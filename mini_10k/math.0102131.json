Introduction\nThis dissertation is concerned with adjoining roots of polynomials over normed algebras. It was originally intended to investigate the Galois theory of topological algebras but this was quickly found to be too ambitious.\nNevertheless we borrow ideas from field theory to form definitions and try to obtain some analogies.\nFirst we show how to adjoin the root of one monic polynomial to a commutative normed algebra with\nunity, A. This construction is then iterated to adjoin roots of arbitrary sets of monic polynomials, and then\nto obtain an extension closed under taking of roots of monic polynomials (integrally closed).\nThere is a similarity with the chain of extensions of Q (say) to include a root of a single irrational\nnumber (say a root of x2 \u2212 2 \u2208 Q[x]), to a field, R, containing the roots of an uncountable set of polynomials\nirreducible over Q, to an algebraically closed field, C. For normed algebras this can be achieved entirely by\na certain type of extension, introduced by Arens and Hoffman in [1]. The simple extension is then iterated\nusing deeper set theory to obtain the 'standard normed extensions' of chapter 5 which contain roots of any\nset of monic polynomials over A. Finally transfinite methods are used on these extensions to obtain an\nintegrally closed normed extension. To illustrate the resemblance:\nalgebraically closed\n\na simple extension\n\nC\nx\n\uf8e6\u03b9\n\uf8e6\n\nC\nx\n\uf8e6\u03b9\n\uf8e6\n\nB\nx\n\uf8e6\u03b9\n\uf8e6\n\nR\nx\n\uf8e6\u03b9\n\uf8e6\n\u221a\nQ( 2)\nx\n\uf8e6\u03b9\n\uf8e6\n\nA\u03b1\nx\n\uf8e6\u03b9\n\uf8e6\n\nintegrally closed\n\na standard extension\n\nan Arens-Hoffman extension\n\nA\n\nQ\n\nThe context of this work in function analysis is described in chapter 7.\nA theme is to determine when various properties (principally completeness and semisimplicity) of the\noriginal algebra are preserved by the types of extension discussed.\nAlong the way we are led to consider, in appendix 2, following suggestions in [1], a Gelfand theory for\nnormed rather than Banach algebras.\nAn application of Arens-Hoffman extensions not directly connected with algebraic extension is included\nin chapter 3.\nArens-Hoffman extensions are not the only type of extensions possible. For example in the category of\nuniform algebras there is a more natural construction available (due to Cole). We attempt to compare the\ntwo methods in the case of a simple extension. Finally in chapter 6 we show that Cole's method can be used\nto construct integrally closed uniform algebra extensions.\n2. Basic Definitions\nAn algebra is a ring, A, which is also a vector space over some field, F, such that for all a, b \u2208 A, \u03bb \u2208 F we\nhave \u03bb(ab) = (\u03bba)b = a(\u03bbb). A normed algebra is an algebra over R or C with a map k * k: A \u2192 [0, +\u221e) such\nthat (A, k * k) is a normed linear space and for all a, b \u2208 A kabk \u2264 kakkbk. If the ring A has a unity, 1, and\nk1k = 1 then we call A unital, and we call A commutative if it is commutative as a ring. We assume that\nthe reader is familiar with normed spaces and with the basic facts of Gelfand theory (listed in appendix 1).\n1\n\n\fGiven an algebra, A, and an element a \u2208 A there are at least three senses in which a might be called\nalgebraic:\n(i) there is a non-zero f (x) \u2208 F[x] : f (a) = 0,\n(ii) there is a non-zero \u03b3(x) \u2208 A[x] : \u03b3(a) = 0,\n(iii) there is n \u2208 N and a0 , . . . , an\u22121 \u2208 A : a0 + * * * + an\u22121 an\u22121 + an = 0.\nPlainly (i) and (iii) are special cases of (ii) when A has a unity. We shall never mean sense (i). If (ii)\nholds then a is algebraic over A. In (iii), a is said to satisfy an equation of integral dependence (over A) or\nto be integral over A. In fact we shall mainly be concerned with integral dependence in this dissertation.\nGiven \u03b3(x) \u2208 A[x] we can ask if there exists a \u2208 A such that \u03b3(a) = 0. If such an a exists it is called a\nroot or zero of \u03b3(x). Sometimes a \u03b3(x) will have no zeros in A and we try to extend A so as to include one.\nTo be more precise we make the following definition:\nDEFINITION 1.1: Let A and B be algebras. B is an extension of A if there exists a monomorphism\n\u03b8: A \u2192 B. B is a unital extension of A if A has a unity, 1, and \u03b8(1) is the unity for B. If A and B are\nnormed then B is an isometric extension of A if there exists an isometric monomorphism \u03b8: A \u2192 B. We\nshall say that B is a topological extension if there is a continuous monomorphism \u03b8: A \u2192 B which is bounded\nbelow (meaning that for some m > 0 we have mkak \u2264 k\u03b8(a)k (a \u2208 A)). In each case \u03b8 is referred to as an\nembedding.\nWe shall sometimes abbreviate 'B is a unital extension of A' to B : A.\nThe insistence on isometric embedding is explained by Lemma 1.3 and because we only distinguish normed\nalgebras up to isometric isomorphism.\nP\nDEFINITION 1.2: Let A\nB be algebras and \u03b8: A \u2192 B be an embedding. Let \u03b3(x) = pk=0 ck xk \u2208 A[x]\nPand\np\nand b \u2208 B : \u03b8(\u03b3)(b) := k=0 \u03b8(ck )bk = 0. Then b is a root of \u03b3(x).\n\nLEMMA 1.3 (the embedding lemma [well-known]): Let A, B be normed unital algebras and \u03b8: A \u2192 B be a\nunital isometric monomorphism. Then there exists a normed algebra, C, and a unital isometric isomorphism\n\u03c6: B \u2192 C such that the inclusion map, \u03b9: A \u2192 C is an isometric embedding and the following diagram is\ncommutative:\n\u03c6\nB \u2212\u2192 C\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03b8 \u0580\u03b9\nA\n\nProof. Omitted. (An exercise in set theory.)\nClearly there are many variants on this.\n3. The Main Problem\nOur first problem is, given an algebra, A, and a set of polynomials, P \u2286 A[x], to find an extension algebra,\nB, in the same category as A and such that \u2200 \u03b1(x) \u2208 P \u2203 b \u2208 B : \u03b1(b) = 0. Here we are identifying \u03b1(x)\nwith its image under the map A[x] \u2192 B[x] induced by the implicit embedding \u03b8: A \u2192 B. Usually we shall\nmake the embedding explicit and write \u03b8(\u03b1)(x) for this.)\nOur second problem is to discuss which properties of the original algebra are preserved in B. This may\ncause us to attempt to construct new types of extension algebra. As hinted above we shall only consider unital\nalgebras and then only attempt to adjoin roots of monic polynomials. We now provide some justification for\nthis.\nComplexification and Unitisation\nIf A is a real normed algebra then it is known (see [2] p. 69) that there exists a complex normed algebra,\nAC , and an isometric monomorphism \u03b8: A \u2192 AC (regarding AC as an algebra over R). Similarly, if A has no\n2\n\n\fidentity we can embed A into a unital normed algebra, A + F ([2] p. 15). Therefore we could take extensions\nof algebra made complex and unital in which our set of polynomials have roots.\nWe are of course neglecting questions such as how the final algebra might behave under changing the\norder of the composite embedding or how the different methods of complexification or unitisation behave\nwith respect to different types of algebraic extension, but these would distract us too much.\nThe reader may also wonder why we do not assume that A is complete, in view of the availability of a\nstandard completion to embed into. The main reason is that we would lose the interesting results of chapter\n3.\nCommutativity\nThis is not so easily swept aside except to say that the whole problem seems much more natural in the\ncommutative context. We can, if the coefficients of all polynomials in P commute, consider extensions of\nthe (maximal or otherwise) commutative subalgebra of A generated by these and the unity, but it seems\ndifficult treat the problem of extending the whole algebra suitably.\nRestriction to Monic Polynomials\nFirst we make the trivial observation that this is really equivalent to the assumption that all polynomials to\nbe considered have an invertible leading coefficient. The reason why we do not consider adjoining roots of\npolynomials with arbitrary leading coefficients is that a general method would tackle the problem of adjoining\ninverses to A. (I.e. to adjoin an inverse of a \u2208 A we would look to the unital extension generated by ax \u2212 1.)\nWe refer the reader to [3] p. 256 for an article on this subject, which is really another problem. (It was\nproved by \u0160ilov that if a \u2208 A, a commutative unital Banach algebra, then there exists a unital extension, B,\ncontaining an inverse for a if and only if a is not a topological zero divisor. So algebraic extension by some\npolynomials is not possible. A much more detailed discussion containing some results on this problem can\nbe found in [4])\nThroughout the rest of this dissertation A will denote a complex, commutative, unital normed algebra. All\nextensions and homomorphisms will be unital unless otherwise stated.\n\n3\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nArens-Hoffman Extensions\n\u0001\nLet R be a commutative ring with unity and \u03b1(x) \u2208 R[x] be monic. Let \u03b1(x) denote the principal\n\u000e\n\u0001ideal\nin R[x] generated by \u03b1(x). \u0001It is well-known that \u03b1(x) has a root in the factor ring B := R[x]\n\u03b1(x) and\nthat \u03bd \u2032 : R \u2192 B ; a 7\u2192 \u03b1(x) + a defines an embedding. The simplicity of this construction is both appealing\nand practical. In the case when R = A is a normed algebra we hope that there exists a norm on B so that\nB : A is an isometric extension.\nThe purpose of this section is relate the work of Arens and Hoffman in [1] where it is shown that not\nonly can this be done but that the resulting extensions have good properties. For example if A is complete\nthen so is B.\nA second concern is whether B is semisimple\u2020 if A is a semisimple Banach algebra. Arens and Hoffman\ngeneralise the notion of semisimplicity to normed algebras and prove their results for these. They make the\nfollowing definition\nDEFINITION 2.1: Let A be a unital normed algebra. A is tractable if the intersection of its closed maximal\nideals is {0}.\nThe motivation for this is explained in appendix 2. Tractability is a stronger condition than semisimplicity\nand when A is complete they are equivalent since then it is well-known that maximal ideals are automatically\nclosed.\nThroughout the rest of this chapter A will denote a commutative unital\n\u000e normed\n\u0001 algebra and \u03b1(x) = a0 +\na1 x + * * * + an\u22121 xn\u22121 + xn a polynomial over A. B will denote A[x]\n\u03b1(x) . The set of all continuous\ncharacters (see appendix 2) on A will be denoted \u03a9(A).\n1. The Main Theorem\n\u0001\nArens and Hoffman's solution is to define a norm on the induced polynomial algebra, A[x], so that \u03b1(x)\nis closed. We then have a norm for B in the standard way (see for example [5] p. 316):\n\u2200 \u03b2(x) \u2208 A[x]\n\n\u0001\n\u03b1(x) + \u03b2(x)\n\nB\n\n:=\n\ninf\n\n\u03b3(x)\u2208(\u03b1(x))\n\nk\u03b3(x) + \u03b2(x)k.\n\n\u0001\nThe reader will remember from the proof of this that the function above still defines a seminorm if \u03b1(x) is\nnot closed. Most of the proof below establishes that a norm can be found for which this seminorm is faithful.\nLEMMA 2.2\u2021: ([6] p. 128) Let R be a commutative ring with unity and\nf (x), g(x) \u2208 R[x]; f (x) =\n\nXn\n\nj=0\n\naj xj , with g(x) =\n\nThen there are unique q(x), r(x) \u2208 R[x] such that\n\nXm\n\nj=0\n\nbj xj monic (bm = 1).\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\ndeg r(x) < deg g(x) and f (x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x)\n\n(\u2217)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nProof. ([6] p. 128): If deg f (x) < deg g(x) then we can take q(x) = 0, r(x) = f (x) so we may assume\nn \u2265 m.\n\u2020 See appendix 1.\n\u2021 With the convention deg(0)=\u2212\u221e.\n4\n\n\fIf n = 0 then f (x) = a0 , g(x) = b0 = 1 6= 0. So we have\nf (x) = a0 = a0 g(x) + 0\np\u2212m\nand the result holds.\nLet p > 0 and suppose the result is true for all n < p. Put\u0001 f1 (x) = f (x)\ng(x).\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u2212 ap x\nThen deg f1 (x) < p so by hypothesis there are q1 (x), r(x) \u2208 R[x] (deg r(x) < deg g(x) ) :\n\nf1 (x) = q1 (x)g(x) + r(x)\n\n\u21d2 f (x) \u2212 ap xp\u2212m g(x) = q1 (x)g(x) + r(x)\n\u21d2 f (x) = q2 (x)g(x) + r(x) where q2 (x) = ap xp\u2212m + q1 (x). r(x) has degree less than m so the existence\nresult now follows from the principle of mathematical induction.\nTo show\nuniqueness,\n\u0001\n\u0001 let f (x), g(x), q(x), r(x) \u2208 R[x] satisfy (*) and q1 (x), r1 (x) \u2208 R[x] also having\ndeg r1 (x) < deg g(x) and f (x) = q1 (x)g(x) + r1 (x). Then\n\u0001\nq(x) \u2212 q1 (x) g(x) = r1 (x) \u2212 r(x).\n\nSo if q(x) 6= q1 (x) then, since g(x) is monic, the degree of the right hand side is at least m, a contradiction.\nSo q(x) = q1 (x) and r1 (x) = r(x).\nTHEOREM 2.3: There exists a norm on B such that B is an isometric extension of A and such that B is\ncomplete if A is.\nProof.

Maximal Ideal Spaces\nWe now turn to the remaining results in [1]. These concern the spaces of continuous characters on A and\nits Arens-Hoffman extension. We recommend that the reader looks at appendix two for the definition and\nmotivation for studying these spaces. In particular it is explained there why we are studying the space of\nclosed maximal ideals rather than all the maximal ideals. (The title of the section is therefore a misnomer,\nbut intended to make the reader think along the right lines with respect to the application of these results.)\nThe content of the following lemma is not actually needed but it introduces some useful notation.\nLEMMA 2.5 ([1]): Let \u03b1(x) be a non-constant monic polynomial over A and let A[x] be given one of the\nnorms above (an 'Arens-Hoffman' norm) with parameter t. Then, letting \u2206t denote the closed disc centre\n0 of radius t in C, we have (up to a homeomorphism) \u03a9 (A[x]) = \u03a9(A) \u00d7 \u2206t . Also: A[x] is tractable if and\nonly if A is tractable.\nProof. (We fill in some of the detail behind\nPp the indentification made in [1].) Set \u03a5: \u03a9(A) \u00d7 \u2206t \u2192\n\u03a9 (A[x]) ; (h, \u03bb) 7\u2192 \u03a5(h, \u03bb) where, for \u03b3(x) = k=0 ck xk \u2208 A[x],\n\u03a5(h, \u03bb)(\u03b3(x)) := h(\u03b3)(\u03bb) :=\n\np\nX\n\nh(ck )\u03bbk .\n\nk=0\n\n\u03a5 is well-defined: Let \u03b3(x) \u2208 A[x] \u03b3(x) =\nhomomorphism. To show it is continuous:\n\nPp\n\nk\nk=0 ck x\n\n\u0001\n. Then it is routine to verify that \u03a5(h, \u03bb) is a\n\np\nX\n\u0001\n\u03a5(h, \u03bb) \u03b3(x) =\nh(ck )\u03bbk\nk=0\n\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\np\nX\n\nk=0\np\nX\n\nk=0\n\n|h(ck )||\u03bb|k\nkck ktk\n\n= k\u03b3(x)k.\n\n(We used the fact, which follows from Lemma A2.7, that, as for characters on Banach algebras, the continuous\ncharacters on normed algebras have norms at most 1.)\nIt is also easily checked that \u03a5 is a bijection; for H \u2208 \u03a9(A[x]) we have \u03a5\u22121 (H) = (H \u25e6 \u03bd \u2032 , H(x)).\nFinally we show that \u03a5 is a homeomorphism when \u03a9(A) \u00d7 \u2206t is given the product topology.\nA is unital and so by A2.6, \u03a9(A) is compact in the weak *-topology. \u2206t is compact by the Heine-Borel\ntheorem and so by Tychonoff's theorem \u03a9(A) \u00d7 \u2206t is compact. Again from a result in appendix 2, \u03a9 (A[x])\nis Hausdorff. It is therefore sufficient to prove that \u03a5 is continuous.\nNow \u03a9 (A[x]) has the weak topology induced by A[x]\u02c6 (the Gelfand transform: see appendix 2) so \u03a5 is\ncontinuous if andPonly if for every \u03b3(x) \u2208 A[x] \u03b3(x)\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03a5 is continuous.\nLet \u03b3(x) = pk=0 ck xk \u2208 A[x].\n\u03b3(x)\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03a5: (h, \u03bb) 7\u2192 \u03b3(x)\u02c6 (\u03a5(h, \u03bb)) = \u03a5(h, \u03bb)(\u03b3(x)) =\n\np\nX\n\nh(ck )\u03bbk .\n\nk=0\n\nLet (h\u03bc , \u03bb\u03bc )\u03bc\u2208M be a net in \u03a9(A) \u00d7 \u2206t with (h\u03bc , \u03bb\u03bc ) \u2192 (h, \u03bb).

So \u03a5 is continuous.\nIt remains to prove that A[x] is tractable if and only if A is tractable. Now A and A[x] are commutative, unital normed algebras so they are tractable if and only if the Gelfand transforms are injective (Theorem\nA2-9). First suppose A[x] is tractable. Let a \u2208 A with \u00e2 = 0. Set \u03b3(x) = a. Then\nfor each H \u2208 \u03a9(A[x]) \u2203 h0 \u2208 \u03a9(A), \u03bb0 \u2208 C : H = \u03a5(h0 , \u03bb0 )\nand so (\u03b3(x)\u02c6)(H) = (\u03b3(x)\u02c6)(\u03a5(h0 , \u03bb0 )) = \u03a5(h0 , \u03bb0 )(a) = h0 (a) = \u00e2(h0 ) = 0.\nwhence \u03b3(x)\u02c6 = 0.\n0\nBut A[x] is tractable so\nPp\u03b3(x) =k ax = 0 so a = 0. Therefore A is tractable. Conversely let A\nBy hypothesis we have that for every\nbe tractable. Let \u03b3(x) =\nk=0 ck x \u2208 A[x] with \u03b3(x)\u02c6 = 0.

By the uniqueness of\nPt p\nk\n\u25e6\nthe Taylor coefficients of the analytic function k=0 h(ck )z on \u2206t we have h(ck ) = 0 k = 0, . . . , p. But h\nis arbitrary and A is tractable so ck = 0 (k = 0, . . . , p). So \u03b3(x) = 0 and A[x] is tractable.\n\nOur next result of Arens-Hoffman, again quoted directly from [1], is the characterisation of the character\nspace of the extension.\n\u0001 We supply a proof for the convenience of the reader.

Again it is enough to\nshow \u2210 is continuous since \u03a9(B) is compact and \u03a9(A) \u00d7 \u2206t is Hausdorff by Lemma A2.6.

It is known that if F is\na field and f (x) = a0 + a1 x + * * * + an\u22121 xn\u22121 + xn \u2208 F [x] then the the sums, qk = qk (a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ), of the\nk-th powers of roots of f (x) (k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1) are polynomials in the coefficients of f (x) and therefore lie in\nF (see [6] Theorem 2.20 p. 139). Given a commutative ring, A, and \u03b1(x) \u2208 A[x] we define qk (a0 , . . . , an\u22121 )\n12\n\n\fto be the corresponding polynomial in a0 , . . . , an\u22121 . Also set K(B) = \u2229M (B) (clearly itself a closed ideal\nof B). Then\nLEMMA 2.12: Let the parameter t for the Arens-Hoffman norm on B be large enough that tk \u2265 kqk k (k =\n0, . . . , n \u2212 1). Then the A embeds isometrically in B/K(B), via the natural epimorphism of B onto this\nfactor algebra.\nProof. Let the natural epimorphism be \u03bdB : B \u2192 B/K(B). It is shown in [1] that the homomorphism\n\u03bd \u2032\u2032 := \u03bdB \u25e6 \u03bd \u2032 is isometric.\nTHEOREM 2.13 ([1]): Let A be a tractable normed algebra. Then there is a tractable normed algebra\nextending A isometrically and in which \u03b1(x) has a root. If A is complete (so that tractability is equivalent\nto semismplicity) then B is a semisimple Banach algebra.\nProof. By the preceding lemma, \u03bd \u2032\u2032 is an isometric monomorphism into the normed algebra C := B/K(B).\nBy Theorem 2.3, B is complete when A is so C will be a Banach algebra when A is. It is obvious that \u03b1(x)\nhas a root in C; it is K(B) + x\u0304 since\n\u03b1(K(B) + x\u0304) = K(B) + \u03b1(x\u0304) = K(B)\nIt therefore remains to check that C is always tractable. That a normed algebra factored by its intersection\nof closed maximal ideals is tractable is true in general and proved in Proposition A2.14.\n\n13\n\n\fChapter 3\n\nExamples and an Application of Arens-Hoffman Extensions\n\n1. Uniform Algebras\nBefore going on to look at general questions about algebraic extensions we introduce some examples of\nnormed algebras which will make useful illustrations. The material in this section is all standard. An\nimportant class is given by the following:\nDEFINITION 3.1: Let X be a non-empty compact Hausdorff space and A be a subalgebra of C(X), the set\nof all continuous maps X \u2192 C. A is a uniform algebra if\n(i) A separates the points of X (meaning that \u2200 \u03ba1 , \u03ba2 \u2208 X \u03ba1 6= \u03ba2 \u21d2 \u2203 f \u2208 A : f (\u03ba1 ) 6= f (\u03ba2 )),\n(ii) the constant map, 1 \u2208 A,\n(iii) A is uniformly closed (i.e. closed with respect to the supremum norm kf k\u221e := sup\u03ba\u2208X |f (\u03ba)|).\nA more general definition can be given where X is replaced by a locally compact Hausdorff space (see\n[8] p. 36) but we shall not need this.\nEXAMPLE 3.2: Let \u2206 = {z \u2208 C : |z| \u2264 1}. A standard example of a uniform algebra is the disc algebra,\nA\u2206 := {f \u2208 C(\u2206) : f is analytic on \u2206\u25e6 }. (We use E \u25e6 to denote the interior of a subset, E, of a topological\nspace.)\nAn extremely useful object associated to any uniform algebra is defined through\nTHEOREM 3.3: Let A be a uniform algebra on X. Then there exists a unique minimal closed set, \u0160(A) \u2286 X\nwith the property that every f \u2208 A attains its supremum on \u0160(A).\nProof. We refer the reader to [8] p. 37.\nDEFINITION 3.4: The set \u0160(A) is called the \u0160ilov boundary of A.\nEXAMPLE 3.5: For the disc algebra,\n\u0160(A) \u2286 \u2202\u2206 by the maximum modulus principle. On the other hand,\n\u0001\nlet \u03b8 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] and set f (z) = 12 (1 + e\u2212i\u03b8 z). Then f \u2208 A but it is easy to see that |f (z)| = 1 = kf k only\noccurs for z = ei\u03b8 . Therefore \u0160(A) = \u2202\u2206.\nThe next standard result will frequently be referred to.\nTHEOREM 3.6: Let A be a uniform algebra on X and \u03b5: X \u2192 \u03a9(A); \u03ba 7\u2192 \u03b5\u03ba where \u2200 \u03ba \u2208 X \u03b5\u03ba : A \u2192\nC; f 7\u2192 f (\u03ba). Then \u03b5 is a homeomorphism onto a closed subset of \u03a9(A).\nProof. The map is well-defined: let \u03ba \u2208 X.\n\u03b5\u03ba (f + \u03bbg) = (f + \u03bbg)(\u03ba) = f (\u03ba) + \u03bbg(\u03ba) = \u03b5\u03ba (f ) + \u03bb\u03b5\u03ba (g)\n\u2200 f, g \u2208 A , \u03bb \u2208 C\n\n\u03b5\u03ba (f g) = (f g)(\u03ba) = f (\u03ba)g(\u03ba) = \u03b5\u03ba (f )\u03b5\u03ba (g)\n\u03b5\u03ba (1) = 1 6= 0,\n\nso \u03b5\u03ba \u2208 \u03a9(A).\n\u03b5 is continuous: Let (\u03ba\u03bb )\u03bb\u2208\u039b be a net in X with \u03ba\u03bb \u2192 \u03ba \u2208 X. Let f \u2208 A. Since f is continuous,\nf\u02c6(\u03b5\u03ba\u03bb ) = \u03b5\u03ba\u03bb (f ) = f (\u03ba\u03bb ) \u2192 f (\u03ba) = f\u02c6(\u03b5\u03ba ).\nSince the topology on \u03a9(A) is the one induced by \u00c2 this shows that \u03b5\u03ba\u03bb \u2192 \u03b5\u03ba as required.\nLet \u03ba, \u03ba\u2032 \u2208 X and suppose \u03b5\u03ba = \u03b5\u03ba\u2032 . This means that\n\u2200f \u2208 A\n\nf (\u03ba) = \u03b5\u03ba (f ) = \u03b5\u03ba\u2032 (f ) = f (\u03ba\u2032 ).\n14\n\n\fSince A separates the points of X this implies that \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032 . So \u03b5 is injective. But \u03a9(A) is Hausdorff (see\nA1.4) and X is compact so the result follows.\n\u03b5\nWe therefore have that each f \u2208 Af\u02c6 (which is defined on \u03a9(A) \u2190\u0593 X) extends f in the sense that f\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03b5 = f .\n\nDEFINITION 3.7: A uniform algebra on X is natural (on X) if the above map, \u03b5, is surjective.\nEXAMPLE 3.8: The disc algebra, A\u2206 , is natural. Let \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(A\u2206 ). Set v = \u03c9(z) where z = id\u2206 . Then\n\u03c9 = \u03b5v . To prove this we quote without proof the standard result that A\u2206 = P (\u2206), the uniform closure\nof the algebra PolC (\u2206), the polynomial maps \u2206 \u2192 C with complex coefficients. So for all f \u2208 A \u2203 (pn ) \u2286\nPolC (\u2206) : pn \u2192 f (nP\u2192 +\u221e). Now \u03c9 is continuous so \u03c9(f ) = limn\u2192+\u221e \u03c9(pn ).\nm\nBut for p(z) = k=0 ak z k \u2208 PolC (\u2206) we have\n\u03c9(p(z)) =\n\nm\nX\n\nak \u03c9(z)k = p(\u03c9(z)).\n\nk=0\n\nThus\n\u03c9(f ) = lim pn (\u03c9(z)) = f (v) = \u03b5v (f ).\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nFinally one last standard property of uniform algebras we shall need:\nPROPOSITION 3.9: Let A be a uniform algebra on X. Then A is semisimple.*\n\u03b5\nProof. By Theorem 3.6, X \u0592\u2192 \u03a9(A) so by A1.3,\n\\\n\nM (A) \u2286\n\n\\\n\n\u03ba\u2208X\n\nker \u03b5\u03ba = {f \u2208 A : \u2200 \u03ba \u2208 X \u03b5\u03ba (f ) = f (\u03ba) = 0} = {0}.\n\n2. Completions of Normed Algebras and Tractability\nThe novel condition of tractability featured heavily in the Arens-Hoffman paper but does not seem to be\ncommonly used in the literature. One might at first think that this is because completing\u2020 a tractable\nnormed algebra gives a semisimple Banach algebra. But we shall show (drawing on results in chapter 1) that\nthis is not always true. This is our first application of Arens-Hoffman extensions to questions other than of\nalgebraic extension. This work is due to Lindberg.\nThere are also lots of other questions which spring to mind. Dr. Feinstein was immediately led to ask\nwhether the operations of forming an Arens-Hoffman extension of a normed algebra and taking its completion\ncommute. This is stated in [9] for quadratic Arens-Hoffman extensions; we now prove the general case which\nhas apparently not been discussed elsewhere. The first part of Lemma 3.10 is a purely algebraic result.\nLEMMA 3.10: Arens-Hoffman extensions satisfy the following universal property. Suppose \u03b8: A2 \u2192 B2\nis a unital algebra extension and that A1 is another unital algebra. Let \u03b11 (x) \u2208 A1 [x] be monic and\nB1 = A1 [x]/ (\u03b11 (x)). Let \u03c60 be a homomorphism A1 \u2192 A2 and y \u2208 B2 be a root of \u03b12 := \u03c60 (\u03b1)(x). Then\nthere is a unique homomorphism \u03c6: B1 \u2192 B2 such that\n\u03c6\n\nB1 \u2212\u2192 B2\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 \u2032\n\uf8e6\u03b8\n\uf8e6\u03bd\n\nA1\n\n\u03c60\n\n\u2212\u2192 A2\n\n* See appendix 1.\n\u2020 See appendix 2.\n15\n\n\fis commutative and such that \u03c6(x\u0304) = y.\nIf B1 : A1 , B2 : A2 are normed and unital with B1 having an Arens-Hoffman norm then \u03c6 is continuous if\n\u03b8, \u03c60 are continuous.\nProof. Let n = deg (\u03b11 (x)). Recall that every coset of B1 has a unique representive of degree less than n.\nPn\u22121\nFor \u03b2(x) = k=0\nbk xk \u2208 A1 [x] define\n\u03c6 (\u03b2(x\u0304)) :=\n\nXn\u22121\nk=0\n\n(\u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c60 )(bk )y k\n\n= \u03b8\u2032 (\u03b2)(y)\n\nwhere \u03b8\u2032 := \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c60 . Thus \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03bd \u2032 = \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c60 , and in particular \u03c6 maps the unity of B1 to the unity of B2 .\nPn\u22121\nPn\u22121\nLet \u03b2(x) = k=0\nbk xk \u2208 A1 [x], \u03b3(x) = k=0\nck xk \u2208 A1 [x], and \u03bb \u2208 C. We have\n\u03c6(\u03b2(x\u0304) + \u03bb\u03b3(x\u0304)) = \u03c6\n=\n=\n\n\u0012X\nn\u22121\nk=0\n\nXn\u22121\n\nk=0\nXn\u22121\nk=0\n\n\u0001\nck + \u03bbdk x\u0304k\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b8\u2032 (ck + \u03bbdk )y k\n\n(\u03b8\u2032 (ck ) + \u03bb\u03b8\u2032 (dk )) y k\n\n= \u03c6(\u03b2(x\u0304)) + \u03bb(\u03c6(\u03b3(x\u0304))\nTo show that \u03b8 is multiplicative remember from Lemma 2.1 that there is a unique r(x) \u2208 A1 [x] : deg(r(x)) <\nn and \u2203 q(x) \u2208 A1 [x] :\nr(x) = \u03b2(x)\u03b3(x) + q(x)\u03b11 (x)\n\n(\u2020)\n\nApplying the natural epimorphism, A1 [x] \u2192 B1 , to (\u2020) we obtain r(x\u0304) = \u03b2(x\u0304)\u03b3(x\u0304). Thus \u03c6(\u03b2(x\u0304)\u03b3(x\u0304)) =\n\u03c6(r(x\u0304)) = \u03b8\u2032 (r)(y).\nOn the other hand \u03b8\u2032 induces a homomorphism of the polynomial algebras:\n\u2032\n\u03b8#\n: A1 [x] \u2192 B2 [x]; \u03b4(x) 7\u2192 \u03b8\u2032 (\u03b4)(x).\n\u2032\nApplying \u03b8#\nto (\u2020) gives \u03b8\u2032 (r)(x) = \u03b8\u2032 (\u03b2)(x)\u03b8\u2032 (\u03b3)(x) + \u03b8\u2032 (q)(x)\u03b8\u2032 (\u03b11 )(x). Following this by the evaluationat-y homomorphism gives \u03b8\u2032 (r)(y) = \u03b8\u2032 (\u03b2)(y)\u03b8\u2032 (\u03b3)(y) = \u03c6(\u03b2(x\u0304))\u03c6(\u03b3(x\u0304)) as required, since we assumed\n\u03b8(\u03c60 (\u03b11 ))(y) = 0.\nUniqueness of \u03c6 is obvious since 1, x\u0304 generate B1 over A.\nIf A1 , A2 , B2 are normed and \u03b8, \u03c60 are continuous (bounded), let t > 0 be a suitable parameter for\nthe Arens-Hoffman\nnorm on B1 . By assumption \u03b8 is also continuous so \u03b8\u2032 is continuous. For arbitrary\nPn\u22121\nk\n\u03b2(x) = k=0 bk x \u2208 A1 [x] we have\n\nk\u03c6(\u03b2(x\u0304))k =\n\u2264\n\nXn\u22121\nk=0\n\n\u03b8\u2032 (bk )y k\n\nXn\u22121\n\n\u2264M\n\nk\u03b8\u2032 (bk )kkykk\nk=0\nXn\u22121\nkbk ktk\nk=0\n\n= M k\u03b2(x\u0304)k,\nwhere M = k\u03b8\u2032 kmaxk=0,...,n\u22121\n\n\u0010\n\nkyk\nt\n\n\u0011k\n\n> 0. So \u03c6 is continuous.\n\n16\n\n\fCOROLLARY 3.11: Let A1 , A2 be commutative unital algebras and \u03c60 be an algebra homomorphism A1 \u2192\nA2 . Let \u03b11 (x) \u2208 A1 [x] be monic, \u03b12 (x) = \u03c60 (\u03b11 )(x), and \u03bdi\u2032 be the canonical embeddings Ai \u2192 Bi :=\nAi [x]/ (\u03b1i (x)) ; a 7\u2192 (\u03b1i (x)) + a (i = 1, 2)*.

Let \u03b11 (x) \u2208 A1 [x] be a monic polynomial, \u03b12 (x) = \u03c60 (\u03b11 )(x). Then we can form the\nArens-Hoffman extensions Bi = Ai [x]/ (\u03b1i (x)) (i = 1, 2) of Ai (i = 1, 2) using the same norm parameter.\nMoreover if \u03c6 is the unique homomorphism extending \u03c60 in the above sense and sending x\u0304 7\u2192 x\u0304 then \u03c6 is an\nisometry and has dense image if \u03c6P\n0 does.\nn\u22121\nProof.

Then with the same Arens-Hoffman norm parameter, t, we\ncan form the Arens-Hoffman extension of the completion, A\u223c , of A. Let this be denoted (A\u223c )\u03b1 . Moreover\n(A\u223c )\u03b1 = (A\u03b1 )\u223c .\nProof. Let (A\u223c , i) be a realisation of\nof A. By the lemma above we can form the Arens\u000e the completion\n\u0001\nHoffman extension (A\u223c )\u03b1 := A\u223c [x]\ni(\u03b1)(x) using the same value of t for the norm function. Moreover,\nby Lemma 3.12, i extends to an isometric monomorphism A\u03b1 \u2192 (A\u223c )\u03b1 with dense image. The result follows\nfrom the uniqueness of completions.\nHaving estabished Theorem 3.12 it makes sense to consider which implications hold between the following\nstatements:\n(a) A is tractable\n* Strictly we should use different symbols for the inderminates of the two polynomial algebras.\n17\n\n\f(b) (A\u03b1 )\u223c is semisimple.\nAnswers to these can be found from results in [9] and [7]. We first indicate why (b) \u21d2 (a).\nTHEOREM 3.14: Let \u03b1(x) be a monic polynomial over A and suppose (A\u03b1 )\u223c is semisimple. Then A is\ntractable.\nProof. By Theorem 3.13 we have that (A\u223c )\u03b1 is semisimple. It will be proved in chapter 5 (Corollary 5.8,\nthough it is obvious from Theorem 2.6, or see [7] for a stronger result) that this implies that A\u223c is semisimple.\nIt now follows from Proposition A2.6 that A is tractable.\nFinally we give an example to show (a) 6\u21d2 (b).\nTHEOREM 3.15 ([9]): There exists a tractable normed algebra, A, and a monic polynomial, \u03b1(x) \u2208 A[x]\nsuch that (A\u03b1 )\u223c is not semisimple.\nProof. The key result used here is Corollary 2.11. The idea of the proof (due to Lindberg who gives a general\nclass of counterexamples in [9]) is to choose A and \u03b1(x) = x2 \u2212 a0 \u2208 A[x] so that on completion A remains\ntractable but a0 becomes a zero divisor so that (A\u223c )\u03b1 is not tractable (which is equivalent to semisimplicity\nin Banach algebras).\nLet A\u2206 denote the disc algebra. Set K = [ 12 , 1], J = K \u222a {0}. A\u2206 is tractable by Proposition 3.9. Define\nf : J \u2212\u2192 C ; w 7\u2212\u2192\n\n(\n\n1\nw\n\nw 6= 0\n\n0\n\nw = 0.\n\nf is continuous on the compactum, J, so by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, there exists a sequence, (fn ), of\n(real) polynomials which converges uniformly to f on J.\nConsider the subalgebra A := A\u2206 |J (:= {g|J : g \u2208 A\u2206 }). Its closure, \u0100, inTC(J) is a realisation of \u00c3.\nFor w \u2208 J we have \u03b5w \u2208 \u03a9(\u0100). As in Proposition 3.9 we have \u2229M (\u0100) \u2286 w\u2208J ker \u03b5w = {0} so that \u0100\nis semisimple. The same observation shows that A is tractable.\nNow let f0 be the inclusion map J \u2192 C. We have\nfn f0 \u2212\u2192\n\n(\n\n1\n\nuniformly on K,\n\n0\n\nuniformly on {0}.\n\nSo fn f0 \u2192 e0 \u2208 \u0100 (n \u2192 +\u221e) where e0 is the characteristic function of K (in J). We have e1 := 1 \u2212 e0 \u2208 \u0100.\nFrom this definition we read off that e1 f0 = 0J . Since e1 , f0 6= 0, f0 is a zero divisor in \u0100. Hence by\nCorollary 2.11, \u0100[x]/(x2 \u2212 f0 ) is not tractable. This means (since it is complete by Theorem 2.3) that it is\nnot semisimple.\n\u0001\u223c\nBut by Theorem 3.13 we have \u0100[x]/(x2 \u2212 f0 ) = A[x]/(x2 \u2212 f0 ) .\nCOROLLARY 3.16 ([9]): The completion of a tractable normed algebra need not be semisimple.\nProof. In the above example, A[x]/(x2 \u2212 f0 ) is tractable because f0 is not a zero divisor in A. (To see this\nsuppose f0 g0 = 0 for g0 \u2208 A. Let g0 = g|J where g \u2208 A\u2206 . We have (zg)|J = 0 whence zg = 0 by the identity\nprinciple. So g is zero on \u2206 \u2212 {0} and therefore everywhere (by continuity).)\n\n18\n\n\fChapter 4\n\nCole's Construction\n\n1. Algebraic Extension of Uniform Algebras\nWe describe a construction for adjoining roots of monic polynomials to a uniform algebra. It was formulated\nby Cole in [10] for square roots but generalises easily to arbitrary monic polynomials. The generalisation is\nvery slight and appears to be known to Lindberg (it is implicit in [11]) although the details do not appear\nin the literature. It is interesting for us because it shows we do not have to leave the category of uniform\nalgebras to adjoin the roots whereas Arens-Hoffman extensions only guarantee the existence of commutative\nBanach algebras with the desired properties.\nPerhaps more immediately striking is that this method allows for roots of arbitrary sets of monic\npolynomials to be added all at once.\nThroughout the rest of this chapter A will denote a uniform algebra on the compact Hausdorff space, X. U\nwill be a fixed, non-empty set of monic polynomials over A. When using \u03b1(x) as an index we will drop the\n(\u03b1)\n(\u03b1)\nindeterminate. Let each \u03b1(x) \u2208 U be given by \u03b1(x) = f0 + * * * + fn(\u03b1)\u22121 xn(\u03b1)\u22121 + xn(\u03b1) for (n(\u03b1))\u03b1\u2208U \u2286 N\n(\u03b1)\n\n(\u03b1)\n\nand f0 , . . . , fn(\u03b1)\u22121 \u2208 A.\n\nTHEOREM 4.1: There exists a uniform algebra, AU , and an isometric monomorphism, \u03c0 \u2217 : A \u2192 AU such\nthat \u2200 \u03b1(x) \u2208 U \u2203 f \u2208 AU : \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1)(f ) = 0.\nProof.

Now by definition, X U is the intersection of a family of zero sets\nof continuous functions and so closed. It follows that X U is compact.\nFrom now on we shall now write \u03c0 \u2217 , p\u03b1 for their restrictions to X U .\nNow define AU to be the closed subalgebra of C(X U ) generated by \u03c0 \u2217 (A) \u222a {p\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 U }. So \u03c0 \u2217 is an\nembedding into this uniformly closed subalgebra of C(X U ). Clearly p\u03b1 is a root of \u03b1(x) for each \u03b1(x) \u2208 U .\nSo to complete the proof it remains to check that AU separates the points of X U but this is obvious because\nA separates the points of X.\nWe include one result on the general properties of such extensions. It is explained in [10], at least for square\nroots, that the operations of passing to the maximal ideal space of a uniform algebra and forming a Cole\ntype of extension commute. We prove a special case here.\nTHEOREM 4.2: Let A be natural. Then AU is natural on X U .\nProof. (cf. [8] p. 195) Let the canonical embeddings X \u2192 \u03a9(A), X U \u2192 \u03a9(AU ) be denoted by \u03b5, \u03b7\nrespectively. We must show that \u03b7 is surjective, given that \u03b5 is. Let \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a9(AU ). Consider \u03c9 := \u03c6\u25e6\u03c0 \u2217 : A \u2192 C.\nIt is a unital homomorphism since it is a composition of them; in other words \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(A). By hypothesis\n\u2203 \u03ba \u2208 X : \u03c9 = \u03b5\u03ba . Thus\n\u2200h \u2208 A\n\u03c6(\u03c0 \u2217 (h)) = h(\u03ba)\n(\u03b1)\n\n(\u03b1)\n\nn(\u03b1)\u22121\n\nNow \u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 U \u03c0 \u2217 (f0 ) + * * * + \u03c0 \u2217 (fn(\u03b1)\u22121 )p\u03b1\n(\u03b1)\n\n+ pn\u03b1 = 0, so applying \u03c6 to this equation gives\n\n(\u03b1)\n\nf0 (\u03ba) + * * * + fn(\u03b1)\u22121 (\u03ba)\u03c6(p\u03b1 )n(\u03b1)\u22121 + \u03c6(p\u03b1 )n(\u03b1) = 0\nHence y := (\u03ba, \u03bb) \u2208 X U where \u03bb = (\u03c6(p\u03b1 ))\u03b1\u2208U .\nLet g \u2208 AU .There is a sequence of polynomials with complex coefficients in the generating elements,\u0001\n\u2217\n\u03c0 (A) \u222a {p\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 U }, with gn \u2192 g (n \u2192 +\u221e). Explicitly let gn = Gn \u03c0 \u2217 (h1 ), . . . , \u03c0 \u2217 (hl(n) ), p\u03b11 , . . . , p\u03b1l(n)\nfor a non-decreasing sequence (l(n))n\u2208N \u2286 N and (hn ) \u2286 A, (\u03b1n ) \u2286 U .

Comparison of Extensions\nWe would now like to compare the two methods of extending a uniform algebra so as to inlude a root of the\npolynomial \u03b1(x) \u2208 A[x]. To do this systematically we modify the appropriate definitions from field theory.\nDEFINITION 4.3: Let A1 , A2 , B1 , B2 be commutative algebras with unities and \u03b8k : Ak \u2192 Bk be unital\nmonomorphisms (k = 1, 2). Let \u03c60 : A1 \u2192 A2 be a unital isomorphism. Then B1 : A2 and B2 : A2 are isomorphic extensions if there exists a unital isomorphism \u03c6: B1 \u2192 B2 making the following diagram commute:\n\u03c6\n\nB1 \u2212\u2192 B2\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\u03b8\n\uf8e6\u03b8\n\uf8e62\n\uf8e61\n\nA1\n\n\u03c60\n\n\u2212\u2192 A2\n20\n\n\fIf A1 = A2 = A and \u03c60 = idA then we shall say that B1 , B2 are isomorphic over A and write B1 \u223c\n=A B2 .\nIf A1 , A2 , B1 , B2 are normed unital algebras and \u03b81 , \u03b82 are continuous and \u03c60 , \u03c6 are homeomorphisms,\nB1 : A1 , B2 : A2 will be called topologically isomorphic extensions. If all maps are isometries then B1 : A1 , B2 : A2\nwill be said to be isometrically isomorphic extensions.\nAll the remaining results in this chapter are apparently new.\nEXAMPLE 4.4: Let A\u2206 be the disc algebra and \u03b1(x) = x2 \u2212 z where z = id\u2206 . Let A\u2032 denote the extension\ngenerated by Cole's method; A\u2032 is the closed subalgebra of C(X \u2032 ) generated by \u03c0 \u2217 (A\u2206 )\u222a{p\u03b1 } in the notation\nfrom above where X \u2032 = {(u, v) \u2208 \u2206 \u00d7 C : v 2 = u} = {(v 2 , v) : v \u2208 \u2206}.\nLet A\u03b1 denote the corresponding Arens-Hoffman extension. Lemma 3.10 shows that\n\u03c6: A\u03b1 \u2192 A\u2032 ; f + g x\u0304 7\u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 (f ) + \u03c0 \u2217 (g)p\u03b1\nis a homomorphism whose image is clearly a dense subspace of A\u2032 . It will follow very easily from a result in\nthe next section that \u03c6 is a topological isomorphism A\u03b1 \u2192 A\u2032 over A\u2206 (the hard part of this is to show that\n\u03c6 is surjective).\nWe could therefore renorm A\u03b1 so as to make \u03c6 an isometry. But the resulting norm will not be an\nArens-Hoffman norm for any choice of norm parameter t > 0.\nTo see this, suppose t > 0 is such that kf + g x\u0304k = kf k + kgkt defines a norm on A\u03b1 so that \u03c6 is an\nisometry. We must have\nt = kx\u0304k = k\u03c6(x\u0304)k = kp\u03b1 k =\n\nsup\n(v 2 ,v):v\u2208\u2206\n\np\u03b1 (v 2 , v) = sup |v| = 1.\nv\u2208\u2206\n\nBut now let f = ( 12 )(z + 1), g = ( 21 )(z \u2212 1). We must have\nkf + g x\u0304k = k\u03c0 \u2217 (f ) + \u03c0 \u2217 (g)p\u03b1 k\n= sup\n\nv\u2208\u2206\n\n\u0001\n\u03c0 \u2217 (f ) + \u03c0 \u2217 (g)p\u03b1 (v 2 , v)\n\n= sup f (v 2 ) + vg(v 2 )\nv\u2208\u2206\n\n= f (e2i\u03b8 ) + ei\u03b8 g(e2i\u03b8 )\nfor some \u03b8 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] by the maximum modulus principle. Thus\nkf + g x\u0304k \u2264 f (e2i\u03b8 ) + g(e2i\u03b8 ) = (1/2) e2i\u03b8 + 1 + e2i\u03b8 \u2212 1\nNow\n\n(\n\n|e2i\u03b8 + 1| < 2 unless \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, and\n\n\u0001\n\n(\u2020)\n\n|e2i\u03b8 \u2212 1| < 2 unless \u03b8 = \u00b1 \u03c02 ,\n\nso (\u2020) shows that 2 = kf k + kgk = kf + g x\u0304k < (2 + 2)/2 = 2, a contradiction.\n3. The Cole-Feinstein Conjecture\nIn this section A will be a uniform algebra on the compactum X ('(A, X) is a uniform algebra'). We shall\n\u03b1\n{\u03b1}\n{\u03b1}\nwrite (A\u03b1 , X\n\u0001 ) for the simple Cole extension (A , X ). The corresponding Arens-Hoffman extension,\nA[x]/ \u03b1(x) , will be denoted A\u03b1 or B as usual.\nIt is easy to give examples where A\u03b1 6= A\u03b1 . For instance, \u0100 of Theorem 3.15 is obviously a uniform algebra\non J but there was a monic polynomial over \u0100 for which the Arens-Hoffman extension was not semisimple\nso it could not be isomorphic to a Cole type of extension because those are semisimple (Proposition 3.9).\n21\n\n\fMore generally, by Corollary 2.11, A[x]/(x2 \u2212 f0 ) cannot be isomorphic to a uniform algebra if f0 \u2208 A\nis a zero divisor or zero.\nHowever Theorem 2.13 states that factoring the Arens-Hoffman extension by its radical, K(B), leads\nto a semisimple isometric extension of A. (Remember that uniform algebras are complete so B is always\ncomplete and so semisimplicity is equivalent to tractability then.) The proper question to ask is therefore\nwhether or not we always have B/K(B) =: C = A\u03b1 . B. J. Cole and J. F. Feinstein conjectured that this is\ntrue but we shall show that there are counterexamples.\nRecall that there is a continuous injection \u03b5: X \u2192 \u03a9(A) and that (modulo \u2210)\n\u03a9(B) = {(h, \u03bb) \u2208 \u03a9(A) \u00d7 \u2206t : \u03a5(h, \u03bb)(\u03b1(x)) = 0}\nXn\u22121\nh(ak )\u03bbk = 0},\n= {(h, \u03bb) \u2208 \u03a9(A) \u00d7 \u2206t :\nk=0\n\nwhere t > 0 is the Arens-Hoffman norm parameter. We exploit the strong resemblance of this with\nX \u03b1 = {(\u03ba, \u03bb) \u2208 X \u00d7 C : a0 (\u03ba) + * * * + an\u22121 (\u03ba)\u03bbn\u22121 + \u03bbn = 0}\nPn\u22121\nkak ktk so we can assume t \u2265 max(1, ka0 k + * * * + kan\u22121 k). Therefore\nNow t only had to satisfy tn \u2265 k=0\nby the lemma in the proof of Theorem 4.1 we have that for every (\u03ba, \u03bb) \u2208 X \u03b1 |\u03bb| \u2264 t. We summarise:\nLEMMA 4.5: \u03c1: X \u03b1 \u2192 \u03a9(B); (\u03ba, \u03bb) 7\u2192 \u2210\u22121 (\u03b5\u03ba , \u03bb) is a homeomorphism onto a closed subspace of \u03a9(B).\nProof. Since \u2210 is a homeomorphism it is enough to check that the map (\u03ba, \u03bb) 7\u2192 (\u03b5\u03ba , \u03bb) is a homeomorphism\nonto a closed subspace of \u03a9(A) \u00d7 \u2206t . (The map is well defined by the comments above.) The codomain is\nHausdorff and X \u03b1 is compact so we only need to check injectivity and continuity. Since \u03b5 is continuous and\ninjective the map composed with each of the canonical projections onto \u03a9(A), \u2206t has these properties and\nthe result follows.\n\u03c1 induces a map \u03c1\u2217 : C(\u03a9(B)) \u2192 C(X \u03b1 ); h 7\u2192 h \u25e6 \u03c1. This map is clearly a (unital) homomorphism. We\nfirst show that it restricts to a map B\u0302 \u2192 A\u03b1 where B\u0302 (\u2286 C(\u03a9(B))) is the image of the Gelfand transform,\n\u0393: B \u2192 B\u0302. By the fundamental isomorphism theorem, \u0393 induces an isomorphism \u0393\u0303: B/K(B) \u2192 B\u0302 of norm\nk\u0393k \u2264 1.\nLEMMA 4.6: \u03c1\u2217 (B\u0302) \u2286 A\u03b1 .\nPn\u22121\nProof. A typical element of B is b = \u03b2(x\u0304) where \u03b2(x) = k=0\nbk xk \u2208 A[x].

Moreover since A\u03b1 is generated by\nim \u03c0 \u2217 \u222a{p\u03b1 }, \u03c1\u2217 has dense image. The last line of the above proof allows us to summarise with a commutative\ndiagram:\n\u03c1\u2217\n\u0393\u0303\nB/K(B) \u2212\u2192 B\u0302 \u2212\u2192 A\u03b1\n\u057f\u03bd \u2032\u2032\n\n\u0580\u03c0\u2217\nA\n\nThere is one immediate positive result:\nPROPOSITION 4.7: Let A be natural on X. Then A\u03b1 = (B\u0302)\u2212 (isometric isomorphism).\nProof. In this case \u03b5 is a homeomorphism so \u03c1 is surjective. Hence for b \u2208 B, k\u03c1\u2217 (b\u0302)k = kb\u0302 \u25e6 \u03c1k = kb\u0302k\nand \u03c1\u2217 is an isometry. Now the unique continuous linear extension of \u03c1\u2217 to \u03c1\u2217 : (B\u0302)\u2212 \u2192 A\u03b1 is therefore also\nisometric. But (B\u0302)\u2212 , A\u03b1 are complete and im \u03c1\u2217 = A\u03b1 so \u03c1\u2217 is surjective (considered as a map (B\u0302)\u2212 \u2192 A\u03b1 ).\nIt is therefore desirable to know when B\u0302 is closed in C(\u03a9(B)) (i.e. complete in the sup-norm). For natural\nuniform algebras this has been worked out by Heuer and Lindberg in [12]. (First recall\nDEFINITION 4.8: a \u2208 A is a topological divisor of zero if \u2203 (un ) \u2286 A : un a \u2192 0 (n \u2192 +\u221e) with \u2200 n \u2208\nN kun k = 1)\nTHEOREM 4.9 ([12] p. 338): Let A be a natural uniform algebra and B = A\u03b1 an Arens-Hoffman extension.\nLet d := discr(\u03b1(x)) not be a zero divisor. Then B\u0302 is sup-norm complete if and only if d is not a topological\ndivisor of zero.\nWe therefore have:\nCOROLLARY 4.10: Let A be natural and d not be a zero divisor. Then A\u03b1 = B\u0302 \u21d0\u21d2 d is not a topological\ndivisor of zero.\nTo give examples of this situation there is a further equivalent condition available:\nTHEOREM 4.11 ([13] p. 137): Let A be a uniform algebra and d \u2208 A. Then d is a topological zero divisor\nif and only if d has a zero on \u0160(A).\nBefore going on, note that the condition on d in Corollary 4.10 is quite strong; if d is not a zero divisor then\nby Theorem 2.10, B is already semisimple. Therefore we can prove the following\nTHEOREM 4.12: Let A be a natural uniform algebra. Then B and A\u03b1 are topologically isomorphic extensions of A if d is not a topological zero divisor.\nProof. Suppose d is not a topological divisor of zero. By Theorem 2.10, K(B) = {0} so that B/K(B) = B\n(to isometric isomorphism). By Proposition 4.7 and Theorem 4.9, A\u03b1 = (B\u0302)\u2212 and (B\u0302)\u2212 = B\u0302. By Banach's\nisomorphism theorem, \u0393\u0303 is a topological isomorphism B/K(B) \u2192 B\u0302.\nThus for example, for the disc algebra, A\u2206 , and \u03b1(x) = x2 \u2212 z we have discr(\u03b1(x)) = 4z (see example 2.9)\nwhich does not vanish on \u0160(A\u2206 ) = \u2202\u2206 (example 3.5) so that Cole's extension is topologically isomorphic to\nthe Arens-Hoffman extension.\nWe have not yet found a counterexample to the Cole-Feinstein conjecture although we do now know that if\nT is a topological isomorphism such that the following commutes\nT\n\nB/K(B) \u2212\u2192\nx\n\uf8e6 \u2032\u2032\n\u0580\u03c0\u2217\n\uf8e6\u03bd\nA\n\n23\n\nA\u03b1\n(\u2020)\n\n\fand T (K(B) + x\u0304) = p\u03b1 then T = \u03c1\u2217 \u25e6 \u0393\u0303. This forces \u03c1\u2217 to be both injective and surjective. \u03c1\u2217 is always a\ncontraction so if B\u0302 is not uniformly closed (i.e. closed in the sup norm) then (when A is natural) we would\nhave a continuous algebraic isomorphism B\u0302 \u2192 (B\u0302)\u2212 which seems strange but not impossible. However for\nour situation this cannot happen and I am very grateful to Dr. Feinstein for pointing out the following result\nto me which is an elementary exercise in uniform algebras:\nLEMMA 4.13 (Dr. Feinstein): Suppose that (B1 , k * k1 ) is a commutative semisimple complex unital Banach\nalgebra and that (B2 , k * k\u221e ) is a uniform algebra. Suppose that T : B1 \u2192 B2 is an algebra isomorphism.\nc1 is complete in the sup\nThen B1 is topologically isomorphic to its the Gelfand transform. In particular B\nnorm.\n1\nn\nProof. Since B2 is a uniform algebra we have for each f \u2208 B2 kf k\u221e = limn\u2192+\u221e kf n k\u221e\n. Now T induces a\nsecond norm, |*| on B1 defined by\n\u2200 b \u2208 B1\n\n1\n\nn\n|b| := kT (b)k\u221e = lim kT (b)n k\u221e\n\nn\u2192+\u221e\n1\n\nn\n\nn\n= lim kT (b )k\u221e\n\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\n1\n\n= lim |bn | n .\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\n(\u2020)\n\nIn this way, T \u22121 is an isometric isomorphism (B2 , k * k\u221e ) \u2192 (B1 , |*|). Since B2 is complete, (B1 , |*|) is\ncomplete. Hence by the (commutative) uniqueness of norm theorem, |*| and k * k1 are equivalent norms.\nc1 has the sup norm inherited from C(\u03a9(B1 )) and by Corollary A1.8 for b \u2208 B1 we have\nNow B\n1\n\nb\u0302 = lim kbn k1n .\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nSince |*| and k * k1 are equivalent norms it follows easily from (\u2020) that the Gelfand transform is continuous\nand bounded below as a map from (B1 , |*|) and so also from (B1 , k * k1 ).\nWe now come to our main result allowing for counterexamples to the Cole-Feinstein conjecture to be found\nvery easily.\nTHEOREM 4.14: Let A be a natural uniform algebra and d = discr(\u03b1(x)) be a topological divisor of zero\nin A, but not zero or a zero divisor. Then there does not exist an (algebraic) isomorphism B/K(B) \u2192 A\u03b1 .\nProof. Suppose A and d satisfy the hypotheses above. Since d is not zero or a zero divisor, B is semisimple\nby Theorem 2.10. So K(B) = {0} and B is isometrically isomorphic to B/K(B) where the latter space has\nthe quotient norm. Suppose for a contradiction that there is an isomorphism T : B \u2192 A\u03b1 . By Lemma 4.13,\nB\u0302 must be complete and this contradicts Theorem 4.9.\nSo for example letting A = A\u2206 , the disc algebra, and f0 = z \u2212 1, \u03b1(x) = x2 \u2212 f0 we have that d = 4(z \u2212 1) is\nnot a zero divisor or zero but is a topological zero divisor (by Theorem 4.11). So by the last theorem, B/K(B)\nand A\u03b1 are essentially different here. [By Proposition 4.7 there is however an embedding B/K(B) \u0592\u2192 A\u03b1 .]\nWe close this chapter by remarking that a condition on \u03b1(x) commonly occurring in the literature\n('separability') on the type of polynomial considered excludes examples like this one.\n\n24\n\n\fChapter 5\n\nIntegral Closure of Banach Algebras\n\n1. Introduction\nIn field theory it is well-known that algebraic closures exist. These are field extensions which contain roots of\nall polynomials over themselves. In other words there is no need to find further extensions in order to adjoin\nroots. In the same way one can obtain extensions which are closed under taking roots of monic polynomials.\nMore precisely:\nDEFINITION 5.1: Let A be a commutative algebra with identity. A is integrally closed if for every monic\n\u03b1(x) \u2208 A[x] \u2203 \u03be \u2208 A : \u03b1(\u03be) = 0. If B: A is an algebra extension and B is integrally closed then B is an\nintegral closure of A.\nNote that we do not ask (here) that every monic polynomial 'splits' completely into linear factors in an\nintegral closure; for results on this problem see [7]. Nor do we ask that integral closure be in any sense\nminimal here.\nThe main theorem in this section is that every Banach algebra has an integral closure (in the same\ncategory). At the moment we can only adjoin roots of finitely many polynomials at a time so our first task\nis to extend this method. Lindberg has made a study of this in [11] so we are reporting his results.\n\n2. Standard Extensions\nLet U \u2286 A[x] be any non-empty set of monic polynomials where A is a commutative algebra with unity.\nWe follow Lindberg by obtaining an algebra extension in which every polynomial in U has a root and then\nconsider the case when A is normed.\nDEFINITION 5.2 ([11]): Let B: A be an algebra extension and U \u2286 A[x] a set of monic polynomials. B: A\nis called a standard extension if there exists a well-ordering, \u2264, on U (with \u03b10 = inf U ) and intermediate\nsubalgebras,\nS (B\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208U such that\n(i) B = \u03b1\u2208U B\u03b1\n(ii) \u2200 \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 U \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u21d2 B\u03b2 : B\u03b1 (with\nrespect to inclusion)\n\u0001\n(iii) \u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 U B\u03b1 \u223c\n=A\u03b1 A\u03b1 [x]/ \u03b1(x) where\n(S\n\u03b10 < \u03b1\n\u03b2<\u03b1 B\u03b2\nA\u03b1 :=\nA\n\u03b10 = \u03b1.\n(Warning: we are using A\u03b1 to mean something different to in previous\nchapters.) Recall that the notation\n\u0001\nin (iii) means that there is an isomorphism \u03c6\u03b1 : B\u0001\u03b1 \u2192 A\u03b1 [x]/ \u03b1(x) satisfying \u03c6\u03b1 (a) = \u03bd\u03b1\u2032 (a) (a \u2208 A\u03b1 ) where\n\u03bd\u03b1\u2032 is the usual embedding A\u03b1 \u2192 A\u03b1 [x]/ \u03b1(x) . It is clear that Arens-Hoffman extensions are standard\nextensions and that the embedding lemma can be used to construct standard extensions from any finite\nsequence of Arens-Hoffman extensions. We should also warn the reader that the definition in [11] is slightly\nmore general in that it allows the polynomial, \u03b1(x), generating each intermediate subalgebra, B\u03b1 , to have\ncoefficients in A\u03b1 rather than A.\nTHEOREM 5.3 ([11]): Let A be a commutative algebra with unity and \u2205 =\n6 U \u2286 A[x] a set of monic\npolynomials. Then there exists a standard extension, BU : A, in which every \u03b1(x) \u2208 U has a root.\nProof. (We follow the outline in [11] and supply extra details for the convenience of the reader.) By the\nwell-ordering principle there exists a well-ordering, \u2264, on U . Let \u03b10 = inf U . We shall need to refer to some\n25\n\n\fresults from set theory in the course of this proof. These are given in appendix 3 to avoid cluttering this\nproof, but the reader may wish to glance at it now to check notations and conventions.\nFirst we require a set, S, with #S > #A and A \u2282 S. (For example P(A) \u222a A could be used for S.) Let\nQ be the set of all maps from initial segments of U to P(S):\nQ := Map(U, P(S)) \u222a\n\n[\n\n\u03b1\u2208U\n\nMap ([\u03b10 , \u03b1), P(S)) .\n\n(U is an initial segment by convention.)

Really what we have written is not adequate,\nbut it is consistent with the universal abuse of language when speaking of 'the algebra A'. An algebra\nis strictly a 4-tuple, (A, S+ , S* , SF\u00d7A ), where S+ , S* \u2286 (A \u00d7 A) \u00d7 A, SF\u00d7A \u2286 (F \u00d7 A) \u00d7 A define addition,\nmultiplication and the action of the field on A. (If A is normed there is also a fifth component, Sk*k \u2286 A\u00d7 R+\ndetermining the norm map.) So it would be more correct to consider a suitable subset of maps, f , into\nS \u00d7 P(S \u00d7 S \u00d7 S) \u00d7 P(S \u00d7 S \u00d7 S) \u00d7 P(F \u00d7 S \u00d7 S),\nbut this level of formality is not appropriate here.\nM 6= \u2205 for the trivial map, \u2205, the single element of Map([\u03b10 , \u03b10 ), P(S)), belongs to M . (The reader can\nbe assured that the 'inductive step' in the proof below will make it clear that there are non-trivial elements\nin M .) For f, g \u2208 M define\nf \u0016g\n\n:\u21d4\n\ndom f \u2286 dom g \u2227 g|dom f = f.\n\nS\nThis clearly defines a partial ordering on M . Suppose \u2205 6= L \u2286 M is totally ordered. Now f \u2208L dom f =: D\nis an initial segment of U for if D \u2282 U we have D = [\u03b10 , \u03b1) where \u03b1 = inf(U \u2212 D). In either case we can\ndefine g: D \u2192 P(S) by \u03b1 7\u2192 f (\u03b1) where f \u2208 L, \u03b1 \u2208 dom f . This is well-defined by the assumption on L and\neasily checked to be a member of M . Since g is an upper bound for L, (M, \u0016) is inductively ordered. By\nZorn's lemma there is a maximal element, f \u2208 M .\nSuppose dom f \u2282 U . We shall show that this leads to a contradiction and then use f to define BU .\nLet \u03b1 = inf(U \u2212 dom f ) so that dom f = [\u03b10 , \u03b1). Set\n(S\n\u03b2<\u03b1 f (\u03b2) \u03b10 < \u03b1\nA\u03b1 :=\nA\n\u03b10 = \u03b1.\nThus A\u03b1 is an algebra extension of A when it is given the obvious structure (which is well-defined by the\nconditions in M ).\nWe claim that #A\u03b1 = #A. Now since U \u2286 A[x] and #A[x] = #A (Lemma A3.4) it is enough (Lemma\nA3.3) to show that \u2200 \u03b2 < \u03b10 #f (\u03b2) = #A. This we do by transfinite induction.\nLet J = {\u03b2 < \u03b1 : #f (\u03b2) = #A} and suppose [\u03b10 , \u03b2) \u2286 J.\nNow f (\u03b2) \u223c\n= f \u0303(\u03b2)[x]/(\u03b2(x)) so #f (\u03b2) = #f \u0303(\u03b2)[x]/(\u03b2(x)). Recall from chapter 2 that since f \u0303(\u03b2) is a\ncommutative ring with unity this factor algebra is identifiable setwise with\n\ndeg(\u03b2(x))\u22121\n\n\u00d7\n\nk=0\n\nf \u0303(\u03b2). This last set has\n\ncardinality #f \u0303(\u03b2) by Lemma A3.2 (all our algebras will be infinite). But by definition of f \u0303(\u03b2), the inductive\nhypothesis, and Lemma A3.3 again, #f \u0303(\u03b2) = #A. Therefore \u03b2 \u2208 J and the claim follows from the principle\nof transfinite induction.\n26\n\n\f\u0001\nNow form B\u03b1\u2032 := A\u03b1 [x]/ \u03b1(x) . By the claim and by the same reasoning as for the factor algebra\nconsidered just above, #B\u03b1\u2032 = #A. Let \u03bd \u2032 be the usual embedding of A\u03b1 into this algebra. We shall need a\nvariant of the embedding lemma to complete the diagram below:\nB\u03b1\u2032 * * * \u2192 B\u03b1 \u2286 S\nx\n\uf8e6 \u2032\n\uf8e6\u03bd \u0580\u2286\n\nA\u03b1\nx\n\uf8e6\u2286\n\uf8e6\nA\n\nBy assumption, #S > #A = #A\u03b1 so #(S \u2212 A\u03b1 ) > #A = #B\u03b1\u2032 \u2265 #(B\u03b1\u2032 \u2212 im \u03bd \u2032 ). Let i be an injection\n \u0307 \u03b1 and let it have the algebraic structure determined\nB\u03b1\u2032 \u2212 im \u03bd \u2032 \u2192 S \u2212 A\u03b1 . Define the subset f1 (\u03b1) := im i \u222aA\nby the induced bijection B\u03b1\u2032 \u2192 f1 (\u03b1). Thus f1 (\u03b1) is a commutative algebra unitally extending A\u03b1 .\ni\nB\u03b1\u2032 \u2212 im \u03bd \u2032\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nim i\n\nB\u03b1\u2032\n\nS\nim \u03bd \u2032\n\n\u2190\u2212\n\nA\u03b1\n\n\u03bd\u2032\nDefine f1 (\u03b2) = f (\u03b2) for \u03b2 < \u03b1. If U = [\u03b10 , \u03b1] then dom f1 is an initial segment of U . In the case\nU \u2283 [\u03b10 , \u03b1] we have dom f1 = [\u03b10 , inf(U \u2212 [\u03b10 , \u03b1])), also an initial segment of U . It is routine to check that\nf1 satisfies (i),(ii),(iii) so that f1 \u2208 M . However we have f1 \u227b f , a contradiction.\nTherefore dom f0 = U and we define\n[\nBU :=\nf (\u03b1)\n\u03b1\u2208U\n\nIn this way BU is a standard extension of A relative to (B\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208U where \u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 U B\u03b1 := f (\u03b1). We have that\n\u2200 \u03b1(x) \u2208 U \u03b1(x) has a root in B\u03b1 \u2286 BU by condition (iii).\nSo we have solved the algebraic problem. We next consider the normability of such extensions.\nTHEOREM 5.4 ([11]): Let (A, k * kA ) be a commutative unital normed algebra and B a standard extension\nof A with respect to (B\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208U where\n\u0001 U 6= \u2205 is a well-ordered\u0001 set of monic polynomials over A.

This is an application of the transfinite recursion theorem, which we use informally.\nBy assumption the following commutes for all \u03b1 \u2208 U :\n\u0001\n\u03c6\u03b1\nA\u03b1 [x]/ \u03b1(x)\nB\u03b1 \u2212\u2192\n\u223c\n=\nx\n\uf8e6\u2286\n\uf8e6 \u0580\u03bd\u03b1\u2032\nA\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03bd\u03b1\u2032 is our usual embedding of an algebra into its Arens-Hoffman extension; it will be an isometry\nwhatever value is chosen for the norm parameter.\n27\n\n\fLet \u03b3 \u2208 U and suppose that for all \u03b1 < \u03b3, B\u03b1 has a norm k * k\u03b1 and t\u03b1 > 0 (\u03b1 < \u03b3) are such that\n(i) \u2200 \u03b1 < \u03b2 < \u03b3 k * k\u03b2 extends k * k\u03b1\n(ii) \u2200 \u03b2 < \u03b3 \u03c6\u03b2 is an isometry when A\u03b2 has norm the restriction of k * k\u03b2 and A\u03b2 [x]/ (\u03b2(x)) is given an\nArens-Hoffman norm with parameter t\u03b2 .\nS\nNow A\u03b3 = \u03b2<\u03b3 B\u03b2 so by assumption (i), ((B\u03b2 , k * k\u03b2 ))\u03b2<\u03b3 induce a well-defined norm on A\u03b3 . Choosing\nt\u03b3 > 0 according to the condition in Theorem 2.3 makes A\u03b3 [x]/ (\u03b3(x)) into an Arens-Hoffman extension when\ngiven an Arens-Hoffman norm. We can now define a norm, k * k\u03b3 , on B\u03b3 by declaring \u03c6\u03b3 to be an isometry.\nBy the comments in the first paragraph the system ((B\u03b2 , k * k\u03b2 ))\u03b2\u2264\u03b3 satisfies (i), (ii) above but with '< \u03b3'\nreplaced with '\u2264 \u03b3'. The result now follows.*\n\n3. Integral Closure\nWe are now in a position to prove the main theorem of this chapter. It is a simplification of a result stated\nin [11] and the proof is too.

Then there is a Banach algebra\nextension, (C, k * kC ), which is integrally closed.\nProof. Let \u03c91 denote the first uncountable ordinal, and 0 the first ordinal. Let, for \u03b3 \u2208 [0, \u03c91 ], p(\u03b3) be the\nproposition 'There exist Banach algebras, (C\u03b1 , k * k\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03b3 such that:\n(i)\n(C0 , k * k0 ) = (A, k * kA )\n(ii)\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03b3\n(C\u03b2 , k * k\u03b2 ) is a unital Banach algebra extension of (C\u03b1 , k * k\u03b1 ) with respect to \u2286\n(iii)\n\u2200 \u03b1 < \u03b2 < \u03b3 \u2200 monic \u03bc(x) \u2208 C\u03b1 [x] \u2203 \u03be \u2208 C\u03b2 : \u03bc(\u03be) = 0.'\nSuppose \u03b3 < \u03c91 and that p(\u03b3) holds. We must show that we can choose a Banach algebra, (C\u03b3 , k * k\u03b3 ),\nso that the family (C\u03b1 , k * k\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b3 satisfies (i)-(iii) above. This is obvious if \u03b3 = 0 so let 0 < \u03b3.\nS\nSet A\u03b3 = \u03b1<\u03b3 C\u03b1 and give A\u03b3 the [well-defined] algebraic operations and norm, k * kA\u03b3 , induced by\nthe subalgebras (C\u03b1 , k * k\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03b3 .\nBy Theorem 5.4 we can form a standard normed extension, (B\u03b3 , k * kB\u03b3 ) of (A\u03b3 , k * kA\u03b3 ) in which every\nmonic polynomial over A\u03b3 has a root. Recall that in this construction the unital embedding was given by\ninclusion. Therefore every monic polynomial over C\u03b1 (\u03b1 < \u03b3) has a root in B\u03b3 .\nB\u03b3 may not be complete so we form its completion, B\u03b3\u223c . By the embedding lemma, there exists a\nBanach algebra, (C\u03b3 , k * k\u03b3 ), containing A\u03b3 as a subalgebra, extending its norm and such that there is an\nisometric isomorphism \u03c6: B\u03b3\u223c \u2192 C\u03b3 with \u03c6\u25e6j = \u03b9 where j is the embedding of B\u03b3 in B\u03b3\u223c and \u03b9 is the inclusion\nmap B\u03b3 \u2192 C\u03b3 .\nLet \u03b1 < \u03b3 and \u03bc(x) \u2208 C\u03b1 [x] be monic. So \u03bc(x) is a monic polynomial over A\u03b3 and so there is\n\u03be \u2208 B\u03b3 : \u03bc(\u03be) = 0. But B\u03b3 \u2286 C\u03b3 so p(\u03b3 + 1) is satisfied by this family of Banach algebras.\nTherefore p(\u03c91 ) holds; let (C\u03b1 , k * k\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03c91 be a family of Banach algebras satisfying p(\u03c91 ).\nS\nSet C = \u03b1<\u03c91 C\u03b1 and give C the usual induced algebraic structure and norm. It remains to check\nthat C is complete and integrally closed.\nLet (cn ) \u2286 C be a Cauchy sequence. So \u2203n\u2208N \u03b1n < \u03c91 : \u2200 n \u2208 N cn \u2208 C\u03b1n . As in the proof of Theorem\nA3.20, \u2203 \u03b1 < \u03c91 : \u2200 n \u2208 N \u03b1n < \u03b1. So (cn ) \u2286 C\u03b1 . But C\u03b1 is complete so \u2203 c \u2208 C\u03b1 \u2286 C: cn \u2192 c (n \u2192 +\u221e).\nThus C is complete.\nFinally let \u03bc(x) be a monic polynomial over C. It has finitely many coefficients so \u2203 \u03b1 < \u03c91 : \u03bc(x) \u2208\nC\u03b1 [x]. But then \u03bc(x) has a root in C\u03b1+1 \u2286 C. So C is integrally closed.\n* The reader may be more familiar with this type of informal inductive definition when U is replaced by\nan initial segment of some ordinal number. However there is no essential difference in view of result A3.16\nof appendix three.\n28\n\n\f4. Maximal Ideal Spaces\nThis chapter could really have been called 'standard extensions' and though their main application here was\nto form an integral closure of an arbitrary Banach algebra they generalise Arens-Hoffman extensions. One\ncan ask if the results of chapter two also generalise. The first thing to note is that the method of obtaining\na standard normed extension from a set of monic polynomials, U \u2286 A[x], will not generally give a Banach\nalgebra, even if A is Banach. The details of exactly when what has been called BU is Banach (given A is\ncomplete) have been worked out in [11].\nWe turn our attention instead to determining the space of continuous characters (so again our section\ntitle is a deliberate misnomer) of a standard normed extension and are able to generalise Theorem 2.6 directly.\nThis refines a remark in [11] (for our definitions) that the map induced by taking restrictions \u03a9(BU ) \u2192 \u03a9(A)\nis surjective. (The reasoning is different: we obtain \u03a9(BU ) explicitly whereas Lindberg makes use of the fact\n(which there is not space to discuss here) that standard extensions are examples of 'integral extensions'.)\nFor rest of this chapter U will be a non-empty set of monic polynomials over A:\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 U\n\n(\u03b1)\n\n\u03b1(x) = a0\n\n(\u03b1)\n\n+ * * * + an(\u03b1)\u22121 xn(\u03b1)\u22121 + xn(\u03b1) .\n\n\u2264 will be a well-ordering on U with least element \u03b10 .\n\nTHEOREM 5.6: Let B := BU be the generalised Arens-Hoffman extension of the normed algebra A as in\nTheorem 5.4.

Now \u2203 \u03b1 < \u03b2 : a \u2208 B\u03b1 (or a \u2208 A; it makes no difference in the following\nargument but where we write B\u03b1 we do mean 'B\u03b1 or A').\nLet H\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9(B\u03b1 ).\n31\n\n\fNow A\u03b2 is a standard normed extension of A relative to (B\u03b3 )\u03b3<\u03b2 so by Corollary 5.7,\n\u2203 H \u2208 \u03a9(A\u03b2 ) : H\u03b1 = H|B\u03b1 .\n\u21d2 H\u03b1 (a) = H(a) = 0. Thus a \u2208 K(B\u03b1 ) = (0) since B\u03b1 is tractable by hypothesis.\nSo A\u03b2 is tractable. Now d\u03b2 is not zero or a zero divisor in A\u03b2 by Lemma 5.11 so by Theorem 2.10,\nA\u03b2 [x]/(\u03b2(x)), which is isometrically isomorphic to B\u03b2 , is tractable.\nBy the principle of transfinite induction J = U and it now follows from Corollary 5.7 again (with a\nproof as in the case of A\u03b1 ) that B is tractable.\nIn fact the converse is also true and the proof is another straightforward induction. However it relies on the\nresult being true in the simple case (Corollary 9.3 of [7]) so we omit this.\n\n32\n\n\fChapter 6\n\nIntegral Closure of Uniform Algebras\n\n1. Introduction\nIn Cole's thesis the main example features a method for constructing uniform algebra extensions closed\nunder taking square roots and Lindberg remarks in [11] that the same techniques can be used to construct\nan integrally closed uniform algebra which isometrically extends any given uniform algebra, (A, X). We give\nthe details explicitly here.\n\n2. Inverse and Direct Systems\nThe basic result is that there is a canonical way of forming transfinite extensions of uniform algebras and\nit is this pre-existing construction which Cole exploits in [10]. In anticipation of the definition to be given\nbelow, the result is that 'direct limits' of uniform algebras always exist (we shall prove a weaker result here).\nFor the general categorical definitions of direct and inverse systems and their limits we refer the reader to\n[15], but it is easy to see what they are from the definitions below.\nThroughout the rest of this chapter, \u03c5 will denote a fixed ordinal number greater than zero.\n\nDEFINITION 6.1: Let (X\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03c5 be a family of topological spaces and (\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b2<\u03c5 a family of continuous\nmaps where \u2200 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03c5 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2208 C(X\u03b2 , X\u03b1 ). We say that ((X\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03c5 , (\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b2<\u03c5 ) is an inverse system of\ntopological spaces if\n(i) \u2200 \u03b1 < \u03c5 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b1 = idX\u03b1\n(ii) \u2200 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b3 < \u03c5 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b3 = \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 \u25e6 \u03c0\u03b2,\u03b3 .\nAn inverse limit for the system above is a pair (X\u03c5 , (\u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5 )\u03b1<\u03c5 ) where X\u03c5 is a topological space and\n\u2200 \u03b1 < \u03c5 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5 \u2208 C(X\u03c5 , X\u03b1 ) are such that\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03c5\n\n\u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5 = \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 \u25e6 \u03c0\u03b2,\u03c5\n\nand such that the following universal property is satisfied: Whenever Y\u03c5 is a topological space and \u2203\u03b1<\u03c5 \u03c1\u03b1,\u03c5 \u2208\nC(Y\u03c5 , X\u03b1 ) : \u2200 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03c5 \u03c1\u03b1,\u03c5 = \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 \u25e6 \u03c1\u03b2,\u03c5 then there is a unique \u03c1\u03c5 \u2208 C(Y\u03c5 , X\u03c5 ) :\n\u2200\u03b1 < \u03c5\n\n\u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5 \u25e6 \u03c1\u03c5 = \u03c1\u03b1,\u03c5\n\nThis is written\nX\u03c5 = lim\u03b1 X\u03b1 .\n\u21bd\n\nIn general there is no guarantee that an inverse limit will exist or be non-trivial. However we have the\nimportant result below:\nTHEOREM 6.2: Let ((X\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03c5 , (\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b2<\u03c5 ) be an inverse system of non-empty compact Hausdorff spaces.\nThen an inverse limit exists and is a non-empty compact Hausdorff space.\nProof. (From [16].): Define K = \u00d7\u03b1<\u03c5 X\u03b1 and let \u03c0\u03b1 : K \u2192 X\u03b1 be the canonical projection (\u03b1 < \u03c5).

By exercise\n3C of [17] the set on which two continuous maps into a Hausdorff space agree is closed so the F\u03b2 are closed.\nHence X\u03c5 is a closed and therefore compact subset of K.\nTo check that X\u03c5 is non-empty it is enough, since it isTnow known to be compact and therefore has the\nn\nfinite intersection property, to show that \u2200 \u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2n < \u03c5 k=1 F\u03b2k 6= \u2205.\nWe first need to know that \u2200 \u03b2 < \u03c5 F\u03b2 6= \u2205.\nLet \u03b2 < \u03c5 and choose \u03ba\u03b2 \u2208 X\u03b2 and for \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 let \u03ba\u03b1 = \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03ba\u03b2 ).

So \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2\n(f1 ) + f2 \u2208 I0 .\ng1 + g2 = \u03c0\u03b2,\u03c5\n\nSo if we can define \u03c0\u03c5\u2217 on I0 to be a homomorphism with norm at most 1 satisfying (\u2020) then (since B\u03c5\nis a Banach space) there is a unique continuous linear extension to a map A\u03c5 \u2192 B\u03c5 with norm at most 1.\nBy continuity the extension will be a homomorphism.\n\u2217\nSet T0 : I0 \u2192 B\u03c5 ; g 7\u2192 \u03c6\u03b1,\u03c5 (f ) where g = \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5\n(f ), f \u2208 A\u03b1 , \u03b1 < \u03c5. T0 is well-defined: suppose \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03c5\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nand g = \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5 (f ) = \u03c0\u03b2,\u03c5 (f ) for f \u2208 A\u03b1 , f \u2208 A\u03b2 . Now \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5\n= \u03c0\u03b2,\u03c5\n\u25e6 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2\nso \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5\n(f ) = \u03c0\u03b2,\u03c5\n(\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2\n(f )) =\n\u2217\n\u2032\n\u2217\n\u2032\n\u2217\n\u03c0\u03b2,\u03c5 (f ). But \u03c0\u03b2,\u03c5 is surjective so \u03c0\u03b2,\u03c5 is a monomorphism (in fact isometric, as noted above). So f = \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2\n(f )\n\u2217\n\u2032\n\u21d2\n\u03c6\u03b1,\u03c5 (f ) = (\u03c6\u03b2,\u03c5 \u25e6 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 )(f ) = \u03c6\u03b2,\u03c5 (f ).\nSimilar calculations show that T0 is a homomorphism. We also have that T0 is a contraction for if\n\u2217\ng = \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5\n(f ), f \u2208 A\u03b1 then\n\u2217\nkT0 (g)k = k\u03c6\u03b1,\u03c5 (f )k \u2264 kf k = k\u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5\n(f )k = kgk.\nSo the required map \u03c0\u03c5\u2217 : A\u03c5 \u2192 B\u03c5 exists.\n35\n\n\f3. Universal Root Algebras\nWe can now apply the machinery above to obtain a 'universal root algebra' (an integrally closed extension\nalgebra) by mimicking Cole's work. This is almost certainly repeating the work of Lindberg.\nTHEOREM 6.5 Let (A, X) be a uniform algebra. Then there exists an integrally closed uniform algebra\nwhich is an isometric extension of A.\nProof. Let \u03c91 denote the first uncountable ordinal. Now let \u03b3 < \u03c91 and suppose we have chosen uniform\nalgebras, (A\u03b1 , X\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03b3 , and continuous surjections, (\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b2<\u03b3 , such that\n(i) ((X\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03b3 , (\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b2<\u03b3 ) is an inverse system\n(ii) (A0 , X0 ) = (A, X)\n(iii) \u2200 \u03b2 < \u03b3, if \u2203 \u03b1 < \u03b2 : \u03b2 = \u03b1 + 1 * then (A\u03b2 , X\u03b2 ) is the Cole-extension as in Theorem 4.1 taken with\nrespect to U\u03b1 , the set of all monic polynomials over A\u03b1 and \u2200 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03b3 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 is the associated projection\n(X\u03b1 )U\u03b1 = X\u03b1 \u00d7 CU\u03b1 \u2192 X\u03b1 .\n(iv) \u2200 \u03b2 < \u03b3, if \u03b2 is a limit ordinal then A\u03b2 is the direct limit of (A\u03b1 , X\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03b2 and (\u03c0\u03b1,\u03c5 )\u03b1<\u03c5 are as described\nin Theorem 6.4.\nThere are two cases. If \u03b3 = \u03b2 + 1 for some \u03b2 < \u03b3 then we (are forced to) define (A\u03b3 , X\u03b3 ) to be the\nuniform algebra generated according to Theorem 4.1 by the set of all monic polynomials over A\u03b2 . For \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b3\nset\n\uf8f1\n\u03b1=\u03b3\nidX\u03b3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b3 = the coordinate projection \u03c0\u03b2,\u03b3 : X\u03b3 \u2192 X\u03b2 \u03b1 = \u03b2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 \u25e6 \u03c0\u03b2,\u03b3\n\u03b1 < \u03b2.\nAll maps on the right hand side are surjective and continuous so the same is true of \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b3 (\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b3).\nThe other case is when \u03b3 is a non-zero limit ordinal. Define ((A\u03b3 , X\u03b3 ), (\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b3 )\u03b1<\u03b3 ) to be the uniform\nalgebra constructed out of the existing system according to Theorem 6.4 (and let \u03c0\u03b3,\u03b3 = idX\u03b3 , the identity\nmap on X\u03b3 ).\nIn each case ((X\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b3 , (\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b2\u2264\u03b3 ) is an inverse system of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous\nsurjections and (i)-(iv) are plainly satisfied by the extended system of uniform algebras. By the transfinite\nrecursion theorem we obtain such a family of uniform algebras with \u03b3 = \u03c91 .\nIt is clear that \u03c91 is a limit ordinal. Therefore by (iv),\n[\n\u2217\nA\u03c91 =\n(A\u03b1 )\n\u03c0\u03b1,\u03c9\n1\n\u03b1<\u03c91\n\nS\n\u2217\n(A\u03b1 ) is a subalgebra (similar\nthe closure being taken in C(X\u03c91 ). This follows from the facts that \u03b1<\u03c91 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c9\n1\nto the result seen in the proof of Theorem 6.4) and that the closure of a subalgebra is a subalgebra. We also\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(A\u03b1 ) is closed \u2200 \u03b1 < \u03c91\nis an isometry (\u03b1 < \u03c91 ). Hence \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c9\nsaw in the proof of Theorem 6.4 that \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c9\n1\n1\n(since A\u03b1 , C(X\u03c91 ) are complete).\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n= \u03c0\u03b2,\u03c9\n(A\u03b1 ) \u2286 \u03c0\u03b2,\u03c9\nAlso the relation \u2200 \u03b1 \u2264S\u03b2 < \u03c91 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c9\n\u25e6 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2\nshows that \u2200 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03c91 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c9\n(A\u03b2 ).\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2217\nHence by Theorem A3.20, \u03b1<\u03c91 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c91 (A\u03b1 ) is closed. Therefore\n[\n\u2217\n(A\u03b1 ).\n\u03c0\u03b1,\u03c9\nA\u03c91 =\n1\n\u03b1<\u03c91\n\n\u2217\n(A\u03b1 ) for some \u03b1 < \u03c91 and\nNow if \u03bc(x) is a monic polynomial over A\u03c91 then it is monic over \u03c0\u03b1,\u03c9\n1\n\u2217\n\u2217\ngives\ntherefore has a root in \u03c0\u03b2,\u03c91 (A\u03b2 ) where \u03b2 = \u03b1 + 1. So A\u03c91 is integrally closed. Finally note that \u03c00,\u03c9\n1\nan isometric embedding A \u0592\u2192 A\u03c91 .\n\nWe therefore have refined Theorem 5.5 to the category of uniform algebras. One can also investigate\nthe inheritance properties of these 'universal root extensions'. For example Theorem 4.2 generalises: if A is\nnatural on X then A\u03c91 is natural on X\u03c91 . This can be proved in exactly the same way as the corresponding\nresult for the square-root closed extensions mentioned before; see for example [18] p. 103.\n* See appendix 3\n36\n\n\fChapter 7\n\nConclusion\n1. Conclusions\nWe have explored two methods for extending uniform algebras by roots of monic polynomials, one of which\napplies to general commutative normed unital algebras. We have seen that integrally closed extensions\nalways exist in both categories of algebras.\nThe two constructions have well-understood properties, and, as we have seen lead to essentially different\nsolutions.\nWe have taken a simplified view of the literature. There have been many contributions (mainly by\nLindberg) on properties of Banach algebras with respect to Arens-Hoffman extensions which we have not\nconsidered. For example (for appropriate initial algebras) naturality, normality, regularity, the \u0160ilov boundary, indecomposability and involutions. (See [7].)\nAnother topic not covered here is on 'integral extensions'. Standard extensions are examples of integral\nextensions and they can be used to investigate the purely algebraic questions on them; see [11].\n\n2. Context\nApart from the minor application in Corollary 3.16, Arens-Hoffman extensions' mainly feature in the literature in connection with Galois theory for Banach algebras where they play a very important role. However\nin some versions of this they are not sufficient (there are 'Galois extensions which are not Arens-Hoffman\nextensions' mentioned in [19]).\nArens-Hoffman extensions also feature in some examples in the literature on function algebras. For\nexample, Karahanjan uses them in [14] to construct an example of a uniform algebra with certain properties.\nThis was the area of Cole's work in [10] where he used a universal root algebra to disprove a certain conjecture.\n\n3. Further Questions\nIn addition to the properties mentioned in the first section there are other inheritance properties of ArensHoffman extensions it might be interesting to investigate; for example the popular C* property. Also the\nwork in section 5.4 suggests that many of these results will lift to standard extensions.\nThe corresponding results for extension of uniform algebras by Cole's methods have not been studied\nas much in the literature so it is important to know precisely when such extensions can be realised via\nArens-Hoffman extensions.\nWe would also like to be able (if possible) to generalise the result at the end of chapter two so that every\ntractable normed algebra can be embedded in a tractable normed algebra extension which contains roots of\nan arbitrary large set of monic polynomials (which may have to be restricted in some other way).\n\n37\n\n\fAppendix 1\n\nAssumed Gelfand Theory\n\nGelfand theory is a tool used to investigate normed algebras. It identifies arbitrary normed algebras with\ncomplex function algebras via a map, \u0393, to be defined below. We list the definitions and results which are\nused in the dissertation. This material is standard and proofs can be found in many introductory books on\nfunctional analysis, for example [5] chapters 12 and 13 or [20] chapters 1 and 2.\nLet A be a commutative unital Banach algebra.\nDEFINITION A1.1: The maximal ideal space and character (carrier) space of A are respectively\nM (A) := {I \u2286 A: I is a maximal ideal of A},\n\nand\n\n\u03a9(A) := HomC (A, C) \u2212 {0}.\n\nThe topologies on these two sets are defined below. Recall that A\u2217 = B(A, C) has a topology called the weak\n*-topology, the initial topology induced by the evaluation-at-a linear functionals (a \u2208 A).\nTHEOREM A1.2: \u03a9(A) \u2286 A\u2217 .\nTHEOREM A1.3: M (A) 6= \u2205 and \u03bc: \u03a9(A) \u2192 M (A); \u03c9 7\u2192 ker \u03c9 is a bijection.\nThe topology on \u03a9(A) is the subspace topology relative to the weak *-topology. The topology on M (A) is\nthe one obtained by using \u03bc to identify the two sets.\nTHEOREM A1.4: \u03a9(A) is a compact Hausdorff subspace of A\u2217 in the weak *-topology.\nDEFINITION A1.5: The Gelfand transform of A is the map \u0393: A \u2192 C(\u03a9(A)); a 7\u2192 \u00e2 where\n\u2200 a \u2208 A, \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(A)\nTHEOREM A1.6:\n(i) \u0393 is a contractive (norm-decreasing) homomorphism\n1\n(ii) \u2200 a \u2208 A k\u00e2k = r(a) = limn\u2192+\u221e kan k n\n(iii) \u2200 a \u2208 A im \u00e2 = \u03c3(a)\n(iv) ker \u0393 = \u2229M (A).\nDEFINITION A1.7: A is semisimple if \u2229M (A) = {0}.\nCOROLLARY A1.8:\n(i) \u0393 is injective \u21d0\u21d2 A is semisimple\n(ii) \u0393 is isometric \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200 a \u2208 A ka2 k = kak2 .\n\n38\n\n\u00e2(\u03c9) := \u03c9(a).\n\n\fAppendix 2\n\nGelfand Theory for Normed Algebras\n\nWhile Gelfand theory is usually expounded for Banach algebras it is interesting to study its generalisation to\nnormed algebras in its own right as well for its use as a tool to investigate incomplete normed algebras. Most\nof the results presented below seem to be well-known but not to be found explicitly stated in the literature.\nThey are obtained by modifying the standard proofs for the complete case or by considering the algebra's\ncompletion. Accordingly we begin by recalling the definition of this.\nDEFINITION A2.1: Let A be a normed algebra. Then a completion of A is a pair (\u00c3, i) where \u00c3 is a Banach\nalgebra and i is an isometric monomorphism A \u2192 \u00c3 with dense image.\nThere is a well known construction for normed spaces. One defines \u00c3 := S/ \u223c where S = {s \u2208\nAN : s is a Cauchy sequence } and \u223c is the equivalence relation on S given by\ns \u223c s\u2032\n\n:\u21d4\n\nlim ksn \u2212 s\u2032n k = 0\n\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nwhere s = (sn ), s\u2032 = (s\u2032n )\n\nIt is standard that completions are unique up to isometric isomorphism. By this we mean that if (B, j) is\nanother completion then there is an isometric isomorphism \u03c6: \u00c3 \u2192 B such that the following is commutative:\n\u03c6\n\n\u00c3 \u2212\u2192 B\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6i \u0580j\n\nA\n\nFor a, b \u2208 S (a = (an ), b = (bn )), \u03bb \u2208 C the normed space structure is given by\n[(an )] + [(bn )] := [(an + bn )]\n\u03bb[(an )] := [(\u03bban )]\nk[(an )]k := limn\u2192+\u221e kan k\nIt is a standard exercise to check that\n[(an )][(bn )] := [(an bn )]\nproperly defines a multiplication on \u00c3 in such a way that i is an algebra homomorphism. It is also clear\nthat normed algebra completions are unique to isometric isomorphism. They are clearly commutative if A\nis commutative. If A is unital then so is \u00c3 and i is too (i.e. 1\u00c3 = i(1A )).\nIn the rest of this appendix A will denote a complex normed algebra, not necessarily commutative or unital.\nAlthough the applications in the dissertation are only to unital algebras it is not much more difficult to\ndevelop the Gelfand theory for non-unital normed algebras. There is an existing theory for non-unital\nBanach algebras (see for example [20] chapter 1) in which the maximal ideals are replaced by the modular\nmaximal ideals.\nDEFINITION A2.2: Let R be a commutative algebra and J be a maximal ideal of R. J is called modular if\nfor some u \u2208 J we have \u2200 r \u2208 R r \u2212 ru \u2208 J.\nClearly all ideals are modular if R has a unity.\n39\n\n\fWhen A is not complete it is no longer automatic that a complex homomorphism is continuous. We therefore\nonly consider the continuous characters on A:\n\u03a9(A) := {\u03c9 \u2208 HomC (A, C): \u03c9 is continuous, \u03c9 6= 0}\nIn this way \u03a9(A) \u2286 A\u2217 and we can again exploit the topology on A\u2217 .\nLEMMA A2.3 (Gelfand-Mazur): Let A be a normed, unital division algebra. Then there exists an isometric\nisomorphism A \u2192 C.\nProof. This will be as for Banach algebras if we can show that again in normed algebras every a \u2208 A has\nnon-empty spectrum, \u03c3(a). This is the content of the Gelfand-Mazur theorem for Banach algebras. It can\nbe shown directly for normed algebras (for example in [2] p. 22 Theorem 5.6) but the following argument,\npointed out to me by Dr. Feinstein, avoids this. By the Banach algebra result \u03c3\u00c3 (a) 6= \u2205 where \u00c3 is as\nabove. But since there is a unital monomorphism A \u0592\u2192 \u00c3 we have \u03c3\u00c3 (a) \u2286 \u03c3A (a) so \u03c3(a) 6= \u2205 as required.\nOne comment is in order: if the normed algebra has a unity but is not unital (i.e. 1 < k1A k) then the\ntopological isomorphism of the theorem still exists but may not be isometric. (The map is A \u2192 C; a 7\u2192 \u03bba\nwhere \u03bba is the unique \u03bb \u2208 C: a = \u03bb1A .)\nLEMMA A2.4: Let A be a commutative normed algebra and let\nM (A) := {I \u2286 A: I is a closed, modular maximal ideal of A}.\nThen M (A) 6= \u2205 \u21d4 \u03a9(A) 6= \u2205 and in this case \u03bc: \u03a9(A) \u2192 M (A); \u03c9 7\u2192 ker \u03c9 is a bijection.\nProof. First suppose \u03a9(A) 6= \u2205. Let \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(A). Since \u03c9 6= 0 its kernel is a proper ideal of A. Suppose J is\nan ideal of A satisfying ker \u03c9 \u2282 J \u2282 A. Now \u03c9 is a ring epimorphism A \u2192 C so \u03c9(J) is an ideal of C. But\nC is simple so \u03c9(J) = {0} or C.\nIf \u03c9(J) = (0) then J \u2286 \u03c9 \u22121 (\u03c9(J)) = \u03c9 \u22121 ((0)) = ker \u03c9 which implies that ker \u03c9 = J, a contradiction.\nThe other case can't occur because if \u03c9(J) = C then 0 = C/\u03c9(J) \u223c\n= A/J (since \u03c9 is an epimorphism). But\nJ 6= A so A/J 6= 0, a contradiction.\nThus ker \u03c9 is maximal.\nker \u03c9 is closed by the continuity of \u03c9.\nLet a \u2208 A \u2212 ker \u03c9 and put u = a/\u03c9(a). Then we have that\n\u2200b \u2208 A\n\nb \u2212 ub \u2208 ker \u03c9\n\nand so ker \u03c9 is modular. Thus ker \u03c9 \u2208 M (A). Note that this also shows that \u03bc is well-defined and exists\nwhenever \u03a9(A) 6= \u2205. Also, the result that \u03bc is always injective when it exists does not require the completeness\nof A so we omit the detail (see for example [5] p. 321).\nSuppose now that M \u2208 M (A). Since A is commutative, A/M is a field; the unity is M + u where\nu \u2208 A: \u2200 a \u2208 A a \u2212 ua \u2208 M . By Lemma A2.3 there is a topological isomorphism \u03c6: A/M \u2192 C. The map\n\u03c9 := \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03bd where \u03bd is the natural epimorphism is therefore a continuous character of A. (It is standard that\nthe natural epimorphism of a normed space onto its quotient by a closed subspace is continuous.)\nWe have now shown M (A) 6= \u2205 \u21d4 \u03a9(A) 6= \u2205. It remains to check that when either set is non-empty, \u03bc\nis surjective. But for M \u2208 M (A), setting \u03c9 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03bd as described above gives a continuous character on A\nwith M \u2286 ker \u03c9. Since ker \u03c9 \u2282 A and M is maximal we have M = ker \u03c9 = \u03bc(\u03c9) as required.\nLEMMA A2.5: Let A be a normed algebra with \u03a9(A) non-empty. Every continuous character on A extends\nto a character on \u00c3.\nProof. Let \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(A). We must show that \u2203 \u03c9\u0303 \u2208 \u00c3 : \u03c9\u0303 \u25e6 i = \u03c9 where (\u00c3, i) is as above. But im i is dense in \u00c3,\n\u03c9 \u25e6 i\u22121 is a bounded linear map im i \u2192 C with norm k\u03c9k (where i\u22121 is the (induced) isometric isomorphism\nim i \u2192 A). C is complete so by the standard continuous linear extension theorem, \u2203| \u03c9\u0303 \u2208 B(\u00c3, C): \u03c9\u0303|im i = \u03c9.\nThis continuous extension is clearly also a unital homomorphism satisfying \u03c9\u0303 \u25e6 i = \u03c9.\n40\n\n\fAs for Banach algebras we define, when \u03a9(A) 6= \u2205, for a \u2208 A the map\nLet the set of these maps be \u00c2.\n\n\u00e2 : \u03a9(A) \u2192 C; \u03c9 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c9(a).\n\nLEMMA A2.6: Let A be a normed algebra with \u03a9(A) non-empty. Let \u03c4i be the initial topology on \u03a9(A)\ninduced by \u00c2. Then \u03a9(A) is a locally compact Hausdorff space and is compact if A is unital.\n\u2217\nProof. First we observe that \u03c4i = \u03c4\u03a9(A)\nwhere \u03c4 \u2217 is the weak *-topology on A\u2217 . This is because \u03c4i is the\ninitial topology induced by the restrictions to \u03a9(A) of the set of maps inducing the topology \u03c4 \u2217 (see [5]\nexercise 19-C).\nSo it is immediate that \u03a9(A) is Hausdorff, since \u03c4 \u2217 is known to be. Now let \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(A).\nBy Lemma A2.5, \u2203 \u03c9\u0303 \u2208 \u03a9(\u00c3): \u03c9\u0303 \u25e6 i. By the result for Banach algebras, \u03c9\u0303 \u2208 \u03a9(\u00c3) \u21d2 k\u03c9\u0303k \u2264 1. So\nk\u03c9k = k\u03c9\u0303 \u25e6 ik \u2264 k\u03c9\u0303kkik \u2264 1. Therefore \u03a9(A) \u2286 S \u2217 := BA\u2217 [0, 1]. By the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, S \u2217 is\n\u2217\ncompact with respect to \u03c4\u03a9(A)\n= \u03c4i . The rest of the proof (that \u03a9(A) \u222a {0} is closed in S \u2217 so that \u03a9(A) is\nlocally compact) is exactly the same as for Banach algebras (see for example [20] \u22171.3.5) so we omit this.\nCOROLLARY A2.7: \u2200 \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(A) k\u03c9k = 1.\nLEMMA A2.8: Let A be a normed algebra with \u03a9(A) non-empty. Then \u00c2 is a subalgebra of C0 (\u03a9(A))\nwhich separates the points of \u03a9(A) strongly.\nProof. Let \u0393: A \u2192 C0 (\u03a9(A)); a 7\u2192 \u00e2. It is clear that \u00c2 = im \u0393 separates the points of \u03a9(A) strongly: if\n\u03c91 , \u03c92 \u2208 \u03a9(A), \u03c91 6= \u03c92 \u21d2 \u2203a \u2208 A : \u03c91 (a) = \u00e2(\u03c91 ) 6= \u00e2(\u03c92 ) = \u03c92 (a). That \u00c2 vanishes at no point of \u03a9(A)\nis built into the definition of characters.\nThe verifications that \u0393 is a homomorphism and that \u2200 a \u2208 A \u00e2 is continuous and vanishes at infinity\nare the same as for Banach algebras so we omit the detail. Since \u00c2 = im \u0393, it is automatically an algebra.\nTo summarise our progress: we have established a norm decreasing homomorphism, \u0393, from the normed\nalgebra A into a C0 (X) for some locally compact Hausdorff space, and that in fact it is given in the same\nway as for Banach algebras but restricting attention to the continuous characters of A. We shall still call \u0393\nthe Gelfand transform. However it is now longer true that \u0393 is injective iff A is semisimple and the relevant\ncondition on A is given by the following definition, given in [1]:\nDEFINITION A2.9 ([1]): Let A be a normed unital algebra. A is called tractable if the intersection of its\nclosed maximal ideals is {0}.\n(Recall that the existence of the unit implies maximal ideals exist.) In fact by lemma A2.4 we can\ngeneralise (for commutative A at least) this to\nDEFINITION A2.10 Let A be a normed algebra. A is tractable if the intersection of its closed modular\nmaximal ideals, M (A), is {0}.\nThere is a definition of modular ideals for non-commutative normed algebras but we shall not refer to\nit. (The definition implies that M (A) is non-empty (unless A = 0) since the empty intersection of subsets\nof A is A itself.) It is consistent with the unital case because then every maximal ideal is modular with\n'modular unit' 1A . We have\nTHEOREM A2.11: Let A be a normed algebra for which \u03a9(A) 6= \u2205 and let \u0393 be the Gelfand transform.\nThen \u0393 is injective iff A is tractable.\nProof. By Lemma A2.4 there is a bijection \u03a9(A) \u2192 M (A); \u03c9 7\u2192 ker \u03c9. We have\nker \u0393 = {a \u2208 A: \u00e2 = 0 }\n\n= {a \u2208 A: \u2200 \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(A) \u03c9(a) = 0 }\n= \u2229\u03c9\u2208\u03a9(A) {a \u2208 A: \u03c9(a) = 0 }\n\n= \u2229\u03c9\u2208\u03a9(A) ker \u03c9\n\n= \u2229 M (A),\n\n41\n\n\fand the result follows.\nA result concerning tractability, which we state because it is needed in chapter 3, is:\nPROPOSITION A2.12: Let A be a commutative unital normed algebra and (\u00c3, i) a completion. Then if \u00c3\nis semisimple, A is tractable.\nT\nProof. Suppose \u00c3 is semisimple and that a \u2208 M (A). Let \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(\u00c3). Ti is a unital homomorphism so\n\u03c9 \u25e6 i \u2208 \u03a9(A). So by assumption (\u03c9 \u25e6 i)(a) = \u03c9(i(a)) = 0. Therefore i(a) \u2208 M (\u00c3) = (0). But i is injective\nso a = 0.\nThe converse to this is false; see chapter 3 for an example.\nDEFINITION A2.13: Let A be a normed algebra. K(A) := \u2229M (A) is the radical of A.\nThe last result of this section confirms the result asserted in [1] that factoring a normed algebra by ker \u0393\n(where it exists) gives a tractable normed algebra. We prove it in the commutative, unital case; it is applied\nin the proof of Theorem 2.13.\nPROPOSITION A2.14: Let A be a commutative unital normed algebra and M (A) be as above. Then\nA/K(A) is a tractable normed algebra.\nProof. By the fundamental isomorphism theorem, \u0393 induces an isomorphism \u0393\u0303: A/K(A) \u2192 \u00c2 with norm\nk\u0393k. Now \u00c2 \u2286 C(\u03a9(A)) and we have the evaluation characters\n\u03b5\u03c9 : \u00c2 \u2192 C; f 7\u2192 f (\u03c9)\n\n(\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(A))\n\nIt follows that \u00c2 is tractable because if f \u2208 K(\u00c2) then \u2200 \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(A) \u03b5\u03c9 (f ) = f (\u03c9) = 0 so f = 0.\nNow \u0393\u0303 is an algebraic isomorphism so it induces a bijection between the maximal ideals of A/K(A) and\n\u00c2 given by J 7\u2192 \u0393\u0303(J). \u0393\u0303 is continuous so for every closed maximal ideal, J, of \u00c2, \u0393\u0303\u22121 (J) is a closed maximal\nideal of A/K(A).

All the results in this chapter are well known and we shall omit all\nproofs of the more standard ones; we refer the reader to [21] for these.\nDEFINITION A3.1: Let (W, \u2264) be a well-ordered set and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 W with \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2.

By A3.19.16 there certainly exist uncountable ordinals. By A3.12\nthere is a unique first uncountable ordinal, which we denote \u03c91 . It is easy to see that \u03c91 has the desired\nproperty. The sort of situation in which it becomes useful is illustrated by the result below (which is also\nused in chapter 6).\nTHEOREM A3.20: Let (X, d) be aSmetric space and (F\u03b1 )0\u2264\u03b1<\u03c91 be a family of closed sets in X such that\n\u2200 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03c91 F\u03b1 \u2286 F\u03b2 .

Now \u2200 n \u2208 N \u2203 \u03b1n < \u03c91 : xn \u2208 F\u03b1n .\nNow S\n\u2203 \u03b1 < \u03c91 : \u2200 n \u2208 N \u03b1n \u2264 \u03b1 for if this were not true then \u2200 \u03b1 < \u03c91 \u2203 n \u2208 N : \u03b1 < \u03b1n . Hence\n[0, \u03c91 ) \u2286 n\u2208N [0, \u03b1n ). But by the definition of \u03c91 , [0, \u03b1n ) is countable \u2200 n \u2208 N . Therefore \u03c91 = [0, \u03c91 ) is\ncountable since it is contained in a countable union of countable sets.
