Here, we report a new method to\nstrongly improve the opti al readout \u001cdelity of ele tron spin states asso iated with single nitrogenva an y (NV) enters in diamond. The signal-to-noise ratio is enhan ed signi\u001c antly by performing\nonditional \u001dip-\u001dop pro esses between the ele tron spin and the nu lear spin of the NV enter\u0001s\nnitrogen atom. The enhan ed readout pro edure is triggered by a short preparatory pulse sequen e.\nAs the nitrogen nu lear spin is intrinsi ally present in the system, this method is universally appliable to any nitrogen-va an y enter.\nPACS numbers:\n\nThe negatively harged nitrogen-va an y (NV) enter in diamond exhibits numerous outstanding properties whi h make it a promising andidate for novel appli ations in quantum and imaging s ien e. Impressive\nexperiments have demonstrated its potential as a solidstate qubit at room temperature [1, 2, 3\u2104, for nanos ale\nmagnetometry [4, 5, 6\u2104 and for probing spin dynami s\nat nanos ale [7, 8\u2104. The oheren e times of its ele tron\nspin are the longest reported for any solid-state system\nat room-temperature [9, 10\u2104. The use of nearby single\nnu lear spins as additional resour e for quantum information [11\u2104 allows a variety of appli ations, from onditional quantum gates [12\u2104 and storage of quantum information to realization of small quantum registers and\nmulti-partite entanglement [13, 14\u2104. In all these experiments, the quantum information stored in the spin system is read out opti ally by re ording spin-state dependent \u001duores en e rates of the NV enter [15, 16\u2104. Even\nsingle nu lear spin qubits an be read out via the NV enter by oherent mapping of the nu lear spin state onto the\nele tron spin [12\u2104. Therefore, the overall readout \u001cdelity\nof any appli ation is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio\nof the opti al readout pro ess of the NV enter. Very\nre ently signi\u001c ant \u001cdelity enhan ement was a hieved by\nmapping the ele tron spin state onto 13 C nu lear spins\nand repetitive readout [17\u2104.\nIn this Letter, we report a novel and universal method\nto enhan e the signal-to-noise ratio of the opti al readout\npro ess of NV enter spins. To this end we exploit the\nspin dynami s of the intrinsi nitrogen nu lear spin that\nrely on a level-anti rossing (LAC) in the NV enter\u0001s exited state [18, 19, 20\u2104 to obtain a threefold enhan ement\nin signal per readout step. This speeds up the data a quisition pro ess by a fa tor of 3 and orresponds to\u221aan\nin rease of the signal-to-noise ratio by a fa tor of 3.\nAs the method ex lusively utilizes intera tions with the\nintrinsi nitrogen nu leus, its feasibility does not depend\non the presen e of further an illa spins.\nThe NV enter onsists of a substitutional nitrogen\natom and an adja ent va an y (see Fig. 1(b)).

Hen e, the average \u001duores en e\nintensity depends on the spin state. ISC o urs mainly\nfrom the mS =\u00b11 (|\u00b11i) levels whi h therefore onstitute\n\"dark states\", whereas the mS =0 (|0i) level onstitutes\na \"bright state\" with a higher average \u001duores en e intensity. ISC from the singlet state ba k to the ground state\npreferentially ends up in |0i, leading to a strong polarization of the ele tron spin under opti al ex itation [23\u2104.\nThe ground state spin triplet represents the logi qubit\nor the magneti sensor. It is initialized to |0i by a nonresonant laserpulse (532 nm). The operating transition\nused in this Letter is the transition between |0i and |\u22121i\n(see Fig. 2(a)). Unitary qubit ontrol or magneti sensing is performed by ommon mi rowave pulse te hniques\nunder dark onditions. The output of the operation enoded in the spin state is read out opti ally by appli ation\nof a readout laserpulse and dete tion of the \u001duores en e\nresponse. Fig. 2(a) shows the a umulated number of response photons per ns n|0i(|\u22121i) (t) upon a readout laserpulse for the observed NV enter initially being in spin\nstate |0i (|\u22121i). If the initial spin state is |0i, the pulse\nshows a high initial \u001duores en e level whi h de ays towards a steady-state value with non-zero population in\nthe singlet state due to a small probability for ISC from\n|0i. For |\u22121i, the initial \u001duores en e de ays fast towards\na low level due to a high ISC rate to the singlet state.\nAs the singlet state always de ays to spin state |0i in the\nground state [16\u2104, the low \u001duores en e level de ays to the\nsteady-state value within the lifetime of the singlet state\nof about 250 ns.\nThe signal used to dis riminate the spin states is the\ndi\u001beren e in the number of photons olle ted during the\nreadout laserpulse (see grey area in Fig. 2(a)). Note that\nfor spin state |\u22121i, the system passes on e through the\nsinglet state before being polarized. After polarization,\nall information about the initial spin state is destroyed\nand the system is in its steady state |0i. Hen e, the signal\nper readout pulse is limited by the opti al polarization\nrate of the ele tron spin whi h is given by the lifetime\nof the singlet state (\u03c4 \u2248 250 ns) and is on the order of\n4 MHz. If \u001duores en e photons ould be dete ted at a\nhigher rate than 4 MHz, single passages through the singlet state ould be observed as ompletely dark intervals\nin the \u001duores en e signal. However, as urrently a hievable photon ountrates (\u2248 300 kHz at room temperature)\nare far below this threshold, readout has to be performed\nby repetitive a umulation of \u001duores en e signal with a\non omitant in rease in measurement time.\nWe now demonstrate a method to de rease the measurement time (in rease the number of signal photons per\nshot) for the spin state of single NV enters by a fa tor\nof 3 by exploiting the spin dynami s of the 14 N nitrogen\nnu lear spin (I=1).

However, due to strong hyper\u001cne oupling\nbetween ele tron and nitrogen nu lear spin in the exited state (\u2248 20 times stronger than in the ground state\n[19\u2104), there is LAC between spin states |0, 0i and |\u22121, +1i\nresp. |0, \u22121i and |\u22121, 0i, asso iated with strong spin mix-\n\nB\n\n\f3\n\n(a) |-1,0\u3009\nrf\n(trigger)\n\n|-1,+1\u3009\n\n|-1,-1\u3009\nmw\n(operating\ntransition)\n\n|0,0\u3009\n|0,+1\u3009\n\n|0,-1\u3009\n|0,+1\u3009\n\nIPL [a.u.]\n\nbright\n\n|-1,-1\u3009\n\ndark\n0\n\n|0,-1\u3009\n\n|0,0\u3009\n\n|-1,0\u3009\n\n|-1,+1\u3009\n\nlaserpulse duration [a.u.]\n\n(b) 3\n# photons [1000/ns]\n\ning (see Fig.2( )).

These are\nnot possible for spin states |0, +1i and |\u22121, \u22121i whi h\ntherefore are not a\u001be ted by mixing. Under opti al illumination, the ele tron spin is steadily polarized into |0i.\nThus, the only stable spin state is |0, +1i. As a result,\nopti al illumination leads to strong polarization of the\nsystem into |0, +1i at B\u2248500G (see spe tra in Fig. 2(b)).\nIf the system is now prepared in spin state |\u22121, \u22121i before appli ation of the readout laserpulse, it has to pass\nthree times through the singlet state instead of one in\na as ade-like pro ess before rea hing the bright steady\nstate |0, +1i. As ea h passage through the singlet state\nyields the same amount of signal as obtained by onventional readout, the total signal is tripled.\nThe detailed pro ess o uring upon appli ation of a\nreadout laserpulse is illustrated in Fig. 3(a). Starting\nfrom spin state |\u22121, \u22121i, the system on e passes through\nthe singlet state as the ele tron spin is polarized. This\npro ess yields the signal (grey area in Fig. 3(a)) obtained equivalently by onventional readout. The passage through the singlet state (grey arrows with dots in\nFig. 3(a)) is assumed to onserve the nu lear spin state,\nhen e the system ends up in |0, \u22121i. The system is now\nrepumped to the ex ited state by the same readout laserpulse. There it has a ertain probability to perform the\n\u001dip-\u001dop pro ess |0, \u22121i \u2194 |\u22121, 0i due to the strong mixing between these two spin states (see Fig.2( )). Thus, it\nhas the two possibilities of either performing an opti al\ny le under emission of a \u001duores en e photon or performing an ele tron-nu lear \u001dip-\u001dop pro ess. As opti al y les\nare spin- onserving, a \u001dip-\u001dop pro ess will \u001cnally o ur\nand the system will be in |\u22121, 0i. From there, it will pass\na se ond time through the singlet state, additionally giving rise to the same amount of signal as before (blue area\nin Fig. 3(a)). After the se ond relaxation via ISC, the\nsystem will be in state |0, 0i. It will now again be reexited, where the spin states |0, 0i and |\u22121, +1i are mixed.\nAs before, the system will inevitably perform a spin \u001dip\u001dop with subsequent passage through the singlet state,\nagain yielding additional signal. After this third ISCrelaxation, the system will be in the bright steady state\n|0, +1i, whi h yields a onstant level of \u001duores en e intensity.\nThe \u001duores en e responses n|mS ,mI i (t) for onventional (grey tra e) and enhan ed readout (blue tra e) are\nompared in Fig. 3(b). The lower tra es show the di\u001beren e in \u001duores en e between bright and dark state for\nboth ases. The olored areas represent the amount of\nsignal photons and show the expe ted threefold enhan ement.\nThe amount of signal photons saturates with in reasing\npulse duration while the noise arising from the poissonian\ndistribution of olle ted photons (shot noise) grows approximately as the squareroot of the pulselength.

Thus, the maximum SN R is enhan ed by 3 (see Fig.\n4(b)) and shifted to a longer pulselength. Fig. 4(a) shows\nele tron Rabi os illations re orded with onventional and\nenhan ed readout. The experimental results exhibit the\nbehaviour predi ted by our model.\nIn pra ti e, enhan ed readout is implemented as follows: After exe ution of a desired pulse sequen e on the\noperating transition |0, +1i \u2194 |\u22121, +1i (see arrow in Fig.\n3(a)), two onse utive resonant radiofrequen y \u03c0 -pulses\non the nu lear spin transitions |\u22121, +1i \u2194 |\u22121, 0i and\n|\u22121, 0i \u2194 |\u22121, \u22121i (see orange arrows in Fig. 3(a)) are\napplied right before appli ation of the readout laserpulse.\nNu lear spin transitions an be driven sele tively up to\nRabi frequen ies on the order of MHz. Thus, the time required to trigger the enhan ed readout is on the order of\na few \u03bcs. At B=500G, the optimum pulselength for the\nenhan ed \u001duores en e response is extended by about 500\nns. Hen e, the enhan ed readout method already pays if\nthe length of the omplete pulse sequen e is on the order\nof a few \u03bcs, whi h is ful\u001clled in most ases.\nThe most riti al parameter of enhan ed readout is the\nangle between magneti \u001celd and the NV axis [20\u2104. The\nmagneti \u001celd an be varied over a wide range (\u00b1200G)\nwithout losing the polarization e\u001be t (see [20\u2104). However, as the \u001dip-\u001dop probability de reases with distan e\nfrom the LAC (see inset in Fig. 2( )), the signal formation pro ess is slowed down whi h leads to de rease of\nthe maximum SN R. At 50G from the LAC, the SN R\nenhan ement is about half the maximum value.\nThe method has been demonstrated for NV enters\nontaining a 14 N atom (I=1), however, it works analo-\n\n\f5\nADDITIONAL MATERIAL\n\nIn this additional online material we explain the spin\nHamiltonian and the important intera tions in more detail.

The\nthird term is the hyper\u001cne intera tion between NV enter's ele tron spin and the nu lear spin of its 14 N atom.\nAs the ele tron spin the nu lear spin is a triplet I = 1. It\nleads to a splitting of \u2248 2.2 MHz. For simpli ity we assume an isotropi hyper\u001cne intera tion whi h is su\u001e ient\nto explain the spe tra in the paper. Finally, the fourth\nand \u001cfth term des ribe the energies of the nu lear spin\nwith its quadrupole splitting Q and its nu lear Zeeman\nenergy where gn is the 14 N nu lear spin g-fa tor and\n\u03bcn the nu lear magneti moment. In this Hamiltonian\nthe magneti \u001celd is assumed parallel to the NV-axis (zdire tion) as was the ase in the performed experiments.\nThe resulting ele tron spin energy levels as a fun tion\nof the magneti \u001celd are displayed in Fig. 1(a) of the\nmain paper and their nu lear spin sublevels are depi ted\nin Fig. 1( ). The ele tron spin transition between states\n|0 i and |\u22121 i for two magneti \u001celd strengths is shown in\n\u001cg. 2(b) of the main paper. In the lower spe trum the\nhyper\u001cne splitting is visible. It is absent in the upper\nspe trum be ause the nu lear spin is polarized in state\nmI = +1.\nThe ex ited state Hamiltonian basi ally looks the\nsame. Only the onstants hange. The zero \u001celd splitting be omes Des = 1420 MHz [1, 2\u2104, and the hyper\u001cne\nsplitting is Aes \u2248 40 MHz (see Fig. 5). Again we assume\nan isotropi hyper\u001cne intera tion. The fa t that the polarization me hanism for the nu lear spin mentioned in\nthe paper works well underlines that there must be substantial o\u001b-diagonal terms in the hyper\u001cne intera tion of\nthe ex ited state.\nIn Fig. 2( ) of the main paper, the al ulated eigenvalues of the ex ited state Hamiltonian in the basis |\u22121, \u22121i,\n|\u22121, 0i, |\u22121, +1i, |0, \u22121i, |0, 0i and |0, +1i are drawn as a\nfun tion of the magneti \u001celd amplitude.

The hyper\u001cne intera tion in the ex ited state\nis roughly 20 times larger than in the ground state. The width\nof the lines originates from the short ex ited state lifetime of\nabout 10 ns.\n\nfrom the oe\u001e ients of the basis states parti ipating in a\n\u001dip-\u001dop pro ess (see [3\u2104 for details).\n\nnu lear spin manipulation\n\nFor the enhan ed readout te hnique, the nu lear spin\nhas to be manipulated. Therefore, \u001crst of all the nu lear\ntransition frequen ies in ele tron spin state |0 i and\n|\u22121 i have to be obtained. This is done by a ombined\npulsed and w te hnique whi h is sket hed in Fig. S6(a).\nThe signal gained in this experiment already uses the\nenhan ement te hnique.\nAt \u001crst a magneti \u001celd of 500 Gauss is applied\nparallel to the NV axis (z dire tion) as in the paper. A\nlaser pulse initializes the system into |mS , mI i = |0, +1 i.\nA subsequent mi rowave (mw) \u03c0 pulse (not ne essary for\noperation in |0 i) onverts it into |\u22121(0 ), +1 i. In a next\nstep a radiofrequen y (rf) \u03c0 pulse resonant on transition\n|\u22121(0 ), +1 i \u2194 |\u22121(0 ), 0 i yields state |\u22121(0 ), 0 i. Out of\nthis starting state a rf \u03c0 pulse with sweeping frequen y\nis applied. Finally population in |\u22121(0 ), 0 i is onverted\nba k to |0, +1 i whi h is the only bright state. The\npopulation here is read out by a \u001cnal laser pulse whi h\nis in fa t the \u001crst laser pulse of the next run. This\nsequen e is ontinuously repeated while the frequen y\nof the sweeping pulse is hanged and the orresponding\n\u001duores en e is re orded. If the swept frequen y hits\nthe resonan e for transitions |\u22121(0 ), 0 i \u2194 |\u22121(0 ), +1 i\nor |\u22121(0 ), 0 i \u2194 |\u22121(0 ), \u22121 i no population ends up\nin bright state |0, +1 i. It is then either in |0, 0 i or in\n|0, \u22121 i.
