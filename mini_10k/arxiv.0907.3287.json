Evolutionary game\ntheory [2, 3] - a research field cultivated traditionally by both evolutionary biologists, political scientists,\neconomists and mathematician [4, 5] that recently has\nattracted a growing interest from the physics community [6, 7] - provides a general framework to address\nsuch issues. One famous metaphor for the problem of cooperation is the prisoner's dilemma (PD) game [8, 9], in\nwhich defection could benefit the individual in the short\nterm, whereas cooperation has only potential benefits in\na longer time perspective. In the common mathematical formulation of PD with pairwise interaction, each of\ntwo encountering cooperators (defectors) get a payoff R\n(P ), a defector confronting a cooperator acquires payoff\nT , while the cooperator gains S. The four parameters is\nrequired to satisfy the conditions T > R > P > S and\n2R > T + S. In a well-mixed population, defectors are\nunbeatable and cooperators are doomed to extinction [4].\nThe seminal work of Nowak and May [10], where a\nPD game is played on two-dimensional grids with agents\nlacking memory and ability to form complex strategies,\nshowed that spatial structure and nearest neighbor interactions can enable cooperators to survive by forming clusters within which they benefit from mutual cooperation\nand protecting them from exploitation by defectors. This\n\n\u2217 zhi-xi.wu@physics.umu.se\n\u2020 petter.holme@physics.umu.se\n\nwork has inspired numerous subsequent investigations of\nevolutionary games on spatial grids [11, 12]. Now the spatial (or network) reciprocity is regarded as one of the five\nmain mechanisms supporting cooperation [5, 14]. Furthermore, coevolution of strategy distribution and underlying interaction graphs can also be useful in characterizing the PD game [15, 16, 17, 18]. The crucial observation\nis that through switching partners, cooperators are capable of frequently meeting other cooperators, which substantially increase their reproduction rate. In addition, a\nlots of other mechanisms favoring cooperation have also\nbeen proposed: volunteering participation [19], separation of interaction and learning graphs [20], dilution and\nrandom diffusion of agents on the grid [21], success-driven\nmigration [22], memory effects [23], reputation-based interaction [24], moderate aspiration level [25], etc. For a\ncomprehensive review of this research field, we refer to\nRefs. [5, 6].\nIt is worth pointing out that the scale-free topology,\nthanks to the capability of mutual protection of the hubs\nif occupied by cooperators, can enhance the spreading of\ncooperative behavior and resist the invasion of defection,\nhence becoming a promoter of cooperation [13]. However, it was also argued that the adoption of averaged\npayoffs instead of accumulated ones in the score function, as well as an introduction of participation costs,\nmight weaken this mechanism [26]. These results suggest\nthat the distinct ability of strategy breeding of the players [27], rather than the interaction graph, matters much\nfor the emergence of cooperation. The heterogeneous\nor asymmetric strategy migration ability can be implemented in different ways, such as dynamic preferential\nselection [28], introduction of two types of players with\ndifferent teaching activity [29], social diversity [30, 31],\nnonlinear attractive effect [32, 33], etc. In principle, as\n\n\f2\nlong as some distinguished players have higher influence\nto spread their strategy [31], and also the connections\namong these influential players are coupled in some appropriate way [27, 29, 30], the dilemma can be relaxed\nand the promotion of cooperation is warranted.\nThese results suggest that the heterogeneity in the migration of strategies might be an important factor for\nthe stability of cooperation. To our knowledge, in most\nprevious studies of spatial games, a common simplifying\nassumption is that, whenever updating strategy, a player\nselects a neighbor as reference and attempts to adopt\nthe neighbor's strategy according to some prescribed criterion. In other words, the focal player is always a recipient of the strategy. Only few works have studied the reverse situation, with strategy donors and their influence\non the evolution of cooperation. Ohtsuki et al. implemented both death-birth and birth-death updating for\ngames on graphs, and found that for birth-death updating, selection does not favor cooperation [34]. Antal et al.\nstudied evolutionary dynamics on degree-heterogeneous\ngraphs, evolved either by one individual dying and being\nreplaced by the offspring of a random neighbor (voter\nmodel dynamics) or by an individual giving birth to an\noffspring taking over a random neighbor (invasion process dynamics). They found that the fixation probability\nof a single fitter mutant under the voter model dynamics\nis k 2 times of corresponding value for the invasion process\ndynamics (k is the node degree) [35]. With this paper,\nwe continue investigating the effects of the direction of\nstrategy migration on the evolution of cooperation in the\nspatially explicit PD game. Another theme of recent research is the effects of noise on dynamic processes [36].\nIndeed, noise (or mutation) plays an important role in\nthe outcome of evolutionary games [37, 38]. In recent\nyears, the effects of noise on spatial games have also been\nstudied [39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. The spatial PD model proposed in [10] is a deterministic cellular automaton and\ncan be extended to a stochastic version by introduction\nof noise in different ways. Perhaps the first spatial PD\nmodel with a stochastic strategy adoption process was\nproposed in Ref. [44]. We take the approach of Szab\u00f3\nand T\u0151ke [39], where the players updates their strategies\naccording to a Fermi function and in which noise have the\nrole of temperature in the kinetic Ising model. For this\nsimple \"noise-guided\" evolutionary model, the authors\nfound rich dynamic phenomena - two absorbing states\nconsisting of only cooperators and defectors separated\nby a coexistence region. Particularly, the phase transition involving the extinction of cooperators or defectors is\nfound to belong to the universality class of directed percolation [39]. In a similar vein, they also studied how the\nnoise affects the phase diagram of PD on different twodimensional lattices and Newman\u2013Watts networks [40].\nIn somewhat different approach, Perc et al. and Tanimoto\nintroduced noise to the payoff matrix [43, 45]. The reported results show a coherence-resonance phenomenon\nwhere the fraction of cooperators reaches its maximum\nat an intermediate noise level [43]. In Ref. [40] the noise\n\neffect in PD games was studied, mainly focusing on the\nthreshold of extinction of cooperation as a function of\nnoise intensity. A clear picture for how the average fraction of cooperation evolves by varying the noise level under different intensities of the temptation to defection, to\nthe best of our knowledge, is still lacking. In the present\nwork, we will follow the research line of Refs. [34, 35, 40]\nto study how the strategy migration direction and selection noise affect the cooperation. In the rest of the\npaper, we first define our model and then treat the problems sketched above both by computer simulations and\ncluster approximation methods. Finally, we make some\ndiscussions and draw our conclusion.\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nIn the present study, we consider the evolutionary PD\non three types of regular lattices with periodic boundary conditions, namely square lattice with von Neumann\nneighborhood (von Neumann lattice), square lattice with\nMoore neighborhood (Moore lattice), and kagome lattice,\nsuch that the number of encounters of each player are\nfour, eight, and six, respectively. The reason we concentrate on these simple lattices is twofold: first, previous\nstudies have found that local interaction does affect the\nspreading of cooperation [12, 40]; second, their regular\nstructures allow us to implement mean-field cluster approximation analysis [6, 7, 40].\nFollowing many studies [6, 31, 39, 40], we use the\nNowak\u2013May parameterization [10] of the spatial PD, i.e.,\nthe temptation to defect T = b (where 1 < b < 2), the\nreward for mutual cooperation R = 1, the punishment of\nmutual defection P = 0, and the sucker's payoff S = 0.\nInitially, we let the players be either unconditional cooperators (C) or defectors (D) with equal probability. The\nevolution of strategies is governed by random sequential\nupdating. For each of the considered lattice topologies,\nwe first let a randomly chosen player i reap its payoff\nPi by playing the PD game with its nearest neighbors.\nThen, we select a random neighbor j of i, and let it acquire its payoff Pj by playing the game with its nearest\nneighbors.\nWhen updating strategy, the focal player i can be of\nthe role of either strategy donor or strategy-recipient. If\ni is the strategy-recipient, we implement a voter-modellike dynamics (VMLD) [35], which is probably the most\ncommon approach [6, 13, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 39, 40, 41,\n42, 43]. In this case, the player i imitates the strategy of\nj with a probability dependent on their payoff difference\n[39]\nWij =\n\n1\n,\n1 + exp [(Pi \u2212 Pj )/\u03ba]\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03ba \u2208 [0, \u221e) denotes the noise level (or, in the language of evolutionary biology, selection intensity [14]).\nIn the \u03ba = 0 limit, the adoption of a successful strategy\nis deterministic, while in the \u03ba \u2192 \u221e limit, the strategy\n\n\f3\nlearning is blind [40]. If, however, we treat the player\ni as the strategy donor, we implement exactly invasionprocess-like dynamics (IPLD) for the game [35]. In this\ncase, the neighbor j will try to take the focal player i's\nstrategy with a probability defined as\n\nIPLD on von Neumann\nVMLD on Moore\nIPLD on Moore\n\n0.6\n\nVMLD on kagome\n\nc\n\n(2)\n\nIPLD on kagome\n\nf\n\n1\nWji =\n.\n1 + exp [(Pj \u2212 Pi )/\u03ba]\n\nVMLD on von Neumann\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n= 0.3\n\n0.2\n\n(a)\n\n1.04\n0.8\n\n1.08\n\n1.12\n\n1.16\n\n1.20\n\n1.24\n\nFour-site approximation on von Neumann\nFive-site approximation on kagome\n\nc\n\n0.6\n\nf\n\nBy tuning the values of b and \u03ba in the framework of the\ntwo updating schemes, we can obtain pictures of how the\nnoise intensity and direction of strategy migration impact\nthe final outcome of the evolutionary spatial PD game.\nIn our simulation, we consider the possible strategymigration for the players one by one according to a random sequence. One pass through all the agents is called\na Monte Carlo (MC) sweep. Between each MC sweep we\nreshuffle the sampling sequence. The total population is\nof size 200 \u00d7 200 for the von Neumann and Moore lattices, and 3 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 100 for the kagome lattice. When\nrepeating the above described elementary steps the system develops into a final stationary state characterized\nby the average fraction of cooperators fc , which is measured for the last 3000 sweeps of the total 2\u00d7104 . All the\nsimulation results presented below are averages over 20\nindependent realizations of initial strategy distribution.\n\n0.4\n= 0.3\n0.2\n\n(b)\n\n1.05\n\n1.10\n\n1.15\n\n1.20\n\n1.25\n\n1.30\n\n1.35\n\n1.40\n\nb\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe start by comparing the results from the game with\nthe VMLD strategy-updating rule with the corresponding IPLD results. In Fig. 1(a), we present the simulation results for fc as a function of the temptation to\ndefect b on the three lattices, and the noise level \u03ba is\nfixed as 0.3. We note that fc decreases monotonously\nwith increasing b up to a threshold bc , where cooperation vanishes. Although the qualitative properties of the\ncurves are somewhat similar, there exist quantitative differences. By comparison, the stationary cooperation level\nin IPLD is lower than the corresponding value for VMLD.\nFurthermore, IPLD results in a lower bc -threshold. Thus,\nour first finding is that VMLD is more favorable for the\nspreading of cooperation than IPLD.\nAt a first glance, it may seem strange that VMLD and\nIPLD on homogeneous graph give rise to different results, since what is regarded as VMLD from the point\nof view of the strategy-recipient is exactly the IPLD in\nthe viewpoint of the strategy donor. (On heterogeneous\ngraph, this difference is evident, since high-degree individuals have greater chance to affect others for VMLD,\nand to be affected by others for IPLD.) In fact, the fouror five-site cluster approximation, developed in the spirit\nof mean-field theory [6], do not differentiate between the\nVMLD and IPLD, and give out exactly the same results\nfor both strategy updating dynamics (see Fig. 1(b), the\ntwo curves for the VMLD and IPLD coincide with one another, and for simplicity we just show one). A crucial observation is that this method neglects spatial correlations\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Average fraction fc of cooperation as a function of the temptation to defect b for a fixed\nnoise intensity \u03ba = 0.3 on three types of lattices. Solid and\nopen symbols correspond to the two strategy-migration dynamics VMLD and IPLD, respectively. (b) Theoretical estimations by the four-site cluster approximation on the von\nNeumann lattice, and by the five-site cluster approximation\non the kagome lattice, correctly predict the evolving tendency\nof fc , but do not differentiate between VMLD and IPLD dynamics. Note the different scaling of the x-axis in the two\npanels.\n\nin the population, which cause the update probabilities\nof VMLD and IPLD to differ. Indeed, if the two probabilities are the same, the final results will be identical\non homogeneous graphs. This argument can be deduced\nfrom the studies of voter model on graphs. In Ref. [47],\nCastellano studied both voter and anti-voter dynamics\non networks (corresponding to the VMLD and IPLD in\nthis work), and found that on homogeneous network, the\nconsensus time in both dynamics is the same. In [35],\nAntal et al. pointed out that the fixation probability of a\nneutral genotype on homogeneous graph is the same for\nboth voter-model and invasion-process dynamics. The\nessential difference between the voter model and evolutionary games is that in voter model, when a randomly\nselected individual is to update its state, only the state of\nthe selected neighbor matters, while in the PD game case,\nboth the state of the selected neighbor and those of this\nneighbor's neighbors.

A\ndefector at a rough boundary would have, on average,\ngreater chance to be convinced by its cooperating neighbors in the VMLD picture, than a cooperating neighbor\nto convince a defector in the IPLD. To test this point,\nwe have traced the time series of NC /ND , the number of\nevents of D switching to C divided by the reverse case,\nfor two special values of b on the von Neumann lattice.\nThe results presented in Fig. 2 give further evidence for\nthe above speculation.\nBefore moving forward, we briefly comment the importance of the network structures in maintaining cooperation. In previous studies [40] the overlapping triangles (especially, one-site overlapping triangles) in the\nconnectivity structure are found to support the spreading\n(maintenance) of cooperation. Here, we want to point\nout that this conclusion is drawn in terms of the magnitude of bc for the evolutionary PD on different lattice structures [40]. Looking back on our simulations\nin Fig. 1, we believe that this is not the whole story.\nIf we measure the capability of promoting cooperation\nby the average fraction of cooperation in the equilibrium\nstate, we observe that when b is small (e.g. b = 1.1), the\none-site overlapping triangles (the kagome lattice) is an\ninferior structure compared to the case of multiple overlapping sites (the Moore lattice). This indicates that the\ntemptation parameter is an indicative variable when evaluating the role of connectivity structure, giving a more\nnuanced picture than the previously mentioned effect of\noverlapping triangles in Ref. [40].\n\nVMLD\n\nb=1.04\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2.0\n\nFIG. 3: Average fraction fc of cooperation as a function of\nthe noise parameter \u03ba for fixed values of b on (a) the von\nNeumann lattice, (b) the Moore lattice, and (c) the kagome\nlattice.

As mentioned\nabove, the extinction threshold of cooperation bc as a\nfunction of \u03ba on different types of lattices has been studied in [29, 40]. Here we investigate how \u03ba influences fc in\nthe stationary state for different values of b. In Fig. 3(a),\nwe show simulation results of fc versus \u03ba for two values of\nb = 1.02, b = 1.045 on the von Neumann lattice.

The arrows mark\nthe places where fc maximizes when b = 1.12.\n\n\u03ba. If, in this case, the noise is too weak or strong cooperation may be extinct (this is in accordance with previous\nresults [43]). For the parameters used, the maximum\nfc emerges at about \u03ba = 0.3. We note that for the same\ntemptation to defect, comparing with the case of VMLD,\nIPLD results in a narrower region of \u03ba, where cooperators can maintain a non-zero fraction in the population.\nThat is to say, cooperation is more robust against the\nfluctuation of noise in the case of VMLD. This result\nstrengthens our previous finding from Fig. 1. Note that\nlim\u03ba\u2192\u221e fc = 1/2. In this paper we focus on low noise\nlevels, i.e. situations where the competitive interactions\ndominate the dynamics and do not study how cooperation reemerges for very large \u03ba.\nThe observed resonant behavior can be understood as\nfollows. As mentioned above, the noise parameter \u03ba measures the stochastic uncertainties in the process of strategy learning. In the limit of weak noise, the irrational\nchoices of the individuals become very rare. The strategies of those individuals who get higher payoffs would always migrate successfully. Though the payoffs of the defectors at the interface are on average smaller than those\nof cooperators [33], the highest payoff is always obtained\n\n\f6\n\n0.6\n\nkagome\nMoore\n\n0.5\n\n= 0.01\n0.4\n\nc\n\n0.3\n\nf\n\nby those defectors surrounded by three other cooperators. As such, if the individuals imitate with complete\nrationality (\u03ba \u2192 0), the defective strategy would spread\nmore easily in the population, which does harm to the\nformation of clusters of cooperators. On the other hand,\nin the limit of large noise, the payoff information becomes\nless important in determining the success of strategy migration. In such situation, it would be definitely inefficient for the cooperators at the interface to spread their\nbehavior (though they acquire higher payoff on average\nthan those defectors [33]). If, however, the noise \u03ba is\nappropriately chosen, i.e., not too large or too small, the\ncooperators would have more chance to diffusion, and the\ndefectors with highest payoff would have less probability\nto be followed by cooperators, leading to the surviving\nand enhancement of cooperation. Henceforth the optimal noisy intensity \u03ba emerges.\nThe experimental tests of the PD game on the Moore\nand kagome lattices display somewhat similar results\n(Figs. 3(b) and (c)). For an appropriate temptation to\ndefect, when varying \u03ba, we also notice an emergent of coherence resonance. Moreover, the VMLD is also found to\nbe superior to the IPLD in promoting cooperation. Despite these two aspects, when \u03ba is sufficiently small, the\nsimulation results illustrated in Fig. 3(a) are in stark contrast to those in Figs. 3(b) and (c). In the former case,\nthe cooperators are doomed to extinction in the limit of\nzero noise, whereas they can persist in the population\nwith finite fc in the latter two cases. We argue that the\npresence of overlapping triangles [40] in the latter two\nlattices contributes to the difference, since triangles are\nabsent in the von Neumann lattice. Note, however, that\nthe importance of overlapping triangles is evaluated with\nbc in [40], and with fc here. Comparing the curves for\nb = 1.04 in Figs. 3(b) and (c), keeping Fig. 1 in mind, we\nconclude that for high temptation values, one-site overlapping triangles gives more favorable conditions for cooperation, than the multiple-site case. For low temptation values the situation is reversed.\nIt is worth noting that the PD game on Moore and\nkagome lattices there is a nontrivial dependence of fc on\n\u03ba (which depends both on the temptation parameter and\nthe direction of strategy migration). In particular, for\nsufficiently small b, we obtain only one maximum of fc as\na function of \u03ba (the curve in Fig. 3(c) with b = 1.04 and\nVMLD). With increasing b, peculiarly, we observe two\npeaks of fc (\u03ba), one located at an intermediate value and\nthe other at \u03ba = 0. This phenomenon is yet more prominent in the case of IPLD (c.f., Fig. 4). Finally, if the value\nof b is sufficiently large (the curves of b = 1.1 in Fig. 3(b)\nand also Fig. 5), the peak of fc at finite \u03ba disappears and\nonly the no-noise maximum remains. For comparison, in\nFig. 6 we present analytic results via the four-site cluster\napproximation on the von Neumann lattice and five-site\ncluster approximation on the kagome lattice (for details,\nplease see the Appendix in Ref. [6]), and observe that the\ntheoretical estimations correctly predict the tendency of\nthe results obtained by our MC simulations.\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\nb\n\nFIG. 7: Average fraction fc of cooperation as a function of b\nin the case of very weak noise \u03ba = 0.01 on the kagome lattice\n(solid squares) and the Moore lattice (open circles).\n\nThe simulation results shown in Figs. 3, 4, and 5 allow\nus to speculate that in the limit of weak noise, the local\ninteraction topology may play a decisive role in maintaining cooperation. To test this point further, we present\nin Fig. 7 the simulation results for the evolutionary PD\non the Moore lattice and the kagome lattice, where fc as\na function of b is plotted for a fixed value of \u03ba = 0.01.\nHere we only consider the VMLD. We find that the cooperators vanish at about bc = 1.5 for the kagome lattice\n(which has already obtained in Ref. [40]), and at about\nbc = 1.2 for the Moore lattice. Despite the value of bc ,\nwe note that the average fraction of cooperation fc seems\nto be insensitive to the temptation to defect staying as a\nplateau as cooperators are capable of surviving (an effect\nnot studied in Ref. [40]). In the following, we provide a\nlocal configuration analysis for fc in the stationary state\non kagome lattices.\nIn the limit of weak noise, the strategy-updating rules\nEqs. (1) or (2) is equivalent to the deterministic imitation\ndynamics [10], i.e., as long as the payoff of the strategy\ndonor is greater than that of the strategy recipient, the\nstrategy will migrate. Since either an isolated cooperator, or a connected pair of cooperators, cannot prevail\nsurrounded by defectors, consider a five-site cluster of\ncooperators fully surrounded by defectors. If b < 3/2,\nthree cooperators forming a triangle will expand its territory to a five-site cluster, see Fig. 8. In that case we\nmay expect that one of the neighboring defectors, say j,\nwould since (b < 2) imitate i's strategy in the next sweep.\nThen their common neighbor k may acquire the payoff\n2b in the next sweep. However, since i gets a total payoff\n3; then, as long as b < 3/2, there is no chance that k's\nstrategy can migrate to i. In other words, such a local\nconfiguration in a sea of defectors if b < 3/2 is stable.\nHowever, if a neighbor l of k was a cooperator, the total\n\n\f7\nIV.\n\nj\n\ni\nk\n\nl\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Local configuration stability analysis\nin the limit of zero noise on the kagome lattice. The central\nfive-site cluster of cooperators cannot be destroyed as long\nas b < 3/2 even if no neighbor or next-nearest neighbor is a\ncooperator. See the text for details.\n\npayoff of k would be 3b (which is greater than 3), and in\nthat case k's strategy could migrate to i, hence destroying\nthe original cluster. Taken together, the necessary condition for a five-site cluster of cooperators existing stably\non the kagome lattice requires that b < 3/2 and, at the\nsame time, there is no cooperator in their next-nearest\nneighborhood. Since the second-nearest neighbors may\nbe shared by other five-site cluster of cooperators, we\ncan estimate fc to 5/(5 + 8 + 14/2) = 1/4 (8 and 14 are\nthe number of nearest and next-nearest neighbors of the\nfive-site cluster). This estimation is very close to the one\nobtained by MC simulations 0.256(2). Thus this localconfiguration stability analysis gives a good prediction for\nfc of evolutionary PD in the limit of weak noise on the\nkagome lattice. Indeed, we have visualized the networked\npopulation and found many isolated five-site clusters of\ncooperators on the kagome lattice (results now shown\nhere). The same analysis, with the same conclusions can\nbe done for the Moore lattice.\nThe above results might shed some light on the stability of cooperation in society. Real social networks often have distinct communities, where individuals in one\ngroups is densely connected, having relatively few connections to other groups [46]. The emergence of community structure may hinder the spread of defection, just as\nin the case of the five-site cluster on the kagome lattice\nabove. In this sense, our society may not be as sensitive\nto defection as indicated by the PD on the von Neumann\nlattice. On the other hand, we also show that VMLD\nis more efficient in maintaining and promoting cooperation than IPLD. Therefore, in the social situations, if\neveryone tries learn more from others, it would perhaps\nbe easier for people to work together efficiently.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we have studied the effects of the direction of strategy migration and noise on the evolution\nof cooperation in the spatial prisoner's dilemma game.\nTo this end, we have considered two types of strategy\nupdating dynamics, namely voter-model-like dynamics\nand invasion-process-like dynamics, on three types of lattice structures - square lattice with von Neumann and\nMoore neighborhoods, and kagome lattice. It was found\nthat the VMLD, rather than the IPLD, better sustain\nand promote cooperation on all the tested lattices. Furthermore, we found noise to have a nontrivial effect on the\nevolution of cooperation in spatial population. First, for\nlow temptation to defect, coherence resonance is found\nfor all three types of lattice, i.e., there is an optimal noise\nlevel for promoting cooperation. Second, for an intermediate temptation to defect, we observe a two-peak behavior (for Moore and kagome lattices) - the first maxima\nat zero noise, the other at a moderate noise levels (on\nthe von Neumann lattice, however, we observe no such\nbehavior). Third, for even higher temptation levels, only\nno noise maximizes cooperation. Moreover, we find that\nin the low-noise limit, the local lattice structure determines the fate of cooperators. We find, in the case of\nhigh temptation values, a structure of triangles overlapping at one site to benefit cooperation compared to a\nstructure of triangles overlapping at multiple sites. For\nlow temptation values, the situation is reversed and the\nmultiply overlapping triangles are beneficial. Our MCsimulation results are in good agreement with theoretical\npredictions obtained from mean-field cluster approximation methods. These results may enrich our knowledge of\nthe evolution of cooperation in spatially structured populations. A possible extension of the present work is to\nconsider evolutionary PD on degree-heterogeneous networks with the incorporation of asymmetric direction of\nstrategy migration. We expect that degree-heterogeneity\nwould induce a stronger difference in the final results, as\nwas found in voter model on such networks [35, 47].\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are greatly indebted to Dr. Jeromos Vukov\nfor numerous discussions of the five-site cluster algorithm. This research was supported by the Swedish Research Council and the Swedish Foundation for Strategic\nResearch.\nAPPENDIX A: A CONCRETE EXAMPLE\n\nIn this Appendix we present a small example illustrating how the voter-like dynamics supports cooperation\nbetter than the invasion-like dynamics. For the sake of\nsimplicity we consider a small system - a 4 \u00d7 4 square\nlattice with von Neumann neighborhood and periodic\n\n\f8\n\n= C\n\n= D\n\ni\n\ni\n\nj\n\n(a)\n\nThus, on a smooth interface, both VMLD and IPLD\nwill result in the same probability for strategy-migration.\nSince the defectors on the interface gain much less payoff than their cooperative neighbors (b is just little larger\nthan 1), we can expect cooperators could invade some\nof them as time evolves. Now, assume the configuration\nin Fig. 9(b), where the player j is surrounded by two\ncooperators, i and k. In such case, if j is selected to update strategy and VMLD is used, the probability for the\nplayer to become a cooperator is\n\nk\n\nj\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 9: Illustration of a small system with 4 \u00d7 4 players.\n(a) Both VMLD and IPLD give out the same transformation\nprobability for j to change from a defector to a cooperator.\n(b) The VMLD favors better the diffusion of cooperation than\nthe IPLD when the interface is rugged.\n\nboundary conditions. Initially, half of the sites of the\nlattice are occupied by cooperators, and the other half\nby defectors as shown in Fig. 9(a). We focus our attention on the probability of strategy-migration of one\nfocal player, say j, changing from D to C. In the case\nof VMLD, this may happen when the individual j is selected to update its state and choose the neighbor i as\nreference, which happens with probability 1/4. According to the payoff matrix of the PD, the individual i will\nget payoff 3, since there are three cooperators and one\ndefector in its neighborhood. In contrast, the individual\nj acquires only payoff b, which comes from the interaction with i. As a consequence, the expected probability\nfor the player j changing from D to C is\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\nWD\u2192C =\n+\n4 1 + exp[(2b \u2212 3)/\u03ba] 1 + exp[(2b \u2212 1)/\u03ba]\n1\n= (wij + wkj )\n(A2)\n4\nwhere wij /4 and wkj /4 denote, respectively, the probability of i's strategy, k's strategy convincing j. If, however,\nIPLD is adopted, the individual j could be imposed on\nthe cooperative strategy either by i or k, whose probability is given by\n\nWD\u2192C = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 wij /4)(1 \u2212 wkj /4)\nwij wkj \u0011\n1\u0010\nwij + wkj \u2212\n,\n=\n4\n4\n\n(A3)\n\nif VMLD is adopted. This is also the transformation\nprobability if IPLD is implemented, rather than VMLD.\n\nwhich is smaller than the corresponding value from\nEq. (A2). Note that we have assumed the neighbors of i,\nj, and k, have not changed their strategies between the\ntwo events (from the updating time of i to that of j). In\nsum this illustrates how the VMLD favors the migration\nof cooperative strategy along the interface separating cooperators and defectors as compared to the IPLD. Note\nthat this argument cannot be reversed to hold for cooperators instead of defectors (considering say i in Fig. 9(a)\nbeing a defector). The reason is that, on average, the\npayoffs of defectors along the interface are smaller than\nthose of the cooperators [19, 33], which disables the benefit of the VMLD, and thereby inhibits the diffusion of\ndefection.\n\n[1] R.
