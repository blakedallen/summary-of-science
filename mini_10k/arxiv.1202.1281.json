It has been recently proposed that the gravitational interaction can be explained as an\nentropic force. Although a well defined fundamental description for such a mechanism is lacking, it\nis still possible to address the viability of phenomenological models of entropic-inspired modified\ngravities. I will summarize some recent work directed to using cosmology as a tool to constraint\nscenarios aimed to explain the physics behind dark energy and inflation. A phenomenological\nmodification is able to explain cosmic acceleration at the background level and fit observations,\nbut simple inflationary models with higher curvature corrections are incompatible with a matter\ndominated expansion era.\nKeywords: Cosmology, Modified theories of gravity\nPACS: 98.80.-k, 04.50.Kd, 04.60.Bc\n\nINTRODUCTION\nA recent proposal by Verlinde, stating that gravity may be an entropic force [1], provides\na concrete idea to examine the connections between gravitation and thermodynamics\n[2, 3] and the emergence of space time [4]. The formulation is heuristic, based on some\nnotions of holography, the assumption of a statistical force F\u2206x = T \u2206S, together with\nsome basic thermodynamical relations. Although it has raised several lines of criticism,\nthe idea is difficult to rule out precisely because of the lack of a concrete formulation.\nRather than trying to guess the fundamental underlying mechanism describing the\nmicro-structure of space time, I will describe some approaches to address simple models\nof entropic inspired modifications of gravity, and use cosmological data to constraint\nthem [5]. In particular, I will focus on models for inflation and dark energy based on\ncorrections to the horizon entropy-area law of the form\nS=\n\nA\n+ s(A) .\n4l2P\n\n(1)\n\nMODIFIED FRIEDMANN EQUATIONS\nIn Verlinde's approach,\u0010equation (1)\n\u0011 can be easily used to derived the modified NewtoGMm\n\u2202s\n2\nnian force F = \u2212 R2 1 + 4lP \u2202 A . It is then possible to use semi-general-relativistic\narguments to construct the modified Friedmann equations that govern the zero order,\nhomogeneous expansion of the universe [6]. In the following I will consider a phenomenological power law parameterization of s(A) as well as the leading order corrections expected in some fundamental theories.\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Bounds on parameters for power law area-entropy corrections [5] obtained using Sne\n[7] (blue), CMB distance priors [8] (orange), and BAO [9] (green) and the combined datasets (gray).\nThe entropic corrections are parameterized in terms of \u03a9S , which is given by the part of equation (2)\nproportional to \u03c3 . Entropic corrections give a slightly worse fit \u03c7S2 = 533.28 than a similar MCMC for\n\u039bCDM allowing curvature \u03c7\u039b2 = 532.34.\n\nPhenomenological modifications to the entropy-area law\nA simple way to parameterize deviations from the entropy area\n(1) is by the\n\u0010 \u0011law\nn\nA\n[6, 10, 11]. The\naddition of a term which is a power law of the area, s(A) = 4\u03c0\u03c3\nn\nl2P\nmodified Friedmann equation in such models has the following form\n!n\u22121 #\n\"\nk\n\u03c0\nG\n(1\n+\n3w\n)\n8\n1\ni\n\u03c1i .\n(2)\nH2 + 2 =\n1+\u03c3\na\n3 \u2211\n1 + 3wi \u2212 2n l2P (H 2 + k2 )\ni\na\nNot surprisingly, the low curvature n > 1 corrections are precisely those which could\nbe significant in cosmology at late times. In the spatially flat case with a single fluid\nsatisfying p = w\u03c1 , and when the correction terms dominate in Eq. (2), the expansion is\ndescribed by the effective EoS we f f = 1+w\nn \u2212 1, allowing accelerated expansion if n > 3\n(for w = 0). With larger n, the effective EoS is more negative, but phantom expansion can\nbe achieved only when w is itself negative. A Monte Carlo Markov Chain investigation of\nthe parameter space (Figure 1) shows that a good fit was obtained for \u03a9S = 0.69 \u00b1 0.02,\nn = 3.8 \u00b1 0.7 with a tendence towards a slightly closed universe.\nA simple way to study the growth of perturbations is by linking the evolution of\nan spherical inhomogeneity to the background expansion by assuming that the JebsenBirkhoff theorem holds [12]. In that case,\u0010 linear perturbations\nare given as the solutions\n\u0011\n\u1e26\nto the differential equation \u03b4\u0308 + 2H \u03b4\u0307 = 2\u1e22 + H \u03b4 . The r.h.s. side is different to the\nstandard gravity source term 4\u03c0 G\u03c1M \u03b4 , leading to distinct predictions at the onset of late\ntime acceleration. Although current data is unable to significantly sharpen the constraints\nshown in Figure 1, it is foreseeable that future galaxy surveys do.\n\n\fLeading corrections in quantum gravity\nBesides the purely phenomenological parameterization discussed above, some authors have proposed modifications of the entropy-area law based on corrections from\nquantum gravity, which are argued to be proportional to the logarithm and the inverse\nof the area [6]. Another set of proposals link the modifications to the action of the holographic, surface terms in the gravitational action [13, 14]. Neglecting spatial curvature,\nall these modifications can be encompassed in a set of modified Friedmann equations\ndescribed by six parameters:\n8\u03c0 G\n\u039b\n\u03c1 + + \u03b11 H 2 + \u03b12 \u1e22 + 8\u03c0 G\u03b13 H 4 ,\n3\n3\n\u039b\n4\u03c0 G\n(1 + 3w)\u03c1 + + \u03b21 H 2 + \u03b22 \u1e22 + 8\u03c0 G\u03b23 H 4 .\n= \u2212\n3\n3\n\nH2 =\n\u1e22 + H 2\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nSolutions as a function of the scale factor exist provided that the energy density is\ndescribed by a fluid with constant equation of state. The cosmological constraints that\ncan be obtained for this type of models are summarized in the following paragraphs,\nfurther details can be found in [5].\nPrimordial Nucleosynthesys. Neglecting the cosmological constant, the solution of\n(3,4) can be recasted in the standard form, but with a modified gravitational constant.\nStringent bounds on \u03b4 Ge f f /G from the abundances of light elementes [15] require\n\u03b11 )(1+w)\u22122\u03b21\n\u22123 and \u22122 * 1084 < \u03b13 (1+3w)+2\u03b23 <\nthat \u22123.5 * 10\u22123 < 2 \u2212 (3\u2212\n2\u2212\u03b1 (1+3w)\u22122\u03b2 < 1.1 * 10\n2\u2212\u03b1 (1+3w)\u22122\u03b2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n6 * 1084 . The constraints on the H 4 terms (\u03b13 , \u03b23 ) are very weak because of the enormous\nhierarchy between the Planck and the nucleosynthesis scales.\n\nInflation. In the limit a \u2192 0, the early time solution yields a constant expansion\n(3\u2212\u03b1 )(1+w)\u22122\u03b2\nrate 8\u03c0 GHI2 \u2248 8\u03c0 G(\u03b11 (1+3w)+2\u03b21 ) . Therefore this model can provide inflation if higher\n3\n3\ncurvature corrections \u03b13 , \u03b23 6= 0 are present (However, this type of corrections enter\nin conflict with the addition of a cosmological constant, see below). Assuming that\ninflationary perturbations are generated the same way as by a single scalar field, a\ntentative value for the H 4 corrections can be obtained from the CMB normalization\nand the spectral index 8\u03c0 GHI2 \u223c 10\u221210 \u03b5 \u2248 10\u221212 .\nCosmological Constant. For \u039b 6= 0, the solution of (3,4) has the rather involved form\n2\n2\nH 2 = C41\u03c0+C\nG \u2212 1+(a/a0 )2C3 , in terms of dimensionless coefficients Ci (\u03b1 j , \u03b2 j , w, \u039b). This\nsolution fails to provide a matter domination phase and is therefore not cosmologically\nviable. The particular form is due to the higher order curvature corrections, and since\nthere is no well defined limit \u03b13 , \u03b23 \u2192 0, the high order corrections (3,4).\nOnce \u03b13 , \u03b23 have been set to zero, the effect\u0010of the remaining terms\n\u0011 is to modify the\n2 (3\u2212\u03b11 )(1+w)\u22122\u03b21\nscaling of matter to an effective e.o.s. wM = 3 2\u2212\u03b1 (1+3w)\u22122\u03b2 \u2212 2 . Departures from\n2\n2\nwM = 0 can be constrained by fitting the modified expansion to data from SNe,BAO and\nCMB distances, resulting in the limit \u221217.28 * 10\u22123 < 3wM < 20.50 * 10\u22123.\n\n\fAnother posibility is to introduce the cosmological constant through a source term,\nsuch that the right scaling for presureless matter is preserved. In that situation the\ndominant effect is a modification of the e.o.s. for \u039b, which is modified to w\u039b = \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b21 .\nThe tightest bound on this effect [8] is \u22120.05 < w\u039b < 0.11.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe origin of the thermodynamical properties of space-time remains mysterious. Even\nin that case, simple modified theories of gravity based on the entropic gravity proposal\ncan be motivated, constructed and explored to a certain extent using cosmological\ninformation. Modifications of the entropy-area law can provide mechanisms for dark\nenergy and generically have observable consequences, although simple inflationary\nscenarios are problematic due to the effects of higher curvature corrections at cosmological constant domination. It is possible to constraint these simple models even in the\nabsence of a complete formulation, but eventually a full paradigm would be necessary\nto properly address the full set of predictions and eventually validate or rule out the\nconcept of entropic gravity and its possible variations.\nAcknowledgements: Tomi S.
