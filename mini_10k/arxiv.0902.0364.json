This is the case for a\ntheory at its quantum critical point. For relativistically\ninvariant theories having a conserved U (1) current j\u03bc (x),\nthe current correlation function at criticality has a remarkable simple form, being given by [1]\nhj\u03bc (x)j\u03bd (0)i =\n\nk\nSd2 x2(d\u22121)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2x\u03bc x\u03bd\n,\n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\nx2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Sd = 2\u03c0 d/2 /\u0393(d/2) is the surface of a unit sphere in\nd spacetime dimensions. The above result follows from\nthe conformal invariance of the quantum critical point\nand the fact that (on-shell) conserved U (1) currents do\nnot have an anomalous dimension. Thus, the dimensionless number k is the central charge of the U (1) current\nin a d-dimensional conformal field theory (CFTd ).\nAnother dimensionless number, k \u2032 , is defined at a\nquantum critical point and finite temperature via the\ncharge susceptibility \u03c7 = limV \u2192\u221e hQ2 i/V , where Q is\nthe conserved charge associated to the U (1) current, i.e.,\nit is simply obtained by integrating j0 (x) over d\u22121 spatial\ndimensions. Thus, dimensional analysis and universality\nimplies\n\u03c7 = k \u2032 T d\u22122.\n\n(2)\n\nRecently, Kovtun and Ritz [2] have shown that for theories having a gravitational dual [3, 4], the following relation holds,\nk\u2032\n1\nrG (d) \u2261\n=\nk\n2\u03c0 d/2\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\n\u0012\n\n4\u03c0\nd\n\n\u0013d\u22122\n\n\u03933 (d/2)\n,\n\u0393(d)\n\naddress: nogueira@physik.fu-berlin.de\n\n(3)\n\nwhich for d = 2 agrees with the exact result for a CFT2\n[2], namely,\nk\u2032\nk\n\n=\nd=2\n\n1\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nthe latter being complementary to a well-known relation\nfor the central charge of the energy-momentum tensor, c,\nand the universal amplitude of the free-energy [5, 6].\nIt would be interesting to find examples where the result (3) holds. Note that this would not necessarily imply that a theory fulfilling (3) has a gravitational dual,\nbut finding such an example would be very encouraging.\nIn this paper we will show that condensed matter systems at quantum criticality may provide relatively simple\nquantitative tests of gravitational duality. We will derive\nresults for k and k \u2032 in effective theories of quantum antiferromagnets. These results will then be compared with\nthose predicted by the gauge-gravity duality.\nThe quantum critical point of an SU (N ) quantum antiferromagnet is described by an Abelian Higgs model\nwith N complex bosons [7, 8], i.e.,\nN\n\nL =\n\nX\n1 2\nF\u03bc\u03bd +\n|D\u03bc z\u03b1 |2\n4\na=1\nN\nX\n\nu0\n+ r0\n|z\u03b1 | +\n2\na=1\n2\n\nN\nX\n\na=1\n\n|z\u03b1 |\n\n2\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + ie0 A\u03bc . Obviously, the conserved U (1)\ncurrent for the above Lagrangian is\nj\u03bc = \u2212ie0\n\nN\nX\n\n(za\u2217 D\u03bc za \u2212 za D\u03bc\u2217 za\u2217 ).\n\n(6)\n\na=1\n\nFor a spin 1/2 antiferromagnet, the Lagrangian (5) follows from the representation of the spin orientation field\nas n(x) = za\u2217 (x)\u03c3 ab zb (x), where the fields za represent\nthe so called spinons and \u03c3 = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 ) is a vector\n\n\f2\nhaving the Pauli matrices as components. The generalization to SU (N ) follows simply by replacing the Pauli\nmatrices by the generators of SU (N ). From this representation a local gauge symmetry naturally emerges,\nsince the spin orientation field n(x) remains invariant under the local phase transformation za (x) \u2192 ei\u03b8(x) za (x).\nPerturbatively, this theory has a quantum critical point\nfor large enough N and 2 < d < 4 [9, 10], in which case\nthe spinons za are deconfined in the sense defined precisely in Ref. [8]. A quantum critical point has been\nfound non-perturbatively for all N by means of the exact\nRG [11]. For d = 3 spacetime dimensions this quantum critical point separates two distinct Mott insulating\nphases. In one of these phases the fields za are condensed,\nleading in this way to antiferromagnetic (AF) order. This\ncorresponds to a Higgs phase in particle physics terminology. The other phase is paramagnetic and corresponds\nin the lattice to an insulating pattern formed by a crystalline structure of singlet bonds, the so called valencebond solid (VBS) [12]. In particle physics language, this\nphase corresponds to a spinon confinement phase. The\ncharacter of the AF-VBS phase transition for SU (2) spins\nis at present controversial, with some numerical results\nin the lattice favoring a second-order phase transition\n(and therefore, the existence of a quantum critical point)\n[13], while other numerical results favor a weak first-order\nphase transition [14]. In this paper we will assume that\na quantum critical point exists, which is definitly true if\nN is large enough and 2 < d < 4 [15]. Precisely at the\nquantum critical point the theory is a CFTd .\nLet us show that there exists an exact relation between\nthe number k in Eq. (1) and the dimensionless renormalized gauge coupling at the quantum critical point. The\nrenormalized gauge coupling is uniquely determined by\nthe vacuum polarization, as dictated by the Ward identities. The vacuum polarization, on the other hand, is\nrelated in momentum space to the current correlation\nfunction by\n\u03a0(p) = \u2212\n\ne20\nhj(p) * j(\u2212p)i,\n(d \u2212 1)p2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere e20 is the bare gauge coupling. Therefore, the renormalized gauge coupling e2 (p) is given by the exact expression\n1\n1\n1\nhj(p) * j(\u2212p)i.\n= 2\u2212\ne2 (p)\ne0\n(d \u2212 1)p2\n\n(8)\n\nWe are interested in the regime near or at the quantum\ncritical point, so that |p| \u226a e20 , which is the regime where\nEq. (1) is valid. From Eq. (1) it is easy to obtain that\nhj(p) * j(\u2212p)i =\n\n(d \u2212 2)\u0393(1 \u2212 d/2)\u03932 (d/2)\nk|p|d\u22122 . (9)\n(4\u03c0)d/2 \u0393(d \u2212 1)\n\nThe dimensionless gauge coupling is defined by f (p) =\npd\u22124 e2 (p). Its critical value is given by the RG fixed\npoint f\u2217 = limp\u21920 f (p). Therefore, we obtain from Eqs.\n\n(8) and (9) that k is exactly related to the fixed point f\u2217\nvia the formula:\nk=\n\n2d\u22121 \u03c0 d/2 \u0393(d)\n1\n.\n\u0393(2 \u2212 d/2)\u03932 (d/2) f\u2217\n\n(10)\n\nA similar relation holds in theories admitting a gravitational dual, with the difference that the central charge\nof the theory in the boundary is related to the gauge coupling of the theory in the bulk, which is also coupled to\ngravity in an AdS background. Indeed, an expression for\nthe central charge k in terms of the gauge coupling of the\nEinstein-Maxwell action in a (d + 1)-dimensional anti-de\nSitter (AdSd ) spacetime was derived by Freedman et al.\n[18]. The Einstein-Maxwell action is\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nS =\ndd+1 x \u2212g[R + d(d \u2212 1)\u039b]\n16\u03c0G\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n2\n\u2212\ndd+1 x \u2212gF\u03bc\u03bd\n.\n(11)\n2\n4gd+1\nThe cosmological constant in the above action sets\nthe scale to define the dimensionless gauge coupling as\n2\n2\n\u011dd+1\n= \u039b(d\u22123)/2 gd+1\n. The U (1) central charge k of the\nCFTd on the boundary is related to the gauge coupling\nof the theory in the bulk by [18]\nk=\n\n2\u03c0 d/2 (d \u2212 2)\u0393(d) 1\n.\n2\n\u03933 (d/2)\n\u011dd+1\n\n(12)\n\nNote that, in contrast with Eq. (10), where f\u2217 is the\n2\ncoupling constant of the CFTd , in Eq. (12) \u011dd+1\nis the\ncoupling constant of the theory with gravity. Remarkably, Eqs. (10) and (12) have exactly the same form for\nd = 3 spacetime dimensions, where g42 is dimensionless:\nk=\n\n32\n,\nf\u2217\n\nk=\n\n32\n.\ng42\n\n(13)\n\nDespite the similarity between the two k's, we cannot\nsafely claim that f\u2217 can be identified with g42 , since unfortunately the symmetries of the quantum antiferromagnet do not entirely match with the ones of the supergravity theory. Another important issue is that usually\nin applications involving the quark-gluon plasma [19] or\nquantum critical phenomena in condensed matter physics\n[20, 21, 22] the current is associated to a global symmetry of the boundary theory. Here, in order to relate k\nto the fixed point f\u2217 , we have considered a current having a local gauge symmetry. In SU (N ) supersymmetric\nQCD, where the \u03b2 function is exactly known [23], many\nother interesting results for the central charges of gauge\ninvariant currents are known [24].\nAs a concrete example, let us consider the large N limit\nof the theory (5). In this case we have in d spacetime\ndimensions,\nf\u2217 =\n\n(4\u03c0)d/2 (d \u2212 2)\u0393(d)\n,\n4\u0393(2 \u2212 d/2)\u03932 (d/2)N\n\n(14)\n\n\f3\nwhich is just the fixed point of the RG one-loop \u03b2 function for a fixed dimensionality [25]. Thus, Eq. (10) yields\n2N\n,\n(15)\nd\u22122\nwhich is the same result as for a free scalar field theory\nfeaturing N complex fields. Up to the factor N , this is\nalso the same result as in the conformally invariant O(n)\nmodel [26, 27]. For d = 3 the fixed point (14) becomes\nf\u2217 = 16/N . The four-dimensional gauge coupling constant of the gravitational\ntheory, on the other hand, is\n\u221a\ngiven by g42 = 6\u03c0/( 2N 3/2 ) [20]. Thus, we see that the\ngravitational theory yields\n\u221a a non-perturbative value of k,\nsince in this case k = 16 2N 3/2 /(3\u03c0) instead of giving a\nresult \u223c O(N ).\nIf in addition we minimally couple the theory in (5) to\nNf Dirac fermions (with four-component spinors), corresponding to the algebraic charge liquid [10, 15, 16, 28],\nwe obtain for large N and Nf , with N/Nf arbitrary, the\nresult\n2N + 4(d \u2212 2)Nf\nk=\n.\n(16)\nd\u22122\nThus, for the purely fermionic case we have k = 4Nf .\nThe above results can also be applied to the easy-plane\nsystem, by generalizing the global U (1) \u00d7 U (1) symmetry to O(N ) \u00d7 O(N ) with N even [9]. Although the\neasy-plane antiferromagnet exhibits a first-order phase\ntransition [29] (this is true for all N ; see Ref. [9]), the\ncentral charge k depends only on the fixed point f\u2217 and\nnot on the other couplings of the theory. In this case a\nreal value of f\u2217 can always be found for large enough N in\na minimal subtraction scheme. Indeed, the \u03b2 function of\nthe gauge coupling f is only a function of f , not depending on the other couplings of the theory. Resummation\nschemes actually indicate that f\u2217 may exist for all values\nof N [30].\nLet us give a clear example of a situation in gauge\ntheories where a universal constant appears even in the\nabsence of a second-order phase transition. A simple\nexample is provided by the static particle-antiparticle\npotential calculated from the Wilson loop. Quite generally, the static interquark potential is given at large\ndistances by V (L) = \u03c4s L \u2212 C/L + O(1/L2 ), where \u03c4s\nis the string tension and C is a universal constant. It\nturns out that the constant C is always universal, even\nif no quantum critical points exist, like for example in\nthe case of Polyakov's compact Maxwell electrodynamics\n[31], where no phase transition happens, i.e., the string\ntension is always nonzero. The reason for this can be\nstated in very simple terms [32]: the contribution \u221d T /L\nin the large L expansion of T V (L) is invariant under a\nscale transformation T \u2192 \u03bbT , L \u2192 \u03bbL. For a bosonic\nstring model of quark confinement we have, for example,\nC = (d \u2212 2)\u03c0/24 [33]. The constant C is related to the\ncurrent correlation function. Indeed, a simple calculation\nfor an Abelian gauge theory yields\nk=\n\nC=\n\nSd (d \u2212 2)f\u2217\n.\n2d \u03c0 d\u22121\n\n(17)\n\nAlthough in the seld-dual easy-plane case, no quantum\ncritical point arises, it is possible to find a zero for the \u03b2\nfunction of the gauge coupling, so that C will be a universal number. Similarly, other relations involving the\ncurrent correlation function hold. For instance, the universal relations derived in Ref. [20] for the self-dual easyplane antiferromagnet seem to remain valid, although the\nsystem, at zero temperature, exhibits a first-order phase\ntransition [9, 29].\nAn exact computation of k \u2032 in terms of f\u2217 is not as\nstraightforward as in the case of the central charge k of\nthe U (1) current. However, since at large N the central\ncharge k has the same value as in a free theory with N\ncomplex scalar fields [an O(2N )-invariant theory], it is instructive to calculate k \u2032 for this free theory and compute\nthe ratio k \u2032 /k. The calculation of \u03c7 is more easily done\nby coupling j0 (x) to a uniform source h and computing\n\u03c7 = \u2212\u2202 2 f /\u2202h2 |h=0 , where f is the free-energy density at\nthe presence of the external source. This leads us to the\nresult\n\u221e Z\nX\ndd\u22121 p\n\u03c9n2\n\u03c7 = 4N T\n,\n(18)\n(2\u03c0)d\u22121 (\u03c9n2 + p2 )2\nn=\u2212\u221e\nwhere \u03c9n = 2\u03c0nT . By performing explicitly the Matsubara sum and the momentum integral, we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\u2212d\n\u03b6(3 \u2212 d).\n(19)\nk \u2032 = N \u03c0 (d\u22125)/2 (d \u2212 3)\u0393\n2\nIn particular, for d = 3 we have k \u2032 = N/\u03c0. Therefore, we\nobtain the ratio between the k \u2032 above and the k given in\nEq. (15) as\nk\u2032\n\u03c0 (d\u22125)/2 (d \u2212 2)(d \u2212 3)\nrfree (d) \u2261\n=\n\u0393\nk\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n3\u2212d\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b6(3\u2212d).\n\n(20)\nThis is the exact result for a free theory. Note that for\nd = 2 it agrees with Eq. (4), as it should. Interestingly,\nthe d = 2 result is in this case the same as the d = 3 one,\ni.e., rfree (2) = rfree (3) = 1/(2\u03c0). This actually reflects a\nmore general property of rfree (d), namely,\nrfree (d) = rfree (5 \u2212 d).\n\n(21)\n\nThe prediction for k \u2032 from the AdSd+1 /CFTd correspondence is [2]\nk\u2032 =\n\nd\u22122\n2\n\u011dd+1\n\n\u0012\n\n4\u03c0\nd\n\n\u0013d\u22122\n\n,\n\n(22)\n\nwhich when divided by Eq. (12) gives the relation (3).\nNote that rG (3) = \u03c0/24 < rfree (3). In Fig. 1 we plot\nthe ratios rG (d) and rfree (d) in the range 2 \u2264 d \u2264 4. We\nsee from the figure that rG (d) \u2264 rfree (d) in the interval\n2 \u2264 d \u2264 4.\nThe value of the ratio k \u2032 /k for the O(n) non-linear \u03c3model [27] at large n and d = 3 was given in Ref. [2] as\n\n\f4\n\n0.20\n0.18\n0.16\n0.14\n0.12\n0.10\n0.08\n0.06\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\nd\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nFIG. 1: Comparison between the ratios rG (d) and rfree (d).\nThe continuous line represents rG (d), while the dashed line\ncorresponds to rfree (d). The point represents the ratio k\u2032 /k\nfor the O(n) non-linear \u03c3-model at large n and d = 3 [see Eq.\n(23)].\n\n[34]\nrO(n)\n\n\u221a\n5\nln\n=\n2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n5+1\n2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\nwhich is about 7% larger than rfree (3). Thus, for d = 3\nthe free theory result is closer to the gravitational dual\nprediction than the corresponding large n result for the\nO(n) non-linear \u03c3-model.\nIn Ref. [35] (see also Ref. [36]) it was conjectured that\nthere is a duality between the critical interacting O(n)\nmodel in d = 3 and an even spin gauge theory defined in\nAdS4 . It would be interesting to see such a gravitational\ndual construction working also in the case of the gauge\ntheory formulation of quantum antiferromagnets.\nIn summary, we have seen that at zero temperature the\nquantum critical gauge coupling of an SU (N ) quantum\nantiferromagnet is related via an exact formula to the\ncentral charge k of the conserved U (1) current [Eq. (10)].\n\n[1] We have chosen here to follow Ref. [2] and include a factor Sd2 in the definition of k via the current correlation\nfunction.\n[2] P. Kovtun and A. Ritz, Phys. Rev.

Balents, S. Sachdev, and\n\nThere is a corresponding formula for theories having a\ngravitational dual [18] [Eq. (12)]. However, it relates\nthe gauge coupling of a (d + 1)-dimensional gravitational\ntheory to the central charge of the U (1) current in a confomal theory living at the boundary. These expressions\nhave the same form for d = 3, where the gauge coupling\nof the gravitational theory is dimensionless. At finite\ntemperature we have computed the amplitude k \u2032 of the\ncharge susceptibility at quantum criticality in the large\nN limit, which in this case is the same as the exact result\nfor a model consisting of N complex scalar fields. The\nratio k \u2032 /k at large N was compared with the prediction\nof the gauge-gravity duality. They both agree at d = 2\nwith the exact result k \u2032 /k = 1/(2\u03c0) for two-dimensional\nconformal field theories [2]. On the other hand, the derived large N result for k \u2032 /k is found to differ at d = 3\nof about 18% from the gauge-gravity dual prediction. It\nwould be interesting to see if better approximations can\nget closer to the gravitational duality result. One promising approach in this case is an expansion in \u01eb = 4 \u2212 d,\nwhere one would be able to give results for finite N . Another future project is to derive an exact formula for k \u2032\nin terms of f\u2217 , as we did with k. It would be interesting\nif such a formula for d = 3 has a form similar to Eq.\n(22), in the same way as with k in Eq. (13). However, it\nshould be mentioned here that such a computation may\nlead instead to a breakdown of the universaly of the ratio\nk \u2032 /k. For instance, in the context of the AdSd+1 /CFTd\ncorrespondence, Ritz and Ward [37] have recently shown\nthat deviations from classical gravity in the bulk due to\nWeyl corrections in the Einstein-Maxwell action lead to\na non-universal result for k \u2032 /k.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to thank S.

Dirac fermions represent in this context the\ndoping of the system near a spinon deconfinement phase\ntransition. The resulting quantum liquid, the so called\nalgebraic charge liquid [16], seems to describe well many\nof the features of high-Tc superconductors in the underdoped regime. There are other situations where fermionic\ndegrees of freedom are known to facilitate the emergence\nof a quantum critical point. For example, there is a supersymmetric model where deconfined quantum criticality is\nknown to occur [17].\nR. K. Kaul, Y. B. Kim, S. Sachdev, and T. Senthil, Nature Physics 4, 28 (2008).\nS.
