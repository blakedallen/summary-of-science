Introduction\nString theory vacua are explicit realizations of the ideas of Kaluza and Klein on extra\ndimensions. As such, geometric structures inevitably play a central role in studying such\nvacua. Geometric techniques are widely used for phenomenological model building in the\nheterotic string.\nIn the past few years we have learnt to start applying techniques from geometric\nengineering to model building problems in type II settings. Using ideas about exceptional\ncollections, this led to the construction of 'local models' in which the force of gravity\nmay be treated as a small perturbation [1, 2, 3]. More recently it led to the first new\nclass of models since the appearance of the heterotic string that can successfully explain\nunification, namely F -theory GUTs [4, 5, 6]. The F -theory models allow for scenarios\nnot available in the heterotic string, such as gauge mediation, and hence may display\nsome strikingly different signatures. Since they have been relatively little studied, it is\ndesirable to develop the phenomenology and mathematics of these models in more detail.\nA number of interesting papers have recently appeared on this topic.\nIn this project we follow a slightly different direction. In light of the line of research\nmentioned above, it is natural to ask if a similar set of ideas based on geometric engineering may also be used to address some of the difficulties encountered in constructing\nphenomenological models in other type II settings. Here we would like to address the\nconstruction of GUT models in M-theory. Although such models were expected to exist\nand qualitative features have been studied assuming their existence, there are currently\nno examples or techniques for explicitly constructing them. For a recent summary see [7].\nOne of the main ideas that we employ, in physical terms, is the central role played by\nthe BPS equations of a 'worldvolume' supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, which lives in\nseven dimensions in the present case. In mathematical terms we are dealing with Higgs\nbundles, that is a gauge field and an adjoint Higgs field satisfying a version of Hitchin's\nequations, which are exactly the BPS equations of the 7d Yang-Mills theory. Even though\nwe are in a non-perturbative regime of string theory, the gauge theory description can\nbe trusted as long as the gauge and Higgs field are slowly varying. This strategy was\nsuccessfully used in recent phenomenological constructions in F -theory, and we will see\nhow it carries over in M-theory.\nOn the other hand, supersymmetric compactifications of M-theory to four dimensions\nare known to be given by G2 -manifolds. The principle that the worldvolume gauge theory\ncompletely determines the local geometry of the brane is well-established in other contexts\nin string theory. Therefore we expect that our approach should establish the existence\nof a large class of non-compact G2 manifolds with singularities. We will outline how one\nrecovers the data of a non-compact G2 -manifold with singularities from the data of the\ncompactified 7d gauge theory, but we will not give a complete proof of the correspondence\n3\n\n\fin this paper. At any rate, string, M or F -theory only plays a secondary role in our\nphilosophy. The primary object of interest is the higher dimensional Yang-Mills theory,\nand the main role of string/M/F -theory is to provide a UV completion of this Yang-Mills\ntheory.\nSpectral covers are a powerful technique for constructing solutions to Hitchin's equations. In the present setting, spectral covers correspond to Lagrangian A-branes in the\nauxiliary Calabi-Yau geometry T \u2217 S 3 , and thus much of our intuition about intersecting\nLagrangians can be carried over. To some extent this is not surprising, because if we\ndo not use exceptional gauge groups, then we should be able to take a perturbative IIa\nlimit and end up with a configuration of D6-branes and orientifold planes on a CalabiYau. However our Lagrangian branes are intrinsic to the 7d Yang-Mills theory and do\nnot assume any string or M-theory.\nFor phenomenological purposes it is important to understand the spectrum and interactions in such models. Some qualitative results have already been obtained in the\nliterature. Here we will find that these results may be better understood and extended\nusing Morse theory as a principal tool. As a result, we find that the massless spectrum\nand many of the interactions reflect topological properties of the configuration, and can\nbe computed without any knowledge of the solutions of the D-term equations. This is a\nremarkable simplification which should be of great help in understanding the phenomenological signatures of these models.\nIn this paper we mostly focus on abelian examples, although we will make statements\nthat apply more generally. Work on non-abelian examples is still in progress [8].\n\n4\n\n\f2. Local models in M-theory\nAs mentioned in the introduction, our goal will be to construct compactifications of\nthe 7d supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Such compactifications are mathematically\ndescribed by Higgs bundles. In order to explain the relevance of such compactifications to\nM-theory, we have to explain how this data is related to G2 manifolds with singularities.\nThe main purpose of this section is to set up the dictionary between ALE-fibrations in\nM-theory, Higgs bundles, and spectral covers in an auxiliary Calabi-Yau geometry.\n2.1. General properties of G2 -manifolds\nWe are interested in engineering effectively four-dimensional models from M-theory.\nSince M-theory lives in 11d, this means we must compactify on a seven-dimensional\ninternal space X7 . Furthermore, if we require N = 1 supersymmetry in four dimensions,\nthen X7 should admit a Killing spinor. As is well-known, the existence of a Killing spinor\nimplies that X7 must admit a metric of G2 -holonomy. Such metrics are hard to find\nexplicitly. However, much like Calabi-Yau metrics which are also hard to find, one may\nreformulate the problem of finding G2 -metrics in terms of anti-symmetric tensor fields,\nwhich are much easier to work with. For G2 manifolds, the relevant tensor field is a\nthree-form \u03a6.\nGiven a smooth 7-manifold, a three-form \u03a6 is said to be stable if it lies in an open\norbit of Gl(7). In terms of a 7-bein, \u03a6 may be written as\n\u03a6 = e1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 e3 + ei \u2227 \u03a3i\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere\n\u03a31 = e4 \u2227 e5 \u2212 e6 \u2227 e7 ,\n\n\u03a32 = e4 \u2227 e6 \u2212 e7 \u2227 e5 ,\n\n\u03a33 = e4 \u2227 e7 \u2212 e5 \u2227 e6\n\n(2.2)\n\nFrom such a three-form, one may reconstruct a metric through the following formulae [9]:\ngij = det(sij )\u22121/9 sij\n1\n1\nsij = \u2212\n\u03a6i\u03bc1 \u03bc2 \u03a6j\u03bc3 \u03bc4 \u03a6\u03bc5 \u03bc6 \u03bc7 \u01eb\u03bc1 ...\u03bc7 \u223c \u2212\n\u03a6i \u2227 \u03a6j \u2227 \u03a6\n144\n144\n\n(2.3)\n\nIn terms of \u03a6, the condition that the metric has G2 holonomy is equivalent to [10]\n(F \u2212 term)\n(D \u2212 term)\n\nd\u03a6 = 0\nd \u2217\u03a6 \u03a6 = 0\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe \u2217-operator depends on the metric and hence implicitly on \u03a6, as we have indicated.\n5\n\n\fThese two equations can be obtained as the critical points of two functionals which\nhave a natural four-dimensional interpretation.R The first equation in (2.4) is the equation\nof motion of a Chern-Simons functional W \u223c \u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6. In fact, M-theory not only yields\na metric but also a three-form tensor field C3 , and in N = 1 SUSY compactifications it\nis natural to combine them in a single complex three-form field C3 + i\u03a6. A quick way\nto see this is by reducing on a circle to type IIa, in which case we get the complexified\nK\u00e4hler form B + iJ as required by supersymmetry. Including the dynamics of C3 , the\nBPS equations are generalized to\nd(C3 + i\u03a6) = 0\nd \u2217\u03a6 \u03a6 = 0\n\n(2.5)\n\nand the Chern-Simons functional may be generalized to:\n1\nW =\n16\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\nX7\n\n(C3 + i\u03a6) \u2227 d(C3 + i\u03a6)\n\n(2.6)\n\nThis expression combines both the action of [11, 12, 13] and that of Hitchin [14]. It is\ninterpreted as a term in the four-dimensional superpotential.\nThe second equation in (2.5) can be interpreted as a moment map condition. The\nthree-form field in M-theory transforms under a group G of gauge transformations as\nC3 \u2192 C3 + d\u039b. We also have a natural K\u00e4hler form associated to the metric\nZ\n\nX7\n\n(C3\u2032 + i\u03a6\u2032 ) \u2227 \u2217\u03a6 (C3\u2032\u2032 + i\u03a6\u2032\u2032 )\n\n(2.7)\n\non the space of solutions of the F -terms. Then i d\u2020 \u03a6 is the moment map associated to\nG , and the second equation in (2.5) describes the critical points of a D-term potential.\nUnder a suitable stability condition, we would expect that for every solution to the F terms there exists a unique solution to the D-terms in the same G c orbit. This is often\nguaranteed by the Kempf-Ness theorem, but the standard version of this theorem does\nnot apply here.\nThe linearized deformations of (2.5) modulo gauge transformations by G are counted\nby harmonic three-forms, and these deformations are unobstructed [15]. Therefore the\nnumber of complex deformations of the G2 structure is given by h3 (X7 ). The K\u00e4hler\npotential on moduli space turns out to be given by [11]\n1 1\nK = \u22123 log\n2\u03c0 2 7\n\nZ\n\n|C3 + i\u03a6|2\n\n(2.8)\n\nIn this paper we will be taking a slightly different point of view however, and we will not\nbe using these expressions explicitly.\n6\n\n\fTo summarize, the main point of this subsection is that the three-form \u03a6 is an equivalent but more useful variable than the G2 metric itself. Moreover, in terms of these\nvariables the equations naturally split up into a set of first order equations which can be\ninterpreted as F -terms and D-terms.\n2.2. ALE fibrations\nNow consider a local G2 manifold X7 which is an ALE fibration over a three-manifold\nQ3 . We will usually assume that the ALE fibration has a section, and also use Q3 to denote\nthis section. On each ALE fiber, there is a natural set of two-cycles \u03b1i \u2208 H2 (ALE, Z)\nwhich intersect according to the Cartan matrix associated to the ALE, generating an\nADE root lattice \u039b. There is also a dual set of two-forms \u03c9 i .\nThe moduli space M(\u039b) of M-theory on an ALE surface is described as follows. Given\na hyperk\u00e4hler structure {I, J , K} on the ALE, we can construct a triplet of two-forms\n~ = (I \u03bd g\u03bd\u03bb , J \u03bd g\u03bd\u03bb , K\u03bd g\u03bd\u03bb ). Their periods over the \u03b1i are the parameters\n\u03a9\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nZ\n\n~i,\n~ =\u03c6\n\u03a9\n\n(2.9)\n\n\u03b1i\n\nwhich describe complex structure and K\u00e4hler moduli of the ALE. They are often called\nthe FI parameters because they appear as such in the hyperk\u00e4hler quotient construction of\nthe ALE. They naturally transform as a vector under an SO(3)R symmetry. In addition,\nwe may expand the M-theory three-form in terms of the \u03c9 i , yielding n vectors in seven\ndimensions, where n is the rank of the lattice \u039b. Since the ALE preserves half of the 32\nsupersymmetry generators, we are guaranteed to recover their fermionic superpartners as\nwell. In fact they are given by the same internal wave-functions on the ALE. So for large\nsizes of the vanishing cycles we get a supersymmetric 7d gauge theory with gauge group\nU(1)n . But what happens when the vanishing cycles are small?\nThere are additional supersymmetric states obtained from wrapping M2-branes on\n~ i |, i.e. they\nthe vanishing cycles of the ALE. Their masses are given by m \u223c mpl |N i \u03c6\nare proportional to the size of the vanishing cycle N i \u03b1i that the membrane is wrapping.\nQuantizing such a particle yields a vector multiplet, since this is the only non-gravitational\nmultiplet available in a 7d theory with 16 supercharges. Since membranes couple to C3 in\n11d, the U(1)n charges of these states are precisely those of the W -bosons of a non-abelian\nADE gauge theory with root lattice \u039b. Therefore the effective low energy dynamics of Mtheory on an ALE surface with small periods should be described by the corresponding 7d\nsupersymmetric non-abelian ADE gauge theory. Additional evidence for this statement\ncan be obtained through heterotic/type II duality.\nWhen we further fiber the ALE over Q3 , additional supersymmetries will be broken. In\nG2 compactifications, supersymmetry requires that C3 and \u03a6 are paired into a complex\nthree-form. Expanding in a basis of exceptional cycles of the ALE, locally we get n\n7\n\n\fcomplex one-forms on Q3 :\n\nZ\n\nC3 + i\u03a6 = Aj + i \u03c6j\n\n(2.10)\n\n\u03b1j\n\nSince \u03a6 describes zero modes of the metric, the one-form \u03c6j must be identified with the\ntriplet of adjoint scalars of the 7d gauge theory encountered above. One can see this\nmore explicitly from the canonical expression of \u03a6 in terms of a 7-bein. Therefore the\nthree adjoint scalars associated to each \u03b1j must be twisted to a one-form on Q3 [16]. In\nother words, in order to preserve N = 1 supersymmetry in four-dimensions, the SO(3)R~ is identified with the (dual of the) SO(3)Q structure group of\nsymmetry acting on the \u03c6\nQ3 . Equivalently, there exists a covariantly constant tensor J\u03bc\u03bd on Q3 where \u03bc transforms\nas a vector under SO(3)Q and \u03bd transforms as a vector of SO(3)R. In suitable coordinates\nwe may write J\u03bc\u03bd = i\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd .\nThus locally the ALE fibration may be described by a set of n complex one-forms.\nThere is an additional symmetry however which may be used in gluing local patches\ntogether in a global model. Namely the ALE has a diffeomorphism symmetry group which\nacts on the cycles as the ADE Weyl group. Eg. for An\u22121 ALEs this is the symmetric\ngroup Sn on n letters. This symmetry may be thought of as a residual gauge symmetry\nfrom the non-abelian gauge theory. Thus altogether we see that an ALE fibration may\nbe described by n one-forms on Q3 , with branch points across which the one-forms may\nbe permuted. Said differently, locally on Q3 we have a map from Q3 into the parameter\nspace h\u22973\nR /W of the universal unfolding of our ADE singularity. This is the essence of a\nHiggs bundle, as we will explain in more detail in section 2.4.\nConversely, given a configuration for the \u03c6i on Q3 , we may try to reconstruct an ALE\nfibration over Q3 with G2 holonomy. To first order we get\n\u03a6 = \u03a60 + \u03c6i \u2227 \u03c9 i + . . .\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere \u03a60 corresponds to the three-form for a constant ALE fibration, which certainly\nexists (it may be written down explicitly). The equations d\u03a6 = d \u2217 \u03a6 = 0 put constraints\non the \u03c6i and on the higher order terms. By analogy with Kodaira-Spencer theory for\nCalabi-Yau manifolds [17, 18], we conjecture that if the \u03c6i satisfy certain first order\nequations discussed below as well as tadpole constraints, and if Q3 has non-negative\ncurvature (so as to avoid curvature singularities at finite distance from the zero section\nthat one would otherwise likely have), then the above series may be uniquely completed\nand has a finite radius of convergence.\nSo our main point here is that the data of the ALE fibration may be described as a\nfield configuration in a supersymmetric 7d Yang-Mills theory living on Q3 . This naturally\nleads to a set of equations which we would expect the data to satisfy, in the limit that\nthe fields are slowly varying.\n\n8\n\n\f2.3. Hitchin system\nThe BPS conditions in the 7d gauge theory are given by reducing the BPS conditions\nfor ten-dimensional YM theory to seven dimensions. In 10d we have\n\u03b4\u03bb = F\u03bc\u03bd \u0393\u03bc\u03bd \u01eb = 0\n\n(2.12)\n\nTo preserve 3 + 1d Poincar\u00e9 invariance, we assume only field configurations on the 6d\ninternal space are turned on. On a Calabi-Yau manifold, this yields the well-known\nHermitian-Yang-Mills equations\nF2,0 = 0,\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd\u0304 F\u03bc\u03bd\u0304 = 0\n\n(2.13)\n\nNext we reduce these equations to 3d. This is well-understood [19, 20].\nLet us work on a local patch of Q3 . Then we can put a Calabi-Yau metric on the\ntangent bundle which is semi-flat. That is, the metric on the tangent bundle is expressed\nas ds2 = Kij (x)(dxi dxj + dy i dy j ), where K is a real K\u00e4hler potential which satisfies\na real Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, and x and y are coordinates along Q3 and along the\nbundle directions respectively. There is a natural complex structure in which the complex\ncoordinates are given by z j = xj + iy j . To perform the reduction, we assume that the\ngauge field is independent of the y coordinates, and we write the gauge field on the tangent\nbundle as\nA = Ai (x)dxi + \u03c6j (x)dy j = (A + \u03c6J )i dxi\n(2.14)\n\u221a\nwhere we used dy j = Jij dxi and wrote \u03c6Ji = \u03c6j Jij \u223c \u22121 \u03c6i . Thus A naturally defines a\ncomplexified gauge field on Q3 . We have\nF2,0 = Fjk dz j \u2227 dz k\n\n(2.15)\n\nso the condition F2,0 = 0 simply becomes the condition that the curvature of the complex\nconnection A vanishes. Decomposing in real and imaginary parts, we get the F -terms\n0 = Re F0,2 = F \u2212 [\u03c6J , \u03c6J ]\n0 = Im F0,2 = DA \u03c6J .\n\n(2.16)\n\nFurther, we have the D-terms\n0 = g \u03bc\u03bd\u0304 F\u03bc\u03bd\u0304 = i K ij Di \u03c6Jj = i DA\u2020 \u03c6J\n\n(2.17)\n\nThese equations are precisely Hitchin's equations [19, 21].\nThe equations for the Yang-Mills-Higgs fields on Q3 are the primary objects for our\npurposes. However if Q3 admits an integral affine structure, then the above isomorphism\n9\n\n\fbetween solutions of Hitchin's equations on Q3 and the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations\non T Q3 may be extended globally over Q3 . In order to do this on S 3 we would need to\nexcise a suitable graph. Since the Higgs field takes values in the cotangent bundle T \u2217 Q3 ,\nit will be useful to define dual coordinates:\nd\u1ef9j = Kjk dy k\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe K\u00e4hler form on T Q3 naturally gets identified with the standard symplectic form on\nT \u2217 Q3 :\ni\n\u03c9 = Kij dz i \u2227 dz\u0304 j = Kij dxi \u2227 dy j = dxi \u2227 d\u1ef9i\n(2.19)\n2\nFor later use, we can also dualize dx\u0303j = Kjk dxk . Then there is a natural complex structure\nalso on T \u2217 Q3 , in which the complex coordinates are given by z\u0303j = x\u0303j + i\u1ef9j , and a CalabiYau metric given by\nds2 = K ij (dx\u0303i dx\u0303j + d\u1ef9i d\u1ef9j )\n(2.20)\nFurthermore, we will see in the next section that solutions of Hitchin's equations can be\ninterpreted as Lagrangian branes in T \u2217 Q3 . This mapping between R3 -invariant solutions\nof the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations and solutions of the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations is\na real version of the Fourier-Mukai transform.\nThere are two basic type of solutions of the above Yang-Mills-Higgs equations. Solutions with [\u03c6, \u03c6] = 0 are said to be flat, and with this restriction the above data describes\na Higgs bundle. One can also have solutions with [\u03c6, \u03c6] 6= 0. These will not describe Higgs\nbundles or ALE fibrations, but rather (in the picture described in section 2.4) they will\ndescribe coisotropic branes in T \u2217 Q3 . Such configurations were proposed to be relevant for\nmoduli stabilization in [22]. In this paper we consider [\u03c6, \u03c6] = 0.\nWe would like to elaborate a bit on the interpretation of the D-terms. Let us say that\nA is an Sl(n, C) connection. Given a solution to the F -term equations, in order to write\nthe D-term equation we need to split A up into a real part A and an imaginary part \u03c6J .\nIn general this cannot be done canonically, but depends on a choice of Hermitian metric\nh, which can be thought of as an equivariant map from the universal cover\ne 3 \u2192 Hn ,\nh: Q\n\nHn = Sl(n, C)/SU(n)\n\n(2.21)\n\nGiven such a metric h, the covariant derivative DA will generally not preserve it, but it\ncan be split up as\nDA = DA + \u03c6 J\n(2.22)\nwhere DA preserves the metric. Furthermore \u03c6 is locally identified with the derivative\ne 3 \u2192 T Hn , and DA is the pull-back of the Levi-Civita connection on Hn . The\n\u2207h : T Q\nD-term equation\nDA\u2020 \u03c6 = DA\u2020 \u2207h = 0\n(2.23)\n10\n\n\fe3 \u2192 Hn . Hence the solution\nis precisely the requirement of harmonicity of h as a map Q\nof the D-term equation is also called the harmonic metric [21, 23].\n\nLet us spell this out in a little bit more detail in the abelian case. In this case\nC /U(1) = R\u22650 is the one-dimensional version of hyperbolic space, \u2207h = h\u22121 dh and\ne3 \u2192 R. The\nA = \u2212 12 h\u22121 dh. The Hermitian metric can be written as h = ef where f : Q\nD-term equation says that\nDA\u2020 \u2207h = d\u2020 df = 0\n(2.24)\n\u2217\n\ne3 , or that \u03c6 = df is a harmonic one-form on\nwhich says that f is a harmonic function on Q\nQ3 . Of course we can also argue more directly that setting A to zero locally and solving\nd\u03c6 = 0 \u21d2 \u03c6 = df implies that the D-term can be written as d\u2020 df = 0. But the above\npoint of view is useful for establishing the existence of solutions in the non-abelian case\n[21, 23].\n\nThe F -term part of the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations are the critical points of a ChernSimons functional with complex gauge group, so we identify this as the four-dimensional\nsuperpotential\nZ\n1\n2\nW =\nTr(A \u2227 dA + A \u2227 A \u2227 A)\n(2.25)\n2\n16\u03c0 Q3\n3\nIn fact we could have gotten this more directly by applying the real Fourier-Mukai transform to the holomorphic Chern-Simons functional [20]. Further the D-term is the moment\nmap for real gauge transformations, with respect to the K\u00e4hler form associated to the\nmetric\nZ\nZ\n2\n|A + i\u03c6|2\n(2.26)\n|A| =\ng(A, A) =\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nThus it can be obtained as the critical point of the D-term potential:\nVD\n\n1\n\u223c\n2\n\nZ\n\n|DA\u2020 \u03c6|2\n\n(2.27)\n\nwhen varied over possible hermitian metrics h. These are the precise analogues of the\nquantities we wrote earlier for G2 -manifolds in section 2.1, but they also incorporate\nnon-perturbative states that arise at ALE singularities.\n2.4. Spectral cover picture\nSuppose we are given a configuration for the adjoints \u03c6 satisfying [\u03c6, \u03c6] = 0. Then the\nthree components of \u03c6 may be diagonalized simultaneously, and we may associate to \u03c6\nits spectral data (i.e. its eigenvalues). Conversely, the Higgs field \u03c6 may be reconstructed\nfrom its spectral data. This picture yields A-model branes in an auxiliary Calabi-Yau\nthree-fold X = T \u2217 Q3 . In this subsection we discuss this construction in more detail.\nThere is a completely analogous construction in F -theory [24, 25] involving spectral covers\nin the canonical bundle over a complex surface. For convenience we will take Q3 = S 3 .\n11\n\n\fIn the case of An -fibrations, the spectral cover picture is more than just an auxiliary\nconstruction, since it describes the D6-branes that we see in the weak coupling IIa limit.\nThis is not a coincidence, because in the limit vol(S 3 ) \u2192 \u221e the worldvolume theory on\nthe D6-branes is well approximated by the maximally supersymmetric 7d YM theory.\nLet us briefly recap the general structure. For the moment we will restrict to An\u22121 fibrations, i.e. 7d gauge theory with gauge group G = SU(n). The twisted adjoint scalars\nof the 7d gauge theory give a section of\n\u03c6 \u2208 T \u2217 S 3 \u2297 Ad(G)\n\n(2.28)\n\nwhere G is the principle bundle with gauge group G. Consider the Hitchin map, which\ntakes the Higgs field to the coefficients of s in\ndet(sI \u2212 \u03c6) \u2208 Symn T \u2217 S 3\n\n(2.29)\n\nHere s is a local coordinate on the bundle direction of T \u2217 S 3 , and Symn is the nth symmetric\npower. The eigenvalues {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn } of \u03c6 correspond to the zero set of the above section.\nEach \u03bbi is a one-form, so has three-components. Thus the zero set defines an n-fold\ncovering of the zero section in T \u2217 S 3 . This is called the spectral cover for the fundamental\nrepresentation. We will denote it as C(E,\u03c6) , or simply CE for brevity, and the covering\nmap by pC : CE \u2192 S 3 . Since \u03c6 lives in the adjoint of SU(n), the eigenvalues add to zero\non each fiber of T \u2217 S 3 :\n\u03bb1 + . . . + \u03bbn = 0\n(2.30)\nThe gauge field A gives a flat connection on a bundle E associated to the fundamental\nrepresentation of SU(n). We can think of \u03c6 as a map\n\u03c6 : E \u2192 E \u2297 T \u2217S 3\n\n(2.31)\n\nThen on each fiber E decomposes into a sum of eigenspaces \u2295i C |ii under the action of\n\u03c6. The assignment \u03bbi \u2192 C |ii gives a line bundle LE on C called the spectral line bundle,\nand since DA \u03c6 = 0, DA commutes with the action of \u03c6 on E and therefore A gives a flat\nconnection on this line bundle. Conversely, given a spectral cover CE together with a flat\nline bundle LE , we can reconstruct the Higgs bundle on S 3 by\nE = pC\u2217 LE ,\n\n\u03c6 = pC\u2217 s\n\n(2.32)\n\nwhich yields a rank n bundle E and a map \u03c6 : E \u2192 E \u2297 T \u2217 S 3 . In order for this to be an\nSU(n) bundle, rather than a U(n) bundle, we must have\ndet(pC\u2217 LE ) = 1\n12\n\n(2.33)\n\n\fwhere 1 denotes the trivial line bundle. This puts a topological constraint on the allowed\nline bundles on the spectral cover.\nWe claim that the spectral cover yields an A-type brane in T \u2217 S 3 . In order to see this,\nwe may analyze the F - and D-terms locally. Since the gauge field A is flat, it may locally\nbe gauged away. Further, as we discussed the equation D\u03c6 = 0 splits up into n\u22121 abelian\nequations d\u03c6 = 0, where in the last equation we used \u03c6 to denote an abelian Higgs field.\nIt is well known that the condition that \u03c6 be closed is equivalent to the section being\nLagrangian with respect to the standard symplectic form on the cotangent bundle. To\nsee this, writing \u03c6 = \u03c6i dxi , the equation \u03c9|C = 0 gives\n0 = dxi \u2227 d\u1ef9i |C = dxi \u2227 d\u03c6i (x) = \u2212d(\u03c6i dxi ) = \u2212d\u03c6\n\n(2.34)\n\nThus the F -terms equations correspond precisely to the condition that the spectral cover\nis a Lagrangian submanifold of T \u2217 S 3 , together with a flat connection. It is also worth\nnoting that d\u03c6 = 0 implies that \u03c6 = df for some function f on a local patch of S 3 . Thus\neach sheet of the spectral cover may locally be represented as the graph of the differential\nof a real-valued function.\nNaively one might expect these branes to be special Lagrangian also, since this is the\nusual requirement for supersymmetric D6 branes in IIa string theory. However, this is\nnot quite the case. Locally on each sheet we have\n\u03a93,0 |C = dz\u03031 \u2227 dz\u03032 \u2227 dz\u03033 |C = det(I + iHess(f ))dx\u03031 \u2227 dx\u03032 \u2227 dx\u03033\n\n(2.35)\n\nwhere we used dz\u0303i = dx\u0303i + id\u1ef9i and \u1ef9i (x)dxi = \u03c6 = df . Requiring that the imaginary part\nvanishes identically leads to the non-linear equation\n\u2206f = det(Hess(f ))\n\n(2.36)\n\nIt's not hard to see where this apparent discrepancy comes from. The right hand side\ncomes from a higher derivative correction to the two-derivative SYM theory. Indeed one\nmay write a similar non-linear correction term for 10d SYM theory, which is related to\n(2.36) by the Fourier-Mukai transform1 [20]:\n\u03c9\u2227\u03c9\u2227F =F \u2227F \u2227F\n\n(2.37)\n\nIn the large volume limit in which we are working, such higher derivative corrections are\nparametrically small and can be neglected to first approximation. Thus in our approximation, D6-branes in type IIa and more generally spectral covers of ALE fibrations/Higgs\n1\n\nThis is for the abelian case; the non-abelian case is apparently not yet completely understood\n\n13\n\n\fbundles are described by 'harmonic' Lagrangian branes in T \u2217 S 3 , rather than special Lagrangian branes.\nIn the IIa context it is natural to conjecture that the 'harmonic' Lagrangian flows to\na unique special Lagrangian under mean curvature flow [26]. In the M-theory context\nhowever it seems inappropriate to look at special Lagrangians. The reason is that in\nthe IIa context we have two expansion parameters in 4d, namely gs and ls /RKK , but\nin the present context there is only a single expansion parameter (namely 1/vol(S 3 ) in\nPlanck units), and so the higher order corrections discussed above can compete at the\nsame order in this expansion parameter with other corrections such as KK loops. It\nwould be physically incorrect to include only one type of correction and ignore the other\ncontributions at the same order in the expansion parameter.\nFor applications to M-theory phenomenology we are interested in E8 Higgs bundles.\nThe spectral cover in this case can get quite complicated, but fortunately phenomenological considerations dictate that we only consider non-trivial configurations for an SU(n)\nsubbundle (so that the Higgs field breaks the E8 gauge group to the commutant of SU(n);\nthe unbroken part of the gauge group is called the GUT group). In particular we would\nlike to consider the case n = 5, which yields an SU(5) GUT group. The E8 spectral cover\nhas 248 sheets and decomposes into several pieces, according to the decomposition2\n248 = (24, 1) + (1, 24) + (5, 10) + (5, 10) + (10, 5) + (10, 5)\n\n(2.38)\n\nof E8 under SU(5)GU T \u00d7 SU(5)H . The most important is the spectral cover for the\nfundamental representation of SU(5)H , which determines all the others uniquely. This\ncover intersects each fiber of T \u2217 S 3 in five points \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb5 , with\n\u03bb1 + . . . + \u03bb5 = 0\n\n(2.39)\n\nHere addition is defined in the obvious way in each fiber. In the language of ALE fibrations, the \u03bbi 's correspond to certain F I parameters of the E8 ALE using the dictionary\ndescribed in section 2.2. Using the labelling in figure 1, we may take the \u03bbi to describe\nthe size parameters of the following exceptional cycles:\n|1i = \u03b14\n|2i = \u03b13 + \u03b14\n|3i = \u03b12 + \u03b13 + \u03b14\n\n|4i = \u03b11 + \u03b12 + \u03b13 + \u03b14\n|5i = \u03b1\u2212\u03b8 + \u03b11 + \u03b12 + \u03b13 + \u03b14\n\n(2.40)\n\nThe sizes of the cycles {\u03b15 , . . . , \u03b18 } are taken to be zero, generating an SU(5) GUT group,\nand all other cycles are obtained as linear combinations. As we will discuss in more detail\nlater, when one of the \u03bbi 's goes to zero, i.e. when the cover intersects the zero section,\n2\nThe cover corresponding to (24, 1) further splits into two pieces, a cover of degree 20 and a four-fold\nmultiple of the zero section.\n\n14\n\n\f\u03b18\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b8\n\n\u03b11\n\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b13\n\n\u03b14\n\n3\n6\n\n\u03b15\n\n4\n\n2\n\n\u03b16\n\n\u03b17\n\nFigure 1: The extended E8 Dynkin diagram and Dynkin indices.\none may get a chiral or anti-chiral field in the 10 localized here. Another piece of the\nE8 cover corresponds to the anti-symmetric representation of SU(5)H . The cover C\u039b2 E\nintersects each fiber in\n\u03bbi + \u03bbj ,\ni < j.\n(2.41)\nand we will see later that when this cover intersects the zero section, we may get a chiral\nor anti-chiral field in the 5 localized there.\nTo summarize, we've gone through the following chain:\nG2 metric and flat C3\nl\nd(C3 + i\u03a6) = d\u2217 \u03a6 = 0\n\u2240\n\n(2.42)\n\nHiggs bundle\nl\nh-Lag branes in T \u2217 Q3\nThe conjecture is that we can also go in the reverse, i.e. given solutions to Hitchin's\nequations with [\u03c6, \u03c6] = 0 one may reconstruct solutions to d\u03a6 = d\u2217 \u03a6 = 0. This must be\ncorrect if the 7d gauge theory is to give an accurate description of M-theory dynamics on\nan ALE singularity, as is expected physically for large S 3 .\n2.5. Non-compact branes\nWe claim that in order to get interesting solutions, we have to allow for certain source\nterms in the YMH equations. To see this, let us assume that we do not have any source\nterms. Now flat connections are characterized by their monodromies, and since \u03c01 (S 3 ) = 1\n15\n\n\fany flat connection is equivalent to the trivial connection. This is in accord with the\nstatement that branes wrapped on the minimal three-sphere in T \u2217 S 3 do not form bound\nstates [27].\nOne may get non-trivial solutions by instead quotienting the S 3 by a freely acting\ndiscrete group \u0393, so that \u03c01 (S 3 /\u0393) will be non-trivial. However the non-trivial bound\nstates one can make are still not of the type we want. We need the discrete group \u0393 to be\nfreely acting, and in this case must be finite (basically \u0393 is a product of ADE subgroups\nof SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R acting on S 3 ). Therefore the monodromies must be contained in\nthe compact part of the complexified gauge group. This means that Wilson lines for the\ngauge field can be turned on but the Higgs field has zero expectation value. In order to\nget more interesting solutions with a non-trivial Higgs field we need to do something else.\nIn order to get interesting solutions we need to allow for non-compact flavour branes,\ni.e. source terms in the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations. This is completely analogous to\nthe meromorphic Higgs bundles appearing in local F -theory models [24, 25]. One may\nalso see how this arises by applying heterotic/M-theory duality to heterotic models. Let\nus take for instance a heterotic model with the spin connection embedded in the gauge\nconnection. In a suitable limit, the heterotic Calabi-Yau three-fold admits a Lagrangian\nT 3 -fibration over S 3 . The Wilson lines of the bundle along the T 3 fibers form a covering\nof the S 3 , which consist of three-points on the generic dual T 3 fiber. This is the heterotic\npicture of the spectral cover that we discussed, for the special case of the tangent bundle.\nHowever over special subsets in S 3 the cover may wrap some of the circles of the T 3 fibration. Eg. over a graph in S 3 it may contain a T 2 \u2282 T 3 , and over special points in\nS 3 it may contain the whole T 3 . As in F -theory/heterotic duality, we expect that in a\nsuitable limit this data is equivalent at the level of F -terms to a degenerate K3 fibration\nover S 3 with a section of E6 ALE singularities, although for M-theory/heterotic duality\nthis is of course not established. Taking the local limit, we should take the size of the\ndual T 3 fibers to infinity in the heterotic picture. This gives the picture advocated above\nof a Higgs field which is generically finite, but may blow up over a special subset of S 3 .\n\n16\n\n\f3. The effective theory\nIn the previous section, we reformulated the problem of constructing phenomenological\nM-theory compactifications in terms of Higgs bundles and spectral covers. In this section\nwe explain how the low energy degrees of freedom and their interactions arise from the\ncompactified Yang-Mills theory. Qualitatively this is already largely understood in the\nliterature, but in order to construct models and carry out the computations explicitly\nwe need some new tools. Therefore we will reformulate some old results in our present\nlanguage and introduce Morse theory in order to relate the spectrum to more readily\ncomputable quantities.\n3.1. Chiral matter\nIntuitively, chiral matter will be localized on some kind of solitonic configuration of\nthe Higgs field. At the center of such a soliton, one of the eigenvalues of the Higgs field is\ngoing to zero. Thus we would like to analyze the Dirac equation in such a solitonic background. In non-degenerate situations, there is only a single eigen-value or combination of\neigen-values of the Higgs field going to zero. Therefore in the non-degenerate case it is\nsufficient to consider abelian Higgs fields only, and we will assume this through much of\nthe discussion below. As we will discuss in the next subsection however, there are some\nglobal effects which may require us to look at the full non-abelian field.\nRecall that locally we can set the gauge field to zero, and write \u03c6 = df . Therefore the\nzeroes of \u03c6 are sometimes also called 'critical points'. We will now describe how this gives\nrise to chiral matter. This is essentially already discussed in the literature, particularly\n[28, 29] for the present setting, but will be reformulated somewhat to fit our purposes.\nIn order to calculate the spectrum, we need to solve a Dirac equation with a background\nHiggs field turned on. Following [30] we will rescale the Higgs field by a positive real\nnumber t \u223c 1/~ and calculate the spectrum in a 1/t expansion.\n\nIt is convenient to think of the spinors in the 7d Yang-Mills theory from a tendimensional point of view. The ten-dimensional 16 decomposes under SO(3, 1) \u00d7 SO(6)\nas\n(2, 1, 4) + (1, 2, 4\u0304)\n(3.1)\nwhich are further related by the Majorana condition. The 4 and 4\u0304 of SO(6) may be\nidentified with (0, p) forms, with p even odd for 4 and p even for 4\u0304. Each breaks up\nunder SO(3)Q \u00d7 SO(3)R as a (2, 2), but they have different eigen-values under \u03936 . We\ncan denote them as (2, 2)\u00b1 according to their \u03936 eigenvalue.\nAs we discussed, due to twisting needed to maintain N = 1 supersymmetry, we can\nidentify SO(3)R with SO(3)Q3 . This diagonal SO(3) may be identified with the real\n17\n\n\fsubgroup SO(3) \u2282 SU(3) of the Calabi-Yau holonomy group fixed by an anti-holomorphic\ninvolution, which gives another way to see the twisting. In any case, our spinors are\nfunctions of xi and transform as spinor bilinears on Q3 = S 3 . As is well known, such\nbilinears can be identified with differential forms on Q3 , i.e. they may be identified with\nsections of\n\u03c8 \u2208 Ap (Q3 , C) \u2297 Ad(G),\np = 0, 1\n(3.2)\nwhere G is the principal bundle with gauge group G. Note that this matches with the\nbosonic field content. In order to relate this to the description above, given a p-form\nwave-function \u03c8 we may associate with it a (0, p)-form by replacing dxi \u2192 dz\u0304 i in \u03c8, and\nand a (p, 0)-form by replacing dxi \u2192 dz i in \u03c8 \u2217 . By Serre duality (i.e. taking the complex\nconjugate and contracting with \u03a93,0 ) we may relate the (p, 0)-forms to (0, 3 \u2212 p)-forms\nwhich transform in the same representation. The reason for replacing \u03c8 \u2217 by its Serre dual\nis that the Dirac operator acts more naturally in this basis. In terms of the original p-form\n\u03c8 this is just the real Hodge \u2217-operator \u03c8 \u2192 \u2217\u03c8 on Q3 without complex conjugation. So\nit is natural to allow differential forms (3.2) for all values of p, with equivalent degrees of\nfreedom related by the \u2217-operator. Tracing back to (3.1) we see that chiral fermions are\nnaturally paired with odd p-forms and anti-chiral fermions are paired with even p-forms.\nWe assume that we have a gauge group G which is broken to a subgroup H by turning\non an abelian component of the Higgs field. We decompose the adjoint representation of\nG under H \u00d7 U(1) as\nAd(G) = Ad(H)0 + Rq (H) + R\u2212q (H) + 10\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe worldvolume gauge fields can be set to zero locally. The Dirac operator acting on\nthe spinors in the R-representation is then given by\niQt = i\n\nX\n\n(\u2202j + t\u2202j f )(a\u2020j + aj )\n\n(3.4)\n\nj=1,2,3\n\nHere we set q \u2192 1 because its precise value is inconsequential, only its sign is important.\nThe Dirac operator acting on spinors in the R\u0304-representation is given by interchanging\nf \u2192 \u2212f . When identifying the spinors with forms, the Clifford algebra may be represented as a\u2020i = \u2227dxi and ai = \u0131\u2202/\u2202xi , so we get\nQt = dt + d\u2020t\n\n(3.5)\n\ndt = d + t df \u2227\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere\nThe operator Qt is exactly the operator discussed at length in [30], so we will borrow from\nthe discussion there.\n18\n\n\f\u03c8\n\u03c6\n\nFigure 2: Fermion zero mode localized on a defect.\n\nThe operator Qt may be thought of as a supercharge for supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics with target space M. The hamiltonian of this system is given by\nQ2t = Ht = \u2206 + t2 (df )2 +\n\nX\ni,j\n\nt\n\nD2f\n[a\u2020i , aj ]\nDxi Dxj\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere \u2206 denotes the usual Laplace-Beltrami operator. For large t, the Hamiltonian is\ndominated by the potential energy |df |2. In order to minimize the potential energy for\nlarge t, the eigenfunctions must be peaked around the critical points of f . Therefore we\nmay focus on a single critical point and approximate f by a quadratic potential. Up to\ncoordinate transformations, f may locally be written as:\nf=\n\n1 X\npi x2i\n2 i=1,2,3\n\n(3.8)\n\nThe pi , i = 1, 2, 3 are real constants. They are all non-zero because we assumed that the\ncritical points are non-degenerate. Then the Higgs field near the critical point is given by\n\u03c6 = df =\n\nX\n\npi xi dxi\n\n(3.9)\n\ni=1,2,3\n\nThe D-term equation put a restriction on the pi :\nTr Hess(f ) = p1 + p2 + p3 = 0\n\n(3.10)\n\nUsing coordinates in which f takes the diagonal form (3.8), we may clearly use separation of variables. Thus we concentrate on one variable xi temporarily and finally tensor\nthe wave functions together. Then we have a standard domain wall set-up (see Figure 2).\nThe Dirac equation becomes\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u2202\n+ tp1 x1 \u03c81+ = 0,\n\u2202x1\n\n\u0014\n19\n\n\u0015\n\u2202\n\u2212 tp1 x1 \u03c81\u2212 = 0\n\u2202x1\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fThe local solution is\n2\n\n\u03c81\u00b1 (x) = e\u00b1tp1 x1 /2 \u01eb\u00b1\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere \u01eb+ = 1 and \u01eb\u2212 = dx1 . Inspecting the exponential factor, we see that either \u03c81+ is\nnormalizable and \u03c81\u2212 is not, or vice versa. The normalizable solution is physically sensible\nand the non-normalizable one should be discarded. Which solution is normalizable clearly\ndepends only on the sign of p1 .\nTensoring together with \u03c82 and \u03c83 and a four-dimensional chiral or anti-chiral spinor\n\u03c7 , we get the full wave function:\n\u00b1\n\n\u03c7\u00b1 \u03c81\u00b1 \u03c82\u00b1 \u03c83\u00b1 \u2297 R(H) \u2208 A\u2217(Q3 ; C) \u2297 R(H)\n\n(3.13)\n\nAs we discussed, not all of these combinations are allowed. The four dimensional chirality\nis correlated with the degree of the form, which now becomes the number of negative\neigenvalues. The number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian at an isolated critical\npoint is called the Morse index. The cases of Morse index zero or three (i.e. (+, +, +)\nand (\u2212, \u2212, \u2212)) are ruled out by the D-terms, since a harmonic function can not have local\nminima or maxima. Therefore up to permutations, we have Morse index one (+, +, \u2212)\nwhich gives a chiral fermion, and Morse index two (+, \u2212, \u2212) which gives an anti-chiral\nfermion.\nIn addition, we should analyze the Dirac equation for the remaining pieces in the\ndecomposition of Ad(G), namely Ad(H)0 and 10 . The corresponding zero modes are not\nlocalized at the critical points and we need some global information. In this case the\nDirac operator is just given by the exterior differential, and the zero modes are in oneto-one correspondence with Betti numbers. From Ad(H)0 we get a gaugino transforming\nin Ad(H), and b1 (Q) adjoint chirals. From the 10 we get H 1 (C) moduli (where C is the\nspectral cover). This concludes the derivation of the massless spectrum to all orders in\nthe 1/t expansion.\nAs a simple example, consider the local unfolding of an SU(6) singularity to an SU(5)\nsingularity, considered in [29, 31]. That is, we will consider an A5 ALE surface fibered\nover R3 , such that for ~x = ~0 all the vanishing cycles are zero size and we have an A5\nsingularity, and such that for ~x 6= 0 the ALE is partially resolved, but we still have an A4\nsingularity. Then we need to turn on an abelian Higgs field. Under SU(5) \u00d7 U(1)Q , the\nadjoint of SU(6) decomposes as\nAd(SU(6)) = Ad(SU(5)) + 5 + 5\u0304 + 1\n\n(3.14)\n\nand so we expect a chiral fermion at ~x = 0 which transforms as a 5 or 5 under the\nunbroken SU(5) gauge symmetry. Let us first phrase the configuration in our current\nlanguage, and then compare with [29].\n\n20\n\n\f\u03b1\u2212\u03b8\nA5=SU(6)\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03b11\n\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b13\n\n\u03b14\n\n\u03b15\n\nFigure 3: The extended A5 Dynkin diagram and Dynkin indices.\nOur Higgs field will be proportional to a Cartan generator U(1)Q which is embedded\nin SU(6) as \u03c9Q = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, \u22125). In terms of the canonical basis \u03c9k satisfying\n[\u03c9k , \u03b1l ] = \u03b4kl\n\n(3.15)\n\nthis corresponds to \u03c9Q = 6\u03c95 . To each node we can associate an abelian Higgs field \u03c6k \u03c9k ,\nwhose three components are the three FI parameters for the corresponding cycle \u03b1k . They\nsatisfy the constraint\nd\u2212\u03b8 \u03c6\u2212\u03b8 + . . . + d5 \u03c6\u03b15 = 0\n(3.16)\nwhere dk are the Dynkin indices. In the present case, the dk are all equal to one. (This\ndescription is redundant because we can always use this relation to eliminate \u03c6\u2212\u03b8 , but it\nbecomes quite convenient for non-abelian Higgs field VEVs). Now we set\n\u03c6\u03b15 = \u2212\u03c6\u2212\u03b8 = df,\n\nf\u221d\n\n3\nX\n\npi x2i\n\n(3.17)\n\ni=1\n\nSince {\u03c6\u03b11 , .., \u03c6\u03b14 } are all kept zero, the corresponding cycles \u03b1k are all kept at zero size,\nand anPSU(5) singularity is preserved. This satisfies the F -terms, and using the metric\nds2 = dx2i on R3 it also satisfies the D-terms provided p1 +p2 +p3 = 0. By our previous\nanalysis, we get a chiral fermion localized at ~x = ~0, in the 5 if p1 p2 p3 > 0 or in the 5 if\np1 p2 p3 < 0.\nThis description agrees with the hyperk\u00e4hler quotient construction of [29]. Their D~ = (a, b\u0304)/U(1), where the U(1) acts with charge one on a and b.\nterms are given by D\nThe authors of [29] choose the unfolding ~x = (a, b)/U(1), i.e. we changed the sign of one\n~ (changing the Morse index from zero to one) and then identified\nof the components of D\n3\nthe image with R . Thus this agrees with our claims above except for an inconsequential\nrescaling in the metric on R3 . Additional constructions along the lines of [29] can be\nfound in [32, 33].\nOf course we want a gap between the massless modes and the KK modes of the 7d\ngauge theory, so we are not interested in fibering over R3 but over a compact threemanifold like S 3 or S 3 /\u0393. Then there will necessarily be higher order terms in f and\n21\n\n\fadditional critical points. Our calculation was not exact, and in fact there are corrections\nto Ht exponentially suppressed in t which may lift some of the zero modes we found.\nThese corrections are the topic of section 3.3.\nWe can also state the formula for chiral matter in terms of the spectral cover in the\nauxiliary Calabi-Yau T \u2217 S 3 . Locally we can describe a sheet by the graph of df . A critical\npoint of f corresponds to an intersection point between the graph of df and the zero\nsection, and the sign of the intersection is just (\u22121)p where p is the Morse index. Thus\nthe statement is that one must count with sign the number of intersection points of a\nharmonic Lagrangian brane C with the zero section C0 :\nN\u03c7 (R) = #(C0 \u2229 C)\u2212 ,\n\nN\u03c7 (R\u0304) = #(C0 \u2229 C)+\n\n(3.18)\n\nConsider for instance E8 models broken to SU(5) by an SU(5) Higgs field. The SU(5)\nHiggs field can be encoded in a Lagrangian brane CE in T \u2217 S 3 which is a five-fold covering of the zero section, or in a ten-fold covering C\u039b2 E associated to the anti-symmetric\nrepresentation. When CE intersects the zero section, we have \u03bbi \u2192 0 for some i and the\nsymmetry is locally enhanced to SO(10). Using the decomposition\nAd(SO(10)) = Ad(SU(5)) + 10 + 10 + 1\n\n(3.19)\n\nthe chirals in the 10 are counted by the number of negative intersections between CE and\nthe zero section. Similarly when C\u039b2 E intersects the zero section, \u03bbi + \u03bbj \u2192 0 for some\ni 6= j and the symmetry is locally enhanced to SU(6), i.e. it locally looks like the example\ndiscussed above. Thus the number of 5 or 5's is counted by the intersection points of the\ncover C\u039b2 E with the zero section. However pairs of chirals and anti-chirals may still be\nlifted through instanton effects, leading to the quantum intersection theory of Lagrangian\nbranes in T \u2217 S 3 .\n3.2. Abelian solutions\nRecall that in order to get non-trivial solutions to Hitchin's equations on S 3 or S 3 /\u0393,\nwe have to allow for non-compact branes, i.e. we have to allow for singularities in the\nHiggs field. We will generally assume that these singularities are located on a graph \u2206 in\nS 3 , although one could consider more general situations. Then locally we may choose a\ncoordinate r transverse to the graph, and an angle \u03b8 in the plane transverse to the graph.\nIn the abelian case, the local behaviour as r \u2192 0 is\nA \u223c \u03b1d\u03b8\n\u03c6 \u223c \u03b2d log r + \u03b3d\u03b8\n\n(3.20)\n\nThe parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are boundary data that we have to specify. In this section we\ndiscuss the special case when there is no monodromy of the gauge and Higgs fields, i.e.\n\u03b1 + i\u03b3 = 0, and we return to the general case later.\n22\n\n\fWe excise a small tubular neighbourhood of \u2206 from S 3 , which therefore becomes a\nmanifold-with-boundary which we will denote by M. Then the F -terms on M simply\nread\nd\u03c6 = 0\n(3.21)\nand since the Higgs field carries no monodromy (\u03b3 = 0), we may express \u03c6 = df for a\nglobally defined function f . The D-terms read\nd\u2217 df = 0\n\n(3.22)\n\non the complement of \u2206. In fact it is simpler in this case to think of \u03b2 as a charge density\nalong \u2206, and write the D-terms as a Poisson equation on S 3\nd\u2217 df = \u03b2\n\n(3.23)\n\nThe above equations are of course very familiar. We are simply dealing with an electrostatics problem, with the Higgs field \u03c6 playing the role of the (dual of the) electric field, \u03b2\nplaying the role of a charge density along the graph, and f = log h playing the role of the\nelectro-static potential. Thus we can solve this problem in the standard way, by using the\nGreen's function for the Laplacian. There is a single consistency constraint that needs to\nbe satisfied: using the divergence theorem, we get\n0=\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\nd \u03c6=\n\nM\n\nZ\n\n\u2202M\n\n\u03c6*\u03bd\n\n(3.24)\n\nand hence the total flux through the boundary must vanish, which means that the total\n'charge' on S 3 must vanish (Gauss's law). Accordingly there must be positive and negative\ncharges, and we can split up the graph \u2206 as \u2206+ \u222a \u2206\u2212 which are positively and negatively\ncharged respectively. Let us denote the Green's function for the Laplacian as G(x, y).\nThe solution to the BPS equations is given by\n\u03c6 = df,\n\nf (y) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd3 x g \u03b2(x)G(x, y)\n\n(3.25)\n\nS3\n\n3.3. Instanton corrections and Morse cohomology\nIn the above we saw that one may construct abelian solutions by solving a simple\nelectro-statics problem. However even though we know there exists a solution satisfying\nboth the F -terms and the D-terms, one can learn much by imposing only the F -term\nequations. That is, in the following we will assume that \u03c6 is closed but not necessarily\n23\n\n\fharmonic. Recall that the spectrum of massless charged chiral and anti-chiral matter is\nrelated to the critical points of \u03c6. As we will now discuss, the massless spectrum may\nactually be deduced using purely combinatorial methods and is common to all solutions\nof the F -terms, independent of whether \u03c6 is harmonic.\nLet us denote the set of critical points of index i by Criti (f ). It is a well-known fact\nthat on a compact manifold the number of critical points of Morse index i is bounded\nbelow by the i-th Betti number:\n# Criti (f ) \u2265 hi (M)\n\n(3.26)\n\nThis is the weak form of the Morse inequalities, one of the central results of Morse\ntheory (a brief review may be found in appendix A). In the present setting we also have\nboundaries, and we really get a bound in terms of betti numbers for relative cohomology.\nFor simplicity let us temporarily ignore this issue. The point is that we get a lower bound\non the massless spectrum in terms of topological data.\nNow it turns out the situation is actually much better than that. The calculation of\nthe massless spectrum in section 3.1 was exact to all orders in a 1/t expansion, but may\nstill be corrected by instantons. Once we take these quantum effects into account, we\nwill find that the massless spectrum is in fact exactly computed by the Betti numbers. In\nother words, we may read of the massless spectrum just from the topology of M, which\nmay be computed by purely combinatorial methods. Following [30] (see also [34]), we will\nnow briefly explain how instantons correct the computation.\nThe potential energy function V \u223c |df |2 has multiple critical points. However it is not\ngenerally true that the states we found at each critical point are all true ground states.\nWe haven't yet accounted for the possibility of tunnelling. To see this, we consider two\ncritical points p, q and their associated ground states |pi , |qi and compute the amplitude\nhq|Qt pi. The effective Lagrangian of the 7d SYM describing excitations along M in the\nrepresentation R is that of supersymmetric quantum mechanics on M:\n1\n1\ni\n1\nL = (dx)2 \u2212 t2 (df )2 + \u03c8\u0304(D + tD 2 f )\u03c8 + R\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\n2\n2\n2\n4\n\n(3.27)\n\nThe fermions may be thought of as the operators ai \u223c \u2227dxi encountered earlier. Ignoring\nthe fermions, the Euclidean action is given by:\nZ\nZ\nZ\n2\n2\n2\n2 SE =\nd\u03bb (dx) + (tdf ) = d\u03bb(dx \u00b1 tdf ) \u2213 t d\u03bbdf\n\u2265 t |f (q) \u2212 f (p)|\n\n(3.28)\n\nwhere \u03bb denotes Euclidean time. The potential is then turned upside down, and there\nare instanton solutions:\n\u2202f\n\u2202xi\n= \u00b1tg ij\n(3.29)\nd\u03bb\n\u2202xi\n24\n\n\fwith x(\u03bb \u2192 \u2212\u221e) = q, x(\u03bb \u2192 +\u221e) = p. These are gradient flow trajectories that connect\ncritical points p and q. For instanton contributions to dt we want the minus sign above.\nEach such instanton contributes\nhq|dt |pi \u223c\n\nZ\n\ndx0 d\u03c8\u03040\n\ndetF\n\n1\n\n1/2\ndetB\n\ndt |class e\u2212 2 t(f (q)\u2212f (p))\n\n(3.30)\n\nHere x0 and \u03c8\u03040 denote the bosonic and fermionic zero modes of the instanton; detB and\ndetF denote the bosonic and fermionic fluctuation determinants; and we evaluate dt on\nthe instanton solution.\nTo get the amplitude, we need to compute the one loop fluctuation determinant. In\nsupersymmetric theories, the determinants for the non-zero modes of the bosons and\nfermions cancel, but there are zero modes. For an instanton connecting two critical\npoints whose Morse index differs by one, there is one bosonic zero mode (for the broken\ntranslation invariance in Euclidean time) and one fermionic zero mode (for the broken\nsupersymmetry generator). More generally, the number zero modes is given by the Morse\nindex of p minus the Morse index of q. Since the operator dt = \u03c8\u0304(\u2202x + \u2202f ) soaks up\nexactly one bosonic and one fermionic zero mode, the instanton only contributes if the\ndifference in the Morse indices is equal to one.\nWe further need to know the coefficient, in particular the sign of the coefficient. This\nis slightly subtle since the coefficient is proportional to 1/t, so we simply state the result.\nConsider the subspace Vp of the tangent space at p on which the Hessian is negative\ndefinite. Its dimension is given by the Morse index of p and it carries an orientation\ninduced by the differential form |pi. Let ~v denote a vector tangent to the gradient flow\ntrajectory, and Vp\u22a5 the subspace of Vp orthogonal to ~v . It carries an orientation induced\nby the contraction of |pi with ~v . At q we have an analogous subspace Vq with orientation\ninduced by |qi. Now we transport Vp\u22a5 along the gradient flow trajectory to q. If the\norientation agrees with Vq we use the plus sign, and if they disagree we use the minus\nsign.\nHence we deduce that non-perturbatively in 1/t, the action of dt on the would-be zero\nmodes has the following correction:\ndt |pi =\n\nX\n\n1\n\nC i+1 (M )\n\nn(p, q)e\u2212 2 t(f (q)\u2212f (p)) |qi\n\n(3.31)\n\n1\n\nwhere n(p, q) counts with sign the number of trajectories. By rescaling |pi \u2192 e 2 tf (p) |pi,\n1\n|qi \u2192 e 2 tf (q) |qi we can get rid of the exponential factors, and hence we simply get\ndt |pi =\n\nX\n\nC i+1 (M )\n\n25\n\nn(p, q) |qi\n\n(3.32)\n\n\fSince d2t = 0, it is a boundary operator. The actual zero modes are those which are also\nannihilated by dt and d\u2020t , so the true zero modes are in one-one correspondence with the\ncohomology of dt . This is the Morse complex.\nIt's not hard to recover these instantons in the other pictures we have been using. In\nthe ALE fibration picture, the gradient flow trajectories connecting critical points can be\ninterpreted as membrane instantons. Let's assume assume for instance that we have an\nA1 ALE space fibered over S 3 , and our line bundle is embedded as the diagonal generator\nin SU(2), generically breaking the SU(2) \u2192 U(1). Then in the ALE sitting over the\ncritical point of f , an S 2 shrinks to zero size and the U(1) gets enhanced to SU(2) due\nto a massless M2 brane wrapping the S 2 . Now let us take this S 2 and transport it along\nthe gradient flow trajectory to the other critical point. In this way we trace out an S 3\ninside the ALE fibration which projects to the gradient flow trajectory in the base Q3 ,\nand there is a membrane instanton obtained by wrapping an M2-brane on this S 3 . The\naction of this instanton is proportional to the area of the S 3 , which we can find because\nthe S 3 is a calibrated cycle. Recalling that \u03a6 \u223c \u03a60 + tdf \u2227 \u03c9, we get:\nZ\nZ\nvol =\n\u03a6 \u223c\nt\u2202\u03bb f d\u03bb \u223c t (f (q) \u2212 f (p))\n(3.33)\nS3\n\nThis agrees with the action of the gradient flow instanton. Clearly this generalizes to more\ncomplicated ALE fibrations. Note that we should not interpret these M2 instantons as\nsaying that our gauge theory breaks down, we are still describing a tunnelling effect in\nthe 7d gauge theory.\nWe can also interpret these instantons in the spectral cover picture. It will not come as\na surprise that they lift to disk instantons. To see this, consider a disk stretching between\nthe zero section and the Lagrangian brane defined by the function f , which projects to\nthe gradient flow trajectory on S 3 between the critical points p and q. Its area, measured\nwith respect to the standard symplectic form on T \u2217 S 3 , is given by\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03bb\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\ndx x|t\u2207f | = t(f (q) \u2212 f (p))\n2\n\n(3.34)\n\nand therefore the action of the disk instanton also agrees with the action of the gradient\nflow instanton.\nNow the beauty of the Morse complex is that it reconstructs the ordinary cohomology\nof the underlying manifold, i.e. we have\n\u2217\n\u2217\nHM\norse (M, f ) = H (M, R)\n\n(3.35)\n\nOne way to understand this isomorphism is by noticing [30] that our differential operator\nis related to the ordinary exterior differential by a similarity transformation\ndt = e\u2212tf detf = d + t df \u2227\n26\n\n(3.36)\n\n\fThus the betti numbers are independent of t. In the limit t \u2192 \u221e we obtain the Morse\ncomplex, and in the limit t \u2192 0 we recover the definition of the ordinary de Rham\ncohomology.\nThere is also a version of this isomorphism for manifolds with boundary, which is the\ncase relevant for us. Recall that we effectively have boundaries where the Morse function\n(or electro-static potential) becomes infinite. We will assume the boundary may be split\nup into disjoint positively charged and negatively charged pieces\n\u2202M = \u2202 + M \u222a \u2202 \u2212 M\n\n(3.37)\n\nThen the Morse complex reconstructs the relative cohomology\n\u2217\n\u2217\n+\nHM\norse (M, f ) = H (M, \u2202 M).\n\n(3.38)\n\nActually in order for Morse theory with boundaries to be well-defined and reproduce the\nrelative cohomology, we must ensure that the gradient flow trajectories connecting critical\npoints do not hit the boundary. This is automatically the case for the harmonic solutions\nthat satisfy the D-term equations. In the electro-statics analogy, the critical points are\nthe points where a test charge would experience zero force. The gradient flow trajectories\ndescribe the possible trajectories of a positive test charge. A trajectory connecting two\ncritical points cannot hit a boundary \u2013 the potential energy is minimized at a boundary\nand the test charge cannot climb back out.\nTherefore we conclude that the massless matter content depends only on topological\nproperties of the configuration and is independent of the explicit solution to the D-term\nequation. The massless matter content is simply given by the ranks of the relative cohomology groups:\nN\u03c7 (R) = h1 (M, \u2202 + M),\n\nN\u03c7\u0304 (R) = h2 (M, \u2202 + M)\n\n(3.39)\n\nwhere \u2202 + M is the boundary of M where the Morse function is increasing, i.e. where the\npositive charges are located. Therefore the computation of the spectrum is reduced to\na purely combinatorial problem involving triangulations or cell complexes. In particular\nthe net number in the representation R is simply given by\nnet chiral(R) = \u03c7(M, \u2202 + M)\n\n(3.40)\n\nAs we will discuss later, this formula holds much more generally.\nMore generally we may have multiple abelian Higgs fields. Suppose there are two,\nwith associated Morse functions fa , fb . Let us denote the boundaries as\n\u2202a = \u2202a+ \u2212 \u2202a\u2212\n27\n\n(3.41)\n\n\fwhere we used the minus sign to indicate that there are negative charges located on \u2202a\u2212 .\nWe will assume again that positive and negative boundaries do not intersect, and we will\nalso assume for convenience that the charge density along the boundary is uniform. Then\nit's not hard to see that for a general linear combination qa fa + qb fb , the boundary is given\nby\n\u2202qa ,qb = qa \u2202a+ \u2212 qa \u2202a\u2212 + qb \u2202b+ \u2212 qb \u2202b\u2212\n(3.42)\nDepending on how the Higgs fields are embedded into a non-abelian group G, one will be\ninterested in the critical points of various linear combinations of fa and fb . These linear\ncombinations depend on the U(1) \u00d7 U(1) charges (qa , qb ) of the multiplets appearing in\nthe decomposition of the adjoint of G under H \u00d7 U(1)a \u00d7 U(1)b . In each case we have\nN\u03c7 (qa , qb ) = H 1 (M, qa fa + qb fb ) = H 1 (M, \u2202q+a ,qb )\n\n(3.43)\n\nSo far, our results were stated as certain properties of the Higgs field. We may also\nrestate some of the results in the spectral cover description, which yields a more geometric\npicture. We have already seen that critical points correspond to intersections of components of the spectral cover with the zero section. We have also seem that gradient flow\ntrajectories lift to disk instantons in T \u2217 S 3 . Therefore the instanton corrected spectrum is\ncomputed by the Floer cohomology groups\nHF \u2217(C0 , CE )\n\n(3.44)\n\nwhere we used C0 to denote the zero section. Indeed it is well known in the literature that\nFloer cohomology in the cotangent bundle coincides with Morse/Novikov cohomology on\nthe base manifold [35, 36, 37].\nThe analysis of the charged chiral spectrum implies that if # Criti (f ) > hi (M, \u2202 + M),\nthen there are chiral fields in the spectrum whose masses are exponentially suppressed\ncompared to the GUT or KK scale:\n1\nGU T\n\n\u2212\u03b1\n\nM2 \u223c e\n\n2\nMGU\nT\n\n(3.45)\n\nThese massive modes modify the running of the gauge couplings below the GUT scale\n(which may be identified with the KK scale up to threshold corrections), and may provide\nchannels for proton decay. The GUT breaking mechanism of [38] using discrete Wilson\nlines in fact requires the existence of such relatively light massive modes, namely the\nHiggsino triplets, and depending on the model there could be additional modes. The\nGUT breaking mechanism of [38] in principle also allow one to eliminate dimension five\noperators leading to proton decay. However with such a low mass for the triplets, even\ndimension six proton decay could lead to trouble. Therefore it was suggested in [39] that\nfor the GUT breaking mechanism in [38] to be viable, one should also modify the running\n28\n\n\fso as to get \u03b1GU T \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.3. This could be engineered by having additional 5 5 pairs\nbelow the GUT scale. We will briefly suggest a different GUT-breaking mechanism in\nsection 3.7.\n3.4. Comments on anomaly cancellation\nIn type IIa string theory, non-abelian anomalies due to chiral fermions at brane intersections can be cancelled by anomaly inflow. To see this, we have an interaction\nSCS =\n\nZ\n\nC\n\n(1)\n\n3\n\n\u2227 Tr(F ) = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nF (2) \u2227 \u03c95 (A)\n\n(3.46)\n\nZ\n\ndF (2) \u2227 I41 (A, \u039b)\n\n(3.47)\n\nUnder a gauge transformation \u039b we have\n\u03b4\u039b SCS = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nF\n\n(2)\n\n\u2227 \u03b4\u039b \u03c95 (A) =\n\nFurther, 6-branes are monopole configurations for C (1) :\ndF (2) /2\u03c0 \u223c\n\nX\n\nNa \u03b4 3 (Pa )\n\n(3.48)\n\na\n\nTherefore the term \u03b4\u039b SCS above is of precisely the right form to cancel non-abelian anomalies due to chiral fermions at brane intersections.\nIn M-theory, the RR gauge field C (1) is generally massive, and so is not included as\na propagating degree of freedom in the effective action. However after integrating it out,\nthere must be a residual interaction which is not invariant under gauge transformations,\nfor otherwise the anomalies above could not be cancelled. Reference [40] explained what\nthis residual interaction looks like in a local model. The geometry near a 6-brane locally\nlooks like an An ALE fibration over S 3 . The ALE has a natural U(1) isometry that\ncommutes with the holonomy, and as we fiber over S 3 we may get a non-trivial U(1)\nbundle. The curvature of the corresponding U(1) bundle over S 3 is denoted by K; it\nbecomes F (2) in a IIa limit. Then in [40] it is essentially argued that the coupling (3.46)\nsurvives in M-theory in the following form:\nZ\n\nd7 x\n\nK\n\u2227 \u03c95 (A),\n2\u03c0\n\ndK =\n\nX\n\nna \u03b4Pa\n\n(3.49)\n\nwhere Pa are the locations of chiral and anti-chiral matter, and na their multiplicities.\nAs written, this interaction only makes sense for local geometries which are fibered by\nAn ALE spaces and not for more general G2 -manifolds, but presumably there is a more\n29\n\n\fgeneral expression that reduces to the above one in a scaling limit. This is an additional\ncoupling in the action beyond the terms we have considered so far, which is needed for\nconsistency. The associated tadpole constraint expresses cancellation of the non-abelian\nanomalies.\nOne may also consider abelian anomalies. Let us briefly review some arguments in\n[40] (see also [41]). Chiral fields are localized at codimension 7 singularities, and locally\nthe G2 metric may be written as\nds2 \u223c dr 2 + r 2 ds2Y\u03b1\n\n(3.50)\n\nwhere r is a radial coordinate. We cut such a local neighbourhood around each codimension 7 singularity. Then our G2 manifold X7 becomes a manifold-with-boundary X7\u2032 , with\n\u2202X7\u2032 = \u222a\u03b1 Y\u03b1 . We expand C3 in harmonic forms on X7\u2032 :\nC3 \u223c Ai \u2227 \u03c9 i + aj \u2227 \u03c7j\n\n(3.51)\n\nHere \u03c9 i are harmonic 2-forms and \u03c7j are harmonic 3-forms, so the Ai are our fourdimensional abelian gauge fields and the aj are four-dimensional axions. Then under a\ngauge transformation C3 \u2192 C3 + d\u039b, the Chern-Simons term varies as\n\u03b4\u039b SCS \u223c \u2212\n\nZ\n\nR4 \u00d7\u2202X\n\nXZ\n\n\u039b\u2227G\u2227G \u223c \u2212\n\nR4\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u01ebi Fj \u2227 Fk\n\nZ\n\nY\u03b1\n\n\u03c9i \u2227 \u03c9j \u2227 \u03c9k\n\n(3.52)\n\nwhere we decomposed \u039b as \u039b \u223c \u01ebi \u03c9 i . This is cancelled if there are fermion zero modes\n\u03c8\u03c3 localized at the singularity, with U(1) anomalies given by\nX\n\nq\u03c3i q\u03c3j q\u03c3k\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n\nZ\n\nY\u03b1\n\n\u03c9i \u2227 \u03c9j \u2227 \u03c9k\n\n(3.53)\n\nMoreover from Stokes's theorem we get\n0 =\n\nX\n\nq\u03c3i q\u03c3j q\u03c3k\n\n(3.54)\n\n\u03c3,\u03b1\n\nwhich one interprets as cancellation of the cubic U(1) anomalies. Similarly one may\ndiscuss mixed abelian-gravitational anomalies and mixed abelian/non-abelian anomalies.\nAt first sight there is one puzzling aspect about this derivation. It implies that in\nM-theory compactifications on G2 manifolds, the chiral spectrum is such that the light\nU(1)'s are always non-anomalous, and no Green-Schwarz mechanism is ever needed. On\nthe other hand, type IIa with D6 branes lifts to M-theory on G2 , and there can also be\n30\n\n\fheterotic duals. In both of these contexts, there can be light anomalous U(1)'s and there\nis a Green-Schwarz mechanism for their cancellation.\nThe likely resolution to this puzzle is as follows. In these other settings, the anomalous\nU(1)'s obtain a mass of order \u223c gY M,4 l\u22121\ns through the Green-Schwarz terms, and this mass\nis always parametrically lighter than the KK scale. Thus it makes sense to have anomalous\nU(1)'s below the KK scale and a Green-Schwarz mechanism for cancelling their anomalies.\nThis is true even in F -theory. However the lift from IIa to M-theory is a little more subtle,\nand it seems a priori possible that such anomalous U(1)'s in type IIa will lift to massive\nU(1)'s in M-theory with masses scaling like 1/RKK . In that case we should treat these\nmassive U(1)'s on the same footing as other massive U(1) gauge bosons, and there will\nbe no anomalous U(1)'s in the effective action below the KK scale, in agreement with the\narguments of [40].\n3.5. Techniques from algebraic topology\nIn this section we would like to apply some simple techniques from algebraic topology\nin order to compute the relative betti numbers hi (M, \u2202 + M) in terms of the topological\nproperties of the positive and negative boundaries. We actually work with the homology,\nwhich can easily be dualized to cohomology. We assume that the positive charge density\nis smeared along a graph \u2206+ with n+ components and l+ loops, and similarly the negative\ncharge density is smeared along a graph \u2206\u2212 with n\u2212 components and l\u2212 loops. For some\nexamples see figure 5 in section 3.6. The open manifold M is identified with S 3 \\(\u2206+ \u222a\u2206\u2212 ).\nIn order to compute the relative betti numbers and the Euler character, there are\ntwo relevant long exact sequences. The first is the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Suppose a\nmanifold X is covered by two open sets U, V . Then we have the long exact sequence\n. . . \u2192 Hi (U \u2229 V ) \u2192 Hi (U) \u2295 Hi (V ) \u2192 Hi (X) \u2192 Hi\u22121 (U \u2229 V ) \u2192 . . .\n\n(3.55)\n\nIn particular, the Euler characters are related as\n\u03c7(X) = \u03c7(U) + \u03c7(V ) \u2212 \u03c7(U \u2229 V )\n\n(3.56)\n\nIn the application we have in mind, X = S 3 , U is S 3 with a small tubular neighbourhood\nof the negative boundary excised, and V is itself a tubular neighbourhood of the negative\nboundary. Suppose the graph has n\u2212 components and has l\u2212 loops. Then U \u2229 V is\ntopologically a collection of higher genus Riemann surfaces, so we have bi (U \u2229 V ) =\n{n\u2212 , 2l\u2212 , n\u2212 , 0}. Furthermore we have bi (V ) = bi (\u2206\u2212 ). It follows from the long exact\nsequence that\nb3 (S 3 \\\u2206\u2212 ) = 0,\n\nb2 (S 3 \\\u2206\u2212 ) = n\u2212 \u2212 1,\n\nb1 (S 3 \\\u2206\u2212 ) = l\u2212 ,\n31\n\nb0 (S 3 \\\u2206\u2212 ) = 1.\n\n(3.57)\n\n\fIn particular\n\u03c7(S 3 \\\u2206\u2212 ) = n\u2212 \u2212 l\u2212\n\n(3.58)\n\nThe second sequence we need is the one for relative homology. If A is a subset of X,\nthen we have\n. . . \u2192 Hi (A) \u2192 Hi (X) \u2192 Hi (X, A) \u2192 Hi\u22121 (A) \u2192 . . .\n(3.59)\nIn particular\n\u03c7(X, A) = \u03c7(X) \u2212 \u03c7(A)\n\n(3.60)\n\nFor our application, we would like to take X to be M \u223c S 3 \\(\u2206+ \u222a\u2206\u2212 ), and A to be a small\ntubular neighbourhood of \u2206+ \u223c \u2202 + M. In fact by the excision axiom, because \u2206+ \u2282 A,\nit is equivalent to take X = S 3 \\\u2206\u2212 . The precise betti numbers b1 (X, A) and b2 (X, A)\ndepend on the details of how the graphs are linked. From the long exact sequence, we\nfind that they are given by\nb2 (M, \u2202 + M) = n\u2212 \u2212 1 + l+ \u2212 r\n\nb1 (M, \u2202 + M) = n+ \u2212 1 + l\u2212 \u2212 r\n\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 min(l+ , l\u2212 )\n\n(3.61)\n\nHere r is the rank of the inclusion map\nH1 (\u2202 + M) \u2192 H1 (S 3 \\\u2206\u2212 )\n\n(3.62)\n\nThat is, any loop in \u2206+ is naturally embedded in S 3 \\\u2206\u2212 , and r counts the number of\nloops that remain independent in homology after embedding. Thus we see that r indeed\ndescribes the linking between the positive and negative graphs. If the graphs are unlinked\nthen r = 0. Moreover the Euler character is easily calculated and given by\n\u03c7(M, \u2202 + M) = \u03c7(M) \u2212 \u03c7(\u2202 + M) = n\u2212 \u2212 l\u2212 \u2212 n+ + l+\n\n(3.63)\n\nwhich is independent of r. Thus the net number of generations is easily computed from\nthe topology of the positive and negative boundaries.\n3.6. Example\nIn this section we would like to consider a toy GUT model, obtained by compactifying\na gauge theory with gauge group E7 on the three-manifold Q3 = S 3 . We will use the\nlabelling of the roots shown in figure 4. The group E7 contains a maximal SO(10)\u00d7U(1)a \u00d7\nU(1)b subgroup, and we can take the SO(10) to be generated by {\u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 , \u03b17 }. Under\nthis subgroup, the adjoint representation of E7 decomposes as\n133 = 450,0 + 10,0 + 10,0 + r + r\u0304\nr = 16\u22122,1 + 160,\u22123 + 102,2 + 1\u22122,4\n32\n\n(3.64)\n\n\f\u03b17\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03b11\n\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b13\n\n2\n4\n\u03b14\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\u03b15\n\n\u03b16\n\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b8\n\nFigure 4: The extended E7 Dynkin diagram and Dynkin indices.\n\nIn terms of our canonical basis \u03c9i dual to \u03b1j , the two U(1)'s correspond to\n\u03c9a = 2\u03c91 ,\n\n\u03c9b = 2\u03c91 \u2212 3\u03c96\n\n(3.65)\n\nWe would like to have an unbroken SO(10) gauge group after compactification. In\norder to achieve this breaking pattern, we need to turn on a profile for the Higgs fields\ncorresponding to U(1)a and U(1)b . The Morse functions will be denoted as log h1 = f1\nand log h6 = f6 . That is, the FI parameters are given by\n\u03bb1 = df1 ,\n\n\u03bb6 = df6 ,\n\n\u03bb\u03b8 = \u2212df1 \u2212 2df6\n\n(3.66)\n\nThen the various chiral fields are counted by the following Morse cohomology groups:\n160,\u22123 \u2192 h1 (M, f6 )\n102,2 \u2192 h1 (M, f1 )\n\n16\u22122,1 \u2192 h1 (M, \u2212f1 \u2212 f6 )\n1\u22122,4 \u2192 h1 (M, \u2212f1 \u2212 2f6 )\n\n(3.67)\n\nSimilarly the chiral fields in the conjugate representations are counted by h2 (M, f ).\nNow we will define the electro-static potentials f1 and f6 by specifying suitable positive\nand negative charges on S 3 . An example is shown in figure 5. To compute the spectrum,\nwe use the formulae derived in section 3.5, dualized to cohomology:\nh1 (M, \u2202 + M) = n+ \u2212 1 + l\u2212 \u2212 r\n\nh2 (M, \u2202 + M) = n\u2212 \u2212 1 + l+ \u2212 r\n\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 min(l+ , l\u2212 )\n\n(3.68)\n\nUsing the charge configurations in figure 5, we find\nh1 (M, f6 ) = 2\nh2 (M, f6 ) = 0\n\nh1 (M, \u2212f6 \u2212 f1 ) = 1\nh2 (M, \u2212f6 \u2212 f1 ) = 0\n\nh1 (M, f1 ) = 1\nh2 (M, f1 ) = 2\n\n(3.69)\n\nTherefore we have precisely three chiral generations in the 16, three Higgs fields, and also\none chiral field in the representation 1\u22122,4 . The Yukawa coupling\n160,\u22123 \u00d7 16\u22122,1 \u00d7 102,2\n33\n\n(3.70)\n\n\f(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(C)\n\nFigure 5: Positively charged (red) and negatively charged (black) boundaries\nof Morse functions on S 3 . Case (a) yields an electro-static potential that we\ncall f6 , case (c) yields the potential f1 , and case (b) corresponds to the linear\ncombination \u2212f1 \u2212 f6 . Note that we took one of the pieces of the boundary\ncommon to f1 and f6 , but with the charge density for f6 dominant there.\n\nis in principle allowed by the symmetries.\nThis example is unrealistic in a number of ways. In our non-compact set-up the\nU(1)a \u00d7 U(1)b is not dynamical, but it imposes some strong selection rules. Since the\nU(1)'s are anomalous under the spectrum of the local model, we expect them to become\nmassive upon compactification, but interactions violating the selection rules would then\nstill be supressed by the compactification scale. A nicer way would be to break the extra\nU(1)'s by using non-abelian Higgs fields. Or one could start with an abelian configuration\nand try to turn on an expectation value for the 1\u22122,4 . In the present example such a VEV\nwould still leave an unbroken U(1), so it would be better to start with E8 instead since this\ncan be broken to SO(10) by turning on an SU(4) valued Higgs field. Finally we haven't\nyet incorporated a mechanism for breaking the GUT group to the Standard Model.\n3.7. Breaking the GUT group with an abelian Higgs field\nIn order to break the GUT group, we can in principle proceed in two ways. One\nmethod is to engineer a four-dimensional Higgs field that can do the breaking, like an\nadjoint field. This is not possible if we work with Q3 = S 3 /\u0393 since h1 (S 3 /\u0393) = 0, and\neven if it were one would end up with a conventional four-dimensional GUT model with\nthe associated problems like doublet-triplet splitting.\nThe other method is to give a VEV to a charged field in the higher dimensional gauge\ntheory in the process of compactification. The available charged fields which can get a\nVEV are the 7d gauge field and the 7d Higgs field.\nWe can turn on a VEV for the gauge field in two ways. If \u03c01 (Q3 ) is non-zero we\ncan use discrete Wilson lines with a hypercharge component. This is the conventional\nmechanism used in the heterotic string and introduced in the M-theory context in [38].\n34\n\n\fUnfortunately as we already discussed, this mechanism leads to light Higgsino triplets\nand looks somewhat less than desirable. The other possibility is to turn on a flux with\na hypercharge component. However we have h2 (S 3 /\u0393) = 0 so this is not available for us\n[42].\nThere is then still one other option: we could turn on an abelian hypercharged Higgs\nfield to break SU(5) \u2192 SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1). This corresponds to a reducible spectral\ncover. Apart from the usual Standard Model fields which descend from the 10 and 5\nhowever, there can be additional unwanted matter. Let us denote the pair (C, L) simply\nby L. The spectral cover moduli decompose as\nHF 1(L, L) =\n\nX\nm,n\n\nHF 1 (Lm , Ln )\n\n(3.71)\n\nwhere m, n run over the irreducible components. The off-diagonal components are charged\nunder the extra U(1)'s, which includes hypercharge in this case. We saw an example of\nthis in section 3.6, where we had a scalar 1\u22122,4 . So in this scenario one has to make sure\nthat such hypercharged moduli are massive, i.e. there is no deformation to a smooth\nspectral cover, because there are no light hypercharged scalars in the real world. This can\nlikely be arranged by a suitable boundary condition or by turning on flat spectral line\nbundles on the irreducible components of the cover which can not be obtained as a limit\nof a smooth line bundle after deformation. The crucial part is to check that this can be\ndone while still satisfying the D-terms.\nAnother possible issue is that in the local set-ups we have been discussing, the U(1)\nwould not be dynamical. It can become dynamical when embedded in a compact model\nbut it may have some UV sensitivity. Nevertheless this would lead to very different\nsignatures than breaking by discrete Wilson lines, and so may be worth pursuing.\n3.8. Superpotential terms\nIn this section we would like to explain how superpotential couplings are recovered\nfrom Morse theory. In the 1/t expansion we can think of such couplings as generated by\nmembrane instantons or disk instantons, which map to trees of gradient flow trajectories\non S 3 . The prescriptions were originally found by [37, 43]. We focus on the Yukawa\ncouplings and quartic couplings. This is all that is needed for practical purposes. The\nYukawa couplings correspond to the cup product on cohomology, and the quartic couplings to the Massey product, and so once more we see that the F -term data reflects the\nunderlying topology and may be computed using alternative, combinatorial methods.\nTo define a three-point function we need three functions fi , i = 1, 2, 3 such that the\ndifferences fij = fi \u2212 fj are Morse functions. In practice one of the fi will correspond to\nthe zero section and so is taken constant. Our chiral fields correspond to certain linear\ncombinations of index one critical points of the fij . We assume that a chiral field can be\n35\n\n\fassociated to a definite critical point. One can extend the definition of the three-point\nfunction using linearity.\nThe three-point function is given by the classical overlap of the wave functions of the\nchiral zero modes. In the 1/t approximation, it receives contributions from minimal area\nmembrane instantons, which map to graphs of gradient flow trajectories in S 3 along the\nlines we discussed in section 3.3. Namely we consider embedding graph as in figure 6 into\nS 3 , such that the edges get mapped to gradient flows of fij as indicated, and the ends get\nmapped to an index one critical point of fij . The moduli space of such graphs is denoted\nby M(p12 , p23 , p31 ). When non-empty, it is a manifold of dimension\ndim M(p12 , p23 , p31 ) = m(p12 ) + m(p23 ) + m(p31 ) \u2212 3\n\n(3.72)\n\nIn particular when m(p12 ) = m(p23 ) = m(p31 ) = 1, it is a finite set of points counted with\nsigns. The action of such an instanton is given by\nexp \u2212|f12 (p12 ) + f23 (p23 ) + f31 (p31 )|\n\n(3.73)\n\nand so the Yukawa coupling is given by\n\u03bb123 =\n\nX\n\nn(p12 , p23 , p31 ) e\u2212|f12 (p12 )+f23 (p23 )+f31 (p31 )|\n\n(3.74)\n\ngraphs\n\nAlthough the exponential factors may be scaled out by field redefinitions and are therefore ignored in the mathematics literature, they are physically relevant because the field\nredefinitions would change the normalization of the kinetic terms.\nSimilarly we may recover the four-point function. In this case use four functions\nfi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and we look for graphs of gradient trajectories as in figure 7. The virtual\ndimension of the moduli space of graphs of type (a) and (b) is given by\ndim M(p12 , p23 , p34 , p41 ) = m(p12 ) + m(p23 ) + m(p34 ) + m(p41 ) \u2212 4\nf23\n\n\u2206\nf12\n\nf31\n\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\nFigure 6: Graph of gradient flow trajectories relevant for Yukawa couplings.\n\n36\n\n(3.75)\n\n\ff12\n\n\u2206\n\nf41\n\nf42\n\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\nf34\n\nf41\n\nf23\n\nf13\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\u2206\n\nf41\n\nf23\n\u2206\n\nf12\n\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\nf23\n\n\u2206\n\nf12\n\nf34\n\nf34\n\n\u2206\n\nFigure 7: Graphs of gradient flow trajectories generating quartic couplings.\n\nThese two moduli spaces are glued along the moduli space of graphs of type (c), whose\ndimension is one lower. Again we are interested in the case when all m(i) = 1, in which\ncase we can count a discrete number of graphs of type (a) and (b). The quartic coupling\nis defined as\nX\nP\n\u03bb1234 =\n#M(p12 , p23 , p34 , p41 ) e\u2212| i fi,i+1 (pi,i+1 )|\n(3.76)\ngraphs\n\nThere exist alternative ways to compute the four-point function. Once the boundary\noperator and the three-point functions have been obtained, one may also construct higher\npoint functions through a recursion relation [36, 44]. This may be thought of as a Feynman\ndiagram expansion of our Chern-Simons theory (2.25), however it is more general in that\nit does not necessarily require that we use the Morse-Smale complex. In case of the fourpoint function this computes the (lenght 3) Massey product. If the boundary operator and\nthe three-point function have been normalized correctly, these two constructions should\nbe equivalent up to field redefinition of the form \u03a6i \u2192 \u03a6i + cijk \u03a6j \u03a6k +higher order. There\nare generalizations to higher point functions along the same lines.\n3.9. Unsuppressed couplings and degenerate critical points\nSo far we have assumed that chiral fields are localized at non-degenerate critical points.\nIn this case the interactions between chiral fields are described as being generated by\ninstanton effects. Interactions are therefore generically small, and this will lead to phenomenological problems. In particular, this would lead to the prediction that the top\nquark Yukawa coupling is rather small, whereas in fact it turns out to be of order one.\nIn order to get unsuppressed couplings, we must tune the boundary conditions on\nthe flavour branes so that the endpoints of the trivalent graph for the Yukawa coupling\nlive close together. In this limit, the instanton approximation is not good, but we can\nget another weakly coupled description by analyzing the Dirac equation and couplings\ndirectly for a degenerate (non-Morse) critical point. Although we have not carried out\nthe analysis, one expects to be able to get a non-zero classical contribution to the Yukawa\ncouplings this way, at least for the down type or off-diagonal up-type Yukawa couplings.\n37\n\n\fThis however may still not be enough for the top quark, as was pointed out in [45].\nIn our present language, if the QL and UR come from the same critical point, then the\ntrivalent graph for the Yukawa coupling must have two legs on that critical point. This\nseems impossible to achieve if the graph must live in a small local neighbourhood of the\ncritical point, because the two 10's in the 10 * 10 * 5 coupling have different weights under\nthe holonomy group of the Higgs bundle (i.e. they live on different sheets of the spectral\ncover), and so one of the legs of the graph will have to pass through a branch point or\nwrap around a boundary. Thus no matter how close the 10 and 5h , the diagonal uptype Yukawa couplings would still seem to be subject to some exponential suppression.\nOvercoming this issue is one of the key points that needs to be addressed in M-theory\nphenomenology.\nIt's also interesting to point out that one needs exceptional gauge groups in 7d to\ndescribe the top quark Yukawa coupling in M-theory, just as in F -theory or the heterotic\nstring, and essentially for the same reason [45]. In the language of the present paper,\nthis is because the fermion zero modes live in non-trivial representations of the holonomy\ngroup of the Higgs bundle, which is itself a subgroup of the (complexified) gauge group\nin 7d. Interaction terms must be invariant however, so it must be possible to make the\nYukawa coupling a singlet under this holonomy group. In the case of the top quark\nYukawa coupling in an SU(5) GUT model, this singles out the exceptional groups for\npurely group theoretical reasons.\nIn F -theory one may take a scaling limit to map models to a IIb description [24].\nThe top quark Yukawa is then described as a D1 instanton effect. An analogous limit\nis not yet known for G2 manifolds, but we know that membrane instantons get mapped\nto worldsheet disk instantons and D2-instantons. As usual, the top quark Yukawa is\ncharged under the U(1) \u2282 U(5) in the IIa description. This U(1) is anomalous but it is\nparametrically lighter than the KK scale in the IIa limit. The instanton action will then\nhave to shift under the U(1) gauge transformation in order to compensate for the lack of\ninvariance of the up type Yukawa coupling, or it should be neutral for the case of the down\ntype coupling. Since the Ramond three-form shifts under such a gauge transformation\nand the NS two-form doesn't, we expect that membrane instantons get mapped to D2\ninstantons if they generate an up type Yukawa, and to disk instantons if they generate a\ndown type Yukawa.\n3.10. Novikov cohomology\nNow we discuss the more general possibilities for the boundary behaviour of abelian\nHiggs fields:\nA \u223c \u03b1d\u03b8\n\u03c6 \u223c \u03b2d log r + \u03b3d\u03b8\n\n(3.77)\n\nFirst we consider \u03b2, \u03b3 6= 0 but still \u03b1 = 0. In this case we can no longer define an electrostatic potential, since it would have to be multi-valued. Related to this, there may be\n38\n\n\fan infinite number of gradient flow trajectories connecting two critical points, and hence\nthe boundary operator is no longer well-defined. However we can still define a potential\non a multiple cover of M, define critical points and flow lines, and define a equivariant\nboundary operator and a cohomology theory. This more general cohomology is called\nNovikov cohomology. We will next explain how this arises from the supersymmetric\nquantum mechanics discussed previously, which can actually be defined by replacing df\nby an arbitrary closed one-form \u03c6.\nThe Novikov homology depends on the cohomology class [\u03c6] of the closed one-form,\nwhich specifies the monodromies. The D-terms imply that \u03c6 is harmonic. By Hodge\ntheory arguments, there should be a unique harmonic form in the class whose periods\nare specified by [\u03c6]. Given a cohomology class, we may construct the minimal cover M\u0303\u03c6\non which \u03c6 becomes exact, \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c6 = df . Generically this is the universal cover. Denote by\n\u0393 the group of covering transformations. Then f satisfies f (gx) = f (x) + \u03be(g), g \u2208 \u0393,\nwhere \u03be(g) are the 'periods' of [\u03c6]. Note that \u03be(g) is independent of x.\nSince locally the situation is exactly the same as when the periods of \u03c6 vanish, we still\nget a chiral fermion for each critical point of \u03c6 in the 1/t expansion. Thus the generators\nof the Novikov cohomology are still given by the critical points. However the coefficients\nwill no longer be real-valued but rather valued in a power series in order to keep track of\nadditional information. As before the action of dt defines a boundary operator\ndt |ai =\n\nX\n\nb\u2208Cri+1 (M ),g\u2208\u0393\n\nn(a, gb)e\u2212t(f (gb)\u2212f (a)) |bi\n\n(3.78)\n\nNote that n(a, gb) is only non-zero when f (gb) > f (a). By rescaling |ai , |bi we can write\nthis as\nX\ndt |ai =\nn(a, gb)q \u03be(g) |bi\n(3.79)\n|bi\u2208Cri+1 (M ),g\u2208\u0393\n\nwhere q = e\u2212t and q \u03be(g) corresponds to the part of the instanton action that cannot be\nscaled out.\nWe see that the 'numbers' multiplying |bi are no longer integers, but live in a ring of\npower series called the Novikov ring Nov(\u0393). It is defined as the ring of formal power\nseries\n(\u221e\n)\nX\nNov(\u0393) =\nni q \u03b3i | \u03b3i \u2208 R, \u03b3i < \u03b3i+1 , \u03b3i \u2192 \u2212\u221e\n(3.80)\ni=0\n\ni.e. \u03b3i takes values in a discrete set which tends to minus infinity, and the ni are integers.\nThe cohomology of dt is called the Novikov cohomology:\nHN\u2217 ov (M, [\u03c6])\n\n(3.81)\n\nSince the chain complex is a module over Nov(\u0393), hence so is the cohomology. It is known\nthat HN\u2217 (M, [\u03c6]) decomposes as a finite sum of free and torsion modules over Nov(\u0393).\n39\n\n\fThe zero modes we are after are annihilated by both dt and d\u2020t . This number may\njump for a finite number of values of t, but excluding those values it is independent of t.\nHence the generic number of zero modes corresponds to the number of generators of the\ncohomology of dt over the Novikov ring, i.e. by the Novikov-Betti numbers:\nhi (M, [\u03c6]) = rankN ov(\u0393) HNi (M, [\u03c6])\n\n(3.82)\n\nIf [\u03c6] = 0, i.e. if \u03c6 = df for some f , this reduces to the usual Betti numbers. Since\nour Dirac equation is defined over the real numbers, we can ignore the torsion. Thus\nhi (M, [\u03c6]) counts the massless chiral matter.\nIt is natural to expect that the effect of turning on additional monodromy is to reduce\nthe total amount of massless matter, i.e. we expect\nhi (M, [\u03c6]) \u2264 hi (M, [\u03c6] = 0)\n\n(3.83)\n\nIn the case without boundary, a proof can be found in [46]. Furthermore, if the periods\ncan be turned off continuously (as would certainly be the case if we work on a simply\nconnected manifold like S 3 ), then the net amount of chiral matter can clearly not change.\nThus\nh2 (M, [\u03c6]) \u2212 h1 (M, [\u03c6]) = \u03c7(M, \u2202 + M)\n(3.84)\nAs we vary [\u03c6] in H 1 (M, R), the Betti numbers hi (M, [\u03c6]) are generically constant, but\nmay jump up on algebraic subsets of H 1 (M, R). However they must always satisfy the\nidentities above.\nFinally we would like to also allow for \u03b1 6= 0, i.e. we turn on a flat spectral line bundle.\nIn this case we also need to take into account the holonomy of the gauge field, and the\naction of dt is modified to\ndt |ai =\n\nX\n\nn(a, gb) ei\n\nR gb\na\n\nA \u2212 21 t(f (gb)\u2212f (a))\n\ne\n\nb\u2208Cri+1 (M ),g\u2208\u0393\n\n|bi\n\n(3.85)\n\nAgain after scaling out a common piece, we can write this as\ndt |ai =\n\nX\n\nb\u2208Cri+1 (M ),g\u2208\u0393\n\nn(a, gb) ei\u03c1(g) q \u03be(g) |bi\n\n(3.86)\n\nR gb\nHere \u03c1(g) = b A is the representation describing the holonomies of the flat line bundle.\nThis yields a twisted version of Novikov cohomology. Not much seems to be known about\nit. However when \u03b3 \u2192 0 it reduces to the cohomology with values in L, i.e. H i (M, L)\n[46]. Since we would expect that turning on \u03b3 generally only decreases the betti numbers,\n40\n\n\fthis can be used to get even stronger constraints on the spectrum. If we can continuously\nset \u03b1 to zero, then the net number of chirals is not affected.\nSo all in all, in the abelian case we have a fair amount of control. The Betti numbers are computable when \u03b3 = 0 and should only decrease when we turn on Higgs field\nmonodromies starting from a configuration with \u03b3 = 0. Further under such continuous\ndeformations, the net number of chirals is unchanged. In all cases, thinking in the spectral cover picture, we can 'close the loop' of the boundary of a disk instanton by adding\na segment along the zero section, recovering the definition of Floer cohomology on the\ncotangent bundle.\n3.11. Knot invariants\nGiven a knot, link or graph \u2206 in S 3 with specified Gl(n, C) monodromies around\nit, there should be Lagrangian three-cycle in T \u2217 S 3 with boundary specified by \u2206. As\ndiscussed in this paper, such a configuration defines an effective 4d gauge theory, in fact it\ndefines a whole ensemble of gauge theories since we can embed the holonomy in different\ngauge groups. Similar configurations have been considered before but focus on the Wilson\nline correlation functions of the CS theory as knot invariants. Here we see that there is\nanother natural set of observables which can be used as invariants, namely the 4d massless\nspectrum of the compactified gauge theory and its superpotential (as a function of the\nmassless chiral fields). Presumably this encodes equivalent data, but it may provide a\nuseful reformulation.\nAcknowledgements: We are indebted to B. Acharya, C. Beasley, R. Donagi and N.

See [47] for a classic account and [48, 30]\nfor a more modern perspective.\nConsider a compact manifold M and a function f : M \u2192 R. The function f is said to\nbe Morse if all its critical points are non-degenerate, i.e. the Hessian at the critical point\nhas no zero eigenvalues. We pick an auxiliary metric g and define the gradient flow\n\u2202~x\n= \u2212\u2207f\n\u2202\u03bb\n\n(A.1)\n\nWe denote by \u03c6\u03bb (x) the solution of this equation (the gradient flow trajectory) which\nstarts at x at time \u03bb = 0. Since any critical point is non-degenerate, up to coordinate\ntransformations the only invariant data of the Hessian is the number of positive and the\nnumber of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian. The number of negative eigen-values is\ncalled the Morse index of the critical point.\nMorse functions can be used to deduce the homotopy type of the manifold M. Given\na critical point p, we define the unstable manifold of p to be the set of points on M that\nlie on a gradient flow trajectory starting at p:\nWu (p) = {x \u2208 M|\u03c6(x, \u2212\u221e) = p}\n\n(A.2)\n\nSimilarly one may define the stable manifold Ws (p), which consists for the gradient flow\ntrajectories ending at p. Then Wu (p) has the topology of a cell of dimension i, where i is\nthe Morse index of p, and M is the union of these cells\nM = \u222ap Wu (p)\n\n(A.3)\n\nTo learn about the homotopy type, we have to understand how the cells are glued together.\nWe define the manifolds-with-boundary\nMa = {p \u2208 M|f (p) \u2264 a}\n\n(A.4)\n\nThe manifolds Ma and Mb are diffeomorphic if there are no critical points in f \u22121 [a, b].\nHowever if there is a critical point, then the topology changes. For a critical point c of\nMorse index i, the manifold Mc+\u01eb is homotopy equivalent to Mc\u2212\u01eb \u222a Ws (c). The proof is\na local argument near each critical point, see [47] for details.\nUnfortunately the above decomposition of M does not necessarily define a CW complex, and so the relation with the homology of the manifold remains unclear. The missing\n42\n\n\fcondition was introduced by Smale. The pair (f, g) is said to be Morse-Smale if the stable and unstable manifolds intersect each other transversally. This can be shown to be\nsatisfied for generic (f, g).\nUsing such Morse-Smale pairs (f, g), one may construct a homology called the Morse\nhomology. We define\nX\nCi =\nZp\n(A.5)\nCriti (f )\n\nto be the free abelian group generated by the critical points of Morse index i. The\nboundary operator is defined as follows. Given two critical points p, q, we denote the\nmoduli space of gradient flow trajectores connecting p and q by M(p, q):\nM(p, q) = Wu (p) \u2229 Ws (q)\n\n(A.6)\n\nWhen non-empty, the dimension of M(p, q) is m(p) \u2212 m(q), the difference between the\nMorse indices. There is a natural action of the real line R on this moduli space, given by\nrescaling the parameter \u03bb that parametrizes the gradient flow trajectory. Modding out\nby this rescaling, we define\nn(p, q) = M(p, q)/R\n(A.7)\nwhose dimension is m(p) \u2212 m(q) \u2212 1. If the Morse indices differ by one, then n(p, q) is zero\ndimensional and counts the number of trajectories connecting p and q. The moduli spaces\nM(p, q) and n(p, q) come with natural orientations, and thus n(p, q) counts trajectories\nwith a sign. We can define a boundary operator\n\u2202 : Ci \u2192 Ci\u22121 ,\n\n\u2202p =\n\nX\n\nn(p, q)q\n\n(A.8)\n\nq\u2208Criti\u22121 (f )\n\nThe fact that \u2202 2 = 0 relies on an analysis of broken flow lines, which lie on the boundary\nof the moduli space M(p, r) with m(p) \u2212 m(r) = 2 and inherit their orientation from\nM(p, r).\nThe correspondence with the ordinary homology of the underlying manifold can be\nunderstood by establishing an isomorphism with cellular homology, which is built from the\nfree abelian groups generated by the cells of a cell decomposition. We have already seen\nhow a Morse function gives rise to a cellular decomposition. To each critical point of index\ni we can associate an i-cell, namely the associated unstable manifold, and the original\nmanifold is precisely the union of these cells. For Morse-Smale pairs, the boundary of\nsuch an i-cell is contained in the skeleton built from the k-cells with k < i. The unstable\nmanifold Wu (p) for p \u2208 Ci gets attached to the unstable manifolds \u222aq Wu (q) where q \u2208 Ci\u22121\nruns over the critical points connected to p by gradient flow. The boundary operator of the\ncellular complex maps each cell to its boundary, with an induced orientation. Similarly\nthe boundary operator of the Morse complex induces a boundary map on the cell complex,\n43\n\n\fFigure 8: Gradient flow trajectories connecting critical points of the height\nfunction on a deformed two-sphere.\n\nsince there is a one-one correspondence between critical points and generators of the cell\ncomplex. It will probably not come as a surprise that these two boundary operators are\nequivalent.\nDually we can also define the Morse cohomology. This is more natural than homology\nfor physicists, because it describes properties of functions on the underlying manifold,\nrather than the underlying manifold itself (although these two points of view are of course\nrelated by Poincar\u00e9 duality). We write generators of Ci as bra-vectors, and define the\ndual as\nC i = Hom(Ci , R),\n\n\u03b4 : C i \u2192 C i+1 ,\n\nhr|\u03b4pi = h\u2202r|pi \u2200 hr| \u2208 Ci+1\n\n(A.9)\n\nor more explicitly, up to a similarity transformation,\n\u03b4 |pi =\n\nX\n\nq\u2208Criti+1 (f )\n\nn(q, p) |qi\n\n(A.10)\n\nIntuitively one may think of a generator |pi of C i as a delta-function differential form\nlocalized at the critical point p, with i indices all of which lie along the unstable directions\nat p. We are using the same numbers n(p, q) as before, but the Morse index is increasing\ninstead of decreasing. Thus this is isomorphic to replacing negative gradient flow with\npositive gradient flow, or replacing f \u2192 \u2212f , which is the incarnation of Poincar\u00e9 duality\nin this context.\nAnother way to think about Morse cohomology was introduced by Witten, and is\ncloser to the M-theory/Yang-Mills picture. The conjugation\nd \u2192 etf de\u2212tf\n\n(A.11)\n\nis a similarity transformation and induces an isomorphism between the ordinary De Rham\ncohomology at t = 0 and a deformed cohomology as t \u2192 \u221e. By the arguments reviewed in\n44\n\n\fsection 3.3, the deformed cohomology is identified with the Morse cohomology. However\nsince the two are related by a similarity transformation, the betti numbers don't depend\non t.\nA well-known example is shown in figure 8. Let us apply Morse theory to the height\nfunction of the deformed two-sphere shown in this figure. There are four critical points,\ntwo of them with Morse index two, one with index one and one more with index zero.\nHowever the boundary operator maps the saddle point to the difference between the two\nmaxima. Therefore the Morse cohomology is given by\nH 2 (S 2 , f ) = R,\n\nH 1 (S 2 , f ) = 0,\n\nH 0 (S 2 , f ) = R\n\nwhich is of course the same as the ordinary cohomology of S 2 .\n\n45\n\n(A.12)\n\n\fReferences\n[1] G.
