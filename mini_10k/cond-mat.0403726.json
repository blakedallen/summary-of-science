Among the simplest of\nthese are the fluorite-structure actinide dioxides UO2 and\nNpO2 , which display complex ordered phases at low temperatures involving coupled electric and magnetic multipoles as well as (in the case of UO2 ) a lattice distortion.1,2\nUnusual magnetic effects have also been observed in\nthe lanthanide dioxide PrO2 , which is isostructural with\nUO2 and NpO2 at room temperature and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 13.5 K. Some years\nago, PrO2 was found to have an anomalously small ordered moment in the antiferromagnetic phase.3 More recently we discovered a broad continuum in the magnetic\nexcitation spectrum probed by neutron inelastic scattering, which we ascribed to Jahn-Teller fluctuations involving the orbitally degenerate 4f ground state and\ndynamic distortions of the lattice.4 In a separate neutron diffraction experiment5 we found evidence that the\nantiferromagnetic structure contains a component with\ntwice the periodicity of the accepted magnetic structure,\nand we have recently reported further neutron diffraction\nstudies6 which reveal an internal distortion of the fluorite\nstructure below TD = 120 \u00b1 2 K and a related distortion\nof the antiferromagnetic structure below TN . These distortions result in a doubling of both the crystallographic\nand magnetic unit cells along one crystal axis. The magnetic structure is found to consist of two components: a\nprimary component whose unit cell is the same as that\nof the undistorted crystal structure (referred to hereafter\nas the \"type-I component\"), and a secondary component\nwith a smaller ordered moment, whose unit cell is the\n\nsame as that of the distorted structure (referred to hereafter as the \"doubled component\").\nIn this paper we present neutron diffraction studies\nof the magnetic structure and measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of PrO2 under applied magnetic fields\nof 0\u20137 T. The neutron diffraction experiments were designed to influence the alignment of symmetry-equivalent\nmagnetic domains, in order to determine whether the\ntype-I component of the magnetic structure was of the\nmulti-q type. These experiments produced unexpected\nresults which suggest that the alignment of the magnetic\ndomains is strongly influenced by a field-induced alignment of structural domains in the distorted phase below\nTD .\n\nII.\n\nMAGNETIC STRUCTURE UNDER\nAPPLIED FIELD\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the magnetic structure of PrO2 contains two components, the dominant\none being the type-I antiferromagnetic structure which\nhas a magnetic unit cell of the same dimensions as the\nunit cell of the undistorted fluorite crystallographic structure. The secondary (doubled) component of the magnetic structure is described in detail elsewhere.6 There\nare three possible type-I spin arrangements consistent\nwith existing neutron diffraction data. These are the\ntransverse multi-q structures shown in Fig. 1. Longitudinal structures are ruled out by comparison of their\nmagnetic structure factors with the measured Bragg intensities. Neutron diffraction measurements in zero field\ncannot distinguish between these three structures because they give rise to identical magnetic structure fac-\n\n\f2\n\nsingle-q\n\ndouble-q\n\ntriple-q\n\n600\n\n(011)\n\n500\n\n5\n\nPeak count (monitor = 4 x 10 )\n\ntors when averaged over symmetry-equivalent magnetic\ndomains.

The field was applied\nparallel to [01\u03041] and the temperature was held constant at\nT = 1.55 K during both field sweeps.\n\nExperimental Details\n\nTwo neutron diffraction experiments were performed\nusing the same crystal in different orientations with respect to the magnetic field. The first experiment was\nperformed on the E4 double-axis single crystal diffractometer at the Berlin Neutron Scattering Centre at the\nHahn-Meitner Institute. A flat pyrolytic graphite (002)\nmonochromator was used in combination with a graphite\nfilter. 40\u2032 collimators were placed before and after the\nmonochromator, but there was no collimation between\nthe sample and the detector. A square aperture of 10 mm\n\u00d7 10 mm was placed before the detector. The incident\nneutron wavelength was 2.44 \u00c5.\nThe second experiment was performed on the\nD10 single-crystal diffractometer at the Institut LaueLangevin. This was operated in double-axis mode with a\nposition-sensitive detector. A vertically curved pyrolytic\ngraphite (002) monochromator was used in combination\nwith a graphite filter. No collimators were used, but a\ncircular aperture of diameter 6 mm was placed in the incident beam before the sample, and a square aperture\nof 12 mm \u00d7 12 mm was placed before the detector. The\nincident neutron wavelength was 2.356(4) \u00c5.\nFor both experiments we used a single crystal sample of\nPrO2 which was prepared some time ago by a hydrothermal procedure7 and had a mass of \u2248 1 mg. For the first\nexperiment the crystal was mounted inside a vertical-field\nsuperconducting cryomagnet with a temperature range of\n2\u2013300 K and a magnetic field range of 0\u20135 T. It was glued\nonto a thin aluminium pin such that the [01\u03041] direction\nwas vertical and hence parallel to the applied field. For\nthe second experiment the crystal was mounted inside a\nsimilar cryomagnet with a slightly larger field range of\n0\u20136 T. It remained mounted on the aluminium pin, but\nwas re-aligned using an attachment that held it at 45\u25e6 so\nthat the [001] direction was vertical.\n\nB.\n\nMeasurements with H k [01\u03041]\n\nWe first describe measurements performed on the E4\ndiffractometer. Five magnetic reflections of the type-I\ncomponent of the magnetic structure were accessible in\nthe horizontal scattering plane of the crystal ([01\u03041] vertical). These were (100), (011), (211), (122) and (300). At\nthe start of the experiment the crystal was cooled to a\ntemperature T = 1.55 K with zero applied field, and these\nfive magnetic reflections plus several structural Bragg reflections were measured by crystal rotation (\u03c9-scan).\nAfter this we slowly increased the field from H = 0 T\nto H = 5 T in 0.5 T steps (while remaining at T = 1.55 K)\nand monitored the count at peak centre of the (011) reflection. The intensity decreased continuously with field,\nreducing almost to zero at H = 5 T. As we did not warm\nabove TN during the field sweep the disappearance of the\n(011) reflection suggested a spin reorientation transition\nrather than a change in the populations of the magnetic\ndomains. To check that we could regain the original intensity, we immediately warmed the sample to T = 20 K\nunder H = 5 T, removed the field, cooled the sample\nback to T = 1.55 K in zero field, and re-measured the\nfive type-I magnetic Bragg peaks. Surprisingly, the original intensities were not recovered. \u03c9-scans revealed that\nthe intensities of all five peaks had increased by \u223c 100%\nrelative to the initial zero-field measurement. The intensities of the (200) and (022) structural Bragg peaks were\nchecked and found to be the same as they had been before\napplication of the field. We then repeated the field scan\nfrom H = 0 T to H = 5 T at T = 1.55 K while counting\nat the centre of the (011) peak. The intensity was again\nfound to reduce to zero (see Fig. 2).

Detector counts are normalised to a fixed incident beam monitor count of 4 \u00d7 105 ,\ncorresponding to a counting time of \u223c 4 minutes.\n\nIn an attempt to recover the original intensities of the\nfive peaks the sample was heated to T = 35 K and cooled\nback down to 1.55 K in zero field. However, the original intensities were not recovered. The sample was then\nheated to T = 123 K and cooled back down in zero field.\nThis time the original intensities were recovered.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, PrO2 undergoes a\nstructural distortion at TD = 120 \u00b1 2 K, which is accompanied by an anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility.6\nThe fact that we were able to recover the original intensities of the magnetic Bragg reflections by heating\nto T > TD suggests that the PrO2 ground state is\nmetastable in the distorted phase. From now on we will\nrefer to the Bragg intensities obtained by cooling through\nTD in zero field as the \"original intensities\".\nThe intensities of three of the reflections, (100), (011)\nand (211), were also measured by \u03c9-scan at H = 5 T\n(after cooling through TN in the 5 T field). The (100) and\n(211) reflections were found to have increased by \u223c 100%\nfrom their original intensities at H = 0 T, whereas the\n(011) reflection was found to have decreased almost to\nthe level of the background as reported above (see Fig.\n2). The (100) and (011) peaks are shown in Fig. 4 for\ncomparison with those shown in Fig. 3.\nSince the (100) peak did not disappear at H = 5 T,\nwe decided to check its field dependence. Starting from\nthe original intensity, we found that when the field was\napplied at T = 1.55 K there was little change in intensity\nup to H = 5 T. However, when the crystal was warmed\n\nabove TN and cooled to 1.55 K each time the field was\nincremented we observed a smooth increase in intensity\nwith field. Furthermore, the increase did not become\nirreversible until the applied field was larger than H =\n3.5 T. Once the 100% increase had been achieved, the\nintensity of the (100) reflection was unaffected by the\napplied field, whether the crystal was cooled through TN\nin the field or not. The same was found to be true of the\n(211) and (300) reflections. However, the (122) reflection\nbehaved more like the (011) reflection, decreasing to zero\nintensity at H = 5 T when cooled through TN in the\napplied field.\nThe main findings from the measurements described\nso far with H k [01\u03041] are (i) the disappearance of certain\nmagnetic Bragg reflections on application of a field H \u223c\n5 T, (ii) an irreversible 100% increase in intensity of all\nfive peaks when the field is removed above TN and the\nsample re-cooled to 1.55 K, (iii) recovery of the original\nintensities after heating above the structural distortion\ntemperature TD = 120 K and re-cooling in zero field. We\nalso note that the irreversible increase in intensities can\nbe generated by applying a field H \u223c 5 T at 20 K, then\ncooling through TN either before or after removing the\nfield. The application of fields up to 5 T at T = 1.55 K\ndoes not cause the zero-field intensities to increase.\n\nC.\n\nMeasurements with H k [001]\n\nThe experiment performed on the D10 diffractometer\nwas a repeat of the study performed on E4, but this\ntime with the field applied parallel to the [001] direction.\nSince the field was constrained to be vertical in both experiments the crystal orientation had to be changed for\nthe D10 experiment. This altered the scattering plane\nand hence the range of accessible magnetic reflections.\nThe type-I reflections accessible with our chosen neutron\nwavelength were (010), (110), (120), (030), (130) and\n(230). A number of half-integer reflections corresponding\nto the doubled component of the magnetic\nstructure\nwere\n\u0001\n\u0001\nalso accessible, but only the 21 10 and 23 10 reflections\nhad sufficient intensity to be measurable.\n\n\f4\n\n120\n6\n\n450\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n-50\n\nCounts (monitor = 1 x 10 )\n\n6\n\nCounts (monitor = 1 x 10 )\n\n(010)\n\nBefore\nAfter\n\nH=0T\nH // [001]\nT = 2.4 K\n\n19.8 20.0 20.2 20.4 20.6 20.8\n\u03c9 (degrees)\n\n100\n80\n\nBefore\nAfter\n\n(110)\nH=0T\nH // [001]\nT = 2.4 K\n\n60\n40\n20\n0\n-20.0\n\n-19.5\n\n-19.0\n\n1200\n1100\n6\n\nPeak counts (monitor = 4 x 10 )\n\nWe measured these eight peaks by \u03c9-scan at T = 2.4 K\nin zero applied field. We then warmed to 18 K, applied\na field of 5.7 T, and re-cooled through TN in the applied field. Before re-measuring the peaks we warmed\nto 18 K and removed the field before cooling back to T =\n2.4 K (this second warming/cooling cycle was performed\nto reproduce the conditions under which the irreversible\nincrease in intensities was first observed in the E4 experiment, i.e. field removed above TN ). The repeat \u03c9scans revealed that the (110) and (130) peaks reduced by\n\u223c 80%, while\n\u0001 the other\n\u0001 type-I peaks increased by \u223c 40%.\nThe 12 10 and 32 10 peaks increased by \u223c 20% and 30%\nrespectively.

The magnetic field was applied parallel to the [001]\ndirection, and the crystal was warmed above TN and cooled\nback to T = 2.4 K each time the field was changed. Note that\nthe monitor count for this data is four times that of the data\ndisplayed in Figure 5.\n\n-18.5\n\n\u03c9 (degrees)\n\nFIG. 5: The intensities of the (010) and (110) magnetic Bragg\nreflections at T = 2.4 K, measured at H = 0 T before (open\ncircles) and after (closed circles) application and removal,\nabove TN , of a 5.7 T magnetic field parallel to the [001] direction. A monitor count of 1 \u00d7 106 corresponds to a counting\ntime of \u223c 2 minutes.\n\nWe then measured the (010), (110) and (230) peaks\nat T = 2.4 K, H \u2265 5 T after cooling through TN in the\nfield. Their intensities remained approximately the same\nas those observed at zero field after application and removal of the 5.7 T field.\nFigure 6 shows a plot of the count at peak centre for\nthe (010) and (110) reflections as a function of applied\nfield before and after the change in intensities. Each time\nthe field was changed the crystal was warmed above TN\nand cooled back to T = 2.4 K. Once the maximum field\nof 5.7 T had been applied, further changes in the applied\nfield had little effect on the peak intensities.\nIn agreement with expectations following the E4 experiment, we found that application and removal of a large\nmagnetic field (5.7 T) above TN , followed by zero-field\ncooling caused an irreversible change in the intensities\nof the magnetic Bragg peaks. We also found that the\noriginal intensities could only be regained by heating the\ncrystal to T > TD and re-cooling through TD in zero field.\nThe intensities of the (020) and (220) structural Bragg\nreflections were checked at T = 2.4 K, H = 0 T before and\nafter application of the 5.7 T field. Again, these did not\nchange. There was no change in the N\u00e9el temperature\neither, this remaining at TN = 13.4 K for both integer\nand half-integer magnetic reflections.\n\nThe most striking result from the measurements described above is that the changes in the peak intensities are different from those observed during the E4 experiment. In the E4 experiment (when H was applied\nalong the [01\u03041] direction) all the peak intensities rose\nby \u223c 100% after application and removal of a 5 T field,\nwhereas in the D10 experiment (when H was applied\nalong the [001] direction) the relative peak intensities\nchanged: some peaks increased by \u223c 40% while others\ndecreased by \u223c 80%.\nD.\n\nData analysis\n\nWe obtained the integrated intensity of each magnetic\nBragg reflection measured in the experiments described\nabove by fitting a Gaussian profile to each peak, calculating its area and correcting for the geometrical Lorentz\nfactor L = sin 2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the Bragg angle. Tables I\nand II list the integrated, corrected intensities and compare them with the square of the expected magnetic\nstructure factor h|FM (Q)|2 i for a type-I antiferromagnetic structure under ambient conditions, i.e. where all\nthe magnetic domains are equally populated.

However, for H k [001] the relative peak intensities only agree with the domain-averaged h|FM (Q)|2 i\nbefore the irreversible change.\nE.\n\nReflection\n\n(2)\n\nj\n\nH k [01\u03041]\n\nH k [001]\n\nSummary\n\nTo summarise the results of the neutron diffraction\nstudies on single crystal PrO2, we have observed an irre-\n\nversible change in the magnetic Bragg intensities following the application and removal of a large magnetic field.\nThe field required to induce this change is between 3.5 T\nand 5 T when H k [01\u03041] and \u2264 5.7 T when H k [001]. To\nrecover the original intensities the crystal must be heated\nto T > TD and re-cooled through TD in zero field. The experimental results suggest that the field must be applied\nabove TN to induce the irreversible change in intensities.\nWhen the field is applied parallel to the [01\u03041] direction,\ncertain peaks increase by \u223c 100% while others disappear.\nAfter removal of the field, all peaks are found to have increased by \u223c 100% relative to their original intensities.\nWhen the field is applied parallel to [001] some of the\ntype-I peaks increase by \u223c 40% while others decrease\nby \u223c 80%. The half-integer peaks increase by 20\u201330%.\nThese changes are preserved when the field is removed.\nThe intensities of the structural Bragg reflections are unaffected by fields applied along either the [01\u03041] direction\nor the [001] direction, and TN remains unchanged.\n\nIII.\n\nINFLUENCE OF MAGNETIC FIELD ON\nDOMAIN POPULATIONS\n\nWe now attempt to interpret the observations summarised above by considering the possible influence of an\napplied magnetic field on the populations of structural\nand magnetic domains.\nOne of the original aims of the neutron diffraction experiments described above was to influence the popula-\n\n\f6\ntions of magnetic domains by cooling through TN in a\nmagnetic field. By applying the field along certain symmetry directions we hoped to break the symmetry of the\ncrystal in such a way that certain domains would be energetically favoured. In the single-q and double-q magnetic structures some domains have zero magnetic structure factors. Therefore, altering the populations of the\ndomains can alter the magnetic Bragg intensities. However, in the triple-q structure all domains have identical magnetic structure factors, so in this case the Bragg\nintensities will be unaltered by changes in the domain\npopulations.\nThe fact that we have observed changes in the intensities of the magnetic Bragg peaks after application of\na magnetic field along two different symmetry directions\nrules out the triple-q structure. We can also rule out the\ndouble-q structure by calculating the single-domain magnetic structure factors for the observed reflections. We\nfind no single domain whose squared magnetic structure\nfactor is more than 50% larger than its value when averaged over all symmetry-equivalent domains. Thus the\ndouble-q structure cannot account for the 100% increase\nin intensities observed when the field is applied along\n[01\u03041]. However, to prove that the structure is single-q\nand that the increase in intensities observed is due to\npreferential population of certain domains we must determine whether the increased intensities are consistent\nwith the magnetic structure factors of the domains we\nexpect to be favoured.\nThe single-q transverse8 structure has six symmetryequivalent domains, as the ordering wavevector can be\nalong [100], [010] or [001], and the spins can point along\neither of the two directions mutually perpendicular to\nthe ordering vector. Tables III and IV show the singledomain |FM (Q)|2 calculated in these six domains for the\nmagnetic Bragg peaks observed in the E4 and D10 experiments respectively. We use D\u03b1\u03b2 to denote a domain with\nordering vector along the \u03b1-direction and spins along the\n\u03b2-direction.\nIf we assume that the exchange interactions between\nthe individual atomic spins are stronger than their interactions with the applied field, then for an antiferromagnetic structure we expect the domains with the lowest\nmagnetic energy to be those whose spins lie perpendicular to the applied field. We therefore expect such domains\nto be favoured over those whose spins have components\nparallel and antiparallel to the field. If we use this assumption to predict which magnetic domains should be\nfavoured in PrO2 , we expect domains Dba and Dca to be\nfavoured equally for H k [01\u03041]. However, the magnetic\nstructure factors in these domains are zero for all the\npeaks measured in the E4 experiment, in contradiction\nto the observed irreversible increase in intensities. Similarly, for H k [001] we would expect domains Dab , Dba ,\nDca and Dcb to be favoured equally. However, if we average the magnetic structure factors for these domains we\nfind that they do not agree with the observed intensity\nchanges.\n\nSingle-domain |FM (Q)|2\nReflection\n\nDab\n\nDac\n\nDba\n\nDbc\n\nDca\n\nDcb\n\nDomain-averaged\n|FM (Q)|2\n\n(100)\n\n3.00 3.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n\n1.00\n\n(011)\n\n1.42 1.42 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n\n0.48\n\n(211)\n\n1.96 1.96 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n\n0.65\n\n(122)\n\n1.14 1.14 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n\n0.38\n\n(300)\n\n2.06 2.06 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n\n0.69\n\nTABLE III: Comparison between single-domain and domainaveraged |FM (Q)|2 for magnetic Bragg reflections observed\nin the E4 experiment (where the magnetic field was applied\nalong [01\u03041]).

D\u03b1\ndenotes a domain with ordering vector along\nthe \u03b1-direction and spins along the \u03b2-direction.\n\nThe above observations suggest that our assumptions\nconcerning the dominant spin interactions are incorrect.\nBy inspection of table III we find better agreement between the structure factors and increased intensities if domains Dab and Dac are favoured for H k [01\u03041]. Rather than\nhaving spins perpendicular to the applied field, these domains have ordering vectors perpendicular to the applied\nfield. If these domains are favoured, the intensities of all\nthe observed peaks should increase by a factor of 3. The\nobserved increase is a factor of \u223c 2, but it is possible\nthat this is due to incomplete depopulation of the disfavoured domains. Similarly, by inspection of table IV\nwe find better agreement between the structure factors\n\n\f7\nand observed intensities if domains Dab , Dac , Dba and Dbc\nare favoured for H k [001]. Again, these domains have\nordering vectors (rather than spins) perpendicular to the\napplied field. If we average their squared magnetic structure factors we find that the (110) and (130) peaks are\nexpected to disappear, while the rest are expected to increase by 50%. The observed decrease of the (110) and\n(130) intensities by \u223c 80% and the increase of the other\npeaks by \u223c 40% are consistent with a small portion of\nthe crystal remaining populated with the disfavoured domains.\n\u0001\nIn \u0001the D10 experiment we also observed the 21 10 and\n3\n2 10 reflections to increase by 20\u201330% after application and removal of a large field parallel to [001]. These\nreflections arise from the doubled component of the magnetic structure.6 If we calculate the\nmag\u0001 single-domain\n\u0001\nnetic structure factors of the 12 10 and 23 10 reflections,\nwe find that they are non-zero only in domains where\nthe unit cell is doubled along the a-direction. Since\nthe field was applied along [001], i.e. the c-direction in\nthe D10 experiment, we suggest that the applied field\nfavours domains of the doubled component of the magnetic structure whose unit cells are doubled along the\na- and b-directions, i.e. directions perpendicular to\n\u0001 H.\n1\nThe squared\nmagnetic\nstructure\nfactors\nof\nthe\n10\nand\n2\n\u0001\n3\n10\nreflections\naveraged\nover\nthese\ndomains\nare\n50%\n2\nlarger than the structure factors averaged over all domains, in rough agreement with the observed increase in\nintensities of the peaks.\nWe have shown that magnetic domain alignment can\naccount for the observed changes in magnetic Bragg intensities following application and removal of a large\nmagnetic field. However, we have not yet discussed why\nthe changes are irreversible below TD . We propose that\nthis is because certain domains of the distorted crystal\nstructure are energetically preferred in an applied field.\nIn other words, the application of a magnetic field at constant temperature below TD causes a change in the structural domain population. Intuitively, it feels somewhat\nimplausible that a 5 T magnetic field could cause a significant repopulation of structural domains at low temperatures. However, we must remember that the structural\ndistortion is purely internal, so does not produce any\nmacroscopic strain. All that is required is that the oxygen atoms move the small distance between equivalent\nshifted sites within the unit cell. Since it is likely that\nthe cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion at TD is accompanied by ordering of the Pr orbitals, we propose that\nthe mechanism by which the field influences the structural domains is a coupling between the applied field and\nthe Pr orbital magnetic moments. Our analysis indicates\nthat the favoured structural domains are those whose\nunit cells are doubled along directions perpendicular to\nthe applied field. The existence of a doubled component\nof the magnetic structure indicates a strong coupling between the lattice and the magnetic ordering, possibly via\nthe Pr spin-orbit interaction. We therefore propose that\nthe formation of magnetic domains on cooling through\n\nTN is influenced predominantly by the underlying alignment of the structural domains.\nFrom our analysis of the favoured type-I magnetic domains it appears that coupling between the type-I component and the doubled component of the magnetic structure causes the ordering vector of the type-I component\nto lie parallel to the direction along which the unit cell\nis doubled. The strong influence of the structural domain alignment on the magnetic ordering of both the\ntype-I component and the doubled component would account for the irreversibility of the changes in the magnetic\nBragg intensities below TD .\nFinally we recall that in the E4 experiment the (011)\nand (122) reflections disappeared under the influence of\na 5 T magnetic field along [01\u03041]. This occurred both\nwhen the field was applied at constant T = 1.55 K and\nwhen the crystal was cooled through TN in the field. The\nreflections reappeared when the field was removed. To\nexplain these observations we propose that a reversible\nspin-reorientation transition occurs in the type-I component between H = 0 T and H = 5 T for H k [01\u03041]. This\ncauses the spins to rotate parallel and antiparallel to the\nfield as shown in Fig. 7. We arrived at this spin configuration by trying various possibilities until we found\none whose squared single-domain magnetic structure factors were in agreement with the relative intensities of\nthe magnetic peaks observed at H = 5 T (see Table V).\nThe configuration appears counterintuitive because an\nantiferromagnetic structure would normally minimise its\nenergy by rotating its spins perpendicular to the field.\nHowever, our experimental results indicate a strong interaction between the lattice and the magnetism which\ncould alter this simple picture.\n\nH || [011]\n\nFIG. 7: Reorientated spin configuration of the type-I component of the magnetic structure at H = 5 T.\n\nIV.\n\nSUSCEPTIBILITY MEASUREMENTS\n\nWe now present measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of single crystal PrO2 .

The crystals\nwere mounted in plastic sample holders with the [110]\nand [001] directions vertical (hence parallel to the applied field). Their orientations were estimated to be accurate to within 5%. All measurements were made using\nthe reciprocating sample option (RSO) which causes the\nsample holder to oscillate in the vertical direction.\n\nB.\n\nMeasurements and results\n\nHere we present measurements of the magnetic susceptibility performed with the applied field parallel to\nthe [110] and [001] directions. Results obtained for the\ntwo different field directions are compared and discussed.\nIt should be noted that the susceptibility measurements presented in this section are not normalized to the\nmass of the crystals because the crystals were too small\nto be weighed accurately.

The field was increased\nand decreased in steps from H = 0 T to H = 7 T. For each\nmeasurement we applied the field above TN (at 20 K),\nthen measured the susceptibility as a function of temperature while cooling through TN . The data are shown in\nFig. 9, with field increasing in 9(a) and 9(c) and decreasing in 9(b) and 9(d). For both field directions the susceptibility below TN increases smoothly with field through\nthe pale grey region (see 9(a) and 9(c)). Plots 9(c) and\n9(d) are identical, showing that, for H k [110] the increase\nbelow TN is completely reversible and the susceptibility\nabove TN is independent of field. For H k [001], a change\noccurs at H = 1 T. Below this field the susceptibility\nabove TN is independent of field, but above H = 1 T\nthe whole trace increases irreversibly through the dark\ngrey region shown in 9(a).

The field increases in (c) and\ndecreases in (d).\n\nIt should be noted that repetitions of the susceptibility measurements at low applied fields revealed small,\nrandom shifts whenever the applied field was changed\nbetween measurements. This was attributed to fluctuations in the magnetisation of the sample surroundings\nand trapped flux in the superconducting magnet, leading to fluctuations in the applied field of 0.001\u20130.02 T.\nHowever, at higher fields the fluctuations became negligible compared to the total field, so the susceptibility was\nunaffected. Unfortunately it was impossible to measure\nthe magnetisation of the sample surroundings, and it was\ntherefore impossible to measure the exact applied field.\nThis meant that the magnitude of the susceptibility at\napplied fields of H \u2264 0.2 T had an uncertainty of at least\n\u00b1 10%.\nThe plots in Fig. 10 are taken from the same data\nset as those in Fig. 9, but this time the susceptibility is\nplotted as a function of applied field instead of temperature. Figures 10(a) and 10(c) show the field dependence\nof the susceptibility below TN , whereas Figs. 10(b) and\n10(d) show the field dependence above TN . For H k [001]\nthe susceptibility below TN increases rapidly from H =\n0\u20131 T, then increases slowly and irreversibly from H =\n1\u20137 T (Fig. 10(a)). The susceptibility above TN changes\n\nlittle between H = 0 T and H = 1 T, but increases irreversibly between H = 3 T and H = 7 T (Fig. 10(b)). For\nH k [110] the susceptibility below TN increases rapidly\nand reversibly between H = 0 T and H = 7 T, but is\nalmost independent of field above TN .\nIn the measurements described above, the field was\nalways applied above TN . However, we also wished to\ninvestigate the field dependence of the susceptibility below TN without cooling through TN for each change in\nfield. For this measurement the magnetic field was swept\nwhile keeping the temperature constant at 2 K. Figure\n11 shows the results obtained. For H k [110] the trace is\nvery similar to that obtained when the crystal was cooled\nthrough TN in the field. However, for H k [001] there are\ntwo differences. Firstly, the irreversible increase occurs\nat a higher field. Secondly, on removal of the field at T\n= 2 K, the susceptibility does not return to its original\nzero field value. This contrasts with the data shown in\nFig. 10(a), where removal of the field above TN reduced\nthe susceptibility below its original zero field value.\nTo see if an irreversible increase in the susceptibility\noccurred at higher temperatures we measured the field\ndependence at T = 60 K, with H k [001]. An irreversible\nincrease did occur (see Fig. 12(a)), but of smaller magnitude than that observed at T = 20 K. To find the field\nrequired to make the increase irreversible, we warmed\nthe crystal above TD and re-cooled to T = 60 K in zero\nfield. We then swept the field up and down several times,\nreaching successively larger values each time. We found\nthat any increase in susceptibility, no matter how small,\nwas irreversible (see Fig. 12(b)). For H k [110] we found\nthe susceptibility to be completely independent of field\nat T = 60 K.

The anomaly at TD is more pronounced when the\nfield is applied along [110] than when it is applied along\n[001]. For H k [110] the susceptibility increases reversibly\nwith field below TN , but is independent of field above\n\nINTERPRETATION OF SUSCEPTIBILITY\nDATA\n\nWe now attempt to interpret the susceptibility data\nusing our hypothesis that the formation of magnetic domains is strongly influenced by the distribution of structural domains.\nThe most likely cause of the reversible increase in susceptibility with field for H k [110] is the proposed reversible spin reorientation in the type-I component of the\nmagnetic structure.\nFor H k [001] we propose that the rapid quasireversible increase in susceptibility between H = 0 T and\nH = 1 T is due to initial favouring of magnetic domains\nwhose spins are perpendicular to the field (Dab , Dba , Dca\nand Dcb ). This would give rise to a small decrease in\nthe magnetic structure factor of the (100) Bragg peak\nand a small increase in the magnetic structure factor of\nthe (110) Bragg peak, in reasonable agreement with the\nsmall changes in Bragg intensities observed at H = 1 T\n(see Fig. 6). Between H = 1 T and H = 7 T we propose that the magnetic field becomes large enough to\ninfluence the alignment of the structural domains. The\nresulting structural domains cause those type-I magnetic\ndomains whose ordering vectors are perpendicular to H\nto be favoured. This leaves only domains Dab and Dba ,\ncausing the magnetic structure factors, and hence the in-\n\n\f11\ntensities of the Bragg reflections, to change. When the\nfield is decreased below 1 T, we believe that domains Dac\nand Dbc return. Combining the structure factors of these\ndomains with those of Dab and Dba makes no difference to\nthe average structure factors, in agreement with the observed absence of change in Bragg intensities on removal\nof the field. However, the return of these domains with\nspins parallel to the applied field would be expected to\ncause a decrease in susceptibility, as observed.\nThe above discussion shows that the hypotheses outlined in Section III provide some success in explaining the\nsusceptibility data. However, some observations remain\nunexplained. For instance, we observe an irreversible increase in susceptibility between H = 1 T and H = 7 T\nfor H k [001] both below and above TN . We assume that\nthe increase above TN is due to the effect of the applied\nfield on the ordering of the Pr orbitals. However, no irreversible increase is observed either above or below TN\nfor H k [110], and we do not understand why this should\nbe. We also do not understand why a change in domain\npopulations between H = 0 T and H = 1 T should cause\na change in susceptibility for H k [001] when the irreversible change in domain populations after application\nof a large field along [110] causes no irreversible change\nin the susceptibility below TN .\nDespite the above problems, the interpretation of the\nsusceptibility data is in broad agreement with that of\nthe neutron diffraction data. We also note that the susceptibility measurements at low fields indicate that the\n[001] direction is the easy direction of magnetisation, in\nsupport of a single-q type-I component of the magnetic\nstructure.\n\non single crystal PrO2 as a function of applied field and\ntemperature. Both studies were carried out for fields\napplied along two different symmetry directions: [001]\nand [110].\nThe neutron diffraction studies revealed irreversible\nchanges in the magnetic Bragg intensities after application and removal of a large field. We attributed these\nchanges to magnetic domain alignment, caused by a fieldinduced change in the underlying distribution of structural domains. For H k [01\u03041] we also observed certain\nreflections to disappear at high field and reappear when\nthe field was removed. We attributed this observation\nto a spin reorientation of the type-I component of the\nmagnetic structure.\nThe susceptibility studies revealed a reversible increase\nwith applied field below TN along both symmetry directions, as well as an irreversible increase at higher fields\nboth above and below TN for H k [001]. The irreversible\nincrease disappeared at TD , the temperature at which\na cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion of the oxygen sublattice occurs. The changes in susceptibility with applied\nfield are in broad agreement with the proposed alignment\nof structural and magnetic domains, although some features remain poorly understood.\nWe conclude that our neutron diffraction and susceptibility studies have revealed striking hysteresis effects\non the application and removal of a large magnetic field\nbelow TD . We propose that the field interacts strongly\nwith the lattice to influence the alignment of structural\ndomains below TD , and that this in turn influences the\nalignment of the magnetic domains below TN .\nAcknowledgments\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented (i) neutron diffraction studies of the\nantiferromagnetic structure of single crystal PrO2 as a\nfunction of applied field (ii) susceptibility measurements\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nElectronic address: carol.webster@npl.co.uk\nP.
