The spatio-temporal evolution following a quench\nis relatively well known when the broken symmetry phase\nis characterized by a local order parameter that is spatially uniform (e.g. the local magnetization of a ferromagnetic phase) [1, 2]. The growth of spatial correlations, driven by domain growth or the annihilation of\ntopological defects, usually obeys a dynamical scaling relation and the correlation length, or \"domain size\" R,\ngrows as a power law of time with a well defined exponent. Classification schemes have been established for\nthe main different cases [2, 3].\nThe situation is much less understood for phases characterized by a local order parameter that is spatially\nmodulated. Systems forming periodic patterns (stripes,\nhexagons) with a well defined periodicity can be observed in numerous physical systems, such as RayleighB\u00e9nard convection, diblock-copolymer melts, magnetic\nmaterials, or Turing reaction-diffusion systems [4]. After\na quench into a stripe phase, two dimensional configurations are composed of many domains differently oriented, including grain boundaries, dislocations and disclinations. Numerical [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] as well\nas experimental [14, 15, 16, 17] studies have established\nthat it is difficult, if not impossible, to reduce the ordering dynamics of stripes to one of the class known for\nuniform phases. There is still some debate regarding the\ngrowth mechanisms, the value of the growth exponent,\nwhether dynamical scaling holds or not, or whether the\nsystem may involve various characteristic length scales\ngrowing with different exponents. In contrast with uniform phases, the coarsening rates depend significantly on\nthe quench depth. Far away from the bifurcation threshold of stripe formation (large quenches), numerical solu-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: boyer@fisica.unam.mx\n\ntions of the Swift-Hohenberg equation show that coarsening stops at large time, i.e. the system remain frozen in\nmacroscopically disordered configurations [8, 12]. Based\non an analysis of the law of motion of a grain boundary through curved stripes, it was recently proposed that\na single growth exponent could be introduced, but for\nvanishingly small quenches only [11, 12]. From dimensional arguments, a R \u223c t1/3 growth law was derived in\nthat regime, in good agreement with numerical results\nat small quenches [11, 12, 13]. The freezing observed at\nfinite quenches was attributed to the presence of a periodic pinning potential (generated by the pattern itself)\nacting on grain boundaries.\nIn the present paper, we consider a closely related\nproblem where similar questions remain open, and that\nhas not been investigated numerically so far: the coarsening of anisotropic stripe patterns. Oblique rolls making\nonly two possible angles (\u03b8 or \u2212\u03b8, fixed) with respect to\na particular axis can be observed in electroconvection of\nnematic liquid crystals [4]. Studying the ordering dynamics on this system is motivated by various reasons. First,\none can intend a comparison with available experimental\ndata, since coarsening experiments have been recently\nconducted in electroconvection [14, 15]. Second, the\npolycrystalline structures of oblique stripes have a relatively simpler geometry than those of isotropic stripes:\nthe constraint of the fixed angle prevents the formation\nof disclinations. Therefore, the topological defects are essentially dislocations and (chevron) grain boundaries separating domains differently oriented. This situation can\nbe seen as a smectic analogue of the structures formed\nby grains in polycrystalline solids, where disclinations are\nalso absent [18].\nWe consider in the following an extension of the SwiftHohenberg equation for oblique stripes in two spatial dimensions. This model, proposed by Pesch and Kramer\nfor describing electroconvection [19], is recalled in Section\nII. In Section III, we investigate small quenches: the numerical results show that coarsening is driven by surface\ntension and a growth law t1/2 is observed for various characteristic length scales, like in Model A [3]. The results\n\n\f2\nqualitatively change at larger quenches (Section IV): the\ncharacteristic length scales associated with dislocations\nand chevron boundaries start to evolve differently, and\nthe associated effective growth exponents progressively\ndecrease as the quench depth increases. However, the effective exponent of the dislocation density remains fairly\nconstant for a relatively wide range of quench depths.\nThis feature can be explained by the fact that dislocations have a much lower pinning potential than chevron\nboundaries. We qualitatively justify this feature from\nweakly nonlinear analysis arguments. The dislocation\nexponent is close to the value of 1/3 in that intermediate\nrange, in agreement with the value measured in recent\nexperiments [15]. Some conclusions are presented in Section V.\nII.\n\nwith\nF =\n\n2\u03b7\nc\n\u2202\u03c8\n= r\u03c8 \u2212 \u03b6 4 (\u2206 + k02 )2 \u03c8 \u2212 4 \u2202y4 \u03c8 + 4 \u2202x2 \u2202y2 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8 3 , (1)\n\u2202t\nk0\nk0\nwith \u2202x(y) = \u2202/\u2202x(y). In equation (1), \u03c8(~x, t) is a local dimensionless order parameter, interpreted as a small\nlateral elastic displacement; c and \u03b7 are dimensionless\nconstants modeling the loading forces and anisotropic\nbending constants; k0 is the wavenumber of the base periodic pattern, and \u03b6 a \"coherence\" length that will be\nset to 1/k0 for simplicity here. The dimensionless parameter r is chosen as the main control parameter. For\nc = \u03b7 = 0 the above equation reduces to the well known\nSwift-Hohenberg model of Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection (r\nis the reduced Rayleigh number in that case).

If a\nnematics is placed between two glass plates properly\ntreated, its director can be aligned along a preferential\ndirection, say the x-axis. When an external a.c. electric field is applied in the direction normal to the plane,\nperiodic rolls appear above a threshold. As the voltage\nis increased (the frequency being fixed in some proper\nrange), bifurcations to various phases can be observed:\n\"normal\" rolls, with a wave vector directed along the xaxis, usually appear first. This phase can be followed by\na transition to \"oblique\" rolls, of interest here, characterized by a wavevector with two possible orientations with\nrespect to the x-axis, \u03b8 and \u2212\u03b8.\nAlthough the theoretical understanding of electroconvection patterns based on constitutive equations is still\nincomplete, some nonlinear models that rely on equations\nfor a local order parameter and on symmetry arguments\nhave been proposed. Some time ago, Pesch and Kramer\nintroduced an anisotropic model [19] that exhibits a transition from normal to oblique rolls:\n\n1\n2k04\n\nk 2 (c + \u03b7)\n\u2212\u03b7 2\n< 0, { p2c = 0\n,\n2\nc + 2\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7\nc + 2\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 2\nk02 \u03b7\nqc2 =\n} (oblique rolls) (4)\nc + 2\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 2\n\nrc(n) = 0, { p2c = k02 , qc2 = 0 } (normal rolls) (5)\nIn the above relations, we have considered the case c > 0,\nthe condition for which the instability at rc = 0 is to\nnormal rolls (pc = 0). p\nIn the oblique phase, rolls make\nan angle \u03b8 = \u00b1 arctan[ \u03b7/(c + \u03b7)] with the y-axis. As\nobvious from Eq.(4), oblique rolls can only be observed\nfor \u03b7 > 0. Hence, when \u03b7 is tuned from negative to\npositive values, a transition form normal to oblique rolls\ncan occur. In order to study the coarsening of oblique\nrolls, we will chose c > 0 and \u03b7 > 0 in the following.\n(o)\nOblique rolls have the lowest threshold value (rc < 0)\n(o)\nand we re-note rc \u2261 rc for simplicity. As already noted\nby Pesch and Kramer, the structures that are likely to\nbe observed for r in the range [rc , 0] may not be oblique\nrolls, but more complicated, nonlinear structures (\"undulated\" rolls) that are not of interest here. When numerically solving Eq.(1) with random initial conditions\nand rc \u2264 r \u2264 0, we actually observed that oblique rolls\nnever appeared. On the other hand, configurations of\noblique rolls very similar to those observed experimentally [14, 15] are always observed when setting r > 0\ninstead. Normal rolls were never observed in the runs\npresented in the following Sections. This is consistent\nwith the weakly nonlinear analysis of Eq.(1) that predicts that oblique rolls have a lower free-energy F [19].\nTherefore, we define the quench depth as\n\u01eb = r \u2212 rc ,\n\n(6)\n\nwith rc given by Eq.(4). We always chose \u01eb larger than\n|rc | (r > 0).\nIII.\n\nCOARSENING KINETICS NEAR ONSET\n(\u01eb \u226a 1)\n\nWe numerically solve Eq.(1) by using a pseudo-spectral\nmethod and a time integration procedure whose descriptions can be found in Ref.[21].

The configuration is that of a\nsmectic polycrystal: Most of the defects present are grain\nboundaries separating zig and zag rolls, and few isolated\ndislocations can be observed. Due to the asymmetry of\nthe problem, two kind of boundaries can be roughly distinguished: \"horizontal\" chevron boundaries where the\nroll orientation changes rather smoothly from one grain\nto the other, and \"vertical\" (or inclined) boundaries, that\nare made of dense arrays of dislocations. This distinction\nis not very sharp, as one go continuously from one situation to the other, corresponding to boundaries of \"low\"\nand \"high\" dislocation density, respectively. The defect\nfield shown in Figure 2 is obtained from Fig.1 by using\na Fourier filtering procedure. The dark areas correspond\nto defected regions. Dislocations tend to be distributed\nalong string-like structures, like in crystals.\nAt very large times, grain boundaries are weakly\ncurved and isolated dislocations lying inside a grain are\nrelatively rare. These observations agree with recent electroconvection experiments [15], where a mechanism for\nthe formation of isolated dislocations was identified: A\nshrinking bubble can be roughly pictured as delimited\nby two vertical and two horizontal grain boundaries. In\nsome cases, the two vertical boundaries are not composed\nby the same number of dislocations, therefore, some dislocations can not annihilate with others of opposite Burgers\nvector when the bubble shrinks. However, this situation\noccurs rarely.\nWe study the time evolution of the defect density \u03c1d ,\ndefined as the fraction of area occupied by the black regions in Fig. 2.

This could be due to some\nphase correlations of longer range than those associated\nwith domain walls; these features were not investigated.\nThe above results are consistent with a coarsening process driven by grain boundary surface tension and involving a single characteristic length scale, like for the\ndynamics of Model A for a non-conserved order parameter [3]. The law R \u223c t1/2 is also expected to describe the\nkinetics of grain growth in solid polycrystals [22]. This\nsituation differs markedly from isotropic stripes (where\nR \u223c t1/3 [11, 12, 13]). Note that the available experimental studies on anisotropic stripes have reported much\nslower coarsening laws than Eq. (11), namely t1/5 or t1/4\n[14, 15].\nIV.\n\nA.\n\nCOARSENING AT LARGER QUENCH\nDEPTHS\n\nPhenomenology of pinning forces in modulated\nphases\n\nIn solid crystals, for an isolated dislocation to glide\nfrom one raw of atoms to the next one, there is a finite energy cost corresponding to the raws that have to\nbe compressed or dilated during the move. The resulting elastic force, the Peierls stress, tends to prevent the\nglide of dislocations [23, 24]. Therefore, dislocations tend\nto be pinned in positions (periodically spaced) of minimum energy, and motion takes place only if an external\nstress larger than the critical Peierls stress is applied. Remarkably, the defects present in systems that form periodic patterns are also subjected to similar pinning forces.\nTheir origin is nonlinear in that case, and is due to the\napparition of \"non-adiabatic\" terms in weakly nonlinear\nexpansions. Studies on the Swift-Hohenberg model have\nshown that the laws of motion of grain boundaries (or\ndislocation arrays) involve short range, spatially periodic\npinning forces [12, 25, 26, 27]. Either in crystals or in\npatterns, the law of motion of a defect takes the general\nform\n\u03bc\u22121 v = \u03bc\u22121 dx/dt = f \u2212 p cos(kp x),\n\n(12)\n\nwhere v is the defect velocity, x its position (for a grain\nboundary, the coordinate normal to the interface), \u03bc a\nmobility, f an external force per unit length (e.g, the\ndriving force for coarsening), and p the magnitude of the\npinning force, that oscillates with a periodicity 2\u03c0/kp\n\nproportional to the crystal (or base pattern) periodicity\n\u03bbc . Peierls-like pinning forces are usually much smaller\nthan the other characteristic elastic forces (like the critical threshold shear stress fcr ), and have the same general\napproximate expression, valid both for solids [23, 24] and\nnonlinear patterns [12, 25]:\np/fcr \u223c exp[\u2212aW/\u03bbc ],\n\n(13)\n\nwhere W is the width of the defect (see further Fig. 8),\nand a a constant of order unity. For instance, grain\nboundaries\n\u221a separating domains of stripes have a width\nW \u223c \u03bbc / \u01eb [27]. Therefore, close to the onset of the supercritical bifurcation (\u01eb \u2192 0+ ), W becomes very large\nand the pinning potential (13) can be neglected. On the\nother hand, as the quench depth \u01eb increases, W decreases\nand pinning forces can become large enough to affect\nqualitatively defect dynamics.\nDuring a coarsening processes driven by surface tension, the average force f in Eq.(12) is time dependent:\nf \u223c \u03b3\u03ba \u223c \u03b3/R(t), with \u03b3 and \u03ba the typical interface surface tension and curvature, respectively. At short times,\ndomains have small sizes R, and f is large compared\nwith p in Eq. (12). Defects move easily and the average grain size grows. As a result, the driving force f\ndecreases with time. At some point, f may eventually\nbecome lower than the typical value of p (which is time\nindependent). In this case, boundaries become pinned at\none of the discrete stable positions xp such that v = 0\nin Eq.(12). This situation is easy to observe numerically\nfor large quenches (p large), where asymptotic patterns\nremain only partially ordered (\"glassy\"), with many immobile defects [8, 12]. On the other hand, in the regime\n\u01eb \u2192 0, defect pinning is negligible during the numerical time scales studied, and coarsening dynamics is more\nlikely to be self-similar and characterized by well defined\nexponents.\nFor intermediate quenches, well before all grain boundaries of a system become pinned, the Peierls-like barriers\nare believed to slow down the ordering kinetics. At intermediate times, one may still be able to fit in some\ncases\n\u2217\nthe numerical results with power laws, R \u223c t1/z . z \u2217 now\nrepresents an effective growth exponent, and z \u2217 \u2265 z|\u01eb\u21920 .\nB.\n\nPinning of anisotropic stripes\n\nTo check whether the arguments presented above apply to anisotropic patterns as well, we have performed\ncalculations for deeper quenches than in Sec.III.\nFigure 7a shows in gray scale the field \u03c8 of a fraction of the system, obtained for a \"moderate\" quench\nof depth \u01eb = 11|rc | = 0.215, at time t = 500 with\n{c = 12, \u03b7 = 0.5}. The two classes of defects previously\nmentioned, the horizontal chevron grain boundaries and\nthe dislocations, can now be clearly distinguished. (The\ndislocation field is shown in Fig.7b.)

Like for shallow\nquenches, dislocations tend to organize along string-like\nstructures that are generally curved. We interpret the\nimmobility of the chevron boundary as caused by strong\npinning forces. Given two domains of zig and zag rolls,\nthe stable positions of a chevron boundary are imposed\nby the phase of the local order parameter, which does not\nchange across the boundary when one follows a given roll.\nOn the other hand, dislocations are much more mobile,\nsuggesting that their pinning potential p is very low, and\ntherefore strongly anisotropic with respect to the grain\n\n10\n\n100\n\n\u2761 \u2761 \u2761 \u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\n\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\u2761\n\n+ \u22120.32\n+\n++\n+++\n+++++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u22120.42\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u25b3\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u25b3\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u25b3\u25b3\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u25b3\u25b3\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u22120.45\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u2738\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u2738\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u2738\u2738\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u2738\u2738\n\u2738\u2738\u2738\n\u2738\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u00d7\u22120.50\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u2738\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u00d7\n\u2738\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n1000\n10000\n100000\n\nt\nFIG. 9: Relative free energy per unit area as a function of\ntime for c = 12, \u03b7 = 0.5 and various quench depths.

For\n\u01eb \u2265 35|rc |, zF\u2217 then increases more sharply, the signature\nof a sudden increase of pinning effects. A similar behavior (although less pronounced) is observed for zS\u2217 . The\n\u2217\nbehavior of zdis\nwith the quench depth is more abrupt.\n\u2217\nThe variations of zdis\nare quite important for small and\nlarge values of \u01eb. The most striking feature is the presence of a fairly long plateau at intermediate quenches\n\u2217\n(5|rc | < \u01eb < 35|rc |) where zdis\nremains practically con\u2217\nstant, zdis\n\u2243 3. This result agrees with the experimental\nresults of [15], where a law t\u22121/3 was reported for the\ndislocation density.\nC.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe sketch a possible interpretation of part of the above\nobservations, based on the fact that pinning effects are\n\nstrongly anisotropic. We saw that, away from onset,\nchevron boundaries become totally pinned. Meanwhile,\ndislocations are mobile and may still have a very low pinning potential. From the standard relation for the width\nof a grain boundary in stripe patterns, derived from\nweakly nonlinear analysis [27], let us assume that the\nwidth of chevron boundaries (Wc ) and that of a roughly\nvertical dislocation\u221aarray (Wdis , see Fig. 8) are given by\nWc,dis = \u03b4c,dis \u03bb/ \u01eb, with \u03b4c and \u03b4dis two constants of\norder unity. From observations, let us assume that dislocations have a larger width than chevrons: Wdis > Wc ,\ni.e. \u03b4dis > \u03b4c .\nFrom the general relation (13), the pinning potentials\nhave an non-analytical behavior\nat low \u01eb, and saturate\n\u221a\nat large \u01eb (p \u223c exp[\u2212cst/ \u01eb]). If \u03b4dis > \u03b4c , the pinning potentials pc and pdis for chevrons and dislocations\nrespectively, are such that pdis \u226a pc \u226a 1 if \u01eb \u226a 1. A\nmoderate increase of \u01eb can cause a rapid increase of pc up\nto its saturation value, while pdis may still remain very\nlow. This situation can happen in the range of quench\ndepths defined by (a\u03b4c )2 < \u01eb < (a\u03b4dis )2 (a is introduced\nin Eq.(13)), provided that this range is sufficiently broad.\nHence, one would expect the coarsening dynamics to be\nrelatively insensitive to the value of \u01eb in that range, as observed numerically for 5|rc | < \u01eb < 35|rc | in Fig. 11. Further increase of \u01eb eventually produces dislocation pinning,\nand a general slowing down of the system must occur: it\nis illustrated by the inflection of the effective exponents\npast 35|rc |.\nLet us assume next that the system is described by two\ncharacteristic length scales, Ldis and Lc , representing the\nlinear extent of a grain along the y and x directions, respectively. Following the arguments of [15], the dislocation density can be written as \u03c1dis \u223c Ldis /(Ldis Lc ) =\nL\u22121\nc . In the moderate quench regime (5|rc | < \u01eb < 35|rc |),\nLc \u223c t1/3 . In this regime, the results on the energy\nand the structure factor (Fig.11) suggest that the other\n\n\f8\nlength scale, Ldis , grows faster than t1/3 (2 \u2264 z \u2217 \u2264 3).\nTherefore, as time goes, defected regions tend to be\nmore composed of dislocations than chevron boundaries\n(Ldis > Lc ). Unfortunately, this finding disagrees with\nthe experimental results on electroconvection, where the\nopposite behavior was found: a very slow growth law for\nLdis (\u223c t1/5 ), as well as a similar law for a correlation\nlength, was reported in [15]. Hence, the experimental\ngrains are elongated along the x direction at late stages\n[29].\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented evidence that the coarsening of\nsmectic patterns, as given by a potential anisotropic\nSwift-Hohenberg equation, is characterized by a t1/2 law\nclose to onset. This law has not been observed experimentally so far in electroconvection of nematic liquid\ncrystals, and may correspond to a regime difficult to\nreach. For larger quench depths, the phase ordering kinetics is affected by pinning effects that strongly depend\n\n[1] J. Gunton, M. San Miguel, and P.

A particular regime is\nobserved numerically for a fairly wide interval of moderate quenches: chevron boundaries get pinned, and grain\ngrowth still takes place via mobile arrays of dislocations.\nA similar behavior was observed in experiments [14, 15].\nIn this regime, the dislocation density behaves as t\u22121/3 ,\nthe same decay rate as found experimentally [15]. Our\nresults suggest that the characteristic length of a dislocation array grows faster than that of a chevron boundary.\nThis feature disagrees with the experimental findings,\nthough, and may points out a limitation of the present\nmodel. Nonpotential effects, that have been neglected\nhere, probably play an important role in this system.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank M. Dennin and C.
