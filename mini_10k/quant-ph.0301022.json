Tunneling phenomena represent one of the most notable cases where\nsemiclassical techniques can be used to obtain otherwise unattainable information on transition probabilities.\nThere are many cases where the application of semiclassical methods reduces to having to solve the classical equations of motion in the Euclidean time domain, namely\nwith t analytically continued to i\u03c4 . A famous example is\nWKB approximation to tunneling in quantum mechanics with one degree of freedom. In systems with multiple\ndegrees of freedom there are other, more complex situations, however, where the evolution along the imaginary\ntime axis cannot be treated separately from the real time\nevolution which precedes and follows it. This happens,\nfor example, in the study of tunneling in high-energy collisions in field theory [1, 2], where one must consider a\nsystem with definite particle number in the initial state,\nor in the study of chemical reactions where the initial\nsystem is in a definite quantum state [3]. Then, in the\nsearch for complex-time solutions of the classical equations of motion that dominate tunneling, one encounters\na novel phenomenon which, if not properly handled, may\nmake it impossible to obtain the appropriate solutions.\nWe ran into this kind of problems in the study of an interesting class of field theoretical processes, where tunneling\noccurs between different topological sectors and is accompanied by baryon number violation [2, 4, 5, 6]. However,\nthe specifics of the model are immaterial for the features\nof tunneling which we plan to describe in this paper. Indeed, the fact that, with a field theoretical system, one\nis dealing with an infinite number of degrees of freedom\nis also irrelevant for the appearance of the phenomenon\nthat we alluded to above: this phenomenon emerges as\nsoon as one deals with more than one degree of freedom\nand in quite a range of applications of semiclassical techniques. For this reason we decided to illustrate it in this\npaper in the context of a simple quantum mechanical\nsystem with two degrees of freedom. The problems one\nencounters in the study of the field theoretical system and\ntheir solution will be described in a separate paper [7].\nOur hope is that the discussion presented here may help\nto shed some light on how semiclassical methods can be\neffectively applied in situations which a priory may seem\nintractable.\nOur considerations are of quite general validity, but,\nfor purposes of clarity, it is useful to present them in\nthe context of a definite model. We will take this to be\nthe model of Ref. [8, 9], namely a system formed by two\nparticles of identical mass m, moving in one dimension\nand bound by a harmonic oscillator potential of frequency\n\u03c9 (Fig. 1). One of the particles interacts with a repulsive\npotential barrier. This potential barrier is assumed to be\nhigh and wide, while the spacing between the oscillator\nlevels is much smaller than the barrier height V0 . Thus,\n\nV\n\nE\n\n1111\n0000\nm\n\nm\n\n\u03c9\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\nX\n\nFIG. 1: Oscillator hitting a potential barrier, with which only\nthe \"dark\" particle interacts.\n\nthe Hamiltonian of the model is\nH=\n\n2\n2\np21\np2\nm\u03c9 2\n+ 2 +\n(x1 \u2212 x2 )2 + V0 e\u2212x1 /2\u03c3 ,\n2m 2m\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the conditions on the oscillator frequency and potential barrier are\n~\u03c9 \u226a V0 ,\np\n\u03c3 \u226b ~/ mV0 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe problem is to calculate the transition probability\nthrough the barrier for a given incoming bound state;\nsince the variables do not separate, this is certainly a\nnon-trivial problem. Quantum-mechanically the incoming state is fully characterized by its total energy E and\noscillator excitation number N . For E < V0 the transition through the barrier can happen only through tunneling. However, the transition may be classically forbidden,\nand occur through tunneling, also if E > V0 . A detailed\nstudy of the model (Ref. [8, 9]) shows that one can distinguish two regions in the E \u2212 N plane, as illustrated\nin Fig. 2: region A where transition across the barrier is\nclassically forbidden, and region B where it is classically\nallowed. (Since ~\u03c9(N \u2212 12 ) cannot exceed E, the further\nregion with N > E/~\u03c9 \u2212 21 \u2243 E/~\u03c9 is trivially excluded.)\nThe vertex S of B marks the lowest energy at which one\ncan have a classically allowed transition, characterized by\nE = ES = V0 and some definite initial excitation number\nN = NS . Strictly speaking, in order to have a classically\nallowed transition the energy must be (infinitesimally)\nlarger than ES . For E = ES there exists a static, unstable solution to the classical equations of motion, where\nthe system just sits on top of the barrier: x1 = x2 = 0.\nIn the study of field theoretical tunneling processes this\nsolution has been called the sphaleron [10] and, for sake\nof terminology, we will use the term also in this article,\nbut no special meaning should be attributed here to it:\nfor us it will be just a name. The line EPI in Fig. 2 marks\na special class of tunneling solutions to the equations of\nmotion, about which more will be said later.\nIn the region A one would like to calculate the\nexponent F (E, N ) in the transition probability T \u2248\nexp(\u2212F/~). The boundary between regions A and B is\n\n\f3\n\nKinematically forbidden\n\nN\n\nE=h\u03c9N\nA: forbidden\n\nNS\n\nS\n\nB: allowed\n\nEPI(N)\nA: forbidden\n\nE0(N)\n\n0\nES = V0\n\nE\n\nFIG. 2: Allowed and forbidden regions in the model with two\ndegrees of freedom.\n\ngiven by the line E0 (N ), where F (E, N ) = 0. F can be\ncalculated by the method introduced in Ref. [11], which\nwill be recapitulated later. (See also the earlier work\nby Miller [3] for an elegant approach to the calculation\nof the transition probability, based on canonical transformations.) The method of Ref. [11] leads to having\nto solve the classical equations of motion, after analytic\ncontinuation to complex time and complex phase space,\nsubject to suitable boundary conditions. In the tunneling\nsolutions, the system evolves along the real time direction\nfirst, then undergoes the under-barrier evolution along\nthe imaginary time direction. For the solutions situated\non the line EPI in Fig. 2, the coordinates of the particles\nare real throughout the evolution, but this is a very special case. For general tunneling solutions the coordinates\nand the corresponding momenta, have to be continued\nto complex values. This is a defining feature of processes with more than one degree of freedom: in systems\nwhere a single particle moves along a line and tunnels\nunder a potential barrier, all tunneling solutions would\nbe real and behave like the processes on the line EPI . In\nsystems with multiple degrees of freedom tunneling solutions, i.e. evolutions which obey the classical (analytically\ncontinued) equations of motion and obey the appropriate boundary conditions, can be rather readily found for\nE < ES . As the energy approaches the barrier height,\nhowever, something special happens: in the tunneling solutions the system lingers for progressively longer times\non top of the barrier and the boundary conditions become\ntruly asymptotic in time. Rigorously, finite time evolutions that satisfy the boundary conditions cease to exist.\nHere lies the subtlety in the application of semiclassical\nmethods to such processes and the root of the difficulty\nin finding solutions that can be used throughout the domain of classically forbidden transitions (i.e. the whole of\nregion A). As we plan to show in this paper, the difficulty\ncan be overcome by employing a suitable regularization,\nand one can find physically relevant solutions which map\nthe entire region of classically forbidden processes and\nalso merge continuously with classically allowed evolutions as one approaches the boundary E0 (N ). The new\nsolutions we find all describe tunneling onto the top of the\npotential barrier, or onto long-living excitations above\n\nthe top. Notice that the problem is special to transitions\nwhich have an energy larger than the barrier height (i.e.\nlarger than the sphaleron energy) and thus would never\nbe encountered in systems with a single degree of freedom, the systems normally used in textbooks to illustrate\nthe use of semiclassical techniques, where all processes\nwith energy larger than the barrier height are classically\nallowed. Still, even in simple systems with a single degree\nof freedom, one can see a sign of the subtleties that one\ncan, and does encounter in more complex systems. For\nthis reason, and also in order to put our whole formulation on a clear footing, we will start by re-examining\nthe semiclassical description of tunneling in the case of\na single particle moving on a line. This will be done in\nSec. II.\nIn Sec. III we consider the quantum mechanical model\nwith two degrees of freedom. In particular, in Sec. III A\nwe introduce the semiclassical technique for the calculation of the tunneling exponent. Then we examine the\nclassical over-barrier solutions and find the boundary of\nthe classically allowed region E0 (N ) in Sec. III B. In\nSec. III C we present a straightforward application of the\nsemiclassical technique, outlined in Sec. III A, and find\nthat it ceases to produce the relevant classical solutions\nin a part of the tunneling region A, roughly speaking,\nat E > ES . In Sec. IV we introduce our regularization\ntechnique and show that it indeed enables one to find\nthe tunneling classical solutions in the entire region A\n(Sec. IV A). We check our method against the numerical\nsolution of the full Schr\u00f6dinger equation in Sec. IV B. In\nSec. IV C we show how our regularization technique may\nbe used to join smoothly the classically allowed and classically forbidden regions. Our conclusions are presented\nin Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nQUANTUM MECHANICS OF ONE DEGREE\nOF FREEDOM\nA.\n\nClassical boundary value problem\n\nLet us review the derivation of the semiclassical expression for the tunneling exponent in quantum mechanics of\none degree of freedom. The result is well known in this\ncase (WKB formula) and the derivation here may seem\nartificially complicated, but it can be generalized to the\ncase of multiple degrees of freedom, while many of its\ngeneral features can still be captured in the relatively\nsimple case of one degree of freedom.\nLet us calculate the probability of tunneling through\na potential barrier, located in a region near X = 0, from\nthe asymptotic region X \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Let us use a system of\nunits with ~ = 1 and set the mass of a particle equal to 1\n(both can be reintroduced in our formulas on dimensional\ngrounds).

(12c) may be written in the form E = Pi2 /2.\nThe latter equation requires that the energy of the solution is equal to E. One more observation is that\nX\u2032 = X\u2217 ,\n\n(13)\n\nbecause X \u2032 corresponds to the saddle point of the complex conjugate amplitude.

On the other hand, Eq. (12b) states that\nthe solutions X(t) and X \u2032 (t) are different at initial time\nt \u2192 \u2212\u221e, if the saddle point value of T is not zero. There\nis no contradiction: for energy E larger than the barrier\nheight, a real classical trajectory running from X \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nto X \u2192 +\u221e exists; for this solution T = 0 and X coincides with X \u2032 at any moment of time. On the other\nhand, if E is smaller than the barrier height, then there\nis no such classical solution in real time, but the solution\nmay exist on a contour in the complex time plane, which\nwraps around some branch point (as shown in Fig. 3).\nThe solution continued along this contour is in general\ncomplex at large negative times (region A' in Fig. 3).\nThen equations (12b), (12c) and (13) guarantee that the\nsaddle point value of T is real.\nThe boundary conditions may be significantly simplified by shifting the initial time from the real axis. As\nRe t \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the potential is irrelevant, and any\n\u221a solution\ndescribes free motion with momentum Pi = 2E,\n\nFIG. 4: Classical solution describing tunneling.\n\nThen the solution is real also at the part BC of the contour. Indeed, a real solution at the part BC of the contour oscillates in the upside-down potential, T /2 equals\nto half-period of oscillations, and the points B and C are\nthe two different turning points, \u1e8a = 0 (see Fig. 4). The\ncontinuation of this solution, according to the equation of\nmotion, from the point C to the positive real times corresponds to the real-time motion, from the point XC with\nzero initial velocity, towards X \u2192 +\u221e; the coordinate\nX(t) stays real on the part CD of the contour. Likewise,\nthe continuation back in time from the point C leads to\nreal solution in the part AB of the contour. In this way\nthe reality conditions are satisfied at A and D. The only\ncontribution to F comes from the Euclidean part of the\ncontour, and one can check that the expression (14) reduces to\n\nX(t) = Xi + P (t \u2212 ti ) ,\nX \u2032 (t) = [X(t)]\u2217 .\n\nF (E) = 2\n\nLet us choose the initial time in such a way that Im t =\nT /2, i.e. consider the boundary value problem (11), (12)\non the contour ABCD of Fig. 3. Then Eq. (12b) takes a\nsimple form\nX \u2217 (t) \u2212 X(t)\n= 0,\niT\niT\n, t\u2032 = real \u2192 \u2212\u221e ,\nt = t\u2032 +\n2\nwhich simply means that the coordinate is real on the\npart AB of the time contour. Equation (13) implies that\nthe solution is real in the asymptotic region D, i.e. at t =\nreal \u2192 +\u221e. Hence, instead of Eq. (12d) one has reality\nconditions in the asymptotics A and D. After obtaining\nthe solution to the classical boundary value problem, one\ninserts it to the right hand side of Eq. (10) and obtains\nF (E) = 2 Im S \u2212 ET ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere S is the classical action on the contour ABCD.\nIn quantum mechanics of one degree of freedom, the\ncontour ABCD may be chosen in such a way that the\npoints B and C are the turning points of the solution.\n\nZXCp\n2(V (X) \u2212 E) dX ,\n\n(15)\n\nXB\n\nwhich is the standard WKB result.\nTo summarize, in quantum mechanics of one degree\nof freedom, the semiclassical calculation of the tunneling exponent may be performed by solving the classical\nequation of motion on the contour ABCD in complex\ntime plane, with the conditions that the solution be real\nin the asymptotic past (region A), and asymptotic future\n(region D). The relevant solutions tend to X \u2192 \u2212\u221e and\nX \u2192 +\u221e in regions A and D, respectively. The auxiliary\nparameter T is related to the energy of incoming state by\nthe requirement that the energy of the classical solution\nequals to E. The exponent for the transition probability\nis given by Eq. (14), which, in fact, coincides with the\nWKB result (15).\nB.\n\nJoining the allowed and forbidden regions\n\nThe solutions appropriate in the classically forbidden\nand classically allowed regions apparently belong to quite\ndifferent branches. It is clear from Fig. 4 that as the energy approaches the height of the barrier V0 from below,\n\n\f6\nthe amplitude of the oscillations in the upside-down potential decreases, while the period T tends to a finite\nvalue determined by the curvature of the potential at its\nmaximum. On the other hand, the solutions for E > V0\n(classically allowed region) always run along the real time\naxis, so the parameter T is always zero. Hence, the relevant solutions do not merge at E = V0 , and T (E) has a\ndiscontinuity at E = V0 . We find it instructive to develop\na regularization technique that removes this discontinuity and allows for smooth transition through the point\nE = V0 . The reason is that in quantum mechanics of\nmultiple degrees of freedom, similar points exist not only\nat the boundary of the classically allowed region, but also\nwell inside the forbidden region (but still at E > ES , see\nIntroduction and Sec. III B).\nTo illustrate the situation, let us consider an exactly\nsolvable model with\nU (X) =\n\n1\n.\ncosh2 X\n\nThe solution of the classical boundary value problem\nfor energy smaller than the barrier height, E < V0 \u2261 1,\nis\nr\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\nE\n2E(t \u2212 t0 ) .\n(16)\nsinh X = \u2212 cosh\n1\u2212E\nThis solution has branch points at t\u00b1\n\u2217 , where the potential\nbecomes singular (cosh X = 0):\n!\n\u221a\n1\n1+ E\n\u03c0\n\u00b1\nt\u2217 \u2212 t0 = \u221a\n\u00b1 log \u221a\n+ i + i\u03c0n .

The solutions that are\nreal at imaginary (Euclidean) time are obtained for\nRe t0 = 0 .\nLater on, another choice will be convenient, for which the\nreal parts of the position of the left singularities (t\u2212\n\u2217 ) are\nheld at a certain negative value \u2212c. This gives\n\u221a\n1\n1+ E\nRe t0 = \u221a\nlog p\n\u2212c.\n(19)\n2E\n|1 \u2212 E|\n\nWe require X to be real on the CD part of the contour (in\ngeneral, only asymptotically), and in this way determine\nthe value of T /2. In the classically forbidden case, E < 1,\nwe are interested in two branches of solutions. The first\nbranch has T /2 = 0, i.e. the contour ABCD reduces to\nreal axis; the classical solutions on this branch approach\nthe barrier from the left and bounce back to X \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n\nThis branch is not relevant for tunneling. The tunneling\nbranch1 has\nT\n\u03c0\n= \u221a\n,\n2\n2E\n\n(20)\n\nEquations (18), (19) and (20) determine the tunneling\nsolution completely, while the transmission exponent is\nobtained by plugging this solution into Eq. (14).\nIt is straightforward to obtain the classical solutions at\nE > 1,\nr\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\nE\n2E(t \u2212 t0 ) .\n(21)\nsinh X = sinh\nE\u22121\n\nThe role of the two branches is now reversed. The branch\nwith T /2 = 0 describes the over\u2013barrier transitions,\u221ai.e.,\nit is the relevant one. The branch with T /2 = \u03c0/ 2E\nstill exists, but it has X \u2192 \u2212\u221e at both part A and\npart D of the contour, and thus is irrelevant. We note in\npassing that all these solutions are real on the CD part of\nthe contour not only asymptotically, but at finite times\nalso.\nIt is seen that the transition from the tunneling to\nthe over-barrier solutions is indeed not smooth: T has a\ndiscontinuity at the energy equal to barrier height E =\nV0 \u2261 1. The energy E = V0 \u2261 1 is special also in the\nfollowing respect. As the energy tends to V0 from\n\u221a below,\nthe relevant classical solutions (with T /2 = \u03c0/ 2E) stay\nlonger and longer near the top of the barrier. In the\nlimit E \u2192 1 the time the solution spends near X = 0\nis infinitely long. This is reflected also in Eq. (17): the\ndistance between the branch points\nr\n\u221a\n1+ E\n2\n\u2212\n+\nlog p\n(22)\nt\u2217 \u2212 t\u2217 =\nE\n|1 \u2212 E|\n\ntends to infinity as E \u2192 1. The same situation occurs when the energy approaches the height of the barrier from above: the classical over\u2013barrier solutions get\n\"stuck\" near X = 0. In a certain sense, all these solutions tend, as E \u2192 V0 \u2261 1, to the unstable static solution\nX(t) = 0-the sphaleron-describing a particle that sits\non the top of the potential barrier. The latter property\nsuggests a method to deal with this discontinuous behavior of the solutions with respect to energy. The idea is to\nregularize the classical boundary value problem in such\na way that the classical solution X(t) = 0 be unreachable. We implement this idea by formally changing the\npotential\nU (X) \u2192 e\u2212i\u01eb U (X) ,\n\n1\n\n(23)\n\nThere is in \u221a\nfact an infinite set of tunneling solutions with T\u221a\n/2 =\n(2n + 1)\u03c0/ 2E and reflecting solutions with T /2 = 2n\u03c0/ 2E,\nbut the imaginary part of their action is larger than that of the\nsolutions we discuss, so their contribution to tunneling is exponentially small.\n\n\f7\nwhich leads to a corresponding change of the classical\nequations of motion. Here \u01eb is a real regularization parameter, the smallest parameter in the model. At the\nend of the calculations one takes the limit \u01eb \u2192 0.\nWe do not change the boundary conditions in our classical problem, i.e., we still require that X(t) be real in the\nasymptotic future on the real time axis and that X(t\u2032 )\nbe real as t\u2032 \u2192 \u2212\u221e on the part A of the contour ABCD.\nThen the conserved energy is real. The sphaleron solution X(t) = 0 has now complex energy (because the potential is complex). Hence, the solutions to our classical\nboundary value problem necessarily avoid the sphaleron,\nand one may expect that the solutions behave smoothly\nin energy.\nWe will have to say more about our regularization in\nSec. IV: here we show that it indeed does the job of connecting the over\u2013barrier solutions smoothly to the tunneling ones.\nThe general solution to the regularized problem can be\nobtained from (16),\nr\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\nE\n2E(t\n\u2212\nt\n)\n,\nsinh\nX\n=\n\u2212\ncosh\n0\ne\u2212i\u01eb \u2212 E\n\nIm t\niT/2\n\nRe t\n\nIm t\niT/2\nRe t\n\nIm t\n\niT/2\nRe t\n\nFIG. 5: The contour in complex time plane for \u01eb 6= 0, E < 1\n(upper figure), E = 1 (the middle figure) and E > 1 (lower\nfigure).

It is clear from Eq. (24) that T is now a smooth\nfunction of E. Away from E = 1, Eq. (24) can be written\nas follows,\n\uf8f1 \u03c0\n\uf8f4\nforbidden region, 1 \u2212 E \u226b \u01eb\n\uf8f2 \u221a\nT\n2E\n=\n(25)\n\u01eb\n\uf8f4\n2\nallowed region, E \u2212 1 \u226b \u01eb.\n\uf8f3 \u221a\n2E(E \u2212 1)\n\nDeep enough in the forbidden region, when 1\u2212E \u226b \u01eb, the\nargument in equation (24) is nearly zero and we return\nto the original result (20). When E crosses the region\nof size of order \u01eb around E = 1, the argument rapidly\n\u221a\nchanges from O(\u01eb) to \u2212\u03c0, so that T /2 changes from \u03c0/ 2\nto nearly zero. Thus, at E > 1 we arrive to a solution\nwhich is very close to the classical over-barrier transition,\nand the contour is also very close to the real axis. This\nis shown in Figs. 5, 6. We conclude that at small but\n\n\u03b5=0\n0\nES = 1\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\nE\n\nFIG. 6: T as function of E for zero and nonzero \u01eb, thick and\nthin lines, respectively.\n\nfinite \u01eb, the classically allowed and classically forbidden\nregions merge smoothly.\nAt E < 1, the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 is straightforward. For\nE > 1 a somewhat more careful analysis of the limit\n\u01eb \u2192 0 is needed. From Eq. (25) one observes\nthat the\n\u221a\nlimit \u01eb \u2192 0 with constant finite T < \u03c0 2 leads to solutions with E = 1. Classical over-barrier solutions of\nthe original problem with E > ES \u2261 1 are obtained\nin the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 provided that T also tends to zero\nwhile \u03c4 = T /\u01eb is kept finite. Different energies correspond to different values of \u03c4 . And that is what one\nexpects-classical over\u2013barrier transitions are described\nby the solutions on the contour with T \u2261 0.\nLet us now discuss the behavior of the branch points\n\n\f8\nt\u00b1\n\u2217 in complex time plane at small but finite \u01eb and varying\nenergy. A particularly interesting question is whether or\nnot the singularities cross our time contour ABCD. The\npositions of the singularities in the regularized problem\nare (we set Re t0 = 0 here, see discussion after Eq. (18))\n\nt\u00b1\n\u2217\n\nThe behavior of the real parts of the \"right\" (t+\n\u2217 ) and\n\"left\" (t\u2212\n)\nsingularities\nis\nsimple-as\nthe\nenergy\nap\u2217\nproaches the barrier height, the singularities move towards large times, reaching\u221aa maximum distance from the\norigin equal to ln(2/\u01eb)/(2 2) at E = 1, and then move\nback. This again shows that our regularization makes\nthe solutions continuous in energy. The behavior of the\nimaginary parts of the positions of the \"right\" singularities,\u221aIm(t+\n\u2217 ), is also simple: they scale with energy like\n\u03c0/2 2E and stay essentially constant as energy crosses\nthe value E = 1. The imaginary parts of the positions of\nthe \"left\" singularities, on the other hand, rapidly move\ndown near E = 1, together with the contour height T /2\n(Fig. 5). So, the singularities do not cross the contour.\nThus, by introducing small parameter \u01eb, Eq. (23), we\nwere able to regularize the system in such a way that the\ntransition from classically forbidden region to the allowed\none is rapid but smooth, and in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 only the\nphysically relevant branches of solutions are selected.\nAlthough we have already studied all physically interesting solutions in non-regularized problem, let us analyze what happens in the\u221alimit \u01eb \u2192 0 to the regularized\nsolutions with 0 < T < \u03c0 2 and E = 1. At this point it\nis convenient to make the choice (19). Then in the limit\n\u01eb \u2192 0 one obtains a family of solutions with intermediate\nT,\nsinh X = \u2212e\u2212\n\n\u221a\n2(t\u2212i T2 +c)\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nThese solutions are no longer real at any finite time, but\nthey are still real asymptotically, as t \u2192 +\u221e, where they\napproach the sphaleron, X = 0. For all these solutions\nthe suppression exponent (10) is zero.\nThus there are three different branches of solutions\nmerging at each of the\u221abifurcation points E = 1, T /2 = 0\nand E = 1, T /2 = \u03c0/ 2. This is shown in Fig. 7. We will\nsee that a somewhat similar situation occurs in the case\nof multiple degrees of freedom, but there the branch analogous to the branch (26) is not degenerate in energy and\nis precisely the branch of relevant solutions in a certain\nregion of parameters. The generalization of our regularization technique will enable us to select the physically\nrelevant branches of solutions.\n\nA: tunneling\nTS\n\nC: reflection\n\nT\n\n(\n\u0010\n\u221a \u0011\n1\n\u03c0\n= \u221a\nin\u03c0 + i + i arg e\u2212i\u01eb/2 \u00b1 E\n2\n2E\n)\n\u221a\nE + e\u2212i\u01eb/2\n.\n\u00b1 ln \u221a\ne\u2212i\u01eb \u2212 E\n\n6\n\nE: tunneling\nonto\nsphaleron\n\n2\n\nD: reflection\n\nB: over-barrier\n\n0\n\nES = 1\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\nE\n\nFIG. 7: The dependence of the period T on energy E.

This model was already described in the Introduction, see (1) for the Hamiltonian.\nAs in the one dimensional case, we choose units with\n~ = 1, m = 1. The oscillator frequency \u03c9 is of order 1.\nThe system is semiclassical,\u221a\ni.e. conditions (2) are satisfied, if one chooses \u03c3 = 1/ 2\u03bb, V0 = 1/\u03bb, where \u03bb is\na small parameter. Note that \u03bb plays a role similar to\n~, determining the magnitude of quantum fluctuations.\nAt the classical level, this parameter\n\u221a is irrelevant:\n\u221a after\nrescaling the variables2 x1 \u2192 x1 / \u03bb, x2 \u2192 x2 / \u03bb, the\nsmall parameter enters only through the overall multiplicative factor 1/\u03bb in the Hamiltonian. Therefore, the\nsemiclassical technique can be developed as an asymptotic expansion in \u03bb.\nThe properties of the system described by the above\nHamiltonian are made clearer by replacing the variables\nx1 , \u221a\nx2 with the center-of-mass coordinate X \u2261 (x1 +\nx2 )/\u221a2 and the relative oscillator coordinate y \u2261 (x1 \u2212\nx2 )/ 2. In terms of the latter variables, the Hamiltonian\ntakes the form\nH=\n\n2\n\np2y\np2X\n\u03c9 2 2 1 \u2212\u03bb(X+y)2 /2\n+\n+\ny + e\n.\n2\n2\n2\n\u03bb\n\n(27)\n\nTo keep notations simple, we use the same symbols x1 , x2 for\nthe rescaled variables.\n\n\f9\nequations of motion on the internal points of the contour,\nand be real in the asymptotic future (region D):\n\nThe interaction potential\nVint \u2261\n\n1 \u2212\u03bb(X+y)2 /2\ne\n\u03bb\n\nvanishes in the asymptotic regions X \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and describes a potential barrier between these regions. At\nX \u2192 \u00b1\u221e the Hamiltonian (27) corresponds to an oscillator of frequency \u03c9 moving along the center-of-mass\ncoordinate X. The oscillator asymptotic state may be\ncharacterized by its excitation number N and total enp2\nergy E = 2X + \u03c9(N + 1/2). We are interested in the\ntransmissions through the potential barrier of the oscillator with given initial values of E and N .\n\nA.\n\nT /\u03b8 boundary value problem\n\nThe probability of tunneling from a state with fixed\ninitial energy E and oscillator excitation number N from\nthe asymptotic region X \u2192 \u2212\u221e to any state in the other\nasymptotic region X \u2192 +\u221e takes the following form:\nT (E, N ) =\n\nlim\n\ntf \u2212ti \u2192\u221e\n\nX\nf\n\nhf |e\n\n\u2212i\u0124(tf \u2212ti )\n\n|E, N i\n\n2\n\n, (28)\n\nwhere it is implicit that the initial and final states have\nsupport only well outside the range of the potential, with\nX < 0 and X > 0, respectively. Semiclassical methods are applicable when the initial energy and excitation\nnumber are parametrically large,\nE = \u1ebc/\u03bb ,\n\nN = \u00d1 /\u03bb ,\n\nwhere \u1ebc and \u00d1 are held constant as \u03bb \u2192 0. The transition probability has the exponential form\n1\n\nT = De\u2212 \u03bb F (\u1ebc, \u00d1 ) ,\nwhere D is a pre-exponential factor, which we do not\nconsider in this paper. Our purpose is to calculate the\nleading semiclassical exponent F (\u1ebc, \u00d1 ). The exponent\nfor tunneling from the oscillator ground state [11, 12, 13]\nmay be obtained by taking F (\u1ebc, \u00d1 ) in the limit \u00d1 \u2192 0.\nThe exponent F (\u1ebc, \u00d1 ) is again related to solutions of\nthe complexified classical boundary value problem. The\nderivation is similar to that given in Sec. II A; we present\nthe details in App. A. The outcome is as follows. In addition to the Lagrange multiplier T one now has another\nLagrange multiplier \u03b8 which is related to the new parameter N characterizing the incoming\nstate.\n\u221a\n\u221a We again\nrescale the variables, X \u2192 X/ \u03bb, y \u2192 y/ \u03bb, and omit\ntilde over the rescaled quantities \u1ebc, \u00d1 . As above, the\nboundary value problem is conveniently formulated on\nthe contour ABCD in the complex time plane (see Fig. 3),\nwith the imaginary part of the initial time equal to T /2.\nThe coordinates X(t), y(t) must satisfy the complexified\n\n\u03b4S\n\u03b4S\n=\n=0,\n\u03b4X(t)\n\u03b4y(t)\n\n(29a)\n\nIm y(t) \u2192 0,\n\n(29b)\n\nIm X(t) \u2192 0,\n\nas t \u2192 +\u221e .\n\nIn the asymptotic past (region A of the contour, where\nt = t\u2032 + iT /2, t\u2032 is real negative) one can neglect the\ninteraction potential Uint , and the oscillator decouples:\n\u2032\n\u2032\n1\ny = \u221a (ue\u2212i\u03c9t + vei\u03c9t ).\n2\u03c9\n\nThe boundary conditions in the asymptotic past, t\u2032 \u2192\n\u2212\u221e, are that the center-of-mass coordinate X must be\nreal, while the complex amplitudes of the decoupled oscillator must be linearly related,\nIm X \u2192 0,\nv \u2192 e\u03b8 u \u2217 ,\n\nas t\u2032 \u2192 \u2212\u221e .\n\n(29c)\n\nThe boundary conditions (29b) and (29c) make, in fact,\neight real conditions (since, e.g., Im X(t\u2032 ) \u2192 0 implies\nthat both Im X and Im \u1e8a tend to zero), and completely\ndetermine a solution, up to time translation invariance\n(see discussion in App. A).\nIt is shown in App. A that a solution to this boundary\nvalue problem is, in fact, an extremum of the functional\n(cf. (10))\nF [X, y; X \u2217 , y \u2217 ; T, \u03b8] = \u2212iS[X, y] + iS[X \u2217 , y \u2217 ]\n\u2212 ET \u2212 N \u03b8 + Boundary terms .\n\n(30)\n\nThe value of this functional at the extremum gives the\nexponent for the transition probability\nF (E, N ) = 2 Im S0 (T, \u03b8) \u2212 ET \u2212 N \u03b8 ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere S0 is the action of the solution (integrated by parts,\nsee App. A),\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n1 d2 X\n1 d2 y\n1 2 2\nS0 = dt \u2212 X 2 \u2212 y 2 \u2212 \u03c9 y \u2212 Uint (X, y) .\n2 dt\n2 dt\n2\nThe values of the Lagrange multipliers T and \u03b8 are related to energy and excitation number as follows,\n\u2202\n2 Im S0 (T, \u03b8) ,\n\u2202T\n\u2202\n2 Im S0 (T, \u03b8) .\nN (T, \u03b8) =\n\u2202\u03b8\nE(T, \u03b8) =\n\n(32)\n(33)\n\nMaking use of Eq. (31), it is straightforward to check also\nthe inverse Legendre transformation formulas,\n\u2202\nF (E, N ) ,\n\u2202E\n\u2202\n\u03b8(E, N ) = \u2212\nF (E, N ) .\n\u2202N\n\nT (E, N ) = \u2212\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\n\f10\nOne can also check that the right hand side of Eq. (32)\ncoincides with the energy of the classical solution, while\nthe right hand side of Eq. (33) is equal to the classical\ncounterpart of the occupation number,\nE=\n\n\u1e8a 2\n+ \u03c9N ;\n2\n\nN = uv .\n\n(36)\n\nSo, one may either search for the values of T and \u03b8 that\ncorrespond to some given E and N , or, following a computationally simpler procedure, solve the boundary value\nproblem (29) for given T and \u03b8 and then find the corresponding values of E and N from Eq. (36).\nLet us discuss some subtle points of the boundary value\nproblem (29). First, one notices that the condition of\nasymptotic reality (29b) does not always coincide with\nthe condition of reality at finite time. Of course, if the solution approaches the asymptotic region X \u2192 +\u221e on the\npart CD of the contour, the asymptotic reality condition\n(29b) implies that the solution is real at any finite positive t. Indeed, the oscillator decouples as X \u2192 +\u221e, so\nthe condition (29b) means that its phase and amplitude,\nas well as X(t), are real as t \u2192 +\u221e. Due to equations of\nmotion, X(t) and y(t) are real on the entire CD\u2013part of\nthe contour. This situation corresponds to the transition\ndirectly to the asymptotic region X \u2192 +\u221e. However,\nthe situation can be drastically different if the solution\non the final part of the time contour remains in the interaction region. For example, let us imagine that the solution approaches the saddle point of the potential X = 0,\ny = 0 as t \u2192 +\u221e. Since one of the excitations about\nthis point is unstable, there may exist solutions which\napproach this point exponentially along the unstable direction, i.e. X(t), y(t) \u221d e\u2212const*t with possibly complex\npre-factors. In this case the solution may be complex at\nany finite time, and become real only asymptotically, as\nt \u2192 +\u221e. Such solution corresponds to tunneling to the\nsaddle point of the barrier, after which the system rolls\ndown classically towards X \u2192 +\u221e (with probability of\norder 1, inessential for the tunneling exponent F ). We\nwill see in Sec. IV A that the situation of this sort indeed takes place for some values of energy and excitation\nnumber.\nSecond, since at large negative time (in the asymptotic\nregion X \u2192 \u2212\u221e) the interaction potential disappears,\nit is straightforward to continue the asymptotics of the\nsolution to the real time axis. For solutions satisfying\n(29c) this gives at large negative time\n\u0011\n\u03c9T\n1 \u0010 \u2212 \u03c9T \u2212i\u03c9t\n+ u\u2217 e\u03b8+ 2 ei\u03c9t ,\nue 2 e\ny(t) = \u221a\n2\u03c9\nT\nIm X(t) = \u2212i pX .\n2\nWe see that the dynamical coordinates on the negative\nside of the real time axis are generally complex. For solutions approaching the asymptotic region X \u2192 +\u221e as\nt \u2192 +\u221e (so that X and y are exactly real at finite t > 0),\nthis means, in complete analogy to the one-dimensional\n\ncase, that there should exist a branch point in the complex time plane: the contour in Fig. 3 winds around this\npoint and cannot be deformed to the real time axis. This\nargument does not work for solutions ending in the interaction region as t \u2192 +\u221e, so branch points between\nthe AB\u2013part of the contour and the real time axis may\nbe absent. We will see in Sec. IV A that this is indeed\nthe case in our model for a certain range of E and N .\n\nB.\n\nOver-barrier transitions: boundary of the\nclassically allowed region E0 (N )\n\nBefore studying the exponentially suppressed transitions, let us consider the classically allowed ones. To this\nend, let us study the classical evolution, in which the\nsystem is initially located at large negative X and moves\nwith positive center-of-mass velocity towards the asymptotic region X \u2192 +\u221e. The classical dynamics of the system is specified by four initial parameters. One of them\n(e.g., the initial center-of-mass coordinate) fixes the invariance under time translation, while the other three are\nthe total energy E, the initial excitation number of the\ny\u2013oscillator, defined in classical theory as N \u2261 Eosc /\u03c9,\nand the initial oscillator phase \u03c6i .\nThe classically allowed region is the region of the E\u2013\nN plane where over\u2013barrier transitions are possible for\nsome value(s) of the initial oscillator phase3 . For given\nN , at large enough E the system can certainly evolve to\nthe other side of the barrier. On the other hand, if E\nis smaller than the barrier height, the system definitely\nundergoes reflection. Thus, there exists some boundary\nenergy E0 (N ), such that classical transitions are possible\nfor E > E0 (N ), while for E < E0 (N ) they do not occur\nfor any initial phase \u03c6i . The line E0 (N ) represents the\nboundary of the classically allowed region. We have calculated E0 (N ) numerically for \u03c9 = 0.5: the result is\nshown in Fig. 2 and reproduced in Fig. 9\nAn important point of the boundary E0 (N ) corresponds to the static unstable classical solution X(t) =\ny(t) = 0, the sphaleron (cf. Refs. [10, 14]). It is\nthe saddle point of the potential U (X, y) \u2261 \u03c9 2 y 2 /2 +\nUint (X, y) and has exactly one unstable direction, the\nnegative mode (see Fig. 8). The sphaleron energy ES =\nU (0, 0) = 1 determines the minimum value of the function E0 (N ). Indeed, while classical over\u2013barrier transitions with E < ES are impossible, the over\u2013barrier solution with slightly higher energy can be obtained as follows: at the point X = y = 0, one adds momentum along\nthe negative mode, thus \"pushing\" the system towards\nX \u2192 +\u221e. Continuing this solution backwards in time\none finds that the system tends to X \u2192 \u2212\u221e for large\n\n3\n\nNote that the corresponding classical solutions obey the boundary conditions (29b), (29c) with T = \u03b8 = 0, i.e., they are solutions to the boundary value problem (29).\n\n\f11\n\nC.\n\nSuppressed transitions: bifurcation line E1 (N )\n\nLet us now turn to classically forbidden transitions,\nand consider the boundary value problem (29). It is relatively straightforward to obtain numerically solutions\nfor \u03b8 = 0. The boundary conditions (29b), (29c) in this\ncase take the form of reality conditions in the asymptotic\nfuture and past. It can be shown (see Ref. [15]) that the\nphysically relevant solutions with \u03b8 = 0 are real on the\nentire contour ABCD of Fig. 3 and describe nonlinear oscillations in the upside-down potential on the Euclidean\npart BC of the contour. The period of the oscillations is\nequal to T , so that the points B and C are two different\nturning points, where \u1e8a = \u1e8f = 0. These real Euclidean\nsolutions are called periodic instantons (see Ref. [15]). A\npractical technique for obtaining these solutions numerically on the Euclidean part BC consists in minimizing\nthe Euclidean action (for example with the method of\nconjugate gradients, see Ref. [9] for details). The solutions on the entire contour are then obtained by solving\n\nU(X,y)\n\n0\n1\n\ny-X\n\n0\n0\n\ny+X\n\nFIG. 8: The potential (dotted lines) in the vicinity of the\nsphaleron (X = 0, y = 0) (marked by the point), excited\nsphaleron (thick line) corresponding to the point (E, N ) =\n(1.985, 3.72) at the boundary of the classically allowed region, and the trajectory of the solution which is close to this\nexcited sphaleron (thin line). In this figure the asymptotic\nregions X \u2192 \u00b1\u221e are along the diagonal.\n\nNS\n\n0.6\n\nN\n\nnegative time and has a certain oscillator excitation number. Solutions with energy closer to the sphaleron energy\ncorrespond to smaller \"push\" and thus spend longer time\nnear the sphaleron. In the limiting case when the energy\nis equal to ES , the solution spends an infinite time in the\nvicinity of the sphaleron. This limiting case has a definite initial excitation number NS , so that E0 (NS ) = ES\n(see Fig. 9). The value of NS is unique because there\nis exactly one negative direction of the potential in the\nvicinity of the sphaleron.\nIn complete analogy to the features of the over\u2013barrier\nclassical solutions near the sphaleron point (ES , NS ), one\nexpects that as the values of E, N approach any other\nboundary point (E0 (N ), N ), the corresponding over\u2013\nbarrier solutions will spend more and more time in the\ninteraction region, where Uint 6= 0. This again follows\nfrom a continuity argument. Namely, let us first fix the\ninitial and final times, ti and tf . If in this time interval\na solution with energy E1 evolves to the other side of\nthe barrier and a solution with energy E2 and the same\noscillator excitation number is reflected back, there exists an intermediate energy at which the solution ends\nup at t = tf in the interaction region. Taking the limit\ntf \u2192 +\u221e and (E1 \u2212 E2 ) \u2192 0, we obtain a point at the\nboundary of the classically allowed region and a solution\ntending asymptotically to some unstable time dependent\nsolution that spends infinite time in the interaction region. We call the latter solution excited sphaleron; it describes some (in general nonlinear) oscillations above the\nsphaleron along the stable direction in coordinate space.\nTherefore, every point of the boundary (E0 (N ), N ) corresponds to some excited sphaleron.\nWe display in Fig. 8 a solution, found numerically in\nour model, that tends to an excited sphaleron. We see\nthat this trajectory is, roughly speaking, orthogonal to\nthe unstable direction at the saddle point (X = 0, y = 0).\n\nEPI(N)\n\n0.2\nE1(N)\n0\n\nES = 1\n\n0.5\n\nE0(N)\n1.5\n\nE\n\nFIG. 9: The boundary of the classically allowed region E0 (N ),\nthe bifurcation line E1 (N ) and the line of the periodic instantons EP I (N ).\n\nnumerically the Cauchy problem, forward in time along\nthe line CD and backward in time along the line BA.\nHaving the solution in asymptotic past (region A), one\nthen calculates its energy and excitation number (36).\nThe solutions to this Cauchy problem are obviously real,\nso the boundary conditions (29b), (29c) are indeed satisfied with \u03b8 = 0. It is worth noting that solutions with\n\u03b8 = 0 are similar to the ones in quantum mechanics of\none degree of freedom, see Fig. 4. The line of periodic\ninstantons in E\u2013N plane in our model is shown in Fig. 9,\nagain for \u03c9 = 0.5.\nOnce the solutions with \u03b8 = 0 are found, it is natural to try to cover the entire classically forbidden region of the E \u2212 N plane with a deformation procedure,\nby moving in small steps in \u03b8 (and T ). The solution\nto the boundary value problem with (T + \u2206T, \u03b8 + \u2206\u03b8)\nmay be obtained numerically, by applying an iteration\n\n\f12\n30\n20\n\nPhysical\n\nRe X\n\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\n\nReflected\n\n-30\n-40\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nRe t\n\nFIG. 10: The dependence of the tunneling coordinate X\non time for two solutions with nearly the same energy and\ninitial excitation number.

The physical solution\nhas E = 1.028, N = 0.44, while the unphysical one has\nE = 1.034, N = 0.44. These two solutions are close to the\npoint at the bifurcation line E1 (N = 0.44) = 1.031.\n\ntechnique, with the known solution at (T, \u03b8) serving as\nthe zeroth-order approximation4. Provided the solutions\nhave correct \"topology\" at each step, i.e. X \u2192 \u2212\u221e and\nX \u2192 +\u221e on parts A and D of the contour, the solutions\nobtained by this \"walking\" procedure are physically relevant. However, the \"walking\" method fails to produce\nrelevant solution if there are bifurcation points, where\nthe physical branch of solutions merges to an unphysical\nbranch. As there are unphysical solutions close to physical ones in the vicinity of a bifurcation point, one cannot\n\"walk\" near these points.\nIn our model, the walking method produces correct\nsolutions to the T /\u03b8 boundary value problem in a large\nregion of the E \u2212 N plane, where E < E1 (N ). However, at sufficiently high energy E > E1 (N ), where\nE1 (N ) & ES , the deformation procedure generates solutions that bounce back from the barrier (see Fig. 10),\ni.e. have the wrong \"topology\". Clearly, the latter do not\ndescribe the tunneling transitions of interest. Therefore,\nif the semiclassical method is applicable at all in the region E1 (N ) < E < E0 (N ), there exists another, physical\nbranch of solutions. In that case the line E1 (N ) is the\nbifurcation line, where the physical solutions \"meet\" the\nones with wrong \"topology\". Walking in small steps in\n\u03b8 and T is useless in the vicinity of this bifurcation line,\nand one needs to introduce some trick to find the relevant\nsolutions beyond that line. The bifurcation line E1 (N )\nfor our quantum mechanical problem of two degrees of\nfreedom with \u03c9 = 0.5 is shown in Fig. 9.\nThe loss of topology beyond a certain bifurcation line\nin E \u2212 N plane is by no means a property of our model\nonly. This phenomenon has been observed in field theory\n\n4\n\nIn practice, the Newton\u2013Raphson method is particularly convenient (see Refs. [9], [1], [2]).\n\nmodels, in the context of both induced false vacuum decay [1] and baryon-number violating transitions in gauge\ntheory [2] (in field-theoretic models, the parameter N is\nthe number of incoming particles). In all cases, the loss\nof topology prevented one to compute the semiclassical\nexponent for the transition probability in an interesting\nregion of relatively high energies, where the suppression\nof tunneling may be fairly weak.\nComing back to the quantum mechanics of two degrees of freedom, we point out that the properties of tunneling solutions approaching the bifurcation line E1 (N )\nfrom the left, are in some sense similar to the properties of tunneling solutions in one-dimensional quantum\nmechanics near the boundary of the classically allowed\nregion. Again by continuity, these solutions of our twodimensional model spend a long time in the interaction\nregion; this time tends to infinity on the line E1 (N ).\nHence, on any point of this line, there is a solution that\nstarts in the asymptotic region left of the barrier, and\nends up on an excited sphaleron. We already mentioned\nin Sec. III A that such a behavior is indeed possible because of the existence of an unstable direction near the\n(excited) sphaleron, even for complex initial data. We\nhave suggested in Sec. II B a trick to deal with this\nsituation-this is our regularization technique.\n\nIV.\n\nREGULARIZATION TECHNIQUE\n\nIn this Section we further develop our regularization\ntechnique, and find the physically relevant solutions between the lines E1 (N ) and E0 (N ). We will see that all\nsolutions from the new branch (and not only on the lines\nE0 (N ) and E1 (N )) correspond to tunneling onto the excited sphaleron. These solutions would be very difficult,\nif at all possible, to obtain directly, by solving numerically the non-regularized classical boundary value problem (29): they are complex at finite times, and become\nreal only asymptotically as t \u2192 +\u221e, whereas numerical\nmethods require working with finite time intervals.\nAs an additional advantage, our regularization technique enables one to obtain a family of the over\u2013barrier\nsolutions, that covers all the classically allowed region, including its boundary. This may be of interest in models\nwith large number of degrees of freedom and in field theory, where finding the boundary of the classically allowed\nregion by direct methods is difficult (see e.g., Ref. [16] for\ndiscussion of this point).\n\nA.\n\nRegularized problem in the classically forbidden\nregion\n\nThe main idea of our method is to \"regularize\" the\nequations of motion by adding a term proportional to a\nsmall parameter \u01eb so that configurations staying for an\ninfinite time near the sphaleron no longer exist among\nthe solutions of the T /\u03b8 boundary value problem. After\n\n\f13\nperforming the regularization we explore all the classically forbidden region without crossing the bifurcation\nline. Taking then the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 we reconstruct the correct values of F , E and N .\nWhen formulating the regularization technique it\nis more convenient to work with the functional\nF [X, y; X \u2217 , y \u2217 ; T, \u03b8] itself rather than with the equations\nof motion. We slightly modify the form of F , Eq. (30),\nso that F is no longer extremized by configurations approaching the excited sphalerons asymptotically. To\nachieve this, we add to the original functional (30) a\nnew term of the form 2\u01ebTint , where Tint estimates the\ntime the solution \"spends\" in the interaction region.\nThe parameter of regularization \u01eb is the smallest one\nin the problem, so any regular extremum of the functional F (the solution that spends finite time in the region\nUint 6= 0) changes only slightly after the regularization.\nAt the same time, the excited sphaleron configuration\nhas Tint = \u221e which leads infinite value of the regularized\nfunctional F\u01eb \u2261 F +2\u01ebTint . Hence, the excited sphalerons\nare not stationary points of the regularized functional.\nFor the problem at hand, Uint \u223c 1 in the interaction\nregion, and Tint can be defined as follows,\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\nZ\n1\ndt Uint (X, y) + dt Uint (X \u2217 , y \u2217 ) . (37)\nTint =\n2\nWe notice that Tint is real, and that the regularization is\nequivalent to the multiplication of the interaction potential by a complex factor\nUint \u2192 (1 \u2212 i\u01eb)Uint = e\u2212i\u01eb Uint + O(\u01eb2 ) .\n\n(38)\n\nThis results in the corresponding change of the classical equations of motion, while the boundary conditions (29b), (29c) remain unaltered.\nWe still have to understand whether solutions with\n\u01eb 6= 0 exist at all. The reason for the existence of such\nsolutions is as follows. Let us consider a well-defined (for\n\u01eb > 0) matrix element\nT\u01eb =\n\nlim\n\ntf \u2212ti \u2192\u221e\n\nX\nf\n\nhf |e(\u2212i\u0124\u2212\u01ebUint )(tf \u2212ti ) |E, N i\n\n2\n\n,\n\nwhere |E, N i denotes, as before, the incoming state with\ngiven energy and number of particles. The quantity T\u01eb\nhas a well defined limit as \u01eb \u2192 0, equal to the tunneling\nprobability (28). As the saddle point of the regularized\nfunctional F\u01eb \u2261 F + 2\u01ebTint gives the semiclassical exponent for the quantity T\u01eb , one expects that such saddle\npoint indeed exists.\nTherefore, the regularized T /\u03b8 boundary value problem is expected to have solutions necessarily spending\nfinite time in the interaction region. By continuity, these\nsolutions do not experience reflection from the barrier, if\none makes use of the \"walking\" procedure starting from\nsolutions with correct \"topology\". The line E1 (N ) is no\nlonger a bifurcation line of the regularized system, so the\n\nwalking procedure enables one to cover the entire forbidden region. The semiclassical suppression factor of the\noriginal problem is recovered in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0.\nIt is worth noting that the interaction time is Legendre\nconjugate to \u01eb,\nTint =\n\n1 \u2202\nF\u01eb (E, N, \u01eb) .\n2 \u2202\u01eb\n\n(39)\n\nUseful equations can also be obtained from Eqs. (32) and\n(33):\n\u2202Tint\n+ O(\u01eb) ,\n\u2202T\n\u2202Tint\n+ O(\u01eb) .\nN = N |\u01eb=0 + 2\u01eb\n\u2202\u03b8\nE = E|\u01eb=0 + 2\u01eb\n\n(40)\n(41)\n\nThese equations show how the values of E and N change\nwith \u01eb-away from the would-be bifurcation line E1 (N )\nthe values of E and N depend slightly on \u01eb, while at\nE \u223c E1 (N ) where Tint takes large values (for small \u01eb),\nthe dependence is strong and results in a considerable\nshift of the point (E, N ). Eqs. (39), (40), (41) may be\nused as a check of numerical calculations.\nWe implemented the regularization procedure numerically. To solve the boundary value problem, we make\nuse of the computational methods described in Ref. [13].\nIn our calculations we used \u03c9 = 0.5. To obtain the\nsemiclassical tunneling exponent in the region between\nthe bifurcation line E1 (N ) and boundary of the allowed\nregion, E0 (N ), we began with a solution to the nonregularized problem deep in the forbidden region (i.e.,\nat E < E1 (N )). For that value of T and \u03b8 we increased\nthe value of \u01eb from zero to a certain small positive number. Then we changed T and \u03b8 in small steps, keeping\n\u01eb finite, and found solutions to the regularized problem\nin the region E1 (N ) < E < E0 (N ). These solutions\nhad correct \"topology\", i.e. they indeed ended up in the\nasymptotic region X \u2192 +\u221e. Finally, we lowered \u01eb and\nextrapolated F , E and N to the limit \u01eb \u2192 0.\nThe lines T = const for \u01eb = 0.002 are shown in Fig. 11.\nWe see that at \u01eb 6= 0 these lines are smooth and extend\nfrom \u03b8 = 0 (the line of periodic instantons) to \u03b8 = \u221e\n(the line N = 0). They indeed cover all the tunneling\nregion without any irregularities at the bifurcation line\nE1 (N ).\nThe same lines T = const, but now in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0\nare shown in Fig. 12; the lines \u03b8 = const, again in the\nlimit \u01eb \u2192 0, are presented in Fig. 13. It is seen that\nthe functions T (E, N ) and \u03b8(E, N ) are continuous, while\ntheir first derivatives have discontinuities at the bifurcation line E1 (N ). As T and \u03b8 are the derivatives of\nthe tunneling exponent F (E, N ), see Eqs. (34), (35), the\nsuppression exponent F itself has discontinuities of the\nsecond derivatives only. The lines F = const are shown\nin Fig. 14. We see that the function F and its first derivatives are indeed continuous.\nLet us consider more carefully the solutions in the region E1 (N ) < E < E0 (N ) which we obtain in the limit\n\u01eb \u2192 0.

Indeed, we found that,\nas the value of \u01eb decreases to zero, the solution at any\npoint (E, N ) with E1 (N ) < E < E0 (N ) spends more\nand more time in the interaction region. The limiting\nsolution corresponding to \u01eb = 0 has infinite interaction\ntime: in other words, it tends, as t \u2192 +\u221e, to one of\nthe excited sphalerons. The resulting physical picture is\nthat at large enough energy (i.e., at E > E1 (N )), the\nsystem prefers to tunnel exactly onto an unstable classical solution, excited sphaleron, that oscillates about the\ntop of the potential barrier! To demonstrate this, we\nhave plotted in Fig. 15 the solution ~x(t) \u2261 (X(t), y(t))\nat large times, after taking numerically the limit \u01eb \u2192 0.\nTo understand this figure, one recalls that the potential\nnear the sphaleron point X = y = 0 has one positive\n\nmode and one negative mode. Namely, by introducing\nnew coordinates c+ , c\u2212 ,\nX = cos \u03b1 c+ + sin \u03b1 c\u2212 ,\ny = \u2212 sin \u03b1 c+ + cos \u03b1 c\u2212 ,\n\u03c92\n,\nctg2\u03b1 = \u2212\n2\none writes, in the vicinity of the sphaleron,\nH =1+\n\np2+\np2\n\u03c92\n\u03c92\n+ \u2212 + + c2+ \u2212 \u2212 c2\u2212 ,\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\nwhere\n\u03c92\n\u03c9\u00b1 = \u22121 +\n\u00b1\n2\n\nr\n\n1+\n\n\u03c94\n.\n4\n\nSince the solutions to the T /\u03b8 boundary value problem\nare complex, the coordinates c+ and c\u2212 are complex too.\nWe show in Fig. 15 real and imaginary parts of c+ and\nc\u2212 at large real time t (part CD of the contour).

The solutions to the full stationary Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation may be found numerically in this case at finite\nvalues of the semiclassical parameter \u03bb, and the results\nmay be extrapolated to \u03bb \u2192 0. The suppression factor may be then compared to the semiclassical result.\nWe performed this check in the region E > ES = 1,\nwhich is most interesting for our purposes. We applied\nthe numerical techniques for solving the full stationary\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, which were developed in Ref. [8];\nour results agree with Ref. [8] where comparison is possible. The results of the full quantum mechanical calcula-\n\ntunneling\nTS\n\nreflection\n\nT\n\nsee that while Re c+ oscillates, the unstable coordinate\nc\u2212 approaches asymptotically the sphaleron value: c\u2212 \u2192\n0 as t \u2192 +\u221e. The imaginary part of c\u2212 is non-zero\nat any finite time. This is the reason for the failure of\nstraightforward numerical methods in the region E >\nE1 (N ): the solutions from the physical branch do not\nsatisfy the conditions of reality at any large but finite\nfinal time. We have pointed out in Sec. III A that this can\nhappen only if the solution ends up near the sphaleron,\nwhich has a negative mode.\nIt is interesting to compare the branches of solutions in\nthe two\u2013 and one\u2013dimensional models (the latter was discussed in Sec. II). The dependence T (E) in these models\nis shown in Fig. 16 (for the two dimensional problem the\ngraph corresponds to constant oscillator excitation number N = 0.1). We see that the structure of the branches is\nsimilar, though in the one\u2013dimensional case the solutions\ncorresponding to \"tunneling\" onto the sphaleron are degenerate in energy and are not really useful for finding\nthe transition exponent. In the two\u2013dimensional model,\non the other hand, the similar branch is the one relevant\nat E1 (N ) < E < E0 (N ).\n\n\"tunneling\"\nonto\nsphaleron\n\n2\n\nreflection\n\nover-barrier\n\n0\n\nES = 1\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\nE\n\n(b)\nFIG. 16: Dependence of the parameter T = \u2212\u2202F/\u2202E on\nenergy for (a) the two dimensional model with fixed N = 0.1\nand (b)the one dimensional model.

The lines across the plot are the\nboundary of the classically allowed region E0 (N ) and the bifurcation line E1 (N ).\n\nple, finding this boundary is purely a problem of classical\nmechanics, and, indeed, in mechanics of two degrees of\nfreedom one obtains this boundary numerically by solving numerically the Cauchy problem for given E and N\nand all possible oscillator phases, see Sec. III B. However, if the number of degrees of freedom is much larger,\nthis classical problem becomes quite complicated, as one\nhas to span a high-dimensional space of Cauchy data.\nAs an example, a stochastic Monte Carlo technique was\ndeveloped in Ref. [16] to deal with this problem in field\ntheory context. The approach below may be viewed as\nan alternative to the Cauchy methods.\nFirst, let us recall that all classical over\u2013barrier solutions with given energy and excitation number satisfy\nthe T /\u03b8 boundary value problem with T = 0, \u03b8 = 0. We\ncannot reach the allowed region of E \u2212 N plane without\nregularization, because we have to cross the line E0 (N )\ncorresponding to the excited sphaleron configurations in\nthe final state. However, the excited sphalerons no longer\nexist among the solutions of the regularized boundary\nvalue problem at any finite value of \u01eb. This suggests that\nthe regularization enables one to enter the classically allowed region and, after taking an appropriate limit, obtain classical solutions with finite values of E, N .\nBy definition, the classically allowed transitions have\nF = 0. Thus, one expects that in the allowed region, the\nregularized problem has the property that F\u01eb (E, N ) =\n\u01ebf (E, N ) + O(\u01eb2 ). In view of the inverse Legendre formulas (34), (35) the values of T and \u03b8 must be of order \u01eb:\nT = \u01eb\u03c4 (E, N ), \u03b8 = \u01eb\u03b8(E, N ), where the quantities \u03c4 and\n\u03b8 are related to the initial energy and excitation number\n\n(42)\n(43)\n\nand we have used the form (38) of the regularized potential. Therefore, one expects that one can invade the\nclassically allowed region by taking a fairly sophisticated\nlimit \u01eb \u2192 0 with \u03c4 \u2261 T /\u01eb = const, \u03b8 \u2261 \u03b8/\u01eb = const. In\nthe allowed region the parameters \u03c4 and \u03b8 are analogous\nto T and \u03b8.\nBy solving the regularized T /\u03b8 boundary value problem one constructs a single solution for given E and N .\nOn the other hand, for \u01eb = 0 there are more classical\nover\u2013barrier solutions: they form a continuous family labeled by the initial oscillator phase. Thus, after taking\nthe limit \u01eb \u2192 0 one obtains a subset of over\u2013barrier solutions, which should therefore obey some additional constraint. It is almost obvious, that this constraint is that\nthe interaction time Tint , Eq. (37), is minimal. This is\nshown in App. B.\nThe subset of classical over\u2013barrier solutions obtained\nin the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 of the regularized T /\u03b8 procedure extends all the way to the boundary of the classically allowed region. Let us see what happens when one approaches this boundary from the classically allowed side.\nAt the boundary E0 (N ), the unregularized solutions tend\nto excited sphalerons, so the interaction time Tint is infinite. This is consistent with (42), (43) only if \u03c4 and \u03b8\nbecome infinite at the boundary. Thus, to obtain a point\nof the boundary one takes the further limit,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nE(\u03c4, \u03b8), N (\u03c4, \u03b8) .\nE0 (N ), N = lim\n\u03c4 /\u03b8=const\n\u03c4 \u2192+\u221e\n\nDifferent values of \u03c4 /\u03b8 correspond to different points of\nthe line E0 (N ). In this way one finds the boundary of the\nclassically allowed region without an initial-state simulation.\nWe have checked this procedure numerically. The line\n\u03c4 = const, \u03b8 = const, with varying \u01eb, is shown in Fig. 18.\nThe limit \u01eb \u2192 0 exists indeed-the values of E and N\ntend to the point (c) of the classically allowed region.\nThe phase of the tunneling coordinate X(t) in complex\ntime plane is shown in Fig. 19 for the three points (a),\n(b) and (c) of the curve Fig. 18. The branch points of\nthe solution5 , the cuts and the contour are clearly seen\non these graphs.\nIt is worth noting that the left branch points t\u2217\u2212 move\ndown as T and \u03b8 approach zero. Solutions to the right of\nthe point (b) (along the curve of Fig. 18) have left branch\n\n5\n\nThe phase of the tunneling coordinate turns by \u03c0 around the\nbranch point.

Therefore, the corresponding contour may be continuously deformed to the real time axis. These solutions still satisfy\nthe reality conditions asymptotically (see Fig. 15), but\nshow nontrivial complex behavior at any finite time.\nMaking use of the regularized T /\u03b8 procedure, one is\nable to approach the boundary of the classically allowed\nregion from both sides. The points at this boundary may\nbe obtained by taking the limits T \u2192 0, T /\u03b8 = const of\nthe tunneling solutions and \u03c4 \u2192 +\u221e, \u03c4 /\u03b8 = const of\nthe classically allowed ones. As \u03c4 \u2217 \u2261 \u03c4 /\u03b8 = T /\u03b8 by\nconstruction, the lines \u03c4 \u2217 = const are continuous at the\nboundary E0 (N ), though may have discontinuity of the\nderivatives. These lines are shown in Fig. 20. We see\nthat the variable \u03c4 \u2217 can be used to parametrize the curve\nE0 (N ).\nFor completeness, the lines \u03c4 = const and \u03b8 = const in\nthe classically allowed region are presented in Figs. 13, 14.\n\n(c)\n\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n0\n\nFIG. 19: The phase of the tunneling coordinate in complex\ntime plane at the three points of the curve \u03c4 = const, \u03b8 =\nconst (see Fig. 18).

At these energies,\nit is energetically allowed that the system jumps above\nthe barrier, and restarts its classical evolution from the\nregion near its saddle point. This is precisely what we\nhave observed. From the physical viewpoint, this is not\nquite what is normally meant by \"tunneling through a\nbarrier\". Yet the transitions remain exponentially sup-\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nE\n\nFIG. 20: Lines T /\u03b8 = const are continuously connected with\nthe lines \u03c4 /\u03b8 = const. The numbers near the lines give the\nvalues of T /\u03b8 = \u03c4 /\u03b8.\n\n\f18\npressed (until the energy reaches the boundary of the\nallowed region), but, intuitively, the reason is different:\nto jump above the barrier, the system has to undergo\nconsiderable rearrangement, unless the incoming state\nis chosen properly (i.e. unless the oscillator excitation\nnumber in our model is large enough). This rearrangement costs exponentially small probability factor. We\nnote that similar exponential factor was argued to appear in various field theory processes with multi-particle\nfinal states [17, 18, 19, 20].\nThe T /\u03b8 boundary value problem, equipped with our\nregularization technique, enables one to deal with this\nsituation, which, in the language of complex classical solutions, corresponds to a new physically relevant branch.\nThe regularization procedure chooses automatically the\ncorrect branch, and thus provides an efficient way to cross\nthe bifurcation lines where different branches merge. The\nphenomenon discussed in this paper appears to be quite\ngeneral, as it exists in diverse quantum systems, from\ntwo-dimensional quantum mechanics to quantum field\ntheory. The appropriate generalization of our regularized T /\u03b8 procedure is straightforward; we are going to\nreport on this application to baryon\u2013number violating\nprocesses in gauge theory in future publication [7].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are indebted to V.

Let the incoming\nstate |E, N i\u03b4 have fixed energy and oscillator excitation\nnumber, and has support only for X \u226a 0, well outside\nthe range of the potential barrier. The inclusive tunneling probability for states of this type is given by\n\nT (E, N ) =\n\nlim\n\ntf \u2212ti \u2192\u221e\n\n(Z\n+\u221e\n+\u221e\nZ\ndXf\ndyf\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nhXf , yf |e\n\n\u2212i\u0124(tf \u2212ti )\n\n|E, N i\n\n2\n\n)\n\n. (A1)\n\nThis probability can be reexpressed in terms of the transition amplitudes\nAf i = hXf , yf |e\u2212iH(tf \u2212ti ) |Xi , yi i\n\n(A2)\n\nand initial-state matrix elements\nBii\u2032 = hXi , yi |E, N ihE, N |Xi\u2032 , yi\u2032 i\n\n(A3)\n\nin the following way,\n\nT (E, N ) =\n\nlim\n\ntf \u2212ti \u2192\u221e\n\n(Z\n+\u221e\nZ0\ndXf\ndXi dXi\u2032\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n)\n+\u221e\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2217\ndyi dyi dyf Af i Ai\u2032 f Bii\u2032 . (A4)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe transition amplitude and its complex conjugate have\nthe familiar path integral representation:\nAf i =\n\nZ\n\n[d~x]\n\nA\u2217i\u2032 f =\n\nZ\n\n[dx~\u2032 ]\n\neiS[~x] ,\n\n(A5)\n\n~\nx(ti )=~\nxi\n~\nx(tf )=~\nxf\n\n~\u2032\n\n~\nx\u2032 (ti )=~\nx\u2032i\n~\nx\u2032 (tf )=~\nxf\n\ne\u2212iS[x ] ,\n\nwhere ~x = (X, y), and S is the action of the model. To\nobtain a similar representation for the initial-state matrix\nelements let us rewrite Bii\u2032 as follows,\nBii\u2032 = hXi , yi |P\u0302E P\u0302N |Xi\u2032 , yi\u2032 i ,\n\n(A6)\n\nwhere P\u0302N and P\u0302E denote the projectors onto states with\noscillator excitation number N and total energy E respectively. It is convenient to use the coherent state formalism for the y-oscillator and choose the momentum\nbasis for the X-coordinate. In this representation, the\nkernel of the projector operator P\u0302E P\u0302N takes the form\nZ\n1\nd\u03be d\u03b7\nhq, b|P\u0302E P\u0302N |p, ai =\n(2\u03c0)2\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni 2\ni\u03c9\u03be+i\u03b7\nb\u0304a \u03b4(q \u2212 p) ,\nexp \u2212iE\u03be \u2212 iN \u03b7 + p \u03be + e\n2\n\n\f19\nwhere |p, ai is the eigenstate of the center-of-mass momentum p\u0302X and y-oscillator annihilation operator \u00e2 with\neigenvalues p and a respectively. It is straightforward to\nexpress this matrix element in the coordinate representation using the formulas\nr\n\n\u03c9 \u2212 1 a2 +\u221a2\u03c9ay\u2212 1 \u03c9y2\n2\n,\ne 2\n\u03c0\n1\nhX|pi = \u221a eipX .\n2\u03c0\nhy|ai =\n\n4\n\nEvaluating the Gaussian integrals over a, b, p, q, we obtain\n\u0012\nZ\ni (Xi \u2212 Xi\u2032 )2\nd\u03be d\u03b7 exp \u2212iE\u03be \u2212 iN \u03b7 \u2212\nBii\u2032 =\n2\n\u03be\n\u0014 2\n\u20322\n\u03c9\nyi + yi\n+\n(1 + e\u22122i\u03c9\u03be\u22122i\u03b7 )\n1 \u2212 e\u22122i\u03c9\u03be\u22122i\u03b7\n2\n\u0015\u0013\n\u22122yi yi\u2032 e\u2212i\u03c9\u03be\u2212i\u03b7\n(A7)\nwhere we omit the pre-exponential factor depending on\n\u03b7, \u03be. For the subsequent formulation of the boundary\nvalue problem it is convenient to introduce the notation\nT = \u2212i\u03be ,\n\n\u03b8 = \u2212i\u03b7 .\n\nThen, combining together the integral representations\n(A7) and (A5) and rescaling\n\u221a coordinates, energy and excitation number ~x \u2192 ~x/ \u03bb, E \u2192 E/\u03bb, N \u2192 N/\u03bb, we\nfinally obtain\n\nT (E, N ) =\n\nlim\n\ntf \u2212ti \u2192\u221e\n\n( +i\u221e\nZ\nZ\ndT d\u03b8 [d~x d~x\u2032 ]\n\u2212i\u221e\n\n\u001a\n\u001b)\n1\n\u2032\nexp \u2212 F [~x, ~x ; T, \u03b8]\n, (A8)\n\u03bb\nwhere\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nF [~x, ~x ; T, \u03b8] = \u2212iS[X, y] + iS[X , y ]\n\u2212 ET \u2212 N \u03b8 + Bi (~xi , x~\u2032 i ; T, \u03b8). (A9)\n\n2.\n\nThe boundary value problem\n\nFor small \u03bb, the path integral (A8) is dominated by a\nstationary point of the functional F . Thus, to calculate\nthe tunneling exponent, we extremize this functional with\nrespect to all variables of integration: X(t), y(t), X \u2032 (t),\ny \u2032 (t), T , \u03b8. Note that because of the limit tf \u2212 ti \u2192 +\u221e,\nthe variation with respect to the initial and final values\nof coordinates leads to boundary conditions imposed at\nasymptotic t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, rather than at finite times ti , tf .\nNote also that the stationary points may be complex.\nThe variation of the functional (A9) with respect to\nthe coordinates at intermediate times gives second order\nequations of motion, in general complexified,\n\u03b4S\n\u03b4S \u2032\n\u03b4S \u2032\n\u03b4S\n=\n=\n=\n=0.\n\u03b4X(t)\n\u03b4y(t)\n\u03b4X \u2032 (t)\n\u03b4y \u2032 (t)\n\n(A11a)\n\nThe boundary conditions at the final time tf \u2192 +\u221e are\nobtained by extremization of F with respect to Xf \u2261 Xf\u2032 ,\nyf \u2261 yf\u2032 . These are\nX \u0307f = X \u0307f\u2032 ,\n\ny \u0307f = y \u0307f\u2032 .\n\n(A11b)\n\nIt is convenient to write the conditions at the initial\ntime (obtained by varying Xi , yi , Xi\u2032 , yi\u2032 ) in terms of\nthe asymptotic quantities. At the initial moment of time\nti \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the system moves in the region X \u2192 \u2212\u221e, well\noutside of the range of the potential barrier. Equations\n(A11a) in this region describe free motion of decoupled\noscillator, and the general solution takes the following\nform,\nX(t) = Xi + pi (t \u2212 ti ),\ni\n1 h \u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212ti )\nae\n+ \u0101ei\u03c9(t\u2212ti ) ,\ny(t) = \u221a\n2\u03c9\nwhile the solution for X \u2032 (t), y \u2032 (t) has similar form. For\nthe moment, a and \u0101 are independent variables. The\ninitial boundary conditions in terms of the asymptotic\nvariables Xi , pi , a, \u0101 take the form:\nXi \u2212 Xi\u2032\n,\niT\na\u2032 + \u0101\u2032 = ae\u03c9T +\u03b8 + \u0101e\u2212\u03c9T \u2212\u03b8 ,\na + \u0101 = a\u2032 e\u2212\u03c9T \u2212\u03b8 + \u0101\u2032 e\u03c9T +\u03b8 .\n\npi = p\u2032i = \u2212\n\n(A11c)\n\nHere the non-trivial initial term Bi is\n(Xi \u2212 Xi\u2032 )2\nBi =\n2T\n\u0014\n\u03c9\n1 2\n2\n\u2212\n(y + yi\u2032 )(1 + e2\u03c9T +2\u03b8 )\n2\u03c9T\n+2\u03b8\n1\u2212e\n2 i\n\u0015\n(A10)\n\u2212 2yi yi\u2032 e\u03c9T +\u03b8 .\nIn (A8) ~x and x~\u2032 are independent integration variables,\nwhile ~x\u2032f \u2261 ~xf , see Eqs. (A4).\n\nThe variation with respect to the Lagrange multipliers T\nand \u03b8 gives the relation between the values of E, N and\ninitial asymptotic variables (here we use the boundary\nconditions (A11c)),\np2i\n+ \u03c9N ,\n2\nN = a\u0101 .\nE =\n\n(A11d)\n\nEquations (A11a) \u2013 (A11d) constitute the complete set\nof saddle-point equations for the functional F .\n\n\f20\nThe variables X \u2032 and y \u2032 originate from the conjugate amplitude A\u2217i\u2032 f (see Eq. (A5)), which suggests that\nthey are the complex conjugate to X, y. Indeed, the\nAnsatz X \u2032 (t) = X \u2217 (t), y \u2032 (t) = y \u2217 (t) is compatible with\nthe boundary value problem (A11). Then the Lagrange\nmultipliers T , \u03b8 are real, and the problem (A11) may\nbe conveniently formulated at the contour ABCD in the\ncomplex time plane (see Fig. 3).\nNow we have only two independent complex variables\nX(t) and y(t), that have to satisfy the classical equations\nof motion in the interior of the contour,\n\u03b4S\n\u03b4S\n=\n=0.\n\u03b4X(t)\n\u03b4y(t)\n\n(A12a)\n\nThe final boundary conditions (see Eq. (A11b)) become\nthe conditions of the reality of the variables X(t) and\ny(t) at the asymptotic part D of the contour:\nIm Xf = 0, Im yf = 0 ,\nIm \u1e8af = 0 Im \u1e8ff = 0 ,\n\nt \u2192 +\u221e .\n\n(A12b)\n\nThe seemingly complicated initial conditions (A11c) simplify when written in terms of the time coordinate t\u2032 =\nt+iT /2 running along the part AB of the contour. Let us\nagain write the asymptotics of a solution, but now along\nthe initial part AB of the contour:\nX = X0 + p0 (t\u2032 \u2212 ti ) ,\ni\n\u2032\n1 h \u2212i\u03c9(t\u2032 \u2212ti )\nue\n+ vei\u03c9(t \u2212ti ) .\ny=\u221a\n2\u03c9\nIn terms of X0 , y0 , u and v, the boundary conditions\n(A11c) are\nIm X0 = 0, Im p0 = 0 ,\nv = u \u2217 e\u03b8 .\n\n(A12c)\n\nFinally, we write Eqs. (A11d) in terms of the asymptotic\nvariables along the initial part of the contour:\np20\n+ \u03c9N ,\n2\nN = \u03c9uv .\n\nE=\n\n(A13)\n\nThese equations determine the Lagrange multipliers T, \u03b8\nin terms of E, N . Alternatively, we can solve the problem (A12) for given values of T , \u03b8 and find the values of\nE,N from Eqs. (A13), what is more convenient computationally.\nGiven a solution to the problem (A12), the exponent\nF is the value of the functional (A9) at this saddle point.\nExplicitly\nF = \u2212ET \u2212 N \u03b8 + 2 Im S0 (T, \u03b8) ,\n\n(A14)\n\nwhere S0 is the action of the system, integrated by parts\n\u0015\nZ \u0014\n1 d2\n1 d2\n\u03c92 2\nS0 = dt \u2212 X 2 X \u2212 y 2 y \u2212\ny \u2212 Uint (X, y) .\n2 dt\n2 dt\n2\n\nNote that we did not make use of the constraints (A13) to\nobtain the formula (A14), so we still can extremize (A14)\nwith respect to T and \u03b8 (see discussion in Sec. III A).\nThe classical problem (A12) is conveniently dubbed\nT /\u03b8 boundary value problem. Eqs. (A12b) and (A12c)\nimply eight real boundary conditions for two complex\nsecond-order differential equations (A12a). However, one\nof these real conditions is redundant: Eq. (A12b) implies that the (conserved) energy is real, so the condition\nIm p0 \u2192 0 is automatically satisfied (note that the oscillator energy Eosc = \u03c9uv = \u03c9e\u03b8 uu\u2217 is real). On the\nother hand, the system (A12) is invariant under time\ntranslations along the real axis. This invariance may\nbe fixed, e.g., by demanding that Re(X) takes a prescribed value at a prescribed large negative time t\u20320 (note\nthat other ways may be used instead. In particular, for\nE < E1 (N ) it is convenient to impose the constraint\nRe \u1e8a(t = 0) = 0). Together with the latter requirement,\nwe have exactly eight real boundary conditions for the\nsystem of two complexified (i.e. four real) second-order\nequations.\n\nAPPENDIX B: A PROPERTY OF SOLUTIONS\nTO T /\u03b8 PROBLEM IN THE ALLOWED REGION\n\nFor given E, N there is only one over\u2013barrier classical solution which is obtained in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 of the\nregularized T /\u03b8 procedure. To see what singles out this\nsolution, let us analyze the regularized functional\nF\u01eb [q] = F [q] + 2\u01ebTint[q],\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere q denotes the variables ~x(t), ~x\u2032 (t) and T, \u03b8 together. The unregularized functional F has a valley of\nextrema q e (\u03c6) corresponding to different values of the initial oscillator phase \u03c6. Clearly, at small \u01eb the extremum\nof F\u01eb is close to a point in this valley with the phase\nextremizing Tint [q e (\u03c6)].\nd\nTint [q e (\u03c6)] = 0 .\nd\u03c6\n\n(B2)\n\nHence, the solution q\u01ebe of the regularized T /\u03b8 boundary\nvalue problem tends to the over\u2013barrier classical solution,\nwith Tint extremized with respect to the initial oscillator\nphase.\nBecause Uint (~x) > 0, Tint is a positive quantity with\nat least one minimum. In normal situation there is only\none saddle point of F\u01eb , so by solving the T /\u03b8 boundary\nvalue problem one obtains the classical solution with the\ntime of interaction minimized.\nThe dependence of the interaction time on the initial\noscillator phase for given values of energy and excitation\nnumber is shown in Fig. 21. We see that Tint indeed\nhas one minimum, and the corresponding solution indeed\ncoincides with the limit of the solution of the regularized\nT /\u03b8 boundary value problem (black point on the graph).\n\n\f21\n\n9\n\n8\n\nTint(\u03c6i)\n\n6\n\n(Tint)0\n\u03c61\n\n5.2\n\n5.3\n\n\u03c60\n\n\u03c6i\n\n5.4\n\n\u03c62\n\n5.5\n\nFIG. 21: The dependence of the interaction time Tint on the\ninitial oscillator phase at fixed values of E and N , corresponding to the point (c) in Fig. 19.
