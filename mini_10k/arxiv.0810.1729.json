Compared to our previous formulation, the\nnew algorithm offers a reduction in memory requirements, the\nnumber of computational steps, and the number of messages\npassed. We prove that a detection method recently proposed by\nMontanari et al. is an instance of ours, and we provide new\nconvergence results applicable to both.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nBelief propagation (BP), also known as the sum-product\nalgorithm, is a powerful and efficient tool in solving, exactly\nor approximately, inference problems in probabilistic graphical\nmodels. The underlying essence of estimation theory is to\ndetect a hidden input to a channel from its observed output.\nThe channel can be represented as a certain graphical model,\nwhile the detection of the channel input is equivalent to\nperforming inference in the corresponding graph.\nThe use of BP [1] for detection purposes has been proven to\nbe very beneficial in several applications in communications.\nFor randomly-spread code-division multiple-access (CDMA)\nin the large-system limit, Kabashima has introduced a tractable\nBP-based multiuser detection (MUD) scheme, which exhibits\nnear-optimal error performance for binary-input additive white\nGaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channels [2]. This messagepassing scheme has recently been extended to the case where\nthe ambient noise level is unknown [3], [4]. As for sub-optimal\ndetection, the nonlinear soft parallel interference cancellation\n(PIC) detector was reformulated by Tanaka and Okada as an\napproximate BP solution [5] to the MUD problem.\nIn contrast to the dense, fully-connected nature of the\ngraphical model of the non-orthogonal CDMA channel, a onedimensional (1-D) intersymbol interference (ISI) channel can\nbe interpreted as a cycle-free tree graph [6]. Thus, detection\nin 1-D ISI channels (termed equalization) can be performed\nin an optimal maximum a-posteriori (MAP) manner via BP,\nalso known in this context as the forward/backward, or BCJR,\nalgorithm [7]. Also, Kurkoski et al. [8], [9] have proposed an\n1 Contributed equally to this work.\nSupported in part by NSF Grant No. CCR-0514859 and EVERGROW, IP\n1935 of the EU Sixth Framework.\n\niterative BP-like detection algorithm for 1-D ISI channels that\nuses a parallel message-passing schedule and achieves nearoptimal performance.\nFor the intermediate regime of non-dense graphs but\nwith many relatively short loops, extensions of BP to twodimensional ISI channels have been considered by Marrow\nand Wolf [10], and recently Shental et al. [11]\u2013[13] have\ndemonstrated the near-optimality of a generalized version\nof BP for such channels. Recently, BP has been proved\nto asymptotically achieve optimal MAP detection for sparse\nlinear systems with Gaussian noise [14], [15], for example, in\nCDMA with sparse spreading codes.\nAn important class of practical sub-optimal detectors is\nbased on linear detection. This class includes, for instance,\nthe conventional single-user matched filter (MF), decorrelator (a.k.a. zero-forcing equalizer), linear minimum meansquare error (MMSE) detector and many other detectors with\nwidespread applicability [16], [17]. In general, linear detection\ncan be viewed as the solution to a (deterministic) set of\nlinear equations describing the original (probabilistic) estimation problem. Note that the mathematical operation behind\nlinear detection extends to other tasks in communication, e.g. ,\nchannel precoding at the transmitter [18].\nRecently, linear detection has been explicitly linked to\nBP [19], using a Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) algorithm. This allows for a distributed implementation of the\nlinear detector [20], circumventing the need of, potentially\ncumbersome, direct matrix inversion (via, e.g. , Gaussian elimination). The derived iterative framework was compared quantitatively with 'classical' iterative methods for solving systems\nof linear equations, such as those investigated in the context\nof linear implementation of CDMA demodulation [21]\u2013[23].\nGaBP is shown to yield faster convergence than these standard\nmethods. Another important work is the BP-based MUD,\nrecently derived and analyzed by Montanari et al. [24] for\nGaussian input symbols.\nThere are several drawbacks to the linear detection technique of [19]. First, the input matrix Rn\u00d7n = STn\u00d7k Sk\u00d7n (the\nchip correlation matrix) needs to be computed prior to running\nthe algorithm. This computation requires n2 k operations. In\ncase where the matrix S is sparse [15], the matrix R might\n\n\fnot no longer be sparse. Second, GaBP uses 2n2 memory to\nstore the messages. For a large n this could be prohibitive.\nIn this paper, we propose a new construction that addresses\nthose two drawbacks. In our improved construction, given a\nnon-rectangular CDMA matrix Sn\u00d7k , we compute the MMSE\ndetector x = (ST S + \u03a8)\u22121 ST y where \u03a8 is the AWGN\ndiagonal covariance matrix. We utilize the GaBP algorithm\nwhich is an efficient iterative distributed algorithm. The new\nconstruction uses only 2nk memory for storing the messages.\nWhen k \u226a n this represents significant saving relative to the\n2n2 in our previously proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we do\nnot explicitly compute ST S, saving an extra n2 k overhead.\nWe show that Montanari's algorithm [24] is an instance of\nour method. By showing this, we are able to prove new convergence results for Montanari's algorithm. Montanari proves\nthat his method converges on normalized random-spreading\nCDMA sequences, assuming Gaussian signaling. Using binary\nsignaling, he conjectures convergence to the large system limit.\nHere, we extend Montanari's result, to show that his algorithm\nconverges also for non-random CDMA sequences when binary\nsignaling is used, under weaker conditions. Another advantage\nof our work is that we allow different noise levels per bit\ntransmitted.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II formulates the\nproblem of linear detection and presents the distributed GaBPbased linear detection scheme. Section III describes a novel\nconstruction for efficiently computing the MMSE detector.\nThe relation to a factor graph construction is explored in\nSection IV. New convergence results for Montanari's work\nare presented in Section V. We conclude in Section VI. In the\nAppendix we further explore the relation to Montanari's work.\nWe shall use the following notations. The operator {*}T\nstands for a vector or matrix transpose, the matrix IN is a\nN \u00d7N identity matrix, while the symbols {*}i and {*}ij denote\nentries of a vector and matrix, respectively. N(i) is the set of\ngraph node connected to node i.\nII. L INEAR D ETECTION VIA B ELIEF P ROPAGATION\nConsider a discrete-time channel with a real input vector x = {x1 , . . . , xK }T governed by an arbitrary prior\ndistribution, Px , and a corresponding real output vector\ny = {y1 , . . . , yK }T = f {xT } \u2208 RK . Here, the function f {*}\ndenotes the channel transformation. By definition, linear detection compels the decision rule to be\n\u2217\n\n\u22121\n\nx\u0302 = \u2206{x } = \u2206{A\n\nb},\n\n(1)\n\nwhere b = y is the K \u00d7 1 observation vector and the\nK \u00d7 K matrix A is a positive-definite symmetric matrix\napproximating the channel transformation. The vector x\u2217 is\nthe solution (over R) to Ax = b. Estimation is completed\nby adjusting the (inverse) matrix-vector product to the input\nalphabet, dictated by Px , accomplished by using a proper\nclipping function \u2206{*} (e.g. , for binary signaling \u2206{*} is the\nsign function).\nFor example, linear channels, which appear extensively in\nmany applications in communication and data storage systems,\n\nare characterized by the linear relation\ny = f {x} = Rx + n,\nwhere n is a K \u00d7 1 additive noise vector and R = ST S\nis a positive-definite symmetric matrix, often known as the\ncorrelation matrix. The N \u00d7K matrix S describes the physical\nchannel medium while the vector y corresponds to the output\nof a bank of filters matched to the physical channel S.\nAssuming linear channels with AWGN with variance \u03c3 2 as\nthe ambient noise, the general linear detection rule (1) can\ndescribe known linear detectors. For example [16], [17]:\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe conventional matched filter (MF) detector is obtained\nby taking A , IK and b = y. This detector is optimal,\nin the MAP-sense, for the case of zero cross-correlations,\ni.e. , R = IK , as happens for orthogonal CDMA or when\nthere is no ISI effect.\nThe decorrelator (zero forcing equalizer) is achieved by\nsubstituting A , R and b = y. It is optimal in the\nnoiseless case.\nThe linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detector\ncan also be described by using A = R + \u03c3 2 IK . This detector is known to be optimal when the input distribution\nPx is Gaussian.\n\nIn general, linear detection is suboptimal because of its\ndeterministic underlying mechanism (i.e. , solving a given set\nof linear equations), in contrast to other estimation schemes,\nsuch as MAP or maximum likelihood, that emerge from an\noptimization criterion.\nIn [19], linear detection, in its general form (1), was\nimplemented using an efficient message-passing algorithm.\nThe linear detection problem was shifted from an algebraic\nto a probabilistic domain. Instead of solving a deterministic\nvector-matrix linear equation, an inference problem is solved\nin a graphical model describing a certain Gaussian distribution\nfunction. Given the overall channel matrix R and the observation vector y, one knows how to write explicitly p(x) and\nthe corresponding graph G with edge potentials ('compatibility\nfunctions') \u03c8ij and self-potentials ('evidence') \u03c6i . These graph\npotentials are determined according to the following pairwise\nfactorization of the Gaussian distribution p(x)\np(x) \u221d\n\nK\nY\n\ni=1\n\n\u03c6i (xi )\n\nY\n\n\u03c8ij (xi , xj ),\n\n{i,j}\n\nresulting\nin\n\u03c8ij (xi , x\u0001j ) , exp(\u2212xi Rij xj )\nand\n\u03c6i (xi ) = exp bi xi \u2212 Rii x2i /2 . The set of edges {i, j}\ncorresponds to the set of all non-zero entries of A\nfor which i > j. Hence, we would like to calculate\nthe marginal densities, which must also be Gaussian,\np(xi ) \u223c N (\u03bci = {R\u22121 y}i , Pi\u22121 = {R\u22121 }ii ), where \u03bci\nand Pi are the marginal mean and inverse variance (a.k.a.\nprecision), respectively. It is shown that the inferred mean \u03bc\nis identical to the desired solution x\u2217 = R\u22121 y. Table I lists\nthe GaBP algorithm update rules.\n\n\fTABLE I\nC OMPUTING A\u22121 b VIA G A BP.

D ISTRIBUTED I TERATIVE C OMPUTATION OF\nMMSE D ETECTOR\n\nIn this section, we efficiently extend the applicability of the\nproposed GaBP-based solver for systems with symmetric matrices [19] to systems with any square (i.e. , also nonsymmetric) or rectangular matrix. We first construct a new symmetric\ndata matrix R\u0303 based on an arbitrary (non-rectangular) matrix\nS \u2208 Rk\u00d7n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIk ST\nR\u0303 ,\n\u2208 R(k+n)\u00d7(k+n) .\n(2)\nS \u2212\u03a8\nAdditionally, we define a new vector of variables x\u0303 ,\n{x\u0302T , zT }T \u2208 R(k+n)\u00d71 , where x\u0302 \u2208 Rk\u00d71 is the (to be shown)\nsolution vector and z \u2208 Rn\u00d71 is an auxiliary hidden vector,\nand a new observation vector \u1ef9 , {0T , yT }T \u2208 R(k+n)\u00d71 .\nNow, we would like to show that solving the symmetric\nlinear system R\u0303x\u0303 = \u1ef9 and taking the first k entries of the\ncorresponding solution vector x\u0303 is equivalent to solving the\noriginal (not necessarily symmetric) system Rx = y. Note\nthat in the new construction the matrix R\u0303 is sparse again, and\nhas only 2nk off-diagonal nonzero elements. When running\nthe GaBP algorithm we have only 2nk messages, instead of\nn2 in the previous construction.\nWriting explicitly the symmetric linear system's equations,\nwe get\nx\u0302 + ST z = 0,\nSx\u0302 \u2212 \u03a8z = y.\nThus,\nx\u0302 = \u03a8\n\n\u22121 T\n\nS (y \u2212 Sx\u0302),\n\nand extracting x\u0302 we have\nT\n\n\u22121 T\n\nx\u0302 = (S S + \u03a8)\n\nS y.\n\nNote, that when the noise level is zero, \u03a8 = 0m\u00d7m , we get\nthe Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse solution\nx\u0302 = (ST S)\u22121 ST y = S\u2020 y.\nIV. R ELATION TO\n\nFACTOR GRAPH\n\nIn this section we give an alternate proof of the correctness\nof our construction. Given the inverse covariance matrix R\u0303\ndefined in (2), and the shift vector x\u0303 we can derive the\nmatching self and edge potentials\n\u03c8ij (xi , xj ) , exp(\u2212xi Rij xj )\n\n2\n\u03c6i (xi ) , exp(\u22121/2xi Rii\nxi \u2212 xi yi )\n\nTHE\n\nwhich is a factorization of the Gaussian system distribution\nY\nY\n\u03c8ij (xi , xj ) =\n\u03c6i (xi )\np(x) \u221d\ni,j\n\ni\n\n=\n\nY\n\n\u03c6i (xi )\n\ni\u2264k\n\n=\n\nY\n\ni\u2264k\n\nY\n\ni>k\n\n\u03c6i (xi )\n\nY\n\n\u03c8ij (xi , xj ) =\n\ni,j\n\nprior on x\nRij\n}|\n{\nz}|{\nY\n1\n1 2 Y\nexp(\u2212xi Sij xj )\nexp(\u2212 \u03a8i x2i \u2212xi yi )\nexp(\u2212 xi )\n2\n2\ni,j\nz\n\ni>k\n\nNext, we show the relation of our construction to a factor\ngraph. We will use a factor graph with k nodes to the left (the\nbits transmitted) and n nodes to the right (the signal received),\nshown in Fig. 1. Using the definition x\u0303 , {x\u0302T , zT }T \u2208\nR(k+n)\u00d71 the vector x\u0302 represents the k input bits and the\nvector z represents the signal received. Now we can write the\nsystem probability as:\nZ\nN (x\u0302; 0, I)N (z; S x\u0302, \u03a8)dx\u0302\np(x\u0303) \u221d\nx\u0302\n\nIt is known that the marginal distribution over z is:\n= N (z; 0, ST S + \u03a8)\nThis distribution is Gaussian, with the following parameters:\nE(z|x\u0302) = (ST S + \u03a8)\u22121 ST y\nCov(z|x\u0302) = (ST S + \u03a8)\u22121\nIt is interesting to note that a similar construction was used\nby Frey [26] in his seminal 1999 work when discussing the\nfactor analysis learning problem. While his work is beyond\nthe scope of this paper, it can be shown that his algorithm can\nbe modelled using the GaBP algorithm.\nV. N EW\n\nCONVERGENCE RESULTS\n\nOne of the benefits of using our new construction is that\nwe propose a new mechanism to provide future convergence\nresults. In the Appendix we prove that Montanari's algorithm\nis an instance of our algorithm, thus our convergence results\napply to Montanari's algorithm as well.\nWe know that if the matrix R\u0303 is strictly diagonally dominant, then GaBP converges and the marginal means converge\n\n\fK bits sent\n\nn bits received\n\nCDMA channel linear transformation\n\nFig. 1.\n\nFactor graph describing the linear channel\n\nunlike his work which uses a single fixed noise for the whole\nsystem. In practice, the bits are transmitted using different\nfrequencies, thus suffering from different noise levels. Second,\nthe update rules in his paper are fitted only to the randomlspreading CDMA codes, where the matrix A contains only\nvalues which are drawn uniformly from {\u22121, 1}. Assuming\nbinary signalling, he conjectures convergence to the large\nsystem limit. Our new convergence proof holds for any CDMA\nmatrices provided that the absolute sum of the chip sequences\nis one, under weaker conditions on the noise level. Third,\nwe propose in [19] an efficient broadcast version for saving\nmessages in a broadcast supporting network.\nThe probability distribution of the factor graph used by\nMontanari is:\nd\u03bcN,K\n=\ny\n\nto the true means [27, Claim 4]. Noting that the matrix R\u0303 is\nsymmetric, we can determine the applicability of this condition\nby examining its columns. Referring to (4) we see that in\nthe first k columns, we have the k CDMA sequences. We\nassume random-spreading binary CDMA sequences which are\nnormalized\u221ato one. In other words, the absolute sum of each\ncolumn is n. In that case, the matrix R\u0303 is not diagonally\n\u221a\ndominant (DD). We can add a regularization term of n + \u01eb\nto force the matrix R\u0303 to be DD, but we pay in changing the\nproblem. In the next n columns of the matrix R\u0303, we have the\ndiagonal covariance matrix \u03a8 with different noise levels per bit\nin the main diagonal, and\n\u221a zero elsewhere. The absolute sum of\neach column of S is k/\n\u221a n, thus when the noise level of each\nbit satisfies \u03a8i > k/ n, we have a convergence guarantee.\nNote, that the convergence condition is a sufficient condition.\nBased on Montanari's work, we also know that in the large\nsystem limit, the algorithm converges for binary signaling,\neven in the absence of noise.\nAn area of future work is to utilize this observation to\nidentify CDMA schemes with matrices S that when fitted into\nthe matrix R\u0303 are either DD, or comply to the spectral radius\nconvergence condition of [28].\n\n1\nZyN,K\n\nN\nY\n\nK\nY\n1\n1\nexp(\u2212 x2i )\nexp(\u2212 \u03c3 2 \u03c9a2 + jya \u03c9a )\n2\n2\na=1\ni=1\n\n*\n\nY\ni,a\n\nj\nexp(\u2212 \u221a sai \u03c9a xi )d\u03c9\nN\n\nExtracting the self and edge potentials from the above\nprobability distribution:\n1\n\u03c8ii (xi ) , exp(\u2212 x2i ) \u221d N (x; 0, 1)\n2\n1\n\u03c8aa (\u03c9a ) , exp(\u2212 \u03c3 2 \u03c9a2 + jya \u03c9a ) \u221d N (\u03c9a ; jya , \u03c3 2 )\n2\nj\nj\n\u03c8ia (xi , \u03c9a ) , exp(\u2212 \u221a sai \u03c9a xi ) \u221d N (x; \u221a sai , 0)\nN\nN\nFor convenience, Table II provides a translation between the\nnotations used in this paper (taken from [19]) and that used\nby Montanari et al. in [24]:\nTABLE II\nS UMMARY OF NOTATIONS\nThis work [19]\nPij\n\nVI.
