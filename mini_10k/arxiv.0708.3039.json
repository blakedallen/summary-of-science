One intriguing only recently experimentally realized example [1, 2] is the Tonks-Girardeau gas [3],\nin which a one-dimensional (1D) system of strongly interacting bosons acquires fermionic properties. Already in 1960\nGirardeau found an elegant solution of these systems which\nmaps the wave functions of non-interacting spinless fermions\nto that of spinless hard-core bosons. However, a thorough\ndescription of quasi-1D bosons needs to include the spin degrees of freedom. Surprisingly, thus far no Fermi-Bose mapping for these important systems exists. In current investigations Girardeau's Fermi-Bose mapping has been extended to\nfermionic Tonks-Girardeau gases [4, 5, 6, 7] and very recently\nalso to mixtures [8] and two-level atoms [9]. Ferromagnetic\nbehavior in a strongly interacting two-component Bose gas\nhas been found in the thermodynamic limit [10].\nIn this Letter we present for the first time an analytically\nexact solution of quasi-1D bosons with infinite \u03b4-repulsion,\nwhich includes the spin degrees of freedom. This opens up\nnew possibilities for a precise manipulation and description\nof these fundamental systems. We show that the strongly\ninteracting spinor bosons behave like a compound of noninteracting spinless fermions and non-interacting distinguishable spins which is especially reflected in the spin densities\nand the energy spectrum. These properties are very different from those of weakly interacting spinor Bose gases [11].\nAnother key result is that in contrast to single-component systems the momentum distribution of the spinor bosons depends\non the symmetry of the spin function.\nModel.- The many-body Hamiltonian describing N quasi1D spin-1 bosons at zero magnetic field is given by the\n3N\u00d73N dimensional matrix [11]\n\u0015\nN \u0014\nX\n1\n~2 \u2202 2\n2 2\n+ m\u03c9 zi 11spin\n\u2212\nH =\n2m \u2202zi2\n2\ni=1\ni\nh\nX\n\u03b4(zi \u2212 zj ) U0 11spin + U2 f~i * f~j ,\n+\ni<j\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the bosons, \u03c9 is the axial trap frequency, 11spin is the identity matrix in spin space, U0 and U2\nare the coupling constants of the spin-independent and spindependent interactions, and f~i denote the dimensionless spin1 matrices of boson i. We consider a highly elongated trap\nwhere the transverse trap frequency \u03c9\u22a5 is much larger than the\naxial trap frequency (\u03c9\u22a5 \u226b \u03c9) so that the transverse motion\nis restricted to zero-point oscillations. In this limit the effective coupling constants are \u221a\ngiven by Ui = 2~\u03c9\u22a5 ci \u03b3 (i = 0, 2)\nwith \u03b3 = 1/(1 \u2212 1.46a0 / 2l\u22a5 ) [12], c0 = (a0 + 2a2 )/3,\nand c2 = (a2 \u2212 a0 )/3 [11], where\np a0 and a2 are the s-wave\n~/(m\u03c9\u22a5 ). We neglect pscattering lengths and l\u22a5 =\nwave scattering [6]. Thus, U0 and U2 are proportional to the\ntransverse trap frequency \u03c9\u22a5 which has been used in experiments [2] to reach the strong interaction limit. The Hamiltonian (1) conserves P\nparity\u0001 \u03a0, total magnetization Fz , and total spin F~ 2 F~ = i f~i . In the limit of infinite repulsion\n(U0 = \u221e) we use a Fermi-Bose map to construct the eigenfunctions of (1), whereas for large but finite repulsion we numerically diagonalize (1) via a finite basis set approach [13].\nExact eigenstates in the limit of infinite repulsion.- We\nfirst construct the exact eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (1)\nin the limit of infinite repulsion (U0 = \u221e). In this limit one\ncan neglect the spin-dependent interaction and we set U2 = 0.\nFor simplicity we restrict our discussion to the ground\nstates of spin-1 bosons. Because of the infinite \u03b4-repulsion\nthe configuration space RN decomposes into N ! sectors\nC\u03c0 = {(z1 , . . . , zN ) \u2208 RN , z\u03c0(1) < * * * < z\u03c0(N ) }, where \u03c0\nis an arbitrary permutation. At the boundaries of these sectors the wave function has to be zero [\u03c8(z1 , . . . , zN ) = 0 if\nzi = zj ] and within these sectors the wave function has to\nobey the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of non-interacting particles.\nLet us disregard the spin of the wave function in a first step.\nThe Fermi ground state \u03c80F of the problem above is given by\nthe ground state Slater determinant of non-interacting spinless fermions. The ground state of spinless bosons \u03c80B is\ngiven by the absolute value of the Fermi ground state [3]:\n\u03c80B = \u03c80F . There is no symmetry restriction to the wave\nfunction of distinguishable particles. Thus, any restriction of\n\n\f2\n\nNow we take the spin into account. The product of an arbitrary orbital function |\u03c0i with an arbitrary N -particle spin\nfunction |\u03c7i is an eigenfunction of Hamiltonian (1), since H is\ndiagonal in spin space (we have neglected U2 ). Thus, the wave\nfunction |\u03c0i|\u03c7i describes distinguishable hard-core particles\nwith spin. In order to describe bosons one has to symmetrize\nthis non-symmetric wave function. One can directly construct\nall bosonic solutions from the spin functions by means of the\nunitary map\n\u221a\n(3)\nW |\u03c7i = N !PS (|idi|\u03c7i) ,\nP\nwhere PS = N1 ! \u03c0\u01ebSN U (\u03c0) denotes the symmetric projection operator and id is the identical permutation. The action\nof the permutation operators U (\u03c0) onto the spinor wave functions is given by\nU (\u03c0)|\u03c0 \u2032 i|f1 , . . . , fN i = |\u03c0\u03c0 \u2032 i|f\u03c0\u22121 (1) , . . . , f\u03c0\u22121 (N ) i,\nwhere \u03c0\u03c0 \u2032 is the composition of the permutations \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2032 ,\nand fi = \u00b11, 0 are the spin indices of the ith particle. Equation (3), as the main result of our Letter, provides an analytical and general extension of Girardeau's Fermi-Bose mapping to bosons with spin degrees of freedom. The map W\nis isometric, and therefore, an orthonormal set of spin functions is directly mapped onto an orthonormal set of bosonic\nground states. It is also bijective, and thus the degeneracy of\nthe ground state equals the dimension of the N -particle spin\nspace. Further, we can directly construct bosonic Fz and F~ 2\neigenfunctions W |\u03c7i, since Fz and F~ 2 commute with PS .\nThe above construction scheme can be extended to the excited states and to bosons with arbitrary spin. To obtain the excited states one has to replace \u03c80F in Eq. (2) by A\u03c8iF , where\n\u03c8iF is the ith eigenfunction of the non-interacting fermionic\nproblem and A is the \"unit antisymmetric function\" [3]. It\nfollows immediately that the energy eigenvalues of the spin-1\nbosons at zero magnetic field agree with the energies of spinless non-interacting fermions; i.e., the ground state energy is\ngiven by Eg = N 2 /2 ~\u03c9 and the level spacing is \u2206E = 1 ~\u03c9.\nHowever, the degeneracy of each energy level is 3N times\nlarger than in the spinless case. A homogeneous magnetic\nfield lifts the degeneracy of the levels and shifts the energy of\neach Fz eigenstate W |f1 , . . . , fN i according to the Zeeman\nenergy of the spin function |f1 , . . . , fN i.\nLarge finite repulsion.- In the following we analyze the\nstructure of the ground state multiplet in the regime of large\nbut finite repulsion. The results are based on a numerical diagonalization of (1).

Restrictions to different\nsectors are orthogonal. Thus, the ground state of N spinless\ndistinguishable particles is N ! times degenerate. An orthonormal basis of the space of ground states is therefore given by\n(\u221a\nN ! \u03c80F if z\u03c0(1) < * * * < z\u03c0(N )\nhz1 , . . . , zN |\u03c0i =\n(2)\n0 otherwise.\n\n\u22120.1\n\n|1, 0,\u22121i\n\n0\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.1\n\n|\u22121, 1, 0i\n\n|\u22121, 0, 1i\n\u22124\n\n0\n0\n\nz1 [l]\n\n4\n\n\u22124\n\n0\n\n4\n\nz1 [l]\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Cut through the non-zero spin-components\nof a bosonic 3-particle state (see text). The second and the third\ncoordinate are fixed at z2 = \u22120.8 l and z3 = 0.8 l. Shown is the\nexact wave function in the limit of infinite \u03b4-repulsion (red solid line)\nand the solution of a numerical diagonalizion of (1) in the limit of\nlarge but finite repulsion (blue dashed line).\n\nthe ground state is 3N times degenerate. For realistic systems the spin-independent interaction U0 is large and finite\nand the spin-dependent interaction U2 is much smaller so that\nthe ground state energy level is quasidegenerate. Let us first\nconsider the case that U2 is zero. Then, states with completely\nsymmetric spin functions have lowest energy [14] whereas\nstates with most antisymmetric spin functions have highest\nenergy. The energy gap \u2206E0 , which arises from the symmetry of the spin function (which is closely related to the\nsymmetry of the \u0002corresponding orbital functions), is proporei = Ui /(~\u03c9l) are dimensionless interace0 U\ntional to ~\u03c9/U\np\n\u0003\ntion strengths and l = ~/(m\u03c9 . A similar energy structure\nhas been discussed in Ref. [8] for a two-component system.\nLet us now switch on U2 . Then, all states become F~ 2 eigenstates and the states with completely symmetric spin functions\nhave total spin F = N , N \u2212 2, N \u2212 4, ... [14]. For ferromagnetic coupling, U2 < 0, states with F = N have lowest energy whereas for antiferromagnetic coupling, U2 > 0,\nstates with F = 1 (if N is odd) or F = 0 (if N is even) become ground states.

As an\nexample, Fig. 1 shows the 3-boson state |\u03c8i = W |\u03c7i with\n|\u03c7i = 1/2(|0, 1, \u22121i + |0, \u22121, 1i \u2212 |1, \u22121, 0i \u2212 | \u2212 1, 1, 0i)\n(red solid line), which is a Fz , F~ 2 , and parity eigenstate\n(Fz = 0, F = 1, \u03a0 = \u22121), compared to the corresponding\n\n\f3\n\ni\n\nf1 ,...,fN\n\n\u00d7|\u03c8f1 ,...,fN (z1 , . . . , zN )|2\n\nresembles the one of a chain of localized, distinguishable\nspins.

By interpreting the square root of the densities \u03c1(i) (gray dash-dotted line\nin Figs. 2a and\npb) as the wave packet of an imaginary particle, \u03c8 (i) := \u03c1(i) , we obtain the intuitive picture of distinguishable localized particles which are arranged in a row\nalong the z-axis, one after the other [2, 17].

The spin\ndensities resemble the one of a chain of localized spins.\n\nhas a certain spin orientation fi according to the spin state\n|\u03c7i = |f1 , f2 , . . .i. The spin density of the bosonic system\nnow corresponds to the spin density of this row of distinguishable particles with the spin orientations given by |\u03c7i.\nFig. 2a shows the spin density of the spin-polarized state\nW |\u03c7+ i = W |1, 1, . . .i. In the spin-polarized case all the\nprobabilities pi (1) = 1 and Eq. (4) reduces to: \u03c11 =\nP\n(i)\n= \u03c1Fermi . Fig. 2b shows the spin density of the\ni\u03c1\nground state W |1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1i. Similarly one has to add\nthe particle densities \u03c1(1) \u2212 \u03c1(3) and \u03c1(8) to the component\n\u03c11 , and the particle densities \u03c1(4) \u2212 \u03c1(7) to the component\n\u03c10 of the spin density.

For comparison we have\nalso plotted the momentum distribution of 5 non-interacting\nfermions (gray dashed line). It turns out that the shape of\nthe momentum distribution depends on the symmetry of the\nspin function so that different ground states can have completely different momentum distributions. States with a completely symmetric spin function have a completely symmetric orbital function, W |\u03c7s i = \u03c80F |\u03c7s i, which is given by\n\n\f4\n\n\u03c1(p) [l/h\u0304]\n\n3\n\n\"almost antisymmetric\"\nspin states\n\nspinless TG gas\nspinless fermions\n\nnon-symmetric\n2 spin states\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nthe symmetry of the spin functions.

For large but finite repulsion we have discussed the level structure of the ground state\nmultiplet. Due to the similarity with distinguishable spins the\nspinor Tonks-Girardeau gas might be a promising candidate\nfor novel quantum computation schemes.\nAcknowledgments.- We thank K.

The gray dashed line shows for comparison\nthe momentum distribution of 5 non-interacting fermions. The shape\nof the momentum distribution depends on the symmetry of the spin\nfunction.\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n\nthe usual Tonks-Girardeau wave function. The momentum\ndistribution of these states is equal to the one of a spinless\nTonks-Girardeau gas (blue dash-dotted line) which exhibits\na pronounced zero-momentum peak and long-range, highmomentum tails [13, 18]. The other extreme case is given\nby a flat and broad momentum distribution which resembles\nthe fermionic one (red solid line). In the case of 2 and 3 spin-1\nbosons some spin functions |\u03c7a i can be completely antisymmetric and thus the corresponding ground state is given by\nW |\u03c7a i = \u03c80F |\u03c7a i so that its momentum distribution is equal\nto the one of spinless fermions. One cannot construct completely antisymmetric spin functions with more than 3 spin-1\nparticles. However, it is possible to construct non-symmetric\nspin functions which are \"almost antisymmetric\" (see Young's\nTableaux [19]) resulting in momentum distributions which are\nalmost fermionic. We believe, due to group theoretical arguments [19], that this broadening and flattening of some momentum distributions saturates for large N .\nPreparation and manipulation of the states.- Spin polarized Tonks-Girardeau gases have been prepared with ultracold\n87\nRb atoms in optical lattices [1, 2]. To prepare states with\nnon-symmetric spin functions we suggest to apply a radio frequency together with a magnetic field gradient so that the spin\nof each atom is rotated into a different final state depending\non its position.\nSummary.- We have constructed the exact eigenstates of\nthe fundamental system of quasi-1D spin-1 bosons with infinite \u03b4-repulsion by means of a Fermi-Bose map. The construction scheme and the formula for the spin densities are\nvalid independent of the particle number, the spin of the\nbosons, and the (spin-independent) trapping potential. From\nthe exact solutions we have determined the energy spectrum\nand the spin densities of the ground states. The momentum\ndistribution of the eigenstates turned out to be dependent on\n\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\n[17]\n\n[18]\n\n[19]\n\nElectronic address: fdeuretz@physnet.uni-hamburg.de\nElectronic address: klaus.fredenhagen@desy.de\nB.
