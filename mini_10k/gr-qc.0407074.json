Despite of tremendous efforts made, unfortunately we still\ndo not have a fully satisfactory theory of quantum gravity. In the last couple of decades two strong contenders\nhave emerged: the string theory approach [1] and the\nloop quantum gravity (LQG) approach [2]. The issue of\nfate of classical cosmological singularities has been addressed head-on within the LQG approach. More precisely, the adaptation of LQG methods to cosmological\ncontext, known as loop quantum cosmology (LQC) [3],\nhas made impressive progress on the issue of singularities. It has been shown that the isotropic models (flat\nand closed)[4], and more generally the diagonal Bianchi\nclass A models [5, 6], are free of singularity. It is time\nnow to explore further consequences of LQC corrected\ncosmologies.\nSome of consequences of LQC corrected cosmologies\nhave already been noted. First, there is a natural mechanism for inflation [7, 8, 9] within the context of isotropic\nmodels. Secondly, for the Bianchi IX model there is\na suppression of chaotic approach to singularity [10].\nThirdly, there is indication of a bounce at the big crunch\nsingularity as well [11, 12]. All of these have been explored within the framework of an effective Hamiltonian\nwhich incorporates the most significant non-perturbative\ncorrections. These modifications stem from the nontrivial definition of the inverse triad operator in LQC\n[6, 13] which ensure that the matter density, spin connection components remain bounded as universe approaches\nzero volume.\nThe effective Hamiltonian is derived from the admissibility of a continuum approximation [14]. This comes\nabout as a requirement on the LQC quantization of the\nHamiltonian constraint operator which always leads to a\ndifference equation for the quantum wave function. For\nlarge volumes, these wave functions are expected to vary\nslowly since quantum effects are small. This feature allows one to use an interpolating wave function of a con-\n\ntinuous variable which satisfies a differential equation,\nthe 'Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation'. Making a further WKB\napproximation leads one to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation\nfrom which the effective Hamiltonian is read-off. This is\nextrapolated to smaller (but not too small) volumes by\nreplacing the occurrence of inverse triad/volume factors\nby a function coming from the definition of the inverse\ntriad operator. The validity of the effective Hamiltonian\nis limited by the validity of WKB approximation and the\nvalidity of the continuum approximation.\nRecently, we have extended the domain of validity\nof the continuum approximation by exploiting the nonseparable structure of the Kinematical Hilbert space of\nLQC [15] which has infinitely many solutions of the fundamental difference equation. Although each of these\nmay not be slowly varying at smaller volumes, one can\nchoose linear combinations to construct solutions which\nare slowly varying almost every where. This amounts\nto an ad-hoc restriction to a sub-class of solution. In\nthe absence of any other criteria to limit the infinity of\nsolutions, such as a physical inner product, this restriction is treated as exploratory. The extraction of effective Hamiltonian then follows the same method as before\nvia a WKB approximation. The validity of the effective\nHamiltonian is now limited only by the validity of WKB\napproximation i.e. to 'classically accessible regions'. The\neffective Hamiltonian is derived in [16] and is given by,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nA(p)\n1 B+ (p) 2\neff\nK +\u03b7\n+ Wqg + Hm (1)\nH =\u2212\n\u03ba\n4p0\n2p0\nwhere \u03ba = 16\u03c0G, p0 = 61 \u03b3l2P \u03bc0 , K is the extrinsic curva3\n3\nture (conjugate variable of p), A(p) = |p+p0 | 2 \u2212|p\u2212p0 | 2 ,\n\u03b7 takes values 0, 1 for spatially flat, closed models respectively, B\u0010+ (p) =\u0011A(p + 4p0 ) + A(p \u2212 4p0 ), l2P := \u03ba~\nl4\n\nP\nand Wqg = 288\u03bap\n{B+ (p) \u2212 2A(p)}. Apart from the\n3\n0\nmodification of the coefficients of the gravitational kinetic term and the spatial curvature term, the effective\nHamiltonian(1) differs from the classical Hamiltonian by\na non-trivial potential term referred to as quantum geometry potential and denoted as Wqg . It is odd under\nthe reversal of orientation of the triad (p \u2192 \u2212p) and for\n\n\f2\np > 0, it is negative definite. The origin of this potential\nterm is necessarily quantum gravitational as it explicitly involves lP . For large volume this potential falls-off\nas p\u22123/2 while for small volume it vanishes as p. These\nsmall/large volume regions are delineated by the scale p0 .\nFor simplicity we consider a matter sector consisting\nof a single scalar field. Its classical Hamiltonian is LQC\ncorrected in the usual manner [7, 17]. It is shown in [9]\nthat for small volume (p \u226a 2jp0 ), with non-perturbative\ncorrections, the scalar field effectively behaves like an inflaton field since the effective equation of state variable,\n\u03c9 eff \u2192 \u22121 (or \u2212 34 if the triad variable p can get smaller\nthan p0 ). The matter Hamiltonian is related to the mat4\nter effective density [9, 16] as Hm = 3p80 Ba+ \u03c1eff and the\nconservation equation implies that for a constant \u03c9 eff ,\neff\nthe effective density goes as \u223c a\u22123(1+\u03c9 ) . One can see\nthat in either case of inflationary or super-inflationary\nregimes, the matter Hamiltonian always goes as \u223c p3/2 .\nGiven the behaviors of the quantum geometry potential and the matter Hamiltonian during a (super) inflationary region and their opposite signs, it is clear that the\nquantum geometry potential will always dominate the\nmatter Hamiltonian implying imaginary value for the extrinsic curvature i.e. existence of classically in-accessible\nscale factors. The two necessarily cancel each other at\na finite, non-zero value of the scale factor. This would\nbe so even after including the contribution of the spatial\ncurvature (\u03b7). But this means that the extrinsic curvature vanishes at that value of the scale factor implying\na bounce. Thus we see that a bounce is quite generic\nand the minimum scale factor defines a new length scale\nLbounce . Below this scale, the effective classical picture\nfails. A graphical illustration of the existence of bounce\ncan be seen in the figure (1).\nThe bounce scale is obviously determined by the conditions H eff = 0 = K with Hm = hp3/2 , h being a constant\nof proportionality. This is a transcendental equation in p\nand the root(s) depend on the constant h. We expect the\nbounce value to be less than 2jp0 (above which we are in\nthe classical regime). In geometrized units, \u03ba = 1 = c, we\n\u221a\nwill refer to all lengths to the scale p0 . Thus, putting\np := qp0 the region of interest is 0 \u226a q \u226a 2j. This\ncould be further divided into (i) 0 \u226a q \u226a 1 and (ii)\n1 \u226a q \u226a 2j. Since the equation of state variable is a\ndimensionless function of the scale factor, it is in fact a\nfunction of q. The conservation\nR q equation can then be\nsolved as: \u03c1eff (q) = \u03c1\u0304 exp{\u2212 23 2j (1 + \u03c9 eff (q)) dq\nq }. The\nconstant h is proportional to \u03c1\u0304 = \u03c1eff (2j). In summary,\nthe equations determining the (non-zero) bounce scale,\nqbounce , are,\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ q\np3\n(2)\nHm (q) = 6 0 q 2 \u03c1\u0304 exp \u2212 23\n(1 + \u03c9 eff (q)) dq\nq\nB+\n2j\nk\n\n12\n\nWqg + Hm\nWqg\nHm\n\n9\n6\n3\n0\n-3\n-6\n0\n\n2\n4\n6\n8\nDensitized triad p in units of p0 ----->\n\n10\n\nFIG. 1: For the small volume with non-perturbative corrections, the scalar matter Hamiltonian along a trajectory\n3\nis given by Hm \u2248 hp 2 . Thus non-perturbatively corrected\nscalar matter Hamiltonian vanishes at p = 0. If there were\nno quantum geometry potential term, Wqg , in the effective\nHamiltonian then for the spatially flat case (\u03b7 = 0) p = 0\npoint would have been accessible through the evolution. Although being a non-singular evolution it would have taken infinite coordinate time to reach p = 0 nevertheless there would\nhave been no minimum proper length for the given spacetime. But once we incorporate the effect of quantum geometry potential Wqg then we can see that the combined effect\nof Hm and Wqg will lead the extrinsic curvature to become\nzero at a non-zero value of p. Since for small p, Wqg \u223c \u2212p\n3\nand Hm \u223c p 2 then there will always be a region where Wqg\ndominates over Hm . Naturally there will always exist a classically inaccessible region leading to a generic Big Bounce.

Also the bounce scale\nwill be smaller than the Planck scale. This is indicative of the effective continuum model becoming a poor\napproximation.\nIn region (ii), h = \u03c1\u0304.

Region (ii) bounce\nscale has no explicit dependence on the ambiguity parameter j, the implicit dependence being subsumed in\nthe value of \u03c1\u0304 which can be treated as a free parameter.\nThe bounce scale is larger than the Planck scale and the\ndensity \u03c1\u0304 is smaller than the Planck density. The relation\nbetween h and the bounce scale is displayed in figure (2).\n\npicture cannot be trusted. The quantum geometry potential plays a crucial role in this result.\nA remark about the physical justification for the approximations used is in order. The results use the effective Hamiltonian picture which is based on a continuum approximation followed by the WKB approximation. The physical justification thus hinges on the\nphysical justification for these two approximations. The\ncontinuum approximation for the geometry is physically\nexpected to be a good approximation for length scales\nlarger than the discreteness scale set by 4p0 \u221d 4\u03bc0 , the\nstep size in the fundamental difference equation. The\nWKB approximation is valid in a sub-domain of the continuum approximation, determined by slow variation of\namplitude and phase. Mathematically, the amplitude\nvariation begins to get stronger around 2p0 [16] while the\nphase variation is stronger at the turning point which determines the bounce scale. Thus, physically, the effective\nHamiltonian (including the quantum geometry potential)\nis trustworthy for the bounce scale larger than \u223c p0 . As\nshown by the figure 2, there is a range of \u03c1\u0304 < lp\u22122 such\nthat the bounce scale is consistent with the physical domain of validity of the effective Hamiltonian.

It also vanishes as \u03c1\u0304 \u2192 \u221e. However in\nthe non-singular evolution implied by isotropic LQC (inverse scale factor having a bounded spectrum) implies\nthat there is a maximum energy density attainable and\nthe density \u03c1\u0304 can be thought of as this maximum energy\ndensity. Correspondingly there is a minimum scale factor or minimum proper volume since in LQC the fiducial\ncoordinate volume is absorbed in the definition of the\ntriad. For volumes smaller than the minimum volume,\nthe WKB approximation fails and the effective classical\n\nthat the behavior of the matter Hamiltonian as p 2 is dependent on p \u226a 2jp0 and hence the bounce scale is also\nsmaller than 2jp0 .\nWe will discuss now a possible implication of the minimum proper length on the inflationary cosmology. The\nstandard inflationary scenario is considered a successful paradigm not only because it can effectively solve\nthe traditional problems of standard classical cosmology, but also because it provides a natural mechanism\nof generating classical seed perturbations from quantum\nfluctuations. These seed perturbations are essential in\na theory of large scale structure formation but there\nis no mechanism of generating the initial perturbation\nwithin the classical setup. A quantum field living on\nan inflating background quite generically produces scaleinvariant power spectrum of primordial density perturbations which is consistent with the current observations.\nHowever, one major problem that plagues almost all\npotential driven inflationary models is that these models generically predict too much amplitude for density\nperturbation [18, 19]. Considering the fluctuations of\nquantum scalar field on an inflating classical background,\none can show that these models naturally predict density\n2\nperturbations at horizon re-entry to be \u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c1 \u223c 1 \u2212 10 .\n\u22125\nBut CMB anisotropy measurements indicates \u03b4\u03c1\n.\n\u03c1 \u223c 10\nThus it is very difficult to get desired amplitude for density perturbation from the standard inflationary scenarios unless one introduces some fine tuning in inflaton potential [20].\nAn interesting suggestion to get an acceptable amount\nof density perturbation from inflationary scenario was\nmade by Padmanabhan [21, 22]. The basic idea of the\n\n\f4\nsuggestion is that any proper theory of quantum gravity should incorporate a zero-point proper length. This\nin turns damps the propagation of modes with proper\nwavelength smaller than the zero-point proper length.\nThis mechanism reduces the amplitude of density perturbation by an exponential damping factor. The computations of [22] show that with the energy density (V0 )\nattainable during inflation to be order of the Planck energy density and the introduced cutoff (L) of the order\nof (G~/c3 )1/2 , one can indeed get the necessary amount\nof damping. In the picture discussed above, we already\nhave a correlation between \u03c1\u0304 and the bounce scale.\nAs discussed above, the effective model derived from\nsemi-classical LQC already shows the existence of a minimum proper length which can play the role of the zeropoint length. Furthermore, this scale is not put in by\nhand but arises generically and naturally from the nonsingularity of the effective model [16] and is correlated\nself-consistently with the maximum attainable energy\ndensity whose existence is also guaranteed in a nonsingular evolution. It has no explicit dependence on the\nquantization ambiguity parameter j. With the genericness of (exponential) inflation shown in [9] one can expects that the effective LQC model has the potential to\nproduce an acceptable primordial power spectrum as well\nas an acceptable amplitude for density perturbation. A\ndetailed analysis of primordial density fluctuations incorporating semi-classical LQC modifications is being carried out and will be reported elsewhere [23].\nApart from the possible phenomenological implications\nof the existence of a bounce, there are some theoretical implications as well. Within the WKB approximation used in deriving the effective Hamiltonian, existence of bounce corresponds to existence of classically\nin-accessible regions (volumes). This can also be interpreted as limiting the domain of validity of continuum\ngeometry or the kinematical framework of general relativity. Since the exact quantum wave functions do connect the two regions of the triad variable, there is also\nthe possibility of tunneling to and from the oppositely\noriented universe (p < 0) through these regions. Because of this, the bounce can be expected to be 'fuzzy'.\nIf and how the tunneling possibility between oppositely\noriented universe affects 'discrete symmetries' needs to\nbe explored.\nFinally, the bounce result has been derived using genericness of inflationary regime (p \u226a 2jp0 ). It is reasonable\nto assume that the maximum energy density would be\ncomparable or less than the Planck density. In such a case\nthe bounce scale will be greater than p0 . Thus, both the\nresults regarding genericness of bounce and genericness\nof inflation would follow even if the underlying assumption of slowly varying wave functions is valid only down\nto the bounce scale.\nWe are grateful to Martin Bojowald for helpful comments.\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n\nElectronic address: shyam@imsc.res.in\nElectronic address: golam@imsc.res.in\nGreen, M.
