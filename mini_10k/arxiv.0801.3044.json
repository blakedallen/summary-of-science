They have been intensively studied during the last several decades not only from an academic point of view, but also due to their\napplications in many man-made systems. An emerging line of research in which synchronization\nprocesses plays a key role is that of wireless communication networks. Synchronization processes in wireless systems naturally arise when routing and information flow algorithms establish\na universal coordinated time, thus requiring the synchronization of the clocks of the nodes of the\nwireless network. Additionally, due to the finiteness of communication channels, the access times\nof different users should be desynchronized when their number is large, which on its turn, is a\nfunction of the number of wireless devices accessing the available resources, i.e, of the topology\nof the underlying graph.\nThe description of the topological properties of wireless ad-hoc systems is not easy as they, unlike wired networks, are created on the fly to perform a task, such as information routing, environmental sensing, etc [Hekmat, 2006] Furthermore, the topology of these networks can be changed\ndynamically to achieve a desired functionality. With the rapid growth of the number of portable\ndevices and the increased popularity of wireless communication, it is expected that these types of\nnetworks will play a key role as a building block of the next generation Internet. On the other\nhand, from the perspective of fundamental research, these systems provide a clear-cut example of\nhighly dynamic, self-organizing complex networks. It is therefore natural to ask how networks\nthat topologically resemble the features of wireless settings compare with other architectures as\nfar as synchronization processes on top of them concern.\nThe entangled structural and dynamical complexity of synchronization phenomena in wireless\nnetworks makes the problem difficult to tackle in fine details. Approximations that shed light on\nthe general dynamical behavior of similar systems are thus called for. In this paper, we study the\nsynchronization of Kuramoto oscillators on random geometric graphs (RGGs), the latter being a\nplausible representation of the architecture of the system when the time scale associated to the\ndynamics is much faster than that associated to changes in the underlying topology. We address\nthe problem by considering the limiting situations of the onset of synchronization and the stability\nof the fully synchronized state. Our results show that Kuramoto oscillators achieve complete\n\n2\n\n\fsynchronization at very large coupling values as compared to their random graph counterparts.\nMoreover, we also show that the fully synchronized state is less stable in RGGs than in random\nand scale-free networks with the same number of nodes and average connectivity. Finally, we\npropose a mechanism by which the synchronization properties of RGGs can be greatly improved\nat low costs.\n\nII.\n\nNETWORK MODEL AND DYNAMICS\n\nIn what follows, we are interested in exploring the dynamical behavior at both the onset and the\nfully synchronized behavior. The first part of the phase diagram can only be explored by invoking\na specific dynamics, while the stability of the fully synchronized state can be generically studied\nfor a wide class of dynamical systems. The latter is achieved by exploring the spectral properties\nof the Laplacian matrix that completely describe the topology of the system under study. Using\nrecent results of the Master Stability Function formalism [Barahona & Pecora, 2002; Nishikawa\net al., 2003; Motter et al., 2005; Donetti et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2006; Chavez et al., 2005], one\nis able to reduce the problem of inspecting the stability of the completely synchronized state to an\neigenvalue problem where only the topological properties of the substrate graph are relevant.\nLet us then start by exploring the onset of synchronization. To this end, we consider that the\nN nodes of the RGG are oscillators whose dynamics are described by the Kuramoto model (KM).\nThe KM [Kuramoto, 1984; Acebr\u00f3n et al., 2005] is a model of phase oscillators coupled through\nthe sine of their phase differences. This model owes most of its success to the plenty of analytical\ninsights that one can get through the mean-field approximation originally proposed by Kuramoto\nin which nodes are globally coupled, i.e., according to an all-to-all topology. The model has also\nbeen recently used to study the synchronization of phase oscillators in complex networks [Moreno\n& Pacheco, 2004; Oh et al., 2005; McGraw & Menzinger, 2005; Arenas et al., 2006; G\u00f3mezGarde\u00f1es et al., 2007a; G\u00f3mez-Garde\u00f1es et al., 2007b]. In the KM formalism, the phase of the\ni-th unit, denoted by \u03b8i (t), evolves in time according to\nX\nd\u03b8i\n= \u03c9i + \u03bb\nAij sin(\u03b8j \u2212 \u03b8i )\ndt\nj\n\ni = 1, ..., N\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c9i stands for its natural frequency, \u03bb is the coupling strength between units and Aij is the\nconnectivity matrix (Aij = 1 if i is linked to j and 0 otherwise). The model can be solved in terms\nof an order parameter r that measures the extent of synchronization in a system of N oscillators\n3\n\n\fas:\ni\u03a8\n\nre\n\nN\n1 X i\u03b8j\n=\ne\nN j=1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a8 represents the average phase of the system. The parameter r takes values 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1,\nbeing r = 0 the value of the incoherent solution and r = 1 the value for total synchronization.\nThe topological properties of the wireless system contained in the matrix Aij is modeled by\nconsidering that the connections among the nodes of the network vary at a time scale much\nslower than the time scale associated to the dynamics. Therefore, one can consider the underlying graph as static. In order to generate the network, we consider a set of nodes distributed in a\ntwo-dimensional plane. To each of these nodes, a maximum transmission range is assigned, such\nthat a node is linked to only those nodes within a circle of radius equal to the maximum transmission range [Nekovee, 2007]. Repeating this procedure for all nodes in the network, the topology\nof the resulting network can be described as a two-dimensional random geometric graph [Dall &\nChristensen, 2002; Penrose, 2003]. Random geometric graphs have been used before in the study\nof continuum percolation and have been revitalized recently in the context of wireless ad hoc networks [Glauche et al., 2004; Krause et al., 2006]. They have a distribution of connectivity, P (k),\nthat like Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9ny random graphs (ER) [Dorogovtsev & Mendes, 2003; Bornholdt & Schuster,\n2003; Boccaletti et al., 2006], is peaked at an average value hki with a finite variance.\nOn the other hand, other topological characteristics of the RGGs are very far from typical\nrandom networks, namely their clustering coefficent hCi and the average path length hLi. The\nclustering coefficient is defined as the probability that two neighbors of a given node are also connected betweem them, whereas the average path lenght accounts for the average distance between\nevery pair of nodes in the network, being the distance between two neighbors set to 1. As introduced before, a RGG is constructed in a physical space and hence when two nodes are physically\nclose to a third one (and hence both share a link with it), the probability that they are also physically close is high. Therefore the value of the the clustering coefficent is much higher than the\ntypical values found in random ER networks with the same number of nodes, N, and links, Nl .\nFurthermore, the absence of links between physically separated nodes prevents the existence of\nshortcuts in the network and hence RGGs have a much larger average path length than the ER\ngraphs with the same N and Nl .\nTo unravel how the above topological features of RGGs affect the synchronization of phase\noscillators we have constructed a family of networks whose structural characteristics are varied\n\n4\n\n\f1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-4\n10\n\n<L>(p)/LRGG\n<C>(p)/CRGG\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\np\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nFIG. 1: Average clustering coefficent hCi and average path length hLi of the rewired RGG network as a\nfunction of the fraction of rewired links p. Both quantities are normalized to the corresponding values of\nthe original RGG network (CRGG = 0.61 and LRGG = 11.55).\n\nfrom those of RGG to those found in random graphs such as ER networks. For this purpose a\nrewiring process is performed on the RGGs. The rewiring is made as follows: we consider one\npair of connected nodes (i,j) and with probability 0 < p < 1 we remove the link and add a new\none from one of the nodes i or j (we choose one with equal probability) to a new node randomly\nchosen from the N \u2212 2 remaining nodes of the network. This process is repeated for all the links\npresent in the original graph. For each value of p we generate a sample of rewired networks over\nwhich averages are performed. In this way, we have new networks with a fraction p of links\ndifferent from those of the original RGG. Besides, we only consider those resulting networks that\nafter the rewiring process have one single connected component.\nThe rewiring process is aimed to gradually (as p varies from 0 to 1) destroy the correlations\nbetween nodes present in the RGG so that in the limit p = 1 we obtain ER networks. We have\nconstructed ensembles of 103 rewired networks for different values of p and computed the average\nclustering coefficient and average path lenght in these ensembles. In Figure 1 we plot both quantities as a function of the rewiring parameter, hCi(p) and hLi(p), normalized to the corresponding\nvalues found in the RGG. The result obtained is a small-world transition as p grows from 0 to 1:\nwhile the average path length decreases very fast with the rewiring of a few links (this rewiring\ncreates shortcuts), the clustering coefficent hCi(p) shows a slower decrease and remain roughly\nthe same as in the RGG until p \u2243 10\u22122. Notice, however, that given the large value of hCi for the\nRGG, even for larger values of p, the clustering coefficient is very high.\n5\n\n\fr\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\nRGG\nRewired p=10-2\nRewired p=10-1\nRewired p=1.0\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03bb\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Order parameter r as a function of the coupling strength \u03bb. The global coherence is\nplotted for the original RGG and other three rewired networks corresponding to p = 10\u22122 , 10\u22121 and 1.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nTo inspect how the synchronization transition of the N Kuramoto oscillators depends on the\nunderlying topology, we have performed extensive numerical simulations of the model in the RGG\nand the rewired networks. Starting from \u03bb = 0, we increase it at small intervals. The natural\nfrequencies and the initial values of \u03b8i are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution in the\ninterval (\u22121/2, 1/2) and (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0), respectively. Then, we integrate the equations of motion Eq. (1)\nusing a 4th order Runge-Kutta method over a sufficiently large period of time to ensure that the\norder parameter r reaches a stationary value. The procedure is repeated gradually increasing \u03bb.\nFigure 2 shows the synchronization diagram r(\u03bb) for the RGG and three rewired versions\n(p = 10\u22122 , p = 10\u22121 and p = 1). For low values of the coupling \u03bb it is observed that the RGG\nachieves local coherence (r > 0) slightly faster than its rewired versions. However, the transition\nto global synchronization (r = 1) shows two clearly different behaviors. For both the RGG and\nthe randomized network with p = 10\u22122 the transition are extremely slow and the global coherence\nis finally attained (not shown in figure) at very high values of \u03bb. This resistance of the network to\nachieve global synchronization disappears for the other two rewired networks studied, p = 10\u22121\nand p = 1 (the ER network). These two qualitative different behaviors in the synchronization\ntransition can be understood by looking at the evolution of the clustering coefficent in Fig. 1. It\nseems clear that the high clustering coefficient present both in the RGG and those networks with\np = 10\u22122 is at the root of the extremely slow convergence to r = 1.\n\n6\n\n\f\u03bbN/\u03bb2\n\n103\n\n102\nRGG (rewired)\nSF\nER\n\n101 -4\n10\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\np\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3: Synchronizability of the rewired networks as a function of the fraction of rewired links p. The\nsynchronizability is measured as the eigenratio \u03bbN /\u03bb2 (the ratio between the largest and the first nonvanishing eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix). We have also plotted the value of this eigenratio for SF and\nER networks with the same number of nodes N and average connectivity hki.\n\nWe next focus our attention on the stability of the synchronized state. As noted before, we\ncan now abandon the specifics of a model and work for generic dynamical systems under just a\nfew restrictions (for more details of the formalism and the conditions for its application, see, for\ninstance [Boccaletti et al, 2006] and references therein). In a series of previous works [Barahona\n& Pecora, 2002; Nishikawa et al., 2003; Motter et al., 2005; Donetti et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2006;\nChavez et al., 2005], it has been established a relation between the dynamical behavior of the units\nclose to the synchronization manifold and the eigenvalues of the (static) matrix that accounts for\nthe individual dynamics. As was first shown by Barahona and Pecora [2002], the synchronizability\n(linear stability of the synchronized state) depends on the ratio between the largest and the smallest\nnon-zero eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, that is related to the adjacency matrix by means of\nLij = ki \u03b4ij \u2212 Aij .\n\n(3)\n\nLater on, this framework has been extended to a more general situation in which networks can be\ndirected and/or weighted and the Laplacian is no longer the matrix that appears explicitly in the\nequations of motion. In any case there is a clear mapping between the ratio of the two extremal\neigenvalues and the stability of the synchronized state.\nIn a different scenario, Arenas et al. [2006] showed that the relation between spectral properties and dynamics goes far beyond the stability of the synchronized state.

In that case a plateau in the spectral representation\n(degeneracy of the eigenvalues) is related to the synchronization stability of clusters of oscillators\nthat form the topological communities. Here it is important to notice that the approximation of\nphase oscillators coupled through the sine of the phase difference is very close to its linear counterpart, the main difference being in the initial stage of the evolution when phase differences are\nnot small. But when clusters of synchronized oscillators form the difference is so small in all\npairs of interacting oscillators that the approximation is very good and explains the accuracy of\nthe mapping between the two representations [Arenas et al., 2006].\nAnother interesting finding is that the time needed for the whole system to synchronize can be\nshown to depend mainly on the smallest nonzero eigenvalue \u03bb2 . In the above picture it corresponds\nto the behavior at long times. In [Almendral & D\u0131\u0301az-Guilera, 2007] it is analytically proven\nthat this dependence for the linear case is Tsync \u223c 1/\u03bb2. For other dynamics, as the Kuramoto\noscillators, it is shown that this dependence is maintained although the prefactors can be relevant\nand we can have a rough idea on the scaling of the time for a set of comparable networks but we\ncannot infer the time a single network will need to get completely synchronized.\nHowever, these two facts put together can be very helpful in understanding the dynamics of\nKuramoto oscillators in a network like RGG. In Fig. 3 we plot the synchronizability for the\noriginal RGG and the rewired versions. There we see that the ratio decays about two orders of\nmagnitude from the original RGG to the completely rewired, i.e. ER equivalent. Since the largest\neigenvalue depends mainly on the maximum degree of the nodes, we can infer that it is the second\neigenvalue the responsible for such a decay. This also means that the RGG network should need\nabout two orders of magnitude more in time to get synchronized. For the size of the networks we\nare considering and the accuracy necessary for any detailed discussion this makes this time scale\nto be out of our available computer resources at this moment. But we can make some predictions\nabout this time, although this assumption has to be taken with care. In Fig. 4 we have plotted, as\nsuggested above for networks with community structure, the index of the eigenvalue as a function\nof the inverse of its numerical value for the original RGG and for the completely rewired one.\nWe can see in these curves the different organization of the set of eigenvalues. While for the ER\ngraph there is a rapid decay, for the RGG there is a slow and systematic drop. We can proceed\nin identifying the spectrum of the Laplacian with the synchronization dynamics, even if there is\nno community structure. This is what is represented in the other curves of Fig. 4, the number\nof synchronized components as a function of time for the same two networks. This number is\n9\n\n\fobtained following the method introduced in [Arenas et al., 2006]. Notice that the ER graph\nfollows a similar rapid drop, meaning that synchronization takes place in a very fast scale once the\ninitial readjustments of phase have taken place. But for the RGG we cannot proceed to complete\nsynchronization because of computer time limitations but we can notice the similarity in the slope\nof the two curves, clusters of oscillators get synchronized following the spectrum of the Laplacian\nmatrix. If we extrapolate this behavior we can infer an approximation for the time needed for the\nRGG network to get completely synchronized.\nGoing back to the results depicted in Fig. 3, we see that the completely synchronized state in\nRGGs is the less stable of all the networks considered. Namely, the RGG performs worse than\nscale-free networks and random graphs in the region of the phase diagram where the coupling\nstrength is high enough as to achieve full synchronization in all graphs. Therefore, if the synchronizability of a network is measured as the robustness of the completely synchronized state of\nthe system, RGGs are not the best architecture. This behavior, however, can be radically changed\nby adding a few long range connections to the network. Through this rewiring mechanism, the\nsynchronizability of RGG is improved well beyond that of scale-free networks as shown in Fig. 3\nfor p \u2265 10\u22122 .\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have explored the synchronization properties of RGGs. In order to inspect the onset of\nsynchronization and partially synchronized states, we have made use of the Kuramoto model and\nshowed that RGGs start to show some degree of synchrony roughly at the same critical value\nof the coupling strength found for random graphs. However, the former networks are harder\nto synchronize completely. Once the fully synchronized state is achieved, this state is the less\nrobust compared to other classes of complex networks. A rewiring mechanism can easily solve\nthe problem by adding just a few shortcuts to the network, which provokes both a faster landing\non the fully synchronized state and an increase of its robustness.\nIn summary, the results here obtained allow to rank RGG as not particularly suitable for synchronization phenomena \u2212 all the elements of the system are hard to synchronize and once this\nstate is attained, it is the less robust. On one hand, these are bad news given the crucial role\nthat synchronization processes plays in these systems. On the other hand, the fact that by simply\nadding some shortcuts to the system its synchronization performance greatly improves constitutes\n10\n\n\fthe good news. This is in particular the case in the context of wireless ad-hoc networks where\nsuch shortcuts can be achieved using advanced technologies such as transmit power control and\ndirectional antennas. Future research should confirm our preliminary insights by incorporating\nmore details of the structure and dynamics of wireless systems and should also test whether or not\nthe proposed rewiring mechanism is effective.\n\nV.
