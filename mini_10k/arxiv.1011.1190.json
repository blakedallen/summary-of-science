Qubits (e.g. photons) are distributed over this quantum channel, and in\npractical implementations the number of these particles\nis finite. Dealing with these finite resources, a new branch\nin quantum key distribution (QKD) emerged, the finitekey analysis. It investigates secure key rates, i.e. the\nratio of a secure key length to the number of signals\nsent through the channel, in the non-asymptotic situation. The security of a finite key for a composable security definition [2\u20134] was proven in [5\u201310]. It is important\nto notice that composability means that the key established by QKD can be used safely in any application such\nas one-time-pad encryption. For a review on practical\nQKD and its security, see e.g. Refs. [11, 12]. Calculations of finite key rates were done in [9, 13, 14] and in\n[15] for d dimensions. The relevance of finite QKD was\nshown in [16]: practical implementations of QKD lead\nto a dramatically lower secure key rate in comparison to\nasymptotic theoretical predictions.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we describe a general QKD protocol, in Sec. III we review a\nbound for the statistical error in parameter estimation\nand show that former results on the secret key rate [9] can\nbe improved by considering a POVM with two outcomes.\nIn Sec. IV we concentrate on quantifying the secret key\nlength after privacy amplification. It was found in [9, 10]\nthat the conditional min-entropy gives an achievable upper bound on the secret key length. The calculation\nof the conditional min-entropy involves an optimization\nover a set of quantum states. A lower bound on the\nmin-entropy by using the conditional von Neumann entropy was established in [9, 10]. This bound holds under\nthe assumption of collective attacks, i.e. the state shared\n\n\u2217\n\nbratzik@thphy.uni-duesseldorf.de\n\nbetween Alice and Bob after Eve's interaction has tensor product structure. In Sec. V we calculate the minentropy explicitly by applying recent results on its operational meaning [17]. For the qubit case, we evaluate the\nmin-entropy for the BB84-protocol [1] via minimum-error\ndiscrimination (MED). For d-dimensional quantum systems, we calculate it for the generalized six-state-protocol\n[18, 19] via the square-root measurement. In Sec. VI\nwe compare the key rates via calculation of the minentropy to the bound with the von Neumann entropy.\nWe show that our approach gives positive key rates for\na smaller number of signals compared to the von Neumann approach. Furthermore we compare our results in\nthe d-dimensional case to the recent results in [15] for the\nmentioned bound. We conclude in Sec. VII.\nII.\n\nQUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION\nPROTOCOL\n\nWe consider an entanglement-based QKD scheme. In\nthe following a description of the protocol will be provided.\n1. Distribution: Alice prepares N maximally entangled\nstates in dimension d \u00d7 d, where d is the dimension of the\nHilbert space of a subsystem:\nd\u22121\n\n1 X\n|\u03a600 i := \u221a\n|xxi ,\nd x=0\n\n(1)\n\nand sends the second particle to Bob. In the case of\nqubits, i.e. d = 2, the state is one of the four Bell-states\n|\u03a6+ i. After the distribution, they share N entangled\npairs, which we will denote by the state \u03c1\u0303AN B N . Under\nthe assumption of collective attacks, the state \u03c1\u0303AN B N is\n\u2297N\na tensor product state, i.e. \u03c1\u0303AN B N = (\u03c1AB )\n[9]. Alice\nand Bob can symmetrize the state \u03c1AB by applying a depolarizing map, leading to a d2 -dimensional Bell-diagonal\nstate [6, 7, 15]:\n\u03c1AB =\n\nd\u22121\nX\nj,k=0\n\n\u03bbjk |\u03a6jk i h\u03a6jk | ,\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nwhere |\u03a6jk i =\n\n\u221a1\nd\n\nPd\u22121 \u0010\ns=0\n\ne\n\n2\u03c0i\nd\n\n\u0011sk\n\n|si |(s + j) mod di are\n\nthe generalized Bell states [20]. For d = 2, the state \u03c1AB\nhas the following form:\n\u03c1AB = \u03bb00 P|\u03a6+ i + \u03bb01 P|\u03a6\u2212 i + \u03bb10 P|\u03a8+ i + \u03bb11 P|\u03a8\u2212 i , (3)\nP\nwhere P|\u03c8i\n=\n|\u03c8i h\u03c8|,\n=\n1 and\ni,j \u03bbij\n{|\u03a6+ i , |\u03a6\u2212 i , |\u03a8+ i , |\u03a8\u2212 i} is the Bell basis.\nFor a specific depolarizing map, one can parametrize\nthe state \u03c1AB by one parameter Q, which in the twodimensional case is the quantum bit error rate (QBER).\nThe relation between Q and \u03bbjk will be explained in\nSec. V.\n2. Encoding and measurement: Both parties agree on\nan encoding, i.e. each quantum state is associated with\na symbol from an alphabet. They perform a projection\nmeasurement in certain bases.\nAfter this step Alice and Bob will share N correlated\npairs of d its (d-letter systems).\n3. Sifting: In this step both parties announce for each\nqudit pair the encoding they have chosen. Depending\non the protocol either they discard the data, when they\ndiffer, or they use them for parameter estimation. The\nbit string after this process has length N \u2212 n0 , when n0\nbits were discarded.\n4. Parameter estimation (PE): Parameter estimation\nserves for estimating the error in the quantum channel by using measurements, in general a positive operator valued measure (POVM). The considered state is\nparametrized by the quantum bit error rate (QBER) Q\nfor d = 2. To measure the QBER a chosen POVM is\nused. Due to the finite number of signals (m randomly\nchosen signals are used) the QBER cannot be detected\nperfectly. Therefore a quantification of the statistical error is needed.\nAfter parameter estimation the number of signal states\nis n = N \u2212 n0 \u2212 m.\n5. Error correction (EC): In this step Alice and Bob\nwant to eliminate the error in their classical data, which\nmight be there because of eavesdropping. In order to\nreconcile their data, they have to communicate publicly.\nIn this paper, we will use known results [9] to account for\nthe effect of error correction on the key.\n6. Privacy amplification (PA): During the key generation, information about the key might have been revealed\nto the eavesdropper. To reduce this information, Alice\nand Bob apply a randomly chosen hash function from a\nfamily of hash functions to their identical keys.\n\nIII.\n\nIMPROVED PARAMETER ESTIMATION\n\nParameter estimation plays an important role in finite QKD protocols. Since one has a finite number of\nmeasurement outcomes, one needs an appropriate estimate for each parameter. In this section we first remind\nthe reader of a method for parameter estimation used in\n\n[9, 14, 21]. There, the parameters were estimated by different two-dimensional POVMs for different bases. We\nwill then show that we can reach a better approximation,\nif we consider one specific POVM for the estimation of\nall parameters. The following theorem quantifies the unavoidable statistical errors in the estimated parameters.\n|\u03c7|\n\nTheorem 1. [9, 14, 21] Let {Bi }i=1 be a |\u03c7|-dimensional\nPOVM, ~\u03bbm = (\u03bbm (1), \u03bbm (2), .., \u03bbm (|\u03c7|)) and ~\u03bb\u221e =\n(\u03bb\u221e (1), \u03bb\u221e (2), .., \u03bb\u221e (|\u03c7|)) the probability distributions,\nwith \u03bb(i) being the probability of outcome Bi . Here, the\nindex m stands for the m-fold independent application of\nthe POVM on identical states \u03c1. Let now \u03bbm := \u03bbm (k),\n\u03bb\u221e := \u03bb\u221e (k) denote any k-th parameter. Then except\nwith probability \u03b5PE\n1\n||\u03bbm \u2212 \u03bb\u221e ||1 \u2264 \u03be(\u03b5PE , |\u03c7|, m),\n2\n\n\u03be(\u03b5PE , |\u03c7|, m) :=\n\nv \u0010\n\u0011\nu\nu ln 1 + |\u03c7| ln (m + 1)\nt\n\u03b5PE\n8m\n\n(4)\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\n\u221a\nwhere ||A||1 = tr A\u2020 A and ln denotes the natural logarithm [22].\nProof: See Appendix.\nTo clarify the influence of different choices of POVMs\non secure key rates we consider a protocol, where Alice\nand Bob share a state, which can be parametrized by nPE\nparameters. We choose the variables of the estimation of\neach parameter in a symmetric way. That means \u03b5PEi =\n\u03b5PE\nm\nfor all i \u2208 {1, ..., nPE }, such\nnPE , |\u03c7|i = |\u03c7|, mi =\nPE\nPnnPE\nPnPE\nthat the constraints i=1 \u03b5PEi = \u03b5PE and i=1\nmi = m\nare fulfilled.\nIn previous works [9, 14] each parameter is estimated\nby an individual two-dimensional POVM (in the following we will use IPOVM as an abbreviation for this approach); e.g. for the BB84 protocol, we have two parameters (error rates in two bases) to estimate. Then we\nneed two POVMs, where each of them has two outcomes\nwhich correspond to \"Alice and Bob do have the same\nmeasurement outcome\" and \"Alice and Bob do not have\nthe same measurement outcome\" in their respective meam\nsurement basis. This leads to \u03be( \u03b5PE\n2 , 2, 2 ). Generally for\n\u03b5PE\nstates determined by nPE we get \u03be( nPE , 2, nm\n) for each\nPE\nparameter.\nConcerning secure key rates we can improve this\nmethod by considering a common POVM with nPE +\n1 measurement outcomes (CPOVM approach). This\nmeans for example for the BB84 protocol that we use a\nPOVM with 3 outcomes, where two of them correspond\nto \"Alice and Bob do not have the same measurement\noutcome\" in each of the two bases and one corresponds\nto the completeness of the POVM. Then, the estimation\nof each parameter will be represented by \u03be(\u03b5PE , 3, m).\nIn general for nPE + 1-dimensional systems the deviation from the perfect parameter (see Eq. (4)) is given\n\n\f3\nby \u03be(\u03b5PE , nPE + 1, m). The improvement is due to the\nfact that in Eq. (4) the trace distance is only bounded\nby \u03be(\u03b5PE , |\u03c7|, m) and that the parameters according to\nthe CPOVM approach lead to a smaller bound than the\nIPOVM approach. The results of an explicit calculation\nof the key rates will be provided in the last section.\n\nIV.\n\nPRIVACY AMPLIFICATION AND THE\n\u03b5\u0304-SMOOTH MIN-ENTROPY\n\nIn this section, we will present some results about the\nmin-entropy. Starting from the connection of the minentropy to the secure key length after the privacy amplification step, we review the relation of the min-entropy\nto the guessing probability given in [17].\n\nwith\nHmin (\u03c1\u0304XE |E) = sup [\u2212 log2 (min \u03bb : \u03bb * 1X \u2297 \u03c3E \u2265 \u03c1\u0304XE )] .\n\u03c3E\n\n(8)\nThe optimization in Eq. (7) is done over the states \u03c1\u0304XE\nin the \u03b5\u0304-environment of \u03c1XE , whereas the optimization\nin Eq. (8) is over all states \u03c3E .\nB.\n\nThe min-entropy and the guessing probability\n\nThe evaluation in Eq. (7) is a convex optimization\nproblem. It was shown in [17], that the min-entropy can\nbe rewritten as the negative logarithm of the optimal\nguessing probability pguess :\nHmin (\u03c1XE |E) = \u2212 log2 pguess ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\nA.\n\nThe \u03b5\u0304-smooth min-entropy and the secure key\nlength `\n\npguess \u2261 pguess (X|E) := max\nx\n\n{EE }\n\nThe \u03b5\u0304-smooth conditional min-entropy provides an upper bound for the secure key length ` after the privacy\namplification step [10]:\n\u03b5\u0304\nn\n` / Hmin\n(\u03c1\u2297n\nXE |E ),\n\n(6)\n\nPd\u22121\nwhere \u03c1XE = x=0 px |xi hx|\u2297\u03c1xE is a classical-quantumstate, which Alice and the eavesdropper Eve share after\nerror correction. Here, X is Alice's random variable with\nvalues x \u2208 {0, ..., d \u2212 1}, where d is the dimension of the\nquantum system. The eavesdropper holds a quantum\nstate \u03c1xE , which is correlated with the random variable\nX. The symbol E n denotes the eavesdropper's system.\nThe parameter n is the number of signals after sifting\nand parameter estimation, i.e. n = N \u2212 n0 \u2212 m.\nIn the following we will denote the state \u03c1XE as a\nsingle-signal state, i.e. following the description above,\nboth parties share one single state (n = 1). Otherwise,\nthe state will be denoted by \u03c1\u2297n\nXE , if it has tensor product\nstructure. We treat collective attacks, as the state shared\nbetween Alice and Eve has in this case tensor product\nstructure. Collective attacks [23? ] are those attacks\nwhere the eavesdropper is restricted to interact with each\nof the signals separately, i.e. by attaching an auxiliary\nsystem and performing unitary transformations. In [6, 7]\nit was shown that it suffices to consider a convex combination of product states, when analyzing the full security\nof QKD protocols. However, it does not follow that we\ncan consider w.l.o.g. a product state.\nWe recall the definition of the \u03b5\u0304-smooth min-entropy:\nDefinition 1 (\u03b5\u0304-smooth min-entropy [10]). Let \u03c1\u0304XE \u2208\nB \u03b5\u0304/2 (\u03c1XE ) := {\u03c1\u0304XE \u2265 0 : \u03c1\u0304XE \u2212 \u03c1XE 1 \u2264 \u03b5\u0304}. The\n\u03b5\u0304-smooth min-entropy is defined as:\n\u03b5\u0304\nHmin\n(\u03c1XE |E) := sup Hmin (\u03c1\u0304XE |E),\n\u03c1\u0304XE\n\n(7)\n\nd\u22121\nX\n\nx x\npx tr(EE\n\u03c1E ).\n\n(10)\n\nx=0\n\nHere it was used that the initial state \u03c1XE is a classicalquantum state (see above), which is shared between Alx\nice and Eve, the eavesdropper. The set {EE\n} denotes the\nPOVM elements of Eve, which she uses in order to distinguish her nonorthogonal ancilla states \u03c1xE . If she could\nperfectly discriminate them, she would know the value of\nAlice's random variable X and therefore the content of\nthe secret key.\nV.\n\nEVALUATION OF THE GUESSING\nPROBABILITY\n\nIn this section we will present an explicit calculation\nof the guessing probability in Eq. (10) for d-dimensional\nquantum systems for the generalized six-state-protocol\nvia square-root measurement (see e.g. [24\u201329]), and\nfor qubit-systems (d = 2) for the BB84-protocol via\nminimum-error discrimination [26, 30\u201333]. The problem\nof distinguishing two mixed quantum states with minimum error was solved by Helstr\u00f8m [32], but for more\nstates it becomes more involved. For quantum states\nwith a certain symmetry, optimal measurements were\nfound (see e.g. [29]), whereas for arbitrary states only\nbounds exist [34]. Finally, we draw a conclusion from the\nadditivity of the min-entropy for tensor product states:\nfor a set of symmetric tensor product states the optimal minimum-error discrimination (MED) measurement\nis the optimal MED measurement on the subsystems.\nA.\n\nGeneralized six-state-protocol for d-dimensional\nquantum systems\n\nIn this part we consider a (d + 1)-bases protocol, which\nwas introduced in [35\u201337]. It is a generalization of the\n\n\f4\nsix-state protocol [18, 19]. We further assume a collective\neavesdropping attack. Due to symmetrizations [6] the\neavesdropper is forced to introduce the same error in each\nmeasurement basis. This symmetrization leads to the\nfollowing Bell-diagonal state shared between Alice and\nBob (see Section II):\n\u03c1AB = (\u03b20 \u2212 \u03b21 ) |\u03a600 i h\u03a600 | +\n\n\u03b21\n1d2 ,\nd\n\n(11)\n\nwith \u03b20 + (d \u2212 1)\u03b21 = 1, 0 \u2264 \u03b21 < d1 < \u03b20 \u2264 1 and 1d2\nbeing the identity matrix of size d2 . Note that this form\nis equal to the one considered in [38, 39]. The parameter\n\u03b20 can be seen as the probability that both get the same\noutput, whereas \u03b21 denotes the probability that they get\na particular other one. The error rate Q is given by\nQ := 1 \u2212 \u03b20 = (d \u2212 1)\u03b21 ; for d = 2, Q is the quantum\nbit error rate \u03b21 . The state in Eq. (11) can be recovered\nfrom Eq. (2) by setting \u03bb00 = 1 \u2212 d+1\nd (1 \u2212 \u03b20 ) and all\n\u03b21\n0)\nother \u03bbjk = (1\u2212\u03b2\n=\n.\nd(d\u22121)\nd\nWe assume that Eve holds a purification |\u03c8ABE i.

For the case x = y, Eve has to discriminate d pyramid states. Measurements for such symmetrical states\nexist, and it is known that the error-minimizing measurement for such states is the square-root measurement\n[24\u201329]. The following results for the tomographic protocol were derived in [39, 40]:\nThe state in Eq. (12) can be rewritten as:\n\u03c1E = \u03b20 \u03c1(=) + (1 \u2212 \u03b20 )\u03c1(6=) ,\n\nPd\u22121\nwhere the density operator \u03c1(=) = d1 x=0 |Exx i hExx |\ndenotes the cases, when Alice and Bob have the\nsame P\nvalues, whereas in the case of \u03c1(6=) =\n1\ny6=x |Exy i hExy | their values are different. The\nd(d\u22121)\neavesdropper wants to find their common values, so she\nwants to discriminate those ancilla states for x = y. The\nPOVM elements |exx i hexx |, that discriminate the pyramid states with minimum error, are given via\n|exx i = p\n\np\n\nd\u03c1(=)\n\nwhere r0 = 1 \u2212\nx\nx \u03c1E .\n\nP\n\nsuch that Eve's state is given by \u03c1E =\nEve's\nancilla states |Exy i have a specific form in order to fulfill\nthe requirement in Eq.

In MED for each measurement one has a\nconclusive result, but with probability perr the result is\nerroneous. It was shown by Helstr\u00f8m [32] that the maximal probability to make a correct guess when distinguishing two quantum states \u03c10E and \u03c11E that appear with the\nsame probability p0 = p1 = 21 is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1 0\nmin\n1\npguess (2, Q) = 1 \u2212 perr =\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1E 1 .

(13)) in terms of the computational\nbasis of Eve.\nAssuming that Eve has a purifying system of the state\nin Eq. (3), and that Alice and Bob perform a von Neumann measurement, one can derive an expression for\n\u03c10E \u2212 \u03c11E 1 for the BB84-protocol.

There remains one free parameter, that we have to optimize to\nobtain the best case for Eve. We adopt the method in\n[12, Appendix A] to maximize the probability of correct guess in Eq. (17): according to [12], we choose\n\u03bb00 = (1 \u2212 Q)(1 \u2212 u), \u03bb01 = (1 \u2212 Q)u, \u03bb10 = Q(1 \u2212 v) and\n\u03bb11 = Qv, with u, v \u2208 [0, 1] and the additional constraint\n(from \u03bb01 + \u03bb11 = Q)\n(1 \u2212 Q)u + Qv = Q.\n\n(21)\n\nDefining |\u03a6ij i as the corresponding Bell states to the\nvalue \u03bbij , the purification\nof the state \u03c1AB can be written\nP p\nas |\u03c8ABE i = ij \u03bbij |\u03a6ij iAB \u2297 |eij iE , where {|eij i} is\na four-dimensional orthonormal basis.

The\nexplicit minimum-error discrimination problem is to distinguish the set of states {\u03c1xE n } for different x. We can\nconclude from the additivity of the min-entropy, that for\nthe set of states given in Eq. (27) the optimal MED measurement consists of optimal MED measurements on the\nsingle-signal states \u03c1xEi . This result is interesting, as in\ngeneral measurements in the total Hilbert space may lead\nto higher guessing probabilities than measurements in individual subspaces. To the best of our knowledge, this\nresult is not known in the context of state discrimination.\nVI.\n\nCOMPARISON OF KEY RATES\n\nIn this chapter we provide the results of parameter estimation with CPOVM (see Sec. III) and those of the\n\n\f6\ncalculation of the min-entropy (see Sec. V). We first review some results about finite-key distribution.\nFor a finite number of signals, the achievable secure\nkey rate is found to be [9, 14]:\nn\n2\n(S\u03be (\u03c1XE |E) + \u2206 \u2212 leakEC ) +\nlog2 (2\u03b5PA ) ,\nN\nN\n(29)\nq\nlog2 (2/\u03b5\u0304)\nwith \u2206 := \u22127\n, the total security parameter \u03b5\nn\n(see e.g. [14, 21])\n`1 /N =\n\n\u03b5 = \u03b5PA + \u03b5EC + \u03b5PE + \u03b5\u0304\n\nand for the BB84-protocol\nS BB84 (\u03c1XE |E) = 1 \u2212 h(Q).\n\nThe variables \u03be for parameter estimation used in this\ncomparison are summarized in Tab. I. Note that the symmetrized state is parametrized by only one parameter.\nThis has no influence on the IPOVM approach, in contrast to CPOVM, where the number of POVM outcomes\ncan be reduced from 3 for BB84 (4 for six-state) to 2 (2).\nBB84\n\n(30)\n\nand S\u03be (\u03c1XE |E) := min\u03c1\u0304XE \u2208\u0393\u03be S(\u03c1XE |E). The set \u0393\u03be =\n{\u03c3 : 21 |\u03bbm \u2212 \u03bb\u221e (\u03c3)| \u2264 \u03be} contains all states compatible\nwith the statistics in parameter estimation. The conditional von Neumann entropy with the correction term\n\u2206 is a lower bound on the \u03b5\u0304-smooth min-entropy. The\nleakage term leakEC is taken from [12] to be leakEC =\n1.2h(Q) for \u03b5EC = 10\u221210 , where h(x) is the binary entropy. Throughout all calculations, we assume asymmetric protocols with a symmetric attack. An asymmetric\nprotocol means that one only keeps the measurement results of one particular basis for the key; the other results\nare used for parameter estimation. In the case of protocols with (d + 1) bases (e.g. the six-state protocol with\nd = 2) this basis is chosen with probability q = (1 \u2212 dp)\nand the other d bases with probability p. For protocols with 2 bases (e.g. the BB84-protocol with d = 2)\nq = 1 \u2212 p. Taking the largest deviation \u03bei from the perfect parameter in one measurement basis and equating\nit with the other deviations, leads to a symmetric choice\nm\nof parameters mi and \u03b5PEi , i.e. mi = d+1\n(mi = m\n2 for\n\u03b5PE\n2\u2212bases protocols) and \u03b5PEi = d+1 (\u03b5PEi = \u03b5PE\n)\n(see\n2\nsection III). This assumption gives a lower bound on the\nsecret key rate. The number of signals used for parameter\nestimation is given by m = N p2 .\nIn order to calculate the key rate, we fix \u03b5 and \u03b5EC and\nmaximize `1 /N in Eq. (29) for the parameters \u03b5PE , \u03b5PA , \u03b5\u0304\nand q with a computational software program (Mathematica) under the constraint given in Eq.

Deviations \u03be from perfect parameter (see Eq. (4)\nin Sec. III) for different parameter estimation approaches\n(IPOVM and CPOVM): BB84 and six-state protocol.\n\nThe results are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. We point\nout that our CPOVM approach leads to higher key rates\nfor the BB84- and six-state-protocol. In particular for\nsignals N . 1011 , the numerical analysis reveals the importance of parameter estimation. While the CPOVM\napproach leads for N = 106 signals to a 72% (35%)\nhigher key rate than the IPOVM approach for the sixstate- (BB84-) protocol, the improvement for N = 1010\nis still 3% (2%).\n\nA. Key rates via von Neumann entropy for\ndifferent approaches of parameter estimation\n\nFor a comparison of the approaches (IPOVM,\nCPOVM) explained in Sec. III we consider the asymmetric BB84- and six-state-protocol for a symmetric attack\nfor dimension d = 2 as discussed in [9]. In the calculation of the key rates via the von Neumann entropy (see\nEq. (29)) we use a QBER of Q = 0.05 and a total security\nparameter of \u03b5 = 10\u22129 (see Eq. (30)). The conditional\nvon Neumann entropy for the six-state protocol is given\nby [9, 12]:\nS\n\nsix\u2212state\n\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1 \u2212 32 Q\n(\u03c1XE |E) = (1 \u2212 Q) 1 \u2212 h\n(31)\n1\u2212Q\n\nFIG. 1.

IV that the achievable upper\nbound on the secure key length ` after the privacy amplification step is given by Eq. (6). We can derive a key\nrate by using the following bounds [10, Lemma 3.2.6]:\n\u03b5\u0304/n\n\n\u03b5\u0304\nn\nHmin\n(\u03c1\u2297n\nXE |E ) \u2265 nHmin (\u03c1XE |E) \u2265 nHmin (\u03c1XE |E);\n(33)\nthe last inequality is a very good approximation as \u03b5\u0304 is\nin the order of 10\u221210 . Thus, we arrive at the following\nkey rate:\n\nn\n2\n(Hmin,\u03be (\u03c1XE |E) \u2212 leakEC ) +\nlog2 (2\u03b5PA ) ,\nN\nN\n(34)\nwhere the leakage term leakEC and \u03b5PA are the\nsame as in Eq. (29), and Hmin,\u03be (\u03c1XE |E) :=\nmin\u03c1\u0304XE \u2208\u0393\u03be Hmin (\u03c1XE |E) (see Eq. (29)). We calculate this key rate using the connection to the guessing\nprotocol\nprobability, i.e. Hmin\n(\u03c1XE |E) = \u2212 log2 pprotocol\n(see\nguess\nEq. (9)), and compare it to the key rate given in Eq. (29).\nThe guessing probability for the specific protocol is given\nby Eqs. (23) and (24).\nIn Fig. 3 the threshold number of signals N0 , where the\nkey rate becomes non-zero, is plotted as a function of the\nQBER Q. For parameter estimation, we have considered\nthe CPOVM approach (see Sec. III) with the variables\ngiven in Tab. I. Additionally, we have plotted the key\nrate via the von Neumann entropy (Eq.

(29)), only 1/2 (7/10) of the number\nof signals is needed for non-zero key rates in the six-stateprotocol for Q = 0.2% (Q = 3.8%), when using the minentropy. For the BB84-protocol, only 1/2 (9/10) of the\nnumber of signals is needed for Q = 0.2% (Q = 3.8%).\n`2 /N =\n\nFIG. 3.

III for\nexplanations).\n\nThus, by calculating a key rate explicitly with the minentropy, we get positive key rates for a smaller number\nof signals than via the von Neumann entropy approach.\nThis behavior can be explained by the correction term \u2206\nin the key rate in Eq. (29). For a small number of total\nsignals N , this correction term is not a good approximation and has a big impact on the key rate.\nWe point out that for low Q we can achieve non-zero\nkey rates with only O(104 ) \u2212 O(105 ) signals. Note that\nin [41] it was considered a \"milestone\" to reach non-zero\nkey rates for significantly less than 105 \u2212 106 signals.\n\nC.\n\nKey rates via the min-entropy for d-dimensional\nquantum systems\n\nIn [15] the influence of the dimension on the key rate\nwas discussed. Exploiting the results from this paper,\nwe discuss the improvement for higher-dimensional quantum systems. Throughout this part we only consider the\n(d + 1)-bases protocols, such as the six-state-protocol for\nd = 2. Furthermore, we adapt our CPOVM approach\nand by using Eq. (4) from Sec. III we get \u03be (\u03b5PE , 2, m).\nThe correction term to the d-dimensional von q\nNeumann\nentropy is given in [42] as \u2206 = \u2212(2 log2 d + 3) log2n(2/\u03b5\u0304)\nand the leakage term is characterized\nby leakEC =\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\n1.2hd (Q) with hd (p) := \u2212p log2 d\u22121\n\u2212(1\u2212p) log2 (1\u2212p).\nThe conditional von Neumann entropy was calculated in\n\n\f8\n[15] as\n\"\nd\n\nS (\u03c1XE |E) = (1 \u2212 Q) log2 d \u2212 hd\n\n1 \u2212 d+1\nd Q\n1\u2212\n1\u2212Q\n\n!#\n,\n\n(35)\nwhere Q = 1 \u2212 \u03b20 denotes the error rate in the sifted\nkey. We will compare the key rate calculated via the ddimensional conditional von Neumann entropy, with the\none via the d-dimensional min-entropy. The latter can\nbe obtained by using\nd\nHmin\n(\u03c1XE |E) = \u2212 log2 pguess (d, Q),\n\n(36)\n\nwhere pguess (d, Q) was given in Eq. (16).\nIn order to quantify the number of signals, we have\nscaled N0 with log2 d, as for example sending one state\nin the dimension d = 4 corresponds to sending two states\nin the dimension d = 2. For making the key rate comparable to the two-dimensional case, it has to be divided by\nlog2 d. The dimensions are prime numbers as complete\nmutually unbiased bases can be formed for primes and\nprime powers (see e.g. review article [43]).\n\nFIG. 4. (Color online) Key rates with d-dimensional conditional von Neumann entropy (Eq. (35)) plotted versus scaled\ntotal number of signals for a fixed error rate Q = 5%. This\nis analogous to [15], where a different scale was used for the\naxes.\n\nFigure 4 shows the behavior of the key rate calculated\nwith Eq. (35) for different dimensions. In contrast to\n[15], we scaled the key rate with the dimension. It can\nbe seen from the plot, that higher dimensions are advantageous as the key rate increases. In order to obtain the\nbehavior for a small number of signals, Fig. 5 provides\na magnification of this area. The higher the dimension,\nthe more the point, where the key rate becomes non-zero\nis shifted to the right (apart from the case d = 2). This\nmight be due to the correction term, as it scales linearly\nwith the dimension, so for higher dimension, more is subtracted from the conditional von Neumann entropy. We\nwill see in the next paragraph, that the min-entropy ap-\n\nFIG. 5. (Color online) Key rates with d-dimensional conditional von Neumann entropy (Eq.

Dashed\nline: min-entropy (Eq. (36)), straight line: von Neumann entropy (Eq. (35)).\n\nIn Fig. 6 we compare the number N0 , where the key\nrate becomes non-zero, for key rates using the quantities given in Eqs. (35) and (36) for different dimensions.\nIt can be seen that the min-entropy approach is better\nthroughout the presented error rates. The advantage of\nthe min-entropy approach (Eq. (36)) over the von Neumann approach (Eq. (35)) augments with increasing dimensions. This can be explained again with the correction term that scales linearly with the dimension. When\ncomparing higher dimensions to the qubit case, one can\nsee that for certain error rates the dimensions bigger than\n\n\f9\ntwo are advantegous. The dimension d = 3 for example,\ngives a lower threshold value N0 for non-zero key rates\nthan the qubit case throughout all the presented error\nrates.\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP|\u03c7|\nm (i)\nand using\nwith D(~\u03bbm ||~\u03bb\u221e ) := i=1 \u03bbm (i) log2 \u03bb\u03bb\u221e\n(i)\n[44]\ns\n1 ~\n\u03bbm \u2212 ~\u03bb\u221e\n2\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\u2264\n1\n\nD(~\u03bbm ||~\u03bb\u221e ) ln 2\n,\n2\n\n(A2)\n\nwe result in\n#\nr\n0 ln 2\n2\u03be\n1 ~\n\u03bbm \u2212 ~\u03bb\u221e >\nProb\n2\n2\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ees\nr\n0 ln 2\n~\u03bbm ||~\u03bb\u221e ) ln 2\n(A2)\nD(\n2\u03be\n\uf8fb\n\u2264 Prob \uf8f0\n>\n2\n2\n\"\n\nWe have improved the secret key rates in QKD with\na finite number of signals, by considering parameter estimation to be implemented by a single POVM for all\nparameters. Additionally, we have calculated the minentropy for a single-signal state in d-dimensions explicitly by using its operational meaning via the guessing\nprobability. We showed that using this ansatz for a small\nnumber of signals leads to computable non-zero key rates.\nThis advantage of the min-entropy might be due to the\ncorrection term \u2206 in key rate calculations using the conditional von Neumann entropy [9, 14, 15], as this correction is big for a small number of signals. This correction term scales linearly with the dimension, so an\nimprovement for high dimensions (up to d = 17) is found\nby calculating the min-entropy. Thus higher-dimensional\nsystems might be advantageous when resources are limited. As a spin-off, we have deduced from the additivity\nproperty of the min-entropy and its relation to the guessing probability, that the optimal minimum-error discrimination measurement (MED) for a set of tensor product\nstates with a certain symmetry is the optimal MED measurement on each subsystem.\nConsidering the importance of finite-key analysis for\npractical implementations, we have shown that non-zero\nsecure key rates can be achieved already with 104 \u2212 105\nsignals per run.\n\n(A1)\n\nlog (m+1)\n0\n\u2264 2\u2212m(2\u03be \u2212|\u03c7| m ) .\n(A3)\nq\n0\nFor \u03be := 2\u03be 2ln 2 it follows:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 ~\nProb\n\u03bbm \u2212 ~\u03bb\u221e > 2\u03be\n2\n1\n\"\n#\nr\n0 ) ln 2\n2(4\u03be\n1 ~\n= Prob\n\u03bbm \u2212 ~\u03bb\u221e >\n2\n2\n1\n\n(A3)\n\n0\n\n\u2264 2\u2212m(2(4\u03be )\u2212|\u03c7|\n\n= 2\n\nlog (m+1)\nm\n\n)\n\n\u0010 2\n\u0011\nlog (m+1)\n\u03be\n\u2212m 8 ln\n2 \u2212|\u03c7|\nm\n\n=: \u03b5PE .\n\nThen except with probability \u03b5PE , the following holds:\n1 ~\n\u03bbm \u2212 ~\u03bb\u221e\n2\nr\nwith \u03be =\n\nln\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n\u03b5PE\n\n\u0011\n\n+|\u03c7| ln (m+1)\n8m\n\n\u2264 2\u03be\n1\n\n.
