Non-supersymmetric extremal black holes with zero\ntemperature are likewise of interest. Recent progress on understanding the microscopic nature\nof non-supersymmetric zero temperature black holes includes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].\nNon-supersymmetric black hole solutions are in general more difficult to work with, not just\nin terms of understanding their microscopics, but also because they are typically not easy to\ncome by: exact solutions for non-supersymmetric black holes tend to be harder to construct\nthan their supersymmetric cousins. This is in particular true for multi-centered solutions.\nWith their harmonic functions, supersymmetric black holes can easily be superimposed, but\nnon-supersymmetric systems can exhibit strong interactions between the individual black hole\ncomponents, and the solutions are consequently more involved.\nApplication of integrability methods in higher-dimensional gravity has recently allowed\nprogress on construction of new exact black hole vacuum solutions. For instance, the inverse\nscattering technique was used in the construction of the first asymptotically flat multi-black\nhole vacuum solution [9]. The solution - named \"black saturn\" for its characteristic appearance, a black ring balanced by rotation around a spherical black hole - exhibited clear signs\nof interactions, including gravitational frame-dragging. Other novel properties included a large\ndegree of continuous non-uniqueness even for zero total angular momentum [9, 10]. The black\nsaturn system, as constructed in [9], did not have a zero temperature limit. However, based on\nthe results found in this paper, we propose the existence of an extremal zero-temperature black\nsaturn solution, and we discuss the consequences of its expected continuous non-uniqueness for\nthe phase diagram of extremal zero-temperature vacuum black holes.\nIn this paper we study two different 4+1-dimensional black hole systems with spin in the two\nindependent planes of rotation, and we pay attention particularly to limits that give extremal\nzero temperature black hole configurations.\nThe first of these systems is a new vacuum solution which we call \"bicycling black rings\",\nor simply \"bi-rings\" for short. It is a balanced configuration of two singly spinning concentric\nblack rings placed in orthogonal planes. Singly spinning means that they each carry \"intrinsic\"\nangular momentum only in the plane of the ring, i.e. spin along the S 1 direction of the horizon.\nOne can think of the system as the superposition of two of the original black rings of [11] in\northogonal planes. This is sketched in figure 1. Note that the bi-ring solution is different from\nthe so-called \"di-ring\" solutions [12, 13] where the two concentric rings lie in the same plane.\nThe bi-ring solution has three commuting Killing vectors (\"U(1)3 symmetry\"): it is stationary, and the isometry of the S 1 of one ring is the isometry of the azimuthal angle of the S 2 of\nthe other ring, and vice versa. We construct the solution using the inverse scattering method.\nThe bi-ring solution exhibits 1-fold continuous non-uniqueness after balance conditions have\nbeen imposed. This freedom corresponds to distributing the total mass between the two black\nrings.\n2\n\n\f(2)\n\nJ\u03c6\n\nring 2\n(2)\n\n\u03a9\u03c8\n\n(2)\n\u03a9\u03c6\n(1)\n\nJ\u03c8\n\nring 1\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a9\u03c8\n\n(1)\n\u03a9\u03c6\n\nFigure 1: Bicycling black rings in orthogonal planes.\nThe two black rings in the bi-ring system interact with each other. The rotation of the\nS 1 of one ring affects the S 2 of the other by gravitational frame-dragging. This causes the\nS 2 to rotate, so each ring has two non-vanishing angular velocities corresponding to rotation\nin the two independent planes. The angular momentum of the S 2 is effectively bounded by\nthe 3+1-dimensional Kerr bound. The solution has a zero temperature limit, and in order to\nunderstand what happens in this limit we study in detail another solution, namely the doubly\nspinning black ring.\nThe doubly spinning black ring solution had long been anticipated. It is a single black ring\nbalanced by angular momentum in the plane of the ring, but with angular momentum also in\nthe orthogonal plane, corresponding to rotation of the two-sphere. Kudoh [17] found branches of\nthis solution numerically, but the true breakthrough1 was Pomeransky and Sen'kov's construction of the exact doubly spinning black ring solution [18]. They used a clever implementation of\nthe inverse scattering method, and moreover presented the solution in the more intuitive ringtype coordinates [19] rather than axisymmetric coordinates which are natural for the solution\ngenerating technique. A more general unbalanced doubly spinning black ring solution has also\nbeen found [20].\nWe provide in this paper a detailed analysis of the physical properties of the PomeranskySen'kov doubly spinning black ring [18]. These results have not previously been presented in\nthe literature. Our results include the structure of the phases of doubly spinning black rings.\nWe examine two different extremal zero-temperature limits. One is shown to result in a regular\nextremely spinning zero temperature black ring solution. The other limit appears to be singular,\nbut this is just a coordinate singularity. A coordinate transformation shows that the resulting\nsolution is nothing but the extremal doubly spinning Myers-Perry black hole, which is a regular\nblack hole with zero temperature.\nThe zero-temperature limit of the bicycling black ring system is similar to the second extremal limit of the doubly spinning black ring, and thus we find evidence that the rings in this\nlimit collapse to the extremal Myers-Perry black hole.\nInspired by the analysis of the bi-ring system and the doubly spinning black ring, we speculate about the structure of the phase diagram for zero-temperature black holes. It should be\n1\n\nThe unbalanced solution describing a black ring with rotation on the S 2 had been constructed by the inverse\nscattering method [14, 15], and also independently, in a simpler form, in [16].\n\n3\n\n\femphasized that our bi-ring solution is not the most general one. The obvious generalization is\nconstructed from two doubly spinning black rings in orthogonal planes. In our discussion of the\ngeneral phase diagram we consider the possibilities of generalized bicycling black rings as well\nas their even more exotic generalizations, which include multi-bicycles (tandems) and bi-ring\nsaturns. The richness of the phase structure of higher-dimensional black holes is striking, even\nin a limit as specialized as that of zero-temperature.\nSupersymmetric versions of saturns, di-rings, bi-rings and many-ring systems can be constructed via superposition of the harmonic functions that characterize the individual black hole\ncomponents of the system. This was first done for rings in [21]. Supersymmetric saturns with\nthe black hole moved off the plane of the ring were studied in [22]. A key point in our analysis\nof the non-supersymmetric multi-black hole solutions is to track the interaction between the\nblack holes in the system; this is not possible in the supersymmetric configurations where the\nmutual BPS-ness cancels out interaction effects.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. We construct and analyze the bi-ring solution in\nsection 2. In section 3 we study in detail a subfamily of the solutions where the two orthogonal\nrings are identical. We compare the results with a simple model obtained by superimposing two\nsingly-spinning black rings and neglecting interactions. The doubly spinning black ring of [18]\nis analyzed in detail, and its physics discussed, in section 4. We describe in section 5 the zero\ntemperature scaling limit of the bi-ring solution and argue that it corresponds to a collapse to\na single extremal Myers-Perry black hole. We conclude with a discussion of zero temperature\nphases of 4+1-dimensional black holes in section 6. Two appendices are included: appendix A\ncontains details of the horizon metric for the bi-ring solution, and appendix B reviews relevant\nproperties of the Myers-Perry black hole [23].\nNote: while this work was in progress, the paper [24] appeared, presenting also an orthogonal\ntwo-ring solution.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nBicycling black rings: Construction and analysis\nConstruction\n\nThe inverse scattering method was recently used to construct the black saturn solution [9]. Our\napproach here is very similar, so we keep the presentation brief. The construction takes as input\na seed solution on which we perform a series of \"soliton transformations\" and rescalings [25].\nThe transformations introduce new parameters, called Belinsky-Zakharov (BZ) parameters,\nwhich are organized in \"BZ vectors\". For definitions and review of the method, see [9]. We\nalso refer the reader to [26, 27, 28] for literature on the inverse scattering technique and to [29]\nand [30] for Weyl solution techniques and rod diagram representations.\n2.1.1\n\nSeed solution\n\nThe seed solution is represented by the rod diagram given in figure 2.

Likewise, b2 \u2192 \u2212b2 simply corresponds to taking\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6. Thus we choose c1 and b2 to be negative without loss of generality. This choice gives\npositive angular momenta and angular velocities.\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nAnalysis\nParameterization\n\nThe solution is parameterized by the rod endpoints ai and the two BZ parameters c1 and b2 .\nThe parameters are all dimensionful. It is convenient to introduce an overall scale L,\nL2 = a7 \u2212 a1 ,\n\n(2.23)\n\nand then express the solution in terms of dimensionless parameters \u03bai defined as\n\u03bai =\n\nai+1 \u2212 a1\nL2\n\n(2.24)\n\nfor i = 1, 2, ..., 5. The ordering (2.6) implies that\n0 \u2264 \u03ba1 \u2264 \u03ba2 \u2264 \u03ba3 \u2264 \u03ba4 \u2264 \u03ba5 \u2264 1 .\n\n(2.25)\n\nIt is also useful to shift the z coordinate as\nz = L2 z\u0304 + a1 ,\n\n(2.26)\n\nso that z\u0304 is dimensionless.\nAn analysis of the metric components Gab , a, b = t, \u03c8, \u03c6, near the rod endpoints shows that\nthere are divergences near z\u0304 = 0 and z\u0304 = 1, i.e. near z = a1 and z = a7 . Just as for the\nblack saturn solution, these singularities can be eliminated by an appropriate choice of the BZ\nparameters. This fixes c1 and b2 to be3\ns\n\u221a\n2 (1 \u2212 \u03ba1 )\nL 2 \u03ba1 \u03ba2 \u03ba3 \u03ba5\n,\nb2 = \u2212L (1 \u2212 \u03ba2 )\n.\n(2.27)\nc1 = \u2212\n\u03ba4\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba3 ) (1 \u2212 \u03ba4 ) (1 \u2212 \u03ba5 )\nIn what follows we will always impose the smoothness conditions (2.27). The \u03c1 = 0 metric\nis then smooth across z\u0304 = 0 and z\u0304 = 1, and there are no signs of the negative density rods of\nthe seed solution. We describe the rod configuration of the bicycling black ring solution in the\nnext subsection.\nWith c1 and b2 fixed by (2.27), the full solution is parametrized by the five \u03bai -parameters,\nsubject to the ordering (2.25), and the scale L.\n3\nChanging the sign of the BZ parameters corresponds to reversing the sense of rotating of the rings, so\nwithout loss of generality we have assumed c1 and b2 to be negative.\n\n8\n\n\f(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1, \u03a9\u03c6 , \u03a9\u03c8 )\n\nt\n(0, 1, 0)\n\n\u03c6\n\n(2)\n\n(1, \u03a9\u03c6 , \u03a9\u03c8 )\n\n(0, 1, 0)\n\n(0, 0, 1)\n\n\u03c8\n\n0\n\n\u03ba1\n\n\u03ba2\n\n\u03ba3\n\n\u03ba4\n\n(0, 0, 1)\n\n\u03ba5\n\n1\n\nFigure 3: Rod structure of the regular bicycling black ring solution.

If not imposed, then there\nare disks of conical singularities inside the rings. When studying the physical properties of the\nbicycling ring system, we always impose both balance conditions.\nSolving the balance conditions\nWe briefly outline the strategy for solving the balance conditions in practical applications. This\nis used in section 5. The squared ratio of (2.32) and (2.33) is\n1=\n\n\u03ba3 (\u03ba3 \u2212 \u03ba2 )(\u03ba5 \u2212 \u03ba3 )2\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba3 )(\u03ba4 \u2212 \u03ba3 )(\u03ba3 \u2212 \u03ba1 )2\n\n(2.34)\n\nThis condition is linear in \u03ba2 and \u03ba4 ; solving for \u03ba4 gives\n\u03ba4 = \u03ba\u22174 \u2261 \u03ba3 +\n\n\u03ba3 (\u03ba3 \u2212 \u03ba2 )(\u03ba5 \u2212 \u03ba3 )2\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba3 )(\u03ba3 \u2212 \u03ba1 )2\n\n(2.35)\n\nClearly \u03ba3 \u2264 \u03ba\u22174 , but we must also require that \u03ba\u22174 \u2264 \u03ba5 , and that restricts the parameters on\nthe RHS of (2.35). The simplest way to express this is as an upper bound on \u03ba5 ,\n\u03ba5 \u2264 \u03ba5MAX (\u03ba1 , \u03ba2 , \u03ba3 ) \u2261\n\n\u03ba21 (1 \u2212 \u03ba3 ) \u2212 2 \u03ba1 \u03ba3 (1 \u2212 \u03ba3 ) + \u03ba23 (1 \u2212 \u03ba2 )\n.\n\u03ba3 (\u03ba3 \u2212 \u03ba2 )\n\n(2.36)\n\nThis condition ensures \u03ba3 \u2264 \u03ba\u22174 \u2264 \u03ba5 .\n5\n\nThe periodicities (2.31) follow from regularity conditions on the rods ]q\n\u2212 \u221e, \u03ba1 ] and [\u03ba5 , \u221e[. The general\n\u03c12 G\u03c1\u03c1\nregularity condition is that when G\u03c6\u03c6 \u2192 0 as \u03c1 \u2192 0 then \u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03c0 lim\u03c1\u21920\nG\u03c6\u03c6 . Likewise for \u03c8.\n\n10\n\n\fPlugging (2.35) into either of the balance conditions (2.32) or (2.33) we obtain a polynomial\nequation which is 8th order in \u03ba1 , 4th order in \u03ba2 , 7th order in \u03ba3 , and 6th order in \u03ba5 . Solving\nthis condition for \u03ba2 seems to be the simplest. As a fourth order polynomial, one can obtain the\nroots analytically, but in applications we will simply solve numerically for \u03ba2 in order to impose\nbalance. For given \u03ba1 , \u03ba3 , and \u03ba5 , we select the real root(s) \u03ba\u22172 which satisfy (a) \u03ba1 < \u03ba\u22172 < \u03ba3 ,\nand (b) \u03ba5 \u2264 \u03ba5MAX (\u03ba1 , \u03ba\u22172 , \u03ba3 ).\nImposing both balance conditions leaves the bi-ring solution with three dimensionless parameters 0 < \u03ba1 < \u03ba3 < \u03ba5 < 1 and the scale L. Fixing the total ADM mass fixes the scale.\nFixing further the only other conserved quantities, namely the two angular momenta, leaves a\nsingle free parameter.

This holds independently of the balance\nconditions, and should merely be viewed as a calculational check (see [10]) of our results for\nthe physical parameters.\n2.2.5\n\nCTCs\n\nIt can analytically be shown that there are no closed timelike curves (CTCs) in the plane inside\neach rings. Outside the ring, in the plane of the ring, we have checked numerically near the\nring and found no CTCs. We have also performed numerical checks in the bulk (off the planes\nof the rings), and no CTCs where found. Our checks are not exhaustive, and further progress\nmay require a better coordinate system. We do not expect the solution to have naked CTCs,\nin particular we note that typical signs of CTCs are absent here, for instance the horizon area\nremains positive and well-defined for all admissible parameters.\n\n3\n\nSymmetric bicycles\n\nOur bi-ring solution is described by a single scale and five dimensionless parameters, subject\nto two balance conditions. Thus for fixed ADM mass, there are three independent parameters\nfor the balanced system. Asymptotically, the total angular momenta in the two planes fix two\nof these parameters. Thus the balanced bi-rings have 1-fold continuous non-uniqueness. This\nfreedom corresponds to continuously distributing the total mass between the two black rings.\nA particularly simple subclass of bi-ring solutions is obtained by requiring that the two\nblack rings are identical; i.e. that they have the same temperatures, the same areas, and the\nsame S 1 and S 2 angular velocities. We study this class of solutions in this section.\nPlease note that in this paper we do not review properties of singly spinning black rings\nand their thin and fat ring branches in the phase diagram. This has by now been explained in\nmuch detail in several papers. We refer in particular to [31] and the review [19].\n\n3.1\n\nA model\n\nBefore examining in detail the symmetric bi-ring configuration, it is useful to first model the\nsystem by superimposing two singly spinning rings in orthogonal planes. This of course ignores\nthe interactions between the two rings, the significance of which we soon discover. A similar\nmodel for black saturn was studied in [10].\n12\n\n\f\u03bd = 0.3\n\n\u03bd = 0.5\n\n\u03bd = 0.9\n\n\u03bd = 0.96\n\n\u03bd = 0.99\n\n\u03bd = 0.995\n\nFigure 4: Visualization of the symmetric bicycling black ring system. Shown is the superposition\nof two identical singly p\nspinning rings in orthogonal planes for six different values of the angular\nmomentum j\u03c8 = j\u03c6 = (1 + \u03bd)3 /(8\u03bd) (recall [10] that 0 < \u03bd < 1/2 for the thin ring branch and\n1/2 < \u03bd < 1 on the fat black ring branch). The total mass is fixed to be the same for each plot.\nThe embeddings are plotted on the same scale. Interactions between the two rings are ignored in this\nmodel, but in the real bi-ring solution interactions play an important role.\n\nThe first purpose of the model is to illustrate the geometry of the 2-ring configuration.\nThis is done for six different values of the angular momentum in figure 4. In each case we\nhave plotted, for two identical copies of singly spinning black ring, the isometric embeddings\nof the diametrical cross section of the ring S 2 's, separated by the inner horizon radius. These\nquantities, as well as further details on black ring geometry and isometric embeddings, can be\nfound in [31].\nBlack rings on the thin ring branch have two-spheres which are nearly spherical and largely\nseparated. As the angular momentum decreases so does the inner horizon radius, and the S 2 of\nthe horizon deforms as shown in figure 4. For the singly spinning black ring, the inner radius\ncan become arbitrarily small, and as it goes to zero the solution becomes nakedly singular. In\nthe model the inner horizon radius can also take arbitrarily small values, but this of course\nignores interactions between the two rings.\nThe second purpose of the 2-ring model is to examine what we may encounter in the real\nbi-ring system. We introduce the usual fixed mass dimensionless variables\nr\n27 \u03c0 J 2\n3 3\nAH\n2\nj =\n,\naH =\n(3.1)\n3\n32 G M\n16 \u03c0 (G M)3/2\nfor angular momentum and horizon area. In order to balance itself against collapse, a singly\nspinning black ring must carry a certain amount of angular momentum for the given mass. This\ngives a lower bound on j, namely 27/32 \u2264 j 2 . At j 2 = 27/32, the ring has maximum horizon\narea, aH = 1. The singly spinning ring can rotate\narbitrarily high angular momentum,\n\u221a with\n\u22121\nand as it does so the area goes to zero as aH \u223c ( 2 j) for j \u2192 \u221e.\n13\n\n\fWe normalize the physical parameters for the bi-rings in terms of the total mass. For the\nsymmetric configuration, this is 2M, with M the mass of each ring. The total area is 2AH .\nIn the limit where the rings are large and thin, they have little interaction and we expect the\nmodel to describe the system well. Using (3.1) with 2M as the total \u221a\nmass we find that for the\ntotal\nsymmetric bi-ring model, the total horizon area goes as aH \u223c (4 2 j)\u22121 for large j. This\nbehavior is verified for the bi-ring solution in the next subsection.\nhave maximal area amax\n= 2/23/2 =\nH\n\u221aIgnoring interactions we likewise estimate the2 bi-ring to\n3\n1/ 2 \u2248 0.7 and minimum angular momentum jmin = 1/2 (27/32) \u2248 0.11. We show below that\n2\nthe actual values are amax\n\u2248 0.485 and jmin\n\u2248 0.246 for the bi-ring solution. This indicates that\nH\ninteraction effects are important for black rings near the cusp where the rings in the bi-ring\nsystem are closer to each other.\nA clear sign of interactions in the true bi-ring configuration is that the rotation of the S 1\nof one ring drags the S 2 of the other ring into rotation. We study this in the next subsection.\n\n3.2\n\nThe symmetric bi-ring phase\n\nIn the symmetric bi-ring configuration the two rings are identical: they have the same area and\ntemperature, and the magnitudes of the angular momenta in the two planes of rotation are the\nsame. It is easily verified that this is obtained from a symmetric rod configuration with\n\u03ba5 = 1 \u2212 \u03ba1 ,\n\n\u03ba4 = 1 \u2212 \u03ba2 ,\n\n\u03ba3 =\n\n1\n.\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe two balance conditions (2.32)-(2.33) are also identical, and an equilibrium configuration\nis is therefore obtained by imposing a single condition,\n1=\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba1 )(1 \u2212 \u03ba1 \u2212 \u03ba2 )(1 \u2212 2\u03ba2 )\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba2 )2 (1 \u2212 2\u03ba1 )2\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe parameters must satisfy\n0 < \u03ba1 < \u03ba2 <\n\n1\n,\n2\n\nand this selects one solution \u03ba\u22172 to the balance condition (3.3):\np\n1 + 3\u03ba1 \u2212 6\u03ba21 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2\u03ba1 ) 1 + 2\u03ba1 \u2212 3\u03ba21\n\u2217\n\u03ba2 =\n.\n2(1 + 2\u03ba1 \u2212 4\u03ba21 )\n\n(3.4)\n\n(3.5)\n\nThus the balanced symmetric bi-ring system is parameterized by a single parameter, \u03ba1 . This\nis equivalent to a single balanced black ring which is parameterized by a single parameter.\nFigure 5(a) shows the dimensionless area aH vs. the angular momentum j 2 (as introduced\nin (3.1)) for the symmetric bi-ring system (black curve). As suggested by the model in the\nprevious section, the angular momentum j of the symmetric bi-ring\u221asystem is unbounded from\nabove. When \u03ba1 \u2192 0, j \u2192 \u221e and the area goes to zero as aH \u223c (4 2 j)\u22121 , in exact agreement\nwith the non-interacting model of the previous subsection.

The gray curve shows the Myers-Perry black hole phase and the black curve is the\nsymmetric bi-ring configuration. Both curves have endpoints at j 2 = 1/4. The solutions at the\nendpoints have finite area and zero temperature. (b) Angular velocities vs. inner horizon radius rinner .\nThe solid (dashed) curves corresponds to the angular velocity of the S 2 (S 1 ) of the horizon. The\nminimum inner radius is rm \u2248 0.95.\n\ndescription of the system, since the rings are long and thin, hence far apart and with negligible\ninteractions.\nJust like the singly spinning black ring, there are two branches, a thin and a fat ring branch,\nand they meet at a cusp, where the area reaches its maximum and the angular momentum\n2\nits minimum. At the cusp6 the angular momentum and area take values jmin\n\u2248 0.246 and\naH max \u2248 0.485. The naive estimates of the non-interacting model in the previous subsection\nare different from the actual bi-ring results. We ascribe this to interactions between the two\nrings.\nEach ring carries angular momentum in the plane of its S 1 , and it does not have intrinsic\nangular momentum on the S 2 (the Komar angular momentum integral for the S 2 rotation\nvanishes). The 2-spheres are nonetheless rotating; they have non-vanishing angular velocity\ndue to the interaction between the two rings. Through rotational frame-dragging, the S 1\n(1)\n(2)\nrotation J\u03c8 of ring 1 drags the S 2 of ring 2 to rotate with angular velocity \u03a9\u03c8 . Ring 2 of\ncourse acts symmetrically on ring 1. Claiming that the effect is gravitational frame-dragging\nis of course an interpretation of the physical properties of the solution, but it is very natural.\nThe interpretation of similar dragging effects was tested in detail for the black saturn solution\n[9].\n(1)\n(2)\nFigure 5(b) shows the S 1 angular velocity \u03c9\u03c8 for ring 1 and the S 2 angular velocity \u03c9\u03c8\nfor ring 2 plotted vs. the inner horizon radius rinner of ring 1. (This is done for the symmetric\nbi-ring configuration, so there is really no distinction between parameters for ring 1 and ring\n6\n\nThe cusp is located at \u03ba1 =\n\n1\n6\n\n\u0010\n\u221a \u0001\u22121/3\n\u221a \u00011/3 \u0011\n1 \u2212 24/3 5 + 57\n\u2248 0.293.\n+ 2\u22121/3 5 + 57\n\n15\n\n\f2.) The dimensionless angular velocity is defined as\nr\n8\n\u03a9i (G M)1/2 .\n\u03c9i =\n3\u03c0\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe inner horizon radius is the S 1 radius on the inside rim of the ring.

As shown in figure 5(b) the S 1 angular velocity \u03c9S 1 increases monototically\nas the ring shrinks. As rinner decreases, the S 2 spins faster and faster, reaching a maximum at\nj 2 = 1/4, where \u03c9S 2 = \u03c9S 1 = 1. Oppositely, as the separation between the ring becomes large,\nrinner \u2192 \u221e (j \u2192 \u221e), one finds that \u03c9S 2 \u2192 0. We also note that \u03c9S 2 < \u03c9S 1 . These observations\nare consistent with the interpretation that the S 2 spin is due to gravitational frame-dragging.\nIn figure 5(a) we also display the only other currently known vacuum black hole solution\nin 4+1 dimensions with equal magnitude angular momenta in the two planes of rotation: the\nMyers-Perry black hole with J\u03c8 = J\u03c6 (gray curve in figure 5(a)). A few relevant properties of the\nMyers-Perry black hole are reviewed in appendix\u221aB. At j = 0 this is just the 4+1-dimensional\nSchwarzschild black hole whose area is aH = 2 2. As j increases, the area decreases, and\nthe curve ends at finite area.7 The endpoint solution is a\u221amaximally rotating extremal zero\ntemperature black hole with j 2 \u2261 j\u03c62 = j\u03c82 = 1/4 and aH = 2.\nThe symmetric bi-ring branch in figure 5(a) also has an endpoint at j 2 \u2261 j\u03c62 = j\u03c82 = 1/4, and\nindeed in this limit,8 the temperature goes to zero. It is tempting to interpret the endpoint of\nthe symmetric bi-ring branch as an extremal zero temperature bi-ring configuration. However,\nexamining a similar limit of the doubly spinning black ring in the next section, we are instead\nlead to the conclusion that the j 2 \u2192 1/4 limit of the symmetric bi-ring corresponds to a collapse\nof the rings to the symmetric zero temperature Myers-Perry black hole. In such a collapse, the\nhorizon area will change discontinuously. Thus the j 2 = 1/4 endpoint of the symmetric bi-ring\ncurve in figure 5(a) is not part of the bi-ring phase.\nNaturally one expects the existence of more general bi-ring systems in which each ring\ncarries intrinsic angular momentum in both planes of rotation. Such solutions will extend the\nclass of symmetric bi-rings, and their phases must also be considered for the full structure of\nthe phase diagram figure 5(a). Placing a black hole at the center of such a generalized bi-ring\nsystem will give rise to an even larger class of solutions, including symmetric ones. Further\ndiscussion of generalizations follows in section 6.\n7\n\nContrary to the singly spinning Myers-Perry black hole which ends at j = 1 and aH = 0, where it is singular.\nThe limit is \u03ba1 \u2192 1/2, corresponding to a collapse of all the finite length rods in the phase diagram. Due to\nthe balance condition, this particular scaling limit results in a non-trivial solution. The extremal limits of the\nKerr black hole and the 4+1d Myers-Perry black hole also correspond to a controlled collapses of the horizon\nrods. This seems to be a general feature of zero temperature black holes.\n8\n\n16\n\n\f4\n\nDoubly spinning black rings\n\nThe solution for the balanced doubly spinning black ring was presented by Pomeransky and\nSen'kov [18]. We provide here an analysis of the doubly spinning ring solution and its physical\nproperties.\n\n4.1\n\nAnalysis\n\nWe use the solution9 in the form presented in [18] except that we interchange \u03c6 and \u03c8, so that\n\u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of the S 2 and \u03c8 parameterizes the circle of the ring.\nThe solution [18] is given in ring coordinates (x, y) with |x| \u2264 1 and y \u2264 \u22121, and is\nparametrized by a scale k and two dimensionless parameters \u03bb and \u03bd which are required to\nsatisfy\n\u221a\n0 \u2264 \u03bd < 1,\n2 \u03bd \u2264\u03bb < 1+\u03bd.\n(4.1)\nThe balanced black ring [11] with rotation only in the plane of the ring is found in the limit\n\u03bd \u2192 0. The unbalanced black ring with angular momentum only on the S 2 [14, 15, 16] cannot\nbe obtained from the Pomeransky-Sen'kov solution because the balance condition is imposed in\nthe solution presented in [18]. Likewise it is not possible to obtain the full general 5-dimensional\nMyers-Perry black hole as a \"collapse\" limit of the balanced ring solution. The more general\nunbalanced doubly spinning black ring metric of Morisawa et al [20] contains these limits.\nAsymptotics:\nAsymptotic coordinates (\u03c1, \u03b8) are introduced through the coordinate transformation\nr\n1+\u03bd\u2212\u03bb\n2\n2 2 1\n2\n2 2 1\ny = \u22121 \u2212 4k \u03b1 sin \u03b8 ,\n\u03b1=\n.\nx = \u22121 + 4k \u03b1 cos \u03b8 ,\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn the \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e limit this brings the metric of [18] to a manifestly flat form with the angular\ncoordinates \u03c6, \u03c8 and the time coordinate t canonically normalized.\nHorizon:\nThe roots of the equation\n1 + \u03bb y + \u03bd y2 = 0\ndetermine the locations of the inner and outer horizons; the event horizon is located at\n\u221a\n\u2212\u03bb + \u03bb2 \u2212 4\u03bd\nyh =\n.\n2\u03bd\n9\n\n(4.3)\n\n(4.4)\n\nWe have analytically verified that the solution presented in [18] indeed satisfies the Einstein vacuum equations, R\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\n17\n\n\fThe metric has a coordinate singularity at the roots of (4.3) where gyy diverges. Good\ncoordinates through the event horizon can be constructed by setting \u0233 = y \u2212 yh and performing\nthe coordinate transformation\nA\nB\nC\nd\u03c6\u0304 = d\u03c6 \u2212 d\u0233 ,\nd\u03c8\u0304 = d\u03c8 \u2212 d\u0233 ,\ndt\u0304 = dt \u2212 d\u0233 .\n(4.5)\n\u0233\n\u0233\n\u0233\nThe constants A, B, and C are determined by eliminating potential divergences in the metric\ncomponents in the limit \u0233 \u2192 0. In more detail: the constants A, C are fixed in terms of B (and\n\u03bb, \u03bd) by requiring the absence of a 1/\u0233 divergence in gt\u0233 . This also eliminates similar potential\ndivergences in g\u03c6\u0233 and g\u03c8\u0233 . Next B can be chosen such that the divergences in g\u0233\u0233 cancel. In\nthe coordinates (t\u0304, \u03c6\u0304, \u03c8\u0304, x, \u0233), the metric is then analytic across \u0233 = 0, and y = yh is therefore\n1/2\nthe location of a regular event horizon. The analysis is valid\n\u221a for 2\u03bd < \u03bb < 1 + \u03bd.\nAn extremal rotating black ring is obtained for \u03bb = 2 \u03bd, when the inner and outer horizons\ncoincide (i.e. the roots of (4.3) coincide). Good coordinates through the horizon can also be\nfound in this case, but it requires a separate analysis where terms 1/\u0233 and 1/\u0233 2 are both\nincluded in the coordinate transformations (4.5).\nPhysical parameters:\nThe ADM mass and angular momenta are\nq \u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bd (1 + \u03bd)2 \u2212 \u03bb2\n\u03bb\n3\u03c0 k\n4\u03c0 k\n\u03bb\nM =\n,\nJ\u03c6 =\n,\nG 1+\u03bd\u2212\u03bb\nG (1 + \u03bd \u2212 \u03bb)(1 \u2212 \u03bd)2\np\n2\u03c0 k 3 \u03bb (1 + \u03bb \u2212 6\u03bd + \u03bd \u03bb + \u03bd 2 ) (1 + \u03bd)2 \u2212 \u03bb2\n.\nJ\u03c8 =\nG\n(1 + \u03bd \u2212 \u03bb)2 (1 \u2212 \u03bd)2\n2\n\n3\n\nThe angular velocities are\nr\n1 1+\u03bd \u2212\u03bb\n\u03a9\u03c8 =\n,\n2k 1 + \u03bd + \u03bb\n\n\u03a9\u03c6\n\n(4.6)\n(4.7)\n\nr\n\u221a\n\u03bb(1 + \u03bd) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bd) \u03bb2 \u2212 4\u03bd 1 + \u03bd \u2212 \u03bb\n\u221a\n=\n,\n4k \u03bb \u03bd\n1+\u03bd +\u03bb\n\n(4.8)\n\n32\u03c0 2 k 3 \u03bb(1 + \u03bd + \u03bb)\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03bd)2 (yh\u22121 \u2212 yh )\n\n(4.9)\n\nand the horizon area can be written\nAH =\n\nThe temperature can be found using the Smarr formula 32 M = TH S + J\u03c6 \u03a9\u03c6 + \u03a9\u03c8 J\u03c8 , with\nS = AH /(4G), and the result is\n\u221a\n(yh\u22121 \u2212 yh )(1 \u2212 \u03bd) \u03bb2 \u2212 4\u03bd\nTH =\n.\n(4.10)\n8\u03c0 k \u03bb(1 + \u03bd + \u03bb)\n\u221a\nAs expected, TH = 0 for the extremal solution with \u03bb = 2 \u03bd.\nExamining the ranges of the dimensionless angular momenta (defined in (3.1)) one finds\n3\n1\nj\u03c8 \u2265 ,\n(4.11)\nj\u03c6 \u2264 ,\n4\n4\nIn particular the angular momenta can never be equal, and the ratio j\u03c6 /j\u03c8 is less than or equal\nto 1/3.

The\nanswers are summarized in the phase diagrams in figure 6. There are several curves of interest\nin the phase diagram, and we shall discuss them in turn.\nThe extremal black ring limit \u03bb \u2192 2\u03bd 1/2\nThe extremal black ring with \u03bb = 2\u03bd 1/2 is regular and has zero temperature. Physically it\ncorresponds to the S 2 rotating maximally, i.e. saturating the Kerr bound. In this limit, the\nangular momentum j\u03c8 and the area aH can be written directly as functions of j\u03c6 :\nj\u03c8 =\n\n1 + 8j\u03c62\n,\n8j\u03c6\n\n\u221a\naH = 2 2 j\u03c6 .\n\n(4.12)\n\nIn figure 6 this extremal\nphase is shown as the solid black curve. It starts at j\u03c8 = 3/4,\n\u221a\nj\u03c6 = 1/4 and aH = 1/ 2, and the area decreases monotonically to zero as j\u03c8 \u2192 \u221e (j\u03c6 \u2192 0).\nWe conclude that there exists zero temperature black rings for any S 1 angular momentum\nj\u03c8 > 3/4.\n\u221a\nIn the extremal ring limit, \u03bb = 2 \u03bd, the inner and outer horizon radii are the same r (inner) =\nr (out) . This is similar to the case of supersymmetric black rings [32, 33, 34, 21].\nThe second extremal limit \u03bd \u2192 1, \u03bb \u2192 2 is a collapse\nA second extremal limit corresponds to the limit \u03bd \u2192 1. Due to the parameter restrictions\n(4.1), we have to take \u03bb \u2192 2 as \u03bd \u2192 1. This must be done in a way that leaves dimensionless\nparameters finite, and that requires the ratio\n\u03c3=\n\n1+\u03bd\u2212\u03bb\n(1 \u2212 \u03bd)2\n\n(4.13)\n\nto be finite in the limit. Solving this equation for \u03bb and taking the limit \u03bd \u2192 1\u2212 gives\n\u221a\n4 2 \u03c3 3/2\n\u221a\nTH = 0 ,\nj\u03c6 = \u03c3 ,\nj\u03c8 = 1 \u2212 \u03c3 ,\naH =\n,\n\u03c9\u03c8,\u03c6 \u2192 1 .\n(4.14)\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 4\u03c3\nThe (j\u03c82 , aH ) curve is shown in figure 6 (dashed curve). As we now show, this curve does not\nrepresent a phase of extremal rings.\nThe limit \u03bd \u2192 1, \u03bb \u2192 2 appears singular, but this is just a coordinate artifact, and the\nresulting solution is actually the extremal Myers-Perry black hole with parameters a1 , a2 and\n\u03bc1/2 = a1 + a2 .

The dark gray curve shows the phase of the singly spinning black ring. The light gray curves are\n1\n1\n1 1 1 1\nbranches of constant j\u03c6 ; the particular values shown are (right towards left) j\u03c62 = 500\n, 100\n, 50\n, 35 , 25 , 18 .\n1\n2\n2\nAs j\u03c6 \u2192 16 , its maximum value, the constant-j\u03c6 curves degenerate to the point j\u03c8 = 9/16 and\n\u221a\naH = 1/ 2. Each of the light gray constant-j\u03c6 curves start at the zero-temperature branch of doubly\nspinning black ring solutions, shown as the solid black curve, and they limit to the black dashed curve\n(see main text). The black dotted curve outlines the position of the cusp of the constant-j\u03c6 curves;\nthese are characterized by having minimum j\u03c8 and maximum area for given fixed j\u03c6 . The plot on the\nright shows the same set of curves overlaying a scatter plot (lighest gray - 10,000 points) indicating\nthe range in the phase diagram covered by doubly spinning black rings. The region is bounded by the\ncurves we have described.\n\nand perform the following coordinate transformation\n\u221a\n\u221a\n16 a2 k 3 sin2 \u03b8\n16 a2 k 3 cos2 \u03b8\n,\ny = \u22121 \u2212\n.\nx = \u22121 +\n(a1 + a2 )3/2 (r 2 \u2212 a1 a2 )\n(a1 + a2 )3/2 (r 2 \u2212 a1 a2 )\n\n(4.16)\n\nWhen \u03bd \u2192 1 one finds the metric for the extremal Myers-Perry solution.\nIn this collapse limit of the ring to an extremal Myers-Perry black hole, the area is discontinuous, just like in the similar collapse limits of supersymmetric black rings [33]. So the dashed\ncurve in figure 6 does not itself represent a phase of black rings, but it marks the endpoint of\nthe fixed-j\u03c6 phases which are described below; at the endpoint the ring has collapsed to the\nzero temperature Myers-Perry black hole.10\nCurves of constant S 2 angular momentum\nThe dimensionless angular momentum on the S 2 is given by\nj\u03c62 =\n\n\u03bd(1 + \u03bd \u2212 \u03bb)2 (1 + \u03bd + \u03bb)\n.\n2\u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03bd)4\n\n10\n\n(4.17)\n\nWe had examined the inner and other horizon radii and observed that they remain finite in the limit\n\u03bd \u2192 1, \u03bb \u2192 2. This may seem to contradict the collapse of the ring, but one must keep in mind that these radii\nare defined by the horizon geometry which is discontinuous in the limit.\n\n20\n\n\fFinding the fixed-j\u03c6 curves in the phase diagram can be done by solving j\u03c6 = j\u03c6\u2217 for some fixed\nvalue 0 \u2264 j\u03c6\u2217 \u2264 1/4. It is a cubic equation in \u03bb which for 0 < \u03bd < 1 and 0 < j\u03c6 < 1/4 has three\nreal roots. Two of these roots always violate the constraints (4.1), but the third root satisfies\n(4.1) provided \u03bd > \u03bdc (j\u03c6\u2217 ), where \u03bdc (j\u03c6\u2217 ) is some critical value which depends on the value j\u03c6\u2217 .\n1\n1\n1 1 1\n1\n, 100\n, 50\n, 35\n, 25 , 18 . For small j\u03c6 the\nFigure 6 shows (in light gray) curves of fixed j\u03c62 = 500\ncurve is very similar to the singly spinning black ring with j\u03c6 = 0, shown in dark gray. The\nfixed-j\u03c6 curves have two endpoints at non-vanishing area aH . One corresponds to the limit\n\u03bd \u2192 \u03bdc (j\u03c6\u2217 ) which is equivalent to \u03bb \u2192 2\u03bd 1/2 ; this is the zero temperature extremal branch\n(solid black curve). The other endpoint of the fixed-j\u03c6 curves is at \u03bd \u2192 1, and as shown above\nthe ring collapses to an extremal Myers-Perry black hole in this limit.\nWhen j\u03c6 < 1/5 the fixed j\u03c6 -curves have two branches: a thin and a fat ring branch, just\nlike the singly spinning black ring. When 1/5 \u2264 j\u03c6 \u2264 1/4 only the thin ring branch exists.\nCurve of cusps\nThe dotted black curve in figure 6 are the position of the cusp of the constant j\u03c6 curve, where j\u03c8\nis minimized and the area maximized. The cusp curve is found by using a Lagrange multiplier\nto fix j\u03c6 while extremizing j\u03c8 . This fixes \u03bb in terms of \u03bd as\n\u0011\np\n1\u0010\n\u2212 1 \u2212 \u03bd + (9 + \u03bd)(1 + 9\u03bd) .\n\u03bb=\n4\n\n(4.18)\n\nThe cusp only exists forpsufficiently small j\u03c6 , namely j\u03c6 < 1/5. The fixed j\u03c6 = 1/5 curve ends\n\u221a\nat j\u03c8 = 4/5 and aH = 25 3 + 5, where the dotted curve of cusps ends on the dashed curve.\n\n4.3\n\nPhysics discussion\n\nOne feature of the curves of fixed angular momentum j\u03c6 on the S 2 is that the S 1 angular\nmomentum cannot be arbitrarily large. This is easily understood. Recall that in the limit of\nlarge j\u03c8 , the singly rotating black ring becomes large and thin. Non-zero j\u03c6 means that the S 2\npart of the ring behaves like a Kerr black hole, in particular it will have to obey the Kerr bound\non the angular momentum. This implies that for given non-vanishing j\u03c6 , the size of the S 2\ncannot become arbitrarily thin (the effective S 2 mass cannot be too small because that would\nviolate the Kerr bound). This in turn means that one cannot spin up the ring to arbitrarily\nlarge j\u03c8 . Hence for given j\u03c6 , there is a maximum possible value for j\u03c8 . When j\u03c6 is small, the\nmaximum value is large, but decreases as j\u03c6 increases, as is seen in figure 6.\nAnother qualitative feature is the disappearance of the \"fat ring branch\" as j\u03c6 becomes\nlarge. Consider two diagonally opposite 2-spheres of the ring. They both carry j\u03c6 angular\nmomentum which creates an attractive spin-spin interaction [35]. As the (inner) S 1 decreases,\nthe strength of this spin-spin attraction grows stronger, and it becomes harder to balance the\nring by angular momentum on the S 1 . This is what causes the diminishing of the fat ring\nbranch as j\u03c6 increases, and for j\u03c6 \u2265 1/5, the fat branch disappears.11\n11\n\nWe are grateful to R. Emparan for discussions of these properties.\n\n21\n\n\fThe analysis of [31] suggested that the thin black ring branch solutions are stable to radial\nperturbations and the fat rings unstable. This was in concordance with an expected result [36]\nthat at least one extra mode of instability appeared when going across the cusp from the thin\nblack ring branch to the fat black ring branch. Extrapolating these results, doubly spinning\nrings with large enough S 2 angular momentum, j\u03c6 \u2265 1/5, may be expected to be radially\nstable.\n\n5\n\nZero-temperature bicycles\n\nWe found in section 3 that the symmetric bi-ring system had a zero-temperature limit. In the\nprevious section we investigated a similar zero temperature limit of the doubly spinning black\nring, and showed that it corresponded to the collapse of the ring to an extremal Myers-Perry\nblack hole. In this section we take a scaling limit to find a similar collapse zero-temperature\nlimit of the bi-ring solution.\nFor the symmetric bi-rings the limit of zero temperature is \u03ba1 , \u03ba2 \u2192 \u03ba3 = 1/2. It is\ntherefore natural to take the limit \u03bai \u2192 \u03ba for some 0 < \u03ba < 1 for the bi-ring solution. This\nlimit corresponds to collapsing all the finite rods in the rod diagram to zero length.\nHere we want to take a limit such that T1 , T2 \u2192 0, but the mass, angular momenta, angular\nvelocities, and horizon areas remain finite. The simplest approach is to first take the limit\n\u03bai \u2192 \u03ba and then impose the balance conditions, so we also need the RHS of the balance\nconditions (2.32)-(2.33) to be finite in the limit. Without loss of generality we pick \u03ba = \u03ba1 , and\nthe desired scaling limit is then obtained by setting\n\u03ba2 = \u03ba1 + w1 \u01eb ,\n\n\u03ba3 = \u03ba1 + w2 \u01eb ,\n\n\u03ba4 = \u03ba1 + w3 \u01eb ,\n\n\u03ba5 = \u03ba1 + \u01eb ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nand taking \u01eb \u2192 0. (By exploiting the freedom of rescaling \u01eb, we have set the coefficient of \u01eb in\n\u03ba5 equal to 1.) The ordering of the \u03bai implies\n0 < w1 < w2 < w3 < 1 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nThe balance conditions become\n1 =\n\nw3 (1 \u2212 w1 )(w2 \u2212 w1 )(w3 \u2212 w1 )\n,\nw22 (1 \u2212 \u03ba1 )\n\n1 =\n\nw3 (1 \u2212 w1 )(w3 \u2212 w1 )(w3 \u2212 w2 )\n. (5.3)\n(1 \u2212 w2 )2 \u03ba1\n\nOne finds that as \u01eb \u2192 0, the temperatures go to zero linearly in \u01eb, so the ratio of the temperatures is finite in the limit,\ns\n\u0012 \u0013\n(1 \u2212 w1 )(1 \u2212 w3 )\nT1\nw2\n\u03be = lim\n=\n.\n(5.4)\n\u01eb\u21920\nT2\n(1 \u2212 w2 )\nw1 w3\nThis ratio can take any non-negative value, and the limit T1 , T2 \u2192 0 can therefore be taken\nalong any subfamily of solutions with T1 = \u03be T2 for any value of \u03be.\n\n22\n\n\fIn the scaling limit we find (superscript \"(0)\" indicates zero temperature)\n\u03c0 L3\n\u03c0 L3\n(0)\n= \u221a\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba1 ) ,\nJ\u03c8 = \u221a\n\u03ba1 .\n(5.5)\n2G\n2G\nNote that the relationship between the mass-fixed angular momenta are exactly the same as\nfor the extremal Myers-Perry black hole. We therefore expect the limit to be a collapse of the\ntwo orthogonal rings to a single extremal Myers-Perry black hole, just as in the \u03bd \u2192 1, \u03bb \u2192 2\nlimit of the doubly spinning black ring. Again, the horizon areas will be discontinuous in this\nlimit, so the corresponding limiting curves in the phase diagram do not correspond to physical\nblack hole phases.\nEven if the zero temperature limit of the bi-ring solution presented in this paper turns out to\nsimply give the extremal Myers-Perry black hole, we do expect there to exist zero temperature\nbi-ring system. These are obtained from a more general bi-ring system, constructed from two\nrings which each carry intrinsic angular momenta on \u221a\nboth S 1 and S 2 . For this more general\nbi-ring the limit of extremality is similar to the \u03bb \u2192 2 \u03bd limit of each of the doubly spinning\nblack rings of the system. We expect those extremal solutions to have arbitrarily large angular\nmomenta in both planes. In the next section we discuss the zero temperature phase diagram.\nM (0) =\n\n6\n\n3\u03c0 L2\n,\n4G\n\n(0)\n\nJ\u03c6\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we have analyzed two 4+1-dimensional asymptotically flat black hole vacuum solutions: one is the doubly spinning black ring, the other is the bicycling black rings, the bi-rings,\nconsisting of two black rings balanced in orthogonal planes. Both solutions are constructed by\nthe inverse scattering method. The doubly spinning black ring was found by Pomeransky and\nSen'kov [18], and the bi-ring solution constructed here is new.\nWe showed in section 4 that the doubly\n\u221a spinning black ring had two limits of zero temperature. The first of these limits, \u03bb \u2192 2 \u03bd, gives a zero-temperature extremal doubly rotating\nblack ring. We have proven that good coordinates exist across the horizon, so indeed the\nsolution is regular everywhere on and outside the horizon. This branch of zero temperature\nvacuum solution shares certain features with supersymmetric black rings, for instance that the\ninner and outer horizon radii are the same. However, there are also clear differences, for example that the extremal non-supersymmetric rings have non-vanishing angular velocities, while\n\u03a9 = 0 for asymptotically flat supersymmetric black holes. This difference is significant for\nstudying dragging in the system. Remarkably, Reall has shown [37] that the entropy of this\nnon-supersymmetric extremal black ring can be reproduced from a microscopic calculation.\nIn the other extremal limit (\u03bd \u2192 1,\u03bb \u2192 2) of the doubly spinning ring, we have shown that\nthe ring collapses to a zero-temperature Myers-Perry black hole.\nFigure 7 shows the known phases of zero temperature single horizon vacuum black holes:\nthe zero temperature Myers-Perry black hole and the extremal limit of the doubly spinning\nblack ring. The two phase diagrams, (a) and (b), shown in figure 7 are equivalent. In figure\n(a) we use the S 1 angular momentum j\u03c8 of the ring as the \"order parameter\" on the horizontal\naxis, and in figure (b) it is the S 2 angular momentum. There is no non-uniqueness in the phase\ndiagram in figure 7, because the two solutions never co-exist with the same j\u03c8 and j\u03c6 .\n23\n\n\f\u221a\n2\n\naH\n\n\u221a\n\nMP black hole\n\naH\n2\nMP black hole\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\ndoubly spinning\nblack ring\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\ndoubly spinning\nblack ring\n\nj\u03c8\n\n(a)\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\nj\u03c6\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7: Phase diagram for zero temperature single horizon black holes. In figure (a) we choose\nthe S 1 angular momentum of the doubly spinning ring on the horizontal axis, in figure (b) it is the\nS 2 angular momentum. The gray curve is the zero temperature Myers-Perry black hole. Its entropy\nis maximized when the system is symmetric, i.e. when j\u03c8 = j\u03c6 = 1/2. The solid black curve is the\n1/2 of the doubly spinning black ring. It reaches maximum area\nregular zero\n\u221a temperature limit \u03bb \u2192 2\u03bd\naH = 1/ 2 for maximal j\u03c6 = 1/4 and minimal j\u03c8 = 3/4.\n\nIn addition to the single horizon phases shown in figure 7 there will exist other zero temperature phases for 4+1-dimensional vacuum black holes. These include extremal bi-rings and\nextremal saturn solutions. The bi-rings we have constructed in this paper are a subclass of a\nmore general family of bi-ring solutions. Recall that our bi-rings are essentially superpositions\nof singly spinning black rings. Obviously one can construct more general solutions by superimposing the doubly spinning black rings. This would presumably require using a two-step\nsolution generating procedure with the second step involving a non-diagonal seed, as in [18].\nWhen the S 2 's of the generalized bi-ring system carry maximal spin, one expects to have a\nzero temperature bi-ring configuration consisting of two doubly spinning extremal black rings.\nThe general bi-ring system is expected to have a 3-fold continuous non-uniqueness corresponding\nto the freedom of distributing the mass and the two angular momenta between the two black\nobjects while keeping the total asymptotic ADM mass and angular momenta fixed and imposing\nbalance. Requiring zero temperature for each ring gives two constraints, and the degeneracy\nreduces to 1-fold continuous non-uniqueness for the extremal bi-rings. Thus these solutions will\nfill up a 2d area of the phase diagram.\nAnd even more non-uniqueness can be expected. Figure 8 shows our expectations for the\nfull phase diagram of extremal doubly rotating 4+1-dimensional asymptotically flat vacuum\nblack holes. The curves are the single horizon solutions shown also in figure 7(a). The gray\nstrip covers the phase diagram from j = 0 to arbitrarily large j. The total area is bounded\nby the maximum of the zero\n\u221a temperature Myers-Perry black hole, so that the gray strip covers\nj \u2265 0 and 0 < atotal\n<\n2. The proposal is that there exist zero temperature black hole\nH\nsolutions at any point of the gray strip.\nThe analysis behind this is similar to the one done for the phase diagram of the nonextremal singly spinning black holes in [10]. One way to justify that the whole strip in the\nphase diagram is covered by solutions is to consider the system of a zero temperature Myers24\n\n\f\u221a\n2\n\natotal\nH\nMP black hole\n\n1\n\u221a1\n2\n\ndoubly spinning\nblack ring\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\nj\u03c8\n1\n\n1.5\n\nFigure 8: Expected phase diagram for zero temperature extremal 4+1-dimensional asymptotically\nflat vacuum black holes.

In addition, generalized extremal bi-ring solutions will\nprovide further non-uniqueness in the system.\n\nPerry black hole surrounded by a zero temperature doubly spinning black ring; this is the\nnatural zero temperature\nblack saturn solution. One can get arbitrarily close to the upper\n\u221a\ntotal\nbound aH = 2 by putting most of the mass in the Myers-Perry black hole, and tuning its\nangular momentum to maximize its entropy. The total angular momentum in one plane of\nrotation can then be adjusted to be any value 0 \u2264 j < \u221e by including a thin zero temperature\nblack ring around the black hole. The angular momentum in the orthogonal plane can likewise\nbe adjusted to any value by including a second black ring, thus combining the bi-rings and\nblack saturn into a black bi-ring saturn.12\nWe expect that any balanced zero temperature black hole configuration in 4+1-dimensional\nvacuum gravity, with\n\u221a asymptotically flat boundary conditions, have total dimensionless area\ntotal\nbounded by aH = 2, which is the maximal area of the zero temperature Myers-Perry black\nhole. It is achieved for j\u03c8 = j\u03c6 . For comparison, it was argued\u221ain [10] that non-extremal black\nhole configurations exist of any j and any total area atotal\n\u2264 2 2. The inequality is saturated\nH\nonly for the static 4+1-dimensional Schwarzschild solution.\nThe continuous non-uniqueness in the general non-extremal black hole phase diagram can be\narbitrarily large. A system consisting of n concentric doubly spinning black rings distributed at\nwill in the two orthogonal planes and surrounding a central doubly spinning black hole will have\n3n-fold continuous non-uniqueness. There are only 3 conserved quantities, the ADM mass and\ntwo angular momenta, but these can be distributed continuously (at least classically) between\nthe n + 1 objects (subject to balance conditions). In addition to this, there can be discrete\nnon-uniqueness. Imposing thermodynamic equilibrium, equal temperatures and equal angular\nvelocities, is expected to fix the radius of the rings, so the most general equilibrium system\nwould be the bi-ring saturn discussed above.\nHigher dimensional gravity has proven to contain an intriguing richness of black hole solutions. We are privileged to be able to access some of them as exact solutions. Although these\n12\n\nHaving arbitrarily large angular momentum relies on the space being infinite since the ring needs to be\nlarge. So if the system is put in a box, the phase structure would necessarily change.\n\n25\n\n\fare in some cases rather involved solutions, like black saturn and the bi-rings, it is possible\nto extract interesting physics. In general, we cannot expect to be lucky to have exact solutions for all interesting black hole configurations, and other methods for constructing solutions\nare needed. Recently the matched asymptotic expansion method was used to construct large\nradius higher dimensional black rings [38]. From these solutions interesting properties of the\nphase diagram of black holes were extracted and the remaining structure of the phase diagram\nconjectured. Just like black saturn had a place in that phase diagram, so will doubly spinning\nblack rings, bi-rings and bi-ring saturns in the generalization to involve spin in both planes of\nrotation.\nIn this paper we have examined extremal limits of exact black hole solutions. A common\npicture seems to be that if a rod diagram description of the solution can be given, then the\nzero temperature extremal limit is a scaling limit in which the finite length rods shrink to zero\nsize. This characterization may lead to simplifications for constructing extremal black hole\nconfigurations; it would be interesting and useful if it could be implemented directly in the\ninverse scattering method.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Roberto Emparan for very useful discussions and for collaboration during\nthe early stages of this work.

This behaviour changes as\nthe angular momentum in the orthogonal plane is turned on. An extremal non-zero minimum\nof the horizon area is then reached at maximum momentum. This is shown in figure 9. The\nendpoints of the fixed-j\u03c6 curves all have zero temperature. The phase of extremal Myers-Perry\nblack holes is shown as the gray curve in figure 9. It is obtained by saturating the bound (B.3),\nwhich implies that the inner and outer horizons coincide, so that the solution is extremal and\nhas zero temperature.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
