We derive the information capacity of a scheme\nbased on the spatial entanglement of photons from a realistic source, and show that the standard\nmeasures of security known for quadrature-based continuous variable quantum cryptography (CVQKD) are inadequate. A specific simple eavesdropping attack is analysed to illuminate how secret\ninformation may be distilled well beyond the bounds of the usual CV-QKD measures.\nPACS numbers:\n\nThe distribution of secret information via optical channels, e.g. quantum key distribution (QKD), provides\nan important example of the technological capability of\nquantum correlations. The QKD protocol proposed by\nBennett and Brassard [1] and its large collection of variations [2], including QKDs using nonorthogonal states [3]\nand entangled photons [4], employ single photons or photon pairs to ensure secure information transfer between\nthe source (Alice) and receiver (Bob). The quantum\ninformation associated with the single-photon states in\nthese schemes is encoded as dichotomic variables, e.g. in\nthe polarization or relative phases of single-photon superposition states [5]. Thus the maximum achievable\ninformation transfer rate is intrinsically limited to one\nbit per photon. A newer development of QKD utilizes\ncontinuous variable (CV) multi-photon systems [6, 7, 8]\nwhere the amplitude and phase quadratures of coherent\nstates [9, 10] or squeezed states [11, 12] serve as the information carriers. CV-QKD systems potentially enable\nhigher key distribution rate. Recently, single-photon CVQKD employing the position and momentum observables\nhas been suggested as a means to increase the information transfer rate by coding more than one bit per photon. Compared to quadrature-based CV-QKD, singlephoton CV-QKD eliminates the local oscillators required\nfor homodyne detection and, as we will show, decouples\nthe channel loss from the quantum correlations. Experimental implementations have demonstrated the feasibility of these schemes by utilizing the spatial freedom of\nsingle photons [13] or entangled photon pairs generated\nby parametric down-conversion (PDC) [14, 15]. Yet, the\nsecurity of such schemes has not been analysed, and as we\nshow here, this is not a trivial extension of either BB84\nor the conventional CV-QKD security proofs.\nIn this Letter, we evaluate the potential of the spatial\nproperties of PDC for QKD by considering a realistic\nPDC source as well as practical detectors and a lossy\nquantum channel. The analysis here also works for CVQKD employing the correlations of time-frequency entangled photon pairs [16]. Spatial correlations are, however, easier to manipulate with current technology, allowing more complete assessments of the channel secu-\n\nrity. In our analysis we derive the mutual information\nof the communicating parties from measurable postionmomentum correlations of PDC states and bound the\ninformation of a potential eavesdropper (Eve) by analyzing detected photocount statistics. Our results lie in\nthe region between conventional dichotomic and continuous variable QKD and highlight the differences between\nthese alternative approaches in terms of the experimental imperfections corrupting the secrecy of the key exchange. Our security analysis, which is mainly based\non an intercept-resend eavesdropping strategy, indicates\nthat single-photon CV-QKD gives increased secure bit\nrates per photon for intermediate channel losses.\nDuring the process of PDC, the pump photon with\nwave vector kp spontaneously splits into two lower frequency (signal and idler) photons with wave vectors ks\nand ki . The spatial and spectral properties of the photon\npair are correlated by the material dispersion. In what\nfollows it is assumed that the state is spectrally filtered\nsuch that the frequencies of signal and idler photons are\nrestricted to \u03c9s0 = \u03c9i0 = \u03c9p /2. The resulting two-photon\nstate is\nZZ\n|\u03a8i \u2248 |vaci + \u03bc\ndks\u22a5 dki\u22a5 f (ks\u22a5 ; ki\u22a5 ) ks\u22a5 ; ki\u22a5 . (1)\nFor the practical PDC source, the down-converted modes\nare usually close to the longitudinal axis with the transverse vectors |ks\u22a5 | \u226a ks and |ki\u22a5 | \u226a ki (ks/i = |ks/i |).\nFor a pump beam with a Gaussian profile the biphoton\namplitude f (ks\u22a5 ; ki\u22a5 ) can be approximated by\nf (ks\u22a5 ; ki\u22a5 ) = \u03b1(ks\u22a5 + ki\u22a5 )\u03c6L (ks\u22a5 \u2212 ki\u22a5 )\n\u0015\n\u0014\nw2\n2 exp (i\u2206kz L) \u2212 1\n,\n= C exp \u2212 0 ks\u22a5 + ki\u22a5\n4\ni\u2206kz L\nwith \u2206kz \u2248 2K \u2212 kp \u2212\n\nks\u22a5 \u2212 ki\u22a5\n4K\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\nand where \u03b1(ks\u22a5 + ki\u22a5 ) originates from the pump envelope and transverse phase-matching function, while\n\u03c6L (ks\u22a5 \u2212ki\u22a5 ) is the longitudinal phase-matching function.\nC is the constant for normalization, K = ks = ki , w0 is\nthe beam waist of the pump and L denotes the length of\n\n\f2\nthe nonlinear crystal in z direction [17]. Retaining the\nlongitutional phasematching function \u03c6L (ks\u22a5 \u2212ki\u22a5 ) is critical to bounding the shared information from above [19].\nThe joint probability distribution of ks\u22a5 and ki\u22a5 is given\nby p(ks\u22a5 ; ki\u22a5 ) = |f (ks\u22a5 ; ki\u22a5 )|2 . The mutual information\nbetween ks\u22a5 and ki\u22a5 can be calculated from [20]\nI(ks\u22a5 ; ki\u22a5 ) = H(ki\u22a5 ) \u2212 H(ki\u22a5 | ks\u22a5 ).\n\n(3)\n\nwhere H(ki\u22a5 ) and H(ki\u22a5 | ks\u22a5 ) denote the entropy and\nconditional entropy respectively. Similarly, the Fourier\ntransform of Eq. (2) determines the mutual information\nI(rs\u22a5 ; ri\u22a5 ) between the transverse positions of the two\nphotons. We model our practical source of entangled\nphoton pairs by considering degenerate Type-I PDC in a\nBBO crystal with a phase-matching angle of 3\u25e6 , pumped\nat 400nm. Fig. 1 shows the calculated maximum mutual\ninformation that Alice and Bob can extract if they adopt\na symmetric coding, i.e. they measure with equal probabilities the position and momentum of the photons. The\ngraph illustrates the information transfer gain for CV\nsingle-photon systems. This should be compared with\nbinary coding, for which a maximal value of one is obtained. For a fixed pump power, the amount of shared\ninformation between PDC photons may be increased by\nincreasing the pump waist w0 and decreasing the crystal\nlength L, though the penalty is a reduced efficiency of\nphoton-pair generation, resulting in low signal rates. The\nentanglement of the two-photon state in our analysis can\nbe characterized by considering the correlations or the\nmutual information for direct measurements of a pair of\nconjugate continuous variables, namely the position and\nmomentum of the photons. Alternatively, one may quantify the entanglement contained in this degree of freedom\nby decomposing the state into its Schmidt modes [21],\nand evaluating the corresponding concurrence. We verified that this approach yields the same asymptotic behavior, which confirms the consistency of our results with\nmore general entanglement measures. QKD further requires that the measurements of non-corresponding variables do not exhibit correlations; our calculations show\nthat the mutual information between momentum and position (I(ks\u22a5 ; ri\u22a5 ) and I(rs\u22a5 ; ki\u22a5 )) is negligible.\nTo analyse the security of a single-photon CV-QKD\nsystem we choose a specific protocol. Pairs of entangled\nphotons are generated in the nonlinear crystal and transmitted to Alice and Bob separately via a quantum channel. The two parties choose randomly to detect either the\nposition (r \u22a5 ) or momentum (k\u22a5 ) of each photon they\nreceive. Then Alice and Bob announce by an authenticated public channel the variables which they measured\nfor each photon and drop the bits where they used different variables; the remaining bits constitute the sifted\nraw key. To accomplish a successful quantum key distribution, the system must allow Alice and Bob to distill a\nsecret key from the sifted raw key that is inaccessible to\nthe adversary, Eve. With forward reconciliation [22] and\n\nFIG. 1: Mutual informations for entangled photon pairs generated by Type-I PDC in BBO crystal. This figure shows\nhow the crystal length and the pump waist affects the averaged mutual information in momentum and position.\n\nprivacy amplification [23], the achievable secret key rate\nin momentum is bounded below by\n\u2206I = IAB \u2212 IAE = H(kA | E) \u2212 H(kA | kB ),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere E is the result of Eve's measurement on her ancilla.\nFor individual attacks, it has been shown that there exists\nthe entropic uncertainty relation [24]\nH(kA | E) + H(rA | rB ) \u2265 log2 \u03c0e,\n\n(5)\n\nThe conditional entropy is bounded by [25]\nH(xA | xB ) \u2264\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nlog2 2\u03c0e\u22062 (xA | xB ) ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere x stands for k or r, while \u22062 denotes the variance.\nBy combining Eqs. (4-6), we find\n\u2206I \u2265 log2 \u03c0e \u2212 H(rA | rB ) \u2212 H(kA | kB )\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n1\n.\n\u2265 log2\n2\n4 \u22062 (rA | rB )\u22062 (kA | kB )\n\n(7)\n\nSo a sufficient condtion for \u2206I \u2265 0 is\n\u22062 (rA | rB )\u22062 (kA | kB ) \u2264\n\n1\n4\n\n(8)\n\nThis result also applies for the security analysis in position. For high entanglement, this condition coincides\nwith the EPR criterion [26]. It is easy to prove from Eq.\n(2) that the states generated by PDC satisfy this condition, as demonstrated recently [14, 15, 27]. Note, however, almost all of these experiments employ one detector\nto scan through the momentum or position values, so in\nprinciple the outcome of each measurement is binary: either the photon hits the detector or not. Therefore this\nsetup is not suitable for single-photon CV-QKD. To realise the full potential of continuous variables without\n\n\f3\ncomplex encoding, a sufficiently large array of detectors\n(APDs, pixels of a CCD camera, etc.) is needed to ensure\nthat binning and truncating do not significantly diminish the information transfer rate [28]. This implies that\nthe dark count of the detectors will have a much higher\nimpact on the error rate than in standard BB84, though\nthe probability that Eve can guess the correct result also\ndecreases with the increased number of detectors.\nTo see this, assume that the entangled photon pair is\ngenerated from the pump pulse with probability PP DC\nand sent to Alice and Bob through two quantum channels with throughtputs tA and tB . To measure the continuous variables r \u22a5 or k\u22a5 each party maps the distribution to n identical detectors that are time-gated synchronously with the pump pulse. We denote the probability of recording a dark count within the detection time\nwindow for each detector as Pdark and its efficiency as \u03b7.\nAlice and Bob keep the results when one and only one\ndetector clicks. So there are three cases to be considered:\n(1) both parties have a dark count; (2) one party detects\na photon and the other has a dark count; (3) both parties\ndetect a photon. The probabilities for each case are:\nP1 = [1 \u2212 PP DC + PP DC (1 \u2212 \u03b7tA )(1 \u2212 \u03b7tB )]\n2\n\u00d7 n2 Pdark\n(1 \u2212 Pdark )2n\u22122 ,\n\nP2 = PP DC [\u03b7tA (1 \u2212 \u03b7tB ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b7tA )\u03b7tB ]\n\u00d7 nPdark (1 \u2212 Pdark )2n\u22121 ,\nP3 = PP DC \u03b7 2 tA tB (1 \u2212 Pdark )2n .\n\n(9a)\n(9b)\n(9c)\n\nrespectively. The probability that the photon and a dark\ncount arise at the same detector simultaneously is negligible. Among all the cases, only P3 will reveal the quantum\ncorrelations. This probability decreases as the channel\nloss and number of detectors increase due to the increase\nof the background noise level. Some typical values for the\nrealistic system with APDs as detectors and nanosecond\ntime gating are PP DC = 0.01, \u03b7 = 0.6 and Pdark = 10\u22126 .\nWe fix the length of the BBO crystal to 2mm and assume a 2mm pump waist (FWHM). The source lies at\nAlice's station, i.e. tA \u2248 1 and tB = t, where t is the\ntransmission of the channel between Alice and Bob. Taking into account the dark count contribution according\nto Eq. (9), Eq. (8) is satisfied for channel throughput\nabove t = 36% (68%) (4.4dB (1.7dB) channel loss) assuming a detector array with n = 128 (256) pixels. For\nfree space transmission the extinction coefficient varies\nover a large range [29]. Here we assume it is 1dB/km, so\nthe corresponding distance is 4.4km and 1.7km respectively. At these distances the probability of uncorrelated\nevents P1 + P2 is less than 1%, which means that the\nnoise level is still extremely low.\nAnalysis of the variance product seems to suggest that\nthis QKD scheme is not suitable for long-distance use.\nBut we note that Eq. (8) is a tight bound for general\nCV-QKD schemes and it is possible to loosen the bound\n\nwhen considering the special characteristics of the experimental imperfections in the single-photon CV-QKD\nprotocol. Reconsidering Eqs. (4-8), note that the equality in Eq. (7) can only be achieved when Eve's attacks\nsatisfy certain strict conditions. The most important\ncondition is that the distribution of Bob's measurement\noutcomes conditioned on Alice's results should be Gaussian [25]. A Gaussian attack is well known to be optimal for conventional CV-QKD using the quadratures of\nmulti-photon states since in these systems experimental\nimperfections-mainly the loss of the channel-will preserve the Gaussian character of the transmitted state,\nbroadening Bob's distribution. By replacing the channel with a lossless one and applying a Gaussian attack,\nEve can hide behind the existing experimental imperfections. The normal way for Alice and Bob to detect Eve\nis to monitor the covariance matrix of their results. In\ncontrast, for single-photon dichotomic-variable QKD, the\nexperimental imperfections (loss, noise, etc) yield uncorrelated detection events between Alice and Bob, which\nare typically interpreted as background noise. In singlephoton CV-QKD the experimental imperfections play a\nsimilar role to those in standard dichotomic single-photon\nQKD. The events registered by each party are either from\nthe PDC photons or from the detector noise, and the\nlatter has a uniform distribution. Hence Alice and Bob\nexpect un-broadened Gaussian joint probability distributions from the quantum correlation measurements interspersed with uncorrelated flat background events, which\nin total represents a non-Gaussian distribution. In order to stay undetected Eve must mimic this distribution,\ntherefore she only has limited options and the optimal attack for multi-photon CV-QKD is prohibited here. Moreover, for non-Gaussian distributions, the left side of Eq.\n(7) can be much bigger than the right side, which means\neven when the EPR condition is violated, it is still possible for Alice and Bob to draw the secret key.\nA possible eavesdropping strategy that satisfies the\nabove conditions is an intercept-resend attack: Eve intercepts the photon sent to Bob, measures it in the randomly\nchosen variable (momentum or position), and resends a\nphoton in the eigenstate based on her measurement result. If, by chance, she has chosen the same measurement\nbasis as Alice and Bob, her operation will appear as an\nundisturbed channel between these two parties. Otherwise, measuring the conjugate variable Eve introduces\na flat background noise, which cannot be distinguished\nfrom the dark noise of the detector array. Therefore by\nadjusting the loss of the channel, Eve can hide her disturbance behind the experimental imperfections. We define\nan intercept-resend ratio \u03bb as\n\u03bb=\n\nNumber of photons intercepted by Eve\n.\nTotal number of photons Alice sends to Bob\n\nBy balancing the disturbance introduced by Eve with the\nbackground noise, which originates from the experimen-\n\n\f4\n\n256\n\n128\n\nFIG. 2: The minimum secret information per recorded photon pair (\u2206I min ) is estimated numerically from \u03bbmax . The\ncorresponding channel loss l is calculated from Eq. (10). The\ninitial entangled photons are generated by a 2mm-long BBO\ncrystal and a pump at 400nm with 2mm beam waist.\n\ntal imperfections, we find an allowed maximum interceptresend ratio for Eve is:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f2\n\uf8fd\n2n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03bbmax \u2248 min\n,\n1\n(10)\n\u0001\n\uf8f3 1 \u22121\n1\n\uf8fe\n\u22121 +n\nl\n\nPdark\n\nwhere l is the channel loss and n is the number of detectors. For a lossless channel (l = 0) or noiseless detectors\n(Pdark = 0), \u03bbmax = 0, i.e. no eavesdropping is possible;\nwhile for fixed l and Pdark , \u03bbmax increases with n. Eq.\n(10) clearly shows how the experimental imperfections\nopen loopholes for Eve to attack. Moreover, the minimum secret information that Alice and Bob are able to\nmin\nmax\ndistill (\u2206I min = IAB\n\u2212 IAE\n) can be directly estimated\nfrom \u03bbmax . The relation between \u2206I min and the channel\ntransmission loss is shown in Fig. 2. Comparing this result with the variance product analysis, it is evident that\nthe secure loss level (35dB for n = 128) is significantly\nimproved for this eavesdropping strategy.\nAn important question in quantum cryptography is the\nrelationship between entanglement and security. It has\nbeen proved that distributed entanglement between Alice and Bob is a necessary precondition for secret key\ndistribution [30]. Also the connection between quantum\nand secret correlations has been established [31]. Nevertheless it is still not clear how to draw a secure key\nfrom the distributed entanglement. For classical privacy\namplification (forward or reverse reconciliation), the security limit is usually a stronger condition than the entanglement threshold [32]. In the intercept-resend attack\nfor our protocol, the logarithm negativity as a function\nof the intercept fraction \u03bb shows that Alice and Bob remain entangled until \u03bb = 1, while as Fig. 2 and Eq.\n(10) show, the classical privacy amplification requires\n\u03bb < 75% (where \u2206I min = 0) to draw the secret key.\nHence for a practical QKD scheme, the detection of en-\n\ntanglement may not be enough for secret key distillation.\nTo conclude, we have shown the potential to transfer more than one bit of information per photon using\nthe spatial degrees of freedom of the entangled photon\npairs. Due to the special non-Gaussian distributions of\nAlice and Bob's measurement results, the options for\neavesdropping are severely limited. A detailed security\nanalysis on a plausible attack, intercept-resend, is given.\nWhether Eve gains by means of more powerful attacks\nrequires further study. In particular, a more detailed\nanalysis of the impact of binning the information is required for a practical QKD system with limited number\nof detectors. Refinement of the security analysis will also\ntake into account of the turbulence effects for free space\ntransmission, which will give Eve more options to attack.\nThis work was supported by EPSRC, EC under the\nIntegrated Project QAP funded by the IST director as\nContract No. 015848.
