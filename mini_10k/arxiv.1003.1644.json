Infrared: galaxies - Galaxies: evolution - Galaxies: interactions - Galaxies: peculiar\n\n1. Introduction\nCompact groups of galaxies were identified as systems of several galaxies that, owing to their small projected separations\nand signs of tidal distortion, appear to be real physical entities of gravitationally interacting systems (Hickson 1997). Since\nthe discovery in 1877 of Stephan's Quintet, the prototypical\ngroup, many others have been found by both visual and automated searches of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey plates.\nAlthough the criteria for assigning group membership based\nonly on imaging data have often been debated, it is now generally accepted that the most complete and better studied of these\nsamples is the one compiled by Hickson (1982). His catalog of\nthe so\u2013called Hickson compact groups (hereafter HCGs) consists of 451 galaxies contained in 100 groups of four or more\ngalaxies, that occupy compact configurations within relatively\nisolated regions where no excess of other surrounding galaxies\ncan be seen (see Hickson 1982, for details on the criteria used).\nMore recently, it has been revealed that the HCG catalog is incomplete because several compact groups are apparent associations of galaxies along the line of sight. However, compact group\ncatalogs, produced with redshift information, to select galaxies\nthat are physically close, are dense (Mamon & Diaz-Gimenez\n2009).\nOver the past 20 years, various detailed analyses of HCGs\nhave been performed using multi\u2013wavelength imaging and specSend offprint requests to: T. Bitsakis, e-mail: bitsakis@physics.uoc.gr\n\ntroscopy. Based on optical morphology alone, it is obvious that\nthe overwhelming majority of HCGs display an excess of elliptical galaxies (\u223c31% of the total) while their spiral fraction\nis just 43%, nearly a factor of two less than what is observed\nin the field (Hickson 1982). Rubin et al. (1991) have found\nthat two thirds of HCG spirals display peculiar rotation curves,\nwhile Zepf & Whitmore (1993) report that ellipticals in compact\ngroups are likely to have irregular isophotes and exhibit lower\ninternal velocity dispersions for their luminosities, so that they\ndo not lie on the fundamental plane of isolated field ellipticals.\nInterestingly, the luminosity function derived for HCG members\nis deficient at the faint end compared to other samples. All these\nclues are consistent with an evolutionary pattern of tidal encounters and the accretion of small companions by the group members. Furthermore, Mendes de Oliveira & Hickson (1994) also\nshow that 43% of all HCG galaxies display morphological features of interactions and mergers, such as bridges, tails, and other\ndistortions.\nThe HCGs appear to occupy a unique position in the range\nof galaxy environments found in the local universe. While\ntheir density enhancements are high, close to those seen in\nrich clusters, the overdensities appear to be more locally contained, with a much smaller population involved in the enhancement. Furthermore, the HCG velocity dispersions are \u03c3V \u223c250\nkm s\u22121 , lower than what is seen in rich clusters but higher than\nthat of typical loose groups. In addition, a clear correlation exists\nbetween the group velocity dispersion and the elliptical galaxy\n\n\f2\n\nBitsakis et al.: Infrared study of Hickson compact groups\n\nfraction, with the highest values of \u03c3V to be found in the most\nelliptical rich groups (Hickson et al 1988).\nDespite this progress, several open questions remain. Are\ncompact groups a transient phenomenon fading out after the\nmerging of all their galaxies into a giant field elliptical? Were\nthey more numerous in the early universe, and can they account\nfor all, or most, present-day giant ellipticals? Are they dynamically closed systems, or can they replenish the intergalactic\nmedium with reprocessed material in the form of diffuse tails\nand tidal dwarf galaxies?\nA necessary step in determining of the evolutionary state\nof HCGs is the complete census and analysis of the member galaxies' stellar population, gas content, and star formation\nproperties. Even though only a few HCGs have been mapped\nin detail in neutral hydrogen, single-dish measurements reveal\nthat they are generally deficient in HI with a median mass of\nMHI \u223c 2.2 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , two times less than what is observed in\nloose groups (Williams & Rood 1987; Verdes-Montenegro et al.\n2001). However, the molecular gas content of their individual\ngalaxies, as traced by the CO emission, is similar to that of interacting pairs and starburst galaxies (Leon et al. 1998). Nearly\n40% of the HCG members for which nuclear spectroscopy has\nbeen obtained display evidence of active galactic nuclei (AGN),\nand it has been argued that those contain copious amounts of\ndust (Shimada et al. 2000). Up to now, however, there is scant\ninformation on the far-IR colors and luminosities of the individual galaxies of the groups, because the available IRAS measurements have typically not resolved the groups, especially at\n60 and 100 \u03bcm, providing only a single value and color for the\nensemble of their galaxies. Despite this limitation, it has been\nshown that compact groups have warm far-IR colors, similar to\nthose of merging gas-rich galaxies (Zepf 1993). If one recalls\nthat HCGs are in fact deficient in spirals and that the far-IR flux\nof field ellipticals is typically below the IRAS detection limit,\none may speculate that vigorous star formation activity may actually take place in some locations within the groups. Could this\nactivity be in circumnuclear regions of weak, enshrouded AGN\nbecause of the dynamical torques exerted in the gas from small\nnuclear bars funneling it to the center (Combes 2001)? Would\nit be possible instead that there is star formation due to shocked\ncompressed gas outside the main bodies of galaxies as seen in\nStephan's Quintet (Xu et al 1999; Appleton et al. 2006)?\nA first analysis of the mid-infared properties of 12 HCG using Spitzer imagery has been presented by Johnson et al. (2007)\nand Gallagher et al. (2008). These authors use near- and mid-IR\ncolor diagnostics to reveal a possible excess thermal emission\ndue to an active nucleus (AGN). They also separate the groups\ninto three types based on the ratio of their neutral hydrogen to\ndynamical mass, and find that most groups are either gas-rich\nor gas-poor, while very few groups are found in an intermediate\nstate. As expected, gas-rich groups are the ones that are more\nactively forming stars. In addition, an absence of intermediate\nstage groups is apparent, which would be consistent with a rapid\nevolution of the group members, probably the result of dynamical interactions.\nIn this paper we present the first results of our detailed analysis of the deep near-IR, mid-IR, and far-IR imagery of 14 HCGs\nand place them in the context of similar results for samples of\nisolated galaxies and early-stage interacting systems. In Section\n2, we describe our data and reduction processes, along with the\ncontrol samples used. In Section 3, we describe how we model\nthe infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of all galaxies in\nthe groups. Our results on the physical properties of each galaxy\nsuch as star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, dust content, and\n\nFig. 1. A \"true color\" image of HCG57 based on the Palomar\nJ,H, and Ks data (Slater et al. 2004). This is the largest group\nof our sample containing 4 early and 4 late-type galaxies. The\ngalaxy triplet consisting of members A, C and D is also known\nas Arp 320. Galaxy A is classified as an AGN.\n\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR) are presented in Section 4.\nWe discuss the implications of these findings in Section 5, and\npresent our conclusions in Section 6.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nOur sample of 14 HCGs contains 69 galaxies, 31 of which are\nearly-type and 38 late-type galaxies. It was selected in a random fashion from the original Hickson catalog (see Table 1\nof Hickson 1982) and is presented in Table 1. The only constraint applied was that the group members had to be separated\nenough to allow more accurate photometry, but also contained\nenough within \u223c 5\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032 to be efficiently imaged by the Widefield Infrared Camera (WIRC) at the Palomar 5m telescope. This\nconstrains our sample to nearby groups typically with 5 or 6\nmembers. Despite the small numbers, the sample can be considered representative of Hickson's catalog having an early-type\ngalaxy fraction of \u223c 40% and a spiral and irregular galaxy fraction of just \u223c 60% of the total. Furthermore, as we discuss in\nsection 4.2, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests indicate that the\nmass distribution of our subsample, estimated by their Ks-band\nluminosites, is representative of the whole HCG sample. Nine\ngalaxies of our sample are classified as AGN based on optical\nspectroscopy, even though this number is probalby a lower limit\ngiven the sparse spectroscopic coverage. In Figures 1 and 2, we\nshow typical images of one group of our sample, HCG 57, using\nthe J, H, Ks, and IRAC filters.\n\n\fBitsakis et al.: Infrared study of Hickson compact groups\n\nFig. 2. A Spitzer/IRAC \"true color\" image of the same group.\nThe blue channel traces the 3.6\u03bcm emission, the green the\n4.5\u03bcm, and red the 8.0\u03bcm. Galaxies A, B, and D have very luminous spiral arms, and when examined more closely, they appear\nto contain some bright mid-IR spots.\n\n2.1. Near-infared observations\n\nDeep near-IR observations were obtained with the Wide Field\nInfrared Camera (WIRC) of the 5m Hale telescope at Palomar,\nduring several observing runs in the 2002 and 2003 observing\nperiods. All groups were imaged in the J, H, and Ks bands for\nan on-source time of 20 minutes per filter (Slater et al. 2004).\nThe 20 minute exposures were taken in multiple shorter segments to avoid saturation by the sky brightness. The telescope\nwas dithered in a 3- or 5-position pattern during the exposure. Due to sizable telescope nodding as well as dithering,\nit was necessary to perform astrometry on each of the shorter\nexposure images separately. This was done with the softwarepackage WCSTools (Mink 2004), matching foreground stars\nto the USNO A2.0 and 2MASS point source catalogs. Once a\nWorld Coordinate System (WCS) was established for each image, they were pixel-resampled and coadded using the Swarp\npackage (Bertin 2008). Source extraction was performed with\nSExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). The flux was calibrated to a\nlevel of 0.1mag using near-IR standards, and it was bootstrapped\nto 2MASS foreground stars, which were detected in both our images. Our 1\u03c3 sensitivity limit was \u223c 21.5 mag arcsec\u22122 in J and\nH bands and \u223c20.5 mag arcsec\u22122 . A near-IR image of the group\nHCG 57 is presented in Figure 1.\n2.2. Mid-infrared Spitzer observations\n\nObservations of these groups were obtained between 2008\nJanuary and 2009 March in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0\u03bcm broadband filters of the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC,\nFazio et al. 2004) and the 24\u03bcm band of the Multiband Imaging\nPhotometer for Spitzer (MIPS, Rieke et al. 2004) (PID: 40459).\nThe IRAC observations were obtained with a 270sec exposure\nper filter for each set of cameras (see Fig. 2). All groups had an\n\n3\n\nangular size small enough to fit within the 5\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032 field of view\nof IRAC. The on-source time for the 24\u03bcm MIPS observations\nwas 375.4sec.\nThe IRAC postpipeline Basic Calibrated Data were downloaded and mosaicked onto the same grid with a pixel scale of\n1.2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 1.2\u2032\u2032 . The 1\u03c3 sensitivity limits varyied slightly for each\ngroup owing to changes in the background. Typical 3\u03c3 limits\nwere measured to be \u223c 0.04 MJy sr\u22121 , \u223c 0.05 MJy sr\u22121 , \u223c 0.2\nMJy sr\u22121 , and \u223c 0.2 MJy sr\u22121 , for the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0\u03bcm filters, respectively. Since most of the galaxies have disturbed morphologies, simple fixed aperture photometry was often not the\nmost appropriate method of measuring the object flux. Thus, we\ncarefully calculated the isophotal contours around each source\nto properly account for variations in the shape of the emitting\nregion. Examining the local background for each galaxy we defined a limiting isophote 3\u03c3 above the overall background and\nmeasured the flux within this region, after subtracting the corresponding sky. Even this method was challenging in some cases,\nso we defined the physical extent of each galaxy by hand using a\npolygon, and performed the photometry accordingly. The fluxes\nwe report are for the same regions for all IRAC, and MIPS, images. Finally, we applied an extended source correction to our\nphotometry by multiplying our measured fluxes with a correction factor of 0.91, 0.94, 0.71, and 0.74 for the corresponding 1\nto 4 IRAC bands as indicated in the IRAC data handbook.\nThe MIPS postpipeline images have a pixel scale of 2.45\u2032\u2032 \u00d7\n2.45\u2032\u2032 , and their depth was measured as \u223c 0.3 MJy sr\u22121 or \u223c\n250\u03bcJy for a point source. In several cases the nuclei of galaxies\nwere saturated and the frames were corrected using the IDP3 of\nIDL1 . We estimate that our final uncertainties in the IRAC and\nMIPS photometry are \u223c 5%.\nTo ascertain variations between the nuclear and total mid-IR\nSED of each galaxy, we also performed nuclear photometry for\nour sources using the smallest aperture possible. The motivation\nbehind this work was to examine whether the observed SEDs\nof some sources are dominated by the contribution of a strong\nnuclear emission, possibly due to the presence of an AGN. The\napertures used were 3 pixels (3.6\") in diameter for the IRAC\nimages and 5 pixels (12.2\") for the MIPS, based on the size of\nthe corresponding point spread function (PSF).\n2.3. Mid-infrared 12\u03bcm ISO/CAM data\n\nArchival observations for a fraction of the galaxies were retrieved from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) data archive.\nThe observations were performed with the ISO/CAM instrument (Cesarsky et al. 1996), using the LW10 filter (Program\nHCGROU-A). The LW10 filter is centered on \u03bb = 11.7\u03bcm, and\ncovers the 8.5 \u2212 15.5\u03bcm range so that it matches the IRAS 12\u03bcm\nbandpass. The pixel size was 6\u2032\u2032 \u00d76\u2032\u2032 , and it is larger than the PSF\nof the telescope at this wavelength. The total on-source exposure\ntime for the galaxies varied between 200 and 300sec.\nThe ISO/CAM data were analyzed with the CIR data processing software, an implementation of the algorithms of Starck\n(1999) developed by P. Chanial. The standard ISO/CAM data\nreduction procedure was followed. First the data, were read\ninto the CIR environment. Then the \"correct-dark-vilspa\" routine was applied to correct for the dark current. This was followed by applying the multiresolution algorithm \"correct-glitchmr\". Next, the \"correct-transient-fs\" routine, based on the FouksSchubert transient correction method (Coulais & Abergel 2000),\n1\nIDP3 is the Image Display Paradigm 3 package available for the\nInteractive Data Language (IDL)\n\n\f4\n\nBitsakis et al.: Infrared study of Hickson compact groups\n\nwas applied to the data to remove transient effects. The frames\nwere flat-fielded using the CIR's library flat field, and subsequently combined to produce a final image. Some masking on\nthe edges of the images was performed to correct for bad pixels.\nPhotometry was performed by selecting the regions of galaxies\nwith emission greater than 3\u03c3 above the sky background noise.\nWe estimate that the absolute uncertainty of our photometric\nmeasurements is \u223c 10%, mainly owing to errors in the correction of the detector transient effect.\n2.4. Comparison samples\n\nWe compare our findings to the published mid-IR data on the\nHCG of the Johnson et al. (2007) sample, as well as on two \"control\" samples, for which a similar type of data exist. One is the\nnearby \"normal\" sample of 75 field galaxies from the Spitzer\nInfrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS; Kennicutt et al. 2003;\nDale et al. 2005). The SINGS sample was selected to cover a\nwide range in Hubble type and luminosity. Most objects are latetype systems that have angular sizes between 5\u2032 and 15\u2032 . It also\ncontains four early-type galaxies (NGC 855, 1377, 3773, and\n4125) with the last one being a LINER. The second comparison\nsample contains the 36 nearby (v<11.000 km s\u22121 ) early stage\ninteracting galaxy pairs of Smith et al. (2007a). The galaxies in\nthe Smith sample are tidally disturbed and fairly extended, with\nlinear sizes > 3\u2032 . We note that 13 galaxies of this sample are classified as LINERs and 3 as Seyferts. The motivation behind the\ncomparison of our HCG sample to these samples was to investigate how the group environment affects the infrared properties\nof galaxies, in contrast to isolated systems, because of a single\ncompanion galaxy. The basic properties of the three samples are\npresented in Figure 3. The mid-IR activity in groups, as traced\nby the 24\u03bcm and 8\u03bcm luminosity, is similar in all three samples, suggestive that as samples there is no substantial difference\nin their SFR. This has already been pointed out by Smith et al.\n(2007a), who find that there was no more than a factor of two difference between the SFR in isolated (SINGS) galaxies and early\nstage interacting pairs. The K-band luminosities, hence the stellar mass distributions, are also similar with the exception of the\ninteracting pairs, who do not extend to masses below \u223c 108 M\u2299 .\n\n3. Spectral energy distribution fitting\nTo estimate the physical properties of the galaxies in our sample in a systematic way, we first fit the observed SED of each\ngalaxy with a set of theoretical and empirical SED models from\nLe Phare2 (see Arnouts et al. 2007; Ilbert et al. 2009). We compared the observed near-IR J, H, and Ks fluxes, as well as the\nmid-IR fluxes from Spitzer and ISO to the ones predicted using\nthe Le Phare template SEDs.\nUsing multi-wavelength template libraries, Le Phare is able\nto perform a two-component galaxy SED modeling by decomposing the fit of each source into the contribution of its stellar\npopulations and the contribution from thermal dust emission.\nThe near-IR observations is strongly dominated by stellar blackbody emission, with a possibly small contribution from very hot\ndust in the case of an active nucleus (AGN). In late-type, starforming galaxies, two of the IRAC bands, centered on 5.8 and\n8\u03bcm, may contain the contribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and finally the 24\u03bcm luminosity traces ther-\n\nFig. 3. Comparison of the K-band, 8\u03bcm, and 24\u03bcm luminosities\nof our samples: HCGs (top panels), field galaxies (middle panels), and interacting pair galaxies (lower panels).\n\nmal emission from dust mostly heated in embedded star-forming\nregions. Consequently the templates used to fit the data should\nbe compatible with those characteristics. A first fit of the nearIR J, H, and Ks photometry was obtained using pure stellar\ntemplates taken from the library of SEDs used by Ilbert et al.\n2\nFor\nmore\ninformation\non\nLe\nPhare (2009) to derive galaxy photometric redshifts. The goal of this\nvisit\nthe\nweb\npage\nof\nthe\npackage\nat initial step was to estimate the contribution of the underlying\nhttp://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/\u223carnouts/LEPHARE/cfht lephare/lephare.htmlstellar component to the emission observed in the Spitzer bands\n\n\fBitsakis et al.: Infrared study of Hickson compact groups\n\nat longer wavelengths. This contribution was subsequently subtracted from the IRAC and MIPS fluxes assuming an extrapolation of a typical stellar blackbody emission, and the resulting\nfluxes were fitted between 5 and 24\u03bcm using a separate library\nof IR SEDs. For the IR SEDs, we used a modified version of\nthe IR template library of Chary & Elbaz (2001), which includes\n105 star-forming galaxy IR SEDs over a broad range of total IR\nluminosities. These templates cover the optical to radio wavelength range, so their stellar component was systematically removed prior to the fitting with Le Phare to reproduce only the\nthermal dust component of our sources. For each galaxy of our\nsample, the best total fit was then obtained by co-adding the fit\nderived for the stellar component and the one obtained in the\nmid-IR. Galaxies with very low 24\u03bcm emission, mostly earlytype systems, were only fitted with a single stellar component,\nsince subtracting it from the 24\u03bcm flux would introduce a large\nuncertainty to the final estimate of the thermal dust emission.\nIn Figure A.1 of the appendix we present the infrared SEDs\nof each galaxy along with the best-fit model from Le Phare. Each\npanel corresponds to one group; groups with more than six members are plotted in two figures. The galaxies are labeled with their\nHCG number, type, and spectral classification, if known. The\nvertical error bars indicate the uncertainty of each measurement,\nwhile horizontal bars show the bandwidth of the corresponding\nfilter.\nMost SED fits are fairly good as is evident from the plots and\nthe corresponding reduced \u03c72 values, which vary between 1 and\n11 and are marked in each plot. A number of galaxies display\nmid-IR fluxes consistent with strong PAH emission and often\nwarm dust, a sign of enhanced star formation activity. There are,\nthough, some galaxies (such as HCG26a, 26e, or 57a) that are\nnot fitted as well by the templates. These galaxies display an excess emission in the Ks-band and/or mid-IR, which is suggestive\nof some type of nuclear activity, possibly from an AGN. Even\nif star formation and thus PAH emission were present in these\nsystems, the nuclear thermal dust emission would dominate the\nemitted flux, resulting in rather flat or rising mid-IR spectrum.\nWe also compared our galaxy classification based on the\ntemplates of the SED fit to existing optical morphology classification. Our data, as do the SED fits, indicate that some of\nthe galaxies, classified as early-type based on the optical images, do have excess dust emission. These are HCG26b, 37c,\n37e, 55a, 55b, 55d, 56b, 56d, 56e, 71b, 79b, 95b, and 95d. This\nimplies that either embedded star formation or accretion of gasrich dwarf galaxies have fueled these systems with enough dust\nand gas to emit strongly in the mid-IR. All of them seem to\nhave late-type galaxy SEDs in the infrared. Three (HCG37c,\n56b, and 56d) are spectroscopically classified as AGN in the optical, while others exhibit a mid-IR SED that is suggestive of\nemission from an AGN. Interestingly, there are also galaxies that\nhave IR SEDs consistent with that of an early-type galaxy. These\ninclude HCG38d and HCG95b, which are nonetheless classified\nas late-type in the optical. This could be due to the loss of a large\nfraction of their gas and dust, probably because of interactions,\nwhich would be the result of the absence of far-infrared emission. One of the galaxies in our sample, HCG 40f, which did not\nhave a classification in the literature, has been fitted with an E1\ngalaxy template, consistent with its morphological appearance\nin the optical and infrared images.\nIt is known that the Ks band luminosity is a good tracer of\nthe stellar mass because light in this band is dominated by the\nemission of low-mass stars, which are responsible for the bulk\nof stellar mass in galaxies. Similarly, the 24\u03bcm emission is a\ngood tracer of star formation because it originates in regions of\n\n5\n\nFig. 4. The Lacy et al. (2004) IRAC color diagnostic.

We used the observed Ksband and 24\u03bcm luminosities (LK and L24\u03bcm ) to estimate the corresponding stellar mass and SFR for each galaxy. To obtain the\ngalaxy mass, we used the Bell et al. (2003) relation where the\nmass, in M\u2299 , is (0.95\u00b10.03)\u00d7 LK (L\u2299 ), where LK is in units of\nK-band solar luminosity (LK,\u2299 =4.97\u00d71025W), with systematic\nerrors of \u223c 30%, owing to uncertainties in the star formation history and dust. The SFR was estimated from the 24\u03bcm by the calibration developed by Calzetti et al. (2007) for the SINGS sample\n:\nSFR(M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 1.27\u00d710\u221238(L24\u03bcm (erg sec\u22121 ))0.885 .\nOur mass and SFR estimates are reported in Table 2 along with\na measure of the sSFR of our sources defined as the ratio of SFR\nover the galaxy stellar mass.\n\n4. Results\n4.1. IRAC colors and AGN diagnostics\n\nAGN are often deeply enshrouded in dust that may heavily absorb the emitted radiation, in particular in the UV, optical, and\neven in the X-rays in some extreme cases. The energy is then\nre-emitted isotropically at longer wavelengths in the mid- and\nfar-IR (see Charmandaris 2008; Elitzur 2008, and references\ntherein). As a result, active galaxies often display an excess of\ncontinuum emission at wavelengths 2\u03bcm < \u03bb < 15\u03bcm, compared to normal or starbursting galaxies. In addition, there is\na weak PAH emission in their mid-IR spectrum, which is attributed to the destruction of their carriers by the strong radiation field surrounding the AGN (i.e. see Weedman et al. 2005;\nBrandl et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2007b). We can use our Spitzer\ninfrared photometric measurements to probe for an AGN among\n\n\f6\n\nBitsakis et al.: Infrared study of Hickson compact groups\n\nFig. 5. The Stern et al. (2005) IRAC color diagnostic. The symbols are as in Fig. 3. The gas-poor galaxies are located in the\nlower left portion and the gas-rich in the lower right. Only one\ncandidate, HCG 56b (a Seyfert 2), is found within the AGN candidate area.\nthe galaxies in our sample. Lacy et al. (2004) have defined a\nlocus in the IRAC [8.0-4.5] vs [5.8-3.6] color-color plot populated by AGN which are dominant in the infrared. Similarly,\nStern et al. (2005) propose using of the IRAC [3.6-4.5] vs [5.88.0] colors to identify their AGN candidates. Among our galaxies optical spectra were available for 24 Shimada et al. (2000),\nwith 15 classified as H II galaxies and 9 as AGNs, (3 as Sy2 and\n3 as LINERs).\nIn Figure 4, we present the IRAC colors for our sample following the Lacy et al. (2004) criteria. We separate our sample\nin early and late-type galaxies, and identify the galaxies that we\nalready know from optical spectroscopic observations host an\nactive nucleus. We also include in Figure 4 the galaxies from the\nJohnson et al. (2007) HCG sample, as well as the SINGS and interacting galaxy samples. By construction, the galaxies located\nin the lower left of the color-color plot are those dominated by\nthe stellar photospheric emission. As a result, they are expected\nto have very weak dust or PAH emission, if any. Most of our\nearly-type galaxies lie in this region. On the other hand, galaxies\nfound in the upper right quadrant of the figure should have strong\nPAH features, as well as some hot dust contribution, because\nof intense star formation, and/or AGN activity. Furthermore, as\nwe discuss in section 4.4, most of the galaxies in this quadrant\nare spirals found in spiral-rich groups. According to Lacy et al.\n(2004), galaxies located within the shaded area are AGN candidates. A total of 16 galaxies in our sample (\u223c 23%) are AGN\ncandidates based on this criterion, almost half of which are found\nin previous optical spectroscopy studies (Shimada et al. 2000;\nCoziol et al. 2000). These are 11 late-type systems (HCG 37b,\n38b, 38c, 47c, 54abcd, 57d, 71a, 79a) and 5 early-type systems\n(HCG 40f, 56b, 56e, 71b, and 95b). Of those galaxies, four are\nspectroscopically classified as AGN, while eight are classified\nas H II galaxies. In addition, as we can see from their mid-IR\nSEDs in Figure A.1, several of them do show signs of active\nnuclei, such as a flat rising continuum. It is possible, though,\nthat either because of obscuration or because some may harbor\nlow-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), the colors of the AGN are diluted when we perform the photometry over the whole galaxy.\nTo better probe the properties of the nuclear emission, we can\nexamine the nuclear SEDs of our sample, which was obtained\n\nusing circular apertures with a diameter of 3.6\u2032\u2032 in the IRAC images and 12.2\u2032\u2032 in the MIPS 24\u03bcm band. Among the AGN candidates based on the Lacy plot, the ratio of the nuclear to their\ntotal flux is not constant in all mid-IR bands, in five galaxies,\nHCG 37b, 47c, 56b, 71a, and 79a, but it peaks at 4.5\u03bcm. This\nsuggests that the nuclear contribution which possibly caused by\nhot dust heated in near sublimation temperatures by an AGN,\ncontributes substantially in this band. On the other hand, nine\ngalaxies, HCG 38b, 38c, 54abcd, 56e, 71b, and 95b, have a rising nuclear SED and a constant ratio of nuclear to total flux in\nall IRAC bands. This would be consistent with their being starforming H II galaxies.\nContrary to SINGS galaxies, which are distributed fairly uniformly along the diagonal of the color-color plot in Figure 4 and\nthe interacting galaxy pairs which are located in the upper right\nquadrant due to the fact that they contain only late-type galaxies,\nthere might be a small gap in the distribution of the HCG galaxies at the position log(S5.8 /S3.6 ) \u2243 \u22120.2 and log(S8.0 /S4.5 )\u2243 0.\nThis gap is identified in Figure 11 of Johnson et al. (2007), even\nthough it is more obvious there. These authors combine the midIR colors with estimates of the neutral hydrogen mass and dynamical mass of the their HCG sample and suggest that this\nsmall gap separates the gas-rich and gas-poor groups. The explanation is consistent with the notion that gas-poor groups will\nmostly contain early-type galaxies where PAH emission will be\nsuppressed by low star formation activity; and they will populate\nthe lower left part of the plot, while late-type gas-rich galaxies\nwill be found on the upper right. The absence of HCG galaxies\nwith intermediate mid-IR colors would imply that their evolution\nfrom the gas-rich to the gas-poor state is more rapid than what\nis observed in field galaxies, and it could be understood as the\nresult of more frequent dynamical interactions between galaxies\nin groups. As a result of the interactions, tidal forces drive the\ngas in their nuclei and create instabilities in their disk, forcing\nthem to use their gas in a more accelerated fashion.\nIn Figure 5, we also examine how the Stern et al. (2005)\ncolor-color diagnostic is applied in our data. As was the case in\nFigure 4, galaxies located in the lower left region of the plot have\nSEDs dominated by the stellar photospheric emission, while the\ngalaxies found on the right should display strong PAH and hot\ndust emission. The shaded area denotes the colors of potential\nAGN candidates. When we compare this to Figure 4, we notice\nthat only one galaxy, HCG56b, is identified as an AGN candidate. However, as discussed in the detail by Donley et al. (2008)\nthe Stern criteria may suffer in low-z because of contamination\nfrom star-forming galaxies. Consequently, in this work we adopt\nthe ones fulfilling the Lacy criteria as mid-IR identified AGN.\n4.2. Star formation activity in Hickson compact groups\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, one would expect that\ngalaxies in groups would have enhanced SFR, because of tidal\ninteractions. The 24\u03bcm emission is a good tracer of the SFR and\nfollowing the approach of (Calzetti et al. 2007), we calculated\nthe SFR for each galaxy of our groups in Section 3. In Figure 6a,\nwe plot the sSFR as a function of the mass of each galaxy, which\nwas estimated using the observed K-band luminosity (Bell et al.\n2003). We include 57 the galaxies of our sample that were detected in 24\u03bcm. In the same figure 61 normal galaxies of the\nSINGS sample are presented, along with 30 of the interacting pairs of Smith et al. (2007a) for which integrated K-band\n2MASS photometry was available. For the interacting pairs, the\naverage sSFR of the two components is given. Galaxies found\nover the dashed line, have SFRs greater than 1M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Galaxies\n\n\fBitsakis et al.: Infrared study of Hickson compact groups\n\u221211\nin interacting pairs display a median sSFR of \u223c2.96+2.70\n\u22121.41 *10\n\u22121\nyr . This is slightly higher than what is found in HCGs and field\n\u221211\ngalaxies, which have a corresponding value of \u223c1.68+1.41\n\u22121.16 *10\n\u22121\nyr . However, given the scatter seen in each population there\nis no strong statistical difference among them. As mentioned in\nSection 2.3, the interacting pair sample does not extend to the\nlower galaxy masses of the two other samples. However, even\nwhen we restrict the galaxy masses to a range that is identical\nin all three samples, an analysis using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\nstill indicates that there is no statistical difference between the\nsamples. In Figure 6b, we plot the sSFRs as a function of the\ntotal infrared luminosity (LIR ). For similar infrared luminosities, HCG members seem to have sSFRs similar to field galaxies\nand slightly lower than interacting pairs. How is this understood\ngiven that HCGs are also interacting systems?\nTo better address this issue, we decided to separate the latetype galaxies of the HCGs into two categories depending on\nwhether the group they belong to has a high or low fraction of\nlate-type galaxies. We classify a group as \"spiral-rich\" if fewer\nthan 25% of its galaxies are early-type. Conversely, a group is\n\"spiral-poor\", or elliptically dominated, if fewer than 75% of its\ngalaxies are late-type. The sSFR is a tracer of the star formation history of a galaxy, and galaxies in compact groups do experience multiple encounters with the various group members.\nConsequently we would expect that if the group is dynamically\n\"young\" (that is, its galaxies are gravitationally interacting for\nthe first time) it is more likely to be dominated by late-type\ngalaxies. Furthermore, these spiral galaxies would have not built\nup much of their stellar mass, but would have larger amounts\nof gas and dust, as well as higher SFRs and sSFR. On the other\nhand, if the group is dominated by ellipticals, it could be dynamically \"old\", since interactions and possible merging of its members over its history would have led to the formation of some\nof those ellipticals. As a result, the spirals in these groups could\nhave already built some of their stars, and their sSFR would be\nlower.\nWe thus present in Figure 7 histograms of the sSFR distribution of the samples. We notice that spirals in elliptically dominated groups have a median sSFR that is lower than in spiral-rich\ngroups. However, when we examine their distribution in detail,\n\u221211\nwe see that they have a median of \u223c1.29+3.86\nyr\u22121 , while\n\u22123.47*10\n\u221211\ngalaxies in spiral-rich groups have a median of \u223c2.71+2.45\n\u22121.29 *10\n\u22121\nyr . As explained above, this minor difference could be attributed to the possibility that, in dynamically \"old\" groups, spiral galaxies have already interacted several times in the past with\nthe other members of their groups and as a result had more time\nto increase their stellar mass. Also their SFR is much lower than\nin the past, since they have consumed most of their gas. These\ngalaxies are located in the lower left part of Lacy's plot.\nIt is interesting to note that the sSFR of spirals in spiral-rich\ngroups is similar to the sSFR of interacting pair spirals. This appears to contrast to the fact that galaxies in compact groups do\nexperience more interactions from their close neighbors, either\nmajor or minor mergers, than a single galaxy by its companion.\nA possible explanation could be that the higher velocity dispersion of compact groups (\u223c330 km s\u22121 Hickson et al. 1992), compared to typical values seen in near parabolic prograde encounters of galaxy pairs, reduces the gravitational impulse exerted\non each galaxy. Furthermore, the complex geometry and orbits\nof the group members could strip some of the gas out of these\ngalaxies rather than funnel it to the central part, thereby increasing the SFR. This is consistent with the observed morphology\nof the group members, since \u223c 43% of them display features\n\n7\n\nFig. 6. a) Specific star formation rate as a function of stellar\nmass.

Histograms of the sSFRs in the samples used. The top\nplot displays a histogram of the late-type galaxies found in\nspiral-rich groups marked with the solid line, as well as a histogram of the late-type galaxies in elliptically dominated groups\nmarked with the dashed line. The second is a histogram of the\nSINGS late-type galaxies, and the third is the corresponding one\nfor the interacting galaxy pairs. Finally, the bottom plot displays\nthe histogram of the early-type galaxies found in HGCs (in red),\nas well as the SINGS early-type galaxies (in blue), which are detected at 24\u03bcm. The arrows indicate the median sSFR value of\neach distribution.\nsuch as tidal tails, bridges, etc. (Mendes de Oliveira & Hickson\n1994). Another explanation for this similarity could be that\nspiral-rich compact groups are simply chance alignments of interacting pairs (Mamon 2008). In this scenario, two or more interacting galaxy pairs at different redshifts have a projected separation that makes them appear as a compact group. However,\n\n\f8\n\nBitsakis et al.: Infrared study of Hickson compact groups\n\nFig. 8. Plot of the ratio of the observed IRAS 60 and 100 \u03bcm\nfluxes of each group divided by the corresponding flux predicted\nby our SED fits. Since IRAS did not resolve/detect all the members of each group, several of the ratios are indicated as upper\nlimits. Filled symbols indicate spiral-poor groups.\nthis is not the case for our sample, as only real group members\nwere considered in our analysis.\n4.3. Cold dust in Hickson compact groups\n\nFor estimating the total amount of dust in a galaxy, far-IR observations are essential, since the bulk of the dust mass in galaxies\nis at low temperatures (< 20K). The only far-IR data available\nfor our sample are based on IRAS (see Allam et al. 1996), since\nthe Akari all-sky maps have not yet been released. However,\nthe IRAS data suffer from poor spatial resolution and in nearly\nall cases one cannot resolve the emission of individual group\nmembers. Even though there is no high spatial-resolution, far-IR\nimagery for groups, one would expect that gas and dust could\nbe stripped from the group members during their tidal interactions. This material could remain outside the areas of the galaxies and would have low temperature (see Xilouris et al. 2006).\nSuch a case has been detected in the nearby giant elliptical\ngalaxy Centaurus A, where \u223c15K dust has been detected outside the main body of the galaxy (see Stickel et al. 2004). This\nwas understood as a consequence of the accretion by a number\nof gas-rich dwarf companion galaxies that surround Centaurus\nA and have led to the formation of its dust lane, as well as to\nthe filaments of atomic and molecular gas that surrounds it (see\nSchiminovich et al. 1994; Charmandaris et al. 2000). Based on\nour Spitzer data, warm dust in the intragroup environment has\nbeen seen in some groups (HCG40, 54, 55, and 79) in the form\nof diffuse mid-IR light or an extended halo around groups members.\nUsing the mid-IR imaging and extrapolating to the far-IR by\nthe SED fits in this work, we can estimate the fraction of the farinfrared luminosity that is contributed by each group member to\nthe total far-IR luminosity of the whole group. We can calculate\nthe \"synthetic\" IRAS 60\u03bcm and 100\u03bcm flux densities of each\ngroup and compare them to the ones deduced by Allam et al.\n(1996). The results are presented in Table 3 and Figure 8. In most\ncases, IRAS could not detect all the members of each group,\nso upper limits were used for then. Consequently, our total flux\nestimate is an upper limit. We observe that there are 9 groups,\nHCG19, HCG26, HCG33, HCG37, HCG55, HCG57, HCG71,\n\nHCG79, and HCG95, where the emission detected by IRAS is\nclearly higher than the total emission estimated using our galaxy\nSED fits. Most of these groups display evidence of strong tidal\nencounters and merging. This agrees with half or more of their\nmembers are early-type or peculiar galaxies and are classified\nas dynamically \"old\", while only one (HCG55) has the form\nof a compact chain. It is thus likely that these groups have diffuse cold dust in the intragroup region. Part of this excess could\nalso be caused by the uncertainties introduced by our SED fits\nwhen we extrapolated to the 60 and 100\u03bcm flux of the galaxies. This uncertainty is real and can be seen if we notice that, in\nmost groups, the 100\u03bcm flux ratio is higher than the 60\u03bcm one,\npossibly because it is farther away than our last anchor point at\n24\u03bcm. A more detailed analysis of the SEDs from the UV to\nthe mid-IR for all these groups using the models developed by\nda Cunha et al. (2008), along with observations with PACS and\nSPIRE instrument onboard the Herschel Space Telescope, will\naddress this issue conclusively.\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have presented our first analysis of the nearand mid-infrared SED of 69 galaxies contained in 14 Hickson\ncompact groups, and found the following:\n- Nearly half of the galaxies in the groups, 14 out of the 32,\nwhich are optically classified as ellipticals, have mid-IR emission and colors consistent with those expected for late-type systems. We suggest that this stems from enhanced star formation\nas a result of recent gas accretion from companion galaxies in\nthe groups.\n- Based on their integrated mid-IR color, 16 galaxies (23%)\nare AGN candidates. Detailed nuclear photometry reveals that 6\nof these have nuclear mid-IR SEDs, which are inconsistent with\na mid-IR spectrum dominated by star formation.\n- We find no evidence of the SFR and build up of stellar\nmass, which would substantially differentiate late-type galaxies\nin groups from galaxies in early-stage interacting pairs, or spiral\ngalaxies in the field. This is a surprise given that the group environment has played an important role in the evolution of the\ngalaxies, shown by the fact that most groups contain a large\nfraction of early-type systems. However, late-type galaxies in\ndynamically \"old\" HCGs might have a lower, though not statistically significant, sSFR than those in dynamically \"young\"\ngroups, which could be attributed to multiple past interactions.\n- We investigated the contribution of each galaxy to the total\nfar-IR emission of its group, and identify 9 groups where extended cold dust emission may be present.\nAcknowledgements.

A detailed analysis of the\nmid-IR and near-IR color profiles of the galaxies will be the subject of a future paper.\n\u2013 HCG19: Galaxy a is faint in the mid-IR displaying only a\nluminous core at 8\u03bcm. Member b is very bright in all mid-IR\nbands, and its spiral arms are clearly visible at 5.8, and 8\u03bcm,\nlikely due to associated PAH emission. Finally, galaxy c has\nfaint extended emission in all bands.\n\u2013 HCG26: This is a very dense group. Members a, b, d, and g\nare merging with a and e the brightest. There is also a feature\nsimilar to a tidal tail over galaxy g which is visible in the\noptical images but not in the mid-IR.\n\u2013 HCG33: Galaxies a, b, and d are early-type and so are very\nfaint in the mid-IR; however, galaxy c is classified as type\nSdm and is very bright in all Spitzer bands.\n\u2013 HCG37: Member a displays a very bright extended halo in\nthe first IRAC band, but it is not so bright in the other bands.\nMember b presents strong nuclear emission at 8 and 24 \u03bcm.\nMember d is also bright in these wavelengths. Finally, member c has an IR-bright nucleus, and it is spectroscopically\nclassified as a low-luminosity AGN.\n\u2013 HCG38: Galaxies b and c form an interacting pair both displaying very luminous extended tails with bright spots, possibly because of giant HII regions. Galaxy a is also luminous\nin the mid-IR.\n\u2013 HCG40: There is a 3.6\u03bcm extended halo around the group.\nGalaxies c and d are very bright, especially at 24\u03bcm. We\ncan also clearly see the spiral arms of member e, as well as\nnuclear emission in a and b.\n\u2013 HCG47: Galaxy a has a very bright nucleus and spiral arms\nwhile a mid-IR luminous bridge connects it to member b,\nwhich only has faint emission away from its nucleus. Galaxy\nc is also bright. Finally, member d is also rather faint in the\nmid-IR emission.\n\u2013 HCG54: Member b is a very bright galaxy, in particular at\n24\u03bcm. Member a appears to have two cores. One is bright at\n24\u03bcm and the other is so the 5.6 and 8\u03bcm bands.\n\u2013 HCG55: An extended halo at 3.6\u03bcm, is seen around the\ngroup. Galaxies c and e are most luminous especially at\n24\u03bcm.\n\u2013 HCG56: Member b is the brightest galaxy of this group and\none of the brightest of our sample. Galaxies a, d, and e are\nmid-IR luminous, while c has a bright nucleus visible only\nin the four IRAC bands. Finally, there is a bridge between\nmembers b and c seen only in 3.6\u03bcm, suggesting that it contains mostly stars.\n\u2013 HCG57: Galaxies a and d have very luminous spirals, also\npresenting some mid-IR bright spots. They also seem to have\na common halo at 24\u03bcm . Member b also has bright spiral\narms with two bright spots on them seen at 24\u03bcm. The latter\ncoincide with the location of two identified supernovae (SN2002AR and SN-2005BA).\n\u2013 HCG71: Member a has a bright nucleus and very extended\nluminous spiral arms. The nucleus of galaxy b is bright, and\nc is also mid-IR bright.\n\u2013 HCG79: There is an extended halo around the group seen in\nthe 3.6\u03bcm band. Galaxies a, b, d, and e are very luminous\nin mid-IR. There are also a tidal tail in member b and an\nextended feature over galaxy c. Finally, it seems that there is\na bridge between a and d.\n\n15\n\n\u2013 HCG95: There is a bridge connecting galaxies a and c, observed in all wavelengths with bright spots on it. Members c\nand d are mid-IR bright. Galaxy a only has a luminous nucleus, while the spiral arms of galaxy d are seen in the IRAC\nimages .\nAs seen from the above descriptions, the mid-IR morphology\nof the galaxies in the compact groups displays clear evidence\nof tidal interactions and shows the effects of the dynamically\ninduced star formation activity in them.\n\n\f16\n\nBitsakis et al.: Infrared study of Hickson compact groups\n\nFig. A.1.
