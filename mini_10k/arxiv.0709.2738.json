Nowhere is this as evident as in\nthe physics classroom. Technological innovations allow physics teachers many\ninstructional options including real-time data collection, numerical analyses of realistic\nproblems, and simulation of complex phenomena. Inclusion of these instructional tools\nimplies that technology enhances student learning.1 Research has attributed learning\ngains to technology on specific concepts within the physics curriculum.2'3'4 The impacts\nof technology on learning in an entire course are harder to isolate and less well defined.\nThis article looks at both evidence of the impacts of technology on learning in an\nintroductory algebra-based mechanics course and then learning in the specific context of\nmomentum.\n\n\fThis research is supported by a Course, Curriculum, Lab and Instruction grant from the\nNational Science Foundation, \"Re-Modeling for Algebra-based Physics.\"a The primary\npurpose of the CCLI program is to support adaptation and implementation of educational\nreforms.5 The Re-modeling Algebra-based Physics (RAP) project is built on the\nfoundation of the Re-modeling University Physics projectb from Arizona State\nUniversity. The RAP project took place at Hawaii Pacific University, a medium-sized\nliberal arts university in Hawaii. The Re-modeling project at ASU adapted the Modeling\napproach to physics instruction to calculus-based physics and the Re-modeling project at\nHPU focused on adapting to algebra-based physics.\nHands-on, studio-format classes, with the \"lab\" and \"lecture\" components integrated,\ncharacterize Modeling instruction.. The instruction is student-centered and focuses\ncreating situations where students learn to construct and validate models.6,7,8 A key\nelement in the construction and validation of models is the correspondence of the model\nto actual physical phenomenon. Ideally, high-tech data acquisition hardware and software\nsupports the development of models through real time data collection and representation.\nStudent activity centers on interpreting and analyzing the data they have collected.\nThe primary goal of the Re-modeling Algebra-based Physics project was to support the\nadaptation of labs from no-tech to high-tech. Thus, the only significant difference\nbetween the two classes being studied here, which took place during Fall 2004 and Fall\n2005, is the inclusion of high tech labs supported by PascoTM data acquisition hardware\nand data analysis software. The course format, pedagogy, instructor, student population,\neven class meeting time remained the same. The labs were all modified from existing notech hands-on labs focused on developing conceptual understanding to high-tech handson labs focused on developing conceptual understanding. As a result, the design of the\nexperiment allows for measurement of the impact of technology on learning in this\ncontext.\n\nExperimental Design\nThis study took place in an intact algebra-based introductory mechanics course (PHYS\n2030) during two subsequent years, Fall 2004 (no technology) and Fall 2005 (with\ntechnology). Like other classes at liberal-arts universities, the physics classes are small,\naveraging around 25 students, with a maximum of 30. The algebra-based physics class\nserves biology, computer science, environmental studies and pre-medical majors and like\nmany classes at HPU is made up of students from a variety of ethnicities. The first author\non this paper was the instructor for these courses.\n\na\n\nDUE #0411344\n\nb\n\nDUE #9952706\n\n\fTable I.

The surveys, could not be identical, because it would be\nimpossible for students without technology to gauge how technology would have helped,\nbut it is plausible students with technology could gauge how the technology helped in\ncomparison with other science courses that did not include technology. As a result, the\nstudent surveys were analyzed by two Physics Education Researchers (PEResearchers).\nStudent responses were characterized as either (F) favorable toward use of technology,\n(U) unfavorable toward the use of technology or (N) neutral toward the use of\ntechnology.\n\nEthnographies\nThe third data source was ethnographies written by a supporting faculty member visiting\nthe class for the momentum labs in each of the two years. Ethnography is a valuable tool\nfor providing an external characterization of the differences in instruction in the two\nyears. The first ethnography was completed in Fall 2004 and to preserve objectivity, the\nfirst author did not read the ethnography until after the second ethnography had been\ncompleted in Fall 2005. The ethnographies were read by the authors who identified the\n\n\felements of the ethnography that related to student use of technology. Then the elements\nrelating to technology were compared between the two years and quotes were selected to\ndemonstrate differences.\n\nResults and Analysis\nThe two classes, 2004 (no tech) and 2005 (tech) were compared on pretest FCI scores\nusing independent samples t-test, t(87) = 1.23, p = .220, indicating that the two classes\nstarted with equivalent understanding of Newtonian Mechanics. However, the two\nclasses differed significantly on Posttest score t(87) = 2.80, p < .01 and Hake gain t(87) =\n2.90, p < .01. Because the two classes differ significantly on FCI post, and <g> it can be\ninferred that the 2005, technology enhanced class, learned significantly more than the\n2004, no-technology class. The effect size, d, was calculated for each of the two t-tests;\nthe effect size for the FCI post, d = 2.13 and the effect size for the <g>, d = 4.06 both\nindicate large effects, using the convention proposed by Cohen, d > 0.8 are considered\nlarge effects.11 The interpretation of these statistics is clear, students learned more in a\ntechnology enhance class than in a class without technology.\nTable II.

For the\npurposes of this study if the overall pedagogy did not change, we expect to see no\ndifferences between the MPEX profiles from year to year. As can be seen in Table III,\nthe modeling course produces increases in all MPEX categories except effort, and the\nincreases are similar in both years of the study, which indicates that the structure of the\nclasses and the pedagogy employed were consistent throughout.\nTable III.

The lab was on collisions and momentum\ntransfer. During Fall 2004, the lab used metal ball bearings rolling down tracks and\ncolliding. In keeping with the modeling approach, students had created a model to\nexplain the situation and used the model to make predictions before the collisions, then\nthey collided the marble, and finally they used their findings to revise their model. Due\nto the lack of equipment students made visual observations and then recorded the\nobservations using motion maps for the two carts as data. The lab was very similar in Fall\n2005. Students made models on whiteboards, which they then used to generate\npredictions about the outcome of the collisions. The primary difference during Fall 2005\nwas the inclusion of the technology, instead of colliding ball bearings, students used\nPasco PasCarts and collected data using motion detectors. Laptop computers then\ninstantly displayed position vs. time and velocity vs. time graphs. Fall 2004\nThe ethnographer made comments that fell into two categories during Fall 2004. The first\ngroup of comments related to the difficulty of using tracks and ball bearings, citing\nproblems such as, \"the track was wobbly, and the balls don't stay together.\" The second\ngroup of comments related to making observations as a means for collecting data. One\nstudent reported she was, \"observing the force of the collisions,\" while another pointed\nout that they had made their predictions, but after trying to use the equipment, they had to\nsimplify their observations.\n\n\fFall 2005 Ethnography\nWhen the ethnographer returned in Fall 2005, the technology related comments were\nagain in two categories, but they were different than in Fall 2004. In the first category\nwere comments relating to difficulties with the technology such as, \"[there was]...some\ninitial difficulty getting the laptops set up for the experiment,\" and \"the students would\nnot be able to retrieve the data outside of class\". The second group of comments related\nto how the students were interacting with the data. She explained how one group was\nworking on understanding the results in terms of velocity of the two carts (one is negative\nand one is positive), and in another case that students described, \"using position over time\nto compute velocity, which was graphed on the laptop for each trial,\" they were able to\ngenerate predictions about the outcomes.\nNotable in these two groups of comments, is that for Fall 2005 the comments were not all\npositive about technology, there are barriers to overcome, many of which are unforeseen.\nHowever, the students were all able to overcome the barriers, and were able to complete\nthe lab activity. Also the ethnographer indicated in her notes that the lab lasted only an\nhour, whereas during Fall 2004, the lab lasted a full two hours. This indicates that the\ntechnology increased the efficiency of the class significantly even though the students\nwere engaged in the same type of activities.\n\nStudent Surveys\nThe final source of evidence for this study is the surveys students completed at the end of\nthe semester. The surveys were reviewed by the authors of this study, and each responses\nwere judged to be either favorable toward the inclusion of technology (F), unfavorable\ntoward the inclusion of technology (U), or neutral toward the inclusion of technology\n(N). All responses were tabulated, the overall results can be seen in Table IV, and\nspecific quotes which supported the general response patterns were collected.\nTable IV. Results from student survey on role of technology in physics class.\n\nFavorable\nUnfavorable\nNeutral\n\n2004\n20.4%\n27.9%\n51.7%\n\n2005\n76.0%\n5.0%\n19.0%\n\nResults from the 2004 survey showed ambivalence toward technology, students equally\nwished there were more technology and thought the technology was adequate. This is\nnot surprising, as these students had not experienced a technology-enhanced class, so\nwere unable to evaluate the benefits of the technology. Further these students were\npleased with their learning experience in the physics class and generally did not see how\n\n\ftechnology would have improved their experience. An example of this type of student\nresponse from 2004, \"I don't know the answer to this. I can't imagine the class any other\nway. I don't know how equipment could benefit us, because we learned so adequately\nwithout the equipment. The class was fine without the extra equipment!\"\n\n2005 Student Survey Results\nThe survey results during Fall 2005 were far more favorable toward the inclusion of\ntechnology. As can be seen in Table 4, the 2005 students saw the benefits of technology\nin the class. This is not to say they did not have some reservations, which primarily\nstemmed from technical difficulties with the computers, including lack of wireless,\ncomputers that froze at inopportune times and difficulties with setting up the labs. But\nthe overwhelming sentiment was that the computers improved the educational experience\nin important ways. One student described the role of the computers as essential in\nhelping to understand experiments and that the computers played a role in enhancing\ngroup interactions, saying, \"It was very effective in me understanding the experiments\nand results especially with the whole group looking at the results.\" Another student also\npointed to the efficiency that the computers added saying, \"I'm not sure that we could\nhave gotten the idea if we hadn't had the computers. It would have been too much time\nwasted if we hadn't had them.\"\n\nConclusions and discussion\nThis study exploited the clean experimental design of making only one systematic change\nto the instruction in introductory mechanics, and then collected three different forms of\ndata to substantiate the changes in student learning when real-time data collection and\nanalysis hardware and software was introduced. The data points to significant gains in\nleaning, and student responses to the inclusion of technology were very supportive. From\nthis, we attribute the gains in learning to the inclusion of the technology. This finding is\nsignificant, because it measures increases in learning across an entire class as result from\ninclusion of technology.\nHowever, the authors would not point to the technology as a panacea, instead the learning\ngains from the inclusion of technology are the result of technology being used in a way\nthat supports a student-centered, active engagement curriculum. It would not be expected\nthat a standard lecture-based mechanics course that switches from low-tech, traditional\nlabs to high-tech traditional labs would have the same increase in learning gains. Instead\nthese increases in learning exist because the student-centered pedagogy pre-dated the\ninclusion of the technology. Following are some ideas about the role of the technology in\nthe pedagogy, which lead to improved learning.\nThe first and most obvious difference between the classes is the efficiency of using\ntechnology to collect and represent data. Students in the technology-enhanced class have\ndata instantly represented for them, which allows them to focus immediately on the\n\n\finterpretation and analysis. Students lacking technology see a large time delay between\nconducting the investigation and beginning to interpret and analyze the data. Further, the\nlack of technology requires students to focus on creating the representations themselves,\nleaving them to question the accuracy of the representations. Students in the technology\nenhanced class were seen by the ethnographer discussing the meaning of the graphs while\nthey were still involved in making predictions, which indicates that these students were\nengaging in analysis and prediction instantly rather than waiting. This time delay from\nphenomena to representation and analysis seems significant and worthy of further study.\nThe efficiency factor comes into play in other ways as well, because the labs are much\nfaster, additional time is available. The additional time in this class was not dedicated to\ncovering greater quantities of material, but instead to further investigation of the concepts\nand added problem solving. This can be seen as the reason for greater learning, and it\nshould be. The technology can be used to help students achieve more by doing things that\ndo not add to student learning more quickly, thereby freeing up more time for the\nactivities that are important in learning.\nThe third factor in the role of technology in learning is how the technology is used to\nsupport active-engagement student-centered pedagogy. In this example, the students\nwere deeply engrossed in the modeling curriculum, which focuses on having students\nbuild models and to validate the models with evidence. Because the students were able to\nuse the technology to provide evidence, which reinforced the models they had developed,\nthe experience was valuable to their understanding. The students had seen the technology\nas a valuable tool for developing modeling phenomena, and the models as the essential\nknowledge construct for understanding physics.\nIn short, this study has made a measurement of the impact that technology can have on\nstudent learning. The impact is significant but will be realized when the technology is\nused as a tool to support active-engagement in the understanding of physics.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the National Science Foundation, this work is the direct\nresult of NSF-DUE #0411344.
