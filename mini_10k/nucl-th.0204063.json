The theoretical results reproduced the energy\nlevels of recently measured excited states of 12 Be, and also predicted rotational\nbands with innovative clustering structures in 12 Be, 14 Be and 15 B. Clustering\nstates with new exotic clusters (6 He, 8 He and 9 Li) were theoretically suggested. One new aspect in very neutron-rich nuclei is a 6-nucleon correlation\namong 4 neutrons and 2 protons, which plays an important role in the formation of 6 He clusters during clustering: 8 He+6 He of 14 Be and 9 Li+6 He of\n15 B.\n\nOwing to progress of experimental techniques, information concerning the excited states\nof light unstable nuclei has increased rapidly. Clustering structures should be one of the\nessential features in unstable nuclei as well as in stable nuclei. However, the characteristics\nof clustering in unstable nuclei are still mysterious. Do clustering structures often appear in\nthe excited states of general light unstable nuclei ? Searching for exotic clustering structures\nand other new-type clusters than the well-known \u03b1 cluster is the focus in studies of the\nexcited states of light unstable nuclei. The clustering structures of unstable nuclei are one\nof the attractive and important subjects in experimental and theoretical research.\nTheoretical studies on 10 Be [1,2,3,4,5] have suggested molecule-like structures in the\nK = 1\u2212 band and in the excited K = 0+\n2 band. Other candidates of clustering structures\n12\nare the excited states of Be observed recently in the inelastic scattering reactions [6] and\nin break-up reactions into 6 He+6 He and 8 He+4 He channels [7,8]. However, fully microscopic\ncalculations have not yet been done for these states of 12 Be. Another interesting feature of\n12\nBe is a vanishing of the neutron magic number N = 8 [9,10]. If the ground state is an\nintruder state, where are the normal states with closed neutron-shell configurations? It is\nimportant to solve the relation between the intruder ground state and the possible clustering\nstates within one microscopic framework in order to systematically investigate the structures\nof 12 Be. Our first aim is to study the ground and excited states of 12 Be with a microscopic\nmethod. Furthermore, it is a challenge to theoretically search light neutron-rich nuclei (14 Be\nand 15 B) for new clustering states with exotic clusters\nWe have applied a microscopic method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD).\nThe AMD methods have already proved to be a powerful approach for structure studies of\ngeneral light nuclei [5,11,12,13] because of the flexibility of the wave functions, which can\nexpress various kinds of structures from spherical shell-model-like structures to developed\n1\n\n\fclustering structures. It is possible to systematically investigate the ground and excited\nstates of light nuclei with a new version: a variation after spin-parity projections (VAP)\nof AMD, which was proposed by the author [12]. As for theoretical predictions with this\nmethod, the predicted 5\u2212 and 6+ states of 10 Be with developed clustering structures [5] have\nactually been discovered in recent experiments [8].\nIn the present work, we have studied the structures of the ground and excited states\n12\nof Be and compared the theoretical results with the experimental data. We theoretically\nsearched 14 Be and 15 B for unknown excited states with new clustering structures. In the\nresults for 14 Be and 15 B, the prediction of new rotational bands of exotic clustering structures\nare presented. We discuss the mechanism of clustering development and the origin of the\nformation of 6 He clusters.\nAn AMD wave function is a Slater determinant of Gaussian wave packets:\n\u03a6AM D =\n\n\u03c6i = \u03c6Zi \u03c7i \u03c4i :\n\n\u221a1 A{\u03c61 , \u03c62 , * * * , \u03c6A },\nA!\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03c6Zi (rj )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c7i\n\n=\n\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u221d exp \u2212\u03bd rj \u2212\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\n+ \u03bei\n\u2212 \u03bei\n\n!\n\n(1)\nZi\n\u221a\n\u03bd\n\n\u00132 #\n\n,\n(2)\n\n,\n\nwhere the centers of Gaussians Zi 's are complex variational parameters. \u03c7i is an intrinsic spin\nfunction parameterized by \u03bei , which is also a variational parameter specifying the direction\nof the intrinsic spin of the ith nucleon. \u03c4i is an isospin function which was fixed to be up\n(proton) or down (neutron) in the present calculations. We varied the parameters Zi and\n\u03bei (i = 1 \u223c A) to minimize the energy expectation value for the spin-parity eigenstate (VAP\ncalculations),\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nJ\nJ\nhPM\nK \u2032 \u03a6AM D |H|PM K \u2032 \u03a6AM D i\n,\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nJ\nJ\nhPM\nK \u2032 \u03a6AM D |PM K \u2032 \u03a6AM D i\n\n(3)\n\nJ\u2217\nJ\nd\u03a9DM\nwhere the operator of total-angular-momentum projection (PM\nK \u2032 (\u03a9)R(\u03a9).\nK \u2032 ) is\nThe integration for the Euler angle \u03a9 was calculated numerically. We adopted a frictional\ncooling method [11] to obtain the minimum energy states. Here, we represent the intrinsic\nAMD wave function as \u03a6J\u00b1\n0 , that was obtained by a VAP calculation for the lowest state with\n\u00b1\na given spin parity of J . Higher excited states were constructed by varying the energy of\nthe orthogonal components to the lower states by superposing wave functions. More details\nof the AMD method for the excited states with the variation after spin-parity projection\nare described in Refs [5,12]. By performing VAP calculations for the lowest and the higher\nexcited states with various sets of total spin and parity {J\u00b1}, we obtained many AMD\nwave functions {\u03a61 , * * * , \u03a6m }, each of which approximately represents the intrinsic state of\nthe corresponding Jn\u00b1 state. The final results were attained by diagonalizing a Hamiltonian\nJ\u00b1\nJ\u00b1\nmatrix, hPM\nK \u2032 \u03a6i |H|PM K \u2032\u2032 \u03a6j i (i, j = 1 \u223c m).\nWe applied the AMD method for the excited states of 12 Be, 14 Be and 15 B. The adopted\ninteractions in the present work were the central force of the modified Volkov No.1 with case\n3 [14], the spin-orbit force of G3RS [15] and the Coulomb force. The Majorana parameter\nused here was m = 0.65, and the strength of G3RS force was chosen to be u1 = \u2212u2 = 3700\n\nR\n\n2\n\n\fMeV. We choose an optimum width parameter (\u03bd) for the Gaussians of the single-particle\nwave functions of each nucleus.\nThe theoretical results of the binding energies of 12 Be, 14 Be and 15 B are 61.9 MeV,\n59.7 MeV and 73.1 MeV, which underestimate the experimental values: 68.65 MeV, 69.77\nMeV, 88.19 MeV, respectively. We find that the smaller values of the binding energies in\nthe present results than the experimental data can be improved by changing the Majorana\nparameter of the interaction small to be m = 0.61. With this parameter, the binding energy\nof 14 Be is 67.7 MeV. In spite of the smaller values of binding energies, we adopt the parameter\nm = 0.65 in the present work, because this parameter gives a good reproduction of parity\ninversion of 11 Be, which should be important to well describe the ground-state properties\nof neighboring nucleus: 12 Be. We have checked that the change of m parameter has no\n14\nsignificant effect on the excitation energy E(0+\nBe, at least. Namely, the calculated\n2 ) of\n+\nvalues of E(02 ) in the cases m = 0.61 and m = 0.65 are 4.2 MeV and 4.4 MeV, respectively.\nIn the calculated results for 12 Be with AMD, many excited states appear in the low-energy\n+\nregion. The energy levels of 12 Be are presented in Fig. 1. The theoretical levels of the 4+\n2 , 62\nand 8+\n1 states correspond well to the recently observed excited states [7]. By analyzing the\nintrinsic AMD wave functions, we can classify the excited states into rotational bands, such\n+ + \u2212\nas K \u03c0 = 0+\n1 , 02 , 03 , 11 . It is surprising that the newly observed levels [7] at an energy region\nabove 10 MeV belong to the third rotational band, K \u00b1 = 0+\n3 , which is a 2h\u0304\u03c9 excited state\nwith a well-developed clustering structure. On the other hand, there are many low-lying\n+\n\u03c0\npositive-parity states which belong to the lower rotational bands, K \u03c0 = 0+\n1 and K = 02 .\nEven though 12 Be has a neutron magic number of 8, the intrinsic state of the ground 0+\nstate is not an ordinary state with a closed neutron p-shell, but a prolately deformed state\nwith a developed clustering structure. The deformed ground state is dominated by another\n\u03c0\n+\n2p\u22122h configuration than that in the 0+\n3 state. As a result, the ground K = 0 band starts\n+\n+\nfrom the ground 0 state and reaches the band terminal at the 81 state. The rotational\n\u00b1\nbands, K \u00b1 = 0+\n= 0+\n3 and K\n1 , share the same band terminal state because the terminal\n+\n\u00b1\nJ = 81 state is the highest spin state in the 2h\u0304\u03c9 configurations. On the other hand, the\n+\nmain components of the 0+\n2 and 2 states are the 0h\u0304\u03c9 configuration with a closed neutron\np-shell, and construct the second K \u03c0 = 0+\n2 band.\n12\n+\nFor experimental evidence, the strength of the \u03b2 decay from 12 Be(0+\n1 ) to B(1 ) is helpful\nto estimate the breaking of the neutron p-shell [9]. As expected, the theoretical value of\nB(GT ) = 0.8 is sufficiently small as the experimental data, B(GT ) = 0.59, because the\ncomponent of the 2h\u0304\u03c9 configurations in the parent 12 Be(0+\n1 ) makes the transition matrix of\nthe Gamov-Teller operator to be small. Such a result is consistent with pioneer work [9,16],\nwhere their treatments were not fully microscopic for the freedom of all nucleons. The\n+\n2\n2\ncalculated value of B(E1) from 1\u2212\n1 to 01 is 0.02 e fm , which agrees reasonably with the\nexperimental large value, B(E1) = 0.05 e2 fm2 [10]. As for the E2 transition strength, the\n+\n+\n+\n2\n4\npredicted values in the present results are B(E2; 2+\n1 \u2192 01 ) = 14 e fm and B(E2; 22 \u2192 02 )\n= 8 e2 fm4 , which indicate a larger value of the E2 transition strength in the deformed\n+\nK = 0+\n1 band than that in the K = 02 band.\nIt should be pointed out that this is the first theoretical work which systematically\nreproduces the energy levels of all spin-assigned states discovered recently, except for the 1\u2212\nstate. Although the excitation energy of the 1\u2212 state is overestimated by theory, we regard\n\u2212\nthe theoretical 1\u2212\n1 state as being the measured 1 state at 2.68 MeV because of the large\n3\n\n\fExcitation Energy (MeV)\n\n(8+)\n\n20\n\n8+\n\n7+\n\n15\n\n6-\n\n6+\n\n(6+)\n\n+\n(4+) 5 4+ + +\n1\n0\n+\n6\n3+\n2+\n\n10\n\n5+\n4+ 2 1\n\n5\n+\n2\n+\n0\n\n0\n\n2+\n0+\n\nEXP\n\n4023-\n\n0+\n\nAMD\n\nFIG. 1.

A theoretical discovery in the present calculations is the K \u03c0 = 0+\n3 rotational\n+\n+\n+\nband with the developed 6 He+6 He clustering structure, which constructs the 0+\n3 , 23 , 42 , 62\n+\nand 8+\n1 states. The developed clustering in the 03 state gradually weakens with increasing\ntotal-angular momenta (J), and finally it changes to a spin-aligned state at J \u00b1 = 8+\n1 . Many\n+\n\u2212\nexcited states in the rotational bands K \u03c0 = 0+\n,\n0\nand\n1\nare\npredicted\nto\nexist\nin the\n1\n2\nlow-energy region with an excitation energy below 10 MeV.\nBy analyzing the single-particle wave functions in the intrinsic state, the deformation\nmechanism of the ground state can be understood by the idea of molecular orbits surrounding\n2\u03b1 cores. Although the molecular orbits in Be isotopes have been studied theoretically\n[1,3,4,17], one of the important points of the present results is that the development of a\n2\u03b1+4n structure in the ground state of 12 Be can be confirmed without assuming the existence\nof clusters. On the other hand, the third 0+ state seems to be a 6 He+6 He clustering structure\ninstead of the \u03b1 and surrounding neutrons in molecular orbits, because the distance between\ntwo clusters is too large. In this case, an \u03b1 cluster goes outward far enough to form a 6 He\ncluster with 2 valence neutrons.\nWe next present the results for 14 Be. Figure 2 shows the energy levels of positive-parity\nstates of 14 Be obtained by VAP calculations. Although few excited states are experimentally\nknown, many excited states are predicted based on the theoretical results. There are a few\ncandidates of levels above the threshold energy (9.1 MeV excitation) for separation into\n8\nHe+6 He in break-up experiments [18].\nThe excited states in the region J \u2264 6 are classified into 3 rotational bands: K = 0+\n1,\n+\n+\n14\nK = 02 and K = 2 . In most of the states in Be, 2-\u03b1 cores are formed in the calculated\nresults, although no clusters are assumed in the model.

Excitation energies of the levels in 14 Be calculated by VAP calculations based on AMD.\nThe excitation energies are plotted as a function of J(J + 1), where J is the total spin of the state.\n\nand 0+\n2 states have prolate deformations with deformation parameters of \u03b2 = 0.49 and\n\u03b2 = 0.64, respectively. The latter one with a large deformation constructs the K \u03c0 = 0+\n2\nstate.\nBy\nanalyzing\nthe\nsingle-particle\nwave\nfunctions\nrotational band, which reaches the 8+\n2\n+\nbands are\nof the intrinsic states, it is found that the states in the K = 0+\n1 and K = 2\ndominated by the normal 0h\u0304\u03c9 configurations, while the largely deformed states in K \u03c0 = 0+\n2\nmainly contain 4p-2h states with 2h\u0304\u03c9 configurations. The unique result of 14 Be is innovative\nclustering structures of the excited states in this second K \u03c0 = 0+\n2 band. The intrinsic states\n+\n\u03c0\n8\n6\nof K = 02 band have spatially developed He+ He clustering state, where both clusters\nare, themselves, very neutron-rich nuclei. In Figure 3(a) for the contour surface for the\n8\n6\nmatter density, \u03c1 \u2265 0.16 nucleons/fm3 , of the intrinsic state of the 0+\n2 state, the He( He)\ncluster can be clearly recognized in the right(left)-handed side.\nIn order to understand the origin of 8 He+6 He clustering formation, it is valuable to inspect the single-particle behavior of the valence neutrons. As mentioned above, the 8 He+6 He\nclustering state in the K \u03c0 = 0+\n2 band comes from the 4p-2h configurations. According to\nanalyses of the single-particle energies and wave functions, the highest 4 neutron orbits correspond to two kinds of spatial orbits, which are associated with the sd-mixing orbits in the\ndeformed system. Roughly speaking, each of two kinds of spatial orbits is occupied by a\nspin-up neutron and a spin-down neutron. Figures 3(b) and 3(c) present the higher sd-like\norbit and the lower sd-like orbit, respectively. They contain more than 80% components of\nthe positive parity states. If we call the longitudinal direction of the prolate deformation\nas the z-axis, the highest nucleon orbit seen in Fig. 3(b) originates from the sd-orbit with\na form of yz exp[\u2212\u03bdr 2 ]. On the other hand, the spatial orbit for the lower one is similar to\nthe orbit of z 2 exp[\u2212\u03bdr 2 ], which deforms along the z-axis, as shown in Fig.3(c). The original\nsd-orbits are modified because of the deformation in 14 Be. The deformed neutron orbits\nare stabilized by 2 stretched pairs of protons, because the orbits gain their kinetic energies\nwith respect to the nodes along the z-axis.

The density distributions for the single-particle orbits of the valence\nneutrons are presented in figures (b) and (c).\n6\n\nHe cluster in the 6 He+8 He clustering system consists of 4 neutrons in the sd-orbits and 2\nprotons in the p-orbits. In other words, the formation of 6 He cluster originates from the correlation of 4 neutrons in the sd-orbits and 2 protons in the p-orbits. Once a 6 He cluster takes\nshape, the cluster spatially develops out of the core-cluster 8 He keeping the stability of the\nmodified sd-mixing orbits in the deformed system. Unique points of this idea are as follows.\nFirstly, correlations of more than 4 nucleons have not been found. The 6 He cluster is related\nto 6-nucleon correlations (4 neutrons with 2 protons). Second, the nucleons, which compose\na cluster out of the core nucleus, rise over 2 shells (sd-shell and p-shell in this case). This is\nunusual in light stable nuclei. The third point is that the spatially clustering development\nis associated with the stability of the single-particle orbits of the system. We suggest one of\nthe novel feature that 4 neutrons with 2 protons correlate to form a developed 6 He cluster\nin neutron-rich nuclei.\nIn the results concerning the excited states of 15 B, the situation is similar to that of 14 Be.\nWe find an exotic clustering structure with 9 Li+6 He in the second K \u03c0 = 3/2\u2212\n2 band, which\nstarts from the J \u00b1 = 3/2\u2212\nstate\nat\nabout\n7\nMeV\nhigher\nthan\nthe\nground\nstate.\nThe intrinsic\n2\n\u2212\n9\n6\n\u03c0\nstructure of the K = 3/22 band consists of two exotic clusters: Li and He clusters, which\n14\nBe. These excited states with\ndevelop as remarkably as those in the K \u03c0 = 0+\n2 band of\n9\n6\nLi+ He clustering are based on 2h\u0304\u03c9 configurations. The spatial parts of 4 valence neutrons\nin sd-like orbits are very similar to those of 14 Be presented in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c). It is an\ninteresting problem whether or not the 6 He-cluster may appear in the excited states of other\nneutron-rich nuclei than 14 Be and 15 B.\n6\n\n\fAlthough particle decay widths are important for the stability of the excited states, the\nwidths were not considered in the present calculations, which were performed within a bound\nstate approximation. The widths for the particle decays should be carefully discussed using\nother frameworks, such as a method with a reduced width amplitude, or a complex scaling\nmethod beyond the present AMD framework. We just mention the partial widths of the\n14\nstates into He channels in the K \u03c0 = 0+\nBe. When the excitation energies are above the\n2 of\n14\nthreshold energy, 12.2 MeV, the excited states in K \u03c0 = 0+\nBe may decay into 8 He+6 He\n2 of\n8\n6\nchannel. By assuming He and He clusters in SU(3) limits, we estimated the partial decay\n+\n8\n+\n6\n+\nwidth of 6+\n2 and 82 into He(0 )+ He(0 ) channel to be 6 keV and 50 keV, respectively,\nby calculating the reduced width amplitude. For the total width, it is required to carefully\nstudy the excitation energies and other decay channels, such as neutron decays and excited\nHe cluster decays.\nIn summary, we studied the structure of the excited states of 12 Be, 14 Be and 15 B based\non the framework of the AMD method. This is the first microscopic calculation to systematically reproduce the energy levels of all the spin-assigned states in 12 Be, except for the 1\u2212\nstate. One of the discoveries of the present results is the third K \u03c0 = 0+ band with 6 He+6 He\nclusters, which corresponds well to recently observed states in the break-up reactions. In\n14\nBe and 15 Be, we predicted low-lying excited states with innovative clustering structures.\nNamely, new types of clusters, 8 He+6 He and 9 Li+6 He, were found in the excited states of\n14\nBe and 15 Be, respectively. In these well-developed clustering structures with 2h\u0304\u03c9 excited\nconfigurations, the mechanism of the 6 He cluster development was discussed in relation to\nthe single-particle picture. It was found that the 6-nucleon correlation among 4 neutrons\nand 2 protons plays an important role in the formation of 6 He cluster. The results suggest\nan important feature, that an exotic clustering structure may very often exist in the excited\nstates of neutron-rich nuclei.\nThe author would like to thank Prof. H.
