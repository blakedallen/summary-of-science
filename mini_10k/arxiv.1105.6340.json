The main question\nusually investigated is what type of transport emerges\nfrom microscopic laws, the two extreme cases being\nballistic or diffusive transport. Yet, such classification\nseems elusive, especially in the field of strongly correlated\nquantum systems. To nevertheless explain the emergence of macroscopic transport laws, phenomenological\napproaches, viable under certain assumptions, are often\nused. One such approach is based on the well-known\nkinetic theory of gases,1 devised by Boltzmann, where\nmacroscopic transport laws emerge due to (quasi)particle\nscattering. Also routinely used is linear-response theory,\nwhich gives a direct method of calculating transport coefficients using variants of Green-Kubo formulas,2 assuming local quasiequilibrium. Our approach here is different. Starting from the equations of motion (Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation or master equation) we use extensive numerical simulations to study transport in the one-dimensional\nHeisenberg model.\nLow-dimensional spin models have been studied from\nthe very beginning of quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg model, suggested3 by W. Heisenberg in 1928, was\ninitially proposed to explain a high phase transition temperature in ferromagnets that could not be accounted for\nby any other known direct interaction. Interaction between nearest neighbor atoms, described by the Heisenberg model, the so-called exchange interaction, is an effective one and comes about due to the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple. Another important source of motivation to\nstudy such simple one-dimensional (1D) models, in particular antiferromagnetic ones, comes due to the fact\nthat they represent simplest models of strongly correlated electronic systems, much studied in past decades.\nIn addition, one-dimensional spin systems are realized in\nreal so-called spin-chain materials.4,5 Experiments have\nshown, see e.g. Ref. 6, that 1D spin chains found in\n\nsuch materials, for instance the isotropic Heisenberg one,\nhave a pronounced effect on transport properties, giving\nadditional boost to theoretical studies. A great deal of\nresearch was devoted to the transport properties of the\nanisotropic Heisenberg model (XXZ model). Although it\nis one of the simplest 1D spin models, being even solvable\nby the Bethe ansatz,7 there are still many open questions\nconcerning its transport properties, including whether\nfinite-temperature spin transport is ballistic or diffusive.\nClassification of transport regimes was the main motivation for our work.\nLet us briefly review known facts about transport in\nthe 1D Heisenberg model; for more extensive reviews see\nRefs. 5, 8, and 9. As forementioned, one of the standard\napproaches for studying transport properties of quantum\nsystems is linear-response theory. Ballistic and diffusive\ntransport can be distinguished via an observation of the\nDrude weight, the prefactor of a \u03b4 function at zero frequency in the frequency-dependent transport coefficient.\nNonzero Drude weight signals ballistic transport in the\nlinear-response regime. The question of energy transport in the XXZ model is simple: energy current is a\nconserved quantity10,17 and therefore energy transport\nis ballistic. For the dependence of the thermal Drude\nweight on parameters, see Ref. 11 and references therein.\nIn the present work, we shall focus on magnetization\n(spin) transport, which is much less understood, with\nonly few rigorous results. It has been shown that the\nspin Drude weight is nonzero (i.e., magnetization transport is ballistic) at zero temperature12 in the gapless\nphase for \u2206 \u2264 1 as well as at infinite temperature13\nfor \u2206 < 1, where \u2206 is the anisotropy. It is reasonable\nto expect, and also supported by quantum Monte Carlo\ncalculations,14,15 that transport is ballistic also at finite\ntemperatures. On general grounds, a lot of attention\nhas been devoted to the connection between integrability and the nature of transport22 being either ballistic or\ndiffusive. A recent solvable diffusive model23 shows that\nsolvability does not necessarily imply ballistic transport.\nWhile the spin transport in the gapless phase is rel-\n\n\f2\natively well understood, the behavior at the isotropic\npoint \u2206 = 1 and in the gapped phase \u2206 > 1 is hotly\ndebated. The main difficulty is that numerically it is\nvery hard to access behavior in the thermodynamic limit,\nwhile there are only few analytical approaches. A notable one is in terms of Mazur's inequality16 , which can\nbe used to bound the Drude weight away from zero if\na conserved quantity exists that has a nonzero overlap\nwith the magnetization current.17 Unfortunately, in the\nhalf-filled case (zero total magnetization) and \u2206 > 1\nof interest here, no such quantity is known. Numerical methods like exact diagonalization18\u201320 or the Lanczos method21 are all limited to small systems of few\n10 spins, making thermodynamic extrapolation difficult.\nA relatively recent method is a time-dependent densitymatrix renormalization-group (tDMRG) procedure that\nenables simulation of 1D nearest-neighbor systems of several 100 spins. It has been used successfully to study the\nspreading of wavepackets in the XXZ model.24 Particularly useful is its master equation variant, where one has\na genuine nonequilibrium setting, enabling one to study\nalso far from equilibrium situations. It has been used\nto show a diffusive transport in the gapped phase at infinite temperature,25,26 which has been also confirmed\nusing correlation functions27 and the projector operator\nmethod.28 Analytical studies of the master equation describing nonequilibrium XXZ model in the gapped phase\nfrequently have difficulties. One problem is that perturbative treatments often have zero convergence radius in\nthe thermodynamic limit, for instance, a perturbative series in the coupling to the reservoirs13 for \u2206 \u2265 1 or a perturbative series26 in \u2206, or they have a finite convergence\nradius but are difficult to obtain in the thermodynamic\nlimit, as is the case for large \u2206 in the gapped phase.26\nPerturbative studies in 1/\u2206 suggest that the diffusion\nconstant decreases as \u2206 increases.26,29\nBecause most spin-chain materials realize the isotropic\nHeisenberg model, the point \u2206 = 1 is of particular interest. It is also the most controversial one. Analytical\nBethe ansatz calculations give contradictory results, indicating zero31 or a nonzero Drude weight,32 with the\nproblem being how to properly account for all states\nimportant at a nonzero temperature. Quantum Monte\nCarlo calculations,14,15 bosonization,33 and exact diagonalization5,20,34 predict a nonzero Drude weight at finite temperatures for \u2206 = 1. Based on bosonization35\nand numerically calculated current autocorrelation function using a tDMRG method, a zero (or small) Drude\nweight at nonzero temperature is advocated in Refs. 36\nand 37, whose results are also supported by quantum\nMonte Carlo calculation in Ref. 30. A recent result,26 on\nthe other hand predicts anomalous magnetization transport at infinite temperature\n\u221a and \u2206 = 1, with the diffusion\nconstant diverging as \u223c L with the system size.\nAn interesting future possibility to study 1D strongly\ncorrelated systems is via controlled experiments with cold\natoms. Experimental quantum optical techniques have\nadvanced to the point where it is possible to realize such\n\nmodels in a controlled environment of optical latices or\nion traps. An advantage of such an approach is that\none can choose the values of system's parameters at will.\nFirst realizations of exchange interaction or of simple spin\nsystems have already been achieved.38\n\nThe main goal of the present paper is to study the\nmagnetization transport at finite temperatures in the\ngapped phase of the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg\nmodel. Two numerical approaches, both based on the\ntDMRG method, will be used: one is based on observation of time evolution of magnetization profiles for initial\nnonequilibrium pure states, while the second one is based\non studying the magnetization current in the nonequilibrium steady state of an open quantum system described\nby a quantum master equation. By the first method,\nwe could, in principle, discriminate between the ballistic or diffusive behavior by comparing the evolution of\nexpectation values of magnetization (z-spin component\nat each chain site) to that expected from macroscopic\ntransport laws, provided we would be able to simulate\nvery long chains for a very long time. Unfortunately,\nthis is not the case and the results for pure state evolution are rather inconclusive, showing a mixture of ballistic and diffusive characteristics. In the master equation\napproach though, performed at higher energy densities,\none can give a quantitative prediction about the transport by studying the scaling of the magnetization current with the system size at a fixed driving. The two\nmethods work best in the complementary temperature\nregimes. The one for pure states is best at low temperatures, where a state only locally deviates from the\nground state and its entanglement is small, while the\nmaster equation simulation with density matrices works\nbest at high temperatures where the operator-space entanglement of a density matrix is small. Both methods\nhave been used before to study the magnetization transport in the XXZ model, pure-state method in Ref. 24 and\nmaster equation in Ref. 25, however not in the temperature regime considered in the present paper. We also\npoint out that with a pure-state evolution at very low\ntemperatures one is not able to access the asymptotic\ntransport regime with present computers, so some care\nhas to be taken making statements about the transport.\n\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II\nthe Heisenberg XXZ model is defined and the tDMRG\nmethod for evolution of pure and mixed states is briefly\ndescribed. In Sec. III, main results concerning transport\nproperties are presented, with the analysis of the evolution of pure initial Gaussian-shaped states in Sec. III B,\nand the results from the master equation setting in\nSec. III C. In Sec. IV the results of the evolution of domain wall-states are presented.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nMODEL AND METHODS\nA.\n\nModel\n\nA one-dimensional Heisenberg XXZ model is defined\nby the Hamiltonian\nH=J\n\nL\u22121\nX\u0014\nl=1\n\n\u0015\n\n1 + \u2212\nz\n(S S\n+ H.c.) + \u2206Slz Sl+1\n,\n2 l l+1\n\n(1)\n\nwith spin-1/2 operators Slx , Sly , Slz for l-th position on\nchain, and Sl\u00b1 = Slx \u00b1 iSly is spin raising/lowering operator. The spin chain is composed of L spins. Coupling\nstrength will be fixed at J = 1, and open boundary conditions will be used. \u2206 is the only remaining parameter\nand determines the anisotropy of the model.\nThe above model, written in the spin language, can\nbe transformed to a model of spinless fermions using the\nJordan-Wigner transformation,44 resulting in a Hamiltonian\nL\u22121\nX\u0014\n\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1 \u2020\n(c cl+1 + H.c.) + \u2206(nl \u2212 )(nl+1 \u2212 ) ,\nH=J\n2 l\n2\n2\nl=1\n(2)\nwhere cl , c\u2020l are standard fermionic annihilation/creation\noperators, while nl = c\u2020l cl . Magnetization (spin) transport in a spin chain given by Eq. (1) is thus equivalent\nto a transport of particles in Eq. (2). Expectation value\nof Slz is directly linked to fermionic particle density as\nnl = Slz + 1/2. Both descriptions can therefore be used\nPL\nz\ninterchangeably. Total magnetization M =\nl=1 hSl i\nis conserved quantity in the XXZ model; in fermionic\npicture, it corresponds to the conservation of the total\nPL\nnumber of particles, n = l=1 nl .\n\nB.\n\nMethods\n\nWe have used two closely related variants of the\ntime-dependent density-matrix renormalization-group\n(tDMRG) method: one for the evolution of pure quantum states and another for the evolution of a density\nmatrix describing a system coupled to reservoirs. Both\nmethods are based on writing expansion coefficients of\na state in terms of products of matrices, the so-called\nmatrix product state (MPS) ansatz for pure states and\nmatrix product operator (MPO) ansatz for density matrices. In the following, we will only briefly overview the\ntDMRG method. For a more complete presentation see\noriginal references.45\nFor the determination of a profile evolution from a\ngiven initial state, a time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation has to be solved,\ni\n\n\u2202\n|\u03c8i = H |\u03c8i .\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nState vector |\u03c8i, spanned by the tensor product of local\nHilbert spaces for each site, can be written as\nX\n|\u03c8i =\ncs |si ,\n(4)\ns\n\nwhere s enumerates all basis vectors of the Hilbert space\ns = (s1 , . . . , sL ) with sl \u2208 {0, 1} for the spin-down/up\nstates. The dimension of Hilbert space for the spin chain\nof length L is 2L . Solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation using\nexact diagonalization is thus possible only for very small\nsystems. However, it turns out that often not the whole\nHilbert space is relevant for the solution and much larger\nsystems can be solved by a clever choice of basis vectors,\nfor instance, as is done in the tDMRG method. In MPS\nformulation, expansion coefficients cs are expressed as\ntraces of product of L matrices Asl l , l = 1, . . . , L, of\ndimension K \u00d7 K,\ncs = tr(As11 * * * AsLl ).\n\n(5)\n\nTime evolution of the system is therefore described by\ntime-dependent matrices Asl l (t), which can be efficiently\ncalculated if the propagator U (t) = exp (\u2212iHt) can be\nfactorized into a product of unitaries that act only on two\nnearest-neighbor sites of a chain. This can be approximately done for short time-step propagation U (\u03c4 ) using\nSuzuki-Trotter expansion. The system Hamiltonian is\nseparated into two parts, H = H1 + H2 , where all terms\ngrouped inside each H1 and H2 mutually commute. Gen46\neral\nas U (\u03c4 ) =\nQ Suzuki-Trotter expansion can be written\np+1\nexp(\u2212i\u03b1\nH\n\u03c4\n)\nexp(\u2212i\u03b2\nH\n\u03c4\n)\n+\nO(\u03c4\n),\nwhere\nthe\nk\n1\nk\n2\nk\norder p depends on the actual scheme used. The O(\u03c4 p+1 )\ncontribution gives rise to Suzuki-Trotter error, which can\nbe reduced by either using expansions of higher order\n(having larger p) or reducing the step size \u03c4 . After each\ntime step, the MPS form of the state has to be restored\nusing the SVD algorithm. In the process the matrices\nAsl l are enlarged and to prevent an exponential growth\nof their dimension they must be truncated back to dimension K. This produces a truncation error \u000ftrunc which depends on the entanglement of the state being described.\nA cumulative truncation error due to truncations at each\ntime step can serve as a very rough estimate of the precision. A more robust method to check accuracy though\nis to simply increase K and check that the results do\nnot change. By using imaginary time step \u03c4 \u2192 i\u03c4 , the\ntDMRG method can also be used for obtaining a ground\nstate of a given Hamiltonian.\nThe tDMRG method for evolution of pure-states can\nbe extended to the evolution of mixed states by introducing a 4L -dimensional Hilbert space of operators, with\narbitrary operator given by\nX\n|\u03c1i =\ncs |\u03c3 s i ,\n(6)\ns\n\nsL\nwhere \u03c3 s = \u03c31s1 * * * \u03c3L\n, s = (s1 , . . . , sL ), and sl \u2208\n0\n{0, 1, 2, 3}, with \u03c3 = 1, \u03c3 1 = \u03c3 x , \u03c3 2 = \u03c3 y , \u03c3 3 = \u03c3 z ,\n\n\f4\n\nIII.\n\nTRANSPORT PROPERTIES\n\nThe main goal is to study magnetization transport in\nthe Heisenberg model at low energies, particularly for\n\u2206 > 1, where magnetization transport looks diffusive at\nan infinite temperature.25\u201327 We shall use two methods,\none will be spreading of localized packets and the other\nthe dependence of the spin current on the system size in\nthe stationary nonequilibrium state of a chain coupled to\ndifferent reservoirs at chain ends. It is useful to have a\n\"thermometer\" with which we will be able to determine\nthe temperature to which respective simulations correspond. In the thermodynamic limit of stationary states\nof a master equation under weak driving the state is in a\nlocal quasiequilibrium and the temperature is a well defined concept. In the wavepacket simulations though, in\nwhich packets are initially far from equilibrium, we prefer to speak about energy density instead, as there is no\nlocal quasi-equilibrium and the temperature is not well\ndefined. Another important scale in the gapped regime\nof \u2206 > 1 is the size of the energy gap between the ground\nand the first excited state.\nIn this section, we shall therefore first establish the values of the ground-state energy, the gap, and the relation\nbetween temperature and the energy density for the XXZ\nHeisenberg model, in particular for \u2206 = 1.5 used later.\nNext, we shall present the results for the wave-packet\nsimulations, followed by master-equation results.\n\nA.\n\nGround state energy, the gap, and the\ntemperature\n\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2\nET\n\nwhile lower indices denote a site along a chain. Following the reasoning of the MPS formulation for pure state\nevolution, coefficients cs can be written in a MPO form,\nanalogous to the MPS ansatz in Eq. (5), with sl enumerating the basis of single-site density operators. The time\nevolution of density matrix \u03c1 is governed by the Lindblad equation, with a formal solution \u03c1(t) = exp(L\u0302t)\u03c1(0),\nwhere L\u0302 is a Liouvillian superoperator. Thus the propagator for time step \u03c4 can be again factorized as a product of local propagators using Suzuki-Trotter expansion,\nproviding an efficient numerical scheme for the time evolution of a density operator. Because L\u0302 also contains\ndissipative terms due to a coupling with reservoirs, some\ncare must be taken to ensure that one has a Schmidtdecomposed form of MPO at each step. Details of our\nimplementation can be found in the appendix of Ref. 47.\nIn the simulations of pure states, the Suzuki-Trotter\nexpansion of second order was used (p = 2), mostly with\nthe time step of size \u03c4 = 0.05. The dimensions of the\ndecomposition K were chosen such that the truncation\nerror on each time step during the evolution did not exceed \u000ftrunc = 10\u22124 (required dimensions of decomposition\nK were of the order of \u223c 100). For master-equation simulations a fourth-order method with a time step \u03c4 = 0.05\nhas been used. The results were also verified by repeating simulations at somewhat higher decomposition sizes\nK and smaller time steps, showing no deviation in results.\n\n-0.3\nT\u22480.74\nT\u22480.58\n\n-0.4\n-0.5\n\nT\u22480.17\n\n-0.6\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\nT\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1. Dependence of the canonical energy density ET (9)\non the temperature for the anisotropic Heisenberg model,\n\u2206 = 1.5, and open boundary conditions. Curves are for\nL = 8, 16, 32, 64, bottom to top, while horizontal lines denote the average energy densities of Gaussian packets we use\nto study transport (note that all are much higher than the\ngap).\n\nIn order to be able to estimate where in the energy spectrum our initial states are, we have calculated\nthe ground-state energy of the anisotropic Heisenberg\nmodel,39 the size of the gap, and for both quantities also\nfinite-size corrections. Using numerically exact diagonalization for small sizes and an imaginary-time tDMRG\nfor longer chains (up to L = 64), we have determined\nby fitting that for anisotropy \u2206 = 1.5 and open boundary conditions the energy density h0 in the ground-state\n(which is always from the sector with M = 0) is\nh0 =\n\nhHi\n0.29\n\u2248 \u22120.5234 \u2212\n.\nL\u22121\nL\u22121\n\n(7)\n\nHere hHi is the expectation value in the ground state\nof H. Finite-size correction to the asymptotic energy\ndensity is therefore of the order O(1/L). At L = 200,\nused in our simulations, the ground-state energy density is h0 \u2248 \u22120.5247. Interesting to note is that\nfor periodic boundary conditions finite size correction\nis smaller, namely, the ground-state energy density is\nhPBC\n\u2248 \u22120.5234\u22120.89/L2 . The gap between the ground\n0\nstate and the first excited state (within the same symmetry class) is for \u2206 = 1.5 and open boundary conditions\nE1 \u2212 E0 \u2248 0.068 +\n\n7\n.\nL\n\n(8)\n\nFor a chain of length L = 200 the gap is E1 \u2212E0 \u2248 0.102.\nAs we shall see, the energies of our initial conditions will\nalways be significantly above the ground state gap. At\n\n\f5\nthe energy scale below the gap, transport is trivially insulating and we are not interested in this regime. We have\nalso calculated the relation between the thermodynamic\ntemperature and the energy density ET in a canonical\nstate,\nET =\n\ntr(\u03c1T H)\n,\nL\u22121\n\n\u03c1T =\n\nexp (\u2212H/T )\n.\ntr exp (\u2212H/T )\n\n(9)\n\nResults are in Fig. 1. Such relation can be used as a\n\"thermometer\"40 : for a given local energy density El ,\none can determine to what thermodynamic temperature\nthis corresponds by equating El = ET and solving for\nthe temperature T . One should be aware though that\nthe validity of the canonical distribution is by no means\ngranted for integrable systems. In fact, for specially chosen local reservoirs within the Lindblad master equation,\ndeviations from the canonical distribution can be significant for integrable systems;40 for discussion of open systems with general nonlocal coupling to reservoirs, see,\ne.g., Ref. 41.\nB.\n\nLocalized packets\n\nOne way to study transport is to initiate a spin chain\nin an initial state that is nonequilibrium with respect to\nthe Hamitonian generating time evolution only in a small\nlocalized region. In other words, one prepares a localized\ninitial packet and then studies how such a packet spreads\nin time. To obtain a state that is out of equilibrium\nonly in a small region of space, we put the chain into a\nspatially inhomogeneous external magnetic field Bl and\nuse the ground state of such a system as an initial state\nfor our evolution.\n1.\n\nPreparation of initial states\n\nTo prepare the initial state we take the Hamiltonian\nH0 = H +\n\nL\nX\n\nSlz Bl ,\n\n(10)\n\nl=1\n\nwhere H is the XXZ model Hamiltonian from Eq. (1).\nFor such Hamiltonian, the ground state |\u03c80 i was obtained\nusing imaginary-time tDMRG method. At time t = 0\nthe magnetic field is then removed and the initial state\nevolves according to H. The actual spatial dependence\nof Bl must be chosen in such way that time evolution of\nmagnetization enables us to distinguish between ballistic\nand diffusive behavior. Its detailed form will be given\nfurther on a per-case basis.\nFermionic nature of the antiferromagnetic ground state\nof the XXZ model leads to Friedel oscillations in magnetization profile hSlz i which get more pronounced when\neither effective interaction between fermions (\u2206) or magnetic disturbance for obtaining initial state gets larger.\n\nFriedel oscillations have a characteristic wavelength of\n2\u03c0/(2kF ), where kF = \u03c0/2. As intensity of these oscillations can blur the effective magnetization profile, simple\naveraging over two neighboring sites was used in the maz\njority of calculations, S\u0303lz = (hSl\u22121\ni + hSlz i)/2, similar to\nRef. 24. The same averaging was also used for the energy\ndensity profiles \u1ebcl = (hEl\u22121 i + hEl i)/2, where the energy\n\u2212\nz\ndensity operator is El = 12 (Sl+ Sl+1\n+ H.c.) + \u2206Slz Sl+1\n.\nSpatial dependence of the initial external magnetic\nfield for the Gaussian-shaped initial profiles is given by\nBl = Be\n\n\u2212\n\n[l\u2212(L+1)/2]2\n2\u03c3 2\nB\n\n\u2212 B0 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere B determines the intensity of an initial disturbance, \u03c3B its width and B0 an overall offset of magnetic\nfield that is used to adjust the total magnetization M of\nspin chain.\n2.\n\nEvolution of magnetization profiles\n\nInstead of focusing on the growth of the packet's variance with time, as for instance in Ref. 24, we focus on\nthe evolution of the whole magnetization profile.52 The\nreason is that, in the variance one can get spurious effects\nas we shall discuss at the end of this subsection in III B 4.\nIn this section, we always take \u2206 = 1.5. We first pick a\nmoderate B = 2, packet width \u03c3B = 5 and a compensating magnetic field B0 = \u22120.18, resulting in an initial\nstate with M = 0. In Fig. 2, we show a density plot\nshowing local magnetization along the chain for times up\nto t = 50. At few time slices, we also show magnetization\nprofiles. Two similar plots are also shown for the energy\ndensity. The energy E = h\u03c80 |H|\u03c80 i of the initial state\n|\u03c80 i is about 1.8 above the energy of the ground state,\nwhich is much more than the value of the gap that is\nE1 \u2212 E0 \u2248 0.1. The average energy density of our state\nis h = E/(L \u2212 1) = \u22120.516. In equilibrium, this would\ncorrespond to the canonical expectation at the temperature T \u2248 0.17; see also Fig. 1. Note that we do not\nmake any claim that the state is in or is close to being\nin local equilibrium, in which case one could use a local\ntemperature. From the profile plots we can see that the\ntwo bumps, moving away symmetrically from the origin,\nspread ballistically. In the density plots these are visible\nas ballistic jets. The speed of the wave front is almost the\nsame for the energy and magnetization spreading. Based\non these results one would be tempted to conclude that\nthe transport is ballistic. However, one should be aware\nthat the statement about transport is an asymptotic one,\nthat is, for long times. In relatively small chains available (L = 200) it could well happen that we have not\nyet reached this asymptotic regime. In fact, looking at\nthe magnetization profiles one can see that there is some\nnontrivial dynamics going on in the region between the\nbumps, and that the bumps change shape and height\nwith time. Also, one can argue on general ground that\nthe short-time dynamics for generic models is always bal-\n\n\f6\nior might be very large for the small-energy wavepackets\nshown in Fig. 2.\n\nt\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n(a.ii)\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\n50\n\n100\n\nl\n\n150\n\n200\n\nS\u0303lz\n\n0.15\n0.12\n0.10\n0.07\n0.05\n0.03\n0.00\n-0.03\n-0.05\n\n0.5\n(a.i)\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.2\n50\n\n0.48\n0.40\n0.32\n0.24\n0.16\n0.08\n0.00\n-0.08\n\n40\n\nt\n\nS\u0303lz\n\n0.30\n(a.i)\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n\u22120.05\n50\n\n30\n20\n10\n\n(b.i)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nl\n\n150\n\n200\n\n\u1ebcl\n\n\u22120.3\n\n(a.ii)\n\n\u22120.4\n\nt\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n\n(b.ii)\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nl\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFIG. 2.

There is strong numerical support\nthat the spin transport at an infinite temperature is\ndiffusive.25\u201327 The ballistic spreading of jets at low energies, seen in Fig. 2, should therefore weaken, for instance, slow down, or even entirely disappear, if the\ntransition time to diffusive behavior gets short enough\n\n\f7\n\nAll these simulations of the spreading of localized packets of magnetization show signs of ballistic spreading, either in terms of ballistic jets, or ballistically propagating\nwavefronts. One should be careful though about concluding that the transport is also ballistic at large times and\nin the thermodynamic limit, as these features could exhibit a nontrivial long-time behavior. As mentioned before, there could be a large time scale \u03c4diff , so that only for\ntimes larger than \u03c4diff transport starts to show purely diffusive character. One can in fact connect this time scale\nwith the diffusion constant D.

To verify this hypothesis we have\nsimulated packets at higher energies by simply increasing the amplitude B and the width \u03c3B of the initial\nmagnetic field. Note that in this way we also produce\nstates that are more strongly nonequilibrium, at least\nfor short times. In Fig. 3 we used B = 5 and \u03c3 = 10\n(B0 = \u22120.86) to prepare the initial state in a sector with\nzero total magnetization. The energy density of such\nan initial state is h = \u22120.406 and is therefore significantly above the ground state (\u2248 240 times the gap).\nThis energy density would in equilibrium correspond to\ntemperature T \u2248 0.58. We can see from the results in\nFig. 3 that the wavepacket front still spreads ballistically.\nThere is one important difference though compared to\nthe smaller-energy packet from Fig. 2: the speed of the\nmagnetization front is smaller, while the speed of the energy front is unchanged. Taking an even higher energy\npacket, obtained by B = 5 and \u03c3B = 15 (B0 = \u22121.21),\nthe speed of the magnetization front decreases even more.\nResults for such a packet having an average energy density h \u2248 \u22120.352 (which would correspond to temperature\nT \u2248 0.74) are in Fig. 4. From the spreading of packets at\nhigher energies, several things can be concluded. First, in\nthe regime of times and distances studied there is still a\nballistic front in the magnetization that spreads at a constant speed. This speed decreases as one increases the energy, as it should in order to accommodate for a diffusive\nbehavior at an infinite temperature. What happens with\nthe front at larger times, for which one would need larger\nsystems, is hard to infer. For the packet with the energy\ndensity h = \u22120.516 (Fig. 2), the speed is v \u2248 1.53, for\nthe packet with the average energy density h \u2248 \u22120.406\n(Fig. 3), the speed is v \u2248 0.77, and for the packet with\nh \u2248 \u22120.352 (Fig. 4), the speed is v \u2248 0.55. The second observation is that the speed of energy spreading\nis different than the speed of magnetization spreading.\nThe speed of the energy front is always approximately\nvE \u2248 1.55, which is incidentally also equal to the speed\nof magnetization spreading at low energies51 . Note that\nthe energy transport is ballistic in the Heisenberg model\nbecause the energy current is a conserved quantity. The\nthird observation, especially visible in the spreading of\nthe energy density in Fig. 4, is that there is an energy\ndispersion. The shape of the energy packet changes with\ntime. Parts with higher energy are \"overtaken\" by lowerenergy excitations, visible as the stretching of the energydensity profile in front of the main peak.\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n(b.ii)\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nl\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFIG. 4.

Therefore, if one has a diffusive behavior with a\ndiffusion constant D, this introduces a characteristic diffusive time scaling as \u03c4diff \u223c D. If diffusion constant D\nis very large (we shall see that this is likely the case), one\ncan have different behavior than the asymptotic diffusive\none for t \u001c \u03c4diff .

To distinguish the two, one would have to look at the spreading of\nvery wide and very shallow packets at long times, so that\nlocal deviations from equilibrium are small. Because with\ntDMRG one is limited to chains of few 100 spins this limit\ncan not be attained with the present computational resources. To nevertheless be able to say something about\nthe spin transport in the anisotropic Heisenberg model\nat low energies, we also performed tDMRG simulations\nof transport in the master equation setting, where we\ncan simulate systems at higher energies and some of the\nabove mentioned problems do not appear.\nBefore doing that, we shall briefly present two interesting observations about the spreading of localized packets\nthat are not directly related to transport.

Remember that B0 is used to tune the\nvalue of the total magnetization while retaining approximately Gaussian shape of the initial magnetization profile.

Time dependence of spin profile variance \u03c3 2 (t) \u2212 \u03c302\nfor initial states obtained with B = 2, \u03c3B = 2 and total\nmagnetization M = 0, and M = 2 (time evolution of corresponding profiles is shown on Figs. 2 and 6). Dotted line\nrepresents function at2 fitted to the variance of M = 2 case,\ndemonstrating ballistic growth. The M = 0 case on the other\nhand does not have simple time dependence of variance on\nattainable time scales.\n\nFor states of nonzero magnetization, M 6= 0, ballistic behavior was predicted on the basis of Mazur's inequality as\nthe spin current operator has a nonzero overlap with the\nconserved quantities of XXZ Hamiltonian.17 For M = 0\nthis overlap is zero and no conclusion can be made, thus\nleaving the possibility of a diffusive transport. We generated initial states by two alternative choices of initial\nmagnetic-field parameters B and B0 . In the first case, total magnetization of the initial states was tuned to M = 0\nby using an appropriate compensating magnetic field B0 .\nIn the second case, initial states were generated without\na compensating magnetic field, B0 = 0, thus resulting in\na nonzero (but small) total magnetization M 6= 0. As\nsystem size approaches thermodynamical limit L \u2192 \u221e,\nthere is no difference between the initial states generated\nby the above alternative choices of B0 because B0 \u2192 0.\nYet, for the attainable system sizes L \u223c 200 used in\nthe numerical simulations, the details of the initial state\npreparation can have an observable effect on the dynamics. In the following we define the variance of the spin\nprofile \u03c3 2 (t) and summarize our observations about the\ninfluence of the initial state preparation on the variance\nand overall evolution.\nTime dependence of variance, defined in the fermionic\npicture of the XXZ model as\n\u03c32 =\n\n1\nn\n\nL\nX\nl=1\n\n(l \u2212 \u03bc)2 * hnl (t)i ,\n\n\u03bc=\n\n1\nn\n\nL\nX\nl=1\n\nl hnl (t)i , (12)\n\nwas extensively studied in Ref. 24. There, a ballistic\nspreading was established for \u2206 \u2264 1, while for \u2206 & 1.5\nand M = 0 a diffusive transport was advocated based on\nlinear growth of \u03c3 2 at intermediate times. For M 6= 0\nit was shown24 that one gets \u03c3 2 \u223c t2 . Linear growth of\nvariance in the case of diffusive transport follows from the\n\nmacroscopic diffusion law for magnetization transport,\n\u2202 S\u0303 z (l)/\u2202t = \u2212D\u2202 2 S\u0303 z (l)/\u2202l2 . We were able to confirm\nthe ballistic growth of variance for \u2206 < 1. For \u2206 > 1, the\nsituation is more complex. Depending on the details of\nthe preparation of the initial state, more complex dynamics emerges, which can result in a linear variance growth\nfor intermediate times52 (see Fig. 7 at t \u2248 10 \u2212 25). The\nactual shape of the central magnetization packet though\ndoes not follow the behavior that is expected from the\nmacroscopic diffusion equation as can be seen in Fig. 2.\nWhile in the case of \u2206 < 1 the details of the initial\nstate preparation do not have pronounced effects on the\nevolution (either by observing \u03c3 2 (t) or the profile directly,\nboth show a ballistic behavior), the effects are stronger\nin the case of \u2206 > 1. For states with B0 = 0 (Fig. 6)\nthe profile evolution as well as the time dependence of\nthe variance (Fig. 7) seem purely ballistic, at least at attainable time scales. For the M = 0 states on the other\nhand, while the profile evolution still contains ballistic\nfeatures (Fig. 2), the variance does not grow as \u03c3 2 \u221d t2\nbut instead has a nontrivial time dependence. While this\nnonballistic growth of variance may be taken as a hint of\ntransition to a diffusive behavior, a detailed analysis of\nspin profiles reveals that observed behavior can be attributed to the negative magnetization \"bumps\" on the\nouter edges of spreading disturbance as seen on Fig. 2 for\ntimes t > 30. As the value of the variance \u03c3 2 (t) strongly\ndepends on the profile values further away from the middle of the chain, such bumps have a strong impact on the\nvariance. The occurrence of the bumps in the profile can\nbe attributed to the emergence of a nonequilibrium magnetization plateau in the central region of the chain, between the packets traveling in opposite directions. Due to\nthe conservation of total magnetization M , this nonequilibrium plateau of magnetization is compensated by an\nopposite deviation of magnetization on the edge of disturbance. Variance of the profile therefore should not be\ntaken as a sole criteria for the determination of transport\nregime. Thus we have focused mainly on the speed and\nthe behavior of spin-profile wave fronts, emerging from\nthe central peak, as these appear to be less dependent\non the details of the initial state preparation. Note that\nwe avoid making any definitive statement about the nature of transport from the wave-packet evolution only.\nThese simulations will serve us only as a guide to master\nequation simulations that we present next.\nC.\n\nMaster equation setting\n\nTo induce a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) we\ncouple our spin chain to reservoirs. The coupling is described in an effective way via a set of Lindblad operators acting on the first two and the last two spins. The\nLindblad master equation describing the evolution of the\ndensity matrix is42,43\nd\n\u03c1 = i[\u03c1, H] + Ldis (\u03c1) = L(\u03c1),\ndt\n\n(13)\n\n\f10\n40\n\nwhere the dissipative linear operator Ldis is expressed in\nterms of Lindblad operators Lk ,\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n[Lk \u03c1, L\u2020k ] + [Lk , \u03c1L\u2020k ] .\n(14)\nLdis (\u03c1) =\n\n2.7\n\n1.3\n\n0.82\n\n-0.227\n\n-0.32\n\nT\nh\n\nD\n\n10\n\nk\n\n10\n1\n\nD\n\nTo induce a NESS at a finite temperature we use Lindblad operators that couple to the first and last two\nspins of the chain \u2013 the so-called two-spin bath. Details of the two-spin bath implementation can be found\nin Refs. 25 and 47. There are therefore 16 Lindblad\noperators Lk at each end. They are chosen in such\na way that they would induce a grandcanonical state\n\u223c exp (\u2212H/TL,R + \u03bcL,R M ) on these two spins in the absence of Hamiltonian evolution by H. Because in our case\nthe evolution by H is present it introduces some boundary resistance effects that also affect the efficiency of the\nmethod. Due to these boundary effects it is rather difficult to cool the chain to very low temperatures40 . We\nuse reservoirs with the same temperature TL at the left\nand TR on the right end of the chain, while the chemical\npotential is \u03bcL = 0.1 at the left and \u03bcR = \u22120.1 at the\nright end. Because of this symmetric driving the average\nmagnetization in the NESS is zero, as is also the energy current. To calculate \u03c1(t), and therefore also NESS\ngiven by limt\u2192\u221e \u03c1(t), we use the tDMRG method with\na matrix product operator ansatz. After long time \u03c1(t)\nconverges to a stationary nonequilibrium state whose expectation values then give us transport properties. Due\nto boundary resistance the temperature in the bulk of the\nchain is not the same as the imposed temperature of the\n\"reservoir\" Lindblad operators. To determine the actual\ntemperature in the system in the nonequilibrium steady\nstate we use the expectation value of the energy density as a \"thermometer\",40 equating it to the canonical\none, and thereby determining the effective temperature,\nas described at the beginning of this section.\nBecause one has to simulate evolution of density operators instead of pure states, open system formulation is\ncomputationally more demanding than pure-state simulation. This typically means that somewhat smaller\nchains can be simulated. In addition, simulation at low\nenergy (temperature) is more demanding because the\noperator-space entanglement of the NESS increases with\ndecreasing temperature.49 For instance, at an infinite\ntemperature the NESS, being proportional to 1, is separable with no entanglement. Therefore, due to computational constraints, we had to focus on somewhat higher\nenergies than in the wavepacket simulations.\nOnce we determine NESS for a given driving and\nlength L we calculate the expectation value of local\nmagnetization, obtaining the difference in magnetization between left and right ends \u2206S z , local spin cury\nx\nrent jl = (Slx Sl+1\n\u2212 Sly Sl+1\n) (which is independent of\nl), and local energy density. Because the deviation from\nthe equilibrium zero magnetization is small, around 0.1\nin high energy simulations and \u2248 0.01 at the lowest energy, and the imposed temperature is the same at both\nends, the energy density in the NESS is constant along\n\n5.7\n\n-0.0067 -0.047 -0.105\n\nL\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\u03b2=1/T\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nFIG. 8.

On the top axis we also list temperatures and\nenergy densities corresponding to 5 NESSs. Inset: scaling of\nfinite-size D with the chain length L. Horizontal lines indicate\nthe asymptotic D's used in the main plot.\n\nthe chain. The effective temperature in the bulk of the\nchain is then determined by equating this energy density to the canonical one (local chemical potential in the\nNESS is close to zero). The finite-size diffusion constant\ncan then be determined as D = (L \u2212 1) * jl /\u2206S z . Taking\ninto account definition of spin conductivity and of D calculated here,50 the spin conductivity \u03ba can be obtained\nfrom the diffusion constant simply as \u03ba = \u03b2 D (\u03b2 = 1/T ).\nTo ensure that the behavior is really diffusive and such\nD does not depend on size L, we have calculated D for\nsizes up to L = 64. This data can be seen in the inset of\nFig. 8. One can see that at high temperatures (T > 2,\nlower three chain lines in the inset) a good convergence of\nD is obtained, signaling diffusive spin transport also at a\nfinite temperature. At the lowest temperature T \u2248 0.82\nthat we were able to simulate, convergence is less clear.\nFrom the data on D(T ) in Fig. 8, one can clearly see that\nthe diffusion constant increases at lower energies, the increase being perhaps exponential in the inverse temperature \u03b2, as indicated by a dashed line. At low temperatures/energies the diffusion constant can get very large.\nIf we dare to extrapolate this dependence to the energy\nof the packet simulated in Fig. 2, and we take the average\ntemperature T \u2248 0.17 as a crude estimate, the diffusion\nconstant would be D \u223c 5000. This means that to really\nobserve a diffusive behavior in a wavepacket simulation\none would have to simulate chain up to times of the order \u223c 5000, demanding also chains of a similar size. We\nexpect that ballistic jet, visible at short times, will disappear after this long time scale. All these results mean\nthat with the tDMRG, being limited to few 100 spins,\none probably cannot conclusively say whether the spin\ntransport is diffusive or ballistic at such low energies.\n\n\f11\n\nIV.\n\n0.15\n\n(a)\n\n0.10\n0.05\n\nS\u0303lz\n\n0.00\n\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.10\n\n\u22120.15\n50\n40\n\nt\n\nWith an open-system tDMRG version we have nevertheless obtained strong indications that at not too\nlow temperatures, T > 1, the anisotropic Heisenberg\nmodel is diffusive. The diffusion constant increases fast\nwith decreasing temperature. Another thing we know is\nthat at energy scales below the gap (E1 \u2212 E0 \u2248 0.1 at\n\u2206 = 1.5), the system is trivially insulating; therefore,\nD(T = 0) = 0. At low temperatures that are still much\nabove the gap there are then basically two possibilities:\neither the system is ballistic, meaning that the diffusion\nconstant diverges at a finite temperature T , or the system is diffusive but with an exponentially large D. We\nfind the latter scenario more plausible.\nIn any case, as one decreases \u2206 toward 1, the gap disappears and therefore also an insulating state at T = 0.\nAt \u2206 = 1 the diffusion constant is therefore infinite at\nzero temperature (in agreement with a nonzero Drude\nweight12 ), the transport therefore being either ballistic\nor anomalous. Recent results in Ref. 26 show that at\nan infinite temperature and \u2206 = 1 it is anomalous (superdiffusive).\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n(b)\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nl\n\n150\n\n200\n\n0.14\n0.12\n0.10\n0.09\n0.07\n0.06\n0.04\n0.03\n0.01\n0.00\n\nFIG. 9.

Ballistic spreading\nof the domain wall is clearly seen.\n\nDOMAIN WALL DYNAMICS\n\nIn the present section we will focus on particular initial\nstates whose time evolution is quite different from the one\nof the Gaussian packets. These are states with a domainwall-shaped initial magnetization profiles. Such states\nare nongeneric and therefore do not influence our conclusions about magnetization transport reached earlier.\nThe purpose is just to point out that, due to symmetry,\nthere are particular states with different behavior. Such\nstates were investigated in the context of domain-wall\ndynamics,62,63 relaxation dynamics,64 and domain-wall\nstability.54\u201356 For a gapless regime (\u2206 < 1), numerical\nand analytical results suggest ballistic spreading of the\ninitial domain-wall. Less is known about dynamics in a\nmassive phase (\u2206 > 1). Time evolution of completely\npolarized domain walls have been studied numerically in\nRef. 63 and analytically using semiclassical approximation in Ref. 61. Here we extend analysis to low-energy\npartially polarized domain states.\nWe get domain-wall initial states as ground states of\nthe Heiseneberg XXZ chain defined by Eqs. (1) and (10)\nin a step-shaped magnetic field given by\nBl = 2B\u0398(\n\nL+1\n\u2212 l) \u2212 B,\n2\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u0398 is Heaviside step function and B is the magnitude of an external magnetic field that polarizes spins\non the left and right side of the chain in opposite directions. In the limit B \u2192 \u221e, ground state of the chain is\ngiven by the simple product state |\u2191 ... \u2191\u2193 ... \u2193i, while it\nis more complicated for finite B. Nonetheless, the shape\nof the spin profile hSlz i retains approximately step-like\nshape if we employ the nearest-neighbor averaging of S\u0303lz\nto account for Friedel oscillations. The main question we\n\nstudied was whether the initial domain-wall stays localized or it decays with time. To access this we have determined the domain-wall width w at time t as the distance\nbetween locations, positioned symmetrically around the\nmiddle of the chain, where the value of magnetization S\u0303lz\nexceeds positive/negative offset value of magnetization\n\u00b1Mw equal to half of the maximal one.\nFor the gapless case \u2206 < 1, the ballistic spreading\nof the domain wall was obtained by directly observing\nlinearly increasing width of the domain wall (w \u223c t).\nBallistic behavior of domain-wall states was observed independently of the level of polarization, determined by\ninitial state polarization B. An example of profiles for\nB = 0.5, \u2206 = 0.5 is shown in Fig. 9.\nIn the gapped regime \u2206 > 1, the dynamics of the initial domain wall is more complex. To determine whether\nthe domain wall spreads diffusively or remains frozen due\nto localization, we have observed time evolution of the\ndomain-wall width w(t) for different values of \u2206 > 1 and\nfor various polarizations of initial states, determined by\nB. For all \u2206, the initial state used has been the same\nand was obtained as a ground state of Hamiltonian with\n\u2206 = 1. At t = 0 magnetic field B was turned off and \u2206\nwas quenched to the target value. We have observed that\nfor all \u2206 > 1, independently of the initial state polarization B, the width of the domain wall w(t) grows until\nit attains some maximal value wmax and then starts oscillating around some final value wfinal (see Fig. 10 for\nan example of B = 0.5). Whether these oscillations are\ndamped out as the time progresses could not be determined on the accessible time scales. It therefore appears\nthat for \u2206 > 1 the initial domain wall stays localized.\nThe functional dependence of the domain-wall width on\nthe value of anisotropy \u2206 was suggested in Refs. 55 and\n\n\f12\n0.06\n\n(a)\n\n0.04\n0.02\n\nS\u0303lz\n\n0.00\n\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.04\n\n\u22120.06\n50\n\nt\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n(b)\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nl\n\n200\n\n0.05\n0.05\n0.04\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.02\n0.01\n0.01\n0.00\n\nFIG. 10.

Here the spreading of\nthe domain wall stops and the domain wall starts to oscillate around a stable shape (see, e.g., cross sections at times\nt = 40 and t = 50).\n8\n\nstates in the ferromagnetic Heisenberg system with kink\nboundary terms in Ref. 65. Recently, localization of a\nfully polarized domain wall in the quantum anisotropic\nHeisenberg spin chain (ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic) has been observed57 in the context of negative differential conductivity and explained58 in terms of a onemagnon localization. See also recent work in Ref. 59. We\nhave compared the measured maximal widths60 wmax to\nthe suggested scaling form, Eq. (16). Results reported\nin Fig. 11 are found to be in good agreement for large\ninitial domain-wall polarizations (B \u2192 \u221e), especially\naround \u2206 \u2248 1, where domain-wall widths span multiple spin sites. At larger anisotropies the domain wall\nwidths are in a range of a few spins so wmax is strongly\ndependent on the details of the procedure for the domain width determination (e.g. averaging of magnetization profile and choice of domain-wall boundaries Mw ),\nso that the measured value of the domain width deviates\nfrom the suggested scaling form. For weaker polarizations of initial states (B \u223c 1) the determination of the\ndomain-wall width wmax is more involved as transient effects of the domain-wall dynamics get more pronounced.\nThe functional dependence of wmax for B \u223c 1 was therefore not compared to the scaling form of Eq. (16). However, we have noticed that the domain wall stays localized\neven for weakly polarized initial states, at least up to the\ntimescales of t \u223c 100.\n\n7\n\nwmax\n\n6\n\nV.\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.7\n\n\u2206\n\nFIG. 11.

By a combination of wavepacket spreading and\nthe study of nonequilibrium steady states we reach a\nconclusion that the transport is diffusive in the gapped\nregime. By lowering the temperature the diffusion constant increases, perhaps exponentially so with the inverse\ntemperature. A very large diffusion constant at low temperatures introduces a very long time and space scale\nthat governs the transition from a ballistic behavior at\nshort time to an asymptotic diffusive at long times. Using\nexisting numerical techniques, that are limited to short\ntimes and small system sizes, it is therefore very difficult\nto observe diffusive behavior at very low energies.\n\n56 for the ferromagnetic 1D Heisenberg model, having\nthe form\nw=\n\nlog(\u2206 +\n\nA\n\u221a\n\n\u22062 \u2212 1)\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere A is dependent on the used definition of the\ndomain-wall width.
