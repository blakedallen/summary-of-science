However, that information\nis also contained in market prices of insurance securities that are contingent on a large (highly unlikely)\ndownside, if we concede that those prices are mostly reflective of protection buyers' risk aversion. Examples\nare out-of-the-money put options that provide protection on large stock price drops, or senior tranches of\nCDOs that protect against the default risk of say 15 \u2212 30% of investment grade US companies over a 5 year\nperiod.\nA central regulatory and internal requirement in recent years, in the wake of a number of financial\ndisasters and corporate scandals, has been that firms report a measure of the risk of their financial positions.\nThe industry-standard risk measure, value-at-risk, is widely criticized for not being convex and thereby\npossibly penalizing diversification, and a number of natural problems arise:\n\u2217\nORFE Department, Princeton University, Sherrerd Hall, Princeton NJ 08544; sircar@princeton.edu.

Computation of these risk measures under typical financial models.\n3. Choice: what is the \"right\" risk measure?\nThe first issue has been extensively studied in the static case [ADEH99, FS02] and recent developments in\nextending to dynamic risk measures with good time-consistency and/or recursive properties are discussed,\ne.g., in [BK09, KS05, MZ09, FS11]. However, concrete examples of dynamic, time-consistent convex\nrisk measures are scarce, and they typically have to be defined abstractly, for example via the driver of a\nbackward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) or as the limit of discrete time-consistent risk measures\n[Sta10]. As a result, intuition is lost, and there is at present little understanding what the choice of driver\nsays about the measure of risk. Or, to put it another way, how can the driver be constructed to be consistent\nwith risk aversion reflected in the market?\nLet \u03be be a bounded random variable representing a financial payoff whose value is known at some\nfuture time T < \u221e. A classical example of a convex risk measure, the entropic risk measure, is related to\nexponential utility:\n\u0010 h\ni\u0011\n1\n(1)\n\u033a(\u03be) = log E e\u2212\u03b3\u03be ,\n\u03b3\nwhere \u03b3 > 0 is a risk-aversion coefficient. When extending to dynamic risk measures \u033at (*) adapted to some\nfiltration (Ft ), a desirable property is (strong) time-consistency\n\u033as (\u2212\u033at (\u03be)) = \u033as (\u03be),\n\n0 \u2264 s \u2264 t \u2264 T.\n\nThis flow property is important if \u033at is used as a basis for a pricing system. The static entropic risk measure\n(1) generalizes to\ni\u0011\n\u0010 h\n1\n(2)\n\u033at (\u03be) = log E e\u2212\u03b3\u03be | Ft .\n\u03b3\n\nThe flow property follows simply from the tower property of conditional expectations. However, finding\nother directly-defined examples is not easy, and to have a reasonable class of choices, we need to resort to\nmore abstract constructions.\nIn a Brownian-based model, time-consistent dynamic risk measures can be built through BSDEs, as\nshown in [BK09, KS05] (compare also [Gia06]), extending the work of Peng [Pen04]. That is, on a probability space with a d-dimensional Brownian motion W that generates a filtration (Ft ), the risk measure of the\nFT -measurable random variable \u03be (taking values in R for simplicity) is computed from the solution (Rt , Zt ),\nwhich takes values in R \u00d7 Rd , of the BSDE\n\u2212dRt = g(t, Zt ) dt \u2212 Zt\u2217 dWt\nRT\n\n= \u2212\u03be,\n\nwhere \u2217 denotes transpose. Here the driver g, which defines the risk measure, is Lipschitz and convex in z\nand satisfies g(t, 0) = 0. The solution is a process R, taking values in R that matches the terminal condition\n\u2212\u03be on date T (when \u03be is revealed and the risk is known), and a process Z taking values in Rd that, roughly\nspeaking, keeps the solution non-anticipating. Then \u033at (\u03be) := Rt defines a time-consistent dynamic convex\nrisk measure. However, the possibility to offset risk by dynamically hedging in the market needs to be\naccounted for. Setting aside technicalities for the moment, this operation leads to a modification of the\ndriver.\nThe left tail of the implied volatility skew observed in equity markets is a reflection of the premium\ncharged for out-of-the-money put options. The bulk of the skew reveals the heavy left tail in the risk-neutral\n2\n\n\fdensity of the stock price S T at expiration, but the very far left tail, where investor sentiment and crash-ophobia takes over, could be interpreted as revealing information about the representative market risk measure\nand its driver g, if we assume prices are consistent with this kind of pricing mechanism. The question then is\nto extract constraints on the driver from the observed tails of the skew, an inverse problem. In the application\nto equity options in Section 3, we assume the mid-market option prices reflect the premium a risk-averse\nbuyer is willing to pay. We do not relate buyers' and sellers' prices to the bid-ask spread, since that is more\nlikely related to the market maker's profit.\nTo put our analysis into a broader framework, we observe that the underlying structural question is\nthe inference of preference structures from observable data. The idea of using (at least in theory) observable consumption and investment streams to reveal the preference structure of a rational utility maximizing\ninvestor dates back to Samuelson in the 1940s and Black in the 1960s - for a recent overview on this \"backward approach\" to utility theory we refer to [CHO11]. The spirit of our presentation is a similar one, except\nwe deal with dynamic risk measures rather than utility functions, and the observable data are not given as\nconsumption and investment strategies but as readily available market implied volatilities.\nThe main goal of the current article is to develop short-time asymptotics that can be used for the inverse\nproblem of extracting information about the driver g from the observed skew. This could be used to construct\nan approximation to the driver and then to value more exotic derivatives in a way consistent with the risk\nmeasure. The information could also be used to quantify market perception of tail events, particularly when\nthey depart from usual. Some studies have discussed the steepening of skew slopes in the run up to financial\ncrises without a corresponding overall raise in volatility level. Inferring, fully or partially, a risk measure\ndriver, could be used for detection of increased wariness of a crash.\nBerestycki et al. [BBF04] presented short-time asymptotics for implied volatilities for no arbitrage\npricing under a given risk-neutral measure in stochastic volatility models. Further work in this direction\nincludes, among others, [FFF10, FJ09, FJL10] and references therein. In Section 2, we extend this analysis\nto the nonlinear PDEs characterizing indifference pricing under dynamic convex risk measures.\nWe find (Theorem 2.12) that the zero-order term in the short-time approximation is the same as found in\nno-arbitrage pricing by [BBF04]. The next order term is the solution of an inhomogeneous linear transport\nequation that sees only a particular slope of the partially Legendre-transformed driver, but is independent of\nthe size of the options position (see equation (27)).\nSection 3 illustrates the theoretical findings by focusing on a particular class of drivers, introducing\ndistorted entropic convex dynamic risk measures. First we develop explicit calculations for the small time\nexpansion in the Hull-White stochastic volatility model to illustrate the impact of the distortion parameter\non the implied volatility skew. In Section 3.3, as a proof of concept, we perform a preliminary calibration\nexercise of the short time asymptotics to S&P 500 implied volatilities close to maturity. This allows to\nestimate the stochastic volatility model parameters from the liquid central part of the skew, and to recover\nthe distortion parameter of our family of dynamic convex risk measures from far out-of-the-money put\noptions.\nWe illustrate the parameter impact for longer dated options in a numerical study (via the pricing PDE) of\narctangent stochastic volatility driven by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Section 4 contains the conclusions\nand Section 5 gives the more technical proofs omitted in the exposition.\n\n2 Heuristics and Statement of Results\nWe consider a model of a financial market consisting of a risk-free bond bearing no interest and some stock\nfollowing the stochastic volatility model on the filtered probability space (\u03a9, F , (Ft ), P)\n(\nS0 = S;\ndS t = \u03bc(Yt )S t dt + \u03c3(Yt )S t dWt1 ,\n\u0001\n(3)\n\u2032\n2\n1\ndYt = m(Yt ) dt + a(Yt ) \u03c1 dWt + \u03c1 dWt ,\nY0 = y,\n3\n\n\fwhere W 1 , W 2 are two independent Brownian motions generating (Ft ) and \u03c1\u2032 =\nAssumption 2.1.

We call the family \u033at : L\u221e (\u03a9, FT , P) \u2192 L\u221e (\u03a9, Ft , P), 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T , a convex dynamic risk\nmeasure, if it satisfies for all t \u2208 [0, T ] and all \u03be, \u03be 1 , \u03be 2 \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9, FT , P) the following properties.\ni)\nii)\niii)\niv)\n\nMonotonicity: \u03be 1 \u2265 \u03be 2 P-a.s implies \u033at (\u03be 1 ) \u2264 \u033at (\u03be 2 );\nCash invariance: \u033at (\u03be + mt ) = \u033at (\u03be) \u2212 mt for all mt \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9, Ft , P);\nConvexity: \u033at (\u03b1\u03be 1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03be 2 ) \u2264 \u03b1\u033at (\u03be 1 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u033at (\u03be 2 ) for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1];\nTime-consistency \u033at (\u03be 1 ) = \u033at (\u03be 2 ) implies \u033as (\u03be 1 ) = \u033as (\u03be 2 ) for all 0 \u2264 s \u2264 t.\n\nWe note that if the risk measure is additionally normalized, i.e. \u033at (0) = 0 for all t \u2208 [0, T ], then iv)\nis equivalent to the stronger property \u033as (\u2212\u033at (\u03be)) = \u033as (\u03be) for all 0 \u2264 s \u2264 t [KS05, Lemma 3.5]. The risk\nmeasure \u033at (\u03be) should be understood as the risk associated with the position \u03be at time t.\nIf \u033at is normalized, this is nothing else than the minimal capital requirement at time t to make the position\nriskless since \u033at (\u03be + \u033at (\u03be)) = 0. In this static setting, the certainty equivalent price of a buyer of a derivative\n\u03be \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9, FT , P) at time t is just the cash amount for which buying the derivative has equal risk to not\nbuying it.\nIn fact we are much more interested in the case where the buyer of the security is allowed to trade in\nthe stock market to hedge her risk. In describing admissible strategies we follow the setting of continuous\ntime arbitrage theory in the spirit of Delbaen-Schachermayer (for an overview, we refer to the monograph\n[DS06]). Denote therefore by \u0398t the set of\nR u all admissible hedging strategies from time t onwards, i.e. all\nprogressive processes such that \u03b8t = 0 and t \u03b8 s (\u03bc(Y s ) ds+\u03c3(Y s ) dW s1 ) exists for all u \u2208]t, T ] and is uniformly\nbounded from below, and set\n(Z T\n)\n1\nKt :=\n\u03b8 s (\u03bc(Y s ) ds + \u03c3(Y s ) dW s ) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398t .\nt\n\nThe set of all superhedgeable payoffs is then given by Ct := (Kt \u2212 L0+ ) \u2229 L\u221e , where L0+ denotes the set of all\nalmost surely non-negative random variables.\nThe residual risk at time t of the derivative \u03be \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9, FT , P) after hedging is given by\n\u033a\u02c6 t (\u03be) := ess inf \u033at (\u03be + h).\nh\u2208Ct\n\n(4)\n\nThus, assuming that the buyer's wealth at time t is x, her dynamic indifference price Pt , which can be viewed\nas the certainty equivalent after optimal hedging in the underlying market, is given via \u033a\u02c6 t (x + \u03be \u2212 Pt ) = \u033a\u02c6 t (x),\nwhence, using cash invariance,\nPt = \u033a\u02c6 t (0) \u2212 \u033a\u02c6 t (\u03be).\n(5)\n4\n\n\fWe note, while restricting ourselves to the buyer's indifference price, all our considerations are easily adaptable to the seller's indifference price by a simple change of signs of \u03be and Pt in (5).\nA convenient class of dynamic convex risk measures to which we will stick throughout this paper are\ndefined from solutions of BSDEs. Assume that g : [0, T ] \u00d7 \u03a9 \u00d7 R2 \u2192 R is a P \u2297 B(R2 ) predictable\nfunction which is continuous, convex, and quadratic (i.e. bounded in modulus by a quadratic function) in\nthe R2 -component. Next, let \u03be \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9, FT , P) be a given bounded financial position. Then the BSDE\nRt = \u2212\u03be +\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nT\n\ng(t, \u03c9, Z s1 , Z s2 ) ds\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nT\n\nZ s1 dW s1\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nT\nt\n\nZ s2 dW s2\n\n(6)\n\nadmits a unique Ft -adapted solution (Rt , Zt1 , Zt2 ), which defines a dynamic convex risk measure via \u033at (X) :=\nRt [BK09, Theorem 3.21].\nThe existence of a solution of the BSDE (6) in this quadratic setting was first proved by Kobylanski\n[Kob00, Theorem 2.3], with some corrections to their arguments given by Nutz [Nut07, Theorem 3.6],\nwhereas the uniqueness follows from the convexity of the driver as shown in [BH08, Corollary 6]. From a\nfinancial perspective, the components Z 1 , Z 2 of the \"auxiliary\" process Z can be interpreted as risk sources,\ndescribing the risk stemming from the traded asset and the volatility process respectively.\n\n2.2 Transformed BSDE under Hedging\nTo assure the solvability of the BSDEs and PDEs that arise in our setting, we have to restrict the class of\nadmissible drivers. Throughout, subscripts of functions indicate in the PDE context partial derivatives with\nthe respect to the respective components.\nDefinition 2.3. We call a function g : R2 \u2192 R a strictly quadratic driver (normalized strictly quadratic\ndriver) if it satisfies the following conditions i)-iii) (resp. o)-iii)):\no)\ni)\nii)\niii)\n\ng(0, 0) = 0;\ng \u2208 C 2,1 (R2 );\ngz1 z1 (z1 , z2 ) > 0 for all (z1 , z2 ) \u2208 R2 ;\nthere exist constants c1 , c2 > 0 such that\n\u0011\n\u0010 z2\n\u0001\nc1 4c12 \u2212 (1 + z22 ) \u2264 g(z1 , z2 ) \u2264 c2 1 + z21 + z22 for all (z1 , z2 ) \u2208 R2 .\n1\n\nThe normalization of the driver (condition o)) corresponds to the normalization of the risk measure.\nRemark 2.4. To ease the presentation, we only work with drivers that do not depend explicitly on time or\non \u03c9. While any dependence on Rt would destroy the cash invariance, it is not difficult to add an additional\ndependence of g on time (requiring some local H\u00f6lder-continuity in the time component of g). The small time\nexpansion Section 2.5 up to first order works in this case exactly as in the time independent case (evaluating\nthe driver at t = T ), and the higher order expansions can be adapted straightforwardly. For analysis of\nfiltration-consistent, translation invariant nonlinear expectations, we refer to [CHMP02].\nIn passing from the principal risk measure defined by g to the residual risk measure after hedging, as in\n(4), we will need the Fenchel-Legendre transform of g in its first component, namely\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b6 \u2208 R.\n(7)\n\u011d(\u03b6, z2 ) := sup \u03b6z1 \u2212 g(z1 , z2 ) ,\nz1 \u2208R\n\nLemma 2.5. Given that g is a (normalized) strictly quadratic driver, then the risk-adjusted driver \u011d defined\nin (7) is also a (normalized) strictly quadratic driver.\n5\n\n\fProof. To show \u011d satisfies condition iii) of Definition 2.3, we fix z2 and treat the function as classical\nFenchel-Legendre transform in one variable. Therefore it holds for proper, continuous convex functions\nf , g, that f \u2264 g implies f\u02c6 \u2265 \u011d and f\u02c6\u02c6 = f , [HUL01b, Proposition E.1.3.1 and Corollary E.1.3.6]. So the\nstatement is proved by noting that\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010 z2\n\u0001\u0011\nsup \u03bez1 \u2212 c 1 + z21 + z22 = c 12 \u2212 (1 + z22 )\n4c\nz1\n\nfor any positive constant c.\nTo show i) and ii) in Definition 2.3, we note that condition iii) implies that g is 1-coercive in z1 , i.e.\ng(z1 , z2 )/|z1 | \u2192 \u221e as z1 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e for fixed z2 . Now we can use the fact, that the Fenchel-Legendre transform\nof any 1-coercive, twice differentiable function with positive second derivative is itself 1-coercive and twice\ndifferentiable with positive second derivative, cf. [HUL01a, Corollary X.4.2.10]. Thus it remains only to\nprove the differentiability of \u011d with respect to z2 which is a consequence of the differentiability properties of\ng: writing down the difference quotient and noting that the maximizer is differentiable, the positive second\nderivative with respect to the first component yields the existence of a finite limit. Finally \u011d(0, 0) = 0 follows\nfrom the definition if g(0, 0) = 0.\n\u0003\nIn other words, the class of strictly quadratic drivers is invariant under the convex conjugation in the first\ncomponent and the class of normalized strictly quadratic drivers is an invariant subclass thereof.\nRemark 2.6. We note that it is important in our setting to stick to the theory of quadratic drivers, since if g\nwould be a Lipschitz driver, \u011d would be no more a proper function. This fact is easily seen, since from the\nLipschitz condition it follows that\nq\n\u0011 \u221a\n\u0010\n\u0001\ng(z1 , z2 ) \u2264 L 1 + z21 + z22 \u2264 2L 1 + |z1 | + |z2 |\nfor some constant L and hence\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u0001\u0011\n\u011d(\u03b6, z2 ) = sup \u03b6z1 \u2212 g(z1 , z2 ) \u2265 sup \u03b6z1 \u2212 2L 1 + |z1 | + |z2 |\nz1\n\nz1\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\u221a\n\u221e if |\u03b6| > \u221a2L\n\u2212 2L(1 + |z2 |) if |\u03b6| \u2264 2L.\n\u221a\n\nFrom now on we will assume that g is convex as a function on R2 and an admissible driver. Our next step\nis to describe the dynamic hedging risk in terms of BSDEs. These results are in essence due to Toussaint,\n[Tou07, Section 4.4.1]. Since his thesis is not easily available, we will nevertheless state the proofs here. It\nis convenient to introduce a notation for the Sharpe ratio:\n\u03bb(y) :=\n\n\u03bc(y)\n.\n\u03c3(y)\n\n(8)\n\nProposition 2.7. The risk of the financial position \u03be \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9, FT , P) under hedging is \u033a\u02c6 t (\u03be) = R\u0302t\n(\u03be)\nR\u0302t is given via the unique solution of the BSDE\nR\u0302t(\u03be)\n\n= \u2212\u03be \u2212\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nT\n\n\u1e90 s1 \u03bb(Y s ) +\n\n\u011d\n\n\u0001\n\u2212\u03bb(Y s ), \u1e90 s2 ds\n\nMoreover, \u033a\u02c6 t is itself a dynamic convex risk measure.\n\n6\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nT\n\n\u1e90 s1 dW s1\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\n(\u03be)\n\nwhere\n\nT\nt\n\n\u1e90 s2 dW s2 .\n\n(9)\n\n\fProof. It follows from the work of Kl\u00f6ppel and Schweizer [KS05, Theorem 7.17] that the risk is given via\nthe BSDE\nZ\nZ\nZ\nT\n\n(\u03be)\n\nR\u0302t = \u2212\u03be +\n\nt\n\nT\n\nT\n\ng\u0303(Z s1 , Z s2 ) ds \u2212\n\nt\n\n\u1e90 s1 dW s1 \u2212\n\nt\n\n\u1e90 s2 dW s2 ,\n\nwhere g\u0303 is given by the infimal convolution\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\ng\u0303(z1 , z2 ) := inf g(z1 + \u03c3(Yt )v, z2 ) + \u03bc(Yt )v .\nv\u2208R\n\n(10)\n\nTo be precise, besides the differences in sign between our convex risk measures and their monetary concave\nutility functionals, our L\u221e framework is in line with the main part of their paper where they work in L\u221e .\nHowever, the result [KS05, Theorem 7.17] is stated in the framework of L2 -BSDEs with Lipschitz drivers.\nTheir detour to L2 was due to their consideration that this is the natural framework for BSDEs. We have\nmotivated that we have to work with quadratic drivers, for which there is yet no L2 -theory, but it is straightforward (though tedious) to check that their result (10) adapts to our setting due to the regularity enforced\nby the admissibility conditions in Definition 2.3.\nNext, we rewrite the infimum in (10) to get\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\ng\u0303(z1 , z2 ) = inf g(u, z2 ) \u2212 (z1 \u2212 u)\u03bb(Yt ) = \u2212z1 \u03bb(Yt ) \u2212 \u011d \u2212\u03bb(Yt ), z2 .\nu\u2208R\n\nFinally, the uniqueness of the solution of the BSDE (9) follows again from [BH08, Corollary 6] using the\nconvexity of the driver, which is implied by the fact that \u011d is concave in the second component. Moreover,\nthis entails also that \u033a\u02c6 is a dynamic convex risk measure.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.8.\n1. We remark that in view of equation (9) of the above proposition, the notion of admissibility could be slightly extended: it is possible to replace the lower bound in Definition 2.3, iii)\nby\n\u0001\nc1 f (z1 ) \u2212 (1 + z22 ) \u2264 g(z1 , z2 )\n\nfor an arbitrary real-valued, convex and 1-coercive function f . This is enough to get existence and\nuniqueness of equation (9), however it would clearly destroy the nice invariance property of Lemma\n2.5 and we do not adopt it in the following.\n\n2. As in (9) and the rest of the paper, the first argument of \u011d is the negative of the Sharpe ratio. If we\nknew a priori that the Sharpe ratio was small relative to the minimal Lipschitz constant L in Remark\n2.6, then we could allow BSDEs with Lipschitz drivers. However we choose to put restrictions on the\ndriver, such as in Definition 2.3(iii), rather than on the range of the model parameters.\n\n2.3 Indifference Valuation of European Claims\nFrom the formula (5) for the indifference price Pt and Proposition 2.7, we have that\n(\u03be)\n\nPt = R\u0302(0)\nt \u2212 R\u0302t .\n\n(11)\n\nFrom now on we will restrict ourselves to particular bounded payoffs, namely European put options with\nstrike price K and maturity date T : \u03be = (K \u2212 S T )+ . Moreover, for the further treatment the substitutions\nx := log (S /K),\n\n\u03c4 := T \u2212 t,\n\n(12)\n\nwill be convenient and we introduce the following notation. Denote by LT the layer [0, T ] \u00d7 R2 and by\nQ\u03c40 ,r the open cylinder above the disk B(m, r) with midpoint m, radius r and height 0 < \u03c40 \u2264 T : Q\u03c40 ,r :=\n7\n\n\f]0, \u03c40 [\u00d7B(m, r). Since the location of the midpoint (once fixed) will play no further role, we skip it in the\nnotation.\nThe following theorem characterizes the indifference price of a European put with respect to the dynamic\nconvex risk measure with driver g under the stochastic volatility model (3).\nTheorem 2.9. The buyer's indifference price of the European put option is given as\nP(\u03c4, x, y) = \u0169(\u03c4, y) \u2212 u(\u03c4, x, y)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere u \u2208 C 1+\u03b2/2,2+\u03b2 (QT,r ) \u2229 C(LT ) for every cylinder QT,r is the solution of the semi-linear parabolic PDE\n(\n\u0001\n\u2212u\u03c4 + Lu = K1 \u011d \u2212\u03bb(y), \u03c1\u2032 Ka(y)uy ;\n(14)\nu(0, x, y) = \u2212(1 \u2212 ex )+ ,\nwith operator L given by\n\u0001\n1\nLu = Mu \u2212 \u03c32 (y)ux + m(y) \u2212 \u03c1a(y)\u03bb(y) uy\n2\n1\n1 2\nMu = \u03c3 (y)uxx + \u03c1\u03c3(y)a(y)uxy + a2 (y)uyy\n2\n2\n\n(15)\n\nand \u0169 denotes the (x-independent) solution of (14), with altered initial condition \u0169(0, y) = 0. Moreover there\nexists a solution of the Cauchy problem (14) (as well as that with the altered initial condition) which is the\nunique classical solution that is bounded in LT together with its derivatives.\nProof. By Ladyzhenskaya et al. [LSU67, Theorem V.8.1 and Remark V.8.1], there exists a classical solution\nv \u2208 C 1+\u03b2/2,2+\u03b2 (QT,r ) \u2229 C(LT ) to the semilinear parabolic PDE\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n1\nvt + \u03c32 (y)S 2 vS S + a(y)2 vyy + \u03c1\u03c3(y)a(y)S vS y + m(y) \u2212 \u03c1a(y)\u03bb(y) vy = \u011d \u2212\u03bb(y), \u03c1\u2032 a(y)vy ,\n2\n2\n\n(16)\n\nwith terminal condition v(T, S , y) = \u2212(K \u2212 S )+ which is the unique classical solution to this PDE that is\nbounded in LT together with its (first and second order) derivatives. Applying It\u00f4's formula to v(t, S t , Yt )\nand defining\nZ\u0304t1 := \u03c3(Yt )S t vs (t, S t , Yt ) + \u03c1a(Yt )vy (t, S t , Yt )\nZ\u0304t2 := \u03c1\u2032 a(Yt )vy (t, S t , Yt ),\nR\u0304t := v(t, S t , Yt )\nshows that (R\u0304t , Z\u0304t1 , Z\u0304t2 ) solves the BSDE (9) for (R\u0302t(\u03be) , \u1e90t1 , \u1e90t2 ) with \u03be = (K \u2212 S T )+ , and therefore we identify\n(\u03be)\nR\u0302t = v(t, S t , Yt ). The transformation (12), together with u(\u03c4, x, y) = v(t, s, y)/K leads to the Cauchy problem\n(14) for u. Finally, taking zero terminal condition for the PDE (16), and calling the solution \u1e7d(t, y) leads to\nR\u0302(0)\n= \u1e7d(t, Yt ). Therefore the indifference price in (11) is given by Pt = \u1e7d(t, Yt ) \u2212 v(t, S t , Yt ), which, in\nt\ntransformed notation, leads to (13).\n\u0003\nHere u is the value function of the holder of the put option, and \u0169 is related to the investment (or Merton)\nproblem with trading only in the underlying stock and money market account. The nonlinearity in the PDE\n(14) is in its \"Greek\" uy , that is, the Vega, and enters through the Legendre transform of the driver g in\nits first variable. For the familiar entropic risk measure, g(z1 , z2 ) = \u03b3(z21 + z22 )/2, where \u03b3 > 0 is a riskaversion parameter, we have \u011d(\u03b6, z2 ) = (\u03b6 2 /\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3z22 )/2. In this case, the nonlinearity is as u2y (see for example\n[BK05, SZ05]).\n8\n\n\f2.4 Implied Volatility PDE\nOur main goal is to establish an asymptotic expansion of the indifference price implied volatility in the limit\nof short time-to-maturity. To do so, we now adapt the approach of Berestycki et al. [BBF04] to establish\na PDE satisfied by the Black-Scholes volatility I(\u03c4, x, y) implied by the indifference pricing. Therefore we\nnote that in the Black-Scholes model with unit volatility, the no arbitrage pricing PDE is given by\n(\n\u0001\n\u2212U\u03c4 + 21 U xx \u2212 U x = 0;\nU(0, x) = (1 \u2212 ex )+ ,\nwhich can be represented explicitly as\n\u221a \u0011\n\u221a \u0011\n\u0010 x\n\u0010 x\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nx\nU(\u03c4, x) = \u03a6 \u2212 \u221a +\n\u2212e \u03a6 \u2212\u221a \u2212\n,\n2\n2\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\nwhere \u03a6 is the cumulative density function of the standard normal distribution. Using the scaling properties\nof the Black-Scholes put price, the indifference pricing implied volatility I(\u03c4, x, y) is hence given by the\nequation\nP(\u03c4, x, y) = U(I 2 (\u03c4, x, y)\u03c4, x).\n(17)\nBefore we derive a PDE for the implied volatility, we give some a priori bounds on indifference prices and\ntheir associated implied volatilities.\nProposition 2.10. Denote by PBS (\u03c4, x; \u03c3) the Black-Scholes price of the put calculated with constant volatility \u03c3. Then\n(18)\nPBS (\u03c4, x; \u03c3) \u2264 P(\u03c4, x, y) \u2264 PBS (\u03c4, x; \u03c3)\nand\n\u03c3 \u2264 I(\u03c4, x, y) \u2264 \u03c3,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03c3 and \u03c3 are the volatility bounds in Assumption 2.1.\nThe proof is given in Section 5.\nTo derive the PDE for the implied volatility, we plug (17) into the equation (13) and get after some\ncalculations - detailed in Section 5 - that the implied volatility I is subject to the nonlinear degenerate\nparabolic PDE\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u011d \u2212\u03bb(y), \u03c1\u2032 Ka(y)\u0169y \u2212 \u011d \u2212\u03bb(y), \u03c1\u2032 Ka(y)uy\n1 2 2\n2\n2 x\n\u2212 (\u03c4I )\u03c4 + \u03c4IMI + I G \u2212 \u03c4 I GI + \u03c4q(y)IIy = 2\u03c4IIy\n, (20)\nI 4\nK(\u0169y \u2212 uy )\nwith the square field type operator\nGI := MI 2 \u2212 2IMI\n\n(21)\n\nq(y) := \u03c1\u03c3(y)a(y) + 2m(y) \u2212 2\u03c1a(y)\u03bb(y).\n\n(22)\n\nand\nTo motivate an initial condition for the Cauchy problem, we send formally \u03c4 to zero in (20). As the\n\"Vega\" \u03bd = \u0169y \u2212 uy tends also to zero as \u03c4 \u2193 0 (this is shown in Lemma 5.2), we observe that the quotient on\nthe right side of (20)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u011d \u2212\u03bb(y), \u03c1\u2032 Ka(y)\u0169y \u2212 \u011d \u2212\u03bb(y), \u03c1\u2032 Ka(y)uy\n\u0001\n\u2192 \u03c1\u2032 a(y)\u011dz2 \u2212\u03bb(y), 0 ,\nK(\u0169y \u2212 uy )\nwhich is bounded by the definition of strictly quadratic drivers and Lemma 2.5. Dividing by I 2 , this leads to\nthe formal limit equation\nx\n= 1.\n(23)\nG\nI(0, x, y)\n9\n\n\fRemark 2.11. Our Cauchy problem is similar to that derived for no arbitrage pricing implied volatilities\nin [BBF04], where they have the same equation (20), but i) without the last term on the left side (which\nhere is due to the change in measure from physical to a risk-neutral one); and ii) without the right side term\n(which here is due to the dynamic convex risk measure used for indifference pricing). However, our initial\ncondition (23), which does not depend on \u011d and the drift of the stochastic volatility model, is exactly the\nsame as theirs.\nNow we turn this heuristic argument into a precise statement.\nTheorem 2.12. The implied volatility function I(\u03c4, x, y) generated by the indifference pricing mechanism is\nthe unique solution I \u2208 C 1+\u03b2/2,2+\u03b2 (QT,r ) \u2229 C(LT ) to the following nonlinear parabolic Cauchy problem\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u011d \u2212\u03bb(y), \u03c1\u2032 Ka(y)\u0169y \u2212 \u011d \u2212\u03bb(y), \u03c1\u2032 Ka(y)uy\n1 2 2\n2\n2 x\n(24)\n\u2212 (\u03c4I )\u03c4 + \u03c4IMI + I G \u2212 \u03c4 I GI + \u03c4q(y)IIy = 2\u03c4IIy\nI 4\nK(\u0169y \u2212 uy )\nwhere M, G, and q are given by (15), (21), and (22) respectively. The initial condition is given as I(0, x, y) =\nx/\u03c8(x, y) where \u03c8 is the unique viscosity solution of the eikonal equation\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nG\u03c8 = 1;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03c8(0,\ny) = 0;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c8(x, y) > 0 for x > 0.\n\n(25)\n\nThe proof is given in Section 5.\nIt is worthwhile to note that indifference prices are not linear. Indeed, buying double the amount of\nsecurities will not lead to twice the price. In this way also the volatility implied by indifference prices is\nquantity-dependent as a consequence of the appearance of uy and \u0169y on the right side of equation (24).\nHowever, the nonlinearity in quantity is not observed in the zeroth- and first-order small time-to-maturity\napproximation as we show in the following subsection. Moreover, deriving the PDE for the indifference\nprice implied volatility for buying n put options results in the same Cauchy problem as in Theorem 2.12,\nwhere one has only to replace K by nK in every appearance in equation (24).\n\n2.5 Small-Time Expansion\nIn the short time limit the implied volatility under indifference pricing is equal to the usual one as calculated\nby Berestycki e.a. [BBF04], as the initial conditions are the same (see Remark 2.11). The subtleties of the\nindifference pricing appear only away from maturity. This can be seen by methods of a formal small-time\nexpansions. We make the Ansatz of an asymptotic expansion of the implied volatility:\n\u0001\nI(\u03c4, x, y) = I 0 (x, y) 1 + \u03c4I 1 (x, y) + O(\u03c42 ) .\n\n(26)\n\nAs seen above, the term I 0 (x, y) = I(0, x, y) is given via solution of the eikonal equation (25). To find the\nPDE for I 1 , we plug the expansion (26) into the equation (24) and compare the first order terms for \u03c4 \u2192 0.\nThis leads to the inhomogeneous linear transport equation\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u03c8\u0010 2\n\u03c8\u0010\n\u03c8 x\n\u03c3 (y)\u03c8 x + \u03c1\u03c3(y)a(y)\u03c8y Ix1 (x, y) + \u03c1\u03c3(y)a(y)\u03c8 x + a2 (y)\u03c8y Iy1 (x, y) \u2212 M\n2\n2\nx \u03c8\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u03c8y\n\u0001\n= \u2212 q(y) \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 a(y)\u011dz2 \u2212\u03bb(y), 0\n\u03c8\n2I 1 (x, y) +\n\nwhere \u03c8 is again the solution of the eikonal equation (25).\n\n10\n\n(27)\n\n\fIt is important to observe that the dependence of this first order approximation on the risk measure (via\nits driver g) is given merely by the evaluation at z2 = 0 of the derivative of its Fenchel-Legendre transform\n\u011d with respect to the second component.\nComparing our PDE to the analogous equation in the arbitrage-pricing setting of [BBF04] (who, however, prescribe only the methodology in general and make explicit calculations just in one example), we note\nthe presence of two additional terms in (27) - one due to the change to a risk-neutral probability measure\nand the second due to indifference pricing with a dynamic convex risk measure.\nFurthermore in many we can obtain an interior boundary condition for the PDE at x = 0 by sending\nx formally to zero in (27), since by \u03c8 \u2192 0 and \u03c8 x it follows that the first order coefficients vanish. We\nwill show this specific procedure on a concrete example in Section 3.2. Imposing higher regularity on the\ncoefficients and on \u011d one can obtain also higher order terms in the expansion of the implied volatility. This\nis done by using Taylor expansions of \u011d (in the second component) and \u0169y and uy (in \u03c4).\n\n3 Examples & Computations\nIn this Section, we introduce a family of dynamic risk measures within which to present the effect of risk\naversion on implied volatilities, first using the asymptotic approximation in the Hull-White stochastic volatility model, and later using a numerical solution of the quasilinear option pricing PDE.\n\n3.1 Distorted Entropic Dynamic Convex Risk Measures\nTo study the impact of the driver on the implied volatility, we will now turn to a nicely parametrized family\nof risk measures. Therefore we define the following class of drivers, generating distorted forms of the\nentropic risk measure:\n\u0011\n\u03b72 \u03b3 2 \u03b3 \u0010\n\u03b3\nz2 = (z1 + \u03b7z2 )2 + z22 .\n(28)\ng\u03b7,\u03b3 (z1 , z2 ) := (z21 + z22 ) + \u03b7\u03b3z1 z2 +\n2\n2\n2\nIt is clear, that in the case \u03b7 = 0 this is the driver connected to the classical entropic risk measure, whereas \u03b7\ncan be seen as a parameter which describes in which way volatility risk increases also the risk coming from\nthe tradable asset. As we will see later in Section 3.4, \u03b7 effectively plays the role of a volatility risk premium.\nIn the case of the usual entropic risk measure the driver describes a circle whose radius is governed by the\nparameter \u03b3. In the distorted case it is now an ellipse where \u03b7 determines additionally the eccentricity.\nTurning to the Fenchel-Legendre transform, we have\n\u011d\u03b7,\u03b3 (\u03b6, z2 ) =\n\n1 2 \u03b3 2\n\u03b6 \u2212 z2 \u2212 \u03b7\u03b6 z2 .\n2\u03b3\n2\n\n(29)\n\nPlugging this into (24), we see that the right hand side now reads\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c4IIy 2\u03b7\u03c1\u2032 \u03bb(y)a(y) \u2212 \u03b3K\u03c1\u2032 2 a(y)2 (\u0169y + uy )\n\nand we remark in particular that \u03b3 scales with K and hence also with the number of securities bought (as\nmentioned at the end of Section 2.4). In particular we see again that the term appearing in the first order\n\u03b7,\u03b3\napproximation of the implied volatility, \u011dz2 (\u2212\u03bb(y), 0) = \u03b7\u03bb(y), is independent of \u03b3.\n\n3.2 Short-Time Asymptotics for the Hull-White Model\nIn the following we look at an example which is an adaption of Example 6.1/6.3 of [BBF04]. Let the\nstochastic volatility model be given as the Hull-White model\n(\nS 0 = s;\ndS t = \u03bc(Yt )S t dt + Yt S t dWt1 ,\n(30)\n2\nY0 = y.\ndYt = \u03baYt dWt ,\n11\n\n\ffor two independent Brownian motions W 1 , W 2 . Obviously the model does not fall in the class considered\nabove because the volatility \u03c3(Y) = Y is a geometric Brownian motion that is not bounded above or away\nfrom zero. Nevertheless, by a change of variables we will see that the results hold.\nWriting down the pricing PDE in the case of the distorted entropic risk measure (28), we get\n\u2212u\u03c4 +\n\n\u0001 1\n1 \u03bc(y)2 \u03b3K\u03ba2 2 2\n1 2\n\u2212\ny uxx + \u03ba2 y2 uyy \u2212 y2 ux =\ny uy + \u03b7\u03ba\u03bc(y)uy ,\n2\n2\n2\u03b3K y2\n2\n\nand one sees that by the time change \u03c4 7\u2192 \u03c4y2 (the boundary y = 0 is not hit when we start with y0 > 0 given\nthat Yt is a geometric Brownian motion) and setting \u03bc\u0303(y) := \u03bc(y)/y2 the equation becomes\n\u2212u\u03c4 +\n\n\u0001 1\n1\n1\n\u03b3K\u03ba2 2\nuxx + \u03ba2 uyy \u2212 ux =\n\u03bc\u0303(y)2 \u2212\nu + \u03b7\u03ba\u03bc\u0303(y)uy .\n2\n2\n2\u03b3K\n2 y\n\nThis equation has a solution (again by [LSU67, Theorem V.8.1 and Remark V.8.1]), at least in the case that\n\u03bc\u0303 is locally \u03b2-H\u00f6lder continuous (which in turn implies that \u03bc(y) = O(y2 ) as y \u2192 0) .\nIn absence of global bounds on the volatility we are not able to derive results about existence and\nuniqueness of solutions for the PDE (24) for the implied volatility. Nevertheless we can postulate the smalltime expansion to get\n\uf8f1 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03c8 + \u03ba2 \u03c82y = 1/y2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 x\n\u03c8(0, y) = 0\n(31)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03c8(x, y) > 0 for x > 0\nas the PDE characterizing it's zeroth oder term and\n\uf8f1\n\u03c8\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n= 2I 1 + y2 \u03c8\u03c8 x I x1 + \u03ba2 y2 \u03c8\u03c8y Iy1 \u2212 \u03c8x M \u03c8x \u2212 \u03b7\u03ba\u03bc(y) \u03c8y\n\uf8f2 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 I 1 (0, y) = \u03ba2 + \u03b7 \u03bc(y)\n12\n2y\n\n(32)\n\nfor the first. The interior boundary condition for I 1 at x = 0 follows from the formal asymptotics as x \u2192 0.\nAs derived in [BBF04], the zeroth order term of the expansion is given via the solution of (31),\ns\n\u0012\n\u03bax\n1\n\u03ba2 x2 \u0013\n+ 1+ 2 .\n\u03c8(x, y) = ln\n(33)\n\u03ba\ny\ny\nas I 0 (x, y) = x/\u03c8(x, y), whereas for (32) we can guarantee only a solution in the case where \u03bc(y) = O(y3 )\nsince Iy0 /I 0 = \u2212\u03c8y /\u03c8 = o(1/y) as y \u2192 0. Obviously this means practically that we need an extreme drift in\nthe Hull-White model to compensate the very volatile volatility process. However, setting e.g. \u03bc(y) = \u03bcy3\nfor some constant \u03bc, we are able to solve the PDE (32) explicitly by the method of characteristics to get\n!\n\u0012y\n\u0010\n1\n\u03bcx2\n\u03ba2 x2 \u0011 14 \u0013\n1\nI (x, y) = 2\n+\u03b7\nln \u03c8(x, y) 1 + 2\n.\n(34)\nx\n2\n\u03c8 (x, y)\ny\nIn Figure 1, we rely on the parameter set\n\u03bc = 6;\n\n\u03ba = 7;\n\ny = 0.3;\n\n\u03c4 = 0.1.\n\nWhereas the parameter \u03b3 does not appear in the first order approximation, the distortion parameter \u03b7 has\na double effect. On the one hand side it shifts the smile at the money a small amount, on the other hand it\n2\n2\nchanges more significantly the wing behavior of the smile, adding to the asymptotics the term \u03b7 \u03bc\u03ba2 (lnx|x|)2\n\n(since x2 /\u03c82 \u223c k2 x2 /(ln |x|)2 as x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e). This changes the whole wing behavior, since I 0 \u223c \u03ba ln|x||x| and\nI 1 \u2192 0 for \u03b7 = 0 as x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Of course \u03b7 = 0 corresponds to the first order term of martingale pricing as\n[BBF04]. Positive \u03b7 (hence a positive impact of the volatility risk on the risk of the traded asset) increases\nthe implied volatility and steepens the wings.\n12\n\n\fImplied Vol in Log-Moneyness\n0.9\n0th-order\n1st-order, \u0397=0\n0.8\n1st-order, \u0397=-0.2\n1st-order, \u0397=0.2\n0.7\n1st-order, \u0397=0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n0.1\n\n-0.1\n\nFigure 1: Implied volatility in terms of log-moneyness log(K/S 0 ) for the Hull-White model: zeroth and first\norder approximation in dependence of \u03b7.\n\n3.3 Calibration Exercise\nWe perform a simple calibration exercise using S&P 500 implied volatilities to show how the approximation\n(26) could be used to recover some information about the market's risk measure. We work with the short\ntime approximation in the uncorrelated Hull-White model (30) of Section 3.2 and within the family of\ndistorted dynamic convex risk measure (28).\nWe suppose that the near-the-money option prices are given by expectations under an equivalent martingale measure, specifically the minimal martingale measure. This corresponds to setting the distortion \u03b7 = 0,\nand so the short-time asymptotic approximation for implied volatilities I is\n\u0011\nx \u0010\nI\u2248\n1 + \u03c4I 1 (x, y) ,\n\u03c8(x, y)\n\nwhere \u03c8(x, y) is given by (33) and I 1 (x, y) by (34) with \u03b7 = 0. This gives\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n! 1 \uf8f6\uf8f6\uf8f7\n2 x2 4 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec y\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\u03ba\nx \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\u03c4\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed1 +\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,\nI \u2248 I M :=\nln \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed \u03c8(x, y) 1 + 2\n2\n\u03c8(x, y)\nx\n\u03c8 (x, y)\ny\n\nwhere we see that the approximation I M depends only on the parameter \u03ba and the current volatility level y.\nThen having fit the liquid implied volatilities to recover estimates of \u03ba and y, we can write the short time\napproximation with distortion as\n\u03c4x3\n,\n(35)\nI \u2248 I M + (\u03bc\u03b7) 3\n2\u03c8 (x, y)\nfrom which we can estimate the combination \u03bc\u03b7.\nIn Figure 2, we show the result of a fit to S&P 500 implied volatilities from options with nine days to\nmaturity on October 7th, 2010. We comment that the Hull-White model is not the best choice of stochastic volatility model, and our intention is primarily to demonstrate the procedure. In particular, because\nour asymptotic formulas are for the uncorrelated model, which always has a smile with minimum implied\nvolatility at the money, we restrict the fit to options with negative log-moneyness, which is mainly out-ofthe-money put options. The first part of the least-squares fitting to options with log-moneyness between\n13\n\n\f\u22120.06 and 0 gives \u03ba \u2248 6.6, and y \u2248 0.18. Then fitting to (35) the options with log-moneyness less than\n\u22120.06, which we view as less liquid and more reflective of the market's risk measure, gives the estimate\n\u03bc\u03b7 \u2248 35. We note that the \u03bc in this model is expected to be rather large because the composite drift of the\nstock is \u03bcy3 , and y << 1. So the estimate we get from the data of \u03bc\u03b7 is not unreasonable. In particular it\nreveals a positive distortion coefficient \u03b7.\n\n0.32\n\n0.3\n\nRisk measure fit to far out\u2212of\u2212the\u2212money puts\n\nImplied Volatilities\n\n0.28\n\n0.26\n\nFit to liquid option implied vols\n0.24\n\n0.22\n\n0.2\n\n0.18\n\u22120.08\n\n\u22120.07\n\n\u22120.06\n\n\u22120.05\n\n\u22120.04\n\n\u22120.03\n\n\u22120.02\n\n\u22120.01\n\n0\n\nLog\u2212Moneyness\n\nFigure 2: Fit of short-time asymptotics to S&P 500 implied volatility data 9 days from maturity.\n\n3.4 Numerical Study\nWe consider the buyer's indifference price of one European put option with respect to the family of distorted\nentropic risk measures defined by (28). We work within the stochastic volatility model (3) and, for the\nnumerical solution, we return to the primitive variables (t, S , y). Denote by Ly the generator of the Markov\nprocess Y:\n\u2202\n1\n\u22022\nLy = a(y)2 2 + m(y) ,\n2\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\nand by LS ,y the generator of (S , Y):\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u2202\n1\n+ \u03bc(y) .\nLS ,y = Ly + \u03c3(y)2 S 2 2 + \u03c1a(y)\u03c3(y)S\n2\n\u2202S \u2202y\n\u2202S\n\u2202S\nFrom (11), the buyer's indifference price of a put option with strike K and expiration date T at time t < T\nwhen S t = S and Yt = y, is given by:\nP(t, S , y) = \u03c6(t, S , y) \u2212 \u03c60 (t, y),\n14\n\n\fwhere \u03c6 solves\n!\n\u2202\n\u03c6 = \u2212\u011d(\u2212\u03bb(y), \u2212\u03c1\u2032 a(y)\u03c6y ),\n\u2202y\n\u03c6(T, S , y) = (K \u2212 S )+ ,\n\n\u03c6t + LS ,y \u2212 \u03c1a(y)\u03bb(y)\n\n(36)\n\nand \u03c60 (t, y) solves the same PDE without the S -derivatives and with zero terminal condition. Note that\n\u03c6 = \u2212v, where v was the solution to the PDE problem in (16), and \u03c60 = \u2212\u1e7d which was introduced in the\nproof of Theorem 2.9.\nAs \u011d is given by (29), we can re-write (36) as\n!\n\u2202\n\u03bb2 (y) 1\n\u2032\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )\u03b3a(y)2 \u03c62y .\n(37)\n\u03c6t + LS ,y \u2212 (\u03c1 + \u03b7\u03c1 )a(y)\u03bb(y)\n\u03c6=\u2212\n\u2202y\n2\u03b3\n2\nThis shows that \u03b7 plays the role of a volatility risk premium in that it enters as a drift adjustment for the\nvolatility-driving process Y. However the nonlinearity of the PDE is through a quadratic term in \u03c6y , as in\nthe case of the entropic risk measure.\nMoreover, introducing the transformation\n\u03c60 (t, y) = \u2212\n\n1\nlog f (t, y),\n\u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03c12 )\n\nleads to the linear PDE problem for f :\n!\n\u2202\n1\nft + Ly \u2212 (\u03c1 + \u03b7\u03c1 )a(y)\u03bb(y)\nf \u2212 \u03bb2 (y)(1 \u2212 \u03c12 ) f = 0,\n\u2202y\n2\nf (T, y) = 1.\n\u2032\n\n(38)\n(39)\n\nTherefore the indifference price is given by\nP(t, S , y) = \u03c6(t, S , y) +\n\n1\nlog f (t, y).\n\u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03c12 )\n\nIn the numerical solutions, we take the volatility-driving process (Yt ) to be an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with the dynamics:\n\u221a\n\u0001\ndYt = \u03b1(m \u2212 Yt ) dt + \u03bd 2\u03b1 \u03c1 dWt1 + \u03c1\u2032 dWt2 ,\n\nand we choose a function \u03c3(Y) that gives realistic volatility characteristics. For the OU process (Yt ), the rate\nof mean-reversion is \u03b1, the long-run mean-level is m and the long-run variance is \u03bd2 . For the computations,\nwe will take \u03b1 = 5, m = 0, \u03bd2 = 1, \u03c1 = \u22120.2 and\n\u03c3(y) =\n\n0.7\n(arctan(y \u2212 1) + \u03c0/2) + 0.03,\n\u03c0\n\nso that \u03c3(m) = 0.2050. The parameter \u03bd measures approximately the standard deviation of volatility fluctuations. The values are chosen such that the interval of width one standard deviation for Y under its stationary\ndistribution is (\u22121, 1), and this translates roughly to the interval (0.13, 0.38) for volatility \u03c3. The two standard deviation interval for volatility is approximately (0.10, 0.56).\nWe first solve the quasilinear PDE (37) for \u03c6 using implicit finite-differences on the linear part, and\nexplicit on the nonlinear part. Then we solve the linear PDE problem (38) for f . This procedure is done\nfor a current stock price S 0 = 100 and \u03c3(Y0 ) = 0.223, calculating the solutions for European put options\nexpiring in three months for strikes K in the range [70, 110] for different values of the distortion parameter\n\u03b7 and the risk-aversion parameter \u03b3 > 0.\n15\n\n\fFigure 3 reveals a more complex picture regarding the effect of \u03b7 away from the short maturity asymptotic approximation. We see, as in Figure 1 from the asymptotics, increasing \u03b7 increases the skew slope;\nhowever it also shifts down the levels of implied volatility around the money (as opposed to the opposite\neffect we saw in Figure 1).\nFigure 4 shows, as we would expect, that increasing risk aversion \u03b3 decreases the implied volatility skew\nwhich comes from the indifference price of the buyer who is willing to pay less for the risk of the option\nposition. It also has a secondary effect of flattening the skew out of the money.\n\n0.45\n\n0.45\n\n0.4\n\n0.35\n\nImplied Volatility\n\nImplied Volatility\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b7=\u22120.1\n\u03b7=0.1\n\u03b7=0.3\n\u03b7=0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.3\n\n0.25\n0.6\n0.2\n\u22120.4\n\n0.4\n\u22120.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n\u22120.2\n\nDistortion \u03b7\n\nLog Moneyness\n\n0.2\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.35\n\n\u22120.3\n\n\u22120.25\n\n\u22120.2 \u22120.15 \u22120.1\nLog Moneyness\n\n\u22120.05\n\n0\n\nFigure 3: Implied volatility from the arctangent stochastic volatility model in terms of log-moneyness\nlog(K/S 0 ) and \u03b7 with fixed \u03b3 = 0.5.\n\n4 Conclusion\nWe have derived a nonlinear PDE for the implied volatility from indifference pricing with respect to dynamic\nconvex risk measures defined by BSDEs under diffusion stochastic volatility models. Our asymptotic analysis has highlighted the principal effect of the risk measure on option implied volatility at short maturities,\nnamely through the appearance of \u011dz2 in the first order correction solving (27).\nIn the example of Section 3.2, this translates explicitly to a steepening effect on the implied volatility\nsmile from the distortion parameter \u03b7. Numerical computations confirm this away from short maturity too,\nas well as quantifying the effect of risk aversion on the level of implied volatilities.\nThe analysis can be used to infer some information about the driver, for example \u03b7 and \u03b3 in the family\n(28), from market implied volatilities. This is illustrated using the short time asymptotics for the Hull-White\nmodel on S&P 500 implied volatilities in Section 3.3.\n\n16\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n\f0.65\n\u03b3=0.1\n\u03b3=0.4\n\u03b3=0.7\n\u03b3=1\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\nImplied Volatility\n\nImplied Volatility\n\n0.7\n\n0.4\n0.3\n1\n\n0.2\n\u22120.4\n\n0.8\n\u22120.3\n\n0.6\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0.45\n0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0.1\n\n0\n\nRisk Aversion \u03b3\n\nLog Moneyness\n\n0.2\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.35\n\n\u22120.3\n\n\u22120.25\n\n\u22120.2 \u22120.15 \u22120.1\nLog Moneyness\n\n\u22120.05\n\n0\n\nFigure 4: Implied volatility from the arctangent stochastic volatility model in terms of log-moneyness\nlog(K/S 0 ) and \u03b3 with fixed \u03b7 = 0.2.\n\n17\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n\f5 Proofs\nPrice- and Volatility Bounds\nLemma 5.1 (First Price Comparison).

Even if the form of this comparison principle for sub- and superprices seems to be quite unusual, the\nproof follows directly along the lines of Friedman [Fri64, Theorem 2.16] since the functions \u011d contains no\nsecond derivatives. To be precise: this argument leads a version where the inequalities in (40), (42) and the\n\u03b5\nconclusion are strict. But setting P = P + \u03b5(1 + \u03c4) one gets a strict superprice and sending \u03b5 to zero yields\nthe stated version.\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition 2.10:\nProof. To prove (18), we intend to invoke the above comparison principle for the price process given in\nTheorem 2.9 since it is clear that the Black-Scholes pricing functions are sub- resp. supersolutions of the\nPDE. Unfortunately we have the indifference price only as solution of a Dirichlet problem which does not\ngive rise to directly comparable lateral boundary conditions. thus we have to alter the argument a bit.\nDenote for N \u2208 N by uN,\u03c3 the solution of the initial/boundary-value problems\n\uf8f1\nN,\u03c3\nN,\u03c3 \u0001\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212u\u03c4 + LuN,\u03c3 = K1 \u011d \u2212\u03bb(y), \u03c1\u2032 Ka(y)uy ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nuN,\u03c3 (0, x, y) = \u2212(1 \u2212 ex )+ ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 uN,\u03c3 (\u03c4, x, y)\n= \u2212PBS (\u03c4, x; \u03c3).\n\u2202B(0,N)\nBy a classical argument [LSU67, Section V.\u00a78], we can extract a subsequence uNk ,\u03c3 of uN,\u03c3 such that uNk ,\u03c3\nconverges together with its derivatives to u and it's derivatives pointwise in LT .

Thus we can use Lemma 5.3 to infer P(\u03c4, x, y) \u2264 P(\u03c4, x, y) \u2264 P(\u03c4, x, y) in Q\u03c40 ,r and the strict\nmonotonicity of the function U in the first component yields the result.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 2.12:\n\n20\n\n\fProof. Remark first that if there exists a solution to the PDE with some fixed initial condition, it has to be\nunique by the smoothness and strict monotonicity of U (and the boundedness of I proven in Proposition\n2.10) since otherwise the solution of the pricing PDE (Theorem 2.9) would not be unique. By the same\nreasoning we get also I \u2208 C 1+\u03b2/2,2+\u03b2 (QT,r ) \u2229 C(LT ). Moreover, the eikonal equation (25) has a unique\nviscosity solution as proved in [BBF04, Section 3.2]. To prove the theorem we will hence show that the\nsolution of the eikonal equation is the only possible initial condition, i.e. that any solution of the PDE (24)\nhas the eikonal equation as it's small time limit. More precisely we will show that there exist parametrized\nfamilies of (time-independent) local super- and subsolutions of (24) which converge locally uniformly to\nthe eikonal equation. This is done quite similar as in [BBF04, Section 3.4.], using an adapted vanishing\nviscosity method. However, in our setting the bounds on the volatility \u03c3 enable us to simplify the proof and\ncircumvent some obscurities in the local volatility argument in [BBF04].\n\u03b5,\u03b4\nDefine I (x, y) for \u03b5, \u03b4 > 0 as the solution of\n\uf8f1\n\u03b5,\u03b4 \u0001\n\u03b5,\u03b4 \u0001\n\u03b5,\u03b4 \u0001\n\uf8f4\nx\n\uf8f4\n\u2212\u03b4 = \u2212 I 2 + I 2 G \u03b5,\u03b4\n+ \u03b5\u2206 ln (I ) ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nI\n(50)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 I \u03b5,\u03b4\n\uf8f3\n= \u03c3.\n\u2202B(m,r)\n\nwhere B(m, r) is an arbitrary disk.

Thus we have\n\u03b5,\u03b4\n\nI \u03b5,\u03b4 (x, y) \u2264 lim inf I(\u03c4, x, y) \u2264 lim sup I(\u03c4, x, y) \u2264 I (x, y).\n\u03c4\u21920\n\n\u03c4\u21920\n\n\u03b5,\u03b4\n\n\u03b5,\u03b4\nNext we want to send \u03b5 to zero.\nTherefore\n\u221a\n\u221a we note that the families of solutions I , I are uniformly\nbounded (by the constants \u03b4 \u2228 \u03c3 and \u03b4 \u2227 \u03c3 as a consequence of the comparison principle [GT01,\nTheorem 10.7.(i)] applied to the equations in the log-variables) and equicontinuous in \u03b5 (since H\u00f6lder\u03b5,\u03b4\ncontinuous with the same H\u00f6lder constants). Thus by the Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli theorem I converges along a\n\u03b4\nsubsequence uniformly on compacts to some limit function I \u2208 C 0+\u03b2 (Q\u03c40 ,r ). This function is a viscosity\nsolution of the PDE\n\uf8f1\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\u0001\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212\u03b4 = \u2212(I )2 + I 2 G x\u03b4 ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nI\n\uf8f4\n\u03b4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 I\n= \u03c3.\n\u2202B(m,r)\n\nAn analogous result holds true for the subsolutions. Now sending \u03b4 \u2192 0, this gives by the same argument a\nsolution of the PDE\nx\nG 0 =1\nI\n\nwhich satisfies I(0, y) = 0. Thus for \u03c4 \u2192 0, I(\u03c4, x, y) converges locally uniformly to I 0 which is nothing else\nthan the (by [BBF04, Section 3.2] unique) viscosity solution of the eikonal equation (25) with \u03c8 = x/I 0 . \u0003\n\nReferences\n[ADEH99] P.
