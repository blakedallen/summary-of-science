In this work we show that the parallel (to the uniform\nunperturbed magnetic field) electric field generation can be obtained in much simpler framework\nusing ideal Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description, i.e. without resorting to complicated wave\nparticle interaction effects such as ion polarisation drift and resulting space charge separation which\nseems to be an ultimate cause of the electron acceleration. In the ideal MHD the parallel (to the\nuniform unperturbed magnetic field) electric field appears due to fast magnetosonic waves which\nare generated by the interaction of weakly non-linear Alfv\u00e9n waves with the transverse density\ninhomogeneity. Further, in the context of the coronal heating problem a new two stage mechanism of\nthe plasma heating is presented by putting emphasis, first, on the generation of parallel electric fields\nwithin ideal MHD description directly, rather than focusing on the enhanced dissipation mechanisms\nof the Alfv\u00e9n waves and, second, dissipation of these parallel electric fields via kinetic effects. It\nis shown that a single Alfv\u00e9n wave harmonic with frequency (\u03bd = 7 Hz), (which has longitudinal\nwavelength \u03bbA = 0.63 Mm for putative Alfv\u00e9n speed of 4328 km s\u22121 ) the generated parallel electric\nfield could account for the 10% of the necessary coronal heating requirement. We conjecture that\nwide spectrum (10\u22124 \u2212 103 Hz) Alfv\u00e9n waves, based on observationally constrained spectrum, could\nprovide necessary coronal heating requirement. It is also shown that the amplitude of generated\nparallel electric field exceeds the Dreicer electric field by about four orders of magnitude, which\nimplies realisation of the run-away regime with the associated electron acceleration.\nPACS numbers: 96.60.-j;96.60.P-;96.60.pc;96.60.pf;96.50.Tf\n\nDuring the total solar eclipse of August 7, 1869, Harkness and Young discovered an emission line of feeble intensity in the green part of the spectrum of the corona.\nSimilarly to the case of Helium discovered by Sir Norman Lockyer in 1868 it was mistakenly proposed that\nthis line was due to an unknown element, provisionally\nnamed coronium. It was only in 1939 when Grotrian\nand Edlen correctly identified it as an emission produced\nby highly ionised Iron at temperatures of a few \u00d7106\nK. Physical understanding of this high temperature in\nthe solar corona is still a fundamental problem in astrophysics. None of the existing models can simultaneously\naccount for all the observational and physical requirements in order to explain what is known as the coronal\nheating problem.\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that: It is\nnot possible for heat to flow from a colder body to a\nwarmer body without any work having been done to accomplish this flow. Or energy will not flow spontaneously\nfrom a low temperature object to a higher temperature\nobject. This seems to be in apparent contradiction with\nwhat we see in the solar atmosphere where temperature\nsteeply rises from the photospheric boundary which is\nat T = 5785 K to a few \u00d7106 K i.e. an increase of a\nfactor of 200. The transition region between the chromosphere (a thin layer above photosphere) and the hot\ncorona over which the temperature increases dramatically is extremely thin (\u2248 0.01 % of the Sun's diameter).\nThis implies that some intense heat deposition occurs in\nthe corona such that the second law of thermodynamics\ncan be saved.\n\nThe temperature structure of the solar corona is far\nfrom homogeneous [1]. The optically thin emission from\nthe corona in soft X-rays or in the extreme ultra violet implies over-dense structures: so called coronal loops\n(closed magnetic structures) or plumes in polar regions\n(open magnetic structures) amongst others. In the\ncorona the thermal pressure is generally much smaller\nthan the magnetic pressure so that their ratio which is\nknown as plasma-\u03b2 parameter is \u226a 1. This implies that\nin the corona substantial amount of energy is stored in\nthe magnetic field. In turn, if one could devise a mechanism how this energy is released (dissipated), then important clues to the solution of the coronal heating problem\nwould be revealed.\nThe coronal heating models are subdivided according\nto the possibilities of how the currents that are responsible for the plasma heating are dissipated: either by\nmagnetic reconnection [2, 3, 4], Ohmic dissipation via\ncurrent cascading [5, 6], and viscous turbulence [7] in\nthe case of so called DC models [1], or by Alfv\u00e9nic resonance, i.e. resonant absorption [8, 9, 10, 11], phase\nmixing [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], and\nturbulence [23] in the case of AC models. An interesting\nalternative to all of the above models was explored in\n[24], where coronal loops could be heated by the flow of\nsolar wind plasma (plus other flows that may be present)\nacross them by generating currents in a similar manner as\na conventional Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator.\nHistorically all phase mixing studies have been performed in the Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation, however, since the transverse scales in the Alfv\u00e9n\n\n\f2\nwave collapse progressively to zero, the MHD approximation is inevitably violated. Thus, Refs.[21, 22] studied\nthe phase mixing effect in the kinetic regime, i.e. beyond\na MHD approximation, where a new mechanism for the\nacceleration of electrons due to the generation of parallel\nelectric field in the solar coronal context was discovered.\nThis mechanism has important implications for various\nspace and laboratory plasmas, e.g. the coronal heating\nproblem and acceleration of the solar wind. It turns out\nthat in the magnetospheric context similar parallel electric field generation mechanism in the transversely inhomogeneous plasmas was reported before [25, 26] (see also\nthe comment letter [27] and references therein).\nContrary to the previous studies [21, 22, 25, 26], here\nwe use MHD description of the problem. Namely we\nsolve numerically ideal, 2.5D, MHD equations in Cartesian coordinates, with plasma \u03b2 = 0.0001 starting from\nthe following equilibrium configuration: A uniform magnetic field B0 in the z\u2212direction penetrates plasma with\nthe density inhomogeneity across x\u2212direction, which is\nvarying such that it increases from some reference background value of \u03c10 , which in our case was fixed at\n\u03c10 = 2 \u00d7 109 \u03bcmp g cm\u22123 (with molecular weight of\n\u03bc = 1.27 corresponding to the solar coronal conditions\n1\nH:4 He=10:1 [1] and mp being the proton mass), to 5\u03c10 .\nSuch density profile across the magnetic field has steep\ngradients with half-width of 3 Mm around x \u2243 \u00b110 Mm\nand is essentially flat elsewhere. Here \"M\" in units stands\nfor mega i.e. 106 . Such a structure mimics e.g. footpoint of a large curvature radius solar coronal loop or\na polar region plume with the ratio of density inhomogeneity scale and the loop/plume radius of 0.3, which is\na median value of the observed range 0.15 - 0.5 [28]. We\nuse the following usual normalisation Bx,y,z = B0 B\u0304x,y,z ,\n(x, y, z) = a0 (x\u0304, \u0233, z\u0304), t = (a0 /c0A )t\u0304. Here B0 we fix\u221a\nat 100\nG, and hence dimensional Alfv\u00e9n speed, c0A = B0 / 4\u03c0\u03c10\nturns out to be 4328 km s\u22121 =0.0144 c (c is the speed of\nlight). The reference length a0 was fixed at 1 Mm, i.e.\ndimensionless time of unity corresponds to 0.2311 s. We\nusually omit bar on top of normalised quantities, hence\nwhen simply numbers are quoted without units, in such\ncircumstances we refer to dimensionless units as defined\nabove. The dimensionless Alfv\u00e9n speed is normalised to\nc0A . The simulation domain spans from \u221240Mm to 40\nMm in both x\u2212 and z\u2212directions with the density ramp\nas described above mimicking a footpoint fragment of a\nsolar coronal loop or a polar region plume. Our initial\nequilibrium is depicted in Fig. 1.\nThe initial conditions for the numerical simulation are\nBy = A cos(kz) and Vy = \u2212cA (x)By at t = 0, which\nmeans that purely Alfv\u00e9nic, linearly polarised, plane\nwave is launched travelling in the direction of positive\nz's. The rest of physical quantities, namely, Vx and Bx\n(which would be components of fast magnetosonic wave\nif the medium were totally homogeneous) and Vz and\nBz (the analogs of slow magnetosonic wave) are initially\nset to zero. Plasma temperature is varied as inverse of\ndensity so that the total (thermal plus magnetic) pres-\n\nsure always remains constant. We fixed the amplitude of\nAlfv\u00e9n wave A at 0.05. This choice makes Alfv\u00e9n wave\nweakly non-linear.\nThe models of coronal heating using wave dissipation\nwere focusing on the mechanisms (e.g. phase mixing)\nthat could enhance damping of the Alfv\u00e9n waves. However for the coronal value of shear (Braginskii) viscosity,\nby which Alfv\u00e9n waves damp of about \u03b7 = 1 m2 s\u22121 ,\ntypical dissipation lengths (e-fold decrease of Alfv\u00e9n wave\namplitude over that lengths) are \u2243 1000 Mm, only invoking somewhat ad hoc concept of so called enhanced resistivity can bring down the dissipation length to a required\nvalue of the order of hydrodynamic pressure scale height\n\u03bbT \u2248 50 Mm. In this light (observation of mostly undamped Alfv\u00e9n waves [29] (see however Ref.[30]) and inability of classical (Braginskii) viscosity producing short\nenough dissipation length), it seems reasonable to focus\nrather on the generation of parallel electric fields which\nwould guarantee plasma heating should the energy density of the parallel electric fields be large enough. We\nput emphasis on parallel electric fields because in the direction parallel to the magnetic field electrons (and protons) are not constrained. While in the perpendicular to\nthe magnetic field direction particles are constrained because of large classical conductivity \u03c3 = 6 \u00d7 1016 s\u22121 (for\nT = 2M K corona) and inhibited momentum transport\nacross the magnetic field.\nIn the MHD limit there are no parallel electric fields\nassociated with the Alfv\u00e9n wave. In the single fluid, ideal\nMHD (which is justified because of large \u03c3) the parallel\n(to the uniform unperturbed magnetic field) electric field\ncan be obtained from\nVx By \u2212 Vy Bx\nEz = \u2212\n.\n(1)\nc\nThis means that in the considered system Ez can only\nbe generated if the initial Alfv\u00e9n wave (Vy , By ) is able to\ngenerate fast magnetosonic wave (Vx , Bx ).\nIn the recent past, in the context other than parallel electric field generation, Ref. [13] investigated just\nsuch a possibility of growth of fast magnetosonic waves\nin a similar physical system. They used mostly analytical approach and focused on the early stages of the system's evolution. Later, long term evolution of the fast\nmagnetosonic wave generation was studied numerically\nin the case of harmonic [15] and Gaussian [16] Alfv\u00e9nic\ninitial perturbations. When fast magnetoacoustic perturbations are initially absent and the initial amplitude of\nthe plane Alfv\u00e9n wave is small, the subsequent evolution\nof the wave, due to the difference in local Alfv\u00e9n speed\nacross the x-coordinate, leads to the distortion of the\nwave front. This leads to the appearance of transverse\n(with respect to the applied magnetic field) gradients,\nwhich grow linearly with time. The main negative outcome of the studies with the harmonic [15] and Gaussian\n[16] Alfv\u00e9nic initial perturbations was that the amplitudes of Vx and Bx after rapid initial growth actually\ntend to saturate due to the destructive wave interference\neffect [16].\n\n\f3\nWe used fully non-linear MHD code Lare2d with\nthe initial conditions as described above. As a selfconsistency test we performed numerical simulations with\nmoderate values of k = 1 (in dimensional units this corresponds to an Alfv\u00e9n wave with frequency (\u03bd = 0.7 Hz),\ni.e. longitudinal wave-numbers \u03bbA = 6.3 Mm) and corroborated previous results of [15, 16].\nIn Fig. (2) we show two snapshots of Vx and Ez (the\nlatter was reconstructed using Eq.(1)) for the case of\nk = 10 (in dimensional units this corresponds to an\nAlfv\u00e9n wave with frequency (\u03bd = 7 Hz), i.e. longitudinal wave-number \u03bbA = 0.63 Mm.). It can be seen\nthat the fast magnetosonic wave (Vx ) and parallel electric field (Ez ) are both generated in the vicinity of the\ndensity gradients x \u2243 \u00b110, eventually filling the entire\ndensity ramp. This means the generated parallel electric\nfields are confined by the density gradients, i.e. the solar coronal loop (which the considered systems tries to\nmimic) after about 20 Alfv\u00e9n time scales becomes filled\nwith the oscillatory in time parallel electric fields. Also,\nas in [21] and [25], the generated parallel electric field\nis quite spiky, but more importantly it seems that large\nwave-numbers (and frequencies) i.e. short wavelength\nnow are capable to significantly increase the amplitudes\nof generated both fast magnetosonic waves (Vx ) and parallel electric field Ez shown in Fig. (3). In Fig. (3) we\nplot the amplitudes of Vx \u2261 Vxa and Ez \u2261 Eza which\nwe define as the maxima of absolute values of the wave\namplitudes along x \u2243 \u00b110 line (which essentially track\nthe generated wave amplitudes in the strongest density\ngradient regions) at a given time step. This amplitude\ngrowth is beyond simple A2 scaling (cf. [16]). In the\nconsidered case Ez now attains values of 0.001. To verify\nthe convergence of the solution, we plot the results of the\nnumerical run with the doubled (4000 \u00d7 4000) spatial resolution. The match seems satisfactory, which validates\nthe obtained results. One could argue that at first sight,\nthe obtained spikes in both fast magnetosonic waves (Vx )\nand parallel electric field Ez do not contain much energy\nas they are localised strongly in the wavefront. However,\none should realise that in Fig. (2) case of a single harmonic with 7 Hz is considered. If one considers a wide\nspectrum of Alfv\u00e9n waves (see discussion of this conjecture below), then the harmonics with different frequencies will contribute to the generation of what will then\nbe a \"forest\" of such spikes (for each harmonic). Also, as\nthe frequency of Alfv\u00e9n waves decreases than much more\nregular (no longer spiky) wave structures are observed for\nboth fast magnetosonic waves (Vx ) and parallel electric\nfield Ez . To demonstrate this point we present intensity\nplots of Vx and Ez at 20 for the case of k = 1, \u03bd = 0.7\nHz, \u03bbA = 6.3 Mm in Fig. 4. In the latter case the amplitude of Vx saturates at A2 = 0.052 = 0.0025 as one\nmight expect from the weakly non-linear theory, while\nEz at 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nIt has been know for decades [31] that the coronal energy losses that need to be compensated by some additional energy input, to keep solar corona to the observed\n\ntemperatures, are as following (in units of erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ):\n3 \u00d7 105 for quiet Sun, 8 \u00d7 105 for a coronal hole and 107\nfor an active region. Ref.[1] makes similar estimates for\nthe heating flux per unit area (i.e. in erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ):\n\u0010 n \u00112 \u0012 T \u0013\ne\nFH = EH \u03bbT = 5 \u00d7 103\n, (2)\n108 cm\n1MK\nwhere EH \u2248 10\u22126 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . This yields an estimate\nof FH \u2248 2 \u00d7 106 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in an active region of the\ncorona with a typical loop base electron number density\nof ne = 2 \u00d7 109 cm\u22123 and T = 1 MK.\nIn order to make appropriate estimates we first note\nthat the energy density associated with the parallel electric field Ez is EE = \u03b5Ez2 /(8\u03c0) erg cm\u22123 , where \u03b5 is the\ndielectric permittivity of plasma. The latter can be calculated from \u03b5 = (4\u03c0\u03c1c2 )/B 2 . This expression for \u03b5 is\ndifferent from the usual expression for the dielectric permittivity [32]: \u03b5 = 1 + (4\u03c0\u03c1c2 )/B 2 because the displacement current has been neglected in the above treatment,\nwhich is a usual assumption made in the MHD limit.\nAt any rate for the coronal conditions (\u03c1 = 2 \u00d7 109 \u03bcmp\ng cm\u22123 , \u03bc = 1.27, B = 100 Gauss) the second term\n(4\u03c0\u03c1c2 )/B 2 = 4.8048 \u00d7 103 \u2248 \u03b5 \u226b 1. \u00bfFrom Fig. (3) we\ngather that the parallel electric field amplitude attains\nvalue of \u2248 0.001. In order to convert this to dimensional units we use c0A = 4328 km s\u22121 and B = 100 G\nand Eq.(1) to obtain Ez \u2248 (c0A B/c) \u00d7 0.001 = 0.0014\nstatvolt cm\u22121 (in Gaussian units). Therefore the energy\ndensity associated with the parallel electric field Ez is\nEE = (4.8048 \u00d7 103 ) \u00d7 0.00142/(8\u03c0) = 3.7471 \u00d7 10\u22124\nerg cm\u22123 . In order to get the heating flux per unit area\nfor a single harmonic with frequency 7 Hz, we multiply\nthe latter expression by the Alfv\u00e9n speed of 4328 km s\u22121\n(this is natural step because the fast magnetosonic waves\n(Vx and Bx ) which propagate across the magnetic field\nand associated parallel electric fields (Ez ) are generated\non density gradients by the Alfv\u00e9n waves. Hence, the\nflux is carried with the Alfv\u00e9n speed) to obtain\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(3)\nFE = EE c0A = 1.62 \u00d7 105 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\nwhich is \u2248 10 % of the coronal heating requirement estimate for the same parameters made above using Eq.(2).\nNote that the latter estimate is for a single harmonic with\nfrequency 7 Hz (see discussion below for details when a\nwide spectrum of Alfv\u00e9n waves is considered).\nWe now discuss how the energy stored in the generated\nparallel electric field is dissipated. For this purpose the\nparallel electric field behaviour at a given point in space\n(as a function of time) was studied. We found that Ez (in\nthe point of strongest density gradient) is periodic (signchanging) function which is a mixture of two harmonics\nwith frequencies \u03c9 = cA k and \u03c9 = 2cA k. This can be\nqualitatively explained by the fact that Ez is calculated\nusing Eq.(1) where Vy and By at fixed spatial point vary\nin time with frequencies \u03c9 = cA k, while the generated\nVx and Bx do so with frequencies \u03c9 = 2cA k [13]. Under\ninfluence of such periodic parallel electric field electrons\n\n\f4\nstart oscillations and are accelerated (while ions perhaps\nare not due to their larger inertia). It should be emphasised that because of the ideal MHD approximation used\nin this letter, strictly speaking the generated electric field\ncannot accelerate plasma particles or cause Ohmic heating unless kinetic effects are invoked. Let us look at the\nOhm's law for ideal MHD (Eq.(1)) in more detail denoting unperturbed by the waves physical quantities with\nsubscript 0 and the ones associated with the waves by\n~0 = V\n~0 = 0 with\na prime: Initial equilibrium implies E\n~ 0 6= 0. For the perturbed state (with Alfv\u00e9n waves\nB\n(Vy and By ) launched which generate fast magnetosonic\nwaves (Vx and Bx ) ) we have\n~ \u2032 = \u2212V\n~ \u2032 \u00d7 (B\n~0 + B\n~ \u2032 )/c\nE\n\n(4)\n\n~ \u2032 on full magnetic field (unNote that the projection of E\n~ 0 plus the waves B\n~ \u2032 ) is zero by the definition\nperturbed B\n~\n~ 0 +B\n~ \u2032 )/|(B\n~ 0 +B\n~ \u2032 )| = 0.\nof cross and scalar product: E \u2032 *(B\nPhysically this means that in ideal MHD electric field\ncannot do any work as it is always perpendicular to the\nfull (background plus wave) magnetic field. However the\n~ \u2032 on unperturbed magnetic field B\n~ 0 is\nprojection of E\nclearly non-zero\n~\n~ \u2032 ~\u2032 ~\n~ \u2032 * B0 = Ez = \u2212 V \u00d7 B * B0\nE\n~ 0|\n~ 0|\nc\n|B\n|B\n\n(5)\n\nwhich exactly coincides with Eq.(1) that was used to\ncalculate Ez throughout this letter. Crucial next step\nneeded to understand how the generated parallel (to the\nuniform unperturbed magnetic field) electric fields dissipate must invoke kinetic effects. In our two stage model,\nin the first stage bulk MHD motions (waves) are generating the parallel electric fields, which as we saw cannot\naccelerate particles if we describe plasmas in the ideal\nMHD limit. Clearly we witnessed in works of G\u00e9not\net al. [25] and Tsiklauri et al. [21] that when identical\nsystem is modelled in kinetic regime particles are indeed\naccelerated with such parallel fields. G\u00e9not et al. [25]\nclaimed that electron acceleration is due to the polarisation drift. In particular, they showed that once Alfv\u00e9n\nwave propagates on the transverse to the magnetic field\ndensity gradient, parallel electric field is generated due\nto charge separation caused by the polarisation drift associated with the time varying electric field of the Alfv\u00e9n\nwave. Because polarisation drift speed is proportional\nto the mass of the particle, it is negligible for electrons,\nhence ions start to drift. This causes charge separation\n(the effect that is certainly beyond reach of MHD description), which results in generation of the parallel electric\nfields, that in turn accelerates electrons. In the MHD\nconsideration our parallel electric field is also time varying, hence at the second (kinetic) stage the electron acceleration can proceed in the same manner through the\nion polarisation drift and charge separation. The exact\npicture of the particle dynamics in this case can no longer\nbe treated with MHD and kinetic description is more rel-\n\nevant. It should be mentioned that the frequencies considered in kinetic regime [21], \u03bd = 0.3\u03c9ci /(2\u03c0) = 4.6\u00d7104\nHz and this letter, 0.7\u22127 Hz, are different, but we clearly\nsaw that the increase in frequency just yields enhancement of the parallel electric field generation. Various effects of wave-particle interactions will rapidly damp the\nparallel electric fields on a time scale much shorter than\nMHD time scale. G\u00e9not et al. [25] clearly demonstrated\nthe role of nonlinearity and kinetic instabilities in the\nrapid conversion from initial low frequency electromagnetic regime, to a high frequency electrostatic one. They\nidentified Buneman and weak beam plasma instabilities\nin their simulations (as they studied time evolution of\nthe system for longer than Tsiklauri et al. [21] times).\nFig.(11) from G\u00e9not et al. [25] shows that wave energy\nis converted into particle energy on the times scales of\n\u22121\n103 \u03c9pe\n\u2248 4 Alfv\u00e9n periods. Perhaps no immediate comparison is possible (because of the different frequencies\ninvolved), but still in our case Alfv\u00e9n period when sufficient energy is stored in the parallel electric field is 1/(7\nHz)=0.14 s, i.e. wave energy is converted into the particle\nenergy in quite short time.\nOur aim here was to show that parallel electric field\ngeneration is possible even within the MHD framework\nwithout resorting to plasma kinetics. Yet another important observation can be made by estimating the Dreicer\nelectric field [33]. Dreicer considered dynamics of electrons under action of two effects: the parallel electric\nfield and friction between electrons and ions. He noted\nthat the equation describing electron dynamics along the\nmagnetic field can be written as\nme v \u0307d = eE \u2212 \u03bdpe/i me vd\n\n(6)\ne/i\n\nwhere vd is the electron drift velocity and \u03bdp is the electron collision frequency and dot denotes time derivative.\nWe note in passing that when vd \u226a vthermal Eq.(6) in\nthe steady state regime (d/dt = 0) allows to derive the\nexpression for Spitzer resistivity. When vd > vthermal\nthen steady state solution may not apply. In this case\nwhen the right hand side of Eq.(6) is positive i.e. when\ne/i\neE > \u03bdp me vd , we have electron acceleration. In fact\nthis is so called run-away regime. In simple terms acceleration due to parallel electric field leads to an ine/i\ncrease in vd , in turn, this leads to decrease in \u03bdp because\ne/i\n\u03bdp \u221d 1/vd3 . In other words when electric field exceeds\nthe critical value Ed = ne e3 ln \u039b/(8\u03c0\u03b520 kB T ) (the Dreicer electric field, which is quoted here in SI form), faster\ndrift leads to decrease in electron-ion friction, which in\nturn results in even faster drift speed and hence run-away\nregime is reached. Putting in coronal values (ne = 2\u00d7109\ncm\u22123 , T = 1 MK and ln \u039b = 17.75) in the expression for\nthe Dreicer electric field we obtain 0.0054 V m\u22121 which\nin Gaussian units is 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22127 statvolt cm\u22121 . As can be\nseen from this estimate the values of parallel electric field\nobtained in this letter exceeds the Dreicer electric field\nby about four orders of magnitude! This guarantees that\nran-away regime would take place leading to the electron\n\n\f5\nacceleration and fast conversion of the generated electric\nfield energy in to heat. It should be noted, however, that\nin Eq.(6) E is constant, while our Ez in the point of\nstrongest density gradient is time varying. Hence some\nmodification from the Dreicer analysis is expected.\nIt has been known for decades that the flux carried by\nAlfv\u00e9n waves in the solar corona is more than enough\nto heat it to the observed temperatures [31], however\nlinear MHD Alfv\u00e9n waves in homogeneous plasma do not\npossess parallel electric field component. This is one of\nthe reasons why they are so difficult to dissipate. Hence\nthe novelty of this study was to consider situation when\nparallel electric field generation is possible (weak nonlinearity and transverse density inhomogeneity).\nAfter comment paper by Mottez et al. [27] we came\nto realisation that electron acceleration seen in both series of works [21, 22, 25, 26] is a non-resonant waveparticle interaction effect. In works by Tsiklauri et al.\n[21, 22] electron thermal speed was vth,e = 0.1c while\nAlfv\u00e9n speed in the strongest density gradient regions was\nvA = 0.16c, this unfortunate coincidence led us then to\nthe conclusion that the electron acceleration by parallel\nelectric fields was affected by the Landau resonance with\nthe phase mixed Alfv\u00e9n wave. In works by [25, 26] electron thermal speed was vth,e = 0.1c while Alfv\u00e9n speed\nwas vA = 0.4c because they considered more strongly\nmagnetised plasma applicable to Earth magnetospheric\nconditions. There were three main stages that lead to\nthe formulation of the present model.\n(i) The realisation of the parallel electric field generation (and particle acceleration) being a non-resonant\nwave-particle interaction effect, lead us to a question:\ncould such parallel electric fields be generated in MHD\napproximation?\n(ii) Next we realised that indeed if one considers\nnon-linear generation of fast magnetosonic waves in the\n~ =\nplasma with transverse density inhomogeneity, then E\n~\n~\n\u2212(V \u00d7 B)/c contains non-zero component parallel to the\nambient magnetic field Ez = \u2212(Vx By \u2212 Vy Bx )/c.\n(iii) From previous studies [15, 16] we knew that the\nfast magnetosonic waves (Vx and Bx ) did not grow to a\nsubstantial fraction of the Alfv\u00e9n wave amplitude. However after reproducing old parameter regime (k=1, i.e frequency of 0.7 Hz), fortunately case of k=10, i.e frequency\nof 7 Hz was considered, which showed that fast magnetosonic waves and in turn parallel electric field were more\nefficiently generated.\nWe close this letter with the following four points:\n(i) In this work we showed that the parallel electric\nfield generation reported in number of previous publications [21, 22, 25, 26] which dealt with transversely inhomogeneous plasma can be explained in much simpler\nframework using MHD description, i.e. without resorting\nto complicated wave particle interaction effects.\n(ii) In the context of the coronal heating problem a\nnew two stage mechanism of the plasma heating is presented by putting emphasis, first, on the generation of\nparallel electric fields within ideal MHD description di-\n\nrectly, rather than focusing on the enhanced dissipation\nmechanisms of the Alfv\u00e9n waves and, second, dissipation\nof these parallel electric fields via kinetic effects.\n(iii) It is shown that a single Alfv\u00e9n wave harmonic\nwith frequency (\u03bd = 7 Hz), (which has longitudinal wavelength \u03bbA = 0.63 Mm for putative Alfv\u00e9n speed of 4328\nkm s\u22121 ) the generated parallel electric field could account\nfor the 10% of the necessary coronal heating requirement.\nWe conjecture that the wide spectrum (10\u22124 \u2212 103 Hz)\nAlfv\u00e9n waves, based on observationally constrained spectrum, could provide necessary coronal heating requirement. In this regard, it should mentioned that Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves as observed in situ in the solar wind always appear\nto be propagating away from the Sun and it is therefore\nnatural to assume a solar origin for these fluctuations.\nHowever, the precise origin in the solar atmosphere of the\nhypothetical source spectrum for Alfv\u00e9nic waves (turbulence) is unknown, given the impossibility of remote magnetic field observations above the chromosphere-corona\ntransition region [34]. Studies of ion cyclotron resonance\nheating of the solar corona and high speed winds exist which provide important spectroscopic constraints on\nthe Alfv\u00e9n wave spectrum [35]. Although the spectrum\ncan and is observed at distances of 0.3 AU, it can be\nthen projected back at the base of corona using empirical constraints, see e.g. top line in Fig. 5 from Cranmer et al. [35]. Using the latter figure we can make\nthe following estimates. Let us look at single harmonic,\nfirst. At frequency 7 Hz (used in our simulations) mag(7 Hz)\nnetic energy of Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations is E\u03bd\n\u2248 107 nT2\n\u22121\nHz . For single harmonic with \u03bd = 7 Hz this gives for\n(7 Hz)\n/(8\u03c0) \u2248 7 \u00d7 10\u22123\nthe energy density E (7 Hz) \u2261 \u03bdE\u03bd\n2\n\u22124\n\u22123\nG /(8\u03c0) \u2248 2.8 \u00d7 10 erg cm . Note that surprisingly\nthis semi-observational value is quite close to our theoretical value of 3.7471 \u00d7 10\u22124 erg cm\u22123 ! As we saw above\nsuch single harmonic can provide approximately 10 % of\nthe coronal heating requirement. Next let us look at how\nmuch energy density is stored in Alfv\u00e9n wave spectrum\nbased on empirically guided top line in Fig. 5 from Cranmer et al. [35]. Their spectral energy density (which they\ncall \"power\") is approximated by so called 1/f spectrum,\ni.e. E\u03bd = 0.6 \u00d7 108 /\u03bd nT2 Hz\u22121 . Which in proper energy density units is E\u03bd = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 /\u03bd erg cm\u22123 Hz \u22121 .\nHence the flux carried by Alfv\u00e9n waves from say 10\u22124 Hz\nup to a frequency \u03bd would be\nZ \u03bd\nAW\nF\n=\nE\u03bd c0A d\u03bd = 1.04 \u00d7 105 ln(\u03bd/10\u22124 ) (7)\n10\u22124 Hz\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . Based on the latter equation we deduce\nthat the Alfv\u00e9n wave spectrum from \u03bd = 10\u22124 Hz up to\nabout few \u00d7103 Hz carries a flux that is nearly as much\nas the coronal heating requirement, FH \u2248 2 \u00d7 106 erg\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 , quoted above. We refrain from considering\nhigher frequencies because for about 104 Hz ions become\nresonant with circularly polarised Alfv\u00e9n waves and the\ndissipation proceeds through the Landau resonance \u2013 the\nwell studied mechanism, but quite different from our nonresonant mechanism of parallel electric field generation.\n\n\f6\nThere are several possibilities how this flux carried by\nAlfv\u00e9n waves (fluctuations), is dissipated. If we consider\nregime of frequencies up to 103 Hz, ion cyclotron resonance condition is not met and hence dissipation would\nbe dominated through the mechanism of parallel electric\nfield dissipation formulated in this letter. However at\nthis stage it is unclear how much energy could actually\nbe dissipated. This is due to the fact that we only have\ntwo points 0.7 Hz and 7 Hz in our \"theoretical spectrum\".\nAs we saw a single Alfv\u00e9n wave harmonic with frequency\n7 Hz can dissipate enough heat to account for 10% of the\ncoronal heating requirement. Therefore, we conjecture\nthat wide spectrum (10\u22124 \u2212 103 Hz) Alfv\u00e9n waves, based\non observationally constrained spectrum, could provide\nnecessary coronal heating requirement. More details on\n\nthe issue of wide spectrum will be published elsewhere\n[36].\n(iv) The obtained value of the generated parallel electric field exceeds the Dreicer electric field by about four\norders of magnitude, which implies realisation of the runaway regime with the associated electron acceleration.\nacknowledgements Author kindly acknowledges support\nfrom the Nuffield Foundation (UK) through an award to\nnewly appointed lecturers in Science, Engineering and\nMathematics (NUF-NAL 04) and from the University of\nSalford Research Investment Fund 2005 grant.
