A distinguishing feature of molecular motor transport in eukaryotic cells is\nthat the motor proteins move on filamentary \"tracks\"\n[1, 2, 3, 4]. The tracks for motor proteins are made of\neither proteins or nucleic acids. Not all motor proteins\ncarry molecular cargo. A common feature of all these\nmotors is that these perform mechanical work by utilizing some other form of input energy and hence the name\n\"motor\". All the molecular motors we consider in this\npaper directly convert chemical energy into mechanical\nwork.\nDuring several biological processes many motors move\nsimultaneously on the same track. The collective movement of the motors under such cicumstances strongly\nresemble vehicular traffic flow [5, 6]. In this paper we\npresent few models of molecular motor traffic which, unlike earlier works of other groups, also capture the essential steps of the mechano-chemistry of individual motors.\nOur models of molecular motor traffic are biologically\nmotivated extensions of the totally asymmetric simple\nexclusion process (TASEP) [7]. A TASEP is defined in\nterms of \"rules\" for updating the states of the system:\na particle can move forward (with probability q) by one\nlattice specing if, and only if, the target site is empty.\nUpdating can be implemented either in parallel or in\nrandom-sequential manner; properties of the model depends on the updating scheme. For a finite system, either\n\n\u2217 Based on the invited talk delivered by DC at the IUPAP International Conference STATPHYS23, Genoa (Italy), July, 2007.\n\u2020 E-mail: debch@iitk.ac.in (Corresponding author)\n\nperiodic boundary conditions (PBC) or open boundary\nconditions (OBC) can be imposed. When the boundaries\nare open, at every time step, a particle can enter the system (and occupy the site j = 1) with probability \u03b1, if\nthe site j = 1 is empty. Similarly, under OBC, a particle occupying the site j = L can exit with probability\n\u03b2. TASEP under OBC shows an interesting phase diagram and is the prototype for so-called boundary-induced\nphase transitions [8]. To our knowledge, TASEP is the\nsimplest model of a system of interacting self-propelled\nparticles on a discrete lattice. It has been extended in\nseveral ways to formulate \"particle-hopping\" models for\ncapturing various interesting aspects of vehicular traffic\n[9].\nOur aim is to analyze molecular motor traffic from the\nperspective of vehicular traffic. Therefore, let us first list\nsome of the important quantities used in traffic science for\ncharacterizing traffic flow [9]. In the \"particle-hopping\"\nmodels of vehicular traffic each vehicle is represented by\na particle. The number of particles leaving a detector\nsite per unit time is defined as the flux and the relation\nbetween the average flux and the number density of the\nparticles is called the fundamental diagram.\nIn the particle-hopping models of vehicular traffic [9],\nthe time interval in between the departure of successive\nparticles from a detector site is defined as the time headway (TH). Let us start our clock as soon as a particle (let\nus label it by the integer j = 0) just leaves the detector\nwhose location is fixed. Suppose, the next n particles\nleave the same detector at times t1 , t2 , ...tn , respectively.\nThen, the corresponding THs are \u03c41 = t1 , \u03c42 = t2 \u2212 t1 ,\n\u03c43 = t3 \u2212 t2 ,..., \u03c4n = tn \u2212 tn\u22121 , respectively. The average flux (averaged over\n\u0013 interval tn ) is J = n/tn .\n\u0012 the time\nPn\nPn\nSince j=1 \u03c4j = tn ,\nj=1 \u03c4j /n = 1/J, i.e., the mean\n\n\f2\nTH is the inverse of the average flux; therefore, the distribution of the THs contains more detailed informations\non the flow characteristics of traffic than what is available\nfrom average flux [10, 11].\nThe average density-profile of the particles is yet another quantitative characteristic of TASEP and TASEPlike models. A more detailed characterization of the\nspatial-organization of the particles is possible in terms\nthe distribution of the distance-headways (DHs) where\nDH between two successive particles is defined to be the\nnumber of empty sites in between them [12, 13].\nIn our earlier papers on models of molecular motor\ntraffic [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] we reported results on average flux under both PBC and OBC as well as the average\ndensity profiles and the phase diagrams under OBC. In\na few cases [16, 19], we have also reported distributions\nof TH under OBC. In this paper, for each example of\nmolecular motor traffic, we briefly summarize the model\nand the fundamental diagram before presenting new results on the distributions of THs. We also briefly discuss\nour new observations on the distributions of DHs in these\nmodels. The TH distributions have important biological\nimplications and have been discussed in detail elsewhere\n[16, 19]. Three examples of molecular motor traffic are\nconsidered in the sections II, III and IV. The DH distributions in the models of molecular traffic are discussed\nbriefly in section V. Our summary and outlook is presented in section VI.\n\nII.\n\nTRAFFIC OF KINESINS ON\nMICROTUBULE TRACK\n\nMicrotubules and filamentous actin serve as the tracks\nfor cytoskeletal motors and both are made of proteins\n[1]. The members of the kinesin and dynein superfamilies of cytoskeletal motors move on microtubules (MT)\nwhereas those of the myosin superfamily move on actin\nfilaments. These motors run on chemical fuel in the sense\nthat the mechanical energy required for their movement\nis supplied from the energy released by the hydrolysis\nof adenosine triphosphate (ATP); the products of the\nhydrolysis reaction being adenosine diphosphate (ADP)\nand an inorganic phosphate [4].\nCytoskeletal motors can attach at any motor-binding\nsite on a MT track and can also detach from the track\n[1]. This distinct feature of the cytoskeletal motors was\ncaptured in the older TASEP-type models of molecular\nmotor traffic [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] by adding Langmuirlike attachment and detachment processes to the updating rules of TASEP. More specifically, in those models, a\nparticle is allowed not only to hop forward, but also to\n\"attach\" to any empty lattice site (with rate \u03c9a ), and\n\"detach\" from an occupied site (with rate \u03c9d ). In a\nwell-defined regime of parameters, this model exhibits\nco-existence of high-density and a low-density regions\nwhich are separated by a domain wall (shock); this type\nof spatio-temporal organization is interpreted as a jam\n\nin molecular motor traffic. But, since most of the effects\nof each mechano-chemical cycle of a motor is captured\nin these models through a single effective hopping rate\nq, it is difficult to make a direct quantitative comparison\nwith experimental data which depend on such chemical\nprocesses.\nWe have focussed attention on a family of singleheaded kinesins, called KIF1A. In order to develope a\nmodel for cytoskeletal motor traffic, which would not suffer from the limitations of the earlier TASEP-like models,\nwe have incorporated the essential steps of the mechanochemical cycle of individual KIF1A motors in our model.\nEach biochemical cycle of a KIF1A motor consists of a sequence of four states, namely, kinesin (K), kinesin bound\nwith ATP (KT), kinesin bound with ADP and phosphate\n(KDP) and, finally, kinesin bound with only ADP (KD).\nThe motor binds strongly to the MT track in both the\nstates K and KT; the state KDP has very short life time\nand KD binds weakly to the track. Therefore, at each\nspatial location in our simplified model, a KIF1A is allowed to exist in one of the two distinct \"chemical\" states\ndepending on whether it is bound strongly or weakly to\nthe track; these two chemical states are denoted by the\nsymbols S and W , respectively.\nThe allowed transitions and the corresponding rate\nconstants are shown in fig.1. The rate constants \u03c9a and\n\u03c9d account for the attachments and detachments of the\nmotors. The rate constant \u03c9b corresponds to the unbiased one-dimensional Brownian motion of the motor in\nthe state where it is weakly bound to the MT track. The\nrate constant \u03c9h is associated with the process driven by\nATP hydrolysis which causes the transition of the motor\nfrom the state S to the state W . The rate constants \u03c9f\nand \u03c9s , together, capture the Brownian ratchet mechanism of movement of a KIF1A motor [14, 15]. As in the\nearlier TASEP-type models of cytoskeletal motor traffic\n[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], none of the lattice sites is allowed\nto be occupied by more than one motor at a time.\nLet Si (t) and Wi (t) denote the probabilities of finding\nthe motor at location i in the strongly- and weakly-bound\nstates, respectively. The master equations for Si and Wi\nare given by [14]\ndSi\n= \u03c9s Wi + \u03c9f Wi\u22121 (1 \u2212 Si \u2212 Wi )\ndt\n+\u03c9a (1 \u2212 Si \u2212 Wi ) \u2212 \u03c9d Si \u2212 \u03c9h Si\n(1)\ndWi\n= \u03c9h Si + \u03c9b (Wi\u22121 + Wi+1 )(1 \u2212 Si \u2212 Wi )\ndt\n\u2212\u03c9s Wi \u2212 \u03c9f Wi (1 \u2212 Si+1 \u2212 Wi+1 )\n\u2212\u03c9b Wi (2 \u2212 Si+1 \u2212 Wi+1 \u2212 Si\u22121 \u2212 Wi\u22121 ).(2)\nSolving these equations in the steady state under PBC,\nwe get the flux\nJ=\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u03c9h\n\u03c9f \u03c1 (1 \u2212 \u03c1).\n\u03c9h + \u03c9s + \u03c9f (1 \u2212 \u03c1)\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic description of the mechano-chemical cycle\nof a single-headed kinesin motor KIF1A in our model.

The three curves correspond to three different values of \u03c9a (in the units of s\u22121 ). The other parameters are\n\u03c9d = 0.1s\u22121 , \u03c9h = 100s\u22121 , \u03c9s = 145s\u22121 , \u03c9f = 55s\u22121 ,\n\u03c9b = 1125s\u22121 , \u03b1 = 50s\u22121 and \u03b2 = 700s\u22121 .\n\nIn this model, departure of a motor from a site can take\nplace in two different ways: either by hopping to the next\n\nsite or by detachment from the track. Therefore, we first\nmodify the original definition of TH, which we presented\nin the introductory section, for our model of KIF1A under OBC. We interpret the attachments at the site i = 1\nand detachments at i = L as consequences solely of forward hoppings of the motors, rather than manifestations\nof Langmuir-like kinetics. The time interval in between\nthe exit of two successive motors from the site i = L is\nidentified as the corresponding TH.\nA few typical TH-distributions under OBC in our\nmodel of KIF1A traffic are plotted in fig.2 [26]. A higher\n\u03c9a leads to a higher average density of motors on the\ntrack which, in turn, reduces the most probable TH as\nlong as \u03b2 remains sufficiently high. This trend of variation is consistent with that of the average flux with \u03c9a\n[14, 15]. Moreover, a wider distribution at smaller \u03c9a\nindicates stronger fluctuations in the THs at a lower average density. In principle, these new theoretical predictions can be tested by carrying out in-vitro experiments with fluorescently-labelled KIF1A molecules using\nsingle-molecule imaging techniques. Systematic study of\nthe variation of the width of the TH distribution with\nthe control parameters of the experiment will provide\ndeep insight into the nature of \"noise\" in intracellular\ncytoskeletal motor transport.\n\nIII.\n\nTRAFFIC OF RNAP MOTORS ON DNA\nTRACKS\n\nPolymerization of a mRNA from the corresponding\nDNA template is carried out by a motor called RNA polymerase (RNAP) [27] and the process is called transcription. To our knowledge, all the models of transcription\nreported earlier [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]\ncapture only the stochastic mechano-chemistry of the individual RNAP motors. Cooperation and collisions between RNAP motors is known to have non-trivial effects\non the rate of transcription [39, 40, 41, 42]. Moreover,\nthe possibility of the formation of queues in RNAP traffic\nhas also been explored [43].\nThe interactions of RNAPs in transcriptional interference [44] is a well known phenomenon and it has also\nbeen modelled quantitatively [42]. However, instead of\nstudying interactions of RNAPs during the transcription\nof different genes, we have modelled the steric interactions of RNAPs which are simultaneously involved in the\ntranscription of the same gene.\nThe model is described schematically in fig.3. Each\nof the lattice sites corresponds to a single nucleotide on\nthe DNA template. Each successful addition of a nucleotide to the elongating RNA is accompanied by a forward stepping of the RNAP. A single mechano-chemical\ncycle of the RNAP during this elongation stage consists\nof several steps of which the major ones are as follows: (i)\nNucleoside triphosphate (NTP) binding to the active site\nof the RNAP when the active site is located at the tip of\nthe growing RNA transcript, (ii) NTP hydrolysis, (iii) re-\n\n\f4\nthe number density of the RNAPs. The coverage density\nis defined by \u03c1cov = N r/L which is the total fraction of\nthe nucleotides covered by all the RNAPs together.\n\n0.0025\ncoverage density= 0.4\ncoverage density= 0.5\n\nProbability\n\n0.002\n\nFIG. 3: A schematic representation of the mechano-chemical\ncycle of each RNAP in our model. The equispaced sites labelled by the integers ..., i\u22121, i, i+1, ... denote the nucleotides\non the template DNA track. No P Pi is bound to the RNAP\nin the state 1 whereas the pyrophosphate (P Pi )-bound state\nof the RNAP is labelled by the index 2. The allowed transitions denoted by arrows and the corresponding rate constants\nare also shown.\n\nlease of pyrophosphate (P Pi ), one of the products of hydrolysis, and (iv) accompanying forward stepping of the\nRNAP. Since P Pi -release is known to be the rate-limiting\nstep, we consider only two distinct chemical states \u03bc of\nthe RNAP; \u03bc = 1 refers to the state in which the RNAP\nis not bound to any P Pi whereas \u03bc = 2 corresponds to\nthe state with bound P Pi .\nThe processes corresponding to the rate constants \u03c912\nand \u03c921 are dominated by P Pi -release and its reverse\nf\nreaction. The symbol \u03c921\nis the rate of the successful adb\ndition of an NTP, catalyzed by the RNAP, whereas \u03c912\nis\nthat of the reverse reaction. The remaining four rate constants correspond to polymerization/depolymerization of\nthe RNA, by one monomer, unaided by the RNAP. Since\npremature detachment of a RNAP from its track is a very\nrare event during the elongation of the growing RNA, we\ndo not allow such processes in our model.\nThe values of some of the rate constants used in our\nb\n=\nnumerical studies are as follows: \u03c912 = 31.4 s\u22121 , \u03c912\nf\nf\n\u22121\n\u22125 \u22121\nb\n\u22121\n0.21 s , \u03c911 = 4.66 \u00d7 10 s , \u03c911 = 9.4 s , \u03c922 =\nb\n0.31 \u00d7 10\u22126 s\u22121 , \u03c922\n= 0.063 s\u22121 . The numerical values\nof the other rate constants are given in the captions of\nthe figures 4, 5 and 6.\nUnlike the cytoskeletal motors, a single RNAP is so\nlarge that it can simultaneously cover r successive nucleotides on the track. In our terminology, a site is occupied by a RNAP if it coincides with the leftmost of the r\nsites representing that RNAP while the next r \u2212 1 sites\non its right are said to be covered by the same RNAP. Irrespective of the actual numerical value of r, each RNAP\ncan move forward or backward by only one site in each\ntime step, if demanded by its own mechano-chemistry,\nprovided the target site is not already covered by any\nother RNAP. The total number of RNAPs on the DNA\ntemplate is denoted by the symbol N .

Recent progress in imaging\ntechniques has made it possible to monitor the synthesis\nof successive individual RNAs in a living cell [46]. Using\nthese techniques it has been demonstrated [47, 48, 49]\nthat synthesis of RNAs take place in \"bursts\" [50]. The\ntime series of the events correspoding to the TH distributions shown in figs.4, 5 and 6 do not account for such\n\"bursts\". But \"bursting\" is observed when our model\nis extended by incorporating the processes of \"swtiching\non\" and \"switching off\" of the gene [51].\n\n\u03c921f= 50\n\n0.0014\n0.0012\n\n0.0016\n\n0.001\n\n\u03c921= 1\n\u03c921= 10\n\u03c921= 50\n\n0.0014\n\n0.0008\n0.0006\n\n0.0012\n\n0.0004\n\n0.001\n\n0.0002\n0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\nTime headway (s)\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nProbability\n\nProbability\n\nTypical TH distributions of the RNAPs in this model\nunder PBC are plotted in figs.4, 5, 6 for biologically relevant sets of values of the parameters [45]; the corresponding results under OBC have been reported elsewhere [16].\nIn these parameter regimes, because of the \"chemical\ntransition\" between the states 1 and 2, the minimum\nTH is non-zero, i.e., P (\u03c4 ) = 0 for all \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c4min . The\nmagnitude of \u03c4min as well as the most probable TH are\npractically independent of the coverage density. Moreover, both \u03c4min and the most probable TH decrease with\nf\nincreasing \u03c921\n, (i.e., with increasing concentration of the\nmonomeric subunits of the growing mRNA). In contrast,\n\u03c4min and the most probable TH increase with increasing\n\u03c921 which tends to suppress forward movement of each\nRNAP along the main pathway (see fig.3). The trends\nof variation of the most probable TH with the model parameters are consistent with the corresponding trends of\nvariation of the average flux with the same parameters.\n\n0.0008\n0.0006\n0.0004\n0.0002\n\nFIG. 5: Distributions of the time-headways in the model of\nRNAP traffic under PBC.

Because of the PBC and because of the\nimpossibility of overtaking, the sequence of the labels remain unchanged during the time evolution of the system.\nTH is defined as the time interval between the departure\n\n0\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n3.0\nTime headway (s)\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\nFIG. 6: Distributions of the time-headways in the model of\nRNAP traffic under PBC.

Usually, many ribosomes move\nsimultaneously on a single mRNA strand while each synthesizes a separate copy of the same protein. Strictly\nspeaking, a ribosome is neither a particle nor a hard rod\n[53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]; its mechanical movement along the mRNA track is coupled to its internal\nmechanochemical processes which also drive the synthesis of the protein.\nVery recently, we have developed a model that not only\nincorporates the inter-ribosome steric interactions, but\nalso captures explicitly the essential steps in the intraribosome chemomechanical processes. This model for ribosome traffic is very similar to that for RNAP traffic\nexcept that (i) each lattice represents a codon (a triplet\nof nucleotides) and (ii) the mechano-chemical of a single ribosome (see fig.7) is quite different from that of a\nRNAP.\nEach ribosome consists of two subunits. The smaller\nsubunit binds to the mRNA track. But, the actual elongation of the protein takes place in the larger subunit by\nthe addition of the successive monomers, called amino\nacid. The operations of the two subunits are coordinated\nby an adaptor molecule called tRNA. It uses the anticodon at one of its ends to decode the genetic instructions stored in each codon of the mRNA which serves also\nas the template for synthesis of a protein. Each tRNA\ncarries an amino acid at its other end. Correct codonanticodon matching ensures that the correct amino acid,\nas dictated by the mRNA template, is used by the larger\nsubunit for elongating the protein by one monomer.\nThe main steps in the mechano-chemical cycle of a ribosome are the following:\n(i) arrival of the correct tRNA (rate constant \u03c9a ), (ii)\ngrowth of the protein by one monomer because of the formation of a covalent bond with the newly arrived amino\nacid (rate \u03c9g ), and (iii) forward movement of the ribosome by one codon which is associated with the hydrolysis of a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecule (rate\n\u03c9h2 ). The rate constants \u03c9h1 and k2 are associated\nwith two steps during which another GTP molecule is\nhydrolyzed. A more detailed description of the model\nis available in ref.[17]. The biologically relevant values\nof the parameters, which have been kept fixed throughout our studies of the TH distributions, are as follows:\n\u03c9p = 0.0028s\u22121, k2 = 2.4s\u22121 and \u03c9g = 2.5s\u22121 .\nUnder mean-field approximation, the master equations\nfor the probabilities P\u03bc (i) are given by [17]\n\u2202P1 (i)\n= \u03c9h2 P5 (i \u2212 1)Q(i-1|i \u2212 1 + r) + \u03c9pP2 (i) \u2212 \u03c9a P1 (i)\n\u2202t\n(13)\n\nFIG. 7: A schematic representation of the biochemical cycle\nof a single ribosome during the elongation stage of translation in our model [17].

Therefore, in this section, we shall consider exclusively only\ntraffic of RNAPs and ribosomes under PBC; the corresponding results under OBC are discussed in ref.[45] and\nref.[26].\nThe DH distribution in the TASEP with hard rods,\neach of length r, was calculated analytically by Shaw et\nal.[56]. Suppose, m denotes the DH. The DH-distribution\nP (m) in this model under PBC is given by [56]\n\n0.004\n\n0\n\nthe parameters of the model of ribosome traffic are very\nsimilar to those observed in the preceeding section in the\ncontext of RNAP traffic. Neither \u03c4min nor the most probable TH depend on the coverage density. But, both \u03c4min\nand most probable TH decrease with increasing \u03c9a which\nis a measure of the abundance of the amino acid subunits\nof the growing protein chain. A similar trend of variation of TH distribution is also observed with increasing\n\u03c9h which is a measure of the rate of \"fuel\" consumption\n(more precisely, rate of GTP hydrolysis).\nThe width of the TH distribution in ribosome traffic\ncan serve as a mesure of translational noise [19], just as\nthat in RNAP traffic has been considered in section III\nand in ref.[16] as a measure of transcriptional noise. A\ncomparison between the trend of variation of this noise\nwith our model parameters and the corresponding recent\nexperimental observations has been reported elsewhere\n[19].\n\n2.5\n\nTimeheadway (s)\n\nFIG. 10: TH distributions in the model of ribosome traffic\nunder PBC.

In the limit r = 1, \u03c1cov = \u03c1,\n\u03c1s = 1 and, hence, P (m) reduces to the limiting form\nP (m) = \u03c1(1 \u2212 \u03c1)m which is the well-known mean-field\nestimate of the DH distribution for TASEP [12, 13].\nIn fig.11 we have plotted the DH distributions in the\nmodels of RNAP traffic and ribosome traffic under PBC\nwhere r = 10 for both the models. Interestingly, for any\ngiven coverage density, the DH distributions in both these\nmodels follow equation (21) in spite of the differences\nin the mechano-chemical cycle of the individual motors.\nThus, the DH distributions in these models of molecular motor traffic are determined solely by the geometric\nparameters.\n\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we have modelled molecular motor transport on filamentary tracks from the perspective of physi-\n\n\f8\n0.14\n\nRNAP coverage density= 0.6\nRibosome coverage density= 0.6\nformula\nRNAP coverage density= 0.5\nRibosome coverage density= 0.5\nformula\nRNAP coverage density= 0.4\nRibosome coverage density= 0.4\nformula\n\n0.12\n\nProbability\n\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\n50\nDistance headway\n\n60\n\n70\n\nequilibrium systems of interacting self-driven particles.\nMoreover, many extensions of TASEP have been used\nearlier to capture various phenomena observed in vehicular traffic.
