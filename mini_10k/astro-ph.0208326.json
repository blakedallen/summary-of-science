Introduction\nDirect detection of supersymmetric WIMP\ndark matter in the coming decade appears possible. As shown in Fig. 1, experiments under construction should probe a large fraction of parameter space allowed by minimal supersymmetric\ntheory and experimental constraints [2\u20134]. Interestingly, if the sign of \u03bc, the Higgs mixing parameter in the superpotential, is positive, the WIMP\nmass must be < 500 GeV c\u22122 , and the WIMP\u22129\nnucleon cross section must be >\n\u223c 10 pb [3,4],\npossibly making the entire parameter space accessible to a ton-scale WIMP-detection experiment.\nCryoArray would be a 1-ton deployment of semiconductor cryogenic detectors, of a type similar\nto that in use in CDMS II [6]. This experiment\nwould be sensitive to a WIMP-nucleon cross section \u03c3 \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u221210 pb, corresponding to a signal\nof a few WIMP interactions per 100 kg years.\nThe detectors of CDMS or CryoArray measure\nphonons and charge carriers separately for each\ninteraction in order to allow rejection of the otherwise dominant electron-recoil background events.\nThe background discrimination of these detectors\nhas already been demonstrated to be so good [1,6]\nthat instrumenting a one-ton detector is fully justified. Below, we review in detail the expected\nperformance of CryoArray, and conclude with a\nshort discussion of the challenge to build such an\nexperiment at a reasonable cost.\n\nWIMP\u2212Nucleon Cross\u2212Section [pb]\n\narXiv:astro-ph/0208326v1 16 Aug 2002\n\nR.W.

Expected Backgrounds\nTable 1 lists photon, electron, and neutron\nbackground event rates in the energy range 15\u2013\n45 keV for actual exposures of CDMS I [1] and\nCDMS II at Stanford [6], and for projections for\nCDMS II at Soudan and for CryoArray. The\ngoals of CryoArray reflect a factor 20 improvement in backgrounds, and a factor 10 improvement in electron discrimination, over the goals for\nCDMS II. The low-energy threshold is at 15 keV\n(rather than 5 or 10 keV) to avoid the contributions of the cosmogenic activation peaks and\ntritium beta spectrum in Ge near 10 keV.\n\nThe first columns of the table show the radioactivity event rates and the total numbers of events\nexpected during the tabulated exposures. The\nother columns show how event-by-event discrimination can be used not only to reject most of\nthe background, but also to subtract part of the\nresidual background if the detector response is\nwell enough understood [7]. The results of this\nbackground subtraction include the effects of a\n5% systematic uncertainty in the detector discrimination. A muon veto provides the neutron\nrejection (see Section 2.3). However, the neutron\nsubtraction is performed based on the observed\npopulation of multiple-detector neutron events.\n\n\f3\n\n2.2. Electron Background\nThe beta electron background represents a\ngreater challenge. The current observed background rate for CDMS II at SUF is 80 mdru,\n4\u00d7 above the CDMS II Soudan goal of 20 mdru.\nSome of the current beta contamination may be\ndue to exposure of the detectors to a leaking\ncalibration source during testing. Use of such\nsources has been restricted. Moving to the deeper\nsite at Soudan will remove essentially all cosmogenically produced betas, potentially the dominant beta background. Furthermore, the discrimination performance of the new detectors (see\nFig. 2b) may well be sufficient even if CDMS II\ndoes not reach the absolute beta background goal.\nFor CryoArray, self-shielding will eliminate the\nbeta backgrounds from materials surrounding the\ndetector stacks. Nevertheless, improving the beta\nbackground by a further factor of 20 will require\nsensitive screening of the detectors and nearby\nmaterials. While screening to the required level\nof 0.02 counts keV\u22121 m\u22122 day\u22121 for betas with\nE > 50 keV appears achievable [10], cleaning the\nmaterials may require new techniques. Improving the electron discrimination to 99.5% appears\nachievable through improvements of the signalto-noise of the detectors.\n\n3\n\n10\nEvents\n\n2.1. Photon Background\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the original CDMS II and\nCryoArray goals [8] for rejection of photons have\nalready been exceeded. Based on the demonstrated rejection, the original photon-background\ngoal for CDMS II (15 events after subtraction)\nhas already been met, even without the expected\n3\u00d7 reduction in rate from increasing the experiment's depth. Furthermore, the rejection efficiencies in Table 1 are statistically limited lower\nlimits. and are probably overly conservative.\nBased on the demonstrated rejection, CryoArray's post-subtraction background goal for photons is achievable merely by reducing the raw\nphoton rate to 13 mdru, only 2\u00d7 lower than that\ncurrently achieved by IGEX [9] in HPGe detectors\nin the same energy range. This modest improvement is expected due to the increased detector\nself-shielding and multiple-scatter rejection from\nincreased mass and many detectors.\n\n(a)\n\n10\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n0 0.5 1 1.5 8 10 12 14 16\nIonization Yield\nRiseTime (\u03bcsec)\n\nFigure 2. Discrimination of background events\nin the energy range 10\u2013100 keV as demonstrated\nwith CDMS II calibration data [6] from sources of\nphotons (unfilled histograms) and neutrons (filled\nhistograms). (a) Discrimination of photons is\n> 99.97% efficient, limited by statistics. (b) Applying a cut based on phonon risetimes can remove > 97% of the low-ionization-yield events\n(mostly electrons) while keeping > 50% of the\nneutron events.\n\n2.3. Neutron Background\nThe low-energy (<10 MeV) neutrons from\n(\u03b1,n) and fission processes in the rock are trivially\nstopped by hydrogenous shielding. Such shielding reduces the low-energy neutron flux by \u223c10\u00d7\nper 10 cm of material, so 70 cm of such shielding\nshould make this neutron flux negligible.\nOther neutrons arise from muons interacting\ninside the experiment's shielding or in the cavern\nrock. The former can be tagged using a local active muon veto directly around the passive shielding. A muon veto efficiency of 80% is adequate at\nSoudan (2080 mwe) to ensure that these \"shield\"\nneutrons contribute negligibly to the CDMS II\nbackground. The demonstrated CDMS II muon\nveto efficiency of 99.95% would even be sufficient to limit this neutron background to a small\nenough rate at Soudan for CryoArray. A deeper\nsite such as Gran Sasso (at \u223c4 kmwe) would\nreduce the neutron flux by \u223c25\u00d7, making the\nmuon-veto requirement very modest.\nThe high-energy neutrons generated in the cavern rock by spallation processes of high-energy\n\n\f4\nmuons are difficult both to veto and to stop. With\nthe CDMS II polyethylene shielding sandwiching\nPb shielding, \u223c8 secondary neutrons from these\n\"punch-through\" neutrons should scatter in single detectors during the 2500 kg-day exposure,\nbased on extensive Monte Carlo studies [11,8].\nBecause this neutron flux for deep sites is approximately proportional to the muon flux [12],\nincreased depth is the easiest way to reduce this\nneutron background. Siting CryoArray at a depth\nof 4 kmwe would likely reduce this background\nsufficiently, while siting it at 7 kmwe should essentially remove this background. If the experiment were sited at <\n\u223c 2000 mwe (e.g. WIPP or\nSoudan), either a much thicker liquid-scintillator\nbuffer would be required around the detector in\norder to tag high-energy neutrons, or the cavern\nrock itself (or an outer heavy shield) would need\nto be instrumented with additional veto detectors\nin order to catch some part of the shower associated with the muon that generated the neutron.\n3. Conclusions\nCryoArray should work well enough to probe\n\u22129\nWIMP-nucleon cross sections \u03c3 <\n\u223c 10 pb once\nit is built. The most significant challenge at\nthis point is determining how to build it at a\nreasonable cost. For CDMS II, the 42 detectors are being built using university facilities and\ntechnicians under the close supervision of CDMS\nphysicists. Detectors are tested at least twice in\nbatches of \u2264 3 in university dilution refrigerators.\nThis time-consuming and physicist-intensive procedure is not practical for CryoArray's \u223c 500\u2013\n2000 detectors. An industrial approach is needed.\nIn order to \"out-source\" this effort, we will need\nto engineer and specify a stable and reliable highyield process. Since it is not feasible to test each\nindividual module prior to deployment in the array, the yield must be >\n\u223c 90%. This goal is ambitious; current detector yields are \u223c50%. We\nexpect to continue to make gains in understanding pathologies in the processing steps during the\nremaining CDMS II construction period, which is\nscheduled for completion at the end of 2003. In\n1\u20132 years we will have substantially more experience in fabricating and operating CDMS detec-\n\ntors. The knowledge gained will be essential for\nestablishing a realistic plan for building CryoArray and assessing its likely performance. This\nknowledge will likely point the way to additional\nlaboratory work to be carried out before a fullscale proposal is considered.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank our CDMS collaborators for innumerable useful discussions.
