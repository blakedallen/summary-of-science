It yields a CMB temperature T change at frequency \u03bd\ngiven by\n\u2206Tsz (n)\nex + 1\n= y(n) x x\n\u22124 ,\nT\ne \u22121\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the dimensionless Compton y-parameter is\ny(n) = \u03c3T\n\nZ\n\ndl\n\nne k(Te \u2212 T )\n,\nme c2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the integral is along the line of sight of n, and n = (l, b),\nb being the Galactic latitude and l the Galactic longitude. \u03c3T is\nthe cross section of the Thomson scattering and x = h\u03bd/kT . ne\nand Te are, respectively, the number density and temperature of hot\nelectrons.

The Xray based catalogues of clusters and galaxies, including the Northern ROSAT All Sky Galaxy Cluster Survey (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2000)\nand the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample (Ebeling et al. 1998) are\nfound to be cross-correlated with the WMAP maps at the 2-5 \u03c3\nlevel (Hern\u00e1ndez-Monteagudo and Rubi\u00f1o-Mart\u00edn 2004). The samples of groups and clusters identified from the APM galaxy survey (Maddox et al. 1990), and 2MASS (Jarrett et al. 2000) show\ncross correlation with W band data of the WMAP (Myers et al.\n2004).The WMAP-2MASS correlation is also found by comparing it with model expectation (Afshordi et al. 2004). Using a semianalytic model of the Intra-Cluster Medium, SZ signal was detected\nfrom 116 low redshift X-ray clusters at \u223c 8\u03c3 level (Afshordi et al.\n2005).\nOn the other hand, the WMAP data are found to be Gaussian,\nespecially no significant non-Gaussian signals have been detected\non scales of clusters (e.g. Komatsu et al. 2003). Therefore, a problem is whether the positive results of detecting the SZ effect with\nWMAP-galaxy cross-correlation is consistent with the negative re-\n\n\f2\n\nCao, Chu & Fang\n\nsults of detecting non-Gaussian features of the WMAP data alone?\nIn this paper, we try to reconcile the two results. That is, we want\nto show that 1.) the WMAP maps contain SZ-effect-induced nonGaussianity; 2.) this non-Gaussian signal cannot be seen with the\nWMAP maps alone.\nWe will study the non-Gaussianity induced by the SZ effect\nof the galaxy sample listed in the 2MASS extended source catalog.\nFirst, the SZ effects of 2MASS galaxies have been detected at about\n3 \u03c3 level with the cross-correlation between the maps of WMAP\nand 2MASS (Myers et al. 2004; Afshordi et al. 2004). Second,\nthe non-Gaussian features of the 2MASS samples have been extensively analyzed (Guo et al. 2004). It would be helpful to search for\nthe WMAP's non-Gaussianity induced by the SZ effect of 2MASS\ngalaxies.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we present the data\nused for the cross correlation analysis. \u00a73 analyzes the SZ effects of\nthe DWT clusters, which are identified from the 2MASS galaxies\nwith the discrete wavelet transfer (DWT) decomposition. The nonGaussianity of WMAP induced by the SZ effect of the 2MASS\nDWT clusters is analyzed in \u00a74. The discussion and conclusion are\ngiven in \u00a75. Some math stuffs with the DWT algorithm are given in\nAppendix.\n\n2 SAMPLES AND ITS DWT DESCRIPTION\n\nform sample, we use the following parameters: use src = 1 and\ndup src = 0 1 .\nTo select the range of Ks , we use the standard log N \u2212 log S\ntest to examine the completeness of the sample. The number counts\ncan be approximated by a power-law (Afshordi et al. 2004) as\ndN\n\u221d 10 \u03ba m .\ndm\n\n(3)\n\nThe XSC sources with |b| > 30\u25e6 and 12 < Ks < 13.7 are believed\nto be galaxies with 99% reliability (McIntosh et al. 2003). For this\nsample, the index \u03ba is found to be 0.641\u00b10.006. If considering this\n\u03ba to be the standard, the completeness of a sample can be estimated\nby the deviation of (dN/dm)sample from the standard, i.e.\nC(m) =\n\n(dN/dm)standard\n,\n(dN/dm)sample\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the standard sample is taken to 12 < Ks < 13.7 and\n|b| > 30\u25e6 . It has been shown by Guo et al. (2004) that the completeness C(m) is equal to 1 for sample of |b| > 10\u25e6 in the range\n11 < Ks < 13.7. The factor C(m) is obviously larger than 1 for\nsample of |b| > 30\u25e6 when Ks < 10.0. This indicates the catalog to be contaminated towards the bright end. On the other hand,\nC(m) drops below 0.9 when Ks > 14.0. Thus we use a cut of\n10.0 < Ks < 14.0 to ensure our sample to be complete greater\nthan 90%. This sample contains 987,125 galaxies with median redshift z \u223c 0.1. It gives a 2-D number density field of galaxies,\n\u03c1g (n).\n\n2.1 Data of CMB temperature fluctuations\n\n2.3 DWT variables of maps\n\nWe use the foreground cleaned WMAP maps, \u2206T (n), of W and\nQ bands (Bennett et al. 2003a). The contamination of the galactic foreground is reduced by mask Kp2 (Bennett et al. 2003b).\nThese maps were used for producing the WMAP first-year power\nspectrum of CMB temperature fluctuations. The foreground signal,\nconsisting of synchrotron, free-free, and dust emission have been\nremoved.\nThe frequency of Q band is 40.7 GHz, and the SZ effect is\n(\u2206Tsz /T )Q = \u22121.91y, while the frequency of W band is 93.6\nGHz, we have (\u2206Tsz /T )W = \u22121.56y. That is, at these two frequencies, the SZ signals \u2206Tsz is less than 0. Therefore, the SZ signals would be survived during the removal of foreground emission\nsources.\n\nTo analyze the cross correlation and non-Gaussian signals, we will\nuse the variable given by the discrete wavelet analysis (DWT) decomposition. That is, statistical properties are measured by DWT\nmode-mode correlation, and non-Gaussianity is detected by high\norder statistics of the DWT variables. Since the DWT mode is localized in phase (position and scale) space, and has regular shape,\nit can also be used for 1.) handle the bad pixels in maps; 2.) identify\nclusters from galaxy map.\nSince the SZ effect is on small scales, one can subject the\nCMB temperature maps to an equal-area projection by the Lambert azimuthal algorithm:\nx1\nx2\n\n2.2 2MASS-XSC galaxies\nWe use the 2MASS extended source catalog (XSC, Jarrett et\nal. 2000), which covers almost the entire sky at wavelength between 1 and 2 \u03bcm. The condition of selecting galaxies is taken\nto be K m k20fe, which measures the magnitude inside a elliptical isophote with surface brightness of 20 mag arcsec\u22122 in Ks band. There are approximately 1.6 million extended objects with\nKs < 14.3. Most of the XSC sources at |b| > 20\u25e6 are galaxies\n(> 98%). The contamination mainly is from stars. The reliability\nof separating stars from extended sources is 95% at |b| > 10\u25e6 ,\nbut drops rapidly to < 65% at |b| > 5\u25e6 . To avoid the contaminant of stars, we use a latitude cut of |b| > 10\u25e6 . We also removed\na small number of bright (Ks < 9) sources by the parameters of\nthe XSC confusion flag (cc flag) and visual verification score for\nsource (vc). They are identified as non-extended sources including\nartifacts. Moreover, to eliminate duplicate sources and have a uni-\n\n=\n=\n\nR\nR\n\np\n\n2 \u2212 2| sin b| cos l,\n\n(5)\n\np\n\n2 \u2212 2| sin b| sin l,\n\nwhere R is a relative scale factor,b is the Galactic latitude and l is\nthe Galactic longitude. This hemisphere scheme projects the whole\nsky into two circular plane, northern and southern sky. 2MASS\ngalaxies are also described by this format. We select a square with\n123\u25e6 .88 \u00d7 123\u25e6 .88 in the central part of each circular plane. We\nhave two fields of 123\u25e6 .88 \u00d7 123\u25e6 .88 in northern and southern\nsky. Both the WMAP map and 2MASS galaxy distribution are fully\noverlapped with each other. We will use coordinate x = (x1 , x2 )\nto replace n = (l, b) below. The 2-D maps of \u2206T (n) and \u03c1g (n)\nwill be written as \u2206T (x) and \u03c1g (x).\nThe DWT variables are defined as\n\u2206Tj,l\n\n1\n\n=\n\nR\n\n1\n\u03c6j,l (x)dx\n\nZ\n\n\u2206T (x)\u03c6j,l (x)dx,\n\n(6)\n\nThe notations of the 2MASS parameters used in this paragraph are from the list shown in the 2MASS Web site\nhttp://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/doc.\n\n\fCross correlation of WMAP and 2MASS\n\u03c1j,l\n\n=\n\nR\n\nand\n\u01eb\u0303Tj,l\n\u01eb\u0303gj,l\n\n1\n\u03c6j,l (x)dx\n\nZ\n\n3\n\n\u03c1g (x)\u03c6j,l (x)dx,\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u2206T (x)\u03c8j,l (x)dx,\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1g (x)\u03c8j,l (x)dx,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c6j,l (x) and \u03c8j,l (x) are, respectively, the scaling function and wavelet. For our 2-D samples, the DWT variables\n\u2206Tj,l and \u03c1j,l describe, respectively, the mean temperature and\nthe mean number density of galaxies in the cell (j, l), which\nhas size 123\u25e6 .88/2j1 \u00d7 123\u25e6 .88/2j2 and at position around\n[l1 (123\u25e6 .88)/2j1 , l2 (123\u25e6 .88)/2j1 ], where j1 and j2 can be any\nintegral, and l1 = 0, ...2j1 \u22121 , l2 = 0, ...2j2 \u22121 . Thus, the DWT\nindex j corresponds to an angular scale of 123\u25e6 .88/2j . The angular distance between modes l and l\u2032 at scale j is given by\n\u03b8 = 123.88\u25e6 |l \u2212 l\u2032 |/2j . The wavelet variables (WFCs) \u01eb\u0303Tj,l and \u01eb\u0303gj,l\ndescribe, respectively, the fluctuations of temperature and galaxy\ndensity on scale j and position l. Some details of the algorithm\nwith the DWT is given in Appendix A.\n\u2032\u2032\nThe 2MASS XSC galaxies are resolved to 10 . Our analysis\nof the 2MASS sample can reach to angular scale of about 0.01 degree. However, on scales less than \u03b8 = 123\u25e6 .88/29 = 0\u25e6 .24, the\nWMAP data are dominated by noise. In calculating the WMAP2MASS cross correlation or WMAP's auto-correlation, we will use\nonly scales of j = 8.\nSince the DWT variable \u2206Tj,l is localized, it can be used to\nhandle the foreground masks. A standard technique to treat contaminated pixels is zero-padding (Pando & Fang 1998). That is,\n1.) put zero data at the masked pixels, and 2.) off-count the DWT\nmodes (j, l) located at the masked pixels. We test the zero padding\nby simulation samples generated with code HEALPix2 . The results\nshow the Kp2 masked samples with zero padding yield the same\nstatistical properties as the original simulated samples, at least, up\nto the 4th order.\nWe should emphasize that the Lambert projection will violate the rotational invariance on the spherical surface. We will not\nuse the rotational invariance in our analysis. Moreover, we show in\nAppendix B that the Lambert projection does not cause false nonGaussian features. That is, if the original map is free from nonGaussian correlations, the projected map is also free from these\ncorrelations. The Lambert projection is legitimate for our DWT\nanalysis.\n\n3 THE SZ EFFECT OF 2MASS CLUSTERS\n\nFigure 1. Cross correlation hT (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) [eq.(8)] between the WMAP maps\nof W (top) and Q (bottom) bands and top 500 2MASS DWT clusters on\nscale j = 8. The angular scale of |l \u2212 l\u2032 | is |l \u2212 l\u2032 |123.88/28 degree.\n\nmethod if the mean size of the friend-of-friend identified clusters is\nthe same as that of DWT clusters.\nThe scale of DWT variables is well defined, and therefore, it\nis parameter-free. On the other hand, the friend-of-friend algorithm\nneeds the so-called link parameter. These parameters may introduce\nuncertainty in the correlation analysis. Moreover, The clusters identified by the friend-of-friend method usually have very irregular\nshapes (Jing & Fang 1994), it is inconvenient to estimate the statistical significance of the cross correlation between CMB maps and\ngalaxy catalog. On the other hand, the variables \u03c1j,l and \u2206Tj,l are\nin the same spatial cell of DWT mode, the statistical significance\nwith \u03c1j,l and \u2206Tj,l is unambiguous. The DWT scaling functions\nare orthogonal from each other, different DWT clusters consist of\ndifferent galaxies. This is also useful for statistical analysis.\nWe identified, in this paper, the DWT clusters on j = 8, which\ncorresponds to angular scale 123\u25e6 .88/28 \u2243 0\u25e6 .5, or length scale\n\u2243 1.8 h\u22121 Mpc at the median redshift of the sample, which is the\nscale of clusters of galaxies. We selected 500 cells with top \u03c1j,l ,\nwhich are the peaks with 6.4\u03c3 and higher, \u03c3 being the variance of\nthe fluctuations of the number density field of galaxies. The number\nof galaxies in the top 500 cells is from about 20 to 60. Although the\n500 cells is identified with 2-D sample, they most likely contain\nprojected clusters or groups.\n\n3.1 DWT clusters of 2MASS galaxies\nThe SZ effect is sensitive to hot gas clouds. If the mass density\nand temperature of gas are proportional to the number density of\ngalaxies, one can identify hot gas clouds on scale j by modes (j, l)\nwith the high \u03c1j,l . These modes (j, l) are called DWT clusters on\nscale j. The general method of identifying DWT clusters with \u03c1j,l\nhave been studied with simulation and real samples (Xu et al. 1999,\n2000). It showed that the clusters identified by top \u03c1j,l statistically are the same as the clusters identified by the friend-of-friend\n\n2\n\nThe Healpix homepage: http://www.eso.org/science/healpix\n\n3.2 The contamination of SZ effect\nWe perform the cross-correlation between the WMAP data and the\n2MASS DWT clusters by\n\u2206T (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) = hCj,l \u2206Tj,l\u2032 i,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the variable Cj,l is taken to be 1 for mode (j, l) corresponding to a DWT cluster on scale j = 8, and Cj,l = 0, other modes.\nThe average h...i overs all possible |l \u2212l\u2032 | of the sample. Therefore,\n\u2206T (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) is an average CMB temperature fluctuations with a\ndistance |l \u2212 l\u2032 | from DWT clusters on scale j = 8.\n\n\f4\n\nCao, Chu & Fang\n\nFigure 1 presents the cross correlation \u2206T (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) of W and\nQ band maps with the top 500 2MASS DWT clusters. For each\nDWT cluster, one can have a correlation \u2206T (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |). The solid\nline and error bar in each panel of Fig. 1 are, respectively, given\nby the average and 1-\u03c3 variance of \u2206T (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) of the considered 500 top DWT clusters. Figure 1 shows anti-correlation of the\nDWT clusters with \u2206T at |l \u2212 l\u2032 | = 0 with temperature decrease\n\u2206Tsz \u2261 \u2206T (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) \u2212 h\u2206T i \u2243 \u221215 \u00b1 10 \u03bcK, or the Compton y-parameter to be \u2243 (3.7 \u00b1 2.4) \u00d7 10\u22126 . This result is about\nthe same as that given by 500 2MASS galaxy clusters selected by\nfriends-of-friends algorithm (Myers et al. 2004). The frequencydependence |(\u2206Tsz /T )Q | = 1.91y > |(\u2206Tsz /T )W | = 1.56y\ndidn't shown in Figure 1. It is probably because the difference between (\u2206Tsz /T )Q and (\u2206Tsz /T )W is much less than the errors\nof Figure 1.\nWe also can see from Figure 1 that for Q band also have a\nweak anti-correlation at |l \u2212 l\u2032 | = 1 with the level of \u2206Tsz \u2243\n\u221210 \u00b1 7 \u03bc K. This result indicates that the distribution of hot gas\nprobably is not simply proportional to the number density of optical and infrared galaxies, but is more spread than the distribution of\ngalaxies. Recently, cosmological hydrodynamic simulation shows\nindeed that the hottest gas generally distributes more spread than\ngalaxies (He et al. 2005). Therefore, it would be reasonable to consider that hot gas is spread in the range of |l \u2212 l\u2032 | \u2264 1 around a\nDWT clusters.\nWe did not found significant anti-correlation with the DWT\nclusters more than top 500, or on scales larger than j = 8. Therefore, the 500 top DWT clusters give an estimation of the contamination on the WMAP maps induced by the SZ effect of 2MASS\ngalaxies. On scale of j = 8, the map has divided into 2 \u00d7 2562\ncells. The 500 j = 8 DWT clusters do not overlapped from each\nother, and therefore, there are about 500/(2 \u00d7 2562 ) = 0.4% area\nof the temperature maps of the WMAP to be contaminated by the\n2MASS SZ effects with the order of \u2206Tsz \u2243 \u221215 \u00b1 10 \u03bc K. Considering the Q band signal at |l \u2212 l\u2032 | = 1, the contaminated area\nwould be about 1%.\n3.3 Mock samples of SZ contaminated CMB maps\nIf the anti-correlation shown in Fig. 1 is due to the SZ effect of\n2MASS clusters, we can mimic a SZ-effect-contaminated CMB\nmap by the following mock sample\n\u2206T (x) = \u2206Tcmb (x) + \u2206Tsz (x) + \u2206Tsecond (x),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u2206Tcmb (n) is the primeval temperature fluctuations, and\n\u2206Tsecond (n) is due to secondary effects other than the SZ effect,\nsuch as the ISW effect and microwave point sources. The term\n\u2206Tsz (x) of eq.(9) is given by eqs.(1) and (2). We consider only\nthe SZ effects caused by hot electron in 2MASS galaxies, which\nare in a small redshift bin around z \u2243 0.1, it is described by surface density \u03c1g (x). Therefore, we rewrite the Compton parameter\ncol\nas y \u2243 (\u03c3T /me c2 )ncol\ne (n)Te (n), where ne (n) is the column\ndensity of electrons, and Te (n) is the density-weighted mean of\ntemperature of electrons in the redshift range of 2MASS. Generally Te \u226b Tcmb . Therefore, the thermal SZ effect can be estimated\nas \u2206Tsz (x) \u221d ncol\ne (x)T (x).\nIf galaxies trace hot baryon gas, we have approximately\nncol\ne (x) \u221d \u03c1g (x). The relation between temperature T and mass\ndensity \u03c1g actually is complicated, because the cosmic baryon gas\nis multiple phased (e.g. He et al. 2004). For a given dark matter\n(or baryon matter) mass density, the PDF (probability distribution\nfunction) of the temperature of baryon gas covers a large range\n\nFigure 2. Cross correlation hT (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)i [eq.(8)] between mock sample A\nand top 500 2MASS DWT clusters on scale j = 8. The angular scale of\n|l \u2212 l\u2032 | is |l \u2212 l\u2032 |123.88/28 degree.\n\nfrom 104 to 106\u22127 K. Nevertheless, the relation between the mean\ntemperature and mass density of the gas can be approximated as\na polytropic relation Te \u221d \u03c1g\u03b1\u22121 , where \u03b1 is about 1.5 (He et al.\n2004). Thus, we have \u2206Tsz (x) \u221d \u03c1\u03b1\ng (x). Therefore, to mimic the\nthermal SZ effect, it would be reasonable to assume\n\u2206Tsz (x) = \u2212f\n\nh(\u01eb\u0303Tj,l )2 i1/2 \u03b1\n\u03c1 (x),\n2 1/2 g\nh(\u01eb\u0303g\u03b1\nj,l ) i\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u01eb\u0303Tj,l and \u01eb\u0303g\u03b1\nj,l are, respectively, the wavelet variables (WFCs)\nof \u2206Tcmb (x) and \u03c1\u03b1\ng (x) [eq.(7)]. Subjecting eq.(10) to a wavelet\ntransform [eq.(7)], and considering \u2206T \u226b \u2206Tsz , \u2206Tsecond , we\nhave\n2 1/2\n/h(\u01eb\u0303Tj,l )2 i1/2 .\nf = h(\u01eb\u0303g\u03b1\nj,l ) i\n\n(11)\n\n2 1/2\nBecause h(\u01eb\u0303Tj,l )2 i1/2 and h(\u01eb\u0303g\u03b1\nare, respectively, the powj,l ) i\ners of the fields of CMB temperature fluctuations and SZ effect on\nscale j (Fang & Feng 2000), the parameter f is the ratio between\nthe two powers on scale j.\nThus, with eq.(9) we can construct mock sample of SZ-effectcontaminated CMB maps by the following steps. First, the term\n\u2206Tcmb (x) in eq.(9) is produced by the HEALPix simulation. Second, the term \u2206Tsz (x) is given by eq.(10), in which \u03c1(x) is taken\nto be the value given by the 2MASS map if the position x is within\nthe cells of the top 500 clusters, otherwise, \u03c1g (x) is taken to be\nequal to zero. We ignore the term \u2206Tsecond (x). Finally, we estimate f by doing cross correlation between the mock sample eq.(9)\nand 2MASS DWT clusters. Figure 2 plots \u2206T (|l\u2212l\u2032 |) vs. |l\u2212l\u2032 | for\nf = 0.01 0.1 and 0.2. The best fitting to the observed SZ temperature change \u2206Tsz \u2243 \u221215\u00b110 \u03bcK is given by f \u2243 0.1, which is ratio of the powers of SZ effect to the CMB fluctuations. This result is\nconsistent with the estimation given by semi-analytical model and\nsimulation (e.g. Cooray et al. 2004). This sample is called Mock A.\nUnlike Figure 1, Figure 2 does not show the tail of \u2206T (|l\u2212l\u2032 |)\nat |l \u2212 l\u2032 | \u2243 1. This is because we assume ne (x) \u221d \u03c1g (x), i.e. no\nhot gas locates out side of a DWT cluster. If we assume that hot\nelectron ne (x) can exist not only at the cells of DWT clusters, but\n\n\fCross correlation of WMAP and 2MASS\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Cross correlation hT (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)i [eq.(8)] between mock sample B\nand top 500 2MASS DWT clusters on scale j = 8. The angular scale of\n|l \u2212 l\u2032 | is |l \u2212 l\u2032 |123.88/28 degree.\n\nFigure 4. Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |), vs |l \u2212 l\u2032 | at j = (j, j) = (8, 8) for CMB simulation samples. The error bars are the range of 90% of 100 samples.\n\nalso in their nearby cells, we have sample of Mock B. The cross\ncorrelation between mock sample B and 2MASS DWT clusters are\nshown in Fig.3, which does show a tail of \u2206T (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |). We see that\nthe sample of f = 0.1 is also basically the same as observation.\nThe term \u2206Tsecond (x) of eq.(9) comes from the ISW and microwave point sources. The ISW effect is mainly from potential\nwith linear evolution. The ISW effect given by nonlinear evolution\nis very small (Seljak 1996; Tuluie et al. 1996). One can ignore this\neffect if we focus on non-Gaussian behavior. If a microwave point\nsource is from the 2MASS galaxies, their contributions to the SZ effect have already been included in the WMAP-2MASS cross correlation. If the microwave sources are not from the 2MASS galaxies,\nthey generally are uncorrelated with 2MASS distribution \u03c1g (x),\nand therefore, the SZ signal of the 2MASS-WMAP cross correlation would not be hurt by this sources.\n\nCj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) =\n\n4 NON-GAUSSIANITY INDUCED BY SZ EFFECT OF\n2MASS GALAXIES\n4.1 Non-Gaussianity detectors\nUsing the mock samples, we try to estimate which non-Gaussian\nfeatures are detectable with the WMAP samples. Effective detectors of non-Gaussianity are given by high order auto-correlations\nand cross-correlations of wavelet variables (WFCs) \u2206Tcmb (x) and\n\u03c1\u03b1\ng (x) (e.g. Pando et al. 1998, 2002; Guo et al. 2004; McEwen et\nal. 2004; Cruz et al. 2005). The normalized high order correlation\nof wavelet variables is defined as\nCjp,q (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) \u2261\n\nh(\u00c3j,l )p (B\u0303j,l\u2032 )q i\n\nh(\u00c3j,l )p ih(B\u0303j,l\u2032 )q i\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u00c3j,l and B\u0303j,l\u2032 can be \u01eb\u0303Tj,l or \u01eb\u0303gj,l . Because h\u01eb\u0303Tj,l i = h\u01eb\u0303gj,l i = 0,\nthe number p and q of eq.(12) should be even integer. When \u00c3j,l =\nB\u0303j,l , Cj2,2 (0) is the kurtosis of the field considered. Therefore for\na Gaussian field, we have\n\n\u001a\n\n3\n1\n\n|l \u2212 l\u2032 | = 0\n|l \u2212 l\u2032 | > 0\n\n(13)\n\nIn Figure 4, we plots Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) for CMB map \u2206Tcmb (x)\nproduced by the HEALPix simulation. As expected, this sample is\nGaussian.\nOn the other hand, the sample of 2MASS-XSC galaxies\nis non-Gaussian (Guo et al. 2004). Figure 5 plots the |l \u2212 l\u2032 |dependence of Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) for the 2MASS galaxies. We see that\nCj2,2 (0) is significantly larger than 3, while at all other points,\ni.e. |l \u2212 l\u2032 | =\n6 0, we have Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) = 1. That is, the nonGaussianity of 2MASS samples measured by Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) is localized. It depends only on the density distribution of galaxies in\nthe area considered, regardless galaxies in other places. With this\nfeature, one can say that the mock sample eq.(10) contains all the\n2MASS non-Gaussian features if they are measured by detectors\neq.(12). Of course, if consider the contribution of hot electron in\nnearby areas of DWT clusters, like in mock sample B, the detector\nCj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) would also show a tail till to about |l \u2212 l\u2032 | = 1. However, the non-Gaussianity measured by Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |) still is localized in the sense that the hot electron distribution is determined by\nthe position of the DWT clusters considered, regardless galaxies in\nother area.\n\n4.2 Signature of non-Gaussianity induced by SZ effect\nTo detect the WMAP non-Gaussianity given by SZ contamination\nof 2MASS galaxies, we use the 4th order cross-correlation between\nthe CMB maps and 2MASS galaxy distribution defined as\nCj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cross =\n\nh(\u01eb\u0303Tj,l )2 (\u01eb\u0303gj,l\u2032 )2 i\n\nh(\u01eb\u0303Tj,l )2 ih(\u01eb\u0303gj,l\u2032 )2 i\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\nUsing eqs.(9) and (10), we have\nCj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cross =\n\n(15)\n\n\f6\n\nCao, Chu & Fang\n\nFigure 5. Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |), vs |l \u2212 l\u2032 | at j = (j, j) = (8, 8) for 2MASS\ngalaxy samples of north (solid) and south (dashed).\nT\n\nh(\u01eb\u0303j,lcmb )2 (\u01eb\u0303gj,l\u2032 )2 i\nh(\u01eb\u0303Tj,l )2 ih(\u01eb\u0303gj,l\u2032 )2 i\n\n+ f2\n\n2 g\n2\nh(\u01eb\u0303g\u03b1\nj,l ) (\u01eb\u0303j,l\u2032 ) i\n\ng\n2\n2\nh(\u01eb\u0303g\u03b1\nj,l ) ih(\u01eb\u0303j,l\u2032 ) i\n\nSince there is no correlation between primeval CMB map and\ngalaxies, we have h(\u01eb\u0303Tj,lcmb )2 (\u01eb\u0303gj,l\u2032 )2 i = h(\u01eb\u0303Tj,lcmb )2 ih(\u01eb\u0303gj,l\u2032 )2 i.\nTherefore, the first term on the right hand side of eq.(15) is always\n\u223c 1. It is irrelevant to the non-Gaussian features. The non-Gaussian\nsignal fully comes from the second term on the right hand side of\neq.(15).\nIf the galaxy field is Gaussian, we have\nCj2,2 (|l\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212 l |)cross \u2243\n\n\u001a\n\n1 + 3f 2 \u2243 1.03\n1\n\n|l \u2212 l\u2032 | = 0\n|l \u2212 l\u2032 | > 0\n\n(16)\n\nwhere we used f = 0.1. Thus, we may expect that the nonGaussian kurtosis of 2MASS galaxies shown in Figure 5 will induce Cj2,2 (0)cross > 1.03.\nThe cross-correlation Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cross for the WMAP map\nand 500 2MASS DWT clusters is shown in Fig. 6. In the top panel\nof Fig.6, the solid and dotted line are for W and Q band respectively. The black points and error bars are the mean and 90% range\nof 100 simulation samples without SZ term. Therefore, Fig. 6 do\nshow Cj2,2 (0)cross > 1.03. The middle and bottom panels of Fig. 6\nare, respectively, the Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cross vs. |l \u2212 l\u2032 | for mock sample A and B with f = 0.1. The error bars are the 90% range of 100\nmock samples. From Fig. 6, one can conclude that 1.) There are\npositive signals of the 4th cross correlation between the wavelet\nvariables of WMAP data and 2MASS clusters; 2.) The 4th crosscorrelation is consistent with the estimation of mock samples A and\nB, and therefore, this non-Gaussian feature probably is from the SZ\neffect of 2MASS galaxies.\n4.3 Cross-correlation vs. auto-correlation\nThe last problem we should study is whether the SZ-effectcaused non-Gaussianity can also be seen with the high order autocorrelations of WMAP maps.This point can be analyzed with the\n4th order detector defined as\n\nFigure 6. Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cross between a.)(top) WMAP map and top 500\n2MASS DWT clusters on scale j = 8, in which solid and dotted line are for\nW and Q band respectively, and the black points and error bars are the mean\nand 90% range of 100 simulation samples without SZ term; b.)(middle)\nthe mock sample A and top 500 2MASS DWT clusters on scale j = 8;\nc.)(bottom) the mock sample B and top 500 2MASS DWT clusters on scale\nj = 8. The error bars of b.) and c.) are the 90% range of 100 mock samples\n\nCj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cmb =\n\nh(\u01eb\u0303Tj,l )2 (\u01eb\u0303Tj,l\u2032 )2 i\n.\nh(\u01eb\u0303Tj,l )2 ih(\u01eb\u0303Tj,l\u2032 )2 i\n\n(17)\n\nThis detector actually is similar to Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cross [eq.(14)], but\ninstead of \u01eb\u0303gj,l by \u01eb\u0303Tj,l .\nUsing eqs.(9) and (10), we have\nCj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cmb =\n\n(18)\n\nterms irrelevant to nongaussianity\n2 g\u03b1 2\nh(\u01eb\u0303g\u03b1\nj,l ) (\u01eb\u0303j,l\u2032 ) i\n+f 4 g\u03b1 2\n.\nh(\u01eb\u0303j,l ) ih(\u01eb\u0303g\u03b1\n)2 i\nj,l\u2032\n\nComparing eq.(18) with eq.(15), it is clear that the non-Gaussian\nterm in eq.(15) is proportional to f 2 , while in eq.(18) to f 4 . Therefore, the SZ signal in Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cmb is weaker than that in\nCj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cross by a factor f 2 , which can be as small as \u2243 10\u22122\nif considering mock samples A and B. Thus, it is not surprised that\nthis non-Gaussianity is undetectable with current CMB maps like\nWMAP.\nFigure 7 gives Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cmb vs. |l \u2212 l\u2032 | for W and Q\nbands of WMAP data, and for mock samples A and B. It shows no\nsignificant non-Gaussianity. Therefore, the detector of cross correlation Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cross is effective to pick up the SZ-effectinduced non-Gaussianity, while the detector of auto-correlation\nCj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cmb is not sensitive to that non-Gaussinaity. This result is not limited with the 4th order detectors, but it should be a\ncommon feature of high order detectors eq.(12). To replace (\u01eb\u0303gj,l )2\nwith (\u01eb\u0303Tj,l )2 will lead to a factor f 2 in the non-Gaussian term, and\ntherefore, the cross-correlation detectors generally are more sensitive to the SZ-effect induced non-Gaussianity than auto-correlation\nof CMB maps.\n\n\fCross correlation of WMAP and 2MASS\n\n7\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the use of the HEALPix software and analysis\npackage for producing simulation maps of the CMB.Liang Cao\nthanks Yi-Cheng Guo for his help.This work is in partial supported\nby the NSF AST-0507340.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFigure 7.

The error\nbars are the 90% range of 100 simulation samples.\n\n5 CONCLUSION\nWith the DWT clusters of 2MASS sample, we confirmed the previous results of the SZ effect of 2MASS galaxies on the WMAP\ndata (Myers et al. 2004; Afshordi et al. 2004). For the foreground\ncleaned WMAP maps of W and Q bands, there are about 0.4-1%\narea of the maps is contaminated by the SZ effect of 2MASS DWT\nclusters with the Compton parameter y = (3.7 \u00b1 2.4) \u00d7 10\u22126 .\nWith mock samples of the 2MASS SZ effect, we show that the nonGaussianity of the 2MASS galaxies is imprinted on WMAP maps.\nThis non-Gaussianity can be seen with the 4th order cross correlation between the wavelet variables of the maps of the WMAP data\nand 2MASS clusters. The intensity of the 4th order non-Gaussian\nfeatures is consistent with the estimation given by the mock samples of the SZ effect of 2MASS galaxies. We show also that this\nnon-Gaussianity can not be seen by the 4th and higher order autocorrelation of the WMAP maps.\nThe space-scale decomposition of the DWT is powerful tool\nfor studying the SZ effect. The DWT variable can be applied to find\nclusters from galaxy samples, to identify the SZ effect of the DWT\nclusters, to detect the non-Gaussianity with high order correlation.\nWith this method, all statistics are based on the same set of the\nDWT variables with well defined scale, position and shape of the\nmodes, the relation between the SZ effect contamination and nonGaussianity of the CMB maps can be measured without ambiguous\nparameters.\nWe also found, because the ratio between powers of SZ maps\nto the CMB maps generally is much less than 1, the cross correlation between the WMAP map and galaxy distribution would\nbe more effective to pick up non-Gaussianity than auto-correlation\nof the WMAP map. Due to the limitation of the resolution of\nWMAP data, we studied only the SZ effect on scale j = 8,\nor \u2243 0\u25e6 .5. Once higher resolution map is available, the ratio Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cmb /Cj2,2 (|l \u2212 l\u2032 |)cross would be able to provide\nmore information of the ratio of the powers of SZ effect and CMB\nfluctuations on different scales.\n\nAfshordi N., Loh Y.-S.,& Strauss M.

We divide the space into 2j segments labelled by l =\n0, 1, ...2j \u2212 1 each of size L/2j . The index j is a positive integer\nand gives the length scale L/2j . The larger the j is, the smaller the\nlength scale. Any reference to a property as a function of scale j\nbelow must be interpreted as the property at length scale L/2j . The\nindex l represents position and it corresponds to the spatial range\nlL/2j < x < (l + 1)L/2j . Hence, the space L is decomposed into\ncells (j, l).\nThe discrete wavelet is constructed such that each cell (j, l)\nsupports a compact function, the scaling function \u03c6j,l (x).

Since \u03b7 < 0.3, we\nneed to consider only a few low order corrections, say n \u2264 3. On\nthe other hand, for high j (small scales) case, we have 2j \u226b 1, or\n2j \u226b n, and therefore, the \u03b7 correction on the l-band of \u03c8\u0306jp (lm)\nis small when j is large.\nOne can then conclude that, for different j, the wavelet\n\u03c8\u0306jp (lm) consists of ajm in different l-band, or the l-bands for j\nand j \u2032 (j 6= j \u2032 ) basically are not overlapped. From eq.(B14), the\ncoefficients alm in different l-bands are uncorrelated. Thus, the covariance h\u01eb\u0303jp \u01eb\u0303j \u2032 p\u2032 i should be diagonal or quasi-diagonal as\nh\u01eb\u0303jp \u01eb\u0303j \u2032 p\u2032 i \u2243 0,\n\nwhere \u03c8\u0302jl (k1 , k2 ) is the Fourier transform of the wavelet. In the\nlast step of eq.(B16), we used Eq.(B4), k1 =\npk cos \u03c6, k2 = k sin \u03c6\n1 \u2212 | sin \u03b8|. Wavelet\n(or k = (k12 + k22 )1/2 ) and cos \u03b8\u2032 \u2261\n\u03c8\u0302jl (k1 , k2 ) is localized in k-space. For a given j = (j1 , j2 ),\n\u03c8\u0302jl (k1 , k2 ) is localized in the range 2\u03c02j1 \u22121/2 /R < k1 <\n2\u03c02j1 +1/2 /R and 2\u03c02j2 \u22121/2 /R < k2 < 2\u03c02j2 +1/2 /R. Therefore, for the case j1 = j2 = j, the wavelet \u03c8\u0302jl (k1 , k2 ) is localized\nin the k-band of 2\u03c02j /R < k < 2\u03c02j+1 /R.\nAfter the integral on azimuthal angle \u03c6, eq.(B16) gives\nZ\n\u221a\n2l + 1\n\u03c8\u0306jp (lm) = \u03b40m\ndk1 dk2 \u03c8\u0302jp (k1 , k2 )\n(B17)\n2\u03c0 3/2\n\nZ\n\nwhere jl (x) is spherical Bessel function. First, we take approximation cos \u03b8\u2032 \u2243 cos \u03b8, eq.(B18) gives\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2l + 1 l\n\u03c8\u0306jp (lm) = \u03b40m\ndk1 dk2 \u03c8\u0302jp (k1 , k2 )jl ( 2Rk)(B19)\ni\n3/2\n\u03c0\n\n2j+3/2 < l < 2j+5/2 .\n\n\u03b4 D [x2 \u2212 X2 (\u03a9)]Ylm (\u03a9)d\u03a9dx1 dx2\n\n9\n\nif j 6= j\u2032 .\n\n(B21)\n\n\f"}
