The frequency of lensing events is a\nsensitive probe of the cosmological constant (e.g. Turner\n1990; Kochanek 1995, 1996a) and the density of the universe (Kochanek 1995; Mortlock & Webster 2000a). Individual lenses can be used to constrain the mass distribution\nof the deflector (e.g. Chen, Kochanek & Hewitt 1995; Chae,\nTurnshek & Khersonsky 1998; Keeton, Kochanek & Falco\n1998), the mass of galactic halo objects (e.g. Schmidt &\nWambsganss 1998; Wyithe, Webster & Turner 2000b), extinction in the lens galaxy (e.g. Malhotra, Rhoads & Turner\n1997; Falco et al. 1999), and Hubble's constant (e.g. Refsdal\n1964; Grogin & Narayan 1996; Kundi\u0107 et al. 1997). Further,\ngravitational lensing is one of the only means by which these\nproperties of high-redshift galaxies can be probed.\nConversely, lenses with low-redshift deflectors are also\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: mortlock@ast.cam.ac.uk (DJM); rwebster@physics.\nunimelb.edu.au (RLW)\nc 2000 RAS\n\nparticularly useful, but for rather different reasons. The best\nillustration of this is Q 2237+0305 (Huchra et al. 1985), a\nquadruply-imaged quasar at a redshift of 1.69, seen through\nthe bulge of a spiral galaxy at a redshift of 0.04. The proximity of the lens galaxy is such that it is detectable in H i\n(Barnes et al. 1999), has an optically measured velocity dispersion (Foltz et al. 1992), and can be resolved on scales\nof <\n\u223c 100 pc by the Hubble Space Telescope. These results\nare unremarkable in themselves, but can be combined with\nlensing constraints to provide a wealth of information about\nboth the galaxy and the lensed quasar. The macroscopic\nproperties of the images allow accurate determinations of\nthe mass distribution and mass-to-light ratio of the galaxy\n(e.g. Yee 1988; Kent & Falco 1988) and, combined with their\nobserved position angles, the disk and bar can be weighed independently (Schmidt, Webster & Lewis 1998). Microlensing\nof the quasar images by compact objects within the galaxy\npermits the measurement of their mean mass (Lewis & Irwin 1996; Wyithe, Webster & Turner 2000a), as well as a\ndetermination of the continuum source size of the quasar\n(Wambsganss, Paczy\u0144ski & Schneider 1990; Rauch & Bland-\n\n\f2\n\nD. J. Mortlock and R. L. Webster\n\nford 1992; Wyithe et al. 2000c), and even the transverse motion of the galaxy relative to the line-of-sight to the quasar\n(Wyithe, Webster & Turner 1999).\nAfter Q 2237+0305, the second nearest deflector is the\nredshift 0.11 elliptical galaxy that lenses the radio source\nMG 1549+3047 (Leh\u00e1r et al. 1993). Both the mass distribution and velocity dispersion of the galaxy have been measured (Leh\u00e1r et al. 1996), but the greater distance to the\nlens and less optimal source alignment place limits on the\ninferences that can be made from this system.\nIt is clearly desirable to have a larger sample of lenses\nwith low-redshift deflectors. Each would have the potential\nto provide as much insight as Q 2237+0305 and a sufficiently\nlarge sample could be used to extrapolate from the above results to the galaxy and source populations (e.g. Keeton et\nal. 1998). The limitations of the various lens survey techniques are discussed in Section 2, with particular emphasis\non the use of galaxy redshift survey (GRS) spectra as the\nprimary data. Section 3 describes a simple model of the various populations of objects that determine the viability of\nthis method. In Section 4 specific predictions are made for\nvarious existing and planned redshift surveys, and the results summarised in Section 5.\n\n2\n\nLENS SURVEYS\n\nLensed quasars are very rare, with less than 50 known to\ndate (e.g. Keeton & Kochanek 1996). At most 1 in \u223c 100\n(and probably closer to 1 in \u223c1000) quasars brighter than\nm \u2243 19 are lensed, which implies a surface density of\n\u22122\n<\n\u223c 0.1 deg . This is several orders of magnitude lower\nthan the integrated number counts of stars (\u223c1000 deg\u22122 ;\ne.g. Jones et al. 1991), galaxies (\u223c 100 deg\u22122 ; e.g. Maddox et al. 1990b), and unlensed quasars (\u223c 10 deg\u22122 ; e.g.\nHewett, Foltz & Chaffee 1995) to the same limit. Thus lensed\nquasars represent between 0.001 per cent and 0.01 per cent of\n'bright' optical sources. Quasars (and hence lenses) represent\na larger fraction of the radio source counts, and a number of\nlarge radio lens surveys exist (e.g. Patnaik et al. 1992; Myers\net al. 1995). Unfortunately the lack of knowledge about the\nluminosity function and redshift distribution of the sources\nlimits the power of any statistical results (Kochanek 1996b).\nCompounding these problems, considerable observational effort is required to both identify candidate lenses\nand to then confirm their identity. Most are discovered in\nlens surveys (e.g. Burke, Leh\u00e1r & Connor 1992; Crampton,\nMcClure & Fletcher 1992; Maoz et al. 1992; Patnaik et al.\n1992; Maoz et al. 1993a,b; Surdej et al. 1993; Yee, Filippenko & Tang 1993; Falco 1994; Kochanek, Falco & Schild\n1995; Jackson et al. 1995; Jaunsen et al. 1995) which are\nbased on existing quasar (or extra-Galactic radio-source)\nsamples. These catalogues in themselves represent a great\ndeal of work, as initial multi-colour selection of candidates\nmust then be followed by confirmation spectroscopy of each\npotential quasar. However there are now a number of large\nquasar samples in existence (e.g. Boyle, Shanks & Peterson\n1988; Warren, Hewett & Osmer 1991; Hewitt & Burbidge\n1993; Hewett et al. 1995) or in preparation (e.g. Loveday\n& Pier 1998; Boyle et al. 1999a,b), so any new lens survey\ncan proceed from these object lists. Under this assumption,\na lens survey then requires high-resolution imaging of be-\n\ntween 100 and 1000 fields (i.e. one for each quasar) per lens\ndiscovery. (Further observations of any probable lenses are\nusually required to establish the lensing interpretation beyond doubt, but these represent only a small part of the\noverall task.)\nThe efficiency of a lens survey can be increased by the\nuse of morphological selection criteria, for instance choosing only highly-elliptical sources for further investigation.\nKochanek (1991) found that, whilst the efficiency of such\nsearches is quite high, they can be very incomplete, finding\nonly \u223c 20 per cent of all lenses. This conclusion was consistent with the results of the Automatic Plate Measuring\n(APM) lens survey (Webster, Hewett & Irwin 1988), which\ncontains no lenses amongst \u223c 2500 elliptical sources with\nquasar-like colours.\nLens surveys also tend to miss some of the most interesting multiply-imaged quasars. These include those with\nhigh extinction and reddening from dust along the line-ofsight, and those with low-redshift lens galaxies. As discussed\nabove, the latter can be very valuable indeed, but cannot be\nfound in lens surveys they are not likely to enter the quasar\nsurveys in the first place, due to both their morphologies (appearing simply to be nearby galaxies at all but the highest\nresolutions) and colours (which are likely to be galaxy-like).\nLenses with low-redshift deflectors can only be found by\nsearching for quasar emission lines in the spectra obtained\nin GRSs.\nIndeed, Q 2237+0305 was discovered as a lens when it\nwas noticed that one of the galaxies in the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) redshift survey (Geller & Huchra 1989) had\nan unusual spectrum. Follow up spectroscopy and imagining confirmed that the object was in fact a lens. Whilst\nQ 2237+0305 represents, a posteriori, an unlikely alignment\u2020 , it is quite probable that other lenses will be discovered in redshift surveys, given that at least 1 in 106 redshifts\nwill yield a lens (Kochanek 1992). Aside from the CfA survey (which includes \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 104 objects), several other large\nGRSs have already been completed. The Las Campanas\nRedshift Survey (LCRS; Shectman et al. 1996) and the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) 1.2 Jy survey (Fisher\net al. 1995) have both measured upwards of 104 galactic redshifts, and so may contain a few lenses between them. With\n\u223c 9 \u00d7 105 galaxies, the Muenster Redshift Project (MRSP;\nSchuecker, Ott & Seitter 1996) dwarfs the other completed\nsurveys, but is probably less useful as a source of lenses, the\nredshifts having been measured from low-dispersion objective prism spectra, as opposed to higher-resolution spectrographic data. In the future, the 2 degree Field (2dF) GRS\n(e.g. Colless 1999; Folkes et al. 1999) will include \u223c 2.5\u00d7105\nredshift measurements, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS; e.g. Szalay 1998; Loveday & Pier 1998) will contain about one million galaxies. The SDSS could yield 'several tens' of spectroscopically-discovered lenses (Kochanek\n1992), although it will also include high-resolution imaging,\nand thus should find a large number of lenses 'directly'. Importantly, these estimates are really only lower bounds on\nthe number of lenses in GRSs, as previous calculations did\nnot take into account two important observational effects.\n\n\u2020 Kochanek (1992) estimated the probability of a lens being discovered in the CfA survey was \u223c 0.003, but see Section 4.1.\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fLensing in redshift surveys\nThe first is similar to the standard lensing magnification\nbias (e.g. Turner 1980), in which the number of lenses in a\nmagnitude-limited sample is increased as intrinsically faint\nlensed sources are preferentially magnified into the survey.\nIn a galaxy sample there is the additional effect that the\nmagnified quasar images tend to be merged with the lens\ngalaxy, making the composite object appear brighter. In this\nway (potential) lens galaxies up to one mag fainter than the\nsurvey limit can enter a GRS sample. As shown in Section 3,\nthis effect can increase the number of lenses in a redshift\nsurvey by up to an order of magnitude.\nThe second effect is complementary to this, as it only\nbecomes important if the lens galaxy is much fainter than\nthe quasar images (which is true of most lenses discovered\nto date). Such a lens would appear as several point sources,\nbut might enter a GRS by virtue of appearing to be a single\nextended source in the low-resolution data from which survey catalogues are generated. This is a potentially important\npossibility, but it is highly-dependent on the details of the\nsurvey selection effects and point-spread function (PSF), as\ndiscussed in Sections 3 and 4.\nAssuming that a number of the objects in a GRS are\nlenses, and are hence observed spectroscopically as a matter of course, a minimal number of confirmation observations are required to find them. This method is only practical if it is possible to differentiate between quasar spectra\nand galaxy spectra (as well as those of stars, white dwarfs,\netc.), which, fortunately, is reasonably straight-forward, due\nto their prominent, broad emission lines. Other than the\nlenses, the only objects that will be selected in this way are\nany unlensed quasars that appear extended in the parent\nsurvey. These must also be re-imaged, and so the number of\nunlensed quasars in a GRS determines the efficiency of this\ntype of lens search.\n\n3\n\nSOURCE POPULATIONS\n\nThe difficulty of finding gravitational lenses is principally\na function of their rarity, so any assessment of search\nmethods must include an estimate of the total number\nof sources which must be investigated per lens detection.\nThe source populations considered are: stars (Section 3.1);\ngalaxies (Section 3.2); unlensed quasars (Section 3.3); and\nlensed quasars (Section 3.4). Each population is defined by\nN (< m), the number of objects per unit solid angle brighter\nthan magnitude\u2021 m, which is shown for each of the four\nclasses of objects in Fig. 1.\nIn this simple model, the morphology of an object is\nconsidered to be completely defined by its ellipticity,\ne=1\u2212\n\n\"\n\nMxx + Myy \u2212\nMxx + Myy +\n\np\n\n(Mxx \u2212 Myy )2 + 4Mxy\n\np\n\n(Mxx \u2212 Myy\n\n)2\n\n+ 4Mxy\n\n#1/2\n\n2\n\nMyy = h(\u03b8y \u2212 h\u03b8y i) i\n\n, (1)\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\u2021 The analysis presented here is reasonably generic, but in general\nBJ or B magnitudes are considered.\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\nFigure 1.

The Kcorrections of Kinney et al.

The shape distribution of each population is then defined by dp/de|<m ,\nthe ellipticity distribution of all objects brighter than m.\nThis is a significant simplification, the limitations of which\nare discussed where relevant.

For each source population the number over the whole\nsky is N (< mlim )[1 \u2212 p(< emin )|<mlim ], which must then be\nnormalised by Ntot , the number of objects in the survey.\nThe limitations of this model are discussed where relevant,\nbut, despite its simplicity, it provides a reasonable estimate\nof the relative numbers of galaxies, stars and other objects\nthat are observed spectroscopically in a galaxy survey. The\nellipticity cut-off determines both the completeness, C, and\nefficiency, E, of a GRS of a given magnitude limit; the resultant values of these parameters can then be used to assess\nthe limitations of the model.\nA survey's completeness is the fraction of all galaxies\nwhich appear in the sample, and is simply\nC(emin , mlim ) = 1 \u2212 pg (< emin )|<mlim ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere pg (< e)|<m is given in equation (13).

This is shown\nfor surveys of varying depth in Fig. 3, and the limitations\nof ellipticity as a means of star-galaxy separation are exposed. For a given magnitude limit the optimal choice of\nemin is close to the point where C = E, although slightly\nhigher completeness may be preferable. Using emin \u2243 0.15\ncan result in completenesses and efficiencies of \u223c 90 per cent\nfor mlim \u2243 19, but more sophisticated techniques based on\nsurface brightness profiles (e.g. Maddox et al. 1990a) can\nachieve >\n\u223c 95 per cent for both to fainter limits.\nThe redshift coverage of a given GRS is of intrinsic interest, and it can also determine the lensing statistics within\nit (e.g. Kochanek 1992), depending on the selection effects.\nThe redshift distribution of the galaxies is not independent\nof the ellipticity cut-off \u2013 the fainter and hence more distant\ngalaxies are those likely to be omitted, reducing the highredshift tail of the sample \u2013 but it is not a dominant effect,\nand is ignored here.

The\nfaint end of the quasar luminosity function is important too,\nas it affects lensing statistics due to magnification bias. The\nredshift distribution of the sources is also necessary, as lensing probability increases so rapidly with source redshift (e.g.\nTurner, Ostriker & Gott 1984; Kochanek 1993a).\n\n> 21) quasars, as the deeptainty in the number of faint (m \u223c\nest quasar samples may be significantly incomplete. This\npossibility can be tested by 'complete' spectroscopic surveys, in which there is no morphological or chromatic preselection. Results from the deepest such sample, the Fornax\nspectroscopic survey (Drinkwater et al. 1999), are shown in\nFig. 1, but they do not differ greatly from the Hartwick &\nSchade (1990) compilation of data. Clearly a complete spectroscopic survey to m >\n\u223c 21 would be of great interest.\n3.3.2\n\nEllipticity distribution\n\nAs with stars, quasars can appear extended on photographic\nplates due to random noise. Their ellipticity distribution is\nlikely to be similar to that of stars, but with more outliers,\ndue to gravitational lensing and close quasar-galaxy associations. As strongly-lensed quasars are considered explicitly\nhere, the ellipticity distribution of unlensed quasars is assumed to be the same as that of stars, so that dpq /de|<m =\ndps /de|<m [equation (7) and Fig. 2].\n3.4\n\nLensed quasars\n\nThe statistics of quasar lensing are most often framed in\nterms of the probability, pq , that a given quasar is lensed.\nHere, however, it is more useful to consider lensed quasars as\na population of objects in their own right, distinct in particular from the unlensed quasar population. The differential\nnumber of lenses with source redshift z and magnitude m is\nrelated to the lensing probability by\nd2 Nl\nd2 Nq\n= pq\n,\ndmdz\ndmdz\n\nwhere d2 Nq /dmdz, is given in Section 3.3. The integral number counts of lenses is then simply\nNl (< m) =\n\n3.3.1\n\nThe differential quasar number counts, as a function of magnitude, m, and redshift, z, are given by\nd2 Nq\n3[1 \u2212 (z/zmax )2 ]\nNq0\n=\n, (19)\ndmdz\n6 + zmax\n10\u03b1q (m\u2212mq0 ) \u2212 10\u03b2q (m\u2212mq0 )\nwhere m0 = 19.0 \u00b1 0.2 is the quasar break magnitude, \u03b1q =\n0.9 \u00b1 0.1 is the bright-end slope, \u03b2q = 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 is the faintend slope, and Nq0 = (4.1\u00b10.4)\u00d7105 = 10\u00b11 deg\u22122 (Boyle\net al. 1988; Kochanek 1996a), and zmax = 3.2 is chosen to\nmatch the redshift dependence of the Large Bright Quasar\nSurvey (Hewett et al. 1995).

The lenses that are missed in\nfollow-up observations (those with small image separations\nor high flux ratios) also have small ellipticities, and so are\nexcluded from the model redshift surveys by the ellipticity\ncut described below and in Section 3.\nAll three galaxy types are modelled as singular isothermal spheres (Turner et al. 1984; Binney & Tremaine 1987;\nKochanek 1994), which are consistent with lens statistics\n(e.g. Kochanek 1993a, 1996a) but cannot produce the more\ncomplex image configurations observed. Their mass distribution is characterised by \u03c3, the dark matter velocity dispersion, which is marginally larger than the observed line-ofsight velocity dispersion, \u03c3|| , as shown by Kochanek (1994)\nand Mortlock & Webster (2000b). The line-of-sight dispersion is related to M , the absolute magnitude of the lens\ngalaxy, by the Faber-Jackson (1976) relationship for Es and\nS0s, and the Tully-Fisher (1977) relationship\u00a7 for spirals.\nBoth conversions have the same mathematical form, so\n\u00a7 The Tully-Fisher (1977) relationship actually gives the circular\n\u221a\nspeed, which is equal to 2\u03c3.\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fLensing in redshift surveys\n\n7\n\nFigure 4.

The exception to this is when the lens galaxy is of comparable brightness to the quasar images (e.g. Q 2237+0305),\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\"\n\n\u03b2x\n\u03b2y\n\n#\n\n\uf8ee\n\n=\uf8f0\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b30 \u2212\n\n\u03b8E\n\u03b8\n\n1 + \u03b30 \u2212\n\n\u03b8E\n\u03b8\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03b8x\n\u03b8y\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = (\u03b2x , \u03b2y ) is the angular source position, \u03b8 =\n(\u03b8x , \u03b8y ) is the angular image position. This can be solved using the method outlined by Schneider et al. (1992), in which\nthe radial components of the image positions are given by\nthe roots of a one-dimensional equation.\nIn order to obtain the ellipticity distribution of lensed\nquasars, Monte Carlo simulations of \u223c 105 lenses were generated for several different deflector models. The integration over the quasar population was performed by using pq\n[equation (3)] and d2 Nq /dzdm to draw sources randomly\nfrom population of lensed quasars, and a lens galaxy was\nsimilarly-generated for each source. The source position, \u03b2,\nwas biased in favour of close alignments using the magnification bias described above, but no other selection effects\nwere included. For each source-lens pair the lens equation\nwas solved to give image positions, \u03b8 i and magnifications,\n\n\u00b6 The use of an elliptical lens model is more realistic, but more\nexpensive computationally.

The profile\ncannot be normalised if \u03b7 \u2264 1, and in the limiting case of\n\u03b7 \u2192 \u221e it becomes a Gaussian. The default value assumed\nby the image reduction and analysis facility software\n(Tody 1986) is \u03b7 = 2.5, but results such as those of Saglia\net al. (1993) imply that \u03b7 \u2243 3. Conversely the areal profiles\nof stellar images in the APM survey shown in Maddox et al.\n(1990a) are close to log-linear, suggesting \u03b7 is very high.\nUsing this PSF the ellipticity can be found analytically,\nalthough the result is rather cumbersome, except if Ni = 2.\n\n102\u2206m/5\n(1 + 102\u2206m/5 )2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206\u03b8\n\u03b8s /2\n\n\u00132 #1/2\n\n,\n\nwhere \u2206\u03b8 is the angular separation of the images and\n\u2206m is their magnitude difference. This is only defined for\n\u03b7 > 2, and reduces to the simpler Gaussian form found by\nKochanek (1991) in the limit of \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e. Fig. 6 shows e as\na function of \u2206\u03b8 for several values of \u2206m and two extreme\nvalues of \u03b7. For a given image separation and seeing, e decreases with increasing \u2206m, the pair becoming more like a\nsingle point source. The ellipticity also decreases with decreasing \u03b7, the wings of the PSF 'diluting' the ellipticity of\nthe two images. More generally, it is clear that small separation (\u2206\u03b8 <\n\u223c 1 arcsec) lenses stand little chance of being\nclassified as anything but stars.\nUsing the above formulation to calculate e for each simulated lens gives a distribution, dpl /de|<m , that is dependent mainly on \u03b30 and the PSF. There is only weak dependence on the cosmological model, the magnitude limit of the\nsurvey, and the scale velocity dispersion of the galaxies (as\nh\u2206\u03b8i \u221d \u03c3\u22172 ; Kochanek 1993b). Fig. 7 shows the cumulative\nellipticity distribution, pl (< e)|<m , for various values of the\nmodel parameters. The critical value is 1 \u2212 pl (< emin )|<m ,\nas this is the fraction of lenses that would enter any given\nGRS. From the completeness and efficiency arguments in\nSection 3.2, 0.1 <\n\u223c 0.2; this range is delineated by the\n\u223c emin <\nvertical dashed lines. An external shear of 0.2 can reduce the\nnumber of 'elliptical' (i.e. e > emin ) lenses by up to a factor\nof four, but the effects of the PSF are clearly more important. Increasing \u03b8s from 2 arcsec to 3 arcsec decreases the\nnumber of elliptical lenses by \u223c 30 per cent in Gaussian seeing, but results in an order of magnitude decrease if \u03b7 \u2243 2.5.\nWith \u03b7 <\n\u223c 0.3\n\u223c pl (< e)|<m <\n\u223c 3 the PSF is broader, and 0.1 <\n<\n(for 2 arcsec seeing) or 0.05 \u223c pl (< e)|<m <\n\u223c 0.2 (for 3 arcsec seeing). The strong dependence on the shape of the PSF\nshows that the wings do contribute significantly to the ellipticity of multiple images, contrary to the assumption of\nKochanek (1991). The variation in PSF between different\nsets of observational parameters thus places limits on the\naccuracy of any generic predictions of the number of lenses\nthat will enter a GRS.\n\n3.4.2\n\nLenses with visible deflectors\n\nIn the most pessimistic scenario presented above, only about\n5 per cent of all lensed quasars are sufficiently elliptical to\nenter a GRS as candidate galaxies, in which case there would\nbe only limited use in searching GRS spectra for potential\nlenses. However the simulation did not take into account the\nlight from the deflector.

The horizontal dashed lines are at e = 0.1 and e = 0.2, reasonable limits for the ellipticity cut-off used to select objects\nfor galaxy surveys.\n\nFigure 7.

The lens model is a singular isothermal\nsphere with an external shear of: \u03b30 = 0.0 (solid lines); \u03b30 = 0.1 (dashed lines); and \u03b30 = 0.2 (dot-dashed lines). The three lines for\neach lens model are for different values of the \u03b7-parameter used in the definition of the PSF [equation (29)]: \u03b7 = 2.5 (upper lines); \u03b7 = 3\n(middle lines); and \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e (i.e. Gaussian seeing; lower lines). The vertical dashed lines indicate reasonable values for the ellipticity cut-off\nused to select objects for a galaxy survey, and this can be used to obtain the fraction of lenses retained.\n\nbut the quasar is also bright enough that the composite spectrum is distinguishable from that of an isolated galaxy, the\nlens will both enter the redshift survey and be detectable\nspectroscopically. Kochanek (1992) performed an 'initial, order of magnitude' estimate of the statistics of such lenses,\nbut the contribution of the quasar light to the observed magnitude of the compound object was neglected. This is an\nimportant effect, as it increases the effective depth of the\nlens survey by \u223c 1 mag, and can result in up to an order of\nmagnitude more lenses.\nDefining mg as the magnitude of (just) the galaxy, and\nmq as the total, lensed magnitude of all the quasar images,\nthe observed magnitude of a lens is given by\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\nm = \u22125/2 log 10\u22122/5 mq + 10\u22122/5 mg .\n\n\u0001\n\n(33)\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 8, a lens with these properties will be\nincluded in a redshift survey of limiting magnitude mlim if\nthe following three criteria are met:\n(i) The lens must be bright enough to enter the GRS at\nall, i.e. m < mlim , which is shown by the curved line in\nFig. 8. This gives the extra depth relative to the redshift\nsurvey proper, for which the flux cut-off is mg < mlim .\n(ii) The quasar must be sufficiently bright, relative to the\nlens galaxy, that its emission lines are detectable in the GRS\nspectrum. Following Kochanek (1992), this requirement is\nmodelled as mg \u2212 mq < \u2206mqg , which is given by the upper\n\n\fD. J. Mortlock and R. L. Webster\n\n10\n\nof the two diagonal cuts in Fig. 8. Due to the strong, broad\nemission lines present in most quasar spectra (e.g. Peterson\n1997), \u2206mqg \u2243 2 is assumed unless stated otherwise. This\nvalue is also supported by the discovery of Q 2237+0305 as\ndescribed in Kochanek (1992).\n(iii) The galaxy must be sufficiently bright that the the\nlens is classified as a galaxy in the low-resolution data from\nwhich the GRS is selected. This is assumed to be the case\nif mq \u2212 mg < \u2206mgq , which is shown as the lower diagonal cut in Fig. 8. The value of \u2206mgq is somewhat uncertain, and could even be negativek if galaxies with superimposed stellar components are reliably removed from the\nsample. In the case of Q 2237+0305, mq \u2243 mg + 1, but the\ngalaxy appears unremarkable at low resolution, suggesting\nthat \u2206mgq \u2243 0. The simulations of the APM galaxy survey\npresented in Mortlock & Webster (2000c) further imply that\n0<\n\u223c 1. In other words, the galaxy need contribute\n\u223c \u2206mgq <\nonly half the flux of a lens for it to be classified as non-stellar,\nand hence included in a GRS. If the 'elliptical' lenses considered previously enter GRSs, they could be included in this\nformalism by taking \u2206mgq \u2192 \u221e.\nIt is now possible to calculate pq,g , the probability that\na given galaxy (with redshift zg and magnitude mg ) lenses\na given quasar [with redshift z, and lensed magnitude mq ,\ndefined in terms of m and mg , in equation (33)].

The range of deflector and source magnitudes (mg\nand mq , respectively) probed by a GRS of magnitude limit mlim .\nLenses with \u22125/2 log(10\u22122/5 mq + 10\u22122/5 mg ) > mlim are omitted as the combined flux from both the quasar and lens galaxy is\nbelow the flux limit. The survey is assumed to have \u2206mqg = 2 (all\nlenses with mq \u2212 mg > \u2206mqg being omitted as the quasar is too\nfaint to be detectable spectroscopically) and \u2206mgq = 1 (all lenses\nwith mg \u2212 mq > \u2206mgq being omitted as the galaxy is too faint to\nmake the lens appear extended). Hence only those lenses which lie\nin the un-hatched region are included. The heavy solid lines show\nthe boundaries of the equivalent region used by Kochanek (1992) \u2013\nthe inclusion of the lenses for which mg > mlim is far more important than exclusion of the lenses in which the galaxy is too faint.\nThis last point is illustrated by the scatter plot within the allowed region, which shows the distribution of galaxy-quasar pairs\ngenerated from their respective number counts [equations (12)\nand (20)]. For the scatter plot mlim = 19 was assumed, and the\nquasars, being strongly lensed, are assumed to be magnified by a\nfactor of 4 on average.\n\nd2 Nl\ndz.\ndmdz\n\n(38)\n\nThe values of Nl implied are discussed in Section 4.1, but it\nis immediately clear from the distribution of galaxy-quasar\npairs in Fig. 8 that the majority of the lenses are included\nk If \u2206mgq < \u2212\u2206mqg , then the only lenses included would be\nthose with quasars too faint to be detectable, and the lensing\nprobability would be zero.\n\n4\n\nRESULTS\n\nCombining the various populations of objects considered\nin Section 3, it is possible to make predictions about the\nnumber of lenses found in particular redshift surveys (Section 4.1) as well as the usefulness of this search method\n(Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).\n\n4.1\n\nNumber of lenses\n\nFrom the number counts given in Section 3, the number of\nobjects of type t which enter a given redshift survey is\nNt = Ntot P\n\nNt (< mlim )[1 \u2212 pt (< emin )|<mlim ]\n,\nNt\u2032 (< mlim)[1 \u2212 pt\u2032 (< emin )|<mlim ]\nt\u2032\n\n(39)\n\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fLensing in redshift surveys\nwhere Ntot is the total number of objects in the survey,\nmlim the magnitude limit and emin the ellipticity cut-off.\nThe sum is over all the populations (i.e. t = s, g, q or l, for\nstars, galaxies, unlensed quasars and lenses, respecitvely),\nalthough only stars and galaxies make a significant contribution to the denominator.\nFig. 9 shows the number of 'elliptical' lenses (and other\nobjects) per 104 redshifts as a function of mlim (chosen to\nfacilitate comparison with Kochanek 1992) for a number of\ndifferent observing conditions. The lens fraction remains essentially constant at about 1 in 105 (a) or 1 in 104 (b), decreasing very slowly as mlim increases, due to the decreased\nmagnification bias. For bright surveys this is far greater than\nthe numbers of lenses with bright deflectors considered by\nKochanek (1992), but it is not at all certain that the 'elliptical' lenses will enter a typical GRS.\nMultiply-imaged quasars with lens galaxies close to the\nsurvey limit should definitely enter galaxy samples, and so\nthey give a lower bound on Nl . As can be seen from Fig. 10,\nthese lenses are considerably rarer than the 'elliptical' lenses\nat bright magnitudes, but their numbers increase rapidly\nwith mlim , due to the steepness of the quasar luminosity\nfunction (Section 3.3). Fig. 10 can be compared directly with\nthe results of Kochanek (1992), although Nl is higher by a\nfactor of \u223c 5, due to the inclusion of the quasars' light in\nthe calculation. This immediately implies that the majority\nof any such lensed quasars found in redshift surveys should\nhave lens galaxies which are actually fainter than the survey\nlimit, as can be seen from Fig. 8. Other than the depth of the\nsurvey, Nl is determined mainly by \u2206mqg , with \u2206mgq somewhat less important. The strong dependence of Nl on \u2206mqg\nis again purely a function of the quasar number counts, but,\nbeing a measure of how sensitive a redshift survey is to the\npresence of quasar emission features, it can be determined\n'experimentally' by running the survey software on the spectra of simulated lenses. The value of \u2206mgq is more difficult\nto determine; fortunately it does not greatly affect the lens\nstatistics, provided that \u2206mqg >\n\u223c 1. The cosmological model\nalso has little impact on the number of lenses with visible deflectors, as the lens galaxies are so close-by that the\nobserver-source and deflector-source distances are approximately equal (Kochanek 1992).\nThese above results are summarised for a number of\nreal redshift surveys in Table 1. None of the surveys have\nbeen systematically searched for lenses, although all the CfA\nsurvey spectra were examined by eye, and it was process\nthat led to the discovery of Q 2237+0305 as a lens. If 'elliptical' lenses were included in the survey, the detection\nof a lens is not unexpected; however the CfA GRS is so\nbright (hmi \u2243 15) that multiple point sources should have\nbeen reasonably easy to remove from the sample. Assuming\nonly those lenses with visible, low-redshift deflectors were\nincluded, the expected number of lenses in the CfA survey\nis \u223c 0.03. In other words, about 1 in 30 CfA-like galaxy\nsamples should contain a spectroscopic quasar lens. This is\nconsiderably higher than the previous estimates of \u223c 0.0002\n(Huchra et al. 1985) and \u223c 0.003 (Kochanek et al. 1992); the\nreason for this increase is simply the inclusion of the quasars'\nlight in the calculation. Note also that Q 2237+0305 is actually fainter than the survey limit, which is consistent with\nthe conclusion that galaxies with mg >\n\u223c mlim dominate the\nlens statistics.\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n11\n\nOf the other large redshift surveys that have already\nbeen completed, both the European Southern Observatory\nSlice Project (ESP; Vettolani et al. 1997) and the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC2) sample (Yee, Ellingson & Carlberg 1996) are too small to present\nany real likelihood of lensing. The million galaxies in the\nMRSP (Schuecker et al. 1996) could include a number of\nlenses, although only objective prism spectra were used\nfor the redshift determination. The selection of candidate\nquasars from low-grade spectra is an established technique\n(e.g. Hewett et al. 1995), but this would represent a considerable undertaking, as the low resolution data would generate\na large number of false candidates lenses for which further\nobservations would be required. Thus the most promising of\nthe completed galaxy surveys is the LCRS (Shectman et al.\n1996) \u2013 it is larger than the CfA survey, as well as being\ndeeper (hmi \u2243 19), and should contain one or two lenses\n(c.f. Fig. 10).\nThe two surveys listed in Table 1 which have not been\ncompleted are also the most ambitious, and are likely to yield\nthe most lenses. The 2dF GRS (e.g. Colless 1999; Folkes et\nal. 1999) should contain at least 10 lenses, and as many as 50\nif the cosmological model and observational parameters are\noptimal. Either way, it would represent the largest sample of\nlensed quasars generated from a single survey. However the\n2dF instrument has very small optical fibres (effective radius\n1 arcsec), and is unusually sensitive to a number of surface\nbrightness-related selection effects. The impact of these on\nNl is studied in more detail in Mortlock & Webster (2000c).\nThe SDSS (e.g. Szalay 1998; Loveday & Pier 1998)\nis four times the size of 2dF, and the spectra will be of\nconsiderably better quality. Assuming \u2206mqg \u2243 4 implies\nthat Nl >\n\u223c 100. Further, the survey will also include highresolution imaging of \u223c 104 deg2 , which should allow the\nmorphological identification of an even larger number of lens\ncandidates. The number counts shown in Fig. 1 then imply\nthat the SDSS should contain between 200 (if \u03a9m0 = 1.0\nand \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.0) and 1000 (if \u03a9m0 = 0.7 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.3).\n4.2\n\nControl samples\n\nKochanek (1992) suggested two control samples \u2013 foreground stars and unlensed quasars \u2013 from which the efficiency and completeness of the lens search could be calibrated. However these objects are only useful controls if\nthey enter the GRS mainly through chance superpositions\nwith survey galaxies. Unfortunately, most of the stars and\nunlensed quasars in the survey are not there due to chance\nalignments, but misclassification (e.g. Fig. 9). For instance,\nthe limitations APM star-galaxy separation algorithm (e.g.\nMaddox et al. 1990a) imply that, of the \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 105 objects\nin the 2dF GRS, several thousand will be stars, compared\nto only several tens of star-galaxy superpositions. With the\nexception of the brightest surveys (mlim <\n\u223c 18), the same is\nalso true for unlensed quasars.\nThis effectively leaves this lens search technique without\nany simple calibration, which is not important if the aim is\nsimply to discover new lenses, but must be addressed if lensing probabilities are to be determined. One possibility is to\nperform both morphological and spectroscopic calibration a\nposteriori by simulating quasar-galaxy lenses and analysing\nthem using the software actually used for the survey. This\n\n\f12\n\nD. J. Mortlock and R. L. Webster\n\nFigure 9. The expected number, Nt , of galaxies, stars, unlensed quasars and lensed quasars in a GRS as a function of the magnitude\nlimit, mlim . The number of lenses is calculated using the spherical lens model (i.e. \u03b30 = 0) in three cosmologies: \u03a9m0 = 1.0 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.0\n(lower solid line); \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.0 (middle solid line); and \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.7 (upper solid line). The GRS is selected\nusing an ellipticity cut emin = 0.15, and normalised to Ntot = 104 . The parent survey is assumed to have 3 arcsec seeing and a Moffat\n(1969) PSF with \u03b7 = 2.5 in (a) and \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e (i.e. Gaussian seeing) in (b).\n\nFigure 10. The expected number of lensed quasars, Nl , per 104 measured redshifts, shown (as in Kochanek 1992) as a function of\nmagnitude limit, mlim . Highly elliptical sources are not included in the survey; only galaxies and lenses with \u2212\u2206mgq < mq \u2212mq < \u2206mqg\nand \u22125/2 log(10\u22122/5 mq + 10\u22122/5 mg ) < mlim are included. (See Section 3.4 for a full explanation of these selection criteria.) In each\npanel the three sets of lines represent different values of the spectral prominence of quasars: \u2206mqg = 0 (lower lines); \u2206mqg = 2 (middle\nlines); and \u2206mqg = 4 (upper lines). The morphological threshold for galaxy selection is assumed to be \u2206mgq = 0 in (a) and \u2206mgq = 1\nin (b). For each set of observational limits, three cosmological models are shown: \u03a9m0 = 1.0 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.0 (solid lines); \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and\n\u03a9\u039b0 = 0.0 (dashed lines); and \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.7 (dot-dashed lines).\n\nalso has the advantage of taking into account all of the potential biases in the survey without the need for explicit\nmodelling.\n\n4.3\n\nEfficiency and completeness\n\nThe sheer number of quasars that must be re-imaged per\nlens discovery in a conventional lens survey is prohibitive\n(e.g. Section 1), and it is one of the major reasons that so\nfew lenses are known. The use of morphological selection,\nimplicit in a GRS, can increase the efficiency by removing\nmost of the unlensed quasars from the survey, but there is\n\nalso a significant reduction in the completeness of the lens\nsample.\nThe completeness is simply C = 1 \u2212 pl (< emin )|<mlim ,\nwhere emin is the ellipticity cut of the survey and mlim its\nmagnitude limit. As shown in Fig. 7, this is quite variable,\nwith C ranging between 0.05 and 0.5, depending mainly on\nthe form of the PSF. However a low value of C is not necessarily a problem, provided that its value is reasonably well\nknown. Note that C is unambiguously defined only for the\n'elliptical' lens sample; the lenses with mg \u2243 mq are not\ndrawn from a well-defined parent population.\nMore important is the efficiency, E, which is defined as\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fLensing in redshift surveys\n\n13\n\nTable 1.

For each survey: mlim is the magnitude\nlimit in the band indicated (with approximate conversions to BJ , based on the redshift coverage of the survey); Ntot is the total\nnumber of redshifts measured; Nl is the expected number of lenses; and Nl,min is the expected number of lenses if only those with\nvisible detectors are included in the survey. The variation of Nl with cosmological model and PSF is given explicitly, but the spherical\nlens model and 3 arcsec seeing are assumed. On the other hand, Nl,min is strongly dependent on neither the cosmology, nor the PSF\nin the relevant magnitude range, and so is only shown for the Einstein-de Sitter model. In all cases Nl,min is calculated assuming\n\u2206mgq = 0 and \u2206mqg = 2, except for the MRSP (which uses objective prism spectra, and so has \u2206mqg \u2243 0) and the SDSS (which\nwill obtain high-quality spectra with \u2206mqg \u2243 4).\n\nthe number of high-resolution re-observations required per\nlens discovery. For a redshift survey-based lens search it is\n[c.f. equation (16)]\nEGRS =\n\nNl (< mlim )pl (< emin ) |<mlim\n,\nNq (< mlim )pq (< emin ) |<mlim\n\n(40)\n\nas only those objects with quasar-like spectra need to be reimaged. As shown in Fig. 11, this is generally much higher\nthan the efficiency of a conventional lens survey,\nElens survey =\n\nNl (< mlim )\n,\nNq (< mlim )\n\n(41)\n\nwhere it is optimisticly assumed that the lens sample is\nessentially complete. For bright surveys EGRS \u2243 1 as the\nstar-galaxy separation techniques are so reliable, although\nclose quasar-galaxy associations have not been included. For\nfainter magnitude limits E decreases for both search methods, due to the lower lensing fraction, and for mlim >\n\u223c 20 the\nefficiency of redshift surveys approaches that of lens surveys.\nIf only lenses with bright deflectors enter a galaxy survey, then EGRS is reduced by about an order of magnitude,\nbut is still greater than Elens survey for mlim <\n\u223c 20. Hence the\nefficiency of lens searches based on GRS spectra is almost\nalways greater than that of conventional lens surveys.\n4.4\n\nDeflector redshift distribution\n\nBy evaluating the lensing probability (Section 3.4) for a fixed\ndeflector redshift, the distribution of lens galaxy redshifts,\ndp/dzg , can be found; this is shown in Fig. 12. The 'elliptical'\nlenses have the broad range of deflector redshifts expected of\na conventional lens survey (e.g. Turner et al. 1984), and, in\nparticular, the expected number of nearby deflectors is very\nsmall. The distribution is very different if only lenses with\nvisible lens galaxies are selected \u2013 it roughly matches the\noverall redshift distribution of a GRS with a limiting magnitude of mlim + \u2206mqg (c.f. Fig. 4). Hence the 2dF redshift\nsurvey should yield one or two lenses with zg <\n\u223c 0.1, and\nthe SDSS could contain about ten lenses with such nearby\ndeflectors.\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\nFigure 11. The detection efficiency of a conventional lens survey,\nElens survey (lower lines), and that of a lens search based on a\nredshift survey, EGRS (upper lines), as a function of the limiting\nmagnitude of the survey, mlim . Both are defined in Section 4.3,\nand EGRS is shown for two values of \u03b7 used in the definition of\nthe Moffat (1969) PSF: \u03b7 = 2.5 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e (Gaussian seeing), as\nlabelled. In each case three cosmological models are used: \u03a9m0 =\n1.0 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.0 (solid lines); \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.0 (dashed\nlines); and \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.7 (dot-dashed lines).\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nDue to the imperfect discrimination between galaxies and\nother celestial objects, gravitationally-lensed quasars enter\nGRS catalogues, and should then be detectable spectroscopically. The gravitational lens Q 2237+0305 was discovered\nin this way (Huchra et al. 1985), and Kochanek (1992) predicted approximately one lens per 106 redshifts measured.\nHowever the inclusion of the quasars' light in the calculation of the lens galaxies' magnitudes increases the number\nof lenses by up to an order of magnitude, as illustrated in\nFig. 8. Another possibility is that many lensed quasars enter\n\n\f14\n\nD. J. Mortlock and R. L. Webster\nredshift lenses, and the SDSS about 10. Of course not all\nof these will have Q 2237+0305's wonderful combination of\nsource and deflector properties, but the possibility of even\none similar system is tantalising, to say the least.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMatthew Colless, Paul Hewett and Steve Maddox went beyond the call of duty in answering an endless stream of emails about the the selection of objects into redshift surveys,\nand Michael Drinkwater provided his data prior to publication. DJM was supported by an Australian Postgraduate\nAward.\n\nFigure 12. The normalised distribution of deflector redshifts, zg ,\nof lensed quasars discovered in GRSs. For the 'elliptical' lenses\n(broader curves) the distribution is determined solely by the cosmological model, whereas the extent of the distribution for the\nlenses with bright deflectors increases with the depth of the survey. The two sets of curves for each type of lens show the distributions with mlim = 18 and mlim = 20. For each survey\n\u2206mqg = 2, and results are presented for three cosmological models: \u03a9m0 = 1.0 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.0 (solid lines); \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and\n\u03a9\u039b0 = 0.0 (dashed lines); and \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.7 (dotdashed lines).\n\nGRSs as the quasar images combine to have a high ellipticity, but are also unresolved in the low-resolution (e.g. plate)\ndata from which candidate galaxies are selected. If a significant fraction of such lenses are observed spectroscopically in\nGRSs, more new lenses will be discovered in redshift surveys\nthan are known to date.\nThe number of lenses expected in various existing and\nplanned surveys is given in Table 1. It can be seen that Nl\nvaries greatly with both the form of the PSF of the parent survey and the cosmological model (in the case of the\n'elliptical' lenses), which places fundamental limits on the\naccuracy of these predictions. For instance, the current generation of surveys (with up to \u223c 2 \u00d7 104 galaxies) should\ncontain several lenses between them, but the above uncertainties, combined with shot noise, make this a rather weak\nprediction. Looking ahead, the 2dF GRS (with \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 105\ngalaxies to a limit of mBJ = 19.5) is already well underway, and should contain at least 10 new lenses, and up to\n50 if observational conditions are favourable. Howver, it is\nparticularly sensitive to surface brightness-related selection\neffects, and a more detailed simulation of lensing in the 2dF\nredshift survey is presented in Mortlock & Webster (2000c).\nFinally, the SDSS can be expected to contain over 100 spectroscopic lensed quasars, along with even more discovered\nby more conventional methods.\nMany, and possibly all, of the lenses discovered spectroscopically in redshift surveys, will have deflector galaxies at\nlow redshifts, comparable to the depth of the survey proper.\nThese have the potential to be the most important products\nof such a lens search, as the proximity of the deflector, combined with the information provided by the lensing event,\ncan provide a number of unique insights, as exemplified by\nQ 2237+0305. The 2dF GRS should contain several low-\n\nREFERENCES\nBahcall J. N., Soneira R. M., 1980, ApJS, 44, 73\nBarnes D. G., Webster R. L., Schmidt R. W., Hughes A., 1999,\nMNRAS, 309, 641\nBaugh C.
