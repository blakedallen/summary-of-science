We start with a representation of so(4, 2) by functions on\na realization of the Lobachevski space given by a two sheeted hyperboloid, where the Lie algebra commutators are the usual Poisson-Dirac\nbrackets. Then, introduce a quantized version of the representation\nin which functions are replaced by operators on a Hilbert space and\nPoisson-Dirac brackets by commutators. Eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian are given and \"naive\" ladder operators are identified. The\npreviously defined \"naive\" ladder operators shift the eigenvalues by a\ncomplex number so that an alternative approach is necessary. This\nis obtained by a non self-adjoint function of a linear combination of\nthe ladder operators which gives the correct relation among the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. We give an eigenfunction expansion of\n\n1\n\n\ffunctions over the upper sheet of two sheeted hyperboloid in terms of\nthe eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe notion of the Spectrum Generating Algebra (SGA) was introduced many\nyears ago by Barut and Bohm [1] and independently by Dothan, Gell-Mann\nand Neeman [2] for the construction of multiplets in elementary particle theory. The notion of SGA in quantum mechanics is suitable for the construction\nof the Hilbert space of states for a given system using representation theory.\nThe point of departure is the geometrical symmetry group for a given system.\nThe representations of this algebra give the subspace of the whole Hilbert\nspace of eigenstates corresponding to a fixed energy. Then, we need to add\nsome generators to the algebra so that the new elements, the ladder operators, connect states of different energies. This new generators and hence the\nladder operators cannot commute with the Hamiltonian of the system. Thus,\nthe SGA will generate the whole Hilbert space of eigenfunctions starting from\njust one eigenfunction and following some prescriptions on the application of\nthe operators of the algebra.\nIn a former publication [5], we have discussed the construction of the\nSGA for the free particle in the three dimensional sphere, S 3 , where the\nHamiltonian has a pure discrete spectrum. In that case, the initial space\nisometry algebra or geometrical algebra was so(4), while the SGA that we\nconstructed was isomorphic to so(4, 2).\nThe objective of this paper is to explore the possibility of extending the\nnotion of SGA for systems with purely continuous spectrum. A typically\nnon-trivial example in which this situation arises is in the three dimensional\nLobachevski space. Then, our aim was constructing a SGA for the free particle on a space of negative constant curvature, which can be realized as the\nupper sheet of a two sheeted hyperboloid H3 embedded in the Minkowskian\nspace R3+1 .\nIn this situation, the geometrical algebra is so(3, 1) and we shall show\nthat the SGA is again so(4, 2). However, the situation is quite different\nthan in the previous study case concerning the free motion in S 3 where the\noperator that parameterizes the Hamiltonian is a generator of a compact\nsubgroup of SO(4, 2), while the analogous operator for H3 does not have\nthis property. In the situation under our study, we do not use a maximal\n2\n\n\fcompact subalgebra in order to construct the basis, but instead a subalgebra\nincluding generators of noncompact subgroups. Then, ladder operators can\nbe expected to be functions of generators of the algebra not in so(3, 1).\nOnce we have constructed ladder operators for the free particle in the twosheeted hyperboloid, a somehow unexpected situation emerges: the naive\nchoice for ladder operators that should have served to construct the Hilbert\nspace supporting the representation change the energy by a complex number.\nThis result means that the ladder operators take any vector out of the Hilbert\nspace. This illness has a remedy, which is the construction of a complex power\nof certain linear combinations of ladder operators. This action will solve the\nproblem at the same time that it creates a bridge between quantum theory\nin Lobachevski space and the Gelfand-Graev transformation [6].\nWe have organized this paper as follows: In Section 2, we construct the\ngenerators of the Lie algebra so(4, 2) corresponding to either a free classical\nparticle in a one or two sheeted hyperboloid and give their relations in terms\nof Dirac brackets. In Section 3, we construct the quantized version of the\nmaterial introduced in Section 2 including the restrictive relations necessary\nfor the determination of an irreducible representation of the algebra. We\ndefine the ladder operators and give relations between ladder operators and\nother generators of the algebra. Finally, in Section 4, we restrict our study\nto the three dimensional Lobachevski space realized by one sheet of the two\nsheeted hyperboloid H3 . Here, we obtain a generalization of plane waves for\nthe free particle on the hyperboloid. We find that the previously defined\nladder operators shift the energy of these plane waves by a complex number\nso that a new concept of ladder operators are defined to correct this anomaly.\nThe construction of the SGA for the free particle in H3 is then complete. This\npaper closes in Section 5, showing an eigenfunction expansion of functions\non the two sheeted hyperboloid in terms of generalized pane waves.\n\n2\n\nA classical particle in a three dimensional\nhyperboloid.\n\nWe consider the two sheeted three dimensional hyperboloid H3 immersed\ninto an ambient Minkowskian space R3+1 with equation xi xj gij = (x1 )2 +\n(x2 )2 + (x3 )2 \u2212 (x4 )2 = \u22121, which can be written in the usual shorthand form\nas x2 = xi xi = \u22121. Note that here Latin indices will run from 1 to 4, that\n3\n\n\fthe metric is gij = diag(1, 1, 1, \u22121) and that we have to sum over repeated\nindices from 1 to 4. Henceforth, we shall use the standard convention relative\nto the operations of lowering and raising indices using the metric gij .\nNow, let us consider the Lagrangian of the free particle with mass m = 1\ndefined in the ambient space R3+1 , L := 12 \u1e8bi \u1e8bj gij .\nThen, its restriction to the hyperboloid H3 is given by\n1\nL = \u2212 (\u1e8bi xj \u2212 \u1e8bj xi ) (\u1e8bi xj \u2212 \u1e8bj xi ) ,\n(1)\n4\nwhere the dot means derivative with respect time. The global minus sign\ncomes from the condition xi xi = \u22121 defining H3 .\nThe canonical momenta are determined by\n\u2202L\n= \u2212(xk \u1e8bj \u2212 xj \u1e8bk )xj gik ,\n\u2202 \u1e8bi\nand satisfies the primary constraint\npi :=\n\nxi pi = xi pj gij = 0 .\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nThe Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian (1) gives the canonical\nHamiltonian for the free motion in H3 as:\n1\nH = \u2212 Jij J ij ,\n2\n\nJ ij = xi pj \u2212 xj pi ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere each J ij has the structure of an angular momentum. Our strategy\nto work in H3 will be the following: Instead of dealing in the 8-dimensional\nphase space with dynamical variables xi , pi satisfying the canonical Poisson\nbrackets {xi , pj } = \u03b4ji , we impose the primary constraint (3) and the gauge\nfixing condition\nxi xi = \u22121 .\n(5)\nAccording to the usual procedure [3, 4], we also introduce the Dirac brackets\n{xi , xj }D = 0 ,\n\n{pi , xj }D = \u03b4ij \u2212 xi xj ,\n\n{pi , pj }D = Jij .\n\n(6)\n\nIn the sequel, we prefer to use the variables xi and pi subject to the Dirac\nbrackets (6) instead of defining a set of independent variables in the hyperboloids. Therefore, from now on, as we shall work in the configuration space\nH3 where only Dirac brackets will be appropriate, we suppress the label D,\nsuch as it appears in (6).\n4\n\n\fUsing (6), we obtain:\n{Jij , Jkl } = gij Jkl + gjk Jil \u2212 gik Jjl \u2212 gjl Jik ,\n{Jij , xl } = gjl xi \u2212 gil xj .\n\n(7)\n\nTherefore, the generators Jij span the geometrical symmetry group for the\nhyperboloid, SO(3, 1). Its Casimirs are\nC=\n\n1\nJij J ij ,\n2\n\nand\n\ne = \u01ebijkl Jij Jkl .\nC\n\n(8)\n\n{C, Jik xk } = 2Cxi .\n\n(9)\n\ne = 0 and C coincides up to a sign with\nWith this realization, we have that C\nthe Hamiltonian derived from the above Lagrangian. The fact that we are\nmoving on the hyperboloid is characterized by the constraint condition (3)\nplus the gauge condition (5).\nUsing (7), we can obtain the following commutators:\n{C, xi } = \u22122Jik xk ,\n\nSince H = \u2212C and H is given by\n\u221a formula (49), then we conclude that \u2212C\nis positive, one may denote by \u2212C its unique positive square root. Note\nthat H = \u2212C shows that the Hamiltonian H is positive.\nThen, using the above commutators we obtain the following new ones:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(10)\n{ \u2212C, xi \u2212C} = Jik xk ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n{ \u2212C, Jik \u2212C} =\n\u2212C xi ,\n(11)\n\u221a\n\u221a\n{ \u2212C xi , \u2212C xj } = Jij ,\n(12)\n{Jik xk , Jjl xl } = \u2212Jij ,\n\n(13)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n{ \u2212C xi , Jjk xk } = \u2212 \u2212C gij .\n\n(14)\n\nThen, if we use the following notation:\nMij := Jij ,\n\nM5i :=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212C xi ,\n\nM6i := Jik xk ,\n\nM56 :=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212C ,\n\n(15)\n\nwe note that the {Mab } satisfy the following commutation relations (henceforth, indices a, b will run out from 1 to 6):\n5\n\n\f{Mab , Mcd } = gab Mcd + gbc Mad \u2212 gac Mbd \u2212 gbd Mac ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the metric gab is given by\ngab = diag (1, 1, 1, \u22121, \u22121, 1) .\n\n(17)\n\nObserve that the metric gab has the signature (4, 2). This fact and the explicit form of the commutation relations (16) shows that the {Mab } are the\ngenerators of the algebra so(4, 2).\nIt is also important to remark that in the realization given by (15) the\nfollowing relations hold:\nTab := Mac Mbd g cd = 0\n\nRab := \u01ebabcdef Mcd Mef = 0 ,\n\nand\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u01ebabcdef is the completely antisymmetric tensor. Relations (18) are\ncalled the restrictive relations for this representation of the algebra so(4, 2).\nThese relations do not change under the action of the algebra, since a direct\ncalculation using (16) shows that {Mab } and {Rcd } are so(4, 2) two-tensors.\nThe situation is in complete analogy to the similar problem on S 3 already\nstudied in [5].\n\n3\n\nQuantum SGA\n\nNext, we are going to introduce the quantum version of the previous study.\nIf in Section 2, we have given a representation of the algebra so(4, 2) suitable\nfor a description of the free particle on the hyperboloid H3 , now we proceed\nby giving a representation of this algebra such that its elements are operators\non a Hilbert space. To implement this objective, we transform Dirac brackets\n(16) into commutators, which have the following form:\n[Mab , Mcd ] = \u2212i(gab Mcd + gbc Mad \u2212 gac Mbd \u2212 gbd Mac ) ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere we require the Mab to be Hermitian operators on a suitable Hilbert\nspace. In the sequel, we shall use the following standard notation:\nJij := Mij ,\nKi := M5i ,\n\ni, j = 1, . . . , 4 ,\n\nLi := M6i ,\n6\n\nh := M56 .\n\n(20)\n\n\fIn matrix form, we can write\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nJij Ki Li\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nMab = \uf8ec \u2212Ki 0 h \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u2212Li \u2212h 0\n\ni, j = 1, . . . , 4 .\n\n(21)\n\nCommutation relations (19), along with definitions (20), give explicitly:\n[Jik , Jlm ] = \u2212i(gim Jkl + gkl Jim \u2212 gil Jkm \u2212 gkmJil )\n[Jik , Kl ] = \u2212i(gkl Ki \u2212 gil Kk ),\n\n[Jik , Ll ] = \u2212i(gkl Li \u2212 gil Lk )\n\n[Ki , Kj ] = \u2212[Li , Lj ] = i \u2212 Jij ,\n\n[Ki , Lj ] = igij h\n\n[h, Ki ] = \u2212iLi ,\n\n[h, Li ] = \u2212iKi .\n\n(22)\n\nNote that g55 and g66 have opposite sign. Then, the generator M56 has\nalways hyperbolic character. In consequence, h is a noncompact generator\ncorresponding to hyperbolic rotations. It can be easily shown that\n1\nH = \u2212 Jij J ij = 1 + h2 .\n(23)\n2\nAt this point it is interesting to note that as is well known [7], the spectrum of C = 12 Jij J ij is given by \u22121 + \u03b6 2 , where \u03b6 runs either into the real\ninterval [\u22121, 1] or into the imaginary axis. This shows that the spectrum of\nC is non positive and therefore C \u2264 0. Correspondingly, SO(3, 1) has two\nseries of unitary irreducible representations: the principal series labeled by\nvalues of \u03b6 = i\u03c1 with \u03c1 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) and the supplementary series labeled by\n\u03b6 \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. The spectrum of C has the form \u22121 \u2212 \u03c12 \u2264 \u22121 in the first case\nand \u22121 < \u22121 + \u03b6 2 < 0 in the second.\n\n3.1\n\nRestrictive relations\n\nWe have shown in [5] the importance of the quantum version of the restrictive\nrelations in order to fix the representation of the algebra so(4, 2). These\nrestrictive relations are the symmetrized version of (18) and can be written\n\n7\n\n\fin the following form:\nTab = (Mad Mbe + Mbe Mad )g de + cgab = 0 ,\n\n(24)\n\nRab = \u03b5abcdef (Mcd Mef + Mef Mcd ) = 0 ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere c is a constant to be determined later. In terms of the notation proposed in (20) and (25), Tab = 0 is equivalent to the following set of equations:\nTij = Jik Jjk + Jjk Jik \u2212 (Ki Kj + Kj Ki ) + (Li Lj + Lj Li ) + cgij = 0 ,\n\n(26)\n\nT5i = (hLi + Li h) \u2212 (Jij K j + K j Jij ) = 0 ,\n\n(27)\n\nT6i = hKi + Ki h \u2212 (Jij Lj + Lj Jij ) = 0 ,\n\n(28)\n\nT56 = Ki Li + Li Ki = 0 ,\n\n(29)\n\nT55 = 2(Ki2 + h2 ) \u2212 c = 0 ,\n\n(30)\n\nT66 = 2(L2i \u2212 h2 ) + c = 0 .\n\n(31)\n\nAnalogously, for Rab = 0, we have\nRij = 0 =\u21d2 Ki Lj + Lj Ki \u2212 (Li Kj + Kj Li ) \u2212 2hJij = 0 ,\n\n(32)\n\nR5i = 0 =\u21d2 \u03b5ijkl(Lj Jkl + Jkl Lj ) = 0 ,\n\n(33)\n\nR6i = 0 =\u21d2 \u03b5ijkl(Kj Jkl + Jkl Kj ) = 0 ,\n\n(34)\n\nR56 = 0 =\u21d2 \u03b5ijkl Jij Jkl = 0 .\n\n(35)\n\nThe space H supporting this representation of the algebra so(4, 2) is given\nby the vectors \u03c8 such that Tab \u03c8 = 0 and Rab \u03c8 = 0.\nThe algebra so(4, 2), together with the above restrictive relations, is the\nSGA for the quantum free motion on H3 . In order to justify this terminology,\nwe need to define creation and annihilation operators (although the spectrum\nfor the free particle in our case cannot be expected to be discrete). As we\ndid in the case of the free particle in S 3 [5], a natural choice seems to be\nA\u00b1\ni := Ki \u00b1 Li ,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3, 4 .\n8\n\n(36)\n\n\fSince Ki and Li should be Hermitian so they are A\u00b1\ni . These operators\nsatisfy the following important commutation relations:\ni +\ni \u2212\nA+\n= A\u2212\ni (A )\ni (A ) = 0 ,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3, 4 ,\n\n(37)\n\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n[A+\ni , Aj ] = [Ai , Aj ] = 0 ,\n\ni, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 ,\n\n(38)\n\n\u2212\n[A+\ni , Aj ] = \u22122i(Jij + gij h) ,\n\ni, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 .\n\n(39)\n\nWe write separately the next commutation relations due to their importance:\n+\nhA+\nj = Aj (h \u2212 i) ,\n\n\u2212\nhA\u2212\nj = Aj (h + i) ,\n\nj = 1, 2, 3, 4 ,\n\n(40)\n\nwhere i is here the imaginary unit.\nIn principle, the operators A\u00b1\ni are the naive equivalent of the ladder operators defined for S 3 in [5]. However, this procedure by analogy does not work\nhere. This is due to the appearance of the term i in (40) as we shall see later.\nNote that A\u00b1\ni as well as their real linear combinations belong to the algebra\nof generators of SO(4, 2), so that for any unitary irreducible representation\nof SO(4, 2), real linear combinations of A\u00b1\ni are represented by means of self\nadjoint operators on the Hilbert space supporting this representation.\nNow, we look for quantum operators corresponding to the classical coordinates xi . These operators can now be defined as\n\u2212\nXi := f (h)(A+\ni + Ai )f (h) ,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3, 4 ,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere f (h) is a function of h that we determine by the hypothesis that\n[Xi , Xj ] = 0 and that Xi X i is a c-number (which we shall choose to be \u00b11).\nThese two conditions not only determine f (h), but also the number c in (26)\nthat happens to be c = 2. The function f (h) is\n1 1\nf (h) = \u221a \u221a ,\n2 h\nwhich after (36) and (41) implies that\n\n(42)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n1\n(43)\nXi = \u221a Ki \u221a \u21d0\u21d2 Ki = h Xi h , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 .\nh\nh\nThe conditions we have enforced on Xi correspond to the requirement that\nthey are coordinates of the ambient Lobachevski space xi xi = \u22121 and also\nthat they satisfy the proper gauge condition on the hyperboloid.\n9\n\n\fNow, let us find an interesting relation for Li in terms of Xi , Jik and h.\nFrom (36), it readily follows the first identity in (40) that\n\nhLi + Li h =\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n{h(A+\ng(h)(A+\ni \u2212 Ai ) + (Ai \u2212 Ai )h} =:\ni \u2212 Ai )g(h) , (44)\n2\n2\n\nwhile the second comes from the commutation relations (22) involving h.\nThe function g(h) should be determined from those relations. Equation g(h)\nshould fulfil the equation\ng(h)g(h + i) = 2h + i .\n\n(45)\n\nEquation (45) can be solved after some work and gives as solution:\n\"\n\n\u0393\ng(h) = 2\n\u0393\n\nih\n2\nih\n2\n\n\u0001\n\u0001 #1/2\n+ 43 \u0393 \u2212 ih2 + 43\n\u0001\n\u0001\n+ 41 \u0393 \u2212 ih2 + 41\n\n(46)\n\nDue to the fact that \u0393(z \u2217 ) = \u0393\u2217 (z), where the star denotes complex conjugation, the function g(h) is always positive (we take the principal branch in\nthe square root).\nNow, combining (44), (36) and the restrictive relation (27), we find that\nLi = g \u22121 (h)\n\n\u221a\n\nh (Jik X k + X k Jik )\n\n\u221a\n\nh g \u22121(h) .\n\n(47)\n\nAt this point, we have completed the first task: we have constructed\nall the generators of the SGA as functions of the operators h, Xi and the\ngeometrical generators Jij . In particular Li and Ki are given by formulas\n(43) and (47). In the next section, we shall construct the space of states of\nour system with the help of the SGA.\n\n4\n\nThe quantum free Hamiltonian on H3\n\nHereafter, we shall use the following notation: x2\u03b1 = x21 + x22 + x23 , and \u1e8b\u03b1 x\u03b1 =\n\u1e8b1 x1 + \u1e8b2 x2 + \u1e8b3 x3 . Note that Greek indices \u03b1 and \u03b2 run from 1 to 3 and\nthat for these indices the distinction between upper and lower makesp\nno sense.\nFrom the hyperboloid equations, xi xi = \u22121, we obtain that x4 = x2\u03b1 + 1.\nUsing this chart of coordinates for H13 , we obtain the following new expression\n\n10\n\n\ffor the classical Lagrangian (1),\n1\nL=\n2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(\u1e8b\u03b1 x\u03b1 )2\n2\n\u1e8b\u03b1 \u2212 2\n.\nx\u03b1 + 1\n\n(48)\n\nThis Lagrangian is written in terms of the coordinates x\u03b1 . Its Legendre\ntransformation (with respect to the independent variables x\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3)\ngives the Hamiltonian:\nH=\n\n1 2\n(p\u03b1 + (x\u03b1 p\u03b1 )2 ) ,\n2\n\n(49)\n\nwhere x\u03b1 and p\u03b2 are the classical canonical conjugate coordinates of the\nposition and momentum respectively.\nThen, let us proceed with the quantization of this system.\nFor H3 , the Hilbert space of states will be the space of all Lebesgue\nmeasurable functions on the hyperboloid with a metric which is the restriction\nof the Lebesgue measure on R3+1 to the hyperboloid. This is\n\nh\u03c6|\u03c8i :=\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ni\n\n\u2217\n\nd x \u03b4(xi x + 1) \u03c6 (x) \u03c8(x) =\n\nZ\n\nR3\n\nd3 x\u03b1\n\u221a\n\u03c6(x) \u03c8(x) ,\nx2 + 1\n\n(50)\n\nwhere x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ), \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 .\nCanonical quantization of the classical free Hamiltonian (49) gives us a\nquantum Hamiltonian having the same expression as (49), by replacing x\u03b1\nand p\u03b2 by a pair of canonical conjugate operators for the components of the\nposition X\u03b1 and momentum P\u03b2 respectively. Note that P\u03b1 is not just partial\nderivation with respect to to x\u03b1 multiplied by i, since this operator is not\nHermitian with respect to the scalar product (50). Instead, we should define\nP\u03b1 := (X2 + 1)1/4 (\u2212i\u2202\u03b1 ) (X2 + 1)\u22121/4 ,\n\n(51)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03b1 is the partial derivative with respect to x\u03b1 and X = (X1 , X2 , X3 ).\nThese P\u03b1 together with X\u03b1 (defined as multiplication operators) satisfy the\ncanonical commutation relations [X\u03b1 , P\u03b2 ] = i\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 . Further, we have to remark\nthat the operators Xi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are realizations of the coordinate operators\nin the ambient space defined in the previous subsection since they satisfy the\nsame commutation relations and the same gauge condition xi xi = \u22121. Then,\nwe shall use capital letters to denote these operators Xi in the sequel. From\n11\n\n\fthis expression for the P\u03b1 , we can obtain the Hermitian version of the classical\nHamiltonian (49) as\n1\u221a 2\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 + X\u03b1 X\u03b2\nX + 1 \u2202\u03b1 \u221a\n\u2202\u03b2 ,\n(52)\n2\nX2 + 1\nwhere we sum over the repeated indices \u03b1 and \u03b2 running from 1 to 3.\nOur next goal is to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nH=\u2212\n\nH\u03c8 = \u03bb\u03c8\n\n(53)\n\nassociated to this Hamiltonian. By the form of H in (52), we see that H\ncannot have bound states and that the solutions of H\u03c8 = \u03bb\u03c8 are not expected\nto be normalizable. As the ambient space is R3+1 , we expect these wave\nfunctions to depend on the four dimensional vector xi . We are looking for\nthose special solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (53) which depend on\ni\n\u03b1\nthe\n\u221a four variables\u221axi through the single combination f := ki x = k\u03b1 x \u2212\nx2 + 1 k4 , x4 = x2 + 1 showing that the xi coordinates denote points in\nthe hyperboloid. In terms of this variable f , (53) has the form:\n[f 2 + (k2 \u2212 k42 )] \u03c8 \u2032\u2032 (f ) + 3f \u03c8 \u2032 (f ) = \u2212\u03bb \u03c8(f ) ,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere the primes indicate derivative with respect to f and k2 = k\u03b1 k \u03b1 . The\nsimplest situation in (54) happens when k2 \u2212k42 = 0. In this case, the general\nsolution for (54) is given by\n\u03c8(f ) = C1 f \u22121+\n\n\u221a\n\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\n+ C2 f \u22121\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\n,\n\n(55)\n\nwhere Ci , i = 1, 2 are arbitrary constants. In the general case, ki lie on a\nhyperboloid of the form k2 \u2212 k42 = \u2212m2 (m2 may be positive or negative).\nNow, the general solution has the form\np\np\n(f + f 2 \u2212 m2 )i\u03c1\n(f + f 2 \u2212 m2 )\u2212i\u03c1\np\np\n\u03c8(f ) = C1\n+ C2\n,\n(56)\nf 2 \u2212 m2\nf 2 \u2212 m2\n\nwhere \u03bb = (1 + \u03c12 ). Note that in the limiting case m = 0, this solution is\nequal to (55) that in terms of \u03c1 is\n\u03c8(f ) = C1 f \u22121+i\u03c1 + C2 f \u22121\u2212i\u03c1 .\n\n(57)\n\nWe shall use this notation in the sequel. It is important to insist that the\nparameter which appears in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is \u03bb. For each fixed\n12\n\n\fvalue of \u03bb, there exists two linearly independent solutions as shown in (57).\nThe relation between \u03bb and \u03c1 is given by \u03bb = (1 + \u03c12 ) as given before. On the\nother hand, we may look at \u03c1 as the basic parameter. Then, there is a unique\nsolution for each \u03c1 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) given by (with ki in the cone k2 \u2212 k42 = 0):\n\u03c8(f ) = \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) = (x\u03b1 k\u03b1 \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\nx2 + 1 k4 )\u22121+i\u03c1 .\n\n(58)\n\nThen, we have obtained solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with Hamiltonian (52) labeled by k\u03b1 and \u03c1, which play the same role than the components\nof the momentum for the standard Euclidean plane waves \u03c6(x, p) = eix*p .\nNext, let us consider the quantized version of the components of the\nantisymmetric tensor Jij , i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4. We have\nJ\u03b1\u03b2 = X\u03b1 P\u03b2 \u2212 X\u03b2 P\u03b1 ,\n\nJ4\u03b1 =\n\n\u221a\n\nX 2 + 1 P\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3 .\n\n(59)\n\nThe components Jij satisfy the commutation relations for the generators of\nSO(3, 1). We also can readily show that the relation between the quantum\nanalog of Hamiltonian (49) and Jij is given by\n1\nwith\nh = M56 .\n(60)\nH = \u2212 Jij J ij = 1 + h2 ,\n2\nThen, it is clear after (53) and (60) that h\u03c8(f ) = \u03c1\u03c8(f ). In order to\nobtain the action of Li and\u221aKi , we shall use an operator with four components\nTi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4. If X4 := X2 + 1, let us define Ti by\nTi := Jij X j + X j Jij ,\nthen,\n\n\u221a\nT4 = i X2 + 1 (2X\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 + 3) ,\n\nT\u03b1 = i(X\u03b1 (2X\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 + 3) + 2\u2202\u03b1 ) ,\n\n(61)\n(62)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3 and we sum over repeated indices. These four operators\nare Hermitian with respect to the scalar product (50) and so is the operator\nTi k i , where we define the components k i as above. This is\nTi k i = i(Xi k i (2X\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 + 3) + 2k\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 ) .\n\n(63)\n\nThe action (63) on the wave functions (58) is\n\u221a\n[Ti k i ] \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) = [Ti k i ] (x\u03b1 k\u03b1 \u2212 x2 + 1 k4 )\u22121+i\u03c1 [Ti k i ] (xi k i )\u22121+i\u03c1\n= \u2212(2\u03c1 \u2212 i)(xi k i )i\u03c1 = \u2212(2\u03c1 \u2212 i)(xi k i )\u22121+i(\u03c1\u2212i) = \u2212(2\u03c1 \u2212 i)\u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1 \u2212 i) .\n(64)\n13\n\n\fAs we can see from (64), the action of the operator Ti k i on \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) shifts\n\u03c1 by \u2212i.\nThe action of other operators on the wave functions \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) can also\nbe given. For instance, take expression (47) for the operators Li , which now\ncan be defined with the new Jij and have the same commutation relations\nthan those in the previous section (and therefore they should be identified).\nWe obtain:\n[Li k i ] \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) = [Li k i ] (xi k i )\u22121+i\u03c1\np\n= \u2212 \u03c1(\u03c1 \u2212 i)(g(\u03c1)g(\u03c1 \u2212 i))\u22121 [ti k i ] (xi k i )\u22121+i\u03c1\n\np\n= \u2212 \u03c1(\u03c1 \u2212 i)(g(\u03c1)g(\u03c1 \u2212 i))\u22121 (2\u03c1 \u2212 i)(xi k i )i\u03c1 , (65)\n\nwhere g(\u03c1) has been given in (46) and therefore satisfies relation (45). Then,\nif we apply (45) into (65), we finally get:\n[Li k i ]\u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1, \u03c1) = [Li k i ] (xi k i )\u22121+i\u03c1\np\np\n= \u2212 \u03c1(\u03c1 \u2212 i)(xi k i )i\u03c1 = \u2212 \u03c1(\u03c1 \u2212 i)\u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1 \u2212 i) .\n\n(66)\n\np\n\n(67)\n\nFollowing similar procedures, we can obtain the action of the operator\nKi k i with Ki as in (43) into \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1). This gives:\n[Ki k i ] \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) =\n\n\u03c1(\u03c1 \u2212 i) \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1 \u2212 i) .\n\ni\nFrom relations (36), we can determine the action of A\u00b1\ni k into \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1).\nThis is\n\ni\ni\nA\u2212\ni k \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) = (Ki + Li )k \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) = 0 ,(68)\n\np\ni\ni\nA+\n\u03c1(\u03c1 \u2212 i) \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1 \u2212 i) .(69)\nk\n\u03c8(x\n,\nk\n,\n\u03c1)\n=\n(K\n\u2212\nL\n)k\n\u03c8(x\n,\nk\n,\n\u03c1)\n=\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\ni\ni\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\ni\n\nWe discuss the consequences of (69) in the next subsection.\n\n14\n\n\f4.1\n\nThe ladder operators\n\nLet us go back to equation (40). Assume that \u03c8 is an eigenvector of h,\n+\n+\n+\nh\u03c8 = \u03c1\u03c8. Then, (40) gives h(A+\ni \u03c8) = Ai (h \u2212 i)\u03c8 = (\u03c1 \u2212 i)(Ai \u03c8). Since Ai\n+ i\n+\n+ i\nis Hermitian (and so is Ai k ), this shows that Ai \u03c8 (and also Ai k \u03c8) is not\n\u2212 i\nin the domain of h. Same happens with A\u2212\ni \u03c8 and Ai k \u03c8. Therefore, it is not\npossible in principle to use A\u00b1\ni as the ladder operators for the eigenvectors\nof h. This is related to the fact that the spectrum of h is continuous.\nFortunately, this is not the end of the story. In order to find a clue on\nhow to proceed, let us analyze the simplest case of SO(2, 1). Its Lie algebra\nso(2, 1) has generators l0 , l1 and l2 with commutation relations\n[l1 , l2 ] = \u2212il0 ,\n\n[l0 , l1 ] = il2 ,\n\n[l0 , l2 ] = \u2212il1 .\n\n(70)\n\nThe algebra so(2, 1) has a generator of a compact subgroup which is l0\n(sometimes, generators of compact subgroups are denoted as compact generators, which does not mean that they are compact in the ordinary sense\nof compact operators on Banach spaces). In order to construct a unitary\nirreducible representation of SO(2, 1), we may use the subspace spanned by\nthe eigenvectors of l0 . We may write\nl0 |mi = m|mi ,\n\n(71)\n\nwhere we have labeled as m the eigenvalues of l0 for convenience. Ladder\noperators can be defined in this case as A\u00b1 = l1 \u00b1 il2 , so that\nA\u00b1 |mi = a\u00b1 (m)|m \u00b1 1i ,\n\n(72)\n\nl1 |\u03bbi = \u03bb|\u03bbi .\n\n(73)\n\nwhere the coefficients a\u00b1 (m) should be determined by using commutation\nrelations (70) and unitarity conditions for the elements of SO(3, 1).\nThis is a standard procedure, but it would be interesting to investigate\nwhat would happen if instead of l0 we had insisted in building the same\nconstruction with a noncompact operator, say l1 . If the real number \u03bb is in\nthe continuous spectrum of l1 with generalized eigenvector |\u03bbi [8], we have\nCommutation relations (70) trivially give\n[l1 , l0 \u00b1 l2 ] = \u2213i(l0 \u00b1 l2 ) ,\n15\n\n(74)\n\n\fwhich implies that the vector given by\ne := (l0 + l2 )|\u03bbi\n|\u03bbi\n\n(75)\n\ne = (\u03bb \u2212 i)|\u03bbi\ne .\nl1 |\u03bbi\n\n(76)\n\ni \u2212iu\ni \u2212iu\n(h \u2212 u) .\n= (A+\nh(A+\ni k )\ni k )\n\n(77)\n\nshould be an (generalized) eigenvector of l1 with eigenvalue \u03bb \u2212 i:\nThis shows that the subspace spanned by the generalized eigenvectors1 |\u03bbi\nof l1 , with \u03bb in the spectrum of l1 , cannot support a unitary representation\nfor SO(2, 1). This problem was already discussed in the literature [11]. We\nshall introduce here another point of view.\nThis new point of view is the essential point in the construction of a SGA\nfor a Hamiltonian with continuous spectrum and we introduce it as follows:\n\u00b1 i\nAccording to (36) operators A\u00b1\ni are Hermitian and so are Ai k . There2\nfore, a measurable function of a self adjoint version of A\u00b1\ni is well defined\naccording to the spectral representation theorem. Our goal is to find a worki \u2212iu\nable expression for (A\u00b1\nwith u real and to show that\ni k )\n\nIn order to prove this formula, let us note that as a straightforward consequence of (40) is that\ni n\n+ i n\nh(A+\ni k ) = (Ai k ) (h \u2212 in) .\n\n(78)\n\nThen, for any complex number z one has\ni\n+ i\n+ i\nh exp{\u2212z(A+\ni k )} = exp{\u2212z(Ai k )}(h + iz(Ai k )) ,\n\n(79)\n\nwhenever the exponential be correctly defined. As a matter of fact, the\nexponential in (79) is not always defined and it should be considered as an\nabbreviate form of writing the formal series\n1\n\nRoughly speaking,\nthe vectors \u03c8 of this space should admit a span in terms of the |\u03bbi\nR\nin the form \u03c8 = h\u03bb|\u03c8i|\u03bbi d\u03bc(\u03bb). Details in [8].\n2\nIf we use a unitary irreducible representation of SO(4, 2), the elements of the Lie\ni\nalgebra so(4, 2) are represented by self adjoint operators [9] and therefore A\u00b1\ni k can be\n\u00b1 i \u2212iu\nrepresented by self adjoint operators so that (Ai k )\ncan be well defined via spectral\ntheory [10] with a proper choice of a branch for the logarithm.\n\n16\n\n\f\u221e\nX\n(A+ k i )l\ni\n\nl!\n\nl=1\n\n(80)\n\n.\n\nIn order to prove (77), we shall make use of the following integral representation [12]:\nZ \u221e\nz \u22121+iu \u2212z\u03bc\ndz\ne\n= \u03bc\u2212iu ,\n(81)\n\u0393(iu)\n0\n\ni\nwhere u is a real number. Now replace \u03bc by A+\ni k in the above expression\nand multiply the resulting formal expression by h to the left. After (81) this\ngives:\n\nh\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n=\n\nz \u22121+iu \u2212z\u03bc\ndz\ne\n=\n\u0393(iu)\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndz\n\n0\n\nz \u22121+iu \u2212z\u03bc\ndz\ne h+\n\u0393(iu)\n\nZ\n\nz \u22121+iu \u2212z\u03bc\ne (h + i\u03bcz)\n\u0393(iu)\n\u221e\n\ndz\n\n0\n\nz \u22121+iu \u2212z\u03bc\ne i\u03bcz .\n\u0393(iu)\n\nAgain, we use (81) in the last term of (82):\nZ \u221e\n\u0393(iu + 1)\nz \u22121+iu \u2212z\u03bc\ne i\u03bcz = i\u03bc\u03bc\u22121\u2212iu\n= \u2212u\u03bc\u2212iu .\ndz\n\u0393(iu)\n\u0393(iu)\n0\n\n(82)\n\n(83)\n\nFrom there, we readily obtain the commutation relations (77). If we recall\nthat h \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) = \u03c1 \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1, \u03c1), it becomes obvious that\ni \u2212iu\ni \u2212iu\nh [(A+\n\u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1)] = (\u03c1 \u2212 u) (A+\n\u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) ,\ni k )\ni k )\n\n(84)\n\ni \u2212iu\n[(A+\n\u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1)] = g(u, \u03c1) \u03c8(x\u03b1, k\u03b1 , \u03c1 \u2212 u) .\ni k )\n\n(85)\n\ni \u2212iu\nso that (A+\n\u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1) is an eigenfunction of h with eigenvalue \u03c1 \u2212 u.\ni k )\nTherefore, it must exist a constant depending on u and \u03c1, g(u, \u03c1) such that\n\nThe function g(u, \u03c1) satisfies the following properties\ng(0, \u03c1) = 0 ,\n\ng(i, \u03c1) = 2\n\np\n\n\u03c1(\u03c1 \u2212 i) ,\n\n(86)\n\nwhere the first relation in (86) is obvious and the second come from (69).\nThese relations will be useful in order to find the final expression for g(u, \u03c1).\nAnother property for g(u, \u03c1) can be obtained from\n17\n\n\fi \u2212iv\u2212iu\n(A+\n\u03c8(xi , ki , \u03c1) = g(u + v) \u03c8(xi , ki , \u03c1 \u2212 u \u2212 v) ,\ni k )\ni \u2212iv\u2212iu\ni \u2212iv\ni \u2212iu\n(A+\n\u03c8(xi , ki , \u03c1) = (A+\n(A+\n\u03c8(xi , ki , \u03c1)\ni k )\ni k )\ni k )\ni \u2212iv\n= g(u, \u03c1) (A+\n\u03c8(xi , ki , \u03c1 \u2212 u) = g(u, \u03c1) g(v, \u03c1 \u2212 u) \u03c8(xi , ki , \u03c1 \u2212 u \u2212 v) .(87)\ni k )\n\nThese identities show the following functional identity for g(u, \u03c1):\ng(u, \u03c1) g(v, \u03c1 \u2212 u) = g(u + v, \u03c1) ,\n\n(88)\n\nwhich has the following solution:\n\u0014\n\ng(u, \u03c1) = 2\n\n\u2212iu \u22122iu\n\ni\n\n\u0393(\u2212i\u03c1)\u0393(1 \u2212 i\u03c1)\n\u0393(\u2212i(\u03c1 \u2212 u))\u0393(1 \u2212 i(\u03c1 \u2212 u))\n\n\u0015 12\n\n.\n\n(89)\n\nThis completes the discussion on the construction of the ladder operators and their action on the hyperboloid plane waves \u03c8(x\u03b1 , k\u03b1 , \u03c1). In the\nnext section, we shall discuss an interesting formula giving an eigenfunction\nexpansion of functions over H13 .\n\n5\n\nGeneral properties of the eigenfunctions of\nthe Hamiltonian\n\nHere, we start with an infinitely differentiable function f (xi ) on the hyperboloid H13 , with equation xi xi = \u22121. The function f (xi ) can be transformed\ninto the function h(ki ) on the cone ki k i = 0 by means of the following integral:\nZ\ni\nh(k ) = Dx f (xi ) \u03b4(xi k i \u2212 1) ,\n(90)\nwhere Dx represents here the invariant measure on the hyperboloid (or equivalently the restriction of the Lebesgue measure on the hyperboloid):\nDx =\n\nd3 x\u03b1\nd3 x\u03b1\n=p\n,\nx4\nx2\u03b1 + 1\n\n\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 .\n\n(91)\n\nThe integral (90) for functions f (xi ) on the hyperboloid gives a function\non the cone. This type of transformation has been considered by Gelfand\n18\n\n\fand Graev [6] and holds their name (Gelfand-Graev transformation). This\nGelfand-Graev transform has an inverse which is given by\nZ\n1\nf (xi ) = \u2212 2 Dk h(k i ) \u03b4 \u2032\u2032(xi k i \u2212 1) ,\n(92)\n8\u03c0\nwhere Dk is the measure on the cone given by\nd 3 k\u03b1\n.\n(93)\nk4\nThen, let us consider the Mellin transform of the function h(k i ), which is\ndefined as:\nZ \u221e\ni\n\u03c6(k , \u03c1) =\ndt h(tk i ) t\u2212i\u03c1 .\n(94)\nDk =\n\n0\n\nThis Mellin transform has the following inversion formula:\nZ \u221e\n1\ni\nd\u03c1 \u03c6(k i , \u03c1) .\nh(k ) =\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\n(95)\n\nIf we replace in (94) the expression (90) for h(k i ), we find\ni\n\n\u03c6(k , \u03c1) =\n=\n\nZ\n\nDx f (xi )\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ni\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u2212i\u03c1\n\ndt \u03b4(xi k t \u2212 1) t\n\nDx f (xi ) \u03b4(xi k i t \u2212 1) t\u2212i\u03c1\n=\n\nZ\n\nDxf (xi )(xi k i )\u22121+i\u03c1 .\n\n(96)\n\nEquation (96) shows that \u03c6(k i , \u03bd) is an homogenous function on the cone\nof degree \u22121 + i\u03c1 and therefore it can be defined by its values on any contour\nwhich crosses all generatrices of the cone. Equation (96) can be looked as\na generalization of the Fourier transform of the function f (xi ) with respect\nto the integral kernel {(xi k i )\u22121+i\u03c1 }. In fact this integral kernel is formed\nup to plane waves in the same way that the standard Fourier transform has\nas integral kernel the Euclidean plane waves ei(x*p) . Then, we can find the\ninverse transformation of (96) by entering (95) into (92). The result is given\nunder the form of the following integral:\nZ\nZ \u221e\n1\nf (xi ) = \u2212\nDk\nd\u03c1 \u03c6(k i , \u03c1) \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 (xi k i \u2212 1) .\n(97)\n16\u03c0 3\n\u2212\u221e\n19\n\n\fWe can rewrite the right hand side of (97) in the following form:\n1\nf (xi ) = \u2212\n16\u03c0 3\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\n\nZ\n\nDk\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c1 \u03c6(k i , \u03c1) \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 (xi k i \u2212 t) \u03b4(t \u2212 1) .\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(98)\n\nAfter integrating by parts twice with respect to the variable t, we obtain:\n1\nf (xi ) = \u2212\n16\u03c0 3\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\ndt \u03b4 (t \u2212 1)\n\nZ\n\nDk\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c1 \u03c6(k i , \u03c1) \u03b4(xi k i \u2212 t) .\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(99)\n\nNow, let us make the change of variables given by k i 7\u2212\u2192 tkei in the integrand\nof (99).

We may wonder on whether it is also an analogue of the\nPlancherel formula in this case. Let us consider the following parametrization\nfor the four vector with components k i :\nk i = \u03c9N i = (n, 1)\u03c9 ,\n\nn2 = 1 ,\n\n(102)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = k 4 . We use \u03c9 in order to get rid of the index. In this parametrization, the measure Dk has the following form:\nDk = \u03c9 d\u03c9 dn ,\n20\n\n(103)\n\n\fwhere dn is the restriction of the Lebesgue measure in the three dimensional\nsphere. Using the fact that the function \u03c6(ki , \u03c1) is homogenous of the degree\n\u22121 + i\u03c1, we can derive the following expression:\n1\nf (xi ) =\n16\u03c0 3\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\n\nd\u03c1 \u03c1\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9 d\u03c9 dn \u03c6(Ni , \u03c1) \u03c9 \u22121+i\u03c1 \u03b4(xi N i \u03c9 \u2212 1) .\n\nIf we integrate (104) with respect to \u03c9, one obtains\nZ \u221e\nZ\n1\n2\ndn \u03c6(Ni , \u03c1)(xi N i )\u22121\u2212i\u03c1 .\nd\u03c1 \u03c1\nf (xi ) =\n3\n16\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\n(104)\n\n(105)\n\nRelation (105) gives the inverse Fourier transform of f (xi ) in terms of\nthe eigenfunctions (xi N i )\u22121\u2212i\u03c1 of the Hamiltonian, i.e., what we have called\nthe hyperbolic plane waves or Shapiro waves [13, 14]. For real \u03c1, the set of\nfunctions (xi N i )\u22121\u2212i\u03c1 realize a unitary representation for the principal series\nof SO(3, 1).\n\n6\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe have investigated the possibility of constructing Spectrum Generating Algebras (SGA) for quantum systems showing a purely continuous spectrum.\nIn fact, we have obtained a SGA for the free particle in the three dimensional\ntwo sheeted hyperboloid H3 . We have done this in two steps. First of all,\nwe have obtained a representation of the Lie algebra so(4, 2), by functions of\ncoordinates and momenta, suitable for the description of a classical particle\non an one or two sheeted hyperboloid. We have obtained the Dirac-Poisson\nbrackets for the generators of the algebra. In the second step, we have obtained another representation of so(4, 2) in which functions are replaced by\noperators and Dirac brackets by commutators. Following a usual procedure,\nwe construct ladder operators as Hermitian members of the algebra so(4, 2).\nWe have found the solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in H3 equivalent\nto the plane waves in the space R3 . As solutions of a time independent\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, these plane waves are eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian,\nso that they can be labeled by their energies. Instead, we prefer to label\nthem by the eigenvalues of a related operator h as given in (60), which is one\nof the generators of the algebra. We denote by \u03c1 to the eigenvalues of h.\n\n21\n\n\fWe observe that the ladder operators shift the variable \u03c1 in these solutions\nby a complex number. This may happen because our generalized plane waves\nare out of the Hilbert space. In order to avoid this inconvenience, we have\nintroduce some operators which are functions of suitable linear combinations\nof the ladder operators. These operators are not self adjoint but produce real\nshifts on the label \u03c1 of the generalized plane waves and can be used as a new\nform of ladder operators for the continuous spectrum.\nFinally, we have discussed a generalized Fourier transform between functions on the three dimensional hyperboloid and functions over a three dimensional cone. This is intimately related to the transformation defined by\nGraev and Gelfand in [6]. A Plancherel type theorem is valid in this context.\nWe have given an eigenfunction expansion of functions over the hyperboloid\nin terms of the generalized plane waves on the hyperboloid.\n\nAcknowledgements\nPartial financial support is indebt to the Ministry of Science (Project MTM200910751 and FIS2009-09002), and to the Russian Science Foundation (Grants\n10-01-00300).\n\nReferences\n[1] A.O.
