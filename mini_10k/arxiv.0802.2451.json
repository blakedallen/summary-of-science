For a general discrete\nnoiseless channel allowing non-integer valued symbol weights, it\nis shown that the capacity-if well-defined-can be determined\nfrom the radius of convergence of its generating function, from\nthe smallest positive pole of its generating function, or from the\nrightmost real singularity of its complex generating function.\nA generalisation is given for Pringsheim's Theorem and for\nthe Exponential Growth Formula to generating functions of\ncombinatorial structures with non-integer valued symbol weights.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\n\nwhich will turn out to be a restriction on the set of possible\nstring weights.\nThis allows us then to represent the combinatorial complexity of a DNC by a generating function with a well-defined\nradius of convergence and we use analytical methods to derive\nthe capacity. In this sense, our work is a generalisation of [3].\nPerhaps more important, in many cases that could be treated by\nthe techniques proposed in [3], it is much simpler to construct\nthe generating function of the considered DNC and to use our\nresults to derive the capacity. We give two simple examples\nthat may serve as illustrations. In this sense, our work can also\nbe considered as an interesting alternative to [3].\n\nWhen modelling digital communication systems, there are\nII.

An follows.\nexample is the runlength-limited constraint in magnetic recording [1]. We consider in this paper the discrete noiseless channel Definition 1. A DNC A = (A, w) consists of a countable\n(DNC) as introduced by Shannon [2]. A DNC is specified by set A of strings accepted by\u2295 the \u2295channel and an associated\na set of constraints imposed on strings over a certain alphabet, weight function w : A 7\u2192 R (R denotes the nonnegative\nand only those strings that fulfil the constraints are allowed real numbers) with the following property.

Depending on the system we want to\nDefinition 2. Let A = (A, w) represent a DNC.

We then ask the following question. What\nGA (y) =\ny w(s)\ny \u2208 R.\n(2)\nis the maximum rate of data per string weight that can be\ns\u2208A\ntransmitted over a DNC?\nWe order and index the set of possible string weights w(A)\nThis question was first answered by Shannon in [2]. In [3],\nsuch\nthat w(A) = {wk }\u221e\nk=1 with w1 < w2 < * * * . We can\nthe authors extend Shannon's results to DNCs with non-integer\nthen\nwrite\nvalued symbol weights. In both [2] and [3], the authors use\n\u221e\nX\nthe following approach to derive the capacity of a DNC. They\n(3)\nG\n(y)\n=\nN [wk ]y wk\nA\nrestrict the class of considered DNCs to those that allow the\nk=1\ntransmission of a set of strings forming a regular language.\nThe regularity allows then to represent the DNC by a finite where for each k \u2208 N, the coefficient N [wk ] is equal to the\nstate machine and results from matrix theory are applied to number of distinct strings of weight wk . Since the coefficients\nN [wk ] result from an enumeration, they are all nonnegative.\nderive the capacity of the DNC.\nOur approach is different in the following sense. We con- Note that for any DNC A, we have GA (0) = N [0] = 1 since\nsider general DNCs with the only restriction that the capacity every DNC allows the transmission of the empty string and\nas defined in [2] and generalised in [3] has to be well-defined, since there is only one empty string.\n\n\fThe maximum rate of data per string weight that can be\ntransmitted over a DNC is given by its capacity. We define\ncapacity in accordance with [2] and [3] as follows.\nDefinition 3. The capacity C of a DNC A = (A, w) is given\nby\n\nProof of Lemma 1: We define M [k] = N 1/wk [wk ] and\nwrite GA (y) as\nGA (y) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nM [k]y\n\n\u0001wk\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nk=1\n\nWe define the two sets D(y) and E(y) as\n\b\nk\u2192\u221e\nD(y) = k \u2208 N M [k]y < 1\n(8)\n\b\nin nats per symbol weight. This is equivalent to the following.\nE(y) = N \\ D(y) = k \u2208 N M [k]y \u2265 1\n(9)\nFor all \u01eb with C > \u01eb > 0, the following two properties hold.\n1) The number N [wk ] is greater than or equal to ewk (C\u2212\u01eb) and write\nX\nX\n\u0001w\n\u0001w\ninfinitely often (i.o.) with respect to k.\nM [l]y l .\n(10)\nM [k]y k +\nGA (y) =\nwk (C+\u01eb)\n2) The number N [wk ] is less than or equal to e\nl\u2208E(y)\nk\u2208D(y)\nalmost everywhere (a.e.) with respect to k.\nWe assume in the following that the number sequence It follows from Lemma 2 that GA (y) converges iff the set\nE(y) is finite. The number R is the radius of convergence\n{wk }\u221e\nk=1 is not too dense in the sense that for any integer\nof GA (y), therefore, for any \u03b4 > 1, the set E(R/\u03b4) is finite.\nn\u22650\nSince D(y) = N\\E(y), the finiteness of E(R/\u03b4) is equivalent\nmax k \u2264 LnK\n(5) to\nC = lim sup\n\nln N [wk ]\nwk\n\n(4)\n\nwk <n\n\nfor some constant L \u2265 0 and some constant K \u2265 0. Otherwise,\nthe number of possible string weights in the interval [n, n + 1]\nincreases exponentially with n. In this case, Definition 3 does\nnot apply. We present in the following example a case where\ncapacity is not well-defined.\n\nk \u2208 D(R/\u03b4)\n\na.e.\n\n(11)\n\nWe define \u01eb = ln \u03b4. Equation (11) is then equivalent to\nN [wk ] < ewk (\u2212 ln R+\u01eb)\n\na.e.\n\n(12)\n\nExample 1. Let N [wk ] denote the coefficients of the generat- which implies\ning function of some DNC.

According to Definition 3, the capacity of\nthe DNC is then equal to zero because of ln N [wk ] = 0 for\nall k \u2208 N. However, the channel accepts Rn distinct strings\nof weight smaller than n. The average amount of data per\nstring weight that we can transmit over the channel is thus\nlower-bounded by ln Rn /n = ln R, which is according to the\nassumption greater than zero.\n\u22b3\nWhenever we say that the capacity of a DNC is well-defined,\nwe mean that (5) is fulfilled.\nIII. C APACITY\n\nBY\n\nR ADIUS\n\nOF\n\nAgain since R is the radius of convergence of GA (y), for any\n\u03b4 > 1, the set E(R\u03b4) is infinite.

We therefore have C = \u2212 ln R.\nIn the following example, we show how Lemma 1 applies\nin practice. We denote by A \u222a B the union of the two sets\nA and B, we denote by AB the set of all concatenations ab\nwith a \u2208 A and b \u2208 B, and we denote by S \u22c6 the Kleene star\noperation on S, which is defined as S \u22c6 = \u01eb \u222a S \u222a SS \u222a * * * .\n\nC ONVERGENCE\n\nExample 2.

The capacity of A is then given by It states that the set of binary strings that do not contain a\ncertain pattern p has the generating function\nC = Q.\nProof: Since FA (e\u2212s ) has its rightmost real singularity in\ns = Q, it follows from Theorem 1 that the r.o.c. of FA (e\u2212s )\n\nf (y) =\n\nyk\n\nc(y)\n+ (1 \u2212 2y)c(y)\n\n(26)\n\n\fwhere k is the length (in bits) of p and where c(y) is\nautoPthe\nk\u22121\ncorrelation polynomial of p.

C ONCLUSIONS\nFor a general DNC, we identified the capacity with the\ncharacteristics of its generating function, namely the radius\nof convergence of its generating function, the rightmost real\nsingularity of its complex generating function, and the smallest positive pole of its generating function. We generalised\nPringsheim's Theorem and the Exponential Growth Formula\nas given in [6] to generating functions that allow non-integer\nvalued symbol weights.\nRepresenting a DNC by its generating function and not by\na finite state machine has an additional advantage. Although\nthe finite state machine allows the derivation of the correct\ncapacity of the DNC, it says nothing about the exact number\nof valid strings of weight w. The generating function of a DNC\nprovides this information. The coefficients N [wk ] are equal to\nthe number of distinct strings of length wk that are accepted\nby the DNC. The coefficients can either be calculated by an\n\nalgebraic expansion of the generating function or they can be\napproximated by means of analytic asymptotics as discussed\nfor integer valued symbol weights in [6]. In [7], the analytic\napproach is extended to generating functions of DNCs with\nnon-integer valued symbol weights.\nFor a regular DNC fulfilling some further restrictions, the\nauthors in [3] define a Markov process that generates valid\nstrings at an entropy rate equal to the capacity of the channel.\nBased on generating functions as introduced in this paper, it\nis shown in [7] that for a general DNC, any entropy rate C \u2032\nsmaller than the capacity C is achievable in the sense that\nthere exists a random process that generates strings that are\ntransmitted over the channel at an entropy rate C \u2032 .\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nV.
