Our results for the vector\nchannel are rather robust and well within the reach of present-day colliders, while the\naxial channel is more loosely constrained.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nUp to the present date, the physical mechanism underlying electroweak symmetry breaking\n(EWSB) still remains unknown. Its simplest description in terms of a fundamental standard\nmodel (SM) scalar Higgs doublet is certainly appealing but not fully satisfactory from a theoretical standpoint. A single Higgs doublet makes the electroweak interactions renormalizable and,\nif light enough (mH \u223c 100 GeV), all the electroweak precision tests (EWPT) can be successfully\naccounted for [1] (see Fig. 1). However, mH is unstable under quantum corrections: at short distances it diverges quadratically and thus makes the SM description problematic. One is therefore\nled to consider alternative mechanisms of EWSB, either with Higgs bosons (e.g. supersymmetry)\nor without them (Higgsless theories).\nIn Higgsless models the Higgs boson is often replaced by one or more spin-1 bosons. The theory\nis then no longer renormalizable, but perturbative unitarity\ncan still be preserved up to a few TeV,\n\u221a\none order of magnitude above the Fermi scale, v = ( 2GF )\u22121/2 ' 246 GeV, so that meaningful\ncomparisons with current experiments can be made. The ultraviolet completion of the theory will\ndepend on the underlying Higgsless model, be it technicolor, deconstructed models with hiddengauge symmetry or holographic realizations, but at low energies they all should be described in\n\n1\n\n\fU=0, mt =173GeV\n0.4\n\n99%\n95%\n68%\n\n0.2\n\n120\n\nT\n\n0.0\n\n250\n-0.2\n\n500\n1000\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n-0.3\n\n2000\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nS\n\nFigure 1:\n\nIR logarithmic contributions to S and T for a cut-off scale \u039b in the range 115 \u2212 3000 GeV. The\nexperimentally allowed region and the SM reference point at which all ST U parameters vanish is chosen as in\nRef. [1] (in particular with mt = 175GeV and mH = 150GeV). The constraint U = 0 is always imposed.

Obviously, depending\non the specific Higgsless model one considers there will be different relations amongst the couplings.\nIn this paper we will instead pursue a more phenomenological approach, following [4], and consider\na generic Higgsless model whose parameters will be constrained only by unitarity and electroweak\nprecision observables (S and T ) up to the one-loop level. The main advantage of this approach is\nthat one can test the viability of Higgsless models based on spin-1 bosons as model-independently\nas possible (and potentially rule out some of the existing models). Additionally, one can extract\ninformation on the spin-1 bosons which can then be tested at colliders.\nOblique corrections to electroweak precision observables (EWPO) can be conveniently expressed in terms of the SM gauge boson vacuum polarization correlators, defined as\n1\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd 2\n2\n3\n3 \u03bc\u03bd 2\n+ \u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\u2212\nLvac\u2212pol = \u2212 W\u03bc3 \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n33 (q )W\u03bd \u2212 B\u03bc \u03a000 (q )B\u03bd \u2212 W\u03bc \u03a030 (q )B\u03bd \u2212 W\u03bc \u03a0W W (q )W\u03bd ,\n2\n2\nwhere the (transverse) correlators can be decomposed as\n\u0012 \u03bc \u03bd\n\u0013\nq q\n\u03bc\u03bd 2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a0ij (q ) =\n\u2212g\n\u03a0ij (q 2 ) .\n2\nq\nOne defines the \u015c \u2261 \u03b1S/4 sin2 \u03b8W parameter as the oblique contribution\n\u0012 \u0013\ng\n\u015c =\n\u03a0030 (0)\ng0\n2\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\fand the T\u0302 \u2261 \u03b1T parameter as\nT\u0302 =\n\n\u03a033 (0) \u2212 \u03a0W W (0)\n,\nm2W\n\n(4)\n\ni.e., proportional to \u03c1 \u2212 1 and therefore a measure of custodial symmetry breaking.\nIn the Standard Model, S and T receive contributions only at one-loop level (shown in Fig. 1).\nTheir expressions are, in terms of the effective cut-off scale \u039b,\ng2\n\u039b2\n,\nlog\n192\u03c0 2\nm2W\n3\u03b1\n\u039b2\n= \u2212\nlog\n.\n16\u03c0c2W\nm2W\n\n\u2206\u015cIR =\n\n(5a)\n\n\u2206T\u0302IR\n\n(5b)\n\nResidual finite terms are fixed by matching \u2206\u015c and \u2206T\u0302 to the SM reference point chosen in\nRef. [1] (with mt = 175GeV and mH = 150GeV), correcting for the most recent top mass value\nmt = 172GeV and identifying the leading mH logarithmic dependence with that of \u039b.\nThe starting point of the EWPO analysis in Higgsless models is the correlation between S and\nT . Fixing the cutoff \u039b at the TeV scale, the main challenge of Higgsless models is to compensate\nthe large negative infrared effect in T . However, when one includes spin-1 resonances, they also\ninduce a tree level contribution to S, which is often assumed to be positive but is generically\nrather large in magnitude.\nIn [4], an analysis was performed using an effective low energy description of resonance dynamics including the full T at one loop. It was found that quadratically ultraviolet sensitive one-loop\ncontributions of moderately light resonances can compensate the logarithmically divergent infrared\neffect in Eq. (5b) while giving a moderately large S, still within experimental bounds.\nHowever, the analysis of Ref. [4] only considers resonance contributions to S at tree level.\nSince there is no reason to expect small one-loop contributions to S, conclusions on the resonance\nspectrum and cut-off interplay in EWPT based on a correlated treatment of S and T may be\nsignificantly modified once the one-loop corrections to S are included. Especially so because\nloop corrections presumably induce UV sensitivity to S as well, skewing such correlations in a\nsubstantial way. Thus, a consistent correlated treatment of S and T should include quantum\ncorrections on both of them. In the present study we extend the EWPO analysis of Ref. [4] by\nincluding the full one-loop resonance contribution to S.\nThis paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we present the Lagrangian for the Higgsless\nmodel. The one-loop computation of S is addressed in Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to studying\nthe modification of EWPT constraints on the parameter space of low lying resonances in Higgsless\nmodels and the interplay between UV sensitivity and the low lying resonance spectrum. Finally,\nsome implications for direct resonance searches at colliders are discussed.\n\n2\n\nThe Lagrangian\n\nOur starting point will be a theory symmetric under G = SU (2)L \u00d7SU (2)R , spontaneously broken\ndown to the diagonal group H = SU (2)L+R .

It is customary to choose the following nonlinear realization\n\" 0\n#\n\u03c0\n+\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n1\n1\n2\ni2\u03c0\u0302/v\na a\n2\nU =u =e\n,\n\u03c0\u0302 = T \u03c0 = \u221a\n,\nT a = \u03c3a .\n\u03c00\n\u2212\n\u221a\n2\n2 \u03c0 \u2212 2\nThe lowest-order Lagrangian one can build is the usual chiral Lagrangian\nL(2)\n\u03c7 (U ) =\n\nv2\nhD\u03bc U (D\u03bc U )\u2020 i ,\n4\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the covariant derivative contains the W and B fields:\nD\u03bc U = \u2202\u03bc U \u2212 iB\u0302\u03bc U + iU \u0174\u03bc ,\n\n\u0174\u03bc = gT a W\u03bca ,\n\nB\u0302\u03bc = g 0 T 3 B\u03bc ,\n\n(8)\n\nand hi denotes the trace of the 2 \u00d7 2 matrices. Since we want to avoid tree level contributions to\nT , explicit custodial symmetry breaking terms in Eq. (7) are omitted.\nIt is worth emphasizing that Eq. (7) is universal, i.e., it does not depend on additional (heavy)\ndegrees of freedom. Therefore, it provides by itself a mechanism for EWSB which is perfectly\nconsistent: the Goldstone bosons become the longitudinal components of the W + , W \u2212 , Z gauge\nbosons, thereby providing (tree level) masses proportional to v with the exact same expressions\nas in the SM. The difference with the Higgs mechanism arises at the one-loop level \u2013 at the NLO\nin the chiral expansion. We have already emphasized that Higgsless models are in general nonrenormalizable: Eq. (7) is only the first term in a chiral expansion in powers of momenta while\nNLO terms in the chiral expansion capture ultraviolet effects (typically heavy resonances) in the\nmost general way.\nIn Higgsless models one often assumes that the new degrees of freedom are spin-1 resonances.\nWe will consider the presence of two vector states with opposite parity, A\u03bc\u03bd [1++ ] and V \u03bc\u03bd [1\u2212\u2212 ],\nboth belonging to the adjoint representation of SU (2)L+R :\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 hR\u03bc\u03bd h\u2020 ,\n\nR\u03bc\u03bd = A\u03bc\u03bd , V \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fFor phenomenological purposes we will assume v < mV,A < \u039b ' 4\u03c0v. In other words, we consider\ntwo relatively light resonances and make the natural cutoff \u039b of the theory (signaling the presence\nof new heavy degrees of freedom) to coincide with the loop expansion parameter \u039b\u03c7 = 4\u03c0v.\nFollowing Ref. [2], we describe the heavy spin-1 states in the antisymmetric tensor representation. Unlike in the vector representation, this way one avoids an unwanted mixing between the\naxial resonance and the pion. The kinetic term in the Lagrangian has the form:\n1\n1\nLkin (R\u03bc\u03bd ) = \u2212 h\u2207\u03bc R\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03c3 R\u03c3\u03bd i + m2R hR\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd i ,\n2\n4\nwith the covariant derivative defined as\ni\n1h \u2020\n\u2207\u03bc R = \u2202\u03bc R + [\u0393\u03bc , R],\n\u0393\u03bc =\nu (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 iB\u0302\u03bc )u + u(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 i\u0174\u03bc )u\u2020 ,\n2\n\n(10)\n\n\u0393\u2020\u03bc = \u2212\u0393\u03bc .\n\n(11)\n\nIn order to couple the heavy states to the Goldstone bosons it is convenient to define u\u03bc =\niu\u2020 D\u03bc U u\u2020 = u\u2020\u03bc , such that u\u03bc \u2192 hu\u03bc h\u2020 .\nThe leading order, O(p2 ), couplings of the heavy fields to Goldstone bosons and SM gauge\nfields are then parametrised in terms of 3 effective operators, defined by\n(2)\n\nL1V\n\ni\n1\n\u221a GV hV \u03bc\u03bd [u\u03bc , u\u03bd ]i + \u221a FV hV \u03bc\u03bd (u\u0174 \u03bc\u03bd u\u2020 + u\u2020 B\u0302 \u03bc\u03bd u)i\n2 2\n2 2\n1\n+ \u221a FA hA\u03bc\u03bd (u\u0174 \u03bc\u03bd u\u2020 \u2212 u\u2020 B\u0302 \u03bc\u03bd u)i .\n2 2\n=\n\n(12)\n\nThe effective couplings FV,A and GV have dimensions of mass and, by naive dimensional\nanalysis, are expected to be of O(v). More quantitative constraints can be found by requiring the resonance contribution to smoothen the ultraviolet divergences generated by the leading\norder term, Eq. (7), in a set of chosen correlators, in the spirit of [3]. For instance, perturbative unitarity in WL WL \u2192 WL WL scattering \u221a\nup to the natural cut-off scale of the model\n\u039b ' 4\u03c0v \u2248 3 TeV imposes the constraint GV ' v/ 3(1 \u00b1 0.2), mostly independent of the vector\nmass below mV < 1 TeV [4]. Furthermore, the pion vector form factor, in combination with\npositivity of\u221aFV , GV requires FV . v 2 /GV . Combined with the unitarity constraint on GV it\ngives FV . 3v [4]. Additionally, imposing the right ultraviolet behavior of \u03a030 (and neglecting\nheavier resonance contributions) suggests that mA > mV and also FV2 /m2V > FA2 /m2A , which are\nalso known as the Weinberg sum rules.\nAnother constraint which is typically discussed in Higgsless models is the \"hidden-gauge relation\" FV = 2GV . This relation holds in 3- and 4-site Higgsless models [4], and more generally\nin all five-dimensional deconstructed models as long as non-renormalizable terms in the bulk are\nneglected [7]. In more general Higgsless frameworks, however, it is typically not satisfied. In the\nfollowing sections we will check whether it is consistent with EWPO.\nFinally, let us stress that the interaction Lagrangian of Eq. (12) is only the most general O(p2 )\nchiral Lagrangian linear in resonance fields. Note that since there is no power counting that\nsupresses V\u03bc\u03bd and A\u03bc\u03bd , operators with an arbitrary number of resonance fields have the same\nchiral counting and appear already at O(p2 ). The predictability of the approach therefore rests\non the assumption that those extra operators do not contribute significantly. We will return to\nthis issue later on.\n\n5\n\n\fV, A\n\nFigure 3: Tree level resonance contribution to S.\n\n3\n\nS and T at one loop\n\nThe tree level exchange of the heavy vectors (Fig. 3) leads to well known contribution to S (and\nalso W, Y [5]) whereas it leaves T untouched because of the protecting SU (2)L+R symmetry:\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng 2 FV2\nFA2\n\u2206\u015cT ree =\n\u2212 2 ,\n(13a)\n4 m2V\nmA\n\u2206T\u0302T ree = 0 .\n\n(13b)\n\nThe contribution to S can in principle be positive or negative, although as discussed in the previous\nsection, positive values are preferred to comply with the right ultraviolet behavior of \u03a030 . This\nleads to the well-known problem of Higgsless models with EWPT, since tree level resonance\ncontributions actually worsen the predictions due to the pure infrared effects of Eqs. (5a, 5b).\nAt one loop one has to distinguish between the long distance and the short distance contributions. The former are depicted in Fig. 2 and, since they come entirely from Eq. (7), they coincide\nwith the SM result (with the Higgs mass instead of \u039b) and are given entirely by Eqs. (5a, 5b).\nOne-loop short distance contributions to T involve the diagrams with resonance exchange\nshown in Fig. 4. The calculation of loop contributions to T can be significantly simplified by\nnoticing that, up to corrections of relative order m2W /m2R\nT\u0302 =\n\nZ (+)\n\u2212 1,\nZ (0)\n\n(14)\n\nwhere Z (+) , Z (0) are the wave-function renormalization constants of the charged and neutral\nGoldstone bosons for the SM gauge bosons (in the Landau gauge) [6].1\nS receives one-loop short distance contributions from the diagrams depicted in Fig. 5. In\naddition, renormalization of the resonance masses and couplings entering the tree level contribution\nto S needs to be taken into account. It is easy to verify that the masses do not get renormalized\nat this order while the corrections to the FV,A couplings, depicted in Fig. 6, amount to the shifts\n\u0012\n\u0013\nFV \u2212 GV \u039b2\nFV \u2192 FV 1 +\n,\nFV\n(4\u03c0v)2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u039b2\nFA \u2192 FA 1 +\n.\n(15)\n(4\u03c0v)2\nNotice that the corrections are purely quadratic in \u039b and that no logarithmic terms are induced.\nThe presence of quadratically (ultraviolet) divergent pieces in the one-loop contributions to S and\n1\n\nContributions to U can be computed analogously.

We checked that our results for the\nlogarithmic contribution to \u015c agree with those found for L10 in ChPT with explicit resonance\nfields [8].2 Regarding T\u0302 , we have checked that in the hidden gauge limit our result agrees with [4].3\nThe first thing to note is that the quadratic contribution to T\u0302 is strictly positive, while the\nnew contribution to \u015c can in principle have either sign. In addition, the quadratic pieces are\nparametrically large, of the same order of magnitude as the tree level contributions. In principle\nit would then be desirable to find a way to cancel (or at least ameliorate) their size.\nOne possible mechanism is to impose the \"hidden gauge\" limit relations, FV \u2192 2GV , FA \u2192 0\nand mA \u2192 \u221e, which as we noted earlier arise naturally in a wide class of Higgsless models. The\nquadratic dependence in T\u0302 then identically cancels and we are left only with the logarithmic piece,\n2\n\nNote that one has to correct for the fact that the result in Ref. [8] is done in SU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R ChPT.\nWe are thankful to Axel Orgogozo and Slava Rychkov for pointing out an error in Eq. (17) in the first version\nof the paper [12].\n3\n\n8\n\n\fA, V\n\nA, V\n\nA, V\n\nV, A\n\nV, A\n\nV, A\n\nA, V\n\nA, V\n\nA, V\n\nFigure 8: Some contributions expected to regulate the quadratic divergences in \u015c.\nwhose sign is in principle not fixed. While this feature of the hidden-gauge limit for T\u0302 is very\nappealing, it was already noticed in [4] that the hidden-gauge relation conflicts with EWPO. Our\ncalculation here shows that it also fails to protect \u015c, which still scales quadratically due to the\nresonance loop in the right hand side diagram of Fig. 5. In particular, this implies that for the\nunitarity preferred values of GV and the natural cut-off scale, the one-loop contribution to \u015c is half\nthe tree level value. From Eq. (15) it also follows that the hidden gauge limit is not necessarily\nrespected by the renormalization of model parameters.\nThe alternative is to take the quadratic divergences as a physical effect. In Ref. [4] it was\nshown that the introduction of the following new operators bilinear in the resonance fields\nhA\u03bc\u03bd [\u2207\u03c1 V \u03c1\u03bd , u\u03bc ]i ;\n\nhV \u03bc\u03bd [\u2207\u03c1 A\u03c1\u03bd , u\u03bc ]i ,\n\n(18)\n\ncan cancel the quadratic divergences and tame the logarithmic ones. This contribution is shown\nin Fig. 7. Therefore, if the renormalization scale happens to be due to masses lying close to \u039b,\nthen the expression for T in Eqs. (16) should be a reasonable estimate.\nThe same mechanism in principle could apply for \u015c, but the situation becomes more involved.\nFirst, we have explicitly checked that the contribution of the operators of Eq. (18) not only does\nnot cancel the quadratic divergences in \u015c but introduces quartic ones. More operators are therefore\nneeded. For instance, we expect operators with 3 and 4 resonance fields of the form\nh[\u2207\u03bc V\u03bc\u03bd , \u2207\u03bb V\u03bb\u03c1 ]V \u03bd\u03c1 i ;\n\nh\u2207\u03bc V\u03bc\u03bd (V \u03b7\u03bd \u2207\u03bb V \u03bb\u03c1 V\u03b7\u03c1 + V\u03b7\u03c1 \u2207\u03bb V \u03bb\u03c1 V \u03b7\u03bd )i ,\n\n(19)\n\nto play a significant role. In particular, their contribution to the diagrams in Fig. 8 is expected\nto compensate the divergences coming from the right-hand side diagram in Fig. 5. The list of\noperators in Eq. (19) is however far from being exhaustive. For instance, one should also include\nterms mixing axial and vector fields to compensate for the divergences generated by the operators\nin Eq. (18). In general, such additional operators will also affect T\u0302 .\nWhile the full renormalization analysis is clearly beyond the scope of the present paper, we want\nto point out that it is in principle feasible. Even though there is no well-defined power counting\nfor the resonance fields, if one assumes the presence of a single vector and axial resonance field,\nthe one-loop renormalization of \u015c and T\u0302 and in general every EWPO can be accounted for with\noperators with up to 4 resonance fields. A reasonable strategy is then to assume that indeed there\nis a combination of operators able to regulate the quadratic (and quartic) divergences to both \u015c\n\n9\n\n\f1.6\n\nGV\n\n3 \u0090v\n\n1.4\n\narity\nUnit\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\nFV 12GV , FA =0\n\n0.8\n\nFV =2GV , FA 10\nFV 12GV , FA 10\n\n0.6\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nmV @GeVD\n\nFigure 9: Combination of unitarity (precise range taken as in Ref.

However, there is a potential problem\nwith such an assumption. If the renormalization scale for all diagrams is around \u039b the corrections\nto FV and FA are not necessarily well behaved perturbatively. Consequently, the values for FV\nand FA coming from the fit to EWPO may be unreliable. An alternative approach would be to\nrequire that FV,A renormalization in Fig. 6 is governed by the resonance scale, while the diagrams\nof Figs. 4 and 5 still get renormalized at the cutoff scale (in order to be consistent with EWPO).\nWhile such a scenario cannot be excluded, it would make the model unnaturally baroque. In the\nfollowing section we will show that fortunately even for a single renormalization scale close to \u039b,\nthe correlations between S and T tend to stabilize the values of FV and FA .\n\n4\n\nConfronting EWPT and Unitarity Constraints\n\nWe are now in the position to reconsider the interplay between the WL WL scattering unitarity\nconstraint and EWPT on the parameter space of Higgsless models at the one-loop level. We will\nstudy the impact of new contributions to \u015c by reexamining the scenarios and conclusions reached\nin the original analysis of Ref. [4], where the resonance contributions to \u015c were evaluated at the\ntree-level. The results are summarized in Fig. 9, where we plot the allowed regions in the GV\nversus mV plane by marginalizing over the remaining free parameters. In order to assess the\npotential consistency of more specific classes of Higgsless models with EWPO we will consider the\nfollowing scenarios (also marked in Fig. 9):\n\n10\n\n\f0.4\n\nFV \u00ae\n\n\u00ac\n\nm\n\nV\n\n0.2\n\nT\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nS\n\nFigure 10: Contributions to \u015c and T\u0302 in scenarios with a single vector resonance below the cut-off \u039b = 3 TeV.\n\n\u221a\nThe exact unitarity constraint GV = v/ 3 is imposed.

In addition to the IR logarithmic contributions and\nthe positive tree level contribution to \u015c, there are also quadratically UV sensitive one-loop\ncontributions to both \u015c and T\u0302 . They are strictly positive in T\u0302 but can be negative in \u015c,\nthus allowing for potential cancellations between the tree level and one loop contribution.\nInterestingly, a consistent fit to both \u015c and T\u0302 can be achieved for light vector masses,\nmV . 500 GeV, and reasonable values of the parameter FV . 2GV , as illustrated in Fig. 10.\nComparing with Ref. [4], one observes that the main impact of the one-loop contribution to\n\u015c is to lower the allowed vector resonance mass while raising the value of FV . If one assumes\nthat the value for FV is stable under quantum corrections, then this scenario is already in\nconflict with bounds from direct resonance searches at the Tevatron [10]. This might well be\nthe case: even though the operators we are considering induce a naive O(1) loop correction\nto FV , their values extracted from the electroweak fit (with and without considering vertex\ncorrections) only differ by roughly 15%. In other words, the EWPO fit seems to point to a\nstable region of parameters.\n\n\u2022 FV = 2GV , FA 6= 0, (mV , mA ) < \u039b, i.e., a vector resonance fulfilling the hidden gauge\nrelation plus an axial-vector resonance, both below the cut-off scale. An axial resonance is\ncommonly considered in Higgsless models since its contribution reduces the size of \u2206\u015c at\ntree level. At one loop it contributes with a quadratic UV sensitivity to both \u015c and T\u0302 . We\nnote that while the contribution to the latter is always positive, it can be either sign for\nthe former, again opening the door for fine-tuned cancellations between FA , mA and mV .\nFigure 11 shows that a consistent fit to both \u015c and T\u0302 can only be achieved for relatively\n\n11\n\n\f0.4\n\nmA \u0090mV \u00ae\nmV \u00ae\n\n0.2\n\nT\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nS\n\nFigure 11: Contributions to \u015c and T\u0302 in the scenario with a vector resonance fulfilling FV = 2GV and an axial\n\n\u221a\nresonance below \u039b = 3 TeV.

We note that mA can be made heavier at\nthe expense of increasing FA . In other words, even though the one loop expression introduces\nthe new ratio v/mA , apparently it does not break the correlation between FA and mA that\none has at tree level.\n\u2022 FV 6= 2GV , FA 6= 0, (mV , mA ) < \u039b, i.e., the most generic Higgsless model, containing a\nsingle light vector and axial-vector resonance below the cut-off. Due to the large parameter\nspace available, various cancellations can occur (as the ones outlined in the previous two\ncases), leading to an agreement with EWPT as well as satisfying the unitarity constraint.\nThe various parameter dependences are studied in Fig. 12. We first observe that EWPO\nand the unitarity constraint can only be reconciled for vector masses below 900 GeV, as\nshown in the upper-left plot of Fig. 12 and confirmed in Fig. 9. Secondly, the upper-right\nplot in Fig. 12 confirms that the axial and vector states should be fairly degenerate, at least\nfor natural values of FA . In the lower plot in Fig. 12 we show that for light vector and axial\nvector states, the model can accomodate the EWPO constraints with reasonable values for\nthe two coupling constants, namely FA . FV . 2GV , leading to a quite constrained and\npredictive scenario even in this more general case.\nIn summary, Fig. 9 confirms the general conclusion of Ref. [4], namely that accounting for both\nEWPT and unitarity constraints can be satisfied with at least one light (vector) resonance. However, after including the one-loop resonance contributions to \u015c the allowed parameter ranges are\nshifted and get significantly more constrained. In particular, two important modifications appear:\n(1) the generic bound on the lightest vector resonance mass is strengthened to below 1 TeV and\n\n12\n\n\f0.4\n\n0.4\n\nmA \u0090mV =1.4\nFV,A \u00ae\n\n0.4\n\nFV,A \u00ae\n\n0.2\n\nmA \u00ae\n\n0.2\n\nmV =400GeV\nmA =500GeV\nFV \u00ae\n\n\u00ac FA\n\n\u00acm\n\nV ,A\n\n0.2\n\nmV =400GeV\n\nT\n\n0.0\n\nT\n\n0.0\n\nT\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n-0.6\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\nS\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nS\n\n0.4\n\n-0.6\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nS\n\nFigure 12:\n\nContributions to \u015c and T\u0302 in the scenario with a vector and an axial resonance below the cut-off\n\u221a\nof \u039b = 3 TeV. The exact unitarity constraint GV = v/ 3 is imposed. On the upper-left plot, FA = FV and\nmA /mV = 1.4 while mV and FV are varied in the ranges 500 GeV \u2264 mV \u2264 1 TeV, 0.9 \u2264 FV /2GV \u2264 1. On the\nupper-right plot, again FA = FV and vector mass is fixed at mV = 400 GeV. The remainig parameters are varied\nin the ranges 540 GeV \u2264 mA \u2264 700 GeV, 0.8 \u2264 FV /2GV \u2264 0.95 . On the lower plot, the vector and axial masses\nare fixed at mV = 400 GeV and mA = 500 GeV, while the couplings are varied in the ranges 0.9 \u2264 FV /2GV \u2264 0.95\nand 0.8 \u2264 FA /2GV \u2264 0.9.\n\n(2) a single vector resonance below the cut-off now requires a sizable FV coupling, something that\nis possibly in conflict with bounds from direct searches at the Tevatron.\nGenerically, in all the studied scenarios the one-loop contributions required to bring S back into\nthe experimental bounds are large and the loop expansion poorly convergent. This is especially\ntroublesome for the stability of the parameters of the model under quantum corrections. However,\nthese potentially large corrections turn out to have a very mild effect for the parameter ranges\nfitted from S and T . The reason can be found in the structure of the corrections to both S and\nT . Let us concentrate on the quadratic pieces, which are the dominant ones. Note that the sum\nof vector and axial contributions is fixed by the moderate size of \u2206T\u0302U V . Since they are small and\nmoreover they enter \u2206\u015cU V roughly as a difference, the correction to S is actually driven by the\nv/mV,A pieces coming from the resonance kinetic terms. In other words, the soft breaking of the\ncustodial symmetry is constraining the couplings near the EW scale and thus indirectly protecting\nthe model parameters, in particular FV , from overly large quantum corrections.\nThe increased sensitivity to cancellations among individual contributions to EWPO, as reflected in the very constrained parameter ranges in Figs. 10, 11 and 12 warrants a brief discussion\non fine-tuning of the studied scenarios. We evaluate the naturalness of solutions in the parameter\nspace, which satisfy both unitarity and EWPO constraints in the most generic scenario outlined\nabove.

The coloring corresponds to the fine-tuning measure \u2206 as defined in the\nmain text.\n\nand then define the maximum fine-tuning of a particular parameter space point as \u2206 = max{\u2206i,j }.\nNote that \u2206 = 10, 50 corresponds to a 10% , 2% fine-tuning respectively.\nWe apply \u2206i,j above to\n\u221a\n\u015c and T\u0302 and define the relevant parameters as mV , mA /mV , GV 3/v, FV /2GV and FA /FV .

The results are shown in\nFig. 13. We observe that the fine-tuning required to be consistent with EWPO at the 68 \u2212 95%\nconfidence level is at the order or 5 \u2212 2%, respectively. It is also interesting to note that at\nthis level of fine-tuning the 95% confidence level region with negative \u015c (and T\u0302 ) can be reached.\nHowever, this region corresponds to the one-loop contributions to \u015c actually overcompensating\nthe tree-level contributions, signaling the breakdown of the loop expansion.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have computed the one-loop corrections to the S parameter in the generic Higgsless\nmodel considered in Ref. [4]. Likewise, we have assume the existence of light resonances (a vector\nand possibly an axial vector state) in the window v < mV,A < \u039b ' 4\u03c0v whose dynamics are\ndescribed by a minimal set of operators. This has allowed us to consistently study the predictions\nof the model for EWPO at next-to-leading order, subject to the unitarity constraint in WL WL\nscattering.\nOur results show that the S and T parameters can be made compatible with the experimental\nvalues, but most likely a single vector resonance is not enough. While a light vector is in principle\n\n14\n\n\fallowed by EWPT and unitarity, direct searches by CDF and D0 require very small values of\nthe coupling FV , something that the fits do not favor. The addition of an axial resonance thus\nseems to be needed. The picture that eventually emerges turns out to be highly predictive, with\nthe vector mass constrained to the window 500 GeV. mV . 1000 GeV, and the axial one only\nslightly heavier, 1.2 m\u221a\nV \u2264 mA \u2264 1.4 mV . The values for the remaining parameters satisfy\nFA . FV . 2GV \u223c 2v/ 3.\nWhile this is the order of magnitude one would naturally expect for the parameters, one cannot\navoid a considerable amount of fine-tuning. The reason, which lies at the heart of Higgsless models,\nis that the tree level contribution to the S parameter is positive and rather large, and therefore a\nlarge and negative one-loop contribution is needed to pull it back to the experimentally allowed\nregion. In addition, the tree-level contributions proportional to FV,A /mV,A develop quadratic (but\nnot logarithmic) dependences on the cutoff \u039b at the one-loop order. In our case, the one-loop\ncontributions scale parametrically as \u039b2 /(4\u03c0m)2 , m < 1 TeV being a typical resonance mass and\n\u039b \u223c 3 TeV being the cut-off. We assume the cutoff scale to be close to a physical scale (typically\nthe mass of a heavier vector), such that the estimate of the quadratic corrections is reasonable.\nIn Ref. [4] the simple addition of two extra operators was shown to do the job quite naturally, at\nleast for T . In this paper we have seen that the dynamical mechanism has to be more complicated\nto also account for S: the operators proposed in [4] not only do not cure the UV sensitivity, but\nthey introduce additional quartic divergences. While they can in general be tamed, the dynamical\nmechanism loses its main appeal, simplicity: a potentially large number of additional operators\nmight be required. We have however assumed that such mechanism is at work and that the scale\n\u039b is representative for higher mass states, not explicitly included as dynamical fields in the model.\nIt turns out that the soft breaking of custodial symmetry and the moderate corrections to T ,\nas preferred by the EWPO fit, actually help to stabilize the parameters of the model against\npotentially large quantum corrections, leading to a well defined and predictive scenario.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Gino Isidori for invaluable discussions and initial involvement in this project.
