In HF materials the correlation effects manifest themselves as a strong increase of\nthe effective mass of the charge carriers at low temperatures accompanied with a crossover to the behavior of\na Landau Fermi liquid1 . Hybridization between originally localized f -states and the itinerant band states of\nthese mainly Ce- and U -based compounds is causing this\nbehavior. In special cases, either by chemical substitution or by external stimuli, such as applying pressure or\na magnetic field, a sub-class of the HF system can be\ntuned into a quantum critical state2 . In this state, characterized by the shift of a magnetic phase transition to\nT = 0K, magnetic fluctuations exert their influence not\nonly at T = 0K but also at higher temperatures and\ncause strong deviations from Landau's Fermi liquid behavior. Consequently, these materials are said to behave\nas non-Fermi liquids. In these non-Fermi liquids the low\nlying charge excitations cannot be simply described as\nquasi-particle excitations. Nevertheless, superconducting\n(SC) condensates can form in the non-Fermi liquid state\nwhich is, e.g., the case for CeCoIn5 3 . The nature of the\nSC state in this HF material is therefore particularly interesting. Several experiments, such as magnetic field\ndependent heat conductivity4 , specific heat5 and also\npoint contact spectroscopy6 have provided evidence for a\ndx2 \u2212y2 order parameter. As has been demonstrated for\nselected high temperature superconductors, phase sensitive experiments employing the Josephson effect can be\nvery helpful in elucidating the order parameter type in a\nvery direct way. This pathway for HF superconductors\nis, however, difficult to follow. It mainly relies on the\navailability of epitaxial thin films. For selected materials\nefforts in this direction have been successful7\u20139 and have\neventually led to well characterized tunnel junctions10\u201312 .\nFor CeCoIn5 , however, attempts by severals groups have\nso far not led to epitaxial growth13\u201315 . As a possible\nway out of this difficulty we have previously developed\na technique for addressing individual growth domains or\nmicrocrystals in c-axis oriented thin films of CeCoIn5\n\nby combining focused ion beam (FIB) etching and focused particle beam induced deposition with appropriate\nprecursors16\u201318 . In this work we take advantage of the\nde-wetting tendency during early stages of CeCoIn5 thin\nfilm growth on a-plane sapphire for selecting an individual growth domain or microcrystal of about two micrometer lateral dimensions suitable for the fabrication of a\nmicrobridge-based SQUID. Both, the SQUID loop and\nthe individual microbridges exhibit well-defined voltage\nmodulations in an external magnetic field. The microbridges critical dc Josephson current is in good agreement\nwith the Ambegaokar-Baratoff (AB) model19 . Furthermore, in the dynamic resistance we see clear signatures\nof periodic vortex motion in the microbridges. These results point towards a very promising approach for phase\nsensitive studies in HF superconductors.\n\nII.\n\nPREPARATIONS\n\nThe CeCoIn5 thin film was grown on a 10 \u00d7 10mm2\na\u2212plane \u03b1 \u2212 Al2 O3 substrate by molecular beam epitaxy method with the growth details and a typical surface morphology reported earlier16 . The thin film was\npre-patterned with conventional ultra violet photolithography and ion beam etching. The micro-structuring (see\nFig. 1 (a) and (b)) was performed with FIB milling in\nan FEI Nova NanoLab 600 dual beam scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM). The outer electrodes (not shown in\nthe figure) were metallic W -composite leads prepared by\nFIB induced deposition using W (CO)6 as precursor gas.\nA SEM micrograph of the prepared SQUID is shown in\nFig. 1c and a detailed view of one of the microbridges in\nthe inset. The electrical measurements were performed\nin a 3 He cryostat employing a four-probe method and\na standard differential resistance measurement technique\nusing current modulation.\n\nIII.\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\nThe four-probe resistance of the loop was measured\nduring cool down at a small constant current I, and\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1. (Color online) (a) FIB milling of the microcrystal\nwith its current and voltage leads out of the interconnected\ncrystals, (b) FIB milling of the loop center and the bridges,\n(c) SEM micrograph of the such prepared SQUID. The inset\nin (c) shows a detailed view of one of the two bridges. The\nloop dimensions are 2.1\u03bcm \u00d7 1.9\u03bcm, as a mean value between\nthe outer and inner diameters, respectively. The estimated\nmicrobridges length and width are L \u2248 90nm and width W \u2248\n250nm, respectively. The film thickness is about 300nm.\n\nits low temperature region is shown in the inset of\nFig. 2. The complete curve shows the typical behavior for CeCoIn5 , as was reported for microcrystal\nmeasurements before16 . The residual resistance ratio\nR300K /RaboveTc was found to be 2.9, and is slightly better\nthan in the aforementioned work. However, this value is\nstill small when compared to the value for bulk crystals,\nwhich indicates a lower crystal quality for this microcrystal. The resistivity at 2.5K is also slightly larger than was\nreported for single crystals20 . The onset of superconductivity is found at 2.0K, somewhat lower than that of\na bulk crystal. Another smooth transition is found at\naround 1.5K, which we attribute to the Josephson coupling temperature TJ . This transition we ascribe to the\nSC transition in the bridges, and the local Tc being reduced by the FIB milling process. Also, an important\nfeature is the finite resistance R0 \u2248 0.07\u03a9 (also when\nI \u2192 0) at the lowest temperature, which we explain as\nfollows. Thermally activated processes may fundamentally modify the voltage-to-current V \u2212 I relation of a\nJosephson junction. In particular, as was shown by Ambegaokar and Halperin21 , there is always a finite resistance even below the Josephson critical current Ic . This\nmay be viewed as an overdamped junction, i.e. a junction for which the McCumber parameter is small, which\nis expected to be the case for microbridges22 .\nThe theoretical analysis of bridges whose dimensions\nare large compared to the Ginsburg-Landau (GL) coherence length \u03be is difficult. For large ratios of W/\u03be and\nL/\u03be the bridge leaves the regime of the 'ideal' Josephson behavior and enters the Abricosov vortex motion\nregime, as was pointed out by Likharev22 . As a result, essential characteristics of the bridge are modified,\nsuch as the shape of SQUID voltage modulations or the\n\nFIG. 2. Set of measured dynamic resistance curves for the\nSQUID as a function of current. The features on the lowest curve are ascribed to the periodic motion of vortices and\nshown with arrows (see text for details). The inset shows the\nmeasured four-probe resistance during cool down in the low-T\nregion. The arrow denotes an additional transition at 1.5K\nassociated to the Josephson coupling temperature TJ . Note\nthe non-zero resistivity even at the lowest temperatures.\n\ndependence Ic (T )22,23 . The dimensions of our bridges\nwhen compared with \u03beCeCoIn5 \u2248 5nm24 make both ratios W/\u03be \u2248 18 and L/\u03be \u2248 50 large.\nIn the main part of Fig. 2 we show a set of measured\ndynamic resistance curves as a function of current plotted\nfor selected temperatures. The curves measured above Tc\nshow an anomalous background resistance, visible up to\n10K, out of which evolves the SC state. This nonlinearity, which we do not attribute to self heating effects, will\nbe addressed in a separate publication. Signatures of superconductivity become evident on top of the background\nanomaly at about 2.0K and become more pronounced as\nthe temperature decreases. At temperatures below TJ\nthe curves develop additional features, which we marked\nby arrows on the lowest curve.\nThe inset in Fig. 3 shows typical measured SQUID\nvoltage oscillations as a function of an externally applied\nmagnetic field. The oscillations are well reproducible and\nof sine-like shape without asymmetries. The period of\nthe measured oscillations corresponds to one flux quantum \u03a60 = h/2e over the averaged loop area with excellent\nagreement. Occasionally, the oscillations become phaseshifted by a random amount. Since the oscillations are a\nmeasure of the SC phase difference between the two SC\narms modulated by an external magnetic field, we attribute these phase slips to randomly trapped flux. The\nmain part of Fig. 3 shows a long period modulation superimposed with the SQUID modulations, which appear as\na band due to the scale. We ascribe them to the Joseph-\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3. Measured voltage oscillations as a function of external\nmagnetic field on a large scale. The inset shows the small scale\nSQUID oscillations. Note in the main part that due to the\nscale the SQUID oscillations appear as a band of values on\ntop of the slow modulation.\n\nson modulations of the two individual bridges. These oscillations are also affected by random phase slips. Their\nperturbed periodicity might be caused by interference effects between both bridges, since they are coupled by the\nSC wave function in the arms. A rough estimate of the\nperiod for these oscillations gives 10mT , and according\nto s = \u03a60 /B implies that the effective dimensions of each\nbridge extend into each SC bank by about 200nm, which\ncompares favorably with the London penetration depth\n\u03bbL for CeCoIn5 24 .\n\nIV.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe observed strong manifestation of the Josephson\neffect enables us to analyze the peculiarities of the transport characteristics at low temperatures in the framework of models developed for the Josephson effect in\nmicrobridges25\u201328 . The Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) theory25\nmay be used for the analysis of the V \u2212 I characteristics of microbridges of a geometry similar to ours when\nvortex dynamics has to be accounted for, i.e. W \u001d \u03be\nand L > \u03be. In the framework of this model the electrical\ncurrent density across the\u221abridge is non-uniform, and is\ndescribed as j(x) = J/\u03c0d a2 \u2212 x2 , where J is the total\ncurrent along the bridge, d is the bridge thickness, a is\nequal to W/2, and x is the coordinate along the width\nof the bridge with x = 0 at the bridge center. It may\nbe shown that two vortices of opposite helicity are most\nlikely to enter the bridge from opposite edges due to the\nlocally highest current density there.\nAs is shown in the AL model, the total force acting\non the n \u2212 th vortex is Fn = \u2212FL + Fs \u00b1 Fvv . Here,\n\nFL is the Lorentz force due to the interaction with current J, Fs is the interaction with the edge, and Fvv is\nthe vortex-vortex interaction term. At low T a vortex\nremains pinned to the edge due to Fs as long as the\ncounteracting Lorentz force is FL \u2264 Fs . Neglecting the\nFvv term when the number of vortices in the bridge is\nsmall, one may\np derive the current at which FL = Fs\nas JC \u2248 J0 (a/2\u03be), where J0 = c2 h\u0304d/8e\u03bb2L . At this\nand larger currents vortex pairs start a periodic viscous\nmotion toward the bridge center with successive annihilation and new creation of a vortex pair at the edges.\nAs the J and FL increase, more than one vortex pair\nmay be present simultaneously within the bridge giving\na discontinuity on the V \u2212 I curve. However, due to\nthe associated increase of the Fvv , any succeeding current span will differ from the previous one. The equation\nof motion of the n \u2212 th vortex is given by \u1e8bn = Fn /\u03b7,\nwhere \u03b7 is the viscosity coefficient. Finally, solving this\nequation one finds the period of moving vortices, which is\nequal to the period T in the Josephson frequency relation\nh\u0304\u03c9 = 2\u03c0h\u0304/T = 2eV\u0304 , where V\u0304 is the averaged measured\nvoltage. Hence, the electrical current J is related with V\u0304 .\nAccording to the AL model discontinuities on the V \u2212 I\ncurves are periodic in the voltage. One may show that\nthis periodicity is given by (SI units):\n1 4\u03c0\n1\ndh\u03043\n\u221a\nV0 = \u221a\n2\n3\n2 2 \u03bc0 a \u03bea\u03bbef f e \u03b7\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bbef f is the effective penetration depth, which\nwe take as \u03bbL , since \u03bbL \u2248 d and the correction is small.\nWe attribute the smoothed peaks marked with arrows in\nFig. 2 each to a new number of vortex pairs moving simultaneously in the bridge. They appear, as expected, just\nabove Ic . Three corresponding peaks are well resolved,\nwhich in our case implies that the strong repulsion between neighbored vortices of equal helicity limits considerably their number. This is very probable because the\naverage inter-vortex distance a/3 is comparable with the\nvortex radius. Also, large values of \u03bbL \u2248 235nm29 for\nCeCoIn5 do increase the inter-vortex repulsive coupling.\nThe peaks are not equidistant with current, which is also\nexpected from the AL model, but the voltage peaks are\nequidistant with a period of about 125\u03bcV with good accuracy. This periodicity we ascribe to V0 as predicted\nby the AL model. One may obtain the viscosity coefficient \u03b7 from Eq. (1). Using \u03bbL = 235nm, the approximate thickness in the bridge as d/2 \u2248 150nm, and\n\u03be = 10nm24 we find \u03b7 \u2248 5.0 \u00d7 10\u221215 (AV s2 m\u22122 ). The\nagreement with the Bardeen-Stephen theory30 is good,\nwhich gives \u03b7 \u2248 2.6 \u00d7 10\u221215 (AV s2 m\u22122 ) using \u03be = 10nm\nand the normal state resistivity \u03c1n = 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22127 \u03a9m.\nA temperature dependence of the reduced Josephson\ncritical current Ic for the two bridges is shown in Fig. 4.\nThe dots represent measured data and the solid lines are\ntheoretical curves for several cases using the measured TJ\nand the normal state resistance Rn . It is clear that the\nAB model19 fits the data well, although Rn = 68\u03a9 has\n\n\f4\nmodels. We have to state that the observed Ic (T ) dependence does not follow the probably expected behavior\ntheoretically predicted for microbridges in the dirty or\nclean limit. These models do not take a possible influence of Andreev bound states31 for a d-wave order parameter into account, which may be one reason for this\ndiscrepancy.\n\nV.\n\nFIG. 4. The reduced Josephson critical current for an individual microbridge plotted versus temperature. Circles represent the measured data. Solid curves are calculated for:\n(AB)-Ambegaokar-Baratoff, Kulik-Omel'yanchuk models for\ndiffusive regime (KO-I), and for ballistic regime (KO-II). TJ\ndenote the Josephson coupling temperature. The measured\nvalue of the normal state resistance Rn \u2248 42\u03a9, while effective\none used for the AB fit is 68\u03a9. The measured Ic at the lowest\ntemperature is \u2248 5.2\u03bcA\n\nto be used instead of the measured value of 42\u03a9. This is\nnot unexpected. On the one hand, the AB fit tends to\noverestimate the value of Ic for L > \u03be, since Rn growth\nlinearly with L but the GL order parameter in the middle of the bridge falls off exponentially. On the other\nhand, the AB model is derived for tunnel junctions, that\nis L \u001c \u03be and with no scattering within the barrier. In\ncontradistinction, models derived for microconstrictions,\nsuch as that by Kulik and Omel'yanchuk, in the dirty\nand clean limit26,27 or Ishii's model28 for long bridges do\nnot fit the data. Additionally, the shape of the voltage\nmodulations are not asymmetric, as expected in these\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nfoyevtsov@physik.uni-frankfurt.de\nmichael.huth@physik.uni-frankfurt.de\nG.

First, the fact that the micro-patterning\napproach used here is not detrimental to the superconducting state in CeCoIn5 indicates a certain robustness\nof this state. Considering, as a rule, the high sensitivity\nof the superconducting properties in other heavy-fermion\nsuperconductors, this may point toward an enhanced stability of the superconducting state when formed from a\nnon-Fermi liquid. Second, the approach followed here\nprovides junctions with rather close-to-ideal characteristics, which is promising with regard to utilizing other microbridge geometries. These geometries, such as recently\nproposed by Gumann and Schopohl32 or also a \u03c0-junction\nstructure, which can e.g. be formed by the combination\nof a conventional SC lead prepared by focused ion beam\ninduced deposition using the W (CO)6 precursor with a\nCeCoIn5 microcrystal, can provide phase-sensitive information about the superconducting state in CeCoIn5 .\nWork along these lines is in progress.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the Deutsche\nForschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for financial support under grant no.
