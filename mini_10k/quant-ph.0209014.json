INTRODUCTION\n\nEntanglement is the most characteristic trait of quantum mechanics [1]. An entangled state of a system consisting\nof two subsystems cannot be described as a product (or a statistical mixtures of products) of the quantum states\nof the two subsystems. In such a state, the system is inseparable and each component does not have properties\nindependent of the other components. The nonlocal character of entangled states is at the basis of many paradoxes\n[2], and of the deep difference between the quantum and the classical world. The fundamental role of entanglement\nhas been reemphasized in recent years after the discovery that it represents an unvaluable resource for quantum\ninformation processing [3]. In fact, entanglement is at the basis of secure quantum key distribution schemes [4], of\nquantum teleportation [5], and of the speed-up provided by some quantum algorithms [6]. It is generally believed\nthat entanglement can be found only in situations involving a small number of microscopic particles. For example,\na given amount of entanglement is present between two different spins in the thermal equilibrium state of a system\nof many interacting spins (the so-called thermal or natural entanglement [7]). However, for quantum information\nprocessing, it is the deterministic generation and manipulation of entanglement which is of paramount importance,\nand in these last years a number of impressive experiments has demonstrated the controlled generation of entangled\nstates of two [8], three [9] and four [10] particles. Moreover, since entanglement is one of the distinguishing features\nof the quantum world, it is also fundamental to understand how far it can be extended into the macroscopic domain.\nThis is important not only to better establish how the macroscopic classical world emerges from the microscopic one\nruled by quantum mechanics [11], but also for application purposes. For example, entangled spin-squeezed states\nof atomic samples are known to improve the precision of frequency measurements [12], and the accuracy improves\nwith increasing number of entangled atoms. A related question is to establish if and how two macroscopic degrees of\nfreedom of two different objects can be entangled. With this respect, a striking achievement has been recently shown\nin [13], where the entanglement between the spin states of two separated Cs gas samples containing about 1012 atoms\nhas been demonstrated. At the same time we proposed a feasible experiment [14] in which even a more macroscopic\nentanglement between the oscillating modes of two mirrors with an effective mass of some milligrams can be generated\nby the radiation pressure of the light bouncing between them (see also [15] for a different and extremely idealized\nmodel for the preparation of motion entangled states of two cavity mirrors). The continuous variable entanglement\nbetween two mechanical modes could be used to improve the detection of weak classical forces in optomechanical\ndevices as atomic force microscopes or gravitational wave detectors [16,17].\nIn this paper we analyze in more detail and further develop the proposal of [14]. In fact, Ref. [14] restricted to\nthe case of identical cavity mirrors, i.e., considered, for each mirror, a single oscillation mode with identical effective\nmass, optomechanical coupling, damping rate and, above all, identical resonance frequency. However, [14] showed that\nthe entanglement is present only within a small bandwidth around the mechanical resonance, and since in practice\ntwo mirrors are never exactly identical, it is important to establish the conditions under which entanglement can be\ngenerated between two mechanical modes with different resonance frequencies, and its dependence on the frequency\nmismatch.\nIn Section II we describe the optomechanical system under study in terms of quantum Langevin equations. In\nSection III we solve the dynamics of the system in the frequency domain, and then we characterize in detail the\nentanglement between the two mirrors. Section IV is for concluding remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fII. THE SYSTEM\n\nWe consider an optical ring cavity in which two perfectly reflecting mirrors can both oscillate under the effect of\nthe radiation pressure force (see Fig. 1). The motion of each mirror is the result of the excitation of many oscillation\nmodes, either external [18,19] or internal [20,21]. The former is important for suspended mirrors since the excitation\nof pendulum modes of the suspension system leads to global displacements of the mirror. The latter corresponds to\ndeformations of the mirror surface due to the excitation of internal acoustic modes of the substrate. These various\ndegrees of freedom have however different resonance frequencies and one can select the mechanical response of a single\nparticular mode by using a bandpass filter in the detection circuit [22]. For this reason we shall consider a single\nmechanical mode for each mirror, which will be therefore described as a simple harmonic oscillator. Since we shall\nconsider two mirrors with similar design, the two modes will be characterized by different, but quite close, values for\nthe frequencies, \u03a91 and \u03a92 , and for the effective masses, m1 and m2 .\nThe optomechanical coupling between the mirrors and the cavity field is realized by the radiation pressure. The\nelectromagnetic field exerts a force on a movable mirror which is proportional to the intensity of the field, which,\nat the same time, is phase-shifted by a quantity proportional to the the mirror displacement from the equilibrium\nposition.\nIn the adiabatic limit in which the mirror frequency is much smaller than the cavity free spectral range\n\u221a\nc/(2 2L) (L is the diagonal of the square optical path in the cavity, see Fig. 1), one can focus on one cavity mode\nonly (with annihilation operator b and frequency \u03c9b ), because photon scattering into other modes can be neglected\n[23]. One gets the following Hamiltonian [24]\nH = h\u0304\u03c9b b\u2020 b +\n\u2212h\u0304b\u2020 b\n\n2\nX\nh\u0304\u03a9i\ni=1\n\n2\nX\nj=1\n\n2\n\np2i + qi2\n\n\u0001\n\n(1)\n\n\u0001\n\u221a\n(\u22121)j Gj qj + ih\u0304 \u03b3b \u03b2 in e\u2212i\u03c9b0 t b\u2020 \u2212 \u03b2 in \u2217 ei\u03c9b0 t b ,\n\nwhere qipand pi are the dimensionless position and momentum operators of the mirrors with [qi , pj ] = i\u03b4ij , Gj =\n(\u03c9b /2L) h\u0304/mj \u03a9j (j = 1, 2) are the optomechanical coupling constants, and the last terms in Eq. 1 describe the\nlaser driving the cavity mode, characterized by a frequency \u03c9b0 and a power Pbin = h\u0304\u03c9b0 |\u03b2 in |2 (\u03b3b is the cavity mode\nlinewidth).\nA detailed analysis of the problem, however, must include photon losses, and the thermal noise on the mirrors. It\nmeans that the interaction of the optical mode with its reservoir and the effect of thermal fluctuations on the two\nmirrors, not considered in Hamiltonian (1), must be added. This can be accomplished in the standard way [25,26]. We\nneglect instead all the technical sources of noise, i.e., we shall assume that the driving laser is stabilized in intensity\nand frequency, also because recent experiments have shown that classical laser noise can be made negligible in the\nrelevant frequency range [19,20]. The full quantum dynamics of the system can be exactly described by the following\nnonlinear Langevin equations (in the interaction picture with respect to h\u0304\u03c9b b\u2020 b)\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u1e03 = i(\u03c9b0 \u2212 \u03c9b )b \u2212 ib(G1 q1 \u2212 G2 q2 ) \u2212 \u03b32b b + \u03b3b bin + \u03b2in ,\n(2)\nq\u0307j = \u03a9j pj ,\n\u1e57j = \u2212\u03a9j qj + (\u2212)j Gj b\u2020 b \u2212 \u0393j pj + \u03bej ,\nwhere \u0393j (j = 1, 2) are the mechanical damping rates of the mechanical modes, bin (t) represent the vacuum white\nnoise operator at the cavity input [25], and the Langevin noise operators for the quantum Brownian motion of the\nmirrors are \u03bej (t). The non-vanishing noise correlations are\nhbin (t)bin \u2020 (t\u2032 )i = \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) ,\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\nh\u0304\u03c9\n\u0393j \u03c9\ncos [\u03c9(t \u2212 t\u2032 )] \u2212 i sin [\u03c9(t \u2212 t\u2032 )] ,\ncoth\nh\u03bej (t)\u03bek (t\u2032 )i = \u03b4j,k\nd\u03c9\n2\u03a9j\n2kB T\n0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the equilibrium temperature (the two mirrors are considered in equilibrium\nwith their respective bath at the same temperature). Notice that the used approach for the Brownian motion is\nquantum mechanical consistent at every temperature [26].\nWe consider the situation when the driving field is very intense. Under this condition, the system is characterized\nby a semiclassical steady state with the internal cavity mode in a coherent state |\u03b2i, and a displaced equilibrium\n2\n\n\fposition for the mirrors. The steady state values are obtained by taking the expectation values of Eqs. (2), factorizing\nthem and setting all the time derivatives to zero. One gets\nhqj iss = (\u2212)j Gj |\u03b2|2 /\u03a9j ,\nhpj iss = 0,\n\u221a\n\u03b2 \u2261 hbiss = \u03b3b \u03b2 in / (\u03b3b /2 \u2212 i\u2206b ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u2206b \u2261 \u03c9b0 \u2212 \u03c9b \u2212 G1 hq1 iss + G2 hq2 iss , is the cavity mode detuning.\nUnder these semiclassical conditions, the dynamics is well described by linearizing Eqs. (2) around the steady state.\nIf we now use the same symbols for the operators describing the quantum fluctuations around the steady state, we\nget the following linearized quantum Langevin equations\n\u221a\n\u1e03 = i\u2206b b \u2212 i\u03b2(G1 q1 \u2212 G2 q2 ) \u2212 \u03b32b b + \u03b3b bin ,\nq\u0307j = \u03a9j pj ,\n\u1e57j = \u2212\u03a9j qj + (\u2212)j Gj (\u03b2 \u2217 b + \u03b2b\u2020 ) \u2212 \u0393j pj + \u03bej .\n\n(5)\n\nIII. ENTANGLEMENT CHARACTERIZATION\n\nThe time evolution of the system can be easily obtained by solving the linear quantum Langevin equations (5).\nHowever, as it happens in quantum optics for squeezing (see for example [25]), it is more convenient to study the\nsystem dynamics in the frequency domain. In fact, it is possible that, due to the effect of damping, and thermal and\nquantum noise, the two mechanical modes of the mirrors are never entangled in time, i.e., there is no time instant in\nwhich the reduced state of the two mechanical modes is entangled, unless appropriate (but difficult to prepare) initial\nconditions of the whole system are considered. Entanglement can be instead always present at a given frequency.\nIn fact, the two mirrors constitute, for each frequency, a continuous variable bipartite system which, in a given\nfrequency bandwidth, can be in an entangled state. The Fourier analysis refers to the quantum fluctuations around\nthe semiclassical steady state discussed in the preceding Section, and the eventual entanglement found at a given\nfrequency would refer to a stationary state of the corresponding spectral modes, maintained by the radiation mode,\nand which decays only when the radiation is turned off. The spectral analysis is more convenient also because in such\nsystems the dynamics is experimentally better studied in frequency rather than in time. The same kind of spectral\nanalysis of the nonlocal properties of a bipartite continuous variable system has been already applied in Ref. [27] which\ndemonstrated the EPR nonlocality between two optical beams of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier, following the\nsuggestion of [28].\nPerforming the Fourier transform of Eqs.

These criteria are inequalities which have to be satisfied by the product [14,29,30] or the sum [31,32]\nof variances of appropriate linear combinations of the rescaled position and momentum operators of the continuous\nvariable systems. These criteria are usually formulated in terms of Heisenberg operators at the same time instant,\nsatisfying the usual commutation relations [qj (t), pk (t)] = i\u03b4jk [29,31,32], but they can be adapted to their Fourier\ntransform, as long as the commutators between the frequency-dependent continuous variable operators are still a\nc-number [14]. This condition is satisfied in the present case thanks to the linearity of the Fourier transform and to\nthe linear dynamics of the fluctuations (see Eqs. (5)), implying that the commutators are always c-number frequencydependent functions.\nThe paradigmatic entangled state for continuous variable systems is the state considered by Einstein, Podolski and\nRosen in their famous paper [2], i.e., the simultaneous eigenstate of the relative distance q1 \u2212 q2 and of the total\nmomentum p1 + p2 . In an entangled state of this kind, the variances of these two operators are both small and it is\ntherefore natural to use them. Defining u = q1 \u2212 q2 and v = p1 + p2 , an inseparability criterion for the sum of the\nvariances in the case of arbitrary c-number commutators is [31]\nE\nE D\nD\n2\n2\n(9)\n(\u2206u) + (\u2206v) < 2|h[q1 , p1 ]i|2 ,\nwhile that for the product of variances is [14,29,30]\nE\nED\nD\n2\n2\n(\u2206v) < |h[q1 , p1 ]i|2 .\n(\u2206u)\n\n(10)\n\nIt is easy to see that the condition (9) implies condition (10), which means that the product criterion (10) is easier\nto satisfy, and for this reason we shall consider only the latter from now on. Furthermore, the product criterion (10)\nallows us to establish a connection with Refs. [28], which showed that when the inequality\nD\nED\nE 1\n2\n2\n(11)\n(\u2206u)\n(\u2206v) < |h[q1 , p1 ]i|2 ,\n4\nis satisfied, an EPR-like paradox arises [2,33], based on the inconsistency between quantum mechanics and local\nrealism, which has been then experimentally confirmed in [27]. The sufficient condition for inseparability of Eq. (10)\nis weaker than condition (11), but this is not surprising, since entangled states are only a necessary condition for the\nrealization of an EPR-like paradox (see however the recent paper [30] where it is shown that the weaker inseparability\nsufficient condition (10) can be considered as a marker of the existence of generalized, weaker, EPR correlations).\nIn order to apply the inseparability criterion (10) in the frequency domain, we have to make the frequency dependent\noperators qj (\u03c9) and pj (\u03c9) Hermitian, i.e., to consider the Hermitian component\nRO (\u03c9) =\n\nO(\u03c9) + O(\u2212\u03c9)\n2\n\n(12)\n\nfor any operator O(\u03c9). Using the fact that hqj (\u03c9)i = hpj (\u03c9)i = 0, j = 1, 2 and \u2200\u03c9 because they are associated to\nfluctuations around the semiclassical steady state, Eq. (10) therefore becomes\nhR2q1 \u2212q2 ihR2p1 +p2 i < |h[Rq1 , Rp1 ]i|2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhich suggests the following definition of degree of entanglement for the mechanical oscillation modes at frequency \u03c9\nof the two cavity mirrors [14]\nE(\u03c9) =\n\nhR2q1 \u2212q2 ihR2p1 +p2 i\n|h[Rq1 , Rp1 ]i|2\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\nwhich is a marker of entanglement whenever E(\u03c9) < 1.\nUsing Eqs. (8) it is possible to derive the analytic expression of E(\u03c9), which is however very cumbersome.

This is an important\nparameter because we have seen in [14] that in the case of identical mirrors, the two mechanical modes are entangled\nonly within a small bandwidth around the mechanical resonance. Since in practice the two mirrors will never be\nexactly identical, it is important to establish if the macroscopic entanglement is able to tolerate a certain amount\nof frequency mismatch. For the other parameter values we have considered an experimental situation comparable to\nthat of Refs. [20,22,34], where the studied mirror oscillation mode is a Gaussian acoustic mode. We have therefore\nconsidered a cavity driven by a laser working at \u03bb = 810 nm and power Pbin = 1 W, with length L = 1 mm, detuning\n\u2206b = 6 MHz, optical finesse F = 25000, yielding a cavity decay rate \u03b3b = 6 MHz. The mechanical modes have been\ntaken with effective mass m1 = m2 = 23 mg, damping rates \u03931 = \u03932 = 1 Hz, and \u03a91 = 1 MHz, while we have changed\nthe values of \u03a92 around those of \u03a91 . These choices yield for the optomechanical couplings G1 \u2243 G2 \u2243 2.5 Hz.\nFig. 2 shows E(\u03c9, T ) for no frequency mismatch, \u03a91 = \u03a92 , Fig. 3 refers to the case with \u03a92 \u2212 \u03a91 = 10 Hz, and\nFig. 4 refers to the case with \u03a92 \u2212 \u03a91 = 20 Hz. In all cases, the region of the \u03c9, T plane where the two mechanical\nmodes are entangled is centered in the middle of the two mechanical resonances, i.e., E(\u03c9, T ) always achieves its\nminimum at \u03c9 = (\u03a91 + \u03a92 )/2. The frequency bandwidth of the entanglement region rapidly decreases with increasing\ntemperature, so that, with the chosen parameter values, entanglement disappears above T \u2243 4 K. As expected, the\n\u03c9, T region where the two mirrors are entangled becomes smaller for increasing frequency mismatch (compare the\nthree figures). Nonetheless these results are extremely interesting because they clearly show the possibility to entangle\ntwo macroscopic oscillators (with an effective mass of 23 mg) in a stationary way, using present technology. In fact,\nthe two modes are still clearly entangled at T = 2 K and with \u03a92 \u2212 \u03a91 = 10 Hz (ten times larger than the width of\nthe mechanical resonance peaks, see Fig. 3), while one is forced to go below T = 2 K when the frequency mismatch\nis equal to 20 Hz (see Fig. 4).\nDifferently from temperature and frequency mismatch, and as it can be seen from the involved analytical expression\nabove, it is difficult to determine how the degree of entanglement depends upon the other parameters. It can only\nbe verified that, as expected, entanglement improves with increasing mechanical quality factor Qj = \u03a9j /\u0393j and\nthat it strongly improves with increasing the effective optomechanical coupling constant, which is given by \u03b2Gj (see\nEqs. (5)). This shows that for achieving even a more macroscopic entanglement (i.e., larger masses), one has to use\nsmaller cavities and, above all, larger optical power. The fundamental importance of the effective coupling constant\n\u03b2Gj also helps us to show which kind of entangled state of the two mirrors is generated by the radiation pressure. In\nfact, when the cavity mode intensity becomes larger and larger, the optomechanical interaction tends to project the\ntwo mechanical modes onto an approximate eigenstate of G1 q1 \u2212 G2 q2 (see Eqs. (1) and (5)), which, since in our case\nit is G1 \u2243 G2 , is essentially equivalent to the relative distance q1 \u2212 q2 . The two oscillators occupy a state that, like\na standard EPR state, has a very small variance of the relative distance u = q1 \u2212 q2 . On the other hand, since the\nradiation pressure does not have analogous effects\nD on Ethe total momentum v = p1 + p2 , the state of the mirrors does\n2\nnot exhibit such a small value for the variance (\u2206v) as the standard EPR state does. Nonetheless, at large optical\nintensities, as shown by the product criterion of Eq. (10), the effect of the radiation pressure force on the relative\ndistance is sufficient to entangle the two macroscopic oscillator modes. Moreover, as it can be seen from Figs. 2-4, the\ndegree of entanglement E(\u03c9) lies even below 1/4 at sufficiently low temperatures, allowing therefore in principle also\nan experimental test of EPR nonlocality with macroscopic oscillators, on the basis of the inequality (11) of Refs. [28].\n\n5\n\n\fIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown how the optomechanical coupling realized by the radiation pressure of an optical mode of a ring\ncavity is able to entangle two macroscopic collective oscillation modes of two cavity mirrors. Using parameter values\ncorresponding to already performed experiments involving an optical cavity mode coupled to an acoustic mode of the\nmirror (with an effective mass of many milligrams) we have shown that an appreciable entanglement is achievable at\ntemperatures of some Kelvin. This continuous variable entanglement is established at a given frequency, between the\nspectrally decomposed oscillation modes of the two mirrors (see also Refs. [27,28] for an analogous spectral analysis\nof the nonlocal properties of the beams of a nondegenerate optical amplifier). One has a stationary entanglement,\nwhich is maintained by the strongly driven cavity mode as long as it is turned on. Using the degree of entanglement\nE(\u03c9) of Eq. (14), suggested by the inseparability condition of Eq. (10), we have seen that the entanglement is more\nrobust when the two mechanical resonance frequencies are equal (Fig. 2), but that it tolerates a resonance frequency\nmismatch of tens of Hz, much larger than the width of the resonance peaks. The best entanglement is always achieved\nin the middle of the two mechanical resonances and the frequency bandwidth of the entanglement parameter region\nrapidly decreases with decreasing optomechanical coupling and increasing temperatures.\nThis continuous variable entanglement between two macroscopic collective degrees of freedom can be experimentally\nmeasured using for example the three-cavity scheme described in detail in [14]. In such a scheme, a ring cavity is\nsupplemented with two other external cavities, each measuring the spectral components qj (\u03c9) and pj (\u03c9) of each\nmirror oscillation mode via homodyne detection. With these measurements, it is possible to obtain both variances\nhR2q1 \u2212q2 i and hR2p1 +p2 i. As it has been verified in [14], if the driving power of the meter cavities is much smaller\nthan the driving power of the \"entangler\" cavity mode, the two additional cavities do not significantly modify the\nentanglement dynamics. A simplified detection scheme, involving less than three cavities is currently investigated. In\nfact, the homodyne detection of the entangler mode b provides direct information on the relative distance between the\nmirror modes q1 \u2212 q2 . The measurement of the total momentum quadrature p1 + p2 could be then achieved using the\nresult of this homodyne detection and that of the homodyne measurement of the motion of a single mirror provided\nby a second \"meter\" cavity mode. It is however possible that an even simpler detection scheme exists, using the\nentangler cavity mode only.\nAnother important aspect which has to be taken into account is that the motion of each mirror is the superposition\nof many oscillation modes with different resonance frequencies. We can safely verify the entanglement between the two\nconsidered oscillation modes provided that the other modes of the two mirrors are sufficiently far away in frequency\nso that their contribution at the analysed frequencies is negligible. Moreover, the above analysis also applies, almost\nunmodified, to the case when the two modes belong to the same mirror.\nThe possibility to prepare entangled state of two macroscopic degrees of freedom is not only conceptually important\nfor better understanding the relation between the macroscopic world ruled by classical mechanics and the quantum\nmechanical microscopic substrate, but it may also prove to be useful for some applications. For example, Ref. [16] has\nshowed that entangled states of the kind studied here could improve the detection of weak mechanical forces acting\non the mirrors as those due to gravitational waves [35].\n\n[1] E.
