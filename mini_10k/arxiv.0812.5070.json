We demonstrate efficient transfer of ultracold molecules into a deeply\nbound rovibrational level of the singlet ground state potential in the presence of\nan optical lattice. The overall molecule creation efficiency is 25%, and the transfer\nefficiency to the rovibrational level |v = 73, J = 2 > is above 80%. We find that the\nmolecules in |v = 73, J = 2 > are trapped in the optical lattice, limited by optical\nexcitation by the lattice light. The molecule trapping time for a lattice depth of 15\natomic recoil energies is about 20 ms. We determine the trapping frequency by the\nlattice phase and amplitude modulation technique. It will now be possible to transfer\nthe molecules to the rovibrational ground state |v = 0, J = 0> in the presence of the\noptical lattice.\n\n\fLattice-based ground state transfer\n\n2\n\n1. Introduction\nThe generation of molecular quantum gases and molecular Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BEC) has been a major goal for the field of atomic and molecular physics. It has\nbeen achieved for the case of two fermionic atoms that pair up to form a bosonic dimer\nmolecule in the limit of vanishing binding energy [1, 2] at ultralow temperatures. In\nthis limit, collisional stability is assured, and this has allowed the investigation of the\nBEC-BCS crossover [3]. Here, we are interested in the opposite limit of deeply bound\nmolecules. Collisional stability is expected only for the rovibronic ground state, and\nmost likely it will be necessary that one prepares the lowest molecular hyperfine sublevel\n[4] to avoid hyperfine changing collisions. Our approach to producing a quantum gas\nof ground state molecules is based on laser cooling of atoms to the point of quantum\ndegeneracy, followed by molecule association on a Feshbach resonance and subsequent\ncoherent two-photon molecule transfer [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In principle, this approach\ncombines high molecular densities and ultralow temperatures with full state selectivity.\nFor optimization of both the initial molecule creation process and the transfer process,\nthe use of a three-dimensional optical lattice has been proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 1\nC. In a superfluid-to-Mott-insulator phase transition doubly occupied lattice sites can be\nfavored [11, 12], and collisional relaxation during the transfer can, at least in principle,\nbe fully avoided. It should be possible that one finally creates a molecular BEC by\ndynamical melting of the lattice after the two-photon transfer [13].\nIn the present work, we report on two-photon transfer into a deeply bound\nrovibrational level by means of the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)\ntechnique [14, 8] in the presence of a three-dimensional optical lattice. We extend our\nprevious work of transfering molecules to rovibrational level |v = 73, J = 2 > of the\n1 +\n\u03a3g electronic ground state in the quantum gas regime [5] by first using the superfluidto-Mott-insulator phase transition to efficiently produce pairs of atoms at the wells of\nthe lattice. The pairs are then associated to weakly bound molecules on a Feshbach\nresonance. Subsequently, the molecules are transferred by magnetic field ramping to\nthe starting state for optical transfer. From there, they are efficiently transferred to the\ndeeply bound rovibrational level |v = 73, J = 2 > by means of STIRAP. Fig. 1 A shows\nthe relevant molecular states for the Cs dimer molecule and the transitions involved.\nWe find that the molecules in |v = 73, J = 2 > are trapped in the lattice with a 1/etrapping time of about 20 ms, limited by scattering of lattice light. We measure the\ntrapping frequency of the molecules in the lattice and find that the polarizability in\n|v = 73, J = 2 > is about 30% that of the Feshbach molecules. It will now be possible\nthat one adds a second STIRAP transfer step the reach the rovibronic ground state\n|v = 0, J = 0 >, giving full quantum control over the external and internal degrees of\nfreedom for the molecules.\n\n\fLattice-based ground state transfer\n\n3\n\n2. Preparation of Feshbach molecules in the optical lattice\nTo produce an ultracold sample of Feshbach molecules trapped at the individual sites\nof an optical lattice we first produce an atomic BEC with typically 1 \u00d7 105 Cs atoms in\nthe lowest hyperfine sublevel F = 3, mF = 3 in a crossed optical dipole trap. As usual,\nF is the atomic angular momentum quantum number, and mF its projection on the\nmagnetic field axis. For BEC production, we essentially follow the procedure detailed\nin Ref.[15]. We set the atomic scattering length to a value of 210 a0 , where a0 is Bohr's\nradius, by tuning the magnetic offset field to 2.1 mT. At this value, three-body losses are\nminimal [16]. We then drive the superfluid-to-Mott-insulator phase transition [17] by\nexponentially ramping up the power in a three-dimensional optical lattice within about\n400 ms while simultaneously ramping up the harmonic confinement in the dipole trap.\nThe lattice is generated by three mutually orthogonal, retro-reflected laser beams at a\nwavelength of \u03bb = 1064.5 nm, each with a 1/e-waist of about 350 \u03bcm. For the atoms, we\nachieve a well depth of up to 40 ER , where ER = h2 /(2m\u03bb2 ) = kB \u00d764 nK is the atomic\nphoton recoil energy with the mass m of the Cs atom. h is Planck's constant, and kB\nis Boltzmann's constant. Throughout the paper we give lattice depths in units of the\natomic recoil energy. The lattice light as well as the light for the dipole trap beams\nis derived from a single-frequency, narrow-band, highly-stable Nd:YAG laser that is\namplified to up to 20 W without spectral degradation in a home-built fiber amplifier [18].\nThe power in each lattice beam is controlled by an acousto-optical intensity modulator\nand an intensity stabilization servo. While ramping up the lattice potential, the power\nin the two dipole trap beams is increased to assure that the central density in the trap\nis sufficiently high to allow the preferential formation of atom pairs at the central wells\nof the lattice, but not too high to lead to triply occupied sites. We typically ramp\nthe lattice to a depth of 15 to 25 ER . Typically about 30% of the atoms reside at\ndoubly occupied lattice sites. We estimate this number from the molecule production\nefficiency. This value is not optimal yet, as loading from a parabolic potential should\ngive a maximum of 53% [12, 19].\nWe now produce Feshbach molecules on a Feshbach resonance [20, 21, 22] near a\nmagnetic field value of B = 1.98 mT [23] in the presence of the optical lattice [24, 11].\nFig. 1 B shows the relevant weakly bound Feshbach levels. The resonance at 1.98 mT\nis quite narrow, but it lies at a conveniently low value of the magnetic field, allowing us\nto simply lower the magnetic offset field from the BEC production value and ramp over\nthe resonance with a rate of about 0.006 T/s. The molecules produced are then in level\n|g >. These molecules have g-wave character, i.e. ` = 4, where ` is the quantum number\nassociated with the mechanical rotation of the nuclei [25]. After association, atoms\nremaining at singly occupied lattice sites are removed by microwave transfer to F = 4\nand a resonant light pulse. Starting from level |g > we have recently identified transitions\n3\n+\nto deeply bound excited rovibrational levels of the Cs2 mixed (A1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212b \u03a0u ) 0u excited\nstates [7]. These transitions should allow STIRAP transfer to the target rovibrational\nlevel |v = 73, J = 2 > of the electronic ground state, but for the present work we have\n\n\fLattice-based ground state transfer\n\n4\n\ndecided to use Feshbach level |s > as the starting state as in our previous work [5]\nso that the transfer performances with and without the presence of the lattice can\nbe compared. To reach level |s > from level |g >, we have implemented Feshbach state\ntransfer as realized in Ref.[23] using a combination of slow and fast magnetic field ramps.\nIn brief, we first transfer the molecules from |g > to level |g2 > by lowering the magnetic\nfield B sufficiently slowly to a value of 1.22 mT, thereby following the upper branch of\nan avoided crossing near 1.33 mT as shown in Fig. 1 B. We then increase B abruptly to\na value of 1.67 mT, thereby jumping the two crossings with levels |g > and |l >. The\nmaximum magnetic field rate of change is \u223c 2000 T/s. We finally follow slowly on the\nupper branch of the avoided crossing with |s > at 1.85 mT, stopping at B = 1.9 mT. Our\nprocedure allows us to essentially transfer all molecules from |g > to |s >. For molecule\ndetection, we reverse the magnetic field ramps to level |g >, dissociate the molecules at\nthe Feshbach resonance at B = 1.98 mT and detect the resulting atoms by standard\nabsorption imaging [21].\nFor comparison with our data obtained below we first measure the lifetime of the\nweakly-bound Feshbach molecules in the optical lattice. Typical lifetime measurements\nfor these molecules are shown in Fig. 2 A-C. In such measurements, we record the number\nof remaining molecules as a function of hold time in the lattice. The lifetime of the\nmolecules depends strongly on which Feshbach level is used and on the value of the\nmagnetic field B. For example, for molecules in level |g > at B = 1.82 mT the lifetime is\n1.8 s at a lattice depth of 15 ER , while in level |s > the lifetime is 0.09 s at B = 1.9 mT\nand 10 s at B = 2.9 mT for the same lattice depth. We attribute this strong dependence\nof the lifetime of molecules in |s > to the fact that the molecular character changes\nstrongly from being predominantly closed channel dominated to being open channel\ndominated as the magnetic field is increased [22], reducing wave function overlap with\nexcited molecular levels. We always determine the lifetime for two values of the lattice\ndepth, 15 ER and 25 ER . In all cases, the lifetime is reduced for higher lattice depth,\nindicating residual optical excitation by the lattice light. Nevertheless, the long lifetimes\nreflect the fact that the lattice perfectly shields the molecules from inelastic moleculemolecule collisions, which would otherwise limit the lifetime to a few ms at the given\nmolecular densities [24].\n3. Lattice-based STIRAP transfer\nWe implement two-photon STIRAP transfer to the deeply bound rovibrational level\n|3 >= |v = 73, J = 2 > of the 1 \u03a3+\ng electronic ground state potential in a similar way as\nin our previous work [5], except that now the molecules are trapped at the individual\nwells of the optical lattice. In brief, laser L1 near a wavelength of 1126 nm, driving\nthe transition from |1 >= |s > to |2 >, where |2 > is a deeply bound level of the mixed\n3\n+\n(A1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212b \u03a0u ) 0u excited states, is pulsed on after laser L2 , which drives the transition\nfrom |3 > to |2 > at 1006 nm, see Fig. 1 A. The pulse (or pulse overlap) time \u03c4p is\ntypically \u03c4p = 10 \u03bcs for the present experiments. A schematic time course for the\n\n\fLattice-based ground state transfer\n\n5\n\ntransition Rabi frequencies is shown in Fig. 3 C. We estimate the peak Rabi frequencies\nto be 2\u03c0 \u00d7 3 MHz for the transition at 1126 nm and 2\u03c0 \u00d7 6 MHz for the transition at\n1006 nm [5]. After a variable hold time \u03c4h , we reverse the pulse sequence to transfer\nthe molecules back to |s >. For short \u03c4h below 40 \u03bcs we typically leave L1 on between\nthe two STIRAP pulse sequences. For longer \u03c4h we switch L1 off to avoid any residual\noptical excitation of molecules in |v = 73, J = 2 > and possible effects of dipole forces\ngenerated by the tightly focused laser beam L1 .\nThe result of double STIRAP transfer in the optical lattice is shown in Fig. 3\nA. Here, \u03c4p = 10 \u03bcs and \u03c4h = 15 \u03bcs. As before, we interrupt the transfer after a\ngiven STIRAP time \u03c4S and record the number of molecules in the initial state |s >.\nThe molecules first disappear, and then a sizable fraction of about 65% returns after\nthe reverse STIRAP transfer. Thus, as in our previous work [5], the single pass\nefficiency is about 80% when both lasers are on resonance. Fig. 3 B shows the double\nSTIRAP transfer efficiency as a function of the detuning \u22062 of laser L2 from the excited\nintermediate level while laser L1 is held on resonance (detuning \u22061 \u2248 0). A Gaussian\nfit yields a full width at half maximum of 830 kHz. With \u03c4p so short, we do not resolve\nmolecular hyperfine structure in |v = 73, J = 2 >.\nWe find that the molecules transferred to |v = 73, J = 2 > are trapped at the\nindividual wells of the lattice. The 1/e-lifetime is about 19 ms for a lattice depth of\n15 ER . This is much shorter than the lifetime of Feshbach molecules as shown above,\nbut sufficiently long to allow future implementation of a second lattice-based STIRAP\nstep to the rovibronic ground state |v = 0, J = 0 >, for which the lifetime is expected\nto be much longer as discussed below. We determine the lifetime by repeating the\ndouble STIRAP transfer while increasing the hold time \u03c4h in steps of 3.5 ms. The\nresult is shown in Fig. 2 D. The number of molecules can be well fit by an exponentially\ndecaying function as a function of \u03c4h . For a higher lattice depth of 25 ER , the lifetime\nis reduced to 15 ms. We thus attribute the reduced molecular lifetime to off-resonant\n3\n+\nscattering of lattice light, exciting the molecules to levels of the (A1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212b \u03a0u ) 0u states,\nwhich then in turn leads to loss into other ground state rovibrational levels that we do\nnot detect.\n4. Determination of molecule trapping parameters\nWe determine the molecular trapping frequency \u03c9|v=73> for molecules in |v = 73, J = 2 >\nby modulating the lattice phase and, alternatively, by modulating the lattice amplitude.\nIn the first case, we primarily excite transitions from the lowest band in the lattice to the\nfirst excited band and then to higher bands. In the second case, we primarily excite into\nthe second excited band and then to higher bands. For sufficiently strong modulation,\nmolecules are lost from the lattice, as tunneling to neighboring sites and hence inelastic\ncollisions with neighboring molecules become more probable. We thus expect to detect\nincreased molecular loss if the modulation frequency is tuned into resonance with the\ninter-band transitions. The results are shown in Fig. 4. At a lattice depth of 15 ER ,\n\n\fLattice-based ground state transfer\n\n6\n\nwe observe resonant loss at 5.2 kHz in the case of phase modulation and at 10.1 kHz\nin the case of amplitude modulation of the lattice. Phase modulation at 22 ER and\namplitude modulation at 20 ER yield resonances at 6.5 kHz and 12.2 kHz, respectively.\nThese values for different trap depths are consistent with each other when compared\nwith a calculation of the band structure. For comparison, to determine the trapping\nfrequency \u03c9F of the Feshbach molecules in level |g>, we measure that phase modulation\n(amplitude modulation) of a 15 ER deep lattice leads to loss at a modulation frequency\nof 9.4 kHz (18.4 kHz). Relating the dynamical polarizability \u03b1|v=73> of the deeply bound\nmolecules in v = 73 to the dynamical polarizability \u03b1F of the Feshbach molecules via\n2\n\u03b1|v=73> /\u03b1F = \u03c9|v=73>\n/\u03c9F2 , we obtain that the molecular polarizability in |v = 73, J = 2 >\nis \u223c 30% of the polarizability of the Feshbach molecules at the wavelength of our\ntrapping light. Note that in the wavelength region of our trapping laser, this value is\nexpected to show strong variations as a function of trapping laser wavelength due to the\n3\n+\npresence of levels of the (A1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212b \u03a0u ) 0u states.\n5. Conclusion\nWe have transferred an ultracold sample of Cs2 molecules to the deeply bound\nrovibrational level |v = 73, J = 2 > of the singlet X1 \u03a3+\ng potential in the presence of\nan optical lattice. We essentially find the same transfer efficiency as in our previous\nwork [5] where no lattice was used. The transferred molecules are trapped, and we have\ndetermined their polarizability in this particular level. The trapping time is sufficiently\nlong to allow for subsequent lattice-based STIRAP transfer to the rovibronic ground\nstate |v = 0, J = 0 > by means of a second two-photon transition [6]. A lower bound\nfor the STIRAP pulse time and hence for the minimal required trapping time is set by\nthe time needed to resolve the molecular hyperfine structure. This minimal time is the\ninverse of three times the ground state hyperfine coupling constant c4 \u2248 14 kHz [4],\ngiving 24 \u03bcs. Hence a compromise can easily be found between Fourier-resolving the\nmolecular hyperfine structure and keeping the STIRAP pulse time sufficiently short\nin view of finite laser coherence time and finite trapping time. For Cs2 molecules\nin the rovibronic ground state |v = 0, J = 0 > we expect much longer trapping\ntimes in the lattice as optical excitation at 1064.5 nm into excited molecular states\ncan only occur in a far off-resonant process. At this wavelength transitions to the\n3\n+\n(A1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212b \u03a0u ) 0u states are relevant. These are possible only to levels that have a sizable\n+\nsinglet contribution stemming from the A1 \u03a3+\nu state. 0u levels below the minimum of\nthe A1 \u03a3+\nu state, corresponding to a wavelength of \u223c 1041 nm as measured from the\nrovibronic ground state [26], have little singlet component and hence these transitions\nare strongly suppressed. We thus expect the formation of a stable molecular quantum\ngas in |v = 0, J = 0 > when the lattice depth is lowered and the molecules are released into\na larger-volume optical dipole trap, possibly allowing the observation of Bose-Einstein\ncondensation of ground state molecules.\n\n\fLattice-based ground state transfer\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are indebted to R.

Molecules in a weakly bound Feshbach\nlevel |1> are transferred to rovibrational level |3>= |v = 73, J = 2> of the singlet X1 \u03a3+\ng\npotential in the presence of an optical lattice. Level |3> with a binding energy of 1061\ncm\u22121 is reached in a two-photon STIRAP process with wavelengths near 1126 nm and\n3\n+\n1006 nm via the 225th level of the electronically excited (A1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212b \u03a0u ) 0u potentials.\nThe X1 \u03a3+\ng potential has about 155 vibrational levels. B Zeeman diagram showing the\nenergy of all relevant weakly bound molecular levels for initial Feshbach molecular state\npreparation [23]. The binding energy is given with respect to the F = 3, mF = 3 twoatom asymptote. The molecules are first produced on a g-wave Feshbach resonance\nat 1.98 mT in state |g > (1). Residual atoms are removed by a combined microwave\nand resonant light pulse (2). The molecules are then transferred to the weakly bound\ns-wave state |1>= |s> (6), the starting state for the STIRAP transfer, via three avoided\nstate crossings involving state |g2> by slow (3,5) and fast magnetic field ramps (4).

Trapping of deeply bound molecules in the wells of the optical lattice. While\nthe molecules reside in level |3>= |v = 73, J = 2>, one of the lattice beams of the 3\ndimensional optical lattice is either phase modulated (A and B) or amplitude modulated\n(C and D). As the frequency of the phase or amplitude modulation is scanned, a series\nof resonances due to transfer to higher bands arise, reflected in a decrease in molecule\nnumber. The respective resonances at the lowest modulation frequency are shown here.\nFor phase modulation (\"shaking\" of the lattice), this corresponds to the first lattice\nband, for amplitude modulation to the second band. To determine the center frequency,\nthe resonances are fit by a Gaussian. The lattice depth is 15 ER , 22 ER , 15 ER , and 20\nER in A, B, C, and D, respectively.\n\n\fLattice-based ground state transfer\n\n12\n\nReferences\n[1] Jochim S, Bartenstein M, Altmeyer A, Hendl G, Riedl S, Chin C, Hecker Denschlag J and Grimm\nR 2003 Science 302 2101\n[2] Greiner M, Regal C A and Jin D S 2003 Nature 426 537\n[3] For an overview, see: Ultracold Fermi Gases, Proceedings of the International School of Physics\nEnrico Fermi, Course CLXIV, edited by Inguscio M, Ketterle W and Salomon C (IOS Press,\nAmsterdam, 2008)\n[4] Aldegunde J and Hutson J M 2008, preprint at arXiv:0810.4709\n[5] Danzl J G, Haller E, Gustavsson M, Mark M J, Hart R, Bouloufa N, Dulieu O, Ritsch H and\nN\u00e4gerl H-C 2008 Science 321 1062, published online 10 July 2008; 10.1126/science.1159909\n[6] Mark M J, Danzl J G, Haller E, Gustavsson M, Bouloufa N, Dulieu O, Salami H, Bergeman\nT, Ritsch H, Hart R and N\u00e4gerl H-C 2008 manuscript submitted for publication, preprint at\narXiv:0811.0695\n[7] Danzl J G, Mark M J, Haller E, Gustavsson M, Bouloufa N, Dulieu O, Ritsch H, Hart R and\nN\u00e4gerl H C 2008 manuscript submitted for publication, preprint at arXiv:0811.2374\n[8] Winkler K, Lang F, Thalhammer G, Straten P v d, Grimm R and Hecker Denschlag J 2007 Phys.\nRev.
