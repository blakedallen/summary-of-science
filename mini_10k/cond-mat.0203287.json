The physics of the incompressible state proposed\nhere involves p-wave pairing of composite fermions in the spin reversed sector. The temperature\nand magnetic field regimes for the realization of this state are estimated.\n71.10.Pm,73.40.Hm\n\nThe absence of fractional quantum Hall effect at the\nsimplest even denominator fraction, \u03bd = 1/2, continued\nto be an enigma for a decade after the discovery of the\nfractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), [1] but found a\nnatural explanation [2,3] in the framework of the composite fermion (CF) theory of the FQHE. [4,5] The sequence\nn\n\u03bd = 2n\u00b11\n, corresponding to the integral quantum Hall effect of composite fermions carrying two vortices (denoted\nby 2 CFs) at \u03bd \u2217 = n, converges to \u03bd = 1/2 in the limit\nn \u2192 \u221e. At least for a model of non-interacting composite fermions, a gapless Fermi sea of composite fermions is\nobtained here, for which good experimental support exists. [6] A FQHE at \u03bd = 1/2 is not ruled out in principle,\nthough; it may occur if, due to the residual inter-CF interaction, the CF Fermi sea should become unstable into\nan incompressible state as the temperature is lowered.\nThere is, however, no experimental evidence at present\nfor such an instability at \u03bd = 1/2.\nOne might expect similar physics at the half filled second Landau level (LL), \u03bd = 5/2, but a FQHE is observed\nhere instead. [7,8] The most promising proposal for the\nphysical origin of the FQHE at \u03bd = 5/2 is based on a pwave pairing of composite fermions, [9\u201315] described by\na BCS-like Pfaffian wave function of Moore and Read [9].\nIn spite of the intuitive appeal and theoretical support of\nthis idea, further experimental tests of its consequences\nare crucial for its establishment. [16] The difference between \u03bd = 1/2 and \u03bd = 5/2 lies in the interaction matrix elements, i.e. the Haldane pseudopotentials. [17] A\nstrong short range repulsion between electrons produces\na Fermi sea of composite fermions, but when the interaction becomes weakly repulsive at short distances, as\nin the second LL, it produces an effective attractive interaction between composite fermions, causing a pairing\ninstability of the CF Fermi sea [15]. For an attractive interaction between electrons, either a charge-density-wave\n(CDW) phase [18] or a spin-singlet FQHE state [19] becomes relevant, depending on parameters. The p-wave\npairing between composite fermions thus seems to be favored when the interparticle interaction is weakly repulsive at short distances.\n\nAn example of weakly interacting fermions is composite fermions themselves. This raises the natural question if they could ever do what electrons do at \u03bd = 5/2,\nnamely put on (additional) vortices and pair up to produce FQHE. After a careful consideration of a wide range\nof possibilities, we have concluded that the best candidate is at CF filling of \u03bd \u2217 = 1 + 1/2, when the 0\u2191 Landau\nlevel of 2 CFs is fully occupied and the 0\u2193 2 CF Landau\nlevel is half filled, as shown schematically in the inset\nof Fig. (1). This corresponds to a partially polarized\nstate at \u03bd = 3/8. The reason why this system is a good\ncandidate for pairing is because the CF-CF interaction\nhere is weakly repulsive at short distances, the origin\nof which can be understood intuitively following an argument by Nakajima and Aoki. [20] The Haldane pseudopotentials for composite fermions, VmCF , are expected\nto be related to the electron pseudopotentials in the lowelec\nest LL, Vmelec , approximately according to VmCF \u221d Vm+2p\n,\nbecause a capture of 2p vortices by electrons shifts the\nrelative angular momentum of any pair by 2p units. The\nstrong short-range repulsion is thus eliminated when electrons transform into composite fermions. [21] Below we\ndescribe our investigations that indeed support the possibility of a p-wave pairing of composite fermions in the\nspin reversed sector.\nThe spatial part of the wave function of the electronic\nstate at \u03bd = 3/8 is written as:\n\u03a8 83 = J 2 \u03c6\u21911 [{wr }]\u03c6\u21931/2 [{zi }]\n\nJ2 =\n\nN\u2191\nY\n\n(wr \u2212 ws )2\n\nr<s\n\nN\u2193\nY\ni<j\n\n(1)\n\nN\u2193 ,N\u2191\n\n(zi \u2212 zj )2\n\nY\ni,r\n\n(wr \u2212 zi )2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere wr = xr \u2212 iyr and zj = xj \u2212 iyj refer to the coordinates of the electrons with up and down spins, respectively. The full wave function is written by multiplying\nby the appropriate spin part followed by antisymmetrization. It has spin polarization (N\u2191 \u2212N\u2193 )/(N\u2191 +N\u2193 ) = 1/3,\nand can be shown to be an eigenstate of the total spin\n[22,12] with S = Sz .\n1\n\n\fThe factor \u03c6\u21911 [{wr }] is the wave function for the completely occupied lowest Landau level. Different states at\n\u03bd = 3/8 correspond to different choices for \u03c6\u21931/2 [{zi }] For\nthe Fermi sea state at \u03bd = 3/8, \u03a8F3 S , we take in Eq. (1)\n\nsystem size for this state is 10 particles in the spherical geometry, where the Hilbert space is already prohibitively large for an exact diagonalization study. To\nmake progress, we treat the filled 0\u2191 2 CF Landau level\nas inert, and map the problem of composite fermions at\n\u03bd \u2217 = 1 + 1/2 into fermions at half filling. The advantage\nof this method is that only the reversed spin composite fermions in the 0\u2193 2 CF-LL are considered explicitly,\nwhich reduces the size of the Hilbert space considerably.\nGiven the strongly correlated nature of the problem, the\neffective 2 CF-2 CF interaction is complicated and is expected to contain two, three, and higher body terms. In\norder to proceed, we neglect all but the two body term;\ni.e., we assume that the three and higher body terms do\nnot cause any phase transition. This approximate treatment of the effective interaction between these composite fermions is the most serious limitation of our model.\nThe physics of the problem suggests the following CFCF interaction. Consider two electrons in the lowest LL.\nAttaching 2p vortices to each electron modifies the interaction in three ways: i) The charge is reduced by a factor\n(2p + 1)\u22121 . ii) The effective magnetic field seen by CFs\n1\nincreases the magnetic length by a factor (2p + 1) 2 . iii)\nThe model pseudopotentials have their relative angular\nmomentum shifted by 2p. This motivates the following\nmodel, similar to the one used previously for an investigation of the spin wave dispersion at \u03bd = 1/3: [20]\n\n8\n\n\u03c6\u21931/2 [{zi }] = PLLL\n\nY\nj<k\n\n(zj \u2212 zk )2 \u03c6\u2193\u221e [{zi }]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2193\u221e is the Fermi sea wave function of electrons in\nzero magnetic field and PLLL is the lowest Landau level\nprojection operator. The Pfaffian state, \u03a8P3 f , is obtained\n8\n\nwith the choice [9]\n\u03c6\u21931/2 [{zi }] =\n\nY\nj<k\n\n(zj \u2212 zk )2 P f (M \u2193 )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere P f (M \u2193 ) is the Pfaffian of the N\u2193 \u00d7 N\u2193 antisym\u2193\nmetric matrix M \u2193 with components Mj,k\n= (zj \u2212 zk )\u22121 ,\n\u2193\ndefined as P f (M ) \u221d A[M12 M34 ...MN\u2193 \u22121,N\u2193 ], A being\nthe antisymmetrization operator. P f (M \u2193 ) is a real space\nBCS wave function and \u03c6\u21931/2 can therefore be viewed as a\np-wave paired quantum Hall state of composite fermions.\nThese states not only have mixed spin, but also an\nadmixture of different flavors of composite fermions, [23]\nthose carrying 2 and 4 vortices, called 2 CFs and 4 CFs,\nrespectively. In the first case, 2 CFs capture two additional vortices to convert into 4 CFs, which effectively experience no magnetic field and form a Fermi sea. In the\nsecond case, the 2 CFs capture two additional vortices to\nconvert into 4 CFs, which form pairs; a gap opens up due\nto pairing and FQHE results. The wave functions above\ncan be interpreted as describing Fermi sea and paired\nstates of spin-down 4 CFs in the background of spin-up\n2\nCFs.\nTo check which state is energetically superior, we use\nthe explicit analytical expressions for the lowest LL projected wave functions for composite fermions [24,5] and\nperform 2N dimensional integrals using Monte Carlo to\nobtain their Coulomb energy. We map the states onto the\nsurface of a sphere [17] and calculate the energy of each\nstate in the thermodynamic limit using a least squares fit.\nFig. (1) shows that while both the paired state and the\nFermi sea have energies quite comparable to those of the\nfully polarized states at 1/3 and 2/5 (-0.4098 and -0.4328\ne2 /\u01ebl, respectively [24,5]), the former is favored over the\nlatter. The energy difference is reduced by approximately\nan order of magnitude as compared to the analogous difference at 5/2, [12] indicative of a substantially weaker\ninteraction between the composite fermions.\nThough consistent with pairing within the spin-down\nsector, the variational nature of the preceding result does\nnot rule out other ground states. One way to ascertain\nthe validity of \u03a8P3 f would be to compare it with exact\n8\nresults for small systems. Unfortunately, the smallest\n\nVmelec\nV CF\n\u2217\n= 2m\n\u22172\n\u2217\ne /\u01ebl\ne /\u01ebl0\n\n(5)\n\n\u221a\ne\n, and l\u2217 = l0 2p + 1.\nwhere m\u2217 = m + 2p, e\u2217 = 2p+1\nA comparison with the pseudopotentials obtained directly from the microscopic wave functions, following the\nmethod of Refs. [25,26], demonstrates that the above\nmodel is surprisingly accurate. It should be noted\nthat this model is valid only for spin-reversed composite fermions on top of the 1/3 state; in general, the more\ncomplicated method of Refs. [25,26] must be used. [21]\nWith the above effective interaction between the spindown composite fermions, we carry out exact diagonalization to look for pairing correlations within the 0\u2193 2 CF\nLL. To begin with, we find a uniform (L = 0) ground\nstate at the flux 2Q = 2N\u2193 \u2212 3, which corresponds to the\nPfaffian wave function, for N\u2193 = 8, 10, 14 and 16. [27]\nNext we compare the ground state to the Pfaffian wave\nfunction, which is obtained by diagonalizing an interaction (containing three body terms) for which the Pfaffian\nwave function is the only zero energy eigenstate. The\noverlaps between the ground state of the V CF interaction (which we identify with the 3/8 state here) and the\nPfaffian wave function are given in Table I; for comparison, the overlaps between the ground state at 1/2 filling\nin the second electronic Landau level (identified with 5/2)\nand the Pfaffian are also given. While the overlaps are\nnot as decisively large as those between the filled CF-LL\n2\n\n\fclotron energy of the composite fermion, ~\u03c9c\u2217 , defined\nas ~\u03c9c\u2217 = \u01eb1\u2191 \u2212 \u01eb0\u2193 where \u01eb1\u2191 and \u01eb0\u2193 are the Coulomb\nself energies for the additional composite fermion in the\n1\u2191 and 0\u2193 CF-LLs. It has been estimated from exact\ndiagonalization as well as CF wave functions [25,29,30]\n2\nthat ~\u03c9c\u2217 = 0.028 \u01eble 0 for the Coulomb interaction. The\ncondition favoring the addition of the spin reversed CF,\n~\u03c9c\u2217 > \u2206Z , is satisfied for B < 20T for parameters appropriate to GaAs. Many experimentally relevant effects\nlike finite thickness, LL mixing, or disorder have not been\nconsidered in this estimation, and also the problem of the\naddition of only a single composite fermion at \u03bd = 1/3\nhas been considered, but it nonetheless indicates that a\npartially polarized state at 3/8 may be possible in the accessible parameter regime. (We note that numerous partially or un-polarized FQHE states have been observed.\n[5])\nBefore concluding, it is worth noting how fantastically\ncomplex the proposed 3/8 paired state is when viewed in\nterms of electrons: first all electrons at \u03bd = 3/8 capture\ntwo vortices to become 2 CFs at \u03bd \u2217 = 1 + 1/2; then those\nin the half filled spin reversed 2 CF Landau level capture\ntwo additional vortices to transform into 4 CFs that see no\nmagnetic field; these would normally form a 4 CF Fermi\nsea, but the Fermi sea is unstable to pairing due to a\nweak residual attraction between the 4 CFs; pairing of\n4\nCFs opens up a gap to produce FQHE. An observation\nof FQHE at this even denominator fraction in the lowest\nLL, apart from being interesting in its own right, will\nprovide further support for pairing of composite fermions\nas a valid mechanism for FQHE.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants no.

We thank Seung-Yeop Lee for\nmany helpful discussions.\n\nwave functions and the exact ground states at the principal filling factors, [5] they are significant, and overall\nsupport the interpretation of the 3/8 state as a paired\nstate of composite fermions.\nTo address the issue of the robustness of the 3/8 paired\nstate, we have investigated its evolution in a model in\nwhich the first odd pseudopotential, V1CF , is replaced by\nV1model . As shown in Fig. (2), the state survives an \u223c8%\nchange in V1 in either direction. Based on the previous\ndiscussion, one would expect that on the large V1model\nside of the \"paired\" region (V1model /V1CF \u2248 1), the Fermi\nsea has the lowest energy, whereas the stripe phase is\nlikely on the small V1 side. We have confirmed this by\ncomparing the energies of the three states following the\nmethod of Ref. [26]. This points to the interesting possibility that a transition from the paired state to stripes\nor Fermi sea may be driven by a change of parameters,\nas was suggested at 5/2 as well. [14] It is noted that for\nthe fully spin polarized state at \u03bd = 3/8, where one must\nconsider half filled 1\u2191 2 CF Landau level, a similar model\nfor the CF-CF interaction appears to indicate the stripe\nphase. [26]\nAnother measure of the strength of a FQHE state is\nthe excitation gap. The lowest energy excitations of the\n3/8 state are expected to lie within the spin-down CF\nLL, because of the reduced effective interaction. Therefore, our effective model containing only spin-down composite fermions is also valid for low energy excitations.\nFig. (3) shows the low energy spectrum for 8, 10, 14, and\n16 particles for the effective interaction, V CF , obtained\nby the Lanczos method. The energy gap is on the order\n2\nof \u223c 0.0004 \u01eble 0 . While the smallest gap is not identical\nto the gap to creating a far separated particle-hole pair,\nwe expect both to be of similar magnitude. In an analogous study, Morf [11] estimated the gap at \u03bd = 5/2 to\n2\n2\nbe 0.02 \u01eble 0 . For a given density, the units \u01eble 0 differ by\np\na factor of 20/3 at 5/2 and 3/8, and the theoretical\nestimates for the 5/2 and 3/8 gaps differ by a factor of \u223c\n20 in constant units (e.g., mK). Experimentally, the gap\nat 5/2 is in the range 200-300 mK, [8,28] which would\nsuggest that the gap for the paired state at 3/8 might be\nin the range 10-15 mK, which is quite small but above\nthe lowest temperatures where FQHE experiments have\nbeen performed. [8] (Given that the 5/2 gap is a factor of\n3-5 smaller than the theoretical value, the number 10-15\nmK ought to be taken only as a crude estimate.)\nA sufficiently large Zeeman energy will eliminate a partially polarized ground state at \u03bd = 38 . In order to estimate the magnetic field range where the partially polarized state may be viable, let us consider the addition of a\nsingle composite fermion to the state in which all states\nof the 0\u2191 CF-LL are occupied. The composite fermion\ncan be added to either the 0\u2193 CF-LL or the 1\u2191 CF-LL.\nThe former is favorable so long as the Zeeman splitting\nenergy, \u2206Z = |g|\u03bcB B, is smaller than the effective cy3\n\n\f\u22120.4235\n1\n\n1.0\n\n\u22120.4240\n\nh \u03c9*\nc\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\u22120.4245\n\n01\n1\n0 1\n1\n0 1\n1\n0\n1\n01\n1\n0 1\n1\n01\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n11\n00\n111\n000\n11\n00\n01\n1\n0 000\n1\n0 1\n1\n0\n1\n01\n1\n0 1\n1\n000\n1\n0 000\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n111\n000\n111\n111\n000\n11\n111\n11\n00\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n11\n00\n111\n000\n11\n00\n01\n1\n0 000\n1\n0 1\n1\n0\n1\n01\n1\n0 1\n1\n000\n1\n0 000\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n111\n000\n111\n111\n000\n11\n111\n11\n00\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n01\n1\n0 1\n1\n0 1\n1\n0\n1\n01\n1\n0 1\n1\n01\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n11\n00\n0\n1\n11\n00\n0\n1\n11\n00\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n11\n00\n0\n1\n11\n00\n0\n1\n11\n00\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n11\n00\n0\n1\n11\n00\n0\n1\n11\n00\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n0\n\n\u2206Z\n\n0.8\n01\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n00\n1\n0\n1\n0 1\n1\n0\n1\n01\n1\n0\n1\n00\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n11\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n01\n1\n0\n1\n1\n00\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\u22120.424026(36)\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n11\n00\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nOverlap\n\nEnergy Per Particle [e /\u03b5l0]\n\n1\n\nFermi Sea State\nPaired State\n\n\u22120.4250\n\u22120.425512(32)\n\n0.6\nN=8\nN=10\nN=14\nN=16\n\n0.4\n\n\u22120.4255\n\n0.2\n\u22120.4260\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n1/N\n\n0.0\n0.8\n\nFIG. 1.
