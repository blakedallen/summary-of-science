Introduction\nIn recent years, a number of nebulae around symbiotic\nMiras has been discovered, and several planetary nebulae\n(PNe) have been found to have a symbiotic binary nucleus (Corradi et al. 1999a, 2000, and references therein).\nSymbiotic Miras are interacting binary systems consisting of a cool Mira and a hot companion, in most cases a\nwhite dwarf. A small fraction (about 1%) of the wind from\nthe Mira is accreted by the compact companion. The vast\nmajority of the Mira wind mass is ionized by the white\ndwarf and it forms a slowly expanding shell around the\nsystem. Many of those nebulae are extremely bipolar and\nhave high velocity outflow features. The nebulae around\nthis class of symbiotic Miras are very similar to PNe in\nterms of morphology, excitation conditions, and chemical\nabundances, but they are no genuine PNe, since the gas\nis donated by a star still on the asymptotic giant branch\nand ionized by the hot companion whose PN is already dispersed in the interstellar matter. Due to many similarities\nnebulae around symbiotic Miras are hard to distinguish\nfrom classical PNe using optical spectroscopy. In a diagnostic diagram used for gaseous nebulae (Garc\u0131\u0301a Lario et\nal. 1991) plotting the intensity of the [N ii] and [S ii] lines\nrelative to H\u03b1, all the symbiotic Miras from our sample\nlie exactly in the region of the PNe (Fig. 1). One big difference, however, are the near infrared (NIR) colours, as\nSend offprint requests to: S. Schmeja,\ne-mail: stefan.j.schmeja@uibk.ac.at\n\u22c6\nBased on observations collected at the European Southern\nObservatory, La Silla\n\nproposed by Whitelock & Munari (1992) using the JHK\nbands. In most cases direct evidence for a symbiotic binary\ncentral star still lacks: the cool (red) component is not visible, but detected by the modulation of the IR luminosity\n(e. g. He 2-104) or deduced from theoretical models (e. g.\nM 2-9). We finally are able to provide a tool to obtain the\nneeded separation by using a longer wavelength base (as\ngiven by DENIS). As sample all planetary nebulae with\nphotometry from the DENIS survey were taken. In addition, as \"prototype\" objects the known symbiotic Miras\nBI Cru, RX Pup, RR Tel, He 2-147, and H 1-36 have been\nobserved using attenuating filters.\n\n2. Observational Data\nDENIS (Deep Near Infrared Southern Sky Survey;\nEpchtein et al. 1997) is a project which aims to survey\nthe entire southern sky in the three near infrared bands\nGunn-I (0.82 \u03bcm), J (1.25 \u03bcm), and Ks (2.15 \u03bcm). The\nobservations are performed with the ESO 1 m telescope at\nLa Silla, Chile, which is fully dedicated to this project.\nIn a work on NIR photometry of PNe we obtained a\nsample of 134 PNe observed with DENIS (Schmeja &\nKimeswenger 2001). The investigated PNe show a wide variety of morphologies, diameters, and distances, forming a\npretty homogeneous sample. In any case, the flux from the\nwhole nebula was measured. Photometry using the high\nresolution images allowed us to remove the background\nsources and thus to reduce the stellar background contamination to a minimum. This is a major improvement\nto the aperture photometries of PNe done so far. They\n\n\f2\n\nS. Schmeja and S. Kimeswenger: PN or symbiotic Mira?\n2.5\n\nTable 1.

Spectral information is given in the literature.\noften suffered from contamination by very red or strongly\nreddened background sources. Fig. 2 shows He 2-147 as an\nexample how the field is contaminated by stars in normal\naperture photometers.\nFor the calibration of our photometries we used the DENIS\nonline zero points from La Silla, taking into account\na small offset to the values derived at the Paris Data\nAnalysis Centre (for details see Schmeja & Kimeswenger\n2001). The measured magnitudes were corrected for interstellar extinction using the extinction constants from the\nquick survey by Tylenda et al. (1992), except for He 2-25,\nTh 2-B, and 19W32, where we used the values given by\nCorradi (1995).\nOne of the main advantages of the DENIS instrument is\nthe beam splitter, taking all three bands at the same time.\nThis makes the colours independent from minor errors\ndue to changes of the atmospheric conditions. Moreover\nit gives us the colours of the objects independent from\n\nFig. 2. Contamination by background sources in aperture\nphotometries using typical diaphragm diameters of 20\u2032\u2032 in\nthe NIR - example of He 2-147 (DENIS I band).\n\nchanges due to the pulsation of the Mira. The instrument\nhas fixed exposure times, thus it is restricted to a given\nmagnitude range of 13.m 8 > Ks > 6.m 0 and 16.m 2 > J > 8.m 0.\nAdditional pointed observations of known symbiotic Miras\nhave been obtained on June 5th , 7th , and 8th 2001 with\nthe same instrument using 5.m 2 attenuating filters. For the\nsymbiotic Miras we used the interstellar extinction given\nby Whitelock (1987).\nThe larger PNe sample is given in Schmeja & Kimeswenger (2001). The values of the attenuated observations,\ntogether with values from the literature (Munari et al.\n1992) are given in Table 1. As the objects are Miras, variations at different epochs are expected.\n\n3. Discussion\nFig. 3 shows the dereddened NIR two-colour diagram of\nour sample of PNe. The photometric errors are about the\nsize of the symbols. A vector corresponding to a reddening of EB\u2212V = 1 is also shown. It indicates the direction\nthe objects would move in the diagram when increasing\nthe extinction values. The genuine PNe are located in a\nwell defined region in the diagram, roughly in the range\n0.m 0 . (I\u2013J)0 . 1.m 5 and -0.m 5 . (J\u2013K)0 . 1.m 5. Especially,\nthey are pretty well separated from the Miras, much better\nthan in JHK two-colour diagrams used in the past. This is\nprobably due to the longer wavelength base and the sensitivity of the I-band to non-thermal radiation. The known\nand suspected nebulae around symbiotic Miras, indicated\nwith their names, however show peculiar colours both in\n(I\u2013J)0 and in (J\u2013K)0 . They are in part quite far away from\nthe bulk of other PNe, as well as from the classical Miras\n(except 19W32). So, the colours do not only represent the\ncool component. Whitelock (1987) showed that \"classical\" symbiotic Miras have colours (J\u2013K) > 1.m 6. This is\nalso valid for those symbiotic Miras with PN-like nebulae in our sample. The model of Whitelock (1987) uses a\n2500 K star and a 800 K enevlope with a circumstellar\nextinction starting at AK \u2248 0.m 3 for RX Pup and reaching\nup to 1.m 5. This simple extinction+cold emission model\ndescribes the 1-5 \u03bcm colours well. Such a circumstellar extinction would lead to a circumstellar reddening of at least\nthe same amount in case of (I\u2013J). However, we find out\ncolours that are even bluer than those of classical Miras,\nso a modification of this view is needed. Also the spread\nin (I\u2013J) is significantly higher than that in the pure NIR\ncolour diagram. The (I\u2013J) is therefore giving the signa-\n\n\fS. Schmeja and S.

The more the object has an evolved\nnebula, the more it moves to the upper left section of the\ndiagram but not towards the normal PNe. Thus it is also\nnot just a stronger hot star+nebula. This is also valid for\nthe objects H 1-36 and He 2-104 from the sample of \"classical\" symbiotic Miras (Whitelock 1987).

Symbiotic Miras not classified as PNe\nBI Cru, RR Tel, and RX Pup are typical symbiotic Miras,\nthey have been observed in addition to our PNe sample.\nBI Cru and RX Pup have resolved nebulae (Corradi et al.\n1999a), but unlike the objects mentioned above, they have\nnot been classified as PNe. BI Cru is, due to the pulsation\nof the Mira, slightly brighter than in the measurements of\nMunari et al.

He 2-104 has\nextremely bipolar lobes with high velocity outflows (Lutz\net al. 1989; Corradi & Schwarz 1993; Corradi et al. 2000).\nHe 2-147 is a symbiotic nova containing a Mira, the nebula\naround this object is a ring expanding with a velocity of\n\u223c 100 km s\u22121 (Corradi et al. 1999b, 2000). He 2-104 and\nH 1-36 are also the most extreme targets in Whitelock\n(1987), where thus a circumstellar extinction of AV \u224810.m 0\nis proposed. H 1-36 has larger uncertainties than the other\nobjects (especially in the I band) since it required a complex background subtraction due to the bright nearby star\nHD 161892.\n\nMz 3 (PN G331.7-01.0) shows morphological similarities\nwith He 2-104 and M 2-9. It also has bipolar lobes with\nhypersonic outflows up to 500 km s\u22121 (Redman et al.\n2000). It is suspected to have a symbiotic binary nucleus\n(Balick, private comm.).\nThe \"Butterfly\" nebula M 2-9 (PN G010.8+18.0) has two\nnarrow bright lobes and has changed its shape drastically\nsince its discovery in 1947 (Doyle et al. 2000). Balick\n(1989) identified its central source as a possible symbiotic\nstar. In a recent model (Livio & Soker 2001) the nucleus\nof M 2-9 is supposed to be a system of an AGB or\npost-AGB star and a hot white dwarf.\nH 2-43 (PN G003.4-04.8) is classified as a suspected\nsymbiotic star by Belczy\u0144ski et al. (2000). Our results\nshow clearly that these three nebulae belong to the group\nof symbiotic Miras.\n\n\f4\n\nS. Schmeja and S. Kimeswenger: PN or symbiotic Mira?\n\nHe 2-25 (PN G275.2-03.7), Th 2-B (PK 307-01.1), and\n19W32 (PN G359.2+01.2) are suspected to be symbiotics\n(Corradi 1995), which is supported by our results. Corradi\n(1995) notes strong similarities in the spectra of He 2-25,\nTh 2-B, and M 2-9. In our diagram they also seem to\nform a group, as they are lying relatively close to each\nother. 19W32, however, is placed among the Miras and\nred semiregular variables, clearly separated from the\nnormal PNe as well as from the symbiotic Miras. The\nextinction towards this object is rather uncertain and\nmight move it slightly in the two-colour diagram. In any\ncase, 19W32 is not a genuine PN and may quite possibly\nbelong to the class of symbiotic nebulae.\n\n3.4. Other Bipolar Nebulae\nFrom our sample bipolar nebulae that do not show\nany symbiotic behaviour according to the two-colour\ndiagram are NGC 6537 (PN G010.1+00.7), Sa 2-237\n(PN G011.1+07.0), M 1-57 (PN G022.1-02.4), NGC 2440\n(PN G234.8+02.4), He 2-36 (PN G279.6-03.1), and\nMyCn 18 (PN G307.5-04.9). They are indicated as filled\ncircles in Fig. 3. Thus the sometimes supposed conclusion\nthat all bipolar PNe can be attributed to symbiotic stars\nis certainly wrong.\nA special case is SaSt 1-1 (PN G249.0+06.9). It is a nebula around a symbiotic star (Schwarz 1991; Corradi et al.\n1999a), but in our two-colour diagram it shows colours\nlike a genuine PN. The cool component of this symbiotic\nsystem, however, is not as in the other cases a Mira, but a\nyellow star of G5 spectral type (M\u00fcrset & Schmid 1999).\nThis may be the reason for the \"normal\" colours; it is consistent with the conclusions of Corradi et al. (1999a) that\nthe nebulae around yellow symbiotics might well be the\nPNe of the presently hot white dwarfs of these systems.\n\n4. Conclusion\nWe show that nebulae around symbiotic Miras have NIR\ncolours completely different from genuine PNe. They are\ncharacterized in the two-colour diagram like \"normal\"\nsymbiotic Miras, but well separated from classical Miras.\nComparison of our measurements to those from the literature show that the magnitudes can differ significantly due\nto the Mira variability, whereas the colour indices are more\nor less the same. Thus the colour is a unique idenitifier\nif obtained through simultaneous or quasi simultaneous\nmeasurements. In contrast to classical Miras (Whitelock\net al. 2000) there is no correlation of the NIR colours with\nthe pulsation period.\nWe consider the NIR colours to be a unique tool to distinguish between symbiotic Miras and PNe. In particular\nit turns out that M 2-9 and Mz 3, so far widely regarded\nas classical PNe, in fact belong to the symbiotic Miras.\nNevertheless, further investigations of these objects, especially to detect the cool companions and to study the\nvariations in the radial velocity, are needed. The models to\n\ndescribe the 1-5 \u03bcm SED proposed so far do not work anymore for those objects considering the I band. Thus they\nare either a special class of symbiotic Miras, or the most\nextreme targets within a larger class. Ideas about longterm variations as discussed for RR Tel and IRAS 135686232 by Leeber et al. (1996) have to be followed in detail,\ntoo.\nAcknowledgements.
