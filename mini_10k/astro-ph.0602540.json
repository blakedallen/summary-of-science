The\nsimplest explanation for this would be that a cosmological constant is indeed responsible, but unfortunately the\ncorresponding value of the energy density is in violent disagreement with particle physics expectations, and therefore a considerable effort has been put into finding alternatives.\nA remarkable possibility is provided by topological defects [1]. If our current understanding of particle physics\nand unification scenarios is correct, defect networks must\nnecessarily have formed at phase transitions in the early\nuniverse [2]. Whether or not they are a viable candidate\nto explain the observed acceleration will depend on their\ndetailed dynamics.\nIt has been shown [3] that a key ingredient is what\nis commonly called frustration: in order to accelerate\nthe universe, which necessarily requires a negative pressure (more specifically w = p/\u03c1 < \u22121/3) the networks\nmust be frozen in comoving coordinates. In other words,\nthey must simply be conformally stretched by expansion,\nand have arbitrarily small velocities. In this limit cosmic strings would have w = \u22121/3 (which would nearly\nqualify), though it would be hard to reconcile with observations. In any case, we will show in Sect. II that no\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u00b6 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nppavelin@fc.up.pt\nC.J.A.P.Martins@damtp.cam.ac.uk\njmenezes@fc.up.pt\nrms@fisica.ufpb.br\njeolivei@fc.up.pt\n\nstring network will ever reach this limit. On the other\nhand, domain walls in the same limit are expected to\nhave w = \u22122/3, which makes them a much more promising candidate.\nIt goes without saying that domain walls are cosmologically quite dangerous, and therefore there are very\nstringent bounds on them. These have originally been\ndiscussed by Zel'dovich et al. [4] and later extended in\nvarious ways [5, 6, 7]. However, it must be pointed out\nthat these bounds have not been derived from detailed\nstudies of domain wall dynamics, but rather are based on\nsimple estimates of what this dynamics should be. The\nmost glaring example is that it is often implicitly or explicitly assumed that there is about one domain wall per\nHubble volume, which as we shall see when discussing\nthe wall dynamics in Sects. III and IV need not be the\ncase-in fact it can't be the case for a frustrated network.\nThere are also more detailed but purely phenomenological analyses of this type of models [8, 9, 10]. (The second\nof these in fact claims that under certain fine-tuned conditions on cosmological parameters frustration may not\nbe needed.) At a qualitative level these provide useful\nindications of allowed ranges for cosmological and model\nparameters, but again the analyses are somewhat misled by incorrect assumptions (made by others) on the\ndynamical properties of the networks.\nBy the same token, there is also no through study of\nthe conditions under which domain wall networks may\nbecome frustrated. Some relatively low resolution 2D\nnumerical simulations exist [11, 12], with mixed results.\nOn one hand [11] finds that even in non-trivial models\n(ZN models with moderate values of N ) annihilation processes can be fairly efficient, so that the networks show\nno tendency towards frustration. On the other hand,\nfor fairly large N and suitable choices of initial conditions [12] finds some hints of the possible formation of a\nhexagonal-type lattice, though given the small dynami-\n\n\f2\ncal range of the simulations the results should be considered inconclusive. The fact that the wall velocities are\nhigh (assuming they are being correctly measured [13])\nalso raises some doubts about the interpretation of these\nresults. In another context, a study dealing only with\ncompact dimensions [14] also finds no frustration.\nLast but not least, there have been recent attempts to\nconstruct (by hand) plausible domain wall lattices, and\nthen study their stability [15, 16, 17]. Again these can\nprovide interesting and suggestive results, but of course\nthey fail to address the key issue of if and how such lattices may emerge from realistic initial conditions for domain wall forming phase transitions.\nThe current report is the first in a series that aims to\nput the study of domain wall frustration (or lack thereof)\non a firmer basis. We shall start by making use of a recently developed analytic model for domain wall evolution [13] (the basics of which are explained in Sect. III) to\nderive, in Sect. IV, very general necessary conditions for\nfrustration. The apparently innocuous requirements of\ndomination around the present epoch and small velocities\nare enough to show that any candidate networks must\nbe quite un-naturally fine-tuned (in a precisely quantifiable way). After this 'top-down' result we'll proceed in\nSect. V to discuss an equally important 'bottom-up' one,\nnamely some requirements that any stable lattices must\nobey. A related analysis is made in [18], where energetic\narguments are discussed for a specific model. The discussion will concentrate on the 2D case (which is physically\nmuch simpler than 3D) but some results are expected to\nbe generic. Finally, in Sect. VI we present a summary\nof our results. We will also provide a few very simple\nnumerical illustrations in Sect. V, though we leave an\nextensive numerical study for a companion paper.\n\nII.\n\nCOSMIC STRINGS-A NON-STARTER\n\nBefore we focus on domain wall networks, it is worth\nstarting with a brief note of the case of cosmic strings,\nwhich are sometimes claimed to be able to accelerate the\nuniverse if they are the dominant energy density component. Recall that the equation of state of a cosmic\nstring network depends on its root-mean squared (RMS)\nvelocity as [19]\nws =\n\n1\n(2v 2 \u2212 1) ,\n3 s\n\n(1)\n\nso in the limit vs = 0 its correlation length would behave\nas\nL \u221d a \u221d t.\n\n(2)\n\nNotice that there is a crucial point here which is often\noverlooked: because one knows that there is a sizable\nmatter component \u03a9m0 \u223c 0.3 whose equation of state\nis wm = 0, then in order to accelerate the universe one\nwould need the dark energy component to have wd <\n\u223c\n\n\u22120.5. Be that as it may, it has been shown [20] that when\na string network dominates the universe, the behaviour\nof its correlation length and RMS velocity is\n2\n\nL = \u03b6t \u221d a1+v ,\n\u03b62 =\n\n8\u03c0G\u03bc\n(1 + v 2 )2 ,\n3\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the string mass per unit length, and\nv = const ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhile the scale factor evolves as\n2\n\na \u221d t1/1+v .\n\n(6)\n\nAs expected, the naive solution (2) is recovered for v = 0.\nNote that the string correlation length grows as fast as\nallowed by causality (this is always the attractor for the\nevolution of a string network), but the network is not\nconformally stretched (which would be the case only if\nv = 0). Since the string velocity does not vanish, the\ncorrelation length grows faster than the scale factor. On\nthe other hand the effect of the non-zero velocities is to\nmake a string-dominated universe expand more slowly\nthan one might naively expect, since some of the energy\nof the string network is lost to velocity redshift.\nNumerically it is found [20] that\nvs2 \u223c 0.17\n\n(7)\n\nfor non-intercommuting strings. The velocity is expected\nto be smaller, but still non-zero, for the case of entangled\nstring networks (unlike in the former case, it is not easy\nto numerically determine this value). Ancillary evidence\nfor these results has also been recently discussed in [21].\nHence in a string-dominated universe the string velocity\nnever becomes arbitrarily small, and a string-dominated\nuniverse will not in any circumstances frustrate or accelerate the universe.\nPhysically, this result is to be expected: string evolution is a non-equilibrium, irreversible process (cf. string\nevolution in a contracting universe [22, 23]), and their\ndynamics naturally leads them towards relativistic velocities. In other words, non-trivial mechanisms must\nbe active if they are to remain non-relativistic, let alone\nfreeze completely. Note that friction due to particle scattering, which is the simplest such mechanism, can only\nhave a limited effect. To some extent these points will\nalso relevant for the case of domain wall networks.\nIII.\n\nDOMAIN WALL EVOLUTION\n\nDomain walls arise in models with spontaneously broken discrete symmetries [1, 2]. The simplest example is\nthat of a scalar field \u03c6 with the Lagrangian\nL=\n\n1\n\u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6,\u03b1 \u2212 V (\u03c6) ,\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\nwhere the potential V (\u03c6) has a discrete set of degenerate\nminima, say for example\n\u00132\n\u0012 2\n\u03c6\n.\n(9)\n\u2212\n1\nV (\u03c6) = V0\n\u03c620\n\nis the RMS velocity of the walls, which in turn evolves\naccording to\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndv\nkw\n2\n= (1 \u2212 v )\n\u2212 3Hv ,\n(16)\ndt\nL\n\nBy varying the action\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\nS = dt d3 x \u2212gL\n\nwith kw being another phenomenological parameter related to the typical curvature of the walls-see [26] for a\nthorough discussion of the analogous parameter for cosmic strings. These therefore provide a phenomenological\nmodel for domain wall evolution with two free parameters, that one can measure from high-resolution numerical simulations [13, 27, 28, 29].\nIt is easy to see that, just as for cosmic string networks,\nthe attractor solution to these evolution equations corresponds to a linear scaling solution\n\n(10)\n\nwith respect to \u03c6 we obtain the field equation of motion\n\u22022\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202V\n+ 3H\n\u2212 \u22072 \u03c6 = \u2212\n,\n\u2202t2\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u2207 is the Laplacian in physical coordinates and\nH = (da/dt)/a is the Hubble parameter.\nIn many cosmological contexts of interest, one can\nneglect the domain wall thickness when compared to\nits other dimensions, and thus treat the wall as an infinitely thin surface. With this assumption, its spacetime history can be represented by a 3D world-sheet\nx\u03bc = x\u03bc (\u03b6 a ), a = 0, 1, 2. A new action can then be easily\nderived [1]. In the vicinity of the world-sheet a convenient coordinate choice is the normal distance from the\nsurface. Noticing that in the thin wall limit all fields in\nthe Lagrangian should depend only on this normal coordinate, and integrating out this dependence, one finds\nZ\n\u221a\n(12)\nS = \u2212\u03c3 d3 \u03b6 \u03b3 ,\nwhere\n\u03b3ab = g\u03bc\u03bd x\u03bc,a x\u03bd,b\n\n(13)\n\nis the world-sheet metric, with the obvious definition \u03b3 =\ndet(\u03b3ab ), and \u03c3 is the mass per unit area of the wall.\nNotice that this action is proportional to the 3-volume of\nthe wall's world-sheet, and hence is clearly the analogue\nof the Goto-Nambu action for strings.\nIn analogy with the velocity-dependent one-scale\nmodel for cosmic strings [24, 25, 26], one can obtain a\none-scale model for domain wall evolution. This was derived and tested against numerical simulations in [13] so\nhere we simple state the results we shall be using. Let us\ndefine a characteristic length scale,\nL=\n\n\u03c3\n,\n\u03c1\n\n(14)\n\nwhich is directly related to the average distance between\nadjacent walls measured in the frame comoving with the\nexpansion of the universe. One can then show that its\nevolution equation is as follows\ndL\n= (1 + 3v 2 )HL + cw v ,\ndt\n\n(15)\n\nwhere cw is a phenomenological parameter measuring the\nefficiency of energy losses from the wall network. Here v\n\nL = \u01ebt ,\n\nv = const .\n\n(17)\n\nAssuming that the scale factor behaves as a \u221d t\u03b1 the\ndetailed form of the above linear scaling constants is\nkw (kw + cw )\n3\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\n(18)\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b1 kw\n.\n3\u03b1 kw + cw\n\n(19)\n\n\u01eb2 =\n\nv2 =\n\nAs in the case of cosmic strings [20], an energy loss mechanism (that is, a non-zero cw ) may not be needed in order\nto have linear scaling. Note that this means that having\nnon-intercommuting domain walls is by no means sufficient to ensure a frustrated wall network! Note, however,\nthat the linear scaling solutions are physically very different for cosmic strings and domain walls. In the case\nof cosmic strings, in the linear scaling phase the string\ndensity is a constant fraction of the background density,\nwhereas in the case of domain walls we have\n\u03c1w\n\u221d t,\n\u03c1b\n\n(20)\n\nso the wall density grows relative to the background density, and will eventually become dominant.\nThere is in general, however, an effect which we have\nneglected thus far. At early times, in addition to the\ndamping caused by the Hubble expansion, there is a further damping term coming from friction due to particle\nscattering off the domain walls. Phenomenologically, it\ncan be shown [1] that its effect can be adequately described by a frictional force per unit area\nf =\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\u03b3v .\nlf\n\n(21)\n\nIn the above we have defined a friction length scale which\nwe write as\nlf =\n\n\u03c3\n,\n\u03b2T 4\n\n(22)\n\n\f4\nwhere T is the photon temperature and \u03b2 is a parameter counting the number of species interacting with the\ndomain walls. Note that it is clear that they can't interact strongly with the photons, baryons and dark matter,\notherwise they would be ruled out due to the strong cosmological signatures left over on the cosmic microwave\nbackground and/or large scale structure [4, 5, 6].\nJust like in the case of cosmic strings [24, 25, 26]\none can modify the evolution equations of our one-scale\nmodel to account for this extra friction term. They become\ndL\nL\n(23)\n= HL + v 2 + cw v\ndt\nld\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndv\nv\nkw\n2\n,\n(24)\n= (1 \u2212 v )\n\u2212\ndt\nL\nld\n\nIV.\n\nWALL NETWORK PROPERTIES\n\nIf a domain wall network is to provide the dark energy\nsuggested by observations, there are some obvious and\nunavoidable requirements. Firstly, such a network must\nbe dominating the energy density of the universe around\nthe present day, so its energy density must be of the order\nof the critical density,\n\u03c1w =\n\n(25)\n\nwhich includes both the effects of Hubble damping and\nparticle scattering. It is instructive to compare the importance of both of these terms. At early times particle\nscattering is always dominant (except if it is completely\nabsent, that is if the network is totally non-interacting),\nbut the friction length scale grows faster that the Hubble\nlength and so eventually particle scattering will become\nsub-dominant. The epoch at which the transition occurs\ndepends both on the parameter \u03b2 and on the mass scale\nof the walls, which we can characterise by the scale \u03b7 of\nsymmetry breaking phase transition that produced them,\n\u03c3 \u223c \u03b73 .\n\n(26)\n\nOne can easily find, for \u03b2 \u223c 1, that friction domination\nwill end at the epoch of equal matter and radiation densities for a symmetry breaking scale\n\u0001\n2 1/3\n\u223c 3 GeV\n(27)\n\u03b7eq \u223c mP l Teq\nand will end around the present day for\n\u0012 2 5 \u00131/6\nmP l T 0\n\u03b70 \u223c\n\u223c 1 M eV ,\nTeq\n\n(28)\n\nwhere T0 and Teq are respectively the CMB temperatures\nat the present day and at the epoch of equal matter and\nradiation densities. Note that the dependence on the parameter \u03b2 is weak, and in any case the parameter is quite\ntightly constrained (it can't be much larger than unity).\nThis coincides with the Zel'dovich bound [4], though we\nemphasise that the derivation is different. In particular, the classical derivation implicitly assumes the linear\nscaling solution, which as we saw above is not generically\nthe case: one defect per correlation volume does not necessarily imply one defect per Hubble volume (this point\nhas also been made in [15]). In the following section we\nshall see that tight constraints apply to the parameters\nof any domain wall network if we assume that it becomes\nfrustrated and is starting to accelerate the universe.\n\n(29)\n\nwhich provides us with a unique relation between the\nenergy scale of the defects and the present correlation\nlength, namely\nL0 \u223c\n\nwhere we have defined a damping length scale\n1\n1\n= 3H +\nld\nlf\n\n\u03c3\n1\n\u223c \u03c1c \u223c\n,\nL0\nGt20\n\n\u03b73\nT03 Teq\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\nBut there is a further constraint on the physical correlation length today. The dark energy should be approximately homogeneous and isotropic on cosmological\nscales or otherwise that would result in strong (unobserved) signatures on the cosmic microwave background.\nSo the product\n\u0010\n\u00113\n\u03b7\nL 0 H0 \u223c\n(31)\n30M eV\nmust be much smaller than unity. If we say we need\n\u22121\nL0 <\n\u223c 1 Mpc << H ,\n\n(32)\n\n\u03b7 < 1M eV .\n\n(33)\n\nthen we find again\n\nNow, recall that the averaged equation of state of a\ndomain wall network is given by [19]\nww =\n\n1\n(3v 2 \u2212 2) ,\n3 w\n\n(34)\n\nwhere now vw is the averaged RMS velocity of the domain wall network. So in order to accelerate the universe\nwith an equation of state in agreement with observations\nthe wall velocities must necessarily be quite small. In\ngeneral, this means that the network should be frictiondominated, which takes us back to the bound (28), which\ncoincided with (33). However, during friction domination, one also has [13]\nLv \u223c klf \u223c k\n\n\u03c3\n,\nT4\n\n(35)\n\nfrom which we get at the present day, using the relation\n(30),\nv\u223ck\n\nTeq\n,\nT0\n\n(36)\n\nand since the velocity must be much less than unity,\nk << 10\u22124 .\n\n(37)\n\n\f5\nThe only way to avoid this bound is to enforce that\none has a model where there is no friction due to particle\nscattering (effectively lf = \u221e). In such a case (30,32)\nstill apply, but instead of being friction-dominated all the\nway through to the present day the network would be in\nthe linear scaling regime. In that case, (35) is replaced\nby\nLv \u223c kt \u223c\n\nk\n,\nH0\n\n(38)\n\nand again substituting L0 and requiring that the velocity\nis much smaller than unity we have\nk < L0 H0 << 10\u22124 .\n\n(39)\n\nHence we see that the curvature of the domain walls must\nunavoidably be very small. Note that for the case of ordinary cosmic strings [25, 26] k is a parameter depending\non the string velocity, whose value increases and closely\napproaches unity in the limit of small velocities, and it is\nexpected that the same happens for the simplest domain\nwall models. So the only possibly realistic candidates\nare non-standard networks, that is those with junctions\nwhere N > 2 walls intersect.\nIt is also important to emphasise that for any realistic\nnetwork that is becoming the dominant energy component of the universe around the present day, assuming\na constant equation of state is generically not a good\napproximation. Because the network's equation of state\ndepends on the network velocity (see eqn. 34), it will only\nbe constant if the network is in a linear scaling regime (in\nwhich case w > \u22122/3) or in the asymptotic limit v = 0.\nIn all other cases w should be time-varying. Assuming\nw = const may therefore be a poor approximation. This\nis one of the reasons why currently existing phenomenological analyses of this class of models [8, 9, 10] are only\nat best qualitatively accurate, and a more realistic study\nis called for.\nWe note that the velocity dependent one scale model\nfor domain walls does not fully take into account the features of more complex models, since in that case there\nmight be added contributions (in particular those related\nwith the dynamics of the junctions). However, one can\nargue that the dynamics of these junctions will be reflected in the evolution of curvature parameter which in\nour model is simply a phenomenological parameter characterising domain wall curvature. Hence, we do expect\nthat our simple one scale model model to also be valid (at\nleast qualitatively) in the context of these more complex\nconfigurations. Be that as it may, in the next section we\nshall discuss some properties of such wall network lattices.\nFinally, we note that one of the assumptions in the\nmodel is that the domain wall mass per unit area, \u03c3, is\nfixed. It is certainly possible to envisage more complex\nmodels with different types of walls with various masses\nper unit area. However, we do not expect our conclusions\nto be modified even in these more complex scenarios.\n\nV.\n\nWALL LATTICE PROPERTIES\n\nIn the previous section we have shown that, in order to\nbe able to provide the dark energy, the curvature of the\ndomain walls would have to become very small by the\npresent time. In this section we shall look at geometrical\nproperties of polyhedrons in order to investigate if equilibrium flat domain wall configurations can be the natural\nresult of domain wall network evolution in 2-dimensions.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 formula relating the number of polyhedron vertexes (V ), faces (F ), and edges (E) of genus g\nsurfaces has the form\nV \u2212 E + F = 2 \u2212 2g .\n\n(40)\n\nWe shall assume periodic boundary conditions on a two\ndimensional square box and consequently one is effectively considering a surface of genus equal to unity. Hence\neqn. (40) becomes\nV \u2212E+F =0 .\n\n(41)\n\nWe note that our assumption of periodic boundary condition does not affect our conclusions as long as the size\nof the box is big enough.\nLet us start by considering the case in which the number of edges of each polygon, x, and the number of edges,\nd, meeting at a vertex are fixed. Let us denote the number of polyhedron faces by F = Nx . The number of\npolyhedron vertices is V = Nx x/d since each polygon has\nNx vertexes but each one of them is shared with d \u2212 1\nother polygons. Also the number of polyhedron edges is\nequal to E = Nx x/2 since each polygon has Nx edges\nbut each one of them is shared with another polygon.\nConsequently, in this case eqn. (41) becomes\n\u0010\nx x\u0011\nNx 1 + \u2212\n=0.\n(42)\nd\n2\nThis equation has the following solutions (x = 6, d = 3),\n(x = 4, d = 4), (x = 3, d = 6). These are the well\nknown hexagonal type lattices with odd Y-type junctions, square lattices with even X-type junctions and triangular lattices with even '\u2217'-type junctions in 2 dimensions.\nHowever, in general we do not expect that all the polygons have the same number of edges. Causality constraints mean that such configurations could not arise\ndirectly out of a cosmological phase transition, though\nthey could conceivably be generated dynamically (more\non this below). Hence, let us consider the more interesting situation in which d is fixed but x is not. In this case,\nit is straightforward to show that\nP\u221e\nxNx\n2d\nhxi \u2261 Px=1\n=\n.\n(43)\n\u221e\nd\n\u22122\nN\nx\nx=1\nIt is also easy to show that hxi = 6 if d = 3, hxi = 4\nif d = 4, hxi = 3 if d = 6 and hxi \u2192 2 if d \u2192 \u221e. We\nwill show, in the following discussion, that these simple\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 1: An illustration of the decay of an unstable X-type\njunction into stable Y-type junctions. The decay is energetically favourable since it leads to a reduction of the total length\nof the walls (if all have the same tension).\n\ngeometrical considerations will be relevant for evaluating\nthe potential of domain walls as a dark energy candidate.\nThere are no polygons with two edges. However, the\ndomains in a realistic domain wall network will not in\ngeneral have straight edges and consequently two edge\ndomains are possible. However, these domains will be\nunstable and collapse due to the domain wall curvature\nindependently of the number of elements meeting at each\njunction.\nHere, we are implicitly assuming that the energy associated with the junctions is negligible which in practise\nmeans that they are free to move. This is a reasonable\nassumption, at least for the purposes of the present discussion. If it were not the case, one would have to take\ninto account the contribution of the junctions when calculating the equation of state associated with the domain\nwall network, and consequently w = p/\u03c1 would necessarily be greater than \u22122/3 even for a fully static configuration. Such networks would hardly be compatible with\nobservational bounds.\nIt is also straightforward to show from a local stability\nanalysis that three, four and five edge domains will also\nbe unstable if only Y-type junctions (d = 3) occur in\na given model. This is a particularly interesting case\nsince one can show using local energy considerations that\nin models with more than two vacua, if all the domain\nwalls connecting the various vacua have equal energies\nthen only Y-type stable junctions would form (see Fig.\n1). Higher-order junctions are unstable and very quickly\ndecay into Y junctions. A good illustration of this point\nis the 'pentahedral' model discussed in [15]. The author\nerroneously claims that this a candidate for frustration\nwith X-type junctions, when in fact it will form Y-type\njunctions. This can easily be checked numerically, and\nso can the fact that even if one constructs (by hand) a\nbox with X-type junctions these will quickly decay into\nY-type junctions.\n\nFIG. 2: An illustration of the collapse of three (top) and four\n(down) edge domains with Y-type junctions. The collapse is\nenergetically favourable since it leads to a reduction of the\ntotal length of the walls.\n\nFIG. 3: An illustration two different six-edged polygons with\nY-type junctions of walls with same tension. Both configurations have the same energy.\n\nFig. 2 shows various polygons formed by walls with\nequal tension. Note that in both cases, x = 3 (top) and\nx = 4 (bottom), the total length of walls decreases. Consequently, the polygons will tend to collapse thus minimising their potential energy. On the other hand in Fig.\n3, for x = 6, the length remains constant and both configurations have the same energy. Hence, given that d = 3\nimplies hxi = 6, the only possible equilibrium configuration with only Y -type junctions is a hexagonal type\nlattice (otherwise unstable two, three, four and five edge\ndomains would occur).\nAlthough hexagonal lattices with Y -type junctions al-\n\nFIG. 4: An illustration of the collapse of a four-edged polygon\nin the case where two of the surrounding domains are on the\nsame vacuum state. The collapse leads to a reduction of the\nnumber of edges of contiguous domains.\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 5: An illustration of the collapse of a four-edged polygon\nin the case where all the surrounding domains are on different\nvacuum states and the domain walls all have the same tension.\nAgain, the collapse leads to a reduction of the number of edges\nof contiguous domains.\n\nlow for locally confined energy conserving deformations,\nHubble damping may prevent the collapse of such configurations (even if they are perturbed) and consequently\none should not completely discard them on this basis.\nHowever, we do not expect that hexagonal lattices will\nbe an attractor for the evolution of domain wall network\nsimulations. Although a four edge domain is unstable\nin this context, its collapse will modify the properties of\nits four contiguous domains with EI , EII , EIII and EIV\nedges. If we assume that the first two will join, as happens in the example given in Fig.4, the resulting domain\nwill have EI + EII \u2212 4 edges while the other two will have\nEIII \u2212 2 and EIV \u2212 2 edges after the collapse of the four\nedge domain. The production of three hexagons as a result of the collapse of a four edge domain is improbable\nsince it would require EI +EII = 10 and EIII = EIV = 8.\nOf course, in a model with a very large number of vacua\nthe probability that two nearby triple wall junctions will\nannihilate can be made arbitrarily small. In fact as the\nnumber of vacua increases, the probability that the configuration shown in Fig. 5 occurs becomes much greater\nthan the one given in Fig. 4. Still, the collapse of unstable domains with two, three, four and five edges will\nalways result in a decrease in the number of edges of some\nof the contiguous domains. Again, we do not expect that\na domain wall network in two dimensions will naturally\nevolve towards a hexagonal lattice from realistic initial\nconditions.\nAlso, no equilibrium configurations exists with d > 6.\nThis means that if we started with a domain wall network with d > 6 unstable two edge domains would necessarily be present and consequently the number elements\nmeeting at a junction will often have to be reduced to a\nnumber smaller than 6. Hence, we anticipate that odd Y type and/or even X-type junctions will be generic even\nin models where the number of elements meeting at a\njunction is allowed to be greater than four.\nWe have seen that in a model where all the domain\nwalls connecting the various vacua have the same tension,\nit is not expected that a frustrated domain wall network\nwill naturally occur. However if we relax this assumption we are adding a different source of instability since\nthe walls with higher tension will tend to collapse thus\nincreasing the dimensionality of the junctions which, in\n\nFIG. 6: An illustration of the collapse of two Y-type junctions\ninto one X-type junction. The thickness of the traces indicates\nthe tension strength. If the thick wall has a tension larger\nthan twice that of the lower tension ones the collapse must\nhappen.\n\nFIG. 7: The evolution of a perturbed square lattice with even\nX-type junctions in a matter-dominated universe. The top left\npanel is the initial configuration. From left to right and top to\nbottom panels the horizon is approximately 1/256, 1/20, 1/10\nand 1/5 of the box size respectively. The lattice stabilises in\nthe right bottom panel configuration.\n\nturn, will lead to the production of further unstable two\nedge domains. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 6 which\nshows the collapse of two Y-type junctions into one Xtype junction which must necessarily occur if the thick\nwall has a tension larger than twice that of the lower\ntension ones.\nHence, although we have not presented a rigorous\nformal proof, we conjecture that it is unlikely that 2dimensional domain wall network evolution from realistic\ndomain wall forming phase transitions will ever produce\na frustrated network. Our analysis can only be fully applied to domain walls networks in 2-dimensions. However, some of our results can also be generalised to 3dimensions, at a cost of a much greater complexity. It is\nnot clear that the increase in the number of degrees of\nfreedom which occurs when we go from 2 to 3-dimensions\nwill help frustration and consequently we believe that our\nsimpler analysis in 2-dimensions is a crucial step in accessing domain walls networks as dark energy candidates.\nFinally, we illustrate our results with two simple nu-\n\n\f8\nhave a chance of accounting for the dark energy. We have\nmade use of simple analytic tools to derive a strong bound\non the wall curvature, which implies that any candidate\nnetwork must be considerably fine-tuned. We have also\nconsidered various simple lattice properties in two spatial\ndimensions, and used energy considerations to obtain a\nnumber of requirements that any stable lattice of frustrated walls must obey. Although the extrapolation of\nsome of the results of the latter analysis to the case of\nthree spatial dimensions is non-trivial, it is clear that\nsome general trends will remain.\n\nFIG. 8: The evolution of a perturbed hexagonal lattice with\nodd Y-type junctions in the matter-dominated epoch. The\ntop left panel is the initial configuration. From left to right\nand top to bottom panels the horizon is approximately 1/256,\n1/10, 1/5 and 2/5 of the box size respectively. The lattice\nstabilises in the right bottom panel configuration.\n\nmerical examples. The stability of simple examples of\ntriangular, hexagonal and square domain wall lattices in\n2D was studied by analytic means in [15, 16, 17], specifically by looking at their macroscopic elastic properties.\nThe authors assess the stability of various lattice configurations and find that some of them are stable. Here, we\nconfirm using numerical simulations that there are certain lattice configurations which are indeed stable even\nagainst large deformations. In Fig.7 we show a field theory numerical simulation in the matter dominated epoch\nfor a perturbed square lattice with even X-type junctions. As expected the network evolves towards the minimum energy equilibrium configuration. The evolution\nof a perturbed hexagonal lattice with odd Y-type junctions in the matter dominated epoch is shown in Fig.8.\nAs it was mentioned before this is the only possible equilibrium configuration if only Y-type junctions are permitted. Although in [15, 16, 17] the authors claim that\nan hexagonal lattice with Y-type junctions is unstable,\nthe expansion of the Universe will damp the domain wall\nvelocities which may drive the network towards an equilibrium configuration (as shown in Fig.8). We have performed a similar simulation in Minkowski space and in\nthat case the configuration is always unstable. This is\nto be expected since no damping mechanism operates in\nthis case. These results clearly indicate that the crucial question is not the existence of specific stable lattice\nconfigurations but whether any of these can be the natural result of domain wall network evolution from realistic\ninitial conditions. A more detailed numerical analysis of\nthese issues will be left for a forthcoming publication.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nWe have studied necessary conditions for a network of\ncosmic domain walls to become frustrated, and thereby\n\nSeveral key points emerge from our analysis, each of\nwhich will be considered in detail in forthcoming work.\nFirstly, there is some model dependence involved, which\nis to be expected given the whole zoo of existing models. Some of these have been studied in the past, but\nothers remain explored. Secondly, energy considerations\nare the main driving mechanism for the evolution of wall\nnetworks with junctions, though topological arguments\nalso play a role. An example of the power of these mechanisms is the simple yet crucial result that in models\nwith more than two vacua, if all the domain walls connecting the various vacua have equal energies then only\nY-type stable junctions would form. As we have pointed\nout above, this point has been overlooked in some of the\nexisting literature.\nLast but not least, the difference between designer conditions (that is, lattice configurations built by hand) and\nconditions that might possibly arise as the outcome of\ndomain wall forming phase transitions cannot be overemphasised. In this regard, even the presence or absence of\nexpansion can have non-trivial effects. Our results lead\nus to conjecture that, even though one can build (by\nhand) lattices that would be stable, no such lattices will\never come out of realistic domain wall forming cosmological phase transitions. If so, then defect networks are\nruled out as an explanation for the dark energy. We shall\nexplore this conjecture, in particular through detailed numerical analysis, in a companion paper.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Eduardo Lage and Jo\u00e3o Lopes dos\nSantos for useful discussions.\nThis work was done in the context of the ESF\nCOSLAB network and funded by FCT (Portugal),\nin the framework of the POCI2010 program, supported by FEDER.
