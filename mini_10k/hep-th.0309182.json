INTRODUCTION\nField theories defined on a NC geometry are\nhighly fashionable, in particular because they\narise from a low energy limit of string theory [1].\nA NC space may be defined by the non\u2013\ncommutativity of some of its coordinates\n2d\n\n[x\u0302\u03bc , x\u0302\u03bd ] = i\u0398\u03bc\u03bd = i\u03b8\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(1)\n\nFor a review of NC field theories, see Ref. [2].\n2. THE NC \u03bb\u03c64 MODEL\nThe extension of actions of commutative field\ntheories to their NC counterparts can be realized\nby replacing all products between fields by the\nstar\u2013product\n1\n\nf (x) \u22c6 g(x) = e 2\n\ni\u0398\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202y\u03bd\n\nf (x)g(y)|x=y . (2)\n\nIn the NC \u03bb\u03c64 model this replacement leads to\nthe action\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nm2 2 \u03bb\n1\n\u03c6 + \u03c6\u22c6\u03c6\u22c6\u03c6\u22c6\u03c6 ,\nS = dd x \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6+\n2\n2\n4\nwhere only the interaction term requires the star\u2013\nproduct.\nIn perturbation theory the one loop contribution to the 1 PI two point function splits into\ntwo parts coming from the planar and the non\u2013\nplanar graphs. The planar terms are proportional\npresented by F. Hofheinz at Lattice 2003.\nPreprint HU-EP-03/66.\n\nto their (UV divergent) commutative counterparts [3]. In the case of the non\u2013planar graphs the\nmomentum cut\u2013off \u039b is replaced by an effective\ncut\u2013off \u039beff [4],\n\u039b2eff =\n\n1\n\u039b2\n\n1\n,\n+ \u03b8 2 p2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere p denotes the incoming momentum. The\ncut\u2013off \u039b may be safely send to infinity, leading\nto a UV finite contribution. However, the UV divergences reappear as IR divergences in the limit\np \u2192 0. This mixing of UV and IR effects still\ncauses serious problems in a perturbative treatment of NC field theories beyond one loop.\nWe studied the mixing of divergences non\u2013\nperturbatively in the 3d model, with a commutative time direction. 2 To avoid the (CPU) time\nconsuming lattice version of the star\u2013product, we\nmapped the system on a dimensionally reduced\nmodel [7]. Here the scalar fields \u03c6(~x, t) defined on\na N 2 \u00d7 T lattice are mapped on N \u00d7 N Hermitian\nmatrices \u03c6\u0302(t). Their action reads\n\u0014\n\u00112\nPT\nP \u0010\nS[\u03c6\u0302] = N Tr t=1 21 \u03bc \u0393\u03bc \u03c6\u0302(t) \u0393\u2020\u03bc \u2212 \u03c6\u0302(t)\n(4)\n\u0015\n\u0010\n\u00112\n2\n+ 21 \u03c6\u0302(t+1) \u2212 \u03c6\u0302(t) + m2 \u03c6\u03022 (t) + \u03bb4 \u03c6\u03024 (t) ,\nwhere the twist\u2013eaters \u0393\u03bc are defined by\n\u2217\n\u0393\u03bc \u0393\u03bd = Z\u03bc\u03bd\n\u0393\u03bd \u0393\u03bc ,\n\nZ\u03bc\u03bd = e\n\n\u2217 Talk\n\n2 For\n\n+1\n\u03c0i NN\n\n\u2217\n= Z\u03bd\u03bc\n\nwhere\n\n(5)\n\n(\u03bc < \u03bd) is the twist.\n\ncorresponding studies in d = 2, see Refs.

DISPERSION RELATION\nThe star\u2013product breaks explicitly the Lorentz\nsymmetry, which leads to a deformation of the\nstandard dispersion relation.

The ordered regime splits\ninto a uniformly ordered phase and a striped\nphase, where the transition region is marked by\ntwo vertical lines for each value of N .\nTo illustrate the striped phase we present in\nFig. 2 snapshots of single configurations, which\nrepresent the ground state in this phase in the\nx1 \u2013x2 plane at fixed time t for N = 55 at \u03bb = 50\nand m2 = \u221215. The dotted areas indicate \u03c6 > 0\nand in the blank areas \u03c6 is negative. Here we show\nconfigurations with two diagonal stripes resp. four\nstripes parallel to the x1 axis.

(3). The deformation\ncauses a shift in the energy minimum from p~ = ~0\nto non\u2013zero momenta.\nWe investigated numerically the energy\u2013\nmomentum relation in the disordered phase. The\nenergy E(~\np) can be computed from the correlator\nG(m,\n~ \u03c4) =\n\n\u0011E\n1 XD \u0010 \u2217\nRe \u03c6\u0303 (m,\n~ t)\u03c6\u0303(m,\n~ t + \u03c4) ,\n2\nN T t\n\nwhere the physical momenta are given by p~ =\n2\u03c0 m/N\n~\n. This correlator behaves like a cosh\n\u0011\n\u0010\nG(m,\n~ \u03c4 ) \u221d e\u2212E(~p) \u03c4 + e\u2212E(~p)(T \u2212\u03c4 ) , (8)\nand the study of its decay allows to extract the\nenergy. In Fig. 3 (on top) the system is close\nto the uniformly ordered phase transition. Here\nthe square of the energy is linear in p~ 2 as in\na Lorentz invariant theory.

This\nis a remarkable result, since due to the UV/IR\nmixing there could be strong effects from higher\norder calculations. Our results imply that such effects do not change the results qualitatively.

We\nsee a clear deviation from Lorentz symmetry. The\nminimum of the energy is now at the lowest non\u2013\nzero (lattice) momentum and thus there will be\ntwo stripes parallel to the axes in the non\u2013uniform\nphase.\nIn Fig. 4 the results at very large coupling \u03bb, far\noutside the phase diagram in Fig. 1, are shown.\nNow the energy minimum is shifted to larger momenta, leading to the more complicated patterns\nin the striped phase as in Fig. 2.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4 the solid lines are fits to the\none loop result for the energy in Eq.

Close to the uniform phase at\nN 2 \u03bb = 90, N 2 m2 = \u221222.5 (on top) and close to\nthe striped phase at N 2 \u03bb = 450, N 2 m2 = \u2212360\n(below).\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nWe studied numerically the effects of UV/IR\nmixing in the 3d NC \u03bb\u03c64 model. For the phase\ndiagram we found that the ordered regime is split\ninto an Ising type phase for small coupling \u03bb and\na striped phase for larger coupling. The patterns\n\n1. N. Seiberg and E.
