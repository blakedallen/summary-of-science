In zero field, the AFM and SC orders are\ncompetitive with each other and tend not to coexist with each other [1]. Recently, AFM quantum critical phenomena\nnear the SC pair-breaking field Hc2 (0) have been observed commonly in the heavy-fermion superconductors such as\nCeCoIn5 [2\u20134], pressured CeRhIn5 [5], NpPd5 Al2 [6], and Ce2 PdIn8 [7], which indicates field-tuned proximity of an\nAFM instability to the onset of the SC order. However, these materials do not show any magnetic order in the normal\nstate: An AFM fluctuation is merely enhanced with decreasing field toward Hc2 (0) in the nonmagnetic normal state.\nFurther, it has been also clarified in CeCoIn5 that the AFM fluctuation is enhanced as Hc2 (0) is approached by\nincreasing the field in the SC phase. A basic origin of the strong AFM fluctuation induced in the vicinity of Hc2 (0)\nseems to consist in characteristic features of these superconductors, i.e., the strong Pauli-paramagnetic pair-breaking\n(PPB) effect and a d-wave SC pairing symmetry. In our previous paper [8], we have shown that, in a SC phase with\na d-wave pairing symmetry, the PPB effect enhanced by increasing field and decreasing temperature tends to induce\nan AFM order and that the field-induced AFM fluctuation found below Hc2 (0) can be explained as a result of this\nnovel PPB effect. In this paper, we will extend our previous theory to describe spatial variations of the AFM order\nin a SC vortex lattice by bearing the experimental studies on CeCoIn5 in our mind.\nCeCoIn5 is a spin-singlet superconductor with a layered crystal structure along c-axis [9] and its SC pairing symmetry\nis believed to be of dx2 \u2212y2 -type [10]. In the SC state in a magnetic field perpendicular to the basal plane (H k c),\nan anomalous field dependence of the vortex lattice form factor (VLFF), which is a measure of spatial distribution of\nthe internal magnetic field in vortex lattice states, has been observed in neutron scattering experiments. It has been\nknown that, although VLFF decreases with increasing field in the conventional type II superconductors [11, 12], it\nrather increases with increasing field in CeCoIn5 , and that the slope of VLFF in this material becomes sharp abruptly\nin higher fields near Hc2 (0) at low temperatures [13, 14]. First, this intriguing behavior has been explained as a result\nof strong PPB [15]. However, the origin of the abrupt increase in higher fields has not been sufficiently explained\nthere. In the preceding theoretical study on VLFF in Ref. [15], the strong AFM fluctuation induced in the SC state\njust below the Hc2 (T ) curve [3, 4, 18\u201320] is not taken into account. If the AFM order and fluctuation occurring in\nCeCoIn5 just below Hc2 (0) are of a SC origin, it is rather necessary to incorporate effects of the PPB-induced AFM\nfluctuation in explaining VLFF data. In addition, a possible relation between such a field-induced increase of VLFF\nand the proposed FFLO state [16, 17] at the high field end of the SC phase should be considered.\nOn the other hand, in a magnetic field parallel to the basal plane (H k ab), the existence of a high-field and\nlow-temperature (HFLT) SC phase has been clarified previously and has been identified with a spatially modulated\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) [21, 22] vortex lattice state [23, 24]. However, recent neutron scattering\nexperiments have shown that an AFM order with its staggered moment vector oriented along c-axis exists only inside\nthe HFLT phase [25, 26]. On the other hand, the doping experiment [27] indicating that the HFLT phase is quite\nsensitive to both the magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities and is destroyed by quite a small amount of nonmagnetic\nimpurities supports the FFLO picture on this HFLT phase [28]. Further, a recent NMR measurement has clarified\nthe presence in the HFLT phase of normal state regions possibly corresponding to the FFLO nodal planes of the SC\n\n\f2\norder parameter, while the AFM order in the HFLT phase is, at least in the higher field region of the HFLT phase,\napparently homogeneous in real space [29]. Although several microscopic pictures on an AFM order in the d-wave\nsuperconductors in high fields have been proposed so far [30\u201332], these experimental results are comprehensively\nexplained by the scenario that the HFLT phase is a realization of the longitudinal FFLO vortex lattice state [28], and\nthat the AFM order observed inside the HFLT phase is induced by PPB and favors coexistence with the SC order [30].\nIn Ref. [30], the spatial distributions of the PPB-induced AFM order in the presence of the FFLO modulation parallel\nto the applied magnetic field has been theoretically investigated in the Pauli limit where the effect of the in-plane\nvortex-lattice modulation is neglected. Although the result obtained in the Pauli limit seems to give a correct picture\non spatial orderings over larger scales, the vortex lattice modulation must be inevitably included to describe local\nproperties such as the internal magnetic field and the spatial distribution of the AFM order. In this paper, we will\ninvestigate the spatial distributions of the internal magnetic field brought by the AFM fluctuation and a possible AFM\norder in the presence of the vortex lattice, taking account of both the orbital and Pauli-paramagnetic pair-breaking\neffects in the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) approach where the perturbative expansion with respect to the SC and AFM\norder parameters is used. It will be shown that VLFF is enhanced by an additional magnetic screening brought by\nthe PPB-induced AFM fluctuation and that the enhancement becomes more remarkable as an AFM instability is\napproached, which suggests that the anomalous field dependence of VLFF observed in CeCoIn5 in H k c is due to the\nPPB-induced AFM critical fluctuation. It will also be discussed that the spatial modulation of the SC vortex lattice\nenhances the AFM fluctuation, and thus that an AFM order with a spatial modulation synchronized with the vortex\nlattice appears. The modulated AFM is not localized in the vortex core but prefers to coexist with a nonvanishing\nSC order, which is the same tendency as that of the AFM order modulated by the longitudinal FFLO structure of\nthe SC order parameter [8, 30].\nThe outline of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we introduce the theoretical model and derive a Ginzburg-Landau\n(GL) free-energy functional and a Maxwell equation for the internal magnetic field. The effect of the PPB-induced\nAFM fluctuation on VLFF in the case with H k c is discussed in Sec. III. This is followed by Sec. IV in which we\nargue the PPB-induced AFM order in the SC vortex lattice state in the case with H k ab. Summary is provided in\nSec. VI.\nII.\nA.\n\nFORMULATION\n\nElectronic Hamiltonian\n\nWe start from the electronic Hamiltonian involving a kinetic energy for noninteracting quasiparticles with the\nZeeman energy H0 and two interaction terms leading to d-wave superconductivity HSC and antiferromagnetism\nHAFM .

The unit h\u0304 = c = kB = 1 is\nused throughout this paper. In the Hamiltonian, \u0109p,\u03b1 is the annihilation operator for a quasiparticle with momentum\np and spin projection \u03b1, \u03b5(p) is a kinetic energy measured from the Fermi level EF , and the Zeeman energy is\n\n\f3\nexpressed as \u03bcB gB(r) with the magnetic flux B(r), a g-factor, and the Bohr magneton \u03bcB . The vector potential A(r)\nis expressed as A(r) = A0 (r) + a(r) and is related to the magnetic flux by the equation\nB(r) = \u2207 \u00d7 A(r) = H \u1e90 + \u2207 \u00d7 a(r),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u2207 \u00d7 A0 (r) = H, and spatially varying internal magnetic fields are given in terms of a(r). The direction of the\nuniform external magnetic field H is denoted by \u1e90 and will be fixed along the z axis (\u1e90 = \u1e91) in H k c case and the y\naxis (\u1e90 = \u0177) in H k ab case. Concerning the interaction terms, |g| and U are coupling constants with positive values,\n\u03c3i (i = x, y, z) are the Pauli matrices, wp denotes a SC pairing symmetry, and Q0 = (\u03c0/a, \u03c0/a, \u03c0/d) with a lattice\nconstant a in the ab plane is the commensurate nesting vector. Since the pairing symmetry wp is assumed to be of\ndx2 \u2212y2 -type, the identity\nwp+Q0 = \u2212wp\n\n(4)\n\nis satisfied. In our model Hamiltonian, antiferromagnetism is induced by the nesting property of the dispersion\n\u03b5(p + Q0 ) = \u2212\u03b5(p) + Tc \u03b4IC ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the deviation from the perfect nesting condition is scaled by the SC transition temperature Tc and is measured\nby the dimensionless parameter \u03b4IC [33]. Although \u03b4IC is p-dependent in general, \u03b4IC is assumed to be a constant\nvalue since the details of the dispersion do not change our result qualitatively [30]. Then, the Fermi velocity vector\nvp defined by d \u03b5(p)/d p satisfies the relation vp+Q0 = \u2212vp .\nIn order to discuss AFM order and fluctuation in the SC state, we introduce the SC pair-field \u2206(q) and the AFM\nstaggered field m(q) which are defined by\n\u2206(q) = |g|h\u03a8\u0302(q)i,\n\nm(q) = U h\u015c(q)i,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere h i represents the statistical average. Here, \u2206(q) (m(q)) plays a role of the SC (AFM) order parameter. In the\nmean-field approximation, the interaction terms in the Hamiltonian are expressed as\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n1 X\n|\u2206(q)|2 \u2212\n\u2206(q) \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (q) + H.c. ,\n|g| q\nq\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n1 X\nm(q) * \u015c\u2020 (q) + H.c. .\n|m(q)|2 \u2212\n=\nU q\nq\n\nHSC =\nHAFM\n\n(7)\n\nAlthough, in principle, the AFM moment vector m(q) can be oriented in any direction, the two typical configurations,\nm k H and m \u22a5 H, will be considered since, in CeCoIn5 of our interest, the configuration m k c \u22a5 H has been\nconfirmed in the AFM order observed inside the HFLT phase in H k ab case and m k H would be realized in H k c\ncase if m is locked in the c-axis.\nB.\n\nGinzburg-Landau free energy functional\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\u0001\nfree energy of this system is given by F = \u2212T ln Trc,c\u2020 ,\u2206,\u2206\u2217 ,m exp \u2212 (H0 + HSC + HAFM )/T +\nR The\nd3 rB2 (r)/(8\u03c0). In this paper, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy of a form expanded in powers\nof both |\u2206(q)| and |m(q)|, taking both the orbital and Pauli-paramagnetic pair-breaking effects into account. Formally, the mean-field GL free-energy density in the present system can be written as\n(2)\n\n(4)\n\n(6)\n\n(2,2)\n\n(2)\n(4)\nFGL (\u2206, m) = F\u2206 + F\u2206 + F\u2206 + Fm\n+ F\u2206,m + Fm\n,\n(l)\n\n(8)\n\n(l)\n\nwhere F\u2206 (Fm ) is the lth order term dependent only on |\u2206| (|m|), and the leading order SC-AFM coupling term\n(2,2)\nF\u2206,m , which is proportional to |\u2206|2 |m|2 , is incorporated. We note that, although the correction to the |m|4 term\n(2,4)\n\nF\u2206,m , which is proportional to |\u2206|2 |m|4 , should be also incorporated in examining the character of the AFM transition,\n(2,4)\n\nF\u2206,m is omitted here since we have already checked that it tends to make the AFM transition a continuous one [30].\nFirst, we determine the Hc2 (T ) curve and the amplitude of the spatially averaged gap function \u22062 \u2261 h|\u2206(r)|2 isp from\n\n\f4\n(2)\n\n(6)\n\n(4)\n\nthe SC part of the GL free energy F\u2206 + F\u2206 + F\u2206 . This procedure in which \u2206 and m are separately considered is\njustified at least near the second order AFM transition.

Since VLFF measures the inhomogeneous\npart of the magnetic flux, the problem results in obtaining the spatially varying internal magnetic field.\nWe derive a Maxwell equation relating the internal magnetic field b(r) \u2261 \u2207 \u00d7 a(r) in Eq. (3) to screening currents\nfrom the saddle point equation of the total free energy with respect to A \u03b4F/\u03b4A = 0, i.e., \u03b4H0 /\u03b4A A=A0 + \u2207 \u00d7\n(\u2207 \u00d7 A(r))/(4\u03c0) = 0.

In the right-hand side of Eq. (32), the first term is the usual term expressing the\ncurrent density, while the second term arises from the Zeeman term [36]. In this paper, we will use the perturbative\nexpansion for the quasiparticle Green's function with respect to both |\u2206| and |m|.

The contribution\n(0)\nG\u03b5n ,\u03c3 has been dropped since it only gives a spatially uniform flux. We note that the SC fourth order term G(4)\nis incorporated since, in the case with strong PPB of our interest, |\u2206| is finite even on the Hc2 (T ) curve at low\ntemperatures due to the first order Hc2 transition and higher order SC contributions are not safely negligible.

As a result, the equality |F\u00b12,0 | =\n|F1,\u00b11 | is not satisfied any longer, while the equality |F\u00b11,1 | = |F1,\u00b11 | is still satisfied. Since the four (m1 , m2 ) points\nwith the same |Fm1 ,m2 | value, \u00b1(1, 1) and \u00b1(1, \u22121), correspond to the spots with the strongest neutron scattering\nintensity in the experiments, we will calculate |F1,1 | which is given by\nZ h\ni\nh\ni\n1\n(2,2)\n(4)\n(2)\nF1,1 =\n(r)\nexp\n\u2212\ni\n(\u03c0/k,\nk)\n*\n(X,\nY\n)\n.\n(49)\n(r)\n+\nb\nb\u2206 (r) + b\u2206 (r) + b(0,2)\nm\n\u2206,m\nV r\n(l)\n\n(l,m)\n\nThe form factor |F1,1 | is easily obtained by using Eqs.

In the results of our calculation below, |F1,1 | is normalized\nby 4\u03c0CGL .\nIn the present theory, the layered crystal structure is reflected in the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity vector vp .\nAlthough the expression of vp should be derived from the realistic dispersion, for brevity we use the following simplified\nform of vp :\n\u0002\n\u0001\u00031/2\n(x\u0302 cos \u03c6 + \u0177 sin \u03c6) + Jd sin(pz d)\u1e91,\nvp = vF 1 \u2212 (J/EF ) 1 \u2212 cos(pz d)\n\n(50)\n\nwhere J is an interlayer coupling constant. The Fermi velocity vector introduced here corresponds to that of the\ncorrugated\ncylindrical Fermi surface. Then, the anisotropy of the SC coherence length \u03b3 can be expressed as \u03b3 =\np\n2 1 \u2212 J/EF /(\u03c0J/EF ) and the angle average on the Fermi surface is defined by\nA\n\nFS\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nd (pz d)\nA.\n2\u03c0\n\n(51)\n\nIn the numerical calculation below, J/EF = 0.2 and pF d = \u03c0 are used, and then, \u03b3 = 2.85 is obtained.\nIn the numerical calculation, the magnetic field H is normalized by the orbital limiting field in the pure two\n(orb)\ndimensional system H2D (0) = 0.28/(|e|\u03be02 ). Then, the two field-dependent energy scales \u03bcB gH and vF /(2\u03c0 rH )\nwhich correspond to the paramagnetic pair-breaking effect and the orbital one, respectively are expressed as follows:\n(orb)\n\n(orb)\n\n(0)\n(0)\nH\n\u03bcB gH\n\u03c0 H\n= h \u03b1M,j \u03b3E 2D\n= 0.882 \u03b1M,j 2D\nh,\n(orb)\n(orb)\nTc\n2e H\n(0)\n(0)\nHj\nj\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nvF\n\u03be0\n(orb)\n(52)\n=\n= \u03be0 2|e|H2D (0) h = 0.748 h,\nrH\n2\u03c0 rH Tc\n\u221a\n(orb)\nwhere the Maki parameter \u03b1M,j = 2 Hj\n(0)/Hp (0) measures the strength of the paramagnetic pair-breaking effect\n\u221a\n(orb)\nand h = H/H2D (0) is the normalized magnetic field.

Throughout this section, \u03b1M,c = 5.8\nis used in obtaining main results. The temperature-field phase diagram obtained by minimizing FGL (\u2206, m = 0) is\nshown in the inset in Fig. 5, where the Hc2 transition at low temperatures is of first order, and a possible FFLO\nvortex lattice state appearing just below the Hc2 (T ) curve as a narrow HFLT region [16, 17] is neglected because it\ndoes not affect the SC properties in the field range of our interest. In fact, we will demonstrate later in Sec. IV C\nthat, even if the FFLO vortex lattice is taken into account, VLFF in H k c case will be hardly affected by a FFLO\nspatial structure. Below, we will show results of our calculation in two cases, m \u22a5 H and m k H, since the direction\nof m relative to the external magnetic field H has not been confirmed in H k c case.\n\n\f13\n1\n\n|F1,1|\n\n2\n\n-3\n\n1\u009810\n\n1\n\n0.006\n\n0.8\n\n-6\n\n1\u009810\n\n0.004\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.002\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n-9\n\n1\u009810\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0\n\nH/Hc2,c(0)\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nH/H c2,c (0)\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Logarithmic plots of VLFF |F1,1 |2 at t = 0.1 as a function of magnetic field scaled by the upper critical\nfield at T = 0 Hc2,c (0) for various values of Maki parameter \u03b1M,c . Here, |F1,1 |2 is normalized by (4\u03c0CGL )2 . Dotted, dashed,\nand solid curves correspond to the cases with \u03b1M,c = 0.01, \u03b1M,c = 3.5, and \u03b1M,c = 5.8, respectively. The form factor |F1,1 |2 is\nenhanced by strong PPB at high fields, and as a result, the slope changes its sign from negative to positive. The inset shows\nthe regular plot of the |F1,1 |2 curves shown in the main panel, where the results for \u03b1M,c = 0.01 (dotted curve) and \u03b1M,c = 5.8\n(solid one) are measured by the left and right vertical axes, respectively.\n\nA.\n\nParamagnetic pair-breaking effect on VLFF\n\nFirst, PPB effects on VLFF in the case without AFM fluctuation will be discussed. Figure 3 shows the field\ndependences of VLFF at t = 0.1 for \u03b1M,c = 0.01 (dotted curve), \u03b1M,c = 3.5 (dashed one), and \u03b1M,c = 5.8 (solid\none). As one can see in Fig. 3, VLFF is enhanced especially at high fields by the PPB effect. For the sufficiently\nlarge \u03b1M,c , VLFF increases with increasing field while it decreases in the case with the small \u03b1M,c . The inset in Fig.\n3 shows the regular plots of VLFF as a function of magnetic field scaled by Hc2,c (0) in the two cases, \u03b1M,c = 0.01\nand \u03b1M,c = 5.8. The difference in the field dependence of VLFF can be clearly seen. To see that VLFF measures\n(2)\n(4)\nspatial distributions of the internal magnetic field, the longitudinal internal magnetic fields b\u2206 (r) + b\u2206 (r) in the\ncases with \u03b1M,c = 0.01 and \u03b1M,c = 3.5 are shown in Fig. 4 (b) and (c), respectively. In the SC vortex lattice state\nshown in Fig. 4 (a), the internal field in the direction along the applied magnetic field is induced at the vortex core\n(4)\n(2)\nas a result of the magnetic screening outside the vortex core. The anisotropic structure of b\u2206 (r) + b\u2206 (r) around\nthe vortex core is due to the mismatch between the four-fold d-wave pairing symmetry and the six-fold triangular\nlattice symmetry. Comparing (b) with (c), one can see that, due to the PPB effect, the magnetic flux is concentrated\ninside the vortex core as a result of the enhanced magnetic screening outside the vortex core. The enhancement of\nVLFF shown in Fig. 3 is understood as a consequence of the concentration of the magnetic flux inside the vortex\ncore, or equivalently, the enhanced magnetic screening outside the vortex core [15]. The increasing behavior in the\nfield dependence of VLFF due to strong PPB has been already argued by Ichioka and Machida who discussed this\nissue quantitatively by using the quasi-classical approximation where the SC gap and both of the two pair-breaking\neffects are fully taken into account [15]. The qualitative consistency of our result with their result indicates that the\nperturbative expansion with respect to |\u2206| used here is valid in the discussion on VLFF.\nB.\n\nAFM fluctuation induced inside the SC phase\n\nNext, we will show that PPB enhanced sufficiently by increasing the external magnetic field induces AFM fluctuation\ninside the d-wave SC state. Since this novel PPB effect has been already studied thoroughly elsewhere [30] in both\nm \u22a5 H and m k H, in this subsection, we will only give a brief review of this PPB effect with an example of our\nresult in the case with m \u22a5 H.\n(2,2)\nFigure 5 shows the field dependence of the SC-AFM coupling term F\u22060 ,m for \u03b4IC = 0.005 in m \u22a5 H. Since Eq. (12)\n(2,2)\n\ndetermines the AFM instability, negative values of F\u22060 ,m indicate that an AFM ordering or an enhancement of AFM\n(2,2)\n\nfluctuation tends to occur in the SC state. Noting the physical implication of F\u22060 ,m , one can see that, due to PPB\nenhanced by decreasing temperature and increasing field, AFM fluctuation is induced in sufficiently low-temperature\nand high-field region, while, in higher-temperature and lower-field region, the AFM fluctuation is suppressed by the\nSC order. The field hCP at which the AFM fluctuation is strongest is fixed at the Hc2 transition.

Due to\nthe PPB effect, the magnetic flux is concentrated inside the vortex core as a result of the enhanced magnetic screening outside\nit, which is reflected in the enhancement of VLFF shown in Fig. 3.

In obtaining the result, \u03b1M,c = 5.8\nand \u03b4IC = 0.005 are used. The Hc2 (T ) curve obtained is shown in the inset, where an arrow denotes the point at which the Hc2\ntransition changes its nature from the second order to the first one and the FFLO vortex lattice is neglected here. To make it\neasy to grasp which region in the phase diagram is considered, the temperatures t = 0.02, t = 0.06, and t = 0.1 are indicated\nby the left (red) vertical line, the center (blue) one, and the right (green) one, respectively in the inset. PPB enhanced strongly\n(2,2)\nby increasing field and decreasing temperature induces AFM fluctuation inside the SC state. The large energy gain in F\u22060 ,m\njust below the Hc2 transition at the low temperature indicates that the AFM fluctuation gets stronger toward Hc2 (0).\n\nthe Hc2 transition is due to the finite SC energy gap |\u2206| originating from the first order nature of the Hc2 transition.\nThese results suggest that the PPB-induced AFM fluctuation gets stronger toward Hc2 (0) inside the d-wave SC state\nwith finite |\u2206| and that the strong AFM fluctuation with hCP located just below the Hc2 transition at the extremely\nlow temperature causes the quantum critical phenomena around Hc2 (0). It should be emphasized that the result\nobtained here is not accidental to the GL expansion but intrinsic to the present system. This novel effect of strong\nPPB has been theoretically confirmed in the Pauli limit case where |\u2206| is fully taken into account [30]. We note\nthat, in m k H, the AFM fluctuation is also induced inside the SC phase by the PPB effect (see Fig. 4 and Fig.\n9 in Ref. [30]). As a typical example of physical phenomena caused by the PPB-induced AFM fluctuation in the\nSC vortex state, we will discuss effects of the PPB-induced AFM quantum critical fluctuation on VLFF, bearing the\nexperimental data on CeCoIn5 in our mind.\nC.\n\nEffects of AFM fluctuation on VLFF\n\nBelow, we will examine effects of the AFM fluctuation on VLFF. Feynman diagrams for the internal field brought\n(0,2)\nby the AFM fluctuation are shown in Fig. 6 where a wavy line denotes the AFM fluctuation and bm has been\n\n\f15\n\nFIG. 6: Feynman diagrams for the contribution from the AFM fluctuation to the internal magnetic field.

A wavy line\nrepresents the AFM fluctuation.\n\ndropped since it only gives a spatially uniform contribution to the magnetic flux. Then, the spatially varying internal\n(2,2)\n(4)\n(2)\nmagnetic field is written as b\u2206 (r) + b\u2206 (r) + bfluc (r), where\n4 Z\n12\n(2,2)\nD\nE\nX\n|\u03b7|2\nbfluc (r)\n8\u03c0 rH |\u2206|2 X h|m(q)|2 i X (2) iK\u22a5 *r\u22a5 Y \u221e\n2 (2,2)\n\u2212 2 (aj +bj )2\np\n=\n|w\n|\nb\u0302\n(\u03c1\n;\nq,\nq)\ne\nT\ne\nd\u03c1\n.\nj\np\nj\ni\nK\u22a5 ,vp\nK\u22a5\n4\u03c0CGL\n7\u03b6(3) \u03be0 Tc2 q\nTc2\nFS\ni=1 0\nj=1\nK\u22a5 6=0\n\n(53)\nHere, the commensurate AFM fluctuation (\u03b4IC = 0) is assumed for brevity. The properties of the AFM fluctua2\ntion are specified by the AFM\nP correlation function h|m(q)| i which is introduced phenomenologically through the\n2\napproximation h|m(q)| i \u2243 T \u03c9n \u03c7(q, i\u03c9n ) with the familiar form of the susceptibility [38\u201341]\n\u03c7(q, i \u03c9n ) =\n\n\u22122\n\u03be 2 (h, t) \u03beN\n1\n2 ),\nN (0) 1 + \u03be 2 (h, t)|q \u00d7 \u1e91|2 + |\u03c9n |/(\u03930 \u03be \u22122 (h, t) \u03beN\n\n(54)\n\nwhere \u03beN and \u03930 are a length scale and an energy scale characteristic of the AFM fluctuation, respectively, \u03be(h, t) is\nthe correlation length which diverges at an AFM instability, and the two dimensional fluctuation is assumed in Eq.\n(54) based on the experimental data [37]. Since, as we discussed in the previous subsection, the AFM fluctuation\nstrongly enhanced at hCP gets stronger with decreasing temperature, we assume that the AFM instability is located\nat an extremely low temperature and the high field hCP . Then, the correlation length is considered to take the form\n\u03be(h, t) = \u03beN (t + |1 \u2212 h/hCP |)\u22121/2 [41, 42]. We note that the condition \u03be(h, t)\u22122 = 0 corresponds to Eq. (12) which\ndetermines the instability of the PPB-induced AFM order. Since \u03c7(q, i \u03c9n ) has a dominant contribution at q = 0, we\n(2,2)\n(2,2)\nwill calculate the right-hand side of Eq. (53) by using the evaluation b\u0302K\u22a5 ,vp (\u03c1j ; q, q) \u2243 b\u0302K\u22a5 ,vp (\u03c1j ; 0, 0). Then, the\npart relevant to the summation for q in Eq.

In the numerical\nwhere \u03c7R is the retarded susceptibility and the replacement q \u2192 (2\u03c0)\n3\n2\n2\ncalculation below, \u03b5c = 2TP\nc , \u03930 = EF , N (0) = pF /(2\u03c0 vF ), qc = pF are used. We believe that the approximation\n2\nused here, h|m(q)| i \u2243 T \u03c9n \u03c7(q, i\u03c9n ), which corresponds to setting \u03c9n \u2243 0 in the quasiparticle Green's function\nwith an \u03c9n -dependence, properly gives the AFM contribution since \u03c7(q, i \u03c9n ) has a dominant contribution at \u03c9n = 0.\nOn the other hand, it is known that the \u03c9n -dependence in the Green's function produces the imaginary part of the\nself energy of a quasiparticle described by the Feynman diagram (a) in Fig. 6. Since the imaginary part of the self\nenergy, namely, the quasiparticle damping suppresses the PPB effect [23], it cannot be neglected in examining any\nPPB effect. By carrying out the diagrammatic calculation, we can evaluate the imaginary part of the self energy near\nthe Fermi surface as follows:\n\nIm \u03a3R\n\u03c3 (kF , 0) \u2243\n\nh \u03be(h, t) \u0010 \u2206\u03b5 \u0011i2 \u0011\u22121/2\n\u03c0 2 T \u03be(t, h) \u0010\n1\n+\n2\n4 pF \u03beN\n2\u03c0\u03be0 Tc\n\n(56)\n\nwith \u2206\u03b5 = \u2212Tc \u03b4IC + (\u03c3 + \u03c3) ITc (for details, see Appendix III). In the expression (56), a familiar form of the\nquasiparticle damping caused by the AFM spin fluctuation near the hot spot [40] is extended so that it includes the\nZeeman energy shift. Noting that the direction of m relative to H is reflected in \u2206\u03b5, one can see in Eq.

Highest (red), middle (blue), and lowest (green) curves\nare the |F1,1 (h)|2 ones obtained at t = 0.02, t = 0.06, and t = 0.1 in the inset in Fig. 5, respectively. Regarding the parameters\nrelevant to the AFM fluctuation, \u03beN = 0.6\u03be0 with \u03be0 pF = 7.0 and \u03b4IC = 0 are used and hCP = 0.289 is assumed so that the\nlocation of the AFM instability field is below Hc2 (0). In the high-field and low-temperature region, VLFF is enhanced by the\nPPB-induced AFM critical fluctuation.\n\nquasiparticle damping is more effective in m \u22a5 H than in m k H. In examining effects of the AFM fluctuation, we\ntake the quasiparticle damping into account with the substitution \u03b5n \u2192 \u03b5n + sgn(\u03b5n ) Im \u03a3R\n\u03c3 (kF , 0) which is equivalent\nto the replacement\n\u0002\n\u0003\nexp \u2212 2 x Im \u03a3R\n1\n\u03c3 (kF , 0)\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u2192\n(57)\nsinh[2\u03c0t x]\nsinh 2\u03c0t x\n\nin Eqs.

In the evaluation of the amplitude of the SC order parameter \u22060 , the replacement (57) is also used.\nFigure 7 shows the field dependences of VLFF |F1,1 |2 in H k c case with m \u22a5 H (a) and m k H (b), where solid\nand dotted curves correspond to the cases with and without the internal magnetic field brought by the PPB-induced\nAFM fluctuation, respectively, at t = 0.02 [highest (red) curves], t = 0.06 [middle (blue) ones], and t = 0.1 [lowest\n(green) ones]. The AFM instability field hCP is assumed to be located below Hc2 (0) so that hCP is consistent with\nboth the experimental result suggestive of the AFM critical point below Hc2 (0) [3, 18, 19] and our theoretical result\nshown in Fig. 5. In both m \u22a5 H and m k H, VLFF at the low temperature t = 0.02 is remarkably enhanced in\nthe high-field range by the PPB-induced AFM critical fluctuation, and as a result, the slope of the |F1,1 (h)|2 curve\nbecomes sharper. On the other hand, in m \u22a5 H (Fig. 7 (a)), VLFF is rather suppressed by the PPB-induced\nAFM fluctuation at t = 0.06, while, in m k H (Fig. 7 (b)), the enhancement of VLFF due to the AFM fluctuation\ncan be seen at the same temperature. To understand the physical origin of the enhancement and the suppression\nof VLFF due to the PPB-induced AFM fluctuation, spatial distributions of the internal field brought by the AFM\n(2,2)\nfluctuation bfluc (r) in m k H and m \u22a5 H at t = 0.06 and h = 0.25 are shown in Fig. 8 (b) and (c), respectively. For\n(4)\n(2)\ncomparison, the internal field without the AFM contribution b\u2206 (r) + b\u2206 (r) at the same temperature and field is\nalso shown in Fig. 8 (a). In Fig. 8, the contributions from the six Fourier components with the shortest |K\u22a5 |, \u00b1(2, 0),\n\u00b1(1, 1), and \u00b1(1, \u22121), are extracted from the full summation for K\u22a5 so that one can easily grasp the tendency of\n(2)\n(4)\nthe flux distribution. Although, as shown in the inset in (a), b\u2206 (r) + b\u2206 (r) with the full summation for K\u22a5 has\na short length scale structure due to relatively large higher Fourier components, the tendency of the distribution is\n\n\f17\n(a)\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n~\n\n(4)\n\n~\n\n4\n\n~\n\nb\u0394 (r) +b\u0394 (r)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n8\n\n(4)\n\nb\u0394+b\u0394 -80\n\ny\n\n(2,2) ~\n\n2\n0\n\n8\n4\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nx~\n\n2\n\n4\n\n(2,2) ~\n\nb fluc (r)\n\nb fluc (r)\n\n0.5\n0.1\n-0.3\n\n0.3\n0\n-0.3\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n~\n\ny\n\n5\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n~\n\n2\n1\n0\n-1 -2 -1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\ny\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n1\n0\n-1 -2 -1\n\n~\n\nx\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n~\n\nx\n\n3\n\n4\n\n~\n\ny\n\n2\n1\n0\n-1-2 -1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n~\n\nx\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Spatial distributions of the longitudinal internal magnetic field normalized by 4\u03c0CGL without the AFM\n(2)\n(4)\n(2,2)\n(2,2)\ncontribution b\u2206 (r\u0303) + b\u2206 (r\u0303) (a), the internal field brought by the AFM fluctuation bfluc (r\u0303) in m k H (b), and bfluc (r\u0303) in\nm \u22a5 H (c) at t = 0.06 and h = 0.25 in the case with \u03b1M,c = 5.8, where dominant contributions coming from the Fourier\ncomponents \u00b1(2, 0), \u00b1(1, 1), and \u00b1(\u22121, 1) are extracted from the full internal fields. The inset of (a) shows the full internal field\n(2)\n(4)\nb\u2206 + b\u2206 . Although higher Fourier components become relatively large at low temperatures and express the flux distribution\nat short length scales, the tendency of the distribution is well described by the six components listed above. Enhancement of\n(2)\n(4)\nthe magnetic flux in the vortex core region and its reduction outside the vortex core are commonly seen in both b\u2206 (r\u0303) + b\u2206 (r\u0303)\n(2,2)\n(2,2)\nand bfluc (r\u0303) in m k H, while, in bfluc (r\u0303) in m \u22a5 H, the magnetic flux is enhanced outside the vortex core. The difference in\n(2,2)\nbfluc (r\u0303) in two cases, m k H and m \u22a5 H, is reflected in VLFF shown in Fig. 7.\n\nwell described by the six components listed above. As one can see in Fig. 8, enhancement of the magnetic flux in the\n(2)\n(4)\n(2,2)\nvortex core region and its reduction outside the vortex core are commonly seen in both b\u2206 (r) + b\u2206 (r) and bfluc (r)\n(2,2)\nin m k H, while, in bfluc (r) in m \u22a5 H, the magnetic flux is enhanced outside the vortex core, in other words, the\nmagnetic screening outside the vortex core is suppressed. This result suggests that the enhancement (suppression)\nof VLFF due to the AFM fluctuation corresponds to the promotion (reduction) of the magnetic screening outside\nthe vortex core. Further, comparing Fig. 7 (a) with Fig. 5, we can see that it depends on a sign of the SC-AFM\n(2,2)\n(2,2)\ncoupling term F\u22060 ,m whether the AFM contribution bfluc (r) promotes the magnetic screening or prevents it. In the\n(2,2)\n\n(2,2)\n\nhigh-field and low-temperature region where F\u22060 ,m is negative, bfluc (r) enhances VLFF, while, in lower-field and\n(2,2)\n\n(2,2)\n\nhigher-temperature region where F\u22060 ,m is positive, bfluc (r) suppresses VLFF. Noting that, from the viewpoint of the\n(2,2)\n\nSC order, negative values of F\u22060 ,m indicate that the stability of the SC order is enhanced by the AFM fluctuation,\nwe can understand the mechanism of the enhancement of VLFF due to the PPB-induced AFM fluctuation as follows:\nthe SC state becomes more stable due to the PPB-induced AFM fluctuation, then the SC magnetic screening is\npromoted, and as a result, VLFF is enhanced by the internal magnetic field originating from the promoted screening\ncurrent. The falling-down behavior toward the Hc2 transition in the |F1,1 (h)|2 curves is more remarkable in m \u22a5 H\nthan in m k H, which is due to the fact that the amplitude of the SC energy gap is much suppressed by the stronger\nquasiparticle damping in m \u22a5 H.\nThe increasing behavior in the field dependence of VLFF becomes remarkable due to the enhanced magnetic\nscreening caused by the PPB-induced AFM fluctuation. Further, the obtained field dependences of VLFF in lowering\ntemperature in both m \u22a5 H and m k H, are consistent with the experimental data on CeCoIn5 [14]. Considering\nthese fact, we could conclude that the strong AFM fluctuation around Hc2 (0) observed in CeCoIn5 in H k c is the\nPPB-induced AFM fluctuation enhanced strongly by increasing field and decreasing temperature and that the abrupt\nincrease of VLFF at high fields is a consequence of the magnetic screening enhanced by the PPB-induced AFM critical\nfluctuation.\nConcerning the direction of the AFM moment vector m, we cannot rule out alternative possibilities of m \u22a5 H or\nm k H by comparing our theoretical result with the experimental data. However, from the experimental data showing\nthat the configuration m k c is realized in H k ab [25, 26], it is inferred that m is locked along c-axis. Further, noting\nthat the AFM fluctuation in the normal state is suppressed by the Zeeman effect in m k H while it is not affected by\nthe Zeeman effect in m \u22a5 H, the absence of the AFM order in the SC phase in H k c seems to be understood as a\nresult of the suppression of the AFM fluctuation with m k c in the normal state.\n\n\f18\nIV.\n\nANTIFERROMAGNETIC ORDER IN H k ab\n\nIn this section, we discuss a possible AFM order realized in vortex states in the d-wave superconductor with\nstrong PPB. Throughout this section, we assume that the AFM moment vector is perpendicular to the magnetic field\nm \u22a5 H k ab, since the configuration m k c has been established in the AFM order observed in the HFLT phase of\nCeCoIn5 in H k ab case. In the parallel field, strong PPB induces the longitudinal FFLO vortex lattice state in the\nHFLT corner in the phase diagram [35] and the FFLO region is large so that it may not be ignored. Although the\nFFLO state is not taken into account in the analysis on the PPB-induced AFM order in the SC vortex lattice, we\nwill discuss effects of FFLO spatial structures on the AFM order and also on VLFF later.\nA.\n\nModulated antiferromagnetic order in the SC vortex lattice\n\nBelow, we consider the situation where the PPB-induced AFM fluctuation becomes so strong that an AFM order\n(2)\n(2,2) \u0001\nappears inside the SC state, i.e., Fm + F\u22060 ,m /m2 < 0. Because the SC gap function has the vortex-lattice\nmodulation, an AFM order with a spatial modulation synchronized with the vortex lattice is expected to appear\ninstead of the spatially uniform AFM order. Possible modulated AFM orders are classified into two types: the AFM\norder localized in the normal-state region, namely, in vortex cores and the one coexistent with the SC order. Since\nwe consider the spatial distribution of the PPB-induced AFM order in the presence of a potential brought by the SC\n(2,2)\nvortex lattice through the SC-AFM coupling term F\u2206,m , it is natural to assume that m(r) takes the following form:\n\u0012\nh\ni\u0013\nX\nm\n\u2032 (2)\nm(X, Y ) = q\n1+ w\nTK\u22a5 exp iK\u22a5 * (X, Y ) ,\n(58)\nP\u2032\n(2) 2\nK\u22a5 6=0\n1 + w2\nK\u22a5 6=0 |TK\u22a5 |\n\nor equivalently,\n\nm(q) = q\n1 + w2\n\nm\nP\u2032\n\n(2) 2\nK\u22a5 6=0 |TK\u22a5 |\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(2)\n\u03b4q,0 + w TK\u22a5 \u03b4q,K\u0303\u22a5 6=0 ,\n\n(59)\n\nP\u2032\n(2)\n(2,2)\nwhere w is a variational parameter to be determined by minimizing (Fm + F\u22060 ,m )/m2 , and K\u22a5 6=0 denotes the\nK\u22a5 -summation only for the lowest Fourier components, (m1 , m2 ) = \u00b1(1, 1), \u00b1(1, \u22121), and \u00b1(2, 0). We believe that\nthe restricted summation for K\u22a5 gives correct results because the contribution from higher Fourier components will\nbe negligibly small and will not affect the results. It should be noted that negative (positive) values of w indicate the\nAFM order enhanced (suppressed) in the vortex core.\nIn obtaining spatial structures of AFM orders, we assume that the magnetic flux is uniform. Since, in general,\nan inhomogeneous internal field is induced by a spatially modulated AFM order, the induced inhomogeneous field\nmay affect the spatial structure of the AFM order. In this study, however, we neglect the internal field brought by\n(0,2)\nthe AFM order for the following two reasons: First, the leading order AFM contribution bm (r) vanishes because\nof the configuration m \u22a5 H and does not affect the magnetic flux at all. Second, the internal field brought by the\n(2,2)\nAFM order thorough the SC-AFM coupling b\u2206,m (r) is considered to be negligibly small since, as we will see later,\nthe transition to the AFM order occurs at a relatively high field so that the amplitude of the AFM order parameter\nwill not grow up to a large value with increasing field.\nFigure 9 shows an example of the temperature-field phase diagram of the PPB-induced AFM order inside the d-wave\nSC vortex lattice state in H k ab, where a thin (red) solid curve and a dashed (red) one denote the transition curve to\nthe AFM order with a vortex-lattice modulation and the one to the spatially uniform AFM order, respectively, and\nboth of them are second order transition curves. As one can see in the main panel of Fig. 9, the stability region of\nthe PPB-induced AFM order is expanded by the modulation synchronized with the vortex lattice, and an example\nof the spatial structure of the modulated AFM order is shown in the inset of Fig. 9. As we will discuss later, the\nPPB-induced AFM order is not localized in the vortex core but coexistent with the SC order.

Figure 10\nsuggests two important results. First, the AFM order with the vortex-lattice modulation becomes more stable in the\nvortex state than the uniform one. Second, as clearly seen in Fig. 10 (a), in the case with \u03b1M,ab = 7.5, the AFM\norder appearing inside the SC state lowers the free energy, while, in the case with \u03b1M,ab = 0.01, it never lowers the\nfree energy. In the case with weak PPB, the conventional competitive nature between SC and AFM orders is reflected\nin the free energy cost and negative values of w, which suggests that, in systems with a sufficiently large TN /Tc in\n\n\f19\n\n0.85\n0.75\n\nh\n\n1.2\n\n~ 2\n|\u0394(x)|\u0002/\u03942\n\n0.8\n\n0.65\n\nvortex core\n\n~ 2 2\n0.4 |m(x)| / m\n\n0.55\n\n0\n0.5\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n~\nx\n\n0.05\n\nt\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0.06\n\n(2)\n\n(2,2)\n\n(Fm + F\u03940 , m )/m2\n\nFIG. 9: (Color online) Example of the numerically obtained temperature-field phase diagram of the PPB-induced AFM order\ninside the d-wave SC vortex lattice state in H k ab case, where a thick (black) solid curve and a thin (red) solid one denote the\nfirst order Hc2 transition and the second order transition to the AFM order with a spatial modulation commensurate with the\nvortex lattice structure, respectively. For comparison, the onset of the spatially uniform AFM order in the SC vortex lattice\nis also shown as a dashed (red) curve. The parameters used in obtaining the phase diagram are \u03b1M,ab = 7.5, \u03b4IC = 0.001,\nand TN /Tc = 0.027.

For\ncomparison, results in the case with \u03b1M,ab = 0.01 are also shown in the figures as dotted (green) curves. In (a), one can see\nthat the occurrence of the AFM order in the high-field SC phase lowers the free energy in the case with strong PPB, while, in\nthe case with weak PPB, it never lowers the free energy. Further, as shown in (b), the optimized value of w is positive in the\ncase with strong PPB, suggesting the AFM order coexistent with the SC order, while, in the case with weak PPB, the familiar\ncompetition between the two orders is indicated by negative values of w.\n\nzero field, the AFM order localized in the vortex cores, i.e., in the normal-state region where |\u2206| = 0 can appear\n[43, 44] as shown in Fig. 11 (c). In contrast, as denoted by a solid curve in Fig. 10 (b), optimized values of the\nvariational parameter in the case with strong PPB are positive, indicating the AFM order coexistent with the SC\norder. An example of the spatial distribution of this PPB-induced AFM order is shown in Fig. 11 (b), where the\nspatial structure of the vortex lattice is shown in Fig. 11 (a). The AFM order is suppressed in the vortex core and\nenhanced in the region with large |\u2206|.

The figures (b) and (c) correspond to w = 0.63 and w = \u22120.15,\nrespectively. In the case with strong PPB, the AFM order coexists with the SC order while, in the case with weak PPB, the\nAFM order competes with the SC order and is localized in the vortex cores.\n\nbecomes much stable in the SC phase as |\u03b4IC | is increased [8]. On the other hand, the incommensurate wave vector\nobserved in the AFM order appearing inside the HFLT phase of CeCoIn5 [25, 26] seems to originate from the deviation\nfrom the perfect nesting condition of the Fermi surface [30], which suggests that the deviation |\u03b4IC | is large enough\nand the momentum dependence in |\u03b4IC | should be taken into account in the detailed discussion on the AFM order in\nthe HFLT SC phase.\nOur result obtained here for the PPB-induced AFM order in the SC vortex lattice is consistent with recent NMR\ndata suggesting that the AFM order in the HFLT phase of CeCoIn5 is spatially extended without being localized in\nthe normal-state region [29]. Although the longitudinal FFLO vortex lattice state is ignored in the above calculation,\nthe theoretical study taking account of the longitudinal FFLO modulation along H without in-plane vortex-lattice\nstructures included shows that, at least in the high-field side of the FFLO state, the AFM order is not localized in\nthe FFLO nodal planes on which |\u2206| = 0, but coexistent with the SC order [30]. These results obtained in the two\napproaches, which are complementary to each other, suggest that the PPB-induced AFM order coexistent with the\nSC order may be stabilized at least in the high-field side of the longitudinal FFLO vortex lattice state.\nB.\n\nVLFF in the modulated AFM order\n\nWe will briefly discuss effects of the PPB-induced AFM order on VLFF. A red solid (dashed) curve in Fig. 12\ndenotes the field dependence of VLFF at t = 0.03 in Fig. 9 in the presence (absence) of the PPB-induced AFM\norder modulating with the vortex lattice. Here, the variational parameter w in Eq.(58) is determined by minimizing\nFGL (\u22060 , m) \u2212 FGL (\u22060 , 0), while the amplitude of the AFM order parameter |m| is obtained by using Eq. (13). The\nform factor is enhanced by the PPB-induced AFM order as a result of the additional magnetic screening brought\nby the occurrence of the PPB-induced AFM order, like in the case only with the PPB-induced AFM fluctuation\nexamined in Sec. III. However, the enhancement of VLFF brought by the AFM order is quite small compared with\nthat brought by the AFM critical fluctuation. We expect an additional AFM fluctuation around the nonvanishing\nAFM order parameter, which has not been taken into account in obtaining Fig. 12, to further enhance VLFF.\nC.\n\nInternal magnetic field in the longitudinal FFLO vortex lattice state\n\nSo far, we have not examined effects of the longitudinal FFLO structure of the SC order parameter on the internal\nfield and VLFF which should be seen in the HFLT corner in the phase diagram [35]. Below, we examine the flux\ndistribution in the longitudinal FFLO vortex lattice although, in turn, an AFM order will be neglected for brevity in\ncontrast to the case of Fig.12.\nIn the longitudinal FFLO vortex lattice state, the SC gap function is expressed in the form\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u2206(r) = \u2206\u03c60 (X, Y ) 2 cos Q Z\n(60)\n\nwith the modulation wave vector Q\u1e90 parallel to the magnetic field.

A red solid (dashed) curve corresponds to the result in the presence (absence) of\nthe PPB-induced AFM order with the vortex-lattice modulation. Although VLFF is enhanced by the occurrence of the AFM\norder, the enhancement is not so remarkable compared with that brought by the PPB-induced AFM fluctuation.

(61), the transverse magnetic field is induced by the finite FFLO modulation (Q 6= 0) and the\nlongitudinal magnetic flux varies along the FFLO modulation. An example of the flux distribution in the longitudinal\nFFLO vortex lattice is shown in Fig. 13 (a). One can see that outgoing and incoming fields are induced and\ncorrespondingly, the longitudinal magnetic flux varies along the FFLO modulation. The experimentally measured\nVLFF is expected to reflect the internal field which is spatially averaged over the range [\u2212\u03c0/Q, \u03c0/Q] in the Z direction.\nThen, the transverse incoming and outgoing fields cancel each other. The |\u2206|4 contribution to the spatially averaged\n\u0002\n\u0001\n(4)\n(4)\ninternal magnetic field is given by replacing b\u0302K\u22a5 ,vp (\u03c1j ) in Eq.

Figure 13 (b) shows typical |F1,1 (h)|2 curves in the\nlongitudinal FFLO vortex lattice without an AFM order, where solid (blue) and dotted curves correspond to the\nresults with and without the FFLO longitudinal modulation, respectively, and the arrow denotes the FFLO transition\nfield. In obtaining the result, the modulation Q is determined selfconsistently from the GL free energy functional\n[35], and further, it is confirmed that the FFLO transition is of second order. As one can see in the figure, VLFF\nis suppressed by the longitudinal FFLO modulation and the slope of the |F1,1 (h)|2 curve changes its sign quite close\nto the FFLO transition field. An abrupt falling down behavior in VLFF has been experimentally observed near the\ntransition between the low field SC phase and the HFLT one in H k ab case [45], which seems to imply the formation of\nthe longitudinal FFLO vortex lattice state in the HFLT phase. On the other hand, an AFM order and corresponding\nAFM fluctuation which are not taken into account in the above argument about the FFLO state may affect the result.\nIt should be noted, however, that the quasiparticle damping brought by the AFM critical fluctuation should suppress\nthe PPB effect so that the onset of the FFLO transition field in the above calculation should be shifted to a higher\nfield and that the FFLO region should be narrower. In order to investigate the high-field and low-temperature SC\nphase in H k ab, further studies taking account of the longitudinal FFLO vortex lattice, the PPB-induced AFM order,\nand fluctuation around the AFM transition consistently will be needed.\nIn the last of this subsection, we will discuss effects of the longitudinal FFLO modulation on VLFF in H k c case.\nThe HFLT phase appearing just below the Hc2 (T ) curve as a narrow region in H k c case [16, 24] has been considered\n\n\f22\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0.2\n\nFFLO\n~\nz\n\n0.15\n\n|F1,1|\n\n2\u03c0/Q\n\n~\nx\n\n2\n\n0.1\n0.05\n\n~\nz\n\n0\n\nvortex\n~\nx\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\nh\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\nFIG. 13: (Color online) Spatial flux distribution (a) and the |F1,1 (h)|2 curves normalized by (4\u03c0CGL )2 (b) in the longitudinal\nFFLO vortex lattice state. The AFM order and fluctuation are not taken into account in obtaining these results. The structure\nof this state is schematically shown in (a) where a solid (black) vertical line, a vertical wavy (green) curve, and horizontal dashed\nlines indicate a vortex line extending along the applied field, the FFLO modulation, and the nodal planes on which |\u2206| = 0,\nrespectively. The left upper (lower) panel in (a) shows the numerically obtained transverse field on the surface QZ = \u03c0/4\n(QZ = \u2212\u03c0/4) in the FFLO state with 2\u03c0\u03be0 Q = 0.55 appearing at t = 0.1 and h = 0.65, where a (black) dot denotes the vortex\ncenter. An outgoing field from the vortex center is seen at QZ = \u03c0/4, while, on the surface QZ = \u2212\u03c0/4, rather an incoming\nfield is induced. Correspondingly, the longitudinal magnetic flux at the vortex core denoted by vertical (blue) arrows varies\nalong the applied field with its minimum at the nodal plane and maximum at the surface on which |\u2206| is the largest. In (b),\n(blue) solid and (blue and black) dotted curves denote the |F1,1 (h)|2 ones with and without the longitudinal FFLO modulation\nat t = 0.1, respectively, and the arrow denotes the corresponding second order transition field to the longitudinal FFLO vortex\nstate. The VLFF is suppressed due to the FFLO spatial modulation of the SC order parameter.\n\nto be a realization of the longitudinal FFLO vortex lattice [17]. On the other hand, VLFF obtained in the neutron\nscattering experiment does not show any structure around the transition between the HFLT phase and the lower field\nphase [14], in contrast to the abrupt falling down behavior in H k ab case discussed above. The absence of a precursor\nof the FFLO state in VLFF in H k c case may be due to the fact that the effect of the FFLO modulation on VLFF is\ntoo small just above the FFLO transition to be seen. Although VLFF should be suppressed by the FFLO modulation\nQ, drastic suppression cannot be seen because, in H k c case, the stability region of the FFLO state is quite narrow\nand Q cannot grow up to a large value. We believe that, if VLFF is detected in sufficiently high resolution, the onset\nof the FFLO transition should be observed in VLFF in H k c case.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAntiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation and order induced inside a d-wave superconducting (SC) phase by strong\nPauli-paramagnetic pair-breaking (PPB) [8] have been theoretically studied, focusing on how they are affected by\nspatial modulations of a SC vortex lattice. Based on the microscopic calculation taking account of both orbital and\nparamagnetic pair-breaking effects, we have shown that, with increasing field and decreasing temperature, the SC\nvortex lattice state becomes more stable by inducing AFM fluctuation inside it: From the viewpoint of the SC order,\nthe magnetic screening is promoted by the induced AFM fluctuation in the high-field SC phase. In other words, the\nAFM order can more easily appear inside the SC vortex lattice state than in the normal state. These implications have\nbeen concretely discussed in connection with the anomalous SC phenomena observed in CeCoIn5 . First, in H k c case\nwhere the AFM quantum critical behavior around Hc2 (0) is experimentally observed, such appearance of the AFM\nfluctuation in the SC state in higher fields has been explained as a result of the PPB enhanced with increasing the\nfield. Then, it is found that the vortex lattice form factor (VLFF) is enhanced by the additional magnetic screening\nbrought by the coupling between the induced AFM fluctuation and the spatial modulation of the SC vortex lattice\nand that the VLFF's enhancement becomes much remarkable as the AFM instability is approached. The obtained\ntemperature and field dependences of VLFF are consistent with the experimental result [13, 14], which suggests the\nanomalous field dependence of VLFF observed in the experiments is a consequence of the PPB-induced AFM critical\nfluctuation. Second, in H k ab case where an AFM order with m \u22a5 H appears inside the SC phase in CeCoIn5 , it is\nfound that the vortex-lattice modulation promotes the AFM fluctuation and that, as a result, a spatially modulated\nAFM order synchronized with the vortex lattice is stabilized in the SC vortex state. In contrast to the conventional\n\n\f23\ncompetitive nature between the AFM and SC orders, the PPB-induced AFM order in the vortex lattice coexists with\nthe nonvanishing SC order parameter and does not localize in the vortex cores. The spatial modulation peculiar to\nthe longitudinal FFLO state, which seems to be realized in the HFLT phase of CeCoIn5 [29], has been neglected in our\nanalysis on the AFM order. According to the theoretical study taking account of the longitudinal FFLO modulation\nin the Pauli limit without vortex lattice structures included [30], a possible PPB-induced AFM order in the highfield side of the FFLO state is not localized in the FFLO nodal plane but prefers to coexist with the nonvanishing\nSC order parameter. The unconventional coexistence of the AFM and SC orders, obtained in the two approaches\ncomplementary to each other, is consistent with a picture on the HFLT phase of CeCoIn5 suggested from the recent\nNMR data [29]. Further, our study on effects of the longitudinal FFLO spatial modulation and the AFM order\non VLFF performed additionally has shown that, as well as the AFM fluctuation, the AFM order enhances VLFF,\nwhile the longitudinal FFLO modulation leads to a significant reduction of VLFF similar to that seen in CeCoIn5 .\nThese results on the magnetic properties in high field superconductors with strong PPB imply that the HFLT state\nof CeCoIn5 is a coupled phase composed of a PPB-induced AFM order and the d-wave SC order accompanied by the\nlongitudinal FFLO modulation.\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nWe are grateful to Y.

(29) and derive equations useful in incorporating the\norbital pair-breaking effect. In the case with H k \u1e91 (H k \u0177), the vector potential can be expressed as A0 = (0, Hx, 0)\n\u22122\n\u22122\n(A0 = (Hz, 0, 0)), and then, [\u03a0\u221ax , \u03a0y ] = \u2212irH\n([\u03a0z , \u03a0x ] = \u2212irH\n) is satisfied. In H k \u1e91 case, by introducing the\noperators \u03a0\u00b1 = rH (\u03a0x \u00b1 i\u03a0y )/ 2, we obtain\nh\ni\n|\u03b7|2\n2\n\u2217\nexp iA Tc\u22121 vp * \u03a0 = e\u2212 2 A eiA \u03b7 \u03a0+ eiA \u03b7\u03a0\u2212 ,\neiA \u03b7\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03a0+\n\n= e(iA\u03b7\n\n\u2217\n\n\u221a\nrH /2)2 [\u03a0x ,i\u03a0y ] \u2212(A \u03b7 \u2217 rH / 2) \u03a0y\n\ne\n\nei(A \u03b7\n\n\u2217\n\n\u221a\nrH / 2) \u03a0x\n\n,\n\n(63)\n\nwhere the operator identity e[\u00c2,B\u0302] = e\u2212[\u00c2,B\u0302]/2 e\u00c2 eB\u0302 is used. In H k \u0177 case, (\u03a0x , \u03a0y ) is replaced by (\u03b3 \u22121/2 \u03a0z , \u03b3 1/2 \u03a0x )\nin Eq. (63). Equation (29) is obtained by using Eq. (63). Since the Fourier transformation of \u03c60 (X + \u03b1rH , Y )\u03c6\u22170 (X +\n\u03b2rH , Y ) with the reciprocal lattice vector K\u22a5 = (Kx , Ky ) is calculated as\nZ\nh K r\ni\nh K r\ni\n2\ndX dY\n1\nx H\ny H\n(2)\n\u03c60 (X + \u03b1rH , Y )\u03c6\u22170 (X + \u03b2rH , Y )e\u2212iK\u22a5 *(X,Y ) = TK\u22a5 e\u2212 4 (\u03b1\u2212\u03b2) exp i\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2) exp \u2212\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) ,\nLX LY\n2\n2\n\u0012\ni\u0013\nh 1\ni\n\u03c0 Ky rH h Ky rH\nk\n(2)\nexp \u2212 |K\u22a5 rH |2 ,\n(64)\nTK\u22a5 = \u03b4 Ky rH + k K r ,even | Ky rH :integer cos\n+ Kx rH\nx H\nk\n\u03c0\nk\n2 k\nk\n\u03c0\n4\nwe obtain\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0015\n\u2020\nvp * \u03a01 \u03b1 + vp * \u03a02 \u03b2 \u03c60 (s1 )\u03c6\u22170 (s2 )|si \u2192(X,Y )\nexp\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n2\n\u22172\n2\n2\n1\n= e\u2212 2 \u03b1 (|\u03b7| \u2212\u03b7 )+\u03b2 (|\u03b7|\u2212\u03b7 ) \u03c60 (X + s\u03b5 \u03b1\u03b7 \u2217 2rH , Y )\u03c6\u22170 (X \u2212 s\u03b5 \u03b2\u03b7 2rH , Y )\n\u0014\n\u0011\u0015\niX\n\u0010 (\u03b7 * K r )\nh |\u03b7|2\n(\u03b7 \u00d7 K\u22a5 rH )z\n\u22a5 H\n(2) iK\u22a5 *(X,Y )\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) + i\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2) .
