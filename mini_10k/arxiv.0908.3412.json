Polynitrogen molecules are formed by a\ncombination of lower order bonds and while decaying into dinitrogen (N2 ) molecules, they\nrelease enormous amount of energy and are environmentally safe.\nOver last few decades, there have been consistent efforts to predict new exotic forms\nof all-nitrogen molecules using various experimental and theoretical techniques[3, 4, 5, 6].\nThe higher members of nitrogen cluster family (Nn for n>3) are unstable in the free space\nand therefore present a challenge to their synthesis. In 1999, Christe et al.[7] synthesized\nsuccessfully a N5+ salt N + AsF \u2212 which is third readily accessible homonuclear polynitrogen\nspecies. Subsequently, the same group reported the stability of N5+ SbF6\u2212 up to 70o C and its\nrelative insensitivity to impact [8]. This discovery opened a new dimension to explore neutral\npolynitrogen compounds and basis for the first synthesis of stable nitrogen allotropes.\nNitrogen rich compounds such as nitrogen hydrides (Nn Hm ) (n>m) could also be used\nas starting materials to produce Nn species, since N4 H + , N4 H6 and N4 H4 [9, 10, 11] species\nare stable and their subsequent deprotonation may lead to the formation of neutral N4 .\nSimilarly, the oxidation of nitrogen oxide N4 O which is stable and has been observed experimentally [12], would also lead to the formation of N4 . Further, it has been suggested\nthat higher Nn could be synthesized via direct or indirect excitation of electronic states in\nliquid and solid nitrogen followed by collision addition of a ground state N and excited Nn\u22121\nor Nn\u22122 thereby forming higher Nn compounds. For example, by combining different Nn\nmoieties such as N5 and N3 might lead to formation of N8 species [13] and N5\u2212 N5+ may\nform N10 [14, 15]. In 2002, Cacace et al. [16] demonstrated the existence of the tetranitrogen molecule (N4 ) as a metastable species whose life time exceeds 1 \u03bcs at 298K. The\nidentification of N4 represents the first addition in nearly half a century to the family of\nthe polynitrogen molecules. Hammerl and Klapotke [17] also reported a combined theoretical and experimental NMR study on nitrogen rich compounds. At the most fundamental\nlevel, a molecule will exist only if it has high enough energy barrier that keeps it away from\ndissociation.\nThis possibility has been explored theoretically. Various novel polynitrogen species have\n2\n\n\fbeen studied in variety of forms such as cyclic, acyclic or caged conformations. The species\ninvestigated include ionic clusters [18, 19, 20], cylinders [21], cages [22, 23, 24, 25], nanoneedles [26]and helices[27]. Isomers of smaller systems N7 [28], N10 [29] and N12 [30] have\nalso been reported theoretically in free space. Majority of these studies have focused on\nthe evaluation of these novel forms of molecular nitrogen. However, Wang et al.[31] has\ndescribed the possible synthesis route for all-nitrogen systems. Dixon et al.[32] has successfully demonstrated the ability of the theory to predict the stability of such compounds. In\nspite of these efforts, so far no higher members (n>4) of polynitrogen family in free space\nhave been synthesized experimentally . The present difficulties in synthesizing the polynitrogen molecules motivates us to look for new avenues to realize the success of polynitrogen\nmolecules as a possible HEDM.\nFurther, the new polymeric forms of nitrogen have also been explored in extreme conditions of high pressure and temperature. The application of high pressure to nitrogen\nsystem leads to destruction of covalent bonds and may lead to formation of intermediate\npolymeric network of single and double bonded atoms which has been verified experimentally [33, 34, 35, 36]. Using ab initio calculations, other forms of polymeric nitrogen such\nas Black Phosphorous (BP) [37], A7 [38] , metallic[39], simple tetragonal phase [39] and\nCubic Gauche (CG) form [36] have been proposed at extreme conditions. The CG form has\nalso been observed experimentally [40]. Therefore, the success of ab initio studies [41] in\npredicting new polymeric phases of nitrogen in extreme conditions motivates us to study\npolynitrogen in other physical environment such as in confinement.\nMore recently in 2008, nitrogen has been predicted to exist in polymeric form (N8 ) in\nconfinement of nanostructures i.e. Carbon Nanotubes. They proposed N8 stabilizes as a\nchain which is stable up to room temperature [42]. Therefore, apart from extreme condition of high temperature and pressure, confinement offers an alternate environment for\nstabilization of polynitrogen compounds. Since the environment of C60 has been extensively\nstudied by our group [43, 44, 45, 46] as well as others [47, 48] it offers a new possibility for\npolynitrogen encapsulation. The C60 cage has already been explored for endohedral doping\nwith alkali metals [49], transitional metals [50], non-metals [51] and noble gases [52]. Among\nall endohedral complexes, nitrogen-doped C60 are quite interesting and needs further investigation. As per our knowledge, N@C60 is the only endohedral complex which have been\nexplored extensively theoretically [47, 48, 53, 55] as well as experimentally [56]. However,\n3\n\n\fN2 @C60 was successfully synthesized using pressure heating [57] and one isolated study of\nits stabilization energy has been recently reported [58]. Till date, the higher members of\nnitrogen family (n>2) have not been explored at endohedral position in C60 . New techniques\nhave been developed to deal with nitrogen (as impurity) in nanostructures such as chemical\nvaporization deposition (CVD) method [60] which is capable of synthesizing nitrogen doped\ncarbon nanotubes. And recently in 2008, C57 N3 was reported using surface-catalyzed cyclodehydrogenation from aromatic precursors [61] and further expressing a strong possibility\nof synthesizing other nitrogen-based hetero and endohedral fullerenes. Keeping this in view,\nfurther efforts are needed to be invested in both experimental and theoretical sides to help in\ndesigning new ways for generating Nn compounds and understand their stability in different\nenvironments.\nIn this paper, we report the results of our ab initio calculations on Nn @C60 for n\u226416,\nwhich describes the novel possibility of stabilizing the higher members of all-nitrogen\nmolecules in confined environment of C60 . We intend to show that C60 can act as an ideal\ncandidate to trap nitrogen in polymeric form and can be used as a possible high energy density material. The present study would provide some valuable information for synthesizing\nmore stable all-nitrogen clusters to develop the novel materials for future.\n\n2.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS AND VALIDATION\n\nWe have used the Spanish Initiative for Electronic Simulation with thousands of atoms\n(SIESTA) computational code[62] which is based on numerical atomic orbital density functional theory method [63, 64, 65]. We have used 1s2 , 2s2 , 2p1x , 2p1y , 2p1z (4S3/2 ) configuration\nof atomic nitrogen corresponding to spin quartet state which is consistent with the experimental observation [56]. The calculations are carried out using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) that implements Becke gradient exchange correlation functional (BLYP)[66].\nCore electrons are replaced by non-local, norm-conserving pseudopotentials factorized in the\nKleinman-Bylander form [67], whereas valence electrons are described using linear combination of numerical pseudo atomic orbitals of the Sankey- Niklewski type [68] but generalized\nfor multiple-\u03b6 and polarization functions. In this work, we have used a split valence double-\u03b6\n(DZP) basis set with energy shift equal to 100 meV. The real space cutoff grid energy is\ntaken as 200 Ry. Periodic boundary conditions have been considered using simple cubic shell\n4\n\n\fof 2 nm that is large enough to avoid any significant spurious interactions with periodically\nrepeated images.\nWe first performed test calculations on the C60 and N2 molecules. In C60 , we found the\nC=C and C-C bond distances as 0.140 nm and 0.146 nm in agreement with experimental\nvalues [69]. The ionization potential and electron affinity were found to be 6.9 eV and 2.70\neV, in good agreement with experimental values of 7.5 \u00b1 0.01[70] and 2.689 \u00b1 0.008 [71]\nrespectively. In N2 molecule, the N-N bond distance and ionization potential are found to\nbe 0.112 nm and 15.43 eV which are in good agreement with experimental values of 0.115\nnm and 15.60 eV respectively [72].\nWe now proceed with the investigation of nitrogen clusters inside C60 . We started with\ndifferent initial atomic configurations of Nn for n = 1-16. The following considerations\nwere taken into account while starting and determining the final structure for particular\nconfiguration. (a) Nitrogen atoms were placed sufficiently away from the walls of C60 so\nthat there is no likelihood to form any C-N bond. (b) Nitrogen atoms were allowed to\nform bonds among themselves and make polynitrogen compounds. (c) Each structure was\nallowed to relax till forces on each atom converges up to 0.001 eV/\u00c5. (d) The structure with\nminimum energy is considered as the final stable polymeric form of nitrogen. (e) All the\noptimized nitrogen clusters inside C60 were also relaxed in free space at 0K. (f) The structures\nof Nn @C60 were also relaxed at room temperature (300K) to confirm their stability (g) The\nspin polarized calculations were performed on final stable polymeric Nn @C60 to determine\nthe spin states (h) Also harmonic vibrational frequency analysis on all optimized structures\nwas performed to further ensure their ground state geometries.\n\n3.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe optimized ground state structures of polynitrogen compounds inside C60 are shown\nin Figure 1-3. We started our calculation with single nitrogen, the nitrogen was placed at\ndifferent positions inside C60 and the SCF total energy isosurface is explored throughout\nregion inside C60 . We found the atomic nitrogen at center as stable structure with small\nzero point vibrations. Since the atomic nitrogen is highly reactive so if we place nitrogen\nat a distance of more than 0.150 nm from center of cage, it has tendency to form a weak\ncovalent bond of the order of 0.154 nm with two adjacent carbon atoms of hexagon-hexagon\n5\n\n\finterface of C60 inner surface[73]. When two nitrogen atoms are placed inside C60 at different\npositions, they form N2 molecule which is found to stabilize at the center of the C60 . The\nresultant structure is N2 molecule with N\u2261N bond distance of 0.112 nm which is same as\nin free space.\nIn N3 @C60 , N3 in linear form with D\u221eh symmetry is found to be stable at the center\nwith N-N bond length of 0.119 nm. However, the triangular structure D3h is found to be\nanother stable isomer inside C60 . Interestingly, most of initial N3 configurations including\nthe combination of N2 and single N at distance results in an isosceles triangular structure\nwith bondlengths of 0.133 nm and 0.158 nm and bond angles 53.5o and 73.1o respectively.\nThe energy difference between both the structures is of the order of 0.9 eV. N4 is found to\nexist as two dimers of N2 with bond length of 0.111 nm and placed at a distance of 0.226 nm\nsymmetrically across the center of cage. The arrangement of two N2 molecules on either side\nof center of C60 may be explained on the basis of extra stability of N2 and its reluctance to\nform lower order bond. The structure with Td and D2h symmetry are found to be the other\nstable isomers. However, in free state N4 has been predicted to be stable in C2h \u2212 T , Td\nand D2h symmetries respectively [74]. N5 is found to be stable at center in perfect pentagon\nshape having D5h symmetry with each bond length of 0.132 nm and bond angle of 108.0\no\n\n. We tried various initial configurations of N5 (including dimers and single atom). It was\n\nobserved that all the configurations lead to the formation of pentagon structure which may\nbe due to confined environment of C60 .\nFor n \u2265 6, different combinations of N, N2 , N3 and higher polynitrogens were considered\nas separate substitutional identities in C60 . We found interesting pattern in the arrangement of nitrogen atoms in polynitrogen compounds, which are very stable and are placed\nsymmetrically across the center. The other observed isomeric structures, though stable, are\nfound distinctly less stable by an energy difference of \u223c 0.5-2.0 eV. The minimum energy\nconfiguration structure of N6 comes out to be a boat-shaped cyclic ring with bond lengths\nof the order of 0.128-0.135 nm and bond angles 108.8o and 122.5 o . In free state N6 is found\nto be stable in hexaazadewarbenzene structure with C2v symmetry which is also one of the\nstable isomers in confinement [75].\nN7 is found to exist as an assembly of a pentagon with bond lengths 0.128-0.132 nm\nand a dimer having bond length 0.111 nm as two separate units. The presence of N5 as an\nindependent identity is responsible for lowering the energy of N7 @C60 indicating its extra\n6\n\n\fstability . However, one closed structure involving N5 and N2 do exist as a close energy\nisomer as shown in Figure1. N8 is found to exist in two planar rings having distinct bond\nlengths of 0.127, 0.138, 0.145 and 0.138 nm which are connected together with a weak N-N\nbond of 0.157 nm. N9 exhibits a stable structure with N5 and N4 planar rings connected\ntogether with a bond of 0.148 nm. The bond lengths for both the rings are in the range\n0.127-0.150 nm. N10 forms a structure with two planar symmetrical pentagon rings on either\nside of center of C60 (D5h symmetry) connected to each other with a single bond of 0.150\nnm. N11 polynitrogen compound is also stable in ring structure with one planar pentagon\nand one non-planar hexagon connected by a bond distances 0.142 and 0.145 nm respectively.\nN12 stabilizes itself symmetrically into two non-planar boat shaped hexagons connected by\nN-N bond of 0.139 nm.\nFor n>12, the polynitrogen compounds do not show any symmetry in distribution of\nnitrogen atoms due to the availability of less space. They make complex yet stable structures.\nN13 is found to exhibit a geometry with one planar pentagon connected to a non-planar closed\nN8 ring with significant distortion on C60 cage. N14 and N15 compounds make distorted\nendohedral complex with nitrogen undergoing chemisorption at the surface breaking the\nsurface C-C and C=C bonds and making C-N bond of 0.136 nm. This leads to the formation\nof heptagon in the cage which results in very large distortion and the maximum and minimum\ndiameter is observed to be 0.760 nm and 0.730 nm respectively. At n=16, the chemisorption\nof three nitrogen atoms results in the opening of the C60 cage.\nThe encapsulation energy is defined as\n\u2206E = E[Nn @C60 ] \u2212 E[C60 ] \u2212 E[Nn ],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E[Nn @C60 ] is the energy of the complex, E[C60 ] is the energy of an isolated C60 and\nE[Nn ] is the energy of an isolated Nn cluster. These energies have been calculated for all\nthe structures and are tabulated in Table I. We would like to add here that the energy of\nNn cluster in isolation is different from the Nn in confinement as their structures are very\ndifferent. These constrained polynitrogen molecules disintegrate into smaller clusters when\nrelaxed in isolation. The encapsulation energy of N2 @C60 is found to be 13.8 kcal/mol,\nwhich is in agreement with the value of 9.11 kcal/mol reported using B3LYP [58]. However\nwe would like to mention here that B3LYP does not describe the non bonding systems\naccurately [59].\n7\n\n\fThe encapsulated polynitrogen clusters results in distortion of icosahedral symmetry of\nthe C60 thereby altering the electronic properties of Nn @C60 significantly. The HOMOLUMO gap variation as a function of number of nitrogen atoms shows gradual decrease\nwith higher values for n= 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. To visualize this we have plotted the Kohn Sham\nenergy levels for Nn @C60 complexes using DZP basis in Figure 4. Also electronic density\nof states (DOS) for the structures are shown in Figure 5-6. We carried out spin polarized\ncalculations on all the optimized geometries. Multiplicities defined as (2s+1), where s is the\nspin of the system, are calculated from the difference of spin up and spin down electrons (Q\nup down) and are tabulated in Table II.\nFor N@C60 we found a spin quartet state when the N atom is placed at the center of\nthe C60 cage i.e N atom retains its atomic nature, which is consistent with the experimental\nESR or EPR spectra of N@C60 [47, 53, 54]. However when the N atom moves toward the\nsurface and makes a covalent bond with the cage, it shows a spin doublet state consistent\nwith experimental results [73]. All the structures with even number of nitrogen atoms show\nspin doublet states (s=1/2) whereas when odd number of nitrogen atoms are present they\nshow spin singlet (s=0) state except for n=13 which shows a spin quartet state (s=3/2).\nThe net charge on the polynitrogen compounds and the fullerene cage atoms are investigated by Mulliken charge analysis. We would like to mention here that charge transfers in\nSIESTA are dependent on the choice of basis set. Therefore, we carried out test calculations\nusing SZ (single zeta), DZ (double zeta) and DZP (double zeta with polarization) (with\nenergy shift ranging from 50 meV -250 meV) basis sets on N@C60 . It was observed that\nusing SZ basis N shows a small charge loss of 0.04 electrons to C60 cage, whereas using DZ\nand DZP basis N shows a small charge gain from the cage. The magnitude of charge transfer\nis found to be higher when DZ is used compared to that using DZP. Within DZP basis set\nas we increase the energy shift the mulliken charge on N tends to increase marginally from\n0.027 (energy shift 50 meV) to 0.040(250 meV). Our work on azafullerenes using DZP basis\nset produced reliable charge transfers in C60\u2212n Nn [76] and it reproduced the experimental\nparameters of C60 and N2 very accurately.\nFor N@C60 , the small charge transfer of 0.04 electrons from the cage to N at center is\nfound to be consistent with spin quartet state as obtained using spin polarized calculations.\nHowever, there are conflicting claims regarding charge transfers in N@C60 using various ab\ninitio calculations. Kobayashi et al. [77] using 6-31G(d) basis set and B3LYP functional has\n8\n\n\freported slightly large spin density at N in N@C60 than in N@C70 consistent with observed\nhyperfine coupling constants. Lu et al. [78] using user defined basis set (considering 2s and\n2p for C and N) and carrying discrete variational local density functional calculations had\nreported charge transfer of 0.11 from C60 cage to N atom at the center. Further, Mauser et\nal. [73] using semi empirical and DFT(B3LYP) and Greer [79] using TZVP spin-unrestricted\nDFT optimized geometry within DZP basis sets have predicted no charge transfers between\nN and C60 . For n=2-10, we found charge transfer from cage to Nn , which may be explained\non the basis of higher values of electronegativity and ionization potential of N than C atoms.\nThe Mulliken charge calculation suggests electron charge transfer ranging between 0.05 to\n0.31 from carbon atoms to the polynitrogen compounds inside up to n=10 except for N2\nwhich shows inverse nature. For n>10, charge transfer of 0.05-0.47 electrons takes place\nfrom nitrogen to carbon atoms of fullerene. This reversal can be attributed to availability\nof less space and overlapping of orbitals which may be further responsible for destabilizing\nthe polynitrogen compounds beyond n=13. As per our information, there are no references\nfor comparison to any theoretical work on polynitrogen clusters in C60 till date.\nFrom the structural analysis of all the Nn @C60 structures and their isomers it may be\nconcluded that N atoms have preferential sites for its stabilization inside fullerenes. Moreover, due to confinement the nitrogen atoms are forced to form lower order bonds. We found\nthat the threshold size of polynitrogen compounds to exist inside as stable molecule is N13 .\nAny further addition of nitrogen inside leads to the formation of C-N bond and heptagon\ninvolving nitrogen atom on the surface. All the nitrogen clusters in Nn @C60 for n>4 has\n70-80 % single bond character which confirms the polymeric nature of nitrogen compounds\nas shown in Figure 7. The structural distortion expressed in terms of elongation defined as\n\u01eb = ( RR0 \u2212 1) where R and R0 are the average radii of expanded and pure C60 is shown in\nFigure 8. The percentage elongation shows a linear increase with the number of nitrogen\natoms up to N15 except for N2 which shows small contraction in C60 cage. The maximum\nthreshold elongation is found to be \u223c 6% for N15 . Indeed, this elongation leads to estimation of extra pressure. Successive addition of nitrogen atoms exert this extra pressure from\nwithin when their number is increased beyond 2, till the stability limit of C60 is reached.\nFurther, the stability of each structure is verified by displacing the nitrogen atoms up to\n0.5 nm and observing the result. We find that after relaxing the structure , it regains its\noptimized form. Moreover, harmonic vibrational frequency analysis is carried out on all the\n9\n\n\fground state structures and the absence of any imaginary frequency value further verifies\nthe true energy minima. The ground state geometries for polynitrogen Nn compounds,\nwhen relaxed in free space, leads to fragmentation with large number of N2 molecule units.\nThis suggests that the polynitrogen compounds are forced to remain stable inside due to\nconfinement and any mechanism triggering the breaking of C60 cage may lead to the release\nof enormous amount of energy. The energy released can be approximately estimated based\non the energy of Nn C60 and C60 and equivalent ( 21 n of N2 molecules). Assuming all n atoms\nof N in Nn C60 clusters are singly bonded (with energy 158.9 kJ/mole), the energy released\non formation of N2 molecules comes out to be around 3-6 kcal/gm of nitrogen atoms. This\nis several times larger than the energy release in the case of TNT.\nWe performed constant-temperature constant-volume molecular dynamics for Nn @C60\nat a temperature of 300K with time period 10 ps with interval of 1 fs. It was observed\nthat for n \u226412 the polynitrogen structures remain intact and do not show any significant\ndeviation from their structures at 0K which demonstrates the stability of polymeric nitrogen\nstructures. But for n \u226513, the C60 cage opens up due to formation of C-N bonds as a result\nof thermal vibrations. Interestingly, our preliminary calculations on addition of few water\nmolecules in Nn @C60 for n=8-10, indicates that the polynitrogen dissociates resulting in\nbreaking of C60 cage.\nThe experimental synthesis of these novel hybrid systems would be a challenging task.\nOwing to the instability of Nn clusters in free space, the most feasible and promising way\nis to trap them in some nanostructures such as fullerenes, nanotubes and transition metal\ncomplexes. It appears to us that Nn @C60 could be synthesized by nitrogen enrichment using\nprolonged ion implantation of N ions or pressure heating [57]. It is well known that laser\nablation of graphite can produce copious amounts of C60 . When graphite, intercalated with\ndesired specie of atom/ molecule is laser ablated, endohedral C60 results. Therefore, even if\nshort-lived Nn clusters could be intercalated before laser ablation, there is good possibility\nof their getting trapped inside C60 cage.\n\n4.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe polynitrogen compounds formed inside C60 are found to be quite stable in confinement. The energy difference of the optimized ground state geometries to the isomeric states\n10\n\n\fis found to be significant, thereby indicating clear choice of ground state structures. The\nspin states of Nn @C60 are found to be quartet for n=1 and n=13, doublet for other odd\nn and singlet for even n. The reversal of polarization and the space available inside C60\nmay be responsible for determining the amount of nitrogen encapsulation inside fullerene.\nThe maximum number of nitrogen atoms that can be encapsulated inside C60 is 13, which\ncan form stable structure at 0K. The endohedral molecules Nn @C60 for n \u2264 12, are found\nto retain their structure at room temperature. This suggests the strong possibility of\nsynthesizing polynitrogen compounds in confinement which could be triggered with suitable\ncombinations of oxygen and hydrogen for extracting tremendous amount of energy. The\namount of energy density from conversion of lower order bonds to triple bonds comes out\nto be about three times in contrast to the conventional chemical energetic materials.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nAuthors are thankful to SIESTA group for providing their computational code and greatly\nacknowledge the computational support provided by Prof.\n\nD.

Geometries of Nn@C60 (a) N8 exist as two planar rings of N4 placed symmetrically and\nconnected by weak N-N bond (1.57 \u00c5) (b) N9 exist as two planar rings of N4 and N5 connected by weak\nN-N bond (1.48 \u00c5) (c) N10 exists as two planar and slightly inclined pentagon rings connected by weak\nN-N bond (1.50 \u00c5) (d) N11 exist as interconnected structure of planar N5 and non-planar N6 placed\nacross centre (e) N12 exist as symmetrically placed two boat shaped hexagons connected by N-N bond\ndistance of 1.39 \u00c5 (f) N13 exists as interconnected structure of planar N5 and a heavily distorted N8\nhowever, the less interstitial space inside C60 forces the nitrogen atoms to make bonds with surface\ncarbon atoms. The above structures of polynitrogen molecules in C60 show nearly 70-80% single bond\ncharacter.\n\n20\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure3 (a) N14@C60 exits as a distorted complex with N12 existing as interconnected structure of N5 and\nN7. Two nitrogen atoms undergo chemisorption resulting in 62 atom cage with the formation of two\nheptagons on surface. (b) N15@C60 doesn't show any pattern in structure of polynitrogen molecule.\nHexagons and pentagons of C60 show heavily distortion with C-C bond distances increasing up to 1.651.67\u00c5 which is the breaking point for C60 cage. (c) N16@C60 exists as a polymeric complex with three\nnitrogen atoms getting substituted at the surface and making a heptagon and octagon which henceforth\nleads to the opening of the cage indicating the threshold limit for nitrogen encapsulation at 0K.\nIn above structures, due to less available space nitrogen tends to make bonds with the surface atoms as\nwell as undergoing chemisorption. These structures are unstable at room temperature.\n\n21\n\n\f5.0\n2.5\n\nLUMO\n\nLUMO HOMO\nHOMO\n\n0.0\n\nLUMO\n\n-2.5\n\nLUMO\n\nLUMO\n\nHOMO\n\nHOMO\n\n-5.0\n\nLUMO\nHOMO\n\n-7.5\n\nHOMO\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n-10.0\n-12.5\n-15.0\n-17.5\n-20.0\n-22.5\n-25.0\n-27.5\n-30.0\n-32.5\n-35.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 11 12 13 14 15\n\nN n cluster\nFigure 4.
