The magnitude\nof the spin current is determined by the ratio of longitudinal and transverse\nexchange interactions Jk /J\u22a5 and by the magnetic field. For large magnetic\nfields the Zeeman energy strongly renormalizes the Ising term giving rise to\na maximum spin current. In the limit of Jk /J\u22a5 \u226a 1 the amplitude of the\ncurrent behaves like 1 \u2212 (Jk /J\u22a5 )2 .

The basic idea of persistent currents was put\nforward a few decades ago [1\u20133]. The effect of a magnetic flux threading a metallic ring, such\nthat the magnetic field at the ring vanishes, can be replaced by a twist of the wavefunction\nboundary conditions. The change in these boundary conditions gives rise to an asymmetry\nbetween the number of electrons with K > KF and K < \u2212KF , where KF denotes Fermi\nmomentum. As a result, an electric current is induced in mesoscopic ring structures. For\nlarge ring structures, in the thermodynamic limit, the current vanishes; in agreement with\nthe fact that no spontaneous broken chirality occurs in non-interacting systems. A new\ninterest in this problem has arisen for non-Fermi liquids. In particular, for Luttinger liquids\nnovel behavior has recently been proposed [4\u20137].\nIn the last ten years the \"parallel transport\" idea introduced by Berry [8] for adiabatic\nprocesses has provided new insight into currents induced by topological effects. A typical\nsituation considered by Berry was a spin-1/2 electron in a time periodic magnetic field.\nAssuming adiabatic motion Berry showed that when an electron returns to its initial position\nthe wavefunction accumulates a nontrivial phase equal to the angle of rotation of the spin-1/2\nangular momentum on a sphere. This is the Berry phase [8\u201310].\nRecently it has been shown [11] that for an integer spin S = 1 ferromagnet the Berry\nphase combined with the spin-orbit effect can give rise to a spin current and a corresponding\nelectric field. Here we propose a new way of generating a spin current, when a spatially\nperiodic magnetic field acts on a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic ring a Berry phase in space is\ninduced giving rise to a twist on the wavefunction boundary condition. As a consequence a\npersistent spin current is induced. This result can be understood within the Berry parallel\ntransport idea since a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet is Lorentz invariant.\nWe consider a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ring of circumference L in the\npresence of a spatially-dependent magnetic field of the \"crown shape\" form, ~h(x) =\nh0 (sin \u03b8(x) cos \u03c6(x), sin \u03b8(x) sin \u03c6(x), cos \u03b8(x)), where \u03b8(x) and \u03c6(x) are polar \u2212\u03c0 \u2264 \u03c6(x) \u2264\n\u03c0, and azimuthal 0 < \u03b8(x) \u2264 \u03b80 < \u03c0/2 angles such that \u03c6(x) = \u03c6(x + L), see Fig. 1. We\n2\n\n\frestrict \u03b8(x) to the \"northern\" hemisphere which obeys \u03b8(x) = \u03b8(x + L). The Hamiltonian\nfor the spin-1/2 antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field is:\nH=\n\nX\nX\nJ \u0303\u22a5 X\n~h(x)*S(x),\n~\n(S+ (x)S\u2212 (x+1)+S\u2212 (x+1)S+ (x))+J \u0303k\nS3 (x)S3 (x+1)+g\u03bcB\n(1)\n2 x\nx\nx\n\nwhere J \u0303\u22a5 and J \u0303k are the transverse and longitudinal exchange coupling constants.\n~\nWe rotate S(x)\nin the direction of the magnetic field ~h(x) using the following unitary\ntransformation:\n!\n\n!\n\n\u03b8(x)\n\u03c6(x)\nN \u22121\n\u03c33 exp \u2212i\n\u03c32 ,\n\u00db = \u03a0x=0\nexp \u2212i\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the circumference of the ring is L = Na and \u03c32 and \u03c33 are Pauli spin-1/2 matrices.\nAs a result of the unitary transformation Eq. (2), the Hamiltonian H is transformed to\nH\u0303 = \u00db \u2020 H \u00db. Due to the periodicity of the angles \u03b8(x) and \u03c6(x) the transformed wavefunction\nobeys the same boundary condition as the original wavefunction.\nThe transformed Hamiltonian H\u0303 takes the form,\nH\u0303 \u2243\n\n\u22121 \u0010\n\u0011\nJ\u22a5 NX\nS+ (x)eiA(x,x+1) S\u2212 (x + 1) + S\u2212 (x)e\u2212iA(x,x+1) S+ (x + 1)\n2 x=0\n\n+Jk\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nS3 (x)S3 (x + 1) + g\u03bcB h0\n\nX\n\nS3 (x).\n\n(3)\n\nx\n\nx=0\n\nIn Eq. (3) A(x, x + 1) is the Berry connection:\n1\nd\u03c6\nA(x, x + 1) \u2261 A\u03c6 d\u03c6 = (1 + cos \u03b8(x)) dx.\n2\ndx\n\n(4)\n\nTo obtain Eq. (4) we have restricted \u03b8(x) to the range 0 < \u03b8(x) < \u03b80 \u2264 \u03c0/4, where \u03b80\ndenotes the maximum tilt angle of the \"crown-shaped\" magnetic field (Fig. 1). The Berry\nconnection results from rotating the coordinate of the spin-1/2 operator. Moving around\nthe ring, a phase proportional to the subtended solid angle accumulates.\nDue to the unitary transformation the exchange couplings J \u0303\u22a5 , J \u0303k are replaced by\nJ\u22a5 and Jk , where Jk \u2261 J \u0303k hcos2 \u03b8(x)i, J\u22a5 \u2261 J \u0303\u22a5 ((1 + hcos2 \u03b8(x)i)/2) with hcos2 \u03b8(x)i \u2261\n(1/\u03b80 )\n\nR \u03b80\n0\n\ncos2 \u03b8d\u03b8 = (1/2)(1 + (sin 2\u03b80 /2\u03b80 )).\n\n3\n\n\f~\nFollowing Ref. [12] we use a Jordan-Wigner transformation to replace the spin-1/2 S(x)\noperator by the spinless fermions c\u2020 , c(x):\nS\u2212 (x) = e\u2212i\u03c0\n\nPN\u22121\nx=0\n\nn(x)\n\nc(x), S+ (x) = [S\u2212 (x)]\u2020 , S3 (x) = c\u2020 (x)c(x)\u22121/2, n(x) = c\u2020 (x)c(x).\n(5)\n\nIt is convenient to replace the fermion c(x) by d(x), c(x) = ei\u0393(x) d(x), c\u2020 (x) = d\u2020 (x)e\u2212i\u0393(x) .\nIn addition, we choose A(x, x+1)+\u03c0(n(x)\u22121) = \u0393(x)\u2212\u0393(x+1). As a result the Hamiltonian\nin Eq.

(8b)\n\u2212\n\u2202\u03b8\n\nHere, \u03a9(\u03b80 ) measures the twist on the boundary conditions. Consequently, the equation for\nd(x) is replaced by\nd(x + L) = \u2212ei\u03c0(\u03a9(\u03b80 )/\u03c0\u22121) d(x)ei\u03c0N = \u2212ei\u03c0(\u03b4\u22121) d(x),\n\n(8c)\n\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03a9(\u03b80 )/\u03c0 + \u2206N , \u2206N = 0 if N is even and \u2206N = 1 if N is odd. Equation (8c)\nexpresses the twist of the boundary condition. Consequently, the \"twist\" of the boundary\n4\n\n\fcondition is equal to the solid angle \u03a9(\u03b80 ), see Fig. 1. Equations (8b) and (8c) represent\none of our major results: a geometrical rotation of the spin-1/2 coordinate gives rise to a\nBerry phase which changes the boundary conditions for the wavefunction.\nWe construct the continuum representation of the Hamiltonian H\u0303.

Using the unitary\ntransformation given in Eq. (13) and the Bosonic representation in Eq.

(16). The Heisenberg\nequation of motion for the zero modes introduced in Ref. [13] allows us to construct the\nspin current operator. We replace the electric charge by the magnetic charge s = g\u03bcB . As\na result the spin current is given by the time derivative of the zero mode coordinate:\nIM\n\ns\nsvs\ns d\u03b1\n= [\u03b1, \u0124] =\n(N\u0302L \u2212 N\u0302R ),\n=\n2\u03c0 dt\nih\nL\n\n!\n\nJk\nJ\u22a5 a\n1\u2212\n.\nvs \u2261\nh\u0304\n\u03c0J\u22a5\n\n(18)\n\nFrom Eq. (18) we see that the spin current is determined by the spin liquid velocity vs =\nJ\u22a5 a/h\u0304 and the expectation value of the current operator J\u02c6 = N\u0302L \u2212 N\u0302R \u2261 \u2212i2d/d\u03b1.\nTo calculate the spin current we find the ground state wavefunction given by the eigenstate of the zero mode Hamiltonian. The zero mode Hamiltonian is obtained as a result of\nprojecting out the non-zero mode field \u03b8\u0302(x). This projection is obtained with the help of\nthe Renormalization Group (R.G.) equations given in Ref. [14]. We consider the mesoscopic\nregion, namely that the thermal length LT = h\u0304vs /kB T is larger than the circumference L\nof the ring. L defines the ring temperature T ring = h\u0304vs /kB L. The backward coupling is\nrenormalized and replaced by \u03bbef f . At a scale b we have: \u03bb\u0302(b) \u223c \u03bb\u0302b\u2212x where 1 < b < L/a\nand x = 2(2K \u2212 1). For J\u22a5 > Jk , x > 0 and \u03bb(b) decreases. For J\u22a5 \u223c Jk we have x \u2243 0 and\n\u03bb\u0302(b) \u2243 \u03bb\u0302/(1 + \u03bb\u0302ln(b)) decreases much more slowly.\n7\n\n\fWhen Jk > J\u22a5 , \u03bb\u0302(b) grows with b at the scale b\u2217 \u2243 e1/\u03bb\u0302(0) . When \u03bb\u0302(b) diverges, it signals\nthat a spin gap is opened. Thus for a finite ring, gapless excitations are possible in the\nregime \u03c0J\u22a5 > Jk > J\u22a5 if the length of the ring L is shorter than exp(1/\u03bb\u0302), L < a exp(1/\u03bb\u0302),\nand the thermal length LT obeys LT > exp(1/\u03bb\u0302) > L.\nOnce the particle hole boson \u03b8\u0302(x) has been integrated away, one obtains a zero mode\nHamiltonian. The zero mode eigenfunctions \u03c8n,m (\u03b1, \u03b2) of the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (16)\nhave the form:\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03c8n,m (\u03b1, \u03b2) = Aei(\u03b4\u22121)\u03b1/2 ei(q\u2212[q])\u03b2/2 ein\u03b1/2 eim\u03b2/2 \uf8f01 +\n\nX\n\nr=\u00b12,\u00b14,...\n\n\uf8f9\n\nCr eir\u03b1/2 \uf8fb .\n\n(19)\n\nFor simplicity we consider the case that q is an integer, q \u2212 [q] = 0. Under this condition\nthe wavefunction in Eq. (19) is characterized by n = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ... and m = 0.\nThe effective zero mode Hamiltonian for Q = 0 has the form:\n\u0124ef f =\n\nh\u0304\u03c0vs \u02c62\nJ + \u03bbef f cos(2\u03b1 + 2\u03c0q),\n2L\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03bbef f = (Jk /2\u03c0)F (L/a)[sin(2\u03c0q)/(2\u03c0q)]. Here F (L/a) is the scaling function\nF (L/a) = (L/a)\u2212x ,\n\nx > 0 and F (L/a) = (1 + \u03bb\u0302ln(L/a))\u22121 ,\n\nx \u223c 0.\n\nHere, q measures the ratio of the Zeeman energy and the spin liquid lowest energy state\nexcitation in the ring. When q \u226a 1 (h0 \u2192 0) the last term in Eq. (20) is replaced by\ncos 2\u03b1. For large magnetic fields, q \u2243 0.5 the cosine term can be ignored and the spin\ncurrent is given by IM \u2243 \u2212g\u03bcB (vs /L)(1 \u2212 \u03a9(\u03b80 )/\u03c0). Using typical values of exchange energy\nJ \u223c 100K \u2212 1000K and magnetic fields of 5 \u2212 10 Tesla one finds q \u223c 1 justifying the neglect\nof the Ising term. In the remaining discussion we consider the modification of the current\ncaused by the term \u03bbef f cos(2\u03b1 + 2\u03c0q).\nUsing Bloch theory we compute the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (20). We\n\u221a\nfind \u03c8n,l (\u03b1) = (1/ 4\u03c0) exp(i(\u03b4 \u22121)\u03b1/2) exp(in\u03b1/2)Un,l (\u03b1); n = 0, 1, 2, 3 are the Bloch states\nin the reduced zone and l is the energy band index. We restrict the discussion to the sector\nQ = 0. Therefore the possible states for J are n = 0, 2. Odd states are excluded since\n8\n\n\fthey give states with Q 6= 0. Using Bloch states \u03c8n,l (\u03b1) \u2261 h\u03b1|n, l) with eigenvalues En,l , we\ncompute the spin current formula using Eq. (18) and find\nIM\n\n2 X\n2 X\nX\nvs X\n1\n1\n\u02c6 l)e\u2212En,l /kB T = \u22122g\u03bcB\n= \u2212g\u03bcB\n(n, l|J|n,\nL n=0 l Z\nn=0 l Z\n\nHere Z is the zero mode partition function Z =\n\nP2\n\nn=0\n\nP\n\nl\n\n!\n\n\u2202En,l \u2212En,l /kB T\ne\n. (21)\n\u2202n\n\ne\u2212En,l /kB T and |n, l) are Bloch states\n\nwith the eigenvalues En,l . The second part of Eq. (21) was obtained from Bloch's theory,\nsee Ref. [15]. Using Eq. (21) we calculate the current for two cases: (a) weak coupling,\n\u03bbef f /(h\u0304\u03c0vs /2L) \u226a 1, and (b) strong coupling \u03bbef f /(h\u0304\u03c0vs /2L) \u226b 1.\n(a) The weak coupling case: Because \u03bbef f decreases as L\u2212x , x < 1 and the kinetic term\n(the term proportional to J\u02c62 ) decreases as 1/L, the weak coupling region is achieved only\nfor J\u22a5 \u226b Jk or large magnetic fields | sin 2\u03c0q/2\u03c0q| \u226a 1. For this case we can use first\norder perturbation theory [16] to find the ground state Bloch wavefunction \u03c8n=0 (\u03b1) for the\nHamiltonian in Eq.

Equation (23) is valid for values of Jk /J\u22a5\nsatisfying (Jk /J\u22a5 )| sin 2\u03c0q/2\u03c0q| < (a/L)1\u2212x .\n(b) The strong coupling case: For this case we compute the eigenfunctions of Eq.\n(20) using the \"instanton\" method given in Ref.\n\n[17] or the solution given on page\n\n231 in Ref. [15]. For large \u03bbef f the eigenvalues En,l=\u00b1 are given by En,\u00b1 = (h\u0304\u03c9/2) \u00b1\n\u221a\n(h\u0304\u03c9 D/\u03c0) cos[2\u03c0n + 2\u03c0(\u03b4 \u2212 1)], where the energy scale h\u0304\u03c9 is determined by h\u0304\u03c9 \u2261\n\u221a\n(h\u0304vs(0) /L)[(1/2\u03c0)(Jk /J\u22a5 )(L/a)1\u2212x | sin 2\u03c0q/2\u03c0q|] with vs(0) = J\u22a5 a/h\u0304 and the band width D\n\u221a\nR q\nis given by D \u2261 [exp \u2212\u03c9 02\u03c0 2 cos(\u03b1 + 2\u03c0q)d\u03b1]. Using the spin current given by Eq. (21)\nwe find,\n\nIM = \u2212g\u03bcB\n\n\u221a q\nvs(0)\nsin[2\u03c0(1 \u2212 \u03a9(\u03b80 )/\u03c0] D (8/\u03c0)(Jk/J\u22a5 )|sin(2\u03c0q)/2\u03c0q|(L/a)1\u2212x .\nL\n9\n\n(24)\n\n\fFrom Eq. (24) we see that when Jk /J\u22a5 increases the current is suppressed since the band\nq\n\u221a\nwidth D scales like exp(\u2212 Jk /J\u22a5 ). The results in Eq. (23) and (24) are a consequence\nof the twist of the boundary condition obtained in Eq. (8c). In both cases the current\n\nwas obtained for the even case, namely \u2206N = 0. For the odd case \u2206N = 1 and instead of\n1 \u2212 \u03a9(\u03b80 )/\u03c0 we have \u03a9(\u03b80 )/\u03c0.\nWhether it is possible to detect the spin liquid current is an important question. Because\nof the Aharanov-Casher effect, when a metallic rod is inserted at the center of the ring one\n(0)\n\nexpects to find an electrostatic potential \u03a6E (0) \u2243 (IM /L)(2\u03c0)2 , i.e., a voltage proportional\n(0)\n\nto the spin current IM . For a magnetic field h0 \u2243 10 Tesla, an exchange energy J\u22a5 \u223c 2000\nKelvin and a ring of 10 \u03bcm, the Zeeman/exchange energy ratio is of the order of 10 allowing\n(0)\n\nus to neglect the Ising term Jk and obtain a maximal current IM . For a ring of 10 \u03bcm\nwe need to have a low temperature such that LT = h\u0304vs /kB T > 10 \u03bcm; corresponding to a\ntemperature of one Kelvin.\nMaterials that can be used to fabricate antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ring structures include\ncopper-benzoate. It is possible to fabricate such rings using plasma etching techniques in\nwhich a mesoscopic ring structure is etched out on a substrate and the desired magnetic\nmaterial is deposited creating a magnetic ring structure. The persistent spin current can be\nmeasured using a scanning capacitance probe. Due to spin-orbit coupling the current will\ngenerate an electric field and therefore a potential difference. A small current in the ring\nwill generate a voltage of the order of a nano-volt. An alternative approach is to attach\ntwo leads to a Luttinger liquid ring in the Aharonov-Bohm geometry with a crown shaped\nmagnetic field. This generates a phase both in spin and charge. If the ring in the center\nis threaded with a flux tube [18] that exactly cancels the magnetic flux due to the crown\nshaped field, the remaining contribution is due to spin. Note that this flux tube will not\naffect the magnetic field on the ring.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a crown shaped magnetic field when acting on a spin1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain can give rise to a spin current proportional to the\nsolid angle \u03a9(\u03b80 ) = \u03c0(1 \u2212 cos \u03b80 ). The amplitude of the current is controlled by the ratio\n10\n\n\fJk /J\u22a5 and the Zeeman energy. A possible experimental realization has been suggested.\nAcknowledgement: D.S. was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy grant number FG02-01ER45909.
