In particular, the influence of\ncontrolled hydrostatic pressure on structural, thermodynamic, and electronic properties of various kinds of solids\nhas been deeply studied. Pressures on the order of tens\nof GPa can now be routinely applied to real materials\n[2, 3, 4, 5].\nSolid helium, in spite of having been studied for many\nyears, has a broad interest in condensed matter physics\nbecause of its peculiar character of \"quantum solid\". In\nparticular, its zero-point vibrational energy and associated anharmonic effects are markedly larger than in most\nknown solids [6]. In addition, its electronic simplicity allows one to carry out detailed studies, that would be\nenormously difficult for other materials [7, 8, 9]. The interest on the behavior of solids under high pressures has\nbeen also focused on solid helium. Thus, diamond-anvilcell and shock-wave experiments have allowed to study\nthe equation of state (EOS) of solid 4 He up to pressures\non the order of 50 GPa [2, 10, 11]. In last years, the\neffect of pressure on heavier rare-gas solids has also been\nof interest for both experimentalists [4, 12] and theorists\n[13, 14, 15, 16].\nThe Feynman path-integral formulation of statistical\nmechanics [17, 18] is well suited to study thermodynamic\nproperties of solids at temperatures lower than their Debye temperature \u0398D , where the quantum character of\nthe atomic nuclei becomes important. In particular, the\ncombination of path integrals with computer simulation\nmethods, such as Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics,\nhas revealed as a powerful technique to carry out quantitative and nonperturbative studies of many-body quantum systems at finite temperatures. This has allowed to\nstudy several properties of solids further than the usual\nharmonic or quasiharmonic approximations [7].\n\nThe path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method has\nbeen used to study several properties of solid helium\n[7, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], as well as heavier rare-gas\nsolids [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. For helium, in particular, this method has predicted kinetic-energy values [19]\nand Debye-Waller factors [31] in good agreement with\ndata derived from experiments [32, 33]. PIMC simulations have been also employed to study the isotopic shift\nin the helium melting curve [20, 21]. The EOS of solid\nhelium at T = 0 has been studied by diffusion Monte\nCarlo in a wide density range [9, 34], as well as at finite\ntemperatures by using PIMC simulations with several interatomic potentials [22].\nIn last years, there has been a debate on the existence\nof supersolidity in 4 He at temperatures lower than 1 K\n[35, 36, 37, 38]. This debate is still open, but is out of the\nscope of this paper, since we consider here solid helium at\ntemperatures higher than 10 K, where quantum exchange\neffects between atomic nuclei are not relevant.\nIn this paper, we study the compressibility of solid\n3\nHe and 4 He by PIMC simulations. We employ the\nisothermal-isobaric (N P T ) ensemble, which allows us to\nconsider properties of these solids along well-defined isobars. For comparison, we present also results of PIMC\nsimulations in the canonical (N V T ) ensemble. By comparing results for 3 He and 4 He, we analyse isotopic effects\non the compressibility as a function of pressure.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the computational method is described. In Sec. III we present\nand discuss the results, that are given in several subsections dealing with thermodynamic consistency, pressure\nand temperature dependence of the bulk modulus, isotopic effects, and thermal expansion. Finally, in Sec. IV\nwe present the conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nMETHOD\n\nEquilibrium properties of solid 3 He and 4 He in the\nface-centred cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp)\n\n\f2\nphases have been calculated by PIMC simulations. The\nPIMC method relies on an isomorphism between the\nquantum system under consideration and a fictitious classical one, obtained by replacing each quantum particle by\na cyclic chain of Q classical particles (Q: Trotter number), connected by harmonic springs with a temperaturedependent force constant. This isomorphism appears as\na consequence of discretizing the density matrix along\ncyclic paths, which is usual in the path-integral formulation of statistical mechanics [17, 18]. Details on this\ncomputational method are given elsewhere [7, 39, 40, 41].\nHelium atoms were considered as quantum particles interacting through an effective interatomic potential, composed of a two-body and a three-body part. For the twobody interaction, we employed the potential developed\nby Aziz et al. [42] (the so-called HFD-B3-FCI1 potential). For the three-body part we took a Bruch-McGeetype potential [43, 44], with the parameters given by\nLoubeyre [44], but with parameter A in the attractive exchange interaction rescaled by a factor 2/3, as suggested\nin Ref. [21]. This interatomic potential was found earlier\nto describe well the vibrational energy and equation-ofstate of solid helium in a broad range of pressures and\ntemperatures [23].\nOur simulations were based on the so-called \"primitive\" form of PIMC [39, 45]. We considered explicitly\ntwo- and three-body terms in the simulations. The actual consideration of three-body terms did not allow us\nto use effective forms for the density matrix, developed\nto simplify the calculation when only two-body terms are\nexplicitly considered [21]. Quantum exchange effects between atomic nuclei were not taken into account, because\nthey are negligible for solid helium at the temperatures\nand pressures studied here. (This is expected to be valid\nassuming the absence of vacancies and for temperatures\nhigher than the exchange frequency \u223c 10\u22126 K [7].) To\ncalculate the energy we have used the \"crude\" estimator,\nas defined in Refs. [39, 45].\nWe have employed both the canonical (N V T ) ensemble and the isothermal-isobaric (N P T ) ensemble. Our\nsimulations were performed on supercells of the fcc and\nhcp unit cells, including 500 and 432 helium atoms respectively. To check the convergence of our results with\nsystem size, we carried out some simulations for other supercell sizes, and found that finite-size effects for N > 400\natoms are negligible for the quantities studied here. In\nparticular, changes of the bulk modulus with the size of\nthe simulation cell were found to be smaller than the\nstatistical error bar of the values derived from our simulations.\nSampling of the configuration space was carried out\nby the Metropolis method at temperatures between 12 K\nand the melting temperature at each considered pressure.\nFor given temperature and pressure, a typical run consisted of 104 Monte Carlo steps for system equilibration,\nfollowed by 4 \u00d7 105 steps for the calculation of ensemble average properties. Each step included attempts to\nmove every replica of every atom in the simulation cell.\n\nIn the N P T simulations, it also included an attempt to\nchange the volume. To keep roughly constant the accuracy of the computed quantities at different temperatures, we took a Trotter number Q proportional to the\ninverse temperature, so that QT = 3000 K. This means\nthat for solid helium at T = 20 K we had Q = 150, and\na PIMC simulation for N = 500 atoms effectively includes 75000 \"classical\" particles. More technical details\nare given in Refs. [23, 29, 46].\nIn the N V T ensemble the pressure and isothermal\nbulk modulus B = \u2212V (\u2202P /\u2202V )T can be obtained from\nthermal averages of various quantities obtained in PIMC\nsimulations, as shown in Appendix A. The derivation\nis straightforward from the partition function ZN V T for\nN quantum particles in the canonical ensemble, but is\nrather tedious in the case of the bulk modulus, due to the\nnumber of terms appearing in the volume derivatives. In\nparticular, B can be obtained from Eqs. (A11) and (A12)\nin Appendix A. In the N P T ensemble, the isothermal\nbulk modulus is related to the mean-square fluctuations\nof the volume V of the simulation cell by the expression:\n\u03c3V2 =\n\nV\nkB T ,\nB\n\n(1)\n\nas shown in Appendix B.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA.\n\nConsistency checks\n\nWe have calculated the bulk modulus in the N P T and\nN V T ensembles. In general, we prefer the isothermalisobaric ensemble, so that we can study solids along\nwell-defined isotherms. N V T simulations are, however,\nfrequently used in PIMC simulations [7, 19, 31], and a\ncomparison of results obtained in both ensembles seems\nnecessary as a consistency check of the method, and in\nparticular for the case of solid helium.\nWe discuss first results obtained in the N P T ensemble. At constant pressure, the relative fluctuations in the\nvolume, \u03c3V /V , can be found from Eq. (1):\n\u03c3V\n=\nV\n\n\u0012\n\nkB T\nBV\n\n\u0013 21\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nFor hcp 4 He at 25 K we found in PIMC simulations\n\u03c3V /V = 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 for P = 2 GPa, and a lower value\nof 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 for 20 GPa (for a simulation cell including\nN = 432 atoms). This means that the product BV increases as the pressure is raised [see Eq. (2], in spite of\nthe reduction of V , indicating that the growth of bulk\nmodulus with the pressure dominates in the product BV\n(see below).\nFor a cubic crystal, the fluctuations in the lattice parameter a can be derived from Eq. (1) to give:\n\u03c3a2 =\n\nkB T\n,\n9L3 aB\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\n5\n\n80\n\nfcc 4He\n\n4\n\nT = 100 K\n\nBulk modulus (GPa)\n\n10 3 \u03c3a / a\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2 GPa\n2\n\n7 GPa\n\n1\n\n0\n\n60\n\nHe\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n-3/2\n\nwhere L3 is the number of cubic unit cells in a simulation\ncell with side length La. From Eq. (3) one can see that\nthe relative fluctuation in the lattice parameter, \u03c3a /a,\nscales as L\u22123/2 . This normalized fluctuation for fcc 4 He\nis displayed in Fig. 1 as a function of L\u22123/2 . Shown are\nresults of PIMC simulations in the N P T ensemble at T\n= 100 K and two pressures: 2 and 7 GPa. The linear\ndependence shown in this figure agrees with the dependence of \u03c3a on the simulation-cell size given by Eq. (3).\nThe different slopes of these lines are basically due to the\nchange of compressibility with pressure.\nTo check the thermodynamic consistency of our simulations in both N P T and N V T ensembles we have carried out several tests. The first obvious test consists\nin taking the crystal volume derived from isothermalisobaric simulations, and using it as an input in N V T\nsimulations at the same temperature. The latter should\ngive the same pressure [using Eq. (A7)] as that used earlier in the N P T simulations. As an example, for fcc\n4\nHe at 25 K and 1 GPa, we find first a lattice parameter a = 3.6955 \u00c5, that introduced as an input in N V T\nsimulations yields a pressure of 1.0002(5) GPa, in good\nagreement with the input in the previous N P T simulations. Going on with the same set of parameters, we can\nalso check the consistency of the bulk modulus B derived\nfrom both types of simulations. At constant pressure (P\n= 1 GPa), we find BN P T = 4.50(2) GPa from the volume fluctuations [see Eq. (B5) in Appendix B] vs BN V T\n= 4.47(2) GPa derived at constant volume by using expressions (A11) and (A12).\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nPressure (GPa)\n\nL\n\nFIG. 1: Relative fluctuation of the lattice parameter, \u03c3a /a,\nof fcc 4 He vs L\u22123/2 , for simulation cells of lateral size La.\nShown are results of PIMC simulations for two pressures (2\nand 7 GPa) at T = 100 K, and for L = 3, 4, 5, and 7. Error\nbars are less than the symbol size.\n\n5\n\nFIG. 2: Isothermal bulk modulus of solid 4 He as a function\nof pressure at three temperatures: 25 K (squares), 150 K\n(circles), and 300 K (triangles). Open and filled symbols correspond to hcp and fcc helium, respectively. Error bars are\nsmaller than the symbol size. Dashed lines are fits to the data\npoints using the expression: B = B0 + B0\u2032 P + 21 B0\u2032\u2032 P 2 .\n\nB.\n\nPressure and temperature dependence\n\nWe now consider the pressure dependence of the bulk\nmodulus, as derived from our PIMC simulations. This is\nshown in Fig. 2 for 4 He at three temperatures. In this\nfigure, T decreases from top to bottom: T = 25, 150, and\n300 K; open and filled symbols correspond to hcp and fcc\nhelium, respectively. At each considered temperature, we\npresent data for the pressure region where the solid was\nstable (or metastable) along the PIMC simulations, a region that becomes broader as the temperature is lowered.\nIn addition to the typical rise of B for increasing pressure, we find that for a given pressure, B decreases as\nthe temperature is raised. In the pressure range shown\nin Fig. 2 one also observes a departure of linearity in the\ndependence of B on pressure. By fitting these results to\nthe expression B = B0 + B0\u2032 P + 21 B0\u2032\u2032 P 2 , we can find the\npressure derivatives at P = 0 (B0\u2032 and B0\u2032\u2032 ). Thus, for T\n= 25 K we obtain B0 = 0.47 GPa, B0\u2032 = 4.01, and B0\u2032\u2032 =\n\u20130.068 GPa\u22121 .\nFor the other temperatures shown in Fig. 2 (T = 150\nand 300 K), an extrapolation of the results to P = 0\nyields negative values of B0 , indicating that the solid is\nmechanically unstable at these temperatures for low pressures. At 25 K and zero pressure, even though the liquid\nis known to be the stable phase, the solid can still be\nmetastable, as it has not yet reached the limit of mechanical stability, or the spinodal line . Apart from this, the\ncurves B(P ) at the considered temperatures are rather\nparallel one to the other in the common stability region.\nIt is interesting to compare the bulk modulus obtained\n\n\f4\n120\n\nP = 10 GPa\n\nBulk modulus (GPa)\n\nBulk modulus (GPa)\n\n40\n\n30\n\n7 GPa\n20\n\nhcp\n\nfcc\n\nhcp 4 He\n\n100\n\nT = 300 K\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n4 GPa\n10\n\n20\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nTemperature (K)\nFIG. 3: Isothermal bulk modulus of solid 4 He as a function of\ntemperature at three hydrostatic pressures: 4 GPa (squares),\n7 GPa (circles), and 10 GPa (triangles).

Dashed lines are guides to the eye.\n\nhere for solid helium with those of heavier rare-gas solids\nat the same conditions. For example, at T = 20 K and\nP = 1 GPa, we find for solid 4 He: B = 4.53 GPa, vs 7.20\nand 9.43 for Ne and Ar, respectively [30]. This is in line\nwith the known result that the bulk modulus increases\nwith atomic mass for given values of temperature and\npressure [30].\nRare-gas solids have been studied in metastable conditions, even at negative pressures [47]. They have been\nfound to be metastable in PIMC simulations close to the\nspinodal point, defined as the point at which the compressibility \u03ba = 1/B diverges (or the bulk modulus vanishes). Thus, for solid Ne and Ar at 5 K, the spinodal\npoint was found at P = \u221291 and \u2212245 MPa. For solid\nhelium, we could not approach the spinodal point at any\ntemperature, due to the large quantum fluctuations that\nmake the solid to be unstable along the simulations. This\nhappened even at zero pressure and relatively low temperature, in spite of the fact that the expected bulk modulus at these conditions is still far from vanishing. For\nexample, at 25 K we find for solid helium B0 = 0.47 GPa,\nas derived from extrapolation of the results obtained at\nP > 0.2 GPa (see above and Fig. 2), but the solid was\nunstable in our simulations at P < 0.2 GPa.\nThe temperature dependence of the bulk modulus is\ndisplayed in Fig. 3 for three different pressures.

In fact, the obtained\ncurves B(T ) are parallel within the statistical error of our\nsimulations. In the whole accessible temperature range,\nthe bulk modulus decreases by 2.1, 2.6, and 3.1 GPa, for\nP = 4, 7, and 10 GPa, respectively. These values amount\nto 13.0, 9.8, and 8.5 % of the corresponding bulk modulus\nat 25 K.\nTo connect with data derived from experiment, we note\nthat Zha et al. [48] have obtained the bulk modulus of\nsolid 4 He from Brillouin scattering measurements. From\nthese results, they derived the dependence of the isothermal bulk modulus upon material density at 300 K. In\nFig. 4 we present results of our PIMC simulations for\n4\nHe at 300 K (open squares) along with those derived\nfrom Brillouin scattering experiments at room temperature (solid line). At this temperature, the density region\nbetween 0.95 and 1.25 g cm\u22123 corresponds to a pressure\nbetween 12 and 29 GPa. At \u03c1 < 1 g cm\u22123 , our results\ncoincide within error bars with those derived from Brillouin scattering, and at higher densities the bulk modulus\nderived from PIMC simulations is somewhat larger. For\nexample, at density \u03c1 = 1 and 1.25 g/cm3 , Zha et al. [48]\nobtained B = 42.1 and 79.9 GPa respectively, to be compared with B = 44 and 86 GPa yielded by our PIMC\nsimulations of 4 He at the same densities and T = 300\nK. This means that at \u03c1 = 1.25 g cm\u22123 , the difference\namounts to about 7%.\n\n\f5\n0.5\n\nIsotopic effect\n\nT = 25 K\n\n0.4\n\n\u2206 B (GPa)\n\nAn interesting point in this context is the influence\nof the atomic mass on the solid compressibility. This\nisotopic effect can be readily obtained from PIMC simulations, since the mass is an input parameter in these\ncalculations. Similar isotopic effects have been studied\nearlier for the melting curve [20, 21] and molar volume\n[23, 24] of solid helium. For a given material, lighter isotopes form more compressible solids, as a consequence of\nan increase in the molar volume. This is in fact due to a\ncombination of the anharmonicity in the interatomic potential and zero-point vibrations, which are most important at low temperature. Since these quantum vibrations\nare especially large in the case of helium, due to its low\nmass, the isotopic effect on the bulk modulus is expected\nto be appreciable.\nThus, one expects the bulk modulus of solid 4 He to\nbe larger than that of 3 He. This is in fact the case, as\nderived from our PIMC simulations. In Fig. 5 we display\nthe difference \u2206B = B4 \u2212 B3 as a function of pressure\nat T = 25 K. For example, at 1 GPa and 25 K we find\nB = 4.40 and 4.50 \u00b1 0.01 GPa for 3 He and 4 He, respectively, and the difference between both isotopes amounts\nto 2.2%. At the same temperature and 7 GPa, we obtained B = 26.20 and 26.59 GPa, which translates to a\nrelative difference of 1.5%. This relative change in bulk\nmodulus associated to the isotopic mass is appreciable,\nand slightly larger than that found for the isotopic effect on the molar volume of helium crystals. Thus, at\na pressure of 1 and 7 GPa and T = 25 K, we find a\nvolume difference of 1.8 and 0.9%, when comparing 3 He\nand 4 He [24]. In general, given a temperature, the relative changes in volume and compressibility decrease for\nincreasing pressure, since the solid behaves as if it was\n\"more classical\" [30, 49], and isotopic effects (of quantum\norigin) are consequently reduced.\n\n0.3\n\nhcp\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nfcc\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n8\n\n4.8\n\nfcc 4He\n\n4.6\n4.4\n\nNVT\n\n4.2\n4\n\nNPT\nP = 1 GPa\n\nThermal expansion\n\nAt this point, it is worthwhile comparing the temperature dependence of the bulk modulus obtained at fixed\nvolume and fixed pressure, from PIMC simulations in the\nN V T and N P T ensembles, respectively. In Fig. 6 we\nhave plotted our results for B, as derived in both cases.\nOn one side, the simulations in the isothermal-isobaric\nensemble were carried out at a pressure P = 1 GPa, and\nthe results obtained are represented in Fig. 6 as circles.\nOn the other side, simulations in the canonical ensemble\n(at various temperatures) were performed for the volume\nobtained in N P T simulations at T = 25 K and P = 1\nGPa. Results of these N V T simulations are displayed as\nopen squares. As expected, B obtained in both types of\nsimulations agree with each other (within error bars) at\nT \u2264 25 K. At higher temperatures, the N P T simulations\nyield values of the bulk modulus smaller than those derived from N V T simulations. This is due to the thermal\n\n6\n\nFIG. 5: Isotopic effect on the isothermal bulk modulus as a\nfunction of pressure.

In connection with\nEq. (5), we note that the pressure obtained in N V T\nsimulations (with a fixed lattice parameter a = 3.6955\n\u00c5) increases from 1 GPa to 1.3 GPa when temperature\nrises from 25 to 75 K. At 25 K, we have B = 4.46 GPa\nand (\u2202P /\u2202T )V = 8.87 \u00d7 10\u22124 GPa K\u22121 , giving \u03b1N V T =\n1.99 \u00d7 10\u22124 K\u22121 . This result is in agreement with that\nfound directly from the volume change obtained in the\nN P T simulations, which yields \u03b1N P T = 2.03 \u00d7 10\u22124K\u22121 .\nFinally, in Fig. 7 we present results of the thermal\nexpansion coefficient \u03b1 yielded by our simulations in the\nisothermal-isobaric ensemble at two (high) pressures. We\ngive values for both 3 He and 4 He in the hcp phase. First,\nwe observe an important decrease in \u03b1 as the pressure is\nraised. For 4 He at 300 K, we find a reduction in \u03b1 by\na factor of five, when increasing P from 12 to 52 GPa.\nSecond, we note that the thermal expansion is smaller\nfor 3 He than for 4 He. This is easy to understand, since\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nPath-integral Monte Carlo simulations in both N V T\nand N P T ensembles have been shown to be well suited to\nanalyse the temperature and pressure dependence of the\nbulk modulus of solid helium. In the isothermal-isobaric\nensemble, B can be derived from the volume fluctuations\nalong a simulation run. In the canonical ensemble, a calculation of B is more elaborate, but can be carried out\nfrom thermal averages of various intermediate quantities\nobtained in PIMC simulations. Both ensembles N V T\nand N P T give consistent results for the compressibility\nand thermal expansion of 3 He and 4 He in the whole region of temperatures and pressures considered here.\nAt a given pressure, the bulk modulus decreases as\ntemperature rises. For pressures between 4 and 10 GPa,\nthe change in B has been found to be on the order of\n10%, when temperature increases from the low-T limit\nto the melting temperature of the material.\nSolid 3 He is more compressible than 4 He. At a given\nT , the difference between bulk modulus of both solids\nincreases as pressure rises, but the relative difference between them decreases. This isotopic effect on the compressibility of solid helium is appreciable in the range of\ntemperatures and pressures studied here. In fact, at 25\nK and pressures on the order of 1 GPa, it amounts to\nabout 2%.\nApart from a precise calculation of the bulk modulus,\nPIMC simulations in the canonical ensemble can be also\nused to study accurately the thermal expansion of the\nsolids under consideration at a given pressure.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author benefited from useful discussions with\nR.
