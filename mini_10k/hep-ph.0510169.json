It was obtained that \u03be(0) \u2243 \u22120.02.\n\nThe semileptonic decays of kaons afford an interesting opportunity to study the\nquark currents. The isotopic symmetry of the strong interactions is successfully used\nfor calculations of such processes. This appears to be an illustration of a definite\nfactorization of the strong and weak interactions at low energies. This circumstance\nallows us to reveal mechanisms of the quark currents outside the framework of\nphenomenological approach. The semileptonic decay K + \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc (K\u03bc3 ), well\nstudied experimentally, offers an interesting opportunity for such study.\nWe consider the K\u03bc3 decay (Fig. 1)\nK + (pK ) \u2192 \u03c0 0 (p\u03c0 ) + \u03bc+ (p\u03bc ) + \u03bd\u03bc (p\u03bd ).\n\n(1)\n\nThe tree diagram of this decay is shown in (Fig. 1). The general structure of the\nLagrangian of this decay is given by\nGF\nLW = \u2212 \u221a sin\u03b8C Jl+\u03bc Jh\u03bc ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Jl+\u03bc is the weak leptonic current. It reads\nJl+\u03bc = \u016b(p\u03bd )\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )v(p\u03bc ),\n\n(3)\n\nand the phenomenological matrix element of the strangeness changing vector current\nJh\u03bc can be expanded in the following form\nJh\u03bc = h\u03c0 0 |s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc u|K + i\n1\n= \u221a [f+ (t)(pK + p\u03c0 )\u03bc + f\u2212 (t)(pK \u2212 p\u03c0 )\u03bc ],\n2\n1\n\n(4)\n\n\f\u0001\n\u00190\n\nK+\n\n\u0016+\n\u0017\u0016\n\nFigure 1: The tree diagram of the K\u03bc3 decay.\n\nwhere t = (pK \u2212 p\u03c0 )2 is the four-momentum transfer squared of mesons to the\nleptons.\nIt is accepted to consider that in this case only vector part of the weak hadronic\ncurrent works. The matrix element of the axial-vector current is a pseudovector. It\nis impossible to construct a pseudovector from two momenta. In the case of the exact\nSU(3) symmetry, f+ (0) = 1 and f\u2212 (0) = 0. The physical situation corresponds to\nthe disturbed SU(3) symmetry. The form factors f\u00b1 (t) are represented as\nf\u00b1 (t) = f\u00b1 (0)(1 + \u03bb\u00b1\n\nt\n),\nm2\u03c0+\n\n(5)\n\nwhere parameter \u03bb+ \u2243 0.028 [1].\nParameter \u03be(0) is determined as the ratio of the two vector form factors\n\u03be(0) = f\u2212 (0)/f+ (0).\n\n(6)\n\nThe value of \u03be(0) can be obtained by three different methods: by measuring\nthe muon polarization, by studying the Dalitz plot of the K\u03bc3 decay, and also\nfrom the \u0393(K\u03bc3 )/\u0393(Ke3 ) ratio [1]. The consistent experimental values of \u03be \u223c\n\u22120.1 are obtained from \u03bb+ , \u03bb0 and \u03bb+ - \u03bb0 measurement [2] and from the ratio\n\u0393(K\u03bc3 )/\u0393(Ke3 ) [3]. The results of these experiments demonstrate a recovery of the\nSU(3) symmetry because \u03be(0) \u2192 0. But the mechanism of such recovery is not yet\nwell understood.\nIn the Standard Model (SM), the amplitude of the K\u03bc3 decay is given by\nGF\nsin\u03b8C \u016b(p\u03bd )\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )v(p\u03bc )[f+ (t)(pK + p\u03c0 )\u03bc + f\u2212 (t)(pK \u2212 p\u03c0 )\u03bc ]\n2\n1\n= \u2212GF sin\u03b8C f+ \u016b(p\u03bd )[\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )(pK )\u03bc \u2212 (\u03be(t) \u2212 1)m\u03bc (1 + \u03b35 )]v(p\u03bc ), (7)\n2\nwhere \u03b8C is the Cabibbo angle, and GF is the Fermi coupling constant.\nThe amplitude of K\u03bc3 decay (7) in the K + rest frame can be represented as\nT = \u2212\n\n1\nT = \u2212GF sin\u03b8C f+ \u016b(p\u03bd )[\u03b3 0 (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )mK \u2212 (\u03be(t) \u2212 1)m\u03bc (1 + \u03b35 )]v(p\u03bc ).\n2\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\f\u0001\n\nIn the SM the main contribution to amplitude (7) of the K\u03bc3 decay at the quark\nlevel is described by diagram (Fig. 2). In the spectator model, we consider below,\nu\n\nu\u0016\n\ns\u0016\n\nW+\n\n\u0016+\n\n\u0017\u0016\n\nFigure 2: The diagram of the K\u03bc3 decay at quark level.\nthe strange quark s\u0304 interacts with the W + boson and transforms into \u016b quark.\nThe u quark continues independent motion. The subsequent strong interaction in\na final state and fragmentation into a pion do not influence an angular distribution\nof leptons and the muon polarization. We do not include in this approach possible\ncontributions to K\u03bc3 decay from various extensions of the SM, because these nonSM models are strongly constrained from the experimental search for T-violation in\nthis decay [4].\nThe amplitude of the diagram (Fig. 2) in the spectator model can be written as\nGF\nT 1 = \u2212 \u221a sin\u03b8C v\u0304(ps )\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )v(pu )\u016b(p\u03bd )\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )v(p\u03bc ),\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere ps and pu are the momenta of s\u0304 and \u016b quark, respectively.\nThese objects s\u0304 and \u016b can be current quarks, but we assume that they are\nconstituent quarks. Such interpretation is proven due to the experimental test of a\nnumber of relations between amplitudes and cross sections. These ratios are derived\nin the framework of the impulse approximation of the additive quark model [5]. In a\nsimple approach [6], there is a prediction for the existence of a soft scalar interaction\nof constituent quarks in a hadron, and the spin-spin interaction can be large. For\nexample, it results in a considerable difference of masses of \u03c0 and \u03c1 mesons. We\nassume that constituent quarks are non-relativistic. Taking into account the shortdistance nature of the weak interaction, we can use an impulse approximation to\ninteracting quarks within the framework of the spectator model.\nAs it was mentioned above, only vector part of the weak hadronic current contributes to the K\u03bc3 decay. We will further use the Gordon identity for the vector\ncurrent of the constituent s\u0304 and \u016b quarks\nv\u0304(ps )\u03b3\u03bc v(pu ) =\n\n1\nv\u0304(ps )[\u2212(ps + pu )\u03bc + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd (ps \u2212 pu )\u03bd ]v(pu ),\nms + mu\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\n1\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03b3\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd \u2212 \u03b3\u03bd \u03b3\u03bc ),\n2\nms is the rest mass of the constituent s\u0304 quark, and mu is the rest mass of the\nconstituent \u016b quark in pion. It follows from Eq. (10) that the tensor contribution\n3\n\n\fshould be added. However, the experimental study of the decay K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e\u00b1 \u03bd\nstrongly constraints the contribution of the tensor interaction to a few per cent level\nat (90% C.L.) [7, 8]. Therefore, we omit tensor coupling in our approach. So, using\nEq. (10), we can present amplitude (9) as\nGF\n1\nv\u0304(ps )(ps + pu )\u03bc v(pu )\u016b(p\u03bd )\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )v(p\u03bc ).\nT 1 = \u221a sin\u03b8C\nm\n+\nm\n2\ns\nu\n\n(11)\n\nIn the spectator model\n(ps )\u03bc = (pu )\u03bc + (p\u03bc )\u03bc + (p\u03bd )\u03bc ,\n\n(12)\n\nand\nGF\n1\nv\u0304(ps )(2ps \u2212 p\u03bc \u2212 p\u03bd )\u03bc v(pu )\u016b(p\u03bd )\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )v(p\u03bc )\nT 1 = \u221a sin\u03b8C\nms + mu\n2\nGF\nv\u0304(ps )v(pu )\n= \u221a sin\u03b8C\n\u016b(p\u03bd )(\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )2(ps )\u03bc + m\u03bc (1 + \u03b35 ))v(p\u03bc ).

Then, it corresponds to the amplitude (7), and\nit is correct at small t.

For example, for the \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ \u03bde decay (exact SU(2) symmetry, \u03be(0) = 0)\nthis approximation is not justified. Therefore, expression (16) has no sense for the\nprecise unitary symmetry and can not be extrapolated to the \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ \u03bde decay. It\nis important that the constituent mass of the strange quark is used in this formula.\nLet us consider a simple non-relativistic model of constituent quarks with a spinspin interaction for mesons [6]:\nVs = \u03b2M\n\nS1 S2\n,\nm1 m2\n4\n\n(17)\n\n\fwhere Vs is the spin-spin interaction, Si is the spin of constituent quark, mi is the\nmass of constituent quark, \u03b2M is the constant of the spin-spin interaction,\nm\u03c0\nm\u03c1\nmK\nmK \u2217\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n2mu + E0M \u2212 (3/4)\u03b2M m\u22122\nu ,\nM\n\u22122\n2mu + E0 + (1/4)\u03b2M mu ,\n\u22121\nmu + ms + E0M \u2212 (3/4)\u03b2M m\u22121\nu ms ,\n\u22121\nmu + ms + E0M + (1/4)\u03b2M m\u22121\nu ms .\n\n(18)\n\nHere, E0M is the scalar interaction, which is supposed to be small. Then, from (18)\nwe have\nm\u03c0 + 3m\u03c1\nmu \u2243\n\u2243 0.305 GeV,\n(19)\n8\nmK + 3mK \u2217\n\u2243 0.792 GeV.\n(20)\n4\nUsing equations (16,19,20) one can obtain\nmK\n\u03be =1\u2212\n\u2243 \u2212 0.02.\n(21)\nms\nThe accuracy of \u03be in this approach is about 0.1 and determined by the uncertainty\nof the constituent s-quark mass of the model [6]. From the expression (16), the\nmechanism of the recovery of the unitary symmetry relative to the value \u03be is seen.\nThe extraction of \u03be(0) with small uncertainty is possible in the experiment E246 [9],\nwhere the normal polarization of the muon in the K\u03bc3 decay is expected to be\nmeasured with high statistics and small systematic errors. The further precise measurement of \u03be in the K\u03bc3 decay will allow us to establish the mechanism of quark\ncurrents of week interactions.\nmu + ms \u2243\n\nReferences\n[1] S. Eidelman et al.
