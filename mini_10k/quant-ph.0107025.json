INTRODUCTION\n\nIn quantum mechanics, it is axiomatic that the only allowed values of an observable\nare its eigenvalues. With these allowed values come, in turn, allowed interpretations. For\nexample, a quantum particle can tunnel through a potential energy barrier greater than\nits total energy. Can it have negative kinetic energy? The axiomatic answer is \"No! The\neigenvalues of kinetic energy are all positive!\" This answer does not allow us an intuitive\ninterpretation of quantum tunneling as a negative kinetic energy phenomen. But we can go\nbeyond the axiomatic answer to define the weak value hAiw of an observable A on a system\n[1,2]:\nhAiw =\n\nh\u03a8f in |A|\u03a8in i\nh\u03a8f in |\u03a8in i\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nHere |\u03a8in i and |\u03a8f in i are, respectively, the states of the system before and after a measurement of A. (Just as we can preselect |\u03a8in i, we can postselect |\u03a8f in i; thus we measure\nA on a pre- and postselected ensemble.) Weak values are measurable. If the measurement\ninteraction is weak enough [1,2], measurements on a pre- and postselected ensemble yield the\nweak value hAiw ; and hAiw need not be an eigenvalue. Indeed, it need not be any classically\nallowed value. The weak kinetic energy of a tunnelling particle is negative [3]. Weak values\nallow many new interpretations, in addition to negative kinetic energy. Here we show that\nthe weak speed of a particle can exceed the speed of light, and we discuss the consistency\nof weak values.\nWe will begin by showing how the weak speed of a charged particle can exceed the speed\nof light in vacuo. Such behavior seems completely inconsistent with the laws of physics. But\nwe then compute the electromagnetic field of the particle and find that it corresponds to\nCherenkov radiation: like any charged particle moving faster than light through a medium, a\nsuperluminal particle emits Cherenkov radiation. Finally, we prove that superluminal weak\nspeed does not contradict relativistic causality. Weak speed illustrates the general principle\nthat all values measured on a pre- and postselected ensemble are consistent.\n2\n\n\fII. QUANTUM WALK\n\nConsider a particle constrained to move along the z-axis. As a model Hamiltonian for\nour particle, we take H = pz vz , where pz = \u2212ih\u0304\u2202/\u2202z and vz acts on an internal Hilbert\nspace of the particle:\nvz =\n\nN\nc X\n\u03c3 (i)\nN i=1 z\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Pauli matrices operate on the internal Hilbert space. (They do not represent spin-the\nparticle has no electric or magnetic dipole moment.) The eigenvalues of vz are \u2212c, \u2212c +\n2c/N, . . . , c \u2212 2c/N, c, where c is the speed of light. The particle moves with velocity vz in\nthe z-direction,\n\u1e8b = [x, H]/ih\u0304 = 0 ,\n\n\u1e8f = [y, H]/ih\u0304 = 0 ,\n\n\u017c = [z, H]/ih\u0304 = vz\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nhence the change in position z is a measure of vz .\nIf the only allowed values of vz are its eigenvalues, the speed of the particle cannot exceed\nthe speed of light. But consider the following weak measurement of vz . We preselect the\nparticle in an initial state |\u03a8in i\u03a6(x, 0), where \u03a6(x, 0) represents a particle approximately\nlocalized at x = (x, y, z) = 0,\n\u03a6(x, 0) = (\u01eb2 \u03c0)\u22123/4 e\u2212x\n\n2 /2\u01eb2\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nand postselect a final state |\u03a8f in i. For |\u03a8in i and |\u03a8f in i we choose\n|\u03a8in i = 2\u2212N/2 \u2297N\ni=1 (| \u2191i i + | \u2193i i)\n|\u03a8f in i = \u2297N\ni=1 (\u03b1\u2191 | \u2191i i + \u03b1\u2193 | \u2193i i)\n\n,\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u03b1\u2191 and \u03b1\u2193 real and \u03b1\u21912 + \u03b1\u21932 = 1. Our chances of postselecting the state |\u03a8f in i may be\nvery small, but if we repeat the experiment again and again, eventually we will postselect\n|\u03a8f in i. Thus \u03a6(x, t) is\n\u03a6(x, t) = h\u03a8f in |e\u2212ipz vz t/h\u0304 |\u03a8in i\u03a6(x, 0) ,\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fup to normalization. For short enough times t, we can expand the exponent:\n\u03a6(x, t) \u2248 h\u03a8f in |1 \u2212 ipz vz t/h\u0304|\u03a8in i\u03a6(x, 0)\n= h\u03a8f in |1 \u2212 ipz hvz iw t/h\u0304|\u03a8in i\u03a6(x, 0)\n\u2248 h\u03a8f in |e\u2212ipz hvz iw t/h\u0304 |\u03a8in i\u03a6(x, 0)\n= h\u03a8f in |\u03a8in i\u03a6(x, y, z \u2212 hvz iw t, 0)\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nThus at time t the particle is displaced by hvz iw t along the z-axis. Note that the weak value\nof vz ,\nhvz iw =\n\nh\u03a8f in |vz |\u03a8in i\n\u03b1\u2191 \u2212 \u03b1\u2193\nc ,\n=\nh\u03a8f in |\u03a8in i\n\u03b1\u2191 + \u03b1\u2193\n\n(8)\n\nexceeds c in magnitude if \u03b1\u2191 \u03b1\u2193 is negative. Thus the weak speed of the particle could be\nsuperluminal.\nThis result is so surprising as to merit a second derivation. We can rewrite Eq. (6) by\nevaluating the exponent exactly:\n\u0010\n\n\u03a6(x, t) = 2\u2212N/2 \u03b1\u2191 e\u2212ipz ct/N h\u0304 + \u03b1\u2193 eipz ct/N h\u0304\n= 2\u2212N/2\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b1\u2191n \u03b1\u2193N \u2212n\n\nn=0\n\n\u0011N\n\n\u03a6(x, 0)\n\nN!\ne\u2212i(2n\u2212N )pz ct/N h\u0304 \u03a6(x, 0)\nn!(N \u2212 n)!\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nEq. (9) represents a superposition of many displacements of the particle. Applying the\nbinomial theorem, we find that \u03a6(x, t) is a superposition of \u03a6(x, 0) displaced along the zaxis by at most ct in either direction. So how can Eq. (6) represent a particle displaced by\nhvz iw t if hvz iw t is out of this range? Here is the surprise. Apparently the displaced states\ninterfere, constructively for z \u2248 hvz iw t and destructively for other values of z. Indeed, we\ncan verify this interference. Since\n\u03b1\u2191 e\u2212ipz ct/N h\u0304 + \u03b1\u2193 eipz ct/N h\u0304 \u2248 \u03b1\u2191 (1 \u2212 ipz ct/Nh\u0304) + \u03b1\u2193 (1 + ipz ct/Nh\u0304)\n= (\u03b1\u2191 + \u03b1\u2193 ) \u2212 (\u03b1\u2191 \u2212 \u03b1\u2193 )ipz ct/Nh\u0304\n= (\u03b1\u2191 + \u03b1\u2193 )(1 \u2212 ipz hvz iw t/Nh\u0304)\nand\n4\n\n(10)\n\n\flim (1 \u2212 ipz hvz iw t/Nh\u0304)N = e\u2212ipz hvz iw t/h\u0304\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwe find that, for large enough N, Eq. (9) does indeed imply Eq. (7).\nMathematically, Eq. (9) does not look like Eq. (7). Eq. (9) corresponds to a superposition\nof waves e\u2212ipz vz t/h\u0304 where vz = \u2212c, \u2212c + 2c/N, . . . , c \u2212 2c/N, c. If e\u2212ipz hvz iw t/h\u0304 is not one of\nthese waves, how can we obtain it by superposing them? Physically, Eq. (9) is analogous\nto a random walk. We can generate a random walk in one dimension by tossing a coin. In\nEq. (9), we toss a quantum coin-a spin-to generate a quantum random walk [4]. If the\ncoefficients \u03b1\u2191 and \u03b1\u2193 in Eq. (9) were probabilities, the expansion of Eq. (9) would generate\na classical random walk; each term in the expansion would represent a possible random\nwalk, with coefficient equal to its probability. A classical random walk of N steps yields\n\u221a\na typical displacement of N steps, and never more than N. But the coefficients \u03b1\u2191 and\n\u03b1\u2193 are probability amplitudes; the quantum random walk superposes all possible classical\nrandom walks and yields arbitrary displacements.\n\nIII. CONSISTENCY OF WEAK VALUES\n\nWe have derived Eq. (7) two ways, but we have not explained how such a surprising\nresult as superluminal speed could coexist with relativistic causality (i.e. the constraint\n\u2212c \u2264 vz \u2264 c that applies to vz and its eigenvalues.) The explanation is that superluminal\nspeed depends on apparent \"errors\" of measurement. A hint of this dependence appears\nalready in Eq. (4), where we define the initial wave function \u03a6(x, 0) of the particle to be\na gaussian with an uncertainty in position of about \u01eb. If \u01eb vanished, \u03a6(x, 0) would be a\ndelta-function of position and no superluminal behavior could emerge from Eq. (9); there\nwould be no tails on the wave function that could interfere constructively for z \u2248 hvz iw t.\nHowever, \u01eb does not vanish, our initial and final measurements are uncertain, and we can\nobtain, \"by error\", a displacement corresponding to superluminal speed. Thus the weak\nvalue emerges only if it could be an error; yet the weak value does not seem to be an error.\nOn the contrary, whenever our pre- and postselections (which are independent of \u03a6(x, 0))\n5\n\n\fyield the weak value hvz iw , measured values of the displacement of the particle over a time\nt cluster about hvz iw t.\nWe can quantify the dependence of weak speed on measurement error as follows. Eqs.\n(7) and (9) agree in the limit N \u2192 \u221e, but let us take into account the fact that N is finite.\nTo do so, we define a function f (1/N) = (1 + s/N)N with s constant, and expand f (1/N)\nin a Taylor series expansion around f (0):\nf (1/N) = f (0) + f \u2032 (0)/N + f \u2032\u2032 (0)/2N 2 + . . .\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere f (0) = limN \u2192\u221e f (1/N), etc. We obtain\ns\n1+\nN\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013N\n\ns2\n3s4 + 8s3\n1\u2212\n+\n+ ...\n2N\n24N 2\n\n!\n\n= es\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\n\u03a6(x, 0) ,\n\n(14)\n\nHence Eqs. (9) and (10) imply\n\u2212ipz hvz iw t/h\u0304\n\n\u03a6(x, t) = e\n\np2 hvz i2w t2\n1\n1+ z\n+O\n2\nN2\n2Nh\u0304\n\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013#\n\nup to normalization. The exponential factor outside the brackets displaces \u03a6(x, 0) by hvz iw t\nbut terms of order 1/N can change the shape of \u03a6(x, 0). To make the change negligible, we\nrequire\n1 \u226b hvz i2w t2 /N\u01eb2\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nEq. (15) relates N to the width \u01eb of \u03a6(x, 0): to decrease \u01eb, we increase N. As long as Eq.\n(15) holds, the particle will move with weak speed hvz iw over a time t.\nEq. (15) is crucial to the consistency of weak speed. Does it seem that we get superluminal speed by playing a \"game of errors\" with the measuring device? Perhaps; but it is a\nremarkably consistent game: whenever we preselect |\u03a8in i and postselect |\u03a8f in i of Eq. (5),\nwe get superluminal speed (up to the uncertainty that characterizes the measuring device).\nFor this consistency to hold, the probability of postselecting |\u03a8f in i must be smaller than\nthe probability of getting the superluminal speed \"by error\". Otherwise, when we postselect\n|\u03a8f in i, we would most likely not get superluminal speed.\n6\n\n\fLet's check: on the one hand, a particle with wave function \u03a6(x, 0) may be found, by\nerror, at z = hvz iw t a time t later. The probability of such an error is proportional to\n2 2 /\u01eb2\n\ne\u2212hvz iw t\n\n, which by Eq. (15) is much greater than e\u2212N . On the other hand, the probability\n\nof postselecting the state |\u03a8f in i is approximately (\u03b1\u2191 \u03b1\u2193 + 1/2)N . If we compare the two\nprobabilities and recall that \u03b1\u2191 \u03b1\u2193 is negative for hvz iw > c, we find that the probability of\nan error dominates the probability of postselecting |\u03a8f in i.\nThen why all the fuss about postselection? If we measure vz and obtain the value\nvz > c, what does it matter whether or not we postselect? The answer is that only if\nwe postselect are measured values consistent. An example may help clarify this answer.\nSuppose we measure the displacement of the particle at time t with a weak measurement\n\u221a\ninteraction. If we don't postselect, the most likely displacement at time t is ct/ N , because\nthe expectation value of vz in the state |\u03a8in i is a random walk of N steps of size c/N. Yet\nthere is a small chance of obtaining a displacement ct. Such a value might be an error and,\nindeed, if we remeasure z, there is again only a small chance of measuring such a large\ndisplacement. Since each measurement hardly disturbs the particle [5], the probability that\nthe next measurement yields a displacement ct remains small. Thus, without postselection,\nthere is no consistency in measurement errors. Unless and until we postselect, they are\njust errors. With postselection, however, measurement \"errors\" yield a consistent pattern.\nRepeated weak measurements on an ensemble of particles preselected in the state |\u03a8in i and\npostselected in the state |\u03a8f in i yield \"errors\" consistent with the superluminal weak value.\nEqs. (7) and (9) show that the weak speed of a particle can consistently exceed c. We\nnow give the particle a charge q and show that its electromagnetic field, too, is consistent\nwith superluminal weak speed.\n\nIV. CHERENKOV RADIATION\n\nWhat is the electromagnetic field of the particle? Let us treat the scalar potential; the\ntreatment of the vector potential is similar. To begin with, suppose that vz is well defined,\n7\n\n\fi.e. that vz equals one of its eigenvalues. Let V (x\u2032 , t; vz ) denote the scalar potential at\nx\u2032 , t of a particle of charge q moving along the z-axis with z = vz t. The simplest way to\nobtain V (x\u2032 , t; vz ) is via a Lorentz boost, by vz in the z-direction, of the Coulomb potential\nV (x\u2032 , t; 0). We obtain\nn\n\nV (x\u2032 , t; vz ) = q [(x\u2032 )2 + (y \u2032)2 ](1 \u2212 vz2 /c2 ) + (z \u2032 \u2212 vz t)2\n\no\u22121/2\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nSo far, V (x\u2032 , t; vz ) represents the classical potential of a point charge moving along the\naxis with z = vz t. But we want to treat the field as quantum mechanical. We could do\nso with quantum field operators, but the treatment would be unnecessarily complicated.\nInstead, let us write down an effective two-particle interaction between the moving charge\nand a test particle. Namely, to H = pz vz , the Hamiltonian of the moving charge, we add\nthe Hamiltonian H \u2032 of a (nonrelativistic) test particle:\nH\u2032 =\n\n1\n2\n(p\u2032 \u2212 q \u2032 A) + q \u2032 V\n2m\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nIn H \u2032 , the test particle has charge q \u2032 , and the scalar potential is\nV (x\u2032 ) = q\n\nnh\n\ni\n\n(x\u2032 \u2212 x)2 + (y \u2032 \u2212 y)2 (1 \u2212 vz2 /c2 ) + (z \u2032 \u2212 z)2\n\no\u22121/2\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nThe vector potential has only one nonzero component, namely Az , which is [6]\nAz (x\u2032 ) =\n\no\u22121/2\ni\nqvz nh \u2032\n(x \u2212 x)2 + (y \u2032 \u2212 y)2 (1 \u2212 vz2 /c2 ) + (z \u2032 \u2212 z)2\nc\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nNote that if we substitute (0, 0, vz t) for (x, y, z), then V (x\u2032 ) equals V (x\u2032 , t; vz ) as defined\nabove in Eq. (16) and Az (x\u2032 ) equals (vz /c)V (x\u2032 , t; vz ). The equations of motion flowing from\nH + H \u2032 yield (x, y, z) = (0, 0, vz t) together with the correct motion of the test particle due to\nthe electromagnetic field of the moving charge. (The equation of motion for the momentum\np of the moving charge is unphysical, but it has no measurable consequences.) Now we treat\nV and Az as quantum operators and calculate their effect on the test particle. We will see\nthat if the moving charge has weak speed hvz iw then hvz iw replaces vz in Eqs. (18-19).\nNamely, suppose we preselect the moving charge in the state |\u03a8in i\u03a6(x, 0) and, after a\ntime T , postselect the state |\u03a8f in i. (See Eqs. (4-5).) We also prepare the test particle in\n8\n\n\fa localized state \u03a9(x\u2032 , 0), where \u03a9(x\u2032 , 0) is analytic in x\u2032 . For simplicity, and because we\nwant the test particle to measure the instantaneous values of Az and V at the end of this\nevolution (and not their average values during or after the evolution), we \"turn on\" H \u2032\ninstantaneously at time T , i.e. we multiply H \u2032 by \u03b4(t \u2212 T ). The state of the moving charge\nand the test particle after the postselection is then\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n2 /2m+q \u2032 V\n\n\u03a6(x, T )\u03a9(x\u2032 , T ) = h\u03a8f in |e\u2212i[(p \u2212q A)\n\n]/h\u0304 \u2212ipz vz T /h\u0304\n\ne\n\n|\u03a8in i\u03a6(x, 0)\u03a9(x\u2032 , 0)\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nThe potentials V and A in Eq. (20) are defined by Eqs. (18-19). But we now show that the\nweak speed hvz iw replaces vz in Eqs. (18-20). Here we present a short proof, while Appendix\nB contains a long rigorous proof.\nLet us focus on the right-hand side of Eq. (20) and note that we can expand the first\nexponential,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n2 /2m+q \u2032 V\n\ne\u2212i[(p \u2212q A)\n\n]/h\u0304\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nas a power series in vz . Thus, the right-hand side of Eq. (20) is a sum of terms of the form\nh\u03a8f in |vzn e\u2212ipz vz T /h\u0304 |\u03a8in i\n\n(22)\n\nmultiplied on either side by functions that do not depend on vz . But we have, for any n and\nin the limit N \u2192 \u221e,\nh\u03a8f in |vzn e\u2212ipz vz T /h\u0304 |\u03a8in i\n\n=\n\nih\u0304 \u2202\nT \u2202pz\n\n!n\n\nh\u03a8f in |e\u2212ipz vz T /h\u0304 |\u03a8in i\n\nih\u0304 \u2202\n= h\u03a8f in |\u03a8in i\nT \u2202pz\n\n!n\n\ne\u2212ipz hvz iw T /h\u0304\n\n= h\u03a8f in |\u03a8in i(hvz iw )n e\u2212ipz hvz iw T /h\u0304\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\n(Compare Eqs. (6-11).) So we can simply replace vz by hvz iw everywhere it appears in the\nseries. We drop the factor h\u03a8f in |\u03a8in i (to normalize) and obtain\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n2 /2m+q \u2032 V\n\n\u03a6(x, T )\u03a9(x\u2032 , T ) = e\u2212i[(p \u2212q A)\n\n]/h\u0304\n\nwhere\n9\n\n\u03a6(x, y, z \u2212 hvz iw T, 0)\u03a9(x\u2032 , 0) ,\n\n(24)\n\n\fAz = (hvz iw /c)V = (hvz iw /c)V (x\u2032 \u2212 x, 0; hvz iw )\n\n.\n\n(25)\n\nSince V (x\u2032 \u2212 x, 0; hvz iw ) equals V (x\u2032 ) as defined in Eq. (18) with hvz iw taking the place of\nvz , the scalar and vector potentials are exactly the potentials of a charge moving with weak\nspeed hvz iw (folded with the width of the localized state \u03a6) and have the corresponding\neffect on the test particle. Now if hvz iw exceeds the speed of light, V and Az correspond to\nCherenkov radiation, the shock wave of a charged particle moving faster than light through\na medium.\nCherenkov radiation is a striking illustration of the principle that all weak values measured on a pre- and postselected ensemble are consistent. There is more consistency here\nthan what we have noted. We have shown that a particle emits weak Cherenkov radiation\nconsistent with its superluminal weak speed. But we need not limit ourselves to the Hamiltonian H \u2032 in Eq. (17). Given any Hamiltonian H \u2032 (vz ) that is analytic in vz , we can write the\ntime evolution operator e\u2212i\n\nR\n\nH \u2032 (vz )dt/h\u0304\n\nas a power series in vz , and then, as before, replace vz\n\nby hvz iw . And what holds for weak speed holds for other weak values.\nWith our effective two-particle interaction H \u2032 , we have neglected the radiation modes\nof the electromagnetic field, just as we often neglect these radiation modes in treating the\ninteraction between two charged particles via the Coulomb potential. When can we consistently neglect the radiation modes? A particle of charge q reveals its position through\nits electromagnetic field; each mode of the electromagnetic field is, in effect, a measuring\ndevice. What assures us that the superposition of localized states in Eq. (20) lasts a time\nT , if each localized state has a distinct electromagnetic field? In other words, how can we\npostselect the state |\u03a8f in i if the radiation modes can reduce the superposition to a localized\nstate corresponding to one eigenvalue of vz ?\nThe answer to this question depends on the magnitude of the charge q. If q is large, \u03a6(x, t)\nwill not long remain a superposition of localized states. Each state in the superposition\ncorresponds to the charge moving at a different point along the z-axis, localized to within\n\u2206z \u2248 \u01eb. We assume this uncertainty conforms to Eq. (15). But if q is large enough, the\n10\n\n\fradiation modes will measure the location of the charge and reduce the uncertainty \u2206z to\nless than what Eq. (15) allows, thereby reducing the superposition in Eq. (20). Conversely\nif q is small, vacuum fluctuations will dominate, and the radiation modes will not reduce\nthe uncertainty \u2206z to less than what Eq. (15) allows.\nWe can sharpen this question by imagining an observer at a distance D from the moving\ncharge, who may or may not measure its electric field to determine its position (and thus\nits speed). If there is a measurement, it reduces the superposition in Eq. (20) to a single\nlocalized state; then we cannot postselect |\u03a8f in i and there will be no Cherenkov radiation.\nBut if there is no measurement, and we postselect |\u03a8f in i, there will be Cherenkov radiation.\nCan this observer violate causality? As long as D \u2264 cT , there is no problem: the observer\nis close enough to the particle to causally affect the outcome (whether or not it emits\nCherenkov radiation). But for D > cT , the observer cannot causally affect the particle\nbefore it emits Cherenkov radiation! We are left with an apparent violation of causality;\nhow can the radiation from the particle be consistent with later measurements?\nTo answer the question, let us suppose the observer locates the particle by measuring its\nelectric field. At a distance D from the particle, the electric field strength E is E = q/D 2,\nthus D =\n\nq\n\nq/E. Then \u2206D = (D 3 /2q)\u2206E. Inferring the position z of the particle from this\n\nmeasurement of E, we have \u2206z \u2248 (D 3 /2q)\u2206E. The condition for a weak measurement of\nvz is Eq. (15), with \u2206z taking the place of \u01eb; that is,\n\u221a\n\nN (D 3 /2q)\u2206E \u2248\n\n\u221a\n\nSince we assume D \u2265 cT , Eq. (26) implies\n\nN (\u2206z) \u226b hvz iw T\n\n\u221a\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nND 2 \u2206E \u226b 2q. Now vacuum fluctuations in a\n\nregion of volume D 3 , over a time D/c, induce uncertainty in the electric field that is roughly\n\u221a\n\u2206E \u2248 h\u0304c/D 2 in magnitude [7]. Thus\nh\u0304c > 4q 2 /N\n\n(27)\n\nis the condition for weak measurement and Cherenkov radiation. If q satisfies Eq. (27), then\nweak Cherenkov radiation is consistent with causality. Indeed, even a strong interaction with\n11\n\n\fthe electromagnetic field can show Cherenkov radiation: for any given q, N must satisfy Eq.\n(27), and then measurements will show superluminal weak speed and Cherenkov radiation.\nFor q \u2248 e, N is approximately the inverse fine-structure constant; for larger q, N must be\nlarger, as well.\nThus Cherenkov radiation does not, by itself, imply superluminal weak speed; we must\nstill postselect |\u03a8f in i. Given the condition h\u0304c > 4q 2 /N, postselection of |\u03a8f in i implies\nCherenkov radiation, but the reverse does not hold: Cherenkov radiation does not imply\npostselection of |\u03a8f in i. Without postselection, Cherenkov radiation may be an error, a\nfluctuation of the vacuum.\nIn this example, we preselect |\u03a8in i and postselect |\u03a8f in i to get superluminal weak speed.\nIn Eq. (5), which defines these states, all the coefficients are real, and therefore the weak\nspeed is real. For other pre- and postselections, however, the weak speed could be complex.\nComplex weak values can induce nonunitary time evolution. An example we will present\nelsewhere, of an imaginary weak dipole moment, shows a remarkable interplay between\nimaginary weak values and entanglement. Here, however, we discuss only real weak values.\n\nV. RELATIVISTIC CAUSALITY\n\nWeak measurements-measurements that yield weak values-are internally consistent\nbecause they obey two rules. On the one hand, they are weak, hence they hardly disturb\nthe measured system. On the other hand, they are inaccurate and can yield, \"by error\",\nweak values. These two rules are intimately related. In our example, the change in the\ninitial wave function \u03a6(x, 0) is proportional to pz . Thus, for the measurement to be weak,\npz must be bounded. But if pz is bounded, then the wave function is analytic [3] in z. And\nsince \u03a6(x, 0) is analytic in z, the probability density does not vanish for any interval in z.\nThus we can localize the particle, \"by error\", in a region it could not have reached without\nsuperluminal speed. What if we were to try to eliminate the possibility of error, either by\nchoosing the initial wave function to be a Dirac delta function, or by otherwise imposing a\n12\n\n\fsharp cutoff on the initial wave function? In either case, the initial wave function would not\nbe an analytic function. But then the expansion of Eqs. (7) and (10) in powers of pz would\nnot be valid. The exponential of \u2212ipz vz t/h\u0304 in Eq. (6) is a unitary operator that translates\n\u03a6(x, 0) to \u03a6(x, y, z \u2212 vz t, 0). This unitary operator acts on any wave function with a Fourier\ntransform. But the Taylor series expansion of this unitary operator applied to \u03a6(x, 0),\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u2212ipz vz t/h\u0304)m\n\u03a6(x, 0) ,\nm!\nm=0\n\n(28)\n\nequals the Taylor series expansion of \u03a6(x, y, z \u2212 vz t, 0) around \u03a6(x, 0) only if \u03a6(x, 0) is an\nanalytic function. Thus the weak value hvz iw emerges in this experiment only if the initial\nwave function \u03a6(x, 0) is analytic.\nOnce we understand the role of analyticity in the emergence of hvz iw , we can answer\nanother question: How can hvz iw > c be consistent with relativistic causality? We have\nseen that the particle moves with velocity hvz iw only if \u03a6(x, 0) is analytic. But if \u03a6(x, 0) is\nanalytic, then its value and the value of its derivatives at any one point determine its value\nat all points. Hence \u03a6(x, t) = \u03a6(x, y, z \u2212 hvz iw t, 0) does not transmit any message, because\nit is the same message for all x and t. Since \u03a6(x, t) does not transmit any message, it does\nnot, in particular, transmit a superluminal message, and there is no violation of relativistic\ncausality.\nThus superluminal weak speed is consistent with relativistic causality and with other\nmeasurements. There are two distinct ways in which weak measurements can be consistent.\nOn the one hand, if a weak measurement of vz on a pre- and postselected ensemble yields\nhvz iw > c, any weak measurement of the electromagnetic field on the same pre- and postselected ensemble will show Cherenkov radiation. That is, weak measurements are consistent\nas long as they apply to the same pre- and postselected ensemble. On the other hand, if\nmeasurements do not apply to the same pre- and postselected ensemble, they are consistent\neven if they yield different measured values. For example, we can follow a weak measurement of vz with either a postselection or a precise measurement of vz . If we postselect the\nstate |\u03a8f in i, we interpret the result of the weak measurement as the weak value hvz iw ; if we\n13\n\n\fprecisely (re)measure vz , we may interpret the result of the weak measurement as an error.\nBut these two interpretations of a measured value are consistent, for they apply to different\nensembles-the former to a pre- and postselected ensemble and the latter to a preselected\nensemble. Thus, how we interpret a measured value depends on what we choose to measure next. Here we have considered weak measurements on a single pre- and postselected\nensemble. Together, these measurements yield a consistent picture of a charge moving in\nthe vacuum at superluminal speed and emitting Cherenkov radiation.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank a referee for comments that helped us write more clearly.\n\nAPPENDIX A:\n\nWe will prove [8] the following representation for V (x\u2032 , t; vz ):\nV (x\u2032 , t; vz ) = q\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c4\n\n\u03b4(t \u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 |x\u2032 \u2212 x|/c)\n|x\u2032 \u2212 x|\n\n.\n\n(A1)\n\nHere |x\u2032 \u2212x| = [(x\u2032 )2 +(y \u2032)2 +(z \u2032 \u2212vz \u03c4 )2 ]1/2 .

We first\nshow it in the limit m \u2192 \u221e, i.e. we first consider only the scalar potential V . Then we\ngeneralize to finite m and consider A too.\nLet us focus on the term in angle brackets in Eq. (20) and begin by noting that V (x\u2032 )\nas defined in Eq. (18) can also be written V (x\u2032 \u2212 x, 0; vz ) as defined in Eq. (16). Hence (in\nthe limit m \u2192 \u221e) we can write the term in angle brackets as\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nh\u03a8f in |e\u2212iq V /h\u0304 e\u2212ipz vz T /h\u0304 |\u03a8in i = h\u03a8f in |e\u2212iq V (x \u2212x,0;vz )/h\u0304 e\u2212ipz vz T /h\u0304 |\u03a8in i\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n= h\u03a8f in |e\u2212ipz vz T /h\u0304 e\u2212iq V (x \u2212x,T ;vz )/h\u0304 |\u03a8in i\n\n.\n\n(B1)\n\nThe trick is to take the dependence on vz out of V (x\u2032 \u2212 x, T ; vz ) and put it in a more\nconvenient place. To this end, we refer to the representation in Eq. (A1) and note that\nall the dependence on vz is contained in the expression |x\u2032 \u2212 x| which, for V (x\u2032 \u2212 x, T ; vz ),\nequals [(x\u2032 \u2212 x)2 + (y \u2032 \u2212 y)2 + (z \u2032 \u2212 z \u2212 vz \u03c4 )2 ]1/2 . It follows that the combination\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nM = eipz vz \u03c4 /h\u0304 e\u2212iq V (x \u2212x,T ;vz )/h\u0304 e\u2212ipz vz \u03c4 /h\u0304\n\n(B2)\n\nis actually independent of vz and we can write the term in angle brackets as\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nh\u03a8f in |e\u2212ipz vz T /h\u0304 e\u2212ipz vz \u03c4 /h\u0304 Meipz vz \u03c4 /h\u0304 |\u03a8in i ,\n\n(B3)\n\nwhere M is independent of vz . We would like to move M out of the angle brackets. Indeed\n\u2032\n\nwe can do so, even though M does not commute with eipz vz \u03c4 /h\u0304 . The reason is that we can\nalways write \u03a9(x\u2032 , 0) as a sum of Fourier components. For each Fourier component in the\n15\n\n\fsum, we can move M out of the angle brackets, and later move it back in; hence we can do\nso for the sum itself. Thus we can rewrite Eq. (B3) as\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nh\u03a8f in |e\u2212ipz vz T /h\u0304 e\u2212i(pz \u2212p\u0304z )vz \u03c4 /h\u0304 |\u03a8in iM = h\u03a8f in |\u03a8in ie\u2212ipz hvz iw T /h\u0304 e\u2212i(pz \u2212p\u0304z )hvz iw \u03c4 /h\u0304 M\n\n, (B4)\n\nwhere p\u0304\u2032z represents an eigenvalue of p\u2032z for a given Fourier component. (We have taken the\n\u2032\n\nlimit N \u2192 \u221e; compare Eqs. (6-11).) Now we can pull eip\u0304z hvz iw \u03c4 /h\u0304 back to the right side of\nM, turn p\u0304\u2032z back into p\u2032z , drop the factor h\u03a8f in |\u03a8in i (to normalize), and rewrite the term in\nangle brackets as\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2212ipz hvz iw T /h\u0304 e\u2212ipz hvz iw \u03c4 /h\u0304 Meipz hvz iw \u03c4 /h\u0304 = e\u2212ipz hvz iw T /h\u0304 e\u2212iq V (x \u2212x,T ;hvz iw )/h\u0304\n\n.\n\n(B5)\n\nApplying Eq. (B5) to the combined state \u03a6(x, 0)\u03a9(x\u2032 , 0) of the moving charge and the test\nparticle, we obtain at time T\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03a6(x, T )\u03a9(x\u2032 , T ) = e\u2212ipz hvz iw T /h\u0304 e\u2212iq V (x \u2212x,T ;hvz iw )/h\u0304 \u03a6(x, 0)\u03a9(x\u2032 , 0)\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n= e\u2212iq V (x \u2212x,0;hvz iw )/h\u0304 \u03a6(x, y, z \u2212 hvz iw T, 0)\u03a9(x\u2032 , 0)\n\n.\n\n(B6)\n\nEq. (B6) corresponds to Eqs. (24-25) in the limit m \u2192 \u221e.\nNow let m be finite. Since Az (x\u2032 ) equals (vz /c)V (x\u2032 ), we can define a representation of\nAz (x\u2032 , t; vz ) to be (vz /c) times the representation of V (x\u2032 , t; vz ) in Eq. (A1). But how do we\ndeal with this extra dependence on vz in Az (x\u2032 , t; vz )? We can expand the exponential term\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n2 /2m+q \u2032 V\n\ne\u2212i[(p \u2212q A)\n\n]/h\u0304\n\n(B7)\n\nin Eq. (20) as a Taylor series. If we then replace Az (x\u2032 ) = (vz /c)V (x\u2032 \u2212 x, 0; vz ) by its\nrepresentation, there will be powers of vz in the series. But we have, for any n and in the\nlimit N \u2192 \u221e,\n\u2032\n\u2032\nh\u03a8f in |vzn e\u2212i(pz T +pz \u03c4 \u2212p\u0304z \u03c4 )vz /h\u0304 |\u03a8in i\n\n=\n\nih\u0304 \u2202\nT \u2202pz\n\n!n\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nh\u03a8f in |e\u2212i(pz T +pz \u03c4 \u2212p\u0304z \u03c4 )vz /h\u0304 |\u03a8in i\n\nih\u0304 \u2202\n= h\u03a8f in |\u03a8in i\nT \u2202pz\n\n!n\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2212i(pz T +pz \u03c4 \u2212p\u0304z \u03c4 )hvz iw /h\u0304\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n= h\u03a8f in |\u03a8in i(hvz iw )n e\u2212i(pz T +pz \u03c4 \u2212p\u0304z \u03c4 )hvz iw /h\u0304\n\n,\n\n(B8)\n\nso we can replace vz by hvz iw everywhere it appears in the series. Then we obtain Eqs.\n(24-25) as the generalization of Eq. (B6).\n16\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] Y. Aharonov, D. Albert, and L. Vaidman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 1351 (1988).\n[2] Y. Aharonov and L.
