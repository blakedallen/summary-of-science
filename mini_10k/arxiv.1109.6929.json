We investigate the electric current as a function of gate length and\ntemperature. Under the action of an external electrical field we show that even for gate lengths up\n100 \u00c5, a non zero current is exhibited. The results can be explained by the presence of a tunneling\nregime due the remanescent states in the gap. We also discuss the conditions to reach the charge\nneutrality point in a system free of defects and extrinsic carrier doping.\nPACS numbers: 72.80.Vp,85.30.Tv,73.23.Ad,71.15.Mb\n\nThere is a consensus in the scientific community\nthat the scaling down of silicon-based metal-oxidesemiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) is approaching its limits. Therefore, there is a pursuit for different materials to replace the silicon paradigm1 . Among\nthe potential candidates, graphene has attracted the attention of research groups after the seminal work of the\nManchester group2 . Graphene is a truly two-dimensional\n(2D) material, with a honeycomb structure, and is a\nzero band-gap semiconductor. The valence and conduction bands close to the Fermi level are cone shaped,\nwith a linear energy-momentum relation at the two k\npoints (K and K \u2032 ) of the Brillouin zone, called Dirac\npoints3 . As a result, graphene has several properties that\nmake it very interesting to use in the manufacture of devices, such as its very high electronic mobilities, up to\n200 000 cm2 V \u22121 s\u221214,5 , with electrons and holes behaving as massless fermions near the K and K \u2032 points. Thus,\ncharge carriers can travel for micrometers at room temperature without any scattering.\nHowever, a drawback in using graphene as an electronic material, such as in logic devices, is its lack of an\nenergy gap. A number of different approaches have been\nproposed to open such a bandgap on graphene6\u201310 . Another way to create the gap is to use bilayer graphene,\nbreaking the inversion symmetry through an external\nperturbation, such as the application of an electrical field\nperpendicular to the layers. Moreover, this band gap can\nbe tuned by varying the field strength. This fact has been\nconfirmed by both photoemission and optical absorption\nexperiments11\u201313 . A few theoretical studies have also investigated this approach to open a band gap in bilayer\ngraphene via the application of an electric field along the\nwhole system14,15 . Recently, Avouris' group observed a\ntransport band gap in biased bilayer graphene16 , also\ndemonstrating its potential for applications in digital\nelectronics. Thus, understanding the intrinsic properties\nof devices based on bilayer graphene in nano-dimensions\nis important for future developments in the area.\nIn this Brief Report we present investigations of the\nelectronic transport properties of a dual-gated bilayer\ngraphene nanodevice, as a function of the gate length\n(Lgate ) and temperature, via first-principles calculations.\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic view of a dual-gated bilayer graphene.\n\nWe show an exponential decrease of the current as a function of the gate length, which is characteristic of a tunneling regime. As a result, the system does not reach a zero\ncurrent. Also, we discuss the conditions to achieve the\ncharge neutrality point (CNP) in a system that is not affected by defects and extrinsic carrier doping. We present\nresults for electric fields comparable to the experimental\nelectric displacement fields, 1.0V /nm < |E| < 5.0V /nm,\nfor room temperature and 4.5K. We use the LandauerB\u00fcttiker model, with a Hamiltonian generated through\nab initio density functional theory (DFT),17 coupled with\na non equilibrium Green's function formalism in a fully\nself-consistent procedure (NEGF-DFT)18 . To investigate\nthe effect of finite gates we implement a real-space Poisson solver with multigrid techniques19 .\nIn Fig. 1 we show a schematic representation of the\nbilayer dual-gated graphene nanotransistor considered in\nour calculations. The atomic geometry is composed of\nan AB stacked bilayer graphene (BG) with a scattering region up to 15 nm in length, sandwiched by left and\nright leads. A source-drain voltage (Vds ) is applied across\nthe system defining the current direction. The charge\ntransport properties were calculated with the NEGFDFT formalism, which uses the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian\nand overlap matrices computed with the siesta code20\nto self-consistently obtain the density matrix. In order to\ninvestigate a finite dual-gate system, we have done two\nmain modifications in the transampa code21 : (i) The\ninclusion of k points that are transversal to the trans-\n\n\f2\nport direction (k\u22a5 ), where for each k\u22a5 point in reciprocal\nspace we find a k\u22a5 -dependent density D(k\u22a5 )\u03bc\u03bd , by means\nof an integration of the lesser Green's function22,23 , and\ntransmittance T (E, k\u22a5 ), given by:24\nh\ni\nT (E, k\u22a5 ) = T r \u0393kL\u22a5 (E)Ga (E, k\u22a5 )\u0393kR\u22a5 (E)Gr (E, k\u22a5 ) .\n\n(1)\nGr(a) (E, k\u22a5 ) is the retarded (advanced) Green's function,\n\u22a5\nwhereas, \u0393kL(R)\n(E) are the terms that couple the leads to\nthe scattering region. The total density and transmittance are obtained upon an integration in the reciprocal\nspace with the following equations:\nZ\n1\n2\nD\u03bc\u03bd =\ndk\u22a5\nD(k\u22a5 )\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(2)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nT (E) =\n\n1\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nZ\n\n2\ndk\u22a5\nT (E, k\u22a5 ).\n\n(3)\n\nThese modifications allow the simulations of truly 2D\nsystems.\nOnce the density matrix convergence is\nachieved, the current is calculated within the LandauerB\u00fcttiker18 model in the non-interacting approach of\nMeir-Wingreen24 , where the current is given by:\nZ\n2e +\u221e\nT (E) [f (E \u2212 \u03bcL ) \u2212 f (E \u2212 \u03bcR )] dE, (4)\nI=\nh \u2212\u221e\nT (E) is given by (3), and f (E \u2212 \u03bcL/R ) are the FermiDirac distributions for the left(L)/right(R) leads. We\nused the local density approximation (LDA) for the\nexchange-correlation functional25 since it correctly describes the graphene interlayer distance without the inclusion of van der Waals corrections.26 (ii) The second modification was the inclusion of a real-space Poisson solver that allows non-periodic solutions for the\nHartree potential, necessary to set different values for\nthe top (Vtg ) and back (Vbg ) gate voltages with finite\ngate lengths. Therefore, we solve the Poisson equation in\na rectangular box, fixing the upper and lower boundary\nconditions, where the values of Vtg and Vbg are defined\nonly in a finite region of length Lgate (see Fig. 1). In our\ninvestigation we consider Lgate = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 nm,\nLscatt \u2248 15 nm, and a distance between the upper and\nlower boundaries of 20 \u00c5.\nWe guarantee the convergence of the transmittance using a double-\u03b6 basis, 300 Ry for the mesh cut-off and\n800 k\u22a5 points in the Brillouin zone with the MonkhorstPack scheme27 . We used a fully relaxed geometry with\na carbon-carbon distance of 1.428 \u00c5 and an interlayer\ndistance of 3.203 \u00c5. In the transport calculations, a tiny\nimaginary value of 10\u22126 Ry is added to the energy in\norder to calculate the retarded Green's function, and the\nelectron density was calculated with 60 energy points and\n5 poles to evaluate the integral of the lesser Green's function.\nThe flowing current Ids as a function of the sourcedrain voltage Vds is depicted in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) for\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) In (a) we present Ids \u00d7 Vds curves\nvarying \u2206V , for 300K and Lgate = 5.0nm. In (b) Ids \u00d7 Vds\ncurves varying Lgate , for 300K and \u2206V = 5.0V .\n\nroom temperature. In our simulations the gate voltages\nVbg and Vtg are tuned independently. In Fig. 2 all curves\nare for gate voltages with Vbg = \u2212Vtg , where the voltage difference is \u2206V = 2|Vbg |. In Fig. 2(a) we used\n\u2206V = 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 V , generating electric fields of\n0.5, 2.5, and 5.0 V /nm, comparable to experimental values. In all experiments12,16,28 , the electric displacement\nfield in the bilayer is estimated through the dielectric constant and thickness of the substrate dielectric layer, and\nfrom the effective potential caused by the carrier doping\ndue to the experimental conditions. In this Brief Report, the electric field was calculated via \u2206V /dbt , where\ndbt is the distance between the bottom and top gates.\nFor the configuration studied here, we verify a decrease\nof the current as \u2206V increases, suggesting the opening of a band gap that increases with \u2206V . Moreover,\nfor fixed gate length and gate voltages, the electric current has a linear dependence with the source-drain voltage, indicating an ohmic contact between the gated and\nnon-gated bilayer graphene. This behavior is also observed experimentally11\u201313,16 . From Fig. 2(a) we show\nthat we do not reach a zero electric current, even for\n\u2206V = 10.0 V . This result is in agreement with experimental works that fabricate dual-gate bilayer graphene\ndevices16 .\nIn Fig. 2(b) we fixed the Vbg = +2.5 V and Vtg =\n\u22122.5 V , and we present the dependence of the flowing\ncurrent with the gate length Lgate , for Lgate = 2 nm, up\nto 10 nm. We also observe a decrease of the current as\nLgate increases, indicating an increase of the region with\na gap. Again, the system does not reach a zero current\neven for Lgate = 10nm.\nSince we used open-boundary conditions, with the\nchemical potential fixed by the leads, we can independently vary Vbg and Vtg to control the carriers at the\nscattering region. The presence of the external electric\nfield causes a breakdown of the equivalence between the\ntwo layers. As a result, there is the opening of a band\n\n\f3\ngap and an inter-layer charge transfer. If there were no\ncharge transfer, the condition Vbg = \u2212Vtg would define\nthe charge neutrality point (CNP). However, the presence of a Hubbard-like correlation term29 , even at the\nmean-field level, coupled to this charge transfer, leads to\nan overall shift of the bands. As a result, the CNP occurs\nfor Vbg 6= \u2212Vtg , as shown in Fig. 3.\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) (a) Transmittance for Lgate = 2 nm\nwith Vtg = \u22122.0 V (solid black line), Vtg = \u22123.1 V (blue\ndashed-dotted line), Vtg = \u22124.0 V (dashed green line), and\nthe nongated case (orange dashed-double-dotted line). (b)\nTransmittance for Lgate = 10 nm with Vtg = \u22122.0 V (solid\nblack line), Vtg = \u22123.4 V (red dashed-dotted line) and Vtg =\n\u22124.0 V (dashed green line). Inset: Detail of the transmittance\nfor Lgate = 10 nm at CNP close to the Fermi energy region.\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Electronic transport characteristic of a\nbilayer graphene dual-gate FET, for Lgate = 5nm and Vbg =\n+2.5V . The current (blue squares) and net charge (black\ncircles) at (a) room temperature and at (b) T = 4.5K.\n\nThus, we performed calculations where we fixed the\nVbg at a certain value (+2.5 V) and varied the Vtg . The\ncalculated source-drain current and net carrier concentration in the bilayer, as a function of the top gate, is shown\nin Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) for a gate length Lgate = 5 nm,\nfor T = 300 and 4.5 K, respectively. The bias voltage\nwas fixed at Vds = 10 mV . The current minimum in\nboth curves corresponds to the charge neutrality point.\nFor a top gate voltage higher than \u2248 \u22123.4 V , electrons\nare being injected in the scattering region, whereas for\nVtg below this value the holes are being injected. As we\nhave no external doping, the chemical potential at the\ngated graphene is at the midgap. Moreover, since the\nconduction and valence bands are very similar, temperature will create intrinsic carriers but it will not change\nthe position of the chemical potential. Thus, there will be\nsome charge transfer from the graphene leads (electrons\nor holes) depending on the shift of the mid-gap position,\nat the gated graphene region, relative to the chemical potential of the leads. Also, in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) we plot\nthe carrier concentration per unit area. This presents a\nlinear behavior as a function of the variation of the gate\nvoltage, with zero net charge at the charge neutrality\npoint. This indicates a linear displacement of the bands\nwith the gate voltage. There is a notable decrease in the\ncurrent when the temperature is diminished from 300 to\n4.5 K. This is caused both by variations in the transmittance with temperature as well as by changes in the tail\nof the Fermi-Dirac distribution [see Eq. (4)]. For the case\npresented in Fig. 3, the current decreases by more than\nsix times. However, the net charge concentration is very\nsimilar in both temperatures, a result of the invariance\n\nof the mid-gap position with temperature, as discussed\nabove.\nFigure 4 shows the effect of the gate potential in the\ntransmittance for (a) Lgate = 2 nm and (b) Lgate =\n10 nm; at 300 K with a fixed back gate voltage of +2.5 V ,\nand varying Vtg . Under the same conditions, for larger\ngates the modifications on the transmittance are more\nexpressive in comparison to the smaller ones. For each\nVbg /Vtg configuration the gate potentials causes a low\ntransmittance region that is much more pronounced with\nLgate = 10 nm in comparisson with Lgate = 2 nm. However, the transmittance never goes to zero, as can be seen\non the inset in Fig. 4(b).\nIt is important to emphasize that in our calculations\nthe electric field is applied only in a finite portion of the\nscattering region through the dual-gate system. As a consequence, the inter-layer charge transfer caused by this\nelectric field occurs only in the gated region. In Fig. 5(a)\nwe present the charge induced at CNP, by a dual gate\nwith Lgate = 10 nm. In the bottom (top) layer there is\nan excess (lack) of electrons. In Fig. 5(b) we show the\ndensity of states projected on every four atoms (equivalent to the unitary cell) along its entire length, from\nthe left-hand (z = 0.0 nm) to the right-hand electrodes\n(z = 14.6 nm). Near to the leads (green lines) the projected density of states (PDOS) are similar to the PDOS\nof a non-gated pristine bilayer, as expected, whereas directly under the gated region (yellow line) the PDOS is\ncharacteristic of a bilayer with an applied perpendicular\nelectric field, where the two peaks located at approximately \u00b112 meV are associated with the presence of a\n\"mexican\" hat behavior of the bands. However, since the\ngate is spatially finite, even in the presence of an energy\nband gap there is a finite density of states present. This\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) (a) Difference between the non-gated\nand gated local charge density. As can be seen, there is a\ntransfer of electrons from the top to the botton layer (units\nof e/bohr 3 ). (b) Projected density of states every four atoms\n(equivalent to the unitary cell) along the z direction. The\nsystem considered had a Lgate of 10nm and was at the CNP.\n\nis due to the penetration of the wave function in this forbidden energy region. This results explains the absence\nof an energy gap for transport [e.g.. see Fig. 4(b).]\nTo understand further the persistent current on the\ndevice, we look at its behavior as a function of the gate\nlength. In Fig. 6, we fix \u2206V = 5 V and Vds = 10 mV ,\nand vary Lgate for 300 and 4.5 K. We obtain an exponential dependence between the current and the gate\nlength, characteristic of a tunneling regime. The tunneling current persists even for the largest gate length,\nLgate = 10nm. A significant increase of the current\nwith temperature can be observed; this is largely caused\nby the broadening of the transport window via the\n[f (E \u2212 \u03bcL ) \u2212 f (E \u2212 \u03bcR )] term. At the low-bias regime,\nthe tail of the Fermi-Dirac function mostly controls the\ncurrent, since there is a small density of states (and hence\na small number of transport channels) around the Fermi\nlevel in the electrodes. It is important to remind that in\nour ab initio calculations we retain all the intrinsic properties of the device, without the presence of defects, im-\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\npadilha@if.usp.br\nmplima@if.usp.br\najrsilva@if.usp.br\nfazzio@if.usp.br\nF.

Rev.\n\npurity carrier doping, or a substrate dielectric material.\nTherefore, the off-current in our simulations is explained\nby tunneling across the gated region, and strongly depends on the transport energy window caused by the\nFermi-Dirac distribution.\nFor our nanodevice we estimated the on/off current ratio, (Ion /Iof f ) at room temperature, (300 K), and low\ntemperature, (4.5 K). The on current is calculated for\nthe non-gated bilayer graphene with a source-drain voltage of 10 mV and the off currents are all defined at\nthe charge neutrality point, with a back gate voltage of\n+2.5 V and the source-drain voltage fixed at 10 mV .\nThe largest Ion /Iof f happens at Lgate = 10 nm, which\nis around 100 at room temperature, and 1250 at 4.5 K.\nIn summary, using ab initio calculations, we study the\nelectronic transport properties of a dual-gated bilayer\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Ids \u00d7 Lgate curves for \u2206V = 5.0V and\nVds = 10mV , for 300K and 4.5K.

Under the action of an external\nelectric field, we show that, even for gate lengths up to\n100 \u00c5 and for room temperature and 4.5 K, a non-zero\ncurrent is exhibited. The results can be explained by\nthe presence of a tunneling regime due the remanescent\nstates in the gated region.\nWe would like to thank E. Mucciolo for comments and\ndiscussions.
