Introduction\nWe know that concave functions play major roles in many branches of mathematics for instance probability theory ([4], [6], [10], say), interpolation theory (cf.\n[13], say), weighted norm inequalities (cf. [5], say), and functions spaces (cf. [12],\nsay), as well as in many other branches of sciences. In the line of [4], [6] and [10],\nthe present author also obtained in martingale theory some results in connection\nwith certain collective properties or behaviors of concave Young-functions (cf. [1],\n[2]). The study presented in [3] was mainly motivated by the question why strictly\nconcave functions possess so many properties, worth to be characterized using appropriate tools that await to be discovered.\nWe say that a function \u03a6 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e) belongs to the set Yconc (and\nis referred to as a concave Young-function) if and only if it admits the integral\nrepresentation\nZ x\n(1.1)\n\u03a6 (x) =\n\u03c6 (t) dt,\n0\n\n(where \u03c6 : (0, \u221e) \u2192 (0, \u221e) is a right-continuous and decreasing function such that\nit is integrable on every finite interval (0, x)) and \u03a6 (\u221e) = \u221e. It is worth to note\nthat every function in Yconc is strictly concave.\nWe will remind some results obtained so far in [3].\nWe shall say that a concave Young-function\n\u03a6 satisfies the density-level property\nR\u221e\nif A\u03a6 (\u221e) < \u221e, where A\u03a6 (\u221e) := 1 \u03c6(t)\ndt.\nAll the concave Young-functions\nt\npossessing the density-level property will be grouped in a set A.\nDate: March 24th, 2006.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

AGBEKO\n\nIn Theorems 1 and 2 (cf. [3]), we showed that the composition of any two\nconcave Young-functions satisfies the density-level property if and only if at least\none of them satisfies it. These two theorems show that concave Young-functions\nwith the density-level property behave like left and right ideal with respect to the\ncomposition operation.\nWe also proved ([3], Lemma 5, page 12) that if \u03a6 \u2208 Yconc , then there are constants\nC\u03a6 > 0 and B\u03a6 \u2265 0 such that\nZ \u221e\n\u03a6 (t)\ndt \u2264 C\u03a6 + A\u03a6 (\u221e) .\nA\u03a6 (\u221e) \u2212 B\u03a6 \u2264\n(t\n+ 1)2\n0\nThis led us to the idea to search for a Lebesgue measure (described here below) with\nrespect to which every concave Young-function turns out to be square integrable\n([3], Lemma 6, page 13), i.e. Yconc \u2282 L2 := L2 ([0, \u221e) , M, \u03bc), where M is a\n\u03c3-algebra (of [0, \u221e)) containing the\n\u0010 Borel sets\u0011and \u03bc : M \u2192 [0, \u221e) is a Lebesgue\n1\n1\nmeasure defined by \u03bc ([0, x)) = 3 1 \u2212 (x+1)\nfor all x \u2208 [0, \u221e).

Bijections between subsets of Yconc\nWe first anticipate that there are as many elements in each of the sets A and\nYconc \\A as there exist in Yconc , showing how broad the set of concave Youngfunctions possessing the density-level property and its complement really are.\nTheorem 1. The sets A, Yconc and Yconc \\A are pairwise equinumerous.\n\n\fCOLLECTIVE PROPERTIES OF\n\nCONCAVE YOUNG-FUNCTIONS\n\n3\n\nProof. We first show that there is a bijection between A and Yconc . In fact, since\nA is a proper subset of Yconc there is an injection from A to Yconc , as a matter of\nfact, the identity mapping from A into Yconc will do. Fix any number \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1)\nand define the mapping S\u03b1 : Yconc \u2192 A by S\u03b1 (\u03a6) = \u03a6\u03b1 . We point out that this\nmapping exists in virtue of Theorem 2 in [3]. It is not hard to see that S\u03b1 is an\ninjection. Then the Schr\u00f6der-Bernstein theorem entails that there exists a bijection\nbetween A and Yconc . To complete the proof it is enough to show that there is a\nbijection between A and Yconc \\A. In fact, fix arbitrarily some \u03a6 \u2208 Yconc \\A and\ndefine the function h\u03a6 : A \u2192 Yconc \\A by h\u03a6 (\u2206) = \u2206 + \u03a6. Obviously, h\u03a6 is an\ninjection. Now, fix any \u2206 \u2208 A and define the function f\u2206 : Yconc \\A \u2192 A by\nf\u2206 (\u03a6) = \u2206 \u25e6 \u03a6. We point out that this function always exists due to Theorem 2 in\n[3]. It is not difficult to show that f\u2206 is an injection if we take into account that \u2206\nis an invertible function. Consequently, the Schr\u00f6der-Bernstein theorem guarantees\nthe existence of a bijection between A and Yconc \\A. Therefore, we can conclude\non the validity of the argument.\n\u0003\nWrite Ab := {\u03a6 \u2208 A : \u03a6 (b) = b} and Yb := {\u03a6 \u2208 Yconc : \u03a6 (b) = b} for every\nnumber b \u2208 (0, \u221e).\nLet us denote by Z := {Ab : b \u2208 (0, \u221e)} and Z \u2217 := {Yb : b \u2208 (0, \u221e)}.\nIt is obvious that Ab \u2282 Yb for every number b \u2208 (0, \u221e) and Z \u2229 Z \u2217 = \u2205.\no\nn\nb\u03a6\n: \u03a6 \u2208 A and\nLemma 1. For every number b \u2208 (0, \u221e) the identities Ab = \u03a6(b)\no\nn\nb\u03a6\n: \u03a6 \u2208 Yconc hold true.\nYb = \u03a6(b)\n\nb\u03a8\nProof. Pick any function \u03a8 \u2208 Ab . Then \u03a8 \u2208 A and \u03a8 (b) = b, so that \u03a8 = \u03a8(b)\n\u2208\no\nn\no\nn\nb\u03a6\nb\u03a6\n\u03a6(b) : \u03a6 \u2208 A , i.e. Ab \u2282\n\u03a6(b) : \u03a6 \u2208 A . To show the reverse inclusion consider\nn\no\nb\u03a6\nany function \u03a8 \u2208 \u03a6(b)\n: \u03a6 \u2208 A . Then necessarily there must exist some \u03a6 \u2208 A\nb\u03a6\nsuch that \u03a8 = \u03a6(b)\n. It is obvious that \u03a8 \u2208 A and \u03a8 (b) = b, i.e. \u03a8 \u2208 Ab .

Hence, we can easily check\nthat (Z, \u0016) and (Z \u2217 , \u0016) are chains, i.e. they are totally ordered sets.\nTheorem 5. The functions f1 : (0, \u221e) \u2192 Z and f2 : (0, \u221e) \u2192 Z \u2217 , defined\nrespectively by f1 (p) = Ap and f2 (p) = Yp , are order preserving bijections.\nProof. We show that the function f1 : (0, \u221e) \u2192 Z, f1 (p) = Ap , is an order\npreserving bijection. In fact, it is not hard to see via Remark 1 that f1 is an\ninjection. Now pick any element C \u2208 Z. Obviously, there must exist some number\np \u2208 (0, \u221e) such that C = Ap = f1 (p), i.e. f1 is a surjection. Consequently, f1 is a\nbijection. To end the proof of this part we simply point out that the bijection f1\n\n\f8\n\nN. K. AGBEKO\n\nis order preserving in virtue of Remark ??. Finally, we note that we can similarly\nprove that f2 is also an order preserving bijection.\n\u0003\nSince the sets (Z, \u0016) and (Z \u2217 , \u0016) are chains it is natural to look for a metric on\nthem. We shall do this in the following two results. But before that let us recall\nthe definitions of some distances known in the literature (cf. [8], say). If \u03a6 \u2208 Yconc\nis any function and F , G \u2282 Yconc are arbitrary non-empty subsets, then we define\nthe distance from the point \u03a6 to the set G by \u03c1 (\u03a6, G) := inf {d (\u03a6, \u03a8) : \u03a8 \u2208 G} =\ninf {d (\u03a8, \u03a6) : \u03a8 \u2208 G} = \u03c1 (G, \u03a6) and the distance between the two sets F and G by\ndist (F , G) := sup {inf {d (\u03a6, \u03a8) : \u03a8 \u2208 G} : \u03a6 \u2208 F }\n\n= sup {inf {d (\u03a6, \u03a8) : \u03a6 \u2208 F } : \u03a8 \u2208 G} .\n\nFirst we find sufficient conditions for which the distance from a point to a subset\n(both in Yconc ) should be positive, in order to guarantee that the distance between\ntwo sets in Yconc have sense.\nLemma 3. Let b1 and b2 \u2208 (0, \u221e) be two arbitrary distinct numbers. Then\n\u03c1 (Yb1 , \u03a62 ) > 0 and \u03c1 (Ab1 , \u03a62 ) > 0 whenever \u03a62 \u2208 Yb2 .\nProof. It is enough to show that \u03c1 (Ab1 , \u03a62 ) > 0 whenever \u03a62 \u2208 Yb2 . In fact, suppose in the contrary that \u03c1 (Ab1 , \u03a62 ) = 0 for some \u03a62 \u2208 Yb2 . Then there can be extracted some sequence (\u2206n ) \u2282 Ab1 such that d (\u2206n , \u03a62 ) > d (\u2206n+1 , \u03a62 ), n \u2208 N, and\nlimn\u2192\u221e d (\u2206n , \u03a62 ) = \u03c1 (Ab1 , \u03a62 ) = 0. We point out that this can be done because\n2\nof the definition of the infimum. For each n \u2208 N let us set \u0393n := inf k\u2265n (\u2206k \u2212 \u03a62 ) .\nClearly, (\u0393n ) is a non-decreasing\n\u0010R sequence of\u0011 measurable functions with its corresponding sequence of integrals [0, \u221e) \u0393n d\u03bc been bounded above by Cb1 + Cb2 <\n\u221e, see Remark 3. Then by the Beppo Levi's Theorem we can derive that sequenceR(\u0393n ) converges almostR everywhere to some integrable measurable function\n\u0393 and [0, \u221e) \u0393d\u03bc = limn\u2192\u221e [0, \u221e) \u0393n d\u03bc \u2264 limn\u2192\u221e d (\u2206n , \u03a62 ) = 0, meaning that\nlimn\u2192\u221e inf k\u2265n \u2206k = \u03a62 almost everywhere. There are two cases to be clarified.\nFirst assume that b1 < b2 . Obviously, \u03bc ((b1 , b2 )) > 0, so that there must be at\nleast one point x0 \u2208 (b1 , b2 ) such that limn\u2192\u221e inf k\u2265n \u2206k (x0 ) = \u03a62 (x0 ). But since\nb1 < b2 the concave property implies that the graph of \u03a62 (resp. the graph of each\nfunction inf k\u2265n \u2206k ) lies above (resp. below) the graph of the line of equation y = x\nin the interval (b1 , b2 ). Consequently, limn\u2192\u221e inf k\u2265n \u2206k (x0 ) \u2264 x0 < \u03a62 (x0 ).\nThis, however, is absurd since limn\u2192\u221e inf k\u2265n \u2206k (x0 ) = \u03a62 (x0 ). Considering the\nsecond case when b1 > b2 we can similarly get into a contradiction. Therefore, the\nstatement is valid.\n\u0003\nLemma 4. Let b and c \u2208 (0, \u221e) be two arbitrary numbers. Then the following\nassertions are equivalent:\n(1) The equality b = c holds.\n(2) The sets Yb and Yc are equal.\n(3) The equality dist (Yb , Yc ) = 0 holds.\nProof. We first note that the chain of implications (1) \u2192 (2) \u2192 (3) is obviously\ntrue. Thus we need only show the conditional (3) \u2192 (1). In fact, assume that\ndist (Yb , Yc ) = 0 but b 6= c. Then \u03c1 (Yb , \u2206) = 0 for all \u2206 \u2208 Yc . Nevertheless, this\ncontradicts Lemma 3, since b 6= c. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\u0003\nWe can similarly prove that:\n\n\fCOLLECTIVE PROPERTIES OF\n\nCONCAVE YOUNG-FUNCTIONS\n\n9\n\nLemma 5. Let b and c \u2208 (0, \u221e) be two arbitrary numbers. Then the following\nassertions are equivalent :\n(1) The equality b = c holds.\n(2) The sets Ab and Ac are equal.\n(3) The equality dist (Ab , Ac ) = 0 holds.\nTheorem 6. Let b and c \u2208 (0, \u221e) be two arbitrary numbers. Then the quantities\ndist (Ab , Ac ) and dist (Yb , Yc ) define metrics on Z and Z \u2217 respectively. Hence, the\ncouples (Z, dist) and (Z \u2217 , dist) are metric spaces.\nProof. We need only show that dist (Yb , Yc ) is a metric on the set Z \u2217 , because the\nother case can be similarly proved. In fact, we first point out that the condition\ndist (Yb , Yc ) \u2265 0 is obvious and, by Lemma 4 the equality holds if and only if\nYb = Yc . We also note that the symmetry property trivially holds true. We are\nnow left with the proof of the triangle inequality. In fact, let Ybj \u2208 Z \u2217 and \u03a6j \u2208 Ybj\n(j \u2208 {1, 2, 3}) be arbitrary. Then by Proposition 5 (cf. [3], page 15) we have that\nd (\u03a61 , \u03a63 ) \u2264 d (\u03a61 , \u03a62 ) + d (\u03a62 , \u03a63 ). Next, by taking the infimum over \u03a63 \u2208 Yb3 it\nfollows that\n\u03c1 (\u03a61 , Yb3 ) \u2264 d (\u03a61 , \u03a62 ) + \u03c1 (\u03a62 , Yb3 ) \u2264 d (\u03a61 , \u03a62 ) + dist (Yb2 , Yb3 ) ,\ni.e. \u03c1 (\u03a61 , Yb3 ) \u2264 d (\u03a61 , \u03a62 ) + dist (Yb2 , Yb3 ). Finally, taking the infimum over \u03a62 \u2208\nYb2 yields \u03c1 (\u03a61 , Yb3 ) \u2264 \u03c1 (\u03a61 , Yb2 ) + dist (Yb2 , Yb3 ), so that\ndist (Yb1 , Yb3 ) \u2264 dist (Yb1 , Yb2 ) + dist (Yb2 , Yb3 ) .\nThis was to be proven.\n\n\u0003\n\nBy the law of trichotomy it is not hard to see that (Z, \u0016) and (Z \u2217 , \u0016) are lattices.\nHere too, the supremum and infimum binary operations on the lattices (Z, \u0016) and\n(Z \u2217 , \u0016) will be denoted by the usual symbols \u2228 and \u2227 respectively. We also point\nout that (Z, \u0016) and (Z \u2217 , \u0016) are infinite graphs. Between two vertices Ab1 , Ab2 \u2208 Z\nwe can define the edge in two different ways: one by e = dist (Ab1 , Ab2 ) \u2208 (0, \u221e)\nand the other one by Ae \u2208 Z where e = dist (Ab1 , Ab2 ). These two edges can apply\nfor the vertices of Z \u2217 as well.\n(n)\n\n4. Dense subsets in Yb\n\nTheorem 7. Let b \u2208 (0, \u221e) be an arbitrary number. Then Ab is a dense set in\nYb .\nProof. Fix arbitrarily any function \u03a8 \u2208 Yb . Then there is some \u03a6 \u2208 Yconc such\n1\u22121/(n+1)\nb\u03a6\nthat \u03a8 = \u03a6(b)\n(by Lemma 1). Define \u03a8n (x) = b(\u03a6(x))\n, for all x \u2208 [0, \u221e)\n(\u03a6(b))1\u22121/(n+1)\n\nand n \u2208 N. As we know from Theorem 2 (cf. [3], page 6) function \u03a61\u22121/(n+1) \u2208 A\nfor all \u03a6 \u2208 Yconc , n \u2208 N. Then (\u03a8n ) \u2282 A (via Lemma 1, [3], page 5). Hence,\n(\u03a8n ) \u2282 Ab , since \u03a8n (b) = b for all n \u2208 N. We can easily show that (\u03a8n ) converges\npointwise to \u03a8. By Remark 4 it ensues that \u03a8 (x) \u2264 hb (x) and \u03a8n (x) \u2264 hb (x) for\nall x \u2208 [0, \u221e) and n \u2208 N, where hb (x) = x + b, x \u2208 [0, \u221e). We know via Remark\n3 that function hb is square integrable. Then by applying twice the Dominated\nConvergence Theorem one can verify that\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nlim\n\u03a82n d\u03bc =\n\u03a82 d\u03bc and lim\n\u03a8n \u03a8d\u03bc =\n\u03a82 d\u03bc,\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n[0, \u221e)\n\n[0, \u221e)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n[0, \u221e)\n\n[0, \u221e)\n\n\f10\n\nN.

This was to be proven.\n\u0003\n(n)\n\nTheorem 8. Fix any pair of numbers n \u2208 N\\ {1} and b \u2208 (0, \u221e). Then Ab\n(n)\ndense in Yb .\n(n)\n\nis\n\nCO(n)\n\nProof. Pick arbitrarily some \u2206 \u2208 Yb . Since obviously Yb\nis a proper subset\n(n)\nof Yb , we will have two cases to take into consideration. First assume that \u2206 \u2208\nCO(n)\nYb\n. This means that there can be found a counting number k \u2265 n and a finite\n(1)\nsequence \u03a61 , . . . , \u03a6k \u2208 Yb = Yb such that \u2206 = \u03a61 \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03a6k . Fix any integer\n\u0001j/(j+1)\nj \u2208 N and write \u2206j = \u03a8j \u25e6 \u2206, where \u03a8j (x) = b1/j x\n, x \u2208 [0, \u221e). Clearly,\n(1)\n\u03a8j \u2208 Ab for all j \u2208 N. Then applying Theorem 2 in [3] and via the structure of\nCO(n)\nCO(n)\nset Ab\n, we can deduce that \u2206j \u2208 Ab\nfor all j \u2208 N. It is not difficult to see\nthat sequence (\u2206j ) converge pointwise to \u2206. By Remark 4 we observe that \u2206 \u2264 hb ,\n2\n\u2206j \u2264 hb and hence, \u2206\u2206j \u2264 (hb ) on [0, \u221e). Then recalling twice the Dominated\nConvergence Theorem we can easily verify that\nZ\nZ\nZ\n2\nlim\n\u22062 d\u03bc = lim\n(\u2206j ) d\u03bc =\n\u2206\u2206j d\u03bc.\nj\u2192\u221e\n\n[0, \u221e)\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\n[0, \u221e)\n\n[0, \u221e)\n\nConsequently, limj\u2192\u221e d (\u2206, \u2206j ) = 0. In the second case we can suppose that\n(n)\nCO(n)\n\u2206 \u2208 Yb \\Yb\n. Then without loss of generality we may choose \u03a61 , . . . , \u03a6k \u2208\nCO(n)\nYb\n, whose graphs are pairwise distinct, and some finite sequence (t1 , . . . tk ) \u2208\nPk\nH[0, 1] with (t1 , . . . tk ) \u2282 (0, 1) such that \u2206 =\ni=1 ti \u03a6i . Consider \u2206j =\n\u0001\nPk\nj/(j+1)\n1/j\nx\n, x \u2208 [0, \u221e), j \u2208 N. Clearly,\ni=1 ti (\u03a8j \u25e6 \u03a6i ), where \u03a8j (x) = b\n(n)\nCO(n)\non the one hand we have that (\u2206j ) \u2282 Ab because (\u03a8j \u25e6 \u03a6i ) \u2282 Ab\nfor every\nfixed index i \u2208 {1, . . . k} and on the other hand limj\u2192\u221e d (\u03a6i , \u03a8j \u25e6 \u03a6i ) = 0, i \u2208\n{1, . . . k}, because of the first part of this proof. Consequently, by the Minkowski\nPk\ninequality we can observe that limj\u2192\u221e d (\u2206, \u2206j ) \u2264 i=1 ti limj\u2192\u221e d (\u03a6i , \u03a8j \u25e6 \u03a6i ) =\n0. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\n5. Some criterium on the Lp -norm\nThe result here below is worth being mentioned, which is an answer to the second\nopen problem in [3].\nTheorem 9. Let \u03a6 \u2208 Yconc be arbitrary. Then the following assertions are equivalent.\n(1) limt\u2192\u221e \u03a6(t)\nt = limt\u2192\u221e \u03c6 (t) \u2208 (0, \u221e).\n(2) There is some constant c \u2208 [1, \u221e) such that c\u03a6 > \u03a6id on (0, \u221e).\n(3) There is some constant c \u2208 [1, \u221e) and some strictly concave function \u2206 :\n[0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e), differentiable on (0, \u221e) and vanishing at the origin such that\nc\u03a6 = \u03a6id + \u2206 on [0, \u221e).\nProof. We first prove the conditional (1)\u2192(2). In fact, assume that limt\u2192\u221e \u03a6(t)\nt \u2208\n(0, \u221e) but in the contrary for every counting number k \u2208 N there is some xk \u2208\nk)\n\u2264 limk\u2192\u221e k \u22121 = 0 which\n(0, \u221e) for which k\u03a6 (xk ) \u2264 xk .

Next we show the impliis absurd since lim sup \u03a6(x\nxk\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\ncation (2)\u2192(3). In fact, assume that there is some constant c \u2208 [1, \u221e) such that\nc\u03a6 > \u03a6id on (0, \u221e) and write \u2206 := c\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6id . Clearly, \u2206 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e) is a\nfunction such that \u2206 (0) = 0 and \u2206 is positive on (0, \u221e). We also note that \u2206\nis differentiable on (0, \u221e). Writing \u03b4 for the derivative of \u2206, we can observe that\n\u03b4 = c\u03c6 \u2212 1 on (0, \u221e). To show that \u2206 is strictly concave it is enough if we prove\nthat\n(y \u2212 x) \u03b4 (y \u2212 0) < \u2206 (y) \u2212 \u2206 (x) < (y \u2212 x) \u03b4 (x + 0) = (y \u2212 x) \u03b4 (x)\n\nfor all x, y \u2208 (0, \u221e) with x < y (where, \u03b4 (t \u2212 0) respectively is the left derivative\nand \u03b4 (t + 0) the right derivative of \u2206 at point t). In fact, fix arbitrarily two numbers\nx, y \u2208 (0, \u221e) such that x < y. But since \u03a6 is strictly concave we have that\n(y \u2212 x) \u03c6 (y \u2212 0) < \u03a6 (y) \u2212 \u03a6 (x) < (y \u2212 x) \u03c6 (x + 0) = (y \u2212 x) \u03c6 (x)\n\nwhich easily leads to\n\nc\u03c6 (y \u2212 0) <\nHence,\n\nc\u03a6 (y) \u2212 c\u03a6 (x)\n< c\u03c6 (x + 0) = c\u03c6 (x) .\ny\u2212x\n\nc\u03c6 (y \u2212 0) \u2212 1 <\ni.e.\n\nc\u03a6 (y) \u2212 c\u03a6 (x)\n\u2212 1 < c\u03c6 (x) \u2212 1,\ny\u2212x\n\n(y \u2212 x) \u03b4 (y \u2212 0) < \u2206 (y) \u2212 \u2206 (x) < (y \u2212 x) \u03b4 (x) .\nThis ends the proof of the implication (2)\u2192(3). In the last step, we just point out\nthat the conditional (3)\u2192(1) is obvious. Therefore, we can conclude on the validity\nof the argument.\n\u0003\no\nn\nDenote Y]\n\u03a6 \u2208 Yconc : limt\u2192\u221e \u03a6(t)\nconc :=\nt > 0 .

Throughout the proof \u03b5 \u2208 [0, \u221e) will be any fixed number. We first note\nthat the assertion is trivial when (|f | = \u221e) 6= \u2205. We shall then prove it when\n(|f | < \u221e) 6= \u2205. Pick some \u2206 \u2208 Y]\nconc and c \u2208 T\u2206 such that c\u2206 > \u03a6id on\n\u0001 (0, \u221e). It\nis not hard to see that (|f | \u2265 \u03b5) = (\u2206 \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u2206 (\u03b5)) \u2282 \u2206 \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u03b5c\u22121 and thus\n\u0001\n\u03bb (|f | \u2265 \u03b5) = \u03bb (\u2206 \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u2206 (\u03b5)) \u2264 \u03bb \u2206 \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u03b5c\u22121 .\nConsequently,\n\no\nn \b\n\u0001\n\u03bb (|f | \u2265 \u03b5) \u2264 inf inf \u03bb \u2206 \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u03b5c\u22121 : c \u2208 T\u2206 : \u2206 \u2208 Y]\nconc .\n\nTo prove the converse statement, we need show that\no\nn \b\n\u0001\n\u03bb (|f | \u2265 \u03b5) \u2265 inf inf \u03bb \u2206 \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u03b5c\u22121 : c \u2208 T\u2206 : \u2206 \u2208 Y]\nconc .\n\u0001\nIn fact, for any n \u2208 N set \u2206n = \u03a6id + n\u22121 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03a6id . It is not difficult to see that\n\u2206n \u2208 Yconc and \u2206n > \u03a6id on (0, \u221e), n \u2208 N. This means that (\u2206n ) \u2282 Y]\nconc and\nmoreover, 1 \u2208 T\u2206n , n \u2208 N. Consequently,\no\nn \b\n\u0001\ninf inf \u03bb \u2206 \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u03b5c\u22121 : c \u2208 T\u2206 : \u2206 \u2208 Y]\nconc \u2264 \u03bb (\u2206n \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u03b5)\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n= \u03bb |f | + n\u22121 1 \u2212 e\u2212|f | \u2265 \u03b5 .\nHowever, as (\u2206n ) is a decreasing sequence it is obvious that (\u2206n+1 \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u03b5) \u2282\n(\u2206n \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u03b5), n \u2208 N. Thus having passed to the limit we can observe that\no\nn \b\n\u0001\ninf inf \u03bb \u2206 \u25e6 |f | \u2265 \u03b5c\u22121 : c \u2208 T\u2206 : \u2206 \u2208 Y]\nconc \u2264 \u03bb (|f | \u2265 \u03b5) .\nTherefore, the proof is a valid argument.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fCOLLECTIVE PROPERTIES OF\n\nCONCAVE YOUNG-FUNCTIONS\n\n13\n\nTheorem 12. Let f \u2208 Lp (\u03a9, F , \u03bb), p \u2265 1, where (\u03a9, F , \u03bb) is any given measure\nspace.

Pick arbitrarily some \u2206 \u2208 Y]\nconc and c \u2208 T\u2206 such that c\u2206 > \u03a6id on (0, \u221e).\nClearly, c k\u2206 \u25e6 |f |kLp \u2265 kf kLp . We can then easily observe that\nn\no\ninf inf {c k\u2206 \u25e6 |f |kLp : c \u2208 T\u2206 } : \u2206 \u2208 Y]\nconc \u2265 kf kLp .\n\n]\nTo prove the converse of this\n\u0001 inequality consider the sequence (\u2206n ) \u2282 Yconc , where\n\u2206n = \u03a6id + n\u22121 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03a6id > \u03a6id on (0, \u221e), n \u2208 N. Then as 1 \u2208 T\u2206n , n \u2208 N, we\nhave\nn\no\ninf inf {c k\u2206 \u25e6 |f |kLp : c \u2208 T\u2206 } : \u2206 \u2208 Y]\nconc \u2264 k\u2206n \u25e6 |f |kLp .\n\nSince (\u2206n ) is a decreasing sequence it ensues that (\u2206n \u25e6 |f |) is also a decreasing\nsequence which tends to |f |. As every member of sequence (\u2206n \u25e6 |f |) is dominated\nby \u22061 \u25e6 |f | \u2208 Lp , then by applying the Dominated Convergence Theorem it will\nentail that\no\nn\ninf inf {c k\u2206 \u25e6 |f |kLp : c \u2208 T\u2206 } : \u2206 \u2208 Y]\nconc \u2264 kf kLp .\nThis completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollaryn 3.

Fix any number x \u2208 R and let f \u2208 Lp (\u03a9, F , \u03bb) be the constant function\ndefined by f \u2261 h (x) on \u03a9.
