The N -th member in\nthe hierarchy is an N -component system defined on an elementary plaquette in the 2-dimensional\nlattice. The system is multidimensionally consistent and a Lagrangian which respects this feature,\ni.e., which has the desirable closure property, is obtained.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat we now call the lattice modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation appeared, up to a\npoint-transformation, as early as 1894 in the work of Bianchi [4] as the permutability condition for\nB\u00e4cklund transformations of the sine-Gordon equation. It appeared again as an integrable partial\ndifference equation via Hirota's method in [10], and it was derived via the direct linearization\nscheme in [17].\nTo describe the lattice MKdV in the modern setting, let v = v(l, m) be the dependent variable\ndepending on position (l, m) in a 2-dimensional lattice, where l and m shift by integer values,\nand let p, q be parameters associated with the l, m-lattice directions respectively. Then the lattice\nMKdV equation reads\n\u02c6 = q(v\u1e7d \u2212 v\u0302 \u1e7d),\n\u02c6\np(vv\u0302 \u2212 \u1e7d \u1e7d)\n(1)\nwhere \" \u0303\" denotes a shift in the l-direction, and \"\u02c6\" denotes a shift in the m-direction.\nA generalized direct linearization scheme proposed in [19] led to a higher order analogue of the\nlattice MKdV equation, which can be identified as a lattice version of the modified Boussinesq\n(MBSQ) equation of [21]. This is a scalar equation on a stencil of 9 lattice points, given by\n\u0012\n\np2 \u1e7d\u02c6 \u2212 q 2 v\u0302\u02c6\npv\u0302\u02c6 \u2212 q \u1e7d\u02c6\n\n\u0013\u02c6 \u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n \u0303\n \u0303\n\u02c6\n\u1e7d\u02c6\nv\n\u1e7d\u02c6\np \u1e7d \u0303 \u2212 q 2 \u1e7d\u02c6 \u1e7d\u02c6\nv\n\u1e7d\u02c6\n\u2212q\n.\n\u2212\n=p\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nv\u0302\n\u1e7d\nv\u0302\np\u1e7d\u02c6 \u2212 q \u1e7d \u0303 \u1e7d\n \u0303\n \u0303\n\u1e7d\u02c6\n\u1e7d\u02c6\n\n(2)\n\nA more convenient form of this equation appeared in [20], specifically a coupled system of equations\nin two dependent variables v, w defined on an elementary plaquette:\npv\u0302 \u2212 q\u1e7d\npw\u0303 \u2212 q \u0175\np\u1e7d\u0175 \u2212 qv\u0302 w\u0303\n.\n=\n=\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nw\nv w\u0303\n\u1e7d\n\n(3)\n\nThe scalar equation (2) can be derived from (3) by eliminating one or other of the variables.\nAs shown in [20], in either form this is a discrete analogue of the potential modified Boussinesq\nequation [21]. Symmetries and conservation laws for the two-component form of the equation were\nderived in [22].\nThe lattice Gel'fand-Dikii (GD) hierarchy, that is the system given in [19] which goes to the\ncontinuous GD hierarchy under suitable limits1 , is a multicomponent system whose first members\n1 In the 1970s members of the Russian school, including Gel'fand and Dikii, studied higher order spectral problems\ngeneralizing aspects of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (c.f. e.g. [7, 16]); hence these types of systems have been referred\nto as Gel'fand-Dikii hierarchies.\n\n1\n\n\fare the lattice potential KdV equation and a lattice version of the Boussinesq equation. A lattice\n'modified' GD hierarchy was also proposed in the Appendix of [19], the first two members of which,\n(1) and (2), were given explicitly, but its higher members were left implicit due to the difficulty of\nwriting corresponding scalar equations in explicit form on increasing stencil size.\nIn this paper we study a hierarchy of systems whose first two members are (1) and (3). Different\nto the direct linearization approach of [19] it will be obtained by a reduction procedure from the\ndiscrete Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation of Hirota [9], and in fact the precise relationship\nbetween the system studied here and those of [19] is not yet known beyond the first two cases. Like\nthe first cases (1) and (3), each system is defined on an elementary plaquette of the 2-dimensional\nlattice (i.e., it is a quad equation); in particular each is consistent in multidimensions and possesses\na Lax representation. Our main objectives are to present the derivation of this hierarchy as well\nas a Lagrangian formulation that respects its consistency property.\nThe new kind of variational principle for multidimensionally consistent systems proposed in\n[13] relies on a closure property of the associated Lagrangian, allowing it to be interpreted as a\nclosed form. A Lagrangian with this property was given in [15] for the generic member of the\nlattice GD hierarchy. We give here a Lagrangian for the generic member of the hierarchy in this\npaper, for which there is a clear connection to that of the discrete bilinear KP equation, whose\nLagrangian was given in [14].\nIn Section 2 we derive the N -component lattice system, give the Lax pair, describe its multidimensional consistency and give some important symmetries. In Section 3 we present the Lagrangian structure, and in Section 4 we demonstrate that this Lagrangian obeys a closure relation\non solutions of the system. Section 5 contains some additional remarks.\n\n2\n\nThe system\n\nIt was observed in [2] that the one-variable and two-variable equations (1) and (3) can be obtained\nby a natural reduction procedure from the discrete KP equation of Hirota [9]. Generalization of\nthis reduction procedure then led to a quadrilateral lattice equation in N variables v1 , . . . , vN that\ncan be written as\npv\u0302n\u22121 \u1e7dn \u2212 q\u1e7dn\u22121 v\u0302n\npv\u0302n \u1e7dn+1 \u2212 q\u1e7dn v\u0302n+1\n=\n,\n\u1e7d\u02c6n\u22121 vn\n\u1e7d\u02c6n vn+1\n\nn \u2208 {1, . . . , N },\n\n(4)\n\nwhere by convention2 v0 = vN+1 = 1. This system, which contains (1) and (3) as cases N = 1 and\nN = 2, is the main object studied in the present paper.\n\n2.1\n\nReduction from Hirota's discrete KP\n\nWe begin by giving the reduction procedure from which (4) may be obtained. The starting point\nis the Hirota discrete KP equation [9]\n\u03c4\u0304 \u03c4\u0303\u02c6 = p\u03c4\u0302 \u03c4\u0304 \u0303 \u2212 q\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4\u0304\u02c6,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = \u03c4 (l, m, n), \u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4 (l + 1, m, n), \u03c4\u0302 = \u03c4 (l, m + 1, n), \u03c4\u0304 = \u03c4 (l, m, n + 1) etc. are values\nof the dependent variable \u03c4 as a function of independent variables l, m, n \u2208 Z. In this equation\np, q \u2208 C\\{0} are parameters, they are often taken equal to 1, which up to a non-autonomous change\nof variables is without loss of generality. Such change of variables will however not be possible after\nthe reduction procedure. From the consistency property of (5) there can be obtained a B\u00e4cklund\ntransformation as follows:\n\u03c4\u0304 \u03c3\u0303 = p\u03c4\u0304 \u0303\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c4\u0303 \u03c3\u0304,\n\u03c4\u0304 \u03c3\u0302 = q \u03c4\u0304\u02c6\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c4\u0302 \u03c3\u0304.\n\n(6a)\n(6b)\n\n2 This convention is a convenient notational device which avoids the need to separate equations such as (4) into sub\ncases n = 1, n \u2208 {2, . . . , N \u2212 1} and n = N .\n\n2\n\n\fHere, if \u03c4 = \u03c4 (l, m, n) is a solution of (5) then the coupled system (6) for \u03c3 is consistent and\ndetermines a function \u03c3 = \u03c3(l, m, n) also satisfying (5). This is a weak B\u00e4cklund transformation3 ,\nin fact the equation emerging as compatibility constraint for (6) is\n\u0014\n\u0015\u2212\np\u03c4\u0302 \u03c4\u0304 \u0303 \u2212 q\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4\u0304\u02c6\np\u03c4\u0302 \u03c4\u0304 \u0303 \u2212 q\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4\u0304\u02c6\n=\n,\n(7)\n\u03c4\u0304 \u03c4\u0303\u02c6\n\u03c4\u0304 \u03c4\u0303\u02c6\nand it can be directly verified that (6) is a B\u00e4cklund transformation, in the strong sense, for\nthis equation. The equation (7) lies on a 10-point stencil on the three-dimensional lattice, by\nintegration it can be seen as a non-autonomous version of (5).\nThe equation (4) governs solutions of (7) satisfying the following additional constraints\n\u03c4 (l, m, n + N + 1) = \u03c4 (l, m, n),\n\u03c4 (l, m, 0) = 1,\n\nl, m, n \u2208 Z,\n\n(8a)\n\nl, m \u2208 Z,\n\n(8b)\n\nwhich can be seen by identifying\nvn (l, m) := \u03c4 (l, m, n),\n\nl, m \u2208 Z,\n\nn \u2208 {1, . . . , N }.\n\n(9)\n\nThe first constraint (8a) is simply an imposed periodicity, the second constraint (8b) is not so\nusual, it consists of some particular boundary data.\n\n2.2\n\nIntegrability\n\nThe original B\u00e4cklund transformation (6) of equation (7) does not preserve the constraints (8) but\nit is consistent with the first constraint (8a). That is, we may write\n\u03c3(l, m, n + N + 1) = \u03c3(l, m, n),\n\nl, m, n \u2208 Z\n\n(10)\n\nwithout breaking the consistency. The further observation that this B\u00e4cklund transformation is\nalready linear in \u03c3 makes it, through this reduction procedure, a Lax pair for (4). In other words\ndefining\n\u03c6n (l, m) := \u03c3(l, m, n), l, m \u2208 Z, n \u2208 {0, . . . , N },\n(11)\nand imposing (8) and (10) reduces (6) to the system\n\u03a6\u0303 = Lp (v, \u1e7d)\u03a6,\n\n\u03a6\u0302 = Lq (v, v\u0302)\u03a6,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere\n\u03a6 := [\u03c60 , \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6N ]T ,\nand\n\nv := (v1 , . . . , vN ),\n\n\uf8eb\n\np\u1e7d1 /v1 \u2212\u03bb/v1\n0\n***\n***\n\uf8ec\n0\np\u1e7d2 /v2 \u2212\u03bb\u1e7d1 /v2\n0\n***\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n..\nLp (v, \u1e7d) = \uf8ec\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8ec\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0\n***\n***\n0\np\u1e7dN /vN\n\u2212\u03bb\u1e7dN\n0\n***\n0\nis the (N + 1)-square Lax matrix.

For\nthis property, the vector v = v(l, m) on Z2 is considered instead as a function on the d-dimensional\nregular lattice v = v(l1 , l2 , . . . , ld ) satisfying system (4) in all pairs of directions, where parameters\np, q appearing in (4) associated with the original l and m directions are to be replaced with pairs\nof parameters taken from the larger set p1 , . . . , pd associated with the corresponding l1 , . . . , ld\ndirections. The consistency of this system can be verified directly by calculation.\n3 This terminology was probably first used by McCarthy [6] to distinguish the situation where an equation is strictly\nsufficient for compatibility of the B\u00e4cklund system, as opposed to a strong B\u00e4cklund transformation, where an equation\nemerges as both necessary and sufficient.\n\n3\n\n\f2.3\n\nPoint symmetries\n\nThe system (4) is invariant under the scaling symmetry\n(v1 , . . . , vN ) \u2192 (\u03bc1 v1 , . . . , \u03bcN vN ),\n\n\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcN \u2208 C \\ {0},\n\n(16)\n\nas well as the less obvious transformation\n(v1 , v2 , . . . , vN\u22121 , vN ) \u2192 (v2 /v1 , v3 /v1 , . . . , vN /v1 , 1/v1 ).\n\n(17)\n\nThe latter transformation here generates a group of N similar symmetries of (4). Such autonomous\npoint symmetries allow an equation to take on alternative guises via a non-autonomous point transformation that preserves the autonomous nature of the equation, and also preserves its multidimensional consistency property (see for instance [5, 3]). Explicitly, if S1 and S2 are (commuting)\ntransformations of the vector v = (v1 , . . . , vN ) taken from the group generated by (16) and (17),\nand v is governed by (4), then the equation governing v \u2032 = [S1l * S2m ](v) is both autonomous and\nmultidimensionally consistent. The autonomous nature of the equation is preserved due to the\nfact the Si are symmetries, whilst the natural extension to multidimensions of the transformation:\n[S1l * S2m ] \u2192 [S1l1 * S2l2 * S3l3 * . . .], demonstrates also that the consistency is preserved.\nThis is an important part of the transformation theory of multi-component systems such as (4)\nbecause invariants of such transformations are not presently known beyond the multi-affine class\n[1]. The less obvious symmetry (17) is included here because to distinguish between genuinely\ndifferent quad equations in the multi-component class, it is necessary to be aware of all such\ntransformations.\n\n3\n\nLagrangian structure\n\nFor discrete systems where each lattice direction is on an equal footing it appears that the Lagrangian is a more natural object than the Hamiltonian, given that it does not single out any\none direction. Therefore an important feature of the multicomponent quad equation (4) is its\nLagrangian structure, which as we will see is inherited from that of Hirota's discrete KP equation\n(5). The more remarkable feature is its natural interplay with the multidimensional consistency\nof the model, which will be explained in the following section (Section 4).\nA Lagrangian for the system (4) is\nLpq\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u00132\n\u0012 \u0012\nN \u001a\nX\n\u0001\nq\u1e7di v\u0302i+1\n1\nq\u1e7di v\u0302i+1\n1\nLi2\n+\nln \u2212\n+ ln v\u0302i ln \u1e7di+1 \u2212 ln \u1e7di ln v\u0302i+1\npv\u0302\n4\npv\u0302\n2\ni \u1e7di+1\ni \u1e7di+1\ni=0\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013\u001b\nvi+1\n\u1e7di\n+ ln\nln\n,\n(18)\nvi\nv\u0302i\n\nwhich through the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations gives 2 copies of the equations. The function\nLi2 is the dilogarithm function\nZ z\nln(1 \u2212 z)\nLi2 (z) = \u2212\ndz,\n(19)\nz\n0\nwhich appears in many areas of physics, such as quantum electrodynamics (e.g. vacuum polarization) and electrical network problems; it also comes up in connection with algebraic K-theory,\nrepresentation theory of infinite dimensional algebras, and combinatorics [11].\nBy discrete Euler-Lagrange equations we mean in this case\n\u2202Lpq\n\u2202Lpq\n\u2202Lpq\n\u03b4Lpq\n\u2261\n+ Tp\u22121\n+ Tq\u22121\n= 0,\n\u03b4vi\n\u2202vi\n\u2202\u1e7di\n\u2202v\u0302i\n\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , N },\n\n(20)\n\nwhere Tp is a shift operator in the lattice direction associated with parameter p, and similarly Tq\nis a shift operator in the lattice direction associated with parameter q. Then Tp\u22121 , Tq\u22121 are simply\nbackwards shifts in the lattice.\n\n4\n\n\fThe discrete Euler-Lagrange equations arise from extremizing the action\nS\n\n=\n\nN \u001a\nXXX\nl\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\u00132\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0001\nq\u1e7di v\u0302i+1\n1\n1\nq\u1e7di v\u0302i+1\n+\n+ ln v\u0302i ln \u1e7di+1 \u2212 ln \u1e7di ln v\u0302i+1\nln \u2212\npv\u0302i \u1e7di+1\n4\npv\u0302i \u1e7di+1\n2\nm i=0\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013\u001b\n\u0012\n\u1e7di\nvi+1\nln\n,\n(21)\n+ ln\nvi\nv\u0302i\nLi2\n\n\u0012\n\nwhere the first two sums over l and m are understood to be taken over the whole 2-dimensional\nlattice. In fact, rather than the Lagrangian by itself, it is more instructive to look at the action,\nsince it is on this level that we can easily see we are dealing with a reduction of the bilinear discrete\nKP equation\nApq \u03c4\u0304 \u03c4\u0303\u02c6 + Aqr \u03c4\u0303 \u03c4\u0304\u02c6 + Arp \u03c4\u0302 \u03c4\u0304 \u0303 = 0;\n(22)\nhere the dependent variable is \u03c4 , and the Apq are antisymmetric constants (so that Aqp = \u2212Apq )\nassociated with the p, q lattice directions. Making the identification Apr /Apq = p, Aqr /Apq = q\nand \u03c4 = u, so that the equation is no longer covariant due to the singled-out lattice direction,\nbrings us to equation (5). A Lagrangian for (22) was presented in [14], which, adapted for the\nnon-covariant equation (5), is equivalent to\nX X X\u001a \u0012 q\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4\u0304\u02c6 \u0013 1 \u0012 \u0012 q\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4\u0304\u02c6 \u0013\u00132 1\n\u0001\nLi2\nSKP =\nln \u2212\n+\n+ ln \u03c4\u0302 ln \u03c4\u0304 \u0303 \u2212 ln \u03c4\u0303 ln \u03c4\u0304\u02c6\n \u0303\n \u0303\n4\n2\np\u03c4\u0302\n\u03c4\u0304\np\u03c4\u0302\n\u03c4\u0304\nm\nn\nl\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013\u001b\n\u03c4\u0304\n\u03c4\u0303\n+ ln\nln\n.\n(23)\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\u0302\nIt is clear that identifying \u03c4 = vi , \u03c4\u0304 = vi+1 , and restricting the sum over n, we get the action (21)\nof the reduction.\n\n4\n\nClosure property\n\nThe Lagrangians for many integrable systems can be interpreted as closed forms; they obey a\nclosure relation on solutions when consistently embedded in a higher-dimensional space. In a\nsense one can consider this to be multidimensional consistency on the level of the Lagrangian. It\nallows for a variational principle which includes the geometry of the space of independent variables,\nas well as that of the dependent variables; seeking extrema of the action under variations with\nrespect to all of the variables, dependent and independent, leads to constraints which specify not\nonly the equations of motion, but also to an extent the Lagrangians themselves.\nIn the case of 2-dimensional systems, we have Lagrangian 2-forms, for instance Lagrangian\nfunctions which are evaluated on 2-dimensional plaquettes. For multidimensionally consistent\nsystems we can suppose the action to be defined on a surface in an arbitrary number of dimensions,\nnot just two, and this action will be a sum of the Lagrangian function evaluated on every plaquette\nin that surface. Demanding zero variation with respect to the surface implies a closure relation on\nthe Lagrangian, while variation with respect to the dependent variable gives equations of motion.\nExamples can be found in both discrete and continuous cases of 1-dimensional systems [24, 25],\na large class of 2-dimensional systems [13, 15, 23], and also the 3-dimensional discrete bilinear KP\nequation [14]. In [15] it was demonstrated that the Lagrangian for an arbitrary member of the\nlattice GD hierarchy obeys the closure relation\n\u2206p Lqr + \u2206q Lrp + \u2206r Lpq = 0,\n\n(24)\n\non solutions to the lattice KP equation (the lattice KP equation is a consequence of the equations\nwhich constitute the lattice GD hierarchy itself).

well as the one given here,\nare of course of interest. The multidimensional consistency was used as integrability criterion to\nobtain generalizations of the lattice Boussinesq equation in [8], and identification of these systems\nwith a generalized dispersion relation within the direct linearization framework [26] opens up\na potentially fruitful avenue in this direction. As indicated in Section 2.3, the transformation\ntheory of such systems is quite involved even before non-local B\u00e4cklund-type transformations are\nconsidered.\n\n8\n\n\fThere is also a hierarchy presented in [2] with the lattice Schwarzian KdV and lattice Schwarzian\nBoussinesq equations as the lowest two members; this system was obtained directly in relation to\nthe modified hierarchy (4) by generalizing a B\u00e4cklund transformation known in the case N = 1\nsince [18]:\nz\u0303n \u2212 zn\n\n=\n\n\u1e91n \u2212 zn\n\n=\n\n1 vn+1 \u1e7dn\u22121\n,\np vn \u1e7dn\n1 vn+1 v\u0302n\u22121\n,\nq vn v\u0302n\n\n(32a)\n(32b)\n\nwhere n \u2208 {1, . . . , N } and by our convention v0 = vN+1 = 1 as usual. It can readily be seen that\nthis system is compatible in the zn provided the vn satisfy (4), and similarly it is compatible in\nthe vn provided the zn satisfy the system\n\u1e91i+1 \u2212 zi+1\nz\u0303i+1 \u2212 zi+1\n\n=\n\nN\npN+1 Y z\u0303i \u2212 zi\nq N+1 i=1 \u1e91i \u2212 zi\n\n=\n\nz\u0303\u02c6i \u2212 z\u0303i\n,\nz\u0303\u02c6i \u2212 \u1e91i\nz\u0303\u02c6N \u2212 z\u0303N\n.\nz\u0303\u02c6N \u2212 \u1e91N\n\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , N \u2212 1},\n\n(33a)\n(33b)\n\nUnlike for the modified hierarchy from which it is derived, the expected Lagrangian formulation\nof this multidimensionally consistent Schwarzian hierarchy is presently not known.\nThe Lagrangian formulation of the multicomponent quad equation in this paper contributes to\nthe mounting evidence that the closure relation and the associated least-action principle are key\nproperties of discrete integrable systems (and indeed of the corresponding continuous systems as\nwell, cf. [23]). An important motivating factor to study such a structure is its potential physical\nsignificance; in particular the Lagrangian multi-form structure constitutes a possible departure\npoint for the quantization of such integrable models along the line of a path integral formulation.\n\nAcknowledgments\nJA was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Grant #DP110104151.\nSBL was supported by the ARC Discovery Grant #DP110100077.
