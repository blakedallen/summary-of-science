D ISCRETE -T IME M EMORYLESS M ULTI - HOP N ETWORK\nWe define a linear multi-hop network as a network where\na pair of source and destination terminals communicate with\neach other by routing their data through multiple intermediate relay terminals. We assume that the linear multi-hop\nnetwork consists of N + 1 terminals; the source terminal\nis identified as T1 , the destination terminal is identified as\nTN +1 , and the intermediate terminals are identified as T2 TN , where N is the number of hops along the transmission\npath. As terminals can often not transmit and receive at\nthe same time, we only focus on time-division based (half\nduplex) relaying. In particular, we consider a simple N -hop\ndecode-and-forward protocol, where, at hop n, relay terminal\nTn+1 , n = 1, ..., N \u2212 1 hears and attempts to fully decode\nthe data signal transmitted from terminal Tn and forwards\nits re-encoded version over hop n + 1 to terminal Tn+2 , as\ndepicted in Fig. 1.\nTo model block-coded communication over the linear\nRN\n), {Qn }N\nmulti-hop network, a ((eQ1 R1 , ..., eQNP\nn=1 , Q)\nN\ncode CQ is defined by a codebook of n=1 eQn Rn codewords such that Rn is the rate of communication over hop\nn (in nats per channel\nQn is the coding blocklength\nPuse),\nN\nover hop n and Q = n=1 Qn is the fixed total number of\nchannel uses over the multi-hop link, representing a delayconstraint in the end-to-end sense, i.e., the time-division\nbased N -hop\nP communication takes place over the total\nduration of N\nn=1 Qn = Q symbol periods.

The codebook\nfor multi-hop transmissions is determined by the encoding\nfunctions \u03c6n , n = 1, ..., N , that map each message wn \u2208\nWn = {1, ..., eQn Rn } over hop n to a transmit codeword\nsn,q \u2208 S1 is the\nsn = [ sn,1 , ... , sn,Qn ] \u2208 C1\u00d7Qn , where\nPn\u22121\ntransmitted symbol over hop n at time m=1 Qm +q, which\nis drawn according to a continuous distribution p(s) defined\non a complex-valued infinite alphabet. The strictly positive\ntime-sharing constant \u03bbn = Qn /Q > 0 is defined as the\nfractional time over which the transmission and reception\nover hop n is active.\nLet P (yn |sn , \u03b8n ), for sn \u2208 SQn and yn \u2208 YQn , be the\nconditional probability density of receiving sequence yn ,\ngiven that sn was transmitted and the channel state over\nhop n is given by \u03b8n , which is drawn from an arbitrarysize state space \u0398 of channel states. Thus, our multi-state\nchannel model concentrates on the quasi-static regime, in\nwhich, once drawn, the channel states {\u03b8n }N\nn=1 remain fixed\nfor the entire duration of the respective hop transmissions\nover blocklengths {Qn }N\nn=1 . The channel over each hop\nn = 1, ..., N is assumed to be a discrete-time infinitealphabet memoryless channel (DTMC) satisfying\nP (yn |sn , \u03b8n ) =\n\nQn\nY\n\np(yn,q |sn,q , \u03b8n ).\n\nq=1\n\nfor all sn \u2208 SQn , and yn \u2208 YQn and for all Qn , where\np(y|s, \u03b8) is the conditional probability density of receiving\noutput symbol y chosen from support set Y1 given that the\ninput symbol was s chosen from support set S1 and the\nchannel state was \u03b8 chosen from support set \u0398. The channels\nover different hops are assumed to exhibit independent and\nidentical (i.e., i.i.d. across n) statistical behavior. We shall\nassume that each transmitting terminal Tn , n = 1, ..., N\nand each receiving terminal Tn+1 , n = 1, ..., N possesses\nthe knowledge of the channel state \u03b8n over hop n, for\n\n\fn = 1, ..., N , which allows transmission rate Rn to be chosen\nin a way that guarantees a desired level of reliability for a\ngiven coding blocklength Qn , e.g., Rn could be chosen to\nenable perfectly reliable communication provided that coding\nblocklength Qn is large. It should be emphasized that we\nonly assume the presence of local channel state information\n(CSI) at the terminals, where each terminal knows perfectly\nthe transmit and receive CSI regarding its neighboring links\nonly, and our results do not require the presence of global\nCSI at the terminals over the multi-hop network.\nEach receiving terminal employs a decoding function\n\u03c8n , n = 1, ..., N to perform the mapping C1\u00d7Qn \u2192\n\u0175n \u2208 Wn based on its observed signal vector yn =\n[ yn,1 , ... , yn,Qn ] according to the maximum likelihood decoding rule,\nwhere yn,q \u2208 Y1 is the received symbol over hop\nPn\u22121\nn at time m=1 Qm + q. The codeword error probability for\nthe n-th hop is given by \u01ebn = P(\u03c8n (yn ) 6= wn ). An N -tuple\nof multi-hop rates (R1 , ..., RN ) is achievable if there exists a\nsequence of ((eQ1 R1 , ..., eQN RN ), {Qn }N\nn=1 , Q) codes {CQ :\nPN\nQ\n,\n\u03bbn > 0, \u2200n, and\nQ = 1, 2, ...} with Q =\nn\nn=1\nvanishing \u01ebn , \u2200n.\nThe ensemble of codes {SQn }N\nn=1 to be transmitted over\nthe multi-hop link is chosen by defining a probability measure P (sn ) on the set SQn of possible input sequences to\nthe channel over hop n. An ensemble of Mn = eQn Rn\ncodewords is constructed for transmission over hop n by\npicking each codeword independently, according to the probability measure P (sn ). Thus the probability associated\nwith\nQMn\na code consisting of codewords s1 ,...,sMn is m=1\nP (sm ).\nFurthermore, we restrict the class of ensembles of codes\nunder consideration to those in which each symbol of each\ncodeword is chosen independently of all other\nQQn symbols with\np(sn,q ).\na probability measure p(s), i.e. P (sn ) = q=1\nII. R ELIABILITY B OUNDS\n\nFOR\n\nM ULTI - HOP N ETWORKS\n\nCapacity and mutual information in linear multi-hop networks have been characterized in [2]-[5]. In particular, based\non the model introduced by Section I, we characterized in [5]\nthe end-to-end mutual information I (in nats per channel use)\nof the linear multi-hop network conditional on the channel\nstates {\u03b8n }N\nn=1 as\nI({\u03b8n }N\nn=1 )\n\n=\n=\n\n1\nQ\n\nPN max\nn=1 Qn =Q\n\nmin\nn\n\nQn\nX\n\nI(Sn,q ; Yn,q | \u03b8n )\n\nq=1\n\nmin {\u03bbn In (Sn ; Yn\nPNmax\nn\nn=1 \u03bbn =1\n\n| \u03b8n )} , (1)\n\nwhere \u03bbn \u2208 [0, 1] is the fractional time of the channel\ncorresponding to hop n, i.e. \u03bbn = Qn /Q, In (Sn,q ; Yn,q | \u03b8n )\nis the conditional mutual information (a random variable\nthat depends on the channel state \u03b8n ) over hop n at time\nP\nn\u22121\nm=1 Qm + q and the second line of (1) follows from\nthe fact that the transmit symbols {sn,q } are drawn in an\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) fashion across\nq = 1, ..., Qn based on the probability density p(s) and that\nfor any given state \u03b8n , the channel over hop n that maps\nthe input symbol vector sn to the output symbol vector\n\nyn acts i.i.d. across q = 1, ..., Qn (based on the DTMC\nmodel) dictated by the conditional probability density function p(y|s, \u03b8n ). This formulation assumes that the channel\nstate \u03b8n is known by both transmit terminal Tn and receive\nterminal Tn+1 . The minimax point of (1) is achieved by\nchoosing (\u03bb\u22171 , ..., \u03bb\u2217N ) such that\nQ\nk6=n Ik (Sk ; Yk | \u03b8k )\n\u2217\n, n = 1, ..., N,\n\u03bbn = PN Q\nk=1\nk6=n Ik (Sk ; Yk | \u03b8k )\nwhich results in\n\nI({\u03b8n }N\nn=1 )\n\n=\n\nQN\n\nn=1 In (Sn ; Yn\n\nPN\n\nk=1\n\n=\n\nPN\n\nQ\n\n| \u03b8n )\n\nk6=n Ik (Sk ; Yk\n\n1\n\n1\nn=1 In (Sn ;Yn | \u03b8n )\n\n| \u03b8k )\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nKnowing the capacity of a channel is not always sufficient.\nOne may be interested in how hard it is to get close to this\ncapacity while guaranteeing a certain level of reliability. In\nparticular, one of the most important tradeoffs in the design\nof reliable adhoc networks and multi-hop communication\nsystems is the tradeoff between end-to-end system delay and\nprobability of error for a given set of achievable rates over\nmultiple hops. Upper and lower bounds on the probability\nof decoding error based on error exponents and sphere\npacking exponents provide a partial answer to this question\nby giving reliability bounds achievable by the best block\ncodes of a certain length and rate, which help to quantify\nthe exponential rate of decrease in error probability with\nincreasing blocklength. Our objective here is to analyze\nthese reliability exponent functions over the discrete-time\nmemoryless multi-hop network, and provide insights on the\ntradeoffs among achievable rates, error probability and endto-end delay in multi-hop networks.\nAssuming point-to-point coding over each hop, we define the reliability function of the DTMC over hop n,\nEn (Rn , \u03b8n ), as [1]\nEn (Rn , \u03b8n ) = lim \u2212\nQn \u2192\u221e\n\nln (Pe,n (Qn , Rn , \u03b8n ))\nn = 1, ..., N\nQn\n\nwhere Pe,n (Qn , Rn , \u03b8n ) is the minimum codeword error\nprobability over the nth hop for all codes of blocklength\nQn and transmission rate Rn (in nats per channel use) given\nthe channel state \u03b8n . For each DTMC in the linear multi-hop\nnetwork, the minimum probability of decoding error Pe,n for\ncodes of blocklength Qn can be bounded for any rate below\nthe capacity between the limits\ne\u2212Qn [Esp,n (Rn ,\u03b8n )+O(Qn )] \u2264 Pe,n \u2264 e\u2212Qn Er,n (Rn ,\u03b8n ) .\nIn this expression, Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) and Esp,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) are\nlower and upper bounds, respectively, on the reliability function En (Rn , \u03b8n ), and are known as the error exponent and\nsphere packing exponent, respectively and O(Qn ) is a function going to 0 with increasing Qn . It should also be noted\nthat for any given Qn , Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) = Esp,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) =\nEn (Rn , \u03b8n ) for Rcr,n \u2264 Rn \u2264 In (\u03b8n ) where Rcr,n is the\ncritical rate for hop n and In (\u03b8n ) is the maximum achievable\n\n\fIn (\u03b8n ) = sup\np(s)\n\nZ\n\nS1\n\nZ\n\np(s)p(y|s, \u03b8n ) ln\n\nY1\n\nmutual information conditional on the channel state \u03b8n (or\nShannon capacity, which exists since the channel state \u03b8n\nis known by both transmit terminal Tn and receive terminal\nTn+1 ) over hop n expressed by (3), and thus the exponential\ndependence of error probability on blocklength quantified by\nthe reliability function En (Rn , \u03b8n ) is known exactly in this\nrange (i.e., for all rates above the critical rate). The random\ncoding error exponent Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) over hop n is given by\nEr,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) = max [\u2212\u03c1Rn + E0,n (\u03c1, \u03b8n )] ,\n0\u2264\u03c1\u22641\n\nEsp,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) = max [\u2212\u03c1Rn + E0,n (\u03c1, \u03b8n )] .\n0<\u03c1<\u221e\n\n(6)\n\nWe see that the only difference between the error exponent\nand sphere packing exponent is in the range for which the\noptimization over \u03c1 is performed. If the maximizing \u03c1 lies\nbetween 0 and 1, then Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) = Esp,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) =\nEn (Rn , \u03b8n ) and therefore the upper and lower bounds to\nerror probability agree in their exponential dependence on\nQn . Thus, if Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) = Esp,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) for one value\nof Rn , then equality also holds for all larger values of Rn .\nWe define the critical rate over hop n, denoted by Rcr,n , as\nthe smallest Rn such that Esp,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) = Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n ),\nwhich thus holds for Rcr,n \u2264 Rn \u2264 In (\u03b8n ). It should be\nobserved that for all Rn < Rcr,n , the maximum over \u03c1 of\nEr,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) occurs at \u03c1 = 1.

To this end, we define the system reliability\nfunction as a measure for the probability of error in an\nend-to-end sense over the multi-hop network by summing\nthe error probabilities {Pe,n }N\nn=1 over each hop. A union\nbound interpretation can also be attached to this measure,\nas the end-to-end error probability can be upperbounded\nby the sum of individual link error probabilities. Thus the\nsystem probability of error for the linear multi-hop network\nis defined as\nN\n\u0001 X\nN\nPe,n (Qn , Rn , \u03b8n ),\nPe Q, {Rn }N\nn=1 , {\u03b8n }n=1 =\nn=1\n\nand consequently, the end-to-end\nsystem reliability function\n\u0001\nN\nis\ndefined\nas given in (13). Based\n,\n{\u03b8\n}\nEsys {Rn }N\nn n=1\nn=1\non the random coding upper bound and sphere packing lower\nbound, the system probability of error can be bounded by the\nexpression in (14), and consequently, the system reliability\nfunction can be written as in (15).\nReliability-Optimal Block Allocation. In this setting,\nour objective is to choose coding blocklengths {Qn }N\nn=1\noptimally in order to maximize multi-hop link reliability.\nTo this end, we should now minimizePthe upper and lower\nN\nbounds on Pe subject to the constraint n=1 Qn = Q, which\ntranslates into the maximization of the system reliability\nfunction leading to (16). Carrying out the optimization using\nLagrange multipliers and utilizing from the error exponent\nand sphere packing exponent lower and upper bounds, respectively, on the per-hop reliability function, we find that\nthe optimal blocklengths {Q\u2217n }N\nn=1 can be bounded as in\n\n\fE0,n (\u03c1, \u03b8n ) = sup\np(s)\n\n(\n\n\u2212 ln\n\nN\nEsys {Rn }N\nn=1 , {\u03b8n }n=1\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nln\nlim \u2212\n\nQ\u2192\u221e\n\nmin\n\n1/(1+\u03c1)\n\np(s)p(y|s, \u03b8n )\n\nds\n\n\u00151+\u03c1\n\n(5)\n\n\u0001\nN\nln Pe (Q, {Rn }N\nn=1 , {\u03b8n }n=1 )\n= lim \u2212\nQ\u2192\u221e\nQ\n\n(13)\n\nS1\n\ndy\n\n)\n\n.\n\nY1\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0014Z\n\nN\n\u0001 X\nN\nexp (\u2212Qn Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n ))\nexp (\u2212Qn Esp,n (Rn , \u03b8n )) \u2264 Pe Q, {Rn }N\nn=1 , {\u03b8n }n=1 \u2264\n\n(14)\n\nn=1\n\n\u0010P\nN\n\n\u0011\nexp\n(\u2212Q\nE\n(R\n,\n\u03b8\n))\nn sp,n\nn n\nn=1\nQ\n\nEsys\n\n\u001a\n\nZ\n\n\u0001\nN\n\u2264 Esys {Rn }N\nn=1 , {\u03b8n }n=1 \u2264 lim \u2212\nQ\u2192\u221e\n\nln\n\n\u0010P\n\nN\nn=1\n\n\u0011\nexp (\u2212Qn Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n ))\n\n\u0001\nN\n\u0001\nln Pe (Q, {Rn }N\nn=1 , {\u03b8n }n=1 )\nN\nN\n\u2212\n{Rn }n=1 , {\u03b8n }n=1 = lim P max\nN\nQ\u2192\u221e\nQ\nn=1 Qn =Q\n\nln Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) \u2212 \u03bbr ln Esp,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) \u2212 \u03bbsp\n,\nEr,n (Rn , \u03b8n )\nEsp,n (Rn , \u03b8n )\n\n\u001b\n\n<\n\nQ\u2217n\n\n(17), where constants \u03bbr and \u03bbsp are given by\n!\u22121\n!\nN\nN\nX\nX\nln Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n )\n1\n\u2212Q ,\n\u03bbr =\nE (Rn , \u03b8n )\nEr,n (Rn , \u03b8n )\nn=1\nn=1 r,n\n\n< max\n\n\u001a\n\nQ\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\n\u001b\nln Er,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) \u2212 \u03bbr ln Esp,n (Rn , \u03b8n ) \u2212 \u03bbsp\n,\nEr,n (Rn , \u03b8n )\nEsp,n (Rn , \u03b8n )\n(17)\n\n(i.e., Rn = In (Sn ; Yn | \u03b8n ), \u2200n), it also holds that Qn Rn =\nQk Rk , 1 \u2264 n < k \u2264 N and the time-sharing coefficient\ncan be determined as \u03bbn = Qn /Q = R/Rn .

Such a distributed approach involves\nthe end-to-end propagation of a single parameter; only\nrequiring neighbor-to-neighbor message passing of the\naccumulated multi-hop link cost metric which is updated by\neach terminal with the addition\nPN of the cost of the last hop.\nOnce the total route cost n=1 R1n has been determined by\none of the end terminals, the value of M can be computed\nand broadcasted to all the terminals in the linear multi-hop\nnetwork.\nSimilar distributed approaches can be applied to perform\nreliability-optimal block allocation over multi-hop networks\nso that, for instance, terminal Tn can design its transmit\ncodebook over hop n using only the local channel state \u03b8n\nand relation in (17), which would be sufficient to choose\nQn and Rn to minimize the system probability of error.

The transition\nfrom state n to state n + 1 represents the transmissions\nfrom terminal Tn to terminal Tn+1 over hop n and each\ntransmission could result in a success which means that the\nMarkov chain arrives at state n + 1 or in a failure which\nmeans that the Markov chain remains at state n. The statetransition probabilities are functions of the codeword error\nprobabilities Pe,n , which stay constant over retransmissions\n(since {\u03b8n }N\nn=1 do not change). Arrival at state N +1 implies\nsuccessful decoding of the message by the destination terminal TN +1 , and thus this state is modeled as an absorption\nstate; which means that the Markov chain terminates upon\nentering this state (i.e., no more transmissions are necessary),\nwhereas states 1, ..., N are transient.\nOur objective is use the described Markov chain model to\ncompute the expected value of end-to-end latency T in terms\nof the total required number of channel uses until successful\nreception of the message by the destination terminal. Toward\nthis goal, we define the stopping time J of the Markov\nprocess as\nJ = min{j \u2265 1 : Zj = N + 1 | Z1 = 1},\nbased on which T can be represented as\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nJ\u22121\nX\nT = E\uf8f0\nQZj | Z1 = 1\uf8fb .\nj=1\n\nThis expectation can easily be computed by using the wellknown first-step analysis technique based on the application\nof the law of total probability, exploting the Markov property\nof the process Zj .

In this setting, an ARQ protocol is considered,\nwhere, upon detection of codeword error (e.g., practical\nsystems typically use a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)\ncode), the erroneous codeword is discarded by the receiver\nand the retransmission of the codeword is requested from the\ntransmitter.

This is remarkable, especially\nconsidering the fact that the end-to-end delay\nPN level is the\nsame for both systems under the constraint n=1 Qn = Q.\nIn addition, we observe that under a fixed end-to-end delay\nconstraint, information-continuous allocation of blocks yields\na reliability that is close to that yielded by error-minimal\nblock allocation, especially for the range of rates close to\ncapacity. It should be mentioned that, consistent with the\ncapacity results of [4]-[5], the superior performance of multihop communication is at the low SNR ranges only, and for\nhigh SNR values, single-hop communication yields a better\nrate-reliability-delay tradeoff.\nUnder the same set of assumptions, we use (19) to plot in\nFig. 4 the expected value of end-to-end latency for singlehop and two-hop communication schemes as a function of\nend-to-end data rate for reliability-optimal block allocation\nwith the support of the ARQ protocol described in Section\nIII. We observe that the upper and lower bounds on the\nexpected value of the end-to-end latency obtained by error exponents and sphere packing exponents, respectively,\noverlap with each other in full agreement, indicating the\naccuracy of our latency characterization. From this result,\nit is clear that the two-hop scheme outperforms the single-\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nhop scheme in terms of the end-to-end latency performance\nin the presence of ARQ-based retransmission mechanisms,\nwhich is another evidence for the enhancement of the ratereliability-delay tradeoff through multi-hop communication\nin the low SNR regime. In contrast, it should be noted that the\nnumerical results obtained through the evaluation of (19) in\nthe high SNR regime indicate that single-hop communication\nis preferable over multi-hop communication and hence, once\nagain, the observed trends are consistent with the insights\nobtained from the capacity analysis of [4]-[5].\nV. C ONCLUSIONS\nWe characterized the end-to-end rate-reliability-delay\ntradeoff over a linear multi-hop network composed of multistate discrete memoryless channels over each hop, with\northogonal time-sharing across hops under a half-duplex\nrelaying protocol. Based on this general framework, we\nprovided numerical results on the performance comparison\nbetween multi-hop and single-hop communication focusing\non AWGN channels. Our analysis has led to the following\nconclusions:\n\u2022 Multi-hop communication yields better end-to-end reliability over single-hop communication in the low SNR\nregime for a given set of achievable per-hop data rates\nunder an end-to-end delay constraint.\n\u2022 Information-continuous block allocation yields an error\nperformance close to that achieved by reliability-optimal\nblock allocation under the imposed end-to-end delay\nconstraint, especially for the set of per-hop rates close\nto capacity.\n\u2022 Multi-hop communication outperforms single-hop communication in terms of the end-to-end latency performance in the low SNR regime in the presence of ARQbased retransmission mechanisms.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] R.
