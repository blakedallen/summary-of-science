These nonlinear\nsystems possess many interesting features due to their integrability [5, 6]. Among these,\nthe existence of a linear system of equations and of an infinite number of conservation laws\nassociated with nonlocal charges are two central properties from which others (such as the\nB\u00e4cklund transformations) can be obtained. Making use of the conserved, curvature free\nconnections present in these models, an infinite number of conserved currents can be explicitly\nconstructed by an inductive procedure due to Br\u00e9zin et. al. [7], and a linear system of\nequations can thereby be easily obtained via introducing a spectral parameter. It can be\nverified that the latter imply the field equations as well as the zero-curvature condition on\nthe appropriate connection. Nonlocal charges, if conserved at the quantum level, play a\ncrucial role in finding the S-matrix and proving its factorizability, and hence the quantum\nintegrability of a given model. It is known that O(N ) and CP 1 models [8, 9] and principal\nchiral models based on certain classical groups [12, 13] are quantum integrable, while CP N\n(N \u2265 2) is not [10]. More generally, sigma models on compact symmetric spaces G/H with\nH simple are known to be quantum integrable [11].\nSupersymmetric(SUSY) extensions of these nonlinear systems both at the classical and at\nthe quantum level have also been extensively studied in the past few decades [14, 15, 16, 17,\n18, 19, 20]. At the classical level, conserved currents of the supersymmetric O(N ) and CP N\nmodels were derived in component formalism in [19]. Later on, a much simpler superfield\nformulation with or without the SUSY WZW term was given in [20]. In [16], it was shown\nthat supersymmetry renders the CP N model quantum integrable.\nNoncommutative(NC) field theories have been under investigation for about a decade\nnow. (See, for instance [21, 22] for comprehensive reviews) Among them, field theories\ndefined on the Groenewold-Moyal (GM)-type deformations of spacetime [i.e., the noncommutative algebra A\u03b8 (R(d+1) )] hold a considerably large part of the literature. Formulation\nof instantons and solitons in GM spacetime and other noncommutative spaces, such as the\nnoncommutative tori and fuzzy spaces, has been extensively studied and found to present\nvery rich mathematical structures [21, 22, 23, 24]. It has been found out that such noncommutative deformations of extended field configurations may be useful in studying the physics\nof D-branes, as certain low energy limits in string theory in the presence of background\nmagnetic fields lead to noncommutative Yang-Mills (YM) theories [25], [26, 27].\nIntegrability properties of noncommutative nonlinear theories have been under investigation in the past decade as well. In [28], Dimakis and M\u00fcller-Hoissen have studied the\nexistence and construction of conserved currents in nonlinear sigma models on noncommutative spaces where an appropriate notion of the Hodge operator can be prescribed, including\nthe GM plane. Formulation of nonlinear sigma models on noncommutative 2\u2212torus with\ntwo-point target space and construction of its conserved currents along the lines of [7] were\ngiven in [29].\nIn [30], a linear system of equations for noncommutative YM theory has been presented\nand it has been employed to discuss the construction of the NC 't Hooft instantons using\nthe splitting approach. Later on, in [31] the presence of this linear system was used to\n\n1\n\n\fstudy the formulation of YM instantons via the dressing and splitting methods, and in [32]\nthat of monopoles by solving the appropriate Riemann-Hilbert problem, after a dimensional\nreduction. Another example of an integrable noncommutative theory is the U (N ) Ward\nmodel studied in Ref. [33]. This model is formulated in A\u03b8 (R2+1 ) and it too explicitly exhibits\na linear system implying the equation of motion, and applying the dressing method gives a\nsystematic way to construct its solitonic solutions. It is worthwhile to note that, particular\nnoncommutative extensions of WZW and sine-Gordon models are obtained from this system\nvia dimensional reduction. The latter possess several attractive features as discussed in [34]\nand [35]. Supersymmetric extensions of the noncommutative Ward model and its solitonic\nsolutions are recently considered in [36].\nIn this paper, our purpose is to discuss the integrability properties of nonlinear sigma\nmodels defined on the GM spacetime. In particular, we will focus on the construction of\nan infinite number of conserved currents of the principal chiral model in A\u03b8 (R1+1 ), the CP 1\nmodel, and a certain CP 1 submodel in A\u03b8 (R2+1 ). We will also treat their supersymmetric\nextensions. In section 2, we start by describing the integrability properties of the principal\nchiral model in A\u03b8 (R(1+1) ). Our presentation in section 2.1 has overlaps with the previous\ninvestigations in [28]. Then we specialize to the NC CP 1 model [37], discuss its relevant\nproperties and present its Noether currents explicitly.\nIn section 3, we focus our attention to a certain CP 1 submodel in A\u03b8 (R2+1 ). A novel\napproach to exploring integrability in d + 1 dimensions was introduced by Alvarez et. al.\nin [38], and it essentially consists of formulating a generalized zero-curvature condition by\nintroducing a d-form connection. Quite interestingly, this new formulation helps to reveal\nthe existence of an infinite number of conserved quantities in a variety of models, such as\nthose found for a submodel of CP 1 model in 2 + 1 dimensions. By extending this approach\nand a parallel one developed by Fujii et. al. [43] to noncommutative spacetime, we discuss\nthe integrability properties of the aforementioned CP 1 submodel and construct an infinite\nnumber of conserved currents for it in a systematic manner. We also discuss the solitonic\nsolutions of the submodel in some detail and show that BPS solutions of the NC CP 1 model\nare solutions of the submodel too.\nIn section 4, we examine the supersymmetric principal chiral model in A\u03b8 (R1+1 |2 ) with\nand without the WZW term in some detail. We discuss the integrability properties of these\nmodels and derive their conserved currents in the superfield formalism, using the methods of\n[20]. This is followed by a study of the SUSY extension of the CP 1 submodel in A\u03b8 (R(2+1) |2 )\nand construction of its conserved currents. Solitonic configurations of this model are also\ngiven. We conclude by summarizing our results and stating some directions we are going to\nbe exploring in the near future.\nUntil section 4, we will be working on the noncommutative spacetimes A\u03b8 (R1+1 ) and\nA\u03b8 (R2+1 ), which are defined by the commutation relations\n[x\u0302\u03bc , x\u0302\u03bd ] = i\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nand the indices run over 0, 1 and 0, 1, 2, respectively. We use the Minkowski metric with signature (+ , \u2212 , \u2212). From section 4 onward, appropriate Grassmann variables will be introduced\nto obtain the superspaces A\u03b8 (R1+1 |2 ) and A\u03b8 (R2+1 |2 ), where only the bosonic coordinates\ndo not commute.\n2\n\n\f2.\n\nNonlinear Models and Integrability\n\n2.1.\n\nPrincipal Chiral Model in A\u03b8 (R1+1 ):\n\nLet us start our discussion by considering the principal chiral model in A\u03b8 (R1+1 ). It is defined\nby the action\n1\nSP C = \u03c0\u03b8Tr\u2202\u03bc g\u2202 \u03bc g \u22121 ,\n(2.1)\n4\nwhere g is a nonsingular matrix whose entries are operators in A\u03b8 (R1+1 ) acting on the\nstandard Heisenberg-Weyl Hilbert space H.1 For definiteness, we take g \u2208 U (N ), thus it\nsatisfies gg \u2020 = g \u2020 g = 1. We have that Tr = TrH \u2297 TrN , where TrN is the trace in M at(N ).\nThe equation of the motion following from SP C is\n\u2202 \u03bc (g \u22121 \u2202\u03bc g) = 0 ,\n\n(2.2)\n\noether\nAN\n= g\u22121 \u2202\u03bc g ,\n\u03bc\n\n(2.3)\n\nand readily implies\nas the conserved Noether currents of the model under the global U (N ) symmetry.\nTo construct the conserved tower of currents, we closely follow the inductive procedure\nof [7]. Let us first define the covariant derivative D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + A\u03bc . Due to (2.3), it satisfies\n[D\u03bc , D\u03bd ] = 0 ,\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u2202\u03bc D \u03bc = D \u03bc \u2202\u03bc .\n\n(2.5)\n\nand due to (2.2), we further have\n(n)\n\nLet us now suppose that we have found the conserved current J\u03bc at level n. By Hodge\ndecomposition of differential forms, which applies in the present NC spacetime A\u03b8 (R(1+1) )\nas the algebra of derivatives are not deformed (i.e. derivatives commute), this implies that\nwe can find \u03c7(n) \u2208 A\u03b8 (R1+1 ) \u2297 M at(N ) such that\nJ\u03bc(n) = \u2212\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd \u03c7(n) ,\n\nn \u2265 1,\n\n(2.6)\n\nThen, the (n + 1)th current is\nJ\u03bc(n+1) = D\u03bc \u03c7(n) ,\n(1)\n\nThe construction starts with \u03c7(0) = 1 and J\u03bc\nconserved since\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(n+1)\n\noether . We can see that J\n= AN\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n\u2202 \u03bc J\u03bc(n+1) = D\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc \u03c7(n) ,\n=\n\n(2.7)\n\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bc J\u03bd(n)\n\nis\n\nn\u22651\n\n= \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bc D\u03bd \u03c7(n\u22121) = 0 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere we have used (2.4), (2.5) and (2.6). Thus, the construction of [7] works for the\nnoncommutative principal chiral model too. As we have already stated in the introduction,\nthis result overlaps with that of [28].\n1\n\nNote that H can not be taken in the Fock basis due to the Minkowski signature.\n\n3\n\n\fThe form of the conserved currents allows us to define the linear system of equations for\nP\n\u2212n \u03c7n , we can write using (2.6)\nthis model. Introducing a spectral parameter \u03bb via \u03c7 = \u221e\n0 \u03bb\nand (2.7) that\n\u2212 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd \u03c7 = \u03bb\u22121 D\u03bc \u03c7 .\n(2.9)\nThe last equation can be brought into the form\n\u2212 \u22021 \u03c7\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u22020 \u03c7\n\n=\n\n\u03bbA0 + A1\n\u03c7,\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2\n\u03bbA1 + A0\n\u03c7.\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2\n\n(2.10)\n\nObviously, the system of equations in (2.10) is of the same form as that of the commutative\nmodel. However, we note that A\u03bc (x\u0302\u03bc ), \u03c7(x\u0302\u03bc , \u03bb) are operators in A\u03b8 (R1+1 ) \u2297 M at(N ) acting\non the Hilbert space H \u2297 CN .

[38]. In this article, a generalized zero-curvature representation consisting\nof an appropriate curvature free connection together with a covariantly conserved vector field\nhas been formulated. The generalized zero-curvature representation implies the presence of\nconserved currents which may be obtained in a systematic manner. In several diverse models\nof interest admitting this representation, it has been found that the conserved currents are\ninfinite in number leading to their integrability. For instance, in certain submodels of the\nprincipal chiral models and CP N models in 2 + 1 dimensions, which are determined by the\nrequirement of additional equations to be satisfied by the fields over and above the equations\nof motions of their respective parent models, an infinite tower of conserved currents has been\nobtained explicitly using the generalized zero curvature representation [38, 39, 40, 41]. In\nanother example in 3 + 1 dimensions considered by Aratyn et. al. [42], a full field theory\npossesing toroidal solitonic solutions has been shown to be integrable using the generalized\nzero-curvature representation and its conserved currents have been constructed.\nA parallel approach to that of [38] has been developed by Fujii et. al. [43]. In this\nformulation, for instance the CP N submodels are studied by implementing their defining\nconditions as additional equations to be satisfied by the projectors of the CP N models,\nrather than on their particular parametrizations. This approach appears to be better suited\nfor adapting to the present setting of noncommutative theories and will be followed in this\nsection. However, before doing so, it seems instructive to briefly sketch how the ideas of [38]\n5\n\n\ffit into the current framework, and state the type of limitation it faces, in providing explicit\nexpressions for the conserved quantities.\nSuppose that we have a finite-dimensional non-semi-simple Lie algebra \u011c. Then we can\nwrite \u011c = G + I where G is a semisimple Lie subalgebra of \u011c and I is its maximal solvable\nideal (i.e. radical). We can consider now a connection one-form A\u03bc on A\u03b8 (R2+1 ) valued in\nG, and an antisymmetric tensor B\u03bc\u03bd valued in I. In 2 + 1 dimensions we can write the dual\nof B\u03bc\u03bd as\n1\nB\u0303 \u03bc = \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 B\u03bd\u03c1 .\n(3.1)\n2\nA generalized set of integrability conditions can then be given as [38]\nD\u03bc B\u0303 \u03bc = 0 ,\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd = [D\u03bc , D\u03bd ] = 0 ,\n\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + A\u03bc .\n\n(3.2)\n\nSince A\u03bc is a flat connection we can write\nA = g\u22121 \u2202\u03bc g ,\n\ng\u2208G\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere G is the Lie group whose Lie algebra is G. From these considerations, it is easy to\nverify that the currents\nJ\u03bc = g\u22121 B\u0303\u03bc g ,\n(3.4)\nare conserved. To construct these currents explicitly in a model with say G \u2261 SU (2),\none essentially needs a suitable local parametrization of SU (2). (See. for instance. the\nconstruction of the CP 1 submodel currents in commutative space given in [38].) However,\nsuch a parametrization of SU (2) does not exist in the noncommutative setting, and thus the\nabove construction remains implicit for the currents.\nLet us now turn to applying the methods of [43], and to be more concrete consider a CP 1\nsubmodel in A\u03b8 (R2+1 ). With P \u2208 A\u03b8 (R2+1 ) \u2297 M at(2) we observe that the tensor product\n[over A\u03b8 (R2+1 )] P \u2297 P is a projector in A\u03b8 (R2+1 ) \u2297 M at(22 ). Then the submodel we are\ninterested in may be specified by the equation [43]\n[P \u2297 P , \u2202\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc P \u2297 P ] = 0 ,\n\n\u03bc = 0, 1, 2 .\n\n(3.5)\n\nIn (3.5) and what follows the derivatives on k-fold tensor products are given via\n\u2202\u03bc \u2261\n\nk\u22121\nX\ni\n\n* * * \u2297 1} ,\n1| \u2297 1 {z\n\u2297 * * * \u2297} \u2202\u03bc \u2297 |1 \u2297 1{z\ni\n\n(3.6)\n\nk\u22121\u2212j\n\nand the same symbol is used in the tensor product space, as there is no risk of confusion.\nIt is easy to find that (3.5) can be expressed as the two equations\n[P , \u2202\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc P ] = 0 ,\n\u03bc\n\n(3.7)\n\u03bc\n\n\u2202 P \u2297 [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] + [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] \u2297 \u2202 P = 0 .\n\n(3.8)\n\nCP 1\n\nClearly, the first of these is the equation of motion for the\nmodel, while (3.8) puts\nfurther restrictions on the projector P and thereby specifies a submodel. Using (2.15), we\nmay also express these conditions as\n1\n1\nu\u2020 \u2202\u03bc u = 0 , \u2202\u03bc u \u2020\nu\u2020 \u2202\u03bc u = 0 .\n(3.9)\n\u2202\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc u \u2212 2\u2202\u03bc u \u2020\nu u+1\n(u u + 1)2\nIn the commutative limit these equations collapse to \u2202 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc u = 0 and \u2202\u03bc u\u2202 \u03bc u = 0, which\ndefine the submodel in the commutative space [38].\n6\n\n\f3.1.\n\nConserved Currents:\n\nIn close analogy to the commutative model [43], the conserved matrix currents in this model\ncan now be constructed. They are given by\nJ\u03bck =\n\nk\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n* * * \u2297 P} \u2297[P , \u2202\u03bc P ] \u2297 P\n* * * \u2297 P} .\n|P \u2297 P{z\n| \u2297 P{z\ni\n\n(3.10)\n\nk\u22121\u2212i\n\nIt follows from (3.7) and (3.8) that J\u03bck is conserved:\n\u2202 \u03bc J\u03bck = 0 .\n\n(3.11)\n\nFor instance, at level k = 3 we have\n\u2202 \u03bc J\u03bck=3 = \u2202 \u03bc [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] \u2297 P \u2297 P + \u2202 \u03bc P \u2297 [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] \u2297 P + [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] \u2297 \u2202 \u03bc P \u2297 P\n\n+ P \u2297 \u2202 \u03bc [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] \u2297 P + P \u2297 \u2202 \u03bc P \u2297 [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] + P \u2297 [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] \u2297 \u2202 \u03bc P\n\n+ P \u2297 P \u2297 \u2202 \u03bc [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] + [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] \u2297 P \u2297 \u2202\u03bc P + \u2202 \u03bc P \u2297 P \u2297 [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] = 0 . (3.12)\nupon using (3.7) and (3.8).\nA few simple comments are in order. Clearly, level k = 1 in the above construction\ncorresponds to the NC CP 1 model and from (3.10) we recover the Noether currents of the\nmodel, as given in (2.17, 2.18, 2.19, 2.20), where now the index \u03bc in these equations run from\n0 to 2. Next, we observe that all the results above go through for the NC CP N model, once\nM at(22 ) is replaced by M at((N + 1)2 ). We can ask, how many conserved currents are there\nat a given level k? For the CP 1 model, we have four conserved currents at level k = 1, and\n2k \u00d7 2k conserved current at level k, and for the CP N model we have (N + 1)k \u00d7 (N + 1)k\nconserved currents at level k. Clearly, the number of conserved currents tends to infinity as\nk does so.\nA fast way to compute the component currents is to take the trace of the product of J\u03bck\nwith elements of a suitably chosen basis. Let us illustrate this for the simplest case k = 2.\nIn this case the tensor product space is M at(4) and it can be spanned by the basis\n\u039bab = \u03bba \u2297 \u03bbb ,\n\n\u03bba = (12 , \u03bb+ , \u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb3 ).\n\n(3.13)\n\nUsing the identity TrA \u2297 B = TrA TrB, we can write\n(J\u03bck=2 )ab = Tr4 \u039bab J\u03bck=2\n= Tr4 \u03bba \u2297 \u03bbb ([P , \u2202\u03bc P ] \u2297 P + P \u2297 [P , \u2202\u03bc P ])\n\n= Tr2 \u03bba [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] Tr2 \u03bbb P + Tr2 \u03bba P Tr2 \u03bbb [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] .\n\n(3.14)\n\nThe 16 conserved currents present at this level can be obtained from (3.14).

Equation (3.7), being the quadratic field equation for the CP 1 model, is automatically satisfied\nby P fulfilling either of the two equations in (3.18). As for (3.8) taking for instance the\nanti-self-dual configurations we have\n(3.8) = \u2212\u2202z P \u2297 \u2202z\u0304 P P + \u2202z\u0304 P \u2297 P \u2202z P + P \u2202z P \u2297 \u2202z\u0304 P \u2212 \u2202z\u0304 P P \u2297 \u2202z P ,\n\n(3.21)\n\nand it vanishes identically upon using the second equation in (3.18) and its Hermitian conjugate. Clearly, a similar calculation holds for the self-dual solution too.\n4.\n4.1.\n\nSupersymmetric Nonlinear Models\nNoncommutative SUSY Principal Chiral Model:\n\nLet us now focus our attention to the N = 1 superspace A\u03b8 (R1+1 |2 ) with Moyal-type noncommutativity, i.e.\n[x\u0302\u03bc , x\u0302\u03bd ] = i\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n{\u03b8\u03b1 , \u03b8\u03b2 } = 0 ,\n\n[x\u0302\u03bc , \u03b8\u03b1 ] = 0 ,\n8\n\n\u03bc , \u03bd = 0, 1 ,\n\n\u03b1 , \u03b2 = 1, 2 .\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fThe supersymmetric principal chiral model is given by the action\nZ\n1\nS = \u03c0\u03b8\nd2 \u03b8 Tr D\u0304G\u2020 DG ,\n4\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere the SUSY covariant derivative is\nD\u03b1 =\n\n\u2202\n+ i(\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b8)\u03b1 \u2202\u03bc\n\u03b1\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304\n\n(4.3)\n\nand G = G(x\u03bc , \u03b8\u03b1 ) is a matrix valued superfield in NC space with GG\u2020 = 1 = G\u2020 G. For\ndefiniteness we will assume that G \u2208 U (N ).\nFor the \u03b3 matrices we take\n!\n!\n!\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\u03b30 =\n, \u03b31 =\n, \u03b35 = \u03b31\u03b32 =\n.\n(4.4)\n\u22121 0\n1 0\n0 \u22121\nIt may be noted that {D1 , D2 } = 0, and the commutators of D\u03b1 with the generators of\nPoincar\u00e9 algebra are the same as those without noncommutativity, therefore the full SUSY\nalgebra is present and is undeformed.\nWe will now demonstrate that this model satisfies a zero-curvature condition and is\ntherefore integrable at the classical level and construct its conserved nonlocal currents. Our\napproach is the superspace generalization of that of [7] and was used by Chau and Yen [20]\nto construct the nonlocal charges in SUSY principal chiral models with or without the WZW\nterm.\nThe equation of motion that follows from the variation of (4.3) is\nD\u0304(G\u2020 DG) = 0 .\n\n(4.5)\n\nLet us define a gauge superfield as A\u03b1 = G\u2020 D\u03b1 G. Then (4.5) becomes\nD1 A2 \u2212 D2 A1 = 0 .\n\n(4.6)\n\nFurthermore, we have the gauge covariant derivative D\u03b1 = D\u03b1 + A\u03b1 , which immediately\nleads to zero-curvature for A\u03b1 :\n{D1 , D2 } = D1 A2 + D2 A1 + {A1 , A2 } = 0 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nThis condition together with (4.5) implies that the model is integrable. As a consequence of\nthe equation of motion the identity\n{D\u03b1 , D\u0304\u03b1 } = 0\n\n(4.8)\n\nholds.\nIt is now easy to construct the nonlocal conserved currents. Suppose that we have found\n(n)\nthe conserved current J\u03b1 at level n. This implies that we can find \u03be (n) \u2208 A\u03b8 (R1+1 |2 ) \u2297\nM at(N ) such that\n(n)\n(n)\nJ1 = \u2212D1 \u03be (n) , J2 = D2 \u03be (n) .\n(4.9)\nThen, the (n + 1)th current is\nJ\u03b1(n+1) = D\u03b1 \u03be (n) ,\n9\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(4.10)\n\n\f(1)\n\n(n+1)\n\nThe construction starts with \u03be (0) = 1 and J\u03b1 = A\u03b1 . We can see that J\u03b1\n(n+1)\n\nD1 J2\n\nis conserved\n\n(n+1)\n\n\u2212 D2 J1\n\n= D1 D2 \u03be (n) \u2212 D2 D1 \u03be (n)\n\n= \u2212D2 D1 \u03be (n) + D1 D2 \u03be (n)\n(n)\n\n= D2 J1\n\n(n)\n\n+ D1 J2\n\n= D2 D1 \u03be (n\u22121) + D1 D2 \u03be (n\u22121)\n\n= {D1 , D2 }\u03be (n\u22121) = 0 .\n\nIntroducing a spectral parameter \u03ba and writing \u03be =\nfrom (4.9) and (4.10) that\n\nP\n\nn (n)\nn\u03ba \u03be\n\n(4.11)\nwith \u03be (0) = 1, we find\n\n\u03ba\nA1 \u03be ,\n1+\u03ba\n\u03ba\nA2 \u03be\n1\u2212\u03ba\n\nD1 \u03be = \u2212\nD2 \u03be =\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhich is precisely of the same form as in the commutative space, but now A\u03b1 and \u03be are\noperators in A\u03b8 (R1+1 |2 ) \u2297 M at(N ).\n4.2.\n\nAddition of the WZW term:\n\nThe supersymmetric WZW term is of the form [44, 45]\nZ\ndG\nk\n2\u03c0\u03b8 d2 \u03b8 dt Tr G\u2020\nD\u0304G\u2020 \u03b35 DG ,\nSW ZW =\n16\u03c0\ndt\nwhere k \u2208 Z. The variation of the total action S = SP C + SW ZW yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk\n\u2020\nD\u0304 (1 + \u03b35 )G DG = 0.\n\u03c0\n\n(4.13)\n\n(4.14)\n\nWe observe that all the results of the previous section hold, if we make the substitution\nA\u03bc \u2212\u2192 (1 \u2212\n\nk\n)A\u03bc .\n\u03c0\n\n(4.15)\n\nThus, we conclude that all the classical integrability properties are possessed by the NC\nsupersymmetric WZW model too.\n4.3.\n\nSUSY CP 1 Model:\n\nThe SUSY CP 1 on A\u03b8 (R1+1 |2 ) model is specified by\nG = ei\u03c0P = 1 \u2212 2P ,\n\nP2 = P ,\n\nP \u2261 P(x\u0302\u03bc , \u03b8\u03b1 ) \u2208 A\u03b8 (R1+1 |2 ) \u2297 M at(2) .\n\n(4.16)\n\nIts equation of motion is then,\n1\n(D + D\u0304)[P , (D \u2212 D\u0304)P] = [P , D\u0304DP] = 0 ,\n2\n10\n\n(4.17)\n\n\fand the associated conserved currents are given via the spinorial superfield\nJ\u03b1 = [P , (D\u03b1 \u2212 D\u0304\u03b1 )P] .\n\n(4.18)\n\nIt is instructive to present the Noether currents precisely. These are obtained through the\n(\u03b3 \u03bc )\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b8\u03b2 component j\u03bc of J\u03b1 . The remaining components of J\u03b1 in the Grassmann expansion,\ndo not imply any further conservation laws in general. Expanding P in powers of \u03b8 we have\nP = P + i\u03b81 \u03c82 \u2212 i\u03b82 \u03c81 + i\u03b81 \u03b82 F ,\n\n(4.19)\n\nwith P 2 = P implying P 2 = P , P \u03c8\u03b1 P = 0 and F = i[\u03c81 , \u03c82 ]. Using (4.19), we find\nj\u03bc = [P , \u2202\u03bc P ] + i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8 .\n\n(4.20)\n\nWe recognize the bosonic part as the Noether currents of the NC CP 1 model, and the\nfermionic part as those of the NC Gross-Neveu model.\n4.4.\n\nA SUSY CP 1 Submodel:\n\nWe now consider a SUSY CP 1 submodel in A\u03b8 (R2+1 |2 ). Extending the discussion of section\n3 by including the supersymmetry, we consider the condition\n[P \u2297 P , D\u0304DP \u2297 P] = 0 ,\n\n(4.21)\n\nas the defining relation for the SUSY CP 1 submodel.\nOn k-fold tensor products D is given by\nD=\n\nk\u22121\nX\ni\n\n* * * \u2297 1} .\n\u2297 * * * \u2297} D \u2297 |1 \u2297 1{z\n|1 \u2297 1 {z\ni\n\n(4.22)\n\nk\u22121\u2212j\n\nand likewise for D\u0304. We further have that\n\n(D\u0304 \u2297 1 + 1 \u00d7 D\u0304)(D \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 D)\n\n= D\u0304D \u2297 1 + D\u0304 \u2297 D \u2212 D \u2297 D\u0304 + 1 \u2297 D\u0304D ,\n\n(4.23)\n\nthe minus sign in the third term is due to the odd gradings of D and D\u0304.\nA short calculation shows that (4.21) is equivalent to the two equations\n[P , D\u0304DP] = 0 ,\n\nD\u0304P \u2297 [P , DP] + [P , D\u0304P] \u2297 DP = 0 .\n\n(4.24)\n\nFollowing the steps of section 3, we define\nJ\u03b1k =\n\nk\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\nP\n* * * \u2297 P} \u2297[P , (D\u03b1 \u2212 D\u0304\u03b1 )P] \u2297 |P \u2297 P{z\n* * * \u2297 P} .\n| \u2297 P{z\ni\n\nDue to (4.24), J\u03b1k are conserved:\n\n(4.25)\n\nk\u22121\u2212i\n\n(D + D\u0304)J k = 0 ,\n\n11\n\n(4.26)\n\n\fas can be checked explicitly for any given k.

The matrix components of\nj\u03bck may also be obtained using the simple procedure outlined in (3.13), (3.14).\nThe remaining components of J\u03b1k do not in general imply any new conservation laws.\n\n4.5.\n\nSolutions to the Submodel:\n\nThe static solitonic solutions of the SUSY CP 1 model are well known [46]. We can obtain\ntheir noncommutative versions in a straightforward manner. They are given by the BPS\nconfigurations fulfilling\nPD\u2212 P = 0 ,\n\n(self-dual) ,\n\nPD+ P = 0 ,\n\nwhere the supersymmetric covariant derivatives D\u00b1 =\n\n\u03b81\u221a\n\u00b1i\u03b82\n.\n2\n\n(D1 \u00b1iD2 )\n\u221a\n2\n\nare given as\n\n(4.28)\n2\n\n\u221a\nD\u2212 = \u2202\u03b8+ + i 2\u03b8+ \u2202z ,\n\n\u221a\nD+ = \u2202\u03b8\u2212 + i 2\u03b8\u2212 \u2202z\u0304 ,\nwith \u03b8\u00b1 =\n\n(anti-self-dual) ,\n\n(4.29)\n\nThey fulfil\n\u221a\n2\nD+\n= i 2\u2202z\u0304 ,\n\n\u221a\n2\nD\u2212\n= i 2\u2202z ,\n\n{D+ , D\u2212 } = 0.\n\n(4.30)\n\nIn powers of the Grassmann variables, P expands to\nP = P \u2212 \u03b8+ \u03c8\u2212 + \u03b8\u2212 \u03c8+ \u2212 \u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 F ,\n\n(4.31)\n\nand P 2 = P implies:\nP2 = P ,\n\nP \u03c8\u00b1 P = 0 ,\n\nF = \u2212[\u03c8+ , \u03c8\u2212 ] .\n\n(4.32)\n\nAfter using the constraints (4.32), the component form of the self-dual equation in (4.28) can\nbe cast into the equations:\nP \u2202z P = 0 ,\n\nP \u03c8\u2212 = 0 ,\n\nP F \u03c8\u2212 = 0 ,\n\nP \u2202z \u03c8+ \u2212 \u03c8+ \u2202z P = 0 .\n\n(4.33)\n\nFrom (4.33) it is readily observed that the bosonic part of the solution is the BPS solution\nof the NC CP 1 model (2.15). It is then easy to see that the self-dual solutions are given by\n!\n1\n1\n\u2020\np\nP = \u03c7\u03c7 , \u03c7 =\n, \u03c7\u2020 \u03c7 = 1 .\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\nu(z) \u2212 \u03b8+ \u03c6(z)\nu u \u2212 \u03b8+ u \u03c6 \u2212 i\u03b8\u2212 u\u03c6 + i\u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 \u03c6 \u03c6 + 1\n(4.34)\n2\n\nIn this subsection, we are using the Euclidean gamma matrices\n!\n!\n0 1\n1\n0\n2\n1\n, \u03b35 = \u03b31\u03b32 =\n, \u03b3 =\n\u03b3 =\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n12\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n1\n0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n\fThe remaining component matrices \u03c8\u00b1 and F can be read off by differentiating P with\nrespect to \u03b8\u00b1 .\nWe can see that these configurations solve our submodel. Clearly, first of the equations\nin (4.24) is automatically satisfied by the BPS equations (4.28). As for the second equation\nin (4.24), picking the self-dual configuration we have\n\u2212 D+ P \u2297 D\u2212 PP \u2212 D\u2212 P \u2297 PD+ P + PD+ P \u2297 D\u2212 P + D\u2212 PP \u2297 D+ P ,\n\n(4.35)\n\nwhich vanishes identically, after using D\u00b1 P = D\u00b1 PP + PD\u00b1 P together with the self-duality\nequation. A similar calculation holds for the anti-self-dual case. Thus (4.34) constitute a set\nof solutions for the submodel under investigation.\n5.\n\nConclusions and Outlook\n\nIn this paper, classical integrability properties of nonlinear field theories on the GroenewoldMoyal type noncommutative spaces have been studied. We have obtained the infinite tower\nof conserved currents in the noncommutative principal chiral model and CP 1 model and their\nsupersymmetric extensions by employing an inductive procedure, which is well known in the\ncorresponding commutative theories. In particular, the explicit expressions for the Noether\ncurrents of the noncommutative CP 1 model, which differ from those of the commutative\nmodel, have been presented. We have also constructed noncommutative extensions of a CP 1\nsubmodel [on A\u03b8 (R2+1 )], as well as its SUSY extension [on A\u03b8 (R2+1 |2 )], and proved their\nclassical integrability by systematically obtaining their infinitely many conserved currents.\nIn the CP 1 submodel, a simple method to work out the explicit forms of the higher degree\ncurrents is given and it is applied on a few examples to reveal their structure. The solitonic\nsolutions of the submodels are also studied, and they are shown to be the same as the BPS\nconfigurations of their parent models. We think that it may be worthwhile to explore the\npossible connections of the CP 1 submodel to the U (2) Ward model [33] and their SUSY\nextensions. It is also interesting to note that there is yet another integrable CP 1 submodel,\nwhich is defined through a weaker integrability condition [47]. (Similar results in the context\nof the CP N model in four dimensions are also known [48].) It would be desirable to study its\nnoncommutative extension as well. Progress on these topics will help us to further enhance\nour understanding of integrability in A\u03b8 (R2+1 ) and A\u03b8 (R2+1 |2 ). We hope to report on the\ndevelopments on these and related topics in the near future.\nAcknowledgements\nI thank O.
