We consider Morawetz estimates for weighted energy decay of solutions to the wave equation on scattering manifolds (i.e., those with large\nconic ends). We show that a Morawetz estimate persists for solutions that\nare localized at low frequencies, independent of the geometry of the compact\npart of the manifold. We further prove a new type of Morawetz estimate in\nthis context, with both hypotheses and conclusion localized inside the forward\nlight cone. This result allows us to gain a 1/2 power of t decay relative to\nwhat would be dictated by energy estimates, in a small part of spacetime.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper, we show that the celebrated Morawetz estimate [14], expressing\ndispersion of solutions to the wave equation, holds for low-frequency solutions on\na wide class of manifolds with asymptotically flat ends. We also generalize the\nestimate to a local-in-spacetime estimate inside the forward light cone.\nIt is well known that the decay of energy of a solution to \u0003u = 0 at high frequencies is closely tied to the geometry of geodesic rays; in particular, the existence\nof trapped geodesics is an obstruction to the uniform decay of local energy (see\nRalston [18]). Many subsequent results have demonstrated that the decay of high\nfrequency components of the solution persists in a wide variety of geometric settings\nin which there is no trapping of rays (see e.g. [15], [20], [21]).\nOn the other hand, the low-frequency behavior of the solutions is both more\nrobust and less studied. Intuitively, long wavelengths should be sensitive only to\nthe crudest aspects of the geometric setting, and in particular, trapping should\nnot be an obstacle to decay. In this paper, we work in the setting of scattering\nmanifolds, i.e., we assume that the manifold1 X has ends resembling the large ends\nof cones, with the metric taking the form\n(1.1)\n\ng = dr2 + r2 h(r\u22121 , dy)\n\nDate: October 28, 2018.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge partial support from the NSF under grant numbers DMS0801226 (AV) and DMS-0700318, DMS-1001463 (JW).

The authors are grateful to Daniel Tataru, and to\nan anonymous referee, for many helpful comments, and in particular for suggesting the refined\nl\u221e \u2013l1 version of the estimates in Theorem 1.1.\n1We remark that in the body of the paper, X will refer to the manifold with boundary given\nby compactifying such a space.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nANDRAS VASY AND JARED WUNSCH\n\nwhere the noncompact ends are diffeomorphic to (1, \u221e)r \u00d7 Y, with Y a smooth\nmanifold, and where h is a family (in r) of metrics on Y.2 Our two main theorems\ndemonstrate the insensitivity of the low-energy behavior of the wave equation to\ngeometry on all but the largest scales. We also allow long-range perturbations of\nthe metrics (1.1); see Section 2 for the precise definitions.\nThe results in this paper are as follows. To begin with, we state a result holding\nfor low frequency solutions in spatial dimension n \u2265 4 that generalizes the standard\nMorawetz estimate. We fix a cutoff function \u03c8 \u2208 Cc\u221e ((0, \u221e)). Let \u03a8H denote the\nfrequency-localization operator\n\u03a8H = \u03c8(H 2 (\u2206g + V )).\nWe assume that the function r, appearing in the end structure of the metric (1.1),\nis extended to be a globally defined, smooth function on X, with min(r) \u2265 2 (so we\nmay take log r with impunity). Let \u03c70 , \u03c71 be a partition of unity with \u03c71 supported\nin r > R \u226b 0, hence in the ends in which the product decomposition (1.1) applies.\nHere and throughout the paper, k\u2022k will refer to the norm in the space L2 (X, dg).\nWhen we employ spacetime norms in \u00a74 we will employ distinct notation k\u2022kM\nwhere M is (the compactification of) the spacetime R \u00d7 X.\nTheorem 1.1. Let X be a scattering manifold of dimension n \u2265 4 with a longrange metric, as in (2.1)\u2013(2.2), and let V \u2265 0 be a symbol of order \u22122 \u2212 \u03bd, \u03bd > 0.\nLet u be a solution to the inhomogeneous wave equation\n(\u0003 + V )u = f,\non Rt \u00d7 X, with initial data\n\nu|t=0 = u0 \u2208 H 1 ,\n\nThen for H sufficiently large,\nZ \u221e\u0010\nr\u22123/2 \u03a8H u\n\n2\n\nf \u2208 L1 (R; L2 (X))\n\u2202t u|t=0 = v0 \u2208 L2 .\n\n+ \u03c71 (log r)\u22121 r\u22121/2 \u2202r \u03a8H u\n\n2\n\n0\n\n(1.2)\n\n+ \u03c71 r\u22123/2 \u2207Y \u03a8H u\nZ \u221e\n\u00012\n.

The result thus shows that the dispersive effects of the large scale scattering geometry always hold for low-frequency solutions, regardless of trapping or\nother local features. We further remark that we could replace the L1 (R; L2 (X))\nnorm on f on the RHS of the estimate by\nZ \u221e\n2\n(1.3)\n(r2 + t2 )1/4 log(r2 + t2 )f dt,\n0\n\nif desired, to obtain a weighted L2 spacetime norm instead.\nFollowing the suggestion of an anonymous referee, we are in fact able to prove a\nrefined version of this result, with logarithmic losses replaced by estimates in l1 and\nl\u221e norms on energy in dyadic spatial shells.

Let X be a scattering manifold of dimension n \u2265 3 with a longrange metric as in (2.1)\u2013(2.2), V \u2265 0 a symbol of order \u22122 \u2212 \u03bd, \u03bd > 0. Let\n(\u0003 + V )u = f.\n\nSuppose that \u03b4 < 1 and\n\u2207\u03a8H u \u2208 t\u03ba L2 (\u03a9), f \u2208 r\u22121/2 t\u03ba\u22121/2 L2 (\u03a9), \u03ba \u2208 R.\n\nThen for H sufficiently large,\n\n\u2207\u03a8H u \u2208 t\u03ba (r/t)\u03c3 L2 (\u03a9), \u03a8H u \u2208 t\u03ba r(r/t)\u03c3 L2 (\u03a9)\n\nfor 0 < \u03c3 < 1/2.\nIn particular, if K is compact in X \u25e6 , then on R \u00d7 K, \u03a8H u, \u2207\u03a8H u are in\n\u03ba\u22121/2+\u01eb 2\nt\nL (R \u00d7 X) for every \u01eb > 0 (for H sufficiently large).\nThis theorem gives almost half an order of decay as compared to the a priori\nassumption, but only in a small part of space-time. Indeed, for any \u03b40 > 0, the\nconclusion in r/t > \u03b40 is the same as hypothesis, so in particular \u03b4 in the statement\nof the theorem can be taken arbitrarily small without losing the strength of the\nconclusion. Thus, Theorem 1.2 really amounts to a regularity statement; it is a\nclose analogue of the statement for hyperbolic PDE that over compact sets, one\nhas extra regularity over a priori space-time Sobolev regularity (square integrability\ncan be replaced by continuity along the flow). Indeed, an analogous statement is\nthat locally L2 solutions of the wave equation in space time, near t = 0, are in t\u03c3 L2\nlocally for \u03c3 \u2208 (0, 1/2); this follows from continuity in time with values in L2 and\nthe fact that t\u2212\u03c3 is in L2 (R) locally.\nOne virtue of this version of the Morawetz estimate, and even more of the approach to obtaining this estimate, is that they hold the promise of applying quite\nbroadly, in non-product spacetimes. Even in the present inhomogeneous form they\ncan be used to study the wave equation for metrics which arise by perturbing the\nMinkowski metric near infinity in the following way: pick pj , j = 1, . . . , N , on the\nn+1\nsphere at infinity, Sn = \u2202Rn+1\n= Rt \u00d7 Rnz\nt,z , in the radial compactification of R\nwhich lie in the interior of the forward light cone. Blow up the pj ; if one of the pj is\nthe \"north pole,\" corresponding to z = 0, t = +\u221e, a neighborhood of the front face\ncan be identified with a neighborhood of \"temporal infinity\" in the product asymptotically Euclidean space-time (see Section 4); the other pj can be transformed to\nthis via isometries of Minkowski space-time. Thus, if the Minkowski metric is perturbed in a way corresponding to the local product structure these transformations\ninduce, modulo decaying terms in time, the local Morawetz estimate is applicable\nby treating the decaying terms as inhomogeneities. In future work, we plan to\naddress such non-product geometries more systematically.\nBy the standard energy estimate, if (\u0003 + V )u = 0 and u is in the energy space,\nthen for \u03c6 \u2208 Cc\u221e (R),\n\u03c6(r/t)\u2207u \u2208 t1/2+\u03b4 L2 (R \u00d7 X), \u03b4 > 0.\n\nThis observation immediately yields\n\nCorollary 1.3. Let X, g, and V be as in Theorem 1.2.

Let K \u2282 X \u25e6\nbe compact. Then Corollary 1.3 specializes to show:\nCorollary 1.4.

We\nmust thus introduce cutoffs, which in turn introduce terms in the commutator that\nhave to be treated as errors. At high frequency, these errors are disastrous, but at\nlow frequency, we may employ a Poincar\u00e9/Hardy inequality to control them. Further technical subtleties arise in estimating remainder terms from the commutator,\napplied to \u03a8H u. These estimates are among the principal technical innovations\nhere-see Proposition 2.1 below.\nThe proof of Theorem 1.2 uses a slightly different commutator argument (formally a \"commutator\" rather than a \"multiplier\" in the usual parlance) that occurs\nin space-time. The localizer in the cone \u03a9 multiplies a Morawetz-like commutant\nwith a positive weight in r but decay in t; derivatives of the cutoff are controlled\nby the a priori decay assumptions, namely \u2207\u03a8H u|\u03a9 \u2208 t\u03ba L2 (R \u00d7 X), which in the\ncorollaries are implied by energy estimates.\nRelated results have recently been pursued by a number of authors in the setting\nof asymptotically Euclidean manifolds. Bony-H\u00e4fner [1] explored Mourre estimates\non asymptotically Euclidean spaces at low energy, while both Bouclet [3] and BonyH\u00e4fner [2] have recently obtain iterated resolvent estimates in the low frequency\nregime sufficient to prove strong weighted decay estimates for asymptotically Euclidean metrics. These results yield stronger decay than what is obtained here, but\nin a narrower class of geometries and at the cost of a more intricate argument which\n\n\f6\n\nANDRAS VASY AND JARED WUNSCH\n\ninvolves first proving resolvent estimates; one of the virtues of the techniques used\nhere is the direct use of the hyperbolic equation, apart from the estimates necessary to localize at low energy. More in the spirit of our approach, Metcalfe-Tataru\nhave proved an analogous theorem to our Theorem 1.1 for small perturbations of\nEuclidean space, and Tataru [19] has also proved strong energy decay estimates in\na class of 3 + 1-dimensional Lorentz metrics that includes the Schwarzschild and\nKerr spacetimes; see also the more recent [13]. (There has been considerable work\non these specific Lorentzian examples motivated by problems in general relativity;\nwe will not review that literature here.) The only prior results on low energy estimates in the setting of general scattering manifolds, in addition to the authors' [22],\nis the recent work of Guillarmou-Hassell-Sikora [6], which employs a sophisticated\nlow-energy parametrix construction to obtain strong decay estimates. Due to the\nnature of the construction, the requirements on the metric in [6] are more stringent\nthan the long-range assumptions used here.\nMany of the low-frequency estimates used in this paper were first developed by\nthe authors in [22] following the results of Bony-H\u00e4fner [1] in the asymptotically\nEuclidean setting, using rather different methods.\nWe have discussed both low- and high-frequency estimates above; for completeness, we remark that intermediate frequencies (i.e. frequencies in any compact subset of (0, \u221e)) are always well-behaved in that the solution of the wave equation localized to these frequencies decays rapidly inside the forward light cone, in r/t < c < 1.\nThis can be seen easily both by commutator methods (especially tools analogous\nto unreduced 2-body type problems, i.e. Mourre estimates as in the work of Mourre\n[16], Perry, Sigal and Simon [17]), Froese and Herbst [5], or directly using the resolvent of the Laplacian at the continuous spectrum, as described by Hassell and\nthe first author in [7, 8] and the stationary phase lemma.\n2. Conjugated spectral cutoffs\n2.1. Notation and setting. Before stating our results on conjugated spectral\ncutoffs, we very briefly recall the basic definitions of the b- and scattering structures\non a compact n-dimensional manifolds with boundary, denoted X; we refer to [11]\nfor more detail. A boundary defining function x on X is a non-negative C \u221e function\non X whose zero set is exactly \u2202X, and whose differential does not vanish there; a\nuseful example to keep in mind is x = r\u22121 (modified to be smooth at the origin) in\nthe compactification of an asymptotically Euclidean space. We recall that C \u0307\u221e (X),\nwhich may also be called the set of Schwartz functions, is the subset of C \u221e (X)\nconsisting of functions vanishing at the boundary with all derivatives, the dual of\nC \u0307\u221e (X) is tempered distributional densities C \u2212\u221e (X; \u03a9X); tempered distributions\nC \u2212\u221e (X) are elements of the dual of Schwartz densities, C \u0307\u221e (X; \u03a9X).\nLet V(X) be the Lie algebra of all C \u221e vector fields on X; thus V(X) is the set\nof all C \u221e sections of T X. In local coordinates (x, y1 , . . . , yn\u22121 ),\n\u2202x , \u2202y1 , . . . , \u2202yn\u22121\nform a local basis for V(X), i.e. restrictions of elements of V(X) to the coordinate\nchart can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of these vector fields with\nC \u221e coefficients. We next define Vb (X) to be the Lie algebra of C \u221e vector fields\ntangent to \u2202X; in local coordinates\nx\u2202x , \u2202y1 , . . . , \u2202yn\u22121\n\n\fMORAWETZ ESTIMATES FOR THE WAVE EQUATION AT LOW FREQUENCY\n\n7\n\nform a local basis in the same sense. Thus, Vb (X) is the set of all C \u221e sections of a\nbundle, called the b-tangent bundle of X, denoted b T X. Finally, Vsc (X) = xVb (X)\nis the Lie algebra of scattering vector fields;\nx2 \u2202x , x\u2202y1 , . . . , x\u2202yn\u22121\nform a local basis now. Again, Vsc (X) is the set of all C \u221e sections of a bundle,\ncalled the scattering tangent bundle of X, denoted sc T X. We write Diff b (X),\nresp. Diff sc (X), for the algebra of differential operators generated by Vb (X), resp.\nVsc (X), over C \u221e (X); these are thus finite sums of finite products of vector fields\nin Vb (X), resp. Vsc (X), with C \u221e (X) coefficients. The dual bundles of b T X, resp.\nsc\nT X are b T \u2217 X and sc T \u2217 X, and are called the b- and the scattering cotangent\nbundles, respectively; locally they are spanned by\ndx dy1\ndyn\u22121\ndx\n, dy1 , . . . , dyn\u22121 , resp. 2 ,\n,...,\n.\nx\nx\nx\nx\nWe let S k (X), the space of symbols of order k, consist of functions f such that\nxk Lf \u2208 L\u221e (X) for all L \u2208 Diff b (X).\nWe note, in particular, that\nx\u03c1 C \u221e (X) \u2282 S \u2212\u03c1 (X)\nsince Diff b (X) \u2282 Diff(X). As Diff b (X) (a priori acting, say, on tempered distributions) preserves S k (X), and one can extend Diff b (X) and Diff sc (X) by \"generalizing\nthe coefficients:\"\nX\naj Qj : aj \u2208 S k (X), Qj \u2208 Diff m\nS k Diff m\nb (X)},\nb (X) = {\nj\n\nwith the sum being locally finite, and defining S k Diff m\nsc (X) similarly.

Thus, g is a positive definite inner product on\nthe fibers of sc T X; long-range metrics like this were considered in [22]. We refer\nto Section 2 and the beginning of Section 3 of [22] for more details. Note that\nsubstituting r = x\u22121 gives form 1.1 described above when g1 = 0. We let L2 (X)\ndenote the space of functions square integrable with respect to the metric density;\nlocally near a point in the boundary, this is equivalent to using the density\nx\u2212(n+1) dx dy1 . . . dyn\u22121 .\nNote that the vector fields in Vsc (X) are precisely those with bounded length with\nrespect to g. Correspondingly, a typical example of an element of Diff 2sc (X) is\n\n\f8\n\nANDRAS VASY AND JARED WUNSCH\n\nthe Laplace-Beltrami operator, \u2206g = d\u2217 d.

Estimates. In this section we employ some of the results of [22] to obtain the\nfollowing. Let \u03c8 \u2208 Cc\u221e (R) and\n\u03a8H = \u03c8(H 2 (\u2206g + V )),\n\n\u2206 = \u2206g .\n\nProposition 2.1. Suppose n \u2265 3, g and V as in (2.1), (2.2), (2.3). For 0 \u2264 s,\n0 \u2264 \u03c1, s + \u03c1 < min(2, n/2), L \u2208 Diff 1sc (X),\nLxs+\u03c1 \u03a8H x\u2212s \u2264 CH \u2212\u03c1 , H > 1.\n\nWhile the spectral cutoff is in the \"(anti-)semi-classical\" operator H 2 (\u2206g + V )\nwith large parameter, we emphasize that the operator L in the above proposition\nis simply a differential operator without parameter. As first-order scattering differential operators are spanned over C \u221e (X) by x2 \u2202x , \u2202y , and the constant function,\nto prove the proposition, it suffices to check for these particular values of L. Equivalently, we can simply use the vector-valued L = \u2207g , the gradient with respect to\nthe scattering metric, as well as L = 1.\nNote that for \u03c1 = 0 and s = 0 Proposition 2.1 follows automatically from the\nfunctional calculus and elliptic regularity; for \u03c1 = 0 and s = 1 this is proved in [22],\nhence it follows by interpolation for \u03c1 = 0, 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1. Thus, if \u03c1 = 0, we need to\ndeal with 1 < s < 2 if n \u2265 4, and 1 < s < 3/2 if n = 3.\nNow, with \u03c8\u0303 \u2208 Cc\u221e (C) an almost analytic extension of \u03c8, and\nR(z) = (H 2 (\u2206g + V ) \u2212 z)\u22121\n\nwe have\n(2.4)\n\nLxs+\u03c1 \u03a8H x\u2212s =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u2202 \u03c8\u0303(z)Lxs+\u03c1 R(z)x\u2212s dz dz\u0304.\n\nThus, we only need to obtain uniform bounds on Lxs+\u03c1 R(z)x\u2212s to prove the proposition.\nWe begin with a preliminary lemma, which is an analogue of [22, Proposition 4.3],\nwhere it was proved in the range 0 \u2264 s < 1/2 for n \u2265 3.\nLemma 2.2.

First we prove a result\nfor conjugation by small powers of x (namely, xs , 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1); then in Proposition 2.7 we increase the range. Roughly speaking, the argument of Proposition 2.7\nreduces the weight by 1 (and could be done inductively if Corollaries 2.3 and 2.5 had\nbeen proved for an extended range of weights); Lemma 2.6 deals with the fractional\npart of the weight (and thus would be the base case in the inductive argument).\nLemma 2.6.

We first remark that\n[x2 \u2202x , \u03c6(1/(xt))] = \u2212t\u22121 \u03c6\u2032 (1/(xt)),\n\nwhile xDyj and elements of C \u221e (X) commute with the multiplication operator by\n\u03c6(1/(xt)). Thus, by an inductive argument, for Q \u2208 Diff m\nsc (X), we have\nX\nX\n(2.14) [Q, \u03c6(1/(xt))] =\nfj,\u03b1,k (t)\u03c6j,\u03b1,k (1/(xt))aj,\u03b1,k (x2 Dx )j (xDy )\u03b1\n|\u03b1|+j\u2264m\u22121 k\n\nwhere the sum over k is finite, fj,\u03b1,k \u2208 S \u22121 ([1, \u221e)) (i.e. is C \u221e and is a symbol of\norder \u22121 at infinity), aj,\u03b1,k \u2208 C \u221e (X), \u03c6j,\u03b1,k \u2208 Cc\u221e (R) and supp \u03c6j,\u03b1,k \u2282 supp d\u03c6.\nEquivalently, we may put all of the factors \u03c6j,\u03b1 (1/(xt)) on the right (at the cost of\nchanging these factors as well as the other coefficients), so\nX\nX\n(2.15) [Q, \u03c6(1/(xt))] =\nf \u0303j,\u03b1,k (t)\u00e3j,\u03b1,k (x2 Dx )j (xDy )\u03b1 \u03c6\u0303j,\u03b1,k (1/(xt)),\n|\u03b1|+j\u2264m\u22121 k\n\nwith the tilded objects having the same properties as the untilded ones above.\nFor each t \u2265 1 we may write, L\u03c6(r/t) = \u03c6(r/t)L + [L, \u03c6(r/t)] and use that for\n2\nany Q \u2208 Diff m\nsc (X), Q\u03c8(\u2206 + V ) is bounded on L (by elliptic regularity), so an\nimmediate consequence of (2.14) is that L\u03c6(r/t)\u03c8(\u2206 + V )(1 \u2212 \u03c7(r/t)) is a bounded\noperator on L2 which is uniformly bounded in t \u2265 1; we now must obtain improved\n(decaying) bounds in t.\nTo do so, we work with the resolvent R(z) = (\u2206 + V \u2212 z)\u22121 , Im z 6= 0, and note\nthat if \u03c1 \u2208 Cc\u221e (R) and 1 \u2212 \u03c7 have disjoint support, so \u03c1(1 \u2212 \u03c7) = 0, then commuting\n\u03c1 through the resolvent,\n(2.16)\n\u03c1(1/(xt))R(z)(1 \u2212 \u03c7(1/(xt))) = \u2212[R(z), \u03c1(1/(xt))](1 \u2212 \u03c7(1/(xt)))\n\n= R(z)[\u2206 + V, \u03c1(1/(xt))]R(z)(1 \u2212 \u03c7(1/(xt))).\n\nBy (2.15), this has the form\n(2.17)\nX X\nfj,\u03b1,k (t)R(z)aj,\u03b1,k (x2 Dx )j (xDy )\u03b1 \u03c1j,\u03b1,k (1/(xt))R(z)(1 \u2212 \u03c7(1/(xt))),\n|\u03b1|+j\u22641 k\n\nwith supp \u03c1j,\u03b1,k \u2282 supp d\u03c1. Thus, \u03c1j,\u03b1,k (1/(xt))R(z)(1 \u2212 \u03c7(1/(xt))) is of the same\nform as the left hand side of (2.16), so (2.16) can be further expanded by expanding\nthese last three factors in (2.17) as in (2.16). Note that as we expand, each time\nwe obtain a factor like fj,\u03b1,k \u2208 S \u22121 ([1, \u221e)); these commute with all other factors,\nand after N iterations, the product of these is in S \u2212N ([1, \u221e)). Inductively, doing\nN iterations, we deduce that \u03c6(1/(xt))R(z)(1 \u2212 \u03c7(1/(xt))) is a sum of terms of the\nform\n(2.18)\n\nf (t)R(z)A1 R(z)A2 . . .

First, the rm = x\u2212m in front of \u03c8(\u2206 + V ) is harmless since on the support\nof \u03c6 it is bounded by tm , so it can be absorbed into t\u2212N on the right hand side\nif we increase N. Moreover, for each t, Qxm \u03c8(\u2206 + V )x\u2212m is bounded for Q \u2208\nDiff 1sc (X), as is immediate from the scattering calculus of Melrose as \u03c8(\u2206 + V )\nis a pseudodifferential operator of order \u2212\u221e. However, there is a simple direct\nargument: via the Cauchy-Stokes formula this reduces to a boundedness statement\nfor Qxm R(z)x\u2212m . This in turn is shown by commuting x\u2212m through R(z), much\nas we commuted \u03c6(r/t) above, in this case gaining a power of x (instead of t\u22121 )\neach time we do a commutation, so in m steps we reduce to a product of m + 1\nresolvents and bounded functions, giving a bound\n(2.20)\n\nkQxm R(z)x\u2212m k \u2264 C| Im z|\u2212m\u22121 .\n\nThus, as in the previous proposition, we only need to prove the decaying uniform estimate in t. (Strictly speaking, one has to regularize, replacing x\u2212m by\n(1 + \u01ebx\u22121 )\u2212m x\u2212m , which is bounded for \u01eb > 0, and let \u01eb \u2192 0, in which case the\ncommutator argument presented above gives uniform control of the terms.)\nWe thus proceed as above, so by (2.18) we only need to prove that\nAN \u03c6\u0303(1/(xt))R(z)(1 \u2212 \u03c7(1/(xt)))x\u2212m\nis L2 bounded. As in the fixed t setting, it is convenient to insert a factor of xm on\nthe left, using that x\u2212m . tm on the support of \u03c6\u0303, and thus, commuting \u03c6\u0303 through\nAN , and using the uniform boundedness of \u03c6\u0303 and 1 \u2212 \u03c7 in the sup norm, we are\nreduced to showing that A\u2032N xm R(z)x\u2212m is bounded (with a polynomial bound in\n| Im z|\u22121 ).

Let \u03c60 \u2208 Cc\u221e (R), supported in [\u22122, 2],\nidentically 1 in [\u22121, 1]. With 0 < c < 3\u03b4 < 1 to be fixed, let \u03c6(\u03bc) = \u03c60 (\u03bc/c), and\nlet \u03c6\u0303(\u03bc) = \u03c6(\u03bc/(3\u03b4)). Also, we let \u03c7 be as in Section 3, see the definition just above\n(3.9), so \u03c7 \u2261 1 near infinity. Now, with\nk = 2\u03ba \u2212 1, s = 1 \u2212 2\u03c3,\nlet\nBk,s =\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n\u03c6(r/t)2 \u03c6\u0303(t)2 (r/t)s t\u2212k \u03c7(r)\u2202r \u2212 \u2202r\u2217 \u03c6(r/t)2 \u03c6\u0303(t)2 (r/t)s t\u2212k \u03c7(r) ,\n2\n\nso on the complement of supp(1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03c6\u0303) (where \u03c6\u03c6\u0303 \u2261 1) we actually have\nBk,s = t\u2212k\u2212s As\n\nwith As given by (3.3). Note that supp d\u03c6\u0303\u2229supp \u03c6 is a compact subset of M \u25e6 , so we\ncan effectively ignore terms in which \u03c6\u0303 is commuted through differential operators\nbelow.\nBefore proceeding, we recall that in {r > r0 , t > 1} \u2282 M , Vb (M ) is spanned by\nr\u2202r , t\u2202t and vector fields on Y , over C \u221e (M ). We now blow up the corner \u22022 M ,\nwhere both x = 0 and t\u22121 = 0, to obtain the manifold\nM\u0303 = [M ; \u22022 M ].\nThe blowup procedure (cf. [11, Appendix]; the simple setting of [10, Section 4.1]\nwhere a codimension 2 corner is blown up is analogous to the present case, with\nour t\u22121 taking the place of x\u2032 in [10]) serves to replace the corner t\u22121 = r\u22121 = 0 of\nM by its inward-pointing spherical normal bundle, in this case diffeomorphic to Y\ntimes an interval. This new boundary hypersurface will be denoted4 mf. We let tf\ndenote the \"temporal infinity\" face given by the lift of the set t\u22121 = 0 in M to M\u0303 .\nThe main consequence of the blowup procedure is that it introduces r/t as a smooth\nfunction where it is bounded, and its differential is non-vanishing on the interior of\nmf (where it is thus one of the standard coordinates, namely the variable along the\ninterval referred to above; others being t\u22121 and y, coordinates on Y = \u2202X; we use\nt\u22121 as a boundary defining function for mf). However, Vb (M\u0303 ) is still spanned by\nthe lift of the same vector fields, except that the smooth structure is replaced by\nC \u221e (M\u0303 ). Correspondingly, the symbol spaces are unaffected by the blow-up. Now,\nthe support of d\u03c6 only intersects the front face of M\u0303 among all boundary faces,\nand r/t is bounded from both above and below by positive constants there. Thus,\non the support of d\u03c6, t\u22121 Vb (M\u0303 ) is locally generated by \u2202r , \u2202t and r\u22121 \u2202Y , i.e. by\nvector fields corresponding to the energy space. Thus, on supp d\u03c6, \u2207v \u2208 t\u03ba L2 (M )\nimplies v \u2208 t\u03ba+1 L2 (M ), k < (n \u2212 1)/2, by a Hardy inequality, and so we obtain\nmore generally:\n4The notation is short for \"main face,\" as for X Euclidean (diffeomorphically, not metrically),\nthis can be identified with an open dense subset of the boundary of the radial compactification of\nMinkowski space. Note that the light cone, r/t = 1, hits the boundary in the interior of mf. If\nr/t = 1 in mf were blown up inside M\u0303 , the resulting front face is where Friedlander's radiation\nfield [4] can be defined by rescaling a solution to the wave equation. Indeed, in the interior of this\nfront face (in t > 0) r \u2212 t = (r/t \u2212 1)/t\u22121 becomes a smooth variable along the fibers of the front\nface.\n\n\f22\n\nANDRAS VASY AND JARED WUNSCH\n\ntf\nt\u22121\nr\u22121\nt\u22121\n\nM\n\nmf\n\nr/t\ny\n\nspf\n\nM\u0303\n\nFigure 1. The compactified spacetime M and the blown-up\nspacetime M\u0303 .\nLemma 4.1. Let \u03a5 be an open set in M\u0303 with \u03a5 \u2229 \u2202 M\u0303 \u2282 mf \u25e6 . If supp v \u2282 \u03a5,\n\u2207v \u2208 t\u03ba L2 (M ) =\u21d2 v \u2208 t\u03ba+1 Hb1 (M\u0303 ).\n\nHere the Sobolev space is still relative to the metric density (so L2 (M ) and\nL (M\u0303 ) are the same, as only the smooth structure at infinity changed).\nBefore proceeding, we caution the reader that near temporal infinity, tf, i.e. the\nlift of t = +\u221e on M to M\u0303 , weighted versions of Vb (M\u0303 ) do not give rise to the\nfinite length vector fields relative to dt2 + g (i.e. the energy space). Indeed, in the\ninterior of tf, one is in a compact set of the spatial slice X, and Vb (M\u0303 ) is spanned\nby t\u2202t and smooth vector fields on X, while the energy space corresponds to \u2202t and\nsmooth vector fields on X. In order to emphasize the structure when we stay away\nfrom tf and also from spatial infinity spf, i.e. the lift of \u2202X \u00d7 R, we write\n2\n\nM\u0303 \u2032 = M\u0303 \u25e6 \u222a mf \u25e6 = M\u0303 \\ (tf \u222a spf).\n\nOur convention below is that inner products and norms are on M unless otherwise specified by a subscript X (in which case they are on X). The inner product on\nM on functions is given by integration against the density of dt2 \u2212 g, or equivalently\nthat of dt2 + g. The inner product on vectors on M uses the positive definite inner\nproduct, based on dt2 + g, unless otherwise specified. The one case where we take\nadvantage of the \"otherwise specified\" disclaimer is when we consider the indefinite\nDirichlet form in (4.4), where we use the indefinite form induced by dt2 \u2212 g (so the\ndensity is positive definite, but not the pointwise pairing between vectors) in order\nto use the PDE.\nNow,\n(4.1)\n[\u2202t2 , t\u2212k\u2212s ] = \u22122(k + s)t\u2212k\u2212s\u22121 \u2202t + (k + s)(k + s + 1)t\u2212k\u2212s\u22122 \u2208 t\u2212k\u2212s\u22122 Diff 1b (Rt ).\nMoreover, on M\u0303 \u2032 (hence on supp d\u03c6),\n\nBk,s \u2208 t\u2212k\u22121 Diff 1b (M\u0303 \u2032 ), \u0003 \u2208 t\u22122 Diff 2b (M\u0303 \u2032 ) =\u21d2 [\u0003, Bk,s ] \u2208 t\u2212k\u22123 Diff 2b (M\u0303 \u2032 ).\n\n\fMORAWETZ ESTIMATES FOR THE WAVE EQUATION AT LOW FREQUENCY\n\n23\n\nIn particular, from (3.9),\n(4.2)\n[\u2202t2 + \u2206g + V, Bk,s ]\n= t\u2212k\u2212s \u03c6(r/t)2 \u03c6\u0303(t)2\n\n\u0010X\n\nQ\u2217i rs t\u22121 Ri\n\ni\n\n+ (2s\u2202r\u2217 rs\u22121 \u03c7(r)\u2202r + 2rs\u22123 \u03c7(r)\u2206Y +\n\nn\u22121\n(1 \u2212 s)(n + s \u2212 3)rs\u22123\n2\n\u0011\n\n+ \u2207\u2217X (1 \u2212 \u03c7(r))\u2207X + rs\u22124 Es + rs\u22123\u2212\u03bd \u1ebcs ) + Fk,s ,\n\nwhere Qi \u2208 t\u22121 Diff 1b (Rt ), Ri \u2208 r\u22121 Diff 1b (X) contains no y-derivatives and is supported on supp \u03c7, Es \u2208 Diff 2sc (X), \u1ebcs \u2208 Diff 2b (X), Fk,s \u2208 t\u2212k\u22123 Diff 2b (M\u0303 ) and Fk,s is\nsupported on supp d\u03c6. Note that the term with \u2207X has spatially compact support,\nand could be absorbed into Es , but writing the commutator in the stated manner is\nconvenient for it gives a positive definite result modulo Es , which we later control\nseparately, by low energy techniques. Moreover, for 0 < s < 1 (which is the case if\n0 < \u03c3 < 1/2), we may assume that the \u1ebcs term can be absorbed into the first three\nterms on the right hand side by (3.11). Thus, for 0 < s < 1 the spatial term, arising\nfrom (3.9), is positive modulo the Es term, while the terms Q\u2217i rs t\u22121 Ri arising from\nthe commutator with \u2202t2 , are indefinite.

Roughly speaking, such a weight does not cause problems since we could\ndeal with arbitrary weights t\u2212k already (i.e. k did not need to have a sign). More\nprecisely, the contribution of this weight to the commutator of (1 + \u03b1t)\u22121 Bk,s and\n\u0003 is similar to (4.1), namely [\u2202t2 , t\u2212k\u2212s (1 + \u03b1t)\u22121 ] \u2208 t\u2212k\u2212s\u22123 Diff 1b (Rt ) for \u03b1 > 0,\nand it is uniformly bounded in the larger space t\u2212k\u2212s\u22122 Diff 1b (Rt ) for \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1).\nThus, its role is analogous to that of the Q\u2217i Ri terms of (4.2), which in turn arose\nfrom (4.1); these are estimated in (4.10), and can be controlled by making c small.\nLetting \u03b1 \u2192 0, and using standard functional analytic arguments, completes the\nproof of the theorem.\n\u0003\nWe finally remark that a version of this argument also works for solutions of\nthe wave equation at intermediate frequencies, via Mourre estimate techniques (see\nespecially [5]). While this is not interesting for the homogeneous wave equation,\nwhose middle-frequency solutions will have rapid decay inside the light cone, for the\ninhomogeneous equation it may be of some interest. The key point then is that one\nworks with \u03c8(\u2206+ V ), and \u03c8\u0303(\u2206+ V ), supported near a fixed energy \u03bb0 > 0, and one\ncontrols the analogue of the Es term (that arose above) by shrinking the support\nof \u03c8\u0303, using that \u03c8\u0303(\u2206 + V )Es converges to 0 in norm as the support is shrunk to\n{\u03bb0 } by the relative compactness of Es (which follows from elliptic estimates and\nits decay at spatial infinity). This holds since \u03c8\u0303(\u2206 + V ) converges to 0 strongly as\nthe support is shrunk to {\u03bb0 }, since \u03bb0 is not an L2 eigenvalue of \u2206 + V .\nReferences\n[1] J.-F. Bony and D.
