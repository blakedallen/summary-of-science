The calculated threshold is approximately log\u03a3crit \u223c 2.5, where \u03a3 M\u2299 *\npc\u22122 is the observed surface mass density of an assumed flat gas disk. Above this limit, the rate of molecular\ncloud collisions dominates over spontaneous molecular cloud collapse. This model may explain the apparent\n<\ndiscontinuity in the Schmidt law found recently at 2 <\n\u223c log \u03a3 \u223c 3.\nKey words: galaxies:ISM - ISM:molecules - stars:formation\n\n1.\n\nSpontaneous and collisional star formation\n\nThe onset of star formation within an ensemble of\nmolecular clouds is thought to have two modes, spontaneous (stochastic) gravitational collapse (Bonnell et\nal. 2004; Krumholz & McKee 2005), and collisions between molecular clouds (e.g., Tan 2000). Most studies to\ndate have focused on one of these two possibilities. In\nactual physical situations which cover a range of physical\nparameters, these two processes should both have effect\non the overall star formation in galaxy disks. In regions\nof higher molecular density, collisions should become dominant over spontaneous formation, because collisions will\noccur on timescales shorter than spontaneous star formation. In regions with scarse cloud number density, collisions should also be rare and therefore star formation\nfrom other stochastic means should dominate. The transition from spontaneous to collisional star formation may\nhave observed effects on the relation between molecular\ngas content and star formation rate (SFR). This expected\ntransition has not been clearly observed yet, however.\nThere is growing observational evidence that cloud collision can trigger star formation (Loren 1976; Scoville\net al. 1986; Hasegawa et al. 1994; Koda & Sofue 2006).\nThese studies show that cloud collisions are seen mainly\nat high density regions, and therefore merging and interacting galaxies are candidates for galaxies forming stars\nmainly by collision. A comparison of these galaxies\nwith normal galaxies have been conducted by Young et\nal. (1986). They have found that merging/interacting\ngalaxies exhibit SFRs that are an order of magnitude\nhigher than normal galaxies of the same molecular gas\ndensity. Similarly, central regions and spiral arms of normal galaxies, which generally have high molecular densities, may include star formation induced by collision.\nHowever, quantitative calculations which give direct (observable) parameters on exactly where in parameter space\n\nstar formation transits from spontaneous to collisional\nmechanisms have not been proposed.\n2.\n\nModel\n\nWe consider a spiral galaxy that can be modelled as a\nthin disk. We take a cylinder of height 2d and base area\nS within the same plane as the galaxy disk (see schematic\nfigure 1). We can think of d as the scale height, and S\nas the area of the deprojected beam of the observation.\nWithin this cyclinder are n spherical molecular clouds\nwith diameter D, mass M and mean molecular density\n\u03c1. Assuming that the observer can see through the disk\nand derive a surface molecular gas density \u03a3, the obvious\nequations are:\n\u03a3=\n\nnM\nS\n\n4\u03c0\nM=\n3\n\n(1)\n\u0012\n\nD\n2\n\n\u00133\n\n\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nThese molecular clouds are moving about the cylinder\nwith an inter-cloud velocity dispersion \u03c3.\nFor further analysis, we have several simple assumptions:\n\u2022 star formation occurs on the free fall timescale, dependent only on the initial density\n\u2022 molecular clouds are moving about the thin cylinder\nin random motion\n\u2022 star formation in galactic disks is a two dimensional\nprocess.\nThe third assumption is motivated from the fact that\ngiant molecular clouds have size comparable to the scale\nheight d (Stark & Lee 2005; Malhotra 1994). We can\ntherefore assume that all processes occur in two dimensions and we can hereafter ignore d hereafter.\n\n\f2\n\nAstronomical Society of Japan\n\n[Vol. ,\nTable 1.

In\na regime where spontaneous star formation is dominant\nover collision, parameters should satisfy the relation\n\u03c3tff \u226a \u03bbmfp\nso that the GMC does not collide with other GMCs during\nformation. On the other hand, a regime where collision is\ndominant should satisfy\n\u03c3tff \u226b \u03bbmfp .\nTherefore, if a threshold exists between these two regimes,\nparameters should satisfy the equation\n\u03c3tff \u2248 \u03bbmfp .\n\n(5)\n\nSubstituting equations (1) through (4) into (5) and denoting the critical \u03a3 as \u03a3crit , we obtain\nlog\n\n\u03a3crit\n=\n[M\u2299 ]\n\n\u22121.35+2log\n3.\n\nlog \u03a3crit [M\u2299 pc\u22122 ]\n2.87\n2.17\n1.87\n2.89\n2.19\n1.89\n\nNotes- D, the diameter of molecular clouds, are taken\nso that it may represent smallest (10pc) and largest\n(300pc) clouds. \u03c3 from literature ranges from 4 km/s\n(Liszt & Burton 1981; Clemens 1985) to 7km/s (Stark &\nBrand 1989), but we take values from 1 to 10 km/s to\ndemonstrate the range of values \u03a3crit may take.\n\nMolecular Cloud\n\nWe have\n\u0013 12\n\u0012\n3\u03c0\ntff =\n32G\u03c1\n\n\u03c3 [kms\u22121 ]\n1\n5\n10\n1\n5\n10\n\nD\n\u03c1\n\u03c3\n+1.5log\n\u2212log\n(6)\n[pc]\n[M\u2299 * pc\u22123 ]\n[km * s\u22121 ]\n\n\u03a3crit value\n\nNow we apply actual values to equation (6). For typical Galactic molecular clouds with D \u223c 60[pc] and \u03c1 \u223c\n\n30[cm\u22123 ] = 1.5[M\u2299 *pc\u22123 ], and inter-cloud velocity dispersion \u03c3 \u223c 4[km * s\u22121 ], we obtain log\u03a3crit = 1.91 [M\u2299 pc\u22122 ].\nFor observed molecular surface densities above this value,\ncollisions dominate.\nWe can further reduce the number of variables. Dame\net al. (1986) have found that for Galactic molecular\nclouds, \u03c1 scales with D such that log \u03c1 = 2.80 \u2212 1.32 logD.\nSubstituting this relation into equation (6) gives\nlog\n\nD\n\u03c3\n\u03a3crit\n= 2.85 + 0.02 log\n\u2212 log\n[M\u2299 ]\n[pc]\n[km * s\u22121 ]\n\n(7)\n\nIt is apparent from equation (7), that the critical density\nis practically independent of GMC diameter. The critical\nsurface density is dependent mainly on cloud velocity dispersion \u03c3, which is generally taken to be below 10 km*s\u22121 .\nTable 1 lists values of \u03a3crit for a range of parameters to\nevaluate the lowest and highest cases.\nErrors for this value can be evaluated based on the uncertainty of the parameters. \u03c3 derived from other studies, numerical and observational, have agreed-upon values between 1 [km/s] and 10[km/s]. The value of D,\nwhich must be taken so that D is representative of the\nsize which dominates star formation, is between 10 [pc]\nand several\u00d7100[pc], although uncertainties in D have little effect on \u03a3crit . On the average, we may safely apply\nerrors so that \u03a3crit = 2.8+0.1\n\u22121.0\n4.\n\nComparison with observation\n\nThe empirical relation between gas density and SFR,\noften referred to as the Schmidt law, has long been studied, and the relation of the form \u03a3SFR \u221d \u03a3N , where \u03a3SFR\nis the area averaged SFR, has been extensively studied.\nDetails can be found elsewhere (e.g., Buat et al. 1989,\nBuat 1992, Kennicutt 1998, Rownd and Young 1999,Wong\nand Blitz 2002, Boissier et al. 2003, Yao et al. 2003, Gao\nand Solomon 2004, Heyer et al. 2004). This law, however,\nowes its dynamic range to the contrast between starburst\ngalaxies and normal spiral galaxies. The starbursts have\nhigher molecular density whereas normal spirals have considerably lower molecular density, so the combination of\nthese two types of galaxies contributes dominantly to the\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nUsage of pasj00.cls\n\nFIR based SFR within 10%. The order-of-magnitude offset between the two types of galaxies therefore can not be\nattributed to such observational shorthands. The unaccountable offset may be due to differences in the physical\nprocess of star formation. Elmegreen (1989) has suggested\nthat a factor 4 decrease in tff will occur at a shocked surface of a molecular cloud, and this can account for much of\nthe rise in SFR for starbursts, which lies in the \"collision\"\nregime in figure 2.\n\n-2\nlog \u03a3SFRcorr (Msun/sqpc/yr)\n\n3\n\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n\n5.\n\n-7\n\n5.1.\n\n-8\n-9\n-10\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nlog \u03a3 (Msun/sqpc)\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFig. 2.

Filled circles represent normal\ngalaxies, and open squares represent circumnuclear starbursts. The center vertical line is the value for \u03a3crit = 2.8,\nwhere the dashed lines represent errors as stated in text.\n\nlinear fit of the Schmidt type power law.\nAny systematic differences in the Schmidt law between\nthese two types of galaxies are ignored by fitting both with\nthe same function. Indeed, a possible significant difference\nin these two types of galaxies were found by Komugi et\nal. (2005), by the study of high molecular density central\nregions of normal spirals. The Schmidt law, with normal galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts superposed, is\nshown in figure 2.\nAn apparent discontinuity exists in the two sequences,\nand the critical surface density \u03a3crit = 2.8+0.1\n\u22121.0 , shown as a\nvertical line, coincides with the transition. Assuming that\nthis apparent transition is real, it may be explained by\nchange in the physical nature of star formation, namely\nthe transition from spontaneous to cloud-cloud collisional\nstar formation, induced by the increase in molecular density.\nIt must be pointed out that the SFR for the circumnuclear starbursts are derived from far-infrared (FIR) luminosities, and those of normal galaxies from internal extinction corrected H\u03b1 luminosities (see Komugi et al. (2005)\nfor details).\nThese two methods of deriving the SFR are known to\ndiffer, in the sense that FIR gives systematically higher\nSFRs compared to H\u03b1. FIR derived SFRs overestimate\nthe true current SFR because it is contaminated with\nemission from dust heated by lower mass stars. H\u03b1 emission is subject to interstellar dust extinction, therefore underestimating the current SFR. These may lead the reader\nto believe that the discontinuity is not a true one due to\nphysical processes. In figure 2, however, the SFR for normal galaxies is derived from internal extinction corrected\nH\u03b1 luminosity, found by Kewley et al. (2002) to agree with\n\nDiscussion\nOther parameters\n\nThe simplicity of equation (5) poses a question\nof whether this analysis is not an oversimplification.\nTherefore, we go on to consider other parameters which\nmay modify equation (5). The basic assumptions made\nin section 1 is that we have assumed that star formation\noccurs on the free fall timescale tff , but the timescale of\nstar formation is still an unresolved issue, and studies often give longer timescales than tff . Second, we have assumed a random motion of the molecular clouds based on\nepicyclic motion of the clouds, while in reality, differential\nrotation in galactic disks is also important to the overall\nmotion of clouds.\nThe star formation timescale tsf , is equal to tff \u223c 106 [yr]\nwhen star formation is dominated by gravitational pertubations, and this type of formulation tsf \u223c tff has been\nadopted in many studies. Other studies argue that tsf\nis longer than tff because magnetic fields provide support against gravitational contraction, and star formation is impossible without ambipolar diffusion (Tan 2000)\nin which case the star formation timescale is longer by\nan order of magnitude (McKee & Holliman 1999). Still,\nsome observational studies suggest that star formation occurs on scales of \u223c 106 [yr], based on the observed offset\nbetween CO and H\u03b1 arm in spirals (Egusa et al. 2004).\nThis issue is not resolved, and we adopt tsf \u223c tff for simplicity. However, if tsf > tff by an order or more, collisional star formation will dominate at a much lower observed density of about \u03a3crit = 1.8 \u2212 log \u03c3. The differential rotation of galactic disks causes molecular clouds\nto collide as in the case of random motion. Gammie et\nal. (1991) find \u03c3 = 5.1 [km * s\u22121 ] for cloud encounters due\ndifferential rotation, whereas random velocity dispersion\nof GMCs are \u223c 7 [km * s\u22121 ](See Stark & Brand 1989),\nor \u223c 4 [km * s\u22121 ] (Liszt & Burton 1981; Clemens 1985).\nTherefore, we can say that the value of cloud collision\nvelocity, \u03c3, is comparable even with the assumption of\ndifferential rotation.\n5.2.\n\nMergers and interacting galaxies\n\nThe argument of threshold surface density proposed in\nthis Letter cannot specify what kind of change will appear in the \u03a3SFR \u2212 \u03a3 relation such as that seen in figure\n2. The discontinuity may well be a result of transition\nfrom spontaneous to collisional star formation, but our\nresults do not predict or necessitate a discontinuity. A\nsudden rise in SFR as collision dominates, however, is\n\n\f4\n\nAstronomical Society of Japan\n\nphysically intriguing and easy to understand. In a collision between two GMCs, the shocked region between the\nclouds are compressed so that the density abruptly becomes higher in this layer compared to other parts of the\nGMC. This will shorten tff , and consequently the SFR is\nhigher (Elmegreen (1989) finds that tff is shortened by a\nfactor of 0.25): this should appear as a discontinuity in\nthe Schmidt law.\nIn this respect, it is reasonable to expect that merging\nand interacting galaxies form stars mainly by cloud-cloud\ncollision, and therefore exhibit higher SFR than galaxies\nwith the same molecular gas density. In these systems,\nthe critical density \u03a3crit is far lower than normal spirals,\nbecause GMCs in colliding galaxies will have far higher\ncollision velocity \u03c3. In a collision between two spirals,\nthe typical rotation velocity of the galaxies will become\nrepresentative of \u03c3, with about \u223c 200[km * s\u22121], depending\non the sense of rotation of the colliding spirals. In this\ncase, log \u03a3crit can be 0 to 1, the typical global surface\nmolecular mass density of spirals, so that most of the star\nformation can be attributed to cloud-cloud collision.\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have constructed a simple model to consider the\nthreshold between star formation dominated by spontaneous gravitational collapse and cloud-cloud collision.\nAlthough both cloud-cloud collision and gravitational collapse processes have for decades been thought to cause\nstar formation, the threshold of these two processes has\nnot attracted much attention. Most studies of collisional star formation have focused on qualitative aspects.\nNumerical studies such as that by Mazzei (1987) have\npointed out a threshold, but with the contradictory result\nthat collisions between clouds result in lower star formation rates.\nOur model, by assuming that star formation is a bimodal process dominated either by spontaneous gravitational collapse or cloud-cloud collision, does not take\ninto account the possiblity of star formation induced by\nexpanding SNR shells (self-propagating star formation),\nor complicated structures in temperatures or chemistry.\nSimple as our model is, it succeeds in explaining the apparent discontinuity in the Schmidt law. Moreoever, our\nformulation coupled with the empirical implication that\nmost clouds are virialized and thus GMC size and mean\ndensity are anticorrelated, leads to the conclusion that the\nthreshold surface mass density log\u03a3crit is practically independent of cloud parameters (size, density, mass), but that\nit depends on the mean velocity dispersion \u03c3 of clouds.\nFurther tests of our formulation can be expected from\nobservations of mergers. In merging spiral pairs whose\nrotation are oriented in the reverse direction, the relative\nvelocity of the clouds are increased so that according to\nequation (7), collisional star formation starts at a very\nlow surface mass density. However, if the rotation is\noriented in the same direction, \u03c3 will not increase as much\nas in the reverse orientation. Thus, the threshold log \u03a3crit\nstarts at a higher density. Assuming that collisional star\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nformation results in a discontinuity in the SFR relation\nwith surface gas density, we can compare mergers with\nthese two orientations with average normal galaxies\nwhich we can assume to be dominated by a spontaneous\nprocess. Then, we should see that mergers with reverse\nrotation orientation will start its discontinuity in the\nSchmidt law at a lower surface mass density than mergers\nwith ordered rotation.\n\nThe authors thank H.
