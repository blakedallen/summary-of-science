INTRODUCTION\n\nIt is now well established that the properties of supermassive black holes (SMBH) found at the centers of galaxies\ntoday are tightly coupled to those of their hosts implying a\nstrong link between black hole and galaxy formation. The\nstrongest direct constraint on the high-redshift evolution of\nSMBHs comes from the observations of the luminous quasars\nat z \u223c 6 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (Fan et al.\n2006; Jiang et al. 2009) and even more recently at z = 7\n(Mortlock et al. 2011). Although rare (the comoving space\ndensity of z \u223c 6 quasars is roughly n \u223c a few Gpc\u22123 ) the inferred hole masses of these quasars are in excess of 109 M\u2299\ncomparable to the masses of the most massive black holes in\nthe Universe today. The origin of these massive black hole\nseed and the physical conditions that allow early growth to\nsupermassive black holes remain a challenging problem.\nIn order to have had sufficient time to build up via gas accretion and BH mergers (resulting from the hierarchical merging\nof their host halos) the first 'seed' black holes must have appeared at early epoch, z > 10. The origin and nature of this\nseed population remain uncertain. Two distinct populations\nof seed masses, in the range of 100 \u2212 105 M\u2299 have been proposed: the small mass seeds are usually thought to be the remnants of the first generation of PopIII stars formed of metalfree gas at z \u223c 20 \u2212 30 (Bromm et al. 1999; Abel et al. 2000;\nNakamura & Umemura 2001; Yoshida et al. 2003; Gao et al.\n2006, e.g.), while the large seeds form in direct dynamical collapse in metal-free galaxies (Koushiappas et al. 2004;\nBegelman et al. 2006, although see also Mayer et al. 2010\n1 McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000\nForbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213\n2 Computer Science Department, Carnegie, Mellon University, 5000\nForbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213\n3 Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies Schloss-Wolfsbrunnenweg\n35, 68118 Heidelberg, Germany\n4 Zentrum f\u00fcr Astronomie der Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Astronomisches\nRecheninstitut, M\u00f6nchhofstr. 12-14, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany\n\nfor direct collapse into a massive blackhole in metal enriched\nregime).\nGrowing the seeds to 109 M\u2299 in less than a billion years\nrequires extremely large accretion rates - as mergers between\nblack holes are too rare and too inefficient for significant\ngrowth. For a black hole accreting at the critical Eddington accretion rate its luminosity LEdd = (4\u03c0Gcm p )/\u03c3T MBH =\n\u03b7 \u1e40 Edd c2 (where G, c, m p and \u03c3T are the gravitational constant, speed of light, proton mass and Thomson cross section, and \u03b7 is the standard accretion efficiency) implies an exponential growth at the characteristic Eddington timescales,\ntEdd = 450\u03b7/(1 \u2212 \u03b7) Myr, such that MBH = Mseed et/tEdd . For a\nseed mass ranging from Mseed \u223c 100 \u2212 105 M\u2299 this requires\n10 \u2212 17 e-foldings to reach MBH \u223c 109 M\u2299 . The crucial question (for any given seed model) is then where (if at all, in\nwhich kind of halos) and how (at what gas inflow rates) such\nvigorous accretion can be sustained at these early times.\nAs bright quasars are likely to occur in extremely rare highdensity peaks in the early universe, large computational volumes are needed to study them. Here we use a new large\ncosmological Smooth Particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation, Massive Black (covering a volume of [0.75 Gpc]3 ) with\nsufficiently high resolution (over 65 billion particles) to be\nable to include tested prescriptions for star formation, black\nhole accretion and associated feedback processes to investigate whether and if such objects may be formed within our\nstandard structure formation models. Crucially, our MassiveBlack simulation is of sufficiently high-resolution to allow us\nto follow the mass distribution in the inner regions of galaxies and hence model star formation and black hole growth directly and self-consistently while still evolving a close to Gigaparsec scale region. It therefore provides a unique framework to study the formation of the first quasars.\n2. METHODOLOGY\n2.1. Simulation run: \"Massive Black\"\n\n\f2\n\nDi Matteo et al.\n\nF IG . 1.- The cosmological mass distribution in our the simulation volume at z = 5. The projected gas density over the whole volume ('unwrapped' into 2D)\nis shown in the large scale image. The two overlaid panels show successive zoom-ins by factor of 10, center on the region where the most massive black hole is\nfound.\n\nOur new simulation has been performed with the cosmological TreePM-Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)\ncode P-GADGET, a hybrid version of the parallel code GADGET2 (Springel 2005) which has been extensively modified\nand upgraded to run on the new generation of Petaflop scale\nsupercomputers (e.g. machines like the upcoming BlueWaters\nat NCSA). The major improvement over previous versions of\nGADGET is in the use of threads in both the gravity and SPH\npart of the code which allows the effective use of multi core\n(currently 8-12 cores per node) processors combined with an\noptimum number of MPI task per node. Here we present initial results from the largest cosmological smooth particle hydrodynamic simulation to date which was run on 105 cores\ncorresponding to the entire Cray-XT5 \"Kraken\" at NICS. The\nMassiveBlack simulation contains Npart = 2 \u00d7 32003 = 65.5\nbillion particles in a volume of 533 Mpc/h on a side with\na gravitational smoothing length \u01eb = 5.5 kpc/h in comoving\nunits). The gas and dark matter particle masses are mg =\n5.7 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 and mDM = 2.8 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 respectively. This\nrun contains gravity and hydrodynamics but also extra physics\n(subgrid modeling) for star formation (Springel & Hernquist\n2003), black holes and associated feedback processes. The\nsimulation has currently been run from z = 159 to z = 4.75\n(beyond our original target redshift of z = 6). For this massive calculation it is currently prohibitive to push it to z = 0 as\nthis would require an unreasonable amount of computational\ntime on the world's current fastest supercomputers. The simulated redshift range probes early structure formation and the\nemergence of the first galaxies and quasars.\n2.2. Black hole Accretion and Feedback Model\n\nThe prescription for accretion and associated feedback from massive black holes has been developed by\nDi Matteo et al. (2005); Springel et al. (2005). Detailed\nstudies of this implementation in cosmological simulations and associated predictions (Sijacki et al. 2007; Li et al.\n\n2007; Di Matteo et al. 2008; Croft et al. 2009; Sijacki et al.\n2009; Colberg & di Matteo 2008; Degraf et al. 2010, 2011b;\nBooth & Schaye 2011) have shown that it can reproduce\nall the basic properties of black hole growth, the observed\nMBH \u2212 \u03c3, relation (Di Matteo et al. 2008), the quasar luminosity function (Degraf et al. 2010) and its evolution as well\nas the spatial clustering of quasars (DeGraf et al. 2011c).\nIn a nutshell our black hole accretion and feedback model\n(Di Matteo et al. 2008) consists of representing black holes by\ncollisionless particles that grow in mass (from an initial seed\nblack hole) by accreting gas in their environments. A fraction of the radiative energy released by the accreted material\nis assumed to couple thermally to nearby gas and influence\nits motion and thermodynamic state (typically referred to as\nBH feedback). Our underlying assumption is that the largescale feeding of galactic nuclei with gas (which is resolved\nin our simulations) is ultimately the critical process that determines the growth of massive black holes and the peak of\nthe quasar phase (Di Matteo et al. 2008; Degraf et al. 2010,\n2011b). The model, therefore needs to be viewed in the context of cosmological growth of black holes and not detailed\naccretion physics. While a more detailed treatment of this\nis certainly desirable and begins to be possible for individual\ngalaxies (Kim et al. 2011; Hopkins & Quataert 2010, e.g.) it\nis still infeasible for cosmological simulations that seek to follow whole populations of galaxies and their BHs.\nWe introduce collisionless 'sink' particles in the simulations to model black holes at the centers of forming minihalos.\nIn order to achieve this we keep track of the formation of minihalos by running a friends-of-friends (FOF) group finder on\nthe fly. The group finder is run on sufficiently closely spaced\nintervals to identify the newly collapsing halos in which we\nplace a black hole seed of fixed mass, M = 105 h\u22121 M\u2299 (if they\ndo not already contain a BH). In practice most of the halos of\nthis mass and their black holes are formed between z = 15\nand z = 30. The black hole particle then grows in mass via\n\n\fCold flows and the first quasars\n\n3\n\nF IG . 2.- Snapshots of the evolution of the cold-flow-fed massive black holes. The images visualise the projected gas distribution color coded by temperature\naround three example quasars (one in each row) across five different redshifts (labelled on each of the five panels; left to right). The projected density ranges from\n\u223c 10\u22122 to \u223c 102 h M\u2299 pc\u22122 and the temperature from \u223c 104 (blue colors) to 108 K (red colors). The quasar positions are indicated by the green circles and the\nvirial radius of each halo by the blue circles. The images show the typical structure of cold streams that penetrate the halo all the way into the central regions of\n> 7.5) the gas is cold and the black hole is still of relatively low mass, but then below this redshift the black hole growth exponentiates as\ngalaxies. At first (z \u223c\n< 6.\nincreasing amounts of cold gas is fed into the central regions. Black hole feedback heats the gas, but does not distrupt the cold streams until z \u223c\n\n4\u03c0G2 M2 \u03c1\n\naccretion of surrounding gas according to \u1e40BH = (c2 +v2 )BH3/2\ns\n(where \u03c1 and cs are the density and sound speed of the hot\nand cold phase of the ISM gas which when taken into account\nappropriately as in Pelupessy et al. (2007) - this eliminates the\nneed for a correction factor \u03b1 previously introduced - and vBH\nis the velocity of the black hole relative to the gas) and by\nmerging with other black holes. We limit the accretion rate to\nEddington (or a few times Eddington). A similar Bondi model\nhas also been used by Johnson & Bromm (2007) to study the\ngrowth of the first massive PopII black holes remnants.\nThe radiated luminosity, Lr , from the black hole is related to\nthe accretion rate, \u1e40BH as Lr = \u01ebr (\u1e40BH \u00d7 c2 ) , where we take\nthe standard mean value \u01ebr = 0.1. Some coupling between\nthe liberated luminosity and the surrounding gas is expected:\nin the simulation 5% of the luminosity is (isotropically) deposited as thermal energy in the local black hole kernel, providing some form of feedback energy (Di Matteo et al. 2005).\nThis model of AGN feedback as isotropic thermal coupling\nto the surrounding gas, albeit simple, is a reasonable approximation to any physical mechanism which leads to a shock\nfront which isotropizes and becomes well mixed over physical scales smaller than those relevant in our simulations and\non timescales smaller than the dynamical timescales of the\nhalos (Di Matteo et al. 2008; Hopkins et al. 2006). Two black\nhole particles merge if they come within the spatial resolution (i.e. within the local SPH smoothing length) with relative\n\nspeed below the local sound speed.\nWe\nnote\nthat\nat\nleast\ntwo\nindependent\ngroups(Booth & Schaye 2009; Johansson et al. 2008)\nnow have also adopted the same modeling for black hole\naccretion, feedback and BH mergers in the context of hydrodynamic simulations. These independent works, and in\nparticular, the cosmological simulations by (Booth & Schaye\n2009) (part of the OWL program) have allowed to independently explore the parameter space of the reference model of\n(Di Matteo et al. 2008), as well as variations of our model\nprescriptions. This large body of already existing work and\ninvestigations make this particular model a good choice for\nmore detailed studies of the growth of the first quasars which\nis the subject we focus on here. In associated publications we\nshow that the MassiveBlack quasars are fully consistent with\nall the fundamental statistical constraints for the observed\npopulations of high redshift quasars, and in particular with\nthe observed luminosity functions of quasars and the high\nredshift clustering (DeGraf et al. 2011a) and basic properties\nof quasar hosts (Khandai et al. 2011). To produce the black\nhole history from the simulation data we rely on SQL\ndatabases developed by Lopez et al. (2011).\n3.

The resolution however is\nsufficiently fine to make it possible to zoom into increasingly\nsmaller regions and search for massive black holes that have\nexperienced significant growth. Superimposed onto the full\nscale image we show a zoomed region (scale of 100 Mpc h\u22121\nand 10 Mpc h\u22121 on a side from left to right, respectively)\naround one of the largest black holes/quasars at this time.\nOn these scales the images show the typical filaments that\ncompose the cosmic web and in particular how the first massive quasars (the most massive black hole, at the center has\na mass MBH \u223c 3 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 ) form at the same type of intersection/nodes of filaments that are the expected locations of\nrare (massive) dark matter halos. Remarkably we do find ten\nblack holes in the volume that have grown to about a billion\nsolar masses by z \u223c 6 or earlier (and many other of smaller\nmasses).\nFigure 2 shows the environment and its evolution (five timelapses from about z \u223c 9 to z \u223c 5) of three examples from\nwithin this sample. Their detailed mass assembly history is\nshown in Fig. 3. The panels in Figure 2 show the evolution of the gas density color coded by temperature. These\nobjects are found to be continuously fed by intense streams\nof high density gas (consistent with the cold-accretion picture for the growth of galaxies at intermediate/high redshift\nby (Dekel & Birnboim 2006, e.g.). During these times Eddington accretion is attained and sustained. By showing the\ntemperature of the gas, the images clearly make visible an expanding 'bubble' (emerging from about z \u223c 6.5 \u2212 7) of hot\ngas (red colors) around the central quasars (whose positions\nare indicated by green circles). This bubble created by the BH\nfeedback is more or less confined within the halo (the virial\nradius of the halo is shown by the blue circles in Fig. 2) for\n< 6. Below this redshift, and rather abruptly, the energy rez\u223c\nleased by the quasars heats and expels the gas as a wind well\nbeyond the halo. Black hole growth has now become selfregulated (see also Figure 3, Eddington rates are reached only\nsporadically). Although the effects of quasar feedback in our\nmodel have been studied in detail previously (Di Matteo et al.\n\n2005, 2008) what is remarkable here is that even though feedback energy consistently heats the gas within and eventually\nbeyond the scale of halos, it does not do much to the streams\nof in-flowing cold gas. There the gas density is so high (e.g.\nFig. 3) that the gas cannot be stopped because, it is too difficult to couple enough feedback energy to it to disrupt the\nflow. The streams get somewhat (albeit not completely) dis< 6. Before this happens billion solar mass\nrupted only at z \u223c\nblack holes are already assembled (see Fig. 3), a process that\ntakes a few hundred million years.\nSustained phases of Eddington accretion onto these black\nholes start as early as z \u223c 9 \u2212 10 and go on uninterrupted\nuntil z \u223c 6 \u2212 7, leading to BH masses of the order of\n109 M\u2299 in the first massive halos of roughly Mhalo \u223c 1012 M\u2299\nat z \u223c 6 \u2212 7 (rare 3 \u2212 4\u03c3 peaks of the density distribution). We have indeed a few objects (the range of the 10\nmost massive is shown by the orange areas in Fig. 3) that\nreach these high masses already at z \u223c 7 consistent with\n(Mortlock et al. 2011). Interestingly, this process of BH assembly is apparently facilited by the \"cold flows\" picture of\ngalaxy formation which has revolutionized our understanding of galaxy assembly below the threshold dark matter mass\nof Mhalo \u223c 1012 M\u2299 (Dekel & Birnboim 2006; Dekel et al.\n2009; Kere\u0161 et al. 2005, 2009). With MassiveBlack we are\nable to trace the formation of the first, rare massive halos,\nthose which are mostly assembled by high density (high redshift) cold streams (Dekel et al. 2009). We find that these\nsame streams easily penetrate all the way into central regions of galaxies even in the presence of strong feedback. We\nfind however that once Mhalo \u223c 1012 M\u2299 and halos enter the\nregime where they are shock-heated (Dekel et al. 2009) the\nBH growth becomes finally self-regulated (see accretion rate\nevolution in Fig. 3). The temperature of the accreting gas also\nis raised well above the virial temperature, Tvir \u223c 107 K, rendering some of the gas unbound; Fig. 3). This the point the\nblack hole masses level off at a few 109 M\u2299 (Fig. 3). Even\nthough at z < 6 in massive halos the outflows clearly affect the\nincoming gas it is not clear they fully distrupt the cold flows.\nAccording to Dekel & Birnboim (2006, e.g), albeit based on\nsomewhat lower redshift than what we probe, cold streams\n\n\fCold flows and the first quasars\n\n5\n\nhole is fully commensurate with that of cold flows and always\nremains below Tgas \u223c 105.5\u22126 K just as predicted in galaxy formation Dekel & Birnboim (2006); Kere\u0161 et al. (2005). In the\nshock-heated regime the temperature of the gas would rise to\nTvir as it enters the halo. However this is not seen.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\nF IG . 4.- The temperature of the gas that is eventually accreted onto the\nblack hole is shown as a function of its position within the host halo (r is\nplotted in physical units). The plot shows a typical example for one of the\nhost halos in Fig. 3. The points with different symbols representing the\ngroups of 32 nearest neighbours at different redshifts (in the colors indicated\nby the legend) all traced back to z = 8.5. The gray hatched region show the\ngravitational softening lengths\n.\n\nshould still not be fully distrupted in this rare massive objects\neven if a dilute hot medium forms. In future work we will\naddress this issue in our simulations in some more details.\nWe note that the black holes occupying these rare massive\nhalos hardly undergo any mergers, indicative that their hosts\nare not undergoing major galaxies mergers. In the inset in Fig.\n3 we show the histories of all black holes that merge into the\nmain progenitor, which is typical of what we see: a few and\ntypically minor mergers occur. At the redshifts relevant for\nthe first quasars, however, galaxy formation is very different:\nmergers are still extremely rare events and halos have not yet\nassembled above their shock heating scale (Dekel et al. 2009),\nso that quasars are fueled directly by cold streams/flows.\nTo illustrate directly the origin of the gas fueling the first\nquasars we track in the simulation the prior history of particles that end up in the vicinity of the black hole, and hence\ncontribute to the accretion. Figure 4 shows one example of\nthe temperature as a function of radius of particles that have\nparticipated into the accretion onto the BH between z = 6 and\nz = 8.5 (within the smoothing length of the black hole particle). The plot shows that particles always remain cold as they\nenter the virial radius well into the ten of kpc region in-fact all\nthe way into the region of from which accretion onto the black\nhole occurs. Here some of the gas is heated, as expected, by\nBH feedback. The temperature of the gas feeding the black\n\nWith our new large cosmological simulation MassiveBlack\nwe show that the short timescale associated with infall via\ncold flows and the short cooling timescales in cold radial\nstreams that penetrate the halo render the flow into the central regions unstoppable by feedback allowing it to easily sustain BH growth at the Eddington rates to build up the required\nBH masses by z = 6 \u2212 7. One consequence of this scenario\nis that BH masses at these redshifts are expected to show\ndeviations from the local MBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation. BH masses assembled faster (most growth occurs over few hundred million years) than the stellar spheroid (assembled over Gyrs\ntimescales). Black hole masses larger than that inferred from\nthe local MBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation have infact been suggested for the\nfirst quasars. Stream fed accretion will still be relevant over\nthe peak of the quasar phase but mergers (as merger rates peak\ncloser to those redshift) will become an increasingly major\nplayer in their growth and formation. We speculate however\nthat most of the growth of a quasar's mass is likely to always\noccur before the shock heating scale of an halo is reached\nmuch like most of its star formation rate (Dekel et al. 2009).\nWe will investigate this further in our large volume in future\nwork. Our scenario is somewhat similar to that proposed by\nMayer et al. (2010) or Li et al. (2007) yet, crucially it does\nnot rely on a major merger to induce the strong gas inflows\nbut points to a more common origin for them particularly at\nthese redshifts (which we could find by virtue of having a\nlarge volume in our simulation, see also Sijacki et al. (2009)\nwho followed the build-up of a single hihigh-z quasar). As\nwe have shown, relaxing the constraint for massive mergers\nmakes it plausible to attain quite commonly large black hole\nmasses as high as z = 7 commensurate with Mortlock et al.\n(2011).\n\nStimulating discussions at the Aspen Center for Physics\nand in particular with Eliot Quataert, Romain Teyssier, Lucio\nMayer and Elena Rossi are greatly aknowledged.
