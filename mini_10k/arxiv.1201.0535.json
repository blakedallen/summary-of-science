It has been proved that the Mickens scheme is dynamically consistent with the original\none regardless of the step-sizes used in numerical simulations, in opposition of the Forward\u2013Euler method\nthat shows numerical instabilities when the step size overcomes a critical value.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe mutualism is acknowledged as a fundamental process in ecological systems: it is an interaction between\nindividuals of different species, from which the interacting populations have beneficial effects. Like predation\nand competition, is now recognized as a consumer\u2013resource (C\u2013R) interaction [7]. The C\u2013R interaction\nrelates the process of nutrient transfer between a consumer and a resource: is a mechanism that describes the\nway by which individuals interact with each other [6]. All the types of mutualism belong to one of the three\ngeneral forms of C\u2013R interaction: uni\u2013directional, bi\u2013directional and indirect C\u2013R mutualisms [5].\nFrom a mathematical point of view only few authors have been attempts to modelize the mutualism,\nprobably because it is difficult to retrieve the experimental data. One of the first attempts is based on Lotka\u2013\nVolterra competition equations [10], but it conducts to the boundless growth of the interacting population.\nSubsequently, other models are proposed where a stable equilibrium for populations are reached [19], [3].\nHolland and DeAngelis [6] developed a general continuous\u2013time model to describe the population dynamic\nfor two mutualistic species; whose model is based on a modified version of the Rosenzweig\u2013MacArthur [18]\nmodel of predation.\nAlthough a continuous\u2013time model based on differential equations constitutes the first step to modelize\na population evolution problem, for the more complexes issues investigated in mathematical biology, the\nnumerical method is the only practicable way. Also, discrete\u2013time models become essential when one wants\nto describe experimental data that have been collected with a certain interval of time. One of the critical\naspects of the discretization methods is just the dependence from this interval, the time step. Since the\ntime step should be selected only in relation to the characteristics of the problem under examination, it is\nnecessary to choose a reliable discretization method that allows to make this transformation without any\nrestriction on time step, as well as not to introduce artifacts, change the linear stability properties etc.. Since,\nin general, these requirements are not satisfied from all the discretization methods (see i.e., [14]), in this paper\nis presented the application of the Nonstandard Finite Difference scheme [11] to the system of differential\nequations discussed by Holland and DeAngelis in the articles [5] and [7]. In this work are only considered the\nequations describing the population dynamic for the bi\u2013directional C\u2013R mutualism since the uni\u2013directional\nproblem is easily solved once the bi\u2013directional one is solved.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTime Continuous Approach\n\nA mathematical model for population growth can be generally described by a system of first order of\nautonomous ordinary differential equations:\n\uf8f1 d\u03be\n\uf8f2 dt = f (\u03be, k)\n(1)\n\uf8f3\n\u03be(t0 ) = \u03be0 ,\nwith f : Rn \u2212\u2192 Rn is supposed to be sufficiently smoothed; \u03be = \u03be(t) : [0, +\u221e) \u2212\u2192 Rn are the coordinates,\nwith initial condition \u03be0 \u2208 Rn ; finally k = (k1 , k2 , ...) represents the system parameters. If f is globally\nLipschitz then there exists a unique solution \u03be for all t \u2265 t0 , hence the eq. (1) defines a dynamical system on\nRn . For a system defined with eq. (1) we define a steady state solution (or also fixed point of f ) a point\n\u03be \u0303 \u2208 Rn that satisfies the relation:\n \u0303 = 0,\nf (\u03be)\n\n(2)\n\n \u0303 (\u03be)\n \u0303 = 0, \u03be \u0303 \u2208 Rn } to refer to the set of steady\nIn the continuation of the text will be used the set \u0393c = {\u03be|f\nstates solutions.\nIf f \u2208 C 1 it is possible to calculate the n \u00d7 n Jacobian matrix as here indicated with Jf . In term of the\nJacobian matrix, as given \u03c3(Jf ) the set of its eigenvalues, a theorem ensures that a steady\u2013state \u03be \u0303 \u2208 Rn for\nwhich J has no eigenvalues with zero real parts (hyperbolic steady\u2013state) is [9]:\n\u2022 asymptotically stable if and only if <\u03bb < 0, for all \u03bb \u2208 \u03c3(Jf ),\n\u2022 unstable if and only if <\u03bb > 0, for all \u03bb \u2208 \u03c3(Jf ).\nThe same is not true for a non\u2013hyperbolic steady\u2013state.\n\n3\n\nFinite Difference Approaches\n\nTo transform a continuous\u2013time model into a discrete one, the continuous variable t \u2208 [0, \u221e) must be\nreplaced by the discrete variable n \u2208 N and the variable \u03be must take discrete values \u03ben . The result is a\ndifference equation. Let f : Rn \u2212\u2192 Rn , consider a sequence {\u03ben }\u221e\nn=0 : it can be defined by a mapping\n\u039b : Rn \u00d7 Rn \u2212\u2192 Rn of the form H(\u03ben+1 , \u03ben ). In some case, such as the one discussed on this paper, is possible\nthat \u03ben+1 is given explicitly in terms of \u03ben :\n\u03ben+1 = F (\u03ben ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere F : A \u2286 Rn \u2212\u2192 Rn .\nFor a dynamical discrete system defined by eq. (3) a steady\u2013state \u03be \u0303n \u2208 Rn respects the following\nconditions:\nF (\u03be \u0303n ) = \u03be \u0303n .\n\n(4)\n\nLikewise to the continuous case, also in discrete case it is useful to define with \u0393d = {\u03be \u0303n |F (\u03be \u0303n ) = 0, \u03be \u0303n \u2208 Rn }\nthe set of steady\u2013states.\nTo check the stability of the system described by eq. (4) the procedure is similar to the continuous case.\nIf F \u2208 C 1 is possible to calculate the n \u00d7 n Jacobian matrix, indicated with JF . Given \u03c3(JF ) the set of the\nJacobian eigenvalues, a theorem (see i.e., [4]) ensures that a steady\u2013state \u03be \u0303n \u2208 Rn is:\n\u2022 locally asymptotically stable if and only if <\u03bb < 1 \u2200 \u03bb \u2208 \u03c3(JF ): this point is an attractor.\n\u2022 unstable if and only if <\u03bb > 1 \u2200\u03bb \u2208 \u03c3(JF ): this point is a repeller.\n\u2022 no conclusions on stability if <\u03bb > 1 for some \u03bb \u2208 \u03c3(JF ).\n\n2\n\n\fThe finite difference method is called elementary stable if, for any value of the time step \u2206t, the linear\nstability of each \u03be \u0303n \u2208 \u0393d is the same as the stability of each \u03be \u0303 \u2208 \u0393c .\nFrom a theoretical point of view this criterion is good in every case to control the stability of the\nsteady\u2013states. Nevertheless, in the case of multi\u2013dimensional systems, expecially in two and three dimensions,\nit is more convenient to use an alternative method, the so\u2013called Jury criterion [8]. Let J \u0303F := JF (\u03be \u0303n ), for\ntwo dimensional systems the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian can be written as:\n\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb tr(J \u0303F ) + det(J \u0303F ).\n\n(5)\n\nIn order to have <\u03bb < 1 for all \u03bb \u2208 \u03c3(JF ), the Jury condition states that:\n| tr(J \u0303F )| < 1 + det(J \u0303F ) < 2.\n\n(6)\n\nTherefore, this criterion establishes that exists a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the steady\u2013state solutions.\nThe Forward\u2013Euler Method. This is one of the oldest way to derive a finite difference equation from a\ndifferential equation. This numerical procedure requires that the system (1) is transformed by introducing\nthese substitutions:\n\u03be(t) \u2212\u2192 \u03ben ,\n\n(7)\n\nd\u03be(t)\n\u03ben+1 \u2212 \u03ben\n\u2212\u2192\n,\ndt\n\u2206t\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u2206t is the step size and \u03ben+1 \u2248 \u03be(t + n\u2206t). As showed by Mickens (see i.e., the reference [15]), in\nmany cases the transformation of eq. (8) leads to numerical instabilities which occur as solutions of the finite\ndifference equations, steady\u2013states, bifurcations etc. that do not appear in the originary differential equation.\n\n3.1\n\nNonstandard Finite Difference method\n\nTo avoid these potential problems, Mickens [11] suggests what is known as the Nonstandard Finite Difference\n(NSFD) method. An important concept on which the NSFD schemes is based is the Dynamic Consistency\n[16]. This criterion states that, let the first\u2013order autonomous ODE\nd\u03be\n= f (\u03be, k),\ndt\n\n(9)\n\nand given U its set of properties, the difference equation\n\u03ben+1 = F (\u03ben , k, \u2206t),\n\n(10)\n\nis dynamically consistent with (9) if it respects the same set of properties. As indicated in [1], the dynamic\nconsistency is verified when a difference equation possesses the same stability, bifurcations and chaos of the\noriginal differential equation.\nA finite difference method is called a NSFD scheme is almost one of the following conditions is satisfied:\nI. The order of the discrete derivative should be equal to the order of the corresponding derivatives of the\ndifferential equation.\nII. Denominator functions for the discrete rapresentation must be non\u2013trivial. The following replacement\nis then required:\n\u2206t \u2212\u2192 \u03c6(\u2206t) + O(\u2206t2 ),\nwhere \u03c6(\u2206t) is such that 0 < \u03c6(\u2206t) < 1, \u2200\u2206t > 0.\n\n3\n\n\fIII. Nonlinear terms must be replaced by non\u2013local discrete representations, i.e.,\n\u03be 2 \u2212\u2192 \u03ben \u03ben+1 .\nIV. Special conditions that hold for the solutions of the differential equations should also hold for the\nsolutions of the finite difference scheme.\nV. The scheme should not introduces spurious solutions.\nThe NSFD scheme incorporates the principle of Dynamical Consistency.\nA very important characteristic of dynamical systems, especially in those of biological interest, is that\nall solutions must remain non\u2013negative in order to maintain the problem well\u2013posed, from biological and\nmathematical points of view. A method that respects the Mickens rules (I to V) and preserves the solution\npositivity is called Positive and Elementary Stable Nonstandard (PESN) method. The appropriate non\u2013local\napproximation that provides a such scheme is constructed by using the indications suggested by Patankar [17].\nApplying these expedients, the discrete scheme will comply with the physical properties of the differential\nequations, without any restriction on the step size \u2206t.\n\n4\n\nAn Elementary Application: the Logistic Population Model\n\nThe logistic equation, originally due to Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst [20], is the law that regulates with good\napproximation the growth rate of a certain population number as function of time. The model is based on\nthe assumption that the population evolves in an environment with limited resources with no immigration or\nemigration phenomena. Let x(t) the population at instant t, the law that regulates it can be expressed from\nthe following first\u2013order autonomous ODE:\nrx2 (t)\ndx(t)\n= rx(t) \u2212\n,\n(11)\ndt\nE\nwhere E is the carrying capacity of the system and r is the intrinsic growth rate (r = b \u2212 d, where b is the\ninstantaneous birth rate and d the instantaneous death rate); also we assume r, k > 0. The eq. (11) is the\nsame as (1) assuming \u03be = x(t) and f coinciding with the right hand term. In this equation the term rx(t) is\nthe intrinsic population growth rate, while \u2212rx2 (t)/E is the self\u2013limitating term. These two factors of f\nhave opposite sign then f can be greater, lesser or equal to zero: this determines respectively the increase,\nthe decrease or the constancy of the population.\nApplying the condition dicted by eq. (2), is simple to calculate the two steady\u2013states: a trivial solution\nx\u03031 = 0 and a non\u2013trivial x\u03032 = E. Substituting these solutions in the Jacobian J(x) = 1 \u2212 2x/E the following\ninequalities J(x\u03031 ) > 0 and J(x\u03032 ) < 0 hold. We can deduce that only the solution x\u03032 = E is asymptotically\nstable.\nThis can be deduced also by an alternative way. The differential equation (11), solved by variables separation\ntechnique, admits the following solution:\nx(t) =\n\nE\nx0\n\n1+\n\nE\n\u0001\n.\n\u2212 1 e\u2212rt\n\n(12)\n\nCalculating the limit of eq. (12) for t \u2212\u2192 +\u221e the population has just E as its asymptotic value.\n\n4.1\n\nDiscrete model of logistic equation.\n\nFollowing the NSFD rules, the logistic model of eq. (11) can be transformed in the discrete scheme:\nrx2 (t)\n\u2206x(t)\n= rx(t) \u2212\n,\n\u03c6(\u2206t)\nE\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u2206x(t) = xn+1 \u2212 xn and \u03c6(\u2206t) is a function of the time step in respect of the rule II; in accord with\nrule III, x2 \u2212\u2192 xn xn+1 . Therefore xn+1 can be so explicited:\nxn+1 =\n\n1 + r\u03c6(\u2206t)\n1+\n\nr\u03c6(\u2206t)\nxn\nE\n\n4\n\nxn ,\n\n(14)\n\n\fwhere x0 = x(t = 0) is the initial population. It is simple to show that the condition of positiveness xn+1 \u2265 0\nis automatically satisfied if \u03c6 satisfy the rule II of the NSFD scheme. The steady\u2013states of eq. (14) are x\u03031 = 0\nand x\u03031 = E: for the trivial steady\u2013state, J(x\u03031 ) = 1 + r\u03c6 > 1 for r > 0 and 0 < \u03c6 < 1, then is unstable;\nfor the non trivial one, J(x\u03032 ) = 1/(1 + r\u03c6) < 1, then is asimptotically stable. We conclude that the NSFD\nscheme well reproduces the behavior of the differential equation (13).\nIn opposition, the Euler and Runge\u2013Kutta discretization methods are dynamically inconsistent with the\noriginal differential equation [12], showing numerical instabilities. Also in [2] is remarked that the application\nof these two standard schemes produces a not correct monotonicity and oscillations for particular values of\nthe mesh \u2206t.\n\n5\n\nMutualistic Interaction Between two Species\n\nIt is now considered a more complex case respect to the logistic equation: this is the formulation introduced\nby Holland and DeAngelis 2009 [5] for the mutualism description, based on Rosenzweig\u2013MacArthur model\nof predator\u2013prey interactions. After a brief review of the problem in continuous\u2013time domain, two discrete\nschemes will be proposed.\n\n5.1\n\nContinuous\u2013time domain\n\nSubsequently it will be denoted with x(t) and y(t) the numbers (or densities) of the mutualistic species. In a\nmutualistic model, the growth rate of each species must involves the same terms of the logistic equation (11)\nthat represent effect separate from mutualism: a linear term that represent the intrinsic population growth\nrate and a quadratic one to modify the growth rate with density dependent self\u2013limitation. Also, for each\nspecies, in case of bi\u2013directional mutualism, other two terms are required:\n\u2022 a positive term that quantify the advantages that the presence of a species induces on the growth of\nthe other (\u03b1ij in eq. (15)),\n\u2022 a negative term that describes the disadvantages that the presence of a species induces on the growth\nof the other (\u03b2i in eq. (15)).\nWith these two conditions, a community of two mutualistic species can be described by the following system\n[5]:\n\uf8f1 dx\nxy\nxy\n2\n\uf8f4\ndt = r1 x + \u03b112 h2 +y \u2212 \u03b21 e1 +x \u2212 d1 x\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\ndy\nxy\nxy\n2\n(15)\ndt = r2 y + \u03b121 h1 +x \u2212 \u03b22 e2 +y \u2212 d2 y\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nx(0) \u2265 0, y(0) \u2265 0,\nwhere all parameters are constants, real and non\u2013negative. To create correspondence with the notation of eq.\n(1), we assume k1 = (r1 , \u03b112 , h2 , \u03b21 , e1 , d1 ) and k2 = (r2 , \u03b121 , h1 , \u03b22 , e2 , d2 ).\n\n5.2\n\nDiscrete\u2013time domain\n\nForward\u2013Euler method.\n(15).

Now, we transform the differential equations in system (15) respecting the following NSFD\nrules:\n\u2022 II rule: denominators of left\u2013hand side are replaced with \u03c6 = \u03c6(\u2206t);\n\u2022 III rule and PESN criterion: the terms on the right of the equations are replaced with a non\u2013local\napproximation.\nThen, the resulting finite difference system is:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nxn+1 \u2212xn\n\u03c6(\u2206t)\n\nxn\nn+1\n= r1 xn + \u03b112 hy2n+y\n\u2212 \u03b21 yen1x+x\n\u2212 d1 xn xn+1\nn\nn\n\nyn+1 \u2212yn\n\u03c6(\u2206t)\n\nxn\nxn\n\u2212 \u03b22 yen+1\n\u2212 d2 yn yn+1\n= r2 yn + \u03b121 hy1n+x\nn\n2 +yn\n\n(19)\n\nx0 > 0, y0 > 0.\n\nThen they are calculated xn+1 and yn+1 :\n\uf8f1\nxn+1 = F1 (xn , yn , \u03c6, k1 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nyn+1 = F2 (xn , yn , \u03c6, k2 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nx0 > 0, y0 > 0,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere:\nF1 (xn , yn , \u03c6, k1 ) =\n\n(e1 + xn )(h2 + yn ) + \u03c6(e1 + xn )(r1 (h2 + yn ) + yn \u03b112 )\n,\n(e1 + xn )(h2 + yn ) + \u03c6(h2 + yn )(d1 xn (e1 + xn ) + yn \u03b21 )\n\n(21)\n\n(e2 + yn )(h1 + xn ) + \u03c6(e2 + yn )(r2 (h1 + xn ) + xn \u03b121 )\n,\n(22)\n(e2 + yn )(h1 + xn ) + \u03c6(h1 + xn )(d2 yn (e2 + yn ) + xn \u03b22 )\nin which k1 and k2 are the parameters already defined in Subsection 5.1. Since all components of k1 and k2\nare non\u2013negative S\nwe have xn+1 , yn+1 \u2265 0 for all n \u2265 0, guaranteeing the respect of the positiveness condition.\n \u0303 \u03c6 is given by the following expression [13]:\nIntroducing \u03a9 = \u03be\u0303\u2208\u0393d \u03c3(J),\nF2 (xn , yn , \u03c6, k2 ) =\n\n\u03c6(\u2206t) =\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212q\u2206t\n,\nq\n\n6\n\n(23)\n\n\fin which:\nq \u2265 max\n\nn\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u03bb2 o\nif <(\u03bb) 6= 0 for \u03bb \u2208 \u03a9.\n2|<(\u03bb)|\n\nFollowing the definition given in (4), the steady\u2013states are calculated by solving the below system:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 F1 (xn , yn , \u03c6, k1 ) = xn\n\uf8f3\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\nF2 (xn , yn , \u03c6, k2 ) = yn .\n\nTo discuss the stability of all \u03be \u0303n \u2208 \u0393d , it is convenient to check if the Jury condition mentioned in eq.

In this paper a unique simulation for steady\u2013state analysis is reported, hypothesizing for the\ninvolved parameters r1 , r2 , \u03b112 , \u03b121 , \u03b21 , \u03b22 , e1 , e2 , d1 and d2 the same values used by Holland and DeAngelis\n[5] for bi\u2013directional mutualism. The steady\u2013states have been calculated applying the condition (2) to the\nsystem of differential equation (15). From graphical point of view, the steady\u2013states are found plotting\nthe zero\u2013growth isoclines of each system's equation and are represented by the points where the isoclines\nintersect between them. The phase\u2013plane diagrams for the x\u2013y dynamics is showed in Figure 1a where the\nzero\u2013growth isoclines are depicted.\nIn the discrete case, NSFD derived scheme has been compared with the Euler one calculating the\nsolutions of the systems (25) and (18) respectively. The Figure 1b represents the isoclines described by the\nEuler and NSFD schemes for \u2206t = 10\u22123 . From those graphs can be seen that, for the assumed parameters,\nthe dynamical system has 6 steady\u2013states, indicated with \u03930 , \u03931 ,.., \u03935 in counterclockwise sense. Also,\nnone of the two discretization methods introduces spurious solutions: the coordinates of the steady\u2013states\nare the same and the isoclined are perfectly superimposed. The Table 1 summarizes the results of these\nsimulations and the conclusions on steady\u2013states stability for continuous and discrete\u2013time schemes. From\nthe examination of the signs of the eigenvalues, it emerges that \u03930 , \u03932 and \u03934 are repellers (indicated in\nfigure with a black square) and \u03931 , \u03933 and \u03935 are attractors (black circle).\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 1: Comparison between phase\u2013plane diagrams for continuous\u2013time and discrete\u2013time cases. (a) Zero\u2013growth isoclines\nfor system of eq. (15) are represented as black (dx/dt = 0) and red (dy/dt = 0) lines. (b) Zero\u2013growth isoclines come from\nthe system (25): black dotted line for first equation and red dotted line for the second equation; zero\u2013growth isoclines come\nfrom system (18): in blue the first equation and in green the second one (completely superimposed to the NSFD lines). For the\ndiscretization parameters, the following values have been used: \u2206t = 10\u22123 , q = 10. The steady\u2013states are marked with letters\n\u03930 to \u03935 : the squares (\u03930 , \u03932 , \u03934 ) indicate the repellers of the system as well as the circles (\u03931 , \u03933 , \u03935 ) indicate the attractors.\nThe value assigned at each parameter is [5]: r1 = r2 = 0.3, \u03b112 = \u03b121 = 0.6, q1 = q2 = 1, \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 0.2, d1 = d2 = 0.01,\nh1 = h2 = 0.3 and e1 = e2 = 0.3.\n\nSteady\u2013state\n\u03930\n\u03931\n\u03932\n\u03933\n\u03934\n\u03935\n\nx\u2013coordinate\n0\n30\n25.62\n69.83\n83.17\n0\n\ny\u2013coordinate\n0\n0\n83.17\n69.83\n25.62\n30\n\n\u03bb1\n0.30\n-19.11\n-0.80\n-0.70\n-0.80\n-19.11\n\n\u03bb2\n0.30\n-0.30\n0.41\n-0.30\n0.41\n-0.30\n\nStability\nR\nA\nR\nA\nR\nA\n\nTable 1: Steady\u2013states of Figure 1.

Each curve is related to at\nleast one of the steady\u2013states \u03930 , \u03931 , ..., \u03935 . (b) Plot of eq. (28) versus \u2206t.\n\n8\n\n\fHowever, when \u2206t is increased up to 8.445 * 10\u22122 we observe that the Euler scheme converges toward\nwrong steady\u2013states or the two populations have a boundless growth. On the contrary the phase\u2013plane of\nthe NSFD remains unchanged.\nSince one of the requisites for the dynamic consistence is the invariance of the stability conditions\nregardless to the discretization step\u2013size, has been checked for NSFD scheme if the Jury condition is guaranteed\nor not independently from the value of \u2206t. This check is not performed for Euler scheme because, as explained\nabove, it fails the convergence to the correct fixed points for certain values of the step\u2013size.\nIn order to verify this, the condition (6) is splitted in two inequalities that will be proved for all \u03be \u0303 \u2208 \u0393d ,\nmaking explicit the dependence of the Jacobian elements from \u2206t:\n \u0303\ndet(J(\u2206t))\n\u2212 1 < 0,\n\n(27)\n\n \u0303\n \u0303\ndet(J(\u2206t))\n+ 1 \u2212 tr(J(\u2206t))\n> 0.\n\n(28)\n\nThe Figures 2a and 2b represent respectively the left term of eq. (27) and (28), both evaluated as function\nof \u2206t: in both graphs every curve is related to at least one steady\u2013state \u03930 , \u03931 , ..., \u03935 . Only for reasons of\ncorrect graphic visualization the two figures have different scales on abscissa. It is easy to see that both the\ninequalities (27) and (28) are satisfied for NSFD schemes only from \u03931 , \u03933 and \u03935 steady\u2013states for each\nvalue of \u2206t represented. Nevertheless, has been checked that all the curves are monotone for 0 < \u2206t \u2264 10,\nthen the conclusions about the steady\u2013states stability are unchanged up to \u2206t = 10.\n\n6.2\n\nTransient dynamics\n\nIn this Section a transient analysis has been performed with the purpose to emphasize the possible criticalities\nof the two considered discretization schemes.\nThe phase\u2013plane portraits of NSFD and Forward\u2013Euler difference equations has been shown in Figure 3a\nand b respectively: all the used parameters are the same used for computation of Figure 1, exception for\nthe time step that now is \u2206t = 6 * 10\u22122 . From the comparison it is possible to observe some differences\nhighlighted by red rectangles in the Figure 3b named with D1 and D2 . The subplots 3c and d represent the\nmagnification of what happens in D1 and D2 respectively: it is possible to note that in subdomain D1 the\npopulation x assumes negative values for about y \u2265 45 and the population y assumes negative values for\nabout x \u2265 45. All these negative values appear during the transient.\nThe Figures 4a and c show a plot of the populations vs the iteration number using respectively (17)\nand (20) schemes. In order to show as the numerical instabilities arise for larger values of \u2206t a comparison\nbetween Euler and NSFD schemes has been performed by assuming respectively \u2206t = 10\u22123 (see Figure 4a)\nand 8.44 * 10\u22122 (see Figure 4c) with initial populations (x0 , y0 ) = (30, 10). It can be seen from the Figure\n4a that for both Euler and NSFD equations, after a transient in which the populations x and y reach their\nmaximum values, about 72 and 11 individuals, they converge smoothly toward x = 30 and y = 0 individuals\n(steady\u2013state \u03931 ). The relative phase\u2013plane is depicted in the Figure 4b, where the two trajectories are\nperfectly superimposed. By increasing the time step up to \u2206t = 8.44 * 10\u22122 the populations behave as\nin Figure 4c, calculated keeping all other parameters unchanged. The remarkable fact is that, while for\nNSFD the transient preserves the same aspect of Figure 4a, the Euler scheme shows jumps for both x and y\npopulations around the 40th iteration and an anomalous behavior that also continues in later iterations. In\nFigure 4d is plotted the relative phase\u2013plane where the difference between NSFD and Euler trajectories are\nparticularly evident; also note the difference of the Euler trajectories between the subplots b and d.\nFrom the tests that have been performed it is possible to infer that the first numerical instabilities in\nForward\u2013Euler scheme occur when \u2206t overcomes the critical value of \u2206tc ' 5 * 10\u22122 . The reason is that\nin Forward\u2013Euler the step sizes larger than \u2206tc are greater than some characteristic time relevant of this\nphysical problem. The same is not true employing the NSFD technique, in which the numerical instabilities\nare eliminated since the selected step size of eq. (23) is never larger than the smallest time scale of the system.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nOn the base of the work published by Holland and DeAngelis in 2009, in which is constructed and analyzed a\npopulation dynamic continuous\u2013time model linking the consumer functional responses of one mutualistic\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 3: (a) Phase\u2013plane portrait of system (20).

As shown by numerical simulations, the NSFD framework\nreproduces the dynamical features of the continuous\u2013time analogous. In particular, it is proved that the\nmethod guarantees the correct asymptotic behavior regardless from the size of the time step. It was shown\nthat, with the same initial conditions, the Forward\u2013Euler induces scheme\u2013dependent numerical instabilities\nfor \u2206t greater than a critical values, that manifest as jumps in the population evolution in time domain\nand convergence toward wrong steady\u2013state solutions. On the other hand, in tests that were performed, the\nNSFD scheme shows none of these problems, confirming the versatility of the method.\n\nReferences\n[1] H. Al\u2013Kahby, F. Dannan, and S.
