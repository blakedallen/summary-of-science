We derive averaged equations that include induced\ncubic nonlinearities and numerically find previously unknown soliton families. The inclusion of the\ninduced cubic terms enables us to show that solitons still exist even when the effective quadratic\nnonlinearity vanishes and conventional theory predicts that there can be no soliton. We demonstrate\nthat both bright and dark forms of these solitons are stable under propagation.\n\nSolitons exist in 1D QNPCs with a nonlinear QPM\ngrating [14], but a simultaneous linear grating can reduce\nthe effective \u03c7(2) nonlinearity [7\u20139]. Thus the global existence of solitons in such QNPCs is nontrivial. Building\non previous findings that nonlinear QPM gratings induce\ncubic nonlinearities [14], we find soliton solutions that are\nstable under propagation. The induced cubic terms provide an elegant means of showing that, against intuition,\nthe QNPC supports stable bright and dark solitons even\nwhen there is no effective \u03c7(2) nonlinearity. This is analogous to the existence of solitons in dispersion-managed\nfibres with no average dispersion [15].\n\nThe physics and applications of photonic band-gap\n(PBG) materials, or photonic crystals, have been active\ntopics of research for more than a decade. The theory\nof linear photonic crystals is now well understood, and\nmany of their fundamental properties and technical applications have been characterized [1]. The next important step in the application of photonic crystals is to create tunable PBGs. Tunability is possible in linear photonic crystals through, e.g., the temperature dependence\nof the refractive index [2] or the electro-optic effect [3].\nUltrafast dynamical tunability of the PBG can be accomplished using nonlinearity, as was first demonstrated\nwith a constant Kerr nonlinearity [4].\nHere we consider quadratic nonlinear photonic crystals\n(QNPCs) that have a linear grating (periodic dielectric\nconstant) and/or a nonlinear grating (periodic secondorder or \u03c7(2) susceptibility). QNPCs are of interest for\nall-optical components due to the fast and strong nonlinearity they can provide through the parametric cascading\neffect [5]. The efficiency of the cascading process depends\ncritically on the phase mismatch between the fundamental and second-harmonic (SH) waves, but two powerful\nmethods exist that use exactly a periodic photonic crystal\nstructure to control the mismatch [6\u20139]. In one method,\na QNPC with a linear Bragg grating is used to bend the\ndispersion curve near the PBG [7,10]. However, the short\nperiod, which is of the order of the optical wavelength,\ncan be inconvenient. The second scheme, quasi-phasematching (QPM), controls the phase mismatch [6,9] using a nonlinear grating with a period equal to the comparatively long beat length (typically of the order of microns). QPM is also possible with linear gratings, but\nthis is much less effective [7,8].\nOne of the spectacular manifestations of nonlinearity\nis the soliton, a self-localized entity that can propagate\nunchanged over long distances. Homogeneous \u03c7(2) materials support solitons in all dimensions [11], and gap\nsolitons exist in QNPCs with a linear Bragg grating [12].\nIn this Letter we focus on the open fundamental problem\nof whether solitons exist in 1D QNPCs with both a linear\nand a nonlinear QPM grating. Such a simultaneous linear\ngrating is difficult to avoid when, for example, creating\nnonlinear QPM gratings in GaAs/AlAs semiconductors\nthrough quantum-well disordering [13].\n\nFIG. 1. Geometry of the 1D QNPC in the form of a \u03c7(2)\nslab waveguide. Black and white domains indicate regions\nwith different dielectric constant and \u03c7(2) coefficient.\n\nWe consider the interaction of a cw beam (carrier\nfrequency \u03c9) with its SH, propagating in a lossless\n1D QNPC under conditions for type I second-harmonic\ngeneration (SHG), as sketched in Fig. 1. We assume\nthat the modulation of the refractive index is weak\n(\u2206nj (z)/n\u0304j \u226a1, where nj (z)=n\u0304j + \u2206nj (z) and j refers\nto the frequency j\u03c9), and we consider only gratings for\nforward QPM. The grating period is then much longer\nthan the optical period, in which case Bragg reflections\ncan be neglected. The evolution of the slowly varying\nbeam envelopes is then described by [6,16]\n\u2202w 1 \u2202 2 w\n+ \u03b11 (z)w + \u03c7(z)w\u2217 vei\u03b2z = 0,\n+\n\u2202z\n2 \u2202x2\n\u2202v 1 \u2202 2 v\n+ 2\u03b12 (z)v + \u03c7(z)w2 e\u2212i\u03b2z = 0,\n+\ni\n\u2202z\n4 \u2202x2\n\ni\n\n(1)\n\nwhere w=w(x, z) and v=v(x, z) are the envelope functions of the fundamental and SH, respectively. The trans1\n\n\fwn6=0 = (a1 gn w0 + dgn\u22121 w0\u2217 v0 )/(n\u03ba),\n\nverse and propagation coordinates x and z are in units\nof the input beam width x0 and the diffraction length\nLd =k1 x20 , respectively. The parameter \u03b2=\u2206kLd is proportional to the mismatch \u2206k=k2 -2k1 , kj =j\u03c9n\u0304j /c being the average wavenumber. Thus \u03b2 is positive for\nnormal dispersion and negative for anomalous dispersion. The normalized refractive index grating is given by\n\u03b1j (z)=Ld \u03c9\u2206nj (z)/c and the normalized nonlinear grating by \u03c7(z)=Ld \u03c9deff (z)/(n\u03041 c), where deff =\u03c7(2) /2 is given\nin MKS units. The model (1) describes both temporal\nand spatial solitons [16].\n\nvn6=0 = (2a2 gn v0 + dgn+1 w02 )/(n\u03ba).\n\n(4)\n\nUsing these solutions, we obtain to first order \u01eb the averaged equations for the DC components w0 and v0 :\n1 \u2202 2 w0\n\u2202w0\n+ \u03c1w0\u2217 v0 + \u03b3(|v0 |2 \u2212 |w0 |2 )w0 = 0,\n+\n\u2202z\n2 \u2202x2\n\u2202v0\n1 \u2202 2 v0\ni\n+ \u03b2\u0303v0 + \u03c1\u2217 w02 + 2\u03b3|w0 |2 v0 = 0.\n(5)\n+\n\u2202z\n4 \u2202x2\n\ni\n\nThese equations also describe mth order QPM (where\n\u03b2\u0303=\u03b2 \u2212 m\u03ba is ideally zero) and any other type of periodic grating, the parameters \u03c1 and \u03b3 being simply given\nas sums over the Fourier coefficients of the grating [14].\nIncorporating time or the spatial y coordinate is also\nstraightforward. For the square grating (2), \u03c1 and \u03b3 can\nbe explicitly calculated to\n\u03c1=i\n\nFrom Eqs. (5) follows the important result that cubic\nnonlinearities are induced in QNPCs by nonlinear QPM\ngratings. This cubic nonlinearity has the form of selfand cross-phase modulation (SPM and XPM), and is a\nresult of non-phase-matched coupling between the wave\nat the main spatial frequency \u03ba and its higher harmonics. It is thus of a fundamentally different nature than\nthe material Kerr nonlinearity, which is reflected in the\nfact that the SPM term is absent for the SH.\nThe averaged model (5) is identical to the known\nmodel for nonlinear QPM gratings with no DC component (aj =d0 =0), for which simulations confirmed that\nbright solitons had properties that were not predicted by\nthe conventional model with only quadratic terms, but\nwere accurately described with the inclusion of the cubic\nterms [14]. It was further shown that the induced cubic\nnonlinearity affects the phase modulation of cw waves,\nenabling efficient switching [17], and that its strength\ncan be increased by modulating the grating [18].\nFor the more general QNPCs considered here, the induced cubic nonlinearity depends on both the DC part\nand the modulation part of the nonlinear grating, but is\nindependent of the linear grating. The cubic terms may\nlead to either a focusing or a defocusing effect, depending on the relative intensity of the fields and the sign\nof the phase mismatch \u03b2, since sign(\u03ba) = sign(\u03b2). The\nstrength of the effective \u03c7(2) nonlinearity depends on the\ndifference in the linear grating strengths at the fundamental and SH frequencies and on the DC component of\nthe nonlinear grating. We thus recover the well-known\neffect that the interplay between the linear and nonlinear gratings can increase or decrease the effective \u03c7(2)\nnonlinearity, depending on the physical situation [7,8].\nThe averaged model (5) has stationary, localised soliton solutions of the form w0 (x, z)=ei\u03bbz w\u0303(x)/|\u03c1| and\nv0 (x, z)=e2i\u03bbz \u1e7d(x)/\u03c1, which obey the equations\n\nFIG. 2. Normalized linear and quadratic nonlinear gratings, \u03b1j (z) and \u03c7(z), with period 2L0 =2\u03c0/|\u03ba|.\n\nThe aim is now to average Eqs. (1) and derive accurate\nequations for the average field. To do so we focus on first\norder QPM using the conventional square gratings with\n50% duty cycle, shown in Fig. 2. We expand the grating\nfunctions in Fourier series:\nX\nX\n\u03b1j (z) = aj\ngn ein\u03baz , \u03c7(z) = d0 + d\ngn ein\u03baz , (2)\nn\n\nn\n\nwhere gn =2s/(i\u03c0n) for n odd and gn =0 for n even, with\ns = sign(\u03ba). The gratings drive the system, which means\nthat we may expand the envelope functions in Fourier\nseries also:\nX\nX\nw=\nwn (z, x)ein\u03baz , v =\nvn (z, x)ei(n\u03ba\u2212\u03b2\u0303)z , (3)\nn\n\n4d0 (a1 \u2212 a2 )\nd2 + d2 (1 \u2212 8/\u03c0 2 )\n2d\n+i\n, \u03b3= 0\n. (6)\ns\u03c0\ns\u03c0\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\nn\n\nassuming that the coefficients wn (z, x) and vn (z, x) vary\nslowly in z compared to exp(i\u03baz). The residual mismatch\n\u03b2\u0303=\u03b2 \u2212 \u03ba is ideally zero.\nThree physical length scales are in play: the diffraction length Ld , the coherence length Lc , and the grating\ndomain length L0 . In normalized units Ld =1, Lc =\u03c0/|\u03b2|,\nand L0 =\u03c0/|\u03ba|. We assume a typical QPM grating with\na domain length that is much shorter than the diffraction length, L0 \u226a1. Furthermore, the grating is of good\nquality, with the domain length being close to the coherence length, L0 \u2243Lc , so the residual mismatch is small,\n|\u03b2\u0303|\u226a|\u03ba|. In this case |\u03ba|\u226b1 and we can use perturbation\ntheory with the small parameter \u01eb=1/|\u03ba| \u226a 1.\nFollowing the approach of Ref. [14], we insert the\nFourier expansions (2) and (3) into the dynamical equations and assume the harmonics wn6=0 and vn6=0 to be of\norder \u01eb. To lowest order (\u01eb1 ), this gives the harmonics\n2\n\n\f1 \u2202 2 w\u0303\n\u2212 \u03bbw\u0303 + w\u0303\u1e7d + \u03b3\u0303(\u1e7d 2 \u2212 w\u03032 )w\u0303 = 0,\n2 \u2202x2\n1 \u2202 2 \u1e7d\n+ (\u03b2\u0303 \u2212 2\u03bb)\u1e7d + w\u03032 + 2\u03b3\u0303 w\u03032 \u1e7d = 0,\n4 \u2202x2\n\nof Eqs. (7) using a standard relaxation technique. Bright\nsoliton properties were investigated in [14], but not for\nnormal dispersion, \u03b3\u0303 > 0. In Fig. 4 we present the properties for normal (\u03b3\u0303=0.02) and anomalous (\u03b3\u0303=\u22120.02) dispersion, together with the zeroth-order solution (\u03b3\u0303=0).\nThe ratio R = \u1e7d 2 (0)/w\u03032 (0) of peak intensities, shown in\nFig. 4(a), confirms that the zeroth-order approximation\nbecomes increasingly inaccurate for large \u03bb. Also, for a\ngiven \u03b3\u0303, R approaches the same limiting value as \u03bb increases, regardless of the value of \u03b2\u0303. In this limit the\nSH is stronger than the fundamental for \u03b3\u0303 > 0 (R > 1)\nandRmuch weaker for \u03b3\u0303 < 0 (R \u2243 0). The total power\n\u221e\nP = \u2212\u221e (\u1e7d 2 + w\u03032 )dx is shown in Fig. 4(b). For \u03b2 > 0 this\nreveals the interesting property that the power threshold\nfor existence, decreases for \u03b3\u0303 > 0 and increases for \u03b3\u0303 < 0,\nas compared to the zeroth-order value.\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b3\u0303=\u03b3/|\u03c1|2 depends only on \u03ba, a1 \u2212 a2 , and d0 /d.\nThe slowly varying approximation gives valid solutions\nwhen the soliton period is longer than the grating period,\ni.e. when the soliton parameter \u03bb is small, |\u03bb| \u226a |\u03ba|.\nIt is important to stress that Eqs.

A given value of the parameter\n\u03b3\u0303 represents a range of physical situations with different\ncombinations of linear and nonlinear gratings. In Fig. 3\nwe illustrate representative combinations for exact phase\nmatching (\u03b2\u0303=0) that all give the same value of \u03b3\u0303.\n4\nf=26.6\n\n2\n\n0.9\n\nf=48.5\n\nf=1\n\n1\n\nIntensity ratio, R\n\n\u03c7 /d and \u03b1 j /a j\n\n1\n\n3\n\n0\n\u22121\ndistance\n\nFIG. 3. QNPCs with the same value of \u03b3\u0303. The linear (nonlinear) grating is shown with a dashed (solid) curve.\n\nThe first, simple case (f =1) is typical for domain inversion in ferroelectric materials, such as LiNbO3 . It\nhas only a nonlinear grating that flips from positive to\nnegative with no DC component, d0 =0. The second\ncase has a DC level of \u03c7(2) nonlinearity, d0 /d=3, but\nno linear grating, corresponding to the nonlinear part of\nthe LiNbO3 /H:LiNbO3 structure reported in [19]. The\nthird case is the GaAs/GaAlAs structure reported in [19],\nwhich has a nonlinear grating with d0 /d=5/3 and a linear\ngrating with (a1 \u2212a2 )/\u03b2=\u22120.07. For the second and third\ncases to give the same \u03b3\u0303 as the first, the grating wavenumber \u03ba must be multiplied by f =48.5 and f =26.6, respectively. Physically this can be done by changing the input\nbeam width x0 , thus maintaining \u03b2\u0303=0.\n3\n\n100\n\n(a)\n\nTotal power, P\n\nIntensity ratio, R\n\n3\n2\n1 0\n0\n0\n\n\u22123\n5\nSoliton parameter,\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nThe bright soliton solutions of the average model (5)\nwere tested for the three QNPCs of Fig. 3 by mapping\nthem back to the variables w and v, and using them\nas initial conditions in simulations of the field Eqs. (1).\nThe evolution consists of small, regular oscillations superimposed on the slow average beam. Properties of the\npropagating solitons were calculated by averaging over\nan integer number of grating periods and were then compared with the predictions of the average model. Figure\n5 displays the ratio of peak intensities versus \u03bb for exact\nphase matching, \u03b2\u0303=0, and reveals that, for both anomalous and normal dispersion, the solutions of the average\nmodel are accurate for small \u03bb and large |\u03ba|, as expected.\nEven when |\u03ba|=4 the first-order solutions provide a much\nbetter fit than the zeroth-order solutions. Our analysis\nthus shows that bright solitons exist and propagate stably\nin QNPCs with many types and combinations of linear\nand nonlinear QPM gratings.\n\n3\n0\n1\n\n0.4\n\nSoliton Parameter, \u03bb\nFIG. 5.

Even with no effective quadratic\nnonlinearity, the QNPCs support both bright and dark\nsolitons due to the induced cubic nonlinearity. We have\nfound analytical expressions for these solitons and shown\nthat they propagate in a stable manner.\nDark solitons are always unstable in homogeneous \u03c7(2)\nmedia in settings for type I SHG, due to modulational instability of the back-ground plane-waves [20]. Our results\nshow, for the first time, a dark soliton that appears to\nbe stable under propagation, with the stabilizing mechanism necessarily originating from the photonic crystal\nstructure of the QNPC. An analysis of dark solitons in\nthe general case is being carried out.\nThe project is supported by the Danish Technical Research Council through Talent Grant No. 9800400.\n\nHowever, this is provided one is careful and does not\neliminate the effective \u03c7(2) nonlinearity by using a grating with \u03ba=2(a2 \u2212 a1 )d0 /d. This could happen in realistic QNPCs without violating the assumption |\u03ba| \u226b 1.\nFor the LiNbO3 and GaP/AIP structures given in [19]\nat phase matching (\u03ba=\u03b2), the presence of the linear\ngrating changes the effective \u03c7(2) nonlinearity by a factor of F =1 + 2d0 (a1 \u2212 a2 )/(d\u03ba)=1.4 and 0.3, respectively. The linear grating thus adds constructively in the\nLiNb03 structure and destructively in GaP/AIP. In fact,\nmodifying the nonlinear grating in the GaP/AIP struc(2)\n(2)\nture slightly to \u03c7a =40pm/V (max.) and \u03c7b =19pm/V\n(2)\n(min.) eliminates the effective \u03c7 nonlinearity entirely.\nConventional average models [7\u20139] would predict that\nno soliton could exist with no nonlinearity, \u03c1=0. However, in the model (5) the induced cubic nonlinearity predicts that solitons should still exist as solutions\nof nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations.\nIn the case when\n\u221a\n\u03bb/2)z]), a\nthe SH is strong (v0 /w0 = p 5 exp[i(\u03b2\u0303 \u2212 \u221a\nfamily of bright solitons, w0 = \u03bb/(2\u03b3) sech( 2\u03bbx)ei\u03bbz ,\nexists for normal dispersion\n(\u03b3, \u03bb>0),pand a family\np\n\u03bb/(4\u03b3) tanh( |\u03bb|x)ei\u03bbz , exof dark solitons, w0 =\nists for anomalous dispersion\n(\u03b3, \u03bb<0).\nWith no SH,\n\u221a\np\nbright solitons, w0 = 2\u03bb/|\u03b3| sech( 2\u03bbx)ei\u03bbz , exist for\nanomalous\np dispersion\np (\u03b3<0,\u03bb>0), whereas dark solitons,\nw0 = |\u03bb|/\u03b3tanh( |\u03bb|x)ei\u03bbz , exist for normal dispersion (\u03b3>0,\u03bb<0). We test these solutions by mapping\nthem back to the variables w and v and launching them\nas initial conditions in simulations of the field Eqs.
