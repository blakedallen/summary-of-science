Introduction\nThe Symmetric Space Sine-Gordon (SSSG) theories have received recent attention\nbecause they are relativistic integrable theories that are classically equivalent, via\nthe Polhmeyer reduction [1]1 , to the world-sheet theories of strings on symmetric\nspace spacetimes [3\u20135]. The SSSG theories for the cases where the symmetric space\nF/G is either S n or CP n have been shown to have soliton solutions which are the\nimages of the string giant magnons under the reduction [6\u201312]. Recently, the exact\nS-matrix for the solitons was conjectured for the complex projective spaces in [13].\nSymmetric spaces are characterized by a quotient of groups F/G and the existence\nof an isometry of F whose stability group is G. However, in order to describe the\nstring world sheet theory for AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 with all the fermionic degrees-of-freedom,\none needs to generalize the SSSG theories to the case where the symmetric space is\nreplaced by a semi-symmetric space F /G which is the quotient of a supergroup with\nan ordinary group associated to a Z4 automorphism with G the subgroup fixed by\nthe automorphism [14] (see also [15]).2 For AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 , the relevant semi-symmetric\nspace is\nP SU(2, 2|4)\nF\n=\n.\nG\nSp(2, 2) \u00d7 Sp(4)\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe bosonic part of this space is precisely\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 \u223c\n\nSO(2, 4) SO(6)\nSU(2, 2) SU(4)\n\u00d7\n\u223c\n\u00d7\n,\nSO(1, 4) SO(5)\nSp(2, 2)\nSp(4)\n\n(1.2)\n\nand it has been shown that the associated semi-symmetric space sine-Gordon (SSSSG)\ntheory now involves fermions [16]. The present work will investigate the two particular examples of these theories, the one above which is, of course central to the\ngauge-gravity correspondence, and the simpler case,\nF\nP SU(1, 1|2)\n=\n,\nG\nU(1) \u00d7 U(1)\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhose bosonic part is\nAdS2 \u00d7 S 2 \u223c\n\nSO(2, 1) SO(3)\nSU(1, 1) SU(2)\n\u00d7\n\u223c\n\u00d7\n.\nSO(1, 1) SO(2)\nU(1)\nU(1)\n\n(1.4)\n\nThe motivation behind the discovery and investigation of the SSSSG theories, is the\nquestion of whether the classical equivalence may extend to quantum equivalence\n1\n\nFor a recent review see [2] and references therein\nIn this paper we use the common nomenclature where Sp(2n) has rank n. However, in the\ncompanion paper we use the nomenclature that Sp(n) has rank n.\n2\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f[16, 17] (see also [18\u201323]). We keep an open mind about this question, but take the\nview that answering it will require the quantum solution of these theories and this\nis the problem that we now address.\nIt is a key result of [16] that the SSSSG theories are classically integrable and\nthey admit a zero-curvature, or Lax representation, whose algebraic setting involve a\nvery particular affinization of f, the Lie algebra of the supergroup F , built from the Z4\nautomorphism. The fact that there is a proper algebraic setting is key for us because\nit allows us to generalize various constructions that are used to solve the bosonic\ntheories. To start with, we use it to prove that these theories have an infinite tower\nof conserved charges, some of which can be related directly to conserved currents local\nin the Lagrangian fields. The construction here generalizes the same analysis for the\nordinary, or bosonic, SSSG theories that appears in the companion papers [24,25]. In\nparticular, we show that the SSSSG theories have Grassmann conserved charges of\nLorentz spin \u00b1 21 which are Noether symmetries of the action. These symmetries are\ncandidate supersymmetries, although for the P SU(2, 2|4) example the symmetries\nhave a non-local action on some of the fields (which explains why they have not\nbeen found before). We then go further and show that in certain cases, including\nthe P SU(2, 2|4) and P SU(1, 1|2) examples, those charges generate a closed extended\nSUSY algebra which includes the energy and momentum and, for the P SU(2, 2, |4),\na non-abelian SU(2)\u00d74 global symmetry which plays the r\u00f4le of an R-symmetry. For\nthe P SU(2, 2|4) case this extended SUSY algebra is a double central extension of\nthe form\n\u0001\n\u0001\ns = psu(2|2) \u2295 psu(2|2) \u22c9 R \u2295 R ,\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhich is very closely related to the symmetry algebra of the dyonic giant magnons\non the string theory side [26\u201328]. However, unlike in the string context, here it is a\nspacetime symmetry that includes the generators corresponding to two-dimensional\nspacetime translations as the central extension R \u2295 R \u223c \u2202+ \u2295 \u2202\u2212 . Each psu(2|2)\nfactor has 8 Grassmann generators and so there are N = (8, 8) supersymmetries in\ntotal.\nWe then go on, following the companion paper [24], to construct soliton solutions in the SSSSG theories using the dressing method. What is interesting is that,\nin this case, it leads to soliton solutions with both bosonic and Grassmann collective coordinates. If the Grassmann coordinates are turned off then the solitons live\nentirely in the S 5 or S 2 factor, and so one can view the Grassmann coordinates as\narising from the non-compact AdS5 sector. For P SU(2, 2|4) these solitons take the\nform of non-abelian Q-balls and in the string theory side correspond to dyonic giant\nmagnons [25]. We shall calculate the charges of the solitons, including the mass,\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fand argue that the solitons carry an internal moduli space which takes the form of a\nco-adjoint orbit of the SUSY group SU(2|2)\u00d72 .\nIn the final section, we proceed, once again following [24, 25], to a semi-classical\nquantization of the solitons by quantizing their moduli space dynamics. The idea here\nis to allow the collective coordinates to become time dependent and then substitute\nthis into the action and perform the spatial integral. What remains is an effective\nquantum mechanical theory on the moduli space. The Grassmann coordinates lead\nto a fermionic Fock space. For the P SU(2, 2|4) case, the bosonic part of the moduli\nspace is a co-adjoint orbit of the Grassmann even subgroup SU(2)\u00d74 \u2282 SU(2|2)\u00d72\nand leads to a Hilbert space which are particular representations of SU(2)\u00d74 . The\nbosonic and fermionic states match up in such a way that they form the atypical\nsymmetric representations for each SU(2|2).\nNear the completion of this work, there appeared [29] which also discusses the\nSUSY of the symmetric space sine-Gordon theories. Our approach has some overlap\nin that we find that off-shell the SUSY transformations also have a non-local component, however the details are different in that we do not need to modify the original\ntheory.\n\n2. The Semi-Symmetric Space Sine-Gordon Theories\nFor the case of ordinary groups, the SSSG theories are related to a triplet of groups\nH \u2282 G \u2282 F , where F/G is the symmetric space in question. The group in the\nnumerator F admits an involution \u03c3\u2212 whose stabilizer is the subgroup G. Acting on\nthe Lie algebra of F , the involution gives rise to the canonical decomposition\nf = g \u2295 p with [g, g] \u2282 g ,\n\n[g, p] \u2282 p ,\n\n[p, p] \u2282 g ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere g and p are the +1 and \u22121 eigenspaces of \u03c3\u2212 , respectively. This structure\ngives rise to the loop, or affine, algebra\nM\n\u0001\nz 2n \u2297 g + z 2n+1 \u2297 p ,\nf\u0302 =\n(2.2)\nn\u2208Z\n\nwhich plays an important role in the study of these theories. The SSSG equations can\nbe written in Lax form as a zero curvature condition for a connection that depends\non an auxiliary complex parameter z, which is a spectral parameter. Said another\nway, the connection is actually valued in the affine Lie algebra f\u0302. More explicitly, the\nSSSG equations are\n[L\u03bc (z), L\u03bd (z)] = 0 ,\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fwhere\nL+ (z) = \u2202+ + \u03b3 \u22121 \u2202+ \u03b3 + \u03b3 \u22121 A+ \u03b3 \u2212 z\u039b ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nL\u2212 (z) = \u2202\u2212 + A\u2212 \u2212 z \u22121 \u03b3 \u22121 \u039b\u03b3 .\n\nHere, \u039b is an element of the the \u22121 eigenspace p of the Lie algebra of F under \u03c3\u2212 ,\nand \u03b3 takes values in G. The gauge connection A\u00b1 is associated to the vector-like\ngauge symmetry generated by the subgroup H \u2282 G which commutes with \u039b:\n\u03b3 \u2212\u2192 U\u03b3U \u22121 ,\n\n\u0001\nA\u00b1 \u2212\u2192 U A\u00b1 + \u2202\u00b1 U \u22121 ,\n\nU \u2208H .\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe Lagrangian formulation of the SSSG equations was originally proposed in [30].\nThey arise as the Lagrange equations of the action\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nk\nd2 x Tr \u039b\u03b3 \u22121 \u039b\u03b3 ,\n(2.6)\nS[\u03b3, A\u03bc ] = SgWZW [\u03b3, A\u03bc ] \u2212\n\u03c0\nwhere SgWZW [\u03b3, A\u03bc ] is the usual WZW action for the gauged WZW model for G/H,\nand the integer number k is the level.\nThe structure above has been generalized to the case of a semi-symmetric space\nF/G in [16, 18], and here we shall consider the examples\nP SU(2, 2|4)\nSp(2|2) \u00d7 Sp(4)\n\nP SU(1, 1|2)\n.\nU(1) \u00d7 U(1)\n\nand\n\n(2.7)\n\nThe numerator group F is now a supergroup, and the r\u00f4le of the involution is played\nby a Z4 automorphism \u03c3\u2212 . Our conventions for superalgebras are taken from [31].\nFirst of all, the superalgebra sl(2N|2N) is defined by the 4N \u00d7 4N matrices\nM=\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03b8\n\u03b7 n\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere m and n are Grassmann even and \u03b8 and \u03b7 are Grassmann odd. These matrices\nare required to have vanishing supertrace3\nSTr M = \u2212Tr m + Tr n = 0 .\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe non-compact real form su(N, N|2N) is picked out by imposing the reality condition\nM = \u2212HM \u2020 H\n3\n\n(2.10)\n\nNotice that our convention is the opposite of [16], so that the supertrace is positive on the S 5\nfactor and negative on the AdS5 factor.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fwhere, in N \u00d7 N block form,\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nIN\n\u2212IN\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nH =\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nIN\nIN\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n\n(2.11)\n\nHere, \u2020 is the usual hermitian conjugation, M \u2020 = (M \u2217 )t , but with the definition that\ncomplex conjugation is anti-linear on products of Grassmann odd elements\n(\u03b81 \u03b82 )\u2217 = \u03b82\u2217 \u03b81\u2217 ,\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhich guarantees that (M1 M2 )\u2020 = M2\u2020 M1\u2020 . The superalgebra psu(N, N|2N) is then\nthe quotient of su(N, N|2N) by the unit element iI4N , which is a centre of the algebra.\nFor the cases of interest N = 1, 2, the Z4 autormorphism is defined as\nM \u2212\u2192 \u03c3\u2212 (M) = \u2212KM st K\u22121 ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere st denotes the \"super-transpose\" defined as\nM\n\nst\n\n\u0012 t\n\u0013\nm \u2212\u03b7 t\n=\n.\n\u03b8t nt\n\n(2.14)\n\nFor the case psu(2, 2|4)\n\uf8eb\n\nwhile for psu(1, 1|2)\n\n\uf8f6\n\nJ2\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nK=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nJ2\nJ2\nJ2\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f8\n\nJ2 =\n\n\u0012\n\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nK = I4 .\n\n(2.15)\n\n(2.16)\n\nUnder \u03c3\u2212 , the superalgebra psu(N, N|2N) has the decomposition\nf = f0 \u2295 f1 \u2295 f2 \u2295 f3 ,\n\n\u03c3\u2212 (fj ) = ij fj ,\n\n[fj , fk ] \u2282 fj+k mod 4 .\n\n(2.17)\n\nIn particular, the even graded parts are Grassmann even while the odd graded parts\nare Grassmann odd. The zero graded part f0 \u2261 g is the (bosonic) Lie algebra of\nG, which is the group in the denominator of the semi-symmetric space. For our\ntwo examples, G equals Sp(2, 2) \u00d7 Sp(4) and U(1) \u00d7 U(1), for N = 2 and N = 1,\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\frespectively. Correspondingly, f0 \u2295 f2 is the Lie algebra of SU(N, N) \u00d7 SU(2N),\nwhich is the bosonic subgroup of F . The fermionic parity is defined by\n\nM \u2212\u2192 PMP =\n\n\u0012\n\nm \u2212\u03b8\n\u2212\u03b7 n\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nP=\n\n\u2212I2N 0\n0 I2N\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(2.18)\n\nLike its bosonic cousin, the generalized SSSSG theory is associated to a loop\nalgebra, which in this case is the graded affine algebra\n\nf\u0302 =\n\n3\nMM\n\nz 4n+j \u2297 fj \u2261\n\nn\u2208Z j=0\n\nM\n\nf\u0302k ,\n\n(2.19)\n\nk\u2208Z\n\nwhere we have defined f\u0302k = z k \u2297 fj for k \u2212 j \u2208 4Z, and [f\u0302k , f\u0302l ] \u2282 f\u0302k+l as a consequence\nof the decomposition (2.17). It will become apparent as we proceed that the grade\nof an element is twice its Lorentz spin, where x\u00b1 are assigned spin \u22131. The Lax\nconnection, generalizing (2.4), takes the form4\n\nL+ (z) = \u2202+ + \u03b3 \u22121 \u2202+ \u03b3 + \u03b3 \u22121 A+ \u03b3 + z\u03c8+ \u2212 z 2 \u039b ,\nL\u2212 (z) = \u2202\u2212 + A\u2212 + z \u22121 \u03b3 \u22121 \u03c8\u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 z \u22122 \u03b3 \u22121 \u039b\u03b3 ,\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u2208 G, and \u03c8\u00b1 are fields taking values in f1,3 , respectively, and hence are\nfermionic. The SSSSG equations are relativistically invariant, and the form of the\nLax connection exhibits that the Lorentz transformation x\u00b1 \u2192 \u03bb\u22131 x\u00b1 is equivalent\nto the rescaling of the spectral parameter z \u2192 \u03bb2 z.\nThe theory is defined by the choice of the constant element \u039b \u2208 f2 . This in turn\n\n4\n\nOur conventions are a trivial re-labelling of those of [16], \u03c8+ = \u03a8R , \u03c8\u2212 = \u03a8L and \u039b = \u2212T . We\nalso take the mass parameter \u03bc = 1 because it can always be re-instated by dimensional analysis.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fis determined from the string world sheet theory to be [16]\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nIN\n\uf8f7\ni\uf8ec\n\u2212IN\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u039b= \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 .\n2\uf8ed\nIN\n\uf8f8\n\u2212IN\n\n5\n\n(2.22)\n\nAn important point for what follows is that the choice for \u039b is semi-simple, meaning\nthat the algebra f has a decomposition\nf = Ker(ad \u039b) \u2295 Im(ad \u039b) \u2261 f\u22a5 \u2295 fk ,\n\n(2.23)\n\nwhich lifts to the affine algebra f\u0302. In the present cases, there is the additional\nsimplifying feature that\n[f\u22a5 , f\u22a5 ] = f\u22a5 ,\n\n[f\u22a5 , fk ] = fk ,\n\n[fk , fk] = f\u22a5 ;\n\n(2.24)\n\nand so the decomposition (2.23) gives an alternative Z2 gradation of f which we\ndenote\n\u03c4 (f\u22a5 ) = f\u22a5 ,\n\n\u03c4 (fk ) = \u2212fk .\n\n(2.25)\n\n\u039bfk = \u2212fk \u039b .\n\n(2.26)\n\nIn particular, it is useful to note that\n\u039bf\u22a5 = f\u22a5 \u039b ,\n\nThe projectors onto the subspaces can be written as\nP \u22a5 = \u2212{\u039b, {\u039b, *}} ,\n\nP k = \u2212[\u039b, [\u039b, *]] .\n\n(2.27)\n\nIn a way that will be uncovered later, the affinization of the subalgebra f\u0302\u22a5 plays\nan important r\u00f4le as a symmetry algebra. In patricular the zero graded component\n5\n\nIn fact, we can think of the possible choices for \u039b in the following alternative way. If we turn\noff all the fermionic fields, then the bosonic fields are associated to the product of two ordinary\nsymmetric spaces, that is SU (2, 2)/Sp(2, 2) and SU (4)/Sp(4) for the P SU (2, 2|4) example. Then\nthe possible choices for \u039b in each of the corresponding bosonic theories are determined by the rank\nof the symmetric spaces and by their signature [2]. In the present case, SU (4)/Sp(4) = S 5 has rank\n1 and definite signature, and so there is a unique choice up to conjugation, say \u039b2 , with Tr(\u039b22 ) < 0.\nThen we have \u039b = \u03bc1 \u039b1 + \u03bc2 \u039b2 , and the Virasoro constraints require\nSTr \u039b2 = \u2212\u03bc21 Tr(\u039b21 ) + \u03bc22 Tr(\u039b22 ) = 0 .\n\n(2.21)\n\nSince SU (2, 2)/Sp(2, 2) = AdS5 has also of rank 1 but is of indefinite signature, there are two\npossible solutions. The first one is Tr(\u039b21 ) = 0 with \u03bc1 6= 0 and \u03bc2 = 0. The second is Tr(\u039b21 ) < 0\nwith \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 6= 0, which is the one considered in [16], and the one that corresponds to (2.22).\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f\u22a5\nh \u2261 f\u0302\u22a5\n0 = f0 generates an ordinary Lie group H \u2282 G. For the P SU(1, 1|2) example\nH = \u2205, while for the P SU(2, 2|4) example H = SU(2)\u00d74 which is schematically of\nthe form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n(+)\nSU(2)f\n(\u2212)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nSU(2)f\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n(2.28)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 ,\n(+)\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nSU(2)b\n(\u2212)\nSU(2)b\n\nwhere SU(2) \u2243 Sp(2). The labels on the SU(2) subgroups uniquely identify them\nand will be needed later. The group H is precisely the subgroup of G that is gauged\nin the Lagrangian formulation described below and, in (2.20), A\u00b1 \u2208 h. For the\nP SU(1, 1|2) example, notice that no gauging will be required.\n\nIn terms of the component fields, the equations-of-motion [L+ (z), L\u2212 (z)] = 0 are\n\u2202\u2212 (\u03b3 \u22121 \u2202+ \u03b3 + \u03b3 \u22121 A+ \u03b3) \u2212 \u2202+ A\u2212 + [A\u2212 , \u03b3 \u22121 \u2202+ \u03b3 + \u03b3 \u22121 A+ \u03b3]\n\u2212 [\u03c8+ , \u03b3 \u22121 \u03c8\u2212 \u03b3] \u2212 [\u039b, \u03b3 \u22121 \u039b\u03b3] = 0 ,\n\n(2.29a)\n\nD\u2213 \u03c8\u00b1 + [\u039b, \u03b3 \u22131 \u03c8\u2213 \u03b3 \u00b11 ] = 0 .\n\n(2.29b)\n\nThese equations-of-motion follow from an action of the form\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nk\nd2 x STr \u039b\u03b3 \u22121 \u039b\u03b3\nS = SgWZW [\u03b3, A\u03bc ] \u2212\n\u03c0\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nk\n2\n\u22121\n+\nd x STr \u03c8+ [\u039b, D\u2212 \u03c8+ ] \u2212 \u03c8\u2212 [\u039b, D+ \u03c8\u2212 ] \u2212 2\u03c8+ \u03b3 \u03c8\u2212 \u03b3 ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(2.30)\n\nwhere SgWZW [\u03b3, A\u03bc ] is the conventional (bosonic) gauged WZW model for G/H with\nlevel k, but involving the supertrace (2.9) rather than the ordinary trace. It is\ninvariant under the gauge transformations\n\u03b3 \u2212\u2192 U\u03b3U \u22121 ,\n\n\u0001\nA\u03bc \u2212\u2192 U A\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc U \u22121 ,\n\nU \u2208H .\n\n(2.31)\n\nAn important feature of these theories is that they admit soliton solutions whose\nfields do not fall-off at x = \u00b1\u221e, and it was emphasized in [24, 25] that this makes\nthe WZ term require careful treatment. In particular, it cannot strictly speaking\nbe defined as an integral over a three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional\nspacetime as a boundary. One way to unambiguously define the action is, as in [21],\nto use the condition of gauge invariance to pin down the expansion of the WZ term\nin terms of \u03c6, with \u03b3 = e\u03c6 . This prescription requires to supplement the action with\na boundary term\nZ\n\u0001\nk\n\u2212\nd2 x \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc Tr A\u03bd \u03c6 ,\n(2.32)\n2\u03c0\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fwhich does not contribute to the equations of motion. The gauge transformations of\nthe fermionic variables read as follows\n\u03c8\u00b1 \u2212\u2192 U\u03c8\u00b1 U \u22121 .\n\n(2.33)\n\nMoreover, in the action above it is assumed that the fermionic fields satisfy the\nconstraints\n\u22a5\n\u03c8\u00b1\n=0,\n\n(2.34)\n\nNotice that these conditions are consistent with the equations-of-motion (2.29b), and\nit turns out that they arise very naturally in the string theory setting as fixing the\nresidual \u03ba-symmetry of the world-sheet theory [16].\nThe equations-of-motion of the gauge field imply the vanishing of the (na\u0131\u0308ve)\ngauge current on-shell6\n\u0011\u22a5\n\u0010\n\u22131\n\u00b11\n\u22131\n\u00b11\nJ\u00b1 = \u00b1 \u03b3 \u2202\u00b1 \u03b3 + \u03b3 A\u00b1 \u03b3\n\u2213 A\u00b1 \u00b1 2\u039b\u03c8\u00b1 \u03c8\u00b1 \u2248 0 .\n\n(2.35)\n\nThe equations (2.29a) projected onto f\u0302\u22a5 , together with (2.35), imply the flatness\ncondition\n[\u2202+ + A+ , \u2202\u2212 + A\u2212 ] \u2248 0 ,\n\n(2.36)\n\nand so one can fix the gauge-at least on-shell-by taking A\u03bc = 0, and from (2.35)\nwe have the constraints\n\u03b3 \u22131 \u2202\u00b1 \u03b3 \u00b11\n\n\u0001\u22a5\n\n+ 2\u039b\u03c8\u00b1 \u03c8\u00b1 = 0 .\n\n(2.37)\n\nA convenient gauge to choose off-shell is a kind of light-cone gauge which imposes\nthe Lorentz invariance condition A+ = 0 [20, 21, 23]. Anyway, for the solutions to\nthe equations-of-motion, we will always be able to take A\u03bc = 0. Note that all the\ncomplications of the gauge fields are absent in the simpler P SU(1, 1|2) case where\nH is trivial.\nAlthough the gauge current in (2.35) vanishes, we expect that physical configurations will carry charge under the global subgroup of the gauge group. This seems\nparadoxical, but actually it is typical of a gauge theory and it is well known that\nthe charge charge does not come from integrating the na\u0131\u0308ve temporal component of\nthe gauge current. In fact, as we have seen above, this current vanishes on-shell.\n6\n\nWhere necessary, the notation \u2248 will indicate equality on-shell.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fRather the physical current receives a \"topological\" contribution that is fixed by the\nboundary term (2.32). Writing \u03b3 = e\u03c6 , the true Noether current is [24, 25]\nJ \u03bc = J \u03bc + \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03c6\u22a5 ,\n\n(2.38)\n\nwhich is sensitive to the behaviour of the field at spatial infinity. On-shell, the charge\nis then equal to a kink charge\nZ\nZ\n0\nQ = dx J \u2248 \u2212 dx \u22021 \u03c6\u22a5 = \u2212\u03c6\u22a5 (\u221e) + \u03c6\u22a5 (\u2212\u221e) = q0 .\n(2.39)\nNote that at x = \u00b1\u221e the group field must lie in a minimum of the potential so that\n\u03c6(\u00b1\u221e) \u2208 h and consequently the projection onto h = g\u22a5 is unnecessary. Assuming\nthat \u03b3(\u00b1\u221e) commute, which will be true for the configurations that we consider, it\nfollows that the kink charge corresponds precisely to\n\u03b3(\u221e)\u22121 \u03b3(\u2212\u221e) = eq0 .\n\n(2.40)\n\n3. The Integrable System\nUnderlying the SSSSG theories there is a new kind of integrable system which is\nbased on the graded affine algebra f\u0302. The system leads to a set of what are generally\nunderstood as hidden symmetries of the SSSSG theory generated by the elements\nof the subalgebra f\u0302\u22a5 . An important part of our story is that these symmetries\ninclude a finite subalgebra which has the form of an extended supersymmetry algebra,\nand which they are conventional Noether symmetries associated to local conserved\ncurrents.\nThe Lax equations (2.3) are the integrability conditions for the associated linear\nproblem\nL\u03bc (z)\u03a5(z) = 0 .\n\n(3.1)\n\nIt follows that the \"subtracted monodromy\" [24]\nM(z) = lim \u03a50 (x; z)\u22121 \u03a5(x; z)\u03a5\u22121 (\u2212x; z)\u03a50 (\u2212x; z) ,\nx\u2192\u221e\n\n(3.2)\n\nis constant in time, where the subtraction involves removing the effects of\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03a50 (x; z) = exp (z 2 x+ + z \u22122 x\u2212 )\u039b ,\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fwhich is the vacuum solution of the linear problem (\u03b3 = 1, \u03c8\u00b1 = 0, A\u03bc = 0). Note\nthat individually the quantities \u03a5(x; z) and \u03a50 (x; z) diverge as x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, but the\nsubtracted monodromy is a finite quantity.\nThe expansion of the subtracted monodromy around z = 0 and \u221e provide an\nset of conserved charges qs ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nM(z) = exp q0 + q1 z + q2 z 2 + * * * = exp q\u22121 /z + q\u22122 /z 2 + * * * ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nof Lorentz spin 2s , and we will soon show that qs \u2208 f\u22a5 . Generally, these charges\nare non-local quantities, however, some of them are associated to local conserved\ncurrents. This includes the spin \u00b1 12 charges q\u00b11 as well as the components of qs\nalong the centre of f\u22a5 , which includes the infinite set of elements z 2+4n \u039b with n \u2208 Z.\nIn particular, the conserved 2-momentum of a configuration is given by\np\u00b1 = \u2213\n\n\u0001\nk\nSTr \u039bq\u22132 .\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe form of the conserved currents can be deduced using the Drinfeld-Sokolov\nprocedure [32]. In the following, we will impose the on-shell gauge A\u03bc = 0 and start\nby considering the currents of positive spin. To this end, we introduce\nX\n\u03a6(z) = exp y(z) ,\ny(z) =\ny\u2212s z \u2212s \u2208 f\u0302<0\n(3.6)\ns\u22651\n\nand solve (off-shell, up to the choice of gauge fixing conditions)\nX\n\u03a6(z)\u22121 L+ (z)\u03a6(z) = \u2202+ \u2212 z 2 \u039b + h+ (z) ,\nh+ (z) =\nhs,+ z s \u2208 f\u0302\u22a5\n\u22641 ,\n\n(3.7)\n\ns\u22641\n\nwhich can be done order-by-order in z as we illustrate below. Correspondingly,\n\u03a6(z)\u22121 L\u2212 (z)\u03a6(z) = \u2202\u2212 + h\u2212 (z) ,\n\nh\u2212 (z) \u2208 f\u0302\u2264\u22121 .\n\n(3.8)\n\nThen, the zero curvature condition (2.3) becomes (on-shell)\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\u2202+ \u2212 z 2 \u039b + h+ (z), \u2202\u2212 + h\u2212 (z) = 0 \u21d2 h\u2212 (z) \u2208 f\u0302\u22a5\n\u2264\u22121 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhich implies, in particular, that\n\n\u2202\u2212 h1,+ = 0 ,\n\n\u2202\u2212 h0,+ = [h1,+ , h\u22121,\u2212 ] .\n\n(3.10)\n\nThis shows that we can consistently set\nh1,+ = h0,+ = 0 \u21d2 h+ (z) \u2208 f\u0302\u22a5\n\u2264\u22121 .\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fThis type of constraints are well known in the context of integrable hierarchies [33\u2013\n35]. Below, we will show that they are equivalent to (2.34) and (2.37). In addition,\nthe zero-curvature condition (3.9) implies that the components of h\u00b1 (z) in the centre\nof f\u0302\u22a5 lead directly to conserved currents.\nIn [34], it was emphasized that the choice of \u03a6 is not unique. It is defined modulo\nthe transformations \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6\u03b7 with\n\u03b7 \u2208 exp f\u0302\u22a5\n<0 ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhich do not change the form of (3.7)-but do change the value of h\u00b1 (z). However,\nthe solution can always be chosen such that \u03a6 and h\u00b1 (z) are local functions of the\ncomponent fields by simply enforcing the condition\nk\n\n(3.13)\n\ny(z) \u2208 f\u0302<0 ,\n\nwhich will be used in the following. This can be proved by induction as will become\nclear as we show the beginning of this process below.

In fact, this hierarchy is an example of the generalized Drinfel'd-Sokolov hierarchies constructed in refs. [32, 36].8 Usually, when\ndiscussing an integrable hierarchy one is interested in the infinite set of flows which\nmutually commute. However, in the present context we are interested in flows which\nonly commute with the spacetime flows \u2202\u00b1 but not necessarily amongst themselves.\nIn fact, one can associate a \"flow\" to each element of f\u0302\u22a5 [35, 37, 38], but only those\nassociated to the (bosonic) centre of f\u0302\u22a5 will commute among themselves. These\nnon-abelian flows act as hidden non-abelian symmetries of the equations-of-motion\nof the SSSSG theory that are not generally manifested as Noether symmetries of the\naction, although an important part of our argument is that a finite subset of them\nare. The structure of these additional flows can be simply deduced by noticing that\nthe Lax operators of the basic spacetime flows can be written in two distinct ways\n(3.30) and (3.32),\n\u0001\n\u0001\nL\u00b1 = \u03c7 \u2202\u00b1 \u2212 z \u00b12 \u039b \u03c7\u22121 = \u03b3 \u22121 L\u0303\u00b1 \u03b3 = \u03b3 \u22121 \u03c7\u0303 \u2202\u00b1 \u2212 z \u00b12 \u039b \u03c7\u0303\u22121 \u03b3\n\n(3.40)\n\n\u0001\nLb = \u03b4b \u2212 qb \u2212 b = \u03c7 \u03b4b \u2212 b)\u03c7\u22121 = \u03b3 \u22121 \u03c7\u0303 \u03b4b \u2212 b \u03c7\u0303\u22121 \u03b3 .\n\n(3.41)\n\n[L\u03bc , Lb] = 0\n\n(3.42)\n\n\u03b4b L\u03bc = [qb + b, L\u03bc ]\n\n(3.43)\n\nwith \u03c7 \u2208 exp f\u0302<0 and \u03c7\u0303 \u2208 exp f\u0302>0 . Writing the basic \"spacetime flow\" Lax operators\nin these two ways is key as we shall see. It follows that one can construct flows which\nmanifestly commute with them by taking any constant element b \u2208 f\u02c6\u22a5 and defining\na Lax operator\n\nIf b has grade n, then it follows from the two ways of writing Lb that qb has grades\nbetween 0 and n \u2212 1, for n > 0, and between \u2212|n| and \u22121, for n < 0. Clearly,\n\nand we can think of\n\nas a set of symmetry variations of the original equations that are preserved under\neither x+ or x\u2212 evolution. The consistency of (3.43) requires that the right-hand\nside has grades (0, 1), for L+ , and (\u22122, \u22121), for L\u2212 , and this follows simply from the\n8\n\nIn the following, we will only need the general construction of [32, 36] with a single gradation\nrather than the more general possibility involving a pair of gradations. This identifies the hierarchy\nas being of mKdV type. Moreover, in those references the hierarchies were classified as Type I or II\naccording to whether f\u0302\u22a5 is abelian or not. For present purposes, f\u0302\u22a5 is non-abelian in general and,\nthus, the hierarcies will be generically of Type II.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\ftwo ways of writing qb implicit in (3.41). In this construction, the spacetime flows \u2202\u00b1\ncoincide with the flows associated to b = z \u00b12 \u039b. Moreover, for n = 0 we have qb = 0\nand \u03b4b corresponds just to an infinitesimal global gauge transformation.\nIt is important to notice that, as a direct consequence of (3.41), the symmetry\nvariations form a non-abelian algebra which is simply isomorphic to f\u0302\u22a5 :\n[\u03b4b , \u03b4b\u2032 ] = \u03b4[b,b\u2032 ] .\n\n(3.44)\n\nSupersymmetry\nWe will be particularly interested in the symmetry variations generated by the\nGrassmann odd elements b = z \u00b11 \u03b5\u00b1 \u2208 f\u0302\u00b11 . We will argue that these variations are\nthe odd elements of an extended SUSY algebra which are Noether symmetries of the\nSSSSG theory. The supersymmetry algebra corresponds to a finite subalgebra s \u2282 f\u0302\u22a5\ngenerated by the elements of f\u0302\u22a5 of grade 0 and \u00b11 along with two central elements\nof grade \u00b12.\nTo be precise, notice that the superalgebra f\u22a5 \u2282 psu(N, N|2N) splits into two\nmutually commuting subalgebras f\u22a5(\u00b1) whose elements are of form\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\nm(+)\n0\n\u2212\u03b1(+)\u2020 0\n\uf8ec 0\nm(\u2212)\n0\n\u03b1(\u2212) \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nM = \uf8ec (+)\n\uf8f7,\n(+)\n\uf8ed\u03b1\n0\nn\n0 \uf8f8\n0\nn(\u2212)\n0 +\u03b1(\u2212) \u2020\n\n(3.45)\n\nwith\nm(\u00b1) \u2020 = \u2212m(\u00b1) ,\n\nn(\u00b1) \u2020 = \u2212n(\u00b1) ,\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nTr m(+) + m(\u2212) = Tr n(+) + n(\u2212) , (3.46)\n\nwhere all the entries are N \u00d7 N matrices. For N = 1, 2, it is easy to check that\n\u22a5(\u00b1) \u22a5(\u00b1)\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\n[f1 , f1 ] is a subset of f2\nthat includes only the identity element of f\u22a5(+) and\nf\u22a5(\u2212) , respectively; namely,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nIN\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec I\n\uf8f7\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec N\n\uf8f7\nI(+) = \uf8ec\nI(\u2212) = \uf8ec\n(3.47)\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f7 .\nIN \uf8f8\n0\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0\nIN\nHowever, in psu(N, N|2N) one identifies elements differing by a multiple of the\nidentity matrix and, thus, I(\u00b1) \u223c \u2213i\u039b. Therefore, in psu(1, 1|2) and psu(2, 2|4),\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\f\u22a5(\u00b1)\n\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\n\n[f1 , f1\nhave\n\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\n\n(\u00b1)\n] is actually a subset of f\u22a5\n, \u03b7 (\u00b1) \u2208 f1\n2 generated by \u039b, and for \u01eb\n\n[\u01eb(\u00b1) , \u03b7 (\u00b1) ] = \u2212\n\n\u0001\n2\nTr \u039b\u01eb(\u00b1) \u03b7 (\u00b1) \u039b ,\nN\n\nwe\n\n(3.48)\n\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\n\nand a similar equation for \u01eb(\u00b1) , \u03b7 (\u00b1) \u2208 f\u22121 . In addition, one can check that the\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\nsubalgebra of f\u22a5 generated by the (odd) generators in f\u00b11 is just the \"derived\"\nalgebra of f\u22a5 ,\n[f\u22a5 , f\u22a5 ] \u2282 f\u22a5 ,\n\n(3.49)\n\nwhose elements are of the form (3.45) constrained by the additional conditions\nTr m(\u00b1) ) = Tr n(\u00b1) ) .\n\n(3.50)\n\nAll this shows that, for N = 1, 2, the subalgebra [f\u22a5 , f\u22a5 ] is just\n\u0001\np su(N|N) \u2295 su(N|N) ,\n\n(3.51)\n\nwhere each of the su(N|N) factors is associated to the two mutually commuting\nsubalgebras f\u22a5(\u00b1) , and \u039b provides a non-trivial center.\nRemarkably, in the affine algebra f\u0302 defined in (2.19), [f\u22a5 , f\u22a5 ] gives rise to a finite\nsubalgebra s whose generators are9\n\b\n\b \u22122\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\n\u2295 z2\u039b .\nz \u039b \u2295 z \u22121 f\u22121 \u2295 z 0 h(\u00b1) \u2295 z 1 f1\n\n(3.52)\n\nThis is a closed algebra because of (2.24) and, crucially, because of (3.48) that is\nonly satisfied for N = 1, 2. Since the two generators z \u00b12 \u039b give rise to the spacetime\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\nflows \u2202\u00b1 , then the symmetry variations (3.43) associated to z \u22121 f\u22121 and z +1 f+1\nare actually SUSY transformations that, using (3.44) and (3.48), satisfy\n\u0001\n\u0003\n2\n\u03b4z +1 \u01eb(\u00b1) , \u03b4z +1\u03b7(\u00b1) = \u2212 Tr \u039b\u01eb(\u00b1) \u03b7 (\u00b1) \u2202+ ,\nN\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n\u03b4z \u22121 \u01eb\u0303(\u00b1) , \u03b4z \u22121 \u03b7\u0303(\u00b1) = \u2212 Tr \u039b\u01eb\u0303(\u00b1) \u03b7\u0303 (\u00b1) \u2202\u2212 ,\nN\n\n\u0002\n\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\n\n\u01eb(\u00b1) , \u03b7 (\u00b1) \u2208 f+1 ,\n(3.53)\n(\u00b1)\n\n\u01eb\u0303\n\n, \u03b7\u0303\n\n(\u00b1)\n\n\u2208\n\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\nf\u22121\n\n.\n\nMoreover, the comparison between s and the form or [f\u22a5 , f\u22a5 ] given by (3.51) shows\nthat the SUSY algebra s is actually isomorphic to the double central extension\n\n9\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\npsu(N|N) \u2295 psu(N|N) \u22c9 R \u2295 R ,\n\n(3.54)\n\nThe algebra also includes the Lorentz boost generator which corresponds to the derivation of\nthe affine algebra zd/dz. We shall leave this implicit in the following.\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fwhere the two generators of the central extension R \u2295 R correspond to z \u22122 \u039b and\nz +2 \u039b or, equivalently, to the spacetime flows \u2202\u00b1 .\nNow we consider more details of the 2 cases N = 1, 2 separately.\n(i) For the more complicated psu(2, 2|4) case, the complete extended SUSY\nalgebra is psu(2|2) \u2295 psu(2|2) with two central extensions,\n\u0001\n\u0001\ns = psu(2|2) \u2295 psu(2|2) \u22c9 R \u2295 R\n\n(3.55)\n\nS = P SU(2|2)\u00d72 \u22c9 R\u00d72 .\n\n(3.56)\n\nand the corresponding supergroup is\n\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\n\nEach psu(2|2) factor provides 4 SUSY generators of each chirality (4 in z 1 \u2297 f+1\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\nand 4 in z \u22121 \u2297 f\u22121 ). Therefore, there are 8 independent real supersymmetries\nin each P SU(2|2) factor and so the SUSY is an exotic example of N = (8, 8).\nMoreover, the bosonic subgroup includes the group of global gauge transformations\nH = SU(2)\u00d74 . The novel thing is that H plays the r\u00f4le of what appears to be a nonabelian R-symmetry group, with the supercharges transforming under H and the\nphysical bosonic and fermionic degrees-of-freedom come in different representations\nk\nk\nk\nof this group; that is f2 = (2, 2, 1, 1) + (1, 1, 2, 2), for the bosons, and f1 + f3 =\n(2, 1, 1, 2) + (1, 2, 2, 1) for the fermions.\n(ii) For the case psu(1, 1|2) the situation is much simpler. The (bosonic) 0-graded\nsubalgebras h(\u00b1) are absent, so there is no R symmetry group, and s takes the form of\na conventional supersymmetry algebra with 2 independent real supersymmetries. In\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\n\u22a5(\u00b1)\nparticular, the generators in z \u22121 f\u22121 commute with those in zf+1 . This dovetails\nnicely with the fact that the physical fields are abelian. The number of independent\nSUSYs is N = (2, 2).\nIt is important to note that if we try to generalize the theories to arbitrary\npsu(N, N|2N) then the algebra generated by the Grassmann elements f\u22a5\n\u00b11 does not\n\u22a5\nclose onto a finite subalgebra of f\u0302 . Therefore, the resulting theories will not have a\nconventional supersymmetry.\nThe variations of the fields can be found by expanding out (3.43) and solving for\nthe variations self consistently. For b = z\u03b5+ , one finds\n\u03b3 \u22121 \u03b4\u03b3 = \u22122\u039b[\u03b5+ , \u03c8+ ] \u2212 q \u22a5 ,\n\u03b4\u03c8+ = [\u03b5+ , (\u03b3 \u22121 \u2202+ \u03b3)k ] + [q \u22a5 , \u03c8+ ] ,\n\u03b4\u03c8\u2212 = 2\u039b(\u03b3\u03b5+ \u03b3 \u22121 )k .\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n(3.57)\n\n\fIn the above, q \u22a5 can be thought of as a compensating gauge transformation that is\nneeded to preserve the gauge constraints (2.37). This term is non-local in the fields\nand is found by integrating\n(+)\n\n\u2202\u2212 q \u22a5 = [\u03b5+ , (\u03b3 \u22121 \u03c8\u2212 \u03b3)\u22a5 ] = [\u03b5+ , G\u2212 ]\n\n(3.58)\n\nThis complicating factor is not present in the simpler psu(1, 1|2) theories. It is\nimportant that these variations preserve the gauge conditions (2.37) and the kappa\nsymmetry conditions (2.34). There is a similar set of variations associated to z \u22121 \u03b5\u2212\nthat can be found by making the substitutions (3.26).\nThe supersymmetry transformations have been constructed on-shell, so are symmetries of the equations-of-motion in the on-shell gauge A\u03bc = 0. However, in the\nAppendix we show that these symmetries extend off-shell to symmetries of the action. For the psu(2, 2|4) theory the non-trivial aspect of these transformations is\nthat they involve the non-local gauge transformation q \u22a5 which explains why they\nare not obvious symmetries of the action. Ultimately it seems likely that this nonlocal nature of the transformations could be responsible in the quantum theory for a q\ndeformation of the supersymmetry algebra s. For the simpler psu(1, 1|2) theories, the\nsupersymmetry has been identified in [16,18] as conventional N = 2 supersymmetry.\n\n4. The Perturbative Spectrum\nIn this section we establish the spectrum of perturbative fluctuations. Taking A\u03bc = 0,\nthe linearized equations-of-motion for fluctuations \u03c6 where\n\u03b3 = e\u03c6 \u2243 1 + \u03c6 + * * *\n\n(4.1)\n\nis simply the free wave equation\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0003\u03c6 = \u220202 \u2212 \u220212 )\u03c6 = 4 \u039b, [\u039b, \u03c6] .\n\n(4.2)\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c6\u22a5 + \u03c6k\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe on-shell gauge conditions (2.37) have the effect of removing the massless modes\n\u03c6\u22a5 \u2208 h. In order to see this, expand\n\nand solve the constraints (2.37) for \u03c6\u22a5 order-by-order in the fluctuation \u03c6k . To lowest\norder\n1\n\u2202\u00b1 \u03c6\u22a5 = \u00b1 [\u03c6k , \u2202\u00b1 \u03c6k ] \u2213 2\u039b\u03c8\u00b1 \u03c8\u00b1 + * * * .\n2\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fk\n\nIn the above, \u03c8\u00b1 \u2261 \u03c8\u00b1 due to the constraint (2.34). Hence, to linear order \u03c6\u22a5 = 0,\nhowever, it is interesting that to quadratic order \u03c6\u22a5 becomes non-vanishing. Pursuing\nthis further we find that \u03c6\u22a5 actually has a kink-like behaviour; to quadratic order\n\u03c6\u22a5 (x = \u221e) \u2212 \u03c6\u22a5 (x = \u2212\u221e)\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u00101\n\u0001\u0011\n\u22a5\n=\ndx \u22021 \u03c6 =\ndx [\u03c6k , \u22020 \u03c6k ] + 2\u039b \u03c8+ \u03c8+ + \u03c8\u2212 \u03c8\u2212 .\n2\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(4.5)\n\nRemarkably, the right-hand side is the H charge of a perturbative mode. In order to\nsee this, note that the tree-level action for the perturbative modes is\nk\nS=\u2212\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd2 x Tr\n\n\u00101\n\n1\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6k \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6k \u2212 [\u039b, \u03c6k]2\n8\n2\n\n+ \u039b\u03c8+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c8+ \u2212 \u039b\u03c8\u2212 \u2202+ \u03c8\u2212 + \u03c8+ \u03c8\u2212 + * * *\n\n\u0011\n\n(4.6)\n,\n\nwhich is invariant under adjoint action under the unbroken global part of the gauge\nsymmetry:\n\u03c6k \u2212\u2192 U\u03c6k U \u22121 ,\n\n\u03c8\u00b1 \u2192 U\u03c8\u00b1 U \u22121 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe associated Noether current takes the form\n1\nJ\u00b1 = \u00b1 [\u03c6k , \u2202\u00b1 \u03c6k ] \u00b1 2\u039b\u03c8\u00b1 \u03c8\u00b1 .\n2\n\n(4.8)\n\nConsequently, as anticipated in (2.39) and (2.40), the Noether charge is equal to the\nkink charge\nQ=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndx J 0 = \u2212\u03c6(\u221e) + \u03c6(\u221e) \u2261 q0 .\n\n(4.9)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIn fact the H symmetry of the free action for the perturbative modes is actually part of a larger invariance under the extended supersymmetry algebra s whose\nvariations follow by expanding (3.57) to linear order:\n\u03b4\u03c6k = \u22122\u039b[\u03b5+ , \u03c8+ ] ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c8+ = [\u03b5+ , \u2202+ \u03c6k ] ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c8\u2212 = 2\u039b[\u03c6k , \u03b5+ ] .\n\n(4.10)\n\nWe can now go on to quantize the perturbative modes at tree level and this will\nlead to a quantization of the kink charge. The perturbative states naturally fall into\nthe fundamental representation of the supergroup S, that is the (2|2)-dimensional\nrepresentation for each of the SU(2|2) factors, for the psu(2, 2|4) case.\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\f5. The Solitons\nIn this section we construct soliton solutions. The discussion will mostly be aimed to\nthe more involved AdS5 \u00d7S 5 case, but can easily be adapted to the simpler AdS2 \u00d7S 1\ncase. The idea will be to generalize the dressing method used in the bosonic theories\nand described in detail in [24]. The soliton solutions will be solutions of the equationsof-motion with A\u03bc = 0, and which automatically satisfy the gauge constraint (2.37)\nand the kappa symmetry conditions (2.34).\nThe dressing method focuses on the solution of the linear system (3.1). The\nquantity \u03a5(z) is an element of the loop group associated to f\u0302 and so it must satisfy\nthe reality condition (2.10) lifted to the loop group\n\u2020\n\nH\u03a5(z \u2217 )\u22121 H = \u03a5(z) .\n\n(5.1)\n\nSimilarly it must have the appropriate behaviour under the automorphism\nst\n\nK\u22121 \u03a5(z)\u22121 K = \u03a5(iz) .\n\n(5.2)\n\nIt is also useful to have the action of fermionic parity\n(5.3)\n\nP\u03a5(z)P = \u03a5(\u2212z) .\n\nSoliton solutions are special solutions for which g+ = g\u2212 = 1 in the RiemannHilbert problem (3.35) [39]. Then, (3.31) and (3.34) imply that the solution of the\nlinear problem can be written in two equivalent ways\n\u03a5(x; z) = \u03c7(x; z)\u03a50 (x; z) = \u03b3 \u22121 \u03c7\u0303(x; z)\u03a50 (x; z) .\n\n(5.4)\n\nIn the context of solitons, \u03c7(z) \u2261 \u03c7(x; z) is known as the \"dressing transformation\"\nfor the obvious reason that it generates the soliton solutions from the vacuum. The\nmethod then proceeds by taking an ansatz for the dressing factor which takes the\nform of a sum over a finite set of simple poles\n\u03c7(z) = 1 +\n\nQi\n,\nz \u2212 \u03bei\n\n\u03c7(z)\u22121 = 1 +\n\nRi\n.\nz \u2212 \u03bci\n\n(5.5)\n\nThen, the associated linear problem (3.1) (in the gauge A\u00b1 = 0) gives rise to the two\nequations:\n\u2202+ \u03c7(z)\u03c7(z)\u22121 + z 2 \u03c7(z)\u039b\u03c7(z)\u22121 = \u2212\u03b3 \u22121 \u2202+ \u03b3 \u2212 z\u03c8+ + z 2 \u039b ,\n\n(5.6a)\n\n\u2202\u2212 \u03c7(z)\u03c7(z)\u22121 + z \u22122 \u03c7(z)\u039b\u03c7(z)\u22121 = \u2212z \u22121 \u03b3 \u22121 \u03c8\u2212 \u03b3 + z \u22122 \u03b3 \u22121 \u039b\u03b3 .\n\n(5.6b)\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fThe fields can be extracted from the expansions of \u03c7(z) around z = 0 and z = \u221e:\n\u0001\n2\n+ O(z \u22123 )\n\u03c7(z) = 1 + z \u22121 W\u22121 + z \u22122 W\u22122 + 21 W\u22121\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(5.7)\n\u0001\n2\n3\n2\n\u22121\n1\n1 + zW1 + z W2 + 2 W1 + O(z ) .\n=\u03b3\n\nHence, as well as\n\n\u03b3 = \u03c7(0)\u22121 ,\n\n(5.8)\n\n\u03c8\u00b1 = [W\u22131 , \u039b] ,\n\n(5.9)\n\nwe have\n\nwhich is the kappa symmetry fixing condition (2.34).

These are\nprecisely the on-shell gauge constraints (2.37).\nNow, since the dependence on z of the right-hand-side of (5.6b) is explicit, the\nresidues of the left-hand-side at z = \u03bei and \u03bci must vanish, giving\n\u0001\u0010\nRj \u0011\n\u22132\n\u03bei \u2202\u00b1 Qi + Qi \u039b 1 +\n=0,\n\u03be i \u2212 \u03bcj\n(5.11)\n\u0010\n\u0001\nQj \u0011\n1+\n\u2212\u03bc\u22132\ni \u2202\u00b1 Ri + \u039bRi = 0 .\n\u03bci \u2212 \u03be j\nThe key to solving them is to propose that the residues have rank one [24, 40]:\nQi = X i F \u2020i\n\nand Ri = H i K \u2020i ,\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhere 8-vectors are written in boldface. However, at this point we have to make a\nchoice. The point is that in order to preserve the fermionic grading, the vectors must\nhave the structure\n!\nv1\n(5.13)\nv=\nv2\nwhere either of the 4-vectors v 1 , or v 2 , must be Grassmann odd. This ensures that\na matrix of the form vw \u2020 is valued in gl(4|4). We shall fix the choice by realizing\nthat there is a known consistent bosonic soliton solution for the S 5 = SU(4)/Sp(4)\nfactor. This solution would be obtained by taking a dressing ansatz where all the\nvectors have v 1 = 0. In other words, the sub 4-vector v 1 must be Grassmann odd\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fand the sub 4-vector v 2 must be Grassmann even. The other possible solutions with\nv 1 Grassmann even should be in the domain of spiky strings configurations, which\nare soliton-like solutions with singularities at the spikes.\nNotice that the fermionic parity operator P has the correct action on these\nvectors which we call (4|4) vectors.

Consequently, since sin q > 0, in the asymptotic regimes x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e we can effectively\nreplace \u031f by v \u00b1 , respectively. Since the solution is invariant under the complex\nre-scalings \u031f \u2192 \u03bb\u031f this means that it becomes independent of x and t in the\nasymptotic regimes which is consistent with it being a localized soliton.\nThe freedom in the vectors v \u00b1 implies that the kink carries internal collective\ncoordinates. In order to understand their significance, consider the action of the\nSUSY group S on the solution. This can be obtained by considering an S variation\nof the vacuum solution and then by dressing this in the standard way to construct\nthe transformed soliton. The transformation of the vacuum under a symmetry b \u2208 s\nis simply given by\n\u0001\n(5.36)\n\u03b4b \u2212 b \u03a50 (z) = 0 ,\nb\u2208s\n\nand so the transformed vacuum solution is in the orbit of the supergroup (3.56)\nacting in the rest frame of the soliton which we denote S0 . In the rest frame, the\ncentral extensions are equal, i.e. z = 1 in (3.52), and so\n\u0001\n(5.37)\nS0 = P SU(2|2)\u00d72 .\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fTherefore the orbit is of the form\n\u03a50 (x; z) \u2212\u2192 \u03a50 (x; z)U ,\n\n(5.38)\n\nwhere U is a constant (x\u00b1 independent) element of S0 . Notice that U includes SUSY\ntransformations and global gauge transformations. When the transformed vacuum\nis dressed, it gives rise to a soliton solution with a transformation of \u031f:\n\u031f \u2212\u2192 U\u031f .\n\n(5.39)\n\nThis freedom, along with scaling symmetries and spacetime translations, can be used\nto set\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n0\n0\n\u03a9\u00b1 =\n,\nu\u00b1 =\n.\n(5.40)\n1\n0\nwhich is the bosonic kink solution with the fermionic fields vanishing. Hence, just as\nin the SSSG theories, the kinks have an internal moduli space that can be thought of\nas a (co-)adjoint orbit, but in this case of the supergroup S0 .

Semi-Classical Quantization\nIn the remainder of the paper, we proceed to a semi-classical quantization of the\nsoliton in the standard way. Namely; one allows the collective coordinates to become\ntime-dependent X \u2192 X(t) and then substitutes the solution back into the action.\nIntegrating over the spatial domain gives an effective action for the collective coordinate functions Seff [X(t)]. This one-dimensional field theory, which can be viewed\nas existing along the world line of the soliton, can then be quantized leading to\nquantum mechanics on the moduli space M. To lowest order in the semi-classical\n10\n\nRecall that we set the overall mass scale to \u03bc = 1.\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\flimit one keeps the terms with the smallest number of t-derivatives. In usual soliton\ntheories these terms are quadratic in \u1e8a. However, as was shown in [24, 25], for the\nSSSG theories the dominant terms are actually linear in \u1e8a, and on quantization this\nleads to a non-commutative version of the moduli space. The new element in the\npresent setting are the Grassmann odd coordinates: M is a superspace. Since the\nfermionic kinetic terms are linear in t derivatives we suspect that the effective action\nof the Grassmann odd coordinates is also linear in their t-derivatives. This means\nthat SUSY has a interesting realization on the effective quantum mechanics on the\nmoduli space: it is a global symmetry of a supergroup rather than a local symmetry\nalong the world line.\nIn this regard, the Grassmann even and odd collective coordinates will be treated\nsomewhat differently. For fixed charge q, the bosonic soliton solution, with all the\nGrassmann coordinates set to zero, is a bona-fide semi-classical object that consists\nof a large number of quantum excitations. In fact, it was found in [24] that this\npicture can be made very concrete: the semi-classical soliton states are coherent\nstates of high excitation number of order k. In contrast, for the Grassmann odd\nsector these kind of semi-classical states do not exist, and because of Fermi statistics\nthere are only a small number of states with low occupation number. Consequently,\nthe Grassmann odd exictations are inherently quantum. Although we have the full\nclassical solution to all orders in the Grassmann odd coordinates, in the quantum\ntheory the interpretation of this general solution with the Grassmann odd modes\nturned on is potentially beset by operator ordering ambiguities. Consequently, we\nwill work to lowest order in the Grassmann odd coordinates as this will be enough\nto see the supersymmetry of the quantum mechanical system.\nFirst of all, we consider the bosonic solution with all the Grassmann odd coordinates turned off u\u00b1 = 0. In this case, following the discussion in [24, 25], the\nmoduli space in the Grassmann even directions takes the form of a co-adjoint orbit\n\u2212\nof the subgroup Hb = SU(2)+\nb \u00d7 SU(2)b \u2282 H.

In\nthis case, the relevant terms in the Lagrangian (2.6) are the fermion kinetic terms.\nWorking to lowest order in the semi-classical expansion, the fermionic fields are,\nas expected, linear the Grassmann collective coordinates and the fermion kinetic\n11\n\nNotice that the quotient by U (1) is trivial at the level of the Hilbert space.\n\n\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n\fterms are consequently quadratic in the coordinates. By brute force computation\nthe effective quantum mechanical action for the Grassmann collective coordinates is\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nk\nd2 x STr \u2212\u039b\u03c8+ \u03c8\u0307+ + \u039b\u03c8\u2212 \u03c8\u0307\u2212\nSeff =\n\u03c0\nZ\n(6.13)\n\u0001\n2k sin q\n\u2217\n\u2217\n=\ndt u\u0307+ * u+ \u2212 u\u0307\u2212 * u\u2212 .\n\u03c0\n\nOnce again we concentrate on the + sector and drop the label. Upon quantization,\nthe Grassmann coordinates simply satisfy a set of anti-commutation relations:\n\b\n\u03c0\n\u03b4ij .\n\u00fbi , \u00fb\u2020j =\n(6.14)\n2k sin q\n\nA Fock space can then be built by taking the u\u2020i as creation operators and ui as\nannihilation operators. There are 4 states in the Fock space\n|0i ,\n\n\u00fb\u20201 |0i ,\n\n\u00fb\u20202 |0i ,\n\n\u00fb\u20201 \u00fb\u20202 |0i .\n\n(6.15)\n\nNow once we turn on the Grassmann coordinates, the bosonic part of the soliton\nsolution is modified even at the classical level. As we have described at the start of\nthis section, we will consider the effects of this back-reaction to leading order because\nthis will suffice to motivate the supersymmetry structure of the effective theory. The\nleading order effect of back reaction is the fact that the Grassmann odd modes carry\nkink, or Hb , charge. For example, we saw this at the perturbative level in (4.8). We\ncan extract the back-reaction on q0 from the full soliton solution keeping terms to\nlinear order in the bi-linear operator u\u2020 * u. The effect is very simple and amounts\nto a shift\nq \u2192 q \u2032 = q \u2212 sin q \u00fb\u2020 * \u00fb = q \u2212\n\n\u03c0\nN\u0302f\n2k\n\n(6.16)\n\nin (6.4), where Nf is the fermion occupation number, which is the expectation value\nof\nN\u0302f =\n\n2k sin q \u2020\n\u00fb * u .\n\u03c0\n\n(6.17)\n\nConsequently, the bosonic and fermionic representations are correlated. Given that\nthe bosonic occupation number is Nb = 2q \u2032 k/\u03c0 we have\nN \u2261 Nb + Nf =\n\n2qk\n.\n\u03c0\n\n(6.18)\n\nWe present the results for the spectrum in Table 1, in particular the SU(2)f \u00d7SU(2)b\nrepresentation content. The striking thing about the spectrum is that the number of\nbosonic and fermionic states match at 2N, and the representations are precisely the\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\ffermionic state\n\nNf\n\nNb\n\nSU(2)b \u00d7 SU(2)f\n\n# states\n\n|0i\n\n0\n\nN\n\n(N + 1, 0)\n\nN+1\n\n\u00fb\u2020i |0i\n\n1\n\nN\u22121\n\n(N, 2)\n\n2N\n\n\u00fb\u20201 \u00fb\u20202 |0i\n\n2\n\nN\u22122\n\n(N \u2212 1, 0)\n\nN\u22121\n\nTable 1: The soliton states with a given value of N and q = \u03c0N\n2k .

In fact, we\nhave already pointed out that the collective coordinates of the classical soliton can\nbe thought of as the projective superspace CP 2|1 which can be described as the\nquotient\nCP 2|1 \u2243\n\nSU(2|2)\n,\nU(2|1)\n\n(6.20)\n\nand so has a natural group of isometries given by the left action of SU(2|2).

Note that it is a target\nspace supersymmetry rather than a worldline supersymmetry. One interesting point\nof this is that the vector in (6.22) appears to be \"renormalized\" by some specific\nscalar factors. Note that these \"wavefunction renormalization\" factors have a well\ndefined perturbative expansion\nsin q\n= 1 + O(k \u22122 ) ,\nq\n\n(6.24)\n\nand may be a result of the schizophrenic way that we have treated the Grassmann\nodd and even collective coordinates. In particular, the tower of states includes the\nperturbative modes at the bottom since those with Nb = 1 form the fundamental\nrepresentation of SU(2|2). For these states the Grassmann odd and even modes are\non the same footing and the renormalization factors are just sin q/q \u223c 1 to leading\norder in the perturbative expansion.\nWe can quantize the system (6.23) directly in a way that keeps the supersymmetry manifest. In fact the quantization of this system is a superspace generalization of\nthe K\u00e4hler quotient construction of the complex projective spaces.

The complication is that the transformations are non-local and this is probably why the supersymmetry in the quantum\ntheory becomes q deformed and so is ultimately not a true symmetry.\nIf we fix the gauge, as in [20, 21, 23], by taking A+ = 0, then A\u2212 remains as a\nLagrange multiplier for the constraint\n\u0001\u22a5\n(A.1)\n\u03b3 \u22121 \u2202+ \u03b3 + 2\u039b\u03c8+ \u03c8+ = 0 .\n\nThe discussion in Section 3, where we constructed the conserved supercurrents in\nthe on-shell gauge A\u03bc = 0, requires some modification when A\u2212 6= 0.
