Substellar objects have extremely long life-spans. The cosmological consequence for older objects are low abundances of heavy\nelements, which results in a wide distribution of objects over metallicity, hence over age. Within their cool atmosphere, dust clouds\nbecome a dominant feature, affecting the opacity and the remaining gas phase abundance of heavy elements. We investigate the influence of the stellar metallicity on the dust formation in substellar atmospheres and on the dust cloud structure and its feedback on the\natmosphere. This work has implications for the general question of star formation and of dust formation in the early universe.\nMethods. We utilize numerical simulations in which we solve a set of moment equations in order to determine the quasi-static dust\ncloud structure (Drift). These equations model the nucleation, the kinetic growth of composite particles, their evaporation and the\ngravitational settling as a stationary dust formation process. Element conservation equations augment this system of equations including the element replenishment by convective overshooting. The integration with an atmosphere code (Phoenix) allows to determine\na consistent (T, p, vconv )-structure (T - local temperature, p - local pressure, vconv - convective velocity), and, hence, also to calculate\nsynthetic spectra.\nResults. A grid of Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres was calculated for a wide range of metallicity, [M/H] \u2208 [+0.5,-0.0,-0.5,...,-6.0],\nto allow for a systematic study of atmospheric cloud structures throughout the evolution of the universe. We find dust clouds in even\nthe most metal-poor ([M/H]=-6.0) atmosphere of brown dwarfs. Only the most massive among the youngest brown dwarfs and giant\ngas planets can resist dust formation. For very low heavy element abundances, a temperature inversion develops which has a drastic\nimpact on the dust cloud structure.\nConclusions. The combination of metal depletion by dust formation and the uncertainty of interior element abundances makes the\nmodeling of substellar atmospheres an intricate problem in particular for old substellar objects. We further show that the dust-to-gas\nratio does not scale linearly with the object's [M/H] for a given effective temperature. The mean grain sizes and the composition of\nthe grains change depending on [M/H] which influences the dust opacity that determines radiative heating and cooling as well as the\nspectral appearance.\nKey words. astrochemistry - Methods: numerical - Stars: atmospheres - Stars: low-mass, brown dwarfs\n\n1. Introduction\nCondensation of supersaturated gas species becomes a major issue in ultracool atmospheres, i.e. that of brown dwarfs and giant\nplanets. The formation of solid dust particles or liquid droplets\ndepletes the gas phase of elements and, hence, strongly affects\nthe chemical composition of the remaining gas phase. In addition, the forming dust particles represent an important opacity\nsource, which ultimately results in a significant backwarming\nand an increased gas temperature compared to a cloud-free atmosphere (Tsuji et al. 1996a).\nBesides the dust formation induced element deficiency, the\nsubstellar object can already have formed from a metal-poor gas,\nhence, being intrinsically metal-deficient. The first generation of\nstars was comprised of extremely massive objects. These stars\nwere responsible for a strong metal enrichment of the interstellar medium, from which new stars formed. The corresponding\nenrichment of the ISM with more and more heavy elements had\nan important impact on the star formation, as it brought about the\ncollapse of much smaller cloud fragments (Smith & Sigurdsson\n2007). Hence, succeeding star generations contained growing\nnumbers of smaller objects. The debate about the lower mass\n\nlimit for stellar formation is still not settled. For solar abundances, simulations by Whitworth & Stamatellos (2006) predict a limit for the mass of collapsing gas clouds as low as\n0.001 to 0.004M\u2299. Results by e.g. Boss (2001) and Bate (2005)\nfall in a similar mass regime. Observations by Greaves et al.\n(2003) and Greaves (2005) present evidence for the formation of objects with masses below the deuterium burning\nlimit via a gravitational collapsing molecular cloud fragment.\nThe presence of discs around 8-10MJup-objects (Natta et al.\n(2002), Luhman et al. (2005), Scholz & Jayawardhana (2008))\nis also evidence for the formation of such low-mass objects\nvia gravitational cloud collaps. According to Omukai (2008)\nand Clark et al. (2008) subsolar mass objects may already have\nformed at [M/H]\u2265-6.0, though heating effects may have obstructed the collapse of low mass gas clouds and depopulated\nthe range between [M/H]=-4.0 and -5.0. Jappsen et al. (2009)\nnote that the transition of the early universe IMF to the present\nday IMF at around [M/H]=10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22125 seem to be determined\nby dust cooling which in turn is determined by the grain size\ndistribution and composition of the dust forming at these low\nmetalicities. Those extreme metallicities can be attributed to a\nmuch earlier state of the universe, when the continuously run-\n\n\f2\n\nS. Witte et al.: Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets\n\nning heavy element enrichment of the interstellar medium by\nnucleosynthesis inside massive stars and supernovae had not\nprogressed as far as today. The implication is a wide distribution of objects over the metallicity range. However, all but the\nlowest mass objects of high age, i.e. of extremely low metallicities, have already exceeded their life-span as main-sequence\nstars. Therefore, only ultracool stars and substellar objects remain from those earlier stages of the universe. Hence, substellar\nspectra need to be characterised not only by effective temperature, Teff , and surface gravity, log(g), but also by the interior,\nwell-mixed element abundances as relic of the conditions at their\nformation.\nThe presence of dust in ultracool dwarf and substellar atmospheres has been suggested first by Lunine et al. (1986) and\nwas noticed by Jones & Tsuji (1997). First observational evidence for convective activity in substellar objects was found by\nNoll et al. (1997) and Oppenheimer et al. (1998). By then, the\nfirst brown dwarfs had just been discovered by Rebolo et al.\n(1995) and Nakajima et al. (1995). The observation of metalpoor ultracool stars in the galactic halo (e.g., Christlieb (2006))\nled to the classification into dwarfs, subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs (Gizis 1997). A later revision of this system was done by\nL\u00e9pine et al. (2007), introducing the even more metal-poor ultrasubdwarfs class. The first substellar subdwarfs were discovered\nby Burgasser et al. (2003) and Burgasser (2004).\nAs the importance of dust clouds in late-M \u2013, L \u2013 and\nT \u2013 type dwarf atmospheres had been recognised, models\nwere developed to help to understand these objects. Initially,\nthe clouds were parameterised by a constant grain size\n(Tsuji et al. 1996b; Burrows et al. 2006), later time-scale arguments were applied (Allard et al. 2001), or grain size distributions guided by Earth-observations were used (Cooper et al.\n2003; Ackerman & Marley 2001). All these models apply complete (S = 1) or almost (S = 1.01) phase-equilibrium. A detailed comparison study of current dust models was made by\nHelling et al. (2008a).\nWe consider a stationary dust formation process, where seeds\nform high up in the atmosphere from a highly supersaturated\ngas, grow to macroscopic particles of around a \u03bcm in size, gravitationally settle into deeper layers and eventually evaporate as\nthe local temperature becomes too high for thermal stability\n(Woitke & Helling 2003). The basic idea is that a \"dirty\" solid\nmantle will grow on top of the seed particles. This dirty mantle\nis assumed to be composed of numerous small islands of different pure condensates. The formation of islands is supported\nby experiments in solid state physics (Ledieu et al. 2005) and\nby observations of coated terrestrial dust particles (Levin et al.\n1996; Korhonen et al. 2003).\n\nequilibrium dust formation with subsequent precipitation and\nelement replenishment by convective overshooting is calculated\nby Drift. The opacities of the composite dust particles, which\nare required for the radiative transfer, are determined by using\neffective medium theory (Bruggeman 1935) and Mie theory\n(Mie 1908; Wolf & Voshchinnikov 2004). All dust species are\nincluded as opacity source since our dust grains are made of a\nmixtures of these compounts.\n2.1. Gas-phase chemistry\n\nThe chemistry in Phoenix considers the 40 most important elements in several ionization states and 47 molecule species.\nThough larger chemical systems are possible, the results differ only marginally (Dehn 2007). For the solar element abundances, defining [M/H]=0.0 in our models, we utilize data from\nGrevesse et al. (1992). We are aware that the elemental composition of brown dwarfs and planets is dependent on the initial composition of the gas cloud they formed from, which itself depends critically on the internal physics of its local preceding star generations, like, e.g., the efficiency of the various\nburning cycles and the resulting amount of elements. Especially\nfor extremely low metallicities, the element abundance pattern is\ncompletely different to the one we know from the solar environment (e.g., Frebel et al. (2005), Campbell & Lattanzio (2008)).\nHowever, we neglect variations of the individual element abundances relative to each other and their impact on metallicity\nmodel sequences for the sake of simplicity and determine the\nvaried metallicity values by a single scaling-factor. These values\nare varied according to the metallicity under consideration such\nthat [M/H]=+0.5 . . . \u2212 6.0.\nThe Phoenix chemistry utilizes the altitude-dependent gas\nphase abundances \u01ebi of the elements Mg, Si, Ti, O, Fe, and\nAl provided by Drift, i.e., it takes into account those element\nabundances which have been altered throughout the atmosphere\nby depletion (nucleation, dust growth), enrichment (evaporation) and redistribution (precipitation, convective overshooting).\nIn the Drift-module, we calculate the number densities of all\ngaseous species, including the number density of the key reackey\ntant nr as described in Woitke & Helling (2004) according to\npressure, temperature and the calculated depth-dependent element abundances \u01ebi in chemical equilibrium. For the well-mixed,\ndeep element abundances \u01ebi0 we use the scaled solar abundances\nof the model input. For those elements that are not included in\nthe Drift chemistry calculations, we set \u01ebi = \u01ebi0 .\n\n3. Growth reactions\n\n2. Method\n\n3.1. Dust seed formation\n\nWe make use of the Drift-Phoenix model atmosphere code,\nintroduced by Dehn (2007) and Helling et al. (2008b).\nThe general-purpose model atmosphere code Phoenix\n(Hauschildt & Baron 1999; Baron et al. 2003) solves the\ngas-phase equation of state, provides the atmosphere structure\nto Drift, determines the gas opacities and solves the radiative\ntransfer. The Drift code by Helling, Woitke, & Thi (2008c)\nis included as a module in order to calculate the dust clouds,\nwhich feed back on both the thermodynamical structures and\nthe radiation field. An iteration of this method allows the determination of the atmosphere and dust cloud properties and yields\nthe corresponding synthetic spectra. For a given atmosphere\nstructure (T, p, vconv), provided by Phoenix, the phase non-\n\nThe nucleation rate J\u22c6 is calculated for (TiO2 )N -clusters according to Eq. (34) in Helling & Woitke (2006), applying the modified classical nucleation theory of Gail et al. (1984). We use the\nvalue of the surface tension \u03c3 fitted to small cluster data by\nJeong et al. (2000) as outlined in Woitke & Helling (2004).\n3.2. Dust growth/evaporation & refractive indices\n\nThe dust growth of dirty particles is modelled according\nto Woitke & Helling (2003), Helling & Woitke (2006) and\nHelling et al. (2008c). However, compared to Helling et al.\n(2008c), we consider only the 7 most important solids (TiO2 [s],\nAl2 O3 [s], Fe[s], SiO2 [s], MgO[s], MgSiO3 [s], Mg2 SiO4 [s])\n\n\fS.

Our selection is\nguided by the most stable condensates which yet have simple\nstoichiometric ratios, ensuring that these solids can be easily\nbuilt up from the gas phase (for more details see Sect. 3.4. in\nHelling, Woitke, & Thi (2008c)). Note that we consider dust formation by gas-solid reactions only and omit solid-solid reactions\nand lattice rearrangements inside the grains in our model (see\nHelling & Rietmeijer (2009) regarding lattice rearrangements in\nclouds in substellar atmospheres). Table 1 also contains the solid\nrefractive index data used in the Mie calculations.\n3.3. Element replenishment\n\nA truly static atmosphere would not contain any dust\n(Woitke & Helling 2004). Therefore, we include mixing by convection and overshooting by assuming an exponential decrease\nof the mass exchange frequency in the radiative zone (Eq. 9 in\n(Woitke & Helling 2004) with \u03b2 = 2.2 and \u03c4min\nmix = 2/(Hp vconv )),\nwhich serves to replenish the upper atmospheres and keeps the\ncycle of dust formation running.\n\nFig. 1.

Grain size distribution function\n\nThe dust opacity calculations with effective medium theory\nand Mie theory require the grain size distribution function\nf (a) [cm\u22124 ] at every depth in the atmosphere, where a [cm] is\nthe grain radius.

In this paper, we apply the double delta-peaked size distribution function\nf (a) = N1 \u03b4(a \u2212 a1 ) + N2 \u03b4(a \u2212 a2 ) where \u03b4 is the Dirac-function,\nN1 , N2 [cm\u22123 ] are two dust particle densities and a1 , a2 [cm] are\nthe two corresponding particle radii.\n\n\f4\n\nS. Witte et al.: Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets\n\n4. Results: The model grid\nIn this section we will describe the influence of metallicity on\nthe model atmospheres and the dust cloud. This will be done\nfor three showcase model sequences to exemplarily cover the\nparameter space for effective temperature and surface gravity\nwhich covers brown dwarfs and giant gas planets. We think that\nsuch a detailed demonstration of our dust model results is necessary as dust cloud model for brown dwarfs differ considerably\nwith respect to dust properties (Helling et al. 2008a).\nThe sequences are calculated for:\nTeff = 2000K and log(g)=5.0,\nTeff = 2500K and log(g)=5.0\nTeff = 2000K and log(g)=3.0,\ncovering the metallicity values [M/H] \u2208 [+0.5,-0.0,-0.5,...,-6.0].\nIn the following, we will concentrate on only [M/H]\u2208[+0.5,-0.0,1.5,-4.0,-6.0].\n4.1. Metallicity-dependent temperature-pressure structures\n\nAt first, we will take a look how the temperature-pressure structures are affected by the metallicity (Fig. 1). As one might expect, the local temperature decreases with [M/H] for a fixed\npressure, due to the smaller gas opacities. However, the outer\natmospheres of the low [M/H] models feature a strong temperature inversion. It is caused by a tilt in the chemical equilibrium,\nfavouring the formation of methane instead of carbon monoxide,\nwhich frees up oxygen for the formation of water and metal oxides (e.g., Allard & Hauschildt (1995)). The inversion becomes\nstronger for higher effective temperatures and higher surface\ngravities for a given [M/H]-value.\nFigure 1 demonstrates that the local pressure increases for a\ngiven local temperature with decreasing metallicity but with increasing gravity. This relative pressure increase strengthens the\ncontribution of strongly pressure-dependent gas-phase opacity\nsources like the collision induced absorption but also the contribution of the pressure-broadened alkali lines. Fortney et al.\n(2008) present similar findings for cooler substellar objects with\nTeff . 1400K. Hence, the effect of increasing pressure with decreasing metal content holds across the whole substellar range of\nTeff . Therefore, clouds in giant planets but also in low-metallicity\nsubstellar objects form at even lower gas temperatures at a comparable pressure (see Sect. 4.3).\nThe dust clouds represent a strong opacity source. Therefore,\nthe backwarming caused by the dust particles strongly increases\nthe local gas temperature at and below the cloud location. Hence,\ndense cloud layers coincide with a strong inward temperature\ngradient. Especially the high [M/H] models feature two bends\naround 1500K and 2000K. The drop of the local temperature gradient is caused by the starting evaporation of the solid\nspecies. The lower temperature bend is attributed to the evaporation of the silicate species (MgO[s], SiO2 [s], MgSiO3 [s],\nMg2 SiO4 [s]), while the second corresponds to evaporation of the\nthermally more stable species (Fe[s], TiO2 [s], Al2 O3 [s]).\nIn the Teff =2000K model for log(g)=5.0 and [M/H]=-4.0,\nthere is a bump in the (T,p)-structure around 6*106 dyn cm\u22122 .\nIt already appears for [M/H]=-2.0 and remains until [M/H]=5.0. The origin is the superposition of two effects, namely the\ndecreasing deep interior abundances and the decreasing depletion of the gas phase with the metallicity. This causes a locally\nhigher absolute Ti abundance in the gas phase compared to atmospheres of even higher metallicities. The opacity by the re-\n\nsulting increased amount of TiO is the reason for this feature in\nthe (T,p)-structure.\n4.2. Metallicity influence on the (vconv , p)-structure\n\nSolar-metallicity models ([M/H]=0.0) suggest that the dust\ncloud location and the convectively unstable zone are well separated. Even so, convection provides a mechanism for element\nreplenishment of the upper atmosphere layer, which assures stationarity of the cloud formation process. The so-called convective overshooting is parameterised in Drift by a mixing-time\nscale (Woitke & Helling 2004) following the idea of momentum\nconservation of the convective mass elements (see Ludwig et al.\n(2002, 2006)) whose motion does not instantly end where the\nSchwarzschild criterion is no longer met, but decays slowly into\nthe higher layers (Woitke & Helling 2004). A higher maximum\nconvection velocity consequently yields a more efficient mixing\ninto the upper layers.\nDue to the vanishing local opacities with decreasing [M/H],\nthe radiative flux is less obstructed and, hence, the convective energy transport becomes less important. For this reason, the convection zone is shifted inwards to higher pressures and densities\nfor decreasing metallicities. According to mixing length theory,\nthe resulting mean convection velocity vconv decreases, which\nresults in a less efficient convective overshooting. Because of a\nweaker radiation field for decreasing effective temperatures and\nhigher gas densities for increasing surface gravity, one finds a\nsimilar effect on the convective velocity and overshooting for\nthese parameters.\nHence, the convective overshooting is more efficient in hot,\nlow-gravity objects. An improved mixing consequently enables\nthe dust cloud to persist into higher atmosphere layers. Hence,\nhot-Jupiters should have high-altitude clouds which supports\nwhat Richardson et al. (2007) and Pont et al. (2008) suggested\nfor their observed giant gas planets.\n4.3. Metallicity-dependent cloud structure\n\nWe study the influence of the stellar metallicity on the dust cloud\nstructure to provide insight into possible diversities of cloud\nproperties for substellar objects originating from different evolutionary states of the universe, i.e. for objects which have formed\nfrom interstellar gas clouds of different metal-enrichment.\nFigure 2 contains the results including the (T, p)-structures\nfor better comparison. Depicted are the number of dust particles\nforming per volume element and time, i.e. the nucleationPrate\nJ\u2217 [cm\u22123 s\u22121 ] (2nd panel), the net growth velocity \u03c7net = s \u03c7s\n[cm s\u22121 ] (3rd panel;\n\u221a Eq. (7) in Helling thet al.

The general, high-[M/H] cloud structure\n\nAs is shown in Fig. 2, all high metallicity models exhibit a typical cloud structure which was already shown in our previous\npublications. At the highest altitudes with its dust-poor depleted\ngas (compare Woitke & Helling (2004)), dust seeds form which\nare unable to grow perceptibly due to the extremely low densities at these altitudes. The mean grain size, hai, remains of the\norder of the seed particle size. Due to the low density, the num-\n\n\fS. Witte et al.: Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets\n\n5\n\nFig. 2. Cloud structures for three model sequences of varying metallicity [M/H].

The net grain growth velocity, \u03c7net , increases proportionally\nto the gas density, while the drift velocity, hvdr i, decreases. From\na certain depth downward, the mean particle size increases from\nthe initial size of the seeds. Together with the increasing nucleation rate, the dust growth starts to cause a steep drop of the local\ngas-phase element abundances with depth (compare Fig. 6). The\nconsequence is that the growth velocity eventually decreases to\na degree, that the particles settle too fast to sustain a perceptible growth of the mean grain radius at this low-pressure region. Gravitational settling does not influence the process of seed\nformation since nucleation proceeds much faster. However, the\nstrong gas-phase depletion will impede the formation of more\nseeds as less material is available. As the precipitating particles drop into atmosphere layers which are closer to the edge\nof the convection zone, the convective upmixing becomes more\nefficient. The more efficient mixing results in a continuously increasing nucleation rate with depth as more material is available\nto form seed from. The gas-phase depletion by the exponential\nincrease of the number of new seed particles compensates for\nthe on-going growth of the grains. Hence, the mean grain radius\nremains constant, even though there is growth, which is strong\nenough to cause a exponentially decreasing element abundances,\nshown in Fig. 6. In this region, the dust cloud becomes optically\nthick enough to cause a perceptible backwarming of up to several\nhundred degrees (Fig. 1). As the local temperatures are increasing and the abundances are decreasing with depth, the nucleation\nrate reaches its apex and drops to zero very fast over the next few\natmospheric layers. This also means, the particle production has\nreached its maximum. Hence, dust existing in deeper layers must\nhave rained in from above. Therefore, changes in the number\ndensity of the dust particles in these deeper atmospheric layers\n\nare caused by accumulation, drift and evaporation. Interestingly,\nthe dust number density remains of the same order compared to\nthe site of the nucleation maximum, but the grain size distribution changes dramatically.\nThe end of nucleation sparks a strong increase of the mean\ngrain size. The frictional force caused by the high densities at\nthese layers has strongly decreased the drift velocity. Thus, it\ntakes the dust particles much longer to cross a given atmospheric\nlayer. This allows the particles to capture more and more reactants from the gas phase, resulting in an even stronger growth.\nIn turn, the mean grain radius causes an increase of the drift\nvelocity. This is balanced by the increasing gas density, which\nis why we observe a plateau-like feature in the drift velocity\n(Fig. 2, lowest panel). The numerous \u03bcm-sized particles below\nthe nucleation maximum cause a strong backwarming.\nAs soon as the evaporation of a certain species exceeds its\ngrowth, it is vanishing from the solid phase. This is accompanied\nby a decreasing and possibly even negative growth velocity. That\nis the reason for the observed kinks (Fig. 2) in the mean grain\nradius curves and all consequential kinks in other quantities like,\ne.g., the effective temperature, as mention in Sec. 4.1. As soon as\nthe last solid species starts to evaporate, the dust cloud typically\nvanishes very fast with depth.\n4.3.2. The influence of metallicity on the cloud structure\n\nThe convective mixing becomes less efficient with decreasing\n[M/H] (Sec. 4.2). Thus, the dust clouds are located at higher\ngas pressures and densities for lower [M/H]. However, this is\nalso caused by an additional factor, which is a temperature inversion in the outer atmosphere (Sec. 4.1, Fig. 1), developing\nfor metallicities below [M/H]=-3.0. Within this inversion zone,\nthe gas phase is no longer supersaturated for the lowest consid-\n\n\f6\n\nS. Witte et al.: Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets\n\nered metallicities. Thus, no dust can form there and the typical\nstructure of undisturbed dust clouds is lost. In these model atmospheres, the dust cloud is bottled up in a temperature \"valley\"\nbetween the inversion zone and the hotter inner atmosphere. This\nvalley becomes more destinctive for increasing surface gravity,\ni.e., it will vanish for planet-like objects but persist within the\ncoolest amongst the brown dwarfs (Fig. 1).\nDepending on metallicity, the atmospheres can have one\nor two zones of efficient nucleation, i.e. two nucleation rate\nmaxima J\u2217max . High-metallicity models show only the outer\nnucleation zone, as reported by Woitke & Helling (2003) and\nHelling, Woitke, & Thi (2008c). Very metal-deficient models\n([M/H]<-4.0) develop a very shallow outer nucleation zone and\nan additional inner zone of much more efficient seed formation. The outer nucleation zone is already indicative for a layer\nof haze. Nucleation takes place throughout the dust cloud for\nlow metallicities in contrast to the higher metallicity models,\nwhere nucleation ceases in the middle of the cloud. Generally,\nthe maximum nucleation rate is decreasing with metallicity\ndown to [M/H]=-3.0, even though the maximum is shifted inwards to higher densities. The sole exception to this trend is\nthe [M/H]=+0.5 atmosphere model in the hottest sequence presented here (Teff =2500K), which counterintuitively shows a\nsmaller J\u2217 than the lower-metallicity models of that sequence.\nSince the gas temperature is already high in this model, not much\nbackwarming is needed to move the model out of the temperature window of efficient nucleation (compare 1st and 2nd panel\nin Fig 2).\nFor lower metallicities ([M/H]< \u22123.0), the trend of decreasing nucleation maximum with [M/H] is reversed due to the appearance of the second, inner J\u2217max . The reason for this is the\nstrongly decreasing local temperature above the convection zone\nwith decreasing metallicity, which allows a strong supersaturation (compare Sect. 4.4). The result is a growing second maximum of the nucleation rate with decreasing metallicity at the\ncloud base.\nOur results show that dust may persist down to extremly low\nvalues of metallicity. A combination of low metallicity, high effective temperature and low surface gravity is required to prevent\nthe formation of dust clouds. Therefore, only the log(g)=3.0 sequence, representing the planetary atmospheres in our sample,\nfeatures no dust at all for [M/H]<-4.0.\nThe growth velocity of the mean particle typically has two\nlocal maxima. The outer maximum of the growth velocity decreases and is shifted to higher pressures for decreasing metallicities. It vanishes as soon as the temperature inversion sets in\nfor [M/H]< \u22124.0. The deeper located second maximum of the\ngrowth velocity is also shifted inwards. However, it is neither\naffected by the temperature inversion, nor does it decrease continuously with the metallicity, because the inward shift brings it\nmuch closer to the convection zone and therefore a more efficient\nelement replenishment. Around [M/H]=-4.0 the cloud indeed\ndips into the convection zone for our young giant planet-like\nmodels (Teff =2000K, log(g)=3.0), which sparks an additional\ngrowth by one order of magnitude in those models.\nDue to the proximity to the convection zone and the resulting high growth velocity, the maximum mean grain radius increases slightly with decreasing metallicity down to [M/H]=-3.5.\nOnly for lower metallicities, the decreasing abundances are finally able to cause a decreasing maximum mean grain size.\nThe drift velocity decreases much stronger for lower effective temperatures and to a lesser extend for higher surface gravities. As a lower drift velocity results in a stronger accumula-\n\ntion of dust particles, the number density in the lower cloud is\nstrongly increasing with decreasing effective temperature.\n4.4. The phase-non-equilibrium of the clouds\n\nThe thermodynamic conditions in an undepleted substellar atmosphere guarantee a strong supersaturation of a wide range of\nsolid compounds. An initial high supersaturation does not automatically yield a phase equilibrium between the depleted atmosphere and the dust cloud as such (Helling, Woitke, & Thi\n2008c). The phase equilibrium would require a sufficiently high\nnumber density of reactants as well as high collision and reaction\nrates. However, this is usually not the case for most of the solids\nof interest. Therefore, all three quantities need to be considered\nin order to avoid the overrated dust growth and gas phase depletion of the phase equilibrium approach. According to our model\n(see Woitke & Helling (2003); Helling & Woitke (2006)), most\nof the atmosphere is in phase non-equilibrium, a chemical equivalent to the NLTE state of radiation fields.\nSolid grains or liquid droples are composed of so-called\nmonomer units. Experiments show that most of the complex\nmonomers like Mg2 SiO4 do not exist in the gas phase (e.g.\nRietmeijer et al. (1999)). The formation of such solid units\nwould require multi body reactions which makes the probability for their formation in the gas neglegibly small. On the other\nhand, if the reactants are physically absorbed by a preexisting\nsurface, their limited phase space permits a much more efficient growth reaction. The reactant of the least physically absorbed amount is called the key species. Its absorption rate determines the rate of the considered chemical surface reaction\nand, hence, also the supersaturation ratio for each surface reaction (Helling & Woitke 2006). In order to discuss the saturation of the atmosphere, we apply the effective supersaturation ratio for each considered solid compound as defined in\nHelling, Woitke, & Thi (2008c).\nThe effective supersaturation ratios for each of the considered solid species for the three model sequences are shown in\nFig. 3. For the higher metallicities, the outer atmosphere has\nextremely high supersaturation ratios. The ratio is increasing\nwith the pressure, because the concentration of reactants increases with the pressure. Further inwards, the supersaturation\nratio reaches a maximum where the dust growth starts to cause\na strong depletion of the gas phase. Below that point, the supersaturation decreases proportionally to the dwindling element\nabundances. At a certain layer, each of the ratios reaches unity.\nIn agreement with Helling, Woitke, & Thi (2008c) and Helling\n(2009) we find that all solids which contain high-abundant elements (Mg, Si, O, Fe) achieve phase-equilibrium in the pressure interval where the cloud has it's maximum dust-to-gas ratio,\n\u03c1d /\u03c1gas (compare Figs. 3 and 5), before the supersaturation ratios\ndrop further below unity. Solids which contain rare elements (Ti,\nAl) do not feature a phase-equilibrium region.\nFor decreasing abundances, a higher gas density is required\nto reach the same amount of supersaturation. However, the supersaturation becomes weaker for lower metallicities. This, superimposed with the temperature inversion zone of the low\nmetallicity models, results in a fast drop below unity of all supersaturation ratios, which means no dust is able to form there.\nFortunate for the dust cloud in the low metallicity models is the\ndecreasing gas temperature between the inversion zone and the\nconvection zone. Even though the element abundances are decreasing with the metallicity, the low temperatures bring about\na larger concentration of reactants. Therefore, the supersatura-\n\n\fS.

Therefore, this model is dust free.\n4.5. Metallicity-dependence of the cloud composition\n\nPure silicate dust grains are mostly transparent. TiO2 [s] and\nAl2 O3 [s] also do not represent strong opacities. However, even\na small impurity can turn the transparency into opaqueness\n(Woitke 2006). This means, there is a huge difference between\na mixture of pure grains and mixture of \"dirty\" grains. Hence,\ntogether with the grain size distribution, the composition of the\nmean particle is of special importance for the radiative transfer\nand, thus, for the spectrum.\nDrift was designed to treat the formation of dirty grains.\nTherefore, it considers grains consisting of islands of mixed\nspecies. The composition changes with atmospheric depth and\nthe stellar parameters. The results for the three examples sequences are shown in Fig. 4. As TiO2 [s] is the solid species\nwhich forms the dust seeds, the particles in the outer cloud are\nsolely made of it. Ti is rare compared to the other five considered\nelements. Thus, as soon as growth becomes an issue, the volume\nfraction of TiO2 [s] decreases fast. At the higher cloud layers,\nwhere the temperatures are lower, the silicates with traces of iron\ndominate the dust grains. The temperatures increase with depth,\neventually leading to the evaporation of the silicates, while the\ngrowth of iron becomes much more efficient, resulting in very\nopaque particles. Slightly deeper, Al2 O3 [s] growth dominates\nthe volume of the average grains.\nWe find that the inward shift of the dust cloud yields a\nstronger maximum of the iron volume fraction. The opposite\nhappens with the Al2 O3 [s] maximum, which becomes weaker.\n\nThe chemical equilibrium for the lower metallicities is\nchanged, which leads to a significant preference of MgO[s] over\nthe other silicates for [M/H]\u2264-4.0 (Fig. 4, left column). This effect is most pronounced in objects with strong dust formation\nand the accompanying strong gas phase depletion. For higher\neffective temperatures (Fig. 4, middle column), it can not be observed in our models due to the much weaker depletion, which\nyields a delay of the chemical equilibrium shift to even lower\nmetallicities. In the lower temperature, low gravity sequence\n(Fig. 4, right column) the effect is simply not observable because\nno dust is present in the respective low metallicity models for\nthe given effective temperature of 2000K. However, the changed\nchemical equilibrium can be observed for these low gravities as\nsoon as the temperatures permit the formation of dust. Hence,\nthe change from silicate to MgO[s] dominated dust grains for extremely low metallicities is observable for cooler objects. Higher\nsurface gravities emphasize the extend of the shift.\nThe appearing temperature inversion zone in the low metallicity models for high gravities causes the disappearance of the\nwide silicate dominated cloud region, leaving an almost pure\nFe[s] and Al2 O3 [s] cloud.\n4.6. The atmospheric dust content\n\nThe dust to gas ratio of the mass densities, \u03c1d /\u03c1gas , is a good\nmeasure for the amount of dust within the atmosphere (Fig. 5).\nA lower metallicity typically yields a lower \u03c1d /\u03c1gas . The exception to this is again the Teff =2500K [M/H]=+0.5 model, because\nof the high temperatures (Sec. 4.3). One might assume that the\ndust content would scale linearly with the element abundances.\nHowever, it is not that simple, because the observed inward shift\nof the dust clouds with decreasing metallicity yields a higher\nconcentration of condensable elements. This density effect partially counteracts the decreasing abundances due to decreasing\nmetallicities. It becomes more pronounced for cooler, low grav-\n\n\f8\n\nS. Witte et al.: Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets\n\nFig. 4. Volume fractions, Vs /Vtot , for three model sequences of varying metallicity [M/H].: Left: Teff =2000K, log(g)=5.0; Center:\nTeff =2500K, log(g)=5.0; Right: Teff =2000K, log(g)=3.0\nity objects. For example, the maximum dust content decreases\nby merely 2.5 orders of magnitude between [M/H]=+0.5 and\n[M/H]=-4.0 in the Teff =2000K log(g)=5.0 sequence. Only when\nthe cloud is not able to sink any deeper this trend ends and the\ndust content is finally approaching a linear scaling with the abundances.\n4.7. Remaining gas phase abundances\n\nDust formation reduces the local element abundances in the gas\nphase, until nucleation and growth become so weak that the depletion is fully balanced by the replenishment. At its minimum,\nthe gas phase abundances \u01ebi of the more rare elements can reach\nvalues below 10\u22126 of their deep interior abundance \u01ebi,0 . Titanium\nis the least abundant of the six presently considered condensing elements. Especially in the outer atmosphere, which is only\nweakly affected by convective overshooting but its conditions\nallow seed formation, titanium is extremely depleted (Fig. 6).\nAs the efficiency of dust growth increases inwards, the depletion gets stronger. Eventually, this ends as soon as the inwards increasing element consumption by the dust formation\nstops to outbalance the increase of the gas density. This is due to\nthe inwards decreasing supersaturation of the gas and the consequently less efficient growth. For supersaturation ratios below\nunity, the respective solids evaporate, returning their constituents\nto the gas phase. This enrichment can reach values of twice the\ndeep interior model abundances.\nThe depletion follows the shifts of the dust cloud with the\nstellar parameters. There are two opposing influences on the dust\ngrowth, which cause changes in the depletion. A deeper located\ncloud features a more efficient growth because of the higher density. However, the inwards shift caused by a decreasing metallicity is accompanied by a decreasing growth efficiency. Hence,\nthere is a metallicity for which the latter effect starts to cancel the former, resulting in a turn from increasing to decreasing\nmaximum value of the relative depletion with decreasing metal-\n\nlicity. For Teff =2000K and log(g) =5.0 we find this maximum\ndepletion around [M/H]=-1.0. For higher effective temperature\nthe turning point metallicity value is increasing, while it is decreasing for lower surface gravity.\nWe conclude that the strong depletion, observed in our models, can have a tremendous influence on absorption line profiles.\nFor wavelengths at which the dust cloud is mostly transparent,\none is able to see the deep and undepleted atmosphere layers.\nDue to their high density these layers will dominate the respective spectral lines. Because these layers are not depleted by dust\nformation, the full element abundances will be seen in the spectral lines. However, for the wavelengths at which the dust cloud\nis opaque, the observed abundances will not resemble the wellmixed interior abundances of the object. Depending on the wavelength, the observed abundances can be several orders of magnitude lower than the actual ones. Therefore, it is extremely complex to derive individual stellar abundances from spectral lines\nin dust-forming environments in general.\n4.8. Dust content and grain size above \u03c4=1\n\nIn the previous sections, the spatial distribution of dust within\nsubstellar atmospheres was analysed. It remains to be verified\nhow much dust is observationally accessible, e.g., by polarimetry. In Fig. 7 we show the local gas pressure at the maximum of\nthe dust-to-gas ratio P(max{\u03c1d /\u03c1g }), the corresponding optical\ndepth \u03c4 and mean grain size hai for all three model sequences\n(compare to Fig. 2 and 5).\nFigure 7 shows optical depth values for one single wavelength sample (1.2\u03bcm; \u03c41.2\u03bcm ) and for the Planck-, Rosseland, mean intensity- and surface-normal flux-weighted opacities\n(\u03c4B , \u03c4ross , \u03c4J and \u03c4F , respectively). At 1.2\u03bcm the atmospheres\nare highly transparent. In contrast, the weighted optical depth\nmeans, in particular \u03c4B which in case of the considered cool\natmospheres emphasizes on the near-infrared where the dust is\nmost opaque, are typically larger by one to two orders of magni-\n\n\fS. Witte et al.: Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets\n\n9\n\nFig. 6. Element abundances, \u01ebi , for three model sequences of varying metallicity [M/H]. Left: Teff =2000K, log(g)=5.0; Center:\nTeff =2500K, log(g)=5.0; Right: Teff =2000K, log(g)=3.0\ntude. The Rosseland mean is the lowest of the considered mean\noptical depths, as it puts emphasis on the wavelengths of lowest\nopacity.\nThe dust-to-gas ratio maximum, max{\u03c1d /\u03c1g }, is shifted inwards for decreasing metallicities down to [M/H]=-3.0. . .-4.0,\nwith the exact value depending on the stellar parameters.\nFor lower values, the \u03c1d /\u03c1g -maximum rises in altitude, again\n(Fig. 5). Therefore, all curves in Fig. 7 feature a sharp turn in\nlocal pressure around these metallicities. This clearly demonstates the non-linear influence of the metallicity on the dust content in substellar atmospheres. Between about [M/H]=-0.5 and\n+1.0 the mean grain size and the optical depths remain more\nor less constant in all three model sequences, although the gas\npressure changes by almost one order of magnitude. For lower\n[M/H] down to [M/H]\u2248-3.5, the optical depths start to decrease\nslowly, while the size of the visible dust particles is increasing\nby about one half order of magnitude. This amplitude becomes\nstronger for closer proximities to the convection zone, which in\nour case concerns the low metallicity models of the Teff =2000K\nand log(g)=3.0 sequence. In general, this means larger particles\nare present in the visible dense cloud layers for decreasing metallicities down to [M/H]\u2248-3.5. The mean particle sizes increase up\nto several 10\u03bcm, making it once more difficult to observe the major fraction of the dust in the optically thin parts of the cloud.\nThe outward shift of the dust-to-gas ratio maximum below\n[M/H]\u2248-3.5 amplifies the decreasing abundances, which results\nin a strong decline of the visible particle size, while the optical\ndepth is continuously decreasing with the metallicity. The optical depth rise for increasing metal abundances becomes stronger\nfor lower effective temperatures as the amount of dust becomes\nmuch larger and the dust opacity is increasingly affected by solid\niron.\nIn order to show trends for the amount and average size of\nvisible particles, it is best to choose a mean optical depth which\nfocuses on those wavelengths at which the dust opacity has a\nstrong impact, i.e., where \u03c4 = 1 is located within the cloud.\nFrom Fig. 7 one can see that \u03c4B is the best applicable optical\ndepth of our five examples. Hence, Fig. 8 depicts the dust-to-gas\n\nratio and mean grain size at \u03c4B = 1 for varied metallicities. From\nFig. 7 it is obvious that the dust clouds for Teff =2500K are not\nstrongly enough developed, which is why \u03c4 = 1 is only reached\nbelow the clouds for all considered metallicities. Hence, there is\nneither a dust-to-gas ratio nor a grain size for Teff =2500K sampled in Fig. 8. For the same reason, there are no data points for\nTeff =2000K, log(g)=3.0 and [M/H]\u2264-4.0 and the Teff =2000K,\nlog(g)=5.0 and [M/H]=-6.0 model. Both curves shown for the\ndust-to-gas ratio back the simple assumption that the ratio is decreasing with metallicity. However, the visible dust-to-gas ratio\nin both model sequences drops by merely two orders of magnitude between [M/H]=+1.0 and [M/H]=-3.5 (compare Sec. 4.6).\nThis apparent discrepancy can explained by the cooler atmospheres for lower metallicities, which enable the dust cloud to\nform in atmosphere layers of higher gas pressure, which involves\na much more efficient dust formation. This increase in efficiency\nis able to slow down the decrease of the dust-to-gas ratio with\nthe metallicity. Only for metallicities below [M/H]=-3.5 the atmospheres will not become significantly cooler for lower metallicities. Thus, the cloud is no longer able to sink any deeper and\nthe dust-to-gas ratio is finally dropping fast with metallicity, until the gas is no longer supersaturated and no dust is able to form.\n\nIn contrast to the visible dust-to-gas ratio, the mean\ngrain size at \u03c4B =1 is increasing for lower metal abundances.\nComparing Fig. 2 and Fig. 7 one finds that this is due to the\nhigher gas densities at low metallicity clouds. In addition, the\nclose proximity of the convection zone yields additional growth\nof the mean grain size for the log(g)=3.0 sequence, which is visible for [M/H]\u2264-2.5. For a higher surface gravity (log(g)=5.0)\nthis is of lesser concern, as it is only visible in the spike at\n[M/H]=-3.5. For lower metallicities, the dust cloud is no longer\nshifted to higher pressures. Therefore, the dust growth becomes\npurely affected by the decreasing abundance and the visible particles become smaller and smaller.\n\n\f10\n\nS. Witte et al.: Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets\n\nFig. 9. Spectral sequences. The red crosses indicate the photometric fluxes in J, H and K bands as they would be observed by 2MASS\nwith the respective J, H and K filters. See also Tab. 2. Note that the flux scales differ between individual plots.\n\n5. Results: Spectral appearance\n5.1. Spectral energy distribution for varied metallicities\n\nThe model spectra sequences, including additional spectra for\n[M/H]=-0.5, are shown in Fig. 9. For a better comparison of the\nshape of the spectra, they were binned to a lower resolution. For\nconvenience, Tab. 2 contains photometric flux data for the three\nmodel sequences. We add a note of caution as these results might\nsuggest an easy comparison with other atmosphere simulations.\nHelling et al. (2008a) did show that different approaches of modelling dust in substellar atmospheres can yield different results\nalready for quantities like mean grain size and dust-to-gas ratio\n(see their Fig. 2) that determine the dust opacity in the radiative transfer calculations. Their comparison of synthetic colours\nsuggests an uncertainty between 10%\u201330% in the 2MASS JHKs\ncolours amongst the different atmosphere simulations.\nThe high metallicity models contain strong molecular absorption features. Most prominent are the water and carbonmonoxide bands between 1.0 and 3.5\u03bcm. For [M/H]=-1.5 these\nbands have almost completely vanished in the high log(g) models. In the low log(g) models, the same happens for slightly\nlower metallicities. The overall spectra start become much\nbluer, as collision induced absorption (CIA) becomes significant. However, the dust opacity is still strong enough to conceal atmospheric regions of strong CIA and therefore compen-\n\nsate its growing influence below 1.0\u03bcm and to cause a strong\nabsorption between 1.0 and 2.0\u03bcm. Hence, the dust cloud delays\nthe trend of the spectra appearing bluer. Reduction of the metal\nabundances starts to change this, however. In the [M/H]=-2.5\nmodels, the dust cloud has already become way too transparent in the infrared to cover the strong CIA opacity below. The\nimpact of CIA is by orders larger than the impact of the dust.\nDespite that, the dust opacity is far from neglegible. Especially\nat wavelengths shorter than 1.5\u03bcm the spectrum is still stronly\naffected by the dust. While all other opacities vanish fast with\nthe metallicities, the alkali lines in the optical and near-infrared\nare getting stronger down to [M/H]=-4.0. This is because the\nview into deeper atmospheric layers becomes possible, where\nthe pressure and density are higher, causing higher collision rates\nand thereby stronger lines (Johnas 2007). For even lower metallicities, the dust opacity vanishes and the alkali lines get weaker.\nThe most extreme metallicity examples ([M/H]=-6.0) are almost\nfeatureless in their spectra. The dust opacity is finally insignificant, while the spectral shape is alone determined by CIA.\nUnfortunately, none of our model spectra show any significantly strong dust opacity features in the near- and midIR, which might provide a good tool to observationally test\nthe dust properties other than by polarimetry (Sengupta 2008;\nLecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2008).\n\n\fS.

Our standard data set for the present\nmodel grid corresponds to the results of Grevesse et al. (1992),\nhereafter called Grevesse (old). We compare these result to models, using the newer results by Grevesse et al. (2007), hereafter\nGrevesse (new). The third configuration is in accordance with the\n\n\f12\n\nS.

Note that the\ndust cloud is not optically thick for Teff =2500K and, hence, is\nlocated above \u03c4B = 1, which is why there are no data points\nfor this effective temperature. For the same reason, there are\nno data point for Teff =2000K, log(g)=3.0 and [M/H]\u2264-4.0. and\nTeff =2000K, log(g)=5.0 and [M/H]\u2264-6.0.\n\nFig. 10. Temperature and dust cloud structure for three different solar abundance data sets: Grevesse (old) corresponds to\nGrevesse et al. (1992), Grevesse (new) to Grevesse et al. (2007)\nand Caffau to the Grevesse et al. (2007) data, but using the revised O-abundance by Caffau et al. (2008)\nGrevesse (new) models, except that we use the revised oxygen\nabundance determined by Caffau et al. (2008), in the following\nshortened to Caffau.\nIn general, the differences between our results for the three\nconfigurations remain extremely small, concerning the atmosphere and dust cloud structures. Compared to Grevesse et al.\n\n(1992) most element abundance values have been adjusted in\nGrevesse et al. (2007) (Grevesse (new)). However, although the\nphysics considered for the determination the solar photospheric\nabundances may have been refined, their basis is quite the same.\nHence, the values of both sets do not differ considerably for the\nmajority of elements. The Grevesse (new) configuration contains a mostly smaller amount of the more abundant heavy elements. The consequence is a smaller gas opacity, which, in\nturn, results in few Kelvins cooler atmosphere, see uppermost\npanel Fig. 10. The oxygen abundance of Caffau lies in between\nboth Grevesse configurations. Thus, the respective model properties are in between as well, though somewhat more resembling Grevesse (old) with its even higher oxygen abundance.\nConcerning the dust, the slightly reduced molecular abundances\nyield a similar result as a decrease of the metallicity, but on a\nmuch smaller scale. The whole dust cloud is marginally shifted\ninwards from Grevesse (old) over Caffau to Grevesse (new). The\nresulting higher gas density at the cloud balances the reduced\nabundances with respect to the concentration of reactants, which\ncontribute to the dust growth. Therefore, the mean grain sizes\nand number densities remain almost unaffected. The conclusion\nis that our integrated dust cloud / atmosphere model structures\nare very stable against slight abundance variations.\nThe corresponding spectra (Fig. 11) can differ remarkably,\nespecially in the near-infrared. Hence, in contrast to the dust,\nthe photometry of the models depends significantly on the abundance data set, possibly much stronger than our limited test\nshows. This is particularly interesting for studies on the lowmetallicity class of substellar subdwarfs (Burgasser et al. 2009)\nas the interior element abundance pattern can deviate from the\nsolar abundances already for moderate subsolar metallicities of\n[M/H]. \u22122.0 caused by deviations in the star formation history, which has been observed in e.g., the Carina dwarf galaxy\n(Koch et al. 2008). A simple scaling of the element abundances\nmight not be sufficient. The interpretation of low-metallicity\nsubstellar objects, therefore, represents a multi-fold challenge:\nThese object are suggested to still produce dust in their atmospheres, hence, deplete the elements in an inhomogeneous way.\nAdditionally, the subdwarfs might exhibit a strongly non-solar\nelement abundance pattern depending on the history of their starformation region.\nIn order to estimate the influence of extreme abundance patterns like in the early universe on the atmosphere models, we\nhave calculated such a model for Teff =2000K and log(g)=5.0,\nfeaturing an observed early universe element abundance pattern\nreported by Frebel et al. (2008). Therein, most heavy elements\nare considerably less abundant than in the solar environment. On\n\n\fS. Witte et al.: Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets\n\n13\n\nstar formation. Our results provide first theoretically obtained information on low-metallicity dust characteristics that determine\nthe opacity, and we, therefore, generally conclude that\n\u2013 Dust can form at very low metallicities but the dust-to-gas\nratio decreases with decreasing metallicity.\n\u2013 The mean grain size decrease with decreasing metalicities\nfor a given local temperature and density leaving behind a\nless depleted gas phase then for higher metalicities.\n\u2013 The dust material composition changes from Mg/Si-silicatedominated to MgO/Fe-dominated with decreasing metallicity at about [M/H]=-4.0.\n\nFig. 12. Comparison of a standard spectrum for Teff =2000K,\nlog(g)=5.0, [M/H]=-4.0 (black) and a spectrum for the same effective temperature and surface gravity but applying the abundances of Frebel et al. (2008) (red).\nthe average, the abundances are comparable to [M/H]<-4.0 for a\nplain scaling of the solar abundances, but the relative abundances\nhave changed noticeably. Most important are the elements C, N\nand O which are highly abundant compared to higher order elements and, therefore, resemble [M/H]\u2248-2.0. All this strongly influences the chemical equilibrium in the atmosphere. Especially,\nthe carbon/oxygen ratio of the given abundance data set has\nchanged to a degree that the chemistry is almost tipped to a carbon dominated chemistry ([C/O] \u2248 1.0). Much of the carbon is\nalready bound in methane because of the increased gas density,\nfreeing up a large amount of oxygen. For this reason, strong water bands are present in the near infrared (Fig. 12). The amount\nof dust within this atmosphere is of the same order of magnitude as we find it for [M/H]\u2248-4.0...-4.5 by simple scaling of the\nsolar abundances. Merely, some details of the radial dust cloud\nstructure are washed out but are still present. However, the early\nuniverse abundances feature significantly less iron. Hence, the\nmean opacity of the dust grains is strongly reduced as much less\niron condenses. In general, the overall dust cloud characteristics\nas described in Sect. 4 remain.\nWe have shown that the dust cloud is very resistant against\nvariations of individual abundances, while the spectra can sensitively reflect such abundance variations. That is especially true\nfor the radical change in the relative abundances reported by\nFrebel et al. (2008) which reflect the influence of individual supernovae in the early universe. The richness of C, N and O yields\nlarge amounts of CO, H2 O, CH4 and N2 . Of them, especially the\nH2 O leaves strong marks in the near infrared at 1.15, 1.4 and\n1.8\u03bcm. The much weaker dust opacity due to the weaker iron\ncontribution permits a deeper view into the atmosphere which,\ncombined with slightly higher alkali abundances, results in significantly stronger alkali lines, involving a redistribution of red\noptical flux into the near infrared. In addition, the deeper look\ninto the atmosphere provides stronger TiO and FeH features\nshortwards of 1\u03bcm and slight adjustments to the near-infrared\nCIA opacity.\n\n6. Conclusions\nThe results of this paper on dust formation in low metallicity\nsubstellar objects are of interest for a variety of objects or scenarios involving dust at similarely low metalicities, like for instance\n\nMore specifically, our investigation suggests that dust clouds\nare present throughout the late M- and L-dwarf regime and into\nthe regime of hot giant gas planets. Dust is able to form even\nfor extremely low metal abundances. Only a combination of\nthese low element abundances with higher effective temperatures or very low surface gravities are able to overturn the strong\ngas phase supersaturation and thereby dissolve the dust cloud.\nTherefore, only the youngest and most massive among brown\ndwarfs and giant gas planets could resist dust formation.\nThe dust clouds in our models are shifted inwards for decreasing effective temperature, increasing surface gravity and\ndecreasing metallicity. This shift is responsible for the continuing strong presence of the clouds, as it yields a higher gas\ndensity, which is in parts able to compensate for the decreasing metal abundances with [M/H]. Therefore, the maximum dust\ncontent in our models does not linearly scale with the metallicity,\nbut decreases slower than might be expected.\nThe convective overshooting becomes more efficient in hot,\nlow-gravity objects and also with increasing element abundances. Hence, young, hot giant planets and brown dwarfs\nare likely to have high-altitude clouds compared to T- or Ydwarfs where the clouds disappear below visibility. Thus, dust\nclouds may turn out as a good tool to distinguish planets\nfrom substellar companion by a pronounced polarisation signal in the planetary case. Indeed the haze-like high-altitude\nclouds of our models support the observational findings of\nRichardson et al. (2007) and Pont et al. (2008) which were confirmed by Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. (2008) and Sengupta\n(2008), based on their polarimetry studies.\nThe gas phase at the dust clouds is typically strongly depleted. In all three model sequences we find a metallicity value\nfor which this depletion compared to the deep interior model\nabundances reaches a maximum. For higher and lower metallicities of the same sequence, the depletion is less strong. Because\nof the strong depletion, which is already present at the upper,\noptically thin cloud, it is risky to determine element abundances\nfrom absorption lines, as the visible abundances may not reflect\nthe deep interior value.\nWe have observed a shift of the composition of the dust\ngrains. The upper part of the dust cloud, which is dominated by\nsilicates, in particular in the case of solar-like metallicities, vanishes due to a developing temperature inversion with decreasing metallicity. This becomes more severe if the surface gravity\nis getting stronger. While dust grains at the bottom of the dust\ncloud are almost fully made of Al2 O3 [s] for abundances around\nthe solar value, a predominantly Fe[s] volume fraction is found\nin the extremely low metallicity cloud bases, i.e., for the oldest\namongst the brown dwarfs. High temperatures and surface gravities amplify this change.\nDust features are presently not distinguishable in the synthetic spectra, as the dust opacity features in the near- to midinfrared are too weak and too strongly convolved with the\n\n\f14\n\nS. Witte et al.: Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets\n\nspectral energy distribution of deeper atmosphere layers and\nmolecule bands from above the dust cloud. However, the spectral dust features are extremely reliant on the lattice structure of\nindividual dust grains. Unfortunately, no present dust model is\nable to properly treat this issue. Despite the lack of directly observable features, the dust clouds remain sufficiently dense to affect the near- and mid-infrared spectra even below [M/H]=-2.5.\nAdjustments to the code, in order to improve our fitting results,\nlike the adaption of a new EOS routine are almost complete.\nSubsequently, a new model grid will be produced and be available for public use.\nAcknowledgements.
