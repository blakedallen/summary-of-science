Usually, once the\n\u2217\n\npotential-density pair (PDP) is formulated as a model for a\ngalaxy, the next step is to find the corresponding distribution\nfunction (DF). This is one of the fundamental quantities in\ngalactic dynamics specifying the distribution of the stars in\n\nCorrespondence: G. A.

Although the DF\ncan generally not be measured directly, there are some observationally accesible quantities that are closed related to the DF:\nthe projected density and the line-of-sight velocity, provided\nby photometric and kinematic observations, are examples of\nDF moments. Thus, the formulation of a PDP with its corresponding equilibrium DFs establish a self-consistent stellar\nmodel that can be corroborated by astronomical observations.\nOn the other hand, a fact that is usually assumed in astrophysics, see Binney and Tremaine (2008), is that the main\npart of the mass of a typical spiral galaxy is concentrated in\na thin disk. Accordingly, the study of the gravitational potential generated by an idealized thin disk is a problem of great\nastrophysical relevance and so, through the years, different approaches has been used to obtain the PDP for such kind of thin\ndisk models (see Kuzmin (1956) and Toomre (1963, 1964),\nas examples).\nNow, a simple method to obtain the PDP of thin disks of finite\nradius was developed by Hunter (1963), the simplest example\nof disk obtained by this method being the Kalnajs (1972) disk.\nIn Gonz\u00e1lez and Reina (2006), we use the Hunter method\nin order to obtain an infinite family of axially symmetric finite thin disks, characterized by a well-behaved surface density,\nwhose first member is precisely the well-known Kalnajs disk.\nAlso, the motion of test particles in the gravitational fields generated by the first four members of this family was studied in\nRamos-Caro, L\u00f3pez-Suspez and Gonz\u00e1lez (2008), and a\nnew infinite family of self-consistent models was obtained in\nPedraza, Ramos-Caro and Gonz\u00e1lez (2008) as a superposition of members belonging to the family.\nWe will consider at the present paper the derivation of some\ntwo-integral DFs for the first four members of the family obtained in Gonz\u00e1lez and Reina (2006). Now, as is stated by\nthe Jeans theorem, an equilibrium DF is a function of the isolating integrals of motion that are conserved in each orbit and,\nas it has been shown, it is possible to find such kind of DFs for\nPDPs such that there is a certain relationship between the mass\ndensity and the gravitational potential. The simplest case of\nphysical interest corresponds to spherically symmetric PDPs,\nwhich are described by isotropic DFs that depends on the total\nenergy E. Indeed, as was be shown in Eddington (1916), it is\npossible to obtain this kind of isotropic DFs by first expressing\nthe density as a function of the potential and then solving an\nAbel integral equation.\nJiang and Ossipkov (2007) found that a similar procedure\ncan be performed in the axially symmetric case, where the\n\n2\n\nequilibrium DF depends on the energy E and the angular momentum about the axis of symmetry Lz , i.e. the two classical\nintegrals of motion. They developed a formalism that essentially combines both the Eddington formulae and the Fricke\n(1952) expansion in order to obtain the DF even part, starting\nfrom a density that can be expressed as a function of the radial coordinate and the gravitational potential. Once such even\npart is determined, the DF odd part can be obtained by introducing some reasonable assumptions about the mean circular\nvelocity or using the maximum entropy principle.\nOn the other hand, another method appropriated to find DFs\ndepending only of the Jacobi integral, Er = E \u2212 \u03a9Lz , for axially symmetric flat galaxy models was introduced by Kalnajs\n(1976) for the case of disk-like systems and basically consists\nin to express the DF as a derivative of the surface mass density with respect to the gravitational potential. Such method\ndoes not demands solving an integral equation, but instead is\nnecessary properly to express the mass density as a function of\nthe gravitational potential, a procedure that is only possible in\nsome cases.\nIn this paper we will use both of the mentioned approaches in\norder to obtain equilibrium DFs for some generalized Kalnajs\ndisks. Accordingly, the paper is organized as follows. First,\nwe present the fundamental aspects of the two methods that\nwe will use in order to obtain the equilibrium DFs. Then,\nwe present a summary of the main aspects of the generalized\nKalnajs disks, and then we derive the DFs for the first four\nmembers of the family. Finally, we summarize our main results.\n\nFormulation of the Methods\nWe assume that \u03a6 and E are, respectively, the gravitational\npotential and the energy of a star in a stellar system. One\ncan choose a constant \u03a60 such that the system has only\nstars of energy E < \u03a60 , and then define a relative potential \u03a8 = \u2212\u03a6 + \u03a60 and a relative energy \u03b5 = \u2212E + \u03a60 , see\nBinney and Tremaine (2008), such that \u03b5 = 0 is the energy\nof escape from the system. Both the mass density \u03c1(r) and the\nDF f (r, v) are related to \u03a8(r) through the Poisson equation\nZ\n\u22072 \u03a8 = \u22124\u03c0G\u03c1 = \u22124\u03c0G f d3 v,\n(1)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nFor the case of an axially symmetric system, it is customary to\nuse cylindrical polar coordinates (R, \u03c6, z), where v is denoted\nby v = (vR , v\u03c6 , vz ). As it is well known, such system admits\n\n\fRev. Acad. Colomb. Cienc. Ex. Fis. Nat. nn(nnn):ww\u2013zzz,ddd-ddd de 2016\n\ntwo isolating integrals for any orbit: the component of the angular momentum about thez-axis, Lz = Rv\u03c6 , and the relative\nenergy \u03b5. Hence, by the Jeans theorem, the DF of a steadystate stellar system in an axially symmetric potential can be\nexpressed as a non-negative function of \u03b5 and Lz , denoted by\nf (\u03b5, Lz ). Such DF, that vanishes for \u03b5 < 0, is related to the\nmass density through eq. (1).\nIn this subject, f (\u03b5, Lz ) is usually separated into even and odd\nparts, f+ (\u03b5, Lz ) and f\u2212 (\u03b5, Lz ) respectively, with respect to the\nangular momentum Lz , where\nf+ (\u03b5, Lz ) = 21 [f (\u03b5, Lz ) + f (\u03b5, \u2212Lz )],\n\n(2)\n\nf\u2212 (\u03b5, Lz ) = 12 [f (\u03b5, Lz ) \u2212 f (\u03b5, \u2212Lz )].\n\n(3)\n\n2\n2\n\u03b5 = \u03a8 \u2212 12 (vR\n+ v\u03c6\n+ vz2 ),\n\n(4)\n\nand\nSo, by using\n\nthe integral given by (1) can be expressed,\nBinney and Tremaine (2008), as\nZ Z \u221a\n4\u03c0 \u03a8 R 2(\u03a8\u2212\u03b5)\n\u03c1=\nf+ (\u03b5, Lz )dLz d\u03b5.\nR 0 0\n\nsee\n\n(5)\n\nThis integral equation was first found by Lynden-Bell (1962)\nand then applied by Evans (1993) into calculating the odd DF\nfor the Binney model, under the assumption of hv\u03c6 i having\nsome realistic rotational laws.\nAs hv\u03c6 i is not known, we cannot compute f\u2212 (\u03b5, Lz ) directly\nby eq. (6) but what we can do is to obtain the most probable distribution functions under some suitable assumptions.\nOnce f+ (\u03b5, Lz ) is known, f\u2212 (\u03b5, Lz ), and therefore f (\u03b5, Lz ), can\nbe obtained by means of the maximum entropy principle, see\nDejonghe (1986), and we obtain\ne\u03b1Lz \u2212 1\n,\ne\u03b1Lz + 1\n\n(7)\n\n2f+ (\u03b5, Lz )\n,\n(8)\n1 + e\u2212\u03b1Lz\nwhere \u03b1 is the parameter depending on the total angular\nmomentum. Obviously, |f\u2212 (\u03b5, Lz )| \u2264 f+ (\u03b5, Lz ). Also, the\nsystem is non-rotating when \u03b1 = 0 and maximally rotating as \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, i.e., for \u03b1 \u2192 +\u221e, it is anticlockwise and\nf (\u03b5, Lz ) = [1 + sign(Lz )]f+ (\u03b5, Lz ), for \u03b1 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the rotation is\nclockwise and f (\u03b5, Lz ) = [1 \u2212 sign(Lz )]f+ (\u03b5, Lz ).

In Gonz\u00e1lez and Reina\n(2006), we obtain an infinite family of axially symmetric finite\nthin disks such that the mass surface density of each model\n(labeled with the positive integer m \u2265 1) is given by\n\u0015m\u22121/2\n\u0014\nR2\n,\n(14)\n1\n\u2212\n\u03a3m (R) = \u03a3(m)\nc\na2\n(m)\n\nwith the constants \u03a3c\n\nDFs for the m = 1 disk. Given the mass surface distribution (14) and the relative potential (18a), we can easily obtain\nthe following relation:\n\u221a (1)\n2\u03a3c\n1/2\n\u03a31 (\u03a81 ) =\n(19)\n\u03a81 ,\n\u03a90 a\nwhere \u03a90 = [3\u03c0GM/(4a3 )]1/2 .

(11) with n = 0, which is equivalent to calculate the Fricke component of (20), we obtain the\neven part of a DF which depends only on the relative energy\n\nn=0\n\nwhere P2n (\u03b7) and q2n (\u03be) = i\nQ2n (i\u03be) are the usual Legendre polynomials and the Legendre functions of the second\nkind respectively, and C2n are constants given by\n\n\u03c0\u03a3c\n\u03a81 .\n\u03a90 a\n\n\u03a3c\n\u221a .\n2\u03c0\u03a90 a 2\u03b5\n\n(21)\n\nAt this point, we may notice that this f1+ (\u03b5) corresponds to\nthe DF formulated by Binney and Tremaine (2008) when\n\u03a9 = 0. (Note that there is a difference of constants as a result\nof a different definition of the relative potential and relative\nenergy.)\nTo obtain a full DF, we use the maximum entropy principle by\nmeans of eq.

As it is shown in the\nfigures, \u03b1 determines a particular rotational state in the stellar\nsystem (from here on we set G = a = M = 1 in order to generate the graphics, without loss of generality). As \u03b1 increases,\nthe probability to find a star with positive Lz increases as well.\nA similar result can be obtained for \u03b1 < 0, when the probability to find a star with negative Lz decreases as \u03b1 decreases, and\nthe corresponding plots would be analogous to figure 1, after a\nreflection about Lz = 0.\nWe can generalize this result if we perform the analysis in a rotating frame. At first instance, it is necessary to deal with the\neffective potential in order to take into account the fictitious\nforces. Choosing conveniently \u03a60r , the relative potential in the\nrotating frame takes the form\n\u03a81r (R) =\n\n(\u03a920 \u2212 \u03a92 ) 2\n(a \u2212 R2 ),\n2\n\n(23)\n\n\fRev. Acad. Colomb.

Such two-integral DFs were\nobtained, esentially, by expresing them as functionals of the Jacobi integral, as it was sketched in the formalism developed by\nKalnajs (1976). Now, since such formalism demands that the\nsurface mass density can be written as a potential-dependent\nfunction, the above procedure can only be implemented for the\nfirst four members of the family, the disks with m = 1, 2, 3, 4.\nIndeed, the procedure requires that the expression given the\nrelative potential \u03a8r as a function of the spheroidal variable\n\u03b7 can be analytically inverted in order to express the surface\nmass density \u03a3 as a function of the relative potential. So, we\ncan do this in a simple way for the disks with m = 1 to 4.\nHowever, when m > 4 we must to solve an equation of grade\nlarger than four, whose analytical solution do not exists.\n\nBinney, J. and Tremaine, S.

This procedure was also used for\nthe other three disks, starting from the Kalnajs (1976)\nmethod, so defining another class of two-integral DFs. Such\nkind of DFs describes stellar systems with a preferred rotational state, characterized by the parameter \u03b1. This paper can be considered as a natural complement of the work\npreviously presented by Gonz\u00e1lez and Reina (2006) and\nRamos-Caro, L\u00f3pez-Suspez and Gonz\u00e1lez (2008), where\nthe PDP formulation and the kinematics, respectively, of the\ndisks were analyzed. Now, by the construction of the corresponding two-integral DFs, the first four members of this family can be considered as a set of self-consistent stellar models\nfor axially symmetric galaxies.\nAcknowledgments.
