It has the\nremarkable and essentially defining property that a noncommutative gauge transformation in one field results in a gauge transformation in the mapped field, therefore\npreserving gauge-invariant observables. This map can, in principle, be used to map\na noncommutative gauge theory to a commutative one, although the action will in\ngeneral become nonlocal. As such, it has been extensively studied [2]-[22]\nThe differential form of the map, relating gauge theories at infinitesimally differing noncommutativity parameters \u03b8, defines the Seiberg-Witten equation. This\nequation has a non-covariant form. Important steps in the identification of its solutions were done by Liu [6] and especially by Okawa and Ooguri [10], by identifying\nthe gauge-invariant abelian commutative field strength produced by the map at\n\u03b8 = 0. (Similar results were also obtained in [11], [12].) The response of this map\nunder nontrivial gauge transformations, however, remains obscure. As an example,\nit was shown by Grandi and Silva [4] that the 3-dimensional Chern-Simons action\nremains invariant under the map. On the other hand, noncommutative gauge theory in odd dimensions exhibits topologically nontrivial gauge transformations which\nimply a level quantization of the Chern-Simons action even in the U(1) case [23, 24].\nIn [23], in particular, such a transformation was explicitly demonstrated. Since\ncommutative U(1) transformations are trivial, the Seiberg-Witten map must fail for\nsuch cases.\nNoncommutative gauge theory is usually formulated in terms of star-products.\nA different and quite effective formulation is the operator language [25, 26], in which\ncovariant derivatives in the noncommutative directions become operators acting\non a Heisenberg-like Hilbert space. Gauge transformations simply become unitary\nconjugations of these operators. Any operator written entirely in terms of covariant\nderivatives is explicitly gauge covariant. Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons actions can\nbe compactly written in this language in a universal way for any U(N) gauge group\n[27, 28].\nThe Seiberg-Witten map is usually written in terms of ordinary commutative\nfunctions in the star-product formulation. It is more convenient for our purposes\nto use the operator form of the map. Topologically nontrivial gauge configurations\n(solitons) or gauge transformations are easily written in the operator language and\nare, thus, amenable to explicit analysis.\n\n2\n\nThe operator map\n\nThe operator form of the Seiberg-Witten map for a fully noncommutative space\nwas derived by Kraus and Shigemori [16]. In the form presented there, however, it\ninduced a non-unitary gauge transformation spoiling the hermiticity properties of\nthe fields. For completeness, we give here a derivation suited to our purposes.\n2\n\n\fWe consider a D-dimensional space with 2n noncommutative coordinates satisfying\n[x\u03b1 , x\u03b2 ] = i\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2\n(1)\nand D \u2212 2n commutative ones. We will use middle greek indices for the full space\n(\u03bc, \u03bd, . . . = 1, . . . D), early greek indices for the purely noncommutative dimensions\n(\u03b1, \u03b2, . . . = 1, . . . 2n) and latin indices for the commutative dimensions (i, j, . . . =\n2n + 1, . . . D). We consider U(N) gauge theory, in which case the gauge fields A\u03bc\nare N \u00d7 N hermitian matrices. The Seiberg-Witten equation for the change of the\ncomponents of the gauge field A\u03bc under a small change in the (constant, c-number)\nnoncommutativity tensor \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 reads\n1\n\u03b4A\u03bc = \u2212 \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 {A\u03b1 , \u2202\u03b2 A\u03bc + F\u03b2\u03bc }\n4\n\n(2)\n\nIn the above, { , } denotes anticommutator and all matrix multiplications are understood to involve \u2217-products of the matrix elements defined in terms of \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 . with\nthe field strength defined as\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 i[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]\n\n(3)\n\nFrom (2) the change of F\u03bc\u03bd and of the gauge transformation parameter \u03bb can be\ndeduced.\nIn the operator formulation, we work with the covariant derivative operators\nD\u03bc = i\u2202\u03bc + A\u03bc . For the commutative dimensions, Di is a bona-fide differential\noperator. For the noncommutative dimensions, on the other hand, derivatives can\nbe realized via the adjoint action of coordinates themselves. We define the operators\ni\u2202\u03b1 = \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 x\u03b2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 is the two-form inverse to \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 :\n\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b8\u03b2\u03b3 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b3\n\n(5)\n\n[i\u2202\u03b1 , x\u03b2 ] = i\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(6)\n\nThe above operators satisfy\nand thus act as derivatives upon commutation. The noncommutative covariant\nderivatives D\u03b1 become operators acting on the same space as the x\u03b1 :\nD\u03b1 = i\u2202\u03b1 + A\u03b1 = \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 x\u03b2 + A\u03b1\n\n(7)\n\nand can be considered as the fundamental dynamical objects. The separation of D\u03b1\ninto derivative and gauge potential is gauge-dependent and can be changed by a\ngauge transformation, understood as a conjugation of all D\u03bc by an (xi -dependent)\nunitary operator. Due to the nontrivial commutator of [\u2202\u03b1 , \u2202\u03b2 ] (viewed as ordinary\noperators rather than through their adjoint action), the gauge field strength becomes\niF\u03b1\u03b2 = [D\u03b1 , D\u03b2 ] + i\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2\n3\n\n(8)\n\n\fThe operators x\u03b1 are, essentially, a set of n canonical pairs. Their irreducible representation consists of n copies of the quantum mechanical Heisenberg-Fock space.\nBy considering, instead, the direct sum of N copies of the irreducible representation\nwe can include the U(N) part in the operator structure. Labeling the copies with\nan extra index a = 1, . . . N, x\u03b1 and \u2202\u03b1 act trivially on a while the operator D\u03b1\nbecomes an N \u00d7 N operator matrix in this space. Thus, we can deal both with U(1)\nand U(N) gauge theories in the operator language without explicitly modifying the\nformalism.\nIn deriving the response of D\u03bc under a change of \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 it is important to realize\nthat the operators x\u03b1 are, themselves, \u03b8-dependent and they also respond to the\nchange. To make this explicit, consider the case of two noncommutative dimensions\nx1,2 with \u03b812 = \u03b8. The coordinates can be realized in terms of a canonical pair\n[q 1 , q 2 ] = i as\n\u221a\nx\u03b1 = \u03b8q \u03b1\n(9)\nThe mapping from an operator f\u02c6 to a commutative function f , such as the gauge\nfields appearing in (2), is through the Weyl ordering procedure, written explicitly\nin terms of the Fourier transform of f , f \u0303(k)\nf\u02c6 =\n\nZ\n\n~\nd k f \u0303(k)eik*~x =\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 k f \u0303(k)ei\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b8~k*~\nq\n\n(10)\n\nFor a small variation of \u03b8 we have\n\u221a\ni\n~\nd2 k f \u0303(k)~k * ~qei \u03b8k*~q\n+ \u03b4\u03b8 \u221a\n2 \u03b8\nZ\n\u221a\ni\n~\n2\ni\n\u03b8\nk*~\nq\n=\nd k\u03b4 f \u0303(k)e\n+ \u03b4\u03b8 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 q \u03b1 [q \u03b2 , f\u02c6]\n2\u03b8\n\n\u03b4 f\u02c6 =\n\nZ\n\nd k\u03b4 f \u0303(k)ei\n2\n\n\u221a\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8~k*~\nq\n\n(11)\n\nIn the above, the first term is due to the change of the commutative function f\nitself, and will be denoted \u03b4f f\u02c6, while the second term is due to the change of the\ncoordinates. This can easily be generalized to 2n dimensions as\ni\n\u03b4 f\u02c6 = \u03b4f f\u02c6 + \u03b4\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 x\u03b1 [x\u03b2 , f\u02c6]\n2\n\n(12)\n\nexpressed in terms of the variation \u03b4\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c9\u03b1\u03b3 \u03c9\u03b2\u03b4 \u03b4\u03b8\u03b3\u03b4 . The Seiberg-Witten transformation expresses only the variation of the commutative functions A\u03bc ; to find the\nvariation of the operators A\u03bc or D\u03bc the second term above must be included.\nWe now have all the ingredients. Expressing \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd and F\u03bc\u03bd in (2) in terms of their\noperator expressions and taking into account (12) we obtain, after some algebra,\ni\n\u03b4D\u03bc = \u2212\u03c9\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4\u03b8\u03bd\u03c1 D\u03c1 + \u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 {D\u03b1 , [D\u03b2 , D\u03bc ]} + i[\u03b4G, D\u03bc ]\n4\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the infinitesimal operator \u03b4G is given by\n1\n\u03b4G = \u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 {i\u2202\u03b1 , D\u03b2 }\n4\n4\n\n(14)\n\n\fWe observe that the above transformation contains a covariant piece, involving\nonly D\u03bc , plus a non-covariant piece involving also \u2202\u03b1 . This last piece, however,\namounts to a gauge transformation. We can redefine the map to include any gauge\ntransformation we want, and therefore we may discard that piece, to obtain an\nexplicitly covariant form of the equation. In fact, it is somewhat neater to express\nit in terms of the covariant coordinate operators\nX \u03b1 = \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 D\u03b2\n\n(15)\n\nand the remaining covariant derivatives in the commutative directions Dj .

If instead of X \u03b1 , X \u03b2 in the above we substitute\nx\u03b1 , x\u03b2 then (16,17) become identical to the second term in (12). The above equations, therefore, are a covariant version of the change of the corresponding operators\ndue to the change of the 'scale' of its underlying space variables.\nThe above formula for X \u03b3 can also be rewritten in the form\n1\n\u03b4X \u03b3 = \u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 [{F\u03b1\u03b2 , X \u03b3 } + 2\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 X \u03b3 \u2212 2iD\u03b1 X \u03b3 D\u03b2 ]\n(18)\n4\nThis also provides an immediate generalization of the operator transformations for\nany fields that transform in the adjoint, fundamental or antifundamental representation of the gauge group. On such fields, denoted A, f and f\u0304, the gauge transformation\nU acts on both sides, to the left only, or to the right only, respectively. Therefore,\nwe simply substitute the covariant X \u03b1 or D\u03b1 by ordinary x\u03b1 and \u2202\u03b1 on the side of\nthe operator field where U does not act. We have\n1\n\u03b4A = \u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 [{F\u03b1\u03b2 , A} + 2\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 A \u2212 2iD\u03b1 A D\u03b2 ]\n4\n1\n\u03b4f = \u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 [F\u03b1\u03b2 f + 2\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 f + 2D\u03b1 f \u2202\u03b2 ]\n4\ni\n1 \u03b1\u03b2 h\n\u03b4 f\u0304 = \u03b4\u03b8\nf\u0304F\u03b1\u03b2 + 2\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 f\u0304 + 2\u2202\u03b1 f\u0304 D\u03b2\n4\n\n3\n\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n\nThe commutative limit and the role of the gauge\ntransformation\n\nThe gauge variation connecting the covariant equations (16,17) to the original SeibergWitten equations assumes the form\n1\n\u03b4G = \u03b4\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 {x\u03b1 , X \u03b2 }\n4\n5\n\n(22)\n\n\fWe observe that for X \u03b1 = x\u03b1 , the variation \u03b4G vanishes and thus for X \u03b1 close to x\u03b1\nthe above transformation will remain small. As X \u03b1 becomes increasingly different\nthan x\u03b1 , however, \u03b4G becomes more important. Its action is to tend to 'realign' X \u03bc\nand x\u03bc as close as possible.\nThis is relevant to the commutative limit. For every nonzero \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 the mapping\nfrom \u03b8 to \u03b8 + \u03b4\u03b8 is smooth. In fact, for the covariant equations, operator gauge\ntransformations are mapped trivially without any dependence on the fields:\nU(\u03b8 + \u03b4\u03b8) = U(\u03b8)\n\n(23)\n\nin contrast to the original equations. There is no cocycle. The limit \u03b8 \u2192 0, on\nthe other hand, could be singular. For the operators X \u03b1 , or D\u03b1 , to correspond to\nsmooth finite gauge potentials in this limit they must have the scaling\nX \u03b1 = x\u03b1 + \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 A\u03b2 (x) + O(\u03b82 ) ,\n\niD\u03b1 = \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 x\u03b2 + A\u03b1 (x) + O(\u03b8)\n\n(24)\n\nwhere A\u03bc (x) is a smooth function of the x\u03bc not explicitly depending on \u03b8. To make\nthe scaling more explicit, we use \u03b8-independent Darboux operators (canonical pairs)\nq\u03b1 satisfying\n[q\u03b1 , q\u03b2 ] = i\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\n(25)\nwith \u01eb2k\u22121,2k = \u2212\u01eb2k,2k\u22121 = 1, else zero, and write\nx\u03b1 =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\nq\u03b2\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the 'square root of theta' matrix satisfies\n\u221a\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b1\u03b3 \u221a \u03b2\u03b4\n\n\u03b8 \u01eb\u03b3\u03b4 = \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(27)\n\nThen the scaling at the limit \u03b8 \u2192 0 should be\nX\u03b1 =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u221a\n\u221a 3\nq\u03b2 + \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 A\u03b2 ( \u03b8 q) + O( \u03b8 )\n\n(28)\n\nThe role of \u03b4G is to ensure, bar other obstructions, that the above relations are\nsatisfied. Indeed, we can check that the fully covariant equations (16) do not admit\n(28) as a solution to order \u03b83/2 , while the full equations (13), including \u03b4G, are\nsatisfied by (28).\nWe are therefore led to defining a class of admissible gauge transformations \u03b4G,\nto accompany the covariant equations (17,16), having the property that they admit\n(28) as a solution and therefore leading to a smooth commutative limit. The original\nSeiberg-Witten gauge (14) or (22) is such a gauge, but it is by no means unique.\nWe shall give an example of an alternative gauge in a subsequent section.\nAlternatively, we could simply solve the covariant equations and a posteriori\n'rehabilitate' the solution by performing an appropriate gauge transformation. If\nsuch a transformation can be found which ensures that (28) is satisfied, we will\n6\n\n\fhave a smooth commutative limit. Such a transformation, however, will in general\ndepend on the specific form of the field. Therefore, the mapping between gauge\ntransformations will involve a dependence on the field, recovering a cocycle [2, 21].\nThe mapping to the commutative case is essentially a reduction. The noncommutative gauge groups are always isomorphic and the mapping is trivial. In the\ncommutative limit, however, we have a reduction similar to the reduction of, say,\nSO(3) to the planar Euclidean group. It is known that a specific choice of basis\nmust be made in the representations of the original group in order to obtain representations of the reduced group. The admissible gauge transformation does just\nthat.\nWe conclude by warning that an admissible gauge transformation admits (28)\nas solutions but does not a priori guarantee that such a form will be reached at\nthe commutative limit. This is the source of the change of topology between the\nnoncommutative and commutative cases, and will be the subject of the next section.\n\n4\n\nTopologically nontrivial gauge transformations\n\nThe Chern-Simons action is invariant under an infinitesimal Seiberg-Witten transformation [4]. If the transformation worked all the way to the limit \u03b8 \u2192 0, then\nwe would obtain a mapping between the commutative and noncommutative theory\npreserving the action.\nOn the other hand, odd-dimensional noncommutative gauge theory exhibits\ntopologically nontrivial gauge transformations, even in the U(1) case, due to which\nthe coefficient of the Chern-Simons action must be quantized [23]. Since there are no\nsuch nontrivial transformations in the commutative U(1) case, the mapping between\nthe theories must fail.\nIn this section we shall examine the Seiberg-Witten mapping of topologically\nnontrivial gauge transformations and demonstrate their singularity as \u03b8 vanishes,\nthereby resolving the issue.\nWe consider a noncommutative plane with a commutative third direction, that\nis, D = 3, n = 1, \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b8\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 . The topology of gauge transformations is classified by\nthe group\n\u03c01 (U(N)) = Z\n(29)\nwhere N is any integer, corresponding to a finite truncation (regularization) of the\nHilbert space of the Heisenberg algebra defined by x1 , x2 . Gauge transformations\nare classified according to their winding number w \u2208 Z. The 'prototype' gauge\ntransformation with winding number w = 1 is\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nUo = 1 + ei\u03c6o (t) \u2212 1 |0ih0| ,\n\n\u03c6o (+\u221e) \u2212 \u03c6o (\u2212\u221e) = 2\u03c0\n\n(30)\n\nwhere t = x3 and |0i is any state in the Hilbert space, taken above to be the 'vacuum'\nof the oscillator operator x1 + ix2 . U is unitary and well-defined for any \u03b8, although\nit maps to a singular commutative field in the limit \u03b8 \u2192 0.\n7\n\n\fWe shall take the gauge field to be a nontrivial gauge transformation of the\ntrivial vacuum A\u03bc = 0, that is,\nD\u03bc = Uo\u22121 i\u2202\u03bc Uo\n\n(31)\n\nand shall evaluate the Seiberg-Witten mapping of the above field for varying \u03b8. This\nwill remain a (\u03b8-dependent) gauge transformation of the vacuum for all values of\n\u03b8. Indeed, if D\u03bc (\u03b8) is a solution of the Seiberg-Witten transformation, then so is\nU(\u03b8)D\u03bc (\u03b8)U(\u03b8) provided that U(\u03b8) satisfies\niU \u22121 \u03b4U = \u03b4G(U \u22121 DU) \u2212 \u03b4G(D)\n\n(32)\n\nHere \u03b4G(D) is either the standard Seiberg-Witten gauge transformation (14) or any\nother admissible gauge transformation. The trivial vacuum A\u03bc = 0 is always a\nsolution of the equations (with \u03b4G = 0). Therefore if U(\u03b8) satisfies (32) above and\nthe initial condition U(\u03b8o ) = Uo , then it will provide a solution of the equations\nmapping Uo to U(\u03b8).\nIt is convenient to switch to oscillator variables. Define\na=\n\nx1 + ix2\n\u221a\n,\n2\u03b8\n\n[a, a\u2020 ] = 1\n\n(33)\n\nThe corresponding covariant coordinates are\nZ=\n\nX 1 + iX 2\n\u221a\n= U \u22121 aU\n2\u03b8\n\n(34)\n\nThe gauge transformation (22) in this case becomes\n\u0011\ni\n\u03b4\u03b8 \u0010 \u2020\ni\u03b4G = \u03b4\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 {x\u03b1 , X \u03b2 } =\n{a , Z} \u2212 {a, Z \u2020 }\n4\n4\u03b8\n\n(35)\n\nInstead, we shall use the alternative gauge\ni\u03b4G\u2032 = i\u03b4G +\n\n\u0011\n\u03b4\u03b8\n\u03b4\u03b8 \u0010 1 1\n[x , X ] + [x2 , X 2] = (a\u2020 Z \u2212 Z \u2020 a)\n4\u03b8\n2\u03b8\n\n(36)\n\nIt is important to stress that the above modified transformation is still admissible,\nas can be directly verified by the fact that it admits (28) as a solution. This is\nsimpler than (35) and we shall use it for our calculation.\nDue to the rotational symmetry of the vacuum configuration and of the original\ntransformation Uo , we shall choose U(\u03b8) to also be rotationally symmetric; that is,\nU(\u03b8) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nei\u03c6n |nihn|\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u03c6n are \u03b8-dependent phases and |ni are a-oscillator states. Equation (32) for\nU, then, with \u03b4G\u2032 above as the gauge transformation, becomes\n\u03b4\u03c6n =\n\n\u03b4\u03b8\nn sin(\u03c6n \u2212 \u03c6n\u22121 )\n\u03b8\n8\n\n(38)\n\n\fIn the limit \u03b8 \u2192 0, \u03c6n and \u03c6n\u22121 become almost equal and thus we can approximate\nsin(\u03c6n \u2212 \u03c6n\u22121 ) \u2243 \u2202\u03c6n /\u2202n. The above equation in that limit becomes\n!\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03c6n = 0\n\u2212\n\u2202 ln \u03b8 \u2202 ln n\nDefining the (positive) variable r =\n\n\u221a\n\n(39)\n\n2n\u03b8, the above equation admits as solution\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(r)\n\n(40)\n\nSince r 2 are the eigenvalues of the operator 2\u03b8a\u2020 a = (x1 )2 + (x2 )2 + \u03b8, the above\nsimply expresses the fact that in the commutative limit \u03c6 becomes a smooth function\nof the radial coordinate, thus reconfirming the admissibility of the chosen gauge and\nthe rotational symmetry of the configuration.\nTo derive the shape of \u03c6(r) as \u03b8 \u2192 0, we first note that \u03b4\u03c60 = 0, and thus\n\u03c6(r = 0) = \u03c6o (t). Further, we note that the values \u03c6n = 0, \u03c0 are fixed points at\nwhich \u03b4\u03c6n = 0. Since the initial condition is \u03c60 = \u03c6o , \u03c6n = 0 (n > 0), we conclude\nthat \u03c6(r = \u221e) = 0. So \u03c6(r) will interpolate between \u03c6o at the origin and 0 at\ninfinity, and the question is which way.\nTo decide that, note that for \u03c6o = \u03c0 \u2212 \u01eb, sin(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60 ) < 0 and thus, for \u03b4\u03b8/\u03b8 < 0,\n\u03c61 will increase. The rest of the \u03c6n will follow suite, and thus the interpolation will\nbe in the interval [\u03c0 \u2212 \u01eb, 0]. Conversely, for \u03c6o = \u03c0 + \u01eb \u2261 \u2212\u03c0 + \u01eb, sin(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60 ) > 0\nand thus \u03c61 and the rest of \u03c6n will decrease. In this case the interpolation will be\nin the interval [\u2212\u03c0 + \u01eb, 0]. For \u03b8o = \u03c0, \u03c6n will remain 0 (for n > 1) and thus \u03c6(r)\nwill become a single spike at the origin. The spatial spread of the function \u03c6(r) will\nkeep diminishing with decreasing \u03b8, approaching a zero-support function at \u03b8 = 0.\nWe have concluded that the topologically nontrivial gauge transformation is\nmapped by the Seiberg-Witten map to a singular abelian commutative transformation. The singularity appears as a discontinuity in time. The spatial profile is\nsmooth for all times t < to . As we approach the time t = to , in which \u03c6o (to ) = \u03c0,\nthe gauge transformation shrinks and at t = to \u2212 \u01eb it becomes a spike at r = 0 with\namplitude \u03c0. At t = to + \u01eb the amplitude of the spike becomes \u2212\u03c0 (which is gaugeequivalent to \u03c0) and for t > to we have a smooth profile again but with opposite sign.\nThe transformation is singular, producing infinite derivatives and a singular gauge\nfield. Such a gauge transformation is inadmissible in the commutative theory. Thus,\ngauge field configurations which would be related to (smooth) commutative fields by\na topologically nontrivial gauge transformation become singular and decouple from\nthe theory, leaving only trivial topology.\nThe fact that the Seiberg-Witten map can be singular is well known. For a\nconstant magnetic field B = \u03b8\u22121 , for instance, the corresponding commutative field\nis infinite [1]. What we have demonstrated above, however, is rather different: it is\na singularity which exists even for zero field strength and originates in the topology\nof the gauge transformations. We expect it to persist in all odd-dimensional spaces.\n9\n\n\f5\n\nChern-Simons invariants of the map\n\nWe conclude this note by commenting on the invariance of Chern-Simons actions\nunder the Seiberg-Witten transformation. In the operator formulation the 2n + 1dimensional noncommutative Chern-Simons action is written in form notation as\n[28]\n!\nn\nX\nn+1 k+1\nS2n+1 =\n(\u2212\u03c9)n\u2212k TrD2k+1\n(41)\nk\n+\n1\n2k\n+\n1\nk=0\n\nwhere D = dx\u03bc D\u03bc is an operator one-form corresponding to the noncommutative\ncovariant derivative and \u03c9 is the two-form \u03c9 = \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 dx\u03b1 dx\u03b2 . A variation of the above\naction yields\n!\nn\nX\nn+1\n(k + 1)(\u2212\u03c9)n\u2212k Tr(D2k \u03b4D)\n(42)\n\u03b4S2n+1 =\nk=0 k + 1\n\nWe may, now, use expression (13) for the variation \u03b4D and calculate the variation\n\u03b4S2n+1 . The gauge transformation term \u03b4G in (13) produces no variation, since\nS2n+1 is gauge invariant. Of the covariant terms in (13), the first is linear in D\u03bc and\npreserves the degree of any monomial in D\u03bc , while the second involves three covariant\nderivatives and thus increases the degree of any monomial in D\u03bc by two. The\nvariation of the highest-order term in (41) TrD2n+1 , then, under this transformation\nwill be of order 2n + 3 and cannot be canceled by any lower-dimensional term. If\nS2n+1 is to be invariant , this terms itself must vanish. Se we examine the term\n\u0010\n\nTr(D2k \u03b4D) = \u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 Tr {D\u03b1 , [D\u03b2 , D]}D2n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n= 2\u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 Tr D\u03b1 D\u03b2 D2n+1 \u2212 D\u03b1 DD\u03b2 D2n\n\n\u0011\n\n(43)\n\nwhere we used cyclicity of trace. To analyze the above further, we define the antisymmetric two-tensor \u03b4\u0398\n\u03b4\u0398 = \u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 v\u03b1 v\u03b2\n(44)\nwhere v\u03b1 are one-vectors satisfying hv\u03b1 , dx\u03b2 i = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 and all products are antisymmetric. Then the contraction h\u03b4\u0398, TrD2n+3 i takes the form\nh\u03b4\u0398, TrD2n+3 i = (2n + 3) \u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u22121)k Tr(D\u03b1 Dk D\u03b2 D2n+1\u2212k )\n\n(45)\n\nk=0\n\nWe observe that (43) is the first two terms of the above contraction.\nSince we are in 2n+ 1 dimensions, all forms with degree higher that 2n+ 1 vanish\nidentically. Therefore the above contraction, involving D2n+3 , will also vanish. The\ntransformation (43), however, differs from that by extra terms which generically do\nnot vanish. In the special case 2n + 1 = 3 only, we have\n2\n\u03b4TrD3 = h\u03b4\u0398, TrD5 i = 0\n(46)\n5\nThis is the only case in which the variation of the Chern-Simons action under a\nSeiberg-Witten transformation vanishes. For higher dimensions the invariance of\nthe action is essentially spoiled by noncommutative ordering effects.\n10\n\n\f6\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe have analyzed the topological properties of the Seiberg-Witten map. Several\nissues call for further investigation, however, and we state a few here.\nThe solution of the Seiberg-Witten map at the point \u03b8 = 0 was identified in\n[10] in terms of an abelian commutative field strength, for spaces of even dimension.\n(The extension to odd dimensions is given in [29].) This, however, bypasses all the\nissues on gauge transformations, such as the ones examined in this paper. It would\nbe desirable to have a solution in terms of gauge potentials themselves, which would\nreveal singularities of the map due to nontrivial topology. Further, the existing\nsolution holds strictly for U(1) gauge theory. The generalization to U(N) gauge\ntheory is an interesting open issue.\nOn a different front, noncommutative gauge theory describes a kind of fuzzy fluid\n[30, 29]. The Seiberg-Witten map is, then, identified as an instance of the Lagrange\nto Euler map for fluids. This could be useful to the description of quantum Hall\nstates in terms of a noncommutative Chern-Simons theory, as proposed by Susskind.\nThe generalization of the map, however, to the theory describing finite quantum\nHall droplets [31], which would be an important ingredient in this description, is\nnot known.\n\nReferences\n[1] N.
