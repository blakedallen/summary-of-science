We\nstudy the total population size for random walks which branch and annihilate\non Zd , with time-independent random rates. The random walks are independent, continuous time, rate 2d\u03ba, simple, symmetric, with \u03ba \u2265 0. A random walk\nat x \u2208 Zd , binary branches at rate v+ (x), and annihilates at rate v\u2212 (x). The\nrandom environment w has coordinates w(x) = (v\u2212 (x), v+ (x)) which are i.i.d.\nWe identify a natural way to describe the annealed-Gaussian transition mechanism under mild conditions on the rates.

Introduction\nWhen studying the long time behavior of markovian dynamics in random media,\none is faced with an important distinction: quenched vs averaged estimates. Should\none work in the so-called quenched regime, where the randomness of the medium is\nfrozen, i.e. where the dynamics are studied in one fixed random realization of the\nmedium/environment? Or should one work in the averaged regime where both the\nrandomness of the dynamics and of the medium are considered, i.e. when one studies\n\nAMS 2000 subject classifications.

A good\ngeneric class of examples where this distinction is significant is given by models of\nreaction-diffusion in random media ([GM(1990)], [GM(1998)], [S(1998)]).\nThere are two opposing views about this distinction. The first approach is to think\nthat the relevant and important asymptotic long-time estimates are the quenched\nones. But, recognizing the obvious fact that the quenched estimates are the most\nintractable ones mathematically, the averaged/annealed results are seen as a welcome\nfirst approximation. The second and opposing view is that, in many applications,\nthe averaged asymptotic estimates are the only relevant ones. The quenched results,\nthough mathematically more challenging, are not seen as useful or relevant. This\nsecond view is naturally based on the idea that some mechanism must be at work,\nwhich allows for averaging in the medium randomness.\nSome years ago, the authors of this paper held the two opposing opinions expressed\nabove, based on their former collaborations with different domains of applications\n(specifically physics of pollution by underground waste storage on the one hand and\nchemical kinetics on the other). In the recent years we have built a common answer,\nwhich we believe provides not only a natural resolution of the scientific debate, but\nalso introduces the idea that there exists in fact a very rich universal transition\nbetween the averaged and quenched results, which goes far beyond the reactiondiffusion context. This transition also explains, in our view,the true relevance of\nthese regimes in various applications.\nThe key idea is the following: one should work with a fixed realization of the\nmedium but introduce a new parameter, say L, which will be the scale of the spatial\nextent of the initial distribution of the dynamics. Then, depending on the respective\nsizes of the time scale t and the space scale L (when both t and L diverge), one should\nsee the transition we mentioned between the quenched and averaged asymptotic\nresults. More precisely one should expect the following transition: for time scales\nt(L) short enough the averaged asymptotic results should be valid, whereas for very\nlong time scales t(L) the quenched results should hold, and our new intermediate\nasymptotics should emerge in between. The mechanism of this transition is the\nfollowing: for short time scales t(L), or equivalently for large space scales L(t) for the\ninitial distribution, the spatial ergodic theorem should ensure the needed averaging\nmechanism in order to enforce the validity of averaged/annealed results. For very\nlarge time scales no averaging is possible and the extreme values of the environment\nplay the prominent role. The transition regimes are then easily understood, they\nconsist in regions of parameters t and L where one sees a gradual emergence of the\nextreme values versus the average .\n\n1\n\nThis regime is often called the annealed regime in the mathematical literature. This is an\nentrenched but misleading vocabulary since it is not the usual convention in physics\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n3\n\nThis scheme has been first established in the simplest possible context, i.e i.i.d\nsamples [BBM(2005)]. More precisely sums of exponential of i.i.d random variables\nare shown to exhibit this transition. In the context of reaction diffusion this could\nsimply be seen as reaction with no diffusion! In this simple context a full transition is given from the Gaussian asymptotics to extreme value theory: one sees in\n[BBM(2005)] the gradual emergence of the importance of extreme values of the i.i.d\nsample which gradually destroys the validity of the Central Limit Theorem and then\nof the Law of large Numbers by enforcing \u03b1-stable fluctuations where the exponent\n\u03b1 decreases through the whole possible range, i.e from 2 to 0. This mechanism is\nanalogous to the phase transition description of mean-field spin-glass equilibrium\nmodels such as the Random Energy Model ([D(1981)], [BKL(2002)]).\nWe then proceeded ([BMR(2005)]) to one important case of reaction-diffusion,\ni.e annihilation (or absorption) for random walks in a random environment, more\nprecisely random walks killed on random obstacles, building on the work of [S(1998)].\nThere, we studied the same transition mechanism for the natural quantity, which is\nthe probability of survival. Our picture was less precise than in the i.id context, in\nthe sense that even though we get the proper scales for the intermediate regimes we\ncannot establish the stable nature of the fluctuations, due to a lack of precise enough\nunderstanding of the edge of the spectrum (for the generator of the dynamics which\nis the discrete Dirichlet Laplacian on a random domain of Zd ).\nIn this paper we address a rather general case of reaction-diffusion in random\nenvironments, i.e of a system of non-interacting continuous-time Random Walks on\nthe lattice Zd branching and annihilating with stationary random rates ([GM(1990)],\n[GM(1998)]).\nLet us first describe the random environment {w(x) : x \u2208 Zd }, with w(x) :=\n(v\u2212 (x), v+ (x)) where v+ := {v+ (x) : x \u2208 Zd } represents the branching rates with\nv+ (x) \u2208 [0, \u221e), while v\u2212 := {v\u2212 (x) : x \u2208 Zd } represents the annihilation rates, with\nv\u2212 (x) \u2208 [0, \u221e] so that we admit the possibility of hard core obstacles. We assume\nthat the random variables {w(x) : x \u2208 Zd } are i.i.d and call their distribution \u03bc.\nWe consider the following dynamics in a fixed random realization of this environment. We start with one particle at each site of the box \u039bL of side L in Zd .\nEach random walk moves independently of the others according to a continuous\ntime simple symmetric rate 2d\u03ba dynamics for some \u03ba \u2265 0 (we admit the possibility that \u03ba = 0, i.e. no diffusion at all, as in [BBM(2005)]). A random walk at\na site x \u2208 Zd , branches at rate v+ (x), disappearing and producing two new independent offsprings, and annihilates at rate v\u2212 (x) (note that v\u2212 (x) = \u221e means the\nannihilation is instantaneous and certain as in [BMR(2005)]).\nWe study the asymptotic behavior, when both t and L go to infinity, of the\nfollowing observable of our system of random walkers in random environment:\n1 X\nm(x, t, w)\nmL (0, t, w) :=\n|\u039bL |\nx\u2208\u039bL\n\nNote that mL (0, t, w) is simply the (normalized) size of the total population.\nOur main result, theorem 1, describes sharp conditions on the scales of t and\nL for the validity of annealed asymptotics of mL (0, t, w) and for these annealed\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n4\n\nasymptotics to cease to be true. It also describes the scales for t and L where the\nfluctuations about these annealed asymptotics are Gaussian and when they cease\nto be so. We intend to give a full and complete picture of the expected stable\nfluctuations, all the way to quenched asymptotics, for a wide class of branching\nrates in a forthcoming work.\nThe results we obtain here are general, in the sense that they are valid for a large\nclass of product distributions for the random environment, under mild conditions on\nthe branching and annihilation rates. They include examples in the four universality\nclasses recently introduced by van den Hofstad, K\u00f6nig and M\u00f6rters [HKM(2005)]\ndescribing all the cases of the random environment. For example, potentials which\nare unbounded of Weibull type, of double exponential type, almost bounded and\nbounded of Fr\u00e9chet type. Furthermore, our results include and generalize both\ntheorems 2.1 and 2.2 of [BBM(2005)], parts (ii) and (iii) of theorem 1 and part (i)\nof theorem 2 of [BMR(2005)].\nLet us now be more precise about our assumptions about the distribution of the\nenvironment. In the recent paper [HKM(2005)], it is shown that under regularity\nassumptions on the tail of the law of the effective potential v(0) := v+ (0) \u2212 v\u2212 (0),\nexactly four universality classes of environments can occur. Their assumptions are\nformulated in terms of the cumulant generating function,\nE\nD\nH(t) = log ev(0)t ,\n\nt \u2265 0,\n\n(1)\n\nof the law of the effective\npotential v(0), where for any function of the environment\nR\nf , we define hf i := f d\u03bc. Their basic assumption is that this function is defined\nand finite for every t \u2265 0. Then, under two regularity assumptions on H they show\nthat four universality classes can occur: (1) a first class where v is unbounded and\nhas \"heavy tails\" at infinity, and which includes Weibull-type tails; (2) a second\nclass of unbounded potentials with \"lighter\" tails which includes the double exponential law; (3) a class containing bounded and unbounded potentials; (4) a class of\nbounded potentials including those which have Fr\u00e9chet-type tails near their essential\nsupremum, and the degenerate case of random walks on hard core random obstacles\nwith \u03bc[v(0) = \u2212\u221e] = p < 1. In this paper we generalize parts (ii) and (iii) of theorem 1 of [BMR(2005)] describing the passage to an annealed and Gaussian regime,\nto the previously described system of random walks on the random environment w,\nunder mild conditions which include cases in these four universality classes.\nThroughout this article the following will be assumed.\nAssumption (E). The law of the effective potential is such that \u03bc[v(0) = \u2212\u221e] < 1\nand\nE\nD\nev(0)t < \u221e,\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\nAssumption (E) ensures that \u03bc-a.s. the stochastic process of random walks on the\nrandom environment w can be constructed on infinite volume ([GM(1990)]), as a\nlimit of processes defined on finite boxes corresponding to continuous time Markov\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n5\n\nbranching processes, as defined in Athreya and Ney in [AN(1972)]. Furthermore, if\n\u03b6(t) denotes the total number of random walks at time t on a random environment\nw, given that initially there was only a single one at site x, and Exw the expectation defined by its law, condition (E) ensures the existence of the first moment\nm(x, t, w) = Exw [\u03b6(t)]. This is the content of proposition 1 of this paper. This first\nmoment will be the central object of our study. We will see that assumption\n(E) enR\nsures the finiteness for t \u2265 0 of the annealed first moments hm(0, t)i = m(0, t, w)d\u03bc,\nwith which we will state our main assumptions. We will need to define the growth\nfunctions {H1 (t) : t \u2265 0} by\nH1 (t) := loghm(0, t)i.\n(2)\nOur main assumption will be formulated with the help of a family of functions\n{F\u03b8 : \u03b8 \u2208 R} which we call the intermittency exponents, defined for every \u03b8 6= 0 and\nt \u2265 0 as,\nH1 ((1 + \u03b8)t) \u2212 (1 + \u03b8)H1 (t)\n.\n\u03b8\nAssumption (MI).

It encompasses\nexamples falling in the four universality classes of [HKM(2005)].\nWe will show that it is possible to formulate an assumption directly in terms of\nthe cumulant generating function H, which is sufficient for (MI) to be satisfied,\nand includes the first class of [HKM(2005)]. For this we need to define the cumulant\nexponents, parametrized by \u03b8 6= 0, for t \u2265 0 as,\nH((1 + \u03b8)t) \u2212 (1 + \u03b8)H(t)\n.\n(4)\n\u03b8\nBy Jensen's inequality it can be seen that G\u03b8 (t) \u2265 0 whenever 0 < |\u03b8| \u2264 1. We will\nsee that condition (MI) is satisfied whenever the following happens.\nG\u03b8 (t) :=\n\nAssumption (SI). For all |\u03b8| > 0 small enough,\nG2\u03b8 (t) \u2212 G\u03b8 (t)\n= \u221e.\nt\u2192\u221e\n\u03b8t\nlim\n\nCondition (SI) includes the first universality class of [HKM(2005)] and can be viewed\nas a strong intermittency requirement. It implies H(t)/t \u226b 1. Hence, using the\nbounds eH(t)\u22122d\u03bat \u2264 hm(0, t)i \u2264 eH(t) (see for example theorem 3.1 of G\u00e4rtner and\nMolchanov [GM(1990)]), we see that if (SI) is satisfied, we have the asymptotics\nloghm(0, t)i \u223c H(t),\n\n(5)\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n6\n\nwhich is much faster than the a.s. one (see [GM(1998)]).\nAs already mentioned the interest of the results of the present paper are their\ngenerality. Namely, their are valid only under the assumptions (E) and (MI). Part\n1\n(i) of theorem 1, states that if for some \u01eb > 0 we have L(t) \u2265 e d F\u01eb (t) eventually in\nmL\n\u223c 1 is satisfied in probability: hence we have the\nt, the law of large numbers hmi\nL\nannealed behavior log m (0, t) \u223c log hm(0, t)i. On the other hand, if for some \u01eb > 0\n1\nmL\nwe have L(t) \u2264 e d F\u2212\u01eb (t) eventually in t, in probability hmi\n\u226a 1. Part (ii) says that if\nL\n\n1\n\nd\n\nhmi\nconverges\nfor some \u01eb > 0 we have L(t) \u2265 e d F\u01eb (2t) eventually in t, then m \u2212(2L+1)\nV ar\u03bc mL\nin distribution to a centered normal law of unit variance N (0, 1), where V ar\u03bc denotes\n1\nthe variance. Also, if for some \u01eb > 0 we have L(t) \u2264 e d F\u2212\u01eb (2t) eventually in t, in\nL\nd\nhmi\nprobability m \u2212(2L+1)\n\u226a 1.

Indeed, in this case, a law of large numbers is satisfied when\nd log L(t) \u2265 \u03b3J(t) for some \u03b3 > \u03b31 ; the CLT when d log L(t) \u2265 \u03b3J(t) for some\n\u03b3 > \u03b32 . Furthermore, if d log L(t) \u2264 \u03b3J(t) for some \u03b3 < \u03b31 , the law of large numbers\nis not satisfied, while if d log L(t) \u2264 \u03b3J(t) for some \u03b3 < \u03b32 , the CLT is not satisfied. Propositions 4, 5, 6 and 7 give the explicit value of \u03b31 , \u03b32 and J in the case\nof unbounded potentials with Weibull type tails, unbounded potentials with double\nexponential type tails, potentials in the third universality class of [HKM(2005)] and\nbounded potentials with Fr\u00e9chet type tails including the pure hard core case.

This theorem, generalizes Case 3 of theorem 2 of\n[BMR(2005)].\nThe special case in which assumption (SI) is satisfied expressed as corollary 1.\nThis includes the case \u03ba = 0, corresponding to sums of i.i.d. random exponentials\nwhere condition (MI) reduces to,\nG2\u03b8 (t) \u2212 G\u03b8 (t)\n= \u221e,\n(6)\nt\u2192\u221e\n\u03b8\nfor |\u03b8| > 0 large enough, and H1 (t) = H(t). Corollary 1 is a result complementary to\ntheorem of [BBM(2005)], generalizing theorems 2.1 and 2.2 of [BBM(2005)] where\nWeibull and Fr\u00e9chet type tails are assumed on v(0).\nOne of the main ingredients of the proof of theorem 1 is a coarse graining technique, necessary to reduce the asymptotics of the averaged first moments, to a sum of\nindependent random exponentials. This technique, was introduced in [BMR(2005)],\nbut here it faces the extra difficulty that the terms of the sum defining the averaged\nprobabilities are not uniformly bounded with respect to the time variable t or the\nscale L (whereas in [BMR(2005)], such a bound existed having the value 1). This\nrequires more careful estimates on these quantities, which are performed, via the\nFeynman-Kac formula and spectral estimates. Once the reduction to a sum of i. i.\nd. exponentials is achieved, an analysis based on von Bahr-Esseen inequality finishes\nthe proof (see also [BMR(2005)] and [BBM(2005)]).\nBesides this introduction, this paper has four other sections. The main results\nare stated in section 2. We first introduce in subsection 2.1 the main definitions.\nIn subsection 2.2 we formulate proposition 1, stating that a growth of the form\n(x)\nlim sup|x|\u2192\u221e |x|v+log\n|x| = 0 is enough to ensure well defined first moments for the\ntotal number of particles. When this proposition is combined with proposition 2\nof [GM(1990)], one concludes that under the condition (E), the reaction-diffusion\nprocess on the lattice Zd is such that the total number of particles at any given\ntime has a finite first moment, for initial conditions with a finite total number of\nparticles. In particular, there is no explosion, and the process is well defined. We\nthen state theorem 1 in section 2.3. Corollary 1, under the assumption (SI) is\nstated and proved next. The applications of theorem 1 are given in subsection\n2.4. First, the regularity condition (RI), is introduced. This is applied to the case\nof unbounded effective potentials with Weibull type tails, through proposition 4,\nusing the Kasahara exponential Tauberian theorem [BGT(1989)]. Next, corollary 2\nis applied to the case of unbounded potentials with double exponentially decaying\ntype tails, through proposition 5. Then, we treat the case of potentials falling in\nthe third universality class (almost bounded) of [HKM(2005)] through proposition\n6. We end subsection 2.4 considering the case of bounded potentials with tails near\ntheir upper-bound which are of the Fr\u00e9chet type (proposition 7). In subsection\nlim\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n8\n\n2.5, we state theorem 2, which improves the upper bounds describing the order of\nmagnitude of the empirical average for the examples considered in subsection 2.4.\nThe proof of proposition 1, is the content of the third section. In section 4, the\ntruncated first moments are introduced. These are the first moments of a reactiondiffusion process defined on a finite box, with Dirichlet boundary conditions. They\nare then used to approximate some important quantities related to the averaged first\nmoments. Then, several important estimates for the moments and correlations of\nthe first moments are derived. The proof of theorems 1 and 2 are given in section\n5. In subsection 5.1, the partition analysis method of [BMR(2005)] is recalled. This\nand together with the estimates of section 4, and the von Bahr-Esseen inequality,\nis subsequently applied to prove theorem 1. The paper finishes with subsection 5.7,\nwhere theorem 2 is proved.\n2. Notation and results\nHere we will state the results of this paper. After introducing most of the notation\nand giving the main definitions in the first subsection, in subsection 2.2 we state\nproposition 8, which ensures that a.s. there is no explosion for the reaction-diffusion\nprocess under assumption (E). Then, the principal result of this paper, theorem 1,\nis stated in subsection 2.3, together with corollary 1. In subsection 2.4, we state\ncorollary 2, giving the form of theorem 1, under certain regularity assumptions.\nHere we will consider applications of this results to several specific examples of\ndistributions of the effective potential. We end the presentation of our results with\nsubsection 2.5, where we state theorem 2.\n2.1. Definition of the reaction-diffusion process. We begin defining a reactiondiffusion model corresponding to a set of random walks on the lattice Zd branching\nand annihilating at rates depending on the their position. Consider the set of natural\nd\nnumbers N endowed with the discrete topology. Define the set \u03a9 := NZ representing\nthe possible configuration of particles on the lattice. In this paper we will be interested only on the subset of configurations \u03a90 \u2282 \u03a9 characterized by the property that\n{x : \u03b7(x) > 0} has finite cardinality whenever \u03b7 \u2208 \u03a90 . Let v+ := {v+ (x) : x \u2208 Zd }\nand v\u2212 := {v\u2212 (x) : x \u2208 Zd }, where v+ (x) \u2208 [0, \u221e) and v\u2212 (x) \u2208 [0, \u221e]. Here v+ (x)\nand v\u2212 (x) represent the rate at which particles branch and annihilate at site x, respectively. Note that we admit the value \u221e for the annihilation rate: this represents\na hard core obstacle, where particles are instantly annihilated. Call an ordered pair\nw := (v\u2212 , v+ ) \u2208 W , with coordinates w(x) = (v\u2212 (x), v+ (x)), a field configuration,\nd\nwhere W := ([0, \u221e) \u00d7 [0, \u221e])Z . We will denote the set of hard core obstacle sites\nby G(w) := {x \u2208 Zd : v\u2212 (x) = \u221e}. Given r \u2208 [0, \u221e) and x \u2208 Zd we will call\n\u039b(x, r) := {y \u2208 Z : ||x \u2212 y|| \u2264 r} the ball of radius r centered at x under the norm\n||x|| := sup1\u2264i\u2264d |xi |, where xi are the coordinates of x. We will furthermore use\nthe notation \u039br in place of \u039b(0, r). In this subsection we will construct a stochastic\nprocess as the limit as L \u2192 \u221e of processes defined on the boxes \u039bL . Throughout the sequel, given a subset U \u2282 Zd , we will denote by U c the complement of\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n9\n\nU and \u03b4U := {x \u2208 U c : inf y\u2208U |x \u2212 y| = 1}, where | * | denotes the Euclidean distance. So, for each finite subset U \u2282 Z, we want to consider a process with state\nspace \u03a9w\n0 := {\u03b7 \u2208 \u03a90 : \u03b7(x) = 0 , x \u2208 G(w)} defined formally by the infinitesimal\ngenerator,\nLU f (\u03b7) :=\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03ba\u03b7(x)(f (\u03b7 x,y ) \u2212 f (\u03b7))\n\nx\u2208U \u2229G(w)c y\u2208G(w)c :||x\u2212y||=1\n\n+\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03ba\u03b7(x)(f (\u03b7 x,\u2212 ) \u2212 f (\u03b7))\n\nx\u2208U \u2229G(w)c y\u2208G(w):||x\u2212y||=1\n\n+\n\nX\n\nv+ (x)\u03b7(x)(f (\u03b7 x,+ ) \u2212 f (\u03b7))\n\nx\u2208U \u2229G(w)c\n\n+\n\nX\n\nx\u2208G(w)c\n\nv\u2212 (x)\u03b7(x)(f (\u03b7 x,\u2212 ) \u2212 f (\u03b7)),\n\n(7)\n\nacting on an appropriate dense subset DU of the space of real bounded functions\nw\nB(\u03a9w\n0 ), defined on \u03a90 , endowed with the uniform norm. In the above expression,\nx,y\n\u03ba \u2265 0, \u03b7 is the configuration where a particle from site x has jumped to site y so\nthat \u03b7 x,y (z) = \u03b7(z) if z 6= x, y, \u03b7 x,y (x) = \u03b7(x) \u2212 1, and \u03b7 x,y (y) = \u03b7(y) + 1; \u03b7 x,+ is the\nconfiguration where there is an extra particle at site x and \u03b7 x,\u2212 the configuration\nwhere one particle at site x has disappeared. It is a well known fact that it is\npossible to construct a strong Markov process, denoted by \u03b7 U := {\u03b7 U (t) : t \u2265 0},\ncorresponding to an infinitesimal generator of the form (7), and taking values on the\nSkorokhod space S := D([0, \u221e); \u03a9w\n0 ). In fact, such a process falls in the category\ncalled |U |-dimensional continuous time Markov branching process by Athreya and\nNey (see chapter V, sections 7.1-7.2 of Athreya-Ney [AN(1972)]). Furthermore, it\ncan be shown that a.s. the expected value of each coordinate of such a process\n{\u03b7 U (t) : t \u2265 0}, is finite, ensuring that there cannot be infinitely many particles\nproduced in a finite time (see section 7.1 of [AN(1972)]). Let us now call P(\u03a9w\n0)\nendowed\nwith\nthe\nBorel\n\u03c3-algebra\nthe set of probability measures defined on \u03a9w\n0\nassociated to the subspace topology of \u03a9w\n0 as a subset of \u03a9 with the product topology.\nThen, for each field configuration w \u2208 W and probability measure \u03bd \u2208 P(\u03a9w\n0 ) denote\nby P\u03bdU,w the law of the process {\u03b7 U (t) : t \u2265 0} defined on S endowed with its Borel\n\u03c3-field B(S). We will call this process the reaction-diffusion process on U with field\nw and initial condition \u03bd. In the particular case in which U = \u039bn we will use\nthe obvious notations Ln and P\u03bdn,w . Furthermore, we will call the process on \u039bn ,\nthe reaction-diffusion process at scale n. Now, note that using the natural coupling\n[Lg(1985)] and Kolmogorov's extension theorem, it is possible to define for each field\nw\nconfiguration w \u2208 W and initial condition \u03bd \u2208 P(\u03a9w\n0 ) a probability measure Q\u03bd on\nN\nthe product space S , endowed with its Borel \u03c3-algebra induced by the product\ntopology, in such a way that if \u03b7 n \u2208 S denotes the n-th coordinate of an element\nn\n\u03b7 \u2208 S N , \u03b7 n (t) \u2208 \u03a9w\n0 its value at time t \u2265 0 and \u03b7 (t, x) \u2208 N the value at time t of\nn\nthe x-coordinate of \u03b7 (t), then,\n(i) for every A \u2208 B(S) and n \u2265 1,\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n10\n\nn\nn,w\nQw\n\u03bd [\u03b7 \u2208 A] = P\u03bd [A].\nn\nIn particular, for every B \u2208 B(\u03a90 ) we have that, Qw\n\u03bd [\u03b7 (0) \u2208 B] = \u03bd[B].\n(ii) for every n \u2265 1,\nn+1\nQw\n(t) \u2265 \u03b7 n (t)] = 1.\n\u03bd [\u03b7\n(iii) for each n \u2265 1 define the first exit time from the box \u039bn as\n\nTn := inf{t \u2265 0 : sup \u03b7 n (x, t) > 0}.\nx\u2208\u039bcn\n\nThen, for every n \u2265 1,\nn\nn+1\nQw\n(t), Tn > t] = Qw\n\u03bd [\u03b7 (t) = \u03b7\n\u03bd [Tn > t].\nLet us now remark that due to property (ii), for every t \u2265 0 and x \u2208 Zd the limit,\n\n\u03b7(t, x) := lim \u03b7 n (t, x),\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nexists, possibly taking the value \u221e. Define \u03b7(t) := {\u03b7(t, x) : x \u2208 Zd }. We denote\nd\nthe stochastic process {\u03b7(t) : t \u2265 0}, taking values on the space N\u0304Z , where N\u0304 is the\nAlexandrov compactification of the natural numbers, and distributed according to\nthe measure Qw\n\u03bd , the reaction-diffusion process with field w and initial law \u03bd. We\nwill denote by E\u03bdw the corresponding expectation. In addition, for each t \u2265 0, we\ndefine the total number of particles at time t by\nX\n\u03b6(t) :=\n\u03b7(t, x).\nx\u2208Zd\n\nAlso, whenever it is true that,\nh\ni\nd\n\u03b7(x,\nt)\n<\n\u221e,\n\u2200\nx\n\u2208\nZ\n,\nt\n\u2265\n0\n= 1,\nQw\n\u03bd\n\nwe will say that with probability one there is no explosion. In the sequel we define\nfor each x \u2208 Zd the probability measure \u03b4x on (\u03a9w\n0 , B) which assigns probability 1 to\nconfigurations with one particle at site x and none elsewhere. We will be interested\nin initial configurations where \u03bd = \u03b4x . In such a case we will use the notation\nPxw instead of P\u03b4wx and Exw for the corresponding expectation. In the case where\nx \u2208 G(w), we adopt the convention that Pxw is the probability measure which has a\nunique atom at the configuration \u03b7 \u2261 0 (\u03b7(x) = 0 for every x \u2208 Zd ).\nLet us denote by P(W ) the set of probability measures defined on the space W =\nd\n([0, \u221e) \u00d7 [0, \u221e])Z endowed with its natural \u03c3-algebra. In the sequel we will take\nfields v+ and v\u2212 which are random, assigning a probability measure \u03bc \u2208 P(W ) in\nsuch a way that the field configuration {w(x) : x \u2208 Zd } has independent coordinates\nwith respect to \u03bc. Furthermore, we will use the notation h*i to denote expectation\nwith respect to this law and V ar\u03bc (*) variance. Now, let us define the quenched first\nmoment on Zd of the total number of particles at time t starting from site x as,\nm(x, t, w) := Exw [\u03b6(t)], and the annealed first moment on Zd of the total number of\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n11\n\nR\nparticles at time t starting from site x as, hm(x, t)i := m(x, t, w)d\u03bc. Furthermore,\nwe call the sets {m(x, t, w) : x \u2208 Zd } and {hm(x, t)i : x \u2208 Zd }, the fields of quenched\nfirst moments and the field of annealed first moments, respectively. Depending\non the context, we might write m or m(x, t) in place of m(x, t, w), dropping the\ndependence on the field configuration w, and hmi instead of hm(x, t)i.\nThe quantity which will give us a transition mechanism between of the quenched\nfirst moments is the averaged first moment at scale L and time t defined for a\nreaction-diffusion process starting from site x as,\nmL (x, t, w) :=\n\n1\n|\u039b(x, L)|\n\nX\n\nm(y, t, w).\n\ny\u2208\u039b(x,L)\n\n2.2. Results giving conditions for no explosion.

Consider the reaction diffusion process with field w and initial law\n\u03bd. Assume that,\nlim sup\n|x|\u2192\u221e\n\nv+ (x)\n= 0.\n|x| log |x|\n\n(8)\n\nThen for every t \u2265 0 we have that\n\nE\u03bdw [\u03b6(t)] < \u221e.\nHence, there is no explosion.\nWe state below with the name of proposition 2, a result of G\u00e4rtner-Molchanov\n[GM(1990)] (lemma 2.5) giving a sufficient condition on the law \u03bc in order that the\nfirst moment of the total number of particles \u03b6(t) at time t, exists \u03bc-a.s., and hence\nthat there is no explosion. Given a field configuration w = (v+ , v\u2212 ), we now need to\nintroduce the effective potential {v(x) : x \u2208 Zd }, defined by v(x) := v+ (x) \u2212 v\u2212 (x).\nFurthermore, set log+ x = log x if x > e and log+ x = 1 otherwise, while define the\npositive part x+ := max(0, x).\nProposition 2. Consider the reaction diffusion process with field w and initial\nlaw \u03bd. Assume that the field configuration w is distributed according to a product\nprobability measure \u03bc \u2208 P(W ).

Furthermore, assumption (E) is enough for (9) to be satisfied, and hence to ensure no\nexplosion.\n2.3. The Gaussian-Annealed transition results. Here we will state the main\nresult of this paper, which shows how under different growth of scales, the averaged\nfirst moment has an asymptotic behavior where a law of large numbers is satisfied,\nand a central limit theorem can describe the fluctuations around this law of large\nnumbers. We will assume condition (E), ensuring the existence of the annealed first\nmoments. We will also need to consider the growth functions {H1 (t) = loghm(0, t)i :\nt \u2265 0} already defined in display (2) of the introduction and the intermittency\nexponents {F\u03b8 : \u03b8 \u2208 R}, defined in display (3).

Then in \u03bc-probability we have\nthat,\nlim\n\nmL (0, t, w) \u2212 hm(0, t)i\np\n\u226a 1.\nV ar\u03bc (m(0, t))\n\n(13)\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n13\n\nTo provide a better insight on the meaning of theorem 1, we will see the form that it\ntakes under the stronger assumption (SI), which includes the first universality class\nof [HKM(2005)]. This will be formulated as a corollary, which in the case \u03ba = 0\ngeneralizes theorem 2.1 and 2.2 of [BBM(2005)] to include distributions \u03bc of the\nfield, which not necessarily have regularly varying log-tails.\nCorollary 1. Consider a reaction-diffusion process with initial law \u03b40 and field\nw = (v+ , v\u2212 ) distributed according to a product measure \u03bc \u2208 P(W ). Consider\nthe cumulant intermittency exponents {G\u03b8 : \u03b8 \u2208 R} defined in display (4) and the\ncumulant generating function {H(t) : t \u2265 0} defined in display (1). Assume that\nconditions (E) and (SI) are satisfied. Then the following statements are true,\n(i) Law of large numbers.\nAssume that there is an \u01eb > 0 such that eventually\n\b\nin t, L(t) \u2265 exp d1 G\u01eb (t) .

In particular, log mH(t)\n\b\nis an \u01eb > 0 such that eventually in t, L(t) \u2264 exp 1d G\u2212\u01eb (t) . Then in \u03bcprobability we have\n\nmL (0, t, w)\n\u226a 1,\nhm(0, t)i\nas t \u2192 \u221e.\n(ii) Central limit theorem.\nAssume that there is an \u01eb > 0 such that eventually\n\b1\nin t, L(t) \u2265 exp d G\u01eb (2t) . Then,\nmL (0, t, w) \u2212 hm(0, t)i\np\n= N (0, 1),\nt\u2192\u221e\nV ar\u03bc (m(0, t))\nlim\n\nwhere the convergence is in the sense of distributions. Furthermore,\n\b 1 assume\nthat there is an \u01eb > 0 such that eventually in t, L(t) \u2264 exp d G\u2212\u01eb (2t) .\nThen in \u03bc-probability we have that,\nmL (0, t, w) \u2212 hm(0, t)i\np\n\u226a 1.\nV ar\u03bc (m(0, t))\n\nThe proof of corollary 1 in the case \u03ba = 0 follows from the observation that G\u03b8 (t) =\nF\u03b8 (t) in this case. The case \u03ba > 0 is a direct consequence of the fact that eH(t)\u22122d\u03bat \u2264\nhm(0, t)i \u2264 eH(t) , stated in theorem 3.1 of [GM(1990)], and the observation that\nG\u03b8 (t) \u2265 0 for \u03b8 > 0 and G\u03b8 (t) \u2264 0 for \u03b8 < 0, which follows from Jensen's inequality.\nNow, the following proposition, which will be proved in section 4, shows that the\ncondition,\nlim tH \u2032\u2032 (t) = \u221e,\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n(14)\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n14\n\nis sufficient for assumption (SI) to be true. This condition implies a kind of domination of the branching over the annihilation.\nProposition 3. Consider the cumulant exponents {G\u03b8 : \u03b8 \u2208 R}. Assume that\ncondition (14) is satisfied. Then, condition (SI) is satisfied. Furthermore: (i) for\nevery \u03b8 6= 0, there is a t0 \u2265 0, such that the function G\u03b8 (t) is monotone in t, for\nt \u2265 t0 ; (ii) there is a t1 \u2265 0, such that the function G\u03b8 (t) is monotone in \u03b8 for\nt \u2265 t1 .\nCondition (14) implies that the branching dominates the annihilation, in the sense\nthat H(t)/t \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 \u221e, which implies that the essential supremum of the\nrandom variable v(0) is infinite (see [GM(1990)]).\n2.4. Regularity assumptions on the intermittency exponents. . For the\npurpose of applications, it will be important to identify cases where the assumptions\nin theorem 1 can be formulated in a more explicit way. As it will be shown, the\nfollowing assumption on the intermittency exponents, turns out to fall in one of\nthese situations.\nAssumption (RI). The intermittency exponents {F\u03b8 (t) : \u03b8 6= R} satisfy the mild\nintermittency condition (MI). In addition, there exist two increasing functions\nf1 , f2 : R\\{0} \u2192 R and a function J(t) : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e), such that for \u03b8 6= 0\nsmall enough,\n(i) F\u03b8 (t) \u223c f1 (\u03b8)J(t), and F\u03b8 (2t) \u223c f2 (\u03b8)J(t).\n(ii) There exists two constants \u03b31 and \u03b32 , such that lim\u03b8\u21920 f1 (\u03b8) = \u03b31 and\nlim\u03b8\u21920 f2 (\u03b8) = \u03b32 .\nThroughout the sequel, the constants \u03b31 and \u03b32 will be called transition exponents\nand the function J growth exponent. It will be shown that there exist several important cases of random fields which fall in this category. Furthermore, the following\ncorollary of theorem 1 shows the convenience of assumption (RI).\nCorollary 2. Consider a reaction-diffusion process with initial law \u03b40 and field\nw = (v+ , v\u2212 ) distributed according to a product measure \u03bc \u2208 P(W ). Suppose that\nassumptions (E) and (RI) are satisfied with transition exponents \u03b31 and \u03b32 and\ngrowth function J. Then the following statements are true,\n(i) Law of large numbers. Assume that there is a \u03b3 > \u03b31 such that eventually\nin t, log L(t) \u2265 d1 \u03b3J(t). Then in \u03bc-probability we have\nmL (0, t, w)\n\u223c 1,\nhm(0, t)i\nas t \u2192 \u221e. Furthermore, assume that there is a 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b31 such that\neventually in t, log L(t) \u2264 d1 \u03b3J(t). Then in \u03bc-probability we have\nmL (0, t, w)\n\u226a 1,\nhm(0, t)i\nas t \u2192 \u221e.\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n15\n\n(ii) Central limit theorem. Assume that there is a \u03b3 > \u03b32 such that eventually\nin t, log L(t) \u2265 d1 \u03b3J(t). Then,\nmL (0, t, w) \u2212 hm(0, t)i\np\n= N (0, 1),\nt\u2192\u221e\nV ar\u03bc (m(0, t))\nwhere the convergence is in the sense of distributions. Furthermore, assume\nthat there is a 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b32 such that eventually in t, log L(t) \u2264 1d \u03b3J(t). Then\nin \u03bc-probability we have that,\nlim\n\nmL (0, t, w) \u2212 hm(0, t)i\np\n\u226a 1.\nV ar\u03bc (m(0, t))\n\nIn the next subsection we will apply corollary 2 to four situations each one falling\nin one of the universality classes described be van den Hofstad, K\u00f6nig and M\u00f6rters\nin [HKM(2005)]. These classes encompass all possible situations under three conditions. The first is condition (E), ensuring the existence of the positive moments\ndefining the cumulant generating functions (1). The second and third condition\navoids different qualitative behaviors of the potential at different scales. Le us formulate next the second condition of [HKM(2005)].\nAssumption (H). The function H(t)/t is in the de Haan class.\nA function f is said to be in the de Haan class if for some regularly varying function\ng : (0, \u221e) \u2192 R, we have that (f (\u03bbt) \u2212 f (t))/g(t) converges to a limit different from\n0 as t \u2192 \u221e, for \u03bb > 0. Let us recall that a function h is regularly varying at infinity\nwith index \u03c1, if for any a > 0 we have limx\u2192\u221e h(ax)/h(x) = a\u03c1 . This property\nwill be stated as h \u2208 R\u03c1 . Whenever (H) is satisfied, then H(t) is regularly varying\nwith index \u03b3 \u2265 0. Furthermore, in proposition 1.1 of [HKM(2005)], it is proven\nthat under assumption (H) there exist a function \u0124 : (0, \u221e) \u2192 R and a continuous\nfunction k(t) : (0, \u221e) \u2192 (0, \u221e) such that,\nH(ty) \u2212 yH(t)\n= \u0124(y) 6= 0,\n(15)\nt\u2192\u221e\nk(t)\nfor y \u2208 (0, 1) \u222a (1, \u221e). It is also shown that k(t) is regularly varying of index \u03b3. We\ncan now recall the third assumption of [HKM(2005)].\nlim\n\nAssumption (K). The limit k\u2217 = limt\u2192\u221e\n\nk(t)\nt\n\nexists in [0, \u221e].\n\nUnder assumptions (E), (H) and (K), the four universality classes defined in\n[HKM(2005)] are:\n(1) \u03b3 > 1, or \u03b3 = 1 and k \u2217 = \u221e.\n(2) \u03b3 = 1 and k\u2217 \u2208 (0, \u221e).\n(3) \u03b3 = 1 and k\u2217 = 0.\n(4) \u03b3 < 1.\nIn what follows we exhibit examples in each one of these classes satisfying assumption (RI) so that corollary 2 can be applied, and the transition exponents can be\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n16\n\nexplicitly written. In the sequel, following [HKM(2005)], we will call the third class\nthe class of almost bounded potentials.\n2.4.1. Unbounded potentials with Weibull type tails. Our first application of corollary\n1 will be to an example falling in the first universality class of [HKM(2005)]. We\nwill assume that the essential supremum of v(0) is \u221e, and the tails at \u221e of v(0)\nfollow a Weibull-type law, \u03bc[v(0) > x] = exp{\u2212h(x)} for x > 0, with h \u2208 R\u03c1\nfor some 1 < \u03c1 < \u221e. In the terminology of [BBM(2005)] in the context of i.i.d.\nrandom exponentials (\u03ba = 0 in our situation), this is called Case B. The following\nproposition shows that assumption (RI) is satisfied in this situation, and hence\ncorollary 2, which generalizes theorems 2.1 and 2.2 of [BBM(2005)] in case B form\n\u03ba = 0 to \u03ba > 0.\nProposition 4. Suppose that the essential supremum of the effective potential v(0)\nis \u221e with Weibull-type tails \u03bc[v(0) > x] = exp{\u2212h(x)} for x > 0, and h \u2208 R\u03c1 for\nsome 1 < \u03c1 < \u221e. Then assumption (RI) is satisfied with transition exponents\n\u03b31 =\n\n1\n,\n\u03c1\u22121\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03b32 = 2 \u03c1\u22121\n\n1\n,\n\u03c1\u22121\n\nand growth exponent,\nJ(t) = H(t).\nLet us now prove proposition 4. Note that under the conditions on the tail of the\nlaw of v(0), the cumulant generating function H(t) of v(0) is well defined, smooth,\nnon-decreasing and tends to infinity as t \u2192 \u221e. Furthermore, by the Kasahara\nexponential Tauberian theorem (see Bingham, Goldie and Teugels [BGT(1989)],\nTheorem 4.12.7), we know that H \u2208 R\u03c1\u2032 , where the index \u03c1\u2032 is defined by the\nequation,\n1\n1\n+ \u2032 = 1.\n\u03c1 \u03c1\n\u00bfFrom this observation it is easy to check that assumption (SI) of corollary 1 is\nsatisfied, and that for every \u01eb 6= 0, the cumulant growth exponents G\u01eb (t) and G\u01eb (2t)\nsatisfy\n\u2032\n\n(1 + \u01eb)\u03c1 \u2212 (1 + \u01eb)\nG\u01eb (t)\n\u223c\nH(t)\n\u01eb\nand\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c1 \u2212 (1 + \u01eb)\n\u2032 (1 + \u01eb)\nG\u01eb (2t)\n\u223c 2\u03c1\n.\nH(t)\n\u01eb\n\u2032\n\n(1+\u01eb)\u03c1 \u2212(1+\u01eb)\nis increasing in \u01eb and converges to\n\u01eb\n\u2032\n\u03c1\n\u2032\n2\u03c1 (1+\u01eb) \u01eb\u2212(1+\u01eb) is increasing in \u01eb and converges\n\n1\n\u03c1\u22121\n\nas \u01eb \u2192 0,\n\nNow note that\n\n\u03b31 =\n\nand similarly\n\u01eb \u2192 0.\n\nto \u03b32 = 2 \u03c1\u22121 \u03b31 as\n\n\u03c1\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n17\n\n2.4.2. Unbounded potentials with double exponential type tails. Here we consider the\nsecond universality class so that H is regularly varying with index \u03b3 = 1 and\nk\u2217 \u2208 (0, \u221e). As shown in [HKM(2005)] in proposition 1.1, this is equivalent to\nthe existence of a constant \u03c1 \u2208 (0, \u221e) such that\nH(yt) \u2212 yH(t)\n= \u03c1y log y,\n(16)\nt\u2192\u221e\nt\nfor all y \u2208 (0, 1) \u222a (1, \u221e) (this and 0 < \u03c1 < \u221e is called assumption (H) in\n[GM(1998)]). Furthermore, under assumption (16) it is true that,\nlim\n\nH(t)\n= \u221e.\nt\nThis second universality class includes the case of unbounded potentials which are\ndouble exponentially distributed with parameter \u03c1, 0 < \u03c1 < \u221e,\no\nn\n\u03bc[v(0) > x] = exp \u2212ex/\u03c1 ,\nlim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nfor x \u2208 R.

We will consider the case in\nwhich the essential\nsupremum of v(0) is 0 and the tails are of Fr\u00e9chet-type: \u03bc[v(0) >\n\b\n\u2212x] = exp \u2212h(x\u22121 for x > 0, with h \u2208 R\u03c1 for some 0 < \u03c1 < \u221e. Using the\nterminology of [BBM(2005)] in the context of i.i.d. random exponentials, this is Case\nA. To state appropriately this result, we will need to recall the work of Biskup and\nK\u00f6nig [BK(2001)], who studied the asymptotics of the annealed and quenched first\nmoments in the case of product environments \u03bc such that the cumulant generating\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n19\n\nfunction H(t) is in the so called \u03b3-class for some \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1). We say that H is in\nthe \u03b3-class if the essential supremum of v(0) is 0 and if there is a non-decreasing\nfunction \u03b1t \u2208 (0, \u221e) and a function H\u0303 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 (\u2212\u221e, 0], H\u0303 6= 0, such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt\n\u03b1d+2\nt\nH\ny = H\u0303(t),\n(20)\nlim\nt\u2192\u221e\nt\n\u03b1dt\nfor y \u2265 0, uniformly on compact sets in (0, \u221e). We will denote the function \u03b1t the\nscale function. It is not difficult to show, using the de Bruijn exponential Tauberian\ntheorem [BGT(1989)], that if v(0) is in case A for some \u03c1 > 0, then H is in the\n\u03c1\n, or \u03c11\u2032 \u2212 1\u03c1 = 1. We can now sate the following proposition.\n\u03c1\u2032 -class for \u03c1\u2032 = \u03c1+1\nProposition 7. Suppose that the essential supremum of the effective potential v(0)\nis 0 with Fr\u00e9chet-type tails \u03bc[v(0) > \u2212x] = exp{\u2212h(x\u22121 )} for x > 0, and h \u2208 R\u03c1\nfor some 0 < \u03c1 < \u221e.

In proposition 2.1 of [BK(2001)], it is shown that\nwhenever \u03bc is in the \u03c1\u2032 -class, then the scaling function \u03b1t \u2208 R\u03bd , for,\n1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032\n.\nd + 2 \u2212 d\u03c1\u2032\nFurthermore, theorem 1.2 of [BK(2001)] states that when \u03bc is in the \u03c1\u2032 -class, there\nexists a \u03c7 \u2208 (0, \u221e) such that,\n\u03bd :=\n\nloghm(0, t)\u03b2 i \u223c \u2212\u03c7\n\n\u03b2t\n,\n\u03b12\u03b2t\n\nfor every \u03b2 \u2208 (0, \u221e).

We believe that the four functions aW , aD , aA , aF\nare sharp, in the sense that the quantities of the four parts of theorem 2 diverge if\nthe sign of \u03b4 is changed.

The whole picture suggested by theorem 2 seems to indicate the\npresence of a phase transition type behavior, as it is found in some mean field\nstatistical mechanics models like the Random Energy Model [D(1981)], [BKL(2002)].\nIndeed, when combined with part (i) of theorem 1, we conclude that log mL (0, t, w) \u223c\n\u0101(\u03b3)J(t), where \u0101(\u03b3) equals aW , aD , aA or aF depending on the potential for \u03b3 < \u03b31 ,\nwhile \u0101(\u03b3) = 1 for \u03b3 > 1. Thus, there is non-analyticity at \u03b3 = 1 of a quantity\nplaying the role of a \"free energy\".\n3. The conditions for no explosion\nIn this section we will prove proposition 1. Since the initial conditions \u03bd \u2208 P(V )\nare concentrated on configurations with a finite number of particles, and by translation invariance of the dynamics of the reaction-diffusion process on Zd , note that\nit is enough to consider the case where \u03bd = \u03b40 .\n3.1.

Then, for every \u03b1 > 1,\nH(\u03b1t) \u2212 \u03b1H(t)\n= \u221e.\nt\u2192\u221e\nt\nlim\n\n(27)\n\nProof. Part (i). Let t1 , t2 \u2265 0. \u00bfFrom H\u00f6lder's inequality, we have that \u03c6(t1 )\u03c6(t2 ) \u2264\n\u03c6(t1 + t2 ). Hence, H(t1 + t2 ) \u2265 H(t1 ) + H(t2 ). By induction on n we conclude the\nproof.\nPart (ii). From the assumption, note that we can write H \u2032\u2032 (t) = f (t)\nt , where\nlimt\u2192\u221e f (t) = \u221e. Integrating the function H \u2032\u2032 from t to \u03b1t, it follows that,\nH \u2032 (\u03b1t) \u2212 H \u2032 (t) \u2265 inf f (s) * log \u03b1.\ns\u2265t\n\n(28)\n\nIntegrating again we obtain for u > t that,\nH(\u03b1t) \u2212 \u03b1H(t) \u2265 (t \u2212 u)inf s\u2265u f (s) * \u03b1 log \u03b1 + c(u),\nwhere c(u) = H(\u03b1u) \u2212 \u03b1H(u). Dividing by t, taking the limit when t \u2192 \u221e and\nthen the limit when u \u2192 \u221e, we obtain (27).\n\u0003\nLet us now prove parts (i) and (ii) of proposition 3. Note that,\n(1 + \u03b8)H \u2032 ((1 + \u03b8)t) \u2212 (1 + \u03b8)H \u2032 (t)\n\u2202G\n=\n.\n\u2202t\n\u03b8\nThen, inequality (28) implies part (i) of the lemma. On the other hand we have\nthat,\n\u2202G\n\u03b8tH \u2032 ((1 + \u03b8)t) \u2212 H((1 + \u03b8)t) + H(t)\n=\n,\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u03b82\nBy the mean value theorem there exists a \u03b8\u0304 such that 0 < \u03b8\u0304 < \u03b8 and H((1 +\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b8)t)\n\u0002 \u2212\u2032 H(t) = \u03b8tH \u2032((1 + \u03b8\u0304)t) \u0003and hence \u03b8tH ((1 + \u03b8)t) \u2212 H((1 + \u03b8)t) + H(t) =\n\u03b8t H ((1 + \u03b8)t) \u2212 H ((1 + \u03b8\u0304)t) , which by inequality (28) is positive if t \u2265 t1 , where\nt1 is independent of \u03b8 and \u03b8\u0304. This proves that G\u03b8 (t) is monotone in \u03b8 for t \u2265 t1 .\nWe now show that condition (14) ensures (SI). We will without loss of generality\nassume that \u03ba > 0. Let us define real valued functions f, g by f (x) := H(\u03b8t + xt) \u2212\nH(xt) and g(x) := 2x for real x.

The proof of the case in which \u03b8 < 0 is similar and the details will be\nomitted.\nWe now continue in subsection 4.2, defining the truncated quenched first moments,\nand then describing the parabolic Anderson equation satisfied by the quenched first\nmoments and the corresponding Feynman-Kac representations.\n4.2. Truncated quenched first moments. In the sequel, given a real function\nf (x) defined on Zd , we will define the discrete Laplacian by,\nX\n\u2206f (x) :=\n(f (x + e) \u2212 f (x)) .\n(29)\ne\u2208Zd :|e|=1\n\nLet us now for each finite set U \u2282 Zd and environment w \u2208 W , define the field\nU , v ) with v U (x) = v (x) for x \u2208 U , while v U (x) = \u221e for x \u2208\n/ U . We now\nwU := (v\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\ndefine for x \u2208 Zd and t \u2265 0,\nm\u0303U (x, t, w) := m(x, t, wU ).\nAs it will be seen later, this expression satisfies the parabolic Anderson equation with\nDirichlet boundary conditions. We will denote this quantity the truncated quenched\nfirst moment on U at time t for a reaction-diffusion process starting from x. Also, we\nwill call the set {m\u0303U (x, t, w) : x \u2208 Zd }, the field of truncated first moments on U at\ntime t. Now, in the particular case in which U = \u039b(x, r) for some r > 0, we will use\nthe notation m\u0303r (x, t, w) instead of m\u0303U (x, t, w). We will refer to this quantity as the\ntruncated quenched first moment at scale r at time t for a reaction-diffusion process\nstarting from site x. Furthermore, we will call the sets {m\u0303r (x, t, w) : x \u2208 Zd }, the\nfield of truncated quenched first moments at scale r at time t.\n4.3. The parabolic Anderson equations. Here we will recall the moment equations satisfied by the field of quenched first moments {m(x, t, w)} and by the corresponding truncated fields. Following [GM(1990)], we have the proposition.\nProposition 8. Let U \u2282 Zd be a finite set and w \u2208 W an environment. Consider\nthe field of quenched first moments {m(x, t, w) : x \u2208 Zd } on Zd at time t and the\nfield of truncated quenched first moments {m\u0303U (x, t, w) : x \u2208 Zd } on U at time t.\nThen the following statements are true.\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n27\n\n(i) The field of truncated quenched first moments {m\u0303U (x, t, w) : x \u2208 Zd } of the\ntotal number of particles at time t on U , satisfies the equation,\n\u2202 m\u0303U\n= \u03ba\u2206m\u0303U + v(x)m\u0303U ,\nfor x \u2208 U \u2229 G(w)c\n\u2202t\nm\u0303U (x, 0, w) = 1,\nfor x \u2208 Zd .\nm\u0303U (x, t, w) = 0,\nfor x \u2208\n/ U \u2229 G(w)c , t > 0.\n(ii) The field of quenched first moments {m(x, t, w) : x \u2208 Zd } of the total number\nof particles at time t on Zd , satisfies the equation,\n\u2202m\n= \u03ba\u2206m + v(x)m,\nfor x \u2208 G(w)c\n\u2202t\nm(x, 0, w) = 1,\nfor x \u2208 Zd .\nm(x, t, w) = 0,\nfor x \u2208\n/ G(w)c , t > 0.\nProof. Consider the family of functions {uz (x, t) := Exw [z \u03b6(t) ]}, parametrized by\ncomplex z such that 0 < |z| \u2264 1. It is easy to see that,\n\u2202uz\n= \u03ba\u2206uz + v+ (x)u2z \u2212 (v+ (x) + v\u2212 (x))uz + v\u2212 (x),\n\u2202t\nuz (x, 0) = z,\nfor x \u2208\nwhile uz (x, t) = 1 for t \u2265 0 and x \u2208 G(w). Differentiating the above\nequation with respect to z we obtain part (i). A similar proof can be carried out for\npart (ii).\n\u0003\nG(w)c ,\n\n4.4. Bounds on the quenched first moments. We will now obtain upper and\nlower bounds for the annealed moments of the quenched first moments. Let us first\nrecall two elementary inequalities.

We then need\nto estimate the truncated quenched first moment at scale (\u03b2\u03bat)a , m\u0303(\u03b2\u03bat)a (x, t, w).\nFirst remark the following expansion in terms of the eigenvalues {\u03bbn (x, (\u03b2\u03bat)a , w)}\nx,(\u03b2\u03bat)a ,w\nand the corresponding eigenfunctions {\u03c8n\n},\n2\n\nm\u0303(\u03b2\u03bat)a (x, t, w) =\n\nU\n\u22121\nX\n\na ,w)\n\net\u03bbn (x,(\u03b2\u03bat)\n\na ,w\n\n\u03c8nx,(\u03b2\u03bat)\n\na ,w\n\n(x)(\u03c8nx,(\u03b2\u03bat)\n\n, 1(A)),\n\n(45)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere A := \u039b(x, (\u03b2\u03bat)a , w).

The second inequality of display (42) of part (ii) now follows noting that for\na > 1 the second term in the right-hand factor of the above inequality is negligible\nwith respect to the first term.\nLet us now prove the first inequality of display (42).

Correlation and variance estimates on the field of quenched first moments. In order to prove part (ii) of theorem 1, it will be important to have a\ncontrol on the variance of the the quenched first moments. In the sequel of this\npaper, to avoid heavy notation, we will use ma instead of m(\u03bat)a . Given x, y \u2208 Zd\nand t \u2265 0, let us define,\nc(x, y, t) := hm(x, t)m(y, t)i \u2212 hm(x, t)i hm(y, t)i ,\nwhich we will call the correlation between sites x and y at time t of the field of\nquenched first moments. Similarly let us define for a > 0,\nca (x, y, t) := hm\u0303a (x, t)m\u0303a (y, t)i \u2212 hm\u0303a (x, t)i hm\u0303a (y, t)i ,\nthe correlation between sites x and y at time t of the truncated field of quenched\nfirst moments at scale (\u03bat)a . Let us begin with the following lemma.\nLemma 6. Let t \u2265 0. Consider the fields of quenched first moments {m(x, t, w) :\nx \u2208 Zd } and truncated quenched first moments at scale (\u03bat)a , {m\u0303a (x, t, w) : x \u2208 Zd }.\nThen the following statements are true.\n(i) The sum of the correlations between site 0 and the other sites of the field of\nquenched first moments, behaves asymptotically as t \u2192 \u221e like the sum of\nthe correlations between site 0 and the other sites of the truncated field of\nquenched first moments at scale (\u03bat)a .

Part (i). From the Feynman-Kac representation (33) of lemma 4, note that\nit is possible to write,\nh P\ni\nm(x, t, w) = Ex e z\u2208Zd v(z)L(z,t) 1(A) ,\nRt\nwhere A := {\u03c4G c (w) > t}, L(z, t) := 0 \u03b4z (Xs )ds is the local time at the point z of\nthe random walk {Xt : t \u2265 0} starting from x, and \u03b4z : Zd \u2192 {0, 1} is the indicator\nfunction of the set {z}. \u00bfFrom here, using Fubini's theorem it follows that we have\nthe following representation for the correlations between site x and y of the quenched\nfield of first moments.\nhD P\nE D P\nED P\nEi\ne z\u2208Zd v(L+L\u0303) 1(A \u2229 \u00c3) \u2212 e z\u2208Zd vL 1(A) e z\u2208Zd vL\u0303 1(\u00c3)\n(53)\nRt\nwhere L\u0303(z, t) := 0 \u03b4z (X\u0303s )ds is the local time at the point z of the random walk\n{X\u0303t : t \u2265 0}, independent of {Xt : t \u2265 0}, starting from y, with law Py , and \u00c3\nis an identical copy of A, but defined in terms of the random walk {X\u0303t : t \u2265 0}.\nFurthermore, Ex,y := Ex \u2297 Ey , denotes the expectation with respect to the law of\nthe independent random walks {Xt } and {X\u0303t }. Now, the expression (53) for the\ncorrelations can be written in terms of the cumulant generating function defined in\ndisplay (1),\ni\nh P\nP\nP\n(54)\nc(x, y, t) = Ex,y e z\u2208Zd H(L+L\u0303) \u2212 e z\u2208Zd H(L) e z\u2208Zd H(L\u0303) ,\nc(x, y, t) = Ex,y\n\nwhere we have used the independence of the coordinates of the effective potential\n{v(x) : x \u2208 Zd } under \u03bc. Note that the super-additivity of H (part (i) of lemma 3),\nimplies that this expression is non-negative. On the other hand, a reasoning similar\nto the one leading to the representation (54), this time based on the Feynman-Kac\nrepresentation (34) of lemma 4, enables us to deduce that,\n\u0011i\nh\n\u0010P\nP\nP\nca (x, y, t)=Ex,y 1(\u03c4a > t)1(\u03c4\u0303a > t) e z\u2208Zd H(L+L\u0303)\u2212 e z\u2208Zd H(L) e z\u2208Zd H(L\u0303) ,\n\n(55)\n\nwhere \u03c4a := \u03c4\u039b(x,(\u03bat)a ) = inf{t \u2265 0 : Xt 6\u2208 \u039b(x, (\u03bat)a )} and \u03c4\u0303a := \u03c4\u0303\u039b(x,(\u03bat)a ) := inf{t \u2265\n0 : X\u0303t 6\u2208 \u039b(y, (\u03bat)a )}. From (54) and (55) it follows that,\nX\n\ny\u2208Zd\n\nc(0, y, t) \u2265\n\nX\n\ny\u2208Zd\n\nca (0, y, t).\n\n(56)\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n35\n\nBut note that in reality, due to the independence between any pair of truncated\nquenched\nat time t at two points at a distance larger than 2(\u03bat)a , we\nP first moments P\nhave y\u2208Zd ca (0, y, t) = y\u2208\u039b2(\u03bat)a ca (0, y, t). Furthermore,\nX\nX\nX\nc(0, y, t) =\nc(0, y, t) +\nc(0, y, t).\n(57)\ny\u2208\u039b2(\u03bat)a\n\ny\u2208Zd\n\ny6\u2208\u039b2(\u03bat)a\n\nNow, an application of the first inequality of display (35) of part (i) of proposition\n9Pand of part (ii) of the\nP same proposition, shows that since a > 0, it is true that\nc(0,\ny,\nt)\n\u223c\ny\u2208\u039b2(\u03bat)a\ny\u2208\u039b2(\u03bat)a ca (0, y, t). And a second application of display (35)\nP\nand the first inequality in display (23) of lemma 2, shows that y6\u2208\u039b2(\u03bat)a c(0, y, t) \u226a\nP\ny\u2208\u039b2(\u03bat)a c(0, y, t). This, together with inequality (56), ends up the proof of part\n(i) of lemma 6.\nPart (ii). We will first prove (51). Remark that,\nX\nX\nX\nca (x, y, t) =\nca (x, y, t),\nm\u0303a (x, t) =\nV ar\u03bc\nx,y\u2208Ut\n\nx\u2208Ut\n\nx,y\u2208Ut :||x\u2212y||\u22642(\u03bat)a\n\nwhere we used as in the proof of part (i), the fact that m\u0303a (x, t, v) and m\u0303a (y, t, v)\nare independent for ||x \u2212 y|| \u2265P2(\u03bat)a . Now, the right-most member of the above\ninequality is bounded by, |Ut | y:||y||\u22642ta ca (0, y, t), which gives us the inequality,\nX\nX\nm\u0303a (x, t) \u2264 |Ut |\nca (0, y, t).\nV ar\u03bc\nx\u2208Ut\n\ny\u2208Zd\n\nSimilarly we can conclude that,\nX\nX\nm\u0303a (x, t) \u2265 |Ut,(\u03bat)a |\nca (0, y, t).\nV ar\u03bc\nx\u2208Ut\n\ny\u2208Zd\n\nThis finishes the proof of the statement of display (51). The statement of display\n(50) now follows from display (51), part (i) of lemma 6 proved above, and the\ninequalities,\nX\nX\nX\nma (x, t) \u2264 |Ut |\nc(0, y, t).\nm\u0303a (x, t) \u2264 V ar\u03bc\nV ar\u03bc\nx\u2208Ut\n\nx\u2208Ut\n\ny\u2208Zd\n\nFinally, note that (52) is a trivial consequence of (50) and (51).\n\n\u0003\n\n5. The Annealed and Gaussian regimes\nHere we will prove parts (i) and (ii) of theorem 1, making use of the estimates\nobtained in the previous section, and theorem 2. The main argument which will\nbe used to prove 1 is a renormalization method, which we call partition analysis, as\ndeveloped in [BMR(2005)]. In order to present a self-contained proof, in the first\nsubsection we recall this technique. Then, in the second subsection, we derive some\nimportant estimates via the partition analysis technique, which will enable us to\nreduce the proofs to sums of independent random variables. In the third subsection\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n36\n\nwe prove the law of large numbers, stated in display (10) of part (i) of theorem\n1. In the fourth subsection we will prove the negative part (absence of a law of\nlarge numbers) stated in display (11) of part (i) of theorem 1. In subsection 5.5, we\nwill prove the central limit theorem stated in display (12) of part (ii) of theorem 1.\nThen, in subsection 5.6 we prove the absence of a central limit behavior stated in\ndisplay (13) of part (ii) of the same theorem. Finally, in subsection 5.7, we prove\ntheorem 2.\n5.1. Partition Analysis. Here we shall follow closely section 5.1 of Ben Arous,\nMolchanov and Ram\u0131\u0301rez [BMR(2005)]. For a fixed natural L we consider the box\n\u039bL = {x \u2208 Zd : ||x|| \u2264 L}. We will define two related but different kinds of partitions\nof \u039bL . The first one shows that \u039bL can be decomposed\nS into disjoint partition boxes\n{\u039b\u2032i : i \u2208 I}, indexed by some set I, so that \u039bL = i \u039b\u2032i . The second one defines\na partition of \u039bL in a strip set and main boxes {\u039b\u2032\u2032i : i \u2208 I}. In the first case,\nthe index set I will be partitioned in disjoint subsets {IK : K \u2208 K}, where the\ncardinality of K is 2d , in such a way that for each K \u2208 K any pair of elements of\nthe collection of partition boxes {\u039b\u2032i : i \u2208 IK } is at a large Euclidean distance. In\nthe second partition case, it turns out that the survival probabilities corresponding\nto sites in the strip set have a total sum which is negligible, while the main boxes\nhappen to be essentially independent. To proceed we will need to introduce some\nnotation defining the corresponding scales and subsets.\nOur first parameter is a natural number L\u2032 smaller than or equal to L, which will\nbe called the mesoscopic scale. By the division algorithm, we know that there exist\nnatural numbers q and q\u0304 such that 2L + 1 = qL\u2032 + q\u0304, with 0 \u2264 q\u0304 < q. Note that this\nlast equation can be written in the form\n2L + 1 =\n\nq\nX\n\nL\u2032i ,\n\n(58)\n\ni=1\n\nwith L\u2032i = L\u2032 + \u03b8q\u0304 (i) and \u03b8q\u0304 (i) = 1 for i \u2264 q\u0304 and \u03b8q\u0304 (i) = 0 for i > q\u0304.\nFor our purposes, the relevant fact is that L\u2032 \u2264 L\u2032i \u2264 L\u2032 + 1. In the sequel, for any given pair of real numbers a, b we will use the notation [a, b]l for\n[a, b] \u2229 Z. We now will subdivide the box [\u2212L, L]l in intervals according to equa\u2032\ntion (58).\nThus, we define I1 := [\u2212L, \u2212L\nh\ni + L1 \u2212 1]l and for\u0002 1 < i \u2264 q \u0003we let\nPi\u22121 \u2032\nPi\nIi := \u2212L + j=1 Li , \u2212L + j=1 L\u2032i \u2212 1 . Note that Iq = L \u2212 L\u2032q + 1, L l and\nl\n\n|Ii | = L\u2032i . Next, we introduce a second parameter r which is a natural number smaller than or equal to L\u2032 . We will call r the fine scale. Then, for each\nIi we define an interval Ji such that Ji \u2282 Ii , |Ji | = L\u2032 \u2212 2r and the endpoints\nof Ji are at a distance larger than r to the endpoints of Ii . To do so, first let\nri := r + h\u03b8q\u0304 (i). Then define J1 := [\u2212L + r, \u2212L + L\u20321 i\u2212 1 \u2212 r1 ]l and for 1 < i \u2264 q we\nP\nPi\n\u2032\n\u2032\nlet Ji := \u2212L + i\u22121\nj=1 Li + r, \u2212L +\nj=1 Li \u2212 1 \u2212 ri .\nl\nWe now proceed to define the partition in \u039bL in partition boxes and define the corresponding decomposition of the index set. First we define the set I := {1, 2, . . . , q}d ,\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n37\n\nwhich will correspond to the indexes parameterizing the sub-boxes. For a given element i \u2208 I, of the form i = (i1 , . . . , id ) with 1 \u2264 ik \u2264 q, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d, we define\n\u039b\u2032i := Ii1 \u00d7 Ii2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Iid .\nWe will call such a set a partition box. By definition the cardinality |\u039b\u2032i | of a partition\nbox satisfies,\n(59)\n(L\u2032 )d \u2264 |\u039b\u2032i | \u2264 (L\u2032 + 1)d .\nS\nNote also that the partition boxes defines a partition of \u039bL so that \u039bL = i\u2208I \u039b\u2032i\nwhere the union is disjoint.\nNext we define a partition of the index set I. Consider the collection K of subsets\nof {1, 2, . . . , d}. Note that |K| = 2d . Now given K \u2208 K we define IK as the subset of\nI having coordinates which are even for k \u2208 K and odd for k \u2208\n/ K. In other words,\nif we define E as the set of even natural numbers and O as the set of odd natural\nnumbers then,\nIK := {i = (i1 , . . . , id ) \u2208 I : ik \u2208 E if k \u2208 K, ik \u2208 O if k \u2208\n/ K, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d}.\nS\nNote that {IK : K \u2208 K} defines a partition of I so that I = K\u2208K IK is a disjoint\nunion. Hence,\nX X X\n\nf (x) =\n\nX\n\nf (x),\n\n(60)\n\nx\u2208\u039bL\n\nK\u2208K i\u2208IK x\u2208\u039b\u2032i\n\nfor\nf : \u039bL \u2192 R, which is a consequence of the fact that \u039bL =\nS every\nS function\n\u2032 is a disjoint union. We will refer to such a decomposition as the\n\u039b\nK\u2208K i\u2208IK i\nparity partition at scale L\u2032 of \u039bL . Furthermore, given K \u2208 K and any pair of boxes\n\u039b\u2032i and \u039b\u2032j with i, j \u2208 IK and i 6= j we have that,\n\u0001\ndist \u039b\u2032i , \u039b\u2032j \u2265 L\u2032 .\n\n(61)\n\nHere for any pair of subsets A, B \u2282 Zd we define dist(A, B) := inf x\u2208A,y\u2208B |x \u2212 y|. In\nother words (61) expresses the fact that the distance between any pair of partition\nboxes with different sub-indexes in IK is larger than or equal to L\u2032 . This completes\nthe description of the partition of \u039bL in partition boxes.\nNext, we describe the partition of \u039bL into the strip set and main boxes. Given\nan i \u2208 I we let,\n\u039b\u2032\u2032i := Ji1 \u00d7 Ji2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Jid .\nSuch a box will be called a main box. Its cardinality is |\u039b\u2032\u2032i | = (L\u2032 \u2212 2r)d . Now let,\nSL := \u039bL \u2212\n\n[\n\n\u039b\u2032\u2032i .\n\ni\u2208I\n\nSuch a set will be called the strip set. Note that SL and {\u039b\u2032\u2032L : i \u2208 I} define a\npartition of \u039bL . We will refer to such a partition as the strip-box partition at scale\n\n\fTRANSITION ASYMPTOTICS FOR RANDOM WALKS\n\n38\n\nL\u2032 of \u039bL . We furthermore remark the following cardinality estimate for the strip set\nwhich will be useful later,\n\u0001\n(L\u2032 + 1)d \u2212 (L\u2032 \u2212 2r)d\n|SL |\n\u2264\n,\n(62)\n(2L + 1)d\n(L\u2032 )d\nwhere we have used the fact that |I| = q d .\n5.2. Moment and decoupling inequalities. Following [BMR(2005)], we recall here some standard inequalities and derive inequalities involving sums of the\nquenched first moments that will be necessary to perform the partition analysis.\nLet us first recall the well-known inequality of von Bahr and Esseen (page 82,\nexercise 2.6.20, of Petrov [Pt(1996)]).\nLemma 7. (von Bahr-Esseen).\nLet X1 , . . . , Xn be mean zero independent random\nP\nvariables and Sn := nk=1 Xi . Then if E denotes the expectation with respect to the\njoint law of these random variables, and 1 \u2264 r \u2264 2, it is true that\nE|Sn | \u2264 2\n\nn\nX\n\nE|Xk |r .\n\n(63)\n\nk=1\n\nWe continue with the following lemma (analogous to lemma 6 of [BMR(2005)]),\nwhich is a consequence of (63) and (31).\nLemma 8. Let a > 1. Consider the field of truncated quenched first moments\n{m\u0303a (x, t, w) : x \u2208 Zd } at scale (\u03bat)a . Let L(t), L\u2032 (t) : [0, \u221e) \u2192 N be functions such\nthat (\u03bat)a \u2264 L\u2032 (t) \u2264 L(t). Then if 1 \u2264 r \u2264 2, it is true that,\n*\n\nX\n\nx\u2208\u039bL\n\n(m\u0303a \u2212 hm\u0303a i)\n\nr+\n\n\u2264 2(2L\u2032 + 2)d(r\u22121) (2L + 1)d h|m\u0303a \u2212 hm\u0303a i|r i .\n\n(64)\n\nProof. The proof of this result is analogous to that of lemma 6 of [BMR(2005)],\nrequiring the use of the decomposition (60) with f (x) = m\u03031 (x, t, w) \u2212 hm\u03031 i(x, t),\nvon Bahr-Esseen inequality (63) and Jensen's inequality (30).\n\u0003\nNext, we have the following estimate analogous to lemma 7 of [BMR(2005)].\nLemma 9. Let a > 1. Consider the field of quenched first moments {m(x, t, w) :\nx \u2208 Zd } and of truncated quenched first moments {ma (x, t, w) : x \u2208 Zd } at scale\n(\u03bat)a . Let L(t) : [0, \u221e) \u2192 N be such that (\u03bat)a \u226a L.

We will chose a time dependent mesoscopic\nscale L\u2032 (t) = (\u03bat)b , where 0 < a < b.

The Gaussian asymptotics. Here we prove the central limit theorem stated\nin display (12) of part (ii) of theorem 1. We will perform this time a strip-box\npartition of the box \u039bL into the strip set SL and the main boxes.

For this purpose, since the random variables\n(m\u0303a \u2212 hm\u0303a i) : i \u2208 I are independent, it is enough to verify a version of the\nx\u2208\u039b\u2032\u2032\ni\nLyapunov condition. Namely, we will show that,\n\u001d\n\u001c\n2+\u01eb\nP\nP\n(m\u0303a \u2212 hm\u0303a i)\ni\u2208I\nx\u2208\u039b\u2032\u2032\ni\n(79)\n\u0010P\n\u00111+\u01eb/2 \u226a 1,\nP\nV\nar\nm\u0303\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03bc\na\ni\u2208I\nx\u2208\u039b\ni\n\nand then apply again statement (51) of part (ii) of lemma 6 to conclude that the\nvariance\nof P\nthe denominator of the second term of display can be substituted by\nP\nV\nar\nm\u0303a . Now, by the same token, we see that the denominator of the\n\u03bc\ni\u2208I\nx\u2208\u039b\u2032\u2032\ni\nleft-hand side of display (79), behaves asymptotically as t \u2192 \u221e like\n\uf8eb\n\n(2L + 1)d(1+\u01eb/2) \uf8ed\n\nX\n\nx\u2208Zd\n\n\uf8f61+\u01eb/2\n\nca (0, x, t)\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n(80)\n\nThus, it is enough to prove the asymptotic\nbehavior (79), with the denominator\nP\nreplaced by (80). Now, note that x\u2208Zd ca (0, x, t) is lower bounded by hm\u03032a (0, t)i \u2212\nhm\u0303a (0, t)i2 .

The non-Gaussian asymptotics. Here we will prove the asymptotics of display (13) of part (ii) of theorem 1. It will be necessary to perform a parity partition\nof \u039bL with a mesoscopic scale L\u2032 = (\u03bat)b for some b > 1. First note that by display\n(66) of part (ii) of lemma 9 it will be enough to show that for some b > a > 1,\n* P\n\n(m\u0303a \u2212 hm\u0303a i)\nqx\u2208\u039bL P\nV ar\u03bc x\u2208\u039bL m\n\n2\u2212\u01eb +\n\n\u226a 1.\n\n(83)\n\n\u0010\n\u00111\u2212 \u01eb\nP\n2\nNow, by display (50) of part (ii) of lemma 6, the denominator V ar\u03bc x\u2208\u039bL m\n,\nof the left-hand side of display (83), can be lower-bounded by (2L +\n\u00011\u2212 \u01eb\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n1\u2212 2\u01eb\n2\n1)d(1\u2212 2 ) m2 \u2212 hmi2\n\u2265 c(2L + 1)d(1\u2212 2 ) m2\n\u2265 c((\u03bat)3da + 1)\u22121 (2L +\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n1)d(1\u2212 2 ) hm(0, 2t)i1\u2212 2 , where in the second to last inequality we used the assump-\n\ntion (MI) and lemma 5 and in the last inequality assumption 5. On the other\nhand, inequality (64) of lemma 8, applied with r = 2 \u2212 \u01eb, Jensen's inequality\nand m\u0303a \u2264 m, shows us that the numerator of the left-hand side of display (83)\n\u01eb\nis upper-bounded by 4(2L\u2032 + 1)d(1\u2212\u01eb) (2L + 1)d 2 hm2\u2212\u01eb i.

Proof of theorem 2. Let us first prove part (i) for Weibull-type tails. Note\nthat it is enough to find an x > 0 such that,\n\u001c\u0012\n\u0013x \u001d\nmL (0, t)\n\u226a 1.\ne(a(\u03b3)+\u03b4)H(t)\nNow, this expression is upper bounded by,\ne\u2212(x(a+\u03b4)H(t)\u2212H(xt)\u2212(1\u2212x)\u03b3H(t))+o(H(t)) ,\nwhere we have used the asymptotics (5). Since H \u2208 R\u03c1\u2032 for \u03c1\u2032 =\nthe above expression is upper bounded by,\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\u22121 ,\n\nwe see that\n\ne\u2212fW (x,a+\u03b4)H(t)+o(H(t)) ,\n\u2032\nwhere fW (x, b) := xb \u2212 x\u03c1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)\u03b3 for x > 0, b > 0. This function has a unique\n\u0010\n\u0011\u03c1\u22121\nroot at x0 = \u03c1\u22121\nwhen b = a(\u03b3). Choosing x = x0 , we get the upper\n\u03c1 (b + \u03b3)\nbound,\ne\u2212\u03b4x0 H(t)+o(H(t)) \u226a 1.\nThis proves part (i) of theorem 2. The proof of part (iv) for Fr\u00e9chet-type tails is\ncompletely analogous to the previous argument, so it will be omitted. To prove part\n(ii), note that in analogy to the proof of part (i), it is enough to show that,\n\"\n\"\n\u2212H(xt)\u2212(1\u2212x)\u03b3t +o(t)\n\u2212 x H((a+\u03b4)t)\na+\u03b4\n\ne\n\n\u226a 1.\n\nH(xt)\u2212xH((a+\u03b4)t)/(a+\u03b4)\nt\n\nNow, by supposition (16) we have\nexpression of display (84), is upper-bounded by,\n\n\u223c \u2212\u03c1x log\n\n(84)\nx\na+\u03b4 .\n\nThus, the\n\ne\u2212fD (x,a+\u03b4)t+o(t) ,\nwhere fD (x, b) := \u03c1x log xb \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)\u03b3 for x > 0, b > 0. But this function has a single\n1\n\nroot at x0 = ae \u03c1 (\u03b3\u22121) when b = a. Hence, we obtain the upper bound,\n\u03b4\ne\u2212x0 log(1+ a )+o(t) \u226a 1.\nThis proves part (ii) of theorem 2. The proof of part (iii) for almost bounded\npotentials is analogous to the proof of part (ii) so it will be omitted.\n\nAcknowledgments.
