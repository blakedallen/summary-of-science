INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently considerable attention has been focussed on the van der Waals and Casimir forces acting between macroscopic bodies. As for the van der Waals force, interest in it has quickened owing to its application in atomic force\nmicroscopy (see, e.g., the monographs [1,2] and references therein). Interest in the Casimir force was rekindled after\nthe new experiments [3,4] where it was measured more precisely in the case of metallic test bodies.\nIt is common knowledge that both forces are connected with the existence of zero point vacuum oscillations of\nthe electromagnetic field [5,6]. For closely spaced macroscopic bodies the virtual photon emitted by an atom of one\nbody reaches an atom of the second body during its lifetime. The correlated oscillations of the instantaneous induced\ndipole moments of those atoms give rise to the non-retarded van der Waals force. The Casimir force arises when the\ndistance between two bodies is so large that the virtual photon emitted by an atom of one body cannot reach the\nsecond body during its lifetime. Nevertheless, the correlation of the quantized electromagnetic field in a vacuum state\nis not equal to zero at two points where the atoms belonging to different bodies are situated. Hence the non-zero\ncorrelations of the induced atomic dipole moments arise once more resulting in the Casimir force (which is also known\nas the retarded van der Waals force).\nAs is shown in [4,7,8], the corrections to the Casimir force due to the finite conductivity of the metal and surface\nroughness play an important role in the proper interpretation of the measurement data.

In [4,7] the values of the finite conductivity corrections to\nthe Casimir force were found by the use of perturbation expansion in relative penetration depth of electromagnetic\nzero point oscillations into the metal which starts from the general Lifshitz formula [9\u201311]. The parameter of this\nexpansion is \u03bbp /(2\u03c0a), where \u03bbp is the effective plasma frequency of the electrons, a is the distance between interacting\nbodies. Note that the coefficient near the first order correction was obtained in [12,13], and near the second order\none in [14] for the configuration of two plane parallel plates. In [3,15] the results of [12,13] and, correspondingly, [14]\nwere modified for the configuration of a spherical lens above a plate. To do this the proximity force theorem [16] was\napplied. The coefficients to the third and fourth order terms of that expansion were first obtained in [17] for both\nconfigurations.\nIn applications to atomic force microscopy and the van der Waals force the Lifshitz formula and plasma model were\nused in [18,19] for different configurations of a tip above a plate. In [20,21], the density-functional theory along with\nthe plasma model was used in the calculation of the van der Waals force. More complicated analytical representation\nfor the dielectric permittivity (Drude model with approximate account of absorption bands) was used in [22] to\ncalculate the van der Waals force between objects covered with a chromium layer with the Lifshitz formula.\nThe parameters of plasma and Drude models (plasma wavelength, electronic relaxation frequency) are not known\nvery precisely. Due to this in [23] the attempt was undertaken to apply Lifshitz formalism numerically to gold,\ncopper, and aluminum (see also [24]). The tabulated data for the frequency dependent complex refractive index of\nthese metals were used together with the dispersion relation to calculate the values of dielectric permittivity on the\nimaginary frequency axis. Thereupon the Casimir force was calculated in [23] for configurations of two plates and a\nspherical lens above a plate in a distance range from 0.05 \u03bcm to 2.5 \u03bcm. The same computation based on Lifshitz\nformalism and optical tabulated data for the dielectric permittivity was repeated in [25] in a distance range from\n0.1 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm. The two sets of results are in disagreement (see also [26]). Note that the higher-order perturbative\ncalculations of [17] in their application range are in agreement with [25,26] but also disagree with [23,24].\nIn this paper we present a brief derivation of the van der Waals and Casimir energy density and force between\ntwo parallel metallic plates or a plate and a sphere covered by the thin layers of another metal (the configuration\nused in the experiments [4,8]). Two plates of sufficient thickness can be modelled by two semi-spaces with some gap\nbetween them. The case of multilayered plane walls was considered in [27]. In contrast to [27] where the removal\nof the infinities of the zero-point energy was not considered, we present explicitly the details of the regularization\nprocedure and its physical justification. We next perform an independent computation using optical tabulated data\nfor the frequency dependent complex refractive index of aluminum and gold with the goal to resolve the disagreement\nbetween earlier results. Our results turn out to be in agreement with [25,26] with a precision of computational error\nless than 1%. Also the influence of the thin covering metallic layers onto the Casimir force is determined. The range\nof applicability and exceptions to using the bulk metal optical data for the dielectric permittivity of the thin metallic\nlayers is discussed. For smaller distances the intermediate (transition) region between the Casimir and van der Waals\nforces is examined. It is shown that the transition region is very wide ranging from several nanometers to hundreds of\nnanometers. The pure van der Waals regime for aluminum and gold is restricted to separations in the interval from\n0.5 nm till (2\u20134) nm only. The more exact values of the Hamaker constant for aluminum and gold are determined\nwith the use of obtained computational data.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the general formalism is briefly presented giving the Casimir and van\nder Waals forces including the effect of covering layers on the surface of interacting bodies (two plates or a sphere\nabove a plate). In Sec. III the influence of finite conductivity of the metal onto the Casimir force is reexamined.\nSec. IV contains the calculation of the Casimir force between the aluminum surfaces covered by the thin gold layers.\nIn Sec. V the van der Waals force is calculated in both configurations and the transition region to the Casimir is\nexamined. Sec. VI contains determination of the Hamaker constant values for aluminum and gold. In Sec. VII\nwe present conclusions and discussion, in particular, of possible applications of the obtained results in experimental\ninvestigations of the Casimir force and for obtaining stronger constraints on the constants of hypothetical long-range\ninteractions.\nII. THE VAN DER WAALS AND CASIMIR FORCE BETWEEN LAYERED SURFACES: GENERAL\nFORMALISM\n\nWe consider first two semi-spaces bounded by planes (x, y) and filled with material having a frequency-dependent\ndielectric permittivity \u03b52 (\u03c9). Let the planes bounding the semi-spaces be covered by layers of thickness d made of\nthe another material with a dielectric permittivity \u03b51 (\u03c9). The magnetic permeabilities of both materials are taken to\n\n2\n\n\fbe equal to unity. The region of thickness a between the layers (see Fig. 1) is empty space. According to [28,29] van\nder Waals and Casimir forces for the configuration under consideration can be found by consideration of the surface\nmodes for which divE = 0, curlE = 0.

This is the reason why (3) does not coincide with the corresponding equations of\n[5,27] where some transformations were used which are not equivalent in the limit |\u03c9| \u2192 \u221e (see below).\nSummation in (2) over the solutions of (3) can be performed with the help of the argument principle which was\napplied for this purpose in [28].

For this reason the sum over their poles is absent\nfrom (5).\nThe second integral in the right-hand side of (5) is simply calculated with the natural supposition that\nlim \u03b5\u03b1 (\u03c9) = 1,\n\nlim\n\n\u03c9\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c9\u2192\u221e\n\nd\u03b5\u03b1 (\u03c9)\n=0\nd\u03c9\n\nalong any radial direction in complex \u03c9-plane.

To remove the divergences we use the regularization procedure\nwhich goes back to the original Casimir paper [30] (see also [6,28]).

Thus in [5] no finite expression for the energy density is presented for two semi-spaces. In [27]\nthe omission of infinities is performed implicitly, namely instead of Eqs. (3) the result of their division by the terms\ncontaining exp(R0 a) was presented. The coefficient near exp(R0 a), however, turns into infinity on C+ . In other words\nthe Eqs. (3) are divided by infinity. As a result the integral along C+ is equal to zero in [27] and the quantity (2)\nwould seem to be finite. Fortunately, this implicit division is equivalent to the regularization procedure explicitly\npresented above. That is why the final results obtained in [27] are indeed correct. In [11] the energy density is not\nconsidered at all.\nFrom (16) it is easy to obtain the Casimir force per unit area acting between semi-spaces covered with layers\nh\u0304\n\u2202Ereg (a, d)\n=\u2212 2 3\nFss (a, d) = \u2212\n\u2202a\n2\u03c0 c\n\nZ\u221e\n\n2\n\np dp\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u03be 3 d\u03be\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n1 \u2212 Q1 (i\u03be) 1 \u2212 Q2 (i\u03be)\n.\n+\nQ1 (i\u03be)\nQ2 (i\u03be)\n\n(19)\n\nThis expression coincides with Lifshitz result [9\u201311] for the force per unit area between semi-spaces with a dielectric\npermittivity \u03b52 if the covering layers are absent.

In this limit we obtain once more the results (20), (21) where K2 , \u03b52 are replaced by K1 , \u03b51 . Note also that\nwe do not take into account the effect of non-zero point temperature which is negligible for a \u226a h\u0304c/T .\nThe independent expression for the physical energy density is especially important because it allows the possibility\nto obtain approximate value of the force for the configuration of a sphere (or a spherical lens) above a semi-space.\nBoth bodies can be covered by the layers of another material. According to the proximity force theorem this force is\nh\u0304R\nFsl (a, d) = 2\u03c0REreg (a, d) =\n2\u03c0c2\n\nZ\u221e\n\np dp\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u03be 2 d\u03be [ln Q1 (i\u03be) + ln Q2 (i\u03be)] ,\n\n(22)\n\n0\n\n1\n\nwhere R is the sphere radius, Q1,2 are defined in (17). In the absence of layers Ereg (a, d) should be substituted by\nEreg (a) from (21).\nAlthough the expression (22) is not exact it allows the possibility to calculate the force with a very high accuracy.\nAs was shown in [6] (see also [31,32]) the proximity force theorem is equivalent to additive summation of interatomic\nvan der Waals and Casimir force potentials with a subsequent normalization of the interaction constant. As was\nshown in [33] the accuracy of such method is very high (the relative error of the obtained results is less than 0.01%)\nif the configuration corresponds closely with two semi-spaces which is the case for a sphere (lens) of a large radius\nR \u226b a above a semi-space.\nIn the following Sections the above general results will be used for computation of the Casimir and van der Waals\nforces acting between real metals.\n5\n\n\fIII. THE INFLUENCE OF FINITE CONDUCTIVITY ON THE CASIMIR FORCE\n\nLet us first consider semi-spaces made of aluminum or gold. Aluminum covered interacting bodies (a plate and a\nlens) were used in the experiments [4,8] because of its high reflectivity for wavelengths (plate-sphere separations) larger\nthan 100 nm. The thickness of Al covering layer was 300 nm. It is significantly greater than the effective penetration\ndepth of the electromagnetic zero point oscillations into Al which is \u03b40 = \u03bbp /(2\u03c0) \u2248 17 nm (see Introduction). That\nis why Al layer can be considered as infinitely thick and modelled by a semi-space. In the experiment [3] the test\nbodies were covered by a 500 nm Au layer which also can be considered as infinitely thick. In [4] and [8] Al surfaces\nwere covered, respectively, by d < 20 nm and d = 8 nm sputtered Au/P d layers to reduce the oxidation processes in\nAl and the effect of any associated electrostatic charges. The influence of such additional thin layers on the Casimir\nforce is discussed in Sec. IV.\nThe values of the force per unit area for the configuration of two semi-spaces and the force for a sphere above a\nsemi-space are given by Eq. (20) and Eqs. (21), (22). For the distance a much larger than the characteristic wavelength\nof absorption spectra of the semi-space material \u03bb0 Eqs. (20), (21) lead [11] to the following results in the case of ideal\nmetal (\u03b52 \u2192 \u221e)\n(0)\nFss\n(a) = \u2212\n\n\u03c0 2 h\u0304c\n,\n240 a4\n\n(0)\n\nFsl (a) = \u2212\n\n\u03c0 3 h\u0304c\nR .\n360 a3\n\n(23)\n\nTo calculate numerically the corrections to (23) due to the finite conductivity of a metal we use the tabulated data\nfor the complex index of refraction n + ik as a function of frequency [34]. The values of dielectric permittivity along\nthe imaginary axes can be expressed through Im\u03b5(\u03c9) = 2nk with the help of dispersion relation [11]\n2\n\u03b5(i\u03be) = 1 +\n\u03c0\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u03c9 Im\u03b5(\u03c9)\nd\u03c9.\n\u03c92 + \u03be2\n\n(24)\n\n0\n\nHere the complete tabulated refractive indices extending from 0.04 eV to 10000 eV for Al and from 0.1 eV to 10000 eV\nfor Au from [34] are used to calculate Im\u03b5(\u03c9). For frequencies below 0.04 eV in the case of Al and below 0.1 eV in\nthe case of Au, the table values of [34] can be extrapolated using the free electron Drude model. In this case, the\ndielectric permittivity along the imaginary axis is represented as:\n\u03b5\u03b1 (i\u03be) = 1 +\n\n2\n\u03c9p\u03b1\n,\n\u03be(\u03be + \u03b3)\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03c9p\u03b1 = (2\u03c0c)/\u03bbp\u03b1 is the plasma frequency and \u03b3 is the relaxation frequency. A \u03c9p =12.5 eV and \u03b3=0.063 eV was\nused for the case of Al based on the last results in Table XI on p.394 of [34]. In the case of Au the analysis is not\nas straightforward, but proceeding in the manner outlined in [25] we obtain \u03c9p =9.0 eV and \u03b3=0.035 eV. While the\nvalues of \u03c9p and \u03b3 based on the optical data of various sources might differ slightly we have found that the resulting\nnumerically computed Casimir forces to differ by less than 1%. In fact, if for Al metal, a \u03c9p =11.5 eV and \u03b3=0.05 eV\nas in [25] is used, the differences are extremely small. Of the values tabulated below, only the value of the force in\nthe case of a sphere and a semi-space at 0.5 \u03bcm separation is increased by 0.1% which on round-off to the second\nsignificant figure leads to an increase of 1%. The results of numerical integration by Eq. (24) for Al (solid curve) and\nAu (dashed curve) are presented in Fig.2 in a logarithmic scale. As is seen from Fig 2 the dielectric permittivity along\nthe imaginary axis decreases monotonically with increasing frequency (in distinction to Im\u03b5(\u03c9) which possesses peaks\ncorresponding to inter-band absorption).\nThe obtained values of the dielectric permittivity along the imaginary axis were substituted into Eqs. (20) and (22)\n(with account of (21)) to calculate the Casimir force acting between real metals in configurations of two semi-spaces\n(ss) and a sphere (lens) above a semi-space (sl). Numerical integration was done from an upper limit of 104 eV to a\nlower limit of 10\u22126 eV. Changes in the upper limit or lower limit by a factor of 10 lead to changes of less than 0.25% in\nthe Casimir force. If the trapezoidal rule is used in the numerical integration of Eqs. (24) the corresponding Casimir\nforce decreases by a factor less than 0.5%. The results are presented in Fig. 3(a) (two semi-spaces) and in Fig. 3(b) for\na sphere above a semi-space by the solid lines 1 (material of the test bodies is aluminum) and 2 (material is gold). In\n(0)\n(0)\nthe vertical axis the relative force Fss /Fss is plotted in Fig. 3(a) and Fsl /Fsl in Fig. 3(b). These quantities provide\na sense of the correction factors to the Casimir force due to the effect of finite conductivity. In the horizontal axis\nthe space separation is plotted in the range 0.1\u20131 \u03bcm. We do not present the results for larger distances because the\ntemperature corrections to the Casimir force become significant. At room temperature the temperature corrections\n(0)\n(0)\ncontribute only 2.6% of Fsl at a = 1 \u03bcm, but at a = 3 \u03bcm they contribute 47% of Fsl , and at a = 5 \u03bcm - 129% of\n6\n\n\f(0)\n\nFsl [35]. It is seen that the relative force for Al is larger than for Au at the same separations as it should be because\nof better reflectivity properties of Al.\nIt is interesting to compare the obtained results with those of Refs. [23,24] and [25,26] where the similar computations\nwere performed (in [25,26] the analytical expressions equivalent to Eqs. (20) and (21) were used, in [23,24], however,\nthe energy density between plates was obtained by a numerical integration of the force which can lead to some\nadditional error). All the results for the several values of distance between the test bodies are presented in the Table\n1.\nTABLE I.

The\nresults for Al are presented in [23] at a = 0.1 \u03bcm only. Note that the results at a = 3 \u03bcm (the last four lines of\nthe Table 1) are valid only at zero temperature. They do not take into account temperature corrections which are\nsignificant for such separation. Also the results of [23,24] for Cu covered bodies are in disagreement with [25,26]. We\ndo not consider Cu here because the outer surfaces in the recent experiments were covered by the thick layers of Au\n[3] and Al [4,8]. The hypothesis of [24] that the Au film of 0.5 \u03bcm thickness could significantly diffuse into the Cu\nlayer of the same thickness at room temperatures seems unlikely. In any case it is not needed because the dielectric\npermittivity of Au and Cu along the imaginary axis is almost the same [17,25,26] and, consequently, will also lead to\nthe same Casimir force.\nThe computational results obtained here are in good agreement with analytical perturbation expansions of the\nCasimir force in powers of relative penetration depth \u03b40 = \u03bbp /(2\u03c0) of the electromagnetic zero point oscillations into\nthe metal. Representation (25) with \u03b3 = 0 is applicable for the wavelengths (space separations) larger than \u03bbp\u03b1 (the\ncorrections due to relaxation processes are small for the distances a \u2264 5 \u03bcm). It can be substituted into Eqs. (20),\n(21) to get the perturbation expansion. According to the results of Ref.

THE CASIMIR FORCE BETWEEN LAYERED\nSURFACES\n\nIn this Section we consider the influence of the thin outer metallic layers on the Casimir force value. Let the\nsemi-space made of Al (\u03b52 ) be covered by Au (\u03b51 ) layers as shown in Fig. 1. For a configuration of a sphere above a\nplate such covering made of Au/P d was used in experiments [4,8] with different values of layer thickness d. In this\ncase the Casimir force is given by the Eqs. (19), (22), where the quantities Q1,2 (i\u03be) are expressed by Eqs. (17), (18).\nThe computational results for \u03b5\u03b1 (i\u03be) are obtained in the previous Section by Eq. (24). Substituting them into (19),\n(22) and performing a numerical integration in the same way as above one obtains the Casimir force including the\neffect of covering layers. The computational results for a configuration of two semi-spaces are shown in Fig. 4(a). Here\nthe solid lines represent once more the Casimir force between semi-spaces of pure Al and Au respectively, the dashed\nand dotted lines are for the case of Au layers of thickness d = 20 nm and d = 30 nm covering Al. When the layers are\npresent, the space separation a is measured from their outer surfaces according to Eqs. (19), (22). In Fig. 4(b) the\nanalogous results with the same notations are presented for the configuration of a sphere (lens) above a semi-space.\nAs is seen from Fig. 4, the Au layer of d = 20 nm thickness significantly decreases the relative Casimir force\nbetween Al surfaces. With this layer the force approaches the value for pure Au semi-spaces. For a thicker Au layer\nof d = 30 nm thickness the relative Casimir force is scarcely affected by the underlying Al. For example, at a space\n(0)\n(0)\nseparation a = 300 nm in the configuration of two semi-spaces we have Fss /Fss = 0.773 for pure Al, Fss /Fss = 0.727\n(0)\n(0)\nfor Al with 20 nm Au layer, Fss /Fss = 0.723 for Al with 30 nm Au layer, and Fss /Fss = 0.720 for pure Au. In the\n(0)\nsame way for the configuration of a sphere above a semi-space the results are: Fsl /Fsl = 0.817 (pure Al), 0.780 (Al\nwith 20 nm Au layer), 0.776 (Al with 30 nm Au layer), 0.774 (pure Au). Both limiting cases d \u2192 \u221e and d \u2192 0 were\nconsidered and the results are shown to coincide with that of Sec. III.\nLet us now discuss the application range of the obtained results for the case of covering layers. First from a\ntheoretical standpoint, the main question concerns the layer thicknesses to which the obtained formulas (19), (22)\nand the above computations can be applied. In the derivation of Sec. II the spatial dispersion is neglected and, as a\nconsequence, the dielectric permittivities \u03b5\u03b1 depend only on \u03c9 not on the wave vector k. In other words the field of\nvacuum oscillations is considered as time-dependent but space homogeneous. Except for the thickness of a skin layer\n\u03b40 the main parameters of our problem are the velocity of the electrons on the Fermi surface vF , the characteristic\nfrequency of the oscillation field \u03c9, and the mean free path of the electrons l. For the considered region of high\nfrequencies (micrometer distances between the test bodies) the following conditions are valid [36]\nvF\n< \u03b40 \u226a l.\n\u03c9\n\n(28)\n\nNote that the quantity vF /\u03c9 in the left-hand side of Eq. (28) is the distance travelled by an electron during one period\nof the field, so that the first inequality is equivalent to the assumption of spatial homogeneity of the oscillating field.\nUsually the corresponding frequencies start from the far infrared part of spectrum which means the space separation\na \u223c 100 \u03bcm [6]. The region of high frequencies is restricted by the short-wave optical or near ultraviolet parts of the\nspectrum which correspond to the surface separations of several hundred nanometers. For smaller distances absorption\nbands, photoelectric effect and other physical phenomena should be taken into account. For these phenomena, the\ngeneral Eqs. (19), (22), however, are still valid if one substitutes the experimental tabulated data for the dielectric\npermittivity along the imaginary axis incorporating all these phenomena.\nNow let us include one more physical parameter - the thickness d of the additional, i.e. Au, covering layer. It is\nevident that Eqs. (19), (22) are applicable only for layers of such thickness that\nvF\n< d.\n\u03c9\n\n(29)\n\nOtherwise an electron goes out of the thin layer during one period of the oscillating field and the approximation of\nspace homogeneity is not valid. If d is so small that the inequality (29) is violated the spatial dispersion should be\ntaken into account which means that the dielectric permittivity would depend not only on frequency but on a wave\nvector also: \u03b51 = \u03b51 (\u03c9, k). So, if (29) is violated the situation is analogous to the anomalous skin effect where only\nspace dispersion is important and the inequalities below are valid\n\u03b40 (\u03c9) <\n\nvF\n,\n\u03c9\n\n\u03b40 (\u03c9) < l.\n\n(30)\n\nIn our case, however, the role of \u03b40 is played by the layer thickness d (the influence of nonlocality effects on van der\nWaals force is discussed in [37,38]).\n8\n\n\fFrom (28), (29) it follows that for pure Au layers (\u03bbp \u2248 136 nm) the space dispersion can be neglected only if\nd \u2265 (25 \u2212 30) nm. For thinner layers a more general theory taking into account nonlocal effects should be developed to\ncalculate the Casimir force. Thus for such thin layers the bulk tabulated data of the dielectric permittivity depending\nonly on frequency cannot be used (see experimental investigation [39] demonstrating that for Au the bulk values of\ndielectric constants can only be obtained from films whose thickness is about 30 nm or more). That is why the dashed\nlines in Fig. 4 (d = 20 nm layers) are subject to corrections due to the influence of spatial dispersion, whereas the solid\nlines represent the final result. From an experimental standpoint thin layers of order a few nm grown by evaporation\nor sputtering techniques are highly porous. This is particularly so in the case of sputtered coatings as shown in [40].\nThe nature of porosity is a function of the material and the underlying substrate. Thus it should be noted that the\ntheory presented here which used the bulk tabulated data for \u03b51 cannot be applied to calculate the influence of thin\ncovering layers of d < 20 nm [4,7] and of d = 8 nm [8,41] on the Casimir force. The measured high transparency of\nsuch layers for the characteristic frequencies [4,7] corresponds to a larger change of the force than what follows from\nthe Eqs. (19), (22). This is in agreement with the above qualitative analyses.\nThe role of spatial dispersion was also neglected in the paper [42] where an attempt was made to describe theoretically the influence of thin metallic covering layers onto the Casimir force in experiments [4,8]. Also the bulk materials\nproperties were used for the Au/P d films. As shown in [43], the resistivity of sputtered Au/P d films even of 60nm\nthickness have been shown to be extremely high of order 2000 ohm*cm. In [42] it was concluded that the maximum\npossible theoretical values of the force including the covering layers is significantly smaller than the measured ones.\nThe data of [4,8] is however shown to be consistent with a theory neglecting the influence of layers. In [4,8] the surface\nseparations are calculated from Al surfaces. Including the thickness of covering layers reduces the distance between\nthe outer surfaces which is now smaller than the distance between Al surfaces. Thus contrary to [42], the theoretical\nvalue of force should increase when the presence of the layers is included. The error made in [42] can be traced to the\nfollowing. The authors of [42] changed the data of [8] \"by shifting all the points to larger separations on 2h = 16 nm\"\n(where h = 8 nm is the layer thickness in [8]) instead of shifting to smaller separations by 16nm as based on [8]. If the\ncorrect shift is done then the theoretical values of the force, including the effect of covering layers, are not smaller than\nthe experimental values. Hence the conclusion in [42] about the probable influence of new hypothetical attractions\nbased on the experiments [4,8] is unsubstantiated.\n\nV. THE VAN DER WAALS FORCE AND INTERMEDIATE REGION\n\nAs is seen from Figs. 3,4 at room temperature the Casimir force does not follow its ideal field-theoretical expressions\n(23). For the space separations less than a = 1 \u03bcm the corrections due to finite conductivity of the metal are rather\nlarge (thus, at a = 1 \u03bcm they are around 7\u20139% for a lens above a semi-space, and 10\u201312% for two semi-spaces; at\na = 0.1 \u03bcm - around 38\u201344% (sl), and 45\u201352% (ss)). For a > 1 \u03bcm the temperature corrections increase very quickly\n(see Sec. III). Actually, the range presented in Figs. 3,4 is the beginning of a transition with decreasing a from the\nCasimir force to the van der Waals force. Our aim is to investigate the intermediate region in more detail for smaller\na and to find values of a where the pure (non-retarded) van der Waals regime starts. To do this for the case when no\nadditional covering layers are present we numerically evaluate the integrals in Eqs. (20)\u2013(22) for a < 100 nm.\nThe computational results obtained by the same procedures as in Sec. III are presented in Fig. 5(a) for two semispaces and 5(b) for a sphere above a semi-space. In both Figs. the solid line represents the results for aluminum test\nbodies, and the dashed line for gold ones. The absolute values of the van der Waals force and surface separation a\nare plotted along the vertical and horizontal axes in a logarithmic scale. The asymptotic expressions in the limit of\na \u226a \u03bb0 following from Eqs. (20)\u2013(22) respectively are [11]\n(0)\nFss\n(a) = \u2212\n\nH\n,\n6\u03c0a3\n\n(0)\n\nFsl (a) = \u2212\n\nHR\n.\n6a2\n\n(31)\n\nHere it is important to note that the Hamaker constant H is dependent on the material properties of the boundaries\nand is a priori unknown. This is in contrast to the ideal Casimir force limit of Eq. (23) (obtained for a \u226b \u03bb0 ) which is\nmaterial independent and is only a function of h\u0304 and c. Thus it is not reasonable to express the van der Waals force\nas a ratio relative to Eq. (31). The asymptotic behavior (31) will be used below to determine the value of H.\nThe computations were performed with a step \u2206a = 5 nm in the interval 10 nm\u2264 a \u2264 100 nm, \u2206a = 1 nm in the\ninterval 4 nm\u2264 a \u2264 10 nm, \u2206a = 0.2 nm in the interval 2 nm\u2264 a \u2264 4 nm, and \u2206a = 0.1 nm for 0.5 nm\u2264 a \u2264 2 nm. At\na = 100 nm the force values coincide with those in Fig. 3. For a < 0.5 nm the repulsive exchange forces dominate.\nAs is seen from Fig. 5 for both configurations and two metals under consideration (Al and Au) the range of purely\nvan der Waals force described by Eqs. (31) turn out to be extremely narrow. It extends from 0.5 nm till 2\u20134 nm only.\nFor larger distances the transition from the force-distance dependence \u223c a\u22123 to the dependence \u223c a\u22124 begins (for\n9\n\n\ftwo semi-spaces) and from the dependence \u223c a\u22122 to \u223c a\u22123 (for a lens above a semi-space). This conclusion is in a\nqualitative agreement with the results of [18] where the van der Waals force between a metallic sample and a metallic\ntip of the atomic force microscope was calculated (our choice of a sphere is formally equivalent to the paraboloidal\ntip considered in [18]). Calculation in [18] was performed by numerical integration of Lifshitz-type equation for the\nforce with the permittivity of a metal given by the plasma model [Eq.(25) with \u03b3 = 0]. Strictly speaking plasma\nmodel is not applicable for a \u226a \u03bb0 (see Sec. III). That is why we have used the optical tabulated data for the complex\nrefractive index in our computations. However, the correct conclusion about the extremely narrow distance range\nof the purely van der Waals region for metals is obtainable by using the plasma model to represent their dielectric\nproperties. Note that for dielectric test bodies the pure van der Waals regime extends to larger distances. For example\nin the configuration of two crossed mica cylinders (which is formally equivalent to a sphere above a semi-space) the\nvan der Waals regime extends from 1.4 nm till 12 nm as was experimentally shown in [44].\nVI. DETERMINATION OF HAMAKER CONSTANTS FOR AL AND AU\n\nThe results of the previous Sec. make it possible to determine the values of the Hamaker constant H from Eq.(31)\nfor aluminum and gold. Let us start with the configuration of two semi-spaces. As is seen from the computational\nresults presented in Fig. 5(a) (solid curve) the asymptotic regime for Al extends here from a = 0.5 nm till a = 4 nm.\nWe use a more narrow interval 0.5 nm\u20132 nm for the determination of n and H. The power index n of the force-distance\nrelation given by the first formula of Eq. (31) is equal to n = 3.02 \u00b1 0.01 in the considered interval. To obtain this\nvalue the slopes between adjacent points, i.e. (0.5\u20130.6) nm, (0.6\u20130.7) nm etc were calculated and then the average and\nthe standard deviation were found. The corresponding mean value of the Hamaker constant is\nAl\nHss\n= (3.67 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10\u221219 J.\n\n(32)\n\nConsidering the computational results for Au (dashed curve of Fig. 5(a)) we find the asymptotic regime in a more\nnarrow interval 0.5 nm \u2013 2 nm with the power index n = 3.04 \u00b1 0.02. The mean value of the Hamaker constant turns\nout to be equal to\nAu\nHss\n= (4.49 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10\u221219 J.\n\n(33)\n\nFor the configuration of a sphere (lens) above a semi-space the results are presented in Fig. 5(b) (solid curve for Al\nand dashed curve for Au). In both cases the asymptotic region extends from a = 0.5 nm till a = 2 nm only with the\nmean values of power index in the second formula of Eq. (31) n = 2.04 \u00b1 0.02 (Al) and n = 2.08 \u00b1 0.03 (Au). The\ncorresponding mean values of the Hamaker constant are\nAl\nHsl\n= (3.60 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10\u221219 J,\n\nAu\nHsl\n= (4.31 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d7 10\u221219 J.\n\n(34)\n\nIt is seen that in the case of Au and a sphere above a semi-space configuration the behavior of the force shows less\nprecise agreement with the second formula of Eq. (31).\nThe above results obtained for the two configurations independently give the possibility to derive new values of the\nHamaker constant for Al and Au. Taking into account the value of (32) and the first expression from (34) we get\nH Al = (3.6 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u221219 J.\n\n(35)\n\nThe absolute error here was chosen in such a way to cover both permitted intervals in (32) and (34).\nFor Au the tolerances of the second value from (34) are two times wider than the permitted interval from (33).\nThat is why the most probable final value of the Hamaker constant for gold can be estimated as\nH Au = (4.4 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u221219 J.\n\n(36)\n\nThe decreased accuracy than in (35) is explained by the extremely narrow region of pure van der Waals force law for\ngold. These values of H for gold are compatible with those obtained previously. For example, in [45] values between\n(2 \u2212 4) \u00d7 10\u221219 J were obtained using different procedures.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn the above, general expressions were obtained both for the Casimir energy density and force in the configuration of\ntwo plates (semi-spaces) with different separations between them. The case of where the surfaces were covered by the\n10\n\n\fthin layers made of the another material was also considered. Additional clarifications of the regularization procedure\nwere given. This is important for obtaining a finite physical value for the energy density. The latter quantity is very\nimportant for obtaining the Casimir force for the configuration of a sphere (lens) above a plate (semi-space) which\nwas used in the recent experiments. For this configuration the general expression for the Casimir force with account\nof layers covering a lens and a semi-space was arrived at by the use of proximity force theorem.\nThe Casimir force was recalculated between Al and Au test bodies for the configurations of two semi-spaces and a\nsphere (lens) above a semi-space. The disagreement between the results of [23,24] and [25,26] was resolved in favor\nof [25,26]. Additionally, computational results were compared with perturbation expansion up to the fourth order in\npowers of relative penetration depth of electromagnetic zero point oscillations into the metal. The perturbation results\nare also in agreement with [25,26] and our computations for the space separations larger than a plasma wavelength\nof the metal under study (not much larger as it to be expected from general considerations). We have performed the\nfirst computations of the Casimir force between Al test bodies covered by Au thin layers. The monotonous decrease\nof the correction factor to the Casimir force was observed with increase of the layer thickness. The qualitative analysis\nleads to the conclusion that the thickness of the layer should be large enough to allow neglect of the spatial dispersion\nof the dielectric permittivity and the use of bulk optical tabulated data for the complex refractive index. For the Au\nlayers the minimal allowed thickness for such an approximation was estimated as d = 30 nm in agreement with the\nexperimental evidence of [39]. For smaller layer thicknesses the bulk optical tabulated data cannot be used. In this\ncase the calculation of the Casimir force would require a direct measurement of the complex refractive index for the\nparticular metal (not only the frequency dependence but also its dependence on the wave vector).\nThe van der Waals force was calculated between the Al and Au test bodies in configurations of two semi-spaces and\na sphere (lens) above a semi-space. The computations were performed starting from the same general expressions as\nin the case of the Casimir force and using the same numerical procedure and optical tabulated data. The extremely\nnarrow region where the pure non-retarded van der Waals power-law force acts was noted. This region extends from\na = 0.5 nm till a = (2 \u2212 4) nm only. For larger distances a wide transition region starts, where the non-retarded van\nder Waals force described by the Eq. (31) gradually transforms into the retarded van der Waals (Casimir) force from\nthe Eq. (23) when the space separation approaches the value a = 1 \u03bcm. The values of the Casimir force given by the\nEq. (31) are never achieved at room temperature (at a = 1 \u03bcm due to the finite conductivity of the metal while for\nlarger distances the temperature corrections make a strong contribution). Using the asymptotic region of the pure\nnon-retarded van der Waals force the new values of the Hamaker constant for Al and Au were obtained. For Al the\nreported accuracy corresponds to a relative error of 2.8%, and for Au it is around 4.5%.\nThe obtained results do not exhaust all the problems connected with the role of finite conductivity of the metal in\nthe precision measurements of the Casimir force. The main problem to be solved is the investigation of corrections\nto the force due to thin covering layers. This would demand theoretical work on the generalization of the Lifshitz\nformalism for the case when the spatial dispersion can be important in addition to the frequency dependence. Also\nthe new measurements of the complex refractive index are needed for the layers under consideration. What's more\nthe finite conductivity corrections to the Casimir force should be considered together with the corrections due to the\nsurface roughness (see, e.g., [7] where the non-additivity of both influential factors is demonstrated) and corrections\ndue to finite temperature. This combined research is necessary for both applied and fundamental applications of the\nCasimir effect. It has been known that the measurements of the Casimir force give the possibility to obtain strong\nconstraints for the constants of long-range interactions and light elementary particles predicted by the unified gauge\ntheories, supersymmetry and supergravity [6]. Such information is unique and cannot be obtained even by means of\nthe most powerful modern accelerators. In Ref. [35] the constraints for the Yukawa-type hypothetical interactions\nwere strengthened up to 30 times in some distance range on the base of Casimir force measurements of Ref. [3]. The\nincreased precision of the Casimir force in [4] gave the possibility to strengthen constraints up to 140 times on the\nYukawa-type interactions at smaller distances [46]. It is highly probable that the new measurements of the Casimir\nforce with increased accuracy will serve as an important alternative source of information about the elementary\nparticles and fundamental interactions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nG.L.K. and V.M.M. are grateful to the Department of Physics of the Federal University of Paraiba, where this work\nwas partly done, for their hospitality.\n\n11\n\n\f[1] D.
