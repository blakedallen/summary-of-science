We present preliminary results of the analysis of 5 years\nof MACHO data on the Galactic bulge microlensing events with clump\ngiants as sources. This class of events allows one to obtain robust conclusions because relatively bright clump stars are not strongly affected by\nblending. We discuss: 1) the selection of 'giant' events, 2) the distribution of event durations, 3) the anomalous character of event durations and\noptical depth in the MACHO field 104 centered on (l, b) = (3.\u25e6 1, \u22123.\u25e6 0).\nWe report the preliminary average optical depth of \u03c4 = (2.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22126\n(internal) at (l, b) = (3.\u25e6 9, \u22123.\u25e6 8), and present a map of the spatial distribution of the optical depth. When field 104 is removed from the sample,\nthe optical depth drops to \u03c4 = (1.4 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22126 , which is in excellent\nagreement with infrared-based models of the central Galactic region.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe structure and composition of our Galaxy is one of the outstanding problems\nin contemporary astrophysics. Microlensing is a powerful tool to learn about\nmassive objects in the Galaxy. The amount of matter between the source and\nobserver is typically described in terms of the microlensing optical depth, which\nis defined as the probability that a source flux will be gravitationally magnified\nby more than a factor of 1.34. Early analyses (Udalski et al. 1994; Alcock et al.\n1997) of the lines of sight toward the Galactic center produced two unexpected\nresults: 1) a very high optical depth of 3 \u2212 4 \u00d7 10\u22126 inconsistent with Galactic\nmodels and observations, 2) an overabundance of long events. Here we analyze\na new set of events to probe these controversial issues.\nBlending is a major problem in any analysis of the microlensing data involving point spread function photometry. The bulge fields are crowded, so that\nthe objects observed at a certain atmospheric seeing are blends of several stars,\nof which only one is typically lensed. This complicates a determination of an\nevent's parameters and the analysis of the detection efficiency of microlensing\nevents. If the sources are bright one can avoid these problems. Red clump giants\nare among the brightest and most numerous stars in the bulge. Therefore, this\nanalysis concentrates on the events where the lensed stars are clump giants.\n1\n\n\fBulge Clump Microlensing\n2.\n\n2\n\nThe Data and Selection of \"Giant\" Events\n\nThe MACHO Project observations were performed with 1.27-meter telescope at\nMount Stromlo Observatory, Australia. In total, we collected 7 seasons (19931999) of data in the 94 Galactic bulge fields. The data that are currently available for the analysis consist of 5 seasons (1993-1997) in 77 fields, and contain\nthe photometry of about 30 million stars, including 2.1 million clump giants.\nThe events with clump giants as sources have been selected from the sample\nof all events which contains about \u223c 280 candidates. The determination of\nwhich of these sources are clump giants, is investigated through the analysis of\nthe global properties of the color-magnitude diagram in the Galactic bulge.\nUsing the accurately measured extinction towards Baade's Window allows\none to locate bulge clump giants on the reddening-free color-magnitude diagram.\nThis defines the parallelogram-shaped box in the upper left corner of the left\npanel of Figure 1. With the assumption that the clump populations in the\nwhole bulge have the same properties as the ones in the Baade's Window, the\nparallelogram described above can be shifted by the reddening vector to mark\nthe expected locations of clump giants in different fields. The solid lines are the\nboundaries of the region where one could find the clump giants in fields with\ndifferent extinctions. Using this approach, we identified 52 clump events.\n3.\n\nField 104\n\nThere is a high concentration of long-duration events in MACHO field 104 at\n(l, b) = (3.\u25e6 1, \u22123.\u25e6 0) as 5 out of 10 clump events longer than 50 days are in 104.\nThe analysis of event durations uncorrected for efficiencies provides a lower limit\non the difference between field 104 and all the other fields. We use the Wilcoxon's\ntest on two samples: events in field 104 and all the remaining ones, and find\nthat the events in 104 differ (are longer) at the level of 2.55\u03c3. In addition, field\n104 also has the highest optical depth (see Figure 1). Both of these features can\nbe explained by the concentration of mass along this particular line of sight.\n4.\n\nOptical Depth\n\nFirst, we report the average optical depth of:\n\u03c4 = (2.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22126\n\nat\n\n(l, b) = (3.\u25e6 9, \u22123.\u25e6 8),\n\nwhich is 1.5-2 times lower than the previously obtained values. We caution that\nthis result is only preliminary, because possible systematic errors may be a fair\nfraction of the statistical error. We also note that about 40% of the optical depth\nis in the events longer than 50 days. This is at odds with standard models of\nthe Galactic structure and kinematics.\nSecond, we plot in the right panel of Figure 1 the spatial distribution of the\noptical depth. The variation of the optical depth is dominated by the Poisson\nnoise. The gradient of the optical depth is stronger in b than in l direction.\nAgain, we note the anomalous character of field 104. It is marked with a black\nsquare and has an optical depth of (1.4 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\n\fBulge Clump Microlensing\n\n3\n\nAlcock et al. (1997) clump region\n\nFigure 1.\nLeft panel: Events are marked with filled triangles. The\nregion surrounded by a bold line is our clump region. For comparison,\nwe plot with a dotted line the clump region from Alcock et al. (1997).\nBoth selections return very similar events. Right panel: The spatial\ndistribution of optical depth with the numbers of events given in the\ncenter of each field. Note anomalous field 104 with 10 events and optical\ndepth of (1.4 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe presented first results from the analysis of five years of microlensing data\ntoward the Galactic bulge collected by the MACHO Collaboration.\nIt is possible to select an unbiased sample of clump events based only on an\nevent's position on the color-magnitude diagram. Ten out of 52 clump events\nhave durations > 50 days, which implies that \u223c 40% of the optical depth is in the\nlong events. This is surprising, because long events are the most likely a result\nof the disk-disk lensing (Kiraga & Paczy\u0144ski 1994), while clump giants trace\nthe bar rather than the inner disk (Stanek et al. 1994). Field 104 centered on\n(l, b) = (3.\u25e6 1, \u22123.\u25e6 0) is anomalous: it has longer events and substantially higher\noptical depth. Both effects can be explained simultaneously by a concentration\nof mass along this line of sight. The optical depth averaged over the clump\ngiants in 77 fields is \u03c4 = (2.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22126 at (3.\u25e6 9, \u22123.\u25e6 8). When anomalous field\n104 is removed, the optical depth drops to \u03c4 = (1.4 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22126 , which is fully\nconsistent with infrared-based models of the Galactic bar.\nReferences\nAlcock, C., et al. 1997, ApJ, 479, 119\nKiraga, M., & Paczy\u0144ski, B. 1994, ApJ, 430, L101\nStanek, K.Z., et al. 1994, ApJ, 429, L73\nUdalski, A., et al. 1994, Acta Astron., 44, 165\n\n\f"}
