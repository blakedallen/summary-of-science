When\npolarized light is incident on an optically random medium it suffers multiple scattering and,\nas a result, it may emerge partly or completely depolarized. The amount of depolarization\ncan be quantified by calculating either the entropy (EF ) or the degree of polarization (PF )\nof the scattered field [2]. It is simple to show that the field quantities EF and PF are related\nby a single-valued function: EF (PF ). For example polarized light (PF = 1) has EF = 0\nwhile partially polarized light (0 \u2264 PF < 1) has 1 \u2265 EF > 0. When the incident beam is\npolarized and the output beam is partially polarized, the medium is said to be depolarizing.\nAn average measure of the depolarizing power of the medium is given by the so called index\nof depolarization (DM ) [3]. Non-depolarizing media are characterized by DM = 1, while\ndepolarizing media have 0 \u2264 DM < 1. A depolarizing scattering process is always accompanied by an increase of the entropy of the light, the increase being due to the interaction of\nthe field with the medium. An average measure of the entropy that a given random medium\ncan add to the entropy of the incident light beam, is given by the polarization entropy EM\n[4]. Non-depolarizing media are characterized by EM = 0, while for depolarizing media\n0 < EM \u2264 1. As the field quantities EF and PF are related to each other, so are the medium\nquantities EM and DM . In a previous paper [5] we showed the existence of a universal\nrelation EM (DM ) between the polarization entropy EM and the index of depolarization DM\nvalid for any scattering medium. More specifically, EM is related to DM by a multi-valued\nfunction, which covers the complete regime from zero to total depolarization. This universal\nrelation provides a simple characterization of the polarization properties of any medium, as\nwell as a consistency check for the experimentally measured Mueller matrices. We emphasize\nthat the results found in [5] apply both to classical and quantum scattering processes, and\nmight therefore become relevant for quantum communication optical applications, where\ndepolarization is due to the loss of quantum coherence [7].\nIn this contribution, we present an experimental study of the depolarizing properties of a\nlarge set of scattering media, ranging from milk to multi-mode optical fibers. The results\nconfirm the theoretical predictions for the bounds of the multi-valued function EM (DM ).\nThe manuscript is divided as follows: in Section II we review the Mueller-Stokes formalism\n2\n\n\fand show the differences between deterministic (non-depolarizing) and non-deterministic\n(depolarizing) scattering media. We also discuss the statistical nature of a depolarizing\nprocess resulting from the average (either spatial or temporal) performed in a multi-mode\ndetection scheme. Furthermore, in order to describe the transverse spatial average present in\nour multi-mode detection set-up, we formally introduce the concept of an effective Mueller\nmatrix (Meff ). In Section III we describe the experimental scheme for polarization tomography that was used to characterize the different scattering samples. These can be divided\ninto two categories: (a) non-stationary (samples which fluctuate during the measurement\ntime) and (b) stationary (samples which do not fluctuate). We then show the experimental\nresults obtained for these samples followed by a brief discussion of the interesting structures\nin the (EM , DM ) plane, that were revealed by the experiments. Finally, in Section IV we\ndraw our conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nDEPOLARIZING AND NON-DEPOLARIZING MEDIA\n\nIn the Introduction we stressed the fact that passive optical systems may be grouped\nin two broad classes: depolarizing and non-depolarizing systems. To the first class belong\nall media which decrease the degree of polarization PF of the impinging light, while to the\nsecond one belong all media which do not decrease PF . In this Section we want to make the\ndiscussion more quantitative by using the Mueller-Stokes formalism which is widely used for\nthe description of the polarization state of light beams.\n\nA.\n\nMueller-Stokes formalism\n\nConsider a quasi-monochromatic beam of light of mean angular frequency \u03c9 [6]. Let\nus denote with x, y, z the axes of a Cartesian coordinate system, with the z-axis along the\ndirection of propagation of the beam whose angular spread around z is assumed to be small\nenough to satisfy the paraxial approximation. Let\nEx (x, y, z0 , t0 ) \u2261 E0 e\u2212i\u03c9t0 ,\n\nEy (x, y, z0, t0 ) \u2261 E1 e\u2212i\u03c9t0 ,\n\n(1)\n\nbe the component of the complex paraxial electric field vector in the x- and y-direction\nrespectively, at the point (x, y) located in the transverse plane z = z0 at time t0 . If the field\n3\n\n\fis uniform on the transverse plane, then Ex and Ey will be, in fact, independent of x and y\nand a complete description of the field can be achieved in terms of a doublets E of complex\nvariables (with possibly stochastic fluctuations):\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\nE0\nE = \uf8ed \uf8f8,\nE1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E0 and E1 are now complex-valued functions of z0 and t0 only. A complete study of\n\nthe propagation of E along z can be found, e.g., in [8], however, for our purposes the main\nresult we need is that propagation through non-depolarizing media can be described by a\ndeterministic Mueller (or Mueller-Jones) matrix M J , while to describe the propagation of a\nlight beam through a depolarizing medium it is necessary to use a non-deterministic Mueller\nmatrix M.\n\n1.\n\nDeterministic Mueller matrix M J\n\nIn a wide-sense, a deterministic linear scatterer as, e.g., a quarter-wave plate, a rotator\nor a polarizer, is an optical system which can be described by a 2 \u00d7 2 complex Jones [2]\nmatrix\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nJ00 J01\n\uf8f8.\nJ =\uf8ed\nJ10 J11\n\n(3)\n\nWith this we mean that if E and E\u2032 describe the polarization state of the field immediately\nbefore and immediately after the scatterer respectively, then they are linearly related by the\nmatrix J:\nE\u2032 = JE.\n\n(4)\n\nAn alternative description can be given in terms of the Stokes parameters of the beam. To\nthis end let C be the covariance matrix of the field defined as [9]\nCij = hEi Ej\u2217 i,\n\n(i, j = 0, 1),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the brackets denote the statistical average over different realizations of the random\nfluctuations of the field. Then the four Stokes parameters S\u03bc (\u03bc = 0, . . . , 3) of the beam are\ndefined as\nS\u03bc = Tr{C\u03c3\u03bc },\n\n(\u03bc = 0, . . . , 3),\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\fwere the symbol Tr{*} denote the trace operation and the {\u03c3\u03bc } are the normalized Pauli\nmatrices:\n\n\uf8eb\n1\n\u03c30 = \u221a12 \uf8ed\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\uf8f8,\n1\n\n\u03c31 =\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n\u2212i\n\uf8f8,\n\u03c32 = \u221a12 \uf8ed\ni 0\n\n\u03c33 =\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\n0 1\n1 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n(7)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\nNow, if with S\u03bc and S\u03bc\u2032 we denotes the Stokes parameters of the beam before and after the\nscatterer respectively, it is easy to show that that they are linearly related by the real-valued\n4 \u00d7 4 Mueller-Jones matrix M J as\nJ\nS\u03bc\u2032 = M\u03bc\u03bd\nS\u03bd ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere summation on repeated indices is understood and\nM J = \u039b\u2020 (J \u2297 J \u2217 )\u039b,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the symbol \"\u2297\" denotes the outer matrix product and the unitary matrix \u039b is defined\nas\n\uf8eb\n\n1 0 0\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n1\n\u2212i\n0\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u039b= \u221a \uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec\n2 \uf8ed0 1 i 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n1 0 0 \u22121\n\n(10)\n\nFrom the structure of M J follows that a deterministic medium does not depolarize, that is\nPF (S) = PF (S \u2032 ) where the degree of polarization PF of the field is defined as\np\nS12 + S22 + S32\nPF (S) =\n.\nS0\n\n(11)\n\nLet us conclude by noticing that for deterministic media the two descriptions in terms of J\nor M J are completely equivalent in the sense that the 16 real elements of M J do not contain\nmore information than the 4 complex elements of J.\n\n2.\n\nNon-deterministic Mueller matrix M\n\nA non-deterministic scatterer is, in a wide-sense, an optical systems which cannot be\ndescribed by a Mueller-Jones matrix. In this class fall all the depolarizing optical system as,\n5\n\n\fe.g., multi-mode optical fibers, particles suspensions, etc.. It has been shown [10, 11] that\nit is possible to describe a non-deterministic optical system as an ensemble of deterministic\nsystems, in such a way that each realization E in the ensemble is characterized by a welldefined Jones matrix J(E) occurring with probability pE \u2265 0. Then, the Mueller matrix M\nof the system can be written as\nM = \u039b\u2020 (J \u2297 J \u2217 )\u039b\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the bar symbol denotes the average with respect to the ensemble representing the\nmedium:\nJ \u2297 J\u2217 =\n\nX\nE\n\npE J(E) \u2297 J \u2217 (E).\n\n(13)\n\nAt this point it is useful to introduce the auxiliary 4 \u00d7 4 Hermitian matrix H defined as\n\u2217\nH\u03bc\u03bd = Jij Jkl\n,\n\n(\u03bc = 2i + j, \u03bd = 2k + l),\n\n(14)\n\nwhich is, by definition, positive semidefinite, that is all its eigenvalues {\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 } are nonnegative. Then, it is possible to show that the depolarization index DM and the polarization\nentropy EM can be written as\nDM\n\n\"\n\n1\n=\n3\n\nEM = \u2212\n\n4\n\n3\nX\n\u03bd=0\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03bb2\u03bd \u2212 1\n\n!#1/2\n\n\u03bb\u03bd log4 (\u03bb\u03bd ).\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\n\u03bd=0\n\nFrom ref. [5] we know that EM is a multi-valued function of DM and that this dependence determines some physical bounds to any polarization scattering process. The function EM (DM ) shows thus character of universality. In the next Section we shall confirm this\ntheoretical prediction with experimental results.\n\nB.\n\nUnpolarized light and depolarizing media\n\nIn classical optics, a light beam appears to be depolarized when its polarization direction\nvaries rapidly with respect to other degrees of freedom that are not measured during the\nexperiment (e.g. wavelength, time or position of the beam) [12]. Moreover, depolarization\noccurs also when a single-mode polarization input beam is coupled with a multi-mode (either\n6\n\n\fspectral or spatial) system as, e.g., an optical fiber. In fact it is possible to identify two basic\ndepolarizing processes, (a) one intrinsic to the medium, and (b) one due to the measurement\nscheme. In the first case (a) non-stationary temporal fluctuations of the optical properties\nof the medium, for instance due to the Brownian motion of suspended particles in a liquid\n[13], cause depolarization even when a single-mode detection scheme is employed (the time\naverage performed during the measurement is responsible for the depolarization). On the\nother hand, type (b) stationary depolarizers (i.e. glass fibers) do not fluctuate in time and\nproduce light depolarization only in the presence of a multi-mode detection scheme. In this\ncase it is simple to build explicitly the ensemble of Mueller-Jones matrices representative of\nthe medium, that we introduced in the previous subsection.\nTo this end, let us consider the case of a scattering process in which a coupling between\npolarization and spatial modes of the field occurs and a multi-mode detection scheme is employed. This is, in fact, the case occurring for the optical fibers we used. The Mueller-Stokes\nformalism, is suitable for a single-mode description of the field; however, it is possible to\nextend this formalism to the case in which Nin spatial modes of the field impinge on the\nscatterer, Nout leave from it and D modes are eventually detected. We make the assumption that different spatial modes of the field are uncorrelated, that is we do not consider\ninterference phenomena which are ruled out by the required linearity with respect to the\nintensities of the field [9]. Moreover, without loss of generality, we assume Nin = Nout = N.\nLet S(j) \u2261 {S0 (j), S1 (j), S2 (j), S3 (j)} be a generic 4-D Stokes vector defined with respect to\nthe mode j, where j \u2208 {1, . . . , N}. For a N-mode field we have a collection of N of these 4-D\nStokes vectors that we can arrange in a single 4N-D \"super\" vector S = {S(1), . . . , S(N)}.\nWhen the N-mode light beam undergoes a polarization-sensitive scattering, then, in general,\nthe Stokes vectors {Sin (j)} of the input beam are related to the set of vectors {Sout (j)} of\nthe output beam by:\nSout (j) =\n\nN\nX\n\nM J (j, j0 )Sin (j0 ),\n\n(j = 1, . . . , N),\n\n(17)\n\nj0 =1\n\nwhere M J (j, j0 ) is the 4 \u00d7 4 Mueller-Jones matrix that describes the scattering from the\ninput mode j0 to the output mode j.

(17)\nin a compact form as\nSout = M * Sin .\n\n(19)\n\nAfter the scattering process took place, we have to detect its products. We recently showed\n[14] that when D < N modes of the field are detected, a mode-insensitive polarization\nanalyzer, put in front of a bucket-detector, can be described by a 4N \u00d7 4N block-diagonal\nmatrix A:\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ecA(1)\n\uf8ec\n..\n\uf8ec\n.\n\uf8ec\nA\u2261\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nA(D)\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(20)\n\nwhere A(j), (j = 1, . . . , D) are 4 \u00d7 4 real-valued positive semi-definite matrices (in fact,\nprojectors), and 0 is a null (N \u2212 D) \u00d7 (N \u2212 D) matrix. In the paraxial limit (D << N)\neach A(j) reduces to the 4 \u00d7 4 identity. Then, the polarization state of the scattered beam\nafter the analyzer, is described by the super Stokes vector SD given by\nSD = A * M * Sin .\n\n(21)\n\nFinally, because of the mode-insensitive detection, the sum over all the detected modes\nreduces the number of degrees of freedom of the field from 4N to 4, producing the detected\n4-D Stokes vector SD\nSD =\n\nN\nX\n\nSD (j) = Meff Sin (1),\n\n(22)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere we have assumed that the input light beam is prepared in the single mode j0 = 1, so\nthat Sin (j0 ) = \u03b4j0 1 Sin (1) and with Meff we have denoted an effective 4 \u00d7 4 Mueller matrix\ndefined as\nMeff =\n\nD\nX\n\nA(j)M J (j, 1),\n\n(23)\n\nj=1\n\nwhich is written as a sum of D Mueller-Jones matrices. It is important to notice that while\nthe product of Mueller-Jones matrices is still a Mueller-Jones matrix (in physical terms:\n8\n\n\fSin\n\nHe-Ne\n\nP1\n\nH1\n\nPH\n\nQ1\n\nMO\n\nPO\n\nSout\nL\n\nPD\nQ2\n\nP2\n\nAU\n\nPU\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the polarization tomography set-up.

Moreover, since the \"matrix coefficients\"\nA(j) are non-negative, the matrix Meff in Eq. (23) is an explicit version of the Mueller\nmatrix written in Eq. (12). Then we have shown, by an explicit derivation, how to build\nthe statistical ensemble representing the depolarizing medium, for this particular case.\n\nIII.\n\nA.\n\nDEPOLARIZATION EXPERIMENTS\n\nExperimental scheme for polarization tomography\n\nIn order to measure the effective Mueller matrix Meff and thus the index of depolarization\nDM and the entropy EM of a scattering medium, it is straightforward to follow a tomography\nprocedure: The light to be scattered by the sample is successively prepared in the four\npolarization basis states of linear (V, H, +45\u25e6 ) and circular (RHC) polarization, which are\nrepresented by four independent input Stokes vectors Sin . For each of these input fields the\ncorresponding Stokes vector Sout , that represents the output field, is obtained by measuring\nthe intensities of the scattered light in the same four polarization basis states. This procedure\nprovides the 4 \u00d7 4 independent parameters required to determine the 16 elements M\u03bc\u03bd of\nthe Mueller matrix from Eq.(8). Note that we actually employ two additional polarization\nbasis states (\u221245\u25e6 , LHC) in our experiments and perform 6 \u00d7 6 measurement, which allows\nus to reduce experimental errors by averaging within the over-complete data set.\nThe experimental scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1. The light source is a power-stabilized\n\n9\n\n\fHe-Ne laser at 633 nm wavelength. The input field is prepared by the polarizer unit (PU),\nconsisting of a fixed polarizer (P1), a half-wave plate (H1), and a quarter-wave plate (Q1).\nA microscope objective (MO, \u00d750/0.55) couples the light into the sample. The scattered\nlight is collimated by a standard photographic objective (PO, 50 mm/1.9), followed by an\nadjustable pinhole (PH) that defines the amount of transverse spatial average to be performed in the light detection. The analyzer unit (AU) consists of a quarter-wave plate (Q2)\nand a polarizer (P2). Together with a focusing lens (L) and a photodiode (PD), it probes\nthe polarization state of the scattered output field. As an estimation of the systematic error\nof the set-up, mainly due to imperfections of the used retarders, we measured the Mueller\nmatrix of air (i.e. the identity matrix) and of well-known deterministic optical elements such\nas wave-plates. In all these cases, we found the deviations from the theoretically predicted\nmatrix elements limited to |\u2206M\u03bc\u03bd | \u2264 \u00b10.04.\nB.\n\nCollection of scattering media\n\nThe various scattering media we investigated can be divided into (a) non-stationary\nsamples where, e.g., Brownian motion induces temporal fluctuations within the detection\nintegration time, and (b) stationary samples without such fluctuations, most notably multimode polymer and glass optical fibers. More specifically, we chose our scatterers from:\n(a) Non-stationary media:\n\u2013 polystyrene microspheres (2 \u03bcm dia., suspended in water, Duke Scientific Co.,\nUSA).\n\u2013 diluted milk;\n(b) Stationary media:\n\u2013 ZenithTM polymer sheet diffusers (100 \u03bcm thick, SphereOptics Hoffman GmbH,\nGermany);\n\u2013 holographic light shaping diffusers (0.5\u25e6 , 1\u25e6 , 5\u25e6 , and 10\u25e6 scattering angle, Physical\nOptics Co., USA);\n\u2013 quartz/silica wedge depolarizers and quartz Lyot depolarizers, Halbo Optics, UK);\n\n10\n\n\f\u2013 step-index polymer optical fiber (NA=0.55, core dias. 250 \u03bcm, 500 \u03bcm, 750 \u03bcm\nESKA CK type, Mitsubishi Rayon, Japan);\n\u2013 step-index glass optical fiber (NA=0.48, core dias. 200 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, 600 \u03bcm\nFT-x-URT type, distributed by Thorlabs, Inc., USA);\n\u2013 step-index glass optical fiber (NA=0.22, core dia. 50 \u03bcm, ASF50 type, distributed\nby Thorlabs, Inc., USA);\n\u2013 graded-index glass optical fiber (NA=0.27, core dia. 62, 5 \u03bcm, GIF625 type,\ndistributed by Thorlabs, Inc., USA).\n\nC.\n\nExperimental results\n\nFor a large collection of different samples, Fig. 2 shows the measured polarization entropy\nEM vs. the corresponding index of depolarization DM . The black lines represent the calculated analytical boundaries in the (EM , DM ) plane, whose functional dependence EM (DM )\nwas derived in Ref. [5]. These boundaries provide universal constraints to the possible values\n(EM , DM ) for any physical scattering system, that is, the range of admissible values is restricted to the rather limited grey-shaded area within the boundaries. As it is apparent from\nthe experimental data, our choice of samples allowed us to widely fill in the range of values\n(EM , DM ), in good agreement with the prediction from Ref. [5]. For rather different scattering media, we observed similar values of the pairs (EM , DM ), which display the universality\nin this quantitative description of the depolarizing properties. We found samples throughout\nthe full range of values in entropy and depolarizing power, 0 \u2264 EM , DM \u2264 1. However, note\nthat the region below the curve connecting the points A and C in the (EM , DM ) plane is\nnot covered by any data so far. Work is in progress to investigate this peculiarity.\nSeveral scatterer-specific tuning parameters allowed us to realize this wide range of depolarizing systems and to reveal details of the depolarizing properties for the various media, as\nwill be discussed in the following subsection.\nThe most versatile scatterers used to acquire data in the (EM , DM ) plane, were the multimode optical fibers. For them, the depolarization is caused by multiple reflections within\nthe cylindrical light-guide together with mode mixing. We selected fibers of various lengths\nthat displayed the full range between non-depolarizing and completely depolarizing prop11\n\n\f1\n\nA\n0.8\n\nB\n(a) Non-stationary:\n\n0.6\n\nEM\n\nMicrospheres\nMilk\n\n(b) Stationary:\n\nPolymer diffuser\nHolographic diffuser\n+ wave plate\nWedge depolarizer\nLyot depolarizer\nStep index Polymer fibers\nStep index glass fibers\nGraded index glass fibers\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nC\n\nD\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nDM\n\nFIG. 2:\n\nMeasured entropy (EM ) vs. index of depolarization (DM ) for (a) non-stationary and\n\n(b) stationary scattering media.

Fibers shorter than about 2 cm showed negligible depolarization (DM \u2248 1). In\nthe case of the glass fibers complete depolarization (DM \u2248 0) was observed for lengths of\n\u2248 5 m, whereas in the case of the polymer fibers this was achieved already for lengths of\nonly \u2248 50 cm. The reason is, presumably, the significant Rayleigh scattering at density\nfluctuations in the polymer material [15].\nIn our experimental scheme, the aperture of the pinhole (PH) defines the region of spatial\nof average in the scattered light detection (see Fig. 1). By choosing the pinhole diameter\nbetween 2 mm and 13 mm, we realized scattering systems which are described by different\n\n12\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\nA\n\nA\n\n(a)\n\n0.8\n\n(b)\n\n0.8\n\nB\n\nB\n0.6\n\nEM\n\nEM\n\n0.6\n\nC\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nC\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nD\n\nD\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nDM\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nDM\n\n1\n\nA\n\n(c)\n\n0.8\n\nB\nEM\n\n0.6\n\nC\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nD\n\n0\n0\n\nFIG. 3:\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nDM\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nMeasured entropy (EM ) vs. index of depolarization (DM ) for (a) step-index polymer\n\noptical fibers (\u0007); (b) step-index glass optical fibers (\u2022), graded-index glass optical fibers (\u25e6);\n(c) microspheres (N), milk (H), polymer diffuser (\u0003), holographic diffusers with wave plate (\u0004),\nwedge depolarizers (\u25b3), and Lyot depolarizers (\u25bd). The analytical boundaries are indicated by the\ncontinuous lines.\n\neffective Mueller matrices Meff . In fact, a small pinhole, corresponding to an average over a\nsmall set of modes j in Eq. (23), leads to a large index of depolarization. However, due to\nthe huge optical mode volume in our fibers, the pinhole adjustment allowed only for small\n\n13\n\n\fchanges, within |\u2206DM | \u2264 \u00b10.05. With a lower limit of 2 mm in the pinhole diameter,\nspecial care was taken to select a sufficiently large number of speckles in the scattered output field. (The step-index glass fiber with 50 \u03bcm core showed the largest speckles of about\n500 \u03bcm FWHM.) This is necessary in order to average out interference effects, generated\nby the coherent source (He-Ne laser), so that the assumption of uncorrelated modes in the\nderivation of Meff holds [16].\n\nD.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn Fig. 3, we separately show the results for (a) step-index polymer fibers, (b) step-index\nand graded-index glass fibers, and (c) other scattering media. For the polymer fibers it\nis apparent that most of the data fall on the upper curve connecting the points A and\nD. This curve corresponds to Mueller matrices that have an associated operator H with\nits four eigenvalues of the degenerate form {\u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bc, \u03bc}. This degeneracy can be associated\nwith isotropic depolarizers, which is obviously a good description for the polymer fibers.\nContrarily, in Fig. 3(b) (glass fibers), we fill in also the allowed (EM , DM ) domain below\nthe isotropy curve. These domains correspond to anisotropic media, the anisotropy being\nsupposedly due to stress-induced birefringence in the glass fibers. It was actually this birefringence which we used as an additional tuning parameter accounting for changes of a few\npercent in the index of depolarization. The data obtained for long fiber samples, both in\npolymer and glass, are close to the cuspidal point A (\u03bb = \u03bc = 1/4), which corresponds to\ntotal depolarizers. Contrarily, the data for very short fiber samples are close to the cuspidal\npoint D (\u03bb = 1, \u03bc = 0), which corresponds to a deterministic (i.e. non-depolarizing) system.\nIn case of watery suspensions such as milk and microspheres, we observed purely isotropic\ndepolarization, i.e. all data are found on the isotropic curve, similar to the polymer optical\nfibers (see Fig. 3(c)). We adjusted the depolarizing power by varying the concentration of\nthe scatterers. The 100 \u03bcm thick ZenithTM polymer diffuser sheet was found to be almost\ncompletely depolarizing, whereas the holographic diffusers, when used alone, did not cause\nany significant depolarization. The latter effect is due to the absence of multiple scattering\nin the transmission of light through these surface-optical elements. In combination with a\nsubsequent wave-plate we could, however, couple the scattered light angular spectrum to\nthe polarization degrees of freedom, and thus achieve depolarization.\n14\n\n\fFinally, the data for standard wedge and Lyot depolarizers are also shown in Fig. 3(c).\nWedge depolarizers are designed to completely depolarize a well defined linear input polarization, whereas our tomographic measurement procedure represents an average over all\nindependent input polarizations. This results in a non-zero index of depolarization. The\nLyot depolarizer is, within the experimental error, non-depolarizing since it is designed to\ndepolarize a broadband light source while we operated with a monochromatic laser source.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBy means of polarization tomography we have experimentally characterized the depolarizing properties for a large set of scattering optical media. We describe these media with\nboth the index of depolarization DM and the polarization entropy EM that is added by\nthe medium to the scattered field. These quantities are derived from a measured effective\nMueller matrix, which we formally introduce in the description of scattering systems\nsubject to a multi-mode detection, as is the case of our experimental configuration. The\nset of studied media ranges from non-stationary scatterers such as milk and polystyrene\nmicrospheres to stationary scatterers such as multi-mode optical fibers, diffusers, and\nstandard wedge depolarizers.\nIn Ref. [5] a universality was predicted for the possible values of EM and DM , these values\nbeing restricted to a limited domain described by a set of analytical boundaries. The\ncollected experimental data for our scatterers fill in this domain almost completely and give\nevidence of the predicted depolarization universality in light scattering. A certain range of\nthe predicted (EM , DM ) values is, however, not covered by the scatterers we investigated so\nfar. Work on this issue is currently under progress.\nFurthermore, the quantities DM and EM provide insights into the particular depolarization\nmechanisms of the various media, as well as a consistency check for the measured data (see\n[16]), and may provide a useful classification of optical scatterers for quantum applications,\nwhere depolarization stands for decoherence [7]. In this spirit, an extension to twin photon\nquantum scattering experiments is relatively straight-forward. Work along this line is also\nunder progress in our group.\nWe have greatly benefited from many discussions with Martin van Exter and with Eric\n15\n\n\fEliel, who are acknowledged. This project is part of the program of FOM and is also\nsupported by the EU under the IST-ATESIT contract.\n\n[1] J. F. de Boer, T. E. Milner, M. J. C. van Gemert, and J. S. Nelson, Opt.
