The matter 16-plet contains the 15 chiral superfields of MSSM as well\nas the right handed neutrino superfield. The implications of this Yukawa unification\ncondition at MGUT \u223c 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV have been extensively explored over the years\n[1, 2]. In SO(10) Yukawa unification with \u03bc > 0 and universal gaugino masses, the\ngluino is the lightest colored sparticle [3, 4], which is now being tested [5] at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). The squarks and sleptons, especially those from the first two\nfamilies, turn out to have masses in the multi-TeV range. Moreover, it is argued in\n[3, 4], based on the results of publicly available codes like Isajet [16] and Softsusy\n[6], that the lightest neutralino is not a viable cold dark matter candidate in SO(10)\nYukawa unification with \u03bc > 0 and universal gaugino masses at MGUT . On the other\nhand, in Ref.[3] it is shown that neutralino DM is allowed through h-resonance for\nYukawa unification at the 10%level.\nSpurred by these developments we have investigated t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification [4,\n7, 8] in the framework of SUSY SU (4)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R [9] (4-2-2, for short). The\n4-2-2 structure allows us to consider non-universal gaugino masses while preserving\nYukawa unification. An important conclusion reached in [4, 7] is that with same\nsign non-universal gaugino soft terms, Yukawa unification in 4-2-2 is compatible with\nneutralino dark matter and gluino co-annihilation [4, 5, 7, 10] being a unique dark\nmatter scenario for \u03bc > 0.\nBy considering opposite sign gauginos with \u03bc < 0, M2 < 0, M3 > 0 where \u03bc is the\ncoefficient of the bilinear Higgs mixing term, M2 and M3 are the soft supersymmetry\nbreaking (SSB) gaugino mass terms corresponding to SU (2)L and SU (3)c respectively,\nit is shown in [8] that Yukawa coupling unification consistent with the experimental\nconstraints can be implemented in 4-2-2. With \u03bc < 0 and opposite sign gauginos,\nYukawa coupling unification is achieved for m16 & 300 GeV, as opposed to m16 &\n8 TeV for the case of same sign gauginos. The finite corrections to the b-quark mass\nplay an important role here [8]. By considering gauginos with M2 < 0, M3 > 0 and\n\u03bc < 0, we can obtain the correct sign for the desired contribution to (g \u2212 2)\u03bc [11].\nThis enables us to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification\nin 4-2-2, neutralino dark matter and (g \u2212 2)\u03bc , as well as a variety of other bounds.\nEncouraged by the abundance of solutions and co-annihilation channels available\nin the case of Yukawa unified 4-2-2 with M2 < 0 and \u03bc < 0, it seems natural to\nexplore Yukawa unification in SO(10) GUT (with M2 < 0 and \u03bc < 0). It has been\npointed out [12] that non-universal MSSM gaugino masses at MGUT can arise from\nnon-singlet F-terms, compatible with the underlying GUT symmetry such as SU(5)\n2\n\n\fand SO(10). The SSB gaugino masses in supergravity [13] can arise, say, from the\nfollowing dimension five operator:\n\u2212\n\nF ab a b\n\u03bb \u03bb + c.c.\n2MP\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u03bba is the two-component gaugino field, F ab denotes the F-component of the\nfield which breaks SUSY, the indices a, b run over the adjoint representation of the\ngauge group, and MP = 2.4 \u00d7 1018 GeV is the reduced Planck mass. The resulting\ngaugino mass matrix is hF ab i/MP where the supersymmetry breaking parameter hF ab i\ntransforms as a singlet under the MSSM gauge group SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y . The\nF ab fields belong to an irreducible representation in the symmetric part of the direct\nproduct of the adjoint representation of the unified group. This is a supersymmetric\ngeneralization of operators considered a long time ago [14].\nIn SO(10), for example,\n(45 \u00d7 45)S = 1 + 54 + 210 + 770\n\n(2)\n\nIf F transforms as a 54 or 210 dimensional representation of SO(10) [12], one obtains\nthe following relation among the MSSM gaugino masses at MGUT :\nM3 : M2 : M1 = 2 : \u22123 : \u22121,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere M1 , M2 , M3 denote the gaugino masses of U (1), SU (2)L and SU (3)c respectively. The low energy implications of this relation have recently been investigated\nin [15] without imposing Yukawa unification. We consider the case with \u03bc > 0 and\nnon-universal gaugino masses defined in Eq.(3) in this paper. In order to obtain the\ncorrect sign for the desired contribution to (g \u22122)\u03bc , we set signs of the gaugino masses\nas M1 > 0, M2 > 0 and M3 < 0. Somewhat to our surprise, we find that this class of\nt-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification models make a rather sharp prediction for the mass of the\nlightest SM-like Higgs boson. In addition, lower mass bounds on the masses of the\nsquarks and gluino are obtained.\nNotice that in general, the soft terms such as the trilinear couplings and scalar\n(mass)2 terms are not necessarily universal at MGU T . However, we can assume,\nconsistent with SO(10) gauge symmetry, that the coefficients associated with terms\nthat violate the SO(10)-invariant form are suitably small, except for the gaugino\nterm in Eq.(1). We also assume that D-term contributions to the SSB term are much\nsmaller compared with contributions from fields with non-zero auxiliary F-terms.\nThe outline for the rest of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we summarize\nthe scanning procedure and the experimental constraints that we have employed.\nIn Section 3 we discuss the important role of SUSY threshold corrections in t-b-\u03c4\nYukawa unification. In Section 4 we discuss how radiative electroweak symmetry\n3\n\n\fbreaking (REWSB) is compatible in our model despite setting mHu = mHd at MGUT .\nIn Section 5 we present our results, focusing in particular on the mass of the lightest\n(SM-like) CP even Higgs boson, as well as the masses of squarks and gluino. The\ntable in this section lists some benchmark points which will be tested at the LHC.\nOur conclusions are summarized in Section 6.\n\n2\n\nPhenomenological Constraints and Scanning Procedure\n\nWe employ the ISAJET 7.80 package [16] to perform random scans over the fundamental parameter space. In this package, the weak scale values of gauge and third\ngeneration Yukawa couplings are evolved to MGUT via the MSSM renormalization\ngroup equations (RGEs) in the DR regularization scheme. We do not strictly enforce\nthe unification condition g3 = g1 = g2 at MGUT , since a few percent deviation from\nunification can be assigned to unknown GUT-scale threshold corrections [17]. The\ndeviation between g1 = g2 and g3 at MGUT is no worse than 3 \u2212 4%. For simplicity we\ndo not include the Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling in the RGEs, whose contribution\nis expected to be small.\nThe various boundary conditions are imposed at MGUT and all the SSB parameters, along with the gauge and Yukawa couplings, are evolved back to the weak scale\nMZ . In the evaluation of Yukawa couplings the SUSY threshold corrections [18] are\n\u221a\ntaken into account at the common scale MSUSY = mt\u0303L mt\u0303R where mt\u0303L and mt\u0303R are\nthe third generation left and right handed stop quarks. The entire parameter set\nis iteratively run between MZ and MGUT using the full 2-loop RGEs until a stable\nsolution is obtained. To better account for leading-log corrections, one-loop step-beta\nfunctions are adopted for gauge and Yukawa couplings, and the SSB parameters mi\nare extracted from RGEs at multiple scales mi = mi (mi ). The RGE-improved 1-loop\neffective potential is minimized at MSUSY , which effectively accounts for the leading\n2-loop corrections. Full 1-loop radiative corrections are incorporated for all sparticle\nmasses.\nThe approximate error of \u00b13 GeV in the ISAJET estimate of the Higgs mass\nlargely arise from theoretical uncertainties in the calculation of the minimum of the\nscalar potential, and to a lesser extend from experimental uncertainties in the values\nfor mt and \u03b1s .\nAn important constraint comes from limits on the cosmological abundance of stable charged particles [19]. This excludes regions in the parameter space where charged\nSUSY particles become the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). We accept only\nthose solutions for which one of the neutralinos is the LSP and saturates the WMAP\nbound on relic dark matter abundance.\n\n4\n\n\fThe MSSM Higgs doublets reside in the 10 dimensional representation of SO(10)\nand fermions of the third family belong to the 16 dimensional representation of\nSO(10), which implies Yukawa coupling unification at MGUT .\nWe have performed random scans for the following parameter range:\n0 \u2264 m16 \u2264 5 TeV\n0 \u2264 m10 \u2264 5 TeV\n0 \u2264 M1/2 \u2264 2 TeV\n35 \u2264 tan \u03b2 \u2264 55\n\u22123 \u2264 A0 /m16 \u2264 3\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nHere m16 is the universal SSB mass for MSSM sfermions, m10 is the universal SSB\nmass term for up and down MSSM Higgs masses, M1/2 is the gaugino mass parameter,\ntan \u03b2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the two MSSM Higgs\ndoublets, A0 is the universal SSB trilinear scalar interaction (with corresponding\nYukawa coupling factored out). We use mt = 173.1 GeV [20]. Note that our results\nare not too sensitive to one or two sigma variation in the value of mt [21]. We use\nmb (mZ ) = 2.83 GeV which is hard-coded into ISAJET.\nIn scanning the parameter space, we employ the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\nas described in [22]. The data points collected all satisfy the requirement of REWSB,\nwith the neutralino in each case being the LSP. After collecting the data, we impose\nthe mass bounds on all the particles [19] and use the IsaTools package [23] to implement the various phenomenological constraints. We successively apply the following\nexperimental constraints on the data that we acquire from ISAJET:\nmh (lightest Higgs mass)\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\n\u22124\n2.85 \u00d7 10 \u2264 BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3)\nu \u2192\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 )MSSM\n0.15 \u2264 BR(B\nBR(Bu \u2192\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 )SM\n\u03a9CDM h2\n0 \u2264 \u2206(g \u2212 2)\u03bc /2\n\n\u2265 114.4 GeV\n[24]\n\u22128\n< 1.2 \u00d7 10\n[25]\n\u2264 4.24 \u00d7 10\u22124 (2\u03c3)\n[26]\n\u2264 2.41 (3\u03c3)\n[26]\n= 0.1123 \u00b1 0.0035 (5\u03c3) [27]\n\u2264 55.6 \u00d7 10\u221210\n[11]\n\nEmploying the boundary condition from Eq.(3) one can define the MSSM gaugino\nmasses at MGUT in terms of the mass parameter M1/2 :\nM1 = M1/2\nM2 = 3M1/2\nM3 = \u22122M1/2\n\n(6)\n\nNote that M2 and M3 have opposite signs which, as we show, is important implementing Yukawa coupling unification to a high accuracy.\n5\n\n\f3\n\nThreshold corrections and Yukawa unification\n\nThe SUSY threshold corrections to the top, bottom and tau Yukawa couplings play\na crucial role in t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa coupling unification. In general, the bottom Yukawa\ncoupling yb can receive large threshold corrections, while the threshold corrections to\nyt are typically smaller [18]. The scale at which Yukawa coupling unification occurs\nis identified with MGUT , the scale of gauge coupling unification. Consider first the\ncase yt (MGUT ) \u2248 y\u03c4 (MGUT ). The SUSY correction to the tau lepton mass is given by\n\u03b4m\u03c4 = v cos \u03b2\u03b4y\u03c4 . For the large tan \u03b2 values of interest here, there is sufficient freedom\nin the choice of \u03b4y\u03c4 to achieve yt \u2248 y\u03c4 at MGUT . This freedom stems from the fact\nthat cos \u03b2 ' 1/ tan \u03b2 for large tan \u03b2, and so we may choose an appropriate \u03b4y\u03c4 and\ntan \u03b2 to give us both the correct \u03c4 lepton mass and yt \u2248 y\u03c4 . The SUSY contribution\nto \u03b4yb has to be carefully monitored in order to achieve Yukawa coupling unification\nyt (MGUT ) \u2248 yb (MGUT ) \u2248 y\u03c4 (MGUT ).\nWe choose the sign of \u03b4yi (i = t, b, \u03c4 ) from the perspective of evolving yi from\nMGUT to MZ . With this choice, \u03b4yb must receive a negative contribution (\u22120.27 .\n\u03b4yb /yb . \u22120.15) in order to realize Yukawa coupling unification. This is a narrow\ninterval considering the full range of \u22120.4 . \u03b4yb /yb . 0.4. The dominant contribution\nto \u03b4yb arises from the finite gluino and chargino loop corrections, and in our sign\nconvention, it is approximately given by [18]\n\u03b4ybfinite \u2248\n\nyt2 \u03bcAt tan \u03b2\ng32 \u03bcmg\u0303 tan \u03b2\n+\n,\n12\u03c0 2\nm2b\u0303\n32\u03c0 2\nm2t\u0303\n\n(7)\n\nwhere g3 is the strong gauge coupling, mg\u0303 is the gluino mass, mb\u0303 and mt\u0303 are the\nsbottom and stop masses, and At is the top trilinear (scalar) coupling.\nThe logarithmic corrections to yb are positive, which leaves the finite corrections\nto provide for the correct overall negative \u03b4yb in order to realize Yukawa unification.\nThe gluino contribution (in Eq.(7)) is positive for \u03bc > 0 for the case of same sign\ngaugino SBB mass term. Thus, the chargino contribution (in Eq.(7)) must play\nan essential role to provide the required negative contribution to \u03b4yb . This can be\nachieved with suitably large values of both m16 and At , which is the reason behind\nthe requirement m16 & 6 TeV and A0 /m16 \u223c \u22122.6 in the SO(10) model discussed in\n[3, 4].\nOne can improve the situation immensely by considering the case of opposite\nsign gaugino soft terms which is allowed by the 4-2-2 model. Reference [8] shows\nthe parameter space, corresponding to \u03bc < 0, M2 < 0, M3 > 0, that gives Yukawa\ncoupling unification with a sub-TeV sparticle spectrum, and which is consistent with\nall known experimental bounds including \u2206(g\u22122)\u03bc . Another possibility is to consider\n\u03bc > 0, M2 > 0, M3 < 0. This choice also improves the situation about t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa\nunification, since it provides a negative gluino loop contribution to \u03b4yb .\n6\n\n\f4\n\nt-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification with mHu = mHd\n\nAfter scanning the parameter space listed in Eq.(5), and employing the GUT scale\nboundary condition for the gauginos in Eq.(6), we find that REWSB can occur,\ncompatible with t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification, even if we set mHu = mHd . Note that this\nis very difficult to achieve if gaugino mass universality is imposed at MGUT [28]. In\norder to explain our findings, consider the following one loop renormalization group\nequations for m2Hu , m2Hd and the soft trilinear terms At,b,\u03c4 [29]:\n6\n3\nd 2\nmHu = 3Xt \u2212 6g22 |M2 |2 \u2212 g12 |M1 |2 + g12 ,\ndt\n5\n5\n6 2\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2 d\n16\u03c0 mHd = 3Xb + X\u03c4 \u2212 6g2 |M2 | \u2212 g1 |M1 |2 \u2212 g12 S.\ndt\n5\n5\n\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nh\nd\n16\n13 i\nAt = At 18yt2 + yb2 \u2212 g32 \u2212 3g22 \u2212 g12 + 2Ab yb yt\ndt\n3\n15\nh 32\ni\n26\n2\n2\n2\n(10)\n+yt\ng M3 + 6g2 M2 + g1 M1 ,\n3 3\n15\nh\nd\n7 i\n16\n16\u03c0 2 Ab = Ab 18yb2 + yt2 + y\u03c42 \u2212 g32 \u2212 3g22 \u2212 g12 + 2At yt yb + 2A\u03c4 y\u03c4 yb\ndt\n3\n15\nh 32\ni\n14\n+yb\ng 2 M3 + 6g22 M2 + g12 M1 ,\n(11)\n3 3\n15\nh\nh\ni\n9 i\n18\nd\n16\u03c0 2 A\u03c4 = A\u03c4 12y\u03c42 + 3yb2 \u2212 3g22 \u2212 g12 + 6Ab yb y\u03c4 + y\u03c4 6g22 M2 + g12 M1 .

(8) and (9), terms with negative coefficients drive m2Hu and m2Hd to larger\nvalues in the evolution from MGUT to MZ , while the terms with positive signs clearly\nhave the opposite effect. On the other hand, at scale MZ ,the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking minimization condition at tree level requires that\n\u03bc2 =\n\nm2Hd \u2212 m2Hu tan2 \u03b2 MZ2\n\u2212\ntan2 \u03b2 \u2212 1\n2\n7\n\n(17)\n\n\fFor moderate to large values for tan \u03b2 and assuming that |m2Hu | \u001d MZ2 , we can\nget \u03bc2 \u2248 \u2212m2Hu . In order to have REWSB, m2Hu must be driven to negative values.\nIn the literature, two alternative ways are used to achieve m2Hu < 0. In one case\nwith yt > yb , y\u03c4 , m2Hu is driven to negative values at MZ by yt , as seen from Eqs.(8)\nand (13). In this case it is possible to find solutions for which mHu = mHd at\nMGUT . In a model with universal gaugino masses at MGUT , we need a very large\nm16 > 6 TeV and and even larger trilinear SSB coupling, A0 \u223c \u22122.6m16 , in order\nthat yt (MGUT ) = yb (MGUT ) = y\u03c4 (MGUT ). As we know, one has yt > yb > y\u03c4 all\nthe way from MGUT to MZ , and the SSB terms in Eqs.(13) and (14) renormalize\nmore or less equally. This means that Xt > Xb , but the additional contribution\nfrom X\u03c4 makes the contributions from the positive terms in Eq.(9) larger than the\ncorresponding positive contributions in Eq. (8). As a result, m2Hd is driven to negative\nvalues earlier than m2Hu at MZ , which is phenomenologically not acceptable. To avoid\nthis problem, one can impose mHu < mHd at MGUT . As we mentioned in Section\n3, with opposite signs for M2 and M3 at MGUT , t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification becomes\neasier by appropriately choosing the sign for \u03bc in Eq. (7) [4, 8], and one can have\nt-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification even for m16 \u223c 1 \u2212 2 TeV. Notice that the relative sign of\nM2 and M3 affects the RG running of the trilinear SSB couplings in Eqs.(10)-(12).\nIn most cases, we find At \u223c Ab , while Ab and A\u03c4 have opposite sign at MZ . We see\nfrom Figure 1a that A\u03c4 is driven towards zero and then continues its evolution. This\ntendency helps in changing the direction of evolution for m2Hu .\nAs we will show in the next section, for precise t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa coupling unification,\nmHu = mHd = m10 < 1 TeV at MGUT . Hence, we can conclude that the SSB terms\nin Eqs.(13) and (14) are comparable. Since the values of the SSB terms for opposite\nsigns of gaugino masses are around 1 TeV, the contribution from X\u03c4 in Eq. (9) is not\nvery significant. The coupling yt is slightly larger than yb during RG running, but in\nour case it is enough to drive m2Hu negative at the weak scale.\nThe interplay among these various contributions is neatly summarized in Figure\n1. In the left panel we plot the RG evolution of the three soft trilinear couplings,\nwhile the right panel shows the corresponding evolution of m2Hu and m2Hd . In order\nto have phenomenologically acceptable EWSB we need to have m2Hu more negative\nthan m2Hd at EWSB scale. The relation at high scale between m2Hu and m2Hd is not\nvery important. Figure 1b shows that at the EWSB scale m2Hu is more negative than\nm2Hd . In the text we use MZ as the scale of EWSB.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 1: Evaluation of trilinear SSB couplings (left panel) and the MSSM Higgs\n(right panel) SSB mass terms corresponding to the benchmark point 1 in Table 1.\n\n5\n\nHiggs Boson Mass and Sparticle Spectroscopy\n\nIn order to quantify Yukawa coupling unification, we define the quantity R as,\nR=\n\nmax(yt , yb , y\u03c4 )\nmin(yt , yb , y\u03c4 )\n\n(18)\n\nIn Figure 2 we show the results in the R \u2212 m16 , R \u2212 M1/2 , R \u2212 tan \u03b2, R \u2212 A0 /m16 ,\nR \u2212 m10 and M1/2 \u2212 m16 planes. The panels correspond to the following choice of\nparameters: \u03bc > 0, M2 > 0 and M3 : M2 : M1 = \u22122 : 3 : 1. The gray points are\nconsistent with REWSB and neutralino LSP. The green points satisfy the particle\nmass bounds and constraints from BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) and BR(Bu \u2192\n\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 ). In addition, the green points do no worse than the SM in terms of (g \u2212 2)\u03bc . The\nbrown points belong to a subset of the green points and satisfy the WMAP bounds\non neutralino dark matter abundance.\nIn the R - m16 plane of Figure 2 we see that we can realize perfect Yukawa\nunification consistent with all constraints mentioned in Section 2. This is possible\nbecause we can implement Yukawa unification for relatively small values of m16 (\u223c\n1 TeV). This is more than an order of magnitude reduction in the m16 values required\nfor Yukawa unification, compared with the case \u03bc > 0 and universal gaugino masses.\nIn the R \u2212 M1/2 plane of Figure 2, we see that employing the boundary conditions\nfor gauginos presented in Eq. (6), perfect t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification prefers heavier\n(> 1.2 TeV) values for M1/2 . We can also predict that tan \u03b2 \u2248 47. In this case for\nYukawa unification up to 5% level, 45 \u2264 tan \u03b2 \u2264 48.\nIn the R \u2212 A0 /m16 plane of Figure 2 we see that in the present SO(10) case\nwith 10% or better t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification, we obtain a relaxation of A0 values\n9\n\n\fFigure 2: Plots in R \u2212 m16 , R \u2212 M1/2 , R \u2212 tan \u03b2, R \u2212 A0 /m16 , R \u2212 m10 and M1/2 \u2212 m16\nplanes.

In addition, yellow points represent Yukawa unification within to\n10%. Brown points in mq\u0303 \u2212 mg\u0303 plane that are compatible with WMAP bound on\nrelic abundance are a subset of yellow points in mq\u0303 \u2212 mg\u0303 plane.\nsimilar to the SU (4)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R model in [8], with \u22122.5 < A0 /m16 < 1 for\n\u03bc < 0, and \u22121.5 < A0 /m16 < 3 for \u03bc > 0. The R \u2212 m10 plane shows that precise\nunification prefers 0.2 TeV < m10 < 1 TeV. We see also that relaxing the Yukawa\nunification condition relaxes the upper bound for m10 . In order to better visualize\nthe magnitude of the sparticle masses consistent with t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification, we\npresent our results in the M1/2 \u2212 m16 plane, where the yellow points correspond to\nYukawa unification better than 10%.\n\n11\n\n\fIn Figure 3 we show the results in the R \u2212 mh plane. It is most interesting to\nnote that demanding precise t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification for \u03bc > 0, M2 > 0 and M3 < 0\nallows us to predict the light CP even Higgs mass in a very narrow interval, 122 GeV\n< mh < 124 GeV. For Yukawa unification of up to 5%, it becomes 120 GeV < mh <\n125 GeV. We expect a theoretical uncertainty of about 3 GeV in the calculation of\nthe light Higgs mass.\nIn Figure 4 the mq\u0303 \u2212 mg\u0303 panel shows that t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification in our scenario\npredicts masses for the gluino and the first two family squarks which lie somewhat\nbeyond the current ATLAS [30] and CMS [31] bounds.\nIn the present framework, the WMAP constraint on the relic dark matter abundance is only satisfied by the neutralino-stau co-annihilation scenario. We know that\nin neutralino-stau coannihilation, the neutralino and stau masses are degenerate to\na good approximation. Instead of introducing a new color in the figure, we decided\njust to draw the unit line, and then it is easy to understand that points close to this\nline will give good relic abundance through neutralino-stau coannihilation. From the\nplot in m\u03c4\u0303 \u2212 m\u03c7\u03030 plane of Figure 4, we see that the LSP neutralino mass is greater\nthan or of order 300 GeV. Other co-annihilation scenarios may emerge after doing a\nmore thorough analysis, but this remains to be seen.\nFinally, in Table 1 we present some benchmark points with \u03bc > 0, M2 > 0 and\nM3 < 0. All of these benchmark points satisfy the various constraints, except possibly\nfor a small discrepancy with the WMAP bound on relic dark density. Points 1 and\n2 depict solutions corresponding to minimum R and best \u03a9CDM h2 values. Point 2\ndescribes a solution with m16 = m10 . Point 3 displays a solution with a Higgs boson\nmass close to 124 GeV. The theoretical uncertainty in this estimate is 2-3 GeV.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have reconsidered t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification within a slightly revised framework\nin this paper. The main difference from most previous investigations stems from the\nassumptions we make related to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters. First,\nwe assume that the MSSM gauginos have non-universal masses, which are related to\none another at MGUT by some appropriate SO(10) group theory factors. Second, we\nset the masses of the two MSSM Higgs doublets to be equal at MGUT . Overall, this\nmeans that we effectively have one parameter less than in the standard approach to\nSO(10) Yukawa unification.\nThe ramifications of these slightly different assumptions for TeV scale physics\nturn out to be quite startling, with the low energy predictions being very different\nfrom previous studies. We find, for instance, that t-b-\u03c4 Yukawa unification solutions\nat 5% level or better exist in our model with \u03bc > 0 and M2 > 0.\nThese solutions, obtained using the ISAJET software, are compatible with all\n12\n\n\fm16\nM1\nM2\nM3\nm10\ntan \u03b2\nA0 /m16\nmt\n\u03bc\nB\u03bc\nmh\nmH\nmA\nmH \u00b1\nm\u03c7\u030301,2\nm\u03c7\u030303,4\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b11,2\nmg\u0303\nm\u0169L,R\nmt\u03031,2\nmd \u0303L,R\nmb\u03031,2\nm\u03bd\u03031\nm\u03bd\u03033\nm\u1ebdL,R\nm\u03c4\u03031,2\n\u2206(g \u2212 2)\u03bc\n\u03c3SI (pb)\n\u03c3SD (pb)\n\u03a9CDM h2\nR\n\nPoint 1\n1277\n1302\n3906\n-2604\n613.7\n47.2\n1.41\n173.1\n2216\n20.3\n122.3\n408.7\n406\n420.5\n609.3, 2227.3\n2230.4, 3314.7\n2260.4, 3281.1\n5413.9\n5251.4, 4766.1\n3839.2, 4665.7\n5352, 4759.7\n3969.3, 4640.1\n2784.8\n2639.9\n2789.5, 1355.5\n609.4, 2650.7\n0.68 \u00d7 10\u221210\n0.37 \u00d7 10\u22129\n0.47 \u00d7 10\u22128\n0.176\n1.01\n\nPoint 2\nPoint 3\n1296\n1920\n1174\n1768\n3522\n5304\n-2248\n-3536\n1296\n240.2\n47.3\n46.9\n1.61\n2.73\n173.1\n173.1\n1919.7\n3478.7\n19.5\n26.9\n122.1\n124\n392.5\n559.5\n390\n555.8\n404.7\n568.3\n546.7, 1930.4 833.4, 3487.6\n1933.7, 2986.2 3490.7, 4503.2\n1959.8, 2956 3533.3, 4458.5\n4919.5\n7217.9\n4895.8, 4375.4 7176.2, 6386\n3453.1, 4211.6 4967.6, 6120.1\n4896.5, 4369.9 7176.7, 6378.7\n3589.8, 4188 5168.1, 6088.1\n2585\n3844.3\n2421.7\n3605.8\n2589.3, 1359.5 3849.1, 2016.8\n548.9, 2431.6 842.4, 3621.2\n0.84 \u00d7 10\u221210\n0.35 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\u22129\n0.59 \u00d7 10\n0.46 \u00d7 10\u221210\n0.89 \u00d7 10\u22128\n0.63 \u00d7 10\u22129\n0.189\n0.55\n1.02\n1.01\n\nTable 1: Sparticle and Higgs masses (in GeV) for \u03bc > 0.
