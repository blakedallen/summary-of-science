Experiments reveal\na power law mass distribution of fragments with an exponent close to 1.2, which is significantly\ndifferent from the known exponents of three-dimensional bulk materials. A 3D discrete element\nmodel is introduced which reproduces both the large permanent deformation of the polymer during\nimpact, and the novel value of the mass distribution exponent. We demonstrate that the dominance\nof shear in the crack formation and the plastic response of the material are the key features which\ngive rise to the emergence of the novel universality class of fragmentation phenomena.\nPACS numbers: 62.20.Mk; 46.50.+a; 64.60.-i\n\nFragmentation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature\nand play a crucial role in numerous industrial processes\nrelated to mining and ore processing [1]. A large variety of measurements starting from the breakup of heavy\nnuclei through the usage of explosives in mining or fragmenting asteroids revealed the existence of a striking\nuniversality in fragmentation phenomena [1\u201310]: fragment mass distributions exhibit a power law decay, independent on the type of energy input (impact, explosion, ...), the relevant length scales or the dominating\nmicroscopic interactions involved. Detailed laboratory\nexperiments on the breakup of disordered solids have revealed that mainly the effective dimensionality of the system determines the value of the exponent, according to\nwhich universality classes of fragmentation phenomena\ncan be distinguished. Several possible mechanisms have\nbeen put forward to understand the emergence of the\nuniversal power law behavior. For rapid break-up of heterogeneous bulk solids with a high degree of brittleness,\nthe self-similar branching-merging scenario of propagating unstable cracks governed by tensile stresses can explain the main features of the fragment mass distribution\n[5, 11\u201313], while for shell systems an additional sequential\nbinary breakup mechanism has to be taken into account\n[7, 8]. It is an important question of broad scientific and\ntechnological interest how plasticity, and the emergence\nof complicated stress states like shear affect the fragmentation process. The fundamental questions of how robust\nthe universality classes are with respect to mechanical\nproperties and whether there exist further universality\nclasses of fragmentation of solids, still remain open.\nIn the present Letter we investigate the fragmentation\nprocess of plastic materials by impacting spherical particles made of polypropylene (PP) against a hard wall. Our\nexperiments show that the mass distribution of plastic\nfragments exhibits a power law behavior with an exponent close to 1.2, which is substantially different from the\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Final states of impact at low impact\nvelocities in the experiment (a) and in the simulation (b). In\nthe contact area with the hard wall large permanent deformations occur due to compression, while above it vertical cracks\nare formed due to tensile stresses. The simulations are in very\ngood agreement with the measurements.\n\none of bulk brittle materials in three-dimensions. In order to understand the physical origin of the low exponent,\na three-dimensional discrete element model is developed\nwhere the sample is discretized in terms of spherical particles connected by elastic beams. To capture the fracture mechanisms of plastic materials in the model, broken\nparticle contacts are able to reconnect when compressed\nagainst each other leading eventually to the healing of\ncracks and to a plastic energy dissipation. By adding\ntwo novel ingredients into a DEM model, namely healing\nof broken bonds and breaking under compression, we are\nable to simulate the plastic behavior of PP and reproduce\nin fact the observed new power law distribution.\nIn the experiments we used isotactic polypropylene,\nwhich is a thermoplastic polymer with an intermediate\nlevel of crystallinity in its molecular structure. The most\nimportant parameters of PP are: Young modulus 1300\nM P a (room temperature), glass transition temperature\n\u221210 o C, melting point 160 o C, and density 0.9 g/cm3 .\nBesides tacticity, the mechanical response and fracture\ncharacteristics of PP are also strongly affected both by\n\n\f2\n\nF (m) \u223c m\u2212\u03c4pl\n\n(1)\n\nover more than 3 orders of magnitude in the regime of\nsmall fragments. At lower impact velocities the power\nlaw regime of the distribution is followed by a hump for\nthe largest fragments which gradually disappears and the\ncutoff becomes exponential as v0 increases. The most\nastonishing feature of the experimental results is that\nthe value of the exponent \u03c4pl = 1.2 \u00b1 0.06 of the power\nlaw regime is significantly lower than the values \u03c4br \u2248\n\n45 m/s\n60 m/s\n75 m/s\nSimulations\n\n-3\n\n10\n10\n\n-4\n-5\n\n10\n\n2.2\n\n10\n10\n10\n\nm/m0\n\n-6\n\nI1/I2\n\n10\n\n-7 1.9\n\n-8\n\n-9\n\n1.6\n\nr\n\nF (m)\n\nthe temperature and by the rate of loading: increasing\nstrain rate gives rise to a more brittle response while the\nraising temperature enhances ductility [14]. To achieve\nfragmentation a single particle comminution device was\nused which accelerates particles one-by-one by centrifugal force in a rotor up to the desired velocity. The rotor\nensures that the particles hit the hard wall at a rectangular angle in an evacuated environment eliminating the\ndisturbing effect of inclined impact and of turbulent air\nflow. Spherical PP particles of diameter d = 4 mm were\nfragmented at different impact velocities v0 in the range\n30 m/s-180 m/s. Figure 1(a) shows that at low enough\nvelocities, the collision does not result in a breakup, instead the particles undergo a large plastic deformation at\nthe impact site. Above the completely flattened contact\nzone of permanent deformation meridional cracks form\ndue to tensile stresses, however, the body does not fall\napart, the plastic zone retains its integrity.\nFragmentation occurs when the impact velocity v0 exceeds a material dependent critical value vc , which is\nabout 60m/s for our PP particles. At each impact velocity 400 particles were fragmented accumulating the\nfragments in the grinding chamber of the machine. In\nthe data analysis, 99 \u2212 99.5% of the total mass of the\nsamples was recovered. In order to evaluate the mass distribution of the fragments, we scanned the pieces with an\nopen scanner obtaining digital images where fragments\nappear as white spots on the black background [7, 8].\nThis way the identification of fragments is reduced to\ncluster searching of white pixels. The very fine powder\nof extension smaller then the pixel size of the scanner\nwas left out of the data analysis. The two-dimensional\nprojected area w of fragments is determined as the number of pixels of the clusters, from which the mass m of\nfragments can be estimated as m \u223c w3/2 since the threedimensional fragment shape is close to isotropic. We did\ncheck the shape isotropy by calculating the square root\nof the ratio of the larger I1 and smaller I2 eigenvalues\nof the tensor of inertia of the 2D projections.\nThe inset\np\nof Fig. 2 shows that the value of I1 /I2 is close to 1.9\nfor almost all fragment masses indicating a high level of\nisotropy. The mass distribution F (m) of fragments obtained at three different impact velocities is presented in\nFig. 2. It can be observed in the figure that at the highest\nimpact velocity v0 = 75 m/s, where the state of complete\nbreakup is reached, a power law functional form emerges\n\n1.3\n1.0\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\nm/m0\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Mass distribution of fragments obtained from experiments at three different impact velocities.\nm0 denotes the average mass of PP spheres.

The anomalously low value of \u03c4pl\nis the consequence of the breakup mechanism of plastic\nmaterials which has not been considered by the usual\ntheoretical approaches [6, 12].\nIn order to reveal the underlying physical mechanisms\nof the fragmentation of plastic materials, we used a Discrete Element Model (DEM) to simulate the fragmentation of polymeric particles of spherical shape when they\nimpact a hard wall. The spherical sample is represented\nas a random packing of spheres with a narrow size distribution. The particles are connected by beams along\nthe edges of a Delaunay triangulation of the initial particle positions such that in the initial state neighboring\nelements are in contact. In 3D the total deformation of\na beam is calculated by the superposition of elongation,\ntorsion, as well as bending and shearing in two different\nplanes [15]. To capture one crucial aspect of the deformation behavior and the fracture of plastic materials, our\nDEM model has two novel components, i.e. the form of\nthe breaking criterion of the beam elements and the reactivation of broken contacts under pressure. The beams\nbreak when they get overstressed according to a physical\nbreaking rule [16]\n\u03b5|\u03b5| max (|\u0398i |, |\u0398j |)\n\u2265 1,\n+\n\u03b52th\n\u0398th\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b5 denotes the longitudinal strain, \u0398i and \u0398j are the\ngeneralized bending angles at the two beam ends, and \u03b5th\n\n\f3\n1.0\n\ntension\nbending\nbending&healing\n\nbending & healing\n\nhM\nmax\u001di\n\u001c\n2nd\nMmax\n\n0.6\n\ntension\nhM\nmax\u001di\n\u001c\n2nd\nMmax\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n10\n\nF (m)\n\n0.8\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\nv0/vc\n\n3\n\nsh\nbr\n\n-4\n\n10\n\na)\n\n0.0\n0\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-5\n\nsh-pl\n\nb)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\nm\n\n10\n\n10\n\n4\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) (a) The average mass of the largest\n2nd\nhMmax i and second largest Mmax\nfragments as a function of\nthe impact velocity v0 normalized by the critical velocity vc of\nfragmentation for two parameter sets. (b) Fragment mass distributions obtained for the limiting cases of tension, bending,\nand bending&healing dominated breakups giving the corresponding exponents \u03c4br , \u03c4sh , and \u03c4sh\u2212pl , respectively.\n\nand \u0398th are breaking thresholds which have fixed values\nfor all the beams. The two terms of Eq. (2) characterize\nthe contributions of the stretching and bending failure\nmodes of a beam. Simulations showed that the local\nshear of the particle contacts provides the main contribution to the bending angles \u0398i , \u0398j , so that bending\ndominated beam breaking in Eq. (2) characterizes crack\nformation due to shear. Varying the values of the breaking thresholds \u03b5th and \u0398th , the relative importance of\nstretching and bending can be controlled: increasing the\nvalue of a breaking parameter, the effect of the corresponding failure mode diminishes. An important feature\nof the breaking criterion is that in Eq. (2) the deformation\n\u03b5 is not restricted to positive values contrary to former\nsimulation studies on brittle fracture and fragmentation\n[7, 8, 11]. Since the first term of Eq. (2) becomes negative when the beam is compressed, failure is dominated\nby the bending/shear mode in such a way that increasing\ncompression increases the shear resistance of the beam.\nIn order to represent the plastic behavior of the material,\nwe assume that the beams have a linear elastic behavior\nup to fracture, but, whenever two particles are pressed\nagainst one another for a time longer than th , a new,\nundeformed beam is inserted between them. This way\nduring the impact process, the particle contacts may undergo a sequence of breaking-healing events which leads\nto plastic energy dissipation and to the appearance of\npermanent deformation. Varying the healing time th the\nmechanical response of the model material can be controlled: th = 0 corresponds to the case of perfect shear\nplasticity, while th \u2192 \u221e implies no healing at all, i.e.\nbrittle behavior.\nIn order to investigate the effect of local failure modes\nof beams on the fragmentation process, we carried out\ncomputer simulations by setting the stretching threshold to a fixed value \u03b5th = 0.02 and varying the bending\nthreshold within a broad range 1.0 \u2264 \u0398th \u2264 200. In this\nway \u0398th = 200 and \u0398th = 1 imply total tension and\nbending dominance, respectively, while intermediate \u0398th\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Probability distribution of the angle \u03a6\nbetween the velocity vector of fragments and the direction of\nimpact for tension \u0398th = 200 and shear \u0398th = 1.0 dominated\nbreakup. Insets: final states of fragmentation for tension (a)\nand shear (b) dominance. The arrows indicate the direction\nof the velocity of a few fragments.\n\nvalues interpolate between the two limits. Simulations\nwere stopped when the system reached a relaxed state,\ni.e. no beam breaking occurred during 1000 consecutive\ntime steps. Figure 1(b) presents the final state of an impact simulation obtained with a sample of N = 24000\nparticles at low impact velocity. It can be observed that\nthe model is able to reproduce both the deformation and\nthe crack structure of PP, with parameter values where\nthe beam breaking is dominated by bending \u0398th = 1.0,\nfurthermore, compressed contacts easily heal th = 0. The\nlarge permanent deformation of the sphere in Fig. 1(b)\narises due to breaking-healing sequences of particle contacts in the compressed impact zone. Above this zone\ntensile stresses arise resulting in opening cracks along the\nimpact direction in agreement with the experiments. Figure 3(a) presents the average mass of the largest hMmax i\n2nd\nfragments as a function of\nand second largest Mmax\nthe impact velocity v0 for the tension \u0398th = 200 dominated brittle breakup th = \u221e (tension), and for the\nbending dominated fragmentation \u0398th = 1.0 with perfect shear plasticity th = 0 (bending&healing). For low\nimpact velocities the sample gets only damaged, hence,\nthe largest fragment comprises nearly the entire mass M0\nof the body hMmax i \u223c M0 , while the second largest one is\n2nd\n\u226a hMmax i. Fragorders of magnitude smaller Mmax\nmentation occurs when the largest and second largest\npieces become comparable, i.e. at the critical velocity vc\n2nd\ncurve has a maximum coinciding with\nwhere the Mmax\nthe inflexion point of hMmax i. Figure 3(a) shows that\nfor the breakup of brittle materials dominated by tensile\nstresses, the damage-fragmentation transition is sharp in\nagreement with experiments [9, 10], however, when shear\nbreaking dominates a broad critical regime emerges. The\nreason is that at vc the largest fragment does not break\n\n\f4\nup into large pieces as for the tension case, but instead\ngradually erodes with a cleavage mechanism giving rise\nto a slowly decaying residue.\nRepresentative examples for the mass distribution of\nfragments are presented in Fig. 3(b) for three parameter\nsets. For the mass distribution of the tension dominated\nbreakup of heterogeneous brittle materials obtained at\nthe parameter values \u0398th = 200, th = \u221e (tension) a\npower law behavior is evidenced with the usual exponent \u03c4br = 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 [15]. Simulations showed that decreasing the healing time th \u2192 0 in the tension limit\npractically does not affect the fragmentation process because fragments are only generated by opening cracks\nwhich do not let healing play any role. It is important to emphasize that the breakup process substantially changes when shear dominates the crack formation\n\u0398th = 1 (bending). Even in the case of perfectly brittle\nbeam breaking th = \u221e the low shear resistance leads to\na significantly lower exponent than in the tensile limit\n\u03c4sh = 1.0 \u00b1 0.05 (see Fig. 3(b)). Increasing the strength\nof plasticity th \u2192 0 when shear dominates the cracking\n\u0398th = 1, the exponent of the fragment mass distribution\nslightly increases: due to the healing of cracks fragments\ncan merge which decreases the relative frequency of large\npieces leading to a faster decay of the distribution. The\nhighest value of the exponent \u03c4sh\u2212pl = 1.25 \u00b1 0.06 is obtained in the plastic limit th = 0 together with \u0398th = 1.0\n(bending& healing). It is important to emphasize that\nvarying solely the velocity of impact in Fig. 2, for the\nmass distribution of fragments an excellent agreement is\nobtained between the shear-plastic simulations and the\nexperiments. The results show that the shear dominated cracking together with the healing mechanism of\ncompressed crack surfaces are responsible for the unique\nfragmentation of plastic materials. During the impact\nprocess of the experiments a considerable fraction of the\nkinetic energy of the particle gets transformed into heat\nwhich enhances the effect of healing and plasticity in consistence with our theoretical results. Our extensive simulations indicate that the exponent \u03c4sh\u2212pl is universal,\ni.e. it does not depend on the impact velocity or on materials' microstructure characterizing a novel universality\nclass of fragmentation phenomena.\nDue to low shear resistance, we find that the fragmentation of plastic shows similarities to the breakup of liquid droplets colliding with a wall. The spatial distribution of fragments and the crack structure in the final state\nof brittle and plastic fragmentation are compared in the\ninsets of Fig. 4. Although meridional and segmentation\ncracks are clearly observed in the brittle case in agreement with experiments, a lateral spreading of fragments\nis obtained for plastic with shear dominated breaking.\nFor the quantitative characterization of the spatial spread\nof fragments, the distribution of the angle \u03a6 of the velocity vector of fragments with the impact direction (vertical) is presented in Fig. 4. It can be observed that most\n\nof the fragments bounce back from the hard wall when\ntension dominates, however, in the shear-plastic case the\nfragments escape laterally producing a \"splash\" of the\nentire body similar to liquid droplets [17, 18].\nIn conclusion, our experimental and theoretical study\nrevealed that the breakup of plastic materials falls into\na novel universality class of fragmentation phenomena\ncharacterized by the new mass distribution exponent.\nBased on discrete element simulations we showed that\nthe plastic behavior of the material together with the\ndominance of shear in crack formation are responsible\nfor the substantial difference from brittle fragmentation.\nThe low shear resistance of the material gives rise to a\nsplashing similar to the breakup of droplets of highly viscous liquids. Beyond the industrial importance of the\nfragmentation of polymeric materials, our results might\nalso be applied to obtain a deeper understanding of the\nfragmentation of highly viscous magma during pyroclastic activity at volcanic eruption [19, 20]. For theoretical\ninvestigations our results demonstrate that the breakup\nof solids cannot be understood as a generic stochastic\nprocess since the precise mechanism of crack initiation\nand growth, i.e. the dominance of tensile or shear stresses\ngovern the exponent of fragmentation. Still remains the\nchallenge to construct a theoretical approach which explains the emergence of universality based on crack dynamics.\nThe project was partially supported by the German\nFederal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi)\nvia AiF-Grant-No. 14516N.
