We give a combinatorial formula for the inverses of the alternating\nsums of free quasi-symmetric functions of the form F\u03c9(I) where I runs over compositions with parts in a prescribed set C. This proves in particular three special\ncases (no restriction, even parts, and all parts equal to 2) which were conjectured\nby B. C. V. Ung in [Proc. FPSAC'98, Toronto].\n\n1. Introduction\nThe algebra of Free Quasi-Symmetric Functions FQSym [5] is a graded algebra of\nnoncommutative polynomials whose bases are parametrized by permutations. Under\ncommutative image, it is mapped onto Gessel's algebra of quasi-symmetric functions,\nwhence its name.\nQuasi-symmetric functions generalize symmetric functions in a natural way, and\nmany classical results admit quasi-symmetric extensions or analogs. However, very\nfew results resembling symmetric series identities, like those of Schur or Littlewood\n(see, e.g., [11]) are known. In [15], B. C. V. Ung proves a quasi-symmetric analog\nof Schur's identity, and conjectures three further combinatorial inversions of quasisymmetric series, which are even stated at the level of FQSym.\nIn this note, we prove a master identity, which consists in a combinatorial formula\nfor the inverses of the alternating sums of free quasi-symmetric functions of the form\nF\u03c9(I) where I runs over compositions with parts in a prescribed set C. Here F\u03c3\ndenotes the standard basis of FQSym (mapped onto Gessel's fundamental basis),\nand \u03c9(I) is the longest permutation with descent composition I. Ung's conjectures\nboil down to the following special cases : no restriction on the parts, even parts, and\nall parts equal to 2.\nAcknowledgements.

Background and notations\n2.1. Free quasi-symmetric functions. Let A be a totally ordered alphabet. Recall that the standardized Std(w) of a word w \u2208 A\u2217 is the permutation obtained by\niteratively scanning w from left to right, and labelling 1, 2, . . . the occurrences of its\n1\n\n\f2\n\nF. HIVERT, J.-C. NOVELLI, AND J.-Y. THIBON\n\nsmallest letter, then numbering the occurrences of the next one, and so on. Alternatively, \u03c3 = Std(w)\u22121 can be characterized as the unique permutation of minimal\nlength such that w\u03c3 is a nondecreasing word. For example, Std(bbacab) = 341625.\nAn elementary observation, which is at the basis of the constructions of [5], is that\nthe noncommutative polynomials\nX\n(1)\nG\u03c3 (A) =\nw\nw\u2208A\u2217 ;Std(w)=\u03c3\n\nspan a subalgebra of QhAi. When A is infinite, this subalgebra admits a natural\nHopf algebra structure, but this fact will not be needed here. This is FQSym, the\nalgebra of Free Quasi-Symmetric Functions.\nLet F\u03c3 = G\u03c3\u22121 . The scalar product is defined by\n(2)\n\nhF\u03c3 , G\u03c4 i = \u03b4\u03c3,\u03c4 .\n\nFor a word w on the alphabet {1, 2, . . .}, denote by w[k] the word obtained by replacing each letter i by the integer i + k. If u and v are two words, with u of length\nk, one defines the shifted concatenation\n(3)\n\nu \u2022 v = u * (v[k])\n\nand the shifted shuffle\n(4)\n\nu\u22d2v =u\n\n(v[k]) .\n\nwhere u u\u2032 is the usual shuffle product on words.\nThe product formula in the F basis is\nX\n(5)\nF\u03b1 F\u03b2 =\nF\u03b3 .\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u03b1\u22d2\u03b2\n\nThe sum of the inverses of the permutations occuring in \u03b1\u22121 \u22d2\u03b2 \u22121 is called convolution\nand denoted by \u03b1\u22c6\u03b2. Thus, FQSym provides a realization of the convolution algebra\nof permutations studied in [13, 12].\n2.2. Descent classes and compositions. Recall that the descent set of a permutation \u03c3 is D = {i | \u03c3(i) > \u03c3(i + 1)}. If \u03c3 \u2208 Sn has descent set D = {d1 < . . . <\ndk } \u2286 [n \u2212 1], the descent composition I = C(\u03c3) is the composition I = (i1 , . . . , ik+1 )\nof n defined by is = ds \u2212 ds\u22121, where d0 = 0 and dk+1 = n. The symbol I \u000f n means\nthat I is a composition of n, and l(I) denotes the length of I.\nThe descent class DI = {\u03c3 \u2208 Sn | C(\u03c3) = I} has a unique element of minimal\n(resp. maximal) length denoted by \u03b1(I) (resp. \u03c9(I)). Actually, descent classes are\nintervals DI = [\u03b1(I), \u03c9(I)] for the left weak order on Sn (see, e.g., [3]).\nThe mirror image of a word w = a1 a2 * * * am is w\u0304 = am am\u22121 * * * a1 . We shall use\nthis notation for compositions and permutations as well.\nFinally, the diameter of a descent class is the permutation\n(6)\n\ndiam(I) := \u03b1(I)\u03c9(I)\u22121 = \u03b1(I)\u03c9(I).\n\n\fINVERSION OF SOME SERIES OF FREE QUASI-SYMMETRIC FUNCTIONS\n\n3\n\n2.3. A multiplicative basis of FQSym. The left-shifted concatenation of words is\n(7)\n\nif u \u2208 Ak , v \u2208 Al ,\n\nu \u25ee v = u[l] * v\n\nsimilar to the usual shifted concatenation \u2022, but with the shift on the first factor.\nThe following basis is introduced in [4]:\nX\n(8)\nS\u03c3 :=\nG\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u2264\u03c3\n\nwhere \u2264 is the left weak order. It has the property\nS\u03c3 = S\u03c31 S\u03c32 * * * S\u03c3r\n\n(9)\n\nwhenever \u03c3 = \u03c31 \u25ee \u03c32 \u25ee * * * \u25ee \u03c3r .\nThe Moebius function of the left weak order is explicitely known [6, 2, 3], and gives\nin particular\nX\n(10)\nG\u03c3 =\n(\u22121)l(I)\u22121 S\u03b1(I)\u03c3 .\nI\u0016C(\u03c3\u22121 )\n\n3.

Hence the result reduces to the\ncontribution of the empty permutation.\n\n4. Comments on Ung's other identities\nIn [15], Ung proves quasi-symmetric analogs of Schur's identity (for the sum of all\nSchur functions) and of Littlewood's identity (for its inverse). In fact, these analogs\nmay be formulated without further work at the level of FQSym.\nThe first identity is\n\"\n#\nX\n1\n1 Y 1 + xi\n\u2212 1 = [\u03bb1 (X)\u03c31 (X) \u2212 1]\n(16)\nFI =\n2 i 1 \u2212 xi\n2\nI\nwhere \u03bb1 (resp. \u03c31 ) is the sum of the elementary (resp. complete) symmetric functions.
