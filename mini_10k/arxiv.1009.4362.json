Introduction. The data-generating process of an epidemic has special\ncharacteristics to which one wants to pay particular attention when modeling\nthese data. First, the observed data of an infectious disease outbreak are\nlimited in the sense that the incidence-expressed as the number of newly\ninfected individuals as a function of time-is usually measured by symptom\nonset of disease, which is sometimes further accompanied by reporting delay.\nThus, all of the observed cases in the reported data represent those who\nexperienced infection at some point in time in the past. Second, epidemic\ndata sets do not usually include information on the number of susceptible\nindividuals as a function of time, but solely records infected (interpreted as\nsymptomatic) individuals. It is therefore unknown if susceptible individuals\nin the past are still susceptible at a point of time. Third, the susceptible\npopulation is usually not well defined at the beginning of an outbreak, and\nReceived January 2009; revised June 2009.\nKey words and phrases.

NISHIURA\n\nits size may vary with time due to time-dependency in contact behavior\nand public health countermeasures during the outbreak. In a veterinary\ncontext, the countermeasures might include a transportation ban during an\ninfectious disease outbreak on animal farms. Control measures are taken\nnot only to reduce the number of contacts, but also to limit the ability\nof infected individuals to generate secondary cases. For instance, one may\nthink of preemptive culling in the case of an infectious disease outbreak\non animal farms. Fourth, since the infection is transmitted from individual\nto individual, observation of an infected individual is not independent of\nobserving other individuals.\nThese characteristics lead us to consider developing a method which appropriately captures the dynamics of a directly transmitted infectious disease\nby modeling the number of infected-and-detected individuals, preferably in\ndiscrete time, in order to quantify the reproduction of infected individuals\nin a nonhomogeneous manner. This contrasts with other statistical models\nwhich measure the population of susceptibles and model the force of infection at which these susceptibles get infected.\nAs is usually assumed, one can think of a population in which an epidemic of an infectious disease occurs as consisting of three groups (or subpopulations) of individuals. The first is the susceptible population which\nrepresents individuals who have not been infected yet but may experience\ninfection in the future. The second is a population of infectious individuals\nwhich consists of those who have been infected and are infectious to others. The last group consists of removed or recovered individuals who are no\nlonger infectious and may be immune or are removed from the population.\nThe simplest type of the model which describes the transmission dynamics\nover time is referred to as an SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model\n[Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000)]. Since the present study will concentrate on the number of infected, here we consider their dynamics alone.\nLetting x(t) and y(t) be the susceptible and infectious fractions of the population at time t, respectively, the derivative of y(t) is expressed as\nd\ny(t) = \u03b2(t)y(t)x(t) \u2212 \u03bc(t)y(t).\ndt\nNote that the transmission rate \u03b2(t) and the removal rate \u03bc(t) may depend on time. If one rewrites the product of the transmission rate \u03b2(t) and\nsusceptibles x(t) as \u03bb(t) (= \u03b2(t)x(t)), then the equation is rewritten as\n(1.1)\n\nd\ny(t) = \u03bb(t)y(t) \u2212 \u03bc(t)y(t),\ndt\nwhich is the equation of the deterministic nonhomogeneous birth\u2013death process. The function \u03bb(t) has been referred to as the reproductive power and\ncan be interpreted as the rate at which a single infected individual is able\n(1.2)\n\n\fJOINTLY ESTIMATE REPRODUCTION AND REMOVAL\n\n3\n\nto generate secondary cases [Kendall (1948)]. In other words, \u03bb(t) is the\nrate at which an infected individual is able to reproduce itself. The so-called\ndeath rate \u03bc(t) in a birth\u2013death process is interpreted as the rate at which\nan infected individual is removed from the sub-population of infected individuals. It should be noted that equation (1.2) relaxed the definition of y(t)\ncompared to that in (1.1). Namely, whereas y(t) in (1.1) has to be infectious to others, we can instead regard y(t) in (1.2) as infected-and-detected\nindividuals (i.e., regardless of infectiousness).\nOne of the advantages of using this simple equation is that the population\nof susceptibles is allowed to vary over time. Therefore, the reproductive\npower varies over time due to two different reasons: (1) the population of\nsusceptibles x(t) varies as a function of time and (2) the transmission rate\n\u03b2(t) is nonhomogeneous over time. In addition, the removal rate \u03bc(t) is\nallowed to vary with time.\nIt can be an advantage to model infection process stochastically, because\none can explicitly define the probability of transmission, rather than deterministically stating if the transmission happens [Andersson and Britton\n(2000)]. A stochastic model can describe not only the quantitative patterns\nof observation with time-dependent expected values, but also offer standard\nerrors of the parameters without making adhoc distributional assumptions.\nMore importantly, the likelihood function can be explicitly derived, which\nwill be useful for statistical inference of parameters and critical assessments\nof the modeling method. Moreover, such a stochastic process can model the\nnumber of infected over time as being dependent.\nThe present study aims to develop a stochastic model which is based on a\nnonhomogeneous birth\u2013death process. The model is applied to an observed\ndata set of infected-and-detected (but not yet removed) cases, permitting\nreasonable assessment of the time course of an epidemic. In Section 2 the\nstochastic version of the nonhomogeneous birth\u2013death model is comprehensively described. A novel analytical solution of the model is obtained with the\nuse of a general Lagrange transformation derivation of which has not been\nexplicitly discussed to date. In Section 3 we discuss a conditional discretetime fitting method. Although a similar conditional fitting procedure was\nemployed in a recent study [van den Broek and Heesterbeek (2007)], the\npresent study is the first to apply the technique to a model where both\nbirth and death rates are nonhomogeneous. Depending on the model and\nthe data given, the number of parameters to be estimated can be large and\nit might be difficult to get stable estimates. Besides, a relationship between\nthe reproductive power and the removal rate might exist. Therefore, more\nrestricted models which employ this relationship are discussed in Section 4.\nIn Section 5 our model is applied to an observed epidemic data set of avian\ninfluenza A (H7N7) in the Netherlands, 2003.\n\n\f4\n\nJ. VAN DEN BROEK AND H. NISHIURA\n\n2. The nonhomogeneous birth\u2013death model. The stochastic differential\nequations for a nonhomogeneous birth\u2013death process, with Y (t) and y0 being\nthe number of infected-and-detected at time t and the initial number of\ninfected-and-detected at time 0, respectively, are as follows:\nd\npy (t) = \u03bb(t)(y \u2212 1)py\u22121 (t) + \u03bc(t)(y + 1)py+1 (t) \u2212 (\u03bb(t) + \u03bc(t))ypy (t),\ndt\nd\np0 (t) = \u03bc(t)p1 (t),\ndt\nwhere \u03bb(t) denotes the reproductive power, \u03bc(t) the death rate and Pr(Y (t) =\ny) = py (t) the probability that the number of infected-and-detected individuals at time t is y. It should be noted that here we consider Y (t) as the\nnumber of infected-and-detected individuals which represents the observed\nelements of the data and is irrelevant to infectiousness. If we take the probability generating function of the probabilities p, we can derive a partial\ndifferential equation for this fraction by multiplying the above differential\nequations with z y , summing the result, and taking the derivative. The analytical solution of the partial differential equation is [Kendall (1948)]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b8 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8)u y0\n.\n\u03a6(y, u) =\n1 \u2212 \u03c0u\nRt\nIf we write \u03c1(t) = 0 [\u03bc(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03bb(\u03c4 )] d\u03c4 = log[ SS\u03bb\u03bc (t)\n(t) ] and\nZ t\nZ t\ndS\u03bb (\u03c4 )\n\u03c1(\u03c4 )\n(2.1)\n,\ne \u03bb(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 = \u2212\n\u03b3(t) =\n0 S\u03bc (\u03c4 )\n0\nwe get\n(2.2)\n\n\u03b8 =1\u2212\n\nS\u03bc (t)\ne\u2212\u03c1(t)\n=1\u2212\n,\n\u2212\u03c1(t)\nS\u03bb (t) + \u03b3(t)S\u03bc (t)\n1 + \u03b3(t)e\n\n(2.3)\n\n\u03c0 =1\u2212\n\n1\nS\u03bb (t)\n=1\u2212\n.\nS\u03bb (t) + \u03b3(t)S\u03bc (t)\n1 + \u03b3(t)e\u2212\u03c1(t)\nRt\n\nIt should be noted that\nS\u03bb (t) = e\u2212 0 \u03bb(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 is the reproduction survival funcRt\ntion and S\u03bc (t) = e\u2212 0 \u03bc(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 is the removal survival function.\nTo obtain the probability distribution from \u03a6(y, u), the general Lagrange\ntransformation is useful (the details of which can be found elsewhere\ny0 =\n[Consul and Famoye (2006)]). First, let \u03a6(y, u) = [\u03b8 + (1 \u2212 \u03b8) (1\u2212\u03c0)u\n1\u2212\u03c0u ]\ny\n[\u03b8 + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03c8(u)] 0 , where \u03c8(u) is the probability generating function (pgf)\nof the geometric distribution. Second, let g(z) = 1 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0z, the pgf of a\nBernoulli distribution. Numerically, the smallest root of the transformation z = ug(z) defines a pgf z = \u03c8(u) = (1\u2212\u03c0)u\n1\u2212\u03c0u [Consul and Famoye (2006)].\n\n\f5\n\nJOINTLY ESTIMATE REPRODUCTION AND REMOVAL\n\nThird, additionally considering f (z) = (\u03b8 + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)z)y0 , the pgf of the discrete general Lagrange probability distribution under the Lagrange transy0 and, moreform z = ug(z) is given by f (z) = f (\u03c8(u)) = [\u03b8 + (1 \u2212 \u03b8) (1\u2212\u03c0)u\n1\u2212\u03c0u ]\nover, the probability mass function is a special case of the double-binomial\ndistribution [Consul and Famoye (2006), pages 22\u201327], which can be referred\nto as the Bernoulli-binomial Lagrangian distribution in the terminology of\n[Johnson, Kemp and Kotz (2005)]\nP (Y (t) = 0) = \u03b8 y0 ,\nP (Y (t) = y) =\n\ny 0 y0 y\n\u03b8 \u03c0\ny\n\n(2.4)\n\nmin(y\u22121,y0 \u22121) \u0012\n\nX\nk=0\n\ny0 \u2212 1\nk\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\ny\ny\u2212k\u22121\n\n\u0014\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03c0)(1 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\u00d7\n\u03c0\u03b8\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015k+1\n\n,\ny \u2265 1,\n\nwhere \u03b8 and \u03c0 are defined in equations (2.2) and (2.3). It should be noted\nthat g(z) and f (z) are pgf's and, thus, the necessary conditions for Lagrange transformation are satisfied. To the best of our knowledge, detailed\nderivation of equation (2.4) has never been discussed in the context of the\nnonhomogeneous birth\u2013death model (see Section 6).\nThe expectation and the variance of (2.4) are\n1\u2212\u03b8\n1\u2212\u03c0\nS\u03bc (t)\n= y0\n,\nS\u03bb (t)\n\nE(y) = y0\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b8)[\u03b8 + \u03c0(1 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0)]\n(1 \u2212 \u03c0)3\n\u0014\n\u0015\nS\u03bc (t)\nS\u03bc (t)\n= y0\n1 + (2\u03b3 \u2212 1)\nS\u03bb (t)\nS\u03bb (t)\n\nvar(y) = y0\n\n= y0 R(t)[1 + (2\u03b3 \u2212 1)R(t)]\nby using (2.2) and (2.3).\nThe expected value has two interpretations. The first part is the predicted number of infected individuals at time t0 who survived removal [i.e.,\ny0 S\u03bc (t)]. The second part, S\u03bb1(t) , measures the rate at which a nonremoved\ninfected individual reproduces itself. This is similar to an interpretation of\na nonhomogeneous birth process [van den Broek and Heesterbeek (2007)];\nthe difference of the present study from the previous nonhomogeneous birth\n\n\f6\n\nJ. VAN DEN BROEK AND H. NISHIURA\n\nprocess is that in the present setup only the predicted nonremoved infectedS (t)\nand-detected individuals reproduce. Second, the ratio of the rates S\u03bc\u03bb (t) is\nthe net reproduction ratio with which an infected individual reproduces itself, which is interpreted as the effective reproduction number R(t) as a\nfunction of epidemic time t. R(t) in the present study can be regarded as\nthe average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case at\ntime t. That is, our R(t) is an instantaneous measure of secondary transmissions occurring at time t, whose definition is equivalent to the period total\nfertility rate in mathematical demography [Nishiura and Chowell (2009)]. If\nR(t) < 1, it suggests that the epidemic is in decline and may be regarded as\nbeing \"under control\" at time t [vice versa, if R(t) > 1]. It should be noted\nthat the expected value of (2.4) is equivalent to an analytical solution of the\ndeterministic version of a nonhomogeneous birth\u2013death process (1.2).\nThe term \u03b3(t) in the formula for the variance represents the dependence\nbetween the birth and death rate as can be seen from (2.1). As it is clear\nfrom the analytical expression for the variance, the variance becomes large\nif the probability of nonremoval is large for an infected individual, if the\nprobability of reproduction is large, or both. This matches intuitive sense.\nIn addition, the variance can be regarded as a type of negative binomial\nvariance, if we rewrite it as var(y) = E(y)[1 + 2\u03b3\u22121\ny0 E(y)].\n3. Fitting the model. We have shown how the epidemic data can be generated by a stochastic nonhomogeneous birth\u2013death process. Nevertheless,\nthe observed data are, in reality, just one sample path of all the possible\nsample paths that can arise from such an epidemic process. Considering further that the number of infected-and-detected and individuals at a certain\npoint in time t depends on the number of infected-and-detected individuals at some time point before t, our model is fitted to the data by conditioning on the transmission dynamics which happened before t [Becker\n(1989), Becker and Yip (1989)]. Moreover, as we briefly discussed in the\nIntroduction, another important point in practice is the discrete nature of\nthe time points of observation, that is, say, tj , j = 0, 1, . . . , n, where the time\nunit might typically be days or weeks. Therefore, the number of infecteds at\ntime tj is modeled conditionally on the number of infecteds by time tj\u22121 .\nSince the probability mass function (2.4) is a conditional probability mass\nfunction, conditioning being on the number of infecteds at t0 , this can be\neffectively used as the conditional model for the number of infecteds at time\ntj , given the number of infecteds at time tj\u22121 . For this reason, the survival\ndistributions S\u03bb (t) and S\u03bc (t) and, of course, \u03b3(t), are also conditioned on\nthe past. Let T\u03bb and T\u03bc be the stochastic variables that measure the reproduction time and the removal time, respectively. The conditional survival\n\n\f7\n\nJOINTLY ESTIMATE REPRODUCTION AND REMOVAL\n\nprobability for the reproduction time is\nP (T\u03bb > tj |T\u03bb > tj\u22121 ) =\n\nS\u03bb (tj )\nS\u03bb (tj\u22121 )\n\n=1\u2212\n\nS\u03bb (tj\u22121 ) \u2212 S\u03bb (tj )\nS\u03bb (tj\u22121 )\n\n= 1 \u2212 P (T\u03bb \u2208 (tj\u22121 , tj ]|T\u03bb > tj\u22121 )\n= 1 \u2212 h\u03bb (tj\u22121 ),\nwhere h\u03bb (tj\u22121 ) is interpreted as the discrete reproductive power. Similarly,\nthe conditional survival probability for the removal time is given by\nP (T\u03bc > tj |T\u03bc > tj\u22121 ) = 1 \u2212 h\u03bc (tj\u22121 ),\nwhere h\u03bc (tj\u22121 ) is the discrete removal hazard.\nThe discrete conditional version of (2.1) in the time interval (tj\u22121 , tj ] is\nP (T\u03bb \u2208 (tj\u22121 , tj ]|T\u03bb > tj\u22121 )\nh\u03bb (tj\u22121 )\n=\n.\nP (T\u03bc > tj |T\u03bc > tj\u22121 )\n1 \u2212 h\u03bc (tj\u22121 )\nWhen these conditional discrete measurements are considered, \u03b8 and \u03c0 correspond to h\u03bc (tj\u22121 ) and h\u03bb (tj\u22121 ), respectively. Using these, the conditional\nprobability for (2.4) is expressed as\nP (Y (tj ) = 0|Y (tj\u22121 ) = ytj\u22121 ) = h\u03bc (tj\u22121 )y0 ,\nP (Y (tj ) = ytj |Y (tj\u22121 ) = ytj\u22121 )\nyt\n= j\u22121 h\u03bc (tj\u22121 )ytj\u22121 h\u03bb (tj\u22121 )ytj\nytj\n\u00d7\n\nmin(ytj \u22121,ytj\u22121 \u22121) \u0012\n\nX\nk=0\n\nytj\u22121 \u2212 1\nk\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nytj\nytj \u2212 k \u2212 1\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0014\n\n(1 \u2212 h\u03bb (tj\u22121 ))(1 \u2212 h\u03bc (tj\u22121 ))\n\u00d7\nh\u03bb (tj\u22121 )h\u03bc (tj\u22121 )\n1\u2212h (t\n\n\u0015k+1\n\n,\n\ny \u2265 1.\n\n)\n\nj\u22121\nThe expected value of this probability is ytj\u22121 1\u2212h\u03bb\u03bc (tj\u22121\n) , which is referred to\nas the sample path profile [Lindsey (2001)]. The corresponding conditional\n1\u2212h (tj\u22121 )\nmeasurement of the effective reproduction number is R(tj\u22121 ) = 1\u2212h\u03bb\u03bc (tj\u22121\n),\n\nS (t )\n\nS (t )\n\nj\n\u03bb j\nwith h\u03bc (tj\u22121 ) = 1 \u2212 S\u03bc\u03bc(tj\u22121\n) and h\u03bb (tj\u22121 ) = 1 \u2212 S\u03bb (tj\u22121 ) .\nLet \u2206 be the vector of parameters from the survival distributions (see\nSection 4). The log-likelihood function is then\n\nl(\u2206) =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nlog[P (Y (tj ) = ytj |Y (tj\u22121 ) = ytj\u22121 , \u2206)].\n\n\f8\n\nJ. VAN DEN BROEK AND H. NISHIURA\n\nNote that the likelihood is evaluated only for ytj > 0, because zero prevalence\nis the absorbing state of the process and this state is not observable in reality.\nThe log-likelihood can be maximized using an optimization procedure,\nsuch as the Nelder\u2013Mead method to find the maximum likelihood estimates.\nIn our exercise, the software system R [R Development Core Team (2008)]\nis used. The information matrix is used to find the standard errors of the\nparameters, and we use Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to compare\nmodel fits.\n4. The Burr distribution and its special cases. To choose a particular\nform for the survival functions, one might take the early phase of the outbreak into account. The mean of the probability mass function (2.4) depends\non these survival functions and is the same as the solution of (1.2). Since (1.2)\ncan be derived from the SIR model, one might look at the deterministic SIRmodel to decide the parametric form of the survival function. In the early\nphase of the outbreak a deterministic SIR-model can be well approximated\nby a deterministic SI-model since in that phase the number of removals is\nlimited. The dynamic equations for this SI-model hold for the fraction of\nsusceptibles and for the fraction of infected and since the fraction of susceptibles at a point of time is the same as the fraction of individuals with\ninfection time larger than that time point, the dynamic equations should\nalso hold for the survival function. The Burr family of distribution functions\nhas this precise property [van den Broek and Heesterbeek (2007)].\nWhen detection of a symptomatic infected individual occurs, he/she usually will be removed immediately. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the\nreproductive power and the removal rate have a similar structure, and follow\na similar survival function.\nThe most well-known and useful distribution from the Burr family is the\nBurr XII, or Singh\u2013Maddala distribution, which in the literature is sometimes referred to simply as the Burr distribution. The survival function is\ngiven by\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013a \u0015\u2212q\nt\n,\nt > 0, a, b, q > 0.\nS(t) = 1 +\nb\nThe right tail is governed by the parameters a and q, the left tail by a, and\nb is the scale parameter [Kleiber and Kotz (2003), page 198]. To reduce the\nnumber of parameters to be estimated, one can consider three special cases\nof the Burr distribution [Kleiber and Kotz (2003)]:\n1. The logistic form is obtained for q = 1, giving the log-logistic or the Fisk\ndistribution.\n2. For a = 1, the Burr distribution is reduced to the Lomax (Pareto type II)\ndistribution.\n\n\fJOINTLY ESTIMATE REPRODUCTION AND REMOVAL\n\n9\n\n3. The case a = q is also known as the para-logistic distribution.\nThe Weibull distribution and the Pareto distribution are limiting cases of\nthe Burr distribution [Shao (2004)]. An interesting way to arrive at the Burr\ndistribution is to assume that the times follow a Weibull distribution, the\nscale parameter of which follows an inverse generalized gamma distribution\n[Kleiber and Kotz (2003)].\nAs another way to reduce the number of model parameters, and to find a\nfurther relationship between the reproductive power and the removal rate,\none may rewrite the Burr distribution as a proportional rate or an accelerated event-time distribution (just as in the case of the more famous Weibull\ndistribution). Suppose that the survival function for the reproduction time\nis a Burr distribution with parameters a, b1 and q and suppose that the survival function of the removal time is also a Burr distribution with parameters\na, b2 and q. If we replace b2 by db1 (where d is a constant), we get\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u2032 \u0013a \u0015\u2212q\n\u0013 \u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013a \u0015\u2212q \u0014\nt a \u2212q\nt\nt\n= 1+\n= 1+\n= S\u03bb (t\u2032 ).\nS\u03bc (t) = 1 +\nb2\ndb1\nb1\nTherefore, the survival distribution for the removal times is exactly the same\nas that for the reproduction time, except that the removal time is interpreted\nas accelerated reproduction time.\nTo employ the proportional rate model, let the survival distribution for\nthe reproduction time be a Burr distribution with parameters a, b and q1 ,\nand suppose that the survival distribution of the removal times is also a\nBurr distribution with parameters a, b and q2 . If we replace q2 by cq1 (where\nc is a constant), we get\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013a \u0015\u2212q2 \u0014\n\u0012 \u0013a \u0015\u2212cq1 \u001a\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013a \u0015\u2212q1 \u001bc\nt\nt\nt\nS\u03bc (t) = 1 +\n= 1+\n= 1+\n= {S\u03bb (t)}c ,\nb\nb\nb\nindicating that the rates are proportional; that is, the rate at which an\ninfected-and-detected is removed is proportional to the rate at which an\ninfected-and-detected individual reproduces. Of course, the Burr distribution can also be written as both an accelerated event-time distribution and\nas a proportional rate distribution, that is, S\u03bc (t) = [S\u03bb (t\u2032 )]c .\nAll the distributions described above can be written in accelerated eventtime form and in proportional hazard form, except for log-logistic distribution which has only an accelerated event-time form. In the next section we\nfit all of those models to epidemic data of avian influenza A (H7N7) in the\nNetherlands, 2003.\n5. Dutch avian influenza A (H7N7) epidemic in 2003. Here we show an\nexample of our model application to an observed data set. An epidemic\nof avian influenza A (H7N7) virus started on February 28, 2003, in the\n\n\f10\n\nJ. VAN DEN BROEK AND H. NISHIURA\n\nGelderse Vallei in the Netherlands. In total, 239 flocks experienced infection\nwith known detection date. Control measures taken include movement restrictions, stamping out of infected flocks, and preemptive culling of flocks in\nthe neighborhood of infected flocks. As a result, 1255 commercial flocks and\n17,421 flocks of smallholders had to be depopulated, and approximately 25.6\nmillion animals were killed. The virus was also transmitted to humans who\nhad been in close contact with the infected chickens, resulting in one human\ndeath. Further details can be found elsewhere [Stegeman et al. (2003)].\nWe examine transmission and detection events between flocks. We regard\nthe detection date of a case (i.e., infected individual) as the date at which\nthere were first signs of infection in a flock. In other words, the detection\ndate of an infected individual is regarded as the birth date in our model.\nTherefore, the birth date is not the date of infection but the date at which an\ninfected farm is detected, which is used as a surrogate. Moreover, the date of\ndepopulation is regarded as the death date. Consequently, the Dutch data\nconsist of the prevalence of infected-and-detected (but not yet removed)\nflocks on each epidemic date.\nFigure 1 shows the temporal distribution of the prevalent cases (representing those who were born and have not been removed yet). As can be\nseen, the right tail contains gaps and the center of the distribution is not\nwell determined. Usually these make it difficult to fit simple models to the\ndata.\nThe Burr model with three parameters for birth rate and three for death\nrate was fitted to the observed data. We refer to it as the full Burr model.\nTo objectively show how this model fits to the data better than other types\nof models, we compared its likelihood with that of the full inverse Burr\n(Burr III or Dagum) model. The inverse Burr model is also known as a\nflexible distribution from the Burr family and can be viewed as a generalized\ngamma with a scale parameter that follows an inverse Weibull distribution\n[Kleiber and Kotz (2003)]. The inverse Burr yielded an AIC of 363.7, while\nthe full Burr model yielded 342.4. We thus examined the full Burr model\nTable 1\nAkaike's information criterion (AIC) for different models\nFull model Acc. event time1\nBurr\nLog-logistic\nLomax\nPara-logistic\n1\n2\n\n342.4\n371.3\n341.9\n351.8\n\nAccelerated event-time model.\nProportional rate model.\n\n345.90\n369.8\n344.8\n354.0\n\nProp. rate2\n\nBoth acc. event and prop. rate\n\n346.4\n\u2013\n344.9\n357.5\n\n342.7\n\u2013\nsame as full model\nsame as full model\n\n\fJOINTLY ESTIMATE REPRODUCTION AND REMOVAL\n\n11\n\nFig. 1. Temporal distribution of the prevalent cases of avian influenza A (H7N7) epidemic in the Netherlands, 2003. The index case was reported on February 28, 2003 (and\nthe date is defined as day 0). The prevalent cases represent those who have been infected\nand detected but have not been depopulated yet at day t, which correspond to the expected\nvalue of yt in Section 3. See Stegeman et al. 2003 for further information.\n\n(and its special cases) for further analyses. The AICs for these different\nmodels are in Table 1. The full Lomax model gave the best fit, although the\ndifference in AIC with the full Burr distribution was not particularly large. In\nother words, the information criterium suggest that both the death rate and\nthe reproductive power may be proportional and that the removal time may\nbe accelerated reproduction time in the observed data set. Figure 2 visually\nconfirms a good fit of the full Lomax model to the observed number of\ninfected-and-detected individuals based on the conditional model in discrete\ntime. The model seems to have well captured the observation, because fitting\nprevalence ytj to the data is conditioned on ytj\u22121 . It should be noted that\nthe predicted values in Figure 2 reflect a qualitative pattern of the observed\ndata always one or two steps late, which is a general tendency of conditional\nfit.\nParameter estimates for the best fitting model are shown in Table 2\nwith their standard errors. The logarithm of the acceleration factor, d,\nwas estimated at 1.47 with a standard error of 0.369, and the logarithm\nof the proportionality between the reproductive power and the removal rate\nwas 1.54 with a standard error of 0.355. The estimates of mean reproduction and removal times for the Lomax distribution can be calculated from\n[Kleiber and Kotz (2003)] E(t) = b\u0393(2)\u0393(q\u22121)\n. The mean reproduction time\n\u0393(q)\nwas estimated as 1.81, indicating that it takes on average 1.8 days for a detected case to reproduce another detected case. The mean removal time was\n\n\f12\n\nJ. VAN DEN BROEK AND H. NISHIURA\n\nFig. 2.

The index case was reported on February 28, 2003 (and the date is defined as day\n0). Observed data (bars) is compared with the predicted number of cases (solid line) based\non the full Lomax model. It should be noted that the expectation of prevalence ytj is conditioned on ytj\u22121 .\n\nestimated as 2.79, indicating that on average it takes 2.8 days for a detected\ninfected case to be removed.\nIn Figure 3 the rate at which a single case survives removal, (1 \u2212 h\u03bc (tj\u22121 )),\nis shown as a function of epidemic date. In addition, the rate at which a\nsingle nonremoved case reproduces secondary cases, (1/(1 \u2212 h\u03bb (tj\u22121 )), is\nalso shown in the figure. The product of these two functions jointly yields\nR(tj\u22121 ) (also shown in Figure 3). Compared with other modeling results\n[e.g., Nishiura and Chowell (2009)], our estimates of R(tj\u22121 ) are smoothed\nas a function of time owing to our parametric model for the survival functions of reproduction and removal. Nevertheless, it should be noted that our\n\n\fJOINTLY ESTIMATE REPRODUCTION AND REMOVAL\n\n13\n\nTable 2\nParameter estimates for the Lomax\ndistribution\nParameter\nln(b1 )\nln(q1 )\nln(b2 )\nln(q2 )\n\nEstimate\n\nSt. error\n\n3.235\n2.712\n4.987\n3.980\n\n0.5998\n0.3611\n1.0396\n0.8480\n\napproach does not have to assume that the generation time distribution is\nknown [i.e., common assumption in estimating R(t)], because our approach\ndoes not have to translate a growth rate of incidence to the reproduction\nnumber. As we discussed above, R(tj\u22121 ) < 1 suggests that the epidemic is\nin decline at time tj\u22121 [vice versa, if R(tj\u22121 ) > 1]. This can be understood\n\nFig. 3.

The product\n(1 \u2212 h\u03bc (tj\u22121 )) /(1 \u2212 h\u03bb (tj\u22121 )) yields the effective reproduction number R(t) as a function\nof time, which can be interpreted as the average number of secondary cases generated by\na single primary case at time tj\u22121 .

In our example, the expected value of R(tj\u22121 ) declined below unity for the first time on day 23 since\nthe detection of the index case, supporting eventual end of the epidemic in\nthe later stage. The sawtooth at the end of the lines is considered to have\nbeen caused by zero prevalence during the corresponding time period (i.e.,\nbecause of our conditional measurement, the survival functions reflect small\nvariations in the observed data). Figure 3(b) shows the estimated effective\nreproduction number R(tj\u22121 ). To get an idea of the statistical uncertainty of\nR(tj\u22121 ), 500 sample paths were drawn from the estimated nonhomogeneous\nbirth\u2013death model and for each sample path the effective reproduction number was calculated (gray lines). The 95% percentile lines of R(tj\u22121 ) are also\nshown.\n6. Discussion. In the present study we modeled an epidemic based on\nthe nonhomogeneous birth\u2013death process, addressing some of the critical\nissues which are seen in the observation of directly transmitted infectious\ndiseases. First, we modeled infected-and-detected individuals, which corresponds to observable and countable information in practice (e.g., our model\nrequires neither susceptibles nor infectious individuals). Second, for a similar\nreason, the application of a birth\u2013death process allowed the population at\nrisk (i.e., the susceptible population) to vary with time. Third, applying the\nconcepts of a nonhomogeneous birth\u2013death process to epidemic modeling,\ndependent events (i.e., dependence of a single infected individual on other\ninfected individuals) were addressed in the model. Fourth, our stochastic\nmodel offered an explicit likelihood function and yielded a standard error\nof parameters. Last, our model allowed estimation of the effective reproduction number, R(t). Although a different probability distribution was given\nby Bailey (1964), the derivation was not given in the literature, and, to the\nbest of our knowledge, equation (2.4) is the first to derive the pdf explicitly.\nIn a recent study van den Broek and Heesterbeek (2007) applied a nonhomogeneous birth process to epidemic data, in which the survival-time\ndistribution was modified by a final-size parameter to describe the end of\nan epidemic (which was influenced by public health countermeasures). The\ncountermeasures would not only reduce the final size of an epidemic but also\nthe reproductive power as a function of time, because secondary transmissions caused by infected individuals are restricted under the control measures. The nonhomogeneous birth process in the previous study permitted\nan explicit assessment of the time variations in the number of newly infected\nindividuals (and thus the reproductive power).\nIn the present study the proposed nonhomogeneous birth\u2013death process\nfurther improved our understanding of time dependency by explicitly adding\n\n\fJOINTLY ESTIMATE REPRODUCTION AND REMOVAL\n\n15\n\nthe nonhomogeneous removal rate. Whereas the reproductive power changes\nas a function of time due to variations in susceptible individuals or in the\ntransmission rate, the removal rate is also nonhomogeneous when infected\nindividuals are likely to be removed upon detection. Thus, adding nonhomogeneous death to a nonhomogeneous birth process enabled us to separately\nconsider the effectiveness of countermeasures as a reduction in reproductive\npower (e.g., reduction in infectious contacts) and an increase in removal rate\nof infected individuals (e.g., culling of infected farms). In this way, the fading out of an epidemic was modeled in a smoother way, as compared to the\nprevious model based on a nonhomogeneous birth process alone.\nMoreover, it should be noted that our model does not necessarily require a\nhomogeneous mixing assumption to describe contacts, because our assumptions of the time-dependent rates implicitly include those nonhomogeneities.\nFor example, our model allows time variations in susceptible individuals.\nNevertheless, our model only accounts for the nonhomogeneity with respect\nto time in an explicit manner, and understanding other heterogeneous aspects of transmission requires further information.\nOf course, there are many possible candidate distributions to model the\nreproduction and the removal times. We have selected the Burr distribution\nfor three reasons:\n1. As noted in Section 4, the Burr family coincides with our analytical understanding of the epidemic modeling, especially at the early stage of an\nepidemic.\n2. Essentially, the Burr distribution is flexible and has special and limiting cases. For instance, the distribution can be regarded as a Weibull\ndistribution with a random scale parameter.\n3. In the context of the present study, the proportional hazard rate and\nthe accelerated event time interpretation may be very helpful in model\nreduction and further interpretation of the data.\nAs an example, the nonhomogeneous birth\u2013death model was applied to\nepidemic data of avian influenza A (H7N7) in the Netherlands, 2003, showing\nthat the model fitted to the data very well. Indeed, since the data set has\ninformation on both birth and death events for each individual case, the\nDutch data appeared very useful for fitting prevalence data and applying\nour modeling method. Even in the presence of gaps in the right tail of the\nepidemic curve, and even though the center was not well determined, our\nmodel reasonably described the time-course of the observed epidemic. In\nparticular, our model permitted an estimation of the effective reproduction\nnumber R(t) as a function of time without imposing a specific distribution\nof the generation time.\nAs is often the case with natural outbreaks, a single observation represents just one sample path from the process for which the above-mentioned\n\n\f16\n\nJ. VAN DEN BROEK AND H. NISHIURA\n\nmodel is imposed as the generator. There is no random sampling of infectious disease outbreaks, and a repeated sampling interpretation for the\nresulting model fit might be difficult. In other words, the description and\nconclusions arising from analysis of a single outbreak data set is valid only\nfor that outbreak. To find some general disease-specific conclusions from\nsuch an exercise, we stress that it is important to analyze several different\noutbreaks for the same disease. For such a purpose, one may use our model\nto accumulate the experience of applying our method to several outbreaks.\nAcknowledgments.
