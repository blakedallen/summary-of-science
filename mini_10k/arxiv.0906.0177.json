Introduction\nInitially, we were interested in studying certain properties of the Pitman asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE)\nbetween Pearson's, Kendall's, and Spearman's correlation coefficients. As is well known (see e.g. [69]), the\nstandard expression for the Pitman ARE is applicable when the distributions of the corresponding test\nstatistics are close to normality uniformly over a neighborhood of the null set of distributions. Such uniform\ncloseness can usually be provided by Berry-Esseen (BE) type of bounds.\nBE bounds, especially in the special case of linear statistics, constitute a well-established area of research, which originated mainly in work by Scandinavian authors, who were to a large degree concerned\nwith applications in insurance industry and published many of their results on the accuracy of the normal\napproximation in actuarial journals. For a small sample of recent uses of BE bounds in various areas of\nsciences and engineering (again for linear statistics), see e.g. [42, 58, 59, 61, 118].\nKendall's and Spearman's correlation coefficients are instances of U -statistics, for which BE bounds are\nwell known; see e.g. [56]. As for the Pearson statistic (say R), we have not been able to find a BE bound in\nthe literature.\nThis may not be very surprising, considering that an optimal BE bound for the somewhat similar (and,\nperhaps, somewhat simpler) Student's statistic was obtained only in 1996, by Bentkus and G\u00f6tze [7] for\nindependent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables (r.v.'s) and by Bentkus, Bloznelis and G\u00f6tze [5]\nin the general, non-i.i.d. case. A necessary and sufficient condition, in the i.i.d. case, for the Student statistic\nto be asymptotically standard normal was established only in 1997 by Gin\u00e9, G\u00f6tze and Mason\n[31], and Hall\n\u0001\nand Wang [37] derive the leading term in the convergence rate in this general setting. For more recent\ndevelopments concerning the Student statistic, see e.g. Shao [105] and Pinelis [83].\nEmploying such simple and standard tools as a delta-method type linearization together with the Chebyshev and Rosenthal inequalities, we quickly obtained (in the i.i.d. case) a uniform bound of the form O(n\u22121/3 )\nfor the Pearson statistic.\nPn Indeed, Pearson's R can be expressed as f (V ), a smooth nonlinear function of the\nsample mean V = n1 i=1 Vi , where the Vi 's are independent zero-mean random vectors constructed based\non the observations of a random sample; cf. (4.40).\nPn A natural approximation to f (V ) \u2212 f (0), obtained by the\ndelta method, is the linear statistic L(V ) = i=1 L( n1 Vi ), where L is the linear functional that is the first\nderivative of f at the origin. Since BE bounds for linear statistics is a well-studied subject, we are left with\nestimating the closeness between f (V ) and L(V ). Assuming f is smooth enough, one will have |f (V ) \u2212 L(V )|\non the order of kV k2 , and so, demonstrating the smallness of this remainder term becomes the main problem.\nUsing (instead of the mentioned Rosenthal inequality) exponential inequalities for sums of random vectors\ndue to Pinelis and Sakhanenko [97] or Pinelis [79,80], for each p \u2208 (2, 3), under the assumption of the finiteness\nof the pth moment of the norm of the Vi 's, one can obtain a uniform bound of the form O(1/np/2\u22121 ),\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n3\n\nwhich is similar to the BE bound for a linear statistic with a comparable moment restriction. However, the\ncorresponding constant factor in the O(1/np/2\u22121\n\u221a ) will then explode to infinity\n\u221a as p \u2191 3. As for p > 3, this\nmethod produces bounds of order O((ln n)3/2 / n) (for p = 3) and O((ln n)/ n) (for p > 3), with the extra\nlogarithmic factors.\nWhile any of these bounds would have sufficed as far as the ARE is concerned, we became interested in\nobtaining an optimal-rate BE bound for the Pearson statistic. Soon after that, we came across the remarkable\npaper by Chen and Shao [13]. Suppose that T is any nonlinear statistic and W is any linear one, and let\n\u2206 := T \u2212 W ; then make the simple observation that\n\u2212 P(z \u2212 |\u2206| 6 W 6 z) 6 P(T 6 z) \u2212 P(W 6 z) 6 P(z 6 W 6 z + |\u2206|)\nfor all z \u2208 R. Chen and Shao [13] offer a Stein-type method to provide relatively simple bounds on the\ntwo concentration probabilities in the above inequality, hence bounding the distance between T and W ; the\nreader is referred e.g. to [3] for illustrations of the elegance and power of Stein's method to a wide array of\nproblems. Chen and Shao provided a number of applications of their general results.\nHowever, in the applications that we desired, such as to Pearson's R, it was difficult to deal with \u2206 =\nT \u2212 W , as defined above. The simple cure applied here was to allow for any \u2206 > |T \u2212 W |, so that, for\nT = f (V ), W = L(V ), and smooth enough f , the random variable\u221a\u2206 could be taken as kV k2 (up to some\nmultiplicative constant). This allowed for a BE bound of order O(1/ n), though under the excessive moment\nrestriction that EkVi k4 < \u221e.\n\u221a\nTo obtain a BE bound of the \"optimal\" order O(1/ n) using only the assumption EkVi k3 < \u221e, we\ncombine the Chen-Shao technique with a Cram\u00e9r-type tilt transform. Yet another modification was made\nby introducing a second level of truncation, to obtain a bound of order O(1/np/2\u22121 ) in the case when\nEkVi kp < \u221e for p \u2208 (2, 3). Thus we obtain our first group of main results (presented in Section 2), on\nthe closeness in distribution of general abstract nonlinear statistics to linear ones. These results may be\nrepresented by Theorem 2.4, which provides a \"nonuniform\" upper bound on | P(T > z) \u2212 P(W > z)| (that\nis, an upper bound which decreases to 0 in |z|), for a general abstract nonlinear statistic T and a general\nlinear statistic W ; a \"uniform\" bound on | P(T > z) \u2212 P(W > z)| is given by Theorem 2.1.\nThe other kind of main results, based on Theorems 2.1 and 2.4, is presented in Section 3. For instance,\nTheorem 3.6 provides a nonuniform upper bound on | P(f (S) > z)\u2212P(L(S) > z)| and thus may be considered\nas a bound on the rate of convergence in the delta method for vector statistics; it is the latter bound that\ntook more of our time and effort. The reader is referred to [110] for a rather detailed description of the\ndelta method and its applications; see [57, 101] for a more modern treatment of the delta method applied to\ninfinite-dimensional random vectors.\nFinally, as applications of the delta-method bounds given in Section 3, we present (in Section 4) uniform\nand nonuniform BE-type bounds for the Pearson statistic, the noncentral Student and Hotelling statistics,\nvarious statistics commonly used in testing hypotheses about a population covariance matrix, the largest\neigenvalue of a certain linear operator on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and maximum likelihood\nestimators. No such BE bounds appear to be previously known, except for uniform BE bounds for MLEs.\nAs for the known BE bounds for the central Student statistic (obtained by specialized methods, targeting\nthis specific statistic), it turns out that our bounds (even though based on the mentioned results for general\nnonlinear statistics) compare well with the former ones.\nOur general BE bounds in the multivariate delta method can of course be used in applications other than\nthe ones considered here; we mention a number of other potential applications in Subsections 4.5 and 4.6. In\nfact, a result from an earlier arXiv version of this paper, similar to Theorem 3.8, was already used in [28].\nOf course, our results cannot perfectly cover the entire variety of uses of the delta method; they may require\nmodification or use of different ideas; see e.g. [115, pages 1198 and 1211].\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n4\n\nTo obtain the delta-method bounds stated in Sections 3 and their applications presented in Section 4,\nwe use a number of previously known results, including precise exponential and Rosenthal-type bounds\ndeveloped by Pinelis, Sakhanenko, and Utev [79, 95\u201398] and also a number of other known results due to\nBennett [4], Hoeffding [40], de Acosta and Samur [20], Michel [62], and Shevtsova [107]. There we also use\nthe recent results developed in [83\u201393].\nAs for the requirement that the observations be identically distributed, it may (and will) be dispensed\nin general; that is, V will in general be replaced by a sum S of independent but not necessarily identically\ndistributed random vectors.\nThe paper is organized as follows.\n- In Section 2, we state and discuss the mentioned upper bounds on | P(T > z) \u2212 P(W > z)| for general T\nand W .\n- In Section 3, the mentioned Theorem 3.6 and other results are stated, providing general bounds on the\nrate of convergence in the vector delta method, that is, bounds on | P(f (S) > z) \u2212 P(L(S) > z)|.\n- Applications to several commonly used statistics, namely the non-central Student T , the Pearson R, the\nnon-central Hotelling T 2 , various test statistics constructed from a sample covariance matrix, the largest\neigenvalue of a certain linear operator, and maximum likelihood estimators are stated in Section 4.\n- Proofs of results from Sections 2 and 3, as well as selected results from Section 4, are deferred to Section 5.\nCertain results and proofs are relegated to appendices.\n- The statement and proof of an explicit (and quite complicated in appearance) nonuniform bound on the\ndistance to normality of f (V ) in an i.i.d. setting is provided in Appendix A.\n\u221a\n- The nonuniform bounds developed in this paper are valid under the restriction that z = O( n) (in the\ni.i.d. case); in Appendix B we prove that this restriction cannot generally be discarded or even relaxed.\n- Appendix C contains the proofs of bounds from Section 4 which, for practical purposes, make the use of\na computer algebra system (CAS) preferable.\n- In Appendix D, we discuss the potential application of the bounds presented in Section 3 to the Fisher\nz-transform of the Pearson statistic.\n- In Appendix E we provide a short, self-contained proof of the compactness of the covariance operator for\na random vector taking values in a separable Hilbert space and possessing a finite second moment; this is\nused in one of our applications on the principal component of a certain linear operator.\n- In Appendix F we outline the proof of the existence of the spectral decomposition for the covariance\noperator of a random vector taking values in an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space.\n2. Approximation of the distributions of general abstract nonlinear statistics by the\ndistributions of linear ones\nLet X1 , . . . , Xn be independent r.v.'s with values in some measurable space X, and let T : Xn \u2192 R be\na Borel-measurable function. For brevity, let T also stand for T (X1 , . . . , Xn ), the statistic of the random\nsample (Xi )ni=1 . Further let\n\u03bei := gi (Xi ) and \u03b7i := hi (Xi )\n(2.1)\nfor i = 1, . . . , n, where gi : X \u2192 R and hi : X \u2192 R are Borel-measurable functions.

Let \u2206 be any r.v. such that |\u2206| > |T \u2212 W | almost surely (a.s.), and for each i = 1, . . . , n,\nlet \u2206i be any r.v. such that Xi and (\u2206i , W \u2212 \u03bei ) are independent. Take any real number w > 0, and let \u2206\nbe any r.v. such that\nn\no\n\u2206 = \u2206 a.s. on the event max \u03b7i 6 w .\n(2.5)\n16i6n\n\nThen for all z \u2208 R\nP(T > z) \u2212 P(W > z) 6\n\n\u0011\nn\n\u0001\nP\n1 \u0010\n4\u03b4 + E W \u2206 +\nE \u03bei (\u2206 \u2212 \u2206i ) + P maxi \u03b7i > w ,\n2c\u2217\ni=1\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is any number satisfying (2.4).\nRemark 2.2. Sacrificing some simplicity in appearance, one can improve the bound in (2.6) by replacing the\nterm 4\u03b4 there with\ns\n\u0011\nP\n1 \u0010\n\u03b42\n\u03b42\n+ 2\u03b4\n2\u03b4 +\n+ E W \u2206 + i E \u03bei (\u2206 \u2212 \u2206i ) ;\n(2.7)\n2\u03b4 +\nc\u2217\n2c\u2217\n2c\u2217\nthe validity of (2.6) after such a replacement will be shown in the proof of Theorem 2.1. Evidently, when\nthe upper bound in (2.6) is small, the expression (2.7) will behave like 2\u03b4, in place of 4\u03b4 in (2.6).\nRemark 2.3. Inequality (2.6) above is a rather straightforward generalization of the result (2.3) in Theorem 2.1 by Chen and Shao [13]. The modifications we have made are as follows. First, \u2206 was defined in [13]\nas simply equal to T \u2212 W . Then, in the applications given in our present paper, it becomes problematic\nto\n\u0001\nbound the term E |\u03bei (T \u2212 W \u2212 \u2206i )| which would arise in place of the term E |\u03bei (\u2206 \u2212 \u2206i )| in (2.6) . Using\nthe more general condition |\u2206| > |T \u2212 W | instead of \u2206 = T \u2212 W allows one to choose a possibly larger \u2206\nso that E |\u03bei (\u2206 \u2212 \u2206i )| be more amenable to analysis. However, if that \u2206 should happen to be \"too large,\"\nour second generalization allows one to truncate \u2206 to within acceptable constraints by using the additional\ntruncation level w, as well as \u2206 and P(maxi \u03b7i > w). The third difference is that in [13] c\u2217 was chosen to be\n1\n2 ; the more general condition c\u2217 \u2208 (0, 1) results in improved explicit constants in the applications.\nBefore stating the \"nonuniform\" counterpart of Theorem 2.1, let us introduce some notation. For any real\na and b, let a \u2227 b and a \u2228 b denote the minimum and maximum, respectively, of a and b; use also the notation\na+ := a \u2228 0. For any real-valued r.v. \u03be and any p \u2208 [1, \u221e), let k\u03bekp := E1/p |\u03be|p .

Let here \u03b6 := (\u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6n ), where \u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6n are independent\nreal-valued r.v.'s, S := i \u03b6i , and\nG\u03b6 (z) :=\n\nn\nP\n\nP(\u03b6i > z)\n\nfor all\n\nz \u2208 R.\n\n(2.9)\n\ni=1\n\nIf the \u03b6i 's are zero-mean, then for each real \u03b1 > 2 there exist positive constants AR (\u03b1) and BR (\u03b1),\ndepending only on \u03b1, such that\n\u03b1\nkSk\u03b1\n\u03b1 6 AR (\u03b1)\n\n\u03b1\ni k\u03b6i k\u03b1\n\nP\n\n+ BR (\u03b1)\u03b1\n\n\u0010P\n\n2\ni k\u03b6i k2\n\n\u0011\u03b1/2\n\n.\n\n(2.10)\n\nSuch a result will be referred to in this paper as a Rosenthal-type inequality, since it was first obtained\nby Rosenthal in [102, Theorem 3]; however, the constants there were too large, as e.g. compared with ones\nin [90, 92]; cf. also (4.2). If the \u03b6i 's are not centered, a similar inequality can be obtained. Namely,\n\u03b1\nkS \u2212 E Sk\u03b1\n\u03b1 6 AR,nc (\u03b1)\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\ni k\u03b6i k\u03b1 + BR,nc (\u03b1)\n\nP\n\n\u0010P\n\n2\ni k\u03b6i k2\n\n\u0011\u03b1/2\n\n(2.11)\n\nfor any \u03b1 > 2 and some positive constants AR,nc (\u03b1) and BR,nc (\u03b1); see e.g. [90, Corollary 4].\nNext, we shall need upper bounds on the tail probabilities. Suppose now that G\u03b6 (y) = 0 for some y > 0,\ni.e. each of the \u03b6i 's is bounded from above a.s. by y. Then [98, Theorem 2] implies that for any \u03bb > 0\nn \u03bb2\n\b\ne\u03bby \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03bby 2 o\nB 2 (1 \u2212 \u03b5) +\nB \u03b5 ,\n(2.12)\nE exp \u03bb(S \u2212 m) 6 PUexp (\u03bb, y, B, \u03b5) := exp\n2\ny2\nP\nP\np\n2 p\u22122\nwhere B = ( i E \u03b6i2 )1/2 < \u221e, m = E S, \u03b5 =\n) \u2208 (0, 1), and p \u2208 [2, 3].

The bounds PUexp and PUtail can\nbe much less than BHexp and BHtail , respectively, when \u03b5 is significantly less than 1. Expressions for PUtail are\ngiven in [98, Corollary 1] and [93, Proposition 3.1], and Lemma A.1 will present these in a manner useful for\nthe applications considered in the present paper. We remark here that an exponential bound on E e\u03bb(S\u2212m)\n(and hence also P(S > x)) which incorporates the moments E(\u03b6i )p+ with p > 3 is stated in [98, Theorem 6],\nthough the resulting expression is considerably more complicated in appearance than the bound in (2.12).\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n7\n\nIn the proof of Theorem 2.4 stated below, we shall also have cause to find a lower bound\np for the exponential\nmoment of a Winsorized r.v.

Let \u2206 be any r.v. such that |\u2206| > |T \u2212 W | a.s. For each i = 1, . . . , n, let \u2206i be any r.v. such\nthat Xi and (\u2206i , (Xj : j 6= i)) are independent, and assume that the mentioned Borel-measurable functions\np\ngi and hi are such that gi 6 hi , so that \u03bei 6 \u03b7i .

The bound (2.18) (as well as other nonuniform\u0001 bounds presented later\n\u0001 in this paper) is stated\nonly for z > 0, which allows for one-tail expressions G\u03be \u03c02 z and P W \u2212 \u03bei > \u03c03 z to be used in (2.20). In\norder to obtain the corresponding bound for z < 0, all that is needed is to replace T and gi with \u2212T and\n\u2212gi , respectively, where the gi 's are as in (2.1).\nRemark 2.7. A simple modification of [13, Remark 2.1] shows us that (2.4) is satisfied when\n\u03b4=\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00111/(p\u22122)\n(p \u2212 2)p\u22122\n\u03c3pp/(p\u22122)\np\u22121\n(p \u2212 1) (1 \u2212 c\u2217 )\n\n(2.27)\n\nfor any p \u2208 (2, 3]. A smaller choice of \u03b4 exists for p = 3: according to [91, Theorem 1], (2.4) holds if \u03c33 < \u221e\nand\n\uf8f1\n3\n\uf8f4\nif 0 < c\u2217 6 12 ,\n\uf8f2c\u2217 \u03c33\n\u03b4 = \u03c3 3 \u2212 (2c\u2217 \u2212 1)2 /\u03c31\n(2.28)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 3\nif 12 6 c\u2217 < 1.\n4(1 \u2212 c\u2217 )\nRemark 2.8. It is easy to see that the expressions c1 , c2 , and c3 in (2.22)\u2013(2.24) can be bounded by finite\npositive constants depending only on the values of the parameters p, c\u2217 , \u03b8, w, and \u03b40 (and not on the distributions of the Xi 's). This follows because PUexp is nondecreasing in \u03b5 (recall (2.14)) and a1 6 1/LW ;pw/\u03b8,1/w\n(since maxi k\u03bei k2 6 kW k2 = 1 and LW ; c,B is nonincreasing in B). Thus, one may refer to c1 , c2 , and c3 as\npre-constants.\nRemark 2.9. If we add the assumption that the \u03bei 's are all symmetric(ally distributed) to the assumptions\nof Theorem 2.4, then, according to the main result of [89], (epw/\u03b8 \u2212 1)/w in (2.23) may be replaced by\nthe smaller quantity sinh(pw/\u03b8)/w. This sharpening of the inequality (2.18) allows for smaller absolute\nconstants to be obtained in applications of Theorem 2.4; cf. the nonuniform bound for the self-normalized\nsum in Corollary 4.12 and Remark 4.13.\nFor p = 2, the result of Theorem 2.4 is similar to that by Chen and Shao [13, Theorem 2.2]. The bound\ngiven by (2.18) turns out to be more precise in the applications given in this paper. In particular, it allows\n2\none to weaken conditions on moments. Indeed, in Theorem 3.6\nPnone will have |\u2206| on the order of kSk and\n|\u2206 \u2212 \u2206i | on the order of kXi k2 + kXi k kS \u2212 Xi k, where S := i=1 Xi and the Xi 's are independent random\nvectors. So, using Theorem 2.4 with p = 3 (and hence q = 23 ) in order to obtain a bound of the classical form\n1\nO( \u221an(|z|+1)\n3 ), one will need only the third moments of kXi k to be finite. On the other hand, using (2.21)\nwith p = 2 to get the same kind of bound would require the finiteness of the fourth moments of kXi k.\nExpressions in Theorem 2.4 are complicated, especially the ones for c1 , c2 , and c3 . However, this may be\nconsidered as just another instance of the usual trade-off between accuracy and complexity of the bounds.\nBounds (2.6) and (2.18) on the closeness of the distribution of the linear approximation W to that of the\noriginal statistic T are to be complemented by any number of well-known BE-type bounds on the closeness\nof the distribution of the linear statistic W to the standard normal distribution; the reader may be referred\nto Petrov's monograph [75, Chapter V] or the paper [87].

Let\nX1 , . . . , Xn be independent random vectors in X with E Xi = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n, and also let\nn\nP\n\nS :=\n\nXi ,\n\ni=1\n1/p\n\nkXkp := E kXkp ,\n\u0012 n\n\u00131/p \u0012 n\n\u00131/p\nP\nP\n,\nsp :=\nkXi kpp\n=\nEkXi kp\ni=1\n\n(3.1)\n\ni=1\n\nGX (z) :=\n\nn\nP\n\n\u0001\nP kXi k > z ,\n\n(3.2)\n\ni=1\n\nfor any p > 1 and z > 0; compare (3.1) and (3.2) to (2.8) and (2.9), respectively.\nNote that the results of [97, Theorem 1] (see also the remark in [98, p. 343]) may be used to derive\nbounds analogous to those given in (2.12) and (2.13) when the \u03b6i 's take values in a separable Banach space.\nParticularly,\n(2.13) and (2.12) hold under (2.15) when S and \u03b6i are replaced by kSk and kXi k, respectively.\n\n(3.3)\n\nSince X is of type 2 and the Xi 's are zero-mean, there exists a constant D := D(X) \u2208 (0, \u221e) such that\nkSk2 6 Ds2 .\n\n(3.4)\n\nWe shall assume that D is chosen to be minimal with respect to this property; so, D = 1 with the equality in\n(3.4) whenever X is a Hilbert space. By [96, Theorem 2] or [90], one also has the Rosenthal-type inequality\n\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u03b1 \u03b1\nkSk\u03b1\n\u03b1 6 AX (\u03b1) s\u03b1 + BX (\u03b1) s2\n\n(3.5)\n\nfor any \u03b1 > 2 and some pair of constants (AX (\u03b1), BX (\u03b1)); note that (3.5) generalizes (2.10).\nRemark 3.1. The results of this section hold for vector martingales taking values in a 2-smooth separable\nBanach space; in such a case, one can apply results of [79] instead of the ones of [97] used in the present\npaper. By [41, 79], every 2-smooth Banach space is of type 2. It is known that Lp spaces are 2-smooth, and\nhence of type 2, for all p > 2 [79, Proposition 2.1].\nLet next f : X \u2192 R be a Borel-measurable functional with f (0) = 0, satisfying the following smoothness\ncondition: there exist \u000f \u2208 (0, \u221e), M\u000f \u2208 (0, \u221e), and a nonzero continuous linear functional L : X \u2192 R such\nthat\nf (x) \u2212 L(x) 6\n\nM\u000f\nkxk2 for all x \u2208 X with kxk 6 \u000f;\n2\n\n(3.6)\n\nthus, L necessarily coincides with the first Fr\u00e9chet derivative, f 0 (0), of the function f at 0. Moreover, for the\nsmoothness condition (3.6) to hold, it is enough that the second derivative f 00 (x) exist and be bounded (in\nthe operator norm) by M\u000f over all x \u2208 X with kxk 6 \u000f.\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n10\n\nRemark 3.2. A fact useful in applications is that the smoothness condition (3.6) continues to hold over\ncompositions of functions. Specifically, suppose that X, Y, and Z are separable Banach spaces with respective\nnorms k*kX , k*kY , and k*kZ , and let h : X \u2192 Y and g : Y \u2192 Z be functions such that\nkh(x) \u2212 Lh (x)kY 6\n\nMh\n2\n\nkxk2X for all x \u2208 X with kxkX 6 \u000fh\n\n(3.7)\n\nkyk2Y for all y \u2208 Y with kykY 6 \u000fg\n\n(3.8)\n\nand\nkg(y) \u2212 Lg (y)kZ 6\n\nMg\n2\n\nfor some continuous linear operators Lh : X \u2192 Y, Lg : Y \u2192 Z and positive real numbers Mh , \u000fh , Mg , \u000fg . Then\nthe composition f := g \u25e6 h : X \u2192 Z satisfies (3.6) with Z in place of R, L = Lg \u25e6 Lh , M\u000f = Mh kLg k + Mg m2h ,\nmh := kLh k + Mh \u000fh /2, and \u000f = \u000fh , provided that \u000fh is chosen small enough to ensure mh \u000fh 6 \u000fg . Such a\nstatement can of course be generalized to the composition of any finite number of functions. We shall prove\nthis assertion in Section 5.\nGiven a function f which satisfies the smoothness condition (3.6), let us define\n\u03c3 := kL(S)k2 =\n\n\u0010P\n\n2\ni kL(Xi )k2\n\n\u00111/2\n\n;\n\n(3.9)\n\nfurther assume that \u03c3 \u2208 (0, \u221e). In (2.1), take gi (x) \u2261 L(x)/\u03c3 for each i = 1, . . . , n, so that\n\u03bei =\n\nL(Xi )\n;\n\u03c3\n\n(3.10)\n\nit is clear then that (2.2) is satisfied, and W = L(S)/\u03c3 according to (2.3).\nThe following bound for the distribution of f (S) may still look rather abstract and complicated. However,\nespecially in such applications to specific statistics as the ones presented in Corollaries 4.10 and 4.22, it\nleads to comparatively simple BE type bounds of a \"correct\" order of magnitude and with explicit numerical\nconstants of rather moderate sizes.\nTheorem 3.3. Let f : X \u2192 R satisfy (3.6), and let X1 , . . . , Xn be independent zero-mean random vectors\np\n, so that p1 + 1q = 1. Then for all z \u2208 R\nin X. Further, take any p \u2208 (2, 3], c\u2217 \u2208 (0, 1), w > 0, and let q := p\u22121\n\u0001\n\u0010 f (S)\n\u0011\n\u0010 L(S)\n\u0011\n\u0001 4\u03b4 + AR (p)\u03c3p + BR (p) u + \u03c3p v\nP\n>z \u2212P\n> z 6 P kSk > \u000f +\n+ G\u03b7 (w),\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n2c\u2217\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is any number satisfying (2.4), \u03c3p and G\u03b7 are as in (2.8) and (2.9) with\nkLkkXi k\nI{2 < p < 3},\n\u03c3\n(\n\u0001\nAX (3)2 \u03bb23 + BX (3)2 \u03bb22\nif p = 3,\nM\u000f \u03c3\n\u0001\nu :=\n\u00d7\n2kLk2\nif\np \u2208 (2, 3),\n5w2 AX (2q)2 \u03bbpp\u22121 + BX (2q)2 \u03bb22 + \u03bb2p\np\n(\n\u0001\nif p = 3,\n\u03bb23 + 2D\u03bb2 \u03bb3/2\nM\u000f \u03c3\n\u0001\nv :=\n\u00d7\np\n2kLk2\nw2 \u03bbp\u22121\n+\n4D\u03bb\n\u03bb\n+\n2\u03bb\n\u03bb\nif p \u2208 (2, 3),\n2 q\nq p\np\n(\n1\nif p = 3,\ns\u03b1\n\u03bb\u03b1 := kLk\n\u00d7\n\u22121\n\u03c3\nw\nif p \u2208 (2, 3).\n\u03b7i =\n\n(3.12)\n\n(3.13)\n\n(3.14)\n\n(3.15)\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n11\n\nRemark 3.4. The term P(kSk > \u000f) in (3.11) can be bounded in a variety of ways. For instance, using\nChebyshev's inequality and (3.4), one can write\nP(kSk > \u000f) 6\n\nD2 s22\nkSk22\n6\n.\n\u000f2\n\u000f2\n\n(3.16)\n\nAlternatively, one can write\nP(kSk > \u000f) 6\n\nkSkpp\nAX (p)p spp + BX (p)p sp2\n6\n,\n\u000fp\n\u000fp\n\nusing a Rosenthal-type inequality (3.5). An exponential inequality as described in (3.3) can also be used.\nRemark 3.5. The expressions u and v in (3.13) and (3.14) are finite for any given p \u2208 (2, 3] whenever\nsp < \u221e, whereas \u03bb2q may be infinite for p \u2208 (2, 3) even when the condition sp < \u221e holds. It is the additional\ntruncation, with \u2206 instead of \u2206, in the bounds of Section 2 that allows one to use \u03bbp instead of \u03bb2q in the\nterms u and v when p < 3; cf. Remark 2.3.\nThe hardest to obtain result of this section is the nonuniform bound in Theorem 3.6 below.\nTheorem 3.6. Assume that the conditions of Theorem 3.3 are satisfied, and take any real numbers \u03b8, w,\n\u03b40 , \u03c01 , \u03c02 , \u03c03 , and \u03c9 such that the conditions (2.17) hold and\n\u0010 M \u000f2 i\n\u000f\n\u03c9 \u2208 0,\n.\n2\u03c01\nLet\n\u03b7i :=\n\nkLkkXi k\nL(Xi )\nI{2 < p < 3} +\nI{p = 3}.\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n(3.17)\n\n(3.18)\n\nThen for all\none has\n\nwhere\n\nz \u2208 (0, \u03c9/\u03c3]\n\n(3.19)\n\n\u0010 f (S)\n\u0011\n\u0010 L(S)\n\u0011\nP\n>z \u2212P\n> z 6 \u03b3\u0303z + \u03c4\u0303 e\u2212(1\u2212\u03c01 )z/\u03b8 ,\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n(3.20)\n\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c01 \u03c3z\n\u03b3\u0303z := P kSk >\n+ \u03b3z ,\nM\u000f\n\n(3.21)\n\n\u03c4\u0303 := c1 \u03c3p v + c2 u + c3 \u03b4,\n\n(3.22)\n\nand \u03b3z , c1 , c2 , c3 are as in Theorem 2.4.\nRemark 3.7. The restriction (3.19) is of essence. Indeed, if z >> \u03c31 (that is, if z is much greater than \u03c31 ) and\nthe event { L(S)\n\u03c3 > z} in (3.20) occurs, then L(S) >> 1 and hence kSk >> 1, and in this latter zone, of large\ndeviations of S from its zero mean, the linear approximation of f (S) by L(S) will usually break down; cf.\ne.g. (5.18), in which \u03c3\u2206, measuring the difference between \u03c3T = f (S) and \u03c3W = L(S), is on the order of\nmagnitude of kSk2 and thus much greater than L(S) when kSk >> 1. This heuristics will be implicitly used\nin Proposition B.1 in Appendix B, which shows that the upper bound \u03c9\u03c3 on z in (3.19) is indeed the best\npossible up to a constant factor, even when the Banach space X is one-dimensional. Note also that (3.17)\ncan be satisfied for any given \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u221e) by (say) taking \u03c01 to be small enough.\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n12\n\nWhile the expressions for the upper bounds given in Theorems 3.3 and 3.6 are quite explicit, they may\nseem complicated (as compared with the classical uniform and nonuniform BE bounds). However, one should\nrealize that here there are a whole host of players: those associated with the function f and the space X (like\nkLk, M\u000f , \u000f, and D), the parameters we are free to choose (namely, c\u2217 , \u03b8, w, \u03b40 , \u03c01 , \u03c02 , \u03c03 , and \u03c9), and more\ntraditional terms (as sp , \u03c3, and G\u03be ) \u2013 each with a significant and rather circumscribed role to play.\nOne should note that the bounds in Theorems 3.3 and 3.6 do not depend on the dimension of the space\nX but only on the choice of the norm k * k on X. One can exercise this choice to an advantage, as e.g. will\nbe done in the application considered in Section 4.1. The only restriction on the norm is that the space X\n(possibly even infinite-dimensional) be of type 2; in particular, the bounds will depend on the \"smoothness\"\nconstant D for the norm and on the corresponding Rosenthal-type inequality constants (AX (*), BX (*)).\nAnother advantage of the bounds in (3.11) and (3.20) is that they do not explicitly depend on n. Indeed,\nn is irrelevant when the Xi 's are not identically distributed (because one could e.g. introduce any number\nof additional zero summands Xi ). In fact, (3.11)\nP\u221eand (3.20) remain valid when S is the sum of an infinite\nseries of independent zero-mean r.v.'s, i.e. S = i=1 Xi , provided that the series converges in an appropriate\nsense; see e.g. Jain and Marcus [47].\nOn the other hand, for i.i.d. r.v.'s Xi our bounds have the correct order of magnitude in n. Indeed, let\nV, V1 , . . . , Vn be i.i.d. random vectors\nin X, with E V = 0. Here we shall use\n\nn\n\nV :=\nin place of S (and hence\n\n1\nn Vi\n\n1X\nVi\nn i=1\n\nin place of Xi ).\n\nTheorem 3.8. Take any p \u2208 (2, 3]. Suppose that (3.6) holds,\n\u03c3\u0303 := kL(V )k2 > 0,\nand kV kp < \u221e.

Also, (3.23) and (3.25) both hold when\nP( nL(V )/\u03c3\u0303 6 z) replaces \u03a6(z).\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n13\n\nTheorem 3.9. Suppose that a function f : R \u2192 R is twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of\n0, with f (0) = 0 and f 0 (0) 6= 0. Let Y, Y1P\n, Y2 , . . . be a sequence of i.i.d. zero-mean unit-variance real-valued\nn\nr.v.'s with kY k3 < \u221e, and let Y n := n1 i=1 Yi . Then there exists a real number C > 0 such that for all\nn \u2208 N and all z \u2208 R\n\u0010 f (Y )\n\u0011\nC\nn\n\u221a\nP\n6\nz\n\u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 \u221a .\n(3.26)\n0\n|f (0)|/ n\nn\nMoreover, for any \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u221e) there exists a real number C > 0 such that for all n \u2208 N and all z as in (3.24)\n\u0010\nP\n\n\u0011\nf (Y n )\nC\n\u221a\n6\nz\n\u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 3 \u221a .\n0\n|f (0)|/ n\nz n\n\n(3.27)\n\nTheorem 3.9, a straightforward consequence of Theorem 3.8, is stated here to provide an example of\nuniform and nonuniform BE bounds for the \"classical\", \"univariate\" delta method; even this very simple\ncase appears to be new to the literature. Just as with the BE bound for linear statistics,\nwe see that the\n\u221a\nmoment restriction kY k3 < \u221e is sufficient to obtain a bound on the order of O(1/ n). That bounds such\nas (3.26) are useful in applications was suggested to us by E. MolavianJazi [63], who needed such a result in\nhis research in electrical engineering.\nIn applications to problems of the asymptotic relative efficiency of statistical tests, usually it is the closeness\nof the distribution of the test statistic to a normal distribution (in R) that is needed or most convenient; in\nfact, as mentioned before, obtaining uniform bounds on such closeness was our original motivation for this\nwork.\nOn the other hand, there have been a number of deep results on the closeness of the distribution of f (S),\nnot to the standard normal distribution, but to that of f (N ), where N is a normal random vector with the\nmean\u221aand covariance matching those of S. In particular, G\u00f6tze [35] provided an upper bound of the order\nO(1/ n) on the uniform distance between the d.f.'s of the r.v.'s f (S) and f (N ) under comparatively mild\nrestrictions on the smoothness of f ; however, the bound increases to \u221e with the dimension k of the space X\n(which is Rk therein). Bhattacharya and Holmes [10] obtained a constant which is O(k 5/2 ), and Chen and\nFang [12, Theorem 3.5] recently improved this to O(k 1/2 ).\nOne should also note here such results as the ones obtained by G\u00f6tze [34] (uniform bounds) and Zalesski\u0131\u0306\n[116, 117] (nonuniform bounds), also on the closeness of the distribution of f (S) to that of f (N ). There (in\nan i.i.d. case), X can be any type 2 Banach space, but f is required to be at least thrice differentiable, with\ncertain conditions on the derivatives. Moreover, Bentkus and G\u00f6tze [6] provide several examples showing\nthat, in an infinite-dimensional space X, the existence of the first three derivatives (and the associated\nsmoothness conditions on such derivatives) cannot be relaxed in general.\n4. Applications\nHere we shall apply the results of Section 3 to present several novel bounds on the rate of convergence to\nnormality for some commonly used statistics. For the sake of simplicity and brevity, assume throughout this\nsection that\np=3\nand V, V1 , . . . , Vn are i.i.d. X-valued r.v.'s, where X is a Hilbert space; also adopt the notation\n\u03c3\u0303 := kL(V )k2 ,\n\n\u03c2\u03b1 :=\n\nkL(V )k\u03b1\n,\n\u03c3\u0303\n\nand v\u03b1 := kV k\u03b1\n\nfor \u03b1 > 1,\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n14\n\nwhere L is as in (3.6). Under these assumptions we then can choose the smallest (to our knowledge) constants\nfor the Rosenthal-type inequalities in (2.10), (2.11), and (3.5). Namely,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nAR (3), BR (3) = 1, (8/\u03c0)1/6 ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(4.2)\nAR,nc (3), BR,nc (3) = 1.3161/3 , 21/3 ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1/3\nAX (3), BX (3) = 1, 2\n,\naccording to [92, (5)] (set x = 0 there), [90, Corollary 4] and [90, (12)], respectively; cf. also [95].\nEssentially two types of results will be presented in this section. Theorems 4.4, 4.18, 4.24, 4.27, 4.30, 4.31,\ncontaining uniform and nonuniform BE-type bounds for specific statistics (namely, Student's, Pearson's,\nnoncentral Hotelling's, certain statistics used to test hypotheses about a covariance operator, a type of\ncanonical correlation, and maximum likelihood estimators are straightforward applications of Theorem 3.8,\nin each specific instance with its own space X, function f , and random vector V . Of course, these results\ninherit from Theorem 3.8 the not quite explicit constants C, which, recall, were finite expressions depending\nonly upon p, the function f , and the distribution of V , with C in the nonuniform bounds also depending\non \u03c9; however, in contrast with Theorem 3.8, the C's in Theorems 4.4, 4.18, and 4.24 will no longer depend\non the space X, since one can use the same constants D in (3.4) and (AX (*), BX (*)) in (3.5) for all Hilbert\nspaces X.\n\u221a On the other hand, Theorem 4.1 will provide a uniform BE-type bound for a normalized statistic\nnf (V )/\u03c3\u0303, with explicit coefficients on each of the terms in the bound. These coefficients, denoted by\nK with two or three subscripts, will in specific applications be variously bounded from above by finite explicit constants which do not depend on n or z; so, such coefficients may be referred to as pre-constants. The\ncorresponding nonuniform bound is much more complicated and therefore will be relegated to Appendix A,\nwhere it is stated (and proved) as Theorem A.2. To help the reader follow our indexing of the pre-constants,\nlet us say that the subscript of a pre-constant K will be u or e or n, depending on whether the pre-constant\nappears in a uniform BE-type bound or in an exponentially (in z) decreasing term of a nonuniform BEtype bound or in a power-like decreasing term of a nonuniform BE-type bound, respectively; the remaining\nsubscripts refer to the moments of which the pre-constant is a coefficient.\nWe then apply the inequalities of Theorems 4.1 and A.2 to obtain BE-type bounds for the self-normalized\nsum and Pearson's correlation coefficient containing only absolute constants and moments of relevant r.v.'s,\nwith a simple (and optimal) dependence on n and z; these latter bounds are given in Corollaries 4.11, 4.12,\nand 4.22.

One can have a \"nonuniform\" counterpart to Theorem 4.1. Indeed, assume that the conditions\nof Theorem 4.1 take place; in particular, let \u000f and M\u000f be any positive real numbers such that (3.6) holds.\nTake any positive real numbers z0 , \u03b8\u0303, K1 , K2 , and K3 . Then, by Theorem A.2, there exist some finite positive\nconstants \u03c9, Cn1 , Cn21 , Cn22 , Cn31 , Cn32 , Ce0 , Ce1 , Ce2 , and Ce3 , each depending only on \u000f, M\u000f , z0 , \u03b8\u0303, K1 , K2 ,\nand K3 , such that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0010 f (V )\n\u0011\nCn1 \u03c233 + (Cn21 \u2228 Cn22 )v24 \u2228 Cn31 v33 + Cn32 v33\nCe0 + Ce1 \u03c233 + Ce2 v23 + Ce3 v33\n\u221a 6 z \u2212 \u03a6(z) 6\n\u221a\nP\n+\n\u221a\n3\n\u03c3\u0303/ n\nz n\nez/\u03b8\u0303 n\n(4.9)\nfor all z \u2208 R and n \u2208 N such that\nz0 6 z 6\n\n\u03c9\u221a\nn,\n\u03c3\u0303\n\nK1 \u03c233\n\u221a 6 1,\nn\n\nK2 v24\n\u221a 6 1,\n\u03c3\u0303 3 z 3 n\n\nand\n\nK3 v33\n\u221a 6 1.\n\u03c3\u0303 3 z 3 n\n\n(4.10)\n\nThe constants Cn1 , . . . , Ce3 in (4.9) are upper bounds on certain corresponding pre-constants Kn1 , . . . , Ke3 ,\nexplicit expressions for which are given in Theorem A.2. Concerning the conditions in (4.10), note the\nfollowing:\n1. The condition z > z0\u221adoes not diminish generality, in view of uniform bounds (4.4) and (4.5).\n2. The condition z 6 \u03c9\u03c3\u0303 n is essential and even optimal, up to a constant factor, as shown in Appendix B.\n3. The other three conditions in (4.10), involving the constants K1 , K2 , and K3 , will be satisfied when\nn and z are large enough. As mentioned above, the case when z is not large can be covered using a\nuniform bound. Finally, the remaining case with \"large\" z and \"small\" n can be dealt with based on\nan appropriate upper bound on large deviation probabilities. In fact, the proof (given in Appendix C)\nof the nonuniform bound in Corollary 4.12 is conducted right along such lines.\nThe mentioned pre-constants in Theorems 4.1 and A.2 are complicated in appearance. However, in particular applications \u2013 presented in Corollaries 4.11, 4.12, and 4.22 \u2013 these statements will result in bounds\nof much simpler structure, with explicit numerical constants, which are also rather moderate in size, especially in the uniform bounds. The following corollary shows that the asymptotic behavior of the uniform and\nnonuniform BE-type bounds given in Theorems 4.1 and A.2 is quite simple as well, and the corresponding\nconstants are again moderate in size.\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n16\n\nCorollary 4.3.

Thus, for a given (small enough) \u000f, the smoothness condition (3.6) will hold when\nL = f 0 (0)\n\nand M\u000f = sup kf 00 (x)k,\n\n(4.14)\n\nkxk6\u000f\n\nwhere f 0 (x) and f 00 (x) are identified with the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix, respectively, of f at\nsome point x \u2208 X, and then kf 00 (x)k denotes the spectral norm of the matrix f 00 (x). Upon specifying the\nfunction f and the relevant r.v. V , the results of Theorems 4.4, 4.18, and 4.24 (uniform and nonuniform\nbounds without explicit coefficients) will be proved by invoking Theorem 3.8.\n4.1. \"Quadratic\" statistic\nThe first application we consider involves a particularly simple nonlinear statistic investigated by Novak\nin [71, Section 3].

Bentkus,\nJing, Shao, and Zhou [8] recently showed that if kY k4 < \u221e, then (after some standardization) T has a\nlimit distribution which is either the standard normal distribution or the \u03c72 distribution with one degree\nof freedom; the latter will be the case if and only if Y has the two-point distribution described above in\nRemark 4.5 concerning the degeneracy condition \u03c3\u0303 = 0.\nRemark 4.7. The condition kY k4 < \u221e in [8] is equivalent to kV k2 < \u221e, where V is as in (4.19). Therefore,\nit appears\nnatural to require that kV k3 < \u221e or, equivalently, kY k6 < \u221e in order to obtain a bound of order\n\u221a\nO(1/ n); cf. the classical BE bound for linear statistics, where the\u221afiniteness of the third moment of the\nsummand r.v.'s is usually imposed to achieve a bound\n\u221a of order O(1/ n). In fact, the asymptotic expansion\nfor the distribution of T up to the order of O(1/ n) (which follows from the general results for nonlinear\nstatistics obtained by Bhattacharya and Ghosh [11]) indeed contains kY k6 whenever the mean \u03bc is nonzero.\nThe \"central\", or \"null\", case when \u03bc = 0 is in this sense exceptional, as discussed in Remark 4.9. In\nthis case, it is well known that the finiteness of the E |Y |3 is enough for a uniform BE bound for T . On\nthe other hand, it\n\u221a follows from the remark by Novak at the end of [71] that no nonuniform bound of the\nform E |Y |3 g(z)/ n for the self-normalized sum or, equivalently, for the central T can hold for any positive\nfunction g such that g(z) \u2193 0 as z \u2191 \u221e. Also, even for \u03bc = 0, the presence of the higher order moments can\nbe overcome by an appropriate truncation of the underlying distribution, as suggested by [83, Corollary 1.5]\nand the discussion therein following it; further details on this can be found in Remark 4.15 below.\n4.2.1.

It was only in 1996 that Bentkus and\nG\u00f6tze [7, Theorem 1.2] obtained a uniform BE-type bound of the optimal order in n and with the \"correct\"\ndependence on the moments; namely, they showed that there exists an absolute constant A such that\nP(T 6 z) \u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 An E\n\nh\u0010 Y \u00112\nY 3i\n\u221a\n\u2227 \u221a\nn\nn\n\n(4.25)\n\nfor all z \u2208 R; note that the above bound is no greater than A E |Y |p /np/2\u22121 for any p \u2208 [2, 3]. Bentkus,\nBloznelis, and G\u00f6tze [5] provided a similar bound when the Yi 's are not necessarily identically distributed\n(i.d.). Shao [105, Theorem 1.1] obtained a version of (4.25) with explicit absolute constants (and also without\nthe i.d. assumption), which in particular implies that in the i.i.d. case for all z \u2208 R\n\u221a\n\u221a\n25 E|Y |3 I{|Y | 6 n/2}\n2\n\u221a\nP(T1 6 z) \u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 10.2n E Y I{|Y | > n/2} +\n(4.26)\nn\n25kY k3\n6 \u221a 3.\n(4.27)\nn\nNovak [70, 71] obtained BE-type bounds for T1 ; however, the structure of those bounds is rather complicated.\nNagaev [66, Theorem 1 and (1.18)], stated that for all z \u2208 R\nP(T1 6 z) \u2212 \u03a6(z) 6\n\n36kY k33 + 9 4.4kY k33 + kY k44 /kY k33 + kY 2 \u2212 1k33\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2227\nn\nn\n\n(4.28)\n\nwhen the Yi 's are i.i.d.

For instance, a specific choice of the parameters yields (A3 , A4 , A6 ) = (1.53, 1.52, 1.28).\nThus, all the constant factors A3 , A4 , A6 in (4.29) can be made rather small. A bound for the general, non-i.d.\ncase, similar to (4.29) but with slightly greater constants, was also obtained in [83]; as shown there, that\nbound in [83] compares well with (4.26), especially after truncation.\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n21\n\nA number of important advances concerning limit theorems for the central T and/or T1 have been made\nrather recently. For instance, Hall [36] obtained an Edgeworth expansion of the distribution of T . It was\nonly in 1997 that Gin\u00e9, G\u00f6tze, and Mason [31] found a necessary and sufficient condition for the Student\nstatistic to be asymptotically standard normal. Shao [103, 104], Nagaev [67], Jing, Shao, and Wang [49], and\nWang and Hall [113] studied the probabilities of large deviations. Chistyakov and G\u00f6tze [15, 16] and Jing,\nShao, and Zhou [50] considered the probabilities of moderate deviations. See Gin\u00e9 and Mason [32] and Pang,\nZhang, and Wang [74] concerning the law of the iterated logarithm, and Wang and Jing [114] and Robinson\nand Wang [100] for exponential nonuniform BE bounds. This is of course but a sampling of the recent work\ndone concerning asymptotic properties of the central T and the related self-normalized sums; for work done\nsomewhat earlier, the reader may be referred to the bibliography in [7].\nRemark 4.9. The central T (as compared with the noncentral one) is special for two reasons: (i) when \u03bc = 0,\nthen L(V ) = Y and, to be finite, \u03c3\u0303 needs only the second\u221amoment of Y (rather than the fourth) to exist;\nand (ii) while in general \u2206 is\u221a\nrather naturally of the order nkV k2 , \u2206 is significantly smaller for the central\n\u221a\nT . Moreover, the first term, nL(V )/\u03c3\u0303, in a formal stochastic expansion of the central T is precisely nY\nand thus linear in the Yi 's, whereas for the noncentral T this term contains Y 2 . This heuristics is reflected\nin Corollary 4.10 below, which is derived using Theorem 2.1, with a better choice of \u2206 for this specific case\nthan that for the general results of Section 3.\nCorollary 4.10 (to Theorem 2.1).

Therefore, by Remark 4.8, the bound in (4.30) may also in certain cases compare\nwell with that in (4.26); see Remarks 4.14 and 4.15 for some details.\nThe uniform and nonuniform bounds presented in Corollaries 4.11 and 4.12, respectively, involve the sixth\nmoments of Y , as they are \u221a\nbased on the general results of Theorems 4.1 and A.2, with \u2206 being on the order\nof magnitude of kSk2 /\u03c3 = nkV k2 .\nCorollary 4.11 (to Theorem 4.1).

One may also\nnote that the constants \u00c23 , \u00c24 , and \u00c26 in the case when wg = 0 are significantly greater than those for\n1\nis much smaller than z13 for very large z > 0, the maximum\nwg = 1. This reflects the fact that, whereas ez/2\n1\n1\nof the ratio ez/2 / z3 over all z > 0 is (attained at z = 6 and) quite large, about 10.75. Whereas at least\nsome of the constants \u00c23 , \u00c24 , and \u00c26 are rather large when wg = 0, one can put this into a perspective by\nrecalling that, even in the much simpler case of sums of independent identically distributed r.v.'s, the first\nexplicit constant in the nonuniform BE bound (obtained in [73]) was greater than 1955.\nSimilarly to their counterparts in [83], the proofs of Corollaries 4.11 and 4.12 demonstrate a method\nby which one may obtain a variety of specific numerical constants for the bounds of the form (4.32) and\n(4.36). In particular, the introduction of the numerous parameters in Theorems 4.1 and A.2 allows one to\naccount more accurately for the relations between the possible sizes of the various moments (cf. e.g. the ideas\nrepresented by [79, Theorems 5.2, 6.1, 6.2]). On the other hand, such an approach rather understandably\nresults in significantly more complicated expressions.\nRemark 4.13. Suppose here that, in addition to the other condition of Corollary 4.11, the r.v. Y is symmetric.\nThen, by Remark A.3, Table 1 can be replaced by Table 2, with somewhat better constants. The proof of\nthis remark is contained in the proof of Corollary 4.12.\nRemark 4.14. The uniform bounds in (4.30) and (4.32) (as well as the nonuniform one in (4.36)) involve\nmoments of orders higher than 3, in contrast with the uniform bound in (4.27), say. However, it appears\nthat the effect of the smaller constants in (4.30)\u2013(4.31) and (4.32)\u2013(4.33) will oftentimes more than counterbalance the \"defect\" of the higher-order moments. For instance, suppose that Y \u223c t\u0303d , where t\u0303d denotes the\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\nwg = 1\nwg = 0\n\n\u00c23\n35\n37\n124\n145\n\n\u03c9 = 0.1\n\u00c24\n32\n19\n123\n73\n\n\u00c26\n31\n5\n121\n22\n\n\u00c23\n48\n57\n141\n205\n\n\u03c9 = 0.5\n\u00c24\n48\n29\n138\n103\n\n23\n\n\u00c26\n41\n12\n138\n42\n\nTable 2\nConstants associated with nonuniform bound in (4.36) when Y is symmetric.\n\nstandardized t distribution with d degrees of freedom, where d is any positive real number. This distribution\nis symmetric. Its tails vary from very heavy ones for small d to the very light tails of the standard normal\ndistribution, corresponding to the limit case d = \u221e. The absolute moments, say ms (d), of order s of the\ndistribution t\u0303d will be infinite for all s \u2208 [d, \u221e). Then, in particular, the bound in (4.27) will be infinite if\nd 6 3. On the other hand, one can show that\n\u0001 for Y \u223c t\u0303d the bound in (4.30) say with the choice of the triple\n(A3 , A4 , A0 ) = (3.48, 1.27, \u22121.43) in (4.31) will be smaller than that in (4.27) for all real d > 4.15; this can\nclearly decreases in\nbe checked using monotonicity properties of m3 (d) and m4 (d). Namely, m4 (d) = 3(d\u22122)\nd\u22124\n\u221a 1\np\u03c0\nx+\nd\u22123\n2 \u0393(x)\nd > 4. As for m3 (d), one can write\n8 m3 (d) = r( 2 ) for d > 3, where r(x) := \u0393(x+ 1 ) . So, reasoning\n2\n\u00010\nR 1 td\u22123\n1\nas in the proof of [84, Lemma 2.1], one has (ln m3 (d) d (d \u2212 3) = \u2212 0 (t+1)\ndt\n\u2212\n2\n2(d\u22122) < 0 for all d > 3,\nwhence m3 (d) decreases in d > 3. Note also here that the bound in (4.27) will be nontrivial (that is, less\nthan 1) for some d \u2208 (0, 4.15) only if n > 252 kY k63 = 252 m3 (d) > 252 m3 (4.15) > \u00014439.\nSimilarly, the bound in (4.30) again with (A3 , A4 , A0 ) = (3.48, 1.27, \u22121.43) will be smaller than that\nin (4.27)pwhen\u0001 Y has any standardized\ntwo-point distribution which is not too skewed \u2013 it is enough that\np\n\u0001\nP Y = q/p = p, P Y = \u2212 p/q = q, 0 < p < 1, q := 1\u2212p, and p\u2227q > 0.0035; moreover, if p\u2227q < 0.0035\n\u221a \u00012\nthen the bound in (4.27) will be nontrivial only if n > 252 kY k63 = 252 \u221a1pq \u2212 2 pq > 176707. Note that\nany zero-mean distribution is a mixture of zero-mean two-point distributions [82], so that such distributions\nappear to be of particular interest.\nRemark 4.15. As was mentioned in Remark 4.7, the potential \"defect\" caused\n\u0001 by using higher order moments\nin our bounds for the central Student statistic such as (4.30) and (4.32) can be eliminated or, at least,\nfurther reduced by an appropriate truncation, as suggested by [83, Corollary 1.5] and the discussion following\nit. Such a truncation may be referred to as \"postfactum truncation\" \u2013 since it is done to the moments in\nthe resulting bounds, rather than in the proof of the bounds (which latter is the kind of technique usually\nemployed to get rid of higher order moments). Looking at the comparisons made in [83] and below in the\npresent remark, it appears that the postfactum truncation may generally be more effective than the in-theproof truncation; one possible reason for this advantage of the postfactum truncation is that it is sensitive to\nthe underlying distribution of the observations, which seems to make sense, as knowledge of this distribution\nis needed anyway in order to compute the bounds.\nYet another way to further improve the bounds in Corollaries 4.10 and 4.11 is to note the following. The\nlast step in the proof of these bounds is the use of Young's inequality, in order to eliminate products of\ndifferent moments, and so, this step entails some loss in the accuracy. More accurate (and complicated in\nappearance) bounds on |P(T1 6 z) \u2212 \u03a6(z)| are given by (5.44) (from which (4.36) is derived) and (4.4) (with\n\u03c3\u0303 = 1, \u03c23 = kY k3 , v2 = kY k24 , v3 = kY 4 \u2212 Y 2 + 1k3/2 , and M\u000f as defined in (C.1)).\nLet us make a few graphical comparisons of the bounds (5.44) and (4.4) to either of the bounds in\n(4.26) or (4.29) (using the triple (A3 , A4 , A6 ) = (2, 1, 0.19), as found in the table at the end of the proof\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n24\n\nBounds\n5\n\nBounds\n10\n8\n\n4\n\n6\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\nd\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nd\n5\n\n20\n\n(a) n = 10\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(b) n = 100\n\nBounds\n2.0\n\nBounds\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n1.0\n0.4\n0.5\n\n0.2\nd\n5\n\n10\n(c) n = 1000\n\n15\n\n20\n\nd\n5\n\n10\n(d) n = 10, 000\n\nFig 2: Comparison of bounds (4.29) (red), (5.44) (green), (4.4) (blue), and (4.26) (purple) when Y has the\nStudent distribution with d degrees of freedom \u2013 using the postfactum truncation (solid) or not using it\n(dotted).\n\nof Corollary 4.12). Here let us consider the case when the distribution of Y has the Student distribution\nwith d degrees of freedom or the centered Pareto distribution with shape parameter s; the latter distribution\ns \u2212(s+1)\n1\nhas the density function x 7\u2192 s(x + s\u22121\n)\nI{x > \u2212 s\u22121\n} for s > 1. Plots of any of these four bounds\n(represented by the dotted curves) are found in Figures 2 and 3 for n \u2208 {10, 100, 1000, 10000} and d \u2208 [2, 20]\n(or s \u2208 [2, 20]). The solid lines in Figures 2 and 3 represent these four bounds after a (numerically optimized)\npostfactum truncation is performed. The bounds in (5.44) and (4.4) have also been numerically minimized\nin c\u2217 and \u000f. The remarks made in [83] are also applicable here. Particularly, the effect of truncation in\ndecreasing any of the bounds is most significant when the tails of the distribution are heavy (i.e. d or s is\nsmall). A general pattern to be found is that, when n is large enough for the (truncated or non-truncated)\nbounds to be smaller than the trivial bound 1, the smallest bound is that of (4.29), followed by (5.44), then\n(4.4), with the bound in (4.26) typically being the largest of the bounds under consideration. Again, we have\nthe somewhat surprising result that the bounds presented in this paper, developed for a very general class\nof nonlinear statistics of which the self-normalized sum is but a single example, compare quite competitively\nwith other bounds in the literature that were proven using methods tailored for the self-normalized sum.\nRemark 4.16.

Choose now \u03b8 = kY k44 \u2212 1 (assuming that kY k4 6= 1\nand hence kY k4 >p1; the case kY k4 = 1 can then be treated by continuity, say). Then, by (4.12), y\u2217 =\n((2/\u03c0)1/6 + kY k3 ) kY k44 \u2212 1. Using this expression for y\u2217 , one \u0001can show that the bound in (4.11) will\nbe smaller than that in (4.37) and even smaller than 6.4kY k33 whenever kY k4 6 2.189kY k3 . In view\nof [84, Corollary 1.3 (ii)], this will be the case when Y has the standardized t distribution with d degrees of\nfreedom, for any real d > 6. The same conclusion about the bounds in (4.11) and (4.37) will be true\np when\n\u0001 Y\nhas any standardized two-point distribution which is not too skewed \u2013 it is enough that P Y = q/p = p,\np\n\u0001\nP Y = \u2212 p/q = q, 0 < p < 1, q := 1 \u2212 p, and p \u2227 q > 8.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 . Note also that in the case of the statistic\nT1 one can get an asymptotic bound better than the one just obtained based on Corollary 4.3 (which latter\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n26\n\nis derived from Theorem 3.3, which in turn is a corollary to Theorem 2.1) \u2013 if instead one uses Theorem 2.1\ndirectly; cf. Corollary 4.10 (to Theorem 2.1) vs. Corollary 4.11 (to Theorem 4.1).\nIn a paper preceding [71], Novak [70, page 424] obtained a bound\nwhich, taken together with (2.29), implies that\nq\n(4.38)\ndT1 ,asymp 6 Cnov,3 kY k33 + Cnov,4 kY k44 \u2212 1,\n\nratio\n3\n\n2 1/4\nwhere Cnov,3 := 0.4748 + e\u221a82\u03c0 = 1.648 . . . and Cnov,4 := ( e\u03c0\n)\n=\n0.695 . . . . In the picture on the left, one can see the graphs of the\nratio of these two bounds for E Y 4 = 1+, 24 , 44 , and 104 as functions\n1\nof \u03b1 := (kY k3 \u2212 1)/(kY k4 \u2212 1) \u2208 (0, 1). The limit of this ratio is\napproximately 0.8944 when E Y 4 approaches 1 from above. Thus,\n\u03b1\nthe bound in (4.11) for T1 is usually moderately greater than the\n0\n1\nRatio of bound in (4.11) to (4.38), bound in (4.38). On the other hand, in contrast with the general\nkY k3 \u22121\nwhere \u03b1 := kY\nand kY k4 = 1+ methods used in the present paper, the methods used in [70] were\nk4 \u22121\n(long-dash), 2 (medium-dash), 4 (short- specialized to target certain ratio-type statistics. Also, the nonasymptotic bounds in [70, (5.6) and (5.7) ] on which the asymptotic\ndash), and 10 (dotted)\nbound in (4.38) is based, were of a very complicated structure, with\nfurther work needed to bound the various terms and choose explicit\nvalues of the parameters.\nRemark 4.17. Consider now the asymptotic behavior of the nonuniform bound for T1 . Novak [70, Theorem 10]\nprovides an explicit, though complicated in appearance, nonuniform BE-type bound for this statistic. Using\n[70, (5.10)] and (2.29) (and still assuming that E Y = 0 and E Y 2 = 1, as well as E Y 4 < \u221e) one can show\nthat\n\u221a\n(4.39)\nlim sup\nsup\nz 3 n P(T1 6 z) \u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 30.2211kY k33 ;\n\n2\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\ng(n)6z6n1/6\n\nhere g stands for any positive increasing unbounded function on N. Thus, for the specific statistic T1 , the\nasymptotic bound in (4.39) coincides with that in (4.13), obtained for general nonlinear statistics of the\nform f (V ). Note also that the bound in (4.13) holds for z in the zone [g(n), n1/2 /g(n)], which is much wider\nthan the zone [g(n), n1/6 ] in (4.39) if g is taken to grow slowly enough. On the other hand, Theorem 4.1 and\nthen Corollary 4.3 contain the moment condition v3 < \u221e, which is equivalent, in the specific case of T1 , to\nE Y 6 < \u221e, which is more stringent than the corresponding condition E Y 4 < \u221e used here to derive (4.39).\n4.3. Pearson's R\nLet (Y, Z), (Y1 , Z1 ), . . . , (Yn , Zn ) be a sequence of i.i.d. random points in R2 , with\nVar Y \u2208 (0, \u221e)\n\nand\n\nVar Z \u2208 (0, \u221e).\n\nRecall the definition of Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient:\nPn\nYZ \u2212Y Z\ni=1 (Yi \u2212 Y )(Zi \u2212 Z)\nqP\nq\nR := qP\n=q\n,\nn\nn\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(Y\n\u2212\nY\n)\n(Z\n\u2212\nZ)\ni\ni\nY \u2212Y\nZ \u2212Z\ni=1\ni=1\n\n(4.40)\n\nwhere\nY :=\n\n1\nn\n\nP\n\ni\n\nYi ,\n\nZ :=\n\n1\nn\n\nP\n\ni\n\nZi ,\n\nY 2 :=\n\n1\nn\n\nP\n\ni\n\nYi2 ,\n\nZ 2 :=\n\n1\nn\n\nP\n\ni\n\nZi2 ,\n\nand Y Z :=\n\n1\nn\n\nP\n\ni\n\nYi Zi ;\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n27\n\nlet R := 0 if the denominator in (4.40) is 0. Note that R is invariant under all affine transformations of the\nform Yi 7\u2192 a + bYi and Zi 7\u2192 c + dZi with positive b and d; so, in what follows we may (and shall) assume\nthat the r.v.'s Y and Z are standardized:\nEY = EZ = 0\n\nand\n\nE Y 2 = E Z 2 = 1,\n\nand we let \u03c1 := E Y Z = Corr(Y, Z).\n\nLet X = R5 , and for x = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) \u2208 X such that (1 + x3 \u2212 x21 )(1 + x4 \u2212 x22 ) > 0, let\nf (x) = f (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) = p\n\nx5 + \u03c1 \u2212 x1 x2\np\n\u2212 \u03c1;\n1 + x3 \u2212 x21 1 + x4 \u2212 x22\n\n(4.41)\n\nlet f (x) := \u2212\u03c1 for all other x \u2208 X. Recall \u221a\n(4.18) to see that f 00 (x) exists and is continuous on the closed\n\u000f-ball about the origin for any fixed \u000f \u2208 (0, 3/2); then the smoothness condition (3.6) holds,\nwith L(x) =\n\u0001\nf 0 (0)(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) = \u2212\u03c1x3 /2 \u2212 \u03c1x4 /2 + x5 . Letting V = Y, Z, Y 2 \u2212 1, Z 2 \u2212 1, Y Z \u2212 \u03c1 , so that L(V ) =\n\u0001\nY Z \u2212 \u03c12 Y 2 + Z 2 , we see that f (V ) = R \u2212 \u03c1. Then Theorem 3.8 immediately yields\nTheorem 4.18. Take any \u03c9 > 0 and assume that \u03c3\u0303 > 0 and v3 < \u221e. Then for all z \u2208 R and n \u2208 N\nP\n\n\u0010R \u2212 \u03c1\n\u0011\nC\n\u221a 6 z \u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 \u221a ,\n\u03c3\u0303/ n\nn\n\n(4.42)\n\nwhere C is a finite expression depending only on the distribution of the random point (Y, Z); also, for all real\nz > 0 and n \u2208 N satisfying (3.24)\n\u0010R \u2212 \u03c1\n\u0011\nC\n\u221a 6 z \u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 3 \u221a ,\nP\n\u03c3\u0303/ n\nz n\n\n(4.43)\n\nwhere C is a finite expression depending only on \u03c9 and the distribution of (Y, Z).\nRemark 4.19. Note that the degeneracy condition \u03c3\u0303 = 0 is equivalent to the following: there exists some\n\u03ba \u2208 R such that the random point (Y, Z) lies a.s. on the union of the two straight lines through the origin\nwith slopes \u03ba and 1/\u03ba (for \u03ba = 0, these two lines should be understood as the two coordinate axes in the\nplane R2 ). Indeed, if \u03c3\u0303 = 0, then Y Z \u2212 \u03c12 (Y 2 + Z 2 ) = 0 a.s.; solving this equation for the slope Z/Y ,\none obtains two roots, whose product is 1. Vice versa, if (Y, Z) lies a.s. on the union of the two lines\nthrough the origin with slopes \u03ba and 1/\u03ba, then Y Z = 2r (Y 2 + Z 2 ) a.s. for r := 2\u03ba/(\u03ba2 + 1) and, moreover,\nr = E 2r (Y 2 + Z 2 ) = E Y Z = \u03c1.\nFor example, let the random point (Y, Z) equal (cx, \u03bacx), (\u2212cx,\nr\u2212\u03bacx), (\u03bacy, cy), (\u2212\u03bacy, \u2212cy) with probx\u22122 + y \u22122\ny2\nabilities p2 , p2 , 2q , 2q , respectively, where x 6= 0, y 6= 0, \u03ba \u2208 R, c :=\n,\np\n:=\n, and q := 1 \u2212 p;\n\u03ba2 + 1\nx2 + y 2\nthen \u03c3\u0303 = 0 (and the r.v.'s Y and Z are standardized). In particular, one can take here x = y = 1, so that\np = q = 21 .\n\u221a\nRemark 4.20. In order to get a uniform bound of order O(1/ n) in Theorem 4.18, it is necessary to assume\nthat v3 < \u221e, which is equivalent to kY k6 + kZk6 < \u221e. This moment condition might seem overly restrictive,\nsince only third absolute moments are required to obtain a BE-type bound of the same order for linear\nstatistics (or even for the central Student statistic). However, the moments kY k6 and kZk6 do appear in an\nasymptotic expansion (up to an order n\u22121/2 ) of the distribution of R when \u03c1 6= 0; cf. Remark 4.7; for details,\none can see [78]. When \u03c1 = 0, the most restrictive moment assumption for the existence of the asymptotic\nexpansion is that kY Zk3 < \u221e.\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n28\n\nRemark 4.21. Recall the asymptotic distribution results of Bhattacharya and Ghosh [11] as outlined in\nRemark 4.6. In the conditions of Theorem 4.18, take now the very simple case when Y and Z are zero-mean,\nunit-variance, absolutely continuous r.v.'s independent of each other. Then a straightforward calculation\nshows that a1 = 0, a3 = 0, and hence \u2206(z) = \u2212 61 E Y 3 E Z 3 (z 2 \u2212 1)\u03c6(z). So, the bound in (4.42) has an\noptimal dependence on n whenever E Y 3 6= 0 and E Z 3 6= 0. Moreover, since \u2206(z) is real-analytic in z, L, H,\nand moments of V , we see that generally \u2206(z) 6= 0 and hence the bound in (4.42) is generally of the optimal\norder in n.\nThe bounds in (4.42) and (4.43) appear to be new. In fact, we have not been able to find in the literature\nany uniform (or nonuniform) bound on the closeness of the distribution of R to normality. Note that such\nbounds are important in considerations of the asymptotic relative efficiency of statistical tests; see e.g.\nNoether [69]. Shen [106] recently provided results concerning probabilities of large deviations for R in the\nspecial case when (Y, Z) is a bivariate normal r.v. Formal asymptotic expansions for the density of R follow\nfrom the paper by Kollo and Ruul [55].\nWe next state one particular simplification of the uniform bound in (4.4) when applied to the Pearson\nstatistic in the case when \u03c1 = 0.\nCorollary 4.22 (to Theorem 4.1). Assume that E Y Z = 0 and \u03c3\u0303 = kY Zk2 > 0.

The specific pairs listed in (4.45) are obtained by trying to minimize\nB0 \u2228 B3 /\u03c3\u0303 3 for \u03c3\u0303 \u2208 {1, 2, 1/2, 3, 1/3}.\nRemark 4.23. Bounds similar to the ones in Corollary 4.22 can be obtained, e.g., for other statistics related\nto Pearson's R, including the Fisher z transform. However, for reasons discussed in Appendix D and because\nthe paper is already quite long, we chose not to present such results here.\n4.4.

Let us recall a couple of other useful facts (found in, say,\nthe monograph [43]): the spectral norm kBk of any k \u00d7 k matrix B does not exceed kBkF , and kBk < 1\nimplies I \u2212 B is nonsingular and k(I \u2212 B)\u22121 k 6 1/(1 \u2212 kBk).

Using again the asymptotic expansion results of Bhattacharya and Ghosh [11, Theorem 2] (cf.\nRemark 4.21), we can show that generally the upper bound in (4.48) has an optimal dependence on n as\nwell. For instance, consider the simple case when Y = (Y1 , Y2 ), where Y1 and Y2 have absolutely continuous\ndistributions and are independent of one another; further suppose that E Y2 = 0, E Y1 = \u03bc1 6= 0, and that\nY1 is symmetric, so that E(Y1 \u2212 \u03bc1 )m = 0 for odd natural m. Then, for \u2206(z) as in (4.23),\n\u2206(1) = \u2212\n\n\u03bc21 (\u03bd4 + 1) + 2\n\u03c6(1)\n\u03c3\u0303\n\nand \u03c3\u0303 = |\u03bc1 |\n\nq\n\n(\u03bd4 \u2212 1)\u03bc21 + 4,\n\nwith \u03bd4 := E(Y1 \u2212 \u03bc1 )4 > E2 (Y1 \u2212 \u03bc1 )2 = 1. So, \u03c3\u0303 > 0 and \u2206(1) 6= 0. Thus, the dependence of the upper\nbound in (4.48) on n is optimal.\nAgain, the bounds in (4.48) and (4.49) appear to be new; we have found no mention of BE bounds for T 2\nin the literature. Probabilities of moderate and large deviations for the central Hotelling T 2 statistic (when\n\u03bc = 0) were considered by Dembo and Shao [21]. Asymptotic expansions for the generalized T 2 distribution\nfor normal populations were given by It\u00f4 [45] (for \u03bc = 0), and by It\u00f4 [46], Siotani [108], and Muirhead [64]\n(for any \u03bc); Kano [53] and Fujikoshi [26] give an asymptotic expansion for the distribution of the central T 2\nfor non-normal populations, and Kakizawa and Iwashita [52] do this for the noncentral T 2 statistic.\n4.5.

Hence f := g \u25e6 h satisfies (3.6), for both versions of the function g, and so, Theorem 3.8 may be\napplied to f (V ) = \u039b1 \u2212 (\u03b2/\u03b1)k and f (V ) = \u039b2 \u2212 (\u03b2/e\u03b1 )k .\nFor the case when the dimension k is large, Nagao [68] proposes the test statistics\nU :=\n\n\u00112 o\n1 n\u0010 S\ntr\n\u2212I\nk\ntr(S)/k\n\n1 \b\nand Ve := tr (S \u2212 I)2\nk\n\nin place of the statistics \u039b1 and \u039b2 , respectively.

Ledoit and Wolf [60]\ninvestigate the asymptotic behavior of both U and Ve when k/n \u2192 c \u2208 (0, \u221e) as n \u2192 \u221e, as opposed to the\n\"fixed-dimensional\" case (where n \u2192 \u221e while k is assumed a constant). They show that the test of H0,1\nbased on U remains consistent in the large-dimensional setting, whereas the test of H0,2 based on Ve is not\nnecessarily consistent.

The non-degeneracy condition \u03c3\u0303 > 0 immediately implies that Theorem 4.27 \u2013 and the delta\nmethod itself \u2013 are applicable only to non-null distributions of the statistics \u039b1 , \u039b2 , U , and Ve , since Lg = 0\nfor any of these statistics under the assumption of their respective null hypotheses. This should hardly be\nsurprising, as it is known that these statistics (or some normalizing function of them) all have a limiting \u03c72\ndistribution under the null hypothesis. However, one can fix the null-degeneracy of the statistics \u039b1 , \u039b2 , U ,\nor Ve and thus make the delta method and our BE bounds applicable even to the null distributions by using\nessentially the same trick as in the definition of the statistic W in (4.51), that is, by adding a term of the\n\b\n\u0001\n2\nform \u03b1 tr(S)\n\u2212 1 for some nonzero real \u03b1.\nk\nBy diagonalization of \u03a3, we can simply characterize the degeneracy condition \u03c3\u0303 = 0 for any of the above\nstatistics in this subsection. Indeed, by the spectral decomposition, \u03a3 = QT DQ, where D is the diagonal\nmatrix with the eigenvalues \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbk of \u03a3 on its diagonal and Q is an orthogonal matrix whose columns\nare corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors of \u03a3. Let Z = (Z1 , . . . , Zk )T := QY . Then, for the statistic \u039b1 ,\n\u0001\n\u03b1 k\nL(V\n\u03b2\n\n\b\n\b\n) = tr (\u03a3\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 I)(Y Y T \u2212 \u03a3) = tr QT (D\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 I)QQT (Z Z T \u2212 D)Q\n\b\n\b\n\b\n= tr (D\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 I)(Z Z T \u2212 D) = tr (D\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 I)Z Z T \u2212 tr I \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 D\nk\n\u0001 2\nP\n1\n1\n=\n\u03bbj \u2212 \u03b1 Zj .\nj=1\n\nSince \u03c3\u0303 = 0 means precisely that L(V ) = 0 a.s., it follows that for any non-null alternative, \u03c3\u0303 = 0 for the\nstatistic \u039b1 if and only if the support of the distribution of the random vector Y degenerates so as to lie\nentirely on a certain quadric conical surface in Rk . Similar work shows that for one of the statistics \u039b2 , U ,\nVe , and W we have \u03c3\u0303 = 0 if and only if the respective one of the random (homogeneous or not) quadratic\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n33\n\nforms\nk\nP\nj=1\n\n1\n\u03bbj\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 1 Zj2 ,\n\nk\nP\n\n(\u03bbj \u2212 \u03b1)(k\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bbj )(Zj2 \u2212 \u03bbj ),\n\nj=1\nk\nP\n\n(\u03bbj \u2212 1)(Zj2 \u2212 \u03bbj ),\n\nj=1\n\nk\nP\nj=1\n\n\u03bbj \u2212 1 \u2212\n\nk\u03b1\nn\n\n\u0001\n\n(Zj2 \u2212 \u03bbj )\n\nequals 0 a.s. In particular, whenever the random vector Y is absolutely continuous, one has \u03c3\u0303 > 0 for all\nthese statistics in the non-null case, and then \u03c3\u0303 > 0 for the statistic W even in the null case provided that\n(1 \u2212 nk )\u03a3 6= I.\nRemark 4.29. Let \u03a30 be any given positive definite symmetric matrix. Then the hypotheses \u03a3 = \u03c3 2 \u03a30\n(with an unknown \u03c3 2 > 0) and \u03a3 = \u03a30 on the common covariance matrix \u03a3 of i.i.d. random vectors Yi are\nobviously equivalent to the respective hypotheses \u03a3\u0303 = \u03c3 2 I (with an unknown \u03c3 2 > 0) and \u03a3\u0303 = I on the\n\u22121/2\ncommon covariance matrix \u03a3\u0303 of the i.i.d. random vectors \u1ef8i := \u03a30 Yi . So, the results in this subsection\ncan be obviously extended to the more general case of the null hypotheses \u03a3 = \u03c3 2 \u03a30 and \u03a3 = \u03a30 .\nIt appears certain that the bounds in Theorem 4.27 are all new to the literature; indeed, any of the results\nconcerning these statistics that we have found investigates their asymptotic properties under the assumption\nof a normal population, whereas our bounds have only mild moment restrictions on Y . We mention here\nthat Theorem 3.8 could be applied to several other popular statistics which are smooth functions of the\nsample covariance matrix S. For instance, our results can easily yield BE bounds for statistics proposed by\nSrivastava [111] or Fisher et al. [25]; Chen et al. [14] propose a statistic for the sphericity test which is a\nfunction of a U -statistic, for which the methods of this paper and [13] could presumably be adapted. The\nreader is referred to [65] for other statistics used in testing for the equality of population covariances or\nindependence between certain projections applied to Y .\n4.6. Principal component analysis (PCA)\nIt is well known that any simple eigenvalue of a (say, symmetric real matrix) and the orthoprojector onto\nthe corresponding eigenspace are smooth functions of the matrix. Therefore, the delta method is almost\nuniversally applicable to PCA, and hence so are our results such as Theorem 3.8. The actual verification of\nthe smoothness condition (3.6) in PCA may involve operator perturbation theory and related tools, based\non a representation of analytic functions of a linear operator as certain integrals of the resolvent. This\nrepresentation largely reduces the problem of the smoothness of a general analytic function of an operator\nto the obvious smoothness of the map A 7\u2192 A\u22121 on the set of all bounded invertible linear operators A\n(cf. (F.5) and (F.6)). Whereas this idea is rather transparent, its execution may in some cases be rather\nnontrivial, and it may result in complicated expressions for \u000f and M\u000f in (3.6).\nAs an illustration of these general theses, let us consider here a statistic rather recently introduced by\nCupidon et al. [17, 18]. Let Y, Y1 , . . . , Yn be iid r.v.'s taking values in a separable real Hilbert space H with\ninner product h*, *i and the corresponding norm k * k. Assume at this point that E kY k2 < \u221e, E Y = 0, and\nthe covariance operator\nR := Cov Y = E(Y \u2297 Y )\nof Y is (strictly) positive definite. Here, as usual, \u2297 denotes the tensor product on H, so that Rx = Ehx, Y iY\nfor all x \u2208 H. Given the condition E kY k2 < \u221e, the covariance operator R is known to be compact, which\nallows its spectral decomposition \u2013 see e.g. [54, Theorem 2.10, page 260]; a short proof of the compactness\nof R is presented in Appendix E for the readers' convenience.\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n34\n\nNext suppose that H = H1 \u2295 H2 , where H1 , H2 are closed orthogonal subspaces of H; for j, k \u2208 {1, 2}, let\n\u03a0j denote the orthoprojector onto Hj , Rjk := \u03a0j R\u03a0k , and also let Ij denote the identity operator on Hj .\nThen, for any fixed \u03b1 > 0, the regularized squared principal canonical correlation, RSPCC or \u03c12 , is defined\nby the formula\nhx, R12 yi2\n;\n(4.54)\n\u03c12 := \u03c12 (\u03b1) := max\nx\u2208H1 \\{0} hx, (\u03b1I1 + R11 )xihy, (\u03b1I2 + R22 )yi\ny\u2208H2 \\{0}\n\nthat this is a well-defined quantity is proved in [18]. Define the sample RSPCC, \u03c1\u03022 , by replacing Rjk in (4.54)\nwith Sjk , where\nP\nP\nSjk = \u03a0j S \u03a0k , S := Y \u2297 Y \u2212 Y \u2297 Y , Y := n1 i Yi , and Y \u2297 Y := n1 i Yi \u2297 Yi ;\nthus, S is the sample covariance operator of the random vector Y . See e.g. [23, 38] for discussion and results\non the use of canonical correlations in functional data.\nNext define the (bounded self-adjoint nonnegative-definite linear) operators\nR1 :=(\u03b1I1 + R11 )\u22121/2 R12 (\u03b1I2 + R22 )\u22121 R21 (\u03b1I1 + R11 )\u22121/2 ,\nR2 :=(\u03b1I2 + R22 )\u22121/2 R21 (\u03b1I1 + R11 )\u22121 R12 (\u03b1I2 + R22 )\u22121/2 ,\n\n(4.55)\n\nand similarly let R\u0302j denote the sample analogues of Rj (obtained by replacing Rjk with Sjk ); under the\nassumption that E kY k2 < \u221e (which implies that R is compact), we see that R1 and R2 are also compact.\nMoreover, by [17, Theorem 2.4], kR1 k = kR2 k = \u03c12 and kR\u03021 k = kR\u03022 k = \u03c1\u03022 , where \u03c12 is as in (4.54) and k * k\ndenotes the operator norm, so that kRj k is the largest eigenvalue of Rj .\nFix any j \u2208 {1, 2} and assume that \u03c12 is a simple nonzero eigenvalue of Rj , and then let P denote the\northoprojector onto the corresponding (one-dimensional) eigenspace of Rj . Let B(H) and B(Hj ) denote the\nHilbert spaces of all bounded linear operators on H and Hj , respectively, equipped with the corresponding\noperator norms.\nLet g(x) := kx + Rj k \u2212 kRj k for any x \u2208 B(Hj ), so that g(R\u0302j \u2212 Rj ) = \u03c1\u03022 \u2212 \u03c12 . By formulas (3.6)\u2013(3.8) on\npage 89, (2.32) on page 79, and (3.4) on page 88 in [54] (with n = 1, \u03ba = 1, \u03bb\u0302(\u03ba) = kx + R\u0302j k, \u03bb = kRj k = \u03c12 ,\n\u03bb\u0302(1) = tr(xP ), T (1) = x, T (2) = T (3) = * * * = 0, a = kxk, c = 0, and 00 := 1), the smoothness condition (3.8)\n%m2\nwill be satisfied with \u000fg = \u03b2/m, \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1), L(x) = \u03bb\u0302(1) = tr(xP ), and Mg = 2 1\u2212\u03b2\n, where % := maxz\u2208\u0393 |z \u2212 \u03bb|,\nm := maxz\u2208\u0393 kRj (z)k, Rj (z) := (Rj \u2212 zI)\u22121 is the resolvent of Rj , and \u0393 is the boundary of any open disc\nD in C such that \u03bb \u2208 D but the closure of D does not contain 0 or any eigenvalue of Rj other than \u03bb.\nThe results from [54] referred to in the above paragraph were stated there for the case when the Hilbert\nspace H is finite-dimensional. All those results carry verbatim to the \"infinite-dimensional\" case. Such\ninformation can be extracted from other chapters in [54]. However, for readers' convenience, in\u0001 Appendix F\nwe provide the few necessary stepping stones to make the transition to the infinite dimension.\nBy [30, Theorem 2.1], condition (3.7) holds for the function y 7\u2192 hj (y) := (\u03b1Ij + Rjj + y)\u22121/2\n\u2212 (\u03b1Ij + Rjj )\u22121/2 in place of h for some real \u000fhj > 0 and all y \u2208 Hj with kyk 6 \u000fhj . So, in view of definitions\n(4.55) of Rj , their counterparts for R\u0302j , and Remark 3.2, one can set up a function h : H \u00d7 B(H) \u2192 Hj\nin a straightforward manner so that condition (3.7) holds and h(V ) = R\u0302j \u2212 Rj , with the zero-mean vector V = (Y, Y \u2297 Y \u2212 R). Using Remark 3.2 once again, one sees that the function f = g \u25e6 h satisfies the\nsmoothness condition (3.6), and at that f (V ) = \u03c1\u03022 \u2212 \u03c12 . Thus, Theorem 3.8 yields\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n35\n\nTheorem 4.30. Assume that \u03c3\u0303 > 0 and v3 < \u221e, for \u03c3\u0303 and vp defined in (4.1).

We see the recurring theme that kY k4 < \u221e\nis used to establish asymptotic normality of \u03c1\u03022 (cf. [18, (2.1), Theorem 4.2]), while the moment restriction\nkY k6 < \u221e \u221a\n(equivalent to v3 < \u221e in Theorem 4.30) is needed here to bound the rate of convergence on the\norder O(1/ n). Again, it appears that the bounds in Theorem 4.30 are entirely new to the literature.\nIn Subsection 4.5, we considered various smooth functions of the determinant and trace of the sample\ncovariance matrix for finite-dimensional r.v.'s Y , and in the present subsection we have a function of the\nlargest eigenvalue of some smooth function of a sample covariance operator. Other statistics which are\nfunctions of eigenvalues from a sample covariance operator (be it constructed from a finite-dimensional or\ninfinite-dimensional population) may of course lie in the class of statistics to which Theorem 3.8 could be\napplied; the primary problem to the practitioner is the demonstration of the smoothness condtion (3.6). The\nuse of perturbation theory, as was done above, appears to be valuable for many such potential applications;\nwe mention here statistics proposed in [27,48], concerning the testing of equality of two covariance operators,\nas further examples. Yet another potential application of our results would be to the empirical Wasserstein\ndistance, for which central limit theorems were recently given in [99]; cf. [22, 33, 72] (as noted by Dudley in\nhis review MR0752258 on MathSciNet, the normality assumption is not actually needed there).\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n36\n\n4.7. Maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs)\nBounds on the closeness of the distribution of the MLE to normality in the so-called bounded Wasserstein\ndistance, dbW , were recently obtained in [2] under certain regularity conditions. In [1], these bounds were\nimproved in the rather common case when the MLE \u03b8\u0302 satisfies the condition\nq(\u03b8\u0302) =\n\nn\n1 X\ng(Yi ),\nn i=1\n\n(4.58)\n\nwhere q : \u0398 \u2192 R is a twice continuously differentiable one-to-one mapping, g : R \u2192 R is a Borel-measurable\nfunction, and the Yi 's are i.i.d. real-valued r.v.'s.\np\nIt is noted in [2, Proposition 2.1] that for any r.v. Y and Z \u223c N (0, 1) one has dKo (Y, Z) 6 2 dbW (Y, Z),\nwhere dKo denotes the Kolmogorov distance. This bound on dKo in terms of dbW is the best possible one, up\na constant factor. Indeed, for each real \u03b5 > 0, define a r.v. Y\u03b5 as follows: Y\u03b5 = \u03b5 if 0 < Z < \u03b5 and Y\u03b5 = Z\notherwise.\nThen for any Lip(1) function h : R \u2192 R one has | E h(Y\u03b5 )\u2212E h(Z)| 6 E |h(Y\u03b5 )\u2212h(Z)| 6 E |Y\u03b5 \u2212Z| =\nR\u03b5\n(\u03b5\n\u2212\nz)\u03c6(z)\ndz 6 \u03c6(0)\u03b52 /2. So, dbW (Y\u03b5 , Z) 6 dW (Y\u03b5 , Z) 6 \u03c6(0)\u03b52 /2, where dW is the Wasserstein distance:\n0\ndW (X, Y ) := sup{| E h(X) \u2212 E h(Y )| : h \u2208 Lip(1), h bounded} for any r.v.'s X p\nand Y . On thepother hand,\ndKo (Y\u03b5 , Z) > P(Z < \u03b5) \u2212 P(Y\u03b5 < \u03b5) = \u03a6(\u03b5) \u2212 1/2 \u223c \u03c6(0)\u03b5, so that dKo (Y\u03b5 , Z) > 2\u03c6(0) \u2212 o(1) dbW (Y\u03b5 , Z)\nas \u03b5 \u2193 0.\n\u221a\nTherefore, even though the bounds on dbW obtained in [1, 2] are of the optimal order O(1/ n), the\nresulting bounds on the Kolmogorov distance are only of the order O(1/n1/4 ).\nIn \u221a\nthis subsection, as an application of our general results, we shall obtain bounds of the optimal order\nO(1/ n) on the closeness of the distribution of the MLE to normality in the Kolmogorov distance assuming\na somewhat relaxed version of the condition (4.58). In addition, we shall present a corresponding nonuniform\nbound. At that, our regularity conditions appear simpler than those in [1, 2].\nIndeed, let here Y, Y1 , Y2 , . . . be r.v.'s mapping a measurable space (\u03a9, A) to another measurable space\n(X , B) and let (P\u03b8 )\u03b8\u2208\u0398 be a parametric family of probability measures on (\u03a9, A) such that the r.v.'s Y1 , Y2 , . . .\nare i.i.d. with respect to each of the probability measures P\u03b8 with \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398; here the parameter space \u0398 is\nassumed to be a subset of R. As usual, let E\u03b8 denote the expectation with respect to the probability measure\nP\u03b8 . Suppose that for each \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398 the distribution P\u03b8 Y \u22121 of the r.v. Y with respect to the probability\nmeasure P\u03b8 has a density p\u03b8 with respect to a measure\n\u03bc on B. For each point x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 X n such\nQn\nthat the likelihood function \u0398 3 \u03b8 7\u2192 Lx (\u03b8) := i=1 p\u03b8 (xi ) has a unique maximizer, denote this maximizer\nby \u03b8\u0302n (x); otherwise, assign to \u03b8\u0302n (x) any value in \u0398. Let us then refer to \u03b8\u0302n (Y ) as the MLE of \u03b8, where\nY := (Y1 , Y2 , . . . ). Clearly, this is a more general definition of the MLE than usual, and we can even allow\nthe function \u03b8\u0302n to be non-measurable. So, the MLE \u03b8\u0302n (Y ) does not have to be a r.v. Let \u03b80 \u2208 \u0398 be the\n\"true\" value of the unknown parameter \u03b8, such that \u03980 := (\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5, \u03b80 + \u03b5) \u2286 \u0398 for some real \u03b5 > 0.\nWe assume the following relaxed version of the condition (4.58): for some real constant C > 0 and each\nnatural n there exists a set En \u2208 B \u2297n such that\n\u221a\nP\u03b80 (Y \u2208\n/ En ) 6 C/ n\n(4.59)\nand for each point x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 En the value \u03b8\u0302n (x) of the MLE belongs to the neighborhood \u03980 of\nthe point \u03b80 and satisfies the condition\nn\n\u0001\n1 X\nq \u03b8\u0302n (x) =\ng(xi ),\nn i=1\n\n(4.60)\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n37\n\nfor some measurable function g : X \u2192 R and some twice continuously differentiable mapping q : \u03980 \u2192 R\nwith q 0 (\u03b8) 6= 0 for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u03980 , so that the mapping q is one-to-one. Suppose also that the MLE \u03b8\u0302n (Y ) is\nconsistent at the point \u03b80 , that is, \u03b8\u0302n (Y ) \u2212\u2192 \u03b80 in probability with respect to the probability measure\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nP\u03b80 ; since the MLE \u03b8\u0302n (Y ) does not have to be a r.v., the precise meaning of this consistency is that\n(P\u03b80 )\u2217 (|\u03b8\u0302n (Y ) \u2212 \u03b80 | > \u03b4) \u2212\u2192 0 for each real \u03b4 > 0, where (P\u03b80 )\u2217 denotes the outer measure induced by\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nthe probability measure P\u03b80 . Then, under the condition E\u03b80 |g(Y1 )| < \u221e, it follows from (4.60) by the law of\nlarge numbers that q(\u03b80 ) = \u03bcg := E\u03b80 g(Y1 ) or, equivalently, \u03b80 = q \u22121 (\u03bcg ), where q \u22121 stands for the inverse\nof the function q.\np\nAssuming further that \u03c3g := Var\u03b80 g(Y1 ) \u2208 (0, \u221e), let us introduce\nVi :=\n\ng(Yi ) \u2212 \u03bcg\n\u03c3g\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , n and\nf (v) := q \u22121 (\u03bcg + \u03c3g v) \u2212 q \u22121 (\u03bcg ) = q \u22121 (\u03bcg + \u03c3g v) \u2212 \u03b80\nfor real v such that \u03bcg + \u03c3g v \u2208 q(\u03980 ) and f (v) = 0 (say) for the other real values of v. Then, in view of\n(4.60), on the \u0001event {Y \u2208\n/ En } one has f (V n ) = \u03b8\u0302n (Y ) \u2212 \u03b80 , and at that f (0) = 0, f 0 (0) = \u03c3g (q \u22121 )0 (\u03bcg ) =\n0 \u22121\n0\n\u03c3g /q q (\u03bcg ) = \u03c3g /q (\u03b80 ), and f is twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of 0. So, Theorem 3.9 immediately yields\nTheorem 4.31. In addition to the conditions specified above, assume that E\u03b80 |g(Y1 )|3 < \u221e. Then for all\nn \u2208 N and z \u2208 R\n\u0010 \u03b8\u0302 (Y ) \u2212 \u03b8\nz \u0011\nC +C\nn\n\u221a 0 6 0\nP\u03b80\n(4.61)\n\u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 \u221a ,\n|q (\u03b80 )|\n\u03c3g / n\nn\nwhere C is as in (4.59) and C is a finite expression depending\nonly on the P\u03b8 -distributions of Y1 for \u03b8 in a\n\u221a\nneighborhood of \u03b80 . Also, if in (4.59) one can replace n by n2 , then for any \u03c9 > 0 and for all real z > 0\nand n \u2208 N satisfying (3.24),\nP\u03b80\n\n\u0010 \u03b8\u0302 (Y ) \u2212 \u03b8\nz \u0011\nC +C\nn\n\u221a 0 6 0\n\u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 3 \u221a ,\n|q (\u03b80 )|\n\u03c3g / n\nz n\n\n(4.62)\n\nwhere C is a finite expression depending only on \u03c9 and the P\u03b8 -distributions of Y1 for \u03b8 in a neighborhood of\n\u03b80 .\nAs was noted, the MLE \u03b8\u0302n (Y ) does not have to be a r.v., and so, the P\u03b80 -probability in (4.61) and\n(4.62) does not have to be defined. Thus, strictly speaking, one should understand this probability as the\ncorresponding outer or inner probability, (P\u03b80 )\u2217 or (P\u03b80 )\u2217 \u2013 each one of the two versions will do in each of\nthe two inequalities, (4.61) and (4.62).\nLet us show that, under certain mild and natural conditions, (4.60) is fulfilled if the densities p\u03b8 form an\nexponential family with a natural parameter (cf. [1]), so that\np\u03b8 (x) = e\u03b8g(x)\u2212c(\u03b8)\n\n(4.63)\n\nfor some function c : \u0398 \u2192 R and all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398 and x \u2208 X . Here, as before,Rg : X \u2192 R is a measurable function. The\nnatural choice of the parameter space here is \u0398 := {\u03b8 \u2208 R : E(\u03b8) := X e\u03b8g(x) \u03bc(dx) < \u221e}, and then of course\nc(\u03b8) = ln E(\u03b8) for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398. As before, assume that \u03980 := (\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5, \u03b80 + \u03b5) \u2286 \u0398 for some real \u03b5 > 0. In fact,\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n38\n\nby decreasing \u03b5 if necessary, we may and shall assume that [\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5, \u03b80 + \u03b5] \u2286 \u0398. If \u03bc({x \u2208 X : g(x) 6= a}) = 0\nfor some real a, then for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398 one has E(\u03b8) = e\u03b8a \u03bc(X ) < \u221e, whence p\u03b8 (x) = 1/\u03bc(X ) for x \u2208 X , so\nthat the densities p\u03b8 are the same for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398, and therefore parameter \u03b8 is not identifiable. Let us exclude\nthis trivial case. Note that the function c is infinitely many times differentiable (and even real-analytic) on\n\u03980 = (\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5, \u03b80 + \u03b5). Moreover, its derivative c0 is (strictly) increasing and hence c is strictly convex on \u03980 ,\nbecause c00 (\u03b8) = (ln E)00 (\u03b8) = Var\u03b8 g(Y1 ) > 0 for \u03b8 \u2208 \u03980 , since the trivial case\np of the non-identifiability of \u03b8\nhas just been excluded. In particular, it follows that the condition \u03c3g := Var\u03b80 g(Y1 ) \u2208 (0, \u221e) holds. At\nthat, \u03bcg := E\u03b80 g(Y1 ) = c0 (\u03b80 ).\nLet now\nn\nn\n\u0001o\n1 X\nEn := x \u2208 X n : c0 (\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5) <\n(4.64)\ng(xi ) < c0 (\u03b80 + \u03b5) .\nn i=1\nBy Markov's inequality,\nn\nn\n\u0011\n\u0010\nn\no\n\u0011\n\u00101 X\nX\n\b\ng(Yi ) 6 c0 (\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5) = P\u03b80 exp \u2212 \u03b5\ng(Yi ) > exp \u2212 n\u03b5 c0 (\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5)\nP \u03b80\nn i=1\ni=1\nn\nn\no\nX\n\b\n6 exp n\u03b5 c0 (\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5) E\u03b80 exp \u2212 \u03b5\ng(Yi )\ni=1\n\n\b\n= exp n\u03b5 c0 (\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5) + nc(\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5) \u2212 nc(\u03b80 ) = e\u2212n\u03b4(\u03b5) ,\nwhere \u03b4(\u03b5) := c(\u03b80 ) \u2212 c(\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5) \u2212 c0 (\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b5 > 0; the latter inequality holds because (i) the function c is\nstrictly convex and (ii) one has h(u + v) > h(u) +Ph0 (u)v for any strictly\u0001 convex differentiable function h,\nn\n0\n\u2212n\u03b4(\u2212\u03b5)\nany u, and any nonzero v. Quite similarly, P\u03b80 n1\n, with \u03b4(\u2212\u03b5) > 0. So,\ni=1 g(Yi ) > c (\u03b80 + \u03b5) 6 e\nP\u03b80 (Y \u2208\n/ En ) 6 e\u2212n\u03b4(\u03b5) + e\u2212n\u03b4(\u2212\u03b5) ,\n(4.65)\n\u221a\nso that condition (4.59) holds, even with n2 in place of n. On the other hand, in view of (4.64) and because\nc0 is continuous and increasing on \u03980 , we see that (4.60) holds for all x \u2208 En , with q(\u03b8) = c0 (\u03b8) for all\n\u03b8 \u2208 \u03980 . Now the consistency of the MLE at point \u03b80 follows because (i) by (4.65), P\u03b80 (Y \u2208\n/ En ) \u2212\u2192 0 and\nn\u2192\u221e\nP\nn\n0\n(ii) by the law of large numbers, n1\ni=1 g(Yi ) \u2212\u2192 E\u03b80 g(Y1 ) = \u03bcg = c (\u03b80 ) in P\u03b80 -probability.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nNote finally that the condition E\u03b80 |g(Y1 )|3 < \u221e in Theorem 4.31 holds as well, since E\u03b80 exp{\u03b5 |g(Y1 )|} <\nE\u03b80 exp{\u03b5 g(Y1 )} + E\u03b80 exp{\u2212\u03b5 g(Y1 )} = c(\u03b80 + \u03b5) + c(\u03b80 \u2212 \u03b5) < \u221e.\nWe have verified all the conditions needed in order to apply Theorem 4.31. In addition to this, note that\n\u22022\nin the present context of exponential families, q 0 (\u03b8) = c00 (\u03b8) = \u2212 \u2202\u03b8\n2 ln p\u03b8 (x) does not depend on x, whence\n\u22022\nfor each \u03b8 \u2208 \u03980 one has q 0 (\u03b8) = \u2212 E\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\nln\np\n(Y\n)\n=\nI(\u03b8),\nthe\nFisher\ninformation contained in Y1 .

Suppose that the conditions introduced above starting with the exponential family condition\n(4.63) hold. Then for all n \u2208 N and z \u2208 R\n\u0010\n\u0011\nz\nC\nP\u03b80 \u03b8\u0302n (Y ) \u2212 \u03b80 6 p\n\u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 \u221a ,\n(4.66)\nn\nnI(\u03b80 )\nwhere C is a finite expression depending only on the P\u03b8 -distributions of Y1 for \u03b8 in a neighborhood of \u03b80 .\nAlso, for any \u03c9 > 0 and for all real z > 0 and n \u2208 N satisfying (3.24),\n\u0010\n\u0011\nC\nz\nP\u03b80 \u03b8\u0302n (Y ) \u2212 \u03b80 6 p\n\u2212 \u03a6(z) 6 3 \u221a ,\n(4.67)\nz n\nnI(\u03b80 )\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n39\n\nwhere C is a finite expression depending only on \u03c9 and the P\u03b8 -distributions of Y1 for \u03b8 in a neighborhood of\n\u03b80 .\nExample 4.33. Let here X = R and let B be the Borel \u03c3-algebra over R. Let the measure \u03bc on B be\ndefined by the formula \u03bc(dx) = (x + 1)\u22123 I{x > 0} dx, and let g(x) = x for all real\nR \u221e x. Let then p\u000e\u03b8\nbe as in (4.63), with \u0398 = (\u2212\u221e, 0]. It follows that c0 increases on \u0398, with c0 (0\u2212) = 0 x(x + 1)\u22123 dx\nR\u221e\n(x + 1)\u22123 dx = 1 < \u221e. On the other hand, for each natural n, with nonzero P\u03b8 -probability for each\n0\nPn\nPn\n1\n\u03b8 \u2208 \u0398, the r.v. n1\ni=1 g(Yi ) = n\ni=1 Yi may take arbitrarily large values, in particular values exceeding\n1 = c0 (0\u2212) = sup\u03b8\u2208\u0398 c0 (\u03b8). So, the equality (4.58) will be violated with nonzero P\u03b8 -probability for each \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398\nand for each natural n. However, Theorem 4.31 and Corollary 4.32 will hold in this situation. This shows\nthe usefulness of the relaxed version (4.59)\u2013(4.60) of the condition (4.58).\nAs shown in [94], with more effort one can utilize the \"multivariate\" Theorem 3.8 (rather\n\u221a than the\n\"univariate\" Theorem 3.9, used in this subsection) to obtain bounds of optimal order O(1/ n) on the\nKolmogorov distance for MLEs in general, without assuming (4.58) or (4.59)\u2013(4.60). It is also shown in [94]\nthat, again without assuming (4.58) or (4.59)\u2013(4.60), one can obtain the corresponding nonuniform bounds\nof the optimal orders in n and z. All these results can be extended to the more general case of M -estimators\nor, even more generally, to the estimators that are zeros of estimating functions; see e.g. [39]. Indeed, the\ncondition that p\u03b8 is a pdf for \u03b8 6= \u03b80 is used in our proofs only in order to state that E\u03b8 `0X (\u03b8) = 0 and\nE\u03b8 `0X (\u03b8)2 = \u2212 E\u03b8 `00X (\u03b8) = I(\u03b8) \u2208 (0, \u221e). In the case of M -estimators or zeros of estimating functions, the\ncorresponding conditions will have to be just assumed, with some other expressions in place of the Fisher\ninformation\nI(\u03b8), as it is done e.g. in [76, 77], where uniform (but not nonuniform) bounds of optimal order\n\u221a\nO(1/ n) for M -estimators were obtained (via different, specialized methods): in [76] for a one-dimensional\nparameter space \u0398 and in [77] in the multidimensional case.\n5.

That all the pre-constants in Theorem A.2 are finite is easily verifiable by inspection, except\nperhaps for the pre-constants Kn1 , Kn22 , and Kn31 , whose expressions in (A.15), (A.17), and (A.18) involve\ncomparatively complicated suprema. However, Lemma C.1 in Appendix C provides the sufficient conditions\n\u03ba3 > 32 and \u03ba\u03022 > 2 in (A.7) for these three suprema, and hence for the pre-constants Kn1 , Kn22 , and Kn31 , to\nbe finite.\nOne can substantially improve the bound on \u03b3\u0303z in (5.27). The following lemma is key to that, and its\nproof will be given after the proof of Theorem A.2.\nLemma A.5. Assume that the conditions of Theorem A.2 hold.

There are a\nfew remarks to be made concerning the verification that the values listed in those tables indeed prove the\nstatement of Corollary 4.12. First, it is a practical necessity to use a sufficiently powerful CAS; we performed\nthe calculations with the Mathematica software. In order to skirt any issue of rounding error in intermediate\ncalculations, the values in Tables 3 and 4 should be interpreted as being exact rational numbers; in this way,\n\u00c2j (and the expressions upon which the \u00c2j 's depend) can be calculated to within any prescribed precision.\nSome care must be taken in order to implement the expressions for the \u00c2j 's. Note that \u03bd3 in (C.4) (used\nin the definition of \u03bdj,k in (C.9)) and M\u000f in (C.1) are algebraic expressions and therefore can be calculated\nexactly in a CAS. Concerning the numbers Aj,1 in (C.12), the triples (A3 , A4 , A6 ) are obtained by similar\ncalculations (with exact rational numbers) as directed by the proof of [83, Theorem 1.2]; one should also\nreplace the absolute constant 0.4785 in the proof there (due to Tyurin [112]) with the smaller constant\n0.4748 (due to Shevtsova [107]). For each of the two pairs (w4 , w6 ) \u2208 {(1, 1), (0.5, 0.2)} considered here, the\nparameters used to obtain the triples (A3 , A4 , A6 ) are listed below (using the notation of [83]):\nw4\n1\n0.5\n\nw6\n1\n0.2\n\nA3\n1.5175\n1.9946\n\nA4\n1.4852\n0.9996\n\nA6\n1.4814\n0.1897\n\n\u03b1\n0.080\n0.216\n\n\u03b52\n0.206\n0.369\n\n\u03b53\n3.187\n0.761\n\n\u03b54\n0.135\n0.278\n\n\u03b83\n0.415\n0.408\n\n\u03b84\n2.898\n3.532\n\n\u03ba\n0.173\n0.275\n\nAlso note that (A.15)\u2013(A.18), (C.16), and (C.19) contain expressions of the general form supx>x0 k(x) or\nsup0<x6x0 k(x) for some function k and positive number x0 . For the specific values of the parameters listed\nin Tables 3 and 4, one can use Lemma C.1 below to see that these suprema are all attained at the boundary\npoint x0 . Finally, bounding \u00e31 in (A.11) involves estimating the root of the equation in [85, (2.3)]; as noted at\nthe end of the paragraph containing formula (2.16), LW ; c,\u03c3 is nonincreasing in \u03c3 > 0, and hence any upper\nbound on the mentioned root results in an upper bound on \u00e31 . Implementation of the expressions \u00c2j in\naccordance with the above remarks and the parameter values listed in Tables 3 and 4 will then demonstrate\nthat (4.36) holds.\nTo prove that the statement of Corollary 4.12 holds when Y is assumed to be symmetric and Table 2 is\nused in place of Table 1, one need only amend the definitions of c\u03032 and Kn1 as prescribed by Remark A.3,\nand then use the parameter values given below in Tables 5 and 6.\nLemma C.1.

An advantage to using Rz (as opposed to R) in making statistical inferences\nabout \u03c1 follows from its variance-stabilizing property in normal populations; that is, n Var(Rz ) \u2192 1 for\nall \u03c1 \u2208 (\u22121, 1) as n \u2192 \u221e, as opposed to n Var(R) \u2192 (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )2 , whenever (Y, Z) has a bivariate normal\ndistribution. Moreover, the distribution of Rz converges to normality more rapidly than does the distribution\nof R (especially for non-zero values of \u03c1) when the pair (Y, Z) comes from a normal population; see e.g.\nFisher [24], David [19], and Hotelling [44]. In his discussion of Hotelling's paper, Kendall provides heuristics\nsuggesting that such variance stabilization of the distribution of a statistic may often result in it being\ncloser to normality. Namely, if an approximate constancy of the variance of a statistic were the same as an\napproximate constancy of its distribution itself, and if the distribution is close to normality at least for one\nvalue of the parameter (say, \u03c1, as in the present case), then it would be close to normality for all values of \u03c1.\nHowever, it is well known that the closeness of the distribution of a statistic to normality is usually\nmainly determined, not by the variance, but by the third moments of the underlying distribution. It is\ntherefore natural to wonder whether or to what extent the nice properties of the z transform hold for nonnormal populations. For moderate sample sizes n, Gayen [29] observed that the convergence to normality\nfor both R and Rz is lessened for non-normal populations with \u03c1 6= 0, and Monte Carlo sampling performed\nby Berry and Mielke [9] suggests that the presence of skewness or heavy tails in the population of (Y, Z)\nsignificantly reduces\nto Rz when \u03c1 6= 0. In [78], explicit expressions\n\u221a\n\u221a the accuracy of a normal approximation\nfor \u2206R = limn\u2192\u221e n|FR \u2212 \u03a6|K and \u2206Rz = limn\u2192\u221e n|FRz \u2212 \u03a6|K are derived, where FR and FRz are the\nd.f.'s of R and Rz and |*|K denotes the Kolmogorov distance. These \"asymptotic distances\" generally depend\non up to the sixth moments of Y and Z when \u03c1 6= 0, and it is demonstrated in [78] that, if the distribution\nof (Y, Z) is not bivariate normal, \u2206Rz can be just as easily greater than \u2206R as less.\nIn light of the above considerations, we now briefly investigate how any of the BE-type bounds of Section 3,\nwhen applied to the statistic Rz , would fare in a comparison with corresponding bounds associated with R.\nAside from the choice of parameter values, the only differences between the applications of our bounds to R\nand Rz are those arising from the choice of f ; namely, upon letting g(x) := tanh\u22121 (f (x) + \u03c1) \u2212 tanh\u22121 \u03c1 for\nall x with f as in (4.41), one has g(V ) = Rz \u2212 tanh\u22121 \u03c1. In the case when \u03c1 = 0, we see that f 0 (0) = g 0 (0)\nand g\u221a00 (0) = f 00 (0); moreover, in view of results in [11], one can see that an asymptotic expansion up to\nO(1/ n) of the d.f. of R is identical to that of Rz , whether or not the population of (Y, Z) is Gaussian.\nDespite these similarities between R and Rz , it appears that Mg := supkxk6\u000f kg 00 (x)k > Mf :=\nsupkxk6\u000f kf 00 (x)k for \u000f > 0, at least when \u03c1 = 0. In particular, we showed (in the proof of Corollary 4.22)\n3\nthat Mf 6 1.962 when \u000f = 10\n; on the other hand, one can see that\n\u0001\n3\n28269\n28269\n45081\n45081\n183801\nkg 00 (x)k > 2.104 and kxk < 10\nwhen x = \u2212 200000\n, 200000\n, 500000\n, 500000\n, 1000000\n,\nso that Mg > 2.104 > 1.962 > Mf , which will result, at least using the method presented in this paper,\nin a worse BE-type bound for Rz as compared with that for R. In view of these points, one can conclude\nthat, at least for \u03c1 = 0, the use of Fisher's z transform Rz in place of Pearson's R will hardly yield better\nBE-bounds.\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n73\n\nAppendix E: Compactness of the covariance operator\nHere we give a short proof that the covariance operator of a r.v. with finite second moment is compact.

Let B(H) denote the Banach space of\nall bounded linear operators A : H \u2192 H.\nOne can now define the resolvent R : res R \u2192 B(H) by the formula\nR(z) := (R \u2212 zI)\u22121 =\n\nX\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\n1\nP\u03bb ;\n\u03bb\u2212z\n\n(F.4)\n\nP\nthe latter equality can be easily verified in view of (F.1), (F.3), and (F.2), because R \u2212 zI = \u03bb\u2208\u039b (\u03bb \u2212 z) P\u03bb .\nTake now any nonzero \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, which is necessarily an isolated point of the set \u039b. So, there is an open\ndisc D\u03bb in C such that \u03bb \u2208 D\u03bb but no other point of the set \u039b \u222a {0} is in the closure of D\u03bb . Let \u0393\u03bb be the\nboundary of D\u03bb . Then, by (F.4) and the Cauchy integral theorem,\nZ\n1\nP\u03bb = \u2212\nR(z) dz,\n(F.5)\n2\u03c0i \u0393\u03bb\nwhence\n\u03bb=\n\n1\n1\n1\ntr P\u03bb =\ntr RP\u03bb = \u2212\nn\u03bb\nn\u03bb\n2\u03c0in\u03bb\n\nZ\ntr RR(z) dz.\n\u0393\u03bb\n\nFormulas (F.5) and (F.6) are important, because it is comparatively easy to analyze the resolvent.\n\n(F.6)\n\n\fIosif Pinelis and Raymond Molzon/Convergence rate in delta method\n\n75\n\nAcknowlegment.
