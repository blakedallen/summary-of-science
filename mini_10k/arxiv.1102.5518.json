We study\nmaximal factorizations in depth when S has embedding dimension less\nthan four, and establish formulas for dmax (S) in this case.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet N denote the nonnegative integers. A numerical semigroup S is a subsemigroup of N that contains 0 and has a finite complement in N. For two elements\nu and u\u2032 in S, u \u0016 u\u2032 if there exists an s \u2208 S such that u + s = u\u2032 . This\ndefines a partial ordering on S. The minimal elements in S \\ {0} with respect\nto this ordering form the unique minimal set of generators of S, which is denoted P\nby {a1 , a2 , . . . , at } where a1 < a2 < * * * < at . The numerical semigroup\nt\nS = { i=1 ci ai | ci \u2265 0} is represented using the notation S = ha1 , ..., at i. Since\nthe minimal generators of S are distinct modulo a1 , the set of minimal generators is finite. Furthermore, S having finite complement in N is equivalent to\ngcd (a1 , a2 , . . . , at ) = 1. The cardinality, t, of the set of minimal generators of\na semigroup S is called the embedding dimension of S. The element a1 is called\nthe multiplicity of S. When S 6= N, we have 2 \u2264 t \u2264 a1 .\nBy definition, if s \u2208 S, then there exists a t-tuple of nonnegative integers\n(c1 , c2 , . . . , ct ) such that s = c1 a1 + c2 a2 + * * * + ct at . We call (c1 , c2 , . . . , ct )\na factorization of s. For two factorizations (c1 , c2 , . . . , ct ) and (d1 , d2 , . . . , dt )\nof s, we say they are different if ci 6= di for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t. The length of a\nfactorization (c1 , c2 , . . . , ct ) is defined as c1 +c2 +* * *+ct . The set of factorizations\nof s, denoted by F (s), is precisely the set of nonnegative integer solutions of the\nequation x1 a1 + x2 a2 + * * * + xt at = s and is therefore finite.\nA basic arithmetic constant that measures the behavior of factorizations in a\nnumerical semigroup is the cardinality of F (s), which is called the denumerant\nof s in S. See [13] for an exhaustive view of results related to the denumerant. Recently, there has been interest in the factorization theory of numerical\n1\n\n\fsemigroups and the insight it provides into the general theory of commutative\nmonoids; for example, see [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10]. Here we consider a variation of\nthe denumerant.\nDefinition 1.1. The maximal denumerant of s in S is the number of factorizations of s that have maximal length and is denoted by dmax (s; S).\nCertainly, the maximal denumerant of s in S is less than or equal to its denumerant in S, and thus also finite. On the other hand, unlike the denumerant,\nas we vary over the elements in S, the maximal denumerant is always bounded.\nThis is not difficult to see and will be proven in Theorem 2.3. Thus, we have\nthe well-defined quantity given in the next definition.\nDefinition 1.2. The maximal denumerant of S is\ndmax (S) = max{dmax (s; S)}.\ns\u2208S\n\nWe will focus on computing dmax (S) when S can be generated by three\nelements; in particular, when S has embedding dimension three. When S is\n(perhaps non-minimally) generated by a1 , a2 , and a3 , by letting g = gcd(a2 \u2212\na1 , a3 \u2212 a1 ), m = (a2 \u2212 a1 )/g, and n = (a3 \u2212 a1 )/g, we can write\nS = ha1 , a1 + gm, a1 + gni,\nwhich leads to unexpectedly nice formulas. Theorems 3.5 and 3.6 will be proven\nin Section 3.\nTheorem 3.5. Let 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < mn such that \u03b1 \u2261 \u2212a1 mod mn. We have the\nfollowing formula:\n\uf8f1 l a1 m\n\uf8f4\n,\nif \u03b1 \u2208 hm, ni\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 mn\ndmax (S) =\nl\nm\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 a1 + 1, otherwise.\nmn\nTheorem 3.6. If x and y are integers such that mx + ny = a1 , then we have\nthe following formula:\nlxm l y m\ndmax (S) =\n+\n.\nn\nm\nThe motivation for such a variation of the denumerant is the consideration of length-preserving restrictions. For example, perhaps we are interested in factorizations of an element that have either maximal or minimal\nlength. This might happen when working with the numerical semigroup ring\nR = k[[ta1 , ta2 , . . . , tad ]], where k is a field and m = (ta1 , ta2 , . . . , tad )R is the\nunique maximal ideal. In this case, the maximal length of the factorizations\nof s \u2208 S is the m-adic order of ts \u2208 R, i.e., the largest power of m that contains ts , see [5]. Another instance occurs in money-changing problems where\n2\n\n\fthe minimal length of the factorizations of s \u2208 S is the fewest number of coins\nneeded to make change for s using the denominations a1 , a2 , . . . , at , see [6]. Of\ncourse, the overarching concern is changing from one factorization to another\nin a numerical semigroup. The minimal presentation of a numerical semigroup\n(see [12]) is helpful when studying all factorizations; however, we note that it is\nnot as useful for our current endeavor because these \"basic trades\" do not generally preserve length. With the appropriate modifications, an approach via a\nminimal presentation may be fruitful and we leave this as an avenue for further\nresearch.\nIn the next section, we show that the maximal denumerant is always finite,\nand that for semigroups with embedding dimension less than three, dmax (S) =\n1. In Section 3, we focus on numerical semigroups with embedding dimension\nexactly equal to three. In the last section, we demonstrate the utility of our\nresults by explicitly computing the maximal denumerant of semigroups with\nmultiplicity 7 and embedding dimension 3.\n\n2\n\nThe Finiteness of dmax(S)\n\nFor a given numerical semigroup S = ha1 , a2 , . . . , at i, we need only find a finite\nset U \u2282 S such that dmax (S) = maxs\u2208U {dmax (s; S)} to establish the finiteness\nof dmax (S). To this end, we make the following definition:\nDefinition 2.1. An element u \u2208 S is called maximally reduced if, for each i,\nwith 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t, there exists a factorization (c1 , c2 , . . . , ct ) of u with maximal\nlength such that ci = 0.\nWe do not need t distinct factorizations with maximal length to satisfy the\ndefinition of maximally reduced, as the next example shows.\nExample 2.2. In S = h7, 8, 13i, the element 48 has the following factorizations:\n\u2022 (0, 6, 0)\n\u2022 (5, 0, 1)\n\u2022 (2, 1, 2)\nNotice that only the first two have maximal length. The first factorization with\nmaximal length has a 0 in the first and third entries, and the second factorization\nwith maximal length has a 0 in the second entry. Thus 48 is a maximally reduced\nelement.\nTheorem 2.3. Let U be the set of maximally reduced elements in S. Then we\nhave the following:\n1. U is a finite set\n2. dmax (S) = maxs\u2208U {dmax (s; S)}.\n\n3\n\n\fThus, dmax (S) is finite.\nProof. To show that U is a finite set, it suffices to prove that the maximally\nPt\nreduced elements are bounded above. To see this, set N = (a1 \u2212 1) i=2 ai .\nSuppose that s > N , and that C = (0, c2 , . . . , ct ) is a representation of s. Then\nthere exists j, with 2 \u2264 j \u2264 t, such that cj \u2265 a1 , and so (aj , c2 , . . . , cj \u2212\na1 , . . . , ct ) is a representation of s with greater length than C. Therefore, every\nmaximal representation has a first component that is nonzero and s is not\nmaximally reduced.\nNow we need to show that dmax (S) = maxs\u2208U {dmax (s; S)}. For s \u2208 S, with\nmaximal representations {Cj = (cj,1 , cj,2 , . . . , cj,t )}, let ci = minj {cj,i }, and\nPt\nconsider the element s\u2217 = s \u2212 i=1 ci ai \u2208 S. Then it is not difficult to see that\ns\u2217 is maximally reduced and that dmax (s; S) = dmax (s\u2217 ; S).\nTheorem 2.3 outlines an algorithm\ncomputing dmax (S): We check to see\nPfor\nt\nwhich elements up to N = (a1 \u2212 1) i=2 ai are maximally reduced, and then\ntake the maximum of the dmax (s; S) where s is a maximally reduced element of\nS.\nExample 2.4. Let S = h7, 11, 13, 15i. Checking up to 234, the maximally\nreduced elements along with their maximal factorizations are\n\u2022 0; (0, 0, 0, 0)\n\u2022 22; (0, 2, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0, 1)\n\u2022 26; (0, 0, 2, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1)\n\u2022 33; (0, 3, 0, 0), (1, 0, 2, 0), (1, 1, 0, 1)\n\u2022 37; (0, 1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 0, 1), (1, 0, 0, 2)\n\u2022 44; (1, 2, 0, 1), (1, 1, 2, 0), (0, 4, 0, 0), (2, 0, 0, 2).\nTherefore, dmax (S) = 4.\nWe see from the example that we can potentially improve this algorithm\nsince we only need to check up to 44 to find the maximally reduced elements.\nWe leave this improvement as an open question.\nQuestion 2.5. Can we improve the algorithm described in Theorem 2.3?\nIn the next section we will focus on numerical semigroups with embedding\ndimension less than four, but first we consider the case when S has embedding\ndimension strictly less than three. When S = N, then every element s \u2208 S has\na unique factorization, namely, s = s * 1. Thus dmax (N) = 1. We show that\nwhen S has embedding dimension two, we also have that dmax (S) = 1.\nProposition 2.6. If S = ha1 , a2 i, then dmax (S) = 1.\n\n4\n\n\fProof. We will show that every element of S has only one maximal factorization.\nSuppose that\ns = c1 a1 + c2 a2\n\nand\n\ns = d1 a1 + d2 a2 ,\n\nwhere c1 + c2 = d1 + d2 . If c1 = d1 or c2 = d2 , then it follows that both\nc1 = d1 and c2 = d2 . If this is not the case, then we may assume without loss\nof generality that c1 > d1 . But then we have (c1 \u2212 d1 )a1 + c2 a2 = d2 a2 and\n(c1 \u2212 d1 )a1 + c2 a2 < (c1 \u2212 d1 )a2 + c2 a2\n= (c1 \u2212 d1 + c2 )a2\n= d2 a2 .\nThis is a contradiction. Since we cannot have two factorizations of an element of\nS with the same length, we certainly cannot have two with maximal length.\n\n3\n\nThe maximal denumerant of a semigroup with\nembedding dimension less than four\n\nThroughout this section, unless otherwise stated, we assume that S = ha1 , a2 , a3 i\nis a numerical semigroup with embedding dimension three. Set g = gcd(a2 \u2212\na1 , a3 \u2212 a1 ), m = (a2 \u2212 a1 )/g and n = (a3 \u2212 a1 )/g. Then\nS = ha1 , a1 + mg, a1 + ngi,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere gcd(m, n) = gcd(a1 , g) = 1. In the following lemma, we determine the\nmaximally reduced elements of S and their maximal factorizations.\nLemma 3.1. Let s be a maximally reduced element of S. Then s is a multiple\nof na2 . Moreover, if s = kna2 , then {pU + qV | p, q \u2265 0 and p + q = k} is the\nset of maximal factorizations of s where U = (0, n, 0) and V = (n \u2212 m, 0, m)\n(using the standard addition and scalar multiplication of vectors).\nProof. The element s = 0, which is always maximally reduced, has the unique\n(maximal) factorization (0, 0, 0). Certainly, s is a multiple of na2 . It is also easy\nto verify that the rest of the theorem is satisfied in this case. Now we assume\nthat s > 0. Since s is maximally reduced, there exists a maximal representation\nof s with the first component equal to 0, say D = (0, d2 , d3 ). Suppose that\nd3 6= 0. Since there exists another maximal factorization C = (c1 , c2 , 0) of s, we\nhave\ns = d2 a2 + d3 a3 > (d2 + d3 )a2 = (c1 + c2 )a2 \u2265 c1 a1 + c2 a2 = s,\nwhich is impossible. Thus, d3 = 0 and D = (0, d2 , 0).\nThe element s > 0 also has another maximal factorization E = (e1 , 0, e3 )\ndistinct from D. We now have\nd2 a2\n\n=\n\ne 1 a1 + e 3 a3 ,\n5\n\n(2)\n\n\fand\nd2 a1\n\n=\n\ne 1 a1 + e 3 a1 .\n\n(3)\n\nSubtracting Equation 3 from Equation 2 and dividing by g yields md2 = ne3 .\nSince m and n are relatively prime, we have that d2 = kn for some k > 0, and\nso s = d2 a2 = kna2 . Therefore, s is a multiple of na2 .\nNext we show that {pU + qV | p, q \u2265 0 and p + q = k} is the set of maximal\nrepresentations of the maximally reduced element s = kna2 . Notice that our\nproof of the first statement of the theorem shows that kU = (0, kn, 0) is a\nmaximal factorization of s. It is not difficult to see that pU + qV , where p, q \u2265 0\nand p + q = k, is also a factorization of s having the same length as kU . Thus,\nall of these factorizations are maximal. We still need to show that no other\nmaximal factorizations exist.\nLet C = (c1 , c2 , c3 ) be a maximal factorization of s. Similar to before, using\nthat (0, kn, 0) is a maximal factorization, we have\n(kn \u2212 c2 )a2\n\n=\n\nc1 a1 + c3 a3 ,\n\n(4)\n\n(kn \u2212 c2 )a1\n\n=\n\nc1 a1 + c3 a1 .\n\n(5)\n\nand\n\nSubtracting Equation (4) from Equation (5) and dividing by g yields m(kn \u2212\nc2 ) = nc3 . Since m and n are relatively prime, we have that kn \u2212 c2 = k \u2032 n and\nc3 = k \u2032 m for some 0 \u2264 k \u2032 \u2264 k. It follows that c2 = (k \u2212 k \u2032 )n and c1 = k \u2032 (n \u2212 m).\nTherefore, we have that C = (k \u2212 k \u2032 )U + k \u2032 V .\nFrom Lemma 3.1, we can precisely describe the set of maximally reduced\nelements. This is the content of the next theorem.\nTheorem 3.2. There exists an integer k \u2265 0 such that {0, na2 , 2na2 , . . . , kna2 }\nis the set of maximally reduced elements in S. Furthermore, dmax (ina2 ; S) =\ni + 1 for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\nProof. We already know that every maximally reduced element in S is a multiple\nof na2 . Thus, for the first statement it suffices to assume that s = hna2 is\nmaximally reduced and show this implies that s\u2032 = (h \u2212 1)na2 is also maximally\nreduced.\nIf (0, (h \u2212 1)n, 0) is not a maximal factorization of s\u2032 , then s\u2032 has a factorization C = (c1 , c2 , c3 ) such that c1 + c2 + c3 > (h \u2212 1)n. It follows that\n(c1 , c2 + n, c3 ) would be a factorization of s with length greater than hn. Therefore, (0, hn, 0) is not a maximal factorization of s, and s is not maximally\nreduced by Theorem 3.1. From this contradiction, we conclude that indeed\n(0, (h \u2212 1)n, 0) is a maximal factorization of s\u2032 . Clearly, we also have that\n((h \u2212 1)(n \u2212 m), 0, (h \u2212 1)m) is a maximal factorization of s\u2032 since it is a factorization with length (h \u2212 1)n. This shows that s\u2032 is maximally reduced.\nNow, if 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k, then ina2 is maximally reduced and by Theorem 3.1,\nits maximal factorizations are {p(0, n, 0) + q(n \u2212 m, 0, m) | p, q \u2265 0 and p + q =\n6\n\n\fi}. Since p can range from 0 to i (with q depending on p), it follows that\ndmax (ina2 ; S) = i + 1.\nOur main results, the formulas provided in Theorems 3.5 and 3.6, are both\ndependent upon Lemma 3.3. Notice that since m and n are relatively prime,\nU = hm, ni is a semigroup with embedding dimension less than three. It is well\nknown that U is a symmetric semigroup, i.e., for every z \u2208 Z, exactly one of z\nor f \u2212 z is in U , where f is the Frobenius number of U . The Frobenius number\nof U is the largest integer not in U , and we have f = mn \u2212 m \u2212 n. See [11, 12]\nfor more information concerning symmetric semigroups.\nLemma 3.3. The following are equivalent:\n(a) hna2 is not a maximally reduced element of S\n(b) (0, hn, 0) is not a maximal factorization of hna2\n(c) hmn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni.\nMoreover, dmax (S) = min{h | hmn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni}.\nProof. For (a) implies (b), if (0, hn, 0) is a maximal factorization, then so is\n(h(n \u2212 m), 0, hm). Thus hna2 is maximally reduced. For (b) implies (a), if hna2\nis maximally reduced, then by Lemma 3.1, (0, hn, 0) is a maximal factorization\nof hna2 .\nFor (b) implies (c), we may assume that a1 \u2208 hm, ni, since otherwise we\nwould have a1 \u2212 m \u2212 n \u2212 (h \u2212 1)mn 6\u2208 hm, ni. By the symmetry of hm, ni, it\nfollows that hmn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni. By assumption we have that\nhna2 = c1 a1 + c2 a2 + c3 a3\n\n(6)\n\nwhere hn < c1 +c2 +c3 . Write k = hn\u2212(c1 +c2 +c3 ). Subtracting (c1 +c2 +c3 )a1\nfrom both sides of (6), we have\nhngm \u2212 ka1 = c2 gm + c3 gn.\nSince gcd(a1 , g) = 1, it follows that k is divisible by g and so\nc2 m + c3 n = hmn \u2212 k \u2032 a1 ,\nfor some k \u2032 > 0. Thus hmn \u2212 k \u2032 a1 \u2208 hm, ni, and since a1 is as well, we have\nhmn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni.\nFor (c) implies (b), we essentially reverse these steps. Since hmn \u2212 a1 \u2208\nhm, ni, we have hmn \u2212 a1 = c2 m + c3 n where c2 , c3 \u2265 0. Multiplying both sides\nby g, adding c2 a1 + c3 a1 to both sides and rearranging gives\nhna2 = (hn + g \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 )a1 + c2 a2 + c3 a3 .\nIf we can verify that hn + g \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 \u2265 0, then (0, hn, 0) is not a maximal\nfactorization of hna2 . To do this, suppose that hn + g \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 < 0. Then, using\nthe fact that m < n, we get mhn + mg < mc2 + mc3 < mc2 + nc3 = hmn \u2212 a1 .\nIt follows that a2 = a1 + mg < 0, which is a contradiction.\n7\n\n\fBefore we prove the main results, we consider when S is generated by three elements, a1 , a2 , and a3 , that do not form the minimal generating set. In this case,\nS has embedding dimension less than three, and we have seen that dmax (S) = 1.\nThe next lemma shows that we still have dmax (S) = min{h | hmn\u2212a1 \u2208 hm, ni}.\nLemma 3.4. Let S be a numerical semigroup generated by a1 , a2 , and a3\nsuch that these element do not form the minimal generating set of S. Then\nmin{h | hmn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni} = 1, or equivalently, mn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni.\nProof. Since a1 , a2 , and a3 do not form the minimal generating set, we have\neither a2 = ka1 for k \u2265 2 or a3 = pa1 + qa2 where p + q \u2265 2. In both case we\ncan show that a1 < m + n.\nFor the former case, we have a1 + gm = ka1 . Thus gm = (k \u2212 1)a1 , and since\n(a1 , g) = 1, it follows that m = k \u2032 a1 , where 1 \u2264 k \u2032 = (k \u2212 1)/g \u2208 Z. Therefore,\na1 < m + n. For the latter case, we have a1 + gn = pa1 + q(a1 + gm). Thus\ng(n \u2212 qm) = (p + q \u2212 1)a1 , and since (a1 , g) = 1, it follows that (n \u2212 qm) = k \u2032 a1 ,\nwhere 1 \u2264 k \u2032 = (p + q \u2212 1)/g \u2208 Z. Therefore, a1 < m + n.\nNotice that if a1 < m + n, then a1 \u2212 m \u2212 n 6\u2208 hm, ni. By the symmetry of\nhm, ni, we have mn \u2212 m \u2212 n \u2212 (a1 \u2212 m \u2212 n) = mn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni.\nNext, we prove our main results with the following setting: The numerical\nsemigroup S is (perhaps non-minimally) generated by a1 , a2 , and a3 . Moreover,\nwe set g = gcd(a2 \u2212 a1 , a3 \u2212 a1 ), m = (a2 \u2212 a1 )/g and n = (a3 \u2212 a1 )/g such that\nS = ha1 , a1 + mg, a1 + ngi,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere gcd(m, n) = gcd(a1 , g) = 1.\nTheorem 3.5. Let 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < mn such that \u03b1 \u2261 \u2212a1 mod mn. We have the\nfollowing formula:\n\uf8f1 l a1 m\n\uf8f4\n,\nif \u03b1 \u2208 hm, ni\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 mn\ndmax (S) =\nl\nm\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 a1 + 1, otherwise.\nmn\nla m\nla m\n1\n1\nmn \u2212 a1 and 0 \u2264\nmn \u2212 a1 < mn. Thus\nProof. First note that \u03b1 =\nmn\nmn\nla m\nla m\n1\n1\n, then hmn \u2212 a1 \u2208\n/ hm, ni. On the other hand, if h >\n, then\nif h <\nmn\nmn\nhmn \u2212 a1 > mn and thus hmn \u2212 a1 is an element of hm,\nl ani.m\n1\nThe result now follows from Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4. If\nmn\u2212a1 \u2208 hm, ni,\nmn\nla m\n1\nthen dmax (S) = min{h | hmn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni} =\n. Otherwise, dmax (S) =\nmn\nla m\n1\nmin{h | hmn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni} =\n+ 1.\nmn\nTheorem 3.6. If x and y are integers such that mx + ny = a1 , then\nlxm l y m\n+\n.\ndmax (S) =\nn\nm\n8\n\n\fProof. Note that a1 = mx + ny = mu + nv implies that m(x \u2212 u) = n(v \u2212 y).\nSince gcd(m, n) = 1, we have that x \u2212 u = kn and v \u2212 y = km for some integer\nk.\nThus we see that\nl u m l v m \u0018 x + kn \u0019 \u0018 y \u2212 km \u0019\n+\n=\n+\nn\nm\nn\nm\nlx\nm ly\nm\n=\n+k +\n\u2212k\nlm\nln\nym\nxm\n+k+\n\u2212k\n=\nm\nln\nm\nl\nm\nx\ny\n=\n+\n.\nn\nm\nIn other words, the formula is independent of the linear combination that we\nchoose.\nNow let k = dmax (S), so that, by Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4, we have k =\nmin{h | hmn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni}. Thus, kmn \u2212 a1 = c1 m + c2 n for some c1 , c2 \u2265 0.\nFurthermore, c1 < n and c2 < m since otherwise, (k \u2212 1)mn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni. We\nnow have that\n\u0018\n\u0019 \u0018\n\u0019\nlxm l y m\nkn \u2212 c1\n\u2212c2\n+\n=\n+\nn\nm\nn\nm\n\u0019 \u0018\n\u0019\n\u0018\n\u2212c2\n\u2212c1\n+\n= k+\nn\nm\n= k\n= dmax (S).\n\nOf course, the formulas presented in Theorems 3.5 and 3.6 are most interesting when S has embedding dimension three, since otherwise, we know that\ndmax (S) = 1. However, the fact that these formulas work for all numerical semigroups with embedding dimension less than four naturally raises the following\nquestion:\nQuestion 3.7. When S has embedding dimension less than t + 1, where t \u2265 4,\ndo there exist formulas dependent upon a set of t generators analogous to those\nin Theorems 3.5 and 3.6 that yield the maximal denumerant of S?\n\n4\n\nThe maximal denumerant of basic semigroups\n\nWe begin with the following proposition that will aid in some computations.\nProposition 4.1. Let\n\u0006 a1S\u0007= ha1 , a2 , a3 i be a semigroup. If either m or n divides\n.\na1 , then dmax (S) = mn\n9\n\n\fProof. Assume that m divides a\u00061 . \u0007 Then\n\u0006 kma\u00071 =\u0006 km\n\u0007 for some k > 0, and by\na1\nTheorem 3.6 we have dmax (S) = nk = nm\n= mn\n. We have a similar proof\nwhenever n divides a1 .\nRecall our setting: S = ha1 , a1 +mg, a1 +ngi, where g = gcd(a2 \u2212a1 , a3 \u2212a1 ),\nm = (a2 \u2212 a1 )/g and n = (a3 \u2212 a1 )/g. From Theorems 3.5 and 3.6, we see that\nif T = ha1 , a1 + m, a1 + ni, then dmax (S) = dmax (T ). Thus, we will restrict our\nattention to the following class of numerical semigroups.\nDefinition 4.2. The semigroup S = ha1 , a2 , a3 i is called basic if gcd(a2 \u2212\na1 , a3 \u2212 a1 ) = 1.\nProposition 4.3. Let S = ha1 , a2 , a3 i be a basic semigroup. Then\n1. If 4a1 = 2a2 + a3 , then dmax (S) = 2\n2. If 3a1 = a2 + a3 , then dmax (S) = 2.\n3. If 4a1 < 2a2 + a3 and 3a1 6= a2 + a3 , then dmax (S) = 1\nProof. For \u0006the\u0007 first\nby subtracting 3a1 , we have a1 = 2m + n. Thus,\n\u0006 1 case,\n\u0007\ndmax (S) = n2 + m\n. Since 1 \u2264 m < n, we have dmax (S)\nfor\n\u0007\n\u0006 \u0007= 2.\u0006 1Similarly,\n= 2.\nthe second case, we obtain a1 = m + n. Thus dmax (S) = n1 + m\nFor the third case, consider when a1 < m+n. Then a1 \u2212m\u2212n < 0, and hence,\nis not in hm, ni. By the symmetry of S, we have mn \u2212 m \u2212 n \u2212 (a1 \u2212 m \u2212 n) =\nmn \u2212 a1 \u2208 hm, ni. By Lemma 3.3, dmax (S) = 1. On the other hand, if we\nhave m + n < a1 < 2m + n, then 0 < a1 \u2212 m \u2212 n < m. Again we have that\na1 \u2212 m \u2212 n 6\u2208 hm, ni, and it follows that dmax (S) = 1.\nRemark 4.4. Note that Proposition 4.3 is not exhaustive in the sense that when\n4a1 > 2a2 +a3 , there are more possibilities to consider. Nevertheless, for a given\na1 , Proposition 4.3 does address all but finitely many situations.\nThe next example demonstrates how we can easily compute the maximal\ndenumerant of all basic semigroups with a fixed multiplicity.\nExample 4.5. Let S = h7, a2 , a3 i be a basic semigroup with multiplicity a1 = 7.\nUsing Proposition 4.3, we carry out the following steps:\n1. Solve 28 = 2a2 + a3 to get the pairs of solutions (8, 12) and (9, 10).\n2. Solve 21 = a2 + a3 to get the pairs of solutions (8, 13), (9, 12), and (10, 11).\n3. Solve 4a1 > 2a2 + a3 to get the pairs of solutions (8, 9), (8, 10), and (8, 11).\nThe semigroups from the first two steps will have maximal denumerant equal\nto 2. The maximal denumerant of the semigroups in the third step can be computed using Proposition 4.1. All other basic semigroups with multiplicity 7 have\nmaximal denumerant equal to 1. The list below summarizes our computations.\n1. dmax (h7, 8, 9i) = 4\n10\n\n\f2. dmax (h7, 8, 10i) = 3\n3. dmax (S) = 2 if S is one of the following:\n(a) h7, 8, 11i\n(b) h7, 8, 12i\n(c) h7, 9, 10i\n(d) h7, 8, 13i\n(e) h7, 9, 12i\n(f) h7, 10, 11i\n4. dmax (S) = 1 otherwise.\nThis example raises a natural question: for which values of m and n is\ndmax (ha1 , a1 + m, a1 + ni) maximized? Considering Theorem 3.5, if m = 1, then\nhm, ni = N, and dmax (S) = \u2308a1 /n\u2309. This is maximized when n = 2. If m > 1,\nthen since a1 \u2265 3 we have \u2308a1 /mn\u2309 + 1 \u2264 \u2308a1 /2\u2309. Hence dmax (S) is largest\nwhen m = 1 and n = 2.\n\nReferences\n[1] Amos, J.; Chapman, S.
