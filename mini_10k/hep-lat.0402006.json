Introduction.\nQCD is an asymptotically free theory, thus its high temperature and high density phases\nare dominated by partons (quarks and gluons) as degrees of freedom rather than hadrons.\nThese phases play an important role in the particle physics of the early universe, of neutron\nstars and of heavy ion collisions (for a clear theoretical introduction and a review see [1, 2]).\nExtensive experimental work has been done with heavy ion collisions at GSI, CERN\nand Brookhaven to study the strong interactions at high temperatures and non-vanishing\nbaryon densities (the latter correspond to non-vanishing baryonic chemical potentials) and\nto explore the \u03bc-T phase diagram. It is a long-standing open question, whether a critical\npoint (E) exists on the \u03bc-T plane, and particularly how to predict theoretically its location\n[3, 4]. At this point E the phase transition is of second order and long wavelength fluctuations appear, which results in characteristic experimental consequences, similar to critical\nopalescence. Passing close enough to (\u03bcE ,TE ) one expects simultaneous appearance of signatures. The observables exhibit non-monotonic dependence on the control parameters [5],\nsince one can miss the critical point on either of two sides.\nThe location of this critical point is an unambiguous, non-perturbative prediction of\nthe QCD Lagrangian. Unfortunately, until recently no ab initio, lattice analysis based on\nQCD was done to locate the endpoint. Models with infinitely large strange quark mass\n(ms =\u221e) were used (e.g. [3]), suggesting that \u03bcE \u2248 700 MeV. The result is sensitive to\nthe strange quark mass (\u03bcE should be smaller for smaller ms ). For realistic cases these\ntechniques can not predict the value of \u03bcE even to within a factor of 2-3.\nLattice QCD at non-vanishing baryon density should, in principle, give an unambiguous answer. Though QCD at finite \u03bc can be formulated on the lattice [6], standard\nMonte-Carlo techniques can not be used at \u03bc 6= 0. The reason is that for non-vanishing\nreal \u03bc the functional measure \u2013thus, the determinant of the Euclidean Dirac operator\u2013\nis complex. This fact spoils any Monte-Carlo technique based on importance sampling.\nSeveral suggestions were studied earlier to solve the problem. Unfortunately, none of them\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fwas able to give the phase line or locate (\u03bcE ,TE ). About two years ago new techniques\nappeared, with which moderate chemical potentials could be reached on the lattice.\nIn two recent papers we proposed a new method [7, 8] to study lattice QCD at finite\nT and \u03bc. The idea was to produce an ensemble of QCD configurations at \u03bc=0 and at\nthe corresponding transition temperature Tc (or at any other physically motivated point\nfor which importance sampling works). Then we determined the Boltzmann weights [9]\nof these configurations at \u03bc 6= 0 and at T lowered to the transition temperatures at this\nnon-vanishing \u03bc. An ensemble of configurations at a transition point was reweighted to an\nensemble of configurations at another transition point. With this technique a much better\noverlap was observed than by reweighting pure hadronic ensemble to a transition one [10].\nWe illustrated the applicability of the method in nf =4 dynamical QCD [7] and in nf =2+1\ndynamical QCD [8]. The phase line with the critical end-point [8] and the equation of state\n[11, 12] were determined.\nA less CPU demanding, truncated version of the overlap-improving multi-parameter\nreweighting was also applied using an improved lattice action. The approach can be summarized as follows. Instead of evaluating the Boltzmann weights exactly one can expand\nit in the chemical potential and use the first terms of the expansion. This modified technique was also able to give the phase diagram [13] and the equation of state [14] (estimates\nbased on derivative extrapolation for the chiral endpoint was also reported in conference\nproceedings [15, 16]). The success of the overlap-improving multi-parameter reweighting\nwas analyzed in Ref. [17].\nA completely independent method is based on the the fact that at imaginary chemical\npotential importance sampling works. The result on the phase digram can be analytically\ncontinued to real chemical potentials. This technique gave the phase line both in nf =2\n[18] and in nf =4 [19], which are consistent with the results of the overlap-improving multiparameter reweighting method [7, 8, 13]. Analytic continuation was also used to estimate\nthe location of the critical endpoint [20] for nf =3.\nRecently several other new techniques were suggested (see e.g. [21, 22, 23]), which will\nbe most probably tested in the near future. The recent developments of lattice QCD at\nnon-vanishing chemical potentials are reviewed by Refs. [24].\nIn this paper we use our original suggestion [7, 8] and evaluate the reweighting Boltzmann factors exactly. We determine the volume (V) dependence of the zeros of the partition\nfunction on the complex gauge coupling (\u03b2) plane. Based on this volume dependence we\ndetermine the type of the transition as a function of \u03bc. The endpoint \u03bcE is given by\nthe value at which the crossover disappears and finite volume scaling predicts a first order\nphase transition. These finite T calculations are done on Lt = 4 lattices. In order to set the\nphysical scale we determine the pion, kaon and rho masses (m\u03c0 , mK , m\u03c1 ), and the Sommer\n[25] scale (R0 ) at T =0. Our quark masses are realistic, the strange quark mass and the\nlight quark masses are set about to their physical values. Having determined the lattice\nspacing we transform our result to physical units and give Tc , the location of (\u03bcE ,TE ) and\nshow the phase diagram separating the hadronic phase and the QGP.\nThe present work is a significant improvement on our previous analysis by two means.\nWe increased the physical volume by a factor of three and decreased the light quark masses\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fby a factor of three, down to their physical values. Due to these improvements the computational effort of the present work was 140 times larger than that of the previous analysis\n[8]. As expected, decreasing the light quark masses resulted in a smaller \u03bcE . Increasing the\nvolumes did not influence the results, which indicates the reliability of the finite volume\nanalysis. In order to give the final answer to (\u03bcE ,TE ) the most important step remained\nis the continuum extrapolation. Note, however, that for the present physical problem decreasing the lattice spacing by a factor of 2 increases the CPU costs by approximately three\norders of magnitude.\nThe remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we summarize the\noverlap-improving multi-parameter reweighting technique and the method of the Lee-Yang\nzeros, which can be used to separate the crossover and first order transition regions. Section\n3 contains the details of the T6=0 and T=0 simulations. Those who are not interested in\nthe lattice details could directly move to Section 4, in which we present our results and\nconclude.\n\n2. Overlap-improving multi-parameter reweighting at \u03bc 6= 0.\nThe partition function of lattice QCD with nf degenerate staggered quarks (for an introduction see e.g. [26]) is given by the functional integral of the bosonic action Sb at gauge\ncoupling \u03b2 over the link variables U , weighted by the determinant of the quark matrix M ,\nwhich can be rewritten [7] as\nZ\nZ(\u03b2, m, \u03bc) = DU exp[\u2212Sb (\u03b2, U )][det M (m, \u03bc, U )]nf /4\nZ\n= DU exp[\u2212Sb (\u03b2w , U )][det M (mw , \u03bcw , U )]nf /4\n(2.1)\n)\n(\n\u0014\n\u0015\ndet M (m, \u03bc, U ) nf /4\n,\nexp[\u2212Sb (\u03b2, U ) + Sb (\u03b2w , U )]\ndet M (mw , \u03bcw , U )\nwhere m is the quark mass, \u03bc is the quark chemical potential and nf is the number of\nflavours. For non-degenerate masses one uses simply the product of several quark matrix\ndeterminants on the 1/4-th power. Standard importance sampling works and can be used\nto collect an ensemble of configurations at mw , \u03b2w and \u03bcw (with e.g. Re(\u03bcw )=0 or nonvanishing isospin chemical potential). It means we treat the terms in the curly bracket\nas an observable \u2013which is measured on each independent configuration\u2013 and the rest as\nthe measure. By simultaneously changing several parameters e.g. \u03b2 and \u03bc one can ensure\nthat even the mismatched measure at \u03b2w and \u03bcw samples the regions where the original\nintegrand with \u03b2 and \u03bc is large. In practice the determinant is evaluated at some \u03bc\nand a Ferrenberg-Swendsen reweighting [9] is performed for the gauge coupling \u03b2. The\nfractional power in eq. (2.1) can be taken by using the fact that at \u03bc = \u03bcw the ratio of\nthe determinants is 1 and the ratio is a continuous function of the chemical potential.

The upper part is a summary of the Lee-Yang zeros obtained\nat different chemical potentials for mu,d =0.0092 and ms =0.25. We indicate by 6,8,10,12 and \u221e\nthe spatial extensions \u2013and their extrapolation\u2013 of our Lt = 4 lattices. The lower part shows the\nmeasured T = 0 observables for three \u03b2 and three mu,d values at ms =0.25 on 123 * 24 lattices.\n\ndifference between a crossover and a first order phase transition. At a first order phase\ntransition the free energy \u221d log Z(\u03b2) is non-analytic. Clearly, a phase transition can appear\nonly in the V\u2192 \u221e limit, but not in a finite V . Nevertheless, the partition function has\nLee-Yang zeros at finite V. These are at \"unphysical\" complex values of the parameters,\nin our case at complex \u03b2-s. For a system with a first order phase transition these zeros\napproach the real axis in the V\u2192 \u221e limit (the detailed analysis suggests a 1/V scaling).\nThis V\u2192 \u221e limit generates the non-analyticity of the free energy. For a system with\ncrossover the free energy is analytic, thus the zeros do not approach the real axis in the\nV\u2192 \u221e limit.\n\n3. T 6= 0 and T = 0 simulations for nf =2+1.\nUsing the formulation described above we study 2+1 flavour QCD at T 6= 0 on Lt =\n4, Ls = 6, 8, 10, 12 lattices with mu,d = 0.0092 and ms = 0.25 as bare quark masses.\nNote, that these mass parameters approximately correspond to their physical values. At\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fT = 0 we use 123 * 24 lattices. Three different couplings (\u03b2=5.090, 5.160, 5.190) are studied\nin order to determine the non-perturbative \u03b2-function. Chiral extrapolation in the light\nquark masses at T =0 are done by using three different mass parameters (mu,d =0.02, 0.04,\n0.06). For each parameter set 3000 configurations were generated. For generating the field\nconfigurations the R algorithm is applied. The microcanonical stepsize is always set to half\nof the light quark mass. We use a modified version [28] of the MILC collaboration's code\n[29].\nAt T 6= 0 we determined the complex valued Lee-Yang zeros, \u03b20 , for different V-s as a\nfunction of \u03bc. Their V\u2192 \u221e limit was calculated by a \u03b20 (V ) = \u03b20\u221e + \u03b6/V extrapolation.\nThe results (listed in Table 1) are obtained by generating 100,000; 100,000; 100,000 and\n150,000 configurations on our Ls =6,8,10 and 12 lattices, respectively. The determinant\ncalculation was carried out after every 50 trajectories. Thus our results are based on a few\nthousand independent configurations.\nFigure 1 shows Im(\u03b20\u221e ) as a function of \u03bc enlarged around the endpoint \u03bcend . The\npicture is simple and reflects the physical expectations. For small \u03bc-s the extrapolated\nIm(\u03b20\u221e ) is inconsistent with a vanishing value, and the prediction is a crossover. Increasing \u03bc the value of Im(\u03b20\u221e ) decreases, thus the transition becomes consistent with a first\norder phase transition. The statistical error was determined by a jackknife analysis using\nsubsamples of the total Ls =6,8,10 and 12 partition functions. Our primary result in lattice\nunits is \u03bcend = 0.1825(75).\n\nFigure 1: Im(\u03b20\u221e ) as a function of the chemical potential.\n\nTable 1 contains also the T = 0 results. To set the physical scale we used an average\nobtained from R0 (0.5 fm) and m\u03c1 (770 MeV). Note, that these two quantities give somewhat different scales (the difference is fairly small, approximately 10-15%). This difference\nis expected to dissappear when one approaches the continuum limit with physical quark\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fmasses.1\nSetting the scale leads to the final results of the analysis. As we already discussed, the\nquark masses, used to determine the endpoint, correspond approximately to their physical\nvalues. The pion to rho mass ratio, extrapolated to our T 6= 0 parameters, is 0.188(2) (its\nphysical value is 0.179), whereas the pion to K mass ratio in the same limit is 0.267(1) (its\nphysical value is 0.277).\nAlong the transition line \u03b2 decreases, thus the lattice spacing increases. During the\nreweighting procedure we did not change the lattice quark masses, thus the quark masses\nchanged in physical units. As a consequence, the transition line slightly deviates from the\nline of constant physics. We corrected for this effect by using our previous results at larger\nmud [8] and by following the observation that transition lines for slightly different quark\nmasses are practically parallel (see [11, 12]).\nLet us estimate the applicability of the method approaching the continuum limit.\nIn the present analysis with physical quark masses the evaluation of the eigenvalues was\nsomewhat less costly than the production of the configurations. Extending the analysis\nto even larger volumes, approximately upto 4*163 , the eigenvalue determination remains\nsubdominant. Using these larger volumes reduces the error on \u03bcend to a level, which is\nnot even needed (uncertainties due to finite lattice spacing are more important). For finer\nlattices the eigenvalue evaluation goes with L9s and the configuration production goes at\nleast with L9s . According to numerical estimates [11, 12, 17] the applicability range of\nthe overlap-improving multi-parameter reweighting technique, along the transition line,\nscales with \u03bc \u221d V \u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2248 1/3. (Note, that the systematic study of the lattice spacing\ndependence of \u03b3 has not been performed yet.) In the scaling region the chemical potential\nof the endpoint is constant in physical units. It scales with V 0.25 in lattice units for fixed\nphysical volumes. Taking into account the marginal difference between \u03b3 \u2248 1/3 and 0.25,\none concludes that the determinant evaluation remains subdominant and even with the\npresent technique one might successfully approach smaller lattice spacings.\n\n4. Results and conclusions.\nFigure 2 shows the phase diagram in physical units, thus T as a function of \u03bcB , the baryonic\nchemical potential (which is three times larger then the quark chemical potential).\nThe transition temperature at vanishing baryonic chemical potential is Tc =164\u00b12 MeV.\nNote, that this value is somewhat smaller than our previous result (Tc =172\u00b13 MeV of Ref.\n[8]). This is a known phenomenon: smaller quark mass results in smaller transition temperature (see e.g. [30]).\nThe curvature of the crossover line separating the QGP and the hadronic phases is\ngiven by T /Tc = 1 \u2212 C\u03bc2B /Tc2 with C=0.0032(1). This value is somewhat smaller than our\nprevious curvature [8] or other values in the literature [13, 15, 14, 18]. Note, that compared\nto other analyses, we took into account an additional effect which reduced the value of C.\n1\n\nNote, that this difference is smaller than the difference in our previous analysis [8]. This improvement\nis due to the choice of the physical light quark masses.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fThe small change of the mass parameter on the line of constant physics (caused by the\nchange of the lattice spacing) slightly decreases the curvature.\nThe endpoint is at TE = 162 \u00b1 2 MeV, \u03bcE = 360 \u00b1 40 MeV. As expected, \u03bcE decreased\nas we decreased the light quark masses down to their physical values (at approximately\nthree-times larger mu,d the critical point was at \u03bcE =720 MeV; see [8]).\n\nFigure 2: The phase diagram in physical units. Dotted line illustrates the crossover, solid line the\nfirst order phase transition. The small square shows the endpoint. The depicted errors originate\nfrom the reweighting procedure. Note, that an overall additional error of 1.3% comes from the\nerror of the scale determination at T=0. Combining the two sources of uncertainties one obtains\nTE = 162 \u00b1 2 MeV and \u03bcE = 360 \u00b1 40 MeV.\n\nThe above result is a significant improvement on our previous analysis [8] by two\nmeans. We increased the physical volume by a factor of three and decreased the light\nquark masses by a factor of three. Increasing the volumes did not influence the results,\nwhich indicates the reliability of the finite volume analysis. Clearly, more work is needed\nto get the final values. Most importantly one has to extrapolate to the continuum limit.\nThis work was partially supported by Hungarian Science Foundation grants No. OTKA37615/34980/29803/M37071/OMFB1548/OMMU-708.
