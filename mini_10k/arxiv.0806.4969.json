Introduction\nIn certain B \u2192 V1 V2 decays (Vi is a light charmless\nvector meson) dominated by b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304 penguin transitions in the standard model (SM), an unexpected observation has been made. Considering that the final\nparticles have spin 1, it is straightforward to see that a\ngiven B decay into two vector mesons can be analyzed\nas three separated B decays \u2013 one for each polarization\nof the vector states (one longitudinal, two transverse)\n\u2013 into two spinless particles. Naively, the transverse\namplitudes are suppressed by a factor of size mV /mB\n(V is one of the vector mesons) with respect to the longitudinal amplitude. As such, one expects the fraction\nof transverse decays, fT , to be much less than the fraction of longitudinal decays, fL . However, it has been\nmeasured that these two fractions are roughly equal\nin B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 [1] and B 0(+) \u2192 \u03c10(+) K \u22170 [2, 3] (see\nTable I for recent measurements).\nMode\n\u03c6K \u22170 [4, 5, 6]\n\u03c6K \u2217+ [1, 5, 7]\n\u03c1+ K \u22170 [2, 3]\n\u03c10 K \u22170 [3]\n\u03c1\u2212 K \u2217+ [3]\n\u03c10 K \u2217+ [3]\n\u03c6K2\u2217 (1430)0 [4]\n\nB(10\u22126 )\n9.5 \u00b1 0.9\n10.0 \u00b1 1.1\n9.2 \u00b1 1.5\n5.6 \u00b1 1.6\n(< 12.0)\n(3.6+1.9\n\u22121.8 )\n7.8 \u00b1 1.3\n\nfL\n\nf\u22a5\n\n0.49 \u00b1 0.04 0.27+0.04\n\u22120.03\n0.50 \u00b1 0.05 0.20 \u00b1 0.05\n0.48 \u00b1 0.08\n0.57 \u00b1 0.12\n(0.9 \u00b1 0.2)\n0.85 \u00b1 0.08 0.05 \u00b1 0.05\n\nTable I Measurements of the branching fraction B,\nlongitudinal polarization fraction fL and fraction of\nparity-odd transverse amplitude f\u22a5 , for B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 , \u03c1K \u2217 ,\nand \u03c6K2\u2217 (1430)0 , expected to proceed through a b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304\ntransition [8, 9]. Numbers in parentheses indicate\nobservables measured with less than 4\u03c3 significance.\n\nThe differences between the measurements and the\nnaive expectations could be interpreted in favour of\nthe presence of physics beyond the SM [10], though\nnone of these discrepancies has been statistically significant. On the other hand, two explanations remain\nas possible solutions within the SM when they are con-\n\nsidered one at a time: penguin annihilation [11] and\nrescattering [12, 13].\nThese two explanations account for a large fT /fL in\nb\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304 decays. However, the key point is that a large\nfT /fL is also predicted in certain b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decays [14].\nThe measurement of fT /fL in these b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decays will\nallow us to test penguin annihilation and rescattering as the explanations of the observed fT /fL ratio in\nB \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 decays [15]. Besides, we also investigate\ntheir predictions in B \u2192 V T decays (T is a tensor\nmeson) [16]. Since in this case there are too three\npolarizations, fT /fL can be measured. This ratio has\nbeen experimentally determined in B \u2192 \u03c6K2\u2217 [4] (see\nTable I) and it is small. The potential solutions must\nalso explain fT /fL in B \u2192 V T decays. In this paper, we study this matter, both within the SM and\nassuming new physics (NP).\n\n2. SM Explanations of fT /fL in B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217\nWe focus on B \u2192 V1 V2 decays. In this case the\namplitude for the process is given in the linear polarization basis by\n1\ni\nM = A0 \u03b5\u22171L *\u03b5\u22172L \u2212 \u221a Ak ~\u03b5\u22171T *~\u03b5\u22172T \u2212 \u221a A\u22a5 ~\u03b5\u22171T \u00d7~\u03b5\u22172T * p\u0302 ,\n2\n2\n(1)\nwhere the polarizations of the final-state vector\nmesons (\u03b5\u2217i ) are either longitudinal (A0 ), or transverse\nto their directions of motion and parallel (Ak ) or perpendicular (A\u22a5 ) to one another. Along this article we\nalso make use of the helicity basis for \u221a\nthe transverse\npolarizations, where A\u00b1 = (Ak \u00b1 A\u22a5 )/ 2.\nThe relative fractions into V meson states with longitudinal and transverse polarizations is\nfL =\n\n|A0\n\n|2\n\n|A0 |2\n|A+ |2 + |A\u2212 |2\n, fT =\n,\n2\n2\n+ |A+ | + |A\u2212 |\n|A0 |2 + |A+ |2 + |A\u2212 |2\n\nwhere fT = (1 \u2212 fL ). Moreover, we can define the\nrelative fraction into final states with perpendicular\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFlavor Physics and CP Violation Conference, Taipei, 2008\npolarizations as\nf\u22a5 =\n\n|A0\n\n|2\n\n|A\u22a5 |2\n.\n+ |A+ |2 + |A\u2212 |2\n\nAs we noted in the introduction, final-state particles\nin B \u2192 V T decays have also three possible polarizations. Therefore, the amplitude for these decays can\nbe decomposed in the same way as in Eq. (1).\nWe stated above that there are two potential SM\nsolutions for the polarization puzzle observed in B \u2192\n\u03c6K \u2217 . In this section we review these two explanations.\nWe begin with penguin annihilation in the context\nof QCD factorization (QCDF) [17]. Normally, annihilation contributions are expected to be small as they\nare higher order in the 1/mb expansion, and thus ignored. However, within QCDf, it is possible that the\ncoefficients of these terms are large [11]. Penguin annihilation is not calculable in QCDf because of divergences which can be parametrized in terms of unknown quantities chosen to fit the data in B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 .\nThe penguin annihilation amplitude arises only from\npenguin diagrams with an internal t quark.\nWe now discuss the second explanation: rescattering [12, 13]. Rescattering effects involving charm intermediate states can generate large transverse polarization. In a particular picture [12] of this solution,\nheavy charm mesons rescatter to B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 . Then,\nif the transverse polarization is not reduced in the\nscattering process, this mechanism will lead to a large\nfT /fL.\nWith the previous paragraph we complete our brief\nreview about the different physical origin of the two\nexplanations. We now take a look at the similarities of\ncalculation. In order to see this, consider the penguin\ncontribution Pq for the decay b\u0304 \u2192 q\u0304q \u2032 q\u0304 \u2032 (q = d, s,\nq \u2032 = u, d, s):\n\u2217\nPq = Vub\nVuq Pu + Vcb\u2217 Vcq Pc + Vtb\u2217 Vtq Pt\n\u2217\n= Vcb Vcq (Pc \u2212 Pu ) + Vtb\u2217 Vtq (Pt \u2212 Pu ) .\n\nBoth in penguin annihilation and rescattering, the effect of the dominant contribution to the transverse\namplitudes is simply the addition of one term in Pt\nand Pc respectively. Below we follow the following\nprescription: we take into account the additional SM\neffects by adding a single amplitude to represent the\ndominant contribution to the transverse amplitudes.\n\n3. B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 Decays\nBoth penguin annihilation and rescattering explain\nthe fT /fL ratio in the b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304 decay B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 by modifying the penguin amplitude. A similar modification\nmust appear in some b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decays. Then, the question that we intend to reply in this section is how their\neffects appear in B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 decays.\n\nWithin the diagrammatic approach [18], the three\nB \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 amplitudes are given mainly by three diagrams: the color-favored and color-suppressed tree\namplitudes T r and C, and the gluonic penguin amplitude P ,\n\u221a\n\u2212 2A(B + \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c10 ) = T r + C ,\n\u2212A(Bd0 \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 ) = T r + P + R ,\n\u221a\n\u2212 2A(Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 ) = C \u2212 P \u2212 R .\nHere R stands for the single extra term arising from\nthe new penguin annihilation or rescattering contribution. Some immediate conclusions can be extracted\nfrom the above equations. First, since a modification\nof P is involved, fT /fL in B + \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c10 will not be\naffected. This agrees with observation (see Table II).\nSecond, in order to calculate fT /fL , it is necessary to\nestimate the size of R. As discussed earlier, rescattering and penguin annihilation affects the penguin\namplitude P ; thus, |R| \u223c |P |. This shows that fT /fL\nis expected to be small in Bd0 \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 , since it is\nproportional to |R|2 /|T r|2 \u223c |P |2 /|T r|2 . This also\nagrees with observation (Table II). Finally, fT /fL can\nbe large in Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 since the contributions to the\ntransverse and longitudinal polarizations are the same\nsize. It will be interesting to measure this precisely.\nMode\n\nB(10\u22126 )\n\nfL\n\n\u03c1 \u03c1 [19] 18.2 \u00b1 3.0 0.912+0.044\n\u22120.045\n0.976+0.028\n\u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 [20]\n24.2+3.0\n\u22120.024\n\u22123.2\n\u03c10 \u03c10 [21] (1.07 \u00b1 0.38) (0.86+0.12\n\u22120.14 )\n0 +\n\nTable II Measurements of the branching fraction B and\nlongitudinal polarization fraction fL for B + and Bd0\nmeson decays into \u03c1\u03c1 final states. Numbers in\nparentheses indicate observables measured with less than\n4\u03c3 significance.\n\nThere are some further tests to be performed. Since\nthere is only one added amplitude, one has |A+ (Bd0 \u2192\n\u03c10 \u03c10 )| = |\u0100\u2212 (B\u0304d0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 )|, and similarly for A\u2212 and\n\u0100+ (where A\u00b1 are given in the helicity basis and \u0100\u00b1\nstands for the corresponding amplitudes in the CP conjugated decay). If this is not found, penguin annihilation and rescattering will be ruled out. Another\nway to probe the SM explanations is by using SU(3)\n \u0304\nsince the extra transverse amplitudes, |R| (b\u0304 \u2192 d)\n\u2032\nand |R | (b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304), are related by flavor symmetries.\nThis allows us to estimate fT /fL in Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 from\nB + \u2192 \u03c1+ K \u22170 decays. If we assume that SU(3) is\nan exact symmetry, we obtain an explicit relation between |R| and |R\u2032 |: R = |Vtd(cd) /Vts(cs) |R\u2032 in penguin\nannihilation (rescattering). Thus, we can obtain the\nfT /fL ratio in Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 by using experimental data\non B + \u2192 \u03c1+ K \u22170 decays, and we find\n|AT (B + \u2192 \u03c1+ K \u22170 )|2 = (5.10 \u00b1 1.14) \u00d7 10\u221216 GeV2 ,\n|AL (Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 )|2 = (2.10 \u00b1 0.81) \u00d7 10\u221216 GeV2 ,\n\n\f3\n\nFlavor Physics and CP Violation Conference, Taipei, 2008\nleading to\nfT /fL (Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 ) = |Vtd /Vts |2 (2.43 \u00b1 1.08) .\nThis result agrees with data taken directly from Bd0 \u2192\n\u03c10 \u03c10 (see Table II):\nfT /fL (Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 ) = (1 \u2212 fL )/fL = 0.16 \u00b1 0.15 .\nThe agreement is good because of the large errors,\nmaking the hypothesis of no violation of SU(3) a consistent assumption at this accuracy level. Equally,\nthe measurement does not give a definite answer as\nto whether fT /fL is large or small. Another point is\nrelated to this: if central values are taken, fT /fL is\nnot large after all. This shows that fT /fL is not guaranteed to be large in Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 . The reason for this\nis that, due to the additional amplitude C, fL can be\nbig, making fT /fL small. There is a further complication: if C contributes significantly to the transverse\npolarization, as it could be the case in QCDf, then a\ntest of the explanations might be performed by means\nof a time-dependent angular analysis (see [15] for details). The lesson here is that it is best to consider\nb\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decays for which fT /fL is expected to be large\nand which receive only one dominant contribution to\nthe transverse polarization.\n\n4. U-spin Pairs\nWe have previously stressed the idea of measuring\nfT /fL in b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decays. But this raises the question:\nhow do we choose the b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decay to study? U-spin\nsymmetry can help us to investigate this issue. Pairs\nof B decays which are related by U-spin are given in\nRef. [22]. In B \u2192 V V form, these are\n1. Bd0 \u2192 K \u2217+ \u03c1\u2212 and Bs \u2192 \u03c1+ K \u2217\u2212 ,\n2. Bs \u2192 K \u2217+ K \u2217\u2212 and Bd0 \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 ,\n3. Bd0 \u2192 K \u22170 \u03c10 and Bs \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 \u03c10 ,\n4. B + \u2192 K \u22170 \u03c1+ and B + \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u2217+ ,\n5. Bs \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 and Bd0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u22170 .\nIn all cases, the first decay is \u2206S = 1 (b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304); the\n \u0304 The procedure here is\nsecond is \u2206S = 0 (b\u0304 \u2192 d).\nto measure the polarizations in the b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304 decay, and\ncompare them with the measurements in the corresponding b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decay.\nAs noted in the past section, the best b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decays to be considered in the tests are those with an\nexpected large fT /fL ratio and with only one contribution to the transverse amplitude. Given this, the best\npossibilities are the last two pairs: (i) B + \u2192 K \u22170 \u03c1+\n \u0304 and (ii)\n(b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304) and B + \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u2217+ (b\u0304 \u2192 d)\n \u0304\nBs \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 (b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304) and Bd0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u22170 (b\u0304 \u2192 d).\n\nWe urge the measurement of fT /fL in these pairs of\ndecays.\nThe explanations of fT /fL in B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 then make\nthree predictions :\n\u2022 fT /fL is expected to be large in both the b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304\ndecay and the corresponding b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decay.\n\u2022 |A+ | and |\u0100\u2212 | are expected to be equal in both\nthe B and B\u0304 decays, and similarly for A\u2212 and\n\u0100+ .\n\u2022 R\u2032 and R can be extracted from the b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304 and\nb\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decays, respectively. These should be\nrelated by SU(3) (including SU(3) breaking).\nIf any of these predictions fail, penguin annihilation\nand rescattering are ruled out in the U-spin limit or\nfor small U-spin breaking.\nSince the ratio of fT /fL in these pairs of decays\nmeasures SU(3) breaking, an additional test can be\nmade. If one ignores SU(3) breaking, one has the\nfollowing prediction\n(fT /fL )b\u0304\u2192d \u0304 = (fT /fL )b\u0304\u2192s\u0304 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe breaking of SU(3) in the above equation is model\ndependent. If it is found experimentally that the\nabove relation is broken badly, then particular models\nof penguin annihilation and rescattering will have to\ninvent a mechanism to generate large SU(3)-breaking\neffects or they will be ruled out. In other words, Eq. 2\ncan be used to constrain those specific models.\nUp to here, we have not distinguished penguin annihilation and rescattering since their effects are very\nsimilar. We will see now that there is a possible way\nto differentiate them. As noted above, rescattering involves only a change to Pc , while penguin annihilation\ninvolves only Pt . However, the weak phase of these\npieces in b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decays is different: \u03c6(rescattering)\u223c 0,\n\u03c6(penguin annihilation)\u223c \u2212\u03b2. If this weak phase can\nbe measured, one could distinguish penguin annihilation and rescattering. The measurement of that\nphase can be made by performing a time-dependent\nangular analysis of the b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 decay. One has to focus on observables which provide information about\nthe relative phase of the transverse amplitudes in the\ndirect and the CP -conjugated decays (see [15] for\na more detailed discussion). Of the decays pointed\nout as those which satisfy the necessary requirements\nto carry out meaningful tests, there is only one for\nwhich a time-dependent angular analysis can be done:\nBd0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u22170 .\n\n5. B \u2192 V T Decays\nSo far we have been discussing B \u2192 V V decays. In\nthe current section we concentrate on B \u2192 V T processes. As mentioned in the introduction, these decays\n\n\f4\n\nFlavor Physics and CP Violation Conference, Taipei, 2008\nare also analyzed in terms of three polarizations and\nthe fT /fL ratio can be measured.\nThe various explanations must account for the\nfT /fL data in both B \u2192 V1 V2 and B \u2192 V T decays.\nWe examine this question now, both in the SM and\nwith NP.\nWe first briefly review the SM (naive) prediction for\nfT /fL. In the large-energy effective theory [23], it can\nbe shown that the B \u2192 T form factors are expressible\nin terms of two universal quantities. Depending on the\nrelative magnitude of these quantities, three different\nscenarios are possible. It is found that two of them\npredict fT /fL \u226a 1, whereas the other fT /fL \u223c 1.\nHowever, since the last case is in contradiction with\nthe experimental results for B \u2192 \u03c6K2\u2217 (see Table I),\nwe conclude that the SM naively predicts fT /fL \u226a 1\nin B \u2192 V T decays.\nThe next question is: which are the penguin annihilation and rescattering predictions for fT /fL ? In order\nto answer this question, we must establish whether or\nnot the individual explanations depend on the finalstate particles. If they do not, then the prediction\nfor fT /fL in B \u2192 \u03c6K2\u2217 will be the same as that in\nB \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 , which is in disagreement with experiment.\nThe calculation of penguin annihilation does depend\non the final-state wave function. Thus, it is possible that fT /fL is small in B \u2192 \u03c6K2\u2217 for the three\ncases discussed above, in agreement with experiment.\nWithin the rescattering solution, it is again possible\nto choose parameters in order to obtain a small fT /fL\nin B \u2192 \u03c6K2\u2217 . These arguments can be extended to\nany other B \u2192 V T decay. Therefore, since there is\na new set of parameters for each final state, and it is\nvirtually impossible to calculate the values of the parameters, we conclude that both penguin annihilation\nand rescattering are viable, but not very convincing.\nSince the CP measurements in many penguin decays that proceed through b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304 transitions [24] and\nthe polarization measurements in some B \u2192 V1 V2\n(b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304) appear to be in conflict with naive SM expectations decays, it is not unreasonable to attempt\nto understand the data assuming new physics. The\nimportant question to ask is then the following: can\nwe find a unified new-physics explanation for all the\ndiscrepancies so far reported in measurements of purepenguin or penguin-dominated decays? And, what\nwould we expect for B \u2192 V T decays if NP is assumed? After considering a general parametrization\nof NP as in Ref. [10], it appears that the NP scenario\nis the same as that of the SM \u2013 the prediction of fT /fL\nin B \u2192 \u03c6K2\u2217 depends on the values of unknown parameters and with the proper choice it can be made\nconsistent with the experimental results (see [16] for\ndetails). However, the difference is that, with penguin annihilation and rescattering, the parameters are\nessentially incalculable, while the NP prediction depends on form factors. Although the values of these\nform factors are not very well known at the moment,\n\nthey can be calculated. We strongly urge that the\nB \u2192 T form factors be computed. In other decays\nlike B \u2192 \u03c1K2\u2217 , the prediction for fT /fL is the same\nas that of the SM since the NP does not affect these\nprocesses. It will be important to measure the polarization particularly in Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 K2\u22170 and B + \u2192 \u03c10 K2\u2217+\ndecays in order to test the SM and this type of NP.\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe have seen that penguin annihilation and rescattering are two possible SM solutions to the polarization puzzles in B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 and B 0(+) \u2192 \u03c10(+) K \u22170\n(b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304) decays. Both potential explanations also pre \u0304\ndict a large fT /fL ratio in certain B \u2192 V1 V2 (b\u0304 \u2192 d)\nprocesses. We have stressed that if it is found that\nthe transverse polarizations are large in Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 ,\nit may be possible to test these explanations by comparing Bd0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 with B + \u2192 K \u22170 \u03c1+ and see if flavor\nSU(3) is respected. We have examined other b\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304\ndecays related by U-spin to certain b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304 decays.\nTwo promising pairs are: (i) B + \u2192 K \u22170 \u03c1+ (b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304)\n \u0304 and (ii) Bs \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170\nand B + \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u2217+ (b\u0304 \u2192 d)\n \u0304 A large fT /fL\n(b\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304) and Bd0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u22170 (b\u0304 \u2192 d).\nis predicted by penguin annihilation or rescattering in\nthese decays. We have also mentioned that it is possible to distinguish penguin annihilation from rescattering by performing a time-dependent angular analysis\nof Bd0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u22170 . This is difficult experimentally, but\nit may be possible at a future machine.\nFurthermore, we have analyzed the predictions of\nthe SM (naive and extended) and NP in B \u2192 V T\ndecays. The SM naively reproduces the polarization\nmeasurements in B \u2192 \u03c6K2\u2217 and predicts in general\na small fT /fL ratio. The polarization predictions of\nboth penguin annihilation and rescattering are not\ncertain. That is, the predictions depend on a new\nset of parameters for each final state. It is therefore\npossible that both explanations agree with the fT /fL\nmeasurements in B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 and B \u2192 \u03c6K2\u2217 . Finally,\nin Ref. [10] it was found that only two new-physics operators can account for the discrepancies in both the\n\u03c0K data and the \u03c6(\u03c1)K \u2217 polarization measurements.\nWe have mentioned that the prediction of these operators can account for the small fT /fL ratio observed in\nB \u2192 \u03c6K2\u2217 . This prediction can be tested by explicit\ncomputations of the B \u2192 T form factors.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to A. Datta, Y. Gao, A. V. Gritsan,\nD. London and M.
