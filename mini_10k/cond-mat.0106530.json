In a recent work\nit was shown that the relaxation of the thermoremanent\nmagnetization (TRM) exhibits magnetic aging if the field\napplied during cooling is low, but not if a relatively high\nfield is used.10 This result is similar to the behavior of\nspin glasses where large enough fields impose an equilibrium state on experimental time scales and a relaxation\nof the thermoremanent magnetization that is independent of wait time11 and it is thus also consistent with\nthe assumption of collective spin-glass-like dynamics in\nstrongly interacting nanoparticle systems.12 In the spin\nglass case, it has also been shown that field changes can\ninduce rejuvenation of the spin glass state13 and that\nthe nonequilibrium relaxation is affected by large enough\nfields.14,15\nIn this article, we study the effect of bias magnetic\nfields on the nonequilibrium dynamics of a strongly interacting nanoparticle sample. We have chosen to measure the relaxation of the low-frequency ac susceptibility, since such relaxation is indicative of magnetic aging and therefore does not exist in weakly interacting\nnanoparticle systems. It is observed that the collective\nnonequilibrium dynamics disappears at moderate fields\nand that the strength of the field needed to remove the\ncollective glassy dynamics increases with decreasing temperature. The same qualitative behavior is observed for\na spin glass sample. We interpret the results within the\ndroplet model,16 which is a real-space model that has\nsuccessfully been used to describe nonequilibrium effects\nin spin glasses.\nThe ferrofluid consisted of ferromagnetic nanoparticles\nof the amorphous alloy Fe1\u2212x Cx (x \u2248 0.2 \u2212 0.3). A\nTEM study revealed a nearly spherical particle shape\nand a particle size of d = 5.3 \u00b1 0.3 nm. The saturation magnetization is estimated to Ms = 1 * 103 G and\nthe anisotropy constant to K = 9 * 105 erg cm\u22123 . Details\nabout the sample preparation and characterization are\ngiven elsewhere.17 Two samples were studied, one with a\nconcentration of 5 vol% which has earlier been shown to\nexhibit spin-glass-like nonequilibrium dynamics,9 while\n\nThe effect of applied magnetic fields on the collective nonequilibrium dynamics of a strongly interacting Fe-C\nnanoparticle system has been investigated. It is experimentally shown that the magnetic aging diminishes to finally disappear for fields of moderate strength. The field needed to\nremove the observable aging behavior increases with decreasing temperature. The same qualitative behavior is observed\nin an amorphous metallic spin glass (Fe0.15 Ni0.85 )75 P16 B6 Al3 .\n\nFrozen ferrofluids offer systems where the long-range\ndipolar interaction between the single-domain nanoparticles can be continuously varied by changing the particle\nconcentration. In a dilute ferrofluid, where the dipolar interaction energy is negligible compared to the anisotropy\nenergy, the magnetic properties of the system is given\nby averaging over the individual particle contributions.\nThe dynamical properties of isolated particles are determined by the thermally activated relaxation between the\npotential wells of the anisotropy energy, as was originally\nproposed by N\u00e9el.1 The magnetic response of a singledomain particle is strongly affected by an external bias\nfield. The relaxation time depends both on the magnitude and the direction of the applied magnetic field with\nrespect to the anisotropy axis, in combination with the\ndamping of the gyration around the easy axis after a\nspin-flip (see, e.g., Refs. 2\u20135). For interacting particle\nsystems, the dipolar field created by surrounding particles will also affect the relaxation time.6\nHighly concentrated ferrofluids, in which the dipolar\ninteraction energy dominates over the anisotropy energy,\ncontain all ingredients needed to create collective glassy\ndynamics; a complex interaction mechanism - the dipolar interaction - and frustration provided by the randomness of the particle positions and directions of the\nanisotropy axes. Indeed, experiments have shown that\nsuch particle systems exhibit nonequilibrium dynamics\nwith striking similarities to the nonequilibrium dynamics\nof spin glasses. The magnetic relaxation of the low field\ndc magnetization shows an aging behavior7 and there\nis a downward relaxation of the low-frequency ac susceptibility when the sample is kept at constant tempera-\n\n1\n\n\fthe second sample was diluted to 1 vol% and no magnetic aging was observed in this sample.\nFor comparison, experiments were also performed on\nan\namorphous\nmetallic\nspin glass (Fe0.15 Ni0.85 )75 P16 B6 Al3 . The interaction in\nthis sample is of RKKY type and it behaves as a dilute\nmetallic spin glass alloy with a transition temperature of\nTg = 22.5 K. Various magnetic properties of the system\nhave been investigated in a number of earlier reports (see,\ne.g., Refs. 18,19,13,14). We chose this compound since\nit has a high susceptibility and comparably low applied\nmagnetic fields are needed to affect the nonequilibrium\ndynamics.\nThe temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility\nof the two nanoparticle samples with a superimposed dc\nfield was measured in a LakeShore 7225 ac susceptometer\nusing an ac probing field of frequency 125 Hz and amplitude 2 Oe and dc fields in the range 0 \u2013 250 Oe. These\nfields are low enough not to destroy the two-well structure\nof the single-particle potential.20 A noncommercial lowfield SQUID magnetometer21 was used to measure the ac\nsusceptibility with superimposed dc fields as a function\nof time on both the 5 vol% nanoparticle sample and the\nspin glass. The samples were cooled in the dc field from\na temperature in the paramagnetic region to the measuring temperature, and the data collection was initiated\nafter waiting a short time t0 allowing the system to stabilize. For the nano-particle sample t0 = 120 s and for\nthe spin glass t0 = 60 s. The frequency of the ac field\nwas 510 mHz, the field amplitude 10 mOe and the range\nof dc fields 0-240 Oe.\nThe total energy of a nanoparticle system, probed by\nan ac field of amplitude h0 and with an applied dc field\nH in the same direction as the ac field, is given by\nX\n~ dip ) ,\nm\n~ i * (h0 \u1e91 sin \u03c9t + H \u1e91 + H\n(0.1)\nE = Ea \u2212\ni\n\nthe applied field. Corresponding ac susceptibility results\nwith bias fields for the spin glass sample are shown in\nFig. 1 of Ref. 19.\nWe have chosen to study how the collective behavior is\naffected by a magnetic field by measuring the relaxation\nof the low-frequency ac susceptibility in superimposed\ndc fields. Aging effects are seen in \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) as a relaxation\ntowards equilibrium with time spent at constant temperature, t (\u226b 1/\u03c9).22 The corresponding relaxation is seen\nin \u03c7\u2032 (\u03c9), and since the relaxation is larger in \u03c7\u2032 than in\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 it can be more convenient to study \u03c7\u2032 if the relaxation is small.9 Fig. 2 shows \u03c7(H, t) \u2212 \u03c7(H, t = t0 ) for\ndifferent dc fields at T = 25 K for the 5 vol% sample. It\nis seen that the field reduces the relaxation and at fields\nhigher than 200 Oe there is almost no relaxation left. A\nreduction of the relaxation in the ac susceptibility with\napplied magnetic fields is also observed for the spin glass\nsample.\nWe now define a quantity k as\nk(H) =\n\n\u03c7(H, t = t0 ) \u2212 \u03c7(H, t = tmax )\n, (0.3)\n\u03c7(H = 0, t = t0 ) \u2212 \u03c7(H = 0, t = tmax )\n\nwhich gives a relative measure of the relaxation in the\npresence of a dc field. We have repeated the measurements in Fig. 2 at different temperatures for both the 5\nvol% sample and the spin glass sample. For both samples\nthe relaxation persists to higher fields at lower temperatures. Postulating an HT x dependence of k and using\nx as a fitting parameter we obtain reasonable scaling behavior for the two samples. In Fig. 3(a) k(HT 2.5 ) is\nshown for temperatures in the interval 20-35 K, for the 5\nvol% nanoparticle sample. The curves measured at different temperatures give a satisfactory data collapse. For\nthe spin glass sample, on the other hand, data collapse is\nobtained for curves measured at different temperatures\nbetween 16 and 20 K using k(HT 7.5 ), as can be seen in\nFig. 3(b). The choice of using \u03c7\u2032 or \u03c7\u2032\u2032 in the analysis\ndid not affect k.\nWe will interpret our results within the droplet\nmodel16 which was derived for short-range Ising spin\nglasses. Important concepts of the model should however\nalso be applicable to particle systems exhibiting strong\ndipole-dipole interaction and random orientation of the\nanisotropy axes. In this model, it is assumed that, at\neach temperature below the spin-glass transition temperature Tg , the spin-glass equilibrium state is unique but\ntwo-fold degenerate by its global spin-reversal state. In\nequilibrium, the most important contribution to physical\nobservables, such as the magnetic susceptibility, comes\nfrom low-lying excitations of compact clusters of spins,\ncalled droplets. The droplet excitations of size L have a\nbroad distribution of free energies, with a typical value\nof\n\ni\n\nwhere Ea is the anisotropy energy and m\n~ i is the magnetic\nmoment of particle i. The dipolar field at the position of\nthe ith particle is given by\n\"\n#\n1 X 3(m\n~ j * ~rij )~rij\nm\n~j\ndip\n~\nHi =\n\u2212 3\n,\n(0.2)\n5\n4\u03c0 j\nrij\nrij\nwhere j 6= i and ~rij = ~ri \u2212 ~rj is the vector connecting\nparticle i with particle j.\nThe results from measurements of the ac susceptibility with superimposed dc fields for the two nanoparticle\nsamples are shown in Fig. 1. For H = 0 the peak of the\nac susceptibility appears at higher temperature for the\n5 vol% sample than for the 1 vol% sample, due to the\nstronger dipolar interactions in the more concentrated\nsample. However, the difference between the susceptibility of the two samples decreases with increasing dc field,\nand for the highest fields the susceptibility curves are almost identical indicating that the dipolar field created\nby the surrounding particles is negligible compared to\n\nFLtyp \u223c \u03a5(L/L0 )\u03b8 ,\nwhere \u03a5(T ) is the stiffness modulus, \u03b8 is the stiffness\nexponent, and L0 is a characteristic length scale. The\n2\n\n\fgoverned by the relation between the domain size LT (t)\nreached within the experimental time window and the\nlength scale \u03beH set by the magnetic field. In a strong\napplied field Eq. (0.5) can be modified to include the\ncorrelation length, as\n(\n\u0015d\u2212\u03b8 )\n\u0014\nLT (1/\u03c9)\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n.\n\u03c7 (\u03c9, H) = \u03c7eq (\u03c9, H) 1 \u2212 c\nmin(LT (t), \u03beH )\n\nstiffness exponent satisfies \u03b8 \u2264 (d \u2212 1)/2, where d is the\ndimension of the system, and \u03b8 \u2248 0.2 for d = 3.23,24 The\ndynamics of droplets is a thermally activated process.\nThe typical energy barrier scales as\nBLtyp \u223c \u2206(L/L0 )\u03c8 ,\nwhere \u2206(T ) sets the free energy scale of the barriers and\nthe barrier exponent \u03c8 satisfies \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 d \u2212 1. The value\nof the exponent \u03c8 has been estimated to 0.8.25\nLet us now consider the isothermal aging process\nwhich we experimentally have observed as a relaxation of\nthe low-frequency ac susceptibility. Within the droplet\nmodel, the development towards equilibrium from the\nout-of-equilibrium state, which was created when quenching the system, is governed by the growth of domains belonging to either of the two degenerate equilibrium states.\nThat growth is driven by successive nucleation and annihilation of droplets. The growth law proposed by Fisher\nand Huse16 is\n\u0014\n\u00151/\u03c8\nT ln(t/\u03c40 )\nLT (t) \u223c L0\n,\n(0.4)\n\u2206(T )\n\n(0.6)\nHere, it should be noted that neither LT (t) nor \u03beH are\nwell defined length scales, so the relaxation will not end\nabruptly, but will gradually be suppressed over a wide\ntime window. Three different field regimes can be distinguished: i) LT (t) \u226a \u03beH , the collective nonequilibrium dynamics is virtually unaffected by the field. ii)\nLT (t) <\n\u223c \u03beH , the system is partly at equilibrium, and\nhence the ac relaxation is reduced. iii) LT (t) > \u03beH , the\nsystem is in equilibrium, no collective dynamics exists.\nAt sufficiently low temperatures (T <\n\u223c Tg /2) the influence of critical fluctuations is small and hence the temperature dependent coefficients \u03a5, \u2206, and qm are approximately constant.16 Since k(H) scales with LT (t)/\u03beH\naccording to Eq. (0.6), we then expect to obtain data\ncollapse, at low temperatures, plotting k vs HT x\u0303 , with\nx\u0303 = (d \u2212 2\u03b8)/2\u03c8. The reported values of \u03b8 and \u03c8 yield\nx\u0303 > 1 and hence the condition LT (t)/\u03beH \u2248 1 is fulfilled for lower fields at higher temperatures in accordance\nwith results shown in Fig. 3. Due to experimental limitations, the measurements on the spin glass correspond to\nT > Tg /2 and therefore x 6= x\u0303, since critical fluctuations\nwill modify the temperature dependence.\nThe quantitative difference, between the spin glass and\nthe nanoparticle system, in how the field needed to affect the collective dynamics scales with temperature can\nbe attributed to the difference in relaxation time of isolated spins in the two systems. The spin flip time of an\natomic moment in the spin glass is constant, while for\nthe magnetic moment of a nanoparticle the relaxation\ntime depends both on the temperature and the field in a\nnontrivial way, and is also affected by the dipolar interactions.\nWe have shown, by measuring the isothermal relaxation of the ac susceptibility with superimposed dc fields,\nthat the collective glassy dynamics of a strongly interacting nanoparticle system can be destroyed by the application of moderate fields. The field strength needed to\ndestroy the collective dynamics increases with decreasing temperature. This behavior is consistent with corresponding observations on a spin glass sample. The results for both samples show quantitative agreement with\npredictions within the droplet model.\n\nwhere \u03c40 is the relaxation time of a spin (or magnetic\nmoment). The weak ac field of frequency \u03c9/2\u03c0 probes\nthe system by polarizing droplets of size LT (1/\u03c9). Since\nt \u226b 1/\u03c9, LT (1/\u03c9) < LT (t) and hence the domain walls of\nsize LT (t) appear effectively frozen on the probing length\nscale. The small scale droplets [of size LT (1/\u03c9)] in touch\nwith a frozen-in domain wall will have a lower free energy\nthan they would have had if the frozen-in wall was not\npresent. This can be described by a reduction of the\neffective stiffness of the system. Fisher and Huse used\nscaling arguments to obtain\n\u0015d\u2212\u03b8\n\u0014\n\u2206\u03a5\nLT (1/\u03c9)\n\u223c\n\u03a5\nLT (t)\nand deduced that\n(\n\n\u0014\n\nLT (1/\u03c9)\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) = \u03c7\u2032\u2032eq (\u03c9) 1 \u2212 c\nLT (t)\n\n\u0015d\u2212\u03b8 )\n\n,\n\n(0.5)\n\nwhere c is a constant. It has been shown experimentally,\nfor a 2d Ising spin glass, that both \u03c7\u2032\u2032 and \u03c7\u2032 relax according to this expression.26\nIn a magnetic field H, the system is disordered by the\nfield on length scales larger than the correlation length\n\u03beH \u223c\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03a5\n\u221a\nH qm\n\n\u00152/(d\u22122\u03b8)\n\n,\n\nwhile it still exhibits spin glass order on shorter length\nscales. Here, qm (T ) is an order parameter defined in\nRef. 16. The typical time needed for the system to equi\u03c8\nlibrate is given by teq \u223c \u03c4H , where ln(\u03c4H /\u03c40 ) \u223c \u2206\nT \u03beH .\nThe relaxation of \u03c7 at a certain temperature will then be\n3\n\n\f26\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank J.
