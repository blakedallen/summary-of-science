Kortus\n\n7\n6\n\nIn a recent Letter [1] the authors claim that the observed decrease of Tc in Al and C doped MgB2 samples\nis mainly due to the band filling by the electron doping\nbut for a fuller understanding of the different behavior\nof the superconducting energy gaps in Al and C doped\nsamples it is necessary to also include an increased interband scattering for the carbon doped samples. We argue\nin the following that this latter statement is misleading\nand is based on the assumption that for carbon doping\nthe two superconducting gaps merge near 10 % carbon\ndoping: an assumption that contradicts most of the existing experimental data. A great deal of experimental\neffort has been invested into the measurements of the\nsuperconducting gaps of 10 % C doped MgB2 samples.\nThe thermodynamic measurements of the specific heat in\nthat case clearly show the large gap feature and provides\nstrong suggestions of the small gap [2]. The tunneling\nmeasurements [3,4] very nicely do exactly the opposite:\ni.e. clearly show the smaller gap and provide strong indication of the larger gap. Later work, Holanova et al.\nhas even shown the presence of both gaps in a single experiment (see Fig. 2 of Ref. [5]). The theory presented\nby Kortus et al. shows the two gaps merging for Tc values very close to that of the 10 % sample: a prediction\nthat is strongly inconsistent with these data. The problem with assuming that the two superconducting gaps\nmerge near 10 % carbon doping is even more starkly illustrated by an examination of the systematic change in\ngap values with carbon substitution. Fig. 1 presents\nthe systematics of the available data on the behavior of\nthe superconducting energy gaps upon carbon doping in\nthe magnesium diboride. The solid symbols are from the\npoint-contact tunneling measurements by Holanova et al.\n[5,6] and Schmidt et al. [4] and also from the recent photoemission spectroscopy by Tsuda et al. [7]. The open\ndiamonds represent the gap values obtained by Gonnelli\net al. [8] from the treatment of their point-contact spectroscopy measurements. All data, with the exception of\nthose from Gonnelli et al., are fully compatible with the\ntheoretical model including only the band filling effects.\nIn this case, the increasing carbon doping leads to a decrease of Tc as well as to a proportional decrease of the\nboth superconducting gaps (dashed lines). The dotted\ncurve is the theoretical prediction of Kortus et al., where\nbeside the band filling an additional increase in interband\nscattering \u03b3inter = 2000xcm\u22121 is considered. This latter\neffect increases the value of the small gap and together\nwith the band filling leads to the indicated merging of the\ntwo gaps. Without any detailed analysis of the original\ndata of the four groups, the conclusion can be made that\nfor the large gap there is a perfect consensus among all\npresented measurements. As far as the small gap is concerned the mean values obtained by Gonnelli et al. are\npositioned at higher energies than in another sets of mea-\n\n5\n\n\u2206 (meV)\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0503153v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] 7 Mar 2005\n\nComment on: \"Band Filling and Interband\nScattering Effects in MgB2 : Carbon versus Aluminium Doping\"\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nTc (K)\n\nFIG. 1.

The single gap seen by Gonnelli et al. on the\nsample with 13.2 per cent of carbon doped in MgB2 and\nTc of 18.9 K is the central point on which the theoretical\ntreatment of Kortus et al. is based [9], but ommiting all\nother experimental evidence available. The theoretical\ncalculations of Erwin and Mazin [10] have shown that replacement of boron by carbon does not change the local\npoint symmetry. In this case, the interband scattering\nshould remain as small, as in the undoped MgB2 and\nthe two superconducting energy gaps should not be expected to merge, as indeed they do not ( [3\u20137]). In the\nmeasurements [5\u20137] the carbon doped samples of different forms (wires, sintered pellets, polycrystals) prepared\nby different methods were used. Nevertheless, the presence of the two superconducting energy gaps and their\nconsistent evolution with Tc without merging has been\nfound directly in the raw data up to the highest carbon\nconcentrations.
