One of the unsolved\nproblems of AGN feedback in clusters is the issue of morphology and stability of buoyant bubbles inflated by AGN\nand the efficiency of their mixing with the surrounding ICM.\nIt is important to understand the process of bubble fragmentation and its eventual mixing with the rest of the ICM in\norder to quantify mass deposition and star formation rates\nin cool cores clusters. In the best-studied case of the Perseus\ncluster (Fabian et al. 2006) observations indicate that such\nbubbles can remain stable even far from cluster centers\nwhere they were created (see cup-shaped feature northwest\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: mr@mpa-garching.mpg.de (MR)\n\nof the center of the cluster or a similar yet tentative feature to the south in their Figure 3). One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the intracluster medium is\nviscous and that viscosity suppresses Rayleigh-Taylor and\nKelvin-Helmholz instabilities on their surfaces. Reynolds et\nal. (2005) performed a series of numerical experiments, compared inviscid and viscous cases and quantified how much\nviscosity is needed to prevent bubble disruption. For viscosity at the level of 25% of the Braginskii value they obtained results consistent with observations. The same problem has been considered analytically by Kaiser et al. (2005)\nwho computed the instability growth rate as a function of\nscale and viscosity coefficient. An alternative possibility is\nthat bubbles are made more stable by significant deceleration during their initial evolution (Pizzolato & Soker 2006).\nThe \"viscous solution\" is very appealing as it also addresses\n\n\f2\n\nM. Ruszkowski et al.\n\nthe issue of dissipation of sound waves, weak shocks as well\nas g\u2212modes (Fabian et al. 2003a). However, it is not entirely\nclear what the level and nature of viscosity in the ICM really is. This is because the ICM and the bubbles themselves\nare known to be magnetized and magnetic fields may reduce\ntransport processes (but see Lazarian 2006 and Schekochihin & Cowley 2006). Although magnetic fields in clusters\nare known to have plasma \u03b2 > 1, (\u03b2 \u2261 Pgas /(B 2 /2\u03bco ); e.g.,\nBlanton et al. 2003) they may in principle have a strong\neffect on suppressing Kelvin-Helmholz and Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstabilities. Jones & De Young (2005) considered the evolution of bubbles in a magnetized ICM by performing twodimensional numerical MHD simulations and found that\nbubbles could be prevented from shredding even when \u03b2 is as\nhigh as \u223c 120. A somewhat different conclusion was reached\nby Robinson et al. (2004) who simulated magnetized bubbles\nwith the FLASH code (Fryxell et al. 2000) in two dimensions\nand found out that a dynamically important magnetic field\n(\u03b2 < 1) is required to maintain bubble integrity. Both of\nthe above-mentioned simulations were performed in 2D and\nfor very idealized magnetic field configurations such as, for\nexample, doughnut-shaped fields with symmetry axis parallel to the direction of motion. Recently, Nakamura, Li, & Li\n(2006) considered the stability of Poyinting-flux dominated\njets in cluster environment. Here we focus on a later stage\nin the outflow evolution and consider physically-motivated\nmagnetic field case of \u03b2 > 1 and more realistic (stochastically tangled) field configurations in fossil bubbles (i.e., after the transition from the momentum-driven to buoyancydriven stage) than in previous buoyant stage MHD simulations. We show that only when the power spectrum cutoff\nof magnetic field fluctuations is larger than the bubble size\ncan the bubble shredding be suppressed. It is possible that\nsuch \"draping\" case is not representative of typical cool core\nfields (Vogt & Ensslin 2005) and, if so, other mechanism, such\nas viscosity, would be required to keep the bubbles stable.\nHowever, Vogt & Ensslin (2005) estimated magnetic power\nspectra in Hydra A only which shows extraordinarily strong\nAGN outbursts. We also note that such Faraday rotation observations of radio lobes are only weakly sensitive to large\nscale magnetic fields aligned with the bubble surface and\nrely on certain untested assumptions. Therefore, we argue\nthat the draping case may be a viable solution to the problem of bubble stability.\nIn Section 2 we present the simulation setup and the\njustification for the parameter choices. Section 3 presents\nresults and Section 4 our conclusions. The Appendix discusses in detail our method of setting up initial magnetic\nfield configurations.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSIMULATION DETAILS\nThe code\n\nThe simulations were performed with the PENCIL code.\n(Dobler et al. 2003, Haugen et al. 2003, Brandenburg et\nal. 2004, Haugen et al. 2004) Although PENCIL is nonconservative, it is a highly accurate grid code that is sixth\norder in space and third order in time. It is particularly\nsuited for weakly compressible turbulent MHD flows. Magnetic fields are implemented in terms of a vector potential\n\nso the field remains solenoidal throughout simulation (i.e.,\nno divergence cleaning of the magnetic field is necessary).\nThe code is memory efficient, uses Message-Passing Interface and is highly parallel. The PENCIL code is better suited\nfor the simulations of stability of magnetized bubbles than\nsmoothed particle magneto-hydrodynamical codes as it can\nbetter capture certain aspects of the bubble (magnetohydro) dynamics, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, even\nfor high density contrasts. and suffers less from numerical\ndiffusion of the magnetic field. Although no formal code\ncomparison has been made, other well known MHD mesh\ncodes, such as FLASH or ZEUS, likely require comparatively\nhigher resolution to achieve the same level of magnetic flux\nconservation as the PENCIL code.\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nInitial conditions\nDensity and temperature profiles\n\nThe cluster gas was assumed to be isothermal with temperature equal to 10 keV (this temperature was used to minimize\nthe ratio of code viscosity to the Braginskii value; see Section\n2.2.4 for more explanation). The gas was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium and subject to gravitational acceleration\ngiven by a sum of two isothermal potentials\ng(r) = \u2212\n\n2\u03c3a2\n2\u03c3b2\n\u2212\n,\n(r + ra )\n(r + rb )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c3a = 1.41, \u03c3b = 2.69, ra = 30.0 and rb = 5.0 in code\nunits (see below) were the parameters were chosen to give\na pressure profile consistent with that observed in clusters.\nCentral gas density was 10\u221225 g cm\u22123 (i.e., about 5.2 \u00d7 10\u22122\nelectrons per cm\u22123 ). Self-gravity of the gas was neglected.\nThe profiles of pressure and temperature are shown in Figure 1. We consider ideal gas with adiabatic equation of state\nwith \u03b3 = 5/3. The bubbles were underdense by a factor of\nten with respect to the local ICM and its temperature was\nincreased by the same factor to keep it in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding gas. The remaining bubble parameters are mentioned in section 2.2.4 where we discuss\ncode units. The pressure in the ICM changes significantly\nover the height of the bubble. It is for this reason that we\nmodified the density and temperature on a \"point-by-point\"\nbasis. That is, at every location within the bubble, we increased the temperature by a constant factor and decreased\nthe density by the same factor while keeping the pressure\nat the same level as the pressure at the same distance from\nthe cluster center away from the bubble. This way, the initial\npressure distribution is smooth and there is no strong departure from perfect equilibrium. Although the density contrast\nof the bubble is relatively low, this has minimal effect on\nour results. This is because the buoyancy velocity is proportional to (1 \u2212 \u03c1bubble/\u03c1icm )1/2 which is insensitive to \u03c1bubble\nas long as it is much smaller than \u03c1icm . The reason we opted\nfor such relatively low density contrast is numerical: higher\nbubble temperatures would have required smaller timesteps\nto achieve numerical stability. We also note that some real\nbubbles may have smaller density contrasts. A well-known\nextreme example is the Virgo cluster where buoyant bubbles\nin the radio show very little corresponding structure in the\nX-ray maps.\n\n\fImpact of tangled magnetic fields on AGN-blown bubbles\n2.2.2\n\nMagnetic fields\n\nWe consider magnetic fields inside the bubbles and in the\nICM that are dynamically unimportant in the sense that\ntheir plasma \u03b2 parameter is greater than unity. That is,\nmagnetic pressure may become important when compared\nto the bubble ram pressure associated with the gas motions\nin the ICM but it is generally small compared to the\npressure of the ICM in our simulations. Analysis of cluster\nbubbles by Dunn et al. suggest that \u03b2 \u22121 is roughly in\nthe range (10\u22123 , 0.3) with the mean h\u03b2 \u22121 i = 0.06 and\nmedian of 0.03 (see sample of Dunn et al. 2004, Dunn et al.\n2005 and Dunn 2006, Dunn priv. communication). Other\nevidence for high \u03b2 comes from observations of Faraday\nrotation measure and the lack of Faraday depolarization in\nbright X-ray shells in Abell 2052 as observed by Blanton et\nal. (2003). They infer \u03b2 \u223c 30. These arguments motivated\nus to consider high \u03b2 cases. However, we note that low-\u03b2\nis not ruled out beyond reasonable doubt by the above\nobservations and theoretical considerations and, thus, its\nconsequences for bubble dynamics should be investigated\nfurther.\nRegarding the geometry of magnetic fields, we consider\nrandom isotropic fields with coherence length smaller than\nthe bubble sizes (hereafter termed \"random\"), isotropic\nhelical fields with coherence length smaller then the\nR bubble\nsize (termed \"helical\" below; helicity is defined as A*BdV ,\nwhere A and B are vector potential and magnetic field\nrespectively), and the \"draping\" case of isotropic fields\ncharacterized by coherence length exceeding bubble size as\nwell as a non-magnetic case.\nMagnetic draping has been considered previously in\nthe context of merging cluster cores and radio bubbles using\nanalytical approach by Lyutikov (2006). He found that\neven when magnetic fields are dynamically unimportant\nthroughout the ICM, thin layer of dynamically important\nfields can form around merging dense substructure clumps\n(\"bullets\") and prevent their disruption. We suggest that,\ndepending on the unknown value of magnetic diffusivity,\nthere may be some relic magnetic power spectrum with\na smaller amplitude than the freshly injected one (either\nby AGN bubbles or dynamo-driven) that extends to scales\nlarger than the bubble size and that provides draping fields\nto stabilize the bubbles.\nThe helical case is motivated by the fact that magnetic\nhelicity is conserved for ideal MHD case. Moreover, helicity\nis proportional to the product of magnetic energy and typical lengthscale and, thus, fragmentation is not energetically\npreferred in the sense that it would lead to local increase\nof magnetic energy. Another justification for helical fields\nis that they may be responsible for explaining circular\npolarization of certain radio sources, and especially its sign\npersistency (Ensslin 2003 but see Ruszkowski & Begelman\n2002). It is conceivable that magnetic helicity that could\nproduce such signal in jets could survive till the buoyant\nstage.\nThe \"random\" case is motivated by the work of Vogt\n& Ensslin (2005) who estimate power spectrum of magnetic\nfield fluctuations in Hydra A from Faraday rotation maps.\nWe are conservative in our choice of parameters in the sense\nthat we use fields of somewhat higher coherence length that\n\n3\n\nare more likely to stabilize bubbles.\n\n2.2.3\n\nVector potential setup\n\nIn setting up initial magnetic field configuration we ensured\nthat the following conditions are met:\n\u2022 magnetic fields must be divergence-free\n\u2022 bubble and environmental fields must be isolated, i.e.,\nno magnetic field lines should penetrate the surface of the\nbubble\n\u2022 magnetic fields must be characterized by the required\npower spectra\n\u2022 when necessary, magnetic helicity may be imposed\n\u2022 magnetic plasma \u03b2 parameter of the bubble and the\nICM must be independently controllable\n\u2022 all considered field configurations must result (after\nsuitable modifications) from the same white noise Gaussian\nrandom numbers. This ensures that the differences in evolution are entirely due to model parameters and not due to\ndifferent random realizations.\nThe details of the algorithm used to set up the initial\nmagnetic field configuration is presented in the Appendix..\n\n2.2.4\n\nCode units and resolution\n\nWe consider the the following code units: one length unit\ncorresponds to 1 kpc, one velocity unit to 3\u00d7107 cm/s and\none density unit to 10\u221224 g/cm3 . This corresponds to one\ntime unit of approximately 3.3\u00d7106 years. The box size is\n100 code length units on a side and shock-absorbing boundary conditions were used. This choice of boundary conditions was dictated by the fact that we wanted to exclude the\nRichmyer-Meshkov instability due to reflected waves passing\nthrough the bubble as a potential destabilizing mechanism.\nThe bubble size was d = 25 in diameter and its center was\noffset by 20 code length units from the cluster origin. The\nbubble was underdense by a factor of ten with respect to\nthe local ICM and its temperature was increased by the\nsame factor to keep it in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding gas. Our grid size is 2003 zones. The PENCIL code\nrequires some viscosity and resistivity to run properly. Minimum required amount of physical viscosity that the code\nneeds to prevent numerical instabilities from developing decreases as the numerical resolution is increased. We use viscosity \u03bd = 0.07 and magnetic resistivity \u03b7 = 0.07. For typical\nvalues of electron density (\u223c 0.01 cm\u22123 ) and temperature\n(10 keV) in our simulations this value of viscosity corresponds to 0.014 of the Braginskii value. We note that for\nlower gas temperatures this ratio would be higher which\nmotivated our choice of temperature. For the parameters\nconsidered here, in the initial stages in our simulations, maximum velocities in code units are roughly umax \u223c 6. Note\nthat for the adopted parameters the sound speed in the ICM\nis cs = 5.44 but the gas inside the bubbles is much hotter and\nso the actual gas velocities can be higher then umax without\n\"violating\" the sound speed limit. For the bubble size d = 25\nand gas velocity umax = 6.0, hydrodynamical and magnetic\nReynolds numbers are roughly Re = umax d/\u03bd \u223c 2000. Such\n\n\f4\n\nM. Ruszkowski et al.\n\nFigure 1. Initial pressure (solid line) and temperature profiles.\n\nFigure 2. One dimensional energy power spectra of initial magnetic field fluctuations. Solid line shows energy spectrum corresponding to our \"draping\". Dashed line is for the \"random\" case.\n\nvalues clearly lead to quick development of Rayleigh-Taylor\nand Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities for unmagnetized bubbles.\n\n3\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn Figure 4 we show the evolution of the gas density. Each\ncolumn corresponds to one model. Time increases from bottom to top. Snapshots were taken at 15, 25, 35 code time\nunits. The following five models were considered (from left\nto right):\n\u2022 draping model: mean \u03b2 \u223c 40 throughout the box (i.e.,\nrelative plasma \u03b2 of the bubble with respect to the ICM is\nset to unity)\n\u2022 random (i) model: constant mean \u03b2 throughout the box.\nThe initial mean \u03b2 was chosen so as to match mean \u03b2 values\nnear t = 15 code time units in the draping case\n\u2022 random (ii) model : initial bubble-averaged beta inside\nthe bubble the same as the mean initial \u03b2 in case random\n(i) Relative magnetic pressure inside the bubble was chosen\n\nFigure 3. Magnetic pressure in the plane containing the cluster and bubble centers. Upper and lower panels show \"draping\"\nand \"random\" cases, respectively. The coherence length in the\nlower panel is even smaller than that used in the simulations to\ndemonstrate the robustness of the method. See Appendix for more\nexplanation.\n\nto be 10 times higher than the typical ambient magnetic\npressure\n\u2022 helical case: same as random (ii) but for helical fields\n\u2022 non-magnetic case.\nIt is evident that the bubble morphology depends\nstrongly on the topology of the initial magnetic field. There\nis a striking difference between draping case (first column)\nand all remaining cases. Even though magnetic fields are\n\"dynamically\" unimportant in the sense that the typical\nplasma \u03b2 parameter is much greater than unity, the bubble clearly is more coherent in the draping case than in any\nother case. The cup-shaped morphology in the draping case\nin the first snapshot at 15 time units is very reminiscent of\nthe fossil bubble seen in the Perseus cluster. As the bubble\nmoves up, its shape changes and it becomes more round.\nThe Rayleigh-Taylor instability is prevented and so there is\nno evidence for strong contamination or mixing of the bubble interior with the colder ICM material. However, denser\nand colder material lifted by the rising bubble reverses its\n\n\fImpact of tangled magnetic fields on AGN-blown bubbles\n\n5\n\nFigure 4. Natural logarithm of density in the cluster. Columns show time sequences of density for draping, random (i), random (ii),\nhelical and non-magnetic cases from left column to the right, respectively. Rows correspond to time of 15.0, 25.0, 35.0 code time units\nfrom bottom to top. Sides of all boxes show densities in the planes intersecting the box and containing its center.\n\nmotion at a certain time and begins to fall back. This leads\nto some stretching of the bubble in the vertical direction in\nthe later stages in its evolution.\nThe second column shows random (i) case. Here the gas\nbehind the bubble quickly penetrates its center and tends\nto pierce through it. This is evident especially when the left\nhand sides of the cubes in the first and second column are\ncompared. The working surface of the bubble becomes irregular and starts to fragment. Similar behavior is observed in\nthe random (ii) case (third column). The two cases differ in\nthe strength of magnetic field with case (ii) having stronger\ninternal bubble fields but weaker ICM ones. Nevertheless,\nthere does not seem to be much qualitative difference between these two cases in terms of density distribution.\nThe fourth column shows the helical case. The degree of\nbubble fragmentation is lower than in the random cases even\nthough typical magnetic field strength is similar to that of\nrandom (i) case. Although this appears to be a weak effect,\nas explained in Section 2.2.2, helicity conservation should\ntend to stabilize the flow. This column should be compared\nmainly with the third column that shows its non-helical analog.\nThe last column shows the non-magnetic case. Both\nRayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholz instabilities develop\nhere very quickly. The bubble is pierced by a column of cold\ngas forming a \"smoke ring\" rather then cup-shaped or oval\nstructure as in the draping case. The edges of this ring are\ninitially wrinkled by Kelvin-Helmholz instability.\nIn Figure 5 we show the distribution of magnetic pressure. As in Figure 4, columns correspond to different models and are ordered the same way while rows correspond\n\nto 15, 25, 35 time units from bottom to top. This figure\nreveals that the reason for bubble stability in the draping\ncase (first column) is the formation of an \"umbrella\" or a\nthin protective magnetic layer on the bubble working surface\nthat suppresses instabilities. Visual inspection of the figure\ncomparing magnetic pressure evolution in the draping, two\nrandom, and helical cases shows that the field geometry does\nnot change significantly (in the average sense) far away from\nthe bubbles. The upward motion of the bubble also leads to\nsubstantial amplification and ordering of magnetic field in\nthe bubble wake. This has consequences for estimates of conduction in the ICM based on the appearance of H\u03b1 filaments\n(Fabian et al. 2003b, Hatch et al. 2006). It has been argued\n(e.g., Nipoti & Binney 2004) that thermal conduction has\nto be strongly suppressed in the ICM or otherwise such cold\nfilaments would be rapidly evaporated. Our result hints at a\npossibility that thermal conduction may be locally weaker in\nthe bubble wake, thus preventing or slowing down filament\nevaporation.\nThe second column shows random (i) case. No \"umbrella\" effect seen in the draping case is observed here. The\nfact that the colder gas enters the bubble from beneath does\nnot lead to compression of magnetic field in the direction\nparallel to the bubble surface, an effect that could prevent\ndisruption. Even though the bubble does get disrupted, some\ncompression and ordering of magnetic field in the wake occurs here just as in the draping case. In fact, this effect is a\ngeneric feature of all the runs that we performed. The behavior of magnetic pressure in random (ii) case, shown in\nthe third column, is qualitatively very similar with the difference that the magnetic wakes are more pronounced. Even\n\n\f6\n\nM. Ruszkowski et al.\n\nFigure 5. Magnetic pressure structure in the cluster. Columns show time sequences of magnetic pressure for draping, random (i), random\n(ii) and helical cases from left column to the right, respectively. Rows correspond to time of 0.0, 15.0, 25.0, 35.0 code time units from\nbottom to top.\n\nthough magnetic fields get marginally compressed near the\nbubble working surface in this case, they remain disjoint and\ndo not prevent the shredding of the bubble.\nThe last column shows magnetic pressure in the helical\ncase. There is a significant difference in the topology of the\nfield inside the bubble between this and all previous cases.\nHere, the upward drift of the bubble appears to amplify magnetic field inside the bubble. Note that while in the draping\ncase amplification took place in a thin layer coinciding with\nthe working surface of the bubble, the amplification in the\nhelical case is distributed throughout the bubble. This is\nparticularly obvious in the snapshot taken at 15 code time\nunits. We note that this means that moderate stabilizing\neffect of helicity comes from fields internal to the bubble\nrather than external ones as in the draping case. No obvious\namplification inside the bubble is seen in the random cases\nother than the \"wake\" amplification.\nIn Figure 6 we show X-ray maps. The columns are arranged the same way as in Figure 4. Rows from 1 to 3 correspond to different projection direction than rows 4 to 6\n(the latter ones correspond to the viewing direction rotated\nby 90 degrees around the axis intersecting the cluster center\nand the original location of the bubble). As expected, the\nmorphology in the draping case is very different than in all\nother cases. In this case the bubbles show up as depressions\nin X-ray emissivity. The bubbles in the random case appear\n\nirregular. They are also brighter in their centers which is\ncontrary to observations. In the helical case, the bubbles\nseem somewhat less disturbed than in the random case. It is\npossible that this case, when \"observed\" in synthetic Chandra data that includes instrument responses would resemble\nactual bubbles more than the random case bubbles. The last\ncolumn shows the non-magnetic case that is clearly inconsistent with observations. Here the bubble more resembles two\nisolated bubbles than a coherent feature seen in the draping\ncase. We suggest that a hybrid model that combines internal helical magnetic fields inside the bubble with external\ndraping fields may produce X-ray bubbles that closely resemble bubbles seen in clusters. However, different method\nfor setting up initial conditions than the one considered here\nwould have to be employed to model such a case while ensuring that the initial magnetic field configuration does not\nsuffer from any artifacts.\nWe note that the magnetic fields in our simulations\nare observed to decay with time. The decay is expected\nas, apart from the bubble-induced motion, the turbulence\nis not continuously driven in our simulations. As expected,\nthe decay is faster for more tangled fields. Even though\nthe field decays, we note that disruption (when present) is\ninitiated early on in the bubble evolution. Moreover, our\nfield strengths are greater than those in Jones & De Young\n(2005) uniform field case and yet we do observe disruption.\n\n\fImpact of tangled magnetic fields on AGN-blown bubbles\n\n7\n\nFigure 6. X-ray images of the cluster center. Columns show time sequences of X-ray emission for draping, random (i), random (ii)\nhelical, and non-magnetic cases from left column to the right, respectively. Rows correspond to time of 15.0, 25.0, 35.0 code time units\nfrom bottom to top. Rows 1 to 3 correspond to a different projection axis than rows 4 to 6.\n\nWe quantified the decay in magnetic pressure for the cases\nwhere the mean bubble and ICM \u03b2 parameters are the same\n(\"draping\" and random (i) cases). In Figure 10 we show the\nevolution of the mean magnetic pressure compared to gas\npressure in the plane intersecting the cluster center and the\n\noriginal bubble location. We found that, while the \"random\"\ncase shows the decay, the \"draping\" case is consistent with\nno decay. By construction, the mean fields in the draping\ncase and random (i) one approximately match at t = 15 code\ntime units. The decay of the field after this time is rather\n\n\f8\n\nM. Ruszkowski et al.\n\nFigure 7. Natural logarithm of density distribution. Left column shows density for the random (i) case (lower panel t=15, upper t = 25\ncode time units) but twice as high mean magnetic pressure. Right column corresponds to the draping case for twice the mean magnetic\npressure compared to the original draping case.\n\nslow and magnetic field strengths in the random and draping cases are comparable around and after this time. Prior\nto t = 15 the field in the random case exceeds that in the\ndraping case. It is interesting that, even though this is the\ncase, the random case fields lead to bubble disruption while\nthe draping case shows much more coherent structures. This\ndemonstrates that the difference between this two cases is\nprimarily due to the field geometry and not its strength, at\nleast for the typical plasma \u03b2 considered here. Moreover, if\nwe would have considered driven turbulence then we could\nhave afforded to start from weaker fields in the random case\nand additional random motions due to turbulence driving\nwould be present. Both of these effects (i.e., weaker initial\nfield in conjunction with additional random motions) could\nonly strengthen our conclusion, i.e., make the random case\nbubbles fragment even more easily. We are thus conservative in neglecting turbulence driving. We also note that our\naim was not to address the stability of the bubbles exposed\nto random motions. Our objective was to discuss the effect\nof tangled magnetic fields on the development of RayleighTaylor and Kelvin-Helmholz instabilities. Random motions,\nbe it due to turbulence driving or due to post-merger re-\n\nlaxation, are inevitably going to be present in cool cluster\ncores (even though cool cores tend to be more relaxed than\nthe centers of non-cooling flow clusters). Their impact has\nto be evaluated in evaluated in sepatate studies. Another\nunknown factor is how magnetic fields are driven inside the\ncavities (if at all). However, including such effects would be\nbeyond the scope of our investigation.\n\n3.1\n\nVarying magnetic pressure\n\nWe simulated draping and random case (i) again for exactly the same parameters as before except for twice as high\nmean magnetic pressures in both cases. We observe the same\ntrends with the difference that the draping case results in\nslightly more coherent bubbles while the random case in\nslightly more fragmented ones. This strengthens our arguments presented above that it is the geometry of the field\nrather than its strength that is responsible for stabilizing\nthe bubbles (at least for the parameters considered here).\nIn Figures 7, 8, and 9 we show density, magnetic pressure\nand X-ray emissivity, respectively. Note that the \"umbrella\"\neffect mentioned above is clearly seen in the draping case in\n\n\fImpact of tangled magnetic fields on AGN-blown bubbles\n\n9\n\nFigure 8. Same as Figure 7 but for the logarithm of magnetic pressure distribution. Note that in the draping case (right panel), a layer\nof ordered and amplified magnetic field forms on the bubble-ICM interface and protects the bubble against disruption.\n\nthe left column in Figure 8. This is to be contrasted with\nthe left hand panel corresponding to the high magnetic version of the random (i) case where no such effect is observed.\nLower panel in Figure 10 shows the evolution of the mean\nmagnetic pressure compared to the gas pressure in the plane\ncontaining the center of the cluster and the initial position\nof the bubble.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe considered three-dimensional MHD simulations of buoyant bubbles in cluster atmospheres for varying magnetic field\nstrengths characterized by plasma \u03b2 > 1 and for varying\nfield topologies. We find that field topology plays a key role\nin controlling the mixing of bubbles with the surrounding\nICM. We show that large scale external fields are more likely\nto stabilize bubbles than internal ones but a moderate stabilizing effect due to magnetic helicity can make internal\nfields play a role too. We demonstrate that bubble morphology closely resembling fossil bubbles in the Perseus cluster\ncould be realized if the coherence of magnetic field is greater\nthan the typical bubble size. While it is not clear if such a\n\"draping\" case is representative of typical cluster fields, Vogt\n\n& Ensslin (2005) find that length scale of magnetic fields in\nHydra A is smaller than typical bubble size. If this also holds\ntrue in other clusters then other mechanisms, such as viscosity, would be required to keep the bubbles stable. Unfortunately, Faraday rotation method used by Vogt & Ensslin\n(2005) is not very sensitive to large scale magnetic fields if\naligned with the bubble surface. Moreover, their maximum\nLikelihood method assumes a power-law relation between\nmagnetic field and density, statistical isotropy for the purpose of deprojection and a particular jet angle with respect\nto the line-of-sight. Smaller angles and different magnetic\nfield configurations might yield a weaker decline of the power\nspectrum at larger scales. Taking into account the above limitations, it is entirely possible that the draping case offers a\nviable alternative solution to the problem of bubble stability.\nWe also suggest that a hybrid model that combines helical\nfields inside the bubble with external draping fields could\nbe successful in explaining morphologies of X-ray bubbles\nin clusters. Another possibility is that dynamically significant fields are be present inside the bubbles and the consequences of high-\u03b2 case for bubble dynamics and stability\nshould be investigated further. We note that the bubbles\nwill most likely eventually get disrupted (partially helped\n\n\f10\n\nM. Ruszkowski et al.\n\nFigure 9. X-ray maps corresponding to Figures 8 and 9. Projection orientation is the same as in the upper panels in Figure 6.\n\nby \"cosmological\" sloshing gas motions in clusters).\nA generic feature found in our simulations is the formation of a magnetic wake where fields are ordered and amplified. We suggest that this effect could prevent evaporation\nby thermal conduction of cold H\u03b1 filaments observed in the\nPerseus cluster.\nThe physical process of bubble mixing in the presence\nof magnetic fields has important consequences also for modeling of mass deposition and star formation rates in cool\ncore clusters as well as the particle content of bubbles and\ncosmic ray diffusion from them. These issues will be further complicated by the effects of anisotropy of transport\nprocesses due to magnetic fields. This may give rise to the\nonset of magneto-thermal instability on the bubble-ICM interface (Balbus 2004, Parrish & Stone 2005). Studying such\neffects is beyond the scope of the present paper but certainly\ndeserves further investigation.\n\n5\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank the referee for a detailed and insightful report.\nMR thanks Axel Brandenburg, Kandu Subramanian, Maxim\n\nLyutikov, Eugene Churazov, Debora Sijacki, Jonathan\nDursi, Maxim Markevitch, Alexei Vikhlinin and Alexander\nSchekochihin for helpful discussions.

Note that both the field just inside\nand outside the bubble are acted upon by this operator.\nApplying this operator results in a field that possesses some\ndivergence.\n(4) changing relative magnetic pressure inside the bubble (done only during the first loop of the iteration process)\nPlasma \u03b2 parameter is given by \u03b2(r) = \u03b2rel gb (r) + 1 \u2212 gr (r),\nwhere \u03b2rel is the relative plasma \u03b2 parameter between the\nICM and the bubble. The gb (r) term is given by gb (r) =\n1 + cos[0.5\u03c0(x + \u2206b x \u2212 1)/\u2206b x], where x = r/rbub for\n1 < x < 1 + \u2206b x and g(r) = 0 otherwise. In the above\nexpression, rbub is the bubble radius and \u2206b x = 0.15.\n(5) computing the FFT of B(r) and going back to (1).\nIterations are performed\nuntil the Rfollowing convergence\nR\ncriterion is met: (\u2207 * B(r))2 dV dx2 / B 2 dV < 10\u22124 , where\nintegrations are performed for |x \u2212 1| < \u2206x.\nAt this point a convergent and divergence-free B(r)\nfield has been set up. Inverting such field to obtain the\nvector potential A(r) does not result in any loss of information. Note that inverting B to get A before completing\nthe iteration process would result in a vector potential that\n(by definition) would give divergence-free magnetic field\nbut the bubble would not be magnetically isolated.\nThe equation B = \u2207 \u00d7 A is then solved for A(r) using\na variant of a spectral method as follows.\n(1) we Fourier transform B = \u2207 \u00d7 A\n(2) keeping B(k) and k constant we rotate the k-space\ncoordinate system first around the kz -axis until the projection of the k vector on the (kx , ky ) plane coincides with kx\naxis and then around ky \u2032 -axis until kz \u2032 coincides with the k\nvector. This way the kz \u2032\u2032 -axis is aligned with the k vector.\nThat is,\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nB (k ) 7\u2212\u2192 R(y \u2032 , \u03b1y \u2032 )R(z, \u03b1z )B(k),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere R(i, \u03b1i ) are rotation matrixes around axis i by angle\n\u03b1i .\n(3) we invert B\u2032\u2032 = \u2212ik\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 A\u2032\u2032 (which, in this frame of\n\u2032\u2032\nreference, is trivial as k = (0, 0, 1)).\n(4) we rotate A\u2032\u2032 back and in reverse order, i.e.,\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nA (k ) 7\u2212\u2192 R(z, \u2212\u03b1z )R(y \u2032 , \u2212\u03b1y \u2032 )A (k ),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere A(k) is the Fourier transform of the required vector\npotential. Finally, we inverse FFT A(k) to obtain the\nvector potential in real space.\nThe code uses the vector potential as its \"magnetic\"\nvariable which ensures that divergence of magnetic field is\nstrictly zero throughout the simulation. The reason our initial conditions were not set up directly in terms of the vector potential is that adding bubble as a distortion in the\nfluctuating background vector potential leads to significant\ngradients at the boundary between the bubble and the ICM.\nThese gradients translate into very strong artificial enhancements in the magnetic field surrounding the bubble as we\nhave seen in our experiments with that kind of setup.\nWe also note that the field set up in this way is not\nforce-free. It is not possible to set up force-free field for\nisotropic turbulence case due to mode coupling. However,\ninitial imbalance in magnetic forces are small compared to\nthe buoyancy force acting on bubbles. Moreover, realistic\nturbulence is not expected to be force-free in any case as it\nhas to be continuously driven to prevent its decay.\nNote that the \u03b2 parameter and magnetic field strength\nobtained using the above method would have arbitrary overall normalization. The actual normalization of the magnetic flux is obtained by demanding that the \u03b2 parameter has a certain value inside the bubble, i.e., B(r) 7\u2212\u2192\n\u22121\nB(r)(Pgas \u03b2bub\n/hPB ibub )1/2 , where PB = B 2 /2\u03bco is magnetic pressure, Pgas is the gas pressure, \u03b2bub is the required\nplasma \u03b2 inside the bubble, and averaging is done over the\nbubble volume. We note that this method works best when\napplied to high-\u03b2 cases as then the imbalance between the\ntotal pressure in the bubble and the ICM is smallest.\nThe final form of our initial conditions for the distribution of magnetic pressure for the draping and random cases\nis shown in Figure 3. This figure shows that our method for\ngenerating initial conditions does not produce any spurious\nfeatures on the bubble/ICM interface. The coherence length\nin the lower panel is even smaller than that used in the simulations. This has been done to demonstrate robustness of\nthe method. The map shows natural logarithm of magnetic\npressure in arbitrary units.\nNote that magnetic field configurations were generated\nfrom the same random seed, which means that, despite the\ndifferences due to different power spectra, \u03b2 values, helicities, etc., the fields were as similar as possible. This permits\na better comparison of the consequences of the mentioned\ndifferences.\n\n\f"}
