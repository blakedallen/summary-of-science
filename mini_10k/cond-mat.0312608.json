INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently, the interest on the phenomena of Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) in magnetic\ntunnel junctions (MTJ) has grown significantly due to potential applications in magnetoresistive reading heads, magnetic field sensors, nonvolatile magnetic random access memories,\nand many others1\u20135 . The effect is based on the spin dependent scattering mechanisms\nproposed in the early papers by Cabrera and Falicov6 , which lead in MTJ's, to a strong\ndependence of the conductance on the magnetic polarization7 . Typically, the GMR effect\nfound in MTJ's is of the order of 25 \u2212 30%8,9 , and points to a large ratio of the densities of\nstates for majority (M) and minority (m) electrons at the Fermi level (EF )\nNM (EF )\n\u2248 2.0 \u2212 2.5 .\nNm (EF )\nAs usual in MR experiments, one compares the resistances for the cases where the magnetizations at the electrodes are anti-parallel (AP) and parallel (P). In several experiments\nreported in the literature (see for example Ref. 1, 2, 8, 9), the junction resistance drops significantly with the applied voltages, with a sharp peak at zero bias (zero-bias anomaly). This\nbias dependence shows a rapid initial decrease up to voltages of the order of V \u223c 100 mV ,\nthen slows down but continues decreasing with voltages, up to 60% of the peak value at\n500 mV in some cases9 . Many attempts to explain the above behavior have been done over\nthe last years1,2,8,10 , but a complete theory which includes all the observed features is still\nlacking.\nIn Ref. 8, scattering from magnons at the electrode-insulator interface has been proposed\nas the mechanism for randomizing the tunneling process and opening the spin-flip channels\nthat reduce the MR. While this process may explain the MR behavior in the vicinity of\nzero-bias (voltages smaller than 40 \u2212 100 mV ), estimations of magnon scattering cross\nsections show that the effect is too small to account for the sharp drop in resistance observed\nin the whole range of 500 mV . In fact, inelastic-electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS)\nmeasurements at low temperature showed peaks which can unambiguously be associated\nwith one-magnon spectra at very small voltages (from 12 to 20mV , with tails up to 40mV ,\nand maximum magnon energy not larger than 100 meV )1 . To go beyond this limit will imply\nmultimagnon processes, which are negligible at low temperature. This way, the electronmagnon coupling constant coming from Ref. 8 is by sure considerable overestimated.\nThe above explanation8 has been challenged in Ref. 10, where it is shown that the\nexperimental data can be understood in terms of elastic tunneling currents which conserve\nspin, by considering effects not taken into account in Ref. 8. Those include the lowering of\nthe effective barrier height with the applied voltage, as in the classical Simmons' theory11 ,\nand most important, variations of the densities of states with the bias at both magnetic\nelectrodes. The latter is a relevant question, since experiments probe depths of the order of\n0.5 eV from the Fermi surface. The simple calculation developed in Ref. 10 models the band\nstructure with free electron-like densities of states, since the tunneling current is dominated\nby the s-electron contribution. This approach yields a zero bias anomaly which depends on\nthe band structure, and a variation of the MR which has the right order of magnitude for\nthe whole range of 500 meV . The above discussion and other experimental results primarily\nexhibit that the density of states dependence on the applied voltage plays an important\n2\n\n\frole12,13 . However, fine details of experiments at very small voltages are difficult to fit. One\nmay adopt here a pragmatic procedure, with a more intricate band structure and more free\nparameters to improve the fitting2 .\nIn this paper we take a different stand, motivated by results from IETS experiments1 ,\nwhich show that inelastic scattering do participate in the phenomenon at very small voltages.\nAlso, MR experiments8,9 show clearly a different behavior with applied voltage in the same\nsmall bias region (up to 100 mV ). A complete theory then should include:\ni) magnon assisted tunneling effects, with maximum magnon energies of the order of\n\u223c 100 meV . At low temperature, electrons from the electrodes, accelerated by the\napplied voltage, excite magnons at the interface. At low temperature, only magnonemission processes should be considered;\nii) variation with voltages of the densities of states for the different spin bands in the\nferromagnets. Here, we will follow closely the approach of Ref. 10, with a simple\npicture of the band structure. This is motivated by the discussions given in Ref. 14\nand 10 over the polarization of the tunneling current. We assume here that the latter\nis mainly of s-character;\niii) lowering of the effective barrier height with the applied voltage. This effects, as shown\nin Ref. 11, yields to a parabolic dependence of the resistance with the bias. It does\nnot contribute to the zero-bias anomaly, but it is always present and should dominate\nthe behavior at large voltages.\nThe above program will be developed in the present contribution. The content of this\npaper can be described as follows: In the next Section, we formulate the theoretical basis\nfor analyzing tunneling currents, discussing the transfer Hamiltonian which includes all\nthe above mentioned ingredients. In Section 3, we solely analyze density of states effects,\nconsidering elastic tunneling processes. Some analytical expressions are shown. In Section 4,\nwe include contributions from inelastic magnon-assisted processes to the tunneling current,\nand finally, in the last Section, a few conclusions and remarks are added.\nII. THEORETICAL PRELIMINARIES\n\nTo give a description of the MR and the resistance in the MTJ, we will use the transfer\nHamiltonian method15 . The junction is composed by two ferromagnetic electrodes separated\nby a thin oxide film which represents a potential barrier due to the fact that the Fermi\nlevels of the ferromagnetic layers are situated in the gap region of the oxide film. We have\nconsidered the s-band electrons as free particles (plane-waves), being responsible for the\ndominant contribution to the tunneling process. The d electrons, which are more localized,\nenter in the process only via the exchange interaction with s electrons on each ferromagnetic\nelectrode. In the context of second quantization and neglecting the magnetization energy\n(Zeeman term), the unperturbed Hamiltonian is given by\nH0 =\n\n\u03b1\nEk\u03c3 c\u03b1\u2020\nk\u03c3 ck\u03c3\n\nX\n\nk\u03c3,\u03b1=(L,R)\n\n3\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u03b1\nwith L(R) referring to the left (right) ferromagnetic electrode, c\u03b1\u2020\nk\u03c3 (ck\u03c3 ) are the creation\n2 2\n(annihilation) fermionic operators for wave vector k and spin \u03c3, Ek\u03c3 = h\u03042mk \u2212 \u03c3\u2206\u03b1 is the\nHartree-Fock energy and \u2206\u03b1 is the shift in energy due to exchange interaction in each side\nof the barrier.\nIn writing the interaction part of the total Hamiltonian, which makes possible the transfer\nof electrons from one side of the insulating barrier to the other, we follow Ref. 8. Apart from\nthe direct transfer which comes from elastic processes, we include transfer with magnetic\nexcitations that originates from the s-d exchange between conduction electrons and localized\nspins at the interfaces. The excitations are described by a linearized Holstein-Primakoff\ntransformation16 , in the spirit of a one-magnon theory. We use the following Hamiltonian:\n\nHint =\n\nX\n\nkk\u2032 \u03c3\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nR\u2020 L\nR\ntdkk\u2032 cL\u2020\nk\u03c3 ck\u2032 \u03c3 + ck\u2032 \u03c3 ck\u03c3 +\n\n(2)\n\n\u0013\nq\n\u0011 \u0012q\n1 X J \u0010 L\u2020 R\nR\u2020 L\nL\nR\n+\u221a\nt \u2032 c c \u2032 + ck\u2032 \u2193 ck\u2191\n2SL bq + 2SR bq +\nNs kk\u2032 q kk q k\u2193 k \u2191\n\n\u0013\nq\n\u0011 \u0012q\n1 X J \u0010 L\u2020 R\nR\u2020 L\nL\u2020\nR\u2020\nt \u2032 c c \u2032 + ck\u2032 \u2191 ck\u2193\n2SL bq + 2SR bq +\n+\u221a\nNs kk\u2032 q kk q k\u2191 k \u2193\n\n+\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0011\n1 X J \u0010 L\u2020 R\nR\nR\nL\u2020 L\ntkk\u2032 q ck\u2191 ck\u2032 \u2191 \u2212 cL\u2020\nSL + SR \u2212 bR\u2020\n,\nk\u2193 ck\u2032 \u2193 + h.c.\nq bq + bq bq\nNs kk\u2032 q\n\nwhere tdkk\u2032 is the direct transmission coefficient, tJkk\u2032 q is the inelastic transmission coefficient\n(depends on the exchange integral), S L (S R ) is the spin value at the left (right) side, Ns is the\n\u03b1\ntotal number of spins at the interface, and b\u03b1\u2020\nq (bq ) are the creation (annihilation) operators\nfor magnons with wave vector q at each interface between the barrier and the electrodes.\nThe wave vector q is quasi-two dimensional (the magnon wave function is localized at the\ninterfaces, but with finite localization length).\nIn general, the total current obtained with (2) has contributions from elastic processes,\nresulting in a direct tunneling which conserves spin, and from the inelastic ones, which\ninvolve emission and absorption of magnons with electronic spin flip. In the following we\ndescribe the direct term.\nIII. DIRECT TUNNELING CURRENT: ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS\n\nConsidering only the direct part of the tunneling process, which means elastic processes,\nwithout involving magnon excitations, the current is easily obtained by2,3,8,10\nI(C)\n\n2\u03c0e\n=\nh\u0304\n\nZ\n\ndE T d (E, V, d, \u03a60) W(C) (E, V )[f (E \u2212 eV ) \u2212 f (E)]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nW(C) =\n\nX\n\u03c3\n\nN\u03c3R (E)N\u03c3L (E \u2212 eV )\n\n(4)\n\nand C denotes the configuration scheme, C = P for parallel and C = AP for anti-parallel,\nf (E) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution, N\u03c3R and N\u03c3L the density of states at the right and left\n4\n\n\felectrodes, respectively. T d (E, V, d, \u03a60 ) = |tdkk\u2032 |2 is the tunneling coefficient, being a function\nof the energy E, the applied voltage V , the thickness of the barrier d and the barrier height\n\u03a60 . In fact, T d is a function of the overlap integral between the left and right wave functions\ninside the barrier region.\nThe resistance is readily obtained by R = G\u22121 , where G = dI/dV is the differential\nconductance. In the low bias regime, we are interested in voltages smaller than the Fermi\nenergy and only the states near the Fermi level will contribute to the transport, so we can\nexpand the density of states in a Taylor series as follows:\nN\u03c3\u03b1 (E) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1 dn N\u03c3\u03b1 (E)\ndE n\nn=0 n!\n\nEF\n\n(E \u2212 EF )n .\n\n(5)\n\nNow, let us calculate WC for the P and AP configurations, using (5). In the P configuration the majority and minority bands in each electrode corresponds to the same spin\norientation, and in AP configuration the majority band of one electrode is the minority on\nthe other:\nW(P ) =\n\nR\nL\n1 di NM\n(E) dj NM\n(E \u2212 eV )\n+\ni\ni!j!\ndE\nd (E \u2212 eV )j\n\n\"\n\nXX\ni\n\nj\n\nL\nR\n(E \u2212 eV )\ndi Nm\n(E) dj Nm\n+\ni\ndE\nd (E \u2212 eV )j\n\n#\n\nEF\n\n(6)\n\n(E \u2212 EF )i (E \u2212 eV \u2212 EF )j ,\n\nand\nW(AP ) =\n\nXX\ni\n\nj\n\nR\nL\n(E) dj Nm\n(E \u2212 eV )\n1 di NM\n+\ni\ni!j!\ndE\nd (E \u2212 eV )j\n\n\"\n\nL\nR\n(E \u2212 eV )\ndi Nm\n(E) dj NM\n+\ni\ndE\nd (E \u2212 eV )j\n\n#\n\nEF\n\n(7)\n\n(E \u2212 EF )i (E \u2212 eV \u2212 EF )j ,\n\nTaking into account identical electrodes and the low bias regime, we can expand these\nexpressions to first order with good accuracy. The \u221a\ns-band can be represented by a parabolic\ndispersion relation and density of states N\u03c3 \u221d E \u2212 \u2206\u03c3 , where \u2206\u03c3 (\u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193) gives the\nbottom of the spin band, with |\u2206\u2191 \u2212 \u2206\u2193 | = 2\u2206, as in Ref. 10. However, we consider here\ncases more general than the parabolic dispersion, with the band structure described through\nthe following set of parameters:\nNM\n,\nNm F !\ndNM /dE\n\u03bb\u2261\n,\ndNm /dE!

One is the approach followed by Simmons11 , where the barrier is parametrized\nby an effective height \u03a60 and an effective thickness d:\n\"\n#\n\u0014\nq \u0015\n2 q\n1 \u03b7\u01eb\nT (E, V, \u03a60 , d) = exp[\u2212 d 2m(\u03a60 \u2212 \u03b5z )] = exp \u22121.024 d \u03a60 exp \u221a\nh\u0304\n2 \u03a60\nd\n\n(11)\n\nwhere all energies are measured from the Fermi level and given in eV , the barrier width given\nin Angstrom = 0.1 nm, and \u03b7 is some constant relating the energy \u03b5 with its component\n\u03b5z perpendicular to the barrier. This latter parameter appears due to the fact that we are\nusing a one dimensional formula to explain the behavior in the 3D case.\nSince the Fermi-Dirac functions are step-like at 0\u25e6 K, we can easily obtain the conductance for both configurations.\nG(C)\n.\n\n2\u03c0e2 d\n=\nh\u0304 dV\n\n(Z\n\n0\n\nV\n\nd\n\nd\u01eb T (\u03b5, V, \u03a60 , d) W(C) (\u03b5, V )\n\n)\n\nWith some simplifications in the integration process (taking into account the behavior\nof the integrand in the range of integration, and making use of some geometric arguments),\none obtains\n2\u03c0e2 n\nA(C) T d (V, \u03a60 , d) +\n(12)\nG(C) =\nh\u0304\n)\ni\n1 d h\n+\nB(C) V 2 T d (V, \u03a60 , d) \u2212 C(C) V 3 T d (3V /5, \u03a60, d)\n,\n6 dV\n\nbeing A(C) , B(C) and C(C) constants related to the configuration scheme and the density\nof states.

In turn, the barrier height \u03a60 and thickness d determine the absolute value of the resistance. Typical values used in our examples\nare d = 1.0 nm and \u03a60 = 3.0 eV . Estimation of the resistance of such a junction yields\nresistance-area products of the order of RS \u2248 3.3 \u00d7 104 [\u03a9 \u03bcm2 ], where S is the junction\narea given in \u03bcm2 . This value follows closely the resistance-area scaling obtained for different junctions in Ref. 17, with values of the MR ranging from 16% to 22 %. Representative\nexperimental data of the tunneling resistance dependence on bias are given in Ref. 2, 3, 8,\n9. We compare our theoretical calculation with results presented in Ref. 8 at 4.2\u25e6 K. There,\nthe zero-bias MR is approximately of the order of 25%, which yields for the r parameter of\n(8) and (16) the value r = 2.21. In Fig. 1 we show our theoretical results for the resistance\ncalculated with formulae (13) and (14). The band structure parameters were taken with the\nvalues \u03bb = 0.07 and \u03b2 = 2.7, and the tunneling parameter as \u03b7 = 0.1. The small value of \u03bb\ndepicts a situation where the majority spin band is saturated at the Fermi level, while the\nminority one has a large variation10 .

Note that we get a zero bias anomaly, but a good fit with the experiment is\n\u0012\n\n7\n\n\fonly obtained for the parallel configuration, as in Ref. 10. One can adequate the theoretical\nmodel to a better fit with the data, using more terms in the Taylor expansion of W(C) ,\nor leaving the densities of states as free parameters2 . However, we interpret the failure of\nfitting the data for the AP configuration as a hint that points to the contribution of an\nextra mechanism, which affects differently the P and AP resistances. The linear terms in\n(17) cancel out when one gets the MR, as shown in Fig. 2, along with the experimental\ndata. We pursue our argument further in the next section, with the inclusion of magnon\ninelastic scattering processes in the calculation of the MR.\nIV. MAGNON-ASSISTED INELASTIC TUNNELING\n\nIn this section we consider not only the elastic (spin conserving) processes but inelastic magnon-assisted contributions to the tunneling current. The latter are responsible for\nopening the spin-flip channels, substantially reducing the MR near zero bias. Magnons are\nspin-wave excitations16 which interact with electrons, being emitted or absorbed, thus producing changes in their energy and allowing for spin-flip scattering. Electrons accelerated\nby the electric field relax their energy, producing those collective excitations at the magnetic\nelectrode interfaces. At low temperature, only magnon emission processes give a significant\ncontribution to the resistance. However we analyze in the following the general case, describing each one of the eight processes associated with emission and absorption or magnons.\nThere is one extra term related to the overlap between wave functions of the electrodes, not\ninvolving changes in the number of magnons. This term is proportional to the exchange\ntransmission coefficient T J = |tJkk\u2032q |2 , resulting in a very similar formula to the one found\nfor the direct tunneling in the previous section:\nN\nI(C)\n\n2\u03c0e\n=\nh\u0304\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b5 (SR2 + SL2 ) T J (\u01eb, V, d, \u03a60 ) W(C) (\u03b5, V )[f (\u03b5 \u2212 V ) \u2212 f (\u03b5)] .\n\nLet us consider now the electron tunneling from the left to the right electrode with the\nemission of one magnon at the right side interface:\nE1\nI(C)\n\nZ\n2\u03c0e Z\n=\nd\u03c9 d\u03b5 2SR T J (\u03b5, V, d, \u03a60 ) \u00d7\nh\u0304\n\u00d7 N\u2193L (\u03b5 \u2212 V + h\u0304\u03c9)N\u2191R (\u03b5) \u03c1mag\nR (\u03c9)[1 + fBE (\u03c9)]f (\u03b5 \u2212 V + h\u0304\u03c9)[1 \u2212 f (\u03b5)] ,\n\nbeing \u03c1mag (\u03c9) the density of magnons at the right side interface and fBE the Bose-Einstein\ndistribution:\nfBE =\n\n1\nexp[ kh\u0304\u03c9\nBT\n\n]\u22121\n\nAn identical expression appears when considering the magnon emission at the left side\ninterface yielding:\nE1\nI(C)\n\nZ\n2\u03c0e Z\nmag\nJ\nd\u03c9 d\u03b5 2(SR \u03c1mag\n=\nR (\u03c9) + SL \u03c1L (\u03c9)) T (\u03b5, V, d, \u03a60 ) \u00d7\nh\u0304\n\u00d7 N\u2193L (\u03b5 \u2212 V + h\u0304\u03c9)N\u2191R (E) [1 + fBE (\u03c9)]f (\u03b5 \u2212 V + h\u0304\u03c9)[1 \u2212 f (\u03b5)] .\n\n8\n\n(18)\n\n\fWhen the tunneling occurs from right to left with one magnon emission, we have:\nE2\nI(C)\n\n2\u03c0e\nmag\nJ\n=\nd\u03c9 d\u03b5 2(SR \u03c1mag\nR (\u03c9) + SL \u03c1L (\u03c9)) T (\u03b5, V, d, \u03a60 ) \u00d7\nh\u0304\n\u00d7 N\u2191L (\u03b5 \u2212 V + h\u0304\u03c9)N\u2193R (\u03b5) [1 + fBE (\u03c9)]f (\u03b5)[1 \u2212 f (\u03b5 \u2212 V + h\u0304\u03c9)] .\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(19)\n\nIn turn, for magnon absorption we get:\nA1\nI(C)\n\n2\u03c0e\nmag\nJ\n=\nd\u03c9 d\u03b5 2(SR \u03c1mag\nR (\u03c9) + SL \u03c1L (\u03c9)) T (\u03b5, V, d, \u03a60 ) \u00d7\nh\u0304\n\u00d7 N\u2191L (\u03b5 \u2212 V \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9)N\u2193R (\u03b5) [fBE (\u03c9)]f (\u03b5 \u2212 V \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9)[1 \u2212 f (\u03b5)]\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(20)\n\nand\nA2\nI(C)\n\n2\u03c0e\nmag\nJ\n=\nd\u03c9 d\u03b5 2(SR \u03c1mag\nR (\u03c9) + SL \u03c1L (\u03c9)) T (\u03b5, V, d, \u03a60 ) \u00d7\nh\u0304\n\u00d7 N\u2193L (\u03b5 \u2212 V \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9)N\u2191R (\u03b5) [fBE (\u03c9)]f (\u03b5)[1 \u2212 f (\u03b5 \u2212 V \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9)] .\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(21)\n\nThe total current due to one magnon exchange is then:\nN\nE1\nE2\nA1\nA2\nImag = I(C)\n+ I(C)\n\u2212 I(C)\n+ I(C)\n\u2212 I(C)\n\n(22)\n\nTypical IET magnon spectra are shown by Ando and coworkers in Ref. 1.

Introducing this low energy cutoff in the magnon spectrum, and taking the low\ntemperature limit T \u2192 0\u25e6 K, we get fBE \u2192 0 for the Bose-Einstein distribution.

In\nother words Em is the maximum magnon energy (high energy cutoff)1 . Considering the\nabove discussion, assuming identical ferromagnetic electrodes, and after some mathematical\nsimplifications, one finally gets the conductance in the form:\nGC = GdC + Gmag\nC\nwhere GdC is given by (13) and (14), for P and AP alignment respectively, and Gmag\nis shown\nC\nbelow:\n9\n\n\fGmag\n=\nP\n\nh\ni\n2\u03c0e2 J\nT (V ) 2S 2 W(P ) + \u039b(V )SW(AP ) ,\nh\u0304\n\n(24)\n\nGmag\nAP =\n\nh\ni\n2\u03c0e2 J\nT (V ) 2S 2 W(AP ) + 2\u039b(V )SW(P ) ,\nh\u0304\n\n(25)\n\nand\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nwith S = S R + S L /2 and\n\u039b (V ) =\n\n(\n\nV /Em for V < Em ,\n2 \u2212 Em /V for V > Em .\n\nThe functions W(P ) and W(AP ) in (24) and (25) have been evaluated near zero bias, using\nformulae (9) and (10) respectively, substituting \u03b5 by the constant value 0.1 eV . We point out\nthat magnon processes significantly contribute to the conductance only for voltages below\n100 mV , and so we can consider W(P ) and W(AP ) as almost constant under the integration\nsign. The exchange tunneling coefficient T J generally is one or two orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the direct coefficient. We found excellent agreement between our theory and\nthe experimental data using the same set of parameters of Fig. 1 for the tunneling barrier and\nthe electronic structure, spin S = 3/2 and T d /T J = 37 for the ratio of the direct tunneling\nto the exchange tunneling coefficient. The magnon cutoff Em was taken to be 90 meV .\nThe results are shown in Fig. 3 for the resistances and in Fig. 4 for the corresponding\nMR. Clearly, the AP configuration is more sensible to the magnon contribution, since the\nL\nR\ncurrent for that configuration is weighted by the product NM\nNM\n, which is much bigger\nL R\nL\nR\nthan the factors Nm\nNM or NM\nNm\nwhich appear in the P current, with the indices m and\nM referring to minority and majority spin bands (compare Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). Obviously,\nminor differences between theory and experimental data come from the fact that we are\nusing a very simplified model for the band structure and the magnon dispersion relation.\nWe comment on these results in the next section.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a consistent study of the voltage dependence of the 'giant' magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic tunneling junctions. Our approach includes: a) lowering of\nthe effective barrier height with the applied voltage; b) different variations of the density of\nstates for each spin band with voltage; and c) magnon assisted inelastic tunneling near zero\nbias. We found that taking into account all those effects is essential to fully explain experimental results at low temperature for the voltage range between 0 and 500 mV . We have\nalso clarify the role of the different parameters used in the theory: some of them (d, \u03a60 , \u03b7)\ndetermine the absolute value of the resistance at zero bias, which in turn is a scale factor\nin the theory; a different set, related to the band structure (r, \u03b2, \u03bb), mainly monitors the\nglobal behavior with voltage and the value of the junction MR. To adjust our results with\nselected experimental data, we have taken \u03b2, \u03bb > 0, but as shown in Ref. 10, this scenario\nis not unique and depends on the topology of the bands that contribute to the current;\nand finally, the behavior near zero bias (zero bias anomaly), with a rapid decrease of the\n10\n\n\fresistance for the AP configuration up to 100 mV , is ascribed to magnon-assisted tunneling.\nOur estimation of T d /T J \u223c 40 seems to be more realistic than previous estimations8 . We\nnote that the latter is the only adjustable parameter to fit the voltage dependence below\n100 mV (for both, P and AP configurations). Our calculation is in excellent agreement with\nthe experimental data (see Fig. 3 and 4).\nTemperature effects are not discussed in this paper. As shown in Section IV, only magnon\nemission processes are included at low temperature (T \u2192 0). At finite temperature, we\nexpect a decrease of the resistance near zero bias, due to one-magnon-absorption assisted\ntunneling18 . The above should be superimposed to the thermal smearing in the Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution of tunneling electrons3 .\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge partial financial support from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o do Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP, SP, Brazil), through the project #\n2002/09895-6.\n\n11\n\n\fREFERENCES\n1\n\nY.

The resistances are given in arbitrary units, normalized to the peak value at zero\nbias.\nFig.2 Magnetoresistance as a function of voltage. Parameters are kept the same as in\nFig.1.\nFig.3 Resistance, in arbitrary units, as a function of the voltage bias for the AP and\nP configurations: the experimental results (dotted line and symbols) are taken from Ref.\n8 and the theoretical ones (solid lines) include magnon-assisted tunneling. Parameters are\nkept the same as in Fig. 1, with the addition of T d /T J = 37.\nFig.4 Magnetoresistance as a function of voltage. Parameters are kept the same as in\nFig.3.\n\n13\n\n\f"}
