We extend their data,\nshowing that it is more likely that the proportion goes to zero.\n1.1 Introduction\nLet Em be the elliptic curve defined by the equation x3 + y 3 = m, which\nis isomorphic to y 2 = x3 \u2212432m2. The case of m = 1 is the curve X0 (27),\nand the cubefree positive m-values correspond to cubic twists.\nThese equations have a long history, dating back to Fermat. An early\nstudy was done by Sylvester [Syl] in 1879-80, and another voluminous\nstudy in 1951 by Selmer [Sel]. In between these two, Nagell [N, p.14]\nproved sundry results concerning non-solvability in many cases. In the\nlate 1960s, Stephens [Ste1, Ste2] did numerical experiments with these\ncurves with respect to the then-new Birch\u2013Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.\nZagier and Kramarz [ZK] did a large numerical experiment in the 1980s,\nwhich led them to suggest that a positive proportion of the curves have\nrank 2 or greater. The best results in this regard appear to be due to\nMai [M1, M2], who showed that, assuming the Parity Conjecture, for\nevery \u01eb > 0 at least c\u01eb T 2/3\u2212\u01eb of the cubefree even twists up to T have\nrank 2. Elkies and Rogers [ER] have recently found that the curve\nx3 + y 3 = 13293998056584952174157235\nhas rank at least 11. We shall mainly be concerned with rank 2 cubic\ntwists and in extending the numerical data of [ZK], showing that the\npurported positive proportion does not seem to persist. We also consider questions of the distribution of the size of the Tate\u2013Shafarevitch\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMark Watkins\n\ngroups attached to these curves, comment on effects stemming from the\narithmetic of m, consider similar questions for quartic twists of X0 (32),\nand discuss random matrix models for these.\nWe briefly review how to compute the central L-value of Em . The first\nconsideration is the sign of the functional equation, which was computed\nQ\nby Birch and Stephens\u0001[BS]. This is defined by \u01eb = p \u01ebp where for p 6= 3\nwe have that \u01ebp = p3 if p|m and \u01ebp = +1 if p does not divide m. For\np = 3, we have that \u01eb3 = +1 if m \u2261 \u00b11 (mod 9) or 3km, and \u01eb3 = \u22121\nQ\notherwise. Next, there is the conductor N = p Np where for p 6= 3 we\nhave that Np = p2 if p|m and Np = 1 otherwise, while for p = 3 we have\nthat N3 = 35 if 3|m, that N3 = 32 if m \u2261 \u00b12 (mod 9), and N3 = 33\notherwise. There are also Tamagawa numbers and considerations for the\nreal period \u03a9; the effects of these are given in the last section (see also\nTable 1 of [ZK]).\nWhen \u01eb = +1, the central L-value is given by\n\u221a\nX am (n)\ne\u22122\u03c0n/ N ,\nL(Em , 1) = 2\nn\nn\nwhere the conductor N is defined as above, and the am (n) can be computed as follows. For primes p 6\u2261 1 (mod 3) and primes p|3m, we define am (p) = 0. Given a prime p \u2261 1 (mod 3), the set\nAp = {a| a \u2261 2 (mod 3), a2 + 3b2 = 4p for some b \u2208 Z}\nhas 3 elements. For such a prime we define a1 (p) to be the unique\nelement in Ap for which 3|b. We then define am (p) uniquely by the\nconditions am (p) \u2261 m(p\u22121)/3 a1 (p) (mod p) and am (p) \u2208 Ap (this second\n\u221a\ncondition is equivalent to |am (p)| < 2 p for p > 13 and not p \u2265 13 as\n[ZK] claims). Having defined am (p) for all primes p, we extend it to\nprime powers via the Hecke relations, and then to all positive integers\nvia multiplicativity.\nIn order to approximate L(Em , 1) well, we need\n\u221a\nto use about C N coefficients for some constant C. When \u01eb = \u22121,\nthe series for L\u2032 (Em , 1) has the exponential function replaced by an\nexponential integral - we did not deal with this case ([ZK] considered\nit for m \u2264 20000) since the exponential homomorphism can be computed\nrapidly more readily than the exponential integral - for the latter, local\npower series would likely be useful. Lieman [L] has shown that the values\nof L(Em , 1) are the coefficients of a metaplectic form as was suggested\nin [ZK, 3.1], but this does not seem useful for computational purposes.\nWe did not try to use the conditions given by Rodriguez Villegas and\nZagier [RVZ], and cannot comment on their computational efficacy.\n\n\fRank distribution in a family of cubic twists\n\n3\n\n1.2 Numerical data\nApplying the above method for the cubefree m \u2264 107 with \u01eb = +1, we\nfind that about 17.7% of the twists have vanishing central L-value. This\nis to be compared to 23.3% for the m \u2264 70000, and 20.5% for m \u2264 106 .\nIf we take the best linear fit to a log-log regression, we find that the\nnumber of twists up to x with vanishing central L-value appears to grow\nlike x0.935 . Heuristic models involving the expected size of X as in [ZK]\nimply that the growth should be more like x5/6 . Stronger models such\nas those in [CKRS] imply this should be more like Bx5/6 (log x)C for\nsome constants B and C; in the last section we make remarks about\nwhat random matrix theory implies about C.\n800000\n\n700000\n\nnumber of even vanishing twists\n\n600000\n\n500000\n\n400000\n\n300000\n\n200000\n\n100000\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nsize of twist parameter d in millions\n\nFig. 1.1. Number of even vanishing cubic twists of X0 (27) compared to a\n(dotted) straight line.\n\nThere is also the question of arithmetic effects of m. Only 6.1% of\nthe prime m in the above range have vanishing central L-value, while\n11.3% of the m with two prime factors do, and 17.1% of the m with\nthree prime factors. The number grows to 24.5% for four prime factors,\nand 35.3% for five prime factors, and is 51.4% for six or more prime\nfactors. However, each of these percentages is about 20% lower than\nthe comparative value when considering only the m \u2264 106 . So even\n\n\f4\n\nMark Watkins\n\nif we restrict to prime m we expect that the proportion of twists with\nnon-vanishing central L-value tends to zero. Note in this context that\n3-descent can tell us much about the rank when we limit the number of\nprime factors of m (see [C]). For instance, when m is prime and Em has\neven functional equation, we know that m \u2261 1, 2, 5 (mod 9), and the\nrank is zero in the latter two cases. Thus the 6.1% of above might be\nre-interpreted as 18.3% of the cases where descent considerations do not\nforce the rank to be zero. Using the results of [N], we could similarly\nderive such results when m has two prime factors. Also, one can recall\nthat Elkies (see [E1]) has proven that the rank is exactly 1 for primes\nm \u2261 4, 7 (mod 9); here in fact the conjecture is that the same is true\nfor m \u2261 8 (mod 9). We return to such considerations below when we\ndiscuss random matrix models.\nWe next make some comments about how often various |X|-values\noccur. Zagier and Kramarz found that 26.3% of the even twists for\nm \u2264 70000 have rank 0 and trivial X, while we find the percentage to\nbe 18.8% for m \u2264 106 and 14.1% for m \u2264 107 . Indeed, already in [ZK]\nthis percentage was noted to be diminishing. More interesting might be\nhow often a given prime divides |X|, under the restriction to rank 0\ntwists. For instance, 32.4% of the even rank 0 twists with m \u2264 70000\nhave 3 dividing |X|. This number increases to 40.1% for m \u2264 106 , and\nis 45.3% for m \u2264 107 . The heuristics of [De] imply a number more like\n36.1%. There is a strong arithmetic impact from m, as for prime m the\npercentage for m \u2264 107 is only 5.8%. However, this last datum should\nprobably be considered anomalous because of the special role that 3\nplays in the cubic twists.\nSimilarly, 2 divides |X| about 45.7% of the time for even rank 0 twists\nwith m \u2264 107 , while only 42.1% of the time for m \u2264 106 and 35.5% of\nthe time for m \u2264 70000. Here Delaunay predicts 58.1%. Here prime m\nare more likely to cause 2-divisibility of |X|, with the percentage here\nfor m \u2264 107 being 53.5%. As [ZK] notes, the expectation is that |X|\nshould be of size m1/3 \u2248 N 1/6 for these cubic twists, larger than the\nexpected N 1/12 in the general case. For 5-divisibility of |X|, the percentage increases from 3.6% to 5.9% to 8.0%. It seems unlikely that\nthese percentages (for p 6= 3) will climb all the way to 100%, and without a better guess, one could posit that they are tending toward the\nnumber suggested by the Delaunay heuristic. In Table 1.1, the \"r > 0\"\ncolumn counts percentages of curves for which the central L-value vanishes, while the other four columns denote how often a given prime\ndivides the |X|-value of a nonvanishing twist.\n\n\fRank distribution in a family of cubic twists\n\n5\n\nTable 1.1.

O. Rubinstein that quadratic twist data\nfor |X| tend to the Delaunay number more readily upon including all\neven rank twists, instead of just the ones of rank 0. Indeed, as we expect\nthat the high rank twists should form an asymptotically negligible set,\nthere is perhaps no reason not to include them in our data. Furthermore,\nadditionally restricting to prime twists also tends to speed convergence\ntoward the number given by Delaunay. Upon implementing these two\nideas, we get numbers of 56.3% for 2-divisibility, 19.7% for 5-divisibility,\nand 13.8% for 7-divisibility, which are fairly close to the percentages\npredicted by Delaunay. For 3-divisibility we have only 11.6%, as the\nexistence of 3-isogenies for our curves appears to have a definite impact\n(Rubinstein reports similar phenomena for quadratic twists).\nOne can do a similar experiment with quartic twists of X0 (32) or sextic\ntwists of X0 (27). We only looked at the former. For the computation\nof the sign of the functional equation in these cases, see [ST]. Note that\n[ZK] look at the quadratic twists of X0 (32) given by y 2 = x3 \u2212 m2 x with\nm \u2261 1 (mod 16) for m \u2264 500000, and they find that the percentage of\nvanishing twists is dropping fairly rapidly, it being 15.2% for m \u2264 50000\nand 10.6% for m \u2264 500000. For the quartic twists of X0 (32) we are\nlooking at y 2 = x3 + mx where 4 does not divide m and m is free of\nfourth powers. Here we consider positive m \u2264 8000000, of which 24.9%\nof the even twists have vanishing central value. This is less than the\n27.4% for m \u2264 106 , and 29.8% for m \u2264 105 . Similar percentages occur\nfor the negative m.\n\n1.3 Computational techniques\nThe computations were carried out on a network of about 10 SPARC\nmachines (mostly SPARC-V) over a 6-month period at the beginning\nof 2001. Our bound of m \u2264 107 was chosen as we were mainly interested\n\n\f6\n\nMark Watkins\n\nin the question of extra vanishing, and seemed sufficient to answer the\nquestion posed by [ZK] on whether the rate remained constant. With\ntoday's technology, extending the experiment to m \u2264 108 should be\nfeasible, as should a similar experiment looking at cubic twists with odd\nfunctional equation.\nAs stated in [ZK], the computation of the am (n) takes time O(log n) if\nn is prime and O(1) time otherwise (using the multiplicativity relations,\nviewing the values for the primes dividing n as taking negligible time\nas they are already computed). We computed the values of a1 (p) for\np \u2264 109 once-and-for-all ahead of time, and then read these from disk as\nneeded. Additionally, tricks such as fast modular exponentiation were\nused to speed up the\u221a computation of m(p\u22121)/3 mod p. Similarly, the\ncomputing of e\u22122\u03c0n/ N was faciliated by the fact that the exponential\nfunction\u221ais a homomorphism; for a given N , we computed various powers\nof e\u22122\u03c0/ N and then for each n multiplied these together as needed to get\nthe desired value. For the computation of L(Em , 1), and the question of\nhow far the infinite sum need be computed, we followed a method similar\n2\nto that of [ZK], calculating the |X|-value Sm = Tc\u03a9 L(Em , 1) where T is\nthe size of the torsion group, c is the global Tamagawa number, and \u03a9\nis the real period (see pages 54\u201356 of [ZK] for these). We then stop the\ncalculation when Sm is sufficiently close to an integer (possibly zero).\nAs a check, we expect all the Sm values to be squares, which indeed does\nturn out to be the case.\n\n1.4 Random matrix models\nIn this section we make some comments about random matrix theory\nand the expected number of even cubic twists of X0 (27) which have\nvanishing central L-value. We follow the ideas of [CKRS] and [DFK].\nIn our case of cubic twists, we expect, as do [CKRS], to have symmetry\ntype O+ , that is, orthogonal with positive determinant. This is because\nthe sign of our functional equation is always +1. Note that [DFK] have\nunitary symmetry in their type of cubic twist, due to the fact that the\nfunctional equation has an essentially arbitrary complex number (related\nto a Gauss sum) appearing in it.\nWe write E = X0 (27) and Ed for the dth cubic twist of E. As given\nin equations (20), (22), and (16) of [CKRS], the assumption of O+ sym\u221a\nmetry implies that PE (N, x) = cE N 3/8 / x should approximate (for\nsmall x) the probability density\nR X function for values of L(Ed , 1), where\nN \u223c log X and we integrate 0 PE (N, x) dx to get an expected proba-\n\n\fRank distribution in a family of cubic twists\n\n7\n\nbility that L(Ed , 1) is less than X. The idea is that we know that the\nactual values of L(Ed , 1) are discretised (due to the Birch\u2013SwinnertonDyer formula), and thus we declare (in a somewhat arbitrary manner)\nsufficiently small values of L(Ed , 1) to indicate that in fact we have\nL(Ed , 1) = 0. We recall that BSD implies we have\nY\nL(Ed , 1)\n|Xd |\ncp *\n=\n\u03a9d\n|Td |2\np|3d\n\nwhere \u03a9d is the real period of Ed , the cp are Tamagawa numbers, Xd\nis the Shafarevitch\u2013Tate group, and Td is the torsion group of Ed . We\nare thus thinking of |Xd | (which is a square) as our discretised variable, with everything else being computable. When d > 2 the torsion\ngroup is trivial. For cubefree d we have that \u03a9d = \u03a91 /d1/3 , except when\n9|d in which case we have \u03a9d = 3\u03a91 /d1/3 . Note that in definition (8)\nof [CKRS], quadratic twists that are not relatively prime to the conductor are excluded; we will similarly exclude twists that are divisible by 3,\nthough one could deal with them via making appropriate corrections.\nFor the Tamagawa product we have that c3 = 3 when d \u2261 \u00b11 (mod 9),\nc3 = 2 when d \u2261 \u00b12 (mod 9), and c3 = 1 otherwise, while cp = 3 for\nprimes p \u2261 1 (mod 3) and cp = 1 for primes p \u2261 2 (mod 3). Given this\ndivergent behaviour based upon prime divisibility, as in Conjecture 1\nof [CKRS] we decided to restrict to prime twists, and additionally split\nthe primes into congruence classes modulo 9. Indeed, it is calculable\nthat the sign of the functional equation is odd when our prime twist d\nis congruent to 4, 7, 8 (mod 9), and by 3-descent we can verify that the\nrank is zero when d is 2 or 5 (mod 9). Moreover, again by 3-descent, we\nknow that the rank is at most 2 (and the functional equation is even)\nwhen d is 1 mod 9. Computing as with equation (23) in [CKRS] we get\nthe following:\nQuestion 1.4.1 Let VT be the set of primes d less than T congruent to\n1 modulo 9 with L(Ed , 1) = 0. Is there some constant c 6= 0 such that\nX\n1 \u223c cT 5/6 (log T )\u22125/8\n?\nd\u2208VT\n\nAssuming an affirmative answer, our data give a constant of approximately c = 1/6. The argument is similar for quartic twists of X0 (32) or\nsextic twists of X0 (27), and we can expect asymptotics for prime twists\nof order T 7/8 (log T )\u22125/8 and T 11/12 (log T )\u22125/8 , and upon restricting to\nvarious congruence classes we should get appropriate constants in front\n\n\f8\n\nMark Watkins\n\nof these. Via techniques from prime number theory and considerations\nfrom Tamagawa numbers, one should be able to argue as in [CKRS] to\nget an asymptotic for all cubefree twists.\nFinally we derive a version of Conjecture 2 of [CKRS] suitable for\ncubic, quartic, and sextic twists. For cubic twists, for a given prime\np \u2261 1 (mod 3) there are 3 solutions to a2 +3b2 = 4p with a \u2261 2 (mod 3),\nwhich correspond to the three possibilities for the Frobenius trace ap .\nThe argument given from (27)-(31) in [CKRS] does not differ (see below),\nand so we get the following:\nQuestion 1.4.2 Let p \u2265 5 be prime, and for 1 \u2264 q \u2264 p \u2212 1 let Fpq (T ) be\nthe set of cubefree positive integers d \u2261 q (mod p) that are less than T\nsuch that x3 + y 3 = d has even functional equation. Letting ad (p) be the\npth trace of Frobenius for x3 + y 3 = d (where d need not be cubefree), do\nwe have\n\u0012 X\n\u001e X\n\u0013 s\np + 1 \u2212 aY (p)\nlim\n1\n1 =\n?\nT \u2192\u221e\np + 1 \u2212 aZ (p)\nY\nZ\nd\u2208Fp (T )\n\nd\u2208Fp (T )\n\nWe can also make a similar calculation for quartic and sextic twists.\nIn Tables 1.2-1.4 below we list vanishing probabilities in support of an\naffirmative answer to the above question; the c-column represents\n\u221a\n\u221a \u221a which\n3\n:\n9\n:\n12],\ncongruence class is used. For p =\n7\nthe\nratios\nshould\nbe\n[\n\u221a\n\u221a \u221a\nand for p = 13 they should be [ 9 : 12 : 21].\nWe also have some data (see Tables 1.6-1.8) for the vanishing frequencies for positive\u0002\u221aquartic\n\u221a twists\n\u221a of\u221a X0\u0003(32). For p = 5 the ratios\nshould\u221abe given\n\u221a by\n\u221a \u00032 : 4 : 8 : 10 ; for p = 13 they should be\n\u0002\u221a\n8 : 10 : 18 : 20 .\nThe heuristic for Conjecture 2 in [CKRS] is based upon supposed\ncancellation from a quadratic character, whereas in our cubic twist case\nthe source of cancellation is perhaps not so transparent. Therefore we\ngo through the details. We have that\n\u0013k\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX \u0012X\nX X\nad (n)\nbd (n)\nL(Ed , 1/2)k =\n=\n,\nn\nn\nq\nq\nq\nn=1\nn=1\nd\u2208Fp (T )\n\nd\u2208Fp (T )\n\nP\n\nd\u2208Fp (T )\n\nwhere bm (n) = n=n1 ***nk am (n1 ) * * * am (nk ) with the sum being over\nall ways of writing n as a product of k positive factors. If we invert\nthe order of summation in this last expression, the sum over d should\ntypically have much cancellation since the bd (n) are essentially randomly\ndistributed. This, however, is not the case for n that are a power of p,\n\n\fRank distribution in a family of cubic twists\n\n9\n\nas here the value of ad (pr ) is fixed since d is fixed modulo p. Thus we\nshould get a main contribution in the above by restricting to values of n\nthat are powers of p (indeed, if we did this argument with no congruence\nrestriction we would expect n = 1 to give the main term). As in (31) of\n[CKRS] we thus get that\nX\nX X bd (pr )\nX \u0012X ad (pr ) \u0013k\nk\nL(Ed , 1/2) \u223c\n=\n=\npr\npr\nq\nq\nq\npr\npr\nd\u2208Fp (T )\n\nd\u2208Fp (T )\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u2208Fp (T )\n\np\np + 1 \u2212 ad (p)\n\n\u0013k\n\nX\n\n1.\n\nd\u2208Fpq (T )\n\nWe complete our heuristic by first noting that the sets Fpq (T ) have\nasymptotically equal sizes and then taking k = \u22121/2 as is suggested\nby the random matrix theory of [CKRS]. Note that a similar heuristic\ncan be given for moments of higher derivatives, but the combinatorics\nbecome more difficult due to the presence of logarithms. In this context,\nthe data of Elkies [E2] distinctly show a congruence-class phenomenon\nfor rank 3 quadratic twists of X0 (32).\n\n1.5 Acknowledgments\nThe author was partially funded by an NSF VIGRE Postdoctoral Fellowship at The Pennsylvania State University for part of the time this work\nwas done.
