We compare a multi-level statistical model with a two-level model for the decay out of superdeformed rotational\nbands in atomic nuclei. We conclude that while the models depend on different dimensionless combinations of the input\nparameters and differ in certain limits, they essentially agree in the cases where experimental data is currently available. The\nimplications of this conclusion are discussed.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nSuperdeformed (SD) rotational bands occur in the second minimum of the potential energy surface in deformation\nspace. They have been observed in several mass regions around A=20, 40, 80, 130, 150, 165, 190 and 240 [1].\nCharacteristic of the decay of most superdeformed bands is the sudden disappearance of the total intra-band decay\nintensity when a certain spin is reached. The intensity reappears as electromagnetic transitions in the normal deformed\n(ND) minimum. In certain special cases the decay path subsequent to the SD band is known completely as it is\nfor 133 Nd [2], or almost completely as for 59 Cu [3]. More typical however is the situation in the A = 80, 150 and\n190 regions, where the decay from superdeformed to normal states is spread over many different available paths,\nmaking observation of discrete \u03b3 rays linking SD and ND states very difficult. Because of this fragmentation of the\nSD intensity, experimentalists have only been able to identify a small number of the strongest paths in a few cases\n[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and these only when very large data sets have been obtained. In these more typical regions\nit is reasonably clear that there remains barrier between the minima at the decay-out spin and consequently that the\ndecay-out occurs by tunneling [12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\nThe fact that the decay path is unknown has been thought to indicate that a statistical treatment of the ND states and\ntheir coupling to the SD band [17, 18] is appropriate. This approach is expected be valid when the ND level density is\nso high as to make a useful description of the coupling to individual ND states unfeasible. However, given that there\nis uncertainty concerning the ND level density around the SD band there remains the possibility that the decay-out\noccurs entirely through a single ND level. The ND level density depends strongly on the excitation energy of the SD\nstate; as SD bands have been observed at relatively low energies in the Pb isotopes, the point of view encompassed by a\ntwo-level model where the decaying SD state couples to a single ND state (itself decaying) could be more appropriate.\nIndeed, in Ref. [19] the decay-out in the A=190 region is attributed to the crossing of the SD band with the nearest\nneighboring excited ND band.\nIn this contribution we propose to compare the two limiting descriptions mentioned in the previous paragraph\nas embodied by the multi-level statistical model of Refs. [20, 21] which exploit analogies of the SD decay with\nthe theory of compound nucleus reactions [22] and the two-level model of Refs. [23, 24, 25]. Neither approach\nprovides a microscopic description of the decay-out such those provided by the cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky model\nof Refs. [12, 13, 14, 15], the cluster model of Ref. [19] and the generator coordinate model of Ref. [26]. Rather, both\nmodels considered here are phenomenological models which attempt to provide simple formulas for the total intraband decay intensity in terms of the most relevant parameters. Instead of analyzing the experimental data, in what\nfollows we shall only compare the statistical and two-level models in their formal aspects.\n\n\fJ+2\n\u0393S\n\u03b5j\nJ\nVjS\n\n\u03b5S\n\n\u0393S\n\nJ\n\u0393N\n\nJ\u22122\n\nJ\u22121\nFIGURE 1.

The SD (ND) states have a common electromagnetic width \u0393S (\u0393N ).\n\nMULTI-LEVEL STATISTICAL MODELS\n\nLet us denote the decaying SD state by |Si, its energy by \u03b5S and its electromagnetic width by \u0393S .

The energy average of G(E) is given by\nG(E) =\n\nZ\n\nG(E \u2032 )p(E, E \u2032 )dE \u2032 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the smoothing function p(E, E \u2032 ) is normally a Lorentzian or a box function [22]. The energy average is carried\nout for a single realization of the GOE Hamiltonian HNN \u2032 and is expected to be equal to the ensemble average to the\nextent that the GOE is ergodic. In practice calculations proceed by choosing a representation - the optical background\nrepresentation of Kawai, Kerman and McVoy [30] - which is defined such that the couplings VNS have statistical\nproperties which are convenient for analytical calculation. (It was checked numerically in Ref. [31] that the properties\nof the VNS which are normally assumed do indeed obtain from the underlying random Hamiltonian.) In order to obtain\nanalytical results it is further necessary to assume that \u0393N /D \u226b 1 which is the principal limitation of the energy\naveraging technique. The optical background representation was used in Ref. [21] to calculate FS . The result has the\nsame form as Eq. (6) with FSav still given by Eq. (7) but now\nFSfl = 2 (\u03c0 \u0393N /D)\u22121 FSav (1 \u2212 FSav )2 ,\n\n\u0393N /D \u226b 1.\n\n(12)\n\nAn advantage of the energy averaging technique is that it also yields an analytical expression for the variance of the\ndecay intensity [21]:\n\u00012\n(\u2206FS )2 = FS \u2212 FS\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u00132 Z \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u0393S\n\u2217\n\u2032\ndE\ndE\nGflSS (E)GflSS (E \u2032 )\n=\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\n\n+ 2ReGSS (E)\u2217 GSS (E \u2032 ) GflSS (E)GflSS (E \u2032 )\n\n2\n\n= FSfl f1 (\u03be ) + 2FSav FSfl f2 (\u03be ) ,\n\n\u2217\n\ni\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03be = (\u0393S + \u0393)/\u0393N and\nf1 (\u03be ) =\n\n\u03be\n\u03be2\n1\n+\n+\n,\n2\n(1 + \u03be ) (1 + \u03be )\n2 (1 + \u03be )3\n\nf2 (\u03be ) =\n\n1\n.\n2 (1 + \u03be )\n\n(14)\n\nFrom Eqs.

Schematic diagram of the two-level mixing model. The decaying SD state under consideration mixes via the coupling\nV with a single ND state of the same spin and energy \u03b5N = \u03b5S + \u2206.\n\nD. In Ref. [20] it is conjectured using supersymmetry arguments [29, 32] that the entire probability distribution of\nFS depends only on \u0393/\u0393S and \u0393N /D. In contradiction to this conjecture the expression for the variance of FS derived\nusing the energy averaging technique, Eq. (13), depends on the additional dimensionless variable (\u0393S + \u0393)/\u0393N .\nAt present the energy dependence of |GSS (E)|2 and |GNS (E)|2 cannot be resolved experimentally and the focus of\ntheory has been on the analysis of FS or FN . Normally, \u0393S , \u0393N and D are estimated theoretically and a value of V is\nextracted from the experimental FS [33]. An intrinsic problem of the statistical model in its application to the decay\nout of SD bands is that the variance of FS is large when \u0393N /D \u226a 1 reflecting the fact that in this limit the positions of\nthe individual ND states relative to the SD state are important [20]. Since \u0393N /D \u226a 1 for the cases which have been\nstudied experimentally the preceding argument suggests that the error in the extracted V must also be large. However,\nfrom Eqs. (13) and (14) it can be seem that the variance of FS is suppressed not only for \u0393N /D \u226b 1 but also for\n(\u0393 + \u0393S )/\u0393N \u226b 1. This is physically plausible since in the decay of an ND state to the SD state the larger the value of\n\u0393 + \u0393S the less important the exact position of the SD state.\n\nTWO-LEVEL MIXING MODEL\nIn the two-level mixing model the decaying SD state of energy \u03b5S and electromagnetic width \u0393S is coupled to single\nND state of energy \u03b5N and electromagnetic width \u0393N by the coupling matrix element V (see Fig. 2). In analogy to\nEqs. (1) and (2), the intra-band decay is described by the Green's function\nGSS (E) =\n\n1\n2\n\nE \u2212 \u03b5S + i\u0393S /2 \u2212 E\u2212\u03b5 V+ i \u0393\nN\n\n(15)\n\n2 N\n\nand the decay-out by the Green's function\nGNS (E) =\n\nV\n\n(E \u2212 \u03b5N +\n\n.\ni\ni\n2\n2 \u0393N )(E \u2212 \u03b5S + 2 \u0393S ) \u2212 V\n\n(16)\n\nThe decay-out intensity, FN , is given by Eq. (4) (instead of a sum over N there is just one term) and an exact calculation\nyields [23]\n(1 + \u0393N /\u0393S )V 2\n,\n(17)\nFN = 2\n\u2206 + \u0393\u03042 (1 + 4V 2 /\u0393N \u0393S )\n\n\fwhere\n\u0393\u2193 =\n\n2V 2 \u0393\u0304\n,\n\u22062 + \u0393\u03042\n\n(18)\n\n\u0393\u0304 = (\u0393S + \u0393N )/2 and \u2206 = \u03b5N \u2212 \u03b5S . An alternative form is [25]\nFN =\n\n\u0393N \u0393\u2193 /(\u0393N + \u0393\u2193 )\n.\n\u0393S + \u0393N \u0393\u2193 /(\u0393N + \u0393\u2193 )\n\n(19)\n\n\u0393N\n)\u22121 .\n\u2193\n\u0393 + \u0393N\n\n(20)\n\nSince FS = 1 \u2212 FN this implies that\nFS = (1 + \u0393\u2193 /\u0393S\n\nFrom Eq. (17) it may be seen that FN depends on three independent dimensionless variables which may be taken to\nbe V /\u2206, \u0393\u0304/\u2206 and \u0393S /\u0393N . The calculations of Ref. [19] suggest that the value of \u2206 is rather important and in fact\ndetermines the decay-out spin in the sense that the decay-out occurs very near to where the SD band crosses the\nnearest excited ND band. The behavior of FS as a function of \u2206 for a model related to the two-level model is discussed\nin Ref. [34]. In the event that \u2206 could be calculated it would be favorable to use Eq. (17) to extract V from the\nexperimental FN .\nAn alternative to calculating \u2206 is to assume that it obeys some probability distribution. In Ref. [25] it was assumed\nthat \u2206 has the distribution\nZ \u221e\ndsPs (\u2206)P(s),\n(21)\nP(\u2206) =\n0\n\nwhere\n\n1\ns |\u2206|\n\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 s2 /4\nand Ps (\u2206) = \u0398( \u2212\nse\n).\n(22)\n2\nD 2\nD\nIn Ref. [25] it was argued that the average value h|\u2206|i = D/4 was the appropriate value to use in the calculation of FN .\nAlternatively, one could calculate the average of FN with respect to the distribution P(\u2206):\nP(s) =\n\nhFN i =\n\nZ \u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nFN (\u2206)P(\u2206).\n\n(23)\n\nSince \u2206 = \u03b5N \u2212 \u03b5S , Eq. (23) corresponds to an average over the eigenvalues, \u03b5 j , of the GOE Hamiltonian of the\nstatistical model. Thus, while Eq. (23) is related to the ensemble average, Eq. (5), it is not identical with it since\nEq. (5) is an average over the HNN \u2032 , ie. an average over both eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It is clear from Eq. (23)\nthat hFN i depends on the dimensionless variables V /D, \u0393\u0304/D and \u0393S /\u0393N . Both FN (\u2206 = D/4) and hFN i are compared\nwith FN of the statistical model in the next section.\n\nNUMERICAL COMPARISON OF THE MODELS\nThe first thing which may be noted on comparing the statistical model and the two-level model is that they depend\non different dimensionless combinations of the input parameters V , D, \u0393S and \u0393N . The statistical model depends on\n\u0393/\u0393S = 2\u03c0 (V /D)2 (D/\u0393S ) and \u0393N /D while the two-level model depends on V /D, \u0393\u0304/D = (\u0393N /D)(1 + \u0393S /\u0393N )/2 and\n\u0393S /\u0393N . In addition, it may be deduced from Eq. (17) that FN in the two-level model increases monotonically from zero\nto \u0393N /(\u0393S + \u0393N ) as V is varied from zero to infinity whereas in the statistical model FN increases monotonically from\nzero to 1.\nA second difference occurs in the (physically not realized) limit \u0393N /D \u2192 \u221e. In this limit FN in the statistical model\nbecomes independent of \u0393N , being given by [1 + \u0393S /\u0393]\u22121 , cf. Eq. (7). The two-level model in the limit that \u0393\u0304 \u2192 \u221e\nyields FN = \u0393N /(\u0393N + \u0393S )[1 + \u0393N \u0393S /4V 2 )]\u22121 which clearly does not become independent of \u0393N as \u0393N /D \u2192 \u221e.\nIt is useful to note that when a uniform distribution for \u2206 is assumed then\nhFN iU =\n\n1\nD\n\nZ \u221e\n\n2\u03c0 V 2 /D\u0393S\nFN (\u2206)d\u2206 = p\n,\n\u2212\u221e\n1 + 4V 2 /\u0393N \u0393S\n\n(24)\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\ndecay\u2212out intensity\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\nlog10(V/D)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\nlog10(V/D)\n\nFIGURE 3. The figure shows 1\u2212FS (thick solid), hFN i (thin solid), hFN iU (dotted) and FN (\u2206 = D/4) (dashed) versus log10 (V /D),\ncalculated using Eqs. (6), (23), (24) and (17) respectively. The left column has \u0393N /\u0393S = 1000 and the right column has \u0393N /\u0393S = 1.\nThe first, second and third rows have \u0393\u0304/D = 10\u22124 , 0.1 and 10. For FSfl we used Eq. (10) when \u0393\u0304/D = 10\u22124 , 0.1 and Eq. (12) when\n\u0393\u0304/D = 10. The negative values of FN in the first row are due to the fact that Eq. (10) is an approximation to the exact result, Eq. (8).\nEq. (10) also appears to overestimate FSfl in the middle row. Note that hFN i and FN (\u2206 = D/4) coincide in the bottom row.\n\nwhich reduces to \u0393/\u0393S in the limit that V \u226a \u0393N , \u0393S . The limit of small V was considered for the statistical model in\nRef. [20] where a perturbation expansion of Eq. (2) was carried out and the ensemble average of FN calculated: the\nresult is also \u0393/\u0393S .\nIn Fig. 3 where we plot FN versus V /D, the considerations of the preceding paragraph are born out. The graphs in the\nleft hand column were calculated for \u0393N = 1000\u0393S and those in the right hand column for \u0393N = \u0393S . The first, second\nand third rows were calculated for \u0393\u0304/D=10\u22124 , 0.1 and 10 respectively. The dependence on \u0393N /\u0393S is clearly seen in\nthe two-level model as is its absence in the statistical model. Eq. (24) is seen to agree with the statistical model for\nsmall V but to be unphysical for large V . It can also be seen that hFN i and FN (\u2206 = D/4) agree best with the statistical\nmodel when \u0393\u0304/D is small. Indeed, when \u0393N \u226b \u0393S so that the coherence effects present in the two-level model are\nsuppressed and \u0393\u0304 \u226a D then hFN i and FN (\u2206 = D/4) are close to the statistical model for all V /D. It is interesting that\nhFN iU agrees better with statistical model than hFN i when \u0393\u0304 \u226b 1 suggesting that in this region the average over the\nuniform distribution, Eq. (24), corresponds more closely to the ensemble average, Eq. (5), than Eq. (23) does.

Decay-out intensity for the three-level model. The dotted and long dashed curves are the branching ratios for decay\nto the nearest ND state and the next nearest ND state respectively while the thin solid curve is the their sum (see Eq. (25) and the\ndiscussion which follows it). The thick solid and dashed curves are the same as in Fig. 3 (they are the decay-out intensities for the\nmulti-level statistical and two-level models respectively) as are values of \u0393\u0304/D and \u0393N /\u0393S used to plot the curves.\n\ncase \u0393\u0304/D = 10\u22124 , \u0393N /\u0393S = 1000 shown in Fig. 3 is representative of the mass 190 region. The considerations in the\npresent contribution thus go some way to explaining why the values of V extracted [33] from experimental data in the\nmass 190 region using the statistical model and those extracted using the two-level model were very similar.\nIn Ref. [25] the validity of the two-level model was investigated by calculating the decay-out intensity for a threelevel model where the decaying SD state is allowed to decay to the nearest neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor ND\nstates. The decay-out intensity may be written\n(3)\n\nFN =\n\n2\n\n\u2211 Fj ,\n\nj=1\n\nFj =\n\n\u0393N\n2\u03c0\n\nZ \u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndE|G jS (E)|2 ,\n\n(25)\n(3)\n\nwhere G jS denotes the Green's function of Eq. (2) in the basis of eigenvectors, | ji, of HNN \u2032 . Clearly, FN depends on\n\u22061 and \u22062 , the relative energies of the two ND states and on V1 and V2 , their interactions with the SD state. In Ref. [25]\na probability distribution for \u22062 similar to Eq. (21) was assumed resulting in the average value h\u22062 i = 3D/4.\n\n\f(3)\n\nIn Fig. 4 we compare FN of the multi-level statistical model and FN (\u2206 = D/4) of the two-level model with FN ,\nF1 and F2 for \u22061 = D/4, \u22062 = 3D/4 and V1 = V2 = V . In similarity to two-level case, the effects of coherence are\n(3)\n(3)\npronounced in FN when \u0393N = \u0393S . It can be seen that FN moves in the direction of FN relative to FN (\u2206 = D/4). (As\nmentioned in the caption to Fig. 3, FN appears to be underestimated in the middle row due to use of the approximate\n(n)\n(3)\nEq. (10).) We expect that FN calculated analogously to FN would rapidly approach FN with increasing n. The fact\n(3)\nthat FN and FN (\u2206 = D/4) are barely distinguishable for the case \u0393\u0304/D = 10\u22124 , \u0393N /\u0393S = 1000 again suggests that the\ntwo-level model is adequate to describe the SD decay in the mass 190 region. It would be interesting to calculate the\n(3)\naverage of FN over \u22061 and \u22062 in analogy to Eqs. (23) and (24).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have compared a multi-level statistical model and a two-level model of the decay out of a superdeformed band\nwith each other. We conclude that while the models depend on different dimensionless combinations of the input\nparameters and yield different results for certain limiting cases, they essentially agree in the cases where experimental\ndata are available. However, this conclusion does not mean that we have reached a fully satisfactory description of the\ndecay-out of superdeformed bands. The two-level model and multi-level statistical model level quite naturally only\nagree in the parameter regime where there are just two well defined levels interacting. However, this agreement, as it is\ndescribed in the preceding section, surely has much to do with the use of the GOE probability distribution to calculate\nthe ensemble average in Eq. (5) and the use of the Wigner nearest neighbor spacing distribution in obtaining Eq. (21)\nfor the probability distribution of \u2206. The use of these two intimately related distributions to account for the unknown\nparameters of the respective formulations means that level fluctuations must be equally important in the two-level and\nmultilevel statistical models. Consequently, the respective values of V which can be extracted from the experimental\nFN using the two models appear to be subject to similar errors. An analytical calculation of the variance of FN , based\non either model, which is valid in the physically realized region would be useful in assessing the errors.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank D. M.
