Bekshaev\nI.I. Mechnikov National University, Dvoryanska 2, Odessa 65082, Ukraine\nbekshaev@onu.edu.ua\nThe transverse beam pattern, usually observed in experiment, is a result of averaging the\noptical-frequency oscillations of the electromagnetic field distributed over the beam cross\nsection. An analytical criterion is derived that these oscillations are coupled with a sort of\nrotation around the beam axis. This criterion appears to be in direct relation with the usual\ndefinition of the beam orbital angular momentum.\n\nOCIS codes: 070.2580, 080.4865, 140.3295, 260.6042\nLight beams carrying the mechanical orbital angular momentum (OAM) with respect to the\npropagation axis attract great attention due to their unique physical properties and promising\napplications [1\u20134]. The question of physical origin of the vortex properties of such beams is\ninteresting and insistent [3\u201312]. In attempts to answer it, researchers have employed the momentary\npatterns of the light field behaviour during a cycle of oscillation [3, 4]. It was found that, in contrast\nto usual (non-vortex) beams where the evolution of the momentary transverse field distribution\nconsists in periodical change of the field strength synchronously over the whole beam cross section,\nin the \"classical\" vortex beams (circular Laguerre-Gaussian modes) the momentary distribution of\nthe electric field rotates with the field oscillation frequency (see Fig. 1a which illustrates the same\nbehaviour as Fig. 10 of [3]).\n\n\f2\nHowever, this explanation of vortex properties of light beams does not seem satisfactory.\nFirst, the rate of the momentary pattern rotation of the sort depicted in Fig. 1a falls down for higherorder LG modes [4,10], whose vortex properties seem to be \"stronger\". Second, some classes of\nbeams with OAM apparently show no rotation of the instantaneous field distribution, for example,\nrotating Gaussian beams with mismatching symmetries of the amplitude and phase profiles [7\u20139]\nwhose momentary transverse patterns are presented in Fig. 1b. And, at last, this reasoning is based\non the intuitive interpretation of the time evolution depicted in Fig. 1 which can be uncertain; it is\nessentially qualitative and needs a reliable quantitative foundation.\nIn this Letter, we intend (i) to derive a natural unambiguous analytical criterion for presence\nof the rotational component in the momentary beam pattern evolution and (ii) to show close\nrelations of this criterion with usual definition of the beam OAM.\nConsider a paraxial light beam propagating along axis z ; transverse cross section is\nparameterized by coordinates ( x, y ) \u2261 r . We use a scalar model of the beam in which it can be\ncharacterized by the electric field component depending on the spatial coordinates and the time in\naccord with equation [3,4]\n\nE ( r, z, t ) = u ( r, z ) exp \u23a1\u23a3i ( kz \u2212 \u03c9t ) \u23a4\u23a6\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the cyclic frequency of radiation, k is its wave vector ( \u03c9 = ck in a medium with the\nlight velocity c ) and u ( r, z ) is the slowly varying complex amplitude. Our further consideration\nwill relate to a fixed cross section and, since it is always possible to choose the reference frame so\nthat in this section z = 0 , from now on, explicit indication of the longitudinal coordinate z will be\nomitted. Eq. (1) is a complex representation of a harmonically oscillating field; the true instant field\ndistribution at any time moment is determined by expression [13]\n\nE ( r, t ) = Re \u23a1\u23a3E ( r, t ) \u23a4\u23a6 .\n\n(2)\n\n\f3\nIntroducing the real module A ( r ) and phase \u03c6 ( r ) of the complex amplitude in accord with\nequation\n\nu ( r ) = A ( r ) exp \u23a1\u23a3ik \u03c6 ( r ) \u23a4\u23a6\n\n(3)\n\nthe instant field (2) can be written in the form\n\nE ( r, t ) = A ( r ) cos \u23a1\u23a3 k \u03c6 ( r ) \u2212 \u03c9t \u23a4\u23a6 .\n\n(4)\n\nThis equation describes behaviour of the momentary field distribution discussed in this\nLetter. In special cases of circular Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, A ( r ) \u2261 A ( r ) , k \u03c6 ( r ) = l \u03c6 where\n\nr = x 2 + y 2 , \u03c6 = arctan ( y x ) are the polar coordinates the transverse cross section, and l is the\ninteger mode index. Then\nE ( r, t ) = A ( r ) cos ( l \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c9t )\n\n(5)\n\nso the rotation of the instant beam pattern is seen evidently (Fig. 1a). In many other typical\nsituations the temporal behaviour of the field (4) represents a complicated oscillatory behaviour\nwith local phases and amplitudes varying in different points, so one cannot tell \"by eye\" is there any\nrotational component in this motion or not.\nWe can try to find an analytical criterion for the presence of certain rotational component in\nthe given oscillatory pattern. Let us note that for the case of \"pure\" rotation (5)\n\n\u2202E ( r, t )\n\u03c9 \u2202E ( r, t )\n=\u2212\n.\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c6\nl\n\n(6)\n\nThis establishes an exact correspondence between temporal and azimuthal derivatives of the instant\nfield pattern. It could be expected that in more complicated cases, when Eq. (6) takes no place,\n\n\f4\ncertain correlation between the expressions standing in right and left parts of (6) can be a measure\nof presence of the sought rotational component.\nSo, the criterion that the instant field in the beam cross section shows a sort of rotational\nmotion can be formulated as\n\n\u2202E ( r, t ) \u2202E ( r, t )\n\u2202E ( r, t ) \u2202E ( r, t )\n\u221d E\u03c6t = \u222b\n( dr ) dt \u2260 0\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202t\n\n(7)\n\nwhere integration is performed over the whole cross section ( ( dr ) = dxdy is the element of area) and\nover the oscillation period. Integral E\u03c6t in (7) is a usual measure of correlation between \u2202E \u2202\u03c6\nand \u2202E \u2202t and can be considered as a general \"instant rotation criterion\" (IRC). To avoid the\ndependence on the beam intensity, its expression (7) must be supplemented by due normalization\nprocedure including mean values of the correlated quantities, i.e. integrals\n\u239b \u2202E ( r, t ) \u239e\n= \u222b\u239c\n\u239f ( dr ) dt ,\n\u239d \u2202t \u23a0\n2\n\nEt2\n\n\u239b \u2202E ( r, t ) \u239e\n= \u222b\u239c\n\u239f ( dr ) dt\n\u239d \u2202\u03c6 \u23a0\n2\n\nE\u03c62\n\n(8)\n\nwhich lead to the definition of a correlation coefficient (normalized IRC)\n\nE\u03c6t\n\nB=\u2212\nEt2\n\n12\n\nE\u03c62\n\n12\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nNegative sign in (9) makes the coefficient B positive for the LG modes (5) when, in fact, perfect\nnegative correlation takes place due to (6). For the prototype beam (5), the value B = 1 looks an\nadequate expression for the \"perfect\" rotational properties of the LG beam instant pattern.\nNow consider expressions (7) \u2013 (9) with allowance for general definitions (3) and (4). Then\n\n\u2202E ( r ) \u2202A ( r )\n\u2202\u03c6 ( r )\n=\ncos \u23a1\u23a3 k \u03c6 ( r ) \u2212 \u03c9t \u23a4\u23a6 \u2212 A ( r ) k sin \u23a1\u23a3 k \u03c6 ( r ) \u2212 \u03c9t \u23a4\u23a6\n,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n\f5\n\u2202E ( r )\n= A ( r ) \u03c9 sin \u23a1\u23a3 k \u03c6 ( r ) \u2212 \u03c9t \u23a4\u23a6 ,\n\u2202t\n\nand calculations of (7), (8) are simplified because when integrating over the oscillation period\nsquares of sines and cosines give the same value \u03c0 \u03c9 while their products give zeros. After\nsubstitution into (7) and (8) one obtains\n\nE\u03c6t = \u2212k \u03c0 \u222b A2 ( r )\n\nE\u03c62\n\n\u2202\u03c6 ( r )\n( dr ) ,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\nEt2 = \u03c9\u03c0 \u222b A ( r ) ( dr ) ,\n2\n\n2\n2\n\u239b \u2202\u03c6 ( r ) \u239e \u23a4\n\u03c0 \u23a1\u239b \u2202A ( r ) \u239e\n2 2\n= \u222b \u23a2\u239c\n\u239f + k A (r ) \u239c\n\u239f \u23a5 ( dr ) .\n\u03c9 \u23a2\u239d \u2202\u03c6 \u23a0\n\u2202\u03c6 \u23a0 \u23a5\n\u239d\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nNote that although the characteristics of instantaneous field pattern are now considered, their\nexpressions (9) \u2013 (11) are represented through parameters of the complex amplitude (3), describing\nthe usually observed time-averaged beam.\nLook at the most important term \u2013 numerator of Eq. (9) represented by the first Eq. (10).\nComparison with known formulas of [1,4,5,8] tells that it is proportional to the beam angular\nmomentum (OAM); to be exact, if the electric field is given by (1),\n\nE\u03c6t = \u22128\u03c02\u03c9L\n\n(12)\n\nwhere L is the linear density of the beam OAM [1,4]. This is a central point of this Letter: the\ncorrelation coefficients (7), (9), which indicate presence of the rotational component in momentary\nvariation of the transverse beam pattern, appear to be in the direct relation with the usual measure of\nthe beam OAM. So, the vortex properties of the beam that are seen in very large, compared to the\nlight oscillations, time scales, are directly linked to the momentary rotational transformations of the\ntransverse beam pattern during the oscillation period. Any vortex behaviour of the time-averaged\n\n\f6\nbeam has its origin in this momentary rotation, despite that this rotation is a sort of \"sunlight spot\"\nand has no direct mechanical meaning [10,11] and even when the rotational component of\noscillations is not intuitively obvious, as, for example, in case of rotating Gaussian beams (Fig. 1b).\nReciprocally, in any beam with OAM, the instantaneous transverse energy distribution\nE ( r, t ) shows a sort of rotational motion in the sense of (7), (9).\n\nThe IRC (9) provides a quantitative expression of this conclusion but this is not the only\npossible choice. In particular, in accord with Eqs. (1) \u2013 (3), the second Eq. (10) leads to\nrepresentation Et2 = 8\u03c02 k \u03a6 where \u03a6 = ( c 8\u03c0 ) \u222b A2 ( r )( dr ) is the total energy flow (power) of the\nbeam [4,8]. Then, if we replace the second term in the denominator of (9) by the first one and\nmultiply the whole expression by \u03c9, with taking Eq. (12) into account we obtain another form of the\nIRC\n\n\u039b = \u2212\u03c9\n\nE\u03c6t\nEt2\n\n= \u03c9c\n\nL\n\u03a6\n\n(13)\n\nwhich completely coincides with the normalized (specific) OAM [4] and is a measure of the beam\nOAM in units \" = per photon\" [4,5]. One more useful form of the IRC is formulated similarly:\n\n\u03a9=\u2212\n\nE\u03c6t\n\u03c9 E\u03c62\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nIts application to the case of \"pure\" rotation (5), (6) shows that this amount has the meaning of\neffective angular velocity of the momentary pattern rotation measured in units of \u03c9 .\n\n\f7\n\nReferences\n1.
