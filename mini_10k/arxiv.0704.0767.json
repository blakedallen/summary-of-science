Overview\nMicrolensing is a proven extrasolar planet search method that has already yielded the detection of four exoplanets. These detections have changed our understanding of planet\nformation \"beyond the snowline\" by demonstrating that Neptune-mass planets with separations of several AU are common. Microlensing is sensitive to planets that are generally\ninaccessible to other methods, in particular cool planets at or beyond the snowline, very\nlow-mass (i.e. terrestrial) planets, planets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets, and\neven planets in external galaxies. Such planets can provide critical constraints on models\nof planet formation, and therefore the next generation of extrasolar planet searches should\ninclude an aggressive and well-funded microlensing component. When combined with the\nresults from other complementary surveys, next generation microlensing surveys can yield an\naccurate and complete census of the frequency and properties of planets, and in particular\nlow-mass terrestrial planets. Such a census provides a critical input for the design of direct\nimaging experiments.\nMicrolensing planet searches can be carried out from either the ground or space. Here we\nfocus on the former, and leave the discussion of space-based surveys for a separate paper.\nWe review the microlensing method and its properties, and then outline the potential of\nnext generation ground-based microlensing surveys. Detailed models of such surveys have\nalready been carried out, and the first steps in constructing the required network of 1-2m\nclass telescopes with wide FOV instruments are being taken. However, these steps are\nprimarily being taken by other countries, and if the US is to remain competitive, it must\ncommit resources to microlensing surveys in the relatively near future.\n2. The Properties of Microlensing Planet Searches\nIf a foreground star (\"lens\") becomes closely aligned with a more distant star (\"source\"), it\nbends the source light into two images. The resulting magnification is a monotonic function of\nthe projected separation. For Galactic stars, the image sizes and separations are of order \u03bcas\nand mas respectively, so they are generally not resolved. Rather \"microlensing events\" are\nrecognized from their time-variable magnification (Paczynski 1986), which typically occurs\non timescales tE of months, although it ranges from days to years in extreme cases. Presently\nabout 600 microlensing events are discovered each year, almost all toward the Galactic bulge.\nIf one of these images passes close to a planetary companion of the lens star, it further\n1\n\nDepartment of Astronomy, The Ohio State University, 140 W. 18th Ave., Columbus, OH 43210, USA\n\n2\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nperturbs the image\n\u221a and so changes the magnification. Because the range of gravitational\naction scalesp\u221d M , where M is the mass of the lens, the planetary perturbation typically\nlasts tp \u223c tE mp /M, where mp is the planet mass. That is, tp \u223c 1 day for Jupiters and tp \u223c\n1.5 hours for Earths. Hence, planets are discovered by intensive, round-the-clock photometric\nmonitoring of ongoing microlensing events (Mao & Paczynski 1991; Gould & Loeb 1992)\n2.1 Sensitivity of Microlensing\nWhile, in principle, microlensing can detect planets of any mass and separation, orbiting\nstars of any mass and distance from the Sun, the characteristics of microlensing favor some\nregimes of parameter space.\n\u2022 Sensitivity to Low-mass Planets: Compared to other techniques, microlensing is more\nsensitive to low-mass planets. This is because the amplitude of the perturbation does not decline as the planet mass declines, at least until mass goes below that of Mars (Bennett & Rhie\n\u221a\n1996). The duration does decline as mp (so higher cadence is required for small planets)\n\u221a\nand the probability of a perturbation also declines as mp (so more stars must be monitored), but if a signal is detected, its magnitude is typically large ( & 10%), and so easily\ncharacterized and unambiguous.\n\u2022 Sensitivity to Planets Beyond the Snowline: Because microlensing works by perturbing images, it is most sensitive to planets that lie at projected distances where the images\nare the\np largest. This so-called \"lensing zone\" lies within a factor of 1.6 of the Einstein ring,\nrE = (4GM/c2 )Ds x(1 \u2212 x), where x = Dl /Ds and Dl and Ds are the distances to the lens\nand source. At the Einstein ring, the equilibrium temperature is\n\u0010 L \u00111/4 \u0010 r \u0011\u22121/2\nM\nE\nTE = T\u2295\n\u2192 70 K\n[4x(1 \u2212 x)]1/4\n(1)\nL\u2299\nAU\n0.5 M\u2299\nwhere we have adopted a simple model for lens luminosity L \u221d M 5 , and assumed Ds =\n8 kpc. Hence, microlensing is primarily sensitive to planets in temperature zones similar to\nJupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune.\n\u2022 Sensitivity to Free Floating Planets: Because the microlensing effect arises directly\nfrom the planet mass, the existence of a host star is not required for detection. Thus, microlensing maintains significant sensitivity at arbitrarily large separations, and in particular\nis the only method that is sensitive to old, free-floating planets. See \u00a7 4.\n\u2022 Sensitivity to Planets from 1 kpc to M31: Microlensing searches require dense star\nfields and so are best carried out against the Galactic bulge, which is 8 kpc away. Given that\nthe Einstein radius peaks at x = 1/2, it is most sensitive to planets that are 4 kpc away, but\nmaintains considerable sensitivity provided the lens is at least 1 kpc from both the observer\nand the source. Hence, microlensing is about equally sensitive to planets in the bulge and\ndisk of the Milky Way. However, specialized searches are also sensitive to closer planets and\nto planets in other galaxies, particularly M31. See \u00a7 5.\n\u2022 Sensitivity to Planets Orbiting a Wide Range of Host Stars: Microlensing is about\nequally sensitive to planets independent of host luminosity, i.e., planets of stars all along the\nmain sequence, from G to M, as well as white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. By contrast, other\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ntechniques are generally challenged to detect planets around low-luminosity hosts.\n\u2022 Sensitivity to Multiple Planet Systems: In general, the probability of detecting two\nplanets (even if they are present) is the square of the probability of finding one, which\nmeans it is usually very small. However, for high-magnification events, the planet-detection\nprobability is close to unity (Griest & Safizadeh 1998), and so its square is also near unity\n(Gaudi et al. 1998). In certain rare cases, microlensing can also detect the moon of a planet\n(Bennett & Rhie 2002).\n2.2 Planet and Host Star Characterization\nMicrolensing fits routinely return the planet/star mass ratio q = mp /M and the projected\nseparation in units of the Einstein radius b = r\u22a5 /rE (Gaudi & Gould 1997). Historically, it\nwas believed that, for the majority of microlensing discoveries, it would be difficult to obtain\nadditional information about the planet or the host star beyond measurements of q and b.\nThis is because of the well-known difficulty that the routinely-measured timescale tE is a\ndegenerate combination of M, Dl , and the velocity of the lens. In this regime, individual\nconstraints on these parameters must rely on a Bayesian analysis incorporating priors derived\nfrom a Galactic model (e.g., Dong et al. 2006).\nExperience with the actual detections has demonstrated that the original view was likely\nshortsighted, and that one can routinely expect improved constraints on the mass of the\nhost and planet. In three of the four microlensing events yielding exoplanet detections, the\neffect of the angular size of the source was imprinted on the light curve, thus enabling a\nmeasurement of the angular size of the Einstein radius \u03b8E = rE /Dl . This constrains the\nstatistical estimate of M and Dl (and so mp and r\u22a5 ). In hindsight, one can expect this to be\na generic outcome. Furthermore, it is now clear that for a substantial fraction of events, the\nlens light can be detected during and after the event, allowing photometric mass and distance\nestimates, and so reasonable estimates of mp and r\u22a5 (Bennett et al. 2007). By waiting\nsufficiently long (usually 2 to 20 years) one could use space telescopes or adaptive optics to\nsee the lens separating from the source, even if the lens is faint. Such an analysis has already\nbeen used the constrain the mass of the host star of the first microlensing planet discovery\n(Bennett et al. 2006), and similar constraints for several of the remaining discoveries are\nforthcoming. Finally, in special cases it may also be possible to obtain information about\nthe three-dimensional orbits of the discovered planets.\n3. Present-Day Microlensing Searches\nMicrolensing searches today still basically carry out the approach advocated by Gould & Loeb\n(1992): Two international networks of astronomers intensively follow up ongoing microlensing events that are discovered by two other groups that search for events. The one major\nmodification is that, following the suggestion of Griest & Safizadeh (1998), they try to focus\non the highest magnification events, which are the most sensitive to planets. Monitoring is\ndone with 1m (and smaller) class telescopes. Indeed, because the most sensitive events are\nhighly magnified, amateurs, with telescopes as small as 0.25m, play a major role.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- (Left) Known extrasolar planets detected via transits (blue), RV (red), and\nmicrolensing (green), as a function of their mass and equilibrium temperature. (Right)\nSame as the right panel, but versus semimajor axis. The contours show the number of\ndetections per year from a NextGen microlensing survey.\nTo date, four secure planets have been detected, all with equilibrium temperatures 40 K <\nT < 70 K. Two are Jupiter class planets and so are similar to the planets found by RV\nat these temperatures (Bond et al. 2004; Udalski et al. 2005). However, two are Neptune\nmass planets, which are an order of magnitude lighter than planets detected by RV at these\ntemperatures (Beaulieu et al. 2006; Gould et al. 2006). See Figure 1. This emphasizes the\nmain advantages that microlensing has over other methods in this parameter range. The\nmain disadvantage is simply that relatively few planets have been detected despite a huge\namount of work.\n4. NextGen Microlensing Searches\nNext-generation microlensing experiments will operate on completely different principles\nfrom those at present, which survey large sections of the Galactic bulge one\u2013few times per\nnight and then intensively monitor a handful of the events that are identified. Instead, widefield (\u223c 4 deg2 ) cameras on 2m telescopes on 3\u20134 continents will monitor large (\u223c 10 deg2 )\nareas of the bulge once every 10 minutes around-the-clock. The higher cadence will find\n6000 events per year instead of 600. More important: all 6000 events will automatically be\nmonitored for planetary perturbations by the search survey itself, as opposed to roughly 50\nevents monitored per year as at present. These two changes will yield a roughly 100-fold\nincrease in the number of events probed and so in the number of planetary detections.\nTwo groups (led respectively by Scott Gaudi and Dave Bennett) have carried out detailed\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Expectations from a NextGen ground-based microlensing survey. These results\nrepresent the average of two independent simulations which include very different input\nassumptions but differ in their predictions by only \u223c 0.3 dex. (Left) Number of planets\ndetected per year assuming every main-sequence (MS) star has a planet of a given mass and\nsemi-major axis (see \u00a74). (Right) Same as left panel, but assuming every MS has two planets\ndistributed uniformly in log(a) between 0.4-20 AU. The arrows indicate the masses of the\nfour microlensing exoplanet detections.\nsimulations of such a survey, taking account of variable seeing and weather conditions as\nwell as photometry systematics, and including a Galactic model that matches all known\nconstraints. While these two independent simulations differ in detail, they come to similar\nconclusions. Figure 1 shows the number of planets detected assuming all main-sequence\nstars have a planet of a given mass and given semi-major axis. While, of course, all stars\ndo not have planets at all these different masses, Gould et al. (2006) have shown that the\ntwo \"cold Neptunes\" detected by microlensing imply that roughly a third of stars have such\nplanets in the \"lensing zone\", i.e. the region most sensitive for microlensing searches.\nMicrolensing sensitivity does decline at separations that are larger than the Einstein radius,\nbut then levels to a plateau, which remains constant even into the regime of free-floating\nplanets. In this case, the timescales are similar to those of bound-planet perturbations (1 day\nfor Jupiters, 1.5 hours for Earths) but there is no \"primary event\". Again, typical amplitudes\nare factor of a few, which makes them easily recognizable.\nIf every star ejected f planets of\np\nmass mp , the event rate would be \u0393 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 f mp /Mj yr\u22121 per monitored star. Since\nNextGen experiments will monitor 10s of millions of stars for integrated times of well over\na year, this population will easily be detected unless f is very small. Microlensing is the\nonly known way of detecting (old) free-floating planets, which may be a generic outcome of\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nplanet formation (Goldreich et al. 2004; Juric & Tremaine 2007; Ford & Rasio 2007).\n4.1 Transition to Next Generation\nAlthough NextGen microlensing experiments will work on completely different principles,\nthe transition is actually taking place step by step. The Japanese/New Zealand group MOA\nalready has a 2 deg2 camera in place on their 1.8m NZ telescope and monitors about 4 deg2\nevery 10 minutes, while covering a much wider area every hour. The OGLE team has\nfunds from the Polish government to replace their current 0.4 deg2 camera on their 1.3m\ntelescope in Chile with a 1.7 deg2 camera. When finished, they will also densely monitor\nseveral square degrees while monitoring a much larger area once per night. Astronomers in\nKorea and Germany have each made comprehensive proposals to their governments to build\na major new telescope/camera in southern Africa, which would enable virtually round-theclock monitoring of several square degrees. Chinese astronomers are considering a similar\ninitiative. In the meantime, intensive followup of the currently surveyed fields is continuing.\n5. Other Microlensing Planet Searches\nWhile microlensing searches are most efficiently carried out toward the Galactic bulge, there\nare two other frontiers that microlensing can broach over the next decade or so.\n\u2022 Extragalactic Planets: Microlensing searches of M31 are not presently sensitive to planets, but could be with relatively minor modifications. M31's greater distance implies that\nonly more luminous (hence physically larger) sources can give rise to detectable microlensing\nevents. To generate substantial magnification, the planetary Einstein ring must be larger\nthan the source, which generally implies that Jupiters are detectable, but Neptunes (or\nEarths) are not (Covone et al. 2000; Baltz & Gondolo 2001). Nevertheless, it is astonishing\nthat extragalactic planets are detectable at all. To probe for M31 planets, M31 microlensing\nevents must be detected in real time, and then must trigger intensive followup observations of the type currently carried out toward the Galactic bulge, but with larger telescopes\n(Chung et al. 2006). This capability is well within reach.\n\u2022 Nearby microlensing events: In his seminal paper on microlensing, Einstein (1936)\nfamously dismissed the possibility that it would ever be observed because the event rate\nfor the bright stars visible in his day was too small. Nevertheless, a Japanese amateur\nrecently discovered such a \"domestic microlensing event\" (DME) of a bright (V \u223c 11.4),\nnearby (\u223c 1 kpc) star, which was then intensively monitored by other amateurs (organized\nby Columbia professor Joe Patterson). While intensive observations began too late to detect\nplanets, Gaudi et al. (2007) showed that more timely observations would have been sensitive\nto an Earth-mass planet orbiting the lens. In contrast to more distant lenses, DME lenses\nwould usually be subject to followup observations, including RV. This would open a new\ndomain in microlensing planet searches. Virtually all such DMEs could be found with two\n\"fly's eye\" telescopes, one in each hemisphere, which would combine 120 10 cm cameras on a\nsingle mount to simultaneously monitor the \u03c0 steradians above airmass 2 to V = 15. A fly's\neye telescope would have many other applications including an all-sky search for transiting\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nplanets and a 3-day warning system for Tunguska-type impactors. Each would cost \u223c$4M.\n6. Conclusion and Outlook\nIn our own solar system, the equilibrium-temperature range probed by microlensing (out\npast the \"snow line\") is inhabited by four planets, two gas giants and two ice giants. All\nhave similar-sized ice-rock cores and differ primarily in the amount of gas they have accreted.\nSystematic study of this region around other stars would test predictive models of planet\nformation (e.g. Ida & Lin 2004) by determining whether smaller cores (incapable of accreting\ngas) also form. Such a survey would give clues as to why cores that reach critical gas-grabbing\nsize do or do not actually manage to accrete gas, and if so, how much. In the inner parts of\nthis region, RV probes the gas giants but not the ice giants nor, of course, terrestrial planets.\nRV cannot make reliable measurements in the outer part of this region at all because the\nperiods are too long. Future astrometry missions (such as SIM) could probe the inner regions\ndown to terrestrial masses, but are also limited by their limited lifetime in the outer regions.\nHence, microlensing is uniquely suited to a comprehensive study of this region.\nAlthough microlensing searches have so far detected only a handful of planets, these have\nalready changed our understanding of planet formation \"beyond the snowline\". Next generation microlensing surveys, which would be sensitive to dozens of \"cold Earths\" in this\nregion, are well advanced in design conception and are starting initial practical implementation. These surveys play an additional crucial role as proving grounds for a space-based\nmicrolensing survey, the results of which are likely to completely revolutionize our understanding of planets over a very broad range of masses, separations, and host star masses (see\nthe Bennett et al. ExoPTF white paper).\nTraditionally, US astronomers have played a major role in microlensing planet searches.\nFor example, Bohdan Paczy\u0144ski at Princeton essentially founded the entire field (Paczynski\n1986) and co-started OGLE. Half a dozen US theorists have all contributed key ideas and led\nthe analysis of planetary events. The Ohio State and Notre Dame groups have played key\nroles in inaugurating and sustaining the follow-up teams that made 3 of the 4 microlensing\nplanet detections possible.\nNevertheless, it must be frankly stated that the field is increasingly dominated by other\ncountries, often with GDPs that are 5\u201310% of the US GDP, for the simple reason that they\nare outspending the US by a substantial margin. There are simply no programs that would\nprovide the $5\u2013$10M required to be in the NextGen microlensing game. If US astronomers\nstill are in this game at all, it is because of the strong intellectual heritage that we bring,\naugmented by the practical observing programs that we initiated when the entire subject\nwas being run on a shoestring. These historical advantages will quickly disappear as the\nnext generation of students is trained on NextGen experiments, somewhere else.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nREFERENCES\nBaltz, E.
