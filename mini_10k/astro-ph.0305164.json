Infall of baryonic gas toward sheets, filaments and knots, as well as supersonic flows associated with hierarchical clustering, induce shocks (see, e.g., Quilis et al. 1998; Miniati et al. 2000; Miniati 2002;\nGabici & Blasi 2003). Those cosmological shock waves, like most astrophysical shocks, are\n\"collisionless\" features mediated by collective, electromagnetic viscosities. Such viscosities\nrely on irregular magnetic field components, i.e., MHD wave turbulence that is self-excited\nby the streaming suprathermal particles produced during shock formation (see, e.g., Wentzel\n1974; Kennel et al. 1985; Quest 1988).\nThe existence and character of these shocks is important for several reasons. Through\ndissipation the cosmological shock waves convert part of the gravitational energy associated\nwith structure formation into heat and, thus, govern the gas thermal history in the universe.\nThermal energy is then radiated away, manifesting the large scale structure as well as the\ndynamics that created it (see, e.g., Cen & Ostriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001). At the same\ntime, due to incomplete plasma thermalization at collisionless shocks, a sizeable portion of\nthe shock energy can be converted into cosmic ray (CR) energy (mostly ionic) via diffusive\nshock acceleration (DSA) (for reviews, see, e.g., Blandford & Eichler 1987; Malkov & Drury\n2001). This nonthermal population represents a small fraction of the ion flux through a\ncollisionless shock that leaks back upstream to become subject to DSA; that is, to be \"injected\" into the nonthermal population. Numerous nonlinear studies of DSA have shown\nthat substantial fractions of the energy flux through strong shocks can be captured by the\nnonthermal populations (e.g., Berezhko et al. 1995; Ellison et al. 1996; Malkov 1999; Kang\net al. 2002). Extensive nonlinear simulations by some of us incorporating a plasma-physicsbased \"thermal leakage\" injection model into combined gas dynamic/CR diffusion-convection\nsimulations found that strong shocks transfer up to \u223c 1/2 of the initial shock kinetic energy\nto CRs by this process (Kang et al. 2002; Kang & Jones 2002).\nThere is clear evidence that one or more processes energize significant nonthermal particle populations in and around cosmic structures. A number of clusters have been found with\ndiffuse synchrotron radio halos or/and radio relic sources, indicating the existence of relativistic electron populations in intracluster medium (ICM) (see, e.g., Giovannini & Feretti\n2000; Feretti 2003). In addition, some clusters have been reported to possess excess EUV\nand/or hard X-ray radiation compared to that expected from the hot, thermal X-ray emitting\nICM, most likely produced by inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background\nradiation (CMBR) photons by CR electrons (see, e.g., Lieu et al. 1996; Fusco-Femiano et\nal. 1999). Also it has been suggested that a fraction of the diffuse \u03b3-ray background radia-\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ntion could originate from the same process (Loeb & Waxmann 2000; Miniati 2002; Scharf &\nMukherjee 2002). If some of those CR electrons have been energized at cosmological shock\nwaves, the same process should have produced greater CR proton populations. Hence, although CR protons in the ICM have yet to be confirmed by the observation of \u03b3-ray photons\nproduced by inelastic collisions between CR and thermal-gas protons (see, e.g., Miniati et\nal. 2001b; Reimer et al. 2003), there may very well exist CR proton populations there whose\npressure is comparable to the gas thermal pressure (Ensslin et al. 1997; Colafrancesco & Blasi\n1998; Lieu et al. 1999).\nThe properties of cosmological shock waves in the large scale structure of the universe\nwere analyzed quantitatively by Miniati et al. (2000) using numerical simulations with 2703\ngrid zones in a cubic comoving region of size 85h\u22121 Mpc for a SCDM model and a \u039bCDM\nmodel. They identified accretion shocks, merger shocks and internal flow shocks which were\nformed by infall and hierarchical clustering, and showed that the topology of these shocks is\nvery complex. They found merger and internal flow shocks distributed over Mach numbers\nfrom 3 to 10 with a peak at M \u223c 5 and accretion shock Mach numbers ranging between 10\nand a few \u00d7103 . In a recent study based on a higher resolution simulation with 5123 grid\nzones in a cubic comoving region of size 50h\u22121 Mpc for a \u039bCDM model, Miniati (2002) showed\nthat most dissipation involves shocks of modest strength, with 4 . M . 10 accounting for\n\u223c 45% of total shock heating. On the other hand, through a semi-analytic study Gabici &\nBlasi (2003) found a Mach number distribution of merger-related shocks during large scale\nstructure formation with a peak at much lower Mach number (M . 1.5).\nIn this paper, we critically re-examine the properties of cosmological shock waves with\na new set of cosmic structure formation simulations. We quantify the characteristics of cosmological shock waves and estimate the dissipation, gas thermalization and CR acceleration\nat those shocks. The capture of shocks in hydrodynamic simulations and the identification of shocks in such simulation data are affected by numerical details including resolution.\nTherefore, to validate our findings we estimate the errors in our measured quantities through\nconsistency checks and resolution convergence tests. This study adds valuable insights into\nthe thermal history and nature of gas in the universe, as well as nonthermal activities in the\nICM. In \u00a72, simulations are detailed along with shock identification. The main results of\nshock characteristics and shock dissipation are described in \u00a73 and \u00a74, respectively, followed\nby a summary in \u00a75.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.\n2.1.\n\nNumerics\nSimulations\n\nThe cold dark matter cosmology with a cosmological constant (\u039bCDM) was employed\nwith the following parameters: \u03a9BM = 0.043, \u03a9DM = 0.227, and \u03a9\u039b = 0.73, h \u2261 H0 /(100\nkm/s/Mpc) = 0.7, and \u03c38 = 0.8. The above values are consistent with those fitted with\nthe recent WMAP data (see, e.g., Bennett et al. 2003). A cubic region of comoving size\n100h\u22121 Mpc was simulated inside a computational box with 10243 , 5123, 2563 , 1283 and\n643 grid zones for gas and gravity and 5123 , 2563 , 1283 , 643 and 323 particles for dark\nmatter. It allows a uniform spatial resolution of \u2206l = 97.7h\u22121 kpc \u2212 1.57h\u22121 Mpc. The\nsimulations were performed using a PM/Eulerian hydrodynamic cosmology code. The code\nis described in Ryu et al. (1993). But the version of the code used includes several updates.\nFor instance, it now adopts the MC (monotonized central difference) limiter, instead of the\noriginal minmod limiter. The update to the MC limiter was intended to enhance the density\nresolution and to capture shocks more sharply (see, e.g., LeVeque 1997, for details).\nWe did not include in our simulations several physical processes such as radiative cooling,\ngalaxy/star formation, feedback from galaxies and stars, that can play significant roles in\ndetermining conditions within cluster cores, nor reionization of the intergalactic medium that\neffectively sets a temperature floor to the IGM. Our primary goal is to study cosmological\nshocks which are mostly outside cluster core regions. We established a temperature floor as\na part of our analysis procedure. The conclusions drawn in this study, hence, should not be\nsignificantly weakened by the exclusion of those additional physical processes.\n\n2.2.\n\nShock Identification\n\nWhile shocks are automatically detected during the simulations by the Riemann solver\nwithin the hydrodynamics routine, there are additional steps necessary to identify and characterize shocks for analysis. We have done this as a post-processing step using the simulation\ndata at selected epochs. Ideally, explicitly three-dimensional flow motions should be considered in identifying shocks in simulation data. However, to simplify the analysis we used\na one-dimensional procedure applied successively in all three primary directions. A zone\nwas tagged as a \"shock zone\" currently experiencing shock dissipation whenever these three\ncriteria are met: 1) \u2206T * \u2206s > 0, i.e., the gradients of gas temperature and entropy have\nthe same sign, 2) \u2207 * ~v < 0, i.e., the local flow is converging (where \u2207 * ~v is the divergence\nof three-dimensional velocity field), 3) |\u2206 log T | \u2265 0.11, where in each case we define central\ndifferences according to the scheme, \u2206Q = Qi+1 \u2212 Qi\u22121 . The third condition corresponds\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nto the temperature jump of a Mach 1.3 shock. Typically, a shock is represented by a jump\nspread over 2 \u2212 3 tagged zones. Hence, we identified a \"shock center\" within the numerical\nshock where \u2207 * ~v is minimum and labeled this center as part of a shock surface.\nThe Mach number of shock centers, M, was calculated from the temperature jump\nacross shocks, which is given by\nT2\n(5M 2 \u2212 1)(M 2 + 3)\n=\n,\nT1\n16M 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere T2 and T1 are the postshock and preshock temperatures. Shock centers identified in\nmultiple directional passes were labeled by the maximum M. We followed only those portions\nof shock surfaces with M \u2265 1.5 to avoid confusion from complex flow patterns and shock\nsurface topologies associated with very weak shocks. In the actual simulations, the minimum\ngas temperature was set as the temperature of CMBR, that is, Tmin = 2.7(1 + z), since\nphotoionization and heating as well as radiative cooling were ignored. However, considering\nthat significant reionization would have taken place by z \u223c 15 (see, e.g., Haiman & Holder\n2003), in post-processing we set the minimum gas temperature at Tmin = 104 K. The shock\nproperties described below include that consistency adjustment.\nFigure 1 shows a two-dimensional slice from the 10243 simulation isolating a typical\ngroup with X-ray emission weighted temperature, Tx \u2248 1.3 keV, and X-ray luminosity,\nLx \u2248 4.2 \u00d7 1043 h erg s\u22121 . The figure shows the locations of identified shocks along with the\nX-ray emissivity, gas temperature, density, and velocity field distributions. Although the\nX-ray emissivity distribution looks relatively smooth and round, there are complex accreting\nflows around the group including three sheets (dotted line contours in the temperature\ncontour map) and one filament (thin solid line contours). A complex topology of shock\nsurfaces surrounding the group can be seen in the temperature contour map and through\nthe locations of identified shocks. The group as well as the associated sheets and filament are\nbounded by shocks, but there are several additional shock structures within that represent\na variety of converging flow patterns. To illustrate the limitations of conventional spherical\naccretion concepts, we note that this group provides an example of structures where shocks\ncan form in the core by organized infall flows accreting from filaments and sheets that\npenetrate deep into the center of potential wells. The Mach number of the surface along\nthe portion of the accretion shock centered at (x, y) = (3.5, 4.0)h\u22121 Mpc ranges over 2.4 \u2212 4\nwith a mean value of 3.2, while that along the portion centered at (x, y) = (5.5, 4.0)h\u22121 Mpc\nranges 5.3 \u2212 8.3 with a mean value of 6.5. Although quite strong shocks of Mach number of\na few, including these, were often found within 0.5 \u2212 1h\u22121 Mpc from the center of clusters\nand groups, most shocks identified in our simulations are located outside the cores of clusters\nand groups (see the next section and Figure 5).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nIn order to illustrate how our shock identification scheme works, we plot in Figure 2\nthe flow structure along the horizontal path drawn just below y = 4h\u22121 Mpc in the shock\nlocation plot of Figure 1. As indicated in the upper right panel of the figure, two outer shocks\nwith high Mach numbers and three inner shocks with lower Mach numbers were identified\nalong the path. The existence of these five shocks is also clearly evident in the velocity field\nand temperature contours in Figure 1. Extensive tests showed that our scheme identifies\nshock surfaces reliably with a typical error of a few percent in Mach number.\n\n3.\n\nProperties of Cosmological Shock Waves\n\nIn previous studies by Miniati et al. (2000) and by other authors, cosmological shock\nwaves were often organized into three categories; i.e., accretion shocks, merger shocks, and\ninternal flow shocks. However, based on close examination of shock locations and the properties of the shocks and their associated flows in our simulations, we suggest instead that\nit is very informative to classify cosmological shocks into two broad populations that can\nbe conveniently labeled as external and internal shocks, depending on whether or not the\nassociated preshock gas was previously shocked (that is, whether T1 \u2264 104 or > 104 for the\npreshock temperature in practice). This binary classification facilitates the understanding\nof their role in energy dissipation (see the next section). External shocks surround sheets,\nfilaments and knots, forming when never-shocked, low density, void gas accretes onto those\nnonlinear structures. Subsequent, internal shocks are distributed within the regions bounded\nby external shocks. They are produced by flow motions accompanying hierarchical structure\nformation inside the bounding shocks. For more refined questions internal shocks can be further divided into three types: 1) accretion shocks produced by infall from sheets to filaments\nand knots and from filaments to knots, 2) merger shocks formed during subclump mergers,\nand 3) flow shocks induced by chaotic supersonic motions inside the nonlinear structures.\nFigure 3 represents a two dimensional slice of a (25h\u22121 Mpc)3 volume extracted from\nthe 10243 grid zone simulation. It shows the distributions of external and internal shocks in\na cluster with X-ray emission-weighted temperature, Tx \u2248 3.3 keV, and X-ray luminosity,\nLx \u2248 1.4 \u00d7 1045 h erg s\u22121 , along with the gas density distribution and the velocity field\nof the inner parts of the slice. External shocks here define an entire \"cluster complex\"\nwhich has dimensions of about (10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 20)(h\u22121 Mpc)3 . Numerous internal shocks were\nidentified inside the complex. The two-dimensional velocity field demonstrates that infalls\nfrom several associated filaments and sheets form accretion shocks and also induce chaotic\nflow motions in the medium around the cluster. Figure 4 shows a three-dimensional view\nof shock surfaces around the same cluster complex. Surfaces of external shocks with high\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nMach numbers, represented with yellow, encompass the complex and filaments associated\nwith it. Several sheets with lower Mach numbers, which intersect at the complex, are also\nclearly visible. These figures show clearly that the canonical spherical external accretion\nshock model around a cluster would be far too simple to apply to this sample cluster. Note,\nin particular, that a \"spherical\" cluster of Tx = 3.3 keV has the first caustic at Rc \u2248 3.5h\u22121\nMpc from the center in our \u039bCDM model (Ryu & Kang 1997), around which the external\nshock would be located. That is well inside the external, accretion shock in this simulated\ncluster complex.\nWe will now estimate some quantitative measures of shock frequency. To start we computed the surface area of identified shocks per logarithmic Mach number interval, dS(M, z)/d log M,\nnormalized by the volume of the simulation box. This provides an effective inverse comoving\nmean distance between shock surfaces. In this accounting each shock center contributes a\nsurface 1.19(\u2206l)2 , which is the mean projected area within a three-dimensional zone for random shock normal orientations. The upper two panels of Figure 5 show dS(M, z)/d log M\nfor external and internal shocks at several epochs in the simulation with 10243 grid zones.\nTable 1 lists the integrated mean shock separation, 1/S(z), along with the mean values of\nthe shock Mach number, the shock speed, the preshock sound speed and the preshock gas\ndensity.\nSeveral important points are apparent. 1) The two populations of shocks have distinctive\ndistributions of shock surfaces, dS(M, z)/d log M, implying they are induced by flows of\ndifferent characteristics. The area distribution of external shock surfaces peaks at M \u2248 3\u22125,\nextending up to M \u223c 100 or higher. In contrast, the comoving area of internal shocks\nincreases to the weakest shocks we identified in our analysis (i.e., M = 1.5). 2) While\nthe comoving area of external shock surfaces has not changed much since z . 2, that of\ninternal shocks has increased significantly. The former behavior reflects the fact that the\n\"bounding\" shapes associated with external shocks have evolved towards simpler shapes to\nalmost balance the increasing comoving volumes enclosed. On the other hand both the\nvolume enclosed and the complexity of internal shocks has increased, so that these shocks\nnow include more area. At the present epoch the total area of external shock surfaces is \u223c 2\ntimes of that of identified internal shocks. 3) Although the mean Mach number is higher for\nexternal shocks, the mean shock speed is actually larger for internal shock. In addition, the\npreshock gas density is significantly higher for internal shocks. These factors enhance their\ndynamical importance (see the next section). 4) We found that most clusters and groups\nwith Tx & 0.1 keV have shocks within 0.5h\u22121 Mpc from the centers at present. The area\ndistribution of these \"cluster shocks\", shown in the upper right panel of Figure 5, fits best\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nto\n\n!\nr\ndS(M, z)\nM\n\u221d exp \u2212\nd log M\nMch\n\n(2)\n\nwith Mch \u2248 1 in the range of M . 10. Their mean Mach number is \u223c 4. The cluster\nshocks, however, actually account for only a very small fraction of identified shock surfaces.\nWe emphasize that the statistics for the cluster shocks would have been affected by the\nfinite resolution, \u2206l = 97.7h\u22121 kpc, as well as by the exclusion of physical processes like\nradiative cooling and feedback from galaxies and stars that influence conditions inside cluster\ncores. Still, it is significant that, compared with the distribution of binary merger shocks\nstudied in Gabici & Blasi (2003), shocks with higher Mach numbers are more common in the\nenvironments of clusters and groups in our simulation. This difference is because our cluster\nshock population includes accretion shocks created by infall from filaments and sheets to\nknots and flow shocks generated by chaotic supersonic motions, as well as those induced by\nhierarchical merging. Especially, internal accretion shocks are strong with a typical Mach\nnumber of several (see \u00a72.2).\nThe lower two panels of Figure 5 show dS(M, 0)/d log M for external and internal shocks\nat z = 0 in the simulations with different numerical resolutions of 10243 \u2212 1283 grid zones.\nTable 2 lists the integrated surface area, S(0), along with the mass of the gas that went\nthrough shocks at least once, Msg (0), and the total gas thermal energy inside the computational box, Eth (0), at the present epoch in the simulations with 10243 \u2212 643 grid zones.\nThe shocked gas mass, Msg was estimated by summing the mass of gas with T > 104 K.\nWe expect that finite resolution would affect the statistics of shocks in two different ways:\n1) some shocks, especially weak ones with low Mach numbers, may not have been \"captured\" in the hydrodynamic part of simulations, and 2) they may not have been \"identified\"\nby our post-processing shock identification scheme, especially in the regions with complex\nthree-dimensional flow structures. The former causes quantities like Msg and Eth to be underestimated. On the other hand, the latter reduces the estimated value of S(z) and so the\nestimation of shock dissipation (see the next section). We see that Msg and Eth converge\nrather quickly and their converged values should be within \u223c 10% or so of those from the\nsimulation with 10243. This indicates that the ability of our code to capture shocks is not\nthe major limitation. The convergence of the mean shock separation, 1/S and Sext /Sint , is\nnot as obvious from the table. The difficulties in reaching final convergence in these quantities is evident in Figure 5. Detection of strong shocks with M & 10, especially strong\nexternal shocks, is relatively robust in the simulation data with 2563 or more grid zones.\nHowever, the area spanned by weak shocks continues to increase with resolution, reflecting\nthe increased flow complexity captured inside nonlinear structures. The quantities of 1/S\nand Sext /Sint are, however, also plotted in Figure 8, where it is evident that convergence is\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nunderway between the two highest resolution simulations. It is likely that 1/S \u223c 4h\u22121 Mpc,\nand Sext /Sint \u223c 2. It is, then, interesting to note that since the volume of the nonlinear\nstructures where internal shocks are found is \u223c 1/10 of the entire computed volume, the\nmean distance between internal shock surfaces is \u223c 1h\u22121 Mpc within the nonlinear structures, which is comparable to the scale of the nonlinear structure involved. This conclusion,\nof course, includes the caveats that only shocks with M \u2265 1.5 have been counted and that we\nhave omitted from the simulations physics likely to influence shock formation inside cluster\ncores. Accepting the above limitations, we argue in the next section from estimations of the\ngas thermal energy dissipated at shocks and the mass passed through external shocks that\nthe identification of dynamically important shocks should be complete within an error of\norder 10% in the simulation data with 10243 grid zones.\n\n4.\n\nEnergy Dissipation at Shocks\n\nAs the first step to quantitative estimates of the gas thermal energy and CR energy\nfrom dissipation at cosmological shock waves, we defined the following fluxes of mass and\nenergies at each \"shock center\": 1) the gas mass flux incident on shocks, fms (= \u03c11 vsh ); 2)\n3\nthe incident kinetic energy flux, f\u03c6 (= (1/2)\u03c11 vsh\n); 3) the thermal energy flux generated at\nshocks, fth (defined below); and 4) the CR energy extracted, i.e., \"nonthermal dissipation\",\nat shocks, fCR (defined below). Here subscripts 1 and 2 stand for preshock and postshock\nconditions, respectively.\nWe define thermal energy flux generated at shocks as\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b3 \u0015\n\u03c12\nfth = eth,2 \u2212 eth,1\nu2 .\n\u03c11\n\n(3)\n\nWe point out that the second term inside the brackets subtracts the effect of adiabatic\ncompression occurred at a shock, not simply the thermal energy flux entering the shock;\nnamely, eth,1 u1 . The ratio fth /f\u03c6 \u2261 \u03b4(M) then defines the efficiency of shock thermalization,\nwhich is a function of Mach number only, and can be determined from the Rankine-Hugoniot\njump conditions. The left panel of Figure 6 shows \u03b4(M). As expected, \u03b4(M) increases with\nMach number, asymptotically approaching \u03b4(M) \u2192 0.56 for M & 10.\nWe express the CR energy extraction rate as fCR = \u03b7(M)f\u03c6 , where \u03b7(M) measures\nthe efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration for a given Mach number. To estimate this\nefficiency we have used results of numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of CR\nmodified quasi-parallel plane shocks (e.g., Kang et al. 2002; Kang & Jones 2002). The\nsimulations utilize a plasma-physics-based model for the leakage of thermal ions into the CR\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\npopulation, which depends on a single parameter measuring the enhancement of nonlinear\nscattering waves across the shock transition. That parameter is reasonably well limited by\nthe theory and by plasma simulations (see, e.g., Malkov 1998), and, in the DSA simulation\nwe used, typically limits the fraction of protons injected into the CR population at shocks\nto be of order \u223c 10\u22123. The CR acceleration efficiency characteristics of our DSA model\nare broadly consistent with other widely used theoretical and numerical studies of nonlinear\nCR shocks (e.g., Malkov 1999; Berezhko et al. 1995; Ellison et al. 1996). In order to apply\nproperties of our DSA model to cosmological shock waves, we calculated proton acceleration\nand accompanying CR-modified flow evolution for shocks with vsh = 1500 \u2212 3000 km s\u22121\npropagating into media of T1 = 104 \u2212 108 K, assuming Bohm-type diffusion for the CRs (for\ndetails see Kang et al. 2002). As the shock structures evolved we determined the ratio of\nthe total CR energy extraction during the evolution of a shock to the kinetic energy passed\nthrough the shock according to\n\u0015\nZ\n. \u00141\n3\n\u03a6CR (t) \u2261 ECR (x, t)dx\n\u03c11 v t .\n(4)\n2 sh\nx\nThe values of \u03a6CR (t) quickly reached approximate \"time-asymptotic\" values, after which the\nshock structures evolved approximately \"self-similarly.\" These asymptotic values of \u03a6CR (t)\nwere taken as our estimates for \u03b7(M).\nThe left panel of Figure 6 shows the resulting CR acceleration efficiency, \u03b7(M), along\nwith the gas thermalization efficiency \u03b4(M). Both \u03b4(M) and \u03b7(M) increase with Mach\nnumber. In strong, high Mach number shocks, \u03b7(M) approaches the asymptotic value of\n\u03b7(M) \u2192\u223c 0.53. We see that \u03b4(M) is somewhat larger than \u03b7(M) over all Mach numbers.\nOn the other hand, we note that \u03b4(M) was computed for purely gasdynamical shocks; that\nis, without accounting for energy removal into CRs and enhanced adiabatic compression\nwithin the CR shock precursor. If nonlinear dynamical feedback of CRs were included selfconsistently in estimating \u03b4(M), the resulting \u03b4(M) would be somewhat smaller than that\nshown in Figure 6.\nFrom the above gas mass and kinetic energy fluxes at each shock center, we calculated\nthe associated fluxes through surfaces of shocks with Mach number between log M and\nlog M +d(log M) at different redshifts; i.e., dFms (M, z) and dF\u03c6 (M, z), respectively. We also\ncalculated the similarly defined fluxes of gas thermal and CR energies dissipated at shocks as\ndFth (M, z) = dF\u03c6 (M, z)\u00d7\u03b4(M) and dFCR (M, z) = dF\u03c6 (M, z)\u00d7\u03b7(M), respectively. The right\npanel of Figure 6 illustrates dF\u03c6 (M, z)/d log M per unit comoving volume for external and\ninternal shocks at different redshifts in the simulation with 10243 grid zones. A noticeable\npoint is that the kinetic energy flux, and also the gas mass flux through external shocks were\nlarger in the past. This is because the preshock gas density was larger in the past. However,\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthe kinetic energy flux through internal shocks has been more or less constant since z \u223c 1.5,\nand was smaller before that.\nTo provide measures of the roles of shocks over time we integrated from z = 2 to z = 0\nthe gas mass and kinetic energy that passed through shock surfaces and the gas thermal and\nCR energies dissipated at shock surfaces as\nZ z=0\ndYi (M)\n1\ndFi (M, z)\n=\ndt,\n(5)\nd log M\nNi z=2 d log M\nwhere the subscript i \u2261 ms , \u03c6, th, and CR stands for the four fluxes defined above. The\nquantities were normalized either to the shocked gas mass, Nms \u2261 Msg (z = 0), for mass or\nto the total gas thermal energy inside the computational box, Ni \u2261 Eth (z = 0), for energies\n(see Table 2). We also summed these time-integrated measures to calculate the associated\nglobal shock-processed quantities,\n\u0015\nZ M\u0014\ndYi (M)\nd log M.\n(6)\nYi (> M) =\nd log M\n\u221e\nYms and dYms (M)/d log M not only measure the total mass that passed through shocks in\nthe z = 2 to z = 0 interval, but also, by way of their normalization, measure the mean\nnumber of times that gas has been subjected to shock dissipation. Meanwhile, Y\u03c6 and its\nderivative measure the total kinetic energy that has been subject to shock dissipation. On\nthe other hand, Yth and YCR compare the total thermal and CR energies that have resulted\nfrom shock dissipation.\nFigure 7 shows dYi (M)/d log M and Yi (> M) for external and internal shocks in the\nsimulation with 10243 grid zones. Again, several important points are apparent. 1) The plots\nfor dYms (M)/d log M and Yms (> M) indicate that more mass has passed through internal\nshocks than external shocks. With Yms (\u2265 1.5) \u2248 2.2 for internal shocks, the mass inside the\nnonlinear structures of sheets, filaments and knots has been shocked, on average, twice or so\nby internal shocks from z = 2 to 0. But we note that dYms (M)/d log M for internal shocks\nincreases to M = 1.5, the lowest Mach number we kept, and weak shock identification is\nnot fully converged yet with this numerical resolution. So the above value of 2.2 should be\nregarded as the lower limit. 2) On the other hand, since gas enters the nonlinear structures\nby passing through external shocks, Yms (\u2265 1.5) for external shocks (i.e., the mass passed\nthrough external shocks from z = 2 to 0) should match the increase in the shocked gas mass,\nMsg , from z = 2 to 0. In the simulation with 10243 grid zones, we get Yms (\u2265 1.5) = 0.35 for\nexternal shocks, while 0.42 = (0.73 \u2212 0.42)/0.73 is expected with Msg (z = 2) = 0.42Mgas\nand Msg (z = 0) = 0.73Mgas (where Mgas is the total gas mass in the computational\nbox). Although a fraction of the hot gas may have been heated above 104 K by adiabatic\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ncompression in void regions or by weak shocks with M < 1.5, some of this discrepancy could\nbe due to the under-counting of external shocks. So we estimate an error of \u223c 10% or so in\nthe completeness of the identification of external shocks. 3) The lower two panels of Figure 7\nshow that internal shocks play a more important role than external shocks in the dissipating\nenergy associated with structure formation. Specifically, internal shocks with 2 . M . 4\naccount for \u223c 1/2 of dissipation. While the thermal energy generation peaks for shocks in\nthe range 2 . M . 3, the CR energy extraction peaks in the range 3 . M . 4. Miniati\n(2002) identified shocks with 4 . M . 5 as the most important in gas thermalization.\nOur result indicates a somewhat lower Mach number range, because we found more weaker\nshocks in our simulation data. This difference is probably due to our greater resolution (see,\ne.g., Figure 5), as well as due to improved shock capturing in the present code and a more\nsophisticated shock identification scheme. 4) The amount of thermal energy generated at\nshocks from z = 2 to 0 was computed to be \u223c 1.5 times the current gas thermal energy\nin the simulation with 10243 grid zones. Since no other heating or cooling physics was\nincluded, there are two likely contributors to the difference. First, we attribute some of\nthe difference to adiabatic expansion of nonlinear structures after formation. Expansion of\n\u223c 8.5% along each dimension would be enough to reduce the gas thermal energy by a factor\nof 1.5. In addition, some of the discrepancy could be the result of multiple counting of\ninternal shocks in the regions with complex flow structures. So again, we put an error of\na few 10%, at most, in the completeness of the identification of shocks. 5) With the DSA\nmodel we adopted (Kang et al. 2002; Kang & Jones 2002) the ratio of the CR to gas thermal\nenergies dissipated at cosmological shock waves with the Mach number greater than 1.5 is\nYCR (\u2265 1.5)/Yth (\u2265 1.5) \u2248 1/2. 6) There are many shocks with M . 2, but they are not\nimportant in energetics. Hence, although we ignored the shocks with M < 1.5 in this work,\nthat should not significantly impact quantitative energetics results presented here.\nFigure 8 shows Yi (\u2265 1.5) through all shock surfaces in the simulations with different\nresolution of 10243 \u2212 643 grid zones. Note that Yi 's were normalized with Msg and Esg for a\ngiven resolution (Table 2). Yet, for instance, Y\u03c6 , the integrated kinetic energy flux through\nshock surfaces, decreases in the plot by 60% from 10243 to 5123 and by 95% from 5123 to\n2563 . On the other hand, Esg , the total gas thermal energy inside the computational box,\ndecreases only by 8% from 10243 to 5123 and 13% from 5123 to 2563 . This reinforces the\nstatements in the previous section that the error in quantitative assessments of this paper\ncomes mostly from shock identification in the post-processing analysis rather than shock\ncapturing in the code. This also shows that our estimation of an error of order 10% in the\ndata of the 10243 simulation is consistent with resolution convergence.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nWe identified and studied shock waves with Mach number M \u2265 1.5 in a set of cosmological N-body/hydrodynamic simulations for a \u039bCDM universe in a cubic box of comoving\nsize 100h\u22121 Mpc. To facilitate the analysis of their properties, the cosmological shock waves\nwere classified as external and internal shocks, depending on whether or not the preshock gas\nwas previously shocked. External shocks form around outermost surfaces that encompass\nnonlinear structures, so they are by nature accretion shocks that decelerate the previously\nunshocked intergalactic gas infalling toward sheets, filaments and knots. Internal shocks are\nproduced within those nonlinear structures by accretion flows of previously shocked gas from\nsheets to filaments and knots and from filaments to knots, by merging of subclumps, or by\nchaotic flow motions induced in the course of hierarchical clustering.\nFor all shocks of M \u2265 1.5 identified in the simulation of highest resolution, the mean\ndistance between shock surfaces, the inverse indicator of shock occurrence, is \u223c 4h\u22121 Mpc at\npresent. Further, external shocks are more extensive, with their surface area \u223c 2 times larger\nthan that of identified internal shocks at present. With the volume of nonlinear structures\nwhich is \u223c 1/10 of the total volume, the mean distance between internal shock surfaces\nis \u223c 1h\u22121 Mpc within nonlinear structures at present. Although external shocks typically\nhave higher Mach numbers, internal shocks have higher shock speed and higher preshock gas\ndensity. As a result, internal shocks are responsible for \u223c 95% of gas thermalization and for\n\u223c 90% of CR acceleration at shocks, and they process about 6 times more gas mass through\nshock surfaces than external shocks do from z = 2 to z = 0. Internal shocks with 2 . M . 4\nare especially important in energy dissipation, contributing \u223c 1/2 of the total. By adopting\na model of CR proton acceleration based on nonlinear diffusive shock simulations (Kang et\nal. 2002), our study predicts that the ratio of the CR to gas thermal energies dissipated at\nall cosmological shocks through the history of the universe could be \u223c 1/2. Due to long CR\nproton trapping times and energy loss lifetimes, they should fill the volumes inside filaments\nand sheets as well as in clusters and groups. Short electron lifetimes, however, lead that\npopulation to depend on other factors (Miniati et al. 2001a). The existence of substantial\nCR populations could have affected the evolution and the dynamical status of the large scale\nstructure of the universe (see, e.g., Ensslin et al. 1997).\nThe examination of results from simulations of different resolutions showed that the\nconvergence with resolution in shock identification is slower than in shock capture within\nthe simulation itself. Consistency checks and resolution convergence analysis lead to error\nestimates of order of 10% in our quantitative estimates of the accounting of and energy\ndissipation in cosmological shock waves.\nStrong, external shocks are energetically less important than moderate strength internal\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nshocks. However, it is important to keep in mind that the large curvature radii and long life\ntimes of these shocks make them viable candidates to accelerate CRs to ultra high energies\nof several \u00d71019 eV (Norman et al. 1995; Kang et al. 1996).\nThe Mach number distribution and the amount of energy dissipation at cosmological\nshocks have significant implications for several cosmological observations such as radio and\n\u03b3-ray emissions as well as X-ray emission from the ICM and contribution to the cosmic\n\u03b3-ray background from CRs accelerated at these shocks (see, e.g., Loeb & Waxmann 2000;\nMiniati et al. 2001b,a; Miniati 2002). These important issues, along with the observational\nmanifestation of cosmological shock waves, will be considered in future studies.\nDR and HK were supported by KOSEF through Astrophysical Research Center for\nthe Structure and Evolution of Cosmos (ARCSEC).

Contours of gas density \u03c1gas /h\u03c1gas i \u2265 1 are shown. In\nthe temperature contours, heavy solid lines are used for log T > 6.8, light solid lines are for\n5.5 < log T < 6.8, and dotted lines are for 4 < log T < 5.5. Several sheets and a filament\nwere identified in the temperature contours.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Flow structure along the line path drawn in Figure 1, showing gas density, Mach\nnumber of identified shocks, gas temperature and \u2207 * ~v.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Two-dimensional slice of (25h\u22121 Mpc)2 around a complex including a cluster of\nX-ray emission weighted temperature Tx \u2248 3.3 at z = 0, showing gas density, internal and\nexternal shock distributions, and velocity field.

Dots for \u03b7(M) are the values estimated from\nnumerical simulations based on a DSA model and solid line is the fit. Right panel: Kinetic\nenergy flux per unit comoving volume through surfaces of external and internal shocks with\nMach number between log M and log M + d(log M) at different redshifts, dF\u03c6 (M, z), in the\nsimulation with 10243 grid zones.

Lower Right panel: Same energies, Y\u03c6 (> M),\nYth (> M), YCR (> M), processed through surfaces of external and internal shocks with Mach\nnumber greater than M, from z = 2 to z = 0. The mass and energies are normalized to the\nthe shocked gas mass, Msg , and the total gas thermal energy, Eth , inside simulation box at\nz = 0, respectively.
