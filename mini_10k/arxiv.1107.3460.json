Chandrasekhar's research contributions to astrophysics, ranging\nfrom his early studies on white dwarfs using relativistic quantum statistics to topics as diverse as dynamical friction, negative hydrogen ion, fluid dynamical instabilities, black holes and gravitational\nwaves. The exposition is based on simple physical explanations in the context of observational astronomy, addressed primarily to the undergraduate students. Black holes and their role as central\nengines of active, compact, high energy sources have been discussed in some details.\n\n1\n\n\fI INTRODUCTION\n\nThe impactful research journey of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar began on July 31, 1930,\nfrom Bombay port on a ship. The 19 year old Chandra was on his way to England for higher\nstudies. Armed with his understanding of Fowler\u2032 s work on white dwarfs1 , Chandra was\nimmersed in the mathematical equations describing these dense objects, during that voyage.\nHe had realized that Fowler's theory needed modification, since for sufficiently massive white\ndwarfs, particle number densities could be so high that a large fraction of electrons would\nbe occupying very high energy levels, moving with relativistic velocities.\nAt this juncture, a quick summary of stellar evolution theory is in store. In main sequence\nstars (like Sun), nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium supplies the required thermal energy to\nstall gravitational contraction of a star, enabling it to attain a quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium.\nAs the star advances in age, a further sequence of nuclear fusion reactions gets activated in\nits core - helium burning to carbon and oxygen, carbon burning to sodium and magnesium\nand so on, if the star is massive enough, till the formation of iron-rich core. Iron nucleus\nbeing the most stable one, further nuclear burning is energetically not feasible. As the\niron core cools, the thermal pressure due to the left over heat energy is insufficient to halt\nthe collapse under its own weight. Eventually the electron density becomes so high that\nthe electron degeneracy pressure comes into play, and prevents further contraction. For\nlow mass stars however, white dwarf stage is reached with the formation of a degenerate\ncarbon-oxygen core after the red giant phase resulting from helium burning.\nDegeneracy pressure is a consequence of quantum statistics in extremely dense matter.\nPauli exclusion principle (PEP) states that no two identical fermions can have the same\nstate. Electrons, protons, neutrons, neutrinos, etc., being spin half particles, are fermions.\nAccording to PEP, in a gravitationally bound system like the iron-rich core of an evolved star,\nall the electrons cannot occupy the lowest energy level (unlike, what happens to identical\nbosons in Bose-Einstein condensates, e.g. He-4 superfluid). So, the energy levels are filled\nup with two electrons (one with spin up state and the other with spin down) per orbital, as\ndemanded by the PEP. More the density of electrons, higher is the electronic energy level\nthat gets to be occupied.\nGravitational shrinking of such a dense core leads to an increase in electron density,\nthereby encountering a stronger resistance since the contraction implies putting electrons\n2\n\n\fat higher energy levels. Therefore, in such a 'degenerate matter' dominated system, the\ngravitational collapse instead of lowering the total energy of the star tends to increase it.\nThe ensuing pressure against shrinking, arising out of PEP in such an electron-rich dense\nmatter is called electron degeneracy pressure (EDP). A white dwarf is a star that is in\nhydrostatic equilibrium not because of thermal pressure but due to the EDP that counteracts\ngravitational contraction. Fowler had assumed electrons to be moving non-relativistically\ninside the degenerate core, and had arrived at the result that the EDP of a white dwarf is\nproportional to \u03c15/3 , where \u03c1 is the density of the core1 .\n\nII CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT AND COMPACT OBJECTS\n\nHaving realized that electrons would be randomly whizzing around in the enormously\ndense core with relativistic speeds, Chandra incorporated Einstein's special relativity in the\nanalysis of white dwarfs, and found that the EDP is actually proportional to \u03c14/3 instead,\ndemonstrating that the relativistic degeneracy pressure does not increase as rapidly as in\nFowler's case. Employing a physically realistic analysis of the relativistic problem of a dense\nstar ruled by a polytropic equation of state, in which gravity is countered by the EDP, he\narrived at the celebrated Chandrasekhar mass limit2 ,\nMCh\n\n0.2\nh\u0304c\n=\n2\n(mp \u03bce ) G\n\u0012\n\n\u00133/2\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere h\u0304, G, c, mp and \u03bce are the reduced Planck\u2032 s constant, Newton\u2032 s gravitational constant,\nspeed of light, mass of a proton and mean molecular weight per electron, respectively. It is\nremarkable that such a significant result concerning stars should be expressible in terms of\nfundamental quantities (except for \u03bce ). In white dwarfs, the value of \u03bce is about 2, so that\nfrom eq.(1) one finds the limit to be MCh \u2248 1.4 M\u2299 , where M\u2299 = 2 \u00d7 1030 kg is the Sun\u2032 s\nmass.\nDuring the voyage, Chandra was unaware that Anderson in 1929 and Stoner in 1930 had\nindependently applied special relativity to obtain mass limits for a degenerate, dense star of\nuniform density but without taking into account the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium3,4,7 .\nWhen Chandra showed his work to Fowler after reaching Cambridge, Fowler pointed out\ncontributions of Anderson and Stoner to him. Chandra added these references to his papers\non relativistic degeneracy in white dwarf stars 5 . Incidentally, Landau too had arrived at a\n3\n\n\fmass limit independently in 1931, which appeared in print one year later6 .\nChandrasekhar mass limit entails that no white dwarf with mass greater than this limit\ncan hold out against gravitational collapse. All the white dwarfs discovered so far (e.g. Sirius\nB, the companion star to Sirius), have mass less than MCh . For masses beyond this limit,\ntwo prescient ideas were put forward independently, that played important roles later - one\nof Landau6 , before the discovery of neutrons by Chadwick in 1932 and the other by Baade\nand Zwicky8,9 , immediately after the discovery. Landau had speculated that for stellar cores\nwhose mass exceeded MCh , the density would become so large due to shrinking that the\natomic nuclei in the core would come in contact with each other - the whole core turning\ninto a giant nucleus6 . Baade and Zwicky, while attributing the origin of cosmic rays to\nstellar explosions called supernovae, correctly identified the energy liberated due to sudden\ndecrease in the gravitational potential energy (as the core collapses rapidly to form a neutron\nstar of radius \u223c 10 km) as the one that powers supernova explosion8,9 . A core with mass Mc ,\nshrinking from a large size to a neutron-rich ball with radius Rc , has to give up an energy,\nGMc2\n,\n(2)\nRc\nsince its gravitational potential energy decreases to \u223c \u2212Eexp . For a 1.4 M\u2299 core collapsing\nEexp \u223c\n\nto form a neutron star of radius Rc \u2248 10 km, the energy Eexp available for explosion is as\nhigh as \u223c 1053 ergs.\nWhy does the core become neutron-rich? As the core shrinks, its density rises till it\nreaches nucleonic values \u223c 1012 - 1014 gm/cm3 , when protons in the core transform into\nneutrons by capturing electrons and emitting neutrinos10 . Neutrinos, being weakly interacting particles, escape from the core. While in the neutron-rich core, the neutron degeneracy\npressure (arising from PEP, as neutrons too are spin half particles) prevents further gravitational contraction, resulting in the formation of a neutron star.\nWith the detection of periodic emission of radio-pulses from a source by Jocelyn Bell and\nAnthony Hewish in 1967, existence of neutron stars as pulsars was established. Pulsars are\nrapidly spinning neutron stars with rotation period ranging from about few milli-seconds\nto few seconds. The observed pulses are due to electromagnetic radiation from accelerated\ncharge particles moving along strong magnetic field lines inclined with respect to the rotation\naxis (The polar magnetic field strengths vary from \u223c 1010 to \u223c 1014 gauss). Recently,\na milli-second pulsar was found to have a mass of \u2248 2 M\u2299 , determined using a general\n4\n\n\frelativistic effect called Shapiro delay in which radiation grazing past a compact, massive\nobject, arrives at the observer with a time lag because of the strongly curved space-time\ngeometry it encounters near the massive star11 .\nAs long as the core is lighter than about 2 \u2212 3 M\u2299 , it can survive as a neutron star\n(The mass limit in this case is uncertain as it depends crucially on the equation of state for\nnuclear matter which, for such huge densities existing inside neutron stars, is unknown11,12 ).\nThe released neutrinos, after travelling long distances, eventually lose their energy to the\nstellar envelope, causing the latter to be blown apart, giving rise to a Type II supernova.\nMeasurements concerning detected neutrinos from the supernova SN 1987A indicate that\nthese ultra-light, weakly interacting particles carry away 99% of the gravitational binding\nenergy released from the collapsing core, lending credence to the neutrino driven explosion\nmodels10 .\nThe observed masses for neutron stars do not appear to exceed \u223c 3 M\u2299 11,12 , suggesting\nthat a massive star whose core is heaver than this limit, would certainly collapse to form\na black hole. The long duration gamma ray burst sources that exhibit prompt gamma\nemissions with photons having energy predominantly in 0.1 - 1 MeV range, and lasting for\nabout 2 - 1000 s are likely to be massive cores collapsing to form black holes13 . Eddington\nwas extremely critical of Chandra's work which suggested that a star exceeding the mass\nlimit would shrink gravitationally to a point singularity14 . Three decades later, Penrose and\nHawking, using Raychaudhuri equation, proved the seminal singularity theorems. According\nto these theorems, gravitational collapse of normal matter generically lead to formation of\nsingularities, namely, creation of black holes15\u221217 .\n\nIII DYNAMICAL FRICTION\n\nChandra played a stellar role in the research area of gravitational dynamics of point\nmasses, from 1939 to 1944, that culminated in his celebrated papers on dynamical\nfriction18,19 . There is abundance of gravitationally bound systems of massive objects in\nthe cosmos like globular clusters, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. Entities that make up\nthese bound systems, apart from moving in self-created gravitational potential wells, also\nsuffer two-body gravitational encounters, resulting in exchange of energy and momentum.\nChandra discovered that a massive body in motion, surrounded by a swarm of other less\n5\n\n\fmassive objects, suffers deceleration that is proportional to its mass18 .\nThis dynamical friction originates from cumulative gravitational encounters that the massive body experiences due to the presence of other objects in the background. The physical\ncause of dynamical friction can be intuitively understood by going to the reference frame in\nwhich the more massive body is at rest. In this reference frame, the swarm of background\nobjects moving past the massive body get focussed behind it because of its attractive force,\nforming a wake of higher number density of objects, and hence of higher mass density.\nWhen we switch back to the original frame in which the massive body is moving, we find\nthat the mass density of the wake behind the larger mass is greater than the density ahead.\nConsequently, it experiences a greater gravitational pull from behind, and thereby suffers\na gravitational drag force whose magnitude is proportional to the square of its mass and\ninversely proportional to the square of its speed20,21 .\nObservational support for dynamical friction comes from sinking of globular clusters\ntowards the central regions of galaxies, and galactic cannibalism in which the orbit of a\nsatellite galaxy decays, leading eventually to its merger with the bigger galaxy21,22 .\n\nIV NEGATIVE HYDROGEN ION\n\nDuring the early forties, Chandra was also involved with the quantum theory of negative\nhydrogen ion. Now, can a proton capture two electrons to form a charged bound state? How\nis it relevant to astrophysics? The first issue had been settled by Bethe in 1929 who showed\nthat quantum mechanics indeed predicts formation of H \u2212 ions23 . As to the second question,\nit has been found over the years that H \u2212 is a weakly bound system with a binding energy\nof \u2248 0.75 eV. Since it takes only about 0.75 eV to knock off the extra electron from H \u2212 ,\nits life-time under terrestrial conditions is small but in thin and tenuous plasma where the\ncollision frequency is low, one expects negative hydrogen ions to survive for longer duration.\nEarly on, Wildt had foreseen that H \u2212 would form in large numbers in the upper atmosphere of Sun, because of the abundant presence of hydrogen atoms and electrons there. He\nhad also come to the conclusion that photo-detachment of H \u2212 would contribute greatly to\nsolar opacity, since radiation from Sun would be attenuated as they photo-ionize H \u2212 ions\non their way out24\u221226 .\nChandra and his collaborators played a significant role in calculating H \u2212 photo6\n\n\fabsorption matrix element, so crucial for estimating the quantum probability (and, therefore,\nthe cross-section) of photo-ionization of negative hydrogen ion27\u221233 . The opacity or the optical depth is proportional to the photo-absorption cross-section \u03c3 as well as n, the number\ndensity of H \u2212 . This is because, the number of photo-ionizations per photon per unit time\nis c n \u03c3, so that the mean free path length for photons is simply,\nl=\n\n1\n.\nn\u03c3\n\nThe optical depth essentially is the ratio of the geometrical path length traversed by the\nradiation to mean free path length l (i.e., it is the number of absorptions suffered by the\nphotons on an average).\nThe negative hydrogen ion has only the ground state as a bound state. There is no\nsingly excited state that is a bound state. As a result, photons with energy above 0.75 eV,\nexecuting random walks out of Sun due to multiple scatterings, would be absorbed by H \u2212\nions after detaching their extra electrons to the continuum. This is the major cause for solar\nopacity in the infra-red to visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nIn 1943, Chandrasekhar and Krogdahl drew attention to the fact that the dominant\ncontribution to the matrix element describing the probability amplitude for such a photodissociation comes from the wavefunction at large distances (several times the Bohr radius).\nTherefore, an accurate knowledge of electronic wavefunction of H \u2212 is required to compute\nthe matrix element correctly27 .\nChandra and his collaborators made seminal contributions in calculating the continuous\nabsorption coefficient \u03ba\u03bb as a function of the photon wavelength \u03bb, taking into account\ndipole-length and dipole-velocity formulae, that provided a solid theoretical foundation for\nthe characteristic \u03ba\u03bb - \u03bb plot which exhibits a rise in the range 4000 to 9000 angstroms and\nthen drops to a minimum at 16000 angstroms, with a subsequent rise34 .\nThe negatively charged hydrogen ion also plays an important role in cyclotrons and\nparticle accelerators35 . The advantages in making use of H \u2212 arise out of the possibility of\naccelerating them by applying electric fields and obtaining hot neutral beams in Tokamaks\n(like in ITER)36 . This is because of the relative ease in detaching its extra electron when\nH \u2212 ion is present in the gas cells.\n\n7\n\n\fV MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS\n\nAstrophysical entities are usually permeated with magnetic fields, be it planets like earth,\nJupiter, etc., Sun, sunspots, stars, flares, spiral arms of Milky Way, galaxies, and so on. Magnetic field in a conducting medium like metal or plasma wears out due to Ohmic dissipation.\nHow does terrestrial magnetic field, presumably generated by the electric currents flowing\nin the molten, conducting and rotating core of Earth, counter Ohmic decay?\nDynamo theories involving differential rotation and convection in conducting fluids are\ninvoked to solve this riddle. However, Cowling had proved that magnetohydrodynamical\nflows with axisymmetric geometry will always entail a decaying magnetic field37 . About\ntwo decades later, Backus and Chandra generalized Cowling\u2032 s theorem38 . In this context,\nChandra studied the possibility of lengthening the decay duration so that an axisymmetric\ndynamo provides a feasible explanation for geomagnetism39 . It was immediately followed by\na paper in which Backus showed that the increase was not large enough to be of geophysical\ninterest40 . Chandra studied several fluid dynamical stability problems employing variational\nmethods that have interesting consequences41,42 .\nAn evolved binary system, consisting of a Roche lobe20 filling star, spewing out gaseous\nmatter, and a massive compact object (MCO) like a neutron star or a black hole (BH), both\ngoing around the common centre of mass, very often acts as a luminous source of high energy\nphotons. In such a binary system, gas leaking out from the bloated star cannot radially fall\non the MCO as it has angular momentum. Instead, it spirals inwards, forming an accretion\ndisc around the MCO so that each tiny gaseous volume element of the disc moves along a\ncircular Keplerian orbit43 .\nFor a thin disc with a total mass much less than the mass M of the MCO, the Keplerian\nspeed v(r) of a fluid element at a distance r is given by,\nv(r) =\n\ns\n\nGM\n,\nr\n\n(3)\n\nEq.(3) implies that the fluid elements of the accretion disc rotate differentially. Farther the\nelement from the MCO, lower is its circular speed. Differential rotation leads to viscous\nrubbing of neighbouring fluid elements at varying distances, causing the accretion disc to\nheat up. If the disc is sufficiently hot, it emits copious amount of electromagnetic radiation\nwith a spectrum ranging from visible wavelengths to UV photons and X-rays.\n8\n\n\fThere are strong observational evidences that the rapidly time varying, intense X-ray\nsources, like Cygnus X-1, are accreting black holes (see section VII). Essentially, the gravitational potential energy of the gas spiralling in, gets converted into radiative energy at the\nrate corresponding to a luminosity of,\nL=\u01eb\n\nGM \u1e41\n,\nrmin\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u1e41, rmin and \u01eb are the rate of mass accretion, minimum distance reached by the\ninfalling gas and an efficiency factor for the conversion of gravitational energy to radiation,\nrespectively. The importance of accretion on to compact objects is evident from eq.(4), since\nsource luminosity is larger for smaller values of rmin . Similarly, a luminous source requires\nlarger rates of accretion and higher conversion efficiencies.\nFor the efficiency factor \u01eb to be large, the accretion disc is required to have a high viscosity.\nThe physics of the mechanism responsible for large viscosities in the disc is an active area of\nresearch. Interestingly, as shown by Balbus and Hawley in 1991, the Chandrasekhar instability might be the key to the origin of accretion disc viscosity44 . Chandra had pointed out\nthat a differentially rotating, conducting and magnetized incompressible fluid in a cylindrical\nconfiguration, is unstable with respect to oscillating axisymmetric perturbations41 .\nWhile investigating Rayleigh-Benard convection in conducting and viscous fluids threaded\nwith magnetic field, Chandra studied the onset of convection and its dependence on a dimensionless number Q, representing the square of the ratio of magnetic force to viscous\nforce41 . Today, this number Q is referred to as Chandrasekhar number (or, also as the\nsquare of Hartmann number). Chandra made several other contributions in the field of\nplasma physics and magnetohydrodynamics that had far reaching consequences45 .\n\nVI CHANDRASEKHAR-FRIEDMAN-SCHUTZ INSTABILITY\n\nWhile studying self-gravitating and rotating fluid configurations, Chandra showed that\na uniformly dense and uniformly rotating incompressible spheroid is unstable because of\nnon-radial perturbations, causing emission of gravitational radiation46 . According to Einstein's general relativity, the curvature of space-time geometry manifests as gravitational\nforce. Gravitational radiations are wave-like perturbations in the space-time geometry that\npropagate with speed of light, general relativity being a relativistic theory of gravitation.\n9\n\n\fGravitional waves are radiated whenever the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution\nin a source changes with time. Friedman and Schutz extended Chandra's findings in 1978,\nand demonstrated the existence of gravitational wave driven instability in the general case\nof rotating and self-gravitating stars made of perfect fluid47 .\nAn intuitive way to comprehend this Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability\nis to look at a particular perturbation mode in a rotating star that is retrograde, i.e. moving\nin the backward sense relative to the fluid element going around. According to general\nrelativity, the space-time geometry around a rotating body is such that inertial frames are\ndragged along the direction of rotation (This has been recently verified by the Gravity Probe\nB satellite-borne experiment48 ). The frame dragging, therefore, would make the retrograde\nmode appear prograde to an inertial observer far away from the star. Gravitational waves\nemitted by this mode will carry positive angular momentum (i.e. having the same sense as\nthe angular momentum of the fluid element) as measured in the distant inertial frame. Since,\nthe total angular momentum is conserved, gravitational radiation carrying away positive\nangular momentum from the mode, would make the retrograde mode go around more rapidly\nin the opposite direction, leading to an instability.\nIn 1998, Andersson demonstrated that a class of toroidal perturbations (the so called\nr-modes) in a rotating star are generically unstable because of the gravitational wave driven\nCFS instability49 . It was immediately followed by papers arguing that the r-mode instability\nwould put brakes on the rotation of a newly born and rapidly spinning neutron star50,51 .\nConsequently, as the neutron star spins down, a substantial amount of its rotational energy\nis radiated away as gravitational waves, making it a likely candidate for future detection\nby the laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors, namely, the LIGOs52,53 . The CFS\ninstability may soon be put to experimental tests.\n\nVII BLACK HOLES AND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES\n\nChandra called the astrophysical BHs the most perfect macroscopic objects54 . Macroscopic entities - like chairs, books, computers, etc. around us, need an astronomically large\nnumber of characteristics each for their description. A sugar cube, for instance, would need\nnot only its mass, density, temperature, but also amount and nature of trace compounds\npresent, the manner in which sugar molecules are stacked, porosity, surface granularities,\n10\n\n\fetc, for its proper specification. In contrast, a BH is characterized by just three physical\nquantities - its mass, charge and angular momentum.\nSchwarzschild BHs do not possess charge or angular momentum, while Kerr BHs rotate\nbut have no charge. On the other hand, Reissner-Nordstrom BHs have charge but do not\nrotate. Kerr-Newman BHs are theoretically the most general ones, as they possess non-zero\nmass, charge and angular momentum. Astrophysical black holes are all likely to be Kerr BHs\nsince charge of a BH would get neutralized by the capture of oppositely charged particles\npresent in the cosmic rays and other ambient matter, and since most cosmic objects possess\nangular momentum. Chandra was particularly fascinated by the stationary, axisymmetric\nvacuum solutions of Einstein equations that described the Kerr BHs.\nBHs are characterized by a fictitious spherical surface called the event horizon centred\naround the point singularity created by the collapse of matter. Nothing can escape from\nregions enclosed within the event horizon. For a Schwarzschild BH of mass M, the radius\nof the event horizon is given by the Schwarzschild radius,\n2GM\nM\nRs =\n= 3 \u00d7 106\n2\n6\nc\n10 M\u2299\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nkm .\n\n(5)\n\nBut do BHs exist in the real universe? Classical BHs by themselves do not radiate.\nHawking radiation, which is of quantum mechanical origin, from astrophysical BHs, is too\nminiscule in amount to be of any observational significance55 . So, how does one find BHs in\nnature? In conventional astronomy, their detection relies on the presence of gas or stars in\ntheir vicinity and the ensuing stellar or dissipative gas dynamics around an accreting MCO.\nAs discussed in section V, if the MCO has an accretion disc around it like in galactic X-ray\nsources, quasars, blazars or radio-galaxies, the swirling and inward spiralling gas gets heated\nup, emitting radio, optical, UV and X-ray photons, often accompanied by large scale jets56 .\nIf gas can spiral down to a distance rmin = \u03b1 Rs from the central BH, then according to\neqs. (4) and (5) the radiation luminosity is given by,\nL=\n\n0.5\u01eb 2\n\u1e41c .\n\u03b1\n\n(6)\n\nThe real parameter \u03b1 quantifies the proximity to the central BH. Eq.(6) tells us that accretion\ntaking place close to the event-horizon can convert an appreciable fraction of rest energy mc2\nof the inflowing gas. Higher the accretion rate \u1e41, larger is the luminosity L. (Provided that\nfluid viscosities in the disc are large enough to give rise to higher efficiencies \u01eb, as discussed\nin section V.)\n11\n\n\fThe central engine for a quasar or a blazar is, in all likelihood, an accreting supermassive\nBH with M lying in the range 107 - 109 M\u2299 56 . Invoking eq.(6) with sufficiently large accretion\nrates for blazars, one can theoretically explain high luminosities (at times, exceeding 1048\nerg/s) observed in these sources.\nQuasars and blazars also exhibit fluctuating X-ray luminosities on time scales of only\nfew hours. One can derive an upper limit for the size of the central engine from causality\narguments. If the observed time scale over which the luminosity varies accreciably is \u2206t,\nthe size of the source participating in emission of photons cannot be larger than c\u2206t. This\nis because, firstly, every part of the entire region must be causally connected to each other\nand, secondly, special relativity tells us that parts of the region can physically communicate\nwith each other (to remain in causal touch) only with speeds \u2264 c. X-ray variability on time\nscales of an hour corresponds to a causal size \u2264 109 km. Now, from eq.(5), a BH of mass\n3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 has a Schwarzschild radius of about 109 km. Short time fluctuations and central\nengines involving gas dynamics close to the event horizon of BHs, fit together neatly.\nObservational evidence for accreting super-massive BHs comes not only from short time\nvariability of X-ray fluxes but also from the details of the continuum spectra (e.g. presence\nof the big blue bump in quasar spectra) observed in these active sources. Hence, quasars,\nblazars and powerful radio-galaxies are most probably distant galaxies housing acccreting\nsupermassive BHs with mass in excess of 106 M\u2299 in their central regions56 .\nSimilarly, by monitoring stellar dynamics around the central region of Milky Way for\ndecades, one infers that the Galactic nucleus contains a heavy and compact object, most\nlikely to be a supermassive BH with a mass of about 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 , within a radius of 1013\nkm from the Galactic Centre57 . It is interesting to note that the Chandra X-ray observatory\n(launched on July 23, 1999, and named after S. Chandrasekhar) revealed the presence of a\nX-ray source as well as hot gas with high pressure and strong magnetic field in the vicinity\nof the Galactic Centre.\nHowever, these are indirect detections, implying strictly speaking the presence of a very\ncompact, massive central object. Inference of an astrophysical BH, although very likely,\nrelies on theoretical interpretation. What happens when a BH is perturbed by incident\ngravitational waves or electromagnetic radiation or Dirac waves describing electrons or neutrinos? Does a perturbed BH have a signature emission like a 'ringing\u2032 , analogous to the\ncase of a struck bell? To answer such questions, Chandra devoted himself to studying BH\n12\n\n\fperturbations from 1970s onwards54,60\u221267 .\nWhen a BH is perturbed, the curved space-time geometry around the BH will be subjected\nto metric fluctuations. For sufficiently small perturbations, a linear analysis of the metric\nfluctuations can be carried out in terms of normal modes except that dissipation due to\nboth emission of gravitational waves as well as their absorption by the BH make the mode\nfrequencies complex, with the decay reflected in the imaginary parts. In the case of a\nperturbed BH, such quasi-normal modes (QNMs) correspond to a characteristic ringing of\nthe ambient space-time geometry that eventually decays due to emission of gravitational\nwaves.\nQNMs were discovered by Vishveshwara58 and Press59 while studying gravitational wave\nperturbations of BHs. Chandra and Detweiler suggested for the first time numerical methods\nfor calculating the QNM frequencies62 . Such investigations throw light on methods for\ndirect detection of BHs. For example, matter falling into a Schwarzschild BH would lead\nto excitation of QNMs, resulting in emission of gravitational waves with a characteristic\nfrequency that is inversely proportional to the BH mass.\nOne can understand this dependence from simple dimensional analysis. QNMs would involve perturbations of the event horizon characterized by the Schwarzscild radius Rs (eq.(5)).\nSo, the oscillation wavelengths would be typically of a size proportional to Rs , making the\nfrequencies depend inversely on the BH mass. A supermassive BH with mass 106 M\u2299 would\nring with a frequency of about 10\u22122 Hz. Because of seismic noise, LIGOs cannot detect\ngravitational waves having such low frequencies. Only a space-based gravitational wave\ndetector like LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) can pick up such low frequency\nsignals from supermassive BHs53,70 .\nChandra developed innovative techniques to study BH perturbations, and showed that\nradial and angular variables could be decoupled to obtain separable solutions for Dirac\nequation in Kerr background, corresponding to a massive particle (like an electron)62 . Using\nsimilar techniques, Don Page extended the separation of variables for massive Dirac equation\nto the Kerr-Newman case68 . In 1973, Teukolsky had separated the Dirac equation for two\ncomponent massless neutrinos in the Kerr background69 . It will be interesting to investigate\nif Chandra\u2032 s technique can succeed in separating the Dirac equation for massive neutrinos\n(with flavour mixing and massive right-handed components included) in the Kerr or KerrNewman background.\n13\n\n\fKerr BHs possess ergosphere, a region surrounding the event-horizon where test particles\nwith negative angular momenta (i.e. with reverse sense of rotation relative to BH rotation)\ncan have negative energy (as measured by a distant inertial observer) orbits. Penrose, in\n1969, had shown an ingenious way to extract rotation energy of a Kerr BH that involved\nsending an object that breaks up into two in the ergosphere, with one of the parts going\ninto a negative energy trajectory, while the other escaping with an energy greater than the\ninitial energy (since energy is conserved)71 .\nThe wave analogue of Penrose process is superradiance wherein impinging scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational waves emerge out with greater energy after scattering off Kerr\nBHs. Zel\u2032 dovich was the first to show the existence of superradiance in 197072. Chandra\nand Detweiler undertook a thorough investigation of scattering of electromagnetic, gravitational and neutrino waves in the Kerr background, and showed that neutrinos do not exhibit\nsuperradiance73 . Absence of neutrino superradiance is most likely due to PEP73\u221276 .\nExact solutions of two plane gravitational waves colliding with each other were obtained\nfor the first time by Szekeres77 as well as Khan and Penrose78 . Their work showed that due\nto mutual gravitational focusing, the collision leads to curvature singularity where gravity\nbecomes infinite. Chandra, along with Valeria Ferrari and Xanthopoulos, showed that the\nmathematical theory of colliding gravitational waves can be cast in the form of mathematical\ntheory of BHs, and that the formation of curvature singularity due to gravitational focusing\nis generic79\u221282 .\nIn the later years, Chandra and Valeria Ferrari studied non-radial oscillations of rotating\nstars taking into account general relativistic effects83\u221285 . They showed that the oscillations\ncould be described in terms of pure metric perturbations, reducing the problem to scattering\nof gravitational waves in curved space-time geometry. For strongly gravitating objects like\nneutron stars, such gravitational waves may get trapped inside due to deep gravitational\npotential well, leading to trapped modes that survive for long durations.\nChandra was awarded the Nobel prize for physics in 1983. His method of studying\ndiverse astrophysical topics involved applying physical theories that had been corroborated\nexperimentally, and then subjecting the relevant equations that followed from theory to\nrigorous and innovative mathematical analysis. No wonder that most of the new results he\nobtained were later confirmed by observations.\n\n14\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Fowler, R. H., 1926, Mon. Not. R. Astr.
