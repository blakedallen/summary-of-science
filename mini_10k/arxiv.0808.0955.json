The geometry of unitary orbits \u03a9 \u2282 \u03a3 is studied from the topological and metric viewpoints: we\nseek for conditions that ensure the existence of a smooth local structure for\nthe set \u03a9, and we study the convexity of this set for the geodesic structures\nthat arise when we give \u03a3 two Riemannian metrics. 1\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we study the geometry of unitary orbits \u03a9 in a (Riemannian, infinite dimensional) manifold \u03a3\u221e , a manifold which is modeled\non the full-matrix algebra of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. We investigate necessary and sufficient conditions for these orbits to be analytic\nsubmanifolds. We are also concerned with the explicit form of the\ngeodesics in such submanifolds, and whether this submanifolds are\nconvex when embedded in the full space \u03a3\u221e , or even in the tangent\n(Euclidean) space (where \u03a3\u221e is open). The last results of this paper give a satisfactory characterization of the exponential map of the\nsubmanifold \u03a9 when this set is the unitary orbit of a projection.\nThe main framework of this paper is the von Neumann algebra\nB(H) of bounded operators acting on a complex, separable Hilbert\nspace H.\nThroughout, HS stands for the bilateral ideal of Hilbert-Schmidt\noperators of B(H). This ideal is known as a full-matrix algebra [Rick60]\nsince any Hilbert-Schmidt operator can be identified with an infinite\nmatrix such that any row (and any column) is square-summable. Recall\n[Sim89] that HS is a Banach algebra (without unit) when given the\n1\nnorm kak2 = 2 tr(a\u2217 a) 2 . Inside B(H) we consider a certain kind of\nFredholm operators, namely\nHC = {a + \u03bb : a \u2208 HS, \u03bb \u2208 C},\nthe complex linear subalgebra consisting of Hilbert-Schmidt perturbations of scalar multiples of the identity. Note that this is a complex\n2000 MSC.

For this inner product, we have (by cyclicity of the\ntrace)\nhXY, Y \u2217 X \u2217 i2 = hY X, X \u2217 Y \u2217 i2\n\nfor any X, Y \u2208 HC , and also\n\nhZX, Y Zi2 = hXZ, ZY i2\n\nfor X, Y \u2208 HC and Z \u2208 HR\n\nWe will use HSh to denote the closed subspace of self-adjoint HilbertSchmidt operators. Inside HR , consider the subset\n\u03a3\u221e := {A > 0, A \u2208 HR }\nThis is the set of invertible operators a+\u03bb such that \u03c3(a+\u03bb) \u2282 (0, +\u221e),\nwith a self-adjoint and Hilbert-Schmidt, \u03bb \u2208 R. Note that, since a is\ncompact, then 0 \u2208 \u03c3(a), which forces \u03bb > 0. It is apparent that \u03a3\u221e\nis an open set of HR , therefore a real analytic submanifold. For any\np \u2208 \u03a3\u221e , we may thus identify Tp \u03a3\u221e with HR , and endow this manifold\nwith a (real) Riemannian metric by means of the formula\nhX, Y ip = p\u22121 X, Y p\u22121\n\n2\n\n= Xp\u22121 , p\u22121 Y\n\n2\n\nWith this metric \u03a3\u221e has nonpositive sectional curvature [AV03]; moreover, the curvature tensor is given by the following commutant:\nRp (X, Y )Z = \u2212\n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\u0002 \u22121\np p X, p\u22121 Y , p\u22121 Z\n4\n\n(1)\n\n\u0001\n1\nXp\u22121 Y + Y p\u22121 X\n2\n\n(2)\n\nCovariant derivative is given by the expression\n\u2207X Y = X(Y ) \u2212\n\nwhere X(Y ) denotes derivation of the vector field Y in the direction\nof X (performed in the ambient space HR ).

Throughout, kXk2p := hX, Xip , namely\nkXk2p = kp\u22121/2 Xp\u22121/2 k2 = Xp\u22121 , p\u22121 X\n\n2\n\n= p\u22121 X, Xp\u22121\n\n2\n\n,\n\nwhich is the norm of tangent vectors X \u2208 Tp \u03a3\u221e . We will use expp to\ndenote the exponential map of \u03a3\u221e .\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\nNote that expp (V ) = p 2 e p 2 V p 2 p 2 , but rearranging the exponential series we get the alternate expressions\n\u22121\n\nexpp (V ) = p ep\n\nV\n\n\u22121\n\n= eV p p\n\nA straightforward computation also shows that for p, q \u2208 \u03a3\u221e we have\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u22122\n2\nq p\u2212 2 )p 2\nexp\u22121\np (q) = p ln(p\n\nLemma 1.3. The metric in \u03a3\u221e is invariant for the action of the\ngroup of invertible elements: if g is an invertible operator in HC , then\nIg (p) = gpg \u2217 is an isometry of \u03a3\u221e .\nProof. It follows from Remark 1.1.\nRemark 1.4. \u03a3\u221e is complete as a metric space due to the following fact, which is also strongly connected with the fact that sectional\ncurvature is nonpositive, see [AV03] and [La04]:\nkX \u2212 Y k2 \u2264 dist(eX , eY ) = k ln(e\u2212X/2 eY e\u2212X/2 )k2\nThis inequality was first shown for the operator (spectral) norm in the\npaper [CPR94], and in that context is related with I. Segal's inequality\nkex+y k\u221e \u2264 kex/2 ey ex/2 k\u221e (see [CPR92] for further details).\nThe manifold \u03a3\u221e is also complete in the following sense: expp is\na diffeomorphism onto \u03a3\u221e for any p. The reader should be careful\nwith other notions of completeness, because, as C.J. Atkin shows in\n[Atkin75] and [Atkin87], Hopf-Rinow theorem is not valid in the infinite\ndimensional context.\n\n2\n\nUnitary orbits\n\nThe total manifold can be decomposed as a disjoint union of geodesically convex submanifolds\n\u03a3\u03bb = {a + \u03bb \u2208 \u03a3\u221e , a \u2208 HSh and \u03bb > 0 fixed }\nThere is a distinguished leaf in the foliation, namely \u03a31 , which contains the identity. Moreover, \u03a31 = exp(HSh ). We will focus on this\nsubmanifold since the nontrivial part of the geometry of \u03a3\u221e is contained in the leaves [La04]. We won't have to deal with the scalar part\nof tangent vectors, and some computations will be less involved.\n\n3\n\n\f2.1\n\nThe action of the unitary groups UHC , UB(H)\n\nWe are interested in the orbit of an element 1 + a \u2208 \u03a31 by means of\nthe action of some group of unitaries. We first consider the group of\nunitaries of the complex Banach algebra of 'unitized' Hilbert-Schmidt\noperators. To be precise, let's call\nUHC = {g = 1 + a : a \u2208 HS, g \u2217 = g \u22121 }\nThe Lie algebra of this Lie group consists of the operators of the form\nix where x is a Hilbert-Schmidt, self-adjoint operator\nT1 (UHC ) = iHSh = HSah\nRemark 2.1. The problem of determining whether a set in \u03a31 can be\ngiven the structure of submanifold (or not) can be translated into the\ntangent space by taking logarithms; to be precise, note that\nexp(U aU \u2217 ) = U ea U \u2217\nfor any a \u2208 HSh and any unitary U , and that this map is an analytic\nisomorphism between \u03a31 and its tangent space. We will state the\nproblem in this context.\nWe fix an element a in the tangent space (that is, a \u2208 HSh ) and\nmake the unitary group act via the map\n\u03c0a : UHC \u2192 HSh\n\ng 7\u2192 gag \u2217\n\nDefinition 2.2. Let Sa be the orbit of the element a \u2208 HSh for the\naction of the Hilbert-Schmidt unitary group, that is Sa = \u03c0a (UHC ).\nThis raises the question: when is the orbit of a self-adjoint HilbertSchmidt operator a submanifold of HSh ? The answer to this question\ncan be partially answered in terms of the spectrum of the fixed operator:\nTheorem 2.3. If the algebra C \u2217 (a) generated by a and 1 is finite\ndimensional, then the orbit Sa \u2282 HSh can be given an analytic submanifold structure.\nProof. A local section for the map \u03c0a is a pair (Ua , \u03c6a ) where Ua is an\nopen neighborhood of a in HSh and \u03c6a is an analytic map from Ua to\nUHC such that:\n\u2022 \u03c6a (a) = 1\n\u2022 \u03c6a restricted to Ua \u2229 Sa is a section for \u03c0a , that is\n\u03c0a \u25e6 \u03c6a |Ua \u2229Sa = idUa \u2229Sa\nA section for \u03c0a provides us with sufficient conditions to give the\norbit the structure of immerse submanifold of HSh (see Proposition 2.1\nof [AS89]). The section \u03c6a can be constructed by means of the finite\nrank projections in the matrix algebra where C \u2217 (a) is represented. The\n\n4\n\n\ffinite dimension of the algebra is key to the continuity (and furthermore\nanalyticity) of all the maps involved. To fix some notation, set n =\ndim C \u2217 (a) and \u03c4 an \u2217 -isomorphism\n\u03c4 : C \u2217 (a) \u2192 C \u2295 C \u2295 * * * \u2295 C\nConsider the set of systems of one-dimensional projections (here p2i =\npi = p\u2217i , pi pj = 0 for any i 6= j):\nPn = {(p1 , * * * , pn ) \u2208 HnC :\n\nn\nX\n\npi = 1}\n\ni=1\n\nDenote eijk \u2208 Mni (C) the elementary matrix with 1 in the (j, k)-entry\nand zero elsewhere, but embedded in the direct sum; take pijk (X) the\npolynomial which makes eijk = pijk (\u03c4 (a)), and consider the following\nelement in HSh : Eijk = pijk (a)\n\u0002\n\u00032\nThere is a neighborhood Ua of a in HSh such that 1\u2212 ei11 \u2212 pi11 (x)\nhas strictly positive spectrum, because r(x) = kxk \u2264 kxk2 and HC is a\nBanach algebra (here r(x) denotes spectral radius). A straightforward\ncomputation shows that the map\n\u03c6a (x) =\n\np X\nni\nX\ni=1 j=i\n\nh\n\u00012 i\u2212 12 i\ni\ni\n1 \u2212 E11\n\u2212 pi11 (x)\npij1 (x)E11\nE1j\n\nis a cross section for \u03c0a , and it is analytic from Ua \u2282 HSh \u2192 UHC\nsince the pijk are multilinear and all the operations are taken inside the\nBanach algebra HC .\nRemark 2.4. At first sight, it is not obvious if this strong restriction\n(on the spectrum of a) is necessary for Sa to be a submanifold of HSh .\nThe main difference with the work done so far by Deckard and Fialkow\nin [DF79], Raeburn in [Rae77], and Andruchow et al. in [AS89], [AS91]\nis that the Hilbert-Schmidt operators (with any norm equivalent to\nthe k * k2 -norm) are not a C \u2217 -algebra. A remarkable byproduct of\nVoiculescu's theorem [Voic76] says that, for the unitary orbit of an\noperator a with the action of the full group of unitaries of B(H), it is\nindeed necessary that a has finite spectrum. For the time being, we\ndon't know if this is true for the algebra B = HC .\nLet's examine what happens when we act with the full unitary\ngroup UB(H) by means of the same action. For convenience let's fix\nthe notation\nSa = {U aU \u2217 : U \u2208 UB(H)}\nWe will develop an example that shows that the two orbits (Sa and\nSa ) are, in general, not equal when the spectrum of a is infinite.\n\n5\n\n\fExample 2.5. Take H = l2 (Z), S \u2208 B(H) the bilateral shift (Sek =\nek+1 ). Then S is a unitary operator with S \u2217 ek = ek\u22121 . Pick any a of\nthe form\nX\nX\na=\nrk ek \u2297 ek\nand\n| rk |2 < +\u221e\nk\u2208Z\n\nk\n\nwith all rk are different. (For instance, put rk =\nh\n\n1\n|k|+1 ).\n\nObviously,\n\na \u2208 HS . We affirm that there is no Hilbert-Schmidt unitary such that\nSaS \u2217 = waw\u2217\nProof. To prove this, suppose that there is an w \u2208 UHC such that\nSaS \u2217 = waw\u2217 . From this equation we deduce that S \u2217 w commutes\nwith a, and given the particular a and the fact that S \u2217 w is unitary, we\nhave\nX\nS\u2217w =\n\u03c9k ek \u2297 ek\nwith | \u03c9k |= 1\nk\u2208Z\n\nbecause a is multiplicity free. Multiplying by S we get to\nX\nX\nw=\n\u03c9k (Sek ) \u2297 ek =\n\u03c9k ek+1 \u2297 ek\nk\u2208Z\n\nk\u2208Z\n\nor, in other terms, wek = \u03c9k ek+1 . Since w is a compact perturbation of\na scalar operator, w must have a nonzero eigenvector x, with eigenvalue\n\u03b1 = ei\u03b8 (since w is also unitary); comparing coefficients the equation\n\u03b1x = wx reads\nX\n\u03b1xk = \u03c9k\u22121 xk\u22121 ,\nwhere x =\nxk ek\nk\n\nThis is impossible because x \u2208 l2 (Z), but the previous equation leads\nto\n| xk |=| xj | for any k, j \u2208 Z\n\nAs we see from the previous example, the two orbits do not coincide\nin general. For the action of the full group of unitaries we have the\nfollowing:\nTheorem 2.6. The set Sa \u2282 HSh can be given an analytic submanifold structure if and only if the C \u2217 -algebra generated by a and 1 is\nfinite dimensional.\nProof. The 'only if' part goes in the same lines of the proof of the\nprevious theorem but being careful about the topologies involved, since\nnow we must take an open set Ua \u2282 HSh such that the map \u03c6 : Ua \u2192\nUB(H) is analytic. But this can be done since the polynomials pijk\nare now taken from Ua to (B(H)n , k k\u221e ), and the maps + and * are\nanalytic since kx.yk\u221e \u2264 kxk2 kyk2 .\nThe relevant part of this theorem is the 'if' part. Suppose we\ncan prove that the orbit Sa is closed in B(H). Then Voiculescu's\n\n6\n\n\ftheorem (see [Voic76], Proposition 2.4) would tell us that C \u2217 (a) is\nfinite dimensional. This is a deep result about \u2217\u2212representations, and\nthe argument works in the context of B(H), but not in HC because the\nlatter is not a C \u2217 -algebra.\nTo prove that Sa is closed in B(H), we first prove that it is closed\nin HC . To do this, observe that if Sa is an analytic submanifold of HSh ,\nthen Sa must be locally closed in the k*k2 norm (in the sense that every\npoint p \u2208 Sa has an open neighborhood U in HSh such that Sa \u2229 U is\nclosed in U , see [Lang]). Since the action of the full unitary group is\nisometric, the neighborhood can be chosen uniformly, that is, there is\nan \u01eb > 0 such that for all c \u2208 Sa , the set Nc = {d \u2208 Sa : kc \u2212 dk2 < \u01eb}\nis closed in the open ball B(c, \u03b5) = {x \u2208 HSh : kx \u2212 ck < \u03b5} (with\nthe 2-norm, of course). Now the proof that Sa is closed in HSh is\nstraightforward, therefore we omit it.\nNow suppose an = un au\u2217n \u2192 y in B(H). We claim that kan \u2212\nyk2 \u2192 0, which follows from a dominated convergence theorem for\ntrace class operators (see [Sim89], Theorem 2.17). The theorem states\nthat whenever kan \u2212 yk\u221e \u2192 0 and \u03bck (an ) \u2264 \u03bck (a) for some a \u2208 HS,\nand all k (here \u03bck (x) denotes the non zero eigenvalues of | x |), then\nkan \u2212 yk2 \u2192 0.\nObserve that | an |= un | a | u\u2217n so we have in fact equality of\neigenvalues. This proves that Sa is closed in B(H) since it is closed in\nHSh .\nWe proved that, when the spectrum of a is finite, Sa and Sa are\nsubmanifolds of \u03a31 . But more can be said: Sa and Sa are the same\nsubset of HSh (compare with Example 2.5):\nLemma 2.7. If a \u2208 HSh has finite spectrum, the orbit under both\nunitary groups coincide.\nProof. The main idea behind the proof is the fact that, when \u03c3(a)\nis finite, a and gag \u2217 act on a finite dimensional subspace of H (for\nany g \u2208 UB(H)). To be more precise, let's call S = R(a), V = R(b),\nwhere b = gag \u2217 . Note that V = g(S) so S and V are isomorphic,\nfinite dimensional subspaces of H. Naming T = S + V this is another\nfinite dimensional subspace of H, and clearly a and b act on T , since\nthey are both self-adjoint operators. For the same reason, there exist\nunitary operators P, Q \u2208 B(T ) and diagonal operators Da , Db \u2208 B(T )\nsuch that\na = P Da P \u2217 , b = QDb Q\u2217\nBut \u03c3(b) = \u03c3(gag \u2217 ) = \u03c3(a), so Da = Db := D. This proves that\nb = QP \u2217 aP Q\u2217 (the equality should be interpreted in T ). Now take\nPT the orthogonal projector in B(H) with rank T , and set u = 1 +\nPT (QP \u2217 \u2212 1T )PT . Then clearly u \u2208 UHC and uau\u2217 = b.\n\n7\n\n\f2.2\n\nRiemannian structures for the orbit \u03a9\n\nSuppose that there is, in fact, a submanifold structure for Sa (resp.\nSa ). Then the tangent map ( = d1 \u03c0a ) has image\n{va \u2212 av : v \u2208 Bah },\nwhere B stands for the Banach algebra B(H) (resp. HC ). So, in this\ncase\nTa Sa ( or Ta Sa ) = {va \u2212 av : v \u2208 Bah }\nWe can go back to the manifold \u03a31 via the usual exponential of operators; we will use the notation\n\u03a9 = eS a\n\n\u03a9 = eSa\n\nor\n\nwithout further distinction. Note that \u03a9 = {uea u\u2217 : u \u2208 UB} \u2282 \u03a31\nand we can identify\nTea \u03a9 = {vea \u2212 ea v : v \u2208 Bah } = { i(hea \u2212 ea h) : h \u2208 Bh }\nRemark 2.8. For any p \u2208 \u03a9, we have\nTp \u03a9 = {vp \u2212 pv : v \u2208 Bah }\n\nand\n\nTp \u03a9\u22a5 = {X \u2208 HSh : [X, p] = 0}\n\nThese two identifications follow from the definition of the action, and\nthe equality\n\u0002\n\u0003\nhx, vp \u2212 pvip = 4 tr (p\u22121 x \u2212 xp\u22121 )v\nRemark 2.9. The submanifold \u03a9 is connected: the curves indexed by\nw \u2208 Bah ,\n\u03b3w (t) = etw ea e\u2212tw\n\njoin ea to uea u\u2217 , assuming that u = ew .\nWe can ask whether the curves \u03b3w will be the familiar geodesics of\nthe ambient space (equation (4) of the introduction). Of course they\nare trivial geodesics if a and w commute. We will prove that this is\nthe only case, for any a:\nProposition 2.10. For any a \u2208 HSh , the curve \u03b3w is a geodesic of\n\u03a31 if and only if w commutes with a. In this case the curve reduces to\nthe point ea .\nProof. The (ambient) covariant derivative for \u03b3w (equations (2) and\n(3) of the introduction) simplifies up to wea we\u2212a = ea we\u2212a w or, writing w = ih (h is self-adjoint)\nhea he\u2212a = ea he\u2212a h\nConsider the Hilbert space (H, h , ia ) with inner product\nhx, yia =< e\u2212a/2 x, e\u2212a/2 y >\n\n8\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere h , i is the inner product of H. The norm of an operator X is\ngiven by\nkXka = sup kXzka =\n\nsup\n\nkzka =1\n\nke\u2212a/2 zk=1\n\nke\u2212a/2 Xzk\u221e = ke\u2212a/2 Xea/2 k\u221e\n\nbecause e\u2212a/2 is an isomorphism of H. This equation also shows that\nthe Banach algebras (B(H), k * k\u221e ) and A = (B(H), k * ka ) are topologically isomorphic and, as a byproduct, \u03c3A (h) \u2282 R. From the very\ndefinition it also follows easily that A is indeed a C\u2217 -algebra.\nA similar computation shows that X \u2217A = ea X \u2217 e\u2212a . Note that ea\nis A-self-adjoint, moreover, it is A-positive. We can restate equation\n(5) as\nhh\u2217A = h\u2217A h,\nThis equation says that h is A-normal, so a generalization of Weyl-von\nNeumann's theorem says that it can be approximated by diagonalizable\noperators with the same spectrum [WvN]; since h has real spectrum,\nh turns out to be A-self-adjoint. That h is A-self-adjoint reads, by\ndefinition, ea he\u2212a = h\u2217A = h; this proves that a and h (and also a and\nw) commute.\n\n2.2.1\n\n\u03a9 as a Riemannian submanifold of HSh\n\nWe've shown earlier that the orbit of an element a \u2208 HSh has a structure of analytic submanifold of HSh (which is a flat Riemannian manifold) if and only if \u03a9 = ea has a structure of analytic submanifold of\n\u03a31 .\nSince the inclusion \u03a9 \u2282 HSh is an analytic embedding, we can ask\nwhether the curves\n\u03b3w (t) = etw ea e\u2212tw\nwill be geodesics of \u03a9 as a Riemannian submanifold of HSh (with the\ninduced metric).\nWe notice that the geodesic equation reads \u03b3\u0308w (t) \u22a5 T\u03b3w (t) \u03a9, and\nwe use the elementary identities \u03b3\u0307 = w\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3w, \u03b3\u0308 = w2 \u03b3 \u2212 2w\u03b3w + \u03b3w2 ;\nwe get to the following necessary and sufficient condition using the\ncharacterization of the normal space at \u03b3(t) of the previous section:\nw2 \u03b3 2 \u2212 2w\u03b3w\u03b3 + 2\u03b3w\u03b3w \u2212 \u03b3 2 w2 = 0\nBut observing that e\u2212wt \u03b3\nthe operator condition\n\n+1\n\newt = e\n\n+a\n\n, this equation translates into\n\nw2 e2a \u2212 2wea wea + 2ea wea w \u2212 e2a w2 = 0\n\n(6)\n\nLet's fix some notation: set ea = 1 + A with A \u2208 HSh ; then the\ntangent space at ea can be thought of as the subspace\nTea \u03a9 = { i(Ah \u2212 hA) : h \u2208 Bh } \u2282 HSh\n\n9\n\n\fand its orthogonal complement in HSh is (see Remark 2.8)\nTea \u03a9\u22a5 = { X \u2208 Bh : [X, A] = 0}\nIt should be noted that both subspaces are closed by hypothesis. Then\nequation (6) can be restated as\nh2 A2 \u2212 2hAhA + 2AhAh \u2212 A2 h2 = 0\n\n(7)\n\nwhere h is the hermitian generating the curve\n\u03b3(t) = 1 + eith Ae\u2212ith = eith ea e\u2212ith\nLet's consider the case when A2 = A:\nRemark 2.11. If A2 = A, A must be a finite rank orthogonal projector\n(since A = ea \u2212 1 and a is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator). Hence \u03c3(a)\nconsists of two points, and in this case (Remark 2.7) the orbit with\nthe full unitary group and the orbit with the Hilbert-Schmidt unitary\ngroup are the same set.\nObserve that when A is a projector, we have a matrix decomposition of the tangent space of \u03a31 , namely HSh = A0 \u2295 A1 , where\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\u0012\n0 x12\nx11\n0\nand A1 =\nA0 =\nx21\n0\n0 x22\nIn this decomposition, x11 = AhA , x22 = (1 \u2212 A)h(1 \u2212 A) are\nself-adjoint operators (since h is) and also x\u221712 = x21 = (1 \u2212 A)hA for\nthe same reason.\nTheorem 2.12. Whenever A = ea \u2212 1 is a projector, any curve of\nthe form \u03b3(t) = eith ea e\u2212ith with h self-adjoint and co diagonal is a\ngeodesic of \u03a9 \u2282 HSh\nProof. Note that A0 = Tea \u03a9\u22a5 , and A1 = Tea \u03a9; note also that equation\n(7) translates in this context to x11 x12 = x12 x22 , a condition which is\nobviously fulfilled by h \u2208 A1 .\nRemark 2.13. Equation (7) translates exactly in 'h0 commutes with\nh1 ' whenever h = h0 + h1 \u2208 HSh , and we have\n[A0 , A1 ] \u2282 A1\n\n[A0 , A0 ] \u2282 A0\n\n[A1 , A1 ] \u2282 A0\n\nSince the orbit under both unitary groups coincide (Remark 2.11),\nassume that we are acting with G = UB; since the tangent space at the\nidentity of this group can be identified with Bah , the above commutator\nrelationships say that iA0 \u2295 iA1 is a Cartan decomposition of the Lie\nalgebra g = Bah .

If ea \u2212 1 is an orthogonal projector, there is no point\np \u2208 \u03a9 such that \u03a9 is geodesic at p.\nRemark 2.15. In the paper [CPR93] by Corach, Porta and Recht, the\nauthors study the differential geometry of self-adjoint projections in a\nC \u2217 -algebra. The authors show the role of the graded decomposition\nof the algebra in the characterization of the geodesics for the Finsler\nstructure that this space carries; the geodesics we obtained are similar\nto the ones obtained in that paper.\n\n2.2.2\n\n\u03a9 as a Riemannian submanifold of \u03a31\n\nIn this section we give \u03a9 the induced Riemannian metric as a submanifold of \u03a31 , and discuss shortly the induced exponential map.\nRecall that covariant derivative in the ambient space is given by\n\u2207\u03b3\u0307 \u03b3\u0307 = \u03b3\u0308 \u2212 \u03b3\u0307\u03b3 \u22121 \u03b3\u0307 and the orthogonal space to p \u2208 \u03a9 are the operators\ncommuting with p, so \u2207\u03b3\u0307 \u03b3\u0307 \u22a5 T\u03b3 \u03a9 if and only if\n\u03b3\u0308\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3\u0308 + \u03b3 \u03b3\u0307\u03b3 \u22121 \u03b3\u0307 \u2212 \u03b3\u0307\u03b3 \u22121 \u03b3\u0307\u03b3 = 0\n\n(8)\n\nThis is an odd equation; we know that any curve in \u03a9 starting at\np = ea must be of the form \u03b3(t) = g(t)ea g(t)\u2217 for some curve of unitary\noperators g.\nFor the particular curves \u03b3(t) = eith ea e\u2212ith , h(t) = ith, so \u1e23(t) =\nih, and \u1e27(t) \u2261 0; equation (8) reduces to the operator equation\nhea he\u2212a + he\u2212a hea = e\u2212a hea h + ea he\u2212a h\n\n(9)\n\nor X \u2217 = X, where X = hea he\u2212a + he\u2212a hea .\nRecall that the unitary groups UB(H) and UHC induce the same\nmanifold \u03a9 \u2282 \u03a31 when the spectrum of a is finite.
