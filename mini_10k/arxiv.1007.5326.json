To make headway, key\nproperties of GMCs displaying various intensities of star formation must be explored observationally in detail. After massive stars are formed, their energy feedback through ionizing\nfluxes, fast stellar winds, and supernova explosions can alter the physical conditions of a\nGMC, subsequently enhancing or inhibiting further star formation. If a knowledge of stellar\ncontent and energy feedback is obtained, it is then possible to assess the relative importance\nof self-propagating, triggered, and spontaneous star formation, and even further estimate the\nstar formation efficiency of a GMC. It is thus crucial to inventory massive stars and young\nstellar objects (YSOs) associated with GMCs. The YSOs are particularly important as they\nprovide the most direct probes for causal relationship between the initial condition (gas) and\nthe end product (stars).\nSuch study is straightforward in concept, but difficult in practice because in distant\ngalaxies the stellar content is not resolved, and in the Milky Way the distances and associations among stars and their interstellar environments are uncertain. The Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) are the only nearby star-forming galaxies in which stars\nare at common, known distances and can be resolved individually. Recent high-sensitivity\nmid-IR Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) observations make it possible to study a large sample\nof YSOs in the MCs (e.g., Whitney et al. 2008; Gruendl & Chu 2009; Simon et al. 2007).\nThe nearly face-on orientation and thin disk structure of the LMC make it easy to identify\nphysical associations between YSOs and their interstellar environments. All objects in the\nLMC can be considered to be at a uniform distance, with <10% error, of 50 kpc (Feast\n1999). In our recent study of massive YSOs in the LMC H II complex N 44 (Chen et al.\n2009, hereafter Paper I), we examined three GMCs with different star formation properties:\nthe central and southern GMCs are associated with bright H II regions and have O-type\nYSOs, while the northern GMC contains only a few faint, small H II regions and has no\nO-type YSOs. The close association of massive YSOs with H II regions in GMCs suggests\nthat massive stars preferentially form in regions where massive stars have been formed previously, within the last few Myr. It is not clear whether this result is a special case for N 44\nor can be generalized.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nWe have thus selected more LMC H II complexes with different morphologies of ionized\ngas and molecular clouds to examine their YSO content and distribution. This study reports\nmassive star formation in the H II complex LH\u03b1 120-N 159 (hereafter N159; Henize 1956).\nN 159 is located between two regions with contrasting activities: to its north are a string of\nactive star formation regions such as 30 Doradus, N 158, and N 160, and to its south lies a\nlarge molecular ridge with little star formation activity (e.g., Indebetouw et al. 2008). The\nionized gas of N 159 shows two prominent lobes in the central region, surrounded by smaller\nH II regions (Figure 1a). The two prominent H II lobes exhibit filamentary arcs resultant\nfrom interactions with stellar winds and a supernova remnant (SNR) in the northern lobe\n(Chu et al. 1997; Williams et al. 2000). The northern and southern lobes appear to be\nseparated by dark clouds, but their independent systems of circular filaments do not suggest\na common origin for their photoionization and dynamic shaping. The stellar content of N 159\nhas been identified loosely as an OB association, i.e., LH105 (Lucke & Hodge 1970). Based\non integrated colors and association with discrete H II regions in N 159, Bica et al. (1996)\nidentified three young clusters of ages < 10 Myr in the A, F, and D components, and an OB\nassociation in the C component (see Figure 1a for the identification of H II components).\nSurveys of CO toward N 159 (Figure 1b) show three molecular concentrations whose\npeaks correspond to three GMCs, N 159-E, N 159-W, and N 159-S, respectively (Johansson et al.\n1998). The similarity in their radial velocities, Vlsr = 234.1\u2212238.5 km s\u22121 , suggests that they\nare likely physically related. N 159-E is associated with the central prominent H II regions\nof N 159, the bulk of the OB association LH105 (Lucke & Hodge 1970), which include the\nyoung cluster in the D component. N 159-W, an immediate neighbor of N 159-E, hosts a\nfew small, bright H II regions and the western part of LH105, which includes the two young\nclusters in the A and F components. In sharp contrast, the GMC N 159-S shows a much\nlower level of star formation with only a couple of very faint diffuse H II regions and no OB\nassociations, although it is similar in size and even larger in mass compared with each of its\nnorthern neighbors at \u223c 3\u2032 away. A recent study by Nakajima et al. (2005) identified candidate Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars in GMC N 159-S and suggested that cluster formation\nhad just begun in this GMC. However, it is not clear whether the scarcity in massive stars\nseen in the optical and near-IR wavelengths in this GMC is caused by massive stars being\nstill at infancy and deeply embedded in circumstellar material, or not being formed actively\nat all.\nTo study the current massive star formation in N 159, we have used archival Spitzer midIR observations and obtained complementary ground-based optical and near-IR observations.\nThese observations have been analyzed and the results are reported in this paper. Section 2\ndescribes the observations and data reduction. Section 3 reports the identification and\nclassification of YSO candidates. In Section 4 we determine the physical properties of the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nYSOs by modeling their spectral shapes. In Section 5 we discuss the massive star formation\nproperties. A summary is given in Section 6.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nWe have used Spitzer mid-IR observations to diagnose YSOs. To extend the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) and to improve the angular resolution, we have further obtained\nground-based optical and near-IR imaging observations of N 159. We have also retrieved\navailable images in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive to examine the optical counterparts and environments of the YSOs.\n\n2.1.\n\nSpitzer IRAC and MIPS Observations\n\nArchival Spitzer observations from the Legacy Program Surveying the Agents of a\nGalaxy's Evolution (SAGE; Meixner et al. 2006) and GTO Program 124 (PI: Gehrz) were\nused to study YSOs in N 159. These observations include images taken with the Infrared\nArray Camera (IRAC; Fazio et al. 2004) at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 \u03bcm and the Multiband\nImaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS; Rieke et al. 2004) at 24, 70, and 160 \u03bcm. The observation summary is listed in Table 1, in which the program ID, principal investigator, and\ntypical observation parameters are given.\nWe have adopted the Spitzer photometry of point sources from Gruendl & Chu (2009).\nThe photometric data are used to construct SEDs, and the images are used to examine\nthe structure of cold and partially ionized interstellar matter. To cover regions associated\nwith the three GMCs around N 159, the field we have analyzed is 12\u2032 \u00d712.\u2032 5 and is shown in\nFigure 2 in the 3.6, 8.0, and 24 \u03bcm bands. The 3.6 \u03bcm image is dominated by stellar emission,\nthe 8.0 \u03bcm image shows the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, and the 24\n\u03bcm image is dominated by dust continuum emission (Li & Draine 2001, 2002; Draine & Li\n2007). To better illustrate the relative distribution of emission in different bands, we have\nproduced a color composite with 3.6, 8.0, and 24 \u03bcm images mapped in blue, green, and\nred, respectively. In this color composite (Figure 2d), dust emission appears red and diffuse,\nstars appear as blue point sources, red supergiants appear yellow, and dust-shrouded YSOs\nand evolved stars appear red.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.2.\n\nCTIO 4 m ISPI Observations\n\nWe obtained near-IR images in the J and Ks bands with the Infrared Side Port Imager\n(ISPI; van der Bliek et al. 2004) on the Blanco 4 m telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American\nObservatory (CTIO) on 2006 November 9. The images were obtained with the 2K \u00d7 2K\nHgCdTe HAWAII-2 array, which had a pixel scale of 0.\u2032\u2032 3 pixel\u22121 and a field-of-view of 10.\u2032 25\u00d7\n10.\u2032 25. N 159 was observed in one field with ten 30 s exposures in the J band and twenty 30\ns exposures in the Ks band (each of the latter was coadded from two 15 s frames to avoid\nbackground saturation). The observations were dithered to aid in the removal of transients\nand chip defects. The sky observations were made before and after each set of ten on-source\nexposures. All images were processed using the IRAF package cirred for dark and sky\nsubtraction and flat-fielding. The astrometry of individual processed images was solved with\nthe routine imwcs in the package wcstools. The astrometrically calibrated images are then\ncoadded to produce a total exposure map for each filter. The flux calibration was carried\nout using 2MASS photometry of isolated sources.\nAs some of the YSOs appear extended in the ISPI images, we have used additional J and\nKs images taken with the Nasmyth Adaptive Optics System and Near-Infrared Imager and\nSpectrograph (NACO) on the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the European Southern\nObservatory (ESO) (Testor et al. 2006, 2007). These images have a pixel size of 0.\u2032\u2032 027-0.\u2032\u2032054\npixel\u22121 and a superb resolution of 0.\u2032\u2032 11-0.\u2032\u203225, and are thus used to resolve compact groups\nof YSOs.\n\n2.3.\n\nArchival HST Images\n\nWe have searched the HST archive for Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) and\nAdvanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) images in the field of N 159. These observations are\nlisted in Table 2, in which the coordinate, program ID, PI, detector, filter, and total exposure\ntime are given. Each observation contains multiple exposures for the same pointing and filter,\nand these images have been pipeline-processed to remove cosmic rays and to produce a total\nexposure map, which is available in the Hubble Legacy Archive1 .\nFour fields have observations, but not all are useful; for example, the wide U band\n1\n\nBased on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, and obtained from the Hubble\nLegacy Archive, which is a collaboration between the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI/NASA), the\nSpace Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF/ESA) and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre\n(CADC/NRC/CSA).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n(F300W) images have very low S/N. The most useful images are those taken with the H\u03b1\nfilter (WFPC2/F656N or ACS/F658N) or broad-band filters at longer wavelengths such as\nStr\u00f6mgren y (F547M) or WFPC2 V I (F555W and F814W). The former show ionized gas\nand the latter show stars at high resolution.\n\n2.4.\n\nOther Available Datasets\n\nTo construct SEDs for sources in the Spitzer catalog from Gruendl & Chu (2009), we\nhave expanded the catalog by adding optical UBV I photometry from the Magellanic Cloud\nPhotometric Survey (MCPS; Zaritsky et al. 2004) and near-IR JHKs photometry from the\nPoint Source Catalog of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006). As\nthe 2MASS catalog is relatively shallow with a photometric limit of Ks \u223c 14.5, we have also\nused the point source catalog from the InfraRed Survey Facility (IRSF; Kato et al. 2007),\nwhich is \u223c 2 mag deeper than the 2MASS catalog, to match the IRAC sources that do\nnot have 2MASS counterparts. When merging the datasets, we allow a 1\u2032\u2032 error margin for\nmatching Spitzer sources with optical or near-IR sources. Thus, for each Spitzer source, the\nmagnitudes from U to 70 \u03bcm can be converted to flux densities using the corresponding\nzero-magnitude flux listed in Table 3 and then used to construct the SED.\nWe have used H\u03b1 images of N 159 from the Magellanic Cloud Emission-Line Survey\n(MCELS; Smith & The MCELS Team 1999) to examine the large-scale distribution of dense\nionized gas and to compare with images at other wavelengths. As the angular resolution of\nthis survey is \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 , we have used additional H\u03b1 images taken with the MOSAIC camera on the CTIO Blanco 4 m telescope that cover the northern part of our working field\n(Seward et al. 2010). These images, with a pixel size of 0.\u2032\u2032 27 pixel\u22121 , are used to show the\nimmediate environments of YSOs. Finally, as stars are formed from molecular gas, we have\nalso used the CO observations from the Magellanic Mopra Assessment (MAGMA; Ott et al.\n2008; Hughes et al. 2010) to examine the distribution of molecular clouds in N 159.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nIdentification of Massive YSOs\n\nSelection of Massive YSO Candidates\n\nYSOs are enshrouded in dust that absorbs stellar UV and optical radiation and reradiates in the IR. Thus, YSOs can be distinguished from normal stars, i.e., main-sequence,\ngiant, and supergiant stars, from their excess IR emission; they are positioned in redder\nparts of the color-color and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) than normal stars. However,\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nbackground galaxies and evolved stars such as asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can\nalso be red sources, and these contaminants exist in non-negligible numbers. In Paper I\nand Gruendl & Chu (2009), we have demonstrated that using two color-magnitude criteria\n([4.5]\u2212[8.0]) \u2265 2.0 and [8.0] < 14\u2212([4.5]\u2212[8.0]), galaxies and evolved stars can be effectively\nexcluded for the initial selection of massive YSOs. We have thus applied the same criteria to\nselect YSO candidates in N 159. Note that although the full LMC catalogs of YSO candidates\nhave been constructed using similar methods (Whitney et al. 2008; Gruendl & Chu 2009), as\nwill be discussed in \u00a73.4, a detailed analysis on small regions together with new information\nsuch as deep near-IR photometry as we perform here will be more complete and also useful\nin diagnosing sources that might have been previously mis-identified.\nFigure 3a displays the [8.0] versus ([4.5]\u2212[8.0]) CMD of all sources detected in N 159.\nTo illustrate the locations of AGB stars in the CMD, models for Galactic C- and O-rich AGB\nstars (Groenewegen 2006) are also plotted. Although the LMC metallicity is only 1/3 solar,\nas confirmed in Blum et al. (2006), these Galactic models should be good approximations for\nLMC objects since the chemistry of AGB atmospheres is dominated by nucleosynthesized\nmaterial. To avoid crowding, we plot only models for a stellar luminosity of 3000 L\u2299 to\nillustrate the range of colors. For a luminosity range 1 \u00d7 103 \u2212 6 \u00d7 104 L\u2299 (Pottasch 1993),\nthe expected loci of AGB stars in the CMD can move vertically from 1.2 to \u22123.3 mag.\nWe have also searched the known evolved stars in N 159 in the SIMBAD database and\nfound 4 confirmed AGB stars at various evolutionary stages: 2 carbon stars and 2 OH/IR\nstars. These 4 objects are marked with open squares in the [8.0] versus ([4.5]\u2212[8.0]) CMD\n(Figure 3a). Their locations overlap with AGB stellar models and our selection criteria\nindeed exclude them.\nWe obtain a list of 52 YSO candidates from the above selection criteria, however, they\nstill include a significant number of small dust knots, obscured evolved stars, and bright\nbackground galaxies. These contaminants need to be examined closely to assess their nature\nand to be excluded from the YSO list. Following the procedures outlined in Paper I, to better\nresolve these IR sources and their environments, we examine the HST, CTIO 4m ISPI JKs ,\nand CTIO 4m MOSAIC H\u03b1 images. We further use the multi-wavelength catalog described\nin \u00a72.4 to construct SEDs from the U-band to 70 \u03bcm. Using these images and SED data,\nwe have assessed whether the candidates are truly YSOs.\n\n3.2.\n\nIdentification of Contaminants\n\nBackground galaxies can be identified from their morphologies if they are resolved. Two\nof our CMD-selected YSO candidates, sources 054037.09\u2212694521.5 and 054044.66\u2212694550.9\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nshow elongated, extended emission around the point sources in high-resolution MOSAIC\nand ISPI images. The SEDs of these two sources are similar to those of late-type galaxies,\ni.e., characterized by two broad humps, one from stellar emission over optical and near-IR\nwavelength range and the other from dust emission over mid- to far-IR range. In addition,\nthe interstellar environment around these two sources are relatively dust free as they have\nlittle diffuse 8 \u03bcm emission in the surroundings. Based on these considerations, these two\nCMD-selected YSO candidates are reclassified as background galaxies.\nWarm interstellar dust may show mid-IR SEDs indicative of PAH emission (e.g., Gorjian et al.\n2004), similar to those of circumstellar dust in YSOs. As the angular resolution of IRAC images is \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 , corresponding to 0.5 pc for a LMC distance of 50 kpc, some small dust clumps\nmay be identified as point sources and included in the YSO candidate list. In addition, a\nmain-sequence star projected near a dust clump or superposed on dust filaments may also\nmake its way into our YSO candidate list. To identify these two types of YSO imposters,\nwe use our high angular resolution (0.\u2032\u2032 3 pixel\u22121 ) ISPI JKs images. In the ISPI images,\nstars or YSOs appear unresolved and can be further differentiated with the J \u2212 Ks color\nas stars are brighter in J and YSOs brighter in Ks . Dust clumps may appear as extended\nemission or have no point-like counterparts in the ISPI Ks image. These dust clumps are\nunlikely to have highly embedded massive YSOs since none of them have bright 24 \u03bcm point\nsources as would have been expected for such YSOs; however, they may have YSOs with\nlower masses. As a reference, Herbig Ae stars of A0-type at different evolutionary stages\nwould have been detected, because AB Aur and Lk H\u03b1 25 (Hillenbrand et al. 1992) placed\nat the LMC distance would have Ks = 16.9 and 18.6, respectively, and the photometric\nlimit of our Ks images at 10-\u03c3 level is \u223c 17.6 mag and the 3-\u03c3 detection limit is . 19.0 mag\n(Gruendl & Chu 2009). Aided by the ISPI images, we find that 16 of our 52 YSO candidates\nare interstellar dust clumps, and another 7 are stars projected near dust clumps.\n\n3.3.\n\nMassive YSOs and Their Classification\n\nThe results of our examination of 52 YSO candidates are given in Table 4, which lists\nsource name, ranking of the brightness at 8 \u03bcm, magnitudes in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, 24,\nand 70 \u03bcm bands, source classification, and remarks. Each source's magnitudes in the U, B,\nV , I, J, H, Ks bands are given in Table 5. Note that some of the YSOs appear as single\nsources in IRAC images but are resolved into multiple sources in high-resolution ISPI and\nVLT/NACO images; for these sources, the photometric measurements in Table 5 were made\nfor the dominant YSO sources, i.e., the brightest Ks sources with the reddest J \u2212 Ks colors.\nThe \"Flag\" in Table 5 gives the origin of data from which JHKs are measured. The results\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nof YSO identification are shown in the [8.0] versus ([4.5]\u2212[8.0]) CMD (Figure 3b). Among\nthe 52 YSO candidates, we identified 2 background galaxies, 16 dust clumps, and 7 stars\nsuperposed on dust. After excluding these sources, 27 YSO candidates remain. As these are\nmost likely bona fide YSOs, we will simply call them YSOs in the rest of the paper.\nFollowing the classification scheme proposed in Paper I, we have further categorized\nthese YSOs into Type I, II, and III by analyzing their properties and corresponding SED\nplots. Type I YSOs have SEDs with a steep rise from the near-IR to 24 \u03bcm as the radiation\nis mostly from their circumstellar envelopes. They are generally not visible in the optical\nor J-band, but are visible in the Ks -band and bright at 24-70 \u03bcm. Type I YSOs are often\nfound in or behind dark clouds. Type II YSOs have SEDs with a low peak in the optical and\na high peak at 8-24 \u03bcm corresponding to stellar core and circumstellar disk, respectively,\nafter the envelope has dissipated. Type II YSOs are faint in the optical, but bright in the\nJ-band to 8 \u03bcm, and then faint again at the 24 \u03bcm. Type III YSOs have SEDs peaking in\nthe optical with a modest amount of dust emission in the near- to mid-IR as they are largely\nexposed but still possess remnant circumstellar material. Their brightness fades in the longer\nwavelength and they are often surrounded by H II regions. The results of our classification\nof 27 YSOs are also given in Table 4. Multi-wavelength images and SEDs of these YSOs\nhave been shown in Gruendl & Chu (2009), though differences exist in some SEDs between\ntheirs and this study due to the inclusion of aforementioned deeper near-IR catalogs and\nthat 24 \u03bcm upper limits were estimated for a few YSOs in order to better constrain model\nfitting to these SEDs as discussed later in \u00a74.\n\n3.4.\n\nComparison with YSO Samples Identified by Others\n\nN 159 contains the first extragalactic protostar discovered by Gatley et al. (1981) using ground-based near- to mid-IR JHKL\u2032 photometry; this protostar corresponds to our\nYSO 053959.34\u2212694526.3. Using sensitive Spitzer observations, more YSOs in N 159 have\nbeen identified using various methods by Jones et al. (2005), Whitney et al. (2008), and\nGruendl & Chu (2009). Gruendl & Chu (2009) used the same Spitzer data and selection\ncriteria, and identified 25 YSOs. Our assessments retain two more sources in the YSO sample, 053952.60\u2212694517.0 and 054050.85\u2212695001.9, which were classified as a diffuse source\nand a background galaxy in their list. The reclassification is aided by the ISPI JKs images\nand IRSF JHKs photometry. For source 053952.60\u2212694517.0 which was previously considered as (bright) stars superposed on a dust clump, the ISPI images show a faint red source\n(Ks \u223c 17.0 and J \u2212 K \u223c 0.3) resolved from nearby bright stars within the IRAC PSF.\nFor source 054050.85\u2212695001.9 whose SED was once composed of only a nearly flat slope\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nover 3.6\u201324 \u03bcm, the inclusion of IRSF JHKs photometry makes its SED (Figure 5) more\nconsistent with a YSO than a galaxy.\nJones et al. (2005) identified YSO candidates by comparing source locations in the\n([3.6]\u2212[4.5]) versus ([5.8]\u2212[8.0]) color-color diagram with those expected from low-mass YSO\nmodels (Allen et al. 2004) . They studied a smaller region centered on the prominent central\nH II regions, within which we find 21 YSOs while they find only five YSO candidates. In\nFigure 4a, we mark the locations of their five YSO candidates and our YSOs in the 8 \u03bcm\nimage of N 159, and in Figure 4b we compare their sources with ours in the [8.0] versus\n([4.5]\u2212[8.0]) CMD. All of their five YSO candidates fall within the YSO wedge bounded by\n[4.5]\u2212[8.0] \u2265 2.0 and [8.0] \u2265 14.0\u2212([4.5]\u2212[8.0]), and form a subset of our YSO sample. To\ninvestigate why the majority of our YSOs in N 159 are missed in their study, we further\ncompare our sources with their photometric catalog (Tables 1 and 2 in Jones et al. 2005).\nWe find that the discrepancy between our and their YSO lists is attributed to both different\nselection criteria for point sources and different criteria for YSOs. Jones et al. used stringent\nparameters in the automated search for point sources, discarding any source that appear\nirregular compared with the IRAC PSF; this omitted eight of our YSOs, including three\nbright sources with [8.0] < 8.0. Only 13 of our 21 YSOs were identified as point sources in\ntheir catalog, and only five of these were also classified as YSOs by Jones et al. Of the remaining eight point sources, four were classified by Jones et al. as H II regions because their\n8 \u03bcm images were slightly more extended than the PSF; three sources were not classified\nas they did not have photometric measurements in all four IRAC bands; and one was not\nselected as YSO because its [5.8]\u2212[8.0] color was \u223c 0.2 mag bluer than those expected for\nClass I low-mass YSOs. However, we find the SED of this last source, 053940.78\u2212694632.0\nin Figure 5, to be consistent with those of bona fide YSOs.\nThe comparison with the YSO sample of Whitney et al. (2008) is not straightforward\nas they used a complex set of criteria. Within N 159, they found only 4 YSO candidates.\nThese four YSO candidates are also marked in Figure 4. The differences between our and\ntheir YSOs can be summarized as the following:\n1. Within the YSO wedge bounded by [4.5]\u2212[8.0] \u2265 2.0 and [8.0] \u2265 14.0\u2212([4.5]\u2212[8.0]), we\nfind 27 YSOs, while Whitney et al. (2008) find only 3 YSO candidates, a subset of our\nsample. To investigate why the majority of the YSOs in N 159 are missed in Whitney\net al., we further compare our sources with their original catalog, i.e., the SAGE point\nsource catalog. We find that only one missed YSO results from different selection\ncriteria, and the rest from defining point sources and applying signal-to-noise (S/N)\nthresholds when making final lists in these two studies. The SAGE catalog, similar to\nJones et al., used stringent parameters for the automated search for point sources and\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nWhitney et al. applied a high S/N threshold to select YSO candidates. The former\ndiscards any irregular point sources compared to IRAC PSFs, resulting in only 14 of our\n27 YSOs retaining in the SAGE catalog. The latter tends to exclude sources near bright\nneighbors or over bright background, since varying backgrounds (Figure 4a) raises\nphotometric uncertainties and the SAGE pipeline reports conservative S/N ratios. The\nS/N ratios are further reduced by applying additional 10% and 30% uncertainties\nrespectively to 5.8 and 8.0 \u03bcm measurements (Whitney et al. 2008), resulting in only 4\nof the 14 sources being included in their list of YSO candidates. One of these 4 sources\ndoes not match their set of selection criteria and hence is not included as a YSO in the\nWhitney et al. (2008) catalog. However, the SED of this source, 054000.69\u2212694713.4\nin Figure 5, is consistent with bona fide YSOs.\n2. One YSO candidate, W991 (SSTISAGE1CJ053945.37\u2212694802.3), of the Whitney et al.\nsample was rejected by our more restrictive color-magnitude criteria for YSO selection\nthat are intended to increase reliability though at the expense of missing some of the\nmore evolved YSOs.\nThe photometric extraction method used for this work (from Gruendl & Chu 2009) and\nPaper I has allowed the inclusion of marginally extended sources and sources amid a complex\ninterstellar background in our initial photometric catalog. Considering that 1\u2032\u2032 =0.25 pc in\nthe LMC, it is often inevitable that within the IRAC PSF a YSO is blended with circumstellar outflows or interstellar features. Furthermore, YSOs in multiple systems or YSOs in\nultracompact or compact H II regions (see \u00a74.2.2 for a detailed discussion) are likely to be\nmeasured as a single source. While it is necessary to relax the search criteria for point sources\nin the LMC to obtain the most complete census of YSOs possible, the relaxed search also\nrequires that individual sources are examined carefully in order to remove diffuse sources or\nlocal peaks in the dusty interstellar medium.\nThe color criteria commonly used for identifying low-mass YSOs, as applied in Jones et al.\n(2005), are too stringent for massive YSOs, particularly when they are at early evolutionary stages. As shown in models of massive YSOs, such emission is dominated by massive\nenvelopes and hence SEDs peak toward wavelengths longer than 24 \u03bcm. These SEDs have\na generally rising slope at shorter wavelengths such as IRAC bands of 3.6\u20138.0 \u03bcm, but show\nstructures depending on, e.g., the detailed geometry of the dust distribution (Whitney et al.\n2004). The YSO selection method used in our study should make our YSO list relatively\ncomplete for the region of the [8.0] vs. ([4.5]\u2212[8.0]) CMD analyzed. It will however miss\nsources outside this region, i.e., the less embedded, more evolved, or less massive (. 4M\u2299 )\nYSOs, as discussed in Paper I. The Whitney et al. (2008) analysis covers bluer and fainter regions in the [8.0] vs. ([4.5]\u2212[8.0]) CMD, and thus may find YSOs that we have not analyzed,\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nbut confusion from evolved stars and background galaxies in these regions is more severe and\ncareful consideration of complementary information is needed to distinguish between YSOs\nand contaminants.\n\n4.\n\nDetermining YSO Properties from Model Fits of SEDs\n4.1.\n\nModeling the SEDs\n\nThe observed SED of a YSO can be compared with model SEDs, and the best-fit models\nselected by \u03c72 statistics can be used to infer the probable ranges of physical parameters for the\nYSO. We use a grid of dust radiative transfer models calculated with the HOCHUNK MonteCarlo code (Whitney et al. 2003), each containing a point source photospheric emitter (premain-sequence or main-sequence spectrum), a flared circumstellar disk, a flattened rotating\nenvelope, and a bipolar cavity (see Robitaille et al. 2006, for details). The fitting can be\ncarried out with the fitting tool Online SED Fitter2 (Robitaille et al. 2007). The input\nparameters of the SED fitter include the fluxes of a YSO and uncertainties of the fluxes.\nThe uncertainty of a flux has two origins: the measurement itself and the absolute flux\ncalibration. The fluxes and their measurement errors are given in Tables 4 and 5. The\ncalibration errors are 10% in U, 5% in B, V , 10% in I, J, H, Ks , 5% in 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0\n\u03bcm, 10% in 24 \u03bcm, and 20% in 70 \u03bcm (Zaritsky et al. 2004; Skrutskie et al. 2006; Kato et al.\n2007; IRAC Data Handbook; MIPS Data Handbook). The total uncertainty of a flux is thus\nthe quadratic sum of the measurement error and the calibration error. We have used the\nabove SED fitting tool to analyze the 27 YSOs in our sample. 22 of them appear single or\nare clearly the dominant source within the IRAC PSF, making comparisons with single-YSO\nmodels plausible. The remaining five either have no dominant YSOs or contain luminous\nnon-YSO sources such as background stars or dust clumps within the IRAC PSF, making\nsingle-YSO models suspect. Although the total luminosities from well-reproduced SED fits\nto these five YSOs should still be good approximations, given the complicated nature, they\nare not discussed further in detailed comparisons with models.\nThe best-fit and acceptable SED models of the 27 YSOs are shown in Figure 5, in which\nthe 22 \"single\" YSOs are arranged in the order of Types I, I/II, II, II/III, and III from our\nempirical classification, and within each type by order of increasing [8.0] magnitude, and the\n5 \"multiple\" YSOs are arranged by order of increasing [8.0] magnitude. In each panel, data\npoints are plotted in filled circles and upper limits are plotted in filled triangles; error bars\n2\n\nThe Online SED Fitter is available at http://caravan.astro.wisc.edu/protostars/sedfitter.php.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nare plotted but they are usually smaller than the plot symbols. The best-fit models, with\nminimum \u03c72 (\u03c72min , see Robitaille et al. 2007, for definitions of \u03c72 ), is shown in solid black\nline, and the radiation from the stellar core reddened by the best-fit foreground extinction\nAV is shown in dashed black line. For most YSOs, their SEDs can be fitted similarly well by\na range of models. We have used a cutoff of \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min \u2264 3 for acceptable models and they\nare plotted in gray lines.\nThe results of the SED model fits are given in Table 6, where the YSOs are listed in\nthe same order as Figure 5. The source name, [8.0] magnitude, and type from our empirical\nclassification are listed on the left of the table, and selected physical parameters of the\nbest-fit models are listed to the right, i.e., the stellar parameters in mass, temperature, and\nradius (M\u22c6 , T\u22c6 , and R\u22c6 ), envelope accretion rate (\u1e40env ), disk mass (Mdisk ), AV , and total\nluminosity (Ltot ). In addition to the parameters of the best-fit model, we have also used\nthe acceptable models to show a possible range of stellar mass and total luminosity. We\ncalculated weighted average M\u0304\u22c6 and L\u0304tot using the \u03c72 values as weights, and defined the\nuncertainty to be the weighted standard deviation \u2206M\u22c6 and \u2206Ltot of the accepted models.\nFor each accepted model, we have also calculated the evolutionary stage using \u1e40env /M\u22c6\nand Mdisk /M\u22c6 ratios as defined in Robitaille et al. (2006), i.e., \u1e40env /M\u22c6 > 10\u22126 yr\u22121 for\nStage I sources, \u1e40env /M\u22c6 < 10\u22126 yr\u22121 and Mdisk /M\u22c6 > 10\u22126 for Stage II sources, and\n\u1e40env /M\u22c6 < 10\u22126 yr\u22121 and Mdisk /M\u22c6 < 10\u22126 for Stage III sources. We then calculated the\nrange of evolutionary stage, Stage Range, with the same weighted scheme for average and\nstandard deviation. These ranges of stellar mass, total luminosity, and evolutionary stage\nare also given in Table 6. Among these three quantities, total luminosity is most robust.\nMass depends on pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks, which may introduce a sysmtematic\noffset, and although the mass of warm circumstellar dust is relatively robust, its translation\ninto an accretion rate and evolutionary state depends on the applicability of the single-YSO\ndust geometry used in our radiative transfer models.\nThe SED fits of the 22 \"single\" YSOs, as displayed in Figure 5, show different degrees\nof goodness-of-fit among our empirically defined YSO types. The 18 Type I, I/II, and II\nYSOs show good agreement between model and observed SEDs, though a number of them\ndemonstrate that the observed fluxes are systematically lower than the modeled ones at 4.5\n\u03bcm. Among the four Type III YSOs analyzed, two of them show reasonable agreement in the\nSED fits, while the other two exhibit significant discrepancies between models and observed\nSEDs. The above-mentioned discrepancies and possible causes are discussed below in \u00a74.2.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nSignificant Discrepancies Between Model and Observed SEDs\n4.2.1. PAH Emission in Massive YSOs\n\nA number of YSOs in N 159 show a brightness dip at 4.5 \u03bcm in their SEDs (Figure 5).\nThis is similar to YSOs in Paper I, and has been suggested that the apparent dip is not\nan absorption feature but caused by raised fluxes from PAH emission at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, and\n8.6 \u03bcm in the other three IRAC bands, and the difference between observed and modeled\nSEDs is due to models not including PAHs or small grains. The existence of PAH emission\nin massive YSOs in the LMC has been confirmed in a recent study using Spitzer InfraRed\nSpectrometer (IRS) observations (Seale et al. 2009). Furthermore, PAH emission appears\nto almost ubiquitously present among massive YSOs, as it is detected in 87% of 277 IRS\nspectra of massive YSOs. We examined the IRS spectra of Seale et al. (2009) and found\nthat 28 of 29 YSOs in N 44 (Paper I) and 11 of the 11 YSOs in N 159 show PAH emission in\ntheir IRS spectra, confirming our explanation of the 4.5 \u03bcm dip in SEDs as a result of PAH\nemission in the other three IRAC bands.\nWhile including PAHs and small grains in YSO models is in progress (e.g., Wood et al.\n2008), we can use IRS spectra to estimate the uncertainty in deriving physical parameters of\nYSOs with current models. We have selected YSO 053935.99\u2212694604.1 for illustration since\nthis source is bright enough to ensure accurate photometric measurements and its SED shows\nan obvious dip at 4.5 \u03bcm. Furthermore, this YSO has no silicate absorption at 10 \u03bcm in the\nIRS spectrum (Seale et al. 2009) so that the contribution of PAH emission can be estimated\nby direct comparison between photometric data and the spectrum. The photometric SED\nand IRS spectrum of YSO 053935.99\u2212694604.1 are shown in Figure 6a, where PAH emission\nat 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3 \u03bcm are marked. Although 4.5 \u03bcm is outside of IRS's spectral range,\nthis photometric datapoint appears to be consistent with the continuum level extending from\nthose around 10 and 15 \u03bcm. We thus assumed that the difference between the photometric\ndatapoints at 5.8 and 8.0 \u03bcm and the underlying continuum level is entirely due to PAH\nemission and derived a factor of 1.8 for the (PAH+continuum)/continuum ratio. We divided\nthe observed fluxes at 3.6, 5.8, and 8.0 \u03bcm by this factor and modeled the PAH-corrected\nSED. The model fits to the YSO's SED before and after the PAH correction is shown in\nFigures 6b and c; the PAH-corrected SED is well reproduced by YSO models.\nThe results of the fits are listed in Table 7, including \u03c72 -weighted average and standard\ndeviation of stellar mass, total luminosity, envelope accretion rate, and Stage Range. All\nfour but one parameter inferred from fits to SEDs before and after PAH correction are in\ngood agreement. The exception is \u1e40env , whose value is larger before the PAH correction;\nhowever, this parameter is poorly constrained. This result is understandable since the raised\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nfluxes from PAH emission in the three IRAC bands is compensated by additional amount of\nlarger dust grains incorporated in the models and hence the larger \u1e40env , and the ambiguous\ngeometry of dust distribution (in disk or envelope) causes the large uncertainties in \u1e40env .\nNonetheless, the other three main parameters are not sensitive to this contamination and\nthus the conclusions based on stellar mass, total luminosity, and Stage Range derived from\nmodel fits to observed SEDs without PAH corrections are not compromised.\n\n4.2.2. Discrepancies in Type III YSOs\nAmong the four Type III YSOs, two show significant discrepancies between the best-fit\nmodels and the observed SEDs: 053945.18\u2212694450.4 and 054004.40\u2212694437.6 (Figure 5).\nThese two YSOs have SEDs agreeing with the stellar photospheric emission in near-IR\nbut deviant in optical bands. To understand the cause of this discrepancy, we examine\navailable high-resolution optical images, i.e., the 4m MOSAIC H\u03b1 and archival HST images. These images show that both YSOs have already formed compact H II regions. YSO\n053945.18\u2212694450.4 has a small H II region of diameter \u223c 4.\u2032\u2032 8 (=1.2 pc), resolved in the\nMOSAIC H\u03b1 image. YSO 054004.40\u2212694437.6 coincides with the compact H II region the\nPapillon Nebula (Heydari-Malayeri et al. 1999) of diameters \u223c 4.\u2032\u2032 4 \u00d7 2.\u2032\u2032 8 (= 1.1pc \u00d7 0.7 pc),\nresolved in both MOSAIC and HST images.\nFor both YSOs, the optical UBV I photometry were adopted from MCPS catalog. This\ncatalog used broad-band images taken with a CCD camera of a 0.\u2032\u2032 7 pixel\u22121 scale and under\nseeings of 1.\u2032\u2032 2-1.\u2032\u20328 (Zaritsky et al. 2004). Thus, compact H II regions of radii . 2\u2032\u2032 are\nunlikely to be resolved from the central stars. Bright nebular emission lines such as H\u03b2\nwould have significant contribution to B and V bands, and hence these fluxes deviate from\nstellar models, resulting in larger uncertainties in physical parameters inferred from SED\nfits. Furthermore, the presence of H II regions also suggests that the dust emission can have\nan interstellar, instead of circumstellar, origin. Thus, the inferred envelope accretion rate\nand disk mass are less reliable, and so is the Stage. This is similar to the YSO associated\nwith a small H II region resolved by HST in N44, YSO 052207.3\u2212675819.9 (Paper I). These\nresults signify the importance of using high-resolution H\u03b1 images to reveal small H II regions\nthat are responsible for the dust emission and indicate the last evolutionary stage as a YSO\napproaches the main sequence stage. On the other hand, the good agreement among mass\nestimates for YSO 052207.3\u2212675819.9 using different independent methods demonstrates\nthat for a SED relatively well reproduced by models (and hence a good estimate for the total\nluminosity of the system), the mass of the central star inferred from SED fits remains reliable.\nThis is likely the case for YSO 053945.18\u2212694450.4. As for YSO 054004.40\u2212694437.6, the\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nsystem is more complicated and will be discussed in \u00a74.3.\n\n4.3.\n\nMultiplicity Effect on SED Fits \u2013 Modeling a Group of YSOs\n\nAt the LMC's distance of 50 kpc, IRAC's \u223c 2.\u2032\u2032 0 angular resolution translates into 0.5\npc, which can hide a small group of YSOs. Indeed, 10 of the YSOs are resolved by our ISPI\nimages (with a 0.\u2032\u2032 3 pixel\u22121 scale) into multiple sources or even small clusters within the IRAC\nPSF. Another 10 YSOs appear more extended than the ISPI PSF; two of these have NACO\nimages available and both are resolved into multiple sources. These results suggest that at\nleast 44% and up to 74% of the IRAC-identified YSOs are multiple sources. Similarly high\nfractions, 50\u201365%, have been reported for YSOs in N44 (Paper I) and for 82 LMC YSOs\nwhich have archival HST H\u03b1 images available (Vaidya et al. 2009). While the ISPI and\nNACO JKs images allow us to identify the dominant YSO in a multiple system for accurate\nphotometric measurements, the IRAC measurements correspond to the integrated light of\nall sources within the PSF. This mismatch is not problematic if one YSO dominates the\nemission in IR bands; however, if two or more YSOs are present within the IRAC PSF, the\nSED modeling can produce very uncertain results. Below we use two examples to illustrate\nthe extent of errors caused by multiplicity.\nThe YSO 053941.89\u2212694612.0 in N 159 appears extended in the ISPI JKs images and\nis resolved into four sources within 0.\u2032\u2032 6 in the NACO J images. Among these four, the two\nbrightest sources (#123 and #121 in N 159-A7, Testor et al. 2006), have Ks = 13.31 and\n13.52 and J \u2212 Ks = 4.80 and 4.22, respectively; the extremely red colors originate from\ninfrared excess unless the foreground extinction was exceedingly high, so these are most\nlikely YSOs. Therefore, 053941.89\u2212694612.0 can be used to assess uncertainties in SED\nfitting for cases where two YSOs of comparable properties exist within the IRAC PSF. We\nconstruct SEDs for these two bright sources, 053941.89\u2212694612.0a and b, using JKs from\nTestor et al. (2006) and IRAC/MIPS fluxes proportioned according to their Ks mag; the\nlatter assumption is reasonable since both YSOs have very red J \u2212 Ks colors indicating early\nevolutionary stages. Model fits to these two SEDs are shown in Figure 7, along with fits to\nthe SED of integrated fluxes of the multiple system. All three SEDs have similarly good fits.\nThe results of the SED fits are listed in Table 7. The stellar mass inferred from the\nSED of integrated fluxes is 32 M\u2299 , and those for the individual a and b components are 27\nand 25 M\u2299 , respectively. Component a makes up . half of the total light in near-IR and\nhas an inferred mass \u223c 84% of that from the SED of integrated fluxes. Thus, for a source\ncontaining multiple YSOs at similar evolutionary stages such as 053941.89\u2212694612.0, the\ninferred mass for individual (most massive) YSO could be overestimated by \u223c 20%, and the\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ntotal YSO masses may be underestimated by \u223c40%.\nThe second example of multiplicity in a YSO source is 054004.40\u2212694437.6 in N 159B,\nor the Papillon Nebula (Henize 1956; Heydari-Malayeri et al. 1999). HST images revealed\na complex H II region around 054004.40\u2212694437.6. Heydari-Malayeri et al. (1999) used\nthe integrated H\u03b2 flux of the H II region (assuming ionization-bounded) and determined\nthat the spectral type of the ionizing source(s) of N 159B is at least O8 V or earlier, while\nIndebetouw et al. (2004) reported an O6V ionizing star based on the integrated radio centimeter continuum flux of N 159B. The clumpy morphology seen in the HST images suggests\nthat ionizing photons may leak from this region; thus the O8V spectral type is a lower limit.\nAs illustrated in Figure 7d, our single-YSO model fails to simultaneously reproduce the midIR dust emission and the optical light. The latter, adopted from the relatively low-resolution\nMCPS catalog, is almost certainly contaminated with nebular line emission from the ionized\ngas that is not included in the YSO models.\nTo separate the central point source of 054004.40\u2212694437.6 from the surrounding nebulosity, we use photometric measurements made with HST images in the optical and VLT/NACO\nadaptive optics images in Ks . At other IR bands, we use the IRSF JH measurements as\nupper limits, and IRAC and MIPS fluxes as they are. The resultant SED and model fits are\nshown in Figure 7e, and the inferred YSO mass is \u223c 21 M\u2299 (Table 7). The SED fitting is\nbiased toward HST data points as they have smaller errors compared with those of Spitzer\ndata points. It is thus not surprising that the YSO mass is consistent with the B0/O9 spectral type implied by the HST UbyI photometry. In fact, Heydari-Malayeri et al. (1999) and\nTestor et al. (2007) have already suggested that the point source detected in HST images,\nwhich is also the brightest source in the VLT/NACO Ks image within the IRAC PSF, does\nnot account for the full luminosity or the centimeter radio flux of the nebula.\nAs the optically brightest star in 054004.40\u2212694437.6 may not be the YSO contributing\nto the observed mid-IR emission, we decouple the mid-IR part of the SED from the rest and\nmake SED fits to only the mid-IR segment. This is essentially using the luminosity of dust\nemission as a calorimeter to infer the effective luminosity of the main energizing source(s)\nwithout specifically trying to separate those sources from the H II region. The result should\nbe consistent with the spectral type derived from the total radio continuum emission from the\nH II region. Figure 7f shows that the mid-IR part of the SED can be reproduced by models\nreasonably well, and the inferred mass, \u223c 41 M\u2299 (Table 7), is indeed in agreement with the\nO6V spectral type derived from radio observations (Indebetouw et al. 2004). Therefore, the\nmain ionizing sources of the Papillon Nebula are still hidden behind a large amount of dust.\nIn summary, when a YSO is in a multiple system, it is crucial to use high-resolution\noptical and near-IR images to assess whether the multiple components are at different evolu-\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\ntionary stages. If the dominant sources are at similar YSO stages, model fits of the integrated\nSEDs would overestimate the mass of the most massive YSO but underestimate the total\nmass of the YSOs. On the other hand, if multiple sources at different evolutionary stages are\npresent, the optical and near-IR emission may be dominated by the exposed stars and the\nmid-IR emission dominated by more embedded YSOs. Under these circumstances, model\nfits to the mid-IR portion of the SED can still provide useful information on the dominant\nheating sources. Lastly, we note that since only one case in each of these two types of system is investigated, our estimates on mulitiplicity effect is thus approximate and a better\nquantification requires a larger sample. A cautionary corollary of our result is that the uncertainties would be even larger in mass estimates for YSOs of three or more comparably\nbright objects, such as the 5 multiple YSOs that are already resolved in the ISPI JKs images\nsince each single source could be further resolved into multiples in even higher resolution\n(e.g., the aforementioned NACO) images.\n\n4.4.\n\nEvolutionary Stage of YSOs\n\n4.4.1. Comparisons among Empirical, Theoretical, and Spectral Classifications\nWe use our analysis of 22 \"single\" YSOs to compare our empirical classification, Type,\nwith the theoretical classification, Stage (Robitaille et al. 2006). As listed in Table 6, Types\nand Stages are only loosely correlated. This lack of overwhelming correspondence is also\nseen in Paper I and may be attributed to two reasons primarily related to the relatively\nlarge distance of the LMC. In an unresolved cluster treated as a single source, details of the\ncircumstellar dust geometry may not correspond extremely well to our model prescription,\nmaking the translation of fitted dust mass into an accretion rate (quantitative Stage) less\ncertain. On the other hand, a Type determined from environmental morphology on parsec\nscale may also not accurately reflect the evolutionary state of a single YSO. The methods\nare both useful, neither definitive. Second, limited angular resolution may cause inclusion of\nextraneous dust emission from unresolved H II regions. This is particularly relevant to YSOs\nat a late evolutionary stage, such as the three Type III YSOs that show small H II regions\nin the MOSAIC H\u03b1 images; the mid-IR emission from unresolved H II regions would have\nbeen erroneously modeled as circumstellar disks or envelopes. Nevertheless, we expect the\nextreme Stage I YSOs to correspond to our Type I YSOs, since they are deeply embedded\nin massive envelopes. Indeed, Table 6 shows that Type I YSOs are well fitted by Stage I\nmodels. We also expect Type III YSOs without H II region confusions to correspond to\nStage III YSOs, and indeed this is the case for 054000.69\u2212694713.4.\nWe also use the 11 YSOs with IRS observations to compare our empirical classification\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nwith the classification based on spectral features (Seale et al. 2009). Table 8 lists their\nspectral classification and the presence of silicate absorption. Among the 11 YSOs, 10\nhave spectral type PE, whose spectra show PAH and fine-structure line emission, and 1 has\nspectral type P, whose spectrum shows PAH emission but not fine-structure line emission.\nOur empirical classification for the 10 YSOs with PE-type spectra cover Types I, I/II, II,\nand III, indicating that the ionized gas can be present early on. Compared with PE-Type\nYSOs, the P-Type YSOs may have an earlier evolutionary stage because of a higher accretion\nrate that quenches the formation of an H II region or have a stellar temperature too low\nto provide ionizing flux (Seale et al. 2009). The P-type YSO in N 159, 053929.21\u2212694719.0,\nis classified as Type I, and additional evidence is presented in \u00a74.4.2 to suggest that this\nP-type YSO is in an earlier evolutionary stage than the PE-Type YSOs. The strongest\nspectral feature that correlates with our empirical classification is the silicate absorption.\nThe presence of silicate absorption is an indication of early evolutionary stage (Seale et al.\n2009). The five YSOs in N 159 that show silicate absorption are all of Types I and I/II. They\nare also all of Stage I and have high \u1e40env , 7.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u2212 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 /yr (Table 6), inferred\nfrom SED modeling, bolstering their evolutionary stage being early. Thus, our classification\nusing multiwavelength SEDs and images suggests an evolutionary sequence consistent with\nthat implied by classification based on spectra features.\n\n4.4.2. Evolutionary Stages of YSOs Associated with Masers and Ultracompact H II\nRegions\nMassive stars inject energy into the surroundings even during their formation. They\nundergo energetic mass ejection in the form of molecular outflows and produce maser phenomenon. They can also ionize the circumstellar gas to form small, dense H II regions such\nas ultra-compact H II regions (UCHIIs) with diameters \u2264 1017 cm and densities \u2265 104 cm\u22123\n(Franco et al. 2000). In N 159, a H2 O maser source and three UCHIIs have been identified\n(Lazendic et al. 2002; Indebetouw et al. 2004), and each of these four objects is spatially coincident with a massive YSO (Figure 8a). The link between these objects and YSOs allows\nus to compare the YSOs' evolutionary stages inferred from SED models to the circumstellar conditions required to form masers or UCHIIs, providing an independent check for the\nfeasibility of SED models.\nThe H2 O maser in N 159 was first reported by Hunt & Whiteoak (1994) and confirmed\nwith subarcsecond resolution and accurate position by Lazendic et al. (2002). It coincides\nwith our Type I YSO 053929.21\u2212694719.0 within 1\u2032\u2032 . As listed in Table 9, this YSO has a\nhigh mass of 26.1\u00b11.5 M\u2299 and a high \u1e40env of (5.1\u00b11.5)\u00d710\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 derived from model\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nfits to its SED. The high \u1e40env indicates it as a Stage I YSO. Its IRS spectrum is classified as\nType P (Table 8), as it does not show any fine structure lines from ionized gas (Seale et al.\n2009). The high mass of the stellar core implies that it does emit ionizing radiation; however,\nthe high envelope accretion rate suggests that the circumstellar H II region is most likely too\nsmall to become detectable with our large beam. The analysis of the YSO's SED leads to\nthe conclusion that YSO 053929.21\u2212694719.0 is in an early evolutionary stage. Indeed, it is\ncommonly accepted that the water maser phase precedes the UCHII phase (Ellingsen et al.\n2007). Therefore, the production of the water maser and the YSO's SED models all point\nto a consistent picture that 053929.21\u2212694719.0 is at a very young evolutionary stage.\nThree UCHIIs have been identified in N 159: B0540\u22126946(1), B0540\u22126946(4), and\nB0540\u22126946(5) (Indebetouw et al. 2004). All three UCHIIs are coincident with Spitzer\nsources within 1\u2032\u2032 , and these sources have been identified as Type I, II/III, and III YSOs\n(Table 9). As these sources are among the five most luminous YSOs in N 159 at 8.0 \u03bcm,\nthey are also bright in the 24 and even 70 \u03bcm images from which reliable measurements are\nneeded to constrain model fits to their SEDs. The stellar luminosities determined from the\nbest-fit SED models can be translated into spectral types, assuming the relationship for main\nsequence stars. These spectral types can be compared with those implied by the ionizing\nfluxes determined from radio continuum observations (Indebetouw et al. 2004). As seen in\nTable 9, agreement exists between the spectral types independently determined with these\ntwo methods.\nThe development of a UCHII depends on not only the ionizing flux provided by the\ncentral star, but also the opacity of the circumstellar medium. For infalling rates higher\nthan some critical value, \u1e40crit , the circumstellar medium will have such high opacities that\nthe ionized region will be too small and too optically thick to be detectable (Churchwell\n2002). For the respective spectral types of the central stars, the \u1e40crit of the three UCHIIs\nin N 159 are computed to be \u223c 3 \u2212 7 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Table 9). Compared to the \u1e40env\ndetermined from the best-fit models (Table 6) or weighted average \u1e40env determined from\nall accepted models (Table 9) for these three YSOs, it is seen that all three YSOs have\n\u1e40env \u226b \u1e40crit . We have further examined whether any acceptable models of the three\nYSOs yield smaller envelope accretion rates. We find that all the other acceptable models\nhave \u1e40env \u226b \u1e40crit . This is similar to that found for 3 of the 4 UCHIIs associated with YSOs\nin N 44 (Paper I).\nThere could be two causes for \u1e40env \u226b \u1e40crit . One is that most of the infalling envelope\nmaterial is used in forming an accretion disk as modeled by Yorke & Sonnhalter (2002),\nand the ionizing radiation escapes in the polar directions. The other is that at the LMC\ndistance, it is difficult to distinguish bound, circumstellar dust from more distant but still\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nheated interstellar dust. The warm envelope of an UCHII contributes to the mid-IR emission\nmodeled in the SED, and raises the derived accretion rate. Thus, the high envelope accretion\nrates of YSOs associated with these UCHIIs and the H2 O maser mostly suggest that they\nstill have abundant dust/gas in the surroundings and have not significantly cleared their\nenvironments. In terms of evolutionary sequence, we find that the maser is associated with\nType I while UCHIIs are associated with Types I, I/II, and III; this is consistent with the\ngeneral picture that the maser phase happens earlier than UCHII (Ellingsen et al. 2007).\nAlthough the SED of the maser source is probably also contaminated by hot dust in the\nenvironment that may not actually accrete onto the protostar.\n\n4.4.3. Evolutionary Stages of YSOs as Herbig Ae/Be stars\nHAeBe stars are intermediate-mass young stars that have evolved from the most embedded phase and are now revealing their stellar components (e.g., Hillenbrand et al. 1992).\nSince our YSO sample overlaps this mass range, we examine whether some of them might\nbe previously classified as HAeBe stars. Candidate HAeBe stars in N 159 have been selected\nby Nakajima et al. (2005) using near-IR JHKs photometry. Figure 8a shows their locations\nmarked on an 8 \u03bcm image of N 159, along with our YSOs marked in different colors to\nindicate their evolutionary stages. Figure 8b and c show color-color and color-magnitude\ndiagrams using JHKs photometry of sources in N 159 that are detected in all three bands\n(kindly provided by Yasushi Nakajima; Nakajima et al. 2005). As listed in Table 8, nine\nof these candidate HAeBe stars are identified as YSOs and they have the following types\nof SEDs: one Type I, one Type I/II, five Type II, and two Type III. The majority (78%)\nof these HAeBe candidates are Type II and III YSOs, consistent with the expectation that\nsuch objects are less embedded. There are also two candidate HAeBe stars that we classify as non-YSO sources: 053921.21\u2212694409.4 is a star superposed on dust clumps, and\n053938.80\u2212694436.0 is the O7 III stellar counterpart of the high-mass X-ray binary LMC\nX-1 (Cowley et al. 1995). The latter clearly is not a young star, and this explains why its\ncolors are bluer than the other HAeBe stars (see Figure 8b and c).\n\n4.5.\n\nMasses of YSOs\n\nThe mass estimates from the best and acceptable fits of 27 YSOs in N 159 are listed\nin Table 6. Among them, 22 YSOs have single or dominant sources within the IRAC PSF\nand their SEDs can be properly approximated by single-YSO models to obtain reliable mass\nestimates. The other five have SEDs from multiple YSOs or even non-YSO sources such as\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nstars or nebulosities; their mass estimates have larger uncertainties and should be viewed\nas rough estimates. Nevertheless, the results of SED fits show that twenty of the YSOs\nin N 159 have \u03c72 -weighted average mass greater than 8 M\u2299 and thus are most likely bona\nfide massive YSOs. The remaining seven have \u03c72 -weighted average < 8 M\u2299 and are likely\nintermediate-mass YSOs.\nIt has been suggested that the criterion [8.0] \u2264 8.0 may be used to select massive YSOs\nin the LMC (Gruendl & Chu 2009). We find that indeed the \u03c72 -weighted average mass of the\nbrightest YSOs, with [8.0] \u2264 8.0, are all \u2265 8 M\u2299 . This criterion may be too conservative, as\nall (15 out of 15) YSOs with [8.0] \u2264 9.0 still have masses \u2265 8 M\u2299 The results are consistent\nwith what we found for YSOs in N 44 (Paper I).\nAt the high-mass end, nine YSOs have \u03c72 -weighted average mass > 17\nmost likely O-type YSOs. Two YSOs have \u03c72 -weighted average mass close\nlarger standard deviation that extending beyond 17 M\u2299 ; these may or may\nstars. Therefore, there exist at least 9 O-type YSOs in N 159. These most\nwill be discussed further in \u00a75.1.\n\n5.\n\nM\u2299 ; these are\nto 17 M\u2299 and\nnot be O-type\nmassive YSOs\n\nMassive Star Formation in N 159\n\nIt is difficult to study the relationship between interstellar conditions and the formation\nof massive stars because massive stars' UV radiation fluxes and fast stellar winds quickly\nionize and disperse the ambient ISM. Young massive YSOs that have not significantly altered the physical conditions of their large-scale environments can be used to probe massive\nstar formation. The large number of massive YSOs found in N 159 provides an excellent\nopportunity to investigate issues such as the relationship between star formation properties and interstellar conditions, progression of star formation, and evidence of triggered star\nformation.\n\n5.1.\n\nInterstellar Environments and Star Formation Properties\n\nWe examine the star formation properties of the molecular clouds in N 159 as these\nclouds contain the bulk material to form stars. The SEST and MAGMA CO surveys of the\nLMC (Johansson et al. 1998; Ott et al. 2008) show three large concentrations of molecular\nmaterial in N 159, i.e., the eastern, western, and southern peaks (Figure 9). These three\nconcentrations exhibit different numbers of massive stars formed in the last 10 Myr, as\nevidenced by their different amounts of ionized gas. The eastern molecular peak is associated\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nwith bright H\u03b1 emission from the prominent central H II regions. Star formation has been\noccurring in this \u223c 35 pc \u00d7 50 pc region for an extended period of time, as it contains both\nevolved and young massive stars. For example, star #54 of Fari\u00f1a et al. (2009) is a B1-2\nIV-II star that is \u223c 10 Myr old, while their star #62 is an O4-6 Vn star that is . 3 Myr\nold (Schaerer et al. 1993; Schaerer & de Koter 1997). The western molecular peak has only\nseveral small, disjoint H II regions, but one of them, N 159A, has the highest H\u03b1 surface\nbrightness in the entire N 159. The massive stars in N 159A and its surroundings have been\nimaged in UBV and their colors and magnitudes indicate that their spectral types range\nfrom B2 V to O5\u20136 V (Deharveng & Caplan 1992). Given the absence of SNRs, these stars\nare most likely . 5 Myr or that star formation started only in the last few Myr. The southern\nmolecular peak only has a couple of small H II regions, indicating that only modest massive\nstar formation has taken place.\nFigure 9 shows that 96% (= 26/27) of YSOs in N 159 are found within CO contours \u2265\n1 K km s\u22121 . This corresponds to an H2 column density of \u2265 4 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , for a CO-to-H2\nconversion factor XCO = 3.9 \u00b1 2.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 in the molecular ridge which\nincludes N 159 (Pineda et al. 2009). About 70% of the YSOs are congregated toward the\nthree molecular peaks, similar to the 75% found in N 44 (Paper I). The YSOs of the three\nmolecular peaks show different characteristics in their spatial distributions and interstellar\nenvironments. The western molecular peak has the highest concentrations of YSOs, as 12\nYSOs are found within \u223c 1.\u2032 5 (= 22 pc)-radius of the CO contour peak and 6 of them cluster\nin a small region of 40\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 80\u2032\u2032 (=10 pc \u00d7 20 pc) over the bright H II region N 159A and\nits north tip N 159AN. The eastern molecular peak has more widely distributed YSOs, and\nmost of them are associated with H II regions. The southern molecular peak has 4 YSOs\nthat are loosely distributed, and they are not associated with any ionized gas.\nThe YSOs of the three molecular peaks in N 159 also show differences in their mass\ndistributions. In Figure 9, we have marked the YSOs with circles in three sizes that represent\nO-type stars with inferred M\u0304\u22c6 \u2265 17M\u2299 , (early) B-type stars with 17 > M\u0304\u22c6 \u2265 8M\u2299 , and\nintermediate-mass stars with M\u0304\u22c6 < 8M\u2299 . We found \u223c 80% of the O- and B-type YSOs in\nN 159 are in or adjacent to H II regions, similar to those seen in N 44 (Paper I). The YSOs\nwith intermediate masses or without mass estimates do not show such preferred association\nwith H II regions, but this may be caused by an observational bias against the detection\nof these fainter intermediate-mass YSOs over the bright background dust emission in H II\nregions. The western and eastern molecular peaks, associated with bright H II regions, have\na respectable number of O- and B-type YSOs, while the southern molecular peak has one\nYSO with mass \u223c 8M\u2299 and no O-type YSOs at all.\nSimilar to the trend seen in N 44 (Paper I), the characteristics of the current star for-\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nmation in the three molecular peaks of N 159 appear to be dependent on the massive star\nformation that occurred in the recent past. We have further examined whether the pattern\nof star formation is related to the physical properties of molecular clouds. The eastern, western, and southern molecular concentrations contain GMCs N 159-E, N 159-W+N 159-2, and\nN 159-S+N 159-3, respectively (Johansson et al. 1998). Their physical properties adopted\nfrom Johansson et al. (1998) are listed in Table 10, including each GMC's local standard\nof rest velocity (Vlsr ), CO line-widths (\u2206V ), virial mass (Mvir ), luminosity mass (Mlum ),\nand ratio of virial to luminosity mass. Note that Mlum is converted from the CO luminosity LCO using Mlum = 8.8 \u00b1 5.6LCO M\u2299 , revised from Equation (6) in Bolatto et al. (2008)\nfor an XCO value suitable for N 159 (Pineda et al. 2009). In addition, when there are two\nGMCs in a molecular concentration, we use averages of Vlsr and \u2206V and sums of Mvir and\nMlum , respectively, to represent the properties of a concentration. For comparisons, in Table 10 we have also listed these quantities for GMCs in N 44 (Mizuno et al. 2001), where\nthe Mlum is converted from the CO luminosity LCO using Mlum = 15.8 \u00b1 4.5LCO M\u2299 for\nXCO = 7 \u00b1 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 (Fukui et al. 2008).\nThe GMC N 159-W has the smallest \u2206V and Mvir /Mlum ratio, which can be an indicator of lower gravitational support, and contains the largest number and most concentrated\ndistribution of massive YSOs. Similarly, the GMC N 44-C has YSO properties like N 159-W\nand also has a smaller Mvir /Mlum ratio among the GMCs in N 44. The larger sample of\n36 LMC GMCs in Indebetouw et al. (2008) showed a similar trend of more star formation\nactivity at lower Mvir /Mlum . This may reflect preferred physical conditions for GMCs to\ncollapse and form a concentrated cluster, qualitatively consistent with the picture that a\nsmaller turbulent kinetic energy results in larger volumes exceeding the Jeans criterion for\ngravitational instability (e.g., Klessen et al. 1998). The similar values in \u2206V and Mvir /Mlum\nratios found in the other two GMCs in N 159 do not seem to scale with their different star\nformation activity, although the uncertainties in the virial analysis are large compared to the\ndifferences between the GMCs. Detailed mapping of these three GMCs could reveal some\nof the physics underlying their different star formation characteristics. In particular, observations of denser gas tracers such as HCO+ and HCN reveal the virial ratios and physical\nconditions of the clumps that are actively participating in star formation, whereas bright\nCO emission can also come from more diffuse or photo-dissociation regions of the GMC.\nHigh-resolution (\u223c 5\u2032\u2032 ) HCO+ observations of N 159-E and W have shown that dense clumps\nare spatially correlated with YSOs at early evolutionary stage (Chen et al, 2010, in preparation), and new observations of N 159-S taken in October 2009 will reveal whether dense\nclumps are present in this GMC as well.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n5.2.\n\nMassive Star Formation \u2013 Triggered or Spontaneous?\n\nA number of observational studies have demonstrated that the current star formation\nmay be triggered by stellar energy feedback, such as through the expansion of an H II region\n(e.g., Zavagno et al. 2007; Pomar\u00e8s et al. 2009). N 159 experiences intense energy feedback\nevidenced with the filamentary structure in the H II regions (Figure 1) and the existence of\nSNR 0540\u2212697 (Chu et al. 1997; Williams et al. 2000). N 159 also has abundant molecular\nmaterial for continued star formation. It is conceivable that its (main-sequence) massive\nstars photonionize the ambient gas to form H II regions and the raised thermal pressure can\ncompress the neighboring molecular cloud to trigger star formation. In fact, as shown in\nFigure 9, about 2/3 of the YSOs are associated with H\u03b1 emission and almost all of them are\nin the eastern and western GMCs. In contrast, none of the four YSOs in the southern GMC\nare associated with H II regions. To investigate whether some of the current star formation\nin the eastern and western molecular concentrations may have been triggered, we compare\nthe distributions of YSOs relative to the massive stars, and use high-resolution MOSAIC H\u03b1\nimages to examine the immediate environment of YSOs.\nThe eastern GMC is associated with the prominent central H II regions in N 159. This\nregion has 17 spectroscopically identified massive stars (Fari\u00f1a et al. 2009). As shown in\nthe MOSAIC H\u03b1 image in Figure 10a, these massive stars are distributed in the bright\nnorthern and southern lobes of the central H II region, while the YSOs are mostly found\nalong the edges of an east-west oriented low-surface-brightness band between the two lobes.\nAs this band coincides with the peak of the GMC, the spatial distributions of YSOs appear\nto suggest that their formation is likely triggered by the expansion of two H II regions (lobes)\ninto a central molecular cloud. To test this hypothesis, we used two methods to search for\nmassive stars in the central molecular cloud that were formed earlier before the external\npressure was raised but are too obscured to be detected at optical wavelengths.\nWe first use the 3 cm map to search for obscured O stars, since it is nearly extinctionfree signpost of gas ionized by massive stars. Figure 10a reveals that the 3 cm emission\nof N 159 (Dickel et al. 2005; Seward et al. 2010) appears diffuse for a 22\u2032\u2032 resolution over\n(mature) massive stars in the bright H II regions, but shows four peaks in the east-west\ncentral band and the western molecular concentration. Three of the four 3 cm peaks are\ncentered at O-type YSOs associated with UCHIIs (Indebetouw et al. 2004). The remaining\n3 cm peak, i.e., the faintest peak in the east-west band, is centered between two non-O-type\nYSOs and has no UCHIIs detected. The absence of UCHIIs indicates that these YSOs have\nlower masses than the detection limit of a B0 V star, or that the H II regions of optically\nobscured OB stars are too extended and thus resolved out by the small synthesized beam\n(Indebetouw et al. 2004).\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nWe next consider the candidate OB stars identified with JHKs photometry (Nakajima et al.\n2005). Figure 10b shows that some of them are distributed around, though not inside the\neast-west band. To assess whether there might be OB stars hidden by extinction even in\nthe near-IR, we use the H\u03b1 and 3 cm maps to estimate the extinction. Assuming that the\n3 cm emission of N 159 is completely thermal3 , the extinction in the H\u03b1 emission, AH\u03b1 , of a\n10,000 K H II region can be estimated using\nAH\u03b1 = \u22122.5log (\n\nFH\u03b1 jH\u03b1\n/\n),\nS3cm j3cm\n\n(1)\n\nwhere jH\u03b1 /j3cm = 8.86\u00d710\u221210 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 Jy\u22121 and then converted to the visual extinction\nusing AV = 1.24AH\u03b1 (Caplan & Deharveng 1986). Figure 10b shows the visual extinction\nmap and its peak value is . 5.0 in the east-west band. For a standard extinction curve\nof AJ /AV = 0.28 and AK /AV = 0.11, an O8 V star would have J = 16.1 and K = 15.1\n(Schmidt-Kaler 1982; Koornneef 1983), brighter than the catalog's 10-\u03c3 limiting magnitudes\nof J = 18.8 and K = 16.6 (Nakajima et al. 2005), and would have been detected if the\nlocal variation in the extinction is within a factor of 3, i.e., AV \u223c 15. As for massive\nYSOs which usually have [8.0] \u2264 9.0, a foreground extinction of AV = 5.0 corresponds to\nA8.0 = 0.24 (Indebetouw et al. 2005) and imposes little effect on their detection. The above\nconsiderations suggest that the peak of the eastern GMC was not active in producing O-type\nstars a few Myr in the past and only began to form them currently in locations on the edges\ncontacting H II regions. Thus, the formation of the YSOs in the GMC N 159-E is likely\ntriggered.\nIt is interesting to note that YSOs 054003.49\u2212694355.0 and 054004.40\u2212694437.6 in\nNGC 159-E are projected within and at the edge of SNR 0540\u2212697 (Figure 10a). For this\nSNR to be responsible for the formation of these two YSOs, its age has to be longer than\nthe ages of YSOs. The age of this SNR, estimated from its size and expansion velocity, is\n\u223c 1 \u2212 2 \u00d7 104 years (Williams et al. 2000). The absolute ages of the YSOs are difficult to\nestimate. However, the brighter and more massive of the two YSOs, 054004.40\u2212694437.6,\nhas formed a small H II region visible in the optical wavelength, i.e., the Papillon Nebula\n(Heydari-Malayeri et al. 1999), and hence its age is likely to be more than several 105 years\n(Churchwell 2002). The fainter and less massive of the two YSOs has evolved beyond the\nearliest evolutionary stage and thus unlikely to be younger than a few 105 years. The age\nconsideration suggests that the SNR is unlikely to be responsible for the formation of these\ntwo YSOs.\n3\n\nThis assumption is likely to result in an overestimate of the extinction as there is contamination of\nnon-thermal emission from the nearby SNR 0540\u2212697 (Seward et al. 2010).\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nThe western GMC in N 159 abuts the central H II regions. For the expanding H II\nregions to trigger star formation in this molecular concentration, the crossing time scale\nshould be shorter than the ages of massive stars and YSOs. Figure 10a shows that the\nboundary of the H II regions is & 40\u2032\u2032 , or a projected distance of 10 pc from the massive\nstars and YSOs. For this distance and a velocity dispersion \u03c3 of 2.6 km s\u22121 of the GMC\nN 159-W (from \u03c3 = 0.43\u2206V and \u2206V = 6 km s\u22121 , Johansson et al. 1998), the traverse time\nis \u223c 4 Myr. This time scale is not shorter than the age of OB stars in the bright nebular\ncomponent N 159A, \u223c 3 \u2212 4 Myr, indicated by the presence of a spectroscopically identified\nO8 star and a few photometrically identified mid- to late-O stars (Deharveng & Caplan 1992;\nSchaerer & de Koter 1997; Fari\u00f1a et al. 2009). Thus it is not likely that the expansion of\nthe central H II regions is responsible for the formation of these massive stars. Furthermore,\nYSOs in the western GMC are concentrated in the molecular core, in contrast to the YSOs\nin the eastern GMC that are spread out and distributed along the interface between the\nmolecular cloud and H II region.\nIt has been suggested that the star formation in N 159 started near the center of the\ndiffuse radio emission where OB stars identified with JHK photometry are located, and\nproceeded outwards to trigger next-generation star formation in the eastern and western\nGMCs (e.g., Jones et al. 2005; Nakajima et al. 2005). Our detailed analysis finds a more\ncomplicated pattern of star formation. The expansion of the central H II region has triggered\nthe star formation in the eastern GMC, but not the western GMC. It is possible that the star\nformation in the western GMC was triggered by some force that is no longer identifiable, such\nas an old SNR whose shock velocity had slowed down to 20\u201345 km s\u22121 (Vanhala & Cameron\n1998). It is also known that in an active star forming region, the environment is usually\ntoo complex to pinpoint the triggering mechanism for star formation (Desai et al. 2010).\nNevertheless, based on the distribution of YSOs concentrated near the core of the western\nGMC as well as its lowest velocity dispersion (kinetically cold) among GMCs in N 159, we\nsuggest that its star formation may have started spontaneously. This suggestion is further\nsupported by the most massive stars formed in the western GMC, as shown below.\nA trend is observed in YSOs in H II regions in the Milky Way and the LMC that in triggered star formation, the second generation is less massive than the first (e.g., Pomar\u00e8s et al.\n2009; Fleener et al. 2010). In N 159, the most massive YSO formed in the eastern GMC,\n054004.40\u2212694437.6, is O6 V (Indebetouw et al. 2004), not as massive as the earliest type\nO4-6 Vn found in the central H II region (#54 in Fari\u00f1a et al. 2009). The most massive YSO\nformed in the western GMC, 053937.53\u2212694609.8, is O5.5V (Indebetouw et al. 2004), more\nmassive than the only spectroscopically classified O8 star4 in the bright H II region N 159A\n4\n\nDeharveng & Caplan (1992) suggested another star as mid- to late-O type based on its U BV colors and\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n(Fari\u00f1a et al. 2009). The spectral types derived from radio continuum by Indebetouw et al.\n(2004) may be underestimates if significant ionizing flux is leaking from the UCHII, and\nthere is a systematic uncertainty in converting from ionizing flux to spectral type due to\ndifferences in massive stellar atmosphere models. However, the comparison of most massive\nYSOs and main-sequence stars in these two GMCs suggests that the eastern GMC is more\nconsistent with the aforementioned trend than the western GMC. In cases of spontaneous\nstar formation, the masses of YSOs do not depend on the masses of stars that were formed\nearlier in the molecular cloud. It is thus the cloud properties that determine the types of\nstars formed, though once massive stars are formed, their energy feedback can trigger further massive star formation as demonstrated in the eastern GMC. These two factors can\nnaturally result in massive YSOs preferentially found in GMCs associated with H II regions\nas the GMCs likely already have conditions to form massive stars and can form even more\nwith the aide of stellar energy feedback.\n\n5.3.\n\nStar Formation Efficiency and Rate\n\nThe correlation or lack thereof between GMC properties in galaxies and their star formation activity is of critical importance to understand galaxy evolution and star formation\nin general. In particular, we need to understand the physics underlying the empirically\nobserved correlation between star formation rate and gas surface density, the \"SchmidtKennicutt\" (S-K) relation (e.g., Kennicutt 1989; Calzetti et al. 2007; Kennicutt et al. 2009).\nThis correlation is tight when properties are averaged over a kpc or more, but it is difficult to justify why it should hold on sub-kpc scales. Only recently have datasets been rich\nenough to explore the smaller scales. The THINGS project (Walter et al. 2008) found that\nwhether molecular or total (= molecular + atomic) gas surface density is a better predictor of star formation depends on which is the dominant phase in that part of the galaxy\n(Leroy et al. 2008), and in molecular regions, star formation scales linearly with H2 surface\ndensity (Bigiel et al. 2008).\nLarge-scale star formation in a galaxy depends on the formation rate of GMCs and how\nGMCs collapse to form stars. Theoretical models assuming that GMCs have a constant star\nformation efficiency within a free-fall timescale find that GMC formation is the dominant\ndriver in the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies, and that the S-K relation can be reproduced (Krumholz et al. 2009). It is of fundamental importance to determine how and when\nGMCs collapse to form stars. Only a small number of detailed extragalactic studies have\nmagnitudes, however such conversion is known to have large uncertainties (e.g., Massey 1985).\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nbeen made. In N 44 (Paper I), N 159 (this study), and the LMC's quiescent molecular ridge\n(Indebetouw et al. 2008), we find that although most massive young stars are found near\npeaks in 12 CO emission, there is not always a clear correlation between 12 CO properties and\nYSO properties. In N 44 and N 159, massive YSOs are mostly found in GMCs associated\nwith ionized gas. In N 44, the most massive GMC N 44-S has \u223c 5-times the cloud mass but\nonly half the YSO content of N 44-C; in N 159, the most massive GMC N 159-S formed only\na few YSOs and none of them are massive (Table 10). The current star formation activity\nappears to correlate more with the energy feedback from antecedent massive stars than the\nmass of a GMC. Indebetouw et al. (2008) found that in the molecular ridge, the SFR measured from either integrated mid-IR light or detailed analysis of the YSOs is correlated with\nthe Mvir /Mlum ratio, an indicator of gravitational support. However, the total SFR measured from the integrated light is far below that expected from the S-K relation for the given\nGMC surface density. The molecular ridge is known for its anomalously low star formation\nactivity, but the GMCs in N 44 and N 159 host a range of star formation activities and may\nbe used to investigate whether the S-K relation applies on scales of individual GMCs.\nThe known massive YSO content allows us to assess the instantaneous star formation\nefficiency, SFEYSO , of a GMC. We use the number counts of YSOs within different mass bins\nand the assumption of Salpeter's initial mass function (IMF) to estimate the total mass of\ntotal\nthe current star formation, MYSO\n. The lowest mass bin used for counting depends on the\nphotometric completeness in a region. For regions with bright diffuse background, such as\nN 159-W and N 44-C, only higher-mass bins are used to avoid problems from photometric\nincompleteness at < 9.0 mag, though at the expense of small number statistics. The brightness limit [8.0]= 9.0 corresponds to \u223c 8M\u2299 (recall masses of YSOs inferred from SED fits in\ntotal\n\u00a74.5). The total mass, MYSO\n, is calculated by integrating the initial mass function from Ml\n= 1 M\u2299 to Mu , the highest mass of YSO observed. We adopt the commonly used lower mass\nlimit of 1 M\u2299 to facilitate comparisons with other work, although the formation time scale\ntotal\nof a 1 M\u2299 star is much longer than that of the observed massive YSOs. The MYSO\nis then\ndivided by the virial mass of the GMC (Mvir ) to obtain SFEYSO , and all these three quantotal\ntities are listed in Table 10. Uncertainties in MYSO\nare also listed; they are directly related\nto the uncertainty in mass inferred for individual massive YSOs used in number counts and\nare thus estimated from the largest and small mass ranges covered by these massive YSOs.\nTo determine the SFR from the total mass of current star formation requires a timescale.\nAlthough we can constrain the age of each massive YSO from its evolutionary stage, statistics\nof solar-mass YSOs in Class I, II, III, and models of high-mass protostellar accretion, such\nages are quite uncertain aside from being . 1 Myr. On the other hand, since we consider\nall YSOs with high and intermediate masses within each GMC that are currently forming\nin a burst, this seems more relevant to the formation timescale of a cluster or association.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nProceeding with this assumption and assigning a cluster formation time (tcluster ) of \u223c 1 Myr\n(e.g., Bonnell et al. 2003), we derive the current star formation rate, SFRYSO . We have also\nestimated SFE per free-fall time (tff ),\n\u01ebff =\n\ntotal\nMYSO\ntcluster Mvir\n\ntff\n\n(2)\n\n(e.g., Huff & Stahler 2007) which has gained popularity recently as a normalized measure of\nstar formation activity. Note that the angular resolution for CO data of N 44 and N 159 are\ndifferent: N 44 was observed at 145\u2032\u2032 angular resolution while N 159 at 45\u2032\u2032 resolution. Thus,\nin N 44, multiple GMCs may not be resolved, resulting in much larger GMC size and longer\ntff . Table 10 shows that the SFEYSO for GMCs in N 44 and N 159 are low, \u223c 0.0002 \u2212 0.009.\nAs a comparison, the molecular cloud associated with the Pipe Nebula, a very low-level\nGalactic star formation region, has SFEYSO \u223c 0.0006 for YSOs \u2265 0.3M\u2299 (Forbrich et al.\n2009); the SFEYSO found in N 44 and N 159, after multiplied by a factor of 1.7-2 to account\nfor a lower mass limit extending to 0.3M\u2299 under the Salpeter's IMF assumption, are \u223c 1\u221225\ntimes that in the Pipe Nebula. The \u01ebff is also low, mostly \u223c 10\u22124 to 10\u22123.\nFor comparison, we have also estimated the SFR associated with each GMC using\nintegrated H\u03b1 and 24 \u03bcm fluxes with the prescription of Calzetti et al. (2007),\nSFRH\u03b1+24 (M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 5.3 \u00d7 10\u221242 [L(H\u03b1)obs + (0.031 \u00b1 0.006)L(24 \u03bcm)],\n\n(3)\n\nwhere L(H\u03b1) and L(24 \u03bcm) are H\u03b1 and 24 \u03bcm luminosities in ergs s\u22121 , respectively. To\nmeasure the H\u03b1 and 24 \u03bcm luminosities, we use an aperture size to include the bulk of a\nGMC; the largest uncertainties come from flux calibration, i.e., 5-10% in H\u03b1 and 10% in 24\n\u03bcm (Sean Points, private communication; MIPS Data Handbook). The aperture size, H\u03b1\nand 24 \u03bcm luminosities, SFRH\u03b1+24 in M\u2299 yr\u22121 , and normalized SFRH\u03b1+24 in M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122\nare all given in Table 10. Among the 6 GMCs, three have SFRYSO higher than SFRH\u03b1+24 .\nTwo of these three GMCs, N 44-N and N 159-S, have low star formation activities in the\noptical and near-IR wavelengths, similar to that seen in the molecular ridge (N 159-S is\nat the north tip of the molecular ridge). As suggested in the study of molecular ridge\n(Indebetouw et al. 2008), such difference likely results from the lower luminosity to mass\nratios in the regions studied. In N 44-N and N 159-S, star formation occurred mostly in lowermass or less rich clusters. As these clusters do not fully sample the high-mass end of the\nstellar initial mass function, they have a lower luminosity to mass ratio than the rich clusters,\nwhich are analyzed in Calzetti et al. (2007). In GMCs like N 44-N and N 159-S, SFRH\u03b1+24\nwould severely underestimate the star formation rate by almost an order of magnitude. The\nthird GMC with SFRH\u03b1+24 < SFRYSO , N 159-W, has massive main-sequence stars, and it is\nstill actively forming new massive stars (\u00a75.2), similar to the three GMCs with SFRH\u03b1+24 >\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\nSFRYSO . The ratios of current-to-past massive star formation rates, SFRYSO /SFRH\u03b1+24 , of\nthese four GMCs range from 0.4 to 2.1. These ratios suggest that the current star formation\nrate may be lower or even higher than the average star formation rate in the last few Myr,\nnot constant over time. In active star forming GMCs, SFRH\u03b1+24 would miss the current star\nformation, which amounts to 30\u201370% of the total star formation rate (calculated from the\nabove four GMCs).\nFinally, we use the star formation properties of the GMCs to evaluate the S-K relation.\nThe normalized SFR expected from the S-K relation for a region is:\nSFR(M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 ) = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 (\n\n\u03a3\n)1.4\nM\u2299 pc\u22122\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the sum of molecular and atomic gas surface densities (Kennicutt 1998). The\naverage molecular surface densities are measured from CO maps, adopting XCO = 7 \u00d7\n1020 and 3.9 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 for N 44 and N 159 from Fukui et al. (2008) and\nPineda et al. (2009), respectively. The atomic surface densities are measured from HI maps\n(Kim et al. 2003). Then the expected SFRs from the total gas surface densities, SFR\u03a3 , are\ngiven in Table 10. As shown in Figure 11, among the six GMCs, four of them have SFR\u03a3 and\nSFRH\u03b1+24 in agreement within a factor of 3. The remaining two GMCs, N 44-N and N 159-S,\nhave SFR\u03a3 \u223c 11 and 56 times SFRH\u03b1+24 , respectively. When compared with SFRYSO , which\nis a better estimate of SFRs in these two low-luminosity regions, N 44-N is within a factor of\n2 of SFR\u03a3 , while N 159-S is still only 1/5 SFR\u03a3 . The GMC N 159-S appears very different\nfrom the other five GMCs as its star formation rate, estimated with a comprehensive YSO\ninventory, is still much lower than that expected from the S-K relation. It is known that the\nS-K relation does not apply to small regions; thus is is not surprising that these GMCs with\nregion sizes ranging from 45 to 135 pc do not follow the S-K relation in star formation. It\nis interesting that the SFR averaged over all GMCs within the entire N44 complex or the\nentire N159 complex is very close to that expected from the S-K relation.\n\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have studied the H II complex N 159 in the LMC with Spitzer IRAC and MIPS data\nat 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, 24, 70, and 160 \u03bcm and CTIO Blanco 4 m ISPI in the JKs and MOSAIC\nin the H\u03b1 bands. Following procedures outlined in Paper I, we first identified YSOs using the\ncriteria [4.5]\u2212[8.0] \u2265 2.0 to exclude normal and evolved stars and [8.0] < 14.0\u2212([4.5]\u2212[8.0])\nto exclude background galaxies. A total of 52 YSO candidates were identified. We then\ninspected the SED and close-up images of each YSO candidate in H\u03b1, V RIJKs , IRAC,\nand MIPS bands simultaneously to further identify evolved stars, galaxies, and dust clumps,\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nresulting a sample of 27 YSO candidates that are most likely bona fide YSOs of high and\nintermediate masses. We classified these YSOs into Type I, II, and III according to their\nSED shapes.\nIn our sample of 27 YSOs, \u223c 74% of them are resolved into multiple components or\nextended sources in high-resolution JKs images. To assess the physical properties of the\nYSOs, we have used the Online SED Model Fitter (Robitaille et al. 2007) to model SEDs of\nthese YSOs and further analyzed in detail 22 YSOs that appear single or dominant within\na group. We find good fits for Types I and II YSOs, though they show modest deviations\nbetween their observed SEDs and the models at 5.8 and 8.0\u03bcm, because the models do not\ninclude PAH emission. We have used a YSO with a Spitzer IRS observation to estimate the\nfraction of PAH emission in IRAC 3.6, 5.8, and 8.0 \u03bcm bands and modeled the SED with\naromatic emission removed. That SED is well fit by the models, and comparisons between\nSEDs before and after PAH correction show that mass and total luminosity of the YSO is\nnot significantly affected by including PAHs in models.\nSome of the Type III YSOs show large deviations from the models at optical wavelengths.\nThis is due to the modest angular resolution of the MCPS UBV I catalog since the nebular\nline emission from small H II regions surrounding massive YSOs is not resolved from the\npoint source and contributes to the broad-band photometry. We have also examined the\neffect of multiplicity (due to inadequate angular resolution) on inferring parameters of YSOs\nfrom SED fits by modeling a group of YSOs resolved in the VLT/NACO adaptive optics\nJKs images. We find that for a YSO of multiple sources at similar evolutionary stages,\nthe integrated fluxes may result in up to 20% over-estimate in mass of the most massive\ncomponent, but up to \u223c 40% under-estimate in the total mass of the system. For a YSO\nof sources at mixed evolutionary stages, the mid-IR luminosity is a good estimate for the\nsystem's total luminosity, but high-resolution optical and near-IR images are needed to\nseparate main-sequence components from the YSO components.\nYSO counterparts are found in one maser, three UCHIIs, and nine candidate HAeBe\nstars. The maser is associated with a Type I YSO and the majority of the HAeBe stars\ncorrespond to Type II and III YSOs, supporting the evolutionary sequence of our empirical\nclassification. The maser has IRS spectral features similar to the \"P\" group classification\nused in Seale et al. (2009), while the three UCHIIs are similar to the \"PE\" group. Masers\nare typically associated with YSOs less evolved than UCHIIs, supporting the proposed spectral evolutionary sequence that YSOs with the \"PE\" spectral type are more evolved than\nthose with the \"P\" spectral type. We have further found that for YSOs associated with\nultracompact H II regions, (proto) stellar masses determined from SED model fits agree well\nwith those estimated from the ionization requirements of the H II regions. Using the SED\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\nmodel fits, we find at least 9 O-type YSOs in N 159.\nN 159 encompasses three molecular concentrations with different star formation histories\nand intensities. O-type YSOs are found in the two GMCs that are associated with ionized\ngas, i.e., where massive stars have formed a few Myr ago, while no O-type YSOs are found\nin the third GMC that shows no signs of massive star formation in the optical and near-IR\nwavelengths. This result is similar to that seen in YSOs in the three GMCs in N 44 (Paper\nI), indicating that energy feedback plays a role in the formation of massive YSOs. However\nit remains unclear whether the less active GMCs will form massive stars later. Although the\nuncertainties in \u2206V are large, the GMC N 159-W does have the smallest \u2206V and Mvir /Mlum\nratio and also contains the largest number and most concentrated distribution of YSOs,\nconsistent with the hypothesis that concentrated clusters are formed in a less gravitationally\nstable region. A smaller Mvir /Mlum ratio is also found in the GMC N 44-C which has the\nhighest number and the most concentrated distribution of YSOs.\nTo investigate whether star formation may be triggered or spontaneous in GMCs in\nN 159, we have performed a detailed comparison between the mid-IR YSO distribution and\nthe distribution of already formed massive stars and their associated ionized gas. We find\nthat the current star formation in the GMC N 159-E is likely to be triggered by H II regions\nexpanding into the molecular cloud, while the massive YSOs in GMC N 159-W are more\nlikely forming spontaneously.\nFinally, we estimated star formation efficiencies and rates by counting the massive YSOs,\nand compared these rates to those inferred from integrated H\u03b1 and 24 \u03bcm luminosities.\nWe also compared with expected rates calculated from gas surface densities and using the\nSchmidt-Kennicutt extragalactic scaling relation. In GMCs with relatively high levels of\nactivity, such as N159 -E and -W, the various measures are consistent. However, in more\nquiescent regions such as N 159-S and the giant molecular ridge which continues south from\nthere, we find that star formation is distributed in relatively low luminosity regions and\ndominated by current (mid-IR detected) star formation, with a lack of massive main-sequence\nstars (representing few-Myr old activity). Star formation rates derived from YSO counting\nare higher than those predicted by total H\u03b1 and 24 \u03bcm luminosities, and both are lower than\nwould be implied by the total gas surface density. This discrepancy can be explained if the\nstar formation sites are poor clusters which do not fully sample the stellar mass function (so\ntheir mass-to-light ratios are elevated). Alternatively, the youngest and most embedded still\naccreting massive protostars have elevated mass-to-light ratios due to late spectral type premain-sequence photospheres and possible having not yet accreted their final mass. Either\npossibility indicates unusual conditions in N 159-S and a breakdown of the scaling laws\ndetermined by averaging over kiloparsec scales in galaxies. Detailed studies such as this of\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\narchival Spitzer data, soon to be complemented by detailed molecular gas properties obtained\nwith ALMA, are revealing the full complexity of extragalactic star formation.\nWe thank the anonymous referee for the careful reading of the manuscript to improve\nthe paper.

YSOs at different evolutionary stages are marked as follows:\nred circle \u2013 Type I and I/II, green circle \u2013 Type II and II/III, and blue circle \u2013 Type\nIII. Known maser and UCHIIs are marked with additional triangle and boxes, respectively\n(Lazendic et al. 2002; Indebetouw et al. 2004). Candidate HAeBe stars from Nakajima et al.\n(2005) are marked in orange dots. Candidate HAeBe stars in common with YSOs are labeled\nwith positive numbers, and those in common with non-YSO red sources (yellow pluses) are\nlabeled with negative numbers.

YSOs with different mass estimates are marked with\ndifferent symbols: O-type, i.e., M\u0304\u22c6 \u2265 17 M\u2299 , as large red open circles; early-B type, i.e.,\n17 M\u2299 > M\u0304\u22c6 \u2265 8 M\u2299 , as medium red open circles; and B-type, i.e., M\u0304\u22c6 < 8 M\u2299 , as small red\nopen circles. YSOs that appear single or are clearly the dominant source with the IRAC PSF\nare shown in solid-line circles, while YSOs that are multiple and have larger uncertainties in\nmass estimates are in dotted-line circles.\n\n\f\u2013 48 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- (a) MOSAIC H\u03b1 image of N 159 superbubble overlaid with 3 cm contours (yellow).\nThe position and size of the SNR 0540\u2212697 are marked in dashed cyan line. YSOs are marked\nin the same symbols as Figure 9. Spectroscopically identified massive stars (Fari\u00f1a et al.\n2009) are marked with triangles in three sizes to show different evolutionary stages: large\n\u2013 young phase including O4-5 V-I and O Vz, medium \u2013 middle-aged phase including O6-9\nV-I and B0 I, and small \u2013 evolved phase including B0-2 V-III and B1-8 I.

Candidate OB stars from\nNakajima et al. (2005) are marked in green squares.\n\nFig. 11.- Relation between the SFR per unit area and gas density for six GMCs in N 44 and\nN 159. Each GMC has two estimated SFRs using different tracers, SFRH\u03b1+24 (filled triangles\nand GMC name labeled) and SFRYSO (filled circles). For comparison, SFRs estimated in\nthe molecular ridge (Indebetouw et al. 2008) are also plotted, i.e., SFRH\u03b1+24 in open triangle\nand SFRYSO in open circle. The solid line is the S-K relation, and the dotted, dashed,\ndashed-dotted lines correspond to constant SFRs per unit gas mass, in units of 1%, 10%,\nand 100% per 100 Myr, commonly used in estimating SFRs of a galaxy (Kennicutt 1998).\nGMCs without prominent H II regions, i.e., N 44-N, N 159-S, and the molecular ridge, have\nSFRH\u03b1+24 11\u201356 times smaller than expected from the S-K relation, but their SFRYSO are\nin better agreement with the S-K relation.\n\n\f\u2013 49 \u2013\n\nTable 1.
