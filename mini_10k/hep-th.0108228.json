Introduction\nIn an important contribution to the burgeoning study of integrable systems in non-commutative geometry (see [3], [6], [8]), Kapustin, Kuznetsov and Orlov have generalised the Penrose-Ward twistor transform\nto that setting, [4]. The geometric parts of the construction translate fairly naturally using the standard\ntechniques of non-commutative geometry ([2],[5]), but the form (or even existence) of the non-commutative\ntwistor algebra is less obvious. In [4] such an algebra is presented using braiding properties defined by an\nappropriate R-matrix. In this note we consider the extent to which this is determined by the deformation\nof the original space-time algebra using a dual quantum group description. The ordinary twistor space and\nthe six-dimensional conformal space in which compactified Minkowski space-time is identified with the rays\nof a cone are both flag manifolds generated by the conformal group action on highest weight vectors, so we\nconsider non-commutative twistor space as a quantum flag manifold for the quantised function algebra of a\ndeformation of the conformal group [1]. We shall also give a coordinate-free expression for the R-matrix.\n\n1. The non-commutative space-time algebra\nWe recall that the non-commutative algebra for (four-dimensional) space-time M is the twisted group\nalgebra defined by a symplectic form \u03b8 on M. Its Lie algebra is generated by elements X(u) for u \u2208 M\nwhich satisfy [X(u), X(v)] = ih\u0304\u03b8(u, v)I. where I is a positive central element. Using the non-degenerate\nsymmetric bilinear form G on M we may write ih\u0304\u03b8(u, v) = G(u, \u0398v) for a suitable skew-symmetric operator\n\u0398, (which may be regarded as an element of the Lie algebra of the orthogonal group of G), so that\n[X(u), X(v)] = G(u, \u0398v)I.\nWe can also define H = 21 Gij Xi Xj (where X(u) = Xj uj in terms of coordinates and using the summation\nconvention), and calculate that\n[H, X(u)] = X(\u0398u)I.\nIn order to generalise the conformal theory it is useful to introduce a central element T such that I = T 2 ,\nand to define D = T \u22121 H, so that the commutation relations take the homogeneous form\n[X(u), X(v)] = G(u, \u0398v)T 2 ,\n\n[D, X(u)] = X(\u0398u)T,\n\ndefining a quadratic algebra. The identity 2T D = 2H = Gij Xi Xj , gives the non-commutative version of the\nquadric cone of the conformal theory.\nIn the commutative case one studies connections with self-dual curvature. This curvature vanishes on\nisotropic planes and these define twistors (projective spinors for the conformal group) T , [7]. (For an isotropic\nplane through the origin, we note that the Clifford algebra of M acts on the space of spinors. Writing \u03b3(u)\nfor the action of u \u2208 M we may consider the \"vacuum\" vector \u03a8\u03be \u2208 T with the property that \u03b3(u)\u03a8\u03be = 0\nfor all u in the plane defined by \u03be \u2208 \u22272 M, that is for u \u2227 \u03be = 0. Since \u03a8 is determined only up to multiples\n1\n\n\fthis gives a ray, and defines a point of the projective space of T . Isotropic planes through other points can\nbe obtained using the action of the conformal group.)\nThe space T decomposes into odd and even spinors T+ \u2295 T\u2212 . Each of the spaces T\u00b1 is two-dimensional\nso that \u22272 T\u00b1 is spanned by a single vector \u01eb\u00b1 . (We normalise these so that k\u01eb\u00b1 k2 = 2, so that when we\nchoose orthonormal bases e1 , e2 for T+ and e3 , e4 for T\u2212 we may take \u01eb+ = e1 \u2227 e2 = e1 \u2297 e2 \u2212 e2 \u2297 e1 and\n\u01eb\u2212 = e3 \u2227 e4 = e3 \u2297 e4 \u2212 e4 \u2297 e3 .)\nThe six-dimensional space \u22272 T has a natural symmetric bilinear form B defined by\nB(\u03be, \u03b7)\u01eb+ \u2227 \u01eb\u2212 = \u03be \u2227 \u03b7.\nThe action of the conformal group on \u22272 T leaves invariant the null cone B(u, u) = 0, and the rays of this\ncone form a compact complex version of space-time. (The finite points of space time can be identified with\nthe rays of the cone for which B(\u01eb\u2212 , u) 6= 0, or equivalently M can be identified with T+ \u2227 T\u2212 . For brevity\nwe shall call \u22272 T conformal space-time.)\nBy construction the orthogonal group of G has its spin representation \u0393 on T , which leaves each of T\u00b1\ninvariant, and so the forms \u01eb\u00b1 are also invariant under the spin action. We may choose the orthonormal\nbases e1 , e2 for T+ and e3 , e4 for T\u2212 so that the matrix \u0393(\u0398) is diagonal:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\n(b \u2212 a)\u03c33\n0\n1\nwhere\n\u03c3\n=\nh\u0304\n.\n3\n2\n0 \u22121\n0\n(a + b)\u03c33\nWe now complete \u01eb\u00b1 to a basis for \u22272 T by introducing \u01eb1 + i\u01eb4 = e4 \u2227 e1 , \u01eb1 \u2212 i\u01eb4 = e2 \u2227 e3 , \u01eb2 + i\u01eb3 = e1 \u2227 e3 ,\nand \u01eb2 \u2212 i\u01eb3 = e2 \u2227 e4 . With this notation {\u01eb\u03bc } forms a G-orthonormal basis of M \u223c \u22272 T when we identify\nG with \u22122B. The matrix of \u0398 with respect to this basis is given by\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec 0\nih\u0304 \uf8ed\n0\n\u2212a\n\n\uf8f6\n0 0 a\n0 b 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f8.\n\u2212b 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nUnfortunately, the commutation relations of the non-commutative theory destroy the full conformal\nsymmetry. For example, the transformations of the space M, affecting only the operators X(u), must not\nonly be orthogonal with respect to G but also be symplectic with respect to \u03b8, or equivalently commute\nwith \u0398. In general this forces them to lie in a Cartan subgroup, though, for particular \u03b8, (when a vanishes)\nthey may lie in a larger group. We must therefore deform the conformal group, or more precisely we shall\nquantise its function algebra by deforming the R matrix associated with the commutation relations. To\nmake explicit the connection between commutation relations and an R matrix, we consider for any vector\nspace U an operator R : U \u2297 U \u2192 U \u2297 U satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation, and write R = \u03a6 + R\u2032 where\n\u03a6 denotes the usual flip operator x \u2297 y 7\u2192 y \u2297 x on U \u2297 U , and R\u2032 is the deformation. The function algebra\ndefined by R is given by operators A on U which satisfy R(A \u2297 A) = (A \u2297 A)R. The following is then a\nstraightforward consequence of our definitions.\nPROPOSITION 1. The relations R(A \u2297 A) = (A \u2297 A)R of the function algebra defined by R = \u03a6 + R\u2032\nare equivalent to the commutation relations\n[he|Aui, hf |Avi] = hf \u2297 e|(A(2) R\u2032 \u2212 R\u2032 A(2) )(u \u2297 v)i,\nwhere A(2) = A \u2297 A, e, f \u2208 U \u2217 , u, v \u2208 U , and he|ui denotes the pairing between the dual spaces U \u2217 and U .\nProof: The relations R(A \u2297 A) = (A \u2297 A)R can be rewritten as\n\u03a6(A \u2297 A) \u2212 (A \u2297 A)\u03a6 = (A \u2297 A)R\u2032 \u2212 R\u2032 (A \u2297 A).\nWriting A(2) = A \u2297 A, and choosing e, f \u2208 U \u2217 , u, v \u2208 U this gives\nhf \u2297 e|(\u03a6A(2) \u2212 A(2) \u03a6)(u \u2297 v)i = hf \u2297 e|(A(2) R\u2032 \u2212 R\u2032 A(2) )(u \u2297 v)i.\n2\n\n\fThe left-hand side can be written as\nhe \u2297 f |A(2) u \u2297 vi \u2212 hf \u2297 e|A(2) v \u2297 ui = he|Auihf |Avi \u2212 hf |Avihe|Aui = [he|Aui, hf |Avi],\nso that we have the stated result.\nLet us take U = \u22272 T and write the vectors as v = v+ \u01eb+ + v0 + v\u2212 \u01eb\u2212 , with v0 \u2208 T+ \u2227 T\u2212 \u223c M. To avoid\ne and A\ne instead of R and A. We are less interested in the\nconfusion with the twistor examples we write R\nwhole function algebra than in the quantum flag manifold generated by the highest weight vector \u01eb\u2217+ of the\ne with v+ D + X(v0 ) + v\u2212 T . In this notation the commutation\ndual basis of U \u2217 , and want to identify h\u01eb\u2217+ |Avi\nrelations reduce to\n[u+ D + X(u0 ) + u\u2212 T, v+ D + X(v0 ) + v\u2212 T ] = u+ T X(\u0398v0 ) \u2212 v+ X(\u0398u0 )T + G(u0 , \u0398v0 )T 2 .\ne\u2032\nOne simple way of obtaining these is to consider the deformation given by R\n\ne \u2032 (u \u2297 v) = u+ \u01eb\u2212 \u2297 \u0398v0 \u2212 \u0398u0 \u2297 v+ \u01eb\u2212 + G(u0 , \u0398v0 )\u01eb\u2212 \u2297 \u01eb\u2212 .\nR\n\ne\u2032 = 0 and one may readily check that R\ne gives the correct\nSince this has no terms in \u01eb+ , we have h\u01eb\u2217+ \u2297 \u01eb\u2217+ |R\ncommutation relation. It is useful to note that\n\nand\n\ne\u2032 (u \u2227 v) = u+ \u01eb\u2212 \u2297S \u0398v0 \u2212 \u0398u0 \u2297S v+ \u01eb\u2212 + G(u0 , \u0398v0 )\u01eb\u2212 \u2297S \u01eb\u2212 ,\nR\ne \u2032 (u \u2297S v) = u+ \u01eb\u2212 \u2227 \u0398v0 \u2212 \u0398u0 \u2227 v+ \u01eb\u2212 ,\nR\n\ne \u2032 interchanges symmetric and antisymmetric tensors. It is also easy to check that the square of R\ne\u2032\nso that R\nvanishes. These are in accord with the following simple result.\nPROPOSITION 2. A family of deformations R = \u03a6 + R\u2032 satisfies R2 = 1, if and only if R\u2032 maps the\n2\nsymmetric tensors to antisymmetric tensors and vice versa, and R\u2032 = 0.\nProof: This is a matter of comparing terms of first and second order in R\u2032 in the identity\n2\n\n2\n\n1 = R2 = \u03a62 + \u03a6R\u2032 + R\u2032 \u03a6 + R\u2032 = 1 + \u03a6R\u2032 + R\u2032 \u03a6 + R\u2032 ,\n2\n\nwhich gives \u03a6R\u2032 + R\u2032 \u03a6 = 0 = R\u2032 . The first identity can be rewritten in the form\nR\u2032 (1 \u00b1 \u03a6) = (1 \u2213 \u03a6)R\u2032 ,\nwhich, recalling that 12 (1 + \u03a6) is the projection onto the symmetric tensor product \u22972S U and 12 (1 \u2212 \u03a6)\nprojects onto the antisymmetric tensor product \u22272 U , shows that R\u2032 maps \u22972S U to \u22272 U and \u22272 U to \u22972S U .\n(For similar reasons R\u2032 also interchanges \u22972S,R U = 21 (1 + R)(U \u2297 U ) and \u22272R U = 12 (1 \u2212 R)(U \u2297 U ).)\n2. Yang-Baxter operators for the twistors\nWe now want to find a Yang-Baxter operator R for twistor space which is consistent with that on\nconformal space-time \u22272 T . More precisely, a Yang-Baxter operator R on \u22972 T \u2217 can be extended to a Yange : \u22974 T \u2192 \u22974 T , defined by\nBaxter operator R\ne = R23 R12 R34 R23 .\nR\n\nThis interchanges the first and second pairs of factors in the tensor product, allowing one to extend the\ne for the conformal space-time \u22272 T ,\nYang-Baxter operator R for twistor space to a Yang-Baxter operator R\nR\n3\n\n\fand, for consistency, this should agree with that found above. The primary task is to see whether any such\nR exist, and to find them.\ne inherits various properties of R, but in the Appendix we show that two crucial\nIt is easy to see that R\ne\nproperties of R must be shared by R, a fact which substantially simplifies the task of finding it.\nTHEOREM 3. If a family of Yang-Baxter operators R which is a deformation of the flip \u03a6 satisfies\n[R23 R12 R34 R23 ]2 = 1, then R2 = 1, and if, in addition, R23 R12 R34 R23 commutes with \u039b(4) = \u039b \u2297 \u039b \u2297 \u039b \u2297 \u039b\nfor invertible \u039b, then R commutes with \u039b(2) = \u039b \u2297 \u039b.\n\ne2 = 1, and the invariance of the commutation\nWe have already observed that for conformal space-time R\ne\nrelations under the infinitesimal rotation \u0398 means that R commutes with \u0398 and so with the invertible\noperator \u039b = exp(s\u0398). This suggests that the non-commutative twistor algebra is defined by an operator R\nsatisfying R2 = 1, and commuting with the spin action of \u039b \u2297 \u039b = exp(s\u03981 + s\u03982 ), where \u03981 = \u0393(\u0398) \u2297 1,\ne is only defined on the subspace\nand \u03982 = 1 \u2297 \u0393(\u0398). (It is merely suggested because the space-time R\ne has an extension to the whole of \u22974 T \u2217 with the same\n\u22272R T \u2217 \u2297 \u22272R T \u2217 . There is no problem provided that R\ninvolutory and intertwining properties. Our argument will start by assuming that there is such an extension,\nand then justifying this once R has been found. Once established we can deduce that R also commutes with\ne enjoys an additional, less obvious symmetry arising from its compatibility\nthe spin action \u03981 +\u03982 .) In fact R\nwith the exact sequence: 0 \u2212\u2192 T\u2212 \u2212\u2192 T \u2212\u2192 T+ \u2212\u2192 0.\nPROPOSITION 4. Let N be a nilpotent operator on T such that im(N ) = ker(N ) = T\u2212 and let\n(4)\ne\nKs = 1 + sN . Then Ks = Ks \u2297 Ks \u2297 Ks \u2297 Ks commutes with R.\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nProof: By definition Ks acts as the identity on T\u2212 and so Ks \u01eb\u2212 = \u01eb\u2212 . By contrast Ks \u01eb+ must have the\n(2)\ngeneral form \u01eb+ +sn+s2\u03bd\u01eb\u2212 for scalar \u03bd and n \u2208 T+ \u2227T\u2212 . For u0 \u2208 T+ \u2227T\u2212 we must have Ks u0 = u0 +s\u03bb\u01eb\u2212\nfor a suitable scalar \u03bb which we shall now find. We first notice that the determinant of Ks is clearly 1, so\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\nthat for any \u03be and \u03b7 \u2208 T \u2227 T we have \u03be \u2227 \u03b7 = Ks \u03be \u2227 Ks \u03b7, and thence B(\u03be, \u03b7) = B(Ks \u03be, Ks \u03b7). In\nparticular, taking \u03be = \u01eb+ and \u03b7 = u0 gives\n0 = B(\u01eb+ , u0 ) = B(\u01eb+ + sn + s2 \u03bd\u01eb\u2212 , u0 + s\u03bb\u01eb\u2212 ) = s\u03bb + sB(n, u0 ),\n(2)\n\nso that \u03bb = \u2212B(n, u0 ) = 12 G(n, u0 ), and Ks u0 = u0 + 21 sG(n, u0 )\u01eb\u2212 .\nWe now calculate that\ne \u2032 (u \u2297 v) = Ks(4) (u+ \u01eb\u2212 \u2297 \u0398v0 \u2212 \u0398u0 \u2297 v+ \u01eb\u2212 + G(u0 , \u0398v0 )\u01eb\u2212 \u2297 \u01eb\u2212 )\nKs(4) R\n= u+ \u01eb\u2212 \u2297 (\u0398v0 + 21 sG(n, \u0398v0 )\u01eb\u2212 \u2212 (\u0398u0 + 12 sG(n, \u0398u0 )\u01eb\u2212 ) \u2297 v+ \u01eb\u2212 + G(u0 , \u0398v0 )\u01eb\u2212 \u2297 \u01eb\u2212 .\nSince G(n, \u0398u0 ) = \u2212G(u0 , \u0398n) and, in particular, G(n, \u0398n) = 0, this reduces to\ne\u2032 (Ks(4) (u \u2297 v)),\nu+ \u01eb\u2212 \u2297 \u0398v0 \u2212 \u0398u0 \u2297 v+ \u01eb\u2212 + G(u0 + 12 su+ n, \u0398(v0 + 21 sv+ n))\u01eb\u2212 \u2297 \u01eb\u2212 = R\n\ne automatically commutes with any operator \u039b(4) this gives the stated result.\nand since \u03a6\nWe also want R to satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation, but there is another requirement which is much\ne = R23 R12 R34 R23 to \u22272 T \u2217 \u2297 \u22272 T \u2217 contains only first order terms\nstronger, namely that the restriction of R\nR\nR\n\u2032\ne\nin \u0398 (that is, in R ). With the requirements that R be an involution and have the same symmetries as R,\nthis limits the possibilities considerably.\nTHEOREM 5. For non-degenerate \u0398, any Yang-Baxter operator R = \u03a6+R\u2032 satisfying R2 = 1, commuting\ne on the conformal spacetime is in the two-parameter family\nwith \u0398 and giving only first order corrections to R\nR\u2032 = \u03b1\u03981 |\u01eb\u2212 ih\u01eb\u2217+ | + \u03b2|\u01eb\u2212 ih\u01eb\u2217+ |\u03981 ,\n\nfor some scalars \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 C. These operators automatically satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation.\n4\n\n\fProof: Since R\u2032 commutes with the action of \u0398 it must preserve eigenspaces for the action. The formula\nfor \u0393(\u0398) shows that generically (unless a, b or a \u00b1 b vanishes) each symmetric tensor ej \u2297 ej is in a onedimensional eigenspace of its own, and since R\u2032 maps symmetric tensors to antisymmetric tensors we must\n(2)\nhave ej \u2297 ej \u2208 ker(R\u2032 ). However, ker(R\u2032 ) must be invariant for operators of the form Ks and by suitable\nchoices of N , Ks ej \u2297 Ks ej (j = 1, 2) generate the whole of T \u2297S T\u2212 which must therefore also lie in the\nkernel.\nGenerically, there is also is a four-dimensional null space for the action of \u0398 spanned by e1 \u2297S e2 ,\n\u01eb+ = e1 \u2227 e2 , e3 \u2297S e4 , and \u01eb\u2212 = e3 \u2227 e4 , and the other eigenspaces are two-dimensional spanned by tensors\nof the form ej \u2297S ek and ej \u2227 ek for various distinct {j, k} \u2208\n/ {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}. We have just seen that the\nsymmetric tensors are in the kernel of R\u2032 . Since R\u2032 maps antisymmetric to symmetric tensors each ej \u2227 ek\nmust map to a multiple of ej \u2297S ek . In fact, this multiple must also vanish otherwise overlapping terms such\n\u2032\n\u2032\ne so we may assume that R\u2032 (e\u2217 \u2297S e\u2217 ) = 0 and\nas R12\nR23\n(ei \u2297 ej \u2297 ek ), give quadratic contributions to R,\nj\nk\n\u2032 \u2217\n\u2217\nR (ej \u2227 ek ) = 0 for the given range of j and k.\nThe only interesting deformations therefore occur in the four-dimensional null space. Here it is useful to\nnote that \u03981 \u01eb+ = 12 h\u0304(b \u2212 a)e1 \u2297S e2 , and \u03981 \u01eb\u2212 = 12 h\u0304(b + a)e3 \u2297S e4 . (Since \u01eb\u00b1 and their duals are invariant\nunder the appropriate actions of \u03981 + \u03982 , these could equally have been written in terms of \u03982 .) We already\nknow that R\u2032 kills e3 \u2297S e4 and e3 \u2227 e4 , so, again discarding the deformations which mix the symmetric and\ne we are left with R\u2032 of\nantisymmetric products of the same vectors and lead to quadratic contributions to R,\nthe form\nR\u2032 \u01eb+ = \u03b1\u03981 \u01eb\u2212\nR\u2032 \u03981 \u01eb+ = \u03b1\u2032 \u01eb\u2212 ,\n2\n\nor, equivalently, R\u2032 = \u03b1\u03981 |\u01eb\u2212 ih\u01eb\u2217+ | + \u03b2|\u01eb\u2212 ih\u01eb\u2217+ |\u03981 . The condition that R\u2032 = 0 holds automatically as do the\nYang-Baxter equations.\ne\nWe shall next show that with an appropriate choice of constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 this is compatible with R.\ne\nSince by construction R23 R12 R34 R23 is an involution commuting with the same operators as R this verifies\ne to \u22974 T \u2217 , so justifying our working assumption.\nthat there is indeed an extension of R\n\nTHEOREM 6. The only Yang-Baxter operator for T compatible with the known Yang-Baxter operator\ne on the non-commutative conformal space-time is\nR\nR = \u03a6 + 2[\u03981 , |\u01eb\u2217+ ih\u01eb\u2212 |]+ .\n\nProof: We have noted that there are only first order corrections so the Yang- Baxter operator takes the form\ne=\u03a6\ne +R\ne\u2032 , where \u03a6\ne is the flip and\nR\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ne\u2032 = \u03a623 \u03a612 \u03a634 R23\n\u03a623 + \u03a623 R12\n\u03a634 \u03a623 + R23\n\u03a612 \u03a634 \u03a623 .\nR\n+ \u03a623 \u03a612 R34\n\n\u2032\nSince, for example \u03a623 R24 = R34\n\u03a623 , this can be rewritten as\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ne\u2032 = R14\nR\n\u03a623 \u03a612 \u03a634 + R24\n\u03a613 + R13\n\u03a624 + R23\n\u03a612 \u03a634 \u03a623 .\n\nApplying this to (u \u2227 x) \u2297 (v \u2227 y) we get\n\n\u2032\nR14\n(x \u2297 y \u2297 u \u2297 v \u2212 u \u2297 y \u2297 x \u2297 v \u2212 x \u2297 v \u2297 u \u2297 y + u \u2297 v \u2297 x \u2297 y)\n\u2032\n+ R24\n(v \u2297 x \u2297 u \u2297 y \u2212 v \u2297 u \u2297 x \u2297 y \u2212 y \u2297 x \u2297 u \u2297 v + y \u2297 u \u2297 x \u2297 v)\n\n\u2032\n+ R13\n(u \u2297 y \u2297 v \u2297 x \u2212 x \u2297 y \u2297 u \u2297 v \u2212 u \u2297 v \u2297 y \u2297 x + x \u2297 v \u2297 y \u2297 u)\n\u2032\n+ R23 (v \u2297 u \u2297 y \u2297 x \u2212 v \u2297 x \u2297 y \u2297 u \u2212 y \u2297 u \u2297 v \u2297 x + y \u2297 x \u2297 u \u2297 v).\n\nIf we take u, v \u2208 T+ and x, y \u2208 T\u2212 and use the form of R\u2032 most of these terms disappear, leaving\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212R14\nu \u2297 y \u2297 x \u2297 v + R24\ny \u2297 u \u2297 x \u2297 v + R13\nu \u2297 y \u2297 v \u2297 x \u2212 R23\ny \u2297 u \u2297 v \u2297 x.\n\n5\n\n\fIt will be sufficient to consider the case of u = e1 and v = e2 , where\nR(e1 \u2297 e2 ) = 21 h\u0304(a + b)\u03b1e3 \u2297S e4 + 12 h\u0304(b \u2212 a)\u03b2e3 \u2227 e4\n= 21 h\u0304(\u03b1(a + b) + \u03b2(b \u2212 a))e3 \u2297 e4 + 12 h\u0304(\u03b1(a + b) \u2212 \u03b2(b \u2212 a))e4 \u2297 e3 .\ne\u2032 (e1 \u2227 x \u2297 e2 \u2227 y) to\nWriting \u03c3 = 12 h\u0304(\u03b1(a + b) + \u03b2(b \u2212 a)) and \u03b4 = 21 h\u0304(\u03b1(a + b) \u2212 \u03b2(b \u2212 a)), we reduce R\n\u03c3(\u2212e3 \u2297 y \u2297 x \u2297 e4 + y \u2297 e3 \u2297 x \u2297 e4 + e3 \u2297 y \u2297 e4 \u2297 x \u2212 y \u2297 e3 \u2297 e4 \u2297 x)\n\n+ \u03b4(\u2212e4 \u2297 y \u2297 x \u2297 e3 + y \u2297 e4 \u2297 x \u2297 e3 + e4 \u2297 y \u2297 e3 \u2297 x \u2212 y \u2297 e4 \u2297 e3 \u2297 x)\n= \u03c3y \u2227 e3 \u2297 x \u2227 e4 + \u03b4y \u2227 e4 \u2297 x \u2227 e3 .\n\nThis is non-vanishing if x = e3 and y = e4 , or vice versa.

We can also check that this form of R\u2032 works on tensors of the form \u01eb+ \u2297 u0 .

Fortunately, the correction R\u2032 has a large kernel, and the\nonly difference is for multiples of \u01eb+ , which should be replaced by 21 (1 \u2212 R)\u01eb+ = \u01eb+ \u2212 \u03981 \u01eb\u2212 . Fortunately this\ndoes not cause any serious complications.\n3. Commutation relations for twistors\nWe can immediately combine Theorem 6 with Proposition 1 to give an explicit form for the twistor\ncommutation relations.\nCOROLLARY 7. The commutation relations for non-commutative twistor space can be written as\n1\n2 [he|Aui, hf |Avi]\n\n= hf \u2297 e|A(2) \u03981 \u01eb\u2212 ih\u01eb\u2217+ |u \u2297 vi + hf \u2297 e|A(2) \u01eb\u2212 ih\u01eb\u2217+ |\u03981 (u \u2297 v)i\n\n\u2212 hf \u2297 e|\u03981 \u01eb\u2212 ih\u01eb\u2217+ |Au \u2297 Avi \u2212 hf \u2297 e|\u01eb\u2212 ih\u01eb\u2217+ |\u03981 (Au \u2297 Av)i.\n\nRecalling that ker(R\u2032 ) \u2287 T\u2212 \u2297 T + T \u2297 T\u2212 , we see that the first term on the right-hand side vanishes\nwhenever u or v lies in T\u2212 . Similarly, the fact that im(R\u2032 ) \u2286 T\u2212 \u2297 T\u2212 means that the second term on the\nright vanishes for e or f in T+\u2217 . Taken together we see that [he|Aui, hf |Avi] = 0 whenever e or f \u2208 T+\u2217 and u\nor v \u2208 T\u2212 , and, in particular, elements of the form he|Aui with e \u2208 T+\u2217 and u \u2208 T\u2212 are central in the algebra.\nMore generally it is sufficient for our purposes to use only e and f in T+\u2217 , and then we derive the\ncommutation relation\n1\n2 [he|Aui, hf |Avi]\n\n= hf \u2297 e|A(2) \u03981 \u01eb\u2212 ih\u01eb\u2217+ |u \u2297 vi + hf \u2297 e|A(2) \u01eb\u2212 ih\u01eb\u2217+ |\u03981 (u \u2297 v)i.\n\nIntroducing the symplectic forms \u03c9\u00b1 (u, v) = h\u01eb\u00b1 |u \u2297 vi on T\u00b1 , and using the self-adjointness of \u03981 , we may\nrewrite this as\n1\n2 [he|Aui, hf |Avi]\n\n= hf \u2297 e|A(2) \u03981 \u01eb\u2212 i\u03c9+ (u, v) + hf \u2297 e|A(2) \u01eb\u2212 i\u03c9+ (\u0393(\u0398)u, v)\n= hf \u2297 e|A(2) [\u03c9+ (u, v)\u03981 + \u03c9+ (\u0393(\u0398)u, v)]\u01eb\u2212 i.\n6\n\n\fThe most interesting case arises for u = e1 and v = e2 when \u03c9+ (u, v) = 1 and \u03c9+ (\u0393(\u0398)u, v) = 21 h\u0304(b \u2212 a), so\nthat\n[he|Ae1 i, hf |Ae2 i] = h\u0304hf \u2297 e|A(2) ((b + a)e3 \u2297S e4 + (b \u2212 a)e3 \u2227 e4 )i\n= 2h\u0304hf \u2297 e|A(2) (be3 \u2297 e4 + ae4 \u2297 e3 )i.\n\nSetting Ajr = hej |Aer i and taking e = er and f = es , we deduce that whenever r and s are 1 or 2, the\ncommutation relation gives\n[Ar1 , As2 ] = 2h\u0304 (bAs3 Ar4 + aAs4 Ar3 ) .\nSetting zj = A1j , wj = A2j and recalling that we already know that z3 , z4 , w3 , and w4 are central, we obtain\nthe relations\n[z1 , z2 ] = 2h\u0304(a + b)z3 z4\n\n[z1 , w2 ] = 2h\u0304 (az3 w4 + bz4 w3 )\n\n[w1 , w2 ] = 2h\u0304(a + b)w3 w4 .\n\nThe first of these is essentially the relation of [4] for the twistor algebra. These provide an alternative way\nof constructing the Minkowski algebra by rewriting the matrix elements h\u01eb\u2217+ |A(2) \u03bei for \u03be \u2208 \u22272R T \u2217 in terms\nof zjk = wj zk \u2212 wk zj , we get the formulae of [4]. For example, T = h\u01eb\u2217+ |A(2) \u01eb\u2212 i = z3 w4 \u2212 w3 z4 is central to\nthe algebra.\nAppendix\nThis Appendix is devoted to a proof of Theorem 3. This is done in stages through a chain of propositions.\ne2 = 1, and that R\ne commutes with \u039b(4) = \u039b \u2297 \u039b \u2297 \u039b \u2297 \u039b. The\nWe start by rewriting the conditions that R\ne=R\ne\u22121 = [R\u22121 ]e, and the second to R\ne = \u039b(4) R\u039b\ne (4) \u22121 = [\u039b(2) R\u039b(2) \u22121 ]e. We\nfirst condition is equivalent to R\nshould like to see whether these two statements, together with the Yang-Baxter equations, are sufficient to\n\u22121\ngive R\u22121 = R = \u039b(2) R\u039b(2) .\nTo this end we ask whether two Yang-Baxter operators P and Q satisfying\nP23 P12 P34 P23 = Q23 Q12 Q34 Q23\nmust necessarily be identical, that is P = Q.\nLEMMA 8. Yang-Baxter operators P and Q satisfy P23 P12 P34 P23 = Q23 Q12 Q34 Q23 if and only if there\nexist Y and Z such that\nP23 P12 = Q23 Q12 Z23 ,\nQ23 Q12 = Z12 P23 P12 ,\nP12 P23 = Q12 Q23 Y12 ,\n\nQ12 Q23 = Y23 P12 P23 .\n\nProof: Our main tool is separation of variables, which we shall use repeatedly. We start with our assumed\nidentity, which can be rearranged as\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\nQ\u22121\n12 Q23 P23 P12 = Q34 Q23 P23 P34 .\n\nSince the left hand side is independent of 4 and the right is independent of 1, we see that each side must act\nas the identity on those factors and so can be written in the form Z23 . Rearranging this gives\nP23 P12 = Q23 Q12 Z23 ,\n\nQ34 Q23 = Z23 P34 P23 ,\n\nand by dropping the indices by 1 the second equation becomes\nQ23 Q12 = Z12 P23 P12 .\nSimilarly, since P12 and P34 commute (and similarly for Q) the assumed identity can be rearranged as\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u22121\nQ\u22121\n34 Q23 P23 P34 = Q12 Q23 P23 P12 , and setting both sides equal to Y23 gives (with an index shift)\nP12 P23 = Q12 Q23 Y12 ,\n\nQ12 Q23 = Y23 P12 P23 .\n7\n\n\fIt is clearly possible to recover the original equation by eliminating either Y or Z.\nLEMMA 9. Yang-Baxter operators P and Q satisfy P23 P12 P34 P23 = Q23 Q12 Q34 Q23 if and only if there\nexist Y , Z, C and D satisfying\nQ12 Z12 = C2 P12 ,\n\nQ12 Y12 = C1 P12 .\n\nZ12 P12 = Q12 D1 ,\n\nY12 P12 = Q12 D2 ,\n\nand P12 P23 P12 = Q12 Q23 Q12 D2 = C2\u22121 Q12 Q23 Q12 .\nProof: Using the Yang-Baxter equation for Q and the second equation of each pair in Lemma 8 we obtain\nQ12 Z12 P23 P12 = Q12 Q23 Q12 = Q23 Q12 Q23 = Q23 Y23 P12 P23 .\nNow using the Yang-Baxter equation for P , we deduce that\n\u22121\n\u22121\nQ12 Z12 P12\n= Q23 Y23 P23\n,\n\nand, since one side is the identity on the first factor and the other on the third, we deduce that both sides\nare of the form C2 for some operator C. Rearranging this gives\nQ12 Z12 = C2 P12 ,\n\nQ23 Y23 = C2 P23 ,\n\nand by lowering the indices the second equation gives\nQ12 Y12 = C1 P12 .\nSimilarly using the first equation of each pair\nQ23 Q12 Z23 P23 = P23 P12 P23 = P12 P23 P12 = Q12 Q23 Y12 P12 ,\nfrom which we see that\n\u22121\nQ\u22121\n23 Z23 P23 = Q12 Y12 P12 ,\n\nand both sides must be of the form D2 , giving\nZ12 P12 = Q12 D1 ,\n\nY12 P12 = Q12 D2 .\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the previous identities we obtain P12 P23 P12 = Q12 Q23 Q12 D2 , and similarly P12 P23 P12 = C2\u22121 Q12 Q23 Q12 . The argument easily reverses.\nThe next two results cover the cases of real interest to us. For these we limit ourselves to Yang-Baxter\noperators P and Q which are deformations of the standard flip operators, from which one readily checks that\nY , Z, C and D are all deformations of the identity operator. The main observation which we need is that\neach deformation of the identity operator, such as C, has\n\u221a a unique square root which is also a deformation\nof the identity. It is given by the binomial expansion of 1 + x with C \u2212 1 substituted for x. (In fact, since\nT is finite-dimensional, this can be rewritten as a polynomial in C).\nLEMMA 10. If Yang-Baxter operators P and Q satisfy P23 P12 P34 P23 = Q23 Q12 Q34 Q23 and Q = P \u22121 ,\nthen Q = P , that is P 2 = 1.\nProof: When Q = P \u22121 we immediately get the equations\n(P12 P23 P12 )2 = D2 = C2\u22121 ,\n8\n\n\fso that C and D are inverses. Now we also have\nD2 = (P12 P23 P12 )2 = (P12 P23 P12 )(P23 P12 P23 ) = (P12 P23 )3 ,\nand similarly\nD2 = (P23 P12 )3 .\nConsequently\nP12 D2 = P12 (P23 P12 )3 = (P12 P23 )3 P12 = D2 P12 ,\nso that D2 , and therefore C2 , commute with P12 . They similarly commute with P23 , which, by lowering the\nindices, means that D1 and C1 commute with P12 . (Since Cj clearly commutes with P12 for j > 2 this shows\nthat all the Cj and Prs commute.)\nThe remaining equations of Lemma 9 now give\n2\nQ212 D1 = Q12 Z12 P12 = C2 P12\n,\n\nand\n2\nQ212 D2 = Q12 Y12 P12 = C1 P12\n.\n4\nGiven that C and D are inverse and commute with P12 , these reduce to P12\n= C1 C2 , or P 4 = C \u2297 C. As\nnoted above C has a unique square root K deformed from the identity, and given that the undeformed value\nof P 2 is 1 we take square roots to see that P 2 = K \u2297 K.\nSince K is given by a polynomial in C it enjoys the same commutation properties as C, and in particular\nKj commutes with each of the Prs . This means that\n\nK2\u22122 = C2\u22121\n= (P12 P23 P12 )2\n2\n= P12 P23 P12\nP23 P12\n= P12 P23 K1 K2 P23 P12\n2\n= K1 K2 P12 P23\nP12\n2\n= K1 K22 K3 P12\n\n= K12 K23 K3 .\nSeparating the indices we see that K = 1, and so P 2 = K \u2297 K = 1.\nWe now look at the second case where Q12 = \u039b(2) P12 \u039b(2)\n\n\u22121\n\n. and assume that P 2 = 1 = Q2 .\n\nLEMMA 11. If Yang-Baxter operators P and Q satisfy P23 P12 P34 P23 = Q23 Q12 Q34 Q23 and P 2 = 1 = Q2\nthen P = Q.\n2\nProof: Since P and Q are involutions our earlier identity C2 P12\n= Q212 D1 reduces to C2 = D1 , so that C\nand D must both be multiples of 1, indeed the same multiple, \u03bb1. The equation\n\nQ12 Q23 Q12 D2 = C2\u22121 Q12 Q23 Q12 .\nthen shows that \u03bb2 = 1, and using the undeformed value of C = 1 we deduce that C = 1 = D. This means\nthat\nQ12 Z12 = P12 ,\nQ12 Y12 = P12 .\nZ12 P12 = Q12 ,\n\nY12 P12 = Q12 ,\n\nand\nP12 P23 P12 = Q12 Q23 Q12 .\n9\n\n\fThe first sets of equations are now consistent and can be regarded simply as definitions of Y and Z. Using\nthem in the second set we have\n\u22121\n\u22121\nY23 P23 = Q23 = Q\u22121\n12 P12 P23 P12 Q12 = Y12 P23 Y12 .\n\nWe now write Pjk = Pbjk \u03a6jk , where \u03a6jk is the flip which is the undeformed value of P . Then\nand since \u03a623 Y12 = Y13 \u03a623 , this gives\nSimilarly we obtain\nand from these we deduce that\n\nand thence that\n\nY23 Pb23 \u03a623 Y12 = Y12 Pb23 \u03a623 ,\nY23 Pb23 Y13 = Y12 Pb23\nY12 Pb12 Y13 = Y23 Pb12 ,\n\n\u22121 b \u22121 b\n\u22121 b \u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(Pb23 Y13\nP23 )(P12 Y13\nP12 ) = (Y23\nY12 )(Y12\nY23 ) = 1,\n\u22121 b\n\u22121 b\nP12 Y13 = Pb23\nP12 .\nY13 Pb23\n\n\u22121 b\nP12 , this can be rewritten as Y13 V Y13 = V , which leads to\nSetting V = Pb23\n\nY13 V 2 = Y13 V Y13 V Y13 = V 2 Y13 ,\n\nshowing that Y13 and V 2 commute. Our standard square root argument shows that Y13 commutes with V ,\n2\n= 1, and so Y13 = 1, and Q = P . In the case in hand this shows that R\nwhich in turn gives the identity Y13\ncommutes with \u039b and so with \u0398.\nReferences\n1. V. Chari & A.
