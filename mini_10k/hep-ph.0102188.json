Further it is also established that the major contribution to the hadron\nproduction in 2\u03b3 processes at high energies, comes from the hadronic structure\ntot\nof the photon [1]. Experimentally, recent data on \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\nhas shown [2,3] that the\n\u221a\ntot\ncross-section rises with s just like the \u03b3p [4,5] and pp/p\u0304p [6] case. \u03c3ee\u03b3\u03b3\nis given\nby\ntot\n\u03c3ee\u03b3\u03b3\n=\n\nZ\n\ndx1\n\nZ\n\ntot\ndx2 f\u03b31 /e (x1 ) f\u03b32 /e (x2 ) \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\n(\u015d = sx1 x2 )\n\n(1)\n\ntot\nwhere \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\nis the total hadronic cross-section \u03c3 tot (\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons) and f\u03b3i /e (xi )\n\u221a\nare the flux factors for \u03b3 in e\u2212 /e+ . Hence it is clear that the s\u03b3\u03b3 dependence\n\u221a\ntot\ntot\nof \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\ncontrols the rate of the rise of \u03c3ee2\u03b3\nwith se+ e\u2212 and this knowledge is\nnecessary to estimate the hadronic backgrounds due to the 2\u03b3 processes at the\nfuture linear colliders. It has been pointed out that these can threaten to spoil\nthe clean environment of an LC [7,8]; particularly at high energy e+ e\u2212 colliders\nlike CLIC as well as the \u03b3\u03b3 colliders [9] that are being discussed. Apart from\ntot\nthis pragmatic need for a good model to extrapolate the \u03c32\u03b3\nat high energies, the\n2\u03b3 system also provides an additional theoretical laboratory to test our models of\n\n\ftot\ncalculating \u03c3AB\n. Understanding the observed rise with energy of all the hadronic\ncross-sections in a QCD based picture is a theoretical challenge. Since the crosssections of photon induced processes [10,9] show some special features, such studies\nincrease our understanding of the photon as well. The dramatic improvement in\ntot\nthe state of the data on \u03c32\u03b3\n[2,3] from the study of 2\u03b3 processes at LEP has already\nhelped provide discrimination among predictions of theoretical models [11\u201313].\n\nTHEORETICAL MODELS\ntot\nThere exist two types of theoretical models [14] for calculation of \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\n; what\nwe can call loosely as (i) 'Photon is like a proton' models [15\u201319] and (ii) QCD\nbased models [20\u201323]. In the first class of models, the energy dependence of the\n\u03b3\u03b3 cross-sections is essentially similar to that for pp/p\u0304p. In Ref. [15] the total \u03b3\u03b3\ncross-section is assumed to be described in the form\ntot\n= Y\u03b3\u03b3 s\u2212\u03b7 + X\u03b3\u03b3 s\u01eb\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\n\n(2)\n\nThe powers \u03b7 and \u01eb are assumed to be universal and hence the same as those\nfor pp/p\u0304p; \u01eb=0.079 and \u03b7=0.467. X\u03b3\u03b3 is determined by assuming factorization,\n2\ni.e. X\u03b3\u03b3 Xpp = X\u03b3p\nand similarly for Y\u03b3\u03b3 . The values X\u03b3p , Xpp are taken from fits\nto (pp) p\u0304p and \u03b3p data in a form similar to that given by equation (2). Ref. [16]\nhas a more elaborate treatment, but their final predictions for \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 follow a pattern\nsimilar to equation (2). BSW [17] predictions just assume \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 = A \u03c3pp and try\nto estimate A. Aspen model [18] and GLMN model [19] actually are a mixture of\nQCD based models, to be described later, and treating the photon like a proton.\nIt is assumed in these models that the rise of total \u03b3\u03b3 cross-section is caused by\nincreased number of parton collisions in photons. However, all the parameters of\nthe model for photons are obtained from those for protons using the ideas of quark\n\u221a\nmodel. Thus, their predictions of s\u03b3\u03b3 dependence of \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 are similar to those of\nRefs. [15,16].\nThe models which are based on QCD use the information on the photon structure\nobtained experimentally as crucial inputs. In BKKS model [20] \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 is related to\nF2\u03b3 . In the eikonalised minijet model [21], the total eikonalized cross-section for\ntot\n\u03c3AB\n(A+B \u2192 hadrons) is written as\ntot\n\u03c3AB\n\n=\n\nhad\n2PAB\n\nZ\n\nd2~b[1 \u2212 e\u03c7I cos\u03c7AB\nR ]\nAB\n\n(3)\n\nAB\nwhere \u03c7AB\ngiven\nR can be taken to be \u2248 0 and the imaginary part of the eikonal, \u03c7I\nby\nsof t\n(s) +\n2\u03c7AB\n= AAB (b)[\u03c3AB\nI\n\n1\nhad\nPAB\n\njet\n(s, pmin\n\u03c3AB\nT )]\n\n(4)\n\nsof t\nIn equation (4) above, \u03c3AB\n(s) is the nonperturbative, soft cross-section of hadronic\nsize which is fitted, AAB (b) is the overlap function of the partons in the two hadrons\n\n\fhad\nA and B in the transverse space, PAB\nis the product of the probabilities that the\nhad\nprojectiles A and B hadronize, PA/B being unity if either A or B is a hadron and\njet\nwhich can be\nis \u223c O(\u03b1em ) for a photon. The QCD input is in the quantity \u03c3AB\nsymbolically written as\njet\n(pmin\n\u03c3AB\nT , s) \u2261\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ns/2\n\nPTmin\n\nd\u03c3\n(A + B \u2192 j1 + j2 )\ndpT\n\nX Z\n\ns/2\n\nmin\nl,m,p,q pT\n\nZ\n\ndx1\n\nZ\n\ndx2 fl/A (x1 ) fm/B (x2 )\n\n(5)\nd\u03c3\u0302\n(l + m \u2192 p + q)\ndpT\n\nfl/A (x1 ), fm/B (x2 ), d\u03c3\u0302/dpT are the QCD inputs. The very steep rise of \u03c3 jet wih s\nis tempered by the eikonal function, such that unitarity bound is satisfied. The\nmodelling aspect is in the choice of P had and ansatz for AAB (b). We take\nhad\nP\u03b3p\n= P\u03b3had \u2261 P had =\n\nX\n\n4\u03c0\u03b1\n1\n\u2243\n2\n240\nV =\u03c1,\u03c9,\u03c6 fV\n\n(6)\n\nhad\nand P\u03b3\u03b3\n= (P\u03b3had )2 . AAB (b) is normally taken to be Fourier Transform (F.T.) of\nthe product of the e.m. form factors of the colliding hadrons. For a photon, instead\nof modelling it through the F.T. of the pion form factor, as done previously [24], we\ntake it to be the F.T. of the internal kT distribution of the partons in the photon\nas measured by ZEUS [25]. In our model [21,22] we determined the soft parameter\nfor \u03b3\u03b3 through a Quark Model ansatz and used\n\nA\n2 sof t 2\nB\nsof t\n= [\u03c30 + \u221a + ]\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\n= \u03c3\u03b3p\n3\n3\ns\ns\n\n(7)\n\nwhere A and B are fitted to the \u03b3p data.\nIn Aspen model [18] the formulation is the same as in equation (3). However,\nAB\n\u03c7I is completely decided by using that for protons and quark model ideas. Other\nmodel which uses the EMM formulation [23] actually tries to calculate AAB (b) from\nQCD resummation and is even more close to QCD than the formulation discussed\nearlier [21,22].\n\nPREDICTIONS OF THE MODELS\nLeft panel of Fig. 1 shows the \u03b3p data [4,5,26,27] along with a band of EMM\nmodel predictions [21,22,13].

The right panel\nin Fig. 1 shows the prediction along with the latest compilation of the 2\u03b3 data on\ntot\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\n[2,3]. One sees from the figure that the values of the parameters which give a\ngood fit to the \u03b3\u03b3 data actually predict a normalisation for \u03b3p data higher by 10%.\nThe situation should clarify once the newer photoproduction data from HERA firm\nup. Of course, variations of the parameters within the limits allowed by the \u03b3p data\ngive a band of predictions for the EMM model for \u03b3\u03b3 case. This band of predictions\nis shown in Fig. 2 where alongwith the EMM model predictions [21,12,22,13] the\npredictions of various other models [15,16,19,17,18,20] are shown too. We observe\ntot\nthat in general the data on \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\nseem to rise faster than the predictions of most of\nthe 'photon like\n\u221a a proton' models. The data certainly seems to rise faster than the\n\u03c3pp /\u03c3p\u0304p with s. Predictions of different QCD based models [20,22] reproduce the\ndata to a similar degree of satisfaction 2 . The question to ask now is how can the\nfuture LC help us distinguish between the various models in the e+ e\u2212 mode and in\nthe Compton mode.\n\nDISCRIMINATION BETWEEN THEORETICAL\nMODELS AT FUTURE COLLIDERS\nIn view of the inherent experimental uncertainties in unfolding \u03b3\u03b3 cross-sections\ntot\ntot\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\nfrom the measured hadronic cross-sections in e+ e\u2212 collisions \u03c3ee\u03b3\u03b3\n, of course\n2)\n\nBKKS predictions have a lattitude in overall normalisation which can bring these predictions\n\u221a\ndown at lower s\u03b3\u03b3\n\n\f1000\nRegge/Pomeron, SaS\nGLMN\nBSW\nAspen\n\n800\n\nBKKS\nEMM\n\n\u03c3tot(nb)\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\nTPC\nDesy 1984\nDESY 86\nLEP2-OPAL 189 GeV\n\nLEP2-L3 189 GeV and\n192-202 GeV\n1\n\n10\n\n\u221as (GeV)\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nFIGURE 2.

This clearly shows that\n+ \u2212\na Compton collider with a parent e e collider of s = 500 GeV, can certainly\ndistinguish between the different theoretical models and provide an opportunity to\nlearn about the interactions of high energy photons.\nHowever, the discriminatory power is not lost even if one considers only the e+ e\u2212\ntot\ntot\noption. This can be seen by calculating \u03c3ee\u03b3\u03b3\n. Recall that \u03c3ee\u03b3\u03b3\nis given by equation\n\nTABLE 1. Predictions for different 'proton-like' models.

The photon spectra f\u03b3/e (x) receive contributions from both bremstrahlung\n(Weiz\u00e4cker-Williams - WW) photons and beamstrahlung. The WW spectra with\nwhich one folds \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 have to take into account the (anti) tagging conditions at e+ e\u2212\ncolliders as well as inclusion of the effect of virtuality of tageed photon on the\ntot\ntot\ncross-section [31]. Major uncertainties in the unfolding of \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\nfrom \u03c3ee\u03b3\u03b3\ncome\nfrom modelling the behaviour of the hadronic system that is boosted in the beam\ndirection and lost to the detectors. Hence one way of making comparisons with data\ntot\nfree of this modelling is to make predictions for \u03c3ee2\u03b3\nby restricting the integration\n\u221a\nregion in equation (1) to regions of s\u03b3\u03b3 where these uncertainties are least.

The lower edge corresponds\nto models which treat 'photon like a proton' and the upper edge to the QCD based\nmodels. The upper band corresponds to the predictions when no (anti) tagging\nrequirement has been imposed on the \u03b3 spectra. The lower band represents the more\nrealistic predictions by assuming for the NLC, \u03b8tag = 0.025 rad and Eemin = 0.20\n\n\f\u221a\nEbeam . This causes \u223c 40% reduction in the rates for ( s\u03b3\u03b3 )min = 9 GeV. Note that,\ntot\nthe differences in \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\nof factor \u223c 2-3 for different models is reduced to \u223c 30% for\nhad\n\u03c3ee\u03b3\u03b3 . However, the demands on precision required to discriminate between different\ntheoretical models are still very much within the reach of the LC measurements\neven for the e+ e\u2212 mode. In the calculation I present here only the contribution of\nbremsstrahlung photons is included. The inclusion of the beamstrahlung photons\nmight increase the discriminatory power, but that needs to be investigated.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\nWe can summarise our discussions as follows:\n1. Models which treat photon like a proton tend to predict a rise of cross-sections\ntot\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\nwith energy slower than shown by \u03b3\u03b3 data. QCD based models predict a\nfaster rise.\n2. \u03b3p data seems also to show tendency of needing a value of \u01eb (\u223c s\u01eb ) higher than\nthat for pp/p\u0304p.\n3. Extraction of \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 (\u03c3\u03b3p ) from data is no mean task.\n4. Accurate measurements of \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 at a \u03b3\u03b3 collider will be capable of distinguishing\nbetween these different models. A precision of \u223c 20% is required for that.\n5. When\nfolded with bremstrahlung spectra the difference of 200 - 300 % at high\n\u221a\ntot\ns in \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\nin different models reduces to 30%.\n6. The issue needs to be investigated for high energy e+ e\u2212 colliders including the\neffects of beamstrahlung.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to thank the organisers for an excellent meeting.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
