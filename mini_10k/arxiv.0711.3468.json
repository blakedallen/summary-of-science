Additionally, we show that the same is true\nfor a slightly wider class of simplicial complexes, the so-called generalized Phan geometries of type An . These generalized Phan geometries occur as relative links of the\nfiltration studied in [14], whose sphericity implies topological finiteness properties of\nsuitable arithmetic groups and allows for a revision of Phan's group-theoretical local\nrecognition [21], [22] of suitable finite groups of Lie type with simply laced diagrams.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we prove the following result.\nMain Theorem\nLet K be an arbitrary field, let \u03c3 be an automorphism of K of order one or two and\n\u2217\n\nThe first author was a Collaborateur Scientifique F.R.S.-FNRS during the time when most of the work\nfor this article was done.\n\u2020\nThe second author gratefully acknowledges a Heisenberg fellowship of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.\n\n1\n\n\flet V be an (n + 1)-dimensional vector space over K endowed with a non-degenerate \u03c3hermitian form h. Moreover, let \u0393 be the simplicial complex whose vertices are the nontrivial subspaces which are non-degenerate with respect to h and where incidence is defined\n\u221a\nby inclusion. If K is a finite field of order q, assume 2n < q in case \u03c3 = id and 2n\u22121 ( q +\n1) < q in case \u03c3 6= id.\nThen \u0393 is Cohen-Macaulay. In particular, |\u0393| is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of\n(n \u2212 1)-spheres.\n\nFor K = Fq2 , q \u2265 4, n \u2265 3, and h hermitian, the above simplicial complex \u0393 is known\nto be simply connected by [6], [13], [10]. Using standard arguments from geometric group\ntheory this implies Phan's theorem [21], which states that the group SUn+1 (q 2 ) equals the\nuniversal enveloping group of the amalgam of its fundamental subgroups of rank one and\ntwo. Because of this prominent role in the revision of Phan's results, the geometry of\nnon-degenerate subspaces described above is called the Phan geometry associated to the\npair (V, h).\nIn fact, there is a canonical way to associate a Phan geometry to any flip of a spherical\nbuilding (see [8]). A flip is an involutory automorphism of the spherical building that acts\nvia conjugation with the longest word of the Weyl group on the Weyl distance and maps\nsome chamber to an opposite chamber. In other words, a flip is an involutory isometry of\nthe associated spherical twin building (see [26]) such that there exists a chamber that is\nopposite its image under that involution. It was observed in [14] that a Phan geometry\ninduced by a flip shares a lot of properties with the geometry far away from a chamber. In\na sense, our work underlines this observation, because we successfully adapted the strategy\nof proof of the analogue of the Main Theorem for the far-away geometries in An buildings\nobtained by Abels and Abramenko in [2] (see also [3]) to the situation of Phan geometries.\nThe sphericity of the far-away geometries turns out to be important in the work by\nAbels and Abramenko on topological finiteness properties of the group SLn+1 (Fq [t]). The\nmain motivation for our investigations was to obtain a similar tool for proving topological\nfiniteness properties for centralizers of flips in split Kac-Moody groups over finite fields,\nsuch as for the group\nSUn+1 (Fq2 [t, t\u22121 ], \u03b8) = {A \u2208 SLn+1 (Fq2 [t, t\u22121 ]) | (A\u22121 )\u03b8 = AT }\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the involution of the field Fq2 (t) mapping t to t\u22121 and acting as the Frobenius\ninvolution on Fq2 . However, it turned out that the statement of the Main Theorem is\nnot sufficient for this purpose. The reason is that the relative links in the filtration of\n[14] are slightly more general than the Phan geometries. This lead us to the definition\nof generalized Phan geometries, see Section 3, which is quite technical. Fortunately, while\nmodifying an earlier version of the proof of the Main Theorem in order to make it work\nfor the generalized Phan geometries, we observed that the arguments became much more\nnatural in this wider context and some technicalities just disappeared. In fact, the class of\ngeneralized Phan geometries contains both the class of Phan geometries and the class of\ngeometries far from a chamber.\nAs we have already indicated, the result of the present paper is meant to provide a tool\nto determine the finiteness lengths of unitary forms of split Kac-Moody groups over finite\n2\n\n\ffields along the lines of [3]. Apart from this application we would like to mention that the\ncases of small dimension n \u2208 {2, 3} of our result are precisely what is needed in the revision\nof Phan's result for the finite Chevalley groups with simply laced diagram (see [17]; see\n[22] for Phan's original result). Our proof provides a more systematic approach than the\none given in [17], which is based on a case by case distinction. However, the proof in [17]\ncovers q = 4, which the proof presented in this paper does not.\nThe methods needed in order to obtain the Main Theorem are quite elementary and\nconsist of linear algebra and basic homology theory. Our approach is based on a combination of the strategy of the sphericity proof for far-away geometries given in [3] and several\ntechniques used in the revision of Phan's presentation [8]. The necessary material from\ntopology is discussed in Section 2, while in Section 3 we study some examples of generalized Phan geometries of type An . Section 4 concentrates on proving that generalized Phan\ngeometries of type An are spherical over sufficiently large fields. This goal is achieved in\nTheorem 4.6 and its Corollary 4.7. The Main Theorem stated above is just a special case.\nFinally, in Section 5 we outline in more detail the two applications of this sphericity result\nto group theory mentioned above. While Sections 2, 3 and 4 are largely self-contained, the\ncharacter of Section 5 is that of a survey. The final section is intended to serve as a motivation for our interest in generalized Phan geometries of type An , so that our arguments\ngiven there should only be considered as sketches. The content of Section 5 is based on\nFact 5.1, which has already been proved in special situations in the literature, cf. [11]. We\nintend to a give a general building-theoretic proof in a separate publication.\nAcknowledgement: The research resulting in this paper has been initiated during an\nRiP stay at Oberwolfach in summer 2006.

The join of two simplicial complexes\nK1 = (V1 , S1 ) and K2 = (V2 , S2 ), in symbols K1 \u2217 K2 , equals the simplicial complex with\n3\n\n\fvertex set equal to the disjoint union V1 \u2294 V2 and set of simplices equal to {v \u222a w \u2208 V1 \u2294 V2 |\nv \u2208 S1 , w \u2208 S2 }.\nFurthermore, let |K|, called realization of K, be the set of all functions \u03b1 from the set of\nvertices of K to thePreal unit interval I such that, for any \u03b1, the set {v \u2208 K | \u03b1(v) 6= 0} is a\nsimplex of K, and v\u2208K \u03b1(v) = 1, i.e., |K| is obtained from K via barycentric coordinates.\nIn this article we consider the weak (coherent) topology on |K|, cf. [24, 3.1.14]. By [24,\n7.6.4] the realization |K| of a simplicial complex K is a CW complex.\n\nDefinition 2.2 (Realization) A poset X gives rise to a simplicial complex with the nonempty finite chains of X as simplices. Endowed with the weak topology, this simplicial\ncomplex is called the realization of X and denoted by |X|.\nIn analogy to simplicial complexes, the join of two posets X and Y , also denoted by\nX \u2217 Y , is the disjoint union X \u2294 Y endowed with the partial order which agrees with the\ngiven partial orders on X and on Y and which is such that any element of X is less than\nany element of Y .\nDefinition 2.3 (Closed simplex, open simplex, star, link) Let K be a simplicial complex and let s be a simplex of K. The closed simplex |s| equals {\u03b1 \u2208 |K| | \u03b1(v) 6=\n0 =\u21d2 v \u2208 s}. Hence, if s is a q-simplex, then\nP |s| is naturally homeomorphic to the\nq+1\nstandard simplex {x \u2208 R\n| 0 \u2264 xi \u2264 1, xi = 1}. The open simplex hsi equals\n{\u03b1 \u2208 |K| | \u03b1(v) 6= 0 \u21d0\u21d2 v \u2208 s}. The open simplex hsi is open in |s|, but not necessarily\nin |K|.\nFor a vertex v \u2208 K, the (open) star StK (v) equals {\u03b1 \u2208 |K| | \u03b1(v) 6= 0}. The link of x\nis defined as LkK (x) := StK (x)\\StK (x).\nS\nWe have StK (x) = {hsi | x is vertex of s}, cf. [24, 3.1.24].\nDefinition 2.4 (Wedge sum) Let X and Y be pointed spaces, i.e., topological spaces\nwith distinguished base points x0 and y0 . Then the wedge sum X \u2228 Y of X and Y is the\nquotient of the disjoint union X \u2294 Y by the identification x0 \u223c y0 , i.e.,\nX \u2228 Y := (X \u2294 Y )/{x0 \u223c y0 }.\nIn general, if (Xi )i\u2208I is a family of pointed spaces with base points (xi )i\u2208I and if x is a\none-point space, then the wedge sum of this family is given by\nG\n_\nXi :=\nXi /{xi \u223c x}.\ni\u2208I\n\ni\u2208I\n\nThe wedge sum of a family of spheres each of which is homeomorphic to the standard\nsphere Sn = {x \u2208 Rn+1 | kxk = 1} is called a wedge of spheres or, if one wants to specify\nthe dimension, a wedge of n-spheres.\nThe following topological observations are crucial for the proof of our main result. A\nCW complex of dimension at most m is called m-spherical if it has the homotopy type of\na wedge m-spheres.\n4\n\n\fLemma 2.5\nA connected 1-dimensional CW complex X has the homotopy type of a wedge of 1-spheres.\nProof: Let T \u2286 X be a maximal subtree. Then T is contractible and contains all\nvertices (see [24, Lemmas 3.7.1 and 3.7.2]), whence by the homotopy extension property\nX is homotopy equivalent to X/T (see [24, Corollary 3.2.5]). This quotient is a connected\n1-dimensional complex with exactly one vertex, i.e. a wedge of 1-spheres.\n\u2737\nLemma 2.6\nS\nLet X be a CW complex of dimension at most m which is a union X = B \u222a i Ai of\nsubcomplexes B, Ai , where i ranges over some (possibly infinite) index set I. Suppose that\nB is m-spherical, that the Ai are contractible, that Ai \u2229 Aj \u2286 B for i 6= j, and that Ai \u2229 B\nis m \u2212 1-spherical, for every i. Then X is m-spherical.\nProof: If X is 1-dimensional, the result is true by Lemma 2.5.\nAssume now that m \u2265 2. Let Y = B \u222a Ai . The Mayer-Vietoris sequence in reduced\nhomology is\n0 \u2192 H\u0303m (B) \u2295 H\u0303m (Ai ) \u2192 H\u0303m (Y ) \u2192 H\u0303m\u22121 (B \u2229 Ai ) \u2192 0\nso Y has the same homology as a wedge of m-spheres. By Van Kampen's Theorem, B \u2229 Ai\nis 1-connected. W\nIt follows from Hurewicz' Theorem [24, 7.5.4] that \u03c0\u2217 (Y ) \u223c\n= H\u2217 (Y ) for\nm\n\u2217 \u2264 m. Let f : J S \u2192 Y be a map sending each sphere summand to a free generator\nof \u03c0m (Y ). Then f is a homology equivalence and therefore a homotopy equivalence [24,\n7.5.9, 7.6.24]. It follows by induction that B \u222a Ai1 \u222a * * * \u222a Air has the homotopy type of a\nwedge of m-spheres. Since every compact set C \u2286 X is contained in such a finite union,\nX is m \u2212 1-connected and has the same homology asWa wedge of m-spheres. By the same\nargument as before, we find a homotopy equivalence K S m \u2192 X.\n\u2737\n\nWe close this section by specifying the characterizing property of Cohen-Macaulayness\nthat we are going to use in this article; cf. [23, Section 8].\n\nDefinition 2.7 (Cohen-Macaulay) A d-dimensional simplicial complex K is called CohenMacaulay, if it is d-spherical, and if in addition the link of each p-simplex is (d \u2212 p \u2212 1)spherical.\n\n3\n\nGeneralized Phan geometries of type An\n\nDefinition 3.1 Let V be a vector space. Two subspaces A and B of V are opposite when\nV = A \u2295 B. A flag is a chain of incident subspaces. A subspace A is transversal or in\ngeneral position to a flag F , denoted by A \u22d4V F , if for any subspace B of F we have\nA \u2229 B = {0} or V = A + B.\nNotice that A \u22d4V F if and only if there is a subspace C of V incident with F such that A\nand C are opposite.\n5\n\n\fDefinition 3.2 Let K be a field, let \u03c3 be an automorphism of K of order one or two, let V\nbe an (n + 1)-dimensional K-vector space, let 0 \u2264 t \u2264 n, let F = {Vi | 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t + 1} with\n0 = V0 V1 * * * Vt Vt+1 = V be a flag of subspaces of V , and let \u03c9i : Vi+1 \u00d7Vi+1 \u2192 K,\n0 \u2264 i \u2264 t, be \u03c3-hermitian forms which admit non-isotropic vectors and satisfy\nRad (\u03c9i ) = Vi .\nThe generalized Phan geometry of type An of V with respect to F and (\u03c9i )0\u2264i\u2264t consists\nof all proper non-trivial vector subspaces U of V transversal to F with U \u2229 VkU +1 nondegenerate with respect to \u03c9kU where kU = min{i \u2208 {0, . . . , t} | U \u2229 Vi+1 6= {0}}.\nExample 3.3 For t = 0 the generalized Phan geometry on V equals the complex of proper\nnon-trivial non-degenerate subspaces of V with respect to a non-degenerate \u03c3-hermitian\nform. For \u03c3 of order one and the field K of characteristic distinct from two, this complex\nis simply connected by [4], [5]. For K = Fq2 and \u03c3 the Frobenius involution, this complex\nhas been studied in [6], [13] and in [10] in order to re-prove Phan's characterization [21] of\nthe group SUn+1 (q 2 ) via combinatorial topology.\nExample 3.4 For t = n, the generalized Phan geometry on V equals the geometry opposite a chamber in a building of type An (whose sphericity has been established in [2],\nsee also [3]). Indeed, the flag F is a chamber and each \u03c9i has rank one with radical Vi .\nTherefore any vector v \u2208 Vi+1 \\Vi is non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9i , so that any subspace U of V with U \u2295 Vi = V intersects Vi+1 in a non-degenerate (with respect to \u03c9i )\none-dimensional subspace.\nJust like the geometries opposite a chamber occur as relative links in filtrations used\nto establish finiteness properties of certain arithmetic groups (cf. [1], [3]), so do the generalized Phan geometries. The following series of examples illustrates how generalized Phan\ngeometries occur as relative links.\nExample 3.5 Let V be a vector space and consider a generalized Phan geometry on V\nwith t = 0, i.e., the geometry of non-degenerate subspaces of V with respect to a form\n\u03c90 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 K. Let H be a hyperplane of V with radical R of dimension zero or one.\nThen the intersection of the link of H (in the complex of proper non-trivial subspaces of\nV ) with the subcomplex of proper non-trivial \u03c90 -non-degenerate subspaces of V , equals\nall proper non-trivial subspaces of H which are non-degenerate with respect to \u03c90|H\u00d7H .\nEach of these subspaces is transversal to the flag {{0}, R, H}, so that this relative link is\na generalized Phan geometry. (Notice that the form on R does not play any role for this\ngeneralized Phan geometry.)\nIn Lemma 4.2 we prove that the relative link of an arbitrary element of a generalized\nPhan geometry is isomorphic to a generalized Phan geometry or the direct sum (i.e., join)\nof two generalized Phan geometries.\n\n6\n\n\fExample 3.6 Let B be a building of type An , let R be a residue of B, and let \u03c0 be a\npolarity of B. Using the notation from [14], the chamber system A\u03c0 (R) consists of all those\nchambers of R with maximal possible distance (i.e., minimal possible codistance) from their\nimage under \u03c0. This chamber system plays a crucial role in the filtration studied in [14]\nand yields a direct sum of generalized Phan geometries, cf. Fact 5.1. When dealing with\npolarities of projective spaces (buildings of type An ), this distance of a chamber c from its\nimage under \u03c0 can be measured by the grade of nondegeneracy of the elements contained\nin the chamber c.\nFor instance, let V be a six-dimensional vector space (which corresponds to a building of\ntype A5 ) endowed with a non-degenerate unitary form h (which corresponds to a polarity\n\u03c0). Consider the residue of V with respect to the flag consisting of an h-singular onedimensional subspace p and an incident five-dimensional subspace H with one-dimensional\nh-radical x. Fixing a four-dimensional complement C of p not containing x, we can identify\nthe set of chambers of V containing p and H with the set of chambers of C by taking the\nintersection. The set of chambers in the residue of (p, H) which are mapped by \u03c0 to\na chamber as far away as possible, correspond in C to maximal flags of subspaces of the\nfollowing types: (i) one-dimensional subspaces of C opposite to p\u22a5 \u2229C, (ii) two-dimensional\nsubspaces of C transversal to p\u22a5 \u2229 C which intersect p\u22a5 \u2229 C in an h-non-degenerate onedimensional subspace, and (iii) three-dimensional subspaces of C transversal to p\u22a5 \u2229 C\nwhich intersect p\u22a5 \u2229 C in an h-non-degenerate two-dimensional subspace. This description\nshows that this residue is isomorphic to a generalized Phan geometry of C with respect to\nthe flag {{0}, C \u2229 p\u22a5 , C} and the form h|(C\u2229p\u22a5 )\u00d7(C\u2229p\u22a5 ) and an arbitrary sesquilinear form\nf : C \u00d7 C \u2192 K of rank one with radical C \u2229 p\u22a5 .\n\n4\n\nSphericity of generalized Phan geometries\n\nIn this section we prove the Main Theorem from the introduction in the guise of Theorem\n4.6 and Corollary 4.7. We achieve this by using a filtration method similar to the one\ndescribed in [2, Theorem 1.1], [3, Chapter II, Proposition 12]. Our incarnation of that\nstrategy, as described in the proof of Theorem 4.6 below, requires that there is a canonical\nway to extend each form \u03c9i of a generalized Phan geometry to the whole ambient vector\nspace. The following lemma takes care of this issue.\nLemma 4.1\nLet \u0393 be a generalized Phan geometry of V with respect to a flag F = {Vi | 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t + 1}\nwith forms (\u03c9i )0\u2264i\u2264t . Let p be a one-dimensional space in V that is \u03c9t -non-degenerate and\nsatisfies p \u2229 Vt = {0}. Then, for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t, there exist \u03c3-hermitian forms \u03c9 i : V \u00d7 V \u2192 K\nwith the properties\n\u2022 \u03c9 i |Vi+1 \u00d7Vi+1 = \u03c9i ,\n\u2022 Rad (\u03c9 i ) = Rad (\u03c9i ) = Vi ,\n\u2022 p is \u03c9 i -non-degenerate (0 \u2264 i \u2264 t) and satisfies p\u22a5\u03c9i = p\u22a5\u03c9j for all 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 t.\n7\n\n\fProof: Let p be a \u03c9t -non-degenerate one-dimensional subspace of V , which necessarily\nsatisfies p \u2229 Vt = {0}. Then\nV\n\n= C1 \u2295 C2 \u2295 C3 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Ct \u2295 Ct+1 \u2295 p\n\u223c\n= V1 \u2295 (V2 /V1 ) \u2295 (V3 /V2 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 (Vt /Vt\u22121 ) \u2295 (p\u22a5\u03c9t /Vt ) \u2295 p,\n\nwhere Ci is a complement of Vi\u22121 in Vi for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t and Ct+1 is a complement of Vt in\np\u22a5\u03c9t .

On one hand it allows us to make use\nof an induction on the dimension when studying the homotopy type of a generalized Phan\ngeometry in Theorem 4.6. On the other hand it provides us with the local information required for the Cohen-Macaulayness of a generalized Phan geometry addressed in Corollary\n4.7.\nLemma 4.2\nLet \u0393 be a generalized Phan geometry of V with respect to a flag F = {Vi | 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t + 1}\nwith forms (\u03c9i )0\u2264i\u2264t , and let U \u2208 \u0393 be an element of \u0393.\nThen the geometries \u0393<U := {x \u2208 \u0393 | x ( U} and \u0393>U := {x \u2208 \u0393 | x ) U} are\nisomorphic to generalized Phan geometries of U, respectively, V /U. In particular, the link\nof U in |\u0393| is isomorphic to the join |\u0393<U \u2217 \u0393>U | of a generalized Phan geometry of U and\nof a generalized Phan geometry of V /U.\nProof: The first claim is immediate: The geometry \u0393<U is isomorphic to the generalized\nPhan geometry of \u0001U with respect to the flag {Vi \u2229 U | kU \u2264 i \u2264 t + 1} and forms\n\u03c9i|(U \u2229Vi+1 )\u00d7(U \u2229Vi+1 ) k \u2264i\u2264t where kU = min{i \u2208 {0, . . . , t} | U \u2229 Vi+1 6= {0}}.\nU\n\nIn order to establish the isomorphism type of \u0393>U , consider the vector space V = V /U.\nDefine F := {Vi + U | 0 \u2264 i \u2264 kU + 1}. This is a flag of V with V0 + U = 0 + U and\nVkU +1 + U = V , so that any element of V can be written as x + U with x \u2208 VkU +1 . In\n\u22a5\nfact, every element of V can be uniquely written as x + U with x \u2208 (U \u2229 VkU +1 ) \u03c9kU =: W .\nNotice that VkU is contained in W , and therefore so are all subspaces Vi for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 kU . In\nthis specified interval for i define \u03c3-hermitian forms\n\u03c9 i : (Vi+1 + U) \u00d7 (Vi+1 + U) \u2192 K : (x + U, y + U) 7\u2192 \u03c9 i (x + U, y + U) := \u03c9i (x, y)\nwhere x, y \u2208 Vi+1 \u2229 W . With this definition, certainly Rad (\u03c9 i ) = Vi + U for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 kU ,\nso that we have defined a generalized Phan geometry in V .\n8\n\n\fIt remains to prove that this generalized Phan geometry is isomorphic to \u0393>U . Let S be a\nsubspace of V containing U and let kS = min{i \u2208 {0, . . . , t} | S \u2229 Vi+1 6= {0}} be defined as\nabove. Then it is easily seen that we have S \u22d4V F if and only if (S + U) \u22d4V F . Moreover,\nkS = min{i \u2208 {0, . . . , kU } | (S + U) \u2229 (Vi+1 + U) 6= U}. Furthermore, the intersection\nS \u2229 VkS +1 is \u03c9kS -non-degenerate if and only if the intersection S \u2229 VkS +1 \u2229 W is \u03c9kS -nondegenerate. Indeed, in case kS < kU , there is nothing to show, because VkS +1 \u2229 W = VkS +1 ,\nwhile in case kS = kU the claim follows from the observation that U \u2229 VkU +1 is \u03c9kU -nondegenerate and W is \u03c9kU -orthogonal to U \u2229 VkU +1 . The lemma now follows from the fact\nthat, for x \u2208 S \u2229 VkS +1 \u2229 W , by definition, x is \u03c9kS -orthogonal to y \u2208 S \u2229 VkS +1 \u2229 W if and\n\u2737\nonly if x + U is \u03c9 kS -orthogonal to y + U.\nThe following is an immediate consequence of Lemma 4.2.\nLemma 4.3\nT\nLet (\u0393j )j be a finite family of m generalized Phan geometries of V and let U \u2208 j \u0393j .\nT\nT\nT\nT\nThen the geometries ( j \u0393j )<U := {x \u2208 j \u0393j | x ( U} and ( j \u0393j )>U := {x \u2208 j \u0393j |\nT\nT >U\nx ) U} are isomorphic to intersections j \u0393<U\nofT\nm generalized Phan\nj , respectively,\nj \u0393j\ngeometries of U, respectively, V /U. In particular, the link of U in | j \u0393j | is isomorphic\nT\nT >U\nto the join |( j \u0393<U\n\u0393j )| of the intersection of m generalized Phan geometries of U\nj )\u2217(\nand of the intersection of m generalized Phan geometries of V /U.\nT\nT\nT\nT\nand ( j \u0393j )>U = j \u0393>U\nProof: It is obvious that ( j \u0393j )<U = j \u0393<U\nj . Hence all claims\nj\nfollows from Lemma 4.2.\n\u2737\nNow we have almost everything in place in order to prove the Main Theorem. It\nremains to provide the following geometric existence results which help us to determine\nthe homotopy type of a generalized Phan geometry of a two-dimensional vector space. This\ntwo-dimensional case will serve as the basis of the induction on the dimension used in the\nproof of Theorem 4.6 below.\nLemma 4.4\nLet m \u2208 N, let F \u2264 K be fields, let V be a vector space of dimension at least two over F,\nand for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m let \u03c6i : V \u00d7 V \u2192 K be an F-bilinear map which admits a non-isotropic\nvector. If 2m < |F|, then there exist two F-linearly independent vectors of V which are\nnon-isotropic with respect to all maps \u03c6i .\nProof: We proceed by induction on the number of maps. For m = 0 there is nothing\nto prove. Assuming the theorem is true for m maps, let v be a vector which is nonisotropic with respect to m maps and let w be a vector that is non-isotropic with respect\nto a (m + 1)st map. Considering linear combinations of v and w we obtain finitely many\nquadratic equations in K whose F-rational zeros have to be avoided in order to find a\nvector which is non-isotropic with respect to all m + 1 forms. Since a two-dimensional\nF-vector space contains |F| + 1 one-dimensional subspaces, two vectors of V satisfying the\nconclusion of the lemma exist, if 2(m + 1) < |F|.\n\u2737\n9\n\n\fThe same proof works in the setting of hermitian forms of vector spaces over a finite\n\u221a\nfield of square order q. The only difference is that there are at most q + 1 isotropic\none-dimensional subspaces per form in a two-dimensional Fq -vector space instead of two.\nLemma 4.5\nLet V be a vector space of dimension at least two over a finite field Fq of square order\nendowed with m < \u221e hermitian forms each of which admits a non-isotropic vector. If\n\u221a\n( q + 1)m < q, then there exist two Fq -linearly independent vectors of V which are nonisotropic with respect to all forms.\nFinally we can state and prove our main result. Its proof has been strongly influenced\nby the proof of [2, Theorem 1.1], [3, Chapter II, Proposition 12].\nTheorem 4.6\nLet V be an (n + 1)-dimensional vector space over a field K. Let \u03c3 be an automorphism\nof K of order one or two.\nT Let (\u0393j )1\u2264j\u2264m be a finite family of generalized Phan geometries\nof V . Finally, let \u0393 = j \u0393j . In case K = Fq assume 2n m < q, if \u03c3 has order one, and\n\u221a\n2n\u22121 ( q + 1)m < q, if \u03c3 has order two.\nThen |\u0393| is homotopy equivalent to a (non-trivial) wedge of (n \u2212 1)-spheres.\nProof: We proceed by induction on n.\n\nT\nFor n = 1, the vector space V is two-dimensional. The geometry \u0393 = 1\u2264j\u2264m \u0393j consists\nof all those one-dimensional subspaces of V that are non-degenerate with respect to each\nof the m hermitian forms of rank one or two induced by the \u0393j on V . In case K finite and\n\u03c3 6= id, apply Lemma 4.5. Otherwise apply Lemma 4.4 to the FixK (\u03c3)-span of a K-basis of\nV . In both cases we find two K-linearly independent vectors of V which are non-isotropic\nwith respect to all forms. Hence |\u0393| is a wedge of 0-spheres.\n\nAssume now that the theorem is true for any family of size m of generalized Phan geometries\n\u221a\ninside a vector space of dimension k < n + 1 satisfying 2k\u22121m < q, resp. 2k\u22122 ( q + 1)m < q\nin case K is a finite field of order q.\nLet p be a one-dimensional subspace of V which for each of the generalized Phan geometries\n\u0393j is non-degenerate with respect to the unique hermitian form defined on the whole vector\nspace V . Such a one-dimensional space p exists by Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5 via an argument\nas above. Define\nY0 := {W \u2208 \u0393 | hp, W i \u2208 \u0393}.\n\nNote that Y0 contains all subspaces of V which contain p and which are contained in \u0393.\nMoreover, define\nYi = Yi\u22121 \u222a {W \u2208 \u0393 | dim W = n + 1 \u2212 i}\n\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Obviously, we have Y0 \u2286 Y1 \u2286 * * * \u2286 Yn = \u0393. Each set Yi together with\nthe inclusion relation inside V forms a poset, so that it makes sense to use the symbols | * |\nand \u2217 in this context.\n\nWe are going to use Lemma 2.6 and an induction on i to prove that |Yi | is homotopy\nequivalent to a wedge of (n \u2212 1)-spheres for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\n10\n\n\fi = 0: Y0 is contractible, because U 7\u2192 hU, pi 7\u2192 hpi, U \u2208 Y0 , is a chain of deformation\nretractions.\ni \u2212 1 \u2192 i: Apply Lemma 2.6 with Z = |Yi | and Z \u2032 = |Yi\u22121| and Aj = StYi (Uj ) for\nUj \u2208 Yi \\Yi\u22121 .

By Theorem 4.6 the link Lk|\u0393| (s) is homotopy\nequivalent to a wedge of dim(Lk|\u0393| (s))-spheres, whence for each p < dim(Lk|\u0393| (s)) the\nreduced homology group H\u0303p (Lk|\u0393| (s)) is trivial. Therefore |\u0393| is Cohen-Macaulay.\n\u2737\nWe pointed out in Example 3.3 that for t = 0 and K finite of square order the generalized\nPhan geometry on a K-vector space equals the complex studied in [10] to re-prove Phan's\nfirst theorem [21]. One crucial step in [10] is the proof of simple connectedness of that\ngeometry. Theorem 4.6 yields more information about the homotopy type of that geometry,\nhowever only with an exponential instead of a constant bound on the size of the field.\nThe constant m is replaced by 1, because we are interested in the homotopy type of one\ngeneralized Phan geometry, not the intersection of several generalized Phan geometries.\nCorollary 4.8\nLet K be a field, let \u03c3 be an automorphism of K of order one or two, let V be an (n + 1)dimensional vector space over K endowed with a non-degenerate \u03c3-hermitian form, and\nlet \u0393 be the complex of proper non-trivial non-degenerate subspaces of V . In case K = Fq\n\u221a\nassume 2n < q, if \u03c3 has order one, and 2n\u22121 ( q + 1) < q, if \u03c3 has order two.\nThen |\u0393| is Cohen-Macaulay. In particular, |\u0393| is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of\n(n \u2212 1)-spheres.\nThe sphericity of the geometry opposite a chamber is also obtained as a corollary of\nTheorem 4.6 for a generalized Phan geometry with t = n, cf. Example 3.4. As all \u03c3hermitian forms \u03c9i have rank one and hence the zeros form a hyperplane, we can replace\n\u221a\nq + 1, resp. 2 by 1 in the bound (cf. the proofs of Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5) and achieve\nexactly the same bound as in [3, Chapter II, Theorem B].\n\n12\n\n\fCorollary 4.9\nLet K be a field, let V be an (n + 1)-dimensional vector space over K, and let \u0393 be the\ngeometry opposite a chamber of V . In case K = Fq assume 2n\u22121 < q.\nThen |\u0393| is Cohen-Macaulay. In particular, |\u0393| is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of\n(n \u2212 1)-spheres.\nWe still need to provide statement and proof of Lemma 4.12 which we used for proving\nTheorem 4.6. For this endeavour projections as used in [9] and [18] turn out to be useful.\nRecall the following fact from linear algebra.\nLemma 4.10\nLet K be a field, let \u03c3 be an automorphism of K of order one or two, let V be an (n + 1)dimensional vector space over K, and let \u03c9 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 K be a \u03c3-hermitian form. Moreover,\nlet W be an arbitrary subspace of V and let p be a one-dimensional subspace of V which\nis non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9 and which intersects W trivially.\nThen\n\u0001\n\u03c9 p : V \u00d7 V \u2192 K : (v, w) 7\u2192 \u03c9 p (v, w) := \u03c9 prp\u22a5\u03c9 (v), prp\u22a5\u03c9 (w)\n\nwhere prp\u22a5\u03c9 denotes the projection onto the second summand of the direct decomposition\nV = p \u2295 p\u22a5\u03c9 , is a \u03c3-hermitian form with\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\nprW Rad \u03c9|hW,pi\u00d7hW,pi = Rad \u03c9 p |W \u00d7W\n\nwhere prW denotes the projection onto the second summand of the direct decomposition\nhW, pi = p \u2295 W .\n\nProof: Let t \u2208 Rad(\u03c9|hW,pi\u00d7hW,pi), i.e. t \u2208 hW, pi and \u03c9(t, x) = 0 for all x \u2208 hW, pi,\nin particular \u03c9(t, p) = 0, i.e. t \u2208 p\u22a5\u03c9 . Write t = w + v for w \u2208 W and v \u2208 p, so that\nprW (t) = w. Notice that, if x \u2208 W , then prp\u22a5\u03c9 (x) \u2208 hW, pi.

Their proofs consist of elementary\nbut extremely technical arguments from linear algebra.\nLemma 4.11\nLet \u0393 be a generalized Phan geometry of an (n + 1)-dimensional K-vector space V with\nrespect to a flag F = {Vi | 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t + 1} with forms (\u03c9i )0\u2264i\u2264t . Let p be an \u03c9t -nondegenerate one-dimensional subspace of V and let U \u2208 \u0393 be an element of \u0393 not containing\np. Furthermore, let\n\u2206 := {x \u2208 \u0393 | hx, pi \u2208 \u0393}.\nIf \u0393<U = {x \u2208 \u0393 | x ( U} is non-empty, then \u0393<U \u2229 \u2206 is an intersection of at most two\ngeneralized Phan geometries of U.\n\nProof: The geometry \u0393<U is isomorphic to the generalized Phan geometry\u0001of U with\nrespect to the flag {Vi \u2229 U | kU \u2264 i \u2264 t + 1} and forms \u03c9i|(U \u2229Vi+1 )\u00d7(U \u2229Vi+1 ) k \u2264i\u2264t , cf.\nU\nLemma 4.2 and its proof. To determine the isomorphism type of the intersection \u0393<U \u2229 \u2206,\nlet W\nU be an element of \u0393<U . The vector space W is contained in \u0393<U \u2229 \u2206 if\nand only if hp, W i is an element of \u0393. By definition, we have hp, W i \u2208 \u0393 if and only if\nhp, W i \u22d4V F with hp, W i\u2229Vkhp,W i+1 non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9khp,W i where, as before,\nkhp,W i := min{i \u2208 {0, . . . , t} | hp, W i \u2229 Vi+1 6= {0}}.\nClearly, hp, W i \u22d4V F if and only if W \u22d4U FUp where FUp := {hVi , pi \u2229 U | 0 \u2264 i \u2264 lU } with\nlU := min{0 \u2264 i \u2264 t + 1 | hVi , pi \u2229 U = U}. Note that lU is always equal to t + 1, except\nwhen Vt is a hyperplane of V , in which case lU = t.\n\nUsing notations from Lemma 4.10, we define\n\nfor 0 \u2264 i \u2264 lU .\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c9 pi : V \u00d7 V \u2192 K : (v, w) 7\u2192 \u03c9 i prp\u22a5\u03c9i (v), prp\u22a5\u03c9i (w)\n\nWe have khp,W i = min{i \u2208 {0, . . . , lU } | W \u2229 hVi , pi \u2229 U 6= {0}} =: j. Moreover, we claim\nthat hp, W i \u2229 Vj+1 is non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9j if and only if W \u2229 (hVj+1, pi \u2229 U)\nis non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9 pj |(hV ,pi\u2229U )\u00d7(hV ,pi\u2229U ) . The intersection hp, W i \u2229 Vj+1\nj+1\nj+1\nis non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9j if and only if hhp, W i \u2229 Vj+1, pi = hW, pi \u2229 hVj+1, pi =\nhW \u2229 hVj+1 , pi, pi is non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9 j (this is obvious for j = t and follows\nfrom the fact that p \u22a5\u03c9 j Vj+1 by Lemma 4.1 for j < t). Since p is non-degenerate with\nrespect to \u03c9 j and p 6\u2286 W \u2229 hVj+1 , pi, we can apply Lemma 4.10 and obtain\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\n= Rad \u03c9 j |(W \u2229hV ,pi)\u00d7(W \u2229hV ,pi) .\nprW \u2229hVj+1 ,pi Rad \u03c9 j |hW \u2229hV ,pi,pi\u00d7hW \u2229hV ,pi,pi\nj+1\n\nj+1\n\nj+1\n\nj+1\n\nTherefore hW \u2229hVj+1 , pi, pi is non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9 j if and only if hVj+1, pi\u2229W\nis non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9 pj , because p is non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9 j . Since\nhVj+1, pi \u2229 W \u2282 U, the above claim is proved.\n\nNotice that the family (hVi , pi \u2229 U)0\u2264i\u2264lU may contain some subspace of U more than once.\nSince dim(hVi , pi \u2229 U) = dim(Vi \u2229 U) + 1 if and only if p \u2286 hVi , Ui and i 6= t + 1, and\n14\n\n\fsince the subspaces Vi form a flag, the only subspaces of U that can occur more than once\nin that family are zero-dimensional or one-dimensional. Notice that there is at least one\none-dimensional subspace in FUp exactly when p \u2286 hVkU , Ui. Since the \u03c3-hermitian form on\nthe one-dimensional subspace of the flag of a generalized Phan geometry does not really\nplay any role - none of the transversal spaces have a non-trivial intersection with this\nspace - we can choose an arbitrary non-degenerate \u03c3-hermitian form \u03c9 on that subspace\n(which will be the first form of the generalized Phan geometry).\nIt remains to check the radical property\n\u0011\n\u0010\nRad \u03c9 pi |(hVi+1 ,pi\u2229U )\u00d7(hVi+1 ,pi\u2229U ) = hVi , pi \u2229 U\n\nfor the relevant incides i. Let us start with kU + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t. By Lemma 4.10, we have\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\nprhVi+1 ,pi\u2229U Rad \u03c9 i|hhVi+1 ,pi\u2229U,pi\u00d7hhVi+1 ,pi\u2229U,pi\n= Rad \u03c9 i |(hVi+1 ,pi\u2229U )\u00d7(hVi+1 ,pi\u2229U ) .\n\nSince hhVi+1 , pi\u2229U, pi = hVi+1 , pi\u2229hU, pi, it suffices to determine the \u03c9 i -radical of hVi+1 , pi\u2229\nhU, pi - which is Vi \u2229 hU, pi - and to project it onto hVi+1 , pi \u2229 U - which results in\nhVi , pi \u2229 U.\n\nIn view of our comments on the spaces Vi with hVi , pi \u2229 U one-dimensional, the only\nremaining relevant index is i = kU . In case hVkU , pi \u2229 U one-dimensional, we deduce\nthat p is contained in the span of VkU and U, so that by symmetry VkU \u2229 hU, pi is onedimensional as well. Since VkU +1 \u2229 hU, pi = (U \u2229 VkU +1 ) \u2295 (VkU \u2229 hU, pi), this implies that\nVkU \u2229 hU, pi is the \u03c9 kU -radical of hVkU +1 , pi \u2229 hU, pi and, thus, its projection hVkU , pi \u2229\nU onto hVkU +1 , pi \u2229 U is the \u03c9 pkU -radical, so that the arguments from above apply. In\nthis case,\nFUp is in fact {{0}} \u222a {hVi , pi \u2229 U\u0013 | kU \u2264 i \u2264 lU }, to which we associate the\n\u0012 \u0010\n\u0011\nforms \u03c9, \u03c9 pi |(hVi+1 ,pi\u2229U )\u00d7(hVi+1 ,pi\u2229U )\n. We just showed that they satisfy the radical\nkU \u2264i\u2264lU\n\nproperty.\n\nIn case hVkU , pi \u2229 U zero-dimensional, however, the space hVkU +1 , pi \u2229 hU, pi may be \u03c9 kU non-degenerate or may have a one-dimensional \u03c9 kU -radical, and so hVkU +1 , pi \u2229 U may be\n\u03c9 pkU -non-degenerate or may have a one-dimensional \u03c9 pkU -radical R.\n\u0011\n\u0010\n= {0} = hVkU , pi \u2229 U, and FUp\nIn the first case R = Rad \u03c9 pkU |(hV\n,pi\u2229U )\u00d7(hV\n,pi\u2229U )\nkU +1\n\nkU +1\n\nis in fact {{0}} \u222a {hVi , pi \u2229 U | kU +\u00131 \u2264 i \u2264 lU }, to which we associate the forms\n\u0012\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c9, \u03c9 pi |(hVi+1 ,pi\u2229U )\u00d7(hVi+1 ,pi\u2229U )\n. We just showed that they satisfy the radical\nproperty.\n\nkU +1\u2264i\u2264lU\n\nIn the second case, notice that FUp does not contain a one-dimensional space and so we can\n+\ndefine a slightly modified flag FUp := FUp \u222a {R}, which is in fact {{0}, R} \u222a {hVi , pi \u2229 U |\nkU + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 lU }. Define also an arbitrary non-degenerate \u03c3-hermitian form\n\u03c9+ : R \u00d7 R \u2192 K.\n15\n\n\fWe then associate to\n\nFUp +\n\nthe forms\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9+ ,\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c9 pi |(hVi+1 ,pi\u2229U )\u00d7(hVi+1 ,pi\u2229U )\n\n\u0011\n\nkU +1\u2264i\u2264lU\n\n\u0013\n. Now FUp +\n\nand these forms satisfy the radical property. Since we changed the flag, there are still\na few things to be checked in order to show that hp, W i \u2208 \u0393 if and only if W is in\nthe generalized Phan geometry of U with respect to the flag FUp + and forms as described.\np\nAssume hp, W i \u2208 \u0393. We already proved that W is transversal\n\u0011\n\u0010 to FU , so we just need to show\n\nthat W \u2229 R = {0}. This intersection is contained in Rad \u03c9 pkU |(hV\n\nkU +1 ,pi\u2229W )\u00d7(hVkU +1 ,pi\u2229W )\n\n.\n\nIf hVkU +1 , pi \u2229 W = {0} we are done. If hVkU +1 , pi \u2229 W 6= {0}, then hW, pi \u2229 VkU +1 6= {0},\nand so khp,W i = kU (since hW, pi \u2229 VkU = {0}). Therefore by hypothesis hW, pi \u2229 VkU +1\nis non-degenerate with respect to \u03c9kU , and so, as shown above, W \u2229 hVkU +1 , pi is nondegenerate with respect to \u03c9 pkU |(hV\n. Hence W \u2229 R = {0}. Finally, we\n,pi\u2229U )\u00d7(hV\n,pi\u2229U )\nkU +1\n\nkU +1\n\nhave that khp,W i = min{i \u2208 {kU + 1, . . . , lU } | W \u2229 (hVi , pi \u2229 U) 6= {0}}, and so we can\nconclude by the same argument as above. Since W \u22d4U FUp + implies W \u22d4U FUp and W \u2229 R\nmust be trivial, the reverse implication is immediate.\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection \u0393<U \u2229 \u2206 is isomorphic to the intersection of the generalized\n\u0001\nPhan geometry of U with respect to the flag (Vi \u2229U)kU \u2264i\u2264t+1 and forms \u03c9i|(Vi+1 \u2229U )\u00d7(Vi+1 \u2229U ) k\n+\n\nand the generalized Phan geometry of U with respect to the flag FUp (respectively, FUp )\nand forms as described above.\n\u2737\nSimilar to Lemma 4.3 the following is immediate from Lemma 4.11.\n\nLemma 4.12\nLet (\u0393j )j be a finite family of m generalized Phan geometries of V with respect to flags\nF j = {Vij | 0 \u2264 i \u2264 tj + 1} with forms (\u03c9ij )0\u2264i\u2264tj .

For more details and background information we refer the\nreader to [14] and [16].\n16\n\nU \u2264i\u2264t\n\n\fOur applications depend on the following fact. Example 3.6 indicates how to prove its\ncorrectness for a (twin) building B of type An . A special case is treated in [11].\nFact 5.1\nLet B be a twin building with a Phan involution \u03c4 . Let R be a spherical residue of type\nL\ni\u2208I Ani of B. Then the geometry associated to the chamber system A\u03c4 (R) is a direct\nsum of generalized Phan geometries of type Ani .\nA Phan involution \u03c4 is an involution interchanging both parts of a twin building isometrically and satisfying an additional technical condition. The chamber system A\u03c4 (R)\nconsists of all those chambers of R with minimal possible codistance from their image\nunder \u03c4 , cf. Example 3.6. Detailed discussions can be found in [14] and [16].\nThe first set of applications of Theorem 4.6 deals with the revision program of Phan's\nresults [21], [22].\nTheorem 5.2\nLet K be a field containing sufficiently many elements, let \u03c3 be an automorphism of K of\norder one or two, let \u2206 be a graph without triangles, and let B be a twin building of type\n\u2206 over K with a Phan involution \u03c4 that induces \u03c3 on K.\nThen the Phan geometry B\u03c4 , i.e., the subsystem of chambers of the positive half of B\nmapped onto an opposite one by \u03c4 , is 2-simply connected.\nSketch of proof: By the criterion of simple connectedness from [14] it remains to prove\nthat for residues R of rank two, resp. three the chamber system A\u03c4 (R) is connected, resp.\nsimply connected. Since therefore one only has to deal with the connectedness properties of\nchambers systems of rank two or three, by [25] one can equivalently study connectedness\nproperties of the corresponding geometries. By Fact 5.1 it suffices to study generalized\nPhan geometries of type A2 and A3 or direct sums of generalized Phan geometries. By\nTheorem 4.6 the generalized Phan geometries of type A2 are connected and the generalized\nPhan geometries of type A3 are simply connected, if the field K contains sufficiently many\nelements. A direct sum of two rank one geometries is always connected and a direct sum\nof a rank one and a connected rank two geometry is always simply connected. Hence the\nclaim follows.\n\u2737\nThe following result is implied by Theorem 5.2. It has first been stated in [22] and then\nre-proven via a direct computation based on [14] by Hoffman, Shpectorov and two of the\nauthors during an RiP stay in Oberwolfach in summer 2005. For the definition of a group\nwith a weak Phan system, we refer the reader to the survey [8], the thesis [15], and the\nresearch paper [10].\nCorollary 5.3\nLet n \u2265 3, let q \u2265 5, let \u2206 \u2208 {An , Dn , E6 , E7 , E8 }, and let K be a group with a weak Phan\nsystem of type \u2206 over Fq2 . Then K is a central quotient of SUn+1 (q 2 ), Spin\u00b1\n2n (q), or the\nsimply connected version of 2 E6 (q 2 ), E7 (q), E8 (q), respectively.\n17\n\n\fSketch of proof: Since q \u2265 5, the inequalities 2(q+1) < q 2 and 22 (q+1) < q 2 are satisfied,\nso that by Theorem 4.6 and Theorem 5.2 the Phan geometry B\u03c4 with respect to the building\nof type \u2206 over Fq2 and the unique semilinear Phan involution \u03c4 , is simply connected. By\n[8], [10], [15] the simple connectedness of B\u03c4 implies that K is the universal enveloping\ngroup of the Phan amalgam contained in K. The claim follows from the classification of\nunambiguous noncollapsing Phan amalgams in [10], [15], by which there exists a unique\nPhan amalgam up to passing to quotients.\n\u2737\nAs for the second set of applications the Main Theorem can be used in order to establish\ntopological finiteness properties of so-called unitary forms of Kac-Moody groups over finite\nfields. The following statement is a first rough attempt.\nCorollary 5.4\nLet n \u2265 3, let q \u2265 5, let \u2206 be a graph without triangles, and let G be a Kac-Moody group\nof type \u2206 over Fq2 . Let \u03c4 be the product of the Chevalley involution of G and the field\ninvolution.\nThen the group K := FixG (\u03c4 ) is finitely presented.\nSketch of proof: As in the sketch of Corollary 5.3, the Phan geometry B\u03c4 with respect\nto the twin building of type \u2206 over Fq2 is simply connected. Again as before the simple\nconnectedness of B\u03c4 implies that K is the universal enveloping group of the Phan amalgam\ncontained in K. Since this Phan amalgam consists of finite groups, the group K is finitely\npresented.\n\u2737\nMore sophisticated statements are possible if one uses the existing machinery for topological finiteness properties, notably Brown's criteria [12]. The following theorem deals\nwith the topological finiteness length of the unitary form of a Kac-Moody group of type\n\u00c3n over the field Fq2 .\nTheorem 5.5\nLet n \u2265 2, let q be be a prime power satisfying 2n\u22121 (q + 1) < q 2 , and let \u03c3 be the involution\nof the field Fq2 (t) mapping t to t\u22121 and acting as the field involution on Fq2 . Then the\ngroup\nK := SUn+1 (Fq2 [t, t\u22121 ], \u03c3) = {A \u2208 SLn+1 (Fq2 [t, t\u22121 ]) | (A\u22121 )\u03c3 = AT }\nis of type Fn\u22121 and not of type Fn .\nSketch of proof: This follows by Brown's criterion [12, Corollary 3.3] applied to the\nen for\nfiltration (Cn )n\u2208N from [14] of the positive half B+ of the twin building of type A\n\u22121\nthe Kac-Moody group SLn+1 (Fq2 [t, t ]). The relative links again are generalized Phan\ngeometries by Fact 5.1, which are spherical by Theorem 4.6. The group K is a subgroup of\nthe locally compact group SLn+1 (Fq2 ((t))) and since \u03c3 interchanges t and t\u22121 it is necessarily\ndiscrete. As the cell stabilisers of the action of SLn+1 (Fq2 ((t))) on B+ are compact, the cell\nstabilisers in its discrete subgroup K have to be finite. Therefore the cell stabilisers in K\nare of type F\u221e . Finally, using the surjectivity of the norm map Fq2 \u2192 Fq one can prove\n18\n\n\fthat for each n \u2208 N the group K acts transitively on the layer Cn \\Cn\u22121 of the filtration,\nso that the filtration is cocompact.\n\u2737\nRemark 5.6 It is elementary but not straightforward to see that the group SUn+1 (Fq2 [t, t\u22121 ], \u03c3)\nfrom Theorem 5.5 is an arithmetic subgroup of SLn+1 (Fq2 (t)). Hence, for the sake of brevity\nof this remark, we allow ourselves the liberty to use some very heavy machinery in order to\nestablish this arithmeticity: By [19] the group SUn+1 (Fq2 [t, t\u22121 ], \u03c3) is a lattice in the locally\ncompact group SLn+1 (Fq2 ((t))). Therefore by [20, Chapter IX] it is an arithmetic subgroup\nof SLn+1 (Fq2 (t)). This means that Theorem 5.5 states that the topological finiteness length\nof SUn+1 (Fq2 [t, t\u22121 ], \u03c3) equals its local rank minus one, which is another piece of evidence\nin favour of the rank conjecture on the finiteness lengths of S-arithmetic groups; cf. [7].\n\nReferences\n[1] Herbert Abels, Finiteness properties of certain arithmetic groups in the function field\ncase, Israel J.
