As long as these systems can be considered\nas closed, their generic spectral and spatial properties are currently well described through the theory of Hermitian random\nmatrices from a statistical point of view. Nevertheless, no realistic system is truly closed, thus calling for a description of\nthe coupling mechanisms to the environment. Physically, the\nlatter include bulk absorption, leads or waveguides, as well\nas dissipative or radiative boundaries. In the domain of Wave\nChaos, open systems are actively investigated both from experimental and theoretical points of view (see Refs [2, 3] for\nreviews). Among the domains concerned by experimental\nstudies, one can cite: microwave cavities [4], optical microcavities [5], and elastodynamics [2, 6].\nTo analyze these open chaotic systems, the scattering approach was found to be a powerful theory [3]. In this framework, a system composed of N resonances is analyzed in\nterms of a N \u00d7N non-Hermitian random matrix, the so-called\neffective Hamiltonian:\ni\nHeff = H \u2212 V V \u2020 ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere its Hermitian part H corresponds to the Hamiltonian of\nthe closed system and its anti-Hermitian part \u2212 2i V V \u2020 models\nthe coupling to the environment. More precisely, the openness is introduced by means of the N \u00d7 M coupling matrix\nV whose elements Vnj connect the n = 1, . . . , N states to the\nj = 1, . . . , M scattering channels [1]. The non-Hermiticity\nof Heff yields a set of complex eigenvalues {En } associated to\ntwo distinct sets of eigenvectors called left {h\u03c8\u0303n |} and right\n{|\u03c8n i} eigenvectors:\nHeff |\u03c8n i = En |\u03c8n i ,\n\nh\u03c8\u0303n |Heff = h\u03c8\u0303n |En ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the eigenvalue En = En \u2212 i\u0393n /2 gives respectively the\nenergy En and the resonance width \u0393n of the nth resonance.\nThe left and right eigenvectors, which describe the resonance\nstates respectively for systems with positive or negative gain,\n\nFIG. 1. Real (on the left) and imaginary (on the right) component of\nthe 500th resonance state obtained by means of the Finite Element\nMethod.\n\nform a bi-orthogonal and complete set which can be normalized by: h\u03c8\u0303n |\u03c8n i = \u03b4nm .\nWhile field statistics of open chaotic systems have been\nsystematically studied for a given energy and considering\nthe energy as a continuous parameter (see [4] and references\ntherein), statistics of resonance states i.e. left and right eigenvectors of Heff , for TRS systems are less understood. For\nthese systems, the impact of the openness is to turn real eigenfunctions into complex internal wavefunctions associated to\nresonances. This complexness being uniquely related to the\npresence of currents inside the system [7, 8] (after a phase rotation leading to independent real and imaginary components\n[9]). In order to quantify the presence of currents, one can\nuse the complexness parameter qn2 introduced by Lobkis and\nWeaver [10] as the ratio of the variance of the imaginary and\nreal parts of the nth resonance state.\nMaking use of right eigenvectors:\n\u0002 i\u0003 2\nP\ni (Im \u03c8n )\n2\n,\n(3)\nqn = P\ni 2\ni (Re [\u03c8n ])\n\nwhere \u03c8ni corresponds to the ith component of the right eigenvector (we note that qn2 can also be defined using left eigenvectors). This parameter has recently gained attention both\nexperimentally [6, 11] and theoretically [12, 13] in particular\ndue to its relationship to the resonance width. A linear relationship between qn and \u0393n was first noticed by Barth\u00e9lemy\net al. [11] analyzing hundreds of resonance states of a 2D\nchaotic microwave cavity at room temperature. This result\nwas then confirmed using the effective Hamiltonian formalism in the limit M \u226b 1, relevant in the experiment [12].\n\n\f2\nA linear relationship between qn and \u0393n was also verified in\nan elastodynamics experiment for a given resonance when a\nspatially extended coupling is varied [6]. Lately the complexness parameter was investigated at arbitrary M by means of its\nprobability distribution in the regime of weak coupling [13].\nThere, it was shown that the average value of qn2 is directly\nproportional to the variance of \u0393n , which constitutes the natural measure of the fluctuations of the widths.\nIt is the aim of the present work to confront our theoretical\npredictions to numerical solutions of the Maxwell equations in\na 2D chaotic microwave cavity with lossy boundaries subject\nto Ohmic dissipation. After a brief introduction to the theoretical model [13], we will describe the cavity we numerically\ninvestigate.Then we will discuss the statistical results we obtained concerning the complex wavefunctions and the widths\nof its resonance states and will compare them to the theory.\nIn the regime of weak coupling,\nwhich was shown [14] to\np\ncorrespond to the condition var(\u0393) \u226a \u2206, where \u2206 is the\nmean level spacing, the anti-Hermitian part of Heff is small\ncompared to the Hermitian part and the perturbation theory\ncan be applied. As the eigenvalues are nondegenerate with the\nprobability 1 due to the linear level repulsion at small spacings\n[1], one gets directly expressions of the spectral widths and the\ncomplexness parameters (3):\n\u0393n =\n\nM\nX\n\n(Vnj )2 ,\n\nqn2 =\n\nj=1\n\nX\n\np6=n\n\n\u03932np\n,\n(En \u2212 Ep )2\n\n(4)\n\nP\nj j\nwhere \u0393np = M\nj=1 Vn Vp and the {En } correspond to the\nenergies of the closed system. We would like to stress that qn2\nalso gives information about the non-orthogonality of eigenfunctions, with important implications in various physical situations. For example, the non-orthogonality induces an enhancement of the line width of a lasing mode [15], influences\nbranching ratios of nuclear cross sections [16] and is also investigated in open quantum maps [17, 18]. The distribution\nof the energies {En } corresponds to the eigenvalue distribution of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble with N \u2192 \u221e [1].\nThe coupling amplitudes are chosen to be real Gaussian random variables with zero mean and covariance Vnj Vmk =\n\u03c3 2 \u03b4nm \u03b4 jk [19]. To obtain an analytical expression\nof the\nPM\nj j\ndistribution, we use the fact that \u0393np =\nV\nV\nj=1 n p can\nbe viewed as a scalar product between M -dimensional vectors andpthen can be expressed using polar variables [19]:\n\u0393np = \u0393n \u0393p cos \u03b8np . The complexness parameter is now\ngiven by:\nqn2 = \u0393n\n\nX\n\np6=n\n\nAnp\n,\n4(En \u2212 Ep )2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Anp = \u0393p cos2 \u03b8np . Considering that the widths are\ngiven by a sum of M squared independent Gaussian random\nvariables (4), the distribution of the rescaled widths \u03b3 = \u0393/\u03c3 2\n(with h\u03b3i = M ) is given by a \u03c72 distribution with M degrees\nof freedom:\n\n\u03c72M (\u03b3) =\n\n1\n2M/2 \u0393(M/2)\n\n\u03b3 M/2\u22121 e\u2212\u03b3/2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nand a further calculation shows that A satisfies the PorterThomas distribution [13]: P (A/\u03c3 2 ) = \u03c72M=1 which is independent of M . The distribution of the rescaled parame\u03c34 2\nGOE\nter Xn \u2261 \u2206\n(X) = h\u03b4(X \u2212 Xn )i,\n2 qn , is defined by PM\nwhere the statistical averages are performed over the energies\n{En }, the resonances widths {\u0393n } and the {An }. By making\nuse of group integral methods [15] it reads:\n2\n\nGOE\nPM\n(X) =\n\n\u03c0 (3+M)\n\u03c0 2 M 1 + 4X\n,\n\u03c0 2 M/2+2\n24X 2 (1 + 4X\n)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere strong mode-to-mode fluctuations clearly appear, embodied in the power law tail 1/X 2 of the distribution.\nIn the following, this prediction will be compared with the\nnumerical solutions of the Maxwell equations in a 2D chaotic\nmicrowave cavity. The chaotic cavity we consider has a quarter of a stadium shape with a radius of R = 1 m and a length\nof l = 2 m (see Fig. 1). In order to reduce the bouncing\nball modes between the two parallel sides, an oblique cut is\nperformed on one side and a movable perfectly reflecting half\ndisk of diameter d = 0.3 m is placed on the opposite side. The\nabsorbing boundary condition is imposed on an adjustable\npart of the upper arc of circle of the cavity. For the TM polarization, the electromagnetic field (E, H) inside the cavity is\nuniquely characterized by the single component of the electric\nfield: \u03c8(r) = Ez (r), where r = (x, y). The field component\nis solution of the Helmholtz equation:\n\u2212\n\n\u0010 \u22022\n\u03c9\u0303 2\n\u22022 \u0011\n\u03c8(r) = 2 \u03c8(r) ,\n+\n2\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\nc\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03c9\u0303 is a complex angular frequency and c the light velocity. Starting from the ideal closed system where the field\nsatisfies the Dirichlet boundary condition i.e. an infinite conductivity along the whole contour of the cavity: \u03c8 (0) |C = 0,\nthe openness is introduced through a finite conductivity \u03c3c on\na length labs of the contour. To first order, the electric field \u03c8\nalong the lossy contour is then given by:\nr\n1\n~ (0) ,\n\u03c8 \u2243 \u2212(1 + i)\nn\u0302 * \u2207\u03c8\n(9)\n2\u03bc0 \u03c3c \u03c9\nwhere \u03c3c is the effective conductivity of the contour, and n\u0302\nis the unit normal vector directed toward the interior of the\nconductor [11, 20].\nAs we examine resonance states, the Finite Element\nMethod [21] reveals to be very efficient to solve the time independent wave equation (8). Using the commercial software\nComsolTM, we are able to obtain the complex eigenvalues\n\u03c9\u0303n = \u03c9n \u2212 i\u03b6n /2 and the resonance states \u03c8n of the first 800\nresonances. To increase the statistical samples at our disposal,\nensemble averages were performed by sliding the half disk reflector along the largest side of the cavity (ensuring a constant\n\n\f3\narea and perimeter of the cavity) with 7 different positions\nwell enough separated to produce completely statistically independent spectra leading to samples of 2100 resonances for\neach numerical distribution. To compare the numerical results\nfrom the electromagnetic cavity with the theoretical model,\nthe usual correspondence between (En , \u0393n ) and (\u03c9n2 , \u03c9n \u03b6n ) is\nperformed.\nIn the 2D chaotic cavity we study, the number of channels\nM is related to the effective absorbing length labs along the\nboundary. This number can be evaluated by using the Sabine's\nlaw of reverberation known in room acoustics [12]. This law is\nformally equivalent to the so-called Weisskopf's estimate for\nthe level width (well-known in Nuclear Physics [19]) provided\nthe effective number of channels be related to the absorbing\nperimeter through the intuitive relationship :\nM=\n\nlabs\n,\n\u03bb/2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03bb = 2\u03c0c/\u03c9 is the wavelength. Clearly, as this estimate\nis frequency dependent, to compare numerical distributions\nto our theoretical predictions, one must use samples of resonances for which the parameter M is approximately a constant. This can be achieved by considering resonances within\nhigh-frequency intervals. Indeed, as the cumulated number of\nlevels grows like \u03c9 2 and M like \u03c9 (according to (10)), the relative variation of M within a sequence of \u2206N adjacent levels\naround the N th level is given by \u2206M/M = 21 \u2206N/N . In\npractice, we considered intervals of 100 adjacent resonances\nabove the 300th resonance. To explore various numbers of\nchannels, namely two frequency ranges were considered :\nfrom the 300th to the 400th resonances (\u2206M/M \u2243 14%), and\nfrom the 700th to the 800th resonance (\u2206M/M \u2243 7%), and\nthree different lengths of the absorbing part of the perimeter :\nlabs = \u03c0/18, labs = \u03c0/6 and labs = \u03c0/2 (in unit of radius). It\nis also important to note that the theoretical distribution of the\ncomplexness parameter (7) being established in the regime of\nweak coupling, the conductivitypof the absorbing part of the\nperimeter was chosen such that var(\u0393)/\u2206 < 10\u22122 .\nFig. 2 shows the distributions of the spectral widths z =\n\u03b3/ h\u03b3i of the cavity compared to the \u03c72 distribution (6). Four\ndifferent sets of values of the absorbing lengths, conductivities\nand frequency ranges are used (see caption). For each interval\nof frequency, the number M of channels used for the comparison corresponds to the nearest integer value of relation (10)\ncomputed with the median value of the wavelength in each interval. The remarkable agreement demonstrates that the concept of effective independent coupling channels is physically\nrelevant to describe continuously distributed losses. Note that\nthe number of channels can also be obtained through the first\ntwo moments of the width distribution (6):\nM=\n\n2\n2\nh\u03b3 2 i / h\u03b3i\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nWe checked that except for the smallest value M = 3 the\nestimates (10) and (11) agree within a few percents. In the\n\nworst case (M = 3) the discrepancy is only of 17%, consistent\nwith the relative variation of M given above.\nThus, having validated the description of losses through the\nintroduction of effective scattering channels, whose number\nM is solely fixed through the length of the absorbing part of\nthe boundary, the numerical distribution of the complexness\nparameter X is finally compared to the theoretical prediction\n(Fig. 3) for the same absorbing lengths, conductivities, and\nfrequency ranges as those given in Fig. 2. The excellent agreement, even in the tail of the distribution, confirms that the\nprediction (7), obtained within the perturbation theory, contains the essential features to account for the complexness of\nthe resonance states due to spatially continuously distributed\nlosses.\nIn conclusion, we investigated the statistics of complex resonance states in an open 2D chaotic microwave cavity by solving the Maxwell equations in a cavity whose boundary is subject to Ohmic losses. We successfully compared the statistics\nof its resonance states and associated widths with the predictions of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian model. In the\nlimit of weak coupling, we have shown that spatially continuously distributed losses could be mapped to a discrete model\ninvolving a finite number M of coupling channels, which constitutes a variable parameter in the cavity. To our knowledge,\nthese results are the first unambiguous confirmation of the adequacy of an effective Random Matrix description to account\nfor the spectral and spatial statistics of an open chaotic wave\nsystem with continuously distributed losses.\nWe wish to thank Laurent Labont\u00e9 for his helpful support\nwith ComsolTM .\n\n[1] H.-J.
