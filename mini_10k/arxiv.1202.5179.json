Specifically, simulations and observations show that they trigger star formation events, and young objects at least as\nmassive as globular clusters can be formed. Among the merger environments, luminous (LIRGs; Lbol \u223c LIR = L[8\u22121000\u03bcm] = 1011 -1012 L\u2299 ) and ultraluminous (ULIRGs;\nLIR = L[8\u22121000\u03bcm] = 1012 -1013 L\u2299 ) infrared galaxies show the most extreme cases of star\nformation.\nIt is not surprising that the studies carried out so far on (U)LIRGs have found young\ncompact star forming regions. However, only a few studies have been carried out to date\nfor these kind of systems. This thesis work is devoted to the analysis of compact star\nforming regions (knots) in a representative sample of 32 (U)LIRGs, the largest sample\nused for this kind of study in these systems. The project is based mainly on optical\nhigh angular resolution images taken with the ACS and WFPC2 cameras on board\nthe HST telescope, data from a high spatial resolution simulation of a major galaxy\nencounter, and with the combination of optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) taken\nwith the INTEGRAL (WHT) and VIMOS (VLT) instruments. This is the first time that\nsuch combination of different types (photometric, spectroscopic and numerical) of a large\namount of data, and such detailed study is performed on these systems. A few thousand\nknots \u2013a factor of more than one order of magnitude higher than in previous studies\u2013 are\nidentified and their photometric properties are characterized as a function of the infrared\nluminosity of the system and of the interaction phase. These properties are compared\nwith those of compact objects identified in simulations of galaxy encounters. Finally,\nand with the additional use of IFS data, we search for suitable candidates to tidal dwarf\ngalaxies, setting up constraints on the formation of these objects for the (U)LIRG class.\nThe main findings and conclusions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 With a typical size of tens of pc, the knots are in general compact. Most of them\nare likely to contain sub-structure, thus to constitute complexes or aggregates of\nstar clusters.\n\u2022 Even though (U)LIRGs are known to have most of their star formation hidden by\ndust and re-emitted in the infrared, we have observed a fraction of 15% of blue,\nalmost free of extinction and luminous knots, with masses similar to or even higher\nix\n\n\fthan the super star clusters observed in other less luminous interacting systems.\n\u2022 An extinction correction, characterized by an exponential probability density function, has to be applied to the colors of the compact stellar regions identified in\nsimulations of major mergers so as to reproduce the rather broad range of colors\nsampled in knots in (U)LIRGs.\n\u2022 Knots in ULIRGs, with higher star formation rate per unit area and gas content\nthan less luminous interacting galaxies, are intrinsically more luminous (likely most\nmassive) due to size-of-sample effects.\n\u2022 Knots in ULIRGs can have both sizes and masses characteristic of stellar complexes\nor clumps detected in galaxies at high redshifts (z & 1), intrinsically more massive\nthan stellar complexes in less luminous interacting galaxies.\n\u2022 The aging of the knots rules the evolution of the color distribution during the\ninteraction. Theoretical and observational evidence shows that, as a consequence\nof the interaction process, only the most massive knots remain when the system\nrelaxes.\n\u2022 The slope of the luminosity function (LF) of the knots, compatible with \u03b1 \u22cd 2,\nis independent of the luminosity of the galaxy. There are, however, slight indications that it varies with the interaction phase, becoming steeper from early to\nlate phases of the interaction process. Supported by the simulation of a major\ngalaxy encounter, higher knot formation rates at early phases of the interaction\nwith respect to late phases, would explain this evolution of the LF.\n\u2022 Among extranuclear star-forming H\u03b1 clumps identified in 11 (U)LIRGs, with typical size up to several hundreds of pc, we identify 9 as candidates to tidal dwarf\ngalaxies. They fulfill certain criteria of mass, self-gravitation and stability. With\na production rate of 0.1 candidates per (U)LIRG systems, only a few fraction\n(< 10 %) of the general dwarf satellite population could be of tidal origin.\n\nx\n\n\fResumen\nComo resultado de las interacciones gal\u00e1cticas, las galaxias que intervienen pueden\nsufrir importantes transformaciones y, durante el proceso, se pueden dar fen\u00f3menos de\nuna envergadura extraordinaria si se compara con los procesos que tienen lugar en galaxias con poca formaci\u00f3n estelar. En concreto, tanto las simulaciones como las observaciones han demostrado que estas interacciones desencadenan eventos de formaci\u00f3n\nestelar en donde se pueden formar objetos j\u00f3venes tan o m\u00e1s masivos que los c\u00famulos\nglobulares. Las galaxias luminosas (LIRGs; Lbol \u223c LIR = L[8\u22121000\u03bcm] = 1011 -1012 L\u2299 )\ny ultraluminosas (ULIRGs; LIR = L[8\u22121000\u03bcm] = 1012 -1013 L\u2299 ) en el infrarrojo muestran\nlos casos m\u00e1s extremos de formaci\u00f3n estelar dentro del entorno de las interacciones.\nPor ello, no es de extra\u00f1ar que se hayan detectado regiones compactas de formaci\u00f3n\nestelar reciente en todas las investigaciones llevadas a cabo en muestras de (U)LIRGs.\nNo obstante, s\u00f3lo unos pocos estudios se han preocupado por este tipo de sistemas.\nLa presente tesis se centra en analizar regiones de formaci\u00f3n estelar compacta (nodos)\nen una muestra representativa de 32 (U)LIRGs , la muestra m\u00e1s cuantiosa que se ha\nutilizado para este tipo de estudio en estos sistemas. El proyecto se basa principalmente\nen el an\u00e1lisis de im\u00e1genes de alta resoluci\u00f3n angular tomadas en el visible con las c\u00e1maras\nACS y WFPC2, instaladas a bordo del telescopio espacial Hubble (HST), su combinaci\u00f3n\ncon espectroscop\u00eda de campo integral (IFS) obtenida con los espectr\u00f3grafos INTEGRAL\n(WHT) y VIMOS (VLT), y con datos obtenidos con una simulaci\u00f3n num\u00e9rica de alta\nresoluci\u00f3n espacial de una interacci\u00f3n mayor de galaxias. Por primera vez, se ha realizado\nun estudio tan detallado en este tipo de sistemas y con tal combinaci\u00f3n de diversos\ntipos (fotometr\u00eda, espectroscop\u00eda y simulaciones num\u00e9ricas) y cantidad de datos. Se han\nidentificado unos pocos miles de nodos, m\u00e1s de un orden de magnitud que en estudios\nanteriores. Se ha procedido a realizar una caracterizaci\u00f3n completa de sus propiedades\nfotom\u00e9tricas en funci\u00f3n de la luminosidad en infrarrojo del sistema y seg\u00fan la fase de\ninteracci\u00f3n. Se han comparado dichas propiedades con las de objetos compactos que\nse han identificado en simulaciones de interacciones de galaxias. Por \u00faltimo, y con el\nuso combinado de datos de espectrosco\u00eda integral, hemos llevado a cabo una b\u00fasqueda\nde candidatos a galaxias enanas de marea, y se han podido establecer restricciones a la\nformaci\u00f3n de este tipo de objectos para las galaxias tipo (U)LIRG. Los resultados m\u00e1s\nrelevantes se resumen a continuaci\u00f3n:\n\u2022 Con un tama\u00f1o t\u00edpico de decenas de pc, los nodos son generalmente compactos.\nLa mayor\u00eda de los mismos contienen probablemente subestructura y constituyen,\nxi\n\n\fpor lo tanto, complejos o agregados de c\u00famulos estelares.\n\u2022 Pese a que en los sistemas (U)LIRGs la mayor parte de la formaci\u00f3n estelar\nest\u00e1 escondida por el polvo, el 15% de los nodos que se han detectado son muy\nazules, con poca extinci\u00f3n y muy luminosos. Estos nodos azules poseen una\nmasa semejante e incluso mayor los a superc\u00famulos que se han observado en\ninteracciones de galaxias menos luminosas.\n\u2022 Para reproducir el ancho rango de colores de los nodos detectados en (U)LIRGs se\ntiene que aplicar cierta extinci\u00f3n a los colores obtenidos de regiones estelares\ncompactas que se han identificado en simulaciones de interacciones mayores. En\nconcreto, la extinci\u00f3n aplicada est\u00e1 caracterizada por una funci\u00f3n de densidad de\nprobabilidad exponencial.\n\u2022 Los nodos en ULIRGs, sistemas que poseen una mayor tasa de formaci\u00f3n estelar\npor unidad de \u00e1rea y contenido en gas respecto a sistemas en interacci\u00f3n menos\nluminosos, son intr\u00ednsecamente m\u00e1s luminosos (seguramente m\u00e1s masivos) debido\na efectos del tama\u00f1o de la muestra.\n\u2022 Los nodos en ULIRGs pueden ser de un tama\u00f1o y tener una masa caracter\u00edstica\nsimilar a la de los complejos o estructuras estelares que se han detectado a altos\ndesplazamientos al rojo (z & 1), intr\u00ednsecamente m\u00e1s massivos que los complejos\nestelares observados en interaciones de galaxias menos luminosas.\n\u2022 El envejecimiento de los nodos gobierna la evoluci\u00f3n de su distribuci\u00f3n de colores\na lo largo del proceso de interacci\u00f3n. Hay evidencias te\u00f3ricas y observacionales de\nque, debido a la interacci\u00f3n, \u00fanicamente los nodos m\u00e1s masivos sobreviven cuando\nel sistema se encuentra finalmente relajado.\n\u2022 La pendiente de la funci\u00f3n de luminosidad de los nodos, compatible con \u03b1 \u22cd 2,\nno depende de la luminosidad de la galaxia. No obstante, hay indicaciones de una\nligera variaci\u00f3n con la fase de interacci\u00f3n, de tal modo que dicha pendiente se\nvuelve m\u00e1s pronunciada desde \u00e9pocas tempranas a fases tard\u00edas de la interacci\u00f3n.\nUna simulaci\u00f3n num\u00e9rica de una interacci\u00f3n mayor apoya este resultado, una\nvariaci\u00f3n de la pendiente que se puede explicar si la tasa de formaci\u00f3n de nodos\nestelares es mayor en fases tempranas de la interacci\u00f3n.\n\u2022 De entre las estructuras de formaci\u00f3n estelar extranucleares que se han identificado\nen 11 (U)LIRGs y que poseen un tama\u00f1o t\u00edpico de hasta varios cientos de pc,\nxii\n\n\fnueve de ellas se han reconocido como candidatas a galaxias enanas de marea.\nEstas candidatas cumplen ciertos criterios de masa, auto-gravitaci\u00f3n y estabilidad.\nCon una tasa de producci\u00f3n estimada de 0.1 candidatas por sistema (U)LIRG, s\u00f3lo\nuna peque\u00f1a fracci\u00f3n (< 10 %) de la polaci\u00f3n de galaxias sat\u00e9lites enanas se puede\nhaber formado como una TDG.\n\nxiii\n\n\f\fTable of Contents\nFront Page . . . .\nAcknowledgments\nAbstract . . . . .\nResumen . . . . .\nList of figures . . .\nList of tables . . .\nAcronyms . . . . .\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nGeneral Introduction\n1 Star Formation in Interactions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1.1 General Concept . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1.2 Star Formation in Violent Environments . . . . . . .\n2 Compact Star-Forming Regions in Galaxy Interactions . .\n2.1 Super Star Clusters and Associations . . . . . . . . .\n2.2 Tidal Dwarf Galaxies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3 (U)LIRGs, Extreme in Star Formation . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.1 Discovery & Characterization of (U)LIRGs . . . . . .\n3.2 Star Formation & Dynamical Processes in (U)LIRGs .\n3.3 Young Compact Star-forming Structures in (U)LIRGs\n3.4 (U)LIRGs in the High-z Universe . . . . . . . . . . .\n4 Thesis Project . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nI\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nSample Selection, Dataset and Data Treatment\n1 Sample Selection and General Properties . . . . . . . . . . .\n1.1 The Sample . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1.2 Morphologies Sampled . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2 Data Acquisition . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.1 Photometric Data: Images from the HST . . . . . . . .\n2.2 Spectroscopic Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.3 Data from numerical Simulations . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3 General Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis Techniques\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\ni\n. vii\n.\nix\n.\nxi\n. xix\n. xxi\n. xxiii\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n1\n1\n1\n2\n5\n5\n12\n17\n18\n22\n23\n24\n26\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n29\n29\n29\n31\n33\n33\n40\n43\n44\nxv\n\n\f3.1\n3.2\n3.3\n3.4\n3.5\n3.6\nII\n\nIII\n\nxvi\n\nDetermination of Sizes . . . . .\nStellar Population Models . . .\nLuminosity and Mass Functions\nRelative HST -IFS Astrometry .\nMetallicity Calibrators . . . . .\nMass Determinations . . . . . .\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nOptically-selected Compact Star-Forming Regions in (U)LIRGs\n1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2 Source Detection and Photometry . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3 Distance Dependence of the Photometric Properties . . . . . . . . . .\n4 General Properties of the Knots . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.1 Magnitudes and Colors.

galaxies and presents the main properties\nof the most extreme star-forming systems in the local Universe,\nupon which the project is based on. It also contains a short description of the formation and dynamical evolution processes of\nthe compact star-forming regions that will be studied throughout this thesis.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nStar Formation in Interactions\nGeneral Concept\n\nA large fraction, if not all, of stars are thought to be born within some type of cluster\nenvironment (e.g., Lada & Lada 2003; Porras et al. 2003). Thus, the formation of star\nclusters is intimately linked to the process of star formation. The use of star clusters\nas a tool to study the (extra)galactic star formation processes is therefore of major\nimportance. The most massive are long lived and therefore potentially carry information\nabout the entire star formation histories of their host galaxies and they are also bright\nenough to be observed at much greater distances than individual stars (Larsen 2010).\nIn the last two decades young, massive, compact clusters have been observed in many\nexternal galaxies and different environments: dwarf galaxies (Billett et al. 2002), spiral disks (Larsen & Richtler 1999), barred galaxies, starburst galaxies (Meurer et al.\n1995; Barth et al. 1995), interacting galaxies (Whitmore et al. 1993, 1999, 2007; Bik\net al. 2003; Weilbacher et al. 2000; Knierman et al. 2003; Peterson et al. 2009) and\ncompact groups of galaxies (Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u00edlchez 2001; Temporin et al. 2003). It\nis commonly assumed that at least some of these are young counterparts of the ancient\nglobular clusters, which are ubiquitous in all major galaxies. However, the link between\n1\n\nSFR\n\nGC\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\nstar formation, the formation of massive clusters and ulterior evolution is not completely\nclear. Much less clear is the understanding of the role played by the environment in\nestablishing this link. This leads us to pose the following questions: How do star clusters\nform? Where do they form more efficiently? Are those clusters formed in very active\nstar-forming systems similar to those formed in less efficient environments? How do they\nevolve, especially when they are formed during major interactions of galaxies? Under\nwhich conditions can they be, if possible, as massive and large as dwarf galaxies?\nAll these questions can be addressed from many directions, from the detailed study of\nindividual star clusters to a more general and statistical study of a sample of thousands\nof clusters. Furthermore, some studies of star cluster populations have shown that young\nstar clusters do not form in isolation, but tend to be clustered themselves (Zhang et al.\n2001; Larsen 2004). Hence, the study of associations of individual clusters can also help\nus understand the star formation occurring in active star-forming systems.\nThe dominant force that governs the cluster formation and all the processes that affect\nthem is gravity. However, the implementation of all the ingredients in the models (e.g.,\ngravity, stellar evolution, binary interactions, the influence of the interestelar medium,\nthe influence of the host galaxy and/or other galaxies in interactions) makes the task\nof simulating the evolution of the host galaxy and its cluster population very complex.\nNevertheless, during the last few years the combination of detailed observations with\nmore realistic models of cluster formation (i.e., via interactions of galaxies), is starting\nto set important constrains on the processes of cluster formation and evolution.\n\n1.2\n\nStar Formation in Violent Environments\n\nClusters tend to form where strong star formation occurs and, especially, in starbursts\ntriggered by violent environments such as galaxy interactions and mergers (Schweizer &\nSeitzer 1998). In the following we will overview the role of this extreme environment.\n\n1.2.1\n\nThe Environment: Interacting Galaxies\n\nDuring the second half of the past century our understanding of galaxy formation and\nevolution, and the role of interactions between galaxies underwent considerable change.\nFrom the initial belief that galaxies were quiescent systems, they passed to be understood as dynamic, evolving entities that could produce cataclysmic interactions. Early\nn-body simulations (Toomre & Toomre 1972) showed how colliding spiral galaxies could\nbe turned into the way seen in the Arp Atlas catalogue (\"Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies\"; Arp\n1966), most of them interacting systems. Toomre (1977) farther suggested that mergers\nmay convert one galaxy type (spiral) into another (elliptical) along the Hubble sequence.\nIn the 90s it was clear that mergers drive galaxy evolution by forming elliptical galaxies\n(e.g., Kormendy & Sanders 1992; Kauffmann & White 1993).\n2\n\n\f1 - Star Formation in Interactions\nMergers not only transform one galaxy type into another but, during their occurrence,\ndrive phenomena that are extraordinary compared to the processes that take place in\nquiescent galaxies. Simulations by Toomre & Toomre (1972) also showed that large\namount of gas would be funneled into the galaxy centers. Shortly after, evidence for\nrecent burst of star formation was reported in the Arp Atlas (Larson & Tinsley 1978),\nwhich was suggested to occur due to galaxy interactions like those described by Toomre.\n\n1.2.2\n\nA Typical Merger. End Product\n\nThe sequential major events in a merger of gas-rich galaxies can be summarized as\nfollows: as the two galaxies approach each other, their stellar disks collide and distort\nand their gas starts flowing toward the center of the system (phase called \"first pericenter\npassage\"). As the distance between the galaxies decreases, the gravitational attraction\nincreases and so does the gas infall toward the center of the merger as a result of dissipation. The stars follow the gas in its infall due to changes in the potential well of the\nmerging system. Due to gravitational torques and tidal forces caused by angular momentum conservation constraints, long tails of stars and gas are formed. The two galaxies\ncontinue to approach one another before they finally merge and reach relaxation. After\nthe nuclei coalesce, the gas infall to the center of the merger decreases and finally stops a\nfew hundreds of Myr later due to outflowing supernova winds related to the ongoing star\nformation and to feedback to the interestellar medium from an active galactic nucleus.\nThe final remnant is supported mainly by random motions instead of systematic rotation.\nThe whole baryoninc matter-merger process usually takes about one Gyr. An example\nof the merger sequence is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe main parameters that determine the end product of such mergers are well understood; the outcome mainly depends upon the initial amount of gas and the mass ratio of\nthe merging spiral galaxies (e.g., Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Mihos & Bothun 1998; Naab\n& Burkert 2003). The gas provides a dissipative component that assists the collapse of\nthe mass to the center of the system by overcoming the angular momentum which tends\nto drive the mass toward the exterior of the system (Hernquist 1993); this way it enables\nthe formation of systems with elliptical-like intensity profiles. The initial mass ratio of\nthe colliding galaxies, connected to the depth of the potential well of the system, is therefore proportional to the amount of gas of the least massive component that inflows to\nthe center of the system. The so-called major mergers \u2013mergers of roughly equal mass,\ntypically 10% of the stellar mass\u2013 lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies (Barnes &\nHernquist 1992a; Naab & Burkert 2003; Bournaud et al. 2005). In contrast, mergers of\ngalaxies with a larger mass ratio (> 4:1), which are called minor, can preserve or even\nenhance the pre-existing angular momentum depending on the orientation of the merging\nsystem (e.g., Mihos & Hernquist 1994b, 1996; Bendo & Barnes 2000).\nThe end product of major mergers at high redshifts spiral galaxies are diverse, since\ntheir disks contain larger amounts of gas (Tacconi et al. 2006). The outcome of high-z\n3\n\nISM\nAGN\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\n\nFigure 1: (a) Sequence of four snapshots showing the merger evolution. Time is indicated\nin Myr after the first pericenter passage.

The result again\ndepends on the amount of gas in the initial galaxies and on the presence of a bulge (it\ndelays the star formation events) and an AGN (it suppresses the star formation events,\nproducing a negative feedback ).\n\n1.2.3\n\nStar Formation Bursts in Mergers\n\nWhile the picture we have for the end product of gas-rich mergers is well understood,\nthat for the intermediate merger phases (i.e., between first pericenter passage and final relaxation) is rather unclear. The uncertainties mainly originate from the simplified\ntreatment of the ISM (i.e., the gas and the dust). The role played by interactions and\nmergers in enhancing star formation has also been subject of intense debate in the past\nfew decades by means of numerical simulations (e.g., Barnes & Hernquist 1992a; Mihos\n4\n\n\f2 - Compact Star-Forming Regions in Galaxy Interactions\n& Hernquist 1994b; Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Springel 2000; Barnes 2004; Springel et al.\n2005; Bournaud & Duc 2006; Cox et al. 2006; Di Matteo et al. 2007; Di Matteo et al.\n2008; Teyssier et al. 2010). Although it has become clear that the star formation efficiency is highly dependent upon the numerical recipe adopted for star formation (density\nor shock dependent) and feedback assumptions, all the studies have supported the fact\nthat galaxy interactions induce star formation.\nIt is not well understood either at what point in time the gas infall to the center\nof the merger is maximum and hence, it is unclear at what point the strongest star\nformation or starburst events occur. Statistically, it is thought that the SFR peaks\nroughly between the first encounter and shortly after the nuclear coalescence (Mihos &\nHernquist 1996; Springel et al. 2005; Di Matteo et al. 2008). The result mainly depends\non the size of the galaxy bulges (large bulges stabilize the gas and delay its fall to the\ncenter of the system), the presence of a black hole (it acts as a strong gravitational point\nat the center of the system), and the strength of the winds from the supernovae and the\nAGN (they produce a negative feedback).\n\n2\n\nCompact Star-Forming Regions in Galaxy Interactions\n\n2.1\n\nSuper Star Clusters and Associations\n\nAmong the diverse consequences of the violent processes that galaxy encounters undergo, the enhancement of the star formation in some epochs of the interaction leads to\nthe formation of large number of star clusters. Most intriguingly was the discovery of a\nnew class of young and massive (as globular clusters) star clusters, very much common\nin this environment of galaxy mergers.\n\n2.1.1\n\nDiscovery and Characterization of Super Star Clusters\n\nWe commonly accept that our Galaxy is \"normal\" and a good representative of spiral\ngalaxies. The Milky Way has two distinct populations of star clusters, open and globular\nclusters (GCs). The open clusters are typically young (a few Myr - a few Gyr), low mass\n(M < 5\u00d7104 M\u2299 ), and low density objects (\u03c1 \u223c 20 M\u2299 /pc3 in the central regions),\nand are clearly associated with the galactic disk. GCs, on the other hand, are all old\n(\u03c4 > 10 Gyr), high mass (M = 104 -106 M\u2299 ) and high density objects (\u03c1 \u223c400 M\u2299 /pc3 ),\nassociated with the Galactic bulge/halo.\nThe mass functions of open and globular clusters are also strikingly different. The\nMF of young open clusters can be fitted by a power law, dN/dM \u221d M\u22122 , down to\na few hundred M\u2299 (Elmegreen & Efremov 1997; Piskunov et al. 2008). In contrast, the globular cluster MF is rather flat at low masses (dN/dM \u221d constant for\n5\n\nMF\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\nM < 105 M\u2299 ; McLaughlin & Pudritz 1996), whereas the high-mass end can be fitted\nby a power law with slope of -2, as for the open clusters. Given the clear dichotomy\nbetween these two systems, traditionally it has been established that open and globular\nclusters formed by two separate mechanisms.\n\nYMC\nSSC\n\nHowever, for the past few decades a significant population of extragalactic massive\n(M > 5\u00d7104 M\u2299 ) young (\u03c4 < 1 Gyr) clusters has been detected in many environments:\nin the LMC (Elson & Fall 1985), in normal spirals (e.g., Larsen 2000; Larsen 2004, in\nstarburst galaxies (e.g., in M82; O'Connell et al. 1995; de Grijs et al. 2005), in ongoing\nmergers (e.g., in The Antennae; Whitmore et al. 1999) and in merger remnants (e.g., in\nNGC 7252; Schweizer & Seitzer 1998; Maraston et al. 2001). Nowadays, these objects\nare known as young massive clusters or super star clusters.\nThe HST caused a revolution in the field of extragalactic clusters. Its high angular\nresolution first allowed to establish an upper limit to the size on young extragalactic\nclusters. Shortly after, with improved optics, the WFPC2 camera on board HST was\nable to resolve individual star clusters in external galaxies, showing that they did indeed\nhave sizes (1-20 pc) comparable to globular clusters in our Galaxy (e.g., Whitmore et al.\n1999).\nThe first environments that were discovered to contain copious amounts of massive\nstar clusters were those of galaxy mergers. Holtzman et al. (1992) were the first in a long\nlist of studies which used the HST to discover massive young clusters in mergers. They\nstudied a recent galaxy merger (NGC 1275), and found a population of blue point-like\nsources, with ages of less than 300 Myr old and masses between 105 -108 M\u2299. These young\nmassive clusters were also found in the prototypical merger remnant NGC 7252, with ages\nranging from 34 to 500 Myr, consistent with having been formed during the interaction\nprocess (Whitmore et al. 1993). Many more examples soon followed, like those in NGC\n3597 (Holtzman et al. 1996), in NGC 3921 (Schweizer et al. 1996), in NGC 3256 (Zepf\net al. 1999), in NGC 4038/4039 (Whitmore et al. 1993, 1995, 1999, 2010; Bastian et al.\n2006), in M51 (Bastian et al. 2005a, 2005b) and in Arp284 (Peterson et al. 2009), among\nothers. An example of many SSCs candidates found in The Antennae, the youngest and\nnearest example of a pair of merging disk galaxies in the Toomre (1977) sequence, is\nshown in Fig. 2.\nThe SSCs found in these systems have many of the same properties as the galactic\nglobular clusters, namely size and mass (and hence stellar density). On the other hand,\ntheir ages, metallicities, and mass functions are much more similar to those in galactic\nopen clusters. This mixture of properties led to their designation as young globular\nclusters, implying that they are the same as the old globular clusters in our Galaxy\n(only younger) and that any differences between these populations are simply due to\nevolutionary effects.\n\n6\n\n\f2 - Compact Star-Forming Regions in Galaxy Interactions\n\nFigure 2: The main bodies of The Antennae viewed with the Advanced Camera for Surveys\n(ACS/HST ).

(2010).\n\n7\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\n2.1.2\n\nGMC\n\nFormation of SSCs\n\nThe problem of cluster formation is intimately linked to that of star formation. Star\nformation is closely associated with dense molecular gas and proto-clusters are observed\nto form deeply embedded within giant molecular clouds. The GMCs are themselves\npart of a larger hierarchy of structure in the interstellar medium (Elmegreen & Falgarone 1996; Elmegreen 2007), and tend to be organized into giant molecular complexes\n(Wilson et al. 2003). The average particle density of molecular gas in a GMC is low\n(nH \u223c102 -103 cm\u22123 ), but stars only form in the densest regions (i.e., nH > 105 cm\u22123 ).\nTherefore, in general star formation is an inefficient process and only a few percent of\nthe mass of a given GMC is converted into stars before the cloud is dispersed.\nThe GMC mass function in the Milky Way has a characteristic upper-mass of about\n6\u00d7106 M\u2299 and the mass spectrum of clumps within GMCs appears to follow a similar\npower law as that of the GMCs, dN/dM \u221d M\u03b1 , with \u03b1 \u223c -2 (Mac Low & Klessen 2004).\nFrom there an upper-limit to a cluster mass of few 105 M\u2299 is derived, consistent with\nother constraints on the initial cluster mass function in spiral galaxies (Larsen 2009).\nIt is hard to understand how the most massive clusters observed in some external\ngalaxies, with masses of 106 M\u2299 or higher, could form from Milky Way-like GMCs .\nIn order for a GMC to reach the average mean density required to form a massive\ncluster (i.e., nH >105 cm\u22123 ), it should collect the amount of gas typical of a massive\nGalactic GMC within a volume only a few pc across, essentially turning such a cloud\ninto one big clump (Larsen 2010). Such high dense and massive clumps exist in starbursts\nand interacting galaxies, which may allow denser and more massive GMCs to condense\n(Escala & Larson 2008). The presence of shocks and compressive tides in mergers also\nhelp these massive GMCs condense (Ashman & Zepf 2001; Renaud et al. 2008, 2009).\nIn even more extreme environments, such as in (U)LIRGs (see Section 3), GMCs may\nbe both denser and more massive (Murray et al. 2010), consistent with the presence of\nclusters with M > 107 M\u2299 in some merger remnants (W3 in NGC 7252; Maraston et al.\n2004; Bastian et al. 2006).\n\n2.1.3\n\nDynamical Evolution of SSCs\n\nAll clusters undergo at birth an embedded phase in the progenitor molecular cloud\nthat lasts at least a few Myr (i.e., \u03c4 . 3 Myr), with high gas column densities and\nrelatively large amounts of dust extinction of AV \u223c 1-8 mag (Larsen 2009). Stellar winds,\nionizing flux from massive stars, and stellar feedback expel the remaining gas eventually\n(see Goodwin 2009 for a recent review). If all stars are formed in clusters, then only a\nsmall percentage remain still within clusters at the end of the embedded phase (Lada &\nLada 2003, 2010). In fact, while expelling the gas many clusters become unbound and\nsubsequently disperse into the surrounding medium.\n8\n\n\f2 - Compact Star-Forming Regions in Galaxy Interactions\nAn embedded cluster will not necessarily remain bound after gas expulsion (Lada\net al. 2010). If the stars and gas are initially in virial equilibrium, the velocity dispersion\nof the stars will be too high to match the shallower potential once the gas is expelled. In\npractise, cluster expansion and gas expulsion does not occur instantly so the stars have\nsome time to adjust to the new potential. Simulations suggest that a small fraction of\nthe stars may remain bound for star formation efficienciesa of less than 20-30% (Boily\n& Kroupa 2003; Baumgardt & Kroupa 2007). This process, known as 'infant mortality'\nor 'mass-independent disruption mechanism' can last for several tens of Myr until the\ncluster settles into a new equilibrium (Goodwin & Bastian 2006; Whitmore et al. 2007).\nThis picture is consistent with observations. Lada & Lada (2003) estimated that about\n95% of clusters formed in the Milky Way dissolve in less than 100 Myr. Although the\nuniversality of this process is poorly quantified, some efforts have been made by observing\nthe cluster demographics in extragalactic clusters, especially in interacting galaxies. For\ninstance, the age distribution of mass-limited cluster samples in The Antennae galaxies,\nthe well-known archetype of a major merger, is approximately dN/d\u03c4 \u22cd \u03c4 \u22121 for ages (\u03c4 )\nof up to 108 -109 yr (Fall et al. 2005), suggesting that 80-90% of the clusters disappear\nper decade in age, independent of mass (Whitmore et al. 2007). However, over such a\nlarge age range, it is unlikely that disruption can still be attributed to gas expulsion.\nDuring the last few years the has been a controversy about this issue, since estimating disruption parameters for interacting systems is not straightforward. Bastian et al.\n(2009) fitted the age distribution of clusters in The Antennae with a model in which the\ncluster formation rate has increased over the past few hundreds of Myr (Mihos et al.\n1993), as suggested by simulations of the ongoing interaction (e.g., Cox et al. 2008). In\nthis model the mass-independent disruption mechanism only lasts for . 20 Myr. A high\ndisruption fraction (\u223c 70%) was also claimed in M51 (Bastian et al. 2005b), but this\ncan be partly due to age-dating artifacts around 10 Myr (Gieles 2009a).\nClusters that survive the infant mortality process will continue to evolve dynamically\non longer timescales as a result of internal two-body relaxation, external shocks and mass\nloss due to stellar evolution (Vesperini 2010). This evolution (known as 'secular evolution') will lead to the gradual evaporation of any star cluster and, eventually, its total\ndissolution on timescales dependent on the mass of the cluster (Spitzer 1987; Baumgardt\n& Makino 2003). Two-body relaxation causes the velocities of the stars in the cluster to\napproach a Maxwellian distribution, and stars with velocities above the escape velocity\nwill gradually evaporate from the cluster. Shocks may be due to encounters with spiral\narms, GMCs or, for GCs on eccentric orbits, passages through the galactic disc or near\nthe bulge. Finally, stellar evolution causes mass loss as stars are turned into much less\nmassive remnants. Over a 10 Gyr time span, about one third of the initial cluster stellar\nmass is lost this way (e.g., Bruzual & Charlot 2003).\ncl\nSFE = MclM\n+Mgas , where Mcl is the total mass of stars formed in the embedded cluster and Mgas is\nthe mass of the gas not converted into stars\n\na\n\n9\n\nSFE\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\n\nFigure 3: Left: Mass functions for young (\u03c4 <200 Myr) clusters in spiral galaxies (Larsen\n2009 and The Antennae (Whitmore et al. 1999). Center and right: Luminosity functions of\nclusters in M51 (center) and The Antennae galaxies (right). Also shown are modeled LFs assuming Schechter initial cluster MFs with Mc = 2\u00d7105 and 2\u00d7106 M\u2299 (solid and dashed lines,\nrespectively), scaled to match the data. Figure taken from Larsen (2010).\n\n2.1.4\n\nICMF\n\nCluster Mass and Luminosity Functions\n\nThe basic stellar dynamical mechanisms responsible for the evolution of the MF are\nthe same for all clusters, although the importance of one mechanism or another (i.e.,\ntwo-body relaxation vs. shocks) differs. However, the initial cluster mass function on\nwhich these mechanisms operate might still vary with environment. Nowadays, there are\nauthors who support these dependent mechanisms (e.g., Larsen 2009) and others who\nclaim that the physical processes responsible for the formation of the clusters are the\nsame, thus the ICMF is universal (e.g., Whitmore et al. 2007; Fall et al. 2009).\nDeterminations of the MF are only available for a few young cluster systems. Generally, they are well-represented by power laws, dN/dM \u221d M\u2212\u03b1 , with slopes of \u03b1 \u223c 2,\nalthough the mass ranges over which these slopes are derived vary considerably (from\nfew \u00d7 103 to few \u00d7 106 M\u2299 ; Gieles et al. 2006; Larsen 2009). However, when comparing\nthe MFs of young massive star clusters (i.e., M > 105 M\u2299 and \u03c4 <200 Myr) in spirals\nand more active star-forming galaxies (like The Antennae), small differences may show\nup (see Fig. 3, left). Although a uniform power law with no truncation is consistent with\nthe data, a fit using a Schechter (1976) function may be also possible,\ndN\n\u221d\ndM\n\n\u0012\n\nM\nMc\n\n\u0013\u2212\u03b1\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nM\nexp \u2212\nMc\n\n(1)\n\nThis function usually fits well the high-mass end of the MF in old GCs systems. A fit to the spiral data in Fig. 3 for a fixed \u03b1 = 2 yields a truncation\nmass Mc = (2.1 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 105 M\u2299 (Larsen 2009). A fit to The Antennae data gives\nMc = (1.7 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7106 M\u2299 (Jord\u00e1n et al. 2007; Larsen 2009; Gieles 2009a), although\n10\n\n\f2 - Compact Star-Forming Regions in Galaxy Interactions\na uniform power law with no truncation is also consistent with the data (Whitmore et al.\n2007). This suggests a lack of high-mass clusters in spirals (i.e., a different ICMF ),\ncompared to the more-active star-forming systems, like The Antennae. Whitmore et al.\n(2007) attributes the existence of such high mass clusters in The Antennae system to a\nsize-of-sample effect (statistical effect) rather than a difference in the physical process\nresponsible for the formation of the clusters: active mergers have the brightest and most\nmassive young clusters only because they contain more clusters.\nOnce observational selection effects are accounted for, it is relatively straightforward\nto derive the luminosity function of a cluster sample, assuming the distance is known.\nHowever, the interpretation of the LF in terms of the physically more fundamental MF is\ncomplicated by the fact that not all clusters have the same age and therefore mass-to-light\nratio.\nIf no disruption is present and the MF is a uniform power law, \u03c8(M)dM \u221d M\u2212\u03b1 dM,\nand then the LF is a power law with the same slope (\u03c8(L)dL \u221d L\u2212\u03b2 dL, with \u03b1 = \u03b2).\nHowever, the shape of the LF can differ from that of the underlying MF because of\ndisruption and the age-dependent mass-to-light ratio.\nAgain, the same opposite views outlined at the beginning of the section are currently\nbeing extensively discussed:\n(i) For Schechter-like ICMFs (i.e., it depends on the environment), the LF is not expected to be a single power law (Gieles 2010). An example of possible different fits\nto the LF using the Schechter function is shown in the central and right panels in\nFig. 3. The LFs of clusters in M51 (Haas et al. 2008) and The Antennae system\n(Whitmore et al. 1999) are compared with modeled LFs for Schechter ICMFs with\ndifferent truncation mass, same disruption processes and assuming a constant SFR.\nIt is clear that the Mc = 2\u00d7105 M\u2299 modeled LF matches the M51 data quite well,\nwhile the Mc = 2\u00d7106 M\u2299 LF is too shallow at the bright end. For The Antennae,\nhowever, the Mc = 2\u00d7106 M\u2299 LF provides a better fit. The different mass truncation suggests that the MF in both systems are different, that in M51 being more\nsimilar to that in non-interacting spirals.\n(ii) There is no change in the ICMF because it is universal (Whitmore et al. 2007; Fall\net al. 2009). The turnovers observed in the MFs and LFs in other studies are\nunderstood as selection effects. For instance, Anders et al. (2007) re-analyses the\nWFPC2 data from Whitmore et al. (1999) on observations of The Antennae and\nfound a truncation of the LF at MV \u2243 -8.5. However, Whitmore et al. (2010) argue\nthat the turnover appears to be caused by the introduction of a selection criterion\nthat requires objects to have a U -band photometric uncertainty of \u03c3U \u2264 0.2 mag.\nThey do not observe that truncation on either the MF or the LF in the latest survey\nof clusters in The Antennae down to magnitudes of MV \u2243 -6, which is at the same\ntime consistent with relaxation-driven cluster disruption models that predict the\nturnover should not be observed until MV \u2243 -4 (Fall & Zhang 2001).\n11\n\nLF\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\n2.1.5\n\nStar-forming Complexes\n\nNormally, clusters do not form in isolation but tend to be clustered themselves (Zhang\net al. 2001; Larsen 2004). Star-forming complexes represent the largest units of star\nformation in a galaxy (see the review by Efremov 1995). They are typically kpc-scale\nregions encompassing several clusters, probably originated from the same parent giant\nmolecular cloud.\nAn interesting question is how the MF of GMCs is related to that of the clusters\nforming within them. The GMC mass function in the MilkyWay can be approximated by\na power law, dN \u221d dM/M\u2212\u03b1 , with \u03b1 = 1.6-1.8 (Williams & McKee 1997). The ICMF is\nunlikely to be a simple scaled-down version of the GMC MF , since a single GMC may\nform more than one cluster (e.g.\u201e Kumar et al. 2004). The mass spectrum of clumps\nwithin GMCs seems to be somewhat steeper, with \u03b1 \u22cd 2 (Mac Low & Klessen 2004),\nsimilar to that measured for individual star clusters.\nStar-forming complexes have also been observed in some nearby interacting galaxies,\nsuch as in M51 (Bastian et al. 2005a) and in NGC 4038/4039 (Whitmore et al. 1999),\nwith the aim of understanding the hierarchy of the star formation in embedded groupings.\nThese works have confirmed that their properties resemble those of GMCs from which\n2\nthey are formed. In particular, the mass-radius relation, namely MGMC \u221d RGMC\n, reflects\nthe original state of virial equilibrium in these clouds (Solomon et al. 1987) and holds\ndown to the scale of cloud clumps with a few parsecs in radius (Williams et al. 1995).\nComplexes of young clusters in M51 have a similar correlation, showing the imprint\nfrom the parent GMC (Bastian et al. 2005a). Likewise, YMCs with masses above\n106 M\u2299 follow the relation (Kissler-Patig et al. 2006). However, young clusters with\nlower mass do not (Larsen 2004; Bastian et al. 2005b; Kissler-Patig et al. 2006). A\nstar formation efficiency that depends on the binding energy (predicted by Elmegreen &\nEfremov 1997) of the progenitor GMC could destroy such a relation during the formation\nof young clusters. Another possible explanation for this lack of a mass-radius relation in\nyoung clusters is that dynamical encounters between young clusters (and gas clouds) add\nenergy into the forming clusters, thereby increasing their radii (Bastian et al. 2005a).\n\n2.2\n\nTDG\n\nTidal Dwarf Galaxies\n\nAs a result of the enhancement of the star formation in galaxy mergers, SSCs are\nprobably not the ultimate bound structures that can be created during the interaction.\nCondensations of large amounts of gas along the tidal tails and at the tips have been\nobserved for the past few decades. In such condensations objects as massive and as large\nas the most extreme cases of SSCs and even more massive and larger, within the range\nof the dwarf galaxy population, can be formed. Some of these structures can be bound\nand long-lived. They are widely known as tidal dwarf galaxies.\n12\n\n\f2 - Compact Star-Forming Regions in Galaxy Interactions\n2.2.1\n\nDiscovery & Characterization of TDGs\n\nThe scenario of low mass (i.e., dwarf) galaxy formation during giant galaxy collisions\nwas first proposed by Zwicky (1956), though without strong observational evidence. During the following two decades the concept that galaxies were static entities was being\ndiverted into an opposite direction. They started to be understood as dynamic, evolving\nobjects with a high possibility of close encounters that radically change their morphology\n(see Section 1.2).\nThe first thorough analysis of an apparent dwarf galaxy built in a tidal tail was\npresented by Schweizer (1978). He noted the young age of the stars in an area at the\ntip of the southern tail of The Antennae system and their higher than expected metal\ncontent for a location at such large radii. Questions about stable dwarf galaxies forming\nat this location arose.\nSome years later, Mirabel et al. (1991,1992) went on with the investigation of this\nspecific mode of galaxy formation by claiming to have found at least one dwarf galaxy\nin the long tails of The Superantennae merger (AM 1925-724). Hernquist (1992a) noted\nthe possibility that more dwarf galaxies could be formed during the collisions of larger\ngalaxies.\nThe first numerical simulations of the dynamics of interacting galaxies with the aim\nof studying the formation of TDGs were carried out by Barnes & Hernquist (1992b) and\nElmegreen et al. (1993), who showed that the formation of dwarf galaxies as a result of\na major interaction is possible. Barnes & Hernquist (1992b) also noted that TDGs are\nnot likely to contain a large amount of dark matter, contrary to normal dwarf galaxies\n(in particular, dwarf spheroidals), because their material is drawn from the spiral disk\nwhile the dark matter is thought to surround the galaxy in an extended halo.\nMotivated by the theoretical prediction of these models and in order to study the\nnature of these kind of objects, several campaigns were launched in interacting systems,\nsuch as in NGC 2782 (Yoshida et al. 1994), Arp 105 (Duc & Mirabel 1994; Duc et al.\n1997), NGC 7252 (Hibbard et al. 1994), NGC 5291 (Duc & Mirabel 1998; Higdon et al.\n2006), Arp 245 (Duc et al. 2000), small samples (Weilbacher et al. 2000, 2003; Knierman\net al. 2003; Monreal-Ibero et al. 2007) and Arp 305 (Hancock et al. 2009). Hibbard\n& Mihos (1995) also developed a successful dynamical N-body model of NGC 7252 (see\nFig. 4). According to that model, most of the tidal material will remain bound to the\ncentral merger, but a significant amount of matter will not fall back within a Hubble time.\nIt is expected that the two TDG candidates in NGC 7252 \u2013if they remain stable entities\u2013\nwill attain long-lived orbits around the merger. Some other investigations have tried to\nfind TDGs in the specific environment of compact galaxy groups (e.g., Hunsberger et al.\n1996; Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u00edlchez 2001; Temporin et al. 2003; Nishiura et al. 2002).\nBased on these observations, TDG candidates are characterized by a luminosity higher\nthan B = -10.65, typically B = -13, and can be as luminous as B = -19. Their color is\n13\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\n\nFigure 4: Top: The CTIO 4m B-band image of NGC 7252 from Hibbard et al.

The presence of young\npopulation is firmly proved with the detection of strong H\u03b1 emission with and equivalent\nwidth higher than tens of \u00c5. The half-light radius of these kpc-sized structures ranges\nfrom few hundreds of pc to less than 2 kpc, comparable to that in observed dwarf galaxies\nin different galaxy groups and to the so-called Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies.\nAll spectroscopic observations of TDGs have showed that the luminosity-metallicity\ncorrelation found for normal dwarf galaxies does not hold up for TDGs. While dwarf\ngalaxies have lower oxygen abundances for lower luminosities, TDGs have an approximately constant metallicity of around one-third of the solar value as determined from\ngaseous emission lines (see e.g., Duc et al. 2000; Weilbacher et al. 2003). On this basis,\nHunter et al. (2000) confirmed the metallicity of TDGs as one of the best criteria to\nfind old dwarf galaxies in merger remnants. Supplementing this criterion with estimates\nabout rotational properties and stellar populations, they also presented a list of nearby\ndwarf irregulars which might be good candidates for old TDGs.\nFor normal galaxies is easy to know if they are real galaxies and if they will survive\nlong enough to deserve being called galaxies. Most galaxies are very isolated, without\nmuch matter nearby to disturb their stability. Some starburst galaxies may lose much\nof their gas by strong stellar winds and supernova driven outflows, but in most cases\nthere is no doubt that the stellar component will remain bound and stable, even without\ngas, for several billion years. The same is true for normal dwarf galaxies in less dense\nenvironments.\nBut is not straightforward the identification of the observed TDG candidates as real\ngalaxies. They are embedded in a tidal tail and, most probably, do not have massive\ndark matter halos (Barnes & Hernquist 1992b; Braine et al. 2001; Wetzstein et al. 2007.\nTidal forces of the parent galaxy disturb their gravitational field, strong star formation\nmight blow away the recently accreted gas, and some of the TDGs may even fall back\ninto the central merger (Hibbard & Mihos 1995). An accepted definition that tries to\nensure that only those objects which, called Tidal Dwarf Galaxies, deserve to be named\n\"galaxy\" is: A Tidal Dwarf Galaxy is a self-gravitating entity of dwarf-galaxy mass built\nfrom the tidal material expelled during interactions (Duc et al. 2000; Weilbacher &\nFritze-v. Alvensleben 2001).\nTaking into account evaporation and fragmentation processes plus tidal disruption,\nDuc et al. (2004) suggested that a total mass as high as 109 M\u2299 may be necessary\nfor a new formed TDG to become a long-lived object. This is the typical mass of the\ngiant HI accumulations observed near the tip of several long tidal tails. Less massive\ncondensations may evolve, if they survive, into objects more similar to globular clusters.\nHowever this mass criterion is not well established, and less massive objects (a total mass\nof few 107 -few 109 M\u2299 ) have been normally considered as TDG candidates (Duc et al.\n2007, Sheen et al. 2009, Hancock et al. 2009).\n\n15\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\n2.2.2\n\nFormation Scenario for TDGs\n\nFrom the observational evidence and especially from the theoretical modeling of\nTDGs presented in the previous section, the formation sequence of Tidal Dwarf Galaxies\ncan be summarized as follows:\nAn interaction occurs between two or more galaxies, of which at least one has to be\na disk galaxy so that the interaction is able to produce tidal tails. One or more stellar\nor gaseous condensations appear within the tails, born from gravitational instabilities.\nIf massive enough, the gravitational potential of these condensations will attract the\nsurrounding matter. When a condensation has condensed enough, the neutral gas will\nbe transformed into molecular gas and star formation can start on top of a possible\nold stellar population. If this proto dwarf galaxy withstands the gravitational forces of\nthe surrounding matter and the supernova explosions in the course of its star formation\nepisode, and does not fall back into the parent galaxy, it will survive as an independent\ndwarf galaxy as soon as the remaining matter in the tidal features falls back onto the\nremnant or thins out and disappears. Now, not all self-gravitating structures in tidal\ntails have the required initial mass to form a genuine galaxy.\nParallel to this top-down scenario, Kroupa (1998) has suggested a bottom-up scenario\nof formation of SSCs , leading to the formation of spheroidal dwarf-type objects, like\nTDGs. Kroupa studied a collisionless simulation of a SSC without gas. After the formation of a central SSC within a few tens of Myr, individual clusters continue to merge\nwith the growing central system. Kroupa (1998) estimated between 40 and 60% the\nfraction of merged SSCs that survive for 95 Myr and predicted that surviving spheroidal\ndwarf-type objects should exist and orbit around the main body. If the dwarf galaxy\nformed in the inner parts of a tidal arm, it could be ejected later on an eccentric orbit\nwith a semi-major axis of tens of kpc. Even if the SSC model that Kroupa focused on\nis gas poor (gas and dust are expelled from compact star clusters with radius of 10 pc\nin only about 0.1 Myr), he raised the possibility that the formation of massive SSC may\nalso be a mode of star formation in the outer regions of gas-rich tidal tails. If rich groups\nof globular clusters form in the SSC, bound spheroidal dwarf galaxies may remain after\ngas expulsion. Bastian et al. (2005a) provide observational evidence that support the\nformation of massive SSCs in M51 within this scenario.\n\n2.2.3\n\nCosmological Implications of TDG Formation\n\nThe origin and properties of the satellites surrounding massive galaxies has recently\nbeen the subject of an active debate, triggered by its cosmological implications. In fact,\na complete picture for the origin of dwarf galaxies is still missing. Generally speaking,\na dwarf galaxy can be formed from either collapse of primordial gas cloud in the framework of cosmology (i.e., classical dwarf), or materials driven by tidal force away from\nmassive galaxies in interactions and mergers (TDG). The classical dwarf galaxies are\n16\n\n\f3 - (U)LIRGs, Extreme in Star Formation\ncharacterized by small size and dominated by a dark matter halo (Aaronson 1983; Simon\n& Geha 2007; Geha et al. 2009). They are metal poor because of inefficient chemical\nenrichment in shallow gravitational potential which keeps little metal against supernova\nwinds (Tremonti et al. 2004), and thus sensitive for testing physical mechanisms driving\ngalaxy evolution (e.g. supernova feedback). The cosmologically-originated dwarf galaxies\ngive rise to a well-known challenge to the theory of galaxy formation (i.e., the \"missing\nsatellites problem\"; Klypin et al. 1999) since, although the number of known satellites\nkeeps increasing with time (e.g., Belokurov et al. 2007), it is still lower than the number\nof primordial satellites predicted by standard cosmological hierarchical scenarios.\nThe situation could even be worse, as claimed by Bournaud & Duc (2006), who pointed\nout that the cosmological models do not take into account the fact that second-generation\n(or recycled) galaxies may be formed during collisions. As mentioned in previous sections,\nTDG galaxies are believed to contain no dark matter halo and be metal rich. They\noften have episodic star formation historie (Weisz et al. 2008) compared to the constant\nSFH for classical dwarfs (Marconi et al. 1995; Tolstoy et al. 2009). Understanding the\ncontribution of TDGs to the local dwarf population is therefore an important issue in\ndwarf galaxy astrophysics. According to the hierarchical scenario, massive galaxies were\ngradually assembled through a number of merger events (Eisenstein et al. 2005, and\nreferences therein), providing potential space for numerous TDGs produced over cosmic\ntime. However, TDGs are exclusively associated with tidal tails driven by rotationsupport systems. They are also affected by the tidal friction with their parent galaxies.\nIt is likely that only a small fraction of TDGs are able to live longer than 10 Gyr,\ndepending on their mass and distance to the parent galaxies.\nAn early study by Okazaki & Taniguchi (2000) showed that TDGs can contribute\nsignificantly to the total population of dwarf satellites in addition to primordial dwarfs,\neven that the overall dwarf population could be of tidal origin. However, it has been\nrecently claimed that only a marginal fraction (less than 10%) of dwarf galaxies in the\nlocal universe could actually be of tidal origin (Bournaud & Duc 2006; Wen et al. 2011).\nThe issue is still controversial. Additionally, it is difficult to identify TDGs once the\ntidal tail fades away. Only a few works have found TDG candidates with an important\nfraction of old population in post-merger galaxies (Duc et al. 2007; Sheen et al. 2009).\n\n3\n\n(U)LIRGs, Extreme in Star Formation\n\nAs outlined in previous sections, the observation of galactic mergers offers a special opportunity for learning more about the star formation in general and, specifically,\nthe star cluster formation process. Interacting galaxies were common in the early Universe but they also continue today, producing the strongest known starbursts (Sanders\n& Mirabel 1996). In some systems, the extreme burst of star formation is hidden by\nlarge amounts of dust and its energy output re-emitted at longer wavelengths (i.e., the\n17\n\nSFHs\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\n\nTable 1: Acronyms and definitions used by the IRAS catalog\n\nFFIR\n1.26 \u00d7 10\u221214 * (2.58f60 + f100 )[Wm\u22122 ]\nLFIR\nL(40-500\u03bcm) = 4\u03c0DL2 CFFIR [L\u2299 ]\nFIR\n1.8 \u00d7 10\u221214 * (13.48f12 + 5.16f25 + 2.58f60 + f100 )[W\u22122 ]\nLIR\nL(8-1000\u03bcm) = 4\u03c0DL2 FIR [L\u2299 ]\nLIRG\nLuminous IR Galaxy, LIR > 1011 L\u2299\nULIRG\nUltra-Luminous IR Galaxy, LIR > 1012 L\u2299\nHyLIRG Hyper-Luminous IR Galaxy, LIR > 1013 L\u2299\nNotes.

DL corresponds to\nthe luminosity distance. Table adapted from Sanders & Mirabel 1996.\n\nIR\nLIRG\nULIRG\n\ninfraredb ). These systems, known as Luminous and Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies,\ndeserve special consideration in this context.\n\n3.1\nIRAS\n\nDiscovery & Characterization of (U)LIRGs\n\nThe launch of the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite (Neugebauer et al. 1984) caused a\nrevolution for the infrared astronomy, since it increased the number of catalogued sources\nby about 70%. It took images in four bands centered at 12, 25, 60 and 100 \u03bcm, and\ndetected many extragalactic sources with an emission in the IR higher than in any other\nspectral range.\nOwing to the discovery of such luminous extragalactic objects in the IR , the definition of Luminous and Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies was made. LIRGs and\nULIRGs are objects with infrared luminosities of 1011 L\u2299 \u2264 Lbol \u223c LIR < 1012 L\u2299 and\n1012 L\u2299 \u2264 LIR c < 1013 L\u2299 , respectively (Sanders & Mirabel 1996). This classification is\nbased on the definitions in Table 1. Although they comprise the dominant population\nof extragalactic objects at Lbol > 1011 L\u2299 and are even twice as numerous as optically\ndetected QSOs with same bolometric luminosity (see Fig. 5, left), they are relatively rare\nin the local Universe (Soifer et al. 1987, 1989). In fact, their space density is several\norders of magnitude lower than that of the normal galaxies.\nThanks to observations with Spitzer (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005; Le Floc'h et al.\nb\n\nThe IR spectral range covers from about 0.75 \u03bcm to 350 \u03bcm, and it is normally divided into three\nregions: the near-IR (from 0.75 to 5 \u03bcm), the mid-IR (from 5 to 25 \u03bcm), and the far-IR (from 25 to\n350\u03bcm) (Glass 1999).\nc\nFor simplicity, we will identify the infrared luminosity as LIR (L\u2299 ) \u2261 log (LIR ) .\n\n18\n\n\f3 - (U)LIRGs, Extreme in Star Formation\n\nFigure 5: Left: The luminosity function for infrared galaxies compared with other extragalactic sources. Figure taken from Sanders et al. (1996). Right: Optical spectroscopic classification\nof starburst galaxies and (U)LIRGs as a function of the infrared luminosity. Figure taken from\nVeilleux et al. (1995).\n\n2005) it is known that most of the galaxies selected at high-z are (U)LIRGs and they are\nmajor contributors to the star formation rate density at z \u223c 1-2.\nThe only way to explain these high infrared luminosities in (U)LIRGs is the absorption\nby dust of the available energy (photons) at shorter wavelengths and ulterior re-emission\nin the infrared. Since the first detections of IR-bright galaxies, the nature of the dominant power source in (U)LIRGs has been one of the key questions and much effort has\nbeen devoted to resolving it. Today it is widely accepted that their main energy source\ncorresponds to strong starburst activity, possibly triggered by a major merger (Genzel\net al. 1998b). However, an AGN may also be present, and even be the dominant energy\nsource in a small percentage of the most luminous systems (Genzel et al. 1998a; Farrah\net al. 2003). As the infrared luminosity increases the presence of a heavily obscured\nAGN is more likely (Kim et al. 1995; Goldader et al. 1997; Yuan et al. 2010).\nSince (U)LIRGs are objects affected by the presence of large amounts of dust, extinction measurements are usually very high and patchy, up to AV \u223c 10 mag or even higher\ndepending on the observation (Lonsdale et al. 2006; Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006).\nLINER-like ionization has also been detected in this kind of systems and is thought\nto come out for the presence of galactic super-winds produced by strong starbursts or\ngalaxy merging processes (Heckman et al. 1990; McDowell et al. 2003; Colina et al.\n19\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\n2004; Monreal-Ibero et al. 2010).\n\nFigure 6: True-color images of some local LIRGs taken with the NOT (Nordic Optical Telescope) from a sample of local LIRGs. Figure taken from Arribas et al. (2004).\n\nMost local LIRGs show the typical morphology of a spiral or a system undergoing an\nearly stage of interaction, with the presence of star-forming regions and often tails with\ndust (Surace et al. 2000; Scoville et al. 2000; Alonso-Herrero et al. 2002, 2006, 2009; Arribas et al. 2004; Rodr\u00edguez-Zaur\u00edn et al. 2011). Yet, an important fraction (at least\n25%) presents a perturbed morphology or is clearly involved in an interaction process.\nA few examples of the morphology of these systems are shown in Fig. 6.\n\nNIR\n\nThe vast majority of ULIRGs (at least 90%), on the other hand, are interacting\ngalaxies undergoing different phases of the merging process, according to optical and\nnear infrared studies (Melnick & Mirabel 1990; Clements et al. 1996; Bushouse et al.\n20\n\n\f3 - (U)LIRGs, Extreme in Star Formation\n\nFigure 7: HST (WFPC2/F814W ) images of some ULIRGs.

The images in these bands show\nULIRGs with a peculiar morphology, tidal tails, bridges, shells and condensations of star\nformation, typical of systems undergoing a merging process. Not only are most or all\nthe ULIRGs in the different samples studied involved in an interaction process, but their\nnuclei also show complex structures (Surace et al. 1998, 2000; Farrah et al. 2001, 2003).\nUsing high angular resolution images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, some authors have suggested that a few ULIRGs are under a multiple merger process (e.g., Borne\net al. 2000; Bushouse et al. 2002). A few examples of the morphology of these systems\nare shown in Fig. 7.\n21\n\nHST\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\n\nFigure 8: Star formation rate evolution with time during major mergers involving galaxies of\ndifferent morphologies (gSa, gSb and gsd for giant-like Sa, Sb and Sd spirals respectively) and\ndifferent orbital parameters: 05ret, 02dir, 01ret and 05dir correspond to different initial orbitals\nparameters, \"ret\" being retrograde and \"dir\" prograde ; the numbers 45 and 90 indicate that\nthe second galaxy is inclined with respect to the orbital plane by this amount.

(2008).\n\n3.2\n\nStar Formation & Dynamical Processes in (U)LIRGs\n\nWhat causes a merger to behave as a (U)LIRG ? Do all merger show at some epoch\na ULIRG phase or special conditions are required to trigger the emission in the far-IR?\nAccording to theoretical simulations, galaxy mergers enhance the star formation (Mihos\n& Hernquist 1994b; 1996; Tissera et al. 2002; Kapferer et al. 2005; Cox et al. 2006).\nThese models take into account the stellar and gas content in both galaxies that are\ninteracting. The initial disk stability is the main parameter affecting the star formation\nsequence: late-type galaxies without bulge are more prone to violent bar instability\nduring an encounter, which drives the internal gas toward the galaxy center to trigger\na nuclear starburst (Mihos & Hernquist 1996). However, the availability of gas in the\ninteracting galaxies is also one of the more constraining parameters, as well as the gas\nphysics adopted (Cox et al. 2004).\nThe observed massive concentrations of gas in some systems in interaction can be\nreproduced (Barnes & Hernquist 1992a, 1996). However, for the last decade there has\nbeen an intense debate on the star formation efficiencies, and hence SFRs, predicted by\nthe numerical simulations of galaxy encounters. There are models able to reproduce the\nobserved SFRs in many (U)LIRGs , though they claim that only interactions between\ntwo gas-rich spirals are able to reach such high luminosities to explain the emission in\nULIRGs , and during short periods in time, \u223c50-150 Myr (Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Bekki\n& Shioya 2001, 2006). Recent simulations show that a significant enhancement of the\n22\n\n\f3 - (U)LIRGs, Extreme in Star Formation\nSFR during a major merger at low redshifts (given by the linear resolution achieved and\nthe initial gas content of the parent galaxies) is quite rare (Bournaud & Duc 2006; Cox\net al. 2008; Di Matteo et al. 2008). It seems to be highly dependent on the mass ratio\nof the galaxies involved in the interaction, an equal-mass ratio of two gas-rich spirals\nbeing the most favored. The orbital geometry represent a secondary factor, though the\nenhancement is more efficient for galaxies in retrograde orbits. Some examples of the\nSFH of simulations of mergers are shown in Fig. 8.\nThere is both theoretical (Toomre & Toomre 1972; Hernquist 1992b; 1993) and observational (Stanford & Bushouse 1991; Genzel et al. 2001; Colina et al. 2001; Tacconi et al.\n2002; Dasyra et al. 2006) evidence that in (U)LIRGs the end product of the encounter\nbetween two disk galaxies can be an early-type galaxy with a moderate mass of 0.1-1 m\u2217\n(m\u2217 = 1.4 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 ) and a de Vaucoulers surface brightness profile (r1/4 ), although\nthis view was initially refused for two reasons:\n\u2022 How do the observed GCs in elliptical form? The discovery of SSCs (see Section 2.1,\npage 5) hidden by dust in interacting systems was proposed by some authors as\nprecursors of GCs (Whitmore & Schweizer 1995; Kassin et al. 2003).\n\u2022 As ellipticals barely contain gas, how can such large amounts of gas involved in\nthe merging process disappear? Galactic superwinds and supernovae explosions\nare a likely explanation. Additionally, the jets coming from the AGNs also expel\nsignificant amount of gas toward the extra-galactic medium.\nAnother aspect of the dynamical evolution of ULIRGs which is worth mentioning\nis the presence of compact star-forming regions at all galactocentric scales, especially\nwithin the tidal tails, in which knots or condensations of star formation have been observed (e.g., Surace et al. 1998). The next section will present in more detail the compact\nstar-forming structures that have been observed in (U)LIRGs (i.e., SSCs and TDG candidates).\n3.3\n\nYoung Compact Star-forming Structures in (U)LIRGs\n\nAs already mentioned in previous sections, the high infrared luminosity in (U)LIRGs is\nbelieved to be mainly caused by the re-emission of hidden starburst activity, which is\ntriggered by a merger process in a significant percentage of LIRGs and practically in\nall ULIRGs . It is not surprising that the studies carried out on these systems have\nfound young compact star-forming regions at all galactocentric distances. Copious studies on The Antennae \u2013on the border line between the non-LIRG and the LIRG class,\nwith a luminosity of LIR =10.99\u2013 have been carried out (e.g., Whitmore & Schweizer\n1995, 1999, 2005, 2010; Fall et al. 2005; Bastian et al. 2006; Mengel et al. 2008). Given\nthe proximity of the system and the use of high angular resolution images from the HST,\n23\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\nthese works have reported the properties of thousands of clusters with typical half-light\nradii of a few pc, the most luminous (MV > \u221214.6) being young (typically \u03c4 . 100 Myr)\nand spanning the mass range 105 -106 M\u2299 , typical properties of SSCs.\nFor more luminous systems only a few studies of compact, massive (i.e., 105 -107 M\u2299)\nand extremely young (i.e., \u03c4 < 10 Myr) circumnuclear star clusters have been reported\n(Scoville et al. 2000; Alonso-Herrero et al. 2002; D\u00edaz-Santos et al. 2007), using NIR images. Moreover, compact condensations compatible with massive young star formation\nin the outermost regions have been detected with near-UV and optical images (Surace\net al. 1998; Surace et al. 2000). The systems sampled in these works are located at such\ndistances (between 40 to hundreds of Mpc) that the observation of intrinsically faint\nclusters was not possible. Additionally, blending can occur and thus, although several\nsystems were sampled in each study, only a total of dozens or few hundreds of cluster-like\nobjects were detected.\nWith half-light radii between about ten to few hundreds of pc, most of the cluster-like\nojects detected in (U)LIRGs may actually be complexes of star clusters. However, the\nsize of the largest objects is similar to that of a typical dwarf galaxy. Given the interacting\nnature of (U)LIRGs (especially ULIRGs) there have also been searches of TDG candidates there. Despite the fact that a priori they have the appropriate nature to harbour\nthese dwarf galaxies, only few studies have been performed so far. The TDG candidate\nin The Superantennae (Mirabel et al. 1991) turned out to be a background object (Weilbacher et al. 2003). Mihos & Bothun (1998) identified only three more candidates in\na sample of one LIRG and three ULIRGs. More recently, Monreal-Ibero et al. (2007)\nhave performed a systematic search of TDGs in a sample of nine ULIRGs. A total of\ntwelve candidates were identified and characterized. They share similar properties to\nobserved TDG candidates in other samples, such as high metallicty (i.e., Z\u2299 or Z\u2299 /3),\neffective radii of a few hundreds of pc and total masses higher than 108 M\u2299 . That work\nalso studied the stability of their candidates against internal motions and forces from the\nparent galaxy and found that five out of the twelve show high- medium or high likelihood\nof survival as future TDG.\n\n3.4\n\nISO\n\n(U)LIRGs in the High-z Universe\n\nWith the advent of satellites and ground-based instruments working on the IR, millimeter and radio wavelenghts, many high-z luminous infrared galaxies have been discovered. Although these galaxies do not dominate the luminosity function in the local\nUniverse, they become more important as we observe them farther. Surveys carried on\nwith the InfraRed Space Observatory showed that the evolution of the luminosity density in these galaxies is very rapid until z = 1, and no much farther increase is left for\nthe higher redshifts (Franceschini et al. 2001).\nThe Spitzer telescope, working in the 3-180 \u03bcm range, allowed to survey the\n24\n\n\f3 - (U)LIRGs, Extreme in Star Formation\n\nFigure 9: Evolution of the co-moving IR luminosity density with redshift (red solid line). The\nblue dashed and the orange dotted-dashed lines show the contributions of LIRGs and ULIRGs ,\nrespectively, at different redshifts. Figure taken from Caputi et al. (2007).\n\n(U)LIRG population up to redshift z \u223c 3 (Le Floc'h et al. 2005; Franceschini et al.\n2005; P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005; Caputi et al. 2007). From these studies we know that\nat z > 1 LIRGs are the major contributors of the co-moving star formation rate density\nof the Universe, and at z \u2243 2, (U)LIRGs have similar contributions (see Fig. 9), and they\naccount for at least half of the newly born stars by z \u223c 1.5.\nIt is also believed that at these redshifts the main source of energy in (U)LIRGs corresponds to star formation activity. Studies carried out with Spitzer data confirm the\nimportance of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons up to z \u223c 2.5 (Yan et al. 2005), and\nworks on the millimeter and radio wavelenghts have estimated that only about 25% of\nthe (U)LIRG population harbour an AGN (Ivison et al. 2004; Egami et al. 2004).\nSources with SFRs up to ten times higher than in ULIRGs , known as\nsub-millimeter galaxies, were detected with the sub-millimeter instrument SCUBA, operating at 450 and 850 \u03bcm (Smail et al. 1997). Given their peculiar morphologies, high\nluminosities and energy spectral distributions, it is very likely that they are the counterparts of (U)LIRGs at high redshifts (z & 2; Smail et al. 1997; Blain et al. 2002; Frayer\net al. 2004). Follow-up multi-wavelength observations of SMGs showed that some of these\ngalaxies exhibit multiple components, a clear indication of ongoing interaction processes\n(Ivison et al. 2002; Smail et al. 2002).\n25\n\nPAH\n\nSMG\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\n(U)LIRGs can also become relevant in the context of clumpy galaxies at high redshifts. Star-forming galaxies become increasingly irregular at higher redshifts, with a blue\nclumpy structure, asymmetry and lack of central concentration (Abraham et al. 1996; van\nden Bergh et al. 1996; Im et al. 1999). It has been claimed that clumps in clumpy galaxies represent star-forming complexes intrinsically more massive by one or two orders\nof magnitudes than similar-size complexes in local galaxies (Efremov 1995; Elmegreen\net al. 2009; Gallagher et al. 2010). Although most of the clumpy galaxies, observed at\nz = 0.7-2, do not show signs of interactions, they might share the extreme star formation\nproperties with local (U)LIRGs .\nSince all these galaxies at high redshift seem to be equivalent to the (U)LIRGs observed\nin the local Universe, in order to understand them and the role they have played on the\nstar and galaxy formation in the early Universe it is important to know in detail the\nphysical properties and the dynamical processes that take place in local (U)LIRGs .\n\n4\n\nIFU\n\nDL\n\nThesis Project\n\nIn general, the investigation of compact star-forming objects in galaxies can be done\nusing two different approaches: (i) surveys of a significative number of galaxies, useful\nto study the global integrated properties and to make statistical studies; (ii) and the\nanalysis of a particular galaxy to study in detail the star formation and disruption processes occurring there. For the past few decades much effort has been applied to study\nhow the interaction of galaxies affects the star and galaxy formation, using the stateof-the-art instrumentation (e.g., HST studies in M51, NGC 4038/4039 or NGC 7252;\nintegral field unit spectroscopic observations of TDG candidates). Numerical modeling\nof galaxy encounters, with a continuous improvement of the spatial resolution and the enlargement of the number of simulations that allows us to explore each time more realistic\nscenarios, has also become an important complementation to observations to advance in\nthe field. All these theoretical and observational studies have provided significant results\nand observational restrictions to the physical processes occurring in galaxy mergers (e.g.,\nthe role of the infant mortality, physical constrains of the galaxies under interaction for\nthe star formation to be enhanced more effectively, etc.).\nBut, is the star formation in (U)LIRGs ruled by the same processes as in less luminous galaxy interactions? Can a different mode of star formation, in which more\nmassive objects can be formed as a result of the interaction, take place there? Does\nthe star formation evolve as the interaction proceeds? Are the formation and disruption\nprocesses universal? These are some questions that remain unanswered because, apart\nfrom very few and limited studies, the most energetic systems in the local Universe have\nremained barely explored in this field. This is in part because (U)LIRGs normally are\nlocated at such distances (i.e., normally at luminosity distances farther than 60 Mpc and\nthere is only one ULIRG closer than 100 Mpc) that the detection of large number of\n26\n\n\f4 - Thesis Project\nindividual compact star-forming regions is not possible with the best instrumentation\navailable today. The studies with the largest samples correspond to those of Surace et\nal. (1998, 2000), that encompass less than a dozen of ULIRGs each and detect a few\nhundred compact regions.\nThis thesis presents the study of compact star-forming regions in the most luminous low-z (U)LIRGs . With a sample of 32 systems, larger than in previous works,\nit increases considerably the statistics with the detection of a few thousand compact\nstar-forming regions. The galaxies in the sample represent different interaction phases\n(first-contact, pre-merger, merger and post-merger) and cover a wide luminosity range\n(11.46 \u2264 LIR \u2264 12.54). The project is based mainly on optical high resolution images taken with the ACS on board the HST telescope, data from a high linear resolution simulation of a major galaxy encounter, and with the combination of optical\nIntegral Field Spectroscopy from the INTEGRAL (WHT) and VIMOS (VLT) instruments. The main topics covered in this project are: (i) the identificantion and empirical\ncharacterization of the compact star-forming regions identified in our sample of low-z\n(U)LIRGs; (ii) the comparison of their properties with those of compact objects identified\nin a high linear resolution of a galaxy encounter; (iii) the identification and characterization of H\u03b1 -emitting complexes, and the study if their nature is compatible with being\nprogenitors to TDGs. The sample selection, the different sets of data analyzed and the\ngeneral analysis techniques are presented in Chapter I. Then, this thesis is divided into\nthe three main topics, each one covered in one Chapter:\n\u2022 Characterization of compact star-forming regions\nIn Chapter II we present an empirical characterization of optically-selected compact\nstar-forming regions (knots) in a representative sample of 32 low-z (i.e., z < 0.1)\n(U)LIRGs. It shows the first attempt at obtaining an homogeneous and statistically\nsignificant study of the photometric properties (luminosities, colors and sizes) of\noptically-selected knots of star formation found in these systems as a function of the\ninfrared luminosity, morphology (i.e., interaction phase) and radial distance to the\nnucleus of the galaxy. The luminosity function is also evaluated and compared with\nthat obtained in other studies. Finally, their properties are compared to clumpy\nstructures identified in high-z star-forming galaxies.\n\u2022 Comparison with a high linear resolution simulation of a major merger\nThe previous chapter represents the starting point in Chapter III, where the first\ndirect comparison of the properties of stellar regions (simulated knots) identified\nin the high spatial resolution galaxy simulation of Bournaud et al. (2008b) with\nthe knots detected in our sample is performed. Using stellar population synthesis\ntechniques, the luminosities, colors and LFs of the simulated knots are evaluated\nat different interaction phases. A direct comparison with the properties of the\nobserved knots makes possible a physical interpretation of the results from observations. How close are the predictions of the simulation from real encounters? How\n27\n\nIFS\n\n\fGeneral Introduction\ncan we understand some of the properties of the observed knots? These are some\nquestions we investigate throughout the chapter.\n\u2022 Search and characterization of TDG candidates\nThe third part of the thesis is presented in Chapter IV. We characterize the extranuclear star-forming regions of a sample of (U)LIRGs using the combined information of Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data together with high resolution\nimages from the HST. This chapter is devoted to the search of potential TDG candidates in local (U)LIRGs. Properties such as the metallicity, extinction, age and\nmass of the young stellar population, H\u03b1 luminosity, dynamical mass, velocity\ndispersion, relative velocity etc., are derived and compared with those of TDG candidates in the literature. We use these parameters to estimate the likelihood of\nsurvival of these regions as future TDGs . We also estimate the implications of\nTDG formation to the overall dwarf population and primordial dwarf formation at\nhigh-z.\n\n28\n\n\fI\nSample Selection, Dataset and Data\nTreatment\nChapter\n\nOverview\nThis Chapter presents the sample upon which this thesis is\nbased. The selection criteria and the main morphological properties of the galaxies are described. The different sets of data\npresented and the general analysis techniques applied to perform this study are also discussed in detail.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nSample Selection and General Properties\nThe Sample\n\nThe galaxies for this thesis were selected from the flux-limited IRAS Revisited Galaxy\nSample (RBGS, Sanders et al. 2003) and from the sample of Sanders et al. (1988), using\nthe following additional criteria:\n\u2022 To sample the wide range of IR luminosities in (U)LIRGs.\n\u2022 To cover all types of nuclear activity (i.e., different ionization mechanisms) to avoid\nbiases.\n\u2022 To span different phases of interaction, from first approach to final merger phases.\n\u2022 To optimize the linear scales by selecting low-z galaxies, which would allow us to\nhave a relatively high linear resolution and to detect intrinsically faint compact\nregions.\n29\n\n\fChap.

The I -band, less affected by extinction, can indicate the extent of\nthe system and the tidal features emerging from it, whereas the B -band can give us\nand idea of the young population. Two of the systems were not considered for this\nstudy, since they are so close (DL . 40 Mpc) that individual stars belonging to them\nstart to contaminate, and selection effects can be encountered for these galaxies. For\ninstance, the faintest objects detected in IRAS 10257-4338 by Knierman et al. (2003)\nwith the WFPC2 can be individual stars (though they expect them to be few). Since\nthe ACS images are more sensitive at similar exposure times, more individual stars can\nbe detected. In addition, the galaxies in the sample were observed or planned to be\nobserved with IFS (VIMOS, INTEGRAL and PMAS).\nOur sample comprises 32 low-z systems, 20 LIRGs and 12 ULIRGs . Individual\nproperties of the systems are presented in Table I.1. The sample is certainly not complete in either volume, flux or luminosity. However, it is essentially representative of\nthe local (U)LIRG population (see also Fig. I.1): (i) it covers the luminosity range\n11.39 \u2264 LIR a \u2264 12.54 and the redshift range 0.016 \u2264 z \u2264 0.124 (from 65 to about 550\nMpc), with a median value of 0.037; (ii) it spans all types of nuclear activity, with different\nexcitation mechanisms such as LINER (i.e., shocks, strong winds, weak AGN ), HII (star\na\n\n30\n\nAs defined in the previous chapter, for simplicity we adopt LIR to be LIR (L\u2299 ) \u2261 log (LIR )\n\n\f1 - Sample Selection and General Properties\nformation) and Seyfert-like (presence of an AGN ); (iii) and the different morphologies\nusually identified in these systems are also sampled (see Section 1.2 and Fig. I.2). Therefore, the sample is appropriate for the purpose of the present work.\n1.2\n\nMorphologies Sampled\n\nThe galaxies exhibit a variety of morphologies, from a wide pair with a projected nuclear distance of 54 kpc, to close nuclei with a projected radial distance of d . 5 kpc, and\nto a single nucleus with a distorted stellar envelope. We identified a morphology class for\neach system of the sample by using the red (F814W filter in ACS and WFPC2 instruments) HST images (see Section 2.1). A merging classification scheme similar to that\ngiven by Veilleux et al. (2002) was considered. Yet, due to our limited number of objects\nsome grouping was made, so as to have enough statistics in all phases. For instance,\nphases I and II in Veilleux et al. (2002) were grouped for this study. The sample was\ndivided in four groups according to their projected morphology and trying to match well\nidentified temporal snapshots in the evolution of the interaction according to the models\n(see images in Fig. I.2):\nI-II. First Approach.\u2013 In this early phase, the first passage has not been completed. It\nis prior to the first close passage or during that first passage. The galaxy disks remain\nrelatively unperturbed and bars and tidal tails have not yet formed. In some cases the\ndisks can overlap, but no projected morphological disruption is seen on either galaxy.\nSome examples of systems in this phase are IRAS 06259-4708 and IRAS 07027-6011.\nIII. Pre-Merger. \u2013 Two identifiable nuclei, with very well identified tidal tails and\nbridges, characterizes this phase. Both disks are still recognizable. This occurs\n200-400 Myr after the first approach, according to the similar morphologies observed\nin Bournaud et al. (2008b) models (see Section 2.3). Some examples representing this\nphase are IRAS 08572+3915 and IRAS 12112+0305.\nIV. Merger. \u2013 We only included phase IVa of Veilleux et al. (2002), since the systems\nin phase IVb have morphologies more similar to those in phase V than in IVa. In\nthis phase both nuclei have apparently coalesced. We consider that the nuclei have\ncoalesced as soon as their separation is less than 1.5 kpc, since numerical simulations\nhave shown that by the time the two nuclei have reached a separation of \u2264 1 kpc,\nthe stellar system has basically achieved equilibrium (Mihos 1999; Naab et al. 2006).\nLong tails and shell structures are seen in this phase. Both disks are no longer\nrecognizable, but a common internal structure has formed. This phase is seen 500-700\nMyr after the first approach, according to the models mentioned. IRAS 04315-0840\nand IRAS F10038-3338 are representative galaxies of this phase. It has to be taken into\naccount that we are considering projected distances. Hence, those systems with double\n31\n\n\fChap.

Post-Merger. \u2013 We also included phase IVb of Veilleux et al. (2002). In this phase\nthere are no prominent and bright tidal tails or bridges, since their surface brightness\nstarts to fall below the detection limit, though some shell structures around the nucleus\ncan still be detected. These isolated nuclei can have disturbed stellar envelopes, similar\nto those in the previous phase, indirectly indicating the past interaction. Typical ages\nof \u03c4 & 1 Gyr after the first passage characterizes the timescale of this phase, according\nto the models mentioned. IRAS 05189-2524 and IRAS 12116-5615 are good examples\nof systems in this phase.\nSince this classification was performed only by evaluating the apparent morphology\nof the systems under study, it is always subject to improvements based on data with a\nhigher angular resolution and sensitivity, and deeper imaging (i.e., to observe envelopes\nin post-mergers). Therefore, misclassification could occur in a few systems. Moreover,\nfor certain studies, slightly different and simpler classifications have been used previously\n(Rodr\u00edguez-Zaur\u00edn et al. 2011; see also Table I.1). Although they have the advantage of\nreducing subjectivity and therefore uncertainty, their classification is too coarse for detail\ncomparison with model predictions. While the classification of a few objects can differ,\nas is the case for IRAS 06259-4807 and IRAS 08520-6850 in common with Rodr\u00edguezZaur\u00edn's sample (the definitions of the early phases in both studies are slightly different),\nthe agreement between both classifications is excellent. Using this classification, 4 systems were assigned to category I-II, 13 to category III, 8 to category IV and 7 to category\nV (see Table I.1).\n\n2\n\nData Acquisition\n\nFor this thesis we used a variety of different but complementary data sets: high angular\nresolution imaging as observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, IFS data from the fiberbased optical IFU instruments and data from a high linear resolution simulation of a\nwet galaxy merger. They are all based on completely different concepts, and each one\nrequires a different treatment, in terms of data reduction and analysis techniques. The\navailable dataset from observations for each galaxy is shown in Table I.2.\n2.1\n\nPhotometric Data: Images from the HST\n\nObservations with the HST , a 2.4m reflector telescope carried into orbit by a space\nshuttle in 1990, have great advantages compared to ground-based facilities. Thanks to\nthe absence of the atmospheric veil the observations are not limited by seeing conditions\n33\n\n\fChap.

The main photometric datasets used in this thesis cover the optical spectral\nrange, though complementary infrared images are also used.\n\n2.1.1\nACS\n\nOptical Images\n\nIn this thesis, we mainly use archive data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys,\na third generation axial instrument aboard the HST . It includes three independent\nchannels that cover the ultraviolet to the near-infrared spectral range: the Wide Field\nChannel (WFC), the High-Resolution Channel (HRC) and the Solar Blind Channel.\n36\n\n\f2 - Data Acquisition\n\nFigure I.3: Normalized response curve for the optical filters used in this thesis. The black\nsolid lines represent the response curves for the ACS filters, while the dashed lines show the\nresponse curves for the WFPC2 filters. Very well-known ionizing lines are also plotted (vertical\nlines) for z = 0.4, approximately the median redshift of the sample.\n\nMost of the images in this study were taken with the WFC, which consists of two butted\n2048\u00d74096 pixel CCD with a plate scale of 0.05\u2032\u2032/pixel and an effective field of view of\n202\u2032\u2032 \u00d7202\u2032\u2032 .\n\nFoV\n\nACS broad-band images were retrieved for thirty systems from the Hubble Legacy\nArchive, with the filters F814W and F435W (see response curves in Fig. I.3). The\nformer is equivalent to the ground-based Johnson-Cousins I, whereas the latter differs\nfrom the ground-based Johnson-Cousins B between 7 and 12% in flux (Sirianni et al.\n2005). Total integration times were taken from 720 to 870s with filter F814W and from\n1260 to 1500s with filter F435W.\nFor IRAS 13536+1836 and IRAS 15206+3342, Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images were taken. This instrument, which covers the spectral range from about 1150 to\n10500 \u00c5, is composed of four cameras that operate simultaneously. Three of them (chips\n37\n\nWFPC2\n\n\fChap. I\n\nSample Selection, Dataset and Data Treatment\n\n2, 3, 4) have a plate scale of 0.1\u2032\u2032/pixel and a FoV of 80\u2032\u2032 \u00d780\u2032\u2032 , and form the Wide Field\nCamera. The fourth (chip 1), with a plate scale of 0.046\u2032\u2032/pixel and a FoV of 36\u2032\u2032 \u00d736\u2032\u2032 ,\nis the so-called Planetary Camera (PC). Images were taken with the filters F814W and\nF439W (see response curves in Fig. I.3), being equivalent to ground-based Johnsons I\nand B, respectively (Origlia & Leitherer 2000). Total integration times of about 350s\nwere taken with filter F814W and of 1000s with filter F439W. Here, the systems fall in\nthe PC chip.\nWhenever both ACS and WFPC2 images were available in both filters, ACS images\nwere preferred for its superior sensitivity and larger FoV. From now on, we will refer to\nthe blue filter as F435W for ACS and WFPC2 for simplicity.\nImages were reduced on the fly (HST pipeline), with the highest quality available\nreference files at the time of retrieval. The calibrated ACS F435W images had only few\ncosmic rays remaining, since 3 images had been observed and then combined. However,\nall the ACS F814W images were severely contaminated with cosmic rays in a 6\u2032\u2032 -width\nband across the entire FoV. Two exposures had been taken and when they did not overlap\nthe HST pipeline was not able to discriminate the cosmic rays. In most cases that band\nwent through part of the system, covering about 10-20% of its extension. Cosmic ray\nrejection was then carried out using the IRAFb task credit with the aid of the blue images\nsince they were barely contaminated. Most of the systems have observations that cover\nthe entire FoV with only this instrument and the two filters, so the aid of multi-band\nimages was limited to few systems.\nOnce the photometric data is processed, the derived counts can be transformed into\nthe Vega system magnitudes using:\n\nm\u03bb = \u22122.5 \u00d7 log (DN) + Zeropoint\u03bb\n\n(I.1)\n\nwhere \u03bb refers to photometric band (I or B ), DN corresponds to the integrated counts\nper second in the defined aperture, and Zeropoint a constant of value 25.536 and 25.759\nfor the ACS F814W and F435W broadbands, respectively (21.678 and 20.877 for the\nWFPC2 filters). The Zeropoints were derived using the calibration reference papers\nby Sirianni et al. (2005) and Holtzman et al. (1995), for the ACS and WFPC2 data\nrespectively.\n\nb\n\nIRAF software is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO), which is\noperated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., in cooperation\nwith the National Science Foundation.\n\n38\n\n\fTable I.2: Available data: HST archive and IFS data\nIRAS name\n(1)\n00506+7248\n02512+1446\n04315-0840\n05189-2524\n06076-2139\n06259-4708\n07027-6011\n08355-4944\n08520-6850\n08572+3915\n\n12116-5615\n12540+5708\n13001-2339\n13428+5608\n13536+1836\n14348-1447\n15206+3342\n15250+3609\n15327+2340\n16104+5235\nF17138-1017\n17208-0014\nF18093-5744\n18329+5950\n20550+1656\n22491-1808\n23007+0836\n23128-5919\n\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nWFPC2\nACS\nWFPC2\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\nACS\n\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nSanders, 5982\nEvans, 10592\nSanders, 5982\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\nEvans, 10592\n\nObs.\ndate\n(4)\n09/05\n07/06\n08/06\n08/06\n11/05\n04/06\n09/05\n09/05\n04/06\n12/05\n06/06\n11/05\n12/05\n02/06\n09/05\n05/06\n02/06\n11/05\n11/95\n04/06\n09/95\n01/06\n01/06\n09/05\n03/06\n04/06\n04/06\n10/05\n04/06\n05/06\n06/06\n03/06\n\nExp.\ntime (s)\n(5)\n800,\n720,\n720,\n730,\n720,\n780,\n830,\n780,\n870,\n750,\n\n1500\n1260\n1260\n1275\n1260\n1350\n1425\n1350\n1485\n1305\n750, 1305\n740, 1290\n720, 1260\n720, 1260\n830, 1425\n830, 1425\n720, 1260\n820, 1425\n360, 1030\n720, 1260\n343, 750\n750, 1305\n720, 1260\n800, 1380\n720, 1260\n720, 1260\n830, 1425\n830, 1425\n720, 1260\n720, 1260\n720, 1260\n830, 1425\n\nHST NIR\ndata\n(6)\n\nPI and\nproposal ID\n(7)\n\nObs.\ndate\n(8)\n\nExp.\ntime (s)\n(9)\n\nIFS data\n(10)\n\nPI and\nproject ID\n(11)\n\nObs.\ndate\n(12)\n\nExp.\ntime (s)\n(13)\n\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nWFC3\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\nNICMOS\n\nAlonso-Herrero, 10169\nRieke, 7218\nVeilleux, 9875\nSurace, 11235\nSurace, 11235\nSurace, 11235\nSurace, 11235\nSurace, 11235\nMaiolino, 9726\nScoville, 7219\nSurace, 11235\nVeilleux, 9875\nMaiolino, 9726\nLow, 7213\nScoville, 7219\nScoville, 7219\nMaiolino, 9726\nMaiolino, 9726\nAlonso-Herrero, 10169\nScoville, 7219\nAlonso-Herrero, 10169\nSurace, 11235\nScoville, 7219\nScoville, 7219\nMaiolino, 9726\n\n10/04\n02/98\n08/04\n06/09\n06/08\n06/08\n06/08\n05/08\n03/04\n11/97\n07/07\n09/04\n05/04\n12/97\n12/97\n11/97\n01/04\n12/03\n09/04\n10/97\n09/04\n03/09\n11/97\n11/97\n10/03\n\n311\n191\n2560\n2395\n4990\n4990\n2495\n2300\n160\n192\n2495\n2560\n599\n480\n480\n223\n599\n599\n240\n223\n240\n2495\n480\n351\n599\n\nVIMOS\nVIMOS\nVIMOS\nVIMOS\nVIMOS\nVIMOS\nVIMOS\nINTEGRAL\nINTEGRAL\nVIMOS\nVIMOS\nVIMOS\nINTEGRAL\nINTEGRAL\nVIMOS\nINTEGRAL\nVIMOS\nINTEGRAL\nINTEGRAL\nINTEGRAL\nINTEGRAL\nINTEGRAL\nINTEGRAL\nVIMOS\nINTEGRAL\nVIMOS\nINTEGRAL\nVIMOS\nVIMOS\n\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nColina, 98ACAT26 & C4\nColina, 98ACAT26 & C4\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nColina, 98ACAT26 & C4\nColina, 98ACAT26 & C4\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nColina, D\nArribas, 076.B-0479(A)\nColina, 98ACAT26\nColina, C4\nColina, 98ACAT26\nColina, 98ACAT26\nColina, 98ACAT26\nColina, W/200A/27\nArribas, 081.B-0108(A)\nColina, 98ACAT26\nArribas, 081.B-0108(A)\nArribas, P15\nArribas, 081.B-0108(A)\nArribas, 081.B-0108(A)\n\n03/08\n12/06\n12/06\n12/06\n12/06\n03/07\n03/07\n04/98\n01/11\n03/07\n03/07\n03/08\n04/98\n01/11\n03/07\n03/02\n03/07\n04/98\n04/01\n04/98\n04/98\n04/98\n05/01\n06/09\n04/98\n06/09\n07/06\n07/09\n07/09\n\n2880\n3000\n3000\n3000\n6000\n3000\n3000\n16200\n9000\n3000\n3000\n2880\n9000\n7500\n2250\n3600\n6000\n4500\n4500\n7200\n7200\n9000\n9000\n3400\n7800\n6800\n4500\n6800\n3400\n\nNotes.

I\n2.1.2\nNICMOS\n\nSample Selection, Dataset and Data Treatment\nComplementary NIR Images\n\nThe Near Infrared Object and Spectrometer consists of three individual cameras\n(NIC1, NIC2, NIC3) located in one side of the HST FoV and designed to operate independently. These cameras operate at different magnification scales (0.043\u2032\u2032 , 0.075\u2032\u2032 and\n0.2\u2032\u2032 for NIC1, NIC2 and NIC3, respectively). Its spectral coverage ranges from 0.8 to\n2.5 \u03bcm. Since it works in the NIR, the detector is cooled to cryogenic temperatures\nto avoid the thermal contamination coming from the environment and the instrument\nelectronics itself.\nComplementary NICMOS broad-band images with filter F160W (\u223cH ) were also available for the majority of galaxies, which were helpful to locate the nuclei of the systems.\nHowever, they were not included in the main photometric study since they have small\nFoV (20\u2032\u2032 \u00d720\u2032\u2032 ), not covering the outskirts of the systems or interacting tail-bridge structures.\nThese data were also calibrated on the fly (HST pipeline), with the highest quality\navailable reference files at the time of retrieval. There is one effect that appears in the\nNICMOS data and that is not included in the standard pipeline: the so-called pedestal\neffect. This is an additive signal that appears in the NICMOS images when the amplifiers\nare switched on, and that have different values depending on the camera quadrant. This\neffect is detected as flat-field residuals in the calibrated images. In the present case no\nrelevant residuals related to the pedestal effects were detected, and thus no additional\ncorrection was applied to the images. The only aspect that was improved with respect\nto the pipeline was the re-combination of the dithered individual exposures to remove\nthe values of the column 128, which is thought to be affected by uncertainties in detector\nshading corrections (it is considered as a bad column).\n\nWFC3\n\nFor IRAS 06076-2139 we also retrieved recently released data (end of 2010) from the\nWide Field Camera 3, a fourth-generation UVIS/IR imager aboard the HST . With a\nFoV of 135\u2032\u2032 \u00d7127\u2032\u2032 and a pixel scale of 0.13\u2032\u2032/pixel, the near infrared channel covers\na much higher field than its predecessor, the NICMOS instrument. We retrieved the\nprocessed WFC3/IR H -band (F160W) image.\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nSpectroscopic Data\nIntegral Field Spectroscopy\n\nThe general term 3D-spectroscopy refers to those techniques that allow to obtain\nspatially-resolved spectra over a two dimensional field. In an extragalactic context, each\npoint of the galaxy (\u03b1, \u03b4) has associated a spectrum (\u03bb), and all the information has to be\nstored in a two-dimensional detector. The Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) is one of the\nmost widely used 3D-spectroscopy methods. This technique simultaneously obtains the\n40\n\n\f2 - Data Acquisition\nspectral and spatial information for a given telescope pointing (Allington-Smith 2007).\nOne of the fundamental advantages with respect to other 3D-spectroscopy methods is\nthe data homogeneity. This technique presents a good compromise between the exposure\ntime, resolution, and homogeneity of the data.\n\nFigure I.4: A summary of the four main techniques of integral field spectroscopy. Figure taken\nfrom Allington-Smith (2007).\n\nSince the '80s several instruments have been designed using different IFS techniques.\nAllington-Smith (2007) gives a recent review of the most popular present and future\nIFUs (see also Fig. I.4). All these techniques are based on dividing the light coming from\nthe source and dispersing each of the subdivisions to obtain its spectrum. The data for\nthis thesis were taken using fiber arrays or their combination with lenslets as integral\nfield unit (IFU):\n\u2022 Fiber Array: In this case, a fiber array is used to subdivide the FoV in the\nfocal plane of the telescope. The fibers are then reordered forming a pseudo-slit\nand the information dispersed by a conventional spectrograph (Fig. I.4, second\npanel). The low cross-talk derived from the reordering of the fibers and the large\nspectral coverage represent the best advantages of this configuration. However,\nthis configuration has two main disadvantages: round fibers cannot fill a twodimensional region completely and the light beam is widen as it travels across the\nfiber (focal degradation). The INTEGRAL instrument (Arribas et al. 1998) uses\nthis IFU.\n\u2022 Lenslets+Fiber: Some disadvantages associated to the pure fiber-based IFU (e.g.,\nflux losses and focal degradation) can be avoided by coupling them to a lens array\n41\n\n\fChap. I\n\nSample Selection, Dataset and Data Treatment\n\nat the focal plane. This way, the spatial coverage is optimal, and the small pupil\ncreated at the entrance of the fiber core avoid light losses and minimize the focal\nratio degradation. However, in general these systems need for additional optical\nmechanisms that can lead to a decrease of the system efficiency. Among others,\nPMAS (Roth et al. 2005) and VIMOS (LeFevre et al. 2003) instruments make use\nof this technique.\n\n2.2.2\n\nObservations and Spectral Maps\n\nMost of the LIRGs and a few ULIRGs in our sample were observed with VIMOS\n(mounted on the Nasmyth focus B on the VLT). The observations were carried out with\nthe high-resolution mode \"HR-Orange\" (grating GG435), whose spectral range covers\nfrom about 5200 to 7400 \u00c5. The FoV and the spatial scale in this mode are 27\u2032\u2032\u00d727\u2032\u2032 and\n0.67\u2032\u2032 per fiber, respectively (i.e., 40\u00d740 fibers, 1600 spectra). A square four-pointing\ndithering pattern was used, with a relative offset of 2.7\u2032\u2032 . The exposure time per pointing\nwas between 720 and 850 seconds and therefore, the total integration time per galaxy\nis in general 2880-3400 seconds. Details on the data reduction and calibration can be\nfound in Arribas et al. (2008) and in Rodr\u00edguez-Zaur\u00edn et al. (2011). To summarize,\nthe data were reduced with a combinations of the pipeline recipe Esorex (included in the\npipeline provided by ESO), and a series of IDL and IRAF customized scripts. Esorex\nperformed the basic data reduction (bias subtraction, flat field correction, spectra tracing\nand extraction, correction of fiber and pixel transmission and relative flux calibration).\nThen, the four quadrants per pointing were reduced individually and combined into\na single data-cube associated to each pointing. The final data-cube per object was\ngenerated combining the four independent dithered pointings, containing a total of 1936\nspectra.\nThe rest of the ULIRGs in our sample were observed with INTEGRAL, connected\nto the camera WYFFOS (Bingham et al. 1994) and mounted on the 4.2 m William\nHerschel Telescope. The observations were carried out with the grating R600B, with a\nspectral range that covers from about 5000 to 8000 \u00c5. The FoV varies depending on the\nINTEGRAL dithering and pointings used, though in general it is around 23.0\u2032\u2032\u00d7 16.3\u2032\u2032 .\nThe angular sampling is 0.90\u2032\u2032 per fiber. In general, between 4 and 6 pointings of 1500\nseconds were taken and therefore, the total integration time per galaxy is 6000-9000 seconds. Details on the data reduction and calibration can be found in Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn et al.\n(2009b) and references therein. To summarize, the data reduction of the two-dimensional\nfiber spectra was performed using the IRAF environment, following the standard procedures applied for this type of data: bias subtraction, scattered light subtraction and\ncross-talk corrections, spectra tracing and extraction, wavelength calibration, flat-field\ncorrection, sky subtraction, relative flux calibration, image combination and absolute\nflux calibration.\nThe absolute flux uncertainty for the VIMOS and INTEGRAL data corresponds to\n42\n\n\f2 - Data Acquisition\nabout 10-20%. After the data reduction, every galaxy has a set of spectra, each one\nassociated with the region observed with the individual fibers. The emission lines from\neach galaxy were analyzed by fitting them to Gaussian profiles. In both sets of data,\nthe H\u03b1 line lays within the spectral range and, once calibrated, H\u03b1 line maps were then\ngenerated. Each pixel on the map (commonly called spaxel) has the information of the\nregion observed with the individual fibers. Maps with the H\u03b1 equivalent width, the\n[NII] lines, and the oxygen ([OIII] \u03bb\u03bb4959,5007) and H\u03b2 lines for galaxies observed with\nINTEGRAL were also produced. In this thesis, we make use of the maps published in\nGarc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn et al. (2009b) and in Rodr\u00edguez-Zaur\u00edn et al. (2011) for the systems in our\nsample.\n\n2.3\n\nData from numerical Simulations\n\nWe analyzed the wet galaxy merger simulation of Bournaud et al. (2008b) at different\ntimes. The simulation is performed with a particle-mesh code based on a FFT Poisson\nsolver for the gravity. The gas dynamics is modeled with a sticky-particle scheme, and\na Schmidt law is used for star formation. Supernovae feedback is taken into account in\nthe simulation with the scheme proposed by Mihos and Hernquist (1994a). The initial\nsetup was chosen so as to be representative of an equal-mass wet merger of two spirals\nat z < 1 with an initial gas fraction of 17%. The encounter corresponds to a prograde\norbit for one galaxy and a retrograde orbit for the other, with an inclination angle of the\nencounter of 30\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, respectively. A total number of 36 million particles are used\nin the simulation, corresponding to 6 million particles per galaxy per component (gas,\nstars and dark matter), having each stellar disk an initial mass of 2\u00d71011 M\u2299 .\nThe dataset corresponds to 81 datacubes with the spatial distribution of young particles of equal mass (8333 M\u2299) regularly spaced in time, 13 Myr between two time-steps,\ncovering the temporal evolution of the galaxy encounter up to 1053 Myr. Thus, each\ndatacube corresponds to one snapshot of the simulation. All the components of the simulation (gas, young stars, old stars and dark matter) were also simulated but the study\nwas carried out only on young stars. We extracted a total of 78 snapshots, since the\nstar formation is triggered at t=39 Myr, where our analysis starts. Example of total\nstellar mass density maps at different interaction times, showing how the morphologies\nevolve with the merging process, are shown in Bournaud et al. (2008b), while the whole\nseries is presented in Belles. et al. (in prep). Fig. I.5 shows similar maps, but referring\nto the mass density of the stellar particles created in the simulation (excluding the old\ncomponent prior to the merger epoch). This way we give an idea on how the new formed\nstars distribute throughout the merging process.\nTo identify the stellar regions (simulated knots), the datacube with the 3D position\nof the particles was projected on three 2D-planes. Knots were then identified using an\nalgorithm based on particle counts and extracted above a S/N with respect to the local\nbackground. Finally, they were cross-correlated between the planes to recover their 3D\n43\n\n\fChap.

Thus, the simulated knots represent a group of bound sticky particles. A\nthorough description of the analysis and the methodology applied to the detection, measurement of the mass and tracking of a knot is explained in Belles et al. (in preparation).\nThe linear resolution achieved (the softening length of the gravitational potential) in\nthis model corresponds to 32 pc. With a stellar mass resolution of about 105 M\u2299 , the\nsimulated knots are typically more massive than 106 M\u2299 and up to 109 M\u2299 .\n\n3\n\nGeneral Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis Techniques\n\nIn this section, we describe the general methodology and tools used to derive the\ndifferent properties of the objects under study in this thesis (i.e., compact regions of\nstar formation in our sample). Some of these techniques are based only on the use of\nphotometric data (e.g., analysis of the LFs), others on spectroscopic data (e.g., metallicity\nderivations) and a few of them combine both datasets (e.g., stellar population models,\ndynamical mass derivations). The subsequent chapters in this thesis include additional\nanalysis procedures (e.g., detection of the compact regions of interest) that have been\nkept there for a better comprehension of the text.\n44\n\n\f3 - General Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis Techniques\n3.1\n\nDetermination of Sizes\n\nThe knowlege of the size of a stellar object is important to set up constraints on\nits nature and properties. The derivation of its size is not straightforward since some\nconsiderations have to be taken into account, such as the shape of the light profile, the\ncontamination of the point spread function, the usage of different photometric filters,\nect.\n\nPSF\n\nIn this section, we explain how the sizes of the stellar objects under study in this\nthesis were derived. Specifically, the effective radius \u2013identified as an approximation to\nthe half-light radius\u2013 and the total size.\n\n3.1.1\n\nEffective Radius\n\nradius (pc)\n\nrF435W\nknot (pc)\neff\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n100\n\nradius = (2.3\u00b10.1)reff + (38\u00b15)\n\n10\n\n10\n10\n\n100\nrF814W\nknot (pc)\neff\n\n10\n\n100\nrF814W\n(pc)\neff\n\n1000\n\nFigure I.6: Left: Relation between effective radii of all the knots measured in images with filter\nF814W and F435W. The line indicates a ratio of unity. Right: Relation between effective radii\nand total radii of the knots for which we could estimate the total size value with an uncertainty\nof less than 50%. The fit for the data is shown at the bottom-right corner. Both axes are in log\nscale.\n\nSize measurements were performed by fitting radial Gaussians, technique that has\nbeen successfully used in other works (e.g., Surace et al. 1998; Whitmore et al. 1993).\nThe measured radial profile of a knot (compact region of star formation) corresponds to\nthe convolved profile of the PSF with the intrinsic profile of the knot. We then fitted\n2D-Gaussians to each knot and to foreground stars in the image (to computep\nthe PSF pro2 \u2212 \u03c32\nfile). We can estimate the \u03c3 for the intrinsic profile of the knot as \u03c3 = \u03c3m\nP SF ,\nwhere \u03c3m corresponds to the \u03c3 of the measured profile (average of \u03c3 in the x and y direction) and \u03c3P SF to that of the PSF profile. An effective radius, reff, was derived as the half\nvalue of the full width half maximum derived from the computed \u03c3 (FWHM=2.354\u03c3).\n45\n\nFWHM\n\n\fChap. I\n\nSample Selection, Dataset and Data Treatment\n\nNote that reff defined in this study does not strictly correspond to the half-light radius\n(which is the common definition of reff), since the light profile of the globular clusters and\nyoung massive clusters detected in the Milky way and in other galaxies is not necessarily\nGaussian. However, given the fact that the distance of 80% of the systems is larger than\n100 Mpc (distance at which the linear resolution of our data is about 20 pc per pixel) we\ndo not expect to measure resolved sizes as small as the typical size of YMCs (typically,\nreff < 20 pc; Whitmore et al. 1999). Sizes of globular clusters in the Milky Way are\neven slightly smaller. Therefore, it is not worth using more robust methods (e.g., Larsen\n1999) that better characterize the light profile of the source, and where the derived reff is\ncloser to the half-light radius. The main interest here is the relative changes in the sizes\nof the knots among the different systems.\nThe rms scatter around the 1:1 line in Fig. I.6 (left) is about 30%, from 3 pc to 90\npc for knots with sizes of 10 and 300 pc, respectively. This should give a reasonable\nestimate of the uncertainty in the measurement of reff . Differential extinction, which is\nwavelength dependent, is also responsible for part of the scatter. Then, under similar\nlocal background conditions, knots look a bit more extended when observed with the\nF814W filter. Another source of uncertainty comes from the young population. In\nfact, faint young blue knots easily detectable in the F435W image but with low S/N\nratio in the F814W image will look more extended in the blue ones. In any case, this\nmeasurement is unlikely to be affected by the nebular emission-lines (i.e., H\u03b1, H\u03b2 or\noxygen lines), since in the vast majority of the systems these lines do not significantly\ncontaminate the HST filters used in this study (see Fig. I.3).\nTo assess the minimum size we can achieve by using this technique we estimated\nwhich would be the Gaussian that, convolved with that of the PSF profile, would give\na total FWHM = FWHMP SF + 3STD, where STD gives the standard deviation of the\nFWHM distribution measured for all the stars that were used to compute the PSF profile.\nFor the closest systems we are typically limited to about 10 pc and for the farthest\nsystems, 40 pc.\nThe method described is appropriate to estimate reff of cluster-like objects with a size\nsimilar to the PSF. If we want to compute reff of a galaxy, whose light profile is normally\nvery different, other techniques should be applied. Appendix B describes the procedure\nfollowed to estimate reff of the galaxies by fitting their 2D profile.\n\n3.1.2\n\nTotal Size\n\nThe total size of the knots was obtained from the F814W images, since this filter is\nless affected by extinction than the other photometric filter in this study and therefore\nis more convenient to measure the radial extent of the light of the knots. We derived the\nedge of the knots at the point where the surface brightness (\u03a3), as a function of radius,\nequals that of the local background. To determine this point, we assumed that the knots\n46\n\n\f3 - General Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis Techniques\nare circular and measured the surface brightness in concentric rings, as done in Bastian\net al. (2005a).\nThe size of the knots was then derived by fitting the radial profile of the light with a\npower-law of the form \u03a3 \u221d r\u2212\u03b2 . This function follows the data quite well and corresponds\nto the projected density profile of a knot with \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212(\u03b2+1) , where \u03c1 is in units of M\u2299 pc\u22123\n(Bastian et al. 2005a). For slightly-resolved knots the PSF may be dominating the size\nmeasured. We then estimated the half-light radius of the PSF and applied the ratio\nknot\nPSF\nreff\n/ reff\nto the derived size.\nOwing to the complex stellar structure of (U)LIRGs, a large fraction of them involved\nin an interaction process, the light profile of the local background of the galaxies is\nusually very steep and irregular. Thus, the application of this method is somewhat\nlimited. Furthermore, the size of the unresolved knots cannot be derived. We could\nmeasure reliable sizes, with an uncertainty of less than 50%, for a third of the detected\nknots. However, we could estimate the total size of the remaining knots (as long as they\nare resolved) by using the relation found between reff and the total size (see Fig. I.6,\nright).\n\n3.2\n\nStellar Population Models\n\nIn this thesis we make use of single stellar population synthesis models in order to\nderive the age, mass and extinction of the stellar populations under some circumstances\n(e.g., when the colors are so blue that the degeneracy of the tracks is minimized significantly; or when we know the population is young because H\u03b1 emission is detected). If\nwe know the age and the mass of the stellar population we can also use these models the\nother way round and derive the emission we would measure with the broad-band filters,\nas done in Chapter III.\nTo perform this kind of analysis, two independent stellar population models were considered: the evolutionary synthesis code Starburst99 v5.1 (Leitherer et al. 1999; V\u00e1zquez\n& Leitherer 2005) and the code by Maraston (2005). The former is optimized for young\npopulations and also models the contribution due to ionized gas whereas the latter gives\na rigorous treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase,\nwhich is relevant within the interval 0.1-1 Gyr. In both cases we assumed instantaneous\nburst models with a Kroupa initial mass function (Kroupa 2002) over the range 0.1120 M\u2299 and solar metallicity. These models are normalized to 106 M\u2299 . Mass estimates\nmust be multiplied by a factor of 1.56 if the Salpeter IMF is considered.\nThe evolutionary tracks (up to 1 Gyr) using both SB99 and Maraston SEDs are presented in Fig. I.7. At very young ages (log \u03c4 . 6.5) the nebular continuum, which is considered in SB99, reddens the colors by up to 0.6 mag. From \u03c4 & 50 Myr (log \u03c4 = 7.7) up to\n1 Gyr the differences between both models also become significant. However, regardless\n47\n\nSB99\n\nIMF\n\n\fChap.

The curves are normalized to 106 M\u2299 . Filled circles, stars and triangles\nindicate the age in the SB99 track in steps of 1 Myr (from 1 to 9 Myr), 10 Myr (from 10 to 90\nMyr) and 100 Myr (from 100 to 1000 Myr), respectively. Open symbols show the same for the\nMaraston tracks. The de-reddening vector (AV = 1 mag), computed using the curve of Calzetti\net al.(2000), is shown in both plots.\n\nof the model used, the degeneracy in color within the range MF 435W -MF 814W = 0.6-1.4 is\nconsiderable for two reasons: stellar populations with ages within the interval 50-500 Myr\nhave the same MF 435W -MF 814W color in the range 0.6-0.8; the Red Super Giant population\nreddens the tracks at ages \u03c4 \u223c 7-14 Myr, when this population dominates the luminosity,\nhence making it indistinguishable from a population of up to \u03c4 \u223c 1 Gyr. Considering\nthis, there is a clear age degeneracy for the color interval MF 435W -MF 814W = 0.6-1.4.\nSince the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) depends on the age of the population, this age degeneracy translates into an uncertainty of about a factor of 100 in the mass estimates.\nHence, although the ignorance of the extinction contributes as well, the age degeneracy\nrepresents the primary source of uncertainty.\n\nEW\n\nIf we have access to spectroscopic measurements, we can use the SB99 models to\nconstrain the properties of recent episodes of star formation. It is widely known that\nH\u03b1 emission can be used to constrain the properties of recent episodes of star formation. In fact, if the population for which we want to estimate the mass is young (i.e.,\n\u03c4 < 10 Myr), the H\u03b1 emission line and its equivalent width are generally used to con48\n\n\f3 - General Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis Techniques\n\n40\n\n4\nAV=1\n\nlog (EW(H\u03b1) \u00c5)\n\nlog (FH\u03b1 ( erg s\u22121) )\n\n41\n\n39\n38\n37\n36\n6.4\n\n6.6 6.8 7.0\nlog (\u03c4(yr))\n\n7.2\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n6.4\n\n6.6 6.8 7.0\nlog (\u03c4 (yr))\n\n7.2\n\nFigure I.8: Left: H\u03b1 evolution of young population, according to two SB99 instantaneous\nbursts of Z = 0.020 (solid line) and Z = 0.008 (dashed line), and the same IMF and mass as\nin Fig. I.7.

The\ninitial mass function and the processes that undergo any object once it is formed defines\nthe shape of the LF. As mentioned in the previous Chapter, for the young knots and\nclusters observed in merging systems and other environments, the LF is well described\nas a power-law distribution: dN \u221d L\u2212\u03b1\n\u03bb dL\u03bb or the equivalent form using magnitudes,\n\u03b2M\u03bb\ndN \u221d 10\ndM\u03bb , L\u03bb and M\u03bb being the luminosity and magnitude respectively and N\nbeing the number of clusters. The slopes in both equations are related as \u03b1 = 2.5 \u00d7 \u03b2 + 1.\nThe shape of the LF has usually been determined by fitting an equal sized bin distribution. Instead, we used a method described and tested in Ma\u00edz-Apell\u00e1niz & \u00dabeda\n49\n\n\fChap. I\n\nSample Selection, Dataset and Data Treatment\n\n(2005), based on D'Agostino & Stephens (1986). It is based on using bins variable in\nwidth, such that every bin contains approximately an equal number of knots. Hence,\nthe same statistical weight is assigned to each bin and biases are minimized. Haas et\nal. (2008) showed that this method is more accurate than those based on fitting an\nequal sized bin distribution. The number of bins (Nbins ) is different for all samples and is\nrelated to the total number of objects in the samples. On the basis of the prescription in\nMa\u00edz-Apell\u00e1niz & \u00dabeda (2005), we computed the number of bins using the expression:\n2/5\nNbins = 2NC + 15, where NC corresponds to the total number of knots.\nTo properly fit the slope of the LF a completeness limit must be set and the fit must be\ndone until this limit. When possible, complenetness limits were derived for each galaxy.\nAppendix A describes in detail the method used to compute the completeness limits. The\nfit was performed on the whole range from the 90% completeness limit to the brightest\nknot in the sample, thus the slope of the LF might be sensitive to an incompleteness of\nabout 10%. Using a higher completeness limit cuts off a large number of the knots. By\ncorrecting for incompleteness at the 90 and 95% limits the LF would become steeper (we\nunderestimate the slope of the LF if we do not correct for incompleteness). The typical\nvalue of the underestimate of the slope of the LF in Haas et al. (2008) is \u2206\u03b1 . 0.1 dex\nfor the ACS F435W and F814W filters. We computed a similar value, so we adopt it\nfor this study.\nThe uncertainties associated with the fit of the LF (shown in Tables and Figures\nthroughout the thesis) should be considered lower limits since they do not take into\naccount other sources of error. We performed several tests to establish the robustness\nof the fits. When the brightest bins were dropped in the fit the values obtained for the\nslope in all cases agreed within 0.08 dex. When moving the magnitude limit higher by\n0.5 mag changes the slope generally agreed within 0.05 dex. Finally, we also explored\nhow the slope varies when performing a linear regression fit to the cumulative luminosity\ndistribution (see the third case in the Appendix in Haas et al. 2008). The variations\nhere generally agreed within 0.06 dex. Hence, combining all these effects, a more realistic\nuncertainty for the slopes of the LF that we obtained would be about 0.1 dex.\nThe determination of the slope of the mass function was done following the same\nprocedure. In this case, the completeness limit was assumed to be the peak of the mass\ndistribution.\n\n3.4\n\nRelative HST -IFS Astrometry\n\nIn Chapter IV the photometric images and spectral maps are combined, different\ndatasets with different angular resolution. For an adequate comparison between both\ndata sets, it is necessary to align the images to the same reference system. To that end,\nthe high spatial resolution HST images were degraded and compared with the VIMOS\nand INTEGRAL red continuum. Taking advantage of their morphological resemblance,\n50\n\n\f3 - General Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis Techniques\n\nFigure I.9: Left: Iras 08355-4944 as observed with the HST ACS F814W filter, where\nthe structural details are clearly visible, provided by the high spatial resolution. Right: The\nprevious HST image convolved with a Gaussian to simulate the atmosphere + telescope effect\nis shown in color. The contours represent the VIMOS red continuum close to the H\u03b1 line.\n\nwe could establish the position of the spectral-line maps with respect to the HST images\nwith an uncertainty of about half a spaxel (i.e., about 0.3\u2032\u2032 for VIMOS maps and about\n0.4\u2032\u2032 for INTEGRAL maps). An example is shown in Fig. I.9.\n3.5\n\nMetallicity Calibrators\n\nAbundances are usually estimated using empirical methods based on the intensities\nof several optical lines. The most popular methods are the widely used R23 (TorresPeimbert et al. 1989) and the S23 (V\u00edlchez & Esteban 1996) calibrators. However, both\nmethods make use of emission lines that our spectral range does not cover. We used\ninstead the N2 calibrator proposed by Denicolo et al. (2002) and the empirical diagrams\nof Edmuns & Pagel (Edmunds & Pagel 1984). The former is based on the ratio between\nthe [NII]\u03bb6584 and the H\u03b1 emission lines and the latter relates the ratio [OIII]\u03bb4959 +\n[OIII]\u03bb5007 to H\u03b2 to the oxygen abundance, parametrized as in Duc & Mirabel (1998):\n\n[N2] :\n\n12 + log(O/H) = 9.12(\u00b10.05) + 0.73(\u00b10.10) \u00d7 log\n\n[Edmunds] : 12 + log(O/H) = \u22120.68 \u00d7 log\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n[NII]\u03bb6584\nH\u03b1\n\n[OIII]\u03bb4959 + [OIII]\u03bb5007\nH\u03b2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n(I.2)\n\n+ 8.74 (I.3)\n\n51\n\n\fChap. I\n\nSample Selection, Dataset and Data Treatment\n\nGiven the spectral range of the VIMOS data, metallicity determinations were only\npossible using the N2 calibrator for systems observed with this instrument. The typical uncertainties of the determined metallicities are about 0.2 dex. For the galaxies\nobserved with INTEGRAL, given these uncertainties, the differences between both indicators (usually within 0.2 dex) are not relevant, and thus we adopted the average value\nof both determinations.\n\n3.6\n3.6.1\n\nMass Determinations\nStellar Masses\n\nThe flux measured with broad-band filters is usually used for mass determinations of\nstellar populations. In this study, however, only two filters are used and degeneracy issues\ncan make these estimates very much uncertain. However, under some circumstances (i.e.,\nMF 435W -MF 814W < 0.5) a first-order estimate of the age of an instantaneous burst can be\nachieved, according to the SB99 models (see Fig. I.7 in Section 3.2). Assuming a single\nburst, once the age of the stellar population is known, the mass-to-light ratio (M/L)\ngiven by the models is used to derive the stellar mass of the population that dominates\nthe broad-band emission (in our case under the assumption that only one population\ndominates such emission).\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2, the H\u03b1 emission can be used to constrain the properties\nof recent episodes of star formation (see Fig. I.8). Alghough the EW does not depend\non the mass of the population and is not affected by internal extinction, an underlying\nold population which does not contribute significantly to the broad-band filters (i.e., the\nACS F435W and F814W ), if considerably more massive than the young population\n(i.e., more massive than one order of magnitude), can affect the H\u03b1 continuum and\nconsequently the value of the measured EW. Therefore, the age determined by using the\nEW is normally assumed to be an upper-limit to the real age of the young component\nin a hypothetical case of a composite stellar population (young and old). As in the case\nof using only broad-band filters, once the age is known, the mass-to-light ratio given by\nthe models is applied to derive the young stellar mass of the population.\n\n3.6.2\n\nDynamical Masses\n\nThe difference between dynamical (i.e., stars + gas + dark matter) and stellar masses\nrelies on the fact that the first is derived taking into account the gravitational field,\n52\n\n\f3 - General Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis Techniques\nwhereas the latter is obtained based on the integrated light assuming a mass-to-light ratio.\nThe dynamical mass of a bound system can be derived using the virial theorem, under the\nfollowing assumptions: (i) the system is spherically symmetric; (ii) it is gravitationally\n2\nbound; and (iii) it has an isotropic velocity distribution [\u03c3 2 (total)=3\u00d7\u03c3LOS\n], where \u03c3LOS\nis the line-of-sight velocity dispersion.\nAssuming virialization, the dynamical of a stellar system is given by two parameters:\nits velocity dispersion (\u03c3) and its half mass radius (rhm ). Depending on the object under\nstudy (cluster- or galaxy-like) different relations are typically used:\n\nMdyn /M\u2299 = m106 rhm \u00d7 \u03c3 2\n\nMdyn /M\u2299 = \u03b7\n\n2\nref f \u00d7 \u03c3LOS\nG\n\n(I.4)\n\n(I.5)\n\nEquation I.4 is generally used for galaxy-/ellipsoidal-like objects. The parameter rhm\nis given in kpc, \u03c3 in km s\u22121 and the factor m is a dimensionless function of the assumed\nmass distribution and ranges from 1.4 for a King stellar mass distribution that adequately\nrepresents ellipticals (Bender et al. 1992; Tacconi et al. 2002) to 1.75 for a polytropic\nsphere with a density index covering a range of values (Spitzer 1987) and 2.09 for a de\nVaucoluleurs mass distribution (Combes et al. 1995).\nEquation I.5 is generally used for cluster-like objects. Here, reff is given in pc, \u03c3LOS\nin km s\u22121 and the gravitational constant G=4.3\u00d710\u22123 pc M\u2299 \u22121 (km s\u22121 )2 (Spitzer\n1987) and \u03b7 = 9.75 for a wide range of light profiles. However, some studies have shown\nthat \u03b7 is not a constant, and can vary with time (\u03b7 \u223c 3 \u2212 10), depending on, for example, the degree of mass segregation and the binary fraction of the cluster (Fleck et al.\n2006; Kouwenhoven & de Grijs 2008). Since we do not have that information we use\n\u03b7 = 9.75.\nThe half-mass radius is not an observable and cannot be measured directly. It has\nto be inferred indirectly by measuring the half-light radius (reff ). The broadening of\nthe emission lines is produced by a few fundamental effects, as described by Melnick et\nal. (1999): mainly thermal broadening, virial broadening, natural broadening and local\ndynamical effects as expanding shells, filaments and outflows. Once the widths of the\nprincipal components (\u03c3obs ) were measured and corrected for instrumental broadening\n(\u03c3ins ), additional corrections had to be applied for natural (\u03c3n ) and thermal (\u03c3th ) broadening to obtain what we denote as the virial width according to the following relation:\n\u03c3=\n\nq\n\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c3obs\n\u2212 \u03c3n2 \u2212 \u03c3th\n\u2212 \u03c3ins\n\n(I.6)\n53\n\n\fChap. I\n\nSample Selection, Dataset and Data Treatment\n\nThe natural broadening is a constant for hydrogen and corresponds to 3 kms\u22121 (O'dell\n& Townsley 1988; Rozas et al. 2006a). For HII regions with temperatures of 5000 K,\n10000 K, and 15000 K, Osterbrock (1989) provides Doppler widths of \u03c3th = 6.4, 9.1, and\n11.1 kms\u22121 , respectively. In the absence of the temperature information for our sample,\na uniform value of \u03c3th = 9.1 kms\u22121 was adopted. Given the uncertainties of \u03c3obs (higher\nthan 5-10 kms\u22121 in our case), the ignorance of the temperature is not worrisome.\n\n54\n\n\fChapter\n\nII\n\nOptically-selected Compact\nStar-Forming Regions in (U)LIRGs\nOverview\nThis Chapter presents a comprehensive characterization of the\ngeneral properties (luminosity functions, mass, size, ages, etc)\nof optically-selected compact stellar objects (knots) in a representative sample of 32 low-z Luminous and Ultraluminouos\nInfrared Galaxies. These properties are important to understand their formation and evolution in these systems, which\nrepresent the most extreme cases of starbursts in the low-z\nUniverse. Specifically, we investigate how they depend on the\ninfrared luminosity of the system and on the interaction phase\nit is undergoing. We also investigate how similar these knots\nare to clumpy structures in galaxies at high-z.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe observation of young and massive compact clusters in different environments\n(e.g., Meurer et al. 1995; Larsen & Richtler 1999; Whitmore et al. 1999, 2007; Weilbacher\net al. 2000; Gallagher et al. 2010; Mullan et al. 2011) has provided important clues to\nunderstand the formation and evolutionary processes in interacting systems. With masses\nof 104 \u2212 106 M\u2299 and a median size in terms of effective radius around 3.5 pc, their light\nfollow the same luminosity function (LF ) in the optical in a wide range of galactic\nenvironments, a power-law (\u03c8(L)dL \u221d L\u2212\u03b1 dL) with an index of \u03b1 = 2. Yet, there is\nsome controversy, since the range is rather large depending on the study (see General\nIntroduction, Section 2.1). These clusters associate in star-forming complexes, which\nrepresent the largest units of star formation in a galaxy (Efremov 1995). The observation\nof these objects (e.g., Whitmore et al. 1999; Bastian et al. 2005a) has provided a deeper\n55\n\n\fChap. II Optically-selected Compact Star-Forming Regions in (U)LIRGs\nknowledge on the hierarchy of the star formation in embedded groupings.\nAlthough much effort has been made to understand the star formation and evolutionary processes in interacting systems, little is known for Luminous (LIRGs) and Ultraluminous (ULIRGs ) Infrared Galaxies, which represent the most extreme cases of\nstarbursts and interactions in our nearby Universe. Given the significant contribution\nof these galaxies to the star formation rate density at z \u223c 1-2 (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al.\n2005; Caputi et al. 2007) and their resemblance with sub-millimeter galaxies at higher\nredshifts (Smail et al. 1997; Blain et al. 2002; Frayer et al. 2004), their properties can\nalso have important cosmological implications. They are natural laboratories for probing\nhow star formation is affected by major rearrangements in the structure and kinematics\nof galactic disks. Establishing the general properties (luminosity functions, mass, size,\nages, etc) of the compact stellar objects in (U)LIRGs as a function of luminosity and interaction phase can provide relevant information in order to understand the mechanisms\nthat govern the star formation and evolution in these systems. It is not known either\nwhether the processes that (U)LIRGs undergo produce stellar objects similar or very\ndifferent in terms of size or luminosity than in less luminous (non-) interacting galaxies.\nIn fact, previous studies of compact stellar structures in (U)LIRGs were focused only\non small samples, mostly with low angular resolution ground-based imaging (Surace\net al. 1998; Surace et al. 2000), or on detailed multi-frequency studies of compact stellar\nobjects in individual galaxies (Surace et al. 2000; D\u00edaz-Santos et al. 2007). Thus, no\nstudy has been done so far on a representative sample of luminous infrared galaxies\ncovering the different phases of the interaction process as well as the entire LIRG and\nULIRG luminosity range.\nThis Chapter presents the first attempt at obtaining an homogeneous and statistically\nsignificant study of the photometric properties (magnitudes, colors, sizes and luminosity\nfunction) of optically-selected compact stellar objects found in these systems as a function\nof infrared luminosity, morphology (i.e., interaction phase) and radial distance to the\nnucleus of the galaxy. For this study we make use of the photometric B - and I -band\nACS images (Chapter I, Section 2.1) of the representative 32 (U)LIRGs that comprise\nour sample (Chapter I, Section 1.1). The detected stellar objects, some of them identified\nas Super Star Cluster candidates for the closest galaxies (i.e., at DL . 60 Mpc) and most\nof them as cluster complexes further away, will be referred to as \"knots\".\nSpecifically, the Chapter is organized as follows: we first describe the procedure followed to detected the knots under study in Section 2; we then characterize the bias that\nwe will encounter throughout the Chapter caused by the distribution of distances of the\ngalaxies in our sample, distance effects, in Section 3; in Section 4 the main photometric\nproperties of the identified knots are presented; next, we characterize these properties as\na function of the infrared luminosity of the system in Section 5; the characterization as a\nfunction of the interaction phase is developed in Section 6; Section 7 compares the properties of the detected knots with star-forming clumps in high-z galaxies; finally, Section 8\ngives a brief summary of the most relevant results and the main conclusions.\n56\n\n\f2 - Source Detection and Photometry\n\n2\n\nSource Detection and Photometry\n\nCompact regions with high surface brightness (knots hereafter) that are usually bluer\nthan the underlying galaxy were identified for each galaxy. They were detected inside a box that encloses each system including the diffuse emission observed in the red\nband. They appear similar to the bright blue knots found in interacting galaxies like\nin NCG 7252 (Whitmore et al. 1993), NGC 4038/39 (Whitmore & Schweizer 1995),\nsome ULIRGs (Surace et al. 1998), M51 (Bik et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2005 and Arp284\n(Peterson et al. 2009). These knots were identified on the basis of having a flux above\nthe 5\u03c3 detection level of the local background. Owing to the irregular and distorted\nmorphologies for most of the systems, we performed a two step analysis to identify the\ncompact regions: we first smoothed the image, averaging in a box of 30x30 pixels, and\nsubtracted this smoothed image from the original one in order to make a first rough\nlocal background subtraction; we then ran SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) on the\nresulting image to detect the knots. Given the steepness of the light profile of the local\nbackground in the inner regions and its larger deviation with respect to outer regions,\nan appropriate background subtraction was not always possible and some inner knots\nwere never detected. Thus, visual inspection was needed afterward to include some inner\nknots and also to eliminate some spurious detections.\nOnce the knots were detected, all photometric measurements were done using the\ntasks PHOT and POLYPHOT within the IRAF (Tody 1993) environment. We first\nidentified the point-like sources against the extended ones, since the photometry of the\nformer requires aperture corrections. We fitted the knots with a Moffat profile, and\nthose with a FWHM . 1.5\u00d7FHWM the profile of the stars in the field were considered\nas point-like knots. Note that although they actually consist of point-like and slightly\nresolved objects, they are considered as point-like objects here just to assign an aperture\nradius, since both require aperture corrections when the photometry is done. Once their\nsize was derived via psf fitting (see Chapter I, Section 3.1) we differentiated between\nresolved and unresolved knots.\nAperture photometry with a 3 pixel aperture radius (0.15\u2032\u2032 ) was performed for the\npoint-like knots. For the resolved knots, we used aperture radii between 5 and 7 pixels\n(0.25-0.35\u2032\u2032), depending on when the radial profile reached background levels. The 7-pixel\napertures were large enough to include practically all the light from the knot but small\nenough to avoid confusion with other sources and to avoid adding more noise to the\nmeasurements. In some cases, the irregular shape of the knots demanded the use of\npolygonal apertures. In some cases, especially for knots belonging to the most distant\ngalaxies, the polygonal apertures were larger than 7 pixels. Estimates of the underlying\nbackground flux were made by using the mode of flux values measured in an 8-13 pixel\nannulus centered on the computed centroid with POLYPHOT, and eliminating the 10%\nof the extreme values at each side of the flux background distribution (e.g., if there is a\nnearby knot it adds spurious flux at the bright end of the distribution). Most of the knots\n57\n\n\fChap. II Optically-selected Compact Star-Forming Regions in (U)LIRGs\nare apart from each other by more than 7 pixels (0.35\u2032\u2032 ), hence confusion does not seem\nto be a serious problem, though in the inner regions of few systems (IRAS 04315-0840,\nIRAS 15206+3342 and IRAS 20550+1656) there is some overcrowding.\nPhotometric calibrations were performed following Sirianni et al. (2005) for the\nACS images and Holtzman et al. (1995) for the WFPC2 images (hereafter calibration\nreference papers), and magnitudes computed in VEGA system, as explained in Chapter I, Section 2.1.1. Correction for charge transfer efficiency (CTE) was needed in the\nWFPC2 photometry but was not applied to the ACS photometry, since tests in some\nimages showed that the effect was less than 1% for the faintest regions identified. Aperture corrections were considered for the point-like knots. To that end, we performed the\nphotometry for isolated stars in the field (from a few to about a hundred, depending\non the image) in the same way as we did for the point-like knots, then a second time\nbut using a 10 pixel radius. The ratio of both values gives us an aperture correction up\nto 10 pixels. From 10 pixels to an infinite aperture radius the values in the calibration\nreference papers were taken, since the PSF profile from 10 pixels on is stable enough regardless of the observing conditions. Typical aperture corrections were about 0.3 and 0.2\nmag for the F814W and F435W filters, respectively. Using the deviation of the different\naperture corrections computed with stars in the field we estimated the uncertainty due\nto the aperture corrections to be of the order of 0.05-0.1 mag in both filters. Typical\nphotometric uncertainties for all the knots lie between 0.05 and 0.15 mag, depending on\nthe brightness of the knot. According to the completeness test performed in Appendix A,\nthe systematics affect both filters nearly equally, thus the typical uncertainty in color is\nbetween 0.10 and 0.20 mag.\nWe corrected all the magnitudes for reddening due to our galaxy taking the values directly from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), computed following Schlegel\net al. (1998). Apart from this, no internal reddening corrections have been applied to\nthe magnitudes reported in this chapter.\nInitially, we probably detected old globular clusters, super star clusters, star complexes, HII regions, foreground stars, background objects, etc. Some of them were rejected\nafter the photometry was made. Foreground stars were mostly easily identified by their\nhigh brightness and red colors and their status as point-like objects. The fields in systems\nat low galactic latitudes (IRAS 08355-4944, IRAS 09022-3615 and IRAS 12116-5615) are\nso crowded with foreground stars that some may still contaminate the photometric sample knots after rejection, especially if a faint foreground star lies within the inner regions\nof the galaxy. No cluster/knot with color MF 435W -MF 814W & 2.2 fits in stellar population\nmodels for an extinction-free starburst at redshift z \u223c 0. Since we do not expect much\nextinction in the outer parts of the galaxies (usually where we do not see diffuse emission\nfrom the galaxy in the red band), all the red knots outside the diffuse emission of the\nsystems are likely to be background objects and were also rejected. After these rejections\na total of 2961 knots were considered under study.\nThe nuclei of the systems were identified using the H -band images and with the\n58\n\n\f3 - Distance Dependence of the Photometric Properties\n\n\u2212\u2212 Systems at < DL > = 99 Mpc \u2212\u2212\n\n0.15\n\n< MF814W > =\u221211.36\n\nFraction\n\nN=1360\n\n0.10\n\n\u03b1=1.71\u00b10.04\n\n0.20\n\n< rF814W\n> = 25 pc\neff\n\n< MF435W \u2212 MF814W > =1.13\n\n0.4\n\n0.15\n\n0.3\n0.10\n0.2\n\n0.05\n0.05\n0.00\n\n0.1\n\n0.00\n\u221218\n\n\u221214 \u221210\nMF814W\n\n0.0\n\u22121 0 1 2 3 4 5\nMF435W \u2212 MF814W\n\n0\n\n100 200 300 400\nrF814W\neff\n\n\u2212\u2212 Simulated systems at < DL > = 258 Mpc \u2212\u2212\n\n0.15\n\n< MF814W > =\u221212.45\n\nFraction\n\nN=839\n\n0.10\n\n\u03b1=1.56\u00b10.03\n\n0.20\n\n< rF814W\n> = 78 pc\neff\n\n< MF435W \u2212 MF814W > =1.12\n\n0.4\n\n0.15\n\n0.3\n0.10\n0.2\n\n0.05\n0.05\n0.00\n\n0.1\n\n0.00\n\u221218\n\n\u221214 \u221210\nMF814W\n\n0.0\n\u22121 0 1 2 3 4 5\nMF435W \u2212 MF814W\n\n0\n\n100 200 300 400\nrF814W\neff\n\nFigure II.1: Photometric properties for real (top) and simulated (bottom) data.

The\nidentification of the true nucleus is of relevance in the derivation of the projected distances\nof the knots with respect to the closest nucleus, to properly study the spatial distribution\nof these knots.\n\n3\n\nDistance Dependence of the Photometric Properties\n\nBefore going any further, we first consider a selection effect that we can encounter\nwhen studying the photometric properties of the knots in (U)LIRGs located at different\ndistances. The classical Malmquist bias is caused by the fact that systematically brighter\nobjects are observed as distance (and volume) increases, as a result of a combination of\nthe selection and the intrinsic scatter of absolute magnitudes.\nOur sample is affected by this bias, since the systems are located at different distances\n59\n\n\fChap. II Optically-selected Compact Star-Forming Regions in (U)LIRGs\n(from 65 to 560 Mpc). As the system stands further, the faintest knots become undetected\nand we can only see the bright ones. Furthermore, for the same angular resolution the\nspatial resolution decreases linearly with distance, and therefore the knots that we detect\nat large distances can consist of associations of knots instead of individual knots as those\nobserved in less distant systems. Thus, larger sizes are computed. Though this is not a\ncomplete sample, Fig. I.1 in Chapter I shows that in general more distant galaxies have\nhigher infrared luminosity. The same tendency is seen if the galaxies from the IRAS\nRevisited Galaxy Sample (RBGS, Sanders et al. 2003) are taken. This effect has to be\nsubtracted in order to observe reliable intrinsic differences between systems at different\ndistances.\nWe divided the sample in three LIR intervals, so as to study the dependence of the photometric properties with the total infrared luminosity of the system (see Section 5). To\nasses how the photometric properties depend on the distance of the system a simulation\nwas performed. The median distance of the low luminosity interval (LIR < 11.65) corresponds to 99 Mpc, whereas that of ULIRGs (the high luminosity interval) is 258 Mpc.\nHence, for this sample ULIRGs are located a factor of 2.6 further away than the low\nluminous LIRGs. We simulated the light emission of galaxies within the first LIR interval\nas if they were a factor of 2.6 further, obtaining the same median distance as in ULIRGs.\nTo that end, the HST images were convolved with a Gaussian at the resolution of the\nPSF at the new distance of each galaxy and re-binned in order to have the same \"pixel\nsize\" at that distance. Using foreground stars we computed a multiplication factor for\neach image in order to preserve the flux, since the flux of the point-like objects must be\npreserved. Then, photometry was carried out as in the original images, with circular and\nin some cases polygonal apertures.\nThe results of the simulation for the F814W filter are presented in Fig. II.1. The\nmagnitudes and the sizes increase by about 1.1 mag (a factor of 2.8 in flux) and by a\nfactor of 3, respectively. The number of detected objects drops by about a factor of 1.6.\nTherefore, in the simulated image, individual knots are associations of knots from the\noriginal one. As a result, not only do the sizes become larger, but its distribution also\nflattens. The median values of the reff distribution in the simulation are 25 and 78 pc\nfor the real and simulated knots, respectively.\nThe flattening of the luminosity function (from \u03b1 = 1.71 to 1.56) is also expected,\nsince as the knots are artificially grouped due to angular resolution effects the bright tail\nof the LF starts to get more populated. Another expected result of the simulation is that\nthe color distribution does not change significantly.\nIf we consider the spatial distribution of the knots (inner and outer knots, with projected distances of less and more than 2.5 kpc to the nucleus, respectively), some changes\nare also observed; the ratio of inner to outer knots shifts from 0.7 to 0.5. Owing to the\nhigher surface brightness and steeper background profile in the inner regions, when convolving the images to get lower linear resolution, a large fraction of inner knots are diluted\nby the local background, in contrast to a lower dilution degree in the outermost regions.\n60\n\n\f4 - General Properties of the Knots\nFurthermore, more grouping is expected in the innermost regions, where there is more\ncrowding, hence also losing a larger number of inner knots when compared with those\nlocated in the outer regions.\n\n4\n\nGeneral Properties of the Knots\n\nOwing to the high angular resolution and sensitivity of the ACS camera, and to the\ndefinition of our large sample, covering a wider LIR range than previous studies focused\nonly on ULIRGs (Surace et al. 1998; Surace et al. 2000), we have detected close to\n3000 knots. This is more than a factor of ten larger than in previous investigations and\nallows us to carry out a statistical study exploring the different physical properties of\nthe knots over the entire LIRG and ULIRG luminosity range. We have then performed\nthe photometry in both F435W and F814W filters for these knots. For this study we\nconsider the knots with positive detection in both filters. The objects identified as the\nnuclei were not, since many of them are believed to be contaminated by an AGN (see\nChapter I, Table I.1, and the references regarding the spectral class).\n\n4.1\n\nMagnitudes and Colors. Average Values\n\nThe knots detected in our sample of luminous infrared galaxies have observed\nF814W and F435W absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for internal extinction) in the\n-20 . MF 814W . -9 and -19.5 . MF 435W . -7 range, respectively, while colors cover the\n-1 . MF 435W -MF 814W . 5 range (see Fig. II.2). The corresponding median magnitudes\nare < MF 814W >=-11.96 and < MF 435W >=-10.84. The median color of the knots corresponds to < MF 435W -MF 814W > = 1.0, which clearly indicates the presence of a young\nstellar population (about half of the knots have colors bluer than that value). By contrast, the mean color of the diffuse local background light, which traces the old stellar\npopulation in the host galaxies, is 1.72, consistent with the typical colors measured in\nspirals (B-I=1.80; Lu et al. 1993).\nA small fraction of the knots (2% of the total) show extreme red colors\n(MF 435W -MF 814W = 3 or redder), likely tracing regions with very high internal obscuration, usually located in the more central regions (Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006; Garc\u00edaMar\u00edn et al. 2009a). If the stellar population in these knots was dominated by young\nstars (i.e., \u03c4 \u223c 10 Myr), the extinction could be as high as AV = 5-7 mag. Heavily obscured young clusters with AV = 5-10 mag have also been detected in the optical in less\nluminous interacting systems like the Antennae (e.g., clusters S1_1 and 2000_1, whose\nextinction was computed with the aid of infrared spectroscopy; Mengel et al. 2008).\n61\n\n\fChap.

Radial Distribution\n\nTo understand the star formation in luminous infrared galaxies, it is important to\ninvestigate whether the observed properties of the knots (magnitudes, colors and sizes)\ndo show dependence on the galactocentric distance. The spatial distribution of the knots\nis shown in Fig. II.3, where their sizes are related to their absolute magnitude and their\ncolor to the photometric color MF 435W -MF 814W . About one-third of the knots lie within\na projected galactocentric radius of 2.5 kpc while this fraction increases up to about\ntwo-thirds within a radius of 5 kpc. Thus, a substantial fraction of the knots are located\nclose to the nucleus at distances of less than 5 kpc. Also, as can be seen in the figure,\nthey mainly represent the population with the reddest colors, likely indicative of higher\ninternal extinction, although an older population can not be excluded. Yet, there is also\nan external population of knots (10.8% of the total) at distances of more than 10 kpc\nand up to 40 kpc, located along the tidal tails and at the tip of these tails. Most of\nthese external knots are blue (MF 435W -MF 814W < 1), and some (5.7%) are very luminous\n(MF 435W < -12.5), suggesting the presence of young massive (M > 105 M\u2299 in young\nstars) objects in the outer parts of these systems. Examples of these knots can be seen\nat the northern tip in IRAS 23128-5919 and in IRAS 09022-3675, along the northern tail\nin IRAS 14348-1447, etc.\nThroughout the chapter, we identify the inner sample of knots as those with projected distances of less than 2.5 kpc to the closest nucleus, and the outer sample as\nthose with distances of at least 2.5 kpc. Both distributions have a significantly different\nmagnitude and color distribution (see Fig. II.2), the inner knots being 2 mag brighter\n(in the F814W filter) and 0.3 mag redder than the outer knots. These two distributions are different, and do not come from the same parent distribution according to the\nAdvanced Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (using the idl routine KSTWO; Press et al. 1992).\nFinally, the inner knots also have a larger color dispersion with a tail toward red colors.\nThis is likely the effect of having higher and patchier internal extinction in the innermost\nregions, in agreement with recent spectroscopic studies of these systems (Alonso-Herrero\net al. 2006; Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn et al. 2009a). Additionally, the brighter blue magnitudes in\nthe inner regions suggest that there must be more young star formation there than in\nthe outer field.\n\n4.3\n\nEffective Radius of the Knots\n\nThe angular resolution limit (and therefore upper sizes for unresolved knots) varies\nfrom around 10 to 40 pc, depending on the distance to the galaxy. The detected knots\ndo show a wide range of sizes ranging from unresolved (12%) to a few with very extended\nsizes (a radius of 200 pc, and up to 400 pc). The median size of the resolved knots is\n32 pc, with about 65% of them smaller than 40 pc. This is significantly larger than the\nlargest knots found in other systems, and several times larger than their mean knot radii\n63\n\nKW\n\n\fChap.

Given the distances of the galaxies in the sample\n(from about 65 Myr to more than 500 Myr) and the resolution limit, in general the knots\nidentified in our galaxies are likely aggregates of individual clusters, which would increase\ntheir (apparent) size. According to the simulations (see Section 3), the apparent size of\nthe knots changes from an average of 25 pc to 78 pc when galaxies at an average distance\nof 100 Mpc are moved at distances 2.6 times further away.\nIf we consider the sample of inner and outer knots, their distributions are similar\n(Fig. II.4), so there is no evidence of a radial dependence of the sizes at the angular\nresolution of our data.\n66\n\n\f4 - General Properties of the Knots\n\n0.5\n\nFraction\n\n0.4\n\ninner\n\nouter\n\nN=839\n\nN=1675\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0\n\n100 200 300 400\nrF814W\n(pc)\neff\n\n0\n\n100 200 300 400\nrF814W\n(pc)\neff\n\nFigure II.4: Effective radius for inner and outer knots.

Age and Mass Estimates\n\nThe determination of ages and masses of stellar populations is highly degenerate when\nusing a single color index. Moreover, uncertainty (or lack of knowledge) in the internal\nextinction in heavily obscured systems like the luminous infrared galaxies considered\nhere, adds more degeneracy (see Chapter I, Section 3.2). However, a first-order estimate\nof the age and mass can be obtained for a specific range in magnitude and colors where\ndegeneracy can be minimized. In particular, knots with colors MF 435W -MF 814W . 0.5\n(hereafter blue knots) must be young and should not be very much affected by degeneracy\nand extinction, according to the stellar population models considered in this study. They\nare bright (<MF 435W > = -11.5) and in general found in the outer regions of the systems,\nwith some exceptions such as IRAS 13536+1836 and IRAS 20550+1656 where they are\nalso detected very close to the nuclei (see Fig. II.3). A first-order estimation of the\nage and mass can be achieved for the blue knots with colors MF 435W -MF 814W . 0.5.\nIn that color interval the mass uncertainty reduces considerably down to a factor of 24 if a single stellar population is considered (see tracks in Chapter I, Fig. I.7). That\ncolor can only indicate young population (if MF 435W -MF 814W . 0.5, then \u03c4 . 30 Myr),\nhence the SB99 tracks were used for this estimation. In case of having some degeneracy\n67\n\n\fChap.

The dashed line histograms refer\nto the external knots (projected distance > 2.5 kpc).\n\n(contribution from the RSG branch), the average age was taken, in order to minimize\nthe uncertainty of the estimation.\nNote that the embedded phase of the young population in any environment can last\nfew Myr and that (U)LIRGs are known to have young population highly enshrouded in\ndust. Previous works have measured very high extinction values for clusters younger than\nabout 3 Myr in different environments (Larsen 2010). They have measured extinction\nvalues as low as AV = 0.5 mag for some clusters older than 3 Myr. Finally, it is thought\nthat the embedded phase does not last more than 5 Myr, since they have observed\nclusters older than that age which are already extinction-free. Hence, the knots for\nwhich we tried to make age and mass estimates, though young, are likely to be older\nthan 3 Myr, probably even older than 5 Myr.\nUnder these assumptions and considering all caveats above, an estimate of the age and\nmass of the blue knots was performed, assuming a single stellar population (see Fig. II.5).\nIf small extinction was present in these regions, the estimated mass would be increased by\na small amount (up to a factor of 1.8 for AV =1 mag). Some blue knots seem to be more\nmassive than the most massive old globular clusters in the Milky Way, which have masses\nup to 106 M\u2299 (Harris 2001). However, most of the blue knots have masses in the 104\n68\n\n\f4 - General Properties of the Knots\nto few 106 M\u2299 range, similar to those of giant HII regions and brightest Young Massive\nClusters in other less luminous interacting galaxies (e.g., Bastian et al. 2005b; Whitmore\net al. 1999; Mengel et al. 2008; Konstantopoulos et al. 2009). Complexes of less massive\nstar clusters can also constitute these blue knots.\nIt is interesting to mention that the blue knots in the outermost regions (i.e.,\nd > 2.5 kpc) represent the 80% of the total number, while most of the star formation is likely to be occurring within the central regions of the galaxies, as mentioned\nin Section 4.2. This suggests that in general in the outermost regions the dust extinction\nis very low in (U)LIRGs. Hence, the most obscured knots must be located close to the\nnuclei, as mentioned in the previous section and in agreement with recent spectroscopic\nstudies of these systems (Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006; Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn et al. 2009a). Part of\nthe difference between the number of blue knots in the inner and outer regions may also\nbe caused by a stronger disruption process in the central regions, as claimed by Haas et\nal. (2008), as well as by different histories of star formation of the knots in both fields.\nThe number of blue knots with estimated masses higher than 106 M\u2299 (\u223c 10%) drops\nrapidly in the external areas (the dashed line histogram in Fig. II.5). Hence, the most\nmassive young knots are also located close to the nuclei. Nevertheless, there are still some\nfew knots in the outskirts of the galaxies as massive as 106 -107 M\u2299 in young stars. Some\ncontribution in mass of older population and gas would easily boost their mass to the\ntypical dynamical mass of a dwarf galaxy (107 -109 M\u2299 ). Hence, the presence of such\nknots is very promising in the field of Tidal Dwarf Galaxies and the main motivation for\nsearching and characterizing these kind of objects in (U)LIRGs, as done in Chapter IV.\n\n4.5\n\nMass-radius Relation of the Bluest Knots\n\nIn general, the knots represent associations of star clusters created in clumps. A\nsingle giant molecular cloud (GMC ) does not usually produce a single star cluster, but\na complex of star clusters (Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1983; Bastian et al. 2005a). Thus,\nit is interesting to see how these complexes fit into the hierarchy of star formation by\nsearching for a relation between the mass and the radius of the knots. This can be done\nfor the bluest knots, for which an estimation of the mass with an uncertainty of less\nthan a factor of 4 was achieved (Section 4.4). Their radius was derived as explained in\nChapter I, Section 3.1. We could obtain reliable measurements of both values for a total\nof 294 knots, which is about a 10% of the total number of knots or about two-thirds of\nthe total number of blue knots.\nThe surface brightness profile of the bluest knots is well fitted by a power-law with\nindex \u03b2 = 0.37 \u00b1 0.33, which corresponds to (assuming sphericity) a three dimensional\ndensity profile of \u03c1 \u221d r \u03b2 , with \u03b2 = 1.37. This power-law profile is similar to that observed\nfor GMCs associated with high-mass star-forming regions (\u03b2 = 1.6 \u00b1 0.3; Pirogov 2009).\nThe similarity between the profiles in GMCs and the subsample of bluest knots suggests\n69\n\n\fChap.

The solid red line is a\npower-law fit to the data, with index \u03b3. The typical uncertainty associated with the data is\nshown in the right bottom corner.\n\nthat the amount of luminous material formed is proportional to the gas density. Obviously, measurements of the gas in molecular clouds in (U)LIRGs are needed to prove\nthis.\nAlthough with high dispersion, the bluest knots follow a mass-radius relation\n(see Fig. II.6). We fitted a function of the form M \u221d R\u03b3 , with index \u03b3 = 1.91 \u00b1 0.14.\n2\nThe size and the mass of GMCs in the Milky Way are also related, Mcloud \u221d Rcloud\n, as\na consequence of virial equilibrium (Solomon et al. 1987). This relation has also been\nfound for extragalactic GMCs (e.g., Ashman & Zepf 2001; Bastian et al. 2005a). Our\nresult is therefore consistent with the bluest knots having the same mass-radius relation\nas GMCs in general, contrary to what is measured for individual young star clusters (e.g.,\nBastian et al. 2005b). An offset between both relations can be used to estimate the star\nformation efficiency within the cloud, as done in Bastian et al. (2005a). Data from the\nALMA observatory, which will be able to reach sub-arcsecond resolution, will permit the\nachivement of this estimation for (U)LIRG systems.\n70\n\n\f4 - General Properties of the Knots\n4.6\n\nLuminosity Function of the Knots in the Closest Systems\n\nThe large number of detected knots allows us to study their luminosity function and\ncompare it with that for other less luminous and/or interacting galaxies. However, this\ncomparison should be restricted to the closest (U)LIRGs, since given the sizes measured\ncomplexes of star clusters are detected only for galaxies located at distances larger than\n100 Mpc with the resolution of the ACS. Although many knots detected in our closest\nsystems may still consist of complexes of star clusters, in order to minimize distance\neffects (see Section 3) we focus here on a subsample that comprises the seven systems\ncloser to this distance (see specific distances in Chapter I, Table I.1).\nTo compute the slope of the LF for the knots in both the blue and red filters (as\nexplained in Chapter I, Section 3.3), we assigned a lower limit cutoff to the brightest\nvalue of the 90% completeness limit in order to ensure the same level of completeness for\nthe whole subsample. The single power-law fits to our blue and red luminosity functions\nare not significantly different, with slopes of \u03b1 = 1.95 and \u03b1 = 1.89 for the F435W (blue)\nand the F814W (red) filters, respectively (see Fig. II.7).\nThe slopes in this study are in disagreement with the much flatter slopes previously\nmeasured in ULIRGs (Surace et al. 1998). Surace and coworkers argued that the flattening of the slope is the artificial consequence of not resolving individual clusters, but\nassociations of clusters (the bright end is overpopulated), the same bias that we encounter but more severe. In addition, other factors could contribute to the flattening of\nthe LF in that study, as well as in other works (see Table II.1): (i) the slopes are not\ncorrected for incompleteness (like in NGC 7252 in Miller et al. 1997 and NGC 4038/39\nin Whitmore et al. 1999), (ii) the statistics are more limited, since the distribution of less\nthan 90 knots is fitted within their completeness limit interval, and (iii) ACS imaging is\nmore sensitive than WFPC2, and since we are observing closer systems, the LF can be\nmeasured to intrinsically fainter magnitudes.\nThe slopes measured for our subsample are however similar to those obtained for\nother less luminous interacting galaxies such as in NGC 4038/39, NGC 3921, NGC 7252\nand Arp 284 (see Table II.1). As the studies start to resolve individual clusters and\ncorrections for incompleteness are applied the slopes tend to consolidate around a value\nof 2-2.2. For instance, reff (between 5 or unresolved, and 50 pc) derived in early studies\n(Whitmore & Schweizer 1995) for clusters in NGC 4038/39, indicate that some blending\nexisted and thus the slope of the LF is somewhat flatter than in more recent studies\nwhich detect only individual clusters and corrections for incompleteness are applied as\nwell (Whitmore et al. 1999,2010); see values in Table II.1. In any case, we did not\nexpected noticeable flattening of the slope, since the mass function of molecular clouds\nin the Local Group (Blitz et al. 2007) and in different ISM models (Fleck 1996; Wada\net al. 2000; Elmegreen 2002) is consistent with a slope of index 2, like the mass function\nfor clusters in interacting systems (e.g., Bik et al. 2003; Gieles 2009a). This similarity\ncan be reflected in the LF. Given the fact that several clusters can be formed from a\n71\n\n\fChap.

The line shows the fit up to the completeness\nlimit computed for each filter.\n\nsingle molecular cloud, if there is not much blending (like in our case of nearby systems),\na similar slope of the LF is expected.\nTherefore, the result obtained in this study extends the universality of the slope of\nthe luminosity function regardless of the intensity of the star formation in interacting\ngalaxies, to extreme star-forming systems like the luminous and ultraluminous infrared\ngalaxies, at least for systems closer than 100 Mpc.\n\n5\n\nProperties of the Knots as a Function of Infrared Luminosity\n\nFor most (U)LIRGs the infrared luminosity comes mainly from the re-emission by\ndust of light emitted in intense episodes of star formation. In this study we span a\nrange of a factor of 15 in infrared luminosities from LIR = 11.39 to LIR = 12.54. To\ninvestigate whether the properties of the star-forming knots do show dependence on the\ninfrared luminosity (i.e., star formation rate), we divided the initial sample into three\nLIR intervals. We aim at covering the low, intermediate and high luminosity regimes\nwhile preserving a similar number of systems per luminosity bin for the subsequent\n72\n\n\f5 - Properties of the Knots as a Function of Infrared Luminosity\nTable II.1: Slopes of the LF computed for this work and for other interacting\nsystems\n\nGalaxy\n(1)\nULIRGs Surace\nNGC 3921\nNearby (U)LIRGs\nNCG 7252\nArp 284\nNGC 4038/39\nNGC 4038/39a\nNGC 4038/39\n\nDL (Mpc)\n(2)\n\nBand\n(3)\n\n\u03b1\n(4)\n\nUncertainty\n(5)\n\nRef.\n(6)\n\n422\n84.5\n72.8\n62.2\n33.6\n27.5\n27.5\n27.5\n\nI\nV\nB,I\nV\nI\nV\nV\nV\n\n1.39\n2.10\n1.95,1.89\n1.84\n2.30\n1.78\n2.01\n2.13\n\n0.08\n0.30\n0.02,0.04\n0.06\n0.30\n0.05\n0.11\n0.07\n\n[1]\n[2]\nThis work*\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]*\n\nNotes.

We therefore chose the following luminosity intervals: LIR < 11.65\n(low), 11.65 \u2264 LIR < 12.0 (intermediate) and LIR \u2265 12.0 (high). The number of systems\nthat lie in each interval is 11, 9 and 12, being at an average distance of 99, 166 and 258\nMpc, respectively. A summary of the properties of the knots per luminosity bin is given\nin Table II.2 and will be discussed in detail in subsequent subsections.\nAs shown in Chapter I, Fig. I.1, systems with higher infrared luminosity are in general\nintrinsically more distant. We tried to get rid of any distance effects by selecting a\nsubsample of systems located at a similar distance (those at 65-75 Mpc) and sampling\nall the LIR bins. This subsample, not homogeneously distributed, includes only one\nsystem in the intermediate and high luminosity bins (4,1 and 1 systems, respectively\nper luminosity bin). Furthermore, the results based only on the ULIRG Arp 220 (IRAS\n15327+2340) are not reliable since it is known to suffer extreme obscuration from its\nsilicate features (Spoon et al. 2007). We need to include a larger number of systems in\nthe defined luminosity bins in order to achieve more reliable statistics, thus we inevitably\nhave to deal with distance effects.\n73\n\n\fSystem/s\n\nLIR\n(or interval)\n(2)\n\n(1)\n(U)LIRGs\n(this work)\n\nNsys knots per\nsystem\n(3)\n(4)\n\nLIR < 11.65 (all)\n11.65 \u2264 LIR < 12.0\nLIR \u2265 12.0\n11.65 \u2264 LIR < 12.0 (all)\nLIR \u2265 12.0 (all)\n\nM51\nNGC 4038/4039\nULIRGs (Surace98)\n\n10\n10.7\nLIR > 12.0\n\nF 814W\n< DL > < MF 814W >< MF 435W >< C >< reff\n> \u03b1 LF\n(Mpc)\n(pc)\nF814W\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n\n11 113 \u00b1 102 99 \u00b1 26\n8\n84 \u00b1 59 178 \u00b1 27\n10 38 \u00b1 15 246 \u00b1 72\n9 115 \u00b1 109 166 \u00b1 45\n12 47 \u00b1 41 258 \u00b1 125\n\n-11.36\n-12.74\n-14.09\n-12.11\n-13.39\n\n-10.13\n-11.84\n-12.97\n-11.18\n-12.20\n\n1.13\n0.81\n0.97\n0.82\n1.10\n\n25\n55\n81\n45\n59\n\n1\n1\n9\n\n-8.4\n-11.7\n-14.7\n\n-7.6\n-11.0\n-13.7\n\n0.7\n0.9\n0.8\n\n16.8\n65\n\n881\n10.6\n\u223c 104\n27.5\n12 \u00b1 10 520 \u00b1 210\n\n1.80\n1.73\n1.83\n1.78\n1.78\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n-\n\n0.02\n0.04\n0.03\n0.04\n0.04\n\n\u03b1 LF\nF435W\n(11)\n1.77\n1.79\n1.78\n1.78\n1.78\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n0.02\n0.04\n0.04\n0.04\n0.04\n\n-\n\nNotes.

Thus, the\nstatistics that are shown first in Table II.2 for the intermediate luminosity interval do\nnot take into account IRAS 04315-0840, and for the high luminosity interval the knots\nin IRAS 15206+3342 and in IRAS 15327+2340 are not considered either. However, for\ncompleteness, the statistics is also provided considering all the sources in each LIR bin.\n\n5.1\n\nMagnitudes and Colors of the Knots as a Function of LIR\n\nKnots show a dramatic increase (\u00d7 12) in their blue and red luminosities (i.e., 2.7 mag)\nwith the infrared luminosity of the entire galaxy while basically preserving their colors\n(see histograms in Fig. II.8, and average properties listed in Table II.2). Our simulations\n(Section 3, Fig. II.1) suggest that distance effects can explain only part of the differences\n75\n\n\fChap. II Optically-selected Compact Star-Forming Regions in (U)LIRGs\n\nFigure II.9: Color-magnitude diagrams of all the identified knots (black) at different LIR intervals, compared with other interacting systems from the literature. The gray band covers the\n80% of the total number of knots in each plot, as in Fig. II.2. The colors refer to clusters/knots\nmeasured in M51 (orange) taken from Bik et al. (2003), in the ULIRG sample of Surace et al.\n(1998) (pink) and in NGC 4038/4039 (blue, those younger than 10 Myr; green, those between\n250 and 1000 Myr; and red, those older than 1 Gyr), taken from Whitmore et al. (1999).\n\nrevealed by the data. If the same type of galaxies are located at the average distance\nof the low, intermediate and high luminosity subsamples, the distance effect does not\nchange significantly the colors while increasing the luminosity (absolute magnitude) by\nonly a factor of 2.8 (1.1 mag). Therefore, we conclude that knots in highly luminous\ngalaxies are at least a factor of four more luminous than knots located in systems with\nlower infrared luminosity.\nIt is interesting to mention that when comparing these results with those independently obtained for nearby, less luminous systems (the weakly and strongly interacting\ngalaxies M51 and NGC 4038/4039, respectively), and more distant ULIRGs (Surace et al.\n1998), the same trend with infrared luminosity appears (see Fig. II.9 and Table II.2).\nIn nearby systems like M51 and NGC 4038/4039, the angular resolution is such that\nindividual clusters, instead of aggregates as in more distant galaxies, are detected, and\ntherefore the difference in the luminosity of clusters and knots can be partly due to a\ndistance effect. Knots in distant ULIRGs tend to be as luminous as knots detected in our\ncloser high-luminosity galaxies (also ULIRGs) while having colors similar to those knots\ndetected in our sample and clusters in M51 and NGC 4038/4039 (The Antennae). The\nmost luminous clusters in the Antennae cover a luminosity range close to the median\nvalue for knots detected in our low-luminosity systems. Finally, clusters in the very low\nluminosity, weakly interacting M51 galaxy are on average about 3 mag fainter (i.e., x15\nless luminous) than knots in our low-luminosity galaxies.\nIf we assume a statistically similar extinction and age for the star-forming knots\n76\n\n\f5 - Properties of the Knots as a Function of Infrared Luminosity\nregardless of the LIR of the system, the most plausible explanation for the luminosity\nexcess measured in the intermediate and high luminosity systems has to invoke a mass\nand/or density effects:\n\u2022 Mass effect. More high-mass knots are sampled in the most luminous systems.\n\u2022 Density effect. The knots are aggregates of an intrinsically larger number of clusters\nas the infrared luminosity of the system increases.\nThe star formation rate as well as the gas content in ULIRGs is higher than in less\nluminous systems and as a consequence, these systems form more clusters. Therefore, it\nis matter of simple statistics rather than a difference in physical formation mechanisms\nthat in ULIRGs we find the brightest knots. Given the stability of the colors among\nthe different infrared luminosity sample, they likely represent the most massive knots.\nThis stochastic process, known as size-of-sample effect (Whitmore et al. 2007), can\nexplain the demographics of star cluster systems in the merging environment, where the\nstar formation is enhanced. Therefore, although density effects cannot be discarded our\nresult is compatible with a mass effect (which in turn corresponds to a size-of-sample\neffect), explained by statistics.\n5.2\n\nSpatial Distribution of the Knots as a Function of LIR\n\nOne important aspect to investigate is whether the spatial distribution of the knots\nshows dependence on the luminosity of the system. We measure a ratio of inner to outer\nknots (Ninner /Nouter ) that changes with LIR from 0.68 to 0.49 and 0.31 for the three\n(low-, intermediate- and high-) luminosity intervals, respectively). According to our\nsimulations, these differences are consistent with being purely due to a distance effect\n(see Table II.2 for the average distance of the different luminosity bins), and therefore\nno evidence for the dependence of the spatial distribution of the knots on the infrared\nluminosity of the systems is found.\n5.3\n\nEffective Radius of the Knots as a Function of LIR\n\nIf there is a change in the luminosity of the knots with the bolometric luminosity of the\nsystem, their size could show a variation as well. At first glance, this seems to be the case\n(see Fig. II.8 and Fig. II.10). As the luminosity of the system increases, the distribution\nof reff shows a broadening with a non negligible fraction of the knots having sizes larger\nthan 100 pc. This is more clear for the high-luminosity systems (ULIRGs ). However,\nas our simulations have shown (see Fig. II.1), this changes can be explained purely as\na distance effect. On the one hand, the distribution of reff of the knots in ULIRGs is\nsimilar to the simulated reff distribution. Moreover, the median value of reff in ULIRGs is\n77\n\n\fChap.

Note that the x-axis is in log scale. We have divided\nthe knots in our sample in three groups depending on their infrared luminosity. Values for\nclusters in the Antennae were taken from Whitmore & Schweizer (1995), in NGC 7252 (with\nLIR = 10.70) from Whitmore et al. (1993) and in the ULIRG sample from Surace et al. (1998).\nThe inset plot shows the same for the unresolved knots in this study.\n\n81 pc (see Table II.2), slightly larger, but consistent within the uncertainties, with the\n75 pc derived from the simulations. In fact, the sizes of the knots in the closest systems\n(i.e., DL < 100 Mpc), where individual clusters are almost resolved, are closer to the\nsizes of clusters measured in less luminous interacting galaxies (e.g., see clusters of NGC\n4038/4039 and NGC 7252 in Fig. II.10). Therefore, with the present angular resolution\nthere is no evidence for a variation in size with luminosity.\n\n5.4\n\nMass-radius Relation of the Bluest Knots as a Function of LIR\n\nWe have seen that in general terms the bluest knots in our sample follow a massradius relation with index \u03b3\u223c2, similar to that in GMCs and complexes of clusters in\nless luminous interacting systems (see Section 4.5). Here we have the opportunity to\ncharacterize this relation as a function of the infrared luminosity of the system.\nThough with high dispersion, the correlation holds for the low and intermediate in78\n\n\f5 - Properties of the Knots as a Function of Infrared Luminosity\n\nLIR < 11.65\n\nlog (M/MO\u2022 )\n\n7\n\n\u03b3=2.54\u00b10.39\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n11.65 <\n_ LIR < 12\n\nlog (M/MO\u2022 )\n\n7\n\n\u03b3=2.12\u00b10.23\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\nLIR >\n_ 12\n\nlog (M/MO\u2022 )\n\n7\n\n\u03b3=1.35\u00b10.53\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n1.5\n\n2.0\n2.5\nlog (radius/pc)\n\n3.0\n\nFigure II.11: The mass vs. radius relation for knots in (U)LIRGs as a function of LIR .

The fit for the bluest knots in ULIRGs gives\na shallower index, though it could still be consistent with a value of \u03b3=1.9 given the\nlarge dispersion on the index values. The fit is affected in any case by the small number\nof blue knots in ULIRGs and probably by distance effects. Therefore, according to our\ndata, there is no clear variation of the mass-radius relation with the infrared luminosity\nof the system.\n\n5.5\n\nLuminosity Function of the Knots as a Function of LIR\n\nThe derived slopes of the luminosity functions with values between 1.7 and 1.8\n(see Table II.2) do not show any clear trend of variation with the luminosity of the\nsystem. However, our simulations of the distance effect show that the slope of the\nLF becomes shallower by about 0.15 dex when moving the low-luminosity systems to\nthe average distance of the high-luminosity subsample (see Fig. II.1). This change in the\nslope is due to the reduction in the linear resolution such that knots that appear resolved\nin the closer, low-luminosity systems appear to be more luminous aggregates in the more\ndistant luminous systems. Therefore, the distance-corrected slopes for the intermediate\nand high-luminosity subsamples would be about 1.9-2, in the range of those measured in\nother low-z interacting galaxies (see Table II.1).\nWe know that these slopes were derived using the luminosity of complexes of clusters,\nespecially in the case of systems in the intermediate and high infrared luminosity intervals.\nThus, the slopes here might not reflect the physics beneath the formation and dissolution\nof star clusters, as normally do for nearby galaxies. However, we have investigated how\ndistance effects can distort these slopes. Therefore, we conclude that, in absence of better\nangular resolution images, our data suggest that the LF remains universal with slopes\nabout \u03b1 = 2 within the (U)LIRG luminosity range. Based on the universality of the\nLF, Whitmore et al. (2007) claim that active mergers have the brightest clusters only\nbecause they contain more clusters (i.e., size-of-sample effect). Thus, if the discrepancy\nbetween the luminosities of knots in ULIRGs and in LIRGs is explained by this effect\n(which is likely to be the case), then the physics underlying the disruption of clusters in\nthe highest luminous infrared galaxies can be the same as in less luminous systems.\n\n6\n\nProperties of the Knots as a Function of Interaction Phase\n\nStrong interactions and mergers provide a natural laboratory for probing how star\nformation is affected by tidal forces and major rearrangements of the gaseous component\nduring the different phases of the interaction. Most of the systems in our sample are\ninteracting systems, hence we divided the sample into four groups, depending on the\nmorphology seen in the F814W HST images. Each group represents snapshots of the\ndifferent phases of the interaction/merger: first approach, pre-merger, merger and post80\n\n\fInteraction phase\n\n< MF 814W >\n\n< MF 435W >\n\n<C>\n\nF 814W\n< reff\n>\n(pc)\n\n49\n42\n37\n50\n\n-11.25\n-11.91\n-11.23\n-13.35\n\n-10.26\n-10.77\n-10.24\n-11.49\n\n0.93\n1.06\n0.96\n1.49\n\n24\n35\n25\n44\n\n1.50\n1.84\n2.00\n1.76\n\n140 \u00b1 55\n192 \u00b1 98\n142 \u00b1 71\n213 \u00b1 159\n\n-11.54\n-12.29\n-11.41\n-13.51\n\n-10.66\n-11.12\n-10.38\n-11.73\n\n0.92\n1.04\n0.96\n1.55\n\n27\n40\n26\n49\n\n1.53 \u00b1 0.10\n1.93 \u00b1 0.03\n1.83 \u00b1 0.02\n-\n\nNsys\n\nknots per\nsystem\n\n< DL >\n(Mpc)\n\nFirst Approach\nPre-merger\nMerger\nPost-Merger\n\n3\n8\n6\n5\n\n153 \u00b1 127\n145 \u00b1 81\n139 \u00b1 123\n34 \u00b1 19\n\n121\n126\n107\n145\n\nFirst Approach\nPre-merger\nMerger\nPost-Merger\n\n4\n13\n8\n7\n\n131 \u00b1 113\n103 \u00b1 83\n112 \u00b1 115\n29 \u00b1 18\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n\u03b1 LF F814W\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n0.09\n0.03\n0.04\n0.12\n\n\u03b1 LF F435W\n1.63\n1.86\n1.86\n1.58\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.03\n0.17\n\n1.67 \u00b1 0.02\n1.86 \u00b1 0.03\n1.78 \u00b1 0.03\n-\n\nNotes.

Col (6): same as (4), but only the contribution of the flux\nat 25\u03bcm is taken to compute LIR .\n\n6.1\n\nMagnitudes and Colors as a Function of Interaction Phase\n\nThe magnitudes and colors of the knots in the first three interaction phases differ\nsignificantly from those of the knots in the post-merger phase (see results in Table II.3).\nEven if in a strictly statistical sense (Kolmogoroff-Smirnov test at a confidence level of\nat least 98%) the population of knots in the first three phases are different, their median\nvalues and distributions are very similar suggesting the lack of strong differences. This\nis true in particular if, in order to minimize the distance effect, only galaxies at similar\ndistances in each phase are considered (see Table II.3 and Fig. II.12). However, the\npopulation of knots in the post-merger phase are significantly more luminous (median\nI -band magnitude difference of up to 2 mag), and significantly redder than in any of\nthe three earlier phases. Furthermore, the population of knots in the post-merger phase\nshows in its color distribution an extension toward redder colors (MF 435W -MF 814W > 3).\nThe fact that knots in the post-merger phase have redder colors means that they likely\nrepresent either a more obscured or an older population. In the following we explore\nboth alternatives:\n1. To investigate whether the knots in the post-merger phase are intrinsically more\nobscured than in any of the previous phases, we define the infrared to ultraviolet\nluminosity ratio (IR/UV) as:\n\nIR/UV =\n\nLIR\n\u03bbL\u03bb (FUV) + \u03bbL\u03bb (NUV)\n\n(II.1)\n\n83\n\nUV\n\n\fChap. II Optically-selected Compact Star-Forming Regions in (U)LIRGs\nwhere LIR stands for the infrared luminosity, \u03bb to the pivot wavelength of a given filter and L\u03bb to the flux in the near (NUV) and far (FUV) ultraviolet emission (Howell\net al. 2010). This ratio is a useful empirical measurement of the dust absorption\nand emission in these heavily obscured systems. We searched for UV images in\nthe Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX ) catalog, using the Multimission Archive\nat STScI (MASTa ) facility. With a typical angular resolution of about 4-5\u2032\u2032in the\nFUV-NUV (\u03bb = 1528-2271) range, we can estimate an average value of IR/UV for\neach system assuming that the far infrared and ultraviolet flux is emitted in the\nsame regions. Even if this is not necessarily true, taking into account that most\nof the nuclear star formation is obscured in (U)LIRGs, we can have a first-order\nestimate on which systems have a higher average extinction.\nA total of 16 systems were detected in the GR5 data set, most of them in the\nAll-Sky Imaging survey (ASIb ). The other systems were either not detected or not\nobserved. In this dataset, the images are already reduced, the sources detected\nand the photometry performed. In general the photometry was performed using\nan aperture that covers the entire galaxy (if two galaxies form the system we add\nup the flux values). We then take the value of the flux provided by the data set\nfacility.\nWith the flux in the far and near UV and the infrared luminosity we estimated\nan average value of the IR/UV ratio for each system. Although the assumption\nby Kennicutt (1998) that the great majority of the luminosity from young stars\nwould be absorbed by dust and re-radiated in the far-IR is likely to be correct,\nobservationally there may be other contributions to the total IR luminosity from\nolder populations of stars or other luminosity sources (e.g., see the review by Tuffs\n& Popescu 2005). For that reason, we also computed the IR/UV ratio taking only\nthe contribution at 25\u03bcm in IRAS (IR25 ), based on the good relation between the\nmid-IR 24\u03bcm-25\u03bcm (MIPS-IRAS) and the number of ionizing photons as derived\nfrom extinction corrected Pa\u03b1 and H\u03b1 luminosities (Wu et al. 2005; Alonso-Herrero\net al. 2006; Calzetti et al. 2007). This way we select only hot dust, heated by the\nradiation of young population, and avoid any contribution from colder dust, heated\nby older stars.\nBearing in mind that we are dealing with a small number of statistics, there is a\ntrend toward higher values of the IR/UV ratio in not only the post-merger but also\nthe merger phase, with respect to early phases represented by the first approach\nand pre-merger (see values in Table II.4). Since this ratio is related to an average\ndust absorption, this result suggests that knots in the late phases of an interaction\ncould be suffering on average intrinsically more extinction than in early phases. For\ninstance, an additional average extinction of AV =1 can already redden the colors\nby about 0.6, according to the SB99 models (see Chapter I, Fig. I.7). If this were\nthe case, the population of clusters in the late phases of a merger would be more\na\nb\n\n84\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/\nVisit the GALEX website, http://www.galex.caltech.edu/, for more information\n\n\f6 - Properties of the Knots as a Function of Interaction Phase\nluminous than in previous phases. Therefore, we would need to invoke a physical\nprocess responsible for this significant increase in luminosity. Note however that\ndust absorption shows significant structure on scales of a kiloparsec or less (Garc\u00edaMar\u00edn et al. 2009a), and therefore the measured IR/UV ratios do not necessarily\nrepresent the intrinsic absorption toward the individual optically-selected clusters.\nA larger set of high angular resolution UV and mid-IR imaging is required before\nany firm conclusion is derived.\n\n2. An alternative scenario to explain the differences in color and luminosity of the\nknots identified in the post-merger phase with respect to early phases can invoke\nevolutionary effects. As proposed by Kroupa (1998), many dozens or even hundreds of massive individual star clusters with masses of 105 -107 M\u2299 could merge\ninto extremely massive super star clusters (SSCs) after a few hundred Myr. This\nhierarchical star formation evolution was also suggested to be happening in complexes of clusters in M51 (Bastian et al. 2005a). As the interaction proceeds, the\nsmaller SSCs would be destroyed by disruption effects (e.g., by the mechanisms\nproposed in Whitmore et al. 2007) and a few massive individual clusters would\nstill be able to form. Note that, although with a large dispersion, while the number\nof knots per system stays about the same (140-150) in the first three phases, this\nnumber drops by a factor of 4 to 5 in the post-merger phase (34 knots per system).\nThus, in the post-merger phase systems we might be detecting only the evolved,\nextremely massive SSCs and a few massive individual clusters. The knots with\nthe reddest colors could be evolved SSCs as massive as 107\u22129 M\u2299 with an optical\nextinction (AV ) of 3 mag, or massive young clusters with higher extinction.\nKroupa (1998) estimated that after 100 Myr or so an object with these characteristics can be formed. If the merging of clusters started during the early phases of\nthe interaction we would have already detected some of them in the merger phase.\nGiven the degeneracy of the MF 435W -MF 814W color we could only set an upperlimit to the number of merged superclusters in this phase. Thus, with a color\nhigher than MF 435W -MF 814W = 0.6 and a luminosity higher than MF 814W = -15,\nan object could be more massive than 107 M\u2299 , were it around or older than 100\nMyr. About three such knots per system are detected in our sample of (U)LIRGs.\nObviously, photometry at other wavelengths is necessary to better constrain the\nages and masses of these knots and thus to check the validity of this scenario for\n(U)LIRG systems. Likewise, simulations of galactic encounters help us know if this\nscenario can occur in this environment. A detailed comparison of the present observational results with state-of-the-art high-resolution numerical simulations (Bournaud et al. 2008b) is presented in Chapter III, to further investigate this scenario.\n85\n\n\fChap. II Optically-selected Compact Star-Forming Regions in (U)LIRGs\n6.2\n\nSpatial Distribution as a Function of Interaction Phase\n\nWe investigated the relative fraction of inner (inside 2.5 kpc radius) and outer (outside\n2.5 kpc radius) knots in the four interaction phases defined above in order to know if\nmajor mergers have an impact on the spatial distribution of the knots. Although the\nnumber of systems in each phase is small (3, 8, 6 and 5 for the first approach, pre-merger,\nmerger, and post-merger) the ratio Ninner /Nouter is 0.50, 0.65, 0.52, 0.68 from the first\napproach to the post-merger.\nWe do not see any correlation toward a more dispersed or concentrated spatial distribution of the knots with interaction phase. However, in the pre- and post-merger phases,\nwhere the magnitudes are higher compared to the other phases, there is some evidence\nof greater concentration toward the nuclear regions. The greater the number of knots\nin the central regions, the harder it is to detect them, and therefore, only the brightest\nones are identified given the local background conditions (bright and steep light profiles).\nHence, this effect can contribute to a small increase in the luminosity distribution of the\nknots in these phases. Assuming that the knots in the pre-merger phase have a luminosity similar to that in the first contact and merger phases, this effect would increase the\nmedian luminosity by a factor of almost 2. Since the ratio Ninner /Nouter in this phase is\nsimilar to the ratio in the post-merger phase, an additional increase of a factor of about\n5 would still be unexplained by the first scenario explored in the previous section. A\nlarger sample of galaxies would be required to establish a firmer result.\n\n6.3\n\nEffective Radius as a Function of Interaction Phase\n\nAll size distributions are statistically different with a high degree of confidence (higher\nthan 99%), yet the median value of reff is similar during the three first interaction phases\nindicating that these differences must be rather small. However, knots in the postmerger phase tend to be larger by factors of 1.3 to 2 than in any of the previous phases\n(see Table II.3). This result is not very robust, given the uncertainties in the determination of sizes, but if confirmed, it would support the hierarchical star formation scenario proposed by Kroupa (1998). According to this scenario, the merged super clusters\nwould have a half-mass radius of about rh = 45-95 pc. Under the assumption of virial\nequilibrium and isotropic velocity distribution the effective and half-mass radius can be\nrelated as reff = 3/4\u00d7rh . Then, the merged extremely massive super clusters would have\nreff = 30-70 pc, similar to the values measured for knots in the post-merger sample.\n\n6.4\n\nMass-radius Relation of the Bluest Knots with Interaction Phase\n\nThe broad-band emission of the knots for which we have measured the mass is very\nmuch likely to come from young population (i.e., \u03c4 < 30 Myr; see Section 4.4).

The solid red line is a power-law fit to the data, with index \u03b3.\n\non equivalent width measurements, Bastian et al. (2005a) determined the age of the\ncomplexes in M51 to be in the range 5-8 Myr. On the other hand, the phases of interaction\nare separated by hundreds of Myr. Thus, although we cannot study how the mass-radius\nrelation of the knots behaves as they evolve, we can see if they all have a similar relation\nat a short time after they are born during the interaction process.\nThe mass-size relation of the bluest knots in the three interaction phases for which\na fit could be achieved is consistent with an index of \u03b3 = 2 (Fig. II.13). Although the\nline-fit seems to become shallower as the interaction proceeds from the first approach up\nto the merger phase (from \u03b3 = 2.11 to 1.71), the dispersion is too high to accept that\nit varies. Actually, the fit that we obtained using all the knots gives a slope inbetween\nboth values (1.91; see Section 4.5).\n87\n\n\fChap. II Optically-selected Compact Star-Forming Regions in (U)LIRGs\n6.5\n\nLuminosity Function as a Function of Interaction Phase\n\nThere appears to be a trend in the slopes of the LFs of the knots with interaction phase\nsuch that they become steeper as the interaction evolves from first contact to pre-merger\nand up to merger and post-merger (see Table II.3). This is particularly more visible\nwhen only systems at similar distances and I -band LFs, i.e., less affected by extinction\neffects, are considered (slopes of 1.50, 1.84, 2.0 and 1.76, respectively). Note, however,\nthat the slope of the LF for the post-merger phase is computed with less than 100 knots\n(brighter than the completeness limit), hence it is statistically less significant than the\nother slopes. Also note that the systematic uncertainties of the slope of the LF can\nbe as high as about 0.1 dex (the tables give the uncertainty related only to the fit), as\nmentioned in Chapter I (Section 3.3). Thus, the observed trend is very weak.\nIf we select only systems closer than 100 Mpc (see Section 4.6), the phases are also\nsampled. We can try to further minimize distance effects by computing the LF only for\nthese systems. While 400-600 measurements can be used in each of the other phases, on\nthe post-merger phase we are instead restricted to only about 30 knots and thus, we will\nnot include this phase in this analysis. The slopes derived for the closest systems are\n1.68-1.68-1.92 (1.75-1.77-1.99) for the I - (B -) band LF for the first contact, pre-merger\nand merger phases, respectively. It is interesting to note that in this case the LF still\nbecomes steeper when the systems evolve from the pre-merger to the merger phases.\n(U)LIRGs are known to have high SFRs at all phases of interaction. However, this\ncan be concentrated at small scales or more dispersed and, at the same time, less or more\nhidden by dust. For instance, 80% of the total infrared luminosity in IRAS 20550+1656\ncomes from an extremely compact, red source not associated with the nuclei of the\nmerging galaxies but with a buried starburst (Inami et al. 2010). If, on average, we\ndetect more young knots in the optical at early phases of interaction than in more evolved\nphases, they can overpopulate the bright end of the luminosity function, and thus the\nmeasured slope would be shallower. In Chapter III we compare the observed LFs with\nthose computed from the mass functions in numerical simulations by Bournaud et al.\n(Bournaud et al. 2008b) and stellar population synthesis models (i.e., mass to light\nratios). This comparision can help us learn if the observed trend (change of the slope as\nthe interaction evolves) is real and allow us to investigate its origin.\n\n7\n\nKnots in (U)LIRGs vs. Star-forming Clumps at high-z\n\n(U)LIRGs represent the extreme cases of low-redshift star-forming galaxies associated\nwith spirals, interacting galaxies and mergers. Deep cosmological imaging and spectroscopic surveys at redshifts z \u223c 1-4 have identified massive star-forming galaxies with\nirregular structures where the star formation appears to proceed in large clumps,with\nsizes in the 0.1-1.5 kpc range.

Faint tidal features are difficult to discern at\nhigher redshifts because of cosmological dimming. It is important therefore to make a\ndirect comparison between the star-forming knots in (U)LIRGs and in clumpy high-z\ngalaxies in order to understand the similarities and differences of the star formation in\nthe present Universe and at cosmological distances.\nThe clumps in high-z galaxies are less numerous and intrinsically brighter and more\nmassive (by a factor of 10-1000) than the largest star-forming complexes in local galaxies\n(Efremov 1995; Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2005; Elmegreen et al. 2007, 2009; F\u00f6rster\nSchreiber et al. 2011b). The integrated luminosity of these clumps usually accounts for\nabout 10-25% of the total luminosity. The larger masses in the high-redshift galaxies are\nthought to be the result of high turbulence in the disks. In fact, velocity dispersions of 40\nkm s\u22121 have been derived from spectroscopic observations of UDF6462, a z = 1.6 galaxy\n(Bournaud et al. 2008a). This large-scale star formation can also be reproduced by\nmeans of numerical simulations which require velocity dispersions several times higher\nthan in local quiescent galaxies (Bournaud et al. 2007). Finally, these high velocity\ndispersions have already been observed in clumps in local ULIRGs (Monreal-Ibero et al.\n2007), since gravitational torques in major mergers can also induce star formation in\nlarge condensations of gas. Yet, the last mention has to be taken with care since strong\nwinds and shocks in mergers can also induce large gradients in the velocity fields (i.e.,\nhigh velocity dispersions).\n89\n\n\fChap. II Optically-selected Compact Star-Forming Regions in (U)LIRGs\nIn the standard \u039bCDM cosmology (Spergel et al. 2007) the angular size is nearly\nconstant over the redshift range 0.7 < z < 4. At closer redshifts, the angular size decreases approximately linearly with increasing redshift. A kpc-sized clump corresponds\nto 3-4 pixels in the ACS images at high redshift values. Thus, clumps much smaller than\nthis could not be measured at high redshifts. On the other hand, if there were clumps\nsignificantly larger than this in nearby galaxies, they would be easily discernible. The\nlack of spatial resolution at high redshifts can make a complex of star formation look like\na clump since the light from the different clusters combines, blurs and some contrast with\nthe local background is lost. Whether the high-z clumps correspond to a single entity or\nto complexes of star formation, the largest complexes can be identified and compared in\nboth local and high-redshift galaxies. The high-z galaxy clumps have masses typically\nbetween 107 and 109 M\u2299 from z = 1 to 4, decreasing to about 106 M\u2299 at z = 0.1-0.2.\nThe star-forming regions in the few interacting clumpy galaxies observed have sizes similar to star complexes in local interacting systems (i.e., the Antennae or M51), and their\nmass is 10-1000 times higher. On the other hand, complexes in the Hickson Compact\nGroup 31 (HCG 31), stellar complexes, which are sensitive to the magnitude of disk turbulence, have both sizes and masses more characteristic of z = 1-2 galaxies (Gallagher\net al. 2010).\nIn Section 5.1 we saw that knots in ULIRGs are intrinsically more luminous than knots\nin less luminous systems. This means that for complexes of similar sizes and similar\npopulation (Table II.2 shows that the colors of the knots in LIRGs and ULIRGs are\nsimilar) the knots in ULIRGs (they could also be understood as clumps or complexes of\nstar clusters) can be more massive than in our low luminous LIRGs by at least a factor\nof 4. Although the knots in our ULIRGs only account for 0.5-2% of the total luminosity\n(much less than clumps at high redshift), we can compare them with the complexes in\nhigh-redshift galaxies in order to determine if the star formation is similar or not to\nthat in clumpy galaxies . Already at z \u2243 0.05-0.1 a significant percentage of knots in\nULIRGs are more luminous than MF 814W = -15 mag (see Fig. II.9). According to the\nmodels used in this study, if we assume that these knots are formed by a single young\n(e.g., \u03c4 \u223c 6 Myr) population they can be as massive as few 104 - few 107 M\u2299 , with a\nmedian value of 1.4\u00d7105 M\u2299 . An older population (e.g., \u03c4 \u223c 50 Myr) implies a knot\nwith higher mass by one order of magnitude. Correction for internal extinction makes\nthe population even more massive. Thus, these values have to be understood as a lower\nlimit. To compare the knots in these ULIRGs with the clumps at high-redshift galaxies,\nwe applied a Gaussian blur to our images in such a way that we simulate their appearance\nat z = 1 (the scale at this redshift corresponds to 7.69 kpc/\u2032\u2032 ), using the same technique\nas explained in Section 3.\nThe knots in the blurred images (hereafter high-z knots) were measured. Table II.5\nshow the results together with the values for clumps in galaxies at high redshifts and\nTDGs candidates found in our sample of (U)LIRGs (Chapter IV). Some of the high-z\nknots were not recognizable in the blurred images because they were too faint or too\nsmall; a few were blended with other knots that were too close or with the nucleus.\n90\n\n\f7 - Knots in (U)LIRGs vs. Star-forming Clumps at high-z\n\n10\n\nlog (M (MO\u2022 ))\n\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n1.5\nlog (projected d (kpc))\n\n2.0\n\nFigure II.14: Mass vs projected distance for complexes in simulated LIRGs at z=1 (in black for\na population of 6 Myr and in gray for a population of 50 Myr) and clumps in z=2 star-forming\ngalaxies (red; values taken from F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2011b).\n\nMost of the lowest mass knots and those close to the nucleus disappear, although the\nremaining high-z knots range from 2\u00d7105 M\u2299 to 7\u00d7107 M\u2299 , with a median value of\n2.5\u00d7106 M\u2299 . The effective radius averages about 700 pc and the total size is typically\nr & 1.5 kpc. Taking into account that the derived masses correspond to lower limits,\nthey are typically one or two orders of magnitude less massive than clumps in high-z\ngalaxies, having similar sizes. If the population that dominates the light of the high-z\nknots were older (e.g., \u03c4 > 50 Myr), the masses of the high-z knots would significantly\napproach those of clumps in high-z galaxies.\nHaving set a lower limit for the mass of knots in ULIRGs, the mass of kpc-complexes\nin these systems is not likely to lie far from clumps in high-z galaxies with a similar size.\nTherefore, the extreme cases of low-redshift star-forming galaxies (ULIRGs) are likely to\ninduce large-scale star formation similar to that observed in high-z disks (and some few\nmergers) with a high gas fraction.\nWe have also investigated how the projected distance of the high-z knots relates to\n91\n\n\fChap.

While other works do not find any clear relation, we measure\nlower mass high-z knots with increasing distance. Although, according to our results it\nis clear that the mass is mainly concentrated at small distances in ULIRGs, we can only\ncompare with one study of high-z galaxies and we explore larger distances by a factor of\n10.\n\n8\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nA comprehensive study of bright compact knots (most of them apparent associations of\nclusters) in a representative sample of 32 (U)LIRGs as a function of infrared luminosity\nand interaction phase has been performed using HST /ACS B - and I -band imaging,\nproviding linear resolutions of 10 to 40 pc, depending on the distance of the galaxy.\nThe sample has been divided into three infrared luminosity intervals (low, LIR < 11.65;\nintermediate, 11.65 \u2264 LIR < 12.0; and high, LIR \u2265 12.0) and in the 4 interaction phases\ndefined in Chapter I (Section 1.2), namely first approach, pre-merger, merger and postmerger. We have extended toward lower infrared luminosities previous studies focused\nonly on ULIRGs (e.g., Surace et al. 1998, 2000), and have detected close to 3000 knots,\nlarger than a factor of ten more than in the previous studies of ULIRGs . The main\nconclusions derived from this study are the following:\n1. The knots span a wide range in magnitudes (-20 . MF 814W . -9 and\n-19.5 . MF 435W . -7.5), and color (-1 . MF 435W -MF 814W . 5). The median\nvalues are MF 435W = -10.84, MF 814W = -11.96 and MF 435W -MF 814W = 1.0.\n2. The knots are in general compact, with a median effective radius of 32 pc, being\n12% unresolved and a few very extended, up to 200-400 pc. With these sizes,\nin general (and particularly for galaxies located at 100 Mpc or more) the knots\nconstitute complexes or aggregates of star clusters. Within the resolution limits\nthere is no evidence of a luminosity dependence on the size. A slight dependence on\nthe interaction phase, in particular in the post-merger phase, needs confirmation\nwith larger samples and better angular resolution.\n3. A non-negligible fraction (15%) of knots are blue and luminous. Given their color\n(MF 435W -MF 814W < 0.5) and magnitude (<MF 435W >= -11.5) they appear to be\nyoung (ages of about 5 to 30 Myr), almost free of extinction, and have masses\nsimilar to and up to one order of magnitude higher than the young massive clusters\ndetected in other less luminous interacting systems. In addition, some (5.7%) very\nluminous (MF 435W < -12.5), and relatively blue (MF 435W -MF 814W < 1.0) knots\nappear along the tidal tails and at their tips. These objects could be candidates\n92\n\n\f8 - Summary and Conclusions\nto Tidal Dwarf galaxies.\n4. Unlike for isolated young star clusters in other systems, we find a clear correlation\nbetween the knot mass and radius, M\u221d R2 , similar to that found for complexes of\nstar clusters in less luminous interacting galaxies (e.g., M51 and the Antennae) and\nGalactic and extragalactic giant molecular clouds. This relation does not seem to\nbe dependent on the infrared luminosity of the system or on the interaction phase.\n5. The star formation is characterized by B - and I -band luminosity functions (LF)\nwith slopes close to 2, extending therefore the universality of the LF measured in\ninteracting galaxies at least for nearby systems (i.e., DL < 100 Mpc), regardless\nof the total luminosity (i.e., the strength of the global star formation). This result\nhas to be taken with caution because the LF of our knots (which can be mainly\nformed of complexes of star clusters) may not reflect the same physics as the\nLF of individual star clusters. Nevertheless, there are slight indications that the\nLF evolves as the interaction progresses becoming steeper (from about 1.5 to 2 for\nthe I -band) from first approach to merger and post-merger phases.\n6. Taking into account distance effects, knots in high luminosity systems (ULIRGs)\nare intrinsically more luminous (a factor of about 4) than knots in less luminous\nsystems. Given the star formation rate in ULIRGs is higher than in less luminous systems, size-of-sample effects are likely to be the natural explanation for this.\n7. Knots in ULIRGs would have both sizes and masses characteristic of stellar complexes or clumps detected in galaxies at high redshifts (z & 1), were their population\nabout 50 Myr or older. Thus, there is evidence that the larger-scale star formation\nstructures are reminiscent of those seen during the epoch of morphological galaxy\ntransformations in dense environments.\n8. Knots in systems undergoing the post-merger phase are on average redder and\nmore luminous than those in systems in earlier phases. Scenarios involving either\na different spatial distribution of the obscuration or a different evolutionary phase\nin which small knots do not survive for long are considered. The evolutionary\nscenario could also explain the trend in size toward higher values in post-merger\nsystems. A comparison with numerical simulations to further investigate these\nscenarios are presented in Chapter III.\n\n93\n\n\f\fIII\nComparative Study with High Spatial\nResolution Simulations\nChapter\n\nOverview\nThis Chapter complements the previous one by including the\ntheoretical frame in the analysis and characterization of the\ndata. We present the first direct comparison of the properties\nof stellar regions (simulated knots) identified in a high spatial\nresolution simulation of a major merger with knots detected in\nour sample of (U)LIRGs. The main purpose of the comparison\nis to be able to interpret some of the properties measured in the\nprevious Chapter and to constrain the results of the simulation.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe role played by interactions and mergers in enhancing star formation has been\nwidely studied in the past few decades by means of numerical simulations (e.g., Barnes\n& Hernquist 1992a; Mihos & Hernquist 1994b; Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Springel\n2000; Barnes 2004; Springel & Hernquist 2005; Bournaud & Duc 2006; Cox et al. 2006; Di\nMatteo et al. 2007; Di Matteo et al. 2008; Teyssier et al. 2010). These studies have\nsupported the fact that major mergers induce star formation, though it has become clear\nthat the star formation efficiency is highly dependent upon the numerical recipe adopted\nfor star formation (density or shock dependent) and feedback assumptions. The spatial\nresolution achieved by the model is also decisive (Teyssier et al. 2010). The higher\nthe resolution the better the models can handle the inner phenomena affecting the star\nformation.\nEven though numerical simulations represent a powerful tool to study galaxy mergers,\nnone of the previous studies has been able to monitor the physical evolution of the starforming regions at typical scales of Super Star Clusters (SSCs) or associations of few\n95\n\n\fChap.

(2008b) presented a simulation of a wet galaxy merger with\nthe highest resolution in mass and spatial sampling reached until then. With a spatial\nresolution of 32 pc, they were able to directly identify dense structures with typical\nmasses of 106 -108 M\u2299 , similar to the most massive SSCs and aggregates of few clusters.\nThey argued that these dense structures are tightly bound and likely progenitors of\nlong-lived globular clusters. Models capable of resolving compact star-forming regions at\nsimilar spatial scales to observations at z \u2264 0.1 offer the opportunity to make a one-to-one\ncomparison.\nThis Chapter presents the first direct comparison of the properties of stellar regions\n(simulated knots) identified in the galaxy simulation by Bournaud et al. (2008b) with\nknots detected in (U)LIRGs. Belles et al. (in preparation) has performed the physical\ncharacterization of the most massive simulated knots (i.e., log M ( M\u2299 ) \u2265 7.5). In this\nthesis we also extend the statistics to all mass ranges, down to about log M ( M\u2299 ) \u223c 6.\nWith the available data from the simulation (see Chapter I, Section 2.3) and using stellar population synthesis techniques, the magnitudes, colors, and LFs of the simulated\nknots are evaluated at different interaction phases. This enables us to perform a direct\ncomparison with the properties of the observed knots studied in the previous Chapter, a\nstudy of stellar regions in an observational and theoretical frame simultaneously.\nTo avoid distance effects in this study, we only consider the knots detected in the\nprevious Chapter that belong to systems located at similar distances in each phase (see\nChapter II, Section 6). That is, a total of about 2200 knots in 22 (U)LIRGs. The galaxies\nare located at a median distance of 125 Mpc, with a dispersion of 40 Mpc.\nThe layout of the Chapter is as follows: Section 2 provides the description of additional analysis treatment of the data from the simulations and the definition of the\ninteraction phases under comparison; the comparison of the properties of the knots detected in observations and simulations is performed in Section 3, along with the temporal\nevolution of their physical and spatial distributions with the interaction process; finally,\nwe summarize the main conclusions in Section 4.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nAdditional Analysis Treatment and Definitions\nDerivation of the Photometric Properties of the Simulated Knots\n\nThe output of the simulation corresponds to the mass and the position of each particle\nat any given snapshot. However, the observational data consist of photometric (light)\nmeasurements. To compare both sets of data, we have chosen to convert the mass of\nthe simulated knots into light and compare the modeled luminosities because we know\ntheir age with an uncertainty of a few Myr. These estimates are more reliable than the\ndetermination of masses from the observed luminosity, which can be uncertain by large\n96\n\n\f2 - Additional Analysis Treatment and Definitions\nfactors (10-100 or even larger) if we only have the knowledge of the luminosities in the\nF435W and F814W bands (see Fig. I.7 in Chapter I, Section 3.2).\nTo perform such analysis, we first have to know the star formation history of the\nsimulated knots and then apply stellar population synthesis techniques to obtain the\nobservables (luminosities) we need to compare with the observed knots.\n\n2.1.1\n\nInitial Mass and Growth Phase in the Simulation\n\nReliable estimates of the magnitudes of the simulated knots require to know as well as\npossible their mass and age, and if they are formed by one or more populations. Belles\net al. (in prep) argue that the knots undergo a rapid growth phase in which their mass\nincreases by up to a factor of about 100 during their first 100 Myr or so of existence.\nDuring this phase, the number of new stars within each knot increases, while the number\nof old stars does not vary significantly. This suggests a scenario in which clumps of gas\nform first and then collapse to form stars. However, the model does not have enough\nresolution for us to know if the clump fragments and form little clusters which then merge\ntogether, or if the collapse is monolithic.\nOnce this phase ends, the mass of the knots stabilizes to what it is defined as the initial\nmass (Mini ). Later on, they lose mass (due to dynamical friction, two-body relaxation,\netc.), generally in a much moderate way. Since the simulated knots are tracked until\nthey disappear or until the end of the simulation, we assumed their initial mass to be the\nmass value 80-100 Myr (i.e., 6-8 snapshots) after it is detected for the first time. Then, if\na knot is massive enough for us to follow all the growth phase in the simulation, after 6-8\nsnapshots it will have reached the initial mass already. If, on the other hand, the knot\nis less massive, we will have missed this phase partially or completely. However, after\n6-8 snapshots its mass will be very similar to the initial mass because statistically it will\nlose mass in a much moderate way after having reached Mini. Thus, the initial mass was\ntaken as the peak value 80-100 Myr after it is detected for the first time.\nOnce the initial mass of the knots was known, we studied this phase of rapid growth\nfor the most massive knots. If a knot has an initial mass higher than Mini = 108 M\u2299 ,\nat the time when it is identified for the first time (at the beginning of this phase) it is\nstill massive enough (i.e., M > 106.2 M\u2299 ) to be detected against the local background.\nHence, the rapid growth phase is completely tracked for the most massive knots. In\ncontrast, this phase is missed partially or completely for a knot with lower initial mass\nsince, assuming that the rapid growth phase is similar, its mass at the beginning of the\nphase would be too low for the knot to be detected. In the extreme case where the initial\nmass of a knot is lower than M > 106.5 M\u2299 , we identify it for the first time when it\nhas already reached the initial mass. This mass (106.5 M\u2299 ) represents the global mass\ncompletition limit defined in Belles et al. (in preparation).\n97\n\n\fChap. III Comparative Study with High Spatial Resolution Simulations\nWe decomposed the growth phase in successive bursts of star formation. Since this\nphase lasts approximately six snapshots, the knots are formed by a combination of six\ndifferent stellar population, with different masses and ages. For each population, we\nderived the mass fraction and dragged it throughout the whole evolution of the simulation. Thus, for instance, when a massive knot appears for the first time, it has only one\npopulation. One additional population is created per snapshot until the knot reaches its\ninitial mass. Then, the mass fraction of each population is frozen and used as such until\nthe end of the simulation or its dissolution.\n2.1.2\n\nModeling the Stellar Populations\n\nCharacterizing the growth phase of the simulated knots involves identifying each population present in a knot and, especially, its age.\nTo characterize the growth phase of the simulated knots we need to identify as well as\npossible each population present in a knot. With that information and the use of stellar\npopulation synthesis models we were able to derive observables, such as the luminosities\nof the simulated knots.\nThe tracks of the SB99 models with solar metallicity, optimized for young ages, are\nused up to \u03c4 = 100 Myr. At older ages, the tracks by Maraston et al. (2005) are\nconsidered, where a rigorous treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch\n(TP-AGB) phase has been applied (relevant within the interval 0.1-1 Gyr). We consider\nthis rather high metallicity even at large radii because global mixing of the ISM in\nmergers, due to gas inflows and outflows, flattens any metallicity gradient of the parent\ngalaxies (Rupke et al. 2010; Di Matteo et al. 2011; Perez et al. 2011). Given the\nrelatively small gas mass at large radii, mixing of small amounts of more enriched gas\neasily raises the gas metallicity in these regions.\nThe growth phase is not completely tracked in the simulation for knots less massive\nthan 108 M\u2299 , thus we assumed that they are characterized in the same way as the\nmassive ones. When computing the mass fraction of the six stellar populations, we\napplied a gradual correction:\n(i) For knots in the interval 107 < Mini ( M\u2299 ) < 108 (first interval ) we assumed we\nhad missed the growth phase for 2 snapshots.\n(ii) For knots in the interval 106.5 < Mini ( M\u2299) \u2264 107 (second interval ), we had missed\nit for 4 snapshots.\n(iii) Finally, for knots less massive than the detection threshold (third interval, i.e.,\nMini < 106.5 M\u2299 ), we had missed it for 6 snapshots (i.e., the whole phase).\nThus, when a knot in the first interval was detected for the first time we assumed\n98\n\n\f2 - Additional Analysis Treatment and Definitions\nit was already formed by three stellar populations, with ages \u03c4 = 6.5 Myr (detected),\n6.5+13 (19.5) Myr (missed) and 6.5+13+13 (32.5) Myr (missed), respectively. Then, in\norder to estimate the luminosity we used the averaged mass fractions computed for all\nthe massive knots when they are formed by three populations. In the following snapshot,\nthe knot was assumed to be formed by four stellar populations (the older two we missed\nand the younger two in which the knot was detected). The new mass fractions of the\nnon-detected with respect to the detected populations were computed using the average\nmass fractions that we had derived for all the massive knots. Once the knot reached the\nsix stellar populations (at the fourth snapshot in this case), the final mass fraction values\nwere frozen and dragged until the knot disappeared or until the end of the simulation.\nA similar analysis procedure was followed for the knots in the second interval. The\nknots in the third interval were assumed to have already reached their initial mass when\nthey were first detected (i.e., they are already formed by the six stellar populations).\nHence, we dragged all the populations from the beginning and the mass fractions applied\ncorrespond to the average values that we had derived for the most massive knots.\nThis process introduce a typical uncertainty of 5-25 % in the knowledge of the mass\nfor each of the six populations for the least massive knots. Another major source of\nuncertainty comes from the age of the young population. When a knot appeared for the\nfirst time in the simulation we assumed the youngest out of the six populations is 6.5 Myr\nold, since the age elapsed between two consecutive snapshots is 13 Myr. To know how\nthis is translated into an uncertainty in magnitude, we assumed that the ages distribute\nfollowing a Gaussian function in the interval 0-13 Myr, with a mean value of 6.5 Myr\nand a one-sigma (1\u03c3) deviation of 6.5/3 (i.e., 2.17) Myr. According to the SB99 models,\nthis introduces a 1\u03c3 uncertainty of up to 0.5 mag in the F814W band and up to 0.3 mag\nin the F435W band. These uncertainties decrease considerably due to the aging of the\nknots while they evolve throughout the interaction. After about 50 Myr, they become\nnegligible (less than 0.1 mag) compared to the uncertainties related to the mass fraction\nfor each of the six populations. Hence, considering both major sources of uncertainties,\nthe error in the estimated magnitudes for the new knots (at the snapshot where they\nappear for the first time) can be as high as 0.75 mag. About three snapshots later this\nerror drops below 0.2-0.3 mag, since at that time the new population with an age of\n6.5 Myr represents a very small fraction in mass. About seven snapshots later the main\nsource of uncertainty comes from the mass fraction for each of the six populations, and\nthe magnitudes computed are reliable within less than 0.2 mag.\n2.2\n\nInteraction Phases Under Comparison\n\nAlthough a single 1:1 simulation was carried out, it is rather typical and characteristic\nof many observed real systems. For instance, NGC 7252, the Mice and The Antennae\ncan be modeled by roughly equal-mass mergers with high gas fractions, from 12.5 to 20%\n(Hibbard & Mihos 1995; Barnes 2004). Three out of the four double system ULIRGs in\nColina et al. (2005) also have a mass ratio of 1:1, and most ULIRGs in Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn et al.\n99\n\n\fChap. III Comparative Study with High Spatial Resolution Simulations\n(2007) are compatible with a mass ratio of 1:1 and 1:2. However, other parameters such\nas the orbit inclination differs significantly from system to system. On the other hand,\nthe observational data come from a sample of dozens of systems, surely with galaxies\nhaving different initial configurations. Therefore, we only expect to find general trends\nbetween both observed and simulated data.\nIn Chapter I (Section 1.2), we classified the (U)LIRG sample according to four interaction phases, depending on the optical morphology of the systems. A similar classification\nscheme to that in Veilleux et al. (2002) was followed, though with a few simplifications.\nAn age interval for each morphological class was assigned. Given the uncertainties involved when performing morphological classifications and in order to make a more realistic comparison, we assigned in the simulation a typical age to each morphological class\ndefined in Chapter I (Section 1.2) and considered a window of about 150 Myr to characterize the properties of each class. We then identify in the simulation typical ages (central\nages in the window) for the pre-merger, merger and post-merger interaction phases to be\n299, 585 and 988 Myr. We thus considered snapshots covering \u00b1 75 Myr to define the\ninteraction phase. Owing to computing time issues, the simulation in this study extends\nonly up to 1 Gyr. However, the duration of a merger can be more extended in time until\nthe system relaxes (e.g., simulations by Di Matteo et al. 2008 extend to longer than 2\nGyr). As a consequence, the comparison of this simulation with very relaxed galaxies\n(i.e., a very old elliptical galaxy) is not appropriate. Nevertheless, a comparison with\na (U)LIRG remnant, with past signs of interaction (e.g., outer asymmetries), no fully\nrelaxed, is not worrysome.\nSome galaxies were identified to be in a first-contact phase (before the first pericenter\npassage). This phase, corresponding to the first snapshots in the simulation, was not\nconsidered for this study because only a few simulated knots were detected (e.g., only\n34 knots in the snapshot number 8, at t=104 Myr). This unrealistic early scenario is\nthe consequence of how the star formation was implemented in the code, in such a way\nthat no star formation existed before the encounter. Therefore, the knots in the three\ninteraction phases pre-merger, merger and post-merger were compared for both sets of\ndata.\n\n3\n\nObserved Knots vs. Simulated Knots\n\n3.1\n3.1.1\n\nLuminosities and Colors\nPreliminary Considerations\n\nIn this section we aim at comparing the luminosities and color distributions of both\nthe simulated and observed knots during the interaction process. In order to understand\ndifferences and similarities we first make the following considerations:\n100\n\n\f3 - Observed Knots vs. Simulated Knots\n\n50\n\n60\n\nNumber\n\n40\n30\n\n20\n20\n\nglobal SFR (MO\u2022 y-1 )\n\nnew knots\ndestroyed knots\nknots that survive\nglobal SFR\n\n40\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\nt (Myr)\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n0\n1200\n\nFigure III.1: Number of simulated knots newly formed (black) and destroyed (dashed red) per\nsnapshot. The green dashed histogram shows how many of the formed knots at a given snapshot\nsurvive until the end of the simulation. The blue line shows the global SFR, which refers to the\ntotal mass of new particles formed into stars divided by the time extent of the snapshot. The\npeak of the global SFR, at about t = 150 Myr, occurs during the first pericenter passage. The\ndetection delay of the knots less massive than Mini = 108 M\u2299 has been corrected in the plot.\n\n\u2022 The time resolution of the simulation is 13 Myr, which means that any variation\nin luminosity and color during that time cannot be known.\n\u2022 According to the SB99 models and considering the previous limitation, during the\nfirst 100 Myr of the life of any knot, the color does not change significantly while\nthe luminosity does. We define this period as a \"constant-color\" phase.\n\u2022 After 100 Myr simulated knots become redder and fainter.\n\u2022 The knots that survive until the end of the simulation (long-lived knots) are formed\nearly on (see Fig. III.1), and it turns out tha they are also the most massive ones\n(see Belles et al. in preparation). Most of the other knots are destroyed before\nreaching 100 Myr. Thus, we can assume that the color distribution is actually\ndriven by the most massive knots in the simulation.\n101\n\n\fChap.

In contrast, (U)LIRGs are systems with high SFRs,\nindependently of the interaction phase.\nWith the knowledge of these facts, we are now able to investigate what occurs in each\ninteraction phase. The distributions of all the observables that we discuss in this section\nare shown in Fig. III.2. The averages values are given in Table III.1.\n\n3.1.2\n\nResults of the Simulation\n\nIn the simulation we are sampling knots typically more massive than 106 M\u2299 .\nAs observed in Fig. III.2, the mass completeness in the simulation is about\nlog (M/ M\u2299 )=6.2-6.5 depending on the phase. According to our magnitude estimates,\nthis translates into a luminosity threshold of MF 814W = [-12,-13].\nThe median value of the luminosity distributions of the simulated knots becomes\nfainter as the interaction proceeds (see Table III.1). Most of the short-lived knots are\nformed during the pre-merger phase (see Fig. III.1). Since they are rather young when\nthey disappear, a higher median value of the luminosity distribution is expected in more\nevolved phases. Moreover, at later phases (i.e., merger phase), the system relaxes and\nstarts to forget the initial conditions. As a consequence of stellar evolution (aging), the\nknots also become fainter. In the post-merger phase the system is practically dead and\naging effects dominate the fate of the system.\nThe colors become redder by about 1 mag (see Table III.1) and their distribution\n102\n\n\f3 - Observed Knots vs. Simulated Knots\n\n0.25 pre-merger\n\nN = 1157\n\nFraction\n\n0.20\n\n0.4\n\n0.15\n\n0.3\n\n0.10\n\n0.2\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.00\n\n0.0\n-1\n\n0.25 merger\n\nN = 832\n\nFraction\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0.15\n\n0.3\n\n0.10\n\n0.2\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.00\n\n0.0\n-1\n\n0.25 post-merger\n\nN = 171\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.10\n\n0.2\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.00\n5\n\n6\n7\n8\nlog (M/MO\u2022)\n\n9\n\n-20\n\n-15\n-10\nMF814W\n\n-5\n\n0.0\n-1\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n\n0.4\n\n0.15\n\n3\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\nN = 1575\n\n0.20\n\n2\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n\nN = 1731\n\n0.20\n\nFraction\n\n0.5\n\nN = 1907\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\n0\n\n1 2 3 4\nMF435W - MF814W\n\n5\n\nFigure III.2: Mass, I -band magnitude and color distributions for the simulated knots (in black)\nadding up the knots identified in each of the 11 snapshots in which we defined an interaction\nphase.

III Comparative Study with High Spatial Resolution Simulations\nbecomes more peaked (see Fig. III.2) as the interaction proceeds. In the simulation the\nSFR peaks just after the pre-merger phase starts, then it drops very rapidly in a period\nwhich already exceeds the \"constant color\" phase (see Fig. III.1). All the long-lived\nknots, which are likely to affect most significantly the color distribution, are formed.\nAs a consequence, basically blue populations (those which formed last), intermediatecolor populations and rather minor red populations are present in this early phase. In\nthe merger phase, as the system starts to relax and to forget the initial conditions, the\ncolor distribution is basically driven by the most massive knots (formed early on), and\nit starts to redden. Since the presence of a young population is hugely diminished, the\ncolor becomes less spread and peaks toward redder values. In the post-merger phase, the\nknots become even redder, since only aging effects play the role.\n3.1.3\n\nObservations vs. Simulations. General Comparison\n\nIn the previous section we estimated that the faint end of the luminosity distribution of\nthe simulated knots is affected by the limited mass resolution of the simulation. This can\nexplain why in the pre-merger and merger phases the luminosity of the observed knots\nis on average up to a factor of 15 (3 mag) lower than the luminosity of the simulated\nknots (see Table III.1). In fact, the luminosity threshold in the simulation is about this\namount higher than the luminosities at the peak of the distributions for the observed\nknots (see Fig. III.2), more or less the completeness limits.\nThe numerical simulation was designed to reproduce correctly the most massive structures, while it misses the low mass ones. Thus, if this less massive population were not\nmissed the median value of the luminosity distributions of observed and simulated knots\nwould approach. Once this bias understood, we see that the evolutionary trend due to\naging is also observed in (U)LIRGs during these two early phases (knots become fainter\nby about 0.7 mag).\nDuring the post-merger phase we see the following changes:\n\u2022 On the one hand, there is a good agreement between the observed and simulated\nluminosity distributions. In this case, the faintest knots in observed systems seem to\nhave disappeared. This might not be just a coincidence since, according to studies\non long-term evolution of cluster populations (e.g., Whitmore et al. 2007; Fall et al.\n2009), low mass clusters (populating the faint end of the luminosity distribution)\nhave more probabilities than the most massive ones to be disrupted. Thus, during\nthe pre-merger and merger phases this faint end of the luminosity distribution is\nnot sampled in the simulation by resolution issues. And in the post-merger phase\nit is probably not sampled because there are no low-mass knots to sample, since\nthey have dissolved in the interestelar medium.\n\u2022 On the other hand, the observed knots in this phase are more luminous (by about\n104\n\n\f3 - Observed Knots vs. Simulated Knots\n2 mag) than in previous phases, (see Fig. III.2 and Table III.1). We would expect\nthat, by aging effects (predicted by the simulations), the population became fainter.\nThe merging of smaller clusters into massive superclusters, as suggested by Kroupa\n(1998) and argued in Chapter II, could be responsible for the lack of fainter knots\nin post-mergers (U)LIRGs. As mentioned before, this process can not resolved in\nthe simulation given its spatial resolution.\nIn summary, both theoretical and observational data support that after the dynamical\nprocess of interaction in galaxy mergers the population is concentrated in the most\nmassive structures.\n3.1.4\n\nBroadening of the Color Distribution of Knots in (U)LIRGs\n\nThe color distributions of the observed knots become redder as the interaction proceeds, a behavior that the simulation predicts and it is explained by aging effects (see\nspecific values in Table III.1). However, the rather peaked color distributions of the simulated knots are quite different from the broader color distributions of the observed knots,\nas Fig. III.2 shows. These differences are actually expected, given the intrinsic characteristics of observations and simulations. In the following, we investigate the broadening\nof the color distribution of knots in (U)LIRGs.\nDespite the fact that no extinction is implemented in the simulations, a significant\npercentage of the observed knots are still bluer than the simulated knots at any interaction phase (blue wing; typically MF 435W -MF 814W < 0.5-1). As mentioned before,\n(U)LIRGs are known to preserve high SFRs independently of the interaction phase, while\nin the simulation the SFR is high only during the pre-merger phase (see Fig. III.1). Thus,\nthe star formation history of (U)LIRGs implies that the young knots, with blue colors, are\ncontinuously being formed in all phases. In contrast, the formation of knots is quickly suppressed in the simulations after the pre-merger phase. Moreover, given the time resolution\non the simulation, we are not able to sample colors as blue as MF 435W -MF 814W . 0.4,\nwhereas in (U)LIRGs younger population with bluer colors can exist.\nSince the effect of obscuration by dust is not implemented in the simulation, it is\nworth investigating the difference of the color distributions of simulated and observed\nknot to understand how the extinction is distributed in (U)LIRGs. In this case, we focus\non the red wing (i.e., MF 435W -MF 814W > 1.5) of the color distribution of the observed\nknots.\nWe investigated how the colors of the simulated knots would change if they were\nsuffering some extinction, so as to recover the red wing of the color distribution of the\nobserved knots. To that end, a test was performed by applying an extinction distribution\nwith a probability density function of an exponential decay with the form P(AV )=\u03bbe\u2212\u03bbAV\nto the simulated colors, where 1/\u03bb (ln2/\u03bb) represents the mean (median) value of the\n105\n\n\fChap. III Comparative Study with High Spatial Resolution Simulations\ndistribution. The test was performed from 1/\u03bb values of 0.01 to 2 mag and the best\nmatch by means of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS) of the simulated (with extinction)\nand observed color distribution was selected. The comparison between both distributions\nwas done from the peak of the initial distribution of the simulated colors toward redder\ncolors.\nWe were able to obtain similar shapes for the red wing of the observed and simulated knots (see green histograms in Fig. III.2). We derived the mean values of\n1/\u03bb = [1.3,1.4,1.1] mag for the pre-merger, merger and post-merger phase, respectively.\nWith this mean values, the simulated knots would suffer extinctions typically in the\nrange AV = 0-5 mag, with a probability distribution that peaks around 0-1 mag and\ndecays exponentially. Therefore, based on this result we conclude that the obscuration\nfor optically-selected knots in (U)LIRGs is likely to be distributed with a probability\ndensity function of an exponential decay. In fact, this range of extinctions is only slightly\nsmaller than that reported in (U)LIRGs in the optical and near infrared (Alonso-Herrero\net al. 2006; Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn et al. 2009a).\nWe estimated the corrected magnitude distribution of the simulated knots as if they\nwere affected by dust extinction (green histograms in Fig. III.2), using the obtained\nvalues of 1/\u03bb. Interestingly, the extinction values derived, similar to those observed in\n(U)LIRGs, do not contribute significantly to dimming the luminosity of the simulated\nknots (less than 1 mag on average).\n\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nMass and Luminosity Functions\nMF and LF of the Simulated Knots\n\nWe have the opportunity to study the evolution of the MF and the LF of the simulated\nknots with the merging process. In general, the MF and LF of young stellar objects (clusters, SSCs, YMCs, complexes of clusters) are well described as power-law distributions:\nLF\ndL\u03bb (LF). We applied the same methodology\ndN \u221d m\u2212\u03b1M F dm (MF) and dN \u221d L\u2212\u03b1\n\u03bb\nas in Chapter II, explained in Chapter I (Section 3.3), based on fitting equal-sized bin\ndistributions, to fit both the MF and LF. The lower mass and brightness for which the\nsimulated knots sample is complete was determined assuming a simple power law form\nfor the knot mass distribution. The uncertainties associated to the fit of the LF (shown\nin tables and figures) do not include other sources of systematic error (e.g., dropping\nthe brightest bins, adopting another method of binning, moving the magnitude limit).\nTherefore, like in Chapter II, we consider a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 dex.\nThe slope of the mass function of the simulated knots (\u03b1M F ) is typically 1.8\n(see Fig. III.3). Although a visual trend may be observed toward steeper slopes from\nthe pre-merger to the merger phase, given the uncertainties involved there is no clear\nevidence of an evolution of the slope with the phase of the merger.

In this case, there is a slight trend toward steeper \u03b1LF for the simulated knots as the merger proceeds up to about 500 Myr\n(see Fig. III.3, left). This trend is less significant for the filter F435W (see Table III.2).\nWe tried to fit empirically the values of \u03b1LF at each snapshot with a function of the form\n\u03b1LF = -10\u03b3t/t0 + c, a kind of an exponential decay (with index \u03b3). However, as shown\nin Fig. III.3 (left), the fit is not very well constrained since the dispersion is very high.\nHence, even though the trend can be real, within the uncertainties we cannot characterize\nit given the large dispersions in the different slopes.\nWe suspect the young population can be responsible for the variation of the slope of\nthe LF, since it can be up to a factor of 10-100 more luminous than an old population\n(i.e., 1 Gyr) with the same mass. (see Fig. I.7 in Chapter I). For instance, a population\nof 100 Myr can be up to 5 mag fainter than a population of less than 10 Myr having the\nsame mass. If there is a significant fraction of young population, it can overpopulate the\nbright end of the LF, making it flat.\nTo prove the validity of this hypothesis we explore the same plot (\u03b1LF vs. time)\nbut excluding those knots that appear for the first time in the simulation in the current\nsnapshot and in the previous one (i.e., normally the youngest knots). We refer to them\nas the young simulated knots. When these young knots are excluded from the fit, the\ntrend tends to disappear in both filters (Fig. III.3, right). Since in the simulation the\nknot formation rate is very low during the merger and the post-merger phases, the\nnumber of young simulated knots is negligible then compared to the pre-merger phase\n(see Table III.2). Therefore, these youngest knots are the responsible for overpopulating\nthe bright end of the LF, which makes its slope flatten.\n108\n\n\f3 - Observed Knots vs. Simulated Knots\n3.2.2\n\nLF: Models vs. Observations\n\nIn Chapter II we observed (including the first contact phase in the analysis) a\nmarginally significant indication that for the red filter the LF evolves during the interaction process (see also Table III.2). For the blue filter the slope does not change\nperceptibly in the observed sample of (U)LIRGs. This variation of the slope could have\nthe same origin in both observations and simulations. Then, even if there is substantial active star formation (i.e., young population) in all interacting phases in (U)LIRGs,\nthis may imply that in early phases the young population represents more percentage\n(NY \u223c 5-20%; see Table III.2) with respect to the total population than in most evolved\nphases (NY \u223c 1-2%) in the optical band. The contribution of this overpopulation of\nyoung knots would flatten the slope of the LF in early interaction phases.\nIn absolute values, the LFs in the observed sample of (U)LIRGs are systematically\nabout 0.1 dex steeper than in the simulation, as shown in Table III.2. Given the uncertainties involved (specially the systematics), this is not very relevant. In any case,\nthe reasons why the slopes are systematically different can be: (1) the LFs of the simulated knots were not been corrected for incompleteness (if corrected, the slopes would\nbe steeper); (2) the spatial resolution is a bit lower in the simulation (if improved, the\nslopes would be steeper); (3) the knots do not suffer internal extinction (if they did, the\nslopes would flatten).\nIs this variation of the slope with the interaction phase observed in other mergers?\nIn other interacting galaxies the slope is steeper, its value being around 2 (Schweizer\net al. 1996; Miller et al. 1997; Whitmore et al. 1999; Gieles et al. 2006; Haas et al.\n2008;Peterson et al. 2009; Santiago-Cort\u00e9s et al. 2010). If we take individual snapshots\nin the simulation, the slopes can vary considerably within the same interaction phase\n(see Fig. III.3). The trend is detected only when we consider the whole range from\n200 Myr to about 500 Myr. Thus, measuring steeper slopes than the predicted by the\nsimulation at early phases when studying individual systems would be possible. Caution\nmust be taken with these comparisons because the slopes computed in other interacting\ngalaxies correspond in general to the LF of individual clusters. Since in this study we\ndo not have enough spatial resolution to resolve individual clusters, the slopes of the\nLF of the simulated knots can be distorted. In fact, this happens as well in the sample\nof observed (U)LIRGs. In Chapter II (Section 3) we made a simulation to understand\nhow the slope behaves under the situation of not having enough angular resolution, and\nconcluded that it can be systematically flattened by about 0.1 dex.\n\n3.2.3\n\nWhat Traces the Variation of the Slope of the LF?\n\nWe have seen that the slight variation of the slope of the LF can be explained by\nthe presence of a larger fraction of young population in early phases of the interaction\ncompared to more evolved phases. But, does that mean that the SFR of the system\n109\n\n\fChap. III Comparative Study with High Spatial Resolution Simulations\ntraces the slope of the LF? This is a key issue, since (U)LIRGs are known to have high\nSFRs, but in advanced phases (merger and post-merger) the slope of the LF of the knots\nis the same.\nAt t = 250 Myr the global SFR in the simulation drops dramatically (see Fig. III.1).\nThe shape of the histogram that represents the knot formation rate (black histogram\nin Fig. III.1) is similar, though wider. It is a difference not related to the detection threshold of the knot, because the black histogram was corrected for that. At t = 300 Myr\nthe global SFR is already very low (less than 10 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) compared to the peak\n(PeakSF R \u223c 50 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ), and the slope of the LF can still be quite flat (\u03b1LF = 1.5-1.6).\nYet, the knot formation rate remains still high. Therefore, the variation of the slope of\nthe LF is likely to be related only to the knot formation rate, and not necessarily to the\nglobal SFR. This implies that if a system has a high SFR (i.e., a LIRG or a ULIRG), but\nthe current star formation is concentrated on very few knots or mainly obscured (i.e., not\nobservable in the optical), the young population does surely not affect the slope of the\nLF. Might this be occurring in advanced phases (merger and post-merger) in (U)LIRGs?\n\n3.3\n\nEvolution of the Spatial Distributions of the Properties of the Knots\n\nThe comparison of the evolution of the spatial distributions of the simulated and\nobserved knots as a function of the interaction phase can provide additional information\non the physical processes that govern the production of star clusters. For this study,\nwe defined 6 bins of galactocentric distance, each separated by a factor of 2 from d=2.5\nkpc: 0-2.5, 2.5-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40, and 40-80 kpc. The distances for the observed knots\nin Fig. III.4 correspond to projected galactocentric distances. However, in the simulation\nwe have access to the real galactocentric distance of the knots at any given snapshot (the\n3D-distance). We thus study the spatial distribution of the photometric properties using\nthe 3D-distance and the 3 projected distances on each of the three planes in the simulation\n(XY, XZ and YZ). In general, either if we are dealing with the 3D or with any projected\ndistance the trends in the simulation do not change significantly. In any case, we decided\nto make the comparison with the observations taking a projected distance because we\nhave more statistics at smaller galactocentric distances and the distances measured in\nthe sample of (U)LIRGs are also projected.\nFinally, if there is not enough statistics in a given distance bin, then the mean value\n(red and green in Fig. III.5 and Fig. III.6) is not shown in the plot.\n\n3.3.1\n\nSpatial Distribution of the Knots\n\nThe spatial distribution of the observed and simulated knots is significantly different\nat any given interaction phase. While more than 60% of the total number of knots are\nwithin a projected distance of 5 kpc in the sample of (U)LIRGs, only about 20% are\n110\n\n\f3 - Observed Knots vs. Simulated Knots\n\nObserved knots\npre-merger\n\n0.4\nFraction\n\nFraction\n\n0.4\n\nSimulated knots\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\nmerger\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\nmerger\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\npost-merger\n\n0.4\nFraction\n\nFraction\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n0.0\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n0.0\nFraction\n\nFraction\n\n0.4\n\npre-merger\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\npost-merger\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\n0 2.5 5 10 20 40 80\nRadius (kpc)\n\n0 2.5 5 10 20 40 80\nRadius (kpc)\n\nFigure III.4: Spatial distribution of the observed (left) and simulated (right) knots. For the\nsimulated knots the distance correspond to the projected galactocentric distance in the XY\nplane.\n\nlocated below that distance in the simulation. Recent hydrodynamic simulations of a\nmajor merger (Teyssier et al. 2010) showed that models limited in spatial and mass\nresolution, and/or the absence of a model for gas cooling below \u223c104 K, cannot resolve\nproperly the process of gas fragmentation into massive clouds and rapid star formation.\nTeyssier and co-workers ran their simulation in a low and high resolution mode, using\na softening of \u2206x=96 and 12 pc, respectively. The ISM becomes much more clumpy in\nthe high resolution mode, especially in the inner regions and then more clusters/knots\ncan be formed. Furthermore, gas is more extended, allowing formation of SSCs at higher\nradii.\nIn the simulation by Bournaud et al. (Bournaud et al. 2008b), even if the spatial\nresolution is still very high, it is three times lower than the high resolution mode in\n111\n\n\fChap. III Comparative Study with High Spatial Resolution Simulations\nthe hydrodynamic simulations mentioned and neglect the thermal pressure of the gasa .\nAdditionally, it may be more difficult to detect low-mass knots in the central regions\nof the simulated galaxies given the large diffuse background there. Therefore, we have\nto be cautious when comparing the evolution of spatial distributions of the magnitudes\nand colors of the observed and simulated knots at galactocentric distances smaller than\nd < 5 kpc.\n3.3.2\n\nEvolution of the Spatial Distribution of Luminosities.\n\nDuring the pre-merger phase, we see a trend of the luminosities of the simulated knots\nwith the radial distance, in such a way that they become fainter as the distance increases.\nAs the interaction proceeds, in the merger phase this trend (if real) is very weak. By the\ntime the post-merger phase is reached the spatial distribution of luminosities is completely\nflat (see Fig. III.5). Both the spatial distribution of magnitudes and masses follow the\nsame trends at any given interaction phase. This could indicate that the star formation in\nthe simulation is not centrally concentrated. However, if we select the youngest simulated\nknots (new knots, circled light blue dots in Fig. III.5) we realize that during the premerger phase, close to the peak of the SFR, 45% are formed within the central 5 kpc and\nthe median value of their mass distribution corresponds to log (M/ M\u2299 ) = 7.25 against\nthe value of 6.57 for knots located at larger distances. Later on, this percentage drops\nto 30% and 0% in the merger and post-merger phase, respectively. In the merger phase\nthe new knots in the central 5 kpc are still significantly more massive than the more\nexternal ones (log (M/ M\u2299 ) of 6.55 against 6.18). Hence, the trend can be due to two\ncontributions:\n(1) the star formation in the simulation is more concentrated in the nuclear regions\nduring the first phases of the interaction. The knots are more luminous there, since\nthey are on average younger than knots in the outermost regions.\n(2) the most massive knots tend to form in the central regions. Thus, they are also more\nmassive, i.e., more luminous there.\nThe trend tends to disappear as the interaction proceeds since at later phases the knot\nformation process (though not very strong given that SFR is very low in the simulation)\nis more efficient in the external regions (i.e., in tidal tails). Younger population will\nbe more luminous being even less massive there. Note that given the limitation of the\nsimulation on forming knots in the innermost regions, discussed in the previous section,\na\n\nThe sticky particle scheme used in this simulation assumes that the turbulent pressure dominates:\nthe turbulent pressure and turbulence dissipation are modeled by the interactions of sticky particles,\nand the thermal pressure is neglected. This may be a realistic sub-grid treatment for molecular and\ncool/cold atomic phases (which are dominated by supersonic turbulence, e.g., Burkert & Bodenheimer\n1996) but the more important thermal pressure in warmer phases (\u2265 104 K) is neglected.\n\n112\n\n\f3 - Observed Knots vs. Simulated Knots\n\n113\n\nFigure III.5: Spatial distribution of the mass, luminosity and color for the simulated knots at the three interaction phases defined\nin this study. In each case we plot the values in the 11 snapshots for which the interaction phases have been defined, and taking the\nprojected galactocentric distance in the XY plane (black dots). Those dots circled in light blue refer to the knots that appear for the\nfirst time in one of the 11 snapshots that define an interaction phase.

The blue horizontal dashed lines on the magnitude distribution plots give the average 90% completeness for\nthe inner (i.e., d < 2.5 kpc) and outer (i.e., d > 2.5 kpc) knots.\n\n\f4 - Summary and Conclusions\nthe percentages given should be considered as a lower limits. Thus, in the pre-merger\nphase, we expect that actually more than half of the knots are formed within the central\n5 kpc instead of 45%. However, given this limitation we cannot quantify by how much.\nIn the sample of (U)LIRGs, a similar variation to that in the pre-merger phase of the\nsimulation of luminosities with distance persists up to the merger phase (see Fig. III.6).\nActually, part of this trend can be due to incompleteness in detecting the knots in the\ncentral regions of the galaxies, where the surface brightness of the underlying background\nis high. For that reason, knots fainter than the 90% completeness limit are not detected.\nNevertheless, there are not very bright knots in the outermost regions, independently of\nthe completeness limit. Therefore, this variation might remain, meaning that on average\nthe brightest objects are located within the first few kpc of the galaxies at any given\ninteraction phase, as the simulation predicts only for the pre-merger phase. Then, why\ndoes the trend remain up to more advanced phases in (U)LIRGs? These systems can\nsustain high rates of star formation at any interaction phase. If we assume that this\nvariation has the same origin as in the simulation, then at least half of the current star\nformation is always concentrated within 5 kpc, no matter which phase of the interaction\nthe systems are undergoing (the variation is kept during the whole interaction). This has\nbeen observed in galaxies at different phases of interaction, like in the central regions of\nthe Antennae (Mengel et al. 2008; Whitmore et al. 2010 and in NGC 7252 (Miller et al.\n1997). As a main conclusion, our theoretical and empirical data suggest that whenever\nthe global star formation rate is high in interacting environments, it is likely to be mainly\nconcentrated in the central regions.\n\n3.3.3\n\nEvolution of the Spatial Distribution of Colors.\n\nAs we have seen before, the young knots in the simulation are more concentrated\nduring the pre-merger phase. The spatial distribution of colors confirm this, since younger\nknots are bluer, and knots with bluer color are located in central regions during this phase\n(Fig. III.5). In contrast, the knots in (U)LIRGs show a trend toward redder colors in the\ninner regions, in the pre-merger and post-merger phase (Fig. III.6). This is an indication\nof higher internal extinction in the central regions of this systems. Based on the previous\nconclusion that most of the current star formation appears to be concentrated toward\nthe central regions in (U)LIRGs, then the extinction must be even more severe, as it has\nbeen measured in these kind of systems (e.g., Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006; Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn\net al. 2009b).\n\n4\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThis Chapter shows the results of the first direct comparison of the star formation\nin interacting galaxies obtained with high spatial resolution numerical simulations with\n115\n\n\fChap. III Comparative Study with High Spatial Resolution Simulations\nobservations of galaxy interactions on scales of 30-100 pc. We have compared the evolution of the observed photometric properties of the stellar regions (knots) in a sample\nof 22 (U)LIRGs with those predicted in a simulation of a major merger of two galaxies\nwith roughly equal initial mass ratio and large fraction of gas, similar to some observed\nsystems. Three different interaction phases have been defined: pre-merger, merger and\npost-merger, occurring in the simulation at about t = 200-400 Myr, 500-700 Myr and\n1 Gyr, respectively. The high resolution model reproduces and/or explains in a coherent\nway some observed properties of the star-forming regions in major mergers. We draw\nthe following conclusions:\n1. As a consequence of the aging of the knots during the merging process, observations and simulations show an evolutionary trend in which knots become fainter\nand have redder MF 435W -MF 814W colors as the interaction proceeds from the\npre-merger to the merger phase. Later on, during the post-merger phase, there\nis theoretical and observational evidence that only the most massive structures\nremain, although it is still not clear how they form: (i) as individual massive\nentities; (ii) or after a merging process of clusters into superclusters.\n2. The color distribution of the simulated knots span a very narrow range\n(MF 435W -MF 814W = 0.5-2) compared to the observed color distribution of the\nknots in (U)LIRGs. To reproduce the observed color distribution an extinction\ncorrection has to be applied to the colors of the simulated knots, characterized\nby an exponential probability density function of median value AV = 1.1-1.4 mag.\nThe derived typical obscuration peaks at AV = 0-1 mag, and ranges from 0 to 5\nmag.\n3. The shape of the mass function (MF) of the simulated knots is practically constant\nalong the interaction process. The derived slope of the MF, typically \u03b1M F \u223c 1.8,\nis similar to that obtained for observed individual star clusters in less luminous\ninteracting environments.\n4. The slope of the luminosity function (LF) may evolve throughout the interaction\nprocess. A weak trend toward steeper slopes of the LFs of the simulated knots is\nobserved during the pre-merger phase up to the merger phase, when it stabilizes\naround \u03b1LF = 1.8-1.9. According to the simulation, this slight variation is likely\nto be due to high knot formation rates at early phases of the interaction with\nrespect to the knot formation rates at late phases. However, there is not clear\nevidence that it is correlated with the global star formation rate of the system.\nThe same origin could explain the slight variation of the LF of the observed knots\nin (U)LIRGs provided that the global star formation is concentrated in few knots\nduring intermediate and advanced interaction phases.\n\n116\n\n\f4 - Summary and Conclusions\n5. Numerical issues considered on the formation and detection of knots at small\ndistances (galactocentric distance d < 5 kpc), the simulation confirms that when\nthe global star formation is high (pre-merger) the star formation is mainly\nconcentrated in the central regions. The spatial distribution of luminosities in\n(U)LIRGs suggests that the star formation in these systems is mainly concentrated\nin the central regions in general (no matter the interaction phase), in agreement\nwith previous studies of these systems.\n\n117\n\n\f\fIV\nTDG Candidates in Low-z (U)LIRGs\nChapter\n\nOverview\nIn this Chapter we use the combination of the photometric\ndata from previous chapters, and spectroscopic data to investigate the nature of the extreme extranuclear young population,\ndetected in our sample of (U)LIRGs in the context of TDG formation. We make use of several criteria (e.g., H\u03b1 luminosity,\ndynamical mass content, signs of self-gravitation, etc.) to investigate their nature as TDGs and the chances of survival as\nlong-lived entities. The knowledge of the production rate of\nlong-lived TDGs for the (U)LIRG class also provides clues to\nconstrain the dwarf galaxy formation at high redshifts.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nInteracting systems (and remnants) constitute the optimal environment for finding the\nso-called tidal dwarf galaxies (TDG): a self-gravitating entity of dwarf-galaxy mass built\nfrom the tidal material expelled during interactions (General Introduction, Section 2.2).\nAlthough many studies devoted to searching and characterizing TDGs in nearby interacting systems have been carried out in the past few decades, only a few searches for\nTDG candidates have been performed to date in LIRGs and ULIRGs.\nIn previous chapters we have disentangled the photometric properties of knots of\nstar formation in a representative sample of (U)LIRGs. Interestingly, very bright (i.e.,\nMF 814W < -12.5) and blue (i.e., MF 435W -MF 814W < 0.5) knots along the tidal tails and\nat the tip, indicative of massive (i.e., M = 104 -106 M\u2299 ) young populations, have been\ndetected in those systems. On the basis of previous studies of nearby interacting galaxies\n(e.g., Duc et al. 1997, 1998; Weilbacher et al. 2000; Temporin et al. 2003; Monreal-Ibero\net al. 2007), TDG candidates are normally identified as extreme star forming regions\nin tidal tails. With the additional aid of optical IFS data, this chapter is devoted to\n119\n\n\fChap. IV\n\nTDG Candidates in Low-z (U)LIRGs\n\nstudying more in detail extranuclear H\u03b1-emitting clumps linked to the knots and associations investigated in previous chapters. With dynamical masses up to 108 -1010 M\u2299 ,\nthese knots and associations represent the most massive case of young star formation in\n(U)LIRGs, toward the typical range of dwarf galaxies.\nThis Chapter extends the previous study of Monreal-Ibero et al. (2007) by including\ngalaxies in the LIRG class and with additional (i.e., B -band) and more sensitive photometric data. Section 2 presents the subsample with available photometric and IFS data\nsimultaneously. We then identify and characterize the luminosities, colors, metallicities,\netc., of extranuclear H\u03b1-emitting complexes in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively. In\nsection Section 5 we select the complexes that are most likely to constitute TDG candidates and discuss their total mass content and the likeliness of the survival of these\nregions as future TDGs , and the implications for the formation of TDGs at high-z.\nFinally, we draw our conclusions in Section 6.\n\n2\n\nThe Subsample\n\nThe initial sample for this study is presented in Chapter I (Section 1.1). Since this\nstudy combines our photometric (see Chapter I, Section 2.1) and spectroscopic (see Chapter I, Section 2.2) data, we have selected those systems with available data in both sets\nsimultaneously at the moment of the analysis. That is a total of 27 systems.\nAs explained in section Section 3.1, regions of interest were selected as any high surface\nbrightness compact region (H\u03b1 clumps) in the emission line maps (obtained from the\nIFS data) at a projected distance from the nucleus of the galaxy greater than 2.5 kpc,\nand associated with one or several of the star-forming regions (knots) in the ACS images.\nOn the basis of these criteria, H\u03b1-emitting complexes have been identified in 11 systems.\nWe did not identify other complexes in the remaining sample basically for two reasons:\n(1) based on the above criteria, in some systems knots are detected but no H\u03b1 emission is\nfound in the outskirts in the H\u03b1 line map (e.g., in IRAS 22491-1808); (2) the FoV covered\nby the IFS data is not large enough to encompass the full extent of some systems. Hence,\nthe nature of blue knots along the tidal tail and at its tip, where TDGs are normally\nfound, cannot be assessed using the IFS data.\nTherefore, the final subsample consists of 11 systems with at least one region of\ninterest (see table Table IV.1), or more precisely 7 LIRGs and 4 ULIRGs. For completeness we also include in our tables the results of Monreal-Ibero et al. (2007) for IRAS\n16007+3743, for which an image in the B photometric band was unavailable. According\nto the classification scheme defined in Chapter I (Section 1.2), IRAS 04315-0840, IRAS\n08355-4944, IRAS F10038-3338 and IRAS 15250+3609 are in an advanced phase of the\nmerger (merger phase) where the nuclei have apparently coalesced. However, the tails\nare still recognizable in the images, in some cases very prominently. The rest of the\nsystems are in earlier stages of the merging process, first contact or pre-merger phases,\n120\n\n\f3 - H\u03b1-Emitting Complexes in (U)LIRGs\naccording to the classification scheme we use.\n\n3\n\nH\u03b1 -Emitting Complexes in (U)LIRGs\n\n3.1\n\nIdentification\n\nThe identification of the stellar population that ionizes the surrounding interstellar\nmedium, and subsequently produces the H\u03b1 emission, is not necessarily straightforward.\nDepending on the resolution of the data and the contamination of the field by other\nionizing sources, the establishment of this matching is not always possible. We first\nselected bright condensations in the H\u03b1 maps that were coincident with at least one blue\nknot in the F435W ACS images. We chose to use these high resolution images instead\nof the F814W ones because the most likely responsible for the ionization were detected\nmost efficiently with the blue filter.\nWe defined a complex of young star formation as an H\u03b1 clump (a set of spaxelsa )\nthat had coincident position with one or several knots identified in the HST images. In\ngeneral, around 12 spaxels (e.g., 3 \u00d7 4 spaxels) are needed to define a complex, depending\non how isolated it is and the extent of the H\u03b1 emission before it is affected by another\nsource or diffuse nuclear emission. In one case (IRAS 08572N) a prominent H\u03b1 peak is\nobserved at around 7 kpc west of the northern nucleus, but with no corresponding region\nin the HST images.\nWe visually inspected each H\u03b1 map and found 11 systems with prominent peaks apart\nfrom the nuclei (see Fig. IV.1). We defined the inner complexes as those located within\na projected distance of 2.5 kpc to the closest nucleus, and the outer complexes as those\nfurther out than 2.5 kpc. Given the resolution of the spectral maps, approximately 182\npixels on the ACS images correspond to 12 spaxel on the INTEGRAL maps, and 132\npixels to 12 spaxel on the VIMOS maps. Thus, the identification of the ionizing stellar\nknots is highly uncertain in inner complexes, since the H\u03b1 flux there is very much likely\nto be contaminated by flux from nearby knots. Together with the motivation of searching\nfor TDG candidates, they constitute the main reason why we exclude these complexes\nfrom the study. Therefore, we focus on the outer complexes. Moreover, we do not select\ncomplexes in rings of star formation (i.e., those at the external ring in IRAS 060762139), since they are not normally associated with tidal forces, hence with TDGs. All\nconsidered, we identified for our study 31 outer young, H\u03b1 -emitting complexes of star\nformation, shown in Fig. IV.1 and Fig. IV.2.\na\n\nAs explained in Chapter I (Section 2.2), a spaxel corresponds to the spatial element from which we\nhave one independent spectrum, and it is used to reconstruct the map.\n\n121\n\n\fIRAS 04315-0840\n\nIRAS 06076-2139\n\nIRAS 07027-6011 S\n\nIRAS 08355-4944\n\nIRAS 08572+3915 N\n\nC2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-5\n-10\n\n\u2206\u03b4 (arcsec)\n\n10\n\nC6 C5 C4\nC3\nC2\nC1\n\n-10\n\nC1\n\n15\n\n15\nC1\n\n10\n\nC1\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-10\n\n-10\n\n10 5 0 -5 -10 -15\nIRAS F10038-3338\n\n10 5 0 -5 -10 -15\nIRAS 12112+0305\n\n10 5 0 -5 -10 -15\nIRAS 14348-1447\n\n15\n\n15\n\n15\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\nC4\n\nC1\n\n0\n-5\n\n0\nC3 C2\n\n-5\n\nC1\n\n-10\n\n-10\n10 5 0 -5 -10 -15\nIRAS F18093-5744 N\n\n15\n\nC2\n\nC1\n\n10 5 0 -5 -10 -15\nIRAS 15250+3609\n\n15\n\n0\nC3\n\nC2\n\n-10\n\nC1\n\nC3 C2\n\n0\n\nC1\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-10\n\nC1\n\nC4\n\nC1\n\n10 5 0 -5 -10 -15\nIRAS 23128-5919\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-10\n\n-10\n10 5 0 -5 -10 -15\n\u2206\u03b1 (arcsec)\n\n10 5\n\n0\n\n-5 -10 -15\n\n10 5\n\n0\n\n-5 -10 -15\n\n15\n\n10\n\nC1\n\n0\nC4\n\n-5\n\n10 5 0 -5 -10 -15\nIRAS F18093-5744 C\n15\n\nC3\n\n10 5 0 -5 -10 -15\n\u2206\u03b1 (arcsec)\n\nChap.

IV\n3.2\n\nTDG Candidates in Low-z (U)LIRGs\n\nStructure and Location\n\nOwing to the higher angular resolution of the HST images, we identified the\nH\u03b1 clumps (observed in the spectral maps) with a complex of star-forming knots (observed in the photometric images). The number of knots in the ACS image per H\u03b1 complex is on average 2.2. However, the structure of these clumps is in general quite simple.\nAs can be seen in Fig. IV.2 and Table IV.1, the position of the H\u03b1 -emission peak is\ncoincident or quite close to a prominent blue knot. In most cases, only one bright knot is\nobserved within the area defined for the H\u03b1 complex (e.g., C1 in IRAS 08572+3915 N) or\na centered bright knot plus a few fainter knots located at the border of the H\u03b1 complex\n(e.g., C1 in IRAS 04315-0840). In a few cases, the structure is quite complex, with several\nbright blue knots spread inside the area of the clump (e.g., C2 in IRAS 12112+0305).\nWhen characterizing the H\u03b1 complexes, given the rich structure of some of them, we\nassume that every knot detected in the HST images within the area of the complex is\nan H\u03b1 emitter. With the current data, the estimate of the contribution of each knot to\nthe total H\u03b1 emission or if a knot is not an H\u03b1 emitter (i.e., it is older than 10 Myr, at\nwhich the H\u03b1 emission declines abruptly) for all the complexes, is not possible. We also\nassume that only the detected knots are responsible for the whole H\u03b1 emission of the\ncomplex.\nThe H\u03b1 complexes are located at distances in the range 3.3-13.7 kpc from the nucleus\nof the parent galaxy, with a median value of 9.3 kpc (see Table IV.1). These distances,\nowing to projection effects, represent lower limits to the real distances. They are relatively\nclose distances to the parent galaxy compared to those of the TDG candidates (35-100\nkpc; e.g., Duc & Mirabel 1998; Sheen et al. 2009; Hancock et al. 2009), although some\nTDG candidates have been reported at such distances (e.g., Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u00edlchez\n2001; Weilbacher et al. 2003). At these distances, some of the H\u03b1 complexes lie along the\ntidal tails (see Fig. IV.1), and the diffuse low surface brightness H\u03b1 emission (which is\nnot subtracted in our measurements of the H\u03b1 flux) is either undetected or considerably\ndiminished, thus does not contaminate the emission from the knots. Others also appear\nto be simply a non-nuclear giant HII region.\n\n4\n\nCharacterization of the H\u03b1 -Emitting Complexes\n\nWe now investigate the physical properties of the bright H\u03b1 complexes identified. This\ncharacterization includes the analysis of the stellar continuum magnitudes (MF 435W and\ncolor), spectral features (H\u03b1 luminosity and equivalent width), as well as physical sizes\nand an estimate of the metallicity. All these observables are compared to those measured\nin extragalactic HII regions, dwarf galaxies, and other TDG candidates.\n124\n\n\f4 - Characterization of the H\u03b1-Emitting Complexes\n4.1\n4.1.1\n\nPhotometric Properties of the Complexes\nBroad-band Luminosities and Colors\n\nThe integrated blue absolute magnitude MF 435W and color (MF 435W -MF 814W ) of the\nyoung stellar population within the H\u03b1 complexes were estimated by adding all the flux\nof the knots inside a complex. We cover a magnitude range MF 435W = [-9.32, -15.77],\nand a color range MF 435W -MF 814W = [-0.23, 2.34] (see Table IV.1). The median values\ncorrespond to -12.06 and 0.63 mag, respectively. The typical uncertainties are between\n0.05 and 0.1 mag.\nThe integrated luminosities are in general higher than in embedded clusters in nearby\nextragalactic HII regions in spirals (Bresolin & Kennicutt 1997) and more typical of those\nfound in extragalactic giant HII regions (Mayya 1994; Ferreiro et al. 2008). Although\nearly studies in extragalactic HII regions only focus on nearby galaxies (DL < 20 Mpc),\nFerreiro and co-workers observed minor mergers at distances (DL = 40-170 Mpc) similar\nto our sample, detecting also only the most luminous giant HII regions, the external ones\ncovering the range MB \u2243 [-11.7, -17.4], typically 2 magnitudes more luminous than the\nrange sampled in this study.\nNearby dwarf galaxies are typically more luminous than B . -13.0, with colors in the range MF 435W -MF 814W = 0.7-2 (Hunter & Gallagher 1986; Marlowe et al.\n1997; Cair\u00f3s et al. 2001). In addition, the luminosities observed for nearby (Duc\net al. 1997, 1998, 2007) and more distant (Weilbacher et al. 2000; Temporin et al.\n2003) TDG candidates are generally more luminous than B = -10.65, as for most of our\nH\u03b1 complexes.\nThe integrated broad-band luminosities of the embedded stellar population in our\nH\u03b1 complexes is, therefore, compatible with the luminosities measured in giant HII regions and TDG candidates.\n\n4.1.2\n\nSizes and Compactnesses\n\nOwing to the higher angular resolution of the HST images, estimates of the sizes and\ncompactnesses of the H\u03b1 emitting clumps were derived from the ACS images. All the\nknots within a complex were assumed to represent the ionizing stellar population. We\nthen added the area of each knot (derived as explained in Chapter I, Section 3.1) within\nan H\u03b1 complex, computingpa total area AT . With this area, we derived an equivalent\ntotal radius, given by r = AT /\u03c0 (see Table IV.1). Had we used the spectral maps to\nmeasure the radius of the complexes (rH\u03b1 in Table IV.1), we would have overestimated\nit in general by more than a factor of two.

We again used the\nHST images for this determination. In this case, since in most cases one knot dominates\nthe total broad-band luminosity within the complex, we identified the effective radius\nof an H\u03b1 complex with the effective radius of the most luminous knot (derived as explained in Chapter I, Section 3.1). In complexes where more than one knot dominates\nthe luminosity, this approach leads to an underestimate of the effective radius.\nThe effective radii of complexes observed with VIMOS are smaller than 100 pc\n(see Table IV.1), from 20 pc to about 80 pc. For those observed with INTEGRAL,\nthe values range from 100 pc to about 300 pc. These sizes are in general larger than the\neffective radii of the so-called ultra compact dwarf galaxies (e.g., Dabringhausen et al.\n2008), similar to those in giant HII regions (e.g.,Rela\u00f1o et al. 2005; Rozas et al. 2006a),\nand within the range of the smallest blue compact dwarf galaxies (with reff = 0.2-1.8 kpc;\ne.g., Cair\u00f3s et al. 2003; Papaderos et al. 2006; Amor\u00edn et al. 2009) and Local, NGC\n1407, and Leo groups (with reff \u223c 0.3-1 kpc; Mateo 1998; Forbes et al. 2011).\nThe ratio of the effective to equivalent radii gives an idea of the compactness of a\ncertain complex. They are very compact, with a ratio of typically reff /r = 0.2, ranging\nfrom 0.15 to 0.6.\n\n4.2\n\nH\u03b1 Luminosities and Equivalent Widths\n\nBoth H\u03b1 flux and equivalent width measurements (EW) were obtained for the 31\nH\u03b1 complexes. Their observed H\u03b1 luminosity is typically higher than 1039 erg s\u22121\n(see Table IV.2). The luminosity of about 20% of them is even higher than 1040 erg s\u22121 .\nThe median value of the H\u03b1 flux is 2.9\u00d71039 erg s\u22121 . Monreal-Ibero et al. (2007)\nalso measured the H\u03b1 fluxes for four of our systems with INTEGRAL data (in IRAS\n08572+3915 only for the northern pointing) and most of them are systematically lower\nby up to a half. The discrepancy occurs because they used apertures of 0.5\u2032\u2032 or 1.0\u2032\u2032 ,\nwhereas we have integrated the fluxes of several spaxels, considering a greater effective\naperture (one spaxel on INTEGRAL maps already corresponds to an aperture of 0.45\u2032\u2032 in\nradius). In the case of IRAS 12112+0305, we grouped their kc and k1 regions and did\nnot consider R2 because it is too close to the northern nucleus, which makes its H\u03b1 flux\ndetermination very uncertain.\nFig. IV.3 (left) compares the H\u03b1 luminosities and sizes of our complexes with those of\nextragalactic HII regions, H\u03b1 complexes in nearby galaxies, TDG candidates, and dwarf\ngalaxies. This plot shows that using the H\u03b1 luminosity alone to establish the nature of a\ngiven object might be misleading. For instance, the complexes of star formation in The\n127\n\n\fChap.

Our complexes are\ntypically located where the giant extragalactic HII regions and the dwarf-type objects lie\non the plot.\nWe also estimated the total equivalent width of a given complex from the EW and the\nH\u03b1 spectroscopic line maps. Since in a spaxel the EW \u221d Flux H\u03b1 / Flux continuum, we\nfirst determined the continuum per spaxel. We then integrated all the continuum within\na complex to compute the total continuum of the complex. Finally, we divided the total\nH\u03b1 flux by the total continuum flux for each complex. Their integrated EW span a\nrange of two orders of magnitudes, from 4.1\u00c5 to about 170\u00c5 (see Table IV.2). For each\ncomplex, we also give the value of the spaxel with the highest EW (EWpeak ). The highest\nvalue corresponds to EWpeak = 374\u00c5. Its median value (< EWpeak > = 85\u00c5) doubles\nthe median value of the integrated EW computed for the complexes. The H\u03b1 equivalent\nwidths derived, which is indicative of a very young stellar population, are comparable to\nthose measured for extragalactic HII regions and TDG candidates (see Fig. IV.3, right).\nPeak EW\nwas defined for each complex, where Peak EW refers to EWpeak .\nThe ratio EW\n(H\u03b1)\nThis ratio helps us understand how the ionizing population is distributed. If two complexes have a similar underlying old population, the ionizing population in the one with\nthe larger ratio is probably more concentrated (i.e., less knots) than the other with the\nsmaller ratio. And if it is less concentrated (i.e., has more knots), most of the knots are\n\n129\n\n\fChap.

The line shows the correlation found\nby van Zee. Only the luminosities given by Pilyugin are corrected from internal extinction. For\nthose H\u03b1 complexes for which an estimate of the extinction has been made (see Section 5.2.1),\nthe metallicity-luminosity relation is also shown (dots with dashed line errors).\n\nprobably somewhat older (low EW) and only a few are very young (high EW), leading to\nPeak EW\nan older average population. In fact, the complexes with large ratios ( EW\n& 3) have\n(H\u03b1)\ntypically a few knots (1-3), such as C1 in IRAS 06076-2139, C1 in IRAS 08572+3915 N,\nand C4 in IRAS 12112+0305.\n\n4.3\n\nMetallicities\n\nNumerical studies have claimed that during an interaction large amounts of gas flow\ntoward the central regions, carrying less enriched gas from the outskirts of the galaxy\ninto the central regions (Rupke et al. 2010; Montuori et al. 2010). Indications of this\nmixing process, which usually disrupts any metallicity gradient and dilutes the central\nmetallicity, have been observed in merging (U)LIRGs (Rupke et al. 2008), in galaxy pairs\n(Kewley et al. 2006; Ellison et al. 2008; Michel-Dansac et al. 2008), and in star-forming\ngalaxies at high-z (Cresci et al. 2010). As a consequence of the metal enrichment of the\n130\n\n\f5 - From H\u03b1 Complexes to TDG Candidates in (U)LIRGs\nexternal regions of the mergers, additional star formation can occur from reprocessed\nmaterial there. We investigated whether the interaction process affects the metallicity of\nour H\u03b1 complexes.\nThe adopted metallicities (see Chapter I, Section 3.5) for all the candidates are shown\nin the last column in Table IV.2. With values compatible to a solar metallicity, they\ngenerally range from 12 + logO/H = 8.5 to 8.8 (with the exception of two candidates\nwith lower abundances). The values for complexes observed with VIMOS have to be\nconsidered with care and must be checked with other metallicity indicators, since the\nN2 calibrator might be affected by ionization from strong shocks in the external regions\nof these galaxies (Monreal-Ibero et al. 2010). Moreover, spatially resolved studies of\nstar-forming regions indicate that the assumption of spherical geometry is unrealistic in\nmost cases, which has a direct impact on the derivation of metallicities. Ercolano et al.\n(2007) estimated the systematic errors in the metallicity determinations when assuming\nspherical geometry using different calibrations. In the worst-case scenario, the derived\noxygen abundances might be overestimated by 0.2-0.3 dex by the use of the calibrators\nconsidered in this study, in which case the derived metallicites for the H\u03b1 complexes\nwould then approach Z\u2299 /3.\nThe H\u03b1 complexes in this study do not follow the well-known metallicity-luminosity\nrelation for nearby isolated dwarf galaxies (see Fig. IV.4). Most galaxies also follow\nthis relation (Weilbacher et al. 2003). On the other hand, HII regions in compact\ngroups of galaxies and TDGs in general deviate significantly from the relation and have\na metallicity that is independent of their luminosity, an indication that all these objects\nconsist of recycled material.\n\n5\n\nFrom H\u03b1 Complexes to TDG Candidates in (U)LIRGs\n\nMost H\u03b1-emitting complexes have similar observational properties (i.e., H\u03b1 equivalent\nwidths and luminosities, MF 435W magnitudes, metallicities, radii) to the most luminous\nextragalactic giant HII regions in spirals and mergers, as well as more massive objects\nsuch as TDGs or TDG progenitors. Associations of young star-forming regions with a\nlarge HI reservoir have been found in TDGs, for instance by Duc et al. (2007). We\nmay then consider whether the H\u03b1-emitting complexes in our sample are dynamically\nunbound associations of objects with masses similar to observed Super Star Clusters\n(SSCs) or larger, more massive, and self-gravitating objects such as dwarf galaxies.\nTDGs are self-gravitating objects with masses and sizes typical of dwarf galaxies\n(i.e., a total mass of 107 -109 M\u2299 ), formed with recycled material from the parent\ngalaxies involved in an interaction/merger (Duc et al. 2000; see also General Introduction, Section 2.2). Hence, they are stable entities with their own established dynamical\nstructure. To evaluate whether our complexes constitute real TDGs or TDG progenitors and assess their chance of survival, we need to answer a few basic questions: Is the\n131\n\n\fChap. IV\n\nTDG Candidates in Low-z (U)LIRGs\n\ncomplex massive enough to be considered as a dwarf galaxy? Is it stable enough to be\nunaffected by its internal motion? Are the gravitational forces too strong to disrupt it?\nWe disscuss here these questions.\n\n5.1\n\nSelection of H\u03b1-emitting Likely to Represent TDG Candidates\n\nAlthough old TDGs have been observed (e.g., Duc et al. 2007), their identification is\nnot straightforward. When an old TDG is detected, the tail from its place of origin will\nprobably have completely disappeared and the TDG may be classified as another type\nof dwarf galaxy. A determination of the metallicity and, especially, the total mass of the\nobject is needed to establish its tidal origin and mass. With spectroscopic data, we are\nable to study (though with some limitations and biases) the metal content, the dynamical\nmass, and different methods to establish whether a given candidate can withstand both\ninternal and external forces. It is awkward to identify luminous enough condensations of\nold populations (i.e., very massive) and obtain kinematic information because the stellar\nabsorption lines that would have to be used often have too low a signal-to-noise ratio\n(S/N). Although TDGs containing only old populations may be present in our sample,\nwe are unable to detect them. Another way of searching for TDG candidates is based\non either analyzing the H\u03b1 emission clumps (for that we have a sufficiently high S/N)\nand/or combining spectral and photometric data of blue H\u03b1-emitting objects in interacting systems (e.g., Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u00edlchez 2001; Weilbacher et al. 2003; Temporin\net al. 2003; L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2004). Therefore, the selection of TDG candidates in\nour sample of (U)LIRGs is based on the detection of H\u03b1 emission clumps with stellar\ncounterparts, which is similar to our identification of H\u03b1 complexes.\nHowever, we are limited by the angular resolution of the spectral data. To make our\nestimates as accurate as possible, we do not consider in our discussion here complexes with\nmultiple luminous star-forming knots. Different types of motions within the components\nof a given complex can strongly affect the derivations mentioned before. The most\ncharacteristic examples of complicated complexes are C1 in IRAS F10038-3338 and C2\nin IRAS 12112+0305. This does not mean that the possibility of these complexes being\nTDGs is ruled out, just that we do not have enough resolution to study the kinematics\nof each knot, thus determine whether they are kinematically bound or not.\nWe consider only complexes with simple structures, that is, mainly where only one\nknot is detected. We also include complexes with several knots, one of which (normally\ncentered on the H\u03b1 peak emission) dominates the broad-band luminosity. The complex\nC1 in IRAS 04315-0840 would be a good example. On the basis of these criteria, the\nkinematic and dynamical properties of 22 complexes are derived and compared with those\nexpected for a TDG.\nIf we detect more than one knot within the selected complexes, we consider only the\nbroad-band luminosity of the brightest knot. In these cases, the H\u03b1 luminosity of the\n132\n\n\f5 - From H\u03b1 Complexes to TDG Candidates in (U)LIRGs\ncomplex is scaled in the same way as the F435W flux is scaled to the total F435W broadband flux of the complex in Table IV.1. In practice, we multiply the H\u03b1 luminosity by\na factor that in general is higher than 0.5 (a factor of 1 means that there is only one\nknot emitting the whole broad-band flux, thus responsible for the full H\u03b1 emission). The\nkinematic measurements, such as the velocity dispersion, are not performed for the whole\ncomplex, but only for the spaxels close to and located at the peak of the H\u03b1 emission.\nThis permits us to avoid any contamination by a faint knot in the border of the complex\n(e.g., faint knots within C1 in IRAS 04315-0840).\nUsing the kinematic information provided by the IFU data as well as the photometric\nmeasurements, we assess the origin and likelihood of survival of the 22 selected H\u03b1 complexes, and evaluate whether they can be the progenitors of Tidal Dwarf Galaxies.\n\n5.2\n\nAre They Massive Enough to Constitute a TDG?\n\n5.2.1\n\nAge and Mass Estimates of the Young Population\n\nThe H\u03b1 emission can be used to constrain the properties of any recent episodes of star\nformation. According to the starburst99 models (SB99 , Leitherer et al. 1999; V\u00e1zquez\n& Leitherer 2005), the detection of an H\u03b1 flux and EW larger than about 13 \u00c5\n(see Table IV.2 for specific values) implies that the stellar population is younger than 10\nMyr (see Fig. I.8 in Chapter I). With the broad-band luminosities of the brightest knot\nwithin the complex and the scaled H\u03b1 luminosity, we can estimate to first order the age\nand the mass of the young population of the selected complexes. We note that, owing\nto the distance of the systems (DL < 270 Mpc) and the shape of the HST filters, the\nH\u03b1 emission-line does not contaminate these broad-band filters. We have made use of\nthe synthetic stellar population model SB99, which is optimized for young population\nand also provides information on the ionized gas. The parameters used in the model\n(IMF , metallicity, etc.) are defined in Chapter I, Section 3.2.\nWe computed the mass-independent evolutionary track shown in Fig. IV.5 using information about the ratio of the flux of the modeled population in the broad-band filters\nto the flux of the ionized gas in the H\u03b1 line. Placing these ratios on a plot for all observed\ncomplexes, we now estimate the age of the young population. Once the age is known\n(hence a M/L ratio), the mass can be derived. However, before going any further and\nbased on the assumptions made, we first assess the sources of uncertainty that a priori\ncould affect our results:\n\u2022 The internal extinction is unknown. In general, the extinction in the inner regions\nis patchy with high peaks in (U)LIRGs, up to AV \u2243 8 mags (see Alonso-Herrero\net al. 2006 and Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn et al. 2009a), though it decreases considerably\nwith the galactocentric distance. Were complexes to have low extinction values\n133\n\n\fChap.

The broad-band filter fluxes have been multiplied by the band-width to obtain\nthe values with the same units as the H\u03b1 flux. Solid line shows the evolutionary track of the\nsame ratios for a single burst using SB99 models (see text). Dotted line shows the track for\na composite population where 99% of the mass corresponds to a 1Gyr population. The small\ntriangle almost at the beginning (zero-age young population) of the second track indicates that\nthe young population is 2Myr old and we add 1 Myr to the subsequent triangles. The typical\nuncertainty associated with the data is shown above the extinction vector, which is drawn at\nthe bottom right-hand corner.\n\n(AV . 1.5mag) their flux quotients would tend to follow the evolutionary\ntrack (solid line in Fig. IV.5), and the age would remain practically unchanged.\nOnly one complex probably has a higher internal extinction (C1 in IRAS\n14349-1447). A high extinction value of AV \u223c 3.5 mags was indeed measured\nfor this complex in Moneral-Ibero et al. (2007). The typical extinctions of the\nTDG candidates studied in Monreal-Ibero are between AV = 0.7 and 2 mag, which\nis consistent with the extinctions derived for our selected complexes (see Fig. IV.5).\n\u2022 The local background flux (from the underlying parent galaxy) assumed to be\nassociated with either older populations or non-H\u03b1 line-emitters, was subtracted\nwhen the photometry was performed for the knots. However, a knot itself can be\nformed by a composite of young and old population. If we were to assume that a\nsignificant fraction of the red and blue fluxes measured for the knots originated\n134\n\n\f5 - From H\u03b1 Complexes to TDG Candidates in (U)LIRGs\nfrom an older population, the evolutionary track would change (see the composite\npopulations in Fig. IV.5); the young population would then be even younger than\ninitially predicted and consequently less massive. Almost half of the complexes\nare incompatible with the composite track, since their flux ratios would be too\nsmall, even smaller than for a zero-age young population. The other complexes,\nfor which the values are compatible with the composite track, would typically have\na young population of about or younger than 4 Myr. Were this to be the case,\nthe extinction would be negligible and the equivalent widths would be about 200 \u00c5.\n\u2022 It can also happen that the measured H\u03b1 flux is emitted by possible embedded\n(and undetected) star-forming knots. The existence of undetected H\u03b1-emitters is\njustified with the H\u03b1-emitter in IRAS 08572+3915 N (clump on the North-West).\nWe estimated how many undetected knots there can be with an age derived from\nthe peak values of the EW (typically between 5 and 10 Myr, according to the\nstellar population models used in Section 5.2.1) that can contribute significantly to\nthe total broad-band luminosity of the knots. Since they would have a similar age,\nan embedded population of knots with a combined broad-band flux similar to that\nof the detected knots would emit half of the H\u03b1 flux. We then estimated how many\nknots at the detection limit would be needed to double either the F435W or the\nF814W flux. A total of 9 and 75 undetected knots per complex would be needed\nand we detected an average of 2.2 knots per complex. Thus, between 4 and 37 times\nmore knots fainter by 2.4-4.7 magnitudes would be needed only in one complex.\nAssuming a luminosity function with slope of 2 we would need practically one-third\nof the total knots predicted for the whole galaxy inside a complex, which is unlikely.\n\u2022 Had we included some H\u03b1 contribution from the neighboring zones then the H\u03b1 flux\nmeasured would have been overestimated. The H\u03b1 flux drops considerably as age\nincreases across the age interval we consider (by up to more than one order of\nmagnitude), but if the H\u03b1 flux is weaker the mass of the young population decreases\naccordingly. The mass estimated using the red filter can vary by up to a factor of\nfour within the age interval 1-10 Myr, according to the stellar population models\nused in this study. The age estimate would be older by no more than 1 Myr, if we\nhad overestimated the flux by a half. Thus, this correction would in our case be\nnegligible.\nTaking into account these sources of uncertainty, the first-order estimates of the age\nwere performed for the young population inside a complex, assuming a single burst. We\nestimated the age by considering the extinction value that we would need to shift the\nlocation of each dot (flux quotients) along the evolutionary tracks. The estimated ages\nrange from 2 to 5 Myr (Ageph ; see Table IV.3), the typical age range in which an instantaneous burst of star formation displays Wolf-Rayet features in its spectra (Leitherer\net al. 1999). Given the spectral range covered in this study, we would expect to see\n135\n\nWR\n\n\fChap. IV\n\nTDG Candidates in Low-z (U)LIRGs\n\nthe well-known red WR bump, which is the result of the blend of the [CIII] \u03bb5698 and\n[CIV] \u03bb5808 broad emission lines (Kunth & Schild 1986). We tried to find these features\nin the spectra of the complexes, but could find no clear evidence of these bumps. This\nbump is much more difficult to detect than the other bump (such as the blue bump) characteristic of WRs because it is always weaker (e.g., Fernandes et al. 2004; L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez\n& Esteban 2009). Sometimes it is not even detected again in Wolf-Rayet galaxies where\nit was previously seen (L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez & Esteban 2009). Therefore, the non-detection\nof WR features does not definitely exclude the hypothesis that the young population in\nour complexes spans the age range 2-5 Myr.\nAn upper limit to the age can be estimated by using the EW (H\u03b1), as it decreases\nstrongly with time. Using the EW peaks (see Table IV.2), we estimate that the age is in\nthe range 5-10 Myr (AgeEW ; see Table IV.3). In many cases, the EW peaks are not strong\nenough to explain population as young as our former age estimates. This is unsurprising\nbecause within a complex and a spaxel itself the underlying older population contributes\nsignificantly to the H\u03b1 continuum but not to the emission line. The contribution of this\ncontinuum minimizes the total EW within a complex. The broad-band flux of the knots\ntypically represents between 1% and 40% of the total flux within the area of the complex.\nWe consider for instance a 3 Myr-old population whose broad-band flux represents 10%\nof its overall broad-band flux within the complex. According to the models we use, the\nequivalent width of the young population without contamination would be \u223c1000 \u00c5.\nHowever, the contamination of a 1 Gyr-old population would diminish the equivalent\nwidth to a measured value of 70 \u00c5 for the whole complex, the same value as a single\npopulation of 6 Myr without contamination. Therefore, with the observed EW we can\nonly set an upper limit to the age in each case.\nAs a conservative approach, instead of directly using the youngest estimates to derive\nthe mass of the young population, we use the average of the two estimates, Ageph and\nAgeEW . Thus, once the age and extinction were estimated, the mass was directly obtained\nvia the extinction-corrected F814W magnitude.\nUnder these assumptions, the derived mass of the young population of the selected\nH\u03b1 complexes is between 104.5 M\u2299 and 105.5 M\u2299, with the exception of three complexes\nfor which the derived mass is about or close to 107 M\u2299 (M[I] ; Table IV.3). These\ncomplexes have extinctions of AV \u223c 1-2 mag, with the exception of C1 in IRAS 143481447 (AV = 4.2 mag). The uncertainty in this mass is typically smaller than a factor\nof two. This rather small uncertainty is expected, since during the first 1-7 Myr of\nthe starburst the broad-band luminosities do not change significantly. However, if we\ncompute the mass using the H\u03b1 luminosity (M[H\u03b1] ; Table IV.3) the uncertainties increase\nconsiderably. This is also expected because the H\u03b1 flux for a population of a given\nmass evolves significantly with the age of the starburst. The few cases in which both\nmeasurements are incompatible suggest that the age of the burst is closer to the youngest\nvalue (Ageph ). The corresponding M[H\u03b1] would be lower toward a value similar to M[I] .\nAn old population of a few Gyr (prior to the interaction, and in the parent galaxy) in\n136\n\n\f5 - From H\u03b1 Complexes to TDG Candidates in (U)LIRGs\n\n5\n\n42\nlog (LZH\u03b1(erg s-1))\n\nlog (reff (pc) )\n\n4\n\n43\ngiant HII\nelliptical\nelliptical+globular\n\n3\n2\n1\n\n40\n39\n\n0\n0.0\n\n41\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nlog (\u03c3 (km s-1) )\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n38\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\nlog (\u03c3 (km s-1) )\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\nFigure IV.6: Left: elocity dispersion vs. estimated effective radius.

We have seen previously that\nthe colors of some complexes can be compatible with a composite population where a\n1 Gyr-old population is 99% more massive than a young burst. Thus, we consider it\nworth investigating this possibility also here. Table IV.3 shows the estimates of the age\nof the young (AgeCyoung ) and the mass of both populations (MCyoung and MCold ). The\nstellar mass of the complexes generally ranges from 105.5 M\u2299 to 106.5 M\u2299 , an order of\nmagnitude higher than the previous estimates.\n\n5.2.2\n\nConditions for Self-gravitation\n\nMeasuring velocity gradients helps us assess whether there is either any independent\nrotation (Weilbacher et al. 2002; Bournaud et al. 2004; Bournaud et al. 2008b) or\n137\n\n\fTable IV.3: Derived characteristics of the stellar populations and dynamics of the identified star-forming complexes\n\nIRAS\n\nAV\n\nM[I]\n\nM[H\u03b1 ]\n\nAgeCyoung\n\nAV C\n\nMCold\n\nMCyoung\n\nMdyn\n\nMnear\ntid\n\nMCM\ntid\n\nnumber (Myr) (Myr)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\n(mags)\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(Myr)\n(8)\n\n(mags)\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\n(km s\u22121 )\n(15)\n\n(16) (17)\n\n2.1\n2.8\n2.9\n3.1\n3.2\n2.7\n3.0\n2.2\n1.5\n3.9\n2.4\n2.0\n\n0.2 \u00b1 0.4\n0.7 \u00b1 0.5\n0.0 \u00b1 0.0\n0.0 \u00b1 0.6\n0.6 \u00b1 0.5\n0.0 \u00b1 0.0\n0.0 \u00b1 0.6\n0.8 \u00b1 0.4\n2.5 \u00b1 0.3\n1.1 \u00b1 0.4\n0.4 \u00b1 0.4\n0.3 \u00b1 0.4\n\n5.8 \u00b1 0.1\n5.5 \u00b1 0.2\n5.6 \u00b1 0.1\n6.1 \u00b1 0.2\n6.5 \u00b1 0.2\n5.7 \u00b1 0.1\n6.0 \u00b1 0.2\n8.0 \u00b1 0.1\n8.5 \u00b1 0.1\n7.5 \u00b1 0.1\n5.7 \u00b1 0.1\n6.5 \u00b1 0.2\n\n3.8 \u00b1 0.1\n3.5 \u00b1 0.2\n3.6 \u00b1 0.1\n4.1 \u00b1 0.2\n4.5 \u00b1 0.2\n3.7 \u00b1 0.1\n4.0 \u00b1 0.2\n6.0 \u00b1 0.1\n6.5 \u00b1 0.1\n5.5 \u00b1 0.1\n3.7 \u00b1 0.1\n4.5 \u00b1 0.2\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n8.1\n> 10\n> 10\n> 10\n> 10\n> 10\n> 10\n> 10\n> 10\n> 10\n> 10\n0.7\n1.3\n> 10\n> 10\n> 10\n> 10\n\n224 8.6\n235 2.3\n96 0.2\n96 0.2\n92 0.2\n93 0.2\n97 0.2\n103 0.2\n180 7.5\n125 1.7\n233 1.2\n225 1.0\n207\n117 3.6\n113 26.2\n496 5.1\n275 1.0\n575 5.4\n214 1.7\n220 4.6\n175 1.5\n222 85.7\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n> 10\n0.9\n1.2\n\n302\n408\n519\n\n04315-0840\n\n1\n2\n06076-2139\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n07027-6011 S\n1\n2\n08572+3915 N 1\n08572+3915 SE 3\n4\nF10038-3338\n3\n4\n12112+0305\n1\n4\n14348-1447\n1\n15250+3609\n1\nF18093-5744 N 3\nF18093-5744 C 1\n23128-5919\n1\n\n16007+3743\n\nR1\nR2\nR3\n\n3.4\n4.0\n2.9\n3.0\n4.4\n3.0\n2.9\n2.8\n2.1\n3.2\n2.8\n4.9\n4.9\n3.6\n4.9\n3.4\n2.1\n3.3\n5.4\n2.9\n3.5\n3.3\n\n6.0\n10.0\n5.4\n6.0\n6.4\n6.5\n6.8\n7.0\n5.0\n5.2\n6.9\n5.2\n6.3\n5.5\n5.2\n7.2\n6.2\n6.3\n\n-\n\n7.1\n5.4\n6.4\n\n1.7\n1.5\n1.1\n1.0\n0.6\n0.8\n0.4\n1.0\n1.2\n0.6\n0.7\n0.9\n1.4\n0.7\n0.9\n2.2\n1.1\n4.2\n2.4\n1.9\n1.6\n1.8\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n1.7\n1.2\n2.3\n\n0.3\n0.4\n0.3\n0.4\n0.3\n0.4\n0.2\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.4\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n\n4.9\n4.2\n5.4\n4.9\n4.6\n4.5\n4.4\n5.2\n4.9\n4.5\n5.4\n5.1\n5.5\n4.4\n5.0\n7.1\n5.4\n7.7\n6.6\n5.0\n4.8\n5.7\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n8.8\n8.8\n7.8\n\n0.1\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.1\n0.2\n0.2\n0.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0.2\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.2\n\n5.4\n5.8\n5.9\n5.4\n5.1\n5.0\n5.1\n5.9\n5.6\n4.6\n5.9\n5.1\n6.1\n4.5\n5.2\n7.3\n6.1\n8.1\n6.7\n5.8\n5.2\n6.1\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n-\n\n0.3\n0.5\n0.2\n0.3\n0.2\n0.5\n0.4\n0.8\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n0.5\n0.3\n0.5\n\n7.5\n7.8\n8.0\n8.0\n7.9\n8.0\n7.6\n7.9\n8.7\n7.6\n8.2\n9.4\n9.3\n9.3\n7.9\n7.6\n9.0\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n0.3\n0.3\n0.5\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.4\n0.4\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.2\n\n9.8\n10\n10.1\n\n6.6\n6.0\n5.8\n5.7\n4.5\n4.5\n4.3\n5.0\n6.1\n5.6\n7.2\n6.6\n6.3\n5.8\n5.6\n9.2\n6.2\n9.1\n7.7\n4.1\n3.6\n7.1\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n8.2\n9.2\n10\n\n0.3\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.3\n0.3\n0.4\n0.4\n0.4\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n1.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.3\n0.2\n\n7.4\n6.6\n6.5\n9.6\n6.7\n9.2\n5.1\n5.6\n7.0\n\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n0.3\n\n8\n10.1\n9.1\n\nMdyn /Mtidal vesc\n\n7.4\n4.4\n1.5\n\nNotes.

However, given the spatial resolution achieved with the IFS instruments, we\ncannot in general resolve any velocity field across the extranuclear condensations. In this\ncase, other indirect methods must be used to assess whether the internal motions of our\ncomplexes can affect their stability.\nIglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u00edlchez (2001) established an empirical luminosity criterion\n(L(H\u03b1) > 1039 erg s\u22121 ) that must be reached by their HII complexes to ensure selfgravitation. This criterion, however, has not been supported by any kinematic study.\nMore than 50% of our own complexes fulfill this criterion, as shown in Table IV.2. If we\ncorrected for internal extinction, only three would be less luminous than 1039 erg s\u22121 .\nAnother method that can be used to establish whether the selected complexes are\nstable is to study their location in well-known empirical correlations followed by other\nself-gravitating entities such as elliptical galaxies, bulges of spiral galaxies, globular clusters, and/or giant HII regions: the radius-velocity dispersion and the luminosity-velocity\ndispersion relations (Terlevich & Melnick 1981). Here, we consider these relations because they provide more reliable constraints than the H\u03b1 luminosity of the complexes.\nWe plot these relations for our complexes in Fig. IV.6.\nIn the radius-velocity dispersion diagram, we superimpose the data of samples of\ndynamically hot systems such as massive globular clusters, dwarf elliptical and spheroidal\ngalaxies, intermediate and giant ellipticals, and TDG candidates. Within all of the\nuncertainties, the velocity dispersions of six of the complexes selected here are too high\nto ensure self-gravitation.\nFor a giant HII region, the lower envelope in the log LH\u03b1 - log\u03c3 plane is closely represented by a straight line of the form LH\u03b1 = c + \u0393 \u00d7 log\u03c3, where \u03c3 refers to the velocity\ndispersion, the constant c ranges from 34.5 to 36.8, and \u0393 is between 2 and 4 (see line fits\nand references in Fig. IV.6, right). This is known as the luminosity-velocity (L-\u03c3) dispersion relation, and implies that the giant extragalactic HII regions above the envelope\nare gravitationally bound complexes of stars and gas and that the widths of the nebular\nemission lines reflect the motions of discrete ionized gas clouds in the gravitational field\nof the underlying stellar and gaseous mass (Terlevich & Melnick 1981). The kinematics\nof the HII regions below the envelope may be dominated by processes other than gravitational motions, such as stellar winds and expanding shells (Rela\u00f1o et al. 2005; Rela\u00f1o &\nBeckman 2005; Rozas et al. 2006a; Rozas et al. 2006b). That is, if the relation for giant\nHII regions lies above the envolope, then the non-gravitational processes are identified\nwith broad, low-intensity components that do not considerably affect the physical properties of the main spectral component (i.e., gravitational motions). Thus, although the\nvelocity of these fenomena could be similar or even larger than the \u03c3 measured in this\npaper, if the relation for our complexes is above the envelope, the spectral component\ncorresponding to the gravitational motions will probably not be affected.\nIn any case, we estimated the expansion speeds of bubbles in the interstellar medium,\nso as to quantify how broad these non-gravitational components are. We evaluated the\n139\n\n\fChap. IV\n\nTDG Candidates in Low-z (U)LIRGs\n\nequivalent number of O3(V) stars using the H\u03b1 luminosity of a given complex and the\nvalue given by Vacca et al. (1996) for the ionizing photon output of an O3(V) star.\nWe then derived the kinetic energy input from the stellar winds, using the estimate by\nLeitherer (1998) of the wind luminosity for an O3(V) star, integrated over the time the\nstar is on the main sequence. Assuming a typical average electron density of 100 cm\u22123 ,\nobseved in (U)LIRGs (Veilleux et al. 1995, 1999), the expansion speeds are expected to\nbe (Lamers & Cassinelli 1999) between several km s\u22121 for the least luminous complexes\nand less than 30 km s\u22121 for the most luminous ones.\nGiven the metallicity range of our selected complexes, we applied a metallicity correction to the H\u03b1 luminosity, in such a way that \u2206log (F(H\u03b1)) = 127z - 1.17 (Terlevich\n& Melnick 1981), where z denotes the metallicity value (z=0.02 for solar metallicity).\nWithin the uncertainties, all the selected complexes but two are consistent with the line\nfits or above the envelope (Fig. IV.6, right). Interestingly, these two outlying complexes\nare consistent with the radius-velocity dispersion correlation. Although the values for\nanother complex are below the envelope, we note that its H\u03b1 luminosity was not corrected because its metallicity is unknown. Thus, no complex fails both criteria at the\nsame time. According to these results, self-gravitation should be ensured for more than a\nhalf of the complexes for which a determination of the velocity dispersion was achieved.\nFor the remainder, self-gravitation is neither guaranteed nor excluded because at least\nthey generally satisfy one of the two criteria used.\n\n5.2.3\n\nDynamical Mass Estimates\n\nUpper limits to the dynamical masses (Mdyn ) of the selected complexes were derived under the following assumptions: (i) the systems are spherically symmetric;\n(ii) they are gravitationally bound; and (iii) they have isotropic velocity distributions\n2\n[\u03c3 2 (total) = 3\u00d7\u03c3LOS\n], where \u03c3LOS is the line-of-sight velocity dispersion. In the previous section, we have seen that more than a half of these complexes are likely to be\ngravitationally bound.\nThe equations to obtain the dynamical mass of a virialized stellar (cluster- or galaxylike) system are presented in Chapter I, Section 3.6.2. The observables needed to derived\nit are the effective radius and the velocity dispersion. Since the star-forming knots have\na cluster-like light profile (similar to a Gaussian) the use of Equation I.5 to derive the\ndynamics of the selected complexes seems appropriate. The corresponding masses, given\nin Table IV.3, are between a few 107 and a few 109 M\u2299 , with an uncertainty of a factor\nof 2-3.\n140\n\n\f5 - From H\u03b1 Complexes to TDG Candidates in (U)LIRGs\n5.2.4\n\nTotal Mass: Discrepancy Between the Stellar and the Dynamical\nMasses\n\nIt is unclear where to draw the line between a high-mass young super cluster and a lowmass dwarf galaxy in terms of stellar mass. We derive masses only for young population,\nand those complexes less massive than 106 M\u2299 are comparable to the brightest young\nclusters or complexes hosting recent star formation in other less luminous interacting\ngalaxies (e.g., Mengel et al. 2008; Bastian et al. 2009). However, does the estimated\nmass of the young stellar population represent the total mass of the candidates? Only a\nfew studies have reported stellar masses for TDGs. The dynamical mass of our complexes\nis in the range of the typical total baryonic mass of a TDG (M = 107 -109 M\u2299 ; e.g., Duc\net al. 2004; Higdon et al. 2006; Hancock et al. 2009). However, the ratio of the\ndynamical to the most massive photometric mass in our complexes is suspiciously high\n(Mdyn /m[MI ] \u223c 50-1000). Several factors can explain this ratio.\nIf we assume that the stellar mass represents the total mass of a given complex, this\nmass might be underestimated, because:\n\u2022 Although the most recent bursts of stars are responsible for the bulk of the\nionization of the gas - hence of the emitted flux- the kinematics of the ionizing\ngas is affected by those of previous stellar generations. In regions of mixed\npopulations, the light is generally dominated by the young stars and the mass\nby the older population. As outlined before, Sheen et al. (2009) derived a total\nstellar mass of 3.1\u00d7107 M\u2299 for one of their TDG candidates, a fraction of no more\nthan 2% being contained in populations younger than 6 Myr. The mass-to-light\n(M/L) ratio of young (e.g., 5 Myr) and old (e.g., 1 Gyr) populations differs by\nabout a factor of 100. The H\u03b1 to the broad-band luminosity colors of some of our\ncandidates are also consistent with those of composite populations. Our complexes\nmight indeed consist of young star-forming knots and evolved population from\nthe complexes themselves and the parent galaxy that has been accreted by the\ncomplex. We estimated the total stellar mass of the complex if practically all the\nF814W flux measured inside the whole complex (minus the flux from the knots)\nbelonged to it and came from a 1 Gyr-old population. This total stellar mass\napproaches significantly to the dynamical mass measured for most of the complexes.\n\u2022 The total stellar population does not normally represent the total baryonic mass\n(gas + stellar), and we do not have access to the mass of the gas. Normally,\nthe efficiency of star formation in molecular clouds is very low (typically about\n1%). In (U)LIRGs the efficiency can be higher, but the mass of a molecular cloud\nundergoing a starburst episode may still be higher than the mass of the starburst\nby more than one order of magnitude. The candidates in Hancock et al. (2009)\nhave total stellar masses of 1-7\u00d7106 M\u2299 , the HI mass being 6\u00d7107 M\u2299 . Studies\nbased on radio HI observations have found that the gas mass of a TDG with a\n141\n\n\fChap. IV\n\nTDG Candidates in Low-z (U)LIRGs\n\ntypical diameter of a few kpcs lies within the range between a few 107 and several\n109 M\u2299 (e.g., Duc et al. 2000; Bournaud et al. 2004; Duc et al. 2007).\n\nOn the other hand, if we assume that the dynamical mass represents the total mass\nof a given complex, we might be overestimating it, because:\n\n\u2022 In each case, Mdyn represents normally an upper limit to the dynamical mass.\nFor instance, given the complex dynamics in interacting systems, high velocity\ndispersions might not necessarily indicate high masses, but might alternatively\nrepresent tidal-flows induced from the merging process and strong winds from\nLINER-like regions (Colina et al. 2005; Monreal-Ibero et al. 2010). However,\nat least for the systems that we previously observed with VIMOS, these strong\nwinds may not affect significantly the determination of the velocity dispersions\n(Monreal-Ibero et al. 2010).\n\n\u2022 Dark matter might contribute significantly to the total TDG mass. However,\nTDGs are unlikely to contain a large amount of dark matter (Barnes & Hernquist 1992b) because their material is drawn from the spiral disk, while the dark\nmatter is thought to surround the galaxy in an extended halo.\n\nOn the basis of all these arguments, it is clear that the total masses of these complexes\nis somewhere between the photometric and the dynamical masses. Other independent\ncriteria also show that more than a half of the selected complexes are in virial equilibrium, thus the velocity dispersion traces more likely the dynamical mass rather than\nother processes (see Section 5.2.2). Given all the caveats and uncertainties previously\nconsidered when determining the dynamical and stellar masses, we assume as a mass\ncriterion that the complexes with photometric mass estimates using the broad-band luminosities (single or composite population) that are compatible with 106 M\u2299 are likely\nto have a sufficient total mass to become a tidal dwarf galaxy. This assumption should\nobviously be verified using multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic data. Only\nsix of the selected complexes (plus the three candidates in IRAS 16007+3743) fulfill this\nmass criterion. Had we assumed that a complex with a dynamical mass compatible\nwith 108 M\u2299 or higher has sufficient mass to become a TDG, then 15 of the selected\ncomplexes would fulfill the mass criterion.\n142\n\n\f5 - From H\u03b1 Complexes to TDG Candidates in (U)LIRGs\n5.3\n5.3.1\n\nAre They Unaffected by the Forces from the Parent Galaxy?\nTidal Forces\n\nIf the complex is massive enough to constitute a dwarf galaxy and gravitationally\nbound, its fate basically depends on the ratio of its mass to the so-called tidal mass\n(Binney & Tremaine 1987; Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2001). The tidal mass condition\nwill tell us whether it is massive enough to survive the tidal forces exerted by the parent\ngalaxy. The tidal mass is defined as\n\nMtid\n\n\u0012 \u00133\nR\n= 3M \u00d7\nD\n\n(IV.1)\n\nwhere M refers to the mass of the parent galaxy, R is the radius of the complex (here\nthe size of the most luminous knot in a complex), and D is the distance to the parent\ngalaxy. This equation is valid when the size (R) of a certain region is small in comparison\nwith the distance (D) to the parent galaxy, which is the case for all of the complexes\n(the ratio \"size/projected distance\" is typically below 0.04). If the tidal mass of an object\nis lower than the total mass, then the object is unaffected by the forces applied by the\nparent galaxy.\nIn general, the gravitational potential of interacting galaxies, as in ULIRGs , is a\ncomplex function of the mass distribution of the system, which evolves with time. Nevertheless, as a first approximation, we assumed that the distribution is dominated by the\nmasses of the main bodies of the system. Two different approaches were applied in this\nstudy: the gravitational potential depends either on: i) the nearest galaxy (Mnear\ntid ) or ii)\na point mass in the mass center and the total mass of the system (MCM\n).\nThe\nhighest\ntid\nvalue obtained using the different approaches was taken to compare with the dynamical\nmass of the complex.\nIn each case, we used the measured projected distances dnear and dCM , respectively\n(see Table IV.1). Since the projected distance is always smaller than the real one, we\nactually estimated upper limits to the real tidal masses. To derive the tidal mass, we\nneed to know the mass of the parent galaxy, which in each case is identified with its\ndynamical mass. Under the same hypothesis as in Section 5.2.3 of a virialized system,\nthe dynamical mass of a galaxy-like object can be obtained using Equation I.4 (Chapter I, Section 3.6.2), but assuming this time a constant value of m = 1.75 (a scaling factor\nfor a polytropic sphere), like in Colina et al. (2005). In each case, we used the average\nvalue of the velocity dispersion at the peak and nearby surrounding spaxels, covering\nabout a radius of 1\u2032\u2032 . Finally, the effective radii of the parent galaxies were derived using\nthe H -band NICMOS and WFC3 images of the galaxies and fitting their two-dimensional\nlight profiles with GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002; Peng et al. 2010). In many cases, the\n143\n\n\fChap. IV\n\nTDG Candidates in Low-z (U)LIRGs\n\nNICMOS images do not cover the full extent of the galaxies, which meant that we had\nto use the values given in Arribas et al. (in prep.).\nIn summary, two values (Mnear\nand MCM\ntid\ntid ) for the tidal mass were obtained using Equation IV.1, and the maximum value was compared to the dynamical mass of\nthe selected complexes derived in Section 5.2.3. The ratio Mdyn /Mtid is in general > 10\n(see Table IV.3), which ensures that the complexes are unaffected by the tidal forces\nexerted by the parent galaxy. Only one complex fails this condition and another one is\nclose to failing because of large uncertainties in its dynamical mass estimate.\n5.3.2\n\nEscape Velocity\n\nIf the complex does not have a large enough relative velocity (vrel ) with respect to the\ngalaxy to escape, it might still fall back towards the center of the system because of the\ngravitational force exerted by the parent galaxy. It is interesting to consider whether a\ncomplex does indeed exceed the effective escape velocity (vesc ). This criterion, however,\nshould not have the same weight as the others since it is subject to many uncertainties:\n(i) the real distance of the complex is always larger than the projected one; (ii) only one\ncomponent of the velocity is measured and there is no information about the movements\nin the plane of the sky; and (iii) two possibilities for the relative movements between the\nregion and the system are always possible, since for a given configuration it is impossible\nto determine whether the complex is closer or further away from the observer than the\nmass center. We include this criterion in this study for completeness.\nFor simplicity, we assume that the gravitational potential is created by a point mass\nrepresenting the total mass of the system, that is located at the mass center. The ratio\n|vesc |/vrel (last column in Table IV.3) is smaller than 1 for 7 of the selected complexes out\nof the 22, that is, they could escape. If we take into account projection effects statistically,\na complex escapes if |vrel | \u2212 |vesc \u00d7 cos(\u03c0/4)| > 0. In this case, an additional complex\nsatisfies the criterion.\n5.4\n5.4.1\n\nHow Common is TDG Formation in (U)LIRGs?\nTDG Candidates in (U)LIRGs\n\nNone of the developed criteria can help us determine wheter a given complex will survive the merging process. Projection effects and observational constraints, especially the\nneed for higher angular resolution spectroscopic data (which would allow us to search for\nvelocity gradients), ensure that it is difficult to assess the fate of the selected complexes.\nIn any case, we can investigate which have the higher probabilities of surviving as a TDG,\nbased on the fulfillment of a few or most of the criteria viewed in this study. The results\nare summarized in Table IV.4.\n144\n\n\f5 - From H\u03b1 Complexes to TDG Candidates in (U)LIRGs\nTable IV.4: Summary of the different criteria used to investigate the nature of the\ncomplexes\n\nIRAS\n04315-0840\n06076-2139\n\n07027-6011 S\n08572+3915 N\n08572+3915 SE\nF10038-3338\n12112+0305\n14348-1447\n15250+3609\nF18093-5744 N\nF18093-5744 C\n23128-5919\n16007+3743\n\nComplex Mass L (H\u03b1) \u03c3 vs. reff \u03c3 vs. LH\u03b1 Mtid vs. Mdyn vesc vs. vrel\nnumber\n\nProb\n\n1\n2\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1\n2\n1\n3\n4\n3\n4\n1\n4\n1\n1\n3\n2\n1\n\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\n?\nN\nN\nN\n?\nY\nN\nY\nY\n?\nY\nY\nN\nN\nY\n\nY\nN\nY\nY\nN\nN\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\nY\nN\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\n?\nN\n?\nY\n?\n?\nY\nY\nN\n?\nY\nN\nN\nY\nN\n\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nN\nY\n?\nY\n?\nY\n?\n?\n?\nN\nY\n?\nY\nY\nY\nY\n?\n\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\n?\nY\n?\nY\nY\n?\nY\nY\nN\n?\nY\nY\nY\nY\nN\n\nN\nN\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nN\nY\nN\nY\n?\nN\nN\nN\nY\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\n\nMedium\nLow\nMedium-high\nMedium-high\nMedium\nMedium\nMedium-high\nLow\nMedium\nLow\nMedium\nLow\nLow\nMedium\nMedium-high\nMedium\nLow\nHigh\nMedium-high\nMedium\nMedium\nLow\n\nR1\nR2\nR3\n\nY\nY\nY\n\nY\nY\nY\n\nY\nY\nY\n\nY\nY\nY\n\nY\nN\nY\n\nN\nN\nN\n\nHigh\nHigh-medium\nHigh\n\nNotes. The different criteria are explained throughout the text. The letter Y indicates that the given\ncomplex satisfies the criterion, while the letter N indicates that it fails. Symbols with a question mark\nare either doubtful or indicate that we do not have the data to study the criterion. The last column\nindicates the probability that a given complex constitutes a TDG candidate based on these criteria.\n\nWe assigned different weights to the diverse criteria we studied and derived a probability that a certain complex could survive as a TDG by adding the weights for the criteria\nthat it achieves. The mass criterion is considered to be the most important since, even if\nit is self-gravitating, if it does not have enough mass the complex could be either a bound\nsuper cluster or any other entity rather than a low-mass dwarf galaxy. For this reason,\nit is assigned a weight of 30%. The criteria with the least importance (each having a\nweight of 10%) correspond to the H\u03b1 luminosity and the escape velocity ones, since the\nformer comes from empirical considerations and the latter is the least reliable of all. We\nassigned a weight of 20% to the Mtid versus (vs.) Mdyn criterion. Finally, we considered\na somewhat lower weight (15%) for each of the self-gravitating criterion (\u03c3 vs. reff and\n\u03c3 vs. LH\u03b1 ), since they prove the same condition. In practice, the complexes that satisfy\nmost of the criteria have the highest probabilities of being TDG progenitors.\nOnce the percentage was computed based on which criteria the complexes fulfill, different probabilities that a complex constitutes a TDGs were defined: low (prob \u2264 40%),\nmedium (40 < prob \u2264 60), medium-high (60 < prob \u2264 80), and high (prob > 80). Only\nthree complexes (counting IRAS 16007+3743 have a high probability. A total of 6 of the\n145\n\n\fChap. IV\n\nTDG Candidates in Low-z (U)LIRGs\n\n22 selected complexes (9 of 25 if we include those from IRAS 16007+3743) have mediumhigh or high probabilities of being TDG progenitors, and from now on we consider these\nas our TDG candidates.\nWe detect candidates in both LIRGs and ULIRGs , although the three candidates\nwith a high probability are only found in LIRGs . This suggests that TDG production may be more efficient in systems with higher infrared luminosities. However,\nthis statistic is of very limited robustness because of the low number of candidates\nfound. If we consider only systems for which IFS data are available and located at\na distance (i.e., DL > 130 Mpc) where at least a galactocentric radius of 10-15 kpc is\ncovered with the spectroscopic data, we obtain a production rate of about 0.3 candidates per system for the (U)LIRG class. Other TDGs have been observed at larger\ndistances (d > 30 kpc; Sheen et al. 2009; Hancock et al. 2009) not covered by the\nFoV of our IFS data. The detection of bright and blue knots (i.e., MF 814W > -12.5\nand MF 435W -MF 814W < 0.5) in the tidal tails and their tips in the ACS images of some\n(U)LIRGs (regions not covered with the IFS data; see Fig. II.3 in Chapter II), indicative\nof a young population more massive than 105 M\u2299, may increase the number of candidates\nfor the (U)LIRG class.\n\n5.4.2\n\nDynamical Evolution of the TDG Candidates\n\nThe number of candidates in systems undergoing the early phases of the interaction\nprocess (i.e., phases I-II and II) is 7, significantly larger than the 2 detected in more\nevolved systems. Normalized to the total number of systems in early and advanced\nphases, we obtain 0.5 and 0.13 candidates per system, respectively. Therefore, TDGs are\nmore likely to be formed during the first phases of the interaction in (U)LIRGs .\nTo analyze the meaning of this trend we need to consider both the life expectancy\nof these candidates as well as their detectability during their lifetime. Our result does\nnot mean that the total number of candidates in each phase decreases at all. Although\nlarge HI reservoirs have been found in a few TDGs (Duc et al. 2007) that would be able\nof sustaining star formation on a Gyr scale, it is unknown whether these are common.\nOur candidates are indeed H\u03b1-selected. We might have been unable to identify candidate objects as old as 20 Myr and older, for which their H\u03b1 emission is undetectable.\nThere is a score of knots in the initial sample of 32 galaxies at a projected galactocentric distance larger than 2.5 kpc, with colors (MF 435W -MF 814W > 1.5) and luminosities\n(MF 814W < -15), such that if the population were about 100-1000 Myr old the stellar\nmass would be higher than 107 -108 M\u2299 , close to or similar to the total stellar mass of\nobserved TDG candidates.\nBournaud & Duc (2006) ivestigated a set of 96 N-body simulations of colliding galaxies\nwith various mass ratios and encounter geometries, including gas dynamics and star\nformation. They investigated the dynamical evolution of the TDG candidates found in\n146\n\n\f5 - From H\u03b1 Complexes to TDG Candidates in (U)LIRGs\nthe various simulations up to t = 2 Gyr after the first pericenter of the relative orbit of\nthe two galaxies. On the basis of the comparison with a higher resolution simulation of\na major merger by Bournaud et al. (2008b), we can roughly assign different dynamical\ntimes after the first pericenter for the different phases of interaction defined in this thesis.\nIn this way, the first phases of the interaction (I-II and III) are likely to occurr during\nthe first 400 Myr of the interaction process. If we consider only the observed candidates\nin (U)LIRGs during these early phases and these systems for which we have available\nIFS data that cover at least 10-15 kpc of galactocentric radius we derive a production\nrate of about 0.6 candidates per system. Although the simulations of Bournaud & Duc\n(2006) continue up to t = 2 Gyr, they fit the number of their TDG candidates versus\ntime with an exponential decay and a lifetime of 2.5 Gyr. They estimate the number\nof candidates that survive (long-lived candidates that neither fall back nor lose a large\nfraction of their mass) after 10 Gyr corresponds to 20% of the TDG candidates formed\nduring the early phases of the interaction (i.e., t < 500 Myr after the first pericenter).\nAccording to this percentage, we estimate a production rate of about 0.1 (20% of 0.6)\nlong-lived TDG candidates per system for the (U)LIRG class.\nThe average production rate of 0.1 long-lived TDGs per system can either become\nlower or higher depending on follow-up studies with IFS capable of providing higher\nspatial resolution (i.e., adaptive optics assisted systems) and covering a FoV that will\neven allow us to study galactocentric distances greater than 30 kpc. Modeling and\nobservations claim that the most prominent TDGs are found along the tidal tails and\nin particular at their tips (e.g Hibbard & Mihos 1995; Duc & Mirabel 1998; Weilbacher\net al. 2000; Higdon et al. 2006; Duc et al. 2007; Bournaud et al. 2008b; Hancock et al.\n2009). Thus, it would be unsurprising that when covering the whole field of the local\n(U)LIRG systems with IFS facilities, more TDG candidates will be found. Moreover,\nkinematic data of higher spatial resolution would allow us to determine more reliably\nwhether the candidates are bound.\n\n5.4.3\n\nImplications for TDG Formation at High-z\n\nAfter estimating the production rate of long-lived TDG candidates per system for\nthe (U)LIRG class, we can now roughly estimate whether satellites of tidal origin are\ncommon, and more specifically, the contribution of TDGs in the early Universe to the\ndwarf population we see in the local universe. Local (U)LIRGs represent an appropriate\nclass of objects to study the importance of TDGs at high redshift because: (i) they are\nmajor contributors to the star formation rate density at z \u223c 1-2 (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al.\n2005); and (ii) ULIRGs resemble the sub-millimeter galaxies detected at higher redshifts\nin the sense that they are merging systems with extremely high rates of star formation\n(Chapman et al. 2003; Frayer et al. 2003; Engel et al. 2010).\nOkazaki & Taniguchi (2000) studied a scenario in which galaxy interactions and/or\nmerger events act as the dominant formation mechanism of dwarf galaxies in any environ147\n\n\fChap. IV\n\nTDG Candidates in Low-z (U)LIRGs\n\nment and these interactions occur in the context of the hierarchical structure formation\nin the Universe. They claimed that all dwarfs in the Universe might have a tidal origin.\nOn the basis of this scenario, their statement assumed a production rate of 1 to 2 tidal\ndwarfs per merger, which has a lifetime of at least 10 Gyr. The production rate we\nestimate for long-lived candidates in (U)LIRGs is a factor of 10-20 lower, such that their\ncontribution to the overall dwarf population is only 10-5%. Therefore, we do not find\nstrong evidence that all the local dwarf galaxy population have a tidal origin. This result\nis consistent with recent estimates implying that the contribution of TDGs to the overall\ndwarf population is insignificant (Bournaud & Duc 2006; Wen et al. 2011; Kaviraj et al.\n2011).\nThe study by Okazaki & Taniguchi (2000) covers a wide range of mass ratios for\nthe interacting systems. In our sample, the systems with more than one nucleus span\nmass ratios from 1:1.7 to 1:3.6, which is the most favorable range for long-lived TDGs,\naccording to the simulations of Bournaud & Duc (2006). Were high-z interactions to\nhave similar mass ratios, the production rate estimated by Okazaki & Taniguchi would\nbe higher than the predicted 1-2 tidal dwarf per merger. Thus, our production rate would\nbe a factor of more than 10-20 higher, and the contribution of TDGs to the overall dwarf\npopulation would become even lower than 10-5%. Rodighiero et al. (2011) claimed that\nmergers at z \u223c 2 have a very low contribution (\u223c 10%) to the cosmic star formation rate\ndensity. Were this result to be confirmed, the contribution of TDGs to the overall dwarf\npopulation would still be lower, to a negligible value.\n\n6\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nIn this Chapter, we have combined high angular resolution HST images with spectroscopic data from IFS facilities to characterize H\u03b1-emitting clumps in an initial sample of\n27 (U)LIRGs. Our study has extended the search of TDG candidates by Monreal-Ibero\net al. (Monreal-Ibero et al. 2007) by considering both LIRG systems and additional and\nmore sensitive images. In particular, we have detected a total of 31 extranuclear starforming complexes in 11 (U)LIRGs and characterized the main physical and kinematic\nproperties of these complexes. Using structural, physical, and kinematic information, we\nhave also estimated the stellar and dynamical mass content of the complexes and studied\ntheir likelihood of resisting the effects of internal as well as external forces based on different dynamical tracers. With all these parameters, we have identified which complexes\nhave the highest probabilities of being long-lived TDG candidates in (U)LIRGs. We draw\nthe following conclusions:\n1. Located at an average projected distance of 9.3 kpc from the nucleus, within the\nrange 3.3-13.4 kpc, the structures of the complexes are generally simple, consisting\nof one or a few compact star-forming regions (knots) in the HST images, though a\nfew of them reside in a richer cluster environment. The complexes have typical B\n148\n\n\f6 - Summary and Conclusions\nluminosities (MF 435W < -10.65), sizes (from few hundreds of pc to about 2 kpc),\nand B - I colors (MF 435W -MF 814W . 1.0) that are similar to those observed in\ngiant HII regions and dwarf-like objects. The relatively high metallicities derived,\nof normally Z\u2299 -Z\u2299 /3 (independent on the luminosity of the complex), reflect the\nmixing of the metal content in interacting environments, as observed in a few\nextragalactic HII regions and TDG candidates.\n2. The measured H\u03b1 luminosities of the complexes are comparable to those of extremely luminous H\u03b1 complexes in nearby systems, giant extragalactic HII regions,\nTDG candidates, and normal dwarfs. Their sizes seem to be more related to the\nnature of the system. In our case, many complexes have sizes typical of dwarf-like\nobjects.\n3. Twenty-two complexes with very simple structures were selected to study their\nnature as TDGs. The stellar masses derived for these complexes using the H\u03b1 and\nbroad-band luminosities and equivalent widths of a single burst or a composite\npopulation (young burst + 1 Gyr) range from a few 104 to 108 M\u2299 . Nevertheless,\nit is typically below 106.5 M\u2299 , which is the lower limit to the total mass. In\ncontrast, the complexes have dynamical masses that are a factor of 50-1000 higher,\nwhich provides an upper limit to the total mass.\n4. A total of 9 complexes, namely TDG candidates, have the highest probabilities\nof becoming dwarf galaxies, at least up to 1-2 Gyr. They are probably massive\nenough and satisfy most of our criteria for self-gravitation (i.e., the position in the\nradius-\u03c3 and the luminosity-\u03c3 planes) and resistance to the forces from the parent\ngalaxy. We have found evidence that their formation takes place more often in\nearly phases of the interaction.\n5. When we consider only systems for which the IFS data cover a significant fraction\nof the whole system, the production rate of candidates averages about 0.3 per\nsystem. This rate is expected to decrease to 0.1 for a long-lived 10 Gyr dwarf,\naccording to recent galaxy merger simulations. Were this to be the case, fewer\nthan 5-10% of the general dwarf satellite population could be of tidal origin.\n\n149\n\n\f\fGeneral Conclusions & Perspectives\nOverview\nThis Chapter gives a general overview of this thesis. We summarize the most relevant conclusions achieved throughout this\nstudy and propose new perspectives that this work opens. The\nmost interesting lines of research upon the work carried out in\nthis thesis, together with the possibilities that telescopes and\nfacilities available currently and in the near future will offer,\nare also outlined.\n\nThis thesis work has explored the physical and dynamical properties of opticallyselected compact stellar regions in low-z galaxies with extreme episodes of star formation,\nLuminous and Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies. The cornerstone of this project is the\nuse of high angular resolution HST imaging of a representative sample of (U)LIRGs.\nTo that end, archival data from the optical cameras ACS and WFPC2 were retrieved.\nFor the first time, this kind of analysis has been carried out in an extensive (32) sample\nof these systems, covering the entire infrared luminosity range and morphological types\n(indicative of different phases in the dynamical evolution of the interaction process they\nare undergoing). These data were combined with optical integral field spectroscopic (IFS)\ndata obtained with INTEGRAL and VIMOS spectrographs, mounted on the William\nHerschel Telescope and on the VLT, respectively. Finally, with the use of a dataset\nfrom a numerical simulation of a galaxy encounter, we have also been able to investigate\nthe dynamical evolution of the properties of the compact stellar regions all along the\ninteraction process. This thesis covers three main aspects:\n- With a sample of 32 representative (U)LIRGs we are able to detect close to 3000\ncompact star-forming regions (knots), more than one order of magnitude higher than\nin previous studies in these kind of sytems. The present work thus takes a step\nforward in charaterizing their properties. We study the dependence of the physical\nproperties of the knots (e.g., luminosities, colors, sizes, etc.) on different parameters\nsuch as the infrared luminosity of the system (i.e., a proxy of its global star formation\n151\n\n\fGeneral Conclusions & Perspectives\nrate) or the interaction phase (i.e., dynamical evolution). Given the importance of\n(U)LIRGs at z \u223c 1-2, we also evaluate the resemblance of these knots with clumpy\nstructures observed at intermediate and high redshifts.\n- We also performed a direct comparison with the predicted properties of compact\nstar-forming regions in a high spatial resolution simulation of a galaxy encounter.\nSince simulated and observed systems cover different phases of the interaction with\nsimilar spatial resolutions (30-100 pc), the sample used in this thesis is appropriate\nfor such comparison. This study allows us to test the predictions of the simulations\non real data and interpret empirical results obtained with the observations of (U)LIRGs.\n- The search for potential long-lived tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG ) candidates in local\n(U)LIRGs is the last issue we investigate in this thesis. We characterize the extranuclear\nH\u03b1-emitting complexes and, with the derived properties (metallicity, H\u03b1 luminosity,\ndynamical mass, etc.), we select and evaluate the likelihood of survival of those complexes likely to represent long-lived TDGs. This study is relevant to understand the\nformation of primordial dwarf galaxies at high-z and their contribution to the overall\ndwarf population.\nThe most relevant results of this thesis are the following:\n\u2022 The knots in (U)LIRGs span a wide range in observed luminosities\n(-20 . MF 814W . -9 and -19.5 . MF 435W . -7.5). They are in general more\nluminous than observed star-forming regions in less luminous interacting systems\nsuch as the Antennae or M51. In fact, distance effects considered, knots in\nULIRGs are intrinsically a factor of 4 more luminous than in LIRGs . Size-ofsample effects are likely to be the natural explanations, since the star formation\nrate in ULIRGs is higher than in less luminous systems.\n\u2022 The knots are in general compact, with a median effective radius of 32 pc, 12%\nbeing unresolved and a few very extended, up to 200-400 pc. Most of them are\nlikely to contain sub-structure and therefore to constitute complexes or aggregates\nof star clusters. In fact, we find a clear correlation between the knot mass and\ntotal radius, M\u221dR2 , similar to that found for complexes of star clusters in less\nluminous interacting galaxies (e.g., M51 and the Antennae) and Galactic and\nextragalactic giant molecular clouds.\n\u2022 Even though (U)LIRGs are known to have most of their star formation hidden\nby dust, a fraction of 15% of the optically-selected knots in these systems are\nextremely blue (MF 435W -MF 814W < 0.5) and luminous (<MF 435W > -11.5). This\n152\n\n\fclearly indicates the presence of a young stellar population (i.e., between a few to\nabout few tens of Myr), almost free of extinction and with masses (104 -107 M\u2299 )\nsimilar to and up to one order of magnitude higher than the Young Massive\nClusters detected in other less luminous interacting systems.\n\u2022 Knots in ULIRGs can have both sizes and masses characteristic of stellar complexes\nor clumps detected in clumpy galaxies at high redshifts (z & 1), as long as their\npopulation is a few dozens of Myr or older. Thus, there is evidence that the\nlarger-scale star formation structures are reminiscent of those seen during the\nepoch of mass assembly and galaxy formation.\n\u2022 The optically-selected knots span a wide range in color (MF 435W -MF 814W = [-1,5]).\nIn contrast, the color distribution of the simulated knots in simulations of major\nmergers span a narrower range (MF 435W -MF 814W = [0.5,2]). Agreement between\nthe reddish tail (i.e., MF 435W -MF 814W > 1) of the observed and simulated colors is\nobtained if an exponential probability density function of median value AV =1.1-1.4\nmag (typical obscuration in the range AV =[0,5] mag) is applied to the simulated\ncolors. On the other hand, in order to explain the bluish part of the broadening of\nthe color distribution (bluish tail, MF 435W -MF 814W < 0 \u2212 1), the combination of\ntwo effects must be taken into account: (1) the age uncertainty in the simulation,\nwhich affects significantly the color estimation of the youngest population; (2) the\nfact that (U)LIRGs constitute systems with high SFRs (very young population,\ni.e., blue colors) at all interaction phases, whereas in the simulation the SFR is\nonly enhanced in the pre-merger phase.\n\u2022 The star formation in (U)LIRGs is characterized by B - and I -band luminosity\nfunctions (LF ) with slopes close to 2, extending therefore the universality of the LF measured in interacting galaxies at least for nearby systems\n(i.e., DL < 100 Mpc), regardless of the bolometric luminosity of the systems (i.e.,\nthe strength of the global star formation). There are, however, slight indications\nthat the LF evolves with the interaction phase, becoming steeper (from about\n1.5 to 2 for the I -band) from early to late phases of interaction. A high linear\nresolution simulation of a major merger shows some evidence for the variation\nof the slope of the LF with the interaction, which is likely due to higher knot\nformation rates during the early phases of the interaction with respect to late\nphases. However, there is no evidence that this variation is correlated with the\nglobal star formation rate of the system. The same origin could explain the\nslight variation of the LF of the knots in (U)LIRGs provided that the global\nstar formation is concentrated in few knots during intermediate and advanced\ninteraction phases.\n\n153\n\n\fGeneral Conclusions & Perspectives\n\u2022 We find theoretical and observational evidence that only the most massive\nstructures remain after the interaction process is completed, although it is still\nnot clear how they form: (i) as individual massive entities; (ii) or after a merging\nprocess of clusters into superclusters.\n\u2022 A total of 31 luminous extranuclear star-forming H\u03b1 clumps have been identified\nin 11 (U)LIRGs. These clumps, associated to stellar complexes, are usually located\nalong the tidal tails of the systems and do show in general simple structure (i.e., one\nor a few knots on the HST images). They have integrated properties (luminosities,\ncolors and sizes) similar to those observed in giant HII regions and dwarf-like\nobjects, and a relatively high metallicities (Z\u2299 -Z\u2299 /3), which reflects the mixing of\nthe metal content in interacting environments. The measured H\u03b1 luminosities of\nthe complexes are comparable with extremely luminous H\u03b1 complexes in nearby\nsystems, giant extragalactic HII regions, TDG candidates and normal dwarfs.\n\u2022 Twenty-two of the complexes with very simple structures were selected to study\ntheir nature as TDG. Applying several different criteria related to the luminosity,\nmass and empirical evidence that suggests self-gravitation and stability against\nforces from the parent galaxy, only 9 complexes, namely TDG candidates, have the\nhighest probabilities to survive as dwarfs. If we consider only systems for which\nthe IFS covers a high fraction of its optical extent we obtain a rate production of\nabout 0.1 of long-lived TDG candidates per (U)LIRG system. This result suggests\nthat only a small fraction (< 10 %, and compatible with a negligible fraction) of\nthe general dwarf satellite population could be of tidal origin.\nAll this information has helped us draw a global picture of the unobscured or mildy\nobscured star formation and evolution of compact structures in systems with extreme\nstar formation. Although some properties of these optically-selected star-forming regions\ncan be similar to those in less luminous interacting environment (e.g., presence of young\npopulation in the optical despite the high extinction measured in the innermost regions\nof some systems, luminosity functions, presence of TDG candidates), others reflect the\npeculiarities of (U)LIRG systems. The identification of intrinsically more luminous populations in systems with higher luminosity, the presence of young populations (i.e., blue\ncolors) throughout all the phases of interaction, the evidence that clusters may merge\nin superclusters efficiently, and the similarity (in terms of mass and size) of the knots\nto observed structures in high-z clumpy galaxies, show that the extreme environment in\n(U)LIRGs have some effect on the the star formation and evolution at local scales.\nHowever, this study has to be seen as a starting point, since there is a lot to be done\nin order to obtain a deeper understanding of all the peculiarities of the star formation\nand evolution of compact structures in (U)LIRGs. First, it is of paramount importance\nto observe these structures at other wavelengths to break the degeneracy between the\n154\n\n\fextinction and the age of the stellar population, as well as to characterize knots with\nmultiple stellar populations and to have a detailed knowledge of the star formation history\nof the systems. For instance, Lee et al. (2005) show how photometric observations in\nthe U -band breaks the degeneracy in young reddened clusters in M51. Information from\nhigh resolution near-infrared (NIR) photometry which covers the complete FoV of the\nsystems is also important so as to make reliable estimations of the mass of the compact\nstellar structures. With the use of WFC3 on board the HST, we can now deal with these\nchallenges, since this imager covers the UV, visible and near-infrared bands at resolutions\nsimilar to the optical images used in this study.\nSimulations of major mergers are catching up observations of nearby systems in terms\nof spatial resolution. The development of these numerical tools that let us understand\nthe environment of interacting galaxies is nowadays growing up very rapidly. Specifically,\nnew hydrodynamic simulations of major mergers by Teyssier et al. (2010), which achieve\nspatial resolutions up to 12 pc and implement gas cooling below \u223c104 K, resolve properly\nthe process of gas fragmentation into massive clouds and rapid star formation. The\nmodel used in this thesis has some issues (i.e., gas fragmentation) at small galactocentric\ndistances (i.e., d < 5 kpc) that the new set of models are able to sort out, and with higher\nspatial resolution. A large number of compact stellar objects extending to lower masses\ncan be identified, thus the comparison with the knots in our systems can be improved\nsignificantly.\nThe formation, evolution and survival of tidal dwarf galaxies is subject to intense\ndebate. In order to farther investigate the existence and true nature of the candidates\nwe first need to observe in H\u03b1 the full extent of the systems, sampling the tidal tails and\nespecially the tips. With a FoV larger than the ACS camera and the possibility to tune\nthe narrow-band H\u03b1 filter throughout the redshift range our sample spans, the OSIRIS\nimager, currently operating on the Gran Telescopio de Canarias, is the ideal instrument\nto perform this task. In the near-infrared we can also find tracers of recent star formation\n(i.e., Br\u03b3, at \u223c 2.17 \u03bcm). Thus, once the interesting H\u03b1-emitting complexes are selected,\ntheir kinematic and dynamical properties can be explored with IFS observations taken\nwith the Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observations in the Near Infrared, mounted on\nthe Very Large Telescope. The use of adaptive optics would allow us to achieve an\nangular resolution of \u223c 0.1\u2032\u2032 . Since the Br\u03b3 line is relatively weak, with a flux about 100\ntimes weaker than that of H\u03b1 (Osterbrock 1989), only the most luminous candidates (i.e.,\nthose with LH\u03b1 & a few \u00d71039 erg s\u22121 for the typical distance of the local LIRGs sampled\nand LH\u03b1 & a few \u00d71040 erg s\u22121 for ULIRGs ) would be observed. A similar study but\nusing the Pa\u03b1 line (at 1.87 \u03bc and less than a factor 10 fainter than the H\u03b1 line) can be\ndone for less luminous candidates. However, it is not possible to observe this line from\nthe ground and we will have to wait until the James Web Space Telescope is launched.\nThe integral field unit mounted on NIRSpec (a NIR spectrograph) will be able to perform\nsuch task. Once the spectroscopic data retrieved, the velocity fields of the candidates\nwould also be resolved and a more detailed study than that presented in this thesis could\nbe performed.\n155\n\nGTC\n\nSINFONI\nVLT\n\nJWST\n\n\fGeneral Conclusions & Perspectives\n\nALMA\n\nELT\n\nInformation at (sub-)millimetric wavelengths also represents a valuable tool to\ncharacterize the structure of the cold molecular gas in (U)LIRGs .\nWith the\nAtacama larger millimeter/submillimeter array, planned to be commissioned for observers at the end of 2011, we will be able to reach sub-arcsecond resolution while covering\na relatively large FoV. With this interferometer, the field of search and characterization\nof TDGs in (U)LIRGs will be surely revolutionized. Furthermore, the knowledge of the\nproperties of a molecular cloud in (U)LIRGs will provide the necessary information to\nestimate the star formation efficiency within the cloud, as done in Bastian et al. (2005a)\nfor the nearby M51 by computing an offset between mass-radius relation of GMCs and\ncomplexes of star clusters.\nObviously, higher spatial resolution is always needed to observe substructure (i.e.,\nindividual clusters instead of knots in our case). In fact, (U)LIRGs are yet to be placed in\nthe clustered star formation framework since most of them lie farther away than 100 Mpc\nand at these distances individual star clusters cannot be distinguished (normally apparent\nassociations are detected). Future large telescopes, as the extremely large telescope, with\nextremely improved adaptative optics will allow the observation on pc or even sub-pc\nscales at the distances where our local (U)LIRGs are. Then, individual clusters will be\nobserved and some results obtained in this thesis will be tested (e.g., the universality of\nthe slope of the luminosity function, if clusters in ULIRGs are intrinsically more luminous\nthan in less luminous systems, etc.). However, we may still have to wait for long and of\ncourse new questions will arise ...\n\n156\n\n\fConclusiones y Perspectivas de Futuro\nResumen\nEste Cap\u00edtulo trata de dar una visi\u00f3n general del trabajo de\ntesis. Se resumen las conclusiones m\u00e1s importantes de dicho\nestudio. Asmismo, se exponen las l\u00edneas de investigaci\u00f3n que\npodr\u00edan resultar m\u00e1s interesantes en base en lo realizado en esta\ntesis, junto con las posibilidades que ofrecen los telescopios y\nlas instalaciones operativas actualmente y en el futuro pr\u00f3ximo.\n\nEn esta tesis se han explorado las propiedades f\u00edsicas y din\u00e1micas de regiones estelares\ncompactas seleccionadas en el visible en galaxias a bajo z con episodios extremos de formaci\u00f3n estelar, las Galaxias Luminosas y Ultraluminosas en el Infrarrojo, (U)LIRGs (por\nsus siglas en ingl\u00e9s). La piedra angular de este proyecto radica en el uso de im\u00e1genes de\nalta resoluci\u00f3n angular tomadas con el HST de una muestra representativa de (U)LIRGs.\nPara ello se han empleado im\u00e1genes de archivo tomadas con las c\u00e1maras \u00f3pticas ACS y\nWFPC2. Es la primera vez que este tipo de estudio se ha completado para una muestra\nextensa (32) de estos sistemas. La muestra cubre por completo el rango de luminosidades\nen el infrarrojo y diferentes morfolog\u00edas, que representan diferentes fases en la evoluci\u00f3n\ndin\u00e1mica del proceso de interacci\u00f3n que se est\u00e1 llevando a cabo. Los datos fotom\u00e9tricos se\nhan combinado con datos de espectroscop\u00eda de campo integral (IFS, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s), tomados con los espectr\u00f3grafos INTEGRAL y VIMOS, instalados en los telescopios\nWilliam Herschel y VLT, respectivamente. Por \u00faltimo, hemos sido capaces de investigar\nla evoluci\u00f3n din\u00e1mica de las propiedades de las regiones compactas estelares durante el\nproceso de interacci\u00f3n gracias a los datos obtenidos en una simulaci\u00f3n num\u00e9rica de una\ncolisi\u00f3n de dos galaxias. Los tres objetivos fundamentales que se desarrollan en esta tesis\nson:\n- Hemos sido capaces de detectar cerca de 3000 regiones de formaci\u00f3n estelar compacta\n(nodos) en una muestra representativa de 32 (U)LIRGs, m\u00e1s de un orden de magnitud\nque en estudios previos llevados a cabo con muestras de estos sistemas. Se ha estudiado la dependencia de las propiedades f\u00edsicas de los nodos (luminosidades, colores,\n157\n\n\fConclusiones y Perspectivas de Futuro\ntama\u00f1os, etc.) con diferentes par\u00e1metros tales como la luminosidad en el infrarrojo\n(indicador de la tasa de formaci\u00f3n estelar global) o la fase de interacci\u00f3n (evoluci\u00f3n\ndin\u00e1mica). Puesto que la presencia de los sistemas (U)LIRGs es importante a z \u223c 1-2,\ntambi\u00e9n se ha valorado la semejanza de estos nodos con estructuras aglutinadas que\nse han observado a desplazamientos al rojo moderados y altos.\n- Asimismo, se ha llevado a cabo una comparaci\u00f3n directa con las propiedades de\nregiones compactas de formaci\u00f3n estelar que se predicen en una simulaci\u00f3n de\nuna interaci\u00f3n de galaxias de alta resoluci\u00f3n espacial. Dado que las observaciones\ny las simulaciones abarcan las diferentes fases de interacci\u00f3n y las resoluciones\nespaciales son similares (30-100 pc), la muestra observacional que utilizamos en\nestas tesis es adecuada para este tipo de comparaciones. Este estudio nos permite\ncomprobar las predicciones de las simulaci\u00f3n con datos reales e interpretar los resultados emp\u00edricos que se han obtenido con las observaciones de los sistemas (U)LIRGs.\n- La b\u00fasqueda de cadidatos a galaxias enanas de marea (TDG, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s) en\n(U)LIRGs locales constituye el \u00faltimo punto a tratar en esta tesis. Se han caracterizado\npropiedades tales como la metalicidad, luminosidad en H\u03b1, masa din\u00e1mica, etc., de los\ncomplejos de emisi\u00f3n de H\u03b1 extra-nucleares. Con ello se han seleccionado y evaluado\nla probabilidad de supervivencia de aquellos complejos propensos a constituir TDGs de\nlarga duraci\u00f3n. Este estudio es relevante para entender la formaci\u00f3n de las galaxias\nenanas primigenias a alto z y la contribuci\u00f3n de enanas de marea en el conjunto de la\npoblaci\u00f3n de galaxias enanas.\nLos resultados m\u00e1s notables que se han obtenido en esta tesis son los siguientes:\n\u2022 Los nodos detectados en la muestra de (U)LIRGs abarcan un amplio rango de\nluminosidades observadas (-20 . MF 814W . -9 y -19.5 . MF 435W . -7.5). En\ngeneral, son m\u00e1s luminosos que las regiones de formaci\u00f3n estelar que se han\nobservado en sistemas con menor luminosidad en el infrarrojo, tales como en La\nAntenna o M51. De hecho, y teniendo en cuenta efectos de distancia, los nodos en\nULIRGs son intr\u00ednsicamente cuatro veces m\u00e1s luminosos que los nodos en LIRGs .\nEfectos debidos al \"tama\u00f1o de la muestra\" suponen la explicaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s l\u00f3gica, ya que\nla tasa de formaci\u00f3n estelar en ULIRGs es mayor que en sistemas menos luminosos.\n\u2022 Los nodos son compactos, siendo 32 pc el valor mediano del radio efectivo. El\ntama\u00f1o de un 12% de los nodos no se puede resolver, mientras que unos pocos\nse extienden considerablemente, hasta los 200-400 pc. Es muy probable que la\nmayor\u00eda de ellos contengan subescructura y, por tanto, constituyan complejos o\nagregados de c\u00famulos estelares. De hecho, existe una clara correlaci\u00f3n entre la\n158\n\n\fmass de los nodos y su radio total, M\u221dR2 , parecida a la que se ha observado para\ncomplejos de c\u00famulos estelares en galaxias en interacci\u00f3n con menor luminosidad\n(por ejemplo, en M51 o en La Antena) y para nubes moleculares gigantes gal\u00e1cticas\ny extragal\u00e1cticas.\n\u2022 Pese a que se sabe que la mayor parte de la formaci\u00f3n estelar se encuentra\nescondida por el polvo en los sistemas (U)LIRGs , aproximadamente un 15%\nde los nodos \u2013que se han detectado en el visible\u2013 muestran unos colores azules\nextremos (MF 435W -MF 814W < 0.5) y son muy luminosos (<MF 435W > = -11.5).\nEstas propiedades indican claramente la presencia de poblaci\u00f3n estelar joven\n(entre unos pocos Myr y unas pocas decenas de Myr) y con muy poca extinci\u00f3n.\nCon unas masas entre 104 y 107 M\u2299 , estos nodos de poblaci\u00f3n estelar joven son\ntan masivos (y en algunos casos hasta un orden de magnitud m\u00e1s masivos) como\nlos superc\u00famulos j\u00f3venes masivos que se han observado en galaxias en interacci\u00f3n\nmenos luminosas.\n\u2022 El tama\u00f1o y las masas t\u00edpicas de los nodos de formaci\u00f3n estelar en ULIRGs y en\nestructuras aglutinadas que se han detectado en galaxias a alto redshift (z & 1)\nson muy similares, siempre que dicha poblaci\u00f3n en ULIRGs sea mayor a unas\npocas decenas de Myr. Por lo tanto, se han encontrado evidencias de que la\nformaci\u00f3n de estructuras a alta escala siempre ha sido muy semejante (tanto en el\nUniverso Local como en \u00e9pocas tempranas).\n\u2022 Los nodos abarcan un amplio rango de colores (MF 435W -MF 814W = [-1,5]). Sin\nembargo, la distribuci\u00f3n de los colores de los nodos en las simulaciones de interacciones mayores se extiende en un rago muy estrecho (MF 435W -MF 814W = [0.5,2]).\nSe puede lograr un acuerdo entre la parte roja (i.e., MF 435W -MF 814W > 1) de la\ndistribuci\u00f3n de colores de los nodos simulados y observados si se le aplica una\nextinci\u00f3n a los colores simulados, tal que siga una funci\u00f3n con una densidad\nde probabilidad exponencial con un valor mediano AV =1.1-1.4 mag (recorre un\nextincci\u00f3n t\u00edpica entre 0 y 5 mag). Por otro lado, se puede explicar el ensanchamiento de la parte azul (cola azul, MF 435W -MF 814W < 0 \u2212 1) de la distribuci\u00f3n\nde colores de los nodos observados mediante la combinaci\u00f3n de dos efectos: (1)\nla incertidumbre en edad en la simulaci\u00f3n, lo cual afecta considerablemente la\nestimaci\u00f3n del color de la poblaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s joven; (2) el hecho de que los sistemas\n(U)LIRGs tengan tasas de formaci\u00f3n estelar tan grandes (poblaci\u00f3n muy joven\no, lo que es lo mismo, colores azules), mientras que en la simulaci\u00f3n la tasa de\nformaci\u00f3n estelar s\u00f3lo aumenta significativamente la fase pre-fusi\u00f3n.\n\u2022 La formaci\u00f3n estelar en (U)LIRGs se caracteriza por una funci\u00f3n de luminosidad\n(LF), obtenida en bandas B e I, con una pendiente pr\u00f3xima a 2. Este resultado\n159\n\n\fConclusiones y Perspectivas de Futuro\nextiende la universalidad de la LF en sistemas en interacci\u00f3n con independencia de\nla luminosidad bolom\u00e9trica de los sistemas (es decir, la intensidad de la formaci\u00f3n\nestelar global), almenos para sistemas cercanos (DL < 100 Mpc). No obstante, se\nha encontrado una ligera evidencia de que la funci\u00f3n de luminosidad evoluciona\ncon la fase de interacci\u00f3n, de tal modo que durante el paso de fases tempranas a\nfases tard\u00edas de la interacci\u00f3n la pendiente se vuelve m\u00e1s pronunciada (de 1.5 a\n2 para el caso de la banda I ). El an\u00e1lisis de una simulaci\u00f3n de una interacci\u00f3n\nmayor de galaxias arroja un resultado similar. Seg\u00fan la simulaci\u00f3n, ello es debido\na que la tasa de formaci\u00f3n de nodos con respecto al total de la poblaci\u00f3n es mayor\nen fases tempranas con relaci\u00f3n a fases tard\u00edas de la interacci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, no\nhay evidencias claras de que este comportamiento de la pendiente est\u00e9 relacionado\ncon la tasa de formaci\u00f3n global del sistema. Este mismo origen podr\u00eda explicar\nla variaci\u00f3n de la pendiente de la LF de los nodos observados en los sistemas\n(U)LIRGs. Para ello la formaci\u00f3n estelar global se deber\u00eda concentrar en pocos\nnodos durante las fases intermedias y avanzadas de la interacci\u00f3n.\n\u2022 Se encuentran evidencias te\u00f3ricas y observacionales de que \u00fanicamente las estructuras m\u00e1s masivas sobreviven cuando el proceso de interacci\u00f3n se ha completado,\naunque todav\u00eda no est\u00e1 claro c\u00f3mo se forman: (i) entidades masivas individuales;\n(ii) o tras un proceso de interacci\u00f3n y fusi\u00f3n de c\u00famulos en superc\u00famulos.\n\u2022 Se han identificado 31 regiones de formaci\u00f3n estelar, emisores en H\u03b1 y extranucleares en un total de 11 (U)LIRGs. Se pueden asociar complejos de formaci\u00f3n\nestelar a dichas regiones, las cuales se detectan generalmente a lo largo de las colas\nde marea de los sistemas y cuya estructura es normalmente bastante simple (uno o\ndos nodos en las im\u00e1genes del HST ). Las propiedades integradas (luminosidades,\ncolores y tama\u00f1os) de estas regiones/complejos son semejantes a las que se han\nobtenido en regiones HII gigantes y objetos tipo galaxia enana. Asimismo, su\nmetalicidad es relativamente alta (Z\u2299 -Z\u2299 /3), lo cual refleja la mezcla de metales\nen interacciones. Las luminosidades en H\u03b1 de estas regiones son comparables con las de complejos extremadamente luminosos en sistemas cercanos, las de\nregiones HII gigantes extragal\u00e1cicas, candidatos a TDG y galaxias enanas normales.\n\u2022 Se ha realizado un estudio acerca de la naturaleza de 22 complejos con una estructura muy simple, como posibles candidatos a galaxias enanas de marea. Tras\naplicar varios criterios relacionados con la luminosidad, masa y evidencia emp\u00edrica\nque sugiere autogravitaci\u00f3n y estabilidad frente a las fuerzas de la galaxia progenitora, 9 complejos se han identificado como candidatos a TDG. La probabilidad\nde que estos candidatos sobrevivan como galaxias enanas son mayores que el resto\nde complejos. Si nos basamos en aquellos sistemas cuyo campo de visi\u00f3n de los\ndatos de espectroscop\u00eda integral cubre casi \u00edntegramente, la tasa de producci\u00f3n de\n160\n\n\fcandidatos a TDG por sistema se situa alrededor de 0.1. Este resultado sugiere que\n\u00fanicamente una peque\u00f1a fracci\u00f3n (< 10 %, e incluso despreciable) de la poblaci\u00f3n\nde galaxias enanas sat\u00e9lite se puede haber formado como una TDG.\nToda esta informaci\u00f3n nos ha ayudado a obtener una idea global de la formaci\u00f3n estelar y evoluci\u00f3n de estructuras compactas poco oscurecidas o sin extinci\u00f3n en sistemas con\nformaci\u00f3n estelar extrema. Algunas de las propiedades de estas regiones de formaci\u00f3n\nestelar son muy parecidas a las que se observan en interacciones con menor luminosidad:\nla presencia de poblaci\u00f3n joven en el visible a pesar de las altas extinciones que se miden en las zonas internas de algunos sistemas, las funciones de luminosidad, la presencia\nde candidatos a TDG, etc. Sin embargo, otras propiedades reflejan las peculiaridades\nde los sistemas (U)LIRGs , tales como: la identificaci\u00f3n de una poblaci\u00f3n intr\u00ednsecamente m\u00e1s luminosa en galaxias con mayor luminosidad en el infrarrojo, la presencia\nde poblaci\u00f3n joven (colores azules) durante todas las fases de interaci\u00f3n, la evidencia\nde que los c\u00famulos puedan interaccionar entre ellos de un modo eficiente y fusionarse\nformando superc\u00famulos, y la semejanza (en t\u00e9rminos de masa y tama\u00f1o) entre los nodos\nen (U)LIRGs y las estructuras que se han observado galaxias de formaci\u00f3n estelar a alto\nz. Estas peculiaridades demuestran que el entorno extremo en (U)LIRGs se plasma de\nalg\u00fan modo en la formaci\u00f3n y evoluci\u00f3n estelar a escala local.\nNo obstante, este trabajo se tiene que considerar como un punto de partida para\nlograr entender en profundidad todas las peculiaridades de la formaci\u00f3n y evoluci\u00f3n\nestelar de estructuras compactas en (U)LIRGs, pues todav\u00eda queda mucho por hacer. En\nprimer lugar, es imprescindible llevar a cabo observaciones de dichas estructuras en otras\nlongitudes de onda, para as\u00ed ser capaces de romper la degeneraci\u00f3n entre la extinci\u00f3n y\nla edad de la poblaci\u00f3n estelar. Estas observaciones tambi\u00e9n nos permitir\u00edan caracterizar\npoblaciones estelares m\u00faltiples en los nodos y obtener un conocimiento m\u00e1s detallado de\nla historia de formaci\u00f3n estelar de los sistemas. A modo de ejemplo, Lee et al. (2005)\ndemuestra que con observaciones en la banda U es capaz de romper la degeneraci\u00f3n de\nc\u00famulos j\u00f3venes oscurecidos en la galaxia M51. Asimismo, la fotometr\u00eda de im\u00e1genes de\nalta resoluci\u00f3n en el infrarrojo cercano (NIR, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s) que abarquen toda\nla extensi\u00f3n de los sistemas es necesaria a la hora de realizar estimaciones fidedignas\nde la masa de structuras estelares compactas. Hoy en d\u00eda, todos estos retos se pueden\nllevar a cabo con la c\u00e1mara WFC3, a bordo del HST . Con una resoluci\u00f3n similar a las\nim\u00e1genes utilizadas en esta tesis, la c\u00e1mara WFC3 cubre los rango ultravioleta, visible\ny NIR.\nLas resoluciones espaciales que alcanzan las simulaciones de interacciones mayores de\ngalaxias se acercan cada vez m\u00e1s a las resoluciones de las observaciones. El desarrollo\nde estas herramientas num\u00e9ricas, que son de gran utilidad para entender el entorno de\ninteracciones de galaxias, sigue un ritmo fren\u00e9tico. En concreto, las nuevas simulaciones\nhidrodin\u00e1micas desarrolladas por Teyssier et al. (2010) ya alcanzan resoluciones espaciales alrededor de los 12 pc y, a su vez, implementan el enfriamento del gas por debajo\nde \u223c104 K. Estas nuevas simulaciones resuelven de un modo m\u00e1s fehaciente el proceso\n161\n\n\fConclusiones y Perspectivas de Futuro\nde fragmentaci\u00f3n del gas en nubes masivas y subsiguiente formaci\u00f3n estelar r\u00e1pida. El\nmodelo num\u00e9rico que se ha utilizado en esta tesis tiene problemas para resolver correctamente la fragmentaci\u00f3n del gas a distancias galactoc\u00e9ntricas peque\u00f1as (d < 5 kpc). El\nnuevo set de modelos es capaz de solventar estos problemas, y a la vez, alcanzar mayor\nresoluci\u00f3n espacial. Con ello se podr\u00e1n identificar un n\u00famero mayor de objetos estelares\ncompactos y con mayor resoluci\u00f3n en masa. Por lo tanto, se podr\u00e1 mejorar el estudio\ncomparativo con los nodos estelares observados en (U)LIRGs.\nEn la actualidad persiste un debate muy intenso en torno a la formaci\u00f3n, evoluci\u00f3n y\nsupervivencia de galaxias enanas de marea. Es imprescindible realizar observaciones que\nsean capaces de cubrir la extensi\u00f3n completa de los sistemas en interacci\u00f3n a la hora de\ninvestigar m\u00e1s en detalle la existencia y naturaleza real de candidatos. De este modo, se\npodr\u00e1n muestrear las colas de marea y, en especial, los extremos. Con un campo de visi\u00f3n\nmayor al de la c\u00e1mara ACS y la posibilidad de sintonizar el filtro de banda estrecha H\u03b1 a\nlo largo de los diferentes desplazamientos al rojo que la muestra de esta tesis recorre, la\nc\u00e1mara OSIRIS, operativa en el Gran Telescopio de Canarias, supone el instrumento ideal\npara realizar tal tarea. En el infrarrjo cercano tambi\u00e9n podemos encontrar trazadores\nde formaci\u00f3n estelar reciente, tales como la l\u00ednea de recombinaci\u00f3n Br\u03b3, a \u223c 2.17 \u03bcm.\nAs\u00ed pues, una vez se seleccionen los complejos emisores en H\u03b1 de inter\u00e9s utilizando\nOSIRIS, se pueden ivestigar sus propiedades cinem\u00e1ticas y din\u00e1micas con observaciones\nde espectroscop\u00eda de campo integral con SINFONI, que se encuentra instalado en el VLT.\nCon el uso de t\u00e9cnicas de \u00f3ptica adaptativa se pueden alacanzar resoluciones angulares\ndel orden de 0.1\u2032\u2032 . Debido a que la l\u00ednea de emisi\u00f3n Br\u03b3 es relativamente d\u00e9bil en\ncomparaci\u00f3n con H\u03b1 (aproximadamente 100 m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil; Osterbrock 1989), \u00fanicamente\nse podr\u00e1n detectar las candidatas m\u00e1s luminosas con: LH\u03b1 & pocos \u00d71039 erg s\u22121 a las\ndistancias t\u00edpicas de las LIRGs locales muestreadas; y LH\u03b1 & pocos \u00d71040 erg s\u22121 a las\ndistancias t\u00edpicas de las ULIRGs locales muestreadas. Se puede realizar un estudio similar\npara candidatas menos luminosas utilizando la l\u00ednea de emisi\u00f3n Pa\u03b1 (a 1.87 \u03bc y menos\nde un factor 10 m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil que H\u03b1). Sin embargo, esta l\u00ednea no se puede observar desde\ntierra y tendremos que esperar hasta el lanzamiento del telescopio espacial James Web\n(JWST). Dicha tarea se podr\u00e1 realizar con la unidad integral instalada en el espectr\u00f3grafo\nen el infrarrojo cercano NIRSpec. Una vez se tengan los datos espectrosc\u00f3picos, se podr\u00e1\nresolver el campo de velocidades de las candidatas y se podr\u00e1 realizar un estudio m\u00e1s\ndetallado que el que se presenta en esta tesis.\nObservaciones en longitudes de onda (sub-)milim\u00e9tricas permiten caracterizar la estructura del gas molecular fr\u00edo en (U)LIRGs.

Seguramente este instrumento supondr\u00e1 un avance revolucionario en\nla investigaci\u00f3n en la b\u00fasqueda y caracterizaci\u00f3n de TDGs en (U)LIRGs. Asimismo, el\nconocimiento de las propiedades de las nubes moleculares en (U)LIRGs proporcionar\u00e1 la\ninformaci\u00f3n necesaria para estimar la eficiencia de la formaci\u00f3n estelar, como en Bastian\net al.

De hecho, todav\u00eda no se sabe\nqu\u00e9 lugar ocupan los sistemas (U)LIRGs en el marco de formaci\u00f3n estelar de c\u00famulos,\nya que la mayor\u00eda de estos sistemas se encuentran a distancias m\u00e1s lejanas a 100 Mpc.\nHoy en d\u00eda, a estas distancias no se pueden distinguir c\u00famulos indiviuales, sino que m\u00e1s\nbien lo que se suele detectar es agrupaciones aparentes de c\u00famulos. Con telescopios de\ngran tama\u00f1o, tales como el ELT, que posean un sistema de \u00f3ptica adaptativa considerablemente mejorada, se podr\u00e1n llevar a cabo observaciones a escalas del pc (e incluso\npor debajo) de sistemas que se encuentren a la misma distancia que las (U)LIRGs de\neste estudio. En tal caso, se podr\u00e1n observar c\u00famulos individuales y algunos de los resultados que se han obtenido en este trabajo de tesis (la universalidad de la pendiente de\nla funci\u00f3n de luminosidad, si los c\u00famulos en ULIRGs son intr\u00ednsicamente m\u00e1s luminosos\nque en sistemas con menor luminosidad, etc. ) se pondr\u00e1n a prueba. No obstante, puede\nque tengamos que esperar todav\u00eda largo tiempo y nuevas preguntas surgir\u00e1n ...\n\n163\n\n\f\fAppendix\n\nA\n\nCompleteness Tests\nOverview\nThis Appendix describes the technique used to estimate the\nincompleteness of our photometric data.\n\nWe have run a series of artificial star tests in order to assess the completeness and\nmeasurement quality of the photometric data set. Some considerations were taken before\napplying the tests:\n- Since each galaxy has a different local background level we had to run a test per\nHST image. The same happens if we consider different filters.\n- In the central regions of the galaxies the local background level is higher and steeper\nthan in the outer regions. Hence, different completeness levels are expected as the\ngalactocentric distance increases. To that end we defined two surface brightness\nregions based on the median value across the system: the inner region, corresponding\nto high surface brightness levels, and the outer region, corresponding to low surface\nbrightness levels. Using this approach, we ran completeness tests separately for each\nregion and afterwards we weighted each computed value by the number of knots\nwithin each region. Some works have used more varying levels of background (e.g., 7\nin Whitmore et al. 1999, 3 in Haas et al. 2008), but given the angular size of most of\nthe systems in this study it is not worth defining such number of levels in this study.\n- We have also taken into account the size of the knots, since most of them are actually slightly resolved. To include this effect we also ran two tests separately. First,\nwe added artificial stars with a PSF computed using foreground stars. Additionally, we artificially broadened that PSF by convolving it with a Gaussian that gives a\nFWHM \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 FWHM of the initial PSF. We have then taken the average value of\nthe completeness limit in each case.\n165\n\n\fAppendix A\n\nCompleteness Tests\n\n\u2206mF814W\n\nC Fraction\n\nPSF star, inner\n\nC Fraction\n\nConvolved PSF, inner\n\nConvolved PSF, outer\n\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n20\n\n\u2206mF435W\n\nPSF star, outer\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n1.0\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF814W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF814W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF814W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF814W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF435W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF435W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF435W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF435W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n20\n\nFigure A.1: Result of the completeness test for IRAS 04315-0840.

The solid vertical line\nindicates a completeness level of 95%, the dashed line a level of 90% and the pointed one a level\nof 50%.\n\nThe tests were run by adding artificial stars from apparent magnitudes of 20 to 30,\nin bins of 0.2 mag. We followed several steps to run a completeness for each of the\n50 magnitude bins defined. We first added 1000 artificial stars per bin in a random\nposition inside a field that covers the entire system. Poisson noise was added and only\nstars which were more than 10 pixels apart were selected to avoid contamination between\nthem. Next, we determined in which of the two defined regions with different surface\nbrightness (inner and outer) each artificial star was located. Finally, artificial stars were\nrecovered by performing the photometry in the same way as we did for the knots.\n166\n\n\f\u2206mF814W\n\nC Fraction\n\nPSF star, inner\n\nC Fraction\n\nConvolved PSF, inner\n\nConvolved PSF, outer\n\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n20\n\n\u2206mF435W\n\nPSF star, outer\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n1.0\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF814W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF814W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF814W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF814W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF435W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF435W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF435W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n22\n\n24 26\nmF435W\n\n28\n\n30\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n20\n\nFigure A.2: Result of the completeness test for IRAS 17208-0014. Same labels and completeness levels are showed as in Fig. A.1.\n\nSince the artificial stars were placed in random positions, some could reside in the\nsame position as a real cluster/star/knot in the original image, increasing the measured\nflux. In order to avoid this, we rejected those cases where a recovered magnitude differed\nfrom the input magnitude by more than a certain value. We have taken the value of 0.75\nmag because, as seen in the Figures, the systematic uncertainty for faint magnitudes\nis of the order of 0.4 mag, thus a 2\u03c3 rejection level seems reasonable. False-positive\ndetections with that filtering for the brightest artificial stars are not expected, since few\nreal bright objects are encountered in the images. The completeness at each magnitude\nlevel is computed as the number ratio of recovered over added artificial stars. All the\nprocess was done 10 times and an average completeness value at each magnitude level\nwas computed. Two examples of the result, for the images of IRAS 04315-0840 and IRAS\n17208-0014, are shown in Fig. A.1 and Fig. A.2.\nThe mean difference between input and output magnitudes of the artificial stars\n(\u2206mF 814W and \u2206mF 435W in the Figures) gives an estimate of the aperture correction,\n167\n\n\fAppendix A\n\nCompleteness Tests\n\nwhich is about -0.3 mag for the F814W filter and a value close to -0.25 mag for the\nF435W filter. This is consistent with the aperture corrections applied in the photometry\nof the sources (see Chapter II, Section 2). Its standard deviation also represents a robust\nestimate of the actual photometric error to be associated with each magnitude bin. This\nerror is obviously larger than that computed by Poisson statistics only, especially towards the fainter magnitudes, since the former consider both the systematic and random\nuncertainties (see gray curve in Figures). Therefore, a more realistic uncertainty value\nfor the knots with magnitudes near the 50% completeness limit would move up to 0.3-0.4\nmag.\nThe systems are 90% complete within the intervals mF 814W =[23,25] and\nmF 435W =[25,26.5], but due to the colors of the regions the F435W completeness limit\nusually shifts to brighter magnitudes. We do not see a significant difference in the completeness limits when the PSF is convolved for the F435W filter (less than 0.05 mag),\nbut for the red filter the value of \u2206mF 814W is increased by 0.1 mag when the PSF is\nconvolved. Some difference is expected, since as the PSF widens we recover less flux by\nusing the same aperture.\n\n168\n\n\fAppendix\n\nB\n\nGalfit Analysis\nOverview\nThis Appendix details the technique to perform 2D fits to the\ngalaxy profile in order to derive the effective radius of the galaxies.\n\nTo derive detailed information about the structural properties of our galaxies we performed a 2-dimensional decomposition of them using GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002; Peng\net al. 2010) to fit the light profiles of the F160W images (from NICMOS or the WFC3).\nSince merger systems consists of two or more galaxies, we have taken advantage of GALFITs ability to fit simultaneously multiple components at different spatial regions.\nAlthough most of the galaxies in our sample are ongoing mergers, and hence exhibit\ndisturbed outer disks, in general we did not attempt to obtain a precise model for the\nentire merger system, since the global parameters (i.e., the total galaxy luminosity) are\nnot affected (Peng et al. 2010). Instead, we mainly focused on an accurate measurement\nof the bulge luminosity and central concentration indices, as these parameters provide\nimportant information about the build-up of stellar mass in the center of galaxies during\nthe merger process. The main goal of the fit was to obtain an estimate of the reff of each\ngalaxy and we checked that in general if we try to fit the spiral arms the modeling becomes\nmuch more complicated and the derived reff does not change significantly. Yet, we always\ntried to fit the asymmetric tidal features of the systems , since they can contribute to a\nconsiderable change of the total light of the system (i.e., the determination of the reff ).\nWe performed a careful analysis of each galaxy, also identifying cases where a global\nbulge-disk decomposition would not work.\nRunning GALFIT on an image requires initial preparation. The desired fitting region\nand sky background must be provided, like the PSF image. Images of ULIRGs cover the\nfull extent of the merger, whereas in LIRGs only the central regions are sampled. Thus,\nthe derived reff for LIRGs must be understood as a lower limit to the real value. Sky\nbackgrounds were measured separately using a region where no emission is present and\ndesignated as fixed parameters for all GALFIT procedures.\n169\n\n\fAppendix B\n\nGalfit Analysis\n\nAfter these preparation steps were carried out, we used an iterative process to perform\na 1-3 component decomposition of the images. GALFIT requires initial guesses for\neach component it fits and uses a Levenberg-Marquardt downhill-gradient algorithm to\ndetermine the minimum \u03c72 based on the input guesses. The iterative process is described\nas follows:\n\u2022 We first fitted single S\u00e9rsic profiles that are centered on the galaxies nuclei (typically\n1-2 nuclei per image). The S\u00e9rsic profile has the following form:\n1/ns \u22121]\n\n\u03a3 = \u03a3e e\u2212k[(r/ref f )\n\n(B.1)\n\nwith the effective radius reff , the surface brightness \u03a3e at reff , the power law index ns and k coupled to ns such that half of the total flux is always within reff .\nThe advantage of the S\u00e9rsic profile is that it is very useful for modeling different\ncomponents of a galaxy such as bulges, flat disks, and bars, simply by varying\nthe exponent. As the index ns becomes smaller, the the core flattens faster for\nr < reff , and the intensity drops more steeply for r > reff . Classical bulges typically have a S\u00e9rsic index of n = 4 (in general known as de Vaucouleurs profile), but\ncan vary between 1 < n < 10, while the outer disk follows an exponential profile\n(n = 1). We then added another component (S\u00e9rsic or exponential). When tidal\nfeatures are present we also included in the model Fourier modes, which accounted\nfor asymmetries of the light distribution. The GALFIT output parameters based\non a single S\u00e9rsic profile from the previous step were used as initial parameters\nfor the multi-component fitting. The center coordinates were then fixed for the\nsubsequent fitting steps. For each galaxy, a variety of different multi-component\nfits were performed (typically 1-3; S\u00e9rsic bulge + exponential disk was normally a\ngood solution) and compared afterwards. Fitted models were selected only as long\nas the model parameters were all well behaved, i.e., requiring that all parameters\nsuch as bulge radius and S\u00e9rsic index converged within the range of reasonable\nvalues (e.g., ns < 10). Three examples of GALFIT models and residual (difference\nbetween the original and the modeled image) images are shown in Fig. B.1.\nGALFIT calculates the \u03c72 for each model, which generally declines as more free parameters or S\u00e9rsic components are given. However, a small \u03c72 does not necessarily mean\nthat the solution with an extra component is more correct physically. Thus, we added\nextra components as long as the morphology of the modeled galaxy was improved and\nresembled significantly better that of the F160W image.\nFor objects with central point sources such as an AGN, the bulge S\u00e9rsic index can\nbe overestimated unless an extra nuclear component (PSF component) is added to the\nmodel. We used GALFIT in a first attempt without a central PSF component and calculated the central residual excess light from the residual image of the final fit. In cases\nwhere a central residual was present we re-ran GALFIT with an additional PSF component to take into account the extra central light originating from a central point source.\n170\n\n\fFigure B.1: GALFIT output images for IRAS 04315-0840 (top), IRAS 08355-4944 (middle)\nand IRAS 08572+3915 (bottom). In all cases, from left to right, the original, modeled and\nresidual images are showed. For each system, the three images are drawn using the same\nscale. Faint diffuse emission, spiral structure, and stellar regions remain in the model-subtracted\n(residual) image.\n\nIn general the PSF component did not dominate the total emission of the galaxy, thus\nwas not relevant in the computation of the reff of the galaxy.\nOnce all the components were fitted, the reff of a galaxy was derived by integrating\nits analytical form and computing at which reff the total emission decreased by a half.\n\n171\n\n\f\fBibliography\nAaronson, M. 1983, ApJ, 266, L11, ADS\nAbraham, R.
