Quite recently,\nthe rapid development of complex network theory [2] has\nmotivated the investigation of physical models on such\nsubstrates, for the purpose of identifying new aspects\nthat may stem from novel geometrical constructs [3, 4].\nIndeed, the characterization of their physical properties\nhas shown that new thermodynamic, magnetic and transport features do emerge. In several situations [5], they\ncan become quite distinct from those obtained by other\ndisordered models.\nThe Apollonian network [6](AN) appears in this scenario as an interesting structure, in the sense that it\nshares several properties of complex networks but, on\nthe other hand, it is defined by strict geometrical rules.\nThis particular feature makes it possible to explore scale\ninvariance properties together with numerical methods in\nthe investigation of distinct models. Its specific geometric features induce the emergence of non typical behavior\nin thermodynamic and magnetic properties of spin systems [7, 8], avalanche distribution in sand pile models [9],\nand so on.\nThe recent creation of a synthetic nanometer-scale\nSierpinski hexagonal gasket, a self-similar fractal macromolecule [10] has highly motivated the area of scale invariant networks. This perspective raises the question\nabout electronic systems on these networks.\nThe purpose of this work is to investigate tight-binding\n\nelectronic models on the AN, focusing on the localized vs.\nextended nature of their wave functions. This characterization follows a previous analysis of the properties of the\neigenvalue spectrum of the adjacency matrix (AM) of the\nAN [11]. The AM spectrum is a very important network\nsignature and, as such, its properties have been detailed\nexplored within graph theory. In particular, great attention has been devoted to understanding iso-spectral\ngraphs that are not isomorphic [12, 13].\n\nAs we will show, the Hamiltonian of the uniform tightbinding model can be written in terms of the AM network, so that the energy eigenvalues are proportional to\nthose of the AM. The previous identification of the structure of the spectrum detailed the presence of several distinct classes and highly degenerated subsets. The characterization of the localization properties of the wave function, based on the evaluation of the participation rate of\neach state, follows the classification scheme of different\nsets in the AM spectrum.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we\ndiscuss the main features of the AN. We also introduce\nthe tight-binding model and its matrix. We also indicate how the participation rate has been used to quantify\nthe localization properties of the eigenstates. Section III\nbrings a brief review of the most important properties of\nthe uniform eigenvalue spectrum. Results for the three\ndifferent models are presented in Section IV. Finally, Section V closes the paper with a summary of the our main\nimportant results.\n\n\f2\n2\n\nintegral involving the two wave functions and interaction\npotential.

The adopted site\nnumbering is the one introduced in [7]\n\nII.\n\nTIGHT-BINDING MODELS ON AN\n\nAN's [6, 14] follow from the old problem of optimally\nfilling a compact domain in the Euclidean plane by circles\n[15]. The solution to this problem requires the successive\naddition of maximal tangent circle into the empty regions bounded by three previously placed circles. At a\ngiven generation n, the network ANn is constructed by\nestablishing a connection between the centers of all pairs\nof tangent circles. The solution to the packing problem\nrequires the determination of the center and radius of\neach placed circle. For the AN, however, these details\nare not required, and we just need to assign the pairs\nof nodes that are connected. In this work, we consider\nthe most simple situation, which arises by considering, at\nthe zeroth generation n = 0, three tangent circles with\nthe same radius, the centers of which occupy the corners of a equilateral triangle (see Figure 1). The number of sites N (n) on the network increases according to\nN (n) = (3n + 5)/2, while the number of edges B(n) depends on n as B(n) = (3n+1 + 3)/2. In the limit n \u2192 \u221e,\nB(n)/N (n) \u2192 3, so that each node has, in the average,\n6 neighbors.\nThe resulting AN shares several properties with other\nclasses of complex network, including being scale free (the\ndistribution P (k) of node degree k is a power law), small\nworld (the mean minimal path hli \u223c logN , and hierarchical (the clustering coefficient of individual nodes c(k)\nhas a power law dependence on k). Nevertheless, it has\nown features [16] that precludes being put into the sets\nof networks generated by known algorithms, like those\nproposed by Watts and Strogatz, [17] and Barabasi and\nAlbert [18].\nThe model considers that an electron is primarily\nbound to a network node i with on-site energy \u01ebi , but it\nis also allowed to hop from i to a neighboring site j one\nwith a probability Vi,j = Vj,i , resulting from the overlap\n\n(n)|ii\u01ebi hi| +\n\nX\n\n(i,j)\n\n|iiVi,j hj|,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere |ii represents a Wannier function for an electron\nat position i, and (i, j) denotes pairs of sites that are first\nneighbors.\nThe Hamiltonian (1) can be written in a matrix form,\nwhere the diagonal elements Hi,i = \u01ebi , while off-diagonal\nelements Hi,j are set to Vi,j or 0, depending on whether\nsites i and j are neighbors or not. The AN sites are\nnumbered according to a previously introduced scheme,\nwhich is reproduced in Figure 1 for n = 0, 1, and 2. When\nwe go from generation n to n + 1, the whole n \u2212 th lattice is first squeezed into the region limited by two outer\nvertices and the site at the geometrical center of the triangle. After this first step, two identical copies of the\nsqueezed lattice, rotated by 2\u03c0/3 and 4\u03c0/3, are added to\nthe regions that have been emptied. In this numbering,\ntwo of the outer vertices always take the numbers 1 and\n2, while the third one assumes the number N (n) for generation n. As a consequence, the central node receives\nalways the number N (n \u2212 1). The matrix representation\nof H2 is:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nH2 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u01eb1\nV2,1\nV3,1\nV4,1\nV5,1\n0\nV7,1\n\nV1,2 V1,3\n\u01eb2 V2,3\nV3,2 \u01eb3\nV4,2 V4,3\n0\n0\nV6,2 0\nV7,2 0\n\nV1,4 V1,5 0\nV2,4 0 V2,6\nV3,4 0\n0\n\u01eb4 V4,5 V4,6\nV5,4 \u01eb5\n0\nV6,4 0\n\u01eb6\nV7,4 V7,5 V7,6\n\nV1,7\nV2,7\n0\nV4,7\nV5,7\nV6,7\n\u01eb7\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(2)\n\nThe simple uniform model corresponds to setting \u01ebi =\n\u01eb0 , \u2200i, and Vi,j = V0 , \u2200(i, j). If we let E \u2032 be the eigenvalues of H, we can define new energies E = (E \u2032 \u2212 \u01eb0 )/V0 ,\nwhich can also be directly obtained by rewriting (2), setting \u01eb0 = 0, and V0 = 1. In terms of these new variables, the matrix (2) coincides exactly with the AM of\nthe AN. Thus, the eigen-energies of the homogeneous\ntight-binding model can be directly obtained from the\nAM spectrum discussed previously. For the sake of a\nsimple notation, we will always refer, in the forthcoming\ndiscussion, to the redefined values of E. Note, however,\nthat even for the uniform model, the choice of the on-site\nenergy \u01eb0 can affect the eigenstate localization properties\nWith the exception of the random on-site energy model,\nwe restrict ourselves to investigate the situation in which\n\u01eb0 = 0.\nNon uniform models can be defined by choosing other\nvalues either for the self-energies or the hopping integrals.\nIn this work we consider a family of models defined by\n\u01ebi = 0 \u2200i, and V (i, j) = 1/z \u03b2 . Here, z = (ki +kj )/2 is the\naverage value of the node degrees k, and the value of \u03b2\n\n\f3\nselects a particular element of the set. The uniform model\ncorresponds to setting \u03b2 = 0. Finally, the third model\naims to investigate the existence of Anderson transition\n[19] in AN is defined by setting V( i, j) = 1 for neighboring\nsites, while the \u01ebi are chosen according to a probability\ndistribution function.\nThe solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation H|\u03a8E i =\nE|\u03a8E i can be written in the basis of Wannier states, i.e.,\nP\n|\u03a8E i = N\ni=1 aE,i |ii. The site coefficients aE,i are the\ncomponents of the normalized eigenvector corresponding\nto the eigenvalue E, which are obtained from the numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrices. The\nknowledge of the vector components ai and the possibility of evaluating it as a function of the the subsequent\ngenerations n, suggest the use of the participation ratio \u03be\nto characterize the degree of localization of the electronic\nstates. For normalized states, this often used measure is\ndefined by\n1\n\u03beE,n = PN (n)\n.\n4\ni=1 |aE,i |\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.6\n\n(a)\n\n-0.8\n\n(b)\n\n-0.8\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\n(c)\n\n-0.8\n\nFIG. 2: Illustration of parity properties for three eigenstates\nat generation n = 2: a) Even state corresponding to the\nlargest value E in class C12 ; b) and c) Odd states corresponding to a two-fold degenerate eigenvalue in class C22 .\n\n(3)\n\nIt can assume values in the range [1, N ], which correspond, respectively, to the extreme situations of completely localized (aE,i = 1 for\n\u221a one single value of i), and\nextended states (aE,i = 1/ N , \u2200i). Thus, it provides\nboth an estimate for the localization length \u03bb, as indications for extended states, for which \u03be should scale with\nN (n). Since the model is defined in the limit n \u2192 \u221e, the\nlocalized/extended character of the Apollonian states of\nthe infinite system can be inferred from the behavior of\n\u03beE,n as function of n.\n\nIII.\n\n0.8\n\nSPECTRUM PROPERTIES\n\nThe evaluation of the eigenvalues must be performed\nwith the help of numeric algorithms. The spectrum of the\nuniform model has been characterized in a detailed way.\nIn this particular case, the presence of many eigenvalues\nwith high degree of degeneracy, and the recurrent presence of the same eigenvalues in the successive increasing\nvalues of n, makes it possible to present a classification\nscheme for the eigenvalues E. According to it, for any\nvalue of n \u2265 2, we can cast the eigenvalues into three\nclasses, C1n , C2n , C3n . They comprise, respectively, nondegenerated, two-fold and more than two-fold degenerated eigenvalues.\nA total of D1n = 2n\u22121 + 1 and D2n = 2n eigenvalues\nare found in the classes C1n and C2n . Eigenvalues in these\nclasses do not appear again for any other value of n.\nHowever, the new eigenvalues remain in the proximity\nof the corresponding ones in the former generation. The\nn\nn\ntotal of remaining\n\u0001 eigenvalues in the class C3 is D3 =\n3\nn\u22121\nn\n\u2212 2 + 1 . As the total number of eigenvalues\n2 3\nincreases with 3n , the relative number of states in C1n\nand C2n become vanishingly small as n \u2192 \u221e.\n\nContrary to what is observed with the two first classes,\neigenvalues in C3n are recurrent, i.e., once they are present\nin the spectrum for a given value of n = q, they will be\nfound again for any n > q. Moreover, their degeneracy\nincreases with n in a very precise way. Therefore, the\nnumber of new emerging eigenvalues together with their\ndegeneracy can be quantified according to the following\nscheme: the number of new degenerate eigenvalues that\nemerge at generation q is 2q\u22123 ; at generation n, the degeneracy of any eigenvalue that first appeared at genern\u2212q+2\nation q is dn,q = 3 2 \u22123 . Note that dq,q = 3 always.\nThe first C3 eigenvalues\n\u221a emerging at q = 3 and q = 4 are,\nrespectively, 0 and \u00b1 3. The large degeneracy indicates\nthat the characteristic polynomial is highly factorized.\nNevertheless, this knowledge does not help much in finding exact roots of the polynomials when q \u2265 5.\nIV.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSymmetry properties\n\nWe have scrutinized all eigenstates until n = 9, finding\na clear relationships among several of their properties\nand the classes to which the corresponding eigenvalue\nbelongs. The most direct one refers to the way the states\nreflect the network invariance by 2\u03c0/3 rotations around\nthe central node. Let us define a parity-like property P\nPN\nbased on the value of i=1 aE,i , so that P = odd (even)\nwhen this sum is zero (non-zero). We have found that,\nfor any P = even state, all sets of three equivalent sites,\ni.e., the three sites that are mapped onto one another by\nrotation of the network by 2\u03c0/3 and 4\u03c0/3 around the\ncentral site, share exactly the same amplitude aE . The\nsame amplitude is found for all sites that are mapped\n\n\f4\nonto one another by inversion operations over the three\nbisectrices of the original triangle. All C1n states are even\nand, conversely, all C2n and C3n states are odd.\nHowever, we find two kinds of P = odd states, depending on whether they belong to the C2n or C3n classes.\nIrrespective of the particular class, the amplitude at the\ncentral site for any odd state vanishes identically, i.e.,\n(aE,i=N (n\u22121) = 0).\nIn Figure 2 a-c we illustrate some features of three\nstates when n = 2. They correspond, respectively, to\n(1)\nthe largest eigenvalue E7 , which always belongs to Cn ,\nand to the second largest two-fold degenerated eigenvalue\n\u221a\n(2)\nE5 , E6 = \u2212( 5 + 1)/2, which is in the class C2 . As\nexemplary shown for n = 2, the largest eigenvalue state\nhas only positive components (absence of nodes). The\ntwo states corresponding to E5,6 have odd parity and are\nclearly orthogonal.\nThe states in C2n are such that, for each set of three\nequivalent sites (by rotation of the network by 2\u03c0/3 and\n4\u03c0/3 around the central site), the sum of the amplitudes\nai is zero. However, no inversion symmetry, as found for\neven states, are observed.\nThe states in C3n do not have the same general rotation\nsymmetry around the central site, but a large number\nof local 2\u03c0/3 rotational symmetries. Indeed, we found\nthat, if the corresponding eigenvector appeared for the\nfirst time in C3q , at generation n it contains N (n \u2212 q + 2)\nnodes with zero amplitudes, including the central one.\nFor instance, when n = 4, all 12 states corresponding to\nE = 0, which appears for the first time when n = q = 3,\nhave N (3) = 16 sites with vanishing\namplitude. The\n\u221a\n3 states corresponding to E = 3, which appears for\nn = q = 4, have 7 sites with vanishing amplitudes. The\nsites with vanishing amplitudes are exactly those sites\nthat are present in the network at generation n \u2212 q + 2.\nFurther, each set of three sites that appears around these\nzero amplitude sites at generation n \u2212 q + 3, have the\nproperty that the sum to the corresponding amplitudes\nzero. This is illustrated in the Figure 2d, when n = q = 3,\nfor a state with eigenvalue E = 0.\nB.\n\nLocalization properties\n\nThe localization properties of the quantum states were\nevaluated with the help of equation 3. The general features of the results are displayed in Figure 3 where, in\norder to better compare the values of \u03be for different values of n, we draw the value of \u03be(i)/N (n) for individual\nstates i. As the spectrum is highly degenerated, the label\ni is chosen to be, in first place, an increasing function of\nthe energy. Then, within a degenerated level, the states\nare labeled according to increasing values of \u03be. Since the\nhorizontal axis has also been scaled to 1 by dividing i/N ,\nthe graphs show a recurrent form, with the presence of\never fine details as the value of n increases.\nSo, despite the shown patterns seem quite irregular,\nit is possible to identify large windows where the value\n\n1.0\n\n____N=124\n____N=367\n____N=1096\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n[i/N\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\ni / N 0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFIG. 3: Dependence of \u03bei /N with respect to i/N for n =\n6, 7, 8, and 9.

(a) and (b) correspond to states with E = 0 and,\nrespectively, smallest and largest value of \u03be. In (c) we show\n\u221a\nthe state with largest value of \u03be, in the class C27 and E = 3.\nThe increasing value of \u03be stays in close correspondence with\nthe trend to change from localized to extended character.\n\nof \u03be/N increases monotonically. These structures correspond the highly degenerate levels of C3n class, where\nthe individual states have been classified according to increasing values of \u03be. This behavior make it clear that\nthe states corresponding to degenerate levels have own\nparticular features.\nThe behavior of the states corresponding to the classes\nC1n and C2n are much difficult to be perceived in Figure\n3, as they are immersed into the overwhelmingly larger\nnumber of C3n states. However, the behavior of some of\nthem, at specific positions in the spectrum, can be identified. For instance, the states corresponding to smallest\nand largest value of E, both in C1n \u2200n, have very low values of \u03be. On the other hand, C1n and C2n states that pren\ncede the large\n\u221a C3 windows, like those just before E = 0\nand E = 3, are characterized by quite large values of\n\u03be.\nIn Figure 4a and 4b, we plot the absolute value of local\namplitudes for two n = 7 states: i = 125 and i = 244,\n\n\f5\n\n[\n\n[\n\n100\n\n1/2\n\nE = 0, largest D ~ 0.92\n\n100\n\n10\n\n10\n\nE = 0, smallest D ~ 0.40\n1\n\nE = - 3 , largest D ~ 0.89\n\n1/2\n\nE = - 3 , smallest D ~ 0.81\n\n1\n100\n\n1000\n\n100\n\nN\n\n1000\n\nN\n\n[\n\n[\n\n100\n\n100\n\nE ~ 0,72, D=0.99\n\nE ~ 1.23, D = 1.0\n10\n\n10\n\ni=1, E = smallest eigenvalue, D = 0.05\n1\n\n1\n100\n\n1000\n\nN\n\ni=2, E = second smallest eigenvalue,\nD = 0.09\n100\n\n1000\n\nN\n\nFIG. 5: Participation ratio \u03be for some specific states, as function of N , \u221a\nfor generations n = 4, 5, 6 and 7. (a) E = 0 and\n(b) E = \u2212 3 correspond to states of class C3n . (c) and (d)\nillustrate localized and extended states belonging classes C1n\nand C2n , respectively.\n\nboth with energy E = 0 and, respectively, smallest and\nlargest value of \u03be. It is possible to visualize that the state\nwith smallest value of \u03be is characterized by a few large\namplitude spikes, distinguish themselves from the much\nlower amplitudes in the remaining sites. This picture\ncontrasts with that for i = 243, where the amplitudes\nare homogeneously distributed over all sites, evidencing\nproperties of an extended state. Figure 4c, for the C2n\nstate i = 286, with energy E \u2243= 1.0495, shows a pattern\nsimilar to that in 4b, in agreement with the indication of\nan extended state (\u03be/N = 0.4181).\nTo characterize the state properties in the n \u2192 \u221e\nlimit, it is necessary to follow the behavior of \u03be with n.\nAs discussed before, truly extended states obey a linear\ndependence between \u03be(n) and N (n). However, as the\nnumber of states increases with the size of the system,\na criterion must be defined to make the correspondence\namong the states in different generations n. For states\nin C3n , such correspondence is easier to be made, as the\neigenvalues in one generation will be present in all further\ngenerations. As this does not happen for eigenvalues in\nC1n and C2n , we will compare them by their relative positions to the eigenvalues in the class C3n .\nIn Figure 5, we show the dependence of \u03be on the number of sites N for some selected states, from which it\nis possible to evaluate the exponent \u03b1 in \u03be \u223c N \u03b1 . In\nFigure 5a, the two states with E = 0 and smallest and\nlargest values of \u03be are characterized by \u03b1 = 0.40 and 0.92,\nrespectively. The indication of localized and extended\ncharacter confirm the overall picture shown in Figure 4.\nThe result\n\u221a in Figure 5b, for the corresponding states of\nE = \u2212 3, reveal a much smaller variation in the value of\n\u03b1 \u2208 [0.805, 0.897] for the states corresponding to extreme\nvalues of \u03be. Similar results are obtained for other values\nof E in C3n , with a clear indication that, despite the oc-\n\nFIG. 6: (a)Dependence on N of the average participation\nratio h\u03bei, for generations n = 5, 6, 7 and 8. All states with\nenergy E = 0 have been casted into 10 groups, according to\ntheir values of \u03be. The values of the different slopes, drawn\nin the inset, indicate that most states are extended. (b) The\nparticipation ratio probability distribution P (\u03be/N ) of states\nwith E = 0, for n = 7, 8, and 9, is largely concentrated on\nlarge values of \u03be/N for all n. This is in accordance with (a).\n\ncurrence of some localized states, the results in this class\nhave a grater tendency of containing states with extended\ncharacter.\nStates of the C1n class can display both localized and\nextended character as indicated by the sequence of values of \u03be for the largest and smallest eigenvalue and for\nthe state with largest value of \u03be. While small slopes\n\u03b1 = 0.051 obtained for the sequence of smallest eigenvalues (Figure 6c) indicate localization, the state with\nE \u2243 1.239, characterized by \u03b1 \u2243 1, which maximizes the\nvalue of \u03be in all generations, shows the opposite extended\npattern. Similarly, states in class C2n can display both localized and extended character, as shown in Figure 5d. In\nthe first one, the behavior of \u03be indicates localized nature\nfor the pair of states corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue, while extended properties are obtained for\nthe pairs of states with E \u2243 0.72. In both cases, small\nvales of \u03b1 hints at a strong localization character. On the\nother hand, extended properties are found for the\n\u221a series\nof eigenvalues that precede the eigenvalue E = 3.\nSince the relative number of states in classes C1n and\nn\nC1 decrease with n, let us concentrate on the properties\nof C3n states. A further characterization of their localization character can be provided by taking the average\nvalues of \u03be for the states with the same eigenvalue. For\nthis purpose, for each value of n, the states to each degenerated eigenvalue have be divided into 10 groups, according increasing values of \u03be. Then, as in Figure 5, we\ndraw in Figure 6a h\u03be(n)i as function of N (n). The values of \u03b1 for each subset show, consistently, a tendency\nto accumulate at a large values \u2265 1.0. Another way to\nconfirm the result is to draw the the participation ratio\nprobability distribution P (\u03be/N ) as function of \u03be/N (see\nFigure 6b). For three increasing generations, the position of the peaks of P indicates that the values of \u03be for\nE = 0 states increase linearly with the size of the system,\nso that their extended nature is preserved in the limit of\ninfinite system. These features support our claims of a\noverwhelming extended character of states in the uniform\n\n\f6\n\u2206\n0.01\n0.1\n0.2\n0.5\n\n\u03b1\n0.61\n0.42\n0.38\n0.36\n\nTABLE I: Dependence of the localization parameter \u03b1 on disorder strength \u2206. For all investigated values of \u2206, a strong reduction in the value of \u03b1 in comparison to the uniform model\nis noticed, indicating complete state localization.\n\nD.\n\nFIG. 7: Dependence of \u03bei /N with respect to i/N for n = 6, 7,\nand 8 for \u03b2 = 1 (a) and \u03b2 = \u22121 (b). The states are labeled\nby increasing values of E. In (c), we show the dependence\nof h\u03b1i with respect to \u03b2, with a clear indication of a sudden\nchange in the nature of the states for \u03b2 = 3.\n\nmodel.\n\nC.\n\nLocalization properties of the non-uniform\nmodel\n\nLet us now discuss the properties of non uniform model\nmentioned in Section II, where V (i, j) = 1/z \u03b2 . Positive values of \u03b2 decrease the relative hopping probability\nfrom electrons in the largely connected hubs. So, in principle, we should expect a decrease in the electron mobility and a tendency for localized states. The opposite\nhappens for negative values of \u03b2, where the hopping of\nelectrons from the hubs is enhanced, strengthening the\nmobility. Since the V (i, j) non-uniformity destroys the\nexact scheme based on three well defined classes, it is\nnow better to provide an analysis of the average behavior of the states, rather than following them individually.\nOur results are summarized in Figure 7. For two distinct values of \u03b2 = \u00b11, we qualitatively see, in Figure 7a\nand 7b, that the dependence of participation ratio \u03be/N\nwith respect to i/N has been distorted with respect to\nthat of \u03b2 = 0 (Figure 3). Nevertheless, it is still possible\nto identify the position of the \u03b2 = 0 highly degenerated\nC3n eigenvalues. In order to quantify the change in the localization properties as function of \u03b2, we draw in Figure\n7c the behavior of the average value of the state slopes\nh\u03b1i with respect to \u03b2. The abrupt change in the average\nvalue of h\u03b1i at \u03b2 = 3 hints to an extended-localized transition of the wave function at this value. This behavior\nis in accordance with the discussion in the beginning of\nthis subsection.\n\nAnderson transition\n\nIn this subsection we briefly point out the most important features of the eigenstates that result from introducing disorder into the tight binding model. In\nthis case, the on-site energy \u01ebi is considered as a random independent variable, describing the local disorder that disturbs the motion of electrons. \u01ebi is considered an variable characterized by a probability function\nP (\u01ebi ) = \u03a6(\u2206/2 \u2212 |\u01ebi |)/\u2206, with \u03a6 being the step function.\nThe parameter \u2206 is a measure for the disorder strength,\nand the main purpose is to identify the possible existence\nof a Anderson transition for some finite value of \u2206.\nAs observed in the discussion of the non-uniform\nmodel, the introduction of the disorder breaks the high\ndegree of degeneracy of the C3n states, as well as the\nthree classes scheme observed in the energy spectrum of\nthe uniform model. Thus, we resort again to a discussion\nof the average properties of the states as a dependency\nof the energy interval.\nThe Anderson transition has been studied taking the\naverage values of \u03be for the all states around energy\n|E| \u2264 \u03b4E, with \u03b4E = 0.001. The results are summarized in Table 1, where we present obtained values of\nh\u03b1i as function of \u2206. The results have been obtained by\nperforming M different realizations where, respectively,\nM = 1000, 300 and 50 for n = 6, 7 and 8.\nThe results in Table 1 can be compared with those\nobtained for similar models built on complex network\nstructures. Indeed, Anderson transition investigations\non scale-free networks have shown that the localization\nof the electronic states is influenced by the connectivity of\nthe network. Thus, the fractal dimension quantifies the\ncritical disorder [20, 21]. Our investigation confirms that\nthe possibility of the absence of a Anderson transition at\nhighly connected networks, as observed in Ref. [20].\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we presented a very broad investigation of\nthe properties of the eigenstates of a tight binding model\non the Apollonian network. We considered the uniform\nmodel and two further model versions, where we could\ninvestigate, respectively, the influence of non uniformity\ninduced by the network geometry and by random on-site\n\n\f7\nenergies in the eigenstate properties.\nIn the regular case, we could establish a precise relationship between the three different classes in which\nthe eigenvalue spectrum can be divided and parity properties of the corresponding eigenvectors. We have shown\nthat localization property is not related to the eigenvalue\nclasses, by the identification of eigenstates, with localized\nand extended properties, within each of the classes. However, as the number of states in the class C3n increases\nmuch faster with n than those of the other two classes,\nwe proceeded with a quantification of the average participation ratio of the C3n states. The results indicate\na scenario in which extended states dominate the global\nbehavior of the system.\nBy including an explicit dependence of the node degree on their ability to decrease or increase the electron\nmobility, we have shown that the general state properties can change from the quoted extended character into\na localized one. Our results were based on the ansatz\nthat the interaction strength decays with the node de-\n\ngree according to a power law. It was possible to obtain\na positive critical value for the change in the property of\nthe states.\nFinally, the model has shown to be much more sensitive\nto state localization when random on-site energies are\nassigned to each site. Our results suggest that for any\nnon-zero amount of randomness, all states, even those in\nthe neighborhood of the band center, assume localized\nnature.\nPhysical models constructed on AN's are known to produce quite unusual properties. These are due mostly on\nthe the existence of large degree nodes as well as with\nthe existence of large number of loops. Because of this,\nit is not possible to affirm that other non-uniform disordered models on AN will not present other non-expected\nfeatures.\nAcknowledgement: This work was partially supported by CNPq.
