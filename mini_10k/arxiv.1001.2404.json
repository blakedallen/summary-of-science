On the one hand, dust extinction hampers\na complete census of the active SMBHs in the Universe in case of optical/UV surveys, on the other\n\n1\n\n\fhand, the AGN light is absorbed by the obscuring\nmedium and then re-emitted at near- and mid-IR\nwavelengths.\nUsing the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)\n(e.g., Skrutskie et al. 2006, and references therein),\nCutri et al. (2002) have recently unveiled a population of highly-reddened (J \u2212 Ks > 2) quasars\nat an average redshift of hzi \u223c 0.22 whose number density is almost comparable to that of the\noptically-selected quasars, selected on the basis of the UV-blue color excess criterion (e.g.,\nRisaliti & Elvis 2004; Hall et al. 2006). Most of\nthese 2MASS sources are previously unidentified\nquasars (Francis et al. 2004; Glikman et al. 2004;\nLeipski et al. 2005; Urrutia et al. 2009). Optical follow-up observations have revealed that the\nbulk of this extragalactic population is composed\nby broad-line AGNs with a significant number of\nintermediate type objects (i.e. Type 1.2\u20131.9). In\nparticular, it has been found that: (i) their median\nspectral energy distribution (SED) is redder in the\noptical/UV band than that of the best-studied,\nclassical blue quasars (e.g. Elvis et al. 1994), (ii)\nthey are primarily reddened by dust (AV \u223c 1\u20135\nmag) rather than being intrinsically red sources,\n(iii) these objects usually exhibit a high optical\npolarization level (\u2248 3\u201315%) suggesting that the\npolarization is due to scattering of nuclear light by\nmaterial located close to the active nucleus, but\nexterior to the BLR (Kuraszkiewicz et al. 2009a;\nSmith et al. 2003). Such an aspect is very intriguing since \u223c20% of 2MASS AGNs exhibit the same\nbroad emission lines both in the polarized flux and\nin the total flux spectrum. This indicates that a\nsizable fraction of the observed optical AGN emission must have scattered into our direction and, in\nturn, suggests caution in the use of spectral type\n(Type 1 versus Type 2) as indicator of orientation\nin AGNs (Schmidt et al. 2007).\nThe observed properties of red quasars can be\ninterpreted in terms of intermediate viewing angles where the AGN is viewed through the edge\n(or atmosphere) of the torus or a clumpy accretion disk wind. Accordingly, the observed broadband emission is the likely combination of direct,\nreprocessed and scattered emission components\n(e.g., Smith et al. 2003; Wilkes et al. 2008). In\naddition, as pointed out by Kuraszkiewicz et al.\n(2009a), both obscuration and emission from the\ncircumnuclear gas and the host galaxy play a cru-\n\ncial role in shaping the SED of red 2MASS quasars.\nIt is also worth noting that a small (\u224810\u201315%)\npercentage of classical, blue quasars is unavoid< 0.4, by the\nably collected, especially at z \u223c\nJ \u2212 Ks > 2 selection criterion (Barkhouse & Hall\n2001). Also in Kuraszkiewicz et al. (2009a), it\nis shown that some unreddened (i.e. AV = 0\u2013\n1 mag) Type 1 sources with high Eddington ratios (L/LEdd) and large amounts of hot circumnuclear dust are picked up within their sample of red\n2MASS quasars. However, since the J \u2212 Ks color\nselection is inhomogeneous with redshift, at higher\nredshifts less contamination from blue AGNs will\noccur (as J \u2212Ks color resembles more a rest frame\noptical color) and the red J \u2212 Ks selection will\nmostly gather AGNs that are truly dust-reddened.\nMore sophisticated selection processes involving multiwavelength (i.e. radio, optical, infrared)\ndata have recently allowed to reveal red quasars\n(i.e. with J \u2212 Ks >1.7 and R \u2212 Ks >4.0)\n> 1, such as in the case of the VLA\nup to z \u223c\nFIRST-2MASS (FTM hereafter) survey published\nby Glikman et al. (2007). They estimate that red\nquasars account for between 25% and 60% of the\ntotal quasar population with Ks < 14 mag.\nThe nature and the evolutionary properties of\nred quasars are still open issues. It is worth noting that the classical, non-red AGN population,\ni.e. with a 2MASS color J \u2212 Ks < 2, indeed\ncomprises a mixed bag of objects spanning from\nunobscured blue quasars to Seyfert 2-like AGNs\nshowing only narrow lines in their optical spectra and absorbed (even with Compton-thick, i.e.\nNH > 1024 cm\u22122 , column densities) at X-rays (e.g.\nWatanabe et al. 2004; Alonso-Herrero et al. 1998;\nGorjian et al. 2004; Zakamska et al. 2004). In particular, what is the place of red broad-line quasars\nin the AGN unification scheme and their role in\nthe context of AGN and galaxy co-evolution? Are\nthey standard systems observed along a special\nline of sight for which both nuclear and host galaxy\nobscuration are important (Kuraszkiewicz et al.\n2009a), i.e. alternative to that of two classical populations of unobscured broad-lined quasars and\nthat of heavily obscured, narrow-lined quasars?\nAlternatively, can they (especially if they are at\n> 0.4\u20130.5) be interpreted as a peculiar dustz \u223c\ncocooned stage in the life cycle of quasars, possibly\nassociated with the assembly of the host galaxy?\nIntriguingly, HST images available for a sam2\n\n\fple of dust-reddened FTM quasars with MB \u2264\n< z < 1 show disturbed opti\u221223 and 0.4 \u223c\n\u223c\ncal morphologies in the vast majority (85%) of\nthem with evidence of ongoing merging, interactions and multiple nuclei (Urrutia et al. 2008;\nHutchings et al. 2006), unlike blue quasars being\nmostly hosted in undisturbed elliptical or bulgedominated galaxies as found in HST imaging studies of optically-selected luminous quasars at z\n< 1 (e.g., Dunlop et al. 2003; Floyd et al. 2004;\nSanchez et al. 2004, see also Bennert et al. 2008).\nEvidence is mounting that distant red quasars\nmight indeed represent a dust-enshrouded phase\nin quasar evolution linked with the host galaxy\nassembly via repeated mergers (Georgakakis et al.\n2009; Urrutia et al. 2009). This phase should be\ncharacterized by the presence of massive nuclear\nwinds expelling/heating most of the cold gas reservoir and merger debris in the host galaxy, and\nso rendering progressively visible the quasar as\nan optically-bright source (the so-called feedback\nprocesses, e.g. Silk & Rees (1998); Hopkins et al.\n(2006)).\nA deep exploration of the X-ray spectral properties of red quasars is therefore important to improve our understanding of the structure of AGNs\nand their cosmological evolution. The combination of a favorable line of sight inclination and\nobscuration can indeed provide a unique view\nof spectral components usually overwhelmed by\nthe AGN light in blue quasars (Schmidt et al.\n2007; Pounds et al. 2005).\nThe X-ray spectral properties of unobscured, optically-selected,\nradio-quiet quasars have been largely investigated in the past (Laor et al. 1997; George et al.\n2000; Piconcelli et al. 2005), especially in case\nof medium-luminosity objects showing an X-ray\nluminosity of LX < 5 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . They\nappear to be quite homogeneous and without\nany evidence for significant evolution with z\n(Just et al. 2007; Page et al. 2005; Piconcelli et al.\n2003; Vignali et al. 2003a), although the strength\nof spectral features due to the reprocessing of\nthe primary continuum (such as Fe K\u03b1 emission line and Compton hump) is still largely\nunconstrained for high luminosity quasars with\n> 1045 erg s\u22121 (Mineo et al. 2000; Page et al.\nLX \u223c\n2005; Jimenez-Bailon et al. 2005).\nOn the contrary, the X-ray properties of red luminous quasars still remain poorly explored. Af-\n\nter their discovery, a handful of programs aimed\nat studying the X-ray properties of these AGNs\nhave been undertaken. Chandra (Wilkes et al.\n2002; Hall et al. 2006; Urrutia et al. 2005, hereafter U05) and XMM\u2013Newton shallow observations (Wilkes et al. 2005; Pounds et al. 2005)\nof \u223c20-30 2MASS quasars indicate the quasiubiquitous presence of cold absorption with\n<\n<\n1021 \u223c\nNH \u223c\n1023 cm\u22122 regardless of optical type.\nThis matches with the finding that only \u224810% of\nthe red 2MASS AGNs are detected in the ROSAT\nFaint Source Survey (Cutri et al. 2002).\nBearing in mind the small sample size to\ndate, broad-line red quasars seem to show a wide\nrange of spectral types in the X-ray band unlike\ntheir blue counterparts. In particular, two results from X-ray spectroscopy of red quasars can\nbe considered of special interest: (i) a number\nof these sources have an unusually flat hard Xray continuum with \u03932\u221210 <1.5 (e.g. Vignali et al.\n2000; Wilkes et al. 2005; Pounds & Wilkes 2007;\nWilkes et al. 2008), probably due to the presence\nof an intense Compton reflection component, and\n(ii) some broad-line red AGNs exhibit a \"softexcess\" component below \u223c1-2 keV that can be\ninterpreted as the result of absorption and reemission from the same weakly ionized (outflowing) gas (Pounds et al. 2005; Pounds & Wilkes\n2007).\nIn this paper, we present the first high-quality\nX\u2013ray spectrum, obtained with XMM\u2013Newton,\nof the luminous red quasar FTM 0830+3759 at\nz=0.413. A very short 9 ks Chandra observation\nrevealed a very steep continuum and the possible\npresence of puzzling emission/absorption line-like\nfeatures at energies which do not correspond to\nany obvious rest-frame atomic transition (U05).\nWe assume throughout this paper H0 = 70 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 , \u03a9\u039b = 0.73 and \u03a9M = 0.27 (Spergel et al.\n2007).\n2.\n\nOptical and Radio Properties of FTM\n0830+3759\n\nFTM 0830+3759 (J\u2212K = 2.28, e.g. Glikman et al.\n2007) is the X-ray brightest object included in\nthe U05 sample of 12 broad-line, dust-reddened\nquasars selected from the FTM survey.

The value of RL\nderived for FTM 0830+3759 is \u2248 30, and the steep\nradio spectral index (\u03b11.4GHz/8.3GHz = \u22121.06) derived by Glikman et al. (2007) also supports the\nmoderate radio-loud nature of this quasar.\nFTM 0830+3759 is also included in the HST\nstudy of a sample of 13 dust-reddened FTM\nquasars performed by Urrutia et al. (2008). HST\nACS Wide Field Camera images reveal that the\nhost galaxy of FTM 0830+3759 shows a lot of irregularities near the nucleus along the major axis.\nA prominent structure with a ionization cone morphology is present: it can be interpreted as due to\nmerger-induced star formation regions or to the\npresence of outflowing gas. After an accurate PSF\nfitting and host galaxy subtraction, Urrutia et al.\n(2008) measured a MB = \u221223.07 mag and a reddening of E(B \u2212 V ) = 1.29 for the quasar in FTM\n0830+3759. The inferred value of the nucleus\nto host ratio for the I magnitude (F814W filter)\nwas 0.55. Interestingly, Urrutia et al. (2008) also\nfound a possible correlation between the magnitude of galaxy interactions and the level of obscuration affecting the quasar. This led them to\nprovide a possible explanation of the red nature\nof FTM quasars in terms of reddening occurring\nin the host galaxy.\n\nFinally, there is no detailed information on the\noptical classification of FTM 0830+3759 in the\nliterature besides it is a broad-line AGN. However, the optical spectrum reported in Fig. 1 of\nUrrutia et al. (2008) suggests that an intermediate (i.e. Type 1.5) classification for this source\nmay be considered plausible, although a proper\ninvestigation on this issue is required.\n3.\n\nXMM-Newton Observation and Data\nReduction\n\nWe observed the quasar FTM 0830+3759 with\nXMM\u2013Newton (Jansen et al. 2001) on November\n8, 2008 for about 52 ks (Obs. ID.: 0554540201).\nThe observation was performed with the EPIC\nPN and MOS cameras operating in Full-Window\nmode and with the THIN filter applied. Data\nwere reduced with SAS v8.0.0 using standard procedures and the most updated calibration files\navailable at the date of the analysis (April 2009)\nwere used. X-ray events corresponding to patterns 0\u20134(0\u201312) for the PN(MOS) cameras were\nselected. The event lists were filtered to ignore\nperiods of high background flaring according to\nthe method presented in Piconcelli et al. (2004)\nbased on the cumulative distribution function of\nbackground lightcurve count-rates. After screening the final net exposure times were 41 and 48 ks\nfor PN and MOS, respectively.\nThe source photons were extracted for the\nPN(MOS) camera from a circular region with a\nradius of 29(30) arcsec centered at the peak of\nthe emission, while the background counts were\nestimated from a 52(49) arcsec radius source4\n\n\ffree region on the same chip and close to FTM\n0830+3759 without being contaminated by the\ntarget itself.\nThe redistribution matrix files and ancillary response files were created using the SAS task RMFGEN and ARFGEN, respectively. As the difference between the MOS1 and the MOS2 response matrices is a few percent, we created a combined MOS spectrum and response matrix. The\nbackground-subtracted spectra for the PN and the\ncombined MOS cameras were then simultaneously\nfitted. Spectra were rebinned so that each energy\nbin contains at least 20 counts to allow us to use\nthe \u03c72 minimization technique in spectral fitting.\nDuring the XMM\u2013Newton observation the flux\nof FTM 0830+3759 remained steady, with no variation exceeding 2\u03c3 from the average count-rate\nlevel in both soft- and hard-X-ray band. Since\nno significant spectral changes occurred, the spectral analysis was performed on the spectrum integrated over the full exposure time.\n\nIn this Section we present the spectral analysis\nof the EPIC observation of FTM 0830+3759 that\nwas carried out using the XSPEC v11.3 software\npackage (Arnaud 1996). The Galactic column density of NGal\n= 3.61 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 derived from\nH\nKalberla et al. (2005) was adopted in all the fits.\nIn the following, errors correspond to the 90%\nconfidence level for one interesting parameter, i.e.\n\u2206\u03c72 = 2.71 (Avni 1976).\n\nFig. 1 (left panel) shows the result of this simple\nfit extrapolated to 0.3 keV. The broad and deep\ndeficit in the soft X-ray band clearly suggests the\npresence of strong absorption. Fitting the data\nover the 0.3-9 keV band with an unrealistic powerlaw model yielded a \u0393 \u223c0.72.\nTo reproduce the shape of the soft X-ray spectrum we initially applied a model consisting of a\npower law modified by intrinsic, rest-frame cold\nmatter absorption. This fit was statistically unacceptable with \u03c72\u03bd /dof = 1.95/324, revealing additional spectral complexity. In particular, an excess\nin the data/model residuals emerges at energies\nbelow 0.6 keV (e.g. Fig. 1, right panel).\nTo further explore the nature of the obscuring material along our line of sight we modeled\nthe low-energy drop by replacing the neutral absorber with a photoionized absorber component.\nThe latter was modeled in XSPEC adopting the\npublicly available output table \"grid 18\"1 of the\nXSTAR code (Kallman & Bautista 2001). In this\nmodel the state of the warm absorber is a function of the ionization parameter \u03be defined as \u03be =\nL/nr2 , where L is the isotropic luminosity of the\npower-law ionizing source in the interval 13.6 eV\nto 13.6 keV, n is the density of the plasma and\nr represents the radial distance from the central\nsource. In the fit solar elemental abundances were\nassumed and \u03be was left as a free parameter. However, this fit, with \u03c72\u03bd /dof=1.05/323, was not entirely effective in reproducing the EPIC data as\nbroad positive residuals were still present between\n0.5 and 0.7 keV.\n\n4.1.\n\n4.2.\n\n4.\n\nSpectral Analysis\n\nPreliminary Fits\n\nAs a first step we fitted the hard portion of\nthe EPIC spectra at E>2.5 keV (corresponding\nto 3.5 keV in the source frame) with a power law\nto achieve a preliminary description of the X-ray\nprimary continuum emission in an energy range\nexpected to be much less affected by absorption\nthan soft X-rays. The emission line, observed at\n\u223c 4.5 keV (6.4 keV in the quasar frame), was\nmodelled with a narrow Gaussian line with energy and normalization free to vary (see Sect. 4.3\nfor more details). This model is a good fit to the\nEPIC data, i.e. \u03c72\u03bd /dof = 1.02/174. We measured\na \u0393 = 1.37\u00b10.08 that is significantly flatter than\nthe average hard X-ray slope h\u0393i \u2248 1.85 found for\noptically-selected quasars (Piconcelli et al. 2005).\n\nComplex models\n\nIn order to account for the soft-excess component, we then included an additional unabsorbed\npower-law fixing its photon index to that of the\nabsorbed power law but with a different normalization. Such a parametrization typically provides an excellent description of the X-ray spectrum of many well-studied Compton-thin AGNs,\nin which the soft-excess is due to a combination of\nemission from scattered continuum photons and\ndistant photoionized gas (e.g. Turner et al. 1997;\nWinter et al. 2009; De Rosa et al. 2008). This fit\nresulted in a \u03c72\u03bd /dof = 0.99/323 yielding a dra1 See\n\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/xstar/xstar.html\nfor further details\n\n5\n\n\f0.1\n0.01\n10\u22123\n\nnormalized counts/sec/keV\nratio\n\n0.5 1 1.5 2\n\n1\n2\nchannel energy (keV)\n\n5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n2\nchannel energy (keV)\n\n5\n\n2\n\n4\n\nratio\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0.5\n\nFig. 1.- Left: Continuum power-law fit (+ a Gaussian emission line at \u223c 6.4 keV rest-frame) to the 2.5-9\nkeV band of the PN (top) and MOS (bottom) spectra of FTM 0830+3759 extrapolated over the 0.3-9 keV\nband.

Right: The data/model ratio residuals resulting\nfrom fitting an absorbed power law to the 0.3-9 keV EPIC data (circles and empty squares are the PN and\nMOS residuals, respectively).

We measured a photon index\nof \u0393 = 1.51\u00b10.06 and a column density of NH =\n(1.86\u00b10.16) \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 of the neutral absorber,\nwhile the ratio between the normalization of the\nunabsorbed and absorbed PL is fs = 0.13\u00b10.02.\nTable 2 lists the best-fit values of the relevant spectral parameters obtained by this fit, hereafter referred as NP model.\nA warm absorber model (WP) was then tested,\nusing again the \"grid 18\" XSTAR table. This fit\nyielded \u03c72\u03bd /dof = 0.97/322 with an improvement\nat >95.6% confidence level according to an F \u2212test\nonce compared with the NP model. We derived\nthe following best-fit values for the physical parameters of the warm gas: a column density of\nNH \u223c 2.4 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 and an ionization parameter of \u03be \u223c 15 erg cm s\u22121 .\nWe note that leaving the photon index of the\nunabsorbed power law free to vary in both NP\nand WP models gave values that are consistent\nwith the photon index of the continuum and did\nnot produce any appreciable improvement in the\nquality of the fits.\n\n2002).\nUnfortunately, the combination of EPIC resolution, intermediate column density of the X-ray\nabsorber and moderate soft X-ray flux of FTM\n0830+3759 heavily hampers the detection of these\nemission lines in the XMM\u2013Newton spectrum presented here. This implies that we were not able to\ndiscriminate between the two proposed scenarios\nfor the soft-excess emission and, in turn, provide\nunambiguous constraints on the covering fraction\nof the absorber in FTM 0830+3759. This aspect\nshould be borne in mind while interpreting all\nthe results from the spectral analysis presented\nhereafter. Furthermore, we cannot use the high\nresolution RGS data to shed light on this issue\nsince FTM 0830+3759 is too faint at soft X-rays\nto be detected by the RGS with sufficient signal\nto allow a useful spectral analysis.\nGiven the flatness of continuum slope measured\nwith the NP and WP models, i.e. \u0393 \u223c1.5, we\nattempted to explain it as the result of a combination of an underlying steep continuum modified by a cold/warm absorber plus a Compton reflection component from neutral matter (pexrav\nmodel in XSPEC, Magdziarz & Zdziarski (1995)),\nwith the metal abundances of the reflector fixed\nto the solar value and its inclination angle fixed\nto 65 deg. The addition of this spectral component produced a steeping of the photon index\nto \u0393 \u22481.85-1.9. However the measured value of\nthe reflection fraction R \u223c 3 (defined as \u03a9/2\u03c0,\nwhere \u03a9 is the solid angle subtended by the reflector for isotropic incident emission) is largely\nunconstrained and implies an unphysical covering factor of neutral reflecting material of Cf >\n1 and/or anisotropy in the irradiation. Such a\nvalue is well outside the range typically observed\n< R\nfor radio-quiet broad-line AGNs, i.e. 0.6 \u223c\n< 1.2 (Perola et al. 2002; Deluit & Courvoisier\n\u223c\n2003; Nandra et al. 2007; Panessa et al. 2008). A\nfit with R fixed at unity resulted in a \u03c72 (\u03bd) similar\nto that obtained with R left free to vary, then we\ndecided to use R\u22611 in the following fits. The addition of a reflection component in the NP(WP)\nmodel caused \u03c72 to decrease by 9(6), see model\nrefl-NP(refl-WP) in Table 2. The photon index\nsteepens to \u0393 \u22481.65 in both absorption scenarios (e.g. Fig. 2 (left panel) for the iso-\u03c72 contour plot of NH versus \u0393 for the refl-NP model).\n\nIt is worth noting that a fitting model with an\nabsorber completely covering the nucleus plus an\nextra-continuum X-ray emission component (like\nboth NP and WP model) is numerically equivalent\nto a model with a partially-covering absorber. In\nthe partial covering scenario the soft X-ray emission is alternatively interpreted as a portion of\nprimary radiation leaking through the absorber\nwith a covering fraction equal to Cf = (1 \u2212 fs );\nsee Table 2. Instead, in case of fully-covering absorber, the soft excess is explained in terms of\nemission due to reprocessing of the nuclear continuum by surrounding material. This reprocessed\ncomponent may be electron-scattered emission by\nhighly ionized matter extending above the \"hole\"\nof the torus or Compton reflected by cold material, and/or it may arise from large-scale (\u223c0.1-1\nkpc; see Bianchi et al. (2006, 2007a)) photoionized\ngas as pointed out in most of high-resolution soft\nX-ray spectra of heavily-obscured Type 2 AGNs\nwhich are dominated by a wealth of strong emission lines from hydrogen- and helium-like ions of\nthe most abundant metals, from carbon to sulfur\n(Guainazzi & Bianchi 2007; Kinkhabwala et al.\n7\n\n\fTable 2\nBest Fit Continuum Parameters\nModel\n\nModel Name\n\nModel Parameters\n\n\u03c72 /d.o.f.\n\nAPL (neutral absorber) +\nPL\n\nNP\n\nNH = (1.86 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d71022 cm\u22122 ; fs = 0.13\u00b1 0.02\n\u0393 = 1.51 \u00b1 0.06\n\n321/323\n\nAPL (warm absorber) +\nPL\n\nWP\n\n22 cm\u22122 ; f = 0.10\u00b1 0.04\nNH = (2.40 +0.15\ns\n\u22120.18 ) \u00d710\nlog(\u03be) = 1.20\u00b10.11 erg cm s\u22121 ; \u0393 = 1.48\u00b10.05\n\n313/322\n\nNP + Compton\nReflection (neutral)\n(Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995)\n\nrefl-NP\n\nNH = (1.94 \u00b1 0.15) \u00d71022 cm\u22122 ; fs = 0.11\u00b10.01\n\u0393 = 1.67\u00b10.06\nR = \u03a9/2\u03c0 \u2261 1\n\n312/323\n\nWP + Compton\nReflection (neutral)\n(Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995)\n\nrefl-WP\n\nNH = (2.45 \u00b1 0.15)\u00d71022 cm\u22122 ; fs = 0.09\u00b10.03\n\u22121 ; \u0393 = 1.64 +0.06\nlog(\u03be) = 1.16 +0.11\n\u22120.16 erg cm s\n\u22120.08\nR = \u03a9/2\u03c0 \u2261 1\n\n307/322\n\nIonized absorber/emitter + PL +\nCompton Reflection (neutral)\n(Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995)\n\nrefl-wabs\n\nNH = (1.26 \u00b1 0.11)\u00d71022 cm\u22122 ; fs = 0.07 \u00b1 0.02\n\u22121 ; \u0393 = 1.52 \u00b1 0.03\nlog(\u03be) = 0.79 +0.18\n\u22120.11 erg cm s\nAFe \u2261 3; R = \u03a9/2\u03c0 \u2261 1\n\n309/321\n\nrefl-NP + thermal\nemission (Kaastra et al. 1996)\n\nth-NP\n\nNH = (8.50 \u00b1 0.17)\u00d71022 cm\u22122 ; fs = 0.11 \u00b10.01\n\u0393 = 1.64 \u00b1 0.06; R = \u03a9/2\u03c0 \u2261 1\nkTa <0.13 keV\n\n303/321\n\nNote.-APL: absorbed power law.

This model is self-consistent as it also incorporates fluorescent emission lines from ionized\nspecies. Accordingly we removed from the fitting\nmodel the Gaussian line used in all the previous\nfits to describe the line-like feature around 6.4 keV\n(quasar-frame). The best-fit values of the ionization parameter of the reflector were found to be\nconsistent with the minimum permitted value of\n\u03beref l = 30 erg cm s\u22121 (with an upper limit of \u03beref l\n\u22121\n2\n<\n\u223c 40 erg cm s ), which yielded \u03c7\u03bd /dof values\nslightly worse than those with the pexrav component. This clearly indicates that the reflection\nmedium is almost neutral. Using the formula (1)\nreported in Brenneman et al. (2009), we were able\nto provide an estimate of the reflection fraction R.\nRegardless the physical state of the absorber, we\nmeasured an R value of \u22480.6, that supports a scenario in which the hard X-ray spectrum of FTM\n0830+3759 is not largely reflection-dominated.\nFurthermore, we examined the intriguing possibility that the soft-excess could instead be the\nresult of a combination of scattered continuum\nand multiple emission lines arising from the same\nmildly ionized gas responsible of the absorption\n(e.g., Pounds et al. 2005; McKernan et al. 2007;\nLonginotti et al. 2008). To model this soft X-ray\nemitter we again used the XSTAR output table\ngrid 18, with the ionization parameter \u03be and the\ncolumn density of the emitter tied to the values\nof the absorber. We also added to this model a\nneutral reflection component with R fixed to 1.\nThis model (e.g. refl-wabs in Table 2) gave a very\ngood fit to the EPIC data with \u03c72 /dof = 309/321\nwhen the iron abundance was fixed to AFe \u22613 (i.e.\nits best-fit value) for the warm gas. We deduced a\nlow ionization parameter of \u03be \u2248 6 erg cm s\u22121 and a\ncolumn density of NH \u2248 1022 cm\u22122 for the absorbing/emitting gas. The photon index of the power\nlaw resulted \u0393 = 1.52\u00b10.03, i.e. flatter than that\nmeasured with the refl-WP model (\u0393 \u22481.65).\nFinally, we considered a model where a thermal\nplasma component (mekal in XSPEC) is responsible for a fraction of the soft X-ray positive excess\nshown in Fig. 1 (left panel), under the hypothesis\nof an origin from starburst activity. We there-\n\nfore included a mekal component (Kaastra et al.\n1996) with solar abundance in the refl-NP model.\nThe resulting \u03c72 /dof was excellent with 303/321,\nsignificant at 99.1% confidence in an F \u2212test (e.g.\nmodel th-NP in Table 2). However, the best-fit\ntemperature of the emitting plasma was pegged\nat the minimum value allowed of kT \u2248 0.08 keV\nwith an upper limit of 0.13 keV. It is also important to note that the derived 0.5-2 keV luminosity\nof 2.1 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 for this thermal component\neven exceeds the highest values measured for starburst regions in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies\n(e.g., Franceschini et al. 2003).\n4.3.\n\nThe Iron K\u03b1 emission line\n\nThe presence of an excess around 6.4 keV (restframe) in the XMM\u2013Newton spectrum of FTM\n0830+3759 is clearly evident. Fig. 2 (right panel)\nshows the data/model ratio in the observer Fe K\nemission line energy range when fitting the refl-NP\nmodel over 0.3-9 keV and ignoring the 3.8-5.2 keV\nband.\nWe have modeled this spectral feature with a\nnarrow Gaussian line. The inclusion of this component in the fit resulted in very significant statistical improvement (\u2206\u03c72 = 13 for two additional\nfree parameters), i.e. at 99.99% confidence level\naccording to an F \u2013test once compared to a model\nwithout the line. We concentrated only on PN\ndata for a more accurate determination of the Fe\nK\u03b1 line parameters since the PN CCD has a better sensitivity and energy resolution over the 4-6\nkeV energy range than the MOS CCD. The restframe energy centroid of the line is E = 6.42+0.04\n\u22120.06\nkeV. This energy indicates a low ionization state,\nFe I\u2013XVIII, of the emitting material. Allowing\nthe width of the line in FTM 0830+3759 to vary\ndid not improve the fit over a narrow-line model\n<\n(\u03c3 \u223c\n0.18 keV). We measured a redshift-corrected\nequivalent width EW = 168\u00b160 eV assuming that\nthe line and continuum are both absorbed, while\nthe EW calculated with respect to the reflected\ncontinuum is EW = 800\u00b1280 eV.\n4.4.\n\nX-ray Fluxes and Luminosities of\nFTM 0830+3759\n\nOnce model refl-NP was assumed, we measured\nan observed(intrinsic) 2-10 keV flux of 8.9(9.4) \u00d7\n10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and a 0.5-2 keV flux of 1.3(4.1)\n\n9\n\n\f2.2\n2\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nNH (1022 cm\u22122)\n\n1.7\nPhoton Index\n\n1.8\n\n1.5\n1\n\nratio\n\n2\n\n1.6\n\n4\n\n4.5\nchannel energy (keV)\n\n5\n\nFig. 2.- Left: Confidence contour plot showing the column density (in units of 1022 cm\u22122 ) of the cold\nabsorber against the photon index of the power-law continuum obtained by applying model refl-NP (e.g.\nTable 2, Sect. 4.2). The contours are at 68%, 90%, and 99% confidence levels for two interesting parameters,\nrespectively. Right: Close-up of the EPIC PN data/model ratio residuals in the Fe K\u03b1 emission line energy\nrange (observer-frame) when fitting the refl-NP model over 0.3-9 keV and ignoring the 3.8-5.2 keV band.\nThe vertical dashed line represents the energy of 6.4 keV in the quasar rest-frame.\n\n10\n\n\fdescription with a final \u03c72 /dof=38/36. We measured a power-law photon index of \u0393 = 1.65\u00b10.25,\ni.e. significantly flatter than that reported by\nU05 and consistent with that obtained from the\nXMM\u2013Newton observation. An alternative fit\nwith a warm absorber was slightly worse, yielding\n\u03c72 /dof = 42/36 (NH \u2248 2.5\u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 and ionization parameter \u03be \u2248 23 erg cm s\u22121 ). The application of a model in which the ionized gas covers only\npartially the X-ray source did not improve the fit\nsignificantly (\u2206\u03c72 = 5 for one additional parameter) and resulted in best-fit ionization parameter\n\u03be consistent with the minimum allowed value of\n10\u22124 erg cm s\u22121 . We therefore consider the cold\nabsorber model as the most appropriate description of the Chandra spectrum of FTM 0830+3759.\nThe data/model residuals for this model suggested a possible unmodelled absorption feature at\n1.52 keV (i.e. 2.15 keV in the quasar rest-frame).\nThe addition of an absorption Gaussian line in\nthe fit resulted significant at 93% confidence level.\nWe also checked the possibility that this line at\n2.15\u00b10.07 keV (EW=65\u00b144 eV) could be an artifact owing to a bad background subtraction. In\nparticular, two well-known emission lines from Al\nK\u03b1 and Si K\u03b1 are present in the ACIS background\nspectrum at 1.49 and 1.74 keV, respectively. However, the background spectrum does not show\nany spectral feature and its intensity is an order of magnitude fainter than the backgroundsubtracted signal from FTM 0830+3759, e.g.\nFig. 3. The presence of the absorption line at\n\u223c2.15 keV is very puzzling as this energy does\nnot correspond to any obvious line of appreciable\nstrength. It can be associated to Si XIII-XV transitions but, in this case, much more prominent\nfeatures from more abundant, lighter elements are\nexpected, which are instead not observed. On\nthe basis of these arguments and the low statistical significance of this line, the presence of this\nfeature will be ignored in the following discussion.\nFurthermore a small positive excess was seen\naround 4.5 keV (i.e. \u223c6.4 keV rest-frame). The\ninclusion of a narrow Gaussian emission line in\nthe NP model produced a statistical improvement\nof \u2206\u03c72 = 3 for two additional parameters, corresponding to an F-statistics probability of \u223c90%.\nWe measured the centroid of the line at 6.17+0.11\n\u22120.17\nkeV and an EW value of 232\u00b1175 eV. Even if the\nenergy of this line is not fully consistent with 6.4\n\n\u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . After correction for both\nGalactic and intrinsic absorption, the luminosity\nof FTM 0830+3759 are L2\u221210keV = 4.8 \u00d7 1044\nand L0.5\u22122keV = 2.3 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 in the hard\nand soft band, respectively. The average bolometric corrections measured for radio-quiet AGNs\nwith similar L2\u221210keV from Vasudevan & Fabian\n(2007) are in the range 20\u201340, that imply a bolometric luminosity of \u2248 0.97\u20131.94 \u00d7 1046 erg s\u22121\nfor FTM 0830+3759.\n5.\n5.1.\n\nChandra Observation\nData Reduction\n\nU05 presented the results of a Chandra ACIS-S\nsnapshot survey of broad line red quasars aimed\nat measuring the gas-to-dust ratios of the medium\nobscuring the nucleus. FTM 0830+3759, the\nbrightest object in this sample, was observed by\nChandra for \u22489 ks in January 2004.\nEvent files of the Chandra observation were\nretrieved from the Chandra X-ray Center. The\ndata reduction was performed with the CIAO v4.1\npackage following the standard procedures outlined in the Science Analysis Threads for ACIS\ndata at the CIAO Web site. Source and background spectra were produced using the psextract2\nscript. For the creation of the response matrices\nwith the newest calibrations available we used the\nmkacisrmf task. The ACIS source spectrum in the\n0.3-7 keV band was grouped to a minimum of 20\ncounts per bin (see Fig. 3).\n5.2.\n\nSpectral Analysis\n\nU05 fitted the spectrum of this quasar with\nan absorbed, steep power-law (\u0393 \u223c 2.9; NH \u223c\n2.7 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 ) plus a broad (\u03c3 \u223c 0.6 keV)\nGaussian emission line at 6.4 keV. However, they\nalso reported the presence of evident unfitted absorption/emission features. We have therefore reanalyzed those data in order to provide a better characterization of the X-ray spectrum of this\npowerful quasar. Our analysis of the Chandra data\nof FTM 0830+3759 resulted quite different from\nthat published by U05. A fitting model similar to\nthe NP model described in Sect. 4.2 with NH \u2248 2.1\n\u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 and fs \u2248 0.07 provided a very good\n2 http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/psextract/\n\n11\n\n\fkeV, an explanation in terms of Fe K\u03b1 emission is\nvery likely.\nFinally, from this Chandra observation we derived a 2-10(0.5-2) keV flux of 1.3(0.2) \u00d7 10\u221212 erg\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 , corresponding to a luminosity of 8(4.3)\n\u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 .\n6.\n\nBroad-Band Spectral\nFTM 0830+3759\n\nProperties\n\nSect. 7.2). Steep \u03b1ox values can also explained\nin terms of high Eddington ratios (Lbol /LEdd )\nas proposed by Kuraszkiewicz et al. (2009b) on\nthe basis of the predictions from the accretion\ndisk/corona model of Witt et al. (1997). According to these authors high values of the accretion\nrate should lead to an increase of the ratio between\nbig blue bump and X-ray emission. In this respect,\nobservational evidence supporting the existence of\na correlation between \u03b1ox and Lbol /LEdd comes\nfrom recent works based on large samples of AGNs\n(Young et al. 2009; Lusso et al. 2009). This may\nbolster the hypothesis of FTM 0830+3759 being a BAL quasar since high Lbol /LEdd values\nare typical of Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies and\nBAL quasars, but both optical (i.e. emission line\n>\nwidths \u223c\n1000 km s\u22121 ) and X-ray spectral properties (i.e. relatively flat power-law photon index\n\u0393 \u2248 1.65) of FTM 0830+3759 are not consistent\nwith those of a Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy (e.g.,\nLeighly 1999, and references therein).\n\nof\n\nA widely adopted way to evaluate the broadband properties of AGN consists in estimating\nthe optical UV-to-X-ray power-law slope \u03b1ox 3 and\ncomparing it with the values obtained from large\nsamples of optically selected broad-line quasars\n(e.g., Vignali et al. 2003b; Strateva et al. 2005;\nSteffen et al. 2006). Unlike blue broad-line AGNs,\nwhich are usually characterized by low extinction, the optical/UV spectral properties of our\ntarget are consistent with heavy extinction (U05;\nUrrutia et al. 2008).\nTo obtain an \"intrinsic\" value for \u03b1ox , we\napplied a correction to the observed rest-frame\n2500 \u00c5 and 2 keV flux densities. In the UV band,\nto derive the luminosity at 2500 \u00c5, we used the\nmagnitudes from the SDSS and adopted a procedure as described in Vignali et al. (2003b). Then\nwe assumed the nuclear extinction estimated by\nUrrutia et al. (2008) using HST data, i.e. E(B\u2212V)\n= 1.29\u00b10.12, coupled with an SMC extinction\ncurve with RV = 3.1 as in Urrutia et al. (2008)\nto correct the L(2500 \u00c5). In the X-rays, the correction for obscuration has been obtained directly\nfrom the best-fitting column density value (see\nSect. 4.4). The resulting \u03b1ox is \u2248 \u22122.3; at face\nvalue, this value is significantly steeper than that\nexpected using the \u03b1ox vs. L(2500 \u00c5) correlation (e.g. Eq. (2) in Steffen et al. (2006); see\nalso Just et al. (2007)). Such extreme values are\nmore typical of the X-ray weak quasar population\n(Brandt et al. 2000), which is largely dominated\nby Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasars (e.g.\nWeymann et al. 1991). Unfortunately, given the\nsource redshift current optical spectral data are\nnot able to provide a direct observational evidence\nfor a possible BAL nature of FTM 0830+3759 (e.g.\n3\n\n\u03b1ox =\n\nlog(f2 keV /f\n)\n2500 \u00c5\n,\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe combination of X-ray brightness and a net\nexposure of \u223c40 ks makes the XMM\u2013Newton spectrum of FTM 0830+3759 one of the best exposed\nand most detailed X-ray spectra of a red (i.e. with\nJ \u2212 Ks >1.7 and R \u2212 Ks >4.0) broad-line quasar\nto date. This observation has definitely confirmed\nthe complexity of the X-ray spectrum of this luminous quasar. In particular, our analysis has\nrevealed (i) the presence of a heavy absorption\nwith NH \u22481022 cm\u22122 along the line of sight to\nthe nucleus and (ii) the significant detection of a\nCompton reflection component accompanied by a\nclear-cut Fe K\u03b1 emission line in this AGN with\nL2\u221210keV \u2248 5 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 .\nThe results from re-analysis of the Chandra data taken in 2004 are consistent with those\nderived from the XMM\u2013Newton observation. One\nimmediate conclusion that can be drawn from\nthese findings is that the X-ray spectrum of\nFTM 0830+3759 significantly differs from that\ntypically observed for optically-selected, broadline quasars with comparable 2-10 keV luminosity (Piconcelli et al. 2005; George et al. 2000;\nJust et al. 2007).\n\nand f2500 \u00c5 are\nthe rest-frame flux densities at 2 keV and 2500 \u00c5, respectively (e.g. Avni et al. 1980; Zamorani et al. 1981)\nlog(\u03bd2 keV /\u03bd\n)\n2500 \u00c5\n\nwhere f2\n\n7.\n\nkeV\n\n12\n\n\f0.01\n10\u22123\n10\u22124\n\nnormalized counts s\u22121 keV\u22121\n\n1\n\n2\nchannel energy (keV)\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.- The 9 ks Chandra ACIS-S spectrum of FTM 0830+3759 (top) compared with the spectrum of\nthe background (bottom). Over the Chandra bandpass, the intensity of the source is more than an order of\nmagnitude higher than background.\n\n7.1.\n\n2005). The value of NH \u223c2 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 measured\nfor FTM 0830+3759 (e.g. model refl-NP in Table\n2) is consistent with the distribution of the column\ndensity peaking around a few \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 observed for the samples of red 2MASS quasars.\nUsing a reddening of E(B-V)=1.29\u00b10.12 mag\n(AV \u22484 mag) from Urrutia et al. (2008) and assuming for the dust:gas ratio the average Galactic\nvalue of 1.7 mag cm2 /atoms (Bohlin et al. 1978)\nwe derived a NH value of 7.5\u00b10.7 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 ,\nwhich is only a factor of \u22482.6 lower than the\nNH measured from our XMM\u2013Newton observation.\nThis is interesting since Maiolino et al. (2001)\nfound that only low-luminosity (i.e. L2\u221210keV <1042\nerg s\u22121 ) AGNs usually show a E(B-V)/NH ratio\nroughly consistent with the Galactic one, while\nFTM 0830+3759 is a very luminous quasar with\nL2\u221210keV \u2248 5 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . The match between the column density measured via X-ray\nspectroscopy and that expected on the basis of\nreddening E(B-V) due to the dust suggests the\nlikely possibility that the same material is responsible for the obscuration both in optical and\nX-rays. Similar findings have been reported by\nKuraszkiewicz et al. (2009a) by an extensive study\nof the SED of 44 red, 2MASS-selected AGNs\nat low z. They found a substantial agreement\namong the column densities inferred from the Xray spectral fitting and those derived from op-\n\nThe nature of the X-ray absorber\n\nThe present X-ray observation is not able to\nprovide unambiguous information about the location and the physical state of the absorber.\nIn fact, both a model with neutral and mildlyionized obscuring material provide an excellent\nfit to the EPIC data (see Table 2). Unfortunately, no meaningful RGS data were collected for\nFTM 0830+3759 during this XMM\u2013Newton observation.\nIn this Section, we discuss possible scenarios\nfor the nature of the X-ray absorber in FTM\n0830+3759. A direct statistical comparison between model NP and model WP favors the warm\nabsorption scenario at 99.6% confidence level using the F \u2212test. Nonetheless, when a Compton reflection component with R=1 is added to the NP\nmodel, the fit involving an ionized absorber is no\nlonger statistically preferable to a model with cold\nabsorption (i.e. model refl-NP) as the difference in\nterms of \u2206\u03c72 =1 for 1 dof is significant at only 70%\nconfidence level according to the F \u2212test.\n7.1.1.\n\nCold Absorption Scenario\n\nWilkes et al. (2002, 2005) and U05 have indeed\nreported the common presence of cold absorption in the X-ray spectra of broad-line red quasars\nunlike optically-selected objects (Piconcelli et al.\n13\n\n\ftical/IR colors once a very detailed modeling\nof the optical colors is performed (i.e. including the combined effects due to reddening and\nthe contributions from the AGN scattered unreddened light and the host galaxy emission). Using Principal Component Analysis of the SED\nand emission-line parameters for the same sample, Kuraszkiewicz et al. (2009b) argue that the\noptical/X-ray absorber may lie far from the nucleus, and presumably outside the NLR. The interstellar medium of the host galaxy with a dust:gas\nratio being comparable with Galactic dust might\nrepresent a good candidate for this obscuration\n(Weingartner & Murray 2002; Dai & Kochanek\n2009). In particular, Kuraszkiewicz et al. (2009b)\nproposed that obscuration possibly occurs in the\nISM of a host galaxy inclined to our line of sight\n(LOS), although obscuration by circumnuclear\ndust is also important.\nAs described in Sect. 4.2, our spectral analysis results are also consistent with a scenario\nwherein the absorber only partially covers the Xray emitting region. This implies two distinct LOS\nand that the obscuring screen along our LOS is\nnot uniform, being spatially located in the nuclear region. The obscuring material must indeed be close to the continuum source for partial covering to work. A clumpy (sub-)pc-scale\ntorus as that proposed by Risaliti et al. (2005)\nand Elitzur (2008, and references therein) can\neasily satisfy both these conditions. The short\ntime-scales (i.e. few hours) temporal variability\nof the absorbing column density observed in some\nSeyfert 2 galaxies strongly supports this interpretation, for which the obscuring matter is not continuously distributed and doughnut-shaped (e.g.\nPier & Krolik 1993; Granato & Danese 1994) but\nconsists of a number of clouds distributed in order\nthat the probability for direct viewing the AGN increases away from the equatorial plane. Broad-line\nemitting clouds lying inside the dust sublimation\nradius (Rd ) are dust-free and extinguish only Xrays, while clouds being farther than Rd are dusty\nand absorb the AGN light both at X-rays and optical wavelength.\nHowever, both the non-variability of the NH over\nthe XMM\u2013Newton exposure time (also compared\nwith the 2004 Chandra observation) and the consistency between the NH values obtained from optical reddening and X-ray analysis suggests that\n\nour LOS mostly intercepts dusty material outside\nthe Rd (i.e. pc- and kpc-scale dust lanes and the\ninterstellar medium in the host galaxy), decreasing the probability it can partially cover the X-ray\nnuclear source in FTM 0830+3759.\n7.1.2.\n\nIonized Absorption Scenario\n\nWe found that a warm absorber model can also\nprovide an excellent description of the X-ray spectrum of FTM 0830+3759. Features from ionized\nabsorbers are detected in the UV and X-ray spectra of over half of AGNs (Crenshaw et al. 1999;\nReynolds 1997; Piconcelli et al. 2005; McKernan et al.\n2007) which are interpreted as the signature of\nan outflowing multi-component wind rising vertically from the accretion disk intercepting our LOS\n(Crenshaw et al. 2003; Krongold et al. 2007, and\nreferences therein). The large deficit below \u223c2\nkeV visible in Fig. 1 (left panel) would be the\nresult of the interplay between large column density and moderate ionization level of the obscuring\ngas. Such a combination of physical parameters of\nthe warm absorber is not commonly observed in\nunreddened Type 1 AGNs (e.g. McKernan et al.\n2007) and it could be responsible for the classification of FTM 0830+3759 as red quasar. However,\nour EPIC data cannot provide the adequate resolution and sensitivity to significantly detect the\nlikely presence of multiple ionization components\nand, therefore, the measured values of NH and \u03be\nmust be considered as average values of these parameters. Recent observations (Steenbrugge et al.\n2009; Krongold et al. 2007) have pinpointed the\ndistance of absorption components of the warm\nabsorber in AGNs at sub-pc scale from the X-ray\nsource. The clumpy and outflowing nature of the\nAGN winds lends support to a partial-covering\nscenario, which is consistent with our spectral\nanalysis results (e.g. Sect. 4.2), with two different LOS, one of which does not pass through the\nwind.\nAs described in Sect. 4.2 we also tested a\nmodel wherein the soft X-ray extra-continuum\ncomponent is explained in terms of a mix of scattered emission and photoionized emission from\nthe moderately-ionized absorber itself (e.g. model\nrefl-wabs in Table 2). We yielded a very good\nfit to the XMM\u2013Newton spectral data with \u03be\u22486\nerg cm s\u22121 and a column density of NH \u2248 1.3\n\u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 for the obscuring gas. These val14\n\n\fues indicate a low ionization state of the absorber that significantly reduces the primary\nAGN emission in the soft X-ray portion of the\nspectrum and, in turn, could unveil weak emission components which are usually overwhelmed\nby the continuum in normal broad-line AGNs.\nInterestingly, a similar scenario was also suggested to explain the soft-excess emission in the\nred quasars 2MASS 23449+1221 (Pounds et al.\n2005), 2MASS 1049+5837 (Wilkes et al. 2008)\nand 2MASS 0918+2117 (Pounds & Wilkes 2007),\nand, furthermore, for the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mkn 335\nduring a very low continuum state (Longinotti et al.\n2008).\n\ntion and co-evolution of quasars and their massive spheroidal host galaxies (Hopkins et al. 2006;\nDi Matteo et al. 2005; Silk & Rees 1998). Evidence for a large fraction of mergers and ongoing galaxy interactions, that are believed to be\nthe trigger of both starburst and AGN activity at\nthe very initial stages of galaxy/AGN co-evolution\nhas been indeed observed amongst host galaxies of\nFTM luminous quasars by Urrutia et al. (2008).\nGeorgakakis et al. (2009) have recently discovered\nthat the level of star-formation activity in the\nluminous, high-z, red quasars is higher than in\noptically-selected objects. This provides further\nclues to an evolutionary scenario where red quasars\nare young, dust-embedded objects in which the\nAGN driven feedback processes have not yet completely inhibited the star-formation in their host\ngalaxies. As described in Sect. 6, the steep \u03b1ox\nvalue (\u03b1ox = \u22122.3) reported for FTM 0830+3759\nis favorably compatible with the observed broadband properties of BAL quasars and, furthermore,\nthe complex, absorption-dominated spectrum of\nFTM 0830+3759 resembles the typical X-ray spectrum of a BAL quasar (e.g. Gallagher et al. 2002;\nSchartel et al. 2005). Unfortunately the redshift\nof FTM 0830+3759 is not in the range suited\nto provide a direct BAL classification for this\nquasar by a ESI/Keck spectrum as pointed out by\nUrrutia et al. (2009). Future observations will be\nable to detect the possible absorption troughs in\nthe optical-UV spectrum of this reddened quasar\nin order to shed light on the presence of a strong\noutflowing nuclear wind.\n\nFinally, if a cold absorption component is added\nto the warm absorber fitting models, no improvement in the fit statistic is yielded, with an upper\nlimit of NH <6 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 on its column density, indicating that a scenario with an innermost\nhighly ionized absorber embedded in large-scale\n(i.e. galactic) neutral absorber cannot explain the\nX-ray spectrum of FTM 0830+3759.\n7.2.\n\nFTM 0830+3759 as a possible BAL\nquasar candidate\n\nThe presence of a nuclear outflow in FTM\n0830+3759 can be interesting in the light of the\nresults recently obtained by Urrutia et al. (2009)\nfor a spectroscopic survey of red quasars with selection criteria very similar to those used in the\nFTM survey. For this sample they found a signif> 40%) of BAL quasars\nicantly larger fraction ( \u223c\nat z > 0.9 than that observed in optical surveys\n(Hewett & Foltz 2003). BALs are interpreted as\ndirect evidence of a mass outflow from the AGN\n(Weymann et al. 1991; Elvis 2000; Hasinger et al.\n2002; Young et al. 2007). The frequent detection of BALs in red quasars leads Urrutia et al.\n(2009) to suggest that BAL quasars may represent a peculiar dust-enshrouded phase in the evolution of quasars. The appearance as a BAL\nquasar might indeed be linked to the duty cycle of an accreting supermassive black hole instead of being simply due to an orientation effect\nand the geometry of the outflow. Moreover their\npowerful nuclear winds may be the main mechanism responsible for the AGN-driven feedback\nthought to be relevant for star formation quenching and invoked in many models of joint forma-\n\n7.3.\n\nComparison with the Hard X-ray\nProperties of unreddened Broad-line\nQuasars\n\nOur analysis of the XMM\u2013Newton observation of FTM 0830+3759 has revealed the\npresence of the typical features of a Comptonized reflected spectrum from a neutral material, i.e. an intense fluorescent Fe K\u03b1 emission\nline and a hard X-ray Compton reflection component (George & Fabian 1991; Krolik et al. 1994;\nPerola et al. 2002). Given the paucity of well> 5 \u00d7 1044 erg\nexposed quasars with L2\u221210keV \u223c\n\u22121\ns\ninformation regarding the presence and the\nproperties of reflection features in their hard Xray spectra are still sparse (see also Miniutti et al.\n2009). In particular, since the peak of the Comp15\n\n\fton hump occurs at \u223c30 keV, the sensitivity\nreached by current and past X-ray telescopes observing in this energy band allows to efficiently\nstudy only very few bright sources, which are predominantly local Seyfert galaxies.\nThe line equivalent width measured with respect to the reflected continuum assuming R=1\nis EW \u223c 800 eV, that is consistent with the theoretical prediction of EW \u223c 1000 eV for reflection\nfrom optically thick material with iron solar abundance (e.g. Matt et al. 1996) suggesting an origin\nin the reflecting medium. Bearing in mind the\nuncertainty in the exact value of R, this in turn\nimplies the presence of off-LOS Compton-thick\nmaterial in this quasar that can be likely associated with a pc-scale structure (Jaffe et al. 2004;\nMeisenheimer et al. 2007) as the putative torus\nenvisaged by the AGN Unified Model (Antonucci\n1993). On the other hand, the value of the EW\ncalculated with respect to the unabsorbed primary\ncontinuum is \u223c160 eV, that is significantly higher\nthan the predicted EW from a uniform shell of\nmaterial with a column density of NH \u223c 2 \u00d7 1022\ncm\u22122 encompassing the continuum source, i.e.\nEW < 40 eV (Guainazzi et al. 2005; Matt 2002).\nUnreddened broad-lined quasars at the same hard\nX-ray luminosity level of FTM 0830+3759 typically show an Fe K\u03b1 line with an hEWi in the\nrange from 40 eV (Bianchi et al. 2007b) to 70 eV\n(Jimenez-Bailon et al. 2005). The large EW value\nreported for FTM 0830+3759 can be explained\nwith a large covering fraction of the Fe-emitting\nmaterial in this red quasar or, alternatively, it\ncould be associated to a low-flux state of the central source, with the distant reflector still responding to an average higher luminosity.\nFinally, once a reflection continuum is included\nin the fitting model, the slope of the powerlaw continuum measured for FTM 0830+3759 (\u0393\n\u22481.65) is still slightly flatter than the canonical\nspectral index measured for classical radio-quiet\nquasars, i.e 1.8\u20131.9 (Just et al. 2007; Piconcelli et al.\n2005). A low-flux state can also be invoked for interpreting the observed slope (Grupe et al. 2008).\nFurthermore, the value of \u0393 \u22481.65 is at odds with\nthe claim of U05 that red quasars show an average\nsteep photon index of h\u0393i=2.1\u20132.2. However such\nconclusion is based on values of \u0393 inferred from\nlow-count spectra or hardness-ratio analysis and\ntherefore affected by large uncertainties: deeper\n\nX-ray follow-up observations of these red quasars\nindeed found spectral index values consistent with\nthose typical of optically-selected quasars (e.g.,\nWilkes et al. 2005; Pounds et al. 2005).\n\nWe thank the anonymous referee for valuable feedback.
