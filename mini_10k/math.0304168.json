A vanishing theorem is proved for Ext groups over\nnon-commutative graded algebras. Along the way, an \"infinite\"\nversion is proved of the non-commutative Auslander-Buchsbaum\ntheorem.\n\n0. Introduction\nLet R be a noetherian local commutative ring, and let X be a finitely\ngenerated R-module of finite projective dimension. The classical Auslander-Buchsbaum theorem states\npd X = depth R \u2212 depth X.\nThis can also be phrased as an Ext vanishing theorem, namely, if M is\nany R-module, then\nExtiR (X, M) = 0 for i > depth R \u2212 depth X.\n\n(1)\n\nIn [1] is proved a surprising variation of this: Suppose that R is\ncomplete in the m-adic topology. Then equation (1) remains true if X\nis any R-module of finite projective dimension, provided M is finitely\ngenerated. In other words, the condition of being finitely generated is\nshifted from X to M.\nIn theorem 2.4 below, this result will be generalized to the situation\nof a non-commutative noetherian N-graded connected algebra.\nThe route goes through an \"infinite\" version of the non-commutative\nAuslander-Buchsbaum theorem, given in theorem 1.4. This result is a\nsubstantial improvement of the original non-commutative AuslanderBuchsbaum theorem, as given in [3, thm. 3.2], in that the condition of\ndealing only with finitely generated modules is dropped.\nThe notation of this paper is standard, and is already on record in\nseveral places such as [2] or [3]. So I will not say much, except that\nthroughout, k is a field, and A is a noetherian N-graded connected\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 16E30, 16W50.\nKey words and phrases. k-flat dimension, depth, infinite non-commutative Auslander-Buchsbaum theorem, Ext groups, vanishing theorem.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPETER J\u00d8RGENSEN\n\nk-algebra. However, let me give one important word of caution: Everything in sight is graded. So for instance, D(A) stands for D(Gr A),\nthe derived category of the abelian category Gr(A) of Z-graded A-leftmodules and graded homomorphisms of degree zero.\n1. Auslander-Buchsbaum\nDefinition 1.1. For X in D(A), define the k-flat dimension by\nL\n\nk.fd X = \u2212 inf k \u2297A X.\nRemark 1.2. Using a minimal free resolution, it is easy to see that if\nthe cohomology of X is bounded and finitely generated, then\nk.fd X = fd X = pd X,\nwhere fd stands for flat dimension and pd stands for projective dimension.\nIn the following lemma is used Db (A), the full subcategory of D(A)\nconsisting of complexes with bounded cohomology, and D+ (Aop ), the\nfull subcategory of D(Aop ) consisting of complexes with cohomology\nvanishing in low degrees.\nLemma 1.3. Let X in Db (A) have fd X < \u221e, and let S in D+ (Aop )\nhave dimk hi (S) < \u221e for each i. Then\nL\n\ninf S \u2297A X = inf S \u2212 k.fd X.\nProof. Observe that fd X < \u221e implies\nL\n\ninf k \u2297A X > \u2212\u221e,\nhence\nk.fd X < \u221e.\n\n(2)\n\ninf S = \u221e\n\n(3)\n\nIf\nL\n\nthen S is zero. Then S \u2297A X is also zero, so\nL\n\ninf S \u2297A X = \u221e.\n\n(4)\n\nCombining equations (2), (3), and (4) shows that for inf S = \u221e, the\nlemma's equation reads\n\u221e = \u221e \u2212 (something smaller than \u221e)\nwhich is true.\n\n\fEXT VANISHING\n\n3\n\nSo for the rest of the proof, I can assume inf S < \u221e, that is, S is\nnon-zero. Note that S is in D+ (Aop ), so inf S > \u2212\u221e, so inf S is a\nfinite number.\nLet me first do the case where S is concentrated in degree zero. Here\nS is just a graded A-right-module which is finite dimensional over k,\nand the lemma claims\nL\n\nL\n\ninf S \u2297A X = \u2212 k.fd X = inf k \u2297A X.\n\n(5)\n\nTo prove this, note that dimk S < \u221e gives that there is a short exact\nsequence 0 \u2192 k(l) \u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2192 S\u0303 \u2192 0 of graded A-right-modules. This\ngives a distinguished triangle k(l) \u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2192 S\u0303 \u2212\u2192 in D(Aop ), and\ntensoring with X and taking the cohomology long exact sequence gives\na sequence consisting of pieces\nL\n\nL\n\nL\n\nhi (k(l) \u2297A X) \u2212\u2192 hi (S \u2297A X) \u2212\u2192 hi (S\u0303 \u2297A X).\nInduction on dimk S now shows that the lowest i with\nL\n\nhi (k \u2297A X) 6= 0\nequals the lowest i with\nL\n\nhi (S \u2297A X) 6= 0,\nL\n\nand equation (5) follows. The induction works because inf k \u2297A X >\nL\n\n\u2212\u221e, and even works for inf k \u2297A X = \u221e.\nLet me next do the case where S is general. There is a standard\nspectral sequence\nL\n\nL\n\nE2pq = hp (hq (S) \u2297A X) \u21d2 hp+q (S \u2297A X).\nSince fd X < \u221e, the spectral sequence is first quadrant up to shift,\nhence converges. Now, dimk hq (S) < \u221e holds for each q, so if hq (S) is\nnon-zero, then the special case of the lemma dealt with above applies\nL\n\nto hq (S) \u2297A X and shows\nL\n\ninf hq (S) \u2297A X = \u2212 k.fd X.\n\n(6)\n\nThere are now two cases: First, if\nk.fd X = \u2212\u221e\n\n(7)\nL\n\nthen equation (6) gives that if hq (S) is non-zero, then inf hq (S) \u2297A\nL\n\nX = \u221e, that is, hp (hq (S) \u2297A X) is zero for each p. Of course this\nalso holds for hq (S) equal to zero, and so in the spectral sequence, E2pq\n\n\f4\n\nPETER J\u00d8RGENSEN\nL\n\nis identically zero. Therefore the limit hp+q (S \u2297A X) of the spectral\nL\n\nsequence is also zero, so S \u2297A X is zero, so\nL\n\ninf S \u2297A X = \u221e.\n\n(8)\n\nBut inf S is a finite number, and combining this with equations (7)\nand (8) says that the lemma's equation reads\n\u221e = (a finite number) \u2212 (\u2212\u221e)\nwhich is true.\nSecondly, if\nk.fd X > \u2212\u221e,\nL\n\nthen equation (6) says that if hq (S) is non-zero, then hp (hq (S) \u2297A\nM) is non-zero for p = \u2212 k.fd X, but zero for p < \u2212 k.fd X. And\nL\n\nof course, if hq (S) is zero, then hp (hq (S) \u2297A X) is zero for each p.\nSo in the spectral sequence, E2pq is non-zero for p = \u2212 k.fd X and\nq = inf S, but zero for lower p or q. Hence E2\u2212 k.fd X,inf S can be used\nin a standard corner argument which shows that the lowest non-zero\nL\n\nterm in the limit hp+q (S \u2297A X) of the spectral sequence has degree\np + q = \u2212 k.fd X + inf S. Hence\nL\n\ninf S \u2297A X = \u2212 k.fd X + inf S,\nproving the lemma's equation.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 1.4 (Infinite Auslander-Buchsbaum). Assume that A satisfies dimk ExtiA (k, A) < \u221e for each i. Let X in Db (A) have fd X < \u221e.\nThen\ndepth X = depth A \u2212 k.fd X.\nProof. I have\nL\n\nL\n\nRHomA (k, X) \u223c\n= RHomA (k, A \u2297A X) \u223c\n= RHomA (k, A) \u2297A X,\nwhere the second \u223c\n= holds because it holds if X is just a graded flat\nmodule, so also holds if X is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex\nof graded flat modules, and this is the case since X is in Db (A) and\nhas fd X < \u221e.\n\n\fEXT VANISHING\n\n5\n\nThus\ndepth X = inf RHomA (k, X)\nL\n\n= inf RHomA (k, A) \u2297A X\n(a)\n\n= inf RHomA (k, A) \u2212 k.fd X\n= depth A \u2212 k.fd X,\n\nwhere (a) is by lemma 1.3. The lemma applies because RHomA (k, A)\nis in D+ (Aop ), and has dimk hi RHomA (k, A) = dimk ExtiA (k, A) < \u221e\nfor each i by assumption.\n\u0003\nRemark 1.5. Theorem 1.4 even holds for depth A = \u221e, where the\ntheorem states depth X = \u221e.\nOn the other hand, suppose depth A < \u221e. Then it is easy to see\nthat it makes sense to rearrange the equation in theorem 1.4 as\nk.fd X = depth A \u2212 depth X.\nIf the cohomology of X is bounded and finitely generated, then this\nequation reads\npd X = depth A \u2212 depth X\nby remark 1.2. This is the original non-commutative Auslander-Buchsbaum theorem, as proved in [3, thm. 3.2].\n2. Ext vanishing\nLemma 2.1. Let X in Db (A) have fd X < \u221e, and let T in D+ (Aop )\nbe so that hi (T ) is a graded torsion module for each i. Then\nL\n\ninf T \u2297A X \u2265 inf T \u2212 k.fd X.\nProof. As in the proof of lemma 1.3, it is easy to see that for inf T = \u221e,\nthe lemma's inequality trivially reads \u221e \u2265 \u221e. So for the rest of\nthe proof I can assume inf T < \u221e. Note that T is in D+ (Aop ), so\ninf T > \u2212\u221e, so inf T is a finite number.\nLet me first do the case where T is concentrated in degree zero. Here\nT is just a graded torsion module, and the lemma claims\nL\n\nL\n\ninf T \u2297A X \u2265 \u2212 k.fd X = inf k \u2297A X.\nIf F is a flat resolution of X, then this amounts to\ninf T \u2297A F \u2265 inf k \u2297A F.\n\n(9)\n\nTo prove this, note that as T is a graded torsion module, it is the\ncolimit of the system\nT h1i \u2286 T h2i \u2286 * * *\n\n\f6\n\nPETER J\u00d8RGENSEN\n\nwhere\nT hji = { t \u2208 T | A\u2265j t = 0 }.\nEach\nquotient T hji/T hj \u2212 1i is annihilated by A\u22651 so has the form\n`\nk(l\n\u03b1 ), so there are short exact sequences of the form\n\u03b1\na\n0 \u2192 T hj \u2212 1i \u2212\u2192 T hji \u2212\u2192\nk(l\u03b1 ) \u2192 0.\n\u03b1\n\nTensoring such a sequence with F gives a short exact sequence of complexes because F consists of graded flat modules. The corresponding\ncohomology long exact sequence consists of pieces\na\nhi (T hj \u2212 1i \u2297A F ) \u2212\u2192 hi (T hji \u2297A F ) \u2212\u2192\nhi (k \u2297A F )(l\u03b1 ).\n\u03b1\n\nInduction on j now makes clear that\nhi (k \u2297A F ) = 0\nimplies\nhi (T hji \u2297A F ) = 0 for each j,\nand this further gives\nhi (T \u2297A F ) \u223c\n= colim hi (T hji \u2297A F ) = 0,\n= hi (colim T hji \u2297A F ) \u223c\nso the inequality (9) follows.\nLet me next do the case where T is general.

Using lemma 2.1 and remark 1.5 gives \u2265 and = in\nL\n\ninf T \u2297A X \u2265 inf T \u2212 k.fd X = inf T + depth X \u2212 depth A.\n\u0003\nIn the following theorem is used D\u2212\nfg (A), the full subcategory of D(A)\nconsisting of complexes whose cohomology vanishes in high degrees and\nconsists of finitely generated graded modules.\nTheorem 2.3. Let A satisfy depth A < \u221e and dimk ExtiA (k, A) < \u221e\nfor each i.\nLet X in Db (A) have fd X < \u221e, and let M be in D\u2212\nfg (A). Then\nsup RHomA (X, M) \u2264 sup M \u2212 depth X + depth A.\n\u2032\nProof. It is easy to see that since M is in D\u2212\nfg (A), the Matlis dual M\nis in D+ (Aop ) and has hi (M \u2032 ) a graded torsion module for each i. So\n\nsup RHomA (X, M) = sup RHomA (X, M \u2032\u2032 )\n(a)\n\nL\n\n= sup((M \u2032 \u2297A X)\u2032 )\nL\n\n= \u2212 inf M \u2032 \u2297A X\n(b)\n\n\u2264 \u2212 inf M \u2032 \u2212 depth X + depth A\n= sup M \u2212 depth X + depth A,\n\nwhere (a) is by adjunction and (b) is by lemma 2.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following is the special case of theorem 2.3 where X and M\nare concentrated in degree zero, that is, where X and M are graded\nmodules.\nTheorem 2.4 (Ext vanishing). Assume that A satisfies depth A < \u221e\nand dimk ExtiA (k, A) < \u221e for each i.\nLet X in Gr(A) have fd X < \u221e, and let M be in gr(A). Then\nExtiA (X, M) = 0 for i > depth A \u2212 depth X.\n\n\f8\n\nPETER J\u00d8RGENSEN\n\nThis says that for fd X < \u221e, the number depth A \u2212 depth X plays\nthe role of projective dimension of X, but only with respect to finitely\ngenerated graded modules M.\nOf course, this fails when M is general, as illustrated by the following\nexample.\nExample 2.5. Let A be the polynomial algebra k[x]. Then the conditions of theorem 2.4 are satisfied, and it is classical that depth A is\n1.\nLet X be k[x, x\u22121 ]. Then depth X \u2265 1 because X is a graded torsion\nfree module, so depth A \u2212 depth X \u2264 0 and theorem 2.4 gives\nExtiA (X, M) = 0 for i > 0\nfor M in gr(A).\nHowever, this must fail when M is general, for otherwise X would\nbe a projective object of Gr(A) which it is certainly not.\nAcknowledgement.
