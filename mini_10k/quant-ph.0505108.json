The approach applies to every case that has been treated via\nthe argument by Shor and Preskill, and relieve them from the constraints of finding quantum error\ncorrecting codes. It can also treat the cases with uncharacterized apparatuses. We derive a secure\nkey rate for the Bennett-Brassard-1984 protocol with an arbitrary source characterized only by a\nsingle parameter representing the basis dependence.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Dd 03.67.-a\n\nThe aim of quantum key distribution (QKD) is to distribute a secret key between two distant parties, Alice\nand Bob, under the intervention by a third party, Eve.\nFor any protocol of QKD, it is vital to have a proof of\nthe unconditional security because the robustness against\nany kind of attack allowed by the law of physics is the\nmain advantage of QKD over classical schemes aiming\nat the same task. One of the well-known strategies for\nthe security proof is the argument [1] given by Shor and\nPreskill, in which a reduction to an entanglement distillation protocol (EDP) based on Calderbank-Shor-Steane\n(CSS) quantum error correcting codes (QECC) [2, 3] is\nused to show that the information leak on the final key\nis negligible. This approach has turned out to be quite\nversatile due to the simplicity of the idea: for example,\nthe original proof for the BB84 protocol [4] has been extended [5, 6] to cover the B92 protocol [7]. On the other\nhand, invoking the CSS-QECC in the proof requires the\nactual users to find a quantum code satisfying a certain\nproperty, which is not always an easy task. Even the\ninnocent-looking formula [Eq. (1) below] for the asymptotic key gain needs a complicated argument [8] for strict\nderivation.\nIf we look back to the first proof [9] of unconditional\nsecurity by Mayers, we notice that it also has its own\nmerits. One disadvantage, the complexity of the proof,\nwas recently remedied by a simple proof [10] by Koashi\nand Preskill based on the same spirit, namely, reduction\nto a two-party protocol by omitting one of the legitimate\nusers by a symmetry argument. In this line of approach,\nthe error correction and the privacy amplification is decoupled once we encrypt the communication for the error correction, by consuming the previously shared key.\nThis implies that we do not need to find a CSS-QECC\nand we can just use conventional schemes for the error\ncorrection. The proof also shows a peculiar and useful\nproperty, which allows the use of basis-independent uncharacterized sources or detectors. For example, if we\nuse an ideal detector, the source can be anything as long\nas it does not reveal which basis is used in the BB84 pro-\n\ntocol. We can still use the same formula for the key rate,\nindicating that any fault in the source can be automatically caught in the form of an increase in the observed\nbit errors. Unfortunately, the argument of omitting one\nparty relies heavily on the symmetry of the BB84 protocol, and it cannot be applied to the protocols with no\nsuch symmetry.\nIn this paper, we present an approach to the unconditional security based on uncertainty principle. This argument has the same advantages in the Mayers-KoashiPreskill argument, while retaining the versatility of the\nShor-Preskill argument. In fact, in any protocol having\na proof that relies on the Shor-Preskill argument, we can\ndecouple the error correction and the privacy amplification just by encrypting the former, thereby relieve it from\nthe constraint of CSS-QECC. We can also treat uncharacterized apparatuses in the protocols with lower symmetry. As an example, we derive a key rate formula for\nthe BB84 protocol with an arbitrary source, the properties of which are unknown except for a bound on a single\nparameter describing the basis dependence.\nMost of the QKD protocols can be equivalently described by an entanglement-based protocol, in which Alice and Bob share a pair of quantum systems HA \u2297 HB\nafter discarding other systems used for random sampling\ntests. The state \u03c10 of HA \u2297 HB at this point is not fixed\nand may be highly correlated among subsystems due to\nEve's intervention, but the results of the tests may give a\nset of promises on the possible state. For example, in the\ncase of Shor-Preskill proof, HA \u2297 HB is composed of N\npairs of shared qubits, and there is a promise that the following statements hold except for an exponentially small\nprobability: Suppose that each qubit is measured on z\nor x basis. Then the number nbit of qubits showing the\nbit error (\u03c3z \u2297 \u03c3z = \u22121) satisfies nbit /N \u2264 \u03b4bit , and the\nnumber nph with the phase error (\u03c3x \u2297 \u03c3x = \u22121) satisfies\nnph /N \u2264 \u03b4ph . Here \u03b4bit and \u03b4ph are determined from the\nresults of the test. Here we consider more general cases,\nin which the size of HA \u2297HB is arbitrary. We give a proof\nfor the unconditional security of the protocols having the\n\n\f2\nfollowing form:\nActual Protocol - Alice and Bob make measurements\non HA and on HB , respectively. Through an encrypted\nclassical communication consuming r bits of secret key,\nthey agree on an N -bit reconciled key \u03barec , except for a\nnegligible failure probability. In the binary vector space\non N bits, one party chooses a linearly-independent set\n{Vk }k=1,...,N \u2212m of N -bit sequences randomly and announce it. The k-th bit of the final key \u03bafin is defined\nas scalar product \u03barec * Vk .\nThis protocol newly produces N \u2212 m bits of secret key,\nand the net secret key gain is N \u2212 r \u2212 m bits. The core\nof our approach is to choose a quantum operation \u039b that\nconverts state \u03c1 on HA \u2297HB to state \u039b(\u03c1) on HR \u2297K\u2297N ,\nwhere K\u2297N stands for N qubits and HR for an ancillary\nsystem R. Both the qubits and the ancilla are virtual,\nand there is no need to specify corresponding physical\nsystems in the actual protocol. We allow \u039b to involve\ncollective operations over HA and HB . We only require\nthe following property for \u039b: Let us regard \u03barec in Actual\nProtocol as the outcome of a generalized measurement\napplied on HA \u2297HB . Then, the application of \u039b followed\nby the z-basis measurements on the N qubits should be\nequivalent to this measurement of \u03barec . If \u039b is chosen in\nthis way, the security of Actual Protocol follows that of\nProtocol 1 below, in which Alice and Bob can be regarded\nas a single party:\nProtocol 1 - Apply \u039b and discard HR . For the N\nqubits K\u2297N , measure each qubit on z-basis to determine\nthe N -bit key \u03barec . Choose a linearly-independent set\n{Vk }k=1,...N \u2212m randomly, and announce it to Eve. Let\n\u03barec * Vk be the k-th bit of the final key \u03bafin .\nIn order to show that Eve has negligible information on\n\u03bafin , we consider yet another protocol. Suppose that, following \u039b, we conduct a measurement MR on the ancilla\nR to obtain outcome \u03bc, and subsequently measure each\nof the N qubits on x basis to obtain an N -bit sequence\nX. We further choose a number \u03be (depending on the test\nresults) such that the promise on the initial state \u03c10 almost guarantees that for each outcome \u03bc, we can predict\nthe value of X with N \u03be-bit uncertainty. More precisely,\nwe take the following assumption:\nAssumption - There exists a set T\u03bc of N -bit sequences\nwith cardinality |T\u03bc | \u2264 2N \u03be for each \u03bc, such that the pair\nof measurement outcomes (\u03bc, X) satisfies X \u2208 T\u03bc except\nfor an exponentially small probability \u03b7.\nNow we can invoke the uncertainty principle: Since\nthe x-basis outcomes for the N qubits can be predicted\nwith N \u03be-bit uncertainty, the complementary observable,\nnamely, the z-basis outcomes, should be predicted by any\nparty with at most N (1 \u2212 \u03be) uncertainty [11]. Hence we\nexpect to extract N (1 \u2212 \u03be) bits of secret key from the\nz-basis outcomes. This rough sketch can be made strict\nas follows.\nSuppose that, before the measurement of X, we\nchoose m = N (\u03be + \u01eb) random N -bit sequences Wj (j =\n\n1, . . . , m) and measure the parity X * Wj by a collective projection measurement on the qubits. If we define \u03a3\u03bd (W ) \u2261 \u03c3\u03bdb1 \u03c3\u03bdb2 * * * \u03c3\u03bdbN (\u03bd = x, z) for N -bit sequence W = [b1 b2 * * * bN ], the above parity measurement for X * Wj corresponds to the observable \u03a3x (Wj ).\nRecall that we know X \u2208 T\u03bc except for probability\n\u03b7. As in the hushing method of EDP [12], by knowing m random parity bits we can derive an estimate\nX \u2217 of X with an exponentially small failure probability\nP r(X \u2217 6= X) \u2264 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2261 \u03b7 + 2\u2212N \u01eb . If we apply a phase-flip\noperation \u03a3z (X \u2217 ) according to the estimate, the state \u03c3\nof the qubits should become almost a pure state, satis\u2297N\n\u2032\n\u2297N\nfying h0\u2297N\nx |\u03c3|0x i \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b7 , where |0x i is the x-basis\neigenstate for X = 0. With this property in mind, let us\nconsider the following protocol:\nProtocol 2 - Apply \u039b and make measurement MR\non HR . Choose Wj (j = 1, . . . m) randomly, and take\nan arbitrary linearly-independent set {Vk }k=1,...N \u2212m of\nN -bit sequences satisfying Vk * Wj = 0 for any j, k. Announce {Vk } to Eve. Measure \u03a3x (Wj ) to determine X \u2217 ,\nand apply \u03a3z (X \u2217 ). Measure {\u03a3z (Vk )} to determine the\n(N \u2212 m)-bit final key \u03bafin .\nWhen Assumption holds with \u01eb > 0, the above final\nkey is determined by z-basis measurements applied to \u03c3,\nwhich is very close to the x-basis pure eigenstate |0\u2297N\nx i.\nHence Eve has only negligible (at most S(\u03c3)-bit) information about \u03bafin .\nThe equivalence of the two protocols are easy to be\nseen. In Protocol 2, the operators {\u03a3z (Vk )} commute\nwith \u03a3z (X \u2217 ) and with \u03a3x (Wj ) since Vk *Wj = 0. Hence\nwe can omit the parity check and the phase flip and still\nobtain the same final key. We further notice that MR is\nnow redundant, and the choosing method of {Vk } can be\nsimplified to a random selection. Noting that {\u03a3z (Vk )}\ncan be also obtained through a z-basis measurement on\neach qubit, we are lead to Protocol 1. We thus obtain\nthe main theorem:\nTheorem - If Assumption is true for m = N (\u03be + \u01eb)\nwith \u01eb > 0, Eve's information on \u03bafin in Protocol 1 is at\nmost h(\u03b7 \u2032 ) + N \u03b7 \u2032 with \u03b7 \u2032 = \u03b7 + 2\u2212N \u01eb .\nHere we have defined h(y) \u2261 \u2212y log y\u2212(1\u2212y) log(1\u2212y).\nThe choice of \u039b and MR , which determines \u03be, is crucial\nin deriving a good lower bound of the achievable secure\nkey gain for various problems. We will discuss several\nexamples below.\nShor-Preskill case - In the situation to which the\nShor-Preskill argument applies, HA \u2297 HB corresponds to\nN pairs of qubits. In this case, we choose \u03barec to be Bob's\nmeasurement outcome on z basis. If the promise is given\nby the two numbers \u03b4bit and \u03b4ph as we mentioned earlier,\nAlice can determine \u03barec from her z-basis measurement\nand r = N [h(\u03b4ph )+ \u01eb] bits of communication from Bob in\nActual protocol. For the security proof, we choose a trivial \u039b that just changes the definition as HA \u223c\n= HR and\nHB \u223c\n= K\u2297N . We assume MR to be the x-basis measurement on Alice's N qubits. It should reveal the value of\n\n\f3\nX, which is Bob's outcome on x basis, within \u03b4ph bits of\nerrors, and Assumption holds with \u03be = h(\u03b4ph ) + \u01eb. Hence\nwe arrive at the familiar asymptotic net key gain\nG = N [1 \u2212 h(\u03b4bit ) \u2212 h(\u03b4ph )].\n\n(1)\n\nUnlike the Shor-Preskill proof, this key rate is achieved\nwithout finding a CSS-QECC.\nBB84 with a basis-independent uncharacterized source\n- This is the case where Alice uses a basis-independent\nuncharacterized source and Bob uses an ideal detector\nin the BB84 protocol, which was analyzed in [10]. Let\n\u03c1ab acting on HQ be the state of Alice's source for the\nbasis a = 0, 1 and the bit value b = 0, 1. Alice chooses\nbasis a randomly, and then with probability pab (note\nthat pa0 + pa1 = 1), Alice sends out \u03c1ab to a quantum\nchannel, which may be tampered by Eve. Bob receives\na qubit state on KB from the channel, on which he conducts the ideal z- or x-basis measurement depending on\nhis random basis choice a\u2032 = 0, 1, respectively. Subsequently, they make a and a\u2032 public. After repeating this\nmany times, they randomly sample events with a = a\u2032 to\ndetermine the observed error rates \u03b4a for a = 0, 1. Bob\nrandomly picks N outcomes from the unsampled data\nwith a = a\u2032 = 0 to define \u03barec . Alice obtains \u03barec with\nthe help of a secret communication from Bob consuming\nr = N [h(\u03b40 ) + \u01eb] bits of secret key. (The portion with\na = a\u2032 = 1 can be handled similarly.)\nThe basis-independent source satisfies \u03c10 = \u03c11 , where\n\u03c1a \u2261 pa0 \u03c1a0 + pa1 \u03c1a1 . Then, we can find a state \u03c7 on\nHS \u2297 HQ and measurements Ma on HS with POVM elements {Fa0 , Fa1 }, such that TrS [(Fab \u2297 1Q )\u03c7] = pab \u03c1ab .\nWe are thus allowed to consider an equivalent protocol in\nwhich Alice prepares \u03c7 and conducts measurement Ma\non HS to determine her bit value b. This new protocol\ntakes the form of Actual protocol by defining HA = HS\u2297N\n\u2297N\nand HB = KB\n. For the security proof, we choose a trivial \u039b that just changes the definition as HA \u223c\n= HR and\nHB \u223c\n= K\u2297N . We then assume MR to be M1 applied on\neach HS . In order to establish a statement like Assumption, we need to know the relation between the outcome\nof M1 and the outcome of the x-basis measurement on\nKB . Fortunately, this is exactly the same pair of measurements used in determining the error rate \u03b41 . Hence\nAssumption holds with \u03be = h(\u03b41 ) + \u01eb, and we obtain the\nasymptotic net key gain\nG = N [1 \u2212 h(\u03b40 ) \u2212 h(\u03b41 )].\n\n(2)\n\nNote that everything we need in the actual protocol is\n\u03b40 and \u03b41 . There is no need to know the identities of \u03c7\nand Ma , and hence no need to characterize the source\nto determine \u03c1ab , as long as it is guaranteed to be basisindependent.\nBB84 with a basis-dependent uncharacterized source -\nThe main theorem allows us to prove unconditional security in the general case of \u03c10 6= \u03c11 . Of course, we need\n\nto know something about the source states since the protocol is entirely insecure if \u03c10 and \u03c11 are orthogonal. A\nnatural choice is to assume that we know a single parameter \u2206, which determines a lower bound on the fidelity\n[13, 14] between the two states:\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(3)\n1 \u2212 2\u2206 \u2264 F (\u03c10 , \u03c11 ) \u2261 Tr( \u03c11 \u03c10 \u03c11 )1/2 .\n\nNote that for F < 1, we can still find two pure states |\u03c70 i\nand |\u03c71 i in HS \u2297HQ satisfying h\u03c70 |\u03c71 i = 1\u22122\u2206 such that\nfor each value of a, there is a POVM measurement Ma =\n{Fa0 , Fa1 } on HS satisfying TrS [(Fab \u2297 1Q )|\u03c7a ih\u03c7a |] =\npab \u03c1ab . For a special case where HS includes a qubit\nas a subsystem and M0 and M1 are the standard xand z-basis measurement on that qubit, Gottesman et\nal. [15] derived a secure key rate along the line of ShorPreskill argument, which allows positive key gain up to\n\u2206 < 0.029. Here we can derive a better key rate formula\nfor arbitrary states {\u03c1ab }.\nLet us consider an equivalent protocol in which Alice\nchooses the basis a by measuring a \"quantum coin\" [15]\ndescribed by a qubit KC . If she prepares\u221aHS \u2297 HQ \u2297 KC\nin state |\u03a8i \u2261 (|\u03c70 i|0z iC + |\u03c71 i|1z iC )/ 2 and measure\nKC on z basis, the outcome a is random and HS \u2297 HQ is\nprepared in state |\u03c7a i. Then she conducts measurement\nMa on HS to prepare \u03c1ab with probability pab . In order\nto prove security, we follow the same argument as in the\nbasis-independent case up to the point where we need to\nknow the relation between the outcome of M1 and that\nof x-basis measurement on KB . Unfortunately, we have\nno direct clue this time. The expected error rate \u03b4ph in\nthis fictitious set of measurements is no longer equal to\n\u03b41 , since the former is taken for a = 0 and the latter is\nfor a = 1.\nIn order to determine upper bounds on \u03b4ph , let us consider the following scenario. Alice starts from |\u03a8i\u2297L ,\nand she immediately sends the L copies of system Q into\nthe channel. After Eve's attack, Bob receives the qubits\n\u2297L\nKB\n. For every pair of systems HS \u2297KB , Bob may choose\na\u2032 randomly, but regardless of its value, measurement\nM1 and x-basis measurement are applied to determine\nwhether there is an error (t = 1) or not (t = 0). Finally,\nAlice measures the coin KC on z basis to determine a.\nLet us denote the empirical probability for the L events\nby r(*). For example, r(t = 1|a = 0) is the number of\nevents with (t = 1, a = 0) divided by that of events with\na = 0.\nThe rate \u03b4ph can be regarded as an error rate in a fair\nsampling from the events with a = a\u2032 = 0. Since a\u2032 has no\neffect in the above scenario, it can also be regarded as a\nfair sampling from the events with a = 0. We thus have\n\u03b4ph \u223c\n= r(t = 1|a = 1).\n= r(t = 1|a = 0). Similarly, \u03b41 \u223c\nSince r(a = 0) \u223c\n= 1/2, we have\n\u223c \u03b41 /(\u03b41 +\u03b4ph ),\nr(t = 1) \u223c\n= (\u03b41 +\u03b4ph )/2, r(a = 1|t = 1) =\n\u223c\nr(a = 0|t = 0) = (1 \u2212 \u03b4ph )/(2 \u2212 \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b4ph ). (4)\n\n\f4\nNow we describe two methods of deriving a bound on\n\u03b4ph . The first one is to apply the main theorem for\u2297L\nmally to the coins, regarding KC\nas K\u2297N in the theo2\nrem. Since kC h1x ||\u03a8ik = \u2206, it is guaranteed that we\ncan distill a secret key of length L(1 \u2212 h(\u2206) \u2212 \u01eb) from the\nz-basis measurement results. This implies that even with\nthe knowledge of each t, the entropy of the outcomes a\nshould be larger than L(1 \u2212 h(\u2206) \u2212 \u01eb). Hence we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b41 + \u03b4ph\n\u03b41\n1 \u2212 h(\u2206) \u2264\nh\n2\n\u03b41 + \u03b4ph\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 \u03b4ph\n1 \u2212 |\u03b4ph \u2212 \u03b41 |\n2 \u2212 \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b4ph\nh\n,\n\u2264h\n+\n2\n2 \u2212 \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b4ph\n2\n(5)\nwhich shows that \u03b4ph = \u03b41 for \u2206 = 0 and \u03b4ph becomes\nlarger when \u2206 > 0. If we write the maximum of \u03b4ph\nunder the above first inequality as f (\u03b41 , \u2206), the key gain\nis given by\nG = N [1 \u2212 h(\u03b40 ) \u2212 h(max{1/2, f (\u03b41, \u2206)})].\n\n(6)\n\nThis key gain is positive only for \u2206 < 0.056.\nThe second method is more complicated, but gives a\nbetter rate. We assume that for each event, Alice draws\na random binary variable s with a small probability of\nbeing s = 1. If s = 0, she just follows the above scenario, but if s = 1, she measures the coin KC on x basis\ninstead of z basis. Let \u0101 be the outcome of this x basis\nmeasurement, and define rx,j \u2261 r(\u0101 = 1|s = 1, t = j)\nand rz,j \u2261 r(a = 0|s = 0, t = j) for j = 0, 1. Since\nkC h1x ||\u03a8ik2 = \u2206, we have\nr(t = 0)rx,0 + r(t = 1)rx,1 = r(\u0101 = 1|s = 1) \u223c\n= \u2206.\n\n(7)\n\nNote that rx,j is determined from the outcomes of xbasis measurements applied to random samples from the\nqubits with t = j, and rz,j is from the z-basis outcomes\nfor the rest of the qubits. This problem of random sampling was analysed in [5], and it was shown that for all\n\u01eb > 0, except for an exponentially small probability, there\nexists a qubit state \u03c1 such that |rz,j \u2212 h0z |\u03c1|0z i| < \u01eb and\n|rx,j \u2212 h1x |\u03c1|1x i| < \u01eb. We thus obtain the following relation in the asymptotic limit:\n(1 \u2212 2rx,j )2 + (1 \u2212 2rz,j )2 \u2264 1.\n\n(8)\n\nCombining it with r(t = 1) \u223c\n=\n= (\u03b41 + \u03b4ph )/2, rz,1 \u223c\n\u223c\n\u03b4ph /(\u03b41 +\u03b4ph ), rz,0 = (1\u2212\u03b4ph )/(2\u2212\u03b41 \u2212\u03b4ph ), and Eq. (7),\nwe obtain\nq\np\n2\u2206 \u2265 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b41 )(1 \u2212 \u03b4ph ) \u2212 \u03b41 \u03b4ph .\n(9)\nWe can now take f (\u03b41 , \u2206) to be the maximum of \u03b4ph\nunder Eq. (9), and obtain a better key rate with Eq. (6).\nNow the region of positive key gain extends to \u2206 < 0.146,\nor F (\u03c10 , \u03c11 ) > 1/2. Since Alice and Bob do not use the\n\noutcome \u0101, this measurement can be omitted. Hence, in\nthe actual BB84 protocol, they only have to discard a\nsmall portion of events. From Eve's point of view, Alice\ncould have measured \u0101 for the discarded events, and it is\nenough to apply the above security proof.\nWe have described a method of proving the unconditional security which unifies two major previous approaches and retains the advantages in both of them. We\nhave also shown that the new method can solve a problem\nwhich eluded the previous approaches. The proof relies\non the observation that Alice can guess the z-basis outcomes of virtual N qubits with r-bit uncertainty in the\nactual protocol, and Alice and Bob can guess the x-basis\noutcomes with m-bit uncertainty in a equivalent protocol. The \"excess\" over the uncertainty limit, N \u2212 r \u2212 m,\namounts to the key gain. Note that if they share a maximally entangled state, Alice alone can guess for both of\nthe bases. The condition for the secrecy is weaker than\nthat since it allows her to collaborate with Bob nonlocally for the x basis. This difference is considered to\nbe a reason for the gap between distillable entanglement\nand secret key gain [16]. This suggests that the present\nmethod may potentially give a key rate exceeding the\namount of distillable entanglement.\nThe author thanks N. Imoto and J. Preskill for helpful\ndiscussions.
