Introduction\nThe Ly\u03b1 line plays an important role in a variety of astrophysical problems, especially as a diagnostic tool to observe\nand study the high redshift universe. It is a simple redshift indicator for distant galaxies, a frequently used star formation\nrate diagnostic at high z, as well as an important tool probing\nthe ionisation state of the intergalactic medium and hence the\nreionisation epoch. The Ly\u03b1 emission line is e.g. a strong feature observed in nearby star forming galaxies, distant Lyman\nbreak galaxies (LBGs), sub-mm galaxies, emission line selected galaxies (LAE, for Lyman-\u03b1 emitters), and in the enigmatic so called Lyman-\u03b1 blobs (LABs) whose nature remains\ndebated (e.g. Steidel et al. 2000, Dijkstra et al. 2005b).\nSince the early suggestion of strong Ly\u03b1 emission from\nyoung high redshift galaxies by Partridge & Peebles (1967) and\nSend offprint requests to: daniel.schaerer@obs.unige.ch\n\nuntil the late 1990s, only few Ly\u03b1 emitters have been found (cf.\nDjorgovski & Thompson 1992). This lack of Ly\u03b1 emission detection has triggered a variety of studies discussing the possible physical effects (mostly metallicity, dust, neutral gas kinematics, and geometry) which may significantly affect and suppress the Ly\u03b1 emission and the resonance line radiation transfer, thereby reducing the observed Ly\u03b1 intensity and destroying\nsimple expected correlations, e.g. between Ly\u03b1 intensity and\nmetallicity, Ly\u03b1 intensity and UV continuum flux and others\n(Meier & Terlevich 1981, Hartmann et al. 1988, Neufeld 1990,\nCharlot & Fall 1993, Valls-Gabaud 1993, Kunth et al. 1998,\nTenorio-Tagle et al. 1999, Mas-Hesse et al. 2003).\nIn the last few years, with the availability of deeper and\nwider surveys such as the Large Area Lyman Alpha (LALA)\nsurvey and the Subaru Deep Field survey, many emission\ngalaxies have been detected (cf. Hu et al. 1998, 2004; Kudritzki\net al. 2000, Rhoads et al. 2000, Ouchi et al. 2003, Taniguchi\n\n\f2\n\nVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\net al. 2005). Although the majority of these distant Ly\u03b1 emitters shows rather simple asymmetric line profiles, the overall\ndiversity of the observed Ly\u03b1 line shapes, both from star forming galaxies in the nearby universe and at high-z, is quite heterogeneous and complex. The observed line profiles include\nschematically pure Voigt absorption profiles, P-Cygni profiles,\ndouble peak profiles, pure (symmetric) emission line profiles,\nand combinations thereof (see e.g. Kunth et al. 1998, MasHesse et al. 2003, Shapley et al. 2003, M\u00f6ller et al. 2004,\nVenemans et al. 2005, Wilman et al. 2005, Noll et al. 2004,\nTapken et al. 2004, Tapken 2005).\nAlthough in principle the main physical processes shaping\nthe Ly\u03b1 line are known, in practice the inferences drawn so\nfar from Ly\u03b1 observations rely mostly on rather simple measurements (e.g. line flux) or on oversimplified Voigt-profile fits,\nwhich often have no strong physical motivations. For example,\nfor a Ly\u03b1 line profile formed purely within a galaxy (i.e. neglecting subsequent alterations from the intergalactic medium\nand/or intervening clouds), it is physically inconsistent to fit\none or several Voigt profiles without making strong implicit assumptions on the geometry of the neutral gas. In such a case,\ndue to the resonance scattering nature of Ly\u03b1 it is in fact unlikely that the resulting emergent line profile is actually a Voigt\nprofile and a detailed radiation transfer calculation has thus to\nbe carried out to predict the proper shape of the emergent resonance line profile. In general, quantitative simulations for appropriate geometries and gas kinematics, which take properly\ninto account the main physical processes of Ly\u03b1 line formation\nand radiation transfer are therefore needed for a better understanding of the variety of observed Ly\u03b1 line profile morphologies. The physical properties of the Ly\u03b1 emission mechanism\nand the ones of the ambient gas hosting the Ly\u03b1 emitter, which\nboth shape the observed Ly\u03b1 line, must be properly modeled to\ninvestigate the correspondent impact on the emergent line profile and their possible degeneracies. This in turn will provide\nuseful hints to guide the interpretation of the observed profiles\nand to gain insight on the physical properties of the Ly\u03b1 emitters and of their environment.\nAnalytic solutions for the Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer problem\nhave been derived for simple geometries. Neufeld (1990) has\nextensively studied the case of static plane parallel slabs, yielding important insight on the line formation mechanism and providing solutions for configuration including dust, Bowen fluorescence and Ly\u03b1 pumping of H2 Lyman band lines. The case\nof a static, uniform sphere has been recently studied by Dijkstra\net al. (2005a). Loeb & Rybicky (1999) and Rybicky & Loeb\n(1999) have derived solutions for Ly\u03b1 scattering in a Hubble\nflow. However, more general geometries and velocity fields do\nnot allow for an analytic solution and require alternative approaches.\nOver the last few years, several groups have developed new\nnumerical algorithms, mostly based on Monte Carlo techniques\n(Spaans 1996, Ahn et al. 2001, 2002; 2003, Ahn 2004; Zheng\n& Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2002; Richling et al. 2001; Richling 2003;\nKobayashi & Kamaya 2004; Cantalupo et al. 2005; Dijkstra\net al. 2005ab; Hansen & Oh 2006; Tasitsiomi 2006). Some of\nthese codes have been specifically designed for and can be reliably applied only to particular configurations: relatively low\n\ncolumn densities (Richling et al. 2001; Richling 2003), Hubble\nflows (Kobayashi & Kamaya 2004), 1D geometry (Ahn et al.),\nspherically symmetric configurations Dijkstra et al. 2005ab);\nothers are strongly tailored towards cosmological simulations\n(Cantalupo et al. 2005, Tasitsiomi 2006) and can deal with\nclumpy/inhomogeneous media (Spaans, 1996; Richling, 2003;\nHansen & Oh 2006). In addition, the effect of dust absorption,\nwhich is one of the most important factor affecting Ly\u03b1 transmission, is treated only in some of the codes above.\nIn any case, none of these studies has attempted to explain\nsystematically the observed variety of Ly\u03b1 line profile morphologies. Furthermore, none of the above schemes has so far\nattempted a detailed modeling of individual galaxies, taking\ninto account the available observational constraints, i.e. constraints on the stellar populations, the ionised and neutral interstellar medium, on dust extinction and including their spatial\ndistribution and kinematics. All this lack in the actual theoretical modeling needs to be filled up, in order to extract some\ninformation from the huge reservoir contained in the available observational data. With these objectives in mind, and\nwith the main aim of improving our understanding of Ly\u03b1 in\nboth nearby and distant starburst galaxies, we have developed\na general-purpose 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer code applicable to\narbitrary geometries and velocity fields.\nIn the present paper we provide a description of the code\nand test its validity against known solutions and results from\nother codes reported in the literature. Exploring different geometries, dust-free and dusty media, and different input spectra (e.g. line emission, or continuum + line), we examine\nthe resulting line profiles and their dependence on various\nphysical parameters. Our immediate goals are to obtain an\noverview over the possible Ly\u03b1 line profile morphologies, and\nto gain physical insight into the processes governing them.\nApplications to observed galaxies and other simulations will\nbe presented later.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. A description of the radiation transfer code is given in Sect. 2. Tests\nof the code and results for simple geometrical configurations\n(slabs, infalling/expanding halos) are presented in Sect. 3. In\nSect. 4 we comment on the formation of damped (Voigt) Ly\u03b1\nprofiles and related profiles. Spherically expanding dust-free\nor dusty shells are re-examined in Sect. 5. An overview of the\npredicted Ly\u03b1 line profile morphologies and qualitative comparisons with observations is given in Sect. 6. Our main conclusion are summarised in Sect. 7.\n\n2. Radiation transfer code\nA general 3D radiation transfer code MCLya allowing for arbitrary hydrogen density, ionisation & temperature structures,\ndust distributions, and velocity fields was developed using a\nMonte Carlo technique. The input files and the structure of the\ncode have been designed for a future joint use with the 3D radiation transfer and photoionisation code CRASH of Maselli\net al. (2003). We now summarise the main ingredients and assumptions made in this code.\n\n\fVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\n2.1. Geometry\n\n3\n\nThe present version of the code assumes a 3D cartesian grid\nof n3 cells. Typically we adopt n = 128. The relevant quantities describing a 3D structure are the neutral hydrogen density\ndistribution, the dust density distribution, the temperature distribution, and the velocity field. These are prescribed by input\nfiles.\n\nMaxwellian distribution of atoms velocities whose velocity dispersion, Vth = (2 kB T/mH )1/2 = 12.85T 41/2 km s\u22121 , corresponds\nto the Doppler frequency width \u2206\u03bdD = (Vth /c)\u03bd0 . Here T 4 is the\ngas temperature in units of 104 K. In certain cases an additional\nturbulent motion, characterised by Vturb , is taken into account\nin the Doppler parameter b given by\nq\n2 .\n(3)\nb = Vth2 + Vturb\n\n2.2. Photon sources\n\nLet us now introduce some useful variables. First the frequency shift in Doppler units\n\nLy\u03b1 and/or continuum photons are emitted from one or several\npoint sources. Each source is described by :\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nits location,\nthe total number of emitted photons\noptionally their emission direction, if not isotropic,\nthe source spectrum (typically monochromatic, a constant\nphoton density per frequency or wavelength interval, a\nGaussian, or combinations thereof).\n\n2.3. Physical processes\nTo capture the essentials of radiation transfer in the UV including and around the Ly\u03b1 line we include three main physical processes, dust absorption and scattering and the Ly\u03b1 line\ntransfer, in the present version of our code. Given the principles of Monte Carlo simulations, other processes can easily be\nincluded in the future, if desirable.\n\n2.3.1. Ly\u03b1 line transfer\nIn the whole section, we describe the Ly\u03b1 radiative transfer\nequations in a static medium. To adapt them to moving media,\nwe just convert frequencies to local co-moving frequencies and\nconvert them back to the external frame by a Lorentz transformation, neglecting terms of order O(v2 /c2 ).\nA Ly\u03b1 photon corresponds to the transition between the\nn = 2 and n = 1 levels of a hydrogen atom. This is the\nstrongest H \uf769 transition, with an Einstein coefficient given by\nA21 = 6.265 \u00d7 108 s\u22121 . The scattering cross-section of a Ly\u03b1\nphoton as a function of frequency in the rest frame of the hydrogen atom is:\n\u03c3\u03bd = f12\n\n\u0393/4 \u03c02\n\u03c0 e2\n,\nme c (\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 )2 + (\u0393/4 \u03c0)2\n\n\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 V\n= ,\n\u2206\u03bdD\nb\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the second equation gives the relation between x and a\nmacroscopic velocity component V measured along the photon\npropagation (i.e. parallel to the light path and in the same direc\u03c0\n\u22124 \u22121/2\n,\ntion). Second the Voigt parameter a \u2261 \u0393/4\n\u2206\u03bdD = 4.7 \u00d7 10 T 4\nor more generally a = 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 (12.85 km s\u22121/b) for non-zero\nturbulent velocity. Adopting this notation, it can be shown that:\n\u03c4 x (s) = \u03c3H (x) nH s = 1.041 \u00d7 10\u221213 T 4 \u22121/2 NH\n\nH(x, a)\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\nwhere nH is the neutral hydrogen density, and NH the corresponding column density. The Hjerting function H(x, a) describes the Voigt absorption profile,\n\uf8f1 \u2212x2\nZ\n2\n\uf8f4\ne\u2212y dy\na \u221e\nif |x| < xc\n\uf8f2e\n\u2248\uf8f4 a\nH(x, a) =\n(6)\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e (y \u2212 x)2 + a2 \uf8f3 \u221a\u03c0x2 if |x| > xc\n\nwhich is often approximated by a central resonant core and\npower-law \"damping wings\" for frequencies below/above a\ncertain boundary frequency xc between core and wings. For\na in the range of 10\u22122 to 10\u22126 , xc varies typically from 2.5 to\n4. To evaluate H in our code, we use the fit formulae given by\nGray (1992).\nTo characterise the depth of a static medium we will use \u03c40 ,\nthe optical depth at line center:\n\u03c40 (s) = 1.041 \u00d7 10\u221213 T 4\u22121/2 NH\n\nH(0, a)\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\n\u2248 3.31 \u00d7 10\u221214 T 4\u22121/2 NH\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nfor zero turbulent velocity, or more generally\n(1)\n\nwhere f12 = 0.4162 is the Ly\u03b1 oscillator strength, \u03bd0 = 2.466 \u00d7\n1015 Hz is the line center frequency, and \u0393 = A12 is the damping\nconstant which measures the natural line width.\nThe optical depth \u03c4\u03bd (s) of a photon with frequency \u03bd traveling a path of length s is determined by convolving the above\ncross-section with the velocity distribution characteristic of the\nabsorbing gas, and is of the form:\nZ sZ \u221e\n\u03c4\u03bd (s) =\nn(Vz) \u03c3\u03bd dVz dl,\n(2)\n0\n\nx=\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere Vz denotes the velocity component along the photon's\ndirection. Thermal motions of Hydrogen are described by a\n\n\u03c40 (s) = 3.31 \u00d7 10\u221214 (12.85 km s\u22121/b) NH\n\n(9)\n\nThis monochromatic optical depth \u03c40 has been used in most\nrecent studies (e.g. Ahn et al. 2001, 2002; Zheng & MiraldaEscud\u00e9 2002, Hansen & Oh 2006); however, it differs from\nthe total Ly\u03b1 optical depth \u03c4Neuf\n0\u221a used in the classical work of\nNeufeld (1990) by \u03c4Neuf\n=\n\u03c4\n0 \u03c0.\n0\nOnce the absorption probability is given and before the\nLy\u03b1 photon is re-emitted, its frequency and angular distribution must be determined. If the atom is not perturbed by collisions during the time a Ly\u03b1 photon is absorbed and re-emitted,\nthe frequencies before and after scattering are identical in the\natom's rest-frame. On the other hand, when the atom undergo\na collision, the electron is reshuffled on another energy level\n\n\f4\n\nVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\nand the frequencies before and after scattering are uncorrelated.\nGiven the typically low densities in astrophysical media, we assume coherent scattering in our code.\nConcerning the angular redistribution, our code can model\nthe case of isotropic as well as the more realistic dipolar redistribution. In the case of isotropy, for simplicity and speed\nwe use the angle averaged frequency redistribution function\nRII\u2212A (xin , xout ) from Hummer(1962). In practice we use pretabulated values of the cumulative frequency distribution function\nof RII\u2212A for different input frequencies and temperatures. In\nall the static geometries presented in this paper, we use an\nisotropic angular redistribution. As test calculations confirm\n(cf. Fig 1 and also Zheng & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2002 and Hansen\n& Oh 2006) this is an excellent approximation since the Ly\u03b1\nphotons undergo a very large number of scatterings where any\nangular preference is smeared out.\nTo avoid numerous core scatterings in static cases with a\nhigh column density, different acceleration methods have been\ndeveloped in other radiation transfer codes (e.g. Ahn & Lee\n2002, Djikstra & Haiman 2005a). In our case, such an acceleration is easily included in the redistribution functions by setting artificially RII\u2212A (xin , xout ) = \u01eb where \u01eb is close to zero for\n|xin | < xc and |xout | < xc , which corresponds to setting the probability to be re-emitted at |xout | < xc to zero, when photons\nare absorbed in the core (i.e. when |xin | < xc ). In practice we\nhave not used the acceleration method except for test cases, as\nit turns out that all cases shown here are tractable without it.\nThe dipolar angular redistribution has been implemented\nwithout the use of redistribution functions, but microscopically,\nfollowing the detailed descriptions of former codes (cf. Zheng\n& Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2002 and Dijkstra & Haiman 2005a). The\nnecessity to use this more physical redistribution is particularly\nimportant for expanding shells (see section 5).\n\n2.3.2. Dust scattering and absorption\nDuring its travel in an astrophysical medium, the Ly\u03b1 photon\nwill diffuse on H atoms, but it can also interact with dust: it can\neither be scattered, or absorbed. The dust cross-section \u03c3d is\ncomposed of an absorption cross-section \u03c3a , and a scattering\ncross-section \u03c3 s :\n\u03c3d = \u03c3a + \u03c3 s\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03c3a,s = \u03c0 d2 Qa,s , with d the typical dust grain size which\nwill affect Ly\u03b1 photons, and Qa,s the absorption/scattering efficiency. At UV wavelengths the two processes are equally\nlikely, Qa \u2248 Q s \u2248 1, so the dust albedo A = Q s /(Qa + Q s )\nis around 0.5: half of the photons interacting with dust will be\nlost, and half will be re-emitted in the Ly\u03b1 line.\nWe assume that the dust density nd is proportional to the\nneutral H density in each cell\nnd = n H \u00d7\n\nmH Md\n,\nmd MH\n\n(11)\n\nwhere md is the grain mass and mH the proton mass. The relevant quantity, \u03c4d given just below, is described by one free\nMd\nassuming d = 10\u22126 cm and\nparameter, the dust to gas ratio M\nH\n\nmd = 3 \u00d7 10\u221217 g. The total (absorption + scattering) dust optical depth seen by a Ly\u03b1 photon is then:\nZ s\n\u03c4d = \u03c4a + \u03c4 s =\n\u03c3d nd (s) ds.\n(12)\n0\n\nThe relation between the dust absorption optical depth at\nLy\u03b1 wavelength \u03c4a = (1 \u2212 A)\u03c4d and the color excess E B\u2212V is\ngiven by\nE B\u2212V = 1.086\n\nAV\n\u03c4a \u2248 (0.06 . . . 0.11) \u03c4a\nA1216 R\n\n(13)\n\nwhere AV and A1216 is the extinction in the V band and at 1216\n\u00c5 respectively, R the total-to-selective extinction. The smaller\nnumerical value corresponds to a Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation law for starbursts, the larger to the Galactic extinction law\nfrom Seaton (1979).\n\n2.4. Monte Carlo radiation transfer\nFor each photon source we emit photons one by one, and we\nfollow each photon until escape from our simulation box or\nabsorption by dust. Let us now describe one photon's travel.\n\n2.4.1. Initial emission\nThe emission of a photon is characterised by an emission frequency and direction. The frequency \u03bd (here in the \"external\",\ni.e. observer's frame) samples the source spectrum representing usually Ly\u03b1 line emission and/or UV continuum photons.\nFor media with constant temperature, \u03bd or more precisely the\nemission frequency shift from the line center, is conveniently\nexpressed in Dopper units, i.e. x = (\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 )/\u2206\u03bdD (cf. Eq. 4).\nWe assume that the source emission is isotropic (in the local co-moving frame, if the considered geometry is not static).\nThus the emission direction, described by the two angles \u03b8 and\n\u03c6, is randomly selected from\n\u03b8 = cos\u22121 (2 \u03be1 \u2212 1)\n\u03c6 = 2 \u03c0 \u03be2\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03be1,2 are random numbers 1 , 0 \u2264 \u03be1,2 < 1. The photon\ntravels in this direction until it undergoes an interaction. In\nmoving media, the photon frequency in the external frame is\nevaluated by a Lorentz transformation.\n\n2.4.2. Location of interaction\nThe location of interaction is determined as follows. The optical depth, \u03c4int , that the photon will travel is determined by\nsampling the interaction probability distribution P(\u03c4) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4\nby setting\n\u03c4int = \u2212ln(1 \u2212 \u03be)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03be is another random number.\n1\nThe random numbers generator used in the code is the ran function from Numerical Recipies in Fortran 90 (Chapter B7, page 1142)\n\n\fVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\n5\n\nWe sum the optical depth \u03c4 along the photon path s:\n\u03c4(s) = \u03c4 x (s) + \u03c4d (s)\n\n(17)\n\nand we determine the length s corresponding to \u03c4(s) = \u03c4int . We\ncalculate the coordinates corresponding to a travel of length s\nin the direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) starting from the emission point. This is\nthe location of interaction. Now, we have to compute if the Ly\u03b1\nphoton interacts with a dust grain or a hydrogen atom.\n\n2.4.3. Interaction with H or Dust ?\nThe probability to be scattered by a hydrogen atom is given by:\nPH (x) =\n\nnH \u03c3H (x)\n,\nnH \u03c3H (x) + nd \u03c3d\n\n(18)\n\n2\nf12 me\u03c0ce\u2206\u03bdD\n\nH(x, a) is the hydrogen cross section\nwhere \u03c3H (x) =\nfor a Ly\u03b1 photon of frequency x. We generate a random number\n0 \u2264 \u03be < 1 and compare it to PH : if \u03be < PH , the photon interacts\nwith H, otherwise it is scattered or absorbed by dust.\n\n2.4.4. Scattering on H atoms\nWhen the photon is absorbed by an H atom, how will it be\nreemitted ?\nWe first convert the frequency in the external (observers)\nframe, \u03bdext , to the comoving frequency of the fluid, \u03bdint , with a\nLorentz transformation\n\u03bdint = \u03bdext (1 \u2212\n\nki * V\n),\nc\n\nFig. 1. Predicted emergent Ly\u03b1 profiles for monochromatic line\nradiation emitted in a dust-free slab of different optical depths\n(solid lines) compared with analytic solutions from Neufeld\n(1990, dashed). The dotted blue curve shows the line profile\nobtained using a frequency redistribution function, which skips\na large number of resonant core scatterings. The adopted conditions of the medium are: T = 10 K (i.e. a = 1.5 10\u22122), and\n\u03c40 = 104 , 105 , 106 from top to bottom. The green long-dashed\ncurve, obtained with a dipolar angular redistribution, overlaps\nperfectly the black solid line, obtained with the isotropic angular redistribution function, illustrating the fact that in static\nmedia, isotropy is a very good approximation.\n\n(19)\n\nwhere ki is the photon direction and V the macroscopic/bulk\nvelocity of the H atoms. As already mentioned above, we assume partially coherent scattering and either isotropic or dipolar angular redistribution. After scattering, the new frequency\nis again converted back to the external frame.\n\n2.4.5. Dust scattering and absorption\nWhen the photon interacts with dust, we generate a random\nnumber 0 \u2264 \u03be < 1 determining whether it is absorbed or scattered. In practice, if \u03be < A = Q s /(Qa + Q s ) the photon is\nscattered by dust and simply reemitted coherently. Otherwise\nthe photon is absorbed by dust and is considered lost for the\npresent simulation. For the same reasons already discussed\nabove (Sect. 2.3.1) we currently assume that dust scattering is isotropic, but other angular distributions (e.g. HenyeyGreenstein functions) can easily be implemented.\n\nFig. 2. Same as Fig. 1 for a slab of small optical depth (\u03c40 =\n104 ) and high temperature T = 104 K (a = 4.7 10\u22124) illustrating\nthe deviation from the analytic solution of Neufeld (1990) due\nto the more complete treatment of the line absorption profile\n(see text).\n\n2.4.6. Output\nThe precedent scheme is repeated until the photon escapes the\nsimulation volume, or undergoes a dust absorption. Then, we\nstore all the information concerning this photon in a matrix and\nstart with the next photon. This procedure is repeated for all\nphotons and all emission sources. Finally all the desired results, such as spatially integrated line profiles, monochromatic\nor integrated Ly\u03b1 images, surface brightness contours for any\n\ngiven line of sight and spatial resolution etc. are computed from\nthis output matrix. For reasons of symmetry, and to maximise\nthe numerical efficiency, all the spectra presented hereafter are\nintegrated spectra over all directions, except if mentioned otherwise (cf Fig 11).\n\n\f6\n\nVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\n3. Validation of the code and examination of\nsimple geometrical configurations\nTo validate/test our code and to gain insight into basic properties of the Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer we have computed a large\nnumber of simulations for geometrical setups discussed previously in the literature : slabs, expanding/infalling halos, expanding shells that we will present in details hereafter, and\ndisk-like configurations for which we have perfect agreement\nwith Richling et al. (2003).\nWe consider various input spectra (i.e. the intrinsic emission line profile and possible continuum emission), especially\nthe limiting cases of a pure monochromatic (i.e. line) radiation.\nBoth cases with or without dust are considered. The case of a\nsource emitting a pure continuum in a plane parallel slab with\nand without dust is discussed in Sect. 4.\n\n3.1. Homogeneous slab\nThe best studied case is that of a plane parallel homogeneous\nslab, for which analytic solutions of the Ly\u03b1 transfer problem\nhave been derived and discussed in depth by Neufeld (1990).\nFor a given source position and input spectrum, the main physical quantities determining the output spectrum are the temperature of the medium and its optical depth, whatever the angular redistribution is. Note that in this section, all profiles have\nbeen obtained using isotropic angular redistribution, except if\nthe contrary is specified.\n\nFig. 3. Predicted emergent Ly\u03b1 profiles for monochromatic line\nradiation emitted in a slab of optical depth \u03c40 = 106 , T = 10 K,\nand \u03c4a = 10\u22123 and 0. The black solid line shows the emergent\nprofile without dust and the blue dotted line the one with dust.\nThe red dashed line shows the (unobservable) spectrum of the\nphotons which have been absorbed by dust. The effect of dust\nseems \"grey\" on the emergent line profile because \u03c4dust is very\nweak. For greater \u03c4dust , the inner part of the peaks is destroyed.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, our spectra are in perfect agreement with\nNeufeld's predictions2. The spectra are double peaked and\nsymmetric around x = 0. The peak frequency x p reflects the\nphysical properties of the neutral medium\n\nusing our acceleration method (cf. Sect. 2.3.1) yield excellent\nagreement.\nFor higher temperature, i.e. smaller a (see Fig. 2) our spectrum differs from the analytic solution of Neufeld (1990), as\nalso noticed by Ahn et al. (2001) and Zheng & Miralda-Escud\u00e9\n(2002). This is due to the simplified assumption of a power-law\nline profile in the wings, which Neufeld (1990) assumes to be\nvalid for the entire absorption line profile H (cf. Sect. 2.3.1). As\na consequence our peaks are more separated and less symmetric than expected from Neufeld's calculation. This is due to the\nfact that Neufeld's approximation of H underestimates the absorption probability in the core, such that photons escape more\neasily than in the real case and their mean escape frequency\nremains closer to the line center.\nFor Neufeld's analytical solution, based on the assumption\na\nthat H(x, a) \u2248 \u221a\u03c0x\n2 as in Lorentz wings, to be valid, a minimum criterium is that the optical depth at the frequency xc corresponding to the transition between core and wings is larger\nthan 1. Otherwise, most of the Ly\u03b1 photons will escape from\nthe core where Neufeld's approximation is not valid. In\u221apractice, since \u03c4crit = \u03c4(xc ) = 1 corresponds to (a\u03c40 )crit = \u03c0x2c ,\nthe analytic solutions of Neufeld (1990) are valid only for sufficiently large optical depths, i.e. for a \u03c40 > (a \u03c40 )crit .\n\nx p \u2248 \u00b1 0.88(a \u03c40)1/3 .\n\n3.1.2. Monochromatic radiation and dust\n\n3.1.1. Monochromatic radiation, no dust\nAs a first test we simulate a dust-free slab with a central\nplane source emitting Ly\u03b1 photons in the line center (i.e. \u03bd0 =\n2.46 \u00d7 1015 Hz or equivalently x = 0). We choose T = 10 K\n(i.e. a = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 ), and vary the optical depth in the line center, \u03c40 = 104 , 105 , 106 , to be in the validity range of Neufeld's\nanalytic solution assuming a power-law absorption profile (Eq.\n6): a very optically thick slab, where a \u03c40 > (a \u03c40 )crit (cf. below). In this case the emergent Ly\u03b1 line profile is given by (see\nNeufeld 1990, Eq. 2.24):\n\u221a\n1\n6 x2\n.\n(20)\nJ(\u03c40 , x) =\np\n\u221a\n24 \u03c0 a\u03c40 cosh[ \u03c03 /54(|x3 |/a\u03c40 )]\n\n(21)\n\nAs expected, the more optically thick the medium is, the\nmore separated are the peaks. The width of the peaks becomes\nlarger with larger \u03c40 . In Fig. 1 we also show that computations\n2\n\nAs already mentioned above our definition of \u03c40 , the monochromatic line optical depth at x = 0 (line center), differs from Neufeld's\ndefinition of \u03c4Neuf\nwhich is the total,\n0\n\u221a i.e. frequency integrated, Ly\u03b1\noptical depth. One has: \u03c4Neuf\n= \u03c40 \u03c0.\n0\n\nWe now include dust in the slab and examine its effect on line\nprofiles and on Ly\u03b1 photon destruction.\nAs illustrated in Fig 3, the presence of dust absorption reduces the total Ly\u03b1 intensity. For the case of monochromatic\nradiation with a very small amount of dust shown here, the\nshape of the emerging Ly\u03b1 profile remains basically unchanged\nby dust. However, with increasing \u03c4dust , the inner parts of the\n\n\fVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\n7\n\nMonte-Carlo simulations of Hansen & Oh (2006). Our results\nare in good agreement with both of them.\n\n3.1.3. Continuous input spectrum\nThe case of a source emitting a pure continuum in a plane parallel slab with and without dust is discussed in Sect. 4.\n\n3.2. Expanding/infalling halos\n\nFig. 4. Escape fraction fe for Ly\u03b1 line photons emitted\nmonochromatically in a dusty slab as a function of (a\u03c40 )1/3 \u03c4a .\nThe excellent agreement between our simulation (crosses), the\ncomputations of Hansen & Oh (2006) and the approximate analytical solution of Neufeld (1990) given by Eq. 23 is shown.\nemission peaks are destroyed. Although not an observable, we\nalso plot the spectrum of the absorbed photons (red dotted line\non Fig 3). As expected, it is symmetric with respect to the line\ncenter: it presents two peaks, closer to the line center than those\nof the emerging profile. To understand these features, we have\nto take into account two competing effects, the large number\nof scatterings photons undergo in the line core favouring a potential interaction with dust, but the low probability to interact\nwith dust in presence of the very strong HI absorption cross\nsection close to the line core. Indeed, the probability to interact\nwith H is around unity in the core since\n\"\n#\u22121\n\u03c3H (0)\n\u2032 1/2 Md\n\u2248 1 + c T4\n,\n(22)\nPH (x = 0) =\nMd\nMH\n\u03c3d\n\u03c3H (0) + mndH M\nH\nwith c\u2032 = 3.3 10\u22126 K\u22121/2 for the dust parameters adopted here.\nTherefore none of the photons are absorbed by dust in the very\ncenter of the line. The peaks are located where the probability\nto interact with H is lower (for |x| < xc ) but where the number\nof interactions (which ultimately increase the chances for dust\nabsorption or scattering) is still high, i.e. on both sides of the\nline core.\nFor an optically thick slab (a\u03c40 > 103 ), Neufeld (1990)\ngave an analytic solution to determine the escape fraction, i.e.\nthe ratio between the number of photons which escape the\nmedium and the total number of emitted photons. This escape\nfraction fe depends on the combination (a\u03c40 )1/3 \u03c4a , where \u03c4a is\nthe optical depth of absorption from the center to the surface\nof the slab, i.e. \u03c4a = \u03c4d /2 here since we consider a dust albedo\nA \u223c 0.5. For a central source and in the limit (a\u03c40 )1/3 \u226b \u03c4a ,\nNeufeld (1990, his Eq. 4.43) has derived an approximate expression for fe , which, in our notation, is\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee \u221a\ni1/2 \uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n3 h\n(23)\nfe = 1/ cosh \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0 5/12 (a\u03c40 )1/3 \u03c4a \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\u03c0 \u03b6\n\nwhere \u03b6 \u2248 0.525 is a fitting parameter. In Fig. 4, we compare\nour results with this analytical curve and with the results from\n\nWe now simulate spherical clouds (\"halos\") of uniform density,\nnot only static, but also expanding or collapsing. An isotropic\nLy\u03b1 source is either located at the center of the sphere, or uniformly distributed over the whole volume. In this section, the\nangular redistribution considered is isotropic, after verification\nthat the emergent profiles are very similar, even in the cases\nwith motion.\n\n3.2.1. Monochromatic source\nWe first chose the same physical conditions as Zheng &\nMiralda-Escude (2002) and performed a run with a colunm\ndensity measured from the center to the edge of the cloud\nNH = 2. 1020 cm\u22122 , corresponding to a line-center optical depth\n\u03c40 = 8.3 106 and a temperature of 2. 104 K. The velocity field\nis a Hubble-type flow, V(r) = \u00b1Vmax r/Rmax , with Vmax = 200\nkm s\u22121 at the outer radius Rmax of the halo, and the positive\n(negative) sign corresponding to the expanding (infalling) halo.\nOur results, shown in Fig. 5, are in good agreement with those\nof Zheng & Miralda-Escude (2002). For static halos, the same\ncharacteristic double peak profile as for the static slab (cf. Fig.\n1) are obtained both for a uniform emissivity or for a central\npoint source. As shown by Djikstra & Haiman (2005a) the position of the peaks shows the same dependence as for the static\nslab (Eq. 21), but is given by x p = \u00b11.06(a\u03c40)1/3 for a\u03c40 > 103 .\nLy\u03b1 line profiles from an expanding or infalling halo are\nperfectly symmetric to each other (compare the red shortdashed and blue long-dashed curves on Fig. 5). Expanding halos present a red peak, whereas infalling halos have a blue one.\nHalos with a uniform emissivity (right panel in Fig. 5) show 1)\nbroader lines, 2) emission extending on both sides, and 3) a secondary peak on the blue (red) side for the expanding (infalling)\nhalo. The last feature is not visible on the plots of Zheng &\nMiralda-Escude (2002), but their resolution may be too low.\nHowever, the results of Dijkstra & Haiman (2005a) show this\nsecondary peak. We now briefly discuss the origin of these features.\nWhy are single peaks formed in expanding/infalling media\nwith a central point source emitting monochromatic radiation\nat the Ly\u03b1 line center? The reason is simple. The probability\nto escape the medium for a photon at line center is e\u2212\u03c40 , i.e.\nclose to zero for both cases shown here. As an expanding halo\ncontains atoms with velocities v(r) from 0 to Vmax , all photons\nin the frequency range x = [0, Vmax /b \u223c 11] will be seen in\nthe line center by atoms of the corresponding velocity, and are\nthus \"blocked\". Therefore the only possibility to escape is to be\nshifted to the red side. The symmetry of the double peak profile\n\n\f8\n\nVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\nFig. 5. Predicted Ly\u03b1 profiles of an isotropic and monochromatic source in uniform and isothermal spherical halos with a center\nto edge column density of NH = 2. 1020 cm\u22122 and T = 20000 K (i.e. b = 18.24 km s\u22121 ). Black solid lines show the Ly\u03b1 profiles\nfor a static halo, red short-dashed lines the expanding case with Vmax = 200 km s\u22121 , and blue long-dashed the infall case (same\nVmax ). Left: Central point source. Right: Uniform emissivity. On the right panel, the \"infalling\" spectrum has been decomposed\nin two components: the emergent spectrum from an \"inner part\" (the inner 50 % of the volume), resembling that from a halo\nwith a central source, and the one from the \"external part\" akin to the spectrum from an expanding shell where photons do not\nundergo backscatterings (cf. Fig. 12).\n\nFig. 6. Predicted Ly\u03b1 profiles of an isotropic and monochromatic source in uniform and isothermal spherically expanding halos\nwith varying column density (NH = 2. 1018 to 7. 1020 cm\u22122 as indicated in the Figure), and other parameters fixed to T = 20000\nK (i.e. b = 18.24 km s\u22121 ) and Vmax = 200 km s\u22121 . Left: Central point source. Right: Uniform emissivity.\nof the static case is \"broken\" in this way and transformed to a\nred peak for an expanding halo.\nThe increased line width in case of a spatially uniform\nemissivity (1) and the presence of photons on both the red and\nblue sides (2) is due to the fact that the intrinsic line emission (assumed at x = 0 in the atom's frame) spreads already\nover all frequencies from x = \u2212Vmax /b to +Vmax /b in the external (observer's) restframe. Radiation transfer effects further\nredistribute the photons in the wings. In fact, for the expanding halo, photons emerging with x > Vmax /b (i.e. very blue\nones) correspond to photons emitted close to the halo edge on\nthe approaching side, which have been further redshifted by\ndiffusion away from the line center (at x \u223c +Vmax /b in the observers frame). This naturally also produces the local minimum\nobserved at this frequency, which separates the secondary peak\n\nfrom the main one (point 3 above). This is easily verified by\nplotting e.g. the contributions from photons emitted in the \"external\" parts (i.e. close to the edge) and from \"internal\"regions,\nas shown in the right panel of Fig. 5. We chose as inner/outer\nlimit the radius which corresponds to an inner sphere and an\nouter shell of same volume. Therefore the location of this minimum is a measure of the external velocity of the halo, as already noticed by Dijkstra & Haiman (2005a), at least for ve\u22121\nlocities Vmax <\n\u223c 360 km s beyond which the two peaks start to\noverlap.\nWith Figs. 6 and 7, we investigate how the emergent lines\ndepend on column density and velocity gradient. When NH increases, the emission peak is shifted away from line center and\nbroadens out for both cases (central point source and uniform\nemissivity). Indeed, the optical depth at line center increases\n\n\fVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\nFig. 7. Predicted Ly\u03b1 profiles from an expanding halo with a\ncentral monochromatic source and varying velocity gradients\n(Vmax = 20, 200, and 2000 km s\u22121 ) for T = 20000 K (i.e.\nb = 18.24 km s\u22121 ) and NH = 2. 1020 cm\u22122 .\n\nwith NH , so Ly\u03b1 photons have to diffuse far in the wings to escape. From the right panel of Fig. 6 we note that the location\nof the flux minimum between the two peaks remains constant\nquite independently of NH . The behaviour for different velocity gradients, first discussed by Wehrse & Peraiah (1979),is the\nfollowing (cf. Fig. 7): from Vmax = 20 to 200 km s\u22121 one goes\nfrom a nearly static case (i.e. double peaks) to a broad asymmetric line, whose peak position is progressively displaced redwards. Above a certain value of the velocity gradient (or equivalently Vmax ), the peak position moves back closer to line center as the medium becomes more \"transparent\" there, given\nthe finite and constant column density. In any case, the extent of the red wing continues to increase with increasing Vmax .\nQualitatively the simulations shown in Figs. 6 and 7 resemble those of a cosmological Hubble flow (cf. Loeb & Rybicky\n1999) although modified by a finite outer boundary.\nFor test purposes we have also compared the surface brightness profiles with the results of Zheng & Miralda-Escude\n(2002), and find a good agreement.\n\n9\n\nwhereas the absorption feature behaves inversely. The latter\nbehaviour is due to a partial \"replenishment\" of the absorption feature by the \"secondary peak\" discussed above for the\nmonochromatic radiation. Also shown in Fig. 8 is how the presence of dust changes the observed line profile: as dust absorption is efficient in the wings close to (but not at) line center (cf.\nSect. 3.1.2) it easily suppresses the emission peak and broadens the absorption feature leading to an asymmetric absorption\nprofile with a more strongly damped red (blue) wing for an infalling (expanding) halo.\nFar from the line center, the escape fraction, i.e. the ratio\nbetween the number of photons which escape the medium in\none frequency bin and the number of photons emitted in this\nfrequency bin, follows the expected exponential law fe = e\u2212\u03c4a ,\nwhere \u03c4a is the dust absorption optical depth. Indeed, when the\ninfluence of hydrogen scattering becomes negligible, photons\nare be absorbed by dust with the probability P = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4a .\nTo illustrate the variety of line profiles predicted for various intrinsic line strengths, we show in Fig. 9 the case of an expanding halo with uniform emissivity. As seen from this figure,\na family of line profiles with intermediate cases between a pure\ncontinuum (cf. Fig. 8) and pure line emission (Fig. 5) is obtained with increasing intrinsic Ly\u03b1 equivalent width W(Ly\u03b1).\nNote that for a sufficiently large W(Ly\u03b1) the secondary peak becomes again visible. Also, remember that for the case of opposite movement, i.e. infalling, the predicted spectrum is identical\nexcept for a change of red and blue frequencies (i.e. change x\nto \u2212x).\nOverall, as we have seen, there are several degeneracies\nwhich make it difficult if not impossible to determine physical parameters such as NH and Vmax for cases of expanding or\ninfalling halos. This is in particular complicated by the lack of\na priori knowledge of the spatial distribution of the emissivity and of the precise velocity field. For a sufficiently extended\nLy\u03b1 emissivity it may be possible to determine the outer velocity, Vmax , from a local minimum of the flux in the blue part of\nthe line profile, as already pointed out by Dijkstra & Haiman\n(2005a). However, detecting this feature would require a fairly\nhigh signal to noise. Furthermore this blue side of the Ly\u03b1 profile may be altered by intervening IGM absorption components\nat slightly lower redshifts.\n\n3.2.2. Continuous input spectrum plus a line and dust\nConsidering a source spectrum with a pure continuum and\nvarying amounts of dust yields the following for the same conditions considered before(see Fig. 8). Due to the scattering nature of Ly\u03b1, the continuum photons are removed from line center and redistributed in the wings leading to a P-Cygni type profile with a red emission and blue absorption in the expanding\nmedium, and an inverted P-Cygni profile in the infalling case.\nIn other words, a flat source spectrum can result in a complex\nline profile.\nThe peak is located at the same frequency as in the\nmonochromatic case with identical physical conditions, and\nthe absorption feature is around x = Vmax /b. Again its location indicates the external velocity of the medium. The emission peak is broader for uniform emissivity than for a central\npoint source, as already discussed in the monochromatic case,\n\n4. On the formation of damped Ly\u03b1 absorption\nprofiles\nAs damped Ly\u03b1 profiles are frequently observed and pure Voigt\nabsorption line profiles often used to fit components of Ly\u03b1 it\nis of interest to examine under which conditions actually pure\n(damped or non-damped) Ly\u03b1 absorption line profiles are expected.\nTo illustrate the point, and the non-trivial problem of Ly\u03b1\nradiation transfer effects we show in Fig. 10 the predicted spectrum around Ly\u03b1 for an infinite slab illuminated uniformly in\nthe central plane by a pure continuum source. Indeed from the\ndiscussion of the previous cases it is not surprising to find a\ndouble peaked emission profile with a deep central absorption,\nas shown for the case without dust. Adding already quite small\namounts of dust allows one to destroy the emission peaks and\n\n\f10\n\nVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\nFig. 8. Left: Line profiles for an expanding halo with a central monochromatic source showing the variety of profiles from PCygni to somewhat asymmetric damped profiles. Right: Infalling halo with a uniformly distributed emissivity showing profiles\nfrom inverted P-Cygni to less broad absorption. In both panels the adopted conditions are the following: NH = 2. 1020 cm\u22122 ,\nT = 20000 K, and Vmax = 200 km s\u22121 . The line profiles are shown for dust amounts corresponding to: (Md /MH , \u03c4a ) = (0., 0.),\n(8. 10\u22124, 0.1), (4. 10\u22123, 0.5), (8. 10\u22123, 1.).\n\nFig. 9. Predicted Ly\u03b1 line profiles from an expanding halo\nwith uniformly distributed sources emitting a flat continuum\nplus a monochromatic line (at Ly\u03b1 line center) with different equivalent widths. The physical conditions in the halo are:\nNH = 2. 1020 cm\u22122 , T = 2 \u00d7 104 K, Vmax = 200 km s\u22121 , and\nno dust. The Ly\u03b1 line equivalent width, given in units of the\nDoppler width \u2206\u03bdD , increases from 0 to \u221e from the top-left\ncorner to the bottom-right.\nto create Voigt-like absorption profiles, as also shown on Fig.\n10. All these profiles can be seen as the sum of two components: first photons which have not undergone any interaction\nin the slab leading to a Voigt profile, added to the usual doublepeaked profile arising from photons which scattered in the slab.\nThe latter one becomes less important when the amount of dust\nincreases (for a fixed NH ) and/or when NH increases (for a\nfixed dust-to-gas ratio). Hence the resulting profile approaches\na Voigt profile. However, one should notice that the column\ndensity derived from Voigt-profile fitting to these predicted profiles can be several times smaller than the \"true\" column density in the simulation. For example, for the most dusty simula-\n\ntion (green long-dashed curve) from Fig. 10 the Voigt profile\nyields a good fit (in the sense of a reduced \u03c72 \u223c 1.02), and the\nbest fit column density is a factor \u223c 3.1 lower than the \"true\"\ninput value.\nThe reason for this apparently \"strange\" behaviour is simply due to the fact that the predicted spectrum is computed\nhere from all the emergent photons integrated over the whole\nobject and over all emergent directions, i.e. it corresponds to\nan integrated spectrum of a symmetric object (e.g. the sphere\nwith a central source) or of a sufficiently extended \"screen\"\nbetween us and the source. In this case we include all photons,\nsome of which have undergone a complex scattering history before emerging toward the observer. Therefore the double-peak,\ncharacteristic of static media is unavoidable without dust and\nthe only way to \"destroy\" them is by adding dust.\nConsidering different geometries such as a finite slab, or a\nsphere of the same center-to-edge optical depth and same temperature yields exactly the same line profiles as the infinite slab.\nThe \"implicit\" geometrical assumptions made above for the\nconstruction of an integrated spectrum are unlikely to be applicable to the typical damped Ly\u03b1 systems (DLAs) observed in\nspectra of distant galaxies and quasars. These cases are better\nidealised by a small (in angular size) intervening cloud between\nthe background source and the observer, which diffuses basically all photons out of the line of sight. In other words photons far from the line center will simply travel freely through\nthe cloud, but when the photon frequency x is close to the line\ncenter, the probability to cross the medium without interaction, exp(\u2212\u03c40 H(x, a)), is considerably reduced. Since photons\nwhich interact with the medium have basically no chance to\nbe re-emitted along the same line of sight (compare the observer solid angle with 4\u03c0), they will be lost for the observer.\nTherefore the observed profile is simply that of a pure absorption line described by the Voigt absorption line profile,\nnamely I(x) = I0 exp(\u2212\u03c40 H(x, a)), reflecting the properties of\nthe medium, i.e. the total column density and the temperature.\n\n\fVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\nFig. 10. Emergent Ly\u03b1 profiles for varying amounts of dust predicted for a slab with an isotropic source in the center emitting\na flat continuum. The conditions of the medium are: \u03c40 = 104 ,\nT = 10 K. In this static configuration, the two angular redistributions are equivalent; spectra have been obtained with the\nisotropic redistribution. The line profiles are shown for absorption dust optical depths of \u03c4a = 0. (no dust), 0.1, 0.5, 1. from\ntop to bottom. Note the double-peak profile plus central absorption characteristic of a static medium for no dust. Already small\namounts of dust are able to suppress the peaks, thereby leading\nto Voigt-like profiles. However, in such geometrical configurations, classical Voigt-profile fitting will underestimate the true\nHI column density. See text for more explanations.\n\nWe simulated this configuration, and the resulting spectrum is presented on Fig 11, by the black curve. We checked\nagain that a spheric cloud or a slab perpendicular to the line\nof sight, with the same optical depth and temperature, lead\nexactly to the same observed spectrum. For reasons of calculation time, we considered a relatively small column density,\nNH = 2 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 . The temperature is set to T = 100K. As\nexpected, the simulation is perfectly fitted by a theoretical Voigt\nprofile (red dotted curve). Also plotted on the same graph is the\nreflected spectrum (blue curve), composed of photons which\nescaped the medium by the side they entered.\nPhotons which are not \"reflected\", i.e. backscattered to the\nsource will diffuse in the medium and finally escape after a\nlarge number of scatterings forming the \"diffuse spectrum\".\nFor obvious reasons this spectrum, shown by the green curve,\npresents the same shape as the emergent spectrum from a slab\nwith an isotropic source in the center, i.e. two symmetrical\npeaks. In dust-free cases with a flat incident continuum source,\nthe transmitted spectrum will be the opposite of the reflected +\ndiffuse spectrum, as all Ly\u03b1 photons are conserved.\nIn short, to form pure symmetric Ly\u03b1 absorption line profiles from a flat continuum source requires specific geometrical\nconfigurations allowing the photons to diffuse out of the line\nof sight. An alternative way to achieve such profiles, e.g. in\nan integrated spectrum of an embedded source, is by invoking\nthe presence of dust which destroys the double emission peaks\notherwise present. However, in such a case the apparent column\n\n11\n\nFig. 11.

The directly, i.e. perpendicularly, transmitted flux yields the expected Voigt profile (red\ndotted line). The diffuse (scattered) light shows again the double peak profile as the slab with a central source.\ndensity derived from simple Voigt profile fitting underestimates\nthe true value of NH due to radiation transfer effects.\n\n5. Ly\u03b1 transfer in expanding dust-free and dusty\nshells revisited\nThere are numerous indications, both theoretically and observationally, for the presence of expanding shells and bubbles in\nstarbursts. It is therefore important to simulate such geometrical configurations to examine both qualitatively and quantitatively the diversity of Ly\u03b1 line profiles and to gain basic insight\ninto the physical processes shaping them.\nOur model of an expanding homogeneous shell is described\nby the following parameters: an inner and outer radius Rmin and\nRmax respectively, a uniform radial expansion velocity Vexp , the\nradial colunm density NH , and a constant temperature T given\nby the Doppler b parameter (Eq. 3). The interior of the shell\nis assumed to be empty, the isotropic Ly\u03b1/continuum emitting\nsource located at the center. In contrast to the geometrical configurations discussed earlier, emergent profiles from expanding\nshells are sensitive to the angular redistribution. Therefore the\ndipolar redistribution is taken into account to treat the Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer consistently in this case, and all spectra shown\nin this section have been obtained using the dipolar redistribution in the code. The main parameters determining the Ly\u03b1\nphoton escape and hence the line profile are Vexp , NH , b, and\nthe dust-to-gas ratio Md /MH , as shown below. The precise values of the shell radii and thickness, setting the geometrical size\nand curvature, are secondary.\nBelow we shall examine the following cases: The academic\ncases of a source with monochromatic emission and shells both\nwithout and with dust. These first two cases are essential to un-\n\n\f12\n\nVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n1c\n\n1b\n\n3\n\n1a,2\n\nFig. 12.

The different shapes can be\ndescribed with the number of back-scatterings photons undergo : bumps 1a and 2 are built-up with photons which didn't undergo\nany backscattering, the highest peak located at x = \u22122Vexp /b (feature 1b) is composed of photons which undergo exactly one\nbackscattering, and the red tail 1c is made of photons which undergo two or more backscatterings. See text for more details.\nRight: Scheme of an expanding shell showing the origin of photons of different groups. The observer is on the left side, at\ninfinity.\nderstand more realistic simulations allowing for arbitrary input\nspectra (including continuum and/or Ly\u03b1 line emission), again\ndust-free or with dust, discussed subsequently.\n\n5.1. Monochromatic emission and dust-free shells\n5.1.1. Basic line profile formation mechanism\nFirst we discuss the emergent Ly\u03b1 spectrum from a dust-free\nexpanding shell with the following parameters: Vexp = 300 km\ns\u22121 , NH = 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , b = 40 km s\u22121 (i.e. \u03c40 = 3.8 \u00d7 106 ),\nRmin = 0.9Rmax , and Rmax = 1.17 \u00d7 1019 cm. For monochromatic Ly\u03b1 photons emitted at line center the resulting line profile is shown on the left panel of Fig 12 (solid black line).\nQualitatively this line profile and others shown below exhibit\nthe following characteristic features, marked on the figure and\nillustrated on the right panel:\n1abc) an extended redshifted emission with one or two\n\"bumps\" (1a and 1b) and a red tail (1c) \u2013 all at x < 0 (i.e.\nred side of Ly\u03b1),\n2) a smaller blue bump (at x > 0), and\n3) an narrow emission peak at the line center (x = 0).\nAlthough we considered the same physical conditions as Ahn\net al. (2003, their Fig. 2), features 2) and 3) are not apparent in\ntheir simulations (cf. also Ahn 2004). However, these features\nare also found in the simulations of Hansen & Oh (2006) and\nthe origin of all of them is well understood, as we shall now\ndiscuss. To do so it is instructive to group the emergent photons and to distinguish the emergent line profiles according to\nthe number backscatterings they have undergone (see left panel\non Fig. 12). A photon is said to \"backscatter\" when it travels\nacross the empty interior before re-entering the shell at a different location3 (see right panel of Fig. 12). Note, that any such\n3\n\nThis definition is equivalent to the one used by Ahn et al. (2003).\n\ntravel is counted as a backscattering, irrespective of its precise\ndirection/length. In particular this does not necessarily imply a\nhemisphere change for the photon.\nFeatures 1a and 2: photons with zero backscattering. In\nthis simulation all photons are emitted at line center (x = 0) at\nthe center of the shell. Once a photon reaches the shell for the\nfirst time it is seen redshifted to \u2212xCMF (Vexp ) = \u22127.5 by the H\natoms (in the comoving frame, CMF). A fraction of the photons\nwill diffuse progressively through the shell towards the exterior\nand escape without backscattering (solid lines on the left panel\nof Fig. 12). Their spectrum (marked as 0 backscattering) gives\nrise to an asymmetric double peak with a small blue component\ncentered at x2 \u223c 10 (feature 2 above) from photons escaping\nthe blue wing of Ly\u03b1 in the (blueshifted) shell approaching the\nobserver, and a somewhat redshifted stronger peak at x1a \u223c \u22125\n(bump 1a above) corresponding to the photons escaping the\nred Ly\u03b1 wing in the blueshifted shell. Qualitatively this part\nof the spectrum is equivalent to the spectrum of a slab with\na constant receding macroscopic velocity with respect to the\nemitting source (see Neufeld 1990, Fig. 6).\nFeature 3: direct escape. For sufficiently small column\ndensities and/or large expansion velocities, a non-zero fraction of photons traverses directly the shell without interacting.\nThis case appears with the probability e\u2212\u03c4exp (0) , where \u03c4exp (x) =\n\u03c4(x \u2212 x(Vexp )) is the reduced Ly\u03b1 optical depth seen by a photon with observers frequency x due to Doppler shift of Vexp . For\nthe case discussed here \u03c4exp (0) = \u03c4(\u22127.5) = 6.09, so that 0.25\n% of the photons will escape without interacting. These photons give raise to feature 3 in the bin at x3 = 0 labeled in Fig.\n12. The importance of these direct photons increases of course\nwith increasing Vexp and decreasing column density, as seen in\nFigs. 14 and 16. Before comparison with observed spectra this\npeaked flux contribution must obviously be convolved with the\ninstrumental resolution.\n\n\fVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\nFeatures 1b and 1c: photons undergoing one or more\nbackscattering. Let us now examine the situation after one\nscattering in the expanding shell. After the first scattering the\nfrequency distribution of the photons in the external frame is\nshown by the black solid line on Fig. 13. As the photons are\ninitially seen by the atoms at the frequency \u2212x(Vexp ), i.e. in the\nwings, they are basically re-emitted at the same frequency in\nthe atoms frame. Depending on their emission direction this\nleads to a range of frequencies in the observer frame reaching\nfrom x \u223c \u22122x(Vexp ) to 0, with more photons re-emitted in the\nabsorption direction (around x \u223c \u22122x(Vexp )) or in the opposite\ndirection (x \u223c 0) because of the dipolar angular redistribution\n(the frequency distribution for isotropic redistribution would be\nnearly a square profile over x \u223c [\u22122x(Vexp ), 0]). Which of these\nphotons are now able to escape the medium after just one scattering is represented by the blue dotted histogram.\nOverall, depending on their frequency being in one of the 3\nspectral regions indicated in Fig. 13, the fate of the photons is\nas follows.\n\u2013 Frequency range 1: Photons with a frequency xobs \u223c 0 cannot escape the medium: they are emitted outward in the radial direction with a frequency too close to the line center\n(in the atoms frame). Their escape probability is negligible.\n\u2013 Range 2: Around xobs \u223c \u22127.5, although their frequency is\nfar from line center, no photons escape the medium for geometrical reasons: their emission direction is perpendicular\nto the radial direction increasing thus strongly the geometrical path and the optical depth.\n\u2013 Range 3: Most of the photons escape with a frequency\nxobs <\n\u223c \u22129 since their frequency is very far from line center,\nand their emission direction is convenient: they cross the inner part of the shell (backscattering), and when they arrive\non the other side, the combination of their frequency and\ndirection with the local macroscopic motion favours their\nescape. The frequency distribution function after one scattering shows that the number of photons re-emitted with a\nfrequency x < \u22122x(Vexp ) decreases very rapidly. Therefore\nthe photons escaping after just one scattering already show\na peak close to the frequency corresponding to twice the\nexpansion velocity. So a peak of escaping photons centered\nat the frequency x = \u22122x(Vexp ) appears.\nPhotons undergoing further scatterings will be absorbed\nagain, and the escape of those re-emitted around \u22122x(Vexp )\nwill be favoured again for same reasons. This explains why\nthe most prominent feature (1b) in the red part is located at\nx1b \u223c \u22122x(Vexp ), measuring therefore twice the shell velocity.\nPhotons undergoing progressively more scatterings will show\na broadening frequency distribution compared to that after one\nscattering. The broadening of its red wing is responsible for\nthe last feature (1c) made of photons escaping after 2 or more\nbackscatterings.\n\n5.1.2. Dependence on shell parameters\nAnother way to understand the different features of the emergent Ly\u03b1 line profile of an expanding shell is by varying the\n\n13\n\nFig. 13.

Let us examine how the spectrum depends on the\nexpansion velocity Vexp , on the thermal and turbulent velocities intervening in the Doppler parameter b, and on the colunm\ndensity NH .\nFor increasing expansion velocities, and starting from the\nstatic case with a symmetric double peak profile (cf. above\nand Eq. B18 of Dijkstra & Haiman 2005a for a static sphere),\nthe imbalance between the red part and the blue part grows\n(see Fig. 14): progressively more photons escape from the red\npart of the line because atoms see them already redshifted (red\ndashed curve) at the first interaction. The probability to be reemitted in the line core is then smaller than the one to \"remain\"\nin the wing. Hence the growing asymmetry between red and\nblue. Note also the appearance of excess flux at line center for\nthe curve with the highest Vexp in Fig. 14. The appearance and\nstrength of this feature (x3 = 0, feature 3) is consistent with the\nincreasing direct escape probability.\n\n\f14\n\nVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\nFig. 15. Dependence of the predicted Ly\u03b1 profiles from an expanding shell with a central monochromatic source on the Doppler\nparameter b. As the characteristic unit of Ly\u03b1 radiative transfer problem, x, depends on the Doppler parameter b(cf. Eq. 4), a\nvariation of b will lead to a change of x too. To compare cases with different b, we show the usual plot in x units but also a plot\nin velocity. Left: Plot in Dopper units x, Right: Plot in velocity along the line of sight vobs .\nFor a given b, the red part is a single peak, for small enough\nvalues of Vexp (e.g. Vexp < 200 km s\u22121 for b = 40 km s\u22121 ). In\nfact, the two contributions of photons undergoing zero and one\nbackscattering are then too close to be distinguished, and the\ntwo corresponding red peaks (features 1a and 1b) are mixed.\nThe same trend is found for large values of b, as shown in the\nleft panel of Fig. 15. More precisely, predicted Ly\u03b1 profiles\nfrom an expanding shell present only one red peak for sufficiently small Vexp /b. With increasing Vexp or decreasing b, the\nblue part (feature 2) becomes very faint, and almost all photons\nescape in the red part, presenting two well separated peaks. In\nall cases, and quite independently of b (cf. Fig. 15, left), the\nsecond and most prominent peak (feature 1b) traces twice the\nexpansion velocity as already discussed above. It is essentially\ncomposed of photons which undergo one backscattering, while\nthe first peak (feature 1a) is made of photons undergoing no\nbackscattering. Note, however, that in contrast to the appearance in this plot, the position of main peak is independent of b\nin observed spectra, as illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 15.\nThis is simply due to the definition of x, which depends on b.\nVarying the column density (leaving the other parameters\nunchanged) has the following effects (see Fig 16). First, the\nflux excess at x3 = 0, i.e. the fraction of photons which can escape the shell without interacting, decreases exponentially with\nincreasing NH . Second, the relative importance of the two red\npeaks (1a, 1b) changes: with increasing column density the first\npeak (feature 1a) decreases with respect to the second one (1b),\nwhereas the red wing (1c) is enhanced, since the importance of\nbackscattering increases. For sufficiently large NH the first peak\n(1a) disappears completely, whereas the red tail (1c) becomes\nas important as the mean peak (1b).\nIn short, the imbalance between blue and red emission increases with increasing Vexp /b. The separation between the\nmultiple peaks formed on the red side of the Ly\u03b1 profile becomes progressively less clear (i.e. the peaks merge together)\nfor lower expansion velocities, and/or higher temperature or\nturbulent velocities. For sufficiently large H \uf769 column densities\n\nFig. 16. Dependence of the predicted Ly\u03b1 profiles from an expanding shell with a central monochromatic source on the column density.\n20\n\u22122\n(NH >\n\u223c 10 cm ) the main red emission peak measures quite\nwell 2Vexp .\n\n5.2. Monochromatic emission and dusty shells\nIn Fig. 17 we present the influence of dust on the emergent\nspectrum from the expanding shell studied above (Fig 12).\nWhen \u03c4a increases, the relative height of the two red peaks\n(features 1a and 1b) is reversed: in dust-free media the prominent peak is 1b, but when dust is present 1a becomes as high\nas 1b. In the most dusty cases, corresponding to a destruction\nof \u223c 93% of Ly\u03b1 photons, one notes a loss of photons from\nthe the blue bump (feature 2 on Fig. 12) and from the red tail\n(feature 1c on Fig 12). This is easily understood as these features are composed of photons undergoing a very large number\nof scattering, which increases their chance to be absorbed by\ndust. Qualitatively our results show the same behaviour as the\noutflowing shell with holes or clumps modeled by Hansen &\n\n\fVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\nFig. 17. Predicted emergent Ly\u03b1 profiles from an expanding\nshell with a monochromatic central source with a column density NH = 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , an expansion velocity Vexp = 300\nkm s\u22121 a Doppler parameter b = 40 km s\u22121 , and different dust\nabsorption optical depths \u03c4a =0., 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0. The area\nunder each curve is normalised to unity, i.e. corrected for photon destruction by dust, to highlight the relatively minor line\nprofile changes. The blue bump (2) and the red tail (1c) are\nmore destroyed by dust than other features. Overall the profile\nis globally preserved, but somewhat \"sharpened\".\n\nOh (2006): strongly redshifted photons are suppressed by dust,\nwhereas the spectral peaks are still visible. The result is a somewhat \"sharpened\" line profile. Although this overall \"sharpening\" trend is also found in the earlier simulations of Ahn (2004)\nour results differ quite strongly from theirs, as already mentioned above.\nWe now quantify the Ly\u03b1 photon destruction by dust and\nits dependence on the shell and dust parameters. For illustration we have chosen similar conditions as those discussed by\nAhn (2004), namely a shell with an inner and outer radius\nRmin = 0.9Rmax , an expansion velocity Vexp = 200 km s\u22121 , a H \uf769\ncolumn density between NH = 1019 and 1021 cm\u22122 , a Doppler\nparameter of b = 20, 40, and 80 km s\u22121 , and a monochromatic\ncentral point source. In contrast to Ahn (2004) we assume that\nthere is no dust inside the bubble, i.e. at R < Rmin , as most of\nthe dust is probably destroyed there. Furthermore, the presence\nof dust inside the shell is not compatible with inferences from\nthe empirical Calzetti attenuation law (see e.g. Gordon, Calzetti\n& Witt 2003). The predicted Ly\u03b1 escape fraction as a function\nof the dust absorption optical depth \u03c4a measuring, for a given\nNH column density, different dust-to-gas amounts, is shown in\nFig. 18.\nAs expected, the main dependence of the escape fraction\nfe is on NH and \u03c4a . Due to the multiple resonant scattering of\nLy\u03b1 photons on hydrogen and the concomitant increase of the\nphoton path length, fe is considerably smaller than the simple\ndust absorption probability exp(\u2212\u03c4a ), and the escape fraction\ndecreases strongly with increasing NH .\nIn an expanding shell the Ly\u03b1 photon destruction by dust\ndepends also to some extent on the gas temperature (or on the\nDoppler parameter b), although in a somewhat \"subtle\" way as\n\n15\n\nFig. 18. Escape fraction of Ly\u03b1 photons from an expanding\nshell with Vexp =200 km s\u22121 for different column densities (NH =\n1019 , 1020 , 1021 cm\u22122 ) and for different Doppler parameters\n(b =20, 40 and 80 km s\u22121 ).\n\ncan be seen from Fig. 18. Indeed, for large column densities\n(here NH > 1020 ) fe is found to depend little on b, for intermediate values of NH \u223c 1020 the escape fraction varies in a nonmonotonous way with b, and for lower NH values fe decreases\nwith increasing b. This latter behaviour is opposite to the one\nin a static medium, where the escape fraction increases with b\n(cf. Fig. 4 or Eq. 23 with a \u221d b\u22121 and \u03c40 \u221d b\u22121 ). The reason for\nthis inverted dependence is basically due to the fact that in an\nexpanding shell the quantity Vexp /b determines the frequency\nat which the initially emitted photons are seen by the atoms in\nthe receding shell. For increasing b, Vexp /b decreases, so that\nphotons reaching the shell are seen with a frequency closer to\nline center. Hence they will diffuse more and will have a higher\nprobability to be absorbed by dust. On the contrary, when b decreases, photons are seen in the wings, their chance to interact\nwith dust decreases and so does fe . When they are sufficiently\nfar from line center (Vexp /b \u226b xc , where xc is some critical\nfrequency), the shell becomes transparent in Ly\u03b1 and the escape fraction approaches the minimum value given by the dust\nabsorption probability exp\u2212\u03c4a (red upper curve on Fig. 18).\n\n5.3. Dust-free and dusty shells with arbitrary source\nspectra\nNow we present the emergent spectrum from an expanding\nshell when the input spectrum is a flat continuum and with\ndifferent amounts of dust. In Fig. 19, the black solid line represents the emergent spectrum from a dust-free shell. It is a\nP-Cygni profile, quite similar to the expanding halo with a central point source in Fig. 8. Again, Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer leads\nto the appearance of an emission peak and an absorption feature in the emergent profile which did not exist in the input\nspectrum. The first remark is that this spectrum is less complex\nthan in the monochromatic case: there is only one red peak,\nand no blue bump, due to radiation transfer of photons at all\nfrequencies. The emission peak is located at x \u223c \u22122x(Vexp ), as\nthe highest peak of the monochromatic spectrum, and the ab-\n\n\f16\n\nVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\nstrength, we show in Fig. 20 a family of emergent spectra with\nintermediate cases between intrinsic pure continuum (cf. Fig.\n19) and intrinsic monochromatic emission (cf. Fig. 12). For a\nsufficiently large Ly\u03b1 equivalent width W(Ly\u03b1), the second red\npeak (feature 1a), the small excess at x = 0 (feature 3) and the\nblue bump (referred to as feature 2) become clearly visible.\n\n6.

Predicted Ly\u03b1 profiles for an expanding shell for a central source emitting a flat continuum and with different amounts\nof dust. The adopted conditions are the following: NH = 2. 1020\ncm\u22122 , T = 10000 K, b = 40 km s\u22121 , and Vexp = 300 km s\u22121 .\nThe line profiles are shown for dust amounts corresponding to\n(Md /MH , \u03c4a ) = (0., 0.), (8. 10\u22124, 0.1), (4. 10\u22123, 0.5), (8. 10\u22123,\n1.).\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\nFig. 20. Predicted Ly\u03b1 profiles from an expanding shell with a\ncentral source emitting a flat continuum plus a monochromatic\nline (at Ly\u03b1 line center) with different equivalent widths. The\nphysical conditions in the shell are: a H \uf769 column density NH i =\n2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , a temperature T = 104 K, a Doppler parameter\nb = 40 km s\u22121 , no dust, and a radial velocity of Vexp = 300\nkm s\u22121 . The Ly\u03b1 line equivalent width, given in units of the\nDoppler width \u2206\u03bdD , increases from 0 to \u221e from the top-left to\nthe bottom-right panel.\n\nsorption is around x \u223c x(Vexp ), as this frequency corresponds to\nthe line center frequency in the shell frame. The effect of dust is\nsimilar to Fig. 8 for spherical halos: it suppresses the emission\npeak and broadens the absorption, leading to an asymmetric\nabsorption profile. The fraction of escaping photons far from\nthe line center is equal to exp(\u2212\u03c4a ), as expected (see discussion\nsection 3.2.2).\nTo illustrate the variety of emergent line profiles from\na dust-free expanding shell when varying the intrinsic line\n\nFor a better overview over the different simulations presented\nhere and the resulting variety of Ly\u03b1 line profiles, and for a first\nqualitative comparison with observations we present a summary in Table 1.\nSchematically we may classify the emergent Ly\u03b1 profiles\nand considered geometries in the three following main groups,\n1) static media and symmetric profiles, 2) expanding/infalling\nhalos, and 3) expanding shells, which we shall discuss now.\n\n6.1. Static media, symmetric profiles\nFor simple static geometries with an embedded source emitting\na symmetric spectrum around x = 0 (i.e. monochromatic line\nradiation, a symmetric line centered on the Ly\u03b1 in the restframe\nof the medium, or a flat continuum) the emergent Ly\u03b1 line profile remains symmetric with two peaks, whose position is given\nby x p \u2248 \u00b1(0.9 \u2212 1) \u00d7 (a\u03c40 )1/3 and little or no flux at line center\n(case 1 in Table 1; cf. Neufeld 1990, Hansen & Oh 2006). The\ndetailed line shape (FWHM of each part, the possible presence\nof \"bumps\" etc.) depends on the properties of the scattering\nmedium in ways quantified in detail by Neufeld (1990) and examined also by Richling (2003) for clumpy media. Breaking\nthe symmetry of the source spectrum or introducing velocity\nshifts between the source and the scattering medium lead to\nasymmetric profiles, as well known (cf. Neufeld 1990).\nEmission peaks superposed to a continuum \u2013 e.g. from a\nsource with a pure continuum or continuum plus line emission\n\u2013 are easily \"destroyed\" in presence of dust (case 2). In this\ncase the resulting profile is close to a Voigt profile. However,\ndue to radiation transfer effects and the assumed geometry and\n\"aperture\", an integrated line profile fit in this manner will underestimate the true value of the column density.\nPurely or close to symmetric Ly\u03b1 line profiles are quite\nrarely observed. E.g. the spectra of the Ly\u03b1 blob LAB2 at\nz \u223c 3.09 of Steidel et al. (2000) observed by Wilman et al.\n(2005), Ly\u03b1 emitters around a radio galaxy (Venemans et al.\n2005), or two LBG in the FORS Deep Field (Tapken 2005)\ncome close to this, and may hence be related to static (or\nclose to) media. For LAB2, however, other explanations have\nbeen put forward by Wilman et al. (2005) and Dijkstra et al.\n(2005b) including outflows + \"absorbing screens\" and intergalactic medium (IGM) inflow.\nSome nearby starbursts such as I Zw 18 and SBS 0335-052\nshow bf \"Voigt-like\" profiles (cf. Kunth et al. 1994, Thuan &\nIzotov 1997, Mas-Hesse et al. 2003). If related to a continuous\nsource embedded in an H \uf769 cloud (case 2), such profiles can\nbe reproduced with sufficient dust. In this case the H \uf769 column\n\n\fVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\n17\n\nTable 1.

(2004)\n\ndensity derived from simple Voigt profile fitting would underestimate the true value. Other configurations can, however, also\nlead to the same profiles. To clarify such ambiguities, a detailed\nanalysis taking all known constraints into account will be necessary.\nA static medium illuminated by a distant background continuum source (case 3) produces well known Voigt absorption line profiles, e.g. seen as damped Ly\u03b1 absorbers (DLA).\nIn such a geometry Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer effects need not be\nconsidered. A case of \"Ly\u03b1 fluorescence\" of QSO radiation\non a nearby absorbing system has been observed recently by\nAdelberger et al. (2005): they detected a double-peaked emission superimposed on a DLA profile. This can be related to our\ndiffuse spectrum illustrated in Fig 11.\n\n6.2. Expanding/infalling halos\nAs already discussed by Zheng & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 (2002) and\nDijkstra et al. (2005a) for monochromatic sources emitting at\nline center, such geometries give rise to asymmetric profiles\nwith a redshifted (blueshifted) main peak for expanding (infalling) matter, and eventually secondary features (case 4). The\nposition of the main peak shows the same dependence as for a\nHubble outflow (Loeb & Rybicky 1999): it moves away from\nline center with increasing NH and decreasing velocity Vmax . In\nthe case of uniform emissivity, the positions of the secondary\npeak and the point of minimal flux indicate the external velocity (see Fig. 8 in Dijkstra et al. 2005a).\nFor sources emitting a pure continuum, the Ly\u03b1 radiation\ntransfer leads to normal (inverted) P-Cygni profiles for expanding (infalling) halos. Again, as for static media, the presence of\ndust is able to destroy the emission peak leading then to absorption line profiles with more or less pronounced asymmetries\n(case 5).\nDijkstra et al. (2005b) have argued for possible infalling\nLy\u03b1 halos in the case of the Ly\u03b1 blob LAB2 of Steidel et al.\n\n(2000), and of a z = 5.78 galaxy discovered by Bunker et\nal. (2003). Numerous LBGs and LAEs show asymmetric redshifted Ly\u03b1 profiles, which could in principle be related to expanding halos. To distinguish this geometry from expanding\nshells or other geometries additional observational constraints\nare needed. For z \u223c 3 LBGs, for example, expanding shells\nprovide a good description, as we'll discuss now.\n\n6.3. Expanding shells\nEmergent Ly\u03b1 profiles from an expanding shell can be rather\ncomplex: from P-Cygni profiles or asymmetric absorption profiles for an intrinsic continuum spectrum (case 7) to emission\nline profiles made of one (or two) red peaks and possibly a\nfainter blue bump for an intrinsically monochromatic (line)\nspectrum (case 6). In all cases the profiles show an asymmetric\nred wing related to Ly\u03b1 scattering in the outflowing medium.\nWhen Ly\u03b1 is in emission, the velocity shift of the main peak\nof the red part of the profile corresponds to velocities between\nVexp and \u223c 2Vexp , where Vexp is the expansion velocity of the\n20\n\u22122\nshell. For column densities NH >\n\u223c 10 cm the main red emission peak measures quite accurately twice the shell velocity.\nInterestingly, spectroscopic observations of Lyman break\ngalaxies (LBG) at z \u223c 3 agree very well with the expectations\nfor an expanding shell geometry. Indeed the composite spectra\nof the large LBG samples of Shapley et al. (2003) show not\nonly clear signatures of outflows, as testified by a shift between\nLy\u03b1 emission and interstellar absorption lines (with a mean\nvalue of \u2206\u03bdem\u2212abs \u223c 650 km s\u22121 ). The low-ionisation interstellar absorption lines are found blueshifted by \u2206\u03bd = \u2212150 \u00b1 60\nkm s\u22121 with respect to the stellar, systemic redshift, whereas\nthe Ly\u03b1 emission is found redshifted by \u2206\u03bd = +360 km s\u22121\n(Shapley et al. 2003), i.e. quite precisely at twice the velocity\nmeasured by the interstellar (IS) absorption lines. As the latter\nare formed by simple absorption processes, i.e. by intervening gas on the line of sight between the continuous source (the\n\n\f18\n\nVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\nstarburst) and the observer, whereas Ly\u03b1 is prone to complex\nradiation transfer effects, the above empirical finding together\nwith our modeling insight indicates very clearly that on average the distribution and kinematics of the ISM in these LBGs is\nwell described by an expanding shell. This is quite naturally the\nmost simple geometry to simultaneously explain IS absorption\nlines blueshifted by an outflow velocity Vexp and an asymmetric\nLy\u03b1 line redshifted by twice this velocity!\nAs these two spectral features are formed on opposite hemispheres, IS absorption lines on the side approaching the observer and Ly\u03b1 from photons scattered back from the receding\nshell (cf. Pettini et al. 2001), this implies that overall (or \"on\naverage\" over an entire LBG sample) the ISM shell structure\nmust be fairly spherically symmetric rather than e.g. strongly\nbipolar. Such a structure may indeed be expected in case of\nstrong starbursts triggering efficient large scale outflows (see\ne.g. simulations of Mori et al. 2002).\nFor a shell geometry the finding of a velocity shift of\n\u223c 3Vexp between Ly\u03b1 and the IS absorption lines also requires\na large enough H \uf769 column density (cf. above). This is fully\ncompatible with the typical/average value of NH of the z \u223c 3\nLBG sample of (Shapley et al. 2003) expected from the standard correlation between NH and the extinction E B\u2212V .\nFinally we note that the relatively smooth, singly peaked\nLy\u03b1 line profiles observed by Shapley et al. (2003) and others are not in contradiction with our predictions. As already\nexplained above, there are several ways to avoid the multiple\npeaks predicted for certain conditions on the red side of Ly\u03b1\n(e.g. Figs. 14 to 16): among them are low expansion velocities,\nhigh column densities, or large Doppler parameters and combinations thereof. Actually, for the relatively low outflow velocity of Vexp \u223c 150 \u00b1 60 km s\u22121 deduced from the Shapley et\nal. (2003) sample, and taking into account their relatively low\nspectral resolution, no distinguishable multiple red peaks are\nexpected. At least for this sample, the problem posed by Ahn\n(2004) to avoid multiply peaked Ly\u03b1 profiles is ill posed. The\npossible but generally minor blue peak, which is predicted but\nnot observed, does not pose a problem; in these high redshift\nobjects it may be too faint to be detected or actually suppressed\nby the intervening interstellar H \uf769 clouds in the galaxy.\nLocal starbursts (see e.g. Kunth et al. 1994, 1998, Gonz\u00e1lez\nDelgado et al. 1998, Mass-Hesse et al. 2003) present P-Cygni\nprofiles with a faint secondary peak on the blue side superimposed to the absorption feature (e.g. IRAS 0833+6517),\nor more or less symmetric absorption profiles (e.g. IZw 18,\nSBS 0335-052). Mass-Hesse et al. (2003) interpret the variety of observed Ly\u03b1 profiles as phases in the time evolution\nof an expanding supershell. Few galaxies of those showing PCygni profiles have measurements of the relative velocities between the interstellar absorption lines, Ly\u03b1, and the ionised gas\n(traced e.g. by H\u03b1). Although, e.g. in Haro 2 the shift between\nLy\u03b1 and the interstellar lines is \u223c 2Vexp , their spectra are a priori not in contradiction with our simulations, as velocity shifts\n< 3Vexp are obtained for neutral column densities in the shell\nsmaller than 1020 cm\u22122 , in agreement with the value derived\nby Lequeux et al. (1995). Furthermore, the secondary peak on\nthe blue side of the P-cygni profiles is easily reproduced by\nLy\u03b1 radiation transfer through a superbubble. This is maybe\n\nthe strongest indication for such a geometry. Detailed modeling of these nearby galaxies, taking all available observational\nconstraints and spatial information into account, is necessary to\nshed more light onto these questions.\n\n6.4. General comments\nAs the above shows, the expected Ly\u03b1 profiles show already\nquite a complexity depending on the values of the main parameters considered (geometry, H \uf769 distribution and column density, velocity field, Doppler parameter, dust to gas ratio, and\ninput spectrum) and important degeneracies are found. Overall\nit is quite clear from this study and earlier ones that radiation\ntransfer effects are important to shape the emergent Ly\u03b1 profile.\nThe interpretation of observed P-Cygni profiles or asymmetric\nemission lines, for example, requires full radiation transfer calculations rather than superpositions of gaussian emission and\nVoigt-like absorption profiles as undertaken in various studies (e.g. Mas-Hesse et al. 2003, Wilman et al. 2005). Such a\ndetailed comparison with observations will be presented elsewhere.\nObviously the geometries adopted in this paper are strongly\nidealised when compared to real galaxies. Asymmetries, nonunity filling or covering factors, arbitrary geometries, and effects of different viewing and opening angles have to be considered for more realistic simulations. Although our code can\ntreat arbitrary density distributions, we have so far only investigated homogeneous media. For complementary approaches\ntreating clumpy media see e.g. Neufeld (1991), and Hansen\n& Oh (2006). Furthermore, in addition to the simple limiting\ncases of input spectra (monochromatic line plus continuum),\nother cases such as intrinsic Gaussian emission lines must be\naccounted for. All of these effects can easily be modeled with\nour generalised 3D radiation transfer code, and will be discussed in future applications.\nBeyond the Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer modeled here for simplified \"galaxian\" geometries it should be recalled that Ly\u03b1 line\nprofiles predicted in this manner are still a priori prone to alterations due to the transmission through the intervening IGM., As\nwell known (e.g. Madau 1995) this effect can significantly alter\nobserved Ly\u03b1 line profiles - especially on the blue side - for\nobjects of sufficiently high redshift (typically z >\n\u223c 3). Effects\nof the IGM have e.g. been discussed by Haiman (2004), Santos\n(2004), and Dijkstra et al. (2005b), and are not treated here.\nFor most purposes the IGM effects can be computed without\nthe need for true Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer calculations.\n\n7. Summary and conclusion\nWe have developed a new general 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\ncode allowing for arbitrary hydrogen density, ionisation & temperature structures, dust distributions, and velocity fields using\na Monte Carlo technique (Sect. 2). Currently the code works\non a cartesian grid and it can handle Ly\u03b1 transfer problems\nin objects with arbitrary hydrogen column densities. The main\nradiation\u2013matter interaction processes included in the code are\nLy\u03b1 scattering, dust scattering, and dust absorption. UV/Ly\u03b1\nphoton sources with an arbitrary spatial distribution and arbi-\n\n\fVerhamme, Schaerer & Maselli: 3D Ly\u03b1 radiation transfer\n\ntrary spectra can be treated. The main direct observables predicted by our simulations are \"global\" (i.e. integrated over all\nviewing angles) Ly\u03b1 line profiles, spectra for different viewing\ndirections and opening angles, and surface brightness maps at\ndifferent wavelengths (or integrated over Ly\u03b1).\nThe code has been tested successfully and compared\nagainst analytical results and results from other simulations\n(e.g. Neufeld 1990, Ahn et al. 2001, Zheng & Miralda-Escud\u00e9\n2002, Richling et al. 2003, Dijkstra & Haiman 2005a) for various geometrical configurations including plane parallel slabs,\ndisks, and expanding or infalling halos, and for computations\nwith and without dust. Overall an excellent agreement is found,\nexcept in cases where assumptions made in the analytical calculation break down (see Sect. 3).\nWith the aim of understanding and interpreting ultimately\nthe variety of Ly\u03b1 profiles observed in nearby and distant\nstarbursts, we have examined the Ly\u03b1 line profiles predicted\nfor several simple geometrical configurations and their dependence on the main parameters such as the H \uf769 column density,\ntemperature, velocity, and dust content. We have considered\nslabs with internal sources, disks, expanding and infalling halos\n(Sect. 3), externally illuminated slabs (Sect. 4), and expanding\nshells (Sect. 5). For the source spectrum we have considered\nthe limiting cases of pure monochromatic line emission, a pure\ncontinuum, or intermediate cases with different line strengths.\nThe two latter cases have rarely been discussed in the literature\nso far.\nSchematically, the following morphologies are found (cf.\nTable 1): profiles reaching from doubly peaked symmetric\nemission to symmetric \"Voigt-like\" (absorption) profiles in\nstatic configurations with increasing dust content, and asymmetric red- (blue-) shifted emission lines with a blue (red)\ncounterpart ranging from absorption to emission (with increasing line/continuum strength) in expanding (infalling) media.\nIn principle, symmetric or nearly symmetric profiles are only\nobtained for static geometries or for small systematic velocities. In practice, however, this may be altered by Ly\u03b1 scattering/absorption in the intervening IGM, especially at high redshift.\nSome specific results are worthwhile summarising here:\n\u2013 Pure Ly\u03b1 absorption line profiles may be observed in \"integrated\"/global spectra of objects with static geometries. In\nthis case the naturally arising double Ly\u03b1 emission peaks\nhave been suppressed by dust absorption. Standard Voigt\nprofile fitting of such profiles will significantly underestimate the true hydrogen column density (see Sect. 4).\n\u2013 It should be noted that normal (inverted) P-Cygni like Ly\u03b1\nprofiles can be obtained in expanding (infalling) media\nfrom objects without any intrinsic Ly\u03b1 emission, as a natural consequence of radiation transfer effects redistributing UV (continuum) photons from the Ly\u03b1 line center to\nthe red (blue) wing (e.g. Figs. 9, 20). Adding dust in such\ncases will progressively transform the P-Cygni profile into\na broad asymmetric absorption profile.\n\u2013 Our 3D simulations of expanding shells lead us to revise\nthe earlier results of Ahn and collaborators (Ahn et al.\n2003, Ahn 2004) and to clarify the radiation transfer pro-\n\n19\n\ncesses explaining the detailed shape of Ly\u03b1 profiles predicted from expanding shells. In particular we found that,\n20\n\u22122\nfor sufficiently large column densities (NH >\n\u223c 10 cm ),\nthe position of the main Ly\u03b1 emission peak is quite generally redshifted by approximately twice the expansion velocity (Sect. 5). This is in excellent agreement with the observations of z \u223c 3 LBGs from Shapley et al. (2003), which\nshow that Ly\u03b1 is redshifted by \u223c 2Vexp , where Vexp is the\nexpansion velocity measured from the interstellar absorption lines blueshifted with respect to the stellar (i.e. galaxian) redshift. This finding indicates also that large scale,\nfairly symmetric shell structures must be a good description for the outflows in LBGs.\nAs already clear from earlier investigations, radiation transfer effects even in the simple configurations just mentioned give\nrise to a complex morphology of Ly\u03b1 line profiles and some\ndegeneraciesare found e.g. between the main parameters such\nas the hydrogen column density NH , the Doppler parameter\nb, and also the intrinsic emission line width. However, codes\nas the one developed and presented here allow one to undertake detailed Ly\u03b1 line profile fitting to determine the physical\nproperties of the emitting gas and of the surrounding H \uf769 and\ndust and to quantify possible degeneracies. With such tools it\nis now possible to fully exploit the information encoded in Ly\u03b1\nprofiles without recurring to physically unmotivated superpositions of emission and Voigt absorption line profiles, which \u2013\nexcept in specific geometric configurations \u2013 generally do not\nproperly account for radiation transfer effects. Such detailed\nstudies of nearby and distant starforming galaxies will be presented in subsequent publications. Various other applications,\ncombining also our MCLya code with the 3D radiation transfer and photoionisation code CRASH (Maselli et al. 2003) are\nforeseen.\nAcknowledgements.
