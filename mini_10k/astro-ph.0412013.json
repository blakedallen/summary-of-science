Introduction\nPolar ring galaxies (PRGs) and related objects are peculiar systems that help to understand the formation of\ngalaxies in general, since they represent extreme cases,\nproviding clues on formation scenarios. The clearest cases\nof polar rings, named \"kinematically confirmed\" objects\nin the Polar Ring Catalog (PRC) of Whitmore et al.\n(1990), are stable objects frozen in a peculiar morphology, with matter rotating in two nearly perpendicular\nplanes. Numerical simulations have shown that this kind\nof system could be explained either by simple gas accretion (Reshetnikov & Sotnikova 1997, and Bournaud\n& Combes 2003, hereafter BC03), or by mergers of perpendicularly oriented disk galaxies (Bekki 1997 & 1998;\nBC03). However, in the PRC most objects do not show\nsuch a simple appearance with an edge-on central object and an edge-on polar ring, but rather more complex morphologies, in which they are frozen in a quasiequilibrium state, avoiding complete relaxation towards a\nSend offprint requests to: resh@astro.spbu.ru\n\u22c6\nBased on observations made at the Observat\u00f3rio do Pico\ndos Dias (OPD), operated by the MCT/Laborat\u00f3rio Nacional\nde Astrof\u00ed sica,Brazil\n\nfully mixed symmetric system. These systems with complex morphologies, called polar ring related objects, provide a unique chance to study PRG formation scenarios in\nobjects in which the initial components have not yet disappeared \u2013 if they are the results of mergers, it may still\nbe possible to recognize the progenitors in the unrelaxed\nremnants, and reconstruct their formation events. This is\nno longer possible in more relaxed merger remnants, that\nhave become elliptical galaxies with only faint shells and\nripples.\nIn this article we present the results of photometric\nobservations and an H i line spectrum of ESO 474-G26\n(PRC C-3 in Whitmore et al. 1990, and AM 0044-243 in\nArp & Madore 1987), a unique galaxy with two almost\northogonal large-scale optical rings (Fig. 1). ESO 474G26 is in the list of most luminous galaxies (Cappi et\nal. 1998), and a strong source of far-infrared (NED1 ) and\nCO emission (Galletta et al. 1997). Its nuclear spectrum\nis of an intermediate type \u2013 LINER/HII (Sekiguchi &\nWolstencroft 1993). The PRC shows optical emission-line\nrotation curves along three position angles.\n\n1\n\nNASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database\n\n\f2\n\nReshetnikov et al.: ESO 474-G26\n\nTable 1.

The\nnegative dip in the 15 500 - 15 800 km s\u22121 range is due\nto imperfectly removed radio frequency interference.\nObservations are detailed in Sect. 2, and results in\nSect. 3. A numerical simulation is presented in Sect. 4\nto illustrate a possible formation mechanism.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\n2.1. Photometric observations\nThe photometric observations were obtained in August,\n2002, on the 1.6-m telescope of the Observat\u00f3rio do Pico\ndos Dias (operated by the MCT/Laborat\u00f3rio Nacional\nde Astrof\u00edsica,Brazil), equipped with direct imaging camera #1 and a thick, back-illuminated 2048x2048, 13.5-\u03bcm\nsquare pixels CCD detector #98, and scale 0.\u2032\u2032 18/pixel.\nThe readout noise was 2.4e\u2212 and the gain, 2.5e\u2212/ADU.\nThe data were acquired with standard Johnson B, V\nand Cousins R, I band filters. Photometric calibration\nwas made using standard stars from the Landolt (1983)\nand Graham (1982) lists. The seeing during the observations was 1.\u2032\u2032 3. A log of observations is given in Table 1,\nwhere Z is the zenith angle and Skymag the extinction\ncorrected sky brightness (in mag arcsec\u22122 ). Reduction of\nthe CCD data was performed in the standard manner using the ESO-MIDAS2 package. The I band frames were\nobtained with exposure times insufficient for detailed photometry, and we used these frames for integral photometry\nonly.\n\n2.2. HI observations\nThe galaxy was observed in the 21 cm H i line at the 100mclass Nan\u00e7ay decimetric radio telescope on 23, 25 and 28\nAugust 2004, for a total of 1 hour per day. For further\ndetails on the telescope, data acquisition and data reduction methods, including the off-line elimination of radio\nfrequency interference (RFI), see Monnier Ragaigne et al.\n(2001). The half-power beam width of the telescope, of\n\u2032\n\u2032\n3.5\u00d723\n(\u03b1\u00d7\u03b4), is expected to cover the entire H i distribution of the galaxy.\nIn each daily observation a sufficiently wide velocity\nrange around the galaxy profile was found to be free of\nRFI, in which the galaxy's H i profile was detected in both\npolarizations. Residual RFI causes the negative dip in the\n15 500 - 15 800 km s\u22121 range in the averaged data (Fig. 2).\nThe average of the three spectra (see Fig. 2), smoothed\nto a velocity resolution of 18 km s\u22121 , has an rms noise\nlevel of 1.6 mJy. The galaxy profile has a peak flux\ndensity of 10 mJy, a center velocity VHI =16 249\u00b115\nkm s\u22121 , a velocity width at 50% of peak maximum\nW50 =206\u00b130 km s\u22121 , a velocity width at 20% of peak\nmaximum W20 =254\u00b146 km s\u22121 , and an integrated line\nflux IHI =1.8\u00b10.2 Jy km s\u22121 . These global H i line parameters are directly measured values; no corrections have\nbeen applied to them for, e.g., instrumental resolution.\n2\n\nMIDAS is developed and maintained by the European\nSouthern Observatory.\n\n\fReshetnikov et al.: ESO 474-G26\n\n3\n\nWe estimated the uncertainties in IHI , VHI and the line\nwidths following Schneider et al. (1986, 1990).\nA comparison with the summed CO(1-0) spectra of\nGalletta et al. (1997) shows that the widths of the profiles are comparable. The 470 km s\u22121 difference with the\npublished central velocity of the CO profile could be to be\ndue to the application of the relativistic Doppler shift formula to the CO data velocity, without the authors being\naware of this correction \u2013 converting to the conventional\noptical definition we use (V = c(\u03bb-\u03bb0 )/\u03bb0 ) raises the CO\ncenter velocity to 16 233\u00b111 km s\u22121 , consistent with our\nH i value and the published optical radial velocities.\n\n3. Results\n3.1. General structure\nESO 474-G26 is a large system \u2013 even the central galaxy\n(without the rings) is significantly larger and much more\nluminous than the Milky Way (Table 2).\nThe V -band image is displayed in Fig. 1 and represented as an isophotal plot in Fig. 3. The overall optical\nmorphology of ESO 474-G26 is very interesting and intriguing: a nearly spherical central body is surrounded by\ntwo almost perpendicular giant rings. Both ring-like structures look somewhat irregular.\n\nFig. 3. Isophotal contour map of ESO 474-G26 in the V\nband. The faintest contour is 25.8 mag arcsec\u22122 , and the\nisophote step \u2013 0.m 75.\n\nThe galaxy colors (after Galactic reddening correction and K-correction for an early-type galaxy) correspond to those of an Sb-type spiral. Fig. 4 presents the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) for ESO 474-G26.\nAs can be seen, although both observed and modeled\nSED curves for Sb galaxies fit well the observed SED\nfrom the I band to larger wavelengths, the SED for the\nprototype advanced merger remnant \"Atoms-for-Peace\"\ngalaxy,NGC 7252 (e.g., Schweizer 1982) gives a much better approximation (see further discussion).\nESO 474-G26 is a strong source of far-infrared emission (Table 2). The detected far-infrared luminosity, converted to a star formation rate, indicates a very high rate\nof star formation (Table 2), as does the large LF IR /LB\nratio of 1.1. The ratio of the H2 mass to blue luminosity\n(0.18 M\u2299 /L\u2299,B ) is typical of Sb\u2013Sbc spirals (Young &\nKnezek 1989), as are the relative H i content and the H2\nto H i ratios (Table 2).\nA faint background galaxy (with a radial velocity of\nabout 32000 km s\u22121 \u2013 see the PRC) is located 80\u2032\u2032 NW of\nESO 474-G26 (Figs. 1,3). The total apparent magnitude of\nthe galaxy is VT = 17.1\u00b10.1 and its colors are (B \u2212V )T =\n+0.82, (V \u2212 R)T = +0.30, (R \u2212 I)T \u2248 0.0. Therefore, this\nis a giant (with an absolute magnitude in the B band\nof about \u201320.7) late-type (from optical morphology and\ncolors) spiral galaxy.\nGeneral properties of ESO 474-G26 are summarized in\nTable 2.\n\nFig. 4. Spectral energy distribution for ESO 474-G26 (circles).

The central galaxy\nof ESO 474-G26 is surrounded by two ring-like structure,\none polar and one equatorial. Both rings are in rotation\naround the galaxy center. Therefore, ESO 474-G26 can be\nformally classified as a kinematically confirmed PRG. The\nthird spectrum published in the PRC shows the rotation\nof gas at a position angle of 132\u25e6 , which is intermediate\nbetween the two rings and reveals the complex kinematical\nstructure of ESO 474-G26.\nThe observed maximum rotation velocity of the galaxy\nis Vmax \u2248140 km s\u22121 at r \u2248 5\u2032\u2032 along P.A.=-3o (PRC).\nThe apparent axial ratio of this ring is hb/ai = 0.6 \u00b1 0.1.\nAssuming that the emission lines belong to the large ring,\nand that this ring is intrinsically circular, we can estimate\nits inclination as i = 53\u25e6 \u00b1 7\u25e6 . Therefore, corrected for the\ninclination, the maximum rotation velocity at r = 5\u2032\u2032 = 5\nkpc is V0max \u2248175 km s\u22121 . The mass to luminosity ratio is\nM/LB (r \u2264 5\u2032\u2032 ) \u2248 1 M\u2299 /L\u2299,B , a value that is unusual for\nearly-type galaxies and more typical of spirals with active\nstar formation. Due to the highly uncertain geometry of\nthe galaxy, the above estimates of Vmax and M/LB are\ntentative only.\n\n[6]\n[2],[7]\n\n[1] - HyperLEDA mean value; [2] \u2013 NASA/IPAC Extragalactic\nDatabase (NED); [3] \u2013 Skrutskie et al.

The second\n(larger) ring has P.A.=170\u25e6 and diameter of 58\u2032\u2032 (58 kpc).\nIn projection, the angle between the two rings is 76\u25e6 .\nThe optical colors of the rings were determined\nthrough a 10\u2032\u2032 diameter circular aperture placed on the\nbrightest parts of the rings along its major axes. In the\nlarge ring we found the following colors at the indicated\npositions with respect to the nucleus:\nB \u2212 V = 0.69, V \u2212 R = 0.38 (32\u2032\u2032 N),\nB \u2212 V = 0.56, V \u2212 R = 0.36 (27\u2032\u2032 S).\nand for the smaller ring:\nB \u2212 V = 0.69, V \u2212 R = 0.48 (17\u2032\u2032 W),\nB \u2212 V = 0.54, V \u2212 R = 0.43 (21\u2032\u2032 E).\nTherefore, both rings are bluer than the central galaxy\n(see previous section), and its extinction and redshift corrected colors (B \u2212 V \u2248 0.5, V \u2212 R \u2248 0.4) are typical for\nSc-Scd spirals (Buta et al. 1994; Buta & Williams 1995)\nand similar to those of PRG rings (Reshetnikov et al. 1994,\n1995).\nBoth rings show a color asymmetry, in the sense that\ntheir N and W parts are redder, which is not unusual for\npolar rings \u2013 see for instance the correlation found between\nthe large-scale color asymmetry in the rings of the PRGs\nUGC 7576 and UGC 9796.\nVarious techniques of image enhancement have been\nemployed to reveal fine structure within ESO 474-G26\n(see, for example, Fa\u00fandez-Abans & de Oliveira-Abans\n1998, for a description of some techniques).

Most\nprobably, the condensations represent giant H ii regions.\nThe larger outer (north\u2013south) ring has the southern\npart approaching (PRC, Galletta et al. 1997). The western\npart of the ring is probably the nearest to us (from the\ndust lane crossing the western side of the central body \u2013\nsee Fig. 1). In Fig. 8 we present a deep (B + V + R) and\nsmoothed image of ESO 474-G26. A faint (\u03bc(V ) \u2265 26m )\nasymmetric envelope extends to the east. The North and\nSouth edges of the large ring show extensions towards the\neast and west, respectively; they might be spiral arms.\n\n4. Discussion and conclusions\nThe true geometrical structure and the possible origin of\nESO 474-G26 are intriguing mysteries. A number of formation scenarios \u2013 resonance ring, accretion on a ringed\n\nearly-type galaxy, and a minor merger \u2013 can be excluded,\nfor the following reasons:\n\n\u2013 Although the larger ring reveals some spiral structure,\nit cannot be an outer pseudo-ring of a resonant nature\n(e.g., Buta & Combes 1996), since the central galaxy\nis clearly not the barred disk galaxy required to form\nsuch a ring.\n\u2013 The irregular and unrelaxed aspect of the system could\nindicate a relatively recent external polar accretion\nfrom a gas-rich donor galaxy onto a pre-existing earlytype galaxy with an outer ring. If so, one would expect\nto find the relic of the donor galaxy within a reasonable distance from ESO 474-G26, but ESO 474-G26\nappears to be isolated and without a companion within\n1 Mpc projected distance at similar redshift.\n\n\f6\n\nReshetnikov et al.: ESO 474-G26\n\nFig. 7.

The\nimage size is 1.\u2032 8 \u00d7 2.\u2032 1.\n\u2013 A minor merger with a peculiar geometry that formed\nthe inner polar ring is unlikely to have resulted in the\nobserved unperturbed outer pseudo-ring.\nIt is appropriate to test a major merger scenario\nthat forms both rings at the same time, since, globally,\nESO 474-G26 shows analogies to the prototypical merger\nremnant NGC 7252 (Schweizer 1982) \u2013 which is also a\ngiant galaxy, with an elliptical-like surface brightness profile, relatively blue colors, peculiar kinematics, outer structures, and a similar spectral energy distribution (as shown\nin Fig. 4).\nTo reproduce ESO 474-G26 in detail, we have to solve\na reverse problem: to find the characteristics and orien-\n\ntations of the progenitor galaxies (as well as their orbits) from the observed structure of the merger remnant.\nOf course, this is not a fully determined problem, and\nmany pieces of observational data are missing, like the 2D\ngaseous and stellar kinematics of the system. Therefore,\nwe choose to find a generic solution only that reproduces\na double ringed optical appearance with the right relative\nproportions of the galaxy.\nOn the basis of the results by Bekki (1998) and BC03,\nwe have considered a low-velocity head-on collision between two galaxies with orthogonal spiral disks. The simulations were performed with an N -body particle code\nwhich includes gas dynamics, star formation and stellar\nmass-loss (see Bournaud & Combes 2002, 2003 for details).\nAfter several trials, we found an acceptable solution\n(Figs. 9 and 10). The main galaxy, hereafter denoted as\nthe victim (as in Bekki 1998), is a giant spiral galaxy\n(the exponential scalelength of the stellar disk is 5.3 kpc)\nwith a total mass Mtot = 6.1 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , a bulge-to-disk\nluminosity ratio 0.25, and a relatively low gas fraction\nMgas /Mstars =0.03. The galaxy is surrounded by a moderately massive spherical dark halo with a mass ratio\nMDH /Mstars =1.2. The second galaxy, the intruder, has a\ntotal mass of Mtot = 2.7 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , an exponential scalelength of its stellar disk of 2.4 kpc, Mgas /Mstars =0.065,\nand MDH /Mstars =1.1. Initially, the galaxies were separated by 70 kpc and their relative velocity was 70 km s\u22121 .\nFig. 9 shows the morphological evolution of the galaxies during the merging process. The total number of particles used in this simulation is 2\u00d7105. At t=700 Myr (or\nabout 350 Myr after the first crossing), we show in Fig. 10\na projection of the system that is selected to mimic the\nobserved double-ring appearance. At this time, the merger\nremnant shows a ring-like structure along its apparent minor axis: this ring consists of tidal debris from the intruder,\nand is polar with respect to the victim disk. At the same\ntime, an expanding collisional ring of the Cartwheel type\nis formed by the victim galaxy material, which is polar\nwith respect to the intruder galaxy's initial plane. Thus,\nwe find the two types of rings studied in BC03 around the\nsame object. The diameter of the collisional ring is 60 kpc,\nin agreement with the size of the large ring of ESO 474G26 (Sect. 3.3). As one can see in Fig. 6, our model fits\nthe observed rotation curve of ESO 474-G26 along the\nsmall ring, and is not inconsistent with the major axis\nkinematics, at least in the brightest regions of this ring.\nWe show in Fig. 11 the composition of the two rings: the\nsmall, tidal ring is only made up of stars from the intruder\ngalaxy (i.e., stars that initially were in the intruder disk,\nor stars formed recently from the intruder's gas), and the\nlarge ring is only made up of stars from the victim galaxy.\nThe degree of mixing of the stellar populations in the rings\nis less than 2%.\nThere are two differences between ESO 474-G26 and\nour artificial merger. The first is that the ratio of the\nbrightness of the rings to that of the peak in the central galaxy is half the value in the model to that actually\n\n\fReshetnikov et al.: ESO 474-G26\n\n7\n\nFig. 9.

The image size is 100 kpc \u00d7 100\nkpc. The projection was selected to fit the appearance of\nESO 474-G26.\nobserved. However, we have assumed a constant mass-tolight ratio in the model. As the rings mainly contain young\nstars, they could have a lower M/L ratio than the central\ngalaxy, which solves this problem. The second difference\nis that the inner part of the model remnant looks unrelaxed in comparison to the observed smooth, elliptical-like\nsurface brightness distribution in ESO 474-G26.\nIn the simulations, the small ring, or the vertical coherent structure (see Fig. 10) is a transient feature. It persists for about 200 Myr and then disperses and vanishes.\nApproximately 1 Gyr after the full merging, the remnant\nbecomes smooth and elliptical-like. Therefore, the impressive double-ring appearance of ESO 474-G26 could also be\ntransient and not reflect a stable dynamical configuration.\nIt appears likely that we are indeed observing a\ntransient stage in a particular merging scenario, since\nESO 474-G26 is the only clear example with two such\nrings among \u2248 3 \u00d7 104 known galaxies with B \u226415.m 5\n(PRC, NED).\nWe thus conclude that one of the most plausible solutions is that ESO 474-G26 represents a transient phase\nof a merging process between two spiral galaxies. This is\nbased on its observational characteristics, which are typical of merger remnants, as well as on numerical simulations that reproduce the general morphology of the galaxy.\nAcknowledgements.
