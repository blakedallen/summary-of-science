By fixing the energy difference between the first two quantum dots to be equal to phonon\nfrequency and sweeping the level of the third quantum dot, we find a largely enhanced current\nspectrum due to phonon effect, and in particular we predict current peaks corresponding to\nphonon-absorption and -emission assisted resonant tunneling processes, which shows that this\nsystem can be acted as a sensitive phonon-signal detector or as a cascade phonon generator.\n\nPhonon-assisted inelastic tunneling in semiconductor quantum dot (QD) system at low\ntemperature has become a focus issue in recent years. [1\u201310] In particular, a recent experiment\nhas measured the nonlinear tunneling through a double-QD (DQD) with the observation of\nspontaneous phonon emission leading to an additional satellite peak in the current spectrum,\n[1] which can be ascribed to an interference effect of the electron-phonon interaction (EPI)\nin a DQD via nonperturbative theoretical analyses. [2\u20134] This experiment opens a possibility\nof designing DQD as a coherent phonon generator. However, the phonon-assisted peak in\ncurrent spectrum is quite fragile and thus detection of phonon-signal is a difficult task in a\nDQD. [1]\nIn this letter, we propose a setup containing a triple QD in series coupled to a common\nlocal phonon bath and two normal leads, in which energy difference between the first two QDs\nis fixed to be equal to the phonon frequency, i.e., head of the device acts as a phonon emitter\nwhen there is a nonequilibrium current flowing through as suggested by Fujisawa et al. [1]\nIntuitively, it is imaginable that if the energy of the third QD is tuned, via applying gate\nvoltage, to be higher than the second QD with one-phonon-energy (case a in Fig. 1 below),\nthe emitted phonon could be re-absorbed by electron to help electron tunneling through QD\n3 resonantly, resulting in a phonon-absorption-assisted enhanced peak in current spectrum.\nThat is to say that QD 3 detects the generated phonon. On the other hand, we predict a\nsignificant enhancement of current provided that the energy of QD 3 is further lower than QD\n2 by one-phonon-energy (case c in Fig. 1), showing that more phonon quanta are generated\nin tunneling process.\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\n\u0393L\n\nT1\n\n\u0393R\n\nT2\n\n\u03bcL\nphonon emission\n\n\u03b51\n\nh\u0304\u03c90\n\u03b52\n\n\u03b53\n\na\nb\nc\n\n\u03bcR\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Schematic description of tunneling of a triple-QD in the presence of electron-phonon interaction. \u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb2 = ~\u03c90 ; a, b, and c denotes \u01eb3 \u2212 \u01eb2 = ~\u03c90 , 0, and \u2212~\u03c90 , respectively. \u03bcL (\u03bcR ) responds to\nchemical potentials of the lead L(lead R). \u0393L and \u0393R stands for the coupling between the lead with\nQD. T1 and T2 is the coupling between QDs.\n\nOur setup is schematically shown in Fig. 1. We consider a triple QD (consisting of QD 1,\nQD 2, and QD 3) which are connected via a tunnel barrier. QD 1 and QD 3 are connected to an\nelectron reservoir in thermal equilibrium with chemical potentials \u03bcL (source) and \u03bcR (drain),\nrespectively, with \u03bcL > \u03bcR . Its Hamiltonian can be written as\nH = HL + HR + Hcen + HT ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere HL + HR describe the two leads, Hcen represents the central region consisting of a triple\nQD in series, and HT is the coupling of the dots to the lead, respectively:\nX\nHL + HR =\n\u01eb\u03b7k c\u2020\u03b7k c\u03b7k ,\n(2)\n\u03b7\u2208L,R;k\n\nHcen =\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n\u01eb\u03b1 d\u2020\u03b1 d\u03b1 + ~\u03c90 b\u2020 b \u2212\n\nX\n\nHT =\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03bb\u03b1 d\u2020\u03b1 d\u03b1 (b\u2020 + b) \u2212 T1 (d\u20201 d2 + d\u20202 d1 ) \u2212 T2 (d\u20202 d3 + d\u20203 d2 ), (3)\n\nX\n(VL c\u2020Lk d1 + VR d\u20203 cRk + H.c.),\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nwhere c\u2020\u03b7k (c\u03b7k ) (\u03b7 = {L, R}) and d\u2020\u03b1 (d\u03b1 ) denote creation (annihilation) operators for spinless\nelectrons with momentum k and energy \u01eb\u03b7k in the left and right leads, and for spinless electrons\non the \u03b1th (\u03b1 = {1, 2, 3}) QD, respectively. \u01eb\u03b1 is the energy level of the \u03b1th QD, and T1 (T2 )\nstands for the interdot hopping between the QD 1 and QD 2 (QD 2 and QD 3). VL(R) is\nthe coupling constant of the central regime with lead L(R). This sort of triple-QD system\nwas already realized in experiments about ten years ago, in which the energy levels of every\nQD and dot-dot hoppings can all be adjusted by applying gate voltages. [11] The operator\nb\u2020 (b) in Eq. (3) creates (destroys) a phonon, and \u03bb\u03b1 is the interaction constant of the electron\non the \u03b1th dot with phonon. Here, we consider the phonon bath as a single-mode phonon\nwith dispersionless energy ~\u03c90 , and assume that phonon remains coherence during electron\ntunneling processes, i.e., we take no account of phonon dissipation in the present investigation.\nFor simplicity, we also ignore electron-electron interaction in this letter.\nAs the system under study contains a many-body problem of electron-phonon scattering\nduring the single-electron tunneling process, it can not be solved analytically. Applying the\n\n\fX. Y. Shen, Bing Dong, X. L. Lei: Phonon-assisted resonant tunneling through a triple-quantum-dot: a phonon-sig\n\nnonperturbative mapping technique suggested by Bon\u010da and Trugman [5], we can transform\nthe many-body problem into a multichannel one-body problem by transforming the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) in terms of a new set of electron states combined of single-electron states and\nn-phonon states. We define a direct product states with single-electron states and n-phonon\nFock states as:\n(b\u2020 )n\n(5)\n|\u03b1, ni = d\u2020\u03b1 \u221a |0i,\nn!\nand\n\n(b\u2020 )n\n|\u03b7k, ni = c\u2020\u03b7k \u221a |0i,\nn!\n\n(6)\n\nsuch that the electron state |\u03b1i in QD and the state of electron in leads |\u03b7ki are accompanied by\nn phonons (|0i is the vacuum state). We perform this transformation on the electron-phonon\ninteraction part of Eq. (3), so the many body problem can be mapped onto a one-body model:\nX\n\u221a\n\u2212\u03bb\u03b1 n + 1(|\u03b1, n + 1ih\u03b1, n| + |\u03b1, nih\u03b1, n + 1|).\n(7)\n\u03b1n\n\nWith defining these Dirac bracket as new operators:\nd\u2020\u03b1n = |\u03b1, ni, c\u2020\u03b7kn = |\u03b7k, ni,\nwe obtain:\n\nX\n\n\u221a\n\u03bb\u03b1 n + 1(d\u2020\u03b1n+1 d\u03b1n + d\u2020\u03b1n d\u03b1n+1 ).\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\n\u03b1n\n\ne =H\neL +H\neR +H\ne cen + H\ne T : [4]\nWe can do the same transformation on the Hamiltonian Eq. 1 as H\nX\ne L + H\u0303R =\nH\n\u01eb\u03b7kn c\u2020\u03b7kn c\u03b7kn ,\n(10)\n\u03b7\u2208L,R;kn\n\ne cen =\nH\n\nX\n\u03b1n\n\n\u01eb\u03b1n d\u2020\u03b1n d\u03b1n \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u221a\n\u03bb\u03b1 n + 1(d\u2020\u03b1n+1 d\u03b1n +H.c.)\u2212T1 (d\u20201n d2n +H.c.)\u2212T2 (d\u20202n d3n +H.c.),\n\n\u03b1n\n\neT =\nH\n\nX\n\n(VLn c\u2020Lkn d1n + VRn d\u20203n cRkn + H.c.),\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nkn\n\nwhere d\u2020\u03b1n and c\u2020\u03b7kn are new operators with phonon quanta n, \u01eb\u03b1n = \u01eb\u03b1 + n~\u03c90 , \u01eb\u03b7kn =\n\u01eb\u03b7k + n~\u03c90 .

(13):\nrL(R),mn = \u2212\u03b4mn + i\u0393Gr11(33),mn (\u03c9),\ntL(R),mn = i\u0393Gr31(13),mn (\u03c9).\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nFurthermore, we use the B\u00fcttiker scatting method to calculate the shot noise [13] and follow\nour previous work, [4] we obtain the zero-frequency shot noise of the system:\nSLL (0)\n\n=\n\n2e2\nh\n\n\u00d7(1 \u2212\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\n\nX\n\n{|(t\u2020L tL )mn |2 Pn fLn (\u03c9)(1 \u2212 fLm (\u03c9)) + |(t\u2020L rL )mn |2 [Pn fLn (\u03c9)\n\nmn\nm\nfR (\u03c9)) +\n\nPm fRm (\u03c9)(1 \u2212 fLn (\u03c9))] + |(t\u2020R tR )mn |2 Pn fRn (\u03c9)(1 \u2212 fRm (\u03c9))}.(17)\n\nIn order to obtain a more physical view of the results, we now make a numerical simulation\nof the current and the shot noise based on Eqs. (14) and (17) as functions of the energy\ndifference between QD 2 and QD 3: \u01eb = \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb3 (which can be tuned by applying gate voltage).\nWith considering the experiment by Fujisawa, [1] we choose the temperature T = 23mk\n(kB T = 2\u03bceV), and dispersionless phonon ~\u03c90 = 20\u03bceV. The scale of the dot is d = cs /\u03c90 =\n175nm where cs = 5300m/s is the longitudinal sound velocity. At low temperature the\nphonons are assumed to be piezoelectric acoustical mode with interaction constant |\u03bb|2 =\n1\n~P\n2\u03c0 2\u03c1V \u03c90 , where P is the piezoelectric coupling, \u03c1 is the ion mass density, V is the volume. [14]\nEmploying the typical GaAs parameters, [14] we get \u03bb \u223c 1.6\u03bceV. We find the electron-phonon\ninteraction constant \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 on the three quantum dots coincide up to a phase factor. [2]\nFor simplicity, we choose phase factor is \u22121 between the QD 1 and QD 2 (QD 2 and QD\n3), so we get \u03bb1 = \u2212\u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = 1.6\u03bceV (This can be done by tuning size of each dot and\ndistance between them in experiments). In this cases, we set the couplings of the dots with\nthe two leads to be symmetric, \u0393L = \u0393R = \u0393 = 4\u03bceV, and the interdot hoppings to be equal,\nT1 = T2 = Tc = 4\u03bceV. We assume \u01eb2 = 0\u03bceV, which is equal to the Fermi energies of the\nleft lead and right lead at equilibrium. We also set the energy gap of the QD 1 and QD 2 as\n\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb2 = ~\u03c90 = 20\u03bceV and the symmetrically applied bias voltage \u03bcL \u2212 \u03bcR = eVsd = 200\u03bceV\nso that \u03bcL \u226b \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 , \u01eb3 \u226b \u03bcR , in which condition sufficient more pseudo-channels are involved\nin transport and thus our numerical results are nearly independent of the bias-voltage.\n\n\fX.

It is interesting to find a peak at \u01eb = \u01eb2 \u2212\u01eb3 = \u2212~\u03c90\n(where \u01eb1 = \u01eb3 ) in the system without considering electron-phonon interaction. This peak is\ndue to a resonant tunneling between QD1 and QD3 via QD 2. We can describe the dynamics of\nthe triple QD system with quantum rate equations for the density matrix of the dots. [15] With\nsolving the master equation algebraically, we get the current at zero temperature analytically\nas:\n4\u0393Tc4\ne\n,\n(18)\nI=\n4\n2\n2\n~ 16Tc + (2\u0393 + 8\u01eb + 16\u01eb\u01eb12 + 8\u01eb212 )Tc2 + 4\u01eb412 + \u01eb212 \u03932 + 4\u01eb212 \u01eb2 + 8\u01eb312 \u01eb\nwith \u01eb12 = \u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb2 . It is obvious to obtain the peak of current at \u01eb = \u2212\u01eb12 = ~\u03c90 .\nIn Fig.2 we also plot the total current of the triple-QD system in the presence of EPI vs\nthe energy difference \u01eb. Similar with the current spectrum of a double-QD system, [1\u20134] an\nobvious overall enhancement of current is found for the triple-QD system with phonon bath\nin comparison with that without EPI. Moreover, as above expected, our results predict three\ncurrent peaks labeled by a, b, and c, which are corresponding to the three configurations\ndescribed in Fig. 1. When an extremely large bias-voltage is applied to the whole system,\nan electron can resonantly jump from QD 1 to QD 2 accompanied by one-phonon generated,\nthen if the system is at configuration b, \u01eb2 = \u01eb3 , the electron can directly resonantly tunnel\nthrough the device and the current peak b is caused by phonon emission between QD1 and\nQD2; however, if the system is at configuration c, \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb3 = ~\u03c90 , the electron will emit\nanother phonon to reach QD 3, leading to two-phonon-emission peak c; more interestingly,\nif the system is at configuration a, \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb3 = \u2212~\u03c90 , an enhanced current peak a also occurs\nstemming from re-absorption of the generated phonon in head of the device by electron to\novercome the barrier between QD 2 and QD 3, which is enhanced by 30% in comparison to\nthe resonant peak without EPI. Of course, phonon dissipation to environment could lessen\nthese phonon-assisted resonant peaks. Albeit we do not consider nonequilibrium phonon\neffect [7, 8] and dissipation due to environment, [9, 10] however, it can be expected from our\nabove calculations that the multi-QD system could function as a cascade phonon generator\nwith higher emission efficiency than a double-QD or as a sensitive and \"good\" phonon-signal\ndetector. Actually, we can put this system into a phonon resonant cavity in experiments to\nlessen the leakage of phonon and thus to enhance the probability of re-absorption of phonon.\n\n\f6\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nwith EPI\nwithout EPI\n\n0.9\n1.5\n\nwith EPI\nwithout EPI\n\n0.8\n\nFano\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\nS(2e /h)\n\n0.7\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.0\n-60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u03b5(\u03bceV)\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n0.2\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n\u03b5(\u03bceV)\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 (a) Zero-frequency shot noise versus energy difference \u01eb with the same parameter of Fig.2;\n(b) Fano factor versus energy difference \u01eb.\n\nThese studies will be the subject in our future work.\nWe also examine the zero-frequency shot-noise (a) and Fano factor F = SLL /2eI (b) with\nthe energy difference \u01eb, as plotted in Fig.3. Corresponding to the three current peaks due\nto phonon-absorption or -emission, the shot noise spectrum shows also single peak in the\nphonon-assisted resonant tunneling region. As the shot noise S \u223c Ttr (1 \u2212 Ttr ), which Ttr is\ntransmission probability, there is no shot noise generation when the Ttr = 1 or 0. The maximal\ngeneration of the shot noise occurs while the transmission probability is between 0 and 1. We\nalso find a small peak at \u01eb = 0 in the absence of phonon. However, the shoulder at \u01eb = 0 is\nsmeared smoothly by the interaction of phonon. The Fano factor F displays three dips at the\nthree points a, b, and c, implying that the inelastic resonance suppresses the shot noise. It\nis worth noticing that the phonon-absorption-assisted tunneling induces a more pronounced\ndip.\nIn summary, we investigate the resonant tunneling through a triple QD in the presence of\nEPI at low temperature by means of the nonperturbative mapping technique in combination\nwith the nonequilibrium GF method. By making the first two dots act as a phonon emitter\nand sweeping the energy level of the third QD, we evaluate the tunneling current and predict\nthat resonant peaks in the current spectrum are not only due to spontaneous phonon-emission\nassisted tunneling, but also due to phonon-absorption process. We also study zero-frequency\nshot noise of this sytem.\nThis work was supported by Projects of the National Science Foundation of China, the\nShanghai Municipal Commission of Science and Technology, the Shanghai Pujiang Program,\nand NCET.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] T.
