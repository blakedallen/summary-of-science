QCD allows us\nto interpret the light octet mesons as Goldstone bosons.\nThe four-dimensional (Euclidean) lattice discretization\nof QCD provides a unique ab initio non-perturbative approach. However, in this approach chiral symmetry has\nto be treated with special care. At present, on the lattice\nthis symmetry is best realized by satisfying the GinspargWilson relation [1] for the lattice Dirac operator, e.g.,\nemploying the so-called overlap operator [2, 3], or using\nthe five-dimensional domain wall fermion ansatz [4\u20136].\nIn both cases the Wilson-Dirac operator W (m0 ) (with a\nbare mass parameter m0 \u2208 (\u22122, 0)) serves as an input for\nthe fermionic part of the lattice discretized action.\nFor the Wilson-Dirac operator (which breaks chiral invariance explicitly) Aoki [7] has argued that in a certain\nrange of the hopping parameter \u03ba (or the bare mass m0 )\nthere is a phase in which parity-flavor symmetry is spontaneously broken, in the sense that a condensate as defined in Eq. (1) exists and is non-vanishing. In agreement\nwith the literature we call it the Aoki phase. When \u03ba approaches the border lines of this phase all pion masses\ntend to zero because one is approaching a second order\nphase transition. In the whole Aoki phase the charged\npion states are expected to remain massless (in the case\nof Nf = 2 flavors) since they appear to be the Goldstone bosons related to parity-flavor breaking, whereas\nthe neutral pion should become massive again. The general phase structure as proposed by Aoki is shown in\nFig. 1. Some numerical results supporting this picture\nwere presented in Refs. [7\u201312].\nIt has been questioned whether the Aoki phase survives\nthe continuum limit (in the sense of extending to \u03b2 = \u221e)\nor, alternatively, ends somewhere at finite \u03b2, perhaps before the scaling regime is reached. Previous investigations\nof this problem did not yield a unique answer [10\u201315].\n\nIn this paper we present results of a more thorough numerical analysis of this question. As has been discussed\nrecently [16], the answer is of relevance for the locality behavior and the restoration of chiral invariance in\nquenched and full QCD with Ginsparg-Wilson and domain wall fermions. Accordingly, the region of the Aoki\nphase has to be avoided in such computations in order\nnot to spoil physical reliability.\nOur investigation was carried out for full lattice QCD\nwith Nf = 2 flavors of unimproved Wilson fermions using\nthe standard plaquette gauge action. It includes a careful\nextrapolation of h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i to vanishing external field. It\nshows that the Aoki phase is unlikely to extend beyond\n\u03b2 = 4.6 (which confirms early conclusions in Ref. [14]).\nThe outline of our paper is as follows. In Sec. II we\ndiscuss the proposed phase structure in greater detail.\nSection III provides details of our numerical simulations.\nIn Sec. IV we present our numerical results. Section V\ncontains the discussion and our conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PHASE STRUCTURE\n\nAoki, in his last status report [15], has discussed the\nlattice results supporting the view that for lattice QCD\nwith Nf = 2 Wilson fermions there exists a parity-flavor\nbreaking phase which is separated from an unbroken\nphase (or from unbroken phases) by second order phase\ntransition lines. The conjectured phase structure in the\n(g 2 , m0 ) plane is shown on the left-hand side of Fig. 1. As\ncan be seen from this figure, two of these critical lines run\nfrom strong coupling to the weak coupling limit, while\nfurther critical lines are confined to the weak coupling\nregion. At zero coupling, pairs of these transition lines\njoin at points referring to the different fermion doublers.\nAoki [8] has further claimed that along the critical lines\nthe pion triplet is massless. The neutral pion becomes\nmassless only on the critical lines, due to the presence of\na second order phase transition, while the charged pions\nturn massless on the critical lines and remain massless\n\n\f\u03ba\n\n8\n\ng2\n\n8\n\n2\nm0\n\u22128/3\n\n3/8\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n<\u03c8\u03b9\u03b35\u03c43\u03c8> = 0\n\n<\u03c8\u03b9\u03b35\u03c4 3\u03c8> = 0\n\nB\n\n1/4\n\ng2c\n\n\u22128\n\n\u22126\n\nA\n\u22124\n\nA\nA\n\nA\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n1/8\n\n0\n\nm0\n\n0\n\n8\n\nA\n\nA\n\n\u22122\n\nB\n\n\u03b2\n\nFIG. 1: The phase diagram proposed by Aoki et al. in the (g 2 , m0 ) plane (left-hand side) and in the (\u03b2, \u03ba) plane (right-hand\nside). The shaded region labeled B denotes the phase where flavor and parity are spontaneously broken. Both symmetries are\nconserved in regions labeled A.\n\ninside the Aoki phase signaling that flavor symmetry is\nbroken.\nWhen simulating the theory it is natural to draw the\nphase diagram in the (\u03b2, \u03ba) plane . Using the well known\nrelations \u03ba = 1/(2m0 + 8) and \u03b2 = 6/g 2 , the proposed\nphase structure is mapped to this plane as shown on\nthe right-hand side of Fig. 1. Therein the symmetry\nm0 \u2194 \u2212(m0 + 8) is hidden in the reflection \u03ba \u2194 \u2212\u03ba\nwhich is not made explicit for simplicity. The critical\nline \u03bac (\u03b2) which runs from \u03b2 = 0 to infinity is nothing but the chiral limit line of lattice QCD. Thus the\nscenario proposed by Aoki et al. might explain why all\npions are massless along this line despite the fact that\nWilson fermions explicitly break chiral symmetry.\nIn principle, the Aoki phase could be expected to exist\nfor all values of \u03b2. In the strong coupling region the existence of such a phase was verified by performing numerical simulations of QCD with Wilson fermions as summarized in [15] and reconsidered in [12]. For this purpose a so-called twisted mass term h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8 was added\nto the action which explicitly breaks parity-flavor symmetry. Without an external field h coupling to \u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8,\nthe parameter h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i would always be zero on a finite\nlattice. h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i has to be measured for varying lattice\nsize V and non-vanishing h values. The order parameter\nh\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8ih=0 is then obtained by taking the double limit\nin the following order\nh\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8ih=0 = lim lim h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i .\nh\u21920 V \u2192\u221e\n\n(1)\n\nIn the literature one finds numerical results from\nquenched [11] and unquenched [10, 12] simulations at\nfinite h which support the existence of a parity-flavor\nbreaking phase, at least for \u03b2 \u2264 4.0. However, extrapolations in order to carry out the double limit (1) had not\nbeen performed.\nGoing to larger values of \u03b2 there are contradictory\nstatements about the existence of such a broken phase.\nBitar [14] has come to the conclusion that there is no\nAoki phase for \u03b2 \u2265 5.0. However, results from quenched\n\nsimulations [11] suggest that the finger structure anticipated by Aoki exists.\nAoki's scenario was also challenged in Refs. [17\u201319].\nIn particular, in Ref. [17] it has been argued that flavor\nand parity are not violated at finite lattice spacing. The\nauthors have rather proposed that the Aoki phase has\nto be interpreted as a phase with massless quarks and\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.\nIn Ref. [13] the controversy has been concisely elucidated in the sense that, at finite lattice spacing a, the\nWilson lattice theory is able to exhibit flavor and parity breaking under certain circumstances. The authors\nhave also demonstrated that the results of [18, 19] concerning the spectrum of the Hermitean Wilson-Dirac operator \u03b35 W (m0 ) (actually obtained for quenched or partially quenched lattice QCD) lend support, if correctly\ninterpreted, to a non-vanishing condensate as defined in\nEq. (1).\nIn terms of an effective chiral Lagrangian, it has been\npointed out in Ref. [13] that only two possible scenarios may exist, depending on the sign of one coupling\ncoefficient. In the first case, the Aoki picture [8] is exactly reproduced, whereas in the second case all pion\nmasses remain degenerate and non-vanishing over the\nwhole (g 2 , m0 ) plane such that no Aoki phase exists at\nall. If the first case applies to lattice QCD all the way to\nthe continuum limit specific predictions concerning the a\ndependence of the neutral pion mass and of the width of\nthe Aoki finger pointing towards (m0 = 0, g 2 = 0) have\nbeen made. However, if the sign turns to the second case\nthe Aoki phase ceases to exist at strong coupling and\nthose predictions do not apply.\nAfter that, the only remaining question is whether the\nAoki phase really persists until the continuum limit and,\nif it does so, how it shrinks to the point (m0 = 0, g 2 = 0).\nOnly numerical simulations can clarify whether there is a\nstrip of parity-flavor breaking phase in lattice QCD with\nWilson fermions extending to infinite \u03b2.\n\n\f3\n\nh\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c43 \u03c8i\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\nh\n0.01\n\n0\n0.16\n\n0.18\n\n0.20\n\n\u03ba\n\n0.22\n\n0.24\n\n0.26\n\n0.28\n\n0\n\nFIG. 2: Results for h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i as a function of \u03ba and h at \u03b2 = 4.0 on a 64 lattice.\n\nIII.\n\nSIMULATION DETAILS\n\nIV.\n\nWe have simulated lattice QCD with two flavors of\n(unimproved) Wilson fermions with (the \u03a6 version of)\nthe hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm [20, 21] where an\neven/odd decomposition [22] has been employed. An explicitly symmetry breaking source term was added to the\nWilson fermion matrix MW , i.e. the two-flavor fermion\nmatrix was given by\n\nM (h) = MW + hi\u03b35 \u03c4 3 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe simulations were performed on lattices ranging from\n44 to 124 at \u03b2 values 4.0, 4.3, 4.6, and 5.0, with \u03ba and h\nin the intervals 0.15 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 0.28 and 0.003 \u2264 h \u2264 0.04,\nrespectively.\nIn our study we measured h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i as a function of\n\u03ba at finite h. The parameter h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i, which is proportional to the imaginary part of the trace of \u03b35 M \u22121 (h),\nwas averaged over 100\u20131000 gauge field configurations\n(see Table II) separated by trajectories of length 1. The\ntrace was measured with a stochastic estimator [23].\nFor illustration, results for h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i from a 64 lattice\nat \u03b2 = 4.0 are shown in Fig. 2. The location of the peak\ndetermines the region where subsequent simulations on\nlarger lattices and smaller h were performed. In Fig. 2\nthe peak is around \u03ba = 0.22. It becomes sharper as h\ndecreases. We have increased the lattices until measurements agreed within errors such that we can treat our\nlargest lattices as infinitely large. The extrapolation to\nvanishing h is described in the following section.\n\nEXTRAPOLATING TO VANISHING\nEXTERNAL FIELD\n\nIn Fig. 3 an analysis of h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i data is shown for\n\u03b2 = 4.0 and 4.3. As can be seen from the upper and\nlower left plot the interesting region is around \u03ba = 0.22\nand \u03ba = 0.21, respectively. At these (\u03b2, \u03ba) pairs further\nsimulations were performed in order to control finite-size\neffects. Data from these simulations are shown in the\ncenter plots of Fig. 3. No finite size effects are visible in\nthe plots except for data from the 44 lattice at \u03b2 = 4.0.\nHence, the measurements of h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i from the largest\nlattice at each h can be considered to lie within errors on\nthe infinite volume envelope.\nThe question arises how to fit these data properly. Motivated from the mean field equation\nh = A0 \u03c3 3 + A1*(\u03ba \u2212 \u03bac ) \u03c3\n\nwith \u03c3 \u2261 h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i (3)\n\nwe use the ansatz\n\u03c3(h) = A + BhC + . . .\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nIt is instructive to look at so-called Fisher plots [24, 25]\n(see the right-hand side of Fig. 3). From Eq. (3) one expects data for \u03ba \u2264 \u03bac to lie on straight lines ending at the\norigin or at the abscissa, while within the broken phase\nthey should lie on straight lines ending at the ordinate.\nAs can be seen from the Fisher plots obtained the data\ndo not lie on straight lines and therefore do not behave\nmean-field like.\nUsing Eq. (4) with the mean field value C = 1/3 results in unstable fitting functions, but taking C as a free\nparameter instead, the ansatz describes the data well.\nIn fact, the parameter of interest A is robust against\nthe introduction of linear and quadratic correction terms\n(see Table I).

The extrapolation to h = 0 in the infinite volume limit is shown in the center column\nof this figure. The right column shows the Fisher plots with the corresponding fitting function. The upper row shows results\nfor \u03b2 = 4.0, the lower one for \u03b2 = 4.3.\n\nagree within errors for both values of \u03b2, even when introducing corrections. We conclude that the order parameter h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8ih=0 is non-zero at (\u03b2, \u03ba) = (4.0, 0.22) and\n(4.3, 0.21).\nMeasurements for h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i at \u03b2 = 4.6 are shown in\nthe upper row of Fig. 4. Looking at the upper left plot\nof the figure one sees that h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i still has a peak at\nfinite h. The peak becomes narrower and its position\nis shifted from \u03ba = 0.1986 to \u03ba = 0.1981 as the lattice\nsize is increased from 64 to 104 . Taking the results from\nthe 104 lattice at \u03ba = 0.1981, a fit using Eq. (4) can be\nperformed. However, due to low statistics the point at\n\nh = 0.005 was discarded and therefore some fit parameters had to be fixed. Using the fit results from the two\nlower values of \u03b2, the parameter A, B and C were alternately fixed to reasonable values. The extrapolation\nis consistent with a vanishing order parameter (see Table I). The same result is obtained by inspection of the\nFisher plot in Fig. 4 where the data seem to lie on a\nline ending on the abscissa. This means that the order\nparameter h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8ih=0 vanishes at \u03b2 = 4.6.\nIn addition, the parameters B and C agree within errors for all three values of \u03b2 as can be seen from Table I.

In agreement with the results presented above, the order parameter h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8ih=0\nis found to be finite at \u03b2 = 4.0 and \u03b2 = 4.3, while it vanishes at \u03b2 = 4.6.

Stars denote points where a finite value of h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8ih=0 is\n(u)\n(l)\nuncertain. The lines indicate the position of the critical lines \u03bac (\u03b2) and \u03bac (\u03b2). The shaded region labeled B refers to the\nparity-flavor breaking phase. The point (\u03b2, \u03ba)=(4.0, 0.215) marked by a circle seems to lie very close to the border of the broken\nphase.\n\nmatrix. The phase diagram was explored in the rectangle\n4.0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 5.0 and 0.15 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 0.28.\nWe have presented hybrid Monte Carlo results for\nthe order parameter h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i.\nThe existence of\na parity-flavor breaking phase could be confirmed at\n(\u03b2, \u03ba) = (4.0, 0.22) and (4.3, 0.21), where h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i,\nmeasured at finite h, extrapolates to a finite value at\nh = 0 in the infinite volume limit. No parity-flavor breaking was found at \u03b2 = 4.6 and \u03b2 = 5.0. This suggests\na phase structure as shown in Fig. 5. Two squares in\nFig. 5 mark points where we were able to confirm the\nAoki phase. Two stars mark points where h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i has\na peak at finite h, but where our extrapolation to h = 0\nis consistent with a vanishing order parameter. Consequently these stars are labeled vestigial.\nAccording to these results, the Aoki phase for T = 0\nseems to end close to \u03b2 = 4.6 and \u03ba = 0.1981. Rough\n(u)\n(l)\nestimates for the upper \u03bac and lower \u03bac bound of the\nAoki phase are\n\u03b2 = 4.0 : 0.215 \u2243 \u03bac(l) < 0.220 0.220 < \u03ba(u)\n< 0.225\nc\n\u03b2 = 4.3 : 0.205 < \u03bac(l) < 0.210 0.210 < \u03ba(u)\n< 0.215 .\nc\nThe pair (\u03b2, \u03ba) = (4.0, 0.215) seems to be quite close to\nthe lower boundary. We conclude this from the behavior of h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i in conjunction with the behavior of the\npion norm [26] (which also has been measured during our\nsimulations). At this (\u03b2, \u03ba) pair h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i extrapolates\n\nto zero at h = 0, whereas the pion norm seems to diverge\nas h \u2192 0. Such behavior is expected close to critical lines\n\u03bac (\u03b2).\nReferring to the discussion of the anticipated phase\ndiagram in Sec. II, the results presented here do not indicate a parity-flavor breaking phase at \u03b2 \u2265 4.6 which\nwas originally claimed to exist at all \u03b2 (see Fig. 1). This\nis suggested not only by the extrapolation of h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i\nto h = 0 in Sec. IV, which yields h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8ih=0 = 0 at\n\u03b2 = 4.6 and \u03b2 = 5.0, but also by the observation that\nthe peak of h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i decreases in height and width as\n\u03b2 increases. The parity-flavor breaking phase seems to\nbe pinched off near \u03b2 = 4.6 as illustrated in Fig. 5. From\nthe numerical point of view we agree with Bitar [14], who\nhas found no evidence of such a broken phase for \u03b2 \u2265 5.0.\nOn the other hand, although h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i decreases, a\nnon-vanishing value at h = 0 in the infinite volume limit\nis not excluded. A decreasing width could have been\nexpected from the phase structure in Fig. 1. The fact that\nthe peak becomes narrower implies that a high resolution\nscan in \u03ba is required at larger values of \u03b2. In addition,\nlattices much larger than 124 would be needed (which\nis beyond our presently available computing resources).\nWith this in mind it is comprehensible that the results\npresented in Ref. [14] could not indicate a broken phase\nfor \u03b2 \u2265 5.0 just because of the small lattice sizes used\n(64 , 84 and 104 ). While we find no numerical evidence\nfor the existence of the Aoki phase for \u03b2 \u2265 4.6 one cannot\n\n\f8\nexclude that the phase might be found with methods to\nbe invented similar to reweighting.\nA further interesting observation we made is that the\ndata behave differently when approaching the parity(u)\nflavor breaking phase at fixed \u03b2 from \u03ba > \u03bac compared\n(l)\nwith the approach from \u03ba < \u03bac . First, the peaks of\nh\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i as a function of \u03ba are asymmetric. Second, an\nautocorrelation analysis of h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u03c8i shows that measurements to the right of the peak (above of the Aoki\nphase) are significantly stronger correlated than at all\nsmaller \u03ba values.\nIn light of the possible scenarios discussed by Sharpe\nand Singleton [13] it might be worthwhile to invest more\ncomputing power in a study of both the width of the Aoki\nfinger and the detailed behavior of the neutral pion mass\ninside and outside the Aoki phase with respect to the lattice spacing dependence. For the case of Nf = 2 dynamical (unimproved) Wilson fermions with standard Wilson\ngauge action, however, the impossibility of matching the\n\n\u03c0 and \u03c1 masses in the interval 3.5 < \u03b2 < 5.3 is known [27],\nwhich means that scaling is strongly violated. Thus the\nresult of the present paper, confining the Aoki phase to\n\u03b2 < 4.6, unfortunately does not allow this potentially\ninteresting comparison with chiral perturbation theory.\nIn view of the fact that the region above the Aoki phase\n(u)\n(\u03ba > \u03bac ) is the region of interest for the insertion of\nthe Wilson-Dirac operator into the overlap form [3] of\nthe massless fermion operator an even more extensive\ninvestigation of this area might be worthwhile to do.\n\n[1] P.
