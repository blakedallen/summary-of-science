A given\nstate is nonlocal when it violates any Bell's inequality.\nIn fact, a state does not have to violate all the possible\nBell's inequalities to be considered quantum nonlocal. A\nstate is quantum nonlocal for the given Bell's inequality\nwhich is violated by the measurement of the state. Banaszek and W\u00f3dkiewicz defined Bell's inequality based\non the parity measurement and they found that the twomode squeezed state violates the Bell's inequality, showing quantum nonlocality [15].\nIn this paper we study the dynamic behavior of the\nquantum nonlocality based on the parity measurement\nfor the two-mode squeezed state in the thermal environment. A measurement of the degree of quantum nonlocality is defined here by the maximal violation of Bell's\ninequality. The nonlocality is stronger for the squeezed\nstate with a larger degree of squeezing. It is found that\nthe nonlocality disappears more rapidly in the thermal\nenvironment as the initial state is squeezed more.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, Bell's\ninequality based on the parity measurement is discussed.\nThe parity measurement is directly related to the Wigner\nfunction. In Sec. III, the two-mode master equation is\nsolved for the dynamics of the Wigner function of the\ninitial two-mode squeezed state. The convolution theory is utilized in the solution [16]. We investigate the\ndynamic behavior of the quantum nonlocality measured\nby the maximum violation of Bell's inequality for the\ntwo-mode squeezed state in the thermal environment in\nSec. IV.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nQuantum nonlocality is one of the most profound features of quantum mechanics [1,2]. It enables current developments of quantum information theory encompassing\nquantum teleportation [3\u20138], quantum computation [9],\nand quantum cryptography [10]. There have been studies\non tests of quantum nonlocality versus local realism. Bell\nsuggested an inequality which any local hidden variable\ntheory must obey [2]. Several types of Bell's inequalities\nwere derived in terms of two-body correlation functions\nof two measurement variables at distant places [11] for\nthe test of quantum nonlocality of a spin-1/2 or SU(2)\nsystem.\nA spin-1/2 system can be utilized as a qubit for quantum computation. Quantum nonlocality of the spin-1/2\nsystem is required as a quantum channel to teleport an\nunknown qubit state [3,12]. In fact, it is possible to\nteleport not only a two-dimensional spin-1/2 quantum\nstate but also a N -dimensional state [4] and a continuousvariable state [5]. The type of the quantum channel depends on the dimension of Hilbert space of an unknown\nquantum state. For the teleportation of a continuousvariable state, the quantum channel should be in an entangled continuous-variable state such as the two-mode\nsqueezed state [6]. Recently, practical implementation\nof the quantum teleportation for the continuous-variable\nstate has been realized experimentally using the twomode squeezed field [7,8]. In the quantum teleportation,\nthe most important ingredient is the quantum nonlocality of the channel which can be easily destroyed in the\nnature. In this paper we are interested in how the thermal environment affects the quantum nonlocality of the\ntwo-mode squeezed field.\nQuantum nonlocality of an entangled continuousvariable state has been discussed using the Schmidt\n1\n\n\fderive that the local hidden variable theory imposes the\nfollowing Bell's inequality [15]\n\nII. BELL'S INEQUALITY BY PARITY\nMEASUREMENT\n\n|B(\u03b1, \u03b2)| \u2261 |h\u03a0\u0302ab (\u03b1, \u03b2) + \u03a0\u0302ab (\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2032 )\n+\u03a0\u0302ab (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2) \u2212 \u03a0\u0302ab (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 )i| \u2264 2\n\nIt is important to choose the type of measurement variables when testing nonlocality for a given state. In the\noriginal EPR gedanken experiment [1], Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen considered the positions (or the momenta)\nof two particles as the measurement variables to discuss\nthe two-body correlation. Bell [2] argued that the EPR\nwave function does not exhibit nonlocality because its\nWigner function W (x1 , p1 ; x2 , p2 ) is positive everywhere,\nallowing the description by a local hidden variable theory. Munro showed that various types of Bell's inequalities are not violated in terms of the homodyne measurements of two particles [14,17]. To the contrary, Banaszek\nand W\u00f3dkiewicz [15] examined even and odd parities as\nthe measurement variables and showed that the EPR\nstate and the two-mode squeezed state are nonlocal in the\nsense that they violate Bell's inequalities such as Clauser\nand Horne inequality and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\ninequality.\nThe even and odd parity operators, \u00d4e and \u00d4o , are the\nprojection operators to measure the probabilities of the\nfield having even and odd numbers of photons, respectively:\n\u00d4e =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\n|2nih2n| ;\n\n\u00d4o =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nwhere we call B(\u03b1, \u03b2) as the Bell function.\nBy a simple extension of the relation (3), the two-mode\nWigner function is found to be proportional to the mean\nof \u03a0\u0302ab such that W (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (4/\u03c0 2 ) Tr[\u03c1\u0302ab \u03a0\u0302ab (\u03b1, \u03b2)] for\nthe two-mode state of the density operator \u03c1\u0302ab . The Bell\nfunction (6) can then be written in terms of the Wigner\nfunctions at different phase-space points,\nB(\u03b1, \u03b2) =\n\nThe Wigner function at the origin of phase space for a\nstate of the density operator \u03c1\u0302 is proportional to the mean\nparity [18]:\nh\ni\nW (0) = (2/\u03c0)Tr (\u00d4e \u2212 \u00d4o )\u03c1\u0302 .\n(2)\n\nIII. TIME EVOLUTION OF TWO-MODE\nSQUEEZED STATES IN THERMAL\nENVIRONMENT\n\nFurther, the Wigner function W (\u03b1) at the phase point \u03b1\nis the mean parity for the displaced original state\n\nThe two-mode squeezed state is the correlated state of\ntwo field modes a and b that can be generated by a nonlinear \u03c7(2) medium [19,20]. The two-mode pure squeezed\nstate is obtained by applying the unitary operator on the\ntwo-mode vacuum\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(8)\n|\u03a8ab (\u03c3)i = exp \u2212\u03c3\u00e2b\u0302 + \u03c3 \u2217 b\u0302\u2020 \u00e2\u2020 |0a , 0b i\n\n(3)\n\nwhere D\u0302(\u03b1) is the displacement operator [18].\nSo far the argument has been confined to the parity\nmeasurement of a single-mode field. As the quantum\nnonlocality can be discussed for two-mode fields, we thus\ndefine the quantum correlation operator based on the\njoint parity measurements:\n\u03a0\u0302ab (\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u03a0\u0302ae (\u03b1)\u03a0\u0302be (\u03b2) \u2212 \u03a0\u0302ae (\u03b1)\u03a0\u0302bo (\u03b2)\n\u2212\u03a0\u0302ao (\u03b1)\u03a0\u0302be (\u03b2) + \u03a0\u0302ao (\u03b1)\u03a0\u0302bo (\u03b2)\n\nwhere \u03c3 = s exp(\u2212i\u03c6) and \u00e2 (b\u0302) is an annihilation operator for the mode a (b). The value of s determines the\ndegree of squeezing. The larger s is, the more the state\nis squeezed.\nThe Wigner function corresponding to the squeezed\nstate is the Fourier transform of its characteristic function CW (\u03b6, \u03b7) [20],\nn\no\nCW (\u03b6, \u03b7) = Tr \u03c1\u0302 exp(\u03b6\u00e2\u2020 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2217 \u00e2) exp(\u03b7 b\u0302\u2020 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2217 b\u0302) . (9)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the superscripts a and b denote the modes and the\ndisplaced parity operator, \u03a0e,o (\u03b1), is defined as\n\u03a0\u0302e,o (\u03b1) = D\u0302(\u03b1)\u00d4e,o D\u0302\u2020 (\u03b1).\n\n\u03c02\n[W (0, 0) + W (\u03b1, 0) + W (0, \u03b2) \u2212 W (\u03b1, \u03b2)] .\n4\n(7)\n\nThe type of Bell's inequality in Eq. (6) was first discussed\nby Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt [11]. Clauser and\nHorne later found another type of inequality which can\nbe also expressed in phase space using the quasiprobability Q function [15]. The Q function is related to the\nprobability of the state having no photons. The lower\nand upper critical values of the Clauser-Horne Bell's inequality is -1 and 0.\nWe have seen that the two-mode Wigner function is\nuseful to test quantum nonlocality of the given field so\nthat, in the next section, we find the evolution of the\nWigner function for the initial two-mode squeezed state\ncoupled with the thermal environment.\n\n|2n + 1ih2n + 1|.

When cos \u03b8 = \u22121, the Bell function\nBm (|\u03b1|, |\u03b2|, \u03c4 ) is described by the absolute values |\u03b1| and\n|\u03b2|. Bm is symmetric in exchanging \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that\nBm (|\u03b1|, |\u03b2|, \u03c4 ) = Bm (|\u03b2|, |\u03b1|, \u03c4 ). It is straightforward to\nshow that B \u2264 Bm at any instance of time \u03c4 . In order to find the evolution of the nonlocality, the maximal\nvalue |B|max of the Bell function B is calculated by the\nsteepest decent method [21] and using the properties of\nBm (|\u03b1|, |\u03b2|, \u03c4 ). We say the field is quantum-mechanically\nnonlocal as |B|max is larger than 2 and the nonlocality is\nstronger as |B|max gets larger.\nThe initial two-mode squeezed state is always nonlocal\nas |B|max > 2 for s > 0. |B|max increases monotonously\nas the degree s of squeezing increases. The state becomes\nmaximally nonlocal with |B|max \u223c 2.19055 as s \u2192 \u221e\n[15]. In an intermediate time 0 < \u03c4 < \u221e, the pure\nsqueezed state evolves to a two-mode mixed squeezed\nstate and nonlocality is lost at a certain evolution time.\nFigs. 1 and 2 show |B|max versus the dimensionless time\nr(\u03c4 ) defined in Eq. (12). We find that the nonlocality\ninitially prepared persists until the characteristic time\n\u03c4c (s, n\u0304) depending on the temperature of the thermal environment and the initial squeezing. In Fig. 1 it is found\nthat, when the environment is the vacuum, |B|max decreases as time proceeds. After reaching at the minimum\nvalue, |B|max increases to 2 which is the value of |B|max\nfor the vacuum. Even though it is not clearly seen in the\n\nPerforming the integration in Eq.

The two-mode\nsqueezed state is coupled with the n\u0304 = 0 vacuum (a) and the\nn\u0304 = 1 thermal environment (b). In the vacuum, the larger\nthe degree of squeezing is, the more rapidly the nonlocality\nis lost. In the n\u0304 = 1 thermal environment, we find that the\nnonlocality persists longer when the squeezing is s \u223c 0.5.\n\nwhere the Gaussian weight function\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\n1 \u2212 tanh s\n\u22121\n2\nG(\u03b1, \u03c3) = (\u03c0 sinh s) exp \u2212\n|\u03b1| .

The uncertainty increases faster as the degree\nof squeezing is larger. This can be explained using the\nsame argument as the lost of quantum nonlocality.\nIn Fig. 2(a), when the environment is in the vacuum,\nit is found that the characteristic time \u03c4c (s, n\u0304) to lose\nthe quantum nonlocality is shorter as the initial degree\nof squeezing is larger. In Fig. 2(b), when the non-zero\ntemperature thermal environment (n\u0304 6= 0) is concerned,\nwe find that the larger degree of squeezing does not necessarily result in the shorter characteristic time \u03c4c (s, n\u0304).\n\nAs s gets larger, the weight of a large \u03b1 state is greater so\nthat the contribution of |\u03b1, \u03b1\u2217 ei\u03c6 i of a large \u03b1 becomes\nmore important in the continuous superposition (19).\nThe quantum interference between coherent component states is the key of quantum nature of the field.\nThe quantum interference is destroyed by the environment. The speed of destruction depends on the distance\nbetween the coherent component states and the average\nthermal energy of the environment [23]. This is a reason why the macroscopic quantum superposition state\nis not easily seen in the nature. In the continuous superposition (19) we find that as the degree of squeezing\nis larger, the superposition extends further so that the\n4\n\n\fThis clearly shows that the characteristic time is a function of the average number of thermal photons as well\nas the degree of squeezing. However, it is still true that\n|B|max decreases faster (the slope of its curve is steeper)\nwhen s is larger. It is also found that |B|max decreases\nfaster for n\u0304 6= 0 than for n\u0304 = 0.\nWe have studied the dynamic behavior of the nonlocality for the two-mode squeezed state in the thermal\nenvironment. The two-mode squeezed state can be used\nfor the quantum channel in quantum teleportation of a\ncontinuous variable state. The two-mode squeezed state\nis found to be a nonlocal state regardless of its degree of\nsqueezing and the higher degree of squeezing brings about\nthe larger quantum nonlocality. As the squeezed state is\ninfluenced by the thermal environment the nonlocality is\nlost. The rapidity of the loss of nonlocality depends on\nthe initial degree of squeezing and the average thermal\nenergy of the environment. The more strongly the initial\nfield is squeezed, the more rapidly the maximum nonlocality decreases. This has been analyzed extensively.\n\n[13]\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n[22]\n\nWe thank Professor J.W. Noh for bringing Ref. [6,8]\nto our attention.
