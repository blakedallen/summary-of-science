The apparatus is in\nstable data taking since November 2007 at the YangBaJing Cosmic\nRay Laboratory (Tibet, P.R. China, 4300 m a.s.l., 606 g/cm2 ). In\nthis paper we report the main results in Gamma-Ray Astronomy and\nCosmic Ray Physics after about 3 years of operations.\n\n1\n\nThe detector\n\nThe ARGO-YBJ experiment, located at the YangBaJing Cosmic Ray Laboratory (Tibet, P.R. China, 4300 m a.s.l., 606 g/cm2 ), is the only air shower\narray exploiting the full-coverage approach at very high altitude currently\nat work. ARGO-YBJ is a multipurpose detector which faces a wide range\nof fundamental issues in Cosmic Ray and Astroparticle Physics with a low\nenergy threshold (a few hundred GeV).\nThe apparatus is constituted by a central carpet \u223c74\u00d7 78 m2 , made of a\nsingle layer of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) with \u223c93% of active area,\nenclosed by a guard ring partially instrumented (\u223c20%) up to \u223c100\u00d7110\nm2 . The apparatus has a modular structure, the basic data acquisition element being a cluster (5.7\u00d77.6 m2 ), made of 12 RPCs (2.8\u00d71.25 m2 each).\n1\n\n\f\u03b4-\u03b4m (\u00b0)\n\n4\n\n0\n\n3\n-10\n\n2\n1\n\n-20\n\n0\n-30\n\n-1\n-40\n\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-4\n\n-50\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1 2\n3\n4\n(\u03b1-\u03b1m)cos\u03b4m (\u00b0)\n\nFigure 1: Left plot: Moon shadow significance map for events with N\u2265100. The\ncolor scale gives the significance. Right plot: the ratio of the observed deficit counts\nto the expected ones as a function of the observation time.\n\nEach chamber is read by 80 external strips of 6.75\u00d761.8 cm2 (the spatial\npixels), logically organized in 10 independent pads of 55.6\u00d761.8 cm2 which\nrepresent the time pixels of the detector. The read-out of 18360 pads and\n146880 strips are the experimental output of the detector (Aielli G. et al.,\n2006). The RPCs are operated in streamer mode by using a gas mixture (Ar\n15%, Isobutane 10%, TetraFluoroEthane 75%) for high altitude operation.\nThe high voltage settled at 7.2 kV ensures an overall efficiency of about 96%\n(Aielli G. et al., 2009a). The full detector is composed of 153 clusters for a\ntotal active surface of \u223c6700 m2 . The detector is connected to two different\ndata acquisition systems, working independently, and corresponding to the\ntwo operation modes, shower and scaler. In shower mode, for each event the\nlocation and timing of every detected particle is recorded, allowing the reconstruction of the lateral distribution and the arrival direction (Di Sciascio\nG. et al., 2007). In scaler mode the total counts on each cluster are measured every 0.5 s, with limited information on both the space distribution\nand arrival direction of the detected particles, in order to lower the energy\nthreshold down to \u223c1 GeV (Aielli G. et al., 2008, 2009b, 2009c).\nSince November 2007 the detector is in stable data taking with a multiplicity trigger Npad \u226520 and a duty cycle \u2265 85%: the trigger rate is about\n3.6 kHz. In this paper we report the main results in Gamma-Ray Astronomy\nand Cosmic Ray Physics after about 3 years of operations.\n\n\f1.1\n\nDetector performance\n\nThe performance of the detector and the operation stability are continuously\nmonitored by observing the Moon shadow, i.e., the deficit of cosmic rays\n(CR) detected in its direction. Indeed, the size of the deficit allows the\nmeasurement of the angular resolution and its position allows the evaluation\nof the absolute pointing accuracy of the detector. In addition, positively\ncharged particles are deflected towards East due to the geomagnetic field by\nan angle \u223c 1.6\u25e6 Z/E[T eV ]. Therefore, the observation of the displacement\nof the Moon provides a direct calibration of the relation between shower size\nand primary energy.\nOn the left side of Fig.1 a significance map of the Moon region is shown.\nWith all data from July 2006 to December 2009 (about 3200 hours on-source\nin total) we observed the CR Moon shadowing effect with a significance\nof about 55 standard deviations (s.d.). The measured angular resolution\nis better than 0.5\u25e6 for showers with energies E > 5 TeV and the overall\nabsolute pointing accuracy is at a level of \u223c0.1\u25e6 . The energy scale error\nof ARGO-YBJ is estimated to be less than 18% in the energy range 1 - 30\nTeV/Z. On the right side of Fig.1 the ratio of the observed deficit count\nto the expected one evaluated on a monthly basis is shown as a function\nof the observation time for events with N>100. The amount of CR deficit\nprovides a good measure of the size of the shadow, therefore of the angular\nresolution. The resulting stability of the event deficit is at a level of 10% in\nthe period November 2007 - March 2010.\n\n2\n\nGamma-Ray Astronomy\n\nWith about 2 years of data we observed 3 sources with a significance greater\nthan 5 s.d.: Crab Nebula, Mrk421 and MGRO J1908+06.\nWe observed the Crab signal with a significance of 14 s.d. in about\n800 days at a median energy of \u223c2 TeV, without any event selection or\ngamma/hadron discrimination algorithm. In Fig.2 the energy spectrum of\nthe Crab Nebula measured by the ARGO-YBJ experiment is compared to\nother observations. The data can be parameterized with the formula: dN/dE\n= (4.1\u00b10.6)*10\u221211 * (E/1 TeV)\u22122.7\u00b10.2 cm\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121 . Our result is in good\nagreement with other experiments.\nMrk421 was the first source detected by the ARGO-YBJ experiment in\nJuly 2006 when the detector started recording data with only the central\ncarpet and was in commissioning phase. In the last 2 years we observed the\n\n\f2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nCumulative count rate of RXTE\n\n1000\n20000\n\n800\n600\n10000\n\n400\n200\n0\n-100\n\nFigure 2: The Crab Nebula energy\nspectrum measured by ARGO-YBJ\ncompared with the results of some\nother detectors.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300 400\n500\nMJD-54466\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nFigure 3: Cumulative light curve from\nMrk421 measured by ARGO-YBJ compared with RXTE/ASM (black curve)\nand Swfit (blue curve) X-ray data.\n\nblazar Mrk421 with a total significance of about 12 s.d., averaging over quiet\nand active periods. Indeed, as it is well known, this AGN is characterized\nby a strong flaring activity both in X-rays and in TeV \u03b3-rays. ARGO-YBJ\ndetected different TeV flares in correlation with X-ray observations, as can\nbe seen from Fig. 3 where the ARGO-YBJ cumulative events per day is\ncompared with the cumulative events per second of the RXTE/ASM and\nSwift satellites. To get simultaneous data, 556 days have been selected for\nthis analysis. The X-ray/TeV correlation is quite evident over more than\n2 years. The steepness of the curve gives the flux variation, therefore we\nobserved an active period at the beginning of 2008 followed by a quiet phase.\nCross-correlation functions were measured to quantify the degree of correlation and the phase difference (time lag) between the variations in X-ray\nand TeV bands, using the Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) of Edelson\n& Krolik (1998). The DCF gives the linear correlation coefficient for two\nlight curves as a function of the time lag between them. For X-rays we consider two different bands (2-12 and 9-15 keV). The distributions peak around\nzero and the correlation coefficients around zero are \u223c0.78. The peak positions, evaluated by fitting the distributions with a Gaussian function around\n+1.05\nthe maximum, are -0.14+0.86\n\u22120.85 and -0.94\u22121.07 days for RXTE/ASM and Swift\ndata, respectively. Therefore, no significant time lag is found between X-ray\ndata and TeV ARGO-YBJ observations.\nIn order to study the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of Mrk421\nat different flux levels, both X-ray and TeV data have been divided into 4\n\nCumulative events of ARGO-YBJ\n\n1200\n\n\fDifferential spectral index\n\n-1.6\n-1.8\n-2\n-2.2\n-2.4\n-2.6\n-2.8\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\nFlux >1 TeV [Crab]\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFigure 4: Mrk421 spectral index vs.\nflux above 1 TeV in Crab units. The\nsolid line is the function obtained in\nKrennrich F. et al. (2002).\n\nFigure 5: ARGO-YBJ >1 TeV flux vs.\nRXTE/ASM X-ray flux. Solid line:\nquadratic best-fit (\u03c72 /dof= 1.9/2).\nDotted line: linear best-fit (\u03c72 /dof=\n7.7/2).\n\nbands based on the RXTE/ASM counting rate: 0-2, 2-3, 3-5, >5 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nFor each band a SED with the average flux is calculated for different Xray and \u03b3-ray energies. The RXTE/ASM detector is monitoring Mrk421 in\nthree energy bands: 1.5-3, 3-5 and 5-12 keV. By assuming a power-law Xray energy spectrum we calculated the spectral indices in the 4 flux bands:\n-2.02\u00b10.08, -2.05\u00b10.03, -2.15\u00b10.03 and -2.43\u00b10.04. A correlation is clearly\nrecognized in the sense that higher fluxes are accompanied by harder energy\nspectra. This result, obtained by averaging the Mrk421 emission over about\n2 years, extends similar conclusions obtained by averaging observations over\nmuch shorter periods (Rebillot P.F. et al., 2006).\nWith this information we studied the relation between TeV spectral index and flux. The TeV flux measured by ARGO-YBJ in the different bands\nranges from 0.9 to about 7 Crab units. As shown in Fig. 4 the TeV spectral\nindex hardens with increasing flux in agreement with the results obtained\nby the Whipple collaboration in 2002 (continuous line) (Krennrich F. et al.,\n2002). This conclusion generalizes our result obtained with the analysis of\nthe June 2008 flare (Aielli G. et al., 2010).\nWe investigated also the correlation between RXTE/ASM X-ray and\nARGO-YBJ TeV fluxes (Fig. 5). A positive correlation is clearly observed\nand the X-ray/TeV relation seems to be quadratic rather than linear, in\nagreement with the results of Fossati G. et al. (1998).\nMGRO J1908+06 is a Pulsar Wind Nebula discovered by Milagro at\n\n\fFigure 6: Medium scale anisotropy of CRs at energies \u223c2 TeV. The color scale\ngives the statistical significance in standard deviations.\n\na median energy of \u223c20 TeV. Later, the Cherenkov telescopes HESS and\nVERITAS confirmed this observation. The Milagro and HESS energy spectra are in disagreement (Smith A.J. et al. 2009) probably due to the intrinsic\nextension of the source. ARGO-YBJ observed a TeV emission from MGRO\nJ1908+06 with a significance of 6 s.d. in about 800 days. We estimated its\nintrinsic extension in 0.48\u00b10.28 deg, in agreement with the HESS determination. With this information we calculated a preliminary energy spectrum:\ndN/dE = (3.6\u00b10.8)*10\u221213 *(E/6 TeV)\u22122.2\u00b10.3 cm\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121 in the energy\nrange 1-30 TeV. This spectrum is consistent with that measured by Milagro,\nin particular around 10 TeV, but is not consistent with the HESS calculation. The ARGO-YBJ data are not yet sensitive to the presence of an energy\ncutoff.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nCosmic Ray Physics\nMedium and Large scale anisotropies\n\nFig. 6 shows the sky map for events with N>40 and zenith angle \u03b8 < 40\u25e6\n(corresponding to a proton median energy \u223c2 TeV), obtained with a 5\u25e6\nsmoothing radius. The analysis has been performed in order to be insensitive to the CR large scale anisotropy which is roughly one order of magnitude greater. The map clearly shows two large hot spots in the region of\n\n\fFigure 7: Large scale CR anisotropy observed by ARGO-YBJ at energies \u223c2 TeV.\nIn the upper plot the color scale gives the relative CR intensity, in the lower plot\nthe statistical significance in standard deviations.\n\nthe Galactic anticenter. The two excesses (>10 s.d., corresponding to a flux\nincrease of \u223c0.1%) are observed by ARGO-YBJ around the positions \u03b1 \u223c\n120\u25e6 , \u03b4 \u223c 40\u25e6 and \u03b1 \u223c 60\u25e6 , \u03b4 \u223c -5\u25e6 , in agreement with a similar detection reported by the Milagro Collaboration (Abdo A.A. et al., 2008). However, the\nmaximum of the second excess is slightly shifted towards lower declinations,\nprobably because ARGO-YBJ can observe the southern regions of the sky\nwith more efficiency, being located at a lower latitude than Milagro. The\ndeficit regions parallel to the excesses are due to a known effect of the analysis, that uses also the excess events to evaluate the background, artificially\nincreasing the background. The origin of this medium-scale anisotropy is\npuzzling. In fact, these regions have been interpreted as excesses of hadronic\nCRs, but TeV CRs are expected to be randomized by the magnetic fields.\nUnderstanding these anisotropies should be a high priority as they are probably due to a nearby source of CRs, as suggested by some authors (e.g.,\nMarkov M.A. et al., 2010).\nWith 2 years of data we carried out a 2D measurement to investigate\nthe detailed structural information of the large scale CR anisotropy beyond\nthe simple Right Ascension (R.A.) profiles. The so-called 'tail-in' and 'losscone' regions, correlated to an enhancement or deficit of CRs, are clearly\nvisible with a significance of about 20 s.d. (Fig. 7).

The\nmedium-scale anisotropy of Fig. 6 is contained in the two hot spots in the\nlarge-scale anisotropy tail-in region. A new excess component with a \u223c0.1%\nincrease of the CR intensity in the Cygnus region is observed with a significance of about 10 s.d.. To quantify the scale of the anisotropy we fitted the\n1D R.A. projection of the 2D map with the first two harmonics for three different energies. The preliminary results (E = 0.7 TeV, A1 =(3.6\u00b10.1)*10\u22124 ,\n\u03c61 =63.4\u25e6 \u00b10.9; E = 1.5 TeV, A1 =(6.8\u00b10.1)*10\u22124 , \u03c61 =41.0\u25e6 \u00b10.7; E = 3.9\nTeV, A1 =(9.0\u00b10.1)*10\u22124 , \u03c61 =35.3\u25e6 \u00b10.6) are in good agreement with other\nexperiments (Guillian G. et al., 2007).\n\n3.2\n\n5\n\n10\n104\nenergy (GeV)\n\nMeasurement of the light component spectrum of CRs\n\nThe differential energy spectrum of the primary CR light component (p+He)\nmeasured by ARGO-YBJ (filled triangles) in the energy region (5 - 250) TeV\nby using a Bayesian unfolding approach is compared with other experiments\nin Fig. 8. We selected showers with zenith angle \u03b8 <30\u25e6 and with reconstructed core position inside a fiducial area 50\u00d750 m2 large by applying a\nselection criterion based on the particle density. In the energy range investigated the contamination of heavier nuclei is found to be negligible, not\nexceeding a few percent. The ARGO-YBJ data agree remarkably well with\nthe values obtained by adding up the proton and helium fluxes measured by\nCREAM both concerning the total intensities and the spectrum (Ahn H.S.\n\n\fet al., 2010). The value of the spectral index of the power-law fit representing the ARGO-YBJ data is -2.61\u00b10.04, which should be compared to \u03b3p =\n-2.66\u00b10.02 and \u03b3He = -2.58\u00b10.02 obtained by CREAM. The present analysis does not allow the determination of the individual proton and Helium\ncontribution to the measured flux, but the ARGO-YBJ data are mainly induced by protons since the average energy of Helium primaries contributing\nto events with a given multiplicity is about 1.5 - 2 times greater than the average proton energy. This result suggests a possible hardening of the proton\nspectrum at energies >5 TeV with respect to that obtained at lower energies from direct measurements with satellites and balloon-borne detectors.\nWe emphasize that for the first time direct and ground-based measurements\noverlap for a wide energy range thus making possible the cross-calibration\nof the different experimental techniques.\n\n3.3\n\nMeasurement of the p/p ratio at TeV energies\n\nIn order to measure the p/p ratio at TeV energies we exploit the EarthMoon system as an ion spectrometer: if protons are deflected towards East,\nantiprotons are deflected towards West. If the energy is low enough and\nthe angular resolution small we can distinguish, in principle, between two\nshadows, one shifted towards West due to the protons and the other shifted\ntowards East due to the antiprotons. If no event deficit is observed on the\nantimatter side an upper limit on the antiproton content can be calculated.\nWe selected 2 multiplicity bins, 40<N<100 and N>100. In the first interval the statistical significance of the Moon shadow is 34 s.d., the measured\nangular resolution is \u223c1\u25e6 and the median energy is 1.4 TeV. For N>100 the\nsignificance is 55 s.d., the angular resolution is \u223c0.6\u25e6 and the median energy\nis 5 TeV. Taking into account that at these energies protons are about 70%\nof CRs, with all the data up to December 2009 we set two upper limits to\nthe p/p ratio at the 90% confidence level: 5% at 1.4 TeV and 6% at 5 TeV.\nSince the spectral index of antiprotons around the energy range of interest\nis unknown, there is no reason to assume the proton spectral index. Many\nunknown factors contribute to its value, mostly related to the diffusion coefficient inside the Galaxy. To investigate this point, different spectral indices\nwere considered for primary antiprotons, \u03b3= 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 3.0. The\nlimits of the antiproton/proton ratio vary of 20% - 30% with the spectral index, suggesting further studies on the possibility of setting some constraints\non the diffusion coefficient of the CR propagation model.\nThe upper limits calculated with ARGO-YBJ are compared in Fig. 9\n\n\fwith all the available p/p measurements and with some theoretical models\nfor antiprotons production. The solid curves refer to a direct production\nmodel. The dashed lines refer to a model of primary p\u0304 production by antigalaxies (Stecker F.W. and Wolfendale A.W., 1985). The rigidity-dependent\nconfinement of cosmic rays in the Galaxy is assumed to be \u221d R\u2212\u03b4 , and the\ntwo dashed curves correspond to the cases of \u03b4 = 0.6, 0.7. The dotted line\nrefers to the contribution from a heavy Dark Matter particle annihilation\n(Cirelli M. et al., 2009). We note that in the few-TeV range the ARGO-YBJ\nresults are the lowest available, useful to constrain models for antiproton\nproduction in antimatter domains.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe ARGO-YBJ experiment is in stable data taking since November 2007\nwith a duty cycle >85% and with excellent performance. We observed the\nCR Moon and Sun shadows with a significance of 55 s.d. and 45 s.d.,\nrespectively. The detector performance is continuously monitored with the\nMoon shadow technique. The energy scale error is estimated less than 18%\nand the overall absolute pointing error less than 0.1\u25e6 . The angular resolution\nhas been stable at a level better than 10% over the last 2 years.\nSeveral interesting results are already available in cosmic ray physics as\nwell as in gamma ray astronomy with the first 2 years of data.\nWe observed TeV emission from 3 sources with a significance greater\nthan 5 s.d.: Crab Nebula, Mrk421 and MGRO J1908+06. In particular\nwe observed the Crab Nebula with a significance of 14 s.d. in \u223c800 days.\nA detailed long-term monitoring of the Mrk421 flaring activity has been\ncarried out in the last 2 years. A clear correlation with X-ray data was\nfound. The relation between spectral index and flux has been studied in one\nsingle flare (June 2008) and averaging the data over 2 years.\nA medium-scale anisotropy has been observed with a significance greater\nthan 10 s.d. at proton median energy of about 2 TeV. With 2 years of data we\ncarried out a 2D measurement of the CR large-scale anisotropy to investigate\ndetailed structural information beyond the simple Right Ascension profiles.\nWe found a good agreement with other experiments.\nThe light-component (p+He) spectrum of primary CRs has been measured in the range 5 - 250 TeV. The preliminary results are in good agreement\nwith the CREAM balloon data. For the first time direct and ground-based\nmeasurements overlap for a wide energy range thus making possible the\n\n\fcross-calibration of the different experimental techniques.\nA measurement of the p/p ratio at few-TeV energies has been performed\nsetting two upper limits at the 90% confidence level: 5% at 1.4 TeV and 6%\nat 5 TeV. In the few-TeV range these results are the lowest available, useful\nto constrain models for antiproton production in antimatter domains.\n\nReferences\n[1] Abdo A.A et al.: 2008, Phys. Rev.

PAREDES: Fermi and AGILE detected Cygnus X-3 recently.\nDid ARGO-YBJ detect any hint of signal from Cygnus X-3 at the epoch of\nthe Agile and Fermi detections ?\nG. DI SCIASCIO: The monitoring of Cygnus X-3 is under way on different\ntime scales. So far no clear detection at 5 standard deviation level has been\nobserved in coincidence with satellite observations.\nA. ERLYKIN: How do you distinguish showers from light nuclei from\nthose from heavier nuclei ?\nG. DI SCIASCIO: In the investigated energy range (5 - 250 TeV) the\ncontribution of nuclei heavier than Helium to the ARGO-YBJ trigger is estimated less than 10%. After selecting internal events by applying a criterion\nbased on the particle density around the shower core, the contamination of\nheavier nuclei is found not exceeding a few percent.\nT. MONTARULI: What is your sensitivity to the Crab Nebula ?\nG. DI SCIASCIO: We observed the Crab Nebula with a significance of 14\ns.d. in about 800 days, that is with a sensitivity of \u223c50% of the Crab flux\nper year, without any internal event selection or \u03b3/hadron discrimination\ntechnique.\n\n\f"}
