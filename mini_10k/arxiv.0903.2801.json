We give a finite dimensional approach to the Chas-Sullivan product on the free\nloop space of a manifold, orientable or not, compact or not.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet M be an n-dimensional manifold with empty boundary; it is not required to be either\ncompact or orientable. Denote LM = C \u221e (S 1 , M) be its free loop space. In a famous paper [4],\nin the case when M is an orientable and closed manifold, M. Chas and D. Sullivan constructed\na natural graded algebra structure on the homology H\u2217 (LM; Z), more precisely a product\nHi (LM; Z) \u2297 Hj (LM; Z) \u2192 Hi+j\u2212n (LM; Z),\nin the same intersection spirit as the usual intersection product on H\u2217 (M; Z). But their ideas\nremained not completely accomplished. A different approach has been considered by R. Cohen\nand J. Jones in [6]. According to their abstract, they describe \"a realization of the Chas-Sullivan\nproduct in terms of a ring spectrum structure on the Thom spectrum of a certain virtual bundle\nover the loop space\", a difficult technique indeed. Recently in [8], Y. F\u00e9lix and J.-C. Thomas\nhave put String Topology into a broad homotopy theoretical setting; they prove that the operations in string topology are preserved by homotopy equivalence, at least in the 1-connected\ncase. On the contrary, in the present note we propose a finite dimensional approach, very close\nto the spirit of [4], based on transversality arguments. We also treat the case of a non-orientable\nmanifold using local coefficients instead of Z.\nWe do not think of LM as a topological space but as a simplicial set (except in section 4). A\nk-simplex in LM is a smooth map \u03a3 : \u2206k \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 M where \u2206k is the standard k-simplex. Let\n0 be the base point of S 1 = R/Z. The evaluation map ev0 : LM \u2192 M is simplicial: ev0 (\u03a3) = \u03c3\nwhere \u03c3 : \u2206k \u2192 M is the k-simplex of M defined by\n\u03c3(t) = \u03a3(t, 0).\nIt is easy to form a chain complex based on the simplices of LM and a bi-complex based on\nbi-simplices (pairs of simplices). In order to take into account the non-orientabiliy, we limit\nourselves to small simplices and bi-simplices (see 2.1). To define an intersection product we consider transverse bi-simplexes. By Thom's transversality theorem, they generate a sub-bicomplex\nwhich has the same homology as LM \u00d7 LM. As we shall see, smallness (resp. transversality\nproperty) will only refer to the image of simplices (resp. bi-simplices) through the evaluation\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 55N10, 57R19, 57R45.\nKey words and phrases.

Let us introduce the sub-bicomplex LM \u00d7 LM of LM \u00d7 LM made of composable loops,\nM\n\nthat is, pairs of loops having a common origin. Performing the composition yields a well defined\nmap in homology LM \u00d7 M \u2192 LM The intersection product will be not far from being defined\nM\n\non the chain level: the intersection of two transverse cycles in LM will produce a \"singular\"\nsmooth manifold W in LM \u00d7 LM, hence in LM after composing, which becomes a simplicial\nM\n\ncycle once W is triangulated. According to Whitehead [13], such a triangulation is unique up\nto subdivision and isotopy. Therefore the product is well defined at the homology level.\nIn last section it is shown that this definition of the free loop product is not less efficient\nthan the \"infinite dimensional\" one when calculations are performed in concrete geometric situations. Results due to different authors (M. Goresky, N. Hingston in [9], D. Chataur, J.-F. Le\nBorgne in [5]) are rewritten in this setting.\nAcknowledgments. I had the chance to hear Dennis Sullivan lecturing on this subject on\nthe occasion of his Doctorat Honoris Causa at \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Lyon) in Dec. 2001.\nLater on, I had fruitful conversations with David Chataur and Hossein Abbaspour who gave\nme more details. I feel indebted to all of them. I am also grateful to Jean-Claude Thomas for\ncomments on a preliminary version of this note and to Antoine Touz\u00e9 who prevented me from\nmaking a mistake in spectral sequences.\n\n2. Simplices and bi-simplices at the manifold level\nIn this section we give a geometrical approach to the intersection product in the homology\nof M. The important point is that it is done in a way so that the intersection product lifts\nimmediatly to LM. This requires an appeal to Thom's transversality with constraints which is\nmore powerful than the usual transversality, as it is usually done (see J.E. McClure [11] in the\nP L case or E. Castillo, R. Diaz [3] in the smooth case).\n2.1. The manifold M under consideration is equipped with an atlas A of charts. A small\nk-simplex is a smooth map\n\u03c3 : \u2206k \u2192 M\nwhose image is contained in a chart from A. For each simplex \u03c3 some particular chart U(\u03c3)\nP\u2208 A\nis chosen once for all containing its image. A small k-chain is a linear combination \u03be =\nni \u03c3i\nwith coefficient ni \u2208 Z of finitely many small simplices \u03c3i . The oriention twisted boundary is\ndefined by the following formula:\n\u2202\u03c3 =\n\nk\nX\n\n\u03b5(\u22121)i Fi \u03c3,\n\ni=0\n\nwhere Fi \u03c3 is the ith face of \u03c3 and \u03b5 is the sign of the Jacobian of change of coordinates from\nU(Fi \u03c3) to U(\u03c3) calculated at any point of the image of Fi \u03c3. The small chains with this boundary\nform a chain complex whose homology is H\u2217 (M; Zor ), the homology with integral coefficients\ntwisted by the orientation.\n\n\f3\n\nIn the sequel, homotopy means smooth homotopy. Given a k-simplex \u03c3, a homotopy \u03c3 t :\n\u2206 \u2192 M, t \u2208 [0, 1], with \u03c3 0 = \u03c3 induces a homotopy (F \u03c3)t of each face F \u03c3. So the following\ndefinition makes sense.\nP\nDefinition 2.2. Given a chain \u03be P\n=\nni \u03c3i , a boundary preserving homotopy of \u03be is a one\nparameter family \u03be t , t \u2208 [0, 1], \u03be t = ni \u03c3it , where t 7\u2192 \u03c3it is a homotopy of \u03c3i into M (\u03c3i0 = \u03c3i ),\nand such that, if \u03c3i and \u03c3j have a common face at time t = 0 the corresponding simplices \u03c3it\nand \u03c3jt still have a common face at any time.\nk\n\nFor instance, if \u03be is a cycle then \u03be t is a cycle for every t \u2208 [0, 1]. When we consider such a\nhomotopy of small chain, we shall limit ourselves to the case when the homotopy is small, that\nis: each summand \u03c3it takes place in U(\u03c3i ). The following homotopy extension lemma is easy to\nprove.\nLemma 2.3. Let \u03c4 be any simplex which is a face of one of the summands of \u03be. Any (small)\nhomotopy of \u03c4 extends as a (small) boundary preserving homotopy of \u03be. The same statement\nholds for a family of homotopies with an extension depending continuously on the parameter.\nDefinition 2.4. A (p, q)-bi-simplex of M \u00d7 M is a pair (u, v) where u is a p-simplex and v is\na q-simplex of M. It is said to be small when both factors are small simplices of M.\nIt is convenient to denote it u\u00d7v like the map u\u00d7v : \u2206p \u00d7\u2206q \u2192 M \u00d7M, (x, y) 7\u2192 (u(x), v(y)).\nThe (small) bi-simplices generate a bi-complex C\u2217\u2217 (M \u00d7 M) whose elements are bi-chains, with\ntwo boundary operators twisted by the orientation,\n\u22021 (u \u00d7 v) = (\u2202u) \u00d7 v, \u22022 (u \u00d7 v) = u \u00d7 \u2202v,\nand a total boundary operator\nD(u \u00d7 v) = \u2202u \u00d7 v + (\u22121)p u \u00d7 \u2202v.\nDefinition 2.5. A (small) bi-simplex u \u00d7 v is said to be transverse when the map u \u00d7 v is\ntransverse to the diagonal \u2206M and when all its faces (they are bi-simplices) are also transverse\nto the diagonal.\nIn the sequel, all transverse bi-simplices will be small, without saying it. The advantage is\nthat W = (u \u00d7 v)\u22121 (\u2206M ) is a proper orientable submanifold of codimension n (with corners)\nin \u2206p \u00d7 \u2206q . Moreover, if we use the charts U(u) and U(v) whose product contains the image\nof u \u00d7 v, W receives a canonical orientation.\nNotice that, when u \u00d7 v is a transverse bi-simplex, a small homotopy of one of the factors\ntr\nkeeps them transverse. The transverse bi-simplices generate a sub-bicomplex C\u2217\u2217\n(M \u00d7 M) of\nC\u2217\u2217 (M \u00d7 M). A bi-chain is said to be transverse when each of its bi-simplices is transverse. It\nis said to be a product bi-chain if it has the form \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 where both factors are chains in M.\nLemma 2.6. Let \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 be a product bi-chain. There exists an arbitrarily C \u221e -small boundary\npreserving homotopy \u03be t of \u03be 0 = \u03be such that \u03be 1 \u00d7 \u03b7 is transverse. Moreover, when \u2202\u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is\ntransverse, the homotopy can be chosen stationary on \u2202\u03be \u00d7 \u03b7. The same statement holds for\nthe second factor.\n\n\f4\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS LAUDENBACH\n\nConsidering the composition of loops we have in mind, it is very important to make this\napproximation among the bi-chains.\nProof. We first consider the case when \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 = u \u00d7 v is a bi-simplex. The conclusion follows\nfrom Thom's transversality theorem, not in its elementary form but in the form known as the\ntransversality with constraint ([12]). Indeed, only the first factor is moved for guaranteeing that\nbi-simplices remain bi-simplices during the deformation. We argue as follows. Let S be a small\nn-ball in the vector space containing the chart U(u), so small that, for any s \u2208 S, us := u + s\nis still contained in U(u). We introduce the family (us \u00d7 v) parametrized by S. It is transverse\nto \u2206M as well as its restriction to any face of \u2206p \u00d7 \u2206q . Therefore, according to Sard's lemma\n(used \u00e0 la Thom), for almost every s \u2208 S, us \u00d7 v is a transverse bi-simplex.\nFor the general case, it is useful to observe that, in the above argument, the space S of\nparameters can be chosen arbitrarily small. When considering a product bi-chain \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7, its\nk-skeleton is the collection of all the k-faces of the bi-simplices appearing in \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7. Arguing\nrecursively, we may assume that all bi-simplices in the k-skeleton are transverse. Let (u \u00d7 v)\nbe a (k + 1)-bi-simplex, which we endow with a family S of translations in U(u). According\nto lemma 2.3, the translation by any s \u2208 S extends as a boundary preserving homotopy of\n\u03be (ending at \u03bes ) and it can be chosen small enough so that each bi-simplex of the k-skeleton\nremains transverse. Therefore, for almost every s \u2208 S, \u03bes is transverse along its k-skeleton and\nu \u00d7 v. Repeating this process, we successively make all (k + 1)-bi-simplices transverse.\nFor the relative version, we notice that, if F u is a face of u and F u \u00d7 v is transverse, then\nu \u00d7 v is automatically transverse to \u2206M on a neighborhood of the domain of F u \u00d7 v. In that\ncase we can moderate the translation by s so that it becomes stationary along F u \u00d7 v. The\ngeneral relative version follows easily.\n\u22c4\nLet [\u03be] and [\u03b7] be two classes of respective degrees p and q in H\u2217 (M; Zor ). According to\nlemma 2.6, they can be represented by small cycles so that the bi-cycle \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is transverse. This\nbi-cycle is unique up to transverse homology; more precisely we claim the following uniqueness\nlemma:\nLemma 2.7. Let \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 and \u03be \u2032 \u00d7 \u03b7 \u2032 be two transverse bi-cycles in the same bi-homology class\n([\u03be] = [\u03be \u2032 ] and [\u03b7] = [\u03b7 \u2032 ]). There exists a transverse bi-chain \u03a9 whose total boundary is D\u03a9 =\n\u03be \u2032 \u00d7 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7.\nProof. There exists a cycle \u03be \u2032\u2032 , homotopic to \u03be, such that \u03be \u2032\u2032 \u00d7 \u03b7 and \u03be \u2032\u2032 \u00d7 \u03b7 \u2032 are both transverse\n(\u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is already transverse and this property is preserved by approximation of \u03be; according to\nlemma 2.6, such an approximation exists making \u03be \u2032\u2032 \u00d7 \u03b7 \u2032 transverse). If \u03c9 is a (p + 1)-chain such\nthat \u2202\u03c9 = \u03be \u2212 \u03be \u2032\u2032 , there is a boundary preserving homotopy \u03c9 t , t \u2208 [0, 1], of \u03c9 relative to its\nboundary so that \u03c9 1 \u00d7 \u03b7 is transverse. By the same argument there is a (p + 1)-chain \u03c9 \u2032 with\n\u2202\u03c9 \u2032 = \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 , such that \u03be \u2032\u2032 \u00d7 \u03c9 \u2032 is transverse. Eventually, there exists \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 with \u2202\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 = \u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u2032\u2032\nsuch that \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 \u00d7 \u03b7 \u2032 is transverse. By concatening the three transverse homologies \u03c9 1 \u00d7 \u03b7, \u03be \u2032\u2032 \u00d7 \u03c9 \u2032\nand \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 \u00d7 \u03b7 \u2032 we get a transverse homology joining both given bi-cycles.\n\u22c4\n2.8. Intersection of cycles.\n\n\f5\n\nWe are now ready for defining the intersection of cycles. To begin with, we consider a\ntransverse product bi-chain \u03be \u00d7\u03b7 of degree (p, q), which reads as a sum of transverse bi-simplices\nX\n\u03be\u00d7\u03b7 =\nnij ui \u00d7 vj .\nLet Wij be the preimage of \u2206M by ui \u00d7 vj . As already noted, Wij is an oriented manifold\nwith corners of codimension n. If F (ui \u00d7 vj ) is a face of the bi-simplex, F Wij denotes the\ncorresponding face of Wij .\nAccording to Whitehead [13], Wij can be smoothly triangulated by a P L-triangulation Tij .\nMoreover if some faces have been already triangulated, by using the relative version of Whitehead's theorem, Tij can be chosen so that the triangulated faces are subcomplexes. If two\nbi-simplices have common faces F (ui \u00d7 vj ) = F (uk \u00d7 vl ), then we have a canonical diffeomorphism F Wij \u2192 F Wkl which we think of as an identification. The triangulations of these faces\nare chosen accordingly. We consider the chain of \u2206M \u223c\n=M\nX\n\u03be * \u03b7 := (\u22121)n(n\u2212q)\nnij (ui \u00d7 vj )|(Wij , Tij )\nwhich is called the intersection product. Of course, as a chain it depends on the chosen triangulations. But, since the latter are unique up to subdividing and boundary preserving isotopy\n(that is, smooth isotopy of each simplex in Wij keeping the triangulation property), the ambiguity is not severe. The sign, which we call the Dold sign, will be commented upon later.\nLemma 2.9. When \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is a transverse bi-cycle, the intersection product \u03be * \u03b7 is a cycle of\ndegree p + q \u2212 n (with orientation twisted coefficients). If \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is changed by a transverse\nhomology (in the sense of lemma 2.7), \u03be * \u03b7 is changed by a homology. Finally, [\u03be] * [\u03b7] is\nwell-defined in Hp+q\u2212n (M; Zor ).\nNote that a change of triangulation of the Wij 's may be thought of as a special case of a\nchange by a transverse homology.\nProof. As Wij is an oriented proper submanifold, (Wij , Tij ) is a relative cycle in \u2206p \u00d7 \u2206q .\nThus, the total boundary of (ui \u00d7 vj )|(Wij , Tij ) is\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(\u2202ui ) \u00d7 vj |(Wij , Tij ) + (\u22121)p ui \u00d7 (\u2202vj ) |(Wij , Tij ).\nBy summing on ij we get the boundary of \u03be * \u03b7. As \u03be and \u03b7 are cycles, each hyperface in the\nlatter sum appears twice with opposite sign. The rest of the statement is easy to prove.\n\u22c4\nRemark 2.10. In his book [7] (Chap. VIII, \u00a713.3), A. Dold explains that the chosen sign\nmakes the intersection product on homology and the (unsigned) cup-product on cohomology\nfit together via the Poincar\u00e9 duality. Another advantage of this sign is the following. Set\nH\u2217 (M; Zor ) = H\u2217+n (M; Zor ). This regraded homology endowed with the above intersection\nproduct becomes a commutative ring in the graded sense.\n\n\f6\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS LAUDENBACH\n\n3. Simplices and bi-simplices at the free loop space level\n3.1. We recall the evaluation map ev0 : LM \u2192 M. A simplex \u03a3 : \u2206k \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 M is said to be\nsmall when \u03c3 = ev0 (\u03a3) is so. The ith -face of \u03a3 is is obtained by restricting \u03a3 to Fi \u2206k \u00d7 S 1 . We\nhave Fi (ev0 (\u03a3)) = ev0 (Fi \u03a3). The oriention twisted boundary of \u03a3 is\n\u2202\u03a3 =\n\nk\nX\n\n\u03b5(\u22121)i Fi \u03a3,\n\ni=0\n\nwhere \u03b5 is the sign of the Jacobian of change of coordinates from U(ev0 (Fi \u03a3)) to U(ev0 (\u03a3)). The\nsmall chains with this boundary form a sub-complex of C\u2217 (LM), the singular chain complex of\nLM, whose homology is H\u2217 (LM; Zor ). Indeed, this sub-complex is obtained from C\u2217 (LM) by\ntwo operations which induce homotopy equivalences: subdivision and smoothing. The notion\nof boundary preserving homotopy is similar to the one given in 2.1.\nLemma 3.2. The evaluation map has the lifting property for boundary preserving homotopy\nof chains with any initial chain. Moreover, if the lifting of the homotopy is given along some\nfaces this partial lifting can be extended to a global lifting.\nProof. It is clear for \u2206k \u00d7S 1 \u00d7[0, 1] retracts onto \u2206k \u00d7S 1 \u00d7{0}\u222a\u2206k \u00d7{0}\u00d7[0, 1]\u222aF \u00d7S 1 \u00d7[0, 1],\nwhere F is any union of faces in \u2206k .\n\u22c4\nA (p, q)-bi-simplex u \u00d7 v in LM \u00d7 LM is a map\n\u2206p \u00d7 \u2206q \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 M \u00d7 M,\n\u0001\n(x, y, \u03b8) 7\u2192 u(x, \u03b8), v(y, \u03b8) .\n\u0001\nIt is said to be transverse when ev0 (u), ev0 (v) is a transverse bi-simplex of M \u00d7 M. In that\ncase, the preimage of the diagonal \u2206M yields a submanifold with corners W \u2282 \u2206p \u00d7 \u2206q . For\neach (x, y) \u2208 W , the loops u(x, \u2212) and v(y, \u2212) are composable, as they have common base\npoints u(x, 0) = v(y, 0). Therefore, taking a triangulation of W and the Dold sign as in 2.8, we\nget a (p + q \u2212 n)-chain of composable loops, which we call the loop intersection product:\nu \u2217 v := (\u22121)n(n\u2212q) (u \u00d7 v)|W \u00d7 S 1 .\nPerforming the composition (in some order, u before v) yields a (p + q \u2212 n)-chain in LM, called\nthe Chas-Sullivan product or loop product u * v. Of course, it depends on the choice of the\nCS\ntriangulation of W . Here, we see that the product structure of u\u00d7v is very important; without it\nwe lose the entries of the composition. Thus, when making a bi-simplex transverse, it is crucial\nto do it by homotopy through bi-simplices. That is the reason why we used transversality with\nconstraints.\nThis loop product extends linearly to the transverse bi-chains. When performing it on a\nproduct bi-cycle, the result is a cycle in LM whose homology class in Hp+q\u2212n (LM; Zor ) is welldefined. Strictly speaking the system of coefficients is ev0\u2217 (Zor ), which we write Zor for short\nand we shall do the same each time a loop space is in question. More precisely, we have the\nfollowing proposition.\n\n\f7\n\nProposition 3.3. Let [\u03be] \u2208 Hp (LM; Zor ) and [\u03b7] \u2208 Hq (LM; Zor ). These classes can be represented by cycles in LM such that \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is a transverse bi-cycle. The class of \u03be * \u03b7 is uniquely\nCS\n\ndefined in Hp+q\u2212n (LM; Zor ).\nProof. Starting with arbitrary representatives of the given homology classes in LM, lemma\n2.6 is applied: it produces an homotopy of their images by the evaluation map making them a\ntransverse bi-cycle in M \u00d7 M. The lifting homotopy property (lemma 3.2) allows one to make\n\u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 a transverse bi-cycle in LM \u00d7 LM. For this representative, the loop product \u03be * \u03b7 is\nCS\n\nwell defined. If another representative \u03be \u2032 \u00d7 \u03b7 \u2032 is used, one can prove that \u03be \u2032 \u00d7 \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 are\njoined by a transverse homology, that is a transverse bi-chain in LM \u00d7 LM. It is nothing but\na loop version of the uniqueness lemma 2.7 and it can be deduced from the latter by applying\nthe lifting homotopy property. As a consequence the homology class of \u03be * \u03b7 is well defined. \u22c4\nCS\n\nRemark 3.4. Of course the composition of smooth loops produces a piecewise smooth loop\nonly. There are two ways for correcting this default. One consists of doing a smoothing (boundary preserving) homotopy. The other consists of using LM = C 0 (S 1 , M) equipped with a mixed\nsimplicial structure: a k-simplex will be a continuous map u : \u2206k \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 M whose restriction\nto \u2206k \u00d7 0 is smooth.\nIn the sequel we use the following simplified notation: \u03be * \u03b7 := \u03be * \u03b7, which is defined when\nCS\n\nthe bi-cycle \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is transverse, and [\u03be] * [\u03b7] := [\u03be * \u03b7] which is well defined. Actually, there is\nCS\n\na 1-parameter family of compositions \u2212 *s \u2212, s \u2208 [0, 1], defined as follows. Two loops u and v\nare said to be s-composable when u(s) = v(0); in that case the composed loop u *s v is made of\nu|[0, 1 \u2212 s] \u2217 v \u2217 u|[1 \u2212 s, 1]. When s = 0, it is the usual composition and when s = 1 we have\nu *1 v = v * u (notice that if two loops are 0-composable, they are also 1-composable).\nProposition 3.5. At the homology level, the loop product is commutative up to sign. Precisely,\nif \u03be and \u03b7 are respectively a p-cycle and a q-cycle of LM, then [\u03be] * [\u03b7] = (\u22121)(p\u2212n)(q\u2212n) [\u03b7] * [\u03be].\nThe loop product is also associative.\nIf the regrading H\u2217 = H\u2217+n is applied, then H\u2217 (LM, Zor ) when endowed with the loop product becomes a graded commutative and associative ring.\nProof. We assume that the bi-cycle \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 in LM \u00d7 LM is transverse. We first prove:\n[\u03be] * [\u03b7] = [\u03be *1 \u03b7].\nWriting \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 = nij ui \u00d7 vj , one can make a boundary preserving homotopy of \u03be so that, for\nevery ij, the following map\nP\n\n(x, y, s) \u2208 \u2206p \u00d7 \u2206q \u00d7 [0, 1] 7\u2192 (ui (x, s), vj (y, 0), s) \u2208 M \u00d7 M \u00d7 [0, 1]\nis transverse to \u2206M \u00d7 [0, 1]. This transversality yields us a (p + q \u2212 n + 1)-chain \u03c9 in LM whose\nboundary is \u2202\u03c9 = \u03be *1 \u03b7 \u2212 \u03be * \u03b7. Note that the loops in \u03c9 have u(x, 0) as base points; therefore,\neven if the loops in u are orientation reversing no sign appears in the formula of \u2202\u03c9.\nNow, we are reduced to proving:\n[\u03be *1 \u03b7] = (\u22121)(p\u2212n)(q\u2212n) [\u03b7] * [\u03be].\n\n\f8\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS LAUDENBACH\n\nOn both sides of this equality the composition is the same. The only difference comes from\nthe orientation of the manifold Wij associated to each transverse bi-simplex ui \u00d7 vj appearing\nin \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7. The permutation of both factors in this bi-simplex induces a change (\u22121)n in the\nco-orientation of the diagonal \u2206M and a change (\u22121)pq due to the order of the factors \u2206p and\n\u2206q in the source. Moreover, the Dold sign (\u22121)n(n\u2212q) is changed to (\u22121)n(n\u2212p) . Altogether, the\nsign rule follows.\nFor associativity, if three chains \u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6 (of respective degrees p, q, r) are given in LM, \u03be \u00d7\u03b7 \u00d7\u03b6\nis easily defined to be transverse. If they are cycles and if the triple is transverse, the triple\ncomposition [\u03be] * [\u03b7] * [\u03b6] is well defined in Hp+q+r\u22122n (LM; Zor ). Moreover, in that situation the\nfollowing facts are easily checked:\n- \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is transverse;\n- (\u03be \u2217 \u03b7) \u00d7 \u03b6 is transverse (where \u2217 stands for the loop intersection product);\n- (\u03be * \u03b7) * \u03b6 coincides with \u03be * \u03b7 * \u03b6 up to a canonical reparametrization of the circle.\nThe last item yields the associativity in homology once it is observed that the same is true for\nother bracketing.\nNow the only question is how to make \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03b6 transverse when the is not. It is not sufficient\nto move one factor, as one factor in M \u00d7 M \u00d7 M is not transverse to the small diagonal. It\nis necesary to move two factors, say \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7, but keeping the product structure, that is moving\nthrough product chains \u03be t \u00d7 \u03b7 t ; it is again transversality with constraint.\n\u22c4\n \u0304\nRemark 3.6. Each free loop \u03b3, \u03b8 7\u2192 \u03b3(\u03b8), gives rise to a 1-cycle \u2206(\u03b3)\nof loops by rotating the\nsource:\n \u0304\n\u2206(\u03b3)(t)(\u03b8)\n= \u03b3(t + \u03b8), t \u2208 S 1 .\nThis map induces \u2206 : H\u2217 (LM) \u2192 H\u2217+1 (LM), with twisted coefficients when M is not orientable. Arguing in a similar way as in the previous proposition 3.5, one could prove the\ntheorem of Chas-Sullivan that H\u2217 (LM), endowed with the loop product and \u2206, is a BatalinVilkovsky algebra.\n4. A multiplicative spectral sequence\nIn this section, using our definition of the loop product, we discuss multiplicative properties\nwhich have been stated and proved by Mark Goresky and Nancy Hingston in [9], \u00a712 (up to the\ncoefficient system). The setting is the one that R. Bott first considered in his seminal paper [1],\nwhere he studied the standard n-sphere, and in the next paper [2]. We summarize his results as\nfollows. Let M be an n-dimensional closed Riemannian manifold whose primitive geodesics are\nall simple loops with the same length (= 1, say). Denote by \u039b the space of loops parametrized\nproportionally to arc length. The class of regularity is not very important here. For instance\ntake piecewise smooth loops; a good class is the Sobolev class H 1 (S 1 , M). Let l2 : \u039b \u2192 R be\nthe squared length. Bott proved that it is a nondegenerate function (now called a Morse-Bott\nfunction) and he calculated the index of the critical points (that is, the closed geodesics). For\np \u2208 N, let \u039bp be the subspace of loops of length \u2264 p and \u03a3p be the space of geodesics of length\np. A geodesic in \u03a3p is just a primitive geodesic which is traversed p times. As a manifold\n\u03a30 \u223c\n= UM where UM stands for the unit tangent space to M. Let\n= M and, for p \u2265 1, \u03a3p \u223c\n\n\f9\n\n\u03b1p be the index of the Hessian of l2 at any point of \u03a3p ; obviously \u03b10 = 0. Bott proved the\niteration formula:\n\u03b1p = p\u03b11 + (p \u2212 1)(n \u2212 1).\nMoreover he calculated (with Z2 coefficients) the spectral sequence derived from the filtration\n\u039b0 \u2282 \u039b1 \u2282 . . . of \u039b. We are going to consider the same spectral sequence, up to some regrading.\nr\nDefinition 4.1. A spectral sequence {Ep,q\n, dr }r\u22651 is said to be multiplicative when it is endowed\nr\nr\nr\nwith a product Ep,q \u2297 Ep\u2032 ,q\u2032 \u2192 Ep+p\u2032 ,q+q\u2032 such that:\n1) dr is a derivation in the graded sense:\n\ndr (x * y) = dr (x) * y + (\u22121)|x| x * dr (y),\nr\nwhere |.| stands for the total degree |x| = p + q when x \u2208 Ep,q\n;\nr+1 \u223c\nr\nr\nr\n2) the product on E\u2217,\u2217 = H\u2217 (E\u2217,\u2217 , d ) is induced by the one of E\u2217,\u2217\non the ideal ker dr .\n\nFollowing Chataur-Le Borgne in [5], we set\n1\nE1p,q = Ep,q+n\n= Hp+q+n (\u039bp , \u039bp\u22121; ev0\u2217 (Zor )).\n\nThe differential d1 is the connecting homomorphism in the long exact sequence of the triple\nr\nr\n(\u039bp , \u039bp\u22121 , \u039bp\u22122). More generally, dr : E\u2217,\u2217\n\u2192 E\u2217,\u2217\nis defined by the usual algorithm associated\nto the filtration * * * \u039bp\u22121 \u2282 \u039bp \u2282 \u039bp+1 \u2282 * * * \u039b (see [10], Chap. 2). Notice that page 0 exists in\nthis spectral sequence, but there is no multiplicative structure on it.\nProposition 4.2. The loop product endows {Er\u2217,\u2217 }r\u22651 with a multiplicative structure.\nProof. Here the system of coefficients ev0\u2217 (Zor ) is understood. We first look at the desired\nproperties on page r = 1. When \u03be is a relative i-cycle of the pair (\u039bp , \u039bp\u22121 ), \u03b7 is a relative\nj-cycle of the pair (\u039bp\u2032 , \u039bp\u2032\u22121 ) and \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is transverse, the loop intersection product \u03be \u2217 \u03b7 is\na (i + j \u2212 n)-chain of composable loops. By performing the composition we get a chain c of\nloops of length \u2264 p + p\u2032 since the length of the composed loop is just the sum of the lengths\nof the entries. The boundary of c is a cycle in \u039bp+p\u2032\u22121 . The class of [\u03be] * [\u03b7] is well defined in\nHi+j\u2212n (\u039bp+p\u2032 , \u039bp+p\u2032\u22121 ). After regrading, this product behaves well with respect to the bi-degree.\nIt remains to check that d1 is a derivation.\nWe look first at a transverse bi-simplex u \u00d7 v of bi-degree (i, j) in \u039b \u00d7 \u039b. Let W \u2282 \u2206i \u00d7 \u2206j\nbe the preimage of the diagonal \u2206M by ev0 (u) \u00d7 ev0 (v). Its boundary is made of two parts:\n- \u22021 W := W \u2229 (\u2202\u2206i \u00d7 \u2206j )\n- \u22022 W := W \u2229 (\u2206i \u00d7 \u2202\u2206j )\nEach part gives rise to an (i + j + n \u2212 1)-chain in \u039b which is a part of \u2202(u * v). As in the proof\nof lemma 2.9 the second chain is endowed with the sign (\u22121)i according to the formula for the\ntotal boundary which is written after definition 2.4. Taking the Dold sign into account yields:\n\u2202(u * v) = (\u2202u) * v + (\u22121)n\u2212i u * (\u2202v).\nBy summing such a formula over all bi-chains forming \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7, we get:\n\u2202(\u03be * \u03b7) = (\u2202\u03be) * \u03b7 + (\u22121)n\u2212i \u03be * (\u2202\u03b7).\n\n\f10\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS LAUDENBACH\n\nAfter regrading, it becomes a derivation formula. When \u03be and \u03b7 are relative cycles as above,\nd1 ([\u03be] * [\u03b7]) = (d1 [\u03be]) * [\u03b7] + (\u22121)|\u03be|[\u03be] * d1[\u03b7]; hence, property 1 from definition 4.1 holds for r = 1.\nThe product on E2\u2217,\u2217 is defined by taking \u03be, a relative cycle of the pair (\u039bp , \u039bp\u22122), and \u03b7, a\nrelative cycle in the pair (\u039bp\u2032 , \u039bp\u2032\u22122 ), where \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is transverse. Thus the chain of composed\nloops is a relative cycle of the pair (\u039bp+p\u2032 , \u039bp+p\u2032\u22122 ). It can be checked that elements in ker d1\nare represesentable by such cycles. Hence property 2 from definition 4.1 holds for r = 1.\nr\nThe same argument applies for every r \u2265 1 once one remembers the definition of Ep,\u2217\nassor\nciated to the filtration of \u039b. The product on E\u2217,\u2217 is defined by taking \u03be, a relative cycle of the\npair (\u039bp , \u039bp\u2212r ), and \u03b7, a relative cycle of the pair (\u039bp\u2032 , \u03bbp\u2032\u2212r ), where \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is transverse. The\nboundary operator dr is induced by \u2202 and is not affected by the value of r. After regrading\nr+1\ndr , like d1 , is a derivation and the product which is induced on its homology is the one of E\u2217,\u2217\n. \u22c4\n\n4.3. The Thom isomorphism.\nThere is a Morse-Bott version of the famous Morse lemma. It yields a \"normal\" form for\na Morse-Bott function near a critical manifold. We are going to apply it to the function\nl2 : \u039b \u2192 R near the critical manifold \u03a3p whose index is \u03b1p . If one feels uncomfortable by\napplying this lemma in infinite dimension, one can take a finite dimensional approximation of\n\u039b near \u03a3p by considering the space of geodesics polygons (still parametrized proportionally\nto arc length) with Np edges of equal length, where 1/N is less than the injectivity radius.\nLet Ep\u2212 be the vector bundle of rank \u03b1p over \u03a3p generated by the eigenvectors of the Hessian\nof l2 (with respect to some Riemannian metric on \u039b) whose eigenvalues are negative; it is a\n\u2212\nsub-bundle of T \u039b|\u03a3p . With notation borrowed from [9], let \u03a3\u2212\np = exp(Ep ) denote the unstable\nmanifold of \u03a3p with respect to the gradient of l2 ; we are mainly interested in its germ along\nthe critical manifold. Finally \u039b\u2212\np denotes the open set of loops whose length is less than p. We\n\u2212\nhave \u03a3\u2212\nr\n\u03a3\n\u2282\n\u039b\n(as\na\nconsequence\nof Taylor expansion).\np\np\np\nThe Morse-Bott lemma states:\n(1) \u039b\u2212\np retracts by deformation onto \u039bp\u22121 ;\n(2) \u039bp retracts by deformation onto \u039bp\u22121 \u222a \u03a3\u2212\np.\nAs a consequence, the inclusions of pairs induce the following isomorphisms:\nH\u2217 (\u039bp , \u039bp\u22121 ) \u223c\n= H\u2217 (\u03a3\u2212 , \u03a3\u2212 r \u03a3p ).\n= H\u2217 (\u039bp , \u039b\u2212 ) \u223c\np\n\np\n\np\n\nHere the system of coefficients is\nThe orientation of the fibre bundle Ep\u2212 being twisted\nas ev0\u2217 (Z) is (see [9] Prop. 12.2), we are ready to apply the Thom isomorphism:\nhp : H\u2217 (\u03a3p ; Z) \u223c\n= H\u2217+\u03b1 (\u03a3\u2212 , \u03a3\u2212 r \u03a3p ; ev \u2217 (Zor )),\nev0\u2217 (Zor ).\n\np\n\np\n\np\n\n0\n\nwhich can also be read, when p > 0,\nhp : H\u2217 (UM; Z) \u223c\n= H\u2217+\u03b1p (\u039bp , \u039bp\u22121 ; ev0\u2217 (Zor )).\nNotice also that the Gysin morphism\nH\u2217 (M; Zor ) \u2192 H\u2217+n\u22121 (UM; Z)\n\n\f11\n\nmakes H\u2217 (UM; Z) a H\u2217 (M; Zor )-module for the intersection product. In the next proposition\nthe coefficients are not written; they are meant as we just specified them.\nProposition 4.4. (Goresky-Hingston, [9] Theorem 12.5). The Thom isomorphisms carry the\nintersection product of H\u2217 (UM) into the loop product of \u2295p>0 H\u2217+\u03b1p (\u039bp , \u039bp\u22121). Moreover, they\ncarry the H\u2217 (M)-module structure of H\u2217 (UM) to the H\u2217 (\u039b0 )-module structure of H\u2217 (\u039bp , \u039bp\u22121).\nThe proof below mainly follows the same line as [9]. But it is based on the notion of loop\nproduct that we have introduced in the previous section.\nProof. There are several steps.\nA) One can factorize the intersection product int of H\u2217 (UM) in the following way:\nint0\n\nHi (UM) \u2297 Hj (UM)\n\n/\n\nHi+j\u2212n (UM \u00d7 UM)\nM\n\nint1\n\nint\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\nHi+j\u2212(2n\u22121) (UM)\n\n=\n\n/\n\nHi+j\u2212(2n\u22121) (UM \u00d7 UM)\nUM\n\nIndeed, starting with a transverse bi-cycle \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 we may first intersect it with the fibered product UM \u00d7 UM \u2282 UM \u00d7 UM yielding an (i + j \u2212 n)-cycle \u03b6 (this induces the morphism int0 ),\nM\n\nwhich, in turn, is transverse to the diagonal \u2206U M = UM \u00d7 UM (this induces the morphism\nUM\n\nint1 ).\n\nB) Since ev0 |\u03a3p is a smooth submersion, the fibered product \u03a3p,p\u2032 := \u03a3p \u00d7 \u03a3p\u2032 is a smooth\nM\n\nmanifold. A point of it is a pair of closed geodesics of respective lengths p and p\u2032 which are\ncomposable as loops. In general the composed loop is not a geodesic.\n\u2212\n\u2212\nSimilarly, since \u03a3\u2212\np is tangent to Ep , a fibre bundle over \u03a3p , then ev0 |\u03a3p is also a submersion\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nonto M near \u03a3p . Thus \u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 := \u03a3p \u00d7 \u03a3p\u2032 is smooth near \u03a3p,p\u2032 . The tangent space to \u03a3p,p\u2032 along\nM\n\n\u03a3p,p\u2032 is the restriction of Ep\u2212 \u00d7 Ep\u2212\u2032 , a vector bundle of rank \u03b1p + \u03b1p\u2032 . So we have a Thom\nisomorphism:\n\u2212\nhp,p\u2032 : H\u2217 (\u03a3p,p\u2032 ) \u223c\n= H\u2217+\u03b1p +\u03b1p\u2032 (\u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 , \u03a3p,p\u2032 r \u03a3p,p\u2032 ).\nAt the chain level of small simplices, the Thom isomorphism is generated by the following Thom\n\"extension\": take a small simplex in the base of a disk bundle (which hence is trivial over the\nconsidered small simplex) and cross it with the fiber. If \u03be \u00d7 \u03b7 is a bi-cycle in \u03a3p \u00d7 \u03a3p\u2032 transverse\n\u2212\nto \u03a3p,p\u2032 , then the Thom extension \u03be \u0303\u00d7 \u03b7\u0303 is transverse to \u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 and its intersection with \u03a3p,p\u2032 is the\nThom extension of the intersection cycle in the base \u03a3p,p\u2032 . This proves that the Thom isomorphism carries the loop intersection product Hi (\u03a3p )\u2297Hj (\u03a3p\u2032 ) \u2192 Hi+j\u2212n(\u03a3p,p\u2032 ) to the suitable rel\u2212\n\u2212\native version of the loop intersection product Hi+\u03b1p (\u03a3\u2212\np ) \u2297 Hj+\u03b1p\u2032 (\u03a3p\u2032 ) \u2192 Hi+j+\u03b1p +\u03b1p\u2032 \u2212n (\u03a3p,p\u2032 ).\nNote that, after identification, the first morphism is nothing but int0 from A).\nC) We observe that \u03a3p+p\u2032 lifts (by a section of the composition map) as a submanifold of\ncodimension n \u2212 1 in \u03a3p,p\u2032 . Indeed, any smooth geodesic of length p + p\u2032 splits uniquely into\ntwo geodesics of respective lengths p and p\u2032 . Conversely, (\u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 ) \u2208 \u03a3p,p\u2032 belongs to this lifting\n\n\f12\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS LAUDENBACH\n\nof \u03a3p+p\u2032 if and only if the initial velocities \u03b3\u0307(0) and \u03b3\u0307 \u2032 (0) are positively proportional, which is\na condition of codimension n \u2212 1. Thus, the composition is a map of pairs:\n\u2212\ncomp : (\u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 , \u03a3p,p\u2032 r \u03a3p+p\u2032 ) \u2192 (\u039bp+p\u2032 , \u039bp+p\u2032 r \u03a3p+p\u2032 ).\n\u2212\n\u2212\nThe normal bundle to \u03a3p+p\u2032 in \u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 , denoted by \u03bd, is the direct sum Ep \u2295 Ep\u2032 \u2295 \u03bdp,p\u2032 where\n\u03bdp,p\u2032 denotes the normal bundle to \u03a3p+p\u2032 in \u03a3p,p\u2032 . The rank of \u03bd is \u03b1p + \u03b1p\u2032 + n \u2212 1. According\n\u2212\nto Bott's iteration formula, it equals \u03b1p+p\u2032 , which is the rank of Ep+p\n\u2032.\n\u2212\n\u2212\nIf \u03be is a relative cycle in (\u03a3p,p\u2032 , \u03a3p,p\u2032 r \u03a3p,p\u2032 ) transverse to \u03a3p+p\u2032 , its trace in the pair\n\u2212\n(\u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 , \u03a3p,p\u2032 r \u03a3p+p\u2032 ) is the Thom extension of its intersection with \u03a3p+p\u2032 . In other words we\nhave the following commutative diagram:\n\nHk (\u03a3p,p\u2032 )\n\nint1\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\n\u2212\nHk+\u03b1p +\u03b1p\u2032 (\u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 , \u03a3p,p\u2032 r \u03a3p,p\u2032 )\n\nHk\u2212n+1(\u03a3p+p\u2032 )\n\n/\n\n\u2212\nHk\u2212n+1+\u03b1p+p\u2032 (\u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 , \u03a3p,p\u2032 r \u03a3p+p\u2032 ),\n\nwhere the vertical arrows are the respective Thom isomorphisms. The proof of proposition 4.4\nis not yet achieved because we are still at the level of composable loops and the composition\nhas not yet been performed.\nD) Some difficulty comes here from the fact that the composition map comp : \u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 \u2192 \u039bp+p\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncould be singular along \u03a3p+p in the direction of \u03bdp,p since comp maps \u03a3p,p into the critical\nlevel set of l whose value is p + p\u2032 . We are going to construct:\na) a linear embedding \u03c6 : \u03bd \u2192 T \u039b|\u03a3p+p\u2032 , over the identity of \u03a3p+p\u2032 , such that Hess(l2 ) \u25e6 \u03c6\nis negative definite;\nb) a homotopy from comp to exp \u25e6 \u03c6 \u25e6 exp\u22121 among the maps of pairs\n\u2212\n(\u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 , \u03a3p,p\u2032 r \u03a3p+p\u2032 ) \u2192 (\u039bp+p\u2032 , \u039bp+p\u2032 r \u03a3p+p\u2032 ).\n\u2212\nIf such items exist, comp\u2217 : H\u2217 (\u03a3\u2212\np,p\u2032 , \u03a3p,p\u2032 r \u03a3p+p\u2032 ) \u2192 H\u2217 (\u039bp+p\u2032 , \u039bp+p\u2032 r \u03a3p+p\u2032 ) commutes with\nthe respective Thom isomorphisms, as it is true for \u03c6\u2217 , and the proof of proposition 4.4 is\nfinished.\n\u0001\nWe choose \u03c6 to be the identity of the factor Ep\u2212 \u2295 Ep\u2212\u2032 . This makes sense as Ep\u2212 \u03b3 (resp.\n\u0001\nEp\u2032\u2212 \u03b3 \u2032 ) embeds canonically into (T \u039bp+p\u2032 )\u03b3\u2217\u03b3 \u2032 , thought of as the set of vector fields tangent to\nM along \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2032 : it is a set of tangent vector fields which are vanishing along \u03b3 \u2032 (resp. along \u03b3);\nnotice that a vector in (Ep )\u03b3 corresponds to a vector field along \u03b3 which vanishes at \u03b3(0) since\nUM is homogeneous.\nLet (\u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 ) \u2208 \u03a3p+p\u2032 \u2282 \u03a3p,p\u2032 and X be a vector in \u03bd(\u03b3,\u03b3 \u2032 ) . This vector indicates an infinitesimal\ndeformation of (\u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 ) among the pairs of composable closed smooth geodesics, deformation\nwhich separates the directions of their initial velocities. Precisely, there is a one-parameter\n\u2032\n\u2032\nfamily (\u03b3u , \u03b3u\u2032 ), u \u2208 [0,\n\u0001 \u03b5), of pairs of closed geodesics such that \u03b3u (0) = \u03b3(0) = \u03b3 (0) = \u03b3u (0)\nd\n\u2032\nand du \u03b3\u0307u (0) \u2212 \u03b3\u0307u (0) |u=0 = X (up to a positive scalar); here we identify \u03bd(\u03b3,\u03b3 \u2032 ) with the fibre\nUM\u03b3(0) . Instead of taking this deformation which leaves the length unchanged, we consider\nthe following shortening deformation made of geodesic triangles Tu : the first edge in Tu is\n\u03b3u (t), t \u2208 [0, 1 \u2212 \u03b5], the second edge joins geodesically the point \u03b3u (1 \u2212 \u03b5) to the nearby point\n\n\f13\n\n\u03b3u\u2032 (\u03b5) and the third edge is \u03b3u\u2032 (t), t \u2208 [\u03b5, 1] (the triangle is parametrized proportionally to arc\nlength). We define \u03c6(X) to be the \u0001infinitesimal generator of this family. By estimating l(Tu )\nit is easily seen that Hess(l2 ) \u03c6(X) < 0. Moreover \u03c6(X) is independent of Ep\u2212 \u2295 Ep\u2212\u2032 since, as\na tangent vector field to M along the composed loop \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2032 , it does not vanish at the junction\npoint \u03b3(1) = \u03b3 \u2032 (0). This proves item a). In order to obtain item b) it is sufficient to make \u01eb\ntend to 0.\n\u22c4\nBy taking the different regradings into account, the Thom isomorphism yields when p > 0:\nE1 \u223c\n= Hp+q+n\u2212\u03b1 \u2212(2n\u22121) (UM, Z),\n= Hp+q+n\u2212\u03b1 (UM, Z) \u223c\n= Hp+q+n\u2212\u03b1 (\u03a3p , Z) \u223c\np,q\n\np\n\np\n\np\n\nwhere H\u2217 (UM; Z) denotes the regraded intersection ring of the (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional manifold\nUM. Similarly, after regrading the Gysin morphism, H\u2217 (M; Zor ) \u2192 H\u2217+n\u22121 (UM; Z), becomes\na morphism of degree 0, H\u2217 (M; Zor ) \u2192 H\u2217 (UM; Z), making H\u2217 (UM; Z) a H\u2217 (M; Zor )-module\nfor the intersection product.\nThe multiplicative structure on E1\u2217,\u2217 can be interpreted in terms of H\u2217 (UM). The following\nstatement is due to Chataur-Le Borgne in [5] (up to the coefficient system).\nProposition 4.5.\n1) There is an isomorphism of bigraded rings:\nE1 \u223c\n= H\u2217 (M; Zor ) \u2295 H\u2217 (UM; Z)[T ]\u22651 .\n\u2217,\u2217\n\nHere E1\u2217,\u2217 is endowed with the bigraded ring structure yielded by proposition 4.2. The intersection\nrings H\u2217 (M) and H\u2217 (UM) have bi-degree (0, \u2217). The new variable T has bi-degree (1, \u03b11 +n\u22122)\nand appears only at a positive power. Regarding H\u2217 (UM) as a H\u2217 (M)-module, the right hand\nside has a well-defined ring structure.\n2) The differential d1 on page 1 vanishes at every place.\n3) The page \u221e inherits the same isomorphism of bigraded rings as page 1:\nE\u221e \u223c\n= H\u2217 (M; Zor ) \u2295 H\u2217 (UM; Z)[T ]\u22651 .\n\u2217,\u2217\n\nProof. 1) We read the first page of the spectral sequence, E1\u2217,\u2217 , via the Thom isomorphism\ntaking proposition 4.4 into account. For instance, we have (without writing the coefficients):\n= E1\nH0 (UM) = H2n\u22121 (UM) = H2n\u22121+\u03b1 (UM) \u223c\n= E1\n1\n\n1,2n\u22122+\u03b11\n\n1,n\u22122+\u03b11\n\nand T is nothing but the image of the unit \u03bc \u2208 H0 (UM) (that is, the fundamental class of\nUM) through the Thom isomorphism. Once the desired ring isomorphism is specified on T it\nextends globally using the multiplicative property of the Thom isomorphism.\n2) As H\u2217 (\u039b0 ) is a direct factor in H\u2217 (\u039b), d1 : E11,\u2217 \u2192 E10,\u2217 has to vanish. In particular, d1 (T ) = 0.\nAs d1 is a derivation (prop. 4.2), it vanishes everywhere.\n3) As a consequence, page 2 of the spectral sequence is isomorphic to page 1 as a bi-graded\nring. Therefore the differential d2 vanishes for the same reason as d1 . Proceeding recursively\nthrough the successive pages yields the conclusion.\n\u22c4\n\n\f14\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS LAUDENBACH\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
