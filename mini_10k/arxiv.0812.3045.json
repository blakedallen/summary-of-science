New features of the normal state such as particle-hole asymmetry, maxima\nin the energy dispersion and accompanying drops in the spectral weight of quasiparticles agree\nwith the ansatz of Yang et al. for the single particle propagator in the pseudogap phase. The\ncoherent quasiparticle dispersion and reduced asymmetry in the tunneling density of states in the\nsuperconducting state can also be described by this propagator.\n\nThe anomalous electronic properties of the pseudogap\nphase in underdoped cuprates continue to challenge theory. Angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements of the Fermi surface in the pseudogap state show\nonly disconnected Fermi arcs centered on the nodal directions. [3\u20135] A recent high resolution ARPES study on\nunderdoped BSCCO by Yang and collaborators [1] examined the spectra below and above the chemical potential \u03bc\nby carefully dividing out the Fermi function. They found\nthat the spectra displayed particle-hole asymmetry away\nfrom the nodal direction in the pseudogap state but not\nin optimal doped samples, so that the asymmetry is a\nproperty of the pseudogap phase. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) by Kohsaka and collaborators [2] has determined the coherent quasiparticle dispersion in a wide\nrange of hole densities in the superconducting state, by\nan ingenious analysis of the voltage dependent spatial interference patterns. [6] The asymmetry in the tunneling\ndensity of states measured by STM is weaker due to the\ninherent particle-hole symmetry of superconductivity. Recent angle integrated photoemission (AIPES) experiments\non underdoped samples [7]found the density of states varied linearly with energy in contrast to the constant value\nthat appears at a band edge in two dimensions. In this letter we analyze ARPES, STM and AIPES results using an\nansatz for the single particle propagator proposed earlier\n\nby three of us. Key properties of the quasiparticles (QP) in\nthis propagator, such as maxima in the energy dispersion\nin the normal pseudogap state, the connection between\nthe QP dispersion in the superconducting state and the\nhole density, are directly confirmed by these experiments.\nAn alternative explanation of particle-hole asymmetry in\nARPES experiments has been proposed by Anderson [8].\nAs the hole density, x, crosses the underdoped pseudogap region of the phase diagram, the cuprates crossover\nfrom a full Fermi surface metal at overdoping to a Mott insulator at stoichiometry. A Mott insulating state is driven\nby strong onsite Coulomb repulsion and not per se by\ntranslational symmetry breaking. The stoichiometric underdoped cuprate YBa2 Cu4 O8 , shows no sign of a charge\nor spin density modulation on either Cu or O sites. [9] It\nis therefore desirable to examine theories where the truncated Fermi surface appears as a precursor to the Mott\nstate without translational symmetry breaking. An example is the 2D array of 2-leg Hubbard ladders studied\nby Konik, Rice and Tsvelik (KRT). [10] They showed that\nlines of zeros in the propagator GR (k, \u03c9 = 0, x) associated\nwith the charge gap at half-filling, enclosing a commensurate area of 1 el/site, do not move with light doping. The\nLuttinger Sum Rule on the area enclosed by the condition\nRe[GR (k, \u03c9 = 0, x)] > 0 is fulfilled with the Fermi surface\ntruncated to small hole pockets.\n\np-1\n\n\fQuasiparticle energy Ek (eV)\n\nKai-Yu Yang1,3, H.-B.

The\nGutzwiller factors g t (x) = 2x/ (1 + x) and g s (x) =\n4/(1 + x)2 account for the no-double occupation projection on the kinetic and superexchange terms in the t-J\nmodel.

Parameters are quoted in Table 1.\nAs discussed by YRZ the Fermi surface in the pseudogap\nregime with divergent GR (k, \u03c9 = 0, x) has 4 pockets centered on the nodal directions enclosing a total area related\nto the hole density. [12] ARPES experiments [1, 3\u20135] show\narcs rather than closed pockets, but as YRZ pointed out\nthe QP weight in GR varies rapidly with very small values\non the back sides of the pockets, which can account for the\nfailure to observe these parts of the pockets. Many experimental features, e.g. the slow variation of the nodal Fermi\nvelocity vF and Drude weight scaling with hole density, are\nreproduced by the YRZ propagator.

Honerkamp and coworkers [11]\nargued for such behavior from the similarities in the flow of\nthe response functions in functional renormalization group\nanalyses of Hubbard models near half-filling. Yang, Rice\nand Zhang [12] (YRZ) proposed an adaptation of the KRT\napproach to the lightly doped t-J model. They introduced\na self-energy, \u03a3R (k, \u03c9, x), which diverges at \u03c9 = 0 on a\nsurface spanned by elastic particle-particle umklapp scattering analogous to the behavior of the ladder model. In\nthe 2D square lattice this umklapp surface is a diamond\nconnecting antinodal points on the Brillouin zone boundary. Note this umklapp surface appears as the energy gap\nsurface also in the case of wider Hubbard ladders with\nmore than 2 legs. [13]\nYRZ took over the form for the gap function \u2206R (k, x)\nfrom the renormalized mean field theory of Zhang et al.\n[14] for the resonant valence bond (RVB) state [15, 16] of\nthe strong coupling 2D t-J model and proposed an ansatz\nfor the single particle propagator:\n\n0\n\ncut 1\n1\ncut 2\n1\ncut 3\n\n0\n\n0\n-0.08 -0.06 -0.04\n\n-0.02\n\nEk (eV)\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nFig. 1: (Color online) Comparisons between (a) QP dispersion\nEk , (b) spectral weight zk , from the YRZ propagator and the\nvalues obtained from the ARPES results by Yang et al.

The spectra are symmetric only along\nthe nodal directions where \u2206R (k, x) = 0, and the asymmetry increases away from the nodal directions.\nThe spectra observed by Yang et al [1] along three cuts\n(see inset in Fig.1) in the pseudogap phase (T =140K)\nare shown in the Brillouin zone in Fig.2(a). They are\nfits to a broadened Lorentzian plus a background term\nto be defined below. The fitting uses an implementation\nof the nonlinear least-square Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm.

For cut 1 along the nodal directions we note that\nthe fitting to a broadened Lorentzian with an almost constant background works well for all energies. For cuts 2-3\nEDC fitting, as k moves away from kF , the background\ncomponent AB (k, \u03c9) increases at lower energies. We believe this increase arises from contamination from adjacent\nk-values, due to the enhanced broadening at low energies.\nSince our interest focusses on energies near \u03bc we believe\nthis choice of background which is constant near mu is\nreasonable.\nFig.1 shows the results for the QP properties of interest. The QP dispersion, Ek in Fig.1(a) rises linearly with\nk along the nodal cut 1. Particle-hole asymmetry is evident in cuts 2 (3) with a maxima in Ek lying above (below) \u03bc, respectively. Note that these maxima are not at\nthe boundary of the reduced Brillouin zone as the case\nwould be in the presence of a broken translation symmetry, a point emphasized by Yang et al. [1] The QP weight,\nzk , represented in the dispersion plot as the line width, is\nplotted in Fig.1(b). We see an almost constant zk for cut\n1 along the nodal direction, but a fall off at the maximum\nin Ek for cuts 2 and 3 in agreement with the YRZ ansatz.\n\nFig. 3: (Color online) The red curves are the contours of the\nconstant QP energy below and close to the Fermi energy. The\nblack dots are the turning points deduced from STM interference data. The dashed blue lines are the hole Fermi pocket in\nthe normal pseudogap state. The cyan curves are the turning\npoints of the iso-energy contour of the corresponding band in\nthe SC state. Note only the turning point of the iso-energy\ncontour with the largest spectral weight are shown.\n\nThe inverse lifetime \u03b3k is essentially constant indicating\nsubstantial inelastic scattering at this elevated temperature of 140K. To summarize with reasonable parameters\nthe phenomenological YRZ propagator gives a good fit to\nthe asymmetry of ARPES spectra and describes both the\nmaxima in the QP dispersion, Ek , away from the nodal\ndirection and the accompanying drop off in the weight, zk .\nIn their original discussion of the ARPES spectra, Yang\net al. [1] presented results for a fourth scan closer to the\nantinodal point (cut 2 in Fig.4 of Ref. [1]) than scans (1-3)\nin Fig. 3 of Ref. [1]. This showed particle-hole symmetry\nin the accessible energy window near the Fermi energy\n(. 40 meV). Note, this energy window is too small to see\nthe actual gap on the particle side. However, the observation that the minimum in the gap is located right at\nthe chemical potential led Yang et al. [1] to suggest that\nthe pseudogap at the antinodal regions has a pairing origin, in agreement with the proposals of Kanigel et al. [4]\nand Anderson [8]. In a standard pairing theory the energy gap opens up along the Fermi surface whereas in the\nYRZ propagator the gap opens up at a fixed surface in kspace. As such some of use (YRZ) argue that this occurs\ndue to the presence of umklapp particle-particle scattering in addition to the Cooper channel, similar to the case\nof the half-filled Hubbard 2-leg ladder. [11] As a consequence of this difference, the RVB energy gap, \u2206R , acts as\na charge gap and only the quasiparticle excitations at the\nFermi pockets contribute to the reduced Drude weight and\n\np-3\n\n\fKai-Yu Yang1,3, H.-B.

[17]\nAt this point we wish to comment the apparent contradiction between the hole Fermi pockets associated with the\nYRZ form and the electron Fermi pockets deduced from\nrecent quantum oscillation experiments on underdoped\nYBCO samples. [18]. These experiments are performed\nat high magnetic fields and low temperatures whereas\nthe ARPES experiments of Yang et al. [1] were made at\nzero field and at a relatively high temperature of 140K.\nMeasurements of the Hall constant on the YBCO samples show a hole-like behavior under the latter conditions\nbut electron-like Hall constant under the conditions of the\nquantum oscillation experiments [19]. This suggests that\nthe sign change in the Hall constant and the electron pockets, arise from a reconstruction of the Fermi surface [20]\nat high magnetic fields, possibly related to the similar sign\nchange in the Hall constant that accompanies the superlattice charge and spin order in the static stripe phase. [19]\nThe recent STM results of Kohsaka et al., [2] requires\na generalization of the YRZ propagator to the superconducting state. Originally YRZ added a self-energy term\nin GR (k, \u03c9, x). [12] However, during this work we realized\nthat this is appropriate only in the presence of particlehole symmetry.

Kohsaka et al [2] derived the coherent QP dispersion\nin the superconducting state from the evolution of the interference pattern in the STM spectra measured in a wide\nsurface area as the tunneling voltage is changed in BSCCO\nsamples, ranging from near optimal doping (x = 0.19)\nto strongly underdoped (x = 0.06). This determines a\nset of q-vectors connecting the turning points in the isoenergy contours of the QP dispersion. [6, 21] These turning points can be compared to the values obtained from\nEq.5. We use the same values of the parameters t0 , t\u20320 ,\nt\u2032\u20320 and J as fits to the ARPES spectra at x = 0.12. Following Zhang et al [14] we assume the RVB gap value\n\u22060 (x)[= \u22060 (1 \u2212 x/xc )] drops linearly with x with a critical doping xc = 0.20. Note the value \u22060 = 0.5 is used\nin fitting to ARPES results on a sample with x = 0.12.\n\np-4\n\n\fQuasiparticles in the Pseudogap Phase of Underdoped Cuprate\n\n(a1)\nI (arbitrary units)\n\nx = 0.05\nkBT = 3mev\nkBT = 6mev\nkBT = 10mev\nkBT = 15mev\n\n(b1)\n\n(a2)\n\nx = 0.08\n\n(b2)\n\n(a3)\n\nx = 0.11\n\n(b3)\n\n(a4)\n\nx = 0.14\n\n(d4)\n\ndI/dE\n\nIn fitting to the STM results we shall allow for the possibility that the superconducting \u2206S and RVB \u22060 gaps are\nnot independent and that \u22060 may change in the superconducting state from its value in the normal state.\nThe remaining issue is the form for the superconducting gaps \u2206S (k, x). Generally we expect that \u2206S (k, x) will\nnot continue to grow as k moves beyond the Fermi pockets and the normal state QPs drop below the Fermi energy. Therefore we assume a d-wave form for \u2206S (k, x) =\n\u22060 (x)(cos kx \u2212cos ky ) only for k-values on the pockets and\nset \u2206S (k, x) to be constant beyond the pockets. This results in a two-gap description [22\u201330] with the antinodal\nenergy gap dominated by the RVB gap at underdoping\nwhile the superconducting gap along the hole pockets is\nmore important near optimal doping. We display in Fig.3\nthe evolution of the contours of constant QP energy near\n\u03bc. Note the strong variation in QP weight discussed earlier, means that only the outer contours closest to the\nzone center are relevant. The turning points of these contours are determined by the maxima in the inverse velocity\n\u22121\n(dE(k)/dk\u22a5 ) along these contours. The comparison to\nthe STM results is illustrated in Fig.3 for 4 representative\nhole densities. We see that the overall agreement is quite\nsatisfactory. Note that the contours defined by the turning\npoints are slightly larger than the underlying hole Fermi\npockets and enclose a slightly larger area. This causes\nthe hole density implied by the turning point contour to\nbe slightly larger than the actual hole density. This discrepancy is evident in Fig.3(a) of Kohsaka et al. [2]. The\nrelevant areas are plotted in Fig.5.\nNote that in the above analysis we used a standard\nd-wave form for the superconducting gap, \u2206S (k, x) =\n\u22060S (x)(cos kx \u2212 cos ky ) as observed in ARPES. Kohsaka\net al. in their STM experiments found a different angular\ndependence with a strongly reduced gap near to the nodal\ndirections. The origin of this discrepancy is not clear at\npresent. One possibility could be enhanced forward impurity scattering in the samples used in the STM experiments\nwhich Haas et al. showed can lead to a gap suppression\nnear to the nodal directions. [31] However since both techniques are sensitive only to the surface layers it is far from\nclear that such an explanation is viable.\nKohsaka et al. [2] report an abrupt end to the coherent\nQP dispersion in the STM experiments when k reaches\nthe umklapp surface. The YRZ propagator contains coherent QP also in the gapped antinodal regions. QP in\nthese regions, however, should be sensitive to the strong\nlocal variations in the hole density and the accompanying large variations in the RVB energy gap, \u22060R (x). [32]\nThis may well lead to localization of the corresponding\nQP states which lie at energies away from the chemical\npotential \u03bc. The constant value of \u03bc makes the Bogoliubov QP states associated with the superconducting gap\nmuch less sensitive to disorder. This difference offers a\nplausible explanation for the change from propagating to\nlocalized states that Kohsaka et al. [2] propose takes place\nas k reaches the umklapp surface.\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n-E (t)\n\n0.1\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n-E (t)\n\n0.1\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n-E (t)\n\n0.1\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n-E (t)\n\nFig. 6: (Color online): The upper panels are the angle integrated spectra I(E, T, x) near the chemical potential (at zero\ntemperature) for various doping (0.05 - 0.14). The lower panels are the first order derivative of I(E, T, x), with the peak\nposition Ep shifting towards negative electron energy (i.e. positive hole energy), opposite to the shift in the chemical potential. Blue, black, cyan and red curves are for the temperatures kB T = 3, 6, 10, 15 meV. The same parameters as shown\nin Table 1 are used, except \u22060 = 0.4. Experimental data for\nLa2 CuO4 can be found in Fig.xxx of Hashimoto et al [7].\n\nKohsaka et al. [2] reported characteristic tunneling\nspectra, which we can compare to the DOS obtained\nfrom the superconducting propagator in Eq.5 N (\u03c9) =\nP\ni,k zi,k \u03b4Ei,k \u2212\u03c9 , as shown in Fig.4. The experimental results are shown in Fig.4 as the dashed black curves. At\nhigher hole densities, 0.1 < x < 0.19, the spectra are\ndominated by the maximum superconducting gap which is\nlarger than the RVB gap, \u22060 (x). As a result the QP bands\nnear the Fermi energy are all split by \u2206S (k) with symmetric low energy DOS. At lower hole density the RVB gap\n\u22060 (x) rises and exceeds the maximum of \u2206S (k) leading to\ntwo structures in the DOS. One at lower energy related to\n\u2206S (k, x) at the tips of arc, and second at higher energies\nassociated with the RVB gap. If we keep the RVB gap \u22060\nto the value used in the ARPES fits, the DOS shown in\nblue in Fig.4 displays a much stronger particle-hole asymmetry than the experiments. However, if we reduce the\nvalue of \u22060 to 0.2, the agreement is much improved, suggesting that the two gaps are not independent of each\nother. Note that the total gap near the antinodal points\ndoes not change so much. We do not claim a quantitative\nfit to the STM DOS but the main features are reproduced\nat least qualitatively, by the YRZ ansatz.\nNext we turn to recent angle integrated photoemission (AIPES) experiments on hole doped La2 CuO4 which\nshowed several anomalous features at underdoping in the\nnormal pseudogap phases. First the total DOS (i.e. angle integrated) show an approximate linear dependence on\n\np-5\n\n0.1\n\n\fKai-Yu Yang1,3, H.-B. Yang2, P. D. Johnson2, T. M.

It shows a clear quadratic\ntemperature dependence.\n\nthe hole energy, E, with only a small quadratic correction\nwhich grew with increasing x. This behavior contrasts\nwith the constant DOS expected from a small hole pocket\nin a valence band in two dimensions. Secondly, the shift\nof the peak in the first derivative of the angle integrated\nspectra (I(E, T, x)), dI/dE \u221d T 2 /Tcoh approximately and\nmoves to positive hole energies (not negative). The value\nof Tcoh (x) increases with increasing, x. Interestingly, these\nanomalous features are reproduced by the YRZ model dispersion for quasiparticles. In Fig. 6 (a) we show the results for the angle integrated spectra I(E, T, x) calculated\nby multiplying the total DOS for quasiparticles by the\nFermi function. An approximate linear dependence on E\nis evident. In Fig. 6 (b) we show that the peak Ep of\nthe derivative | dI/dE | moves to positive hole energies\nopposite to the negative shift of the chemical potential,\nwith a roughly quadratic dependence on the temperature,\nFig. 7. The resulting characteristic coherence temperature Tcoh (x) increases with increasing x. The key anomalous properties of the AIPES spectra are well reproduced\nby the YRZ form.\nThe YRZ ansatz for the single particle propagator explains the anomalous properties of the underdoped pseudogap phase as a precursor to the Mott insulating state at\nstoichiometry. The recent spectroscopic measurements on\nunderdoped BSCCO using ARPES and STM have shed\nnew light on the evolution of the QP properties. In this\npaper we have shown that the YRZ ansatz provides the\nbasis to understand the key features of the new experimental data such as particle-hole asymmetry, energy dispersion and wave vector dependent spectral weight of normal\nstate QP as well as the coherent QP dispersion and DOS\nin the superconducting state over a range of hole densities.\nWe thank Wei-Qiang Chen, Seamus Davis, Carsten\nHonerkamp, Manfred Sigrist and Alexei Tsvelik for discussions.
