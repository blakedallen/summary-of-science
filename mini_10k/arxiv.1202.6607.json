The set of fixed points X \u03bc of \u03bc is called the real\npart of (X, \u03bc). If it is clear from the context which \u03bc is considered then\nthe real part will be denoted by RX. In our paper, we are interested in\nthe algebraic case. This means that X is a complex algebraic variety,\nwhich we will assume non-singular though this is not needed for the\nSupported by SFB/TR 12, Symmetry and universality in mesoscopic systems,\nof the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nD. AKHIEZER AND S. CUPIT-FOUTOU\n\ndefinition of a real structure. Also, \u03bc is algebraic in the sense that for\nany function f regular at x \u2208 X the function f \u25e6 \u03bc is regular at \u03bc(x).\nIt is not easy to classify all real structures on a given variety X. Much\nwork is done for compact toric varieties, where one has the notion of\na toric real structure. Namely, if X is a toric variety acted on by an\nalgebraic torus T then a real structure \u03bc : X \u2192 X is said to be toric if\n\u03bc normalizes the T -action. It is natural to classify toric real structures\nup to conjugation by toric automorphisms, i.e., by automorphisms of\nX normalizing the T -action. Again, such a classification is not easy.\nFor toric surfaces and threefolds it was obtained by C. Delaunay; see\n[De].\nIn the toric case, there is a notion of a canonical real structure. This\nis a real structure which is usually defined as complex conjugation on\nthe open T -orbit, but we prefer a slightly different and more general\ndefinition. Let \u03c3 : T \u2192 T be the involutive anti-holomorphic automorphism of the real Lie group T which coincides with inversion on the\nmaximal compact torus Tc \u2282 T . If T \u2243 (C\u2217 )n then the real form defined by \u03c3 is split, i.e., isomorphic to (R\u2217 )n . A canonical real structure\non a toric variety X is a real structure which satisfies\n(\u2217)\n\n\u03bc(a * x) = \u03c3(a) * \u03bc(x)\n\nfor all x \u2208 X, a \u2208 T . Of course, a canonical real structure is uniquely\ndefined by the image of one point in the open orbit and any two canonical real structures are related by \u03bc\u2032 (x) = t * \u03bc(x), where t \u2208 T and\n\u03c3(t) * t = 1.\nOur goal is to generalize this notion to varieties acted on by reductive algebraic groups. Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group\ndefined over C. We recall that an algebraic involution \u03b8 of G is called\na Weyl involution if \u03b8(t) = t\u22121 for all t in some algebraic torus T \u2282 G.\nSuch an involution is known to be unique up to conjugation by an inner\nautomorphism. By Cartan Fixed Point Theorem, one can always find\na maximal compact subgroup K \u2282 G, such that \u03b8(K) = K. Then the\ncorresponding Cartan involution \u03c4 commutes with \u03b8 and the product\n\u03c3 = \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03b8 = \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c4 is an involutive anti-holomorphic automorphism of G\ndefining the split real form. Assume now that G acts on an algebraic\nvariety X. Then a real structure \u03bc : X \u2192 X is called canonical if \u03bc\nsatisfies the above condition (\u2217) for all x \u2208 X, a \u2208 G. We remark that\nit suffices to check (\u2217) only for a \u2208 K, in which case one can replace \u03c3\nby \u03b8.\nThe most natural generalization of toric varieties to the case of reductive algebraic groups is the notion of spherical varieties, which we\nrecall in Section 1.\n\n\fON THE CANONICAL REAL STRUCTURE ON WONDERFUL VARIETIES\n\n3\n\nSuppose X is affine and non-singular. For X spherical a canonical\nreal structure \u03bc : X \u2192 X always exists ([A], Theorem 1.2). However,\nin the non-spherical case such a structure may not exist even if X is\nhomogeneous ([AP], Proposition 6.3).\nIn this paper, we study the problem of existence of a canonical real\nstructure for all homogeneous spherical varieties, affine or not affine.\nWe also consider the similar question for some complete spherical varieties, namely the so-called wonderful varieties. The definition of wonderful and strict wonderful varieties is recalled in Section 1.\nWe start with a finiteness theorem for real structures on wonderful\nvarieties (Theorem 2.4). Then we prove some topological properties\nof a canonical real structure on a wonderful variety provided such a\nstructure exists (Theorem 3.10). After that we show that a canonical\nreal structure exists and is uniquely defined for homogeneous spherical\nvarieties G/H with H self-normalizing (Theorem 4.12) and for their\nwonderful completions (Theorem 4.13). As an application we show that\nfor a spherical subgroup H \u2282 G, whose normalizer is self-normalizing,\nthere is always an anti-holomorphic involution \u03c3 : G \u2192 G, defining the\nsplit real form and such that \u03c3(H) = H (Theorem 4.14). Finally, we\ngive an estimate of the total number of real form orbits in RX for the\ncanonical real structure on a strict wonderful variety X (Theorem 5.19).\n1. Wonderful varieties\nRecall that G is a connected reductive algebraic group over C. A\nnormal algebraic G-variety X is called spherical if X contains an open\norbit of a Borel subgroup B \u2282 G. We denote the open orbits of B and\nG on X by XB\u25e6 and XG\u25e6 respectively.\nThe following definition is due to D. Luna ([Lu1]). An algebraic\nG-variety X is called wonderful if\n(i) X is complete and smooth;\n(ii) X admits an open G-orbit whose complement consists of a finite\nunion of smooth prime divisors X1 . . . , Xr with normal crossings;\n(iii) the G-orbit closures of X are given by the partial intersections of\nthe Xi 's.\nRemark that a wonderful variety X has a unique closed G-orbit. The\nlatter is the full intersection of the boundary divisors Xi of X.\nD. Luna proved that wonderful G-varieties are spherical. The connected center of G acts trivially on a wonderful variety, so if G acts\neffectively then G is semisimple. If a spherical homogeneous space G/H\nadmits an equivariant wonderful embedding then such an embedding\nis unique up to a G-isomorphism; see [Lu1] and references therein.\n\n\f4\n\nD. AKHIEZER AND S. CUPIT-FOUTOU\n\nBy a theorem of F. Knop, a wondferful equivariant embedding of\nG/H always exists if the spherical subgroup H is self-normalizing in\nG; see [K].\nProposition 1.1. Let X be a wonderful variety and let XG\u25e6 = G/H.\nThen H has finite index in its normalizer.\nProof. See Section 4.4 in [Br1].\n\n\u0003\n\nA wonderful variety is called strict if each of its points has a selfnormalizing stabilizer. The class of strict wonderful varieties includes\nflag varieties and De Concini-Procesi compactifications ([DP]). Strict\nwonderful varieties are classified in [BCF].\nFor any variety X, let Aut(X) denote the automorphism group of\nX. We will need the following proposition describing the identity component Aut0 (X) for a wonderful G-variety X.\nProposition 1.2 ([Br2], Theorem 2.4.2). If X is wonderful under G\nthen Aut0 (X) is semisimple and X is wonderful under the action of\nAut0 (X).\nIn addition, we have the following proposition, for which we could\nnot find a reference.\nProposition 1.3. Let X be a wonderful variety. Then Aut0 (X) has\nfinite index in Aut(X).\nProof. Write XG\u25e6 = G/H, where H is the stabilizer of a point x0 \u2208 XG\u25e6 .\nLet N be the normalizer of H in G. By Proposition 1.1 the orbit N * x0\nis finite. For any \u03b1 \u2208 Aut(X) and g \u2208 Aut0 (X) put\n\u03b9\u03b1 (g) = \u03b1 * g * \u03b1\u22121 .\nLet L denote the group of all automorphisms of the group Aut0 (X).\nThen we have the homomorphism\n\u03c6 : Aut(X) \u2192 L, \u03c6(\u03b1) = \u03b9\u03b1 ,\nwhose image contains the group of inner automorphisms of Aut0 (X).\nSince the latter group is semisimple by Proposition 1.2, Im(\u03c6) has\nfinitely many connected components. We now prove that Ker(\u03c6) is\nfinite. It then follows that Aut(X) has finitely many connected components.\nIf \u03b1 \u2208 Ker(\u03c6) then \u03b1 commutes with all automorphisms from G.\nThus \u03b1(gx0) = g\u03b1(x0 ) for all g \u2208 G. Since X has only one open Gorbit, we have \u03b1(XG\u25e6 ) = XG\u25e6 and, in particular, \u03b1(x0 ) = ax0 for some\na \u2208 G. Now take g \u2208 H. Then\nax0 = \u03b1(x0 ) = \u03b1(gx0 ) = g\u03b1(x0 ) = gax0 ,\n\n\fON THE CANONICAL REAL STRUCTURE ON WONDERFUL VARIETIES\n\n5\n\nhence aga\u22121 \u2208 H and a \u2208 N. Since the N-orbit of x0 is finite, there\nare only finitely many possibilities for ax0 . But, for \u03b1(x0 ) fixed, \u03b1\nis uniquely determined on the open G-orbit and thus everywhere on\nX.\n\u0003\n2. Finiteness theorem\nThe group Aut(X) acts on the set of real structures on X by\n\u03bc 7\u2192 \u03b1 * \u03bc * \u03b1\u22121 .\nFor X wonderful, we prove that this action has only finitely many\norbits.\nTheorem 2.4. Let X be a wonderful variety. Then, up to an automorphism of X, there are only finitely many real structures on X.\nProof. Assume that X has at least one real structure \u03bc0 . Then Aut(X)orbits on the set of real structures on X are in one-to-one correspondence with the cohomology classes from H 1 (Z2 , Aut(X)), where the\ngenerator \u03b3 \u2208 Z2 acts on Aut(X) by sending \u03b1 to \u03bc0 \u03b1\u03bc0. We now use\nthe exact cohomology sequence, associated with the normal subgroup\nAut0 (X) \u22b3 Aut(X). From Corollary 3 in I.5.5 of [S] it follows that\nH 1 (Z2 , Aut(X)) is finite if the following two conditions are fulfilled:\n(1) Aut(X)/Aut0 (X) is finite;\n(2) for the Z2 -action on Aut0 (X) obtained by twisting the given\naction by an arbitrary cocycle a \u2208 Z 1 (Z2 , Aut(X)) the corresponding\ncohomology set H 1 (Z2 , a Aut0 (X)) is finite.\nWe have just proved (1). Since Aut0 (X) is linear algebraic, (2) follows\nfrom Borel-Serre's Theorem (see [BS]).\n\u0003\n3. General properties of equivariant real structures\nLet X be a non-singular complex algebraic variety with a real structure \u03bc : X \u2192 X. Suppose G is a connected algebraic group acting on\nX and let \u03c3 : G \u2192 G be an involutive anti-holomorphic automorphism\nof G as a real algebraic group. Then the fixed point subgroup\nG\u03c3 = {g \u2208 G | \u03c3(g) = g}\nis real algebraic and its identity component G\u03c30 is a closed real Lie\nsubgroup in G.\nWe call \u03bc a \u03c3-equivariant real structure if\n\u03bc(g * x) = \u03c3(g) * \u03bc(x)\n\nfor all g \u2208 G, x \u2208 X.\n\n\f6\n\nD. AKHIEZER AND S. CUPIT-FOUTOU\n\nLater on, we will be interested in the case when G\u03c3 is a split real form\nof a reductive group G; see Introduction. However, in the following\nelementary lemma G and \u03c3 are arbitrary.\nLemma 3.5. Let H \u2282 G be an algebraic subgroup and let X = G/H.\nSuppose x0 \u2208 RX. Then the connected component of RX through x0\ncoincides with G\u03c30 * x0 . The orbit G\u03c30 * x0 is Zariski dense in X.\nProof. Let n be the complex dimension of X. Then the real dimension\nof RX is also n. Since \u03bc is \u03c3-equivariant, we have G\u03c3 (x0 ) \u2282 RX. Thus\nit suffices to show that dim G\u03c30 (x0 ) \u2265 n. Let Gx0 be the stabilizer of x0\nin G. Then G\u03c30 \u2229 Gx0 is a totally real submanifold in Gx0 , hence\ndimR G\u03c30 \u2229 Gx0 \u2264 dimC Gx0 ,\nand so we obtain\ndim G\u03c30 * x0 = dim G\u03c30 \u2212 dim G\u03c30 \u2229 Gx0 \u2265 dimC G \u2212 dimC Gx0 = n.\nFinally, since G\u03c30 * x0 \u2282 X is a totally real submanifold of maximal\npossible dimension, G\u03c30 * x0 is not contained in an algebraic subvariety\nof dimension smaller than n.\n\u0003\nFrom now on G is reductive. We need some preparatory lemmas on\nthe involution \u03c3 : G \u2192 G defining the split real form of G. We also\nfix some notation, which will be used all the time in the sequel. So let\nT \u2282 G be a torus, on which \u03c3 acts as the involutive anti-holomorphic\nautomorphism with fixed point subgroup being the non-compact real\npart of T . In coordinates, if T \u2243 (C\u2217 )r then\n\u03c3(z1 , . . . , zr ) = (z\u03041 , . . . , z\u0304r ), z = (z1 , . . . , zr ) \u2208 (C\u2217 )r .\nLemma 3.6. Let \u03c7 be a character of T . Then \u03c7 \u25e6 \u03c3 = \u03c7.\nProof. Take t in the non-compact real part of T . Then \u03c3(t) = t and\nthe value of \u03c7 is real. This shows that the weights \u03c7 \u25e6 \u03c3 and \u03c7 coincide\non real points, hence also everywhere by analytic extension.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.7. Let g be the Lie algebra of G. Denote the associated\ninvolution of g again by \u03c3. Then all root spaces in g are \u03c3-stable.\nProof. Let \u03b1 : T \u2192 C\u2217 be a root, g\u03b1 the corresponding root space,\nX\u03b1 \u2208 g\u03b1 , and t \u2208 T . Then\nAd(t) * X\u03b1 = \u03b1(t)X\u03b1\nimplies\nAd(\u03c3(t)) * \u03c3(X\u03b1 ) = \u03b1(t) \u03c3(X\u03b1 )\n\n\fON THE CANONICAL REAL STRUCTURE ON WONDERFUL VARIETIES\n\n7\n\nor, equivalently,\nAd(t) * \u03c3(X\u03b1 ) = \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c3(t) \u03c3(X\u03b1 ) = \u03b1(t) \u03c3(X\u03b1 ),\nwhere the last equality follows from Lemma 3.6. Therefore \u03c3(X\u03b1 ) \u2208 g\u03b1 ,\nshowing that the root spaces are \u03c3-stable.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.8. With the above choice of T we have \u03c3(B) = B and\n\u03c3(P ) = P for any Borel subgroup B \u2282 G containing T and any parabolic subgroup P \u2282 G containing B.\nProof. The Lie algebras of p and b are spanned by root spaces and the\nLie algebra t of T , so Lemma 3.7 applies.\n\u0003\nWe will assume throughout the paper that T, B and P are chosen as\nin Corollary 3.8.\nProposition 3.9. With the above choice of P , define a self-map of the\nflag variety X = G/P by \u03bc(g * P ) = \u03c3(g) * P . Then \u03bc is a \u03c3-equivariant\nreal structure on X. Such a structure is uniquely defined. The set\nRX is the unique closed G\u03c30 -orbit on X. In particular, the (possibly\ndisconnected) real form G\u03c3 is transitive on RX.\nProof. Clearly, the map \u03bc is correctly defined, anti-holomorphic, \u03c3equivariant, and involutive. If there is another \u03c3-equivariant real structure \u03bc\u2032 on X, then the product \u03bc\u2032 * \u03bc is an automorphism of X commuting with the G-action. Since P is self-normalizing, such an automorphism is the identity map, hence \u03bc\u2032 = \u03bc. By construction, the\nbase point e * P is contained in RX. According to Lemma 3.5, each\nconnected component of RX is a closed G\u03c30 -orbit. By [W] such an orbit\nis unique, so RX is connected and coincides with that orbit. The last\nassertion is now obvious.\n\u0003\nFor a wonderful variety X, the existence of a \u03c3-equivariant real structure requires some work involving Luna-Vust invariants of spherical\nhomogeneous spaces. We postpone this until the next section. Here,\nassuming that such a structure \u03bc exists, we study geometric properties\nof RX. The notation is as in Section 1. In particular,\nY = X1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 Xr\nis the unique closed G-orbit in X. Note that \u03bc(Y ) = Y and RX \u2229 Y\nis the unique closed G\u03c30 -orbit in Y by Proposition 3.9.\nTheorem 3.10. Let X be any wonderful G-variety equipped with a\n\u03c3-equivariant real structure \u03bc. Then:\n(i) G\u03c30 has finitely many orbits on RX;\n(ii) RX \u2229 Gx 6= \u2205 for any x \u2208 X;\n\n\f8\n\nD. AKHIEZER AND S. CUPIT-FOUTOU\n\n(iii) there is exactly one closed G\u03c30 -orbit in RX; this orbit is contained in the closed G-orbit and is G\u03c3 -homogeneous;\n(iv) RX is connected.\nProof. (i) RX is a non-empty real algebraic set. In particular, RX has\nfinitely many connected components. By Lemma 3.5, each of them is\none G\u03c30 -orbit.\n(ii) We choose B as in Corollary 3.8. We prove first that \u03bc preserves\nG-orbits. This is clear for the open orbit, because its \u03bc-image is also an\nopen orbit which is unique. Since the orbit structure is well understood\n(see Section 1), it is enough to prove that \u03bc(Xi ) = Xi , where Xi are\nthe boundary divisors. Equivalently, it suffices to prove that the Ginvariant valuation vi centered on Xi is \u03bc-invariant in the sense that\nvi (f \u25e6 \u03bc) = vi (f )\nfor any f \u2208 C(X) \\ {0}. It is enough to check this on B-eigenfunctions\n(see Appendix A.1), but then Lemma 3.6 yields the required equality.\nNow, let G * x be any G-orbit on X and let cl(G * x) be its Zariski\nclosure within X. Since G * x is \u03bc-stable, so is cl(G * x). Note that\nY \u2282 cl(G * x), therefore Z := RX \u2229 cl(G * x) 6= \u2205. Furthermore, cl(G * x)\nis a non-singular variety and Z \u2282 cl(G * x) is a totally real submanifold\nof maximal possible dimension. Therefore Z is not contained in the\nboundary cl(G * x) \\ G * x.\n(iii) Given a closed orbit G\u03c30 * y \u2282 RX, consider the orbit G\u03c3 * y,\nwhich is also closed, and take a fixed point of the real form B \u03c3 \u2282 B\nthereon. The existence of such a point follows from Borel's theorem\nfor connected split solvable groups. Assuming B \u03c3 * y = y, we also have\nB * y = y. But then G * y is projective, i.e., G * y = Y . Thus our\nstatement is reduced to the case of flag varieties, and we can apply\nProposition 3.9.\n(iv) Assume RX is disconnected. Since RX \u2229 Y is connected, we can\nfind a connected component W of RX, such that W \u2229 Y = \u2205. Then\nW is a closed G\u03c30 -orbit and G\u03c3 * W is a closed G\u03c3 -orbit, which also has\nempty intersection with Y . On the other hand, by the above argument,\nB \u03c3 has a fixed point on G\u03c3 * W . Since that fixed point is also fixed by\nB, it belongs to the closed G-orbit Y . We get a contradiction showing\nthat RX is in fact connected.\n\u0003\n4. The canonical real structure\nRecall that T and B are chosen as in Corollary 3.8.\n\n\fON THE CANONICAL REAL STRUCTURE ON WONDERFUL VARIETIES\n\n9\n\nProposition 4.11. Any spherical subgroup H \u2282 G is conjugate to\n\u03c3(H) by an inner automorphism of G.\nProof. We note first that \u03c3(H) is a spherical subgroup of G. We shall\nprove that the Luna-Vust invariants attached to X1 = G/H and X2 =\nG/\u03c3(H) are the same and then use the theorem in Appendix A.1, from\nwhere we also take the notations.\nConsider the map \u03bc : X1 \u2192 X2 defined by\n\u03bc\n\nX1 \u220b g * H 7\u2192 \u03c3(g) * \u03c3(H) \u2208 X2 .\nWe show that \u03bc defines a bijection between the sets of B-eigenfunctions\non X2 and X1 . Moreover, the associated map \u039b+ (X2 ) \u2212\u2192 \u039b+ (X1 ) is\nthe identity map. Namely, let f be a B-eigenfunction in C(X2 ) and\nlet \u03bb be its B-weight. Then the complex conjugate of f \u25e6 \u03bc is a Beigenfunction in C(X1 ) with weight \u03bb \u25e6 \u03c3. The latter is equal to \u03bb by\nLemma 3.6. Since we can apply the same argument to the map \u03bc\u22121 ,\nit follows that the weight lattices of X1 and X2 coincide and \u03bc induces\nthe identity map on \u039b+ (X2 ) = \u039b+ (X1 ).\nFurther, consider the map V(X1 ) \u2192 V(X2 ), defined by\nv 7\u2192 (f 7\u2192 v(f \u25e6 \u03bc)).\nThis map is obviously bijective. Namely, its inverse is defined analogously by means of the mapping \u03bc\u22121 : X2 \u2192 X1 .\nFinally, there is a natural bijection \u03b9 : DG,X1 \u2192 DG,X2 sending D to\n\u03c02 [\u03c3(\u03c01\u22121 (D)] where \u03c01 and \u03c02 are the projections from G to X1 and\nX2 respectively. For this mapping, \u03c6\u03b9(D) evaluated on \u03bb \u25e6 \u03c3 gives the\nsame result as \u03c6D evaluated on \u03bb. By Lemma 3.6, \u03bb \u25e6 \u03c3 coincides with\n\u03bb, and so we have \u03c6\u03b9(D) = \u03c6D . Similarly, G\u03b9(D) = \u03c3(GD ) = GD because\nGD is a parabolic subgroup containing B.\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.12. Let H be a spherical subgroup of G and a \u2208 G such\nthat \u03c3(H) = aHa\u22121 . The assignment\n\u03bc0 : gH 7\u2192 \u03c3(g)aH\ndefines an anti-holomorphic \u03c3-equivariant diffeomorphism of G/H. If\nH is self-normalizing then this map is involutive, hence a \u03c3-equivariant\nreal structure on G/H. Furthermore, for H self-normalizing a \u03c3equivariant real structure on G/H is uniquely defined.\nProof. The first assertion follows from Proposition 4.11. Further, since\n\u03c3 is an involution of G, \u03c3(a)a belongs to the normalizer of H in G. The\nlatter coincides with H. This proves the second assertion. The product\nof two \u03c3-equivariant real structures on G/H is an automorphism of\n\n\f10\n\nD. AKHIEZER AND S. CUPIT-FOUTOU\n\nG/H commuting with the G-action. For H self-normalizing in G such\nan automorphism is the identity map, and the last assertion follows. \u0003\nTheorem 4.13. Let H be a self-normalizing spherical subgroup of G\nand let X be the wonderful completion of G/H. Then there exists one\nand only one \u03c3-equivariant real structure of X.\nProof. Let \u03b9 : G/H \u2192 X be the given wonderful completion and let\n\u1fd1 : G/H \u2192 X\u0304 be the corresponding anti-holomorphic map with X\u0304\nbeing the complex conjugate of X. Recall that X\u0304 = X as sets and\nthat the sheafs of regular functions of X\u0304 and X are complex conjugate.\nWe endow X\u0304 with the G-action (g, x) 7\u2192 \u03c3(g) * x, where (g, x) 7\u2192 g * x\nis the given action of G on X. Note that this new action is regular on\nX\u0304.\nConsider the real structure \u03bc0 introduced in Theorem 4.12. Then\n\u1fd1 \u25e6 \u03bc0 is again a wonderful completion of G/H. Since two wonderful\ncompletions of G/H are G-isomorphic, there exists a G-isomorphism\n\u03bc : X \u2192 X\u0304 such that \u03bc \u25e6 \u03b9 = \u1fd1 \u25e6 \u03bc0 . The map \u03bc defines a \u03c3-equivariant\nreal structure on X.\nFinally, a \u03c3-equivariant real structure on X is defined by its restriction to the open G-orbit in X. The restriction is unique by Theorem 4.12.\n\u0003\nIn the remainder, the real structure defined in Theorem 4.13 is called\nthe canonical real structure of X. We want to give here a grouptheoretical application of Theorem 4.13.\nTheorem 4.14. If H \u2282 G is a spherical subgroup with self-normalizing\nnormalizer then there exists an anti-holomorphic involution \u03c3 : G \u2192 G,\ndefining the split real form and such that \u03c3(H) = H. Moreover, one\ncan find a Borel subgroup B \u2282 G, such that B * H is open in G and\n\u03c3(B) = B.\nProof. Let N be the normalizer of H in G. We start with some \u03c3\nand take a \u2208 G as in Theorem 4.12, i.e., \u03c3(H) = aHa\u22121 . Then, of\ncourse, \u03c3(N) = aNa\u22121 . Let X be a wonderful equivariant completion\nof G/N and let \u03bc be the canonical \u03c3-equivariant real structure on X.\nBy Theorem 3.10 we can find a \u03bc-fixed point in the open orbit. Let\n\u03bc(g0 * N) = g0 * N. Replace \u03c3 by \u03c31 = i\u22121\ng0 \u03c3ig0 , where ig0 is the inner\n\u22121\nautomorphism of G given by x 7\u2192 g0 xg0 . Also, replace \u03bc by \u03bc1 =\ng0\u22121\u03bcg0 . A straightforward calculation shows that \u03bc1 (gx) = \u03c31 (g)\u03bc1(x)\nfor all g \u2208 G, x \u2208 X, i.e., \u03bc1 is a \u03c31 -equivariant real structure on X.\nMoreover, for the new pair (\u03bc1 , \u03c31 ) we have\n\u03bc1 (e * N) = (g0\u22121 \u03bcg0 )(e * N) = g0\u22121 \u03bc(g0 * N) = e * N.\n\n\fON THE CANONICAL REAL STRUCTURE ON WONDERFUL VARIETIES 11\n\nComparing the stabilizers at e * N and \u03bc1 (e * N), we get\n\u03c31 (N) = N.\nIt follows that\n\u22121\n\u22121\nN = \u03c31 (N) = i\u22121\ng0 \u03c3 ig0 (N) = g0 \u03c3(g0 ) \u03c3(N) \u03c3(g0 ) g0 .\n\nAs we have seen, \u03c3(N) = aNa\u22121 . Substituting this in the previous\nequality, we get g0\u22121 \u03c3(g0 )a \u2208 N, and it follows that \u03c31 (H) = H.\nNow, assuming \u03c3(H) = H consider the subset \u03a9 \u2282 G/B whose\npoints correspond to the Borel subgroups B\u2217 \u2282 G with B\u2217 * H open\nin G. Then \u03a9 is Zariski open and \u03c3-stable. The subset of \u03c3-fixed\nBorel subgroups is a totally real submanifold in G/B, having maximal\npossible dimension. Thus its intersection with \u03a9 is non-empty.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.15. The normalizer of a spherical subgroup is in general\nnot self-normalizing, see Example 4 in [Av]. In Theorem 4.14, we do\nnot know if the condition of N being self-normalizing is essential.\n5. Real part: local structure and G\u03c30 -orbits\nLet X be a strict wonderful G-variety of rank r equipped with the\ncanonical real structure \u03bc. For a complex vector space V and an antilinear map \u03bd : V \u2192 V we denote by the same letter \u03bd the induced\nanti-holomorphic map of P(V ).\nProposition 5.16. There exist a simple G-module V with the associated representation \u03c1 : G \u2192 GL(V ), an anti-linear involutive map\n\u03bd : V \u2192 V , and an embedding \u03c6 : X \u2192 P(V ), such that\n(i) \u03bd(\u03c1(g) * v) = \u03c1(\u03c3(g)) * \u03bd(v) (v \u2208 V ),\n(ii) \u03c6(gx) = \u03c1(g) * \u03c6(x) (x \u2208 X) and\n(iii) \u03c6(\u03bcx) = \u03bd\u03c6(x) (x \u2208 X).\nIn particular, RX is G\u03c3 -equivariantly embedded into the real projective\nspace RP(V ) \u2282 P(V ), defined by \u03bd.\nProof. Since X is a non-singular projective G-variety, X can be Gequivariantly embedded into the projectivization of a G-module. Let\n\u03c6 : X \u2192 P(V ) be such an embedding and let \u03c1 : G \u2192 GL(V ) denote the representation associated to V . Since X is a strict wonderful\nvariety, we may choose V to be simple; see [P].\nNow, equip the complex conjugate vector space V\u0304 with the G-module\nstructure given by g 7\u2192 \u03c1(\u03c3(g)). By Lemma 3.6, it follows that the\nG-modules V and V\u0304 are isomorphic. In other words, we have an antilinear map \u03bd : V \u2192 V satisfying (i). Though \u03bd is not necessarily\ninvolutive, we can modify \u03bd to get this property. As in Appendix A.2,\n\n\f12\n\nD. AKHIEZER AND S. CUPIT-FOUTOU\n\nlet v \u2212 be a lowest weight vector of V . Then \u03bd(v \u2212 ) is also a lowest\nweight vector, hence \u03bd(v \u2212 ) = cv \u2212 for some c \u2208 C\u2217 . This implies\n\u03bd 2 (v \u2212 ) = \u03bd(cv \u2212 ) = c\u0304 * \u03bd(v \u2212 ) = |c|2 v \u2212 . Replacing \u03bd by \u03bd/|c|, we get an\ninvolutive anti-linear map satisfying (i).\nSince (ii) is clear from the construction, it remains to show (iii). Note\nthat \u03bd \u25e6\u03c6\u25e6\u03bc is another G-equivariant embedding of X into P(V ). Thus\n(iii) follows from the uniqueness of such an embedding; see [P].\n\u0003\nLet Z be the slice defined in Appendix A.2. We show that Z can\nbe chosen to be \u03bc-stable. As we have seen in Proposition 5.16, the\nline C * v \u2212 is \u03bd-stable. So we may assume that \u03bd(v \u2212 ) = v \u2212 . Then\nthe tangent space W := Tv\u2212 G * v \u2212 is also \u03bd-stable. Consider the real\nvector space RV = {v \u2208 V | \u03bd(v) = v} and let RW = W \u2229 RV . Then\nRW is stable under L\u03c3 and, also, under the Lie algebra l\u03c3 of L\u03c3 . Now,\nthe center of l\u03c3 is contained in the center of the complexified algebra\nl = l\u03c3 \u2297C and is therefore represented by semisimple endomorphisms of\nRV . The complete reducibility theorem for reductive Lie algebras over\nR implies that RW has a l\u03c3 -stable complement in RV ; see [C], Ch.IV,\n\u00a7 4. Call this complement ER . The complexification ER \u2297 C \u2282 V is\nl-stable and therefore L-stable. So we can take E = ER \u2297 C. Note\nthat ER = E \u2229 RV is not just l\u03c3 -stable, but also L\u03c3 -stable even if L\u03c3\nis disconnected.\nObviously, \u03bd(E) = E. Furthermore, the linear form \u03b7 in Appendix A.2 can be chosen real. Therefore, using (iii) of Proposition 5.16,\nwe see that \u03bc(Z) = Z. Note that P u * Z is \u03bc-stable and R(P u * Z) =\n(P u )\u03c3 * RZ.\nThe first assertion of the following proposition is a real analogue of\nLocal Structure Theorem in [BLV]; see also Appendix A.2.\nProposition 5.17. (i) The natural mapping\n(P u )\u03c3 \u00d7 (RZ) \u2192 (P u )\u03c3 * RZ = R(P u * Z)\nis a (P u )\u03c3 -equivariant isomorphism.\n(ii) Each G\u03c30 -orbit in RX contains points of the slice Z.\nProof. The first assertion follows readily from Local Structure Theorem\nand the above construction of Z.\nTo prove (ii), take a point x \u2208 RX. Since X is wonderful, the orbit\nG * x is not contained\nin a prime divisor D \u2208 D(X). The intersection\n\u0001\nG * x \u2229 \u222aD(X) D is a proper Zariski closed subset in G * x. By the\nlast assertion of Lemma 3.5, this subset does not contain G\u03c30 * x. Thus\nG\u03c30 * x \u2229 X \\ \u222aD(X) D 6= \u2205, and (ii) follows from (i).\n\u0003\n\n\fON THE CANONICAL REAL STRUCTURE ON WONDERFUL VARIETIES 13\n\nIn the remainder, x denotes a real point in XG\u25e6 \u2229 Z and H \u2282 G is the\nstabilizer of x. We assume that \u03c3(B) = B and \u03bc(Z) = Z. It follows\nthat \u03c3(H) = H. Note also that B * H is open in G because the orbit\nB * x is open in X.\nAs we recall in Appendix A.2, T acts linearly on Z and the corresponding characters, say \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3r , are linearly independent. These\ncharacters are usually called spherical roots of X. Further, we have\n\\\nT \u2229H =\nker \u03b3i .\ni\n\nSet\nA = T /T \u2229 H\nand let 2 A \u2282 A be the subgroup of elements of order at most 2. Note\nthat any element t \u2208 T can be uniquely written as\nt = t0 t1 ,\n\nwhere t0 \u2208 T0\u03c3 and \u03c3(t1 ) = t\u22121\n1 .\n\nSuch a decomposition of t will be referred to as the decomposition of t\nwith respect to \u03c3.\nProposition 5.18. The T0\u03c3 -orbits of RZ \u2229 XG\u25e6 are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of 2 A. In particular, the number of such\norbits does not exceed 2r .\nProof. Let t \u2208 T and let y = t*x be a real point. Then (\u03b3i \u25e6\u03c3)(t) = \u03b3i (t)\nfor every spherical root \u03b3i of X. By Lemma 3.6, it follows that \u03b3i (t) is\nreal-valued. If t = t0 t1 is the decomposition of t with respect to \u03c3, then\nwe have \u03b3i (t1 ) = \u00b11. Therefore t21 \u2208 H. Assigning to y \u2208 RZ \u2229 XG\u25e6\nthe image of t1 in A, we get a correctly defined map from the set of\nT0\u03c3 -orbits on RZ \u2229 XG\u25e6 to 2 A:\n\u03b1 : T0\u03c3 \\ (RZ \u2229 XG\u25e6 ) \u2192 2 A.\nThe injectivity of \u03b1 is obvious. To prove the surjectivity, take any\nt \u2208 T , such that t2 \u2208 H. Then \u03b3i (t2 ) = 1, hence \u03b3i (t) = \u00b11. It follows\nthat t * x is a real point. Furthermore, \u03b3i (t0 ) = 1 and \u03b3i (t1 ) = \u03b3i (t).\nHence t * H = t1 * H and \u03b1(T0\u03c3 * x) = t mod T \u2229 H.\n\u0003\nLet I denote a subset of {1, . . . , r} and let OI \u2282 X be the corresponding G-orbit.

Consider the quadratic form\n2\n2\nF (z) = z12 + . . . + zp2 \u2212 zp+1\n\u2212 . . . \u2212 zp+q\n, q \u2265 p > 0, p + q > 2.\n\nThe corresponding orthogonal group G = SOF acts on X = Pm as a\nsubgroup of SLm+1 (C), where m = p + q \u2212 1. Under this action, X is a\ntwo-orbit G-variety. The closed G-orbit is given by the equation F = 0.\nAgain, X is a strict wonderful variety of rank 1. Let \u03bc : X \u2192 X and\n\u03c3 : G \u2192 G be the involutive mappings defined by complex conjugation.\nThen \u03bc is a \u03c3-equivariant real structure on X. Note that \u03c3 defines a\nsplit real form of G only for q = p or q = p + 1. The real part RX\nis the real projective space RPm , on which G\u03c30 acts with three orbits:\nF > 0, F < 0 and F = 0.\nRemark 5.20. Starting with a real semisimple symmetric space, A.\nBorel and L. Ji considered the wonderful completion of the complexified\nhomogeneous space. In this special setting, the completion is defined\nover R in a natural way. For the description of real group orbits on the\nset of its real points see [BJ], chapters 5 - 7.\nAppendix A. Spherical varieties: invariants and local\nstructure\nA.1. Luna-Vust invariants of spherical homogeneous spaces.\nWe recollect the definition of the combinatorial invariants attached to\na given spherical G-variety X; see [LV].\nLet C(X) denote the function field of X. Then the natural left action\nof G on X yields a G-module structure on C(X). The weight lattice\n\n\fON THE CANONICAL REAL STRUCTURE ON WONDERFUL VARIETIES 15\n\n\u039b+ (X) is the set of B-weights of the B-eigenfunctions of C(X). Since\nX is spherical, the \u03c7-weight space of C(X) is of dimension 1 for every\n\u03c7 \u2208 \u039b+ (X).\nLet V(X) be the set of G-invariant discrete Q-valued valuations of\nC(X). Consider the mapping\n\u03c1 : V(X) \u2192 Hom(\u039b+ (X), Q),\n\nv 7\u2192 (\u03c7 7\u2192 v(f\u03c7 )).\n\nwhere f\u03c7 is a B-eigenfunction of C(X) of weight \u03c7. The map \u03c1 is\ninjective, hence one may regard V(X) in Hom(\u039b+ (X), Q). Further, this\ncone is convex and simplicial. The cone V(X) is called the valuation\ncone of X; see for instance [Br1].\nDefine the set of colors D(X) of X as the set of B-stable, but not\nG-stable prime divisors of X. This is a finite set equipped with two\nmaps, namely, D 7\u2192 \u03c1(vD ) and D 7\u2192 GD with vD (resp. GD ) being the\nvaluation defined by (resp. the stabilizer in G of) the color D.\nThe Luna-Vust invariants of X are given by the triple \u039b+ (X), V(X),\nD(X). For two spherical G-varieties X and X \u2032 , the equality D(X) =\nD(X \u2032) means that there exists a bijection \u03b9 : D(X) \u2192 D(X \u2032 ), such\nthat GD = G\u03b9(D) and \u03c1(vD ) = \u03c1(v\u03b9(D) ).\nTheorem 1.21 ([Lo]). Let H and H \u2032 be spherical subgroups of G. If H\nand H \u2032 have the same Luna-Vust invariants then they are G-conjugate.\nA.2. Local structure. We recall the so-called Local Structure Theorem with special emphasis on the case of wonderful varieties.\nLet G denote a connected reductive algebraic group. Fix a Borel\nsubgroup B of G and a maximal torus T \u2282 B of G.\nFirst, consider any normal and irreducible G-variety X and let Y be\na complete G-orbit of X. Let y \u2208 X be fixed by the Borel subgroup\nB \u2212 of G opposite to B and containing T . Let P denote the parabolic\nsubgroup of G opposite to the stabilizer Gy and containing T . Then\nL = P \u2229 Gy is a Levi subgroup of P , so that P = L * P u , where P u\nis the unipotent radical of P . Theorem 1.4 in [BLV] asserts that there\nexists an affine L-variety Z, such that y \u2208 Z and the natural map\nP u \u00d7 Z \u2192 P u * Z is an isomorphism.\nSuppose now that X is spherical and denote the set of colors of X\nby D(X); see Appendix A.1. Further, if Y is the unique closed G-orbit\nin X then P u Z is the affine set X \\ \u222aD(X) D and Z is a spherical Lvariety. In the case of wonderful varieties Theorem 1.4 in [BLV] can be\nformulated as follows; see [Lu1], Sect. 1.1, 1.2, and [Br1], Sect. 2.2 - 2.4.\nTheorem 1.22. Assume X is a wonderful G-variety. There exists an\naffine L-subvariety Z of X containing y such that\n\n\f16\n\nD. AKHIEZER AND S. CUPIT-FOUTOU\n\n(i) P u \u00d7 Z \u2192 X \\ \u222aD(X) D : (p, z) 7\u2192 p.z is an isomorphism.\n(ii) The derived group of L acts trivially on Z and Z intersects each\nG-orbit of X in one single T -orbit.\n(iii) The variety Z is the affine space of dimension equal to the rank\nr of X Moreover, Z is acted on linearly by T and the corresponding r\ncharacters of T are linearly independent.\nNote that (ii) is a consequence of the configuration of the G-orbit\nclosures in a wonderful variety. To obtain (iii), remark that Z is smooth\nsince so is X and thereafter apply (ii) together with Luna Slice Theorem.\nLet us now recollect how the slice Z is constructed in the case of strict\nwonderful varieties. One may consult [BLV] for a general treatment.\nLet\n\u03c6 : X \u2192 P(V )\nbe an embedding of X within the projectivization of a finite dimensional G-module V . Thanks to [P], we can take V to be simple. Then y\nregarded in P(V ) can be written as [v \u2212 ] with v \u2212 being a B \u2212 -eigenvector\nof V (unique up to a scalar). Since L is reductive, there exists an Lmodule submodule E \u2282 V such that\nV = Tv\u2212 G * v \u2212 \u2295 E,\nwhere Tv\u2212 G * v \u2212 stands for the tangent space of the orbit G * v \u2212 at the\npoint v \u2212 . Let \u03b7 be the linear form on V such that \u03b7(v \u2212 ) = 1 and \u03b7 is\na B-eigenvector. Let P(Cv \u2212 \u2295 E)\u03b7 be the open set of P(V ) on which \u03b7\ndoes not vanish. Then\n\u0001\nZ = \u03c6\u22121 P(Cv \u2212 \u2295 E)\u03b7 .\nReferences\n\n[A]\n\nD. Akhiezer, Spherical Stein manifolds and the Weyl involution, Ann.
