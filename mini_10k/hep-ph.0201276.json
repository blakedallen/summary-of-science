Beyond\n2001, we aim to determine directly and precisely the gluon polarization, as well as the\npolarizations of the u, \u016b, d and d \u0304 quarks in the proton by measuring in addition longitudinal\nand double spin asymmetries. Furthermore, we aim to measure for the first time the quark\ntransversity distributions. These measurements will improve substantially the knowledge\nand understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the past decade, the inclusive spin asymmetries A1(2) and structure functions g1(2) of the\nnucleon have been measured in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) experiments at CERN [1, 2],\nSLAC [3] and DESY [4]. The data lead one to conclude that only a small fraction of the nucleon\nspin is carried by quark spins. The gluon polarization is determined indirectly from next-toleading order QCD analyses of the scale dependence of the data, and is found to be relatively\nsmall to within large uncertainties [2]. Semi-inclusive measurements [5, 6] demonstrate that\nthe polarization of the valence u quark is positive and that the polarization of the valence\nd quark is negative. The data do not resolve the flavor composition of quark spin densities\nin the sea. Only under the assumption of SU(2) flavor/isospin symmetry of the light sea is\nthe polarization of the sea quarks/anti-quarks determined, and found consistent with zero to\nwithin large experimental uncertainties.\nThe largely open questions of which fraction of the nucleon spin originates from gluon\npolarization and which fraction results from sea-quark polarization will be addressed in the\npresent generation of spin experiments, including STAR at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider\n(RHIC).\nFor this purpose, RHIC will accelerate and collide intense beams (L = 8 \u00d7 1031 \u2013 2 \u00d7\n1032 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) of highly polarized (70%) protons, to projected integrated luminosities of 320\n\u221a\n(800) pb\u22121 at s =200 (500) GeV over the upcoming years [7].\nSTAR (Solenoid Tracker At RHIC) will measure the cross-section asymmetries in collisions\nwith either beam or both beams polarized in longitudinal (L) and tranverse (T ) directions.\n\n1\n\n\fThese so-called single and double spin asymmetries can be denoted by:\nAL,T =\n\n1\n(R++ + R\u2212\u2212 ) \u2212 (R+\u2212 + R\u2212+ )\n1 R\u2212 \u2212 R+\n*\n, ALL,LT,T T =\n*\n,\nP R\u2212 + R+\nP1 P2 (R++ + R\u2212\u2212 ) + (R+\u2212 + R\u2212+ )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the symbols P denote the respective beam polarizations, the symbols R denote the observed number of events normalized to the luminosity of the beam crossing, and the subscripts\n(+) and (\u2212) denote the spin directions with respect to the L, T axes. These measurements\nthus require knowledge of the relative luminosities for (+) versus (\u2212), and for (++) and (\u2212\u2212)\nversus (+\u2212) and (\u2212+) collisions, in addition to knowledge of the absolute beam polarizations.\nThe asymmetries give insight into the nucleon spin structure. Specifically, STAR will\nstudy:\n1. the gluon polarization from the measurements of ALL (i) in inclusive high pT (prompt)\nphoton production p~p\n~ \u2192 \u03b3 + X, (ii) in jet(s) production p~p~ \u2192 jet(s) + X, (iii) from the\nprompt photon in coincidence with jet production p~p\n~ \u2192 \u03b3 + jet + X, and (iv) possibly\n+\n\u2212\nfrom heavy quark production p~p~ \u2192 e + e + X,\n2. the flavor decomposition of the quark spin densities in the nucleon sea from measurements of AL in W production, ~pp \u2192 W + X \u2192 e + X,\n3. the quark transversity distributions from AT T (i) in di-jet production ~pp~ \u2192 di \u2212 jet + X,\nand (ii) in Z 0 production p~p~ \u2192 Z 0 \u2192 e+ + e\u2212 + X,\nin addition to higher twist effects in forward, inclusive \u03c0 0 production [8, 9] and transfer of the\nbeam polarization into the final state, as examined in reference [10] for \u039b production.\nAfter a short overview of the STAR detector systems crucial to the spin measurements,\nthe goal of this year's spin program is described in some detail, followed by a discussion of\nfuture measurements of the gluon polarization and the flavor decomposition of the quark spin\ndensities in the nucleon sea.\n\n2\n\nSTAR detector\n\nThe STAR detector design facilitates the identification and measurement of jets, electrons,\nphotons, and neutral pions.\nIts key component is a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [11] with full azimuthal coverage,\nplaced inside a uniform solenoidal 0.5 T magnetic field. The TPC thus provides tracking for\ncharged particles with pseudorapidities |\u03b7| < 1.5, and is well suited for the reconstruction of\nhadronic jets.\nPhotons and electrons are identified using a lead-scintillator Electromagnetic Calorimeter\n\u221a\n(EMC) with preshower layers, and measured to an energy resolution \u2206E/E \u2243 0.02+0.16/ E.\nThe construction and integration of the EMC in STAR is proceeding in stages. The modules\n2\n\n\finstalled to date (2001) cover 0 < \u03b7 < 1 and \u2206\u03c6 = 4\u03c0/5. Future additions will extend the\ncoverage to \u22121 < \u03b7 < 2 for the full range in azimuth. Each calorimeter module is equipped\nwith a Shower Maximum Detector (SMD) at a depth of about 5 radiation lengths, which\nprovides the high spatial resolution in the shower profile needed to resolve pairs of nearby\nphotons characterizing \u03c0 0 decay.\nThe last detector subsystem discussed here is the Forward Pion Detector (FPD). The\nFPD consists of one prototype module of the EMC with its associated SMD, and three similarly shaped Pb-glass detectors positioned around the beampipe at a distance of 750 cm from\nthe interaction point. Its primary purpose is the measurement of the transverse single spin\nasymmetries in inclusive \u03c0 0 production.\nFurther detail on these and other STAR detector subsystems is provided in reference\n[12, 13].\n\n3\n\nSingle transverse spin asymmetries from p~ + p \u2192 \u03c0 0 + X\n\nThe E704 collaboration at FNAL has measured [14] the single transverse spin asymmetries\n\u221a\nfor the production of leading charged and neutral pions up to large Feynman xF \u2243 2E\u03c0 / s,\n\u221a\n0.0 < xF < 0.8, and small transverse momenta 0.5 < pT < 2.0 GeV in pp collisions at s =\n20 GeV. The asymmetries are found to be large and are described by models [8, 9] of higher\n\u221a\ntwist effects, which predict that the asymmetries persist at RHIC energies s = 200 GeV.\nThe STAR collaboration aims to measure the single transverse asymmetry for neutral\npions using the FPD, described above, for 0.2 < xF < 0.6 and 1 < pT < 4 GeV during\nthis year's spin running [13]. The SMD of the FPD allows the reconstruction of the opening\nangle \u03c6\u03b31 \u03b32 between the decay photons, as well as a crude partition of the energy of the\n2\nphoton pair measured in the FPD prototype EMC module. The invariant mass Minv\n=\n2E\u03b31 E\u03b32 (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6\u03b31 \u03b32 ) thus reconstructed is shown in Figure 3 (left side).\nThe raw trigger rate from the FPD for the nominal luminosity of 5 \u00d7 1030 cm\u22122 s\u22121 is\nestimated from PYTHIA [15] simulations to be about 10 Hz for an energy threshold of 26 GeV.\nFigure 3 (right side) shows the projected data for 50% beam polarization from one week of\nrunning with regular data taking conditions. The continuous (dashed) line shows the model [9]\nasymmetry for neutral (charged) pions. Although the asymmetries for charged pions are\nexpected to be even larger than the asymmetry for neutral pions, the observable asymmetry\nwith the FPD is largest for \u03c0 0 since \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 cannot be distinguished and A(\u03c0 + ) \u2243 \u2212A(\u03c0 \u2212 ).\nThe measurement of the single transverse spin asymmetry in \u03c0 0 production is the main goal\n\u221a\nof this year's STAR spin physics program. The measurement will be the first at s = 200 GeV,\nand will prove STAR's ability to measure spin asymmetries in the RHIC environment. If the\nasymmetry is confirmed to be large, the p~p \u2192 \u03c0 0 + X process may provide an experimental\nmethod to in-situ determine the beam polarization vector at the STAR interaction region [13].\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: (Left) GEANT simulation of the di-photon invariant mass distribution recon\u221a\nstructed with the STAR EMC in pp collisions at s = 200 GeV simulated13 with PYTHIA;\n\u221a\n(Right) The single transverse asymmetry AN for p~p \u2192 \u03c0 + X at s = 200 GeV as a function of the pion energy at a fixed transverse momentum of 1.5 GeV. The lines are theoretical\npredictions for neutral pion (continuous line) and charged pions (dashed lines). The expected\nstatistical precision of the 2001 STAR measurements with the Forward neutral Pion Detector\nare indicated by the data points13 .\n\n4\n\nGluon polarization from p~ + ~p \u2192 \u03b3+ jet +X\n\nPrompt photon production has been the classical tool to determine the unpolarized gluon\ndistribution for moderate and large values of x. At leading order, the photon production\nin pp collisions is dominated by the gluon Compton process q + g \u2192 \u03b3 + q. PYTHIA-based\nsimulations [15,16] show that only about 10% of the production originates from other processes,\npredominantly from the annihilation q + q\u0304 \u2192 \u03b3 + g. Restricting ourselves to the Compton\nprocess, the double longitudinal spin asymmetry ALL can be written at leading order as:\nALL \u2243\n\n\u2206G(xg , Q2 )\n\u00d7 Ap1 (xq , Q2 ) \u00d7 \u00e2Compton\n,\nLL\nG(xg , Q2 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the proton asymmetry Ap1 is known from inclusive DIS [1\u20134] and the partonic asymmetry\n\u00e2Compton\ncan be calculated in perturbative QCD. The QCD scale Q2 is on the order of the\nLL\n2\npT for the prompt photon, and the fraction xq (xg ) of the hadron momentum carried by the\nquark (gluon) can be reconstructed on an event-by-event basis when the photon and the jet\n\n4\n\n\fare detected in coincidence,\nxrecon\n= min(x1 , x2 ),\ng\n\nxrecon\n= max(x1 , x2 ),\nq\n\npT,\u03b3\nx1(2) = \u221a [exp (\u00b1\u03b7\u03b3 ) + exp (\u00b1\u03b7jet )] ,\ns\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b7\u03b3 and \u03b7jet denote the observed photon and jet pseudorapidities, pT,\u03b3 is the observed\ntransverse momentum of the photon, and the jet energy needs not be determined. This\n> 0.2 [16]. The measurement of ALL thus forms a direct\nreconstruction works well for xrecon\nq\ndetermination of \u2206G(x)/G(x). To estimate the precision of the future STAR measurement,\n\nFigure 2: The estimated sensitivity of the future STAR measurements of \u2206G(x) at an average\nQ2 of 100 GeV2 from the p~p~ \u2192 \u03b3 + jet + X channel for three parametrizations of \u2206G(x), as\noutlined in the text.\nthree parametrizations from reference [17] (GS-A, GS-B, and GS-C) of the largely unknown\ngluon distribution \u2206G(x) were used. At the initial scale Q20 = 4 GeV2 , their integrals \u2206G =\nR1\n0 \u2206G(x)dx evaluate to \u2206G(GS \u2212 A) = 1.7, \u2206G(GS \u2212 B) = 1.6, and \u2206G(GS \u2212 C) = 1.0.\nThe continuous lines in Figure 2 show the distributions evolved to Q2 = 100 GeV 2 .\nThe data points show the values of \u2206G reconstructed with Eq.

The measurement for\n\u221a\ntwo values of s is essential to cover a relatively wide region in xg , 0.01 < xg < 0.3. The\nslight underestimation of the model values of \u2206G results mostly from (i) the neglect of the\nannihilation contribution to the observed asymmetry ALL in Eq. (2), and (ii) a small sample of\n5\n\n\fanalyzed events with incorrectly reconstructed kinematics (xrecon\n6= xq and xrecon\n6= xg ), and\nq\ng\nthis may be corrected for by simulation [16]. Backgrounds, predominantly high pT fragmentation photons and photons from \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 0 decays, potentially dilute ALL . These backgrounds\nwill be suppressed by requiring a large radius for the isolation cone, and by identifying and\nrejecting pairs of decayRphotons with the SMD.\nThe integral \u2206G = 01 \u2206G(x) dx from the STAR measurements of ALL in ~pp~ \u2192 \u03b3 +jet+X\nis expected to be determined to a precision better than \u00b10.5. The knowledge of \u2206G may be\nfurther improved by combining this result with the results from less favorable channels and\nfrom other experiments.\n\n5\n\nSingle spin asymmetries in W production\n\nSTAR aims to decompose the quark spin densities in the nucleon sea by measuring the parity\nviolating single spin asymmetries for W production in p~ + p \u2192 W + X \u2192 e + X collisions at\n\u221a\ns = 500 GeV. At these energies, the W is produced predominantly through q q\u0304 annihilation\n- a valence-sea process in pp collisions - which makes the W an ideal probe.\n2 [18]:\nThe leading order W production asymmetries read for Q2 = MW\n+\n\nAW\n=\nL\n\n \u0304 2 ) \u2212 \u2206d(x\n \u0304 1 )u(x2 )\n\u2206d(x1 )\u016b(x2 ) \u2212 \u2206\u016b(x1 )d(x2 )\n\u2206u(x1 )d(x\nW\u2212\n \u0304 2 ) + d(x\n \u0304 1 )u(x2 ) , AL = d(x1 )\u016b(x2 ) + \u016b(x1 )d(x2 ) ,\nu(x1 )d(x\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the transverse momentum of the W is neglected and the W production process is\nassumed to be dominated by the annihilation of light quarks [19]. The fractions x1,2 of the\nhadron momentum carried by the struck quarks are related to the rapidity yW of the W\naccording to [20]\nMW\nx1 = \u221a exp (yW )\ns\n\nand\n\nMW\nx2 = \u221a exp (\u2212yW ),\ns\n\n(6)\n\nwhich thus needs to be reconstructed. The rapidity yW can be determined from the observed\nrapidity ye of the electron [21].\nThe top part of Figure 3 shows evaluations of the asymmetry based on the leading order\npolarized [22] and unpolarized [23] parton distributions. The continuous lines correspond to\nthe 'Standard Scenario' [22] of flavor symmetric light sea quark and antiquark distributions\nat the initial QCD scale.\nThe dashed lines correspond to the 'Valence Scenario' [22], in which SU (3) flavor symmetry\nis broken and the light sea densities are different (\u2206\u016b 6= \u2206d \u0304 6= \u2206s\u0304). The bottom part of\nFigure 3 compares the 'Standard Scenario' asymmetries with their intuitive, approximate\nforms [18]:\n\u2212\n+\n \u0304\n\u2243 \u2212 \u2206\u016b\nfor yW \u2264 \u22121,\n\u2243 \u2212 \u2206d \u0304d , AW\nAW\nL\nL\n\u016b ,\n(7)\n\u2212\n+\n\u2206d\n\u2206u\nW\nW\n\u2243\nAL\nfor yW \u2265\n1.\n\u2243\nAL\nu ,\nd ,\n6\n\n\f+ (left) and for W \u2212 (right) for a flavor symmetric distriFigure 3: Top half: AW\nL (yW ) for W\nbution of the light sea quark and antiquark polarizations (continuous line) and for a flavor\nasymmetric distribution (dashed line).

These projections are based on an integrated luminosity of 800 pb\u22121\nand account for preliminary data selections used to reliably relate the rapidities ye and yW . Potentially large hadronic backgrounds will be rejected with the Preshower and SMD subsystems\nof the EMC, whereas backgrounds from heavy quark and Z 0 leptonic decays are estimated\nto be manageably small. The measurements \u2013 while demanding \u2013 are thus expected to verify\nvarious symmetry scenarios and to aid the flavor decomposition of quark spin densities in the\nnucleon sea.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nThe STAR collaboration is about to start its spin physics measurements, and aims in its\ninitial running period of about five weeks for the measurement of the single transverse spin\nasymmetry in the production of neutral pions, using a recently installed and successfully\ncommissioned Forward neutral Pion Detector.\nDuring future running periods the aim of the spin measurements is to determine the\npolarization \u2206G of gluons in the nucleon, the flavor composition of the nucleon sea, and\nthe yet unexplored quark transversity distributions. STAR's unique ability to measure \u2206G\nthrough coincident detection of direct photons and jets from p~p\n~ collisions is expected to yield\na particularly competitive measurement of \u2206G over a wide kinematic range, 0.01 < xg < 0.3.\nFurthermore, the high beam energies at RHIC open a window to study the flavor composition\nof quarks in the nucleon through weak-interactions.\nRHIC starts colliding polarized protons in December 2001, thereby opening a new era in\nhigh energy spin physics - stay tuned!\n\nReferences\n[1] EMC, J.
