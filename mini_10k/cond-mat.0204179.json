There is strong spatial heterogeneity and individual sites display a\ndynamics ranging from near power law (\u03b2 = 0) to near exponential (\u03b2 = 1) while the global\ndynamics, given by a spatial average, remains stretched exponential. These results can be\nreproduced quantitatively with a one-dimensional coupled-map lattice and thus appear to be\nsystem independent. In this model, local stretched exponential dynamics is achieved without\nfrozen disorder and is a fundamental property of the coupled system. The heterogeneity of the\nexperimental system can be reproduced by introducing quenched disorder in the model. This\nsuggests that the stretched exponential dynamics can arise as a purely chaotic phenomenon.\n\nStretched exponential relaxation is almost ubiquitous in complex systems. It is found\nin glasses [1], spin glasses [2], polymers, high-dimensional cellular automata [3], random networks [4] coupled chaotic oscillators [5,6] and others [7]. For many of these problems, however,\nthe microscopic origin of this dynamics is difficult to establish both experimentally and theoretically. Understanding the underlying causes for stretched exponential relaxation remains,\ntherefore, a central goal in the study of the dynamics of complex systems [8\u201310], as witnessed\nby the flurry of theoretical, experimental and numerical results that have appeared on the\nsubject in the last few years [10\u201313].\nIn the last 20 years, many physical processes have been understood in terms of nonlinear\ndynamics and chaos, these concepts often going beyond the reach of standard equilibrium\nstatistical physics.\nHere,\u0003 we present experimental results showing a stretched exponential\n\u0002\ndynamics, exp \u2212(t/\u03c40 )\u03b2 , in a simple one-dimensional chaotic system comprised of a chain\nof chaotic electronic oscillators. In particular, we find that in the vicinity of the transition to\nspatiotemporal chaos, individual site dynamics shows this behavior over six orders of magnitude and that the \u03b2's associated with individual site range from 0.8 (nearly exponential) to 0.2\n(\u2217 ) E-mail: hunt@helios.phy.ohiou.edu\n(\u2217\u2217 ) E-mail:normand.mousseau@umontreal.ca\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Schematic diagram of a single diode-resonator and its coupling to its nearest neighbors in a\none-dimensional arrangement.\n\n(nearly power law) depending on the activity of the site. Furthermore, the global dynamics\nof the networks also shows a stretched-exponential dynamics with a \u03b2 having an intermediate\nvalue. These results can be reproduced using a 1D coupled-map model which also displays\na transition to spatio-temporal chaos. Close to that transition, the model shows uniform\nstretched exponential dynamics. We recover the heterogeneous dynamics of the experiment\nby introducing quenched disorder in the model. These results suggest that the stretched\nexponential dynamics can arise as a purely chaotic phenomenon.\nWe study the behavior of a one-dimensional chain of 256 coupled diode-resonators with\nperiodic-boundary conditions. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the basic blocks\nforming the one-dimensional array. A diode resonator is comprised of the series combination\nof an inductor (30 mHy) and a rectifier type pn junction diode (1N1004) and is driven by a\nsinusoidal source (100 kHz); it follows the period-doubling route to chaos as the ac drive is\nincreased [16]. There are fairly large differences in the individual resonators; for example, the\ndrive voltage for a given feature, such as the period-3 fixed point, varies by as much as 20\n%. Diffusive coupling between the elements is provided by resistors as shown and periodic\nboundary conditions are used. This one-dimensional setup has been previously studied with\nunidirectional coupling [17] and under the conditions of stochastic resonance [18].\nAs the drive voltage is increased, the coupled system shows a kink-forming route to spatiotemporal chaos. At low drive the elements period double nearly synchronously with no\nor very little current in the coupling resistors. Increasing the drive, the system reaches a\ntwo-band chaotic state in which all elements are in the same band. Following this, coarse\ngrained period-2 phase kinks (two-band structures in which neighboring elements are in opposite bands) begin to appear [17]. A kink tends to make the system less chaotic since there\n\n\fE. R. Hunt, P. M. Gade and Normand Mousseau: Stretched exponential dynamics 3\n\nis now appreciable power dissipated in the coupling resistors and the available phase space\nis reduced. With increasing drive voltage, the number of kinks increases until a regular or a\nnear regular kink lattice is formed with a lattice constant function of the coupling resistors.\nAt this point each element displays two-band chaos with the phase alternating around the\nchain. Further increasing the drive, the two chaotic bands merge into one, in an example\nof an attractor-merging crisis in a high-dimensional spatiotemporal system [19]. The critical\ndrive voltage Vc is where the two attractors just touch. Well above Vc the system displays\nfull spatiotemporal chaos. Just above Vc regions of the system still spend long periods of\ntime trapped in the old two-band attractor before switching to the new single attractor for\na time and then back again. In a single chaotic oscillator the intermittent switching between\ntwo attractors is an example of crisis-induced intermittency and the trap time displays exponentially distributed switching times [19]. As discussed below, crisis-induced intermittency\nalso exists in coupled system but the trap time at that point is now dominated by stretched\nexponentials.\nFigure 2 shows a 4096-cycle time series for the 256 elements. The two phases of the\ntwo-band attractor are represented as black and white, and only every other time step is\ndisplayed. Note the creation, annihilation and diffusion of the boundaries of the two-band\nattractor. With the coupling resistors used, 150 k\u03a9, the coarse-grained spatial periodicity of\nthe lattice is about 4 sites.\nIn Fig. 3, we plot the distribution of trap times, i.e., how long a site remains in the\ntwo-band phase. This distribution is measured on a single site over 109 cycles, or 10 hours\nof experimental measurements. This distribution is very well approximated by a stretched\nexponential with an exponent \u03b2 = 0.40 \u00b1 0.05 and \u03c40 = 27 \u00b1 10 drive cycles. In glasses\nand other systems, this behavior is associated with relaxation processes. These processes are\ndescribed by a time autocorrelation function averaged over the entire system. As shown in the\ninset of Fig. 3, our system also shows a global stretched-exponential dynamics; the flattening\nof the auto-correlation function at longer time is due to the limited statistics [20].\nWe can address directly the question of heterogeneities in our setup. Figure 4 shows the\nactivity associated with each site. Activity is defined as the number of times a site changes\nstate normalized by the number of time steps. The activity is a measure of the local dynamics\nof the sites: very active sites typically show a dynamics close to that of the chaotic regime\nwhile the slow sites display a trap-time distribution more in line with the frozen regime.\nMostly determined by the value of the local chaotic threshold, the variations in activity are\nessentially uncorrelated spatially as can be seen in Fig. 4. Spatial correlations, measured as\na two-point function on the lattice, show an exponential decay, exp(\u2212r/r0 ), with r0 \u2243 6 sites,\nin the intermittent phase, close to the basic spatial periodicity just below crisis.\nThe level of activity for a given site is also reflected in the overall dynamics of this site.\nFigure 5 shows the trap-time distribution for three sites with different level of activity. All\nthree sites are consistent with stretched exponential with exponents \u03b2 = 0.8 for the \"hotter\"\nsite, \u03b2 = 0.4 and \u03b2 = 0.3, for the \"cooler\" sites. Faster sites can be equated with an effective\nhigher driving voltage and a dynamics moving towards a pure exponential (\u03b2 = 1); slower\nsites, on the other hand, display stretched exponential with lower exponent, and can even have\na power-law correlation (\u03b2 = 0), depending on the external driving. For a big enough system,\nwe expect to find the whole range of \u03b2 at any driving in this intermittent phase and see the\ndistribution of exponent change with driving, with the value of the global \u03b2 somewhere in\nbetween the two extremes contrary to what was proposed recently by Richert and Richert [15].\nAs is often the case for glasses, where the exponent \u03b2 varies as a function of temperature,\n\u03b2 here changes with the driving voltage. At low external driving, \u03b2 is zero or nearly zero\nand the system is either totally frozen or showing a power-law distribution of trap times. As\n\n\f4\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 Time series of the 256 diodes in the intermittent state, just above Vc . Since the system\ndisplays a fundamental period-two oscillation in time below Vc , we show the state of the diodes at\neven time-steps in a binary representation.\n\nthe driving is increased, \u03b2 also increases relatively smoothly to \u03b2 = 1.0, for the single site\nchosen, and to about 0.5, on average, before the full system become completely chaotic. The\nrelaxation time scale, defined by \u03c40 , follows \u03b2 rather closely, roughly doubling in the driving\nrange of 3 to 3.2. The overall time scale associated with the traps is therefore of the order of\n100 drive cycles, with trap times reaching many times this value during the measurement.\nSurprising results are obtained in the simulation of a simple one-dimensional coupled-map\nlattice. This model follows Kaneko [21] and Johnson et al. [17] and is composed of a chaotic\n\n\fE. R. Hunt, P. M.

The apparent tail at\nlonger time is due to the discrete nature of the measurement and could be redressed by more statistics.\nInset: Time auto-correlation function averaged over all 256 sites for a run of of 2048 timesteps of 64\ndrive cycles each.

The model, like the experimental\nset-up, shows an attractor-merging crisis with crisis-induced intermittency in the vicinity of\nthe transition to spatiotemporal chaos. Below the transition each site is in a coarse-grained\nperiod-two state. The system also shows spatial periodicity with alternating groups of sites\nin a coarse-grade period-2 as described above for the experimental set-up. The size of these\ngroups depends on \u03b1. We choose \u03b1 = 0.25 for a spatial wavelength of 4 sites, similar to\nthe experiment. Just above the crisis the system gets trapped in the two-band attractor in\nlocal regions for a while before going chaotic again. While for an uncoupled system the times\nbetween switches have a long-time exponential distribution [19], Fig. 6 shows that the traptime distribution for this model follows a stretched exponential with \u03b2 = 0.70 \u00b1 0.05 over the\nfull distribution, with all sites displaying the same distribution. The stretched exponential is\ntherefore not caused by disorder but is a fundamental property of the coupled system.

As in the experiment, the global dynamics is also\nwell-described by a stretched exponential even though the various sites show a broad range\nin their relaxation dynamics. A fuller discussion of the simulation results will be presented\nelsewhere [22].\nIn conclusion, we have found stretched exponential dynamics in a one-dimensional chain\nof chaotic diode resonators near the transition to spatiotemporal chaos. While individual\nsites display a wide range of \u03b2's, the global time autocorrelation function also shows this\nbehavior [23]. As can be seen in Fig. 2 traps can be continuously created and distroyed. They\nare stabilized by their spatial extension, which biases the trap-time distribution towards longer\ntimes. Based on a simple one-dimensional coupled map model, we show that this behavior is\nnot related to disorder. These results indicate that the stretched exponential dynamics can\nbe purely chaotic in origin.\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nWe acknowledge partial support from the NSF under grant number DMR-9805848 and the\nNatural and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NM) and the ONR (ERH).

This raises the possibility that the\nlocal dynamics in glasses could be more complex that what is described in the traditional\nheterogeneous model.\n\n\f"}
