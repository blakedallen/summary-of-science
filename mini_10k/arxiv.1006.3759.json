Observations have shown that today there\nare massive black holes in the center of nearly all galaxies [3\u20135]. When galaxies collide their central black holes\nsink to the center of the merged galaxy and begin to orbit\none another, losing energy and angular momentum in the\nform of gravitational waves [6]. Gravitational wave (GW)\nemission rapidly erases any initial eccentricity [7, 8], so it\nhas long been thought that eccentricity could be ignored\nwhen modeling the signals from massive black hole binaries [9]. More recently, however, it has been shown\nthat the mechanisms that may harden the binary to the\npoint where the gravitational wave emission takes over\nall tend to drive up the eccentricity [10\u201319]. The question then is whether significant eccentricity survives until\nthe final year or so before merger. Figure 1 shows the\neccentricity evolution as a function of orbital frequency\nfor systems that enter the gravitational wave dominated\nevolution stage at frequency fgw with eccentricities of\negw = 0.95 and egw = 0.5. The tracks are computed using the leading-order Peters and Matthews [8] evolution\nequations. These equations predict that once the eccentricity drops below e \u223c 0.3, it decays as e \u223c f \u221219/18 - in\nother words, roughly a factor of ten in eccentricity is lost\nper decade of frequency. The rate of decay is slower for\nsystems with very high eccentricities, allowing them to\nmaintain significant eccentricity for longer. For typical\nLISA black hole binaries, the GW decay time drops below the Hubble time when the systems are 3 to 5 decades\nin frequency from the LISA band, so unless egw is very\nclose to unity, a purely GW driven orbital evolution results in nearly circular orbits in the LISA band. On the\nother hand, if the hardening mechanism (e.g. gas dy-\n\nnamics or stellar scattering) continues to dominate the\ndynamics until the system is close to the LISA band,\nthen interesting eccentricities can be maintained.

Moreover, as shown in Figure\n8 of Ref. [20], the distribution of eccentricities depends\non the component masses in a particular way, so measuring this distribution can help constrain black hole merger\nmodels. While the distribution of component masses and\nspins as a function of luminosity distance will likely play\na more important role in studying galaxy - black hole\nco-evolution [21\u201323], the eccentricity distribution may\nprovide useful additional constraints. These considerations suggest that it is desirable to include the effects\nof eccentricity in the gravitational waveform, bringing\nthe total number of parameters needed to describe a\nblack hole inspiral to seventeen: the redshifted black hole\n\n\f2\nmasses (m1 , m2 ), the distance to the source (DL ), the initial radial eccentricity and semi-major axis (e0 , a0 ), the\ndimensionless spin parameters for the two black holes\n(\u03c71 , \u03c72 ), the source sky location (cos \u03b8, \u03c6), the initial\norientation of the angular momentum and spin vectors\n(cos \u03b8L , \u03c6L ) , (cos \u03b8S1 , \u03c6S1 ) , (cos \u03b8S2 , \u03c6S2 ), and two initial\nphase parameters (n0 , \u03c60 ). Failing to include the eccentricity in the waveform model will lead to a loss of signalto-noise [24, 25] and to biases in the recovery of the other\nparameters [26, 27].\nThe instantaneous gravitational waveforms describing\nthe inspiral of a black hole binary with arbitrary spins,\nmasses, and orbital eccentricity were calculated by Kidder [28] to second post-Newtonian order (2 PN, or order\nv 4 /c4 in the relative velocity), and extended to 2.5 PN\norder by Faye, Blanchet and Buonanno [29, 30]. Maj\u00e1r\nand Vas\u00fath [31] later introduced a convenient framework for expressing the waveforms in a form amenable\nto producing detection templates. Together with a solution to the conservative equations of motion, adiabatically advanced with the angular momentum and energy\ndissipation equations [28], we can build the time dependent gravitational waveforms for a general binary black\nhole system with the full seventeen parameters necessary to describe the system. LISA observations of binary\nblack hole inspirals can be compared to these waveforms\nto produce posterior distributions for the model parameters. These observations will allow us to constrain galaxy\nmerger scenarios [21\u201323], and allow us to test General\nRelativity in the dynamical strong field regime [32]. Left\nunaccounted for, the effects of orbital eccentricity may be\nmistaken for a departure from General Relativity (in particular, even small eccentricities that produce negligible\npower in higher harmonics can lead to easily detectable\nchanges in the phase evolution of the signal).\nBlack hole binary systems in eccentric orbits may also\nbe detected by ground based gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave\nObservatory (LIGO) and Virgo [33]. Some models even\npredict that inspiral signals may enter the LIGO band\nwith e > 0.9 and that eccentric templates will be necessary to detect such sources [34]. Current LIGO data\nanalysis uses circular templates and may need to be generalized to include eccentricity.\nWe have previously described a method for combining the instantaneous gravitational waveforms for eccentric binary systems with a post-Keplerian solution to the\nequations of motion that is adiabatically advanced using the the orbit-averaged dissipation and spin precession\nequations to build ready-to-use gravitational waveforms\nfor the general case of a spinning black hole binary system\nin an eccentric orbit [35]. Here we present the results of a\nparameter estimation study for spinning eccentric binary\nblack hole sources for the LISA mission. This is an extension of the Lang and Hughes LISA parameter estimation\nstudy of spinning binary black holes in circular orbits [36]\nand is the first to include the full seventeen parameters\nthat describe a general black hole binary inspiral.\n\nII.\n\nWAVEFORM MODEL\n\nThe equations needed to numerically calculate time dependent gravitational waveforms for binary black hole\nsystems have been computed to 2.5PN order in the amplitude and phase [28\u201331]. The resulting system of equations could be numerically evolved to produce waveforms\nfor our study, but the computational cost of resolving the\nmotion of the black holes on the orbital timescale is too\nlarge for the parameter estimation study we wish to perform. Taking advantage of the separation of time scales\nin the waveform model we have developed an efficient\nwaveform generator at 1.5 PN order in the amplitude\nand phase [35]. These waveforms include the effects of\nperiastron precession, the precession of the orbital plane\ndue to spin-orbit coupling, and higher harmonics from\nthe higher order mass and current multipole moments.\nOur waveform model does not include the effects of spinspin coupling which enter at 2PN order. In future work\nwe plan to extend the waveform model and our parameter\nestimation study to higher Post-Newtonian order.\nThe fastest time scale for the system is the orbital time\nscale, which to leading order is given by Kepler's law:\n3\n\n1\n\nTorb \u223c 2\u03c0a 2 M \u2212 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere M = m1 + m2 is the total mass of the system and\na is the semi-major axis. Periastron advance enters at\n1 PN order, with a fractional advance per orbit of k =\n3M 2 \u03bc2 /L2 , where \u03bcp= m1 m2 /M is the reduced mass of\nthe system, L \u2243 \u03bc aM (1 \u2212 e2 ) is the orbital angular\nmomentum and e is the eccentricity of the orbit. The\nratio of the periastron precession timescale to the orbital\ntimescale is given by\n2\u03c0\na\nTperi\n=\n\u2243\n.\nTorb\nk\nM\n\n(2)\n\nThe orbital angular momentum L precesses with angular velocity \u03c9 prec = Seff /r3 [35], where\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3m2\n3m1\nSeff = 2 1 +\nS1 + 2 1 +\nS2\n(3)\n4m1\n4m2\nThe effective spin vector has magnitude Seff \u223c M 2 since\nthe magnitude of the individual spins is given by Si =\n\u03c7i m2i where the dimensionless spin parameter 0 \u2264 \u03c7i \u2264\n1.

Orbit averaged expression for these decay\nrates can be found in Ref. [35]. The effects of spin-orbit\ninduced precession of the orbital plane and the overall\nsweep up in frequency and amplitude as the system inspirals over the course of a year are apparent in Figure 2\nfor a system with e0 = 0.3 and other source parameters\ngiven in Table II for Source 1.\nAt times well before the merger of the system M/a is\nsmall and we find that\nTdecay > Tprec > Tperi > Torb .\n\n(7)\n\nWe take advantage of this separation of the relevant\ntime scales to make our waveform calculations more efficient. Since the decay and precession timescales are much\nlonger than the orbital timescale we can start with a solution to the orbital equations of motion that neglects\ndissipation. This allows us to use Nyquist sampling of\njust a couple of samples per orbit for the quantities that\ndepend on the dissipation and precession equations and\nsaves considerable computational cost. Considering only\ntimes early in the evolution of the system we have a clean\nseparation of time scales and the different processes can\nbe treated differently in the calculations. This simplifies\nthe problem by allowing an adiabatic treatment where\nthe dissipation is assumed to be small over the course\n\nof an orbit and the eccentricity and semi-major axis are\ntreated as constant while calculating an individual orbit.\nThe approximations involved in exploiting the separation of timescales introduce small errors in the waveforms. The largest of these comes from using the orbitaveraged spin precession equations, which neglects small\nperiodic changes in the spin orientations that occur on\nthe orbital timescale, but these changes are effectively\n2.5 PN order contributions to the higher harmonics. The\naveraging also introduces small errors in the long term\nsecular evolution that scale as the ratio of the averaging time scale (in our case the orbital timescale) and the\ntimescale of the terms being averaged (such as the spin\nprecession timescale). These errors are multiplicative,\nand so represent higher PN order terms that can be discarded at 1.5 PN order.\nAs the system approaches merger the various time\nscales become comparable and our waveform model\nbreaks down. We adopt the termination condition\n2\u03c0M forb = 0.01, which corresponds to an expansion parameter M/a \u2248 0.05. Denoting the time when this condition is met as ts , and the orbital frequency at this time\nas fs , we taper the waveform smoothly to zero by multiplying the waveform with a half-Hann filter:\n(\n1,\nif t \u2264 tH\nw(t) =\n(8)\n2\ncos (\u03c0(t \u2212 tH )fs /3) , if t > tH\nwith tH = ts \u2212 3/(2fs ).\nOur termination condition is conservative in terms of\nthe signal to noise ratio (SNR) LISA will be able to extract from this type of source. Most of the SNR comes\nfrom times near merger, so the extension of the validity\nof the waveform closer to merger results in a big increase\nin SNR. Our study here is thus a pessimistic estimate\nof how well LISA will be able to determine the various\nsource parameters. In the case of the radial eccentricity\nparameter however, the circularization of the waveform\ntoward merger means that most of the eccentricity information is encoded at times well before merger. While\nincreased SNR would improve the determination of the\nother source parameters, we find that the eccentricity is\nnot highly correlated with the other parameters (see Figure 13). Our choice for when to truncate the waveform\nthus should not have much of an effect on our study of\nhow well LISA will be able to determine the eccentricity\nof black hole binary systems.\nWe have tested our waveform generator in various limits against other codes. In the circular limit, and with\ndissipation turned off, we found precise agreement with\nthe 1.5 PN limit of the spinning black hole code developed\nby Cornish, Hughes, Lang and Nissanke that is described\nin Ref. [37]. We do not expect, and nor do we find, precise\nagreement when dissipation is included. This is because\nour eccentric waveform generator evolves the semi-major\naxis, while the circular orbit code evolves the orbital frequency, which leads to numerical differences at 2 PN order. In the 0-PN limit (hence no spin effects and no\n\n\f4\nhigher harmonics) we find precise agreement with the\nPeters and Matthews waveforms [7].\n\nIII.\n\nLISA RESPONSE\n\nWe simulate the LISA response to a gravitational wave\nsignal plus instrument noise and confusion noise due to\ngalactic binary sources of gravitational waves. We adopt\nthe standard ecliptic coordinate system with origin at the\nbarycenter. The individual data streams from the six\nLISA phase meters can be combined to cancel out the\nlaser phase noise and form Time Delay Interferometry\n(TDI) variables [38]. The Michelson style TDI variables\n{X, Y, Z} can be used to construct three noise orthogonal\ndata streams that are similar to the {A, E, T } variables\ndescribed in Ref. [39].\nProcessing the gravitational waveform through the\nLISA response function imparts additional amplitude\nand frequency modulations on the one year timescale of\nthe LISA orbits. These effects can be seen in Figure 3,\nwhich shows the A-channel response to the Barycenter\nsignal shown previously in Figure 2.\n2e-20\n\n1.5e-20\n\n1e-20\n\nA(t)\n\n5e-21\n\n0\n\n-5e-21\n\n-1e-20\n\n-1.5e-20\n\n-2e-20\n0\n\n5e+06\n\n1e+07\n\n1.5e+07\nt (sec)\n\n2e+07\n\n2.5e+07\n\n3e+07\n\nFIG. 3: The A(t) channel response to the spinning binary\nblack hole system shown in Figure 2. The amplitude modulation is due to a combination of the antenna pattern sweeping\naround as LISA orbits the Sun, and the spin induced precession of the orbital plane. The overall gravitational wave\namplitude grows as the system spirals in and nears merger.\n\nThe one-sided noise spectral density of the detector in\nthe A and E channels is given by [41]:\n\nto a synthetic galaxy [42], followed by the removal of resolvable systems [44].

We take a Bayesian approach and use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\ntechnique to compute the posterior distribution function\np(~x|s) describing the model parameters ~x that we infer\nfrom data s. Our results establish how well the various\nsource parameters will be able to be determined by the\nLISA mission, including the orbital eccentricity.\nThe use of MCMC techniques in gravitational wave\ndata analysis is now a familiar technique for parameter\nestimation in gravitational wave astronomy [45\u201350]. The\nresult of a well constructed MCMC is a set of samples\nfrom the posterior distribution. The number of samples\nfrom a particular region of parameter space is proportional to the posterior weight contained in that region.\nThe uncertainty in each parameter is given by quantiles\nof the marginalized posterior distribution (e.g. the halfwidth of the 90th percentile equates to a 2-\u03c3 error if the\ndistributions are Gaussian).\nBy Bayes theorem, the posterior distribution is given\nby the product of the prior distribution p(x) and\nRlikelihood p(s|x), normalized by the evidence p(s) =\np(x)p(x|s) dx. For Gaussian noise, the likelihood of the\ndata s having being generated by a gravitational wave\nsignal h(x) is given by\n1\n\np(s|x) = Ce\u2212 2 (s\u2212h(x)|s\u2212h(x)) ,\n\n(11)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere C is a normalization constant that does not depend\non the signal or the template. Here we have used the\nnoise weighted inner product\nZ \u221e \u2217\na (f )b(f ) + a(f )b\u2217 (f )\ndf ,\n(12)\n(a|b) = 2\nSn (f )\n0\n\nwhere u = 2\u03c0f /L, Snp (f ) is the position noise and Sna (f )\nis acceleration noise, and we have taken the limit of symmetric noise in the detector. The confusion noise due\nto gravitational wave sources in the galaxy has been estimated by direct simulation of the LISA response [43]\n\nwhere Sn (f ) is the one-sided noise spectral density. The\nprior probability density for x reflects our knowledge of\nthe source parameter, however ill-formed, before we analyze the data. For example, we assume a uniform prior\nfor angular parameters such as the sky location and the\ninitial orientation of the angular momentum vector, such\n\nSinst (f ) =\n\n4\n[(2 + cos u)Snp (f )\n3\n+4 1 + cos u + cos2 u\n\n\u0015\n\u0001 Sna (f )\n,\n(2\u03c0f )4\n\n\f5\nthat the cosine of the co-latitude is uniformly distributed\nin the range [\u22121 : 1] and the azimuth is uniformly distributed in the range [0 : 2\u03c0].\nThe primary mode of the posterior distribution yields\nthe best fit values for the source parameters, according\nto the current data and our prior knowledge. In many\ninstances the posterior distribution is multi-modal, and\nthe quantiles used to estimate the parameter uncertainties may cover disjoint regions in parameter space. Even\nwhen the bulk of the posterior weight lies in a single, contiguous region, the posterior distribution may not be well\napproximated by a Gaussian distribution. Nonetheless,\na Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution\noften provides a reasonable estimate of the parameter estimation errors, which can be efficiently computed using\nthe Fisher information matrix \u0393ij , which measures the\nexpectation value of the curvature of the posterior distribution about the mode:\n\u0393ij = \u2212h\u2202i \u2202j ln p(x|s)i|mode .\n\n(13)\n\nWe employ a parallel tempered [52] MetropolisHastings [53, 54] MCMC routine to explore the PDF.\nThe Markov chain starts at parameter values x and transitions to y with probability\n\nH = min\n\n\u0014\n\np(y)p(s|y)q(x|y)\n,1\np(x)p(s|x)q(y|x)\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nHere q(x|y) is the proposal distribution, which is the\nfunction that generates proposals for moves from x to\ny. The performance of an MCMC algorithm is quite\nsensitive to the choice of proposal distribution, and care\nmust be taken to ensure that the chains do not get stuck\non local maxima of the PDF. We employed several techniques to ensure rapid exploration of the full parameter\nspace: local coordinate transformations to uncouple the\nparameters; moves that exploit symmetries of the likelihood surface to encourage jumps between local maxima;\nand parallel tempering to encourage wide exploration of\nthe posterior [50, 51, 56]. The number of iterations spent\nat each parameter value is proportional to the posterior\ndensity, and histograms of the parameters visited by the\nchain provide an estimate of the posterior distribution.\nWe have found that drawing from a variety of proposal\ndistributions provides a set of jump proposals that tend\nto produce an MCMC that efficiently maps out the desired PDF and provides accurate parameter uncertainties\neven for very large search spaces. Our parameter estimation study thus uses several proposal distributions, including parallel tempering and Fisher matrix proposals.\nIn this high dimensional parameter space we found it advantageous to use the Fisher matrix approximation to the\nposterior to propose jumps along single eigen-directions\nas part of the mixture of jump proposals.\n\nV.\n\nPARAMETER ESTIMATION WITH LISA\n\nWe can use our time dependent gravitational waveforms [35] and established MCMC techniques to study\nhow well LISA will be able to measure the full set of\nseventeen parameters necessary to describe a spinning\nbinary black hole system in an eccentric orbit. We are\nespecially interested in determining when eccentric orbits\ncan be distinguished from circular orbits.\nWe chose to study signals in their final year prior to\nmerger, with an observation time that extends just beyond the merger. In order to choose initial parameter\nvalues for a system that will merge in one year, we need\nto calculate an initial semi-major axis based on the lifetime estimate for a system with some given initial radial\neccentricity. We use the leading order, 0 PN expression\nfor a0 [8]\na0 = 4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bcM 2\nTc\n5\n\n\u0013 41 \u0012\n157 2 5799977 4\n1+\ne +\ne\n172 0 7336832 0\n\u0013\n1888175763 6\n,\n(15)\ne\n+\n2523870208 0\n\nas an initial guess, and apply a bisection routine to the\nfull numerical orbital evolution to find the value of a0\nthat yields a merger time Tc of one year.\nTABLE I: Parameter ranges for our study of spinning black\nhole binary systems in eccentric orbits.\nParameter Minimum Maximum\nm1\n105 M\u2299\n107 M\u2299\nm2\n105 M\u2299\n107 M\u2299\nDL\n1 Gpc\n100 Gpc\ne0\n0\n1\na0\n20 M\n1000 M\n\u03c71\n0\n1\n\u03c72\n0\n1\ncos \u03b8\n-1\n1\ncos \u03b8L\n-1\n1\ncos \u03b8S1\n-1\n1\ncos \u03b8S2\n-1\n1\n\u03c6\n0\n2\u03c0\n\u03c6L\n0\n2\u03c0\n\u03c6S1\n0\n2\u03c0\n\u03c6S2\n0\n2\u03c0\nn0\n0\n2\u03c0\n\u03c60\n0\n2\u03c0\n\nWe use parameter ranges consistent with typical LISA\nsources, given in Table I. The masses are given in terms\nof the mass of the Sun, M\u2299 = 1.9891 \u00d7 1030 kg, and\nthe luminosity distance DL is given in units of Gigaparsecs. The dimensionless spin parameters \u03c71 and \u03c72\n\n\f6\ncombine with the black hole masses to give the magnitudes of the spins, Si = \u03c7i m2i . There are initial orientation parameters for the orbital angular momentum\nvector L \u2192 (cos \u03b8L , \u03c6L ), as well as the spin vectors\nSi \u2192 (cos \u03b8Si , \u03c6Si ). The final two parameters, n0 and \u03c60 ,\nare initial phases related to the mean motion and orbital\nphase. In the circular limit these parameters are degenerate, but for eccentric orbits we have to specify the initial\nperiastron position. In the present study we have ignored\nthe possibility that gas dynamics may partially aligned\nthe spins with the orbital angular momentum [57], which\nwould restrict the prior ranges and reduce the degree of\norbital precession. The impact of this partial alignment\non parameter estimation has been considered for circular orbits [58], and it would be interesting to extend this\nstudy to include eccentricity.\nHere we study several representative cases to establish the parameter recovery errors and to study correlations between the parameters. The high dimension of\nthe parameter space makes it difficult to perform a comprehensive study - if we were to choose just two values\nof each parameter we would need to perform 217 \u223c 105\nparameter estimation studies. Each MCMC run involves\n\u223c 100, 000 iterations with \u223c 8 parallel chains, and takes\nabout a week to run on a single 2.66 GHz Intel processor,\nso we are limited in the number of examples we can consider. We perform MCMC parameter estimation studies\nof several representative examples, varying the mass ratio, sky location, distance, eccentricity, and dimensionless\nspin parameters. We only looked at a few initial spin and\norbital orientations since we do not expect these to have\na significant effect on the results - unless the initial orientations are very special the system will explore a wide\nrange of orientations during the orbital evolution. To be\nable to explore the parameter space more widely would\ntake a faster code. One possibility is to use the Fisher information matrix approximation to the posterior, which\nis many orders of magnitude faster than a full MCMC\nstudy. In preparation for such a study we compare the\nFisher matrix approximation to the MCMC derived posterior distributions and find that the approximation is\nfairly reliable so long as the initial eccentricity exceeds\ne0 \u223c 0.01.\nOur first study focuses on determining when the eccentricity one year before merger is distinguishable from\nzero. We studied two systems that only differed in sky\nlocation (and hence in SNR), and considered initial eccentricities in the range e0 \u2208 [0.001, 0.2], see Table II for\na list of the other source parameters. Marginalized posterior distributions for e0 are shown in Figure 4 for Source\n1, and Figure 5 for Source 2. We see that the error in\nthe measured value of e0 gets smaller as e0 gets larger,\nbut the dependence on e0 is fairly weak, and never larger\nthan \u2206e0 \u223c 0.001. Our criteria for deciding if the eccentricity is distinguishable from zero is to see if their is any\nweight in the posterior distribution at e0 = 0 (this test is\nmotivated by the Savage-Dicke density ratio estimate for\nthe model evidence [43]). For Source 1 we see that the ex-\n\nTABLE II: Injected parameter values for two sets of sources\nstudied with a range of values for e0 .

For Source 2, which has higher SNR due to a\nmore favorable sky location, the e0 = 0.002 case is clearly\ndistinguishable from circular. The Fisher matrix approximation to the posterior distribution is computed at the\nmaximum a posteriori probability (MAP) value of the\nparameters, and is found to work well for eccentricities\ne0 > 0.05, but breaks down for small eccentricities. The\nMCMC derived posterior distributions are much flatter\nthan a Gaussian distribution, and we attribute the failure of our Fisher matrix estimates to only including the\nleading order, quadratic curvature terms in the Fisher\nmatrix calculation.\nThis study suggests that LISA observations of eccentric black hole binary systems will be able to measure\nthe eccentricity of the system and distinguish eccentric\nsystems from circular systems to parts in a thousand. A\nsimilar study was performed by Porter and Sesana [27] for\nnon-spinning eccentric binary black hole systems. Their\nresults suggest that LISA will be able to measure the\neccentricity to parts in 10\u22124 for such sources.\nWe find that the other source parameters are also measured quite well, as illustrated in Figure 6 and Figure 7.\nMarginalized posterior distributions are shown for the\nchirp mass Mc = (m1 m2 )3/5 /(m1 + m2 )1/5 and reduced\nmass \u03bc = m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ), the distance to the source,\nthe initial radial eccentricity, and the two sky location\nparameters. We compare the Fisher matrix approximation to the marginalized posterior distributions computed\nfrom the MCMC runs and find excellent agreement for all\nthe parameters (except for the eccentricity in Figure 6).\n\n\f7\ne0\n\ne0\nln(\u03bc)\n\nln(Mc)\n\n14.0116\n\n0.099\n\n0.1\n\n0.101\n\n0.009\n\ne0\n\n0.01\n\n0.011\n\n14.0116\n\n14.0117\n\n14.0117\n\n13.4095\n\n13.4098\n\nln(DL/Gpc)\n\n0.012\n\n13.4101\ne0\n\ne0\n\n1.82707\n\n1.84553\n\n1.86399\n\n1.88245\n\n0.000146989 0.00139639 0.00264579 0.00389519\n\u03c6\n\ncos(\u03b8)\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n0\n\n0.001\n\n0.002\n\n0.003\n\n0.004\n0.192008\n\nFIG. 4: Marginalized posterior distribution for the initial radial eccentricity for sources with the same parameter values\nexcept for different initial eccentricities and semi-major axes.\nThe boxed histograms are derived from the Markov chains,\nwhile the solid lines are the Fisher matrix predictions computed at the MAP values of the parameters (which are pushed\noff the true values by the instrument noise).

We find that LISA can determine\nthe eccentricity of the system one year before merger to\nparts in a thousand. This result depends only weakly on\nthe initial value of the eccentricity, indicating that LISA\nwill be able to distinguish between eccentric\nand circular\n\u0001\norbits at the same level e0 \u223c 10\u22123 .\nThe construction of the gravitational waveforms for\nspinning binary black hole systems in eccentric orbits to\n1.5 PN order in [35] establishes the framework for the extension of this work to higher post-Newtonian order. Binary black hole waveforms that include eccentricity will\nbe necessary for several of the LISA science goals including constraining galaxy merger scenarios and testing\ngeneral relativity in the strong field regime near supermassive black holes.\n\nThis work builds the foundation for further studies\nincluding a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space including source sky location, distance, spins,\nmasses, and mass ratios. For sources with initial radial\neccentricity greater than e0 \u223c 0.02 the Fisher matrix is\na good approximation to the posterior distribution. The\nvery large parameter space could be studied quickly using the Fisher approximation, although it is not as useful\nfor the low initial eccentricity cases.\nThe equations of motion and instantaneous gravitational waveforms have been calculated to the next postNewtonian order and these pieces can be included in a\nfuture parameter estimation study. The 2 PN effects include the spin-spin coupling of the two black holes and\nthus corrections to the precession and evolution of the\nsystem.\nThese waveforms can be also be used to study how well\n\n\f10\nthe Advanced LIGO-Virgo network and proposed Einstein Telescope will be able to measure eccentricity and\nwhat level of bias could be expected from using circular\ntemplates for parameter estimation.\nVII.\n\nto Alberto Sesana and Edward Porter for extensive and\ninformative discussion of the mechanisms responsible for\nproducing black hole binaries with eccentric orbits.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by NASA grants\nNNX07AJ61G and NNX10AH15G.
