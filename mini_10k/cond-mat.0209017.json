Electric polarization phenomena in insulating systems have long been\ndescribed in mean field theory by the (static) Clausius-Mossotti or (dynamic) LorentzLorenz polarizabilities. It is here shown, in the strong coupling regime, that a\nthermodynamic phase instability exists in these models.

Precisely relating \u03b5 to \u03b1 is a statistical thermodynamic problem of\nconsiderable complexity. In the lowest order mean field theory approximation, the\nproblem is solved by the Clausius-Mossotti equation[13-16]\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b5\u22121\n4\u03c0\u03b1\n=\n,\n(2)\n3v\n\u03b5+2\nwhere v is the volume per molecule. Equivalently, the mean field Clausius-Mossotti\nelectric susceptibility is then\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(\u03b1/v)\n\u03c7=\n.\n(3)\n1 \u2212 (4\u03c0\u03b1/3v)\nNote that the stability of Clausius-Mossotti mean field theory requires the inequality\nfor the static polarizability\n4\u03c0\u03b1 < 3v\n\n(stable normal phase).\n\n(4)\n\nWhen the above inequality is violated, the normal phase becomes unstable and a new\nstable phase appears. Our purpose is to show that this new stable phase is nothing but\nthe superradiant phase implicit in superradiant[17-26] Dicke-Preparata models. The\n\u00a7 To whom correspondence should be addressed (a.widom@neu.edu)\n\n\fMean Field Theory of Thermal Superradiance\n\n2\n\nderivation of the superradiant phase diagram is considerably simplified. To see what\nis involved, one may consider the response functions \u03b1, \u03c7 and \u03b5 generalized to finite\nfrequency \u03c9.\nWhen the response functionspare contemplated at finite frequency, for example in\n\u03b5(\u03c9) , the Clausius-Mossotti Eqs.(1), (2) and (3)\nthe index of refraction n(\u03c9) =\nbecome the Lorentz-Lorenz equations[27-30]. These have a surprising feature regarding\nfrequency shifts. For example, suppose that a single atom with atomic number Z has a\nstrong resonance at frequency \u03c9\u221e , i.e. with m as the electron mass,\n\u0012 2\u0013\n1\nZe\n,\n(5)\n\u03b1(\u03c9) \u2248\n2\nm \u03c9\u221e \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u2212 2i\u03b3\u03c9\nEqs.(3) and (5) then imply\n\u0012 2\u0013\nZe\n1\n\u03c7(\u03c9) \u2248\n,\n2\n2\nvm \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 2i\u03b3\u03c9\n\nwith a \"renormalized\" resonant frequency \u03c90 given by\n\u0012\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u001b\n4\u03c0Ze2\n4\u03c0\u03b1\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c90 = \u03c9\u221e \u2212\n= \u03c9\u221e 1 \u2212\n,\n3vm\n3v\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b1(\u03c9 = 0) is the static polarizability. The macroscopic Lamb frequency shift\n\u2206\u03c9 = \u03c9\u221e \u2212 \u03c90 is certainly worthy of note. It is due to the coherent collective oscillation\nof a large number of molecular dipole moments.\nElectric dipolar motions in (say) a single atom move at a Bohr frequency \u03c9\u221e\ndetermined by the energy difference between two states |ii and |f i connected by a\ndipole matrix element hf | p |ii =\n6 0, i.e. ~\u03c9\u221e = (\u01ebf \u2212 \u01ebi ). In a condensed matter\nsample of similar atoms, the dipolar motions in one atom radiate an electromagnetic\nfield which can drive a neighboring atomic dipole into oscillation. The motion can\nbecome collective. In the mean field theory of Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz,\nthe driving collective macroscopic electric field \u0112 is related to the dipole moment per\nunit volume P via \u0112 = \u2212(4\u03c0/3)P. The mean electric field phase locks the oscillations\nof many atoms. The collective motions of the large number of dipoles yields the\nmacroscopic Lamb shift frequency renormalization \u03c9\u221e \u2192 \u03c90 in accordance with Eq.(7).\nMean field \u0112 theory thereby implies a new collective Bohr frequency which from a\nquantum mechanical viewpoint arises from more closely spaced macroscopic energy\nlevels ~\u03c90 = (Ef \u2212 Ei ) < ~\u03c9\u221e = (\u01ebf \u2212 \u01ebi ).\nAt the critical temperature Tc for stability, we have from the static polarizability\nstability Eq.(4) the condition\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\u03c0\u03b1(Tc )\n= v (critical point),\n(8)\n3\n\nwhere \u03b1c = \u03b1(Tc ). From the dynamical Eq.(7) viewpoint, the renormalized frequency is\nlowered to zero at the critical temperature limT \u2192Tc + {\u03c90 (T )} = 0 which again leads to\nEq.(8).\n\n\f3\n\nMean Field Theory of Thermal Superradiance\n\nIn order to compute \u03b1(T ) one needs a model Hamiltonian Hmol for a single molecule.\nIn the presence of an external electric field F one may then compute the single molecule\npartition function\n\u0001\n\u03a6(F, T ) = \u2212kB T ln T r e\u2212(Hmol \u2212p*F)/kB T .\n(9)\n\nwhere p is the electric dipole operator of the molecule.

The difference\nbetween the two level model and the four level model is merely a shift in the phase\nboundary. The existence of the superradiant phase is robust with respect to changes in\nthe detailed model structure.\nWe have developed a very simple algorithm for finding the regions in the (T, v)\nplane for which the superradiant phase exists. Linear magnetic materials can be either\nparamagnetic or diamagnetic. Linear electrical systems can only occur in nature as\nparaelectrics. Diaelectric systems can be ruled out[33]. It is the absence of diaelectricity\nwhich accounts for the reliability of the algorithm. The computation of the phase\ndiagram requires (i) a reliable computation of the single molecule polarizability, and (ii)\nthe dielectric constant of the bulk material.

The fluctuation\ncorrections to Clausius-Mossotti mean field theory[34-39], (i.e. the precise g(v, T )\nfunction) may be computed systematically via perturbation theory. The corrections\nare merely quantitative. Qualitatively, the superradiant phase is shifted but left intact.\n\u0012\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n\nW.D.
