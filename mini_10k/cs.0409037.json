Its related\narea of research \u2013 Information Systems Development \u2013 is dominated by process thinking. The\neffects of process thinking on the success rate of IT projects are unknown. To investigate these\neffects, this section elaborates on the setup of research.\n\n1.1\n\nResearch Background\n\nAnnual expenditures on Information Technology by organizations in the United States are\nestimated at $250 billion. According to the Standish Group (2003) 51% of all IT projects are\nchallenged, meaning that those projects are either not finished on time or fail to remain within\ntheir budget constraints. In practice these conditions often occur simultaneously. The average\nbudget overrun is estimated at 43%, while the deadline is likely to be exceeded by 82% of the\noriginal project's allocated time. Another 15% of the projects are entirely abandoned, which\nleaves an overall success rate of 34% for IT projects. Although these figures may not be\ndirectly applicable to the situation in the Netherlands, they do give an impression of the still\n\n\f2\n\nM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\neminent struggle of IT specialists to implement technology at organizations in a predictable and\nmanageable way.\nThe development of organizational management in the last decade could be a clue to the low\nsuccess rate of IT projects. During the 1990's, many organizations restructured their\ndepartments when they applied a process perspective to their business. This process\nperspective superseded their earlier functional one (Silvestro and Westley 2002: 217). Inspired\nby the success of Japanese car manufacturers in the 1970's and 80's 1, Harrington (1991)\ndevised a strategy for Total Quality Management (TQM) 2. Others described an even more\ndisruptive intervention known as Business Process Reengineering (BPR) (Scott Morton 1991;\nDavenport 1993; Hammer and Champy 1993). Both of these movements share a focus on\nbusiness processes as a key indicator for the ability of an organization to deliver its products or\nservices in a timely and efficient manner (Hammer 1996: 83). Such a fundamental shift in the\nperspective of management likely has large implications for existing IT infrastructures, and\ncomplicates the development of new Information Systems.\nAnother clue to the failure of Information Technology within organizations is the social impact\nof such technology. Even as early as 1988 \u2013 just before the emergence of BPR within\nmanagement journals \u2013 it was suggested that IT projects are not likely to fail due to technical\ncomplications, but seem to suffer from contradicting interests of the various stakeholders\n(Riesewijk and Warmerdam 1988). Perhaps the complicated nature of IT implementations are\nnot merely the result of the aforementioned restructuring of organizations. Both the TQM and\nBPR movement conceive organizations using a perspective that can be labeled as 'process\nthinking'. Its supportive technique is Business Process Modeling, which is dominant for IT\nconsultants trying to define the organizational context of Information Technology (Butler,\nBahrami et al. 2000). The area of research that studies the relationship between Information\nTechnology and the organization as context is called Information Systems Development. The\ndominance of process thinking within this scientific discipline could be another cause of the high\nfailure rates of IT projects.\n\n1.2\n\nResearch Questions\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, process thinking is claimed to have at least two major\nimplications on the success rate of IT projects. Firstly, the restructuring of organizations by\nfocusing on business processes \u2013 instead of tasks and functions \u2013 has consequences for existing\nand future Information Systems from a structural point of view. Secondly, it influences the\nconsideration of the social impact of Information Systems during the development and\nimplementation of such systems. The aim of this paper is to investigate these claims, and to\ngive directions on how to overcome their resulting limitations. Therefore, this paper deals with\nthe following questions:\n1. Does the impact of business processes on the structure of organizations require a\ndifferent practice within the area of Information Systems Development?\n2. Is the conception of organization present in process thinking adequate to define the\ncontext of Information Systems?\n3. What are the limitations of process thinking within Information Systems Development\nand how can they be overcome?\nThe first question encompasses both the emergence and definition of process thinking. The\napplication of this perspective to organizations gives insight into the structural aspect of\nInformation Technology within organizations. Secondly, the consideration of the socialorganizational context of such technology is dependent on the applied view of organizations \u2013\n\n1\nJaffee (2001: 132) gives a historical overview of the production model of Japanese car manufacturers,\nwho adapted and improved on the traditional Ford assembly line.\n2\nIn the Netherlands the 'Model Nederlandse Kwaliteit' (trans. Dutch Quality Model) was a notable set of\nTQM guidelines for the Dutch industry (Smit 2003). Nowadays, this model is known as the 'INKmanagementmodel' (trans. INK Management Model) (INK 2003). The EFQM Excellence Model is the leading\norganizational framework in Europe, partially based on TQM principles (EFQM 2003).\n\n\fM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\n3\n\nthe conception of organization. Finally, the limitations of process thinking are to be\ninvestigated. Should these limitations exist, this paper will attempt to provide directions in\novercoming them.\n\n1.3\n\nEpistemological Justification of Conducted Research\n\nIn my opinion the study of organizations cannot be defined as an exact science. Organizations\nevolve in the interaction of participants; an evolution that is dependent on the shared\nconvictions and values of its participants. I also reject the idea that a single, universally\nappropriate type of organization exists, or that a single utopian view on organizations can be\napplied to each and every organization in real life. These notions may conflict with my\nbackground in Computer Science, a field that is often regarded as 'hard' science. I do think,\nhowever, that the application of Information Technology within organizations justifies a broader\nperspective. The social scientific movement that resembles my ideas is social constructivism\n(Kroes 1996). This movement rejects the idea of separating knowledge from its social\nbackground, thereby implying that knowledge is subjective (Jones 2002). Social constructivism\nalso states that there is no single objective reality, since reality is constructed by the process of\nreaching a shared universe of discourse between the various participants. Social ontological\nfacts are therefore negotiated, which can be viewed as ontological relativism. One could\ndescribe this relativism as an extreme or radical form of social constructivism.\nMost and for all I apply social constructivism on a meta-theoretical level of social scientific\nresearch. Within the social sciences I observe different schools of thought are separated by\ntheir respective ideology. Each of these schools has its own accepted research methodology and\npractice, which I consider to be a subject of negotiation among the school's participants. In\naddition, I presume these schools to coexist and complement each other in their contribution to\nsocial scientific research in general. This presumption implies a single ontological view on\norganizations is not possible, since each conception of an organization is bound to its respective\nideology. Burrell and Morgan (1979) conducted research on organizational analysis and\nidentified four basic paradigms. Their definition of a paradigm equals my view on schools of\nthought and their ideologies: '[a paradigm is] a term which is intended to emphasize the\ncommonality of perspective which binds the work of a group of theorists together in such a way\nthat they can be usefully regarded as approaching social theory within the bounds of the same\nproblematic' (Burrell and Morgan 1979: 23). A critical difference of this view with the paradigm\ndefinition of Kuhn, is that Kuhn described the historically successive developments of the\nnatural sciences, whereas Burrell and Morgan assume theories in the social sciences to coexist\n(Iivari, Hirschheim et al. 1998: 171-172).\nOn the level of applied research, I do think social constructivism \u2013 which I relate to the\ninterpretive paradigm of Burrell and Morgan \u2013 is an important contribution to the understanding\nof organizations. However, I would like to stress that I do not wish to apply social\nconstructivism in an imperialistic way. I think the real strength of social constructivism is its\nacceptance of different ideologies. Furthermore, since most practitioners in the field of\nInformation Systems are guided by the philosophical assumptions of functionalism (Goles and\nHirschheim 2000), they are not likely to accept an interpretive critique of their practice. To\novercome this ideological difference, I will use an epistemology known as paradigm interplay.\nThis epistemology allows for acknowledging both differences and similarities of the functionalist\nand interpretive paradigms (Goles and Hirschheim 2000: 260), while also bridging ideological\ndifferences between their respective followers. Within the functionalist tradition, I will\nreevaluate the conception of organization using a modernist epistemology; this is known as\npost-modern periodization 3. This conception will be used to discuss the impact of Business\nProcess Reengineering \u2013 an illustrative movement that adheres to process thinking \u2013 on both\n\n3\n\nParker (1992) discusses two distinct positions within postmodernism, which he describes as 'postmodern\nepistemology' and 'post-modern periodization' (the hyphenation is deliberate). While the former movement\ncompletely rejects modernism and realism, the latter simply reapplies modernist approaches to an\nobservable empirical reality. Both agree that new forms of organization are emerging, but differ in their\nontological and epistemological assumptions on how to comprehend this development.\n\n\f4\n\nM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\norganizations and Information Systems Development. Critical identified aspects will be reflected\nfrom an interpretive point of view. A more precise description can be found in the next section.\n\n1.4\n\nOutline of This Paper\n\nThe questions discussed in \u00a71.2 impose the structure of this paper. Respectively chapter 2, 3,\nand 4 address these three questions. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the background of the\nresearch (\u00a71.1), and describes the related research questions (\u00a71.2). The research methodology\nto obtain the answers to these questions is based upon an epistemology of research (\u00a71.3).\nThese answers form the outline of this paper (\u00a71.4).\nChapter 2 illustrates the concept of process thinking and how this concept affects the structure\nof organizations and their IT systems. The emergence of Total Quality Management and\nBusiness Process Reengineering illustrates the context in which process thinking surfaced\n(\u00a72.1). Business Process Reengineering is chosen as an example of how such a perspective can\nbe used and implemented in organizations (\u00a72.2). This implementation has several effects on\nInformation Systems within organizations (\u00a72.3). The conclusion answers the question if the\ncurrent practice of Information Systems Development is sufficient to deal with the identified\neffects on Information Systems (\u00a72.4).\nChapter 3 studies the conception of organization according to process thinking. A paradigmatic\nview of organization provides the necessary broader perspective to investigate this conception\n(\u00a73.1). General Systems Theory serves as a bridge between the paradigmatic theory and the\nconception, because General Systems Theory is widely used within the paradigm to which\nprocess thinking belongs (\u00a73.2). An analysis of Business Process Reengineering illustrates the\nconception of organization according to process thinking (\u00a73.3). The conclusion denominates\nthe deduced conception and elaborates on its conflict with the General Systems Theory (\u00a73.4).\nChapter 4 reflects on the research findings and identifies several limitations of process thinking.\nCritical analysis of Business Process Reengineering is a starting point to obtain these limitations\n(\u00a74.1). Several directions to overcome some of these limitations with respect to Information\nSystems Development are presented (\u00a74.2). The conclusion elaborates their practical use\n(\u00a74.3). Finally, chapter 5 gives the overall conclusion of this research and stresses the\nlimitations of the research conducted.\n\n2\n\nThe Organizational Shift from Tasks to Processes\n\nThe development of organizational management in the early 1990s sheds light on the context of\nprocess thinking as meant in this paper. To illustrate the application of process thinking to the\nrestructuring of organizations, this section deals with the orientation's most extreme movement:\nBusiness Process Reengineering. The reforms initiated by BPR have had several implications on\nthe IT infrastructure of these organizations.\n\n2.1\n\nEmergence of Process Thinking\n\nIn 1990, two articles by Hammer (1990) and Davenport and Short (1990) created quite a stir\nwithin both theory and practice of organizations (Barothy, Peterhans et al. 1995). Earlier on, in\n1984, Scott Morton devised a research program \u2013 The Management in the 1990s Research\nProgram \u2013 to explore the impact of Information Technology on modern organizations (Scott\nMorton 1991: 3). In the same year (1991) of Scott Morton's publication of the program's results,\nKeen published a book with a similar subject. While the latter was rather vague in describing his\norientation \u2013 a team-based collaborative organization (Keen 1991: 108) \u2013 Hammer coined the\nterm Business Process Reengineering (Hammer 1990). Davenport and Short (1990) labeled\ntheir movement Business Process Redesign, which was later superseded by the term Business\nProcess Innovation (Davenport 1993). Although a lot of different names are present, they all\nrepresent a movement that suggests organizations need to radically transform their current\npractice. Only then will they be able to cope with the high demands of the business\nenvironment.\n\n\fM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\n5\n\nBusiness Process Reengineering (BPR) \u2013 which is the label used throughout the remainder of\nthis text \u2013 is complementary to another movement. This movement \u2013 known as Total Quality\nManagement (TQM) (Harrington 1991) or 'kaizen' (Davenport 1993: 312) \u2013 shares the process\nview of organizations with BPR. Instead of considering structure and control \u2013 illustrated by the\nadministrative organization of Simon (1976) \u2013 both the TQM and BPR process orientations focus\non overall performance from a client perspective. Within that context, existing functional\ndivisions are likely to hinder the throughput of products and services, since each hand-off\nbetween departments creates extra delay. In addition, errors are more likely to occur due to\nmiscommunication. The term 'reengineering' should be understood in the context that Michael\nHammer used it in initially. In his famous article of 1990, he used the Ford Motor Company as\nan example for the entire American business world. Beaten by their Japanese competitors in\nquality, price, and time-to-market in the 1970s and 1980s, Ford radically overhauled its\norganization. The company cut many old bureaucratic habits and focused on the overall\nperformance of its processes instead. Hammer used the term reengineering to stress that the\nentire company needed to change radically, and should not settle with minor improvements.\nDavenport analyzed the key differences between TQM and BPR (Malhotra 1998). TQM can also\nbe regarded as a continuous improvement program, since quality management is an ongoing\nprocess. BPR is more concerned with radical change, which is typically linked with the concept\nof innovation. The differences are represented in Table 2-1.\nImprovement (TQM)\nInnovation (BPR)\nLevel of change\nIncremental\nRadical\nStarting point\nExisting process\nClean slate\nFrequency of change\nOne-time/continuous\nOne-time\nTime required\nShort\nLong (at least 2 years)\nParticipation\nBottom-up\nTop-down\nTypical scope\nNarrow, within functions\nBroad, cross-functional\nAssociated risk\nModerate\nHigh\nPrimary Enabler\nStatistical control\nInformation technology\nType of change\nCultural\nCultural/structural\nTable 2-1: Differences between TQM and BPR (adapted from Davenport 1993: 11)\n\nIf the Ford case is taken into account, BPR was originally envisioned as a one-of-a-kind change\nprogram. This is also present in the overview of Davenport. Until the late 1980s Western\nbusiness companies 4 were inefficient at realizing their goals, because they were slow,\nbureaucratic organizations. Many firms used the principle of the division of labor as their\nprimary structural management methodology (Hammer and Champy 1993: 12). Adam Smith,\nwho wrote his famous book 'The Wealth of Nations' in 1776, argued that \u2013 in order to enable\nmass production \u2013 labor should be divided into many specialist tasks. Alfred Sloan applied this\norientation to management, by introducing divisions and hierarchical structures. In practice, this\nmeans that growing organizations require more and more overhead, since the span of control \u2013\nthe amount of people one manager can supervise \u2013 is limited. The increasing distance between\nsenior management and the shop floor hinders communication. The end result for many\ncompanies was that they were unable to timely respond to the changing demands of customers.\nBPR was therefore a radical change program, because it aimed to abandon the dominant\ncommand-and-control system present in many organizations. The favorable type of organization\nwas the 'process organization'.\nNext to business processes \u2013 a concept borrowed from TQM \u2013 and the vision of radical change,\nBPR has another key ingredient. The two most influential names in the BPR movement are\nassociated with Information Technology. Michael Hammer is a former computer science\nprofessor at MIT (Hammer and Champy 1993), while Thomas Davenport was a partner at Ernst\n\n4\n\nNote that both Davenport and Hammer really meant American companies, when they talked about\nWestern businesses. The understanding and implementation of BPR within Europe has been much more\ndiffused (Newell, Swan et al. 1998). The historical overview in this section is based on Hammer and\nChampy (1993), and therefore does not necessarily reflect the European situation.\n\n\f6\n\nM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\n& Young's Center for Information Technology and Strategy in Boston (Davenport 1993). Both\nauthors worked together in a multiclient research program called 'Partnership for Research in\nInformation Systems Management' (PRISM) in 1988 (Davenport 1995). An important occasion of\nthis program and other related programs is the productivity paradox 5. This paradox is an\nobservation about the effect of IT on the productivity of companies in the USA. Despite the\nincreasing investment in computing power from the 1970s and onwards, the productivity \u2013\nespecially of the service sector \u2013 stagnated (Brynjolfsson 1993; Petrovic 1995). Whether this\nparadox was true or not 6, it was a major argument for many practitioners and researchers who\nstressed that IT was applied wrongly to organizations. It comes as no surprise, then, that the\nrole of IT in BPR is eminent.\nAlthough radical change, business processes, and Information Technology remain the key\ningredients of BPR, the meaning and implication of BPR changed over the 1990s. For instance,\nHammer (1996) stressed that the key concept of BPR was no longer the word 'radical', but just\n'business process'. One can argue that improvement and innovation programs are still\nnecessary, even when the organization has left its functional divisional structure behind. In\naddition, the distinction between the TQM and BPR approaches is clear in theory, but the\ndividing line is often blurred in practice (Altinkemer, Chaturvedi et al. 1998:381-2). BPR just\nbecomes part of the management armamentarium. The renewed relationship between TQM and\nBPR is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The quality programs are equal to the concept of continuous\nimprovement, and reengineering is similar to Davenport's notion of innovation. Most of\nDavenport's earlier observations about BPR remain valid, though. BPR is more radical than TQM,\nbecause it is less bound to existing work arrangements. Innovation should not be limited by the\nimplementation of current business processes at first, because this will likely narrow the area of\nstudy too much. BPR is therefore exemplary as an illustration of process thinking. It is a clean\nbreak with organizations of the past, which were dominated by functions, tasks, and structures.\n\nR\nProcess\nPerformance\n\nR\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nTime\nQ = Quality programs\nR = Reengineering\nFigure 2-1: Relationship of TQM and BPR throughout time\n(adapted from Hammer 1996: 83)\n\n5\n\nReferences to this paradox are present explicitly in Scott Morton (1991:v-vii) and Davenport and Short\n(1990: 12). Others simply refer to the required increase of awareness of IT among managers (cf. Keen\n1991).\n6\nFor example, Greenstein (1996) questions if the productivity really stagnated and therefore rejects the\nentire paradox.\n\n\fM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\n2.2\n\n7\n\nThe Implementation of BPR within Organizations\n\nThe previous section discussed the context in which Business Process Reengineering (BPR)\nemerged. The BPR approach has its roots in IT management 7 (Malhotra 1998), and was only\nlater addressed by science. Especially during the period 1990-95 BPR reached a peak in terms of\nmanagement hype (Davenport 1995), while at the end of that period it was just gaining\nmomentum within scientific research (Barothy, Peterhans et al. 1995). Also it was mentioned\nthat BPR has become part of management practice, in addition to approaches such as Total\nQuality Management (TQM). To understand the original envisioning of BPR, the steps involved in\nimplementing BPR as was common during the early 1990s are discussed.\nBarothy called for the foundation of BPR as a scientific research subject. His review of\npublications prior to his article \u2013 including the books from Hammer and Champy and Davenport\n\u2013 leads to the following definition of BPR: ' a complex, top-down driven and planned\n\norganizational change task aiming to achieve radical performance improvements in one or\nseveral cross-functional, inter- or intra-organizational business processes whereby IT is\ndeployed to enable the new business process(es) ' (Barothy, Peterhans et al. 1995: 4). This\n\ndefinition reflects the context in which BPR emerged, as discussed in the previous section. A\nhigh-level approach to implement BPR within organizations is given by Davenport (1993: 25). A\nmore detailed discussion is given by Schwartz, Hwang et al. (1995). The five major steps of the\nBPR methodology are summarized as follows.\n1. Identify processes.\n2. Identify change levers.\n3. Develop process visions.\n4. Understand existing processes.\n5. Design and prototype the new process.\nThe first step is in effect a critical assessment of the organization's strengths and weaknesses.\nThe major business processes are enumerated and their viability is judged. In this phase it is\nnot necessary to know the complete details of each and every business process, since the main\nfocus should be on overall performance and strategic relevance. Next, it is important to identify\nthe potential opportunities \u2013 especially technological and human openings. Likewise, possible\nconstraints have to be considered as well. The third step involves the necessary vision of the\nbusiness processes that are selected for reengineering. Especially performance targets and\nbenchmark results can contribute to the rationale of the change program. If the vision is\nformulated, the present implementation of the business processes should be understood. If\ntested along the objectives, shortcomings and problems can be identified more easily. Finally, a\nbrainstorm session to obtain design alternatives should lead to the selection of a best\nalternative and the subsequent development of a prototype. Implementing this new design\nrequires a proper migration strategy. As is apparent in this approach, BPR is envisioned as a\ntop-down exercise. Barothy's definition emphasizes the importance of IT within a BPR change\nprogram, whereas Davenport is keen to stress the importance of human change levers as well.\nThe role of Information Technology within BPR is eminent: not only is IT a facilitator for BPR\nimplementations, but it is also an enabler of organizational change. Hammer and Champy (1993:\n84) label this as inductive thinking : 'the ability to first recognize a powerful solution and then\nseek the problems it might solve'. New technologies rarely have a direct application, but if a\nfunction is found it will give a striking competitive advantage. Davenport (1993: 200) adds that\nIT can be supportive during BPR change programs as well. This varies from tools to support the\ndesign of new business processes, performance monitoring tools, and collaborative technology\nsuch as e-mail and directory services.\nAfter the business processes are designed and prototyped, they are to be embedded\npermanently within the organization. The necessary change from a functional structure towards\na process-based organizational structure is the greatest challenge. Although some degree of\n\n7\n\nThe two most influential articles of Davenport and Short (1990) and Hammer (1990) were both published\nin management journals. Davenport (1995: 70) stresses that the 'real' creators of reengineering are\nmanagers and other practitioners. Section 2.1 discusses the role of IT.\n\n\f8\n\nM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\nformal structure remains necessary, work is no longer built around specific skills and tasks\n(Davenport 1993: 161). Both Hammer and Champy (1993) and Davenport (1993) introduce the\nconcept of the case worker and the case team. Such a person or team is responsible for an\nentire customer deliverable. This empowerment gives employees the authority to make decisions\nrequired to solve customer issues instantly, without having to wait for management's approval.\nIn addition, role expansion is necessary, because several functions that were split across\ndepartments are now combined within the responsibility of one person or team. Both\nempowerment and role expansion are a direct result of the client orientation of business\nprocesses in BPR (see \u00a72.2), because they shorten processing time. The assumption of BPR is\nthat the problems of handoff between departments are hereby eliminated.\n\n2.3\n\nEffect on Information Systems within Organizations\n\nThe use of Information Technology (IT) in organizations is typically linked with the concept of\nInformation Systems . Without further defining this concept here, its mission as proposed by\nMcNurlin and Sprague (1989: 12) will shed some light on the role of IT within organizations: 'To\nimprove the performance of people in organizations through the use of information technology'.\nApparently the use of IT within organizations should support a certain goal or purpose, at least\nfrom a management perspective 8. This implies that software and hardware are adapted in a\nwider context \u2013 the organization or a subunit \u2013 and their use is \u2013 or should be \u2013 wellconsidered.\nEspecially during the 1980s, the awareness of the strategic value of Information Systems\nincreased (McNurlin and Sprague 1989: 58-86). Daft (1998) identifies several types of\nInformation Systems. Their application has shifted from 'efficient machines' towards 'strategic\narms' in the last couple of decades. Transaction Processing Systems are an illustration of a\nsystem with a low level of complexity. Such a system could be an airline reservation system, or\nan ordering system. These types of system are typically associated with lower levels of\nmanagement, and therefore do not have much impact on the organization's strategy.\nManagement Information Systems and Decision Support Systems form a different category,\nsince they are more coupled with the decision-making within organizations. Such systems have\nan increased level of complexity, as opposed to efficient machines. The final type of Information\nSystem can be labeled as strategic arms, and this coincides with the observation of McNurlin\nand Sprague (1989) about the increased strategic value of Information Systems in the 1980s.\nDaft (1998) places Executive-management Information Systems, Networks, and Electronic Data\nInterchange in this category. The development of Information Systems is visualized in Figure\n2-2.\n\n8\nBarbara McNurlin and Ralph Sprague had a management perspective when they discussed the use of IT\nwithin organizations. This perspective \u2013 which is also present in the work of Richard Daft (1998) \u2013 is\nmaintained throughout this paragraph.\n\n\fM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\n9\n\nStrategic arms\n\nSenior\n\nLevel of\nmanagement\n\nCapital\nequipment\n\nDirection of IS\ndevelopment\n\nEfficient\nmachine\n\nFirst line\nLow\n\nSystems complexity\n\nHigh\n\nFigure 2-2: Development of IS within organizations (adapted from Daft 1998: 280)\n\nThe application of the process orientation to organizations (see \u00a72.1 for an elaboration) has\nseveral implications on existing Information Systems, but also on the development of new\nsystems. The most fundamental characteristic of business processes with respect to Information\nSystems is that they are cross-functional. In the past, Information Systems were bound to a\nfunctional division or a subunit of the organization. If these borders are surpassed, the existing\nsystems have to be integrated 9. This is known as Enterprise Application Integration\n(Johannesson and Perjons 2001: 165). While this is largely a technical exercise \u2013 concerned\nwith techniques such as middleware \u2013 it has great impact on the management of these systems.\nAs can be seen in Daft's development of Information Systems, the complexity of these systems\nincreases dramatically. Melling (1994: 496) observes that Transaction Processing Systems\n(categorized by Daft as 'efficient machines') are typically task oriented. This suggests that the\nhighest level of systems complexity deals with cross-functional business processes, since they\nare the highest abstraction level of the production or service provision of the organization.\nThe alignment of Information Technology and business strategy is a topic that can be related\ndirectly to Daft's notion of the development of Information Systems within organizations. If the\nstrategy of the organization is leading, and management realizes the strategic value of\nInformation Technology, the IT Architecture can be seen as the realization of the business\nstrategy (Earl 1989: 135). Such architecture consists of elements as applications, networks, and\nstandards. Melling (1994: 495) stresses that BPR 'is a key element in the factors driving IT\narchitectural change'. If the business operations of an organization change radically, the IT\nframework will have to change accordingly. In this respect, Enterprise Application Integration\ncan be put in a wider context provided by the concept of the IT Architecture. Nowadays, this\ntopic is still being addressed by many leading (Dutch) software vendors, like IBM, Capgemini,\nand Ordina.\n\n2.4\n\nConclusions\n\nBoth Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and Total Quality Management (TQM) focus on\nbusiness processes within organizations. The business process represents the means to deliver a\nproduct or service, whereby the needs of the customer are of primary concern. It is believed\nthat organizations until the late 1980s are predominantly concerned with formal structures,\n9\n\nIn most cases it is simply not feasible to replace the entire IT infrastructure and systems with a better\ndesigned one.\n\n\f10\n\nM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\nfunctions, and control mechanisms. This leads to many mistakes due to handoffs between\ndepartments, and long delays because of authorization issues. By focusing on business\nprocesses instead, these issues can be solved. This requires that organizations have to be\nreengineered . BPR is the most extreme illustration of process thinking, as it seeks to replace the\nentire organizational structure with core business processes that are supported by case teams.\nThese teams are largely self-maintaining and thus require little supervision. Therefore the\nmiddle management of organizations is superfluous.\nThe strategic importance of Information Technology increased in the years prior to BPR, and\ncontinues to do so nowadays. IT is a key issue of BPR, as it is both an important enabler and\nfacilitator of business processes. Because business processes are cross-functional and exceed\nboundaries between departments, existing Information Systems have to be integrated. In\naddition, BPR strongly advocates the strategic importance of Information Technology. Both\naspects contribute to an increased level of complexity of Information Systems, since the scope\nof application of the technology is enlarged. However, the increased level of complexity is\nmainly a technical issue, which Enterprise Application Integration addresses. Therefore,\nInformation Systems Development does not need to change its epistemology to cope with the\naspect of structural complexity.\n\n3\n\nThe Conception of Organization within Process Thinking\n\nTo understand the organizational orientation of process thinking, a wider context of\norganizations is required. This context is provided by a paradigmatic view of sociology. Within\nthis view, the paradigm that best-fits process thinking is discussed. In addition, the General\nSystems Theory is explained, as it functions as a bridge between that paradigm and the\napplication of process thinking. Finally the conception of organization according to Business\nProcess Reengineering \u2013 chosen as an example of process thinking in the previous chapter \u2013 is\nelaborated on in terms of a model of organization.\n\n3.1\n\nA Paradigmatic View on Organization\n\nOrganizations are studied by numerous practitioners and scientists (Jaffee 2001: 1). Unlike\nnatural phenomena, such as biological cells and the solar system, organizations are a human\nconception. Simply to view organizations as a collection of people does not do justice to the\nimpact of organizations on society. Since the study of organizations is such a diverse and\nmultidisciplinary field of research, one can presume the organization as a concept is quite\nintangible. To cope with the complexity of the phenomenon, many researchers have a specific\nframe of reference when studying organizations. For example, economists are likely to view\norganizations as the means to realize an objective of profit 10. Psychologists focus on the\nindividuals within organizations, and give less attention to group behavior or the organization's\nenvironment. Sociology primarily studies the collective behavior of individuals. As Jaffee (2001:\n208) points out, the contribution of sociology to science in general is the insight that individuals\noperate in a social environment. Although many question the value of sociology nowadays\n(Casey 2002), it does encompass a level of analysis that is deemed most appropriate for this\nresearch.\nThe term 'sociology' was first coined between the social philosophers Saint-Simon (1760-1825)\nand August Comte (1798-1857).They endeavored after the establishment of a 'science of social\nphysics' (Casey 2002: 30). This mention of 'physics' implies that they envisioned a rational and\nstructured research methodology to study the fundamental concepts within this emerging field\nof research. This positivist epistemology has been dominant until the mid-20 th century (Casey\n2002: 88), when counter movements battled this dogma in what has been labeled the 'paradigm\nwars' (Goles and Hirschheim 2000). The paradigm wars identified a critical division between the\nfundamental assumptions of social scientific researchers, which could be separated into\n\n10\nThe descriptions non-profit organizations or not-for-profit organizations suggest economists are open to\nother organizational goals. At the same time, these descriptions still illustrate the focus on monetary\nresults.\n\n\fM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\n11\n\nobjectivists and subjectivists (Burrell and Morgan 1979). The objectivists \u2013 in tradition with the\ndominant positivist epistemology \u2013 supported ontological realism, whereas the subjectivists\nadhered to ontological nominalism. An objectivist claims there is a single objective reality that\ncan be identified by a thorough research methodology. Subjectivists on the other hand question\nthe existence of such a reality; let alone that this reality could be described independently from\nits observers. For subjectivists, a phenomenon is only labeled out of convenience, and this label\nshould not be mistaken for a universal truth.\nThe debate between objectivists and subjectivists has not been part of sociology alone. For\nexample, in the field of genetics the work of Barbara McClintock was questioned by many fellow\nresearchers during the 1940s and 50s (Comfort 1995) and did not receive any real credit until\nthe late 1960s and 70s 11. McClintock experimented with corn plants in a very labor-intensive\nway. Instead of treating those plants as uniform crops, she identified herself with each and\nevery single plant. The research she presented was a welter of data, where each and every\nimportant mutation was discussed in light of an extensive and detailed background description\n(Comfort 1995: 1165). In retrospect, McClintock did not rely on ontological realism, but adapted\nan epistemology rooted in ontological nominalism. Later on, in 1983, she received a Nobel Prize\nfor her discovery of 'jumping genes'.\nIn addition to the aforementioned philosophical conflict among sociologists, Burrell and Morgan\n(1979) identified a conflict in the sociologist's theory about the nature of society. The sociology\nof regulation emphasizes the underlying unity and cohesiveness of society, while the sociology\nof radical change tries to explain the unstable nature of society. Burrell and Morgan state that\n'all theories of [organization] are based upon a philosophy of science and a theory of society'\n(Burrell and Morgan 1979: 1). The identified conflicts correspond with the two distinct parts of\ntheir theory of organizations. These conflicts shape the two dimensions within a matrix that is\nused as a typology to identify the basic paradigms 12 within sociology. These paradigms are\nvisualized in Figure 3-1.\nSociology of Radical Change\n\nRadical\nHumanist\n\nRadical\nStructuralist\n\nSubjective\n\nObjective\n\nInterpretive\n\nFunctionalist\n\nSociology of Regulation\nFigure 3-1: Paradigms of social theory (adapted from Burrell and Morgan 1979: 22)\n\nThe functionalist paradigm and the interpretive paradigm share the basic assumption that\nsociety tends to be orderly and stable. Such consensus may be interrupted by temporary\ndisagreement, but it is not overruled. But where functionalists assume this reality is\nontologically prior to man, interpretivists stress that consent is the result of discourse between\nparticipants. Another dispute is the position of the observer. Within the functionalist paradigm,\nthe observer can ultimately describe reality by rational means. This is contrary to the viewpoint\nof interpretivists, who object to the idea of an observer who does not interfere with the\n\n11\n12\n\nSource: the historical description of Barbara McClintock in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (2004) .\nSee \u00a71.3 for a comparison with the paradigm as described by Kuhn.\n\n\f12\n\nM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\nsituation he tries to understand (the so-called Hawthorne effect 13). Especially within sociological\nstudies the participants are likely to interact with the researchers in some way \u2013 be it\nintentional or unintentional \u2013 and alter their behavior accordingly 14. In addition interpretivists\nquestion the linear relationship of cause and effect implied by rationality. In short, functionalists\ntend to use nomothetic approaches, whereas interpretivists adhere to idiographic approaches 15.\nIf radical change is favored over regulation, the paradigms of the radical humanists and the\nradical structuralists come into play. Supporters of the former focus on all forces and barriers\nwithin society that destabilize social institutions, in order to understand and overcome them. On\nthe other hand, radical structuralists emphasize 'the need to overthrow or transcend the\nlimitations placed on existing social and organizational arrangements' (Goles and Hirschheim\n2000: 254).\n\n3.2\n\nGeneral Systems Theory Applied to Organization\n\nThe previous paragraph mentioned that the functionalist paradigm has played an important \u2013 at\ntimes even dominant \u2013 role in the field of sociology throughout the 20 th century 16. Within that\nparadigm \u2013 which can be identified in other fields of research as well 17 \u2013 the work of Von\nBertalanffy has been very influential. As the founder of the General Systems Theory (Von\nBertalanffy 1950; Boulding 1956), his view of systems has had a lot of impact on many scientific\ndisciplines. He responded to the reductionist approach of science \u2013 which had been dominant in\nthe early 1950s \u2013 by propagating a holistic perceptive view. Reductionism highlights a single\nelement or an aspect of a (complex) object of study, which hinders the later integration of the\nvarious findings in a single, coherent description (Nadler 1995: 129). Von Bertalanffy was one of\nthe scientists to notice the interdependence of these elements, and suggested that many\nempirical properties of an object of study can not be reduced to a single element (Van Dinten\n2002: 92). Von Bertalanffy's goal of his systems approach was to demonstrate that most\nscientific disciplines were related to each other in an abstract and general way (Scott 1992: 76).\nEntities such as a biological cell, a group of people, or our solar system can all be regarded as a\nsystem. Although the object of study can be quite different among various disciplines, the\nscientific approach to obtain knowledge about the object is \u2013 or should be \u2013 largely\nhomogeneous.\nA very basic definition of a system is that of a whole consisting of interrelated parts (Morin\n1992). Although systems are widely accepted as an analytical tool to study a phenomenon, they\nremain conceptual constructions, superimposed on the philosophical concept of object 18. Firstly,\nthe definition of the system's boundary is quite arbitrary (Flood and Carson 1988: 7). For\n\n13\nJaffee (2001: 65-73) gives a historical overview of the experiments conducted at the Western Electric\nCompany plant in Hawthorne. In addition, he gives a thorough analysis on the consequences of the\nresearch project on the field of organization theory.\n14\nA particular research methodology that builds upon the idea that the researcher should be part of the\nobject of study \u2013 in order to gain better understanding \u2013 is 'action research'. Kock (2004) gives an\noverview of the application of this methodology within the field of Information Systems Development.\n15\nBrown (1992: 154-5) describes these two types of approaches as \"the study of a single variable in many\nsubjects for the purpose of discovering general laws or principles of behavior\" and \"the thorough study of\nindividual cases, with emphasis on each subject's characteristic traits\" respectively. I would like to stress\nthat generalizing outcomes of idiographic studies to a general model is not without severe limitations.\nSuch an application is rejected from an objectivist point of view, because it has low quantitative backing.\nIn addition, subjectivists should be aware that models are limiting when perceiving or understanding a\nphenomenon. Van Dinten (2002) illustrates these limitations with an analysis of Checkland's Soft Systems\nMethodology and Luhmann's autopoietic system.\n16\nParker (1992) stresses that versions of functionalism remained dominant after the mid-20 t h century, at\nleast until the early 1990s. Apparently the paradigm wars mentioned in the previous paragraph did not\ndiminish this dominance too much.\n17\nFor example, Mingers and Brocklesby (1997) identify three different paradigms: empirical-analytic,\ninterpretive, and critical. The empirical-analytic paradigm is synonymous with the functionalist paradigm of\nBurrell and Morgan.\n18\nThe word object here is meant as object of study . Although this suggests such an object could be clearly\ndefined and be isolated from its environment, I would like to stress that such a separation would be\nimplied by its observer, and is not imposed naturally or physically per se.\n\n\fM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\n13\n\ninstance, it can be useful to enlarge these boundaries if there is an intense interaction between\nan element and its environment. Secondly, a system requires an explicit description of its\nelements. Even though Von Bertalanffy strongly advises that these elements should be studied\nin a coherent manner, one can assume he regarded these elements to be distinguishable from\ntheir context. When the systems concept is applied to different areas of research, the\nfluctuating level of complexity of the imposed system is eminent. Boulding (1956) is one of the\nresearchers who differentiated the complexity of various systems. He described nine different\nlevels of increasing complexity. Every type of system on a succeeding level inherits the\ncomplexity of its predecessor, while adding its own. An overview of these system levels is\npresented in Table 3-1. Although this typology seems intuitively appropriate, it does not provide\na definition or even understanding of the gaps between the various levels (Checkland 1991:\n106).\nLevel\n1.

Transcendental\n'Inescapable unknowables'\nsystems\nTable 3-1: Boulding's hierarchy of real-world complexity (adapted from Checkland 1991: 105)\n\nWhen an organization is viewed as a system, several common attributes can be identified.\nBurrell and Morgan (1979: 63) describe the following general principles of systems theorists,\nwhen they apply their theory to organizations:\na)\nb)\nc)\nd)\ne)\nf)\ng)\nh)\n\nthat the system can be identified by some sort of boundary which differentiates if from its\nenvironment;\nthat the system is essentially processual in nature;\nthat this process can be [conceptualized] in terms of a basic model which focuses upon input ,\nthroughput , output , and feedback ;\nthat the overall operation of the system can be understood in terms of the satisfaction of the\nsystem needs geared to survival or the achievement of homeostasis ;\nthat the system is composed of subsystems which contribute to the satisfaction of the system's\noverall needs;\nthat these subsystems, which themselves have identifiable boundaries, are in a state of mutual\ninterdependence , both internally and in relation to their environment;\nthat the operation of the system can be observed in terms of the [ behavior ] of its constituent\nelements;\nthat the critical activities within the context of system operation are those which involve boundary\ntransactions , both internally between subsystems and externally in relation to the environment.\n\nThe concept of systems is rooted in biology; a scientific discipline in which Von Bertalanffy\nelaborated his theory. In such an area of research, elements can be related to physical,\nempirical entities with relative ease. But if the system's theory is applied to organizations, the\nsingle most complicating factor is the enormous complexity of the phenomenon. Organizations\n\n\f14\n\nM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\nare socio-cultural systems within Boulding's hierarchy, and such systems have the highest level\nof complexity, next to transcendental systems. This makes it hard or impossible to disseminate\nthe system's elements in an unbiased way. In addition, Burrell and Morgan (1979: 68) conclude\nthat most social theorists reach for some kind of analogy in advance of any system to which it is\napplied. Such an analogy \u2013 that is likely to be mechanical or organismic \u2013 reduces the\ncomplexity of the system to an almost elementary model. This is a common problem within\nsystems theory (Morin 1992: 372), but it is especially present in the study of organizations, due\nto the paramount complexity of organizations compared to other phenomena (if Boulding's\nhierarchy is taken into account).\nThe problem of mapping real-world phenomena to system elements has been addressed by\nseveral researchers. Peter Checkland, a renowned researcher in the field of Problem Structuring\nMethodology (Jackson 1991; Mingers 2000; Van Dinten 2002), distinguishes between soft\nsystems and hard systems in his soft systems methodology. He adds on Von Bertalanffy's\ndefinition of a system by including the perception of the system's designer; something he\ndescribes as systems thinking (Checkland 1991: 102). Hard problem situations clearly and\nexplicitly define the problem at hand and the elements involved. Within their definition, goals\nare known, and the performance of possible solutions is measurable. However, soft problems \u2013\nwhich include organizational problems \u2013 possess quite opposite properties. In this respect the\ndefinition of a system should be the end result of a participative discussion between all\nstakeholders involved. Checkland's methodology aims at a structured discussion about\nconceptual models \u2013 each highlighting a specific aspect of the problem situation \u2013 to reach an\nagreement between those involved (Jackson 1991: 156). Checkland's solution to the mapping\nproblem therefore lies in consensus: as long as all participants agree on the systems description\nof the object under debate, such a system can be regarded as 'valid'.\n\n3.3\n\nThe Conception of Organization According to BPR\n\nAs is argued in \u00a73.2, the primary problem when viewing the organization as a system, is the\nsheer complexity that such a view introduces. A model can be helpful in dealing with this\ncomplexity. As mentioned in \u00a73.1, such an abstraction of the object of study is typically\nassociated with the epistemology of the functionalist paradigm. Scott (1992) performed a metatheoretical research study on the subject of organizations from a sociological point of view. In\nthis study, he reviewed roughly 750 books and articles on the field of organization study and\nrelated areas, such as anthropology, psychology, and economics. To identify the characteristics\nof the various research schools, Scott applied a basic model to describe the focal points of the\norganization as the object of study. He emphasizes that these focal points \u2013 or elements \u2013\nshould be studied in an interrelated way. This approach is in line with the General Systems\nTheory (see \u00a73.2 for more details), where the elements are presumed to 'act' coherently. Scott\nassumes the development of the study of organizations to be linear. He labeled three major\ndevelopments, which are successively rational systems, open systems, and natural systems. This\npresumed linear development is opposite to the assumption of Burrell and Morgan, who\nidentified several coexisting paradigms (see \u00a73.1 for more details). Such a linear development is\nalso typically linked with the functionalist paradigm.\nFigure 3-2 represents the model applied by Scott. The gray border represents the boundary\nbetween the organization and its environment. How such a boundary can be obtained is merely\nanother focal point of Scott's research, since this is not implied by his model. The organization\nitself consists of four interrelated elements, which are regarded as equals.\n\n\fM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\n15\n\nEnvironment\nSocial structure\n\nTechnology\n\nGoals\n\nParticipants\n\nOrganization\n\nFigure 3-2: Scott's elements of organization\n\nThe social structure can be analytically separated into two interrelated components. The first is\nthe normative structure, which can be regarded as the formal structure of the organization. It\nacts as a prescription for desired behavior of the organization's participants, and includes\nvalues, norms, and roles. This structure is complemented by the behavioral structure. In likely\ncontrast with the prescribed behavior, the behavioral structure describes the actual behavior of\nparticipants. For instance, recurrent corridor chat between several participants could indicate a\nbalance of power that is different from the formal hierarchy within an organization. The social\nstructure as a whole especially refers to those relationships that can be characterized as\npatterned of regularized. Participants are those individuals that contribute to the organization in\nsome way or another. In return they receive a variety of incentives, which can include salary or\nappreciation of one's work. Those who 'own' the organization are likely to have several goals\nthey wish the organization to fulfill. These goals can include maximization of profit, or taking\ncare of patients. Finally, the technology element represents the means to produce some final\nproduct or deliver some kind of service. This element includes equipment, but also knowledge\nand skills or participants. The latter is a necessary prerequisite to transform the raw materials\ninvolved \u2013 being physical, informational, or human.\nIf Scott's model is used to reflect the organizational orientation of BPR, several aspects can be\nidentified. The primary concern of BPR is radical performance improvement of the organization's\ncore processes. Those processes can e.g. be the manufacturing of a product, or a consulting\nservice provided for customers. The technology element in Scott's model represents the means\nto provide these products or services. Therefore the major concern of the BPR approach is\ntechnological. Business processes are the dominant conception of this focal point of the study of\norganizations. The viability of business processes is judged according to their performance and\nrelevance to the organization's strategy. A detailed discussion of Scott's focal points of\norganization, and the interpretation according to BPR, is presented in Table 3-2.\nFocal point\nSocial structure\n\nParticipants\nGoals\n\n19\n\nInterpretation in BPR\nThe vertical hierarchy should be overthrown and middle-management eliminated.\nThe normative structure is of primary concern, because it can be designed.

They can be\nconvinced from the advantages of this program by using a rationale that is rooted in\nvisionary, strategic remarks 19. This is in line with a top-down management approach.\nThe goals of the organization's owners are embedded in a corporate strategy. This\nstrategy is accompanied by a performance program, which enables measurement of\n\nThe following quote from Hammer and Champy (1993: 148) is an exemplary illustration: ' Getting people\nto accept the idea that their work lives \u2013 their jobs \u2013 will undergo radical change is not a war won in a\nsingle battle. It is an educational and communications campaign that runs from reengineering's start to its\nfinish. It is a selling job that begins with the realization that reengineering is required and doesn't wind\ndown until well after the redesigned processes have been put into place. '\n\n\f16\n\nM.J.

IT should play a major role in the strategy.\nBusiness processes are the major focal point of organizations. Benchmarking and\nperformance measurements are rational instruments to support decision-making of\nthe selection and implementation of those processes. Employees have to be\nreeducated to cope with the new job prescriptions.\nThe environment is turbulent, because competition is growing stronger due to\nglobalization. In addition, consumers are more demanding. This favors mass\ncustomization over mass production.\nTable 3-2: BPR's view on the focal points of organization\n\nClearly the interpretation of the focal points indicates that the model of Scott does not\ncompletely reflect BPR's perception of organizations. While Scott stresses the neutrality of the\nvarious elements, the strategy and the means to reach its objectives are dominant within BPR.\nThis is reflected in the MIT90s framework of Scott Morton. The description of this framework is\nas follows (Scott Morton 1991: 18-9).\nAn organization can be thought of as comprised of five sets of forces in dynamic equilibrium among\nthemselves even as the organization is subjected to influences from an external environment. In\nthis view, a central task of general management is to ensure that the organization, that is, all five\n'forces' (represented by the boxes), moves through time to accomplish the organization's\nobjectives.\n\nFigure 3-3 gives a visual representation of this framework. The central role of management\nwithin organizations is eminent. It is the principal part of organizations that ensures the\norganization responds to changing demands in the external socioeconomic environment.\nManagers also keep track of technological developments, and decide if such developments are\nincorporated.\n\nStructure\n\nStrategy\n\nExternal\nSocioeconomic\nEnvironment\n\nManagement\nProcesses\n\nIndividuals &\nRoles\nCulture\n\nExternal\nTechnological\nEnvironment\n\nTechnology\n\nOrganization\nBoundary\n\nFigure 3-3: The MIT90s framework (adapted from Scott Morton 1991: 20)\n\n3.4\n\nConclusions\n\nSociology is a discipline that studies the collective behavior of individuals. Within sociology\nmany different schools of research exist. They can be differentiated by their philosophy, which\nis at least composed of the view on the nature of organizations (the ontology) and how one can\nobtain knowledge about this nature (the epistemology). The dominant perspective within\nsociology is the so-called functionalist paradigm. Its supporters claim that knowledge \u2013 obtained\nwith a rigorous scientific research methodology \u2013 about organizations will ultimately lead to a\n\n\fM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\n17\n\nsingle, coherent theory. The General Systems Theory has had a lot of influence on this\nparadigm. Within systems the interdependency of elements is of primary concern, because\nelements behave differently in a collective. If organizations are viewed as a system, the\nenormous complexity of this system is paramount. Many social theorists therefore have\nmisapplied the systems theory, and used an early analogy with mechanisms or organisms.\nProcess thinking as illustrated by Business Process Reengineering supports a technocratic\nmanagement perspective of organization. In such a view, organizations are the means to\naccomplish the objectives of the organization's owners. These objectives are embedded within a\ncorporate strategy that is realized by business processes. The accompanying technological focal\npoint of organizations views people as resources to enable these processes. The conception of\norganization according to Business Process Reengineering fits within the aforementioned\nfunctionalist system view. This means that elements that cannot be made explicit in such a\nsystem are likely ignored. In line with a top-down management approach, the system's\nconception of the organization's owners will manifest itself as an undisputable reality. While the\noriginal envisioning of the system by its founders was directed at a holistic view of social\nreality, the misapplication of system's theory within BPR resulted in a reductionist perception\ninstead.\n\n4\n\nBeyond Process Thinking\n\nThe limitations of process thinking are perhaps best illustrated with the high failure rate of\nBusiness Process Reengineering projects. The previously identified management orientation of\nprocess thinking is reflected using the paradigms of social theory of \u00a73.1 and a functionalist\norientation. With the identification of several limitations, some openings to overcome these\nlimitations within the area of Information Systems Development can be presented.\n\n4.1\n\nCritical Analysis of Business Process Reengineering\n\nAs mentioned in \u00a72.2, the Business Process Reengineering movement had its peak in the early\n1990s. BPR largely remained a management practice during the first couple of years, as\nBarothy, Peterhans et al. (1995) only called for the emergence of BPR as a scientific research\nfield in 1995. The high risk of BPR change programs was already brought up in \u00a72.1. Hammer\nand Stanton (1995) indicate that 50 to 70 percent of BPR endeavors actually fail. On the\ndemarcation in time between management and science, both founders of the BPR movement\nacknowledge that their theory has one fatal flaw: it ignores people (Davenport 1995; White\n1996). Although there is an immediate appeal to this explanation of the high failure rate of BPR\nprojects, I think it is merely a symptom. If process thinking is seen as the epistemology of BPR\nto understand organizations, then I suggest that the real cause of BPR's problems lies within its\nconception of organization.\nChapter 2 discussed Business Process Reengineering from a functionalist perception. The\napplied post-modern periodization \u2013 with use of Scott's model of organization 20 \u2013 led to the\nconclusion that the BPR movement adheres to a technocratic management perspective. In such\na view, organizations are the means to realize the goals of its owners. If this outcome is\nreflected using the social theory of Burrell and Morgan (see \u00a73.1 for an elaboration), two\naspects can be identified. The focus on a top-down strategy implies that the conception of the\norganization's owners is dominant. Instead of accepting a more subjective reality, where\ndiscourse between all the participants of the organization \u2013 including management and\nemployees \u2013 is supported, an objectivist viewpoint of organizational reality is adhered to. Next,\nBPR is concerned with radical change as opposed to improvement. Literally, reengineering seeks\nto overcome the bureaucratic organization by getting rid of formal structures, functional work\narrangements and vertical hierarchies. Combining these two observations leads to the\nconclusion that BPR fits within the Radical Structuralist paradigm of Burrell and Morgan.\n\n20\n\nThis model is discussed in \u00a73.3.\n\n\f18\n\nM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\nThe supporters of the BPR movement uphold the bureaucracy as the dominant type of\norganization from the late 18 th century and onwards. To reengineer these bureaucratic\norganizations, their bureaucratic functions are replaced with another mechanism \u2013 the business\nprocess (Morgan 1997: 22). Paradoxically, this is a reincarnation of the approaches found in\norganizations in the early decades of the 20 th century, while BPR was about the overhaul of\nsuch bureaucracies in the first place (Morgan 1997: 386). This perception of organizations can\nbe understood in terms of the machine metaphor of Gareth Morgan (1997: 11-31). If the\norganization is seen as a machine, then the first step is to set goals and objectives \u2013 the\nstrategy. Next one has to organize the means to accomplish this strategy by organizing\nrationally, efficiently, and clearly. Then the human factor will fall into place automatically, since\nthey are submitted to the designed system. Although BPR tries to eliminate the endless formal\nspecifications of work-breakdown structures \u2013 wherein each and every job detail is specified \u2013 it\nis at least questionable if a formal business process specification as a replacement is a real\nimprovement. A fixed set of business processes is more likely to restrain the creativity of people\nthan to encourage it. At best, this hinders the organization's ability to respond to a dynamic\nenvironment. At worst, this will reform the organization into the same sluggish machine it was\ntrying to overcome in the first place.\nEven from a traditional, functionalist point of view the theory of BPR is flawed. Henry Mintzberg,\na renowned researcher within management science, studied several forms of organizations from\na structural orientation. In his theory, the only type of organization that is capable to respond\nto a complex and dynamic environment is the adhocracy 21. Similarly to BPR's process\norganization, an adhocratic organization integrates several functions into a single job.\nSpecialists are grouped in functional units for housekeeping purposes only, since they really\nperform their work in project teams. But contrary to BPR's notion, any form of standardization\nfor coordination should be prevented, because this hinders innovation. This means that\n'information and decision process flow flexibly and informally' (Mintzberg 1979: 433). Although\nthis introduces a lot of overhead, it is a necessity if creativity is valued. BPR standardizes\ncommunication within a set of business processes. Although the employees are empowered and\nentitled to make some authorizations, they are ultimately bound to a corporate-wide strategy.\nThis strategy is top-down, while Mintzberg stresses that strategy should be obtained bottom-up\nand inside-out within the adhocracy. Therefore, BPR cannot uphold its claim that it is a solution\nto organizations in a dynamic environment. BPR can be helpful in situations where performance\nimprovement is required, but it restrains the organization's agility.\n\n4.2\n\nPossible Directions to Overcome Some Limitations of Process Thinking\n\nIf process thinking is applied to define the context of Information Systems \u2013 a subject that is\npart of Information Systems Development \u2013 a conception of organization similar to that of\nBusiness Process Reengineering is used. In such a conception organizations are a system of\nrational actors of which the behavior can be designed. Actual behavior is a blind spot, since it\nwould be the result of irrational behavior. I therefore suggest that process thinking in isolation\nwill not contribute to more effective Information Systems. I think that the solution of the social\nproblems encountered in Information Systems Development requires a broader perspective.\nMost and for all, I think that the acceptance of the subjectivity of one's knowledge \u2013 opposed to\nobjectivist claims \u2013 is a prerequisite to reach such a perspective.\nWithin the bounds of systems theory, I present several directions that can contribute to the\neffectiveness of Information Systems Development.\nConstruct the system using a participative discussion between stakeholders.\n\u2022\nTo prevent the manifestation of a system's view that is constructed by a limited group\nof designers, the Soft Systems Methodology of Peter Checkland \u2013 discussed in \u00a73.2 \u2013\ncould be helpful. Although several functionalist approaches \u2013 such as aspect models\nand rational discussions \u2013 are used in this methodology, at least all the stakeholders\n\n21\nThe 'simple structure' \u2013 another form of organization that could be capable of the required flexibility \u2013 is\ndominated by a single owner, which is only appropriate for small companies. Such a company would\ndepend on the owner's ability to adapt to continuous change.\n\n\fM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\n\u2022\n\n4.3\n\n19\n\nare aware of their limited perception of the situation at hand. As long as the group of\nparticipants is a good representation of all stakeholders, their final system definition\ncould be an acceptable substitute for the problem situation.\n\nApply a more balanced view of the organizational system.\n\nTo obtain a more balanced system's view of the organizational context of Information\nSystems, the organizational model of Scott \u2013 discussed in \u00a73.3 \u2013 could be used. While\nprocess thinking is largely concerned with the focal point of technology, Scott stresses\nthat the other elements \u2013 social structure, goals, and participants \u2013 and the\nenvironment of the organization should receive equal attention.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe BPR orientation does not ignore people, but views them from a technocratic management\nperspective. In this perspective, people in organizations are simply the means to accomplish an\nobjective set out by the owners of these organizations. People are treated as tools that must be\ncontrolled and aligned in an efficient organizational machine. This can be accomplished by\ntraining and education. In this respect, behavior of the organization's participants is designed\nwithin a normative structure, while the actual behavior of those participants is completely\nignored. If this prescribed behavior is a starting point, expecting people to be creative and be\nable to react to changes in their environment is a fallacy. Being creative is not simply an\nobjective that can be set, but is only enabled and stimulated in a proper organizational setting.\nTherefore organizations that are subject to BPR's perspective will not be able to cope with the\nrequirements of a turbulent and dynamic environment, since such environments require\ncreativity and agility of organizations. Business Process Reengineering falls in the same trap of\nthe mechanistic organizations it was trying to counter. The high failure rates of BPR projects do\nnot occur because their practitioners misinterpreted and misapplied the theory, but are a result\nof the theory itself. There is no quick fix to BPR, since the entire foundation of the movement is\nflawed. To overcome its limitations, the entire concept of BPR must be abandoned. As an\nalternative, an epistemology rooted in subjectivism is likely a better direction for research to\nsupport Information Systems Development.\nProcess thinking as illustrated by BPR is an extreme example. In reality, the application of such\nan orientation will not be that extreme, but likely converges with other orientations and\npractices. Nevertheless, it does point to what process thinking could lead to if its application\nremains unquestioned. Within the unification of the General Systems Theory several directions\ncan prove helpful to overcome some limitations of process thinking. Although a system's view\ninevitably will manifest itself as a substitute for organizational reality \u2013 and therefore limits the\nperceptive ability of its studiers \u2013 a somewhat more subjective orientation can be applied by\nmeans of a participative discussion between stakeholders. In addition, if the participants give\nequal attention to different focal points of the organization, such a system could be an\nacceptable reproduction of organization. However, these directions will slow down the process\nof Information Systems Development. Within an organizational setting that focuses on quick\nwins, it might prove helpful to limit the scope of IT projects. If the directions are applied\nsuccessfully in some small projects, it might convince critics of their feasibility.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nThe implementation of business processes has a profound impact on the structure of\norganizations. In addition, the supporters of the process movement advocate the strategic\nimportance of Information Technology. Therefore the structural complexity of Information\nSystems increases. However, this is largely a technical problem that does not require a different\nperspective of those who study it.\nThe real cause of the high failure rates of IT projects is not technical, but lies within their social\ncontext. If stakeholders are confronted rather than consulted, resistance to Information Systems\nincreases and will continue to do so in the future. The dominance of process thinking within\nInformation Systems Development contributes to this development. Process thinking conceives\norganizations as mechanical systems, and therefore expects people to fall into place\nautomatically. This perspective could be a result of the mindset of IT scientists and\npractitioners, since Information Systems are a technical construction that can be designed\n\n\f20\n\nM.J. Dumay / Business Processes: The Theoretical Impact of Process Thinking on ISD\n\ncompletely. But to treat organizations as similar systems leads to many problems, of which\nresistance to new Information Systems is just an effect that comes to the surface.\nTherefore, process thinking is limited in the way it views organizations. Within the General\nSystems Theory several directions are possible to overcome some of the limitations of process\nthinking. But inevitably a system's view manifests itself as a fallacious substitute for\norganizational reality, because it makes elements explicit and is bound to rational behavior. The\nperception of social reality should be continuous and dynamic, and not linearly directed at a\nfixed endpoint. Organizations and their context are fluctuating too, and therefore any\nunderstanding is finite. The required reflexive perception is bound to subjectivity, which means\na single universe of discourse is unattainable. Therefore the true challenge of requirements\nengineers is not to reach an acceptable \u2013 or even optimal \u2013 design, but to reach such a design\nwhile dealing with the conflicts that a subjective universe entails.\nThis research is certainly limited. I have based the conclusion on rational arguments from a\nsingle point of view; that of my own. In addition, I have solely performed a theoretical study\nand did not investigate any cases in real life. This paper aims to inspire fellow IT researchers\nand practitioners to at least question the applicability of process thinking.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Rogier Krieger for critical reading and discussion of the manuscript, to Sjoerd van\nTuinen for critical reading and his comments on social theory, and to Jan Dietz and Hans Mulder\nfor their comments on the application of business processes.\n\nReferences\nAltinkemer, K., A.
