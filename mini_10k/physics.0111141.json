In this paper we apply both methods to a sample laser-plasma interferogram\nobtained with femtoseconds probe pulse, in an experimental setup devoted to laser\nparticle acceleration studies.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe phase-shift extraction from interferogram images is generally performed via a straightforward method based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) (Takeda, 1982). This method is\nfast and generally very effective, but it can fail in producing accurate phase-shift maps in\nfacing with low quality fringe structures. Unfortunately, the number of physical processes\nthat can degrade the fringe visibility is very large. Even if the effects of some of these sources\ncan be strongly reduced with refinement of the interferometry techniques (e.g. in the case\n1\n\n\fof uncorrelated noise in the image, non uniform illumination...) or a reduction of the probe\nduration (in the case of fringe smearing due to the plasma evolution), the effect of the deviation of the probe light due to strong electronic density gradients cannot be eliminated in the\ninterferometer acquisition step. As a result, standard FFT technique hardly work properly\nwhen applied to interferograms of very steep density gradients. Recently (Tomassini et. al.,\n2001) a new method to extract the phase-shift map from interferograms has been proposed.\nThe new method IACRE (\"Interferogram Analysis via Continuous wavelet transform Ridge\nExtraction\") takes advantage of the combined spatial and spectral resolution of the Continuous Wavelet Transforms (CWT) (Holschneider, 1995) to identify the fringe structures and\nresults more flexible, accurate and robust than standard FFT based one.\nOnce the phase-shift map has been obtained, one has to face with Abel Inversion in order\nto retrieve the 2D electronic density map. The Abel Inversion method is based on the strong\nassumption that the full 3D electronic density is axisymmetric along an axis parallel to the\ninterferometry plane. This assumption is often poorly verified and if we force in using Abel\nInversion we can introduce large errors in the density map, especially near the best estimated\nsymmetry axis. In a recent procedure (Tomassini and Giulietti, 2001), Abel Inversion has\nbeen generalized and can be applied to density distributions with a moderate asymmetry. As\na corollary, this generalized Abel Inversion provides a first step in 3D density map extraction.\nIn this paper we show the preliminary results of the analysis of interferograms obtained\nwith femtosecond laser pulses probing plasmas produced by the exploding foils technique.\nThe set of interferograms has been produced in order to characterize the plasma before,\nduring and after the passage of a ultrastrong laser pulse, in an experimental setup devoted\nto the study of the production of multi-MeV electrons generated by laser-plasma interactions\n(Giulietti et. al., 2001).\n\n2\n\nInterferometry setup\n\nThe experiment has been performed on the Salle Jaune of the Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquee with a laser pulse of wavelength 0.82\u03bcm delivering 1Joule in 35f s. A portion of the\npulse has been doubled in frequency with a KDP cristal (probe pulse) and the remaining\nportion (main pulse) has been focused with an off-axis parabola on the target, a thin foil of\nFORMVAR (see Fig. 1).\nThe nanosecond Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) which precedes the main pulse\nmakes the foil to explode in the focal spot. As a consequence, the main pulse interacts with\na preformed plasma of peak density well below the critical density and of scalelength of few\ntens of \u03bcm's.\nThe interferometry pulse probes the plasma in a direction parallel to the plastic foil, i.e.\nperpendicular to the plasma expansion axis which is also roughly the plasma symmetry axis.\nA modified Normarski interferometrt setup (Benattar et al., 1979) is used to generate the\n2\n\n\finterferometry images on a CCD camera (see Figg. 1 and 2).\n\n3\n\nThe phase-shift extraction with the IACRE method\n\nA detailed description of the IACRE method and an accurate comparison between IACRE\nand the standard FFT-based methods performances has been published elsewere (Tomassini,\nGiulietti and Gizzi, 2000; Tomassini et. al., 2001). In this section we will just sketch the\nmain steps of the novel method.\nConsider the interferogram of Fig. 3. It has been produced 10ps after the interaction of\na preformed plasma with a 35f s main pulse focused on it with an intensity of 1020 W/cm2 .\nThe laser radiation came from the right hand side and the plasma is approximately\nsymmetric along the horizontal x coordinate. The two black arrows refer to the positions of\nthe two images of the target, while the boxes show the two analyzed regions, one on the side\nof the incoming laser radiation (the right one) and one on the rear side.\nTo apply the IACRE method to the each sub-image (left and right boxes), we extract\nthe phase shift \u03b4\u03c6(z, x) as follow. For each z build a sequence sz (x) by taking the line-out\nof the sub-image. Next:\n\u2022 compute the Continuous Wavelet Transform coefficients Cs (a, b) of sz (x), being a and\nb the \"voice\" and \"time\" parameters, respectively;\n\u2022 detect the \"Ridge\" R(Cs ) of the Cs map, recording the phase \u03c6(x) of the signal rebuilted with R(Cs );\n\u2022 estimate the wavevector kp of the unperturbed fringes and, finally, compute the phaseshift \u03b4\u03c6(z, x) as\n\u03b4\u03c6(z, x) = \u03c6(z, x) \u2212 kp x .\n(3.1)\nThe analysis of the test interferogram is complicated by the presence of fringe curvature\nalso in absence of the plasma. This problem has been solved by acquiring a \"Mask\" interferogram (without plasma) before each shot. A phase-shift of the \"Mask\" \u03b4\u03c6M ask is estimated\nand the corrected phase-shift due to the electronic plasma density \u03b4\u03c6P lasma is obtained simply\nas\n\u03b4\u03c6P lasma = \u03b4\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6M ask .\n(3.2)\nThe results for the left and right boxes sub-images are reported in Fig. 4.\nThe two phase-shift maps of the front (right box) and rear (left box) sides of the plasma\nhave quite similar structures, with strong evidence of a hole in the electronic density near the\ntarget, where steep density gradients occur. These gradients are responsible of the reduction\nof fringe visibility at the edges of the hole.\n3\n\n\f4\n\nNon axisymmetric Abel Inversion\n\nWe now proceed in the estimation of the electronic density map ne . As it is clear in Fig. 4,\nthe phase-shift maps are not really mirror symmetric so we expect that the computation of ne\nvia standard Abel Inversion could introduce relevant errors. We then apply the Generalized\nAbel Inversion (Tomassini and Giulietti, 2001) to the corrected phase-shift maps (left and\nright boxes) in order to minimize inversion errors. As in the standard Abel Inversion, the\nposition z0 of the best symmetry axis must be determined by maximizing, for example, the\ncross-correlation between the two half maps\n\u03b4\u03c6+ (\u03b6, x) = \u03b4\u03c6P lasma (z \u2212 z0 , x) z > z0 ,\n\u03b4\u03c6\u2212 (\u03b6, x) = \u03b4\u03c6P lasma (z0 \u2212 z, x) z < z0 ;\n\n(4.3)\n\nnext two 2D maps n0 (r, x) and n1 (r, x) are numerically computed with the integrals:\n\u03bbp Z \u221e\n1\n\u2202\nn0 (r, x) = \u2212nc 2\nd\u03b6 \u221a 2\n\u03b4\u03c6s (\u03b6, x)\n2\n\u03c0 r\n\u03b6 \u2212 r \u2202\u03b6\n!\n1\n\u2202 \u03b4\u03c6a (\u03b6, x)\n\u03bbp Z \u221e\n,\nd\u03b6 \u221a 2\nn1 (r, x) = \u2212nc 2 r\n\u03c0\n\u03b6\n\u03b6 \u2212 r 2 \u2202\u03b6\nr\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere nc is the critical density for the probe wavelength \u03bbp and \u03b4\u03c6s , \u03b4\u03c6a are the symmetrized\nand anti-symmetrized half maps:\n\u03b4\u03c6s \u2261\n\n\u0011\n\u0011\n1\u0010 +\n1\u0010 +\n\u03b4\u03c6 (\u03b6) + \u03b4\u03c6\u2212 (\u03b6) , \u03b4\u03c6a \u2261\n\u03b4\u03c6 (\u03b6) \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6\u2212 (\u03b6) .\n2\n2\n\nThe 3D electron density map can now be built-up as follow. First, the map is mirrorsymmetric along the x \u2212 z plane. This assumption is necessary because in the process of\nformation of the interferogram an integration along the y direction is made. Consider then\none half space (let's say the one with y positive) and, for each x, identity a point in the y \u2212 z\nplane by using polar coordinates (r, \u03b8). Finally, the three dimensional map\nn(r, \u03b8, x) = n0 (r, x) + n1 (r, x) cos(\u03b8)\n\n(4.5)\n\nrepresents the best estimation of the electronic density map obtained with the Generalized\nAbel Inversion. In Fig. 5 the projection in the x \u2212 z plane of the density map at both sides\nof the target is reproduced, while in Fig. 6 a sequence of slices of the 3D density map in the\nleft box at constant x is shown.\nThe projection of the density maps onto the x \u2212 z plane (see Figg. 5 and 6) confirms the\npresence of a dramatic density depression (hole) along the laser propagation path, near the\noriginal target position.\n4\n\n\f5\n\nComments\n\nWe applied the IACRE and Generalized Abel Inversion to a sample interferogram, obtained\njust few ps after the interaction of an ultraintense femtosecond laser pulse with a preformed\nplasma from an exploding thin foil. The density map evidences the creation of a sharp\nelectron density depression near the original target position.\nWe mention that the methods has been also applied to a series if interferograms taken\nbefore, during and after the propagation of the ultrarelativistic 35f s pulse with the plasma.\nThe analysis is still in progress and preliminary results confirm (Tomassini et al., 2001)\nthat the IACRE method is much more robust and sensitive than standard FFT-based\nmethod, which frequently failed in producing reasonably accurate phase-shift maps. We\nthen expect that IACRE and Generalized Abel Inversion methods will give a strong contribution in the comprehension of such an extreme laser-plasma interaction regime.\n\n6\n\nReferences\n\nBenattar, R., Popovics, M., Siegel, R., Polarized light interferometer for laser fusion studies,\nRev.Sci.Instrum. 50, 1583 (1979)\nHolschneider, M. ; Wavelet: An analysis tool, Clarendon Press -Oxford (1995).\nTakeda, M., Ina, H., Kobayashi, S.
