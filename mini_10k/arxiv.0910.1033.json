Indeed, given q linearly independent closed forms of degree one, it is possible to\nfind new closed forms arbitrarily close to the originals and having rational periods. The foliation\ndefined by these new forms has all leaves compact and these leaves are the fibers of a locally\ntrivial fibration over the torus. All this can be seen as embedded in the theory of Lie-foliations\n[10], [12]. Let g be a Lie algebra of dimension q and let M be a smooth closed manifold. We\nsay that a foliation F of codimension q on M is a g-Lie foliation if, given structure constants\n{ckij } of g, there exists a system {\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9q } of linearly independent smooth forms of degree\nP\none on M which satisfies d\u03c9k = \u2212 i<j ckij \u03c9i \u2227 \u03c9j and whose kernel is tangent to F. Let G be\na connected Lie group having g as Lie algebra. A foliation F on M is a Lie g-foliation if and\nonly if F admits a Lie transverse structure modeled by G (see [12]), that is, F is defined by\nlocal submersions taking values on G with transition maps given by left translations on G. The\nexistence of Lie foliation does not guarantee the existence of a global submersion of M in G. The\ndifficulty in obtaining such a submersion from a Lie foliation F can be measured by the global\nholonomy group of F with respect to G, which is a representation of the fundamental group of\nM in G. In his thesis, Fedida proves that, in fact, the structure of F is strongly related to its\nglobal holonomy ([10], [12]). In this work, we obtain a generalization of the Tischler fibration\nTheorem for g-Lie foliations, when g is a compact Lie algebra, in the sense that g is the Lie\nalgebra of some compact Lie group:\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1. Let g be a compact Lie algebra, M a smooth closed manifold and F a Lie gfoliation on M . Let G be a connected compact Lie group having g as Lie algebra. If the closure\nof the global holonomy of F with respect to G has Abelian Lie algebra, then M possesses a finite\ncovering which fibers over G. Indeed, there is a finite covering of M where the lifting of F can\nbe C 0 -approximated by Lie g-foliations having all leaves compact.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 gives a description of the structure of the foliation, and this allows\nus to well understand the finite covering mentioned. Combining our result with a result due to\nCaron and Carri\u00e8re ([6]), we have\nCorollary 1. Let g be a semisimple compact Lie algebra and let F be a (not necessarily minimal) one-dimensional Lie g-foliation on a smooth closed manifold M . We have\n1. there is a finite covering of M where the lifting of F can be C 0 -approximated by Lie\ng-foliations having all leaves compact;\n2. If G is the simply connected Lie group having g as Lie algebra, then M possesses a finite\ncovering which fibers over G.\nAn important remark in the theory is that the closure of the global holonomy of a Lie\nfoliation must be an Abelian group provided that the fundamental group of M is Abelian.\nIn this work, we extend this observation by proving that if the fundamental group of M is\namenable and G is compact, then the closure of the global holonomy of F has Abelian Lie\nalgebra. Thus, we can apply Theorem A to obtain the following:\nTheorem 2. Let g be a compact Lie algebra and M a smooth closed manifold with amenable\nfundamental group. If M admits a Lie g-foliation, then there is a finite covering of M where\nthe lifted foliation can be C 0 -approximated by Lie g-foliations having all leaves compact. If G\nis a compact Lie group having g as Lie algebra, then M possesses a finite covering which fibers\nover G.\nWe also studied the particular case where the fundamental group of the ambient manifold\nhas subexponential growth and g is not necessarily compact:\nTheorem 3. Let M be a smooth closed manifold with fundamental group of subexponential\ngrowth and suppose that M admits a Lie g-foliation. We have:\n1. If G is a connected Lie group having g as Lie algebra, then G has polynomial volume\ngrowth;\n2. If s < g is a Levi factor of g and S is a connected Lie group having s as Lie algebra, then\nS is compact and M possesses a finite covering which fibers over S.\nIn the semisimple case, the result above has the following statement:\nCorollary 2. Let M be a smooth closed manifold which admits a Lie g-foliation where g is a\nsemisimple Lie algebra. If g is non-compact then the fundamental group of M has exponential\ngrowth. If the fundamental group of M has subexponential growth then any connected Lie group\nG having g as Lie algebra is compact and M possesses a finite covering which fibers over G.\nThe concept of Lie foliations admits a natural generalization: Let G be a connected Lie group\nof dimension n and let K be a connected closed Lie subgroup of G of dimension n \u2212 q. Let g and\nk be the Lie algebras of G and K, respectively. Let \u03b2 = {X1 , . . . , Xq , Xq+1 , . . . , Xn } be a basis\n2\n\n\fof g such that Xq+1 , . . . , Xn is a basis of k and denote by {ckij } the structure constants of \u03b2. Suppose that a smooth P\nmanifold M admits n smooth forms of degree one \u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9q , \u03c9q+1 , . . . , \u03c9n\nsatisfying d\u03c9k = \u2212 i<j ckij \u03c9i \u2227 \u03c9j . If the forms \u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9q are linearly independent at each\npoint of M , then they define a foliation F of codimension q on M and, for this case, we can\nadapt Theorem A. Such a foliation admits a structure of transversely homogeneous foliation\nmodeled by G/K (see [2], [12]), that is, F is defined by local submersions taking values on\nG/K with transition maps given by left translations on G. Similar structures are constructed,\nas a global holonomy group ([12], [2]). We should note, however, that not every transversely\nhomogeneous foliation is obtained from global forms of degree one. Our preceding results together with results of Blumenthal ([2], [3]), give the following fibration result for transversely\nhomogeneous foliations:\nTheorem 4. Let G be a connected compact Lie group, K a closed and connected subgroup of\nG and let M be a smooth closed manifold with amenable fundamental group. Given a G/Ktransversely homogeneous foliation F on M , suppose one of the following conditions is satisfied\n1. H 1 (M, K) is trivial;\n2. the normal bundle of F is trivial and G/K is a simply-connected Riemannian homogeneous space of constant curvature.\nThen there is a finite covering of M where the lifting of F can be C 0 -approximated by G/Ktransversely homogeneous foliations. Moreover, M possesses a finite covering which fibers over\nG/K.\nWe stress that conditions (1) and (2) in Theorem 4 above are used in order to assure that the\nhomogeneous transverse structure is given by globally defined one-forms and can be replaced\nby this hypothesis, which may also verified in some other situations.\nCorollary 3. Let F be an one-dimensional SO(2q + 1)/SO(2q)-transversely homogeneous foliation with trivial normal bundle on a smooth closed manifold M . Then there is a finite covering\nof M where the lifting of F can be C 0 -approximated by SO(2q + 1)/SO(2q)-foliations having\nall leaves compact. If M is orientable and q = 1, then the finite covering mentioned is either\nthe identity or a double covering of M .\n\n2\n\nLie foliations\n\nLet us recall the formal definition and main properties we need concerning Lie foliations (see\n[12], [10] for more):\nDefinition 1. Let M be a smooth manifold and g a Lie algebra of dimension q. We say that\na codimension q foliation F on M is a Lie g-foliation if F is tangent to the kernel of a smooth\nform of degree one \u03a9 on M with values in g such that\n1. \u03a9(x) : Tx M \u2192 g is surjective, for each x \u2208 M ;\n2. d\u03a9 + 21 [\u03a9, \u03a9] = 0.\nLet X1 , . . . , Xq be a basis of a Lie algebra g with structure constants {ckij }. If there are\nlinearly independent\nforms of degree\n\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9q on a smooth manifold M which satisfy\nP\nPone\nq\nk\nd\u03c9k = \u2212 i<j cij \u03c9i \u2227 \u03c9j , then \u03a9 = l=1 \u03c9l Xl is a form of degree one on M with values in g\n3\n\n\fsatisfying the second item of Definition 1. Conversely, let \u03a9 be a smooth form\nPqof degree one\non M with\nP values in g satisfying (2). If X1 , . . . , Xq is a basis of g and \u03a9 = l=1 \u03c9l Xl , then\nd\u03c9k = \u2212 i<j ckij \u03c9i \u2227 \u03c9j . The form \u03a9 is surjective in each point of M if and only if the forms\n\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9q are linearly independent in each point of M . Moreover, the kernel of \u03a9 coincides\nwith the kernel of the system {\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9q }. Therefore, a codimension q foliation F on M is\na Lie g-foliation if and only if F is tangent to the kernel of a system {\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9q } of smooth\nlinearly independent forms of degree one on M which satisfies\nX\nd\u03c9k = \u2212\nckij \u03c9i \u2227 \u03c9j .\ni<j\n\nExample 1. A Lie Rr -foliation on a smooth manifold M is a foliation defined by the kernel of\nr smooth linearly independent closed forms of degree one on M .\nExample 2. Let \u03c0 : E \u2192 M be a G-principal bundle. If a connection form \u03a9 one E is flat,\nthat is, has zero curvature, then \u03a9 satisfies d\u03a9 = \u2212 12 [\u03a9, \u03a9] (see [17], pg 78, 92-94). Therefore,\n\u03a9 defines a Lie g-foliation F on E which is transverse to the fibers.\nWe also recall the concept of Lie transverse structure for foliations:\nDefinition 2. Let F be a codimension q foliation on a differentiable manifold M and let G\nbe a q-dimensional Lie group. A Lie transverse structure of model G for F is given by a\nfamily of submersions {fi : Ui \u2192 G}i\u2208\u039b and a family of locally constant maps gij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192\n{left translations on G} such that\n1. {Ui }i\u2208\u039b is an open cover of M ;\n2. the plaques of F in Ui are given by fi = constant;\n3. fi (x) = gij (x) \u25e6 fj (x), \u2200x \u2208 Ui \u2229 Uj .\nThe result bellow allow us to understand the relation between Lie g-foliations and a foliation\nwith a Lie transverse structure:\nDarboux-Fedida's Theorem. Let M be a smooth manifold and let F = F\u03a9 be a Lie gfoliation on M . Let G be a connected Lie group having g as Lie algebra and denote by \u03b1 its\nMaurer-Cartan form. Denote by \u03c6 the natural action of G on M \u00d7 G by left translations and\nlet p1 : M \u00d7 G \u2192 M and p2 : M \u00d7 G \u2192 G be the canonical projections. We have that:\n1. The form \u0398 on M \u00d7 G with values in g defined by\n\u0398(x,g) (u, v) = \u03a9(x)u \u2212 \u03b1(g)v\ninduces on M \u00d7 G a codimension q foliation G;\n2. G is invariant by \u03c6, that is, for each g \u2208 G, the diffeomorphism \u03c6g take leaves of G over\nleaves of G.\n3. The leaves of G are transversal to the orbits of \u03c6.\n4. If M \u2032 is a leaf of G, the map p1 |M \u2032 : M \u2032 \u2192 M is a Galoisian covering. The automorphism\ngroup of this covering is associated with a homomorphism h : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 G which satisfies\n\u03b1(p) = \u03c6h(\u03b1) (p), \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 \u03c01 (M ) and p \u2208 M \u2032\nand whose image is h(\u03c01 (M )) = {g \u2208 G; \u03c6g (M \u2032 ) = M \u2032 };\n4\n\n\f5. The map p2 |M \u2032 : M \u2032 \u2192 G is a submersion;\n6. p\u22171 (\u03a9)|M \u2032 \u2261 p\u22172 (\u03b1)|M \u2032 .\nConsider the notations used in the Darboux-Fedida's Theorem. The group \u0393 = h(\u03c01 (M )) <\nG is called global holonomy group of F with respect to G, or, for simplicity, holonomy global of\nF. We observe that, fixed the form \u03a9 and the Lie group G, the global holonomy group of F\nwith respect to G is well defined up to a conjugation by an element of G, because it also depends\non the choice of the leaf M \u2032 of foliation G. Throughout the work, if F = F\u03a9 is a Lie g-foliation\non M and G is a connected Lie group which has g as Lie algebra, we denote by \u0393(\u03a9, G) the\nglobal holonomy group of F constructed according to Darboux-Fedida' Theorem, after having\nchosen a leaf M \u2032 of the foliation G. Still using the notations of the Darboux-Fedida Theorem,\nconsider the Galoisian covering P1 = p1 |M \u2032 : M \u2032 \u2192 M , the submersion P2 = p2 |M \u2032 : M \u2032 \u2192 G\nand the homomorphism o h : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 G associated to P1 . We have that\ni. P2 is equivariant by h, that is, P2 (\u03b1(x)) = h(\u03b1) \u2217 P2 (x) ;\nii. P1\u2217 (F) is the foliation defined by P2 ;\nThe data (M \u2032 , P2 , G, h) is a G-development for F (see [12]). If we choose another leaf M \u2032\u2032 of G\ndifferent of M \u2032 , we obtain another G-development (M \u2032\u2032 , P\u03032 , h\u0303, G) for F. The two developments\nare related as follows: h\u0303 = g \u2217h\u2217g\u22121 e P\u03032 = g \u2217P2 , for an element g \u2208 G such that \u03c6g (M \u2032 ) = M\u0303 .\nUsing a development, it is easy to obtain a Lie transverse structure of model G for the foliation.\nConversely, let F be a foliation that admits a Lie transverse structure of model G. If \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1q\nare linearly independent forms of degree one in G invariant by left translations with structure\nconstants {ckij }, then we can use the local submersions that define F to obtain smooth linearly\nP\nindependent global forms of degree one \u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9q on M which satisfy d\u03c9k = i<j ckij \u03c9i \u2227 \u03c9j .\nTherefore, a foliation F is a Lie g-foliation if and only if F admits a G-development. Moreover,\nF is a Lie g-foliation, if and only if F admits a Lie transverse structure of model G.\nWe say that a Lie algebra g is compact if it is the Lie algebra of some compact connected Lie\ngroup. The example bellow describes a known method of obtaining examples of Lie g-foliations\non compact manifolds when g is compact:\nExample 3. Let G be a connected compact Lie group, N a compact manifold and h : \u03c01 (N ) \u2192\nG a homomorphism of the fundamental group of N in G. Denote by \u00d1 the universal covering\nof N and consider the diagonal action of \u03c01 (N ) on \u00d1 \u00d7 G defined by \u03b1(x, g) 7\u2192 ((x)\u03b1, h(\u03b1)\u22121 g).\nSuch \u0010action is\u0011 properly discontinuous and this allow us to give a smooth structure which turns\nE = \u00d1 \u00d7 G /\u03c01 (N ) a (compact) manifold. Moreover, we can define a foliation F on E which\nis transverse to the fibers of E. Such foliation admits a Lie transverse structure of model G\nand thus is a Lie g-foliation.\nThe result below is contained in Fedida's work:\nFedida's Theorem ([10]). Let M be a compact manifold and G a connected Lie group with\nLie algebra g. If F = F\u03a9 is a Lie g-foliation on M with global holonomy \u0393 = \u0393(\u03a9, G), then\nthere is a locally trivial fibration P : M \u2192 \u0393 \\ G such that each fiber F-saturated subset of M .\nIn particular, \u0393 \\ G is compact.\nRemark 1. When G is a simply-connected Lie group, there exists a more complete version of\nthe Fedida's Theorem. In this case, the fibration P : M \u2192 \u0393 \\ G has connected fibers and F\ninduces on each fiber of P a minimal Lie h-foliation, where h is the Lie algebra of \u0393.\n5\n\n\f3\n\nFoliations invariant under transverse actions\n\nThe Lie g-foliation in Example 2 has a special property: there is a smooth action \u03c6 on the\nambient manifold which preserve the leaves of F and whose orbits are transversal to F. The\nsame is true for the foliation G defined on M \u00d7 G in Darboux-Fedida's Theorem. They are part\nof a special class of foliations called G-i.u.t.a. foliations ([1]), which we describe more formally:\nLet G be a q-dimensional connected Lie group and G a codimension q foliation on a smooth\nmanifold E. We say that G is a G-i.u.t.a. foliation (or invariant under transverse action of G)\nif there is a smooth locally free action \u03c6 of G on E whose orbits are transverse to G and such\nthat, for each g \u2208 G, \u03c6g take leaves of G diffeomorphically over leaves of G. In [1], the authors\nconstruct a development for this class of foliations. In particular, if g is the Lie algebra of G,\nthen a G-i.u.t.a. foliation is a Lie g-foliation. The converse is not necessarily true (see [1]).\nProposition 1 (Fedida's Theorem for G-i.u.t.a. foliations). Let E be a smooth closed manifold\nlet and G be a G-i.u.t.a. foliation on E. Let L be a leaf of G and consider the subgroup\n\u0393 = {g \u2208 G; \u03c6g (L) = L}. There is a locally trivial fibration with connected fibers P : E \u2192 G/\u0393\nsuch that each fiber is a G-saturated subset of E. Moreover, G induces on the fiber containing\nL a minimal Lie h-foliation, where h is the Lie algebra of de \u0393.\nProof. Let \u03c6 be the G-action on E which preserves G. Let p1 : G \u00d7 L \u2192 G be the canonical\nprojection. It follows from Theorem 1 of [1] that the map\n\u03c6|G\u00d7L : G \u00d7 L \u2192 E\nis a Galoisian covering map and that there is a unique P : E \u2192 G/\u0393 such that the diagram\nG\u00d7L\n\n\u03c6|G\u00d7L\n\n/E\n\np1\n\n(1)\n\nP\n\n\u000f\n\nG\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\n/ G/\u0393\n\nis commutative. We conclude that P is a submersion and, since E is compact, P is a locally\ntrivial fibration. We affirm that \u0393 = H = {g \u2208 G; \u03c6g (L) = L}. In fact, the closed set P \u22121 ([e])\ncontains L. Therefore, by Diagram 1, we have that H \u2282 \u0393. Since E is compact, if g \u2208 \u0393, then\n\u22121\n\u03c6g (L) \u2282 L. On the other hand, if g \u2208 \u0393, then g \u22121 \u2208 \u0393. Thus \u03c6g (L) \u2282 L and \u0393 \u2282 H. Let L1\nbe a leaf of G contained in P \u22121 ([e]). There is g \u2208 G such that \u03c6g (L) = L1 . Since L1 \u2282 P \u22121 ([e]),\nwe have that g \u2208 \u0393. Therefore, L1 \u2282 \u03c6g (L) = L, and we conclude that P \u22121 ([e]) = L. Since \u03c6\npreserves G, we have L = \u03c6g (L) = \u03c6g (L) = L1 . Therefore, G induces on L a minimal foliation.\nIf H0 is the connected component of H containing the identity, G induces on L a H0 -i.u.t.a.\nfoliation and thus a Lie h-foliation.\n\n4\n\nLie foliations with compact Lie algebra\n\nIn this section we study the structure of Lie g-foliations when g is compact proving Theorem A.\nProof of the Theorem A. We can suppose that M is orientable, taking the orientable double\ncovering if necessary. Let G be the foliation on E = M \u00d7 G constructed in Darboux-Fedida\nTheorem. If p1 : M \u00d7 G \u2192 M and p2 : M \u00d7 G \u2192 G are the canonical projections and M \u2032 is a\n\n6\n\n\fleaf of G, we have that p1 |M \u2032 : M \u2032 \u2192 M is a Galoisian covering. The automorphism group of\nthis covering is associated with a homomorphism h : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 G whose image is\n\u0393 = {g \u2208 G; \u03c6g (M \u2032 ) = M \u2032 },\nthe global holonomy of F. Moreover, the natural action \u03c6 on E = M \u00d7G by left tranlations turns\nG a G-i.u.t.a. foliation. From Fedida's Theorem (for G-i.u.t.a. foliations), there is a fibration\nP : E \u2192 G/\u0393 such that the fiber N = P \u22121 ([e]) is the closure of the leaf M \u2032 . Moreover, we have\nthat\n1. \u0393 = H = {g \u2208 G; \u03c6g (N ) = N };\n2. the foliation on N induced for G is a minimal h-Lie foliation, where h is a Lie algebra of\n\u0393.\nBy hypothesis, \u03930 is Abelian and, thus, G induces on N a minimal Lie Rr -foliation T , for some\nr \u2208 N. now we divide the proof in two cases:\nFirst case. H is connected.\nFor our proposes, we could consider only the restriction of G on N . However, we will construct a perturbation of the foliation G in E. For this, we adapt a beautiful argument presented\nby E. Ghys in the proof of Theorem A of [11]. The homogeneous space G/H is orientable (see\nProp. 5.15 of [4]). Since E is orientable, each fiber of P is orientable. Fix an orientation in\nN . Dado [g] \u2208 G/H, we can consider an orientation in Ng = \u03c6g (N ) induced by \u03c6g . Since\nH is connected, such a orientation is consistent, that is, it does not depend on the choice of\ng \u2208 [g]. Consider E endowed with a Riemannian metric invariant by \u03c6 and on each fiber of P ,\nconsider the metric induced by E. Let \u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9r be smooth linearly independent closed forms\non N which define T . Given [g] \u2208 G/H, consider the fiber Ng = \u03c6g (N ) of P . We can use the\ndiffeomorphism \u03c6g and the forms \u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9r to obtain smooth closed forms \u03c9(1,g) , . . . , \u03c9(r,g) on\nNg . These forms are well defined, that is, they does not depend on the choice of g \u2208 [g]. In fact,\nif l \u2208 H and f = \u03c6l |N : N \u2192 N , then f is isotopic to identity, because H is connected conexo.\nTherefore, for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , r}, there is a function hi : N \u2192 R such that f\u2217 \u03c9i \u2212 \u03c9i = dhi . On\nthe other hand, since f preserves T , we have that hi is a basic function for T (see [20], pag 34).\nThis implies that hi is constant along the leaves of T . Since T has dense leaves, hi is constant\nand thus f\u2217 (\u03c9i ) = \u03c9i for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , r}, and the assertion is proved. Since \u03c6 preserves\nthe leaves of G, we have that \u03c9(1,g) , . . . , \u03c9(r,g) define the foliation induced by G on Ng . From\nTischler's Theorem, there are arbitrarily small harmonic closed forms of degree one u1 , . . . , ur\non N such that\n\u03b11 = (\u03c91 + u1 ) , . . . , \u03b1r = (\u03c9r + ur )\nare linearly independent and define a Rr -Lie foliation on N having all leaves compact. Using\nthe diffeomorphism \u03c6g and the forms u1 , . . . , ur we obtain De Rham cohomology classes\n[u(1,g) ], . . . , [u(r,g) ]\non Ng . Since H is connected, this can be done consistently. For each k > k0 and each\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , r}, consider the only harmonic form u(i,g) in the cohomology class [u(i,g) ]. For each\ng \u2208 G, we have that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c6g\u2217 (\u03c9i + ui ) = \u03c6g\u2217 \u03c9i + u(i,e) = \u03c9(i,g) + u(i,g) .\n(2)\n7\n\n\fIn fact, \u03c6g\u2217 (\u03c9i ) = \u03c9(i,g) and \u03c6g takes the cohomology class of u(i,e) in the cohomology class\nof u(i,g) . But there is a only \u0001harmonic representative in the class [u(i,g) ] and \u03c6g is a positive\nisometry. Therefore, \u03c6g\u2217 u(i,e) = u(i,g) and assertion is proved. The forms\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c9(1,g) := \u03c9(1,g) + u(1,g) , . . . , \u03c9(r,g) := \u03c9(r,g) + u(r,g)\ndefine on Ng a Lie Rr -foliation having all leaves compact. Since \u03c6 acts transitively on G/H,\nwe have a new foliation G\u0303 on E satisfying:\n\u0001\n\u2022 In the fiber Ng , the foliation G\u0303 \u00e9 defined by the closed forms \u03c9(i,g) + u(i,g) , para i =\n1, . . . , r;\n\u2022 G\u0303 is invariant by \u03c6 and has all leaves compact.\nSince E is compact, if u1 , . . . , ur are sufficiently small, the foliation G\u0303 remains transversal to \u03c6.\nIf M \u2032\u2032 is a leaf of G\u0303, we have that\np1 |M \u2032\u2032 : M \u2032\u2032 \u2192 M\nis a finite Galoisian covering and the group\n\u0393\u0303 = {g \u2208 G; \u03c6g (M \u2032\u2032 ) = M \u2032\u2032 }\nis finite. Moreover, since N is compact, if u1 , . . . , ur are sufficiently small, we have that\np2 |M \u2032\u2032 : M \u2032\u2032 \u2192 G\nis a submersion and, since M \u2032\u2032 is compact, p2 |M \u2032\u2032 is a locally trivial fibration . The diagram\nM \u2032\u2032\n\np1 |M \u2032\u2032\n\n/M\n\n(3)\n\np2 |M \u2032\u2032\n\n\u000f\n\nG\nprovides a development to a Lie g-foliation F\u0303 on M having all leaves compact. Taking the\nforms u1 , . . . , ur sufficiently small, the foliation F\u0303 is C 0 -close to F.\nSecond case. H is not connected.\nIn this case, we construct the following structures:\n1. Two finite coverings maps \u03be : \u1ebc \u2192 E, \u03b7 : M\u0303 \u2192 M and a locally trivial fibration\np\u03031 : \u1ebc \u2192 M\u0303 such that the diagram\np\u03031\n\n\u1ebc\n\n/\n\nM\u0303\n\u03b7\n\n\u03be\n\n\u000f\n\np1\n\nE\nis commutative;\n2. A free action \u03c6\u0303 of G on \u1ebc such that\n\u2022 \u03be \u25e6 \u03c6\u0303g \u2261 \u03c6g \u25e6 \u03be for all g \u2208 G;\n8\n\n\u000f\n\n/M\n\n\f\u2022 p\u03031 (x) = p\u03031 (y) if and only if x and y are in the same orbit of \u03c6\u0303;\n\u2022 \u03c6\u0303 turns p\u03031 a G-principal bundle;\n3. A locally trivial fibration P\u0303 : \u1ebc \u2192 G/H0 with connected fibers such that\n\u2022 the restriction of \u03be to a fiber of P\u0303 defines a diffeomorphism with a fiber of P ;\n\u2022 P\u0303 possesses a fiber \u00d1 which projects by \u03be over N , for which\n{g \u2208 G; \u03c6\u0303g (\u00d1 ) = \u00d1 } = H0 = \u03930 .\nAfter obtaining such structures, we can consider the foliations \u03be \u2217 (G) and \u03b7 \u2217 (F) and proceed\nas in the previous case. We go on to describe such structures. Fix the leaf N = P \u22121 ([e]) of G.\nthe action\nH0 \u00d7 (G \u00d7 N ) \u2192 (G \u00d7 N )\n\u0010\n\u0011\nh0\n(h0 , (g, p))) 7\u2192\ngh\u22121\n,\n\u03c6\n(p)\n0\nis proper and free, thus, there is a unique smooth structure of H0 \\ (G \u00d7 N ) which turs the\ncanonical projection\n\u03b2 : (G \u00d7 N ) \u2192 H0 \\ (G \u00d7 N )\na principal bundle. Consider the manifold \u1ebc := H0 \\ (G \u00d7 N ) endowed with this structure. The\naction\n\u0001\n\u03c6 : H0 \\ H \u00d7 \u1ebc \u2192 \u1ebc\nh\u0010\n\u0011i\n((h), [(g, p)]) 7\u2192\ngh\u22121 , \u03c6h (p)\nh0\nis well-defined. In fact, if h\u0303 = h0 h, g\u0303 = gh\u22121\n0 and p\u0303 = \u03c6 (p), then\n\ng\u0303 h\u0303\u22121 = gh\u22121 (hh\u22121\nh\u22121 ) h\u22121 = gh\u22121 (h0 l0 )\u22121\n| 0{z } 0\nl0\u22121 \u2208H0\n\nand\n\u03c6h\u0303 (p\u0303) = \u03c6h0 hh0 (p) = \u03c6h0 hh0 h\n\n\u22121 h\n\n(p) = \u03c6h0 l0 \u25e6 \u03c6h (p).\n\nTherefore, \u03c6 is well-defined. Moreover, \u03c6 is free. Since H0 \\ H is a finite group, there is a\nunique smooth structure for \u03c6 \\ \u1ebc which turns\nq : \u1ebc \u2192 \u03c6 \\ \u1ebc\na finite Galoisian map. The map\n\u03be : \u1ebc \u2192 E\n[(g, p)] 7\u2192 \u03c6g (p)\nis well-defined and a submersion, because \u03c6 = \u03be \u25e6 \u03b2 : G \u00d7 N \u2192 E. There is a unique map\nf : \u03c6 \\ \u1ebc \u2192 E which which make the diagram bellow to commute.\n{ \u1ebc ===\n{{\n==\u03be\n{\n==\n{{\n=\u001e\n{} {\nf\n/E\n\u03c6 \\ \u1ebc\nq\n\n9\n\n\fand, thus, f is smooth. Moreover, f is bijective and this implies that \u03be : \u1ebc \u2192 E is a finite\ncovering map. Consider the free action\nH0 \u00d7 N\n\n\u2192 N\n\n(h0 , p) 7\u2192 \u03c6h0 (p)\nand the unique smooth structure of H0 \\ N which turns the canonical projection\ni : N \u2192 H0 \\ N\na principal bundle.

Consider the unique structure of \u03c8 \\ M\u0303 which turns the projection\nj : M\u0303 \u2192 \u03c8 \\ M\u0303\na fibration. Such a projection is a finite covering map, because H0 \\ H is finite. It follows from\ndefinition of \u03c6 that the map\n\u03b7 : H0 \\ N = M\u0303\n\n\u2192 M\n\n[p = (x, g)] 7\u2192 x\nis well defined. Moreover, \u03b7 is smooth, because\np1 |N = \u03b7 \u25e6 i : N \u2192 M.\nThere is an unique smooth map \u03b8 : \u03c8 \\ M\u0303 \u2192 M which make the diagram\nyy\nyy\ny\ny\ny| y\nj\n\n\u03c8 \\ M\u0303\n\nM\u0303 ?\n?\n\n?? \u03b7\n??\n??\n\u001f\n/M\n\n\u03b8\n\nto commute. This implies that \u03b8 is smooth. Moreover, \u03b8 is bijective and then \u03b7 is a finite\ncovering map. The map\np\u03031 : \u1ebc \u2192 M\u0303\n[(p, g)] 7\u2192 [p]\nis a submersion, because the diagram\n\u03b2\n\nG\u00d7N\n\n/\n\n\u1ebc\np\u03031\n\n\u000f\n\nN\n\ni\n\n10\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nM\u0303\n\n\fis commutative. Since \u1ebc is compact, we have that p\u03031 is a locally trivial fibration which make\nthe diagram of item 1 to commute and we conclude item 1. By construction, the action\n\u03c6\u0303 : G \u00d7 \u1ebc \u2192 \u1ebc\n(l, [(g, p)]) 7\u2192 [(lg, p)]\nsatisfies the conditions in item 2. The map\nP\u0303 : \u1ebc \u2192 G/H0\n[(g, p)] 7\u2192 [g]\nis well-defined and a submersion, because the diagram\nG\u00d7N\n\n\u03b2\n\n/\n\n\u1ebc\nP\u0303\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\n/ G/H0\n\nG\n\nis commutative. Since \u1ebc is compact, P\u0303 is a locally trivial fibration. We have that\n\u00d1 = {[(h0 , p)]; h0 \u2208 H0 and p \u2208 N } = P\u0303 \u22121 ([e]) = \u03b2(H0 \u00d7 N )\nis a connected set, because N is connected. Moreover, \u03be|\u00d1 : \u00d1 \u2192 N is a diffeomorphism and\n{g \u2208 G; \u03c6\u0303g (\u00d1 ) = \u00d1 } = H0 ,\nand this completes the proof.\nProof of Corollary 1. In [6], Caron and Carri\u00e8re prove that a minimal one-dimensional Lie\nfoliation on a closed manifold M n has Abelian global holonomy (see [5] for a detailed proof).\nSince the foliation is minimal, the global holonomy is dense, and thus, such foliation is a Lie\nRn\u22121 -foliation. If F\u03a9 is a (not necessarily minimal) one-dimensional Lie g-foliation on M and\nG is the simply-connected Lie group having g as Lie algebra, then, by Fedida Theorem, \u0393(\u03a9, G)\nhas Abelian Lie algebra. Since g \u00e9 semisimple and compact, G is compact and we obtain\nCorollary 1 from Theorem 1.\nTheorem 1 was obtained from a perturbation of the foliation G-i.u.t.a. on the compact\nmanifold E = M \u00d7G constructed from original Lie foliation on M . We can use the constructions\ndeveloped during the proof of Theorem 1 to obtain a fact about G-i.u.t.a. foliations:\nProposition 2. Let E be a smooth orientable closed manifold and G a G-i.u.t.a. foliation on\nE, where G is a compact Lie group. Using the notations of Proposition 1, suppose that \u03930 is\nAbelian. Then, up to a finite equivariant covering, G can be C 0 -approximated by a G-i.u.t.a.\nfoliation having all leaves compact.\nProof. We can construct \u1ebc and \u03c6\u0303 as in the proof of Theorem 1. Taking a Riemannian metric\non \u1ebc invariant by the action of G, we can proceed as in the first case in the proof of Theorem\n1 and to obtain a G-i.u.t.a. foliation on \u1ebc having all leaves compact.\n\n11\n\n\f5\n\nLie foliations on manifolds with amenable fundamental group\n\nLet A be a (discrete) group and let B(A) be the vector space of bounded real functions on A\nendowed with the sup norm. A mean on A is a left-invariant linear functional \u03b7 : B(A) \u2192 R\nsatisfying \u03b7(f ) \u2265 0 and \u03b7(1) = 1. The class of amenable groups is closed under operations of\ntaking subgroups, extensions, quotient groups and direct limits. Solvable groups are amenable.\nIn contrast, a group having a non-cyclic free subgroup is not amenable. For more details, see\n[13] and [8]. By Theorem 4.1 of [16], a finitely generated group having subexponential growth\nis amenable.\nLemma 1. Let G be a Lie group and \u0393 < G a subgroup of G. If Q is a subgroup of \u0393 such\nthat [\u0393 : Q] < \u221e, then [\u0393 : Q] \u2264 [\u0393 : Q] < \u221e.\nProof. Write \u0393/Q = {(y1 ), . . . , (yl )} and suppose, by contradiction, that [\u0393 : Q] > [\u0393 : Q] = l.\nIn this case, there are distinct elements [g1 ], . . . , [gl ], [gl+1 ] in \u0393/Q. For each k \u2208 {1, . . . , l + 1},\nthere is a sequence xkn in \u0393 which converges to gk . Taking subsequences if necessary, we can\nsuppose that (xkn ) = (yjk ) \u2208 \u0393/Q. Therefore, for each k \u2208 {1, . . . , l + 1}, there is a sequence qnk\n\u2217 gk ) \u2208 Q. There are k1 , k2 \u2208 {1, . . . , l + 1} such\nin Q such that xkn = yjk \u2217 qnk and, thus, (yj\u22121\nk\nthat k1 6= k2 and yjk1 = yjk2 = y.

If a finitely generated subgroup \u0393 < G is amenable,\nthen there is a solvable subgroup Q < \u0393 such that [\u0393 : Q] < \u221e.\nProof. Let Ad : G \u2192 GL(g, R) be the adjoint homomorphism. Since \u0393 is finitely generated,\neither Ad(\u0393) has a non-cyclic free subgroup or Ad(\u0393) is virtually solvable (Tits Alternative\n[24]). Since Ad(\u0393) is an amenable group, the first option does not occur. Therefore, there is a\nsolvable subgroup E of Ad(\u0393) such that [Ad(\u0393) : E] < \u221e. Writing T = Ad\u22121 (E), we have that\nT\n\u2243 E.\nker(Ad|T )\nSince ker(Ad|T ) < ker Ad is Abelian (G is connected), we conclude that T is solvable. Therefore,\nQ = \u0393 \u2229 T is a solvable group. Since [Ad(\u0393) : E] < \u221e, we have that [\u0393 : Q] < \u221e and the proof\nis concluded.\nProposition 3. Let M be a smooth closed manifold with amenable fundamental group and let\nF = F\u03a9 be a Lie g-foliation on M . Let G be a connected Lie group having g as Lie algebra\nand let \u0393 = \u0393(\u03a9, G) be the global holonomy of F. The connected component of \u0393 containing\nthe identity is a solvable Lie subgroup of G. In particular, if G is compact, then the connected\ncomponent of \u0393 containing the identity is Abelian.\nProof. Since \u03c01 (M ) is amenable, \u0393 is amenable. Denote by \u03930 the connected component of\n\u0393 containing the identity. Let Q be the solvable subgroup of \u0393 given by Lemma 2. Taking\nthe closure of the derived series of Q, we conclude that Q is solvable. Therefore \u03930 \u2229 Q is a\nclosed subgroup of \u03930 and a solvable group. By Lemma 1, [\u0393, Q] < \u221e and this implies that\n[\u03930 , \u03930 \u2229 Q] < \u221e. Since \u03930 is connected, we conclude that \u03930 = \u03930 \u2229 Q is solvable. Then, \u03930 is\na connected solvable Lie group. If G is compact, then \u03930 is compact and, thus, Abelian.\n12\n\n\fProof of Theorem 2. It follows from Theorem 1 and Proposition 3.\nUsing the notations of Proposition 1, we obtain\nProposition 4. Let E be a smooth orientable closed manifold with amenable fundamental group\nand let G a compact Lie group. If G is a G-i.u.t.a. foliation on E then, up to a finite equivariant\ncovering, G can be C 0 -approximated by a G-i.u.t.a. foliation having all leaves compact.\nProof. It follows from Proposition 2 and Proposition 3.\n\n6\n\nSubexponential growth and Lie foliations\n\nIn this section, we study Lie foliations on manifolds with fundamental growth of subexponential\ngrowth.\nLemma 3. Let G be a connected Lie group and \u0393 < G a finitely generated subgroup of subexponential growth. There is a nilpotent subgroup T < \u0393 such that [\u0393 : T ] < \u221e.\nProof. Since \u0393 has subexponential growth, \u0393 is amenable. Let Q < \u0393 be the solvable subgroup\ngiven by Lemma 2. Since [\u0393 : Q] < \u221e, Q is a finitely generated solvable group of subexponential\ngrowth. By Milnor-Wolf Theorem ([19], [26]) Q is virtually nilpotent, that is, there is a nilpotent\nsubgroup T of Q [Q : T ] < \u221e. We have [\u0393 : T ] < \u221e and, by Lemma 1, [\u0393 : T ] < \u221e.\nA Lie group (not necessarily connected) is compactly generated if G is generated by some\nsymmetric and compact neighborhood W of the identity of G. If W is such a neighborhood,\nwe write\nWn = W\n* * W * W} .\n| * W *{z\nn\u2212times\n\nUsing the Haar measure of G, we can consider the volume growth of G and this does not depend\non the choice of W . In particular, we say that G has polynomial volume growth if there are\nconstants c > 0 and d \u2208 N\u2217 such that \u03bc(W n ) \u2264 cnd , \u2200n \u2208 N. For more details, see [14].\n\nProposition 5. Let M be a smooth closed manifold with fundamental group of subexponential\ngrowth. If M admits a Lie g-foliation and G is a connected Lie group having g as Lie algebra,\nthen G has polynomial volume growth.\nProof. Let F = F\u03a9 be such foliation and let \u0393 = \u0393(\u03a9, F) be the global holonomy of F. Using\nFedida Fibration Theorem, we conclude that G/\u0393 is compact. By [18], \u0393 is compactly generated.\nIt follows from Theorem I.4 of [14] that G and \u0393 has the same volume growth. Let T be the\nnilpotent subgroup of \u0393 given by Lemma 3. Since [\u0393 : T ] < \u221e, T is compactly generated and\nhas the same volume growth of of \u0393 and, thus, of G. Taking the closure of the lower central\nseries of T , we obtain a central series for T and, thus T is a nilpotent group. By Theorem II.4\nof [14], T (and thus G) has polynomial volume growth.\nGiven a Lie algebra g, there is a solvable ideal of g that contains all the solvable ideals of g.\nThis ideal is called radical of g and we will denote it by r(g). We have that g is solvable if and\nonly if r(g) = g; g is semisimple if and only if r(g) = 0, that is, if and only if g has no solvable\nideal. If G is a connected Lie group having g as Lie algebra, then the radical of G is the Lie\nsubgroup of G having r(g) as Lie algebra.\n\n13\n\n\fProposition 6. Let M be a smooth closed manifold with fundamental group of subexponential\ngrowth. If M admits a Lie g-foliation, and G is a connected Lie group having g as Lie algebra,\nthen G/R is compact, where R is the radical of G.\nProof. By Proposition 5, G has polynomial volume growth. By Theorem 6.39 of [21], the adjoint\nrepresentation of g has only pure imaginary eigenvalues (see (6.35) of [21]). It follows from 6.32\nof [21] that G/R is compact.\nIn order to obtain Theorem 3 in its most general form, we use the Levi-Malcev decomposition\nfor Lie algebras [25]:\nLevi-Malcev's decomposition. Let g be a Lie algebra and r(g) \u2282 g its radical. There is a\nsemisimple subalgebra s \u2282 g such that g is a direct sum (as vector space) of s and r(g).\nA Lie subalgebra s < g given by Levi-Malvec decomposition is called it Levi factor of g. Let\nG be a connected Lie group having g as Lie algebra. If S < G is the Lie subgroup of G that\nhas s as Lie algebra, then S is called of Levi factor of G.\nLemma 4. Let F be a Lie g-foliation on a smooth manifold M and s < g a Levi factor of g.\nThere is a Lie s-foliation S on M . Each leaf of S is a F-saturated subset of M .\nProof. Consider a Levi-Malcev decomposition g = s+r(g). Take a basis {X1 , . . . , Xs } of s and a\nbasis {Xs+1 , . . . , Xq } of r(g). Let ckij be the structure constants of \u03b2 = {X1 , . . . , Xs , Xs+1 , . . . , Xq }.\nSince r(g) is an ideal of g, we have that\nif 1 \u2264 k \u2264 s and either i or j are are larger that s, then ckij = 0.\n\n(4)\n\nSince F is a Lie g-foliation, there are linearly independent forms of degree one\n\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9s , \u03c9s+1 , . . . , \u03c9q\non M which are tangent to F and satisfy the relations involving {ckij }. By (4), \u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9s define\na Lie s-foliation S on M .\nProof of Theorem 3. The first item is the Proposition 5. Let s be a Levi factor of g. By Lemma\n4, there is a Lie s-foliation on M . If S is a connected Lie group having s as Lie algebra, then S\nis semisimple. By Proposition 6, S is compact. By Theorem 1, there is a finite covering of M\nwhich fibers over S and, thus, we have item 2.\n\n7\n\nExtension to transversely homogeneous foliations\n\nProof of Theorem 4. Let g and k be the Lie algebras of G and K, respectively. By Theorem 2\nand Corollary 3.2 of [2], there are n smooth forms of degree one \u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9q , \u03c9q+1 , . . . , \u03c9n on M\nsuch that\ni. \u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9q are linearly independent at each point of M ;\nP\nii. d\u03c9k = \u2212 i<j ckij \u03c9i \u2227\u03c9j , where {ckij } are the structure constants of a basis \u03b2 = {X1 , . . . , Xn }\nof g such that Xq+1 , . . . , Xn is a basis of k.\n\n14\n\n\fPn\nConsider the form \u03a9 =\nl=1 \u03c9l Xl of degree one on M with values in g and let \u03b1 be the\nMaurer-Cartan form of G. Consider the form \u0398 on M \u00d7 G with values in g given by\n\u0398(x,g) (u, v) = \u03a9(x)u \u2212 \u03b1(g)v,\nas in Darboux-Fedida Theorem. The form \u03a9 is singular in M , however, the form \u0398 has rank n in\neach point of M \u00d7G. Therefore, as in Darboux-Fedida's Theorem, \u0398 induces a foliation G-i.u.t.a.\nG on M \u00d7 G whose dimension is the dimension of M . Let p2 : M \u00d7 G \u2192 G and \u03c0 : G \u2192 G/K\nbe the canonical projections. By (i), if M \u2032 is a leaf of G, the map \u03c0 \u25e6 p2 |M \u2032 : M \u2032 \u2192 G/K is\na submersion. Then, we can follow the proof of Theorem 1 and use the Theorem 2 to obtain\nTheorem 4.\nProof of Corollary 2. By Corollary 2.1 of [3], the fundamental group of M has polynomial\nvolume growth. Then, the first statement follows from Theorem 4. In the case q = 1, suppose\nthat the global holonomy \u0393 of F is not finite. Since \u03930 is Abelian, then \u03930 contains (a subgroup\nof SO(3) isomorphic to) SO(2). We have that\nSO(3) % \u0393 \u2283 \u03930 \u2283 SO(2).\nTherefore, either \u0393 = SO(2) or \u0393 = O(2). It follows from construction in Theorem 1 that, in\nthe first case, the finite covering mentioned is the identity and, in the second case, it has two\nfolds.\n\n8\n\nA remark about Riemannian foliations\n\nThis section is concerned with the study of Riemannian foliations and contains results already\nfound in [22]. Let M be a smooth manifold and F a smooth foliation on M of codimension q.\nDenote by X (F) the set of smooth vector fields on M which are tangent to F. We say that a\nvector field X on M is foliated with respect to F if\n[X, Y ] \u2208 X (F),\n\nfor all Y \u2208 X (F).\n\nIf N F is the normal bundle of F and X is a foliated vector field, we can project X over\nN F, obtaining a vector field X tangent to N F. We say that X is the transversal vector field\nassociated with X. We say that a foliation F is transversely parallelizable if its normal bundle\nadmits a trivialization by q linearly independent transversal foliated vector fields. Every Lie\nfoliation is a transversely parallelizable foliation, however, the reciprocal is not necessarily true.\nWe say that a Riemannian metric g on M is bundle-like with respect to a foliation F if,\ngiven an open U \u2282 M and foliated vector fields X, Y on U orthogonal to the leaves of F, the\nfunction g(X, Y ) is constant along the leaves of F|U . For all details, see [20]. We say that F\nis a Riemannian foliation if there exists a bundle-like metric with respect to F. A deep result\ndue to Molino describes the structure of transversely parallelizable and Riemannian foliations\nand proves that the study of such foliations is closely related to the study of Lie foliations:\nMolino's structure theorem ([12, 20]). Let M be a connected closed manifold and let F be\na foliation on M .\n1. If F is transversally parallelizable, then the closures of the leaves of F are the fibers of\na locally trivial basic fibration \u03c0 : M \u2192 B. The restriction of F to each fiber defines a\nLie g-foliation with dense leaves. The Lie algebra g is an algebraic invariant of F called\nstructural Lie algebra of F.\n15\n\n\f2. If F is a transversally orientable Riemannian foliation and \u03c4 : M \u2032 \u2192 M is the principal SO(q)-bundle of orthonormal frames transverse to F, then F lifts to a transversally\nparallelizable foliation F \u2032 on M \u2032 such that\n\u2022 dim F \u2032 = dim F;\n\u2022 F \u2032 is invariant by the action of SO(q).\nThe structural Lie algebra of F \u2032 is an invariant of F called structural Lie algebra of F.\nBased on Molino Theorem, we obtain the following:\nProposition 7. Let M be a smooth closed manifold and let F be a Riemannian foliation on\nM . If the fundamental group of M is amenable, then the structural Lie algebra of F is solvable.\nProof. Let\n***\n\n/ \u03c02 (M )\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\n/ \u03c01 (SO(q))\n\n\u03c8\n\n/ \u03c01 (M \u2032 )\n\n/ \u03c01 (M )\n\n/ ***\n\nbe the homotopy exact sequence associated with the principal SO(q)-bundle of orthonormal\nframes transverse to F. We have that ker \u03c8 = Im\u03c6 is Abelian and thus amenable. Moreover,\nIm\u03c8 is a subgroup of \u03c01 (M ) and thus it is amenable. Since\n\u03c01 (M \u2032 )/ ker \u03c8 \u2243 Im\u03c8,\nwe conclude that \u03c01 (M \u2032 ) is amenable, because amenable groups are closed to extensions. Let\n\u03c0 : M \u2032 \u2192 B the locally trivial basic fibration of F \u2032 and let N = \u03c0 \u22121 (y) be a fibre of \u03c0. From\nhomotopy exact sequence\n***\n\n/ \u03c02 (B)\n\n\u03c6\n\n/ \u03c01 (N )\n\n\u03c6\n\n/ \u03c01 (M \u2032 )\n\n\u03c8\n\n/ \u03c01 (B)\n\n/ ***\n\nof \u03c0, we have that Im\u03c6 = ker \u03c8 is a subgroup of \u03c01 (M \u2032 ), so it is amenable. Moreover, Im\u03c6 =\nker \u03c6 is an Abelian group, so it is amenable. Since\n\u03c01 (N )/ ker \u03c6 \u2243 Im\u03c6,\nwe conclude that \u03c01 (N ) is amenable. From Molino Theorem, F induces a minimal Lie gfoliation on N . Let G be a connected lie group having g as Lie algebra. By Fedida theorem,\nthe global holonomy of F is dense in G. It follows from Proposition 3 that the structural Lie\nalgebra of F is solvable.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Behague and B. Sc\u00e1rdua Foliations invariant under Lie group transverse actions.\nMonatsh.
