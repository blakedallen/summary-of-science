However, its application is severely limited by measurement obstacles. We show\nthat fluctuations in type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) fluxes induced by LSPV offer a promising approach\nto measure LSPV at intermediate redshifts.

Measurements which rely on distance indicators to subtract Hubble flow [1] are limited to local universe. Those based on\nanisotropic galaxy clustering in redshift space can be extended to cosmological distances [2]. However, this does\nrely on modeling of galaxy redshift distortion, whose accuracy still requires much improvement in this era of precision cosmology [3]. The kinetic SZ (KSZ) effect [4] of\nclusters is a promising probe [5], although systematic errors do exist [6]. Statistics of the diffuse KSZ background,\nsuch as the power spectrum [7] and cross correlations\nwith other tracers of the large scale structure [8] can be\nmeasured robustly. However, this background measures\nthe peculiar momentum instead and thus probes LSPV\nonly indirectly.\nLSPV, as a direct tracer of gravitational potential at\ncosmological scales, is powerful to probe dark matter,\ndark energy [9] and gravity [10]. In fact, it is indispensable to distinguish between some scenarios on the dark\nsectors [11]. We show that it is promising to measure\nLSPV robustly through type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and\nopen a new window into the dark universe.\nPeculiar velocity of a SN at position ~x shifts the apparent redshift to 1 + z = (1 + z\u0304)(1 + ~v * x\u0302), where z\u0304 is\nthe real redshift. It also changes the luminosity distance\nto dL (z) = d \u0304L (z\u0304)(1 + 2~v * x\u0302). Fluctuations induced in its\nflux (with respect to the mean flux at z, instead of at z\u0304)\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: pjzhang@shao.ac.cn,xuelei@cosmology.bao.ac.cn\n\nis then [12]\n\u03b4Fv (~x) = Q(z)~v * x\u0302; Q(z) = \u22122(1 \u2212\n\n1+z\n).\n\u03c7H\n\n(1)\n\nRHere, H is the Hubble constant at redshift z and \u03c7 =\ndz/H is the comoving distance. We have neglected\nthe earth motion, whose effect is straightforward to take\ninto account. The signal \u03b4Fv \u223c v/(cz) is contaminated\nby \u03b4FL induced by gravitational lensing1 and \u03b4Frandom induced by SN Ia intrinsic fluctuations. \u03b4Frandom is spatially\nuncorrelated and straightforward to correct. \u03b4FL induces\nsystematical errors in velocity measurement, however, at\nlocal universe where z < 0.1, contaminations of \u03b4FL are\n\u22124\nL 2\nnegligible (h(\u03b4Fv )2 i >\n\u223c 10 \u226b h(\u03b4F ) i). These properties\nhave enabled success in local LSPV measurements [14].\nGravitational lensing induced systematical error increases with redshift, while the signal decreases. So eventually the lensing induced systematical error will overwhelm the signal at intermediate redshifts. For example,\nL\nat z \u223c 0.5, \u03b4Fv \u223c 0.1% <\n\u223c \u03b4F . If not corrected, this\nwill prohibit the application of SNe Ia as cosmic speed\ncensors. However, as the main result of this paper, we\nwill show that, lensing induced systematical error has a\nintrinsically different pattern to that of \u03b4Fv and can be effectively corrected in the 3D Fourier space. On the other\nhand, shot noise induced by SNe Ia intrinsic fluctuations,\nwhich is the dominant statistical error, can be overcome\nby advance in observations. This approach does not rely\non assumptions on SN Ia absolute luminosity, other than\nthat its rms fluctuation is small, since it only explores\ninformation imprinted in flux fluctuations. Eventually,\n\n1\n\nDust extinction also causes fluctuations in SN fluxes. This kind\nof fluctuations has opposite sign to that of gravitational lensing and thus suppresses contaminations in velocity measurement.\nFor cosmic gray dust, contaminations can be suppressed by 1050% [13].\n\n\f2\nhigh precision mapping of the motion of the dark universe to z \u223c 0.5 will be realized through SNe Ia.\nFor a narrow redshift bin, \u03b4Fv and \u03b4FL are virtually uncorrelated, due to the cancellation of positive v and negative v and the lensing weighting function. We then have\nh\u03b4F (~x1 )\u03b4F (~x2 )i = 4w\u03ba (~x1 , ~x2 ) + Q2 (z)\u03bev (~x1 , ~x1 ). Here,\nthe direct observable is the total flux fluctuation (the\nsum of three)\n\u03b4F = \u03b4Fv + \u03b4FL + \u03b4Frandom .\n\n(2)\n\nw\u03ba (~x1 , ~x2 ) \u2261 h\u03ba(~x1 )\u03ba(~x2 )i and \u03bev (~x1 ) \u2261 h~v (~x1 ) * x\u03021~v (~x2 ) *\nx\u03022 i are the correlation functions of \u03ba and ~v (~x) * x\u0302, respectively. \u03ba is the lensing convergence of a SN Ia at position\n~x and \u03b4FL = 2\u03ba in the weak lensing regime. w\u03ba (~x1 , ~x2 ) is\nanisotropic with respect to ~x1 \u2212 ~x2 2 . It depends primarily on ~\u03b812 , the angular separation of two lines of sight\n(l.o.s.). The 2D Fourier transform over ~\n\u03b812 (under the\nflat sky approximation) gives the usual 2D lensing power\nspectrum Cl\u03ba (x1 , x2 ). On the other hand, w\u03ba (~x1 , ~x2 ) only\nweakly depends on x1 \u2212x2 , the radial separation along the\nl.o.s.. Namely w\u03ba lacks small scale power along the l.o.s.\n\u03ba ~\nCorrespondingly, the 3D power spectrum P3D\n(k), which\nis the 3D Fourier transform of w\u03ba , is highly anisotropic\nin the 3D wavevector ~k space. Its power should concentrate on a 2D plane of ~k perpendicular to the l.o.s.,\nwhile its power along the l.o.s. can be significantly supv ~\npressed. On the other hand, P3D\n(k), which is the 3D\npower spectrum of v\u0302 * x\u0302, has the opposite behavior. Its\npower concentrates along the l.o.s.. This brings hope to\nv ~\nmeasure P3D\n(k) along the l.o.s..\nTHE 3D FLUX FLUCTUATION POWER\nSPECTRUM\n\nIn the appendix, we derive the analytical expression of\n\u03ba ~\nv ~\nthe 3D power spectra P3D\n(k) and P3D\n(k). These results\napply to survey volume in a narrow redshift range [z \u2212\n\u2206z/2, z + \u2206z/2] and sufficiently small sky area \u03b8max \u00d7\n\u03b8max . We require \u2206z \u226a z and \u03b8max /2 \u226a 90\u25e6 and choose\nthe coordinate such that the center of the survey volume\nis ~xc = (0, 0, xc ). For the small sky coverage adopted, the\nl.o.s. is close to the direction to the survey center, which\nwe denote with subscript k. The directions perpendicular\nto the direction to the survey center are denoted with\nsubscript \u22a5. Here we summarize the results.\n\n2\n\nDuring preparation of this work, A. Vallinotto et al. [15] and L.\nHui et al. [16] published works on 3D lensing correlation function. Especially in [16] and a pioneer work [17] by T. Matsubara\nthat [16] pointed out, the anisotropy in the correlation function\nw\u03ba (~\nx1 , ~\nx2 ) is explicitly calculated. The result presented in this\npaper is performed in Fourier space, complementary to theirs\nand particularly suitable for LSPV reconstruction that this paper focuses on. Recently, Hui et al. [18] published their result in\nFourier space, which is consistent with ours.\n\nFIG. 1: The 3D power spectrum variance of SNe Ia flux flucv ~\ntuations, which is the sum of \u22062v (~k) \u2261 Q2 (z)k3 P3D\n(k)/(2\u03c0 2 )\n2 ~\n3 \u03ba ~\n2\n(solid lines) and \u2206L (k) \u2261 4k P3D (k)/(2\u03c0 ) (dot lines), at\nz \u2208 [0.45, 0.55]. k is in unit of h/Mpc. Gravitational lensing lacks small scale power along the l.o.s., which causes the\noscillating features. The same reason causes significant suppression in \u22062L (~k) at kk \u226b 2\u03c0/\u2206x, where LSPV can be measured accurately in a model independent way. When kk \u2192 0,\n\u22062L (~k) is barely suppressed and \u22062v (~k) can not be measured\nfor these modes. \u22062L begins to increase where k\u22a5 \u2192 0, caused\n\u03ba\nby its dependence on Cl=k\n.

By subtracting it from the mea\u03ba\nsured flux power spectrum, the systematic error P3D\nis\nconverted into statistical error and one obtains an unbiv\nased measure of P3D\n(Fig. 1).\nOne still needs to overcome SNe Ia intrinsic fluctuations, which induce the dominant statistical error,\nv\n\u2206P3D\n\u2243\nv\nP3D\n\nq\n\n2\n\u03c3intr\n(2\u03c0)2\nk2 \u2206kf\u03a9 V n\u0304SN \u22062v 2\u03c0 2 /k3\n\u22123\n\n\u22126\n\n\u03c3intr 2 3\u00d710\nk 3/2 10\n)\n= 0.4( 0.05\nn\u0304SN ( 0.1 )\n\u22062\n\nv\n\n9\n\n( 10\nV\n\n(7)\nk\n1/2\n\u2206kf\u03a9 )\n\n.\n\nHere, f\u03a9 is the fractional solid angle of k modes used for\nthe analysis. 10% rms flux fluctuation (\u03c3intr = 0.1) corresponds to roughly 0.1 mag rms dispersion in magnitude.\nBetter calibration of SNe Ia and improvement over survey noise are likely able to reduce \u03c3intr [19]. A factor of 2\ndecrease in \u03c3intr would relax the requirement of n\u0304SN by a\nfactor of 4 or the sky coverage by a factor of 16. Otherwise, successful measurement of LSPV requires (1) large\nsky coverage fsky \u223c 1 and (2) high SN number density\nn\u0304SN \u223c 10\u22123 (h/Mpc)3 . There are no fundamental obstacles to reach the above goals. The SNe Ia rate at z = 0.5\nis \u2243 10\u22124 (h/Mpc)3 /yr [20, 21]. So the survey must be\nperformed over decades to reach n\u0304SN \u223c 10\u22123 (h/Mpc)3 .\nDrift scan using many telescopes of large field of view\nis able to detect all SNe Ia over a significant fraction of\nthe sky. With advance in technology, such survey can\nbe feasible and economical [22]. Follow up measurement\non these \u223c 106 spectroscopic redshifts is also feasible,\nsince low resolution spectroscopy with \u03c3v \u223c 300 km/s\n\nsuffices. Even for these surveys, the LSPV measurement\nwill be still limited to directions with sufficiently large\nkk , however, such measurements contain full information\non the 3D power spectrum of ~v (not only ~v * x\u0302), since it is\nisotropic in ~k space. Furthermore, since the power of the\nvelocity power spectrum variance peaks at k \u223c 0.1h/Mpc\nfor the standard cosmology, the bulk information of velocities can be measured.\nMeasuring LSPV through SNe Ia requires ambitious\nimprovement over currently proposed SNe Ia surveys. It\nthus requires strong justification. Here we briefly address\nsome impacts of such measurement on precision cosmology. For cosmology based on general relativity, dark matter and smooth dark energy, LSPV measurement helps to\nbreak parameter degeneracies. For example, the strength\nof weak gravitational lensing increases with dark matter\ndensity \u03a9m , because of more lens mass, and \u03c38 , because\nof stronger density fluctuations. Thus there exists a degeneracy between \u03a9m and \u03c38 . This degeneracy can be\nbroken by the lensing tomography, through which one\ncan infer the evolution of the matter density field, which\nis more sensitive to \u03a9m than to \u03c38 .3 On the other hand,\nLSPV is very useful to break this degeneracy, since the\nstrength of LSPV is very sensitive to evolution in the\nmatter density field. A simple justification is as follows. In the linear regime, from the continuity equation\n\u03b4\u0307 + \u2207 * ~v = 0, we have v(~k, z) \u221d f \u03b4(~k, z) in the Fourier\nspace, where f \u2243 \u03a9m (z)0.56 . With the measurement of\n\u03b4(~k, z) (or the power spectrum Pm (k)) from weak lensing and LSPV measurement, one can directly infer f (z)\nand thus the value of \u03a9m to break the \u03a9m -\u03c38 degeneracy in weak lensing cosmology. LSPV information is also\nhighly complementary to CMB. The strength of CMB is\nsensitive to the shape and amplitude of the initial fluctuations. LSPV measurement directly provides such kind of\ninformation and can thus significantly improve the CMB\ncosmological constraints. For other applications, refer to\n[9].\nIf our universe is indeed fully described by general\nrelativity (GR), dark matter and smooth dark energy,\ncosmological probes other than LSPV can already put\nstringent constraints on dark matter density, dark energy density and the dark energy equation of state [24].\nIn this case, LSPV measurement does not provide fundamentally new information, due to the fixed (and known)\nrelations between fluctuations in the metric, density and\nLSPV in such cosmology. However, the dark universe can\nbe more complicated. If we are open to the possibilities\nthat dark energy may be clustered, with non-negligible\nanisotropic stree, and gravity at cosmological scales may\ndeviate from GR, LSPV containes independent and cru-\n\n3\n\nIn the linear regime, the matter density evolution does not depend on \u03c38 . But in the nonlinear regime, it does.\n\n\f4\ncial information to that in flucutations of metric and density field. LSPV measurement can thus provide valuable\ninformation, such as the nature of gravity at cosmological scales [10]. Indeed, to distinguish between some dark\nenergy models from some modified gravity models, it is\nindispensable to have LSPV measurements, as shown in\n[11].\nThere are several ways of measuring LSPV. LSPV\nmeasurement through SNe Ia is complementary to other\nmethods. Among them, a promising one is the kinetic\nSunyaev Zel'dovich (KSZ) effect of galaxy clusters. Ongoing and planned surveys such as the south pole telescope (SPT)4 plus the dark energy surveys (DES)5 are\nable to measure the LSPV power spectrum to 10% statistical accuracy at large scales [5, 6]. Future all sky surveys can further reduce the statistical error by a factor\nof 3. However, what the cluster KSZ effect directly measures is the total KSZ flux \u221d Mg v, instead of v. Here\nMg is the total gas mass. Some complexities, such as\nfeedback, cooling, point source contamination and nonisothermal/non-spherical gas distribution, could bias the\nestimation on Mg [6] and thus bias the LSPV measurement through the cluster KSZ effect. On the other hand,\nLSPV measurement through SNe Ia is free of such uncertainties, althrough it may suffer some other systematics.\nFor example, if the intrinsic SNe Ia fluctuations are somehow correlated with the large scale structure (although\nquite unlikely), LSPV measurements will be biased by\nsuch correlation. Nonetheless, SNe Ia provide an independent, likely clean and potentially powerful method to\nmeasure LSPV. For all these reasons, surveys capable of\nmeasuring LSPV through SNe Ia would be very profitable\nscientifically.\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\nThroughout the paper we adopt the flat sky approximation, which breaks where l = k\u22a5 xc \u2192 0 (k\u22a5 \u2192 0).\nHowever, we will show in a companion paper that, the\nfeature that the power of \u03b4FL is significantly suppressed\nalong the l.o.s. survives beyond the flat sky approximation and so as the proposed LSPV measurement method.\nThe same technique can be applied to fluctuations in\nthe fundamental plane relation of galaxies, for which peculiar velocity also contributes. Dispersion in the fundamental plane is larger than that of in SNe Ia. However,\nhigher galaxy number density may be reached in shorter\nobservation period and the overall shot noise can be reduced.\n\n4\n5\n\nhttp://pole.uchicago.edu/\nhttp://www.darkenergysurvey.org/\n\nAs the summary, this paper shows in a proof of concept study that contaminations induced by gravitational\nlensing in SN peculiar velocity measurements can be efficiently and unbiasedly corrected in 3D Fourier space.\nCombining with advance in SNe Ia surveys, it is feasible\nto measure the large scale peculiar velocity robustly and\nmap the motion of the dark universe.\nWe thank Neal Dalal, Yipeng Jing and Zheng Zheng\nfor useful discussions.
