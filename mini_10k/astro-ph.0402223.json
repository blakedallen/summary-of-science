Introduction\nWave activity of the solar corona attracts attention in\nrelation with coronal heating and solar wind acceleration problems, and as an efficient tool for MHD coronal\nseismology (e.g. Nakariakov 2003). The observational evidence of coronal waves and oscillations is abundant. Low\nperiod coronal oscillations, in the range between a few\nseconds to several minutes, are believed to be associated\nwith magnetohydrodynamic waves. In particular, propagating slow magnetoacoustic waves have been identified\nin polar plumes (Ofman, Nakariakov & DeForest 1999)\nand over loop footpoints (Nakariakov et al. 2000, Tsiklauri\n& Nakariakov 2001), and standing global slow modes in\nloops (Ofman & Wang 2002). The majority of confidently\ninterpreted examples of the coronal wave activity has been\nfound in the EUV coronal emission.\nObservations in other spectral windows, in particular\nin the radio band, also demonstrate various kinds of oscillations (e.g., the quasi-periodic pulsations, or QPP, see\nAschwanden 1987 for a review), usually with periods from\na few seconds to several tens of seconds. It is commonly\naccepted that the waves with periods about several seconds may be produced by either propagating or standing\nsausage modes (Roberts, Edwin & Benz 1984; Nakariakov,\nMelnikov & Reznikova 2003, Aschwanden, Nakariakov &\nSend offprint requests to: V.M. Nakariakov,\ne-mail: valery@astro.warwick.ac.uk\n\u22c6\nPresent address: Joule Physics Laboratory, School of\nComputing, Science and Engineering, University of Salford,\nSalford, M5 4WT, UK\n\nMelnikov 2004). However, it is known that the existence\nof the non-leaky sausage mode cut-off imposes an upper\nlimit on the possible wave periods: waves with the periods\nlonger than the cut-off period cannot be trapped in the\nloops. For a magnetic cylinder of the radius a, the cut-off\nperiod Pc is estimated (see, e.g. Roberts et al. 1984) as\n2.62a\nPc \u2248\nCAe\n\ns\n\n2 \u2212 C2\nCAe\nA0\n2 + C2 ,\nCs0\nA0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Cs0 is the sound speed in the loop, and CA0 and\nCAe are the Alfv\u00e9n speeds inside and outside the slab,\nrespectively. For example, for typical flaring loop parameters a = 6 Mm, CA0 = 1 Mm/s, CAe = 3CA0 and\nCs0 = 0.5 Mm/s, the cut-off period is about 15 s, and\nit is difficult to make it greater than 20 s. However, Xray band observations often give much longer periodicities, frequently in association with a flare. For example,\nperiodicities from 20 s to 25 min have been presented by\nHarrison (1987), McKenzie & Mullan (1997) and Terekhov\net al. (2002). Similar periodicities have been observed in\nthe decimeter and microwave bands. In particular, Wang\n& Xie (2000) observed QPP with the periods of about\n50 s at 1.42 and 2 GHz (in association with an M4.4 Xray flare). The coincidence of QPP periods observed in the\nX-ray and in radio bands is not a surprise, as the higher\nfrequency radio bursts are found to correlate very well\nwith X-ray bursts (e.g., Benz & Kane 1986). Moreover,\npulsations with the periods significantly greater than the\nestimated sausage mode cut-off period have been found\n\n\f2\n\nNakariakov et al.: Acoustic Oscillations in Solar and Stellar Flaring Loops\n\nin both hard X-ray and microwave bands simultaneously\n(e.g. Fu, Liu & Li 1996, Tian, Gao & Fu 1999).\nSimilar oscillations, with the period of 220 s, have\nrecently been observed in the white-light emission associated with stellar flaring loops (Mathioudakis et al.\n2003). Possibly, the 160 s periodic oscillations observed by\nHoudebine et al. (1993) during a flare on Ad-Leonis and\n26 and 13 s coherent oscillations observed by Zhilyaev et\nal. (2000) in EV Lac flares have the same nature.\nA possible interpretation of these medium period\nQPPs may be connected with kink or torsional modes\n(Zaitsev & Stepanov 1989). However, these modes are\npractically incompressible and, in the case of a small amplitude, the produced perturbation of the magnetic field\nis also very weak. (E.g., the direct observations of kink\nmodes in EUV, Aschwanden et al. 1999, Nakariakov et al.\n1999). Thus, it is not simple to link these weak perturbations of the magnetic field with observed QPPs.\nIn this study, we suggest an alternative mechanism for\nthe generation of long-period QPPs. We demonstrate that\nin a coronal loop an impulsive energy release generates\nthe second spatial harmonics of the acoustic mode. These\noscillations are of high quality and do not experience dissipation. This mode, producing noticeable perturbations\nof the loop density and generating field-aligned flows, is\nshown to be responsible for QPP with medium and long\nperiods.\n\n2. The model\nWe describe plasma dynamics in a coronal loop by solving\nnumerically 1D radiative hydrodynamic equations (infinite magnetic field approximation) that resemble closely\nthe Naval Research Laboratory Solar Flux Tube Model\n(SOLFTM, Mariska 1987). The numerical code that we\nuse is a 1D version of Lagrangian Re-map code (Arber et\nal. 2001) with the radiative loss limiters. As in SOLFTM\nthe coronal loop is connected with a dense, cold (104 K), 5\nMm thick plasma region, that mimics the chromosphere,\nand which because of its large density provides sufficient\namount of matter to fill the loop during the flare. The\nmodel includes: the effects of gravitational stratification,\nheat conduction, radiative losses, added external heat input, the presence of Helium, non-linearity, and Braginskii\nbulk viscosity. For the radiative loss function we use the\nform given in (Rosner et al. 1978) extended to a wider\ntemperature range (Peres et al. 1982, Priest 1982).\nWe performed a series of numerical runs simulating\nthe response of the loop to a flare-like impulsive heat deposition at a chosen location. The heat deposition was\nmodelled by the function\nEH (s, t) = ES (s)ET (t) =\n(2)\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n(t \u2212 tp )2\n(s \u2212 s0 )2\n1\n+\nQ\nexp\n\u2212\n,\nE0 exp \u2212\np\n2\u03c3s2\n2\u03c3t2\nwhere, ES (s) and ET (t) were spatial and temporal parts\nof the heating function. E0 is the amplitude in units of\n\nFig. 1. Time evolution of the average temperature (upper\npanel) and the number density at apex (lower panel) in\nthe flaring loop in the case of apex heating. The upper\ncurves correspond to longer flares and the lower to the\nshorter flares. The vertical straight lines show the time\ninterval of particularly distinct oscillations on the upper\ncurve.\n\nerg cm\u22123 s\u22121 ; s0 is the position of the maximum heat\ndeposition; \u03c3s is the heat deposition localization scale.\nFunction (2) allows us to model spatial and temporal profiles of the heat deposition separately. As it is discussed\nbelow, the results are weakly dependent upon the particular choice of this function. The only restriction is the\nspatial and temporal characteristic scales to be shorter\nthan the loop length and the acoustic transit time along\nthe loop, respectively.\nIn the numerical runs presented here, the size of the\nheat deposition region is \u03c3s = 7 Mm. The flare peak time\nis fixed in at 2200 s. The heat deposition duration, \u03c3t , is\nvariable, from 42 s to 333 s. The heating amplitude Qp is\nfixed at 2 \u00d7 104 , while E0 is fixed at 0.004 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 .\nThe loop length is taken to be 55 Mm. We keep the coronal\npart of the loop initially at a temperature of 1 MK and at\na mass density of \u03c1 = \u03bcmp ne = 6.6\u00d710\u221216 g cm\u22123 (at the\nloop apex), for a helium-to-hydrogen number density ratio\nof 0.05, i.e., with the mean molecular weight \u03bc = 1.1. This\ncorresponds to an electron density of ne = 3.6 \u00d7 108 cm\u22123 .\nIn our approach, specific initial conditions in region connecting corona to the chromosphere and chromosphere itself have little or no effect on the corona dynamics as they\nare rapidly modified, self-consistently, according to the radiative hydrodynamics equations. Resolution in all numerical runs was fixed at 1000 grid points, which were distributed non-uniformly in order to properly resolve strong\ngradients in the transition region. Even tripling the number of grid points does not alter the numerical results, thus\nassuring full convergence of the simulation.\n\n\fNakariakov et al.: Acoustic Oscillations in Solar and Stellar Flaring Loops\n\n3\n\n3. Acoustic second standing harmonics\nThe typical loop evolution is shown in Figure 1. The impulsively heated loop responds with an increase of the\ntemperature. The particular response is determined by the\nduration of the heat deposition \u03c3t . In Fig. 1 the cases of\n\u03c3t = 42 s and 333 s are presented. The chromospheric\nevaporation increases loop density with up-flows of the\norder of a hundred km s\u22121 . Then, during the peak of\nthe flare, the combined action of the heat input and the\nconductive and radiate losses, yields an oscillatory flow\npattern with typical amplitudes of up to few tens of km\ns\u22121 . In the cooling phase, the matter drains out of the\nloop exhibiting oscillations; and the loop finally reaches\nan equilibrium.\nIn the context of this study, the most interesting feature in Fig. 1 is the clear quasi-periodic oscillations of\nthe density time-profiles, especially about and after the\npeak of the flare. This behaviour closely resembles the\nradio and X-ray flaring light-curves (see the citations in\nIntroduction).\nTypical time-distance plots of the evolution of the density and the velocity are shown in Figure 2. Here, the slow,\nin comparison with the oscillation period, aperiodic variations of the density and the velocity are subtracted. The\nvelocity perturbation clearly demonstrates the node near\nthe apex, while the density perturbation is maximal there\n(anti-node). This behaviour is consistent with the second\nstanding acoustic mode,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0Cs\nt sin\ns ,\nL\nL\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0Cs\n2\u03c0\nA\u03c10\nsin\nt cos\ns ,\n\u03c1(s, t) = \u2212\nCs\nL\nL\nVx (s, t) = A cos\n\n\u0012\n\nFig. 2.

(3)). Perturbations\nof the density are in phase at both points of measurement.\nThe oscillations are quasi-harmonic, with a well-defined\nperiod. In the discussed case, the period of the oscillation\nis 64 s. According to Eqs. (3), the period of the second spatial harmonic should be P = L/Cs . The practical formula\nfor the determination of the oscillation period is\np\nP/s \u2248 6.7 \u00d7 (L/Mm)/ (T /MK)\n(5)\n\nwhere T is the average temperature in the loop. (This\nexpression is a particular case of the general formula suggested by Roberts et al. (1984), who pointed out that the\nsecond standing harmonic could likely be excited in coronal loops.) Substituting the loop length L = 55 Mm (see\n\nFig. 3. Time signatures of the velocity and density perturbations outputted at the points \u22126 Mm (top panel) and\n+6 Mm (bottom panel) of the loop length for the same\ntime interval as Fig 2. The solid curve shows the plasma\nnumber density in units of 1011 cm\u22123 . The dashed line\ngives the velocity normalized to 400 km s\u22121 . Here, the\nslow variations of the density and the velocity are subtracted.\n\nFig. 2) and the average temperature, 25 MK (see top left\npanel in Fig. 1 in the range of 2500\u20132800 s), we obtain\n73.7 s, which is reasonably close to the result of the simulations. The discrepancy of about 15% is explained by the\nfact that the actual reflection points are situated over the\nloop footpoints (see Fig. 2) because of stratification. This\nreduces slightly the effective length of the loop and, consequently the resonant period of the mode. However, as the\nuncertainty in the observational determination of the loop\nlength is comparable with this error, formula (5) provides\na satisfactory estimation of the oscillation period.\n\n\f4\n\nNakariakov et al.: Acoustic Oscillations in Solar and Stellar Flaring Loops\n\n4. Conclusions\nWe suggest that the second standing acoustic mode may\nbe responsible for QPP with periods of about 10\u2013300 s (estimated by Eq. (3)) observed in solar and stellar flare light\ncurves. This mechanism is similar to the interpretation of\ncoronal loop oscillations observed with SUMER, proposed\nby Ofman & Wang (2002). The main new element in our\nstudy is connected with the mode excitation. We demonstrate that the second standing acoustic harmonic appears\nas a natural response of the loop to an impulsive energy\ndeposition. The SUMER oscillations are likely to be associated with some other excitation mechanism, as only\na small fraction of SUMER oscillations are observed in\nassociation with solar flares (Wang et al. 2003).\nTraditionally, the acoustic wave interpretation was excluded as these waves were supposed to be highly dissipative. However, numerical simulations discussed above, as\nwell as recently gained abundant observational evidence of\nthe presence of acoustic waves in the solar corona, suggest\nthat the observed periodicities can be associated with this\nmode. The physical mechanism responsible for the induction of the quasi-periodic pulsations can be understood in\nterms of auto-oscillations generated by an electric-circuit\ngenerator. Indeed, the physical system modelled here contains all the necessary ingredients of a generator: the DC\npower supply (thermal instability), the nonlinear element\n(the plasma) and the resonator (the loop). This may explain why the oscillations may be observed to be dissipationless. However, proper analytical theory of the excitation of this mode is still to be developed.\nThe oscillation period is determined by the ratio of the\nloop length and the average sound speed in the loop. The\ntypical amplitude of the density and velocity perturbations is 2-10% of the background. This value is consistent\nwith observed amplitudes of X-ray QPPs (McKenzie &\nMullan 1997). However, the observed amplitudes of radioband QPPs are sometimes higher. This discrepancy\nwould be resolved by taking into account the specific\nmechanism responsible for the modulation of radio emission, and the line-of-sight angle (e.g. Cooper, Nakariakov\n& Williams 2003). In certain condition, the modulation\nmechanism can amplify the pulsations up to the observable level.\nThe model developed here is quite approximate, as it\ndoes not take into account two-dimensional MHD effects\nsuch as centrifugal force and the perturbation of the loop\ncross-section. However, we believe that the neglected effects do not change the qualitative picture described here\nand that Eq. (5) gives a correct estimation for the oscillation period.\nFinally, we would like to emphasize that the generation of the second spatial harmonic of an acoustic wave,\nby means of which we try to explain the observed quasiperiodic oscillations in flaring loops, is a consistent feature,\nseen for a wide range of physical parameters, including the\ncase of non-symmetric heating functions. More detailed\nanalysis will be presented elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgements.
