The physics program includes the\ncomplement of the results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [2] and the discovery of\npossible signatures of physics beyond the standard model (SM). Since supersymmetry\nis often considered as the main candidate for new physics, the precise resolution of the\nsupersymmetric model is one of the essential goals of the ILC [3].\nAn interesting possibility for the determination of the supersymmetric model is to\nstudy the gaugino/higgsino particles, which are expected to be among the lightest supersymmetric particles. In this paper we consider two basic supersymmetric models:\nthe minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM). The MSSM contains four neutralinos \u03c7\u03030i , which\nare mixtures of the photino, zino and neutral higgsinos, and two charginos \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\ni , being mixtures of wino and charged higgsino. The neutralino/chargino sector depends\nat tree level on four parameters: the U(1) and SU(2) gaugino masses M1 and M2 , the\nhiggsino mass parameter \u03bc, and the ratio tan \u03b2 of the vacuum expectation values of\nthe Higgs fields. For the determination of these parameters, straightforward strategies\n[4, 5] have been worked out even if only the light neutralinos and charginos \u03c7\u030301 , \u03c7\u030302 and\n\u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 are kinematically accessible at the first stage of the ILC [6].\nThe NMSSM [7] is the simplest extension of the MSSM by an additional Higgs singlet field. New parameters in the neutralino sector are the vacuum expectation value\nx of the singlet field and the trilinear couplings \u03bb and \u03ba in the superpotential, where\nthe product \u03bbx = \u03bceff replaces the \u03bc-parameter of the MSSM [8, 9]. The additional fifth\nneutralino may significantly change the phenomenology of the neutralino sector. In\nscenarios where the lightest supersymmetric particle is a nearly pure singlino, the existence of displaced vertices leads to a particularly interesting experimental signature\n[10, 11]. If the complete neutralino sector is accessible, the sum rules for the production cross sections show a different energy dependence in MSSM and NMSSM [6]. The\nNMSSM Higgs sector also depends on the soft scalar mass parameters A\u03bb and A\u03ba . It\ncontains five physical neutral Higgs bosons, three scalars Si and two pseudoscalars\nPi . In the following we will assume that only the light neutralinos, charginos and the\nlightest Higgs boson S1 are accessible at the first stage of the linear collider.\nIt has already been worked out that there exist MSSM and NMSSM scenarios with\nthe same mass spectra of the light neutralinos but different neutralino mixing. In this\ncase beam polarization is crucial for distinguishing the two models [12]. We present\na scenario where all kinematically accessible neutralinos and charginos have similar masses and almost identical cross sections, within experimental errors, in MSSM\nand NMSSM. Although the second lightest neutralino in the NMSSM has a significant\nsinglino component, the models cannot be distinguished by\u221aprecision measurements\nof masses and cross sections at the LHC or at the ILC with s = 500 GeV. While the\nbranching ratios for the neutralino decays into Higgs bosons may give first evidence,\nfinal identification of the underlying model requires precision measurements of the\nmasses and mixing characters of the heavier neutralinos by combined analyses of LHC\n\u221a\nL=1/3\nand ILC500 results and by exploiting the ILC650 option with s = 650 GeV at the cost\n2\n\n\fof reduced luminosity. The ILC650 option reflects the high flexibility of the ILC and\ndoes not require any specific setups in the experiment. Of course, the second energy\nstage of the ILC with energies up to 1 TeV also allows a discrimination. Here, however,\nwe focus on the potential of the ILC500/650 .\nThis paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe in detail our strategy for\nthe discrimination between NMSSM and MSSM. Our analysis is based on the scenario\npresented in Section 3. The following sections 4, 5 and 6 contain the numerical results\nfor the parameter determination at ILC500 , LHC and ILC650 . We estimate errors in the\nmass measurements and include statistical errors for the cross sections. Fit programs,\nwhich exist so far only for the MSSM [13], are not used. Special attention is given to\nthe interplay in combined analyses of the experimental results at ILC and LHC.\n\n2\n\nStrategy\n\nWe consider an NMSSM scenario where in the gaugino/higgsino sector only the\n0\n0\nmasses of the light chargino \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 and the light neutralinos \u03c7\u03031 and \u03c7\u03032 are accessible at\nthe ILC500 . We calculate the masses of the charginos and neutralinos and the cross\n\u2212\nsections for the pair production of the light chargino e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u03c7\u03031 and for the associated production of the light neutralinos e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 with polarized and unpolarized\nbeams.\nThe masses and cross sections provide the experimental input for deriving the supersymmetric parameters within the MSSM using standard methods [5, 6]:\n\u2022 We assume an uncertainty of 1\u20132% for the masses m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 , m\u03c7\u030301 , m\u03c7\u030302 , m\u03bd\u0303e , m\u1ebdL and\n\u2212\n+ \u2212\nm\u1ebdR . In the cross sections for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303+\n\u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 we include a\n1 \u03c7\u03031 and e e\nstatistical error of one standard deviation and take into account the error due to\nthe polarization uncertainty of \u2206Pe\u00b1 /Pe\u00b1 = 0.5%.\n\u2212\n\u2022 From the chargino mass m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 and the cross section e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u03c7\u03031 measured at two\n\u221a\nenergies, s = 400 GeV and 500 GeV, we determine bounds for the elements U11\nand V11 of the chargino mixing matrices. Polarized beams allow the resolution of\nambiguities and the improvement of the accuracy.\n\n\u2022 Using the mixing matrix elements U11 and V11 , the masses m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 , m\u03c7\u030301 and m\u03c7\u030302 , and\nthe cross sections for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 , we derive constraints for the parameters M1 ,\nM2 , \u03bc and tan \u03b2.\n\u2022 After the determination of the fundamental MSSM parameters we calculate the\nheavy chargino and neutralino masses and compare them with LHC analyses\n[14].\n\u221a\nThe experimental results from the ILC with s = 400 GeV and 500 GeV lead to consistent MSSM parameters despite the fact that we start with an NMSSM scenario where\nthe light neutralino \u03c7\u030302 has a significant singlino component. In the considered scenario\nthe ILC500 does not allow a discrimination between MSSM and NMSSM by mass and\ncross section measurements. Then the identification of the underlying supersymmetric\n3\n\n\fL=1/3\n\nmodel is performed in combined analyses at the LHC or the ILC650\nment of the masses of the heavy neutralinos and charginos.\n\n3\n\nby the measure-\n\nScenario\n\nWe discuss an NMSSM scenario where the lightest visible neutralino \u03c7\u030302 is accessible\nat the ILC500 and has a significant singlino component. The supersymmetric parameters and the resulting masses and neutralino mixing states are given in Table 1. For\nthe basis in the neutralino system we use the conventions of [15, 16]. The hierarchy\nM1 > M2 of the U(1) and SU(2) mass parameters causes an approximate mass degeneration of the lightest neutralino \u03c7\u030301 , which is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP), and the light chargino \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 that is typical for a minimal anomaly mediated SUSY-breaking mechanism (mAMSB) [17]. Even small mass differences may be\nresolved experimentally with good accuracy at the LHC [18] and by applying the ISR\nmethod [19] at the linear collider [20]. One should note, however, that we do not use\nany assumptions on possible SUSY-breaking mechanisms for the following parameter determination. For comparison Table 1 also contains the parameters of the MSSM\nscenario derived in Section 4, which leads to indistinguishable mass spectra and cross\nsections within the experimental errors at the ILC500 . All parameters are in agreement\nwith bounds from dark matter constraints [21].\nTable 2 shows the masses and mixings of the NMSSM Higgs bosons for parameters\nA\u03bb and A\u03ba within the theoretical and experimental constraints in the NMSSM scenario\n2740 GeV < A\u03bb < 5465 GeV,\n\u2212553 GeV < A\u03ba < 0 GeV.\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nHere the light scalar S1 has MSSM-like character while the second lightest scalar S2 and\nthe light pseudoscalar P1 are almost pure singlets with masses larger than 200 GeV for\n\u2212443 GeV < A\u03ba < \u221291 GeV. Within this A\u03ba region direct Higgs production does not\nallow the identification of the NMSSM [22] since scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons\nwith dominant singlet character escape detection. Detailed studies on the detection of\nlight singlet dominated Higgs bosons at the LHC and ILC can be found in [23], and of\nlight pseudoscalars in scenarios with dominant decay S1 \u2192 P1 P1 at LHC, ILC and the\nphoton collider in [24].\nDue to the mass difference between the light neutralinos in our scenario the decays\nof \u03c7\u030302 and \u03c7\u030303 into S2 and P1 are kinematically forbidden. The branching ratio for the\ndecay of \u03c7\u030302 into the lightest Higgs boson S1 is enhanced by a factor two to about 20% in\nthe NMSSM scenario compared to the MSSM. Therefore precise measurements of the\nneutralino decays into Higgs bosons could provide first evidence for the underlying\nmodel that has to be confirmed by the combined LHC and ILC analyses described in\nthe next sections.\n\n4\n\n\fNMSSM\n\nMSSM\n\nM1\n\n360 GeV\n\n375 GeV\n\nM2\n\n147 GeV\n\n152 GeV\n\ntan \u03b2\n\n10\n\n8\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2013\n\n360 GeV\n\n\u03bb\n\n0.5\n\n\u2013\n\nx\n\n915 GeV\n\n\u2013\n\n\u03ba\n\n0.2\n\n\u2013\n\nm\u03c7\u030301\n\n138 GeV\n\n138 GeV\n\nm\u03c7\u030302\n\n337 GeV\n\n344 GeV\n\nm\u03c7\u030303\n\n367 GeV\n\n366 GeV\n\nm\u03c7\u030304\n\n468 GeV\n\n410 GeV\n\nm\u03c7\u030305\n\n499 GeV\n\n\u2013\n\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b11\n\n139 GeV\n\n139 GeV\n\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b12\n\n474 GeV\n\n383 GeV\n\nm\u1ebdL\n\n240 GeV\n\n240 GeV\n\nm\u1ebdR\n\n220 GeV\n\n220 GeV\n\nm\u03bd\u0303e\n\n226 GeV\n\n226 GeV\n\n(\u22120.02, 0.97, \u22120.20, 0.09, \u22120.07)\n\n(0.03, \u22120.96, 0.26, \u22120.13)\n\n(\u22120.75, 0.04, 0.006, \u22120.12, 0.65)\n\n(\u22120.04, 0.10, \u22120.70, \u22120.71)\n\n(0.21, \u22120.16, \u22120.64, 0.62, 0.37)\n\n\u2013\n\n\u03c7\u030301 mixing state\n\u03c7\u030302 mixing state\n\u03c7\u030303 mixing state\n\u03c7\u030304\n\u03c7\u030305\n\nmixing state\nmixing state\n\n(0.62, 0.14, 0.25, \u22120.31, 0.65)\n\n(\u22120.03, 0.08, 0.70, 0.70, 0.08)\n\n(0.72, 0.22, 0.48, \u22120.46)\n\n(\u22120.70, 0.18, 0.47, \u22120.52)\n\nTable 1: Parameters, mass eigenvalues and neutralino mixing states in the basis\n(B\u0303 0 , W\u0303 0 , H\u030310, H\u030320 , S\u0303) in the NMSSM scenario.

Now the well-known strategies for determining the\nfundamental MSSM parameters in the gaugino/higgsino sector [6] are applied, taking into account experimental errors of 1.5% (2%) in the mass measurements of \u03c7\u030302,3 ,\n\u1ebdL,R , \u03bd\u0303 (\u03c7\u030301 , \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 ) and one standard deviation statistical errors for the cross sections [14]\nas given in TableR 3. The statistical errors are based on a total luminosity of 500 fb\u22121 ,\nwhich results in L = 100 fb\u22121 for each of the possible five polarization configurations\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (0, 0), (\u221290%, +60%), (\u221290%, \u221260%), (+90%, +60%) and (+90%, \u221260%).\nWe determine the components of the chargino eigenstates U11 and V11 [26] from\n2\nthe measured polarized cross sections, which are bilinear quadratic functions of U11\nand V112 and depend also on m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 and m\u03bd\u0303e . The expressions for the chargino cross sections are analytically inverted [14]. In order to resolve ambiguities\nwe assume that\n\u221a\nthe process has been measured at two different energies, s = 400 and 500 GeV, and\ndetermine the components of the chargino eigenstates, which are consistent with the\nmeasured cross sections within the estimated error bounds of Table 3\n2\nU11\n= [0.84, 1.0],\n\nV112 = [0.83, 1.0].\n6\n\n(3)\n\n\fm\u03c7\u030301 /GeV\nm\u03c7\u030302 /GeV\n\n138 \u00b1 2.8\n337 \u00b1 5.1\n\nm\u1ebdL /GeV\nm\u1ebdR /GeV\n\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 /GeV 139 \u00b1 2.8\n\n240 \u00b1 3.6\n220 \u00b1 3.3\n\nm\u03bd\u0303e /GeV\n226 \u00b1 3.4\n\u221a\n\u2213\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\ns = 400 GeV\n1 \u03c7\u03031 )/fb at\n\n323.9 \u00b1 33.5\n\nUnpolarized beams\n\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (\u221290%, +60%)\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (+90%, \u221260%)\n\n\u2213\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 \u03c7\u03031 )/fb at\n\n984.0 \u00b1 101.6\n\u221a\n\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (\u221290%, +60%)\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 )/fb at\n\nUnpolarized beams\n\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (\u221290%, +60%)\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (+90%, \u221260%)\n\ns = 500 GeV\n287.5 \u00b1 16.5\n\nUnpolarized beams\n\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (+90%, \u221260%)\n\n13.6 \u00b1 1.6\n\n873.9 \u00b1 50.1\n\u221a\n\n11.7 \u00b1 1.2\n\ns = 500 GeV\n4.0 \u00b1 1.2\n\n12.1 \u00b1 3.8\n0.2 \u00b1 0.1\n\nTable 3: Masses with 1.5% (\u03c7\u030302,3 , \u1ebdL,R , \u03bd\u0303) and 2% (\u03c7\u030301 , \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 ) uncertainty and cross sections\nwith an error composed of the error due to the mass\nR and polarization uncertainties and\none standard deviation statistical error based on L = 100 fb\u22121 , for both unpolarized\nbeams and polarized beams with (Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (\u221390%, \u00b160%) and \u2206Pe\u00b1 /Pe\u00b1 = 0.5%,\nin analogy to the study in [14].\nWe then exploit additionally the polarized neutralino cross sections \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 ) at\n\u221a\ns = 500 GeV and the measured masses m\u03c7\u030301 , m\u03c7\u030302 , m\u1ebdL and m\u1ebdR in order to determine\nthe parameters M1 , M2 , \u03bc and tan \u03b2:\nM1\nM2\n\u03bc\ntan \u03b2\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n377 \u00b1 42 GeV,\n150 \u00b1 20 GeV,\n450 \u00b1 100 GeV,\n[1, 30].\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nNote that, in our mAMSB-inspired scenario with M1 > M2 , the crucial observable to\ndetermine the parameter M1 is m\u03c7\u030302 , which can be clearly seen in Fig. 1 [27]. Since the\nheavier neutralino and chargino states are not produced, the parameters \u03bc and tan \u03b2\nare determined with a considerable uncertainty.\nIn conclusion the measured masses and cross sections as experimental input from\nthe ILC500 are compatible with the MSSM. For the allowed ranges (4)\u2013(7) of the MSSM\nparameters we now predict the heavier neutralino and chargino masses within the\nMSSM:\nm\u03c7\u030303 = 443 \u00b1 107 GeV,\n\n(8)\n7\n\n\fm\u03c7\u03030i /GeV\n\nm\u03c7\u030305\n500\nm\u03c7\u030304\nm\u03c7\u030303\n\n400\n\nm\u03c7\u030302\n\n300\n200\n\nm\u03c7\u030301\n\n100\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\nM1 /GeV\n\nFigure 1: The neutralino masses m\u03c7\u03030i , i = 1, . . . , 5 as a function of M1 in the NMSSM for\nthe scenario of Table 1.\nm\u03c7\u030304 = 490 \u00b1 110 GeV,\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b12 = 475 \u00b1 125 GeV.\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nWe emphasize that although we started with an NMSSM scenario where \u03c7\u030302 and \u03c7\u030303\nhave large singlino admixtures (see Table 1), the strategy [5, 6] to determine the MSSM\nparameters is successful. All predictions for the heavier gaugino/higgsino masses are\nconsistent in both models. In order to distinguish between the models, the measurement of the heavier neutralino and chargino masses at the LHC or with the ILC650\noption is necessary. In our NMSSM scenario the gaugino admixture of \u03c7\u030303 probably allows its mass measurement at the LHC, whereas in the MSSM the neutralino \u03c7\u030303 always\nhas a strong higgsino character within the predicted parameter ranges, eqs. (4)\u2013(7), and\nwould hardly be visible at the LHC.\n\n5\n\nSUSY searches at the LHC\n\nThe LHC has an excellent potential to discover supersymmetric particles. The expected\nlarge cross sections for squark and gluino production at the LHC give access to a large\nspectrum of coloured as well as non-coloured supersymmetric particles via the cascade\ndecays. Simulations [28] exist e.g. for the mSUGRA point SPS1a [29]. It has also been\nworked out how to measure the masses of the heavier gauginos in cascade decays at\nthe LHC [30]. Mass predictions from the ILC analysis lead to an increase of statistical\nsensitivity for the LHC analysis and open the possibility of identifying heavier gauginos even in marginal signals in the squark cascades [14]. However, since higgsino-like\ncharginos and neutralinos do not couple to squarks, their detection via cascade decays\nis not possible. Direct pair production of charginos and neutralinos that occurs via\nDrell\u2013Yan production is strongly suppressed for masses larger than about 300 GeV as\nwell as single neutralino production [31].\nThe mAMSB-inspired scenario of Table 1 contains nearly mass degenerate \u03c7\u030301 and\n\u00b1\n\u03c7\u03031 with an LSP\u2013NLSP mass difference in the difficult region for hadron colliders of\n8\n\n\f200 MeV < m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 \u2212 m\u03c7\u030301 < 2 GeV because the short-lived \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 is not directly observable\nand its SM decay particles are softly emitted and suffer from a large background [18].\nApplying specific cuts and using suitable kinematical variables, however, leads to a\nrather accurate measurement of the mass difference. A gain in accuracy can be obtained using the LSP and NLSP mass from ILC measurements. Since there exists no\nsimulation for our chosen parameter point, we assume a precision for the heavier neutralino masses as in [30], motivated by supersymmetric searches in AMSB scenarios at\nthe LHC [18]. A more detailed analysis will be performed in a forthcoming work [32].\nThe neutralinos \u03c7\u030302 and \u03c7\u030303 have a large bino-admixture and therefore appear in\nthe squark decay cascades. The dominant decay mode of \u03c7\u030302 has a branching ratio\n\u00b1\n\u2213\n0\n0\n\u2213\nBR(\u03c7\u030302 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 W ) \u223c 50%, while for the \u03c7\u03033 decays BR(\u03c7\u03033 \u2192 l\u0303L,R l ) \u223c 45% is largest.\n0\n0\nSince the heavier neutralinos, \u03c7\u03034 , \u03c7\u03035 , are mainly higgsino-like, no visible edges from\n\u2213\nthese particles occur in the cascades. It is expected to see the edges for \u03c7\u030302 \u2192 l\u0303\u00b1\nRl ,\n\u00b1 \u2213\n\u00b1 \u2213\n\u2213\n0\n0\n\u03c7\u030302 \u2192 l\u0303\u00b1\nL l , \u03c7\u03033 \u2192 l\u0303R l and for \u03c7\u03033 \u2192 l\u0303L l [32, 33].\nWith a precise mass measurement of \u03c7\u030301 ,\u03c7\u030302 , l\u0303L,R and \u03bd\u0303 from the ILC500 analysis, a\nclear identification and separation of the edges of the two gauginos at the LHC is possible without imposing specific model assumptions. We therefore assume a precision\nof about 2% for the measurement of m\u03c7\u030303 , in analogy to [30]:\nm\u03c7\u030303 = 367 \u00b1 7 GeV.\n\n(11)\n\nHere the error assumption is rather conservative since contrary to the scenarios in [30]\n\u2213\nthe branching ratio BR(q\u0303R \u2192 \u03c7\u030303 q) \u00d7 BR(\u03c7\u030303 \u2192 l\u0303\u00b1\nL,R l ) is very large [33].\n0\nThe precise mass measurement of \u03c7\u03033 is compatible with the mass predictions of the\nILC500 . However, it is still to confirm that the measured particle is indeed the \u03c7\u030303 and\nnot the \u03c7\u030304 . The predicted \u03c7\u030303 in the MSSM is nearly a pure higgsino, which is typical for\nthe constrained MSSM, and does not couple in the cascade decays, while the \u03c7\u030304 with\na sufficiently large gaugino component could be measured in the cascades [14, 30]. In\norder to identify the particle and finally determine the masses and mixing characters\nof the heavy neutralinos one has to discuss the following cases:\n\u2022 Assuming the measured particle to be \u03c7\u030303 and feeding it back in the ILC analysis\nlead to improved parameter determination and mass predictions for m\u03c7\u030304 and\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b12 . Using eq. (11) for the ILC500 analysis leads in our case, after rechecking\n\u2212\nwith the allowed cross sections of \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 and \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u03c7\u03031 production, to the precise mass\npredictions:\nm\u03c7\u030304 = [384, 393] GeV and m\u03c7\u0303\u00b12 = [360, 380] GeV.\n\n(12)\n\n\u2022 Assuming the measured particle to be \u03c7\u030304 and feeding it back in the parameter\ndetermination of the ILC analysis lead to inconsistency with the measured cross\n\u2212\nsections of \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 and \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u03c7\u03031 production.\nThe combined LHC/ILC500 analysis therefore leads to a consistent interpretation\nof the measured particles in the cascades. However, a neutralino \u03c7\u030303 with sufficiently\n9\n\n\flarge gaugino admixture to couple to squarks is incompatible with the allowed parameter ranges of eqs. (4)\u2013(7) in the MSSM. One should note that this result has been\nderived within the chargino/neutralino sector of the CP-conserving unconstrained\nMSSM, without any assumption concerning the SUSY-breaking mechanism.\nWe point out that a measurement of the neutralino masses m\u03c7\u030301 , m\u03c7\u030302 , m\u03c7\u030303 which\ncan take place at the LHC alone is not sufficient to distinguish the SUSY models since\nrather similar mass spectra may exist. Both a model-independent analysis using cross\nsection and masses at the ILC and the precisely measured masses from the cascade\nanalysis at the LHC are needed for the identification of the particles. Furthermore,\nthe results from the LHC and the ILC500 analyses and the precise predictions for the\nmissing chargino/neutralino masses, eq. (12), motivates to apply immediately the lowL=1/3\nluminosity but higher-energy option ILC650 , which finally could lead to the correct\nidentification of the underlying model.\n\n6\n\nL=1/3\n\nThe ILC650\n\noption\n\nThe ILC design provides the option to enhance instantaneously\nthe energy at the cost\n\u221a\nof reduced luminosity.\nA centre-of-mass energy of s = 650 GeV at a third of the\nR\nluminosity, i.e. L = 33 fb\u22121 per polarization configuration, does not require hardware\nchanges in the experimental set-up but only running time.\nThe inconsistency of the MSSM analyses, the predicted higgsino-like \u03c7\u030303 and the\nmeasurement of this neutralino at the LHC, described in the previous sections may\nmotivate this higher-energy option. The expected polarized and unpolarized cross\nsections, including the statistical error on the basis of one third of the luminosity of\nthe ILC500 , are given in Table 4. The neutralino \u03c7\u030303 as well as the higgsino-like heavy\nL=1/3\nneutralino \u03c7\u030304 and the chargino \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n. The production\n2 are now accessible at the ILC650\n0 0\n0 0\nof \u03c7\u03031 \u03c7\u03033 and \u03c7\u03031 \u03c7\u03034 leads to promising rates at the 650 GeV option while the heaviest\nneutralino \u03c7\u030305 is still too close to the threshold and the production cross sections are\nprobably too small to be observed. The precise mass measurements of \u03c7\u030304 and \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n2 lead\nto a clear identification of the supersymmetric model by comparing them with the\npredictions of eq. (12). The accuracy of \u03bceff = \u03bbx is improved by the measurements of\n\u2213\nthe cross sections for the associated \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 \u03c7\u03032 production shown in Table 5.\nFinally the masses m\u03c7\u030301 , m\u03c7\u030302 , m\u03c7\u030303 , m\u03c7\u030304 and m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 , m\u03c7\u0303\u00b12 , as well as the cross sections,\nconstitute the observables for a fit of the parameters M1 , M2 , tan \u03b2, \u03bb and \u03bceff = \u03bbx, \u03bax\nof the gaugino/higgsino sector, which is, however, beyond the scope of this paper. Our\nanalysis shows that the interplay between the two experiments is crucial for the determination\nof the supersymmetric model. It motivates the use of the low-luminosity,\n\u221a\ns = 650 GeV, option of the ILC in order to resolve model ambiguities even at an early\nstage of the experiment and outlines future search strategies at an upgraded LHC as\nwell as at the ILC at 1 TeV.\n\n10\n\n\f\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u03030j )/fb at\nj=3\nj=4\nUnpolarized beams\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (\u221290%, +60%)\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (+90%, \u221260%)\n\n12.2 \u00b1 0.6\n36.9 \u00b1 1.1\n0.6 \u00b1 0.1\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 650 GeV\nj=5\n\n5.5 \u00b1 0.4\n14.8 \u00b1 0.7\n2.2 \u00b1 0.3\n\n\u2264 0.02\n\u2264 0.07\n\u2264 0.01\n\nTable 4: Expected cross sections for the associated production of the heavier neutraliL=1/3\nnos in the NMSSM scenario of Table 1 for the ILC650 option with one sigma statistical\nerror based on L = 33 fb\u22121 for both unpolarized and polarized beams.\nUnpolarized beams\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (\u221290%, +60%)\n(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (+90%, \u221260%)\n\n\u2213\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 \u03c7\u03032 )/fb at\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 650 GeV\n\n2.4 \u00b1 0.3\n5.8 \u00b1 0.4\n1.6 \u00b1 0.2\n\nTable 5: Expected cross sections for the associated production of the charginos in the\nL=1/3\nNMSSM scenario of Table 1 for the ILC650 option with one sigma statistical error\nbased on L = 33 fb\u22121 for both unpolarized and polarized beams.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have presented a scenario in the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model\n(NMSSM) that cannot be distinguished\nfrom the MSSM at the first stage of the Inter\u221a\nnational Linear Collider with s = 500 GeV by cross section and mass measurements.\nAlthough a light neutralino has a significant singlino component in the NMSSM, the\nmasses of the accessible light neutralinos and charginos, as well as the production cross\nsections, are identical in the two models within experimental errors. The measurement of the masses of the heavier neutralinos and charginos in combined analyses of\nL=1/3\nthe\n\u221a experimental results at the LHC and at the higher-energy option ILC650 with\ns = 650 GeV leads to a clear identification of the supersymmetric model.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are very grateful to G.
