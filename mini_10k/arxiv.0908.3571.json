The wave propagates globally\nover the whole solar hemisphere visible to STEREO-B with a constant velocity\nof \u223c 263 \u00b1 16 km s\u22121 . From the two STEREO observations we derive a height of\nthe wave in the range of \u223c80\u2013100 Mm. Comparison of the wave kinematics with\nthe early phase of the erupting CME structure indicates that the wave is initiated\nby the CME lateral expansion, and then propagates freely with a velocity close\nto the fast magnetosonic speed in the quiet solar corona.\nSubject headings: Sun: corona - Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - Sun:\nflares\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLarge-scale coronal disturbances propagating over significant fractions of the solar disk\nwere for the first time imaged by the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Moses et al. 1997; Thompson et al.\n1998). After their discovery, these so-called \"EIT waves\" were frequently observed at\nextreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths in association with flares and coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs; e.g. Wills-Davey & Thompson 1999; Klassen et al. 2000; Biesecker et al. 2002). EIT\nwaves were originally assumed to be the coronal counterparts of the chromospheric Moreton waves (Moreton & Ramsey 1960), predicted in Uchida's \"sweeping-skirt-hypothesis\"\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n(Thompson et al. 1999). Moreton waves appear as arc-like disturbances in H\u03b1 filtergrams\npropagating away from the flare site with velocities of 500 to 1000 km s\u22121 (e.g. Warmuth et al.\n2004). They were interpreted as the ground-track signature of a coronal fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shock wave, which compresses and pushes the chromospheric plasma\ndownward when sweeping over it (Uchida 1968).\nHowever, soon after the discovery of EIT waves, their interpretation as coronal Moreton waves was questioned, mainly based on statistical studies reporting significant differences between both phenomena: in particular EIT waves occur much more frequently and\nare on average considerably slower than Moreton waves with velocities in the range \u223c170\u2013\n350 km s\u22121 (Klassen et al. 2000; Biesecker et al. 2002). On the other hand, in case studies\nof strong flare/CME events, where both phenomena could be observed simultaneously, the\n(single) EIT wave fronts were found to be roughly co-spatial with the Moreton wave fronts\n(e.g. Thompson et al. 2000; Warmuth et al. 2001). Twelve years after their discovery, EIT\nwaves (or more generally, global EUV waves) are still a very controversial subject in solar\nphysics. Are they really the coronal counterparts of Moreton waves (e.g. Thompson et al.\n2000; Warmuth et al. 2001; Vr\u0161nak et al. 2006; Veronig et al. 2006). Are they really (MHD\nshock) waves (e.g. Wang 2000; Wu et al. 2001; Warmuth et al. 2001; Vr\u0161nak et al. 2006;\nWills-Davey et al. 2007), or rather propagating disturbances (\"pseudo-waves\") related to\nthe successive opening of magnetic field lines during the CME lift-off or forced magnetic reconnection ahead of the CME (e.g. Delann\u00e9e & Aulanier 1999; Chen et al. 2002; Attrill et al.\n2007)? Are they initiated by the erupting CME, or by the explosive flare energy release?\nFor a recent review the reader is referred to Vr\u0161nak & Cliver (2008).\nA significant drawback in understanding global coronal waves are the limitations of the\nEIT observations. Due to the EIT cadence which is at best 12 min, these events are drastically undersampled. The Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI; Howard et al. 2008) instruments onboard the twin spacecraft of the Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO;\nKaiser et al. 2008), provide fundamentally new potential in studying large-scale disturbances\nin the solar corona, due to their high observing cadence in different EUV passbands, the large\nfield-of-view (up to 1.7 R\u2299 ) and the two separated vantage points. With such observing capabilities it is for the first time possible to study in detail the structure and kinematics of global\nEUV waves together with the evolution of the associated CME and flare. So far, a few case\nstudies have been carried out with STEREO/EUVI data. The wave of 19 May 2007 observed\nat low spacecraft separation was studied in quite some detail by several groups: Long et al.\n(2008) found that the disturbance was observed in all four EUVI passbands hinting at the\nmultithermal coronal nature of the wave. The wave signature in the 304 \u00c5 passband was\nproposed to be due to a strong contribution from a Si xi line formed at coronal temperatures.\nVeronig et al. (2008) derived a significant deceleration in the wave kinematics, from about\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n450 to 200 km s\u22121 , consistent with the decay of a freely propagating large-amplitude MHD\nfast-mode wave (see also Long et al. 2008). Further evidence for the fast-mode nature of\nthe observed disturbance was provided by Gopalswamy et al. (2009) who studied the wave\nreflection at the borders of a coronal hole. Refractions and reflections of fast-mode coronal\nMHD waves at regions of high Alfv\u00e9n velocity were previously studied in simulations (e.g.\nWang 2000; Wu et al. 2001; Ofman & Thompson 2002), and provide strong evidence for the\nwave nature of the phenomenon. Patsourakos et al. (2009) presented the first study of an\nEUV wave observed at large separation of the two STEREO spacecraft (\u223c45\u25e6 ). These authors studied the 3D evolution of the associated CME, finding a close association between\nthe expanding CME loops and the wave onset. Combining the observations with simulations,\nthese authors provide strong evidence for the fast-mode MHD wave nature of the observed\ndisturbance.\nIn this Letter, we present the first observations of a global EUV wave observed with\nthe two STEREO spacecraft in quadrature. The wave of 13 February 2009 was observed\nsimultaneously at disk center by STEREO-B and on the solar limb by STEREO-A. These\nunprecedented STEREO quadrature observations allow us to study in detail the 3D kinematics and 3D structure of the wave together with the onset and early evolution of the\nassociated CME, and how both phenomena are related.\n\n2.\n\nData\n\nThe STEREO mission consists of two spacecraft with identical instrument suites orbiting\nthe Sun near the ecliptic plane. STEREO-A(head) moves on a slightly smaller orbit than the\nEarth, while the orbit of STEREO-B(ehind) is slightly larger, resulting in an increase of their\nangular separation by 45\u25e6 per year. On February 13, 2009 the two STEREO satellites were\n91\u25e6 apart, observing in perfect quadrature a global EUV wave associated with a GOES B2.4\nflare/CME event. The evolution of the coronal wave and the onset of the associated CME is\nstudied in high-cadence STEREO EUVI imagery. In the 195 \u00c5 filter, the observing cadence\nwas 10 min for both STEREO satellites, in the 171 \u00c5 filter it was 2.5 min for STEREO-A and\n5 min for STEREO-B [henceforth ST-A and ST-B]. To compare the observations from ST-A\n(on 13 February 2009, at a distance of 0.964 AU from Sun) and ST-B (1.003 AU), all images\nwere re-scaled to Earth distance (0.987 AU). The EUVI data were fully reduced using the\nSECCHI PREP routines available within Solarsoft, and differentially rotated to 05:30 UT.\nTo enhance the contrast of the transient wave signatures, we constructed from the EUVI\n171 and 195 \u00c5 frames running difference and running ratio images, where we subtracted\n(divided) from each image a frame that was taken 10 min before.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nWave kinematics\n\nST-B observed the coronal wave on the solar disk, with the wave center and the associated weak B2.4 flare being located precisely at Sun center. Due to the satellite's quadrature\nconfiguration, this results in a perfect limb event for ST-A. Figure 1 shows the wave evolution in simultaneous EUVI 195 \u00c5 running difference images from ST-A and ST-B (see also\nthe accompanying movie). Figure 2 shows one snapshot of the wave observed in the EUVI\n171 \u00c5 filter. A movie of 171 \u00c5 running ratio images (with 5 min cadence) is available in the\nonline material. The coronal wave was first observed at 05:35 UT, and could be followed up\nto at least 06:20 UT. ST-B observations reveal that the coronal wave is globally propagating\ninto all directions, but with much larger brightness toward the western hemisphere. ST-A\nshows the wave propagation at the solar limb as well as the erupting CME structure. In the\nlast two panels in Fig. 1, ST-A observes the coronal wave simultaneously above the limb as\nwell as on the disk.\nIn Fig. 3, we plot a ST-B 195 \u00c5 direct image together with all wavefronts determined\nfrom ST-B 195 \u00c5 running difference images. The source center required to derive the kinematics of the wave was obtained from circular fits to the earliest wavefronts in the 3D\nspherical plane (for details we refer to Veronig et al. 2006). The resulting fits and derived\nwave centers are also plotted in Fig. 3, showing the wave initiation center slightly north of\nthe flaring active region. For each wavefront identified in the ST-B 195 \u00c5 and 171 \u00c5 running difference images, we determined the mean distance from the derived center along the\nspherical solar surface.\nThe bottom panel in Fig. 4 shows the resulting wave kinematics together with the GOES\nsoft X-ray flux of the associated B2.4 flare. Green triangles and blue diamonds mark the mean\ndistances of the wavefronts observed on-disk in EUVI-B 195 \u00c5 and in 171 \u00c5, respectively. The\nvelocity of the wave, v \u223c 243 \u00b1 14 km s\u22121 , is constant over the full propagation range from\n200 to 750 Mm. We also studied the wave kinematics separately for different propagation\nsectors (not shown in Fig. 4). The velocity derived for different directions is the same within\nthe error bars but the brightness is quite different for the propagation into the western\nand eastern direction (see Figs. 1 and the online movies). These findings imply that the\npropagation speed does not vary with the amplitude of the perturbation.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.2.\n\n3D structure of the wave\n\nThe lateral observations of the wave from ST-A clearly reveal its 3D nature, with the\nwave front visible to a considerable height above the solar surface (last panel in Fig. 5). In\nthe following, we compare the wave kinematics as observed on-disk from ST-B with those\nderived from the limb-observations in ST-A. Since ST-A has an edge-on view of the wave,\nthe distance measurements are basically free from projection effects. We also show how the\ndata from two observing platforms separated by \u223c90\u25e6 can be used to estimate the typical\nheights of the wave observations in on-disk measurements.\nThe red asterisks in the bottom panel in Fig. 4 show the wave kinematics as obtained\nfrom ST-A by measuring the wave evolution along the solar limb, i.e. at a height of 0\u2032\u2032 . The\nresulting data points lie 50\u2013100 Mm behind the kinematical curve derived from the on-disk\nST-B observations, indicating that the wave propagates significantly above the solar surface.\nHowever, if we just increase the spherical surface on which the wavefront observed by ST-A\nis measured, we are not able to obtain a reasonable agreement with the wave kinematics\nderived from ST-B on-disk observations. This is demonstrated by the red x symbols in\nFig. 4, showing the wave kinematics derived along a spherical surface at a height of 130\u2032\u2032\nabove the solar limb. Considering the 3D nature of the wave, projection effects have to be\ntaken into account in the ST-B on-disk observations. The ST-B on-disk observations are\nthen a result of integrating the emission from the wave front high above the solar surface\nalong the line-of-sight (illustrated by the long arrow in Fig. 5). Assuming a height of 130\u2032\u2032\n(\u223c90 Mm) for the wave observations projected onto the solar surface, the wavefront distances\nand velocities derived from ST-A and ST-B are in agreement (see Fig. 4).\nWhat do we learn from this? First, the emission of EUV waves observed on-disk originates from high above the solar surface (\u223c80\u2013100 Mm). This is similar to the height\nof \u223c90 \u00b1 7 Mm derived for a global EUV wave observed with STEREO at a spacecraft\nseparation of 45\u25e6 using triangulation techniques (Patsourakos et al. 2009). Such heights are\ncomparable to the coronal scale-height of 50\u2013100 Mm for quiet Sun temperatures of 1\u20132 MK,\nand consistent with the propagation of a MHD fast-mode wave over quiet Sun regions, since\nthe wave perturbs and compresses the ambient coronal plasma with its bulk confined within\na coronal scale-height (Patsourakos et al. 2009). Second, the derived wave height of about\n80\u2013100 Mm is not the upper edge (see also the right panel in Fig. 5) but reflects the maximum\nof the line-of-sight integration of the increased intensity due to the plasma compression at the\nwave front. Third, there may be an underestimation of about 10% of the coronal wave speed\nderived from the disk-observations (243 \u00b1 14 km s\u22121 ) with regard to the \"real\" propagation\nvelocity at heights of 80\u2013100 Mm, where we find v \u223c 263 \u00b1 16 km s\u22121 .\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.3.\n\nAssociated coronal mass ejection\n\nThe early evolution of the erupting CME associated with the coronal wave is observed\nwith high-cadence by ST-A, basically free from projection effects. This enables us to study\nthe expansion of the erupting CME with relation to the wave propagation. In order to\nenhance the coronal structures above the limb, we removed the steep radial intensity gradient\nby a normalizing-radial-graded filter (NRGF; Morgan et al. 2006). A bulb-like pre-CME\nstructure is observed hours before the event, and starts to erupt around 05:30\u201305:35 UT\n(Fig. 5).\nIn order to follow in detail the CME take-off and lateral expansion in the low corona,\nwe selected various vertical slices in the plane of sky from the NRGF-filtered EUVI-A 171 \u00c5\nimages (available at a cadence of 2.5 min) at different coronal heights. In Fig. 4, we show\nthree stack plots extracted from 2\u2032\u2032 -slices centered at x = \u22121000\u2032\u2032 , \u22121100\u2032\u2032 , and \u22121200\u2032\u2032\n(indicated in the first panel in Fig. 5) covering the length y = [\u2212600\u2032\u2032 , +500\u2032\u2032 ]. These plots\nreveal the pre-existing CME structure as well as the expansion of the CME flanks. (Though\nwe note that the stack plots include also some contribution of the CME upward movement\nin addition to the expansion.) The bifurcation of the bright horizontal feature indicates the\nonset of the lateral expansion of the CME. In the x = \u22121100\u2032\u2032 (H \u223c 90 Mm) stack plot, the\nbifurcation starts at \u223c05:32 UT with the fastest growth around 05:35 UT. For x = \u22121200\u2032\u2032\n(H \u223c 160 Mm), the fast onset occurs later by about 2\u20133 min. The expansion stops at\n\u223c05:50 UT for x = \u22121100\u2032\u2032 and at \u223c06:00 UT for x = \u22121200\u2032\u2032 . In the x = \u22121000\u2032\u2032 slice,\nwhich is low in the corona (H \u223c 20 Mm), only a marginal CME expansion is observed,\nrevealing the anchored ends of the CME flanks.\nStudying stack plots at various heights (x-positions), we find that the coronal wave\nonset (\u223c05:35 UT) is consistent with the CME lateral expansion at coronal heights in the\nrange 70\u2013120 Mm. At the slice x = \u22121100\u2032\u2032 (H \u223c 90 Mm), shown in Fig. 4, the expansion\nstarts around 05:32 reaching the fastest growth at \u223c05:35 UT. This suggests that the wave is\ninitiated between \u223c05:32\u201305:35 UT by the CME expanding flanks, and thereafter propagates\nfreely. In the last panel in Fig. 5, we show a EUVI-A 195 \u00c5 high-contrast ratio image at\n06:05 UT, which clearly reveals the coronal wave (above the limb as well as on the disk) far\naway from the erupting structure.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nFrom the STEREO quadrature observations of a coronal wave observed simultaneously\nin frontal and lateral view, we find that the EUV emission of the coronal wave originates at a\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nheight of about 80\u2013100 Mm. The wave propagation speed (corrected for projection effects) is\n\u223c260 km s\u22121 . The wave speed is constant over the full range of quiet-Sun region it traversed\nand homogeneous in all directions though the perturbation amplitudes are quite different\nfor different propagation directions (in particular toward the western and eastern direction\nas observed from ST-B). This is a different behavior compared to the wave observed by\nSTEREO on 19 May 2009, which revealed a distinct deceleration from \u223c450 to 200 km s\u22121\n(Veronig et al. 2008). The associated flare X-ray flux is very weak (GOES B2.3), which\nsuggests that the flare pressure pulse is unlikely to be causing the wave.\nThe first observations of the wave coincides with the onset of fast expansion of the CME\nexpanding flanks at a height of \u223c70\u2013120 Mm (see Fig. 4) suggesting that this expansion\ninitiates the wave. Afterwards, the wave propagates freely and is far ahead of the observed\nCME flanks (see right panel of Fig. 5). Such a behavior was also observed in the EUVI\nevent studied in Patsourakos et al. (2009). This offset of the wave front with respect to\nthe projected CME flank is not in line with the behavior expected from the \"pseudo-wave\"\nmodels (e.g. Delann\u00e9e & Aulanier 1999; Chen et al. 2002; Attrill et al. 2007), where the wave\nfront should be basically co-spatial with the CME front. From the stack plots in Fig. 4 and\nfrom direct measurements of the CME expanding flanks, we find that the peak velocity of\nthe lateral CME expansion at a fixed height of \u223c90 Mm is \u223c150 km s\u22121 . This provides us\nwith an estimate of the driver speed.\nThese findings (driver speed smaller than wave speed; constant wave velocity over the\nfull observation range, i.e. not varying with amplitude) indicate that we are dealing with\na fast-mode MHD wave not too far from the linear regime. In this case, we would expect\nthe wave to propagate at the characteristic speed of the medium (i.e. the fast magnetosonic\nspeed), independent of the amplitude of the perturbation. A fast magnetosonic speed in\nthe range of 260 km s\u22121 is not unreasonable for quiet Sun coronal conditions in the deep\nsolar minimum. Recently, direct magnetic field measurements of the corona were deduced by\nLin et al. (2004) who obtained a field strength of 4 Gauss above an active region at a height\nof \u223c1.1 R\u2299 . Assuming for quiet Sun conditions a magnetic field strength in the range of 1 to\n3 Gauss and a coronal density of 5 * 108 cm\u22123 , the fast magnetosonic speed lies in the range\n210 to 350 km s\u22121 which is consistent with the observed wave velocity. Thus, we conclude\nthat the observed EUV transient is a real wave, and that its observational characteristics is\nconsistent with a low-amplitude MHD fast-mode wave (i.e. not a shock wave). Finally, we\nnote that there is a recent paper on the same event (Patsourakos & Vourlidas 2009). These\nauthors basically arrive at the same conclusions of a fast-mode MHD wave but use a different\napproach, modeling the CME and wave structures based on EUVI and COR observations.\nI.W.K. and A.M.V. acknowledge the Austrian Fonds zur F\u00f6rderung der wissenschaftlichen\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nForschung (FWF grant P20876-N16).
