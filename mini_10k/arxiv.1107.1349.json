Introduction\nThe Hall effect of light is a well known phenomenon demonstrating how the internal state of\nthe light beam (polarization or inhomogeneous energy distribution) affects its trajectory (see, e.g.,\nRefs. [1,2]). The most impressive and intensively studied manifestation is associated with lateral\n(out of the incidence plane) shifts of reflected and refracted beams occurring when a circularly\npolarized beam falls onto a plane boundary between two homogeneous media (Imbert \u2013 Fedorov\nshift) [3\u201310].\nIts usual explanation is based on the incident beam representation as a superposition of partial\nplane waves. Each of them generates its own refracted and reflected (secondary) counterparts in\naccordance to the known Snell and Fresnel laws [11], so that every secondary plane wave changes\nthe direction, amplitude and phase in respect to its prototype. Afterwards all the reflected (refracted)\nplane waves are put together to form the corresponding reflected (refracted) beam. Geometric\nphases, accepted by the circularly polarized secondary waves in compliance with their directions,\nlead to specific transformation of the output beam profile resulting in the Imbert\u2013Fedorov shift\n[4,7\u20139]. Simultaneously, this shift warrants conservation of the beam angular momentum in the\nreflection or refraction process [1,4].\nSuch way of reasoning seems to be the most natural and almost automatically leads to the\ncorrect results. However, it looks rather formal. Operating in the Fourier space provides limited\npossibilities of employing pictorial arguments, based on the incident beam spatial structure, and role\nof the beam spatial parameters in the emergence and strength of the discussed effect remains\nobscure.\nReally, consider a monochromatic paraxial beam with the wave number k propagating along\naxis z in a homogeneous medium with the refraction index n .

In actual fact, the paraxial field representation via Eqs.\ni\n\n=\u2212\n\n(1) and (2) goes back to the seminal work [14].

Of course, their meaning for\nthe energy/momentum distribution of the beam as a whole is negligible: corresponding contribution\n2\n2\nproportional to E z + H z ~ \u03b3 2 should be discarded in the first-order paraxial approximation\n\n[14,15]. But the very existence of the components (9), that explicitly change the forms with\nswitching the circular polarization sign, qualitatively affirms that polarization affects the beam\nspatial characteristics [17,18]. In fact, the \"vortex\" longitudinal component is the only polarizationdependent feature of the incident paraxial beam, and all the subsequent spin-sensitive effects, that\nmay happen to the beam in the course of its propagation or transformations, inevitably \"stem\" from\nthis longitudinal field. For example, relative magnitude of the z -components can be substantially\namplified and their vortex nature comes to light due to violation of the beam paraxiality (e.g., after\nthe beam is tightly focused [1,15,19\u201321]). Likewise, here we intend to show that it is the\nlongitudinal field (9) that underlies the polarization-dependent effects accompanying the beam\nrefraction and reflection.\n2. General calculations\nThe standard scheme of the beam transformation at a plane interface is illustrated by Fig. 1\nfollowing to Ref. [22]. Plane N separates two homogeneous half-spaces with refraction indices n I\n\nand nT . The incident (I), reflected (R) and refracted (T) beams propagate along axes z j\n( j = I , R, T ); with each interacting beam, its own coordinate frame is associated, all origins\ncoinciding, axes x j lie in the plane of incidence, axis y j \u2261 y is common and belongs to the\nboundary plane. In their own frames, the beams are described by Eqs. (1) and (2) with refraction\nindices n I , nR = nI , nT , wavenumbers k I , k R = k I , kT and complex amplitudes u XI ,Y ( x I , y , z I ) ,\nu XR ,Y ( xR , y , z R ) , u TX ,Y ( xT , y , zT ) respectively. The axes' directions are regulated by the refraction\n\nand reflection laws,\n\nnI sin \u03b8 I = nT sin \u03b8T , \u03b8 R = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8 I .\n\n(10)\n\nPT\n\n\u03b8T\nPI\nrI\n\nnT\n\nzT\nrT\n\nr\n\nnI\n\nPR\n\ny\n\n\u03b8R = \u03c0 \u2013 \u03b8I\n\nrR\n\nxR\nzI\n\n\u03b8I\n\nN\n\nxI\nxT\nzR\n\nFig. 1. Geometric conditions for the beam transformation at a plane boundary. Complex\namplitudes of the incident, reflected and refracted beams are defined in reference planes\nPI, PR and PT respectively; rI , rR and rT are the transverse coordinates of an arbitrary\npoint r of the boundary measured in \"own\" frames associated with the incident, reflected\nand refracted beams. Further explanations see in text.\n\n\fRelations between the three beams follow from the continuity conditions for the tangential\ncomponents of the electric and magnetic fields \u2013 in fact, we operate in the usual way that gives the\nknown Fresnel coefficients [11] but apply it to transversely confined paraxial beams rather than to\nplane waves. This requires some modifications of the known scheme; the main one is that any\nparaxial beam is naturally described only in its own cross section. Such reference cross sections are\nformed by planes Pj defined by equations z j = 0 ; these planes are orthogonal to axes z j , and axis\n\ny is their common intersection (Fig. 1). All the reference planes are not real cross sections of the\ncorresponding beams: e.g., the incident beam does not exist in the part of plane PI above the\nboundary but it is suitable to characterize the incident beam by the complex amplitude distribution\nwhich would take place in plane PI if the whole half-space z I < 0 were a homogeneous medium\nwith refraction index nI . Similarly, the reflected and refracted complex amplitude distributions in\nthe reference planes PR and PT form the initial conditions for the corresponding beams that are\nsupposed to propagate in continuous homogeneous media with indices nI and nT 1 .\nOur task is to link the complex amplitude distribution of the incident beam\nP1 , with functions\nu XI ,Y ( x I , y ,0 ) \u2261 u XI ,Y ( x I , y ) , defined in the reference plane\nu XR ,Y ( xR , y ,0 ) \u2261 u XR ,Y ( xR , y ) and u TX ,Y ( xT , y ,0 ) \u2261 u TX ,Y ( xT , y ) that characterize the secondary beams\n\nin their associated reference planes PR and PT . It should be noted that boundary conditions at the\ninterface N cannot be immediately applied to these functions: at the boundary, the complex\namplitudes differ from their values in the reference planes with z j = 0 . To find the beam fields in\npoints where z j slightly differs from zero, one should employ Eq. (2) due to which, in the first\norder in \u03b3 (first paraxial approximation),\nu Xj ,Y ( x j , y , z j ) = u Xj ,Y ( x j , y ) +\n\n(\n\n)\n\niz j\n2k j\n\n\u2207 2j u Xj ,Y ( x j , y ) ,\n\n(11)\n\n\u2207 j = \u2202 \u2202x j , \u2202 \u2202y . For every beam involved, plane N is an oblique cross section for which\n(12)\nz j = x j tan \u03b8 j .\nNow we are in a position to write down the necessary tangential components of the electric and\nmagnetic vectors. In accordance with (1) and (11), (12), components orthogonal to the incidence\nplane are associated with the y -oriented field vectors:\nE\u22a5j = uYj ( x j , y , x j tan \u03b8 j ) exp ( ik j x j tan \u03b8 j ) ,\n\nH \u22a5j = n j u Xj ( x j , y , x j tan \u03b8 j ) exp ( ik j x j tan \u03b8 j ) .\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nThis representation is quite similar to its counterpart known in the case of plane-wave incidence\n[11]. However, the in-plane field components include contributions owing to the longitudinal field\n(3), and this is the main difference from the usual case:\n\u23a1\n\u23a4\ni\n(15)\nE||j = \u23a2 cos\u03b8 j u Xj ( x j , y , x j tan \u03b8 j ) + sin \u03b8 j wEj ( x j , y ) \u23a5 exp ( ik j x j tan \u03b8 j ) ,\nkj\n\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a1\n\u23a4\ni\n(16)\nH ||j = n j \u23a2 \u2212 cos\u03b8 j uYj ( x j , y , x j tan \u03b8 j ) + sin \u03b8 j wHj ( x j , y ) \u23a5 exp ( ik j x j tan \u03b8 j )\nkj\n\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a5\u23a6\nwhere\n1\n\nSuch a choice of reference planes is convenient in calculations and makes no trouble for interpretations because any of\nthe three beams can only be observed at a certain distance from the boundary, where it is situated entirely within the\ncorresponding homogeneous medium.\n\n\fj\nE\n\nw\n\n(x , y) =\nj\n\n(x , y) =\n\n\u2202u Xj ( x j , y )\n\u2202x j\n\n\u2202u Xj ( x j , y )\n\n+\n\n\u2202uYj ( x j , y )\n\u2202y\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\n\u2202uYj ( x j , y )\n\n.\n(18)\n\u2212\n\u2202y\n\u2202x j\nFormally, Eqs.

However, the \"longitudinal\" terms of (15) and (16) 'per se' are of the\nfirst order of smallness due to k j in denominators, so the second terms of (11) would provide the\nj\nH\n\nw\n\nj\n\nsecond-order corrections and are thus neglected in the derivatives of (17) and (18).\nThen, expressions (13) \u2013 (18) should be substituted into the usual continuity conditions [11]\n(19)\nE\u22a5I + E\u22a5R = E\u22a5T , H \u22a5I + H \u22a5R = H \u22a5T ;\nE&I + E&R = E&T , H &I + H &R = H &T\n\n(20)\n\nwhich, together with (13) \u2013 (18), yield four equations to determine the four unknowns u\nand u\n\nT\nX ,Y\n\n( xT , y )\n\nfor given complex amplitudes of the incident beam u\n\nI\nX ,Y\n\nR\nX ,Y\n\n( xR , y )\n\n( xI , y ) . Note that in Eqs.\n\n(13) \u2013 (18), spatial functions pertaining to the j-th beam are expressed in their own coordinates; in\nfact, they relate to the same points of the boundary plane (see relations between rI, rR and rT in Fig.\n1) and the x-coordinates in different terms of (13) \u2013 (18) are linked by equations\nxR = \u2212 x I , xT cos \u03b8 I = x I cos \u03b8T .\n(21)\nIn the \"differential\" terms of (17), (18), substitution (21), if necessary, should be made after the\ndifferentiation with respect to the \"own\" x j is performed.\nAfter substitution of expressions (13) \u2013 (16) into (19), (20), we obtain a complete set of\nconditions determining the vector beam transformation at a plane boundary. They can be solved by\nsuccessive approximations. First, in view of Eqs. (10) and (21), all the exponential multipliers in\n(13) \u2013 (16) appear to be identical and may be omitted.

(21).\nEqs. (27) \u2013 (31) represent a vector generalization of the scalar formulae obtained before\n[22,23]. The vector nature of the optical field manifests itself by the fact that Eqs. (27), (28)\ndetermining \u03b4 u XR ,T , contain not only the in-plane incident field u XI but also derivatives of the\nC& =\n\northogonal component uYI , and Eqs. (29), (30) for \u03b4 uYR ,T contain contributions of u XI . Interestingly,\nthese \"vector\" modifications involve derivatives with respect to the \"off-plane\" coordinate y .\nWithout them, Eqs. (27) \u2013 (30) can be reduced to relations derived in Refs. [22,23] for a boundary\nwith diffraction grating if the grating period tends to infinity (\"smooth\" interface). Indeed, due to\nrelations\ndR\ndT\ndR\nn dT&\n1\n1\ntan \u03b8 I T\u22a52C& = \u2212 \u22a5 = \u2212 \u22a5 ,\ntan \u03b8 I T&2 C& = \u2212 T\n=\u2212 & ,\n(32)\n2\nnI d\u03b8 I\nd\u03b8 I\n2\nd\u03b8 I\nd\u03b8 I\nthe terms of Eqs. (27) \u2013 (30), proportional to derivatives with respect to xI , can be expressed via the\nangular derivatives of the corresponding transformation coefficients, as is suggested by the angularspectrum-based reasoning [4,22] 2 . Importantly, no special requirements were imposed so far\nrelating the real or complex values of nI and nT , and expressions (23) \u2013 (31), though presented\n2\n\nIn Refs. [22,23] the plane wave transformation at the boundary is characterized by \"amplitude efficiencies\"\n\n\u03c4 (\u03b8 I ) = nT cos\u03b8T nI cos\u03b8 I T&, \u22a5 (\u03b8 I )\n\nrather than by the \"pure\" transmission coefficients T&, \u22a5 (\u03b8 I ) ; this results\n\nin additional summands in the expression of\n\nd\u03c4 d\u03b8 I as compared to dT&, \u22a5 d\u03b8 I , which apparently caused additional\n\nterms with x -derivatives in formulae for the secondary beam deformations of [22,23].\n\n\fformally for a dielectric interface, are applicable in cases where one or both contacting media are\nconductive.\nThe reflected/refracted beam spatial configuration described by Eqs. (23), (24) and (27) \u2013 (30)\ncompletely coincides with what follows from the traditional approach based on the plane-wave\nexpansion [4,9] in the first order in \u03b3 . However, the presented way of reasoning discloses some\nnew important aspects of the beam transformation. Note that all terms with first derivatives in (27)\n\u2013 (30) appear due to the longitudinal component of the incident field. It is important to emphasize\nthat the longitudinal component of the incident beam contributes to formation of the transverse\ncomponents of the reflected and refracted beams. Therefore, while in the incident field the small\ncorrections of the order \u03b3 were orthogonal to the \"main\" transverse field and did not disturb the\nbeam energy distribution in the first paraxial order (see notes below Eq. (9)), in the secondary\n(reflected/refracted) beams, the first-order perturbation \"penetrates\" into the transverse components\nand can cause quite perceptible distortions of their spatial profile. The terms of Eqs. (27) \u2013 (30)\nproportional to \u2202 \u2202x I describe distortions \"oriented\" parallel to the incidence plane; generally, they\nare responsible for the \"in-plane\" beam shift known as the Goos\u2013H\u00e4nchen shift [4,9,10], the best\nobservable in conditions of the total reflection. The \"out-of-plane\" Imbert\u2013Fedorov shift [3,4],\northogonal to the incidence plane, is associated with terms containing \u2202 \u2202y . Our present\nconsideration shows that both effects can be treated as immediate consequences of the nontransversality of the incident beam field and directly originate from its longitudinal component.\n3. The secondary beam shift\nTo demonstrate equivalence of the presented approach and the previously developed models\n[3\u20139], let us determine the lateral shift of the refracted beam described by Eqs. (23), (27), (29). In\ngeneral, the center of gravity coordinates for the j-th beam are defined as\n\u23a7x\u23ab j 2\nj 2\n\u23a8 \u23ac u X + uY dx j dy\nj\n\u222b\n\u23a7 x0 \u23ab\n\u23a9 y\u23ad\n(33)\n\u23a8 j\u23ac=\nj 2\nj 2\n\u23a9 y0 \u23ad\nu\nu\ndx\ndy\n+\nY\nj\n\u222b X\n\n(\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(integration over the whole beam cross section is implied). Terms x0R ,T correspond to the Goos \u2013\nH\u00e4nchen shift; the center of gravity displacements orthogonal to the incidence plane (Imbert \u2013\nFedorov shifts) are associated with y0R ,T Hence, in application to the refracted beam, we have\ny\n\n+\n\nT\n0\n\n{\n\n\u222b y( u\n=\n\u222b( u\n\nT 2\nX\n\nT 2\nX\n\n+ uYT\n\n) dx dy \u2248 \u222b y (T u\n) dx dy \u222b (T u\n\n2\n\n+ uYT\n\n2\n&\n\nT\n\n2\n\n2\n&\n\nT\n\nI 2\nX\n\nI 2\nX\n\n2\n\n+ T\u22a52 uYI\n\n+ T\u22a52 uYI\n\n) dx dy\nI\n\n2\n\n) dx dy\nI\n\n}\n\n\u23a1( u I )\u2217 \u03b4 u T + u I (\u03b4 u T )\u2217 \u23a4 + T \u23a1( u I )\u2217 \u03b4 u T + u I (\u03b4 u T )\u2217 \u23a4 dx dy\ny\nT\n&\n\u222b \u23a2\u23a3 X X X X \u23a5\u23a6 \u22a5 \u23a2\u23a3 Y Y Y Y \u23a5\u23a6 I\n\n\u222b (T\n\n2\n&\n\nu\n\nI 2\nX\n\nI 2\nY\n\n+T u\n2\n\u22a5\n\n) dx dy\n\n(34)\n\nI\n\n(asterisk, as usual, denotes the complex conjugate, and both media are supposed dielectric so that\ntransmission coefficients (25), (26) are real). If the incident beam possesses circular symmetry (e.g.,\nis Gaussian), the first summand in the right-hand side of (34) vanishes, while in the second\nsummand (second line of (34)), only terms containing derivatives with respect to y can give nonzero contributions. Consequently, expression in figure brackets of (34) may be replaced by\n*\n*\n\u23a7\n\u23a1\n\u23a1\nI\nI\n\u2202 ( uYI ) \u23a4\n\u2202 ( u XI ) \u23a4 \u23aa\u23ab\n* \u2202u\ni\n\u23aa nI \u23a2 I * \u2202uY\nI\nI\nI\nX\n\u23a5 \u2212 T\u22a5 \u23a2 ( uY )\n\u23a5\u23ac .\n\u2212 uX\n\u2212 uY\ntan \u03b8 I T\u22a5T&C\u22a5 \u23a8 T& ( u X )\n(35)\nn\ny\ny\ny\ny\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n2k I\n\u23a2\n\u23a5\n\u23a2\n\u23a5\nT\n\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\n\u23a3\n\u23a6 \u23aa\u23ad\n\n\fThis expression includes only parameters of the incident beam profile and we may omit the superand subscripts \" I \" in further analysis. Now suppose the incident beam to be homogeneously\npolarized; together with assumed circular symmetry this means that Eqs. (5) and (7) are true. If,\nadditionally, the complex amplitude function u ( x, y ) is real (e.g., the beam waist plane coincides\nwith the reference plane\n\n(T\n\n2\n&\n\n+ \u03b2 T\u22a52\n2\n\nPI , Fig. 1), denominator of Eq.

(36) and (37) can be\nreduced to Eq. (58) of Ref. [4].\nThe angular Goos \u2013 H\u00e4nchen and Imbert \u2013 Fedorov shifts [3,4] can be found by a similar\nprocedure which, instead of (33), starts with expression for the mean tilt of the secondary beam\ntrajectory [15,22,27]\n\u23a1( u j )* \u2207 u j + ( u j )* \u2207 u j \u23a4 dx dy\nj\nj X\nY\nj Y \u23a5\n\u239b px 0 \u239e\ni \u222b \u23a2\u23a3 X\n\u23a6 j\n( j = R, T )\n\u239c\u239c j \u239f\u239f = \u2212\nj 2\nj 2\nkj\nu\n+\nu\ndx\ndy\n\u239d py0 \u23a0\nY\nj\n\u222b X\n\n(\n\nwhere p xj0 = n j\n\n)\n\ndx0j\ndy j\nand p yj 0 = n j 0 .\ndz j\ndz j\n\n4. Conclusion\nWe have considered transformation of a paraxial beam upon reflection and/or refraction at a\nplane boundary between two homogeneous media. In contrast to the usual approaches based on the\nfield representation via the plane-wave spectrum (in the momentum space) [3\u201310], our\nconsideration relies upon the real-space arguments. It starts with representation of a vector paraxial\nbeam via complex amplitudes of orthogonally polarized components, valid in the first order of\nparaxial approximation (first order in the divergence angle \u03b3 ). The main feature of this\nrepresentation is explicit presence of the longitudinal field component. Analysis of the beam\ntransformation at the boundary is performed by direct generalization of the usual procedure\ndeveloped for plane waves and commonly used for obtaining the Fresnel laws for the refraction and\nreflection coefficients [11]. Deviations from the geometric picture of the beam transformation are\n\n\fconsidered as immediate consequences of the first-order corrections to the incident beam spatial\nstructure. In particular, it is the longitudinal electric and magnetic fields of the incident beam that\ngive rise to such known post-geometric effects as the polarization-dependent Goos \u2013 H\u00e4nchen and\nImbert \u2013 Fedorov shifts. Especially, the Imbert \u2013 Fedorov shift of the beam center of gravity can be\ntreated as a manifestation of the polarization-sensitive vortex structure of the incident beam\nlongitudinal component. In the course of reflection or refraction, this vortex structure partly\n\"penetrates\" into transverse components of the reflected and refracted beams and causes the\nobservable spin-dependent distortion of their spatial profiles. This reveals relationship between the\nImbert \u2013 Fedorov shift at a plane boundary and the lateral shift of a focal spot [17] \u2013 another spin\nHall effect manifestation that also appears due to the longitudinal field modification caused by\nswitching the sign of circular polarization. In both phenomena, the longitudinal field of the initial\nparaxial beam appears as a crucial element of the mechanism by which the spin-orbit interaction is\nrealized. In conjunction with the decisive role that the longitudinal component plays in the spin-toorbit angular momentum conversion upon the light beam focusing [19\u201321] or scattering [24], this\nleads to suggestion of the special importance of the longitudinal field in other spin-orbit phenomena\ninvolving paraxial beams, which should be clarified in further research.\nThe \"real-space\" approach to the beam transformation at a plane boundary appears to be\ncompletely equivalent to the usual plane-wave-spectrum method of analysis. However, the\npresented way of operation, essentially based on pictorial geometric arguments, may be useful in\nsome methodical aspects. Its final results (Eqs. (27) \u2013 (30) with known auxiliary relations (23) and\n(24)) are valid for arbitrary paraxial beam and describe, from the common point of view, not only\nspin-dependent effects but also the beam transformations owing to its internal spatial structure (e.g.,\norbital Hall effect [15,25,26]). We hope the method of this paper will be useful in further studies of\nthe optical spin Hall phenomena, including elucidation of the role and manifestation of the internal\nenergy flows [15].\nAcknowledgements\nThe author is grateful to K.
