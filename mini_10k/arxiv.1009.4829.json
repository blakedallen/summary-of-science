In particular, a class of bottom-up models has been\nproposed [3\u20135], inspired by noncritical string theory descriptions, in which a natively non-supersymmetric framework\nis set up in a five-dimensional AdS-like space, together with a mechanism of breaking conformal symmetry, in order\nto catch some desired degrees of freedom of QCD at strong coupling. We focus on the Soft-Wall model [4, 5], which\nis constructed in a non-dynamical AdS5 space, whose line element is, in Poincar\u00e9 coordinates,\nds2 =\n\n\u0001\nR2\ndt2 \u2212 dxi dxi \u2212 dz 2\n2\nz\n\nz>0\n\ni = 1, 2, 3 .\n\n(1)\n\nQCD is defined on the boundary z = 0 of AdS5 and the fifth \"holographic\" coordinate z represents an inverse\nrenormalization scale [2, 3]. In this model the conformal symmetry (proper of AdS spaces) is broken by inserting an\nexternal non-dynamical dilatonlike profile e\u2212\u03c6(z) in the action. In order to obtain Regge trajectories for hadron states,\n\u03c6(z) must contain powers of z not higher than z 2 [4], so the simplest choice is \u03c6(z) = \u00b1c2 z 2 (the parameter c \u223c \u039bQCD\nin the exponent is the only mass scale of the model). We call the correspondent models SW\u00b1 , respectively. After the\nseminal papers [4, 5] the SW+ has been investigated in many aspects in many subsequent works. Topics that have\nbeen studied include hadron spectra, decay constants and strong couplings [6\u201310], form factors [11], deconfinement\n[12, 13], finite temperature effects [14\u201317], condensates [9, 18], deep inelastic scattering and structure functions [19].\nThe SW\u2212 firstly appeared in [20], to extract the static interquark potential through the investigation of the properties\nof an Euclidean rectangular Wilson loop. However, in [20] the negative sign of the dilaton was interpreted as an effect\nof the Wick rotation from the Minkowskian to the Euclidean signature. Recently, the possibility to use the negative\nbackground in the Minkowski space for the holographic Soft-Wall model of QCD has been proposed in [21, 22]. The\nmain motivation adducted to justify this proposal is that the positive dilaton background does not verify the sufficient\nconditions for the geometry found in [23] to produce a confining static potential. On the contrary, switching the sign\nof \u03c6(z) generates linear confinement, as shown in [20] for zero temperature and chemical potential, and for T > 0 and\n\u03bc > 0 case in [24].\nIn [4], the possibility of considering a negative dilaton profile had been discarded because it would have brought to\na massless ground state for \u03c1 mesons, which is phenomenologically not acceptable. This is a very important point,\nsince the main parameter of the model, the scale c, is usually fixed from the mass of the \u03c10 , and we will discuss it in\nthe following. The effective action introduced to study vector mesons and chiral symmetry breaking is [4]\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n1\n\u221a\nSef f =\n.\n(2)\nd5 x g e\u2212\u03c6 Tr |DX|2 + 3X 2 + 2 FV2 + FA2\nk\n2g5\nFVMN = \u2202 M V N \u2212 \u2202 N V M \u2212 i[V M , V N ] \u2212 i[AM , AN ], FAMN = \u2202 M AN \u2212 \u2202 N AM \u2212 i[V M , AN ] \u2212 i[AM , V N ] are the\ngauge connections of the vector and axial fields V M = (LM + RM )/2 and AM = (LM \u2212 RM )/2, where LM and\n\u03bc\nRM are dual to the four dimensional conserved currents jL/R\n= q\u0304L/R \u03b3 \u03bc T a qL/R .

The field dual\nto the vector current JV\u03bc = q\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc q, which represents the vector mesons, is VM (x, z). Defining B(z) = (\u03c6 + log(z/R)) /2,\nafter transforming \u03c8(q 2 , z) = e\u2212B(z) V (q 2 , z), where V (q 2 , z) is a generic component of V\u03bc , we obtain a Schr\u00f6dingerlike equation of motion for the rotated field \u03c8(q 2 , z) in Fourier space (in the axial gauge Vz = 0, where the field V\u03bc is\ntransverse: \u2202\u03bc V \u03bc = 0):\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3\n\u2212 \u03c8 \u2032\u2032 + c4 z 2 + 2 \u03c8 = q 2 \u03c8 ,\n(3)\n4z\nindependently of the choice of the sign of \u03c6(z) (the prime denotes a derivative with respect to z). This means that\nequation (3) must admit the same set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in both the SW\u00b1 . The vector meson spectrum\nis [4]\nm2n = 4c2 (n + 1) ,\n\nn = 0, 1, 2 . . . .\n\n(4)\n\nThis shows that no massless ground state appears when one reverses the sign of the dilaton profile. One can also check\nthat the solution of equation (3) with q 2 = 0, which would correspond to a massless hadron, is not square integrable.\nFrom the spectrum (4) we fix the value of the mass scale of the model, c = m\u03c1 /2 for both SW\u00b1 .\nThis point can be further investigate by analyzing the two-point correlation function of the vector current JV\u03bc =\nq\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc q. To do this, we need to evaluate the bulk-to-boundary propagator of the vector field, which is a regular (i.e.\nfree of IR essential singularities) solution of (3) with boundary condition V (q 2 , 0) = 1; we find V (q 2 , z) = \u0393(1 \u2212\n2 2\nq 2 /4c2 ) e\u2212c z U (\u2212q 2 /4c2 , 0, c2 z 2 ), where U is the Tricomi confluent hypergeometric function. We can holographically\nevaluate the two-point correlator:\n2 2\n\nec z\nV (q 2 , z)\u2202z V (q 2 , z)\nq2 z\nz\u21920\n\u0001\u0003\n1 \u0002\n2\n2\n\u22124c \u2212 q \u03b3 + H(\u2212q 2 /4c2 ) + log(c2 /\u03bd 2 )\n\u221d\n2\n2q\n\n\u03a0(q 2 ) \u221d\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u03bd a renormalization scale and H(x) the harmonic number function. The factor \u22122c2 /q 2 does not really give rise\nto a physical pole, since it can be subtracted as a contact term, being the function in the square brackets defined apart\nfrom an additive constant. After this subtraction, we find that the position of the poles of \u03a0(q 2 ) coincide exactly with\nthe mass spectrum (4) evaluated looking for normalizable states, as it should be.\nAt this point, once one of the main reasons for the rejection of this model has been ruled out, we proceed in\ninvestigating chiral symmetry breaking and scalar mesons. Chiral symmetry breaking was one of the first topic\nstudied within the Soft-Wall model [4]. Later, scalar mesons have been added to complete the picture [7]. The\nequation of motion for v(z) = 2X0 (z) in the SW\u2212 , derived from (2), is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\n3\nv \u2032\u2032 + 2c2 z \u2212\nv\u2032 + 2 v = 0\n(6)\nz\nz\n\u0001\n2 2\nand its solution is v(z) = A v1 (z) + B v2 (z), with v1 (z) = e\u2212c z cz U \u22121/2, 0, c2z 2 and v2 (z) =\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2 2\ne\u2212c z cz L 1/2, \u22121, c2z 2 . Then, one would fix A = \u03c0 mq /(Rc) and B \u2212 A(1 + \u03b3E \u2212 ln 4)/2 \u03c0 = \u2212hq\u0304qi/3 =\n\u2212\u03c3/(Rc)3 , with mq = 2.29 MeV and \u03c3 = (327 MeV)3 in order to describe both explicit and spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking, as in the Hard-Wall model [3]. Both solutions are acceptable because they do not contain essential singularities. We remind that in the SW+ ,the solution for v(z) proportional to z 3 must be discarded, since it has an infrared\nessential singularity; this provokes the appearance of a proportionality law between mq and \u03c3, absent in QCD. As\nbeen suggested in [22], changing the sign of the dilaton \u03c6(z) (i.e. considering the SW\u2212 ) could be a way to solve this\nproblem, absorbing the essential singularity into the background. Nevertheless, we observe that the problem is not\nreally solved, since, even if both solutions are regular in the bulk, the on-shell action becomes divergent, because of\n2 2\nthe piece not proportional to e\u2212c z at z \u2192 \u221e in v2 .\nWe now proceed in investigating the scalar meson sector. The bulk-to-boundary propagator of the scalar field\ne\nS(q 2 , z) is solution of the equation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3 e\n3 e\u2032\n2\n\u2032\u2032\n2\ne\nS + q + 2 S=0\n(7)\nS + 2c z +\nz\nz\n\n\f3\ne 2 , z) = 1, and giving an IR finite on-shell action: S(q\ne 2 , z) = \u0393(1/2 \u2212\nwith boundary condition limz\u21920 (R/z) S(q\n\u0001\n2\n2\n\u2212c2 z 2\n2\n2\n2 2\nq /4c ) (z/R) e\nU \u22121/2 \u2212 q /4c , 0, c z . We can then get the two-point correlator\nR3 e 2\ne\u2212\u03c6 e 2\n, z)\nS(q , z) 3 \u2202z S(q\nk\nz\nz\u21920\n\u0012\n\u001b\n\u0014\n\u001a\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0001\n\u0001\nq2\nR\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\nAB\n1 + \u03b3E \u2212 2 ln c \u01eb \u2212 2\u03c8 1/2 \u2212 2\n\u2212 6c\nq + 2c\n= \u03b4\n2k\n4c\n\n2\nAB\n\u03a0AB\nAdS (q ) = \u03b4\n\n(8)\n\nand, comparing its expansion for \u2212q 2 \u2192 \u221e with the known QCD one [25] we can fix R/k = Nc /16\u03c0 2 , neglecting\nnon-perturbative (e.g. instanton-like) contributions. The two-point function has a set of poles, whose positions give\nhadron masses, with corresponding residues\nm2n = 2c2 (2n + 1) ,\n\nFn2 =\n\nNc 4\nc (n + 1) .\n\u03c02\n\n(9)\n\nThe square roots of the residues, Fn , represent the hadron decay constants. The states are organized in Regge\ntrajectories (9), with the same slope as scalar glueballs or vector mesons [4]. One effect of reversing the sign of the\ndilaton field is to decrease the mass of the ground state, as already pointed out in [22], to m2S0 = 549 MeV, while\nthe residues are left unchanged with respect to the SW+ . Given the above value of the mass, the ground state could\nbe interpreted as the isoscalar f0 (600) (or \u03c3) meson, even if the precise position of the corresponding pole is difficult\nto establish experimentally because of its large width, and because it cannot be modeled by a naive Breit-Wigner\nresonance [26]. The decay constant of the ground state, obtained from (9), is F0 = 0.08 GeV2 . The value of the\nfour dimensional gluon condensate is extracted in the limit mq = 0, h\u03b1s /\u03c0 G2 i = 2c4 /\u03c0 2 \u2243 0.004 GeV4 and is\nleft unchanged by switching the sign of the dilaton profile [7]. An important improvement brought by the SW\u2212\nconcerns the dimension\u0001 six operator. Here, in fact, using the factorization approximation in QCD, one can match the\n\u221a\ncorresponding O 1/q 4 terms in (8) and [25], obtaining, in the limit mq \u2192 0, \u03c0\u03b1s hq\u0304qi \u2243 (154 MeV)3 . This result\n+\nwas not present in the SW , in which the two terms cannot be matched since they have an opposite sign.\nAnother drawback of the SW+ concerns the coupling of the scalar mesons with two pseudoscalars, which turns\nout to be too small with respect to the one known from phenomenology. Now we evaluate such a coupling in the\nSW\u2212 . The field involved in the holographic description of the pseudoscalar mesons are the chiral field \u03c0 and the\nlongitudinal part \u03c6 of the axial field A\u03bc , defined by A\u03bc = A\u03bc\u22a5 + \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 (in the axial gauge Az = Vz = 0). Defining the\npseudoscalar field \u03c8 a = \u03c6a \u2212 \u03c0 a , the part of the action involving one scalar and two pseudoscalar mesons is, for the\noctet contribution,\nZ\nR3 abc\n1\n(SP P )\nSef f\n=\u2212\n(10)\nd\nd5 x 3 e\u2212\u03c6(z) v(z) S8a \u03b7 MN (\u2202M \u03c8 b )(\u2202N \u03c8 c ) .\nk\nz\nWith the identification [7] \u03c8ePa (q, z) = (1/q 2 ) A(0, z)(\u2212iq \u03bc \u00c3ak 0 \u03bc (q)), where A(q 2 , z) is the Fourier transform of the\nea (q 2 , z) = A(q 2 , z)A\nea (q 2 ), for the n-th scalar radial excitation,\nbulk-to-boundary propagator of the axial field, A\n\u22a5\u03bc\n\u22a50\u03bc\nthe explicit form for the coupling with two pions is\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\n8R2 c4\nm2n\n2\n2\n1 2 2\n(11)\nA(0,\nz)\ng Sn P P =\ndz\nv(z)\nL\n(c\nz\n)\n(\u2202\nA(0,\nz))\n+\nz\nn\nkf\u03c02 Fn 0\n2\nwith f\u03c0 the pion decay constant and Fn given by (9). Using a numerical solution for A(0, z) and the value f\u03c0 \u2243 88 MeV\n(result of this model), for n = 0 we find gS0 P P \u2243 345 MeV. If we assume that the S0 eigenfunction describes the\n\u03c3(600) meson, we can evaluate the corresponding width, since the \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decay is dominant with repect to the only\nother seen one, \u03c3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. We can then assume \u0393\u03c3 \u2243 \u0393(\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) + \u0393(\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ). This is given in terms of gS0 P P ,\nm\u03c0 and mS0 as\n\u0393\u03c3 =\n\n3 gS2 0 P P q 4\n3\nmS0 \u2212 4m4\u03c0 \u2243 6.4 MeV\n\u0393(\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) =\n2\n32 \u03c0 m3S0\n\n(12)\n\nhaving used a pion mass value m\u03c0 = 144 MeV obtained from the Gell-Mann\u2013Oakes\u2013Renner relation f\u03c02 m2\u03c0 = 2mq \u03c3.\nThe result is very small, at odds with the total width of the \u03c3(600) meson, which is of O(600 \u2212 1000 MeV) [26]. Then,\neven if the SW\u2212 allows to solve the known drawback of the SW+ of having independent description of spontaneous\nand explicit chiral symmetry breaking, making possible to consider the two independent solutions for v(z) and to\nintroduce separately the quark mass and the chiral condensate, the coupling of scalar mesons to two pions turns out\n\n\f4\nto be too small than the one expected from known phenomenology. One could justify this issue stating that the\nground state does not represent the \u03c3 meson (which in fact cannot be easily described as a pure q q\u0304 meson [27]), but\nit is anyway difficult to explain a lowest lying q q\u0304 state having such a small mass.\nWe conclude observing that, though in this respect it does not provide a fully satisfactory description of the light\nmeson sector, the SW\u2212 certainly deserves to be studied more deeply and improved, since it is able to reproduce some\nkey features of QCD that are absent in the SW+ .\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to join the Organizers of the workshop in warmly remembering Beppe Nardulli, as a man of irony,\nscience and hard work.\nThis work was supported in part by the EU contract No. MRTN-CT-2006-035482, \"FLAVIAnet\".\n\n[1] J.
