This establishes the fact\nthat useful quantum information processing can be accomplished by quantum statistics alone. Due to the basis independence of statistical effects, our\nprotocol requires less knowledge of the initial state than most entanglement\nconcentration schemes. Moreover, no explicit controlled operation is required\nat any stage.\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fQuantum statistics has led to a number of interesting phenomena such as ferromagnetism, superconductivity and superfluidity. However, its effects have never been used to\nprocess information. Recently, we have shown that quantum statistics can lead to an effective interaction between internal and external degrees of freedom of particles [1]. This was\ndemonstrated in the context of entanglement transfer from spin to path without an explicit\nconditional operation between these degrees of freedom. It was also shown that the extent\nof this transfer depended on the bosonic or fermionic nature of the particles [1]. Going\neven further in our exploration of the effects of quantum statistics in information theory,\nwe present an entanglement concentration protocol [2,3] based on these effects. This establishes the fact that quantum statistics alone (without any other explicit interaction between\nthe relevant degrees of freedom of the particles involved) is sufficient for useful quantum\ninformation processing.\nThe best performances in quantum communication and computation processes are normally achieved using a pair of pure maximally entangled systems (particles) shared between\ndistant parties. But the inevitable influence of the environment during the distribution of\nthe entangled pairs reduces the amount of shared entanglement. As entanglement cannot\nbe increased by local operations and classical communication [4], the only option is to concentrate it locally from a larger to a smaller number of pairs [2,3,5\u201311]. In the case of mixed\nstates we call these protocols entanglement purification, while for pure states we refer to\nthem as entanglement concentration [3].\nIn a setting similar to previous entanglement concentration protocols, we consider the\naction of specific local operations on two pairs of entangled systems, driving them with some\nprobability into one pair of more entangled systems.\nHowever, unlike most of the previous schemes, we require our entangled systems to be\ncomposed of n particles (see Fig. 1 for the representation of a pair of these systems). We\nlook at the entanglement in the internal degrees of freedom of the particles, such as the spin\nin the case of electrons (fermions) or the polarization in the case of photons (bosons), which\nhave isomorphic Hilbert spaces. The initial pure state of each of our two pairs, distributed\n2\n\n\fbetween two parties Alice (A) and Bob (B), is:\n|\u03c6in \u2261 \u03b1| \u2191\u2191 * * * \u2191 iA | \u2193\u2193 * * * \u2193iB + \u03b2| \u2193\u2193 * * * \u2193iA | \u2191\u2191 * * * \u2191iB\n|\n\n{z\nn\n\n(1)\n\n}\n\nwith |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1 and where, for instance, we have:\n+\n+\ne n\n| \u2191\u2191 * * * \u2191 iA = \u00e2+\nA1\u2191 \u00e2A2\u2191 * * * \u00e2An\u2191 |0i \u2261 |A\u2191i .\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u00e2+ are creation operators that ensure the ordering of the multi-particle state, as the\nusual commutation and anti-commutation rules apply for bosons and fermions respectively.\nFor sake of compactness, we will rewrite equation (1) as:\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n + \u03b2|A\u2193i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n ,\n|\u03c6in = \u03b1|A\u2191i\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the tilde over the arrow reminds us of the string of spins (or polarizations).\nLet us now label one pair L and the other R (as in left and right \u2013 see Fig. 2). Then,\nour total initial state is:\n|\u03c6in \u2261 |\u03c6inL \u2297 |\u03c6inR ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere |\u03c6inL is given by equation (1) written for pair L, and similarly for R.\nUsing equation (3), we can rewrite the total state (4) as:\ne n |A\u2191i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n + \u03b2 2 |A\u2193i\ne n |A\u2193i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n\n|\u03c6in = \u03b12 |A\u2191i\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ne n |A\u2193i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n + |A\u2193i\ne n |A\u2191i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n .\n+ \u03b1\u03b2 |A\u2191i\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\n\n(5)\n\nOur protocol consists of bringing each of Bob's particles into a 50/50 beam splitter\n(particles i from the left and the right systems go into beam splitter i, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n)\nand then making a specific measurement on the output particles using detectors Li and Ri\n(see Fig. 2). Before the particles from the left fall into the beam splitter, we apply to each\nof them a specific unitary transformation U\u03c0i , that flips their spin or polarization. This is\ndone in the arm li of each beam splitter and the transformation is defined for every i:\n\n3\n\n\fU\u03c0i :\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n|B \u2191ili \u2192 |B \u2193ili\n\n(6)\n\n.\n\n|B \u2193ili \u2192 |B \u2191ili\n\nThis flipping is applied in order to align some spins (or polarizations) in appropriate terms\nso that we can exploit the statistical effects later on.\nThe total state then becomes:\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n|\u03c60 in \u2261 U\u03c01 \u2297 U\u03c02 \u2297 * * * \u2297 U\u03c0n |\u03c6in\ne n |A\u2191i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n + \u03b2 2 |A\u2193i\ne n |A\u2193i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n\n= \u03b12 |A\u2191i\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\ne n |A\u2193i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n + |A\u2193i\ne n |A\u2191i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n .\n+ \u03b1\u03b2 |A\u2191i\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\n\n(7)\n\nFirst, we present the entanglement concentration protocol for fermions (e.g. electrons)\nand then the counterpart protocol for bosons (e.g. photons).\nFermions \u2013 After passing through the beam splitter, Bob performs path measurement\non the first pair of particles coming out of the beam splitter using detectors L1 and R1 (see\nFig. 2). For simplicity of presentation, we first assume that these detectors do not absorb\nthe particles and do not disturb their internal degrees of freedom (such detectors are indeed\navailable for electrons and atoms and can have interesting applications in deterministically\nentangling independent particles using indistinguishability and feedback [12]). However, as\nwe will show later on, this is not a necessary requirement for success of our protocol. If the\nparticles (which we assumed to be fermions) bunch, we discard them.

Thus, the state |\u03c61 i differs from |\u03c60 i in the first two\nterms (we \"normalize\" their amplitudes \u03b12 and \u03b2 2 by the factor\n\n\u221a1 ).\n2\n\nAfter obtaining the anti-bunching result, we can now let the second pair of Bob's particles\n(l2 and r2) pass through another 50/50 beam splitter and perform the same measurement,\ndiscarding again the bunching results.\nAfter repeating the same procedure n times, we get the state:\n|\u03c6n in = Nn\n\nwith\n\n\"\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03b12 e n e n\n\u03b22 e n e n\n\u2297n\n\u2297n\n+ n |A\u2193i\nn |A\u2191iL |A\u2191iR |B tripleti\nL |A\u2193iR |B tripleti\n22\n22\n\ne n |A\u2193i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n + |A\u2193i\ne n |A\u2191i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n\n+ \u03b1\u03b2 |A\u2191i\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\n\"\n\n|\u03b1|4 |\u03b2|4\n+ n + 2|\u03b1\u03b2|2\nNn =\nn\n2\n2\n\n#\u2212 1\n\n\u0011i\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nThe probability of getting |\u03c6n i from |\u03c6n\u22121 i is:\npn =\n\n\u0012\n\nNn\u22121\nNn\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nSo, the total probability for getting |\u03c6n in from |\u03c60 in is:\np\u0303n =\n\nn\nY\n\ni=1\n\n(n\u2192\u221e)\n\npi = Nn\u22122 \u2212\u2192 2|\u03b1\u03b2|2 \u2261 p\u0303.\n5\n\n(15)\n\n\fAfter applying the same procedure \"infinitely many times\" (to a \"infinitely large state\"),\nwe obtain the state:\n|\u03c6\u221e i \u2261 lim |\u03c6n in\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 e n e n e n e n\ne n |A\u2191i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n .\n= lim \u221a |A\u2191i\n|A\u2193iR |B \u2191iL |B \u2191iR + |A\u2193i\nL\nL\nR\nL\nR\nn\u2192\u221e\n2\n\n(16)\n\nThe total probability is then:\np=\n\np\u0303\n= |\u03b1\u03b2|2.\n2\n\n(17)\n\nNow note that even if we had, instead of non-absorbing, any kind of path detectors, our\nprotocol would still work assuming we perform a path measurement on n \u2212 1 particles. We\nwould then have absorbed all these n \u2212 1 particles, and their state would be replaced by\nthe vacuum state |0i. In the n \u2192 \u221e limit this will factorize out to give the final maximally\nentangled state:\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 e n e n\ne n |A\u2191i\ne n |B \u2193i |B \u2193i .\n|\u03c6\u221e i = lim \u221a |A\u2191i\n|A\n\u2193i\n|B\n\u2191i\n|B\n\u2191i\n+\n|A\n\u2193i\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\nn\u2192\u221e\n2\n\n(18)\n\nThe probability p given by equation (17) provides us with a measure of efficiency of our\nentanglement concentration protocol. It is the amount of entanglement in e-bits that we can\nextract from a single pair of entangled particles in the initial state |\u03c6in given by equation\n(3), in the limiting case:\nE \u221e (|\u03c6in ) = p , (n \u2192 \u221e).\n\n(19)\n\nBosons \u2013 In this case, the procedure is almost the same as for fermions, but this time\nwe discard the anti-bunching results and keep the bunching ones.\nAfter Bob measures the first pair of particles, we obtain a state similar to (8), but where\nthe particles will now be either both in L1 or either both in R1. In other words, instead\nof the triplet state |B tripletiL1R1 , we have the term\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n we have\nwhile instead of |B \u2191i\nL\nR\n\nsimilarly for the last term in (8).\n\n\u221a1 (|B\n2\n\n\u2191iL1 |B \u2193iL1 + |B \u2191iR1 |B \u2193iR1 ),\n\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne n\u22121 e n\u22121\n\u221a1 (|B \u2191i\nL1 |B \u2191iL1 + |B \u2191iR1 |B \u2191iR1 )|B \u2191iL |B \u2191iR ,\n2\n\n6\n\nand\n\n\fThe probability of getting this state is again given by (11), p1 = N1\u22122 .\nBy reversing the selection of the path measurements performed by Bob (i.e. by now discarding the anti-bunching instead of the bunching results), we have established a symmetry\nbetween the bosonic and the fermionic protocols. The general state (12) and its probability\n(14) are in fact the \"same\" (isomorphic), as well as the total probability (17), p = |\u03b1\u03b2|2,\nand the efficiency (19):\nE \u221e (|\u03c6in ) = p , (n \u2192 \u221e).\n\n(20)\n\nNote that for both protocols (for fermions and for bosons) the unitary transformation\nU\u03c0 \u2261\n\nNn\n\ni=1\n\nU\u03c0i is crucial. Since states |\u03c6in and |\u03c60 in = U\u03c0 |\u03c6in \u2013 given by equations (5) and\n\n(7) respectively \u2013 are isomorphic, one might expect the results to be the same regardless of\nU\u03c0 being applied or not. This turns out to be wrong, as applying the protocol directly to\n|\u03c6in will yield the following state:\n|\u03c6\u221e i \u2261 lim |\u03c6n i\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\ne n |A\u2191i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n |B \u2193i\ne n + \u03b2 2 |A\u2193i\ne n |A\u2193i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n |B \u2191i\ne n ,\n\u03b12 |A\u2191i\n= lim q\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\nL\nR\nn\u2192\u221e\n|\u03b1|4 + |\u03b2|4\n\n(21)\n\nin general less entangled than the initial one.\n\nIn the protocols we have presented here, local operations are performed on one side only\n(Bob). Classical communication comes about only once, when we have one way communication from Bob to Alice at the end of the whole scheme. Of course, we can slightly change\nour protocols by allowing Alice to apply the same procedure on her side. This would require\ntwo way communication and would have half the time complexity of the protocol, but the\namount of entanglement distilled would be the same. Also, note that both Alice and Bob\ncould perform the operations on the n \u2212 1 particles, each one on their side, using either one\nbeam splitter sequentially or n \u2212 1 beam splitters in parallel. The latter case has a lower\ntime complexity than the former, but requires more resources (higher space complexity).\nThe efficiency |\u03b1\u03b2|2 of our protocol happens to be lower than both the efficiency 2|\u03b1|2\nof the procrustean method and the efficiency \u2212|\u03b1|2 Log|\u03b1|2 \u2212 |\u03b2|2Log|\u03b2|2 of the standard\n7\n\n\fasymptotic entanglement concentration procedure [3]. However, our target is not to propose\na more efficient alternative entanglement concentration, but to explicitly demonstrate that\nit is possible to do entanglement concentration by using only the effects of particle statistics,\nwithout resort to an explicit controlled operation between spins or between spin and path. In\nall physical implementations of entanglement concentration or purification protocols to date\n[10,11], a polarization beam splitter or a polarization dependent filter (which accomplish a\ncontrolled operation on path conditional on spin) have been used.\nIt is important to note here that our mechanism will work even if the basis states |\u2191i and\n|\u2193i, were rotated in a plane. This is because the only unitary rotation we use is U\u03c0 , which\nwill flip all spins in one plane. The rest of the protocol uses particle statistics, which is basis\nindependent. On the other hand, for standard entanglement concentration protocols [2,3],\nit is necessary to know the basis.\nIn this paper we have presented an entanglement concentration scheme which uses only\nthe effects of quantum statistics. Although the efficiency of the protocol is the same for\nboth fermions and bosons, the protocol itself is slightly different depending on the nature\nof the particles. This brings forth a fundamental difference between these two types of\nparticles in terms of their information processing power. Recent experiments such as [13,14]\nsuggest that it would be possible to test our results in the near future. It would also be\ninteresting to investigate the possibility of entanglement distillation of mixed states using\nsolely statistical effects. Future work will comprise of investigating more extensive quantum\ninformation processing procedures.\nN.P. thanks Elsag S.p.A. for financial support.\n\nY.O. acknowledges support from\n\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia from Portugal.
