With the\naccumulation of huge data in the B- system, the standard model (SM) will be subjected to a\nvery stringent test. At the same it is also considered that the experiments at B factories are\nalso potential sources for probing new physics. The BaBar [1] and Belle [2] measurements of\nthe time-dependent asymmetries in the gold plated mode B \u2192 \u03c8KS have provided the first\nevidence of CP violation in the B-system. The observed world average of sin 2\u03b2 [3],\nsin 2\u03b2\u03c8KS = 0.734 \u00b1 0.054,\n\n(1)\n\nagrees well with the SM prediction. This indicates that CP symmetry is significantly violated\nin nature and the Kobayashi-Maskawa (KM) mechanism [4] seems to be the dominant source\nof CP violation, in which the phase \u03b4KM is the only source of CP violation. However, this\nspeculation does not exclude interesting CP violating new physics (NP) effects in other\nB decays. Since the decay B \u2192 \u03c8KS (b \u2192 cc\u0304s) is a tree level process in the SM, the NP\ncontributions to its amplitude are naturally suppressed. Moreover, at loop level NP may give\nlarge contributions to the B 0 -B\u0304 0 mixing as well as to the loop-induced decay amplitudes.\nThe former effects are universal to all B 0 decay modes and are constrained to be less than\n20% compared to that of the SM contribution [3]. On the other hand, the effects of new\nphysics in the decay amplitudes are non-universal, may vary from process to process and\ncan show up in the comparison of the CP asymmetries in different decay modes [5].\nOne of the most promising processes for NP searches widely considered in literature [614] is the decay B \u2192 \u03c6KS . Various NP scenarios have been presented to explain the data.\nUnfortunately, we do not know at present which is the correct one. Hopefully, careful study\nin future will rule out some of the scenarios, at least as far as the understanding of B physics\nand CP violation is concerned.\nUnlike B \u2192 \u03c8KS , the process B \u2192 \u03c6KS has no tree level amplitude, which makes\ninroads for NP to play an important role in this mode. In the SM the decay b \u2192 ss\u0304s,\nwhich contributes to B \u2192 \u03c6KS , is induced at one loop level. Thus, it is natural to expect\nthat new physics contribution to this decay mode may be quite significant. According to\nthe KM mechanism of CP violation, both CP asymmetries in B \u2192 \u03c6KS and B \u2192 \u03c8KS\nprocesses should measure the same quantity, namely sin 2\u03b2, with negligible hadronic uncertainties (upto O(\u03bb2 ), \u03bb \u2248 0.2) [5, 12]. However, contrary to the SM expectations, the recent\nmeasurements of CP asymmetries in B \u2192 \u03c6KS by BaBar [15] and Belle [2] collaborations\nhave registered significant deviation from the predictions, as\n\nsin(2\u03b2)\u03c6KS = \u22120.19+0.52\n\u22120.50 \u00b1 0.09\nsin(2\u03b2)\u03c6KS = \u22120.73 \u00b1 0.64 \u00b1 0.18\n\nBaBar\nBelle\n\n(2)\n\nwith an average\nsin((2\u03b2)\u03c6KS )ave = \u22120.39 \u00b1 0.41\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe corresponding branching ratio is given (in units of 10\u22126 ) as\nBR(B \u2192 \u03c6K 0 ) = 8.7+1.7\n\u22121.5 \u00b1 0.9\n0\nBR(B \u2192 \u03c6K ) = 10.0+1.9+0.9\n\u22121.7\u22121.3\nBR(B \u2192 \u03c6K 0 ) = 5.4+3.7\n\u22122.7 \u00b1 0.7\n\nBaBar\nBelle\nCLEO [16]\n\n(4)\n\nwith an average\nBR(B \u2192 \u03c6K 0 )ave = 8.67 \u00b1 1.28 .\n\n(5)\n\nOne can see that there are large statistical errors associated with these measurements.\nNevertheless, the data establish a 2.7\u03c3 deviation from the SM prediction sin(2\u03b2)\u03c6KS =\nsin(2\u03b2)\u03c8KS . Therefore, if the measurement of sin 2\u03b2 in B \u2192 \u03c8KS is considered as the\nfirst evidence of large CP violation in B system then the difference between sin(2\u03b2)\u03c6KS and\nsin(2\u03b2)\u03c8KS is likely to be regarded as a potential hint for the presence of new physics. There\nare several attempts in the literature [6-14] with detail discussion on the possible implications\nof this result.\nThe second channel we are interested in is B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032KS . This is another two-body decay\nmode which is similar to the two mentioned above. Since many alternative schemes have\nbeen presented in the literature recently to explain the sin(2\u03b2)\u03c6Ks deviation, it is therefore\nvery important to verify that each of the NP scenarios should successfully explain them all.\nAt present it is difficult to say which is the correct description. In order to narrow down the\nsame it is highly desirable that one should carefully study them. This will not only help us\nto narrow down the sources of NP but also provide important clues for hadronic B-physics\nin general.\nB 0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 KS also receives dominant contribution from the b \u2192 ss\u0304s gluonic penguin, and\ntherefore it is expected that the time dependent mixing induced CP asymmetry for this\nmode will also give the value sin 2\u03b2 [3]. However, this decay mode also has a tiny CKM as\nwell as color suppressed b \u2192 u\u016bs tree contributions along with b \u2192 sq\u0304q (q = u, d) penguins,\nwhich induce deviation from the leading result. It has been shown in Ref. [17] that this\ndeviation will be below two percent level. Belle [18] and BaBar [19] collaborations have\nrecently measured the CP asymmetry for this mode which is given as\nsin(2\u03b2)\u03b7\u2032 KS = 0.71 \u00b1 0.37+0.05\n\u22120.06\nsin(2\u03b2)\u03b7\u2032 KS = 0.02 \u00b1 0.34 \u00b1 0.03\n\nBelle\nBABAR\n\n(6)\n\nwith an average\nsin((2\u03b2)\u03b7\u2032 KS )ave = 0.33 \u00b1 0.25 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhose central value also deviates significantly from SM expectations.\nIn this paper we would like to investigate the new physics effects on the CP asymmetry\nparameters of the decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c6KS and B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 KS modes, arising from some simple\nextensions of the SM. The models considered here are the two Higgs doublet models (THDM)\nwhich allows tree level flavor changing neutral currents, the so called model III and the model\nwith extra vector-like down quarks (VLDQ). We show that the observed data for B 0 \u2192 \u03c6KS\n3\n\n\fcan be easily accommodated in the VLDQ model whereas it can not be explained in the\nTHDM, and both the models can explain the data for B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 KS mode. It has already been\ndiscussed in Ref.[6], that whether these two models can explain the observed CP asymmetry\nin B \u2192 \u03c6KS mode, i.e. sin(2\u03b2)\u03c6KS . However in this paper we have explicitly done the\ncalculation for both the decay modes and confirm the result of Ref. [6] for the decay mode\nB \u2192 \u03c6KS .\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II, we present the basic formulae for CP\nviolating parameters, in the presence of new physics. In section III, we discuss CP violation\neffects in B 0 \u2192 \u03c6KS mode arising from the THDM and VLDQ model. The B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 KS\nprocess is discussed in section IV. Section V contains our conclusion.\n\n2\n\nCP violation parameters\n\nHere, we will present the basic formulae of CP asymmetry parameters, in the presence of new\nphysics. Due to the contributions from new physics, these parameters deviate substantially\nfrom their standard model values. Let us consider the B 0 and B\u0304 0 decay into a CP eigenstate\nfCP (we consider fCP = \u03c6KS or \u03b7 \u2032 KS ). Here, we are presenting the formulae for B 0 \u2192 \u03c6KS\nmode, but the same results will also hold for B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 KS mode. The time dependent CP\nasymmetry for B \u2192 \u03c6KS can be described by [20]\nA\u03c6KS (t) = C\u03c6KS cos(\u2206MBd t) + S\u03c6KS sin(\u2206MBd t)\nwhere we identify\nC\u03c6KS =\n\n1 \u2212 |\u03bb|2\n,\n1 + |\u03bb|2\n\nS\u03c6KS = \u2212\n\n2Im(\u03bb)\n,\n1 + |\u03bb|2\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nas the direct and the mixing-induced CP asymmetries. The parameter \u03bb corresponds to\n\u03bb=\n\nq A(B\u0304 \u2192 \u03c6KS )\np A(B \u2192 \u03c6KS )\n\n(10)\n\nwhere, q and p are the mixing parameters and represented by the CKM elements in the\nstandard model as\nq\nV \u2217 Vtd\n(11)\n= tb \u2217\np\nVtb Vtd\nUsing CKM unitarity, the amplitude for B\u0304 \u2192 \u03c6KS is given as [12, 21]\nA(B\u0304 \u2192 \u03c6KS ) = \u03bbc Acs + \u03bbu Aus\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03bbq = Vqb Vqs\u2217 . The first term which is the dominant one, is real. Thus if one neglects\nthe subdominant amplitude i.e. the doubly Cabibbo supressed second term which in general\nexpected to be very small, the mixing induced CP asymmetry is given as, S\u03c6KS = sin 2\u03b2,\n\n4\n\n\fsame as the one for B \u2192 \u03c8KS in the SM. It has beeen shown in Ref. [12], that the correction\ndue to the second term is upto O(\u03bb2 ) i.e.,\n|S\u03c6KS \u2212 sin 2\u03b2| \u2264 O(\u03bb2 ) .\n\n(13)\n\nAdding a mild dynamical assumption to the SU(3) analysis, recently it has been shown in\nRef. [21] that the upper bound of standard model pollution to the dominant amplitude of\nB \u2192 \u03c6KS mode is of the order of 0.25 and for B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 KS as 0.3.\n\nNew Physics could in principle contribute to both mixing and decay amplitudes. The new\nphysics contribution to mixing is universal while it is non universal and process dependent in\nthe decay amplitudes. As the NP contributions to mixing phenomena is universal, it will still\nset S\u03c8KS = S\u03c6KS . Therefore, to explain the observed 2.7\u03c3 deviation in (S\u03c8KS \u2212 S\u03c6KS ), here\nwe explore the NP effects only in the decay amplitudes. Thus including the NP contributions,\nwe can write the decay amplitude for B \u2192 \u03c6K process as\nh\n\nA(B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K) = ASM + AN P = ASM 1 + rN P ei\u03c6NP\n\ni\n\n(14)\n\nwhere rN P = |AN P /ASM |, (ASM and AN P correspond to the SM and NP contributions to\nthe B \u2192 \u03c6KS decay amplitude) and \u03c6N P = Arg(AN P /ASM ), which contains both strong\nand weak phase components.\nThe branching ratio for B \u2192 \u03c6K decay process can be given as\n\u0010\n\n2\nBR(B \u2192 \u03c6K) = BRSM 1 + rN\nP + 2rN P cos \u03c6N P\n\nwhere BRSM represents the corresponding standard model value.\n\n\u0011\n\n(15)\n\nNow if we write \u03c6N P = \u03b4N P + \u03b8N P , where \u03b4N P and \u03b8N P are the relative strong and weak\nphases between the new physics contributions to the decay amplitude and the SM part, one\ncan then obtain the expressions for the CP asymmetries as\nS\u03c6K =\n\n2\nsin 2\u03b2 + 2rN P cos \u03b4N P sin(2\u03b2 + \u03b8N P ) + rN\nP sin(2\u03b2 + 2\u03b8N P )\n2\n1 + rN P + 2rN P cos \u03b4N P cos \u03b8N P\n\n(16)\n\n\u22122rN P sin \u03b4N P sin \u03b8N P\n2\n1 + rN\nP + 2rN P cos \u03b4N P cos \u03b8N P\n\n(17)\n\nand\nC\u03c6K =\n\nIn Eqs. (16) and (17) there are three unknowns, namely, rN P , \u03b8N P and \u03b4N P . So if\nsomehow we could constrain the value of rN P considering different new physics models, we\ncould vary the \u03b8N P and \u03b4N P parameters to obtain the required value of S\u03c6K .\n\n3\n\nCP Violation in B \u2192 \u03c6KS process\n\nTo study the CP violation effects in B 0 \u2192 \u03c6KS process, first we present the SM amplitude\nand then we consider the THDM and thereafter the model with extra vector-like down quark,\nin the following subsections.\n5\n\n\f3.1\n\nSM contributions\n\nIn the SM, the decay process B \u2192 \u03c6KS proceeds through the quark level transition b \u2192 ss\u0304s,\nwhich is induced by the QCD, electroweak and magnetic penguins. QCD penguins with\nthe top quark in the loop contribute predominantly to such process. However, since we are\nlooking for NP here we would like to retain all the contributions. The effective Hamiltonian\ndescribing the decay b \u2192 ss\u0304s [22] is given as\nHef f\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n10\nX\nGF\n= \u2212 \u221a Vtb Vts\u2217 \uf8ed Cj Oj + Cg Og \uf8f8 ,\n2\nj=3\n\n(18)\n\nwhere O3 , * * * , O6 and O7 , * * * , O10 are the standard QCD and EW penguin operators, respectively, and Og is the gluonic magnetic operator. Within the SM and at scale MW , the\nWilson coefficients C1 (MW ), * * * , C10 (MW ) at next to leading logarithmic order (NLO) and\nCg (MW ) at leading logarithmic order (LO) have been given in Ref [23]. The corresponding\nQCD corrected values at the energy scale \u03bc = mb , can be obtained using the renormalization\ngroup equation, as described in Ref. [24].\nTo calculate the B meson decay rate, we use the factorization approximation to evaluate\nthe hadronic matrix element hOi i \u2261 hK\u0304 0 \u03c6|Oi |B\u0304 0 i. Since the hadronic matrix elements do\nnot appear in the expressions for CP asymmetry parameters, they will not introduce any\nuncertainties in the results. In this approximation the matrix elements are given as hO3i =\nhO4 i = 4X/3, hO5 i = X, hO6 i = X/3, hO7 i = \u2212X/2, hO8 i = \u2212X/6 and hO9i = hO10 i =\n\u22122X/3, where the factorizable hadronic matrix element X is given as X = hK\u0304 0 (pK )|s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212\n\u03b35 )b|B\u0304 0 (pB )ih\u03c6(q, \u01eb\u03c6 )|s\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )s|0i = 2F1BK (M\u03c62 )f\u03c6 M\u03c6 \u01eb\u03c6 * pK . For evaluating the matrix\nelement of the most relevant operator, i.e., Og , we use the procedure of [25], where it has been\nshown that the operator Og is related to the matrix element of the QCD and electroweak\npenguin operators as\n\u03b1s mb\n1\nhOg i = \u2212 q\nhO4i + hO6 i \u2212\n(hO3i + hO5 i)\n4\u03c0 hq 2 i\nNC\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(19)\n\nwhere q \u03bc is the momentum transferred by the gluon to the (s\u0304, s) pair. The parameter hq 2 i\nintroduces certain uncertainty into the calculation. In the literature its value is taken in\n2\n2\n2\n2\nthe range 1/4 <\n\u223c hq i/mb <\n\u223c 1/2 [26], and we will use hq i/mb = 1/2 [24], in our numerical\ncalculations.\nThus, in the factorization approach the amplitude A \u2261 h\u03c6K 0 |Hef f |B 0 i of the decay\nB \u2192 \u03c6K 0 takes a form\n0\n\nGF\n1\nA(B\u0304 \u2192 \u03c6K\u0304 ) = \u2212 \u221a Vtb Vts\u2217 a3 + a4 + a5 \u2212 (a7 + a9 + a10 ) X ,\n2\n2\n0\n\n0\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(20)\n\nwhere X stands for the factorizable hadronic matrix element of which exact form is irrelevant\nfor us since it cancels out in the CP asymmetries. The coefficients ai are given by\nef f\na2i\u22121 = C2i\u22121\n+\n\n1 ef f\nC ,\nNc 2i\n\nef f\na2i = C2i\n+\n\n6\n\n1 ef f\nC\n,\nNc 2i\u22121\n\n(21)\n\n\fwhere NC is the number of colors. The values of the QCD improved effective coefficients\nCief f can be found in [24, 27]. Now substituting the values of ai for NC =3, from [27], the\nvalue of the form factor F1BK (M\u03c62 ) = 0.39 and using the \u03c6 meson decay constant f\u03c6 = 0.233\nGeV and \u03c4B0 = 1.542 \u00d7 10\u221212 sec [28], we obtain the branching ratio in SM as\nBRSM (B \u2192 \u03c6K 0 ) = 10.5 \u00d7 10\u22126\n\n(22)\n\nwhich lies within the present experimental limits (5).\n\n3.2\n\nTwo Higgs Doublet Model contributions\n\nWe now proceed to calculate the new physics effect in two Higgs doublet Model (THDM),\nwhich is one of the simplest extensions of the SM [29]. In such models, the tree level flavor\nchanging neutral currents (FCNC's) are prevented by imposing one ad hoc discrete symmetry\nto constrain the THDM scalar potential and Yukawa Lagrangian and thus one obtains the\nso called model I and model II [30]. In model I both the up and down type quarks get mass\nfrom the Yukawa couplings to the same Higgs doublet \u03c61 and in Model II the up- and down\ntype quarks get their masses from Yukawa couplings to two different scalar doublets \u03c61 and\n\u03c62 . Here we consider the model III [31] of THDM where no discrete symmetry is imposed\nand both up- and down type quarks may have diagonal and/or off diagonal flavor changing\ncouplings with the two Higgs doublets \u03c61 and \u03c62 .\nThe Yukawa Lagrangian of the quarks in model III is given in the form [27]\nU\nD\n\u02c6U\n\u02c6D\nLIII\nY = \u03b7ij Q\u0304i,L \u03c6\u03031 Uj,R + \u03b7ij Q\u0304i,L \u03c61 Dj,R + \u03beij Q\u0304i,L \u03c6\u03032 Uj,R + \u03beij Q\u0304i,L \u03c62 Dj,R + h.c\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03c6i (i = 1, 2) are the two Higgs doublets of THDM, \u03c6\u0303i = i\u03c42 \u03c6\u2217i , Qi,L with (i = 1, 2, 3)\nare the left handed isodoublet quarks Uj,R (Dj,R) are the right handed isosinglet up (down)\nU,D\ntype quarks. \u03b7i,j\ncorrespond to the diagonal mass matrices of the up and down quarks,\nwhile the neutral and charged flavor changing couplings are\n\u221a\nmi mj\nU,D\nU,D\nU\nU\n\u03beij =\n\u03bbij , \u03be\u02c6neutral\n= \u03be U,D , \u03be\u02c6charged\n= \u03be U VCKM , \u03be\u02c6neutral\n= VCKM \u03be D ,\n(24)\nv\nwhere VCKM is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix [4]. The coupling constants\n\u03bbij are the free parameters of the model to be determined from experimental data.\nRecently Chao et al [32] studied the b \u2192 s\u03b3 process and Xiao et al [27] studied the\ncharmless nonleptonic decays of B mesons using the model III of THDM where they have\nkept only the couplings \u03bbtt = |\u03bbtt |ei\u03b8t and \u03bbbb = |\u03bbbb |ei\u03b8b as nonzero. From the studies of\n[27, 32], it is known that, the following parameter space for model III\n\u03bbij = 0 for ij 6= tt or bb\n|\u03bbtt | = 0.3, |\u03bbbb | = 35, \u03b8 = (0\u25e6 \u2212 30\u25e6 ), MH + = (200 \u00b1 100) GeV\n7\n\n(25)\n\n\fwhere \u03b8 = \u03b8b \u2212 \u03b8t , are allowed by the available data. The advantage of keeping only these\ntwo couplings nonzero is that the neutral Higgs boson do not contribute at the tree level or\none loop level. The new contributions therefore come only from the charged Higgs penguin\nloop with heavy internal top quark.\nThe new physics will manifest itself by modifying the corresponding Inami-Lim [33] functions C0 (x), D0 (x), E0 (x) and E0\u2032 (x) which determine the Wilson coefficients C3 (MW ), * * * , C10 (MW )\nand Cg (MW ) in SM. The new strong and electroweak penguin diagrams in THDM can be\nobtained from the corresponding penguin diagrams in SM by replacing the internal W \u00b1 lines\nby the charged Higgs H \u00b1 lines. Following the same procedure as in the SM, it is straight\nforward to calculate the new \u03b3-, Z 0 and gluonic penguin diagrams induced by the exchange\n\u00b1\nof charged Higgs bosons in Model III. These new Wilson coefficients CiH (MW ) i = 3, * * * , 10\nat NLO level and Cg at the LO level can now be written as\n\n\u00b1\n\n\u03b1s (MW ) N P \u03b1em\n1\nC0N P\nE0 +\n2\n24\u03c0\n6\u03c0 sin \u03b8W\n\u03b1s (MW ) N P\nE0\n8\u03c0\n\u03b1s (MW ) N P\nE0\n\u2212\n24\u03c0\n\u03b1s (MW ) N P\nE0\n8\u03c0h\ni\n\u03b1em\n4C0N P + D0N P\n6\u03c0\nH\u00b1\nC10\n(MW ) = 0\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u03b1em\nNP\nNP\nNP\n4C0 + D0 +\n4C\n6\u03c0\nsin2 \u03b8W 0\n1 \u2032\n\u2212 E0N P\n2\n\nC3H (MW ) = \u2212\n\u00b1\n\nC4H (MW ) =\n\u00b1\n\nC5H (MW ) =\n\u00b1\n\nC6H (MW ) =\n\u00b1\n\nC7H (MW ) =\n\u00b1\n\nC8H (MW ) =\n\u00b1\n\nC9H (MW ) =\n\u00b1\n\nCgH (MW ) =\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the functions C0N P , D0N P , E0N P and E0\u2032N P are the new physics contributions to the\nWilson coefficients arising from the charged Higgs exchange penguin diagrams.

Including\nthe new physics contributions the values of the effective Wilson coefficients at the scale O(mb )\nare explicitly given in Ref. [27].

(16), we find that the value of S\u03c6K can not be negative as\nshown in Fig-1. Thus the observed value of S\u03c6K can not be accommodated in the THDM.\n\n3.3\n\nContributions from Model with extra vector like down quark\n\nNow we consider the model with an additional vector like down quark [34]. It is a simple\nmodel beyond the SM with an enlarged matter sector with an additional vector-like down\nquark D4 . The most interesting effects in this model concern CP asymmetries in neutral B\ndecays into final CP eigenstates. At a more phenomenological level, models with isosinglet\nquarks provide the simplest self consistent framework to study deviations of 3 \u00d7 3 unitarity\nof the CKM matrix as well as, allow flavor changing neutral currents at the tree level. The\npresence of an additional down quark implies a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix Vi\u03b1 (i = u, c, t, 4, \u03b1 = d, s, b, b\u2032 ),\ndiagonalizing the down quark mass matrix. For our purpose, the relevant information for\nthe low energy physics is encoded in the extended mixing matrix. The charged currents are\nunchanged except the VCKM is now the 3 \u00d7 4 upper submatix of V . However, the distinctive\nfeature of this model is that FCNC enters neutral current Lagrangian of the left handed\ndownquarks :\nLZ =\n\nh\ni\ng\n\u03bc\n\u016bLi \u03b3 \u03bc uLi \u2212 d \u0304L\u03b1 U\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03bc dL\u03b2 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b8W Jem\nZ\u03bc\n2 cos \u03b8W\n\n9\n\n(30)\n\n\f1\n360\n\nS\u03a6K\n0.5\n\n270\n0\n-180\n\n180\u2206\nNP\n\n-90\n90\n\n0\n\u0398NP\n\n90\n1800\n\nFigure 1: 3DPlot of S\u03c6K versus the weak phase \u03b8N P and strong phase \u03b4N P (in degrees) for\nrN P = 0.28\nwith\nU\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nX\n\ni=u,c,t\n\n\u2217\nV\u03b1i\u2020 Vi\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 V4\u03b1\nV4\u03b2\n\n(31)\n\nwhere U is the neutral current mixing matrix for the down sector which is given above.

[27]\nwe obtain the branching ratio in the standard model as\nBR(B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K 0 )|SM = 3.24 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\n(47)\n\nwhich is slightly less than the current experimental data [28]\n\u22125\nBR(B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K 0 ) = (5.8+1.4\n.\n\u22121.3 ) \u00d7 10\n\n(48)\n\nNow we consider the contributions arising from THDM.

According to the SM\nexpectation they should measure the same. Unlike the B \u2192 \u03c8KS , which is a tree level\nprocess, B \u2192 \u03c6KS occurs at one loop level, which allows room for new physics to play an\nimportant role. In this paper, we have explored two simple beyond SM scenarios, the two\nHiggs doublet model (model III) and model with extra vector like down quark. We found\nthat model III of THDM is unable to explain, whereas vector like down quark model can\neasily explain the result.\n\n17\n\n\f8\n\nBR\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150 200 250 300 350\n\u03a6NP\n\nFigure 7: Branching ratio of B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K 0 process (in units of 10\u22125 ) in VLDQ model versus the\nphase \u03c6N P (in degree). The horizontal solid line is the central experimental value whereas\nthe dashed horizontal lines denote the error limits.\nIt is important to note here that any new physics scenario that explains the \u03c6Ks discrepancy must also explain another similar two-body decay B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 Ks , which is also expected to\ngive the same value as of \u03c8Ks or \u03c6Ks , i.e., sin 2\u03b2. In doing so it will be easy to rule out or\nnarrow down the various NP scenarios. We found that both the models (THDM-model-III\nand VLDQ) can explain the \u03b7 \u2032 Ks result. This in turn gives us the clue that the VLDQ\nmodel may possibly be a strong contender for the NP effects responsible in B \u2192 \u03c6Ks . It\nis worthwhile to emphasize that various supersymmetric models (as can be found in the\nliterature) can explain the \u03c6Ks discrepancy. But apart from [13, 14] none of the scenarios\nso far explained the simultaneous explanation of \u03c6Ks and \u03b7 \u2032 Ks . On the other hand, our\nfindings indicate that the simple non-supersymmetric extension of the SM in terms of the\nmatter content should not be ignored for possible NP candidature. Regardless of the sources\nof NP, if in future the \u03c6Ks result continues to be different from the SM expectation, then it\nwill certainly establish the presence of NP.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Yuval Grossman for fruitful discussions.
