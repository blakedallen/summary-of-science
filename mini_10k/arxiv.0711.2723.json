The wide range of biochemical functions performed by the proteins are specified\nby their detailed structures. Despite the large degrees\nof freedom, surprisingly, proteins fold into their native\nstates in a very short time, which is known as Levinthal's\nParadox [1]. Although, given suitable conditions, some\nsmall proteins can reach their native state in a single concerted step, many others fold in stages with initial conformational events long before the final ('native') structure\nappears [2]. Structural changes and chemical interactions occur throughout the entire folding process, and\nstrongly cooperative mechanisms are necessary to bring\nthe protein in its native conformation within a very short\ntime period [3]. The fast folding is a result of the catalytic effect of the formation of clusters of residues in contact with each other, which have high preferences for the\nearly formation of secondary structures (helices, sheets,\nand loops) in the presence of significant amounts of longrange tertiary structure interactions [4].\nThe folding mechanism, kinetics, structure and function of proteins are intimately related to each other.\nMisfolding of proteins into non-native structures can\nlead to several disorders [5]. Correlating sequence with\nstructure, as well as understanding of folding kinetics has been an area of intense activity for experimentalists and theoreticians [6, 7]. Among the different\n\n\u2020 Corresponding Author\n\u2217 Electronic address: ganesh.bagler@gmail.com\n\u2021 Electronic\n\naddress: sinha@ccmb.res.in\n\ntheoretical approaches used for studying protein structure, function, and folding kinetics, the graph theoretical approach, based on perspectives from complex networks, has been used recently to study protein structures [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nIt is known that folding mechanisms are largely determined by a protein's topology rather than its interatomic interactions [18]. With that understanding, we\nbuild graph-theoretical models of protein structures to\ninvestigate various topological properties at two different length scales, and study their possible role in the\nkinetics of the protein folding. We use a coarse-grained\ncomplex network model of a protein structure, viz. the\nProtein Contact Network (PCN), by ignoring the finegrained atomic-level details, and model the three dimensional structure as a system constituted of amino acid\nunits, put in place by noncovalent interactions. Longrange interactions are known to play a distinct role in\ndetermining the tertiary structure of the proteins [19],\nas opposed to the short-range interactions, which could\nlargely contribute to the secondary structure formations.\nWe consider the Long-range Interaction Network (LIN)\nof each protein, which are subsets of the corresponding\nPCNs, constructed by ignoring the short-range interactions. The idea behind studying LINs is to understand\nthe contribution of the long-range interactions to the\ntopological properties, and their correlation to a biophysically relevant property, viz. rate of protein folding.\nThis study aims to address the question-Can general\nnetwork parameters, derived from native-state structures\nof proteins, uncover features about the relationship of\nthe structural properties to the folding kinetics of the\nproteins? To study this we choose single domain, twostate folding proteins that belong to different structural\nclasses [20] for which the kinetic parameter of rate of folding, (kF ) is available. Our analysis of the coarse-grained\n\n\f2\nnetwork representations of protein structures uncover the\nexceptional topological property of a high degree of assortative mixing at both length scales (PCN and LIN) in\nthese naturally-occurring, evolutionarily selected, biological networks. Assortative mixing in LINs indicates that\nthis feature in PCNs is independent of short-range interactions. The coefficient of assortativity [21], a measure\nof assortative mixing, are also found to be considerably\nhigh for both PCNs and LINs. By constructing appropriate control networks, we further demonstrate that the\ndegree (connectivity) distribution of the PCNs alone can\npartially account for the presence of assortativity in these\nnetworks.\nTo enumerate the contribution of these global parameters obtained from the coarse-grained network model\nof protein structures to their biophysical properties, we\nshow that the coefficient of assortativity of PCNs and\nLINs tend to have positive correlation with the experimentally determined rate of folding of these proteins.\nThis implies that assortative mixing, that tends to connect highly-connected residues to other residues with\nmany contacts, may assist in speeding up of the folding\nprocess. In contrast, the average clustering coefficients\nof LINs show a good negative correlation with the rate\nof folding, indicating that clustering of amino acids, that\nparticipate in long-range interactions, into cliques, slows\ndown the folding process. Interestingly, the average clustering coefficients of PCNs show negligible correlation,\nthereby implying that the short range interactions can\nreduce the negative effect on their folding kinetics.\nThree parameters- CO (Contact Order) [22], LRO\n(Long Range Order) [23], and TCD (Total Contact Distance) [24] -based on sequence distance per contact\nand/or total number of contacts per residue of the proteins, have also been shown to have negative correlation to their rate of folding [22, 23, 24]. The accuracy of prediction of the rate of folding, with parameters\nLRO and T CD, remain unchanged if short-range interactions are not included in the calculation. Here, along\nwith delineating the role of long-range interactions, we\nhave attempted to show that general network parameters, such as, clustering coefficient and assortativity, that\nare widely-used in networks of diverse origins (technological, biological and social), can not only give an insight\ninto their structural properties, but can also be used as\nindicators of specific biophysical processes, such as, of\nprotein folding.\n\nII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nConstruction of PCN, LIN, and their Random\nControls\n\nThe Protein Contact Network (PCN) was modeled\nfrom the native-state protein structures as available in\nPDB [25]. The C\u03b1 atom of each amino acid was considered a 'node', and any two amino acids were said to\n\nbe in spatial contact ('link') if there existed a threshold\ndistance (Rc \u2264 8\u00c5) between their C\u03b1 atoms.\nThe Long-range Interaction Network (LIN) of a PCN\nwas obtained by considering, other than the backbone\nlinks, only those 'contacts' which occur between amino\nacids that are 'distant' (i.e. separated by 12 or more\namino acids) from each other along the backbone. Thus\nformed, a LIN is a subset of its PCN with same number\nof nodes (nr ) but fewer number of links due to removal\nof the short-range contacts.\nTwo types of random controls were created for the\nPCNs of the proteins. The polypeptide backbone connectivity was kept intact in both the random controls, while\nrandomizing the noncovalent contacts. For every protein,\n100 instances of each type of random control were generated from its PCN. Average of all the instances were used\nas a representative of the parameters and properties, and\ncompared with that of the PCNs and their LINs.\nType I : This random control network has the same\nnumber of residues (nr ) and number of links/contacts\n(nc ) as those of the PCN, except that the contacts were\ncreated randomly by avoiding duplicate and self contacts.\nType II : Apart from maintaining the number of nodes\n(nr ) and contacts (nc ), the connectivity distribution\nof PCNs was also conserved in this control network.\nTo ensure adequate randomization, the pattern of pairconnectivity was randomized 2000 times.\nThe details of methods of construction with illustration\nis given in Supplementary Data.\n\nData\n\nExcept for Fig. 1, all studies have been done on\n30 single-domain, two-state folding, globular proteins,\nwhose experimental rate of folding (ln(kF )) are available.\nThe data include 5 all-\u03b1, 13 all-\u03b2, and 12 \u03b1\u03b2 class of proteins. The natural logarithms of rate of folding (ln(kF ))\nof these proteins vary between \u22121.48 and 9.8 and have a\nrange for the time of folding (1/kF ) of the order of 105\nseconds. Sizes (nr ) of these proteins range from 43 to\n126 amino acids. The structural data for these studies\nwere obtained from the Protein Data Bank [25]. The\npreliminary network analysis (shown in Fig. 1) was done\non 110 proteins (43 < nr < 2359) from the major structural classes, which include the 30 single domain proteins\nmentioned above.\n\nNetwork parameters\n\nThe following parameters were studied for the PCN,\nLIN, and their random controls.\nShortest Path Length and Characteristic Path\nLength-Shortest path length (Lij ) between any pair of\nnodes i & j is the number of links that must be traversed\nbetween them by the shortest route. The average\nof all shortest path lengths, known as 'characteristic\n\n\f3\n\nwhere nr is the number of residues in the network.\nClustering Coefficient -Clustering coefficient is the\nmeasure of cliquishness of the network. Clustering coefficient of a node i, Ci , is defined [26] as the Ci = 2 \u2217\nn/ki (ki \u2212 1), where n denotes the number of contacts\namongst the ki neighbors of node i. Average clustering\ncoefficient of the network (C) is the average of Ci s of all\nthe nodes in the network and is referred to as 'clustering\ncoefficient' unless specified otherwise.\nDegree and Remaining Degree-Degree (k) is defined\nas the total number of neighbors a node is connected to.\nDegree is one of the measures of 'centrality' of a node in\nthe network-the larger the degree more important it is.\nRemaining degree is one less than the total degree of a\nnode [21]. Other measures, based on degree, are maximum degree, kmax , average degree, hki, and the average\ndegree of nearest neighbors, hknn (k)i.\nAssortative Mixing and Coefficient of Assortativity-\nA network is said to show assortative mixing, if the highdegree nodes in the network tend to be connected with\nother high-degree nodes, and 'disassortative' when the\nhigh-degree nodes tend to connect to low-degree nodes.\nThe Coefficient of Assortativity (r) measures the tendency of degree correlation. It is the Pearson correlation\ncoefficient of the degrees at either end of a link and is\ndefined [21] as,\n1 X\nr= 2\njk(ejk \u2212 qj qk ),\n\u03c3q\njk\n\nwhere r is the coefficient of assortativity, j and k are\nthe degrees of nodes, qj and qk are the remaining degree\ndistributions, ejk is the joint distribution of the remaining degrees of the two nodes at either end of a randomly\nchosen link, and \u03c3q is the variance of the distribution qk .\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\n30\n\nCharacteristic Path Length (L)\n\npath length' (L), is an indicator of compactness of the\nnetwork, and is defined as [26],\nPnr \u22121 Pnr\n2\ni=1\nj=i+1 Lij\n,\nL=\nnr (nr \u2212 1)\n\nPCNs\nLINs\n(Type I) Random Controls of PCNs\nLINs of (Type I) Random Controls\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nClustering Coefficient (C)\n\nFIG. 1: L-C plot for 110 proteins from different structural\nclasses: PCNs (\u0003), LINs (3), Type I Random Controls of\nPCNs ( ) and LINs(N). Error-bars in the random controls\ndata indicate standard deviations in L and C for each protein\ncomputed over 100 instances.\n\nThe results indicate two major differences between the\ntopological properties of the PCNs and their corresponding LINs. The PCNs of these proteins have high clustering coefficients (CP CN = 0.562\u00b10.029) compared to their\nrandom controls, whereas the LINs show distribution in\nC over a range (CLIN = 0.259 \u00b1 0.109), even though\ntheir random controls were almost indistinguishable from\nthose of PCNs. L and C of random controls of PCNs\nwere 2.621 \u00b1 0.411 & 0.0557 \u00b1 0.0476 and that of their\nLINs were 3.256 \u00b1 0.056 & 0.075 \u00b1 0.012. The LINs also\nhave a little higher characteristic path lengths (LLIN =\n8.72 \u00b1 4.564) than PCNs (LP CN = 5.818 \u00b1 2.826) owing to their reduced number of contacts as compared to\nthose in PCNs. This indicates that the differences in\nCLIN s may assign specificity to the protein networks at\nthis length scale, which is otherwise lost with the short\nrange contacts in PCNs, rendering the generic property\nof high clustering and compactness. The role, if any, the\ndifferential extent of clustering in the protein contact networks at the two length scales may play in their kinetics\nof folding process is shown later.\n\nClustering coefficients of PCNs and LINs\n\nPCNs from a large set of proteins have earlier been\nshown [9, 10, 11, 12] to have high degree of clustering,\nwhich contributes to their \"small-world\" [26] nature. To\nstudy if the PCNs and their corresponding LINs of proteins have similar topological properties such as, characteristic path length (L) and clustering coefficient (C),\nwe plotted the L versus C graph in Fig. 1 for 110 proteins from the four major structural classes (i.e., \u03b1, \u03b2,\n\u03b1 + \u03b2, and \u03b1/\u03b2).

In LINs, most nodes were populated in the\nlow-degree region and very few of them have high de-\n\ngrees.

The nodes of degree 1 in LINs'\ndegree distributions, are the N- and C-terminal amino\nacids that are at the either end of the protein backbone. As expected [27], the Type I random controls of\nthe PCNs (Fig. 2(a), inset) have a Poisson degree distribution. LINs of Type I random controls (Fig. 2(b),\ninset) too have a Poisson degree distribution. The figure\nclearly shows that these properties are the same for proteins irrespective of their functions and structural classifications [10, 12].\n\n\f5\n\nFrequency\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n15\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nFrequency\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n15\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\nr (Coefficient of Assortativity)\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nr (Coefficient of Assortativity)\n\nFIG. 4: Histograms of 'Coefficient of Assortativity (r)' of PCNs, Type I and Type II Random Controls of PCNs, and their\nLINs.

Average Degree of the nearest neighbors,\nknn (k), of nodes of degree k, is a parameter by which one\ncan measure and visualize the degree correlation pattern\non a network. In the presence of correlations, knn (k)\nincreases with increasing k for an 'assortative network',\nand decreases with k for a 'disassortative network' [28].\nFig. 3 shows hknn (k)i versus k plots for the PCNs (a)\nand LINs (b) and the two types of random controls. The\nnature of the curves for the PCNs (\u0003 in Fig. 3(a)) and\ntheir LINs (3 in Fig. 3(b)) shows that both networks are\ncharacterized with 'assortative mixing', as the average\ndegree of the neighboring nodes increased with k. The\ncurve shows a tendency to saturate at larger k - a feature that may be due to the steric hindrance experienced\nby the connecting amino acids in the three-dimensional\nstructural organization of the protein. This steric hindrance restricts the position of an amino acid in the three\ndimensional conformational space, and results in a maximum values of degree (kmax ) of a node. In comparison,\nthe hknn (k)i remained almost constant for the Type I\nrandom control for both PCNs ( ) and LINs (N), indicating lack of correlations among the nodes' connectivity\n\nin these controls.\nThe 'coefficient of assortativity' [21], r, is a global\nquantitative measure of degree correlations in a network,\nand takes values as \u22121 \u2264 r \u2264 1. r is zero for no correlations among nodes' connectivity, and takes positive or\nnegative values for assortative or disassortative mixing,\nrespectively. The r for both PCNs and LINs of the 30\nproteins were found to be positive, indicating that the\nnetworks are assortative. Fig. 4 shows the histograms of\nr of (a) PCNs, (b) LINs, both in (\u0004), and their Type\nI random controls (\u0003). The r values of both PCNs as\nwell as LINs of all the proteins show significantly high\npositive values (range: 0.09 < r < 0.52 for PCNs, and\n0.12 < r < 0.58 for LINs) when compared to other networks of diverse origins [21]. Thus, the networks modelling the native protein structures are clearly characterized by high degree of assortative mixing at both short\nand long contact scales. The Type I random controls in\nFig. 4 (a & b), for both PCNs and their LINs, are distributed around zero, confirming the observation of lack\nof degree correlations of the controls, made in Fig. 3.\nThese properties of positive r and assortative degree\ncorrelations were also observed (data not shown) for a\nlarge number of protein structures performing various\ncellular functions and belonging to diverse structural categories (used in [12]). This conclusively proves that the\nassortative mixing in PCNs and LINs is a generic feature\nof protein structures. The role, if any, the assortative na-\n\n\f6\nture of the protein contact networks at both length scales\nmay play in their kinetics of folding process is shown\nlater.\n\nLINs of \u03b1 proteins\nLINs \u03b1\u03b2 proteins\nLINs of \u03b2 proteins\nType I Random Controls\nType II Random Controls\n\n14\n12\n10\n\nF\n\n8\n\nln k\n\nDegree distribution partially accounts for\nassortativity\n\n6\n4\n\nTo investigate whether the patterns of connectivity in\nthe PCNs and LINs of the three dimensional structures of\nthe proteins contribute towards the observed assortativity, we studied the assortative mixing and the 'coefficient\nof assortativity' of Type II random controls, in which\nthe degree distribution of the PCNs were preserved while\nrandomizing the pair-connectivities. Fig. 3(c,d) show the\ndegree correlation plots of the Type II Random Controls\nof PCN (#) and their LINs (\u25b3). It is clear that, unlike Type I random controls, the average degree of the\nneighboring nodes increased with k in Type II Random\nControls, as seen for the PCNs and LINs.\nThe histograms of the 'coefficient of assortativity' (r)\nof Type II Random Controls (\u0003) are shown in Figs. 4\n(c & d). Here also, it can be seen that the assortativity is partially recovered in the Type II random controls\nfor both PCNs and their LINs. Thus degree distribution\npartially explains the observed assortative mixing. It implies that preserving the degree distribution of PCN, even\nwhile randomizing the pair-connectivities, is important\nto partially restore the assortative mixing in the random\ncontrols of PCNs as well as their LINs. The recovery of\nassortative mixing in the LINs by Type II random controls of PCNs is even more surprising, as the degree distribution of LINs (Fig. 2(b)) is very different compared\nto the PCNs (Fig. 2(a)). This is especially significant in\nthe light of the observation [29] that one can rewire the\nlinks in a (scale-free) network to obtain assortativity or\ndisassortativity, to any degree, without any change in the\ndegree distribution.\n\nCorrelation of protein network parameters to\nprotein folding rates\n\nThe general network parameters (e.g., L, C, and r)\nhave been used to shed light on the topology, growth\nand dynamics of widely different networks - physical, social and biological. Here we show the relationship of these\ngeneral topological parameters (specifically, C and r) obtained from our coarse-grained model of protein structures (the PCNs and LINs), to a biophysical property underlying the organization of the three-dimensional structure of the protein chains, i.e., with the kinetics of protein\nfolding. Below we have correlated the available experimental data on the rate of folding of the 30 proteins with\nthe two network parameters, C and r of the PCNs and\ntheir LINs.\n\n2\n0\n\u22122\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nC*k\n\nmax\n\nFIG. 5: Rate of folding, ln(kF ), has a negative correlation,\nas indicated by the trendline, with Clustering Coefficient (C)\nLINs.\n\nAverage Clustering Coefficient and Rate of Folding\n\nFig. 1 shows that the PCNs and their LINs differ in\ntheir clustering coefficients (C), with PCNs having similar but high C, and their LINs having C distributed over\na range from low to medium values. We did not find\nany significant relationship between the clustering coefficient of the PCNs (CP CN ) and the ln(kF ) for all the 30\nproteins (correlation coefficient = -0.2437; p < 0.2). On\nthe other hand, ln(kF ) showed a high negative correlation with the average clustering coefficient of the corresponding LINs (CLIN ). Since the clustering coefficient\ndepends on the degree of the node, we plot, in Figure 5,\nthe CLIN \u2217 kmax with ln(kF ) of all the proteins. The plot\nshows significantly high negative correlation (correlation\ncoefficient = \u22120.7712; p < 0.0001) between the CLIN s\nand the rate of folding for these single-domain, two-state\nfolding proteins. Fig 5 also shows that neither Type I\nnor Type II Random Controls show any correlation with\nthe rate of folding of the corresponding LINs.\nCLIN enumerates number of loops of length three in\nthe Long-range Interaction Network. Thus CLIN essentially correlates to the number of 'distant' amino acids\n(nodes), those separated by a minimum of 12 or more\nother amino acids along the backbone, brought in mutual 'contact' with each other in the native state structure of the protein. Understandably, more the number\nof such long-range mutual contacts are required to be\nmade in order to achieve the native state, more is the\ntime taken to fold, and hence slower is the rate of folding. Interestingly, our result shows that this feature is\ncompletely neutralised through the short-range contacts\nin the PCNs. It may be mentioned that a comparable\ncorrelation (\u22120.7574; p < 0.0001) is observed between\nthe Contact Order (CO) of these 30 proteins with their\nln(kF ).

The\ntrendline is also shown.\n\nquantities that CO and CLIN measure, the similar correlation coefficients essentially indicate the important role\nof long-range contact formation in the rate of folding.\n\nCoefficient of Assortativity and Rate of Folding\n\nUnlike the clustering coefficients, the protein networks\nshow high coefficient of assortativity (r) at both length\nscales (i.e., for the PCNs and their LINs). In Fig. 6, the\nrate of folding of the proteins are plotted as a function\nof the coefficient of assortativity of their LINs. There is\nan increasing trend of ln(kF ) with increase in r. The five\n\u03b1 proteins, all having high rate of folding, do not follow\nthe trend very well. The correlation coeff. between the\nrate of folding (ln(kF )) and r of their LINs, excluding\nthe five \u03b1 proteins, is 0.6981 (p < 0.0005). The same\nfor the PCNs is calculated to be 0.5943 (p < 0.005).\nThe result implies that, along with showing assortative\nmixing, the PCNs and their LINs both show significant\npositive correlations with the rate of folding. Thus, the\ngeneric property of assortative mixing in proteins tends\nto contribute positively towards their kinetics of folding,\nand is fairly independent of the short- and long-range of\ninteractions. Here also the Type I Random Controls, due\nto their coefficient of assortativity being clustered around\nzero (Fig. 4(b)), do not show any correlation with the rate\nof folding. As is expected from Fig. 3 and 4 , the Type II\nrandom controls, on the other hand, are scattered owing\nto the partial gain in assortativity, though they do not\nshow any definite trend with the rate of folding.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn recent years, much interest is seen in the study of\nstructure and dynamics of networks, with application to\nsystems of diverse origins such as, society, technology,\nand biology etc [30, 31]. The aim of these studies has\nbeen to identify the common organizational principles\nwithin these wide variety of systems, and identify general network parameters that can correlate to the structure, function, and evolution of each of the specific processes. Of these, biological networks are of special interest as they are products of long evolutionary history. The\nprotein contact network is exclusive among other intracellular networks for their unique method of synthesis\nas a linear chain of amino acids, and then folding into\na stable three-dimensional structure through short- and\nlong-range contacts among the residues. In this study,\nour aim is to understand if the general network parameters can offer any clue to the biophysical properties of the\nexisting three dimensional structure of a protein, thereby\nreflecting the commonalities in network organization in\ngeneral.\nOur coarse-grained complex network model of protein structures uncovers, for the first time in a naturally\nevolved biological system, the interesting, and exceptional topological feature of assortativity at both short\nand long length scale of contacts. The assortative nature is found to be a generic feature of protein structures. We show that the assortativity positively correlates to the folding mechanisms at both length scale.\nThis feature corroborates the known fact that the folding mechanisms are largely independent of the finer details of the protein structure [18]. Since strongly cooperative mechanisms are necessary to bring the protein\nin its native conformation within a very short time [3],\nwe have shown that assortative mixing contributes positively towards speeding up the folding process at different\ncontact-length scales. The generality of assortative mixing in PCNs assume greater importance in the light of\nthe debate on whether protein folding kinetics is under\nevolutionary control [32, 33, 34]. Given the genetic basis\nand mode of formation of protein chains, the signature\nof assortativity as an indicator to the rate of folding is\nclear.\nWe also delineate the difference in the property of clustering of the nodes in the native structure at short and\nlong length scales. The PCNs have high degree of clustering, which contributes to their 'small-world' nature helping in efficient and effective dissipation of energy needed\nin their function [11, 12]. Our results show that, in contrast, the corresponding LINs have significantly lower\nand distributed clustering coefficients (Fig. 1), and they\nshow a negative correlation with the rate of folding of the\nproteins (Fig. 5). This indicates that clustering of amino\nacids that participate in the long-range interactions, into\n'cliques' can slow down the folding process - possibly due\nto the backbone connectivity and steric factors. However, the clustering coefficient of PCNs do not have any\n\n\f8\nsignificant correlation to the rate of folding, clearly indicating that the short-range interactions may be playing\na constructive and active role in the determination of\nthe rate of the folding process by reducing the negative\ncontribution of the LINs. Our results thus show that\nthe separation of the types of contacts in the PCNs and\nLINs clearly delineate the length scale of contacts that\nplay crucial role in protein folding. It was recently shown\nthat the CO of the Transition State Ensemble (T SE) is\nhighly correlated to that of their native state structure,\nand they both correlate equally well with their rate of\nfolding [35]. This has been attributed to the fact that the\nlong-range contacts are mainly located in the structural\ncore that are formed early in the folding process, and the\nformation of such contact networks leads to the inverse\ncorrelation with the folding rates. Our results with general parameters of the long-range interaction networks\n(CLIN and rLIN ) corresponding to the native PCNs also\nreflect the crucial role that long-range interactions play\nin their rate of folding.\nAfter the synthesis in the cell, folding of the amino\nacid chain is important for attaining the structure required to reach a functional state as soon as possible.\nThis happens through inter-residue non-covalent interactions at many length and time scales. The folded structure have to confer stability, regions for binding of ligands\nof specific shapes and sizes, transmit the information of\nbinding/unbinding to other parts of the protein, scaffold for retaining the functional regions along with the\nshape suitable for the protein function. It is likely that\nmany of these properties may require opposing features\nto operate at different time and space scales. For example, the 'small-world' nature (high clustering) in the native protein structure is useful in inter-residue signalling\nrequired for its function on binding and allostery. On\nthe other hand, the long-range interaction network have\nreduced clustering, which may facilitate communication\namong distant residues in the native structure to some\nextent, but such a feature can also increase the folding\ntime as it requires distant residues in the chain to come\ncloser during the folding process. Thus, the evolved native structure of the proteins show differential levels of\nclustering at two length scales. The assortative mixing,\non the other hand, helps in enhancing the folding process\nat both length scales.\nA large number of networks of diverse origin have been\nfound [21] to be of disassortative nature, and questions\nregarding the origin of this property and whether this\n\nis an universal property of complex networks, has been\nadjudged as \"one of the ten leading questions for network research\" [36]. Our discovery of assortativity in the\namino acid networks in protein structures at short and\nlong contact scales questions the invoked generality of\nthe property in natural networks. The assortative nature\nof the social networks has been claimed to be originating from their unusually high clustering coefficients and\ncommunity structure [37]. In proteins, LINs have high\nassortativity without necessarily having high clustering\ncoefficients. It would be interesting to study if the secondary structures provide any role in shaping the \"community structure\" in these molecular networks that help\nin conferring assortative mixing at both contact length\nscales [37, 38].\nDisassortative mixing observed in certain biological\nnetworks (metabolic signaling pathways network, and\ngene regulatory network) is conjectured to be responsible for decreasing the likelihood of crosstalk between\ndifferent functional modules of the cell, and increasing\nthe overall robustness of a network by localizing effects\nof deleterious perturbations [39]. In contrast to these two\nnetworks, PCNs are not disassortative. For the PCN, one\nmay put forward the possibility of the backbone chain\nconnectivity as a means of conferring greater robustness\nagainst perturbations.\nFrom computational studies, it has been observed [21,\n29] that assortative networks percolate easily, i.e., information gets easily transferred through the network as\ncompared to that in disassortative networks. Protein\nfolding is a cooperative phenomenon, and hence, communication amongst nodes is essential, so that appropriate noncovalent interactions can take place to form the\nstable native state structure [3]. Thus percolation of information is very much essential and could lead to the\nobserved cooperativity and fast folding of the proteins.\nHence assortative mixing observed in proteins could be\nan essential prerequisite for facilitating folding of proteins.\n\n[1] C.
