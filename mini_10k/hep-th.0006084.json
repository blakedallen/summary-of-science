INTRODUCTION\n\nThe simplest quantum mechanical system with conformal symmetry is described by the\nHamiltonian\nH=\n\np2\ng\n+ 2\n2\n2x\n\n(1)\n\nIt is easy to see that this Hamiltonian possesses a continuous spectrum down to zero energy\nand there is no well-defined ground state. A solution to this problem was suggested by de\nAlfaro, Fubini and Furlan (DFF) a long time ago [1]. They proposed the redefinition of the\nHamiltonian by the addition of a harmonic oscillator potential which is also the generator of\nspecial conformal transformations,\nx2\n2\n\n(2)\n\n1\n(H + \u03c9 2K)\n\u03c9\n\n(3)\n\nK=\nThe new Hamiltonian is defined by\nH\u2032 =\n\nwhere we introduced a scale parameter \u03c9 (infrared cutoff). H \u2032 has a well-defined vacuum and\na discrete spectrum, which can actually be computed exactly,\nEn = 2n + 1 +\n\nq\n\ng + 1/4\n\n(4)\n\nNotice that the spectrum is independent of the arbitrary scale parameter \u03c9. The supersymmetric case can be dealt with in the same way.\nThis problem is also encountered in the quantization of a (super)particle moving in the vicinity of the horizon of a black hole [2\u20135]. The near-horizon geometry of a Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\nblack hole is AdS2 \u00d7 S n . The isometries of the AdS2 space are conformal symmetries of the\nparticle. As a result, its motion is described by (super)conformal quantum mechanics whose\nnon-relativistic limit is of the form discussed above. The DFF redefinition of the Hamiltonian\nhas a nice interpretation in this case as a redefinition of the time coordinate. The DFF Hamiltonian corresponds to a globally defined time coordinate whereas the conformally invariant\ndefinition does not. Thus, the DFF trick appears plausible on physical grounds.\nThis redefinition has also been applied to more general physical systems, such as the scattering of extended objects [6] and the interaction of extreme black holes [7]. One again obtains\na well-defined ground state after the Hamiltonian is redefined following the DFF prescription.\nHowever, the physical justification is not as lucid as in the single black hole case.\nHere, we present an alternative derivation of the DFF procedure. We show that the redefinition of the Hamiltonian amounts to a different choice of gauge. In the conformally invariant\ncase, we identify an obstruction to the standard gauge-fixing procedure that leads to a modification of the usual quantization rules. This obstruction comes from the boundary of spacetime\nand is rooted in the fact that the time coordinate is not defined at the boundary. On the other\n1\n\n\fhand, there is no obstruction in the choice of gauge leading to the DFF Hamiltonian. We conclude that the DFF Hamiltonian corresponds to a good gauge choice, whereas the conformally\ninvariant Hamiltonian does not. Our discussion is based on the standard Faddeev-Popov quantization procedure and is therefore applicable to more general systems, such as the multiple\nblack hole scattering [7], as long as the system has an underlying gauge invariance. Our results\nindicate that the DFF trick may arise from an obstruction to the Faddeev-Popov procedure at\nsome boundary of moduli space.\nOur discussion is organized as follows. In Section II, we apply the Faddeev-Popov procedure\nto a free particle moving in a fixed background of curved spacetime. We also show how the procedure is equivalent to the commutation rules one obtains from Dirac brackets. In Section III,\nwe extend the procedure by introducing an external electromagnetic field. In Section IV, we\nspecialize to the case of an extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole. We show that the DFF\ntrick is equivalent to a change of gauge. Finally, in Section V, we summarize our conclusions\nand discuss possible future directions, such as the multi-black-hole moduli space.\nII. NEUTRAL PARTICLE\n\nIn this Section, we discuss the quantization of a particle moving in a fixed spacetime background. First, we introduce the path integral for flat spacetime and apply the Faddeev-Popov\nprocedure to fix the gauge. We also show that this is equivalent to the canonical quantization\nthrough commutation relations coming from Dirac brackets. We then extend the discussion to\ngeneral curved spacetime backgrounds.\nA. Flat spacetime\n\nWe start our discussion with the more familiar case of a particle of mass m moving freely\nin flat spacetime. The action is\nS=\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 L ,\n\nL=\n\n1 \u03bc\n\u1e8b \u1e8b\u03bc \u2212 12 \u03b7m2\n2\u03b7\n\n(5)\n\nThe dynamical variables are the spacetime coordinates, x\u03bc and we will be working with the\nsignature (\u2212 + + +). Varying \u03b7, we obtain the constraint\n\u03b7 2 = \u2212\u1e8b\u03bc \u1e8b\u03bc /m2\n\n(6)\n\nThe conjugate momenta are\nP\u03bc =\n\n1\n\u2202L\n= \u1e8b\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u2202 \u1e8b\n\u03b7\n\n,\n\nP\u03b7 = 0\n\n(7)\n\n1\nP\u03bc P \u03bc + 12 m\n2m\n\n(8)\n\nThe Hamiltonian is\nH = \u1e8b\u03bc P\u03bc \u2212 L = m\u03b7\u03c7 ,\n2\n\n\u03c7=\n\n\fwhere we included a mass factor for dimensional reasons. In terms of canonical variables, the\naction reads\nS=\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 (\u1e8b\u03bc P\u03bc \u2212 m\u03b7\u03c7)\n\n(9)\n\nTherefore, \u03b7 is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the constraint\n\u03c7\u2261\n\n1\nP\u03bc P \u03bc + 21 m = 0\n2m\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is the mass-shell condition. This constraint (analogous to Gauss's Law in electrodynamics) generates reparametrizations of \u03c4 , through Poisson brackets,\n\u03b4x\u03bc = { x\u03bc , \u03c7 }P \u03b4\u03c4 =\n\n1 \u03bc\nP \u03b4\u03c4\nm\n\n\u03b4P\u03bc = { P\u03bc , \u03c7 }P \u03b4\u03c4 = 0\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nThe orbits of these gauge transformations are straight lines,\nx\u03bc =\n\nP\u03bc\n\u03c4 + x\u03bc0\nm\n\n(12)\n\nwhere P \u03bc , x\u03bc0 are constant vectors. The family of orbits in the same direction P \u03bc fills spacetime.\nNotice that we can obtain all other families by coordinate transformations (rotations).\nTo quantize the system, consider the path integral,\nZ=N\n\nZ\n\nDxDP D\u03b7 eiS = N\n\nZ\n\nDxDP \u03b4(\u03c7) ei\n\nR\n\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b\u03bc P\u03bc\n\n(13)\n\nTo define it, we need to fix the gauge by imposing the gauge-fixing condition\nh(x\u03bc ) = \u03c4\n\n(14)\n\nwhich defines a hyper-surface that cuts each orbit precisely once. Physically, this amounts to\nchoosing h(x\u03bc ) as the time coordinate. Then its conjugate momentum, H, is the Hamiltonian\nof the reduced system. Following the standard Faddeev-Popov procedure, we insert\n1=\n\nZ\n\nD\u01eb {h, \u03c7} \u03b4(h \u2212 {h, \u03c7}\u01eb \u2212 \u03c4 )\n\n(15)\n\ninto the path integral and perform a reparametrization to obtain\nZ=N\n\nZ\n\nDxDP det{h, \u03c7} \u03b4(h \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u03b4(\u03c7) ei\n\nR\n\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b\u03bc P\u03bc\n\n(16)\n\nWe may integrate over the \u03b4-functions to reduce the dimension of phase space. The reduced\nsystem will be described by coordinates xi and conjugate momenta P i . The Faddeev-Popov\ndeterminant is canceled by the integration over \u03b4(\u03c7). The momentum conjugate to h (which\nis identified with time) plays the r\u00f4le of the Hamiltonian H of the reduced system. The path\nintegral becomes\n3\n\n\fZ=N\n\nZ\n\nDxDP ei\n\nR\n\ni\n\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b P i \u2212H\n\n(17)\n\nEquivalently, we may quantize the system in the operator formalism. To this end, we need to\ncalculate Dirac brackets,\n{ A , B }D = { A , B }P \u2212 { A , \u03c7i }P { \u03c7i , \u03c7j }\u22121\nP { \u03c7j , B }P\n\n(18)\n\nwhere i, j = 1, 2, \u03c71 = \u03c7, \u03c72 = h, and promote them to commutators.\nAs an example, consider the special case h(x\u03bc ) = x0 (i.e., identify x0 with time). The\nreduced system is described by the coordinates xi = xi and the Hamiltonian is\nH = \u2212P0 =\n\nq\n\nPi P i + m2\n\n(19)\n\nThe commutation relations we obtain from the Dirac brackets are\n[Pi , xj ] = \u2212i\u03b4ij\n\n,\n\n[H , xi ] = \u2212i\n\nPi\nH\n\n(20)\n\nwhich are appropriate for H given by (19). Having understood the case of flat spacetime, we\nturn to the problem of a particle moving in a fixed background of curved spacetime.\nB. Curved spacetime\n\nIn curved spacetime, one may still use the same action as in flat space (5) and derive the\nform (9) and hence the constraint (10). The only dfference is that indices are now raised\nand lowered with the background metric g\u03bc\u03bd which is itself a function of the coordinates x\u03bc .\nTherefore the gauge transformations (11) get modified to\n\u03b4x\u03bc =\n\n1 \u03bc\nP \u03b4\u03c4\nm\n\n,\n\n\u03b4P\u03bc =\n\n1\n\u0393\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc P \u03bd P \u03bb \u03b4\u03c4\nm\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u0393\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc are the Christoffel symbols,\n\u0393\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc = 12 (\u2202\u03bb g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd g\u03bb\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc g\u03bd\u03bb )\n\n(22)\n\nThe orbits are the geodesics, which are solutions to the equations\nD\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bb\nd2 x\u03bc\ndx\u03bc\n\u03bc dx dx\n\u2261\n+\n\u0393\n=0\n\u03bd\u03bb\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4 2\nd\u03c4 d\u03c4\n\n(23)\n\nThese can also be written in terms of the conjugate momenta,\ndP\u03bc\n+ \u0393\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc P \u03bd P \u03bb = 0\nd\u03c4\n\n(24)\n\nTo fix the gauge, we need to find a family of surfaces parametrized by \u03c4 each member of which\nwill intersect the geodesics precisely once.

EXTREME REISSNER-NORDSTR\u00d6M BLACK HOLE\n\nWe are now ready to discuss the quantization of a particle moving near an extreme ReissnerNordstr\u00f6m black hole [2\u20135].

Using polar coordinates and switching variables to \u03c8, we obtain\nds2 = \u2212\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 2\n2\n2\n+ 4Q2 d\u03a923\ndt\n\u2212\nQ\nd\u03c8\n2\n\u03c8\n\n(35)\n\nDefining\nx\u00b1 = t \u00b1 Q \u03c8\n\n(36)\n\n1\ndx+ dx\u2212 + 4Q2 d\u03a923\n2\n\u03c8\n\n(37)\n\nthe metric becomes\nds2 = \u2212\nand\n\u03c8=\n\nx+ \u2212 x\u2212\n2Q\n\n(38)\n\nThe vector potential has non-vanishing components\nA+ = A\u2212 =\n\n1\n2\u03c8\n\n(39)\n\nIn four dimensions, the metric is\nds2 = \u2212\n\n1 2\ndt + \u03c8 2 d~x2\n\u03c82\n\n,\n\n\u03c8 =1+\n\nQ\n|~x|\n\n(40)\n\nand the vector potential is\nAt =\n\n1\n\u03c8\n\n~=0\nA\n\n,\n6\n\n(41)\n\n\fwhere the vectors live in a three-dimensional Euclidean space.

(37)), apart from the scale factor\nin the spherical part of the metric. Thus in both four and five dimensions, spacetime factorizes\ninto a product AdS2 \u00d7 S n (n = 2, 3, respectively). Henceforth, we shall work with AdS2 .\nThe only non-vanishing connection coefficients are \u0393\u00b1\n\u00b1\u00b1 = \u2202\u00b1 ln |g+\u2212 |. Therefore, the geodesic\n\u00b1\nequations for x are\n\u1e8d\u00b1 \u00b1 (ln |g+\u2212 |)\u2032(\u1e8b\u00b1 )2 = \u00b1\n\nq \u00b1\n\u1e8b F+\u2212\nm\n\n(45)\n\nwhere A = A+ = A\u2212 , and (ln |g+\u2212 |)\u2032 = \u2202+ ln |g+\u2212 | = \u2212\u2202\u2212 ln |g+\u2212 |. It is easy to see that the\norbits with constant \u03c8 are geodesics,\nx+ = x\u2212 + 2\u03b1Q\n\n(46)\n\nwhere \u03c8 = \u03b1, parametrized by\n\u03c4=\n\n2m\u03b1 +\n(x + x\u2212 )\nq\n\n(47)\n\nMotion along these geodesics is generated by the conjugate momentum,\nH = P+ + P\u2212\n\n(48)\n\n+\u2212\nUsing \u03c8 dA\n= \u2212A, \u03c8 dgd\u03c8\n= \u22122g+\u2212 , F+\u2212 = 2\u2202+ A, it is straightforward to show that the\nd\u03c8\nfollowing quantities are gauge-invariant (constant along geodesics)\n\nH = P+ + P\u2212\n\n,\n\nD = 2x+ P+ + 2x\u2212 P\u2212\n\n,\n\nK = (x+ )2 P+ + (x\u2212 )2 P\u2212\n\n(49)\n\n{ K , D } = 2K\n\n(50)\n\nThey obey an SL(2, R) algebra\n{ H , D } = \u22122H\n\n,\n\n{ H , K } = \u2212D\n\n,\n\nreflecting the symmetry of the AdS2 spacetime. H, D, and K generate time translations,\ndilatations, and special conformal transformations, respectively. The brackets may be Poisson\n7\n\n\for Dirac, so this is also an algebra of the gauge-fixed system, as expected.

Let us introduce a new variable x, defined by\n\u03c8=\n\nx2\n4Q2\n\n(59)\n\nIn the limit q \u2192 m, Q \u2192 \u221e, so that Q2 (m \u2212 q) remains fixed, we have\nH=\n\nP2\ng\n+ 2\n2m 2x\n\n,\n\nD = 2xP\n8\n\n,\n\nK = \u2212 12 mx2\n\n(60)\n\n\fwhere P is the momentum conjugate to x. This system does not have a well-defined vacuum.\nThe question then arises whether the underlying theory is inherently sick. One may apply the\nDFF trick to produce a Hamiltonian system with a well-defined ground state. The DFF trick\ncan be understood in this case as a different choic of time coordinate leading to a different\nHamiltonian. From our point of view, any two choices of time coordinates should be equivalent\nto each other, for they merely correspond to different gauge choices. Since the underlying theory\nis gauge-invariant, all gauge choices should be equivalent to each other.\nBefore we discuss the vacuum problem in conjunction with the gauge-fixing procedure, we\nshall introduce a class of gauges that lead to a Hamiltonian system with a well-defined ground\nstate. Let the gauge-fixing condition be\n\u03c9x+ + \u03c9x\u2212\nh(x , x ) = arctan\n1 \u2212 \u03c9 2x+ x\u2212\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n!\n\n=\u03c4\n\n(61)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is an arbitrary scale. Differentiating with respect to \u03c4 , we obtain\n\u2202+ h \u1e8b+ + \u2202\u2212 h \u1e8b\u2212 = 1 ,\n\n\u2202\u00b1 h =\n\n\u03c9\n1 + \u03c9 2 (x\u00b1 )2\n\n(62)\n\nThe Hamiltonian is\nH=\u2212\n\nP\u2212\n1\nP+\n\u2212\n= \u2212 (H + \u03c9 2 K)\n\u2202+ h \u2202\u2212 h\n\u03c9\n\n(63)\n\nIn the non-relativistic limit,\nH=\n\ng2\nP2\n+\n+ 1 m\u03c9x2\n2m\u03c9 2\u03c9x2 2\n\n(64)\n\nwhich has a well-defined vacuum. All these gauges are of course equivalent. Therefore, no\nphysical quantities should depend on the scale parameter \u03c9. In particular, notice that the\nspectrum in the non-relativistic limit is independent of \u03c9.\nIt is puzzling that there exists a gauge (Eq. (52)) in which the vacuum is not well-defined.\nTo resolve the puzzle, let us follow the Faddeev-Popov gauge-fixing procedure a little more\ncarefully. We need to insert (15) into the path integral and then perform an inverse gauge\ntransformation to eliminate the gauge parameter. In doing so, we encounter an obstruction at\nthe boundary of spacetime. Under a gauge transformation, the change in the action is\n\u03b4S =\n\nZ\n\nd\nd\u03c4\n(\u03b4x\u03bc P\u03bc ) \u2212\nd\u03c4\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 \u01eb\u03c7\u0307\n\n(65)\n\nSince \u03c7\u0307 = {\u03c7 , \u03c7} = 0, we conclude that the action changes by a total derivative,\n\u03b4S =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4\n\nd\n(\u03b4x\u03bc P\u03bc )\nd\u03c4\n\nWe have\n9\n\n(66)\n\n\f\u03b4x\u03bc = {x\u03bc , \u03c7} \u01eb =\n\n\u2202\u03c7\n\u01eb\n\u2202P\u03bc\n\n(67)\n\ntherefore,\n\u03b4S = P\u03bc\n\n\u2202\u03c7\n\u01eb\n\u2202P\u03bc\n\n(68)\n\u2202\n\nNotice that, if the generator of gauge transformations, \u03c7, is quadratic in the momenta (as in the\nfree particle case (10)), then the boundary contribution vanishes after imposing the constraint\n\u03c7 = 0. In our case, \u03c7 (Eq. (30)) is not quadratic in the momenta, due to the presence of the\nvector potential. Therefore \u03b4S 6= 0 and we cannot in general get rid of the gauge parameter\non the boundary of spacetime. In the set of gauges (61), there is no boundary contribution,\nbecause the Faddeev-Popov determinant vanishes there. Indeed,\n{h, \u03c7} \u221d\n\nP+\nP\u2212\n+\n2\n+\n2\n1 + \u03c9 (x )\n1 + \u03c9 2 (x\u2212 )2\n\n(69)\n\nwhich vanishes as x\u00b1 \u2192 \u221e. For the gauge (52), we obtain a boundary contribution to the path\nintegral,\nZ\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\u2202\u03c7\n\u01eb\nd\u01ebd xd P { h , \u03c7 } \u03b4(h \u2212 \u03c4 )\u03b4(\u03c7) exp iP\u03bc\n\u2202P\u03bc\n\u2202\nD\n\nD\n\n(70)\n\nThis obstruction is absent when { h , \u03c7 } = 0 at the boundary. Physically, this condition implies\nthat the boundary of spacetime is invariant under transformations generated by h, which is the\ntime coordinate after gauge-fixing (h = \u03c4 ). In other words, the boundary is fixed under time\ntranslations. Thus the time coordinate (52) is not a good global coordinate and leads to an\nobstruction in the gauge invariance of the theory. Integrating over the gauge parameter, we\nobtain an additional constraint at the boundary,\nP\u03bc\n\n\u2202\u03c7\n\u2202P\u03bc\n\n=0\n\n(71)\n\n\u2202\n\nThis alters the standard commutation relations and the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian (54) or (60). We have not carried out an explicit computation. This would involve the\nintroduction of a regulator which would break gauge invariance. Nevertheless, the resulting\nsystem should be equivalent to the one obtained through the other choices of gauge due to the\ngauge invariance of the theory.\nTo summarize, the na\u0131\u0308ve identification of the time coordinate (52) leads to an obstruction\nin the gauge-fixing procedure for the path integral. If this obstruction is accounted for by an\nappropriate modification of the commutation relations, this choice of the time coordinate leads\nto a well-defined Hamiltonian problem. The Hamiltonian system thus obtained is equivalent to\napplying the DFF trick [1], or identifying the time coordinate as in Eq. (61) [5]. The latter is\nmerely a different gauge choice in a gauge-invariant theory.\n10\n\n\fV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe considered the problem of quantization of a charged particle in the vicinity of the horizon\nof an extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole. In this case, the vacuum is not well-defined unless\na special choice of the time coordinate is made [5]. This has been shown to be equivalent to\nthe DFF trick for conformal quantum mechanics [1]. We approached this problem through the\npath integral and the Faddeev-Popov gauge-fixing procedure. We showed that the DFF trick\ncan be understood in terms of the standard Faddeev-Popov procedure.\nWe started with a general discussion of the quantization of a particle in the presence of a\nbackground metric field as well as an external vector potential. We performed the standard\nFaddeev-Popov procedure in the canonical formalism and showed its connection to commutation\nrelations through Dirac brackets. We then applied the procedure to the case of interest (extreme\nReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole). We showed that the na\u0131\u0308ve identification of time coordinate\n(which leads to a Hamiltonian system with no well-defined ground state) corresponds to a gauge\nwhich is not \"good.\" We found that in this gauge the Faddeev-Popov procedure encounters an\nobstruction at the boundary of spacetime introducing an additional constraint there. This alters\nthe standard commutation relations and the eigenvalue problem for the attendant Hamiltonian\nsystem. We did not calculate the effects of this obstruction explicitly. This would require\nthe introduction of a regulator which would break gauge invariance explicitly and therefore\nalter the commutation rules. Instead, we exhibited another set of gauges where no obstruction\nexisted on the boundary. We showed that this set of gauges led to a Hamiltonian system with\na well-defined vacuum, equivalent to the one obtained through the DFF trick [1].\nA choice of gauge is equivalent to a choice of time coordinate, because gauge transformations\nare reparametrizations of the proper time of the particle. The above discussion shows that all\nchoices of the time coordinate are equivalent since they correspond to different gauge choices\nin a gauge-invariant theory. It would be interesting to apply our procedure to multiple black\nhole scattering, where the study of moduli space seems to necessitate the introduction of the\nDFF trick [7]. It is hard to see how this can be justified in terms of a \"proper\" choice of a time\ncoordinate (which time coordinate?). However, the underlying theory is a gauge theory, so the\nFaddeev-Popov procedure should be applicable. Our results indicate that one may encounter\nan obstruction to the implementation of the procedure, perhaps on some boundary of moduli\nspace, which would lead to an alteration of the na\u0131\u0308ve Hamiltonian system similar to the DFF\ntrick. Work in this direction is in progress.\n\n11\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] V. de Alfaro, S. Fubini and G. Furlan, Nuovo Cimento 34A (1976) 569.\n[2] P. Claus, M. Derix, R. Kallosh, J. Kumar, P. K.
