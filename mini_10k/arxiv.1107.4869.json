Introduction\nLet M denote a smooth manifold equipped with a volume form \u03bc. For\nsimplicity, assume M is closed and connected. We will discuss the flux\nhomomorphism (see [Ban97] and the references therein), which is defined for\nany volume-preserving isotopy, in the cases the manifold admits a symplectic\nform (if M is even-dimensional) or a contact form (if M is odd-dimensional),\nand the volume form in question is the canonical one (up to scaling) induced\nby the symplectic or contact form. By passing to an appropriate quotient of\nthe codimension 1 cohomology group of the underlying manifold, the flux is\nalso defined for the time-one maps, i.e. volume-preserving diffeomorphisms\nisotopic to the identity. For all our purposes it is sufficient to study the flux\nhomomorphism on the Lie algebras of symplectic and strictly contact vector\nfields, which is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014Z 1\n\u03b9(Xt )\u03bc dt \u2208 H dim M \u22121 (M, R).\nFlux({Xt }0\u2264t\u22641 ) =\n0\n\nThe flux of a volume-preserving isotopy {\u03c6t }0\u2264t\u22641 is by definition the flux\nof its infinitesimal generator {Xt }0\u2264t\u22641 , that is, the smooth family of vector\nd\n\u03c6t = Xt \u25e6 \u03c6t .\nfields uniquely determined by dt\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53D35.\nKey words and phrases.

Symplectic manifolds\nIn this section, \u03c9 denotes a symplectic form on M 2n , and the volume form\nis the induced Liouville volume form \u03c9 n . There is a symplectic version of\nthe flux homomorphism1 defined by\n\u0015\n\u0014Z 1\n\u03b9(Xt )\u03c9 dt \u2208 H 1 (M, R)\nFlux({Xt }0\u2264t\u22641 ) =\n0\n\nfor {Xt }0\u2264t\u22641 a smooth family of symplectic vector fields. All the results\nrecalled in this section are well-known.\nProposition 1 ([Ban78b]). The flux homomorphisms for symplectic and\nfor volume-preserving isotopies are both surjective, and are related (up to\nmultiplication with the constant factor n) by the map\n(1)\n\n\u2227 [\u03c9 n\u22121 ] : H 1 (M, R) \u2192 H 2n\u22121 (M, R), [\u03b2] 7\u2192 [\u03b2 \u2227 \u03c9 n\u22121 ].\n\nIn particular, the flux of a Hamiltonian isotopy vanishes, and the image of\nthe flux map restricted to symplectic isotopies coincides with the image of\nthe map \u2227[\u03c9 n\u22121 ].\nWe remark that the map \u2227[\u03c9 n\u22121 ] in equation (1) coincides up to the\n(nonsingular) cup product pairing with the pairing\nZ\n1\n1\n\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 \u2227 \u03c9 n\u22121 .\n(2)\nH (M, R) \u00d7 H (M, R) \u2192 R, ([\u03b1], [\u03b2]) 7\u2192\nM\n\nExample 2. If H 1 (M, R) = 0, the restriction of the flux to symplectic\nisotopies vanishes identically. By duality, H 1 (M, R) and H 2n\u22121 (M, R) have\nthe same rank over R, so the flux is in fact trivial on the full group of\nvolume-preserving isotopies. This is the case for example for M = S 2 , or\nmore generally, any complex projective space.\nExample 3. If the map in equation (1) is an isomorphism, (M, \u03c9) is said to\nbe of Lefschetz type. This class contains all K\u00e4hler manifolds, such as tori,\ncomplex projective spaces, and surfaces. Tori in all dimensions and surfaces\nof genus greater than zero of course have nontrivial first cohomology groups.\nExample 4. If H 1 (M, R) has rank 1, the pairing in equation (2) vanishes\nfor degree reasons, and thus the map in equation (1) is trivial. However, as\nremarked above, H 2n\u22121 (M, R) is nontrivial in this case, and since the flux is\nsurjective, the image of the flux restricted to symplectic isotopies is properly\nsmaller than the image of the flux on the full group of volume-preserving\nisotopies.\n1Throughout this note, in the absence of the prefix symplectic, the name flux always\n\nrefers to the map defined in Section 1.\n\n\fFLUX OF STRICTLY CONTACT ISOTOPIES\n\n3\n\n3. Contact manifolds\nIn this section, \u03b1 denotes a contact form on a contact manifold (M 2n+1 , \u03be),\nand the induced volume form is \u03b1 \u2227 (d\u03b1)n . An isotopy {\u03c6t }0\u2264t\u22641 is said\nto be contact if it preserves the contact structure \u03be, or equivalently, its\ninfinitesimal generator {Xt }0\u2264t\u22641 is contact, that is, it satisfies LXt \u03b1 = ht \u03b1\nfor all 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1, where ht is a smooth function on M . To every contact\nisotopy corresponds a unique smooth function H : [0, 1] \u00d7 M \u2192 R, defined\nby \u03b1(Xt ) = Ht , and conversely, every (time-dependent) smooth function H\ndefines a unique contact isotopy. This function is often called the contact\nHamiltonian of the isotopy {\u03c6t }. If {Xt } is in addition divergence-free, then\nht = 0, that is, Xt preserves the contact form \u03b1. Equivalently, {\u03c6t } is also\nvolume-preserving, and thus preserves the contact form \u03b1, i.e. \u03c6\u2217t \u03b1 = \u03b1 for\nall 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1. In that case, both Xt and \u03c6t are called strictly contact. This\nnotion depends on the contact form \u03b1 and not just on the contact structure\n\u03be = ker \u03b1. The unique strictly contact vector field R\u03b1 corresponding to the\nconstant function 1 is called the Reeb vector field, and its flow the Reeb flow.\nThe isotopy {\u03c6t } is strictly contact if and only if its Hamiltonian is invariant\nunder the Reeb flow. These functions are also known as basic functions.\nt } is a smooth family of strictly contact vector\nProposition 5. If XH = {XH\nfields (or equivalently, H is a time-dependent basic function) on M , then\n\u0014Z 1\n\u0015\nn\nHt dt * (d\u03b1) .\n(3)\nFlux(XH ) = (n + 1)\n0\n\nThis means in particular the image of the flux has a single 'generator'\n(d\u03b1)n over the algebra Cb\u221e (M ) of basic functions on M . Note H 2n (M, R)\ncan be quite 'large': if M is a closed, orientable 3-manifold, and \u03a3 = \u03a3g is\na closed, orientable surface of genus g, then there exists a contact structure\non M \u00d7 \u03a3, and H 4 (M \u00d7 \u03a3) has rank at least 2g.\nProof. A straightforward computation yields\n\n\u0001\nt\nt\n\u03b9(XH\n) (\u03b1 \u2227 (d\u03b1)n ) = Ht (d\u03b1)n \u2212 n \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b9(XH\n)d\u03b1 \u2227 (d\u03b1)n\u22121 .\n\nt is divergence-free, the left-hand side is closed by Cartan's\nNote that since XH\nt\nformula. Since XH is strictly contact,\n\u0001\nt\nt\nt\n)\u03b1 + \u03b9(XH\n)d\u03b1 = dHt + \u03b9(XH\n)d\u03b1.\n(4)\n0 = LXHt \u03b1 = d \u03b9(XH\n\nCombining the above, we obtain\n\nt\n\u03b9(XH\n) (\u03b1 \u2227 (d\u03b1)n ) = (Ht d\u03b1 + n \u03b1 \u2227 dHt ) \u2227 (d\u03b1)n\u22121 .\n\nThe equality\nd(Ht \u03b1) = dHt \u2227 \u03b1 + Ht d\u03b1 = Ht d\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2227 dHt\nshows that Ht d\u03b1 + n \u03b1 \u2227 dHt coincides with (n + 1)Ht d\u03b1 up to an exact\nform, proving the proposition.\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\nSTEFAN M\u00dcLLER\n\nIn particular, we showed that Ht (d\u03b1)n is a closed form (and thus so is\n\u03b1 \u2227 dHt \u2227 (d\u03b1)n\u22121 ). This can also be seen directly:\n1\nt\nt\nd(Ht (d\u03b1)n ) = \u2212(\u03b9(XH\n)d\u03b1) \u2227 (d\u03b1)n = \u2212\n\u03b9(XH\n)(d\u03b1)n+1\nn+1\nwhich vanishes for dimension reasons (we have used equation (4) here), and\nd(\u03b1 \u2227 dHt \u2227 (d\u03b1)n\u22121 ) = dHt \u2227 (d\u03b1)n = d(Ht (d\u03b1)n ) = 0.\nCorollary 6. The flux of the Reeb flow vanishes.\nProof. By Proposition 5, Flux(R\u03b1 ) = (n + 1)[(d\u03b1)n ] = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 7. If (M, \u03b1) is regular (i.e. the Reeb vector field determines a\nfree S 1 -action), the flux of any strictly contact isotopy vanishes identically.\nProof. Denote by (B, \u03c9) the quotient of (M, \u03b1) by the Reeb flow, and by\np : M \u2192 B the natural projection. The map p\u2217 : C \u221e (B) \u2192 Cb\u221e (M, \u03b1)\nis an (algebra) isomorphism, so Ht (d\u03b1)n = p\u2217 (Ft \u03c9 n ) for a smooth family\nof not necessarily mean value zero normalized Hamiltonians Ft on B. See\n[BW58, Ban78a]. Then\nZ\nZ\n1\nn\nFt \u03c9 n\n(Ft \u2212 ct ) \u03c9 = 0, where ct = R n\n\u03c9\nB\nB\nB\nis the mean value of Ft on B with respect to the volume form \u03c9 n . That\nmeans the 2n-form (Ft \u2212 ct ) \u03c9 n = d\u03b3t is exact, and therefore\n\n(5)\n\nHt (d\u03b1)n = (Ht \u2212 ct )(d\u03b1)n + ct (d\u03b1)n = d(p\u2217 \u03b3t + ct \u03b1 \u2227 (d\u03b1)n\u22121 )\n\nis an exact form on M . The claim now follows from Proposition 5.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe identity in equation (5) is used in [MS11a] to calculate an explicit\nformula for the helicity of a strictly contact vector field on a regular contact\n3-manifold.\nThe pair (M, \u03b1) is regular if and only if it is the prequantization bundle\nof a (necessarily integral) symplectic manifold (B, \u03c9). From this it is easy to\nconstruct contact manifolds (M, \u03be = ker \u03b1) where the flux (when restricted\nto strictly contact isotopies with respect to \u03b1) is not surjective.\nExample 8. Choose a closed and connected manifold B 2n with integral\nsymplectic form \u03c9, whose fundamental group is not perfect. For example,\nany torus T 2n with its standard symplectic form. Let (M 2n+1 , \u03b1) be its\nprequantization bundle. From the long exact sequence on homotopy of the\np\nbundle S 1 \u0592\u2192 M \u2192 B, we see the homomorphism p\u2217 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 \u03c01 (B)\nis surjective, and in particular, \u03c01 (M ) is nontrivial. By hypothesis, the\nabelianization H1 (M, R) of \u03c01 (M ) is nontrivial. Then by Poincar\u00e9 duality,\nH 2n (M, R) \u223c\n= H1 (M, R) 6= 0. But by Corollary 7, the flux is trivial on\nstrictly contact isotopies.\nFor strictly contact S 1 -actions, we note the following (which gives another\nproof of Corollary 6 in those cases where the Weinstein conjecture holds).\n\n\fFLUX OF STRICTLY CONTACT ISOTOPIES\n\n5\n\nProposition 9. If the vector field X induces a strictly contact S 1 -action\non (M, \u03b1) that has at least one contractible orbit, then the induced strictly\ncontact isotopy has vanishing flux.\nProof. The orbits of the S 1 -action are all homologous, and since there exists\na contractible orbit, the represented homology class \u03b2X is zero. It is easy\nto see that \u03b2X is Poincar\u00e9 dual to the cohomology class of \u03b9(X)(\u03b1 \u2227 (d\u03b1)n ),\nand therefore the flux vanishes.\n\u0003\nExample 10. Let M = T 3 be the 3-torus with contact form\n\u03b1 = cos z dx \u2212 sin z dy,\nwhere x, y, z \u2208 R/(2\u03c0Z) are the coordinates on T 3 . We compute\nd\u03b1 = sin z dx \u2227 dz + cos z dy \u2227 dz,\nso that the Reeb vector field is given by\nR\u03b1 = cos z\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 sin z\n.\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\nIn particular, any function on M that depends only on z is basic. The\ninduced volume form \u03b1 \u2227 d\u03b1 = dx \u2227 dy \u2227 dz is the standard volume form on\nT 3 . Choosing H = sin z /(2\u03c0)2 and H = cos z /(2\u03c0)2 , Proposition 5 gives\n\u03b9(XH ) = dx \u2227 dz and dy \u2227 dz respectively. By equation (3), the 2-form\ndx \u2227 dy does not lie in the image of the flux when restricted to strictly\ncontact isotopies.\nAnother way of seeing this is the following lemma, which shows that a\nbasic function on (T 3 , \u03b1) is always independent of x and y.\nLemma 11. In the situation above, any basic function Ht is independent\nof x and y. In particular, Cb\u221e (T 3 , \u03b1) \u223c\n= C \u221e (S 1 ).\nProof. For fixed x0 , y0 \u2208 S 1 , denote by \u2206 the function\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202Ht \u2202Ht\n,\n(x0 , y0 , z).\n\u2206 = \u2206x0 ,y0 : z 7\u2192\n\u2202x \u2202y\nWe note when the 'slope' \u2212 tan z0 is irrational, the Reeb orbits are dense\nin the z = z0 -'plane', and thus the map (x, y) 7\u2192 Ht (x, y, z0 ) is constant.\nConsequently, for any choice of x0 and y0 above, the function \u2206 vanishes at\nall 'angles' z0 with irrational tan z0 . By continuity, it must be identically\nzero, proving the claim.\nAlternatively, fix z \u2208 S 1 and consider the Fourier series of\nX\nHz (x, y) = H(x, y, z) =\nhj,k ei(jx+ky) .\nj,k\n\nIf H is basic, then R\u03b1 .Hz (x, y) = R\u03b1 .H(x, y, z) = 0, or\ncos z\n\n\u2202Hz\n\u2202Hz\n= sin z\n,\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\n\f6\n\nSTEFAN M\u00dcLLER\n\nwhich in terms of the Fourier coefficients is equivalent to j cos z = k sin z for\nall j, k with hj,k 6= 0. If tan z is irrational, hj,k must vanish for all j, k except\npossibly the constant term h0,0 . In other words, the partial derivatives of H\nin the direction of x and y vanish at all points (x, y, z) with tan z irrational.\nBy the same argument as above, H is independent of x and y.\n\u0003\nBy the previous lemma, given two linearly independent cotangent vectors\nat a point y \u2208 T 3 , it is not possible to construct a basic function G with\npartial derivatives in a prescribed direction equal to the given cotangent vectors. This is where L. Polterovich's argument on regularizing a Hamiltonian\nisotopy [Pol01, Section 5.2] breaks down in the strictly contact case. See\n[MS11a] for details and a proof in the contact case.\nExample 12. Let M = T n+1 \u00d7 S n , with contact form\nn\nX\n\u03b1=\nyk dxk ,\nk=0\n\nwhere x0 , . . . , xn \u2208 R/Z are coordinates on T n+1 , andP\ny0 , . . . , yn are coordinates on the unit sphere S n \u2282 Rn+1 . Clearly d\u03b1 = \u2212 dxk \u2227 dyk , and\nn\nX\nn(n+1)\nn\ndk . . . \u2227 dxn \u2227 dy0 \u2227 . . . dy\ndk . . . \u2227 dyn ,\n2\nn!\ndx0 \u2227 . . . dx\n(d\u03b1) = (\u22121)\nk=0\n\ndk (or dy\ndk ) means that index is omitted. The Reeb vector field is\nwhere dx\nn\nX\n\u2202\n,\nR\u03b1 =\nyk\n\u2202xk\nk=0\n\nand thus the functions\nn(n+1)\n\n(\u22121) 2 +k\n* yk\n(6)\nHk =\ncn * n!\nare basic, where cn = vol(S n ) denotes the volume of the unit n-sphere with\nrespect to the standard volume form\nn\nX\nn\ndk . . . \u2227 dyn .\ndVol = dVol(S ) =\n(\u22121)k yk dy0 \u2227 . . . dy\nk=0\n\nA similar argument as in Lemma 11 proves Cb\u221e (T n+1 \u00d7 S n , \u03b1) \u223c\n= C \u221e (S n ).\nAssume for now that n > 1. The standard basis {ak } of H2n (M, R) can be\nrepresented by the embedded submanifolds {xk = 0}. A direct computation\nshows\nZ\n(n + 1)Hk (d\u03b1)n = \u03b4jk ,\naj\n\ni.e. {(n+1)[Hk\nforms a basis of H 2n (M, R) dual to the standard basis\n{ak } of H2n (M, R). That shows the flux is surjective even when restricted\nto strictly contact isotopies. In fact, the map\ndk . . . \u2227 dxn \u2227 dVol 7\u2192 \u03a6H\ndx0 \u2227 . . . dx\n(d\u03b1)n ]}\n\nk\n\n\fFLUX OF STRICTLY CONTACT ISOTOPIES\n\n7\n\ndefines a continuous homomorphic section of the flux. If n = 1, the contact\nform \u03b1 is diffeomorphic to the one in Example 10.\nRecall the flux can be interpreted as an obstruction to fragmentation of\na vector field [Ban97, page 15]. Strictly contact vector fields do not posses\nthe fragmentation property in general.\n4. Continuity of the flux homomorphism\nR\nLet \u03bc denote a volume form on M , normalized so that M \u03bc = 1. Recall\nthe usual identification of H1 (M, R) with Hom([M, S 1 ], R), via identification\nof H 1 (M, Z) with [M, S 1 ], applying the Hom(\u2212, Z) functor, and then taking\nthe tensor product with R.\nProposition 13 ([Fat80]). The flux homomorphism Flux is Poincar\u00e9 dual\nto the mass flow homomorphism \u0398, and the latter is C 0 -continuous. More\nprecisely, let \u03c3 denote the canonical volume form on S 1 given by the natural\norientation of the circle. Then for any f : M \u2192 S 1 ,\nZ\nFlux(X) \u2227 f \u2217 \u03c3 = \u0398(X)(f ).\nM\n\nAs a consequence of this proposition, we can define the flux or mass flow\nof a topological or continuous Hamiltonian, symplectic, strongly symplectic, or strictly contact isotopy [MO07, M\u00fcl08, Ban10, BS11] by extending\ncontinuously. The proof of the following lemma, which completely determines the image of the above continuous extensions of the flux (or mass\nflow) homomorphism, is straightforward.\nLemma 14. If a vector field X is divergence-free (symplectic, strictly contact), then \u03bb * X is divergence-free (symplectic, strictly contact) for any\n\u03bb \u2208 R, and Flux(\u03bbX) = \u03bb * Flux(X). The flux homomorphism (as well as\nthe restriction to symplectic or strictly contact vector fields) is a homomorphism of vector spaces. Thus the image is a linear subspaces of H k (M, R),\nwhere k = dim M \u2212 1, and in particular is closed.\nA similar remark applies when passing to the groups of time-one maps.\nFor symplectic vector fields, the last part of the lemma also follows from\nequation (1), and for strictly contact vector fields from Proposition 5. By\ncomposing with the inverse of the (vector space) isomorphism that assigns to a strictly contact vector field X the basic function \u03b1(X), the\nflux homomorphism can also be viewed as a (vector space) homomorphism\nCb\u221e (M ) \u2192 H k (M, R). Under the above identification of H1 (M, R) with\nHom([M, S 1 ], R), we have the following explicit formula for the mass flow of\na strictly contact isotopy.\nProposition 15. The mass flow of a strictly contact isotopy generated by a\nbasic contact Hamiltonian H : [0, 1] \u00d7 M \u2192 R, and evaluated on a function\n\n\f8\n\nSTEFAN M\u00dcLLER\n\nf : M \u2192 S 1 , is given by the formula\n\u0013\nZ \u0012Z 1\nHt dt * (R\u03b1 .f ) \u03bc,\n(n + 1)\nM\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03bc = \u03b1 \u2227 (d\u03b1)n is the canonical volume form on M 2n+1 induced by \u03b1.\nProof. Combine Proposition 5 and Proposition 13.\n\n\u0003\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe first part of Example 10 (the image of the flux has rank at least\ntwo) was worked out jointly with A.
