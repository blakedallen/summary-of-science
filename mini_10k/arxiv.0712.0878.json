In the present letter\nwe show that for nanotubes quite different results are valid: \u01eb becomes infinitely large at the\nsingular point and the Friedel oscillations do not play the dominant role in the screening at the\nlarge distances. Moreover, the zero and highest cylindrical harmonics of the effective potential are\nscreened by quite different mechanisms.\n\nCollective effects in quasi-1D systems are remarkable\nby a number of distinguishing features. Probably the most\nnon-trivial one relates to the strictly 1D system of interacting fermions with the linear single particle dispersion law\n(the Luttinger model). However, there exist also different\n1D objects not described in terms of the Luttinger liquid\nfirst of all due to necessity to account for the transversal\nsubbands and transitions between them. The corresponding example is a nanotube - a hollow cylinder with 2D\nelectron gas on its surface. As usually, availability of the\nmobile electrons results in renormalization of the electron\n- electron interaction, i.e., screening. The specific form\nof the screened e-e interaction is determined by the effective dimension and by the energy spectrum of the electron\ngas. As is known in 3D plasma the bare Coulomb interaction is replaced (due to screening) by the Yukawa law plus\nthe Friedel oscillations cos (2pF r)/r3 if the electron gas is\ndegenerate; here pF is the Fermi momentum, r is the distance from a point charge, and h\u0304 = 1. Similar results in\nthe 2D case read: the regular part of the screened potential at r \u2192 \u221e is Qa2B /r3 [1], where Q is the initial point\ncharge, aB is the effective Bohr radius, whereas the oscillating contribution is proportional to cos(2pF r \u2212 \u03c0/4)/r2 .\nWe see that both in 3D and in 2D problems the Kohn\nsingularity of \u01eb(k) at k = 2pF gives the leading term of\nthe screened potential for r \u2192 \u221e; here \u01eb(k) is the static\npermittivity depending on the momentum k.\nConsider now a nanotube with the semiconductor type\nof the single particle energy spectrum:\n\u03b5p,l =\n\n1\np2\n,\n+ Bl2 ; B \u2261\n2m\n2ma2\n\nl = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12..... (1)\n\nHere p is the electron momentum parallel to the tube axis,\nl is the number of the subband, m is the effective mass and\na is the nanotube radius. Thus, the problem in question\ndiffers from the similar one for a planar 2D system by\nonly quantization of one of the component of momentum:\npx = l/a. The considered system is infinite and uniform in\nz-direction (the nanotube axis) and periodic and uniform\nin the azimuthal direction \u03c6 . Hence, the electron Green\nfunction G depends on only differences z \u2212 z \u2032 , \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 . In\nthe Fourier representation G is diagonal: G(p, p\u2032 ; l, l\u2032 ) =\n\u03b4pp\u2032 \u03b4ll\u2032 G(p, l).\nIn what follows we will apply the standard diagram technic to find the e \u2212 e interaction renormalized by screening\nand we will use the linear theory of screening. We are\naware that in strictly 1D system with linear single-particle\ndispersion law the Luttinger liquid model is valid. The linear screening theory relates to only long-wave length limit.\nThis theory breaks down for the momentum of the order\nof pF just when the Friedel oscillations become essential\n[2\u20134].1\nHowever we actually deal with 2D object and we use\nthe parabolic dispersion law for electrons. For such a situation the Luttinger model is not applicable and we do not\nhave any other instrument except RPA to investigate the\nproblem. After that it is not surprising that our results\nfor the Friedel contribution to the screened potential differ\nqualitatively from the ones obtained in [2\u20134] and also [5].\n1 There is a misprint in the eq.(8) of ref. [2]. Asymptotic be2\nhavior of the screened potential\nR Uef f must be 1/|x| ln |x/d| rather\nthan 1/|x| ln |x/d|, otherwise Uef f (x)dx diverges while the Fourier\ncomponent U ef f (q) remains finite at q \u2192 0.\n\np-1\n\n\fA.V. Chaplik et al.\nThe main difference is dependence of our effective\n(screened) potential not only on z (coordinate along the\ntube axis) but also on \u03c6 - azimuthal separation between\ntwo electrons on the surface of a hollow cylinder. We discovered that average potential (zero cylindrical harmonic)\nand all the other harmonics are screened qualitatively different.\nWe guess that in the present situation - there is an exactly solvable model but for only strictly 1D system with\nlinear dispersion law and an approximate method for general case - it is worth to find general results within RPA\nand to see what experiments will show. This will be done\nin what follows.\nThe Gell-Mann-Brueckner [6] chain of electron loops determining the Fourier component of the screened e-e interaction V (k, n) comes to the geometrical progression:\nV (k, n) =\n\nV (0) (k, n)\n,\n1 + V (0) (k, n)\u03a0(\u03c9; k, n)\n\nwhere V (0) is the bare Coulomb interaction:\nZ \u221e Z 2\u03c0\ne\u2212ikz\u2212in\u03c6 dzd\u03c6\n(0)\n2\nq\nV (k, n) = \u1ebd\n=\n\u2212\u221e 0\nz 2 + 4a2 sin2 (\u03c6/2)\n\n= 4\u03c0\u1ebd2 In (|k|a)Kn (|k|a),\n\n(2)\n\nL is the number of p\nthe highest occupied subband at zero\ntemperature, pl = 2m(EF \u2212 Bl2 )\nis the Fermi momentum of the l-th subband. Eq. (7)\ndemonstrates\nthe qualitative difference of the quasi-1D problem and the\n2D and 3D problems. In 2D and 3D systems the Kohn\nsingularity at k = 2pF gives small corrections to the regular part of the polarization operator: \u03be ln |\u03be| in 3D [7] and\np\n|\u03be| in 2D case, where \u03be = (k \u2212 2pF )/2pF \u226a 1. But in\n1D situation \u03a00 (k) becomes infinitely large at k = 2pl and\nthe renormalized interaction vanishes at these points.\nTo calculate V0 (z) in the regime |z| >> a we write in\nthe eq. (6) cos (kz) = Re(exp(ikz)), and turn the path of\nintegration to the upper imaginary semiaxis. At large |z|\nwe have two contributions to V0 (z): V 0 from the point k =\n0, where K0 has logarithmic singularity but \u03a00 remains\nfinite, and a number of the Kohn contributions from the\npoints k = 2pl resulting in the Friedel oscillations Ve0 (z).\nFor the non-oscillating part V 0 (z) we get the expansion in\ninverse powers of the value \u039b \u2261 ln (2|z|/a) \u2212 C ( C is the\nEuler constant)\n\nV 0 (z) =\n(3)\n\nHere \u1ebd2 = e2 /\u03c7, \u03c7 is the background dielectric constant,\nIn , Kn are the modified Bessel functions of the 1-th and\nthe 3-rd type.

By transforming V (k, n)\nfrom eq. (2) back to z-space we obtain the expansion\nof the screened interaction in cylindrical harmonics. As\nV (0) (k, n) and \u03a0(0; k, n) are even functions of n we come\nto the series\nZ \u221e\ndk\nexp (ikz)(V (k, 0) +\nV (z, \u03c6) =\n2\n\u2212\u221e (2\u03c0)\n\u221e\nX\n+2\nV (k, n) cos (n\u03c6)).\n(5)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u1ebd2 maB \u00012\nmaB /\u03c0\u03ba0 + 4C\n1\u2212\n+ * * * , (8)\nz 4\u03c0\u03ba0 \u039b\n2\u039b\n\nPL\nwhere \u03ba0 \u2261 \u03a00 (k \u2192 0) = m[1/p0 + 2 l=1 (1/pl )]/\u03c0 2 ;\n\u03c0\u03ba0 is the sum of the partial density of states in occupied\nsubbands. Thus, the Coulomb interaction in nanotubes is\nscreened rather weakly, V 0 (z) \u223c e2 /(z ln2 (z/a)).\nTo find the oscillating part Ve0 (z) we consider a small\nvicinity of the point k = 2pl and note that the factor\n\u1ebd2 I0 K0 in the integrand of eq. (6) cancels. Thus, we see yet\nanother peculiarity of the 1D problem: Friedel oscillations\nof the screened potential do not depend on the charge!\n(see below eqs. (9), (18)). This is due to infinitely large\nmagnitude of \u03a00 (k) at k = 2pl . Then one can introduce\nthe parameter \u03be = (k \u2212 2pl )/2pl and take the integral over\n\u03be from \u2212\u221e till \u221e. By the same shift of the integration\npath as described above we arrive at the series in powers\nof 1/ ln (4pl z):\n\nVe0 (z) = \u2212\n\nl=L\nX\n2C\n2\u03c0 2 pl cos(2pl z)\n+ . . .] (9)\n[1 \u2212\nm z ln2 (4pl z)\nln (4pl z)\n\nl=\u2212L\n\nWe see that the amplitude of the Friedel oscillations in\nnanotubes decreases with increasing distance not slower\nn=1\nthan the regular part V 0 (z) does. Moreover, the ratio\nThe slowest decreasing term at |z| \u2192 \u221e is given by the Ve0 /V 0 at any z in the order of magnitude can be estimated\nzero harmonic and reads\nas 1/(pF aB ), and for \"metallic\" limit of the dense electron\nZ \u221e\n2\ngas (pF aB \u226b 1) the Friedel oscillations become negligibly\n4\u03c0\u1ebd I0 (ka)K0 (ka)\ndk\ncos (kz)\n,\n(6)\nV0 (z) =\nsmall.\n\u03c0\n1 + 4\u03c0\u1ebd2 \u03a00 (k)I0 (ka)K0 (ka)\n0\nQualitatively different results are obtained for non-zero\nwhere\nharmonics.

Indeed, from eq.

The\nregular part of the screened interaction stems again from\nthe region of small k. Eq. (4) gives:\nIm(\u03a0(k, n)|k=0 = 0,\nL\nm X\n(k 2 a2 + n2 + 2kpl a2 )2 \u2212 4n2 l2\nRe(\u03a0(k, n)) = 2\nln\n2\u03c0 k\n(k 2 a2 + n2 \u2212 2kpl a2 )2 \u2212 4n2 l2\n\u2212L\n\nand there are two possibilities for the quantity \u03ban \u2261\n\u03a0(0, n).

(11). First of\nall one can see that such contributions exist not for all\nvalues of n. For a fixed concentration of electrons pF a \u2264 L\nwhereas the singularity in the right-hand-side of eq. (11)\noccurs only if p2F a2 > (n \u2212 l)2 with |l| < L. Thus, the\nFriedel oscillations of the n-th harmonic exist for n \u2264 2L\nbut for n > 2L we have only non-oscillating contribution\nV n (z) given by eq. (14). The calculation of the oscillating\npart Ven (z) for n \u2264 2L is totally similar to the derivation\nof eq. (9).
