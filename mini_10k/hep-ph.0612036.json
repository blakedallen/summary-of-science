Introduction\nAlthough the standard model (SM) has been precisely tested by experiments, it is\nwidely believed to be only an effective theory valid below some high energy scales. New\nphysics should exist at energy scales around T eV . Most of the new physics models predict\nthe existence of the new neutral gauge boson Z \u2032 associated with the extra U(1) subgroup\nof the underlying group. The phenomenology of this kind of new particles has been\nextensively studied in either model-dependent or model-independent approaches[1], whose\npresence will be of great interest in the next generation collider experiments [2].\nTopcolor scenario is attractive because it explains the large top quark mass and provides possible dynamics mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking (EW SB)[3]. A\ncommon feature of this kind of models is that the SM gauge groups are extended at energy well above the weak scale. Breaking of the extended gauge groups to their diagonal\nsubgroups produces new massive gauge bosons. To generate enough large mass for top\nquark, the extended gauge groups are generally flavor non-universal, which predict the existence of the non-universal gauge bosons. For instance, the topcolor-assisted technicolor\n(T C2) model [4] and the flavor universal T C2 model [5] predict the non-universal neutral\ngauge boson Z \u2032 , which treats the third generation fermions differently from those in the\nfirst and second generations. Possible signals of the gauge boson Z \u2032 have been studied in\nthe literature [6].\nThe top quark with a mass of the order of the electronweak scale, mt = 171.4 \u00b1\n1.2(stat.) \u00b1 1.8(syst.)GeV [7], is the heaviest particle yet discovered, which is singled out\nto play a key role in probing the new physics beyond the SM. Very large mass of top quark\nprompts itself to rapidly decay before hadronization and the spin information of the top\nquark is preserved from its decay. Thus, the top spin configuration can provide additional\nobservables for testing the SM and new physics beyond the SM. Spin correlation in top\nproduction and decay is a very interesting issue in top quark physics.\nIt is well known that, at the high energy linear e\u2212 e+ collider (ILC) experiments, the\ntop quark pair (tt\u0304) is produced in a unique spin configuration and the decay products\nof polarized top quark are strongly correlated to the spin axis. Thus, studying the tt\u0304\n2\n\n\fspin correlations provides an interesting possibility to test the SM and search for new\nphysics. This fact has made that the spin correlation of the tt\u0304 production at the ILC\nexperiments has been extensively studied in the SM and new physics beyond the SM\n[8,9,10]. This paper is aimed at investigating the effects of the non-universal neutral\ngauge boson Z \u2032 predicted by the topcolor scenario on the top quark pair production via\nthe process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 tt\u0304, and seeing whether the possible signatures of Z \u2032 can be detected\nvia measuring the tt\u0304 spin correlation observable in the future ILC experiments.\nThe T C2 model is one of the phenomenologically viable models, which has almost all\nessential features of the topcolor scenario. So, in the rest of this paper, we will give our\nnumerical results in detail in the context of the T C2 model. In the next section, we will\ngive the calculation formula including the contributions of the non-universal gauge boson\nZ \u2032 in the general spin basis. The corrections of Z \u2032 to the tt\u0304 production cross sections for\ndifferent spin configurations in the off-diagonal basis are calculated in section III. The\ncontributions of Z \u2032 to the tt\u0304 spin correlation coefficient C is discussed in section IV. Our\nconclusions are given in section V.\nII.The relevant formula of the tt\u0304 production in the general spin basis\nAs it is well known, a large part of the top quark mass is dynamically generated by\ntopcolor interaction at a scale of order 1 T eV in the T C2 model. To ensure that the\ntop quark condenses and receives a large mass while the bottom quark does not, a nonuniversal extended hypercharge group Uy (1) is introduced, so the T C2 model predicts\nthe existence of the extra Uy (1) gauge boson Z \u2032 , which couples preferentially to the third\ngeneration fermions. Thus, the new particle Z \u2032 should be easily detected via the processes\ninvolving the third generation fermions. The couplings of Z \u2032 to ordinary fermions which\nare related our calculation can be written as [3,11]:\n1 1\ng1 [ cot\u03b8\u2032 Z\u03bc\u2032 (t \u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc tL + 2t \u0304R \u03b3 \u03bc tR ) + tan\u03b8\u2032 Z\u03bc\u2032 (e \u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc eL + 2e \u0304R \u03b3 \u03bc eR )],\n2 3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g1 is the ordinary hypercharge gauge coupling constant, \u03b8\u2032 is mixing angle with\ntan\u03b8\u2032 =\n\n\u221a g1 .\n4\u03c0k1\n\nTo obtain the top quark condensation without forming a bb\u0304 condensation,\n\nthere must be k1 \u2264 1 [5]. In our numerical estimation, we will assume that the value of\n3\n\n\fk1 is in the range of 0.1 \u223c 0.9.\nTop quark pairs will be abundantly produced via the s-channel photon exchange and Z\nexchange at the ILC experiments. The gauge boson Z \u2032 predicted by topcolor scenario can\ngive additional contributions to top quark pair production. In this paper, we will discuss\nZ \u2032 effects on the spin configurations of the top quark pair production in the general spin\nbasis. In this basis, the spin states of the top quark and top anti-quark are defined in their\n \u0304\nown rest-frame by decomposing their spins along reference axes \u0100 and \u00c2.

For example, Ref.[12] has shown that, to fit the electroweak\nprecision measurement data, the Z \u2032 mass MZ \u2032 must be larger than 1 T eV . The lower\nbounds on MZ \u2032 can also be obtained from dijet and dilepton production at the Tevatron\nexperiments [13], or from B B\u0304 mixing [14]. However, these bounds are significantly weaker\nthan those from precisely electroweak data. Furthermore, Refs.[5,15] have shown that, for\nthe coupling parameter k1 < 1, the Z \u2032 mass MZ \u2032 can be explored up to several T eV at\n\u221a\nthe ILC experiment with S = 500GeV and the integrated luminosity \u00a3int = 100f b\u22121 .\nAs numerical estimation, we will take MZ \u2032 as a free parameter and assume that MZ \u2032 is\nin the range of 1T eV \u223c 2T eV throughout this paper. In this case, the total decay width\n5\n\n\f\u0393Z \u2032 is dominated by tt\u0304 and bb\u0304 modes, which can be approximately written as [16]:\n\u0393\n\nZ\u2032\n\ng1 cot2 \u03b8\u2032\n1\n\u2243\nMZ \u2032 = k1 MZ \u2032\n12\u03c0\n3\n\n(12)\n\nIn the following sections, we will use above equations to discuss the contributions of Z \u2032\nto different spin configurations and the spin correlation observable for the tt\u0304 production\nat the ILC experiments.\nIII.

Since the production cross\nsections for off-diagonal spin states (t \u2191 t\u0304 \u2193 and t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2191) are non-zero, thus it is called the\noff-diagonal basis. From Eq.(2) and Eq.(4), we can see that, in the SM, the expressions\n6\n\n\fof the angles \u03beL and \u03beR corresponding the off-diagonal basis are taken to be:\n\u2212AI\ncos\u03beI = q\n,\nA2I + BI2\n\n\u2212BI\nsin\u03beI = q\nA2I + BI2\n\n(13)\n\nwith\nSM\nSM\nAI = gII\n(cos\u03b8 + \u03b2) + gIJ\n(cos\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b2),\n\n(14)\n\nq\n\nSM\nSM\nBI = (gII\n+ gIJ\n)sin\u03b8 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 .\n\n(15)\n\n+\nObviously, there are two off-diagonal bases for tt\u0304 production, one is for e\u2212\nL eR scattering\n+\n\u2212 +\nand the other is for e\u2212\nR eL . However, for the process e e \u2192 tt\u0304, the two spin bases are\n+\nalmost identical. Thus, we will use the off-diagonal basis for e\u2212\nL eR scattering even when\n+\ndiscussing e\u2212\nR eL scattering in our numerical calculation.\n\n65\n\nM =1.0TeV\nZ'\n\n60\n\nM =1.5TeV\n\n55\n\nM =2.0TeV\n\nZ'\n\nZ'\n\nR (t\n\n|\n\n45\n40\n\nt\n\n) (%)\n\n50\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\ncos\n\nFigure 2: Same as Fig.1 but for the relative correction parameter R(t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2191) .\nOne interesting feature of the off-diagonal basis is that, in the SM, the production\ncross sections \u03c3L (t \u2191 t\u0304 \u2193) and \u03c3R (t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2191) are dominant for the production cross sections \u03c3L\n7\n\n\f+\n\u2212 +\nof the process e\u2212\nL eR \u2192 tt\u0304 and \u03c3R of the process eR eL \u2192 tt\u0304, respectively.

Thus, their values are insensitive to the free parameter k1 . We have taken k1 = 0.6 in\nFig.1 and Fig.2. From these figures, one can see that the values of the relative correction\nparameters decrease as MZ \u2032 increasing and cos\u03b8 increasing.

In Fig.3, we plot the production cross\n\u221a\nsection \u03c3 of this process as a function of MZ \u2032 for S = 500GeV and k1 = 0.6. One\n\ncan see from Fig.3 that, for 1T eV \u2264 MZ \u2032 \u2264 2T eV , the value of \u03c3 is in the range of\n1.07f b \u223c 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22122f b. If we assume that the yearly integrated luminosity of the ILC\n\u221a\nexperiment with S = 500GeV is \u00a3int = 340f b\u22121 [18], then there will be several tens\nof the raw events of the like-spin top quark pairs to be generated per year. Certainly,\nthe degrees of electron and positron polarization and the detecting efficiency for the final\nstate particles are generally smaller than 100%, the number of observable events is smaller\nthan the number of the raw events.\nTo see the effects of the c.m. energy\n\n\u221a\n\nS on the production cross section \u03c3 for the\n\u221a\nlike-spin states, \u03c3 is shown in Fig.4 as a function of S for different values of MZ \u2032 and k1 .\nOne can see from Fig.4 that the cross section resonance emerges when MZ \u2032 approaches the\n\u221a\nc.m. energy S. The resonance values of the cross section \u03c3 are strongly dependent on\nthe Z \u2032 mass MZ \u2032 and the coupling parameter k1 , which decrease as MZ \u2032 increasing and k1\nincreasing. For MZ \u2032 = 1.5T eV, k1 = 0.4 and 0.8, the maximum values of the production\ncross section \u03c3 can reach 228f b and 57f b, respectively. Thus, the resonance effects of the\ngauge boson Z \u2032 on the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 t \u2191 t\u0304 \u2191 +t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2193 might be observed in the future\nILC experiments.\nOf course, in practice, there are experimental issues to consider, that will dilute the\nsignal. We must take into account the fact that the colliding electron and positron will\nnot have 100% polarization. Moreover, there will also be a considerable dilution of the\nsignal associated with the efficiency of measuring the polarization of the top quarks.\nIV. The non-universal gauge boson Z \u2032 and the tt\u0304 spin correlation observable\nFrom above discussions we can see that, at the ILC, the top quark pair tt\u0304 can be\nproduced in an unique spin configuration. In the familiar helicity basis, all spin configurations have contributions to the production cross section of the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 tt\u0304. In\nthe off-diagonal basis, the contribution from the like-spin states (t \u2191 t\u0304 \u2191 and t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2193) to\n10\n\n\fthe SM process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 tt\u0304 at the tree-level is zero, while the contributions from the spin\n\n+\nstates t \u2191 t\u0304 \u2193 and t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2191 are dominant for the cross sections of the processes e\u2212\nL eR \u2192 tt\u0304 and\n+\ne\u2212\nR eL \u2192 tt\u0304, respectively.

In principle, the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 6 jets is very complex.\nHowever, since \u0393t \u226a mt , the narrow width approximation approach is valid for t and\nt\u0304 quarks. Using this method, it has been shown that the best way to analyze the tt\u0304\ncorrelation is through angular correlation among the two charged leptons l and l\u2032 in the\ndi-lepton final state [19]. To obtain the differential cross section of the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192\ntt\u0304 \u2192 b \u0304l\u03bdl b\u0304l\u2032 \u03bdl\u2032 , the production and decay spin density matrixes are written as the usual\n\napproach. After integrating over the azimuthal angles of the charged leptons, one can\nobtain the following double differential distribution [9]\n1\nd2 \u03c3\n1\n= (1 + B1 cos\u03b8l\u0304 + B2 cos\u03b8l\u2032 \u2212 Ccos\u03b8l\u0304 cos\u03b8l\u2032 ),\n\u03c3 dcos\u03b8l\u0304 dcos\u03b8l\u2032\n4\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03b8l\u0304 (\u03b8l\u2032 ) denotes the angle of the charged lepton  \u0304l (l\u2032 ) with respect to the chosen\nspin axis in the top quark (top antiquark) rest frame. The coefficients B1 (B2 ) and C are\nrelated to the mean t(t\u0304) polarization and spin correlation projected into the direction of\nthe spin axis. The spin correlation coefficient C can be written as:\nC = \u03b1l\u0304 \u03b1l\u2032 hst st\u0304 i,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03b1i is the spin analyzing power of particle i, which have opposite signs for the\ncharged leptons  \u0304l and l. At the leading order, there are \u03b1l\u0304 = \u2212\u03b1l = \u22121.\nThe contributions of the non-universal gauge boson Z \u2032 to the spin correlation coefficient C can be obtained by using the formula given in Sec.II. Our numerical results are\nC\ngiven in Fig.5, in which we plot the relative correction parameter Rc = C\u03b4SM\nas a function\n\u221a\nof the c.m. energy S for different values of the Z \u2032 mass MZ \u2032 and the coupling parameter\n\nk1 . From these figures one can see that, when the value of the Z \u2032 mass MZ \u2032 approaches\n\u221a\nthe c.m. energy S , the gauge boson Z \u2032 can generate significantly contributions to the\n\u221a\nobservable C. For example, for k1 = 0.6 and MZ \u2032 \u2243 S = 1.5T eV the value of the\nrelative correction parameter Rc can reach 12.5%. Obviously, when the Z \u2032 mass MZ \u2032 is\n12\n\n\fmuch smaller or larger than the c.m. energy\n\n\u221a\n\nS, the effects of the non-universal gauge\n\nboson Z \u2032 on the spin correlation coefficient C are very small, which can not be detected\nat the ILC experiments.\nV. Conclusions\nTop quark decays before it hadronizes and the spin information of the top quark is\nnot spoiled and directly reflect to the distributions of its decay products. Hence, we can\nutilize the top quark spin for disentangling different top quark interactions efficiently. The\nspin correlation in top quark production and decays is an interesting issue in top quark\nphysics.\nThe top quark pairs can be produced at large rates via the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 tt\u0304 in a clear\nenvironment at the ILC, which can be seen as an ideal tool to make precision measurement\nof the top quark properties. In the off-diagonal basis, the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 tt\u0304 induced by\nthe SM has two characteristic features. One is that the production cross sections for the\nlike-spin states vanish and the other is that the production cross section of the spin state\nt \u2191 t\u0304 \u2193 (t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2191) for the left-handed (right-handed) electron beam is dominant. The effects\nof the QCD corrections do not change these features. Thus, observation of sizable cross\nsection for the like-spin states and large corrections to the cross sections for the t \u2191 t\u0304 \u2193\nand t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2191 states can be seen as signals of new physics beyond the SM.\nIn this paper, we calculate the contributions of the non-universal gauge boson Z \u2032\npredicted by the T C2 model to the spin configurations of the top quark pair production\nvia the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 tt\u0304 in the off-diagonal basis. Our numerical results show that\nZ \u2032 exchange can generate significantly corrections to the differential cross sections for\nthe t \u2191 t\u0304 \u2193 and t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2191 states. For 1T eV \u2264 MZ \u2032 \u2264 2T eV and cos\u03b8 \u2264 0, the values\nof the relative correction parameters R(t \u2191 t\u0304 \u2193) and R(t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2191) are in the ranges of\n26% \u223c 2.3% and 64% \u223c 7.7%, respectively. The production cross section for the likespin state t \u2191 t\u0304 \u2191 +t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2193 is non zero induced by Z \u2032 exchange, which is in the range of\n\u221a\n1.07f b \u223c 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22122 f b for S = 500GeV , 0.2 \u2264 k1 \u2264 0.8, and 1T eV \u2264 MZ \u2032 \u2264 2T eV .\n\u221a\nFurthermore, when the Z \u2032 mass MZ \u2032 approaches the c.m. energy S, the cross section\n\u221a\nresonance emerges. For k1 = 0.2, MZ \u2032 \u2243 S = 1T eV and 1.5T eV , the resonance values\n13\n\n\fof the cross section \u03c3(t \u2191 t\u0304 \u2191 +t \u2193 t\u0304 \u2193) can reach 2586f b and 912.5f b , respectively.\nTo see whether the effects of Z \u2032 on the tt\u0304 production can be measured in the future\nILC experiments, we further calculate the contributions of Z \u2032 to the tt\u0304 spin correlation\ncoefficient C. We find that, with reasonable values of the free parameters MZ \u2032 and k1 , the\nvalue of the relative correction parameter Rc can be significantly large. Thus, we expect\nthat the effects of the new gauge boson Z \u2032 on the spin configurations of the tt\u0304 production\nand the tt\u0304 spin correlation coefficient C might be observed at the future ILC experiments.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by Program for New Century Excellent Talents in\nUniversity(NCET-04-0290), the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the\nGrants No.10475037 and 10675057.\n\n14\n\n\fReferences\n[1] For a review, see A.
