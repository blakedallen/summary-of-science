This factor\nsimply relates the cross section measured in the laboratory to the cross section in a stellar environment, \u03c3 \u2217 , by\n\u03c3 \u2217 \u2261 SEF \u00d7 \u03c3 lab . In capture reactions, this means that\nfor the determination of the SEF, an evaluation of the\ncapture cross section for nuclei in excited states needs\nto be done. In same cases the SEF is close to unity and\nthe effect on the stellar cross section is marginal. However, there are several important cases in which excited\nstates of the target nuclei are strongly populated in a stellar environment. There, an accurate determination of the\nSEF is mandatory. Just to mention one example in which\nthis is the case one can consider the SEF of the \u03c3n,\u03b3 of\nthe 186 Os and 187 Os. The latter, in particular, has an excited state at only 9.8 KeV excitation energy and at stellar\ntemperature of the order of kT \u2248 30 KeV can be populated up to 50 %. This implies a 20 % difference in the\nstellar Maxwellian averaged capture cross section ratio\nof 186 Os to 187 Os. In turn, if one uses the Re/Os clock\nfor the age determination of the galactic nucleosynthesis,\none obtains an increase of 2 Gyr in the age. It is therefore\nnecessary to obtain an accurate determination of the SEF.\nThis is usually done in model calculations based on the\nHauser-Feshbach statistical model theory (HFSM). Measurements of the capture cross sections for target nuclei\nin their ground-state allow for checking the accuracy of\nthe model calculations. However, an experimental determination of the SEF would strongly enhance the reliabil-\n\nity of the evaluated reaction rates in stellar environment.\nThe possibility to measure directly the cross section from\nnuclei in excited states is scarce if not completely null,\nbecause nuclei in excited states (which are not isomers)\nlive a marginal fraction of seconds. It is proposed here\nto use the inverse reaction channel of the neutron capture process to deduce the SEF for one important neutron capture cross section: the 151 Sm(n, \u03b3 ). This reaction\ncross section has been measured recently at the CERN\nn_TOF facility [1] as well as at the Forschungszentrum,\nKarlsruhe [2]. These measurements provide confidence\non the experimental determination of the Maxwellian averaged cross section (MACS) for the ground-state capture. On the other hand, the SEF for this reaction needs\nto be derived by theoretical calculation which may produce different results. The possibility of an experimental\ndetermination of the SEF seems therefore appealing.\n\n>\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n>\n\narXiv:nucl-th/0501082v1 31 Jan 2005\n\nA.

Schematic view of the neutron capture and dissociation processes\n\n\fDIRECT AND INVERSE REACTION\nCHANNELS\nThe time-reversal invariance of nuclear reactions which\nleads to the detailed-balance relation between reactions\nin the \"direct\" and \"inverse\" channels has been widely\nused for deriving reaction cross sections which can be\naccessed in the laboratory only in one of the time directions. A schematic view of the capture reaction process\nand its time-reversals invariant is shown in Figure 1. The\nrelation between the cross sections in the case of a neutron capture reaction process, n+A Z \u2192A+1 Z +\u03b3 , is simply given by\n\n\u03c3n,\u03b3 =\n\nk\u03b32 2JA+1 + 1\n\u03c3\u03b3 ,n\nkn2 2JA + 1\n\nwhere kn is the incident neutron wave number and k\u03b3 =\n\u03b5\u03b3 /h\u0304c is the \u03b3 -ray wave number related to the \u03b3 -ray transition energy \u03b5\u03b3 . The dissociation can be induced by real\nphotons, or by the virtual photon field generated by a\nhigh-Z target as in the Coulomb dissociation process.\nThe latter reaction process is nowadays widely used in\nexperiments with radioactive ion beams, in which also\nthe reaction kinematics is inverted (see for example [3]).\nOne important difference to notice between the two reaction processes is that, while in the capture channel, all\nthe states in the n+AZ composite system are populated,\nin the inverse dissociation process only the ground-state\nof the composite system is involved. Therefore, the timereversal invariance is fully symmetrical only for groundstate transitions. It is also important to note here that excited states in the residual nucleus can be populated by\nthe dissociation process. As will be shown in detail below, the proposal of the present work is based on this\nconsideration.\nOn the experimental side, (\u03b3 , n) reactions have been\nused recently for the determination of some capture reaction rates of unstable isotopes of branching points in the\ns process path, with two different techniques. An activation method based on a bremsstrahlung photon spectrum\nsuch as the one of the S-DALINAC at Darmstadt Technical University. In this case, a photon beam with different\nbremsstrahlung end-point energies is used to activate a\ntarget material whose decay is detected off-line after the\nirradiation. A second method is based on the use of laser\ninverse-Compton scattering gamma-ray sources. In this\ncase, a monochromatic gamma-ray beam is used to induce prompt photo-neutron (or photo-p, photo-\u03b1 , etc.)\nemission in the dissociation process. Both techniques are\ndescribed in a recent review paper [4] in which details\nof the methods used to derive the capture reaction rate\nfrom (\u03b3 , n) measurements are given. For both methods, a\nmodel calculation of the (\u03b3 , n) cross section is required.\nThe calculated cross section is then normalized to the\n\nexperimental data obtained for the ground-state transitions and then the same normalization factor is used in\nthe evaluation of the cross section for transitions to the\nother excited states.\n\nSEF: FROM THEORY TO EXPERIMENT\nThe 151 Sm(n, \u03b3 )152 Sm reaction has important implications in nuclear astrophysics as it can be used to constrain the temperature conditions of the He burning phase\nof AGB stars. With its 93 years \u03b2 -decay half-life, 151 Sm\nrepresents a branching point in the s process path which\nis influencing the isotopic abundance ratio of the two sonly Gd isotopes 152 Gd and 154 Gd. Since the \u03b2 -decay\nhalf-life of 151 Sm is temperature dependent, once that its\ncapture cross section is determined, a link between the\ntemperature conditions and the isotopic abundance ratio\nbetween the two Gd isotopes can be established.\nThe 151 Sm(n, \u03b3 )152 Sm cross section has been recently\nmeasured at the CERN n_TOF facility [1]. The result for\nthe MACS-30 (MACS at kT = 30 keV) is 3100 \u00b1 160\nmb. This result has been confirmed in a measurement\nperformed at FZK [2] in which the MACS-30 result obtained is 3031 \u00b1 68 mb. Theoretical estimates of the capture cross section based on HF statistical model theory\nproduces much lower values, typically around 2000 mb.\nIn any case, the energy dependence of the cross section\nis well reproduced by the model calculation and, once\nthat the MACS value is obtained in the laboratory, the\ncalculated cross section can be normalized.\n151 Sm has several low-lying levels which can be populated under stellar conditions. For example, the first excited state at 4.8 keV is populated at a 30 % level at\ntemperatures of kT = 30 KeV. The determination of the\nSEF for the 151 Sm(n, \u03b3 )152 Sm reaction is therefore important for a reliable application to AGB star modeling.\nA schematic view of the situation in reported in Figure 2.\n7/2\u2212\n\n8%\n\n3/2\u2212\n\n29%\n\n5/2\u2212\n\n51%\n\n151\n\nSm\n\nn\n\n8.257\n0.685\n\n0+\n\n0.366\n\n4+\n\n0.121\n\n2+\n\n0.0\n\n0+\n\n152 Sm\nFIGURE 2.

There is, however,\na peculiarity in this reaction. In fact, starting from the\nJ \u03c0 = 0+ ground-state of 152 Sm, only excited states in\n151 Sm can be populated by the strongest E1 transitions\nand with s-wave neutrons in the continuum. In particular, the J \u03c0 = 5/2\u2212 can only be populated with d-wave\nneutrons left in the continuum. The J \u03c0 = 3/2\u2212 first excited state at Ex = 4.82 KeV in 151 Sm is populated from\nthe neutron emission threshold and s-wave neutrons in\nthe continuum. The next possible excitation is the 5th\nexcited state at Ex = 104.8 KeV, also a J \u03c0 = 3/2\u2212 state.\nThis situation is schematically shown in Figure 3.\n\n8.4\n\nTHE 152 Sm(\u03b3 , n)151 Sm CASE\n\n-> 2nd\n-> 3rd\n-> 4th\n\n9\n\n9.2\n\nold. As expected, the only open channel up to \u2248 100\nKeV above threshold is the dissociation leading to the\n151 Sm(J \u03c0 = 3/2\u2212 ) state. Therefore, in an actual experiment, this would produce the information needed to derive the capture cross section of 151 Sm from its first excited state.\nAs the excitation energy increases, the second dissociation channel at Ex = 104.8 KeV opens up. Then, a\nmeasurement of the (\u03b3 , n) cross section above this energy\nrange would include the effect of this state and in turn,\nallow for an experimental determination of the timereversal neutron capture process from this state. Only at\nhigher excitation energies, the effect of the ground-state\nstarts to contribute, but only to a few percent level.\n\n8.6\n8.8\nGamma-ray energy [MeV]\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the SEF can be calculated. This is normally done with the use of the HauserFeshbach statistical model theory. The main ingredients\nin these calculations are the optical model parameters\nrepresenting the interaction of the neutron with the target,\nfurnishing the neutron transmission coefficients for the\nneutron-nucleus interaction. In addition, the representation of the density of nuclear states at excitation energies\nup to the neutron separation threshold and up to \u2248 1 MeV\nabove. Finally, the electric dipole resonance parameters\nare used to evaluate the \u03b3 -ray strength functions.\nThe NON-SMOKER calculation of the SEF for the\n151 Sm(n, \u03b3 )152 Sm reaction is 0.87 at kT = 30 KeV [5],\nwhile in the calculation performed for the present\nwork we have obtained 0.93. This discrepancy is most\nlikely due to different parameterizations of the HauserFeshbach theory which are used in model calculations.\nTherefore, the accuracy of the SEF calculation cannot\nguaranteed by the HFSM theory itself.\n\nFIGURE 4. HFSM calculation of the 152 Sm(\u03b3 , n)151 Sm\ncross section for dissociation into the different 151 Sm+n channels.\n\nThe HFSM calculations have been performed using\nthe nuclear level density parametrization of reference\n[6]. The parameters have been fixed to reproduce the\nexperimental level spacings at the neutron separation\nenergies which, in the present case, are available for\nboth the isotopes involved [7]. The Moldauer [8] optical\nmodel parameters have been used for the neutron transmission function calculations and experimental parameters of the Giant Dipole Resonance [9] for the calculation of the \u03b3 -ray strength function. The cross section has\nbeen renormalized in order to reproduce the measured\n151 Sm(n, \u03b3 )152 Sm MACS-30. This normalization factor\nturned out to be 1.7 for the present HFSM calculations\nas well as for the NON-SMOKER result [5].\nThe absolute value of the dissociation cross section\nis of the same order as that of measurements already\nperformed (see for example the report on the 186 W(\u03b3 , n)\nmeasurement [10]), making the proposal for an actual\nexperiment quite realistic.\n\n\fCONCLUSION\nThe experimental determination of the SEF for the\n151 Sm(n, \u03b3 ) could be possible by a measurement\nof the time-reversal invariant reaction process, the\n152 Sm(\u03b3 , n)151 Sm reaction. This reaction can only populate excited states in the 151 Sm+n residual channel for\nexcitation energies just above threshold. The technique\nhas been used for the determination of capture cross\nsections of unstable nuclei at s process branching points\nand could, in this specific case lead to the experimental\ndetermination of a SEF for the first time.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI would like to thank Franz K\u00e4ppeler for several fruitful\ndiscussions on the subject of the present work.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
