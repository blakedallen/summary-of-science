amenability.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAll the graphs in this paper will be assumed to be locally finite with at most a countable number of\nvertices. Given a (connected) graph \u0393, there exists two natural random subgraphs on \u0393 known as the\nFree Uniform Spanning Forest (FSF) and the Wired Uniform Spanning Forest (WSF) (see [BLPS]\nor [L1] for introductory material and more). They are defined as follows. Consider any increasing\nsequences \u0393i of finite connected subgraphs of \u0393 whose union is all of \u0393. Then, as shown in [Pe],\nthe uniform distribution on spanning trees on \u0393i converges and is, by definition the distribution of\nFSF. To obtain WSF, identify all of the boundary vertices of \u0393i to obtain a graph \u0393\u0303i . As proven\nin [Pe], the uniform distribution on spanning trees on \u0393\u0303i converges and the limiting distribution is\nthe distribution of WSF (by definition).\nIn [BLPS], it is shown that there exists a monotone coupling \u03bc of WSF and FSF (this follows\nfrom [FM]), i.e. \u03bc is a probability measure on 2E(\u0393) \u00d7 2E(\u0393) (where E(\u0393) denotes the edge set\nof \u0393) whose projection onto the first factor is the distribution of WSF, whose projection onto the\nsecond factor is the distribution of FSF, and such that \u03bc is concentrated on the set of all pair\n(T1 , T2 ) \u2208 2E(\u0393) \u00d7 2E(\u0393) such that T1 \u2282 T2 . The proof, however, is purely an existence proof. The\nauthors of [BLPS] posed the following problem: does there exist a natural or explicit monotone\ncoupling of WSF and FSF? In particular, does there exist an automorphism invariant coupling of\nWSF and FSF?\nWe show if \u0393 is a (connected, locally finite) graph and G < Aut(\u0393) is a residually amenable\ngroup of automorphisms of \u0393 then there exists a coupling of WSF and FSF that is invariant under\nelements of G. We note that all finitely generated linear groups are residually amenable. See section\n2 for more details on residual amenability.\n\u2217\n\nResearch supported in part by NSF Vigre Grant No. DMS-0135345\n\n1\n\n\fWe mention that for many graphs \u0393, WSF = FSF. This is true if and only if there are no\nnonconstant harmonic Dirichlet functions on \u0393 (see [BLPS]). In particular, WSF=FSF whenever \u0393\nis the Cayley graph of a cocompact lattice G in En (for all n) or in Hn (for n > 2). However, WSF\n6= FSF when G is a cocompact Fuchsian group.\n\n2\n\nBackground on residually amenable groups\n\nWe will use the following definition of amenable (see [Z]):\nA topological group G is amenable if and only if for every compact metrizable space Z such\nthat G acts on Z by homeomorphisms and the map G \u2192 Homeo(Z) is continuous, there exists a\nBorel probability measure \u03bc on Z that is invariant under the action of G. By invariant, we mean\nthat for all Borel sets E \u2282 Z and for all g \u2208 G, \u03bc(gE) = \u03bc(E). The topology on Homeo(Z) is\nthe compact open topology. We note that finite groups and finitely generated abelian groups are\namenable (given the discrete topology).\nIf P is a property of groups, then a topological group G is said to be residually P if for every\ng \u2208 G \u2212 {1}, there exists a surjective continuous homomorphism \u03c6 : G \u2192 H such that H has\nproperty P and \u03c6(g) is not the identity.\nWe need the following two results from [Z] Prop. 4.1.6. First, if G is amenable and H is a\nclosed subgroup of G, then H is amenable. Second, if K is a closed normal subgroup of G then\nG is amenable if and only if both K and G/K are amenable. Now suppose that K1 and K2\nare closed normal subgroups of G such that both G/K1 and G/K2 are amenable. We claim that\nG/(K1 \u2229 K2 ) is amenable. To see this, note that K1 /(K1 \u2229 K2 ) is a closed normal subgroup of\nG/(K1 \u2229 K2 ) and [G/(K1 \u2229 K2 )]/[K1 /(K1 \u2229 K2 )] is isomorphic to G/K1 which is amenable. Also\nK1 /(K1 \u2229 K2 ) maps injectively into G/K2 (under the quotient map) so it is amenable too (by the\nfirst result). The second result now implies G/(K1 \u2229 K2 ) is itself amenable. It follows easily that\nif G is separable (i.e. G contains a countable dense subset) then G is residually amenable if and\nonly if there exists a decreasing sequence of closed normal subgroups Gi in G such that G/Gi is\namenable and \u2229i Gi = {1}. The next lemma is presumably well-known but we did not find it in the\nliterature.\nLemma 2.1. If \u0393 is a locally finite graph (with at most a countable number of vertices) and G is\na group of automorphisms of \u0393 then G is separable (in the open-compact topology).\nProof. Let V denote the vertex set of \u0393. We let Br (v) denote the radius r neighborhood of a vertex\nv \u2208 V . Since \u0393 is locally finite, for every integer radius r > 0 and (v, w) \u2208 V \u00d7 V there are only\nfinitely many bijections from Br (v) to Br (w). So there exists a countable set S \u2282 G such that for\nany (v, w) \u2208 V \u00d7 V if there is a g \u2208 G such that g(v) = w then there exists a gr \u2208 S that agrees with\ng on the radius r neighborhood of v. In the open-compact topology gr converges to g as r \u2192 \u221e.\nSo S is dense in G.\nWe let Aut(\u0393) denote the full automorphism group of a graph \u0393.\nCorollary 2.2. If G < Aut(\u0393) is residually amenable then there exists a decreasing sequence {Gi }\nof closed normal subgroups of G such that G/Gi is amenable and \u2229i Gi = {1}.\n\n2\n\n\fWe note that since finite groups are amenable, any residually finite group is residually amenable.\nA well-known result due to Mal'cev [Ma] (or see theorem 2.7 [We]) states that if G is a finitely\ngenerated subgroup of GLn (C) then G is residually finite. In particular, all discrete groups of\nisometries of hyperbolic space are residually finite. It is an open problem whether or not all word\nhyperbolic groups are residually finite (see [KW]). Olshanskii has proved [O] that in a certain sense,\nalmost every finitely generated group is word hyperbolic. So, if all word hyperbolic groups are\nresidually finite then almost every (finitely generated) group is residually amenable.\nThere is an example, due to E.A. Scott [S] of a finitely generated infinite simple group that\nhas a free nonabelian subgroup. Such a group cannot be residually amenable. There are groups\nthat are residually amenable but not residually finite. For example, the Baumslag-Solitar group\nBS(2, 3) =< x, y | xy 2 x\u22121 = y 3 > is one.\n\n3\n\nBackground on Determinantal Probability Measures\n\nLet E be any set (with at most countable cardinality), and S < l2 (E) be a closed subspace of\nl2 -summable functions on E. (In general, we write S < T to mean S is a closed subspace of T ).\nThere exists a natural probability measure PS on 2E defined by\nPS (B \u2282 B) = Det[< PS (\u03c7e ), \u03c7f >e,f \u2208B ].\n\n(1)\n\nPS is said to be a determinantal probability measure (see [L2] for the history and background\nof such measures). Here, B is a finite subset of E and PS (B \u2282 B) is by definition the probability\nwith respect to PS that B is contained in a random subset of \u0393, PS denotes projection onto S, \u03c7e\ndenotes the characteristic function of an element e \u2208 B. The right hand side is the determinant\nof the matrix with columns and rows indexed by elements of B whose (e, f )-entry is equal to the\nl2 -inner product < PS (\u03c7e ), \u03c7f >. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, it can be shown that this\ndetermines a probability measure. A determinantal probability measure is defined as one that arises\nfrom this construction (see [L2] for introductory material and more). We let GS denote a random\nsubset with distribution PS .\nIt is shown in [BLPS] that the distributions of WSF and FSF are determinantal. To be precise,\n2 (\u0393) be the space of l2 -summable antisymmetric functions f on the\nlet \u0393 be a graph. We let l\u2212\n(directed) edge set of \u0393. By antisymmetric we mean that if e is an edge of \u0393 and \u011b is equal to e\nwith the opposite orientation, then f (e) = \u2212f (\u011b). For any edge e of \u0393, let 1e be the characteristic\nfunction of e. We let \u03c7e = 1e \u2212 1\u011b be the unit flow along the (directed) edge e.\nFor any vertex v of \u0393, define the star of v is defined to be \u03a3e \u03c7e where the sum is over all directed\n2 (\u0393) generated by all stars of\nedges e with initial endpoint equal to v. We let \u22c6 be the space in l\u2212\nall vertices.\nWe say that (e1 , .., ek ) is a cycle of edges in \u0393, if the destination vertex of ei equals to the initial\n2 (\u0393) is a cycle. We let\nvertex of ei+1 for all i mod k. In this case, we say that the function \u03a3i \u03c7e \u2208 l\u2212\n2\n\u2666 be the subspace of l\u2212 (\u0393) generated by all cycles in \u0393. It is shown in [BLPS] that\n2\nl\u2212\n(\u0393) = \u22c6 \u2295 \u2666 \u2295 \u2207HD\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2207HD is the gradient of the space of all harmonic Dirichlet functions on \u0393. It is proven\nin [BLPS] that the distributions of WSF and FSF are the determinantal probability measures\n3\n\n\f~ is a set of directed edges\nassociated to \u22c6 and \u22c6 \u2295 \u2207HD = \u2666\u22a5 respectively. To be precise, if B\n~\n~\n~ but without orientation.\nsuch that if e \u2208 B then \u011b \u2208\n/ B then let B denote the same set of edges of B\nS\nThen we define P by\nPS (B \u2282 B) = Det[< PS (\u03c7e ), \u03c7f >e,f \u2208B~ ].\n\n(3)\n\n2 (\u0393). It follows from elementary properties of deteminants that this\nwhere S is a subspace of l\u2212\n~ It is shown in [BLPS] that P\u22c6 is the\nis well-defined (i.e. it is independent of the choice of B).\n\u22a5\ndistribution of WSF and P\u2666 is the distribution of FSF. For our purposes, it suffices to assume this\nas the definition of the distributions of WSF and FSF. One easily deduces that WSF=FSF if and\nonly if \u2207HD = 0. This occurs, for example when \u0393 is the Cayley graph of an amenable group or\nof a Kazhdan group. See Bekka and Valette [BV] (Theorem D) for a more complete list of groups\nwhose Cayley graphs satisfy \u2207HD = 0.\n2 (\u0393) and S and T are\nWe will need the following facts from [L2] (Theorem 5.2). If S < T < l\u2212\nE(\u0393)\nclosed then for any increasing event A \u2282 2\n(A is increasing whenever A \u2208 A and A \u2282 B \u2282 E(\u0393)\nimplies B \u2208 A) PS (A) \u2264 PT (A). By Strassen's theorem [St], this implies the existence of a\nmonotone coupling between PS and PT .\n\n4\n\nthe theorem\n\nIn this section we state and prove the main theorem.\nTheorem 4.1. If \u0393 is a connected locally finite graph (with at most a countable number of vertices)\nand G < Aut(\u0393) is residually amenable (with respect to the compact-open topology) then there exists\na G-invariant monotone coupling between the WSF and the FSF on \u0393.\nSince G is residually amenable and separable, there exists a decreasing sequence {Gi } of closed\nnormal subgroups of G such that G/Gi is amenable for all i and \u2229i Gi = {1}.\nWe let \u0393/Gi be the quotient graph. Its vertices (edges) are equivalence classes of vertices (edges)\nin \u0393 where v is equivalent to w if there is a g \u2208 Gi such that gv = w. If [v] and [w] are vertices\nof \u0393/Gi , then there is an edge between them for every equivalence class [e] of edges such that one\n2 (\u0393/G ). We let \u22c6 be the subspace\nendpoint of e is in [v] and the other is in [w]. Consider l\u2212\ni\ni\ngenerated by all the stars of \u0393/Gi and \u2666i be the subspace generated by all the cycles of \u0393/Gi . We\nlet \u2207HDi denote the gradient of the Harmonic Dirichlet functions on \u0393/Gi . So,\n2\nl\u2212\n(\u0393/Gi ) = \u22c6i \u2295 \u2666i \u2295 \u2207HDi .\n\n(4)\n\n2 (\u0393/G ). Then c = \u03a3n \u03c7ei\nLet \u03c0i : \u0393 \u2192 \u0393/Gi denote the quotient map. Suppose c is a cycle in l\u2212\ni\ni=1\nwhere e1 , e2 , .., en is a sequence of directed edges such that the terminal vertex of ei is equal to the\ninitial vertex of ei+1 (mod n). We will say that c is a true cycle if every directed component of\n\u03c0i\u22121 ({e1 , .., en }) forms a (finite) cycle in \u0393. We let Ci denote the closed subspace of \u2666i spanned by\nall the true cycles and let Hi denote its orthocomplement in \u2666i . Now we have\n2\nl\u2212\n(\u0393/Gi ) = \u22c6i \u2295 Ci \u2295 Hi \u2295 \u2207HDi .\n\n4\n\n(5)\n\n\fNow let Wi be the random subgraph of \u0393/Gi associated to \u22c6i . Let Fi be the random subgraph\nassociated to \u22c6i \u2295 Hi \u2295 \u2207HDi = Ci\u22a5 .\nThe strategy of the proof is as follows. We show that in a certain sense, a lift of Wi converges to\nWSF and a lift of Fi converges to FSF. Using the amenability of G/Gi , we can average any coupling\nof Wi and Fi over G/Gi to obtain a G/Gi -invariant coupling. By a compactness argument, a limit\npoint of the sequence of lifted couplings exists and we will show that any limit point is a G-invariant\nmonotone coupling of WSF and FSF.\nWe need to introduce some topological spaces. First, we let Z = 2E(\u0393) be the space of subgraphs\nof \u0393. It is compact in the product topology. The group G acts on Z in the natural way and this\naction is bi-continuous. We let MZ denote the set of Borel probability measures on Z and MZi\ndenote the subset of MZ of measures that are G-invariant. By invariance we mean if \u03bc \u2208 MZi ,\nE \u2282 Z and g \u2208 G then \u03bc(gE) = \u03bc(E). We say that a sequence {\u03bci } in MZ converges to \u03bc in the\nweak* topology if\nZ\nZ\nf d\u03bc\n(6)\nf d\u03bci \u2192\nZ\n\nZ\n\nfor every continuous function f : Z \u2192 C. It follows from standard functional analysis that both\nMZ and MZi are compact under the weak* topology. Note that for every finite subset B \u2282 E(\u0393),\nthe function fB : Z \u2192 C defined by fB (z) = 1 if B \u2282 z and fB (z) = 0 otherwise is continuous. It\nis not hard to show that if\nZ\nZ\nfB d\u03bc\n(7)\nfB d\u03bci \u2192\nZ\n\nZ\n\nfor every finite set B \u2282 E(\u0393) then \u03bci converges to \u03bc in the weak* topology. In this case, if Gi is\na random subgraph with distribution \u03bci and G is a random subgraph with distribution \u03bc then we\ni\nwill say that Gi converges to G (weak*). Similarly, we define MZ\u00d7Z\nto be the space of G-invariant\nBorel probablity measures on Z \u00d7 Z. It is compact under the weak* topology.\n2 (\u0393), we will say that P\nIf {Si } is a sequence of closed subspaces in l\u2212\nSi \u2192 PS in the strong\n2\noperator topology (SOT) if for every f \u2208 l\u2212 (\u0393), ||PSi (f ) \u2212 PS (f )|| \u2192 0. We sometimes express this\n2 (\u0393) is compact under the\nby writing Si \u2192 S (SOT). It can be shown that the set of subspaces of l\u2212\nS\nS\ni\nSOT. Note that if PSi \u2192 PS (SOT) then P \u2192 P in the weak* topology. It is well known that if\n2 (\u0393) are closed subspaces and S \u0580 S (meaning that S \u2282 S\nSi < l\u2212\ni\ni\ni+1 and \u222aSi is dense in S) then\n2\nPSi (T ) \u2192 PS (T ) (SOT) for any closed subspace T (in l\u2212 (\u0393)).\n2 (\u0393/G ), let P\u0303S be the distribution of the random subgraph \u03c0 \u22121 (G ). For ease of\nIf S < l\u2212\ni\nS\ni\nnotation, we also denote \u03c0i\u22121 (Wi ) by W\u0303i and \u03c0i\u22121 (Fi ) by F\u0303i . We will show that W\u0303i \u2192 WSF and\nF\u0303i \u2192 FSF. In order to do this, we introduce sequences of random subgraphs of \u0393 that equal W\u0303i or F\u0303i\non fundamental domains of Gi and have the advantage that their distributions are determinantal.\nFor this we let Di be a connected subgraph of \u0393 such that the covering map \u03c0i restricted to the\nedge set of Di is bijective. Also assume that Di \u2282 Di+1 and that \u222ai Di = \u0393. This is possible since\n\u2229i Gi = {1}.\nIf GS is a random subgraph of \u0393/Gi , let G\u02c6S be the random subgraph of \u0393 that is contained in\n2 (D ) \u2192\nDi and is equal to G \u0303S on Di . Note that \u03c0i restricted to Di induces an isomorphism \u03c0i\u2217 : l\u2212\ni\n\u22121\n2\n2\nl\u2212 (\u0393/Gi ). If S < l\u2212 (\u0393/Gi ) is a (closed) subspace, let \u015c denote \u03c0i\u2217 (S). It is easy to check that \u011cS\nis the random subgraph associated to \u015c (i.e. \u011cS = G\u015c ).\n5\n\n\fLemma 4.2. Suppose for each i, Gi is a random subgraph on \u0393/Gi . Then G\u0303i \u2192 G (weak*) if and\nonly if \u011ci \u2192 G (weak*).\nProof. Let B be a finite set of edges of \u0393. Suppose that G\u0303i \u2192 G (weak*). Then, by definition of\nweak* convergence,\nZ\nZ\nfB d\u03bc\n(8)\nfB d\u03bc\u0303i \u2192\nZ\n\nZ\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0303i is the distribution of G\u0303i and \u03bc is the distribution of G. There exists an N such that i > N\nimplies that B \u2282 Di . Since \u011ci is equal to G\u0303i on Di , it follows that\nZ\nZ\nfB d\u03bc\n(9)\nfB d\u03bc\u0302i \u2192\nZ\n\nZ\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0302i is the distribution of \u011ci . Since B is arbitrary, \u011ci \u2192 G (weak*). The proof in the other\ndirection is similar.\nTheorem 4.3. W\u0303i \u2192 WSF and F\u0303i \u2192 FSF (weak*).\nProof.

By definition gv \u2208 \u22c6j . It is clear that fv = \u03c0j\u2217\n(gv ). So PS (fv ) = PS (\u03c0j\u2217\n(gv ))\n\u02c6\nwhich implies that PS (fv ) \u2208 PS (\u22c6j ). Since v is arbitrary, the claim is proven.\n\u02c6 j ) < PS (\u22c6) for j large enough we follow the same argument as above in\nTo show that PS (\u22c6\n\u02c6 j ) = PS (\u22c6) for all j large enough. Similarly, it can be shown that PS (\u0108j ) = PS (\u2666)\nreverse. So, PS (\u22c6\nfor all j large enough.\n2 (\u0393) so\nWe let Si be the subspace generated by the functions \u03c7e for e \u2208 Di . Then Si \u0580 l\u2212\n\u02c6 j ) for j large enough, we have that for any subsequential\nPSi (\u22c6) \u2192 \u22c6 (SOT). Since PSi (\u22c6) = PSi (\u22c6\n\u02c6 j }, PS (T ) \u2192 \u22c6 (SOT). But PS (T ) \u2192 T (SOT) so T = \u22c6, i.e. \u22c6\n\u02c6 j \u2192 \u22c6 (SOT).\nlimit T for {\u22c6\ni\ni\nThis implies that \u0174i \u2192 WSF (weak*).\nSimilarly, it can be shown that \u0108i \u2192 \u2666 (SOT). This implies that (\u0108i )\u22a5 \u2192 \u2666\u22a5 (SOT). Since\nc\u22a5 . Hence we have\nS \u0580 l2 (\u0393), it follows that P ((\u0108 )\u22a5 ) \u2192 \u2666\u22a5 .

This implies that F\u0302i \u2192 FSF (weak*) since Ci is the distribution of F\u0302i . Now\nwe are done.\nProof. ( of theorem 4.1)\nBy Strassen's lemma and [L2] Theorem 6.1, for all i, there exists a monotone coupling of Wi\nand Fi . The space Ci of all such monotone couplings is compact under the weak* topology. G/Gi\n\n6\n\n\facts on this space by gGi \u03bc(F ) \u2192 \u03bc(gGi F ) for \u03bc \u2208 Ci and F \u2282 2E(\u0393/Gi ) \u00d7 2E(\u0393/Gi ) . Since G/Gi is\namenable there exists a G/Gi -invariant measure \u03c3i on Ci . Let \u03bci be defined by\nZ\n\u03bci (F ) =\n\u03bd(F ) d\u03c3i (d\u03bd)\n(10)\nCi\n\nfor any Borel set F \u2282 2E(\u0393/Gi ) . Because \u03c3i is G/Gi -invariant, \u03bci is a G/Gi -invariant monotone\ncoupling of Wi and Fi .\nSince \u03c0i : \u0393 \u2192 \u0393/Gi is equivariant with respect to the G-action, and \u03bci is invariant under G/Gi ,\nwe may pull \u03bci back via \u03c0i to a G-invariant monotone coupling \u03bc\u0303i between W\u0303i and F\u0303i .\ni\nThe space of G-invariant monotone couplings is naturally a closed subspace of MZ\u00d7Z\n. This\nspace is compact, so there exists a weak* limit point \u03bc of \u03bc\u0303i . Since \u03bci \u2192 \u03bc, the first and second\nmarginals of \u03bci must converge to the first and second marginals of \u03bc respectively. Thus \u03bc is a\ncoupling between WSF and FSF.\n\n5\n\nspeculations\n1. Suppose that \u0393 is a planar graph embedded in the hyperbolic plane so that Aut(\u0393) acts by\nhyperbolic isometries. We may then take G = Aut(\u0393) and choose Gi so that G/Gi is finite. It\ncan be shown that the distribution of Fi is the uniform distribution on subgraphs G of \u0393/Gi\nsuch that G contains a spanning tree and H2 /Gi \u2212 G is a topological disk. If there exists\na \"natural\" or explicit coupling between Wi and Fi then one may hope to obtain a natural\ncoupling between WSF and FSF as a limit of lifts of couplings of Wi and Fi . It seems that it\nshould be possible to find such a coupling (if it exists) if only because \u0393/Gi is a finite graph.\n2 (\u0393). Does there exist G/G -invariant subspaces\n2. Suppose that S is a G-invariant subspace of l\u2212\ni\n2 (\u0393/G ) such that \u015c \u2192 S?\nSi in l\u2212\ni\ni\n\nAcknowledgements I am grateful to Henry Cohn, Scott Sheffield, Russell Lyons and Yuval\nPeres for valuable conversations.\n\nReferences\n[BLPS] I.
