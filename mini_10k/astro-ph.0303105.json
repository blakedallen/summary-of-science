There are three main kinds of compact\nobjects, namely, white dwarf, neutron star and black hole. Also in last decade, the\npossibility of the strange compact star contained by the quark matter, has been proposed.\nIf the compact object is a companion of a binary system or situated at the centre of any\ngalaxy (if the compact object is black hole), the accretion disk forms around it. Shakura &\nSunyaev (1973) started this discussion theoretically, proposing a model of accretion disk,\nnamely Keplerian accretion disk model. Further, Novikov & Thorne (1973) and Page &\nThorne (1974) analysed accretion disk in a general relativistic treatment. Paczy\u0144ski &\nWiita (1980), for first time, proposed a method namely pseudo-Newtonian and prescribed\nthe corresponding pseudo-Newtonian potential to describe the accretion disk around\nSchwarzschild (non-rotating) black holes. In this method, the basic equations of the disk\nare chosen as non-relativistic and the gravitational force and corresponding potential\nare adjusted in such a manner, that could approximately describe relativistic properties\nof the accretion disk around compact objects. Using that pseudo-Newtonian potential\nfor non-rotating compact, Abramowicz & Zurek (1981) studied some transonic aspects\nof accretion phenomena. However, as no cosmic object is static, the pseudo-Newtonian\npotential proposed by Paczy\u0144ski & Wiita (1980, hereinafter PW potential) is oversimplified,\nparticularly for inner region of the accretion disk. Thus other pseudo-Newtonian potentials\nhave been proposed incorporating the rotation of the compact object by Artemova et\nal. (1996), Mukhopadhyay (2002a), Mukhopadhyay & Misra (2003), Mukhopadhyay &\nGhosh (2003) and Ghosh (2003). The interesting fact lies in the methodology adopted by\nMukhopadhyay (2002a) to describe a potential for the accretion disk, which can be used to\nderive the pseudo-potential for any metric according to the physics concerned.\nOut of several works on accretion phenomena present in literature, mostly are discussed\nfor black holes (e.g., Abramowicz et al. 1988, 1996; Abramowicz & Kato 1989; Chakrabarti\n1990, 1996a,b,c; Narayan & Yi 1994; Narayan et al. 1997, 1998; Kato et al. 1998; Sponholz\n& Molteni 1994; Peitz & Appl 1997; Gammie & Popham 1998; Popham & Gammie 1998;\nMiwa et al. 1998; Lu & Yuan 1998; Manmoto 2000; Mukhopadhyay 2003) and a few are for\nneutron stars (Chakrabarti & Sahu 1997; Mukhopadhyay 2000, 2002b; Popham & Sunyaev\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2001; Prasanna & Mukhopadhyay 2003; Mukhopadhyay & Ghosh 2003). These studies\nhave been made either in a full general relativistic frame-work or in a pseudo-Newtonian\napproach. There are a number of basic differences between the accretion disk around black\nhole and any other gravitating objects namely neutron star, white dwarf, strange star and\nother highly gravitating star, particularly at the inner edge of the disk. (1) While the black\nhole has event horizon, other gravitating objects mentioned above have hard surface. Thus,\nwhereas in the case of other gravitating object close to the surface the matter speed must\nbe subsonic, for black holes the matter speed is supersonic. (2) In case of other gravitating\nobject that has hard surface, the matter comes into contact with its outer surface. Thus,\nthere is an obvious effect of dragging to the exterior space-time due to its rotation. In terms\nof general relativity, corresponding space-time metric should be the solution for interior\nas well as exterior to it. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the 'dragging effect' of\nrotating gravitating star (particularly for neutron star, where the relativistic effect is very\nimportant) to the space-time. In case of black hole, which does not have hard surface, this\neffect comes to the space-time automatically through the 'Lense-Thirring drag' from the\nKerr geometry which does not describe any physics interior to the horizon. (3) Further, the\noverall temperature as well as the luminosity of the disk is expected to be high in the cases\nof other gravitating star particularly for neutron star with respect to that of black hole\n(Mukhopadhyay 2000, 2002b; Mukhopadhyay & Ghosh 2003) for a particular accretion rate.\nIf the same parameters are chosen for the infalling matter towards black hole and other\ngravitating objects separately, at a particular accretion rate, the maximum temperature\nin the disk around black hole will be lower at least a few factors times. Thus, in the disk\naround a neutron star, expected generation/absorption of nuclear energy is higher than that\naround a black hole. As the radius of white dwarf is very large, the general relativity is not\nmuch important in the accretion disk around it. But my discussions will be generally true\nfor disk around black hole and any other kind of gravitating object having hard surface,\nnamely neutron star, white dwarf, strange star and other gravitating star.\nMukhopadhyay (2002b) has studied the fluid behaviour of accretion disk around\nnon-rotating neutron star with the negligible magnetic effect compared to the viscous effect\nin the disk. It was found that the temperature of the inner disk around neutron star is\nsignificantly higher than the case of black holes. Prasanna & Mukhopadhyay (2003) have\nshown that the rotational effect of compact object (particularly other than black hole) to\nthe accretion disk can be approximately reproduced with the use of Coriolis effect. They\nhave done perturbative analysis and shown that the self-similar solutions are well behaved\nfor most of the parameter space. Moreover, the recent observation tells about the evidence\nof millisecond pulser (Strohmayer & Markwardt 2002) of frequency 582Hz for 4U 1636-53\nwhich is the accreting Low-Mass-X-ray-Binary (in short LMXB). Therefore, it is important\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nto consider properly the rotational effect of the neutron star and strange star to the disk.\nApart from that, it is established fact that the inner edge properties of accretion disk\naround black hole strongly depend on the angular momentum of black hole (e.g., Gammie\n& Popham 1998; Popham & Gammie 1998; Mukhopadhyay 2003).\nIn this paper, I shall study the accretion phenomena in pseudo-Newtonian manner\nmainly following potentials given by Mukhopadhyay (2002, hereinafter Mukhopadhyay\npotential), Mukhopadhyay & Misra (2003, hereinafter MM potential) and Mukhopadhyay &\nGhosh (2003, hereinafter MG potential). As using those pseudo-potentials, I shall study the\nrelativistic properties of accretion disk (using simple non-relativistic set of fluid equations),\nI name this study as pseudo-general-relativistic. Moreover, I will study the viscous accretion\nphenomena for entire physical parameter region and comment on the stability of the disk.\nI also will analyse globally the behaviour of the sonic points, formation of shock and show\ninstead of several differences, the accretion disk around black holes and neutron stars, both\ncan be studied in an equal footing and all of their properties belong to an unified class.\nRecently, Mukhopadhyay et al. (2003) prescribed a theoretical model to achieve the QPO\nfrequency for LMXB for rotating compact object and showed their theoretical prediction of\nfrequency matches fairly well with that of observation. As my main interest is to study the\ninner region of the accretion disk, I shall concentrate upon the sub-Keplerian flow, where\nthe effect of rotation of compact object is significant.\nIn the next section, I will present the basic equations needed to describe the accretion\ndisk. In \u00a73, I will discuss about the parameter space of accretion disk and how does the\nrotation of compact object affect it. Subsequently, in \u00a74, I will describe the fluid dynamical\nresults. Finally, in \u00a75, I will sum up all the results and make the overall conclusions.\n2.\n\nBasic model equations of accretion disk\n\nIn the calculations, throughout I express the radial coordinate in unit of GM/c2 , where\nM is mass of the compact object, G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light.\nI also express the velocity in unit of speed of light and the specific angular momentum in\nunit of GM/c. The equations to be solved are given below.\n(1) Equation of continuity:\n1 d\n(x\u03a3v) = 0\nx dx\nor \u1e40 = \u22124\u03c0x\u03a3v,\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nwhere \u03a3 is the vertically integrated density and \u1e40 is the accretion rate. Following\nMatsumoto et al. (1984), I can calculate \u03a3 as\n\u03a3 = In \u03c1e h(x),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1e is the density at equatorial plane, h(x) is the half-thickness of the disk and\n(2n n!)2\nIn = (2n+1)!\n, where n is the polytropic index.

On\n\n(15)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nthe other hand, for neutron star matter speed may or may not attain supersonic speed\nthroughout its path in the accretion disk, but very close to the compact object, matter\nspeed must be subsonic as star has hard surface (Mukhopadhyay 2002b). Thus although at\nfar away from the compact object, v < cs , close to it, for black hole always and for neutron\nstars in some cases, v > cs . Therefore, in that situation, there must be an intermediate\nlocation, where the denominator of (13) must be vanished. To have a smooth solution, at\nthat location, numerator has to be zero. This location is called the sonic point or critical\npoint (xc ). The existence of sonic location plays an important role in accretion phenomena.\nSonic point is the main factor behind the formation of shock in accretion disk. From the\nglobal study of the sonic points in an accretion disk, one can understand about the stability\nof physical parameter region. However, in the cases around neutron star where matter does\nnot attain supersonic speed at all, sonic point does not come into the picture of stability\ncriterion.\nNow, when the sonic point exists in an accretion disk around compact object,\nf2 (vc , csc ) = 0 at x = xc . Thus at that location Mach number can be written as\n\u221a\nB + B2 \u2212 4AC\n2\nMc =\n,\n(16)\n2A\nwhere\nA = \u03b12 \u03b3f (\u03933 \u2212 1) + \u03b3(\u03931 + 1) \u2212\n\n4\u03b12 f (\u03933 \u2212 1)\u03b3 2\n,\n3\u03b3 \u2212 1\n\n4\u03b12 \u03b3f (\u03933 \u2212 1)\nIn+1\nB = 2\u03931 \u2212\n1\u2212\n,\n3\u03b3 \u2212 1\nIn\n2\u03b12f (\u03933 \u2212 1) In+1\n.\nC =\n3\u03b3 \u2212 1\nIn\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(17)\n\nSubsequently, at x = xc , f1 (xc , vc , csc ) = 0. Thus, using (16) I can eliminate vc from\nf1 (xc , vc , csc ) = 0 and get an algebraic equation for csc and xc , which I can solve to find out\ndv\nsound speed at sonic location. To find out dx\n|c , I apply l'Hospital's rule to (13). In order to\nunderstand the fluid properties in accretion disk, I have to solve (13) with an appropriate\nboundary condition. Also, integrating (10), I get the angular momentum of the accreting\nmatter as\n\u03b1xc2s\n\u03bb=\nv\n\n!\n\n2\n+ M 2 + \u03bbin ,\n3\u03b3 \u2212 1\n\n(18)\n\nwhere M is the Mach number of the flow and \u03bbin is the angular momentum at the inner\nedge of accretion disk.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nNow from (1) and integrating (4), I can write down the entropy and energy of the flow\nat sonic point as\n\u03b3\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \u03b3\u22121\n\u03bb2\n\u2212\nF\n3\nc\nxc\n\u22121/2\n\uf8f8\n(19)\n\u1e40c = x3/2\n(\u03b3 + 1)q/2 \uf8ed 1 dF\nc Fc\n3\n|\n\u2212\nc\nFc dx\nxc\nand\n\n\uf8eb\n\nR\n\n2\n\n\u03bbc\n2\u03b3 \uf8ed x3c \u2212 Fc \uf8f8\n\u03bb2c\n,\nEc =\n+\nV\n+\nc\nc\n(\u03b3 \u2212 1) F1c dF\n2x2c\n| \u2212 x3c\ndx c\n\nwhere Vc = ( F dx)|c and q =\n\n(\u03b3+1)\n.\n2(\u03b3\u22121)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(20)\n\nIt can be mentioned that, disk entropy and accretion\n\nrate are related by a simple relation as \u1e40 = (\u03b3K)n \u1e40. While \u1e40 is a conserved quantity\nfor the particular accretion flow, \u1e40 is not, as it contains K n which carries the entropy\ninformation that is not conserved in a dissipative system. As a boundary condition for the\nparticular flow, I have to supply the sonic energy, Ec , and angular momentum, \u03bbc . Then\nfrom (20), I can find out the sonic location xc . Therefore, knowing xc one can easily find out\nthe fluid velocity and sound speed at the sonic point from f1 = f2 = 0 with the help of (16)\nfor a particular accretion flow. These have to be supplied as further boundary conditions of\nthe flow.\n\n2.1.\n\nSonic points in accretion disk\n\nEquation (20) is a quartic equation of xc whose solution gives four roots, namely, sonic\nlocations, of which either all are real or two real and two complex or all are complex. In a\nparticular flow, if real roots at all exist, then at first it should be checked whether or not its\nlocation is inside the black hole horizon (x+ ) or stellar surface (xR ). The pseudo-potentials\nfor the disk around non-rotating compact object are finite for x > 2. Thus the inner edge\nof the disk can be extended upto x = 2 for Schwarzschild geometry. However, the radius\nof neutron star can be extended even upto x \u223c 6 (at least theoretically). If the root,\nxc > x+ , xR , sonic transition may be possible for that flow. If there are two real physical\nroots, two possible sonic transitions may exist. On the other hand if the roots are complex,\nthere is no solution of accretion flow for that particular parameter region having sonic point.\n\u221a\ndv\n|c is the form of Q + Q2 \u2212 4PR and\nNow from (13), it can be checked that numerator of dx\nI get the discriminant as D = Q2 \u2212 4PR which determines the nature of sonic points (also\nsee Chakrabarti 1990). For any physical sonic transition D > 0, where for C > 0, C = 0\nand C < 0, the sonic points are 'nodal', 'straight line' and saddle ('X')-type respectively.\nWhen D = 0, the sonic point is 'inflected nodal type' and for D < 0, it is 'spiral type'\nif B =\n6 0 and 'O(centre)-type' if B = 0. Thus, there are two main kinds of sonic points\ndepending on D is positive or negative, as D = 0 ('inflected nodal type' sonic point) is a\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nspecial case of D \u2265 0. All the sonic points for D \u2265 0 are the distorted version of 'X'-type\nsonic point and for D < 0 are basically the deviation of 'O'-type sonic point. If there are\ntwo saddle-type ('X'-type) sonic points in a particular accretion disk, those form on either\nside of an 'O'-type sonic point. If the saddle-type sonic point forms at an inner radius than\nthat of 'O'-type sonic point, it is called the inner-sonic point and if it forms at an outer\nradius, called outer-sonic point. The detailed discussions on the definition and nature of\nvarious critical points are given in Thompson & Stewart (1986).\n\n2.2.\n\nShock in accretion disk\n\nNow let me come to the issue of the formation of shock. Mukhopadhyay (2002b)\nshowed that in accretion disk around neutron star, double shock is very natural in certain\nphysical situations. The shock wave may form in an accretion flow only when there are\nthree critical/sonic points exist (Chakrabarti 1989, 1996b). First, inflowing matter attains\na supersonic speed at an outer sonic point then it jumps from that outer sonic branch to\ninner sonic point branch by means of a shock as the inner sonic branch has higher entropy,\nthen passing through the inner sonic point it attains supersonic speed again. After that, if\nthe compact object is a black hole, it falls into it. Otherwise, if it is a neutron star, another\nshock forms close to the stellar surface and being subsonic matter, it falls onto the surface\nof the neutron star. There are three kinds of shock, namely, Rankine-Hugoniot shock,\nisentropic shock and isothermal shock (Landau & Lifshitz 1987; Chakrabarti 1990). In case\nof Rankine-Hugoniot shock, the energy is radiated away through the shock surface and\nradiative cooling is inefficient. Here, E+ = E\u2212 , \u1e40+ > \u1e40\u2212 and T+ > T\u2212 . For isentropic\nshock, the energy is lost at the shock but the generation of entropy is comparable to the\nentropy radiated away keeping entropy conserved at the shock. Here, E+ < E\u2212 , \u1e40+ = \u1e40\u2212\nand T+ > T\u2212 . In the formation of isothermal shock the radiative cooling is very efficient and\nsome energy and entropy are lost at the shock location keeping unchanged the temperature.\nHere, E+ < E\u2212 , \u1e40+ < \u1e40\u2212 and T+ = T\u2212 . Whatever be the nature of shock, the mass and\nmomentum flux at the shock location are always conserved. Thus, at shock location\n\u1e40+ = \u1e40\u2212 ,\n\np\u0304+ + \u03c1\u0304+ u2+ = p\u0304\u2212 + \u03c1\u0304\u2212 u2\u2212 ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere, '+' and '-' signs denote the quantities after and before the shock respectively and\np\u0304 and \u03c1\u0304 denote some kind of averaged pressure and density respectively as the flow is\nconsidered in vertical equilibrium but with finite thickness.\nHowever, in my discussion, whenever I mention the shock, will mean Rankine-Hugoniot\nshock. If I write down the conditions to form a shock in an accretion disk (Chakrabarti\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n1989) for rotating compact object, these are\n1 2 2\n1\nM+ cs+ + nc2s+ = M\u22122 c2s\u2212 + nc2s\u2212 ,\n2\n2\nc\u03bds+\n\u1e40+\n\nc\u03bd\n2\u03b3\n+ \u03b3M+2 = s\u2212\n3\u03b3 \u2212 1\n\u1e40\u2212\n!\n\nwhere\n\nC=\n\n2\nM+\n\n!\n\n2\u03b3\n+ \u03b3M\u22122 ,\n3\u03b3 \u2212 1\n\n(23)\n\n\u1e40+ > \u1e40\u2212 ,\n\n(24)\n\nx3/2\ns\n\u221a\n\u1e40 = Mc2(n+1)\n.\ns\nFs\n\n(25)\n\nHere, xs indicates the shock location and \u03bd =\ninvariant quantity as\n\u0010\n\n(22)\n\n+ (3\u03b3 \u2212 1)M+\n\nM+2 (\u03b3 \u2212 1) + 2\n\n\u00112\n\n3\u03b3\u22121\n.\n\u03b3\u22121\n\n=\n\n\u0010\n\nAlso from (23) and (25), I get the shock\n\n2\nM\u2212\n\n+ (3\u03b3 \u2212 1)M\u2212\n\nM\u22122 (\u03b3 \u2212 1) + 2\n\n\u00112\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nwhich remains unchanged with respect to a non-rotating case. If only all the conditions,\n(22)-(24) and (26) are simultaneously satisfied by the matter, shock will be generated in an\naccretion disk.\n\n3.\n\nDescription of the disk parameter space\n\nI will show here, how does the rotation of compact object and viscous dissipation of\nthe accreting fluid affect the disk parameter region known for non-rotating compact object\n(according to Schwarzschild geometry). Therefore, I have to analyse globally the viscous\naccretion disk properties around rotating black holes and neutron stars. Actually, I have\nto check, how do the angular momentum of compact object and viscosity of the disk fluid\naffect the sonic location, structure, as well as the stability of disk. Also the magnetic\nfield effect in the disk is considered to be negligible compared to the viscous effect. I\nwill consider the rotation of black hole to be high as J = \u00b10.9, while '+' and '-' are for\nco-rotation and counter-rotation respectively. As it is known that 4U 1636-53 is one of\nthe fast rotating compact object other than black hole whose specific angular momentum\nis J = 0.2877, in my example for neutron star or compact object other than black hole,\nI consider the rotation to be J = \u00b10.3. I also will compare the results with non-rotating\ncases. Along with inviscid case, I also will consider the viscous fluid with Shakura-Sunyaev\n(1973) viscosity parameter (\u03b1) chosen to be 0.4 and 0.8. When \u03b1 = 0.4, the heat lost is\nconsidered intermediate, as if half amount of the total viscous heat generated in the disk is\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nlost and thus cooling factor is chosen to be f = 0.5. For \u03b1 = 0.8, the heat lost is considered\nto be negligible as the residence time of the fluid in the disk is very small. Thus the cooling\nfactor is considered as f = 1.\n\n3.1.\n\nAnalysis for black hole\n\nFigures 1-3 are showing all the above mentioned effects in the disk around black\nhole. In Fig. 1a, I show the variation of disk entropy as a function of sonic location. The\nintersections of all the curves by the horizontal line (which is a constant entropy line)\nindicate the sonic points of the accretion disk for a particular entropy, viscosity of the\ndisk and rotation of the black hole. It is clearly seen that, at a particular entropy, if the\nco-rotation of black hole increases, marginally bound (xb ) and stable (xs ) orbits as well as\nsonic points shift to a more inner region and the possibility to have all four sonic points in\nthe disk outside the horizon increases. On the other hand, if the black hole counter-rotates,\nxb and xs move to greater radii and all the sonic points come close to each other for the\nsame entropy. It is clearly seen from Figs. 1a-c that as the black is chosen to be rotating\n(J = \u00b10.9), all the four sonic points appear outside to horizon, while for a non-rotating\nblack hole only three of them are appeared. Now, if the viscosity of the accreting fluid\nincreases keeping entropy unchanged, the possibility to have all sonic points for a particular\nangular momentum of the black hole decreases. In Fig. 1b, it is seen that as \u03b1 increases\nfrom 0 to 0.4, for the counter-rotating black hole (here, J = \u22120.9), outer saddle- and\ncentre-type sonic points have disappeared completely (as there is no intersection). Figure 1c\nshows, for a higher viscosity (\u03b1 = 0.8), even for co-rotating and no-rotating black hole, the\nouter saddle- and centre-type sonic points have disappeared. Similar features are reflected\nfrom Fig. 2, where the sonic energy is plotted as a function of sonic location. Here also,\nthe intersections of the horizontal line (which indicates a constant energy line) by all the\ncurves indicate the sonic points of the accretion disk for a particular energy, viscosity of the\nfluid and rotation of the black hole. For both the Figs. 1 and 2, sonic points with negative\nslope of the curve indicate the locations of 'saddle-type' sonic point and positive slopes\nindicate the 'centre-type' sonic point. Thus the rotation of black hole and viscosity of the\naccreting fluid play the important roles to the formation and location of sonic points which\nare related to the structure of accretion disk.\nFigure 3 indicates the variation of energy with entropy at sonic locations, when J\nis parameter for different viscosity of the fluid. Here, 'I' and 'O' indicate the inner and\nouter sonic point branch respectively. It is seen that, with the increase of co-rotation (for\nexample, here J = 0.9), inner sonic point branch of the disk extends upto a lower entropy\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Variation of sonic entropy as a function of sonic location in accretion disk around\nblack hole for various values of Kerr parameters, J, when (a) \u03b1 = 0, f = 0, (b) \u03b1 = 0.4,\nf = 0.5, (c) \u03b1 = 0.8, f = 1. The solid curve indicates non-rotating case (J = 0), while the\ndotted and dashed curves are for co-rotating (J = 0.9) and counter-rotating (J = \u22120.9) black\nhole respectively. The horizontal line indicates the curve of constant entropy of 7.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\u03bb = 3.3, \u03b3 = 4/3 for all the curves.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Same as 1, except the sonic energy is plotted in place of sonic entropy. The\nhorizontal line indicates the curve of constant energy of 0.007.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nregion keeping the outer sonic points unchanged and the disk becomes unstable. I know\nthat the shock in accretion disk can be formed, only if there is a possibility of matter in the\nouter sonic point branch of lower entropy to jump to the inner sonic point branch of higher\nentropy. As because, with the increase of J, inner sonic point branch itself shifts to the\nlower entropy region which is comparatively unstable, the shock as well as disk also become\nunstable. Also with non-zero J, the inner and outer sonic point branches appear in such a\nmanner that there is no possibility of transition of matter from outer to inner sonic point\nbranch which increases entropy of the system. Clearly, for a highly rotating black hole,\nthe possibility of formation of shock reduces as well as the shock becomes unstable, as the\ninner sonic point branch itself is unstable. The physical reason behind it is that, with the\nincrease of value of J, the angular momentum of the system increases, which helps the disk\nto maintain a high azimuthal speed of matter upto very close to the black hole horizon, as a\nresult the radial speed of the matter can overcome the corresponding sound speed at a very\ninner radius only. On the other hand, the inner edge of the accretion disk is comparatively\nless stable, as the entropy decreases at lower radii. As the sonic points form at a more inner\nradii, with the increase of J, disk tends to an unstable situation.\nIn case of the counter-rotation of black hole, as J increases in magnitude, the inner\nsonic point branch shifts towards a higher entropy region and the entire system shifts\ntowards the outer side which is more stable. Also I-branch merges or tends to merge to\nthe O-branch and the possibility of shock decreases again. The physical reason to have a\nmore stable inner sonic point branch for the counter-rotating case is the following. As the\ncounter rotation of central object increases, the angular momentum of the system reduces,\nand the matter becomes more free to fall radially towards black hole at a larger radii\nand thus becomes supersonic at a comparatively outer edge of the disk. Thus, the disk\nbecomes more stable. As in case of higher counter-rotation, the angular momentum of the\nsystem becomes very small, the corresponding centrifugal pressure onto the matter becomes\ninsignificant, as a result the possibility of shock diminishes. Thus, if the angular momentum\nof black hole increases or decreases significantly, the shock wave in accretion disk becomes\nunstable and the disk itself tends to an unstable situation. Also for high J, there is another\ncentre-type sonic point branch appears outside the horizon which is seen at the right side\nof the I-branch (dotted and dashed curves) in Fig. 3.\nAs the viscosity of flow increases, the possibility of intersection between inner and\nouter sonic point branch decreases. With the increase of viscosity, more regions containing\nthe X-type sonic points become O-type (this feature is very prominent in Fig. 3c). The\nouter X-type sonic points recedes in further out and inner one proceeds in further inwards.\nThus the overall possibility of the formation of shock reduces significantly.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Variation of sonic energy as a function of sonic entropy in accretion disk around\nblack hole for various values of J when (a) \u03b1 = 0, f = 0, (b) \u03b1 = 0.4, f = 0.5, (c)\n\u03b1 = 0.8, f = 1.

Thus the parameter space need not be same as of the disk around\nblack hole at the inner edge. In Figs. 4 and 5, I show the variation of sonic entropy and\nenergy respectively as a function of sonic location. Figures 4a and 5a clearly show, while\nfor non-rotating compact object three sonic points exist, for a rotating case the number of\nsonic point may four. However, as the fourth sonic point forms at a radius x < 2.6 (see,\nFigs. 4 and 5), which is often inside the stellar surface, practically even for rotation only\nthree sonic points will form in the accretion disk. In Figs. 4b,c and 5b,c, I show how the\nlocations of sonic point shift with the increase of viscosity of the accreting fluid. Figures 4c\nand 5c indicates that for \u03b1 = 0.8, practically the disk has only (physical, saddle-type) sonic\npoint, namely inner one for any J. Other qualitative features are same as that of black hole.\nIn Fig. 6, I show the variation of sonic energy as a function of sonic entropy of the disk,\nwhen J is parameter for different viscosity of the fluid. Different features and corresponding\nphysical reasons are similar to that of black hole. For J = 0.3, the inner sonic point branch\ndisappears totally and only outer X-type and O-type sonic point branches remain. Clearly,\nfor a (highly) rotating compact object, the possibility of formation of shock reduces as well\nas the shock becomes unstable, as the inner sonic point branch itself disappears or tends to\ndisappear. In case of inviscid flow (Fig. 6a), for counter-rotating compact object, inner and\nouter X-type (saddle type) sonic point branches merge each other. However, for viscous\nfluid, although those are not merging but their clear distinction getting disappeared or\nseemed to disappear and the branch of O-type sonic point tends to convert to a part of\nX-type branch. Overall, with the increase of viscosity all the sonic point branches tend to\nmerge to a single branch which results a single sonic point for a particular accretion flow.\n\n4.\n\nFluid Properties of Accretion Disk\n\nI will now discuss the effect of rotation of compact object on the disk fluid. My\nintention will be to see the change of fluid properties known for the non-rotating case. I will\nconsider the cases of inviscid as well as viscous fluid. I will separately consider the accretion\ndisk around black holes and neutron stars (or strange stars) and thus the corresponding\npseudo-Newtonian potentials [Eqs. (6) and (7)] and will discuss both the cases in an unified\nscheme.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Variation of sonic entropy as a function of sonic location in accretion disk around\nneutron star for various values of angular momentum, J, when (a) \u03b1 = 0, f = 0, (b) \u03b1 = 0.4,\nf = 0.5, (c) \u03b1 = 0.8, f = 1.

I will mainly\nconsider the inviscid accreting fluid in the disk.\nFigure 7a shows the variation of Mach number for a particular set of physical\nparameter. If the black hole is chosen to be non-rotating, shock forms in the disk. When\nthe rotation of black hole is considered keeping other parameters unchanged, the solution\nchanges and shock disappears. If the black hole co-rotates, the inner-edge of disk becomes\nunstable and the matter does not find any physical path to fall steadily into the black hole.\nOn the other hand, if the black hole counter-rotates, there is a single sonic point in the\ndisk and the matter attains a supersonic speed only close to the black hole and falls into it.\nThus, for the non-rotating and counter-rotating cases, there are smooth solutions of matter\npassing through the inner sonic point, while for the co-rotating cases, it is not so. The\nphysical reasons behind these phenomena can be explained as follows. When the black hole\nco-rotates, the angular momentum of system increases, the radial speed of matter may not\nbe able to overcome the centrifugal barrier to fall into the black hole for that parameter set.\nIf the black hole counter-rotates, the angular momentum of system reduces, the centrifugal\nbarrier smears out and matter falls steadily into the black hole. It can be mentioned here\nthat, for the other choice of physical parameters (e.g. reducing/increasing the angular\nmomentum of accreting matter for co/counter-rotation, changing the sonic locations etc.)\nthe shock may appear again, even for the rotating black holes (a few of such examples are\n6\ndepicted in Fig. 8). Figure 7b shows the corresponding density profiles in unit of G3cM 2 for a\nparticular accretion rate. As the matter slows down abruptly, the density of disk fluid jumps\nup at the shock location for a non-rotating case. For the counter-rotating black holes, the\nangular momentum of the system is less, thus, to overcome the centrifugal barrier, matter\ndoes not need to attain a high radial speed away from the black hole. In this situation, the\nradial matter speed is less and the corresponding density of accreting fluid is high compared\nto a non-rotating case. I also show the density profiles for co-rotating, unstable cases. In\nFig. 7c, I compare the corresponding virial temperature profiles in the disk in unit of 109\n(T9 ). The variation of temperature is similar to that of density away from the black hole but\nis opposite when close to the horizon (as the density varies inversely with the temperature\nat a small x but not so at a large x, see Eqn. (1)). As the higher counter-rotation Mach\nnumber lowers down, the temperature of accretion disk becomes higher.\nFigure 8 gives examples where the shock forms in an accretion disk around rotating\nblack hole. The variation of Mach number for different Kerr parameters is shown in Fig.\n8a. It reflects that, for a small rotation of black hole (J = 0.1), matter adjusts the sonic\nlocations in such a manner that the outer (xo ) and inner (xi ) sonic locations shift in a\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Variation of (a) Mach no., (b) density and (c) temperature in unit of 109 as a\nfunction of radial coordinate around black holes of J = 0 (solid curve), J = 0.1 (dotted\ncurve), J = 0.5 (dashed curve), J = \u22120.1 (long-dashed curve) and J = \u22120.5 (dot-dashed\ncurve).

For the counter-rotating case (J = \u22120.1), xo may remain\nunchanged, but xi has to be shifted outside to form a shock at x = 17.25 (that keeps the\nshock location (almost) unchanged). As for the counter rotating cases, marginally stable\n(xs ) and marginally bound (xb ) orbits shift away from the black hole with respect to a\nco-rotating one, xi also shifts outside to stabilize the disk. If the co-rotation of black hole\nis higher, say J = 0.5, to form a stable shock, not only the inner sonic location has to be\nsmaller, the disk angular momentum (\u03bb) should also be reduced. High rotation of a black\nhole results in the location of horizon (x+ ) as well as xb and xs to shift inwards, and the\nmatter attains a supersonic speed at a point in more inside of the inner edge of the disk to\nfall into the black hole. Thus all the phenomena, like, sonic transitions, shock formations,\netc., shift inside. Moreover, for the stable solution, the angular momentum of the system\ncan not be very high, otherwise matter will be unable to overcome the centrifugal barrier.\nThus, for the high rotation of a black hole, like J = 0.5, \u03bb has to be reduced to form a\nshock (at x = 9.51) and stabilize the disk. However, for J = \u22120.5 and more negative, there\nis no sub-Keplerian flow for which a shock may form. For the higher counter-rotation of\na black hole, the angular momentum of system reduces. Since a higher centrifugal barrier\nis essential to form a shock, at the higher counter-rotation, shock completely disappears\nin the accretion disk. Figures 8b and 8c show the corresponding variations of density and\nvirial temperature respectively.\nIn Fig. 9, I show the fluid properties for J = \u00b10.998. At a very high rotation of black\nhole, the possibility to form a shock in accretion disk totally disappears. For the co-rotating\ncase, the disk cannot be stable unless the angular momentum of accreting matter is very\nlow (as I have already mentioned that the high angular momentum of the system makes\nthe disk unstable). Therefore, there is no scope to form a shock, as to its formation, matter\nneeds a significant centrifugal barrier as well as a high angular momentum of the accreting\nfluid. Here disk angular momentum chosen to be, \u03bb = 1.8 and the matter falls almost freely.\nFor the counter-rotating case, the matter angular momentum need not be low to stabilize\nthe disk. However, in the sub-Keplerian accretion disk, \u03bb cannot attain a high value to\nincrease the angular momentum as well as the centrifugal barrier of a system to form a\nshock. Thus, the shock disappears for a high counter-rotating case also. Figure 9a shows\nthat xb and xs shift outwards for the retrograde orbit and the matter attains a supersonic\nspeed at an outer radius than the case of a direct orbit in the disk. However, far away from\nblack hole, the radial velocity is less (as it needs to overcome a little centrifugal barrier)\nthan that of co-rotating case. Figure 9b shows the variation of corresponding density. Less\nvelocity implies a high rate of piling up of matter at a particular radius that produces a high\ndensity in the disk and thus the density behaves in an opposite manner to Mach number.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Variation of (a) Mach no., (b) density and (c) virial temperature in unit of 109 as\na function of radial coordinate around black holes for the sets of parameters (i) J = 0.998,\nxi = 5.6, \u03bb = 1.8 (solid curve) and (ii) J = \u22120.998, xi = 5.6, \u03bb = 3.3 (dotted curve). Other\nparameters are M = 10M\u2299 , \u1e40 = 1 Eddington rate, \u03b3 = 4/3.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nFigure 9c shows the variation of virial temperature in accretion disk. The temperature is\nlow for the co-rotation and high for the counter-rotation. The physical reason behind it is\nas follows. For a co-rotation, the net speed as well as the kinetic energy of matter is less,\nproducing less temperature. On the other hand, for a counter-rotating case, the situation\nis opposite. Although I show the virial temperature of the disk, in reality several cooling\nprocesses may take place that can reduce the disk temperature upto a few factors.\n\n4.2.\n\nAround Neutron Stars\n\nNow I will discuss the behaviour of viscous accreting fluid around rotating neutron star\nor strange star considering the effect of magnetic field in the disk is negligible. Similar to\nthe case of disk around black holes, here it will be investigated that how the various fluid\ndynamical behaviour of an accretion disk are affected for various choice of J and \u03b1. For a\ncertain physical parameter set, if the existence of sonic radii are possible in the accretion\ndisk, the flow structures can be studied for that choice of sonic radii (or energy) of the\naccretion flow.\nIn Fig. 10a, I show the variation of Mach number for three different values of J at a\nparticular viscosity. As the viscosity is low, the rate of energy momentum transfer in matter\nis less. It is known that for an accretion around neutron star, in a certain cases, matter\nmay be always subsonic (Chakrabarti & Sahu 1997; Mukhopadhyay 2002b; Mukhopadhyay\n& Ghosh 2003) and at the stellar surface matter speed reduces to zero. Owing to this fact,\nhere such a situation is considered where the speed of the accreting fluid is low, which\naccounts for the high residence time of matter in the disk. The angular momentum of the\ndisk is high at x \u223c 10 (see Fig. 10d) and thus radial matter speed is low. Subsequently,\nthough the disk angular momentum goes down, as the matter comes closer to the stellar\nsurface, it starts to decelerate and the radial matter speed still remains low. This results\nto a higher the possibility of cooling, and thus cooling factor f is chosen as 0.1. As\nthe energy momentum transfer rate in matter is low, the accretion rate is chosen to be\nintermediate. I have chosen a standard mass of compact star as 2M\u2299 . If the star is chosen\nto be non-rotating, angular momentum of the system is less and the centrifugal barrier is\nminimum. With the increase of J, this centrifugal barrier increases, and it becomes very\nhigh particularly for J = 0.5. Mach number profiles clearly indicate that at the surface\nof compact star, accreting fluid stops. Also from Fig. 10b and 10c, it comes out that\nsudden deceleration of the accreting fluid gives rise to a sudden enhancement of density and\ntemperature close to stellar surface. Here, the temperature is thought to be cooled down\nby a factor of 1/30 through the inverse-Compton effect in the radiation pressure dominated\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nrelativistic flow. Thus, I choose \u03b2 \u223c 0.03. Nevertheless, the temperature is still very high.\n6\nThe density profiles are plotted in unit of G3cM 2 .\nFigure 4d shows the ratio of sub-Keplerian to Keplerian angular momentum variation\nof the accreting fluid as a function of radial coordinate. It is seen that, at the boundary\nbetween Keplerian and sub-Keplerian disk, \u03bbk /\u03bb \u2192 1, and from that radius (xK ) I start my\ncalculation as my discussion is for sub-Keplerian accretion disk. From the \u03bbk /\u03bb profile, it is\nagain clear that for higher J, centrifugal barrier becomes stronger. Far away from compact\nstar, the effect of centrifugal barrier is weak, but as the matter approaches towards the\ncompact object, it starts to dominate and at x \u223c 10 it becomes stronger. Then again it\ngoes off. However, at very close to the stellar surface, again this centrifugal effect comes\ninto the picture as the matter falls into the strong rotational field of compact object. This\neffect appears very prominently for high value of J, which is chosen to be 0.5. Actually,\nthis effect comes into the picture, once the matter enters into the corresponding ergosphere\nof HT geometry. But the important point to be noted that if the outer radius of compact\nobject is greater than the radius of ergosphere, this feature does not have scope to take\nplace.\nIn Fig. 11, I show the results of accretion phenomena around one of the fast rotating\ncompact object, namely 4U 1636-53, whose angular momentum, J = 0.2877. The examples\nare shown, where the sonic point(s) exist in the flow and shock forms in the accretion disk\naround 4U 1636-53 for different viscosity parameters. Figure 11a shows the variation of\nMach numbers as a function of radial coordinate. It reflects that, for a small \u03b1 (\u223c 0) only\nshock is possible in the accretion disk. As \u03b1 increases, the energy momentum transfer rate\nincreases, rate of infalling the matter enhances and velocity of the accreting fluid becomes\nhigh at the inner edge of the disk. But, because of the inner hard surface, matter has\nto stop at close to stellar surface and naturally another shock forms at the inner edge of\nthe accretion disk. The shock locations for \u03b1 = 0.02 and 0.05, are at x = 14.27, 4.38 and\nx = 15.37, 4.31 respectively. If the viscosity is high, the cooling factor is intermediate (see\nFig. 5 caption). Also, the angular momentum of matter at the sonic point is chosen to\nbe, \u03bbc = 3, and for the radiation dominated, inverse-Comptonised flow, \u03b2 is chosen to be\n0.03. Figures 11b and 11c show the variations of density and temperature respectively. The\nregions, where velocity decelerates abruptly, temperature and density also jumps up in a\nsignificant manner. Here also, the inverse-Comptonised temperature is very high as the\ncases of Fig. 10.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Variation of (a) Mach number, (b) density, (c) temperature in unit of 109 , (d)\nratio of sub-Keplerian to Keplerian angular momentum of the accreting fluid around neutron\nstars as a function of radial coordinate.

In this respect viscous\naccreting fluid is chosen and central black holes and neutron stars are chosen to be\nnon-rotating or in the limit of weak rotation.\nFigure 12(a) shows the cases where the accreting fluid around neutron stars always\nstays in the subsonic branch, while around black hole (for \u03b1 = 0.001) it must be supersonic\nfor the same parameter set. As \u03b1 decreases, outer edge of the sub-Keplerian disk, xK ,\nincreases, as well as residence time of the matter in the disk increases. As \u03b1 decreases,\nenergy momentum transfer rate also decreases, as well as the corresponding Mach number\nand the centrifugal force decrease. Thus with the increase of \u03b1, incoming matter attains\nmore speed as well as more centrifugal force in the outward direction.\nIn Fig. 12(b), situations are considered in such a manner that close to the surface of\nthe neutron star shock forms, while for black hole no such shock is possible to form. This\ncase is slightly unstable as matter attains a supersonic speed at far away from the compact\nobject and continues to fall supersonically from x \u223c 100 to just before the shock in the\ninner region of the disk. Usually in stable cases, shock forms at a much greater radius as\nis shown in Fig. 12(c). Here, no shock forms at the outer radius and matter smoothly\nfalls supersonically. If the neutron star is there at the centre, in the very inner region,\nmatter satisfies the Rankine-Hugoniot shock conditions and jumps discontinuously from the\nsupersonic to the subsonic branch and falls on to the surface of neutron star, while for the\ncase of central black hole matter continues its supersonic motion and falls into the black\nhole.\nIn Fig. 12(c), the parameters are considered in such a manner that the shock forms\ntwice in the flow around the neutron star, while for black hole a single shock is possible\nfor a particular physical parameter set. At first the matter satisfies the Rankine-Hugoniot\nshock conditions at an outer radius irrespective of the nature of central compact object.\nThe formation of shock around black hole and neutron star at this location are similar.\nSubsequently, passing through the inner sonic point matter around black hole and neutron\nstar again attains a supersonic speed. Now the formation of another shock depends on the\nnature of compact object. If it is a black hole there is no question of the second shock as\nthe speed of the matter must be supersonic close to the horizon. On the other hand, if\nthere is a neutron star, without having another shock matter can not reach the surface of\nthe star in this present situation. This second shock occurs exactly in a similar way as the\nshock in Fig. 12(b), if the corresponding Rankine-Hugoniot shock conditions are satisfied.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- Variation of Mach number, M, as a function of logarithmic radial distance when\n(a) solid curves are for neutron star and dotted one is for accretion around black hole; (b)\nsolid and long dashed curves are for neutron star, dotted curve is for accretion around black\nhole; (c) solid (\u03b1 = 0.07, f = 0.1) and long-dashed (\u03b1 = 0.05, f = 0.5) curves are for neutron\nstar and dotted (stable case) and short-dashed (unstable case) curves (\u03b1 = 0.07, f = 0.1)\nare drawn for accretion around black hole. (d) Variation of temperature in unit of 109\nfor the 'cases of (c)' as a function of logarithmic radial distance. By NS and BH, I mean\nthe temperature distribution around neutron star and black hole respectively. The shock\nlocations are indicated as sck1 and sck2. Others parameter for all the cases are, mass of the\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\nIn Fig. 12(c) the shock locations are denoted by sck1 and sck2. I also show the Mach\nnumber variation for the noshock unstable case by short-dashed curve, if the matter with\n\u03b1 = 0.07 had fallen towards a black hole of mass 10M\u2299 . Thus, the formation of two shocks\ndepends upon the nature of the compact object and the possibility of satisfaction of shock\nconditions. For certain choices of the flow parameter values, even for a neutron star the\nRankine-Hugoniot shock conditions may not satisfy, though the matter attains a supersonic\nspeed. For these cases, the matter will not reach the neutron star. It should be reminded\nthat the inner shock location must be outside the radius of the neutron star. Here, as the\nradius of the shock location (\u223c 5.4 \u2212 5.6) is greater than the usual radius of a neutron star\nof mass 2M\u2299 (Cook et al. 1994; Dey et al. 1998), inner shock forms safely.\nFigure 12(d) shows the temperature variation in an accretion disk around the neutron\nstar and black hole for the cases shown in Fig. 12(c). Solid and long-dashed curves indicate\nthe temperature profiles around a neutron star (indicated as NS in the figure) when\nviscosities of the infalling matter are 0.07 and 0.05 respectively. At the shock locations (as\nindicated by sck1 and sck2 in figure) temperature rises discontinuously. By the dotted and\nshort-dashed curves I show the temperature variation of the inflowing matter of \u03b1 = 0.07\nwhen it falls towards a black hole of mass 10M\u2299 (as indicated BH in the figure). Dotted\ncurve is drawn for stable shock case and short-dashed curve is for unstable no-shock case\n(if the same matter had fallen without forming a shock). Although the virial temperature\nof accretion disk may be very high as of the order of 1011 K, following Mukhopadhyay &\nChakrabarti (2000) I have taken into account the various cooling processes so that the\ntemperature reduces to of the order of 109 K. As I consider the entire flow is relativistic,\ni.e., \u03b2 is very low (radiation pressure dominated flow), the soft photon in the disk is very\nprofuse. Thus, the temperature may be reduced by the inverse-Compton effect. As there is\nthe possibility of the formation of two shocks in the disk around a neutron star, temperature\nis still high enough. It is very clear from the above discussions that for the accretion around\na neutron star, temperature and density are higher compared to that around a black hole.\n\n5.\n\nSummary and Discussion\n\nI have studied the viscous accretion phenomena around rotating compact objects.\nThe corresponding accretion disks are modeled by means of Mukhopadhyay and MG\npseudo-Newtonian potentials in order to describe the relativistic properties around black\nholes and neutron stars (strange stars). As these potentials can describe all the essential\nrelativistic properties like, radius of marginally bound and stable orbit, specific mechanical\nenergy etc., of accretion disk within 10% error, I call the study as pseudo-general-relativistic,\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nwhere, along with these potentials, I have described the accretion disk using non-relativistic\nequations. I have prescribed the set of basic equations for vertically averaged, geometrically\nthin, viscous accretion disk and analysed the viscous parameter space globally. Subsequently,\nI have discussed the properties of viscous fluid and the effect of rotation of compact object\non the fluid behaviour. Examples are shown for the accretion disk around black holes\nas well as an observed LMXB candidate 4U 1636-53, which is one of the fast rotating\ncompact object with angular frequency 582Hz (equivalent J = 0.2877). I have treated the\naccretion disk around black holes and neutron stars in a same approach and compared their\nproperties. Just because of difference of inner boundary conditions, the accretion around a\nblack hole and a neutron star differ each other at the inner edge of the disk.\nAs no cosmic object is static, one of my aim was to study the structure and stability\nof the accretion disk around rotating compact object and how does the rotation play an\nimportant role in this respect, particularly for the discussion of an inner edge of the disk.\nI have found that, when the rotation to a compact object is incorporated, the locations of\nsonic point (if any) get shifted to the unstable region and the shock (if any) gets affected in\nthe disk, and thus the disk structure gets influenced. The disk properties and phenomena\nnot only get modified and/or shifted in location, sometimes disappear completely. Prasanna\n& Mukhopadhyay (2003), worked on the stability analysis of accretion disk around rotating\ncompact objects in a perturbative approach. They incorporated the rotational effect of\ncentral object in a disk indirectly by the inclusion of Coriolis acceleration term. Here, this\nrotational effect is brought directly from the metric itself.\nFrom the global analysis of sonic points, it has been shown that for a higher co-rotation\nof compact object, the disk becomes unstable for a particular angular momentum of the\naccreting matter. As the formation of shock needs a stable inner sonic point in the accretion\ndisk, for the higher value of J, shock is unstable as the inner region of disk is unstable.\nIn that regime, shock may disappear by any disturbance created on the accreting matter\nand thus the matter may not get a steady inner sonic point. On the other hand, for\ncounter-rotating cases, the angular momentum of system reduces and the matter falls more\nstrongly to a compact object. As there is no significant centrifugal barrier to slow down\nthe matter in disk, the possibility of shock reduces again. For a very high counter-rotation,\nshock disappears completely. Also the branch of inner sonic point merges or tends to merge\nto that of outer sonic point. Thus one can conclude that the parameter region where\nthe shock is expected to form (Chakrabarti 1989, 1990, 1996a) for non-rotating compact\nobjects, gets affected for the rotating ones. For a positive J, shock might have been formed\nfor a lesser value of the angular momentum of accreting matter. On the other hand, for\na negative J, to form a shock, the angular momentum of accreting matter should have a\nlarger value than that of non-rotating cases. As I am studying the sub-Keplerian accretion\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\nflow, the angular momentum of matter cannot be unlimitedly high (e.g., for a non-rotating\n< 3.6742 at last stable orbit). Thus, to form a shock, matter cannot attain the\nblack hole, \u03bb \u223c\nangular momentum beyond a certain limit. Also for a highly co-rotating compact object,\nto stabilize the disk, \u03bb has to be reduced by some physical process, otherwise the radial\nspeed could not overcome the centrifugal pressure to form a steady inner edge of the disk.\nHowever, at an intermediate co-rotation, the parameter region of accretion disk enlarges to\nhave three sonic points and there is a possibility of a stable shock. On the other hand, for\na counter-rotation, the valid parameter region with three sonic points at the disk shortens\nand thus the possibility of shock reduces. Similarly, for the higher viscosity, both the inner\nand outer sonic point branch merge each other and the possibility of shock reduces again.\nActually, with the increase of viscosity, the region containing the X-type sonic points tends\nto become O-type. The outer X-type sonic points recede in more outwards and inner ones\nproceed in inwards more.\nIn case of compact object other than black hole, as the incoming matter slows down\nabruptly at the surface of compact object as well as at two shock locations (if two shocks\nform), the overall density becomes higher for an accretion disk around it compared to\nthat for a black hole. Similarly, the temperature in the disk is lower for a black hole.\nThus, one can conclude that the accretion disk around a neutron star is very favourable\nfor nucleosynthesis. It was known that the disk around a black hole is enough hot for\nnucleosynthesis (Mukhopadhyay & Chakrabarti 2000), which is different from that in\nstar. As the density and temperature may be much higher around a neutron star, more\nefficient nucleosynthesis is expected particularly at an inner region of the disk. In early, it\nwas investigated that the high temperature of accretion disk around a black hole is very\nfavourable for the photo-dissociations and the proton capture reactions (Mukhopadhyay &\nChakrabarti 2000, 2001). As the accretion disk around a neutron (or strange) star is hotter\nthan that around a black hole, even 4He, which has a high binding energy, may dissociate\ninto deuterium and then into proton and neutron. If I consider the accreting matter to come\nfrom the nearby 'Sun like' companion star, the initial abundance of 4He in the accreting\nmatter is supposed to be about 25%. Therefore, by the dissociation of this 4He, neutron\nmay produce in a large scale, which could give rise to the neutron rich elements. Guessoum\n& Kazanas (1999) showed that the profuse neutron may be produced in the accretion disk\nand through the spallation reactions lithium may be produced in the atmosphere of the star.\nWhen the neutron comes out from the accretion disk by the formation of an outflow, in that\ncomparatively cold environment, 7Li may be produced which can be detected on the stellar\nsurface. In early, it was shown that the metalicity of the galaxy may be influenced when\noutflows form in the hot accretion disk around black holes (Mukhopadhyay & Chakrabarti\n2000). In case of the lighter galaxy, the average abundance of the isotopes of Ca, Cr may\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\nsignificantly change. Also the abundance of lighter elements, like the isotopes of C, O, Ne,\nSi etc. may increase significantly. As the temperature of the accretion disk around neutron\nstar is higher, the expected change of abundance of these elements and the corresponding\ninfluence on the metalicity of the galaxy is expected to be high.\nIt is known that, out of an observed pair of kilohertz QPO frequencies for a particular\ncandidate, one is the oscillation due to its Keplerian motion (Osherovich & Titarchuk\n1999). For 4U 1636-53, lower frequency is 950Hz (Wijnands et al. 1997) which may be\nthe Keplerian one. According to MM pseudo-potential (which presumably can describe the\ntemporal effect in the disk), if I calculate this Keplerian frequency for 4U 1636-53, it comes\nout to be 927Hz for M = 1.4M\u2299 and Keplerian radius, xK = 16.5, which is very close to\nthe observed one. Thus, I can give a theoretical prediction of QPO, at least for one, out of\na pair. Similarly, for other candidates, one can calculate Keplerian frequency according to\nthe pseudo-potential and compare with observation. The theoretical study of QPO based\non this scheme has been pursued by Mukhopadhyay et al. (2003).\n\nREFERENCES\nAbramowicz, M., Chen, X.-M., Granath, M., & Lasota, J.-P. 1996, ApJ, 471, 762\nAbramowicz, M., Czerny, B., Lasota, J., & Szuszkiewicz, E. 1988, ApJ, 332, 646\nAbramowicz, M., & Kato, S. 1989, ApJ, 336, 304\nAbramowicz, M., & Zurek, W. 1981, ApJ, 246, 314\nArtemova, I., Bj\u00f6rnsson, G., & Novikov, I. 1996, ApJ, 461, 565\nChakrabarti, S.
