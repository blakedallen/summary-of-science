Our approach\nis a prescription for how to implement existing chaos control algorithms in a way that exploits\nthe system's inherent time-delay and allows control even in the presence of substantial control-loop\nlatency (the finite time it takes signals to propagate through the components in the controller).\nThis research paves the way for applications exploiting fast control of chaos, such as chaos-based\ncommunication schemes and stabilizing the behavior of ultrafast lasers.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Gg, 05.45.-a, 05.45.Jn, 42.65.Sf\n\nBecause of its unpredictable nature, chaos is often\nviewed as an undesirable characteristic of practical devices. However, recent studies have shown that chaos can\nbe used for a variety of applications such as information\ntransmission with high power efficiency [1], generating\ntruly random numbers [2, 3], and novel spread spectrum\n[4], ultrawide-bandwidth [5, 6], and optical [7] communication schemes. For many of these applications, it is\ndesirable to operate the devices in the fast regime where\nthe typical time scale of the chaotic fluctuations is on the\norder of 1 ns [7, 8]. Many applications also require the\nability to control the chaotic trajectory to specific regions\nin phase space [9].\nOn the fast scale, the time it takes for signals to propagate through the device components is comparable to the\ntime scale of the fluctuations and hence many fast systems are most accurately described by time-delay differential equations. Examples of fast broadband chaotic oscillators that are modeled as time-delay systems include\nelectronic [10], opto-electronic [8, 11], and microwave oscillators [1], as well as lasers with delayed optical feedback [7], and nonlinear optical resonators [12]. An advantageous feature of these time-delay devices is that the\ncomplexity of the dynamics can be tuned by adjusting\nthe delay [13].\nFor applications requiring controlled trajectories, it is\npossible to use recently developed chaos-control methods. The key idea underlying these techniques is to stabilize a desired dynamical behavior by applying feedback\nthrough minute perturbations to an accessible parameter\nwhen the system is in a neighborhood of the desired trajectory in state-space [14, 15]. In particular, many of the\ncontrol protocols attempt to stabilize one of the unstable\nperiodic orbits (UPOs) that are embedded in the chaotic\nattractor. Although the research has been very successful for slow systems (characteristic time scale > 1 \u03bcs)\n[16, 17, 18, 19], applying feedback control to fast chaotic\nsystems is challenging because the controller requires a\nfinite time to sense the current state of the system, determine the appropriate perturbation, and apply it to\n\nthe system. This finite time interval, often called the\ncontrol-loop latency \u03c4l , can be problematic if the state of\nthe system is no longer correlated with its measured state\nat the time when the perturbation is applied. Typically,\nchaos control fails when the latency is on the order of the\nperiod of the UPO to be stabilized [20, 21, 22].\nThe control of very fast chaotic systems is an outstanding problem because of two challenges that arise:\ncontrol-loop latencies are unavoidable, and complex highdimensional behavior of systems is common due to inherent time-delays. The primary purpose of this Letter is\nto describe a novel approach for controlling time-delay\nsystems even in the presence of substantial control-loop\nlatency. This is a general approach that can be applied\nto any of the fast systems described above. As a specific\nexample, we demonstrate this general approach by using\ntime-delay autosynchronization control [23] to stabilize\nfast periodic oscillations (TP O \u223c12 ns) in a photonic device, the fastest controlled chaotic system to date [24].\nIn principle, much faster oscillations can be controlled\nusing, for example, high speed electronic or all-optical\ncontrol components, paving the way to using controlled\nchaotic devices in high-bandwidth applications [9, 25].\nWe have discovered that the effects of control-loop latency can be mitigated when controlling chaotic systems\ninvolving a nonlinear element and an inherent time-delay\nTD , as shown schematically in Fig. 1a. Chaos can be controlled in time-delay systems by taking advantage of the\nfact that it is often possible to measure the state of the\nsystem at one point in the time-delay loop (p1 ) and to\napply perturbations at a different point (p2 ), as shown\nin Fig. 1b. Such distributed feedback is effective because\nthe state of the system at p2 is just equal to its state\np1 delayed by the propagation time TD \u2212 \u03c421 through\nthe loop between the points. The arrival of the control\nperturbations at p2 is timed correctly if\n\u03c4l + \u03c421 = TD .\n\n(1)\n\nHence, it is possible to compensate for a reasonable\namount of control loop latency \u03c4l by appropriate choice\n\n\f2\n(a )\n\nT im e - D e la y S y s te m\n\n( b ) T im e - D e la y S y s te m\n\nw ith C o n tr o l\n\n( a ) C h a o tic P h o to n ic D e v ic e\n\n( b ) C h a o tic P h o to n ic D e v ic e w ith C o n tr o l\n\nP h o to n ic D e v ic e\n\nT\n\nt\nD\n\n2 0 d\nD ir e\nC o u\n(S ta\n\nE le c tr o n ic F e e d b a c k\nL o o p w ith D e la y\n\n2 1\n\np\n\nP h o to d io d e\n\nA m p lifie r\n\nT\n\nN o n lin e a r E le m e n t\n\np\n\nD\n\n1\n\nB\nc tio n a l\np le r\nte M o n ito r )\n\nP h o to d io d e\n\n2\n\n+\n\nO u tp u t\n\np\n2\n\nO u tp u t\n\nN o n lin e a r E le m e n t\n\np\n1\n\nE x te rn a l\nM o d u la tio n\nR F\n\nL a s e r\nD io d e\n\nIn p u t\nIn p u t\n\nD C\n\nt\nM a c h -Z e h n d e r\nIn te rfe ro m e te r\n\n2 0 d B\nD ir e c tio n a l\nC o u p le r\n(C o n tro l\nM o n ito r )\n\nt\nl\n\nA m p lifie r\n\n-\n\nC h a o s\nC o n tr o lle r\n\nS p litte r\n\nT D A S C h a o s\nC o n tr o lle r\n\nt\n\n2 1\n\nt\nk\n\nl\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematic of a typical topology of a time-delay\nsystem consisting of a nonlinear element and a long loop connecting the output to the input of the element, introducing a\ntotal time-delay TD . (b) Schematic of feedback control that\nmeasures the state at point p1 and perturbs the system at p2 .\nThe propagation time through the controller (control loop latency) is denoted by \u03c4l and \u03c421 is the propagation time from\np2 to p1 . Note that the signal takes a time TD \u2212 \u03c421 to get\nfrom p1 to p2 .\n\nof p1 and p2 . The advantage of this approach is that the\npropagation time through the controller does not have to\nbe faster than the controlled dynamics. In contrast, the\nconventional approach for controlling chaos is to perform\nthe measurement and apply the perturbations instantaneously (\u03c4l \u2192 0), which requires controller components\nthat are much faster than the components of the chaotic\ndevice to approximate instantaneous feedback. Note that\nwe have not specified a method of computing the control\nperturbations. In principle, any of the existing methods\n[14] may be used as long as they can be implemented\nwith latency satisfying Eq. 1.\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of controlling fast chaos\nusing this general concept, we apply it to a chaotic photonic device shown schematically in Fig. 2a. The device\nconsists of commercially-available components including a semiconductor laser, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and electronic time-delay feedback, and can display\nnanosecond-scale chaotic fluctuations [26]. The semiconductor laser acts as simple current-controlled source that\nconverts current oscillations into oscillations of the optical frequency and, to a lesser extent, amplitude. Light\ngenerated by the laser traverses an unequal-path MachZehnder interferometer whose output is a nonlinear function of the optical frequency. The light exiting the interferometer is converted to a voltage using a fast silicon photodiode and a resistor. This voltage propagates\nthrough a delay line (a short piece of coaxial cable), is\namplified and bandpass filtered, and is then used to mod-\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Experimental setup of a chaotic time-delay device of the type shown in Fig. 1a. The nonlinear element is a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer and the delay loop consists of a\nphotodiode, coaxial cable, an amplifier and a semiconductor\nlaser. The electronic signal is applied to the laser through a\nbias-T (capacitor and inductor) which converts the RF-signal\nto a current and adds it to the DC-injection current. See [26]\nfor details. (b) Experimental system with controller. The\nmeasurement point p1 is the second beam splitter of the interferometer. Perturbations are applied at p2 , an RF-power\ncombiner. The time \u03c421 for a signal to propagate from point\np2 to p1 is \u223c 3 ns. The controller contains two delay lines,\nthe first sets \u03c4k , the period of the orbit to be controlled, the\nsecond is used to adjust the latency \u03c4l to properly time the\narrival of perturbations at p2 . The state of the system is monitored through a directional coupler positioned directly after\nthe photodiode in the delay loop of the photonic device. The\ncontrol signal is measured through a directional coupler at the\noutput of the controller.\n\nulate the laser injection current by combining it with the\ndc injection current via a bias-T. The system is subject\nto an external driving force provided by adding an RF\nvoltage to the feedback signal. (The driven system has\nmore prominent bifurcations than the undriven device.)\nThe length of the coaxial cable can be adjusted to obtain\nvalues of the time-delay TD in the range 11 - 20 ns. This\nphotonic device displays a range of periodic and chaotic\nbehavior that is set by the amplifier gain and the ratio of\nthe time-delay to the characteristic response time of the\nsystem (typically set to a large value).\nFigure 3a shows the chaotic temporal evolution of the\nvoltage measured immediately after the photodiode when\nthe device operates in the absence of control. The corresponding broadband power spectrum is shown in Fig. 3b.\nThe behavior of the system is well described by a delaydifferential equation, which we use to investigate numerically the observed dynamics [26]. The predicted chaotic\noscillations and power spectrum are shown in Fig. 3e and\nf, respectively.\nWe apply our control method to the photonic device\nusing the setup shown in Fig. 2b by measuring the state\n\n\f3\n250\n\n-40\n\n0\n\n\u03be(t) (mV)\n\nb)\n\nPower Spectrum (dBm)\n\na)\n\n20\n\n-20\n\nno\ncontrol\n\n-60\n\n-20\n40\n\nc)\n\n20\n\n-20\n\nd)\n\n-40\n\n0\n\nwith\ncontrol\n\n-60\n-20\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n0\n\nTime (ns)\n\n100 200 300 400 500\n\nFrequency (MHz)\n\n20\n\n-40\n\n\u03be(t) (mV)\n\n0\n\nno\ncontrol\n\n-60\n\n-20\n40\n\ng)\n\n20\n\n-20\n\nh)\n\n-40\n\n0\n\nwith\ncontrol\n\n-60\n-20\n\n0\n\n50\n\nTime (ns)\n\n100\n\n0\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n14\n\nf)\n\nPower Spectrum (dBm)\n\ne)\n\n-20\n\n200\n\n0\n\nSimulation\n40\n\nAverage Control Signal (mV)\n\nExperiment\n40\n\n100 200 300 400 500\n\nFrequency (MHz)\n\nFIG. 3: Experimental (a-d) and simulated (e-h) data showing\ncontrol of fast chaos.

For a\ngiven device time-delay TD , coaxial cable can be added or\nremoved from the control loop to obtain a value of \u03c4l +\u03c421\nsatisfying Eq. 1. To compute the control perturbations \u03b5,\nwe use a scheme known as time-delay autosynchronization (TDAS), an algorithm that synchronizes the system to its state one orbital period in the past by setting\n\u03b5(t) = \u03b3[\u03be(t) \u2212 \u03be(t \u2212 \u03c4k )] where \u03c4k is a control-loop delay\nthat is set equal to the period TP O of the desired orbit,\nand \u03b3 is the control gain [23, 27]. When synchronization\nwith the delayed state is successful, the trajectory of the\ncontrolled system is precisely on the UPO and the control signal is comparable to the noise level in the system.\nWe emphasize that TDAS-control was chosen for ease of\nimplementation in this proof-of-concept experiment but\nthat our approach is consistent with other control methods applicable to delay systems (e.g. [28, 29]).\nControlling the fast photonic device is initiated by set-\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n\u03c4l+\u03c421(ns)\n\n22\n\n24\n\nFIG. 4: Time-averaged control signal in the experiment\n(circles) and simulation (triangles). The minimum centered\naround TD = 19.1 ns is the region of successful control, where\nh\u03b5(t)i is at the noise level (\u223c 30 mV, estimated by breaking\nthe control loop and measuring the control signal when the\nphotonic device is in a periodic regime). The width of the\nminimum (\u223c 0.5 ns) indicates that control succeeds despite\nsmall errors in \u03c4l + \u03c421 . Noise in the experiment smooths out\nthe sharp transition from controlled to uncontrolled behavior\nobserved in simulation.\n\nting the various control-loop time delays (\u03c4l + \u03c421 and \u03c4k )\nand applying the output of the TDAS controller to point\np2 with \u03b3 set to a low value (\u03b3 = 0.1 mV/mW). Upon\nincreasing \u03b3 to 10.3 mV/mW, we observe that \u03b5(t) decreases, which we further minimize by making fine adjustments to \u03c4k and \u03c4l + \u03c421 . Successful control is indicated\nwhen \u03b5(t) drops to the noise level of the device. Figure 3c\nshows the periodic temporal evolution of the controlled\norbit with a period of TP O \u223c12 ns. The corresponding\npower spectrum, shown in Fig. 3d, is dominated by a single fundamental frequency of 81 MHz and it's harmonics.\nThe observation of successful stabilization of one of the\nUPOs embedded in the chaos of the uncontrolled photonic device is consistent with the theoretical prediction\nof a mathematical model describing the photonic device\nin the presence of control, as shown in Figs. 3g and h,\nwhere the simulated time series and power spectrum, respectively, indicate periodic oscillations.\nThe data shown in Fig. 3 is the primary result of\nour experiment, demonstrating the feasibility of controlling chaos in high-bandwidth systems even when the latency is comparable to the characteristic time scales of\nthe chaotic device (compare TP O \u223c12 ns and \u03c4l \u223c 8 ns).\nTo control this fast UPO, we used the smallest value of\n\u03c4l + \u03c421 attainable with our current experimental apparatus. Hence, it is not possible to fully explore the effects\non control when we change \u03c421 . Therefore, we slowed\ndown the chaotic photonic device by increasing TD . In\nthis way, we can explore (\u03c4l + \u03c421 ) over a range includ-\n\n\f4\ning values that are shorter than TD . Figure 4 shows the\nsize of the measured (circles) and predicted (line) control\nperturbations as a function of \u03c4l + \u03c421 . It is seen that\ncontrol is possible over a reasonably large range of time\ndelays (\u223c0.5 ns) centered on TD so that it is not necessary to set precisely the control-loop delay, a practical\nbenefit of this scheme.\nFrom the data shown in Fig. 4, we can infer what would\nhappen if p1 = p2 (the conventional method of implementing chaos control with nearly instantaneous feedback). In this case, \u03c421 = TD and hence control would\nonly be effective when \u03c4l <0.5 ns, which is not possible\nusing our implementation of TDAS. Note that the shortest reported control-loop latency of a chaos controller is\n4.4 ns [30], much too large to control our device.\nIn principle, faster time-delay chaotic systems can be\ncontrolled using our approach as long as the controller\nuses technology (e.g., integrated circuits, all-optical) that\nis as fast as the system to be controlled so that \u03c4l is comparable to TD . Traditional chaos control schemes require\nthat \u03c4l be much shorter than TD , increasing substantially\nthe cost and complexity of the controller. With regards\nto potential applications, we note that adjustments to\nour controller allows for controlling different UPOs embedded in the chaotic system, which could be used for\nsymbolic-dynamic-based communication schemes. Overall, our research points out the importance of using timedelay dynamical systems combined with distributed control for applications requiring fast controlled chaos.\nFinally, our approach of control in the presence of\ncontrol-loop latency is equally useful for non-chaotic fast\nand ultrafast time-delay devices, where the fast time scale\nmakes the suppression of undesired instabilities challenging (e.g. the double pulsing instability in femtosecond\nfiber lasers [31].)\nThe authors thank J.
