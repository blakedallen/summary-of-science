Given a relativistic quantum field theory\n(rqft), the non-relativistic limit (nrl), i.e., the formal limit c \u2192 \u221e, is used to identify the\ncorresponding non-relativistic theory. In spite of the conceptual importance of this topic,\nvery few papers have been devoted to the rigorous study of the non-relativistc limit: the\nclassic paper of Hunziker on the nrl of the Dirac equation [1], and Dimock's proof of the nrl\nof the : \u03c64 :2 -theory in the two-particle sector [2].\nIn this paper we address the problem of thermodynamic stability in the formal nrl of\nsome relativistic quantum field theories, as well as other related issues concerning qualitative\ndifferences between relativistic vacua and the ground states of the non-relativistic many\nparticle systems.\nIn Section 2 necessary notation and definitions pertaining to the : \u03c64 :s+1 theories and\ntheir formal nrl are introduced.\nAMS 1991 Subject Classification. 81T08, 82B21, 82B31, 46L55\nKey words and phrases.

Jackiw [3], we then show in Section 3 that, for s = 2, and a\ngiven value of the ultraviolet cutoff \u03ba, there are two ways to perform the nrl: i.) fixing\nthe renormalized mass m2 equal to the bare mass and ii.) keeping the renormalized mass\ndifferent from the bare mass, i.e., m2 = m20 . In the (infinite-volume) two-particle sector the\nscattering amplitude tends to zero as \u03ba \u2192 \u221e in case i.) and, in case ii.), there is a bound\nstate, indicating that the interaction potential is attractive. As a consequence, stability of\nmatter fails for our boson system. We discuss why both alternatives do not reproduce the\nlow energy behavior of the full relativistic theory.\nR. Jackiw [3] treated the problem by the method of the self-adjoint extension, but did not\nattempt to identify the free parameter occurring there with the physical parameters of the\nfull relativistic theory. We complete his work by showing that, in case ii.), the existence of a\nbound state follows from the two-body interaction Hamiltonian obtained in the formal nrl,\nand that the renormalized mass of the full theory is uniquely related to the free parameter\ndetermining the bound state in the nrl. Case i.) has been considered previously by B\u00e9g\nand Furlong [4] and K. Huang [5]. The singular nature of the nrl is also nicely illustrated\nin Section 4 by a rigorous stability/instability result, now for s = 1, namely, that complete\nsemi-passivity (a notion introduced in [6]), which is equivalent to the stability of the vacuum\nin the presence of an observer in uniform motion to the vacuum's reference system, holds in\nrqft but is violated by the nrl. Section 5 is devoted to a conclusion and open problems.\n\n2\n\nThe (: \u03c64 :)s+1 theories and their formal nrl\n\nThe relativistic : \u03c64 :s+1 model Consider the Hamiltonian of a self-interacting scalar\nfield of bare mass m0 in s space dimensions, confined to a box of sides l = (l1 , . . . , ls ) and\nultraviolet cutoff \u03ba (see [7][8]) (the supscript rel. stands for 'relativistic'):\nrel.\nrel.\nHl,\u03ba\n= H0rel. + Vl,\u03ba\n.\n\n(2.1)\n\nAs usual, H0rel. is the kinetic energy operator\nZ\n(2.2)\nH0rel. = ds ~p a\u2217 (~\np )\u03c9c (~\np )a(~\np ),\nwhere a(~\np ), a\u2217 (~\np ) are standard annihilation and creation operators on the symmetric Fock\nspace F (H) over H = L2 (IRs , ds ~x ) satisfying (formally)\n[a(~\np ), a\u2217 (~\np \u2032 )] = \u03b4(~\np \u2212 p~ \u2032 ),\nand\n(2.3)\n\n\u03c9c (~\np ) = (~\np 2 c2 + m20 c4 )1/2 .\n\nLet \u03c6c,\u03ba denote the (time-zero) scalar field of mass m0 with a sharp ultraviolet cutoff \u03ba:\nZ\n\u0001\nds p~\n\u2212s/2\nc\n(2.4) \u03c6c,\u03ba (~x) = (2\u03c0)\np ) + a(\u2212~\np) ,\ni = 1, . . . , s.\ne\u2212i~p~x a\u2217 (~\n1/2\np ))\n|pi |<\u03ba (2\u03c9c (~\nThe interaction is\n\n(2.5)\n\nrel.\nVl,\u03ba\n= \u03bb0\n\nZ\n\n|xi |\u2264l/2\n\nds ~x : \u03c64c,\u03ba : + (\u03b4m\u03ba )2\n\nZ\n\n|xi |\u2264l/2\n\nds ~x : \u03c62c,\u03ba :,\n\ni = 1, . . . , s,\n\n(+ eventual renormalization counterterms).

By (2.2) and\n(2.5) taking the thermodynamic limit l \u2192 \u221e in the (\u03b4m\u03ba )2 -term in (2.5) we obtain an\neffective kinetic energy\nZ\n(2.9)\n\nH\u03030 :=\n\nds ~p a\u2217 (~\np )\u03c9\u0303c (~\np )a(~\np)\n\nwith\n(2.10)\n\n\u03c9\u0303c (~\np ) = (~\np 2 c2 + m2 c4 )1/2 .\n\nHere\n(2.11)\n\nm2 := m20 + (\u03b4m\u03ba )2\n\nis the renormalized mass. We shall assume that (2.9)\u2212 (2.11) are valid for \u03ba and l sufficiently\nlarge, with m (close to) a fixed positive value, the 'observed particle mass'. Thus, the\nHamiltonian (2.1) may be written\nrel.,s\nHl,\u03ba\n:= H\u03030 + \u1e7cl,\u03ba ,\n\n(2.12)\nwhere\n(2.13)\n\n\u1e7cl,\u03ba := \u03bb0\n\nZ\n\n|xi |\u2264l/2\n\nds ~x : \u03c64c,\u03ba : + (other renormalization counterterms).\n\nBy (2.10), as c \u2192 \u221e, we have\n(2.14)\n\n\u03c9\u0303c (~\np ) = mc2 +\n\n3\n\np~ 2\n+ O(c\u22122 ).\n2m\n\n\fLet\n(2.15)\n\nN=\n\nZ\n\nds ~p a\u2217 (~\np )a(~\np)\n\ndenote the number operator. We denote by n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , its eigenvalues, whose corresponding eigenspaces are the n-particle sectors. We note that for s = 2 the ultraviolet\nrenormalization involves a change of representation and the Fock space number operator is\nno longer appropriate. We will avoid this problem by keeping the UV cutoff \u03ba in case s = 2.\nBy (2.9), (2.12) and (2.14), there exists in the limit c \u2192 \u221e an infinite 'Zitterbewegung'\nterm N * mc2 . If we keep c fixed in this term, the Zitterbewegung term guarantees that the\nenergy-momentum spectrum of the non-relativistic theory lies inside the relativistic forward\nlight cone, if stability of matter holds with a sufficiently small constant. In other words, the\nnrl satisfies the relativistic spectrum condition.\nSince the Zitterbewegung term (with c = 1) is constant for fixed particle number, it is\nusually ignored (this formal subtraction being part of the limiting prescription). We thereby\nobtain from (2.4), (2.12), (2.13) and (2.14), in the formal limit c \u2192 \u221e, the non-relativistic\nmany-body Hamiltonian\nR\np\n~2 \u2217\na (~\np )+\nHln.-rel., s = ds p~ a\u2217 (~\np ) 2m\n(2.16)\nR\nR\n(s)\ns\n0\nx |~y|\u2264l/2 ds ~y a\u2217 (~x )a\u2217 (~y )\u03b4\u03ba (~x \u2212 ~y )a(~y )a(~x ).\n+ 21 3\u03bb\nx|\u2264l/2 d ~\nm2 |~\n0\n\nHere\nby\n\n(s)\n\u03b4\u03ba\n\n(2.17)\nwith\n(2.18)\n\n(s)\n\nis the 'regularized' delta function whose Fourier transform \u03b4\u0303\u03ba acts on L2 (IRs , ds~k )\nZ\n(s)  \u0303 ~\n(\u03b4\u0303\u03ba f )(k ) = ds p~ \u03c7\u03ba (~\np )1l(~k \u2212 p~ )\u03c7\u03ba (~k )f \u0303(~\np ),\nf \u0303 \u2208 L2 (IRs , ds~k ),\n\u03c7\u03ba (~\nq ) = \u03c7\u03ba (q1 )\u03c7\u03ba (q2 ) . . . \u03c7\u03ba (qs )\n\nfor ~q = (q1 , . . . , qs ) and\n(2.19)\n\n\u03c7\u03ba (q) =\n\nn\n\n1\n0\n\n|q| \u2264 \u03ba,\notherwise.\n\nThis is a consequence of the sharp momentum cutoff in (2.5). In (2.16), the factor 23 = 46\narises from the number of ways of getting two creators and two annihilators in the Wick\nproduct (2.5).\n\nRemark 2.1 It is remarkable that Dimock [2] showed convergence of the two-particle\n0\nscattering amplitude of the rqft for s = 1 to the corresponding object for the 3\u03bb\n\u03b4(x) potential\nm20\nin the case n = 2 (specializing the more general theorem of [2] to our case). We assume\nthat convergence also holds for general n as conjectured in [2](Concluding Remark 2). In\ncorrespondence to (2.16) we also assume convergence of the rqft (2.12) for s = 2 to the\nnonrelativistic theory (2.16) in the same sense described in [2] but only for \u03ba smaller than\ninfinity (the limit \u03ba tending to infinity is subtle, see [18]). The terms with particle creation\nand destruction (including the vacuum polarization term) do not automatically drop from\n(2.12), (2.13) in the formal (nrl), but Dimock's work leads us to expect (and assume) that\nthey are absent. The other renormalization counterterms in (2.13) yield (for 0 < \u03ba < \u221e)\nconstants, as c \u2192 \u221e, which do not affect the discussion of thermodynamic stability (see [9],\nTheorem 2.4 and 2.5, and Theorem 6.2). We shall thus ignore them henceforth.\n\nThe formal limit (2.16) commutes with the number operator N and thus leaves each nparticle sector (where n = 0, 1, . . . , is an eigenvalue of N ) invariant. The Hamiltonian (2.16)\ncorresponds to the two-body Hamiltonian\n(2.20)\n\nn.-rel., s\nH\u03ba,2\n=\u2212\n\n1\n\u2206 + V\u03ba(s) ,\n2m\n\n4\n\n\fwhere \u2206 is the Laplacian,\nV\u03ba(s) :=\n\n(2.21)\n\n3\u03bb0 (s)\n\u03b4 (~x ) ,\nm20 \u03ba\n\n(s)\n\nand \u03b4\u03ba is given by (2.17).\nWe shall consider (as in [2], for s = 1 and \u03ba = \u221e) the above Hamiltonian in infinite space,\ni.e., as an operator on L2 (IRs ). The corresponding Hamiltonian restricted to the n-particle\nsector is\nn\nX\n1 X\nn.-rel., s\n\u2206i +\n(2.22)\nV\u03ba(s) (~xi \u2212 ~xj )\nH\u03ba,n\n=\u2212\n2m i=1\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\n2\n\nsn\n\non L (IR ).\nNext we consider a notion of stability which usually is referred to as \"stability of matter\".\nn.-rel., s\nn.-rel.,s\nDefinition 2.2 Let E\u03ba,n\ndenote the infimum of H\u03ba,n\nin the n-particle sector. The\nn.-rel.,s\nnon-relativistic Hamiltonian H\u03ba,n\nis stable if \u2203 0 < Cn.-rel., \u03ba < \u221e such that\n\n(2.23)\n\nn.-rel., s\nEn,\u03ba\n\u2265 \u2212Cn.-rel.,\u03ba n\n\n\u2200n \u2208 IN.\n\nIt is important to remark that, formally, the density \u03c1 = lns corresponding to the nonreln.-rel., s\nativistic Hamiltonian H\u03ba,n\nis zero (in Ref. [2], for instance, s = 1; n = 2 and l = \u221e). For\ns = 1 and \u03ba = \u221e we have that (2.22) becomes\nn\n\n(2.24)\n\nn.-rel., s=1\nH\u03ba,n\n=\u2212\n\n1 X \u22022\n3\u03bb0\n+ 2\n2\n2m i=1 \u2202xi\nm0\n\nX\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\n\u03b4(xi \u2212 xj ).\n\nThe above formal expression (2.24) may be made precise in a standard way (Example X.3 of\n[13]). Taking, however, (2.24) with periodic b.c. on a segment of length l the corresponding\nquantity Hn,l too may be defined for arbitrary n \u2208 IN as in [14] and in this case one branch\nof the correponding elementary excitations of momentum p is, in the hard core case, (see\n[15] Part II, Equ. (2.8), p. 1618)\n\u01eb1 (p) = p2 + 2\u03c0\u03c1|p|\n\n(2m = 1);\n\nthis agrees with the free case (only) if \u03c1 = 0.\nAll this makes it clear that there is a certain weak point in our comparison: the relativistic\nneutral scalar : \u03c64 : models do not allow us to vary the particle density independently from\nthe temperature. Thus it would be interesting to investigate the non-relativistic limit of\ncharged sectors in the : \u03c6\u03c6 :2 model, where the charge (density) can be kept constant.\nThe definition of the regularized delta function (2.17) does not make the (in)stability\nproperties of the corresponding two-body potential explicit: for that purpose, it is judicious\nto search a representation in configuration space. We present two versions of the two-body\npotential in infinite volume.\n\nThe lattice approximation in infinite volume Let B\u01eb := [\u2212 \u03c0\u01eb , \u03c0\u01eb ]2 denote the first\n\nBrillouin zone of an (infinite) lattice of spacing \u01eb along the coordinate axes. The (latticecutoff) Hilbert space is H\u01eb := l2 (ZZs ). On H\u01eb we define the Hamiltonian corresponding\nto (2.16) in the 2-particle sector. Separating the center of mass Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian\nin relative coordinates is\n(2.25)\nH\u01eb := H0,\u01eb + V\u01eb ,\nwhere\n(2.26)\n\n(H0,\u01eb \u03a8)(~k) = E\u01eb (~k)\u03a8(~k)\n\n5\n\n\fwith\n(2.27)\n\nE\u01eb (~k) = \u01eb\u22122\n\n2\nX\ni=1\n\nand\n(2.28)\n\n~k = (k1 , k2 ),\n\n(1 \u2212 cos \u01ebki ),\n\n(V\u01eb \u03a8)(~k) =\n\n3\u03bb0\nm20\n\nZ\n\nd2~k \u03a8(~k).\n\nB\u01eb\n\nNote that (2.28) corresponds precisely to (2.16) and (2.17) on the lattice, with\n(2.29)\n\n\u03ba = \u03c0/\u01eb.\n\nThe square-well regularization We replace V\u01eb in (2.28) by the potential\n(2.30)\nwhere\n(2.31)\nand\n(2.32)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n3\u03bb0\nV \u01eb ~x := 2 \u03a6\u01eb ~x\nm0\n\u00012\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u01eb ~x := \u03c7\u01eb |~xi \u2212 ~xj | 2\n\u01eb\n\u0001 n\n\u03c7\u01eb |~xi \u2212 ~xj | =\n\n1\n0\n\nif\n\n0 \u2264 |~x| \u2264 \u01eb,\notherwise.\n\nWe shall identify \u03ba in (2.22) with (2.29) also for (2.30). This is true (up to a multiplicative\nfactor), see ((3.35),(3.40) and the remark thereafter in Ref. [3]). This assertion means that\nbound state energies and scattering amplitudes agree in both models (see also Ref. [16]). In\nthe following, we shall thus feel free to use the square-well regularization as a prototype to\nprove our main results.\n\n3\n\nThe formal nrl for s = 2\n\nConsider the two-body Hamiltonian (2.20). If 0 < \u03ba < \u221e, the nrl may be performed in\ntwo ways: i.) by insisting that the mass renormalization constant (\u03b4m\u03ba )2 = 0 in (2.11),\ni.e., m2 = m20 ; ii.) by fixing the physical mass m2 in (2.11), i.e., (\u03b4m\u03ba )2 \u2192 \u221e for \u03ba \u2192 \u221e.\nAccordingly we have the following result.\nProposition 3.1 In case i.) the scattering amplitude for (2.20) tends to zero as \u03ba \u2192 \u221e.\nIn case ii.) there exists \u03ba0 such that, if \u03ba0 < \u03ba < \u221e, there exists a bound state, the coupling\nconstant is negative and (thus) the corresponding bosonic Hamiltonian (2.22) is unstable\naccording to Definition 2.2.\nProof. In case i.), by (2.11) and (2.21), the scattering solutions f \u0303 corresponding to the\npotential in (2.17) in the two-particle sector satisfy the Lippman-Schwinger equation (we\nchoose an informal presentation following closely [3] in order to avoid unnecessary technicalities, but the results agree completely with those in Chapter I.5 of [17], obtained by the\nmethod of self-adjoint extensions). We start from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\n(3.33)\n\n3\u03bb0\n1\n(~\np 2 \u2212 ~k 2 )f \u0303(~\np ) = \u2212 2 V(f \u0303, \u03ba)\n2m0\nm0\n\nwhere\n(3.34)\n\nV(f \u0303, \u03ba) :=\n\nZ\n\n|~\npi |\u2264\u03ba; i=1,2\n\n6\n\nd2 p~  \u0303\nf (~\np)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n\fand\n\n~k 2\n=E>0\n2m0\nis the energy of the scattered particles.

Since, from (3.36), 3\u03bb\nV(f \u0303, \u03ba) is the scattering amplim20\ntude, we have from (3.41) that it tends to zero as \u03ba \u2192 \u221e, which is the first result. This\nobservation is already contained in [3], [4] and [5].\nConcerning ii.) we also follow [3] but, instead of appealing to the method of self-adjoint\nextension with a free parameter we use (2.20), replacing, however, m20 in the denominator of\n(2.21) by equation (2.11)\n(3.42)\nm20 = m2 \u2212 \u03b4m2\u03ba\n\nwith m2 fixed.

By (3.42) and (3.43), with (2.29)\u2013(2.32), the Hamiltonian\n(2.20) tends, in the norm resolvent sense, to a self-adjoint point interaction Hamiltonian\nas \u01eb \u2192 0 (or \u03ba \u2192 \u221e), the \"\u03b4 (2) (~x )\" with the precise properties which we shall now use,\nfollowing [3] ([17], Chapter I.5, (5.47) and Theorem 5.5). These properties are equivalent to\nthe following \"field theoretic\" language [3]: taking the \"bare coupling\" (here of the formal\n0\n) to be cutoff-dependent, we may now introduce a \"renormalized\nnrl, i.e., the coupling 3\u03bb\nm20\ncoupling contant g\" (again of the nonrelativistic theory) in terms of which (3.41) may be\nwritten\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\n~\n3\u03bb0\n \u0303, \u03ba) = 1 \u2212 1 ln |k| + i\u01eb\n(3.44)\nV(\nf\nm20\ng \u03c0\n\u03bc\n2\n\n7\n\n\f0\nabsorbs by definition the cutoff\nwhich is finite and well-defined, provided the factor 1/ 3\u03bb\nm20\ndependence [3]:\n1\n1 \u03ba\nm2\n(3.45)\n= 0 + ln .\ng\n3\u03bb0\n\u03c0 \u03bc\n\nFrom here we proceed as in [3], but for the benefit of the reader, we summarize the main\nsteps. Write the Lippman-Schwinger equation (3.36) in configuration space (see also [17],\nChapter I.5):\n\u0001\n6\u03bb0\n~\n(3.46)\nf (~x ) = eik~x \u2212 2 Gk |~x| V(f \u0303, \u03ba)\nm0\n\u0001\nwhere Gk |~x| is the Green's function appropriate to two dimensions,\n\u0001\n(\u2212\u2206 \u2212 ~k 2 )Gk |~x| = \u03b4 (2) (~x ) ,\n\n(3.47)\n\nand, thus,\n(3.48)\nFrom\n\n~\n\u0001\nei(|k| |~x|+\u03c0/4)\nGk |~x| \u2192 q\n2 2\u03c0|~k| |~x|\n\nfor |~x| \u2192 \u221e.\n\n1\n~\n~\nf (~x ) \u223c eik~x + p f (\u03b8)ei(|k||~x|+\u03c0/4) ,\n|~x|\n\n(3.46), and (3.48) we obtain\n(3.49)\n\n3\u03bb0\n1\nf (\u03b8) = \u2212 q\nV(f \u0303, \u03ba) = \u2212 q\n2\nm\n2\u03c0|~k| 0\n2\u03c0|~k|\n1\n\n1 |~k| i\u01eb\n1\n\u2212 ln\n+\ng \u03c0\n\u03bc\n2\n\n!\n~\n\n2\n\n2\nand thus only s-wave scattering takes place with phase shift \u03b40 such that cot \u03b40 = \u03c01 ln |k|\n\u03bc \u2212 g;\nit may also be seen [3] alternatively to g, that one may fix a bound state energy B (E = \u2212B)\nsuch that\n1 \u0010 1\ni\u01eb \u0011\u22121\n2B\nf (\u03b8) = \u2212 q\n(3.50)\n+\nln\n2\u03c0 |~k|2\n2\n2\u03c0|~k|\n\nwith\n(3.51)\n\n\u221a\n2B = \u03bc e\u03c0/g .\n\nBy (2.21), (3.42) and (3.43) we see that the point-interaction in two space dimensions is\nalways attractive (for fixed 0 < m2 < \u221e and \u03ba sufficiently large), and thus, since there are\nno additional repulsive interactions (no \"hard core\"), the hamiltonian is unstable according\nto the Definition 2.2 by standard arguments ([18], p.62). We expect that the Hamiltonian\nconverges in norm-resolvent sense to the n-body interaction Hamiltonian defined in [18],\nwhich is also unstable according to Definition 2.2. Finally, (2.11) and (3.43), m2 may be\nidentified with ( g1 ), and is, thus, not surprisingly, the free parameter of the full (relativistic)\ntheory which occurs in the method of self-adjoint extension (see [17][3]). Thus we see that g\nmust be chosen positive, which is not an a priori consequence of (3.51). This completes the\nproof of Proposition 3.1.\n\nRemark 3.1 Alternative i.) corresponds to setting \u03b4m2\u03ba \u2261 0 by (2.11). It may be argued\nthat the mass counterterm is created solely to cancel diagrams in which the particle number\nchanges (see [7]) and since the latter terms are expected to vanish in the nrl, it would be\nconsistent to require assumption i.). On the other hand, Proposition 3.1 shows that one\n\n8\n\n\fthereby obtains zero scattering amplitude in the formal nrl, which does not correspond to\nthe low-energy behavior of the full theory, which is nontrivial ([7][8]).\nAlternatively ii.) corresponds to the principle that although the function of the mass\nterm is to cancel particle-changing diagrams which do not appear in the nrl, it also fixes\nthe physical parameters of the full (: \u03c64 :)3 theory (i.e., with all the terms, including those\nchanging particle numbers), and thus must be kept fixed upon performing the formal nrl.\nWe see this clearly from the fact that the \u03b4m2\u03ba -termpcontributes to the free (kinetic) energy,\nyielding the renormalized mass m. In fact, it is not p2 c2 + m20 c4 that is expanded to obtain\np\np\n~2\nthe nonrelativistic kinetic energy, but p~ 2 c2 + m2 c4 = mc2 + 2m\n+ O(c\u22122 ), see (2.14). In\nother words, it is particles with mass m that scatter, also in the nonrelativistic limit! This\nis also the basis of Bethe's nonrelativistic treatment of the Lamb shift [19]. Finally, the\n\u03b4m2\u03ba -term in (2.5) also contains particle conserving terms.\nAlthough the above arguments favor, in our opinion, assumption ii.), the latter also yields\na result in complete disagreement with the low-energy behavior of the full theory. Indeed the\nrqft is stable according to Definition 2.1 (a consequence of Nelson's symmetry, see, e.g., [9]).\nThe interaction is expected to be of purely repulsive character, and in particular no bound\nstates are expected to exist in the full rqft [20]. Although the latter reference pertains to the\ncase s = 1, the methods used ,in particular, Lebowitz's inequality, should be applicable to\nshow the same assertion for s = 2. We comment further on the above mentioned disagreement\nin the last section.\nEliminating the \"Zitterbewegung\" term already accounts for the singular nature of the\nnrl, which is responsible for instability results of a different nature, which we now examine.\n\n4\n\nPassivity and Local Thermodynamic Stability\n\nLet us consider a C \u2217 -dynamical system, consisting of a C \u2217 -algebra A and a one-parameter\ngroup of automorphisms {\u03c4t }t\u2208IR . When the time-evolution t 7\u2192 \u03c4t \u2208 Aut(A) is changed\nby a local perturbation, which is slowly switched on and slowly switched off again, then an\nequilibrium state returns to its original form at the end of this procedure. This heuristic\ncondition of adiabatic invariance can be expressed by the stability requirement\nZ t\n\u0001\nlim\n(4.52)\ndt \u03c9 [a, \u03c4t (b)] = 0\n\u2200a, b \u2208 A.\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212t\n\nIn a pioniering work Haag, Kastler and Trych-Pohlmeyer [21] showed that the characterization (4.52) of an equilibrium state leads to a sharp mathematical criterion, first encountered by Haag, Hugenholtz and Winnink [22] and more implicitly by Kubo [23], Martin and\nSchwinger [24]:\nDefinition 4.1 A state \u03c9\u03b2 over a C \u2217 -algebra A is called a KMS state for some \u03b2 > 0, if\nfor all a, b \u2208 A, there exists a function Fa,b which is continuous in the strip 0 \u2264 Iz \u2264 \u03b2 and\nanalytic and bounded in the open strip 0 < Iz < \u03b2, with boundary values given by\n\u0001\n\u0001\nFa,b (t) = \u03c9\u03b2 a\u03c4t (b) and Fa,b (t + i\u03b2) = \u03c9\u03b2 \u03c4t (b)a \u2200t \u2208 IR.\n\nThe amount of work a cycle can perform when applied to a moving thermodynamic\nequilibrium state is bounded by the amount of work an ideal windmill or turbine could\nperform; this property is called semi-passivity [6]: A state \u03c9 is called semi-passive (passive)\nif there is an 'efficiency bound' E \u2265 0 (E = 0) such that\n\u2212(W \u03a9\u03c9 , H\u03c9 W \u03a9\u03c9 ) \u2264 E * (W \u03a9\u03c9 , |P\u03c9 |W \u03a9\u03c9 )\n\n9\n\n\ffor all unitary elements W \u2208 \u03c0\u03c9 (A)\u2032\u2032 , which satisfy\n[H\u03c9 , W ] \u2208 \u03c0\u03c9 (A)\u2032\u2032 ,\n\n[P\u03c9 , W ] \u2208 \u03c0\u03c9 (A)\u2032\u2032 .\n\nHere (H\u03c9 , P\u03c9 ) denote the generators implementing the space-time translations in the GNS\nrepresentation (H\u03c9 , \u03a9\u03c9 , \u03c0\u03c9 ).\nGeneralizing the notion of complete passivity (which is related to the zeroth law of thermodynamics), the state \u03c9 is called completely semi-passive if all its finite tensorial powers\nare semipassive with respect to one fixed efficiency bound E. It has been shown by Kuckert\n[6] that a state is completely semi-passive in all inertial frames if and only if it is completely\npassive in some inertial frame. The latter implies that \u03c9 is a KMS-state or a ground state\n(a result due to Pusz and Woronowicz). We shall be interested in the latter case.\nFor ground states (characterized by the positivity of the energy operator H \u2265 0) the\nstability property (4.52) implies the existence of a mass gap:\nProposition 4.2 (Bratteli, Kishimoto, Robinson [25, Theorem 3]). Let (A, \u03c4 ) be a C \u2217 dynamical system and let \u03c9 be a strongly clustering \u03c4 -ground state, i.e.,\n\u0001\n(4.53)\nlim \u03c9 a\u03c4t (b) = \u03c9(a)\u03c9(b)\n\u2200a, b \u2208 A.\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nLet U\u03c9 (t) = eitH\u03c9 be the unitary group which implements \u03c4 in the GNS representation\n(H\u03c9 , \u03c0\u03c9 , \u03a9\u03c9 ). Then the condition (4.52) is equivalent to the existence of some \u01eb > 0 such\nthat\nsp H\u03c9 \u2282 {0} \u222a [\u01eb, \u221e[ ,\nwhere sp H\u03c9 denotes the spectrum of H\u03c9 .\n\nBy [26, Theorem 2] or [27, Theorem 1], if the dynamics \u03c4t is nontrivial, i.e., H\u03c9 is not\n0, the extension of \u03c9 to \u03c0\u03c9 (A)\u2032\u2032 is nonfaithful and completely passive if and only if it is a\nground state (see Footnote 1). The following proposition of [6] is thus applicable:\nProposition 4.3 ([6, Proposition 3.2]). Let \u03c9 be completely semi-passive with efficiency\nbound E. If \u03c9 is not faithful, then there exists some ~u \u2208 IRs , |~u| \u2264 E, such that\n(4.54)\n\nH\u03c9 + ~uP~\u03c9 \u2265 0.\n\nProposition 4.3 only asserts the existence of some ~u, with |~u| \u2264 E, satisfying (4.54), but\nit may well be that only ~u = 0 satisfies (4.54). This is however not the case in rqft. Consider\nthe (: \u03c64 :)2 theory; we omit the superscript s = 1 henceforth.\nProposition 4.4 The inequality (4.54) holds for the (: \u03c64 :)2 theory for all |~u| < c.\nProof. According to Heifets and Osipov [28]\nHlr \u2212 Elr \u00b1 vPl \u2265 0,\n\n0 \u2264 |v| < c,\n\nwhere Pl is the momentum operator with periodic boundary conditions on a segment of\nlength l. This yields (4.54). Note that the ground state energy Elr is absorbed in H\u03c9 .\nIn fact, since H\u03c9 + ~uP~\u03c9 is the Lorentz rotated Hamiltonian, (4.54) may be expected in\ngeneral for rqft. Does it hold for its formal nrl? The answer is negative:\nProposition 4.5 The inequality (4.54) does not hold for the formal nrl of (: \u03c64 :)2 unless ~u = 0.\n\n10\n\n\fProof. The proof uses an idea of G.L. Sewell. Hln.-rel. is Galilean covariant: let\n(4.55)\n\nU\u039b\u00b1u\n= e\u2212i[tPl \u2213u(x1 +...xn)]\nl\n\ndenote the operator implementing Galilean transformations on L2 (\u039bl ) (with u =\nthen\n1\n(U\u039b\u00b1u\n)\u2217 Hln.-rel. U\u039b\u00b1u\n= Hln.-rel. \u00b1 uPl + nu2 ;\n(4.56)\nl\nl\n2\n(4.57)\nNow assume that\n(4.58)\n\n2\u03c0k\nl ,\n\nk \u2208 ZZ),\n\n(U\u039b\u00b1u\n)\u2217 Pl U\u039b\u00b1u\n= Pl \u00b1 nu.\nl\nl\nHln.-rel. \u2212 Eln.-rel. + vPl \u2265 0\n\nfor some v > 0. Let \u03a9\u039bl be the (unique) ground state of Hln.-rel. corresponding to the\neigenvalue Eln.-rel. , then\n(4.59)\nPl \u03a9\u039bl = 0.\nUsing now (4.56), (4.57) and (4.59) with u = \u2212v we obtain\n(4.60)\n\n1\n(U\u039b\u2212v\n)\u2217 (Hln.-rel. \u2212 Eln.-rel. + vPl )U\u039b\u2212v\n\u03a9\u039bl = \u2212 nv 2 \u03a9\u039bl ,\nl\nl\n2\n\nwhich contradicts (4.58). Note that the term on the r.h.s. of (4.60) depends on the group\nparameter v, and different v's would change the correction.\n\nRemark 4.1 The fact that (4.54) is broken in the nrl is a consequence of the singular\ncharacter of the limit c \u2192 \u221e, which is a group contraction (from the Poincar\u00e9 to the Galilei\ngroup, see E. In\u00f6n\u00fc and E.P. Wigner [29] and U. Cattaneo and the first named author [30]).\nIn fact, under the limit c \u2192 \u221e, the closed foward light cone {(t, ~x ) \u2208 IRs+1 | 0 \u2264 t \u2264 |~x |/c}\ntends to the positive time-axis {(t, ~0) \u2208 IRs+1 | t \u2265 0}. Thus it is conceivable that only\nthe vector ~u = ~0 remains in (4.58), and that is what Proposition 4.5 demonstrates. This\nhinges essentially on ignoring the Zitterbewegungsterm. The latter is also responsible for\nthe fact that the mass gap, proved in the full theory for s = 1 and small coupling in [31,\nTheorem 2.2.3], is made to vanish (at zero momentum) when performing the nrl. This has the\nconsequence that the stable vacuum leads to an unstable ground state in the nrl, according\nto Proposition 4.2.\n\n5\n\nConcluding Remarks and Open Problems\n\nA last important structural difference between vacua and ground states concerns the ReehSchlieder theorem. It has been proved by Requardt [32] that for a class of n-body nonrelativistic systems, states localized at time zero in an arbitrary small open set of IRn are\nalready total after an arbitrary small time - a statement which is much stronger than the\nwell known acausal behavior of non-relativistic theories. However, in contrast to rqft, in\nnon-relativistic theories annihilators of the vacuum are affiliated to the von Neumann algebra\nassociated to bounded regions in coordinate space.\nWhile the (smeared out) field operator of a relativistic theory is affiliated to the von\nNeumann algebra associated to a bounded space-time region, the (smeared out) creation\nand annihilation operators are not well-localized. Formally, the (time-zero) scalar field of\nmass m0 is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012 \u0012\nZ\n\u2212c~\np\nc~\np\n(5.61)\n+\na\n.\n\u03c6c (~x) = (2\u03c0)\u2212s/2 ds p~ e\u2212i~p~x a\u2217\n(2\u03c9c (~\np ))1/2\n(2\u03c9c (~\np ))1/2\n\n11\n\n\fIt is remarkable that the factor\n\nc\n(2\u03c9c (~\np ))1/2\n\nconverges to a constant as c goes to infinity. Consequently, the relativistic annihilation\noperators, which can not be localized in bounded space-time regions, are strictly localized in\na bounded space region at sharp time in the limit c \u2192 \u221e. This finding is in agreement with\nthe approximation of the non-local creation and annihilation operators by strictly localized\noperators in [33]. It is remarkable that the results in [33] provide bounds (in an appropriate\nnorm), which allow us to control this convergence quantitatively.\nIt is interesting to note that the proof of stability of the interacting (: \u03c64 :)3 theory\naccording to Definition 2.1 in, e.g., Ref. [9], makes use of Nelson's symmetry (see [34], [9]\nand references given there), which is itself a consequence of the Lorentz covariance of the full\nrqft. The latter depends crucially of course on keeping all particle-changing terms, including\nthose contributing to vacuum polarization, in the interaction. On the other hand, the result\nof Proposition 3 leads us to conclude that the formal nrl may lead either to a trivial theory or\nto an unstable one. This suggests that the elimination of particle-changing terms occurring\nwhile performing the nrl may introduce a nonphysical instability which is not present in the\nfull rqft. Since, for s = 2, there is no Thomas effect [18] (a special effect related to point\ninteractions), one might conjecture that this phenomenon could also take place in other\nsystems of greater physical relevance.\nIt should be, however, emphasized that a theory which fails to be thermodynamically\nstable should not be disregarded immediately. It merely shows that, given a set of initial\nconditions there is a tendency of the system to move out of the domain of validity of the\ntheory. This is a phenomenon well-known from classical general relativity, where the famous\nsingularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose show that for a large class of initial conditions,\nthe physical system develops, as a consequence of the basic thermodynamic instability, hot\nspots with energy densities which can no longer be described by classical Einstein gravity.\nIn fact, the \"\u03b4 (2) (~x )\"- interaction has arisen in discussions of point-particle dynamics in\n(2+1)-dimensional gravity [35].\nThe phenomenon of instability (nrl) / stability (rqft) is independent of neglecting the\n\"Zitterbewegungsterm\", because it would not be altered if we used instead the relativistic\nkinetic energy. Neglecting this term is, however, responsible for the singular nature of the\nnrl, and accounts for several instability results of a different nature for the resulting ground\nstates, as shown in Section 4.\nSince the mass or number operator is not conserved in rqft, the density cannot be fixed\nperforming the nrl. A major open problem is, thus, to consider the charged (: \u03c6\u03c6 :)2 -theory,\nand perform the nrl in a sector of fixed charge density.\n\nAcknowledgement W.F.W. would like to thank K.

However, the W \u2217 -version is elementary: \u2200t \u2208 IR, Ut = eitH\u03c9 \u2208 \u03c0\u03c9 (A)\u2032\u2032 (see [35, Theorem 3.5 for a simple proof]). Since H\u03c9 6= 0,\n(Ut \u2212 1l) = eitH\u03c9 \u2212 1l 6= 0 if t 6= 0, and (Ut \u2212 1l)\u03a9\u03c9 = 0.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\n[1]\n\nHunziker, W., On the nonrelativistic limit of the Dirac theory, Comm.
