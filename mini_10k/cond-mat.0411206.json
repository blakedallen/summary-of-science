These 1D \u2192 2D dimensional crossovers lead to delocalization of wave functions\nand are responsible for angular magnetoresistance oscillations. As an example, we show that\nsuggested theory is in qualitative and quantitative agreements with the recent experimental data\nobtained on (TMTSF)2 ClO4 conductor.\nPACS numbers: 74.70.Kn, 72.15.Gd\n\n1\n\n\fIt is well known that, in traditional \"three-dimensional\" metals with closed quasi-particle\norbits, quantum oscillations in a magnetic field occur due to Landau quantization of energy\nlevels [1]. Meanwhile, a number of low-dimensional organic metals with open [quasi-onedimensional(Q1D)] sheets of Fermi surfaces (FS) [2,3], where Landau quantization is not\npossible, demonstrate several types of unconventional angular oscillations [4-23] related to\nopen sheets of FS,\n\u01eb\u00b1 (p) = \u00b1vF (px \u2213 pF ) + 2tb f (py b\u2217 ) + 2t\u22a5 cos(p\u22a5 c\u2217 ) ,\n\npF vF \u226b tb \u226b t\u22a5 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere +(\u2212) stands for the right (left) sheet of the FS; vF and pF are Fermi velocity and Fermi\nmomentum along conducting x-axis, respectively; tb and t\u22a5 are the overlapping integrals\nbetween conducting chains [2,3]; h\u0304 \u2261 1.\nAmong these low-dimensional metals with Q1D sheets of FS (1), are (TMTSF)2 X (X =\nPF6 , ClO4 , ReO4 , ...) [8-19], (DMET)2 I3 [20], \u03ba-(ET)2 Cu(NCS)2 [21,22], (DMET-TTF)2 X\n(X = AuCl2 , ...) [23], and some other conductors. [For most Q1D conductors, one can\nuse f (py b\u2217 ) = cos(py b\u2217 ) in Eq.(1), with the important exceptions of (TMTSF)2 ClO4 and\n(TMTSF)2 ReO4 compounds [2,3]].\nAs was first recognized in theories of field-induced spin-density-wave phases in\n(TMTSF)2 X materials [24-27], in the absence of Landau quantization, Bragg reflections\nare responsible for quantum magnetic many-body phenomena in metals with open FS (1).\nMoreover, as shown in Ref.[4], at some Magic Angle (MA) directions of a magnetic field,\ntan \u03b1 = N (b\u2217 /c\u2217 ) , H = (0, H sin \u03b1, H cos \u03b1) ,\n\n(2)\n\nelectron trajectories in a reciprocal space become periodic. This leads to the existence\nof constructive interference effects [28,29] coming from Bragg reflections, which occur when\nelectrons move in a magnetic field along open Q1D sheets of FS (1) in the extended Brillouin\nzone. As a result, many-body angular oscillations in a magnetic field appear [4,5]. For\nextensions of the idea [4] to some model one-body phenomena, see Refs.[6,7].\nVery recently, it has been theoretically demonstrated [28-31] that the similar interference\neffects are able to account for nontrivial one-body phenomena - angular magnetoresistance\noscillations - experimentally observed in resistivity component \u03c1\u22a5 (H), perpendicular to conducting planes in (TMTSF)2 X [8-19] and \u03ba-(ET)2 Cu(NCS)2 [21,22] conductors. Note that\nthe existence of angular magnetic oscillations [4-23] is an a contradiction with common belief\nthat nothing important happens with open quasi-particles orbits (1) in a magnetic field and,\nas shown in Ref.[32], is a consequence of some non-trivial \"momentum quantization laws\".\nIn particular, in Refs.[28,29], a theory of angular magnetic oscillations in \u03c1\u22a5 (H) at MA\ndirections of a magnetic field (2) was suggested, whereas, in Refs.[30,31], theoretical de2\n\n\fscriptions of the so-called interference commensurate (IC) oscillations in \u03c1\u22a5 (H) [19,20,3335] were proposed. The IC magnetoresistance oscillations were also studied by numerical\nmethods [19,33,34]. As shown in Refs.[29,28], the physical meaning of MA oscillations (2)\nin \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b1) is related to the interference effects between velocity component perpendicular to the conducting (x, y)-planes, v\u22a5 (p\u22a5 ) = \u22122t\u22a5 c\u2217 sin(p\u22a5 c\u2217 ), and the density of states.\nThe IC oscillations are characterized by strong enough projection of a magnetic field on the\nconducting x-axis [19,20,33,34]:\nH = H(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6, + cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6, sin \u03b8) .\n\n(3)\n\nThis changes the physical meaning of the interference effects (see Ref.[30]), although minima\nin \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) appear exactly at MA projection [19,30,31] of the field (3) on (y, z)-plane,\ncorresponding to the following commensurate angles [30,31]:\nsin \u03c6 = n(b\u2217 /c\u2217 ) tan \u03b8 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere n is an integer.\nIndeed, as shown in Ref.[30], interference effects, responsible for the IC oscillations, occur\neven for constant value of density of states [i.e., for vF = const in Eq.(1)] and correspond to\nsummation of infinite number of electron waves coming from some \"stationary phase points\"\n[30] on electron trajectories in the extended Brillouin zone. Note that all existing theories of\nIC oscillations are developed for simplest Q1D spectrum with f (py b\u2217 ) = sin(py b\u2217 ) in Eq.(1)\nand, thus, are not applicable to such typical Q1D conductor as (TMTSF)2 ClO4 , where\n\u2217\n\nf (py b ) =\n\nq\n\ncos2 (py b\u2217 ) + \u22062 /4t2b ,\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u2206 being the so-called anion gap [2,3].\nThe main goals of our paper are as follows: 1) to calculate wave functions of a Q1D\nmetal (1) with arbitrary function f (z) in an inclined magnetic field (3), 2) to reveal novel\nphenomenon - a change of space dimensionality of these wave functions from 1D to 2D at\ncommensurate directions of a magnetic field (4), 3) to calculate \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) and to show that\nit exhibits minima at commensurate directions (4) due to the above mentioned 1D \u2192 2D\ndelocalizations of wave functions, 4) to demonstrate that these 1D \u2192 2D delocalizations\nmanifest themselfs as saturations of magnetoresistance \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6), 5) to show that the\nsuggested theory is in good agreement with the very recent experimental data obtained on\n(TMTSF)2 ClO4 [35].\nLet us discuss how 1D \u2192 2D delocalization crossovers can result in the appearance of\nminima in \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) using qualitative arguments. For electrons localized on conducting\nx-chains [4], resistivity component \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) is expected to be infinite in the absence of impurities (i.e., at 1/\u03c4 = 0) [1,7,28]. At 1/\u03c4 6= 0, it has to demonstrate quadratic non-saturated\n3\n\n\fmagnetoresistance, \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u223c H 2 \u03c4 , in accordance with general theory [1,7] in the case\nof open quasi-particles orbits (1). If, at commensurate directions of the field (4), electrons\nbecome delocalized, then \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) is expected to have similarities with resistivity of a\nfree electron at H = 0. Therefore, in this case, \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) has to saturate at high magnetic\nfields with the saturation values being expected to be proportional to 1/\u03c4 . Below, we demonstrate that this qualitatively different behavior of \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) at commensurate directions\n(4) is indeed responsible for the appearance of minima in \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) = 1/\u03c3\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6)].\nTo develop an analytical theory, we make use of the Peierls substitutions method for an\nopen electron spectrum [24,4,30]: px \u2212 pF \u2192 \u2212i(d/dx), p \u2192 p \u2212 (e/c)A, y \u2192 i(d/dpy ). We\nchoose the following vector potential for inclined magnetic field (3): A = (0, x sin \u03b8, x cos \u03b8\u2212\ny cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6)H, where Hamiltonian (1) in the vicinity of px \u2243 pF can be expressed as\nd\n\u03c9b (\u03b8)x\n\u03c9c (\u03b8, \u03c6)x\nd\n\u03c9\u0302c (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n\u01eb\u0302 (p) = \u2212ivF\n+2tb f py b\u2217 \u2212\n+2t\u22a5 cos p\u22a5 c\u2217 +\n,\n\u2212i\ndx\nvF\nvF\nvF\ndpy\neHvF b\u2217 sin \u03b8\neHvF c\u2217 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6\neHvF c\u2217 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6\n\u03c9b (\u03b8) =\n, \u03c9c (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n, \u03c9\u0302c (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n.\n(6)\nc\nc\nc\n+\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u0012\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\nIt is possible to prove that, if one represents electron wave functions in the form\n\u03a8\u01eb (x, py , p\u22a5 ) = exp(ipF x)\u03a8+\n\u01eb (x, py , p\u22a5 ) ,\n\n(7)\n\nthen solutions of the Schrodinger equation for Hamiltonian (6) can be written as\n2itb x\n\u03c9b (\u03b8)u\ni\u01ebx\nexp \u2212\ndu\nf py b\u2217 \u2212\nvF\nvF 0\nvF\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0013\u0015 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0014\n\u0012\n\u03c9c (\u03b8, \u03c6)u\n\u03c9b (\u03b8)u\n2it\u22a5 Z x\n\u2217\ncos p\u22a5 c +\n\u2212f [py ] du ,\n+ a f py \u2212\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\nvF 0\nvF\nvF\na = (2tb b\u2217 /vF ) .[\u03c9\u0302c (\u03b8, \u03c6)/\u03c9b (\u03b8)] ,\n(8)\n\n\u03a8+\n\u01eb (x, py , p\u22a5 ) = exp\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0013\n\nBelow, we demonstrate that suggested in the paper 1D \u2192 2D dimensional crossovers\ndirectly follow from Eq.(9). For this purpose, we calculate the real space z-dependence of\nwave functions along the inter-plane direction (i.e., at z = Nc\u2217 , where N is an integer plane\nindex) by taking a Fourier transform of the second exponential function in Eq.(9):\nd p\u22a5\nexp(ip\u22a5 Nc\u2217 )\n2\u03c0\n0\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0013\u0015 \u0013\n\u0014\nZ\n2it\u22a5 x\n\u03c9b (\u03b8)u\n\u03c9c (\u03b8, \u03c6)u\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\n+ a f py b\u2217 \u2212\n\u2212f [py b\u2217 ] du .\ncos p\u22a5 c\u2217 +\nvF 0\nvF\nvF\n\n\u03a6+ (x, py , z = Nc\u2217 ) =\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n(9)\n\nAfter straightforward calculations, Eq.

According\nto the theory of Bessel functions [36], JN (Z) is an oscillatory function of variable N at\nN < |Z|, whereas it decays exponentially with N at N > |Z|. Thus, one can conclude\nthat wave functions (11)-(13) are extended along z-direction if at least one of the functions\nIi (...)(i = 1, 2) in Eqs.(12),(13) is not restricted [i.e., if |Ii (M0 , py )| \u2192 \u221e as M0 \u2192 \u221e].\nIn the opposite case, where both functions Ii (...) (i = 1, 2) are restricted by conditions\n|Ii (M0 , py )| < Imax , wave functions (11)-(13) exponentially decay with the variable z at\n|z = Nc\u2217 | \u2265 4t\u22a5 c\u2217 Imax /vF .\nNote that functions (11)-(13) are written in the form of summations of infinite number of\nelectron waves corresponding to quasi-classical electron motion in different Brillouin zones.\nTherefore, the physical meaning of summations in Eqs.(12),(13) is related to the interference\neffects due to Bragg reflections, which occur when electrons move along open orbits (1) in a\nmagnetic field (3) in the extended Brillouin zone. As it is seen from Eqs.(12),(13), angular\ndependent phase difference between electron waves, 2\u03c0M\u03c9c (\u03b8, \u03b1)/\u03c9b(\u03b8), is an integer multiple of 2\u03c0 only at commensurate directions of a magnetic field (4), where \u03c9c (\u03b8, \u03b1) = n\u03c9b (\u03b1),\nwith n being an integer. Therefore, one can conclude that, at arbitrary directions of the field\n(3), the destructive interference effects in Eq.(11) result in exponential decay of wave functions (9),(10) perpendicular to conducting x-chains, whereas, at commensurate directions\n(4), the constructive interference effects de-localizes electron wave functions (9),(10).\nTo calculate conductivity \u03c3\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) within Fermi liquid approach for non-interacting\nquasi-particles (1), we introduce quasi-classical operator of the velocity component v\u22a5 in a\nmagnetic field [30]:\n\u03c9c (\u03b8, \u03c6)x\n\u03c9\u0302c (\u03b8, \u03c6)\nv\u0302\u22a5 (p\u22a5 , x) = \u22122t\u22a5 c sin p\u22a5 c +\n\u2212i\nvF\nvF\n\u0014\n\n\u2217\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2217\n\n\u0015 \u0012\n\nd\ndpy\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nand make use of Kubo formalism [7]. As a result, we obtain\n\u03c3\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u223c\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndz exp(z)\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n\ncos \u03c6\ndy\n(f [\u03c9b (\u03b8)\u03c4 z + y] \u2212 f [y]) .\ncos \u03c9c (\u03b8, \u03c6)\u03c4 z + a\n2\u03c0\ntan \u03b8\n(13)\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\nEq.(15) is the main result of our paper. Since in Q1D \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) = 1/\u03c3\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6),\nEq.(15) solves a problem to determine resistivity \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) for Q1D electron spectrum (1)\nwith an arbitrary function f (py b\u2217 ) [37]. Note that the existence of commensurate minima\n5\n\n\f(4) in \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) directly follows from Eq.(15). Indeed, the discussed above constructive\ninterference effects correspond to commensurability of two frequencies in Eq.(15), \u03c9c (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\nn\u03c9b (\u03b8), where n is an integer. Thus, integral (15) increases at commensurate directions of\nthe field (4) which leads to the appearance of minima in \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6).\nIt is possible to make sure that Eq.(15) predicts non-saturating magnetoresistance at high\nmagnetic fields for the case, where wave functions (11)-(13) are localized (see Fig.1). This is\nin accordance with general theory of magnetoresistance for open quasi-particle orbits [1,7].\nHere, we show that suggested in the paper 1D \u2192 2D dimensional de-localization crossovers\nmanifest themselves as saturations of magneto-resistance \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) at commensurate directions (4) of the field (3). For this purpose, we calculate \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) = 1/\u03c3\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6)\nas a function of H for commensurate angle (4) with N = 1 for the most common case,\nwhere f (py b\u2217 ) = cos(py b\u2217 ) in Eq.(1) [38]. As it is seen from Fig.1, de-localized electrons\nare characterized by unusual for open orbits (1) saturated behavior of magnetoresistence,\n\u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2192 const as H \u2192 \u221e. In Fig.2, we present a comparison of our theory with\nthe very recent measurements of \u03c1\u22a5 (H, \u03b8, \u03c6) performed on (TMTSF)2 ClO4 [35,38]. Fig.\n2 demonstrates that our Eq.(15) is not only in qualitative but also in good quantitative\nagreement with the experimental results [35,38].\nThis work was supported in part by National Science Foundation, grant number DMR0308973, the Department of Energy, grant number DoE-FG02-02ER63404, and by the INTAS grants numbers 2001-2212 and 2001-0791.
