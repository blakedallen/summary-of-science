The fitness or reproductive output of an\nindividual is not only linked to environmental conditions but\nalso tightly coupled to the type and frequency of its competitors. Evolutionary game theory [1, 2, 3, 4] has become\na powerful framework to investigate the evolutionary fate of\nindividual traits with differing competing abilities. Consider\na population of two types A and B. The fitness (or payoff)\nof the two types depends on their interaction partners and is\ndetermined by the payoff matrix\nA B\nA a b .\nB c d\n\n(1)\n\nTraditionally, the dynamics of such systems is investigated in\nthe context of the well-known replicator equation [2, 3, 4],\na deterministic differential equation describing the change in\nfrequency of the two (or more) types in infinite populations.\nFor two types, this results in four basic scenarios of coevolutionary dynamics [5], while complex dynamics can arise in\nhigher dimensions [6].\nIn nature, however, populations are finite in size and the\ndeterministic selection process is augmented and disturbed by\nstochastic effects and random drift. This has long been recognized by population geneticists and goes back to the seminal\nwork by Wright [7] and Fisher [8]. Assuming a finite but constant population size the balance between selection and drift\ncan be described by the Moran process [9]. The microscopic\ndynamics consists of three simple steps: (i) selection, an individual is randomly selected for reproduction with a probability proportional to its fitness; (ii) reproduction, the selected individual produces one (identical) offspring; (iii) replacement,\nthe offspring replaces a randomly selected individual in the\npopulation.\nThe Moran process allows to derive the fixation probability\nof mutant genes or investigate the effect of population structures on the fixation probability [10]. Originally, the Moran\nprocess was formulated in a frequency independent setting\nwhere the fitness of an individual is genetically determined\n\nand remains unaffected by interactions with other individuals\nas in Ref. [11]. Only recently, the frequency dependent approach of evolutionary game theory and the Moran process\nhave been successfully combined in order to investigate the\nevolutionary dynamics in finite populations [12, 13]. The fitness of an individual now comprises two components: the frequency independent baseline fitness which is associated with\ngenetic predisposition and the frequency dependent contribution from interactions with other members of the population.\nThus, evolutionary dynamics can be described by a continuous deterministic replicator equation or by a stochastic microscopic description of a birth-death process such as the Moran\nprocess. So far, the relation and transition between the two approaches remained unclear. We show that different replicator\ndynamics are associated with different microscopic processes\nand moreover that the dynamics derived for infinite populations may undergo qualitative changes in finite populations.\nIf every individual interacts with a representative sample\nof the population, the average payoff of A and B individuals\nwill be determined by the fraction of coplayers of both types.\nExcluding self interactions, this leads to the payoffs\na (i \u2212 1) + b(N \u2212 i)\n(2)\nN \u22121\nc i + d(N \u2212 i \u2212 1)\n\u03c0iB =\n,\nN \u22121\nwhere i is the number of A individuals and N is the population\nsize.\nThe effective reproductive fitness of an individual of type\nk is then given by 1 \u2212 w + w\u03c0ik where w determines the\nrelative contributions of the baseline fitness, which is conveniently normalized to one, and the payoffs result from interactions with other individuals [12]. Thus, w corresponds to the\nstrength of selection acting on the game under consideration.\nNote that any w < 1 can be mapped to a system with a different payoff matrix and w = 1 [14]. For the Moran process, the\nprobability that the number of A individuals increases from i\nto i + 1 is\n\u03c0iA =\n\nT + (i) =\n\n1 \u2212 w + w \u03c0iA i N \u2212 i\n,\n1 \u2212 w + w h\u03c0i i N N\n\n(3)\n\n\f2\nwhereas it decreases from i to i \u2212 1 with probability\n1 \u2212 w + w \u03c0iB i N \u2212 i\n.\n(4)\n1 \u2212 w + w h\u03c0i i N N\n\u0001\nh\u03c0i i = \u03c0iA i + \u03c0iB (N \u2212 i) /N is the average payoff in the\npopulation.\nNote that the selection mechanism in the Moran process requires perfect global information on the current state of the\npopulation. This is a very strong requirement and in many\nsituations undesirable. Therefore, we propose an alternative\nformulation for the microscopic processes entirely based on\nlocal information: In each time step, a randomly chosen individual b compares its payoff to the payoff of another randomly\nchosen individual a. It switches to the other's strategy with\nprobability\nT \u2212 (i) =\n\n1 w \u03c0a \u2212 \u03c0b\n,\np= +\n2\n2 \u2206\u03c0max\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03c0max is the maximum possible payoff difference and\n0 < w \u2264 1 measures the strength of selection. Note that in\ncontrast to the Moran process, the local update is invariant under linear rescaling of the payoff matrix. The transition matrix\nfor the number of A individuals in this process i is then given\nby\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni N \u2212i\n1 w \u03c0iA \u2212 \u03c0iB\n+\nT (i) =\n+\n2\n2 \u2206\u03c0max\nN N\n\u0012\n\u0013\nB\nA\n\u03c0\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n1\nw\ni N \u2212i\ni\ni\n+\n.\n(6)\nT \u2212 (i) =\n2\n2 \u2206\u03c0max\nN N\nIn both process, the number of A individuals remains constant\nwith probability T 0 (i) = 1 \u2212 T + (i) \u2212 T \u2212 (i). Further, the\nstates i = 0 and i = N are absorbing.\nWe can directly compute the probability that a single A individual fixates in the population, \u03c6A . In general, this probability is given by [15]\n\u03c6A =\n\n1+\n\n1\nPN \u22121 Qk\nk=1\n\nT \u2212 (i)\ni=1 T + (i)\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nIn the limit of weak selection, w \u226a 1, the fixation probabilities can be computed analytically [16]. The fixation probability for the Moran process is higher than for the local update\nmechanism if \u2206\u03c0max > 2.\nThe stochastic process can be formulated in terms of the\nmaster equation [17, 18]\nP \u03c4 +1 (i) \u2212 P \u03c4 (i) =\n\nP \u03c4 (i \u2212 1)T + (i \u2212 1) \u2212 P \u03c4 (i)T \u2212 (i)\n+P \u03c4 (i + 1)T \u2212 (i + 1) \u2212 P \u03c4 (i)T + (i)\n\nwhere P \u03c4 (i) is the probability that the system is in state i at\ntime \u03c4 . Introducing the notation x = i/N , t = \u03c4 /N and the\nprobability density \u03c1(x, t) = N P \u03c4 (i) yields\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c1 x, t + N \u22121 \u2212 \u03c1 (x, t) = \u03c1 x \u2212 N \u22121 , t T + (x \u2212 N \u22121 )\n\u0001\n+\u03c1 x + N \u22121 , t T \u2212 (x + N \u22121 )\n\u2212\u03c1 (x, t) T \u2212 (x) \u2212 \u03c1 (x, t) T + (x).\n\nFor N \u226b 1, the probability densities and the transition probabilities are expanded in a Taylor series at x and t. Neglecting\nhigher order terms in N \u22121 we get [17]\n\u0003\nd\n1 d2 \u0002 2\nd\nb (x)\u03c1(x, t) , (8)\n\u03c1(x, t) = \u2212 [a(x)\u03c1(x, t)] +\ndt\ndx\n2 dx2\nq\nwith a(x) = T +(x)\u2212T \u2212(x) and b(x) = N1 [T +(x) + T \u2212(x)].\nNote that, for large but finite N , this equation has the form of a\nFokker-Planck equation. Since the internal noise is not correlated in time as subsequent update steps are independent, the\nIt\u00f4 calculus [17] can be applied to derive a Langevin equation\n\u1e8b = a(x) + b(x)\u03be,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03be is uncorrelated Gaussian noise and b(x) = 0 for\nx = 0 and x = 1. The multiplicative noise term leaves the\nabsorbing nature of the boundaries unaffected. Qualitatively\nsimilar results are obtained by introducing noise in the payoff\nmatrix [19, 20]. In contrast, to account for stochastic effects\nthrough additive noise [21, 22] is problematic because of the\nboundaries of x.\nFor N \u2192 \u221e, the diffusion term b(x) vanishes with \u221a1N and\na deterministic equation is obtained. For the Moran process,\nthis yields\n\u0012 A\n\u0013\n\u03c0i \u2212 \u03c0iB i N \u2212 i\n(10)\n\u1e8b = lim\nN \u2192\u221e\n\u0393 + h\u03c0i i N N\n\u0001\n1\n= x \u03c0 A (x) \u2212 h\u03c0(x)i\n,\n\u0393 + h\u03c0(x)i\nwhere \u03c0 A (x) = x a + (1 \u2212 x)b, \u03c0 B (x) = x c + (1 \u2212 x)d, and\nh\u03c0(x)i = x \u03c0 A (x) + (1 \u2212 x)\u03c0 B (x). \u0393 = 1\u2212w\nw is essentially\nthe baseline fitness. Equation (10) is the adjusted replicator\ndynamics introduced in Ref. [3]; an alternative derivation for\nimitation dynamics is given in [23].\nFor the local update mechanism, we find\n\u0013\n\u0012 A\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0iB i N \u2212 i\n\u1e8b = lim w i\nN \u2192\u221e\n\u2206\u03c0max N N\n\u0001\nA\n= \u03bax \u03c0 (x) \u2212 h\u03c0(x)i ,\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03ba = \u2206\u03c0wmax is a constant factor influencing the\ntimescale only. Equation (11) is the standard replicator equation and represents the traditional approach to evolutionary\ndynamics in infinite populations [4]. The difference between\nthe two dynamics amounts to a dynamic rescaling of time\nwhich leaves the fixed points unchanged. Nevertheless, the\ndifferences in the microscopic updating can give rise to substantial differences in the macroscopic dynamics. To illustrate this, let us consider two famous examples: the Prisoner's\nDilemma [24] and Dawkins Battle of the Sexes [25].\nThe Prisoner's Dilemma describes the problem of cooperation where two players simultaneously decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D). Cooperation incurs costs c but produces a benefit b to the other player (b > c) whereas defection\n\n\f3\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nwith x(0) = x0 and x(t \u2192 \u221e) = x\u2217 = 1. The adjusted replicator dynamics can be solved only numerically for the given\npayoff matrix and general w. For w > 0, Fig. 1 illustrates that\nthe convergence to x\u2217 = 1 is faster for the adjusted replicator\ndynamics as compared to the standard replicator dynamics.\nDawkins Battle of the Sexes [25, 26] is a cyclic game referring to asymmetric conflicts in parental care: If males (|) are\nphilanderers (B| ), it pays for females (~) to be coy (A~ ), insisting on a long courtship period to make males invest more\nin the offspring. However, once most males are faithful (A| ),\nfast females are favored (B~ ) avoiding the costs of courtship.\nSubsequently, the male investment into the offspring is no\nlonger justified, philanderers are again favored (B| ), and the\ncycle continues. This is characterized by the payoff matrix\n\nA|\nB|\n\nA~\nB~\n(+1, \u22121) (\u22121, +1)\n(\u22121, +1) (+1, \u22121)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the first element is the payoff of the males and the second element is the payoff of the females [3]. Note that this\ngame is also called 'Matching Pennies' [22, 28].\nThe dynamics of Dawkins Battle of the Sexes is qualitatively different for the adjusted and the standard replicator dynamics [3]. Comparisons of the deterministic dynamics to the\ncorresponding stochastic process in finite populations reveal\nfurther interesting differences. For the standard replicator dynamics H = \u2212x(1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 y), where x is the fraction of\nfaithful males and y the fraction of coy females, is a constant\nof motion which measures the distance from the Nash equilibrium q = ( 12 , 12 ). Consequently, q is a neutrally stable fixed\npoint surrounded by periodic orbits. Figure 2 shows that this is\na spurious result valid only in the limit N = N~ = N| \u2192 \u221e.\nFor any finite N , \u1e22 > 0 holds and every trajectory spirals\naway from q. Note that in this case \u1e22 is approximated by\n\n5\n\n10-1\n\n10\nTime\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\nVariance\n\nwhere we added c in order to avoid negative payoffs. Figure\n1 compares the evolution from a state with a small fraction of\ndefectors into the evolutionary end state with defectors only.\nThe standard replicator dynamics for the Prisoner's Dilemma\nc\nis given by \u1e8b = w b+c\nx(1 \u2212 x), where x is the fraction of\ndefectors. The solution yields\ni\u22121\nh\n,\nx(t) = x0 x0 + (1 \u2212 x0 )e\u2212wtc/(b+c)\n\n(a)\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\nDeviation of mean\n\nD C\nD c b+c\nb\nC 0\n\n1.0\nFraction of defectors\n\nneither costs nor benefits anyone. In this game defection is\ndominant because defectors are better off no matter what the\nother player does. Thus, rational players end up with nothing\nrather than earning the more favorable payoff for mutual cooperation - hence the dilemma. The Prisoner's Dilemma is\ndetermined by the payoff matrix\n\n10-2\n10-3\n101\n\n102\n\n103\nN\n\n104 101\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\nN\n\nFIG. 1: Prisoners Dilemma: (a) Approach to the Nash equilibrium\nfrom an initial state with 10% defectors for simulations of the Moran\nprocess (\u25e6) and the local update rule (N) with N = 200 as compared to numerical solutions of the corresponding adjusted replicator\ndynamics (dashed line) and the standard replicator dynamics (solid\nline), respectively. The dynamics based on the Moran process converges much faster to the equilibrium state x\u2217 = 1. (b), (c) Convergence of the stochastic simulations (\u25e6, N) and the corresponding\nLangevin equations (dashed and solid lines) to the deterministic adjusted and standard replicator dynamics for increasing population\nsizes N . (b) Deviations of the mean fraction of defectors at time\nt1 (depicted in (a) by the arrows) where the corresponding (adjusted)\nreplicator dynamics predicts x(t1 ) = 0.5; (c) same for the variance\nof the mean fraction of defectors. The results for the simulations and\nthe Langevin equation are in excellent agreement. Both the deviations and the variance converge to the deterministic dynamics with\n1/N (dotted line), as expected (b = 1, c = 0.5, w = 0.9, time scale\nfor simulations 1/N , averages over 106 realizations).\n\nh\u2206Hi = hH(t + 1) \u2212 H(t)i, which is calculated for a single stochastic update step and averaged over many realizations. In contrast, the adjusted replicator dynamics leads to\n\u1e22 \u2264 0, where equality holds only at the Nash equilibrium q.\nH represents a Lyapunov function with q as the unique and\nasymptotically stable interior fixed point. Interestingly, for finite N , i.e. for the Moran process, the drift towards q changes\nsign: Below a critical population size Nc (w), q is unstable\nand the trajectories spiral towards the boundary. However, for\nN > Nc (w), q becomes stable, cf. Fig. 2. Similar qualitative\nchanges based on population sizes have recently been reported\nin Refs. [13, 29].\nIn conclusion, we presented a mathematically consistent\ntransition from descriptions of the microscopic processes relevant for individual based simulations over stochastic approximations of the dynamics in finite populations to a deterministic mean field theory governed by replicator dynamics. In particular, we have shown that the intrinsic stochasticity arising\nin finite populations can be captured by a Langevin term in the\nreplicator dynamics.

Both,\nthe microscopic processes and their stochastic approximation\nconverge with 1/N to the solution of the corresponding replicator equation.\nThe frequency dependent Moran process [12] is intimately\nconnected to the adjusted replicator dynamics [3]. Conversely,\nthe proposed local update rule corresponds to a finite population equivalent of the standard replicator dynamics [4]. While\nthe qualitative dynamics of the two approaches is the same,\nquantitative differences vanish only upon non-linear rescaling of time. However, for interacting (sub)populations, such\nrescaling is no longer possible and can give rise to entirely different qualitative dynamics. In particular, for Dawkins Battle\nof the Sexes, we have shown that, for the Moran process, the\nstability of the mixed Nash equilibrium depends on the population size such that it becomes unstable below a critical size\nand no mixed population can persist.\nJohn Maynard Smith asked whether the adjusted or the\nstandard replicator dynamics is more appropriate to describe\nevolutionary changes [3].
