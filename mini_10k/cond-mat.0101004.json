INTRODUCTION\n\nThe research on trions in 2D systems has shown many interesting results in recent\nyears1\u20134 . In a broader sense, the trion problem, not limited to 2D, is linked to the existence\nand the stability of negative hydrogen ion H\u2212 which has not only important implication for\natomic physics and astrophysics5 , but also vital application to other fields such as physical\nchemistry6 , accelerator engineering7 , and controlled fusion8 .\nIn a trion, or charged exciton, two electrons are bound to one hole despite the strong\nCoulomb repulsion between electrons. (Likewise two holes can be bound to one electron\nas well but the discussion that follows is the same if \"hole\" is switched with \"electron.\")\nIt is quite a marvel that the two electrons would not fall apart from the strong Coulomb\nrepulsion between them. More surprising is that the ground-state energy of such a complex\nis lower than that of an exciton, at least in the limit of heavy hole (i.e., the mass of the hole\nis much larger than that of electrons, which effectively results into the H\u2212 problem).\nFirst let us try to understand in terms of classical mechanics why trion forms despite the\nstrong Coulomb repulsion.\n\n2\n\n\fFIGURES\nNet attraction\nRepulsion\nfrom e 2\ne1\n\nHole\n\nAttraction from hole\na\n\ne2\na\n\nFIG. 1. Two electrons and a hole arrange themselves to form the bound state of trion in a\nclassical picture of electrodynamics. Arrows indicate forces. Electrons e1 and e2 are shown as the\nshaded circles.\n\nSuppose that two electrons are on two sides of one hole as shown in Fig. 1. The\nelectrostatic forces felt by electron 1 (e1) are from the hole and electron 2 (e2). Because\nthe forces are governed by the inverse square Coulomb's law, the repulsion exerted on e1 by\ne2 is only 1/4 that of the attraction given by the hole. Similar argument applies to e2 and\ntherefore these two electrons tend to come together to form a bound state in spite of the\nstrong repulsion among like charges. In order for electrons not to fall into the hole we can\nassume in a classical fashion that the electrons rotate around the hole in such a way that\nthe inward electrostatic force is balanced by the centrifugal force. In quantum mechanics\nsuch tendency of electron's coming together will be stopped by the penalty in kinetic energy\nwhich increases as a\u22122 , where a is roughly the average distance between the hole and one of\nthe electrons. Note that the gain in Coulomb energy varies at a slower pace approximately\nas a\u22121 so that it would be hard for the electrons to come near the hole without limit, if the\npossible electron-hole recombination is not taken into account. (The trion will not be stable\nif the recombination is spontaneous. We will discuss this problem further in Sec. VI.)\nTherefore the bound state of trion is not quite a surprise after all. It basically results from\nthe inverse square Coulomb's law and a favorable geometric configuration of two electrons\nand one hole.\n\n3\n\n\fII. THREE ELECTRONS AND ONE HOLE\n\nNow we want to take one step further to see if a similar physical picture generalizes to\nthe case of three electrons and one hole. In the heavy hole limit, this problem is in effect that\nfor the doubly charged negative hydrogen ion H\u2212\u2212 . There is a much celebrated theorem9,10\nby E. H. Lieb saying that H\u2212\u2212 is not stable against dissociation into H\u2212 and e\u2212 in vacuum.\nHere vacuum means that there is not any other charged particle nearby at finite distance\nexcept for the particles forming the H\u2212\u2212 ion. We need a few more words on this theorem. In\nLieb's original papers, a bound system is defined as an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. This\nis a strong condition, which leaves room for metastable states for H\u2212\u2212 . The existence of\npossible metastable states for H\u2212\u2212 is currently a highly debated issue11\u201315 . Lieb's theorem\neither does not rule out any possible H\u2212\u2212 state whose total energy is negative. Here the\nenergy zero is taken when particles are infinitely separated and thus with arbitrarily small\nkinetic and potential energy.\nIn this paper we study the bound on the ground-state energy of three electrons and one\nhole at close distance in 2D. Instead of having a heavy positive charge, we assume that the\nmasses of the four are all the same. Our result shows strictly that the ground-state energy\nis negative when the four particles are relatively localized one to another.\n\n4\n\n\fElectron 1\n\nElectron 2\n\nHole\n\nElectron 3\n\nThe complex is a boson and the total charge: \u2212 2 e\n\nFIG. 2. Three electrons and a hole arrange themselves to form a \"bound\" state in a classical\npicture. Arrows indicate forces. The dotted equilateral triangle is a guide to the eye, showing three\nelectrons at equal distance. The dash-dotted circle traces the orbit of electrons.\n\nBefore starting quantum mechanical calculation, we want to show in a classical picture\nwhy such a state of negative energy might be possible. In Fig. 2, three electrons are at\nthe vertices of an equilateral triangle, with one hole in the center. According to the simple\nknowledge of electrostatics, the force on the central hole is 0 while those on the electrons are\n\u221a\n( \u221a3\u22121)e2\n4 3\u03c0\u01eba2\n\ninwards to the center, where a is the distance between the hole and one electron.\n\nNot to make themselves fall into the hole the electrons may rotate around the hole in such a\nway that the inward electrostatic force is balanced by the centrifugal force, just as in a trion.\nIntuitively a four-body system with a net charge of \u22122e may not be stable because of the\nstrong Coulomb repulsion. However under the special geometry as shown, the peculiarity of\nCoulomb's law (an inverse square law) actually favors a bound state of 3 electrons and 1 hole\n(3E+1H), at least within the framework of classical electrodynamics. Thus these electrons\ntend to move to the hole, giving rise to an effective binding among them.\nNote that the total charge of such a complex is \u22122e which just reminds us of the Cooper\n5\n\n\fpair that brings in superconductivity, because the complex of four fermions (three electrons\nand one hole) is now effectively a charged boson.\nThe stability of such complex against electron-hole recombination or annihilation actually depends on the energy band structure of the host conductors. While electrons and\nholes recombine spontaneously in semiconductors, they coexist peacefully inside semimetals\nwithout destroying one another. The stability is governed by semi-metallic energy band\nstructures. We will deliberate on this later in Sec. VI.\nFor the purpose of convenience, let us introduce a new term, tetron, to refer to the 3E+1H\ncomplex, in a sense similar to the term trion. We will use tetron and 3E+1H interchangeably\nthereafter.\nOur strategy for this paper is as follows. We will first mention relevant 2D quantum\nmechanical results for the Coulomb potential in Sec. III. Then as a warm-up exercise we\ntry to find out the upper bound on the ground-state energy of a 2D trion in the heavy hole\napproximation, which is given in Sec. IV. Based on techniques developed for trions, we try\na few fully antisymmetrized wavefunctions in Sec. V to show that states of negative energy\nindeed happen to tetron.\n\nIII. QUANTUM MECHANICS OF AN ELECTRON IN 2D COULOMB\nPOTENTIAL\n\nThis problem has been worked out numerous times but we just repeat some relevant\nresults here for quick reference.\nThe Hamiltonian for an electron in a 2D Coulomb potential reads\nh\u03042 2\ne2\nH=\u2212\n\u2207 \u2212\n,\n2m\n4\u03c0\u01ebr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the permittivity, e the elementary charge and m the mass of the electron.\nWe try to solve the problem in a polar coordinate, where the gradient operator is given\nby\n6\n\n\f\u2207 = r\u0302\n\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\n+ \u03b8\u0302\n,\n\u2202r\nr \u2202\u03b8\n\n(2)\n\nwith the corresponding Laplacian\n\u2202\n1 \u22022\n1 \u2202\n(r ) + 2 2 .\n\u2207 =\nr \u2202r \u2202r\nr \u2202\u03b8\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation reads\n{\u2212\n\nh\u03042 2\ne2\n\u2207 \u2212\n}\u03a8 = E\u03a8.\n2m\n4\u03c0\u01ebr\n\n(4)\n\nWe want to simplify Eq. (4) by making it dimensionless. Note that h\u03042 /2m has a dimension of (energy)(length)2 while e2 /4\u03c0\u01eb is in (energy)(length). We select the units (or the\nenergy and length scales) so that both h\u03042 /2m and e2 /4\u03c0\u01eb are 1. Under such a convention\nlength will be measured in the unit 2\u03c0\u01ebh\u03042 /me2 while energy is measured in me4 /8\u03c0 2 \u01eb2 h\u03042 .\nThis unit system is summarized in Table I.\n\n7\n\n\fTABLES\nTABLE I.

UPPER BOUND ON GROUND-STATE ENERGY OF A 2D TRION\n\nWe take this problem as a warm-up exercise. This is a very illustrative example showing\nhow to balance between the Coulomb and kinetic energy. It also gives us some intuition in\nchoosing good trial wavefunctions and on how to deal with two-body Coulomb integrals. The\nbasic line of reasoning follows that of H.A. Bethe5 , E.A. Hylleraas16 and others17 . Although\nthere have been recent researches3,4 in the same direction, our methods in dealing with the\nintegrals are somehow different and hopefully easier to understand.\nFor the purpose of simplicity we take the mass of the hole as infinity. The Schr\u00f6dinger\nfor this problem is now clearly\n{\u2212\u220721 \u2212 \u220722 \u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 +\n}\u03a8 = E\u03a8.\nr1 r2 r12\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u220721 and \u220722 are respectively short-hands for\n\u2202\n1 \u22022\n1 \u2202\n(r1\n) + 2 2,\nr1 \u2202r1 \u2202r1\nr1 \u2202\u03b81\n\n(12)\n\n\u2202\n1 \u22022\n1 \u2202\n(r2\n) + 2 2.\nr2 \u2202r2 \u2202r2\nr2 \u2202\u03b82\n\n(13)\n\nand\n\nHere subscripts refer to electrons such that r1 , \u03b81 and r2 , \u03b82 are the coordinates of e1 and\ne2 respectively.\nWe choose the following trial wavefunction\n\u03a8 = exp[\u2212\u03bb(r1 + r2 )][1 + k(r1 \u2212 r2 )2 ],\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03bb and k are parameters to be determined later by variational principle. The first term\nin this wavefunction suggests that e1 and e2 are both in 1s states. Here 1s state are not\nexactly the \u03a8 1 ,0 given in Eqs. (10) but rather that with a screening constant \u03bb. The physical\n2\n\norigin of \u03bb is clear: the Coulomb field of the hole felt by one electron is reduced (screened)\nby the presence of the other. For this reason we also require that \u03bb be positive and smaller\nthan 1. The existence of the second term is to reduce the Coulomb interaction between e1\n9\n\n\fand e2. Note that this term is small when r1 and r2 are close which is another way of saying\nthat electrons 1 and 2 tend to avoid each other. So why not just keep the second term only?\nThe reason is that while this term is good for reducing the Coulomb energy it causes some\npenalty in kinetic energy when compared with the first one. Thus the viable solution is to\ncombine the merits of the two terms, which results in the trial wavefunction (14).\nTo facilitate our calculation we want better management on the trial wavefunction. Note\nthat functions like exp[\u2212\u03bb(r1 + r2 )] are not normalized and would be a headache for the\nalgebra and calculus to come. The solution is to generalize the eigenstates of Eqs. (10) to\naccommodate the screening effect. The first four solutions now read\n|1si =\n\ns\n\n2\n\u03bb exp(\u2212\u03bbr),\n\u03c0\n\n(15)\n\n|2si =\n\ns\n\n2\n2\n\u03bbr\n[\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb2 r] exp(\u2212 ),\n27\u03c0\n3\n3\n\n(16)\n\n|2p\u00b1 i =\n\ns\n\n\u03bbr\n4 2\n\u03bb r exp(\u2212 ) exp(\u00b1i\u03b8).\n243\u03c0\n3\n\n(17)\n\nwhere we have used notations 1s, 2s, and 2p\u00b1 in place of the cumbersome \u03a8. The meaning of\nthese symbols should be self-evident given a background knowledge of hydrogen eigenstates\nin three-dimension (3D). It is not hard to verify that these wavefunctions are now normalized.\nThe trial wavefunction is then instead written as\n\u03a8 = [1 + k(r1 \u2212 r2 )2 ]|1s1 1s2 i,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere |1s1 1s2 i = |1s1 i|1s2i stands for\ns\n\ns\n\n(19)\n\n2\n\u03bb exp(\u2212\u03bbr1 ).\n\u03c0\n\n(20)\n\n2\n2\n\u03bb exp(\u2212\u03bbr1 )\n\u03bb exp(\u2212\u03bbr2 ),\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\nand |1s1 i is the short-hand for\ns\n\nSimilarly we define |1s2 i.\nThis trial wave function is symmetric in the spatial coordinates and in order to make\nthe total wavefunction antisymmetric we only need to multiply \u03a8 by a spin singlet state\n10\n\n\fa\nS12\n=\n\n\u221a1 [|\n2\n\n\u21911 \u21932 i \u2212 | \u21931 \u21912 i] where the subscripts are electron indices with the superscript a\n\nindicating antisymmetry.

The trion is therefore more stable\nthan exciton and it forms spontaneously given one exciton and an extra electron.\nOur calculation shows that the trion binding energy in two-dimension > 0.08147 2D\nRydberg, larger than that of 3D one which is \u2248 0.055 3D Rydberg. This is not a surprise\nbecause it is well known that lower dimensionality favors the formation of bound states. As\na result, pure excitons in 2D have a binding energy 4 times as big as that in 3D.\nWe are so far confined to heavy hole limit. It is interesting to see quite some reports16,17,3,4\nshowing trion states more stable than those of exciton regardless of the electron-hole mass\nratio although the author of this paper have not obtained such results using a slightly\ndifferent but more rigorous Hamiltonian. Not reaching a low energy after a few trials in\nvariational methods does not rule out its actual existence and this problem will not be\nfurther probed here because it is off our main topic for this paper.

III , the\nHamiltonian is now\nH = \u2212(\u220720 + \u220721 + \u220722 + \u220723 )\n+(\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n).\nr12 r 23 r31 r10 r20 r30\n\n(51)\n\nWe introduce a new coordinate system\nr0 + r1 + r2 + r3\n,\n4\nr + r1 \u2212 r2 \u2212 r3\n,\nr1 = 0\n2\nr \u2212 r1 + r2 \u2212 r3\n,\nr2 = 0\n2\nr \u2212 r1 \u2212 r2 + r3\n,\nr3 = 0\n2\nr0 =\n\n(52)\n\nwhich are treated as vector transforms.\nThese transforms result into the following relations,\nr0 \u2212 r1 = r2 + r3 ,\nr0 \u2212 r2 = r3 + r1 ,\nr0 \u2212 r3 = r1 + r2 ,\nand\n18\n\n(53)\n\n\fr1 \u2212 r2 = r1 \u2212 r2 ,\nr2 \u2212 r3 = r2 \u2212 r3 ,\nr3 \u2212 r1 = r3 \u2212 r1 .\n\n(54)\n\nWith the transformed coordinate system in place, the Hamiltonian now takes a new\nform,\n1\nH = \u2212( \u220720 + \u220721 + \u220722 + \u220723 )\n4\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n).\n+(\nr12 r23 r31 r1+2 r2+3 r3+1\n\n(55)\n\nwhere for example\n\u220720 =\n\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\n1 \u22022\n(r0\n) + 2 2,\nr0 \u2202r0 \u2202r0\nr0 \u2202\u03b80\n\n(56)\n\nr12 =\n\nq\n\n(57)\n\nand\nr12 + r22 \u2212 2r1 r2 cos \u03b812 ,\n\nwhile r1+2 is the short-hand for |r1 + r2 | or\n\nq\n\nr12 + r22 + 2r1 r2 cos \u03b812 .\n\nr0 now refers to the center-of-mass (c.m.). After discarding the irrelevant first term on\nRHS of Eq. (55), we reduce the internal Hamiltonian in the c.m. frame to\nH = \u2212(\u220721 + \u220722 + \u220723 )\n+(\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n),\nr12 r23 r31 r1+2 r2+3 r3+1\n\n(58)\n\nwhich is effectively a three-body problem.\n\nB. Spin-singlet trial wavefunction of 1s, 2p+ , and 2p\u2212 states\n\nIt is easy to see that if the trial wavefunction for the three-body problem is antisymmetrized, the corresponding wavefunction for the our original four-body problem will be\nantisymmetric as well under the permutation of the original electron coordinates. Now we\nwant to see how to make a three-body antisymmetrized wavefunctions.\n19\n\n\fThe trial wavefunctions will be initially made only from the first four eigenstates for the\npurpose of simplicity.\n|1si =\n\ns\n\n2\n\u03bb exp(\u2212\u03bbr),\n\u03c0\n\n|2si =\n\ns\n\n2\n2\n\u03bbr\n[\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb2 r] exp(\u2212 ),\n27\u03c0\n3\n3\n\n|2p\u00b1 i =\n\ns\n\n4 2\n\u03bbr\n\u03bb r exp(\u2212 ) exp(\u00b1i\u03b8).\n243\u03c0\n3\n(59)\n\nwhich are copied from the previous section for quick reference here. As a notation convenience which will be extensively used later, we also define\n|2pi =\n\ns\n\n4 2\n\u03bbr\n\u03bb r exp(\u2212 ).\n243\u03c0\n3\n\n(60)\n\nNote that h2p|2pi = 1 although |2pi is not necessarily orthogonal to other eigenstates.\nWe now try to make an antisymmetrized wavefunction \u03a8 out of Eqs. (59). \u03a8 should\nsatisfy our main object, h\u03a8|H|\u03a8i/h\u03a8|\u03a8i < 0.\nThe nice symmetry property of the Hamiltonian (58) helps us rule out \u03a8 only made of s\nstates. To see this, we need to understand that the kinetic terms in Hamiltonian are positive\ndefinite, or h\u03a8| \u2212 (\u220721 + \u220722 + \u220723 )|\u03a8i/h\u03a8|\u03a8i > 0. Thus the only possibility left for a negative\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 r2+3\n\u2212 r3+1\n)|\u03a8i/h\u03a8|\u03a8i.\nenergy state is by a negative Coulomb term h\u03a8|( r112 + r123 + r131 \u2212 r1+2\n\nWe only need to consider terms like h\u03a8|( r112 \u2212\n\n1\n)|\u03a8i/h\u03a8|\u03a8i\nr1+2\n\nbecause the total Coulomb\n\nenergy is just three times as much because of the symmetry of \u03a8 in r1 , r2 , r3 . Now we show\nand exploit a further symmetry hidden in r12 and r1+2 .\nNote that\nr12 =\nr1+2 =\n=\n\nq\n\nr12 + r22 \u2212 2r1 r2 cos \u03b812 ,\n\nq\n\nr12 + r22 + 2r1 r2 cos \u03b812\n\nq\n\nr12 + r22 \u2212 2r1 r2 cos(\u03c0 + \u03b812 ).\n\n(61)\n(62)\n(63)\n\nBoth r12 and r1+2 are periodic in \u03b81 with a period 2\u03c0. By the same argument we made\nin Sec. IV for two-body Coulomb integrals, we can integrate with respect to \u03b812 and \u03b82 ,\n20\n\n\fboth from 0 to 2\u03c0. However r1+2 is identical to r12 except for a phase shift of \u03c0 in \u03b812 . Since\n1\ncos \u03b812 has a period of 2\u03c0 in \u03b812 , h\u03a8| r112 |\u03a8i/h\u03a8|\u03a8i would be equal to h\u03a8| r1+2\n|\u03a8i/h\u03a8|\u03a8i if\n\n\u03a8 does not have any angular dependency such as those given by pure s states. The total\nCoulomb energy would be 0 and we have no way whatsoever to obtain a negative energy.\nWe will give a more general theorem later and exploit similar properties to greatly simplify\nour calculation.\nSo one of the states chosen in \u03a8 has to be |2p+ i or |2p\u2212 i. From our trial-and-error\nexperience, we find that it is generally better to have two 2p states and one s state.\nAs the first trial we want to test wavefunctions made out of |1si, |2p+ i and |2p\u2212 i.\nBy using variational approach, we also want to investigate the spin structure of such\n3E+1H complex. Since there is no spin-orbit coupling term in the Hamiltonian, we need\nonly to specify the total spin of three electrons for any trial wavefunction. Basically there\nare two possible options for three electrons: either they are all lined up in the same direction\nor one of them is against the other two. The hole is also a fermion, whose spin tends to be\nopposite to at least one of the electrons. Thus the total spin of this complex is either 0 or\nh\u0304, corresponding to spin singlet or triplet states. We would consider this explicitly in our\ncalculation.\nFirst let us start with three orthogonal states |1s li, |2p+ \u2191i and |2p\u2212 \u2193i. The arrows\ndesignate spin states. The complex is now in a spin singlet state because the mixed spin\nwavefunction | li =\n\n\u221a1 |\n2\n\n\u2191i +\n\n\u221a1 |\n2\n\n\u2193i should combine with that of the hole to give a singlet\n\nfor one electron-hole pair. Writing | li also means that we do not care about the exact spin\nstate; it can be either up or down.\nThe corresponding Slater determinant is\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n|1s1 l1 i |2p+\n1 \u21911 i |2p1 \u21931 i\n\n1\n\u2212\n|1s2 l2 i |2p+\n2 \u21912 i |2p2 \u21932 i\n6\n\u2212\n|1s3 l3 i |2p+\n3 \u21913 i |2p3 \u21933 i\n\n21\n\n\fs\n\n=\n\n=\n\n+\n\u2212\n1 |2p2 \u21912 i |2p2 \u21932 i\n|1s1 l1 i +\n6 |2p+ \u2191 i |2p\u2212 \u2193 i\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\ns\n\ns\n\n+\n\u2212\n1 |2p1 \u21911 i |2p1 \u21931 i\n|1s3 l3 i \u2212\n6 |2p+ \u2191 i |2p\u2212 \u2193 i\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\ns\n\n+\n\u2212\n1 |2p1 \u21911 i |2p1 \u21931 i\n|1s2 l2 i\n6 |2p+ \u2191 i |2p\u2212 \u2193 i\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n1\n{|2p2 2p3 i{exp[i(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b83 )]| \u21912 \u21933 i \u2212 exp[i(\u03b83 \u2212 \u03b82 )]| \u21913 \u21932 i}|1s1 l1 i\n6\n+ |2p1 2p2 i{exp[i(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 )]| \u21911 \u21932 i \u2212 exp[i(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b81 )]| \u21912 \u21931 i}|1s3 l3 i\n\u2212 |2p1 2p3 i{exp[i(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b83 )]| \u21911 \u21933 i \u2212 exp[i(\u03b83 \u2212 \u03b81 )]| \u21913 \u21931 i}|1s2 l2 i},\n\n(64)\n\nwhere for example l1 indicates a mixed spin state for electron 1 while 2p+\n2 says that electron\n2 is in a 2p+ state and so on so forth. Subscripts 1, 2, and 3 as usual are electron indices.\nThere will be 6 terms in this antisymmetrized trial wavefunction, which would render\nfollow-on manipulation difficult.

STABILITY AGAINST ELECTRON-HOLE RECOMBINATION\n\nThe stability of a trion or a tetron against electron-hole recombination or annihilation actually is not a concern if the electrons and holes are from semi-metallic band-edge. Whether\nelectrons (e) and holes (h) should recombine or not depends on the band structure. Here we\njust give a very simple example: semimetals. Electrons and holes coexist peacefully without\nannihilating one another, in semimetals18 such as Bi, As, Sb.

Mechanism for the stability of electron-hole pairs. (a) Typical band structure for semiconductors. Electron states have higher energy than hole states. As a result, electrons recombine\nwith holes in a short time. This reasoning also applies to metal provided the relevant conduction\nband is partly filled. (b) and (c) Band structures of semimetals. Electron states have lower energy\nthan hole states and the recombination of electrons and holes is unfavored in energy. In all figures,\nEF is the Fermi energy.\n\nIn typical semiconductors, the conduction and valence bands are separated by a positive\nenergy gap as shown in Fig. 4(a). By jumping from the conduction to the valence band which\nis at a lower energy (i.e., recombining with a hole), the thermally excited electron lowers\nits energy. This process thus occurs spontaneously to the e-h pair and makes it unstable.\n(The same process can be interpreted as a hole jumping up and note that in contrast to\nelectron, the higher is the hole in the band diagram, the lower is its energy.) For semimetals\nwith different band configurations, as typified in Fig. 4(b) and (c), the situation is however\ntotally different. If the electron were to jump to the hole state and then recombine, as\n32\n\n\findicated by the arrows, it would have to take extra energy to reach there. This process\nis clearly unfavorable in energy and such a mechanism secures the stability of electron-hole\nliquid against recombination in semimetals. Thus we expect the proposed tetrons to find\ntheir best playing ground in solids with semi-metallic band structures.\n\nVII. STABILITY AGAINST DISSOCIATION\n\nAs mentioned before a tetron is not stable against the dissociation of one of its electrons\ninto infinity in vacuum. To understand this, let us perform a thought experiment. The\ntheorem by Lieb states that the ground-state energy of a 3E+1H complex must be higher\nthan that of a trion plus an electron which is assumed to be infinitely far away, having\narbitrarily small kinetic energy. Thus after we place a quasi-bound state of 3E+1H in\nvacuum, the complex tends to lower its energy by moving one of the electrons away to\nminimize the energy. This corresponds to the dissociation (detachment) of one electron as\nshown in Fig. 5.\n3 electrons + 1 hole complex\n(tetron) in vacuum\n\nDissociation into a trion and an electron\n\nThis electron\nmoves to infinity\nTrion\n\nFIG. 5. The reason why tetron (3E+1H) is not stable in vacuum.\n\nHowever if the tetron is not in vacuum, for example, if many other electrons and holes\nare present nearby, then there is hardly any gain in energy for the whole system even if an\nelectron dissociates from one tetron; this electron would simply increase Coulomb energy\nwith other electrons anyway even if it decreases the energy of the original tetron as shown in\nFig. 6. Such cases may happen to condensed matter systems where charge carrier densities\n33\n\n\fare governed by electronic structure, or some types of external controls such as dopings. The\nelectrons cannot leave the holes for infinity because statistically there must be some electrons\nclose to the holes. When the densities of electrons and holes are low, the situation is more like\na vacuum and therefore tetrons are not stable. With an increasing charge density, however,\nthe story could be increasingly different. Then if the densities exceed a certain threshold,\nthe whole system would lower its energy by taking advantage of the favorable geometric\nconfiguration offered by tetrons, provided the electrons outnumber holes by a ratio near\nor higher than 3. Then the tetron would be more stable in this high density electron-hole\nliquid. Actually Nature may have already suggested a similar mechanism for us: doubly\ncharged negative ions until recently have not been seen in gas phase, or in isolation. In\ncontrast, they have long been known to exist in condensed matter systems such as liquids\nand solutions19 .\nIf the densities are to further increase by too much, the energy of the tetron state will\nno longer be negative after a second threshold. The reason is simple, the gain in Coulomb\nenergy increases as a\u22121 while the penalty paid for the kinetic energy scales as a\u22122 , where\na is the average distance between particles. Then we would see a system close to ordinary\nmetal because the quasi-bound state is no longer possible.\nHere we just give the above qualitative argument to show how tetron states might be\nmaterialized. Further studies are needed in a more quantitative and rigorous way.\n\n34\n\n\f?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\nWhere to dissociate? The electron cannot move to infinity.\n\nFIG. 6. The reason why tetron (3E+1H) could be stable in the electron-hole liquid system.\n\nVIII. POSSIBLE CONNECTION TO HIGH-TC PAIRING MECHANISM?\n\nThe tetron state acts in a whole as a boson because it starts with 4 fermions. This\nis significant because the net charge is \u22122e (2e if we start with 3h+1e which is a more\nrealistic scenario for most copper-oxide superconductors), and we are now left with a Cooper\npair in effect. Moreover our current variational result implies a singlet state for the spin\npart of wavefunction, which is exactly what has been found in the Cooper pairs of high-Tc\nsuperconductors23 . This entices us into the possible connection between the tetron state\nand high-Tc superconductivity, although this model itself could be oversimplified without\nconsidering the crystal structure of the host material.\nCharged fermion pairing models based on exchange of excitons have been proposed before\nby some notable theorists20,21 , often in a paradigm of perturbative approaches. What we\nhave developed here could be a non-perturbative way of treating similar problems.\nHigh-Tc superconductivity found in copper oxides or cuprates are likely from the BoseEinstein condensation of pre-formed pairs22 . In this regard, the tetron complex reasonably\nfits into such a picture, with its small size comparable to the coherence length of cuprate\n\n35\n\n\fCooper pairs. Also high-Tc is intimately related to low dimensionality. Recall that the\nground-state energy of a 2D exciton is four times as low as that in 3D, while Tc decreases in\ncuprates when the superconductors are increasingly doped from a 2D conductor to 3D one.\nThere are mounting evidences showing the coexistence of electrons and holes in cuprate\nsuperconductors from key experiments such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy24\nand transport properties25,26 . Finally the qualitative discussion given in Sec. VII actually\nquite fits to the doping-dependent phase diagram of cuprate superconductors from underdoping to overdoping. Although the case at this moment is far from certain, the author\nsincerely hopes that this paper may generate some interests along this line of reasoning.\n\nIX. CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, various trial functions for 3E+1H complex (tetron) were worked out by\nrigorous variational method to give an upper limit on the ground-state energy. The calculation suggests quasi-bound states for such a complex. The possible connection of such states\nto a pairing mechanism of high-Tc is discussed.\n\n36\n\n\fREFERENCES\n1\n\nK.
