More precisely, when\nan applied electric field displaces the magnetic ions of\nthe multiferroic this affects the magnetic exchange coupling or, vice versa, the external magnetic field, H, induces Pi \u223c \u03b1ij Hj , where \u03b1ij is the magnetoelectric\n(ME) tensor and (i, j) = x, y, z. When \u03b1 is sufficiently\nstrong this phenomenon may allow to store information\nin nanometer-sized memories with four logic states2\u20134 .\nThe classification of multiferroics is based on different mechanisms of induced polarity5 . The type-I class of\nmultiferroics contains numerous perovskitelike materials\nin which P appears at higher temperatures than magnetism. In these materials, P and M weakly interact\nwith each other and, therefore, \u03b1 is marginal there. In\ntype-II MF, such as TbMnO3 , ferroelectricity is driven by\nthe electronic order degrees related to a spin-orbit mechanism in conjunction mostly with the spin-spiral magnetic\narrangement via the Dzyaloshinskii-Moria antisymmetric\nexchange. The latter creates P \u223c rij \u00d7 [Si \u00d7 Sj ], where\nrij is the vector connecting neighboring spins Si and Sj .\nSome of the type-II MFs may disclose a relatively large\nME coupling. However, their ferroelectricity is caused by\na particular type of magnetic order, which exists only at\nlow temperature and which is predominantly antiferromagnetic.\nStudies based on density functional theory (DFT) have\nsignificantly contributed to this rapidly developing field\nof multiferroics7 . For instance, calculations from firstprinciples predict that the ME effect appears when a meV\nvoltage is applied across the interface between the two\nunlike terminations, such as SrRuO3 /SrTiO3 8 . The interface ME effect might be intrinsically enhanced by the\nuse of material with high spin polarization. Indeed, a\nmore robust scenario of magnetoelectricity occurs in epitaxially grown two-phase MF consisting of ferroelectric\nand ferromagnetic components. Ab initio calculations\nsuggest that chemical bonding at the Fe/BaTiO3 (001)\n\ninterface is the source of strong ME coupling9,10 . Moreover, for the two opposite directions of P (P\u2193 and P\u2191 ),\nthere are rather noticeable differences of 0.1\u20130.2\u03bcB in the\nmagnetic moments of interfacial Fe and Ti. This is a very\npromising phenomenon, which is entirely confined to the\nferroelectric/ferromagnetic interface. The interface ME\neffect9 defines the change in M at the coercive field Ec :\n\u03bc0 \u2206M \u2248 \u03b1Ec .\n\n(1)\n\nFor Fe/BaTiO3(001), the estimated10 \u03b1 of \u223c2\u00d710\u221210 G\ncm2 /V is two orders of magnitude larger than that predicted for SrRuO3 /SrTiO3 .\nCurrently, ab initio calculations which explore the\ntrends and basic physics of magnetoelectrics, go ahead\nof experiment.\nFor a single Fe monolayer (ML)\non BaTiO3 (001), DFT predicts that perpendicular\nanisotropy is favored to in-plane anisotropy by 0.7 meV\n(0.5 meV) per Fe atom for P\u2193 (P\u2191 )10 . Although the spin\nreorientation transition under switching of P is not found\nfrom first principles, the ME coupling alters the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy by \u223c50%. The magnetic order of Fe/BaTiO3 can be tuned by the Fe layer\nthickness to almost zero-M ferrimagnetic upon deposition of a second Fe ML10 . Ferromagnetic order is restored for the Fe films thicker than 3 ML where the shape\nanisotropy energy favors in-plane alignment of M11 . Epitaxial growth of the two-phase MF thin films of high\nquality continues to be very challenging. A 30-nm thick\nFe(001) film has been grown recently on a ferroelectric\nBaTiO3 (001) substrate12 . For this composite MF, the\ntrends of magnetic anisotropy are in good agreement\nwith the corresponding ab initio calculations10,11 . Until recently, the DFT studies of the interface ME coupling were focused on chemically perfect films and superlattices with no impurities. Modeling the two different Fe3 O4 /TiO2 /BaTiO3 (001) interfaces, within the\nDFT, Niranjan et al.13 have found that ME coupling\nis stronger for the O-deficient type of the Fe3 O4 interface. Therefore, the presence of extra oxygen or oxygen\nvacancies at the biferroic interface plays an important\nrole. The effect of iron oxidation on the ME coupling of\nFe/ATiO3 (001) (A=Ba, Pb) was simulated14 from first\nprinciples for oxygen coverages ranged between 0.5 and\n\n\f2\n2.0 adsorbed O atom per Fe atom. The calculations suggest that the magnetic properties of the Fe monolayer are\ngradually degraded with increasing O coverage. However,\nthe change in magnetization which is induced by the P\nreversal remains robust. Thus, the surface oxidation of\ncomposite MFs cannot destroy their potentially switchable magnetoelectricity.\nIt is well known that both the magnetic order of Fefilms and the related magnetic anisotropy are very sensitive to the presence of some other 3d elements. The\nalloying effect may result in important changes in magnetoelectricity and therefore, the DFT based modelling of\nchemical order in composite multiferroics would be useful. The effect of Fe-Co alloying on magnetoelectricity\nof thin-film Fe/BaTiO3(001) has been studied recently15\nfrom first principles using the coherent-potential approximation to DFT. It was found that the presence of >0.25\nCo at.% per Fe atom stabilizes the ferromagnetic order in\nthe two-ML thick and magnetically soft Fe-films. In this\nwork, we investigate the ME coupling in the 1-ML and 2ML thick Fe on BaTiO3 (001) (BTO), with a CrO2 interfacial layer instead of TiO2 . Chromium dioxide (CrO2 ) is\nan experimentally proven half metal, which shows a Curie\ntemperature of 392 K and which possesses the largest\nspin polarization so far reported for this class of materials. As a consequence of the half-metallic feature of CrO2\n, the occupied Cr 3d bands are fully spin polarized, leading to the spin moment of 2 \u03bcB per formula unit. Now\nwe explore whether such a CrO2 -terminated interface of\nBTO enhances the ME coupling in FeL /BTO(001). In\nparticular, for L = 2 we observe a dramatic change of\nmagnetization in the topmost Fe ML under polarization\nreversal.\n\nII.\n\nMETHOD\n\nTo model the FeL /BaTiO3 (001) biferroic system\nwithin a slab geometry we used a 5-unit-cell (\u223c2-nm)\nthick BTO supercell covered by an Fe monolayer or Fe bilayer (L =1,2). A 2-nm-vacuum layer separates the slabs\nalong [001]. For tetragonal BTO the equilibrium lattice\nparameters a =3.943 \u00c5 and c/a =1.013 were used. The\nFe positions and atomic positions of the two top BTO\nunit cells were relaxed. In ferroelectric BTO, the cations\nand O of the alternating BaO and TiO2 layers are displaced against each other in the [001] direction. This\nleads to spontaneous polarization along [001]. Here we\nmodel a dually polar ferroelectric. If the BTO cations\nare placed above O in the supercell then the negative intralayer displacements \u03b4 = (zO \u2212 zcation ) < 0 form the\nP state pointing parallel to the surface normal (P\u2191 ) and,\nvice versa, the state P\u2193 means that the \u03b4 > 0. Before relaxation, the \u03b4 values of 0.082 \u00c5 and 0.086 \u00c5 were chosen\nin the TiO2 and BaO layers, respectively16 . The TiO2 terminated type of the BTO interface was energetically\npreferred16 . In this work, we substitute an interfacial Ti\nby Cr and added one or two ML of iron on the CrO2 -\n\nFIG. 1: Top layers of the (Fe2 )L=2 /CrO2 /BaTiO3 (001) unit\ncell are shown as side- and top view in the panels (a) and (b),\nrespectively. In panel (b), the interfacial Fe atoms above O\nare marked as \"FeO \" while the Fe atoms of the second ML,\nwhich sit above the perovskite cations are marked with the\nlabels \"FeBa \" and \"FeX \".\n\nterminated BTO(001). The Fe adatoms of the first ML\nrelax atop oxygen10 , while the Fe atoms of the second\nML find their relaxed positions above the Ba and X=Cr\nsites. In Figure 1, we plot the side- and top view of relaxed FeL /CrO2/BTO(001) for the case of L = 2. The\npositions of Fe above O, Ba and X are indicated by the\ncorresponding labels in the panel (b).\nIn this DFT based study we used the Vienna Ab\ninitio Simulation Package (VASP)17\u201319 within the local spin-density approximation. The electron-ion interactions were described by projector-augmented wave\n(PAW) pseudopotentials20 , and the electronic wave functions were represented by plane waves with a cutoff energy of 650 eV. For ionic relaxation the 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 4 k-point\nMonkhorst-Pack21 mesh was used. The ionic relaxation\nwas performed until the forces were less than 1 \u00d7 10\u22123\neV/\u00c5. To calculate the electronic density of states (DOS)\nwe used the 30 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 15 k-point mesh. For each completely relaxed atomic configuration we performed the\nspin-polarized calculations starting form the ferromagnetic (FM) or, alternatively, from the antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) configuration in the Fe layers. The induced magnetization of the XO2 interface was as well investigated.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nMuch effort has been recently put to show that the\nelectric field-induced reversal of P is able to vary the\neasy direction of magnetization in magnetically soft\nCo0.9 Fe0.1 22 and Ni0.78 Fe0.22 permalloy23 attached to\nthin film of multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) or, alternatively,\nto a single crystal of BiFeO3 .

The interfacial layer\nand layers beneath are denoted in Fig. 2 by I, I-1, I-2,\netc. The asymmetry of \u03b4 seen between P\u2193 and P\u2191 for the\nlayers I, I-1 and I-2 as well as the magnitude of \u03b4, which\ngradually decreases towards the interface, both mimic the\neffect of the depolarizing field and its screening. It should\nbe noted that the state P\u2193 is energetically preferred compared to P\u2191 . For that reason the depolarization effect\nis rather strong for P\u2191 as shown in Fig.2. For P\u2193 , the\nvalue of \u03b4 is stable beneath the interface, namely, between the layers I-1 and I-3 and, therefore, the reduction\nof \u03b4 becomes crucial at the interface only. It turns out\nthat interfacial CrO2 obeys marginal \u03b4, which value decreases when the second Fe ML is added. For P\u2191 , the\neffect of X=Cr on \u03b4 is more pronounced. For instance,\nwhen L = 2 and P = P\u2191 the presence of Cr changes the\nsign of \u03b4 in layer I.\nIn Figure 3, we plot the relaxed distances between interfacial Fe and O atoms of XO2 (X = Ti, Cr). It has\nbeen previously found from first principles that the TiO2\ntermination of BTO(001) is energetically preferred16 .\nWhen the first Fe ML is deposited on TiO2 /BTO(001)\nthe Fe atoms find their relaxed positions above O10 at\nthe distance dI+1,I \u22481.78 \u00c5 as shown in the left panel\nof Fig. 3. Thus, Fe and O form a strong and relatively\nshort chemical bond at the interface. Our calculations\ndemonstrate that dI+1,I may increase by \u223c5 % when\nthe second Fe ML is added. The polarization reversal\nshows no effect on dI+1,I . For L = 1 and the CrO2 interface, we find that the corresponding dI+1,I \u22481.7 \u00c5\nis significantly reduced compared to the Fe/TiO2 /BTO\nsystems. When the Fe-(I+2) layer is added for X=Cr and\n\ndI+1,I (\u00c5)\n\nA.\n\nP\u2193\n\n0.09\n\n\u03b4 (\u00c5)\n\never, to form a ferroelectric single domain in the (001)\nplane of BFO. As a result, the magnetization of permalloy could not be completely switched. We suggest that\nBTO is a more promising material for switching M by\nan electric field in the FM layer. In our study of the 1ML-thick Fe-electrode material deposited on BTO(001)\nwe find that the two systems: FeL=1 /TiO2 /BTO and\nFeL=1 /CrO2 /BTO are both ferromagnetically ordered,\nwhile the ME coupling coefficient increases from \u03b1 =\n2.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 G cm2 /V in FeL=1 /TiO2 /BTO to the value\nof 7.2\u00d710\u221210 G cm2 /V at the CrO2 interface. Eq.(1) was\nused to estimate \u03b1. In the case of Fe bilayer, the magnetic\norder changes dramatically. The FeL=2 /TiO2 /BTO system is almost zero-M ferrimagnetic for the both P states.\nContrarily, FeL=2 /CrO2 /BTO changes its magnetic order from AFM to FM when the substrate polarization is\nswitched from P\u2193 to P\u2191 , resulting in a ME coupling coefficient of \u03b1 = 6 \u00d7 10\u22128 G cm2 /V.

For L = 2, the distances dI+2,I+1 between\nthe topmost FeX /FeBa sites and the Fe-(I+1) layer are shown\nin the right panel. Each system is dually polar.\n\nP\u2191 , the separation between Fe and O is increased to the\ncorresponding X=Ti value. For the opposite polarization\nP\u2193 and L = 2, a \u223c5 %-increase of dI+1,I was obtained.\nThe latter result suggests a very promissing scenario of\nmagnetoelectricity in the FeL /CrO2 /BTO system with\nL = 2. Since the Fe-(I+2) atoms of the second layer are\ninevitably placed above the perovskite cations, the corresponding FeX and FeBa sites are nonequivalent as shown\nin Fig. 1. In Fig. 3(b) we plot the relaxed interlayer separation dI+2,I+1 between the Fe layers I+2 and I+1 for\nthe case of L = 2. In general, the presence of Cr at the\ninterface makes dI+2,I+1 larger compared to the reference\nFeL /TiO2 /BTO system but, most importantly, dI+2,I+1\nis not changed upon P reversal, exept for a 3 %-increase\nat the FeT i site.\n\n\f4\nin \u03b1 = 7.2\u00d710\u221210 G cm2 /V, which is three times larger\nthan the ME effect of FeL=1 /TiO2 /BTO.\n\nDOS (states/eV)\n\nFig. 4 shows the site-projected DOS of paraelectric\ncubic BaTiO3 together with the DOS of hypothetic cubic BaCrO3 . The two perovskites were calculated using\nthe same lattice parameter a = 3.943 \u00c5. For BTO we obtained an insulating band gap of \u223c2 eV, which is typically\nunderestimated within the local density approximation.\nThe conduction band of BTO is formed mainly by the\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\ntotal\nO\nCr\nBa\n\nBaCrO3\n\nX=Cr\n\n(eV)\n\nElectronic and magnetic properties\n\nEAFM \u2212 EFM\n\nB.\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\nFM\nAFM\nL=1\n\nBaTiO3\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nL=2\n\nL=1\n\nL=2\n\nFIG. 5: Energy difference \u2206E = EAF M \u2212 EF M between the\nAFM and FM configurations of FeL /XO2 /BTO (X=Cr,Ti\nand L = 1, 2) is normalized per Fe atom.\n\ntotal\nO\nTi\nBa\n-6\n\nP\u2191\nP\u2193\n\nX=Ti\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nE\u2212EF (eV)\nFIG. 4: The total and site-projected DOS of cubic BaTiO3\nand hypothetic BaCrO3 calculated using the same lattice parameter a = 3.943 \u00c5.\n\nTi 3d states whereas the upper valence band is largerly\ncomposed by the O 2p states. In BaCrO3, the DOS is\ntypically metallic while the 3d states of Cr dominate near\nthe Fermi level, EF . There is a marginal pseudogap seen\nat -1.5 eV below EF . Therefore, one can expect relatively\nstrong metallization at the Fe/CrO2 interface compared\nto Fe/TiO2 .\nIn FeL=1 /TiO2 /BTO the FM order is energetically\nfavorable against the AFM solution by 0.7 eV/cell\n(0.75 eV/cell) for P\u2191 (P\u2193 ). Here, the Fe and O magnetic\nmoments are aligned parallelly whereas the Ti magnetic\nmoment, originating from hybridization of the Ti 3d and\nFe 3d minority states9 , is antiparallelly aligned. All magnetic moments of the system are collected in Table I. The\npolarization reversal from P\u2193 to P\u2191 yields the magnetization change |\u2206M | = 0.028 \u03bcB /cell which formally results\nin the ME coupling of 2.1\u00d710\u221210 G cm2 /V. When Cr\nsubstitutes Ti at the interface, the lowest-energy configuration remains ferromagnetic. However, the negative\nmagnetic moment of \u223c2 \u03bcB , induced on Cr, is much\nlarger than mT i . For interfacial oxygen the calculated\nmagnetic moment is about 0.1 \u03bcB . This value as well\nas mCr are in a good agreement with the experimental\ndata of bulk CrO2 24 . Due to the large and negative Cr\nmagnetic moment, the total magnetization of the system\nFeL=1 /CrO2 /BTO is reduced by \u2248 2 \u03bcB in comparison to\nthat of FeL=1 /TiO2 /BTO. Although mCr is moderately\nchanged by P reversal the corresponding |\u2206M | results\n\nThe second Fe ML deposited on the TiO2 -terminated\nBTO(001) interface causes a specific case. There are two\ninequivalent I+2 sites situated atop Ba and Ti, respectively, which are labelled by FeBa and FeX in Fig. 1.\nThe different magnetic moments reflect the neighbourhood of these atoms such as their atomic volumes and\nhybridization of the electronic states. Let us consider,\nfirst, the case of X=Ti. The value of mF e in the layer\nI+1 is almost quenched while the two sizable moments\nin the surface layer I+2 are antiparallelly aligned. This\nresults in M \u2192 0 for FeL=2 /TiO2 /BTO(001). In the\ncase of the Fe bilayer on the CrO2 -terminated BTO, the\nlowest-energy configuration is antiferromagnetic for P\u2193\nand becomes ferromagnetic for P\u2191 . For this polarization\nthe Fe magnetic moments in the layer I+1 are far below\ntheir bulk value but the two Fe-(I+2) magnetic moments,\nwhich are ferromagnetically aligned to each other, contribute significantly to the total M . We estimate that\nthe total magnetic moment of the system changes from\nM <0.3 \u03bcB to >8 \u03bcB per unit cell area upon polarization reversal. Thus, the polarization reversal produces for\nX=Cr the effect of switchable magnetization. In Fig. 5,\nthe difference in energy, \u2206E = EAF M \u2212 EF M , calculated\nbetween the AFM and FM configurations and normalized per Fe atom, is plotted. For X=Cr the 2-ML-thick\nFe film represents a specific case of a magnetically soft\nsystem at fixed P. Nevertheless, any magnetic switch\nupon P reversal requires an energy which exceeds the\ncoercive field value of BTO.\nTo illustrate the interface ME coupling mechanism,\nwe plot in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 the spin density imbalance, (n+ (r)\u2212n\u2212 (r)), obtained under P -reversal near the\ninterface of FeL=2 /TiO2 /BTO and FeL=2 /CrO2 /BTO,\nrespectively. The (100) plane cutting through the X\nand O interfacial sites shows where the largest changes\nof the spin density occur and, hence, from where the\n\n\f5\nTABLE I: Local magnetic moments (in \u03bcB ) calculated for the two Fe adlayers labeled by I+1 and I+2 and interfacial X (X =\nCr, Ti) and O of FeL /XO2 /BaTiO3 (001) (L = 1, 2). In the topmost Fe layer I+2, there are two nonequivalent sites denoted as\nFeBa and FeX . The total magnetization Mtot includes the contributions from the interstitials.

Each of the four panels of Fig. 6\u20137\nshows the local magnetization density calculated at fixed\nP =(P\u2193 , P\u2191 ). These are shown for the two possible magnetic configurations which are either FM or AFM. For\nX=Ti, both the P\u2191 - and P\u2193 -poled states are antiferromagnetically ordered, as shown in the panels (b) and (d)\nof Fig. 6. The two results are similar to each other. The\nlargest negatively charged areas are seen around FeX (I+2) while the n+ - charged areas around the second Fe\nsite of this layer are not shown in Fig. 6. All other sites\nof FeL=2 /TiO2 /BTO including Fe-(I+1) indicate very\nsmall magnetic moments. Inspecting the spin density\nimbalance seen in Fig.7(a) and Fig.7(d) for the two energetically preferred but oppositely poled configurations of\nX=Cr, we find many differences in the magnetic structure. The panel (a) shows the ferromagnetically ordered\nstate P\u2191 where the Fe and Cr atoms form rather spacious regions of positive spin density n+ while n\u2212 can\nbe spotted around O, in the Fe interstitials and regions\ntowards the surface. In the case of P\u2193 , the energetically\nfavorable AFM configuration, shown in the panel (d), is\nsimilar to that of FeL=2 /TiO2 /BTO. Here, the large areas around FeX -(I+2) and also around interfacial Cr are\nnegatively charged. Besides, the pz -orbitals of interfacial\nO show their negative spin population resulting from hybridization with the 3d states of Fe-(I+1) whereas the\nO px and py orbitals, which form the bonds with the\nCr 3d states, contribute to n+ . Regarding the Fe-(I+1)\natoms of FeL=2 /CrO2 /BTO, Fig.7(d) shows that they\ncontribute to n+ contrarily to the case of X=Ti.\nThe site-projected and spin-resolved DOS calculated\nfor FeL=2 /XO2 /BTO are plotted in the two panels of\nFig. 8. For each system, the solid (shaded) lines represent the DOS curves in the P\u2191 (P\u2193 ) state. The energetically preferable magnetic configurations are shown only\nin Fig. 8 for each direction of P. In general, the DOS of\nthe interfacial XO2 layer is metallic for both systems. For\nL = 2 and X=Cr, however, the Cr 3d\u2013DOS indicates relatively strong spin polarization at the Fermi level. This\nis not surprising since the DOS of hypothetical BaCrO3\nshows similar behavior, as shown in Fig. 4.

For the two\nbiferroic interfaces studied here, the largest P-induced\nchange of M comes from the Fe-(I+2) atoms. For X=Cr,\nhowever, the absolute value of \u2206M approaches \u223c7 \u03bcB per\nunit cell. As result, the corresponding ME coupling coefficient increases significantly compared to that of X=Ti.\nWe demonstrate that the case of L = 2 and X=Cr stabilizes the FM ordering in the system with P pointing\nupwards. Surprisingly, this is completely due to rather\nmodest 5 % decrease of dI+1,I under P reversal, as shown\nin Fig. 3. With decreasing dI+1,I above CrO2 , the FM\norder is developing in the system. More precisely, when\nthe Fe-(I+1) magnetic moment becomes larger ferromagnetism is stabilized in layer (I+2).

We predict that a CrO2 -terminated interface instead of TiO2 may significantly enhance magnetoelectricity in the system.
