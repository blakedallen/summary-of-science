Introduction\nWe calculate the masses and decay constants of light pseudoscalar mesons in unquenched lattice QCD. These quantities serve as benchmarks for lattice calculations because they are relatively\nsimple to compute with all sources of systematic errors under control. They also provide a test\nof chiral perturbation theory (\u03c7 PT), including the more sophisticated versions that include lattice\ndiscretization effects. Successful calculation of these simple quantities lends confidence to calculations of more complicated quantities such as the kaon bag parameter (BK ) and K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix\nelements, which also rely on \u03c7 PT-guided extrapolations. Furthermore, the ratio of decay constants\nfK / f\u03c0 is interesting in its own right because it allows for a model-independent determination of the\nratio of CKM matrix elements |Vus |/|Vud | [1, 2].\nFollowing the approach of the LHP Collaboration, we use HYP-smeared domain-wall valence\nquarks and staggered sea quarks [3]. We use gauge configurations generated by the MILC Collaboration with a 2+1 flavor improved staggered action because they are publicly available and span a\nwide range of quark masses, lattice spacings, and volumes [2]. These lattices allow for good control\nover chiral and continuum extrapolations for light pseudoscalar quantities using staggered valence\nquarks. We show in this work that we have similar control over these extrapolations using domainwall valence quarks. We account for the effects of staggered sea quarks by using the appropriate\nmixed action \u03c7 PT (MA\u03c7 PT) expressions [4]. The \u03c7 PT formulas for light pseudoscalar quantities\nin the mixed-action theory are more continuum-like than in the purely staggered case, with fewer\nnew parameters. The mixed-action approach is especially powerful when considering more complicated quantities that are not protected from operator mixing under renormalization, such as BK .\nIn the staggered case, mixing with taste-breaking operators under renormalization creates significant complications [5]. In the mixed-action case, the chiral symmetry of the valence sector makes\nnonperturbative renormalization as straightforward as in dynamical domain-wall simulations [6].\nThe results presented in this work bolster confidence in our future mixed-action calculation of BK .\nIn Ref. [10] we have performed a strong check of the ability of MA\u03c7 PT to accurately describe\ndiscretization effects by investigating the isovector scalar correlator. We find that the MA\u03c7 PT\nprediction for the two-particle intermediate state (bubble) contribution to the scalar correlator is\nin good quantitative agreement with the numerical lattice data, even though there are large discretization effects due to staggered sea quarks. Thus we conclude that MA\u03c7 PT correctly describes\nthe dominant unitarity-violating contributions to mixed-action lattice simulations. Fortunately, in\nthe case of most weak-matrix elements, MA\u03c7 PT predicts that non-analytic unitarity-violating errors should contribute at the sub-percent level on the MILC lattices that we are using. This fact,\nin conjunction with our successful analysis of the scalar correlator, substantiates the claim that\nunitarity-violating effects in mixed-action lattice simulations can be accounted for and removed to\nrecover precise continuum values for weak matrix elements.\n\n2. Lattice calculation and chiral-continuum extrapolation\nWe generate data on the MILC ensembles given in Table 1. The quantities m\u2032s and m\u0302\u2032 denote\nthe values of the simulated staggered sea quark masses, while the unprimed quantities denote the\nphysical masses ms and m\u0302 = (mu + md )/2. We compute domain-wall valence quark propagators\n2\n\n\fMixed action decay constants\n\nJack Laiho\n\nTable 1: Simulation parameters of MILC staggered gauge configurations used in this work. \"Nominal\"\nquark masses are shown.\n\na(fm)\n\u2248 0.12\n\u2248 0.12\n\u2248 0.12\n\u2248 0.12\n\u2248 0.12\n\u2248 0.09\n\u2248 0.09\n\u2248 0.09\n\u2248 0.09\n\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s\n0.02/0.05\n0.01/0.05\n0.007/0.05\n0.005/0.05\n0.01/0.03\n0.0124/0.031\n0.0062/0.031\n0.0031/0.031\n0.0062/0.0186\n\nL(fm)\n2.4\n2.4\n2.4\n2.9\n2.4\n2.4\n2.4\n3.4\n2.4\n\nm\u03c0 L\n6.2\n4.5\n3.8\n3.8\n4.5\n5.8\n4.1\n4.2\n4.1\n\n10/g2\n6.79\n6.76\n6.76\n6.76\n6.76\n7.11\n7.09\n7.08\n7.10\n\nLat.

In order to minimize finite-volume\neffects, we restrict the combination m\u03c0 L >\n\u223c 4. We do not tune the masses of our valence-valence\npions to any particular values because one cannot recover unitarity to obtain full QCD at nonzero\nlattice spacing in the mixed-action theory. We instead generate many partially quenched data points\nat two lattice spacings, and use MA\u03c7 PT to extrapolate to the physical quark masses and continuum.\nThe one-loop MA\u03c7 PT expressions for most quantities of interest are the same as for chiral fermions\nexcept for the appearance of additive shifts to the sea-sea and valence-sea squared meson masses.\nBecause the two new splittings are easy to obtain from spectrum calculations [2, 10], they do not\nneed to be included as free parameters in chiral fits.\nIn order to suppress contamination from pions circling the lattice in the time direction, we use\nsymmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of quark propagators with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in our 2-point correlation functions. The approximate chiral symmetry\nof domain-wall quarks allows us to use the pseudoscalar current to obtain f\u03c0 , and we extract the\ndecay constant using the axial Ward identity:\n\u221a\n2(mx + my + 2mres )\nAW P\n,\n(2.1)\nfP = \u221a\n3/2\nAWW\nm\u03c0\nwhere AWW , AW P , and m\u03c0 come from a simultaneous fit of Coulomb gauge-fixed wall-wall and\nwall-point correlators. This channel is statistically cleaner than the axial current, and is protected\nby a non-renormalization theorem. Because chiral symmetry is not exact in our simulations at\nfinite LS = 16, there are small corrections to the axial Ward identity. We account for the dominant\ncorrections due to residual chiral symmetry breaking by including mres in Eq. (2.1). We estimate\nthe subleading O(mres mq a2 ) corrections to the axial Ward identity using our results at two lattice\nspacings and largely remove them in the continuum extrapolation.\nIn order to convert lattice quantities into physical units we use the MILC Collaboration's determination of the scale, r1 , where r1 is related to the force between static quarks, r12 F(r1 ) =\n1.0 [11, 12]. The ratio r1 /a can be calculated precisely on each ensemble from the static quark\npotential. We use the mass-independent prescription for r1 described in Ref. [13]. In order to fix\nthe absolute lattice scale, one must compute a physical quantity that can be compared directly to\nexperiment; we use the \u03a5 2S\u20131S splitting [14] and the most recent MILC determination of f\u03c0 [13].\n3\n\n\fMixed action decay constants\n\nJack Laiho\n\n\u03c7 2 /d.o.f. = 0.93, CL = 0.58\n\n\u03c7 2 /d.o.f. = 0.95, CL = 0.55\n\n5.8\n\n0.2\n\nfull QCD\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.01/0.05\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.007/0.05\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.005/0.05\n\u2032 = 0.0124/0.031\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\nPSfrag\nreplacements\ns\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.0062/0.031\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.0031/0.031\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.01/0.03\n\nr1 m2\u03c0 /2(mx + mres )\n\n5.4\n5\n\n\u221a\nr1 f\u03c0 / 2\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n4.6\n4.2\n3.8\n\n0.18\n\n0.16\n\nfull QCD\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.01/0.05\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.007/0.05\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.005/0.05\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.01/0.03\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.0124/0.031\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.0062/0.031\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.0031/0.031\nMILC\nexperiment\n\n0.14\n\n3.4\n3\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.12\n\n0.08\n\nr1 (mx + mres )\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\nr1 (mx + mres )\n\nFigure 1: Light pseudoscalar meson mass-squared (left plot) and decay constant (right plot) versus valence\nquark mass.

Only degenerate\n(mx = my ) points are shown.\n\nThe combination of the \u03a5 mass-splitting and the continuum-extrapolated r1 value at physical quark\nmasses leads to the determination r1phys = 0.318(7) fm [15]. The use of f\u03c0 to set the scale yields\n+26\nr1phys = 0.3108(15)(\u221279\n) fm [13]. This difference between the two scale determinations leads to a\nsystematic error in our decay constants labeled \"input r1 \" in Table 2.\nWe use the SU (3) MA\u03c7 PT formulas derived in Ref. [4] to extrapolate our numerical lattice\ndata to the continuum and physical quark masses. The choice of SU (3) \u03c7 PT is appropriate given\nthe parameters of our numerical simulations because our light pion masses range from 240-500\nMeV and are not much lighter than the physical kaon, which is integrated out in SU (2) \u03c7 PT.\nFurthermore, the largest of the taste-splittings on the coarse lattices is not much smaller than the\nkaon mass [a2 \u2206I \u2248 (460)2 MeV2 ], though on the fine lattices it is about a factor of 3 times smaller\n[a2 \u2206I \u2248 (280)2 MeV2 ]. The statistical errors on mP and fP are \u223c 0.5% \u2212 2% for most of our data\npoints. It is now well-established that NLO \u03c7 PT does not describe pseudoscalar masses and decay\nconstants to percent-level accuracy at the physical kaon mass, nor is it expected to based on power\ncounting. Our data set confirms this picture. In order to get good fits (as measured by the correlated\n\u03c7 2 /d.o.f.) to even our low-mass data we must include NNLO analytic terms. The two-loop NNLO\nlogarithmic corrections to the partially-quenched \u03c7 PT have been computed in Ref. [16], but we\nhave not yet implemented these terms in our fits because of their extremely complicated form.\nThese expressions would also have to be modified to account for the staggered sea sector, though,\ngiven our experience with the one-loop modifications to the mixed action, this is likely a small\neffect. In the region where the NNLO analytic terms that we have added are important, we expect\nthe NNLO logarithms to vary slowly enough that their effect is well approximated by the analytic\nterms. Even so, this somewhat ad hoc treatment gives rise to our largest systematic error in the\ndetermination of decay constants.\nWe perform chiral fits using two different mass ranges: one with all pions less than 500 MeV in\n4\n\n\fMixed action decay constants\n\nJack Laiho\n\n\u03c7 2 /d.o.f. = 1.20, CL = 0.15\n0.2\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.18\n\n0.2\n\n0.16\n\n\u221a\nr1 fSU(3) / 2\n\n\u221a\nr1 fxy / 2\n\n0.14\n\nfull QCD K +\nfull QCD \u03c0\nam\u0302\u2032\u2032 /am\u2032s\u2032 = 0.02/0.05\nam\u0302\u2032 /ams\u2032 = 0.01/0.05\nam\u0302\u2032 /ams\u2032 = 0.007/0.05\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032s = 0.005/0.05\nam\u0302 /ams = 0.01/0.03\nam\u0302\u2032\u2032 /am\u2032s\u2032 = 0.0124/0.031\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\nPSfrag\nreplacements\ns = 0.0062/0.031\nam\u0302\u2032 /am\u2032\u2032s = 0.0031/0.031\nam\u0302 /ams = 0.0062/0.0186\nMILC f\u03c0\nMILC fK\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.12\n0.1\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n\n0.08\n\nr1 (mx + mres )\n\nLO\nNLO\nAll higher orders\n\n0.08\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\nr1 (mx + mres )\n\nFigure 2: High-mass fit to fP data with chiral continuum extrapolation curves for fK and f\u03c0 on left. For\nnondegenerate mass points, the lighter valence quark mass is shown along the x-axis. Again, full QCD curves\nare obtained using the ratio of the quark normalization factors from tree-level \u03c7 PT to convert staggered quark\nmasses to domain wall masses in the MA\u03c7 PT formulas. Study of convergence of \u03c7 PT for decay constants\non right.\n\norder to study the chiral expansion, and another including masses up to the strange quark, which is\nused to determine our central values for masses and decay constants. We correct all data points for\nfinite-volume effects using one-loop MA\u03c7 PT, and take as a conservative estimate for the residual\nfinite-volume errors the entire one-loop correction at the data point where that correction is largest.\nThe light-mass fits to m2P /2(mx + mres ) and to fP are shown in Figure 1. For the leading-order lowenergy constants (LEC's) appearing in the chiral Lagrangian we use the physical values ( f\u03c0 , \u03bc ),\nrather than the values obtained in the SU (3) chiral limit. To one-loop order this is consistent, and\nstudies by both the MILC and JLQCD Collaborations suggest that use of a physical parameter for\nthe chiral coupling ( f\u03c0 rather than f0 ) is likely to result in a more convergent chiral expansion [2,\n17]. We fit the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants separately, since they have no common\nparameters through one-loop once the leading order LEC's are set to the physical values. We vary\nthe parameter f appearing in the one-loop expression between the values f0 and fK as part of our\nestimate of the chiral fit systematic error. Each of our low-mass fits has 42 data points and 9-10 fit\nparameters; our high-mass fits have 69 data points and 15-16 fit parameters. We do not constrain the\nsize of the LEC's with priors. Figure 1 shows the continuum full QCD curve for f\u03c0 with statistical\nerrors as a cyan band. The black curve on the decay constant plot is the continuum full QCD result\ndetermined by MILC using staggered fermions, after rescaling the bare quark mass in the x-axis\nby the appropriate factor. Despite the very different shapes of the partially quenched mixed-action\ndata and staggered data (not shown; see Ref. [2]) at finite lattice spacing, the continuum curves are\nin good agreement. We also show the experimentally-measured value of f\u03c0 (which is offset for\nclarity) using the \u03a5 spectrum to set the scale for comparison.\nWe present the result of the high-mass fit used to obtain f\u03c0 and fK in Figure 2. The cyan and\ngrey bands show the continuum full QCD extrapolations with statistical errors for degenerate ( f\u03c0 )\n5\n\n\fMixed action decay constants\n\nJack Laiho\n\nand nondegenerate ( fK ) decay constants, respectively. For the nondegenerate curve, the strange\nmass is fixed at its physical value. We determine the physical bare valence u-, d-, and s-quark\nmasses from our fits to m2P ; the physical bare sea quark masses were determined by MILC in a\nsimilar manner. In order to obtain the charged pion and kaon decay constants, we extrapolate the\nlight valence-quark mass to m\u0302 for f\u03c0 but to mu for fK . The light sea-quark masses are set to m\u0302 for\nboth decay constants, and this leads to a slight vertical offset in the final value for fK as compared\nto the grey full QCD band in Figure 2. In order to achieve good fits including nondegenerate\npseudoscalar masses up to \u2248 600 MeV, we must include higher-order polynomial terms. Figure 2\nshows all of the data points used in the high-mass fP fit. In addition to the NNLO analytic terms,\nwe include terms proportional to (mx + my )n . We find that we cannot get good correlated fits unless\nn is as high as six. Figure 2 compares our results for decay constants with those obtained by the\nMILC Collaboration. This comparison is more meaningful than a comparison with experiment\nbecause we are using the MILC r1 (obtained from f\u03c0 ) to set the scale, and one needs |Vus | in order\nto extract fK from experiment. Figure 2 also shows the breakdown of our high-mass fit including\nterms through LO, NLO, and \"all higher orders\" to the degenerate SU(3) curve in the continuum\nlimit. The right-most part of this plot corresponds to 500 MeV, where we do not expect \u03c7 PT to\nbe especially convergent. Because we are interpolating in the quark mass in this region, we expect\nthe high-order polynomials to approximate higher-order nonanalytic effects, whereas closer to the\nphysical pion mass, the NLO contributions should be dominant. We find the results of our fits to be\nconsistent with the expectations from chiral power-counting. It would, nevertheless, be valuable to\ncontinue this study with the complete and correct NNLO formula including chiral logarithms.\nThe error in Table 2 labeled \"chiral-continuum extrapolation\" is estimated by performing a\nnumber of different \"reasonable\" fits and taking the spread between them. For example, we add\nadditional higher-order analytic terms (giving fits with acceptable confidence levels) and compare\nthe results with those obtained from the preferred fit. We also vary the coefficient of the log terms\nbetween f0 and f\u03c0 as part of our estimate of the f\u03c0 error, and between f\u03c0 and fK as part of our\nestimate of the error in fK . Although we include terms proportional to a2 in the preferred fit,\nthere is some ambiguity (with only two lattice spacings) in the dominant source of discretization\nerrors, which may be purely a2 corrections, taste-breaking terms proportional to \u03b1s2 a2 , or chiral\nsymmetry breaking terms proportional to mres a2 . It is also possible that the different sources lead\nto discretization effects of the same size. We therefore vary the coefficient of the NLO a2 analytic\nterms and include the resulting spread in the decay constants as part of the systematic error. We\nalso include the parametric uncertainty coming from the uncertainty in the bare quark masses in\nthe chiral extrapolation error.\n\nTable 2: Preliminary error budget.

Our errors are somewhat\nreduced as compared to the results presented in the talk, due to the completion of an additional\nfine ensemble with a light strange sea quark. Given the experimental values for the kaon and\npion leptonic branching fractions and the electroweak corrections [18], we obtain |Vus |/|Vud | =\n0.2315(45)(7), where the first error is the lattice error (with statistical and systematic errors added\nin quadrature), and the second is the combined error from experiment and electroweak radiative\ncorrections. Taking the PDG value of |Vud | = 0.97418(27) from superallowed \u03b2 -decay [18], we\nobtain |Vus | = 0.2255(44)(7). This is consistent with the value of |Vus | = 0.2255(19) coming from\nsemileptonic kaon decays and non-lattice theory [18]. Given the above value of |Vud |, our value of\n|Vus | is also consistent with unitarity.\n\nReferences\n[1] W. J. Marciano, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 231803 (2004) [arXiv:hep-ph/0402299].\n[2] C.
