The promise of industrial\nexploitation of negative refraction has midwifed the extension of theoretical studies to bianisotropic materials [2, 3, 4]. The hope is that nanotechnological routes will allow negative\nrefraction in the optical regime, which would be a truly remarkable accomplishment.\nThe classical electromagnetic vacuum cannot support NPV plane waves, as it appears\nthe same to all observers moving at constant relative velocities [5].

If the cosmological\nconstant \u039b is positive (negative), the spacetime is called de Sitter (anti-de Sitter) spacetime\n[9]. The apparent singularity at m = 0 arises because of an infelicitous choice of coordinate\nsystem. The metric can actually be extended to a geodesically complete space of constant\ncurvature in other coordinate systems [10].\nThe electromagnetic response of vacuum in curved spacetime may be described by the\nconstitutive relations of an equivalent, instantaneously responding, medium as per [6, 11,\n12, 13]\n)\nD = \u01eb0 \u03b3 \u2022 E\n,\n(3)\nB = \u03bc0 \u03b3 \u2022 H\nwherein SI units are implemented.

By exploiting (25), we see that k \u2022 P < 0\nfollows from m\u0303z < 0 ; i.e., NPV propagation arises provided that\n\u039b>\n\n3c2\n.\nz\u0303 2\n\n(31)\n\nAccording to the NPV condition (31), the anti\u2013de Sitter spacetime (i.e., \u039b < 0 ) does not\nsupport NPV propagation, unlike the de Sitter spacetime (i.e., \u039b > 0 ) which supports NPV\npropagation as long as the cosmological constant is sufficiently large. Equivalently, NPV\npropagation is feasible in de Sitter spacetime at sufficiently remote locations. We observe\nthat de Sitter NPV propagation is supported at locations which lie outside the event horizon\nspecified by (x2 + y 2 + z 2 ) = 3c2 /\u039b.\n\n5\n\nApplicability of NPV condition\n\nLet us comment now on the applicability of the NPV condition (31). Suppose \u03b4 is some\nrepresentative linear dimension of the neighbourhood R. The uniform approximation, as\nimplemented for our planewave analysis, rests upon the assumptions that \u03b4 is (i) small\ncompared with the curvature of the global spacetime; and (ii) large compared with electromagnetic wavelength as given by 2\u03c0/k. To be specific, consider the Ricci scalar R. For de\nSitter spacetime we have [15]\n4\u039b\nR= 2 .\n(32)\nc\n5\n\n\fAs R provides a measure of the inverse radius of spacetime curvature squared, the neighbourhood R is such that\nr\nc\n2\u03c0\n\u03c1\n\u226a\u03b4\u226a\n,\n(33)\n|k|\n2 |\u039b|\n\nwhere \u03c1 is a proportionality constant. Thus, we see that the partition of global spacetime\nrequires\nc2 |k|2 \u03c1\n|\u039b| \u226a\n.\n(34)\n16\u03c0 2\nSince the linear dimensions \u03b4 of the neighbourhood R are chosen independently of the z\u0303\ncoordinate specifying the location of R, there is no incompatibility between the conditions\nimposed on \u039b by the NPV inequality (31) and the uniform approximation inequalities (33).\nAfter solving for the planewave propagation modes in each neighbourhood, the neighbourhood solutions may be stitched together to provide the global solution. The piecewise\nuniform approximation technique adopted here - which is described in detail elsewhere\n[14] - is commonly employed in solving differential equations with nonhomogeneous coefficients [16].\n\n6\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nWe have theoretically examined the propagation of electromagnetic plane waves with the\ntime\u2013averaged Poynting vector directed in opposition to the wavevector in cosmological\nspacetime with piecewise uniform metric. Our derivations lead us to conclude that NPV\npropagation is possible for \u039b sufficiently large and positive (de Sitter spacetime); but it\nis impossible for negative \u039b, i.e., when the spacetime is of the anti\u2013de Sitter type. This\ndifference between the two types of spacetimes should be added to the catalogue of known\ndifferences for scalar waves [17].\nRecent string\u2013inspired theories with large extra dimensions, known as brane\u2013world models [18, 19, 20], suggest that gravitational interactions between particles on the brane in\nuncompactified bulk five-dimensional space can exhibit the correct four\u2013dimensional brane\nbehaviour, through finely tuning a relation between the bulk cosmological constant and\nthe brane tension. In the original Randall\u2013Sundrum model [19], the cosmological constant\nand the brane tension exactly cancel each other. More recent models, which admit the\npossibility of the cosmological constant and the brane tension not being in complete cancellation, yield a net cosmological constant on the four\u2013dimensional brane that could be\neither positive or negative [21]. As a consequence of our results, one could envision an optical/electromagnetic experiment, based upon the negative refraction associated with NPV\npropagation [3, 22], which may reveal whether or not a four\u2013dimensional universe - deriving from a five\u2013dimensional brane universe - has a sufficiently large positive cosmological\nconstant.\n\nAcknowledgements SS acknowledges EPSRC for support under grant GR/S60631/01.\n6\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Shelby R A, Smith D R and Schultz S 2001 Experimental verification of a negative\nindex of refraction Science 292 77\u201379\n[2] Lakhtakia A, McCall M W and Weiglhofer W S 2003 Negative phase\u2013velocity mediums\nIntroduction to Complex Mediums for Optics and Electromagnetics ed W S Weiglhofer\nand A Lakhtakia (Bellingham, WA: SPIE Press) pp347\u2013363\n[3] Pendry J B 2004 Negative refraction Contemporary Phys. 45, 191\u2013202\n[4] Mackay TG and Lakhtakia A 2004 Plane waves with negative phase velocity in Faraday\nchiral mediums Phys.
