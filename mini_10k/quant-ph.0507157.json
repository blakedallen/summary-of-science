Examples\nof such controlled structures are provided.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the previous article, we showed that quantum systems become \"non-holonomic\"\nwhen perturbed in a certain time-dependent way : as a result of the perturbation, all global constraints on the dynamics are removed and the system becomes\nfully controlled. The straightforward application of the non-holonomic control\nto groups of interacting two-level systems, the so-called qubits, is a promising\nway to achieve computational algorithms widely discussed in quantum informatics [1, 2, 3, 4]. Indeed, quantum computations [5] are achieved through\ncombining well-chosen quantum gates [6], which are the analog of the classical logic gates and consist in particular evolutions of the system chosen as a\ncomputer. In this context, the non-holonomic control is a precious means for\nimplementing any gate and thus performing any computation on an arbitrary\nquantum system. However, the direct control of an N -qubit computer's evolution is a very heavy (or even intractable) computational task when N is a large\nnumber, since it requires the control of 4N physical parameters. To overcome\nthis impediment one can combine completely controlled cells in a manner which\ndepends on the kind of the problem to be solved : the adaptation of the structure of the quantum device, obtained as a particular arrangement of controlled\nelements, to the computation to be performed allows one to decrease the number\nof the free control parameters needed, and thus the complexity of the control\nproblem. The complete control of the whole compound device is thus assured\nby the controllability of the individual cells as well as their connections with\neach other within the architecture of the computer.\nIn the first section of this paper, we provide an example of a unit cell, which\nis completely controlled through non-holonomic interactions. In the second section, we propose two different devices composed of such cells, the arrangements\nof which suit particularly well universal quantum computations and simulation\nof quantum field dynamics, respectively. In the third section, we finally describe\na toy device that can perform quantum computations on 9 qubits and show in\nparticular how it can perform the discrete Fourier transform on 9 qubits.\n\n2\n\nCompletely Controlled Unit Cell\n\nOne way to construct a completely controlled but not immediately universal\nquantum device is to build it up from small parts, called \"unit cells\", each of\nwhich is non-holonomic and therefore directly and universally controllable. The\n2\n\n\fproper functioning of the device relies then on the appropriate connection of\nthe cells. In this way the universality of the device is obtained indirectly, not\nby applying a huge number of controls, but by smartly connecting the cells and\nchoosing the sequence of operations performed. There is no general prescription\non how to construct a particular device; this requires expertise in the art of\n\"programming\" the operations of the cells and their interactions.\n\n2.1\n\nCell structure\n\nFig. 1 shows an example of a completely controlled unit cell composed of three\ntwo-level atoms, each with ground and excited states |0i and |1i, having distinct\ntransition frequencies \u03c91a , \u03c92a , and \u03c93a . The atoms are subject to dipole-dipole\ninteractions and are coupled to two external fields: an electromagnetic field\nE\u03c9 = E\u03c9 cos\u03c9t of nearly resonant frequency \u03c9, and a static electric field ES .\nThe dipole-dipole interaction is fixed and determines the principal, unperturbed\nb 0 , while the external fields provide two controllable\nHamiltonian of the system, H\nb\nb\nperturbations, P\u03c9 and PS . The Hilbert space of the system has a \"computational\nbasis\" of N = 23 = 8 states, |xi \u2261 |x2 x1 x0 i \u2261 |x2 i|x1 i|x0 i, x = 0, 1, . . . , 7,\nP2\nwhere the state of the ith atom encodes the ith binary digit of x = r=0 xr 2r as\na qubit [see Fig. 1(b)]. The crucial requirement is the non-holonomic character\nb 0 , Pb\u03c9 , PbS , and their commutators of all orders must span\nof the interaction : H\nthe linear space of 8 \u00d7 8 Hermitian matrices.

Their values can be changed by variation of a static electric field\nES (Stark effect), which results in energy shifts Ai \u2192 Ai + \u2206i for single atoms,\nwhere \u2206i = \u03b1i ES depend on atom-specific electric permeability constants \u03b1i ,\nand similar shifts \u2206ij = \u2206i + \u2206j and \u2206\u03c3 = \u22061 + \u22062 + \u22063 for two and three\natomic detunings respectively.\nNote that, by a proper choice of \u2206i and \u03c9, one can set two of three Ai to\nzero. Moreover, for clarity we also set to zero the third Ai , which remains just\nb 0 otherwise. Hence, hereafter, all \u2206i denote just the deviations from\na part of H\nzero resulting from the variation ES of the Stark field. The last together with\nthe amplitude = E\u03c9 serve as a time dependent control parameters CS and C\u03c9\nrespectively.

Thus, the evolution of the system is governed by a Hamiltonian\nwhich is constant on each interval:\nb\nb 0 + Ck Pbk\nH(t)\n=H\n\nt \u2208 [(k \u2212 1)\u03c4, k\u03c4 ].\n\n(4)\n\n\u2192\n\u2212\n(ii) We look for the 64-dimensional vector C (0) such that\n\u0014\n\u0015\n64\n\u0010\u2192\n\u2212 (0) \u0011 Y\ni b\n(0) b\nb\nb\n\u2261\nexp \u2212 (H0 + Ck Pk )\u03c4 = I.\nU C\n~\n\n(5)\n\nk=1\n\nTo this end, we first solve the \"8th root\" of Eq.

Fig. 3 shows two possible arrangements\nof unit cells designed for two different purposes : the first one suites more the\npurpose of quantum computing, while the second is more useful for simulating\nlattice quantum field dynamics.\nThe first device (Fig. 3(a)) is organized in a tree-like structure. In this\narrangement, the quantum state of one atom in each cell can be exchanged with\nthe state of an atom in the closest parent joint of the tree. Even though the\nsimplest way to make the exchange is to straightforwardly displace the atom\nto the parent joint, the exchange or transport of the state without moving the\natom can be more practical. The tree-like architecture and the possibility to\nperform all the unitary transformations (including all the permutations) in each\nunit cell allow one to put together the states of any three two-level atoms of\nthe device and make them interfere after at most s = 6 log3 n state exchanges,\nby moving them toward the root of the tree to a common cell. Placing the new\nstates back (if needed) requires the same number of inverse exchanges. This is\na very modest number, s \u223c 40, even for a rather large device of n \u223c 103 with\nHilbert space of N = 2n \u223c 10300 dimensions. Hence, all basic operations of\nquantum computation can be performed on any physical system composed of\nnon-holonomic triads of two-level subsystems arranged in a tree-like structure,\nand each operation can be completed within 64\u00d716\u00d712\u00d7log3 n control intervals\n\u03c4 . Note that the identity transformation should be applied to all other cells to\npreserve their states during the operation.\nThe second arrangement of cells (Fig. 3(b)) is mainly designed to emulate\nthe dynamics of quantum fields on lattices. Of course, it can also perform\ngeneral operations on any triad, but for a higher cost of s = O(n1/2 ). In this\narrangement, after each control period of 64\u03c4 the closest neighboring atoms\nare differently regrouped in triads (cells), with the original grouping repeating\nitself after three consecutive periods. Therefore, at each moment the change of\nthe cell state depends on the states of the neighboring cells, as it should be in\norder to emulate the dynamics of the fields. Immediate analogy to the Ising\nmodel emerges when we restrict ourselves to small values of \u01eb for which terms of\norder \u01eb2 are negligible, and then each T = 64\u03c4 period plays the role of the time\nincrement \u2206\u03c4 = \u01eb. The evolution of such a device is determined by three sums\nb q,p , one for each period p = 1, 2, 3,\nb (p) = P H\nof effective cell Hamiltonians, H\nq\nef f\nb q,p is the effective Hamiltonian of the qth cell at the pth period.\nwhere H\nWe can cast the cell Hamiltonians to sums of tensor products of Pauli matrices \u03c3\nb\u03b1i , where the Greek index \u03b1 = x, y, z denotes the matrix type and the Latin\nindex i specifies the two-level atom on which it acts. Since the cells are under\ncomplete control, the coefficients of this development can be made an arbitrary\n\n8\n\n\f1\n\n2\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\na)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nb)\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n\nFigure 3: Two possible arrangements of cells for special purpose devices: (a)\ntree-like structure for quantum computation; (b) planar lattice for simulating\ndynamics of quantum fields.

By a proper choice of the coefficients A, B, C\nthrough the appropriate control sequences, one can simulate different linear and\nnon-linear lattice models of quantum fields with time dependent parameters.\n\n4\n\nToy Device\n\nTo conclude this paper, we now describe a toy device that can perform quantum computations on 9 qubits. An ensemble of 9 different Rydberg atoms, i.e.\natoms of different elements or identical atoms which are excited to distinct pairs\nof Rydberg states, is placed in a magneto-optical trap at low temperature, as\nillustrated in Fig. 4. The best candidates for such a device are the long-living\nstates corresponding to large angular momentum. By placing all the atoms in\na static electric field, one lifts the degeneracy in the magnetic quantum number\nand performs tuning if needed. All the atoms experience the dipole-dipole interb ij = dbi dbj hR\u22123 i, where the cube of the inverse distance between atoms\naction D\nij\nis averaged over their translational quantum states. Note, however, that only\nfor almost resonant atoms this interaction is important. By a proper choice of\nthe atomic states and the static field ES , we obtain three triads, p = 1, 2, 3, each\nof which is composed of three almost resonant two-level atoms with transition\nfrequencies centered on distinct frequencies \u03c9p . For each triad p, the interacb ij give the principal Hamiltonian, while a microwave field E\u03c9p at the\ntions D\nfrequency \u03c9p serves as a control perturbation. Transportation of the state of\none atom in each triad to the parent joint can be performed by dipole or Raman\n\u03c0 transitions from the initial pair of Rydberg levels to a higher pair. With these\nhigher pairs assumed nearly resonant with a frequency \u03c94 , atoms 3, 6 and 7\nform a higher-level triad-the parent joint of the first three triads-which is\ncontrolled by a fourth microwave field E\u03c94 of frequency \u03c94 .\nAs an application of our technique, we show how to perform the discrete\nFourier transform modulo N = 29 = 512 on the toy device we have just pre-\n\n10\n\n\f2\n\n8\n\u03c93\n\n\u03c91\n1\n\n3\n\n9\n\n7\n\n\u03c94\n6\n\u03c92\n\n5\n\n4\n\nFigure 4: A toy device, composed of 9 Rydberg atoms, which can perform\nquantum computations on 9 qubits. Each atom is a two-level system shown\nschematically by double orbits. Atoms of different triads are excited to distinct\npairs of Rydberg states. Each triad p is controlled by an external field of distinct\nfrequency \u03c9p . One atom in each triad can be excited to a pair of higher Rydberg\nstates, thus forming a higher-level triad: (3, 6, 7). These excitations (depicted\nby arrows) correspond to state transportations.\n\n11\n\n\fsented. This operation is achieved by the following 9-qubit unitary transformation\nN \u22121\n1 X\nFbN |xi = \u221a\nexp(2\u03c0ixy/N )|yi,\n(11)\nN y=0\n\nwhere |xi and |yi belong to the system computational basis, the states of which\nare defined by\n|xi \u2261 |x8 i9 . . . |x1 i2 |x0 i1 ,\n(12)\nP8\nwith x \u2261 r=0 xr 2r = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1 (xr = 0, 1), and where | ii denotes the\nstate of the ith atom-the ith qubit. The algorithm we employ to perform the\nFourier transform is based on constructing the exponent in Eq. (11) as\nexp(2\u03c0ixy/29 ) =\n\n8 Y\nr\nY\n\nexp(i\u03c0x\u2032r ys /2r\u2212s ),\n\n(13)\n\nr=0 s=0\n\nwhere x\u2032r \u2261 x8\u2212r .

Then we complete the transform\nin the following 9 steps: (i) We \"split\" the first qubit (the state of atom 1) by\napplying the unitary transformation\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u2212i\u03c0\n1\n1 1\n1\u2212 2\n1\u221a\nb\n,\n(15)\n= exp \u221a\nA\u2261 \u221a\n1 \u22121\n1\n\u22121 \u2212 2\n2\n8\nwhich maps |0i \u2192 \u221a12 (|0i + |1i) and |1i \u2192 \u221a12 (|0i \u2212 |1i). Note that this would\nalready complete the Fourier transform if we had only one qubit. (ii) Next,\nwe apply to the first and second qubits the conditional phase shift |ai2 |bi1 \u2192\nei\u03c0ab/2 |ai2 |bi1 (a, b = 0, 1), explicitly given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0\n0\n\uf8ec\n0 \uf8f7\nb21 \u2261 \uf8ec 0 1 0\n\uf8f7 = B(\u03c0/2),\nb\nB\n(16)\n\uf8ed 0 0 1\n0 \uf8f8\ni\u03c0/2\n0 0 0 e\nb\nwhere B(\u03c6)\nis the unitary transformation\n\uf8ee\n\uf8eb\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ec 0\nb\n\uf8ec\nB(\u03c6)\n= exp \uf8ef\n\uf8f0\u2212i\u03c6 \uf8ed 0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n0\n\uf8fa\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8fa .\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f8\n0\n\u22121\n\n(17)\n\nb This\nThen we \"split\" the second qubit by applying the transformation A.\naccounts for the contribution of the second most significant bit of the input\n12\n\n\fx.

Two examples of such architectures have been\nprovided in this paper, which are built in accordance with the computational\ntask they are supposed to carry out. Moreover, as an example, a toy device has\nbeen considered, which is able to perform a concrete computation on 9 qubits.\n\nA\n\nToffoli gate\n\nThe Toffoli-gate transformation is the unitary transformation on three qubits,\nbT of f |x2 i|x1 i|x0 i = |x2 i|x1 i|x0 XOR (x1 AND x2 )i,\nU\n\n(20)\n\nwhich corresponds to the three-bit classical logic gate,\nx2\nx1\nx0\n\n\u2192 x\u20322 = x2\n\n\u2192 x\u20321 = x1\n\u2192 x\u20320 = x0 XOR (x1 AND x2 ),\n\n13\n\n(21)\n\n\fintroduced by Toffoli as a universal gate for classical reversible computation.\nIt acts as a permutation of the computational basis states, |xi \u2261 |x2 i|x1 i|x0 i,\nP2\nx \u2261 r=0 xr 2r = 0, 1, . . . , 7, given by the unitary matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nbT of f = \uf8ec 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \uf8f7 .\nU\n(22)\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \uf8f8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\nThis matrix can be presented as\nbT of f = exp(\u2212i\u03c0 H\nbT of f ),\nU\n\nwith the (idempotent) Hermitian matrix\n\uf8eb\n0 0 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 0\n1\nb\nHT of f = \uf8ec\n2\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1 \u22121\n\u22121 1\n\n(23)\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(24)\n\nIn our control scheme the Toffoli-gate transformation can be effected on the unit\nb\u01eb/8 \u2261 exp(\u2212i\u03c0 H\nb T of f /8) (\u01eb = \u03c0),\ncell by repeating 8 times the transformation U\nb (t = 64T ) = U\nb\u01eb/8 (see Fig. 2(d)).\nwhich is directly attainable: U\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
