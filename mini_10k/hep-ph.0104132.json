We show how a combined analysis of several\nstrange hadron resonances can be used in a study of freeze-out dynamics.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nStrangeness signature of QGP originates in the observation that when color bonds are broken,\nthe chemically (abundance) equilibrated deconfined state has an unusually high abundance of\nstrange quarks 1 . Considering the possibility that the relatively small size of the plasma fireball\nwould suppress this enhancement, It was shown that when the system size is greater than about\nfive elementary hadronic volumes 2 the physical properties of the hadronic system, including\nin particular strangeness enhancement, are nearly as expected for an infinite system. Kinetic\nstudy of the dynamical process of chemical strangeness equilibration demonstrated that only the\ngluon component in the QGP is able to produce strangeness rapidly 3 . Therefore strangeness\nenhancement is today considered to be related directly to presence of gluons in QGP.\nThe high density of strangeness in the reaction fireball favors formation of multi strange\nhadrons 4,5 , which are produced rarely if only individual hadrons collide 6,7 . In particular a\nlarge enhancement of multi strange antibaryons arising with a threshold behavior as function of\nenergy has been proposed as characteristic and nearly background-free signature of QGP 4 .\nA systematic strange antibaryon enhancement has in fact been observed, rising with strangeness content 8 . Moreover there is now evidence that the enhancement of \u039e shows a sudden onset\nwhen the number of participating (wounded) nucleons exceeds 50 9 . Similar results were reported\nfor the Kaon yields by the NA52 collaboration 10 . This threshold behavior arises for volumes\nwhich are relatively large and not a result of the smallness of the physical system ('canonical\n\n\fsuppression' 11 ), thus arise from opening up of novel reaction mechanisms, as is expected should\nQGP formation occur.\nWe also see in the experimental data that particles of very different properties are appearing\nwith identical or similar m\u22a5 -spectra 12 . The symmetry between strange baryon and antibaryon\nspectra is strongly suggesting that the same reaction mechanism produces \u039b and \u039b and \u039e and\n\u039e. This is understood readily if a dense fireball of matter formed in heavy ion reactions expands\nexplosively, super cools, and in the end encounters a mechanical instability which facilitates\nsudden break up into hadrons 13 .\nImportant in the understanding of the strange particle signatures of the QGP phase is the\nproper determination of the baseline of particle yield expected. The comparison of AA (nucleusnucleus) results should be always made with the N A (nucleon-nucleus) collision system as the\nbaseline, and in a wide range the value of A should not matter. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat multi strange antibaryons are enhanced against this well defined N A baseline in a pattern\nexpected in QGP hadronization. Yet it has been argued that strangeness signals of QGP are not\nunique 11 , since comparing pp (proton-proton) to pA (proton-nucleus) interactions one observes\na change of production pattern of strange particles. Since in these reactions also a change in\nnon-strange particle yields is observed due to isospin selection rules and shadowing, we believe\nthat this line of taught is incorrect.\nWe report in section 2 that thermal freeze-out occurs at the same condition found in chemical\nanalysis. We also consider the present knowledge about strange hadrons at RHIC. In section 3,\nwe will introduce a method to evaluate the lifespan of the hadronic phase following formation\nof hadron multiplicity. The idea is to use abundance of unstable resonances which have varying\nwidth and to determine fraction which becomes unobservable in consideration of the re-scattering\neffects.\n2\n2.1\n\nChemical and thermal freeze-out\nStrange hyperon m\u22a5 spectra\n\nIn recent months experiment WA97 determined the relative normalization of m\u22a5 -distribution\nfor strange particles \u039b, \u039b, \u039e, \u039e, \u03a9 + \u03a9, Ks = (K 0 + K 0 )/2 in four centrality bins 12 . We\nhave since obtained a simultaneous description of the absolute yield (chemical freeze-out) and\nshape (thermal freeze-out) of these results 14 . Our strategy is to maximize the precision of the\ndescription of the final multi-particle hadron state employing statistical methods. This requires\nthat we introduce parameters which characterize possible chemical non-equilibria, and velocities\nof matter evolution. These latest results were obtained with two velocities: a local flow velocity v\nof the fireball volume element where from particles emerge, and hadronization surface (breakup)\nvelocity which we refer to as vf\u22121 \u2261 dtf /dxf .\nWe have found, as is generally believed and expected, that all hadron m\u22a5 -spectra are strongly\ninfluenced by resonance decays. We assume here that the resonance spectra are not reequilibrated in rescattering. The final particle distribution is composed of directly produced particles\nand first generation decay products, as no other contributing decays are known for hyperons,\nand hard kaons. Since the relative contributions of resonances and directly emitted particles are\nstrongly temperature dependent, thermal analysis of hyperons converges to a well defined best\ntemperature and velocities of expansion and hadronization.\nWe present in Fig. 1 these freeze-out properties. The solid horizontal lines delineate error\nrange of chemical freeze-out analysis we present in subsection 2.2. We see that the thermal\nfreeze-out is consistent with the purely chemical analysis of data that included non-strange\nmesons and baryons. The value of vf (top right) is near to velocity of light which is consistent\nwith the picture of a sudden breakup of the fireball.\n\n\f1.10\n\n200\n190\n\n1.00\n\n180\n\nvf\n\n0.90\n\n170\n\n0.80\n\nT [Gev]\n\n160\n150\n\n0.70\n\nchemical fit\nT limits\n\n140\n\n0.60\n\n130\n\nv\n\nchemical fit\nflow limits\n\n0.50\n\n120\n\n0.40\n\n110\n100\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0.30\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\nMultiplicity bin\n\n3\nMultiplicity bin\n\n4\n\nFigure 1: Thermal freeze-out temperature T (left) and flow velocity v (bottom right) and break up (hadronization\nhyper-surface propagation) velocity vf (top right) for different collision centrality bins.

It will be interesting to see\nif the low centrality 5th bin now studied by experiment WA57 and which shows a different\nenhancement pattern 9 , will also show different thermal freeze-out properties.\nWe show in Fig. 2 to left \u039b-spectra which are most precisely known, and to right \u03a9+\u03a9-spectra\nwhich are least precisely known. All other (anti)hyperon m\u22a5 -spectra (\u039b, \u039e, \u039b) are described as\nwell as we see it in the \u039b-spectra. We found that parameters found in the analysis of hyperons\nand antihypoerons predicted correctly the Ks m\u22a5 -spectra.\nAlthough in the purely chemical fit, we excluded the \u03a9, \u03a9 yields due to their anomalous\nenhancement, we did include their spectra in the thermal analysis. In all four centrality bins\nfor the sum \u03a9 + \u03a9 we systematically under predict the two lowest m\u22a5 data points, as is seen\nin Fig. 2 right panel. This low-m\u22a5 excess also explains why the inverse m\u22a5 slopes for \u03a9, \u03a9 are\nreported to be smaller than the values seen in all other strange (anti)hyperons. We note that\nthe 1.5 s.d. deviations in the low m\u22a5 -bins of the \u03a9 + \u03a9 spectrum translates into 3 s.d. deviations\nfrom the prediction of the statistical model chemical analysis.\n\n\fTable 1: Freeze-out conditions and physical properties of a hadronic matter fireball formed in Pb\u2013Pb interactions\n\u221a\nat sNN = 17.2 GeV, left column with, and right column without imposed strangeness balance.\ns,\u03b3\n\n\u03c72T ; N ; p; r\nT [MeV]\nv\n\u03bbq\n\u03bbs\n\u03b3q\n\u03b3s /\u03b3q\nEfin /Sf\nsf /b\n(s\u0304f \u2212 sf )/b\n2.2\n\nPb|v q\n2.25; 10; 3; 2\n150 \u00b1 3\n0.57 \u00b1 0.04\n1.616 \u00b1 0.025\n1.105\u2217\n\u2217\nm\nc\n\u03b3q = e \u03c0 /2Tf = 1.61\n1.02 \u00b1 0.06\n0.163 \u00b1 0.01\n0.68 \u00b1 0.05\n0\u2217\n\n\u03b3\n\nPb|vq\n1.36; 10; 4; 2\n145 \u00b1 3.5\n0.52 \u00b1 0.055\n1.625 \u00b1 0.025\n1.095 \u00b1 0.02\n\u03b3qc \u2217 = em\u03c0 /2Tf = 1.59\n1.02 \u00b1 0.06\n0.158 \u00b1 0.01\n0.69 \u00b1 0.05\n0.05 \u00b1 0.05\n\nGlobal chemical freeze-out condition at SPS\n\nIn our chemical freeze-out analysis to which we compared the thermal results in Fig. 1 there are\na few theoretical refinements compared to earlier work 15 , such as use of Fermi-Bose statistics\nthroughout, more extensive resonance cascading. In the input data we omit the NA49 \u039b/p\u0304\nratio and update the NA49 \u03c6-yields. The total \u03c72T , the number of measurements used N the\nnumber of parameters being varied p and the number of restrictions on data points r are shown\nin heading of the table 1. The values imply that our model has a very high confidence level.\nIn the upper section of table 1, we show statistical model parameters which best describe\nthe experimental results for Pb\u2013Pb data. We show in turn chemical freeze-out temperature, T\n[MeV], expansion velocity v, the light and strange quark fugacities \u03bbq , \u03bbs and light quark phase\nspace occupancy \u03b3q and the ratio strange to light quark ratio \u03b3s /\u03b3q . We fix \u03b3q at the point\nof maximum pion entropy density \u03b3qc = em\u03c0 /2Tf since this is the natural value to which the fit\nconverges once the Bose distribution for pions is used.\nIt is interesting that in the Pb\u2013Pb collisions \u03b3s /\u03b3q is so close to unity, the often tacitly\nassumed value. In this detail the revised analysis differs more than 2 s.d. from our earlier\nresults 15 . Only other notable difference is the prediction for \u039b/p\u0304 \u2243 0.5 (not shown in table).\nIn the bottom section of table 1, we show physical properties of the fireball derived from\nthe properties of the hadronic phase space: Efin /Sf , the specific energy per entropy of the\nhadronizing volume element in local rest frame; sf /b specific strangeness per baryon; (s\u0304f \u2212 sf )/b\nnet strangeness of the full hadron phase space characterized by these statistical parameters.\nWe see, in the bottom of the right column in table 1, that within error strangeness is\nbalanced. In the first column of table 1 we see that imposing exact strangeness balance increases\nthe chemical freeze-out temperature T from 145 to 150 MeV. Insisting on exact balance may\nbe an incorrect procedure since the WA97 central rapidity data, which are an important input\ninto this analysis, are only known at central rapidity. It is likely that the longitudinal flow of\nlight quark content contributes to some mild s\u2013s\u0304-quark separation in rapidity. For this reason\nwe normally consider the results presented in right column of table 1 to be more representative\nof the freeze-out dynamics.\n2.3\n\nFirst look at RHIC freeze-out\n\n\u221a\nThere is now first hadronic particle and strangeness data from RHIC sN N = 130 GeV, presented at QM2001 by the STAR collaboration 17 . We draw the following conclusions from these\nresults;\n\n\f1. from p\u0304/p = 0.6 \u00b1 0.02 = \u03bb\u22126\nq it follows \u03bbq = 1.089;\n2. and hence \u03bcB = 38 MeV (18% of SPS value) at T = 150 MeV. If a hadronization at\nT = 175 MeV applies this value rises to \u03bcB = 44 MeV.\n\u22124\n\u22122 \u22124\n3. The ratios \u039b/\u039b = 0.73 \u00b1 0.03 = \u03bb\u22122\ns \u03bbq and \u039e/\u039e = 0.82 \u00b1 0.08 = \u03bbs \u03bbq are consistent\nwithin 1.5% with \u03bbs = 1, value expected for sudden hadronization.\n\n4. K + /K \u2212 = 0.88 \u00b1 0.06 is also consistent within error with \u03bbq = 1.089.\n5. On the other hand the ratio K \u2217 /K \u2217 \u2243 1 differs from K/K significantly. This suggests\nthat K \u2217 , K \u2217 yields are influenced at the level of 10% by 'in hadronization' decay product\nre-scattering in an asymmetric way.\n6. Thus K \u2217 , K \u2217 should not be used to fix T using the ratios K \u2217 /h\u2212 and K \u2217 /h\u2212 .\n7. The ratio p\u0304/\u03c0 = 8% cannot be used to fix T since p\u0304 yield contains undetermined hyperon\nfeed 16 .\n8. The ratio K \u2212 /\u03c0 \u2212 does not suffice to fix the temperature: we need at least 3 reliable yield\nratios as we must also fix \u03b3q , \u03b3s : K \u2212 /\u03c0 \u2212 = 15% = f (T )\u03b3s /\u03b3d .\nWe conclude that the first RHIC results allow to understand the magnitude of chemical potentials\n\u03bcs = 0, \u03bcb = 38 MeV, but T and \u03b3q , \u03b3s cannot yet be fixed. Given the rescattering phenomena\nof resonances one cannot do a global analysis without stable strange hadron yields, akin to the\nsituation we have at SPS energy range. Thus the final analysis must await the time these results\nbecome available. On the other hand the strong presence of observable resonances in hadronic\nfinal state as reported by the STAR experiment implies that hadronization has occurred in a\nsudden fashion, as has been seen at SPS. Other RHIC results such as correlation analysis, are\nalso strongly suggestive of sudden break-up/hadronization.\nThe major departure at RHIC from SPS physics is the great strangeness density. We note\nthat:\ndNK \u2212\ndNK +\n|y=0 = 35 \u00b1 3.5 ,\n|y=0 = 30 \u00b1 3 .\ndy\ndy\nTotal strangeness (s\u0304) yield depends on unmeasured hyperons. Model calculations suggest more\nthan 20%. Hence:\nds\u0304\n|y=0 > 85 \u00b1 9 ,\ndy\n\ncompare to\n\nd\u03c0 +\nd\u03c0 \u2212\n\u2243\n\u2243 235.\ndy\ndy\n\n\u221a\nUnder these conditions calculations suggest that s\u0304/b \u2243 8 (11\u201312 times greater than at sN N =\n17.2 A GeV SPS Pb\u2013Pb).\nGiven this immense strangeness rapidity yield it is very difficult to imagine that among three\nquarks which coalesce to make a baryon there is no strange quark! Hence we predict that most\nbaryons and antibaryons produced will carry strangeness 16 . Thus non-strange nucleons and\nantinucleons are strongly contaminated by hyperon decay feed, and at this time the reported\nnucleon RHIC results cannot be used in order to characterize freeze-out conditions.\n3\n\nResonances and freeze-out dynamics\n\nWe consider strange hadron resonance production as probe freeze-out dynamics18,19 . The \u039b(1520)\nabundance yield is found about 2 times smaller than expectations based on the yield extrapolated from nucleon-nucleon reactions 20 . This is to be compared with the enhancement by factor\n2.5 of \u039b-production. A possible explanation for this effective suppression by a factor 5 is that\n\n\flife[fm]\n\np\nmally\n\nther\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n1\n...\n5\n7\n\n\u039b(1520)/(all \u039b)\n\n10\n\nced\nrodu\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nThermally\n\nlife[fm]\n\nd\n\nproduce\n\n1\n...\n5\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\u039b(1520)/(all \u039b)\n\n\u0393\u039b(1520)=15.6 MeV\n\n7\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n10\n\n15\n20\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u0393\u039b(1520)=150 MeV\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\nT [MeV]\n\n180\n\n200\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\nT [MeV]\n\n180\n\n200\n\nFigure 3: Relative \u039b(1520)/(all \u039b) yield as function of freeze-out temperature T . Dashed - thermal yield, solid\nlines: observable yield for evolution lasting the time shown (1....20 fm) in an opaque medium. Left: natural\nresonance width \u0393\u039b(1520) = 15.6 MeV, right: quenched \u0393\u039b(1520) = 150 MeV.\n\nthe decay products (\u03c0, \u039b) have re-scattered and thus their momenta did not allow to reconstruct\nthis state in an invariant mass analysis. In a study of the rescattering of the resonance products\nwe found that if the resonance decay occurs in fireball matter, one of the decay products will\nin general rescatter and thus the resonance will not be observable in the reconstruction of the\ninvariant mass 18 .\nA back of envelope calculation based on exponential population attenuation suggests that if\nthe observable yield of \u039b(1520) is reduced by factor 5, the observable yield of K \u2217 (892) with much\ngreater width, \u0393K \u2217 (892) = 50 MeV, should be suppressed by a factor 15. However, both SPS 21\nand RHIC experiments 17 report measurement of K \u2217 (892) signal. A possible explanation is that\nin matter the lifespan of \u039b(1520) can be quenched in collisions such as \u03c0+\u039b(1520) \u2192 \u03a3\u2217 \u2192 \u03c0+\u039b .\nThis is possible since \u0393\u039b(1520) is small due to need for angular L = 2 partial wave in its decay.\nWe show in Fig. 3 how quenching impacts \u039b(1520)/(all \u039b) yield: left panel is for the natural\nwidth \u0393\u039b(1520) = 15.6 MeV, right panel is for a width quenched to 150 MeV. NA49 has just\nreported \u039b(1520)/(all \u039b) = 0.025\u00b10.008 which is barely if at all compatible with the unquenched\nresult, since it implies an extremely long hadronization time of about 20 \u00b1 5 fm/c (depending\non freeze-out temperature) which is incompatible with other experimental results. On the other\nhand, after introduction of a quenched resonance width the experimental result is compatible\nfor all freeze-out temperatures with a sudden hadronization model.\nThe study of several strange hadron resonances e.g. \u039b(1520), K \u2217 (892), \u03a3\u2217 (1385) \u0393\u03a3\u2217 (1385) =\n35 MeV, provides a tool capable of probing conditions at particle freeze-out. We recall that\n\u03a3\u2217 (1385) decays into \u039b and is expected to be produced more abundantly than \u039b(1520) in a\nhadronic fireball due to it's high degeneracy factor and smaller mass. How a systematic approach\nwill work is shown in Fig. 4 which shows relative yield of one resonance as function of another,\nhere presented for their natural widths. As indicated from top to bottom in the grid, the lifespan\nin matter increases, while from left to right the temperature of chemical freeze-out increases.\n4\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nTo close we look at a few highlights of our report. Our thermal freeze-out analysis confirms\nthat CERN-SPS results decisively show interesting and new physics, and confirms the reaction\npicture of a suddenly hadronizing QGP-fireball with both chemical and thermal freeze-out being\nthe same. Thermal freeze-out condition for strange hadrons (K0s , \u039b, \u039b, \u039e, \u039e) agree within error\n\n\f0.60\n0.60\nd\n\nce\n\ned\n\nd\nro\n\nyp\n\nall\n\n+\n\nK (892)/(All K )\n\nuc\n\nlife[fm]\n\n5\n5\n7\n\n10\n10\n\n15\n20\n\n0.00\n0.00\n\nT=\n17\n\n...\n\nT=\n2\n\n0.20\n\n00\n\n1\n\nT=\n1\n\nT=\n125\n\nth\n\nT=\n100\nT=\n125\nT=\n15\n0\n\n7\n\nT=\n100\n\n5\n\n50\nT=\nT= 175\n20\n0\n\n...\n\n0.20\n\nm\ner\n\n*\n\n[M\neV\n]\n\n1\n\n0.40\n\n[M\neV\n]\n\nlife[fm]\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03a3 (1385)/(All \u039b)\n\nyp\n\nall\n\nrm\nthe\n\n0.40\n\nu\nrod\n\n0.05\n\u039b(1520)/(All \u039b)\n\n0.10\n\n0.00\n0.00\n\n20 15\n\n0.05\n\u039b(1520)/(All \u039b)\n\n0.10\n\nFigure 4: Dependence of the combined \u03a3\u2217 /(all \u039b)with \u039b(1520)/(all \u039b) (left) and K \u2217 (892)/(all K) with\n\u039b(1520)/(all \u039b) (right) resonance production on the chemical freeze-out temperature and hadron matter lifetime.\n\nwith chemical freeze-out and we have confirmed the freeze-out temperature T \u2243 145 MeV.\nWe were able to determine the freeze-out surface dynamics and have shown that the breakup velocity vf is nearly velocity of light, as would be expected in a sudden breakup of a QGP\nfireball. We found that the experimental production data of \u03a9 + \u03a9 has a noticeable systematic\nlow-p\u22a5 enhancement anomaly present in all centrality bins. This result shows that it is not\na different temperature of freeze-out of \u03a9 + \u03a9 that leads to more enhanced yield, but a soft\nmomentum secondary source which contributes almost equal number of soft \u03a9 + \u03a9 compared to\nthe systematic yield predicted by the other strange hadrons.\nWe have presented in section 3 results on strange hadron resonance production and argued\nthat a study of several resonances with considerably different physical properties must be used in\na study of freeze-out dynamics of QGP. Strange resonances are easier to explore, since their decay\ninvolve rarer strange hadrons and thus the backgrounds are smaller. Moreover, the detectability\nof the naturally wide non-strange resonances is always relatively small, except if (very) sudden\nhadronization applies. For this reason it will be quite interesting to see if \u2206(1230) can be\nobserved at all, as this would be only possible if chemical and thermal freeze-out conditions are\ntruly coincident.\nThis discussion of how resonances help to understand the hadronization dynamics is a beginning of a complex analysis which will occur in interaction with experimental results. We saw\nthat observable strange resonance yields can vary widely depending on conditions which should\nallow a detailed study of QGP freeze-out dynamics. We believe considering \u039b(1520) result that\nin-matter resonance lifetime quenching is significant.\nAcknowledgments\nWork supported in part by a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, DE-FG03-95ER40937.\nLaboratoire de Physique Th\u00e9orique et Hautes Energies, University Paris 6 and 7, is supported\nby CNRS as Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche, UMR7589.\nReferences\n1.
