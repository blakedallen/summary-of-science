The ZDCs will measure neutrons\nand very forward photons for the heavy-ion and low-luminosity (up to 1033 cm-2s-1) pp\ncollisions. The design is robust, as simple as possible and based on the Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider (RHIC) ZDC design [1], which showed highly successful\nperformance for the four RHIC BNL experiments: BRAHMS, PHOBOS, PHENIX\nand STAR.\nThe ZDCs will provide reliable measurements of real-time luminosity, beam tuning\nand accelerator monitoring during A+A, p+A, and p+p running. In the A+A mode, the\nmeasured coincidence rate of forward-backward neutron signals emitted in the decay\n\n\fof the Coulomb excited colliding ions can be used to determine the absolute A+A\nluminosity. The ZDCs, in addition, will help to discriminate effectively against beamresidual gas backgrounds and complement other available methods for commissioning\nthe proton and ion beams at the LHC.\nThe event-by-event determination of the heavy-ion collision centrality is a basic\nprerequisite for any physics measurement of A+A reactions. The centrality of A+A\nreactions determines the degree of overlapping of the colliding nuclei and, thus, the\nmaximum energy density reached in the interaction. Because the ZDCs are sensitive to\n\"spectator\" neutrons, they are important detectors for measurements of reaction\ncentrality. The combination of ZDCs measuring the energy of forward neutrons,\ntogether with other multiplicity detectors at more central rapidity, has become the\nstandard method for determining reaction centrality in A+A collisions at RHIC.\nThe ZDCs have been proven at RHIC to be of paramount importance for triggering\nand tagging UPC (ultra peripheral collision) events by measuring the forward\nneutrons issuing from the Coulomb-excited-nucleus dissociation.\nFor the photon measurement, it is necessary to have an electromagnetic zero-degree\ncalorimeter in front of the neutron zero-degree calorimeter. The \"standard\" PomeronPomeron diffractive A+A collision leading to central particle production and forward\nnucleus dissociation will not only be a background for \u03b3+\u03b3 and \u03b3+A processes but also\na signal in their own right, accessible to study with the ZDC.\n\nMECHANICAL AND OPTICAL DESIGN\nIn order to measure neutrons and very forward photons the calorimeter will be\nplaced downstream of the first beam dipole magnet in the straight section and between\nthe two beam pipes. In CMS this region is located ~140 m on each side of the\ninteraction vertex inside the neutral particle absorber (TAN), designed to protect LHC\nmagnets by limiting their absorbed dose. This neutral particle absorber was built with\na detector slot of 1 m length, 96 mm width and 607 mm height, into which are inserted\n90 cm length copper absorber bars and a transversally segmented ionizing chamber\n(proton-proton luminosity monitor). The design of each individual ZDC includes two\nindependent calorimeter sections, the electromagnetic section (EM section) and the\nhadronic section (HAD section). These sections replace the copper absorbers (see Fig.\n1). The ZDC calorimeter sections are sampling calorimeters with the core of each\nstructure consisting of a tungsten-plate/quartz-fiber-ribbon stack. A significant\nadvantage of this technology is that the calorimeter is compact, extremely fast, and\nradiation hard. Quartz fibers were chosen as the active media of the ZDC calorimeters\nbecause of their unique radiation hardness features and the intrinsic speed of the\nCherenkov effect. The quartz-quartz fibers can withstand up to 30 GRad with only a\nfew percent loss in transparency in the wavelength range of 300 nm to 425 nm. The\nCherenkov light generated by charged particles passing through the fibers is brought\nto photomultiplier tubes (PMT).\nThe HAD section consists of 24 layers of 15.5 mm thick tungsten plates and 24\nlayers of 0.7 mm diameter quartz fibers. The EM section is made of 33 layers of 2 mm\nthick tungsten plates and 33 layers of 0.7 mm diameter quartz fibers. The hadronic\nsection is longitudinally segmented into 4 readout segments of ~1.4 nuclear interaction\n\n\flength each. The tungsten plates are tilted by 45\u00b0.The fibers of each individual\ntungsten/quartz fiber cell are grouped together to form readout bundles. The four fiber\nbundles are coupled to four photomultiplier tubes via long air core lightguides which\nprovide optical mixing and matching of the fiber bundle to the photocathode.\n\nFIGURE 1. Schematic illustration of the TAN detector slot showing the location of the p-p luminosity\nmonitor and the ZDC (EM section and HAD section).\n\nThe electromagnetic section is segmented into 5 horizontal (transverse) individual\nreadout towers. The tungsten plates are oriented vertically. The fibers from each\nindividual tower are grouped together to form a readout tower bundle. These are each\ncoupled directly to the PMT. All calorimeter sections will be instrumented with the\nsame type of PMT, R7525, used in the HF (forward hadronic) calorimeter. The\nphysical characteristics of the ZDC are summarized in Table 1.\nTABLE 1.

Recent examples of detectors incorporating this\ntechnology include the zero degree calorimeters for the four heavy-ion experiments at\nRHIC. Much of the technology employed in the optical and mechanical design of\nCMS ZDC has its origins in the original research and development conducted for the\nZDCs of RHIC and the HF calorimeter of the CMS experiment at the LHC, including\nthe preparation of the optical components (quartz optical fibers, optical lightguides)\nand the characterization of the phototubes.\n\nRADIATION ENVIRONMENT\nThe LHC will have 7 TeV proton beams with nominal luminosity L= 1034 cm-2s-1\nand with an interaction rate of 8\u00d7108s-1. The power density, power dissipation, particle\nfluxes and spectra, accumulated dose and residual dose rates for the TAN neutral\nabsorber have been evaluated by means of the DPMJET event generator for p-p\ncollisions based on the MARS code [3]. During the pp runs with luminosity L= 1033\ncm-2s-1 the expected average absorbed radiation dose will be of about 18 GRad/year.\nWhereas, for a one-month PbPb run the expected averaged absorbed dose will be ~30\nMRad. To avoid radiation damage of the optical fibers, the ZDC will only be installed\nduring the heavy-ion runs and the first low-luminosity p-p runs.\nThe phototubes will be located about ~500 mm above the beam line and ~140 m\nfrom the interaction point. According to estimates, the radiation environment will be\non the same level as for the PMTs of the HF calorimeter (~10 krad/yr for the design pp luminosity of 1034 cm-2s-1). This dose is permitting the use of the same Hamamatsu\nR7525 PMTs used by the HF calorimeter.\n\nPMT SYSTEM\nThe PMT systems of the HF calorimeter have been adopted for the ZDC. The aircore light guide of the hadronic section design is based on studies performed by the\nHF group at the University of Iowa. These studies show that the diffusion of light due\nto the mixer is optimum. Thus the 20% variation in quantum efficiency that might be\nexpected as a result of the non-uniform response of various fibers is reduced to a few\npercent as a result of utilization of the mixer. The PMTs for the ZDC are eight-stage\nHamamatsu R7525 phototubes with bi-alkali photocathodes, resulting in an average\nquantum efficiency for Cherenkov light of about 10%. The resistive chain high voltage\nbase (ratio \"B\") is optimized to achieve a high gain and the maximum dynamic range\nof linearity (linearity is on the level of 2% for dynamic range of up to 103). The PMT\nand base are housed in a shielding enclosure (housing). All housing components,\nexcept for the \uf06d-metal shields, are fabricated in the University of Kansas (KU) physics\nmachine shop.\n\n\fPROTOTYPING\nAn engineering mechanical prototype was designed and constructed at KU. The test\nmodule design was virtually identical to one quarter of the HAD section design (one\nlongitudinal tower). The module was used to establish assembling protocol and to\nverify the assembly tolerances and clearances. Fiber routing and fiber ribbons\npreparation was also studied with the first mechanical prototype. Experience gained\nthrough these studies was important in establishing the final fiber routing scheme and\nfiber ribbon design.\n\nFIGURE 2. Picture showing the mechanical prototype of one longitudinal tower of the HAD section.\n\nIn consultation with the LHC integration group, many of the details of how to\ninstall the ZDC were worked out this year. A dummy ZDC was made from plastic and\nsuccessfully inserted into the two TANs that will be used for CMS. Finally a wooden\nfull scale copy of a TAN has been constructed at CERN to help sort out installation\nissues on the surface.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nThe ZDC sections have been studied with both stand-alone simulations and CMS\nGEANT4 simulations. These studies have been directed both towards optimization of\nthe calorimeter design and towards understanding the detector performance. Following\nthe simulation studies, we have fixed the main version of the converter for the EM\nsection to be 33 tungsten plates with a thickness of 2 mm (~19Xo) and quartz fibers\nwith a core diameter of 0.6 mm. We required that the energy resolution should be\n\n\fbetter than 10% for 50 GeV photons and that the calorimeter should be linear within\n2% in the energy range from 10 GeV to 100 GeV. The simulation shows that a\ncalorimeter with this geometry meets our requirements. The resulting energy\nresolution is displayed in Fig. 3.\n\nFIGURE 3. Energy resolution of the ZDC electromagnetic section.\n\nThe transverse cell size (in the horizontal plane) for the electromagnetic calorimeter\nis fixed at ~18 mm. This ensures that the main energy deposition from a single particle\noccurs in one cell. The 50 GeV photon shower profile is given in Fig. 4. The width of\nthe shower is ~5 mm and the separation of two particles with a relative distance of\nabout 2 cm in the horizontal plane at the entrance to the calorimeter is easy to\ndistinguish. The standard technique of shower-profile fitting can be applied to separate\ncloser showers. In practice, this position resolution will allow measurement of the\nbeam crossing angle with a resolution of ~10 mrad.\n\nFIGURE 4. The 50 GeV photon shower profile in the EM section of ZDC.\n\n\fThe ZDC hadronic section will be in the very forward region, and thus the\ncalorimeter needs to be quite dense so as to absorb hadrons with an energy of a few\nTeV. The choice of tungsten as the passive material meets this requirement. We have\nstudied different tungsten plate thickness varying from 5 mm to 20 mm and we did not\nfind significant changes in energy resolution for energies in the region from 500 GeV\nto 3 TeV. For quartz fibers with core diameter of 0.6 mm the energy resolution will be\nin the range 10% \u00b1 2%, which is better than our requirement of 15% for 3 TeV. For\npractical reasons, such as the number of tungsten plates, the number of fiber ribbons,\nand the limited space, we chose 15.5 mm tungsten plates as the absorber in the HAD\nsection. The energy resolution for a calorimeter with 10 mm-thick tungsten plates is\npresented in Fig. 5.\n\nFIGURE 5. The energy resolution of the hadronic section of ZDC.\n\nELECTRONICS\nThe ZDC electronics includes the four major functions necessary for the\nfunctioning and data reading from the detector: front-end electronics, trigger\nelectronics, data acquisition, and the high voltage system needed for operation of the\nphototubes.\nIn the nucleus-nucleus running mode, the ZDC is a central detector for Level-1\ntriggering. The standard ZDC minimum bias trigger uses a coincidence of the signals\nfrom the two calorimeters (right and left) on both sides of the interaction point. In\naddition, a single (or double) signal from one (or both) ZDCs will be used to trigger\non ultraperipheral electromagnetic nucleus-nucleus interactions leading to the\ndissociation of one (or both) colliding nuclei. These coincidences are processed by the\nZDC electronics in the counting room.\nThe front-end electronics, including signal processing, digitization, buffering,\n\n\fformation of an event trigger, and the first level of readout, is located in HCAL VME\ncrates as close to the ZDC as possible. Because of the time delays introduced these\ncrates located in the adjacent underground counting room (USC55).\nThere are a total of 18 readout channels for the two ZDCs. The signals from the\nZDCs are transmitted through a long (210 m) coaxial cable to the counting room.\nSignals from the EM channels will go directly to the QIE ASIC. The signal from each\nHAD channel will be split into two signals; one signal will go to the QIE and the other\nwill be summed with the other three HAD channel signals. The analog sum of the four\nsignals related to each HAD section, proportional to the total energy deposition in\neach detector and proportional to the total number of spectators coming out from the\ninteraction, will be sent to the splitter. One output signal of the splitter will go to the\nQIE to provide a Level 1 trigger for several centrality intervals, and other signal will\ngo to the input of the discriminator and then to a logic unit for coincidence. The\ncoincidence of two signals from both sides of the interaction point is sensitive to most\nof the nuclear and electromagnetic cross section. Information from scalers will be used\nfor tuning the interaction of beams and for defining the real-time luminosity.\n\nINSTALLATION AND PLANS\nThe ZDC detector configuration necessary to accomplish all of the physics goals\nincludes 2 ZDCs (two hadron sections and two electromagnetic sections). The Day 1\ndetector implementation will provide physics results. The installation operation is\nscheduled to start early September of 2006. After all connections are complete, each\nsection will be tested and commissioned. Testing and commissioning of the detectors\nwill mainly involve HV (high voltage) system tests and LED (light emitting diode)\nand laser calibrations. Each ZDC section will have been calibrated in the test beam.\nWe foresee all functionality of the read-out to be tested and operational shortly after\nthe cables are connected and the electronics in the counting room is functioning.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank S.
