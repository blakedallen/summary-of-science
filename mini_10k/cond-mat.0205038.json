INTRODUCTION\n\nIn this work, we attempt to relate generalized statistical theories to correlated electron or quasiparticle systems\nwhich, since 1980's, have been subjected to intensive theoretical and experimental studies due to their important\nroles in optical [1], mechanical [2], electric and magnetic [3\u20138] properties of metal compounds with partially filled\nd- or f-electrons. In general, with complex correlations, the conventional Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics (BGS) for free\nfermions is no longer valid. Most of the theoretical study up to now was numerical simulations based on approximate\nmodels including essential physics of the systems of interest. Although these theoretical works are very important\nand fruitful, the need of general understanding and theoretical formulation of the distribution laws begins to be felt.\nDue to the complexity of the correlations, we can conjecture that generalization of Fermi-Dirac (FD) theory may be\nuseful. In this sense, some efforts have been made to understand localized electron behavior on the basis of fractal\ngeometry (see [9] and references there-in), a generalization of normal space-time.\nIn what follows, I present a work in this direction based, not on the fractal or chaotic assumption, but on generalized\nstatistical theories proposed for complex systems showing correlated phenomena. The theoretical results will be\ncompared to numerical and experimental ones for correlated electrons. It is expected that this attempt can help to\nbetter understand different generalized theories and identify valid theories for this special circumstance.\nII. SOME IMPORTANT GENERALIZATIONS OF BGS AND CORRELATED ELECTRONS\n\nIndeed, in the last decade, BGS theory has experienced a turbulent period with the rapid development of some\nanomalous theories to treat complex systems. These theories are anomalous in the sense that they may perturb our\nold conceptions concerning, e.g., information, energy, quantum states, additivity etc. The main characters of these\ntheories can be resumed as follows :\n1) Consideration of nonadditivity in entropy, energy, quantum occupation number etc. depending on empirical\nparameters, e.g. 0 < q < \u221e in Tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics (NSM) [10] and in its incomplete statistics\n(IS) version [11\u201315] as well as in quantum group theory (QGT) [16,17], \u03ba \u2265 0 in \u03ba-statistics (KS) [18].\n2) Bosonization of fermions or fermionization of bosons allowing intermediate occupation number related to empirical parameter, e.g. 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1 in fractional exclusion statistics(FES) [17,19\u201322] and \u22121 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1 for the FES in the\nframe of KS [18].\n3) The empirical parameters take some particular values when the theories recover BGS (q = 1, \u03b1 = 0, 1, \u03ba = 0\nand \u03b7 = \u22121, 0, 1).\nThe philosophy of these generalizations, explicit or not, is to introduce empirical parameters to \"absorb\" the effects\nof complex correlations. So interacting systems can be mathematically treated as noninteracting or conventional ones.\nFor example, the total energy of an interacting \"free particle\" can be written as p2 /2m where p is the momentum and\nm the mass of the particle. The extra interaction energy is in this way \"absorbed\" in the empirical parameter when\nthey are different from the values corresponding to conventional cases.\nAbout the generalization of FD statistics, Figure 1 shows the different fermion distributions at T =100 K of the\ngeneralized statistical mechanics mentioned above. We see that the discontinuity in occupation number n at Fermi\nenergy ef depends almost only on temperature for all these distributions. The sharp n-drop hardly changes for\nwhatever value of the empirical parameters. In addition, we note that the approximate distribution (AD) n =\n1\n(0 < q \u2264 1 in order that the inverse temperature \u03b2 can go to \u221e) of NSM obtained with\n[1+(q\u22121)\u03b2(e\u2212ef )]1/(q\u22121) +1\n1\n\n\ffactorization approximation [22,23] by neglecting correlation energy between the particles is only slightly different from\nFD one. So its Fermi energy is almost identical to that of FD. The situation of KS is similar. At low temperature,\n1\n[18] is hardly different from\nthe \u03ba-distribution of standard fermion (\u03b7 = 1) n = \u221a 2 2\n2\n1/\u03ba\n[\n\n1+\u03ba \u03b2 (e\u2212ef ) +\u03ba\u03b2(e\u2212ef )]\n\n+1\n\nFD for \u03ba values which give finite internal energy (e.g. 0 \u2264 \u03ba < 1/2 for two dimensional fermion gas). For FES\n(1+\u03b1)/\u03b1\n1\nfermion distribution (1/n \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b1 (1/n \u2212 \u03b1 + 1)1\u2212\u03b1 = e(e\u2212ef )/kT [19] (or equivalently n = q\u03b2(e\u2212e\n\u2212 q\u03b2(e\u2212e\nf ) \u22121\nf )(1+\u03b1)/\u03b1 \u22121\ne\ne\n[24]), the n-discontinuity depends only on temperature just as for FD. The influence of \u03b1 smaller than unity (for\nFD) is to decrease ef (\u03b1 times) and to increase the maximal occupation number (1/\u03b1). As for the nonextensive\n1\nfermion distribution of IS n = [1+(q\u22121)\u03b2(e\u2212e\nq/(q\u22121) +1 [14,15], though n drop at ef is always very sharp, ef increase\nf )]\nconsiderably as q decreases from unity. And consequently, there is an important wide n decrease with decreasing q.\nIt was shown [15] that, for q \u2192 0, ef can increase up to two times the ef of FD with n = 1/2 (n = 0) for all energy\nbelow (above) ef . Another common character of NSM and IS distributions is that, due to the energy cutoff with\nq < 1, there are few electrons above ef at low temperature (large \u03b2).\nNow let see the distributions of correlated electrons. From some results of experiments and numerical simulations\nbased on low dimension Kondo lattice models (KLM) [5\u20138], we notice two important effects of correlations. First,\nthe wide decrease of n and the sharp n drop at ef much larger than that without correlation have indeed been\nobserved for very strongly correlated electrons (with the coupling parameter J \u2265 4) [6,8] (see Figure 3 and 4). So it\nis possible to describe correlated electron systems in strong coupling regime by IS fermion distribution with q very\nsmaller than unity (close to zero) [15]. On the other hand, another effect of correlation, in the weak coupling regime,\nis the flattening of n drop at ef [5\u20138]. That is that the correlation, even at low temperature, drives electrons above\nef so that the n discontinuity becomes less and less sharp as the correlation increases. Curiously, this flattening of\nn discontinuity at ef , though confirmed by experimental results [5], is completely absent in the fermion distributions\ngiven by all the statistics, extensive (FES) or nonextensive (NSM, IS and KS), mentioned above.\nFermi surface plays an essential role in the physical properties of metals and metal compounds. So it is of great\ninterest for generalized statistical theories to take into account the essential physics relevant to Fermi energy. In what\nfollows, we will show that it is possible to cover the observed weak correlation effects upon ef within an additive\ngeneralization of BGS based on the IS principles. The reader can find a complete review of IS theory in references\n[11\u201315].\nIII. ADDITIVE INCOMPLETE STATISTICS\n\nThe concept of IS is inspired by incomplete probability distribution (i.e. Tr\u03c1 = Q 6= 1) [25] as well as the theoretical\ndifficulties one encounters with Tr\u03c1q 6= 1 in NSM [10,13]. The basic assumption of IS is that our knowledge about\nphysical systems is in general incomplete due to unknown interactions or their effects which can not be studied\nexplicitly. In this case, there are always missing informations about the physical systems. So probability distribution\nis in general inexact and incomplete and can not sum to one. One should write Tr(\u03c1/Q) = TrF (\u03c1) = 1 where F is\ncertain function to be determined. In the case of complete or approximately complete distribution (such as BGS), F\nis identity function. In my previous paper, in order to keep Tsallis framework of NSM, I proposed F (\u03c1) = \u03c1q so that\nTr\u03c1q = 1,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q is Tsallis entropy index [11\u201313]. Since \u03c1 < 1, we have to set q \u2208 [0, \u221e]. When q = 1, \u03c1 becomes complete,\nwhich implies a complete or quasi-complete knowledge about the system of interest. The nonextensive IS formalism\n[11,13] on the basis of Tsallis entropy yields Tsallis q-exponential distributions and the fermion distribution [14,15]\ndiscussed above. An successful application of Eq.(1) to the study of some power laws on the basis of R\u00e9nyi entropy\n[25] can be found in reference [26]. One can even find a plausible justification of Eq.(1) in a work of Tsallis on\nthe probability distribution on some simple fractal supports like Koch or Cantor sets [27]. Indeed, the phase space\nof the systems including complex interactions is in general chaotic or fractal structure. In these structures, exact\nprobability distribution is impossible due to the fact that, first, the structures are not differentiable and integrable,\nsecond, as mentioned above, some state points in the structures are not accessible. So the treatment of the incomplete\ndistributions, not in the fractal space of df dimension, but in a differentiable and integrable d-dimension space, is\ninevitable. This consideration yields in a natural way the incomplete normalization Eq.(1) [15].\nP\nNow we suppose that the system of interest has additive information and physical quantities (e.g. H = i Hi\nwhere H is the hamiltonian of the compound system and Hi that of the ith subsystem). This case may happen if\nthere are only weak and short range interactions, so that the Hartley formula ln(1/\u03c1) for information measure should\napply. The entropy of the system can be defined \u00e0 la Shannon as follows [12] :\n\n2\n\n\fS = kTr\u03c1q ln(1/\u03c1).\n\n(2)\n\nS obviously becomes Gibbs-Shannon entropy (SGS ) when q = 1, which identifies k to Boltzmann constant. It is\nstraightforward to see that S verifies all the properties of SGS . For microcanonical ensemble (\u03c1q = w1 ), we have\nS = kq lnw which decreases with increasing q value. In general, \u2206S = S \u2212 SGS < 0 (or > 0) if q > 1 (or q < 0).\nFor canonical ensemble, we postulate\nU = Tr\u03c1q H\n\n(3)\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian and U the internal energy of the system. The maximum entropy of S with Eq.(1) and\n(3) as constraints leads to :\n\u03c1=\n\n1 \u2212\u03b2H\ne\nZ\n\n(4)\n\u2202S\n\nwith Z = (Tre\u2212q\u03b2H )1/q . The Lagrange parameter \u03b2 can be determined by \u2202Uqq = k\u03b2 = T1 where T is the absolute\ntemperature. It is easy to see that all thermodynamic relations in this theory are identical to those in BGS.\nWe indicate in passing that this generalization of BGS is obviously the consequence of the \"power-normalization\"\nEq.(1). Other useful normalizations, if any, of incomplete distributions may lead to different generalization of BGS.\nFor example, if we use Hartley formula as information measure and define expectation value for additive entropy\nF (x)\n1/x\nwhere \u03b3 is an empirical parameter, maximum entropy\nand energy with F (pi ) satisfying \u2202 ln\u2202x\n= \u03b1\u2212ln x\u2212(\u2212\nln Zx)1/\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\nwill lead to the famous stretched exponential distribution [28] pi = Z1 e\u2212(\u03b2Ei ) where Ei is positive energy of the\nsystem at state i, \u03b1 and \u03b2 the Lagrange multipliers related respectively to normalization and energy constraint\nPw\nF (x)\nU = i=1 F (pi )Ei . When \u03b3 = 1, we can recover \u2202 ln\u2202x\n= x1 as in BGS.\nIV. ADDITIVE IS FERMION DISTRIBUTION\n\nFor grand canonical ensemble, the same machinery as above leads to\n1 \u2212\u03b2(H\u2212\u03bcN )\ne\n(5)\nZ\nP\nP\nwith Z = [Tre\u2212q\u03b2(H\u2212\u03bcN ) ]1/q . Supposing U = j nj ej and N = j nj in accordance with the additivity assumption,\nthe average occupation number n of one-particle state of energy e can be straightforwardly calculated [12] :\n\u03c1=\n\nn=\n\n1\neq(e\u2212ef )/kT\n\n+1\n\n(6)\n\nwhich recovers FD distribution for q = 1. The Fermi energy can be calculated in the standard way. For 2-D systems,\ne.g., we have ef = ef0 + kq T ln(1 \u2212 e\u2212ef /kq T ). In Figure 2 is plotted the T -dependence of ef for different q values for\n1-D fermion systems. We see that ef considerably changes with decreasing q. From Eq.(6), we see that q-dependence\nof ef at given T will be similar to the T -dependence. The effect of q on other physical quantities (specific heat,\nelectrical conductivity, susceptibility, effective mass etc.) is discussed in [12].\nThe n distribution around the Fermi momentum kf can be estimated from Eq.(6) using e = h\u03042 k 2 /2m. We get :\nn=\n\n2 2\nq h\u0304 kf\n1\n[1 +\n(k \u2212 kf )]\n2\nkT m\n\n(7)\n\nwhich is similar to the analog given by a Monte-Carlo calculation based on a tight-binding Kondo lattice (KL) [7].\nqh\u0304k\nA comparison with [7] leads to Z = 2 f , where Z is the quasiparticle weight of photoemission spectrum. Note that\nZ is kf -dependent here. Eq.(7) tells us that decreasing q yields a flattening of n drop at ef .\nIn Figure 3 and 4, we compare the momentum distribution given by Eq.(6) for T =50 K to some numerical results\nof the momentum distribution of 1-D correlated electrons [6,8]. We see that, for about J < 1 and q > 0.003, KLM\ncalculations can be well reproduced by Eq.(6). But for smaller q or stronger coupling with J > 1, a long tail in the\nKLM distributions begins to develop at high energy and can not be reproduced by Eq.(6). At the same time, a new\nFermi surface at kf +\u03c0/2 starts to appear and a sharp n drop (energy cutoff) takes place at the new Fermi momentum.\nAll these strong correlation effects turn out to be completely absent within the present IS Fermion distribution. It\n3\n\n\fis clear that this discrepancy marks the limit of this formalism and perhaps implies that nonextensivity is no more\nnegligible in very strong-coupling case. It is worth noticing that the strong correlation effects, absent in additive IS\nfermion distribution, are just what we noted in nonextensive IS fermion distribution [15] plotted in Figure 1. This\nsuggests that a combination of these two IS generalizations of BGS, representing respectively two different aspect of\ncorrelation, may be an interesting approach leading to more generally valid statistical mechanics suitable for correlated\nparticle systems.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have compared several important generalizations of FD distribution to numerical and experimental results for\ncorrelated electron systems. It is found that the generalized fermion distributions based on incomplete information can\nbe useful for describing these systems. It is shown that the extensive IS fermion distribution gives a good description\nof correlated electrons in weak coupling regime. On the other hand, it fails to describe strongly correlated conduction\nelectrons and localized f -electrons which are possible to be described by the nonextensive IS fermion distribution.\nThe latter, though powerless for the description of weakly correlated electrons, shows similar behavior as the heavy\nelectrons in strong coupling regime : strong increase of ef and n-cutoff accompanied by a general decrease in n at all\nenergy up to ef . In a current work, we are trying to combine these two partially valid generalizations. Further results\nwill be presented in a future paper.\n\n[1] F. Mack and P.

The fermion density is chosen to give\ne0f = 1 eV for FD distribution at T = 0. We note that all these distributions show sharp n drop at Fermi energy ef . In addition,\nAD and KS distributions are only slightly different from the FD one even with q very different from unity and maximal \u03ba\nfar from zero. On the other hand, the nonextensive IS distribution changes drastically with decreasing q. We notice a wide\ndecrease of n and a strong increase of ef with decreasing q. As q \u2192 0, the occupation number tends to 1/2 (zero) for all states\nbelow (above) ef which increases up to 2 times ef0 , a fact shown by numerical calculations for strong correlated electrons.\n\nFIG. 2. T -dependence of Fermi momentum kf of the extensive IS fermion distribution in present work. The density of\nfermions is chosen to give kf0 = 0.25\u03c0 in the first Brillouin zone. The T -dependence of kf is in general not monotonic, in\ncontrast with the classical decreasing behavior of ef with increasing temperature. We notice that, at low temperature, kf shows\nan increase with increasing T .\n\nFIG. 3.

The density of electrons is chosen to give\nkf0 = 0.25\u03c0 in the first Brillouin zone. We note that IS distribution reproduces well the numerical results for about J < 1.\nWhen coupling is stronger, a long tail in the KLM distributions begins to develop at high energy.

At\nJ = 4, KLM distribution (x-marks) is very different from that of IS (e.g. q = 0.0011). The solid line fitting better the J = 4\nKLM distribution is given by the IS version of fractional exclusion distribution (1/n \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b1 (1/n \u2212 \u03b1 + 1)1\u2212\u03b1 = eq\u03b2(e\u2212ef ) [19,20]\n(1+\u03b1)/\u03b1\n1\nor n = q\u03b2(e\u2212e\n\u2212 q\u03b2(e\u2212e\n[24] with 1/\u03b1 = 0.85 due to the KLM occupation number smaller than 0.5 at low\nf)\nf )(1+\u03b1)/\u03b1\ne\n\nmomentum k.\n\n\u22121\n\ne\n\n\u22121\n\nFIG. 4.
