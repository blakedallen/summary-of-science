M. Varma\n\narXiv:0901.4758v2 [cond-mat.supr-con] 29 Apr 2009\n\nPhysics Department, University of California, Riverside, CA 92507\nIn a recent paper1 we have shown that the dissipation driven quantum phase transition of the\n2D xy model represents a universality class where the correlations at criticality is local in space\nand power law in time. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the model. The local criticality is\nbrought about by the decoupling of infrared singularities in space and time. The former leads to a\nKosterlitz Thouless transition whereby the excitations of the transverse component of the velocity\nfield (vortices) unbind in space. The latter on the other hand leads to a transition among excitations\n(warps) in the longitudinal component of the velocity field, which unbind in time. The quantum\nAshkin-Teller model, with which the observed loop order in the Cuprates is described maps in the\ncritical regime to the quantum xy model. We also discuss other models which are expected to have\nsimilar properties.\n\nThe dissipative quantum 2D xy model was\nintroduced2,3 to describe experiments on ultrathin\ngranular Superconducting films, where it was observed\nthat above a normal-state sheet resistance of order\nRQ = h/4e2 the resistivity does not decrease towards\n0 even at the lowest temperatures studied.4 . The\ngranular superconductor is represented by an array of\nislands with finite superfluid density with Josephson\ncoupling among the nearest neighbors. Dissipation of the\nCaldeira-Leggett5 form is included, whereby the phase\ndifference between the nearest neighbors is coupled to an\nexternal bosonic bath. the external bath effectively act\nas a resistor, R, shunting nearest neighbor islands and\nenergy is dissipated at the rate V 2 /R, where V is the\nvoltage drop which is proportional to the rate of change\nof the phase difference between the grains. A quantum\nphase transition occurs as the value of the resistance is\ntuned. For small values of the resistance, phase slips,\nwhereby a voltage develops across the junction between\ntwo grains, cost too much energy and so lead to an\nordered phase. On the other hand, for large value of the\nresistance, phase slip events are energetically favored\nand global superconductivity is destroyed.\nIn the absence of dissipation, the quantum model at\nT \u2192 0 maps to a 3d xy model. It was suggested that\nthe physics in the presence of dissipation may not be\ncontinuously connected to the 3d xy universality class6 .\nIt was also suggested that there is a possibility that the\nsingularity introduced by dissipation may be linked to\na transition driven by the unbinding in time of phase\nslips7 . The calculations are done in the weak coupling\nregime where one considers the Josephson coupling perturbatively. The same approach was previously used to\nstudy the phase transition and correlation functions2,7,8 .\nArguments were given also that the critical fluctuations\ndue to the unbinding of the phase slips in time which\nhave long-time singularities may be local in space2 . However later work by some of the same authors presents a\nrather different picture9 . Moreover none of these investigations into the dissipative transition are applicable near\nthe critical point.\n\nIn a previous paper we have shown that the the quantum phase transition is obtained due to the proliferation of a new kind of excitation, which we termed warps,\nwhose physics is indeed related to the phase slips in time;\nmore specifically they represent events in time where\na change in the longitudinal component of the velocity\nfield1 occur. The possibility that the longitudinal component may lead to the introduction of sources and sinks\nwhich control the critical behavior was also recently emphasized in the context of one dimensional systems10,11 .\nThe correct identification of the relevant degrees of freedom in higher dimensions turns out to be interesting.\nThe introduction of warps simplifies the analysis of the\nproblem so that the correlation function of the order parameter can be obtained near the critical point. We find\nspatially local correlations with an infrared divergence\n(\u221d 1/t) in temporal correlations at the critical point.\nWe also the cross-over from the quantum critical to the\nquantum-regime.\nThe motivation for this study is that the existence of\nsuch a critical point naturally explains some of the most\nimportant features of the phase diagram of the Cuprate\nsuperconductors. Polarized neutron scattering12,13,14,15\nin three distinct family of Cuprates have confirmed previous finding in a third family of Cuprates through dichroism in Angle Resolved Photoemission spectra16 , which\nreported the observation of time reversal violation in the\npseudogapped phase of underdoped cuprates. In particular, the experiments lend support to the idea that\nthe ground state in the pseudogapped regime is one\nwith ordered current loops without loss of translation\nsymmetry.17,18,19 . The low energy sector of this theory\ncontains four states that are related by time reversal and\nreflection along the x or y axis. Alternatively, the four\nstates can be represented by two Ising variable in each\nunit cell, the \u00b1 values representing currents in the x and\ny directions. A classical statistical mechanical model for\nsuch degrees of freedom that supports a phase transition\nwithout any divergence in the specific heat20,21 is the\nAshkin-Teller model22 . Such a model is known to undergo a Gaussian phase transition23 . A quantum gener-\n\n\f2\nalization of the classical model in terms of operators that\ninduce fluctuations within the low energy phase space of\nthe four states, leads to the dissipative 2D xy model studied here. The local criticality with a 1/t singularity is the\nfluctuation spectrum necessary to explain the anomalous\nproperties in a number of properties such a resistivity,\nnuclear relaxation rate and optical conductivity in the\nnormal state near optimal doping24 abutting the pseudogapped phase. At long wavelengths, such correlations\nare directly observed by Raman scattering experiments.\nRecently, we have also shown that such fluctuations couple to fermions to promote pairing in the d-symmetry\nchannel.25\nIt is worth pointing out that a number of classical statistical mechanical models such as the 6-vertex and 8vertex models also have Gaussian criticality in part of\ntheir phase diagram, as well as phase transitions which\ndo not manifest any anomaly in their specific heat. Such\nmodels when augmented with ohmic dissipation do belong to the same universality class considered here. Local quantum criticality happens also to be a hallmark\nof the quantum phase transitions in heavy fermions26,27 ,\nalthough it is not clear to us how the class of models\nsolved here may be connected to the microscopic models\nfor heavy fermions.\nThis paper is organized as follows: The dissipative\nquantum XY model and the Villain transformation are\ndiscussed in sec II. In section III, we show how dissipation changes the critical properties of the model. We\nshow that the action can be written in a quadratic form in\nterms of two orthogonal topological excitations, vortices\nwhich interact only in space and warps which interact\nonly in time. We also discuss the difficulties in analyzing\nthe model based on other choice of variables. In sec IV\nwe discuss the properties of the warps. Sec V deals with\nthe scaling equations for the vortices and warps and the\nphase transition which occurs through the proliferation\nof warps. In sec VI we present a detailed calculation of\nthe fluctuation spectra near the quantum critical point.\n\n\uf8ee\n\nexp \uf8f0\u2212\u03b2J\n\nX\nhiji\n\n\uf8f9\n\n[1 \u2212 cos (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )]\uf8fb \u2248\n\nX\nmij\n\nwhere mij are integers that live on the links of the original\nsquare lattice. On a square lattice we choose to identify\neach site as i = x, y where x and y are integers. We can\ncombine the two link variables mx,y;x+1,y and mx,y;xy+1\ninto one two component vector mx,y that lives on the site\nx, y of the lattice. The choice is purely for convenience\nand none of the results depend on how one chooses to\norganize the degrees of freedom of the model. Instead of\nintroducing a new field to linearize the quadratic term via\n\nThe spectra has the same form as that proposed to explain the normal state marginal fermi-liquid properties\nof the high Tc cuprates. In sec VII we present the zero\ntemperature phase diagram. The connection to Ashkin\nTeller model and cuprates is presented in sec VIII. The\neffect of fourfold anisotropy on the critical properties is\nanayzed in sec IX. In sec X we show how dissipation\narises in cuprates. In sec XI we discuss other forms of\ndissipation and how they may lead to different forms of\nsingularities in the fluctuation spectra.\n\nI.\n\nDISSIPATIVE QUANTUM 2DXY MODEL\n\nThe classical 2d xy model consists of U (1) degrees of\nfreedom, represented by an angle \u03b8, living on the sites\nof a regular lattice, assumed to be a square lattice here,\nwith a nearest neighbor interaction of the form\nH=J\n\nX\nhiji\n\n[1 \u2212 cos (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere J is Josephson coupling.\nSince a continuous symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken in two\ndimensions28,29 , this model does not support a long range\nordered phase. Nevertheless a phase transition does occur at finite temperature where the correlation function\nof the order parameter e\u0131\u03b8 changes from exponential to\npower law. This is the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii\ntransition30,31 . The physics of this phase transition is\nbetter understood in terms of the topological defects of\nthe system. To do so we follow the standard procedure of\nusing the Villain transform and integrating out the phase\ndegrees of freedom. We include the algebra here so as to\nmake the later discussion of the quantum version easier\nto follow.\nThe Villain transformation expresses the periodic function in terms of a periodic Gaussian:\n\n\uf8ee\n\nexp \uf8f0\u2212\u03b2J\n\nX\nhiji\n\n2\n\n\uf8f9\n\n(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j \u2212 2\u03c0mij ) /2\uf8fb ,\n\n(2)\n\nthe Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, we follow an\nalternative procedure. We expand the quadratic term\nand transform to Fourier space. Keeping the leading\nquadratic term \u03b8x,y \u2212 \u03b8x+1,y \u2248 \u2212a\u2207x \u03b8xy , where a is the\nlattice constant we get\n\n\u03b8xy \u2212 \u03b8x+1,y \u2212 2\u03c0mxx,y\n\n\u00012\n\n\u2248 a2 \u22072x \u03b8xy + 4\u03c0a\u2207x \u03b8xy mxx,y\n+ 4\u03c0 2 mx2\nx,y ,\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\nwhere mxx,y is the x component of the vector field given\nby the integer mx,y;x+1,y . Fourier transforming and integrating out the field \u03b8k in terms of which the action is\nquadratic we get\n\nZ\u2248\n\nX\nm\n\n\"\n\nexp \u22124\u03b2J\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\nk 2 m * mk \u2212 (k * mk )2\ndk\nk2\n\n##\n\n+ mx+1,y;x+1,y+1 \u2212 mx,y;x,y+1 .\nIn this model, a phase transition occurs from a state at\nhigh temperatures where the vortices are free to a low\ntemperature state where they are bound in pairs.\nWe now turn to the description of the Quantum version of the 2d xy model. First we consider the model in\nthe absence of dissipation. The quantum 2d xy model\nis written in terms of operators \u03b8 and its conjugate, the\nnumber operator n. The Hamiltonian is of the form\n\n.\n\n(4)\nCombining the two terms and Fourier transforming to\nreal space we get\n\nZ\u2248\n\nX\nm\n\n\"\n\nexp \u2212\u03b2J\n\nXX\nr\n\nr\u2032\n\n#\n\n(\u2207 \u00d7 mr ) * (\u2207 \u00d7 mr\u2032 ) log |r \u2212 r\u2032 | .\n\n(5)\nSince the vector field is two dimensional the curl is a\nscalar and is the vorticity of the vector field. Defining\ninteger charges \u2207 \u00d7 mr = \u03c1r we get the standard action\nof the two dimensional coloumb gas. On the lattice this\ndefinition is equivalent to\n\u03c1x,y = mx,y+1;x+1,y+1 \u2212 mx,y;x+1,y\n\nZ=\n.\n\nZ\n\n\uf8ee\n\nD\u03b8i (\u03c4 ) exp \uf8f0\u2212\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03b2\n\n\uf8eb\n\nd\u03c4 \uf8ed\n\nZ \u2248\n\nm\n\n\uf8ee\nX\nexp \uf8f0\n\u22124\u03c0 2 J\u2206\u03c4 m * m\n\nXC\n\n(9)\n\nk,\u03c9\n\n#\n4\u03c0 2 J 2 ca2 \u2206\u03c4 2 (k * m)2\n+\n,\n(Ca2 /c\u2206\u03c4 ) \u03c9 2 + Jca2 \u2206\u03c4 k 2\nwhere c = a/\u2206\u03c4 . Rearranging terms as before we get\n\nZ=\n\nX\nm\n\n\uf8ee\nX\nexp \uf8f0\n\u22124\u03c0 2 J\nk,\u03c9\n\n2\n\nX\nX n2\ni\ncos (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) ,\n\u2212J\n2C\ni\n\n(7)\n\nhiji\n\nwhere C is the capacitance and [ni , \u03b8j ] = i\u03b4ij . Since\nni = i\u2202/\u2202\u03b8i , the first term is the kinetic energy of the\nphase with a mass C. There is competition between the\nkinetic energy and the potential energy terms, the former\nminimized by a state where \u03b8i is disordered stabilizing\nan insulating phase while the latter minimized by a fixed\nvalue of \u03b8i stabilizing a superconductor. The partition\nfunction can be recast in the form\n\n(6)\n\nAt T = 0, the (imaginary) time direction becomes infinite\nin extent, and the model is in the 3d xy universality class.\nThe dualization procedure used for the classical 2d xy\nmodel can now be implemented on the 3d xy action as\nwell. First we discretize the imaginary time direction\nin units of \u2206\u03c4 and work on a three dimensional lattice.\nIntroducing the variables m which only live on the spatial\nlinks, the action is\nX\n\nH=\n\ni\n\n2\n\n\u0001\n2\n\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03b8i \u2212 J\n\nX\nhiji\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n\ncos (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )\uf8f8\uf8fb\n\n(8)\n\nwhere J \u2192 Ja2 \u2206\u03c4 , C \u2192 Ca2 /\u2206\u03c4 and m \u2192 m/a. The\nisotropic model is recovered\np when the discretization in\ntime is such that \u2206\u03c4 =\nC/J. Combining \u2207 \u00d7 m\n(which is a scalar since m is two dimensional) and \u2202m/\u2202\u03c4\ninto one three dimensional field we see that eqn.10 is\nthe partition function for the three dimensional loop gas\nmodel which is in the same universality class as the 3d\nxy model32 . A point to note here is that a vector field\ncoupling via a three dimensional kernel does undergo a\nphase transition while a scalar field does not33 . Alternatively, the loop gas model undergoes a 3d xy transition\nwhile the three dimensional Coloumb gas is always in a\ndisordered phase.\nAlternate derivations34 map the model directly to the\n3d xy model instead of the loop gas model. We find\nthat the procedure described above is preferable in the\npresence of dissipation.\n\n!\uf8f9\nIn the dissipative 2d xy model, one adds to eqn.8 a\n\uf8fb , term which generates in the equations of motion of the\nphase variable a term proportional to the velocity, \u03b8\u0307.

For a single\nJosephson junction the voltage drop is given by \u2202(\u03b81 \u2212\n\u03b82 )/\u2202\u03c4 . The power dissipated by a resistor connecting\nthe two superconducting grains is (\u2202(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 )/\u2202\u03c4 )2 /R.\nIntegrating over time one obtains total energy dissipated\nthrough the resistor. For an array of junctions the corresponding term in the action is of the form in eqn.11.\nSuch a dissipative term can also be derived by assuming\nthat the phase difference across every junction is coupled\nto an external bath of harmonic oscillators.

For a\nlinear spectral density \u03b7 = 1 and a Ohmic dissipation\nis obtained5 . It is indeed interesting to ask what other\nforms of dissipation is allowed. We will postpone the\ndiscussion of the effect of such dissipative terms to section\nX.\n\nII.\n\nEXCITATIONS OF THE QUANTUM 2D XY\nMODEL\n\nWe can now carry through the program of introducing\nthe vector field m for the quantum 2d xy model with\nOhmic dissipation (\u03b7 = 1). The integration of the \u03b8\nfields can be performed since the dissipative term is also\nquadratic.

The action in Eqn.13\nhas two possible phase transitions, depending on whether\nthe capacitance C or the dissipation term \u221d \u03b1 in the\nnumerator of the second term in Eq. (13) dominates\nin long wavelength and low frequency limit. The former\ncorresponds a critical point with the dynamic critical z =\n1, i.e. we recover the loop gas model which belongs to\nthe 3d xy universality class. The latter corresponds, as\nwe will show to z = \u221e, i.e. a fixed point with local\ncriticality. The two terms have the same scaling form for\nz = 2. In the rest of the paper we analyze the dissipation\ndriven transition\n\nThe vector field m can be written as a sum of a longitudinal, ml , and a transverse component, mt which by\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2212\ndefinition satisfy \u2207 \u00d7ml = 0 and \u2207 *mt = 0. The vorticity field \u03c1v (r, \u03c4 ) is related to the transverse component\nalone and is given by\n\nX\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u03b4 (r \u2212 ri ) \u03b4 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4i ) ,\n\u2207 \u00d7 mt (r, \u03c4 ) = \u03c1v (r, \u03c4 ) = \u03c1vc\ni\n\n(14)\n\nwhere (ri , \u03c4i ) are the location of the core of the vortices\nand \u03c1vc is the quantized charge of the vortex.\nUnlike the z = 1 theory where dm/d\u03c4 is the two component current that acts as the additional topological\ndefect, we find that the topological excitation in terms of\nwhich the problem with dissipation is most conveniently\ndiscussed involves only the longitudinal component and\nis given by a \"warp\" field \u03c1w (r, \u03c4 ) defined through a nonlocal relation in space,\n\ndml (r, \u03c4 )\n=\nd\u03c4\n\nZ\n\nd2 R\u03c1w (R, \u03c4 )\n\nr\u2212R\n\n|r \u2212 R|3\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\n\f5\n2\n\n\u03c1w are events where the longitudinal component\nchanges (see Fig.1). The warp charge \u03c1wc is defined by\n\u03c1w (R, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u00d7 |\u03c1w (k\u03c9n )| .\nwhere\n\nX\nc\n\u03b4(R \u2212 Ri )\u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4i ),\n\u03c1wc\n2\u03c0\ni\n\n(16)\n\nin a way analogous to the definition of the vortex charge\n\u03c1vc above. We will show in Sec. (III) that the warpcharge is also quantized.\nGiven Eq.(15), the relation between the Fouriertransformed warp field \u03c1w (k, \u03c9n ) and the longitudinal\ncomponent of the velocity field is\n\u0131\u03c9n\nk * ml (\u03c9n , \u03c4 ) = \u03c1w (k, \u03c9n )\nck\n\n(17)\n\nJ\n\nWarp\n\nFIG. 1: A \"warp\" is an event in time where the divergence of\nm field changes\n\nIn terms of \u03c1v , \u03c1w , the action, in the continuum limit,\n\u2032\nneatly splits into three parts: S = Sv + Sw + Sw\n1 X J\n2\n|\u03c1v (k\u03c9n )|\n(18)\nL2 \u03b2\nk2\n1 X \u03b1\n2\n= 2\n|\u03c1w (k\u03c9n )|\nL \u03b2\n4\u03c0 |\u03c9|\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 X\n\u03b1Jt |\u03c9n | \u03b12 k 2\n= 2\n\u2212\nG (k, \u03c9n ) JJt \u2212\nL \u03b2\n4\u03c0c\n16\u03c0 2\n\nG (k, \u03c9n ) =\n\nJck 2\n\n1\n+ (C/c) \u03c9n2 + \u03b1 |\u03c9n | k 2\n\n(19)\n\nThe factorization of the action in eqn.18 is only possible due to the choice of variables made in eqn.17. With\nthis choice, it follows from Eq.(18) there are logarithmically interacting vortex charges in space with local\ninteractions in time, and a logarithmically interacting\nwarps in time with local interactions in space. The\nformer is the standard Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii\ntheory30,31 while the latter is the charge representation\nof the Kondo problem36 near the Ferromagnet/AntiFerromagnet quantum critical point. Quite unlike the\nz = 1 theory where Lorentz invariance is manifest, the\nspace and time degrees of freedom are completely decoupled in the theory describing the dissipation driven\ntransition. Being orthogonal the charges \u03c1v and \u03c1w are\nuncoupled; the action is a product of the action over configurations of \u03c1v and of \u03c1w . Any physical correlations are\ndetermined by correlations of both charges. The third\n\u2032\npiece of the action Sw\nis nonsingular because it corresponds to the three dimensional Coloumb gas problem\nwhich is known to be disordered at all temperatures33 .\nThe singularity induced by the presence of Ohmic dissipation is transparent in our formulation. Suppose, one\nworks instead with the degrees of freedom appropriate to\nthe 2+1 d xy model which are the vortex density \u03c1v and\nthe vortex current, Jv . The latter is defined as\n\nSv =\nSw\n\u2032\nSw\n\nJv = \u1e91 \u00d7\n\ndm\nd\u03c4\n\n(20)\n\nThe action in eqn.13 is\n\n\uf8ee\nX\nJv * Jv (C/c)\nJc |\u03c1v (k\u03c9)|2\n\u2212 4\u03c0 2 J\nZ=\nexp \uf8f0\n\u2212 4\u03c0 2 J\n2\n2\n2\n(C/c) \u03c9n + Jck + \u03b1 |\u03c9n | k\n(C/c) \u03c9n2 + Jck 2 + \u03b1 |\u03c9n | k 2\nm\nk,\u03c9\n#\n\u0001\nJv * Jv \u03b1k 2 / |\u03c9n |\n2\n\u2212 4\u03c0 J\n,\n(C/c) \u03c9n2 + Jck 2 + \u03b1 |\u03c9n | k 2\nX\n\nThe first two terms can be combined to give the dual\nrepresentation of the 3dxy model. In the absence of dissipation, these terms lead to the superconductor to insulator phase transition. The third term introduces a new\nsingularity in the vortex currents. Due to the continuity\nequation between \u03c1v and Jv , see below, the two singu-\n\n(21)\n\nlarities cannot be decoupled as before and the analysis of\nthe model is not straightforward.\nIn terms of warps and vortices the vector field can be\nwritten as,\nm = \u03c1v \u1e91 \u00d7 \u0131k/k 2 + \u03c1w ck\u0302/\u0131\u03c9\n\n(22)\n\n\f6\nand\nJv = \u2212\u03c1v \u03c9k/k 2 + \u03c1w \u1e91 \u00d7 ck\u0302\n\n(23)\n\nSeparating the longitudinal and transverse components\nof the vector field m and the vector current Jv allows us\nto factorize the action. Notice that the new term in the\nvector current is transverse and the continuity equation.\nd\u03c1v /d\u03c4 + \u2207 * Jv = 0 is satisfied.\nSince warps are excitation that introduce longitudinal components in the vector field, alternate formulations\ncould have been considered. In particular, we could have\nchosen to define monopoles (sources and sinks in two dimensions) which are of the form\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2207 * m = \u03c1m\n\n(24)\n\nSuch excitations determine the longitudinal component\nof the vector field and their relation to warps in momentum space is,\n\n\u03c1m (\u03c9, k) =\n\nck\n\u03c1w (\u03c9, k) .\n\u03c9\n\n(25)\n\nIn terms of monopoles one cannot separate the singularities and the simple description of the dissipation driven\ntransition is no longer possible. The physics remains\nsame as the scaling dimension of monopoles and warps is\nthe same. We choose to work with warps as the analysis\nis more transparent and we do not have to consider the\nadded complication of the renormalization of velocity.\nIII.\n\nWARPS AS TOPOLOGICAL DEFECTS IN\nSPACE TIME\n\nIn this section we discuss the topological properties\nand the physical content of the warps. The definitions in\nEqs. (17) and (15) say that the warps are source for the\nlongitudinal component of the vector field m. Since m is\nan integer vector field, it is important also to show that\nthis property is preserved by Eq. (15) as well as that the\nwarp-charge \u03c1wc is quantized.\nLet us first review the familiar case of the vortex in\nEqn.26. In real space the vector field mt due to a vortex\nat Ri is\n\nmt (r, \u03c4 ) = \u03c1vc\n\nzb \u00d7 (r \u2212 Ri )\n|r \u2212 Ri |\n\n2\n\n(26)\n\nGiven the integer vector field m the vortex is defined by\nits quantized charge \u03c1vc and the singular azimuthal vector field \u221d 1/r. This vector field is undefined inside a core\nradius a where the source of the velocity field with discrete charge \u03c1vc sits. The discreteness of mt is respected\nonce such a singularity is identified. In particular, the\n\ncorresponding \u03b8 field has a discontinuity along a line going from the core out to infinity. One can then proceed\nto the continuum to analyze the critical properties of the\nmodel .\nWe see from the solution of Eq. (15) that the field ml\ndue to a warp created at site Ri and time \u03c4i has the form:\nml (r, \u03c4 ) = c\u03c1wc \u0398(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4i )\n\nr \u2212 Ri\n|r \u2212 Ri |3\n\n(27)\n\nAnalogous to the vortex, this solution is a quantized\ncharge in a core which serves as the source of a radial\nvelocity field falling off as 1/r2 . To see this consider the\nsolution to eq.17 with m = \u2207\u03b8,\n\u0012\n\u03b8 (r, \u03c4 ) = \u0398 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4i ) 2\u03c0n\n\n\u0013\na\n+ \u03b8c , |r \u2212 Ri | \u2265 a\n|r \u2212 Ri |\n= \u0398 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4i ) \u03b8c , |r \u2212 Ri | < a\n(28)\n\nThe boundary conditions chosen are \u03b8(|r \u2212 Ri | = a) =\n\u03b8c + 2\u03c0n and \u03b8 (|r \u2212 Ri | = \u221e) = \u03b8c . The first guarantees the quantization of the warp charge, imposed by the\nphase jump of 2\u03c0n that occurs at |r \u2212 Ri | = a. In other\nwords a warp is an event which produces a discrete phase\njump across the core. The corresponding discontinuity in\nthe phase is discrete, corresponding to a discrete ml field\nlocalized along a loop encircling the core. This localized\ndiscrete ml serves as the source of the radial ml field\noutside the core. As one moves along any radial direction crossing this loop, which defines the boundary of the\ncore, the phase jumps by 2\u03c0n. Thus the warp charge is\ndiscrete and satisfies the constraint that the vector field\nm is discrete. The second boundary condition where is\nchosen because we are only describing the changes with\nrespect to the fields because of the warp event at \u03c4 = \u03c4i .\nIV.\n\nDISSIPATION DRIVEN PHASE\nTRANSITION\n\nThe action for the warps, Eq. (18), has been studied\nbefore in the context of quantum coherence of two state\nsystem coupled to dissipative baths37,38 . Let us introduce\na core-energy \u2206 for the \u03c1w 's just as is done to control\nthe fugacity of \u03c1v 's, the vortices. Next consider how the\nrenormalization of \u03b1 and \u2206 proceeds.39 . Including the\ncore-energy, the action Sw is\n\"\n#\nZ\nX \u03b1 1\nX\n2\n2\nT\nSw =\n|\u03c1wi (\u03c9n )| + d\u03c4 \u2206 |\u03c1wi (\u03c4 )| .\n4\u03c0 |\u03c9n |\nn\ni\n(29)\nThe RG equations for eqn.29 are well known36,37,38,40\ne\nd\u2206\ne\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2206\ndl\nd\u03b1\ne 2,\n= \u2212\u03b1\u2206\ndl\n\n(30)\n\n\f7\ne = \u2206\u03c4c and \u03c4c \u2248 (2J2 E)\u22121/2 is the short time\nwhere \u2206\ne\ncutoff. The critical point of interest is at \u03b1c = 1, where \u2206\nscales to 0; for \u03b1 < 1 the charges \u03c1w freely proliferate as\ne becomes effective. \u03b1 > 1 represents\n\"screening\" due to \u2206\nthe ordered or confined region. We are interested here\nonly in the region \u03b1 \u2264 1. Well in the quantum critical\nregion, the (singular part of the) propagator for \u03c1w is\n\u22121\n\nh\u03c1w (\u03c9n ) \u03c1w (\u2212\u03c9n )i = (1/4\u03c0 |\u03c9n | \u03c4c )\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\nNote that the form of the propagator in eqn.31 is valid\nonly at the critical point. The crossover to the quantumdisordered or screened state is given for T = 0 when\n\u03c9 = \u03c9x which is of the order of the inverse of the characteristic screening time, which may be estimated similarly\nto Kosterlitz's estimate41 of the screening length in the\nxy-problem:\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u03c9x \u2248 \u03c4c\u22121 exp \u2212b/ 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ,\n(32)\n\nwhere b is a numerical constant of O(1). At finite temperatures and low frequencies, the crossover temperature\nTx is of O(\u03c9x ). On the ordered side \u03b1 > \u03b1c , we have to\nconsider the effect of the charging energy and the flow\nto the z = 1 critical point. In fig.2 we plot the phase\ndiagram in the T \u2212 \u03b1 plane where only the the region\n\u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1c is correctly described. The crossover line is also\nshown where well above Tx we expect to observe critical\nbehavior controlled by the quantum critical point while\nbelow Tx the system is phase disordered and hence an\ninsulator.\n\nTx\n\nT\n\n1/\u03b1\n\nFIG. 2: Dissipative driven proliferation of warps occurs for\n1/\u03b1 > 1.

We need to include it\nin our calculations to reproduce the correlation functions\nin the absence of dissipation. Since m is two dimensional\nvector, the contribution is only from the space like segment of the path chosen. We can now proceed as before.\nGoing over to imaginary time implies that the factor of\n\u0131 is absorbed in the definition of the path integral.\nj\u03bd\n\u03c4\n\ni\u03bc\n\nFIG. 3: Path between i\u03bc and j\u03bd used to compute the correlation function.\n\nTo compute the correlation function we introduce a field\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03b7 i\u03bc that lives on the sites of the space time lattice.

The term independent of vortices and warps is\nthe spin wave contribution. Notice that the associated\npropagator is three dimensional and as such is non singular. This reproduces the well known result that spin\nwaves do not disorder the long range order in three dimensions. The other two contributions come from vortices (the last line in eqn.37) and warps. At the dissipative critical point, the singular fluctuations are associated with the warps. Thus the vortices and spin wave\ncontributions are completely regular. To compute the\ncontribution from the warps we follow a procedure similar to Jose et al. (23 ).

The first term in the square\nbrackets in eqn.42 is from the time like segment of the\npath; the second term corresponds to the space like segment of the path and the last term is an interference term\nbetween the two. At the critical point the correlation of\nthe warps is given by eqn.31. Consider the space like segment. It is singular (of the form (1/ |\u03c9n |)) as \u03c9 goes to\nzero. This implies F \u2192 \u221e and the correlation function\nis zero unless ri = rj . Thus the correlation function is\nlocal. For ri = rj the last two terms are zero and only\nthe time like path contributes to the correlation function.\nPerforming the integral over momentum k, the correlation function is given by C(0, \u03c4 \u2212\u03c4 \u2032 ) \u221d exp(\u2212F (0, \u03c4 \u2212\u03c4 \u2032 )),\n\n\f9\n\nX 1 \u2212 cos (\u03c9n (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 ))\nlog (|\u03c9n | \u03c4c ) .\n|\u03c9n |\nn\n(43)\nTo perform the matsubara sum we consider the analytic\nproperties of the logarithm in eqn.43.

In particular using the calculation by Ghaemi\net al.42 , the spectral function of the correlation is\n\u22121\nIm\u03c7(q, \u03c9) = \u03c4\u0304c tanh(\u03c9/2T ), \u03c9 <\n\u223c \u03c4c .\n\n(45)\n\n\u03c4\u0304c is O(\u03c4c ). The order parameter correlation at \u03b1 = 1\nis local in space and power law in time. Thus the dissipative 2DXY model describes a new type of quantum\ncriticality where the correlations are local in space and\nare functions of \u03c9/T , with a cut-off provided above. Precisely such criticality had been postulated to describe the\n\"Strange metal\" or marginal fermi-liquid region of the\nphase diagram of high temperature superconductors24 .\nZERO TEMPERATURE PHASE DIAGRAM\n\nSo far we have concentrated on the dissipation driven\ntransition. We now consider the phase diagram in the\nJC \u2212\u03b1 plane. Our analysis clearly shows that the physics\nat finite dissipation and at zero dissipation cannot be continuously connected. This is in accord with the suggestion in Ref.( 6), that the zero dissipation limit, described\nby the 3d\u2212xy model at zero temperature, is in a different\nuniversality class compared to the model at infinitesimal\ndissipation. The other limit where the physics is easy to\nanalyze is at infinite dissipation. In this case, the fluctuations in time are energetically unfavored and the model\nmaps to a 2D \u2212 xy model. We now make a guess on the\nstructure of the rest of the phase diagram based on the\nwell-defined theory in the limits discussed.\nIn reference [6] it is argued that a weak coupling analysis shows that the entire Josephson coupling renormalizes\nto zero at small dissipation. Furthermore a self consistent calculation allows one to map the phase boundary\nwithin this scheme. Such an analysis does not capture\nthe physics of topological defects that are necessary to\ndetermine the entire phase diagram. Given our identification of the relevant degrees of freedom and the fugacities associated with the new excitations, we propose an\n\nAlgebraic\n2DXY\n\nVI.\n\nalternative understanding of the physics of the dissipative\n2d \u2212 xy model.\nWe have explicitly shown above that the critical theory\nhas two independent singularities. Thus the true phase\ndiagram can be determined by studying the flow of stiffness, fugacity of vortices and fugacity of warps. The only\nalgebraically ordered phase is one in which both the vortices and warps are bound. This occurs for 1/\u03b1 < 1 and\nJC > 2/\u03c0. Furthermore this phase is continuously connected to the 2d XY phase at infinite dissipation. Thus\none expects a phase boundary to exist that starts at\nJC = \u221e and \u03b1 = 1 and approachesJC = 0 and \u03b1 = \u221e\nasymptotically as shown in fig.4. For 1/\u03b1 > 1 the fugacity of warps grows and the stiffness vanishes. Similarly,\nfor JC < 2/\u03c0 the vortices proliferate driving the stiffness\nto zero. We find no evidence for the ordered phase for\nsmall JC and \u03b1 > 1 as in reference [6] where the large\nfugacity of the vortices was ignored. Similarly, for large\nJC a minimum value of \u03b1 is required to overcome the\nfugacity of the warps. In other words for any given value\nof JC as one increases \u03b1 the fugacity of warps, which\nis infinite at infinitesimal \u03b1, remains large until we cross\nthe phase boundary, upon which it renormalizes to zero.\nWhether the resulting phase is algebraically ordered or\nnot depends on the fugacity of vortices.\n\nJC\nDisordered\n\n3DXY\n\nwhere\n\n1/a\nFIG. 4: The zero temperature phase diagram in the 1/\u03b1 \u2212 JC\nplane for the dissipative 2DXY model. For \u03b1 = 0, the system undergoes a superconductor to insulator phase transition\nwith a 3DXY critical point. For infinite \u03b1, the dynamics is\nquenched and the we recover the 2DXY behavior. There are\ntwo phases for finite dissipation. The disordered phase is characterized with a diverging fugacity of warps and vortices. The\nalgebraically ordered phase is one in which both the vortices\nand warps are bound, and the correlations are power laws\nseparately in space and time with continuously varying exponents.\n\nConsider the regime where warps proliferate. The vanishing stiffness implies that such excitations should also\n\n\f10\nlead to screening in the interaction of the vortices. In\nanalogy with the disordered phase in the KT theory, we\nshould introduce a mass for both vortices and warps.\nThis in turn will lead to unbinding of vortices as well.\nWe believe that for small JC, this proliferation of warps\nand resultant screening of interaction among vortices will\npush the phase boundary away from \u03b1 = 1 to larger values of \u03b1. At large JC we expect our theory to be valid\nand a dissipation driven transition will occur at \u03b1 = 1.\nA schematic phase diagram in shown in fig.4.\nAt first sight it might appear that a long range interac2\ntion in time of the form 1/ |\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 | is inconsistent with\na disordered ground state, where the correlation function decays faster than the interaction. The reason such\na state is allowed is the fact that the existence of excitations which correspond to phase slip events in time\nintroduces a second time scale in the problem. The competition between the short time scale physics associated\nwith the fugacity of the warps and the long range interaction between them is precisely the reason for the observed\nphase transition.\n\nVII.\n\n+1\n\nJ\n\n-1\n\nF\n+1\n\n-1\n\nCu\n\nO\n\nFIG. 5: The four domains of the circulating current phase\nis shown. They can be parameterized by two Ising variables\nwhich represent the currents in the x and y directions.\n\nASHKIN TELLER MODEL AND THE\nCUPRATES\n\nIn reference [1] we have argued that the long wavelength theory of a model for the Pseudogap state for the\nCuprate superconductors is the Ashkin-Teller model, The\nquantum version of this model with dissipation is in the\nuniversality class of dissipative quantum 2d \u2212 xy model.\nThe Marginal Fermi Liquid24 properties of the optimally\ndoped system originate from the fluctuation spectrum\nof the local quantum critical point. In this model the\nphase variable \u03b8 represents the possible current loop order within a given unit cell and the four fold anisotropy\nrestricts it to four values representing states that break\ntime reversal and one of two possible reflection symmetries. The origin of the dissipation in this system is due to\nthe coupling of the order parameter, which corresponds\nto the coherent part of the current operator, to the incoherent part of the current operator which correspond\nto fermions near the Fermi surface. For long-wavelength\nfluctuations such a coupling leads to Ohmic dissipation of\nthe form in eqn.11, while term of the form in eqn.56(see\nbelow) is not generated. Detailed derivation of the long\nwavelength theory will be provided in a later publication.\nThe classical Ashkin Teller model is defined in terms of\ntwo Ising degrees of freedom per unit cell. If we define \u03c3i\nand \u03c4i as Ising variables taking \u00b11 values to parameterize\nthe currents along the the x and y direction, the four\nresulting states in each unit-cell (see fig.5) form the basis\nof the low energy sector of the long wavelength theory.\nThe Hamiltonian of the classical Ashkin Teller model is22\nHAT = \u2212\n\nX\n\n<ij>\n\n[J2 (\u03c3i \u03c3j + \u03c4i \u03c4j ) + J4 \u03c3i \u03c3j \u03c4i \u03c4j ]\n\n(46)\n\nFor J4 = 0 the model reduces to two decoupled Ising\nmodels which is known to undergo a Gaussian phase\ntransition43 . The analysis has been extended to map\nout the entire phase diagram by observing that J4 is a\nmarginal operator in this theory44 . For \u22121 < J4 /J2 < 1\nthe system undergoes a Gaussian phase transition form a\nferromagnetically ordered state to a paramagnetic state\nwith continuously varying exponents. Quite remarkable,\nfor \u22121 < J4 /J2 < 0, the specific heat exponent \u03b1 is\nnegative. The Ashkin Teller model explains why no\nsingularity is observed in specific heat measurements at\nthe pseudogap temperature accompanying the breaking\nof time reversal symmetry. Defining \u03c3i = cos (\u03b8i ) and\n\u03c4i = sin (\u03b8i ) we can rewrite the Hamiltonian as\nHAT = \u2212\n\nX\n\n[2J2 cos (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) + J4 cos (2\u03b8i \u2212 2\u03b8j )]\n\n<ij>\n\n(47)\nwhere \u03b8i 's take values \u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4 and 7\u03c0/4.

On increasing temperature, it\nundergoes a Gaussian transition into a state which can be\ndescribed by proliferation of vortices. It is a unique property of four fold anisotropy that the disordering, which\noccurs via proliferation of vortices, and ordering, which\nis enforced by a diverging anisotropy field, happen at the\nsame temperature23 . We now analyze the effect of such\nan anisotropy field on the local quantum\nP critical point.\nTo do so we introduce the term H4 = i h4 cos (4\u03b8i ) in\nthe Hamiltonian. To handle such a term in the action we\nemploy the following approximation scheme\neh4 cos(4\u03b8i ) \u2248\n\nX\n\n2\n\neln(y4 )pi +\u01314pi \u03b8i ,\n\n(49)\n\npi\n\n=\n\nFIG. 6: Equations for he full Greens function.

Defining Gp =\nhp (k, \u03c9) p (\u2212k, \u2212\u03c9)i and Gw = h\u03c1w (k, \u03c9) \u03c1w (\u2212k, \u2212\u03c9)i,\nsymbolically the equation satisfied by Gp can be written\nas\n\nwhere pi is an integer field that lives at each site and\ny4 = h4 /2. For large values of y4 the approximation is\nreliable as the sum will be dominated by the terms with\npi = 0, \u00b11. Eq.49 introduces two new terms in the action,\none linear in the phase and the other independent of it.\nWe can proceed as before in integrating out the phase\ndegrees of freedom to get a new action which is of the\nform\n\nS = Sv + Sw\n\n\u03bb2 G0w G2p \u2212 Gp + G0p = 0.\n\n(52)\n\nwhere G0p and G0w are the corresponding propagators\nevaluated in the \u0001absence of the linear coupling and\n\u03bb = 4\u03c0 2 JGc2 k/\u03c9 . At the quantum critical point, the\nmost singular contribution for the warps is logarithmic\nin frequency, while the action for the integer fields is not\nsingular. This is again due to the fact that the integer\nfields interact via Colomb Kernel in three dimensions.\n\u0012\nk\n1 X 2\nThus the most singular part of the solution is of the form\n\u0002 \u0003\u22121\n+ 2\nGc 4\u03c0 2 J \u03c1w (k, \u03c9) p (\u2212k, \u2212\u03c9)\nL \u03b2\n\u03c9\n. Substituting in Eqn.51, the effect of\nGp \u2248 1/\u03bb2 G0w\n\u0011\nthe anisotropy is to introduce a term in the action of the\n2\n2\n(50)\n+ |p (k, \u03c9)| + ln (y4 ) |p (k, \u03c9)| .\nform\n\nGiven that the coupling between the integer field p and\nthe phase variable is linear we can follow a self consistent procedure to calculate its effect on the dissipative\nfixed point. In this context it is useful to recall that in\nthe absence of dissipation, the disordered side is characterized by the anisotropy field going to zero, i.e. being marginally irrelevant. Furthermore, in the absence\nof anisotropy the dissipative transition leads to a state\nwhich is characterized by the proliferation of warps. In\nother words, the most singular part of the action is the\ninteraction between warps in time. Since the action for\nthe integer field, p, is quadratic, the cumulant expansion implies that the a new term in the action for warps\nappears of the form\nSe4 =\n\n+\n(a)\n+\n(b)\n\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1 X\n2\n2k\n4\u03c0\nJGc\n\u03c1w (k, \u03c9) \u03c1w (\u2212k, \u2212\u03c9) \u00d7\n2L2 \u03b2\n\u03c9\nhp (k, \u03c9) p (\u2212k, \u2212\u03c9)i .\n(51)\n\nThe correlation is obtained from a self consistent solution\nof the coupled equations shown diagrammatically represented in Fig.6.\nA quadratic equation is obtained for each of the propagators.

Quantum fluctuations of the\norder parameter correspond to flipping between states of\nthe Ashkin-Teller model. From the mapping above of\nthe Ashkin Teller model to an xy model with four fold\nanisotropy, we note that a flip operator is the quenched\nangular momentum operator. For the cuprates, the analogous operator can be shown to correspond to the curl\nof the fermionic current25 . The coupling between the\nfermionic degrees of freedom and the bosonic critical\nmodes is of the form\n\n\f12\nXI.\n\nHcoup \u223c U (r) (\u2207 \u00d7 j)\n\n(54)\n\nwhere U is an operator which flips the state of the Ashkin\nTeller model (analogous to \u2202/\u2202\u03b8 in the continuous limit)\nand j is the fermionic current. Integrating out fermions\nleads to an Ohmic dissipative term in the action for the\norder parameter. The reason is that the current current\ncorrelation is the conductivity which goes as |\u03c9|. Unlike Josephson junction arrays, the origin of dissipation\nin cuprates is the presence of both fermionic and bosonic\ndegrees of freedom in the low energy long-wavelength theory.\n\nX.\n\nCOUPLING TO OTHER DISSIPATIVE\nBATHS\n\nThe form of dissipation considered so far is physically\nmotivated to reproduce a term linear in the gradient of\nthe phase variable in its equation of motion. Furthermore\nit can also be understood as arising from dissipation via\nresistors connecting the islands on which the phase degrees of freedom live. In principle one can also study the\neffect of other forms of dissipation that are allowed by\nsymmetry. In particular, we can introduce a term which\nleads to suppression of density in each grain instead of\nthe phase difference between nearest neighbor grains as\nin eqn.11.\n\nS n = \u03b3n\n\nXZ\n\nd\u03c4 d\u03c4 \u2032\n\ni\n\n(ni (\u03c4 ) \u2212 ni (\u03c4 \u2032 ))\n|\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 |\n\n2\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(55)\n\nTo understand the effect of such a term on the dissipation driven critical point we consider the effect of\nintegrating out frequency shells as before. We find that\nthe coupling constant \u03b3n scales to zero since it has a dimension of \u22122. In other words such a form of dissipation\nis irrelevant near the local quantum critical point, while\nfor a z = 1 critical point such a term is marginal.\nA dissipative mechanism where the external bath directly couples to the phase variable leads to an action of\nthe form\n\nS \u03b8 = \u03b3\u03b8\n\nXZ\ni\n\n2\n\nd\u03c4 d\u03c4 \u2032\n\n(\u03b8i (\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b8i (\u03c4 \u2032 ))\n|\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 |2\n\n.\n\n(56)\n\nThe coupling \u03b3\u03b8 is marginal at the local quantum critical\npoint. A study of the critical properties showed the existence of a line of fixed points controlling the transition\nfrom the superconducting to the insulating state45 , but\nthe approximation made were called into question46 . A\nweak coupling study of the model has been reported51\nand a strong coupling analysis will be the subject of future investigation\n\nRELATIONSHIP TO OTHER MODELS\n\nWith the identification of the correct degrees of freedom we have been able to access the dissipation driven\ncritical point that has been previously shown to exist\nwithin a perturbative analysis. Furthermore, fourfold\nanisotropy does not alter the local criticality obtained\nat this quantum critical point. Thus the dissipative xy\nmodel defines a new universality class. Classical models\nwhich undergo a Gaussian phase transition from an ordered to a disordered phase will belong to this universality class provided their quantum generalization include\nOhmic dissipation. In this context we can look at the\nphysics of six and eight vertex models.\nThe phase diagram of the six vertex model has two\nordered phases, the orbital ferromagnet and the orbital\nantiferromagnet, and a power law phase. The high temperature phase is the power law phase and at low temperatures undergoes a transition to one of the two ordered\nphases. It is known that there exists an essential singularity at the phase transition and the physics is similar to\nthe xy model except that is inverted. The high temperature phase is power law correlated while the low temperature phase has finite correlations47. Unlike the dissipative XY model considered here, the inverted character\nof the phase transition, while allowing for a phase transition without a singularity in specific heat48 , is unlikely to\nbelong to the universality class of local criticality. However, the low temperature physics of this model including\nquantum generalization allowing for sources and sink is\nyet to be analyzed. The classical eight vertex model on\nthe other hand has in its parameter space a high temperature disordered phase which can undergo a KT transition to an ordered phase20 . Such models also share the\nfeature that the specific heat is nonsingular at the phase\ntransition. Quantum generalization of this model with\ndissipation have not been studied. In particular it is not\nclear which operators in the classical theory are equivalent to the warps defined in the continuum. A detailed\nanalysis of the conditions for classical eight vertex models to exhibit local criticality is beyond the scope of this\npaper.\nLocal quantum criticality closely related to the form\nproposed for the Cuprates24 and derived here has also\nbeen used to fit the spectral function near the quantumcritical point of a heavy-fermion26 measured by neutron\nscattering. Some theoretical calculations27 emphasizing\nthe deconstruction of the single impurity Kondo effect\nnear the quantum critical point49 have been performed.\nA general point based on the present work appears worth\nmaking: Local quantum criticality requires showing that\nnear the quantum-critical point, there must be variables\nin terms of which the action for low energies is separable\nexactly into orthogonal parts which interact only in space\nwithout retardation in time, and those which are power\nlaw in time but interact only locally in space. It appears to us that only dissipation driven quantum critical\npoints can have this property. At this point, it does not\n\n\f13\nappear clear to us in terms of which variables, the general Action of the heavy fermion problem with dissipation, local Kondo interactions, interaction between local\nmoments, magnetic order with attendant deconstruction\nof the Kondo effect, etc., may be cast into the simple\nstructure due to which we have been able to solve the\nproblems addressed in this paper.\nXII.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper we have provided a detailed analysis of\nthe dissipation driven phase transition in the quantum 2d\nxy model. There exists a critical point in the phase diagram where the correlation are shown to be local in space\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nV.

This is a new paradigm in critical phenomena which does not appear in the universality\nclasses of classical dynamical critical phenomena50 . The\nquantum disordering due to the proliferation of a new\nof class of topological defects, the warps, which interact logarithmically in time but local in space allows such\ncriticality. We have discussed that the results here are\nonly asymptotically true and only valid for certain forms\nof dissipation. A verification of the results by quantum\nmonte-carlo calculations is highly desirable.\nA principal outcome of the paper is to derive the phenomenological assumptions of the marginal fermi-liquid\ntheory with which the critical properties of the Cuprates\nin the anomalous metallic regime have been understood.\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n30\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n34\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n42\n\n43\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n47\n48\n49\n\narXiv.org/cond-mat/0807.3741.\nA.
