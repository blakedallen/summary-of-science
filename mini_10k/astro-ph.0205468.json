It is easier to detect than individual clusters in the field, is insensitive to observational selection effects and does not require a calibration between cluster mass and flux,\nreducing the systematic errors which dominate the cluster-counting constraints. It receives\na dominant contribution from virialized cluster region between 20 \u2212 40% of the virial radius and is thus relatively insensitive to the poorly known gas physics in the cluster centre,\nsuch as cooling or (pre)heating. In this paper we derive a refined analytic prediction for the\nSZ angular power spectrum using the universal gas-density and temperature profile and the\ndark-matter halo mass function. The predicted power spectrum has no free parameters and\nfits all of the published hydrodynamic simulation results to better than a factor of two for\n2000 < l < 10000. We find that the angular power spectrum Cl scales as Cl \u221d \u03c387 (\u03a9b h)2\nand is almost independent of all of the other cosmological parameters. This differs from the\nlocal cluster abundance studies, which give a relation between \u03c38 and \u03a9m . We also compute the covariance matrix of Cl using the halo model and find a good agreement relative to\nthe simulations. We argue that the best constraint from the SZ power spectrum comes from\nl \u223c 3000, where the sampling variance is sufficiently small and the spectrum is dominated by\nmassive clusters above 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 for which cooling, heating and details of star formation\nare not very important. We estimate how well we can determine \u03c38 (\u03a9b h)2/7 with samplingvariance-limited observations and find that for a several-square-degree survey with arcminute\nresolution one should be able to determine \u03c38 to within a few percent, with the remaining\nuncertainty dominated by theoretical modeling. If the recent excess of the CMB power on\nsmall scales reported by CBI and BIMA experiments is due to the SZ effect, then we find\n\u03c38 (\u03a9b h/0.035)0.29 = 1.04 \u00b1 0.12 at 95% confidence level (statistical) and with a residual\n10% systematic (theoretical) uncertainty.\nKey words: cosmology: theory - cosmic microwave background - dark matter - galaxies:\nhaloes - galaxies: clusters: general - cosmological parameters\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nAbundance of dark-matter halos and its redshift evolution have\nbeen recognized as an important cosmological test. For example,\nthe local abundance of X-ray clusters can be used to constrain\na combination of the matter-fluctuation amplitude and the matter\ndensity of the universe (e.g., White, Efstathiou, & Frenk 1993;\nViana & Liddle 1996; Eke, Cole, & Frenk 1996; Kitayama & Suto\n1997). Higher-redshift clusters can be used to break this degeneracy\n(e.g., Bahcall & Fan 1998), as well as constrain other cosmological\nparameters (Haiman, Mohr, & Holder 2001).\n\n\u22c6 E-mail: komatsu@astro.princeton.edu\n\u2020 E-mail: useljak@princeton.edu\n\nThere are two major uncertainties in such analysis. One is the\nsample itself, which has to be carefully constructed to avoid any\npossible selection biases that can affect the final constraint. The\nother is the relation between observable quantities (e.g., X-ray temperature or flux) and the halo mass, which is related to the theoretical models. The latter uncertainty is particularly important as\na small error in this relation can result in a significant effect on\nthe final results. For example, the X-ray flux scales as gas-density\nsquared and is dominated by the central regions, where complicated\nphysical processes are taking place. This means that the relation between flux or flux-weighted temperature and the halo mass is not\neasily obtained from ab-initio numerical simulations, and one must\nresort to more empirical calibrations instead.\nThe Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich (SZ) effect has some advantages\n\n\f2\n\nE. Komatsu & U. Seljak\n\nover X-ray in this respect. The SZ effect is caused by the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) photons scattering off hot electrons\nin the intracluster medium, and the SZ flux is proportional to the\nprojected electron-gas pressure, which is proportional to a product\nof electron number density and temperature along the line of sight.\nRelative to X-ray emission this has a larger contribution from the\nouter parts of the cluster, where the missing physics such as gas\npreheating or cooling in numerical simulations is less significant.\nHowever, the SZ effect is very difficult to measure and currently only detections of already-known clusters exist (Birkinshaw\n1999). It is likely that the first SZ detection in a random direction\nwill not be that of a specific cluster, but of a field correlation function, or the angular power spectrum Cl , with several low signal-tonoise clusters contributing to the signal. Even if individual clusters\nare too faint to be detected with high statistical significance, the\ncombined effect in Cl can be statistically significant. There have\nbeen several observational efforts in measuring the small-scale fluctuations, and upper-limits have been obtained by ATCA (Subrahmanyan et al. 1998), BIMA (Holzapfel et al. 2000; Dawson et al.\n2001), SUZIE (Church et al. 1997; Ganga et al. 1997), and VLA\n(Partridge et al. 1997). Recently, CBI and BIMA experiments have\nreported statistically significant detections of the small-scale fluctuations at the level of 15 \u2212 20 \u03bcK on arcminutes angular scales\n(Mason et al. 2002; Dawson et al. 2002), and their results may already be providing the first detection of the SZ fluctuations (Bond\net al. 2002).\nThere are other advantages of using power spectrum in addition to the higher statistical significance in a noisy map. One is\nthat selection effects are less important than in a cluster survey, for\nwhich flux, surface brightness, and other selection criteria have to\nbe carefully examined to avoid any biases. The other is that we do\nnot have to measure the mass of individual haloes. As discussed\nabove this is a dominant source of uncertainty in the local-massfunction determination from X-ray clusters and lack of a good calibration can lead to a 30% error on \u03c38 . Even if mass were determined from SZ flux, for which the central regions are less important, one would still need to include effects such as substructure,\nprojections, ellipticity etc. As we argue in this paper using the SZ\npower spectrum instead of the number-count analysis is less sensitive to selection biases and can still give statistically significant\nresults. It is true that the power spectrum does not use all of the\ninformation available, specially if one obtains the information on\ncluster redshifts. However, the SZ power spectrum provides quite\npowerful constraints on cosmological parameters already by itself\nand the small increase in statistical errors is more than compensated by the decrease in the systematic uncertainties. Thus initial\nexperimental efforts should focus on the power spectrum as a more\nreliable method to determine the cosmological parameters.\nThere are of course other effects that contribute to fluctuations\nin this range of wavelengths. The SZ effect is the dominant contribution for l > 2000 \u2212 4000, depending on its amplitude. The\nprimary CMB dominates on the larger scales. Although the primary CMB confuses the SZ effect, we can reduce or eliminate it by\nobserving at 217 GHz at which the SZ effect vanishes. Many of the\ncurrent generation CMB experiments (such as CBI) operate at low\nfrequencies, where the frequency dependence of CMB and the SZ\neffect is similar, and the two cannot be distinguished very well on\nthis basis. Galactic emission (synchrotron, dust, or free-free) does\nnot have much power on the small angular scales, and has a different frequency dependence from CMB. They are not likely to be\na major source of contamination. We ignore the kinetic SZ effect,\n\nas it is at least an order of magnitude smaller in power than the\nthermal SZ effect.\nPoint sources have a lot of small-scale power and are potentially more problematic contaminant. While we can easily identify\nbright (more than several-\u03c3) point sources, we cannot identify the\nfainter ones, which will contaminate the SZ effect. This is particularly problematic for narrow frequency coverage experiments such\nas CBI, as we cannot use different frequency dependence of the\npoint sources to separate the two components. We can still try to\nuse opposite signatures between SZ and point sources as a way to\ndistinguish them; the SZ effect is negative in flux at low frequencies, while point sources are positive. This results in a skewed onepoint-distribution function. We can also use the difference in the\nshape of the correlation function, since more extended correlation\nin the SZ effect differs from the point sources. The SZ power spectrum scales roughly as l\u22122 while that of the point sources is constant, so the two can be distinguished. In practice noise and beam\nsmoothing may make this analysis more complicated.\nWithin a few years, several experiments will likely measure\nthe SZ effect with an arcminute angular resolution and the effective area of several square degrees. This has motivated us to revisit\nthe predictions for the SZ angular power spectrum. Many analytic\ncalculations exist in the literature (Cole & Kaiser 1988; Makino &\nSuto 1993; Atrio-Barandela & M\u00fccket 1999; Komatsu & Kitayama\n1999; Cooray 2000; Molnar & Birkinshaw 2000; Holder & Carlstrom 2001; Zhang & Pen 2001), as well as many hydrodynamicsimulation results (Scaramella, Cen, & Ostriker 1993; Persi et al.\n1995; Refregier et al. 2000; Seljak, Burwell, & Pen 2001; da Silva\net al. 2000; da Silva et al. 2001a; da Silva et al. 2001b; Springel,\nWhite, & Hernquist 2001; Refregier & Teyssier 2000; Zhang, Pen,\n& Wang 2002). The comparison between different simulations is\ndifficult, as the parameters used differ, and the resulting power\nspectrum is extremely sensitive to the chosen parameters. Since\nmassive clusters are at the tail of the dark-matter mass function,\nthe r.m.s. mass fluctuations within a 8 h\u22121 Mpc sphere, \u03c38 , is the\nmost important parameter among the cosmological parameters. Komatsu & Kitayama (1999) have shown that the matter density of the\nuniverse is less important than \u03c38 .\nRefregier et al. (2000) and Refregier & Teyssier (2000) have\nattempted to compare analytic predictions based upon the so-called\n\"halo approach\" (section 2) with their simulated power spectrum,\nfinding a good agreement. This agreement is, however, partially\nbuilt into their model; in their approach, the parameters such as upper and lower mass cut-off are chosen to agree with the simulations.\nAnother free parameter used in the analytic modeling that cannot\nbe obtained from these models is the mass\u2013temperature normalization. Although a virial relation has often been used in this context,\nthe overall amplitude is treated as a free parameter, and cannot be\njustified without a more detailed model. In this paper we develop a\nmore refined analytic model and show that it reproduces the simulation results without any free parameters, at least at the level of the\nsimulations disagreeing among themselves.\nThe main ingredients into the halo model are the dark-matterhalo mass function, the gas-density and the gas-temperature profiles. For the latter, we use an analytic gas and temperature profile\nmodel developed in our previous paper (Komatsu & Seljak 2001).\nWe have shown that it reproduces well the simulation results in the\nouter parts of the cluster which are relevant for the SZ effect. This\nmodel fixes the normalization between mass and temperature by\nrequiring that the gas and the dark-matter profiles agree with each\nother outside the gas core. Hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Frenk\net al. 1999) have shown that this assumption holds accurately. As a\n\n\fThe Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich angular power spectrum\nresult of this assumption and hydrostatic equilibrium the gas temperature declines in the outer parts of the cluster, which is also seen\nin the simulations (although it remains controversial in X-ray observations due to the faint levels of X-ray emission in the outer parts of\nthe cluster). This model therefore reproduces the main features of\nthe hydrodynamic simulations and can be viewed as the gas analog\nof the often-used NFW profile (Navarro, Frenk, & White 1997) for\ndark matter, at least outside the gas core where additional physics\nmay play a role.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In \u00a7 2 we outline the\n\"halo approach\" to calculating the SZ angular power spectrum. In\n\u00a7 3 we derive the universal gas-density, gas-temperature, and gaspressure profiles following the prescription described by Komatsu\n& Seljak (2001). In \u00a7 4 we predict the spectrum and compare it\nto the hydrodynamic simulations. We then investigate the dependence of the spectrum on various cosmological parameters. We also\nstudy the mass and redshift distribution of the spectrum. In \u00a7 5 we\ncompute the covariance matrix of Cl by taking into account nonGaussianity of the SZ fluctuations and compare these to the hydrodynamic simulations. In \u00a7 6 we show how well we can determine \u03c38\nwith realistic SZ observations using a likelihood analysis. We put\nconstraints on a \u03a9m \u2212\u03c38 plane using the recent CBI and BIMA data\nof the small-scale CMB fluctuations at l \u223c 2000 \u2212 6000 (Mason\net al. 2002; Dawson et al. 2002). In \u00a7 7 we quantify the theoretical\nuncertainty in our predictions. Finally, we summarize our results in\n\u00a7 8. The fiducial cosmological model in this paper is \u03a9m = 0.37,\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.63, \u03a9b = 0.05, h = 0.7, w = \u22121.0, n = 1.0, and\n\u03c38 = 1.0.\n\n2 HALO APPROACH TO THE SZ ANGULAR POWER\nSPECTRUM\nTo compute the angular power spectrum of the SZ effect we use the\nhalo formalism (Cole & Kaiser 1988; Makino & Suto 1993; AtrioBarandela & M\u00fccket 1999; Komatsu & Kitayama 1999; Cooray\n2000; Molnar & Birkinshaw 2000; Holder & Carlstrom 2001). For\nthe angular scales of interest here, l > 300, the one-halo Poisson term dominates Cl even after the subtraction of local massive\nhaloes (Komatsu & Kitayama 1999). We thus neglect the halo-halo\ncorrelation term throughout the paper.\nThe expression for Cl is given by\nCl =\n\ng\u03bd2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nzmax\n\ndV\ndz\ndz\n\nZ\n\nMmax\n\nMmin\n\ndn(M, z)\n|\u1ef9l (M, z)|2 ,\ndM\ndM\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g\u03bd is the spectral function of the SZ effect (\u22122 in the\nRayleigh\u2013Jeans limit) (Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1980), V (z) the comoving volume of the universe at z per steradian, dn(M, z)/dM\nthe comoving dark-matter-halo mass function, and \u1ef9l (M, z) the 2D\nFourier transform of the projected Compton y-parameter. The virial\nmass M used here and its mass function are described in more detail in section 2.1.\nFor the upper integration boundary of redshift it suffices to\ntake zmax = 10 (figure 5). For the mass integration boundaries,\nMmin and Mmax , we find that Mmin = 5 \u00d7 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 and\nMmax = 5 \u00d7 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 suffice to get the integral to converge\non all angular scales, whereas Mmin = 5 \u00d7 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 is sufficient for l < 104 (figure 6). Since the integrals converge the results\nare not subject to the specific choice of integration boundaries.\nThe 2D Fourier transform of the projected Compton yparameter, \u1ef9l = \u1ef9l (M, z), is given by\n\n\u1ef9l =\n\n4\u03c0rs\nls2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndxx2 y3D (x)\n\n0\n\nsin(lx/ls )\n,\nlx/ls\n\n3\n(2)\n\nwhere y3D (x) is the 3D radial profile of the Compton y-parameter\n(equation 7 in section 3). Note that y3D (x) has a dimension of\n(length)\u22121 , while \u1ef9l is dimensionless. In equation (2) we have\nused x as a scaled, non-dimensional radius,\nx \u2261 r/rs ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere rs = rs (M, z) is a scale radius which characterizes the 3D\nradial profile and the corresponding angular wave number is\nls \u2261 dA /rs .\n\n(4)\n\nHere dA = dA (z) is the proper angular-diameter distance. The\nprojection of the 3D profile onto the sky in equation (2) was done\nwithin the Limber's approximation. In section 3, we derive y3D (x)\nusing the universal gas and temperature profile.\n\n2.1 Dark-matter halo mass function\nFor the dark-matter halo mass function dn(M, z)/dM in equation (1) we use the universal mass function (Jenkins et al. 2001),\nwhich was derived from N -body simulations. We should be careful about the definition of \"mass\" when using the mass function\nderived from N -body simulations (e.g., White 2001; Seljak 2001;\nHu & Kravtsov 2002). The mass of haloes in the simulations is\nusually not the virial mass M as defined in our analytic formulation (equation 1). Instead, the simulations usually use either the\nfriend-of-friend (FOF) mass or the spherical overdensity (SO) mass\nto define the haloes. We use here the SO mass, as the FOF mass is\ndifficult to interpret in the context of analytic formulation.\nWe define the SO mass, M\u03b4 , as the mass within the spherical region whose density is \u03b4 times the critical density of the universe at z \u03c1c (z) (note that sometimes one uses instead the mass\nwithin the spherical region whose density is \u03b4\u0303 times the mean mass\ndensity of the universe at z, \u03c1m (z) = \u03a9m (z)\u03c1c (z); the two are\nrelated through \u03b4 = \u03a9m (z)\u03b4\u0303). Since N -body simulations give\ndn(M\u03b4 , z)/dM\u03b4 , we need to convert it into dn(M, z)/dM . We\ndo this by calculating\ndn(M, z)\ndM\u03b4 dn(M\u03b4 , z)\n=\n.\ndM\ndM\ndM\u03b4\n\n(5)\n\nFor a given virial mass, M , we calculate M\u03b4 with equation (14)\nof Komatsu & Seljak (2001), and also evaluate dM\u03b4 /dM numerically.\nWe use equation (B3) of Jenkins et al. (2001), which explicitly\nuses \u03b4 = 180\u03a9m (z) (mass density of haloes is 180 times the mean\nmass density of the universe at z),\ndn(M\u03b4 , z)\ndM\u03b4\n\n=\n\n\u03a9m (0)\n\n\u03c1c (0) d ln \u03c3 \u22121\nM\u03b4 dM\u03b4\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00d70.301 exp \u2212 ln \u03c3 \u22121 + 0.64\n\n3.82\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3 = \u03c3(M\u03b4 , z) is the linear, r.m.s. mass fluctuations at a\ngiven redshift z within the top-hat filter. To compute \u03c3 we use the\nBBKS transfer function (Bardeen et al. 1986) with the baryonic\ncorrection made by Sugiyama (1995). The present-day critical density of the universe is \u03c1c (0) = 2.775 \u00d7 1011 h2 M\u2299 Mpc\u22123 . Note\nthat we have defined the mass function as the comoving number\ndensity.\nWhile the functional formula for the mass function in equation (6) was tested for just one cosmological model (\u03c4 CDM model)\n\n\f4\n\nE. Komatsu & U. Seljak\n\nby Jenkins et al. (2001), it is essentially a non-smoothed version of\ntheir universal mass function valid for a broad range of models. Hu\n& Kravtsov (2002) have shown that the formula agrees with their\nsimulated mass function as well which uses a different cosmological model. In addition, Evrard et al. (2002) have shown that their\nmass function for the SO mass haloes with \u03b4 = 200 agrees with the\nJenkins et al.'s formula, once taking into account the mass definition properly (see also related discussion in Seljak 2001 and Hu &\nKravtsov 2002). There is thus increasing evidence for the accuracy\nof Jenkins et al.'s mass function.\n\n3 GAS-PRESSURE PROFILE OF HALOES\n3.1 Introduction\nThe 3D Compton y-parameter profile, y3D (x), is given by a thermal gas-pressure profile, Pgas (x), through\ny3D (x)\n\n\u2261\n\n\u03c3T\n\u03c3T\nPe (x) =\nme c2\nme c2\n\n=\n\n1.04 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n2 + 2X\nPgas (x)\n3 + 5X\n\u0014\n\u0015\nPgas (x)\nMpc\u22121\n,\n50 eV cm\u22123\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Pe (x) is an electron-pressure profile, X = 0.76 the primordial hydrogen abundance, \u03c3T the Thomson cross section, me the\nelectron mass, and c the speed of light.\nWe may write Pgas (x) with a gas-density profile, \u03c1gas (x), and\na gas-temperature profile, Tgas (x), as\nPgas (x)\n\n=\n=\n\n3 + 5X \u03c1gas (x)\nkB Tgas (x)\n4\nmp\n\u22123\n55.0\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014 eV cm\nkB Tgas (x)\n\u03c1gas (x)\n,\n\u00d7\n1014 M\u2299 Mpc\u22123\n8 keV\n\n(8)\n\nwhere mp is the proton mass, and kB the Boltzmann constant.\nThe aim of this section is to derive Pgas (x) following Komatsu\n& Seljak (2001). Pressure profile was one of the uncertainties in\nthe previous work on the SZ power spectrum: most of the previous\nwork uses a spherical-isothermal \u03b2 model as a gas-density profile,\nwith \u03b2 fixed at 2/3 for simplicity (Makino & Suto 1993; AtrioBarandela & M\u00fccket 1999; Komatsu & Kitayama 1999; Molnar &\nBirkinshaw 2000; Holder & Carlstrom 2001); Cooray (2000) used\nan isothermal gas-density profile as predicted by Makino, Sasaki,\n& Suto (1998), which uses hydrostatic equilibrium between gas\npressure and dark-matter potential, and is close to the \u03b2 profile.\nThe \u03b2 profile does not, however, reproduce the simulation results\nin the outer parts of the haloes. The outer slope of the \u03b2 model\nwith \u03b2 = 2/3 scales as r \u22122 , being significantly shallower than the\ngas profile in simulations which, as we have argued, is similar to\nthe dark-matter profile and asymptotically scales as r \u22123 . Since the\nSZ effect is sensitive to the outer parts of haloes, this can cause a\nsignificant error in the predictions.\nThere is a related uncertainty caused by the shallow (r \u22122 ) profile: one has to cut out the extension of gas in haloes at an arbitrary\nradius, otherwise one predicts too much power on large angular\nscales. We find that the previous predictions are unstable against\nthis cut-off radius. This radius, which is a free parameter, has been\nassumed to be the virial radius; however, for isothermal gas assumed in the previous work this is ad hoc, as neither temperature\nnor density profile shows the abrupt cut-off at the virial radius in\nhydrodynamic simulations (Bryan & Norman 1998; Eke, Navarro,\n& Frenk 1998; Frenk et al. 1999). Instead, both the temperature\n\nand the density decrease smoothly across the virial radius, and it is\nonly at 2 \u2212 3 times the virial radius that there seems to be an abrupt\ndecrease of the temperature to the IGM value, the so-called shock\nradius (Bryan & Norman 1998).\nOnce the decline in profiles relative to the \u03b2 model is included,\nthe contribution from the outer parts of haloes to the SZ power\nspectrum converges well within the shock radius, and is thus independent of the outer cut-off of the profile. This is because requiring\nthat the gas-density profile traces the dark-matter-density profile\nleads to \u03c1gas \u221d r \u22123 in the outer parts of the haloes. This by itself\nwould give a logarithmically divergent gas-mass profile; however,\nsince the temperature is also declining with radius, the resulting\npressure profile is convergent. Hydrostatic equilibrium and the gas\ndensity tracing the dark-matter density make the gas temperature\ndecrease with radius.\n3.2 Universal dark-matter-density profile\nThe universal NFW dark-matter-density profile (Navarro, Frenk, &\nWhite 1997) is\n\u03c1s\n\u03c1dm (x) =\n,\n(9)\nx(1 + x)2\nwhere x \u2261 r/rs , rs a scale radius, and \u03c1s a scale density. While the\nexact shape in the inner parts is still uncertain (Moore et al. 1998;\nJing & Suto 2000; Klypin et al. 2001), it does not affect the SZ\neffect, given the scales of interest here.\nTo specify the NFW profile, we need to specify a scale radius,\nrs , as a function of mass and redshift. It is customary to specify the\nconcentration parameter c instead of rs ,\nc(M, z) \u2261\n\nrvir (M, z)\n10\n\u2248\nrs (M, z)\n1+z\n\n\u0014\n\nM\nM\u2217 (0)\n\n\u0015\u22120.2\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere rvir (M, z) is the virial radius of haloes, and the last expression follows from Seljak (2000) with redshift evolution found by\nBullock et al. (2001). The \"non-linear mass\" at z = 0, M\u2217 (0), is a\nsolution to \u03c3(M ) = \u03b4c , where \u03c3(M ) is the present-day r.m.s. mass\nfluctuations within the top-hat filter, M the virial mass, and \u03b4c the\nthreshold overdensity of spherical collapse at z = 0 (Lacey & Cole\n1993; Nakamura & Suto 1997). We calculate the virial radius using\nthe spherical collapse model,\nrvir (M, z) \u2261\n\n\u0014\n\nM\n(4\u03c0/3)\u2206c (z)\u03c1c (z)\n\n\u00151/3\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u2206c (z) is a spherical overdensity of the virialized halo within\nrvir at z, in units of the critical density of the universe at z (Lacey\n& Cole 1993; Nakamura & Suto 1997).\nThe exact form of c(M, z), equation (10), is somewhat uncertain. There are various fitting formulae in the literature (Navarro,\nFrenk, & White 1997; Eke, Navarro, & Steinmetz 2001; Bullock\net al. 2001; Seljak 2000; Cooray, Hu, & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2000). In\nsection 4 we study the effect of different concentration parameters\non our predictions, in addition to using our fiducial concentration\nparameter dependence in equation (10). We find that the difference\nin concentration parameters does not affect our predictions, largely\nbecause the SZ effect is not sensitive to the central parts of haloes,\nwhere the profile shape makes most difference.\n3.3 Universal gas-pressure profile\nTo derive a gas-pressure profile Pgas (x) we make three assumptions: (1) hydrostatic equilibrium between gas pressure and dark-\n\n\fThe Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich angular power spectrum\nmatter potential due to the universal dark-matter density profile,\n(2) gas density tracing the universal dark-matter density in the outer\nparts of haloes, and (3) a constant polytropic equation of state for\ngas, Pgas \u221d \u03c1\u03b3gas . The assumption (3) is obviously just an approximation and can be justified only to the extent that it suffices to\nexplain the observations or simulations. There is evidence for this\nassumption to fail within inner 5% of the virial radius, where X-ray\nobservations indicate that temperature increases with radius (Allen,\nSchmidt, & Fabian 2001). Outside the core region, nevertheless, the\nconstant polytropic index seems to suffice, at least in comparison\nto the simulations.\nFrom these three assumptions one can obtain universal gasdensity, gas-temperature, and gas-pressure profiles as\n\u03c1gas (x) = \u03c1gas (0)ygas (x),\nTgas (x) =\n\n(12)\n\n\u03b3\u22121\nTgas (0)ygas\n(x),\n\n(13)\n\n\u03b3\nPgas (0)ygas\n(x).\n\n(14)\n\nSolving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation with the ansatz above,\nwe find that the non-dimensional gas-density profile, ygas (x), has\nan analytic solution, and is given by (Komatsu & Seljak 2001)\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n1\u2212B 1\u2212\n\nln(1 + x)\nx\n\n\u0015\u001b1/(\u03b3\u22121)\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the coefficient B is\nB \u2261 3\u03b7 \u22121 (0)\n\n\u03b3\u22121\n\u03b3\n\n\u0014\n\nln(1 + c)\n1\n\u2212\nc\n1+c\n\n\u0015\u22121\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nIn appendix, we give exact formulae for the polytropic index, \u03b3,\nand the mass\u2013temperature normalization factor at the centre, \u03b7(0).\nHere we provide instead useful fitting formulae:\n\u22122\n\n\u03b3 = 1.137 + 8.94 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22123\n\nln(c/5) \u2212 3.68 \u00d7 10\n\n(c \u2212 5),\n\n(17)\n\nand\n\u03b7(0) = 2.235 + 0.202(c \u2212 5) \u2212 1.16 \u00d7 10\u22123 (c \u2212 5)2 .\n\n(18)\n\nThese fitting formulae are valid for 1 < c < 25. Since \u03b3 > 1 and\nthe density decreases with radius, the temperature also decreases\nwith radius.\nFrom \u03b7(0), we can determine the central temperature,\nTgas (0), as\nTgas (0)\n\n\u03c1gas (c)\n\n=\n=\n\n4\nGmp M\n3 + 5X 3rvir\n\u0015\n\u0014\nM/(1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 )\n.\n8.80 keV \u03b7(0)\nrvir /(1 h\u22121 Mpc)\n\u03b7(0)\n\n(19)\n\nThe central gas density, \u03c1gas (0), is determined by equation (21)\nbelow. We then compute the central gas pressure, Pgas (0), by substituting \u03c1gas (0) and Tgas (0) into equation (8). This completely\nspecifies the gas-density, the gas-temperature, and the gas-pressure\nprofiles of haloes and their normalizations.\nWe determine the amount of gas in haloes by requiring that the\ngas density in the outer parts of haloes is \u03a9b /\u03a9m times the darkmatter density. Unlike the \u03b2 profile this is self-consistent, as our\ngas-density profile agrees with the dark-matter profile outside the\ngas core. The virial radius thus has no special importance, and the\nmatching can be performed over a broad range of radii without affecting the results. We should reduce the gas fraction by the amount\nthat has been converted to stars, which is of order 10\u221220% for massive clusters of interest here (Fukugita, Hogan, & Peebles 1998).\n\n\u03a9b\n\u03c1dm (c)\n\u03a9m\n\n=\n\n\u03c1gas (0)ygas (c) =\n\n=\n\nc\nc2\n\u03a9b M\nln(1 + c) \u2212\n3\n\u03a9m 4\u03c0rvir (1 + c)2\n1+c\n\nh\n\ni\u22121\n\n.

We then study the sensitivity of Cl to various\ncosmological parameters. We also study mass and redshift distribution of Cl , finding that the power spectrum primarily probes massive haloes in a moderate redshift universe.\n\n4.1 Comparison with hydrodynamic simulations\nWe begin by comparing our predictions for Cl with six hydrodynamic simulations (four independent codes), listed in table 1. Figure 1 compares our analytic predictions with the simulated power\nspectra.\nThe predictions generally agree with the simulations within a\nfactor of two. We find the best agreement for the nominally highestresolution (5123 ) simulation run by Zhang, Pen, & Wang (2002)\nusing mesh-based MMH code (bottom-left panel of figure 1). The\nsame code, but for different cosmological parameters and at lower\n(2563 ) resolution, agrees well below l < 10000, but lacks power\nabove that (Seljak, Burwell, & Pen 2001) (top-left panel). Note that\nthe number of realizations for this simulation was small, which explains lack of power at low l compared to even lower (1283 ) resolution used by Refregier et al. (2000) for the same code and the\nsame cosmological parameters.\nFor the 2563 simulation we have created more 2-d maps, covering the effective area of 1000 square degrees. We find that with\nmore realizations Cl at low l increases, becoming into better agreement with Refregier et al. (2000). This indicates that the sampling\nvariance is very large on large scales, but is significantly reduced\nabove l \u223c 2000 \u2212 3000. With more realizations, one typically\nincreases power on large scales, which explains some of the differences among different simulations (they differ in the effective\nsimulated area significantly; see table 1). Even so most of the simulations are too small to include sufficient number of very massive\nhalos and for these multiple maps from a single simulation do not\nreduce the sampling variance. This can explain why the simulations\nare still below the analytic model at low l. At least for MMH code,\nwe find that the numerical resolution seems to be important at high\n\n\f6\n\nE. Komatsu & U. Seljak\n\nFigure 1. Comparison between the predicted SZ angular power spectra\n(solid) and the simulations (dashed; see table 1 for the meaning of the labels\nshown in each panel, and for the cosmological parameters used). The dotted\nlines indicate r.m.s. errors of the simulated power spectra. The bottom-right\npanel scales all the power spectra by \u03c387 (\u03a9b h)2 . The agreement between\nthe scaled power spectra indicates that this combination of cosmological\nparameters controls the amplitude of Cl .\n\nl, and it causes some of the discrepancy between our model and the\nMMH simulations.\nThe comparison with one of the two SPH simulations, da\nSilva et al. (2001b) using HYDRA code, shows a good agreement in shape, while the GADGET code (Springel, White, &\nHernquist 2001) seems to predict more small-scale power above\nl \u223c 5000 compared to our predictions. We find that the shape of\nCl of Springel, White, & Hernquist (2001) is similar to Refregier\n& Teyssier (2000), which uses a mesh-based hydrodynamic code,\nRAMSES, so the disagreement is unlikely to be due to simply SPH\nversus mesh-based codes. We note that the SPH simulation presented in Bond et al. (2002) also agrees in shape with Springel,\nWhite, & Hernquist (2001).\nA possible explanation for the discrepancy is that some simulations such as MMH have not yet converged for very high l, while\nat low l sampling variance seems to be the most likely explanation. The discrepancy between our analytic model and GADGET\nand RAMSES could be caused by failure of our model at high l:\nclusters at higher redshift are less regular with more merging and\nsubstructure, which boosts Cl at high l. One way to account for this\nin analytic model would be to include subhalos within halos, but to\nproperly calibrate this one would need to use hydrodynamic simulations. Here we argue that around l \u223c 3000 the theoretical model\nand the simulations seem to agree rather well, certainly within a\nfactor of two or better. Any remaining discrepancy at low l could\nbe due to insufficient sampling in simulations. Although a factor\nof two may sound like a large uncertainty in the Cl prediction, it\ntranslates into a rather small uncertainty in \u03c38 , as discussed below.\n\nFigure 2. Dependence of the SZ angular power spectrum on \u03c38 . From top\nto bottom, the lines indicate \u03c38 = 1.2, 1.1, 1.05, 1.0, 0.95, 0.9, and 0.8, as\nshown in the figure.\n\n4.2 Dependence on cosmological parameters\nIn previous work it has been argued that the SZ power spectrum\nis very sensitive to \u03c38 (Komatsu & Kitayama 1999; Seljak, Burwell, & Pen 2001; Zhang & Pen 2001; Zhang, Pen, & Wang 2002).\nFigure 2 shows this dependence within the analytic model. For example, a 40% change in \u03c38 causes one order of magnitude change\nin Cl , while a 10% change in \u03c38 causes a factor of two change. We\nfind that Cl \u221d \u03c387 provides a good description of this scaling (see\nalso the bottom-right panel of figure 1). The strong dependence of\nCl on \u03c38 indicates that even if the numerical simulations are uncertain at the level of a factor of two, this translates into less than 10%\nsystematic uncertainty in \u03c38 .\nThis property of the SZ power spectrum should be compared\nwith the current uncertainty in \u03c38 from the local cluster abundance\nstudies, for which the systematic uncertainty is larger than 10%\nbecause of the uncertainty in the mass\u2013temperature relation (e.g.,\nPierpaoli, Scott, & White 2001; Seljak 2001; Viana, Nichol, & Liddle 2002). Weak lensing (e.g., Van Waerbeke et al. 2002) and direct mass\u2013temperature calibration may soon provide a more reliable method to determine \u03c38 \u03a90.5\nm combination. On the other hand,\nwe show below that Cl is not sensitive to \u03a9m in the range of current\ninterest. This property can break the degeneracy between the two\nparameters.\nFigure 3 shows dependence of Cl on \u03a9m assuming a flat universe, i.e., \u03a9\u039b = 1 \u2212 \u03a9m . While Cl \u221d \u03a9m for \u03a9m > 0.4, we find\nthat it is almost independent of \u03a9m for 0.15 < \u03a9m < 0.4. This\nis because the comoving volume of the universe increases rapidly\nwith \u03a9m decreasing in this region, canceling out the effect of \u03a9m\non the dark-matter mass function. As this range of \u03a9m is favored\nby current observations, Cl is practically independent of \u03a9m .\nFigure 4 shows dependence of Cl on equation of state w, \u03a9b ,\nh, and n. While varying \u03a9b or h, we have fixed \u03a9b h at a fiducial\nvalue, 0.035, since we know that Cl scales as (\u03a9b h)2 .

We find that Cl\ndepends upon w, \u03a9b , h, or n very weakly compared to \u03c38 (compare\nfigure 4 with figure 2). The only exception is if w > \u22122/3, which\nis however not favored by current observations (Bean & Melchiorri\n2002).\nWe find that the dependence of overall amplitude of Cl on cosmological parameters for 0.15 < \u03a9m < 0.4 is well approximated\nby\n\n7\n\nFigure 4.

Values of each parameter are shown in each panel of the\nfigure. While varying \u03a9b or h, we have \u03a9b h = 0.035 fixed. The panels for\n\u03a9b and h are to show any residual dependence of Cl on these two parameters.

Note that\nClobs = Cl . The second term in the r.h.s. represents the trispectrum contribution.\n5.1 Halo approach to the angular trispectrum\n\nFigure 6. Mass distribution of Cl . We plot d ln Cl /d ln M , equation (25),\nfor a given l. From right to left it is shown l = 500, 1000, 3000, 5000,\n10000, and 20000, as indicated in the figure.\n\nIn this section we calculate Mll\u2032 , equation (26), using the halo\napproach, and compare it with the hydrodynamic simulations. An\nangular-trispectrum configuration is represented by a quadrilateral,\nand is characterized by four sides and one diagonal (Hu 2001).\nAmong the trispectrum configurations, those which constitute two\nlines whose lengths are l and l\u2032 , respectively, and have zero diagonal, determine the power-spectrum covariance matrix. We denote\nthese as Tll\u2032 (equation 26).\nUsing the halo approach one obtains for the Poisson term\nwhich dominates the trispectrum (Cooray 2001),\nTll\u2032\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ng\u03bd4\n\n0\n\n1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 . For l = 1000 the peak is at 5 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 ,\nwhile for l = 10000 at 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 . The large-angular-scale Cl\nis thus sensitive to the presence of very massive and rare haloes,\nwhich explains why the sampling variance is so large on large\nscales. Much smaller angular scales (< 1\u2032 or l > 10000) receive\nsignificant contribution from smaller mass halos, where uncertain\nphysics of gas cooling, heating, or star formation makes predictions\nunreliable; however, for the angular scales of 2\u2032 \u2212 4\u2032 the dominant\ncontribution is from massive (1014 \u2212 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) clusters for\nwhich these uncertainties are small and which are still so abundant\nthat the sampling variance is small. Fortunately, this is precisely the\nrange targeted by the next generation CMB experiments.\n\n5 COVARIANCE MATRIX OF THE SZ ANGULAR\nPOWER SPECTRUM\nTo determine the cosmological parameters from the power spectrum we need to know its covariance matrix. If fluctuations are\nGaussian, then we can calculate the variance from the spectrum\nitself. If fluctuations are non-Gaussian, then the covariance matrix\nis no longer diagonal. In this case we need to know not only Cl ,\nbut also specific configurations of the angular trispectrum, the harmonic transform of the four-point correlation function, to estimate\nthe covariance matrix.\nThe SZ fluctuations observed in the hydrodynamic simulations are very non-Gaussian (Seljak, Burwell, & Pen 2001; Zhang,\nPen, & Wang 2002; White, Henquist, & Springel 2001). The scatter\namong the Cl estimates is large, especially on large scales, and the\nestimates are strongly correlated. We must thus calculate the full\ncovariance matrix, taking into account the non-Gaussianity. Here\nwe will use both the halo approach (Cooray 2001), and the hydrodynamic simulations (Seljak, Burwell, & Pen 2001), to develop a\nreliable method for covariance matrix calculation.\n\nzmax\n\ndV\ndz\ndz\n\nZ\n\nMmax\n\ndM\n\nMmin\n\ndn(M, z)\ndM\n\n\u00d7 |\u1ef9l (M, z)|2 |\u1ef9l\u2032 (M, z)|2 ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere all the quantities have the same meaning as in equation (1).\nIt follows from equation (26) that (4\u03c0fsky )\u22121 Tll\u2032 determines\nthe non-diagonal terms of Mll\u2032 . Figure 7 shows Tll\u2032 divided by\nCl Cl\u2032 . To make it represent a ratio of the \"non-Gaussian error\"\n(the second term in Mll\u2032 of equation 26) to the \"Gaussian erby\nror\"\np (the first term) we have plotted Tll\u2032 /(Cl Cl\u2032 ) multiplied\n(2l + 1)(2l\u2032 + 1)/8\u03c0, which is this ratio when l = l\u2032 . We find\nthat the ratio decreases with l as l\u22120.95 , or equivalently, Tll \u221d\n3\nl\u22121.95 (Cl )2 , for l >\n\u223c 10 .\nFigure 7 also shows how Mll\u2032 scales with l for a given l\u2032 .

Because of this reason binning does not reduce the error bars\nas much as it would for Gaussian fluctuations.\n5.2 Comparison with the simulated error bars\nTo compare the predicted error bars of Cl with the simulated ones\none must take into account binning or band averaging that the simulations use to produce Cl . If the binned Cl at a given l is the average\nof Cl between l\u2212\u2206l/2 \u2264 l \u2264 l+\u2206l/2, then the covariance matrix\nis\n\u22121\nMll\u2032 \u2248 fsky\n\n\u0014\n\n2 (Cl )2\nT \u2032\n\u03b4ll\u2032 + ll\n(2l + 1)\u2206l\n4\u03c0\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(29)\n\n\fThe Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich angular power spectrum\n\nFigure\n7.\nThe\nSZ\nanp\ngular trispectrum, Tll\u2032 , multiplied by\n(2l + 1)(2l\u2032 + 1)/Cl Cl\u2032 . From\ntop to bottom it is shown l\u2032 = 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 10000, and 20000,\nas indicated in the figure. The solid line shows \u221d l\u22120.95 , which means that\nthe ratio of the non-Gaussian error to the Gaussian error decreases with l as\nl\u22120.95 , and Tll scales as \u221d l\u22121.95 (Cl )2 . The plotted quantity reduces to\nthe correlation coefficient of Cl in the limit of Tll \u226a (Cl )2 .\n\nHere, we have assumed that \u2206l \u226a l. Since both Cl and Tll\u2032 are\nsufficiently smooth, the binning does not affect the values of Cl\nand Tll\u2032 as long as \u2206l \u226a l. We find that \u2206l/l < 0.1 suffices for\nthis approximation to hold.\nFigure 8\u221a compares the predicted fractional errors of Cl ,\n\u2206Cl /Cl \u2261 Mll /Cl , with the simulated ones. We find that the\npredictions agree with the simulations within a factor of two, similar to the agreement we have found for the spectrum itself. There\nis no clear trend in the residuals and we both ovepredict and underpredict the variance compared to the simulations. Since the variance is very sensitive to the sampling errors, it is possible that some\nof the discrepancy is caused by insufficient sampling in the simulations. Figure 8 also plots Gaussian approximation to the errors,\nshowing that our predictions give a significant improvement over\nthe Gaussian approximation. We have also compared the predicted\ncorrelation coefficient, rll\u2032 (equation 28), with the simulations of\nSeljak et al. (2001), finding a good agreement between the two and\nconfirming that for high l the neighboring bins in Cl are strongly\ncorrelated if the binning is sufficiently broad for the trispectrum\nterm to dominate. Proper modeling of cross-correlations between\nthe bins is essential for the parameter-error estimation and for the\nproper treatment of the statistical significance of results.\n\n6 DETERMINATION OF POWER-SPECTRUM\nAMPLITUDE\nIn this section, we analyze how well we can determine \u03c38 by measuring the SZ angular power spectrum with realistic observations,\nand apply it to the recent CBI results (Mason et al. 2002).\n\n9\n\n\u221a\nFigure 8.

We\nhave multiplied the simulated errors by the square-root of a fraction of the\nsky covered by the simulations, fsky . The solid lines show the predicted\nfractional errors, while the dashed lines show the simulated ones. The filled\ncircles show Gaussian approximation to the fractional errors, \u2243 (l\u2206l)\u22121/2\nfor l \u226b 1, where \u2206l is the binning size shown in each panel. The predicted\nerrors agree with the simulated ones within a factor of two, providing a\nsignificant improvement over the Gaussian approximation.\n\nWe perform a least-square fitting to Cl by calculating \u03c72 ,\n\u03c72 \u2261\n\nX\nl\u2264l\u2032\n\n\u0108l \u2212 Cl\n\n\u0001\n\nM \u22121\n\n\u0001\n\nll\u2032\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0108l\u2032 \u2212 Cl\u2032 ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere \u0108l is a reference power spectrum which uses the fiducial\ncosmological parameters, or the actual CBI data. We determine the\nconfidence levels of the parameter estimation by calculating \u2206\u03c72 .\nWe vary \u03a9m and \u03c38 , i.e., \u03c72 = \u03c72 (\u03a9m , \u03c38 ). We fix the other\nparameters at the fiducial values, \u03a9\u039b = 1 \u2212 \u03a9m , \u03a9b = 0.05,\nh = 0.7, w = \u22121.0, and n = 1.0. For a given set of cosmological\nparameters, we calculate Cl and Mll\u2032 and then obtain \u03c72 . By approximating probability distribution function of Cl with a Gaussian\nwe have \u2206\u03c72 = 2.30, 6.17, and 11.8 for 68.3%, 95.4%, and 99.7%\nconfidence levels (C.L.), respectively.\nFirst, we assume that experiments are sampling-variance limited for 2000 < l < 3000, or 2000 < l < 5000; thus, we consider\na few arcminutes angular resolution and ignore instrumental noise.\nTo save computational time we do not evaluate equation (30) at\nevery l, but at 10 points for 2000 < l < 3000, or 20 points for\n2000 < l < 5000. This choice gives \u2206l = 111 and 158, respectively, in equation (29). Both Cl and Tll\u2032 are smooth so that this is\na good approximation.\nFor the sky coverage we consider 1 deg2 or 10 deg2 survey\nof the sky. These parameters are characteristic for the on-going or\nforthcoming experiments: CBI (Padin et al. 2001) for 2000 < l <\n3000 and 1 deg2 , SZA (Holder & Carlstrom 2001) for 2000 <\nl < 3000 and 10 deg2 , AMIBA (Zhang, Pen, & Wang 2002) or\n\n\f10\n\nE. Komatsu & U. Seljak\n\nFigure 9. Contours showing how well we can determine \u03c38 against \u03a9m by\nmeasuring the SZ angular power spectrum with realistic observations. We\nconsider those observations which measure Cl between 2000 < l < 3000,\nand survey 1 deg2 (top panel), or 10 deg2 (bottom panel) of the sky. The\ntop panel is similar to the CBI experiment and the bottom panel to the SZA\nexperiment. The solid line shows \u2206\u03c72 = 2.30 (68.3% C.L.), the dashed\nline \u2206\u03c72 = 6.17 (95.4% C.L.), and the dotted line \u2206\u03c72 = 11.8 (99.7%\nC.L.). The cross marks the fiducial cosmological model. We find that the\ncontour is very sensitive to \u03c38 , yet almost independent of \u03a9m at around\n\u03a9m \u223c 0.2 (see also section 4). We find that a CBI-type observation should\nbe able to determine \u03c38 to within 10% at 2\u03c3, while a SZA-type to within\n5% at the same level.\n\nACT (Lyman Page, private communication) for 2000 < l < 5000\nand 10 deg2 . AMIBA and ACT experiments are actually going to\nsurvey about 100 deg2 of the sky, so that the actual constraints to\nbe obtained from these experiments would be better than we show\nhere.\nFigure 9 shows \u03c72 on a \u03a9m \u2212 \u03c38 plane for the 2000 < l <\n3000 region. The solid line shows \u2206\u03c72 = 2.30 (68.3% C.L.),\nthe dashed line \u2206\u03c72 = 6.17 (95.4% C.L.), and the dotted line\n\u2206\u03c72 = 11.8 (99.7% C.L.). The top panel uses 1 deg2 of the sky,\nclose to the CBI experiment (if it is sampling-variance limited),\nwhile the bottom panel uses 10 deg2 of the sky, close to the SZA\nexperiment. We find that the contours are very sensitive to \u03c38 and\nalmost independent of \u03a9m for 0.15 < \u03a9m < 0.4 (Komatsu &\nKitayama 1999). This is consistent with what we have previously\nshown in section 4 (see equation 22). While for one degree sky\ncoverage the sampling-variance error is similar to the systematic\n(theoretical) error (10% at the 95% confidence level), a 10-times\nlarger survey like SZA with the same angular resolution should be\nable to determine \u03c38 to within 5% at the same level, so at that point\nthe errors will be dominated by the theoretical uncertainty rather\nthan by statistics.\nFigure 10 shows constraints on a \u03a9m \u2212 \u03c38 plane which would\nbe obtained with ACT or AMIBA, whose angular resolution is\n1\u2032 \u2212 2\u2032 . The figure uses 2000 < l < 5000 with 1 deg2 (top panel)\nor 10 deg2 (bottom panel) sky coverage. We find that the statistical\nerror on \u03c38 is extremely small for a 10 deg2 survey. Surveys such\n\nFigure 10. The same figure as figure 9, but for 2000 < l < 5000. We find\nthat statistical errors on \u03c38 are very small for a 10 deg2 survey, showing\nthat ACT or AMIBA experiments which survey about 100 deg2 of the sky\ndetermine \u03c38 with theoretical-uncertainty-limited accuracy (\u223c 10%). A\n1 deg2 survey shown in the top panel is sufficient enough to determine \u03c38\nwith that accuracy.\n\nas ACT or AMIBA covering about 100 deg2 of the sky will determine \u03c38 with accuracy limited by the theoretical uncertainty. This\nis currently at a \u223c 10% level and obviously more theoretical work\nshould improve it in order for the power of the upcoming CMB experiments to be maximally exploited. It is of course still useful to\ncover such a large area of the sky, since this will allow us to use a\nbootstrap error determination without relying on the simulations.\nRecently, CBI and BIMA announced detections of CMB\npower at l \u223c 2000 \u2212 6000, which at face value are inconsistent\nwith the primary CMB alone (Mason et al. 2002; Dawson et al.\n2002). Figure 11 compares the CBI and BIMA data (light-gray\nshaded area, which assumes Gaussian errors) to the predicted SZ\nangular power spectra for \u03c38 = 0.95, 1.05, and 1.15 (thin solid\nlines). We also show the primary CMB anisotropy for the fiducial cosmological model (dashed line), and the sum of the two for\n\u03c38 = 1.05 (thick solid line). The predicted non-Gaussian errors are\nshown for \u03c38 = 1.05 (dark-gray shaded area). We have included\nthe instrumental-noise power spectrum in the non-Gaussian errors\nby using the noise power spectrum of l(l + 1)Cl /(2\u03c0) = 500,\n1000, 1500, and 3000 \u03bcK2 for the CBI bins, and 720 and 2000 \u03bcK2\nfor the BIMA bins. We have assumed the sky coverage of 1 deg2\nfor CBI and 0.1 deg2 for BIMA. From the figure one can see that\nthe data favor \u03c38 \u223c 1 models, and the predicted power spectra can\nexplain the detected excess power reasonably well.\nWe fitted the data to the predicted SZ angular power spectrum using the four bins shown in figure 11 and computing \u03c72\nfrom equation (30). We compute the covariance matrix using equation (29) with the bin-size of \u2206l = 565, 378, 612, 1000, 2870, and\n4150 for each bin. For example, we have obtained r.m.s. error of\n327, 398, 373, 425, 370, and 299 \u03bc K2 at each bin for \u03c38 = 1.05.\nThe cross-correlation between the bins is most significant for the\n\n\fThe Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich angular power spectrum\n\nFigure 11.

The top panel (a) assumes that\nthe detection of the excess power in the all bins is entirely due to\nthe SZ effect (i.e., we ignore the primary CMB anisotropy). We\nfind \u03c38 (\u03a9b h/0.035)2/7 = 1.04 \u00b1 0.12 at 95% confidence limit\nfor 0.1 < \u03a9m < 0.5.\nThe cluster abundance and cosmic-shear constraints are also\nshown in the figure as \u03c38 \u03a90.5\nm = 0.45 \u00b1 0.1, which roughly summarizes the current (systematic dominated) uncertainty from these\nmethods. Combining the two can break the degeneracy between \u03c38\nand \u03a9m and is leading to \u03c38 \u223c 1, \u03a9m \u223c 0.2. One should be cautious not to overinterpret this conclusion, since systematic effects\nin both are still very large and could affect the parameter determination.\nThe bottom panel (b) assumes that the l \u223c 1700 bin is affected by the primary CMB anisotropy, while the other bins are\nentirely due to the SZ effect. We assume that the primary CMB\nis 400 \u03bcK2 at the first bin, roughly consistent with the best-fitting\ntheoretical curve, and is negligible in the other three bins. In principle we should change the primary CMB as well as we change\nthe cosmological parameters; however, for simplicity we just use\n400 \u03bcK2 regardless of the cosmological parameters. We find a similar constraint on the \u03a9m \u2212 \u03c38 plane to the panel (a). In general,\nthe CBI and BIMA data are consistent with detection of the SZ\nfluctuations, and imply \u03c38 (\u03a9b h/0.035)2/7 = 1.04 \u00b1 0.12, but\na somewhat larger survey is needed to confirm this interpretation.\nThe good news is that with a survey just a few times the survey area\nof CBI one should be able to determine \u03c38 with an accuracy com-\n\n11\n\nFigure 12. The CBI and BIMA constraints on the \u03a9m \u2212 \u03c38 plane. The top\npanel (a) assumes that all the data shown in figure 11 are entirely due to\nthe SZ effect. The dashed line shows \u2206\u03c72 = 6.17 (95.4% C.L.) while the\ndotted line \u2206\u03c72 = 11.8 (99.7% C.L.). The cluster abundance and cosmicshear constraints are shown in the figure as \u03c38 \u03a90.5\nm = 0.45 \u00b1 0.1, which\nroughly summarizes the current uncertainty from these methods. The bottom panel (b) assumes that the first bin of the CBI data is affected by the\nprimary CMB anisotropy. In both cases, we find \u03c38 (\u03a9b h/0.035)2/7 =\n1.04 \u00b1 0.12 at the 95.4% confidence level for 0.1 < \u03a9m < 0.5.\n\nparable to or better than any other current observations and with a\ndifferent, and perhaps smaller, systematic uncertainty.\n\n7 UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PREDICTIONS\nThe predictions are very sensitive to the halo mass function, so\nwe investigate how the prediction changes if using different formulae in the literature. We compare four different predictions for\nCl computed with four different formulae for the mass function:\n(JB3) Jenkins et al.'s \u03c4 CDM mass function that uses the SO mass\nwith \u03b4 = 180\u03a9m (z) (Jenkins et al. 2001), (J9) Jenkins et al.'s universal mass function that uses the FOF mass (equation 9 of Jenkins\net al. 2001) and includes smoothing which may systematically increase the mass function in the exponential tail (Hu & Kravtsov\n2002), (HV) Evrard et al.'s Hubble-volume mass function which\nuses the SO mass with \u03b4 = 200 (Evrard et al. 2002), and (PS) Press\n& Schechter's mass function which uses the virial mass (Press &\nSchechter 1974) (this one is of interest just for historical comparison). As Jenkins et al. (2001) note that the FOF mass they use\ncorresponds to the SO mass with \u03b4 = 180\u03a9m (z), we use the SO\nmass to calculate the mass function of (J9).\nThe top-left panel (a) of figure 13 compares Cl computed with\nthe four different mass functions. We find a very good agreement\nbetween (JB3) and (HV), while (J9) predicts higher amplitude. Hu\n& Kravtsov (2002) have also found that the mass function of (J9)\npredicts too many high-mass haloes to agree with their N -body\nsimulations, and concluded that the smoothing used for deriving\n(J9) causes the high-mass halo abundance to increase anomalously.\n\n\f12\n\nE. Komatsu & U. Seljak\n\nFigure 13. Theoretical uncertainty in the SZ angular power spectrum. (a)\nUncertainty in the dark-matter-halo mass function. The solid line shows\nthe prediction with Jenkins et al.'s \u03c4 CDM mass function (equation 6), the\ndashed line Jenkins et al.'s universal mass function (equation 9 of Jenkins\net al. (2001)), and the dot-dashed line Evrard et al.'s Hubble-volume mass\nfunction (Evrard et al. 2002). For comparison, the dotted line plots the prediction with Press & Schechter's mass function (Press & Schechter 1974).\n(b) Uncertainty in the concentration parameter. (c) Uncertainty in the hotgas extension in haloes. The solid line shows Cl with the hot-gas extension\ncut out at 3 times the virial radius, the dashed line at 2 times the virial radius, and the dotted line at the virial radius. (d) Uncertainty in the inner gaspressure profile. The solid line shows Cl with no excision, the dashed line\nshows the one with the region interior to 10% of the virial radius excised,\nthe dotted line 20% of the virial radius, and the dot-dashed line 40% of the\nvirial radius. The dominant contribution to the spectrum is from 20 \u2212 40%\nof the virial radius\n\nJenkins et al. (2001) have explained this in their paper: when deriving (J9), they are mainly interested in small-mass haloes for which\nthe smoothing is less significant. Press & Schechter's mass function predicts lower amplitude and underestimates the abundance\nof high-mass haloes compared with N -body simulations (Jenkins\net al. 2001). As the SZ effect is dominated by the high-mass haloes,\nwe should not use (J9) and (PS), but (JB3) or (HV).\nSince there is no single expression for the concentration parameter c (see equation 10 for definition) we need to quantify\nhow much uncertainty in Cl is due to the uncertainty in the concentration parameter. To quantify this, we use four different formulae for the concentration parameter: (S+B) power-spectrumdetermined concentration parameter at z = 0 (Seljak 2000) but\nevolved by (1 + z)\u22121 , for which evolution has been measured in\nN -body simulations (Bullock et al. 2001), (S) power-spectrum determination with the non-linear mass evaluated at z, (B) halo determination of the concentration parameter (Bullock et al. 2001)\nand (CHM) a different power-spectrum-determined concentration\nparameter (Cooray, Hu, & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2000). The top-right\npanel (b) of figure 13 shows the predictions computed with the four\ndifferent concentration parameters. We find that the uncertainty in\nthe concentration parameter has little effect on Cl .\n\nHow sensitive are the results to the outer radius of the gas profile (shock radius), where the gas temperature rapidly drops to IGM\nvalues? Previous work on a gas profile has assumed that the hot gas\nin haloes extends only up to the virial radius, but numerical simulations suggest a smooth decrease in temperature at least out to\ntwice the virial radius (Bryan & Norman 1998; Eke, Navarro, &\nFrenk 1998; Frenk et al. 1999). The bottom-left panel (c) of figure 13 shows the predicted Cl with the hot-gas extension cut out at\n1, 2, or 3 times the virial radius. While a cut-off at the virial radius\nsuppresses Cl at l < 5000, there is little difference for the cut-off\nat 2rvir and beyond. One should thus include the hot-gas extension\nbeyond the virial radius; otherwise, one underestimates the power\nspectrum on large angular scales, but the actual position of the cutoff is not very important since the power spectrum converges at\n2rvir .\nThe gas density profile in the inner region displays a core\n(Bryan & Norman 1998; Eke, Navarro, & Frenk 1998; Frenk et al.\n1999), which is well reproduced by our model (Komatsu & Seljak 2001). On the other hand, recent X-ray observations have observed a decrease in temperature toward the centre within 5% of\nthe virial radius (McNamara et al. 2000; Allen, Ettori, & Fabian\n2001; Allen et al. 2001; Arnaud et al. 2001a; Arnaud et al. 2001b;\nKaastra et al. 2001), which our polytropic model does not account\nfor. The bottom-right panel (d) of figure 13 shows the predicted Cl\nwith the inner region within 10%, 20%, or 40% of the virial radius excised. We find that the region interior to 10% of the virial\nradius has a negligible contribution to Cl , so the pressure profile in\nthe cluster core has no effect on Cl . From this figure we find that\nthe dominant contribution to Cl comes from around 20 \u2212 40% of\nthe virial radius, roughly corresponding to r2500 , which is just in\nthe range of Chandra satellite for medium redshift clusters (McNamara et al. 2000; Allen, Ettori, & Fabian 2001; Allen et al. 2001)\nand well within XMM/Newton or BeppoSax (Arnaud et al. 2001a;\nArnaud et al. 2001b; Kaastra et al. 2001). Recent observations confirm that the gas profile agrees well with the dark-matter profile in\nthis region (Allen, Schmidt, & Fabian 2002), confirming our basic assumption. We note that the temperature gradient is still small\nover this range, so most of the pressure gradient is caused by the\ngas-density profile.\nThe effect of non-adiabatic physics has been investigated\nwith hydrodynamic simulations. In da Silva et al. (2001b) it has\nbeen claimed that radiative cooling reduces Cl by modest amount,\n20 \u2212 40%, on all angular scales. This is presumably due to a decrease in the gas fraction, since some fraction of gas is being transformed into stars. Despite their extreme cooling treatment (giving\ntoo much cooled material to match the observations) the effect of\nradiative cooling is modest (note that 40% change in Cl gives a 5%\nchange in \u03c38 ). Preheating may lead to a larger effect, as it may alter the gas structure not only in the inner region, but also at larger\nradii, especially for smaller-mass haloes. Some fraction of the gas\nmay be expelled from the cluster, which would suppress the SZ\nfluctuations on small scales. At the same time, preheating increases\nthe gas temperature, which would increase the spectrum. However,\ncare must be taken not to violate the FIRAS constraints on the mean\ny parameter and it is unlikely that this could significantly enhance\nthe SZ power spectrum without violating these limits. Several authors have noticed significant effects of preheating on Cl (Springel,\nWhite, & Hernquist 2001; Holder & Carlstrom 2001; da Silva et al.\n2001b), although current treatments are still over-simplified. One\nmust be careful in analytic models to make them self-consistent,\nas one cannot retain gas in hydrostatic equilibrium within external dark-matter potential using a large gas core and isothermal gas.\n\n\fThe Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich angular power spectrum\nWhen hydrostatic equilibrium is imposed the pressure profile is less\naffected than the density or temperature profiles. It is likely that\nany preheating will have only a modest effect on the SZ power\nspectrum. Recently, White, Henquist, & Springel (2001) have used\nhydrodynamic simulations to show that gas cooling, energy feedback, and star formation affect Cl by no more than a factor of two,\nconfirming our conclusion.\n\n8 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we present a refined analytic model for the angular\npower spectrum of the SZ effect. In contrast to previous modeling (Atrio-Barandela & M\u00fccket 1999; Komatsu & Kitayama 1999;\nCooray 2000; Molnar & Birkinshaw 2000; Holder & Carlstrom\n2001; Zhang & Pen 2001), our model has no free parameters and\ntreats the gas in a cluster dark-matter potential self-consistently, using the universal gas-density and temperature profile (Komatsu &\nSeljak 2001), which fits the observed and the simulated properties\nof clusters of galaxies in the range of interest to the SZ observations\n(outside 5% of the virial radius).\nWe compare our predictions for the spectrum and the errors\nwith the hydrodynamic SZ simulations and find a good agreement.\nThe deviations between our model and the simulations are comparable to the deviations among the simulations themselves and\nare particularly small in the observationally relevant range around\nl \u223c 3000. Some of the discrepancies are due to either poor resolution in the simulations or sampling variance, while the remaining difference could be due to the simplifying assumptions of gas\nphysics in our model, such as hydrostatic equilibrium, spherical\nsymmetry, merging and substructure, which may be inaccurate in\nparticular at higher redshifts when the clusters are still forming.\nThe disagreement is more important on very small angular scales\n(l > 5000), while the accuracy of our predictions in the range of\nl \u223c 2000 \u2212 5000 is better than a factor of two, which translates\nto less than 10% systematic uncertainty in the amplitude of fluctuations \u03c38 . We also compare analytic predictions for the powerspectrum covariance matrix to the simulations and find similarly\ngood agreement.\nWe investigate the dependence of Cl on various cosmological\nparameters, finding that over the range of interest \u03c38 and \u03a9b h determine the amplitude of Cl almost entirely, as has been pointed\nout by several authors before as well (Komatsu & Kitayama 1999;\nSeljak et al. 2001; Zhang & Pen 2001; Zhang et al. 2002). It is particularly important that the matter density of the universe does not\naffect the spectrum as much as \u03c38 does, in agreement with Komatsu\n& Kitayama (1999). This differs from the local-cluster-abundance\nstudies, where the constraint is usually on \u03c38 \u03a90.5\nm .\nThe dominant contribution to Cl comes from massive clusters (M > 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 for l < 5000) at moderate (z \u223c 1)\nredshift. Within the cluster, the dominant contribution comes from\naround 0.2 \u2212 0.4rvir , suggesting that the physical processes taking place in the cluster core such as cooling, heating or heat conduction have little effect on the SZ power spectrum. We assume\nthat the gas fraction is close to the cosmic mean baryon fraction,\nwhich is reasonable for massive clusters and has observational support in low stellar-mass-to-cluster-mass ratios in massive clusters\n(e.g., Fukugita, Hogan, & Peebles 1998), as well as in studies of\nthe gas fraction as a function of radius (e.g., Allen, Schmidt, &\nFabian 2002). While more exotic mechanisms such as preheating\ncould affect Cl on all scales (by increasing the temperature and/or\nreducing the gas clumping), they are constrained by the FIRAS lim-\n\n13\n\nits and are unlikely to make more than a factor of two change in Cl\n(comparable to a 10% change in \u03c38 ).\nUsing analytic predictions for the spectrum and its covariance\nmatrix we have performed a likelihood analysis to estimate how\nwell we can measure \u03c38 against \u03a9m with realistic SZ observations.\nThe likelihood is very sensitive to \u03c38 almost independent of \u03a9m\n(figure 9 or 10). By performing the likelihood analysis on the recently reported CBI (Mason et al. 2002) and BIMA (Dawson et al.\n2002) detections at the level of 15 \u2212 20 \u03bcK at l \u223c 2000 \u2212 6000\n(figure 11), we find \u03c38 (\u03a9b h/0.035)2/7 = 1.04 \u00b1 0.12 at the 95%\nstatistical confidence level. To this we should add about 10% systematic theoretical uncertainty due to the simplified modeling in\nour model, the numerical issues in the simulations, and missing\nphysics in both. We should note that most of the effects we have ignored within our model tend to further increase \u03c38 : assumed fiducial value for \u03a9b h = 0.035 is somewhat high, we ignored fraction\nof gas transformed into stars, and our predictions are somewhat\nhigher than the simulation results at the angular scales relevant for\nCBI and BIMA. These effects would further increase \u03c38 , although\nnot by more than 5 \u2212 10%. Such a high value for \u03c38 is in tension\nwith the primary CMB amplitude determination (Lahav et al. 2002)\nand Ly-\u03b1 forest determination (Croft et al. 1999; McDonald et al.\n2000), although it can be accommodated by the cluster abundance\nand the weak lensing results if \u03a9m \u223c 0.2 \u00b1 0.1. While the CBI\nexperiment is surveying 1 deg2 of the sky and still has a large instrumental noise, a somewhat larger sky coverage with lower noise\n(e.g., SZA) would significantly reduce the statistical errors on \u03c38 .\nSurveys with 100 deg2 such as ACT or AMIBA should be able to\nmeasure both the power spectrum and its covariance matrix (e.g. by\nusing bootstrap sampling) to exquisite precision.\nIn conclusion, measurement of the angular power spectrum of\nthe SZ effect offers a promising way to determine \u03c38 , since it is\nvery sensitive to its value and is almost independent of \u03a9m . It is\nfree of observational selection effects such as flux, surface brightness, or volume limit of the survey. It does not require the mass\nof sampled haloes to be measured, and there is no uncertainty associated with the mass\u2013flux calibration. Finally, it is within reach\nof the next generation of small-scale CMB experiments and may\nhave already been detected by the CBI and BIMA experiments, in\nwhich case their results imply that the amplitude of fluctuations at\n8 h\u22121 Mpc scale is of order unity.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank Antonio C. da Silva, Alexandre Refregier,\nVolker Springel, Pengjie Zhang, and their collaborators for providing us with their hydrodynamic simulation data results.

The second column shows the name of a code which each simulation uses:\nMMH (=Moving-Mesh Hydrodynamic code) (Pen 1998), and RAMSES (adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic code) (Teyssier 2002) are mesh codes,\nwhile GADGET (=GAlaxies with Dark matter and Gas intEracT code) (Springel, Yoshida, & White 2001), and HYDRA (Pearce & Couchman 1997) are\nSPH (=Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamic) codes. The third column shows the number of grids for mesh codes (MMH and RAMSES), or the number of\nSPH particles for SPH codes (GADGET and HYDRA).

We do this by solving the following equation,\ns\u2217 \u2261\n\nd ln \u03c1gas (x)\nd ln x\n\nd ln \u03c1dm (x)\nd ln x\n\n=\nx=x\u2217\n\n,\n\n(A1)\n\nx=x\u2217\n\nwhere s\u2217 denotes a slope of the dark-matter density profile at a\nmatching radius x\u2217 .\nIn previous paper (Komatsu & Seljak 2001) we have shown\nthat equation (A1) determines \u03b7(0) uniquely for a given \u03b3,\n\u03b7(0)\n\n=\n\n\u03b3 \u22121\n\n\u001a\u0010\n\n\u22123\ns\u2217\n\n\u0011\u0014\n\nx\u22121\n\u2217 m(x\u2217 )\nc\u22121 m(c)\n\n+3(\u03b3 \u2212 1)\n\n\u0014\n\nc\nm(c)\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015Z\n\nx\u2217\n\ndu\n\n0\n\nm(u)\nu2\n\n\u001b\n\n,\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere m(x) is a non-dimensional dark-matter mass profile defined\nby\nm(x) \u2261\n\n\u03c1\u22121\ns\n\nZ\n\nx\n2\n\ndu u \u03c1dm (u),\n\n(A3)\n\n0\n\nand \u03c1s is a scale density. Equation (A2) makes the matching condition, equation (A1), satisfied at radius x\u2217 .\nNext, we require that \u03b7(0) does not depend upon a particular\nchoice of x\u2217 ; this requirement specifies \u03b3 uniquely. While we have\ndone this by finding an empirical fitting formula for \u03b3 in the previous paper (equation 25 of Komatsu & Seljak 2001), we derive here\nan exact formula for \u03b3 by solving the following equation,\n\u2202\u03b7(0)\n\u2202x\u2217\n\n= 0,\n\n(A4)\n\nx\u2217 =c\n\nwhere c is the concentration parameter (see equation 10 for definition). This equation means that \u03b7(0) normalization does not depend\nupon the particular choice of x\u2217 .\nWe find that equation (A4) gives \u03b3 as a function of c,\n\u03b3 =1\u2212\n\n1\ns\u2217\n\n+\nx\u2217 =c\n\n\u2202 ln [m(x\u2217 )/s\u2217 ]\ns\u2217 \u2202 ln x\u2217\n\n.\n\n(A5)\n\nx\u2217 =c\n\nThis formula gives the polytropic index of gas in haloes with any\ngiven dark-matter density profiles.\nHereafter, we evaluate \u03b3 and \u03b7(0) for the NFW profile\n(Navarro, Frenk, & White 1997), \u03c1dm (x) = \u03c1s x\u22121 (1 + x)\u22122 . We\nfind\n1 + 3x\u2217\n,\n(A6)\ns\u2217 = \u2212\n1 + x\u2217\nand\nm(x) = ln(1 + x) \u2212\n\nx\n.\n1+x\n\n(A7)\n\nBy substituting s\u2217 and m(x) into equation (A5), we obtain \u03b3. We\nthen substitute s\u2217 , m(x), and the derived \u03b3 into (A2) to obtain \u03b7(0).\nThe upper panel of figure A1 shows \u03b3 as a function of c\ncompared to the fitting formula in equation (17). For comparison,\nthe figure also plots the fitting formula which we have given for\n4 < c < 11 in Komatsu & Seljak (2001). The new formula, equation (17), is valid for 1 < c < 25.\n\nFigure A1. The top panel shows the polytropic index of gas in haloes, \u03b3,\nwhile the bottom panel shows the mass\u2013central temperature normalization\nfactor, \u03b7(0) (equation 19), as a function of the concentration parameter c.\nThe solid lines plot exact values calculated from equation (A5) and (A2)\nfor \u03b3 and \u03b7(0), respectively. The dotted lines plot the best-fitting formulae,\nequation (17) and (18) for \u03b3 and \u03b7(0), respectively. The dashed lines plot\nthe fitting formulae given in Komatsu & Seljak (2001) for 4 < c < 11.\n\nBy substituting \u03b3 from equation (A5) into equation (A2) we\nobtain \u03b7(0) as a function of c. The bottom panel of figure A1 shows\n\u03b7(0) as a function of c and also the fitting formula \u03b7(0) in equation\n(18). For comparison, the figure also plots the fitting formula given\nin Komatsu & Seljak (2001).\n\n\f"}
