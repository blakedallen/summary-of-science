There are\ntwo important pieces of evidence that the scale factor of the Universe was once\nmuch smaller than it is today, and correspondingly that its temperature was much\nhigher. One is the Cosmic Microwave Background 1 , which bathes us in photons\nwith a density\nn\u03b3 \u2243 400 cm\u22123 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith an effective temperature T \u2243 2.7 K. These photons were released when electrons and nuclei combined to form atoms, when the Universe was some 3000 times\nhotter and the scale factor correspondingly 3000 times smaller than it is today. The\nsecond is the agreement of the Abundances of Light Elements 2 , in particular those\nof 4 He, Deuterium and 6 Li, with calculations of cosmological nucelosynthesis. For\nthese elements to have been produced by nuclear fusion, the Universe must once\nhave been some 109 times hotter and smaller than it is today.\nDuring this epoch of the history of the Universe, its energy density would have\nbeen dominated by relativistic particles such as photons and neutrinos, in which\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n1\n\n\fcase the age t of the Universe is given approximately by\n1\n.\n(3)\nT2\nThe constant of proportionality between time and temperature is such that t \u2243\n1 second when the temperature T \u2243 1 MeV, near the start of cosmological nucleosynthesis. Since typical particle energies in a thermal plasma are O(T ), and the\nBoltzmann distribution guarantees large densities of particles weighing O(T ), the\nhistory of the earlier Universe when T > O(1) MeV was dominated by elementary\nparticles weighing an MeV or more 3 .\nThe landmarks in the history of the Universe during its first second presumably\nincluded the epoch when protons and neutrons were created out of quarks, when\nT \u223c 200 MeV and t \u223c 10\u22125 s. Prior to that, there was an epoch when the\nsymmetry between weak and electromagnetic interactions was broken, when T \u223c\n100 GeV and t \u223c 10\u221210 s. Laboratory experiments with accelerators have already\nexplored physics at energies E <\n\u223c 100 GeV, and the energy range E <\n\u223c 1000 GeV,\n\u221212\n10\ns,\nwill\nbe\nexplored at\ncorresponding to the history of the Universe when t >\n\u223c\n4\nCERN's LHC accelerator that is scheduled to start operation in 2007 . Our ideas\nabout physics at earlier epochs are necessarily more speculative, but one possibility\nis that there was an inflationary epoch when the age of the Universe was somewhere\nbetween 10\u221240 and 10\u221230 s.\nWe return later to possible experimental probes of the physics of these early\nepochs, but first we review the Standard Model of particle physics, which underlies\nour description of the Universe since it was 10\u221210 s old.\nt \u221d a2 \u221d\n\n1.2\n\nSummary of the Standard Model of Particle Physics\n\nThe Standard Model of particle physics has been established by a series of experiments and theoretical developments over the past century 5 , including:\n\u2022 1897 - The discovery of the electron;\n\u2022 1910 - The discovery of the nucleus;\n\u2022 1930 - The nucleus found to be made of protons and neutrons; neutrino postulated;\n\u2022 1936 - The muon discovered;\n\u2022 1947 - Pion and strange particles discovered;\n\u2022 1950's - Many strongly-interacting particles discovered;\n\u2022 1964 - Quarks proposed;\n\u2022 1967 - The Standard Model proposed;\n\u2022 1973 - Neutral weak interactions discovered;\n\u2022 1974 - The charm quark discovered;\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n2\n\n\f\u2022 1975 - The \u03c4 lepton discovered;\n\u2022 1977 - The bottom quark discovered;\n\u2022 1979 - The gluon discovered;\n\u2022 1983 - The intermediate W \u00b1 , Z 0 bosons discovered;\n\u2022 1989 - Three neutrino species counted;\n\u2022 1994 - The top quark discovered;\n\u2022 1998 - Neutrino oscillations discovered.\nAll the above historical steps, apart from the last (which was made with neutrinos from astrophysical sources), fit within the Standard Model, and the Standard\nModel continues to survive all experimental tests at accelerators.\nThe Standard Model contains the following set of spin-1/2 matter particles:\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\u03bde\n(4)\n,\n,\nLeptons :\n\u03c4\n\u03bc\ne\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013\nu\nc\nb\nQuarks :\n,\n,\n(5)\nd\ns\nt\nWe know from experiments at CERN's LEP accelerator in 1989 that there can there\ncan only be three neutrinos 6 :\nN\u03bd = 2.9841 \u00b1 0.0083,\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is a couple of standard deviations below 3, but that cannot be considered\na significant discrepancy. I had always hoped that N\u03bd might turn out to be noninteger: N\u03bd = \u03c0 would have been good, and N\u03bd = e would have been even better,\nbut this was not to be! The constraint (6) is also important for possible physics\nbeyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry as we discuss later. The\nmeasurement (6) implies, by extension, that there can only be three charged leptons\nand hence no more quarks, by analogy and in order to preserve the calculability of\nthe Standard Model 7 .\nThe forces between these matter particles are carried by spin-1 bosons: electromagnetism by the familiar massless photon \u03b3, the weak interactions by the massive\nintermediate W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons that weigh \u2243 80, 91 GeV, respectively, and the\nstrong interactions by the massless gluon. Among the key objectives of particle\nphysics are attempts to unify these different interactions, and to explain the very\ndifferent masses of the various matter particles and spin-1 bosons.\nSince the Standard Model is the rock on which our quest for new physics must\nbe built, we now review its basic features 5 and examine whether its successes offer\nany hint of the direction in which to search for new physics. Let us first recall the\nstructure of the charged-current weak interactions, which have the current-current\nform:\n1\nGF\nLcc = \u221a J\u03bc+ J \u2212\u03bc ,\n(7)\n4\n2\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n3\n\n\fwhere the charged currents violate parity maximally:\nJ\u03bc+ = \u03a3l=e,\u03bc,\u03c4 l\u0304\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\u03bdl + similarly for quarks.\n\n(8)\n\nThe charged current (8) can be interpreted as a generator of a weak SU(2) isospin\nsymmetry acting on the matter-particle doublets in (5). The matter fermions with\nleft-handed helicities are doublets of this weak SU(2), whereas the right-handed\nmatter fermions are singlets. It was suggested already in the 1930's, and with more\nconviction in the 1960's, that the structure (8) could most naturally be obtained\nby exchanging massive W \u00b1 vector bosons with coupling g and mass mW :\nGF\ng2\n\u221a \u2261\n.\n(9)\n8m2W\n2\nIn 1973, neutral weak interactions with an analogous current-current structure were\ndiscovered at CERN:\nGN C\n1\nJ\u03bc0 J \u03bc0 ,\n(10)\nLN C = \u221aF\n4\n2\nand it was natural to suggest that these might also be carried by massive neutral\nvector bosons Z 0 .\nThe W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons were discovered at CERN in 1983, so let us now review\nthe theory of them, as well as the Higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking by which we believe they acquire masses 8 .

It is well known that a massless vector boson\nsuch as the photon \u03b3 or gluon g has just two polarization states: \u03bb = \u00b11. However,\na massive vector boson such as the \u03c1 has three polarization states: \u03bb = 0, \u00b11. This\nthird polarization state is provided by a spin-0 field. In order to make mW \u00b1 ,Z 0 6= 0,\nthis should have non-zero electroweak isospin I 6= 0, and the simplest possibility\nis a complex isodoublet (\u03c6+ , \u03c60 ), as assumed above. This has four degrees of freedom, three of which are eaten by the W \u00b1 amd Z 0 as their third polarization states,\nleaving us with\n\u221a one physical\u221aHiggs boson H. Once the vacuum expectation value\n|h0|\u03c6|0i| = v/ 2 : v = \u03bc/ 2\u03bb is fixed, the mass of the remaining physical Higgs\nboson is given by\nm2H = 2\u03bc2 = 4\u03bbv 2 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhich is a free parameter in the Standard Model.\n1.3\n\nPrecision Tests of the Standard Model\n\nThe quantity that was measured most accurately at LEP was the mass of the Z 0\nboson 6 :\nmZ = 91, 187.5 \u00b1 2.1 MeV,\n\n(25)\n\nas seen in Fig. 1. Strikingly, mZ is now known more accurately than the muon decay\nconstant! Attaining this precision required understanding astrophysical effects those of terrestrial tides on the LEP beam energy, which were O(10) MeV, as well\nas meteorological - when it rained, the water expanded the rock in which LEP was\nburied, again changing the beam energy, and seasonal - variations in the level of\nwater in Lake Geneva also caused the rock around LEP to expand and contract as well as electrical - stray currents from the nearby electric train line affected the\nLEP magnets 9 .\nLEP experiments also made precision measurements of many properties of the\nZ 0 boson 6 , such as the total cross section:\n\u03c3 =\n\n12\u03c0 \u0393ee \u0393had\n,\nm2Z \u03932Z\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u0393Z (\u0393ee , \u0393had ) is the total Z 0 decay rate (rate for decays into e+ e\u2212 , hadrons).\nEq. (26) is the classical (tree-level) expression, which is reduced by about 30 % by\nradiative corrections. The total decay rate is given by:\n\u0393Z = \u0393ee + \u0393\u03bc\u03bc + \u0393\u03c4 \u03c4 + N\u03bd \u0393\u03bd\u03bd + \u0393had ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere we expect \u0393ee = \u0393\u03bc\u03bc = \u0393\u03c4 \u03c4 because of lepton universality, which has been\nverified experimentally, as seen in Fig. 2 6 .

Various other measurements are also shown\nthere, including the mass and decay rate of the W \u00b1 , the mass of the top quark,\nand low-energy neutral-current measurements in \u03bd-nucleon scattering and parity\nviolation in atomic Cesium. The Standard Model is quite compatible with all\nthese measurements, although some of them may differ by a couple of standard\ndeviations: if they did not, we should be suspicious!

Estimate of the mass of the Higgs boson obtained from precision electroweak measurements. The blue band indicates theoretical uncertainties, and the different curves demonstrate\nthe effects of different plausible estimates of the renormalization of the fine-structure constant at\nthe Z 0 peak 6 .\n\nThe measurements of these electroweak observables enabled the mass of the top\nquark to be predicted before it was discovered, and the measured value:\nmt = 174.3 \u00b1 5.1 GeV\n\n(31)\n\nagrees quite well with the prediction\nmt = 177.5 \u00b1 9.3 GeV\n\n(32)\n\nderived from precision electroweak data 6 .

This\nprediction can be made more definite by combining the precision electroweak data\nwith the measurement (31) of the mass of the top quark. Making due allowance\nfor theoretical uncertainties in the Standard Model calculations, as seen in Fig. 4,\none may estimate that 6 :\nmH = 91+58\n\u221237 GeV,\n\n(34)\n\nwhereas mH is not known from first principles in the Standard Model.\nThe Higgs production and decay rates are completely fixed as functions of the\nunknown mass mH , enabling the search for the Higgs boson to be planned as a\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n9\n\n\ffunction of mH 12 . This search was one of the main objectives of experiments at\nLEP, which established the lower limit:\nmH > 114.4 GeV,\n\n(35)\n\nthat is shown as the light yellow shaded region in Fig. 4. Combining this limit\nwith the estimate (34), we see that there is good reason to expect that the Higgs\nboson may not be far away. Indeed, in the closing weeks of the LEP experimental\nprogramme, there was a hint for the discovery of the Higgs boson at LEP with a\nmass \u223c 115 GeV, but this could not be confirmed 13 . In the future, experiments\nat the Fermilab Tevatron collider and then the LHC will continue the search for\nthe Higgs boson. The latter, in particular, should be able to discover it whatever\n4\nits mass may be, up to the theoretical upper limit mH <\n\u223c 1 TeV .\n1.5\n\nRoadmap to Physics Beyond the Standard Model\n\nThe Standard Model agrees with all confirmed experimental data from accelerators,\nbut is theoretically very unsatisfactory 14,15 . It does not explain the particle\nquantum numbers, such as the electric charge Q, weak isospin I, hypercharge Y\nand colour, and contains at least 19 arbitrary parameters. These include three\nindependent vector-boson couplings and a possible CP-violating strong-interaction\nparameter, six quark and three charged-lepton masses, three generalized Cabibbo\nweak mixing angles and the CP-violating Kobayashi-Maskawa phase, as well as two\nindependent masses for weak bosons.\nThe Big Issues in physics beyond the Standard Model are conveniently grouped\ninto three categories 14,15 . These include the problem of Mass: what is the origin\nof particle masses, are they due to a Higgs boson, and, if so, why are the masses so\nsmall; Unification: is there a simple group framework for unifying all the particle\ninteractions, a so-called Grand Unified Theory (GUT); and Flavour: why are there\nso many different types of quarks and leptons and why do their weak interactions\nmix in the peculiar way observed? Solutions to all these problems should eventually\nbe incorporated in a Theory of Everything (TOE) that also includes gravity, reconciles it with quantum mechanics, explains the origin of space-time and why it has\nfour dimensions, makes coffee, etc. String theory, perhaps in its current incarnation\nof M theory, is the best (only?) candidate we have for such a TOE 16 , but we do\nnot yet understand it well enough to make clear experimental predictions.\nAs if the above 19 parameters were insufficient to appall you, at least nine more\nparameters must be introduced to accommodate the neutrino oscillations discussed\nin the next Lecture: 3 neutrino masses, 3 real mixing angles, and 3 CP-violating\nphases, of which one is in principle observable in neutrino-oscillation experiments\nand the other two in neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. In fact even the\nsimplest models for neutrino masses involve 9 further parameters, as discussed later.\nMoreover, there are many other cosmological parameters that we should also\nseek to explain. Gravity is characterized by at least two parameters, the Newton\nconstant GN and the cosmological vacuum energy. We may also want to construct\na field-theoretical model for inflation, and we certainly need to explain the baryon\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n10\n\n\fasymmetry of the Universe. So there is plenty of scope for physics beyond the\nStandard Model.\nThe first clear evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle\nphysics has been provided by neutrino physics, which is also of great interest for\ncosmology, so this is the subject of Lecture 2. Since there are plenty of good reasons to study supersymmetry 15 , including the possibility that it provides the cold\ndark matter, this is the subject of Lecture 3. Inflation is the subject of Lecture 4,\nand various further topics such as GUTs, baryo/leptogenesis and ultra-high-energy\ncosmic rays are discussed in Lecture 5. As we shall see later, neutrino physics may\nbe the key to both inflation and baryogenesis.\n2\n2.1\n\nNeutrino Physics\nNeutrino Masses?\n\nThere is no good reason why either the total lepton number L or the individual\nlepton flavours Le,\u03bc,\u03c4 should be conserved. Theorists have learnt that the only conserved quantum numbers are those associated with exact local symmetries, just as\nthe conservation of electromagnetic charge is associated with local U(1) invariance.\nOn the other hand, there is no exact local symmetry associated with any of the\nlepton numbers, so we may expect non-zero neutrino masses.\nHowever, so far we have only upper experimental limits on neutrino masses 17 .\nFrom measurements of the end-point in Tritium \u03b2 decay, we know that:\nm\u03bde <\n\u223c 2.5 eV,\n\n(36)\n\nm\u03bd\u03bc < 190 KeV,\n\n(37)\n\nwhich might be improved down to about 0.5 eV with the proposed KATRIN experiment 18 . From measurements of \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd decay, we know that:\nand there are prospects to improve this limit by a factor \u223c 20. Finally, from\nmeasurements of \u03c4 \u2192 n\u03c0\u03bd decay, we know that:\nm\u03bd\u03c4 < 18.2 MeV,\n\n(38)\n\nand there are prospects to improve this limit to \u223c 5 MeV.\nAstrophysical upper limits on neutrino masses are stronger than these laboratory limits. The 2dF data were used to infer an upper limit on the sum of the\nneutrino masses of 1.8 eV 19 , which has recently been improved using WMAP data\nto 20\n\u03a3\u03bdi m\u03bdi < 0.7 eV,\n\n(39)\n\nas seen in Fig. 5. This impressive upper limit is substantially better than even the\nmost stringent direct laboratory upper limit on an individual neutrino mass.\nAnother interesting laboratory limit on neutrino masses comes from searches for\nneutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay, which constrain the sum of the neutrinos' Majorana\nmasses weighted by their couplings to electrons 21 :\n2 <\n| \u223c 0.35 eV\nhm\u03bd ie \u2261 |\u03a3\u03bdi m\u03bdi Uei\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n(40)\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 5. Likelihood function for the sum of neutrino masses provided by WMAP 20 : the quoted\nupper limit applies if the 3 light neutrino species are degenerate.\n\nwhich might be improved to \u223c 0.01 eV in a future round of experiments.\nNeutrinos have been seen to oscillate between their different flavours 22,23 ,\nshowing that the separate lepton flavours Le,\u03bc,\u03c4 are indeed not conserved, though\nthe conservation of total lepton number L is still an open question. The observation\nof such oscillations strongly suggests that the neutrinos have different masses.\n2.2\n\nModels of Neutrino Masses and Mixing\n\nThe conservation of lepton number is an accidental symmetry of the renormalizable\nterms in the Standard Model Lagrangian. However, one could easily add to the\nStandard Model non-renormalizable terms that would generate neutrino masses,\neven without introducing any new fields. For example, a non-renormalizable term\nof the form 24\n1\n\u03bdH * \u03bdH,\n(41)\nM\nwhere M is some large mass beyond the scale of the Standard Model, would generate\na neutrino mass term:\nh0|H|0i2\n.\n(42)\nm\u03bd \u03bd * \u03bd : m\u03bd =\nM\nHowever, a new interaction like (41) seems unlikely to be fundamental, and one\nshould like to understand the origin of the large mass scale M .\nThe minimal renormalizable model of neutrino masses requires the introduction\nof weak-singlet 'right-handed' neutrinos N . These will in general couple to the\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n12\n\n\fconventional weak-doublet left-handed neutrinos via Yukawa couplings Y\u03bd that yield\nDirac masses mD = Y\u03bd h0|H|0i \u223c mW . In addition, these 'right-handed' neutrinos\nN can couple to themselves via Majorana masses M that may be \u226b mW , since\nthey do not require electroweak summetry breaking. Combining the two types of\nmass term, one obtains the seesaw mass matrix 25 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n0 MD\n\u03bdL\n(\u03bdL , N )\n,\n(43)\nT\nMD\nM\nN\n\nwhere each of the entries should be understood as a matrix in generation space.\nIn order to provide the two measured differences in neutrino masses-squared,\nthere must be at least two non-zero masses, and hence at least two heavy singlet\nneutrinos Ni 26,27 . Presumably, all three light neutrino masses are non-zero, in\nwhich case there must be at least three Ni . This is indeed what happens in simple\nGUT models such as SO(10), but some models 28 have more singlet neutrinos 29 .\nIn this Lecture, for simplicity we consider just three Ni .\nThe effective mass matrix for light neutrinos in the seesaw model may be written\nas:\n1\n(44)\nM\u03bd = Y\u03bdT Y\u03bd v 2 ,\nM\nwhere we have used the relation mD = Y\u03bd v with v \u2261 h0|H|0i. Taking mD \u223c mq\nor ml and requiring light neutrino masses \u223c 10\u22121 to 10\u22123 eV, we find that heavy\nsinglet neutrinos weighing \u223c 1010 to 1015 GeV seem to be favoured.\nIt is convenient to work in the field basis where the charged-lepton masses ml\u00b1\nand the heavy singlet-neutrino mases M are real and diagonal. The seesaw neutrino\nmass matrix M\u03bd (44) may then be diagonalized by a unitary transformation U :\nU T M\u03bd U = Md\u03bd .\n\n(45)\n\nThis diagonalization is reminiscent of that required for the quark mass matrices in\nthe Standard Model. In that case, it is well known that one can redefine the phases\nof the quark fields 30 so that the mixing matrix UCKM has just one CP-violating\nphase 31 . However, in the neutrino case, there are fewer independent field phases,\nand one is left with 3 physical CP-violating parameters:\n\u0001\n(46)\nU = P\u03032 V P0 : P0 \u2261 Diag ei\u03c61 , ei\u03c62 , 1 .\n\u0001\nHere P\u03032 = Diag ei\u03b11 , ei\u03b12 , ei\u03b13 contains three phases that can be removed by\nphase rotations and are unobservable in light-neutrino physics, though they do play\na r\u00f4le at high energies, as discussed in Lecture 5, V is the light-neutrino mixing\nmatrix first considered by Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata (MNS) 32 , and P0 contains\n2 CP-violating phases \u03c61,2 that are observable at low energies.

The other CP-violating phases \u03c61,2 are in principle\nobservable in neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay (40).\n2.3\n\nNeutrino Oscillations\n\nIn quantum physics, particles such as neutrinos propagate as complex waves. Different mass eigenstates mi travelling with the same momenta p oscillate with different\nfrequencies:\neiEi t : Ei2 = p2 + m2i .\n\n(48)\n\nNow consider what happens if one produces a neutrino beam of one given flavour,\ncorresponding to some specific combination of mass eigenstates. After propagating\nsome distance, the different mass eigenstates in the beam will acquire different phase\nweightings (48), so that the neutrinos in the beam will be detected as a mixture\nof different neutrino flavours. These oscillations will be proportional to the mixing\nsin2 2\u03b8 between the different flavours, and also to the differences in masses-squared\n\u2206m2ij between the different mass eigenstates.\nThe first of the mixing angles in (47) to be discovered was \u03b823 , in atmospheric\nneutrino experiments. Whereas the numbers of downward-going atmospheric \u03bd\u03bc\nwere found to agree with Standard Model predictions, a deficit of upward-going \u03bd\u03bc\nwas observed, as seen in Fig. 6. The data from the Super-Kamiokande experiment,\nin particular 22 , favour near-maximal mixing of atmospheric neutrinos:\n\u03b823 \u223c 45o , \u2206m223 \u223c 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 .\n\n(49)\n\nRecently, the K2K experiment using a beam of neutrinos produced by an accelerator\nhas found results consistent with (49) 33 . It seems that the atmospheric \u03bd\u03bc probably\noscillate primarily into \u03bd\u03c4 , though this has yet to be established.\nMore recently, the oscillation interpretation of the long-standing solar-neutrino\ndeficit has been established, in particular by the SNO experiment. Solar neutrino\nexperiments are sensitive to the mixing angle \u03b812 in (47). The recent data from\nSNO 23 and Super-Kamiokande 34 prefer quite strongly the large-mixing-angle\n(LMA) solution to the solar neutrino problem with\n\u03b812 \u223c 30o , \u2206m212 \u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\n(50)\n\nthough they have been unable to exclude completely the LOW solution with lower\n\u03b4m2 . However, the KamLAND experiment on reactors produced by nuclear power\nreactors has recently found a deficit of \u03bde that is highly compatible with the LMA\nsolution to the solar neutrino problem 35 , as seen in Fig. 7, and excludes any other\nsolution.\nUsing the range of \u03b812 allowed by the solar and KamLAND data, one can establish a correlation between the relic neutrino density \u03a9\u03bd h2 and the neutrinoless\ndouble-\u03b2 decay observable hm\u03bd ie , as seen in Fig. 8 37 .

A fortiori, we\nhave no experimental information on the CP-violating phase \u03b4.\nThe phase \u03b4 could in principle be measured by comparing the oscillation probabilities for neutrinos and antineutrinos and computing the CP-violating asymmetry 39 :\nP (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) \u2212 P (\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) = 16s12 c12 s13 c213 s23 c23 sin \u03b4\n(53)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n2\n2\n\u2206m13\n\u2206m23\n\u2206m12\nL sin\nL sin\nL ,\nsin\n4E\n4E\n4E\nas seen in Fig. 9 40 .

Beyond\nthese, ideas are being proposed for intense 'super-beams' of low-energy neutrinos,\nproduced by high-intensity, low-energy accelerators such as the SPL 41 proposed at\nCERN. A subsequent step could be a storage ring for unstable ions, whose decays\nwould produce a '\u03b2 beam' of pure \u03bde or \u03bd\u0304e neutrinos. These experiments might be\nable to measure \u03b4 via CP and/or T violation in neutrino oscillations 42 . A final\nstep could be a full-fledged neutrino factory based on a muon storage ring, which\nwould produce pure \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u0304e (or \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc beams and provide a greatly enhanced\ncapability to search for or measure \u03b4 via CP violation in neutrino oscillations 43 .\nWe have seen above that the effective low-energy mass matrix for the light\nneutrinos contains 9 parameters, 3 mass eigenvalues, 3 real mixing angles and 3\nCP-violating phases. However, these are not all the parameters in the minimal\nseesaw model. As shown in Fig. 10, this model has a total of 18 parameters 44,45 .\nThe additional 9 parameters comprise the 3 masses of the heavy singlet 'righthanded' neutrinos Mi , 3 more real mixing angles and 3 more CP-violating phases.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 10, many of these may be observable via renormalization\nin supersymmetric models 46,45,47,48 , which may generate observable rates for\nflavour-changing lepton decays such as \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3, and CPviolating observables such as electric dipole moments for the electron and muon.\nSome of these extra parametrs may also have controlled the generation of matter\nin the Universe via leptogenesis 49 , as discussed in Lecture 5.\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n16\n\n\f0.1\n\n(b)\n\u03a9\u03bd h2\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n<m>max\n\u03b2\u03b2 (eV)\nFigure 8.

Another equivalent question is why the Coulomb\npotential in an atom is so much greater than the Newton potential: e2 \u226b GN m2 =\nm2 /m2P , where m is a typical particle mass?\nYour first thought might simply be to set mP \u226b mW by hand, and forget about\nthe problem. Life is not so simple, because quantum corrections to mH and hence\nmW are quadratically divergent in the Standard Model:\n\u03b1\n(54)\n\u03b4m2H,W \u2243 O( )\u039b2 ,\n\u03c0\nwhich is \u226b m2W if the cutoff \u039b, which represents the scale where new physics\nbeyond the Standard Model appears, is comparable to the GUT or Planck scale.\nFor example, if the Standard Model were to hold unscathed all the way up the\nPlanck mass mP \u223c 1019 GeV, the radiative correction (54) would be 36 orders of\nmagnitude greater than the physical values of m2H,W !\nIn principle, this is not a problem from the mathematical point of view of\nrenormalization theory. All one has to do is postulate a tree-level value of m2H that\nis (very nearly) equal and opposite to the 'correction' (54), and the correct physical\nvalue may be obtained by a delicate cancellation. However, this fine tuning strikes\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n17\n\n\fFigure 9. Possible measurements of \u03b813 and \u03b4 that could be made with a neutrino factory,\nusing a neutrino energy threshold of about 10 GeV. Using a single baseline correlations are very\nstrong, but can be largely reduced by combining information from different baselines and detector\ntechniques 40 , enabling the CP-violating phase \u03b4 to be extracted.\n\nmany physicists as rather unnatural: they would prefer a mechanism that keeps\nthe 'correction' (54) comparable at most to the physical value 51 .\nThis is possible in a supersymmetric theory, in which there are equal numbers\nof bosons and fermions with identical couplings. Since bosonic and fermionic loops\nhave opposite signs, the residual one-loop correction is of the form\n\u03b1\n(55)\n\u03b4m2H,W \u2243 O( )(m2B \u2212 m2F ),\n\u03c0\n2\nwhich is <\n\u223c mH,W and hence naturally small if the supersymmetric partner bosons\nB and fermions F have similar masses:\n2\n|m2B \u2212 m2F | <\n\u223c 1 TeV .\n\n(56)\n\nThis is the best motivation we have for finding supersymmetry at relatively low\nenergies 51 . In addition to this first supersymmetric miracle of removing (55)\nthe quadratic divergence (54), many logarithmic divergences are also absent in a\nsupersymmetric theory 52 , a property that also plays a r\u00f4le in the construction of\nsupersymmetric GUTs 14 .\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n18\n\n\fSeesaw mechanism\nM\u03bd\n\n9 effective parameters\n\nY\u03bd , MNi\n15+3 physical\nparameters\n\nLeptogenesis\nY\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020\n\n, MNi\n\n9+3 parameters\n\nRenormalization\nY\u03bd\u2020 LY\u03bd , MNi\n13+3 parameters\n\nFigure 10. Roadmap for the physical observables derived from Y\u03bd and Ni 50 .\n\nSupersymmetry had been around for some time before its utility for stabilizing the hierarchy of mass scales was realized. Some theorists had liked it because\nit offered the possibility of unifying fermionic matter particles with bosonic forcecarrying particles. Some had liked it because it reduced the number of infinities\nfound when calculating quantum corrections - indeed, theories with enough supersymmetry can even be completely finite 52 . Theorists also liked the possibility of\nunifying Higgs bosons with matter particles, though the first ideas for doing this\ndid not work out very well 53 . Another aspect of supersymmetry, that made some\ntheorists think that its appearance should be inevitable, was that it was the last\npossible symmetry of field theory not yet known to be exploited by Nature 54 . Yet\nanother asset was the observation that making supersymmetry a local symmetry,\nlike the Standard Model, necessarily introduced gravity, offering the prospect of\nunifying all the particle interactions. Moreover, supersymmetry seems to be an\nessential requirement for the consistency of string theory, which is the best candidate we have for a Theory of Everything, including gravity. However, none of\nthese 'beautiful' arguments gave a clue about the scale of supersymmetric particle\nmasses: this was first provided by the hierarchy argument outlined above.\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n19\n\n\fCould any of the known particles in the Standard Model be paired up in supermultiplets? Unfortunately, none of the known fermions q, l can be paired with any\nof the 'known' bosons \u03b3, W \u00b1 Z 0 , g, H, because their internal quantum numbers do\nnot match 53 . For example, quarks q sit in triplet representations of colour, whereas\nthe known bosons are either singlets or octets of colour. Then again, leptons l have\nnon-zero lepton number L = 1, whereas the known bosons have L = 0. Thus, the\nonly possibility seems to be to introduce new supersymmetric partners (spartners)\nfor all the known particles, as seen in the Table below: quark \u2192 squark, lepton\n\u2192 slepton, photon \u2192 photino, Z \u2192 Zino, W \u2192 Wino, gluon \u2192 gluino, Higgs \u2192\nHiggsino. The best that one can say for supersymmetry is that it economizes on\nprinciple, not on particles!\n\nParticle\n\nSpin\n\nSpartner\n\nSpin\n\nquark: q\n\n1\n2\n\nsquark: q\u0303\n\n0\n\nlepton: l\n\n1\n2\n\nslepton: l\u0303\n\n0\n\nphoton: \u03b3\n\n1\n\nphotino: \u03b3\u0303\n\n1\n2\n\nW\n\n1\n\nwino: W\u0303\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nzino: Z\u0303\n\n1\n2\n\nHiggs: H\n\n0\n\nhiggsino: H\u0303\n\n1\n2\n\nThe minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) 55 has\nthe same vector interactions as the Standard Model, and the particle masses arise\nin much the same way. However, in addition to the Standard Model particles and\ntheir supersymmetric partners in the Table, the minimal supersymmetric extension\nof the Standard Model (MSSM), requires two Higgs doublets H, H\u0304 with opposite\nhypercharges in order to give masses to all the matter fermions, whereas one Higgs\ndoublet would have sufficed in the Standard Model. The two Higgs doublets couple\nvia an extra coupling called \u03bc, and it should also be noted that the ratio of Higgs\nvacuum expectation values\ntan \u03b2 \u2261\n\nhH\u0304i\nhHi\n\n(57)\n\nis undetermined and should be treated as a free parameter.\n3.2\n\nHints of Supersymmetry\n\nThere are some phenomenological hints that supersymmetry may, indeed, appear at\nthe TeV scale. One is provided by the strengths of the different Standard Model in-\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n20\n\n\fFigure 11. The measurements of the gauge coupling strengths at LEP, including sin2 \u03b8W (29),\nevolve to a unified value if supersymmetry is included 56 .\n\nteractions, as measured at LEP 56 . These may be extrapolated to high energy\nscales including calculable renormalization effects 57 , to see whether they unify as\npredicted in a GUT. The answer is no, if supersymmetry is not included in the\ncalculations. In that case, GUTs would require a ratio of the electromagnetic and\nweak coupling strengths, parametrized by sin2 \u03b8W , different from what is observed\n(29), if they are to unify with the strong interactions. On the other hand, as seen in\nFig. 11, minimal supersymmetric GUTs predict just the correct ratio for the weak\nand electromagnetic interaction strengths, i.e., value for sin2 \u03b8W (29).\nA second hint is the fact that precision electroweak data prefer a relatively\nlight Higgs boson weighing less than about 200 GeV 6 . This is perfectly consistent\nwith calculations in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model\n(MSSM), in which the lightest Higgs boson weighs less than about 130 GeV 58 .\nA third hint is provided by the astrophysical necessity of cold dark matter. This\ncould be provided by a neutral, weakly-interacting particle weighing less than about\n1 TeV, such as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) \u03c7 59 . This is expected\nto be stable in the MSSM, and hence should be present in the Universe today as a\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n21\n\n\fcosmological relic from the Big Bang 60,59 . Its stability arises because there is a\nmultiplicatively-conserved quantum number called R parity, that takes the values\n+1 for all conventional particles and -1 for all sparticles 53 . The conservation of R\nparity can be related to that of baryon number B and lepton number L, since\nR = (\u22121)3B+L+2S\n\n(58)\n\nwhere S is the spin. There are three important consequences of R conservation:\n1. sparticles are always produced in pairs, e.g., p\u0304p \u2192 q\u0303g\u0303X, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc\u0303 + \u03bc\u0303\u2212 ,\n2. heavier sparticles decay to lighter ones, e.g., q\u0303 \u2192 qg\u0303, \u03bc\u0303 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u0303, and\n3. the lightest sparticle (LSP) is stable, because it has no legal decay mode.\nThis last feature constrains strongly the possible nature of the lightest supersymmetric sparticle 59 . If it had either electric charge or strong interactions, it\nwould surely have dissipated its energy and condensed into galactic disks along\nwith conventional matter. There it would surely have bound electromagnetically or\nvia the strong interactions to conventional nuclei, forming anomalous heavy isotopes\nthat should have been detected.\nA priori, the LSP might have been a sneutrino partner of one of the 3 light\nneutrinos, but this possibility has been excluded by a combination of the LEP\nneutrino counting and direct searches for cold dark matter. Thus, the LSP is often\nthought to be the lightest neutralino \u03c7 of spin 1/2, which naturally has a relic\ndensity of interest to astrophysicists and cosmologists: \u03a9\u03c7 h2 = O(0.1) 59 .\nFinally, a fourth hint may be coming from the measured value of the muon's\nanomalous magnetic moment, g\u03bc \u2212 2, which seems to differ slightly from the Standard Model prediction 61,62 . If there is indeed a significant discrepancy, this would\nrequire new physics at the TeV scale or below, which could easily be provided by\nsupersymmetry, as we see later.\n3.3\n\nConstraints on Supersymmetric Models\n\nImportant experimental constraints on supersymmetric models have been provided\nby the unsuccessful direct searches at LEP and the Tevatron collider. When compiling these, the supersymmetry-breaking masses of the different unseen scalar particles are often assumed to have a universal value m0 at some GUT input scale, and\nlikewise the fermionic partners of the vector bosons are also commonly assumed to\nhave universal fermionic masses m1/2 at the GUT scale - the so-called constrained\nMSSM or CMSSM.\nThe allowed domains in some of the (m1/2 , m0 ) planes for different values of\ntan \u03b2 and the sign of \u03bc are shown in Fig. 12. The various panels of this figure feature\n63\nthe limit m\u03c7\u00b1 >\n\u223c 104 GeV provided by chargino searches at LEP .

In the case of the t\u0303, LEP provides the most stringent\nlimit when mt\u0303 \u2212 m\u03c7 is small, and the Tevatron for larger mt\u0303 \u2212 m\u03c7 63 .\nAnother important constraint in Fig. 12 is provided by the LEP lower limit on\nthe Higgs mass: mH > 114.4 GeV 13 . Since mh is sensitive to sparticle masses,\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n23\n\n\fparticularly mt\u0303 , via loop corrections:\n\u03b4m2h\n\nm4\n\u221d 2t ln\nmW\n\nm2t\u0303\nm2t\n\n!\n\n+ ...\n\n(59)\n\nthe Higgs limit also imposes important constraints on the soft supersymmetrybreaking CMSSM parameters, principally m1/2 67 as displayed in Fig. 12.\nAlso shown in Fig. 12 is the constraint imposed by measurements of b \u2192 s\u03b3 66 .\nThese agree with the Standard Model, and therefore provide bounds on supersymmetric particles, such as the chargino and charged Higgs masses, in particular.\nThe final experimental constraint we consider is that due to the measurement of\nthe anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Following its first result last year 68 ,\nthe BNL E821 experiment has recently reported a new measurement 61 of a\u03bc \u2261\n1\n2 (g\u03bc \u2212 2), which deviates by about 2 standard deviations from the best available\nStandard Model predictions based on low-energy e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons data 62 . On the\nother hand, the discrepancy is more like 0.9 standard deviations if one uses \u03c4 \u2192\nhadrons data to calculate the Standard Model prediction. Faced with this confusion,\nand remembering the chequered history of previous theoretical calculations 69 , it\nis reasonable to defer judgement whether there is a significant discrepancy with\nthe Standard Model. However, either way, the measurement of a\u03bc is a significant\nconstraint on the CMSSM, favouring \u03bc > 0 in general, and a specific region of\nthe (m1/2 , m0 ) plane if one accepts the theoretical prediction based on e+ e\u2212 \u2192\nhadrons data 70 . The regions preferred by the current g \u2212 2 experimental data and\nthe e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons data are shown in Fig. 12.\nFig. 12 also displays the regions where the supersymmetric relic density \u03c1\u03c7 =\n\u03a9\u03c7 \u03c1critical falls within the range preferred by WMAP 20 :\n0.094 < \u03a9\u03c7 h2 < 0.129\n\n(60)\n\nat the 2-\u03c3 level. The upper limit on the relic density is rigorous, but the lower limit\nin (60) is optional, since there could be other important contributions to the overall\nmatter density. Smaller values of \u03a9\u03c7 h2 correspond to smaller values of (m1/2 , m0 ),\nin general.\nWe see in Fig. 12 that there are significant regions of the CMSSM parameter\nspace where the relic density falls within the preferred range (60). What goes\ninto the calculation of the relic density? It is controlled by the annihilation cross\nsection 59 :\n1\n,\n(61)\n\u03c1\u03c7 = m \u03c7 n \u03c7 , n \u03c7 \u223c\n\u03c3ann (\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 . . .)\nwhere the typical annihilation cross section \u03c3ann \u223c 1/m2\u03c7 . For this reason, the relic\ndensity typically increases with the relic mass, and this combined with the upper\nbound in (60) then leads to the common expectation that m\u03c7 <\n\u223c O(1) GeV.\nHowever, there are various ways in which the generic upper bound on m\u03c7 can\nbe increased along filaments in the (m1/2 , m0 ) plane. For example, if the nextto-lightest sparticle (NLSP) is not much heavier than \u03c7: \u2206m/m\u03c7 <\n\u223c 0.1, the relic\ndensity may be suppressed by coannihilation: \u03c3(\u03c7+NLSP\u2192 . . .) 71 . In this way,\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n24\n\n\fthe allowed CMSSM region may acquire a 'tail' extending to larger sparticle masses.\nAn example of this possibility is the case where the NLSP is the lighter stau: \u03c4\u03031\nand m\u03c4\u03031 \u223c m\u03c7 , as seen in Figs. 12(a) and (b) 72 .\nAnother mechanism for extending the allowed CMSSM region to large m\u03c7 is\nrapid annihilation via a direct-channel pole when m\u03c7 \u223c 12 mHiggs 73,74 . This may\nyield a 'funnel' extending to large m1/2 and m0 at large tan \u03b2, as seen in panels\n(c) and (d) of Fig. 12 74 . Yet another allowed region at large m1/2 and m0 is\nthe 'focus-point' region 75 , which is adjacent to the boundary of the region where\nelectroweak symmetry breaking is possible. The lightest supersymmetric particle\nis relatively light in this region.\n3.4\n\nBenchmark Supersymmetric Scenarios\n\nAs seen in Fig. 12, all the experimental, cosmological and theoretical constraints on\nthe MSSM are mutually compatible. As an aid to understanding better the physics\ncapabilities of the LHC and various other accelerators, as well as non-accelerator\nexperiments, a set of benchmark supersymmetric scenarios have been proposed 76 .\nTheir distribution in the (m1/2 , m0 ) plane is sketched in Fig. 13. These benchmark\nscenarios are compatible with all the accelerator constraints mentioned above, including the LEP searches and b \u2192 s\u03b3, and yield relic densities of LSPs in the range\nsuggested by cosmology and astrophysics. The benchmarks are not intended to\nsample 'fairly' the allowed parameter space, but rather to illustrate the range of\npossibilities currently allowed.\nIn addition to a number of benchmark points falling in the 'bulk' region of\nparameter space at relatively low values of the supersymmetric particle masses, as\nsee in Fig. 13, we also proposed 76 some points out along the 'tails' of parameter\nspace extending out to larger masses. These clearly require some degree of finetuning to obtain the required relic density 77 and/or the correct W \u00b1 mass 78 ,\nand some are also disfavoured by the supersymmetric interpretation of the g\u03bc \u2212 2\nanomaly, but all are logically consistent possibilities.\n3.5\n\nProspects for Discovering Supersymmetry at Accelerators\n\nIn the CMSSM discussed here, there are just a few prospects for discovering supersymmetry at the FNAL Tevatron collider 76 , but these could be increased in\nother supersymmetric models 79 . On the other hand, there are good prospects\nfor discovering supersymmetry at the LHC, and Fig. 14 shows its physics reach\nfor observing pairs of supersymmetric particles. The signature for supersymmetry\n- multiple jets (and/or leptons) with a large amount of missing energy - is quite\ndistinctive, as seen in Fig. 15 80,81 . Therefore, the detection of the supersymmetric partners of quarks and gluons at the LHC is expected to be quite easy if they\nweigh less than about 2.5 TeV 82 . Moreover, in many scenarios one should be able\nto observe their cascade decays into lighter supersymmetric particles. As seen in\nFig. 16, large fractions of the supersymmetric spectrum should be seen in most\nof the benchmark scenarios, although there are a couple where only the lightest\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n25\n\n\fFigure 13.

Note\nthat the filaments of the allowed parameter space extending to large m1/2 and/or m0 are sampled.\n\nsupersymmetric Higgs boson would be seen 76 , as seen in Fig. 16.\nElectron-positron colliders provide very clean experimental environments, with\negalitarian production of all the new particles that are kinematically accessible,\nincluding those that have only weak interactions, and hence are potentially complementary to the LHC, as illustrated in Fig. 16. Moreover, polarized beams provide a\nuseful analysis tool, and e\u03b3, \u03b3\u03b3 and e\u2212 e\u2212 colliders are readily available at relatively\nlow marginal costs. However, the direct production of supersymmetric particles at\nsuch a collider cannot be guaranteed 84 . We do not yet know what the supersymmetric threshold energy may be (or even if there is one!). We may well not know\nbefore the operation of the LHC, although g\u03bc \u2212 2 might provide an indication 70 ,\nif the uncertainties in the Standard Model calculation can be reduced. However, if\nan e+ e\u2212 collider is above the supersymmetric threshold, it will be able to measure\nvery accurately the sparticle masses. By combining its measurements with those\nmade at the LHC, it may be possible to calculate accurately from first principle\nthe supersymmetric relic density and compare it with the astrophysical value.\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n26\n\n\f1400\n\n\u222bL dt = 1, 10, 100, 300 fb-1\nA0= 0, tan\u03b2= 35, \u03bc > 0\n\n~\ng(300\n0)\n\nmiss\n\nET (300 fb-1)\n\nCMS\n\nmiss\n\nET\n\n1200\n\n)\n\nh(123\n\n(100 fb-1)\n\n~\ng(\n2500)\n\none year\n@10 34\nq~(2\n0\n\n~q(2\n\n00)\n\n0)\n\nTH\n\n50\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\n\n1000\n~\ng(2\n000)\n\nmiss\nET (10 fb-1)\n\n800\n\none year\n@10 33\n\n~\ng(1\n500)\n\n600\n\n~\ng(500\n)\n\none month\n@10 33\n\n~ 00)\ng(10\n\ncosmologically plausible\nregion\nFermilab reach: < 500 GeV\nDD_2101\n\n0)\n\nET (1 fb-1)\n\n)\n\nh(110)\n\n)\n\n00\n\nq~(5\n0\n\n200\n\nmiss\n\n00\n\n~q(10\n\n.15\n2 =0\n\u03a9h\n\none week\n@10 33\n\n2 1\n\u03a9h =\n\n2 0.4\n\u03a9h =\n\n400\n\nq~(\n15\n\nEX\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nm0 (GeV)\nCatania 18\n\nFigure 14.

Unfortunately,\nthe rates for their production are not very promising in the benchmark scenarios\nwe studied 86 .\n\u2022 Alternatively, one might look for annihilations in the core of our galaxy, which\nmight produce detectable gamma rays. As seen in the left panel of Fig. 17, this may\nbe possible in certain benchmark scenarios 86 , though the rate is rather uncertain\nbecause of the unknown enhancement of relic particles in our galactic core.\n\u2022 A third strategy is to look for annihilations inside the Sun or Earth, where\nthe local density of relic particles is enhanced in a calculable way by scattering off\nmatter, which causes them to lose energy and become gravitationally bound 87 . The\nsignature would then be energetic neutrinos that might produce detectable muons.\nSeveral underwater and ice experiments are underway or planned to look for this\nsignature, and this strategy looks promising for several benchmark scenarios, as\nseen in the right panel of Fig. 17 86 . It will be interesting to have such neutrino\ntelescopes in different hemispheres, which will be able to scan different regions of\nthe sky for astrophysical high-energy neutrino sources.\n\u2022 The most satisfactory way to look for supersymmetric relic particles is directly\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n28\n\n\fNb. of Observable Particles\n\n40\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\nGB L C J I ME H A F K D\n\n0\n\n40\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\nGB L C J I ME H A F K D\n\n0\n\n40\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\nGB L C J I ME H A F K D\n\n0\n\nGB L C J I ME H A F K D\n\nGB L C J I ME H A F K D\n\nGB L C J I ME H A F K D\n\nFigure 16.

So how did\nopposite parts of the Universe, 180 degrees apart, 'know' how to coordinate their\ntemperatures and densities?\nAnother problem of conventional Big bang cosmology is the size or age problem.\nThe Hubble expansion rate in conventional Big bang cosmology is given by:\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0227\n8\u03c0GN \u03c1\nk\n2\nH \u2261\n=\n(63)\n\u2212 2,\na\n3\na\nwhere k = 0 or \u00b11 is the curvature. The only dimensionful coefficient in (63) is\nthe Newton constant, GN \u2261 1/MP2 : MP \u2243 1.2 \u00d7 1019 GeV. A generic solution of\n(63) would have a characteristic scale size a \u223c lP \u2261 1/MP \u223c 10\u221233 s and live to\nthe ripe old age of t \u223c tP \u2261 lP /c \u2243 10\u221243 s. Why is our Universe so long-lived and\nbig? Clearly, we live in an atypical solution of (63)!\nA related issue is the flatness problem.

A 'typical' Universe would have contained O(1) particles in\nits size \u223c l3P .\nAll these particles have diluted what might have been the primordial density of\nunwanted massive particles such as magnetic monopoles and gravitinos. Where did\nthey go?\nThe basic idea of inflation 96 is that, at some early epoch in the history of the\nUniverse, its energy density may have been dominated by an almost constant term:\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0227\n8\u03c0GN \u03c1\nk\n(66)\n=\n\u2212 2 : \u03c1 = V,\na\n3\na\nleading to a phase of almost de Sitter expansion.

This would have enabled initial homogeneity to have been established.\nThe trick is not somehow to impose connections beyond the horizon, but rather\nto make the horizon much larger than naively expected in conventional Big Bang\ncosmology:\naH \u2243 aI eH\u03c4 \u226b c\u03c4,\n\n(68)\n\nwhere H\u03c4 is the number of e-foldings during inflation. It is also apparent that\nthe \u2212 ak2 term in (66) becomes negligible, so that the Universe is almost flat with\n\u03a9tot \u2243 1. However, as we see later, perturbations during inflation generate a small\ndeviation from unity: |\u03a9tot \u2212 1| \u2243 10\u22125 . Following inflation, the conversion of\nthe inflationary vacuum energy into particles reheats the Universe, filling it with\nthe required entropy. Finally, the closest pre-inflationary monopole or gravitino is\npushed away, further than the origin of the CMB, by the exponential expansion of\nthe Universe.\nFrom the point of view of general relativity, the (near-) constant inflationary\nvacuum energy is equivalent to a cosmological constant \u039b:\n1\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R = 8\u03c0GN T\u03bc\u03bd + \u039bg\u03bc\u03bd .\n2\n\n(69)\n\nWe may compare the right-hand side of (69) with the energy-momentum tensor of\na standard fluid:\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212pg\u03bc\u03bd + (\u03c1 + p)U\u03bc U\u03bd\n\n(70)\n\nwhere U\u03bc = (1, 0, 0, 0) is the four-momentum vector for a comoving fluid. We can\ntherefore write\n1\n\u039b\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R = 8\u03c0GN T\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n2\n\n(71)\n\nwhere\n\u03c1\u039b \u2261\n\n\u039b\n\u2261 \u2212p\u039b .\n8\u03c0GN\n\n(72)\n\nThus, we see that inflation has negative pressure. The value of the cosmological\nconstant today, as suggested by recent observations 97,98, is many orders of magnitude smaller than would have been required during inflation: \u03c1\u039b \u223c 10\u221250 GeV4\ncompared with the density V \u223c 10+65 GeV4 required during inflation, as we see\nlater.\nSuch a small value of the cosmological energy density is also much smaller than\nmany contributions to it from identifiable physics sources: \u03c1(QCD) \u223c 10\u22124 GeV4 ,\n\u03c1(Electroweak) \u223c 109 GeV4 , \u03c1(GU T ) \u223c 1064 (?) GeV4 and \u03c1(QuantumGravity) \u223c\n1074 (?) GeV4 . Particle physics offers no reason to expect the present-day vacuum\nenergy to lie within the range suggested by cosmology, and raises the question why\nit is not many orders of magnitude larger.\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n32\n\n\f4.2\n\nSome Inflationary Models\n\nThe first inflationary potential V to be proposed was one with a 'double-dip' structure \u00e0 la Higgs 96 . The old inflation idea was that the Universe would have started\nin the false vacuum with V 6= 0, where it would have undergone many e-foldings of\nde Sitter expansion. Then, the Universe was supposed to have tunnelled through\nthe potential barrier to the true vacuum with V \u2243 0, and subsequently thermalized.\nThe inflation required before this tunnelling was\nr\n\u039b\n, \u039b = 8\u03c0GN V.\n(73)\nH\u03c4 >\n\u223c 60 : H =\n3\nThe problem with this old inflationary scenario was that the phase transition to\nthe new vacuum would never have been completed. The Universe would look like a\n'Swiss cheese' in which the bubbles of true vacuum would be expanding as t1/2 or\nt2/3 , while the 'cheese' between them would still have been expanding exponentially\nas eHt . Thus, the fraction of space in the false vacuum would be\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n4\u03c0 \u0393\n,\n(74)\nf \u223c exp Ht 3 \u2212\n3 H4\n\nwhere \u0393 is the bubble nucleation rate per unit four-volume. The fraction f \u2192 0\nonly if \u0393/H 4 \u2243 O(1), but in this case there would not have been sufficient e-foldings\nfor adequate inflation.\nOne of the fixes for this problem trades under the name of new inflation 99 . The\nidea is that the near-exponential expansion of the Universe took place in a flat region\nof the potential V (\u03c6) that is not separated from the true vacuum by any barrier.\nIt might have been reached after a first-order transition of the type postulated in\nold inflation, in which case one can regard our Universe as part of a bubble that\nexpanded near-exponentially inside the 'cheese' of old vacuum, and there could be\nregions beyond our bubble that are still expanding (near-) exponentially. For the\nUniverse to roll eventually downhill into the true vacuum, V (\u03c6) could not quite\nbe constant, and hence the Hubble expansion rate H during inflation was also not\nconstant during new inflation.\nAn example of such a scenario is chaotic inflation 100 , according to which there\nis no 'bump' in the effective potential V (\u03c6), and hence no phase transition between\nold and new vacua. Instead, any given region of the Universe is assumed to start\nwith some random value of the inflaton field \u03c6 and hence the potential V (\u03c6), which\ndecreases monotonically to zero. If the initial value of V (\u03c6) is large enough, and the\npotential flat enough, (our part of) the Universe will undergo sufficient expansion.\nAnother fix for old inflation trades under the name of extended inflation 101 .\nHere the idea is that the tunnelling rate \u0393 depends on some other scalar field \u03c7\nthat varies while the inflaton \u03c6 is still stuck in the old vacuum. If \u0393(\u03c7) is initially\nsmall, but \u03c7 then changes so that \u0393(\u03c7) becomes large, the problem of completing\nthe transition in the 'Swiss cheese' Universe is solved.\nAll these variants of inflation rely on some type of elementary scalar inflaton\nfield. Therefore, the discovery of a Higgs boson would be a psychological boost for\ninflation, even though the electroweak Higgs boson cannot be responsible for it directly. Moreover, just as supersymmetry is well suited for stabilizing the mass scale\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n33\n\n\fof the electroweak Higgs boson, it may also be needed to keep the inflationary potential under control 102 . Later in this Lecture, I discuss a specific supersymmetric\ninflationary model.\n4.3\n\nDensity Perturbations\n\nThe above description is quite classical. In fact, one should expect quantum fluctuations in the initial value of the inflaton field \u03c6, which would cause the roll-over\ninto the true vacuum to take place inhomogeneously, and different parts of the\nUniverse to expand differently. As we discuss below in more detail, these quantum fluctuations would give rise to a Gaussian random field of perturbations with\nsimilar magnitudes on different scale sizes, just as the astrophysicists have long\nwanted. The magnitudes of these perturbations would be linked to the value of the\neffective potential during inflation, and would be visible in the CMB as adiabatic\ntemperature fluctuations:\n\u03b4T\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u223c\n\u223c \u03bc2 GN ,\nT\n\u03c1\n\n(75)\n\nwhere \u03bc \u2261 V 1/4 is a typical vacuum energy scale during inflation. As we discuss\nlater in more detail, consistency with the CMB data from COBE et al., that find\n\u03b4T /T \u2243 10\u22125 , is obtained if\n\u03bc \u2243 1016 GeV,\n\n(76)\n\ncomparable with the GUT scale.\nEach density perturbation can be regarded as an embryonic potential well, into\nwhich non-relativistic cold dark matter particles may fall, increasing the local contrast in the mass-energy density. On the other hand, relativistic hot dark matter\nparticles will escape from small-scale density perturbations, modifying their rate of\ngrowth. This also depends on the expansion rate of the Universe and hence the\ncosmological constant. Present-day data are able to distinguish the effects of different categories of dark matter. In particular, as we already discussed, the WMAP\nand other data tell us that the density of hot dark matter neutrinos is relatively\nsmall 20 :\n\u03a9\u03bd h2 < 0.0076,\n\n(77)\n\nwhereas the density of cold dark matter is relatively large 20 :\n\u03a9CDM h2 = 0.1126+0.0081\n\u22120.0091 ,\n\n(78)\n\nand the cosmological constant is even larger: \u03a9\u039b \u2243 0.73.\nThe cold dark matter amplifies primordial perturbations already while the conventional baryonic matter is coupled to radiation before (re)combination. Once\nthis epoch is passed and the CMB decouples from the conventional baryonic matter, the baryons become free to fall into the 'holes' prepared for them by the cold\ndark matter that has fallen into the overdense primordial perturbations. In this\nway, structures in the Universe, such as galaxies and their clusters, may be formed\nearlier than they would have appeared in the absence of cold dark matter.\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n34\n\n\fAll this theory is predicated on the presence of primordial perturbations laid\ndown by inflation 103 , which we now explore in more detail.\nThere are in fact two types of perturbations, namely density fluctuations and\ngravity waves. To describe the first, we consider the density field \u03c1(x) and its\nperturbations \u03b4(x) \u2261 (\u03c1(x)\u2212 < \u03c1 >)/ < \u03c1 >, which we can decompose into Fourier\nmodes:\nZ\n\u03b4(x) =\nd3 x\u03b4k e\u2212ik*x .\n(79)\nThe density perturbation on a given scale \u03bb is then given by\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0013\n\u0012 3\n\u03b4\u03c1\nk |\u03b4k |2\n,\n=\n\u03c1 \u03bb\n2\u03c0 2\nk\u22121 =\u03bb\n\n(80)\n\nwhose evolution depends on the ratio \u03bb/aH , where aH \u2261 c * t is the naive horizon\nsize.\nThe evolution of small-scale perturbations with \u03bb/aH < 1 depends on the astrophysical dynamics, such as the quation of state, dissipation, the Jeans instability,\netc.:\nk2\n(81)\n\u03b4\u0308k + 2H \u03b4\u0307k + vs2 2 \u03b4k = 4\u03c0GN < \u03c1 > \u03b4k ,\na\nwhere vs is the sound speed: vs2 = dp/d\u03c1. If the wave number k is larger than the\ncharacteristic Jeans value\ns\n4\u03c0GN a2 < \u03c1 >\n,\n(82)\nkJ =\nvs2\nthe density perturbation \u03b4k oscillates, whereas it grows if k < kJ . Cold dark matter\neffectively provides vs \u2192 0, in which case kJ \u2192 \u221e and perturbations with all wave\nnumbers grow.\nIn order to describe the evolution of large-scale perturbations with \u03bb/aH > 1, we\nuse the gauge-invariant ratio \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 + p, which remains constant outside the horizon\naH . Hence, the value when such a density perturbation comes back within the\nhorizon is identical with its value when it was inflated beyond the horizon. During\ninflation, one had \u03c1 + p \u2243< \u03c6\u03072 >, and\n\u03b4\u03c1 = \u03b4\u03c6 \u00d7\n\n\u2202V\n= \u03b4\u03c6 \u00d7 V \u2032 (\u03c6).\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(83)\n\nDuring roll-over, one has \u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + V \u2032 (\u03c6) = 0, and, if the roll-over is slow, one has\n\u03c6\u0307 \u2243 \u2212\n\nV \u2032 (\u03c6)\n,\n3H\n\nwhere the Hubble expansion rate\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 2\n8\u03c0GN\n8\u03c0\n2\n\u2243\nGN V (\u03c6) + \u03c6\u0307\nV (\u03c6).\nH =\n3\n2\n3\n\n(84)\n\n(85)\n\nThe quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field in de Sitter space are given by:\n\u03b4\u03c6 \u2243\n\nH\n,\n2\u03c0\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n(86)\n\n35\n\n\fso initially\n\u03b4\u03c1\nH3 * V \u2032\nV 3/2\n\u03b4\u03c6 * V \u2032\n\u2243\n\u2243\n.\n\u2243\n\u03c1+p\n\u03c6.2\n(V \u2032 )2\nV\u2032\n\n(87)\n\nThis is therefore also the value when the perturbation comes back within the horizon:\n\u221a 2 2\n\u0012 \u0013\n2\u03ba H\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2261 AS (\u03c6) =\n: \u03ba2 \u2261 8\u03c0GN ,\n(88)\n\u03c1 \u03bb=aH\n8\u03c0 3/2 |H \u2032 |\nassuming that \u03c1 \u226b p at this epoch.\nGravity-wave perturbations obey an equation analogous to (81):\n1,2\n2\n\u1e271,2\nk + 2H \u1e23k + vs\n\nk 2 1,2\nh\n= 0,\na2 k\n\n(89)\n\nfor each of the two graviton polarization states h1,2\n\u03bc\u03bd , where\nF RW\ng\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd\n+ h\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(90)\n\nThe h1,2\nk also remain unchanged outside the horizon aH , and have initial values\nh1,2\n\u2243\nk\n\nH\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n(91)\n\nyielding\n3\n\nk |hk |\u03bb=aH\n\n\u03ba\nH: H \u2243\n\u2261 AT (\u03c6) =\n4\u03c0 3/2\n\nr\n\n8\u03c0GN\nV.\n3\n\n(92)\n\nComparing (88, 92), we see that\nr \u2261\n\nAS (\u03c6)\n\u03ba H\n= \u221a\n: \u03ba2 = 8\u03c0GN .\nAT (\u03c6)\n2 |H \u2032 |\n\n(93)\n\nHence, if the roll-over is very slow, so that |H \u2032 | is very small, the density waves\ndominate over the tensor gravity waves.

It predicts the\nfollowing values for the primary CMB observables 105 : the scalar spectral index\nns = 1 \u2212\n\n8MP2\n\u2243 0.96,\n\u03c62I\n\n(116)\n\nthe tensor-to scalar ratio\nr =\n\n32MP2\n\u2243 0.16,\n\u03c62I\n\n(117)\n\nand the running parameter for the scalar spectral index:\n32MP4\ndns\n=\n\u2243 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\ndlnk\n\u03c64I\n\n(118)\n\nThe value of ns extracted from WMAP data depends whether, for example, one\ncombines them with other CMB and/or large-scale structure data. However, the\n\u03c62 model value ns \u2243 0.96 appears to be compatible with the data at the 1-\u03c3 level.\nThe \u03c62 model value r \u2243 0.16 for the relative tensor strength is also compatible with\nthe WMAP data. In fact, we note that the favoured individual values for ns , r and\ndns /dlnk reported in an independent analysis 106 all coincide with the \u03c62 model\nvalues, within the latter's errors!\nOne of the most interesting features of the WMAP analysis is the possibility that\ndns /dlnk might differ from zero. The \u03c62 model value dns /dlnk \u2243 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 derived\nabove is negligible compared with the WMAP preferred value and its uncertainties.\nHowever, dns /dlnk = 0 appears to be compatible with the WMAP analysis at the\n2-\u03c3 level or better, so we do not regard this as a death-knell for the \u03c62 model.\n4.5\n\nCould the Inflaton be a Sneutrino?\n\nThis 'old' idea 107 has recently been resurrected 105 . We recall that seesaw models 25 of neutrino masses involve three heavy singlet right-handed neutrinos weighing around 1010 to 1015 GeV, which certainly includes the preferred inflaton mass\nfound above (115). Moreover, supersymmetry requires each of the heavy neutrinos\nto be accompanied by scalar sneutrino partners. In addition, singlet (s)neutrinos\nhave no interactions with vector bosons, so their effective potential may be as flat as\none could wish. Moreover, supersymmetry safeguards the flatness of this potential\nagainst radiative corrections. Thus, singlet sneutrinos have no problem in meeting\nthe slow-roll requirements of inflation.\nOn the other hand, their Yukawa interactions YD are eminently suitable for\nconverting the inflaton energy density into particles via N \u2192 H + l decays and\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n39\n\n\f1014\nA\n\nM1 in GeV\n\n1012\n\n1010\n\n108\n\nC\n\n106\n\nB\n\n108\n\n1010 1012\nTRH in GeV\n\n1014\n\nFigure 19.

In the area bounded by the red dashed curve leptogenesis is entirely thermal 105 .\n1\n\ntheir supersymmetric variants. Since the magnitudes of these Yukawa interactions\nare not completely determined, there is flexibility in the reheating temperature after\ninflation, as we see in Fig. 19 105 . Thus the answer to the question in the title of\nthis Section seems to be 'yes', so far.\n5\n\nFurther Beyond\n\nSome key cosmological and astrophysical problems may be resolved only by appeal to particle physics beyond the ideas we have discussed so far. One of the\ngreatest successes of Big Bang cosmology has been an explanation of the observed\nabundances of light elements, ascribed to cosmological nucleosynthesis when the\ntemperature T \u223c 1 to 0.1 MeV. This requires a small baryon-to-entropy ratio\nnB /s \u2243 10\u221210 . How did this small baryon density originate?\nLooking back to the previous quark epoch, there must have been a small excess\nof quarks over antiquarks. All the antiquarks would then have annihilated with\nquarks when the temperature of the Universe was \u223c 200 MeV, producing radiation\nand leaving the small excess of quarks to survive to form baryons. So how did the\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n40\n\n\fsmall excess of quarks originate?\nSakharov 108 pointed out that microphysics, in the form of particle interactions, could generate a small excess of quarks if the following three conditions were\nsatisfied:\n\u2022 The interactions of matter and antimatter particles should differ, in the sense\nthat both charge conjugation C and its combination CP with mirror reflection\nshould be broken, as discovered in the weak interactions.\n\u2022 There should exist interactions capable of changing the net quark number. Such\ninteractions do exist in the Standard Model, mediated by unstable field configurations called sphalerons. They have not been observed at low temperatures, where\nthey would be mediated by heavy states called sphalerons and are expected to be\nvery weak, but they are thought to have been important when the temperature\nof the Universe was >\n\u223c 100 GeV. Alternatively, one may appeal to interactions in\nGrand Unified Theories (GUTs) that are thought to change quarks into leptons\nand vice versa when their energies \u223c 1015 GeV.\n\u2022 There should have been a breakdown of thermal equilibrium. This could have\noccurred during a phase transition in the early Universe, for example during the\nelectroweak phase transition when T \u223c 100 GeV, during inflation, or during a GUT\nphase transition when T \u223c 1015 GeV.\nThe great hope in the business of cosmological baryogenesis is to find a connection with physics accessible to accelerator experiments, and some examples will be\nmentioned later in this Lecture.\nAnother example of observable phenomena related to GUT physics may be\n11\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) 109, which have energies >\n\u223c 10 GeV.\nThe UHECRs might either have originated from some astrophysical source, such\nas an active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or gamma-ray bursters (GRBs), or they might\nbe due to the decays of metastable GUT-scale particles, a possibility discussed in\nthe last part of this Lecture.\n5.1\n\nGrand Unified Theories\n\nThe philosophy of grand unification 110 is to seek a simple group that includes\nthe untidy separate interactions of the Standard Model, QCD and the electroweak\nsector. The hope is that this Grand Unification can be achieved while neglecting\ngravity, at least as a first approximation. If the grand unification scale turns out to\nbe significantly less than the Planck mass, this is not obviously a false hope.

Indeed, baryon decay is a generic prediction of\nGUTs, which we illustrate with the simplest SU(5) model. We see in (125) that\nthere are two species of vector bosons in SU(5) that couple the colour indices\n(1,2,3) to the electroweak indices (4,5), called X and Y . As we can see from the\nmatter representations (126), these may enable two quarks or a quark and lepton\nto annihilate. Combining these possibilities leads to interactions with \u2206B = \u2206L =\n1. The forms of effective four-fermion interactions mediated by the exchanges of\nmassive Z and Y bosons, respectively, are 113 :\n\u01ebijk uRk \u03b3\u03bc uLj\n\u01ebijk uRk \u03b3\u03bc dLj\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n2\ngX\n8m2X\n\n(2eR \u03b3 \u03bc dLi + eL \u03b3 \u03bc dRi ) ,\n\ngY2\n8m2X\n\n(\u03bdL \u03b3 \u03bc dRi ) ,\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n(127)\n\n43\n\n\fup to generation mixing factors.\nSince the couplings gX = gY in an SU(5) GUT, and mX \u2243 mY , we expect that\nGX \u2261\n\n2\ng2\ngX\n\u2243 GY \u2261 Y2 .\n2\n8mX\n8mY\n\n(128)\n\nIt is clear from (127) that the baryon decay amplitude A \u221d GX , and hence the\nbaryon B \u2192 l+ meson decay rate\n\u0393B = cG2X m5p ,\n\n(129)\n\nwhere the factor of m5p comes from dimensional analysis, and c is a coefficient that\ndepends on the GUT model and the non-perturbative properties of the baryon and\nmeson.\nThe decay rate (129) corresponds to a proton lifetime\n\u03c4p =\n\n1 m4X\n.\nc m5p\n\n(130)\n\nIt is clear from (130) that the proton lifetime is very sensitive to mX , which must\ntherefore be calculated very precisely.

Making an analysis of the generation\nmixing factors 112 , one finds that the preferred proton (and bound neutron) decay\nmodes in minimal SU(5) are\np \u2192 e+ \u03c0 0 , e+ \u03c9 , \u03bd\u0304\u03c0 + , \u03bc+ K 0 , . . .\nn \u2192 e+ \u03c0 \u2212 , e+ \u03c1\u2212 , \u03bd\u0304\u03c0 0 , . . .\nand the best numerical estimate of the lifetime is\n\u0012\n\u00134\n\u039bQCD\n+ 0\n31\u00b11\n\u03c4 (p \u2192 e \u03c0 ) \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\n\u00d7\ny\n400 MeV\n\n(132)\n\n(133)\n\nThis is in prima facie conflict with the latest experimental lower limit\n\u03c4 (p \u2192 e+ \u03c0 0 ) > 1.6 \u00d7 1033 y\n\n(134)\n\nmX \u2243 1016 GeV,\n\n(135)\n\nfrom super-Kamiokande 114 .\nWe saw earlier that supersymmetric GUTs, including SU(5), fare better with\ncoupling unification. They also predict a larger GUT scale 111 :\n\nso that \u03c4 (p \u2192 e+ \u03c0 0 ) is considerably longer than the experimental lower limit.\nHowever, this is not the dominant proton decay mode in supersymmetric SU(5) 115 .\nIn this model, there are important \u2206B = \u2206L = 1 interactions mediated by the\nexchange of colour-triplet Higgsinos H\u03033 , dressed by gaugino exchange 116 :\n\u0012 2 2\u0013\n1\n\u03bb g\n(136)\nGX \u2192 O\n16\u03c0 2\nmH\u03033 m\u0303\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n44\n\n\fwhere \u03bb is a Yukawa coupling. Taking into account colour factors and the increase\nin \u03bb for more massive particles, it was found 115 that decays into neutrinos and\nstrange particles should dominate:\np \u2192 \u03bd\u0304K + , n \u2192 \u03bd\u0304K 0 , . . .\n\n(137)\n\nBecause there is only one factor of a heavy mass mH\u03033 in the denominator of (136),\nthese decay modes are expected to dominate over p \u2192 e+ \u03c0 0 , etc., in minimal\nsupersymmetric SU(5). Calculating carefully the other factors in (136) 115 , it\nseems that the modes (137) may now be close to exclusion at rates compatible\nwith this model. The current experimental limit is \u03c4 (p \u2192 \u03bd\u0304K + ) > 6.7 \u00d7 1032 y.\nHowever, there are other GUT models 28 that remain compatible with the baryon\ndecay limits.\nThe presence of baryon-number-violating interactions opens the way to cosmological baryogenesis via the out-of-equilibrium decays of GUT bosons 117 :\nX \u2192 q + l\u0304 vs X\u0304 \u2192 q\u0304 + l.\n\n(138)\n\nIn the presence of C and CP violation, the branching ratios for X \u2192 q + l\u0304 and\nX\u0304 \u2192 q\u0304 + l may differ. Such a difference may in principle be generated by quantum\n(loop) corrections to the leading-order interactions of GUT bosons. This effect is\ntoo small in the minimal SU(5) GUT described above 118 , but could be larger\nin some more complicated GUT. One snag is that, with GUT bosons as heavy\nas suggested above, the CP-violating decay asymmetry may tend to get washed\nout by thermal effects. This difficulty may in principle be avoided by appealing\nto the decays of GUT Higgs bosons, which might weigh \u226a 1015 GeV, though this\npossibility is not strongly motivated.\nAlthough neutrino masses might arise without a GUT framework, they appear\nvery naturally in most GUTs, and this framework helps motivated the mass scale\n\u223c 1010 to 1015 GeV required for the heavy singlet neutrinos. Their decays provide\nan alternative mechanism for generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe,\nnamely leptogenesis 49 . In the presence of C and CP violation, the branching\nratios for N \u2192 Higgs + l may differ from that for N \u2192 Higgs + l\u0304, producing\na net lepton asymmetry. The likely masses for heavy singlet neutrinos could be\nsignificantly lower than the GUT scale, so it may be easier to avoid thermal washout\neffects. However, you may ask what is the point of generating a lepton asymmetry,\nsince we want a quark asymmetry? The answer is provided by the weak sphaleron\ninteractions that are present in the Standard Model, and would have converted part\nof the lepton asymmetry into the desired quark asymmetry. We now discuss how\nthis scenario might have operated in the minimal seesaw model for neutrino masses\ndiscussed in Lecture 2.\n5.3\n\nLeptogenesis in the Seesaw Model\n\nAs mentioned in the second Lecture, the minimal seesaw neutrino model contains 18\nparameters 44 , of which only 9 are observable in low-energy neutrino interactions:\n3 light neutrino masses, 3 real mixing angles \u03b812,23,31 , the oscillation phase \u03b4 and\nthe 2 Majorana phases \u03c61,2 .\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n45\n\n\fTo see how the extra 9 parameters appear 45 , we reconsider the full lepton\nsector, assuming that we have diagonalized the charged-lepton mass matrix:\n(Yl )ij = Yldi \u03b4ij ,\n\n(139)\n\nas well as that of the heavy singlet neutrinos:\nMij = Mid \u03b4ij .\n\n(140)\n\nWe can then parametrize the neutrino Dirac coupling matrix Y\u03bd in terms of its real\nand diagonal eigenvalues and unitary rotation matrices:\nY\u03bd = Z \u2217 Y\u03bddk X \u2020 ,\n\n(141)\n\nwhere X has 3 mixing angles and one CP-violating phase, just like the CKM matrix,\nand we can write Z in the form\nZ = P1 Z\u0304P2 ,\n\n(142)\n\nwhere Z\u0304 also resembles the CKM matrix, with 3 mixing angles and one CP-violating\nphase, and the diagonal matrices P1,2 each have two CP-violating phases:\n\u0001\n(143)\nP1,2 = Diag ei\u03b81,3 , ei\u03b82,4 , 1 .\n\nIn this parametrization, we see explicitly that the neutrino sector has 18 parameters 44 : the 3 heavy-neutrino mass eigenvalues Mid , the 3 real eigenvalues of Y\u03bdDi ,\nthe 6 = 3 + 3 real mixing angles in X and Z\u0304, and the 6 = 1 + 5 CP-violating phases\nin X and Z\u0304 45 .\nThe total decay rate of a heavy neutrino Ni may be written in the form\n\u0001\n1\n\u0393i =\n(144)\nY\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 ii Mi .\n8\u03c0\nOne-loop CP-violating diagrams involving the exchange of heavy neutrino Nj would\ngenerate an asymmetry in Ni decay of the form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0001 \u00112\nMj\n1\n1\n\u0010\n\u0011 Im Y\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 ij f\n\u01ebij =\n,\n(145)\n8\u03c0 Y\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020\nMi\nii\n\nwhere f (Mj /Mi ) is a known kinematic function.\nThus we see that leptogenesis 49 is proportional to the product\n\u00012\nY\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 = P1\u2217 Z\u0304 \u2217 Y\u03bdd Z\u0304 T P1 ,\n\n(146)\n\nwhich depends on 13 of the real parameters and 3 CP-violating phases. As mentioned in Lecture 2, the extra seesaw parameters also contribute to the renormalization of soft supersymmetry-breaking masses, in leading order via the combination\n\u00012\n(147)\nY\u03bd\u2020 Y\u03bd = X Y\u03bdd X \u2020 ,\n\nwhich depends on just 1 CP-violating phase, with two more phases appearing in\nhigher orders, when one allows the heavy singlet neutrinos to be non-degenerate 47 .\nIn order to see how the low-energy sector is embedded in the full parametrization\nof the seesaw model, and hence its (lack of) relation to leptogenesis 50 , we first recall\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n46\n\n\fthat the 3 phases in P\u03032 (46) become observable when one also considers high-energy\nquantities. Next, we introduce a complex orthogonal matrix\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(148)\nR \u2261 M d Y\u03bd U M d [v sin \u03b2] ,\nwhich has 3 real mixing angles and 3 phases: RT R = 1. These 6 additional parameters may be used to characterize Y\u03bd , by inverting\n\u221a\n\u221a\nM dR M dU \u2020\nY\u03bd =\n,\n(149)\n[v sin \u03b2]\n\ngiving us the grand total of 18 = 9 + 3 + 6 parameters 45 . The leptogenesis\nobservable (146) may now be written in the form\n\u221a\n\u221a\nM d RMd\u03bd R\u2020 M d\n\u2020\n\u0002\n\u0003\nY\u03bd Y\u03bd =\n,\n(150)\nv 2 sin2 \u03b2\n\nwhich depends on the 3 phases in R, but not the 3 low-energy phases \u03b4, \u03c61,2 , nor\nthe 3 real MNS mixing angles 45 !\nThe basic reason for this is that one makes a unitary sum over all the light lepton\nspecies in evaluating the asymmetry \u01ebij . It is easy to derive a compact expression\nfor \u01ebij in terms of the heavy neutrino masses and the complex orthogonal matrix\nR:\n\u0010\n\u0001 \u00112\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd \u2020\n1\nMj Im RM\u03bd R ij\n\u01ebij =\nMj f\n,\n(151)\n8\u03c0\nMi\n(RMd\u03bd R\u2020 )ii\nwhich depends explicitly on the extra phases in R. How can we measure them?\nIn general, one may formulate the following strategy for calculating leptogenesis\nin terms of laboratory observables 45,50 :\n\u2022 Measure the neutrino oscillation phase \u03b4 and the Majorana phases \u03c61,2 ,\n\u2022 Measure observables related to the renormalization of soft supersymmetrybreaking parameters, that are functions of \u03b4, \u03c61,2 and the leptogenesis phases,\n\u2022 Extract the effects of the known values of \u03b4 and \u03c61,2 , and isolate the leptogenesis parameters.\nIn the absence of complete information on the first two steps above, we are currently at the stage of preliminary explorations of the multi-dimensional parameter\nspace. As seen in Fig. 20, the amount of the leptogenesis asymmetry is explicitly\nindependent of \u03b4 50 . However, in order to make more definite predictions, one must\nmake extra hypotheses.\nOne possibility is that the inflaton might be a heavy singlet sneutrino, as discussed in the previous Lecture 105 . As shown there, this hypothesis would require\na mass \u2243 1.8 \u00d7 1013 GeV for the lightest sneutrino, which is well within the range\nfavoured by seesaw models. As also discussed in the previous Lecture, this sneutrino inflaton model predicts values of the spectral index of scalar perturbations,\nthe fraction of tensor perturbations and other CMB observables that are consistent\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n47\n\n\f\u03b51\n\n\u03b51\n\nMN1 [GeV]\n\nMN1 [GeV]\n\nFigure 20.

They are indistinguishable.\n\nwith the WMAP data. The sneutrino inflaton model is quite compatible with a low\nreheating temperature, as seen in Fig. 19. Moreover, because of this and the other\nconstraints on the seesaw model parameters in this model, it makes predictions for\nthe branching ratio for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 that are more precise than in the generic seesaw\nmodel. As seen in Fig. 21, it predicts that this decay should appear within a couple\nof orders of magnitude of the present experimental upper limit 105 .\n\n5.4\n\nUltra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays\n\nThe flux of cosmic rays falls approximately as E \u22123 from E \u223c 1 GeV, through E \u223c\n106 GeV where there is a small change in slope called the 'knee', continuing to about\n1010 GeV, the 'ankle'. Beyond about 5 \u00d7 1010 GeV, as seen in Fig. 22, one expects a\ncutoff 119 due to the photopion reaction p + \u03b3CMB \u2192 \u2206+ \u2192 p + \u03c0\u0304 0 , n + \u03c0 + , for all\nprimary cosmic rays that originate from more than about 50 Mpc away. However,\nsome experiments report cosmic-ray events with higher energies of 1011 GeV or\nmore 109 . If this excess flux beyond the GKZ cutoff is confirmed, conventional\nphysics would require it to originate from distances <\n\u223c 100 Mpc, in which case\none would expect to see some discrete sources. Analogous cutoffs are expected for\nprimary cosmic-ray photons or nuclei, as also seen in Fig. 22.\nThere are two general categories of sources considered for such ultra-high-energy\ncosmic rays (UHECRs): bottom-up and top-down scenarios 109 .\nAstrophysical sources capable of accelerating high-energy cosmic rays in some\nbottom-up scenario must be larger than the gyromagnetic radius R corresponding\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n48\n\n\fBR(\u03bc\u2192e\u03b3)\n\nTRH [GeV]\n\nFigure 21.

Candidate astrophysical\nsources include gamma-ray busters (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs).\nIf UHECRs are produced by such localized sources, one would expect to see\na clustering in their arrival directions. Such clustering has been claimed in both\nthe AGASA and Yakutsk data 120, but I personally do not find the evidence\noverwhelming. A correlation has also been claimed with BL Lac objects 121 , which\nare AGNs emitting relativistic jets pointing towards us, but this is also a claim that\nI should like to see confirmed by more data, as will be provided soon by the HiRes\nand Auger experiments.\n15\nFavoured top-down scenarios involve physics at the GUT scale >\n\u223c 10 GeV that\nproduces UHECRs with energies \u223c 1012 GeV via some 'trickle-down' mechanism.\nSuggestions have included topological structures, such as cosmic strings, that are\npresent in some GUTs and would radiate energetic particles, and the decays of\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n49\n\n\fFigure 22. Energetic particles propagating through the Universe scatter on relic photons, imposing\na cutoff on the maximum distance over which they can propagate 119 .\n\nmetastable superheavy relic particles.\nIn the latter case, one would expect most of the observed UHECRs to come from\nthe decays of relics in our own galactic halo. In this case, one would expect the\nUHECRs to exhibit an anisotropy correlated with the orientation of the galaxy 122 .\nThe present data are insufficient to confirm or exclude an isotropy of the magnitude\npredicted in different halo models, but the Auger experiment should be able to\ndecide the issue. One might naively expect that superheavy relic particles would be\nspread smoothly through the halo, and hence that they would not cause clustering in\nthe UHECRs. However, this is not necessarily the case, as many cold dark matter\nmodels predict clumps within the halo 123 , which could contribute a clustered\ncomponent on top of an apparently smooth background.\nHow might suitable metastable superheavy relic particles arise 124 ? The proton\nis a prototype for a metastable particle. As discussed earlier in this Lecture, we\nknow that its lifetime must exceed about 1033 y or so, much longer than if it decayed\nvia conventional weak interactions. On the other hand, there is no known exact\nsymmetry principle capable of preventing the proton from decaying. Therefore, we\nbelieve that it is only metastable, decaying very slowly via some higher-dimensional\nnon-renormalizable interaction that violates baryon number. For example, as we\nsaw earlier, in many GUT models there is a dimension-6 qqql interaction with a\ncoefficient \u221d 1/M 2 , where M is some superheavy mass scale. This would yield a\n4\ndecay amplitude A \u223c 1/M 2 , and hence a long lifetime \u03c4 \u223c M\nm5p .\n12\nWe must work harder in the case of a superheavy relic weighing >\n\u223c 10 GeV,\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n50\n\n\fbut the principle is the same. For an interaction of dimension 4 + n, we expect\n\u03c4\u223c\n\nM 2n\nm2n+1\nrelic\n\n(153)\n\nThis could yield a lifetime greater than the age of the Universe, even for mrelic \u223c\n1012 GeV, if M and/or n are large enough, for example if M \u223c 1017 GeV and\nn \u2265 9 125 .\nPhenomenological constraints on such metastable relic particles were considered\nsome time ago for reasons other than explaining UHECRs 126 . Constraints from\nthe abundances of light elements, from the CMB and from the high-energy \u03bd flux\nhave been considered. They provide no obstacle to postulating a superheavy relic\n15\nparticle with \u03a9h2 \u223c 0.1 if \u03c4 >\n\u223c 10 y. Hence, metastable superheavy relic particles\ncould in principle constitute most of the cold dark matter.\nPossible theoretical candidates within a general framework of string and/or\nM theory have been considered 124,125. These models have the generic feature\nthat, in addition to the interactions of the Standard Model, there are others that\nact on a different set of 'hidden' matter particles, which communicate with the\nStandard Model only via higher-order interactions scaled by some inverse power\nof a large mass scale M . Just as the strong nuclear interactions bind quarks to\nform metastable massive particles, the protons, so some 'hidden-sector' interactions might become strong at some higher energy scale, and form analogous, but\nsupermassive, metastable particles. Just like the proton, these massive 'cryptons'\ngenerally decay through high-dimension interactions into multiple quarks and leptons. The energetic quarks hadronize via QCD in a way that can be modelled\nusing information from Z 0 decays at LEP. Several simulations have shown that\nthe resulting spectrum of UHECRs is compatible with the available data, whether\nsupersymmetry is included in the jet fragmentation process, or not, as shown in\nFig. 23 127 .\nA crucial issue is whether there is a mechanism that might produce a relic\ndensity of superheavy particles that is large enough to be of interest for cosmology,\nwithout being excessive. As was discussed in Lecture 3, the plausible upper limit on\nthe mass of a relic particle that was initially in thermal equilibrium is of the order\nof a TeV. However, equilibrium might have been violated in the early Universe,\naround the epoch of inflation, and various non-thermal production mechanisms\nhave been proposed 128 . These include out-of-equilibrium processes at the end\nof the inflationary epoch, such as parametric resonance effects, and gravitational\nproduction as the scale factor of the Universe changes rapidly. It is certainly possible\nthat superheavy relic particles might be produced with a significant fraction of the\ncritical density.\nWe have seen that UHECRs could perhaps be due to the decays of metastable\nsuperheavy relic particles. They might have the appropriate abundance, their lifetimes might be long on a cosmological time-scale, and the decay spectrum might be\ncompatible with the events seen. Pressure points on this interpretation of UHECRs\ninclude the composition of the UHECRs \u2013 there should be photons and possibly\nneutrinos, as well as protons, and no heavier nuclei; their isotropy \u2013 UHECRs from\nrelic decays would exhibit a detectable galactic anisotropy; and clustering \u2013 this\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n51\n\n\flog10 E3J(E) (eV2m-2s-1sr-1)\n\n26.0\n25.5\n25.0\n\nAGASA\nAkeno 1 km2\nStereo Fly's Eye\nHaverah Park\nYakutsk\n\n24.5\n24.0\n23.5\n23.0\n17\n\n18\n\n19\nlog10 E (eV)\n\n20\n\n21\n\nFigure 23. The spectrum of UHECRs can be explained by the decays of superheavy metastable\nparticles such as cryptons 127 .\n\nwould certainly be expected in astrophysical source models, but is not excluded in\nthe superheavy relic interpretation.\nThe Auger project currently under construction in Argentina should provide\nmuch greater statistics on UHECRs and be able to address many of these issues 129 .\nIn the longer term, the EUSO project now being considered by ESA for installation on the International Space Station would provide even greater sensitivity to\nUHECRs 130. Thus an experimental programme exists in outline that is capable\nof clarifying their nature and origin, telling us whether they are indeed due to new\nfundamental physics.\n\n5.5\n\nSummary\n\nWe have seen in these lectures that the Standard Model must underlie any description of the physics of the early Universe. Its extensions may provide the answers to\nmany of the outstanding issues in cosmology, such as the nature of dark matter, the\norigin of the matter in the Universe, the size and age of the Universe, and the origins of the structures within it. Theories capable of resolving these issues abound,\nand include many new options not stressed in these lectures. Continued progress in\nunderstanding these issues will involve a complex interplay between particle physics\nand cosmology, involving experiments at new accelerators such as the LHC, as well\nas new observations.\n\nPPaC: submitted to World Scientific on October 30, 2018\n\n52\n\n\fReferences\n1.
