In\nquantum communication [1] where S is identified with the set\nof information carriers employed in the signaling process, this\nis equivalent to saying that a given communication channel\nis memoryless i.e. that it acts independently on each separate carrier. In recent years, however, the study of correlated\nchannels - sometimes called also channels with memory - has\nshown that interesting new features emerge when one makes\nthe realistic assumption that the action of the noise tampering\nwith the communication line is correlated over consecutive\ncarriers (e.g. see [2\u20138] and references therein). Such correlations have been phenomenologically described in terms of\na Markov chain which gives the joint probability distribution\nof the local Kraus operators acting on the elements of S [2].\nAlternatively they have been effectively represented in terms\nof local interactions of the carriers with a common multipartite environment which is originally prepared into a correlated\n(possibly entangled) initial state [6], or with a structured environment composed by local and global components [3\u20135].\nThe aim of the present paper is to provide a continuous\ntime description of correlated quantum channels in terms of\na joint Master Equation (ME) [9, 10] for S. This will lead\nus to identify the structure of the Lindblad generators which\nare responsible for the arising of specific correlations among\nthe carriers. We remind that determining if a given quantum\ntransformation is compatible with a Lindblad structure is in\ngeneral a computationally hard problem [11]. Also we notice\nthat a Lindbladian structure for the global system S in general may introduce non-Markovian elements in the dynamics\nof the subsystems that compose it, which also are far from\ntrivial to characterize, e.g. see Refs. [12]. To bypass such\ndifficulties in our analysis we will thus adopt a rather pragmatic approach, deriving the dynamical evolution of S from\na collisional model [13, 14] in which dissipative effects originate from a sequence of weak but frequent interactions with\na collection of uncorrelated particles which mimic the system\nenvironment. Consider hence a multipartite quantum system\nS, consisting of M - not necessarily identical - ordered subsystems S1 , S2 , * * * , SM . In what follows each subsystem is\n\nS1\n\nE1\n\u03b7\nU\n\nE2\n\u03b7\n\nE3\n\u03b7\n\nEn\n\u03b7\n\nM\nS2\n\nSm\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the process. The horizontal lines describe an ordered set of carriers S1 , S2 , * * * which interact with an ordered set of\n(possibly infinite) identical local sub-environments E1 , E2 , * * * via\nlocal unitaries USm En . Between collisions each sub-environment\nevolves according to a map M. The overall dynamics can be described as a ordered sequence of row or of column super-operators\n(visualized by the rectangular sets in the figure).\n\nsupposed to interact with a multipartite environment E consisting of a large number of sub-environments E1 , E2 , * * * via\nan ordered sequence of pairwise interactions (for a pictorial\nrepresentation see Fig. 1). As in [13, 14] the pairwise collision between the subsystem Sm and the sub-envirinment En\nis described by a local unitary USm En = exp[\u2212igHSm En \u2206t]\ncharacterized by a collision time \u2206t and by the intensity parameter g, and generated by the Hamiltonian coupling HSm En\nwhich (without loss of generality) we write as\nX (`)\n(`)\nHSm En :=\nASm \u2297 BEn ,\n(1)\n`\n\n(`)\n(`)\nAS , BE\n\nwith\n6= 0 Hermitian. Accordingly the m-th carrier interacts with the first n elements of the environment E\nthrough the joint unitary\n(n)\n\nUSm E := USm ,En USm ,En\u22121 * * * USm ,E2 USm ,E1 ,\n\n(2)\n\n(the presence of a local free Hamiltonian evolution operat-\n\n\f2\ning between the collisions can be included in the model by\npassing into the interaction picture representation and replac(`)\ning ASm with the corresponding evolved operators). Finally\nto account for the internal dynamics of the environment, we\nassume that between two consecutive collisions each subenvironment evolves according to a completely, positive, trace\npreserving (CPT) map M.\nConsider then the case where the M subsystems of S are\ninitially in a (possibly correlated) state \u03c1(0) while the subenvironments of E are all prepared into the same input state \u03b7\n(which, as in Ref. [13], represents some equilibrium state of\nthe particles of the reservoir). For the sake of simplicity in the\nfollowing we will work under the hypothesis that\n(`)\n\nhBE Mm (\u03b7)iE = 0\n\n\u2200`, m ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we use the symbol h* * * iX to represent the trace over\nthe system X, and Mm to represent the channel obtained by\napplying m times the map M. The assumption (3) allows us\nto rigorously define the continuous limit of the model. It is\nworth noticing however that it does not imply any loss of generality as it can always be enforced by moving into an interaction representation with respect to a rescaled local Hamiltonian for the system S.\nAfter the interactions with the first n element of E the global\nstate R(n) of the system and of the environment is obtained\nfrom the initial state \u03c1(0) \u2297 \u03b7 \u2297n as R(n) = W (n,M ) (\u03c1(0) \u2297\n\u03b7 \u2297n ), where W (n,M ) is the super-operator which describes\nthe collisions and the free evolutions of E. As schematically\nshown in Fig. 1, it can be expressed as a composition of row\nsuper-operators stack in series one on top of the other\nW (n,M ) = RSM ,E \u25e6 RSM \u22121 ,E \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 RS2 ,E \u25e6 RS1 ,E , (4)\n(n)\n\nwhere RSm ,E := M\u2297n \u25e6 USm ,E . Here given, a unitary transformation U , we define U(* * * ) = U (* * * )U \u2020 . Also we use the\nsymbol \"\u25e6\" to represent the composition of super-operators\nand M\u2297n to represent ME1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 MEn , MEj being the\nmap M operating on the j-th element Ej of E. The transformation RSm ,E describes the evolution of Sm in its interaction with E plus the subsequent free evolution of the latter\ninduced by the maps M. Alternatively, exploiting the fact\nthat for m0 6= m, n0 6= n the operators USm ,En and USm0 ,En0\ncommute, W (n,M ) can also be expressed in terms of column\nsuper-operators concatenated in series as follows:\nW (n,M ) = CS,En \u25e6 CS,En\u22121 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 CS,E2 \u25e6 CS,E1 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere for all j = 1, * * * , n,\nCS,Ej := MEj \u25e6 USM ,Ej \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 MEj \u25e6 US1 ,Ej . (6)\nThanks to Eq. (5) we can now write the following recursive\nexpression for R(n):\nR(n + 1) = CS,En+1 (R(n) \u2297 \u03b7) .\n\n(7)\n\nI.\n\nTHE MASTER EQUATION\n\nFor a particular class of interaction unitaries, the Authors\nof [14] have shown that the collision model leads to a dynamics which can be described by a Lindblad super-operator via\ndirect integration of the equation of motion. Here we introduce an alternative approach which allows one to derive a ME\nfor the reduced dynamics of the many-body system S in our\ngeneralized multipartite collision model. The details of the\nderivation can be found in the Appendix. We simply assume\na weak coupling regime where we take a proper expansion\nwith respect to the parameters g and \u2206t which quantifies the\nintensity and the duration of the single events. In particular\nwe work in the regime in which g\u2206t is a small quantity\nand\n\u0001\nexpand the dynamical equation (7) up to O (g\u2206t)2 , i.e.\n\u0002\n0\nR(n + 1) = IS,En+1 + CS,E\ng\u2206t\n(8)\nn+1\n\u0003\n\u0001\n00\n2\n3\n+ CS,En+1 (g\u2206t) (R(n) \u2297 \u03b7) + O (g\u2206t) ,\n0\nwhere IS,En+1 is the identity superoperator while CS,E\nn+1\n00\nand CS,En+1 are the first and second expansion terms in g\u2206t\nof the superoperator CS,En+1 , respectively. Tracing over the\ndegree of freedom of the environment the resulting equation defines the incremental evolution of the density matrix\n\u03c1(n) := hR(n)iE of S when passing from the n-th to the\n(n + 1)-th collision. The continuos limit is finally taken by\nsending \u2206t to zero while g and n explode in such a way that\nn\u2206t and g 2 \u2206t remains finite, i.e.\n\nlim n \u2206t = t < \u221e ,\n\n\u2206t\u21920+\n\nlim g 2 \u2206t = \u03b3 < \u221e .\n\n\u2206t\u21920+\n\n(9)\n\nNotice that while the first condition is necessary to properly\ndefine the axis of time, the second is needed to guarantee that\nS fills the interactions with E. Indeed one easily verifies that\nthe linear terms in g do not enter in the dynamical evolution of\n(1)\nS since hCS,En+1 (R(n) \u2297 \u03b7)iE = 0 due to the assumption (3).\nDefining hence \u03c1(t) = lim\u2206t\u21920+ \u03c1(n) the reduced density\nmatrix of S at time t, and \u03c1\u0307(t) := lim\u2206t\u21920+ \u03c1(n+1)\u2212\u03c1(n)\nits\n\u2206t\ntime derivative, from Eq. (9) we get the following ME:\n\u03c1\u0307(t) =\n\nM\nX\nm=1\n\nLm (\u03c1(t)) +\n\nX\nm0 >m\n\n(\u2192)\n\nDm,m0 (\u03c1(t)) .\n\n(10)\n\nThis is mathematically equivalent to the standard derivation\nof a Markovian ME for a system inetracting with a large\nenvironment, in which one assumes that the overall systemenvironment density operator at any given time t of the evolution factorizes as in \u03c1(t) \u2297 \u03b7 where \u03b7 is the environment density operator. The two scenarios are however different. In the\nstandard case the reason for which the environment state is unchanged is because it is big. In our scenario, consistently with\nthe collision model, the environment state is constant because,\nas we said, each subsystem collides briefly with a sequence of\nsub-environments all initially in the same state. Of course one\nexpects a strongly non markovian behavior if a given subsystem interacts repeatedly with the same sub-environment [15].\nThe ME (10) contains both local Lindblad terms (i.e. Lindblad terms which act locally on the m-th carrier) and two-body\n\n\f3\nnon local terms which couple the M carrier with the m0 > m.\nMore precisely the m-th local term is the super-operator\n1 X (`,`0 ) \u0002 (`0 )\n(`)\n\u03b3\n2ASm (* * * )ASm\nLm (* * * ) =\n2 0 m\n`,`\n\n(`) (`0 )\n(`) (`0 ) \u0003\n\u2212ASm ASm (* * * ) \u2212 (* * * )ASm ASm , (11)\n(`,`0 )\n\nwhere the non negative matrix \u03b3m\n0\n\n(`)\n\n0\n\n(` )\n\n(`,` )\n\u03b3m\n:= \u03b3 hBE BE\n\nis given by\n\nMm\u22121 (\u03b7)iE ,\n\n\u2212\n\n`,`0\n\ni\nX (`,`0 ) h\n(`0 )\n(`)\n\u2212\n[\u03b3m,m0 ]\u2217 (* * * ), ASm0\nASm (13)\n\u2212\n\n(`,`0 )\n\nwith [* * * , * * * ]\u2212 being the commutation matrix and \u03b3m,m0 being the complex matrix [17]\n(`0 )\n\n(`,`0 )\n\n0\n\n(`)\n\n\u03b3m,m0 := \u03b3 hBE Mm \u2212m (BE Mm\u22121 (\u03b7)) iE .\n\n(14)\n\n(`,`0 )\n\nThe coefficients \u03b3m,m0 introduce cross correlation among the\ncarriers and depend upon their distance m0 \u2212m. Furthermore,\nsimilarly to the the terms of Eq. (12), they also depend on\nm \u2212 1 due to the fact that the model admits a first carrier.\nHowever if we assume that for large m the sequence Mm (\u03b7)\nconverges to a final point \u03b70 , then we can reach a stationary\n(`,`0 )\nconfiguration where (for m \u001d 1) \u03b3m,m0 only depends upon\n0\n\n(`,` )\n\nthe distance m0 \u2212 m while \u03b3m\n0\n\n(` )\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(`,` )\n\n0\n\nbecomes constant in m, i.e.\n\n0\n\n(`)\n\n\u03b3m,m0 ' hBE Mm \u2212m (BE \u03b70 )iE ,\n\n(15)\n\n(`,` )\n\u03b3m\n' hBE\n\n(16)\n\n(` )\n\n(`)\n\nBE \u03b70 iE .\n\nA similar behavior is obtained also if we assume \u03b7 to be a\nfix point for M (a reasonable hypothesis if E is supposed to\ndescribe an environment in its stationary configuration). In\nthis case Eqs. (15), (16) hold exactly for all m and m0 , with \u03b70\nbeing replaced by \u03b7. Finally a case of particular interest is the\none in which M is the channel which sends every input state\ninto \u03b7 (this is the extremal version of the last two examples).\nUnder this condition one expects that no correlations between\nthe various carriers can be established as the environmental\nsub-systems are immediately reset to their initial state after\neach collision. Indeed in this case we have M(\u03b8) = h\u03b8iE \u03b7\n(`,`0 )\nfor all operators \u03b8, which, thanks to Eq. (3), yields \u03b3m,m0 =\n(`0 )\n\n(`)\n\n(\u2192)\n\n\u03b3hBE \u03b7iE hBE \u03b7iE = 0 and hence Dm,m0 = 0.\n\nCorrelations\n\nEquation (13) obeys to proper time-ordering rules which\nguarantee that the dynamical evolution of Sm is not influenced\nby the subsystems that follow it in the sequence, while it might\ndepend in a non trivial way on the carriers that precede it.\nIndeed when traced over the degree of freedom of the second\n(\u2192)\ncarrier Sm0 , the cross term Dm,m0 nullifies, i.e.\nD\nE\n(\u2192)\nDm,m0 (* * * )\n\n(12)\n\nwith \u03b3 as in Eq. (9). Equation (12) defines the correlation ma(`)\n(`0 )\ntrix of the sub-environment operators BE and BE evaluated\n(for the infinitesimal time interval \u2206t) on the density matrix\nMm\u22121 (\u03b7) which describes the state of the sub-environment\nafter m \u2212 1 free evolution steps [16]. For m0 > m the cross\nterms of Eq. (10) are defined instead as\ni\nX (`,`0 ) (`) h\n(`0 )\n(\u2192)\n\u03b3m,m0 ASm (* * * ), ASm0\nDm,m0 (* * * ) =\n\n`,`0\n\nA.\n\nSm0\n\n=0,\n\n(17)\n\nwhile in general it does not disappear when tracing over Sm\n(`,`0 )\n(it does disappear however if all the coefficients \u03b3m,m0 are\nreal, see below). The evolution described by Eq. (10) is thus\nnon-anticipatory [18], or in the jargon introduced in Ref. [19],\nsemicausal with respect to the ordering of the channels uses.\nTo see this explicitly consider the evolution of the reduced\ndensity matrix \u03c11,2 (t) of the first two carriers obtained by taking the partial trace of Eq. (10) over all elements of S but\nS1 and S2 . Noticing that hLm (* * * )iSm = 0 and exploiting\nEq. (17) we get\n(\u2192)\n\n\u03c1\u03071,2 (t) = L1 (\u03c11,2 (t)) + L2 (\u03c11,2 (t)) + D1,2 (\u03c11,2 (t)) . (18)\nThe resulting dynamics is purely Markovian in full agreement with the fact that S1 , S2 couple weakly and sequentially with sub-environments E which have not interacted yet\nwith other carriers. Tracing over S2 we can then derive the\ndynamical equation for S1 , i.e. \u03c1\u03071 (t) = L1 (\u03c11 (t)), which\nagain is Markovian. Vice-versa the dynamics of S2 cannot be\nexpressed in terms of a close differential equation for \u03c12 (t)\nalone. Indeed by taking the partial trace of Eq. (18) over S1\nwe get\n\u03c1\u03072 (t) = L2 (\u03c12 (t))\n(19)\nh 0\ni\nX\n(`,`0 )\n`\n\u2212 2i\nIm[\u03b31,2 ] AS2 , hAS1 (t), \u03c11,2 (t)iS1\n,\n\u2212\n\n`,`0\n\nwhere the last term explicitly depends upon the joint density\nmatrix of S2 and S1 [20]. This formally shows that in general\nS1 acts as controller for S2 , while no back-action is allowed\nin the model.\nA case of special interest is represented by those situa(`,`0 )\ntions in which the matrices \u03b3m,m0 are real. When this hap(\u2192)\n\npens also the partial trace over Sm of Dm,m0 nullifies, i.e.\n(\u2192)\n\nhDm,m0 (* * * )iSm = 0. Accordingly the evolution of any subset of S is independent from the evolution of the remaining carriers. In this case hence our model becomes nonanticipatory with respect to all possible ordering of the carriers, describing hence a non-signaling evolution [19] in which\nthe reduced density matrix of each carrier evolves independently from the others. For instance in Eq. (19) the second\nline disappears yielding a Markovian equation also for \u03c12 (t),\ni.e. \u03c1\u03072 (t) = L2 (\u03c12 (t)).\na. Example:\u2013 As an application we focus on the case in\nwhich the carriers and E form two sets of independent bosonic\n\n\f4\nmodes. In particular defining am and bn to be annihilation operators of the modes Sm and En respectively, we consider the\nHamiltonians HSm ,En = am \u2297b\u2020n +a\u2020m \u2297bn . We also take \u03b7 as\nthe vacuum state of En . and M as a lossy Bosonic quantum\nchannel of transmissivity \u03ba. Notice that with these choices the\n(`)\n(`)\nHermitian operators ASm and BEn entering in Eq. (1) are just\nquadrature operators of the fields, and that Eq. (3) is automatically verified for all m since M(\u03b7) = \u03b7. The resulting model\ndescribes a correlated quantum channel analogous to that of\nRef. [8] which mimics the transmission of a sequence of optical pulses along an attenuating optical fiber characterized\nby finite relaxation times. The corresponding local Lm (* * * )\n(\u2192)\nand cross term Dm,m0 entering in the final ME (10) become\n\b\nrespectively \u03b32 2am (* * * )am \u2212 a\u2020m am (* * * ) \u2212 (* * * )a\u2020m am\n\nlisional events. Subsequently we show how to include free\nevolution terms induced by local Hamiltonians operating on\nthe carriers in the derivation of the ME.\n\n1.\n\nThe starting point of the derivation is Eq. (9) which under\npartial trace over E yields the identity\nD\n\u0001E\n0\n(A1)\n\u03c1(n + 1) = \u03c1(n) + (g\u2206t) CS,E\nR(n)\n\u2297\n\u03b7\nn+1\nE\nD\nE\n\u0001\n\u0001\n00\n+ O (g\u2206t)3 ,\n+(g\u2206t)2 CS,E\nR(n) \u2297 \u03b7\nn+1\n\nm0 \u2212m\n\nand \u03b3\u03ba 2 {[am (* * * ), a\u2020m0 ]\u2212 \u2212[(* * * )a\u2020m , am0 ]\u2212 } which exhibit an attenuation of the signals and an exponential decaying\n(\u2192)\nin the correlations (in particular Dm,m0 (* * * ) coincides with\nthe cross term derived in Ref. [21] for a collection of QED\ncavity modes coupled in cascade).\nII.\n\nE\n\nIn this expression we need to specify the super-operators\n0\n00\nCS,E\nand CS,E\nobtained by expanding CS,En+1 up to\nn+1\nn+1\nthe second order in g\u2206t. To do so we notice that for each m\nand j, the super-operators USm ,Ej admit the following expansion,\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nIn deriving the ME (10) we assumed a specific ordering for the carriers of the model which implies that each\nelements in the sequence S1 , S2 , * * * , SM can influence\nonly the dynamical evolution of those which follow. This\nassumption was specifically introduced to account for the\ncausal correlations that are present in many memory quantum\nchannel models [18]. The collisional model however can be\ngeneralized to include more general correlations. For instance\ncyclical correlations can be accounted by identifying S1 with\nthe (M +1)-th element of the set of carriers in such a way that\nSM can influence its dynamics. To do so it is sufficient to add\nan independent set F of sub-environments F1 , F2 , * * * , FN\nwhich couple with S following a new ordering in which (say)\nall the carriers are shifted by one position (i.e. the element of\nF first interact with S2 , then with S3 , S4 , * * * , SN , and finally\nwith S1 ). A part from the new ordering the new couplings are\nassumed to share the same properties of those that apply to\nE (in particular we require that identities analogous to those\nin Eqs. (3), (9) hold). Under these conditions (and assuming\nno direct interaction between E and F) the ME (10) will\nacquire new extra terms which directly couple each carrier\nwith all the others. Specifically given m0 > m we will\n(\u2192)\nhave both a standard contribution of the form Dm,m0 as in\nEq. (10) but also a contribution in which the role of m and\n(\u2192)\nm0 are exchanged (i.e. something like Dm0 ,m ) that originates\nfrom the couplings with F. From this example it should be\nclear that by increasing the number sub-environmental sets\nand by properly tuning their interactions with S any sort of\ncorrelations can be built in dynamical evolution of the system.\n\nDerivation of Eq.

Under these conditions one can\nverify that Eq. (A11) still apply.
