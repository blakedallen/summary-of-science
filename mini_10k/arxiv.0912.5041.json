Introduction\nIn classical electrodynamics the conservation of electric charge, which is expressed through\nthe continuity equation\n\u2207*J+\n\n\u2202\u03c1\n= 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nis not usually considered to be an independent assumption but a formal consequence of\nMaxwell's equations. The familiar argument is that the divergence of the Ampere-Maxwell\nlaw together with the Gauss law yield equation (1). Regarding equation (1) Griffiths has\nwritten [1]: \"This is, of course, the continuity equation -the precise mathematical statement\nof local conservation of charge. As I indicated earlier, it can be derived from Maxwell's\nequations. Conservation of charge is not an independent assumption, but a consequence of\nthe laws of electrodynamics.\" The argument is certainly more elegant in spacetime where\nthe covariant form of the continuity equation reads \u2202\u03bd J \u03bd = 0. By applying the operator \u2202\u03bd\nto the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations (in Gaussian units) \u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd = (4\u03c0/c)J \u03bd we obtain\n\u2202\u03bd J \u03bd = 0 because of the identity \u2202\u03bd \u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 0.\nNevertheless, we have recently questioned [2] the traditional idea that charge conservation\nis a consequence of Maxwell's equations. In most textbooks the Ampere-Maxwell law,\none of the Maxwell equations, is introduced by assuming the validity of the continuity\nequation. This fact involves a circular reasoning: to obtain the Ampere-Maxwell law we\nassume charge conservation and therefore this conservation law should not be considered\nas a consequence of Maxwell's equations. Furthermore, from a historical point of view\ncharge conservation was the ingredient which allowed Maxwell to generalize the quasi-static\nAmpere's law: \u2207 \u00d7 B = (4\u03c0/c)J to the Ampere-Maxwell law: \u2207 \u00d7 B \u2212 (1/c)\u2202E/\u2202t =\n(4\u03c0/c)J. Accordingly, charge conservation should be interpreted as an axiom of Maxwell's\nequations rather than a consequence of them.\nWe have also demonstrated [2] an existence theorem for two retarded fields, which says\nthat given localized time-dependent scalar and vector sources satisfying the continuity equation there exist two retarded vector fields that satisfy four field equations. When the sources\nare identified with the usual electromagnetic charge and current densities and appropriate\nchoice of constants made, the retarded vector fields become the generalized Coulomb and\nBiot-Savart laws [3,4] and their associated field equations become Maxwell's equations. We\nhave concluded that charge conservation is the fundamental axiom underlying Maxwell's\n2\n\n\fequations. Our derivation of Maxwell's equations has been commented on by Jefimenko\n[5,6] and Kapus\u0300cik [7,8]. Colussi and Wickramasekara [9] have stressed the result that\nMaxwell's equations, which are Lorentz-invariant, have been obtained from the continuity\nequation, which is Galilei-invariant according to these authors.\nAn advantage of the derivation of Maxwell's equations presented in reference 2 is that it\nnaturally introduces the time-dependent extensions of the Coulomb and Biot-Savart laws in\nthe form given by Jefimenko [3,4]. However, a practical disadvantage of such a derivation is\nthat it involves unfamiliar and large identities involving derivatives of retarded quantities.\nIn this paper we extend our three-dimensional derivation of Maxwell's equations [2] to the\nfour-dimensional spacetime. We show how the covariant form of Maxwell's equations can be\nobtained from the continuity equation for the electric charge. The existence theorem for two\nretarded fields demonstrated in reference 2 is now formulated for a retarded antisymmetric\nfield tensor in spacetime. The existence theorem in spacetime is then applied to the usual\nelectromagnetic four-current and thus the electromagnetic field together with the covariant\nMaxwell equations are obtained. This four-dimensional derivation of Maxwell's equations\nis considerably shorter than that formulated in the three-dimensional space. Readers well\nversed in the mathematics of the spacetime of special relativity could find more simple\nand elegant the four-dimensional derivation because it does not involve large operations\non explicit retarded quantities but instead it involves simplified tensor operations in which\nretardation is implicit in the retarded Green function of the free-space wave equation.\n2. The covariant Maxwell equations\nGreek indices \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03ba . . . run from 0 to 3; Latin indices i, j, k, . . . run from 1 to 3; x =\nx\u03bc = (ct, x) is the field point and x\u2032 = x\u2032\u03bc = (ct\u2032 , x\u2032 ) the source point; the signature of\nthe metric of spacetime is (+, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212); \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is the totally antisymmetric four-dimensional\ntensor with \u03b50123 = 1 and \u03b5ijk is the totally antisymmetric three-dimensional tensor with\n\u03b5123 = 1. Summation convention on repeated indices is adopted.\nThe covariant form of Maxwell's equations can be written in Gaussian units as:\n\u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd =\n\n4\u03c0 \u03bd\nJ\nc\n\nand \u2202\u03bc\u2217F \u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere F \u03bc\u03bd is the electromagnetic field tensor and \u2217F \u03bc\u03bd = (1/2)\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba\u03c3 F\u03ba\u03c3 is the dual of F \u03bc\u03bd .\nThe antisymmetric tensor F \u03bc\u03bd is defined by its components F i0 = (E)i and F ij = \u2212\u03b5ijk (B)k ,\n3\n\n\fand therefore the components of \u2217F \u03bc\u03bd are \u2217F i0 = (B)i and \u2217F ij = \u03b5ijk (E)k . The source of the\ntensor F \u03bc\u03bd is the electric four-current: J \u03bd = (c\u03c1, J), which is a conserved quantity\n\u2202\u03bd J \u03bd = 0.\n\n(3)\n\nAs above mentioned, equation (3) seems to be a formal consequence of equations (2) because\nof the identity \u2202\u03bd \u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 0, that is, equations (2) imply equation (3). We will investigate\nnow the converse implication: To what extent equation (3) implies equations (2)?\n3. An existence theorem in spacetime\nLet us formulate the following existence theorem: Given the localized four-vector J \u03bd\nsatisfying the continuity equation\n\u2202\u03bd J \u03bd = 0,\nthere exists the antisymmetric tensor field\nZ\n\u03bc\u03bd\nF = d4 x\u2032 G(\u2202 \u2032\u03bc J \u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u2032\u03bd J \u03bc ),\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nthat satisfies the field equations\n\u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd = J \u03bd\n\nand \u2202\u03bc\u2217F \u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere G(x, x\u2032 ) = \u03b4(t\u2032 \u2212 t + R/c)/(4\u03c0R) with R = |x \u2212 x\u2032 | is the retarded Green function of\nthe free-space wave equation and \u2217 F \u03bc\u03bd = (1/2)\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 F\u03b1\u03b2 is the dual of F \u03bc\u03bd . The function\nG satisfies the free-space wave equation \u2202\u03bc\u2032 \u2202 \u2032\u03bc G = \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ), where \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) is the fourdimensional delta function. The integral in equation (5) is over all spacetime. We note that\nG is not an explicit Lorentz invariant object. This objection can be avoided by replacing G\nby the less-known retarded invariant form D(x, x\u2032 ) = \u03b8(x0 \u2212 x\u20320 )\u03b4[(x \u2212 x\u2032 )2 ]/(2\u03c0), where \u03b8 is\nthe theta function [10].\nThe proof of the theorem follows from the tensor identity\n\u2202\u03bc G(\u2202 \u2032\u03bc J \u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u2032\u03bd J \u03bc )\u2212\u2202\u03bc\u2032 (G\u2202 \u2032\u03bd J \u03bc \u2212 J \u03bd \u2202 \u2032\u03bc G) = J \u03bd \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\n\n(7)\n\nThis identity is of general validity for a four-vector J \u03bd that satisfies equation (4) but otherwise is arbitrary. In particular, equation (7) is valid when J \u03bd is localized into a finite\nregion of spacetime, property that guaranties that surface integrals in spacetime involving\n4\n\n\fJ \u03bd vanish at infinity. Equation (7) can be obtained from Eq. (4) as follows. Assume that\nJ \u03bd satisfies the continuity equation evaluated at the source point:\n\u2202\u03bc\u2032 J \u03bc = 0.\n\n(8)\n\nWe apply the operator \u2212G\u2202 \u2032\u03bd to equation (8) and add the term J \u03bd \u2202\u03bc\u2032 \u2202 \u2032\u03bc G to both sides:\n\u2212G\u2202 \u2032\u03bd \u2202\u03bc\u2032 J \u03bc + J \u03bd \u2202\u03bc\u2032 \u2202 \u2032\u03bc G = J \u03bd \u2202\u03bc\u2032 \u2202 \u2032\u03bc G.\n\n(9)\n\nThe left-hand side of equation (9) can be written as\n\u2212\u2202\u03bc\u2032 G(\u2202 \u2032\u03bc J \u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u2032\u03bd J \u03bc ) \u2212 \u2202\u03bc\u2032 (G\u2202 \u2032\u03bd J \u03bc \u2212 J \u03bd \u2202 \u2032\u03bc G) = J \u03bd \u2202\u03bc\u2032 \u2202 \u2032\u03bc G.\n\n(10)\n\nWhen \u2212\u2202\u03bc\u2032 G = \u2202\u03bc G is used in the first term of the left-hand side of equation (10) and\n\u2202\u03bc\u2032 \u2202 \u2032\u03bc G = \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) in its right-hand side, we finally obtain equation (7).\nWe integrate equation (7) over all spacetime\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\u03bd \u03bc\n\u03bd \u2032\u03bc\n4 \u2032\n\u2032\u03bc \u03bd\n\u2032\u03bd \u03bc\n4 \u2032 \u2032\n\u2202\u03bc d x G(\u2202 J \u2212 \u2202 J ) \u2212 d x \u2202\u03bc (G\u2202 J \u2212 J \u2202 G) = d4 x\u2032 J \u03bd \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03bc has been extracted from the first integral of the left-hand side.

Deriving Maxwell's equations\nLet us apply the existence theorem to the four-vector J \u03bc = \u03b2J \u03bc , where J \u03bc = (c\u03c1, J) is\nthe usual electric four-current with \u03c1 and J being the charge and current densities and \u03b2 is\na constant. Then there exists the tensor field\nZ\n\u03bc\u03bd\nG = \u03b2 d4 x\u2032 G(\u2202 \u2032\u03bc J \u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u2032\u03bd J \u03bc ),\n\n(18)\n\nwhich satisfies the field equations\n\u2202\u03bc G \u03bc\u03bd = \u03b2J \u03bd\n\nand \u2202\u03bc\u2217G \u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u2217 G \u03bc\u03bd can be written as\n\u2217\n\nG\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n= \u03b2\u03b5\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba\u03bb\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\u2032 G\u2202\u03ba\u2032 J\u03bb .\n\n(20)\n\nThe constant \u03b2 belongs to the \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-system which allows us to write electromagnetic expressions in a way that is independent of units [11]. The constants \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 satisfy the relation\n\u03b1 = \u03b2\u03b3c 2 with c being the speed of light in vacuum [11]. If we let \u03b1 = 1/\u01eb0 , \u03b2 = \u03bc0 , and\n\u03b3 = 1, we obtain expressions in SI units, and if we let \u03b1 = 4\u03c0, \u03b2 = 4\u03c0/c, and \u03b3 = 1/c, we\nobtain expressions in Gaussian units.\nTo verify that equations (19) are already the covariant Maxwell equations, that is, that\nthe tensor G \u03bc\u03bd identifies with the well-known electromagnetic field tensor F \u03bc\u03bd , we proceed as\nfollows. Let us label the components of the tensor G \u03bc\u03bd in equation (18) as G i0 = (\u03b2c/\u03b1)(X)i\nand G ij = \u2212\u03b5ijk (Y)k , where X and Y are two time-dependent vector fields. The components\nof the dual tensor \u2217 G \u03bc\u03bd can be obtained from those of G \u03bc\u03bd by making the dual changes\n6\n\n\f(\u03b2c/\u03b1)(X)i \u2192 (Y)i and (Y)k \u2192 \u2212[1/(\u03b3c)](X)k . Notice that \u03b2c/\u03b1 = 1/(\u03b3c). It follows that\n\u2217\n\nG i0 = (Y)i and \u2217 G ij = [1/(\u03b3c)]\u03b5ijk (X)k . Our plan is now to identify the vectors X and Y\n\nwith the electric and magnetic fields E and B.

(26) yield the three-dimensional form of\nMaxwell's equations in \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-units. By using equations (28), (29) and \u2202\u03bc = [(1/c)\u2202/\u2202t, \u2207],\nwe can write the four-vectors [11]:\n\u2202\u03bc F\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2202\u03bc\u2217F \u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b2 \u2202E\n\u03b2c\n,\n\u2207 * E, \u2207 \u00d7 B \u2212\n=\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 \u2202t\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2202B\n1\n.\n= \u2207 * B, \u2212 \u2207 \u00d7 E \u2212\n\u03b3c\nc \u2202t\n\n(30)\n(31)\n\nFrom equations (26), (30), (31) and J \u03bd = (c\u03c1, J), we obtain the three-dimensional form of\nMaxwell's equations in \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 units for sources in vacuum [11]:\n\u2207 * E = \u03b1\u03c1,\n\n(32)\n\n\u2207 * B = 0,\n\n(33)\n\n\u2202B\n= 0,\n\u2202t\n\u03b2 \u2202E\n= \u03b2J.\n\u2207\u00d7B\u2212\n\u03b1 \u2202t\n\u2207\u00d7E+\u03b3\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nIn particular, if we let \u03b1 = 1/\u01eb0 , \u03b2 = \u03bc0 , and \u03b3 = 1, then we obtain Maxwell's equations in\nSI units,\n5. Discussion\nIn section 4 we have established the identification G \u03bc\u03bd = F \u03bc\u03bd on the basis that equations\n(22) and (24) are already known. But suppose that we do not know these equations but\n8\n\n\fonly the experimental time-independent Coulomb and Biot-Savart laws. In this case the\ntime-independent limit of the i0 component of equation (18) can be written as\n\u03b1\n(X) =\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\ni\n\nd3 x\u2032\n\n(R\u0302)i \u03c1\n,\nR2\n\n(36)\n\nwhere R\u0302 = R/R. From the experimental law f = q0 E for the force f acting on a charge q0\nwe know that there exists the electrostatic field E with components\n\u03b1\n(E) =\n4\u03c0\ni\n\nZ\n\nd3 x\u2032\n\n(R\u0302)i \u03c1\n.\nR2\n\n(37)\n\nComparison between equations (36) and (37) yields the identification X = E in the timeindependent regime. We consider now the time-independent limit of the i0 component of\nequation (20) which can be expressed as\n\u0012\n\u0013i\nZ\nR\u0302\n\u03b2\n3 \u2032\nd x J\u00d7 2 .\n(38)\n(Y) =\n4\u03c0\nR\nR\nFrom the experimental law f = \u03b3 d3 x\u2032 J0 \u00d7 B for the force f acting on a current J0 we\ni\n\nknow that there exists the magnetostatic field B given by\n\u0012\n\u0013i\nZ\n\u03b2\nR\u0302\ni\n3 \u2032\n(B) =\nd x J\u00d7 2 .\n4\u03c0\nR\n\n(39)\n\nComparison between equations (38) and (39) leads to the identification Y = B in the\ntime-independent regime.\nTherefore, by requiring that the time-independent limit of equations (18) and (20) be\nconsistent with the experimental Coulomb and Biot-Savart laws, we obtain the identifications\nX = E and Y = B in the time-independent regime. Such identifications naturally extend\nto the time-dependent regime of the theory and so we conclude again the identification\nG \u03bc\u03bd = F \u03bc\u03bd . Let us imagine for a moment that there is a physicist that only knows the\nexperimental Coulomb and Biot-Savart laws. He then can infer the electromagnetic field\ntogether with Maxwell's equations by assuming the validity of the continuity equation. The\nphysicist would correctly conclude that charge conservation is the fundamental postulate\nunderlying Maxwell's equations.\nIt can be argued that the derivation of the covariant form of Maxwell's equations from the\ncontinuity equation involves other implicit physical postulates like retardation (causality)\nwhich is implicit in the use of the retarded Green function G. If instead of the Minkowski\n9\n\n\fspacetime with metric signature (+, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212) together with its associated retarded Green\nfunction G = \u03b4{t\u2032 \u2212 t + R/c}/(4\u03c0R), we consider, for example, an Euclidean four-space\n[12-14] with metric signature (+, +, +, +) together with its associated retarded-imaginary\nGreen function [14] GI = \u03b4{t\u2032 \u2212 t + R/(ic)}/(4\u03c0R), then we obtain a set of Maxwell-like\nfield equations in the Euclidean four-space [12-14]. This means that the continuity equation\ncan also imply other electromagnetic theories different from that of Maxwell. This is an\nexpected result because charge conservation is independent of the signature of the metric of\nspacetime. The independence of the signature can be verified in the equation\n\u2202\u03b1 J \u03b1 = \u2202 \u03b1 J\u03b1 = \u2207 * J +\n\n\u2202\u03c1\n= \u2202\u02c6\u03b1 J\u02c6\u03b1 = \u2202\u02c6\u03b1 J\u02c6\u03b1 ,\n\u2202t\n\n(40)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03b1 = [(1/c)\u2202/\u2202t, \u2207], \u2202 \u03b1 = [(1/c)\u2202/\u2202t, \u2212\u2207], J\u03b1 = (c\u03c1, \u2212J) and J \u03b1 = (c\u03c1, J) are\nobjects in the Minkowski spacetime and \u2202\u02c6\u03b1 = [(1/c)\u2202/\u2202t, \u2207], \u2202\u02c6\u03b1 = [(1/c)\u2202/\u2202t, \u2207], J\u02c6\u03b1 =\n(c\u03c1, J) and J\u02c6\u03b1 = (c\u03c1, J) are objects in the Euclidean spacetime (there is no difference between covariance and contravariance in this spacetime). Hehl and Obukhov [15] have pointed\nout that charge conservation is metric-independent because it is based on a counting procedure for elementary charges. Therefore if one first postulates the validity of the continuity\nequation in any four-space, the particular use of the Minkowski spacetime (together with its\nassociated retarded Green function G) would not really be a new postulate, but only just a\nparticular application of the initial postulate.\n6. The subtle relation between sources and fields: Is this an egg-hen problem?\nA referee has pointed out that \u2202\u03c1/\u2202t and J can only be produced by electric and magnetic\nfields (take Ohm's law for instance J = \u03c3E). Therefore a circular process seems to be\nunavoidable in electromagnetism: \u03c1 and J imply E and B which in turn imply new \u03c11 and\nJ1 , and so on. Because of this circular characteristic, it is not clear if E and B (satisfying\nMaxwell's equations) are a consequence of \u03c1 and J (satisfying the continuity equation) or vice\nversa. According to the referee it seems a matter of taste to say which one is a consequence\nof the other. In other words: From referee's comment we could conclude that the connection\nbetween sources and fields is a little bit like the egg-hen problem: Who was first?\nLet us to briefly discuss the very deep relation between sources and fields in the context\nof the electromagnetic theory. It is now a common place to say that charges and currents are\nthe causes of the electric and magnetic fields, but this was not so in the 19th century [16,17].\n10\n\n\fTwo rival point of views on what is now known as electromagnetic theory coexisted through\nmost of the 19th century. On one hand, the field point of view followed by Faraday, Maxwell,\nThomson, Fitzgerald, and Larmor who considered the fields (and their \"observable\" lines of\nforce) to be the primary objects of the theory. They viewed the charges as manifestations\nof the terminal points of lines of force having no independent or substantial existence [17].\nOn the other hand, the charge-interaction point of view followed by Ampere, Neumann and\nWeber who considered the electromagnetic phenomena as originating in the interaction of\ncharges which was regarded by some as mediated by an ethereal continuum and by others as\na direct action at a distance. In the charge-interaction view, charges and currents were the\nprimary objects of the theory and the causes of the forces. Modern field theory of the 20th\ncentury resulted from a combination of these two point of views. Charges were regarded\nas sources of the electromagnetic forces (this was the legacy of the charge-interaction point\nof view) which were considered as propagating through the Maxwellian field (this was the\nlegacy of the field point of view).\nThe existence of a causal relation between sources and fields is now universally accepted\nin electromagnetism: \u03c1 and J (causes) produce the fields E and B (effects). This relation\nis clearly expressed by the retarded solutions of Maxwell's equations in the form of timedependent extensions of the Coulomb and Biot-Savart laws (in Gaussian units) [3]:\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0013\n\u03c1(x , t\u2212R/c)R\u0302 J(x\u2032 , t\u2212R/c)\ndx\n,\n\u2212\nE(x, t) =\nRc\nRc2\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2202\n3 \u2032 J(x , t\u2212R/c) \u00d7 R\u0302\n3 \u2032 J(x , t\u2212R/c)\u00d7 R\u0302\nd\nx\nB(x, t) = d x\n+\n.\nR2 c\n\u2202t\nRc2\nZ\n\n\u2202\n\u03c1(x\u2032 , t\u2212R/c)R\u0302\n+\ndx\n2\nR\n\u2202t\n3 \u2032\n\nZ\n\n3 \u2032\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\nAccording to these equations the values of E and B at the instant t are determined by the\nvalues of \u03c1 and J at the retarded (previous) time t\u2212R/c. This result clearly agrees with\nthe principle of causality which roughly speaking says that the causes (in this case \u03c1 and J)\nprecede in time to their effects (in this case E and B). Traditionally we place the causes on\nthe right-hand side of equations and the effects on their left-hand side.\nThe principle of causality provides then a reasonable argument to elucidate what are the\ncauses and what are the effects in electromagnetism. Who were first? By looking at Eqs. (41)\nand (42), our answer is straightforward: \u03c1 and J occurred first and therefore they should be\nconsidered the causes of E and B. This interpretation would seem incontrovertible -and\nso the supposed egg-hen problem involved in the source-field relation would be an illusion-\n11\n\n\fexcept because there exist also the so-called advanced solutions of Maxwell's equations,\nwhich can be written as\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2202\nJ(x\u2032 , t+R/c)\n3 \u2032 \u03c1(x , t+R/c)R\u0302\n3 \u2032 \u03c1(x , t+R/c)R\u0302\ndx\ndx\n= E(x, t),\n\u2212\n+\nR2\n\u2202t\nRc\nRc2\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2202\n3 \u2032 J(x , t+R/c) \u00d7 R\u0302\n3 \u2032 J(x , t+R/c)\u00d7 R\u0302\nd\nx\ndx\n\u2212\n= B(x, t).\nR2 c\n\u2202t\nRc2\n\n(43)\n(44)\n\nAccording to these equations the values of E and B at the instant t are related with the\nvalues of \u03c1 and J at the advanced (posterior) time t+R/c. We again invoke the principle of\ncausality to determine what are the causes and the effects in electromagnetism. Who were\nfirst? By looking at Eqs. (43) and (44) we note that E and B occurred first and therefore\nthey should be considered the causes of \u03c1 and J. Furthermore, if we introduce the variable\n\u03c4 = t + R/c then Eqs. (43) and (44) can alternatively be written as\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\nJ(x\u2032 , \u03c4 )\n\u2202\n3 \u2032 \u03c1(x , \u03c4 )R\u0302\n3 \u2032 \u03c1(x , \u03c4 )R\u0302\nd x\ndx\n\u2212\n+\n= E(x, \u03c4 \u2212R/c),\nR2\n\u2202t\nRc\nRc2\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2202\n3 \u2032 J(x , \u03c4 ) \u00d7 R\u0302\n3 \u2032 J(x , \u03c4 )\u00d7 R\u0302\nd\nx\n\u2212\n= B(x, \u03c4 \u2212R/c),\ndx\nR2 c\n\u2202t\nRc2\n\n(45)\n(46)\n\nThese equations say that the values of \u03c1 and J at the instant \u03c4 are related with the values\nof E and B at the previous time \u03c4\u2212R/c. In the light of the causality principle, the advanced\nsolutions of Maxwell's equations are consistent with the idea that E and B are the causes\nof \u03c1 and J, but the retarded solutions of these same equations are consistent with the idea\nthat \u03c1 and J are the causes of E and B. As above mentioned, the subtle relation between\nsources and fields in electromagnetism is a little bit like the egg-hen problem.\nIt can be argued, however, that the above analysis is purely formal and that other physical\nconsiderations allow us to identify the causes and the effects in electromagnetism. Suppose\nwe have an electron at rest which is associated with an electrostatic field. In this case,\nwe have neither retarded nor advanced times and so we cannot clearly distinguish between\ncauses and effects. Suppose now that the electron is accelerated by mechanical forces. The\nresulting electric current obeys the continuity equation and the reason the charge moves\nhas nothing to do with electromagnetism. Experience shows that the electron radiates,\naccording to Maxwell's equations, and that this radiation carries of electromagnetic energy,\nwhich must come at the expense of the particle's mechanical energy. The radiated energy\ndetaches from the electron, propagates off to infinity never coming back and we can physically\ndetect this electromagnetic energy. In this dynamical case the radiation fields clearly arise\n12\n\n\fas a consequence of the motion of charges which was originated by mechanical and not\nelectromagnetic means. This simple example shows that the continuity equation is valid\noutside the domain of Maxwell's equations and therefore it should be regarded as a stronger\naxiom.\n7. Concluding remarks\nR. G. Brown wrote [18]: \"... observe that if we take the 4-divergence of both sides of\nthe inhomogeneous Maxwell equations: \u2202 \u03b1 \u2202 \u03b2 F\u03b2\u03b1 = \u03bc0 \u2202 \u03b1 J\u03b1 = 0 the left hand side vanishes\nbecause again, a symmetric differential operator is contracted with a completely antisymmetric field strength tensor. Thus \u2202 \u03b1 J\u03b1 = 0, which, by some strange coincidence, is the\ncharge-current conservation equation in four dimensions. Do you get the feeling that something very deep is going on? This is what I love about physics. Beautiful things are really\nbeautiful!\" I think there is no strange coincidence. This is what I love about physics! The\nbeautiful equation \u2202 \u03b1 J\u03b1 = 0 representing charge conservation is the fundamental symmetry\nbehind the inhomogeneous and homogeneous Maxwell equations. \"That something very\ndeep\" is just charge conservation. To consider the continuity equation as the basic axiom\nto build the set of equations known as Maxwell's equations is then a very natural idea. In\nthis paper we have followed this idea by obtaining the covariant form of Maxwell's equations\nfrom the covariant form of the continuity equation.\nIt can be argued that other physical assumptions like the use of the Minkowski spacetime\nwith its speed of light c and its associated retarded Green function G are ingredients implicit in the covariant derivation of Maxwell' equations presented here. However, if we first\npostulate the validity of the continuity equation in any four-space, the particular use of the\nMinkowski spacetime (together with its associated retarded Green function G and speed c)\nwould not really be a new postulate, but merely an application of our initial postulate.\nWe advocate an axiomatic presentation of Maxwell's equations in undergraduate and\ngraduate courses of electromagnetism.\n\nAccording to Obradovic [19]: \"The axiomatic\n\nmethod offers the shortest way to the essence of any theory, enables its more accurate\nformulation and more profound and complete interpretation.\" In the case of Maxwell's\nequations the essence is charge conservation which should be considered the fundamental\npostulate for an axiomatic presentation of these equations. In the practice, undergraduate\ninstructors can find the basis for this presentation in equations (4a) and (4b) of Ref. 2 and\n13\n\n\fgraduate instructors in equation (7) of this paper.\n\nAcknowledgment\nUseful comments by an anonymous referee are gratefully acknowledged.\n\n1\n\nGriffiths D J 1999 Introduction to Electrodynamics 3rd edn (New Jersey: Prentice Hall) p 346\n\n2\n\nHeras J A 2007 Am.
