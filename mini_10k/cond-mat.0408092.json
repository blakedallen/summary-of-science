Different stacking sequences of\niodine, sandwiching Cd layers give rise to polytype structures. As many as 200 polytypes are recorded, however only\nfew occur commonly1 . Recent studies have revived interest in cadmium iodide films2,3,4,5 . These reports illustrate the\nvariation of optical properties of CdI2 film as a function of film parameters like its thickness, deposition rate, substrate\ntemperature, effect of heat-treatment etc. These parameters were shown to effect the grain size and residual stress\nin the film. Thus, the optical properties were shown to have a strong correlation with the grain size and residual\nstress. Grain size was also shown to increase linearly with the residual tensile stress beyond the threshold. The\ngrowth of grain size and its distribution, as stated, depends on parameters like film thickness, deposition rate etc.\nHowever, residual stress in the film can also alter film properties and performance significantly. In view of the potential\napplications in surface science6 and integrated electronics7 , studies on ion beam effects and plasma processing have\ngained significance in recent years. Desired and controlled modifications of physical and surface properties have been\nreported on ion irradiation8. Material modification such as grain size, morphology etc, can be achieved by bombarding\nmaterial with radiation or highly kinetic ions (plasma). This manuscript details the modification of optical properties\nby plasma irradiation (highly energetic Argon ions).\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nFilms of CdI2 were grown on glass substrates at room temperature by thermal evaporation at vacuum better than\n10\u22126 Torr. The starting material was 99.999% pure stoichiometric powder which was pelletized before placing it in\nmolybdenum boat for evaporation. The film thickness was monitored during its growth by quartz crystal thickness\n\n\fmonitor and was subsequently confirmed by Dektek IIA surface profiler (which uses the method of mechanical stylus\nmovement on the surface). The movement of the stylus across the edge of the film determines the step height\nor the film thickness. The film thickness was found to be uniform over an area of 6cm \u00d7 6cm. The structural,\nchemical composition, morphology and optical absorption measurements of the films were carried out by X-ray\ndiffraction (Philip PW1840 X-ray diffractometer), photo-electron spectroscopy (Shimadzu's ESCA 750), scanning\nelectron microscope (JOEL-840) and UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu's UV-260) respectively.\nIt was found that very slow deposition rate (< 1nm/sec) led to oriented film growth with tensile residual stress.\nHowever higher deposition rates (2-5nm/sec) lead to films with varying cell parameter (c) with increasing film thickness. The nature of residual stress was determined from X-Ray diffraction data. Since the effect of tensile residual\nstress on film properties has been extensively studied in an earlier report5 the films in this study were grown with a\ndeposition rate \u2265 2nm/sec to study the effect of compressive residual stress on film properties. Further, the plasma\nprocessing of the films is also pursued. Small pieces of the samples were cut and irradiated with highly kinetic Argon\nions produced by a Dense Plasma Focusing (DPF) device.\nDPF is used as a source of neutrons, X-rays, energetic ions, and relativistic electrons. Being such a versatile source,\nit has been used in various applications such as a neutron source for pulsed activation analysis9 , a spectroscopic source\nfor production of highly ionized species10 , a pump source for lasers11, a high flux X-ray source for lithography12 , an\nelectron source for micro-lithography13, and a highly energetic ion source for processing of materials14,15,16,17 and\nthin film deposition18,19 . The Mather-type DPF device at NIE-SSC-PFF, Singapore was used20 . Such a device is\npowered by a single 30\u03bcF, 15 kV fast discharging capacitor. Self-generated magnetic fields caused by the transfer of\ncapacitor voltage across the electrode assembly of the DPF device result in the formation of highly dense and hot\nplasma column during the collapse phase of plasma dynamics in the DPF device, just above the anode. Fig. 1 shows\nthe position where the film sample is mounted inside the DPF for exposure just above the anode.\nAn aperture assembly is kept between the film sample and the anode. This reduce the amount of copper debris\n(contributed by the copper anode) accumulating on the samples to be irradiated. During the entire investigation, a\ncharging voltage of 14 kV was used for the DPF device. The working gas used was argon, which was kept at a filling\ngas pressure of 1 mbar. A shutter was placed between the aperture and the film sample to avoid exposing the sample\nto weak ion beams produced while optimizing the DPF device for strong focusing. The shutter was removed after\noptimum focus was achieved, thereby exposing the sample to energetic ions in the next DPF pulse. By varying the\ndistance of the film from the anode, the average kinetic energy of Argon ions impinging the film can be varied. The\nargon ion energies at various distances from the top of the anode were measured by Rawat and Srivastava21 using a\nbiased ion collector.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nAll the films grown at room temperature were stoichiometric and polycrystalline. The stoichiometry was confirmed\nby ESCA (Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis). It has been reported that CdI2 films grown or annealed\nabove 300K were polycrystalline22 . The X-ray diffractograms of as grown and plasma irradiated films are shown in fig\n2. Our X-ray diffraction data agrees quite well with the powder diffraction data ASTM card 12-574. The structural\npolytype of the films can be identified as 4H from the cell dimensions. The various diffractograms are identified in the\n\n\fcaption. Figure displays only few representative diffractograms for the purpose of clarity although all the samples were\nstudied. The important observation is the (00l) parallel to substrate plane oriented growth in as grown and plasma\nirradiated at larger distance samples as revealed by the (00l) major peaks. Such growth of preferred orientation of\ncrystallite planes has been observed in earlier studies2,3,4,5,23,24 as well. However, we can see a modification in the\ncrystallite orientation from (00l) to (hh0) by the plasma irradiation at moderate distances. This fact can be noticed\nexplicitly in fig 3 where we have plotted the intensity of two major peaks changing with plasma irradiation. From\nthe figure, we treat three samples (irradiated at 6, 7 and 8cm) as mainly (hh0) or (110) orientated and rest as (00l)\noriented films.\nX-ray diffraction data was also used to determine the residual (or internal) stress in the sample. The displacement\nof diffraction peaks from their corresponding powder data indicates a uniform stress developed in the film during\ncondensation. If the diffraction peaks shift to lower angle (increasing d), a tensile stress can be realized. Similarly,\nthe decrease in d indicates a compressive stress25,26 . Figure 4 shows the displacement of the strongest peak, (002)\nfrom its corresponding powder data (ASTM No.12-574) as shown by the vertical broken line. The shift to the higher\nside indicates a uniform compressive stress in the films. The identification of samples is same as in Fig (2). We adopt\nthe same method used by Pankaj et al4,5 to quantify the residual stress present in the film. The actual residual stress\ncan be estimated by the strain produced, given by the expression\nd(Observed) \u2212 d(AST M )\n\u2206d\n=\nd\nd(AST M )\n\n(1)\n\nEquation (1) determines the strain produced in d spacing of (00l) planes which are the basal planes perpendicular to\nthe 'c' axis of the unit cell. The residual stress along in this direction can then simply be obtained by multiplying\nthe strain with the appropriate elastic constant of CdI2 . The diagonal elements (e.g. C11 ) of elastic tensor represent\npure tensile or compressive components. C11 = 4.91 \u00d7 1010 N/m2 (or 4.85 \u00d7 105 atm) for CdI2 crystal27 . The stress on\n(110) for (110) oriented three samples was determined similarly from the corresponding peak.\nWe have determined the cell parameters for all the samples studied. As mentioned above the direct consequence\nof the residual stress along 'c' axis, i.e. on (002), is the change in 'c' parameter. The 'c' parameter determined for\nthe plasma irradiated films at various distances from the anode was found to vary linearly with the residual stress\nas shown in figure 5. The as grown film had maximum compressive stress and plasma irradiation relaxes this stress.\nGood linear behavior also indicates the well oriented film growth. However, it should be noted that we have not\nincluded three data points of (110) orientation here although there is a little stress on (002) as well caused by that\non (110).\nWe have characterized all the samples for their morphology by SEM. The as grown films were having an average\ngrain size of 4.8\u03bcm. We have displayed few representative SEM pictures of plasma irradiated samples in fig 6.\nMorphological manifestations seem to be consistent with the structural studies. Morphology of samples irradiated at\n7 or 8cm is quite different from those irradiated at 9 or 10cm because of different crystallite orientations as discussed\nearlier. All the samples having (002) orientation show similar morphology but with different grain size. However, the\nsample irradiated at 7cm differs slightly in morphology from that irradiated either at 6cm or 8cm although all three\nsamples have same orientation (110). This could be possible because the sample irradiated at 7cm has minimum\nnumber of (002) planes parallel to the substrate plane as compared to other two samples, shown by peak intensities\nof fig 3. Nevertheless, we can analyze the effect of plasma irradiation on grain size from morphological studies. We\n\n\fhave shown such an analysis explicitly in fig 7. Quite good linear behavior shows a definite role of plasma irradiation\non grain size modification. It should be noted that the grain size of as grown or unirradiated sample was maximum\n(\u223c 4.8\u03bcm) and almost equal to that of sample irradiated at large distance (12cm). This shows that plasma ions break\nthe grains into smaller sizes depending on its energy. It is quite well known that the ion energy decreases linearly\nwith distance from anode. Therefore, a reasonably good linear behavior in fig 7 may not be surprising and indicates\na good processing method to modify grain sizes. We further analyze the relation between residual stress and grain\nsize as shown in figure 8. The positive side of the stress is tensile and those data are taken from the earlier report5\nfor the purpose of comparison. The negative side of the plot indicates the present data of compressive stress. The\nmain difference between the two sides is the plasma irradiation. A good linear relation between the stress and grain\nsize in the present study is the direct consequence of plasma processing. As mentioned earlier, the bigger grains\nwith considerable stress in as grown film break into smaller grains with reduced stress and better packing due to\nplasma irradiation. Possibly, the modification in grain size and its packing reduces the residual stress. In contrast,\nthe positive side indicates the development of residual stress due to the grain size growth and its distribution. Even\nthe morphology supports this. In the present study the grain size and its distribution is quite uniform unlike earlier\nreport. Therefore, the linear relationship in the present study further justifies and supports the other characterization\nresults.\nWe have also studied the optical absorption of all the samples. A typical absorption spectrum of one of the samples\nis shown in fig 9 for the purpose of illustration. The absorption coefficient \u03b1 was calculated as a function of incident\nphoton energy near the band edge from these absorption data as explained by Seeger28 . In general, the relation of\nthe type28,29\n\u03b1h\u03bd = (h\u03bd \u2212 Eg )n\n\n(2)\n\nwas fitted to the experimental data. The best fit was obtained for n= 1/2 indicating the direct allowed type of\ntransition. The value of Eg is determined by the extrapolation of the linear portion in the (\u03b1h\u03bd)2 vs h\u03bd plot as shown\nin the inset of fig 9. Obviously a direct type of transition is evident from the present data. However, lot of data and\ndiscussions are available in the literature on this issue. Both experiments30,31 and theoretical energy band structure\ncalculations32,33,34,35 reveal the existence of a direct and indirect band gaps in CdI2 differing by only 0.3-0.6eV. The\ndetailed analysis of this topic can be found in earlier report5 and the references cited therein. However, we do not\nfurther elaborate on this issue here. We have found the residual stress dependent Eg in this study. There may be\nseveral reasons for the change in Eg of the material. The effect of hydrostatic pressure on Eg is well known due to the\nchanging atomic distances in the unit cell. Therefore, similar effect should be expected from residual stress as well.\nWe have plotted Eg as a function of residual stress in fig 10 to examine such a correlation. Again, the negative side\nof the stress represents the present data while positive side is taken from the refence5 . However, it should be noted\nthat we have subtracted a constant 0.5eV from the positive side data for the purpose of matching them at zero stress.\nA shift of 0.5eV will not alter the basic trend or the qualitative behavior of Eg with stress.\nA reasonably good linear behavior of Eg with stress indicates a definite cause of stress on Eg . The sharp decrease\nwith tensile stress has been discussed in the earlier report5 . The overall linear behavior encompassing both positive\nand negative sides of stress may be indicating a common reason for the Eg modification. The amount of change of\nEg with pressure is given by the slope and is equal to 15\u03bceV/atm. There is only one report36 on experimental study\n\n\fregarding hydrostatic pressure effects on optical excitations in cadmium halides in the range 1000-3500atm. They\nhave found a linear increase of 5.5\u03bceV/atm for an optical edge at 4eV in CdI2 . The present data are also in the\nsimilar range and show a bit higher rate of change. The agreement can still be treated as good. However, the little\ndiscrepancy between the two could be due to the anisotropic nature of the layered structure of CdI2 . For example,\neven in the present study Eg of (002) and (110) oriented films has different slopes with pressure. We have shown Eg\nof (110) orientation by triangles in figure for comparison. The earlier report36 was on single crystal and direction of\napplied pressure was not mentioned. A consistent linear behavior with both compressive and tensile stress may well\nbe indicating a common mechanism of Eg change. Referring to electronic structure calculations of cadmium halides36 ,\nthe calculated and experimental band gaps decrease with increasing anion-anion distance in CdCl2 to CdI2 . The exact\nmodification in band structure due to the fractional change in anion-anion distance is hard to estimate at present.\nTherefore, we feel that the changing I-I distance in CdI2 due to the residual stress is responsible for the observed\nchanges in Eg with pressure. The amount of change in I-I distance may be different in differently oriented films and\nmay be different as observed here. The present data along with earlier similar one5 seem to be very much consistent\nand decisive. We hope this will be quite useful in understanding the interesting layered structured materials like CdI2\nwhich has been quite diverging. Although many experimental results37 clearly show anisotropic optical properties of\nCdI2 the calculated band structures32,33,34,35 show very little or absence of anisotropic nature.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe present study highlights the usefulness of plasma processing of CdI2 films in modifying its structural and morpholgical properties. A good linear relationship between ion energy (or irradiation distance) and material parameters\nlike cell parameter, grain size, residual stress etc. indicates the processing as a good technique. The consequent\nchanges Eg correlates well with the residual stress in the film. The combined data of Eg versus compressive and\ntensile residual stress show a consistent trend hinting the possible cause as changing iodine-iodine distance in the unit\ncell. This could be a useful, decent information and feedback for revisting band structure calculations of CdI2 which\nis otherwise diverging.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAuthors are thankful to the National Institute of Education, Singapore, for providing the ARF grant RP 17/00/RSR\nto fund the research project under which this investigation has been performed.
