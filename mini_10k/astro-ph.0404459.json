Accretion of material from the giant's wind\nonto the white dwarf can lead to eruptions that may last several years and raise the system's\nbrightness by several magnitudes. AG Draconis (BD+67\u25e6922) is one of the brightest symbiotics at UV and X-ray wavelengths and undergoes outbursts in 3\u20136 year long intervals that\nrepeat every 15 years or so. The observations described here took place during quiescence.\nThe components of AG Dra are a K0\u20134 giant and a hot star, most likely a white dwarf\n(Mikolajewska et al. 1995). For convenience we will refer to the hot component as a white\ndwarf for the remainder of this article. The temperature of the white dwarf is derived through\nfitting a blackbody curve to the continuum observed at X-ray and UV wavelengths, although\ncontrasting results are found: Greiner et al. (1997) finding a temperature of 170,000 K from\nROSAT X-ray spectra, while (Mikolajewska et al. 1995) finding 100,000 K from IUE spectra.\nThe system is a non-eclipsing binary with an orbital period of \u2248550 days (Meinunger\n1979; G\u00e1lis et al. 1999; Fekel et al. 2000). The radial velocity was found by De Medeiros &\nMayor (1999) to be \u2212147.46 \u00b1 3.54 km s\u22121 and they give the rotational velocity of the giant\nas 5.9 \u00b1 1.0 km s\u22121 . The abundances of the giant are well determined (Smith et al. 1996)\nand demonstrate that it is metal deficient and possibly a barium star. The distance to AG\nDra is crucial in fixing many of the properties of the system, yet it is rather uncertain, with\nthe Hipparcos satellite only yielding a lower limit of 1 kpc. Mikolajewska et al. (1995) argue\nfrom a classification of the giant for a distance of 2.5 kpc, which is the value we adopt in the\npresent work.\nAG Dra is a particularly attractive target in the far ultraviolet on account of the low\nextinction (EB\u2212V =0.05 Mikolajewska et al. 1995) along its sightline, resulting from the\nhigh latitude of the system (b = 41\u25e6 ). Spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer\n(IUE ) showed strong emission lines from highly ionized species including He ii \u03bb1640, C iv\n\u03bb\u03bb1548,1550 and N v \u03bb1238,1242 (Viotti et al. 1983). The first reported observations for\nwavelengths below 1200 \u00c5 were made by Schmid et al. (1999) who identified strong emission\nlines from O vi \u03bb1032,1038 and He ii \u03bb1085.\nWe report here observations made with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE )\nin the wavelength region 905\u20131187 \u00c5 made in 2000 March and 2001 April during a quiescent\nperiod of the system. These spectra are at a higher resolution and sensitivity than any\nprevious spectra in this range and reveal a number of new plasma diagnostics available for\ninterpreting the nebular emission from the system.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nThe instrument\n\nFUSE is described in detail in Moos et al. (2000) and Blair & Andersson (2001), and\nwe describe the main features of the spectrograph here. There are four telescope channels\nlabeled LiF1, LiF2, SiC1, and SiC2, each containing a mirror, a focal plane assembly and a\ngrating. The labels refer to the coatings on the mirrors and gratings, either silicon carbide\n(SiC) or lithium fluoride (LiF). The LiF coatings are highly efficient at wavelengths above\n\u2248 1000 \u00c5, but have very little efficiency for smaller wavelengths, hence the SiC channels\nextend the FUSE wavelength range down to 900 \u00c5.\nThere are two detectors, with the LiF1 and SiC1 spectra being imaged on detector 1,\nand LiF2 and SiC2 imaged on detector 2. Each detector consists of two segments, labeled\nA and B, which are read out independently by the detector electronics. The LiF and SiC\nspectra on each segment are treated individually by the FUSE calibration pipeline, and so\none refers to, e.g., the LiF1A spectrum, the SiC2B spectrum, etc. As there is a physical gap\nbetween each detector's two segments, there is a gap of \u2248 10 \u00c5 between the A and B spectra\nfor each channel.\nThere are three apertures on the focal plane assembly that are available for observing, the largest (30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032 ) and smallest (1.5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032\u2032 ) apertures were used for the AG Dra\nobservations.\nGuiding is done via a fine error sensor, which is fixed to the LiF1 channel. The target\ncan move in the remaining channel apertures due to thermally-induced mirror motions. The\nmotion of the SiC channels is generally greater than that for LiF2 and occasionally the target\ncan leave the aperture.\n\n3.\n\nData reduction\n\nVersion 1.8.7 of the FUSE calibration pipeline was run on the raw data files. In particular, versions 6 and 10 of the flux and calibration files were used, respectively. For the SiC\nspectra, only that portion of the observation for which the target was in the aperture (see\nSect. 4) was run through the pipeline to minimize background counts in the spectra.\n\n4.\n\nObservations\n\nThe components of AG Dra are not resolved by FUSE and so the spectra presented here\nshow emission from the entire system. Two observations were performed through programs\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nS312 and P248, and details are given in Table 1. The SiC channels were only aligned for\nsmall portions of the total exposure time in 2000 March, leading to effective exposure times\nof 440 s and 300 s for SiC1 and SiC2, respectively. The O vi \u03bb1032 flux from the 2000 March\nobservation was 2.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 in the center of the line, exceeding the FUSE\nflux limit of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 , and so a special observing sequence was employed\nfor the second observation to ensure the safety of the FUSE detectors. AG Dra was first\nobserved through the 1.5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032\u2032 slit (HIRS) which has a throughput around 50% of that\nof the standard 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032 slit and so the count rate on the detector at \u03bb1032 was reduced.\nCoupled with the expected fall in the \u03bb1032 flux due to observing at a different orbital\nphase of the system (Sect. 13), the effective \u03bb1032 flux then fell below the FUSE flux limit.\nAlignment of the target in the aperture is much more difficult with the HIRS slit and so\nobservation P2480101 consisted of three individual exposures. The \u03bb1032 line was used\nto check target alignment during the exposures as it is observed in all four of the FUSE\ntelescope channels and has a high count rate. The LiF1 channel was aligned throughout,\nwith only a small loss of flux in the third exposure. LiF2 showed a loss of flux of around 10%\ncompared to LiF1. A significant number of counts were only detected from SiC1 in the third\nexposure, but there are rapid variations in the count rate during this exposure and so these\ndata are not useful. SiC2 showed a relatively uniform \u03bb1032 count rate during exposures 2\nand 3, but very few counts in exposure 1.\nThe loss of flux in the SiC channels was anticipated and so a second observation was\nobtained with AG Dra in the LWRS aperture, but with the LiF focal plane assemblies moved\nsuch that the target would not lie in the aperture. The effective areas of the SiC channels\nare lower than those of the LiFs, while the degree of astigmatism is greater and so the count\nrate per unit area on the detector is much lower. This results in the count rate in the \u03bb1032\nline lying at a safe level. No loss of flux is evident during the single SiC-only exposure. A\nweak signal from the O vi lines was detected in the LiF channels due to scattered light from\nAG Dra.\n\n5.\n\nThe Spectrum and Line List\n\nFig. 1 displays the spectrum of AG Dra over the complete FUSE wavelength range\nassembled from the LiF spectra of the 2000 March observation and the SiC spectra of the\n2001 April observation. The key features are (i) a uniform continuum from the white dwarf;\n(ii) narrow, nebular emission lines from highly-ionized species; and (iii) interstellar absorption\nlines.\nThe present work will largely focus on the emission lines in the spectrum.

The shaded profiles in the middle plot show the O vi and He ii\nlines reduced by a factor of 50.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ndiscuss some properties of the interstellar lines here. Comparisons of the absorption line\nwavelengths with those of the emission lines shows that they are redshifted relative to the\nradial velocity of the system by \u2248 110 km s\u22121 and so are from the interstellar medium.\nAbsorption by the hydrogen Lyman series, O i, N i, N ii, Fe ii, Si ii and Ar i is seen, as well\nas numerous lines of H2 . Only one component to the absorption lines is seen; in particular\nno H2 absorption is seen at the radial velocity of the star. In the outer layers of the star\none may expect the AG Dra nebula to cool sufficiently to form a significant layer of H2 .\nWe estimate an upper limit of 1016 cm\u22122 to the H2 column density of this layer from our\nnon-detection.\nThe interstellar H2 absorption spectrum shows no lines from levels with J \u2032 \u2265 5, indicating relatively low excitation temperatures (< 1000 K). The H2 lines serve as useful fiducial\nmarks for fixing the wavelength scale of the FUSE spectra as many of the lines are not\nsaturated (unlike the atomic species). We adopt a velocity of \u221223 km s\u22121 for the interstellar\nlines based on IUE spectra (Viotti et al. 1983).\nIn the following sections some references are made to the interstellar H2 lines, and\nwe make use of the shorthand notation for referring to the H2 transitions introduced by\nBarnstedt et al. (2000). Thus, e.g., L13R3 refers to the \u03bd \u2032 = 13 to \u03bd \u2032\u2032 = 0, R(3) transition\nof the H2 Lyman band; while W0R3 refers to the \u03bd \u2032 = 0 to \u03bd \u2032\u2032 = 0, R(3) transition of the\nWerner band.\n\n5.1.\n\nLine list\n\nThe only AG Dra emission lines previously reported in the FUSE wavelength band have\nbeen the O vi \u03bb\u03bb1032, 1038 lines, and He ii \u03bb1085 (Schmid et al. 1999). The complete list\nof lines found in the FUSE spectrum is given in Table 2.\nThe measured wavelengths given for each line are those measured through Gaussian\nfits to the spectral lines, corrected to be placed in a reference frame where the interstellar\nabsorption lines have a velocity of \u221223 km s\u22121 \u2013 see Sect. 12. The spectrum with the largest\neffective area at the particular wavelength considered was used to derive the wavelengths.\nThe LiF measurements (990\u20131187 \u00c5) are all from the 2000 March observation, while the SiC\nmeasurements (905\u20131095 \u00c5) are from the 2001 April observation. Two fluxes are given for\neach line, corresponding to the two measurement dates. The first SiC measurements are\nmore uncertain due to short exposure times.\nLine identifications have been based on solar spectra, in particular, the catalogs of\nFeldman et al. (1997) and Curdt et al. (2001). There are several lines in the AG Dra\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nspectrum for which no obvious candidates from the solar spectra could be found. Some of\nthese lines are identified here and are marked with a (\u2217) \u2013 further details can be found in\nSect. 11.\n25\n\n20\nOI\n\nH2 L11P1\n\nCounts\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n971.0\n\n971.5\n\n972.0\n\n972.5\n973.0\nWavelength [ \u00c5 ]\n\n973.5\n\n974.0\n\nFig. 2.- SiC2A Spectrum from 2001 April showing the Ne vii \u03bb973 emission line. The\nspectrum has been binned by a factor 4. The shaded region denotes Ly\u03b3 airglow emission.\nThe dashed and solid lines demonstrate that the emission line escapes absorption by the Ly\u03b3\ninterstellar line (see text for details). Other interstellar absorption lines due to O i and H2\nare indicated.\n\n6.\n\nDetection of Ne VII\n\nA weak line is detected at 972.917 \u00c5 which if corrected for the AG Dra systemic velocity\nusing the measurement for the S vi \u03bb944 line (Sect. 12) gives a rest wavelength of 973.353 \u00c5.\nThis matches the 2s 2p 1 P1 \u2013 2p2 1 D2 transition of Ne vii which has been detected in the\nlaboratory by Edl\u00e9n (1983) at 973.35 \u00c5 and in solar spectra by Feldman et al. (1997). The\ntransition is analogous to the O v \u03bb1371 line which is formed, at the low electron temperatures found in the nebula, by recombination from O vi (Sect. 10). The identification of the\nNe vii line thus indirectly implies the existence of Ne viii in the AG Dra nebula.\nThe large radial velocity of AG Dra allows the Ne vii line to escape interstellar absorption by the H2 L11P1 transition at 973.348 \u00c5, yet it pushes the line closer to the interstellar\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nTable 1.

Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the SiC2A spectrum with a model spectrum, demonstrating that the Ne vii line is not significantly absorbed by Ly\u03b3. The model\nshows a uniform continuum, and the Ne vii \u03bb973.35 line, shifted by \u2212133 km s\u22121 . Two\ncomponents were required to model the Ly\u03b3 absorption. The first is at a velocity of \u221223 km\ns\u22121 with a column density of 5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (a b value of 10 km s\u22121 was chosen). This was\nestimated by fitting the damping wings of the H i Ly\u03b2 absorption line. The second component is at a velocity of \u2212108 km s\u22121 and has a column density of 5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 . This is\nrequired to fit the absorption between 972.1 and 972.3 \u00c5 and give the sharp edge at 972.1 \u00c5.\nNo atomic data exist in the literature for interpreting the strength of the Ne vii line.\nWe note that the flux is around a factor 10 weaker than the O v \u03bb1371 line (Mikolajewska\net al. 1995). The solar photospheric O/Ne ratio is 5.6 (Grevesse & Sauval 1998) and so the\nNe vii flux is consistent, within an order of magnitude, if the oxygen nebula conditions and\natomic data are extended to neon.\nThe implied existence of Ne viii in the AG Dra nebula is of great importance as the\nionization potential of Ne+6 is 207.3 eV making it the highest ionization species ever found\nin the spectrum of AG Dra (e.g., the ionization potential of O+5 is only 113.9 eV). It thus\nprobes a much deeper part of the nebula.\n\n7.\n\nThe O VI lines\n\nThe two O vi lines are the strongest lines in the FUSE spectrum and both show two\ndistinctive features: asymmetric profiles and enhanced continuum at the bases of the lines.\nThe \u03bb1038 line is affected by C ii \u03bb1037.018 and H2 L5R1 \u03bb1037.146 interstellar absorption\non the short wavelength side of the profile, which serves to make the \u03bb1032/\u03bb1038 flux ratio\nlarger than the optically thin ratio of 2. The long wavelength side of \u03bb1038 is unaffected by\nthe ISM and closely matches the shape and position of the \u03bb1032 line in velocity space.\n\n7.1.\n\nLine profile\n\nFig 3(a) shows the \u03bb1032 line plotted on a logarithmic flux scale, which reveals a P\nCygni-like profile for the line. On this plot we have overplotted a Gaussian profile derived\nfrom fitting only the continuum and the red side of the \u03bb1032 profile. Also shown is the\nexpected position of the L6P3 H2 absorption line. Clearly there is a possibility that it is the\nH2 line giving rise to a false P Cygni profile. Fig 3(b) shows the actual spectrum divided by\nthe computed Gaussian spectrum, revealing the absorption to be \u2248 200 km s\u22121 wide. This\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nis much larger than the width of other H2 lines in the spectrum \u2013 e.g., the nearby L6R3\n\u03bb1028.986 line has a FWHM of 30 km s\u22121 \u2013 and so we attribute the absorption to the O vi\nprofile. The fact that the blue wing of the \u03bb1032 line is being absorbed (in addition to the\ncontinuum) shows that the O vi emitting region is an expanding, optically thick medium.\nA P Cygni profile in the N v \u03bb1238 line seen in spectra from IUE was first reported by\nViotti et al. (1983), and discussed later by Viotti et al. (1984), Lutz et al. (1987) and Kafatos\net al. (1993). In all these cases the P Cygni profile was only found during the outburst phase\nof AG Dra. This may simply be due to the low signal-to-noise in the continuum during\nquiescent periods, however, and Viotti et al. (1984) note that the \u03bb1238 line \". . .is always\ncharacterized by a sharper blue wing. . .\", an asymmetry consistent with the profile found\nfor O vi \u03bb1032 here.

Overplotted is a model for the electron scattering wings assuming an\nelectron temperature of 30,000 K and an optical depth of 0.04.\n7.2.\n\nElectron scattering wings of the O VI doublet\n\nThe broad wings to the O vi profiles were measured previously by the ORFEUS echelle\nspectrograph (Schmid et al. 1999). They can be compared to the wings measured for the\nHe ii \u03bb1640 line by IUE (Viotti et al. 1983). Possible instrumental causes of the wings (e.g.,\ngrating scattering or 'bleeding' of the detector electronics) can be ruled out by the presence\nof sharp interstellar absorption lines in the wings and the fact that the absorption in the C ii\ninterstellar lines goes to zero. Schmid et al. (1999) suggested that the wings are caused by\nThomson scattering of O vi photons from nebular electrons, and equated the width of the\nwings to an electron temperature of 30 000 K. Using the expression of Bernat & Lambert\n(1978) for electron scattering in a layer outside of the line formation region, together with\nthe Thomson scattering redistribution function of Mihalas (1970) we find an optical depth of\n0.04 and an electron temperature of 30 000 K fits the O vi \u03bb\u03bb1032, 1038 line wings reasonably\nwell (Fig. 4). These values of the optical depth and electron temperature can be used to\nestimate a size and density of the O vi region. Since \u03c4 \u2248 \u03c3T Ne r, where \u03c4 is the optical depth,\n\u03c3T the Thomson cross-section, Ne the electron density and r the radius of the (assumed)\nspherical O vi emitting region, and the flux in the O vi \u03bb1032 line is related to Ne and r as\n(assuming the line is optically thin)\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n4\u03c0d2 F = 0.83\n\nhc\nnj\n4\u03c0r 3\nAb(O) Aji Ne2\n\u03bb\nNe\n3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere d is the distance to AG Dra, F the line flux, the factor 0.83 represents the ratio of\nprotons to electrons in a fully ionized plasma, h the Planck constant, c the speed of light, \u03bb\nthe wavelength, Ab(X) the abundance of element X relative to hydrogen, nj the population\nof the emitting level of the \u03bb1032 transition relative to the ion population, and Aji is the\nradiative decay rate for the transition. The O/H abundance is obtained from Smith et al.\n(1996), who measured the photospheric abundance in the giant, while the value of nj was\nobtained from the model of O vi in the CHIANTI database (Young et al. 2003; Dere et al.\n1997), assuming an electron temperature of 30 000 K, and an electron density of 1010 cm\u22123\n(note that nj /Ne is independent of Ne for the \u03bb1032 line, and so this choice does not affect\nthe derived result). The Aji value was also obtained from CHIANTI.\nThe two relations then imply\nNe r \u2248 7.52 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122\nNe2 r 3\n\n\u2248 4.15 \u00d7 10\n\n57\n\n\u22123\n\ncm .\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nThus one has r \u2248 17.3\u00d71011 cm (= 11 R\u2299 ) and Ne \u2248 1.0\u00d71011 cm\u22123 . Given the uncertainties\nin the various parameters, we estimate that these quantities are accurate to no better than\na factor of 5. The density is an order of magnitude higher than that derived from the O iv\ndensity diagnostic (App. B), which one may expect if the O vi is formed in a deeper layer of\nthe nebula.\nThis same calculation was performed by Viotti et al. (1983) when interpreting the\nbroad wings of the He ii \u03bb1640 line observed by IUE during an active phase of the system.\nThey ruled out the possibility of electron scattering on account of the large electron density\n(5.0\u00d71012 cm\u22123 ) they derived which was inconsistent with the density of \u223c 1010 cm\u22123 derived\nfrom the IUE O iv density diagnostic (see also Appendix B). We note that using the 2500 pc\ndistance to AG Dra instead of their 700 pc distance increases their He iii region radius to\n7.7 \u00d7 1011 cm and decreases their density to 3.9 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22123 , in reasonable agreement with\nthe O vi numbers. The optical depth of the electron layer is much greater from the He ii\nline than from the O vi lines, although one may expect the opposite case as O vi will be\nformed much deeper inside the nebula. However, Mikolajewska et al. (1995) found the AG\nDra nebula to be larger during outburst, when the Viotti et al. (1983) measurement was\nmade, which would thus lead to a larger optical depth.\nAnother possibility for the broad wings is that they represent the thermal emission\nof a fast wind with speeds 1000\u20132000 km s\u22121 . Such a scenario is presented in the AG\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nPeg observation of Nussbaumer et al. (1995), however in this case the broad wings are\naccompanied by a P Cygni profile in the N v \u03bb1238 line that extends out to velocities\n\u2248 1150 km s\u22121 . For AG Dra, the P Cygni absorption reaches only \u2248 200 km s\u22121 , and so it\nis unlikely that the broad wings are due to a fast wind. In addition AG Peg has a history of\nhigh velocity Wolf-Rayet features (Kenyon et al. 1993) while AG Dra has no such history.\n\n8.\n\nNe VI lines\n\nThe five Ne vi 2s2 2p 2 PJ \u2013 2s2p2 4 PJ \u2032 intercombination lines are prominent in the AG Dra\nspectrum between 992 and 1010 \u00c5. The \u03bb992 line is the weakest of the multiplet and found\nin the wing of He ii \u03bb992.363. Due to the large radial velocity of AG Dra the Ne vi \u03bb1005.696\nline is almost exactly coincident with the L8P2 H2 1005.397 \u00c5 interstellar absorption line,\nleading to a double-peaked profile for the emission line. The Ne vi \u03bb1010.247 line is truncated\non the short wavelength side of the profile by the H2 W0Q1 \u03bb1010.132 absorption. The \u03bb997\nand \u03bb999 lines are free from interstellar absorption and blending, and their ratio potentially\nallows a constraint on the nebular electron density to be made (Espey et al. 1996).\nThe model we use for the Ne vi ion employs the electron excitation and radiative decay\nrates from v.4 of the CHIANTI atomic database (Young et al. 2003; Dere et al. 1997).\nProton excitation rates are also included, but are negligible for the low temperatures found\nin nebular conditions. An important process to account for is photon excitation by the white\ndwarf radiation field. A star of effective temperature 1\u20132 \u00d7 105 K emits predominantly in\nthe extreme ultraviolet, between wavelengths 100\u2013600 \u00c5. The strong 2s2 2p\u20132s2p2 resonance\ntransitions of Ne vi have energies between 400\u2013600 \u00c5 and so will be strongly pumped by such\na radiation field at distances close to the star.\nPhoton excitation can be accounted for in v.4 of CHIANTI through specifying a black\nbody radiation field of temperature T\u2217 , and the distance from the star's centre, r, measured in\nstellar radii units (Young et al. 2003). For the AG Dra model, we consider two temperatures:\nthe value of 100,000 K derived by Mikolajewska et al. (1995) from fits to the UV continuum\nmeasured by IUE ; and the value of 170,000 K derived by Greiner et al. (1997) from X-ray\ndata from ROSAT. An electron temperature of 25,000 K is assumed. Figs. 5a,b show the\neffects on the Ne vi \u03bb997/\u03bb999 ratio for each temperature. The four curves in each plot\ncorrespond to different values of r. The shaded region on each plot denotes the measured\nratio, with 1\u03c3 error bars. It is clear that the observed \u03bb997/\u03bb999 ratio is incompatible with\nthe Ne vi ions being located at .500 white dwarf radii (Rwd ) from the white dwarf, and\nthus photoexcitation has a weak effect on the level populations. For a white dwarf radius of\n0.1 R\u2299 (Mikolajewska et al. 1995), this places the Ne vi ions at least 50 R\u2299 from the white\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ndwarf and a significant way towards the giant at around 300 R\u2299 (Mikolajewska et al. 1995).\nThe ionization potential of Ne+4 is 126.2 eV, which compares with 113.9 eV for O+4 , thus\nimplying that the O vi emission is from regions even further from the white dwarf. One can\nthus rule out the suggestion (e.g. Viotti et al. 1983; Mikolajewska et al. 1995) that He ii and\nN v emission is from very close to the white dwarf.\nOur Ne vi model can be affected if the actual white dwarf spectrum deviates significantly\nfrom a black body. In particular, the very transitions that are pumped in the Ne vi ion are\nlikely to appear as absorption features in a hot white dwarf atmosphere. A Kurucz spectrum\ncalculated for an effective temperature of 100,000 K and log g = 8.0, with solar abundances,\nshows Ne vi absorption lines whose depth at line center is around 30-60% of the continuum\nlevel. Thus photoexcitation may be overestimated by a factor of 2\u20133 in the black body\nmodel. We thus suggest that the \u03bb997/\u03bb999 ratio constrains the Ne vi ions to be formed at\na distance of at least 300 white dwarf radii.\nIn the case of a negligible radiation field, the electron density is restricted to the range\n5.5 \u2264 log Ne \u2264 10.5. Increasing the radiation dilution factor narrows the allowed densities\ntowards the higher end of this range, with the case of r = 500 implying densities of \u223c\n1010 cm\u22123 . This is consistent with densities derived from the intercombination transitions\nof O iv, measured with IUE Viotti et al. (1983). Fluxes obtained with IUE are reassessed\nin Appendix B with the most recent atomic data from CHIANTI. A density of 1010 cm\u22123 is\nderived.\n\n9.\n\nThe He II recombination lines\n\nThe Balmer series of He ii (transitions n\u21922, n\u22653) provide many emission lines in the\nAG Dra spectrum, from the n=5 line at 1085 \u00c5 to the n=20 line at 920 \u00c5. The even members\nof the sequence lie close in wavelength to the H i Lyman series, at around 0.3 \u00c5 shortward of\nthe H i lines. This, combined with the \u223c 100 km s\u22121 blueshift of the stellar lines compared\nto the interstellar absorption, is sufficient to make all lines from n=6 and above observable.\nCoincident blends with other interstellar absorption species prevent the strongest n=6 and\nn=8 lines being observed, but the n=10, 12 and 14 lines are all visible. These three lines\nare factors of 2\u20133 weaker than expected from the odd members of Balmer sequence and are\nblueshifted relative to these lines by \u22485\u201310 km s\u22121 (Sect. 12). This behaviour is puzzling.\nThe reduced fluxes are not due to an intrinsic property of the He ii ions as recombination\ndoes not favor odd over even members of the sequence. Any absorption (either stellar or\ninterstellar) must occur on the long wavelength sides of the lines to give rise to the observed\nblueshifts. The natural candidate is absorption through the damping wings of the hydrogen\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n0.5\n\nRatio [ energy units ]\n\n(d)\n0.4\n(c)\n(b)\n\n0.3\n(a)\n0.2\n\n(a) r=\u221e\n(b) r=500\n(c) r=100\n(d) r=10\n\n0.1\n0.0\n\nT*=100,000 K\n4\n\n6\n8\n10\nLog10 Electron density [ cm\u22123 ]\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0.5\n\nRatio [ energy units ]\n\n(d)\n0.4\n(c)\n0.3\n\n(b)\n(a)\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\nT*=170,000 K\n4\n\n6\n8\n10\nLog10 Electron density [ cm\u22123 ]\n\n(a) r=\u221e\n(b) r=500\n(c) r=100\n(d) r=10\n12\n\n14\n\nFig. 5.- Predicted variation of the Ne vi \u03bb997.14/\u03bb999.26 emission line ratio in the presence\nof 100,000 K (top panel) and 170,000 K (bottom panel) blackbody radiation fields. Four\ncases are shown, corresponding to the Ne vi ions being different distances (r, in white dwarf\nradii units) above the surface of the white dwarf. The grey band denotes the measured\n\u03bb997/\u03bb999 ratio from the 2000 March FUSE spectra. Atomic data are from the CHIANTI\ndatabase.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nlyman lines. However, both the \u03bb937 and \u03bb949 lines show continuum on their long wavelength\nsides which is at the same level as the continuum in the rest of the spectrum, ruling out\nabsorption by the H i lines.\nThe strongest of the He ii lines at \u03bb1085 is affected by interstellar absorption in the N ii\n\u03bb\u03bb1084.566, 1084.584 lines which result in an asymmetric appearance to the \u03bb1085 profile.\nWe estimate that the absorption removes around 30% of the He ii flux.\nThe He ii Balmer lines can be used to place constraints on the density and temperature\nof the nebula. Storey & Hummer (1995) provide emissivities for all of the lines up to\nn=50, calculated assuming Cases A and B of Baker & Menzel (1938) over a wide range of\ntemperatures and densities. Case A requires the He ii Ly\u03b1 line to be optically thin, which\nis not applicable for the AG Dra nebula on account of the high densities. We consider\nthe lines \u03bb958, \u03bb942 and \u03bb927 (n=9, 11, and 15, respectively) which are unblended and\nnot contaminated by interstellar absorption. The closeness of the three lines in wavelength\nminimizes any distortions in the line ratios due to dust extinction.\nFig. 7 plots the theoretical variation of the (\u03bb927+\u03bb942)/\u03bb958 ratio with density for\na wide range of temperatures. Also plotted is the observed ratio derived from combining\nthe SiC1B and SiC2A spectra from the 2001 April observation, and which has a value of\n0.95 \u00b1 0.08. It is clear that low nebula temperatures (T \u2264 104 K) are ruled out unless the\ndensity is also low (Ne . 108 cm\u22123 ), while for hotter nebula temperatures low densities\nare ruled out. Other plasma diagnostics (Sects. 10 and Appendix B) suggest a density of\n1010 cm\u22123 and a temperature of \u2248 2 \u00d7 104 K and these values are in reasonable agreement\nwith the He ii lines.\nThe He ii lines can also be useful in determining the extinction towards AG Dra. We\nconsider the \u03bb958, \u03bb1085 and \u03bb1640 lines (n=9, n=5 and n=3, respectively), the latter of\nwhich was observed many times with IUE and was found to have a flux between 2\u00d710\u221211 and\n8 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 during the quiescent phase of AG Dra (Gonz\u00e1lez-Riestra et al. 1999).\nAssuming no extinction and nebula conditions of T = 2 \u00d7 104 K and Ne = 1010 cm\u22123 , Storey\n& Hummer (1995) predict \u03bb1640/\u03bb958 and \u03bb1640/\u03bb1085 ratios of 24.2 and 5.49, respectively.\nIncluding the full range of variability of the \u03bb1640 line gives upper and lower limits of 143 and\n36 for \u03bb1640/\u03bb958, and 24 and 6.0 for \u03bb1640/\u03bb1085 (adjusting the \u03bb1085 flux for interstellar\nabsorption). These values show the observed \u03bb958 and \u03bb1085 lines are weaker than expected\nfrom the \u03bb1640 line, consistent with a non-zero EB\u2212V . Assuming a more precise \u03bb1640 flux\nof 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 based on the orbital phase of the 2001 April observation, and the extinction\ncurve of Fitzpatrick (1999) allows us to estimate an E(B \u2212 V ) value of 0.10 for AG Dra.\nThis value is significantly higher than that found by Mikolajewska et al. (1995), but we note\nthat the Fitzpatrick (1999) extinction curve is an extrapolation to FUSE wavelengths based\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\non observations made above \u22481200 \u00c5 and so may be in error.\n\n10.\n\nThe Nebula Temperature\n\nMethods for determining the electron temperature in the nebulae of symbiotic stars\nfrom emission line ratios are discussed in Sect. 3 of Nussbaumer (1987), with reference to\nIUE spectra. Temperatures for the nebulae were typically found to be /20,000 K, indicating\nthat the radiation field from the hot component of the symbiotic dominates the ionization\nbalance of the plasma, rather than electron collisions. The FUSE wavelength range opens\nup further diagnostic possibilities, and the use of O vi and C iii lines to constrain the plasma\ntemperature are discussed below.\n\n10.1.\n\nO VI, O V temperature diagnostic\n\nIn a highly-ionized photoionized plasma such as the AG Dra nebula, it is possible to\nuse the O vi \u03bb1032 and O v \u03bb1371 emission lines to determine the nebula temperature. For\nelectron temperatures \u223c 104 K the 2s2p 1 P1 \u2013 2p2 1 D2 transition of beryllium-like ions (e.g.,\nO v \u03bb1371) is predominantly formed through dielectronic recombination from the lithium-like\nion (e.g., O vi) into the 1 D2 level. The emissivities of such recombination lines vary slowly\nwith temperature. In contrast, for emission lines excited directly through electron collisions,\nthe emissivity falls sharply with temperature on account of the Maxwellian exp(\u2212\u2206E/kT )\nterm in the expression for the excitation rate coefficient. For temperatures & 104 K, the\n\u03bb1032 line is sufficiently strong that it remains electron-excited rather than recombinationexcited, and so the O vi \u03bb1032/O v \u03bb1371 ratio is an excellent temperature diagnostic,\nindependent of the relative concentrations of the two ions.\nRecombination data suitable for predicting the strength of the O v \u03bb1371 line are from\nNussbaumer & Storey (1984), while data for the \u03bb1032 line are from v.4 of the CHIANTI\ndatabase (Young et al. 2003). The \u03bb1032/\u03bb1371 ratio varies by several orders of magnitude\nover a small temperature range (Fig. 8), providing a tight constraint to the electron temperature. Measurements of the \u03bb1371 line at different orbital phases of AG Dra were presented\nby Mikolajewska et al. (1995). Using these values together with the O vi \u03bb1032 flux from\nFUSE gives the ratio indicated in Fig. 8, yielding a temperature of \u2248 25, 000 K, in good\nagreement with the temperature of 30,000 K derived from the electron scattering wings on\nO vi line profiles.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n10.2.\n\nC III\n\nC iii gives rise to two dominant spectral features in the FUSE waveband: the 2s 1 S \u2013\n2p P transition at 977.020 \u00c5 and the set of six 2s2p 3 PJ \u2013 2p2 3 PJ \u2032 transitions between 1174\nand 1176 \u00c5. These lines together with the \u03bb1909 line observed by IUE potentially allow both\nthe temperature and density of the plasma to be estimated.\n1\n\nThe \u03bb977 profile from the 2001 April observation is displayed in Fig. 9 and shows\nthe emission line to lie within a deep absorption trough in the white dwarf continuum. The\nabsorption on the long wavelength side of the profile is due to C iii in the interstellar medium\n\u2013 the AG Dra emission line is saved on account of the high radial velocity of the system. To\nthe short wavelength side is the O i \u03bb976.448 interstellar absorption line. The centroid of\nthe emission line is redshifted by \u2248 5\u201315 km s\u22121 relative to other species indicating that it\nis partially absorbed by the ISM components.\nThe \u03bb1176 feature is not detected (Fig. 9) and we estimate an upper limit to the flux\nof 4 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The \u03bb1909 was detected by IUE, and Mikolajewska et al. (1995)\ngive quiescent fluxes of 1\u20134\u00d710\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nFig. 10 shows the theoretical variation of the \u03bb1176/\u03bb977 and \u03bb1176/\u03bb1909 ratios,\nderived from the CHIANTI database. In each case the ratios are plotted at two temperatures:\n80,000 K and 25,000 K, the former corresponding to the temperature of maximum abundance\nof C iii assuming an electron-ionized plasma, and the latter the temperature derived in\nSect. 10.1 for the O vi region of the AG Dra nebula.\nThe measured \u03bb977 flux is a lower limit as the extent of interstellar absorption is not\nknown. The resulting \u03bb1176/\u03bb977 ratio can thus not discriminate the temperature of the\nplasma. Using the lowest of the measured \u03bb1909 fluxes, the upper limit to the \u03bb1176/\u03bb1909\nratio is overplotted in Fig. 10(b). Clearly the ratio is incompatible with a temperature\nof 80,000 K. A deeper exposure of the \u03bb1176 line together with a simultaneous and more\naccurate measurement of the \u03bb1909 line are required to improve the constraints on nebula\ntemperature.\n\n11.\n\nFluoresced and unidentified lines\n\nThere are several emission lines in the AG Dra spectrum for which no obvious identifications could be found based on solar spectra. These lines are listed in Table 3, together with\ntheir wavelengths corrected by a velocity shift of +136 km s\u22121 , which is the velocity of the\nNe v \u03bb1136 line. The corrected wavelengths should be within \u00b110 km s\u22121 of the laboratory\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nwavelengths of the transitions.\nAs many unidentified emission lines exist in the UV spectrum of the symbiotic nova RR\nTelescopii that were later identified as Fe ii transitions fluoresced by the strong nebular lines\n(Johansson 1988), we searched for Fe ii lines in the FUSE bandpass that could be similarly\nexcited. We initially searched for the lines identified by Harper et al. (2001) who found many\nFe ii lines fluoresced by H i Ly\u03b1 in the FUSE spectrum of the hybrid supergiant \u03b1 TrA. None\nof the unidentified FUSE lines matched the Harper et al. list. In particular, the 1133.70 \u00c5\nand 1139.02 \u00c5 lines, pumped via a line only 0.182 \u00c5 from Ly\u03b1 line center, are not present\nimplying either a narrow Ly\u03b1 line of FWHM / 0.36 \u00c5, or that the Ly\u03b1 line is formed far\nfrom the surface of the giant.\nIn order to find other fluorescence lines in the FUSE waveband a simple model was developed to predict spectra arising through radiative pumping of Fe ii and Fe iii by a Gaussian\nshaped emission line at a specific wavelength. The model calculates the quantity\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u03c9k 3\n\u03c6(\u03bb)\nNi Akj Aki \u03bbki\n\u03bbkj\n\u03c9i\n\n(4)\n\nwhere i, j and k are indices for the Fe ii levels such that the transition i \u2192 k is the transition\npumped by the emission line and k \u2192 j is the subsequent radiative decay; \u03c6(\u03bb) is the\nintensity of the fluorescing emission line profile at wavelength \u03bb; Ni is the population of level\ni relative to the ion population; Akj the radiative decay rate for transition k \u2192 j; and \u03c9i is\nthe statistical weight of level i. The model allows the centroid and width of the fluorescing\nemission line to be varied. The Ni are distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution,\nand the energy level and radiative data for Fe ii and Fe iii are from the compilations of\nR.L. Kurucz, available at http://cfaku5.harvard.edu/.\nWe considered pumping of both Fe ii and Fe iii by the O vi \u03bb\u03bb1032, 1038 doublet, and\nTable 4 shows the model predictions. A \u03bb1038/\u03bb1032 ratio of 1:2 was assumed, and the full\nwidth at half maxima of the O vi lines was taken as 0.30 \u00c5. For both Fe ii and Fe iii there is\nonly one significant transition that is pumped by the O vi lines; the resulting fluoresced lines\nthus have relative fluxes determined purely by the radiative decay rates for the transitions.\nThe Fe ii lines fluoresced by \u03bb1032 are all pumped through the same Fe ii transition.\nThe \u03bb1776, \u03bb1881 and \u03bb1884 lines have been identified by Johansson (1988) in IUE spectra\nof RR Tel and have also been measured in IUE spectra of AG Dra by Viotti et al. (1983)\nalthough the authors did not identify the transitions. The strongest of the predicted lines\nbelow 1200 \u00c5 is at 1141.172 \u00c5 which provides an excellent match with one of the AG Dra lines\n(Table 3). Another good wavelength match is found for the \u03bb1139.494 transition, however,\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n15\n\n15\n\n(a)\n\n12\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n10\n\n5\n\nFlux [ x10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 ]\n\nFlux [ x10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 ]\n\nFlux [ x10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 ]\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\nN II ISM absorption lines\n\n8\n\n6\n\nN II emission lines\n\n4\n\nHe II \u03bb1085\n2\n\n0\n936.0\n\n0\n936.5 937.0 937.5\nWavelength [ \u00c5 ]\n\n938.0\n\n0\n\n948.0\n\n948.5 949.0 949.5\nWavelength [ \u00c5 ]\n\n950.0\n\n1084.0\n\n1084.5\n1085.0\nWavelength [ \u00c5 ]\n\n1085.5\n\nFig. 6.- Plots showing the He ii \u03bb937, \u03bb949 and \u03bb1085 emission lines (Balmer n=12, 10\nand 5, respectively).

The shaded region shows the \u00b11\u03c3 errors on the observed ratio.\nthe predicted \u03bb1139/\u03bb1141 ratio is much lower than the observed ratio. None of the other\ntransitions can be identified in the AG Dra spectrum.\nApplying the same model to Fe iii yields two lines whose wavelengths are close to measured lines: \u03bb1066.195 and \u03bb1142.956. The latter is the strongest of the predicted lines in\nthe FUSE waveband and is in excellent wavelength agreement with the line measured at\n1142.429 \u00c5. The predicted \u03bb1070.557 line would be expected at a wavelength of \u22481070.16 \u00c5\nwhich is coincident with the H2 L3P3 \u03bb1070.142 interstellar absorption line and so is not\nseen. Although the model \u03bb1066.195 line is expected to be much weaker than the \u03bb1070.557\nand \u03bb1142.956 lines, there is a weak line found at a corrected wavelength of 1066.166 \u00c5 which\nwe identify with this transition.\nWe conclude that two of the unidentified lines can be identified as Fe ii \u03bb1141.172 and\nFe iii \u03bb1142.429, fluoresced by O vi \u03bb1032. Two more lines can be tentatively identified as\nFe ii \u03bb1139.494 and Fe iii \u03bb1066.195 based on wavelength matches, although the theoretically\npredicted fluxes are weaker than the observed values. As Fe ii and Fe iii are extremely\ncomplex ions, there is the possibility that the atomic data used in the theoretical model may\ncause the discrepancy in the fluxes.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nTable 4.

(1983) reported systematic redshifts of resonance lines relative to intercombination lines from IUE spectra of seven symbiotic stars (including AG Dra), with\nmagnitudes ranging from 10 to 40 km s\u22121 . The values given for AG Dra were 12 to 15 km\ns\u22121 . Viotti et al. (1984) gave a redshift of 9 km s\u22121 from their quiescent IUE spectra, but\nalso noted that the N v \u03bb\u03bb1238, 1242 doublet exhibited a larger redshift of 30 km s\u22121 relative\nto the intercombination lines. The first direct measurement of the O vi lines by Schmid et\nal. (1999) yielded a redshift of 49 km s\u22121 relative to the system radial velocity for the \u03bb1032\nline.\nThe cause of these redshifts has been attributed to the scattering of line photons in an\nexpanding medium (Friedjung et al. 1983), and this also explains the asymmetries noted in\nIUE spectra of the N v lines (Mikolajewska et al. 1995) and the O vi lines found here.\nBefore discussing the FUSE results, the accuracy of the FUSE wavelength scale must\nfirst be considered. Due to the lack of an on board calibration lamp, the absolute wavelength\ncalibration of FUSE is good to . 70 km s\u22121 for observations with the LWRS aperture due\nto motions of the target within the aperture, and the thermally-induced grating rotation1 .\nThe relative wavelength calibration within a single spectrum is accurate to around 5\u201310 km\ns\u22121 . In order to determine the absolute wavelength scale of the spectra it is thus necessary to\nmeasure features in the spectra for which the wavelengths are known through other methods.\nTypically one uses interstellar absorption lines for which velocities are known from IUE or\nHST spectra. For AG Dra we use the interstellar velocity measured by Viotti et al. (1983)\nof \u221223 km s\u22121 from IUE spectra using low ionization species. For each of the FUSE spectra\nseveral interstellar absorption lines are selected and their centroids are measured through\nline fitting. If the average velocity of these lines relative to their rest wavelengths is v, then\nwe apply a correction of 23 \u2212 v km s\u22121 to that spectrum. The lines selected in each spectrum\nwere based on the spectra of Barnstedt et al. (2000).\nThe velocities of selected emission lines are presented in Table 5. For the asymmetric\n\u03bb1032 line the centroid was estimated through minimizing the quantity\ng(\u03bb) = |\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbj | \u00d7 F (\u03bbj )\n\n(5)\n\nwhere F (\u03bbj ) is the flux in the wavelength bin \u03bbj .\nThe Ne v and Ne vi lines are intercombination transitions, and are found at velocities\n1\n\nThe FUSE Wavelength Calibration White Paper, http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/analysis/calfuse wp1.html.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nTable 5.

Aside from the O vi lines that are affected by P Cygni profiles, the\nother resonance lines are from S vi and S iv, which are consistent with the intercombination\nlines. Thus there is no indication from the FUSE spectra that the resonance lines are\nredshifted relative to the intercombination lines. The consistency of the S vi velocity shift\nwith the intercombination lines reveals that this high ionization state is not showing a P\nCygni absorption, restricting the size of the region participating in the wind.\nThe He ii Balmer lines are all significantly blueshifted relative to the other emission\nlines, which may indicate that the model assumed in deriving the rest wavelengths is in error\n(Appendix A).\nThe centroid of the O vi \u03bb1032 line is redshifted relative to the systemic velocity by\n39 km s\u22121 in reasonable agreement with the value of 49 km s\u22121 found by Schmid et al.\n(1999).\nAccurate measurements of emission line widths require good signal-to-noise relative to\nthe continuum level, and so we give values only for the strongest lines in the spectrum in\nTable 6. The O vi width represents that of the observed profile. One can estimate the true\nwidth of the line by assuming that it would have a shift comparable to the other emission\nlines in the spectrum of \u2248 \u2212130 km s\u22121 , leading to a width of \u2248 105 km s\u22121 . One may\nspeculate that the broader width found for Ne vi compared to Ne v may be due to the Ne vi\nions participating in the wind seen in the O vi profile.\n\n13.\n\nTime variability\n\nIncluding the present observations, the 900\u20131200 \u00c5 region of the AG Dra spectrum has\nnow been observed four times, and the fluxes of the prominent emission lines are given in\nTable 7. The ORFEUS-I/BEFS fluxes have been derived from the archived spectra available\nTable 6.

(1999).\nMonitoring of AG Dra with IUE showed that the emission lines are modulated by a\nfactor two during the orbit, with the strongest fluxes at phase 0.5 (Gonz\u00e1lez-Riestra et al.\n1999), when the white dwarf is in front of the giant. Both ORFEUS measurements of the\nO vi and He ii lines lie above the FUSE values, even though the 2000 March data were\nobtained close to phase 0.5. This suggests that the two ORFEUS measurements were not\ntaken during periods of quiescence, and this is confirmed by inspection of Fig. 7 of G\u00e1lis et\nal. (1999) where the U band flux is enhanced above quiescent levels at Julian dates 2 449 249\nand 2 450 409, corresponding to the ORFEUS observations.\nComparing the line fluxes from the two FUSE observations shown in Table 2 shows that\nthe O vi lines show the largest decrease in the 2001 April data-set, being reduced by 25%.\nThis is consistent with the factor of 2 modulation during the entire AG Dra orbit found by\nGonz\u00e1lez-Riestra et al. (1999). The Ne vi lines which have a comparable excitation potential\nto the O vi lines show a much smaller decrease in flux of around 10%. This may indicate that\nthe changes in the O vi flux may signal variations of the optical depth with orbital phase.\nThere was no variability beyond 2\u03c3 levels observed during 2 ksec of the FUSE observations of the O vi lines, despite there being \u2248 35 counts s\u22121 in the LiF1A channel.\n\n14.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe previous sections have presented FUSE spectra obtained in 2000 March and 2001 April\nduring a quiescent phase of AG Dra's \u224815 year outburst cycle. These represent the first high\nresolution, high sensitivity spectra obtained in the 905\u20131187 \u00c5 spectral region for AG Dra.\nThe high ionization states found in the FUSE bandpass reveal significant new information\nabout the system, unavailable from earlier, longer wavelength IUE spectra. In particular,\nthe presence of the Ne vii \u03bb973 recombination line implies the existence of Ne viii in the\nnebula, the highest ionization species ever recorded for AG Dra. The O vi \u03bb1032 line has\na P Cygni profile, demonstrating a wind in the high ionization part of the nebula during\nquiescence. Previously P Cygni profiles had only been seen in IUE spectra obtained during\noutbursts. The Ne vi intercombination lines are sensitive to the radiation field of the white\ndwarf and their ratios imply that the Ne vi emitting region (and thus also the O vi emitting\nregion) is at least 300 white dwarf radii (or 0.14 AU for Rwd \u2248 0.10 R\u2299 ) from the white\n2\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/mast.html\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\ndwarf. Evidence for the O vi being formed far from the white dwarf is also found from the\nFe ii and Fe iii fluorescence lines: the O vi resonance lines are capable of fluorescing iron\nlines in the giant's atmosphere, whereas H i Ly\u03b1 is not, suggesting O vi is formed close to\nthe giant's surface, while Ly\u03b1 is formed much further out.\nThe classical view of symbiotic nebulae has material flowing out from the giant and\nbeing ionized in the vicinity of the white dwarf. High ionization species (such as He ii and\nO vi) are found in the region around the white dwarf (e.g. Friedjung et al. 1983), while\nlow ionization species are formed at increasingly further distances. An alternative theory\nis that the strong nebular lines in high density systems such as AG Dra are formed in the\nilluminated part of the giant's atmosphere, helping to explain the orbital modulation of the\nUV line fluxes found from IUE (e.g., Altamore et al. 1981). Proga et al. (1996, 1998) have\ncreated non-LTE photoionization models for the ionization of a giant's atmosphere in the\ncase where it is illuminated by a hot companion star and have demonstrated that the general\nfeatures of symbiotic star spectra can be reproduced with high effective temperatures and\nluminosities of the companion. The large emission line fluxes of highly-ionized species can\nonly be reproduced if the giant has a wind extending to 2\u20133 giant radii.\n0.6\n0.5\n\nNe VIII\n\nNe VI\nO VI\n\nIon fraction\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.01\n\n0.10\n1.00\nDistance from white dwarf [ AU ]\n\n10.00\n\nFig. 11.- Predictions for the location of the O vi, Ne vi, and Ne viii ions in relation to the\nwhite dwarf, assuming a simple model for the ionization structure of the nebula (App. C),\nand a white dwarf black body temperature of 170,000 K.\nEvidence for the O vi lines being formed in the giant's atmosphere comes from the\naforementioned Ne vi result and Fe fluorescence lines.

Fits to the measured X-ray spectrum\n(Greiner et al. 1997) are consistent with a blackbody field of temperature 170,000 K. By\nconstructing a simple model of the ionization/recombination processes in the plasma (Appendix C) we can calculate the fractional population of Ne vi and O vi as a function of\ndistance from the white dwarf (Fig. 11). The distance here corresponds to the inner face of\na nebular shell, and the model assumes that the radiation field is unattenuated between the\nwhite dwarf and inner face. It is clear that such a hot blackbody prevents O vi and Ne vi\nbeing formed out to distances of 0.5\u20131.0 AU. For the model of AG Dra presented in Fig. 9 of\nMikolajewska et al. (1995) this places the O vi and Ne vi regions close to the surface of the\ngiant, and well away from the white dwarf. Ne viii, however, must be formed much closer\nto the white dwarf. A cartoon illustrating the structure of the AG Dra nebula is shown in\nFig. 12. A difficulty for this particular model lies in the P Cygni profile of the O vi line,\nsince the continuum in the far ultraviolet is due to the white dwarf and not the giant: for\nwhite dwarf continuum photons to be absorbed by O vi at orbital phase 0.5 (white dwarf\nin front of the giant), the O vi ions are required to lie in front of the white dwarf along the\nobserver's line of sight. We note however, that the electron scattered wings around the O vi\nlines significantly enhance the continuum (Fig. 4), and that the P Cygni absorption extends\ndown to around 3 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , the level of the white dwarf continuum, and not\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\nto zero flux. We thus suggest that the O vi ions are absorbing the electron-scattered O vi\nphotons and not the stellar continuum. This can be understood if the electron scattering is\noccurring in the densest part of the O vi region close to the giant, with the absorption of\nthe scattering wings then occuring in the lower density, extended wind. The high density of\n1011 cm\u22123 derived from the analysis of the wings in Sect. 7.2 supports this idea.\nA full understanding of the structure of the AG Dra nebula can only come through\ndetailed modelling of the ionization and wind structure, constrained by high quality spectral\ndata.\nWe thank S.D.

Kurucz are thanked for useful discussions.\n\nA.\n\nRest wavelengths of FUSE emission lines\nA.1.\n\nNe V\n\nThe two Ne v lines seen in the FUSE spectrum arise from decays of the 2p 5 S level to\nthe ground 2s 3 P1,2 levels. The separation of the two ground levels is strongly constrained\nby the measurement of the 3 P1 \u2013 3 P2 transition wavelength from SWS spectra obtained with\nISO by Feuchtgruber et al. (1997). They find a wavelength of 14.3217\u00b10.0002 \u03bcm.\nThe UV lines have only previously been measured by space-borne, solar UV spectrometers. Sandlin et al. (1977) give wavelengths of 1136.51\u00b10.02 \u00c5 and 1145.61\u00b10.02 \u00c5. Edl\u00e9n\n(1985) made use of these wavelengths to refine the energy levels of Ne v, leading to revised\nwavelengths of 1136.51 \u00c5 and 1145.59 \u00c5. More recently, the SUMER instrument on board\nSOHO has measured the lines. Feldman et al. (1997) give wavelengths of 1136.52 \u00c5 and\n1145.62 \u00c5 from off-limb spectra, while Curdt et al. (2001) give wavelengths of 1136.56 \u00c5 and\n1145.66 \u00c5 from disk spectra. The off-limb spectra are hampered by blending with coronal\nlines, though, while disk spectra of solar transition region lines typically show redshifts of\n5\u201310 km s\u22121 (e.g., Peter & Judge 1999). A detailed reassessment of SUMER disk spectra (Curdt 2001, private communication) yields revised wavelengths of 1136.551\u00b10.020 \u00c5\nand 1145.632\u00b10.010 \u00c5. We correct these assuming a redshift of 5 km s\u22121 and use the error\nestimates from the UV and IR wavelength measurements to minimize the energy level separations of the three levels. These yield new wavelengths for the UV lines of 1136.532 \u00c5 and\n1145.615 \u00c5 which are used in the AG Dra analysis.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\nA.2.\n\nNe VI\n\nAs with the Ne v lines, the Ne vi intercombination lines have only been measured in\nsolar spectra. The most recent determination of the lines' wavelengths is that of Dwivedi\net al. (1999) from off-limb SUMER spectra. However, these wavelengths show a serious\ndiscrepancy with the measurement of the Ne vi ground transition wavelength of Feuchtgruber\net al. (1997) from the SWS instrument on ISO. In particular the Dwivedi et al. wavelengths\nfor the 2 P1/2 \u2013 4 P1/2,3/2 transitions imply, when combined with the Feuchtgruber et al. (1997)\nwavelength, that the 2 P3/2 \u2013 4 P1/2,3/2 transitions occur at 1005.777 \u00c5 and 1010.303 \u00c5. Dwivedi\net al. actually measure the latter lines at wavelengths 1005.696 and 1010.247 \u00c5 \u2013 differences\nof 0.081 \u00c5 and 0.056 \u00c5 that are much larger than the 0.015 \u00c5 accuracy quoted by Dwivedi\net al. (1999).\nAnalysis of more recent SUMER spectra (W. Curdt, private communication, 2001) with\nupdated calibration files has resulted in revised wavelengths for the Ne vi lines giving values\nof 992.731, 997.169, 999.291, 1005.789 and 1010.323 \u00c5. These values have been used in the\nAG Dra analysis.\n\nA.3.\n\nHe II\n\nEach of the He ii Balmer series lines consists of seven individual transitions that, in\nterms of wavelength, can be split into two groups. E.g., for the n=5 transitions the groups\nare at average wavelengths of 1084.912 \u00c5 and 1084.977 \u00c5 (based on data from the NIST\ndatabase) \u2013 i.e., a velocity separation of 18.0 km s\u22121 . In order to compare the velocity shifts\nof the He ii lines with those from other ions, it is necessary to model how the individual line\ncomponents contribute to the total line flux.\nClegg et al. (1999) provides such a model for the He ii \u03bb1640 (n=3) and \u03bb1215 (n=4)\nlines, yielding estimates of the line centroids for a range of temperatures and densities, and\nfor Cases A and B of Baker & Menzel (1938). We extend this model for 5\u2264 n\u2264 20 with the\nmethod outlined in Sect. 3 of Clegg et al. (1999), atomic data from Storey & Hummer (1995),\nand A-values calculated with the FORTRAN routine described by Storey & Hummer (1991).\nEnergy level data were obtained from NIST. For n\u226512, energy values were not available for\nall of the 2 P, 2 D and 2 S levels. However, the wavelength splittings of the individual line\ncomponents are largely determined by the splitting of the n=2 levels for these high n levels.\nTo determine the expected wavelengths of the He ii Balmer lines for AG Dra, an electron\ndensity of 1010 cm\u22123 and a temperature of 2 \u00d7 104 K were assumed together with Case B.\nThe emissivities and wavelengths of the seven individual line components were calculated,\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\nand a combined synthetic profile was computed by assuming lines broadened by 50 km s\u22121 .\nThe resulting profile was then fit with a Gaussian, the centroid of this fit is the wavelength\nthat is listed in Table 2.\n\nB.\n\nRevised O IV density from IUE data\n\nO iv belongs to the same isoelectronic sequence as Ne vi, and the intercombination\ntransitions that occur for Ne vi in the FUSE waveband are found for O iv between 1397 and\n1408 \u00c5. These lines form ratios that are sensitive to the electron density between 109 and\n1011 cm\u22123 , and Fig. 13 shows the ratios, relative to the strongest \u03bb1401 line, calculated from\nthe CHIANTI database at an electron temperature of 25 000 K. Measurements of the O iv\nlines were made by IUE and the high resolution mode of the satellite allowed the individual\ntransitions to be measured. Two data-sets with good measurements of the lines are from\n1981 August 3 and 1983 June 7. The former was obtained several months after the system\nwent into a major outburst, while the latter was obtained during a quiescent phase. The\nline fluxes were very similar in each case, and the line ratios, relative to \u03bb1401, are shown\nin Table 8 and overplotted on Fig. 13. The ratios clearly show that the density lies between\n109 and 1010 cm\u22123 . The stronger lines have a higher signal-to-noise and so we favor densities\ncloser to 1010 cm\u22123 and this is the value assumed for the density of the nebula in the present\npaper.\n\nC.\n\nIonization model\n\nIn Sect. 14 results are presented from a model of the ionization balance of oxygen and\nneon ions in a photoionized plasma. The details of this model are given here.\nThe distribution of element ionization states in a plasma photoionized by a distant\nradiation source are determined by the distance to the source and the local density and\nelectron temperature of the plasma. The number of ions leaving an ionization state i through\nphotoionization is given by\n\u03b1i = 4\u03c0Ni W (r)\n\nZ\n\nB(T\u2217 , \u03bb)\u03c3(\u03bb)d\u03bb\n\n(C1)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the photoionization cross-section, B is the specific intensity of the radiation field,\nand W (r) is the dilution factor given by\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\nTable 7.
