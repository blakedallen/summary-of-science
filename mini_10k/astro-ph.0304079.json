Provided that the temperature of such gas was below the escape\ntemperature for a galaxy, he showed that the gas should extend several kiloparsecs above\nthe midplane. Spitzer's original arguments have been extended to a more general theory\nof the dynamical evolution of the gaseous disks of spiral galaxies. This so called \"galactic\nfountain\" model (Shapiro & Field 1976; Bregman 1980) postulates that the hot gas produced\nby multiple overlapping supernovae would be buoyant in the thin, cold disks of gas in spiral\ngalaxies. As the hot gas rises from the thin disk into the halo, it cools, perhaps forming\ncondensations of neutral material which then fall back towards the thin disk as high- or\nintermediate-velocity clouds.\nThe existence of such gas in the Milky Way is now well documented through observations of strong O VI absorption (e.g. Savage et al. 2000) and X-ray emission (Burrows &\nMendenhall 1991). The 1032/1038 \u00c5 doublet transition of Li-like oxygen (O VI) is an important tracer of hot, collisionally ionized material. At temperatures of \u223c 3 \u00d7 105 K, where gas\nof near-solar metallicity cools most efficiently, emission from the O VI doublet can be the\nprimary coolant. Hence, observations of O VI emission provide a direct probe of the cooling\nrate of material near this temperature. Furthermore, because the cooling of gas at temperatures of a few times 105 K is so much more efficient than that of material at higher (or lower)\ntemperatures, O VI emission traces rapidly cooling material that may condense into clouds\nin the galactic fountain scenario. Observations of O VI from this \"transition temperature\"\ngas in the halos of galaxies provide fundamental information on the circulation of material\nwithin spiral galaxies.\nAn O VI absorption line survey of the Milky Way (Savage et al. 2003) showed that the\nobserved O VI was best explained by a patchy disk corotating with the Galactic plane with\nsigns of outflows. O VI observed in emission in the Milky Way has been associated with gas\nin or around the Local Bubble (Welsh et al. 2002 and references therein) and an outflow\nfrom the Perseus arm (Otte, Dixon, & Sankrit 2003). With our improving understanding\nof the O VI distribution inside the Milky Way, it becomes necessary to search for O VI\nemission in other galaxies as well in order to be able to distinguish between peculiarities\nand common properties of galaxies. We analyzed spectra of two galaxies (NGC 4631 and\nNGC 891) taken by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). Both galaxies are\nnearly edge-on (i.e. allow clear distinction between disk and halo gas) and known for strong\nextraplanar emission in radio continuum, optical lines, and soft X-rays (SXR). Thus, they\nappear to be good candidates to search for evidence of galactic fountains. While the spectra\nof NGC 891 did not reveal any O VI emission, we detected the O VI doublet in NGC 4631.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThis is the first detection of O VI in emission in a spiral galaxy other than the Milky Way\nand its companions.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n2.1.\n\nNGC 4631\n\nWe obtained spectra with the low resolution aperture (30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032 ) of FUSE at two\npositions above the disk of NGC 4631 (see Figure 1) as part of Project P134. Position A is\nat the peak of the 1/4 keV X-ray emission detected by Wang et al. (1995) using ROSAT.\nPosition B is between two H\u03b1 arcs that were believed to form the walls of an open chimney\ninto the halo (Rand, Kulkarni, & Hester 1992), although a recent Hubble Space Telescope\nH\u03b1 image (Wang et al. 2001) indicates that this feature may be a superposition of several\nloops. All FUSE observations were conducted in TTAG mode where the detectors record\nthe arrival time, x- and y-position, and the pulse height of each event (Sahnow et al. 2000).\nAbout 2/3 of each observation was conducted during orbital night.\nThe O VI lines in the NGC 4631 spectra were extracted from the raw data files. Only\nevents with a pulse height between 4 and 15, inclusive, were used in the analysis. Nearby O I\nairglow lines were used to determine the height of the extraction windows, and the spectra\nwere summed perpendicular to the dispersion direction. Emission free regions adjacent to\nthe O VI lines in the dispersion direction were used to determine the background.\nFigure 2 shows a plot of the extracted spectra for both pointings toward NGC 4631.\nThe wavelength scale was determined by running the spectra through the FUSE data\npipeline V2.0.5. Its uncertainty is about one pixel (0.007 \u00c5). Both the redshifted 1032 \u00c5\nand 1038 \u00c5 line were detected on the LiF1A channel. However, the latter was blended with\nthe O I \u03bb\u03bb 1039.23,1040.94,1041.69 airglow triplet. The background at wavelengths > 1040 \u00c5\nwas increased due to a stripe of scattered light within the satellite. The O VI emission lines\nwere also seen on the LiF2B segment for Position B; however, the lower effective area significantly reduced the quality of the data. Therefore, we have used only data from the 1032 \u00c5\nemission line of segment LiF1A in the analysis.\nA comparison of day-plus-night versus night-only data yielded the same flux in the\nO VI \u03bb1032 line and therefore ruled out the possibility that the emission arose from scattered\nsolar O VI emission in the LiF channels. Deep integrations towards other lines of sight ruled\nout detector artifacts, scattered light, and stray light contamination at the positions of the\ndetected lines. The background was not significantly higher during the sunlit portion of\nthe orbit; therefore, we have used the combined day and night data in our analysis. The\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nresulting signal-to-noise ratios for the integrated O VI \u03bb1032 intensities are 4.5 (Position A)\nand 6.0 (Position B).\n\n2.2.\n\nNGC 891\n\nThe data for NGC 891 were obtained as part of FUSE Guest Investigator Cycle 2 program B114. Two positions below the disk and one position above the bulge of NGC 891\n(see Figure 3) were observed. The data reduction was identical to the data reduction for\nNGC 4631 above. Approximately 85% of the observations were conducted during the night\nportion of the orbit. The observational data for both galaxies are listed in Table 1. Given\nthe large random errors in the intensities of NGC 891, we do not believe that any of these\ndetections are significant.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nRESULTS\nNGC 4631\n\nNGC 4631 is an Sc/SBd type galaxy at a distance of about 7.6 Mpc with an inclination\nof i \u2248 85\u25e6 . The interaction between NGC 4631 and its two neighboring galaxies NGC 4656\nand NGC 4627 might have triggered the active star formation observed in NGC 4631 today.\nThe galaxy possesses a complex system of H\u03b1 filaments and bubbles (Wang et al. 2001) and\nan extended radio halo with spurs up to 10 kpc above the disk (Hummel & Dettmar 1990).\nX-ray observations of NGC 4631 revealed a SXR bubble on the north side of the disk (Wang\net al. 1995) and a halo of gas extending up to 8 kpc above the plane with temperatures of\n(2 \u2212 7) \u00d7 106 K (Wang et al. 2001). Both the radio and the X-ray halo appear asymmetric\nwith the larger extent being on the north side of the disk.\nThe two FUSE pointings for NGC 4631 were chosen to lie within the SXR bubble observed with ROSAT (Wang et al. 1995, see Figure 1). Assuming an effective area of 27.0 cm2\nfor the LiF1A segment and 900 arcs2 for the aperture area, we derive O VI \u03bb1032 intensities of 4600 \u00b1 1000 photons s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 (Position A) and 8000 \u00b1 1300 photons s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121\n(Position B). Table 2 lists the intensities (also converted to ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 ) and the corresponding height above the disk. The O VI \u03bb1032 intensity at Position B is a factor of five\nsmaller than the 2 \u03c3 upper limit of Ferguson et al. (1995), who observed the southern portion\nof the galaxy with the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope on the Astro-2 mission. The full extent\nof the O VI emitting gas is unknown. However, it is useful to consider two cases. In the first\nscenario, the O VI emission is confined to the region of the SXR bubble on the north side of\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthe disk. On the other hand, the O VI emission may extend across the full hot halo revealed\nby the Chandra observations of Wang et al. (2001). The former would correspond to a single large bubble breaking out into the halo, while the latter implies a full galactic fountain.\nTherefore, we will calculate the luminosity for both cases assuming that the average O VI surface brightness is equivalent to the average of Positions A and B. The O VI \u03bb1032/O VI \u03bb1038\nline ratio approaches two in optically thin gas and is reduced in optically thick gas due to\nself-absorption. We assumed the upper limit for this line ratio of 2 in order to account for\nthe O VI \u03bb1038 emission in our calculations. Ignoring extinction (see below) we calculated a\nlower limit for the total O VI luminosity of LOVI = (6.2 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 for the bubble\nand LOVI = (2.3 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 1039 ergs s\u22121 for the entire halo.\n\n3.1.1. Correction for Extinction\nThe Milky Way extinction toward NGC 4631 is E(B \u2212V ) = 0.017 (Schlegel, Finkbeiner,\n& Davis 1998). Using a Galactic extinction curve by Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis (1989), we\nderived an optical depth \u03c4 = 0.25, i.e. the UV flux is attenuated by a factor of 1.28. The\ncorrected values for the luminosities are LOVI = (7.9 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 for the bubble\nand LOVI = (3.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 1039 ergs s\u22121 for the entire halo. The amount of extinction within\nNGC 4631 is uncertain. Long slit optical spectroscopy of the Balmer lines by Martin & Kern\n(2001) has revealed evidence for significant and patchy extinction due to dust in the halo of\nNGC 4631 up to 5 kpc from the plane. However, another group found almost no extinction\nat a height of > 1 kpc on the northern side of the disk (Otte et al. 2001). We obtained long\nslit spectra of NGC 4631 with the 2.3 m Steward Observatory on Kitt Peak, Arizona, on\n2002 April 7\u20139. The slit was about 4.\u2032\u2032 5 wide and orientated north-south to cross both FUSE\npositions. The measured H\u03b1/H\u03b2 line ratios are comparable to those measured by Otte et\nal. (2001). We therefore assume that extinction within the halo of NGC 4631 is negligible.\n\n3.1.2. Comparison with X-ray Luminosity\nAs mentioned earlier, the O VI emission is an important coolant for hot ionized gas. In\nfact, for gas in heating-cooling equilibrium, the O VI emission cooling at intermediate temperatures (few \u00d7105 K) should dominate the radiative cooling in the SXR emission of 106 K\ngas (Sutherland & Dopita 1993). The SXR intensities in the 0.1 \u2212 2 keV range measured by\nChandra and integrated over the area of the FUSE positions are 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121\n(Position A) and 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 (Position B) yielding SXR/O VI ratios of\n1.2 \u00b1 0.3 and 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 for Positions A and B, i.e. the intensities are more or less comparable\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nbetween the O VI doublet and the SXR emission. However, the used O VI \u03bb\u03bb1032,1038 emission was a lower limit (see paragraph 3.1) and not corrected for Galactic extinction (because\nwe did not know the Galactic extinction for the SXR emission); the SXR/O VI ratios did\nnot account for any dust in NGC 4631 either. Thus, the quoted ratios are probably lower\nlimits suggesting that the gas is not in equilibrium.\nThe total O VI luminosity (corrected for Galactic extinction, see paragraph 3.1.1), if\nassumed to cover the whole halo of NGC 4631, is by a factor of 9 lower than the two component fit of the X-ray luminosity (2.7 \u00d7 1040 ergs s\u22121 , Wang et al. 1995, corrected for\ndifferent distances). The corresponding temperature of this X-ray luminosity was approximately 6 \u00d7 105 K, i.e. a temperature about twice as high as the one for the peak of the O VI\ncooling curve. This again implies that the gas is not cooling efficiently in O VI, i.e. it is not\nin equilibrium. However, the uncertainties here are higher than for the comparison above, as\nwe now have compared observational data with a model using different simplifications (e.g.\nfor the shape and extent of the emitting halo).\nWang et al. (1995) estimated that the mechanical energy input from supernovae is about\n(1.5 \u2212 15) \u00d7 1041 ergs s\u22121 , i.e. the observed O VI luminosity can account for at most \u223c 2 %\nof the total energy input from supernovae. If the gas is in equilibrium, then the remaining\nenergy input has to be used to transport the gas from the disk into the halo against the\ngravitational potential of the galaxy and against the pressure of the magnetic field lines\nand is partially lost due to cooling of \u223c 106 K hot gas by species other than oxygen. From\nthe cooling flow models of Edgar & Chevalier (1986), we calculate that the full halo case is\nequivalent to a mass flux of 2.8 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for cooling at constant density and 1.8 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for\ncooling at constant pressure. In case of a single cooling bubble the corresponding mass fluxes\nare 0.74 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (isochoric) and 0.48 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (isobaric). A rough estimate for the mass flux\nderived from ROSAT observations is \u223c 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Wang et al. 1995). Despite the large\nuncertainties due to unknown extinction and the differences in the cooling models, the data\nsuggest that the O VI emitting region is larger than the SXR bubble, but smaller (within a\nfactor of \u223c 2) than the X-ray halo observed with Chandra. This means that outflows are more\nsignificant in the central region of the galaxy, as indicated by the filamentary structure in the\nH\u03b1 image (Wang et al. 2001). If, in fact, there was strong, patchy extinction along our lines of\nsight, the actual O VI luminosities could be much higher than the observed luminosities and\ncould account for a significant fraction of the input energy from supernovae. On the other\nhand, if the O VI emission originated in the interface between cold clouds moving through\nthe hot coronal gas, the relationship between SXR and O VI emission would become more\ncomplicated.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.1.3. Rotation Velocity\nWe fitted the observed O VI \u03bb1032 emission line by a convolution of a tophat (106 km s\u22121\nwide to represent the filled FUSE 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032 square aperture) and a Gaussian profile (to\nrepresent the spectral resolution of FUSE). We used \u03c72 calculations to determine the best\ncentral wavelengths and intrinsic velocity dispersions for the emission lines at Positions A\nand B. In order to estimate 1 \u03c3 uncertainties for these parameters, we varied each parameter\nindependently until the corresponding minimum \u03c72 increased by 1 relative to the best fit \u03c72 .\nThe derived values are \u03bbc = 1034.30 \u00b1 0.09 \u00c5 and FWHM = 200 \u00b1 50 km s\u22121 for Position A\nand \u03bbc = 1034.37 \u00b1 0.08 \u00c5 and FWHM = 170 \u00b1 50 km s\u22121 for Position B. The corresponding\nradial velocities (geocentric) are v = 690 \u00b1 30 km s\u22121 (Position A) and 710 \u00b1 20 km s\u22121\n(Position B). An offset of \u22129.1 and \u22129.5 km s\u22121 , respectively, yields local standard of rest\nvelocities. If the O VI emitting gas does not fill the LWRS aperture and is not centered\nin it, the maximum additional offset in the line centroid is 50 km s\u22121 (for a point source\nat the border of the aperture). The line broadening due to the satellite's orbital motion is\n< 8 km s\u22121 , i.e. well within the uncertainties of the FWHM.\nThe intrinsic FWHMs, if assumed to be thermal widths, correspond to temperatures of\n(1.4 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 107 K (Position A) and (1.0 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 107 K (Position B). These temperatures\nare an order of magnitude higher than the hottest component of the SXR emission. This\nsuggests that the line widths are caused by turbulent motion or differential rotation rather\nthan thermal motion. From position-velocity diagrams (Rand 1994), one can expect an\noffset of about 50\u2013100 km s\u22121 between the systemic velocity (606 km s\u22121 ) and the velocity of\ngas corotating in the disk at the distances of the FUSE positions projected onto the major\naxis. A combination of the size of the low resolution aperture (30\u2032\u2032 or about 1.1 kpc) and\ndifferential rotation yields a velocity dispersion of up to 200 km s\u22121 in the galactic plane\nnear the center. The O VI velocity centroids and FWHMs closely match those of the H I\ngas in the disk of NGC 4631. Thus, the line-of-sight component of the motion of the O VI\nemitting gas appears to follow the rotation of the underlying disk gas. Due to the galaxy's\nhigh inclination, the velocity of the O VI emitting gas perpendicular to the disk is unknown.\nAlthough not conclusive, this strong relationship to the disk gas implies that the O VI\nemitting material originated in the disk.\n\n3.1.4. Scale Height\nIf the gas has an exponential distribution in the vertical direction above the disk, we\ncan calculate the density scale height of the gas from the two observations at Positions A\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nand B using:\nh=\n\n\u22122(zA \u2212 zB )\nln( IIAB )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere zA and zB are the vertical heights of the projected aperture above the plane of the\ngalaxy, and IA and IB are the measured specific intensities at Positions A and B, respectively.\nThe 2 in Equation 1 results from the fact that the intensity is proportional to the square of\nthe density. Using the intensities and z heights from Table 2, we find\nh = 8.3 \u00b1 4.1 kpc.\n\n(2)\n\nThe large uncertainty in the density scale height results from the large uncertainties in\nthe measured specific intensities at Positions A and B. However, it appears that the scale\nheight of O VI gas in NGC 4631 is significantly larger than the 2.3 kpc scale height found\nby Savage et al. (2003) for the Milky Way. Using the intensities from paragraph 3.1.2, we\nfind a scale height of about 6.6 kpc for the SXR emission in NGC 4631, whereas Hummel,\nBeck, & Dahlem (1991) reported a scale height of about 8 kpc for the magnetic field. Scale\nheights derived from optical emission lines range between 0.9 and 1.2 kpc, not considering the\nroughly constant intensity at z > 3 kpc (Martin & Kern 2001). Given the uncertainties, the\nscale heights of the O VI and SXR emission and the magnetic field appear to be comparable.\n\n3.2.\n\nNGC 891\n\nThe Sb spiral galaxy NGC 891 is at a distance of about 9.6 Mpc with an inclination of\ni \u2265 88.6\u25e6 (Rupen et al. 1987). We observed three positions in the halo of NGC 891 and did\nnot detect O VI in emission to a level greater than 3\u03c3 (Fig. 4). The 3\u03c3 intensity limits can\nbe obtained from Table 2. The Milky Way extinction in this direction is E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.065\n(Schlegel et al. 1998). Assuming a standard interstellar extinction curve (Cardelli et al.\n1989), the UV flux is attenuated by a factor of 2.4 (\u03c4 = 0.88). If we assume that the O VI\nemitting halo of NGC 891 is the same size as the X-ray emitting halo seen by Bregman\n& Pildis (1994), and that the average specific intensity of the halo in NGC 891 is equal\nto the average at Positions 1 and 2, then the upper limit to the O VI \u03bb1032 luminosity is\nL1032 < 7.5 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 . Bregman & Houck (1997) found that the SXR (0.1\u20132.5 keV)\nband luminosity is 2.45 \u00d7 1039 ergs s\u22121 with a cooling rate of 0.08 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (corrected for\nd = 9.6 Mpc). This predicts an O VI \u03bb1032 luminosity (Edgar & Chevalier 1986) of 5.7 \u00d7\n1037 ergs s\u22121 (isochoric) and 8.8 \u00d7 1037 ergs s\u22121 (isobaric), well within our limits. We have not\nattempted any correction for extinction in the halo of NGC 891 itself.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n4.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nNGC 4631 has a stronger radio halo than NGC 891, but a comparable far-IR luminosity.\nRand, Kulkarni, & Hester (1992) concluded from these observations that NGC 4631 probably\nhas a larger star formation rate than NGC 891. The Hubble Space Telescope images of Wang\net al. (2001) clearly show loops, arcs, and filaments as would be expected from galactic\nchimneys. ROSAT observations (Wang et al. 1995) revealed the presence of a large region\nof SXR emission directly above the arcs and filaments, indicating that some of the hot\nsupernovae gas has vented into the halo. In this paper, we reported the detection of O VI\nemission at two locations above the arcs at the peaks of the SXR emission with a line-of-sight\nvelocity similar to the disk gas and a FWHM broader than what might be expected from\nthermal motions of hot gas. The observation of O VI emitting gas suggests that the hot gas\noriginated in the disk and is cooling. Due to the large uncertainties in the O VI intensities\nand luminosities and the range in the luminosities and mass flux rates predicted by cooling\nflow models, it is not clear whether the cooling flow in NGC 4631 is (yet) in equilibrium\nwith the mass flux derived from X-ray observations. However, given all this evidence, we\nbelieve that, because of its edge-on nature, NGC 4631 is the first spiral galaxy in which O VI\nhas been detected in emission unambiguously from the galactic halo and in which all the\nexpected components for a full cycle of gas in a galactic fountain have been observed. The\nlack of reliable O VI measurements for NGC 891 is likely explained with the large foreground\nextinction of the Milky Way and the amount of dust in NGC 891 itself. The O VI luminosities\npredicted from cooling flow models are well within our 3\u03c3 limits for NGC 891.\nThe NGC 4631 data were obtained for the Guaranteed Time Team by the NASA-CNESCSA FUSE mission operated by the Johns Hopkins University.
