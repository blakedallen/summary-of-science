These results are then applied to the analysis of\nthe amplification of the primordial magnetic induction in a curved background of\nFriedmann's geometry.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe original version of the Dirac's AEther was presented long ago as a result following\nhis formulation of the so-called \"New Electrodynamics\" (NE) [1]. In the NE, Dirac has\nadopted a radical approach for the discussion of a classical electron in the presence of an\nelectromagnetic field. The main idea was to use the spurious degrees of freedom associated\nto the gauge potential to describe the electron. In [1] Dirac showed how this could be\ndone by a judicious choice of gauge condition, e.g. A2 = k 2 . In fact, introducing this as a\ngauge fixing term in the Lagrangian 1 L = \u2212 41 F 2 + \u03bb2 (A2 \u2212\u03ba2 ), we find \u2202\u03bd F \u03bd\u03bc = J \u03bc \u2261 \u03bbA\u03bc .\nTherefore, we obtain a four current depending on A\u03bc that is suitable for the description of\na classical electron interacting with an electromagnetic field. In this approach we observe\nthat the gauge condition doesn't intend to eliminate spurious degrees of freedom of the\ngauge potential. Instead of that, it acquires a deep physical meaning as the condition\nthat allow us to describe the right physics without having to introduce any extra fields.\nOne of the striking consequences of these results were discussed in a subsequent paper\nof Dirac [2] and led to the AEther model. In fact, by using quantum mechanical arguments\nDirac argued it would be possible to consider an aether provided we interpret its four\nvelocity v at each point as a quantity subjected to uncertainty relations. Then, the aether\nfour velocity instead of being a well-defined quantity, would rather be probabilisticaly\ndistributed over a range of values. The wave function describing the aether would be such\n1\n\nWith \u03bb a lagrange multiplier and k a constant.\n\n2\n\n\fas to assure a velocity distribution with all velocities being equally probable. Admitting\nthe aether velocity as defining a point in a hyperboloid with equation v02 \u2212 ~v 2 = 1, v0 > 0,\nDirac could relate it to the gauge potential (satisfying A2 = k 2 ) by k1 A\u03bc = v\u03bc and from\nthe interpretation given to the NE, he concluded that v would be the velocity an electric\ncharge would flow if placed in the aether. The four velocity v, being defined through all\npoints of spacetime, justify its interpretation as a meaningful physical quantity, the aether\nvelocity.\nFollowing Dirac, many authors have tried to develop a realistic model for the Dirac's\nAEther by considering the aether as a vacuum with conductivity \u03c3 \u2248 10\u221213 /s [3, 4]. They\nhave also found the photon as having a non-null mass m\u03b3 = \u03c3h/c2 \u2248 10\u221248 g (which is\nbelow laboratories estimates for the limit of the photon mass). In these models, the basic\nequations for the aether were the Maxwell equations in a conducting medium without\n~ and the magnetic\ndensity of charge and current. The intensity of the electric field E,\n~\ninduction B\n\n2\n\n~ and the magnetic intensity H\n~\nare related to the electric displacement D,\n\n~ = \u01ebE,\n~ H\n~ = 1B\n~ which suppose the aether as a homogeneous medium\nby the relations D\n\u03bc\npolarized isotropically and linearly. Besides that, it is implicit in [3, 4] that all their\nanalysis is considered in a flat spacetime and from a reference frame at rest relative to\nthe aether.\nOur present work is a continuation of an investigation initiated in a preceding paper [5]\nwhere we have studied the amplification of the cosmic magnetic induction for the Proca\nelectromagnetic field in the Dirac's AEther. There the equations used were the Proca's\nequations in a conducting media. Here, we wish to study the Dirac's model from another\npoint of view, extending his original idea but maintaining the physical motivation for the\napplication in a curved background. One of our interests is to analyse how the primordial\ncosmic magnetic induction has been amplified, as the Universe evolves, for a model that\nis neither Proca nor the purely Maxwell electrodynamics (but that includes this last\none as a particular case). In the literature of the Dirac's AEther, none of the models\npresented in [3, 4, 6] discusses a possible framework for the study of electromagnetic\n2\n\n~ and the magnetic induction B\n~ as simply\nHere we will also refer to the intensity of the electric field E\n\nelectric and magnetic field.\n\n3\n\n\fphenomena in the large scale structure. They all take for granted the basic Maxwell\ntheory. Therefore, any application to a large scale scenario is expected to be modeled\nwithin the Maxwell formulation. Since it is unknown if under the influence of a curved\nbackground the electromagnetic field presents a different behaviour than that foreseen by\nthe Maxwell theory, it is reasonable to test alternative approaches that may provide a\nsuitable description for the electromagnetic field at the large scale. Our model intends to\noffer such an alternative.\nAlthough we are not concerned with the relevant question about the structure of the\naether as a conducting medium [6], it is implict in our formulation that there is an inertial\nreference frame in which the aether is at rest and consequently the field of velocities of\n\u03bc\nthe points of the aether write as vaether\n= (1, 0, 0, 0). We refer it as the aether frame.\n\nThe main point of our research is based on the proposition of an action for the AEther\nof Dirac which may be able to reproduce some characteristics of previous models. We\npropose then the action S =\n\nR\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ndx \u2212 41 F 2 + \u03c3v\u03b1 F \u03b1\u03bc A\u03bc with v being the aether's velocity\n\n\u03bd\nrelative to a generic observer (inertial or not). For inertial observers, v \u03bc = \u039b\u03bc\u03bd vaether\n= \u039b\u03bc0\n3\n\nis still constant and we obtain from the equations of motion a four-current in the form\n\nJ \u03bc = \u2212\u03c3v \u03bc \u2202.A + \u03c3v\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd , that is understood as being induced in the aether by the\npresence of the electromagnetic field. Therefore, it defines a polarization tensor M\u03b1\u03b2 from\nwhich we obtain the vectors of polarization and magnetization of the medium. We will\nsee in section 2.4 that in the aether reference frame the form assumed by this 4-current\n~ = E\n~ + \u03c3A\n~ while the magnetic\nallow us to define the electric displacement vector as D\n~ = B,\n~ with the resulting equations being\nintensity coincides with the magnetic field, H\nsimilar in form with the macroscopic Maxwell equations in a medium. This coincides with\n~ 6= \u01ebE.\n~ This shows that in our\nthe results of [3, 4] but with a particular difference: D\nmodel the aether cannot be thought of as an isotropic medium. Moreover, in a generic\n~ and\nreference frame moving relative to the aether, the vectors of electric displacement D\n~ will depend on v. Our treatment offers an extension of the results\nmagnetic intensity H\nof [3, 4] in the sense that our equations incorporate the situation of reference frames that\nare not at rest relative to the aether.\n3\n\nwith \u039b the Lorentz transformation relating the observer and the aether frame.\n\n4\n\n\f~ and B\n~ which are\nIn our approach the basic electromagnetic fields are the vectors E\ncomponents of the tensor F\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212\u2202\u03bd A\u03bc . The equations of motion (3) are determined\ndirectly from our action, with the Jacobi identity F\u03bc\u03bd,\u03b1 + F\u03bd\u03b1,\u03bc + F\u03b1\u03bc,\u03bd = 0 completing\nthe set of equations involving the electromagnetic field. In the traditional formulation\nof classical electrodynamics the non-homogeneous Maxwell equations in a conducting\n~ and H\n~ which\nmedium are obtained introducing a second tensor H \u03bc\u03bd with components D\nsatisfy \u2202\u03bc H \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212j \u03bd . Compared to our formalism we don't have to introduce by hand\nany tensor H \u03bc\u03bd . Here it is the interaction term v\u03b1 F \u03b1\u03bc A\u03bc that forces the appearance\n~ and B\n~ which allow us\nof additional terms (depending on A\u03bc ) in the equations for E\n~ and H.\n~ Both the classical electrodynamics in vacuo (31-34) and in\nto identify as D\nconducting media (35-38) are obtained as a particular case of our model for an observer\nthat is at rest relative to the aether. For observers that move slowly relative to the aether\nand/or for phenomena in which the aether conductivity is sufficiently small we are expected\nto have the interaction term giving a small contribution to the Maxwell equations and\ntherefore the model may qualitatively agree with the same predictions of the traditional\nformulation of classical electrodynamics.\nThis work is organized as follows. Considering an observer moving with constant\nvelocity relative to the aether, in Section 2.1 we discuss the lagrangian of the model,\nidentify the 4-current and a constraint that appears associated to its conservation; in\nSection 2.2 we analyse a global gauge invariance of the action, we show that in the aether\nframe the conservation of the Noether charge coincides with the Gauss law, we interpret\nthe interaction term v\u03b1 F \u03b1\u03bc A\u03bc as J \u0303 * A with J \u0303\u03bc \u2261 v\u03b1 F \u03b1\u03bc a conserved 4-current, and we\npropose a mass term that preserves the global symmetry; in Section 2.3 we show that our\naction admits a local gauge invariance; in Section 2.4 we show that in the aether frame we\n~ =E\n~ + \u03c3A\n~ and H\n~ = B.\n~ Considering the\nobtain macroscopic Maxwell equations with D\ncase of a curved background we will have, in general, v 6= cte; in Section 3 we establish\nthe material relations involving the fields; in Section 4 the equations of the model in a\ncosmological background are solved and the solutions are discussed.

Here, the term\nJ \u0303 * A defines an interaction of the gauge field with itself.\nThe equation of motion for A\u03bc has the form\n\u2202\u03bd F \u03bd\u03bc + \u03c3v \u03bc \u2202.A \u2212 \u03c3v\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd = 0\n\n(3)\n\nand it assumes the same form as the Maxwell equations in the presence of a source\n\u2202\u03bd F \u03bd\u03bc \u2261 J \u03bc\n\n6\n\n(4)\n\n\fprovided we identify\nJ \u03bc = \u2212\u03c3v \u03bc \u2202.A + \u03c3v\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd\n\n(5)\n\nwith a conserved 4-current. This interpretation follows the same idea of Dirac's NE [1] in\n.\nwhich the term j \u03bc = \u03bbA\u03bc was interpreted as a 4-current. However, in Dirac's formalism\nthe appearance of this 4-current originates from the introduction of a gauge fixing term\n1\n\u03bb(A2\n2\n\n\u2212 k 2 ) in the action while in our approach J \u03bc , given in (5), arises from the presence\n\n \u0303\nof the interaction term J.A.\n\nNow, taking the divergence of (4) we obtain 0 = \u2202\u03bc J \u03bc = \u03c3v\u03bc (\u2737A\u03bc \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc \u2202.A) =\n\u03c3v\u03bc \u2202\u03bd F \u03bd\u03bc = \u03c3v\u03bc J \u03bc = \u03c3 2 (\u2212v 2 \u2202.A + v\u03b1 v\u03b2 \u2202 \u03b1 A\u03b2 ), i.e\n\u2202.A =\n\nv\u03b1 v\u03b2 \u03b1 \u03b2\n\u2202 A .\nv2\n\n(6)\n\nThis constraint is a new feature of our model and since it involves the divergence of A it\nresembles a kind of gauge condition. Nonetheless, its origin is independent of any local\nsymmetry of the action. In section 2.3 we will analyse how this condition combines with\na local symmetry of the action imposing certain conditions to be satisfied by the gauge\nparameter.\n\n2.2\n\nGlobal Gauge Invariance\n\nThe first invariance of the action we want to analize is the one defined by a transformation\nparametrized by a global parameter \u03bb (\u2202\u03bc \u03bb = 0) and having the form\nA\u03bc \u2192 A\u2032\u03bc = A\u03bc + \u03bbv\u03bc .\n\n(7)\n\nAssociated to this symmetry we have the following Noether current\n\u0398\u03bc = F \u03bc\u03bd v\u03bd \u2212 \u03c3v \u03bc A.v + \u03c3v 2 A\u03bc \u2261 \u0398\u03bc\u03bd v\u03bd\n\n(8)\n\n.\n\u0398\u03bc\u03bd = F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03c3v \u03bc A\u03bd + \u03c3v \u03bd A\u03bc .\n\n(9)\n\nwith\n\nIn section 3 the quantitity \u0398\u03bc\u03bd will be interpreted as the tensor H \u03bc\u03bd , which in the aether\n~ H).\n~ In this general case, it will be clear how H \u03bc\u03bd depends on\nframe becomes H \u03bc\u03bd = (D,\n7\n\n\fthe properties of the medium and on the 4-velocity v. In a system that is at rest relative\nto the aether we have\n~ + \u03c3 A)\n~\n\u0398\u03bc = (0, E\n\n(10)\n\n~ A\n~ = 0. Therefore, the conservation equation of \u0398\u03bc let us with\nand condition (6) gives \u2207.\n~ E\n~ =0.\n\u2207.\n\n(11)\n\nIn our model, there is another conserved current that has the form\nJ\u02c6\u03bc = \u2212\u03c3v \u03bc \u2202.A + \u03c3v.\u2202A\u03bc\n\n(12)\n\nand from which we obtain J \u0303 = J\u02c6 \u2212 J. Then, conservation of J \u0303 follows immediately as\nthe difference of two conserved currents. Equivalently, from (9) we can also think of J \u0303\u03bd\nas originating from the divergence of \u0398\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u2202\u03bc \u0398\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212J \u0303\u03bd .\n\n(13)\n\nIn the classical formulation of Electrodynamics in conducting media the non-homogeneous\nMaxwell equations are written covariantly as\n\u03bd\n\u2202\u03bc H \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212jext\n\n(14)\n\n~ and H\n~ as its components. In our model \u0398\u03bc\u03bd (9) generalizes\nwith the tensor H \u03bc\u03bd having D\nthe tensor H \u03bc\u03bd and equation (13) corresponds to (14). Then this allow us to interpret J \u0303\u03bc\nas the corresponding 4-current of our model, in much the same way as Dirac interpreted\nj\u03bc = \u03bbA\u03bc as a 4-current in [1]. The interaction term J \u0303 * A in our action (1) parallels then\nthe same interaction term of the usual electrodynamics.\nThe global symmetry (7) is a new feature of our model that has no similar counterpart\nin the usual Maxwell formulation. It is also possible to add a mass term to the action (1)\nthat perserves this global symmetry. In fact, the action\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u0010 1\n\u0011\n1\ndx \u2212 F 2 + J \u0303 * A \u2212 \u03c3 2 A\u03bc (v 2 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 v \u03bc v \u03bd )A\u03bd\n4\n2\n\n(15)\n\nis invariant by (7). From (15) we obtain the following equation\n\u03bc .\n\u2202\u03bd F \u03bd\u03bc \u2261 J = \u2212\u03c3v \u03bc \u2202.A + \u03c3v\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd + \u03c3 2 (v 2 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 v \u03bc v \u03bd )A\u03bd\n\n8\n\n(16)\n\n\for equivalently\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd (\u2737 \u2212 \u03c3 2 v 2 ) \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc \u2202 \u03bd + \u03c3(v \u03bc \u2202 \u03bd \u2212 v \u03bd \u2202 \u03bc ) + \u03c3 2 v \u03bc v \u03bd A\u03bd = 0 .\n\n(17)\n\n\u03bc\n\nHere the conservation of the current J that follows from (16) doesn't produce any constraint over A. We also notice that associated to the global symmetry we have the same\nconserved current (8).\n\n2.3\n\nLocal Gauge Invariance\n\nThe local gauge invariance depends on a parameter \u03b8(x) and assumes the usual form\nA\u03bc \u2192 A\u2032\u03bc = A\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u03b8 .\n\n(18)\n\nHere, condition (6) adds new features to our analysis. In fact, let A\u2032 and A be two fields\nrelated by (18). Since both field configurations should obey (6) we must have\n\u2202.A\u2032 =\n\n1\nv\u03b1 v\u03b2\n(v.\u2202)(v.A\u2032 ) \u21c0\n\u21bd \u2737\u03b8 = 2 \u2202 \u03b1 \u2202 \u03b2 \u03b8 .\n2\nv\nv\n\n(19)\n\nConsider that \u2202.A 6= 0 and let us choose \u03b8 such that it ensures \u2202.A\u2032 = 0. We should then\nhave \u03b8 satisfying\n\u2737\u03b8 = \u2212\u2202.A .\n\n(20)\n\nThis last condition together with the constraints (6,19) gives\n1\n\u2202 \u03b1 \u2202 \u03b2 \u03b8 = \u2212 (\u2202 \u03b1 A\u03b2 + \u2202 \u03b2 A\u03b1 )\n2\n\n(21)\n\nthat represents a restriction stronger than that shown in (20). Equivalently, we can obtain\nequation (21) directly from 0 = \u2202.A\u2032 =\n\n2.4\n\nva v\u03b2 \u03b1\n\u2202 (A\u03b2\nv2\n\n+ \u2202 \u03b2 \u03b8) by using (6).\n\nElectrodynamics in the AEther's Reference Frame\n\nLet us analyse our model in the aether reference frame. We have v = (1, 0, 0, 0). We also\nsuppose the aether as a medium without any given density of charge or current. From (4)\nwe obtain the following equations\n~ E\n~ = \u2212\u03c3 \u2207.\n~ A\n~\n\u2207.\n~\n~\n~ \u00d7B\n~ = \u2202E + \u03c3 \u2202A + \u03c3E\n~\n\u2207\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n9\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\n\fto which we add the homogeneous equations\n~ B\n~ = 0\n\u2207.\n\n~\n~ \u00d7E\n~ = \u2212 \u2202B .\n\u2207\n\u2202t\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\n~ E\n~ 6= 0, we have that (22) introduces a new feature for the physical vacuum. A\nSince \u2207.\nsimilar situation has been observed in the extended electromagnetism of [7]. Essentially,\n~ signalizes that the vacuum is not merely an empty space\na divergenceless equation for E\nbut it is also subjected to become electrically polarized. The presence of additional terms\ndepending on the potential vector in (22, 23) is understood as signalizing the response of\n~ B),\n~ a situation that resembles the phenomena\nthe medium to the presence of the fields (E,\nof polarization and magnetization of a medium. Therefore, we rewrite (22) as\n~ D\n~ =0\n\u2207.\n\n(26)\n\n. ~\n~ =\n~+\u2207\n~ \u00d7 K.\n~ At this point, K\n~ is an arbitrary vector that can be thought\nwith D\nE + \u03c3A\nof as playing a similar role of a gauge parameter. Now, we rewrite (23) as\n~\n~ \u00d7K\n~\n~\u2212 \u2202\u2207\n~ \u00d7B\n~ = \u2202D + \u03c3E\n\u2207\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n(27)\n\n~ such that it satisfies\nand we choose K\n\u2202 ~\n~ = \u03c3E\n~ .\n\u2207\u00d7K\n\u2202t\n\n(28)\n\n\u0011\n\u2202 ~ \u0010 ~ ~\n~ =0.\n\u2207 \u00d7 \u03c3A + \u2207 \u00d7 K\n\u2202t\n\n(29)\n\nThen, using (25) we obtain\n\n~ can be further restricted so that\nThe vector K\n~+\u2207\n~ \u00d7K\n~ =0.\n\u03c3A\n\n(30)\n\n~ =D\n~ and B\n~ =H\n~ and lead us to a set of equations\nThis gives E\n~ E\n~ = 0\n\u2207.\n\n~\n~ \u00d7B\n~ = \u2202E\n\u2207\n\u2202t\n~\n~\n\u2207.B = 0\n\n~\n~ \u00d7E\n~ = \u2212 \u2202B\n\u2207\n\u2202t\n10\n\n(31)\n(32)\n(33)\n(34)\n\n\fthat correspond to the Maxwell equations in free space. Conditions (28,30) can be interpreted as originating from the imposition of the temporal gauge. In fact, together they\n~ 0 = 0 that is naturally satisfied if we put A0 = 0.\nimply \u2207A\nIt is possible to give another description for our electrodynamics without using this\n~ From (23) we can simply identify D\n~ =E\n~ + \u03c3 A,\n~ H\n~ =B\n~ that lead us to the\nvector K.\nfollowing equations\n~ D\n~ = 0\n\u2207.\n\n~\n~ \u00d7B\n~ = \u2202D + \u03c3E\n~\n\u2207\n\u2202t\n~ B\n~ = 0\n\u2207.\n~\n~ \u00d7E\n~ = \u2212 \u2202B\n\u2207\n\u2202t\n\n(35)\n(36)\n(37)\n(38)\n\n~ =\nthat coincides with the aether's equations obtained in [3, 4]. In the identification D\n~ + \u03c3 A,\n~ H\n~ =B\n~ the aether behaves like a medium that responds to the presence of the\nE\n~ We also have a current J~ = \u03c3 E\n~ which is\nelectric field by creating a polarization P~ = \u03c3 A.\nin agreement with our supposition of the aether as being a medium with conductivity \u03c3.\nAccording to Schwinger's idea of structureless vacuum [8], an electromagnetic field\ndisturbs the vacuum affecting its properties of homogeneity and isotropy. This is exactly\nthe situation we have obtained in our model, where the presence of an electromagnetic\n~ =\n~ that\nfield in a vacuum with conductivity \u03c3 produces a response of the medium (D\n6 \u01ebE)\nsignalizes its non-isotropy.\n\n3\n\nMaterial Relations Involving H \u03bc\u03bd and F\u03bc\u03bd\n\nIn section 2.4, we have obtained the following material relations\n~ = E\n~ + \u03c3A\n~\nD\n\n(39)\n\n~ = B\n~\nH\n\n(40)\n\nfor a flat spacetime and for the case of a reference frame at rest relative to the aether.\nIn the case of a curved spacetime and for a non-inertial reference frame moving relative\nto the aether, we are supposed to have a more complicated relation between H and F .\n11\n\n\fIndeed, the general form for the material relations between the tensors H \u03bc\u03bd and F\u03bc\u03bd in a\nmedium that is at rest in any reference frame with a metric g\u03b1\u03b2 has been established in\n[9] as:\n\u221a\n\n\u2212gH \u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212gg \u03b1\u03b3 g \u03b2\u03ba S\u03b3\u03bc S\u03ba\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(41)\n\nwhere the tensor S\u03b2\u03b1 characterizes the electromagnetic properties of the medium. For our\nlater purpose, it is convenient to rewrite (41) as\n\u221a\n\n\u2212gH \u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bc\n\u2212gg \u03b1\u03b3 g \u03b2\u03ba S\u03b3\u03ba\nA\u03bc\n\n(42)\n\n\u03bc\nwhere the third rank mixed tensor S\u03b3\u03ba\nrelates to S\u03b2\u03b1 by\n\u03bc\nS\u03b3\u03ba\n= (S\u03b3\u03bd S\u03ba\u03bc \u2212 S\u03b3\u03bc S\u03ba\u03bd )\u2202\u03bd .\n\n(43)\n\nAs an application of (41) it was shown in [9] that for the vacuum (considered from\nan inertial reference frame) the tensor S\u03b2\u03b1 assumes the form S\u03b2\u03b1 = \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1 and the mate\u221a\n\u221a\nrial equations become \u2212gH \u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212gg \u03b1\u03bc g \u03b2\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd which reproduces the usual equations\nof free electrodynamics in a curved background [10, 11]. Also, in the case of a linear\nisotropic medium that is at rest in an inertial reference frame the tensor S\u03b2\u03b1 is given by\n\u221a\n~ = \u01ebE\n~ and H\n~ = 1 B.\n~\nS00 = \u01eb \u03bc, S11 = S22 = S33 = \u221a1\u03bc and we obtain the usual relations D\n\u03bc\nfor the electrodynamics in a medium.\nIn our model, in order to define the tensor H \u03b1\u03b2 for a generic reference frame in a\ncurved background and to find a suitable material relation of the type (42) we should first\nfollow the procedure of section 2.4 that allow us to define H \u03bc\u03bd directly from the equation\nof motion for A\u03bc .

Finally, in order to\n\n\u03bc\nobtain the material equations for our model we extend definition (42) by allowing S\u03b1\u03b2\nto\n\nbe a generic operator not restricted by (43) but given by\n\u03bc\nS\u03b1\u03b2\n= \u03b4\u03b2\u03bc (\u2202\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c3v\u03b1 ) \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u03bc (\u2202\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c3v\u03b2 ) .\n\n(48)\n\n\u03bc\nHere, the tensor S\u03b1\u03b2\nmay contain not only electromagnetic properties of the medium (as\n\nit is the case of (43)) but also information about the reference frame (implicit in the\n~ i = \u221a\u2212gH i0 , H\n~ i = \u2212 1 \u01ebijk \u221a\u2212gH jk [9] and\nfour-velocity v\u03b1 ). Adopting the convention D\n2\nconsidering a flat spacetime we obtain (in the aether frame) from (42,48) the relations\ngiven in (39,40).\n\n4\n\nThe Dirac's AEther in a Curved Background\n\n4.1\n\nSome Questions on the Cosmic Magnetic Induction\n\nThe origin of the cosmic magnetic induction (CMI) is still unknown. In fact, until now\nno theory has completely succeeded on explaining the evolution of the CMI, from its\ngeneration in the early universe to our present time in galaxies, stars and probably in the\nextracluster medium. The standard dynamo action, for instance, has left many questions\nwithout answer [12, 13]. Recently, one special type of mechanism for the amplification of\nthe CMI has been studied in [5] where the amplification was understood as being caused\nby the expansion of the cosmological background. This new kind of theoretical preview\nwas called geometric amplification (GA) because the only agent responsible for this effect\nwas the scale geometric factor R(t). One of the advantages of this approach is that the\namplification can be an alternative for the standard mechanism recently contested in [12].\nThe radio emission of very distant cosmic objects determines an upper limit for the\nintensity of the CMI. According to the literature, in the extra-galatic medium the CMI is\n\n13\n\n\fsupposed to have an intensity less than 10\u221213 T 4 .\n\n4.2\n\nThe Model in the Friedmann's Geometries\n\nConsidering these ideas, we will now apply our model to a curved background. We will be\nparticularly interested on finding solutions for the CMI that may provide an explanation\nfor the amplification of this field from the initial value of \u2248 10\u221219 T to the suggested\nactual value of \u2248 10\u221213 T. Here, we will assume that the conductivity of Dirac's AEther is\n\u2248 10\u221219 /s.\nLet us take as coordinate system the cylindrical coordinates of Schr\u00f6dinger x\u03bc =\n(t; \u03c1, \u03c6, \u03b6) in a Friedmann cosmological background minimally coupled with the electromagnetic field.

These functions and the different scale factors are shown in\ntable 1.

Therefore, for the orthonormal basis we have\n4\n\nOther models have considered a generation of a primordial CMI of magnitude \u2248 10\u221221 T [12].\n\n14\n\n\fchosen, the non-null components of the fields E and cB are E\u03c6 = \u2212f \u0307u2 /R2 , cB\u03b6 =\n2f u u\u2032 /R2 5 . To study how the expansion of the Universe influences the time evolution\nof the electromagnetic field, it is appropriate to define the time dependent quantities E(t)\n\n\u2261 |E/u| = |f \u0307|/R2 and B(t) \u2261 |B/u\u2032| = 2|f |/(cR2) that for simplicity we will also refer as\nthe electric field and magnetic induction.\nIn a curved space-time with metric minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field we\nobtain from S the following equations\nF \u03bc\u03bd\n;\u03bc +\n\n\u03c3 \u03bc \u03bd\n(A v \u2212 A\u03bd v \u03bc ) ;\u03bc = J \u03bd\nc\n\n(51)\n\nwhere the semicolon denotes the covariant derivative, J \u03bd = (\u2212\u03c3/c)v\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd and v\u03bc = R(t) \u03b4\u03bc0\nthe four-velocity of the aether.\nHere we notice that our new equations (51) differ from the ones of our previous model\n[5] by the presence of a skew-symmetric term (A\u03bc v \u03bd \u2212A\u03bd v \u03bc ) ;\u03bc instead of the term (1/\u03bb2 )A\u03bd\n(that comes from the Proca term). In both cases, the qualitative behaviour of the new\nterm will be very similar to the one obtained in the Proca model as we can see after\ncomparing Table 3 below and the graphics of our preceding paper.\nFor \u03bd = 2 we have\n\u03c3\nf \u0308 + 4 kc \u2212 \u1e58 f = 0\nc\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n(52)\n\nand according to the geometry, we have to solve the equations below:\n\u03c3\nf \u0308 \u2212 \u03b1t f = 0 for kc = 0 ;\nc\n\u03c3\nf \u0308 + (4 \u2212 \u03b1 sin t) f = 0 for kc = +1 ;\nc\n\u03c3\nf \u0308 \u2212 (4 + \u03b1 sinh t) f = 0 for kc = \u22121 .\nc\n\n(53)\n\nWe assume an initial field of magnitude B(ti ) \u2248 10\u221221 T. Since our model should also\ncontain a weak initial electric field to be dissipated during the evolution of Universe, we\nshall assume the existence of an electric field of magnitude E(ti ) \u2248 10\u22124 V/m. These\nlimits are fixed in order to give, as a final result, a realistic value for the modulus of\n5\n\nThe dot means d/dt, the prime means d/d\u03c1, and c, in this section, is written explicitly as the light\n\nvelocity.\n\n15\n\n\fB(tf ) that agrees with the one established by the usual theory of the cosmic fields. These\ninitial values we have assumed don't perturb the gravitational field, as it is evident from\nsimple calculations which show the energy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic and\ngravitational field related by a factor above 1010 . These results then justify the minimal\ncoupling of these fields as a suitable framework to study the influence of the very strong\ngeometry of the Universe on the very weak electromagnetic phenomenon.\nUsing the same method employed in [5], we will integrate numerically equations (53)\nfrom the initial cosmic conformal time ti = 0.0890 to the final time tf = 1.6100. In\nstandard cosmology this range corresponds respectively to the final stage of the matterradiation coupling and our current epoch. We have obtained around 20, 000 points in the\nnumerical integration of which, in Table 2, we displayed only a small ensemble of these\npoints that can give us a qualitative view of the amplification phenomenon. These results\nTable 2: Some Numerical Data (F=Flat, E=Elliptic, H=Hyperbolic)\nt\n\n0.0890\n\n0.1000\n\n(F) log|E|\n\n-3.0004\n\n-3.1804 -4.7392 -6.2559 -8.0335 -8.0147\n\nlog|cB|\n(E) log|E|\nlog|cB|\n(H) log|E|\nlog|cB|\n\n0.2352\n\n0.5779\n\n1.5793\n\n1.6100\n\n-11.6993 -4.7811 -5.2158 -6.2569 -7.5110 -7.5378\n-2.9997\n\n-3.2035 -4.7034 -6.4784 -7.8183 -7.8333\n\n-11.6988 -4.8575 -5.2248 -6.3072 -8.6010 -8.7447\n-3.0009\n\n-3.2052 -4.6926 -6.2743 -8.1737 -8.2008\n\n-11.6999 -4.8591 -5.2266 -6.2841 -7.6994 -7.7205\n\nare very similar to the ones of our latter work [5]. In Table 3 we compared the initial and\nthe final value of the fields for each geometry. The data show the important amplification\nof the B field, which is very welcomed by astrophysicists, and the overall reduction of\nthe electric field. It should be noticed that these results are determined not only by the\nevolution of the function f (t), (which constrains the field equations) but also by the direct\ncontribution of the geometry as given by the scale factor, R(t), that is present in both\nmathematical expressions for E and B. It is the interchange between the gravitational\n16\n\n\fand electromagnetic fields that imposes, as the Universe evolves, the decreasing of the\nelectric field and the amplification of the B field.\nTable 3: The Reduction of E and the Amplification of B\n\n5\n\nGeometry\n\nE\n\nB\n\nFlat (kc = 0)\n\n\u00d710\u22125\n\n\u00d710+4\n\nElliptic, (kc = +1)\n\n\u00d710\u22125\n\n\u00d710+3\n\nHyperbolic, (kc = \u22121)\n\n\u00d710\u22125\n\n\u00d710+4\n\nConclusion\nOur model for the AEther of Dirac allow us to adapt our description to any observer, be\n\nit inertial or not. In the case of an observer at rest relative to the aether, in a flat spacetime,\nwe have obtained the same description of previous models [3, 4] but with different material\n~ H,\n~ E,\n~ B.\n~ This accounts for the fact that although the\nrelations involving the fields D,\naether is a medium with conductivity, the presence of an electromagnetic field disturbs its\nisotropy. The equations we have obtained in this case had the same form as the Maxwell\nequations in a conductive medium provided we adopted a certain \"gauge\" choice for the\n~ (28,30). Here we notice the same role of the gauge condition as in the original\nvector K\nwork of Dirac's NE [1], e.g. as a condition that determines a certain physics. In the case\nof a curved background, an observer with v\u03b1 = R(t)\u03b4\u03b10 will see the same phenomenon of\namplification of the magnetic induction and reduction of the electric intensity that had\nalready been observed in [5] in the context of a Proca electromagnetic field in a Dirac\naether.\nThe material relations between the polarization tensor and the gauge potential given\nin (41,48) shows that the tensor H \u03bc\u03bd is related to the electromagnetic properties of the\n\u03bc\nmedium (encoded into the tensor S\u03b1\u03b2\n) and the metric tensor. This raises an interesting\n\npicture of a mutual effect between the electromagnetic field and the geometry of the\nspacetime. In fact, if the GA describes how the expansion of the universe influences the\n17\n\n\felectromagnetic fields as a kind of geometric background effect that should be added to\nwell-established non-geometric effects, there is also the possibility for the electromagnetic\nfield to influence the expansion of the universe [14].\nThe geometric relations between the electromagnetic field and the metric tensor involves the scale factor R(t). The amplification of the field B in this case is determined by\nthe minimal coupling we adopted. In other coulplings between the electromagnetic and\nthe gravitational fields the interchange could be more rapid and/or more intense, as we\ncan see in [15]. Our results confirm once more the strict relations between the electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena. Furthermore, the model we elaborated for the\nDirac's AEther in a curved space-time sugests it can also be applied to the study of the\nelectromagnetism in the large scale structure of the Universe.\n\nReferences\n[1] P.
