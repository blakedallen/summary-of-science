Rather one needs to make extra assumptions \u2013 cosmology,\nsecond law of thermodynamics[1, 2, 3, 4], etc. \u2013 about the initial conditions or one\nsimply leaves it for the applicator of the theory to somehow himself manage to find\nout what the initial conditions are for the experiment he wants to describe with the\ntheory. It is, however, the intention of the series of articles [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] to which\nthis article belongs to set up assumptions telling the initial conditions in a way that\ncan be called that these initial condition assumptions are unified[10] with the part of\nthe theory describing the equations of motion and the particle content (the usually\nT.O.E.). Our unification may though be mainly a bit formal in as far as our main\npoint is to use in the Feynmann path integral an action which has both a real SR\nand an imaginary part SI . Usually of course the action is real and the imaginary\npart SI = 0 (Total S = SR + iSI ). We may quickly see that the imaginary part\ngives a typically hugely different extra factor in the probability for different paths\nobeying equations of motion. Thus such an imaginary part essentially fix the path\nobeying equations of motion which should almost certainly be the realized one. In\nthis way we can claim that to a good approximation an imaginary part of the action\nwill choose/settle the initial conditions.\nIn the present article it is not the point to settle on any choice of the in usual\nsense \"theory of everything\". Rather we shall present our idea of introducing an\nimaginary part in the Lagrangian and thereby also in the action as a modification\nthat can be made on any theory as represented by the real action S.\nWe have already published a few articles on essentially a classical formulation\nof the present model. We sought in these articles to be a little more general by\nsimply defining a probability weight called P (path) defined for all possible paths. In\nclassical theory it is really only the paths which obey the classical equations of motion\nfor which we need to define P . We already in the earlier articles suggested that this\nprobability P (path) for a certain track, path, to be the one realized in nature should\nbe given as the exponential of an expression depending on the track, path, of the form\nof a space-time integral over a locally defined quantity LI depending on the fields in\nthe development, path. Really this quantity LI (really \u2212LI ) comes into determining\n2\n\n\fthe probability as if it were the imaginary part of the Lagrangian density.\nA major point of the present article is to set up the quantum formulation of our\nalready published model, now really settling on taking the suggestive idea of just\nmaking the action complex, but with a priori a different set of coupling constants\nand m2 for real and imaginary part separately.\nA genuine problem with our kind of model is that very likely it predicts that\nspecial simple configurations leading to big probability may be arranged at a priori\nany time. That is to say, with our type of model it needs an explanation that one\nin particle almost never see any great arrangements being organized to occur later\non. Really such arrangements might seem to us to be something like a hand of\nGod, but they seem very seldom. Thus at first it looks that our type of model is\nalready falsified by the non-appearance of arrangements. Really such a problem is\nalmost obviously expected to occur in a model that like ours does not a priori make\nany time reversal asymmetric assumption at the fundamental level. Unless in the\nHartle-Hawking no boundary postulate [10] we add some timereversal asymmetry\nspontaneously other otherwise that theory will be up to similar problems [11, 12].\nA model-language describing how final states can be imposed by a density matrix\n\u03c1f is put forward by Hartle and Gell-Mann [14].\nIn the present work we hope for that a certain moment in the 'middle of times'\nwill turn out to become dominant w.r.t. fixing the special solution selected as the\nrealized one, and that this time can then be interpreted as a close to Big Bang time\n( there may not really be a true big bang but just an inflation era coming out of a\ndeflation era continuously). Then since we live in the time after this decisive Big\nBang simulating era there is for us a time reversal asymmetry, nevertheless it is a\nproblem that like ours is even timetranslational invariant w.r.t. the law that finally\nsettle the 'initial conditions' to explain that there are not more prearranged events\nthan one seemingly see.\nHowever, we believe to have found some explanations able to suppress so many\nof these prearrangements that our model can be made compatible with present\nexperience of essentially no prearrangements.\nFor really avoiding it we shall assume consistency of Dirac strings, but let us\npostpone that discussion to section 13 below.\nOur model is really inspired from the considerations of time machines[13] and the\n\n3\n\n\ftroubles of needs for prearrangements in order to avoid the so called grand mother\nparadoxes, meaning the inconsistencies occurring when one seeks to go back in time\nand changes the events there.\nWe shall present the work by making two attempts to assumption about how\nto interpret the Feynmann path integrals with the imaginary part of the action\nnon-zero. In the first part of the paper we start out from letting the average of\na dynamical variable O be given by equation (2.9) below, but that this is a priori\nnot so good is seen by it not being (safely) real even if the dynamical variable O is\nreal. Therefore in section 7 we restart the discussion so now from the side of the\ninterpretation of the Feynmann path way integrals in our model.\nFirst trial of interpretation\nIn the next section 2, we shall put forward the basic formula for expectation\nvalues with our complex action model and the philosophy that this model even\ndeliver the initial condition, or better the solution of equation of motion to be the\none realized.\nIn section 3 we review our earlier reasons for that future should have only little\ninfluence on what happens.\nIn section 4 we then shall argue for some approximate treatment of the functional\nintegral in the late times t, the future.\nIn section 5 we shall make use of the approximation of the future to obtain the\nusual quantum mechanics expressions at least in the case where our imaginary part\nSI of the action can be ignored. (It should be stressed that we actually have used\nalready a philosophy based on this SI being non zero, so it is not fully zero.)\nIn section 6 it turns out that we \u2013 perhaps not completely convincing though \u2013\ncan make the effect be that we return to probability in practical scattering experiments say get conserved.\nSecond trial of interpretation:\nIn section 7 we restart the discussion of making the interpretation formula for\nthe Feynmann path way integral, which after some talk takes the way of using\nthe classical approximation weighted with the exponential of minus 2 times the\nimaginary part of the action. In a subsection 7.5 we formally connect our model to\nour earlier one based on the probability weight P (path).\nIn section 8 we develop a rather general formula for the correlated probability\n\n4\n\n\ffor a series of dynamical quantities or operators Oi at different moments of time\ntake values inside small ranges specified.\nIn section 9 we go a bit further in making the expressions like the ones one uses in\npractice in usual theories. Most importantly we again consider how to approximate\nthe future when the effects of the imaginary part of the action is very small.\nIn section 10 we put the simplest example of the more general formula, namely a\nformula for the probability of just one operator at one time being in a given range.\n( This question would be impossible to predict even in principle in other theories,\nbut we in principle can, but in practice not usually). But the resulting formula\nhas what we call \"squared form\" in the sense that the projector comes in twice as\na factor in it. The finding of a reduction to an unsquared form is left to section\n12, while we in section 11 then give an example of application of very interesting\nphysical significance. In fact section 11 predicts a broadening of the width of the\nHiggs particle due to the imaginary action.\nIn section 12 we then bring about a connection between the postulated interpretation formulas for probabilities put forward in part I and part II. In fact we find\nthat they coincide under rather suggestive assumptions.\nIn section 13 we bring the promised argument for removing the effects of the\nimaginary action SI from the domain of older accelerators, since otherwise our model\nwould have been falsified. The argument is based on assuming monopoles.\nIn section 14 we conclude and give a bit of outlook.\n\nPart I, First Trial of Interpretation\n2\n\nPhilosophy and formula\n\nOur basic modification of introducing an imaginary part in the actions leads to that\nR\nR i\ni\nintegrand eiS or e ~ S of the Feynmann path way integrand eiS D\u03c6 or e ~ S D\u03c6 (if\n\nthe Planck constant is written explicitly) varies a lot in magnitude, and not only in\nphase as usual. This effect is likely to make some regions in the space of paths \u2013 or\nwe could restrict to the space paths with \u03b4S = 0, i.e. the space classical solutions\n\n\u2013 get a very much bigger weight in the integral than others. Actually it can likely\nhappen that only a very narrow range of paths or better solutions (= paths obeying\n\n5\n\n\f\u03b4S = 0) will quite dominate the integral\nZ\neiS D\u03c6.\n\n(2.1)\n\nThat should naturally be taken to mean that the presumed narrow range of\ndominating paths represent the paths being actually realized in nature. It is in this\nway that we hope our model to essentially predict the initial state for the realized\nsolutions. It is important to have in mind that such an effect of the imaginary action\nSI of selecting narrow bunches of solutions can make the boundary conditions at an\ninitial and a final time for a period to be studied say, superfluous. A bit optimistically\nwe might imagine that the imaginary part of action makes the functional integral\nconverge even without boundary condition specifications. Note that being allowed\nto throw boundary conditions away \u2013 having them replaced by effects of SI \u2013 is a\ngreat/nice simplification. We consider this achievement as an aesthetically very nice\nfeature of our model! Supposing that this works to deliver a meaningful Feynmannpath integral (2.1) even without boundary conditions this way we must now decide\nhow one is supposed to extract information now in principle for the true expectation\nvalue as it should occur even without further input. Note here that we are \u2013 but\nonly in principle \u2013 proposing an exceedingly ambitious model compared to usual\nquantum field theories:\nWe want to predict expectation values without any further input than the mere\ncomplex action! This of course corresponds to that our level of ambition is to\nin addition to the usual time-development laws of nature also predict the initial\nconditions, i.e. what really happens!\nTo write down the formula for some physical quantity let us first exercise by a\nquantity O(\u03c6|t ) which is a function of the fields \u03c6|t restricted to some time t, where\n\u03c6 is a general symbol for all the fields in the model.\nIf we for instance use the Standard Model as the starting model, then providing\nit with an imaginary part of the Lagrangian density, then the symbol \u03c6(x) (x \u2208 R\u03004 )\nis really a set\n\u03c6 = (Aa\u03bc , \u03c8 b , H)\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere the indices on the Fermion fields runs through the combination of flavor and\ncolor and/or W -spin components, while the index on the gauge fields run through\n6\n\n\fthe 12 gauge fields \u2013 8 gluon color combination plus (B\u03bc ) the U(1)-component and\n3 W 's \u2013. Finally H is the two complex component Higgs field.\nThe quantity O(\u03c6|t ) can of course be considered a functional of the whole field\ndevelopment O(\u03c6) also, i.e. it could be consider a functional of the path of one\nwants.\nThe simplest proposal for what the average quantity O(\u03c6) would be\nR iS[\u03c6]\ne\nO(\u03c6)D\u03c6\n.\nhO(\u03c6)i = R iS[\u03c6]\ne\nD\u03c6\n\nThis would mean that we have a \"sort of probability\" given by\nR\n\u03b4(O(\u03c6) \u2212 O0 )eiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\nR\n\"Probability of O being O0 \" =\neiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\n\n(2.3)\n\n(2.4)\n\nNow, however, we must admit that conceiving of this expression as a probability is\nupset by the severe problem that it will typically be a complex number. There is\nno guarantee that it is positive or zero.\nThus a priori one would say that this simple expression for the probability density\nis quite untenable.\nNevertheless it is our intention to claim that we should \u2013 and that is then part\nof our model \u2013 use the simple expression (2.4) and the corresponding (2.3) and the\nexpression to be given below for more general operators O corresponding also to\n(2.3) and (2.4).\nFirst let us again stress that it is our a priori philosophy that somehow the imaginary part SI managed to fix both a state in future and in past. Thereby asking\nthe average of some quantity O becomes much like in an already finished double\nslit experiment (Bohr-Einstein) in which a particle already have been measured on\nthe photographic plate (presumable on an interference line) what were the average\nposition of the particle when it past the double slit screen. Really asking such a\nquestion concerning a quantity O that were not measured and could not have been\nmeasured without having disturbed the outcome of something later is one of the\nforbidden questions in quantum mechanics. Indeed it is by asking this sort of questions which are not answerable by measurement that Einstein can find ammunition\nagainst quantum mechanics. In other words our proposal (2.4) for \"probability distribution\" is a priori \u2013 with our present philosophy of a future essentially determined\nby SI \u2013 an answer to a quantum mechanically forbidden question. Niels Bohr would\nsay we should not ask it.\n7\n\n\fIn that light it may of course not be so serious that our formula gives a rather\nstupid or crazy answer, a complex probability!\nBut now we have the problem of justifying that if we made a true measurement\nthe answer would turn out to give positive (or zero) probability.\nLet us take as the important feature of a measurement of some quantity O that\nthere is an apparatus which makes a lot of degrees of freedom, \u03be say (really macroscopic systems) develop in a way depending on value of O. Such an amplification\nof the effect of the actual value of O is characteristic for a measurement. Unless\nsomehow there are special reasons for that SI be insensitive to \u03be (as we shall actually\nlater seek to show but do not assume to be the case) we expect that SI typically will\ndepend on the macroscopically many d.o.f. \u03be being influenced by O-value measured.\nNow we argue like this: Since there is a huge (macroscopical) number of variables\n\u03be depending on the value of O \"measured\", the imaginary part SI of the action is\nlikely to depend very strongly on this measured value \u2013 very rapidly varying.\nWe here think of SI as the integral over the imaginary part of the Lagrangian\nLI over all times t \u2208] \u2212 \u221e, \u221e[\n\u0012\nZ\nSI =\n\n\u221e\n\nLI dt\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.5)\n\nBecause of the great complications in an actual measuring apparatus, let alone\nthe further developments depending the measured value, publications and so on,\nthe imaginary action SI can easily be a very complicated function of the measured\nO value. Even if SI as function of the measured O value should in principle be\ncontinuous it may in practice vary so much up and down \u2013 caused by accidents\ninfluenced by the broadcasted measuring value \u2013 that very likely the smallest value\nof SI occurs for a seemingly accidental value of the measured O. If the SI -variation\nwith the \"measured O\" is indeed very strong so that the SI variations are big the\nexponential weight e\u2212SI contained in (2.3) and (2.4) will have a completely dominant\nvalue for only one measured O-value.\nIn this way our model has the integral in the numerator of (2.4) be much bigger\nfor one single value of O0 . If so, then the ratio (2.4) is actually \u221d 1 for this O0 -value\nand negligible for all other O0 -values. This means that our model much like usual\nmeasurement theory (in Copenhagen interpretation) predicts that crudely only one\nvalue of a measured quantity is realized. In principle it is even so that, bearing\n8\n\n\fa very special situation, the result of the measurement is calculable by essentially\nminimizing the imaginary action SI . In practice, however, such calculation will only\nbe doable in extremely rare cases. (If we impress a special result by threatening\nwith a Higgs-producing machine).\nWe postpone the argumentation for that the probability distribution to be obtained in practice shall be the one of usual quantum mechanical measurement theory\npartly to the later sections and partly to a subsequent paper.\nAt the end of this section let us extend slightly our formula (2.3) and thereby also\n(2.4), to the case where the quantity O corresponds in usual quantum mechanics to\nan operator that do not commute with the fields \u03c6.\nAn operator corresponding to a quantity measurable at a moment of time t will in\ngeneral in the quantum field theory considered be given by a matrix with a columns\nand rows in correspondence with field functions \u03c6|t restricted to the time t. I.e. O\nis given by a \"matrix\"\n\u0001\n\u03c6\u2032 |t O \u03c6|t = O(\u03c6\u2032 |t , \u03c6|t ) .\n|\n{z\n}\n\n(2.6)\n\nWhat should be the formulas replacing (2.3) and (2.4) in this more general case?\nWell, our main starting point were that we assumed our imaginary part SI to\n(essentially) fix both a further |Bi and a past state |Ai. A natural notation to\nintroduce is in fact \u2013 for the past \u2013\nh\u03c6|t |Ai = A[\u03c6|t ] =\n\nZ\n\neiS\u2212\u221e to t D\u03c6\n\n(2.7)\n\nending at \u03c6|t\n\nand analogously\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nhB|\u03c6|t i = h\u03c6|t |Bi = B[\u03c6|t ] =\n\nZ\n\neiSt to +\u221e D\u03c6\n\n(2.8)\n\nbeginning at \u03c6|t\n\nIn this notation our previous formulas (2.3) and (2.4) are for the in \u03c6|t diagonal\noperators O(\u03c6|t ) become\nR\n\neiS O(\u03c6|t )D\u03c6\nR\neiS D\u03c6\nH\nhB|\u03c6|t iO(\u03c6|t )h\u03c6|t |Ai\n\u03c6|t\nH\n=\nhB|\u03c6|t ih\u03c6|t|Ai\n\u03c6|t\n\nhOi =\n\n=\n\nhB|O|Ai\nhB|Ai\n\n9\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fand (2.4) becomes\n\"Probability of O being O0 \" =\n\nhB|\u03b4(O \u2212 O0 )|Ai\nhB|Ai\n\n(2.10)\n\nNow really we want to suggest that formula (2.9) and (2.10) can also be used for\noperators that are not simply functions of the fields \u03c6|t at time t, used in the\nfunctional integral.\nIn order to justify that extension of our interpretation formulas we want to\nremark:\n1. Provided a Hermitean operator O has either |Ai or |Bi as eigenstate then the\neigenvalue O\u2032 in question can of course be extracted as\nO\u2032 =\n\nhB|O|Ai\nhB|Ai\n\n(2.11)\n\n2.

Indeed we shall rewrite (2.19) into (2.20) below.\n\n2.1\n\nJustification of philosophy from semiclassical approximation\n\nIn semiclassical approximation one simply evaluates different contributions to the\nfunctional integral (1) by seeking the different extrema for eiS or equivalent S = SR +\n11\n\n\fiSI . Around such an extemum it is extremely well known that one can approximate\nS by the Taylor expansion up to second order\nZ\n1\n\u22022S\nS = S(extremum) +\n2\n\u2202\u03c6 (x )\u2202\u03c62 (x2 )\n\u0001 1 1\n\u0001\nextr\n* \u03c61 (x1 ) \u2212 \u03c61 (x1 ) \u03c62 (x2 ) \u2212 \u03c6extr\n2 (x2 ) + * * *\n\nd4 x1 d4 x2\n\nwhere then the linear terms\nZ\n\u0001 4\n\u2202S\n\u03c61 (x1 ) \u2212 \u03c6extr\n1 (x1 ) d (x1 )\n\u2202\u03c61 (x1 )\n\n(2.21)\n\n(2.22)\n\nextr\nvanish because of the extremiticity condition. Here \u03c6extr\n1 (x1 ) and \u03c62 (x2 ) denote\n\nthe fields at the extremum field configuration development. Such an extremum as\nis well known corresponds to a solution to\n\u03b4S = 0\n\n(2.23)\n\ni.e. solving the variational principle leading to classical equations of motion.\nThe main term in the exponent iS(extremum) is in the usual real action case\npurely imaginary and thus only gives rise to a phase factor so that in this approximation the contribution has the same size for all the classical solutions, provided\nthey can go on for real field configurations. With our SI included, however, we tend\nto get even to the approximation of the first term in the Taylor expansion (2.21) a\nreal term \u2212SI into the exponent and thus the order of magnitude for one classical\nsolution compared to another can easily become tremendous\n|eiS(extremum) | = e\u2212SI (extremum) .\n\n(2.24)\n\nIt is our philosophy that only relatively very few classical solution have e\u2212SI (extremum) 's\ndominating violently the rest. In this sense we expect and assumed that such one or\na very few classical solutions could be considered the only one realized. With very\nbig size of SI \u2013 and that can easily come about for a couple of reasons \u2013 it gets relatively only exceedingly few classical solutions that are competitive in the sense that\nfor most classical solutions (of (2.23)) you have exceedingly small e\u2212SI compared to\nthe few dominant ones. As the reasons for SI being big when it is not forbidden by\ngauge invariance and the condition that Dirac strings shall be unobservable we can\ngive:\n12\n\n\f1. There is in analogy to the SR -term a ~1 -factor in front of SI . For practical\npurposes we know that we shall consider the Planck constant ~ to be very\nsmall.\n2. We could easily get Avogadros number come in as a factor in the SI because\nit would get such a factor a priori since there are typically in the world of\nmacroscopic bodies of that order magnitude molecules.\n\n3\n\nApproximate treatment of future part of functional integral (treatment of |Bti)\n\nIn our earlier works[8] \u2013 in which we mainly worked in the classical approximation\n\u2013 we presented some arguments that in the era which have been going on since\nshort time of after some effective (or real) Big Bang the imaginary Lagrangian or\naction LI or SI effectively became very trivial. That should mean that under the\ntimes starting after some early Big Bang and extending into the future we could\napproximately take LI and the part of SI coming from this era as independent of\nwhat are the practical possibilities for what can go on. Thus we should in this\npresent era supposed to extend into even the infinite future be allowed to ignore in\nfirst approximation the imaginary parts LI or SI .\nThe reasons, which we presented for that were that this present era including\nsupposedly all future is dominated by two types of particles:\n1. Massless particles (really the entropy of the universe is today dominated by\nthe massless microwave back ground radiation of photons).\n2. Non-relativistic particles carrying practically conserved quantum numbers (the\nnucleons and the electrons are characterized by their charges and baryon or\nlepton number so as to make their decays into lighter particles impossible).\nThe argument then went that we could write the action \u2013 actually both real SR\nand imaginary SI \u2013 for these particles, treated as particles, as a sum having each\ngiving a contribution proportional to the eigentimes for them:\nSR , SI =\n\nX\n\nparticles P\n\n13\n\nKP { R } * \u03c4P .\nI\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fThat is to say that each of the particles contribute to SI say a contribution\nproportional to the eigentime\nSI from P \u221d \u03c4P .\n\n(3.2)\n\nNow for massless particles any step in eigentime\n\u2206\u03c4P = 0 (for massless)\n\n(3.3)\n\nand for nonrelativistic (\u2243 slow) particles, such a step is\n\u2206\u03c4P = \u2206t\n\n(3.4)\n\nequal to the usual time. Since the number of the conserved quantum numbers\nprotected particles are all the time the same the whole contribution to the SI from\nthe present era becomes very trivial:\nZero from the massless, and just a constant integrated over coordinate time for\nthe conserved particles.\nIn addition there are terms from interactions contributing a priori to say SI also.\nSince, however, in the era since a little after Big Bang the density of particles were\nlow in fundamental units presumably also the interaction contributions would be\nmuch suppressed in this after Big Bang era.\nSo all together we estimate that it is only the very early Big Bang times that will\ndominate SI . Thus the solution to the equations of motion being in a model with\nan imaginary action SI selected to be the realized one will mainly depend on what\nhappened in that solution in the early Big Bang era. This means that it will be in\nour era as if it were the initial state that were a rather special one determined by\nhaving an especially small contribution to SI from Big Bang times. This would mean\na rather well determined starting state roughly which interpreted as a macrostate\nwould be one with low entropy. That is at least a good beginning for obtaining the\nsecond law of thermodynamics, since then there are supposedly no strong effects of\nSI any more to enforce the universe to go to any special macrostate. Rather it will\ngo into bigger and bigger macrostates meaning that they have higher and higher\nentropy.\nAlthough we have now argued for approximately seeing no effects of SI in the\nera after Big Bang implying that our model should have no effects in this era, this\nis however, presumably not being quite sufficiently accurate.\n14\n\n\fWe shall, however, below in section 9 invent or find arguments that will allow\nus to get completely rid of the LI or SI from the in the Standard Model already\nfound particles. Only for the Higgs involving processes our arguments in section 9\nbased on gauge symmetry and the assumption of unobservability of Dirac strings\nassociated with monopoles will not quite function. Thus we still expect that an\nSI -contribution pops up with Higgs-particles. But since Higgs-particles are so far\nnot well studied such an effect of SI might well have been overlooked so far.\n\n4\n\nTreatment of |Bti or Treatment of the future\nfactor in the functional integral\n\nIn equation (2.8) above we defined what one could call \"the future part\" of the\nfunctional integral relative to the time t. It should however be kept in mind that it\nis a part in the sense that the full integral is a contraction (a sort of product) of the\npast part and this future part,\nZ\n\neiS D\u03c6 = hBt |At i.\n\n(4.1)\n\nNow we must remember that according to the second law of thermodynamics the\nstate of the universe if at all obtainable (calculable) should be so by considering the\ndevelopment in the past having lead to it. The future, however, should be rather\nshaped after what happened earlier. This suggests that we should mainly have the\npossibility to guess or know |At i but determined from the fundamental Lagrangian\nas our model suggests. Really in order not to disagree drastically with the second law\nof thermodynamics the future should be shaped from the past and reflect the latter.\nHowever, there should not be \u2013 at least not much \u2013 adjustment of the happenings\nat say time t in order to arrange something special simple happening in future.\nThis means in or formalism that the by the SI future contributions determined\n|Bt i should according to second law better disappear quite from our formula for\npredicting probabilities for operator values, i.e. from (2.4) or more generally (2.19).\nNow, however, as we argued in foregoing section \u2013 section 3 \u2013 reviewing previous\narticles working in the classical approximation it should be the state of a solution\nto the equations of motion in the early Big Bang time that dominates the selection\nof such a solution to be the realized one. The future on the other hand has only a\n15\n\n\fsmall effect, if any, on choosing the true or realized solution. With the arguments\nto be given in section 9 we argue for the effects of SI being even smaller in the\nfuture. Nevertheless we have if we talk exactly also effects of SI even in the future.\nOtherwise the hypothesis that the integral (2.8) defining |Bt i would be senseless\nsince the e\u2212SI -weighting is needed to suppress the integrand e\u2212SI enough to make\nhope of a sensible practical convergence.\nHowever, we have in section 3 and will in section 9 argue for that SI varies much\nless in the future than in Big Bang era.\nIt is now the purpose of the present section to use this only weak SI variation with\nthe fields in the future to argue for an approximation in density matrix terminology\nfor the future part |Bt i of the functional integral.\nLet us indeed perform the following considerations for estimating the crude treatment of |Bt i which we shall use:\na) Since SI has in practice only small non-trivial contributions in the future it is\nneeded to involve contributions in the integral\nZ \u221e Z\nSIt\u2032 to +\u221e =\ndt d~x LI\n\n(4.2)\n\nt\u2032\n\nfrom very large t \u2265 t\u2032 .\nb) At these enormous t regions then at the end we get finally a rather restricted\nrange of solutions. \u2013 we can think of classical solutions here, if we like \u2013\nc) Now the solutions from the enormously late times under a) have to be developed backward in time to the time t\u2032 say to deliver the state |Bt\u2032 i (really we\nfirst get hBt\u2032 |\u03c6i from equation (2.8)).\nd) Now we make the assumption that the system/world is sufficiently \"ergodic\"\nand the large times so large and so smeared out (also because of the smallness\nof the LI -effects) that we can take it that there is almost the same probability\nfor finding the system in state |Bt\u2032 i at any place in phase space allowed by the\nconserved quantum numbers of the theory practically valid in the future era.\ne) Ignoring for simplicity the conserved quantities we thus argued that with equal\nprobability; equally distributed in phase space, we have that |Bt\u2032 i will be any\nstate.\n16\n\n\ff) We can especially imagine that we have chosen a basis of wave packet states\n|wi in the field configuration space so that they fill smoothly the phase space\n\u2013 accessible without violating the conservation laws relevant \u2013. Taking these\nto be \u2013 approximately \u2013 orthonormal hw|w \u2032i \u2248 \u03b4ww \u2032 we clearly get for the\naverage expectation of the projection operator\nPBt\u2032 = |Bt\u2032 ihBt\u2032 |\n\n(4.3)\n\nthe estimate\nav(|Bt\u2032 ihBt\u2032 |) =\n\n1 X\n1\n|wihw| \u2243 1\nN w\nN\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere N is the number of states in the basis\n|wi, w = 1, 2, * * * , N.\n\n(4.5)\n\nThat is to say we have argued for that our weak SI -influence in future combined\nwith an assumed approximate ergodicity leads to that we can approximate\n|Bt\u2032 ihBt\u2032 | \u2248\n\n1\n1\nN\n\n(4.6)\n\nin practice for all t\u2032 at least a bit later than the earliest Big Bang.\nThe crude estimate that we could replace |Bt ihBt | by\n(|Bt ihBt | \u2248\n\n5\n\n1\n1)\nN\n\n1\n1\nN\n\nderived as formula\n\nwere based on that LI were in practice small.\n\nDeriving a more usual probability formula\n\nWe shall now make use of approximation (4.6) for the \"future factor\" in the functional integral in order to obtain an expression rewriting the formulas like (2.3),\n(2.4) and (2.18) and (2.19) into expressions analogous to (2.20).\nThe calculation is in fact rather trivial, starting say from the most general of our\n\n17\n\n\fpostulated expressions (2.18):\nhO(\u03c6|t , \u03a0|t )i\n\nR\n\neiS O(\u03c6|t , \u03a0|t )D\u03c6\nR\neiS D\u03c6\nhBt |O(\u03c6|t , \u03a0|t )|At i\n=\nhBt |At i\ntrivial step hAt |Bt ihBt |O(\u03c6|t , \u03a0|t )|At i\n=\nhAt |Bt ihBt |At i\n1\nusing (4.6) hAt | N 1O(\u03c6|t , \u03a0|t )|At i\n=\nhAt | N1 1|At i\nhAt |O(\u03c6|t , \u03a0|t )|At i\n=\nhAt |At i\n=\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhich is the completely usual quantum mechanical expression for the expectation\nvalue of the operator O(\u03c6|t , \u03a0|t ) in the wave functional state |At i.\nWith this expression we see that we should be allowed, as we anyway would\nexpect, to use |At i as the quantum state of the universe.\nIt should be noted though that our |At i is in principle calculable from the \"theory\" when as we shall of course, count also the SI -expression as part of the theory.\nIn this way our model is widely more ambitious than usual quantum mechanics:\nWe have \u2013 much like the Hartle-Hawking no boundary proposal \u2013 a functional\nintegral (2.7) delivering in principle the wave functional |At i. In usual quantum\nmechanics the wave function is left for the experimental physicist to find out from\nhis somewhat difficult job of preparing the state. In practice we would presumably\nhave to let him be so helped by observation and arrangements under the preparation\nthat we almost leave to him the usual job. We should, however, have in mind that in\npreparing a state one will usually need to trust that some material is a rather pure\nchemical substance or that no disturbing cosmic radiation spoils the preparation.\nThese kinds of trusts are usually based on some empirical experience which in turn\nmakes use of that big assembles of pure substances are easily/likely available and\nthat generally cosmic ray has low intensity. Such trusts however, are at the very\nroot connected with the starting state \u2013 the cosmology \u2013 of our world. But this\nstarting state for practical purposes is in our model based on the activity of our LI\nin early Big Bang times of the initial state of the universe.\nThus it is even in the practical way of preparing a quantum state a lot of reference\nto our SI .\n18\n\n\fIf, however, somehow the universe develops into states where LI is no longer\nnegligible we should expect corrections to such an approximation (|Bt ihBt | \u2248\n\n6\n\n1\n1).\nN\n\nTime development and SI corrections to |Bti\n\nFrom the definitions (2.7) and (2.8) of |At i and |Bt i it is trivial to derive the time\ndevelopment formulas for these Hilbert space vectors (say for t\u2032 > t)\nZ\neiS\u2212\u221e to t\u2032 D\u03c6\n|At\u2032 i =\n\u2032\nZover time\u2212\u221e to t\n=\neiSt to t\u2032 At [\u03c6|t ]D\u03c6\nover t to t\u2032\n\u2032\n\n= U (t , t)|At i\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere U (t\u2032 , t) is the operator corresponding to the matrix (with columns and rows\nmarked by \u03c6|t configurations)\nZ\n\u2032\nU (\u03c6\u0302|t\u2032 , \u03c6\u0302|t ) =\n\neiSt to t\u2032 D\u03c6.\n\n(6.2)\n\nover t to t\u2032 with \u03c6|t\u2032 =\u03c6\u0302|t\u2032 and \u03c6|t =\u03c6\u0302|t\n\nSimilarly we have from (2.8) for t\u2032 > t again, first taking the complex conjugate of\n(2.8)\nh\u03c6|t |Bt i =\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\ne\u2212iSt to +\u221e D\u03c6\n\n(6.3)\n\nbeginning at \u03c6|t\n\nand thus\nh\u03c6|t |Bt i =\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\ne\u2212iSt to +\u221e h\u03c6|t\u2032 |Bt\u2032 iD\u03c6\n\n(6.4)\n\nover t to t\u2032\n\nwhich can be written\n|Bt i = Uwith LI \u2192\u2212LI (t\u2032 , t)+ |Bt\u2032 i.\n\n(6.5)\n\nHere we used that e.g.\nSt to +\u221e =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\n\nt\n\nZ\n\n~ R + iLI )\nd3 X(L\n\n(6.6)\n\nwhere LR and LI are respectively the real and the imaginary parts of the Lagrangian\ndensities. So\nSt\u2217to +\u221e\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\n\nZ\n19\n\nd3~x(LR \u2212 iLI ),\n\n(6.7)\n\n\fand now restricting ourselves for {pedagogics/simplicity} at first to boson fields we\nhave (usually) that for them LR and LI are even order in the time derivatives which\nare under latticification\n\u2202t \u03c6(t, ~x) \u2248\n\n\u03c6(t + \u2206t, ~x) \u2212 \u03c6(t, ~x)\n.\n\u2206t\n\n(6.8)\n\nThus conceived as operators between the configuration at the two close by times t\nand t + \u2206t, i.e. with columns and rows marked by \u03c6|t+\u2206t and \u03c6|t we have e.g.\n(LR + iLI )+ = LR \u2212 iLI\n\n(6.9)\n\nLTR = LR and LTI = LI\n\n(6.10)\n\nL\u2217R = LR and L\u2217I = LI .\n\n(6.11)\n\nbecause\n\nand\n\nIn formula (6.5) of course the meaning of the under symbol text in the expression Uwith LI \u2192\u2212LI (t\u2032 , t)+ is that in addition to taking the Hermitian conjugation of\nU (t\u2032 , t) as defined by the matrix representation (6.2) one shall shift the sign for all\noccurrences of the LI -part of the Lagrangian or of the LI -part of the Lagrangian\ndensity. One should have in mind that it is easily seen that\nU (t\u2032 , t)\u22121 = Uwith LI \u2192\u2212LI (t\u2032 , t)+ .\n\n(6.12)\n\nEspecially the \"usual\" case of LI = 0 means that U (t\u2032 , t) becomes unitary. This\nrelation (6.12) together with (6.5) and (6.1) ensures that\nZ\nhBt |At i = eiS\u2212\u221e to +\u221e D\u03c6\n\n(6.13)\n\ncan be true independent of the time t chosen on the left hand side.\nSince (6.1) represents a completely usual time development of the 'wave function'\n|At i we have of course analogously to the usual theory\ni\n\nd|At i\n= H|At i\ndt\n\n(6.14)\n\nS = SR + SI\n\n(6.15)\n\nwhere then H is the to the action\n\n20\n\n\fcorresponding Hamiltonian. As we saw under point a) in section 2 formula (2.20)\nwe can consider\n|At i\n\n(6.16)\n\nthe wave function for the universe essentially. But really because of the normalizing\ndenominator in (2.20) it is rather the normalized |At i, namely\np\n|At inorm = |At i/ hAt |At i\n\n(6.17)\n\nwhich is the true wave function.\n\nIt is important to remeark that precisely because we now find that we shall\nuse the normalized wave function rather than |At i itself we do not get as could\nbe feared a lack of conservation of probability due to the non-unitarity of the time\ndevelopment. Have in mind that the to a non-real action corresponding Hamiltonian\nH will not be Hermitean! But with the normalizaion comming from the hAt |At i in\nthe denominator in (2.20) the total probability will anyway remain unity.This result\nmatches nicely with the from the slightly different start evaluated (9.22) below.\n\nPart II, Second Trial of Interpretation\n7\n\nSecond Interpretation of the functional integral\n\nUsually one only uses the functional integral over a time interval to evaluate a\ntransition matrix element from an initial time ti to a final time tf\nZ\nZ\nfixed time\nU (\u03c8f (\u03c6|f ), \u03c8i (\u03c6|i )) = D\n\u03c6|f D fixed time \u03c6|i D\u03c6 eiSti to tf [\u03c6]\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere\nSti to tf =\n\nZ\n\ntf\n\nti\n\nZ\n\nL(x)d3~xdt\n\n(7.2)\n\nand the functional integral over D\u03c6 is restricted to \u03c6-functions (field developments,\nor paths) which at times ti and tf respectively coincides with \u03c6|i and \u03c6|f respectively.\nIn the present article we, however, have the ambition of having the functional\nintegral determine a priori not only the development with time but also say something about the initial conditions so that we a priori might ask for the probability\n21\n\n\fof some dynamical variable O say having certain value O at a certain time without\nimposing any initial conditions. In order to obtain a formula or proceedure or how\nto obtain such probabilities for what shall happen we have to assume such a formula.\nWe therefore need some intuitive and phenomenological guess leading to such a\nformula/prescription.\nIn order to propose such a formula in a sensible way we shall first consider a\nsemiclassical approximation for our functional integral supposed to be connected\nwith and describing the development of the Universe\nZ\nD\u03c6 eiS[\u03c6]\n\n(7.3)\n\nwhere we remember that in our model the S[\u03c6] is not as usual real but is allowed to\nbe complex.\n\n7.1\n\nSemiclassical approach\n\nFor first orientation let us imagine that the imaginary part of the action S[\u03c6] is\neffectively small in the sense that we can obtain the most significant contributions\nto the functional integral by asking for saddle points for the real part SR . That is\nwe ask for field development solutions to the variational principle\n\u03b4SR = 0.\n\n(7.4)\n\nWithout specifying the boundary conditions at t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e in our functional integral\nthere should be (essentially) one solution for any point in the (classical) phase space\nof the field theory described. For the enumeration of the various development solutions \u03c6 we could use the field and conjugate field configuration at any chosen moment\nof time, to say. However, now our hope and speculation is that the imaginary part\nshould give a probability weight distribution over the set (\u2243 phase space) of these\nclassical solutions.\n\n7.2\n\nA first but wrong thinking\n\nIt is clear that we must make a definition of an expectation value for function(al) O\nsay of the field development \u03c6 so that if a single (semi) classical solution \u03c6sol comes\nto be highly weighted then this expectation value should be O[\u03c6sol ].\n22\n\n\fWe might therefore at first think of\nR\nD\u03c6O[\u03c6] eiS[\u03c6]\nhOi = R\n.\nD\u03c6 eiS[\u03c6]\n\n(7.5)\n\nIf really a single classical path contributed completely dominantly to both nu-\n\nmerator and denominator, then indeed we would obtain that this proposal would\nobey\nhOi = O[\u03c6sol dom ]\n\n(7.6)\n\nwhere \u03c6sol dom is this single dominant solution.\nIt is however likely that if will be more realistic to imagine that there is a huge\nnumber of significant classical solutions \u03c6sol . But then appears the \"problem\" that\nin the expansion of the numerator functional integral into contributions from the\nvarious (semi) classical solutions \u03c6sol i :\nZ\nX\nD\u03c6O[\u03c6]eiS[\u03c6] =\n\neiS[\u03c6sol i ] O[\u03c6sol i ]\n\n\u03c6sol i all the classical solutions\n\np\n\ndeti\n\n\u22121\n\n(7.7)\n\nthe various contributions contribute with quite different signs or rather phases due\nto the appearance of the phase factor eiSR [\u03c6sol i ] . The proposal just put forward thus\nis not as it stands a usual average, it lacks the usual requirement of an average of\nbeing performed with a positive weight. Rather the summation over the contribution\nbecomes a summation with random phases to a good approximation. That means\nthat if we classify in some ways the different solutions \u03c6sol i into classes, then what\nwould sum up when such classes are combined would be the squared contributions\nrather than the contributions themselves. In other words, if we define a contribution\nto\nZ\n\nD\u03c6 eiS[\u03c6] O[\u03c6] =\n\nXp\n\n\u22121\n\ndeti eiS[\u03c6sol i ] O[\u03c6sol i ]\n\n(7.8)\n\n\u03c6sol i\n\nwhere\n\u0013\n\u03b42\n(7.9)\ndeti = det\n\u03b4\u03c61 (x1 )\u03b4\u03c62 (x2 )\nfrom a certain class of semi classical solution Ck then the quantities such as\nZ\nX p\n\u22121\nO eiS D\u03c6\n\u2261\n(7.10)\ndeti eiS[\u03c6sol i ] O[\u03c6sol i ]\n\u0012\n\nfrom class Ck\n\n\u03c6sol i\u2208Ck\n\n23\n\n\fobey approximately\nZ\n\u2248\n\n2\niS\n\nO e D\u03c6\nZ\n\nfrom class C1\n\n+\n\n2\n\nZ\n\niS\n\nO e D\u03c6\n\nfrom class C2\n\n2\n\nO eiS D\u03c6\n\nfrom class C1 \u222aC2\n\n.\n\n(7.11)\n\nHowever we do not have a similar addition formula for numerical values as\n2\nZ\nO eiS D\u03c6\n,\nfrom class C1\n\nwhen they are not squared.

Thus we would ignore the determinant\ndet\u22121 factor in first approximation.\nThen we arrived to the picture here that the probability distribution over phase\nspace - at some chosen time, that due to Liouville's theorem does not matter - is\ngiven by e\u22122SI [\u03c6sol ] where \u03c6sol is the classical field solution associated with the point\nin phase space for which e\u22122SI [\u03c6sol ] shall be the probability density.\n\n7.4\n\nAbout the effect of SI in the classical approximation\n\nTo appreciate the just given probability density e\u22122SI [\u03c6sol ] over phase space\nP (\u03c6|t0 , \u03a0|t0 ) D\u03c6|t0 D\u03a0|t0 \u221d e\u22122SI [\u03c6sol ] D\u03c6|t0 , D\u03a0|t0\n\n(7.19)\n\none should have in mind that in the classical approximation of the universe developing along a solution \u03c6sol to the equations of motion\n\u03b4SR = 0,\n25\n\n(7.20)\n\n\fthe development is given quite uniquely by the equations of motion. The only place\nin which the imaginary part then comes in is in weighting with various probability\ndensities the various \"initial state data\" (\u03c6|t0 , \u03a0|t0 ) \u2013 i.e. the phase space point\n\u2013. Once you know the initial state of the (sub)system considered the equation of\nmotion determines everything in the classical approximation determined by SR just\ndescribed, the SI gets totally irrelevant. In other words it is only to know something\nabout the \"initial state\" that SI has relevance. Here the usual terminology of \"initial\nstate\" shall especially in our model not be taken too seriously in as far as it with\nthe word \"initial\" refers to a beginning moment, the Big Bang start say. No, as we\njust mentioned one can use any moment of time t0 for the description of the phase\nspace describing the set of classical solutions \u03c6sol . This t0 time does not have to be\nthe first moment \u2013 even if such one should exist \u2013. Rather we can use any moment\nof time as t0 . In the usual theory we would tend to use t0 being the initial moment\nand the state at this moment should then be one of very low entropy describing our\nstart of universe state. However, in our model there is the rather unusual feature\nthat the probability weight e\u22122SI [\u03c6sol ] is given via a functional SI [\u03c6sol ] depending on\nhow the solution \u03c6sol behaves at all different times t and not only at t0 . Since we\nby the classical equations of motion can calculate the whole time development \u03c6sol\nfrom the fields and their conjugate (\u03c6|t0 , \u03a0|t0 ) at some chosen time t0 , we can of\ncourse also consider e\u22122SI [\u03c6sol ] as a function of only the data at t0 , (\u03c6|t0 , \u03a0|t0 ).\nSo it is only by the fact that in our model e\u22122SR [\u03c6sol ] is a rather simple function of\n\u03c6sol and thus because of the often chaotic development of the fields by the classical\nequations of motion typically a complicated function(al) of the time t0 data. With\na more usual model one might think of the initial state in a \"first moment\" t0\nwould be specified by some sort of cosmological model or no boundary condition.\nIn this case the probability density should be rather simple in terms of the first\nmoment data. The simplicity of e\u22122SR [\u03c6sol ] as functional of the \u03c6sol -behavior even at\nlate times to some extend is extremely dangerous for our model showing observable\neffects not observed experimentally. Indeed an especially high probability for initial\nstates leading to a special sort of happenings today say would look as a hand of\nGod effect seeking to arrange just this type of happenings to occur. In practise we\nnever know the state of the universe totally at a moment of time. So there would\nusually be possibilities to adjust a bit the initial conditions. That ciould then in our\n\n26\n\n\fmodel have happened in such a way that events or things to happen in the future\ngets arranged, if it can be done so as to organize especially big e\u22122SR [\u03c6sol ] i.e. an\nespecially low SI . So a priori there would in our model be such \"hand of God effects\".\nIn a later section we shall, however, invent or propose a possible explanation that\ncould make the era of today be of very little significance for the value of SI so that\nin the first approximation it mainly the early time features of a solution that counts\nfor its probability density\ne\u22122SI [\u03c6sol ] \u223c f (\u03c6sol |\"early times\" ) = f (early time part of \u03c6sol )\n\n7.5\n\n(7.21)\n\nRelation to earlier publications\n\nWe have earlier published articles working in the classical approximation seeking to\nproduce a model behind the second law of thermodynamics by assigning a probability P over the phase space of the Universe. It were also there the point that this\nprobability density P in our model should depend in the same way on the state at\nall times. We already proposed that this P were obtained by imposing an imaginary\npart for the action SI . According to the above we clearly have\nP \u221d e\u22122SI .\n\n8\n\n(7.22)\n\nSuggestion of the quantum formula\n\nWe already suggested above that if M denotes a subset of paths, e.g. those taking\nvalues in certain subset of \u03c6|t -configuration space in a moment of time t, then the\nprobability for the true path being in M would be\nR\n| M eiS D\u03c6|2\nProb(M) = R iS\n.\n| e D\u03c6|2\n\n(8.1)\n\nWe imagine the paths to be described by the field \u03c6 as function over R4 , the\nMinkowski space.

So in the case of the in this way approximated future we could\nwrite\n\u2020\n\u2020\nProb(O \u2208 M\u0304) = Tr(PO\u2208M\u0304 U\u2212\u221e to t U\u2212\u221e\nto t )/Tr(U\u2212\u221e to t U\u2212\u221e to t ).\n\n(10.3)\n\nIf O were a variable among the variables used as the path-description in the Feynmann path integral the formula (10.1) would by functional integral be written\nProb(O \u2208 M\u0304) =\n\nR\n\n2\n\nPO\u2208M\u0304 eiS D\u03c6\n.\nR\n2\neiS D\u03c6\n\n(10.4)\n\nStrictly speaking these Feynmann integrals should be summed over all end of time\nconfigurations, but with significant SI presumably this summation would be dominated by a few \"true\" initial and states at \u00b1\u221e and the summation would not be so\nimportant.\nSo strictly speaking we have\n\nProb(O \u2208 M\u0304) =\n\n11\n\nP\n\ninit,final\n\nP\n\nR final\n\ninit,final\n\n2\n\nPO\u2208M\u0304 eiS D\u03c6\n.\nR\n2\neiS D\u03c6\n\ninitial\n\n(10.5)\n\nThe Higgs width broadening\n\nAs an example of application of the SI -caused modification of the usual transition\nmatrices we may consider the decay of a particle \u2013 which we for reasons to be\nexplained below take to be the Weinberg-Salam Higgs particle \u2013 which has from SI\n36\n\n\finduced an imaginary term in the mass (or energy). Let us say take this term to\nhave the effect of delivering a term being a positive constant number multiplied by\n\u2212i in the Hamiltonian. In the Schrodinger equation\ni\n\nd\u03c8\n= H\u03c8\ndt\n\n(11.1)\n\nsuch a term will cause the wave function \u03c8 to decrease with time so that it will\ndecay exponentially with time t. If the particle in addition decays \"normally\" into\ndecay products, say bb\u0304 as the Higgs particles do the exponential decay rate will be\nthe sum \u0393normal + \u0393SI of the SI -induced width \u0393SI and the \"normal\" decay width\n\u0393normal . Let us for simplicity take as an approximation that the real part of the\nmass is very large compared to both the \"normal\" and the SI -induced widths so\nthat we can work effectively non relativistically with a resting Higgs particle. We\ncan let it be produced in a short moment of time which is short compared to the\ninverse widths\n\n1\n\u0393SI\n\nand\n\n1\n\u0393normal\n\nwhile still allowing the particle may be considered at\n\nrest approximately.\nIf we at first used the \"usual\" formula |h\u03c8f |S|\u03c8i|2 for the decay process and\ncalculate the total probability for the particle to decay into anything one will find\n\u0393normal\nbecause the average\n\u0393normal +\u0393SI\n1\nfrom \u0393normal\nto \u0393normal1 +\u0393S . Since of\nI\n\nthat this probability is only\n\nlifetime has been reduced\n\nby this factor, namely\n\ncourse the usual particle\n\nwith \u0393SI = 0 will decay into something with just probability unity, we thus need a\nnormalization factor h\u03c8|S \u2020 S|\u03c8i to rescale the total probability to be (again) unity\nin our imaginary action theory.\nBy Fourier transforming from time t to energy the Higgs decay time distribution\nwe obtain in our model again a Breit-Wigner energy distribution\nP (E) =\n\n\u0393normal + \u0393SI\n\u00112 \u0015\n\u0010\n\u0393\n+\u0393\nS\nnormal\nI\n2\u03c0 (E \u2212 mHiggs )2 +\n2\n\u0014\n\n(11.2)\n\nIf indeed we effectively should have such an SI -induced imaginary part in the\nmass of the Higgs, then the Higgs-width could be made bigger than calculated in\nthe usual width \u0393normal . This is an effect that might have been already seen in the\nLEP-collider provided one has indeed seen some Higgses in this accelerator. Indeed\nthere has been found an excess of Higgs-like events with masses slightly below the\nestablished lower bound for the Higgs mass of 114 GeV/c.\n37\n\n\f11.1\n\nThe effect of the h\u03c8f |\u03c1f from tn |\u03c8f i suppression factor\n\nAs an example of a (perhaps realistic) case of an effect of the factor h\u03c8f |\u03c1f from tn |\u03c8f i\nwe could imagine that two particles are coming together organized to hit head on \u2013\nsay in a relative s-wave - able to potentially form two different resonances of which\nsay one is a Higgs which as above is assumed to have an imaginary term in its mass.\nNow it is easy to see that the \u03c1f from tn (here tn is the moment the collision just\nformed one of the two resonances thought upon as physical objects) will have\nh\u03c8f Higgs |\u03c1f from tn |\u03c8f Higgs i < h\u03c8f all |\u03c1f from tn |\u03c8f all i\n\n(11.3)\n\nwhere |\u03c8f Higgs i and |\u03c8f all i represent respectively the two possible resonances the\nHiggs and the alternative resonance. Compared to the usual calculation of the\ntransition to one of the resonances \u2013 essentially the square of the coupling constant \u2013 the Higgs-resonance will occur with suppressed probability because of the\nh\u03c8|\u03c1f from tn |\u03c8i-factor in the formula (9.11). Really if the collision were safely organized that the collision occurs because of s-wave impact preensured the total\nprobability for one or the other of the two resonances to be formed would be with\nproperly normalized probability 1 because of the h\u03c8|S \u2020 S|\u03c8i normalization factor.\nHowever, the effect of h\u03c8f |\u03c1f from tn |\u03c8f i would be to increase the probability to form\nthe alternative resonance while decreasing the formation of the Higgs.\n\n12\n\nApproaching a more beautiful formulation\n\nTaking the regions in which O may lie or not M\u0304 as infinitesimally extended we\nwould the formula for the probability density in the form\nP\n\n2\n\nR\n\neiS[\u03c6] PO\u2208M\u0304 D\u03c6\ni,f\nBOUNDARY:i,f\nProb(O = O0 ) =\n2\nP R\niS[\u03c6]D\u03c6\ne\n\u2032\n\u2032\ni,f\nBOUNDARY:i ,f\nP R\neiS[\u03c6] \u03b4(O \u2212 O0 )D\u03c6\ni,f\nBOUNDARY:i,f\n\u221d\n2\nP R\niS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\ne\ni,f\nBOUNDARY:i\u2032 ,f \u2032\n\n2\n\n(12.1)\n\nWe may claim that this kind of formula the probability density for finding O\ntaking a value infinitesimally close to O0 is a bit unaestetic because of having the\nprojection operator PO\u2208M\u0304 or the equivalent \u03b4(O \u2212 O0 ) occurring twice while one\n38\n\n\fmight have said it would be simpler to have just one \u03b4(O \u2212 O0 ) or PO\u2208M\u0304 factor in\nthe expression.\nWe should now seek to reformulate our expression with these factors occurring\ntwice into a simpler one with only single occurrence of PO\u2208M\u0304 or \u03b4(O \u2212 O0 ). To\nperform this hoped for derivation we first argue that for nonoverlapping O-value\nregions M\u03041 and M\u03042\nX \u0012Z\ni,f\n\niS[\u03c6]\n\nBOUNDARY:i,f\n\nPO\u2208M\u03041 e\n\n\u0013\u2217 Z\nD\u03c6 *\n\nBOUNDARY:i,f\n\nPO\u2208M\u03042 eiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\n\n\u2248 0 for M\u03041 \u2229 M\u03042 = \u2205 .\n\n(12.2)\n\nThis is argued for by maintaining that giving O a different value at time t very\ntypically by \"butterfly effect\" \u2013 Lyapunov exponent \u2013 will cause very different states\nf and i at \u2213\u221e respectively. If the two factors in (12.2) have very different final f\nand initial i states dominate at the boundaries and even random phases the total\nsum is indeed much smaller than what one would obtain if M\u03041 and M\u03042 were taken\nto be the same region M\u03041 = M\u03042 = M\u0304 . If we now use the zero expression (12.2)\nby adding such terms into the numerator and analogously in the denominator of\n(12.1) we can formulate this expression for the probability of O being in M\u0304 into\nan expression involving a summation over the value or region for O in one of the\noccurrences\nProb(O =\n\n(2)\nO0 )\n\nXZ\n\n=\n\n(1)\ndO0\n\ni,f\n\n*\n\nZ\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u03b4(O \u2212\n\nBOUNDARY:i,f\n\n(1)\nO0 )eiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\n\n(2)\n\nBOUNDARY:i,f\n\n\u03b4(O \u2212 O0 )eiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\n\n.

But in order to\nargue for such removal being possible we would have to speculate say that some \u2013\nwe could say the true \u2013 boundary condition combination for the functional integrals\n(12.7, 12.8) completely dominates. This is actually not at all unrealistic since indeed\nthe SI will tend to very few paths dominate. In such a case of dominance we would\nhave a set of dominant (f, i). Presumably to make the chance that there should be\nsuch dominance we should allow ourselves to be satisfied with a linear combinations\nof i-state and of f -states to dominate. But now if indeed we could do that and call\nthese linear combinations (fdom , idom ), then we could approximate\nR\nOeiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\nBOUNDARY fdom ,idom\nR\n.\nhOi \u2248\neiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\nBOUNDARY fdom ,idom\n\n(12.9)\n\nNow we would like not to have the occurrence in this expression of the rather special\nstates (fdom , idom ). However, these dominant boundary conditions are precisely the\ndominant boundary conditions for the denominator integral, because it were really\n40\n\n\fjust the complex conjugate for the latter for which we looked for the dominant\nboundaries.\nSo if we let the boundaries free then at least the denominator should become\ndominantly just as if we had used the boundaries (fdom , idom ). It even seems that\nbecause of the smoothness and boundedness of the variable O as functional of \u03c6\nthe dominant boundaries (i, f ) should not be much changed by inserting an extra\nfactor O so that also by letting the boundaries free in the numerator functional\nR\nintegral O[\u03c6]eiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6 would not change much the dominant boundaries from those\n\nof the same integral with the O-factor removed. But the removal of this O leads to\nthe denominator functional integral, for which we already saw that the dominating\nboundary behavior were (fdom , idom ). Thus we have argued that we can rewrite\n(12.9) into\nR\nOeiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\nhOi = R iS[\u03c6]\ne\nD\u03c6\n\n(12.10)\n\nwhere it is understood that the boundaries for t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e are \"free\". Then we\nsuggested they would automatically go to be dominated by (fdom , idom ) thus fitting\non to the formulas with double occurrence of \u03b4(O \u2212 O0 )'s.\nThe argumentation that the factor O does not matter for the dominant behavior\nat \u00b1\u221e may sound almost contradictory to our assumption using the \"butterfly\neffect\" to derive the rapid variation of (2.4) which meant that an insertion of \u03b4(O \u2212\nO0 ) would drastically change behavior, including that of the boundary.\nIt is, however, not totally unreasonable that a sharp function \u03b4(O \u2212 O0 ) which\nis zero in most places could modify the boundary conditions, while a smooth one\nO, almost never zero would not modify them. Basically we hope indeed for that\nthe SI -caused weighting is so severely restricting the set of significant paths, that it\npractically means that a single path, \"the realized path\" is selected. In this case the\ninsertion of the factor O into the functional integral would just multiply it by the\nvalue of O on \"realized path\". If you however insert \u03b4(O \u2212 O0 ) and it as most likely\nthe case O0 is not the value of O on the realized path then we kill by the zero-value of\n\u03b4(O \u2212O0 ) at the realized path would totally kill the dominant contribution. Then of\ncourse the possibility for a completely different path is opened and the orthogonality\nused in (12.2) gets realistic.\nAs conclusion of the just delivered derivation of (12.10) we see that the starting\n41\n\n\fpoint in the beginning the articles is indeed consistent under the suggested approximations with the forms derived from the semiclassical start.\n\n13\n\nThe monopole argument for suppressing the\nSI in the Standard Model\n\nWe have already above in section 3 argued that due to the material in the present\nera, and the future too, being either massless or protected from decay by in practice\nconserved quantum numbers and due to weakness of the interactions the contribution\nto SI from these eras must be rather trivial.\nIt were also for the above argument important that the non-zero mass particles\nwere non-relativistic in these eras. That above argument may, however, not be\nsufficient for explaining that no effect of our LI or SI would have been seen so far.\nWe have indeed had several high energy accelerators such as ISR (=intersecting\nstorage ring at CERN) in which massive particles \u2013 such as protons \u2013 have been\nbrought to run for days with relativistic speeds. That means that they would during\nthis running in the storage rings say have had eigentime contributions significantly\nlower than the coordinate time or rather the time on earth. This would presumably\neasily have given significant contributions to SI which going to the exponent would\nsuppress \u2013 or priori perhaps enhance \u2013 the probability of developments, solutions,\nto equations of motion, leading to the running of such storage rings. Since the\nprotons have not already been made to run around dominantly relativistically we\nshould deduce that most likely the storage rings would lead to increasing SI and thus\nlowering of the probability weight. Thus one would expect that the initial conditions\nshould have been so adjusted as to prevent funding for this kind of accelerators, at\nleast for them running long time. Contrary to Higgs producing accelerators which\nhave so far not been able to work on big scale (may be L.E.P. produced a few\nHiggses for a short time) the accelerators with relativistic massive particles have\nseemingly worked without especially bad luck. In order to rescue our model it seems\ntherefore needed to invent a crutch for it of the type that there are actually no LI contributions involving the particles for which the massive relativistically running\naccelerators have been realized. We have actually two mechanisms to offer which at\nthe end can argue away our LI or SI effects for all the hitherto humanly produced\n42\n\n\for found particles, leaving the hopes for finding observable effects \u2013 bad luck for\naccelerators, mysterious broadening of resonance peaks \u2013 to experiments involving\nthe Higgs particle or particles outside the Standard Model. The point is indeed that\nwe shall argue away the effects of SI for gauge particles and for Fermions (coupled\nto them).\nThe suppression rules to be argue for are:\n1) Supposing the existence of monopoles we deduce that the corresponding full\ngauge coupling constants must be real, basically as a consequence of the Dirac\nrelation.\n2) For fields which like the Fermion fields in renormalizable theories occur homogeneously in the Lagrangian density LR + iLI this Lagrangian density can be\nshown to be zero by inserting the equations of motion.\n\n13.1\n\nSpelling out the suppression rules\n\nSpelling out a bit the suppression rules let us for the monopole based argument\nremind the reader that although we consider a complex Lagrangian density LR +\niLI for instance the electric and magnetic fields and the four potential A\u03bc (x) for\nelectrodynamics are still real as usual. Now if we have fundamental monopoles\nthere must exist corresponding Dirac strings which, however, as is well known must\nbe unphysical. The explicit flux in the Dirac string must to have the Dirac string\nunobservable \u2013 to be unphysical \u2013 be compensated by an at the string singular\nbehavior of the four potential A\u03bc around the Dirac string. The singular flux to\ncompensate the extra flux in the Dirac string can, however, only be real since the\nH\nA\u03bc -field is real and it is given by a curve integral A\u03bc dx\u03bc around the Dirac string.\n\nNow as is well known the fluxes mentioned equal the monopole charges. Thus the\nmonopole charge g must be real. But then the Dirac relation\neg = 2\u03c0n,\n\nn\u2208Z\n\n(13.1)\n\ntells that also the electric charge e must be real. Now, however, in the formalism\nwith the electric charge absorbed into the four potential \u00c2\u03bc = eA\u03bc the coefficient\n2\non the F\u03bc\u03bd\n-term in the Lagrangian density is \u2212 4e12 so that the pure electromagnetic,\n\n43\n\n\fkinetic, Lagrangian density\n(LR + iLL )\n\npure e.m.\n\n=\u2212\n\n1 2\nF\n4e2 \u03bc\u03bd\n\n(13.2)\n\nbecomes totally real. I.e.\nLL |pure e.m. = 0.\n\n(13.3)\n\nWe may skip or postpone a similar argument for non-abelian, Yang Mills, theories\nto another paper, but really you may just think of some abelian subgroup and make\nuse of gauge invariance.\nConcerning the rule 2) for homogeneously occurring fields, such as the Fermion\nfields in renormalizable theories the trick is to use the equations of motion. For\nexample the part of the Lagrangian density LR +iLI involving a Fermion field \u03c8 is of\nthe form LF = Z * \u03c8\u0304(iD\n/\u2212m)\u03c8 where Z is a constant and D\u03bc the covariant derivative\nand of course D\n/ = \u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc . This Fermionic Lagrangian density is homogeneous of rank\ntwo in the Fermion field \u03c8. The Euler-Lagrange equations, the equations of motion\nfor the Fermion fields are derived from functional differentiation w.r.t. the field \u03c8\n\u03b4S\n=0\n\u03b4\u03c8(x)\n\n(13.4)\n\nand end up giving equations of motion of the form\n\u2202LF\n=0\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(13.5)\n\n\u2202LF\n=0\n\u2202 \u03c8\u0304\n\n(13.6)\n\nor\n\n(really these forms are only trustable modulo total divergences but that is enough)\nleading as is well known to\n\u03c8\u0304(iD\n/ \u2212 m) = 0\n\n(13.7)\n\n(iD\n/ \u2212 m)\u03c8 = 0.\n\n(13.8)\n\nor\n\nBut now it is a general rule that a homogeneous expression, LF say, can be recovered\nfrom its partial derivatives\nX \u2202LF\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n\u03c8+\n\nX \u2202LF\n= rank * LF\n\u03c8\u0304\n\u2202 \u03c8\u0304\n44\n\n(13.9)\n\n\fwhere rank is in the present case rank= 2. Such a recovering for homogeneous Lagrangian densities, however, means that the Lagrangian density \u2013 at least modulo\ntotal divergences \u2013 can be expressed by the equation of motions, which are zero,\nif obeyed. But then at least in the classical approximation the Lagrangian density\nis zero at least modulo total divergences. This means that the total SR + iSI contribution from the just discussed homogeneous terms end up zero. Especially the\nimaginary part also ends up zero, although its form does not have to be zero. It is\nonly insertion of equations of motion that makes it zero.\n\n14\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have put up a formalism for a non-unitary model based on extending the Lagrangian and thereby the action to be complex by allowing complex coefficients in\nthe Lagrangian density LR + iLI .\nWe used two starting points for how to extract probabilities and expectation\nvalues from the Feynmann path way integral in our ambitious model that shall even\nbe able to tell what really happens rather than just the equations of motion. The\nfirst were the interpretation that an operator O(t) should have the expectation value\nR\nO(t)eiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\nhOi = R iS[\u03c6]\n(14.1)\ne\nD\u03c6\n\nbut this expression is a bit dangerous in as far as it is a priori not guaranteed to\nbe real even though the quantity O(t) is real. The second approach would rather\nhave a series of projections onto small regions M\u0304i for operator Oi (ti ) denoted POi \u2208M\u0304i\n\ninserted into the functional integral but then this integral is numerically squared for\nany combination (i, f ) of boundary behaviors at respectively \u2212\u221e and +\u221e times.\nR\nThat is to say that the insertions are to be performed into the integral eiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6\nRQ\niS[\u03c6]\nso as to replace the latter by\nD\u03c6 just as in the first approach, but\ni POi \u2208M\u0304i e\n\nthen one forms the numerical square summed over the initial i and final f behaviors\n\u0013\u2217 Z\nX \u0012Z\niS[\u03c6]\ne\nD\u03c6\neiS[\u03c6] D\u03c6.\n(14.2)\ni,f\n\nBOUNDARY:i,f\n\nBOUNDARY:i,f\n\nThe probability distribution is then obtained by inserting the projection operators into both factors in (14.2) and then as normalization divide the (14.2) having\nthese insertion with (14.2) not having the insertions.\n45\n\n\fUnder some suggestive assumptions we argued that the two approaches approximately will agree with each other. The most important formula derived is presumably the formula to replace usual unitary S-matrix or U -matrix transition between\ntwo moments in time in our model. This formula turns out for transition an initial\nstate |\u03c8i to a final |\u03c8f i to be\n|h\u03c8f |S|\u03c8i|2h\u03c8f |\u03c1f from tf |\u03c8f i\nProd(|\u03c8f i, |\u03c8i) =\nh\u03c8|S \u2020S|\u03c8i\n\n(14.3)\n\nWe used that to derive the broadening in our model of the Higgs-width.\nAs an outlook we may mention some of the expectations of our model used\nin a more classical language in our earlier publications: If the Higgs \u2013 especially\nfreely running Higgses - decrease significantly the probabilty (7.21) then the initial\nstate should be organized so that Higgs production be largely avoided. This would\nactually make the prediction that some how or the other an accident will happen and\nthe LHC-accelerator will be prevented from comming to full energy and luminosoty.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge the Niels Bohr Institute (Copenhagen) and Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics for their hospitality extended to one of them each.
