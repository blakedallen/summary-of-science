Optical data were obtained with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m Telescope (RTT150). Nine X-ray sources were identified as active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

Other AGNs are observed as stellar-like nuclei\nof spiral galaxies, with broad emission lines in their spectra.\nFor the majority of our hard X-ray selected AGNs, their hard X-ray luminosities are well-correlated with the\nluminosities in [OIII],5007 optical emission line. However, the luminosities of some AGNs deviate from this\ncorrelation. The fraction of these objects can be as high as 20%.

Here we discuss the results of\nthese observations in more detail.\n\nThe all-sky surveys in hard X-rays give a valuable\ninformation on the populations of objects, which are\ndifficult to observe due to the presence of absorption\nin optical and soft X-rays. The most sensitive to date\nare recently completed RXTE (XSS, Revnivtsev et al.,\n2004) and INTEGRAL (Krivonos et al., 2007) allsky surveys, and on-going SWIFT all-sky survey\n(Tueller et al., 2007).\nThese surveys contains a large number of known\nnearby active galactic nuclei (AGNs), cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, located in Galactic plane. However, it turns out, that a considerable number of\nsources, up to 20\u201330% of their total number, can not be\nidentified with previously known objects. In order to\nmake a complete use of the capabilities of these surveys\nfor statistical studies, one need to identify all the Xray sources with optical objects and to determine their\nnature.\nThe work on optical identifications of hard X-ray\nsources from the all-sky surveys was started on RussianTurkish 1.5-m Telescope (RTT150) (Bikmaev et al.,\n2006a,b).\nIn this paper we present the results\non the extragalactic objects - active galactic nuclei, obtained in frames of this work during Autumn 2006 \u2013 Spring 2007. Some of these results\nwere immediately published in astronomical circulars\n* e-mail:\n\nOBSERVATIONS\nA characteristic property of X-ray telescopes on\nboard INTEGRAL and SWIFT observatories is that\ntheir accuracy of the localization of X-ray sources, in\nmany cases, is insufficient to unambiguously associate\nthe X-ray source with a certain object in optical band.\nThe error box of INTEGRAL and SWIFT hard X-ray\nsources usually is about few arcminutes. When observing in optical band, even at high Galactic latitudes, one\nwill find a considerable number of galaxies and stars in\nthe error box of that size. At low Galactic latitudes, the\nfield of that size contain so large number of stars, that\nit is impossible to directly associate the X-ray source\nwith any optical object.\nIn order to obtain more accurate positions of hard\nX-ray sources one can use the observations in softer Xray band, where the positions of X-ray sources can be\nmeasured much more accurately. First, one can use the\ndata of ROSAT All-Sky Survey (Voges et al., 1999). In\ncase of strongly absorbed X-ray sources, which are not\ndetected in ROSAT All-Sky Survey, one can use the\ndata of pointed observation of Chandra, XMM -Newton\ntelescopes or X-ray telescope aboard SWIFT, in harder\nX-ray band.\nThe data for some hard X-ray sources were obtained\n\nrodion@hea.iki.rssi.ru\n\n0\n\n\fNew AGNs among INTEGRAL and SWIFT X-ray sources\nin dedicated Chandra observations (Sazonov et al.,\n2005, 2008). An extensive program of observations of\nSWIFT and INTEGRAL hard X-ray sources is also\ncarried out with SWIFT X-ray telescope (XRT, see,\ne.g., Tueller et al., 2007). We downloaded all necessary\nadditional open data from HEASARC 1 archive.\nFor our optical observations we first selected the hard\nX-ray sources, with the positional accuracy enhanced\nin one or another way. All optical data were obtained\nwith Russian-Turkish 1.5-m Telescope (RTT150), using\nmedium and low resolution spectrometer TFOSC 2 . In\nmost cases we used 54 mkm slit, which corresponds to\n0.96\u2032\u2032 size in the sky. We mostly used grism #15, which\ngive the best throughput and the most wide spectral\ncoverage (3500\u20139000 \u00c5). In this setup, the spectral resolution was \u2248 12 \u00c5 (FWHM). In those cases, where we\nneeded higher spectral resolution, we used other grisms.\nThe data were reduces using standard IRAF 3 software.\nRESULTS\nThe list of X-ray sources, which we were able to identify in Autumn 2006 \u2013 Spring 2007, is presented in Table 1. In the Table for each X-ray source we give its\nname, coordinates, R magnitude, type of the object and\nredshift. The coordinates are given in 2000 epoch, using USNO B1.0 catalog (Monet et al., 2003) as a reference frame. For nearby galaxies we give the coordinates\nof active nuclei or the maximum of emission near the\ncenter of the galaxy, where the optical spectrum was\nobtained. R band magnitudes are given for reference\nand are taken from USNO-B1.0 catalog. The designation of object types are as follows: Sy1,2 - Seyfert\ngalaxy of type 1 or 2; BL Lac - BL Lacertae object.\nThe AGNs redshifts were measured using only narrow\nlines, like [OIII] 4959,5007, [NI] 5199, [OI] 6300, [SII]\n6716,6731, and also in some cases [OII] 3727, [NeIII]\n3869 and narrow parts of Balmer lines. The errors of z\nmeasurement should not be larger than 0.0001.\nThe finding charts, where the arrows show the optical objects identified with hard X-ray sources, are\nshown in Fig. 1. For the sources IGR J01528\u22120326 and\nIGR J02343+3229 the arrow show the position of the\nslit of the spectrometer. In the charts we show the direct images in r\u2032 filter (SDSS ), obtained with RTT150\ntelescope. In case of X-ray source IGR J16562\u22123301,\nwhen we not able to obtain the direct image of sufficient quality, the image taken from DSS-II red plate is\nshown.\nFig. 2 shows spectra of optical objects, which were\nused to identify the types of the objects. All spectra are converted to physical fluxes, using the observations of spectrophotometric standard stars from the\n1 http://heasarc.nasa.gov/\n2 http://astroa.physics.metu.edu.tr/tug/tfosc.html\n3 http://iraf.noao.edu\n\n1\n\nlist of Massey et al. (1988). In cases of nearby galaxies MCG \u221201\u221205\u2212047 and NGC 973 (X-ray sources\nIGR J01528\u22120326 and IGR J02343+3229), only small\nfraction of the flux of the central parts of the galaxies fall into the slit of the spectrometer. This produce\nthe uncertainty of the photometric calibration of the\nemission line flux, because the real angular size of the\nline emitting region is unknown. For this objects we\ncorrected the flux for the slit size, assuming that the\nangular radius of the emitting region is equal to 9\u2032\u2032 and\n12\u2032\u2032 correspondingly, where the angular sizes are taken\nso that we obtain the upper estimate of the flux in emission lines. In other cases the slit size correction was\napplied, assuming that the source is point-like, which\nis a good approximation, since all the other AGNs have\nthe stellar-like nuclei.\nDue to the uncertainty of photometrical conditions\nduring our observations, photometric calibration may\ncontain significant systematic errors, especially in blue\npart of the spectrum \u03bb < 5500 \u00c5. The spectra in Fig. 2\nare not corrected for the Galactic interstellar extinction. The spectrum of X-ray source IGR J16562\u22123301\nis shown in CCD counts, because it was observed at\nvery large zenith angles and the overall form of its spectrum is strongly distorted.\nNotes on individual objects\nIGR J01528\u22120326 - The source is unambiguously identified with nearby edge-on spiral galaxy\nMCG \u221201\u221205\u2212047. Optical spectrum of the central part of the galaxy shows narrow emission lines\nH\u03b1 , [NII],6583 and [SII],6716.\nFrom the intensity ratio lg([NII], 6583/H\u03b1 ) \u2248 0, we conclude that\nthis source most probably is a Seyfert 2 AGN\n(Veilleux and Osterbrock, 1987).\nIGR J02343+3229 - The source is identified with\nnearby edge-on spiral galaxy NGC973. Optical spectrum of the central part of the galaxy shows narrow emission lines [OIII],5007, H\u03b1 , [NII],6583 and\n[SII],6716. The emission lines intensity ratios can\nbe estimated as lg([OIII], 5007/H\u03b2 ) > 0.7 and\nlg([NII], 6583/H\u03b1 ) \u2248 0.4. Therefore, this source is most\nprobably a Seyfert 2 AGN (Veilleux and Osterbrock,\n1987).\nIGR J03334+3718 - The source was detected also\nin ROSAT All-Sky Survey (1RXS J033316.2+371815),\nwhich allow to measure more accurate position with\nthe error circle \u2248 10\u2032\u2032 . After that this source is unambiguously identified with the galaxy with stellar-like\nnucleus.

Using the same X-ray data we\ndetermine even more accurate position of this source.\nSystematic uncertainty of XRT aspect solution was\nstrongly reduced using two other X-ray sources which\nwere identified with two relatively bright stars in optical\nband (Burenin et al., 2007). In this way we obtain the\nfollowing X-ray source coordinates \u03b1, \u03b4: 16:56:16.82,\n\u221233:02:12.5 (J2000, here the astrometry was done relative to UCAC2 catalog). The positional error here\nshould be almost purely statistical and is about 1.5\u2032\u2032 .\nThese coordinates agree with the position of very\nbright radio source NVSS J165616-330211 (the flux is\nabout 0.4 Jy at 1.4 GHz). The coordinates of the only\noptical object, which is coincide with both X-ray and\nradio sources, are given in Table 1. In the optical spectrum of this object there are no bright emission lines\n(Fig. 2). All these data allow to conclude, that this\nsource is a BL Lacertae object. In order to measure its\nredshift, the spectrum with much higher signal-to-noise\nratio is needed.\nSWIFT J1745.4+2906, SWIFT J1930.5+3414,\n1RXSJ193347.6+325422 - These hard X-ray sources\nwere detected by SWIFT observatory.

However, this object was not included in NED database, and we identified this object\nindependently. In Table 1 we provide more accurate\nredshift, as compared to that published by Motch et al.\n(1997). Apart of the galactic nucleus, there is another\none stellar like object in the image of the galaxy (see\nFig. 1).

The\nfluxes in X-rays are taken from the catalogs of INTEGRAL and SWIFT all-sky surveys (Krivonos et al.,\n2007; Tueller et al., 2007). In last case the fluxes were\nconverted to 17\u201360 keV band assuming power law spectrum with photon index \u0393 = 1.8. There is no X-ray\nflux for the source 1RXS J193347.6+325422 in Table 2,\nbecause this source is not included in current version\nof SWIFT survey catalog. The fluxes in [OIII],5007\nemission line are corrected for the Galactic interstellar\nextinction using data from Schlegel et al. (1998).\nIn Fig. 3 we show the relation between the luminosities in 17\u201360 keV X-ray band and in [OIII],5007 line.\nHere we also add the data for AGNs, which we optically identified earlier (Bikmaev et al., 2006a). The\ndata for the main part of AGNs are well agree with\nthe known correlation (see, e.g., Heckman et al., 2005).\nExcluding three lower points in Fig. 3, we find that\nthe mean and the dispersion of the luminosities ratio\nlogarithm are equal 2.13 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.27 respectively,\nin good agreement with the results for AGNs, selected\nmainly in optical band (Heckman et al., 2005).\nIn contrast to optically selected AGNs, our sample contain AGNs with much lower luminosity [OIII]\nline, as should be expected for their X-ray luminosities.\nFirst, these are two nearby AGNs in\nMCG \u221201\u221205\u2212047 and NGC 973, nearly exactly edgeon galaxies. As it was noted above, in the calibrations\nof their spectra there is a considerable uncertainty, due\nto the unknown angular size of the line emitting region.\nHowever, their spectra were calibrated so that to obtain an upper estimate of [OIII] line fluxes (see above)\nand the lack of luminosity in this line should exist anyway. Most probably, this lack of luminosity in [OIII]\nline is explained by the extinction in the disks of the\ngalaxies, since in these two cases the galaxies are turned\n4 To convert fluxes into the luminosities we use the cosmological model with \u03a9 = 0.3, \u039b = 0.7, H0 = 71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n\n\fNew AGNs among INTEGRAL and SWIFT X-ray sources\n\n7\n\nlg L[OIII],5007\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nlg LX,17\u221260 keV\nFig. 3.

Dashed line show the\ndependency lg LX /L[OIII] = 2.13 (see text).\n\nnearly exactly edge-on. From the observed thickness of\nthe disk, we estimate that the size of absorbed region\nshould not be larger than \u22481 kpc.\nIn Fig. 3 the point, correspondent to the AGN in hard\nX-ray source IGR J13038+5348, is also shifted down. In\nthe optical image of this source (Fig. 1) on can see that\nhere the galaxy is also approximately edge-on. However, in the optical spectrum of this object there are\nbroad Balmer lines. Probably, the other mechanisms of\nthe weakening of narrow forbidden lines are in effect in\nthis case.\nIn their work Heckman et al. (2005) conclude, that\nAGN samples, selected using [OIII] emission line flux\nare as complete as those selected in hard X-rays. In\nour work we are faced on with few cases, where the\nlogarithm of the [OIII] line and hard X-ray luminosities\nratio was significantly lower than \u2248 2.1. These objects\nshould modify the selection of AGN using their flux in\n[OIII] line and change the form of the AGN luminosity\nfunction in [OIII] line as compared to that in hard Xrays. The fraction of these AGNs may be less than\n\u223c 20% (as it follows from Fig. 3), since here we consider\nonly, probably, most absorbed AGNs, which were not\nknown earlier and were detected only using observations\nin hard X-rays.\n\nIn this paper we present our new results of the\nobservations of the fields of unidentified hard X-ray\nsources, detected in statistically complete all-sky surveys. The observations were carried out using RussianTurkish 1.5-m Telescope (RTT150). Nine X-ray sources\nwere identified with the active galactic nuclei. Two\nof them are hosted by nearby, nearly exactly edgeon, spiral galaxies MCG \u221201\u221205\u2212047 and NGC 973.\nOne source, IGR J16562\u22123301, is most probably BL\nLac object (blazar). Other AGNs are observed as\nstellar-like nuclei of spiral galaxies, with broad emission\nlines in their spectra. All of them, excluding probably\nIGR J16562\u22123301, are nearby objects - their redshifts\nare z < 0.1, as for the majority of AGNs in INTEGRAL\nAll-Sky Survey. Almost all of them are located at high\nGalactic latitudes |b| > 5\u25e6 .\nTaking in account the data, which we obtained earlier\n(Bikmaev et al., 2006a), we show, that the luminosities\nin hard X-rays (17\u201360 keV) and in [OIII],5007 emission line, lg LX /L[OIII] \u2248 2.1, are well correlated, as\nexpected, for the majority of AGNs selected in hard\nX-rays. However, few AGNs considerably deviate from\nthis correlation. For example, the flux in [OIII] line\nturns to be lower in AGNs in two nearby edge-on spiral\ngalaxies MCG \u221201\u221205\u2212047 and NGC 973, which can\nbe explained by the extinction in their galactic disk.\nThe fraction of AGNs, for which the [OIII] line fluxes\nare significantly deviate from that correlation, may be\nabout 20%, which should significantly modify [OIII] line\nAGN selection and the form of the AGN luminosity\nfunction in [OIII] line as compared to that in hard Xrays.\nIn result of the recent works on optical identifications\nof hard X-ray sources (e.g., Bikmaev et al., 2006a,b;\nMasetti et al., 2006, and also this work), the catalog of\nINTEGRAL All-Sky Survey (Krivonos et al., 2007) is\nnow almost complete at high Galactic latitudes. Now\nthere are only few X-ray sources, which remain optically unidentified, in this catalog at Galactic latitudes\n|b| > 5\u25e6 . At the same time, only in subsample of AGNs\nfrom this survey, 33 out of 127 objects were unknown\nbefore the survey was started (Sazonov et al., 2007).\nAt low Galactic latitudes there are few tens of hard\nX-ray sources from INTEGRAL survey, which are not\noptically identified yet. We will continue our works on\ntheir optical identifications. Optical objects, associated\nwith some of these objects turn to be too faint for the\nobservations with RTT150. Now we submitted the proposals to observe these fainter objects with larger telescopes.\nThis work is supported by grants RFFI 05-0216540, RFFI 07-02-01004, NSh-784.2006.2 and NSh1100.2006.2, and also with programs of Russian\nASTRONOMY LETTERS\n\nVol. 34\n\nNo. 0\n\n2008\n\n\f8\n\nBurenin et al.\n\nacademy of sciences P-04 and OFN-17.\nNote: When this paper was already accepted for publication we have noticed that one of our hard X-ray\nsources IGR J16562\u22123301 was independently identified\nas BL Lacertae object by Masetti et al.
