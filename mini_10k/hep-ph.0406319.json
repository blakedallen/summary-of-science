When the values of the time-averaged\ntransport coefficient q\u0302 exceed 5 GeV2 /fm, RAA (pT ) gradually loses its sensitivity to the\ncorresponding produced energy density.

The centrality dependence of this effect, the\ncorresponding suppression in leading back-to-back correlations [7], and the moderate\nenhancement and opposite centrality dependence observed in the same pT -range in\nd+Au collisions [8, 9] are strong indications that the suppression is predominantly a\nfinal state effect in which the energy of high-pT particles is degraded depending on\nthe in-medium pathlength and the density of the produced medium. Formation time\narguments [10] imply that for pT > 5 \u2212 7 GeV, this energy loss is of partonic origin\nwhile hadronization occurs outside the partonic medium. This is also supported by the\ndisappearance of the particle species dependence of the suppression for pT > 5\u22127 GeV.\nIn this high-pT regime, the suppression of hadrons is widely regarded as a \"hard probe\"\nfor the characterization of the energy density of the medium produced in nucleusnucleus collisions. Recent studies, based on medium-induced radiative parton energy\nloss [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], quote time-dependent energy densities which at time \u03c40 = 0.2\nfm/c after the collision lie a factor O(100) above the energy density of cold nuclear\nmatter [17, 18].\nIn this paper, we calculate the nuclear modification factor for high-pT hadronic\nspectra in nuclear collisions,\nRAA (pT , y) =\n\nd2 N AA /dpT dy\n.\nhTAA ic d2 \u03c3 N N /dpT dy\n\n(1)\n\nHere, hTAA ic is the standard nuclear overlap function, calculated as the average in\nthe measured centrality class. In the absence of nuclear or medium effects, RAA \u2261 1.\nThe starting point of our calculation is the collinearly factorized leading order (LO)\nperturbative QCD formalism which reproduces the shape of the hadronic high-pT spectrum d2 \u03c3 N N /dpT dy in proton-proton collisions at RHIC energies [19]. Our discussion\nwill be limited to pT & 5 GeV. In the calculation of the charged hadron spectrum\nd2 N AA /dpT dy in this range, we include both initial and final state effects. Nuclear\nmodifications to parton distribution functions are taken from the EKS98 parametrization [20] and isospin effects are included as in [19]. As a medium effect, we consider partonic final state energy loss, which is introduced via the quenching weights\nPf (\u2206E, L, q\u0302) calculated in Ref. [21]. The quenching weights will be discussed in more\ndetail in section 2.1. They denote the probability that a hard parton f radiates an\nadditional medium-induced amount of energy \u2206E if it propagates through a medium\nof length L. The quenching weight depends on the transport coefficient q\u0302 which is\ndetermined by the average transverse momentum squared transferred to the projectile parton per unit pathlength, q\u0302 = hqT2 i/\u03bb. It characterizes the energy density of\nthe medium, q\u0302 \u221d \u01eb3/4 [22]. With this input, the hadron spectrum in nucleus-nucleus\n1\n\n\fcollisions reads schematically\nX AA\u2192f +X\n(vac)\nAA\u2192h+X\nd\u03c3(vac)\n\u2297 Pf (\u2206E, L, q\u0302) \u2297 Df \u2192h (z, \u03bc2F ) .\nd\u03c3(med)\n=\n\n(2)\n\nf\n\nHere,\nAA\u2192f +X\nd\u03c3(vac)\n=\n\nX\nijk\n\nfi/A (x1 , Q2 ) \u2297 fj/A (x2 , Q2 ) \u2297 \u03c3\u0302ij\u2192f +k\n\n(3)\n\nand fi/A (x, Q2 ) are the nuclear parton distribution functions and \u03c3ij\u2192f +k the perturbatively calculable partonic cross sections.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give details of the formalism used\nto compute hadron spectra with parton energy loss. Results for Au+Au collisions at\n\u221a\nsNN = 200 GeV are presented in Section 3 and predictions for the LHC are given in\nSection 4. In Section 5, we discuss the nuclear modification factor for Au+Au collisions\n\u221a\nat intermediate energy sNN = 62.4 GeV, where data are just being analyzed. In\nSection 6, we discuss in detail how the main model parameter of our analysis, the\ntime-averaged transport coefficient q\u0302, is related to the energy density produced in the\nmedium. The main conclusions are summarized in Section 7. The results for RHIC\nand for the LHC are further explored in Appendix A.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nFramework\nQuenching weights\n\nUnder the assumption that multiple gluons are emitted independent of each other, the\nprobability that a parton loses an amount \u2206E of its energy by medium-induced gluon\nradiation is [23],\n\" n Z\n#\n!\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\n\u221e\nn\nX\nX\n1 Y\ndI\ndI(\u03c9i )\nP (\u2206E) =\n\u03b4 \u2206E \u2212\n\u03c9i exp \u2212 d\u03c9\n. (4)\nd\u03c9i\nn! i=1\nd\u03c9\nd\u03c9\nn=0\ni=1\nThis probability distribution has been calculated and tabulated [21] for the mediumdI\ninduced gluon energy distribution \u03c9 d\u03c9\nof a hard parton. [In the present study, we use\na probability distribution calculated with \u03b1S = 0.5 instead of \u03b1S = 1/3. Since \u2206E \u221d\n\u03b1s q\u0302, the dependence on the value of the coupling constant can be largely absorbed in\na rescaling of q\u0302.] The calculation of Ref. [21] was done in two approximations which\ndiffer in viewing the medium as a source of many soft [12, 13, 14] or a few hard [14, 15]\nmomentum transfers, respectively. For the purpose of the present study, the small\nnumerical differences between both approximations are not important [21]. We use the\nsoft multiple scattering approximation, where the quenching weights P (\u2206E) depend\non the parton species (light quark or gluon), the in-medium pathlength L and the\n2\n\n\ftransport coefficient q\u0302. For a static medium, q\u0302 does not show a time-dependence.\nExtension and density of the medium can be expressed in terms of the characteristic\ngluon frequency \u03c9c = 12 q\u0302L2 and the dimensionless quantity R = \u03c9c L.\n\nFigure 1: Continuous part of the quenching weights for light quarks (upper row) and gluons\n(lower row) computed in the multiple soft scattering approximation with \u03b1S = 0.5.\nIn general, the density of the medium decreases strongly in time due to longitudinal\nand transverse expansion. Hence, the transport coefficient should be time-dependent.\ndI\nHowever, the gluon energy distribution \u03c9 d\u03c9\nfor a time-dependent transport coefficient\nq\u0302\u03c4 agrees with the energy distribution obtained for an equivalent static linear lineaveraged transport coefficient [24, 25]\nZ \u03c40 +L\n2\n\u03c4 q\u0302\u03c4 (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 .\n(5)\nq\u0302 = 2\nL \u03c40\nHere, \u03c40 is the time at which the parton is produced and for \u03c40 \u226a L, the \u03c40 -dependence\nof q\u0302 is numerically negligible. This allows us to base our analysis on an equivalent static\nscenario and to translate afterwards with Eq. (5) the values for the time-averaged q\u0302\ninto time-dependent transport coefficients .\nThe probability distribution P (\u2206E/\u03c9c , R) consists of a discrete and a continuous\npart (see Figs. 1 and 2)\nP (\u2206E/\u03c9c , R) = p0 (R)\u03b4(\u2206E/\u03c9c ) + p(\u2206E/\u03c9c , R) .\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fFigure 2: Discrete part of the quenching weights for light quarks and gluons computed in\nthe multiple soft scattering approximation with \u03b1S = 0.5.\n\nThe continuous part denotes the probability to lose an additional energy \u2206E due to\nmedium induced gluon radiation. The discrete contribution p0 is the finite probability\nfor the projectile to escape the collision region of finite size and finite opacity without\nfurther interaction [24]. The quenching weight P (\u2206E/\u03c9c , R) is normalized to unity,\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nd(\u2206E/\u03c9c )P (\u2206E/\u03c9c , R) = p0 (R) +\nd(\u2206E/\u03c9c )p(\u2206E/\u03c9c , R) = 1 .\n(7)\n0\n\n0\n\nP (\u2206E/\u03c9c , R) is a generalized probability. It can take negative values since it describes\na medium-induced redistribution of gluon radiation which - compared to the gluon\nradiation in the vacuum - can be reduced in some range of phase space [26].\nThe quenching weights are computed in the eikonal limit of very large initial parton\nenergy Ei . For the case of realistic initial parton energies, finite energy corrections\nhave to be taken into account. In the absence of a formalism which includes them a\npriori, this is done by ensuring with kinematic cuts that the probability distribution\nP (\u2206E/\u03c9c , R) has weight only in the range \u2206E < Ei [23, 27, 28, 29]. To illustrate\nthe theoretical uncertainty associated with finite energy corrections, we shall compare\nresults without such corrections to results obtained from the reweighted ('rw') probability [28]\nPrw (\u2206E/\u03c9c , R) = R Ei /\u03c9c\n0\n\nP (\u2206E/\u03c9c , R)\nd(\u2206E/\u03c9c )P (\u2206E/\u03c9c , R)\n\n\u0398(1 \u2212 \u2206E/Ei ) .\n\nWe consider the non-reweighted result for the ratio RAA as a lower limit.\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fNumerically, we have checked that the effect of reweighting (8) is comparable to the\nfinite energy corrections in other approaches [27] where kinematic cuts are imposed\non the level of the gluon energy distribution by multiplying with the vacuum splitting\nfunction.\n\n2.2\n\nHadron spectra with parton energy loss\n\nWe first discuss the nuclear geometry entering the calculation of the nuclear modification factor (1). The centrality dependence is taken into account by defining an effective\nnucleus Aeff for which the number of participants in central Aeff + Aeff collision equals\nAA\nhNpart\nic . Here, the number of participants is obtained from an optical Glauber analysis\nwith realistic Wood-Saxon (WS) profile for the centrality class c [30]. As far as energy\nloss is concerned, the Aeff nucleus is assumed to be cylindrical and uniform, but we\ncorrect the final spectra for the difference between TAcyleff Aeff (0) and TAWS\n(0).\neff Aeff\nThe partons produced at midrapidity y = 0 propagate in the transverse plane.\nConsider a parton which is produced at a position ~s = (s, \u03c6S ) with respect to the\ntransverse coordinates and which propagates in the transverse direction given by the\nangle \u03c6L . Its angle of propagation with respect to ~s is \u03c6LS = \u03c6L \u2212 \u03c6S . The geometrical\ntransverse path length Lgeom for this parton is\nq\n2\nLgeom (s, \u03c6LS ) = \u2212s cos \u03c6LS + s2 cos \u03c6LS 2 + RA\n\u2212 s2 ,\n(9)\neff\n\nwhere RAeff is the radius of Aeff . We assume that significant energy loss occurs only\nin the dense QGP-phase whose estimated lifetime \u03c4QGP may be shorter than Lgeom .\nTherefore the in-medium path length which enters the quenching weight (5) is chosen\nto be L = min(Lgeom , Lcut \u223c \u03c4QGP ). Varying Lcut will turn out to be a useful tool to\nestablish to what extent particle emission is surface dominated.\nWe compute the inclusive production of charged particles at midrapidity in the\nframework of factorized leading-order partonic cross sections, using nuclear parton distributions, fragmentation functions and quenching weights but no intrinsic transverse\nmomenta. As in [19] the renormalization and factorization scales are set to \u03bc = Q = qT\nand fragmentation scale to \u03bcF = pT , where qT and pT are the transverse momentum\nof the parton and hadron, respectively. We use CTEQ5 parton distributions [31] with\nnuclear effects for Aeff from EKS98 [20], and KKP fragmentation functions [32]. The\np + p reference spectra are obtained as in [19].\nThe inclusive cross section for the production of a parton of flavour f and an initial\ntransverse momentum qTi and rapidity yi is given e.g. in Eqs. (4) and (5) of [19].\nWhen traversing a medium, the parton will lose a fraction \u01eb of its initial energy Ei ,\nbut it will not change significantly the direction of its trajectory, \u03c6i \u2261 \u03c6LS .

This centrality class\ncorresponds to the head-on collision of an effective nucleus of size Aeff = 181.\nIn Fig. 3, we compare data from RHIC with the nuclear modification factor calculated\nfor different values of the transport coefficient q\u0302. This figure is for a medium which\nexists for at most \u03c4 \u223c Lcut = 5 fm in the dense partonic phase. We find that even in the\nabsence of final state parton energy loss, q\u0302 = 0, the nuclear modification factor shows\na reduction from the baseline RAA \u2261 1 for pT >\n\u223c 13 GeV. The reason is that in this pT\nsampled by the hadronic\nregion, the incoming parton momentum fractions x \u2243 2pT\u221a/hzi\ns\nspectrum lie in the so-called EMC region where nuclear parton distribution functions\ndecrease faster than free proton parton distribution functions with increasing x [20].\nThis decrease of the incoming parton flux translates into a pT -dependent decrease of\nthe nuclear modification factor RAA . As the density of the medium (or equivalently the\n7\n\n\ftransport coefficient) is increased, the nuclear modification factor is reduced further.\nThis is caused by parton energy loss in the final state. Interestingly, the resulting\nnuclear modification factor RAA is almost pT -independent and its dependence on q\u0302\nbecomes weaker as q\u0302 increases.

Different\nlines are for a maximal lifetime of the medium \u03c4 \u223c Lcut =5 fm and different values of the\ntransport coefficient q\u0302. The shaded region between the curves calculated with reweighted\n(solid curves) and non-reweighted (dotted-dashed curves) quenching weights is indicative of\nuncertainties related to finite energy corrections. For comparison, the most central RAA data\nfrom the RHIC collaborations are shown (with statistical errors only): 0 \u2212 5% STAR data\nfor |\u03b7| < 0.5 [4], 0 \u2212 10% PHENIX data for |\u03b7| < 0.35 [2], 0 \u2212 10% BRAHMS data for \u03b7 = 0\n[6] and 0 \u2212 6% PHOBOS data for 0.2 < \u03b7 < 1.4 [5].\n\nTo understand the approximate pT -independence of RAA , we study the sensitivity\nof RAA to the pT -dependent shape of the partonic cross section entering (2). (For\nqualitative results we assume z \u223c 1, which is a fairly good approximation for quark\ndominated hadron production at RHIC in the large-pT region of our interest.) We\nconsider first a partonic cross section which has a powerlaw tail d\u03c3/dpT \u223c 1/pnT , n\nconstant. If n is sufficiently large, then the medium-modified\nspectrum can be obtained\np\nby shifting the vacuum spectrum by S(pT ) \u223c pT /n [23], and one finds RAA (pT ) \u223c\np\n\u0001\u2212n\n\u221a\n1 + c/ npT\nwhere c = 2\u03c0\u03b1s2 \u03c9c . In this case, RAA approaches unity in the limit\n8\n\n\fof large pT , except for possible modifications in the incoming parton distributions. In\ncontrast, if the partonic spectrum is exponential, one finds a pT -independent nuclear\nmodification factor\nZ\nZ\nexp{\u2212a(pT + \u2206E)}\n= d(\u2206E)P (\u2206E) exp{\u2212a\u2206E} .\nRAA (pT ) \u223c d(\u2206E)P (\u2206E)\nexp{\u2212apT }\n(21)\nFor the spectra of produced quarks and gluons computed from Eq. (15) at RHIC energies, one finds that the logarithmic slope n of the partonic pT -spectrum increases with\nincreasing pT . This makes parton energy loss more effective in reducing RAA at high\npT . Moreover, due to kinematic boundary effects, the underlying partonic spectrum at\nRHIC can be parametrized by an exponential exp{\u2212apT } for pT & 30 GeV. As a consequence of (21), one thus finds - in agreement with Fig. 3 - an almost pT -independent\nRAA at large pT & 30 GeV. [Although this is not within experimental reach, we note\nthat close to the kinematical limit pT \u223c 100 GeV, the slope decreases even faster.] The\nremaining weak pT -dependence can be attributed to the parton species dependence of\nthe quenching weights and to the nuclear dependences of the incoming parton distribution function which turn out to further reduce RAA with increasing pT . In conclusion,\nthe onset of a perturbative pT powerlaw (at pT > 5 GeV say), and its return to an\nexponential spectrum at pT & 30 GeV leave a finite window at RHIC energies. Within\nthis window, the gradually increasing slope of the partonic spectrum implies an almost\npT -independent nuclear modification factor.\n\n1.0\n\nRAA at pT=10 GeV\n\n0.9\n+\n\nsNN = 200 GeV, (h +h )/2\nAeff = 181 (0-5%)\nLcut = 5.0 fm\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\nrw\nnon-rw\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nq^\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n2\n\n[GeV /fm]\n\nFigure 4: (Colour online) RAA for charged hadrons h \u2261 (h+ + h\u2212 )/2 in the 0 \u2212 5% most\ncentral Au+Au collisions at\n\n\u221a\n\nsN N = 200 GeV as a function of q\u0302 for pT =10 GeV.\n\n9\n\n\fWe now turn to the dependence of RAA on q\u0302. Partons which traverse a larger inmedium pathlength tend to lose more energy. As a consequence, the dominant fraction\nof leading partons comes from the outer skin of the two-dimensional transverse overlap\nof the colliding nuclei. We refer to the outer region of the medium as \"skin\" rather than\n\"surface\" since it has a finite three-volume. In Appendix A, we give further support\nfor this dominance of skin-emission for realistic densities at RHIC and at the LHC.\nThe dominance of skin-emission appears to limit the sensitivity of RAA on the density\nof the medium. Indeed, we find that for sufficiently large but realistic densities of the\nmedium, the thickness of the outer skin changes only weakly with increasing density,\nsee Fig. 4. Thus the nuclear modification factor is a sensitive measure of the density\n2\nof the medium up to q\u0302 <\n\u223c 4 GeV /fm, but it loses this sensitivity for higher values of q\u0302.\nFrom Fig. 3 and 4 we conclude that the suppression of high-pT hadrons measured\n\u221a\nin sNN = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC requires a time-averaged transport\ncoefficient q\u0302 > 5 GeV2 /fm and favours q\u0302 = 5 \u2212 15 GeV2 /fm.\n\n4\n\nExtrapolation to the LHC\n\nWithin the formalism of section 2, the choice of the transport coefficient q\u0302 is the main\nunknown for extrapolating our results from RHIC to Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC\n\u221a\nenergy sN N = 5500 GeV. One expects that this transport coefficient grows linearly\nwith the number density, ni , of the medium [22, 25], and hence is proportional to the\nmultiplicity per unit rapidity\ndN ch\nq\u0302 \u221d\n.\n(22)\ndy\nFor the LHC, model predictions of the event multiplicity vary by a factor \u223c 4 at\nleast [34], but the corresponding uncertainty for RAA may be significantly smaller\nsince RAA changes only weakly for large values of q\u0302. The second unknown in the\ncalculation of RAA is the maximal lifetime of the dense medium, denoted by Lcut .\nWe expect, however, that this choice is numerically unimportant since Lcut at LHC is\ntypically larger than the thickness of the effective skin of the medium through which\nhard partons can penetrate without significant energy loss.\nTo be specific, we use for the LHC Lcut = \u03c4QGP \u223c 10 fm consistent with hydrodynamical modeling of the time evolution of the medium [35]. We find from an optical\nGlauber calculation that the 0 \u2212 5% most central Pb+Pb events correspond to the\nhead-on collision of nuclei with Aeff = 193. The density\nestimate is obtained from the\n\u221a 0.574\n0.383\nEKRT parametrization [36] for which ni \u223c A\n( s)\n, consistent with the growth\nof the event multiplicity measured so far. With this input, the transport coefficients\nat RHIC and the LHC are related like q\u0302LHC = 6.8q\u0302RHIC . For a typical RHIC value,\nq\u0302RHIC = 10 GeV2 /fm, we find that q\u0302LHC = 68 GeV2 /fm which is one of the parameters\nused in Fig. 5. In models which predict a smaller multiplicity increase from RHIC to\n10\n\n\fLHC [34], the suppression is expected to lie in between the bands shown in Fig. 5 for\nq\u0302RHIC = 10 GeV2 /fm and q\u0302LHC = 68 GeV2 /fm.\n\n1.2\n1.1\n\n2\n\nq^ [GeV /fm]=\n\n1.0\n\n0, no medium\n\n0.9\n1, rw\n1\n\n0.8\n\nRAA\n\n0.7\n\n+\n\nsNN = 5500 GeV, (h +h )/2\nAeff = 193 (0-5%)\nLcut = 10.0 fm\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n10, rw\n10\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n68, rw\n68\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\npT [GeV]\nFigure 5: (Colour online) The nuclear modification factor for charged hadrons h \u2261 (h+ +\n\nh\u2212 )/2 in 0 \u2212 5% most central Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, calculated for Lcut =10 fm and\nvarious values of the transport coefficient. The largest value q\u0302LHC = 68 GeV2 /fm lies in the\nrange favoured by current multiplicity estimates. See the text for more details.\n\nBased on estimates of the luminosity in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and the\nhadronic cross section, one expects that the nuclear modification factor will be measured up to pT \u223c 100 \u2212 150 GeV. Not only in this pT -range but even above, the nuclear\nmodification factor turns out to be almost pT -independent for q\u0302LHC = 68 GeV2 /fm.\nMoreover, it is numerically comparable to RAA at RHIC, calculated for a much smaller\ntransport coefficient. This can be understood as follows: the contribution from the\ndiscrete part of the quenching weight to RAA decreases with the increasing transport\ncoefficient from RHIC to the LHC (see Fig. 2 and Appendix A). At the same time,\nhowever, since the partonic transverse momentum spectra are steeper at RHIC than\nat the LHC, the suppression of RAA induced by the continuous part of the quenching\nweight (parton energy loss) is still larger at RHIC than at the LHC (see discussion in\nAppendix A). If the density of the medium created at the LHC is significantly reduced\n(q\u0302LHC = 10 GeV2 /fm), then one finds a weak but experimentally accessible increase\nof RAA (pT ) with pT . The reason is that for sufficiently low density, the probability\nthat partons from deeper layers inside the medium escape with small energy loss grows\n11\n\n\fsignificantly with increasing pT . This effect is even more pronounced for very small\ndensities of order q\u0302LHC = 1 GeV2 /fm.\nFrom this exercise, we expect that up to the highest transverse momenta accessible\nat the LHC, leading hadron spectra will show a strong suppression in nuclear collisions.\nThis suppression is likely to result in an almost pT -independent nuclear modification\nfactor. For the reasons given above and since particle emission from the outer skin\nof the medium remains essentially unsuppressed even for extreme densities, we expect\nthat the numerical value for RAA at the LHC is comparable to the one at RHIC.\n\n5\n\nThe nuclear modification factor at\nGeV\n\n\u221a\nsNN = 62.4\n\nExperiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC have just completed data\n\u221a\ntaking for Au+Au collisions at an intermediate center of mass energy of sNN = 62.4\nGeV. In Fig. 6, we give results for the corresponding nuclear modification factor in\nthe present formalism. The main model input is again the value of the time-averaged\ntransport coefficient q\u0302 defined in (5). Based on the multiplicity scaling of the transport coefficient in (22) and the value q\u0302 \u223c 5 \u2212 10 GeV2 /fm favoured for RHIC data at\n\u221a\n\u221a\nsNN = 200 GeV, we chose q\u0302 \u223c 3 \u2212 5 GeV2 /fm at sNN = 62.4 GeV. For the second\nmodel-dependent input, the life-time Lcut of the medium, we chose a slightly reduced\nvalue Lcut = 4 fm. However the dependence of our results on Lcut turns out to be negligible for sufficiently large Lcut . For medium densities favoured by multiplicity scaling\nthe suppression is pronounced. The results shown in Fig. 6 are, within theoretical uncertainties, consistent with the results published in several recent studies [37, 38, 39].\nSome caveats should be kept in mind. First, at intermediate pT < 5 \u2212 7 GeV, other\nphysical mechanisms can provide sizeable contributions to RAA . In particular, the\nanomalous baryon enhancement at intermediate pT [40, 41] and the Cronin effect [42]\nare observed to increase RAA . Both contributions may be more pronounced on a\n\u221a\nspectrum with steeper slope, i.e. for smaller sNN . Second, the smaller the hadronic\npT , the larger the theoretical uncertainty in calculating parton energy loss. Moreover,\n\u221a\nbelow pT \u223c 4 GeV, the hadron spectra at sNN = 62.4 GeV deviate significantly from\nthe shape calculated by the collinear factorized pQCD formalism [19].\nWhile completing this work, the first experimental data on the nuclear modification\n\u221a\nfactor in Au+Au collisions at sNN = 62.4 GeV appeared [43]. These data are for\n0.2 < \u03b7 < 1.4 and pT \u2264 4 GeV with RAA (pT \u223c 4GeV) \u223c 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 for the 0 \u2212 6% most\ncentral bin. Other preliminary data [44] indicate a significant further drop of RAA for\n4 < pT < 6.5 GeV.

See the text for details.\n\nRelating the Transport Coefficient to Energy Density\n\nIn section 3, we have shown that RHIC data favour a time-averaged transport coefficient\nq\u0302 \u2243 10 GeV2 /fm. This parameter as well as the time-dependent transport coefficient\nentering eq. (5) scales with the energy density of the medium like [22]\nq\u0302\u03c4 (\u03c4 ) = c \u01eb3/4 (\u03c4 ) .\n\n(23)\n\nHere, c is a proportionality constant which can be calculated for specific models of the\nmedium. In particular, for the model of an ideal quark gluon plasma whose constituents\ninteract perturbatively with the hard parton, we extract this proportionality constant\nfrom Figure 3 of Ref. [22]\ncideal\n(24)\nQGP \u2248 2 .\nAlternatively, one can determine the constant c from experiment if one has independent\ninformation about transport coefficient and energy density. From the measured timeaveraged transport coefficient q\u0302, we find via the dynamical scaling law (5) the transport\ncoefficient for an initial time \u03c40 ,\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b1\n2\u2212\u03b1 L\nq\u0302\u03c4 (\u03c40 ) = q\u0302\n.\n(25)\n2\n\u03c40\n13\n\n\fThis expression is for an expanding medium with q\u0302\u03c4 (\u03c4 ) = q\u0302\u03c4 (\u03c40 ) (\u03c40 /L)\u03b1 . We have\nassumed \u03c40 \u226a L. The expansion parameter \u03b1 is unity for a one-dimensional Bjorken\nexpansion and is expected to stay close to unity for realistic expansion scenarios. From\nthis we find\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b1\nq\u0302\u03c4 (\u03c40 )\nq\u0302\n2\u2212\u03b1 L\nc =\n=\n(26)\n\u01eb(\u03c40 )3/4\n\u01eb(\u03c40 )3/4 2\n\u03c40\nFor a typical initial time \u03c40 \u223c 0.2 fm/c, the average in-medium pathlength can be\nexpected to be \u223c 10 \u03c40 = 2 fm (see Appendix A). The energy density averaged over a\n), as\nuniform transverse profile at initial time \u03c40 can be as large as \u01eb(\u03c40 ) \u223c O(100 GeV\nfm3\nsuggested by the pQCD+saturation+hydrodynamics model [36] which correctly predicted the final multiplicities and transverse energies in central collisions at RHIC\n[30].

We note that q\u0302 is the product\nof the density of scattering centers times their elastic scattering cross section [22]. Thus,\nthe factor \u223c 4 \u2212 5 discrepancy observed here is reminiscent of the opacity problem in\nelliptic flow, where also scattering cross sections much larger than the perturbative\nones are favoured by the data [45].\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have studied within the LO pQCD formalism [19] the effect of mediuminduced parton energy loss on charged hadron spectra. At high pT we find generically\nan almost pT -independent nuclear modification factor at both LHC and RHIC energies.\nThis is a direct consequence of the interplay of medium-induced energy loss and of a\npartonic pT -spectrum whose slope increases with increasing pT . In this approach, an\nalmost pT -independent RAA is obtained without fine-tuning of nuclear effects (such as\nCronin or anomalous baryon enhancement).\n\u221a\nFor central Au+Au collisions at sN N = 200 GeV, we find a satisfactory agreement\nwith experiment for a transport coefficient in the range q\u0302 \u223c 5 \u2212 15 GeV2 /fm. For\nthese large values of q\u0302, the nuclear modification factor is only weakly dependent on\nthe transport coefficient, which makes it difficult to constrain the energy density with\nRAuAu , see Fig. 4. On the other hand, this weakened sensitivity of RAA makes our\nprediction for the nuclear suppression at the LHC more stable. Irrespective of the\nuncertainty in the factor by which the density of the medium increases from RHIC to\nthe LHC, the nuclear modification factor is expected to lie in a narrow band RPbPb \u223c\n14\n\n\f0.2\u00b10.1. This and the almost pT -independent slope of RPbPb are the main predictions of\nthe present work for Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Thus, our calculations indicate that\neven in a kinematic regime pT \u223c 100 GeV where the same energy loss formalism results\nin jet cross sections which are almost unaffected by the medium [28], the suppression\nof leading hadron spectra is still sizeable. This points to the importance of resolving\nthe internal structure of jets, i.e. the jet shape and jet multiplicity distributions, at\nthe LHC in order to access the medium-dependence.\nIn section 6, we have inverted the standard logic of the analysis of nuclear modification factors. Rather than to determine the energy density \u01eb from the measured\ntransport coefficient, we extract the proportionality factor c = q\u0302 \u01eb\u22123/4 for realistic upper limit estimates of the energy density. This proportionality factor characterizes the\nstrength of the interaction between the hard (test) parton and the medium. It turns\nout to be at least a factor \u2248 4 \u2212 5 larger than expected from perturbative estimates\n[see discussion of eq. (24)]. Although this perturbative estimate (24) is itself subject\nto significant uncertainties, we do not expect that this is the only source of such a large\ndiscrepancy. Here, we note that our finding is reminiscent of parton cascade studies of\nelliptic flow [45] where perturbative partonic cross sections have to be scaled by large\nfactors in order to match the size of the collective evolution. Both effects may have\na common origin since both concern the interaction strength of partonic degrees of\nfreedom with the medium produced in the collision.\nNote added: While completing this work, a calculation of nuclear modification\nfactors in a closely related model appeared [46]. This study supports the approximate\npT -independence of the nuclear modification factor at RHIC and at the LHC. Moreover,\nthis model calculation reproduces the observed centrality dependence of RAA and of\nthe suppression of the away-side jet-like correlations. That the centrality dependence\nof suppressed high-pT hadroproduction follows naturally, once the suppression for the\nmost central bin is fixed, was also found in Ref. [47].\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank N. Armesto, R. Baier, A. Dainese and P.V. Ruuskanen for helpful discussions.\nFinancial support from the Academy of Finland, the projects 50338 and 206024, is\ngratefully acknowledged.\n\nA\n\nFurther studies of the dependences of RAA\n\nWe have argued in section 3 that for the densities attained at RHIC, leading hadroproduction is limited to the outer skin of the collision region. Here, we further support\nthis argument by calculating the dependence of RAA on Lcut . In particular, Fig. 7\nestablishes that a reduction of the maximum in-medium pathlength from 6 fm to 4 fm\n\n15\n\n\fleaves the nuclear modification factor almost unaffected. The slight sensitivity of RAA\nto Lcut =3 fm indicates that a small contribution comes from partons which traverse\n3 \u2212 4 fm of matter with transport coefficient q\u0302 = 10 GeV2 /fm. Thus, essentially all\npartons with L > 3 fm, as well as a fraction of the partons with L < 3 fm do not\ncontribute to the leading hadron spectrum. The average geometrical path length is\n8\nlarger than L = 3 fm, it is hLgeom i = 3\u03c0\nRA = 5.2 fm for a cylindrical uniform nucleus\n(we use Aeff = 181 and RAeff = 6.2). Thus, much less than half of the partons will\nsucceed in escaping the medium with sufficient energy, in agreement with the observed\nvalue for RAuAu at RHIC.\n\n1.0\n\u2605\nSTAR (0-5%)\n\u2605\n\n0.9\n\nPHENIX (0-10%)\nBRAHMS (0-10%)\nPHOBOS (0-6%)\n\n0.8\n0.7\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n+\n\n. .\n\nsNN = 200 GeV, (h +h )/2\nAeff = 181 (0-5%)\n2\nq^ = 10 GeV /fm\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.6\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRAA\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.5\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.4\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.3\n\nLcut [fm] =\n3.0, rw\n4.0, rw\n5.0, rw\n6.0, rw\n\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n.\n\n0.2\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.1\n0.0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\npT [GeV]\nFigure 7: (Colour online) The nuclear modification factor RAA for charged hadrons h \u2261 (h+ +\n\n\u221a\nh\u2212 )/2 in the 0 \u2212 5% most central Au+Au collisions at sN N = 200 GeV. The solid curves\n(dotted-dashed curves) are the reweighted (non-reweighted) results with q\u0302 = 10 GeV2 /fm\nand Lcut =3, 4, 5 and 6 fm. The data are the same as in Fig. 3.\n\nAnother illustration of skin-dominated leading hadroproduction in nucleus-nucleus\ncollision is to compare RAA calculated for several fixed in-medium pathlengths L = 1...6\nfm, see Fig. 8. For a small transport coefficient, q\u0302 = 1 GeV2 /fm, RAA decreases\nsignificantly even for L=4, 5, 6 fm, indicating that leading hadrons can originate from\npartons with significant in-medium pathlength. Fig. 8 is consistent with the statement\nin [21] that the suppression of hadrons at RHIC can be accounted for by q\u0302 = 1 GeV2 /fm\nand L \u223c 6 fm. In the present study, we find a significantly larger transport coefficient\nsince the relevant in-medium pathlength turns out to be much smaller. Consistent with\n16\n\n\fRAA\n\nthe statement made above, if the transport coefficient is increased to q\u0302 = 10 GeV2 /fm,\npartons with in-medium pathlength more than 3 fm make a negligible contribution to\nthe nuclear modification factor, see Fig. 8. This is consistent with the model discussed\nin Ref. [48]. Effectively, with q\u0302 = 10 GeV2 /fm the results from RHIC can be reproduced\nwith a fixed path length L \u223c 2 fm, which is clearly smaller than hLgeom i = 5.2 fm (see\nalso [29]). For L \u221a\n\u223c 2 fm, the average momentum transfer acquired by the hard partons\nis of the order q\u0302L \u223c 4.5 GeV. Thus, the direction of partons with qTi <\n\u223c 5 GeV\nis randomized; they become part of the medium. This suggests that hadrons with\npT <\n\u223c 2 \u2212 3 GeV, which form the bulk of the multiplicity, originate from decoupling of\nthe strongly interacting system. This observation is consistent with the results in [49].\n1.2\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\n1.2\n1.1\nq^ = 1 GeV /fm\nq^ = 10 GeV /fm\n1.0\n\u2605 STAR (0-5%)\nPHENIX (0-10%)\n0.9\nBRAHMS (0-10%)\n0.8\nL=1 fm\nPHOBOS (0-6%)\n\u2605\n\u2605\n0.7\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n0.6\nL=1\nfm\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n0.5\n\u2605 \u2605\n+\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\nsNN = 200 GeV, (h +h )/2\n0.4\n\u2605 \u2605\n\u2605\nAeff = 181 (0-5%)\n\u2605\n\u2605\n0.3\n\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\nL=2 fm\n\u2605\n0.2\n\u2605\n\u2605\nL=6 fm\n0.1\n0.0\n25 30 35 40 45 0\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2605\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\n.\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\n\u2605\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n. .\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\u2605\n.\n\n\u2605\n.\n\n.\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\u2605\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\u2605 \u2605\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\n\u2605\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\u2605\n\n.\n\n5\n\n\u2605\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n. .\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n10\n\n.\n\n15\n\n20\n\npT [GeV]\n\n\u2605\n.\n\npT [GeV]\n\nFigure 8: (Colour online) The non-reweighted RAA results at RHIC computed using constant\nin-medium path length L for q\u0302 = 1 GeV2 /fm (left panel) and q\u0302 = 10 GeV2 /fm (right panel).\nSee the text for further details. The data are the same as in Fig. 3.\n\nWe finally check to what extent the effects of parton energy loss on RAA are due to\nthe discrete or the continuous part of the quenching weight (6). The discrete part p0\ndepends for fixed L and q\u0302 only on the parton species, see Fig. 2. The non-reweighted\ncontribution of p0 to RAA therefore interpolates between the values pgluon\nand pquark\n0\n0\nas a function of pT . In Fig. 9 we fix L = 3 fm, and show separately the discrete and\ncontinuous contribution to the nuclear modification factor RAA at RHIC for q\u0302 = 1\nand 10 GeV2 /fm. No other nuclear effects are included in Fig. 9. The high-pT hadron\nspectrum at RHIC is dominated by quark production, and thus the non-reweighted\ndiscrete component of RAA is very close to pquark\n.\n0\nAt the LHC, for q\u0302 = 1 and 10 GeV2 /fm, the suppression is weaker than at RHIC,\nsee Fig. 10 and Sec. 4. The contribution of the discrete part to RAA is smaller than at\nRHIC since a significant part of the hadron production is now of gluonic origin. [The\nslight decrease of the discrete contribution at pT >\n\u223c 200 GeV reflects the relative shape\n17\n\n\f1.0\n\n1.0\n2\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\ndisc+cont, rw\ndisc+cont\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n. .\n\n.\n\nRAA\n\n0.5\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\ndisc, rw\ndisc\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\ndisc+cont, rw\ndisc, rw\ncont, rw\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\ndisc+cont\ndisc\ncont\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\n.\n\n0.2\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.1\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n.\n\ncont, rw\ncont\n\n.\n\n0.6\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.7\n\n+\n\nsNN = 200 GeV, (h +h )/2\nAeff = 181 (0-5%)\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.3\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n. .\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.4\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPHENIX (0-10%)\nBRAHMS (0-10%)\nPHOBOS (0-6%)\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n.\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\nSTAR (0-5%)\n\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\u2605 \u2605\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nq^ = 10 GeV /fm, L = 3 fm, no nuclear effects\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\nq^ = 1 GeV /fm, L = 3 fm, no nuclear effects\n\n0.1\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n0\n\npT [GeV]\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n0.0\n50\n\npT [GeV]\n\nFigure 9: (Colour online) The relative contributions of the discrete and continuous parts of\nthe quenching weight (6) to the nuclear modification factor RAA at RHIC for fixed in-medium\npath length L = 3 fm and for q\u0302 = 1 GeV2 /fm (left panel) and q\u0302 = 10 GeV2 /fm (right panel),\nrespectively.
