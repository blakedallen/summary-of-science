In addition to this, they are clean\ntheoretically because they are free from the nonperturbative effects. The experimental work\ndone stimulate the theoretical studies on LFV decays. The \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 processes are\n\namong the LFV decays and the experimental the current limits for their branching ratios (BR)\nhave been predicted as 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 [1] and 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 [2], respectively.\n\nIn the framework of the standard model (SM) the theoretical values of the BRs of LFV\n\ninteractions are extremely small. Therefore, one search new models beyond the SM to enhance\nthese numerical values and the two Higgs doublet model (2HDM), with flavor changing neural\ncurrents (FCNC) at tree level, is one of the candidate. In this model, the LFV interactions are\ninduced by the internal neutral Higgs bosons h0 and A0 with the help of the Yukawa couplings,\nappearing as free parameters, which can be determined by the experimental data.\nThe present work is devoted to the analysis of \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi , i = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 decay in the 2HDM\n\nwith the inclusion of a single extra dimension, respecting the Randall Sundrum model (see [3]\nand [4] for the calculation of the BR of the same decay in the 2HDM without and with flat\nextra dimensions). Here, the LFV transition \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc is driven by the internal scalar bosons h0\nand A0 and the internal Z boson connects this transition to the \u03bd\u0304\u03bd output (see Fig. 1)1 .\n\nThe hierarchy problem between weak and Planck scales could be explained by introducing\nthe extra dimensions. The model introduced by Randall and Sundrum [5, 6] (the RS1 model)\nis related to the non-factorizable geometry where the gravity is localized in a 4D brane, so\ncalled Planck (hidden) brane, which is away from another 4D brane, which is the visible (TeV)\nbrane where we live. In this scenario, the hierarchy is generated by the warped factor, which\nis an exponential function of the compactified radius in the extra dimension. There are other\nscenarios based on the RS1 background in the literature [7]-[16]. In [8, 9] the behavior of U(1)\ngauge boson, accessible to the extra dimension in the RS1 background, has been studied and it\nwas observed that the massless mode was not localized in the extra dimension. Furthermore,\nit was obtained that the KK excitations have large couplings to boundaries and this was not\na phenomenologically favorable scenario since, for a perturbative theory, it would have been\nnecessary to push the visible scale to energies greater than TeV. To have a zero mode localized\n1\n\nHere, we respect the assumption that the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) type matrix in the leptonic\nsector doest not exist and the charged flavor changing (FC) interactions vanish.\n\n1\n\n\fin the bulk and to get small couplings of KK modes with the boundaries, the idea of brane\nlocalized mass terms has been considered for scalar fields [10]. These terms could change the\nboundary conditions to get a zero mode localized solution. In [10, 11], the bulk fermions were\nconsidered in the RS1 background. [12] was devoted to a extensive work on the bulk fields in\nvarious multi-brane models. In [16], the U(1) gauge field with bulk and boundary mass terms\nwere taken into account and only the U(1)Y gauge field was considered as localized in the bulk.\nIn this work, we study the effects of localization of the U(1)Y gauge boson around the\nvisible brane and analyze the contributions of the KK modes of Z bosons on the BRs of the\nLFV \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi decay, by following the idea that the U(1)Y gauge field is accessible to the extra\n\ndimension in the RS1 background and the other particles, including the new Higgs doublet lie\non the visible brane.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the theoretical expression for\n\nthe decay width of the LFV decay \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi , i = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 , in the framework of the 2HDM by\n\nconsidering the non zero localization of the U(1)Y gauge in the RS1 background. Section 3 is\n\ndevoted to discussion and our conclusions. In Appendix A, we present the model construction.\nAppendix B is devoted to the explicit expressions of the functions appearing in the general\neffective vertex for the interaction of off-shell Z-boson with a fermionic current.\n\n2\n\nThe effect of the localized U (1)Y gauge boson on the\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi decay in the Randall Sundrum background\n\nLFV \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi decay exists at least in the one loop level and, therefore, the physical quantities,\n\nlike the BR, contain rich information about the model used and the free parameters existing. In\nthe version of the 2HDM with the FCNCs at tree level, the LFV interactions exist with larger\nBRs, compared to ones obtained in the extended SM with massive neutrinos. These decays are\ndriven by the Yukawa interaction lagrangian and the strength of the interaction is controlled by\nthe new Yukawa couplings. The additional effects coming from the possible extra dimension(s)\nbring new contributions to the BRs of these decays and, in the present work, we study these\neffects by assuming that the U(1)Y gauge boson is accessible to the extra dimension and is\nlocalized on the visible brane, in the RS1 background.\nThe RS1 model is a higher dimensional scenario that is based on a non-factorizable geometry\nand the hierarchy is generated by the warped factor, which is an exponential function of the\ncompactified radius in the extra dimension. This model is based on the idea that the gravity is\nlocalized on the so called hidden brane, which is one of the boundary of the S 1 /Z2 orbifold extra\n2\n\n\fdimension, and extended into the bulk with varying strength, however, the SM fields live in\nanother brane, the so called visible brane, which is the other boundary of the extra dimension.\nIn this scenario, the 5D cosmological constant is non vanishing and both branes have equal and\nopposite tensions so that the low energy effective theory has flat 4D spacetime. The metric of\nsuch 5D world reads\nds2 = e\u22122 k y \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dy 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k is the bulk curvature constant, R is the compactification radius, y = R |\u03b8|, 0 \u2264 |\u03b8| \u2264 \u03c0\n\nand e\u2212k R |\u03b8| is the warp factor which causes that all the mass terms are rescaled on the visible\nbrane for \u03b8 = \u03c0. With the rough estimate, kR \u223c 11 \u2212 12, all mass terms are bring down to the\nTeV scale.\n\nThe LFV \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi decay is induced by \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcZ \u2217 transition and Z \u2217 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi process (see\n\nFig. 1). The \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcZ \u2217 transition, which needs the FCNC at tree level, is driven by the internal\n\nnew neutral Higgs bosons h0 and A0 , which are living on the visible brane. Now, we present\nthe Yukawa interaction, which is responsible for the \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc transition of the decay,\n\nSY =\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd x \u2212g \u03be E  \u0304liL \u03c62 EjR + h.c. \u03b4(y \u2212 \u03c0R) ,\n!\n\n5\n\n(2)\n\nwhere L and R denote chiral projections L(R) = 1/2(1 \u2213 \u03b35 ), \u03c62 is the new scalar doublet, liL\n\n(EjR ) are lepton doublets (singlets), \u03beijE 2 , with family indices i, j , are the Yukawa couplings\nwhich induce the FV interactions in the lepton sector and g is the determinant of the metric3\n(see eq. (1)). We assume that the Higgs doublet \u03c61 has non-zero vacuum expectation value to\nensure the ordinary masses of the gauge fields and the fermions, however, the second doublet\nhas no vacuum expectation value, namely, we choose the doublets \u03c61 and \u03c62 and their vacuum\nexpectation values as\n1\n\u03c61 = \u221a\n2\n\n\"\n\n0\nv + H0\n\n!\n\n+\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03c7+\ni\u03c70\n\n!#\n\n1\n; \u03c62 = \u221a\n2\n\n\u221a\n\n2H +\nH1 + iH2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nand\n1\n< \u03c61 >= \u221a\n2\n\n0\nv\n\n!\n\n; < \u03c62 >= 0 .\n\n(4)\n\nE\nIn the following, we replace \u03be E with \u03beN\nwhere \"N\" denotes the word \"neutral\".\n\u221a\n\u22124 k y\nNotice that the term \u2212g = e\nis embedded into the redefinitions of the fields on the visible brane for\ny = \u03c0 R, namely, they are warped as \u03c62 \u2192 ek \u03c0 R \u03c6warp\n, li \u2192 e3 k \u03c0 R/2 liwarp and in the following we use warped\n2\nfields without the warp index.\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n\fThis choice ensures that the mixing between neutral scalar Higgs bosons is switched off and it\nwould be possible to separate the particle spectrum so that the SM particles are collected in\nthe first doublet and the new particles in the second one4 .\nIn our analysis, we further assume that the U(1)Y gauge boson is accessible to the extra\ndimension and the other particles,including SU(2)L gauge bosons are confined on the visible\nbrane. This leads to an effective localization of Z boson in the bulk of RS1 background.\nTherefore, the physical quantities related to the decay studied get additional contributions\ncoming from the internal Z boson and its KK modes (see [16] for details and Appendix A for\nthe summary of the model construction).\nNow, we present the general effective vertex for the interaction of off-shell Z-boson with a\nfermionic current\n\u0393\u03bc(REN ) (\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcZ \u2217 ) = f1 \u03b3\u03bc + f2 \u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 + f3 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bd + f4 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03b35 k \u03bd ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere k is the momentum transfer, k 2 = (p \u2212 p\u2032 )2 , p (p\u2032 ) is the four momentum vector of\nincoming (outgoing) lepton and the explicit expressions for the functions f1 , f2 , f3 and f4\n\nare given in Appendix B. The matrix element M of the \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi process is obtained by\n\nconnecting the \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc transition to the \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi pair with the internal Z boson and its KK modes\n\n(see Fig. 1).

The Yukawa couplings \u03be \u0304N,ij\n, i, j = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 are the essential\n4\n\nHere H 1 (H 2 ) is the well known mass eigenstate h0 (A0 ).\n\n4\n\n\fparameters driving the lepton flavor violation and they are free parameters which should be\nfixed by present and forthcoming experiments.5 In our calculations, we assume that the Yukawa\ncouplings \u03be \u0304E are symmetric with respect to the indices i and j and take \u03be \u0304E , i, j = e, \u03bc, as\nN,ij\n\nN,ij\n\nE\nsmall compared to \u03be \u0304N,\u03c4\ni i = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 since we consider that the strengths of these couplings\n\nare related with the masses of leptons denoted by the indices of them. Therefore, we take\nonly the \u03c4 lepton as an internal one and we choose the couplings \u03be \u0304E and \u03be \u0304E as non-zero.\nN,\u03c4 \u03c4\n\nN,\u03c4 \u03bc\n\nE\nThe upper limit of the coupling \u03be \u0304N,\u03c4\n\u03bc has been estimated as 30 GeV (see [17] and references\n\ntherein) by assuming that the new physics effects can not exceed experimental uncertainty 10\u22129\nin the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. In our numerical calculation\nwe choose \u03be \u0304E = 1 GeV by respecting this upper limit. Since there is no restriction for the\nN,\u03c4 \u03bc\n\nE\n \u0304E\nYukawa coupling \u03be \u0304N,\u03c4\n\u03c4 , the numerical values we use are greater than \u03beN,\u03c4 \u03bc .\n\nThe addition of a single extra spatial dimension brings new contributions to the BR of the\ndecay under consideration and the source of these contributions are the KK excitations of the\nparticles, which live in the bulk. Here, we study the BR of the LFV process \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi in\n\nthe framework of the 2HDM, including the extra dimension effects in the RS1 scenario. The\nRS1 model is an alternative scenario to solve the well known hierarchy problem. It is based\non the assumption that the extra dimension is compactified into S 1 /Z2 orbifold with two 4D\n\nsurfaces (branes) at the boundaries in 5D world and the extra dimensional bulk is populated\nby gravity, which is localized on the hidden brane. Furthermore, the SM particles live on the\nso called visible brane. However, in our case, we follow the idea [16] that the U(1)Y gauge field\nis accessible to the extra dimension in the RS1 background and the other particles, including\nthe new Higgs doublet, lie on the visible brane6 . With the help of the boundary mass term (see\neq. (12)) it is possible to get zero the mode term and this mode is localized around the visible\nbrane with the special choice of the parameters, a and \u03b1, related to the bulk and boundary\nmass terms (eq. (14)). If the parameter \u03b1 vanishes, namely, there is no boundary mass term,\nKK mode coupling to fermions becomes almost one order larger compared to the zero mode one\nand, in order to obtain a perturbative theory, it would be necessary to push the visible scale to\nenergies greater than TeV (see the discussion given in [8, 9]). This is not a phenomenologically\nfavorable scenario. For \u03b1 > 0 the zero mode is localized around the visible brane and the KK\nmode fermion coupling is small enough for \u03b1 > 1 to obey the phenomenology. Notice that one\ngets the original RS1 model for infinitely large \u03b1.\n5\n\nE\nE\nThe dimensionfull Yukawa couplings \u03be\u0304N,ij\nare defined as \u03beN,ij\n=\n\n6\n\nq\n\n4\u221a\nGF\n2\n\nE\n\u03be \u0304N,ij\n.\n\nHere we assume that the corresponding gauge field make small contribution to the bulk energy density not\nto disturb the solution of the Einstein's equations.\n\n5\n\n\fIn the present work, we study the effects of localization of the U(1)Y gauge boson and\nthe contributions of the KK modes of Z bosons on the BRs of the LFV \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi decay.\nThroughout our calculations we use the input values given in Table (1).\nParameter\nm\u03bc\nm\u03c4\nmh0\nmA0\nGF\n\nValue\n0.106 (GeV)\n1.78 (GeV)\n100 (GeV)\n200 (GeV)\n1.1663710\u22125(GeV \u22122 )\n\nTable 1: The values of the input parameters used in the numerical calculations.\nIn Fig. 2, we present the parameter a dependence of the BR of the LFV \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi decay\nE\n \u0304E\nfor \u03be \u0304N,\u03c4\n\u03c4 = 10 GeV and \u03beN,\u03c4 \u03bc = 1 GeV . The solid (dashed-small dashed-dotted) line represents\nthe BR without extra dimension (with extra dimension for kR = 12, k = 1018 GeV \u2212 kR =\n\n11, k = 1018 GeV \u2212 kR = 11, k = 1017 GeV ). This figure shows that the BR is at the order of\nthe magnitude of 10\u22126 for the free parameters used and it decreases with the increasing values\n\nof a. This is due to the fact that the interaction coupling of Z boson KK modes to the fermions\nbecomes weak with the increasing values of the zero mode localization parameter \u03b1 and the\nincrease in KK mode masses results in a suppression in the KK mode contribution. For the\nlimit a \u2192 \u221e, this coupling vanishes, the zero mode is confined in the visible brane and we\n\nreach the numerical values of BR for the original RS1 model, where all 2HDM particles are\nconfined in the visible brane. On the other hand, we observe that for decreasing values of kR\nthe BR becomes smaller because of the weaker coupling g (n) .\nE\nFig. 3 is devoted to the parameter k dependence of the BR(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi ) for \u03be \u0304N,\u03c4\n\u03c4 = 10 GeV\nE\nand \u03be \u0304N,\u03c4 \u03bc = 1 GeV and kR = 11. The solid (dashed-small dashed-dotted) line represents the\n\nBR without extra dimension (with extra dimension for a = 0.1 \u2212 0.5 \u2212 1.0). It is observed that\n\nthe BR decreases with the increasing values of k. Here the KK mode masses increases with k\n\nfor fixed kR and, as a result, the BR is suppressed and reaches to the one which is obtained\nwithout extra dimension.\nFinally, for completeness, we study the Yukawa coupling dependence of the BR for different\nvalues of the parameter a. Fig. 4 represents \u03be \u0304E dependence of the BR of the LFV \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi\nN,\u03c4 \u03c4\n\n18\nE\ndecay, for \u03be \u0304N,\u03c4\n\u03bc = 1 GeV , kR = 12 and k = 10 GeV . The solid (dashed-small dashed) line\n\nrepresents the BR without extra dimension (with extra dimension for a = 0.5 \u2212 1.0). The BR\n\nis sensitive to the Yukawa couplings as it should be and the increase in the parameter a pushes\n6\n\n\fthe numerical value of the BR to the one obtained without extra dimension because of strong\nlocalization of the Z field around the visible brane. This is case that the original RS1 model is\nreached, where the extra dimension effects are switched off for the process under consideration.\nAs a result, the BR of the LFV \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi decay is sensitive to the parameter a and\n\nit decreases with the increasing values of a. In addition to this, the BR decreases with the\n\nincreasing values of k for fixed kR, since the masses of KK modes are proportional to k. The\nsensitivity of the BR(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304i \u03bdi ) to the extra dimension effects in RS1 model is informative\n\nand the more accurate future experimental measurement of this decay can ensure a possible\n\ntest for the existence of the model used and the determination of the signals coming from the\nextra dimensions.\n\n7\n\n\fAppendix\nA\n\nModel Construction\n\nNow, we would like to summarize the model construction, following the work [16], by respecting\nthe assumption that U(1)Y gauge boson is accessible to the extra dimension and the SU(2)L\ngauge bosons and the other particles, fermions, Higgs bosons, are living on the visible brane,\nin the RS1 background.

In eq.

Here we take only the \u03c4 lepton in the internal\nE\nE\nline and we neglect all the Yukawa couplings except \u03beN,\u03c4\n\u03c4 and \u03beN,\u03c4 \u03bc in the loop contributions\nE\n(see Discussion section). The Yukawa couplings \u03beN,ji\nare complex in general, however, in the\n\npresent work, we take them real.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. L. Brooks et. al., MEGA Collaboration, Phys. Rev.
