We give some birationality criteria for \u03c6m (m = 4, 5,\n6, 7) on general type 3-folds with pg \u2265 2 by means of an intensive\nclassification. In particular, we show that \u03c67 is not birational if\nand only if pg (X) = 2 and X admits a genus 2 curve family of\ncanonical degree 23 . When the canonical volume is large, we also\ncharacterize the birationality of \u03c64 , \u03c65 and \u03c66 .\n\n1. Introduction\nWe work over any algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0 (for\ninstance, k = C).\nPluricanonical maps are usually important tools to study birational\ngeometry of projective varieties. Recently, due to the boundedness theorem independently proved by Hacon-Mc kernan, Takayama and Tsuji,\nit has raised a hope to look into explicit birational geometry of high\ndimensional varieties of general type. In dimension 3, the development\nis much favorable by virtue of [5, 6] where the following is known:\n1\n, and\n\u22c4 the volume Vol(V ) \u2265 2660\n\u22c4 the pluricanonical map \u03c6m is birational for all m \u2265 73\nwhere V is any nonsingular projective 3-fold of general type. Even\nthough, birational geometry in dimension 3 is far from being wellunderstood.\nAs far as we know 3-folds with very small volume and very bad pluricanonical behaviors all have invariants pg = q = 0 and they correspond\nto surfaces with pg = q = 0 (i.e. Godeaux surfaces, Campedelli surfaces, Burniat surfaces and so on). Threefolds with pg = 1 form a\nvery typical class of which pluricanonical behaviors are slightly better.\nThose with pg > 1 should be ragarded as general objects from the point\nof view of \"moduli\". A feasible strategy to study 3-folds of general type\nmight be to distinguish the set of 3-folds into 3 subsets and to treat\neach of them by an appropriate method, say,\nV3 = {X1 |pg (X1 ) = 0} \u222a {X2 |pg (X2 ) = 1} \u222a {X3 |pg (X3 ) \u2265 2}\n(=V3,0 )\n\n(=V3,1 )\n\n(=V3,2 )\n\nSupported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (#11171068,\n#11121101, #11231003).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. Chen\n\nwhere Xi denotes an arbitrary 3-fold of general type. Though all above\n3 parts are known up to some extent, none of them is clear enough.\nThe motivation of this article is to go further on classification.\nIn this paper we are interested in the third part V3,2 . Based on our\nprevious papers [7, 8] and Chen-Zhang [9], we would like to investigate\ncertain parallel phenomenon between surfaces and 3-folds. First of all\nlet us make the following interesting comparison of known results:\nBirationality of \u03c6m on surfaces S\n(Bombieri [3], Miyaoka [17])\n\nBirationality of \u03c6m on 3-folds X\nwith pg \u2265 2\n(Chen [7, 8], Chen-Zhang [9])\n\n\u03c65 is birational\n\n\u03c68 is birational\n\u03c67 (?)\n\n(K 2 , pg ) 6= (1, 2) \u21d0\u21d2\n\u03c64 is birational\n\npg \u2265 3 =\u21d2 \u03c66 is birational;\npg = 2 (?)\n\n(K 2 , pg ) 6= (1, 2), (2, 3) \u21d0\u21d2\n\u03c63 is birational\n\npg \u2265 4 =\u21d2 \u03c65 is birational;\npg = 2, 3 (?)\n\nwhen K 2 \u2265 10 or pg \u2265 6,\n\u03c62 is non-birational iff S admits\na family of genus 2 curves;\n\nwhen pg \u2265 5,\n\u03c64 is non-birational iff X admits\na genus 2 curve family of\ncanonical degree 1\n\nwhen K 2 \u2264 9, \u03c62 (?)\n\nwhen pg \u2264 4, \u03c64 (?)\n\n\u03c61 (?)\n\n\u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c63 (?)\n\nwhere \"?\" means an open status, \u03c6n := \u03a6|mKS | and \u03c6m := \u03a6|mKX | .\nWe start with a translation of Bombieri's famous theorem ([3]) from\nanother point of view.\nTheorem 0. Let S be a minimal projective surface of general type.\nThen \u03c64 is non-birational if and only if S admits a genus 2 curve\nfamily C of canonical degree 1.\nProof. For a general curve C \u2208 C with (KS * C) = 1, we must have\nC 2 > 0 since it is an odd number and C is moving. Then we get\nKS2 = 1 by the Hodge index theorem. The Noether inequality implies\npg (S) = 0, 1, 2. The case pg (S) = 0 is impossible since (KS * C) \u2265 2\nby Miyaoka [17, Lemma 5]. The case pg (S) = 1 is impossible either\nsince, otherwise, KS \u2261 C which contradicts to the fact that S is simply\nconnected (see Bombieri [3]). Thus S is a (1, 2) surface and \u03c64 is nonbirational according to Bombieri [3].\nConversely, since \u03c64 is non-birational, S is a (1,2) surface by Bombieri\n[3] and the canonical curve family on S is the desired family of canonical\ndegree 1.\n\u0003\n\n\fSome birationality criteria on 3-folds\n\n3\n\nThe aim of this paper is to study those open cases on 3-folds. Here\nis one of the main results:\nTheorem 1.1. Let X be a minimal projective 3-fold of general type\nand pg (X) \u2265 2. Then\n(1) \u03c67 is birational if and only if either pg (X) > 2 or X does not\nadmit any genus 2 curve family C of canonical degree 23 . (see\nDefinition 2.5 for exact meaning of a \"curve family\")\n3\n(2) \u03c66 is birational unless pg = 2 and KX\n\u2264 6.\n(3) \u03c65 is birational unless X has one of the following numerical\ntypes:\n3\n3.1. pg (X) = 3 and KX\n\u2264 6;\n3\n3.2. pg (X) = 2 and KX \u2264 81.\nWe provide some supporting examples which show that all above\nexceptional cases do really occur.\nExample A. (1) The general hypersurface X := X16 \u2282 P(1, 1, 2, 3, 8)\n(see Fletcher [11, p151]) of degree 16 has the invariants pg = 2 and\n3\nKX\n= 31 . It is clear that \u03c67 is non-birational. Automatically \u03c66 , \u03c65 are\nnon-birational either since pg > 0. According to our earlier result in\n[8], X is canonically fibred by (1,2) surfaces and the relative canonical\nmap of \u03c61 of X gives a genus 2 curve family of canonical degree 23 .\n(2) The general hypersurface X := X14 \u2282 P(1, 1, 2, 2, 7) of degree 14\n3\nhas the invariants pg = 2 and KX\n= 21 and there are 7 orbifold points\n1\n(1, \u22121, 1) on X. Clearly \u03c67 is birational. Since the Cartier index of\n2\nX is 2, it does not admit any curve family of canonical degree 23 , which\naccounts for the birationality of \u03c67 by virtue of Theorem 1.1(1). Note\nthat \u03c66 of X is non-birational.\n(3) The general hypersurface X := X12 \u2282 P(1, 1, 1, 2, 6) of degree 12\n3\nhas the invariants pg = 3 and KX\n= 1, but \u03c65 is non-birational.\n(4) The codimension 2 complete intersection\nX := X4,12 \u2282 P(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 6)\n\n3\nof bi-degree (4, 12) has the invariants pg = 2 and KX\n= 23 , but \u03c65 is\nnon-birational.\n\nGoing on the story as in Chen-Zhang [9], we shall characterize the\nbirationality of \u03c64 as follows:\nTheorem 1.2. Let X be a minimal projective 3-fold of general type\nand X satisfies one of the following conditions:\n0. pg (X) \u2265 5. (established in [9])\n3\n1. pg (X) = 4 and KX\n> 28.\n3\n2. pg (X) = 3 and KX > 180.\n3\n3. pg (X) = 2 and KX\n> 855.\n\n\f4\n\nM. Chen\n\nThen \u03c64 is birational if and only if X does not admit any genus two\ncurve family C of canonical degree 1.\nOur classification in this paper has provided a broader way to find\nnon-trivial examples with \u03c64 non-birational. See, for instance, the\nfollowing:\nExample B. According to Theorem 5.1, any minimal 3-fold X hav3\ning terminal singularities, pg (X) = 4 and KX\n= 2 (such that \u03c61\nis generically finite) must have non-birational \u03c64 . The hypersurface\nX10 \u2282 P(1, 1, 1, 1, 5) is a very special candidate which is smooth.\n\nRemark 1. Theorem 1.2 is parallel to Theorem 0. Some other examples with non-birational \u03c64 can be found in Fletcher [11] and ChenZhang [9].\nRemark 2. The \u03c64 and \u03c63 have ever been partially studied by Zhou\n[24] and Zhu [25] under extra conditions.\nHere are some of the main observation of this paper:\n\u22c4 For a nef and big Q-divisor L on a smooth projective surface\nS with pg (S) = 1, the geometric nature of the linear system\n|KS +\u2308L\u2309| is difficult to detect, especially when (up to numerical\nequivalence) L < 2\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ). Our solution is to deform it into a\nsuccessful application of Masek's interesting theorem in [14] \u2013\na generalized form of Ein-Lazarsfeld's argument in [10].\n\u22c4 When X is fibred by surfaces with very small invariant c21 , a\n3\nlarge ratio KX\n/3c21 will be much more effective in improving\nour \"canonical restriction inequality\" in [9, Lemma 3.7], which\nwill amend whatever we didn't realize before, but one needs to\n3\nassume KX\nto be large enough.\n\u22c4 Theorem 0 and the main statements of this paper lead us to\nexpect that the existence of certain curve family with very small\ncanonical degree essentially affects the birational geometry of\nvarieties in question.\n\u22c4 Parallel to the surface case, it is impossible to handle things in\na uniform way to treat 3-folds with very small invariants (for\ninstance, with small pg and K 3 ). Sometimes the very refined\nclassification of surfaces are needed (see, for example, Claim\n5.2.4 and Remark 5.4). It is even inevitable to ask lots of new\nquestions (on surfaces with pg \u2264 1) which, unfortunately, are\nstill mysterious to experts on surfaces.\nWe are in favor of the following symbols:\n\"\u223c\" denotes linear equivalence or Q-linear equivalence;\n\"\u2261\" denotes numerical equivalence;\n\"A \u2265num B\" means that A \u2212 B is numerically equivalent to an effective\nQ-divisor.\n\n\fSome birationality criteria on 3-folds\n\n5\n\n2.

For\nany positive integer m, whenever taking the round-up of m\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ),\nwe always have \u2308m\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )\u2309 \u2264 mKX \u2032 by the definition of \u03c0 \u2217 . Since\nh0 (X \u2032 , OX \u2032 (M1 )) = h0 (\u03c9X ), we may also write \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) = M1 + E1\u2032\nwhere E1\u2032 = Z1 \u2212 E\u03c0 is an effective Q-divisor.

We say \u03a6|M | separates points P, Q \u2208 Z if\nP, Q 6\u2208 Bs|M| and \u03a6|M | (P ) 6= \u03a6|M | (Q).\nFor the convenience of readers, we recall the key technical theorem\nhere which will be frequently used throughout.\nWe define p to be 1 if d1 \u2265 2. We assume further that S is equipped\nwith a movable linear system |G| and that a generic irreducible element\nC of |G| is smooth. We define \u03be := (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )*C). We fix an integer m >\n0, and we consider a linear system on S, |Lm |, given by Lm := |KS +\n\u2308(m \u2212 1)\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) \u2212 S \u2212 1p E1\u2032 \u2309|S |. Then one has the following theorem:\nTheorem 2.2. (Chen\u2013Zhang [9, Theorem 3.6]) (1) If |Lm | separates\ndifferent generic irreducible elements of |G| (namely \u03a6Lm (C1 ) 6= \u03a6Lm (C2 )\nwhere C1 , C2 are different generic irreducible elements of |G|) and \u03b2\nis a rational number such that \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) \u2212 \u03b2C is numerically equivalent\nto an effective Q-divisor, then \u03c6m is birational if one of the following conditions is satisfied, where we set \u03b1 := (m \u2212 1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 \u03b21 )\u03be and\n\u03b10 := \u2308\u03b1\u2309:\ni. \u03b1 > 2;\nii. \u03b10 \u2265 2 and C is non-hyperelliptic;\niii. \u03b1 > 0, C is non-hyperelliptic and C is an even divisor on S.\n0\n(2) One has the inequality \u03be \u2265 2g(C)\u22122+\u03b1\nif one of the following conm\nditions is satisfied:\niv. \u03b1 > 1;\nv. \u03b1 > 0 and C is an even divisor on S.\n\n2.3. Other necessary notions and lemmas.\nSince all 3-folds considered here have pg (X) > 0, we immediately\nhave the following fact which will be tacitly used throughout the paper:\nFact 2.3. Under the setting of 2.1, \u03c6m := \u03a6|mKX \u2032 | distinguishes different generic irreducible elements S of |M1 | for all m \u2265 2.\nWe will frequently use the following base point freeness due to [3, 4,\n12, 21]:\nFact 2.4. Let S0 be a minimal projective surface of general type and\npg (S0 ) > 0. Then |2KS0 | is base point free.\n\n\fSome birationality criteria on 3-folds\n\n7\n\nDefinition 2.5. Let Z be a normal projective Q-Gorenstein variety.\nLet \u03b8 : Z \u2032 \u2192 Z be a birational morphism and h : Z \u2032 \u2192 W be a fibration\nonto another normal variety W with dim(W ) = dim(Z) \u2212 1. Then we\ncall C := {\u03b8(F )|F is a fiber of h} a curve family on Z. For a general\nmember C \u2208 C , the rational number deg(C ) := (KZ * C) is referred to\nas the canonical degree of C .\nNote that deg(C ) is independent of the birational morphism \u03b8 by\nthe intersection theory.\nDefinition 2.6. Let S be a nonsingular projective surface. For a point\nP \u2208 S, P is said to be very general if P lies in the complement of the\nunion of countable curves on S.\nLemma 2.7. Let S be a nonsingular projective surface. Let L be a nef\nand big Q-divisor on S satisfying the following conditions:\n(1) L2 > 8.\n(2) (L * CP ) \u2265 4 for all irreducible curves CP passing through any\nvery general point P \u2208 S.\n\nThen the linear system |KS + \u2308L\u2309| separates two distinct points in very\ngeneral positions. Consequently it gives a birational map.\nProof. This is a direct result from the proof of Masek [14, Proposition\n4]. We keep the same notation there. Let p, q be two distinct very\ngeneral points on S. Then we are in the situation \u03bcp = \u03bcq = 0. Just\nset \u03b21,p = \u03b21,q = 2 and \u03b22,p = \u03b22,q = 2. Then our situation here\nfits into all numerical requirements there and, as a result, the proof\nfollows. Note, however, Masek's condition of \"M being ample\" is set to\nsecure the local positivity at every points in order to obtain base point\nfreeness and very ampleness. To obtain birationality, the \"nef and big\"\ncondition is sufficient.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.8. Let \u03c0 : X \u2032 \u2192 X be a birational morphism from a nonsingular model X \u2032 onto X which is a minimal projective 3-fold of general\ntype. Assume f : X \u2032 \u2192 P1 be a fibration with the general fiber F . Let\n\u03c3 : F \u2192 F0 be the birational contraction onto the minimal model. Set\nK3\n\u03c40 := 3KX2 .

Chen\n\nProof. (1) For any sufficiently large and divisible integer m > 0 (such\nthat m is divisible by the Cartier index of X), the Riemann-Roch on\nX \u2032 implies\n1 3 3\nPm (X \u2032 ) = h0 (X \u2032 , m\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )) \u2248 KX\nm.\n6\nOn the other hand, the Riemann-Roch on F gives\n1\nPm (F ) \u2248 KF20 m2 .\n2\n\u2032\nTherefore Pm (X ) > (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03b4)mPm (F ) for m \u226b 0. Consider the restriction maps:\n\u03b8\n\nt\nH 0 (X \u2032 , Mm \u2212 tF ) \u2212\u2192\nVm,t \u2282 H 0 (F, mKF )\n\nwhere t \u2265 0 and Vm,t is the image vector space. Since dim(Vm,t ) \u2264\nPm (F ) for all t, we have\nm\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) \u2212 (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03b4)mF \u2265 Mm \u2212 (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03b4)mF > 0\n\nfor all large and divisible integers m (such that (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03b4)m is integral).\nPick a large such integer m = l0 and set N := l0 while n := (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03b4)l0 .\nSo we get (i).\n(2) Statement (ii) follows directly from our canonical restriction inequality [9, Lemma 3.7] since mp0 7\u2192 \u03c40 in this situation. We are\ndone.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.9. Let S be a nonsingular projective surface on which there\nis a nef and big Q-divisor L and a smooth curve C with (L * C) > 0.\nL2\n. Then\nSet \u03bd0 := 2(L*C)\nL \u2265num (\u03bd0 \u2212 \u03b40 )C\n\nfor all very small rational numbers \u03b40 > 0.\n\nProof. This is similar to Lemma 2.8. For a very large and divisible\ninteger m, we have\n1\nh0 (S, mL) \u2248 L2 m2\n2\n0\nand h (C, mL|C ) \u2248 (L * C)m. Then the statement follows by simply\nconsidering the restriction maps:\nH 0 (S, mL) \u2212\u2192 H 0 (C, mL|C ).\n\nWe omit other details.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following result is also frequently used to distinguish curves on\nsurfaces.\nLemma 2.10. Let \u03c0 : X \u2032 \u2192 X be a birational morphism from nonsingular projective 3-fold X \u2032 onto a minimal 3-fold X of general type. Let\nf : X \u2032 \u2192 P1 be a fibration. Assume O(p) \u0592\u2192 f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 for some integer\np > 0. Then, for all t > 0 with |tp\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )| base point free, one has\nt(p + 2)\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2265 tp\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )\n\n\fSome birationality criteria on 3-folds\n\n9\n\nwhere F is a general fiber of f and \u03c3 : F \u2192 F0 is the contraction onto\nthe minimal model.\nProof. By assumption, one has\n\u2297t(p+2)\n\n\u2297tp\nf\u2217 \u03c9X\n\u2032 /P1 \u0592\u2192 f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032\n\n.\n\n\u2297tp\n\u2297tp\nBy the semi-positivity theorem for f\u2217 \u03c9X\n\u2032 /P1 , we see that f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 /P1 is\ngenerated by global sections. Thus the local sections along the general\n\u2297t(p+2)\nfiber F can be glued into some global sections of f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032\n. This\nimplies\n\n|t(p + 2)KX \u2032 ||F \u2283 |tp\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )|mov + (fixed divisor)\n= |tp\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )| + (fixed divisor)\n\nsince |tp\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )| is base point free. Or, in divisor language, one has\nt(p + 2)\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2265 Mt(p+2) |F \u2265 tp\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )\n\nwhere |Mt(p+2) | is the moving part of |t(p + 2)KX \u2032 |.\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Proof of Theorem 1.1 (Part 1)\n3.1. Characterization of the birationality of \u03c67 .\nWe start with the proof of Theorem 1.1(1). Since pg (X) \u2265 2, we\nhave an induced fibration f : X \u2032 \u2192 \u0393.\nAssume \u03c67 is non-birational. Then, by [7, Theorem 1.2 and Section\n4], one has pg (X) = 2, \u0393 \u223c\n= P1 and a general fiber F of f is a (1,2)\nsurface. We show the existence of the curve family C as claimed in the\nstatement. Pick a general fiber F and take |G| to be the moving part\nof |KF |. Take further necessary birational modifications to \u03c0 such that\n(and thus may assume) the relative canonical map of f is a morphism.\nBy the surface theory (see [2]), a generic irreducible element C of |G| is\na smooth curve of genus 2. We have m0 = 1, p = 1 and [9, Lemma 3.7]\nimplies \u03b2 7\u2192 21 . We have already known \u03be := (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) * C) \u2265 53 in [7,\nSection 4]. Take m = 6. Since \u03b16 \u2265 2\u03be > 1, Theorem 2.2 implies \u03be \u2265 23 .\nNow \u03be > 32 is impossible since, otherwise, \u03b17 \u2265 3\u03be > 2 and \u03c67 will be\nbirational by [9, Theorem 3.6], a contradiction. Thus \u03be = 32 . Take\nC := {\u03c0(Ct )|Ct is a fibre of the relative canonical map of f }. Clearly\ndeg(C ) = \u03be = 32 by the projection formula.\nConversely, assume pg (X) = 2 and there is a genus 2 curve family C\nof canonical degree 32 . We study the general fiber F of the canonically\ninduced fibration f : X \u2032 \u2192 \u0393.\nClaim 3.1.1. \u0393 \u223c\n= P1 and F must be a (1,2) surface.\nProof. Modulo further birational modifications, we may assume that\nthe curve family C is free on X \u2032 . Pick a general curve \u0108 \u2282 X \u2032 such\nthat \u03c0(\u0108) dominates a general curve in C on X. First, we see \u0108 \u2282 F\nfor some general fiber F . Otherwise, f (\u0108) = \u0393, h0 (\u0108, F |\u0108 ) \u2265 2 and\n\n\f10\n\nM. Chen\n\nthen (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )* \u0108) \u2265 deg(F |\u0108 ) \u2265 2 which contradicts to the assumption.\nSecondly, if g(\u0393) > 0, then we have \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u223c\n= \u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) by [9, Lemma\n4.7] and\n(\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) * \u0108) = (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F * \u0108) = (\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) * \u0108) \u2265 1\nsince \u0108 is moving in a family on F , which is again a contradiction.\nThus we have seen \u0393 \u223c\n= P1 .\nNow we study the numerical type of the general fiber F . We have\n2\n1\n= (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F * \u0108) \u2265 (\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) * \u0108),\n3\n2\nwhich implies (\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) * \u0108) = 1. Observing that \u0108 is moving, the\nHodge index theorem and the assumption g(\u0108) = 2 imply KF20 = 1.\nBy the surface theory and the proof of [8, Claim 2.14], F must be a\n(1,2) surface and \u0108 is the moving part of |KF |. So we have \u0108 = C as\na general member of |G| on F .\n\u0003\nClaim 3.1.2. |M7 ||C = |2KC |.\nProof. If C is a general curve in the moving part of |KF |, one has KF =\n\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )+E(0) and E(0) \u2229C is a single point P \u2208 C with 2P \u223c KC , which\nis due to the fact that |KF0 | has exactly one base point. In particular,\nwe have KF |C = 2P . This means that (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F + E\u03c0 |F )|C = KF |C =\n2P , once we fix a general fiber F and a general curve C on F .\nSince O\u0393 (1) \u0592\u2192 f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 , Lemma 2.10 implies 3\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2265 C. Now\nthe Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem ([13, 22]) gives\n|KX \u2032 + \u23085\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )\u2309 + F |F = |KF + \u23085\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )\u2309|F |\n\u2283 |KF + \u23082\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2309 + C| + (fixed divisor)\nand\n|KF + \u23082\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2309 + C||C = |KC + D|\n\nwith deg(D) \u2265 2\u03be \u2265 34 . Since \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2264 KF , we have D = 2P .\nNoting that |KX \u2032 + \u23085\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )\u2309 + F | + (fixed divisor) \u2282 |7KX \u2032 | and\n|KC + D| is movable, we have\n|M7 |C | \u2283 |M7 ||C \u2283 |KC + D| + (fixed divisor).\n, we get deg(M7 |C ) \u2264 4. Thus\nSince deg(M7 |C ) \u2264 7(\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F * C) = 14\n3\nthe only possibility is M7 |C \u223c KC +D and |M7 ||C = |KC +D| = |2KC |,\nwhich gives a finite map of degree 2.\n\u0003\nClearly \u03c67 |F distinguishes different general curves C, we see that \u03c67\nis generically finite of degree 2. So we conclude Theorem 1.1(1).\n\n\fSome birationality criteria on 3-folds\n\n11\n\n3.2. Birationality of \u03c66 .\nIn this subsection we shall prove Theorem 1.1(2).\nBy [7, Theorem 1.2, Theorem 3.3], we only need to assume pg (X) = 2\nand \u0393 \u223c\n= P1 to prove the birationality of \u03c66 .\nWe have an induced fibration f : X \u2032 \u2192 \u0393 where we pick a general\nfiber F .

Noting that both \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F\nand \u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) are nef, we get\n1\nL24 \u2265 16 * ( \u2212 \u03b5)2 * \u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )2 \u2265 3(2 \u2212 4\u03b5)2 > 8\n2\nwhenever \u03b5 is small enough.\n\n(3.3)\n\n(\u2021) For a very general point P \u2208 F , any curve CP passing through\nP is of general type, i.e. g(CP ) \u2265 2. Then an easy exercise will show\n(\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) * CP ) \u2265 2 simply due to the fact KF20 > 1. Pick a sequence of\nrational numbers {\u03b5Sn } which converges to zero. By the choice of P , we\nmay assume CP 6\u2282 n H\u03b5n . In particular, (CP * H\u03b5n ) \u2265 0 for all n > 0.\nThus\n1\n(L4 * CP ) \u2265 4( \u2212 \u03b5n )(\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) * CP ) = (2 \u2212 4\u03b5n )(\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) * Cp ).\n2\nTaking the limit while n 7\u2192 +\u221e, we have (L4 * CP ) \u2265 4.\nNow Lemma 2.7 implies that |KF + L4 | gives a birational map.

By [7, Theorem 1.2], we only need to study the cases pg (X) = 2, 3.\n4.1. \u03c65 in the case pg (X) = 3 and d1 = 2.\nWhen d1 = 2, a general fiber C of f is a curve of genus \u2265 2. Pick\na general member S \u2208 |M1 |. Take |G| := |S|S | where S|S \u2261 eC with\ne \u2265 1. Taking the restriction, we get\n\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S \u2261 S|S + E1\u2032 |S .\n\n\fSome birationality criteria on 3-folds\n\n13\n\nSet L := \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S which is an effective nef and big Q-divisor. Clearly,\none has L2 \u2265 \u03be by definition.\nClaim 4.1.1. When g(C) \u2265 3, \u03be > 1; when g(C) = 2, \u03be \u2265 1.\nProof. This is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.2. In fact, we have\np = 1 and \u03b2 = 1. When g(C) \u2265 3, Theorem 2.2 implies \u03be \u2265 34 > 1.\nWhen g(C) = 2, clearly one has \u03be \u2265 32 . Repeatedly taking suitable\ninteger m and running Theorem 2.2(2), one has no difficulty to obtain\n\u03be \u2265 1 (an easy exercise!).\n\u0003\n3\nClaim 4.1.2. KX\n> 1 if and only if L2 > 1.\n\nProof. To see this, we have the following inequality:\n3\nKX\n= \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )3 = (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )2 * S) + (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )2 * E1\u2032 ) \u2265 L2 .\n\nOn the other hand, if we take a sufficiently large integer m such that\n|m\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )| is base point free, then a general member T is a smooth\nsurface and we apply this to estimate L2 by the Hodge index theorem:\n1 \u2217\n1p \u2217\nL2 =\n(\u03c0 (KX )|T * S|T ) \u2265\n(\u03c0 (KX )|T )2 * (S|T )2\nm\nm\nq\nq\n\u2265\n\n3\nKX\n*\u03be \u2265\n\n3\nKX\n.\n\nSo the claim is true.\n\n\u0003\n\nClaim 4.1.3. When L2 > 1, |KS + \u23083L\u2309| gives a birational map.\nProof. In fact, we have L = \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) = C + E1\u2032 |S . There are two cases:\n(i) \u03be > 1; (ii) \u03be = 1.\nThe first case is easier since the vanishing theorem gives\n|KS + \u23082L\u2309 + C||C = |KC + \u23082L\u2309|C |\nand clearly the linear system on the right hand side gives an embedding\nas deg(\u23082L\u2309|C ) \u2265 2\u03be > 2. Thus |KS + 3L| gives a birational map.\nAssume, from now on, \u03be = 1. Then L2 > 1 implies (L * E1\u2032 |S ) > 0.\nLet us consider the Zariski decomposition of the effective Q-divisor\nJ\u02c6 := L + E1\u2032 |S . Since L is nef and E1\u2032 |S is effective, we may write\nE1\u2032 |S = N + + N \u2212 such that:\n(1) L + N + is nef;\n(2) (L + N + ) * N \u2212 = 0;\n(3) both N + and N \u2212 are effective Q-divisors.\nClearly, (L * N + ) > 0. We want to show (C * N + ) > 0. In fact, if\nN \u2212 \u2261 0, then we have (C * N + ) = \u03be > 0. Thus we may always assume\n2\nN \u2212 6\u2261 0, which means N \u2212 < 0 since L + N + is nef and big. From\nthe property (2), we see (N + * N \u2212 ) = \u2212(L * N \u2212 ) \u2264 0 since L is nef.\n2\nSince L = C + N + + N \u2212 , so (L * N + ) > 0 implies (C * N + ) + N + > 0.\nSuppose (C * N + ) = 0, then N + is vertical with respect to the fibration\n\n\f14\n\nM. Chen\n\non S and N + 2 \u2264 0, which contradicts to N + 2 = (C * N + ) + N + 2 > 0.\nSo we have proved (C * N + ) > 0.\nNoting that\n|KS + \u23082L + N + \u2309 + C| + (fixed divisor) \u2282 |KS + \u23083L\u2309|\n\nand that the vanishing theorem gives\n\n|KS + \u23082L + N + \u2309 + C||C = |KC + D2 |\n\nwith deg(D2 ) \u2265 2\u03be + (C * N + ) > 2. Thus |KS + \u23082L + N + \u2309 + C| gives\na birational map and so does |KS + \u23083L\u2309|. We are done.\n\u0003\nOn the other hand, Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing gives\n|KX \u2032 + \u23083\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )\u2309 + S||S = |KS + \u23083\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )\u2309|S |\n\u2283 |KS + \u23083L\u2309| + (fixed divisor)\n\n3\nSo we see that \u03c65 is birational whenever KX\n> 1.\n3\n2\nWhen KX = 1, automatically L = 1 and \u03be = 1 by Claim 4.1.2.\nThus g(C) = 2.\nSo we have proved the following:\n\nTheorem 4.1. Let X be a minimal projective 3-fold of general type.\n3\nAssume KX\n> 1, pg (X) = 3 and d1 = 2. Then \u03c65 is birational.\nRemark 4.2. Theorem 4.1 is sharp due to Example A (3). It is inter3\nesting to know whether KX\n> 1 is necessary to get the birationality of\n\u03c65 .\n4.2. \u03c65 in the case pg (X) = 3 and d1 = 1.\nPick a general fiber F of the induced fibration f : X \u2032 \u2192 \u0393. By [7,\nTheorem 3.3], it is sufficient to assume b = g(\u0393) = 0, i.e. \u0393 \u223c\n= P1 .\nNote that pg (X) > 0 implies pg (F ) > 0 and thus F must be among the\nfollowing types by the surface theory:\n(i) (KF20 , pg (F )) = (1, 2);\n(ii) (KF20 , pg (F )) = (2, 3);\n(iii) other surfaces with pg (F ) > 0.\nIt suffices to show \u03c65 |F is birational for a general fiber F . One has\nm0 = 1 and p = 2. By [9, Lemma 3.7], for any rational number \u03b5 > 0,\nthere is an effective Q-divisor H\u03b5 such that\n2\n\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2261 ( \u2212 \u03b5)\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) + H\u03b5 .\n(4.1)\n3\nClaim 4.2.1. If F is of Type (ii), \u03c65 is birational.\nProof. Take |G| to be the moving part of |KF |. Then a general member\nC \u2208 |G| is a smooth curve of genus 3 and |G| gives a generically finite\nmap (see [2, p226]). Besides, Relation (4.1) implies \u03b2 \u2265 32 \u2212 \u03b5 for any\nsmall \u03b5 > 0 and thus \u03be \u2265 23 (\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) * C) \u2265 34 . Take m = 4 and then\n\n\fSome birationality criteria on 3-folds\n\n15\n\n\u03b14 := (4 \u2212 1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 \u03b21 )\u03be > 1. By Theorem 2.2, one gets \u03be \u2265 23 . Since\nKawamata-Viehweg vanishing gives\n|KX \u2032 +\u23083\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )\u2309+F ||F \u2283 |KF +\u23083\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2309|+(fixed divisor) (4.2)\nwhere the last linear system distinguishes different general curves C\nand \u03b15 \u2265 2\u03be \u2265 3, Theorem 2.2 implies the birationality of \u03c65 .\n\u0003\nClaim 4.2.2. If F is of Type (iii), \u03c65 is birational.\nProof. We take |G| = |2\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )|. By the surface theory, we know\nthat |G| is base point free and a general member C of |G| is nonhyperelliptic. Lemma 2.10 implies that \u03c64 |F distinguishes different\ngeneral curves C. On the other hand, Equation (4.1) implies \u03b2 7\u2192 31 . So\n\u03b15 = (5 \u2212 1 \u2212 21 \u2212 \u03b21 )\u03be > 0. Noting that C is even and non-hyperelliptic,\nTheorem 2.2 implies the birationality of \u03c65 .\n\u0003\n3\nClaim 4.2.3. If F is of Type (i) and KX\n> 6, then \u03c65 is birational.\n3\nProof. On F , take |G| to be the moving part of |KF |. Since KX\n> 6,\n2\nwe have \u03c40 > 2 and Lemma 2.8 implies \u03b2 > 3 . Similar to the case with\nF being of type (ii), it suffices to study \u03c65 |C . Recall we have m0 = 1\nand p = 2. We have \u03be = (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F * C) \u2265 \u03b2 * (\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) * C) > 32 .\nRepeatedly taking a suitable integer m and running Theorem 2.2(2),\none would get \u03be \u2265 1. Now take m = 5. We see \u03b15 > 2\u03be \u2265 2. Thus, by\nTheorem 2.2, \u03c65 is birational.\n\u0003\n\nSo we can conclude the following:\nTheorem 4.3. Let X be a minimal projective 3-fold of general type.\n3\nAssume KX\n> 6, pg (X) = 3 and d1 = 1. Then \u03c65 is birational.\n4.3. \u03c65 in the case pg (X) = 2.\nAutomatically d1 = 1 and this is parallel to 3.2, but we are studying \u03c65 instead. We keep the notation there and will omit redundant\narguments.\nClaim 4.3.1. If KF20 \u2265 19, \u03c65 is birational.\nProof. The Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequaity K 2 \u2264 9\u03c7 implies\n\n1\npg (F ) = \u03c7(OF ) \u2212 1 + q(F ) \u2265 KF20 \u2212 1 > 1.\n9\nTake |G| to be the moving part of |KF |. Modulo birational modifications, we may assume that |G| is base point free and so a generic\nirreducible element C of |G| is smooth. We still have Relation (4.2) and\nset L = \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F . The linear system |KF + \u23083L\u2309| clearly distinguishes\ndifferent general curves C.\n\n\f16\n\nM. Chen\n\n2\nIf |G| is not composed of a pencil, we have Cq\n\u2265 2. By (3.2), we\nhave \u03b2 7\u2192 21 . Since \u03b15 \u2265 \u03be \u2265 12 (\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) * C) \u2265 21 KF20 * C 2 > 2, \u03c65 is\nbirational by Theorem 2.2.\nIf |G| is composed of a pencil and KF20 \u2265 19, pick a generic irreducible\nelement C. We study the rational number \u03be = (L * C). If \u03be > 2, then\n\u03b15 \u2265 \u03be > 2 and \u03c65 is birational. Otherwise, we have \u03be \u2264 2.

Note\n1\n1\n\u2217\nthat \u03be \u2265 2 (\u03c3 (KF0 ) * C) \u2265 1. Now \u03b15 \u2265 (5 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b2 )\u03be > 2 and so \u03c65\nis birational by Theorem 2.2 once more.\n\u0003\nL \u2265num (\n\n3\nClaim 4.3.2. If KX\n> 81 and KF20 \u2264 18, \u03c65 is birational.\n\nProof. We prove the statement by analyzing different numerical types\nof F .\na. Assume 3 \u2264 KF20 \u2264 18.

By the vanishing theorem, we have\n2\n2\n|KX \u2032 + \u23084\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) \u2212 E3/2 \u2309||F = |KF + \u23084\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) \u2212 F \u2212 E3/2 \u2309|F |\n3\n3\n\u2283 |KF + \u2308Q\u2309| + (fixed divisor)\n\nwhere\n\n10\n2\nQ := (4\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) \u2212 F \u2212 E3/2 )|F \u2261 \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2265num 2\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ).\n3\n3\nNow by a similar argument to (\u2021) in Claim 3.2.1, |KF + \u2308Q\u2309| satisfies\nthe condition of Lemma 2.7. Thus |KF + \u2308Q\u2309| gives a birational map\nand so does \u03c65 .\n3\nb. Assume KF20 = 2. As long as KX\n> 24, we have \u03c40 > 4 which\nmeans, by Lemma 2.8,\n\n\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) \u2265num (4 + \u03b4)F\n\nfor some very small rational number \u03b4 > 0 and\n4\n\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2265num ( + \u03b50 )\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )\n5\nfor some small rational number \u03b50 > 0.

Now an easy exercise by applying the vanishing theorem on surfaces shows that KF + \u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) +\n\u2308Qb \u2309 is effective due to the fact that \u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) is 1-connected. This\nmeans that \u03c65 |F distinguishes different general curves C in |G| :=\n|2\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )|. Finally one sees \u03c65 is birational by Theorem 2.2.\n\n3\nc. Assume KF20 = 1. As long as KX\n> 12, we have \u03c40 > 4 and\nthen, similarly, we are reduced to prove that |KF + 3\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) + \u2308Qc \u2309|\ngives a birational map where Qc is certain nef and big Q-divisor. This\nis the case, according to Theorem 2.2, by taking |G| := |2\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )| if\npg (F ) = 1 and |G| to be the moving part of |KF | if pg (F ) = 2. We also\nleave this as an easy exercise.\n3\nIn a word, \u03c65 is birational when KX\n> 81 and pg (X) = 2.\n\u0003\n\nWe have proved the following:\nTheorem 4.4.

Characterizing the birationality of \u03c64 (Part A)\nBy Chen-Zhang [9, Theorem 1.3], we only need to study the cases\npg (X) = 2, 3, 4.\n5.1. \u03c64 in the case pg (X) = 4 and d1 = 3.\nKeep the same setting and notation as in 2.1.

So\nit suffices to prove the birationality (or non-birationality) of \u03c64 |C . In\nfact, Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing gives, furthermore,\n|KF + \u23082L \u2212 E1\u2032 |F \u2309||C = |KC + D3 |\n\nwhere D3 := \u23082L \u2212 E1\u2032 |F \u2212 C\u2309|C with deg(D3 ) \u2265 \u03be := (L * C).\n3\nClaim 5.1.1.

We do not\nknow if this can really happen. It might be possible to analyze it in a\nsimilar way to that of Claim 5.2.4. But then, since the surface \u03a3 is of\ndegree 3 in P3 , there would be fairly many cases to do. Such a surface \u03a3\ncan be either normal or non-normal (see, for instance, Abe-Furushima\n[1], Miyanishi-Zhang [15, 16], Reid [18] and Ye [23]).\n\n\fSome birationality criteria on 3-folds\n\n21\n\n5.3. \u03c64 in the case pg (X) = 4 and d1 = 1.\nWe have an induced fibration f : X \u2032 \u2192 \u0393 with the general fiber\nF .

If F is of Type (a), \u03c64 is automatically non-birational\nand X has a natural curve family C with (KX * C0 ) = 1 for the general\nmember C0 \u2208 C .\nProof. Just take the relative canonical map of f as what we have seen\nin [9, Theorem 1.4]. The curve family C is composed of all those fibers\nof the relative canonical map of f . We omit more details to avoid\nunnecessary redundancy.\n\u0003\nClaim 5.3.2. If F is of Type (b), then \u03c64 is birational.\nProof. According to [9, 4.8], it is sufficient to assume g(\u0393) = 0, i.e.\n\u0393\u223c\n= P1 . Pick a general fiber F of f .

Thus it follows that \u03c64 is birational.\n\u0003\n3\nClaim 5.3.3. If F is of Type (c) and KX\n> 12, \u03c64 is birational.\n\nProof. Take |G| := |2\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )|. Lemma 2.10 says that \u03c64 distinguishes\ndifferent general members of |G|. Since, under the condition of the\nclaim, one has \u03c40 > 3, Lemma 2.8 implies\n\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) \u2265num (3 + \u03b40 )F\nfor some very small rational number \u03b40 > 0 and\n8\nL1/3 \u2261 \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2265num (2 + \u03b70 )\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )\n3\nwhich directly implies the birationality of \u03c64 |F by Theorem 2.2. We\nare done.\n\u0003\nSo we have proved the following:\n\n\f22\n\nM. Chen\n\nTheorem 5.5. Let X be a minimal projective 3-fold of general type.\n3\nAssume pg (X) = 4, KX\n> 12 and d1 = 1.

(=Theorem 1.2(1)) Let X be a minimal projective 33\nfold of general type. Assume pg (X) = 4 and KX\n> 28. Then \u03c64 is\nbirational if and only if X does not contain any genus 2 curve family\nof canonical degree 1.\nProof. If \u03c64 is non-birational, then Theorem 5.1, Theorem 5.3 and\nTheorem 5.5 imply that X is either canonically fibred by curves of\ncanonical degree 1 or canonically fibred by (1,2) surfaces. For the later\ncase, there is also a genus 2 curve family of canonical degree 1 by Claim\n5.3.1.\nConversely, if X admits a genus 2 curve family C of canonical degree\n1, we see d1 \u2264 2. Otherwise, (KX * C0 ) = (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) * C\u03030 ) \u2265 (S * C\u03030 ) \u2265 2\nfor a general member C0 \u2208 C since |S||C\u03030 gives a generically finite map,\nwhere C\u03030 denotes the strict transform of C0 .\nNow assume d1 = 2. We want to show that C is the canonical curve\nfamily, i.e. C = C\u03030 . Otherwise, (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) * C\u03030 ) \u2265 (S * C\u03030) \u2265 2 since S|C\u03030\nis moving and g(C\u03030) = 2, a contradiction. Now since (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) * C) = 1,\n\u03c64 is non-birational by Theorem 5.3.\nAssume d1 = 1. If C\u03030 6\u2282 F for a general fiber F , then F |C\u03030 is moving\nand thus (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) * C\u03030 ) \u2265 (F * C\u03030 ) \u2265 2, a contadiction. Thus C\u03030 \u2282 F .\nIf F is not a (1,2) surface, we have\n2\n4\n(\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) * C\u03030 ) \u2265 (\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) * C\u03030 ) \u2265\n3\n3\nsince C\u03030 is moving on F , which is again impossible. So F is a (1,2)\nsurface. Clearly \u03c64 is non-birational.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.7. When \u03c64 is non-birational, the curve family in Theorem\n1.2(1) is uniquely determined by X.

When F is neither a\n(2,3) surface nor a (1,1) surface, |KF + 2\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) + \u2308Qf \u2309| satisfies the\ncondition of Lemma 2.7 by a parallel argument to (\u2021) in the proof of\nClaim 3.2.1 and thus it also gives a birational map. Finally if F is a\n(1,1) surface, Lemma 2.8 actually gives \u03c40 > 200 and we are in a much\nbetter situation. The vanishing theorem again allows us to consider the\n199\nlinear system |KF + \u2308Q1,1 \u2309| where Q1,1 \u2265num (2 + 201\n)\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ) and Q1,1\nis nef and big. Clearly, this linear system also satisfies the condition\nof Lemma 2.7 still by a similar argument to (\u2021). In a word, \u03c64 is\nbirational.\nConversely, if X has a genus 2 curve family C of canonical degree 1,\n\u03c64 is non-birational. This can be seen by a similar argument to that of\n[9, Proposition 4.6]. The point is that, while \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) * C) = 1, we will\nbe able to see |4KX \u2032 ||C = |2KC | for a general curve C \u2208 C (This is not\na trivial statement at all!). Since g(C) = 2, \u03c64 can not be birational.\nWe omit more details and leave it as an exercise.\n\u0003\n\u03bd0 \u2265\n\n\f26\n\nM. Chen\n\nAcknowledgment.
