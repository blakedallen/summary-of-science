QWs have been demonstrated using nuclear magnetic resonance [4], trapped ions [5], single photons in bulk [6] and fibre optics [7] and the\nscattering of light in waveguide arrays [8\u201310]. With decoherence the spreading of the QW is transited from a ballistic\nto diffusive scaling [11, 12] and with quantumness losing the QW is transited to RW [13, 14].\nAn open quantum system loses its quantumness when information of the quantum state leaks into the environment\naround it. The unidirectional flow of information in which the decoherence and noise act consistently characterizes\na Markovian process [15]. However, there are some systems such as soft- and condensed-matter systems strongly\ncoupling to the environment and the coupling leads to a different regime where information also flows back into the\nsystem from the surroundings, which characterizes a non-Markovian process [16]. During a Markovian process, the\ndistinguishability tends to monotonically decrease for pair of states, here in this paper, the quantum walker+coin\nstates [11\u201314]. Memory effects caused by the information flowing back to the system during a non-Markovian process\ncan temporarily increase it for the walker+coin states. In this paper, we use quantum correlation between quantum\nwalker and his coin as a distinguishability to present the behavior of a QW on a line with a non-Markovian dephasing\ncoin. The quantum correlation between quantum walker and his coin decays quickly but is interrupted by revivals.\nCorrespondingly, in the short time regime, the position variance of a non-Markovian decoherent QW deviates from\nboth those of the ideal QW and RW. In the long time limit, the quantum correlation tends to be zero and the position\nvariance shows a diffusive spread.\nThis paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we introduce an idea QW on a line. In Sec. III, the nonMarkovian dephasing on the coin state-two-level system is shown. We study the effects from the non-Markovian\ndephasing on coin. Compared to both idea QWs and RWs, non-Markovian decoherent QWs show different behavior\nin the short time regime. In Sec. IV, the quantum correlation between quantum walker and his non-Markovian\ndephasing coin is studied via the quantum discord (QD) and measurement-induced disturbance (MID). It is observed\nthat both of QD and MID show oscillating behavior in the short time regime and tend to zero in the long time limit.\nIn Sec. V, we analyze the behavior of non-Markovian decoherent QWs in the long time limit and observe that because\nof disappearance of the quantum correlation between quantum walker and his coin, a non-Markovian decoherent QW\nin the long time regime shows a diffusive behavior. Finally we summarize the paper briefly.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nAN IDEAL QW ON A LINE\n\nFor an ideal QW on a line [17, 18], the Hilbert space is\nH = Hw \u2297 Hc\n\n(1)\n\nwith the walker Hilbert space Hw spanned by the position vectors {|xi} and Hc the coin space spanned by two\northogonal vectors which we denote |\u00b11i. Each step by the walker is effected by two subsequent unitary operators:\nthe coin-flip operator\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 1 1\n,\n(2)\nC =H = \u221a\n2 1 \u22121\nfor H the Hadamard matrix and the conditional-translation operator\nF = S \u2297 |1i h1| + S \u2020 \u2297 |\u22121i h\u22121| ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere S |xi = |x + 1i and S \u2020 |xi = |x \u2212 1i. The resultant step operator is U = F (1 \u2297 C) with 1 the identity operator\non Hw .\nThe choice of initial state \u03c8(t = 0) is important in studies of QWs because the interference features sensitively\ndepend on the choice of state. This sensitivity is persistent because the dynamics are unitary hence do not die out.\nOn the other hand the general properties of QWs do not depend on the choice of initial state so the choice of initial\nstate is not crucial provided that the focus is on such characterization.\nAs we are interested in general properties, the initial state is not important so we choose the initial state with the\nwalker at the origin of a line and holding a coin in an equal superposition of the +1 and \u22121 states:\n1\n\u03c8(t = 0) = \u221a |0i (|1i + i |\u22121i).\n2\n\n(4)\n\nAfter t steps, the final state of the walker+coin system is\n|\u03c8(t)i = U t |\u03c8(0)i .\n\n(5)\n\nWe now follow the evolution by performing a Fourier transform of the evolution operator to the \"momentum\" k space.\nThe eigenvectors\nX\n|ki =\neikx |xi ,\n(6)\nx\n\nof S and S \u2020 in Eq. (3) have the eigenrelations\nS |ki = e\u2212ik |ki , S \u2020 |ki = eik |ki\nfor k a continuous real quantity. The inverse transformation is\nZ \u03c0\ndk \u2212ikx\n|xi =\ne\n|ki .\n\u2212\u03c0 2\u03c0\nThe walker is initialized at the origin of a line so the walker's initial state is\nZ \u03c0\ndk\n|ki .\n|0i =\n\u2212\u03c0 2\u03c0\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nIn the {|ki} basis for the walker, the evolution operator becomes\nU |ki \u2297 |\u03a6ic = |ki \u2297 Uk |\u03a6ic ,\n\n(10)\n\nwith |\u03a6ic the coin state and\nUk =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ne\u2212ik e\u2212ik\n.\neik \u2212eik\n\n(11)\n\n\f\u039a\n\n3\n\n1\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n-0.25\n-0.5\n-0.75\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100\n\nt\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The rate \u03ba as a function of time t with g0 = 1 and different \u03b7: \u03b7 = 0.01 in red, \u03b7 = 0.05 in green, \u03b7 = 0.1\nin blue presenting non-Markovian dephasing and \u03b7 = 10 in black presenting Markovian dephasing.\n\nThe general density operator for the initial state of the system in the k basis can be expressed as\nZ \u03c0\nZ\ndk \u03c0 dk \u2032\n|ki hk \u2032 | \u2297 |\u03a60 i h\u03a60 | .\n\u03c1(0) =\n\u2212\u03c0 2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 2\u03c0\n\n(12)\n\nThe final state after t steps is\n1\n\u03c1(t) =\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\ndk\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\ndk \u2032 |ki hk \u2032 | \u2297 Ukt |\u03a60 i h\u03a60 | (Uk\u2020 )t .\n\nIn terms of the superoperator Lkk\u2032 \u00d4 = Uk \u00d4Uk\u2020 ,\nZ \u03c0\nZ \u03c0\n1\ndk\ndk \u2032 |ki hk \u2032 | \u2297 Ltkk\u2032 |\u03a60 i h\u03a60 | .\n\u03c1(t) =\n(2\u03c0)2 \u2212\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nThe walker's position is on a line labeled x with the initial position localized at 0.

Open quantum system loses its quantumness when information about\nthe state leaks into its surroundings. Unidirectional flow of information characterizes a Markovian process [15].\n\n\f4\nWhereas, for a non-Markovian process [3], information also flows back into the system. Recently, though it is not\nwell understood yet, non-Markovian processes with memory have become of central importance in the study of open\nsystem for both theory [19\u201322] and experiments [23\u201328].\nSuppose that before each unitary flip of the coin, a completely positive map is performed on the coin. We consider\na pure dephasing quantum process for which the density matrix \u03c1c (t) = Trw \u03c1(t) of the open system evolves according\nto the master equation\nd\n\u01eb(t)\n\u03b3(t)\n\u03c1c (t) = \u2212i\n[\u03c3z , \u03c1c (t)] +\n[\u03c3z \u03c1c (t)\u03c3z , \u03c1c (t)] .\ndt\n2\n2\n\n(18)\n\nHere \u01eb(t) represents the time-dependent energy shift and \u03b3(t) the time-dependent rate of the decay channel described\nby the Pauli operator \u03c3z . The dephasing process influences the coherence between the walker and his coin and the\nevolution can be described by the time-dependent function\n\u001a Z t\n\u001b\n\u03ba(t) = exp \u2212\ndt\u2032 [\u03b3(t\u2032 ) + i\u01eb(t\u2032 )]\n(19)\n0\n\nwhich is connected to the energy shift and the decay rate of the master equation (18) by the relations\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03ba\u0307(t)\n\u03ba\u0307(t)\n, \u03b3(t) = \u2212Re\n.\n\u01eb(t) = \u2212Im\n\u03ba(t)\n\u03ba(t)\n\n(20)\n\nIf the relaxation rates are positive function \u03b3(t) \u2265 0, the generator in Eq. (18) is in Lindblad form for each fixed\nt \u2265 0. Such a process with \u03b3(t) \u2265 0 may be called time-dependent Markovian. The generalized master equation\ninvolving a certain memory kernel can describe a non-Markovian process, in which the rate \u03b3(t) must take on negative\nvalues for some interval of time. In the Markovian regime, information of the coin state leaks into its surroundings and\n|\u03ba(t)| is a monotonically decreasing function of time. In the non-Markovian environment, in contrast, information also\nflows back into the system of coin state and a revival of the distinguishability can be observed in the time evolution.\nWith the definition of non-Markovianity, we see that an increase of |\u03ba(t)| leads to a negative rate \u03b3(t) in the generator\nof the master equation (18). As an example, we consider the case of a Lorentzian reservoir spectral density which\nis on resonance with the coin qubit transition frequency and leads to an exponential two point correlation function\nf (t) = g0 \u03b7e\u2212\u03b7|t| /2, where g0 describes the coupling strength between the coin qubit and environment and \u03b7 denotes\nthe spectral width (here we consider the coin qubit coupled to a damped Jaynes-Cummings model).

We see that for weak couplings, g0 < \u03b7/2, |\u03ba (t) | decreases monotonically. The correlation\nfunction f (t) tends to \u03b4(t) with \u03b7 increasing. For \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e, f (t) = \u03b4(t) and the noise of different time is not correlated.\nWhereas, in the strong coupling regime g0 > \u03b7/2, d turns to be a complex number and |\u03ba (t) | can be rewritten as\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u2032 \u0013\n\u0012 \u2032 \u0013\u0015\ndt\n\u03b7\ndt\n\u2212\u03b7t/2\ncos\n\u03ba (t) = e\n+ \u2032 sin\n(23)\n2\nd\n2\nwith d\u2032 = Im {d} and starts to oscillate, showing non-Markovian behavior [19\u201328].\nThe plots of \u03ba(t) are shown in Fig. 1. In the Markovian regime, for example g0 = 1 and \u03b7 = 10, the flow of\ninformation goes only from the system into the environment, and \u03ba(t) decreases monotonically. In the non-Markovian\nregime, such as g0 = 1, and \u03b7 = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 respectively, memory effects however can temporarily increase it. The\nfunction \u03ba(t) decreases faster at t = 0 but will be interrupted by revivals which are due to memory effects on quantum\ncorrelations between the quantum walker and his coin.\nThe corresponding dynamical map which maps the coin state \u03c1c (0) to the state \u03c1c (t) at time t\n00 01\n\u2217\n01 10\n10 11\n11\n\u03c100\nc = \u03c1c , \u03c1c = \u03ba (t)\u03c1c , \u03c1c = \u03ba(t)\u03c1c , \u03c1c = \u03c1c .\n\n(24)\n\n\f5\nThis map can also be written by a set of operators {A1 , A2 } on the coin degree of freedom which satisfy\nX\nA\u2020n An = 1,\n\n(25)\n\nn=1,2\n\nwhere\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\np\n1 \u2212 |\u03ba(t)|2 |\u03ba(t)|\n|\u03ba(t)|\n|0i h0| + r\nA1 =\n\u0010\n\u0011 |1i h1| ,\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\n2\np\n2\n2\n\u2217\n2\n2\n|\u03ba(t)| + 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 |\u03ba(t)|\n\u03ba (t) |\u03ba(t)| + 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 |\u03ba(t)|\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\n2 |\u03ba(t)|\n1\n\u2212\n1\n\u2212\n|\u03ba(t)|\n|\u03ba(t)|\nr\nA2 = r\n\u0011 |0i h0| +\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u00112 |1i h1| .\np\np\n2\n2\n2\n2\n|\u03ba(t)| + 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 |\u03ba(t)|\n\u03ba(t) |\u03ba(t)| + 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 |\u03ba(t)|\n1\u2212\nr\n\n(26)\n\nConsidering the initial state is\n\u03c1(0) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\ndk\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\ndk \u2032\n|ki hk \u2032 | \u2297 |\u03a60 i h\u03a60 | .\n2\u03c0\n\nLet the QW proceed for t steps.

As we know, without decoherence the variance\nof position distribution of QW is quadratically dependent on time t. With Markovian dephasing on coin, in the\nlong time limit the transition from a ballistic to a diffusion spreading behavior is observed. In this paper, we will\nshow the behavior of a QW with non-Markovian dephasing coin. The variance is used as a signature of the QW\ncompared to RW. In the short time regime we can calculate the variance of position distribution numerically. In\nFig. 2 from the numerical results we can see the variance as a function of time starts to oscillate from the first several\nsteps and the period of oscillations depends on the coefficient d. Compared to that of ideal QW, in the short time\nregime (t . 100) the variance of the QW with non-Markovian dephasing coin deviates from a ballistic spreading\nbehavior. However, in comparison with RW, the oscillating variance neither shows a diffusion behavior, which is\ndue to effect on quantum correlations between quantum walker and his coin from the non-Markovian decoherence.\nFrom the numerical calculations the position variance of a RW distribution is the lower bound of that of QW with\nnon-Markovian dephasing coin.\nIn Fig. 3, we plot position distribution for a QW with a non-Markovian dephasing coin (g0 = 1 and \u03b7 = 0.01) at\nthe 38th, 42nd, 46th, and 50th steps. At the 38th step, the position distribution shows RW behavior, and at the 42nd\nand 46th steps, there are two small peaks higher than the others nearby in the position distribution. It shows the\nmemory effect from non-Markovian decoherence draws QW behavior back a little. The small peaks disappear at the\n50th step. The plots of position distribution show the behavior of QW with non-Markovian dephasing coin oscillates\nbetween the quantum (ballistic) and classical (diffusive) behaviors.\nIV.\n\nQUANTUM CORRELATIONS DYNAMICS IN NON-MARKOVIAN ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe signature of a decoherent discrete-time QW on a line can be demonstrated in various ways such as the position\nprobability distribution becoming increasingly Gasussian, with a concomitant fall in the standard deviation. Both of\nthem do not recover the correlations between the quantum walker and his coin, which is known as the reason causing\n\n\fvar\n\n6\n\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100\n\n60\n\n80 100\n\nt\n\n200\nvar\n\n150\n100\n50\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\nt\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The variances for a QW on a line after t = 100 steps with a perfect coin in dotted-line, with a nonMarkovian dephasing coin with parameters\ng0 = 1 and \u03b7 = 0.01 in red and \u03b7 = 0.05 in green, \u03b7 = 0.1 in blue and \u03b7 = 10 in\n\u221a\nblack.

In this section we study the quantum correlation of a decoherent QW by two popular\nmeasures, measurement-induced disturbance (MID) [29\u201331] and quantum discord (QD) [32, 33].\nGiven the walker+coin state \u03c1(t), let the density matrix for the system be diagonalized to\nX j j\npi \u03a0i ,\n(30)\n\u03c1i =\nj\n\nfor i = w, c, where {\u03a0ji } is a complete projection-valued measure (i.e. using von Neumann measurements) for walker w\nor coin c. Summing over joint projections on the state yields the diagonalized state\nX\n\u03a0\u03c1(t) =\n(31)\n1w \u2297 \u03a0kc \u03c1(t)1w \u2297 \u03a0kc .\nk\n\nThe leftmost \u03a0 is an operator on the density matrix that diagonalizes it in the spectral basis corresponding to \u03a0ji\nprojective measurements. The operator \u03a0 can also be described as a 'local measurement strategy'.\nCorrelations between the walker \u03c1w and coin state \u03c1c are regarded as classical if there is a unique local measurement\nstrategy \u03a0 leaving \u03a0\u03c1(t) unaltered from the original walker+coin state \u03c1(t) [29\u201331]. We ascertain whether the\nwalker+coin state is 'quantum' by determining whether a local measurement strategy exists that leaves the state\nunchanged.\nThe degree of quantumness is given by the MID [29\u201331]\nQ [\u03c1(t)] = I [\u03c1(t)] \u2212 I [\u03a0\u03c1(t)] ,\n\n(32)\n\nfor I [\u03c1(t)] = S [\u03c1w (t)] + S [\u03c1c (t)] \u2212 [\u03c1(t)] the quantum mutual information and S [\u03c1(t)] = \u2212Tr [\u03c1(t) log2 \u03c1(t)] denotes\nvon Neumann entropy.

Accordingly, Eq. (32) is interpreted as\nthe difference between the total and classical correlations, which are represented by the quantum mutual information\nand the mutual information.\nQD [32, 33] is defined by\nD [\u03c1(t)] = I [\u03c1(t)] \u2212 sup I [\u03a0\u03c1(t)] .\n\n(33)\n\n\u03a0\n\nThe MID has an operational definition, unlike QD, it also tends to overestimate non-classicality because of lack of\noptimization over local measurements. Applied to QWs, we find that MID, while acting as a loose upper bound on\nQD, still tends to reflect well trends in the behavior of the latter.\nWe numerically calculate the MID and QD for a QW with perfect, Markovian and non-Markovian dephasing coins\nin the short time regime. The quantum correlation between quantum walker and his coin presented by the MID\nand QD is oscillating for the first several steps (. 100) shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Without decoherence there is\nno difference between MID and QD. Memory effects caused by the non-Markovianity of the environment deviate the\nMID and QD from monotonically behavior as that during the Markovian process. Both MID and QD decay steeply\nand interrupted by revivals. The period of oscillating is as same as that of corresponding position variance, which\nproves that quantum correlation between quantum walker and his coin results in the behavior of the QW. Either of\nthe MID and QD tends to zero with time increasing. Whereas for ideal QWs, both MID and QD do not decrease with\ntime as shown in [34, 35]. From the numerical results one can see the quantum correlation in the case of Markovian\ndecoherence is the lower bound of that with Non-Markovian decoherence, which explains the reason that the position\nvariance of a RW distribution provides the lower bound of that of QW with non-Markovian dephasing coin. In\ncomparison of MID and QD shown in Fig. 4(c), both of them can show the quantum correlation between quantum\nwalker and his coin changing with time and MID oscillates with bigger amplitude than QD, which makes that the\nMID might be better signature for observing in this case.\n\n\fMID\n\n8\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100\n\n60\n\n80 100\n\nQD\n\nt\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\nt\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100\n\nt\nFIG. 4: (Color online) (a) The MID, (b) QD for a QW on a line after t = 100 steps with perfect (in black), non-Markovian\ndephasing coin (in red) and Markovian dephasing coin (in blue), respectively.

We observe that\nboth MID and QD decrease with time and tend to zero in the long time limit. That means the quantum correlation will\ndisappear for long enough time. In this section, we will show in the long time regime, the behavior of a non-Markovian\ndecoherent QW.\n\n\f9\nThe probability for the walker to reach a point x at time t is\nP (x; t) = Tr{|xi hx| \u03c1(t)}\nZ \u03c0\nZ \u03c0\n\u2032\n1\n=\ndk\ndk \u2032 e\u2212i(k\u2212k )x Tr{Ltkk\u2032 |\u03a60 i h\u03a60 |}.\n(2\u03c0)2 \u2212\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n(34)\n\nThus we can calculate the moments of this distribution:\nX\nhxm i =\nxm P (x; t)\nx\n\n(\u22121)m\n=\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\ndk\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\ndk \u2032 \u03b4 (m) (k \u2212 k \u2032 )Tr{Ltkk\u2032 |\u03a60 i h\u03a60 |}.\n\n(35)\n\nWe can then invert the order of operations and do the x sum first.

This gives us the new expression for the first moment\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \uf8f6\nZ \u03c0\nt\nr2\n\u0001 X\n1\nhxi = \u2212\nMkj \uf8f8 \uf8edr3 \uf8f8\n(43)\ndk 0 0 1 \uf8ed\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0\nr4\nj=1\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\nZ \u03c0\ni r2\n\u0001h\n\u0001\n1\n\u22121\nMk \u2212 Mkt+1 \uf8edr3 \uf8f8 .\n(44)\ndk 0 0 1 (1 \u2212 Mk )\n=\u2212\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0\nr\n4\n\nThe eignevalues of Mk satisfy 0 < |\u03bb| < 1 and then in the long time limit, therefore Mkt+1 \u2192 0 and the first moment\nbecomes approximately\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\nZ \u03c0\ni r2\n\u0001h\n1\n\u22121\nhxi \u2248 \u2212\ndk 0 0 1 (1 \u2212 Mk ) Mk \uf8edr3 \uf8f8\n(45)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0\nr\n4\n\n2\n\n=\n\nr2 Re [\u03ba(t)] \u2212 r3 Im [\u03ba(t)] + r4 |\u03ba(t)|\n.\n\u22121 + |\u03ba(t)|2\n\n(46)\n\nIn the long time limit, the second moment can also be calculated as\n\uf8f9\uf8eb1\uf8f6\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\n1\n\uf8ecr \uf8f7\ndk 1 0 0 0 \uf8f0ZL\nLj\u2212j\n(ZL + ZR ) Ljk \uf8fb \uf8ed 2 \uf8f8\nhx2 i = t \u2212\nk\nr3\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0\nj=1 j \u2032 =1\nr4\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\nZ \u03c0\nj\u22121\nt X\n0\nX\n\u0001\n\u2032\n1\ndk 0 0 1 Mkj\u2212j \uf8ed0\uf8f8\n=t\u2212\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0\n2\nj=1 j \u2032 =1\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n\uf8ee\n\nj\u22121\nt X\nX\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n0\nh\ni\n\u0001\n1\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n=t\u2212\ndk 0 0 1 t \u2212 (1 \u2212 Mk ) Mk + (1 \u2212 Mk ) Mkt (1 \u2212 Mk ) Mk \uf8ed0\uf8f8\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\n2\n2\n2|\u03ba(t)| + 5|\u03ba(t)|\n2|\u03ba(t)|\n+\n,\n=t 1+\n2\n\u22121 + |\u03ba(t)|\n(\u22121 + |\u03ba(t)|2 )2\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nwhich is independent on the initial coin state.\nThe position variance is obtained as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2|\u03ba(t)|2\nr2 Re [\u03ba(t)] \u2212 r3 Im [\u03ba(t)] + r4 |\u03ba(t)|2\n2|\u03ba(t)|4 + 5|\u03ba(t)|2\n2\n2\nvar = hx i \u2212 hxi = t 1 +\n\u2212\n+\n.\n2\n\u22121 + |\u03ba(t)|2\n\u22121 + |\u03ba(t)|2\n(\u22121 + |\u03ba(t)|2 )\n\n(47)\n\n(48)\n\nIn the long time regime, \u03ba(t) (22) tends to zero. Then the position variance is linear dependent on time t. Thus in\nthe case of the non-Markovian dephasing coin the variance grows linearly with time and a QW with a non-Markovian\ndephasing coin shows a diffusive spread in the long time limit.\nIn the long time limit, we can obtain the analytical results of the position variance of a non-Markovian decoherent\nQW. In Fig. 5, we can see that for the first several steps, the numerical and analytical results agree with each other.\nWhereas for long time, the variance becomes linear dependent on time t showing a diffusive spread, just as in the\nclassical case, though the rate of growth will greater than for the RW.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we presented how non-Markovian decoherence can influence the evolution of a quantum walker on a\nline and showed a different behavior compared to the ballistic and diffusive spreads. We analyze the dynamics and\nquantum correlation of quantum walker and his coin. We use the MID and QD as measures for quantum correlations.\nThe QD would be a valuable measure to use and the MID also suffices to show that pure quantum correlation induced\nby having non-Markovian dephasing on the coin state. The memory effect caused by the information flowing back\nto the system during a non-Markovian process decreases the quantum correlation quickly which is later interrupted\n\n\fvar\n\n11\n\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n0\n\n200 400 600 800 1000\nt\n\nFIG. 5: The analytical result on the variance of position distribution for a QW on a line with a non-Markovian dephasing coin\nin the long time regime. Here we choose the parameters g0 = 1 and \u03b7 = 0.01 for calculations.\n\nby revivals. In the long time limit, the quantum correlation disappears with \u03ba(t) tending to zero, which results\nin a transition from a QW with a ballistic scaling to a RW with a diffusive scaling. We draw the conclusions as\nfollowings: in the short time the behavior of QW with non-Markovian dephasing coin oscillates between a ballistic\nand diffusive spreading behavior, and the quantum correlation between the walker and coin collapses and revivals due\nto the memory effect. Whereas in the long time limit, QW with non-Markovian decoherence does not make much\ndifference from that with Markovian decoherence. Thus our analysis is quite valuable in that we characterize this QW\non a line with non-Markovian dephasing coin carefully and devise appropriate, meaningful QD and MID as measures\nto study quantum correlation dynamics for this system.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Barry C.
