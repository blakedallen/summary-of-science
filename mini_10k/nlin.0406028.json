Introduction\nContinuum approach gives many advantages in physics and mechanics of periodic and aperiodic structures with a\ngreat number of structural elements interacting with each other. An important problem of mechanics of generalized\ncontinua is to take into account the most essential information about the microscopic structure of matter.\nThe classical elasticity theory takes into account three degrees of freedom for an infinitesimally small volume, i.e.,\nthree components of displacement vector. However, there are many practically important materials having almost\nrigid atomic clusters with relatively weak interaction between them and one has to consider not only translational but\nalso rotational and perhaps some other degrees of freedom to characterize positions, orientations, and distortions of\nthe particles. Of particular interest are the materials where the framework of rigid clusters is organized in a way that\ntranslational and rotational degrees of freedom are coupled (see, e.g., Fig. 1). Some important classes of such\nmaterials are the polymorphs of silica (SiO2) where the structural units, SiO4 tetrahedra, shear oxygen atoms in their\ncorners and the energy cost of deformation of tetrahedra is much greater than the cost of their mutual rotations. It has\nbeen demonstrated that the rotational degrees of freedom can be responsible for the displacive type of phase\ntransition and incommensurate phase of quartz (Vallade et al., 1992; Wells et al., 2002; Dmitriev et al., 2003a),\nnegative Poisson ratio of cristobalite and quartz (Keskar and Chelikowsky, 1993; Smirnov and Mirgorodsky, 1997;\nKimizuka et al., 2000; Alderson and Evans, 2002), and negative thermal expansion of beta-quarts (Smirnov, 1999).\nSimilar effects can be observed in other materials with microscopic rotations, such as perovskites, SrTiO3, containing\ncorner-linked TiO6 octahedra, KH2PO4 (KDP) family of crystals with comparatively rigid PO4 tetrahedra and others.\nMajor physical effects related to the materials with rotational degrees of freedom can be discussed theoretically in\nframe of the rigid-unit-mode (RUM) model (Swainson and Dove, 1993; Dove et al., 1997; Wells et al., 2002). The\nRUMs are the low-frequency modes in which the clusters can move without distortion. In a real situation, any mode\ncan include components of displacive, rotational and distortive motion, with the relative proportions of the different\ntypes varying more or less continuously from low-frequency modes with little distortive component to high*\n\nCorresponding author.

The origin of auxetic behaviour (i.e., negative\nPoisson ratio) of materials with finite size particles (molecules) has been discussed in frame of 2D models (Vasiliev\net al., 2002; Wojciechowski et al., 2003; Wojciechowski, 2003). Incommensurate structures have been studied in\nframe of 1D and 2D elastically hinged molecule (EHM) models where the mutual rotations of the finite size particles\nare very important and all the phonon modes are of nearly RUM type (Dmitriev et al., 1997, 1998, 2000, 2003b;\nBraun and Kivshar, 2004).\nConstruction of the continuum theories taking into account microscopic rotations dates back to the work by E. and\nF. Cosserat (Cosserat and Cosserat, 1909). Cosserat and micropolar continuum theories, in which the field of\nrotations is incorporated in addition to the displacement fields, have found their applications in many branches of\nphysics and mechanics such as mechanics of granular media (M\u00fchlhaus and Oka, 1996; Suiker et al., 2001),\nstructured materials (Lakes, 1991; Forest et al., 2001), repetitive beam lattice structures (Noor, 1988), physics of\ndielectric crystals (Pouget et al., 1986; Eringen, 1999; Maugin, 1999; Vasiliev et al., 2002), and others. 2D\ncontinuum models for media with microscopic rotations have been developed also in fabric mechanics (Kuwazuru\nand Yoshikawa, 2004a, 2004b).\nAnother idea of generalization of the classical continuum theory is taking into account higher order gradient terms\n(M\u00fchlhaus and Oka, 1996; Fleck and Hutchinson, 1997, 2001; Aifantis, 2003; Peerlings et al., 2001; Askes et al.,\n2002). A beautiful exposition of some other theories of non-classical material continua may be found in the review\nby Rogula (1985).\nIn this paper we construct a multi-field micropolar continuum theory for the 2D model of KDP crystal studied in\nour previous work (Vasiliev et al., 2002). Crystalline solids have translational periodicity and usually the basic idea\nis to start from a primitive (minimum volume) periodic element of the structure, then define the most important\ndegrees of freedom in it, and finally, to formulate a continuum theory in terms of these degrees of freedom under the\nassumption that they vary slowly in space. However, for the oriented media, a strong coupling of long and short\nwaves takes place very often and one may need a theory capable of description of both long and short waves. Such a\ntheory can be constructed considering from more than one primitive translational cells in an extended periodic cell.\nTo construct a N -field continuum theory we consider a macro-cell containing N primitive cells. The number of\ndegrees of freedom in the macro-cell is N times larger than in a primitive cell and consequently, the number of\ncontinuum equations of the multi-field theory is N times larger than that for a conventional theory, which will be\ncalled single-field theory meaning that there is only one field for each component of vector of generalized\ndisplacements. As for the discrete system, consideration of translational cell with more than one primitive cell adds\nno new physical details. However, continuum analogue constructed for an extended periodic cell with a larger\nnumber of fields used to describe each component of displacement gives a possibility to describe the discrete system\nmore accurately (Il'iushina, 1969, 1972; Vasiliev, 1994, 1996).\nThis paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2, the 2D discrete model of KDP crystal with finite size particles is\ndescribed. In Sec. 3 and Sec. 4, we derive the discrete equations of motion for a periodic cell containing two\nparticles; then we derive the corresponding two-field micropolar continuum theory; and, for the sake of comparison,\nobtain the dispersion relations for the discrete model and continuum theories. In Sec. 5, we derive the four-field\nmicropolar theory and corresponding dispersion relations. In Sec. 6, multi-field modelling of localised distortions in\ncrystal is considered. In Sec. 7 we generalize the obtained results and discuss the difference between the highgradient and the multi-field continuum theories. Section 8 concludes the paper.\n2. 2D model of crystal with finite size particles\nWe consider the 2D microscopic model of KDP crystal offered in Ishibashi and Iwata (2000) and Vasiliev et al.\n(2002). The model consists of absolutely rigid elastically bound square particles and each particle experiences the\naction of the rotational background potential (see Fig. 1(a)). The geometry of the model can be described by two\nparameters, the lattice spacing, h , and the parameter\nA=\n\na\n2\n\nsin \u03b1 ,\n\n(1)\n\n2\n\n\fL1\n\nn+2\n\u03c6p\n\nh\n\n\u03c6q\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3j\n\nn+1\na\nn\n\n(u , v )\n\n\u03b1\n\np\n\nri\n\nC2\nn-1\nm\n\nm+1\n\n\u03b3i\n\np\n\nC1\nm-1\n\nL0\n\ni\n\np\n\nj\n\n\u03b3\n\nq\n\nq\n\n\u03b3j\n\nrj\nq\n\ny v\n\n\u03c6\n\nm+2\n\n(a)\n\n(u , v )\n\nu\nx\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1. (a) The 2D microscopic model of a crystal. Absolutely rigid square particles are bound elastically and each particle experiences the action\nof the rotational background potential. The lattice spacing is h , and a , \u03b1 are the size and the orientation angle of particles, respectively. C1 and\n\nC2 are the elastic constants for the corner-to-corner and center-to-center bonds, respectively. (b) Definition of displacements u , v and \u03c6 , and\nnotations used in calculation of the potential energy of the elastic bonds, Eq. (3).\n\nwhere a is the size of particles and \u03b1 is the orientation angle of particles. Elastic bonds with coefficient C1 connect\nthe corners of each particle with the nearest corners of nearest neighbours. Elastic bonds with coefficient C 2 connect\nthe centres of particles with the centres of next-nearest neighbours. Each particle has mass M , moment of inertia I ,\nand experiences the action of the rotational background potential with coefficient c . Particles have three degrees of\nfreedom, two components of displacement vector, u , v , and the angle of rotation \u03c6 .\nIn order to obtain equations of motion for p th particle, the following Lagrangian is constructed,\n\nLp =\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\nMu& 2p + Mv& 2p + I\u03c6& 2p \u2212 \u2211 E ( p ,i )( q , j ) \u2212 c\u03c6 2p + f x u p + f y v p + f \u03c6 \u03c6 p ,\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere u p , v p are the components of displacements of the center gravity of p th particle and \u03c6 p is the angle of\nrotation of this particle; the first three terms give the kinetic energy of the p th particle, the fourth term describes the\npotential energy of eight elastic bonds connecting the i th node of p th particle with the j th node of q th particle,\nthe fifth term is the energy of particle in the background potential, and the last three terms give the work of external\nforce with components f x , f y and external torque f \u03c6 . Note that the external forces were not taken into account\nin Vasiliev et al. (2002).\nPotential energy of the elastic bond connecting the i th node of p th particle with the j th node of q th particle\nis E ( p ,i )(q , j ) = (C / 2 )(L1 \u2212 L0 )2 , where C is the bond stiffness, L0 and L1 are the bond lengths before and after\ndeformation, respectively. We linearise the change in the bond length, \u2206L = L1 \u2212 L0 , with respect to displacements\nand rotations assuming that they are small and represent the potential energy in the form\nE( p ,i )(q , j ) =\n\n[(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n1\nC uq \u2212 u p cos \u03b3 + vq \u2212 v p sin \u03b3 + ri\u03c6 p sin (\u03b3 i \u2212 \u03b3 ) \u2212 r j\u03c6 q sin \u03b3 j \u2212 \u03b3\n2\n\n) ]2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere C = C1 or C = C 2 for corner-to-corner and for center-to-center bonds, respectively, and parameters ri ,\n\nrj ,\u03b3 , \u03b3 i , \u03b3\n\nj\n\nare related to the undeformed geometry (see Fig. 1(b)). Particularly, ri = r j = a\n\n2 and ri = r j = 0\n\nfor corner-to-corner and center-to-center bonds, respectively; \u03b3 i is the angle between x -axis and the radius vector\n3\n\n\fconnecting the center of mass of p th particle with its i th node; \u03b3 is the angle between x -axis and the direction\nfrom the node i to the node j . Parameters \u03b3 i , \u03b3 j and \u03b3 can take values l\u03c0 2 \u00b1 \u03b1 and l\u03c0 4 , respectively, with an\ninteger l .\n\n3. Discrete model with two particles in a periodic cell\nIn Vasiliev et al. (2002), we used a unit cell with one particle, (m, n ) , to write down the three discrete equations of\nmotion and to derive a single-field continuum theory from the discrete equations.\nHere we use a cell containing two particles with coordinates (m, n ) and (m + 1, n ) respectively (Fig. 1). In the\npresent case, each particle has subscript index s which is 0 if the sum m + n is even and it is 1 if the sum is odd.\nThere are six degrees of freedom per unit cell, u s , v s , \u03c6 s , s = 0, 1 . We also use this subscript index for forces and\ntorques applied to the particles.\nFor the two particles in a periodic cell we construct the Lagrangian Eq.

Substitutions K x \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K y and K y \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K x in the coefficients a1,m given by Eq. (10) lead to the same\ndeterminant for dispersion relations as for the coefficients a 0,m given by Eq. (9). Thus, the dispersion relations\nderived for two particles in a periodic cell define six surfaces in the reduced first Brillouin zone, K x + K y < \u03c0 .\nThree of them, having coefficients a 0,m , coincide with the surfaces for discrete model with one particle in a periodic\ncell derived in Vasiliev et al.

Three other, having coefficients a1, m , are the same surfaces folded with respect\nto the four planes K x \u00b1 K y = \u00b1\u03c0 from the region K x + K y > \u03c0 , K x < \u03c0 , K y < \u03c0 .\n\n4. Two-field theory\nWe introduce two vector-functions {u s (x, y, t ), v s (x, y, t ), \u03c6 s (x, y, t )} , s = 0, 1 , in order to describe the\ndisplacements of the particles marked by the indices 0 and 1.\nWe assume that u sm,n (t ), v sm,n (t ), \u03c6 sm, n (t ) = { u s (x, y, t ), v s ( x, y, t ), \u03c6 s (x, y, t ) } x = mh, y = nh , s = 0, 1.\n\n{\n\n}\n\nSubstituting in Eq.

Assuming that the displacement in\nthe discrete model vary slowly from one macro-cell to another and using the Taylor series expansions, Eq.(11), for\nfield functions up to second order terms, we come to the six equations of the two-field long-wave theory.

The two-field theory gives the largest error\nnear the points (\u00b1\u03c0 , 0) and (0, \u00b1 \u03c0 ) of the original first Brillouin zone. In Sec. 5 we derive the four-field theory\nwhich improves the description of the vibration spectrum in the vicinity of these points.\n\n5. Four-field theory\nWe consider the periodic cell containing four particles with coordinates (m, n ) , (m + 1, n ) , (m + 1, n + 1) ,\n(m, n + 1) (Fig. 1(a)).

(4):\nMu&&m = (C 2 + C1 )(u m +1 \u2212 2u m + u m \u22121 ) + AC1 (\u03c6 m +1 \u2212 \u03c6 m \u22121 ) ,\n\nI\u03c6&&m = \u2212 AC1 (u m +1 \u2212 u m \u22121 ) \u2212 A 2 C1 (\u03c6 m +1 + 6\u03c6 m + \u03c6 m \u22121 ) \u2212 c\u03c6 m .\n\n(26)\n\nWith the use of the static solution to Eq. (26) one can write the solution in terms of variables Eq. (25) for even n\nin the form\nu sm = \u03b1 0 + mh\u03b1 1 + (\u2212 1) s e \u2212\u03bbmh\u03b1 2 + (\u2212 1) s e \u03bbmh\u03b1 3 ,\n\n\u03c6 sm = (\u2212 1)s r1\u03b1 1 + r2 e \u2212\u03bbmh\u03b1 2 \u2212 r2 e \u03bbmh\u03b1 3 ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere s = 0, 1 , and\n\n8\n\n\fr1 = \u2212\n\n2 AC1 h\n8 A 2 C1 + c\n\n, r2 =\n\nC1 + C 2 2[1 + cosh (\u03bbh )]\n.\nAC1\n2 sinh (\u03bbh )\n\n(28)\n\nThe inverse width of the localized distortion, \u03bb > 0 , is defined in terms of the model parameters as\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4 sinh 2 (\u03bbh ) = (1 + C1 / C 2 ) 4 + c / C1 A 2 ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhich is obtained from the characteristic equations for Eq.

(27) must be chosen to satisfy boundary conditions.\n\nFor example, for the crystal layer, 0 < m < N , solution to Eq. (27) satisfying the boundary conditions\nu 00 = 0 , \u03c6 00 = 0 , u1N = u N , \u03c61N = 0 ,\n\n(31)\n\nhas the form\n\n[\n= [(\u2212 1)\n\n]\n\nu sm = 1 + r2 mh / r1 \u2212 (\u2212 1)s e \u2212 \u03bbmh \u2212 (\u2212 1) s e \u2212\u03bb ( N \u2212 m )h pu N ,\n\n\u03c6 sm\n\ns\n\n\u2212e\n\n\u2212 \u03bbmh\n\n+e\n\n\u2212 \u03bb ( N \u2212 m )h\n\n]r pu\n2\n\nN\n\n(32)\n\n,\n\nwhere p = 1 (2 + r2 Nh / r1 ) . For sake of simplicity we have assumed that N is sufficiently large so that the\ndistortions introduced by the boundary conditions at m = 0 and m = N do not overlap and we have neglected the\nterm e \u2212 \u03bbNh in comparison with 1 in Eq. (32).\nLet us now apply the multi-field approach to solve the above problem. We simplify the four-field theory\nEqs. (14), (15), (21) and (22) applying the assumptions Eq. (25) which, in view of Eqs. (19) and (20), suggest that\nthe fields U s (x, y ) , V s ( x, y ) , \u03a6 s (x, y ) are zero for s = 1 and s = 3 .\nWe start from the single-field theory Eq. (14) which in the one-dimensional case considered here obtains the form\nMU 0,tt = (C1 + C 2 )h 2U 0, xx \u2212 2 AC1 h\u03a6 0, x ,\n\n(\n\n)\n\nI\u03a6 0,tt = 2 AC1 hU 0, x \u2212 A 2 C1 h 2 \u03a6 0, xx + 8\u03a6 0 \u2212 c\u03a6 0 .\n\n(33)\n\nCharacteristic polynomial for the static problem defined by Eq. (33) has a second-order root equal to zero.\nCorresponding static solution has the form\nU 0 (x ) = \u03b1 0 + \u03b1 1 x ,\n\u03a6 0 (x ) = \u2212 R1\u03b1 1 ,\n\n(34)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nwhere R1 = \u22122 AC1 h / 8 A 2 C1 + c , and \u03b1 0 , \u03b1 1 are arbitrary constants.\nNote that the two other roots of the characteristic polynomial of Eq. (33) are purely imaginary and hence, the\ngeneral solution Eq. (33) corresponding to the single-field theory does not contain exponentially decaying terms\ndescribing the localized distortions.\nExponential part of the solution Eq. (27) can be obtained from Eq. (21) of the four-field theory which, after the\nreduction to one-dimension, obtains the following form\n\n(\n\n)\n\nMU 2,tt = \u2212(C 2 + C1 ) h 2U 2, xx + 4U 2 \u2212 2 AC1 h\u03a6 2, x ,\n\n(\n\n)\n\nI\u03a6 2,tt = 2 AC1 hU 2, x + A 2 C1 h 2 \u03a6 2, xx \u2212 4\u03a6 2 \u2212 c\u03a6 2 .\n\n(35)\n\nEquation (35) has the static solution\nU 2 (x ) = \u2212e \u2212 \u039bx \u03b1 2 \u2212 e \u039bx\u03b1 3 ,\n\n\u03a6 2 ( x ) = \u2212 R 2 e \u2212 \u039bx \u03b1 2 + R 2 e \u039bx \u03b1 3 ,\n\n(36)\n\n9\n\n\fwhere\nR2 =\n\nC1 + C 2 4 + (\u039bh )2\n.\nAC1\n2 \u039bh\n\n(37)\n\nThe inverse width of the distortion, \u039b > 0 , can be obtained from the characteristic polynomial\n\n[\n\n\uf8ee(C + C 2 )(\u039bh )2 + 4\ndet \uf8ef 1\n2 AC1 \u039bh\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n\n]\n\n\uf8f9\n2 AC1 \u039bh\n\uf8fa = 0.\n2\nA 2 C1 (\u039bh ) \u2212 4 \u2212 c \uf8fb\uf8fa\n\n[\n\n]\n\n(38)\n\nWith the use of the solutions Eqs. (34), (36) and the following relations\nu s (x ) = U 0 ( x ) \u2212 (\u2212 1) s U 1 (x ) ,\n\n\u03c6 s (x ) = \u2212(\u2212 1)s \u03a6 0 (x ) \u2212 \u03a6 1 (x ) ,\n\n(39)\n\nwe express the solution in terms of the original variables:\nu s (x ) = \u03b1 0 + \u03b1 1 x + (\u2212 1) s e \u2212 \u039bx\u03b1 2 + (\u2212 1) s e \u039bx\u03b1 3 ,\n\n\u03c6 s (x ) = (\u2212 1)s R1\u03b1 1 + R 2 e \u2212 \u039bx\u03b1 2 \u2212 R 2 e \u039bx\u03b1 3 .\n\n(40)\n\nArbitrary constants \u03b1 j , j = 0,...,3 , in Eq. (40) are to be found from the boundary conditions. Analog of the\nboundary conditions Eq. (31) is\nu 0 (0 ) = 0 , \u03c6 0 (0 ) = 0 , u1 (L ) = u N , \u03c6 1 (L ) = 0 ,\n\nand corresponding solution has the form\n\n[\n\u03c6 (x ) = [(\u2212 1)\n\n(41)\n\n]\n\nu s (x ) = 1 + R 2 x / R1 \u2212 (\u2212 1) s e \u2212 \u039bx \u2212 (\u2212 1) s e \u2212 \u039b ( L \u2212 x ) Pu N ,\ns\n\ns\n\n\u2212e\n\n\u2212 \u039bx\n\n+e\n\n\u2212 \u039b (L \u2212 x )\n\n]R P u\n2\n\nN\n\n,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere P = 1 / (2 + R 2 L / R1 ) .\nNote that the exact solutions Eq. (27) for the discrete system and corresponding multi-field solution, Eq. (40),\nhave similar structures. Equation (38) for the parameter \u039b of multi-field theory can be obtained from Eq. (30) for\nthe corresponding parameter \u03bb expanding the hyperbolic functions in Taylor series up to second order terms. The\nformulae for parameters R1 , R2 , P of approximate continuum solution can also be obtained by Taylor expansion of\nthe hyperbolic functions in the formulae for corresponding parameters r1 , r2 , p in the discrete solution. The\ndifferences between the hyperbolic functions and corresponding Taylor series expansions up to second order around\nthe zero point define the accuracy of the continuum solutions.\nFurther analysis and comparison of the discrete model Eq. (26) with the multi-field model Eqs. (33), (35) will be\ncarried out with respect to the dynamical solutions of the form\nu m (t ) = u~ exp[i\u03c9t \u2212 mK ] ,\n\u03c6 (t ) = \u03c6~ exp[i\u03c9t \u2212 mK ] ,\n(43)\nm\n\nfor the discrete system and of the form\nU s ( x, t ) = u~s exp[i\u03c9t \u2212 Kx / h] ,\n\u03a6 (x, t ) = \u03c6~ exp[i\u03c9t \u2212 Kx / h] ,\ns\n\ns\n\n(44)\n\nfor the multi-field continuum, where K is a complex parameter.\n\n10\n\n\f\u03c9\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\u03c9\n\n8\n\n3\n\n6\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\nRe K\n\u03bb \u039b\n\n\u03c0 2\n\n\u03c0 Im K\n\n4 5\n3\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n\u03c0 /2\n\n\u039b Re K\n14\n4 6 8 10 12\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03c0\n\nIm K\n\nFig.2. Relations between \u03c9 and Re K , Im K for the solutions of the form Eq.(43) and Eq. (44). Solid lines show the exact dispersion curves for\nthe discrete model. The dispersion curves for the multi-field theory are presented by dashed lines. Dots on the \u03c9 = 0 plane show the roots of\ncharacteristic equations for static problem. In (a) and (b) we contrast the results obtained for comparatively weak and rather strong rotational\nbackground potential setting \u0441 = 4 and \u0441 = 40 , respectively. Other parameters are C1 = 1 , C2 = 2 , A = 0.5 , h = 1 , M = 1 , I = 1 .\n\nSubstituting Eq. (43) and (44) into corresponding equations of motion we obtain the relations between \u03c9 and\nRe K , Im K . We compare these relations for the discrete model and multi-field theory in Fig. 2. Without the loss in\ngenerality, one can fix, for example, C1 , h , and M . Then we introduce the dimensionless quantities u m = u m / h ,\nt = t / C1 / M , x = x / h , set C2 = 2C1 , A = 0.5h , I = Mh 2 , and, as in Vasiliev et al. (2002), consider two different\n\nmagnitudes of rotational background potential, c = 4h 2C1 and c = 40h 2C1 , in Fig.2(a) and Fig. 2(b), respectively.\nCurves for the discrete system are shown by solid lines and for multi-field theory by dashed lines. The roots of\ncharacteristic equations in static case, i.e., in the \u03c9 = 0 plane, are depicted by dots. K = 0 is a second-order root\nfor both discrete model and continuum theory. Two other roots differ noticeably for discrete system and multi-field\ntheory, but qualitatively they belong to similar branches in the plane Im K = \u03c0 . Solid and dashed curves are tangent\nat the point K = (\u03c0 , 0) . The difference is small for K near this point and increases with the distance from it.\nDifference in the curves for the discrete and continuum theories is rather large in the static case (\u03c9 = 0) at the\nconsidered set of parameters. This can be explained by the very sharp localization of the distortion in our examples.\nHowever, even for such a sharp localization which cannot be accurately captured by a long-wave continuum theory\nwe have obtained a very good qualitative agreement between discrete and multi-field theories because the multi-field\ntheory contains short-wave decaying solution which does not exist in the single-field theory. As it can be seen from\nEq. (29), the width of the localized distortion can be very large if at least one of the model parameters, C1 , C 2 , or c ,\ncan obtain negative values. In this case, the multi-field theory will give not only qualitative but also quantitative\nsolutions.\nAs an illustration, in Fig. 3 we present the values \u03c6 sm = \u03c6 sm / r2 pu N given by Eq. (32) by dots and plot the\ndashed zigzag line to show the short-wave character of the solution. Two solid lines show the two-field solution\n\u03c6 s (x ) = \u03c6 s (x ) / r2 pu N , Eq. (42), which approximately describes the rapidly oscillating solution in the discrete\n\nsystem, one solid line for the points 2mh and another one for the points (2m + 1)h . Near the points m = 0 and\n\nm = N , the zigzag solution (\u2212 1)s r2 pu N is corrected by the localised solutions in order to satisfy the boundary\nconditions.\n\n11\n\n\f\u03c6 sm \u03c6 s ( x )\n\n\u03c61 ( x )\n\n1\n\nm\nx\n-1\n\n\u03c6 0 (x )\n\nFig. 3. Comparison of the rotational displacements for the boundary-value problem considered in Sec. 6. Dots show the exact solution for the\ndiscrete model, \u03c6 sm , defined by Eq. (32). The dashed zigzag line is plotted to illustrate the short-wave character of the solution. Two smooth\n\nfunctions, \u03c6 0 (x ) and \u03c61 (x ) , represent the multi-field solution, Eq. (42), for odd and even particles, respectively. Parameters of the model are set\nas in Fig. 2a.\n\nMulti-field solution Eq. (32) describes not only slowly varying displacements u ms in the discrete system (the first\ntwo terms in the first equations of Eq. (32)) but also the short-wave spatially localized displacements (the third and\nfourth terms). The latter are not reproduced by the single-field micropolar model Eqs. (14), (33).\n7. Discussion\n\nIn this work, for the 2D discrete model with finite size particles, we have constructed two- and four-field\ncontinuum theories. Standard single-field continuum theory derived in Vasiliev et al. (2002) was valid only for wave\nnumbers close to the origin of the first Brillouin zone while the two-field theory improves the approximation of the\ndiscrete spectrum for the short waves near the points (\u00b1\u03c0 , \u00b1 \u03c0 ) and the four-field theory gives an additional\nimprovement near the points (\u00b1\u03c0 , 0) and (0, \u00b1 \u03c0 ) . Consideration of a periodic cell containing several primitive cells\nleads to the reduction of area of the first Brillouin zone and folding of the dispersion surfaces of discrete system. For\ntwo particles in a periodic cell the folding occurs with respect to planes K x \u00b1 K y = \u00b1\u03c0 and points\n\n(K x , K y ) = (\u00b1 \u03c0 , \u00b1 \u03c0 )\n\nbecome (0, 0) point in the new reciprocal basis. The two-field theory is accurate at these\n\npoints. Dispersion surfaces for the cell with four particles can be obtained by folding the original dispersion surfaces\nwith respect to K x = \u00b1\u03c0 2 and K y = \u00b1\u03c0 2 . As a result of folding, points K x , K y = (\u00b1 \u03c0 , \u00b1 \u03c0 ) , and also\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(K x , K y ) = (0, \u00b1 \u03c0 ) , and (K x , K y ) = (\u00b1 \u03c0 , 0) become (0, 0) points and the four-field continuum theory is valid for\n\nshort waves in the vicinity of these points.\nGenerally speaking, the N -field theory is constructed as a continuum analogue for the discrete system with a\nperiodic cell containing N primitive cells. Consideration of more than one primitive cell in a periodic cell is\nmeaningless for a discrete periodic system because the dispersion surfaces in this case are just the original dispersion\nsurfaces N times folded in the N times reduced first Brillouin zone. The number of equations of motion increases\nby N times but they do not contain any new information. However, the N -field continuum theory derived for a\nperiodic cell with N primitive cells gives a piecewise approximation to the exact dispersion surface and the number\nof pieces is equal to N . Each piece approximates the exact dispersion surface in the vicinity of point\nK x , K y = (0, 0) of the reduced reciprocal basis. Thus, the N -field theory gives a good approximation of dispersion\n\n(\n\n)\n\nsurfaces not only for long waves but also for short waves and, in the case of multiple folding, for the waves inside\nthe first Brillouin zone.\nIn Fig. 4 we compare the exact dispersion curves of the discrete model (solid lines) with the single-field\ncontinuum theory derived in Vasiliev et al. (2002) (dotted lines) and its two different generalizations, namely, the\nhigh-gradient (dashed lines in (a)) and the multi-field (dashed lines in (b)) theories. The single-field theory gives a\ngood approximation only near the origin of the first Brillouin zone. The high-gradient theory (fourth order terms\n\n12\n\n\fretained in Taylor expansions) extends the region of validity of the long-wave theory but gives no improvement near\nthe zone boundary, K x = \u03c0 . In (b), the three branches of the dispersion curves for the four-field continuum theory,\nEqs. (14), (21), are shown unfolded. Near the origin the multi-field theory gives the accuracy of the single-field\ntheory (second order). The four-field theory also gives a good approximation near the zone boundary, and it is exact\nat the point K x = \u03c0 , where the single-field and the high-gradient theories give maximum error. Thus, the highgradient and the multi-field approaches improve the long-wave single-field theory in different ways. Taking into\naccount the higher order terms in the Taylor series expansions Eq. (11) the high-gradient multi-field theories can be\nconstructed so that one can combine the advantages of both theories.\nThe present study is based on the assumption of rigid finite size particles, which is often used in the solid state\nphysics and materials science (Grima and Evans, 2000; Ishibashi and Iwata, 2000; Swainson and Dove, 1993; Dove\net al., 1997; Wells et al., 2002; Dmitriev et al., 1997, 1998, 2000, 2003b; Vasiliev et al., 2002). If necessary, the\nmodel can be generalized for the case of deformable particles taking into account additional degrees of freedom.\nSince the multi-field theory is valid for both long and short waves, it is an appropriate theory to describe the\ncoupling between them. The physical situation where short and long waves are strongly coupled can be easily\nrealized in periodic systems (some natural crystals or manmade structures) having comparatively rigid finite size\nparticles with rotational degrees of freedom. This can be intuitively understood, for example, by inspection of the\nstructure presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen that a homogeneous deformation, e.g., uniaxial or hydrostatic\ncompression, results in staggered rotations of particles. Such coupling of long and short waves usually does not take\nplace for materials consisting of pointwise particles or for materials having finite size particles linked such that the\nmutual rotations are suppressed or they are not of a staggered type in response to a homogeneous strain. For the\nmaterials of these kinds the use of well developed classical or single-field micropolar theories can be sufficient.\nHowever, when short and long waves are strongly coupled the use of a multi-field theory can be indispensable. Some\nof the crystalline materials having finite size particles with rotational degrees of freedom, for which the coupling\nbetween long and short waves can be important, we would like to mention the ones described in the Introduction,\ni.e., polymorphs of silica (SiO2), KH2PO4 (KDP) family of crystals, some perovskites, e.g., SrTiO3. It has been also\nproved that microscopic rotations can be responsible for the negative Poisson ratio exhibited by some natural and\nmanmade auxetic materials (Grima and Evans, 2000; Ishibashi and Iwata, 2000; Vasiliev et al., 2002;\nWojciechowski et. al., 2003; Wojciechowski 2003).\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03c9\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n\u03c0 /2\n\n\u03c0\n\nKx\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0 /2\n\n\u03c0\n\nKx\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 4. Comparison of the exact dispersion surfaces for the discrete model (solid lines) with that for different continuum theories (section\nK y = 0 ). Dispersion relations of the long-wave approximation (single-field theory) derived in Vasiliev et al. (2002) are plotted in (a) and (b) by\ndotted lines. Dashed lines show (a) the single-field high-gradient theory (fourth order terms retained in Taylor expansions) and (b) the four-field\ncontinuum theory. Parameters of the model are set as in Fig. 2a.\n\n13\n\n\fIt is important to note that the multi-field approach gives a natural way of incorporating the short-wave external\nfields of forces and torques into a continuum theory. For example, for the model studied in this paper, the short-wave\n\nexternal force (or torque) of the form (\u2212 1)m + n f , transforms to a smooth field of forces, F0 = 0 , F1 = \u2212 f , F2 = 0 ,\nF3 = 0 (or torques, F0 = \u2212 f , F1 = 0 , F2 = 0 , F3 = 0 ), and they can be taken into account in frame of the fourfield continuum theory, Eqs. (14), (15), (21), (22).\n8. Conclusions\n\nFor the 2D discrete model of KDP crystal we have derived the two- and four-field micropolar continuum theories.\nThe N -field theory is obtained as a continuum analogue for the discrete model with a periodic cell containing N\nprimitive cells by using N vector fields to describe deformation of the crystal. This approach gives the possibility to\nconstruct a hierarchy of theories with increasing complexity and accuracy.\nComparison of the dispersion relations for the multi-field and the high-gradient theories suggests that the latter\nimproves the classical long-wave theory in the vicinity of small wave numbers while the former near the zone\nboundaries and, if desired, inside the first Brillouin zone. We have shown that the multi-field approach makes it\npossible to describe the localised structural distortions rapidly oscillating in space.\nThe use of several fields describing external forces and/or torques makes it possible to construct a continuum\ntheory taking into account the external fields rapidly changing in space.\nSince the multi-field theory is valid for both long and short waves, it is an appropriate theory to describe the\ncoupling between them, mode softening, and other related phenomena for the crystals with the rotational degrees of\nfreedom. The multi-field theory can be also useful in the rapidly developing theory of the lattice instability (VanVliet\net al., 2003; Dmitriev et al., 2004a, 2004b), particularly in the study of the post-critical behaviour for the instability\nwith the mode softening inside the first Brillouin zone (modulated and incommensurate phase). One example of the\nsuccessful use of multi-field approach can be found in Dmitriev et al. (1997) where the domain-wall regime of\nincommensurate phase has been described.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAuthors are grateful to Y. Ishibashi, T. Shigenari, and K. W.
