The interest to study\nspin accumulation, one of the key elements in spintronic\napplications [1], is not limited to novel spin-based devices. Spin injection can also be used as a sensitive\nspectroscopic tool to study fundamental properties such\nas the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors [2, 3], Skyrmion excitations in the quantum Hall\nregime [4, 5], and spin-charge separation in non-Fermi liquids [6, 7]. While spin accumulation in metals was first\ndemonstrated by Johnson and Silsbee [8], the basis for\nunderstanding spin injection and, more generally, spinpolarized transport, dates back to Mott [9]. He noted\nthat the electrical current in ferromagnets could be expressed as the sum of two independent and unequal parts\nfor two different spin projections implying that the current is spin-polarized. This concept of a \"two-current\nmodel\" together with the spin-dependent scattering at\nthe magnetic interfaces has been successfully used to\nexplain giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and tunnelling\nmagnetoresistance (TMR), key elements in applications\nsuch as magnetic hard drives and nonvolatile magnetic\nrandom access memory (MRAM) [10, 11].\nA conventional picture for spin injection across the ferromagnet/nonmagnetic metal (F/N ) interfaces [12, 13,\n14] is provided by noting that, in each metal, the spinflip scattering is typically much weaker than the momentum scattering. This leads to a mean free path (MFP)\nl which is much shorter than the spin diffusion length\n(SDL) \u03bb\u2013the characteristic scale for the decay of spin\naccumulation at each side of the interface. Within the\ntwo-current model one can then define local spin-resolved\nelectrochemical potentials \u03bc\u03c3 , \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 for carriers with\nmajority and minority spin (with magnetic moment parallel and antiparallel to the magnetization M in a ferro-\n\n\u2217 sgarzon@physics.sc.edu\n\u2020 zutic@dave.nrl.navy.mil\n\nmagnet). In the steady state an electrical current driven\nacross a F/N junction will lead to spin accumulation\n\u221d (\u03bc\u2191 \u2212 \u03bc\u2193 ) which is the balance between spins added\nby the magnetization current and spins removed by spin\nrelaxation. In the absence of interfacial spin-flip scattering, the spin-resolved current I\u03c3 is conserved across the\ninterface [13, 14], and the contact resistance for each spin\ncan be expressed as\nN\nR\u03c3 = (\u03bcF\n\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bc\u03c3 )/eI\u03c3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the indices F, N label the quantities in the corresponding region at each side of the contact and e is\nthe proton charge. R\u2191 6= R\u2193 can be inferred from the\neffect of exchange splitting in the F region, leading to\nspin-dependent Fermi wave vectors, transmission coefficients, and density of states. Spin accumulation in the\nN region can act as a source of spin electromotive force\nwhich produces a voltage V \u221d (\u03bc\u2191 \u2212 \u03bc\u2193 ) measurable by\nadding another ferromagnet [15].\nUsing the F1 /N/F2 geometry depicted in Fig. 1(a) in\nwhich F1 represents the spin injector and F2 the spin\ndetector, we performed nonlocal measurements of spin\ninjection over a wide temperature range.

Detector \u03bc\u03c3 for parallel\n(solid) and antiparallel (dashed) magnetizations is shown.\n\n\fcal voltage VN L is measured between the leads T2 and\nN2 which, in the absence of nonequilibrium spin, is an\nequipotential region without a charge current flow such\nthat VN L = 0. As compared to local measurements (current driven between T1 and T2 and voltage measured between N1 and N2 ), the nonlocal measurement has been\nshown to simplify the extraction of spurious effects (for\nexample, anisotropic magnetoresistance and the Hall effect) from those intrinsic to spin injection [8, 16]. In\nFig. 1(b) we sketch a spatial profile of \u03bc\u03c3 where the presence of interfacial scattering leads to the discontinuity of\nthe electrochemical potential \u03bc = (\u03bc\u2191 + \u03bc\u2193 )/2 at each\ncontact [13, 14, 17].\nFor Fi /Ni , i = 1, 2 tunnel contacts (with resistance\nmuch larger than the characteristic values of the products\n\u03c1N \u03bbN /AN and \u03c1F \u03bbF /AF with \u03c1 the bulk resistivity and\nA the cross-sectional area) conventional analysis gives a\nsimple expression for the nonlocal resistance [12, 14, 16]\nRN L =\n\nVT2 \u2212N2\n\u03c1N \u03bbN exp(\u2212L/\u03bbN )\nP1 P2 ,\n=\u00b1\nIT1 \u2212N1\n2AN\n\n(3)\n\nPrevious analysis of experimental data on spin injection in metallic systems has only considered the spin\u2191\u2191\n\u2191\u2193\nvalve effect due to the difference RN\nL -RN L between the\nnonlocal resistances for \u2191\u2191 and \u2191\u2193 orientation of magnetizations in F1 and F2 [8, 16, 20, 21]. This approach was\nbased on the understanding provided by either Eq. (2) or\nfrom a more general expression [14], not limited to the\nregime of tunnel contacts, which shows that the symmet\u2191\u2191\n\u2191\u2193\nric combination RN\nL +RN L vanishes identically.\nIn contrast, our findings suggest that both the symmetric and the antisymmetric combination of RN L\n\u2191\u2191\n\u2191\u2193\nRS,A = (RN\nL \u00b1 RN L )/2,\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\u2212 300\n\n\u2212 200\n\n\u2212 100\n\n0\nB|| (mT)\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nFIG. 2: RNL as a function of parallel field at 4.2 K for an\ninjector-detector separation of 430 nm.

Our measurements of RS show that the usual assumption of R\u03c3 being\nequal for \u2191\u2191 and \u2191\u2193 orientation does not hold.\nOur samples are electron beam defined F/N/F structures with Co-Al2 O3 -Cu F/N tunnel contacts as shown\nin Fig. 1(a). 36 nm of Co was thermally evaporated to\nform the magnetic injector and detector. An Ar ion-mill\nwas used to clean the magnetic contacts before the 2 nm\nAl insulating level was thermally evaporated and oxidized\nfor 4 minutes at pressures between 150 mTorr and 515\nmTorr to obtain different contact resistances. Finally 54\nnm of Cu was thermally evaporated to complete the F/N\ncontacts. The width of the Cu line was 100 nm while the\n\ninjector and detector were 105 nm by 2.4 \u03bcm and 95 nm\nby 4.5 \u03bcm respectively to ensure different coercivities allowing individual manipulation of their magnetization.\nThe devices were measured at 4.2 K and between 77 K\nand room temperature [22]. Typical values of the SDL\nof Cu and Co are much larger than the MFP, so the\nmacroscopic diffusion equations are valid [14]. The contact resistance of both magnetic contacts was measured\nat 4.2 K and at room temperature, and found to be nearly\ntemperature independent and between 9 \u03a9 and 1 k\u03a9, depending on the oxidation parameters, so the approximation Ri >> \u03c1\u03bb/A is valid for the F and N regions.\nAC currents between 10 \u03bcA and 50 \u03bcA were injected\nfrom T1 to N1 , see Fig. 1(a). Both the nonlocal voltage between T2 and N2 , and the voltage at a 100 k\u03a9\nbias resistor were measured using lock-in amplifiers at 11\nHz. First RN L was measured at 4.2 K as the magnetic\nfield parallel to the injector and detector (Bk ) was cycled between \u2212300 mT and 300 mT at 0.0003 Hz. We\nobserved the characteristic switching of the nonlocal resistance whenever the magnetic contacts became parallel or antiparallel [Fig. 2, Eq. (2)]. The magnitude of\nRN L for \u2191\u2191 and \u2191\u2193 magnetic contacts is almost the same,\n\u2191\u2191\n\u2191\u2193\n|RN\nL | \u2248 |RN L | so at low temperatures RS vanishes.\nHanle effect measurements [1] were performed to determine the degree of spin polarization and the spin diffusion length \u03bbN of electrons in Cu. The magnetic contacts\nwere aligned by applying Bk . After Bk was turned off, an\nout-of-plane magnetic field B\u22a5 was applied to induce spin\nprecession as the electrons diffused\nfrom F1 to F2 with\n\u221a\na time distribution P (t) = 1/ 4\u03c0Dt exp(\u2212L2 /4Dt). Increasing |B\u22a5 | also increases the precession angle of the\nelectron spin making its projection onto M of F2 smaller,\n\u2191\u2191\nhence decreasing RN\nL . Diffusive motion of the electrons\nleads to a broad distribution of transport times and precession angles so a weighted average of the right hand side\nof Eq. (2) must be used.

The measured Hanle effect signal is weakly asymmetric (inset of\nFig. 2) possibly because the two magnetic contacts were\nnot perfectly parallel, or because the applied field had\nsome nonzero in-plane component. Similar data was obtained for the case of antiparallel injector and detector.\nBy fitting the Hanle effect data to Eq. (5) we found that\nthe spin diffusion length was 546 nm and the product of\nthe\n\u221a spin polarizations of the two magnetic contacts was\nP1 P2 = 5.5%. The value of the SDL is comparable to\nthe values measured using GMR [23] (450 nm) and transparent F/N/F spin valves [20] (1000 nm). The values of\nthe spin polarization are also in agreement with those\nmeasured using F/N/F spin valves [16].\nWe measured RN L (T ) for 100K<T<300K and observed a temperature dependent asymmetry between\n\u2191\u2191\n\u2191\u2193\nRN\nL and RN L as shown in Fig. 3(a). Our data shows\nthat RS = 0 only at low temperatures but at room\ntemperature RS is three times larger than the low temperature value of RN L . The temperature dependence\nof RS and RA is shown in Fig. 4(a) to illustrate that\nRA decreases linearly in this temperature range while\nthe increase in RS is nonlinear. This provides some evidence of the possibly different origin of RA , which is\nmagnetization-dependent, and RS , which is independent\nof the relative magnetization of injector and detector.\nWe see the expected [16, 20] trend of decreasing RA as\nthe temperature increases due to the increase in spin\nscattering in Cu and the reduction of the magnetization of Co due to magnons. For comparison we also\nmeasured \u03c1(T ) of Co and Cu, which increased linearly\nfor 100K<T<300K [Figs. 3(b),(c)], while RN L increased\nnonlinearly in that range [Fig. 3(a)]. Since P1 should not\n\nFIG. 4: Temperature dependence of the symmetric and antisymmetric components of (a) RNL , and (b) P2 together with\nthe fits from the proposed model.\n\nchange when M of the detector is reversed, the origin\nof RS can be traced to the difference in P2 between \u2191\u2191\nand \u2191\u2193 configurations [see Eq. (2)]. Hence the quantities\nPS,A = (P2\u2191\u2191 \u00b1P2\u2191\u2193 )/2 contain the relevant information of\nthe spin transport across the N/F2 interface. From previous studies [24] PA should have the same temperature\ndependence as the magnetization, P (T ) = P0 (1 \u2212 \u03b7T 3/2 ).\nSince the momentum relaxation time \u03c4p \u221d \u03c4 (the spin relaxation time) where \u03c4p /\u03c4 = ap [1], we can use Fig. 3(c)\nto evaluate \u03bbN (T ). This, together with P (T ) and the\nmeasured value of the spin polarization from Hanle effect\n(P0 = 5.5%), can be used to fit RA with Eqs. (2) and (4).\nFigure 4(b) shows the obtained PA together with a fit to\nP (T ) with \u03b7 = 8.4 \u00d7 10\u22125K\u22123/2 and ap = 6.6 \u00d7 10\u22124. As\nexpected from the interface effects \u03b7 is larger than the\nbulk value [24] and ap agrees very well with the previously\nmeasured value [20]. With the same two fitting parameters it is possible to extract the temperature dependence\nof PS from the measured RS , as shown in Fig. 4(b), which\ncan be fit well by a Fermi function that describes thermal activation with a characteristic temperature of 1227\nK. The measured offset RS can be modelled by assuming that the spin-dependent contact resistances depend\non the relative alignment of the nonequilibrium magnetization in the normal metal and the magnetization in the\nferromagnetic contact, so there are four independent contact resistances that describe the transport across each\ninterface. This was shown to be possible in semiconductors due to nonlinear effects but the argument is not valid\nin metals [25]. The most likely explanation for RS 6= 0 is\nthe existence of increasing spin-dependent scattering at\nthe detector interface with temperature. In contrast with\nTMR, where the same charge current travels through injector and detector, in the nonlocal geometry the absence\nof charge current at the detector justifies treating F1 and\nF2 differently. We confirmed this behavior by solving the\ndiffusion equations including spin scattering at the F2 /N\ninterface [26]. Equation (2) still holds if an effective spin\npolarization is redefined as P2 \u2192 P \u03032 , where [27]\nP \u03032 =\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2032\u22121\n\u2032\u22121\n(R2\u2191\n\u2212 R2\u2193\n) \u00b1 (R2\u2191\n\u2212 R2\u2193\n)\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2032\u22121\n\u2032\u22121\n(R2\u2191\n+ R2\u2193\n) + (R2\u2191\n+ R2\u2193\n)\n\n= PA \u00b1 PS .\n\n(6)\n\nThe primed quantities, absent in Eq. (3), represent\n\n\f4\nthe spin-scattering contact resistances [13] which allow\nthe existence of non-vanishing RS and PS [28]. Even\nthough PA includes spin conserving and spin-scattering\nresistances, Fig. 4(b) shows clearly that it has the expected 1\u2212\u03b7T 3/2 dependence. This is clarified by Fig. 3(d)\nwhich shows that the measured contact resistance, proportional to the inverse of the denominator of Eq. (6), is\nweakly T dependent for 100K<T<300K. Therefore the\nstrong T dependence of PS comes from the difference in\nthe interfacial spin scattering of the two spin channels at\n\u2032\u22121\n\u2032\u22121\nthe detector (R2\u2191\n\u2212 R2\u2193\n), which can be expected at a\nmagnetic interface. While a detailed quantitative confirmation requires a fully microscopic picture, the increase\nof up to 30% in the relative scattering of spin \u2191 and \u2193 at\nF2 for 100K<T<300K can be expected given the large\nspin polarization (>50%) of surface states of Co [29].\nFigure 3 rules out spurious voltages offsets that can\nappear from the electrostatics of the cross geometry of\nthe injector [30], since the value of that voltage would\ndepend linearly on the contact resistance and the resistivity of both the Cu line and the Co injector, which are\nlinear in temperature, as opposed to the measured offset which increases nonlinearly. Samples in which one or\nboth of the Co contacts had been replaced by Cu showed\nRS \u2248 0, ruling out artifacts coming from the setup. Increasing the separation L between F1 and F2 caused the\nvalue of RS to decrease and approach zero for large values of L (\u2248 2\u03bcm), implying that RS is produced by the\ninterplay of F1 and F2 .\nWe verified these measurements by repeating them at\nDC, studied the response at higher frequencies, and replaced the lock-in amplifiers by a spectrum analyzer. We\nalso checked the linearity of the signal with respect to\nthe bias current. Leakage currents through the input\nimpedance of the lock-in were negligible, and capacitive\n\n[1] I. \u017duti\u0107, J. Fabian, and S. Das Sarma, Rev. Mod. Phys.\n76, 323 (2004).\n[2] V. A.

Heating, coupled with the difference in Seebeck coefficients of\nthe two metals, can generate spurious voltages. However,\nthese voltages should only appear at twice the fundamental frequency since the power goes as I2 . We studied this\npossibility by looking at the second harmonic response\nusing both lock-in measurements and a spectrum analyzer, and were able to see a signal \u221d I2 . Furthermore,\nwe replaced Co by Cr whose relative Seebeck coefficient\nwith respect to Cu is opposite in sign, and were able to\nsee a change in the sign of the I2 dependence, confirming\nthe existence of thermal voltages at the second harmonic\nand not at the fundamental frequency.\nIn conclusion, temperature dependent measurements\nof the nonlocal resistance in F1 /N/F2 junctions reveal\na previously overlooked asymmetry in the contact resistance for different relative orientations of the magnetizations in ferromagnets F1 and F2 . We performed systematic control experiments to rule out a spurious origin\nof this asymmetry due to the electrostatic field distribution at imperfect contacts, Joule heating and magnetothermal effects. Our analysis suggests that a conventional interpretation of spin injection which assumes spinconserving interfaces needs to be generalized [31]. We\ndeveloped a phenomenological model to show that the\nobserved data is consistent with temperature dependent\nspin-flip interfacial scattering. We believe that additional\ntheoretical and experimental work will be required before\na complete understanding of this new spin-flip effect is\nobtained.\nThis work was supported by NSF, NSA Laboratory for\nPhysical Science, and NRC (I.\u017d.).
