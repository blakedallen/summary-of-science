New infrared singularities in the correlation functions appear even for massive\ntheories [9]-[21]. This phenomenon is due to an interplay between the UV and IR induced by the Moyal phase appearing in the vertices. Recently some of the amplitudes\nof these non-commutative theories have been derived from string theory [22]-[28].\nIn this note we analyze at the perturbative level the non-commutative version\nof a non-relativistic scalar field theory in 2 + 1 dimensions in order to gather more\ninformation about the UV/IR mixing and the structure of degrees of freedom of\nnon-commutative theories. Our motivation for investigating non-relativistic noncommutative field theories is twofold.\nIn non-relativistic quantum theory\nnon-commutativity of space arises often in the effective description of charged particles carrying dipole momentum moving in strong magnetic fields [29]. It seems\nnatural then to look for the by now well-known UV/IR mixing in the context of\nnon-relativistic quantum field theory. Another more theoretical motivation is that\nit might be easier to understand the effects of non-commutativity of space in simpler setups than relativistic quantum field theory. We also would like to emphasize\nthat due to an ordering ambiguity in the interaction vertices the particular model we\nare considering can not be obtained as the non-relativistic limit of a relativistic field\nmodel!\nAs we will see, also in this non-relativistic example there is an interplay between\nthe IR and UV behaviour due to the Moyal phases. For the two-point function a\nsingularity of delta-function type appears. This should be contrasted with the pole\nlike singularities found for relativistic theories [9]. For the four-point function we find\na singularity of a more familiar, logarithmic type.\nWe study the system at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential \u03bc.\nWe compute the thermodynamical potential up to two loops. The presence of the\nchemical potential provides another scale besides the non-commutativity scale and\ntemperature. If \u2212\u03bc >> T , the non-planar contribution is strongly suppressed with\nrespect to the planar one for thermal wavelengths smaller than the non-commutativity\nscale. This suggest a reduction of degrees of freedom running in the non-planar\ngraphs at high temperature [20][21]. The limit of \u2212\u03bc << T is more involved. The\nnon-planar graph does not appear to be strongly suppressed as a function of the\ntemperature. It depends crucially on the ratio between the chemical potential and\nthe non-commutativity scale.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we study the two and four-point\nfunction up to one-loop. In section 3 we study the free energy up to two loops. We\ngive some conclusions in section 4.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTwo and Four-Point Function at one-loop\n\nWe will start by introducing the model. We will work in 2 + 1 dimensions, where\nthe non-commutativity affects only the spatial directions. Non-commutative R2 is\ndefined by the commutation relations\n[x\u03bc , x\u03bd ] = i\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwith \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b8\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd . The algebra of functions on non-commutative R2 is defined through\nthe star product\ni\n\n(f \u2217 g)(x) := lim e 2 \u03b8\ny\u2192x\n\n\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 x \u2202 y\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\nf (x)g(y)\n\n(2.2)\n\nHere x\u03bc are taken to be ordinary c-numbers. We will study a self-interacting nonrelativistic scalar field model, defined by the Lagrangian\n!\n~2\n\u2207\ng\nL = \u03c6\u2020 i\u2202t +\n\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2020 \u2217 \u03c6\u2020 \u2217 \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c6 .\n(2.3)\n2\n4\nThe star product has been dropped in the term bilinear in the fields. This is consistent\nsince we can always delete one star in monomials of fields in the action. This is\nequivalent to neglecting total derivative terms. In ordinary space-time this model\narises as the low energy limit of a real relativistic scalar field with \u03c64 self interaction.\nIt has been studied in [30] as a model for applying renormalization to quantum\nmechanics with \u03b4-function potential [31]. The model is scale invariant in ordinary\nspace-time since scale transformations in a non relativistic theory take the form t \u2192\n\u03bb2 t, ~x \u2192 \u03bb~x. The scaling of t is due to the fact that in (2.3) the mass has been\nscaled out by redefining t \u2192 m t. It has been shown that the theory acquires a scale\nanomaly upon quantization quite analogous to what happens in relativistic quantum\nfield theory. Of course, in the case considered\u221ahere scale invariance is already broken\nat tree level by the non-commutativity scale \u03b8.\nIn going from ordinary space-time to the non-commutative one an ordering ambiguity for the interaction term arises. We fix that ambiguity in (2.3) by putting\nthe \u03c6\u2020 fields to the left. The other possible ordering would have been to chose\n\u2032\nLint = \u2212 g4 \u03c6\u2020 \u2217 \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c6\u2020 \u2217 \u03c6. A relativistic complex scalar field model with both interaction vertices has been considered in [15]. There the authors showed that the\ntheory was renormalizable at one-loop level only when g = g \u2032 or g = 0. We will later\non show that no such restriction arises in the non-relativistic model (2.3).\nThe solutions to the free field equations can be written as Fourier transforms\nR d2 k\n~\n\u03c6(~x, t) =\na(~k) e\u2212i(\u03c9k t\u2212k~x) ,\n(2\u03c0)2\nR d2 k \u2020\n(2.4)\n~ i(\u03c9k t\u2212~k~x) ,\n\u03c6\u2020 (~x, t) =\n2 a (k) e\n(2\u03c0)\n\nwhere \u03c9k =\n\n~k 2\n.\n2\n\nThe propagator of the theory is given by\nZ 2\n~\nd kd\u03c9 i e\u2212i(\u03c9t\u2212k~x)\n\u2020\n.\nhT \u03c6(x)\u03c6 (y)i =\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03c9 \u2212 ~k 2 + i\u01eb\n\n2\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fWe want to compute now the one-loop correction to the two-point function. This\nis given by the tadpole diagram of figure 1. In ordinary space-time we can employ\na normal ordering prescription setting the tadpole to zero. In the non-commutative\ntheory we expect a dependence of the tadpole on the external momentum due to the\ncontribution of the non-planar diagrams. The planar and non-planar contributions\nare given by\n\u2212i\u03a3(E, p~) = Iplanar + Inon\u2212planar ,\n\n(2.6)\n\nand\n=\n\ng\n2\n\nInon\u2212planar =\n\ng\n2\n\nIplanar\n\nR\nR\n\nd\u03c9d2 k\n1\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03c9\u2212 ~k2 +i\u01eb\n2\nd\u03c9d2 k exp(ip\u0303k)\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03c9\u2212 ~k2 +i\u01eb\n2\n\n(2.7)\n,\n\nwhere p\u0303\u03bc = \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd p\u03bd . In order to do the \u03c9-integration we recall that (x + i\u01eb)\u22121 =\nP x1 \u2212 i\u03c0\u03b4(x). This leaves us with the ~k-integrations\nIplanar\n\n=\n\nInon\u2212planar =\n\n\u2212ig\n8\u03c0\n\nR\u039b\n\n\u2212ig\n16\u03c0 2\n\n0\n\nR\n\n\u2212ig 2\n\u039b\n16\u03c0\n\nkdk =\nd\u03c6\n\nR\u039b\n0\n\nip\u0303k cos(\u03c6)\n\ne\n\n(2.8)\nkdk =\n\n\u2212ig\n\u039bJ1 (p\u0303\u039b) ,\n8\u03c0 p\u0303\n\nwhere we introduced a UV-cutoff \u039b and J1 (x) denotes a Bessel function. The\nquadratic divergence from the planar part can be removed by adding a corresponding counterterm to the action, Lc = \u03b4\u03bc\u03c6\u2020\u03c6. The non-planar part reproduces the\ndivergence for p\u0303 \u2192 0 since limx\u21920 J1x(x) = 12 . In the limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e, using\nRquadratic\n\u221e\nJ1 (x)dx = 1, it is straightforward to show that the result from the non-planar\n0\ndiagram represents a delta-function in polar coordinates in p\u0303-space. We find then\n\u03a3(E, p) =\n\ng 2\n\u03b4 (~p) .\n4 \u03b82\n\n(2.9)\n\nThus the situation is rather analogous to what happened in relativistic field theories.\nThe limits of \u039b \u2192 \u221e and p \u2192 0 do not commute.\nIt is interesting to see that we can recover the delta-type singularity of the nonplanar diagram as a limit of the relativistic case.

Therefore in the non-commutative case our model 2.3 is not the non-relativistic\nlimit of a real relativistic scalar field. It turns out however that only the first vertex\nin 2.12 contributes to the non-planar tadpole diagram. We should be able then to\nobtain the result 2.9 from the relativistic case. Comparing 2.3 with 2.12 we see that\n\u03bb = 6mg 1 .

The relativistic dispersion relation is (p0 \u2212\nm)(p0 + m) \u2212 p~2 \u2212 \u03a3rel = 0. Setting p0 = m + E where E is the non-relativistic energy\nwe can go to the non relativistic limit by scaling m \u2192 \u221e and E \u2192 0 keeping the\nproduct Em = \u03c9 fixed. This is the non relativistic energy of dimension 2. In this\nway the relativistic dispersion relation becomes twice the non relativistic one if we\nidentify limm\u2192\u221e \u03a3rel = 2\u03a3non\u2212rel . Substituting for \u03bb it is then easy to show that\ng\nlim Irel = \u2212i \u03b4 2 (p\u0303) .\nm\u2192\u221e\n2\n1\n\n(2.15)\n\nRecall that in 2.3 we have rescaled t \u2192 mt and L \u2192 mL in order to factor out the mass\ndependence.\n\n4\n\n\fThus we reproduce precisely the non relativistic result (2.9).\nIf we formally sum all the tadpole diagrams contributing to the two-point function\nwe obtain the following modified dispersion relation\n\u03c9=\n\ng\np2\n+ 2 \u03b4 2 (~p).\n2\n4\u03b8\n\n(2.16)\n\nIn the resummation one encounters arbitrary high powers of \u03b4-functions. Thus the\nresumation is highly ill defined. On the other hand we just showed that the dispersion\nrelation 2.16 arises also as the limit of the relativistic one. Therefore we expect it to\nbe correct on physical grounds. Alternatively we could keep the cutoff and arrive to\n2.16 with a suitable smeared \u03b4-function. The meaning of 2.16 is that the energy of the\nzero momentum states is shifted by an infinite amount. However, it is important to\nnote that the delta-function in the dispersion relation is integrable. Thus wavepackets\ncontaining zero momentum components still will have finite energy.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: The one-loop contribution to the four-point function. The diagrams with\nmomentum flow as indicated in (b) vanish identically in non relativistic field theory.\n\nWe would like now to evaluate the four-point function at one-loop. In a nonrelativistic theory only the s channel contributes, since the t and u channels contain\ninternal lines flowing both forward and backwards in time and this evaluates to zero\nin a non-relativistic theory (see figure 2). As shown in [15] the contributions from u\nand t channel make the relativistic complex scalar field non-renormalizable if one does\nnot also include the second possible ordering for the vertex. It is thus the vanishing of\nu- and t- channel that allows us to ignore the second possible ordering in the vertex.\nThe non-relativistic one-loop four-point function is [30]\n!\n2\n2\n\u039b\n\u03bb\nlog\n\u03934 (\u03c9i , p~i , \u039b) = \u2212\n,\n(2.17)\n2 + i\u03c0\n8\u03c0\nE \u2212 P4\nwhere E = \u03c91 + \u03c92 = \u03c91\u2032 + \u03c92\u2032 and P = p1 + p2 = q1 + q2 are the center of mass energy\nand momentum, and \u03c9i , pi and \u03c9i\u2032 , p\u2032i the energy and momentum of the incoming and\noutcoming particles respectively; \u039b is an UV cutoff.\nThe one-loop four-point function for the non-commutative case is given by\ni\u03bb2\np\u03031 p2\nq\u03031 q2\n\u03934 =\ncos\ncos\n2\n2\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 kd\u03c9\n(2\u03c0)3 (\u03c9 \u2212\n\n5\n\ncos2 P\u03032k\nk2\n2\n\n+ i\u01eb)(E \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212\n\n(k\u2212P )2\n2\n\n+ i\u01eb)\n\n,\n\n(2.18)\n\n\fUsing cos2 P\u03032k = 1+cos2 P\u0303 k and writing cos P\u0303 k in terms of exponentials, we can separate\nthe planar and non-planar contributions.

For angles such that P\u0303 .k < 0, it is\nconvenient to use a contour in the |k|-plane encircling the fourth quadrant.

The resulting dependence of the non-planar diagram on the\nexternal momentum is smoother than for the two-point function. The external momentum P\u0303 acts as an UV cutoff very much in the same way as in previously analyzed\nexamples of relativistic theories [9][12][16][19].\n\n3\n\nFinite Temperature Behaviour\n\nIn this section we analyze the thermodynamics of our model. The physical reason to\nconsider this system in a heat bath is to check if there is a reduction of degrees of\nfreedom for the non-planar sector of the theory. In the case of relativistic theories\nthis was shown to happen for thermal wavelengths smaller than the non-commutative\nlength scale [20][21] .\nBefore we embark on doing the calculation we remind the reader of the following\nformula\nX\nn\n\n1\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n= \u2212 \u2212 \u03b2x\n.\ni\u03c9n \u2212 x\n2 e \u22121\n\n6\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fwhere \u03c9n = 2\u03c0n\n. The first term on the r.h.s. represents the zero temperature contribu\u03b2\ntions. The resulting zero temperature divergences can be canceled by the introduction\nof appropriate couterterms.\nWe will compute the thermodynamic potential up to two loop. In order to cure infrared divergences we will introduce a chemical potential term \u03bc\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 in our lagrangian\n2.3. The introduction of a chemical potential seems natural taking into account the\nrenormalization properties of the theory at zero temperature. Notice that now three\nscales are present. Correspondingly we have two regimes of high temperature. By\nhigh temperature we mean thermal wavelength 2 much smaller than the scale of non\ncommutativity, or equivalently, T \u03b8 >> 1. The physics is then still dependent on the\nchemical potential3 . In the regime \u2212\u03bc >> T we expect a classical particle picture to\nbe valid. We will also investigate the regime T >> \u2212\u03bc, where classical field theory is\na good approximation to quantum statistical mechanics.\nThe one-loop contribution to the thermodynamic potential F = \u2212T log Z is given\nby\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n\u03bc\nd2 k\n2\n\u2212\u03b2( k2 \u2212\u03bc)\nT\n\u2212T\n=\nT\nLi\n1\n\u2212\ne\n,\n(3.2)\nlog\n1\n\u2212\ne\n2\n(2\u03c0)2\nwhere Li2 denotes the dilogarithm.

The (T =\n0, T = 0) is a temperature independent divergence. The (T = 0, T ) contributions are\ndivergent. They can be canceled by adding counterterm of the form of the chemical\npotential \u03b4\u03bc \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6.

The strength of the suppression will depend on the value of the two\ndimensionless quantities \u03b8T and \u2212\u03bc/T .\nWe will analyze first the regime \u2212\u03bc/T >> 1. In this limit we can substitute the\nBose-Einstein distribution by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This corresponds\nto consider low densities for the thermal gas. This is the particle approximation to\nthe quantum field theory. In this limit we can evaluate the integral explicitly,\nT\nInon\u2212planar\n=\n\n2\u03bc\ng\nT2\neT .\n2\n2\n8\u03c0 1 + (\u03b8T )\n\n(3.7)\n\nFor \u03b8T << 1 planar and non-planar graphs give the same contribution. For \u03b8T >> 1\nthere is a very strong suppression of the non-planar sector. The T 2 dependence of\u221a\n3.4\nis substituted by 1/\u03b82 . When T is larger than 1/\u03b8 the thermal wavelength \u03bbT \u223c 1/ T\nbecomes smaller than the radius of a Moyal cell. Equation 3.7 seems to indicate that\nthe effective wavelength of the modes that circulate in the non-planar loop can not\nbe smaller than the radius of the Moyal cell.\nWe analyze now the regime of small \u2212 T\u03bc << 1. The classical thermal field theory\napproximation consists in dimensionally reducing the system along the Euclidean time\ndirection, or equivalently, considering only the zero mode in the sum over Matsubara\nfrequencies. In the limit of small \u2212 T\u03bc this approximation is valid up to modes of\nmomentum k 2 < T . On the other hand the non-commutative phases suppress modes\nof momentum k 2 > \u03b81 as can be explicitly seen from the Bessel function appearing\nin 3.6. Therefore when \u03b8T >> 1 and \u2212 T\u03bc << 1 we expect that the classical field\napproximation will describe the leading behaviour of the non-planar sector [21] 4 .\nThe integral 3.6 can be evaluated in this limit with the result\n\u0001\ng\nT\nInon\u2212planar\n= 2 T 2 G (\u2212\u03bc\u03b8)2 ,\n(3.8)\n8\u03c0\n\u0001\nR\n1\n0\n\u0393(1 + s)3 \u0393(\u2212s)z s ds denotes a Meijer G-function.\nwhere G(z) = G31\n13 z|000 = 2\u03c0i\nThe suppression of the non-planar sector with respect to the planar one appears\nin this case to be only logarithmic with the temperature. However, contrary to the\nprevious case, the ratio between planar and non-planar contributions depends also on\n\u2212\u03bc\u03b8. For \u2212\u03bc\u03b8 large the function G tends to zero implying an additional suppression\nfor the non-planar sector. For \u2212\u03bc\u03b8 small G diverges. This divergence is associated\nto the infrared problems of the theory at small chemical potential.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nWe have seen that the phenomena of the UV/IR mixing is not only a characteristic\nof relativistic theories but also occurs in non-relativistic theories. The model we have\n4\n\nNotice that in our case the two spatial directions are non-commutative. Therefore we expect\nthe suppression of high momenta by \u03b8 to be more effective than in the cases studied in [21], where\nthe classical approximation was applied to a system with odd spatial dimensions.\n\n8\n\n\fconsidered is a non-commutative version of a 2+1 dimensional model that describes\nmany particle quantum mechanics with a delta function interactions. For the twopoint function we have seen the appearance of IR singularity of delta function type\nwhich changes the dispersion relation. For the four-point function we found a logarithmic singularity. Thus the non-relativistic model has an UV/IR mixing similar to\nthe relativistic field theories studied so far. Since our model can not be embedded in\na natural way in a string theory one might interpret this as slight evidence that the\nIR singularities are not connected to closed string states that do not decouple from\nthe field theory.\nThe renormalizability of non commutative field theories to all loop order is still\nan open problem [14][8]. The non relativistic scalar field model might proof to be\na simple and interesting toy model for such a study. The fact that some diagrams\nvanish identically (such as t- and u-channel contributions to the four-point function)\ncould simplify a systematic study of renormalizability. That in resumming the selfenergy insertions in the propagator one has to deal with powers of delta-functions\nshould not a priori be considered as a an unsurmountable obstacle. As we argued\nsuch a formal resummation is physically well motivated. Indeed the delta function\nappears also in the non relativistic limit of the resummed propagator of relativistic\n\u03c64 theory.\nWe have also studied the two loop correction to free energy and we have seen\nthat the non-planar part of the theory is very sensitive to the value of the chemical\npotential. At large negative values it turns out that the non-planar part is strongly\nsuppressed compared to the planar part. In this regime the behaviour is similar\nto what has been found in relativistic theories in [21]. The thermal wavelength of\nthe degrees of freedom in non-planar diagrams can not become smaller that the\nnon commutativity scale. Therefore these degrees of freedom are suppressed at high\ntemperature.\nThis interpretation is less clear at high temperature and small chemical potential.\nIt turned out that the non-planar part is at most logarithmically suppressed. Given\nthat these two regimes behave so differently it should be an interesting direction\nof further research to study the effects of a chemical potential also in relativistic,\nnon-commutative field theories.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Luis Alvarez-Gaum\u00e9, Herbert Balasin, Jos\u00e9 Barb\u00f3n, C\u00e9sar\nG\u00f3mez, Harald Grosse, Cristina Manuel, Antonio Pineda, Toni Rebhan and Miguel\nAngel Vazquez-Mozo for helpful discussions.
