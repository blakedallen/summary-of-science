Introduction\nHeat conduction in low dimensional systems (less than three dimension) has been attracting increasing attention in the past decade.1 From the fundamental point of view, one would\nlike to know whether the fundamental transport theory for bulk material, such as the Fourier\nlaw of heat conduction, is still valid for such low dimensional systems. In fact, the question is\nnot trivial, as there is still no rigorous proof available so far. From application point of view,\nit is an indispensable question to understand the heat conduction properties of the nanoscale\nmaterials before they are put into application.2\nIn order to understand the underlying physical mechanism of heat conduction in one\ndimensional (1D) systems, different lattice models with and without on-site (pinning) potential\nhave been used, such as the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model3 without on-site potential, the Frenkel\nKontorova model,4 and the \u03c64 model with on-site potential.5 With these models, the roles of\nanharmonicity and the on-site potential in heat conduction in 1D systems have been nicely\ndemonstrated. For example, in the system without on-site potential, a size-dependent thermal\nconductivity has been observed3 due to a superdiffusive motion of phonons.6 In the system\nwith on-site potential, the scattering from on-site potential makes phonon transport diffusively,\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nE-mail address: zhliu@phy.ecnu.edu.cn\nE-mail address: phylibw@nus.edu.sg\n1/10\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nleading to a size-independent thermal conductivity. Considering the fact that in the 1D models,\nthe lattice is restricted to longitudinal vibration only, i.e., the transverse motions have been\ncompletely ignored, we conclude that these 1D models are too simple to be used for modelling\nheat conduction in realistic nanostructures, such as nanotube and nanowires.\nIndeed, the heat conduction behavior changes when the transverse vibrations are considered. In a recent work, Wang and Li7 considered a model of quasi 1D chain connected by\n2D spring with a bending angle interaction. The lattices are allowed to vibrate in longitudinal as well as in one transverse direction. The results show that for a fixed lattice constant,\nthe anomalous heat conduction coefficient \u03ba(N ) changes from a logarithmic divergence with\nsystem size N , i.e, logN for large transverse coupling, to a 1/3 power law divergence, N 1/3 ,\nat intermediate coupling, and then to a 2/5 power law divergence, N 2/5 at low temperatures\nand weak coupling. The results are mainly due to the mode coupling between the longitudinal\nmodes and transverse modes.\nIn this paper, we study the quasi 1D chain with motion in both the longitudinal direction\nand the two transverse directions. Namely, the lattices can vibrate in all three directions,\nwhich is more closer to real nano-scale quasi 1D systems. For simplicity, we call our system\na 3D harmonic chain. To be more practical, we will not going to discuss the thermodynamic\nlimit (length goes to infinity) as most of the nanoscale systems are of finite length. Instead,\nwe shall focus on the effect of the lattice constant. The model discussed by Wang and Li7 can\nbe considered as a simplified polymer chain, while the model studied in our current paper can\nbe considered as simplified nanotube or nanowire model.\nWe shall demonstrate soon that, in 1D case, the lattice constant does not play any role\nwhen the atoms can be considered as moving around its equilibrium; while in 3D case, the\nsituation is totally different and the lattice constant will influence the heat conduction. It goes\nback to the 1D case when the lattice constant a \u2192 \u221e.\n2.

This is interesting. It indicates that in our system, the model with twice smaller lattice\nconstant is identical with the one with four times smaller temperature.\nFor the case of fixed temperatures Th and Tl , the re-scaling of q1w and qN w will cause\ndifferent \u03be\u0307h and \u03be\u0307l , namely, the effect of lattice constant will show up through the heat baths\nand result in different behaviors of heat conduction. This can be understood like this. For\na given Th and Tl , the average of the amplitude of q\u0307iw are fixed for the heat bath particles.\n\u2032 .

Generally, with the decrease of a, the transverse motion will become\n\u2032 reaches\nmore and more important and thus influence the heat conduction more. When qiw\n\nthe magnitude of unity or of lattice constant, the heat conduction will be saturated, thus we\nmay observe a platform for small enough a.\n3. Heat conductivity versus system size and lattice constant\nThe temperature of the i'th lattice is defined as T (i) = (hp2ix i+hp2iy i+hp2iz i)/3 and the heat\n\nflux along the chain in stationary state is defined as J = hpix\n\n\u2202Vi+1,i\n\u2202xi\n\n+ piy\n\n\u2202Vi+1,i\n\u2202yi\n\n+ piz\n\n\u2202Vi+1,i\n\u2202zi i\n\nwhere Vi+1,i = 12 (|ri+1 \u2212 ri | \u2212 a)2 . From the Fourier law J = \u2212\u03ba\u2207T , the heat conductivity\n\ncan be expressed as\n\n\u03ba(N ) = J(N \u2212 1)/(Th \u2212 Tl ).\n\n(6)\n\nFor fixed Th and Tl , JN can be used to represent the \u03ba. For a momentum conservative 1D\nlattice, it is found that the heat conduction is anomalous,1, 3, 6 namely, the heat conductivity\ndepends on the system size as\n\u03ba(N ) \u223c N \u03b2 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b2 varies from system to system. In this paper, we study the dependence of \u03b2 on the\nlattice constant a. For comparison, we study two concrete cases: a relatively high temperature\nregime and a relatively low temperature regime. For the low temperature case, we take Th =\n0.07 and Tl = 0.05, thus the system temperature defined by T \u2261 (Th + Tl )/2 is T = 0.06.\n\nFor high temperature case, we take Th = 0.3 and Tl = 0.2, thus the system temperature is\nT = 0.25 which is about four times higher than the previous one. The results are shown in\n\nFig.1(a) and (b). Our numerical simulations reveal that N J increases with N by different\nscaling for different a and different temperatures Th/l .\nAs we have pointed out early that, in the dimensionless Hamiltonian, the system for\ndifferent a and different heat bath temperatures can be equivalent, therefore, in Fig 1(c) we\n\u221a\ndraw \u03b2 versus the quantity a/ T .\nIt is quite obvious that two sets of data from Fig.1(a) and (b) almost overlap with each\nother in Fig.1(c). We have also checked other pairs of Th and Tl ( such as Th = 0.1 and\nTl = 0.005) and found that they also overlap with each other. From Fig.1(c) it is easy to\n\u221a\nsee that \u03b2 goes to unity for a/ T > 300, indicating the large lattice constant or very low\ntemperature makes the 3D chain equivalent to a 1D harmonic chain. Moreover, \u03b2 drops with\n\u221a\nthe decrease of a or increase of temperature, and reaches a platform for a/ T \u2264 15, confirming\n\nthe theoretic analysis of the previous section.\n\nWe have checked the behaviors of the particles and found that the particles oscillate\naround their equilibrium positions and can be considered as local when a is relatively large\nand their oscillation can not be considered as local when a is in the range of platform.

It can be\nseen that the positions at i = 17 \u2212 23 satisfy |xi | > a(= 2), and the similar situation occurs in\nFig. 2(b) for i = 12. This kind of non-local behavior causes the platform. High environment\n\ntemperature causes large deviation of |xi | from a, hence results in a larger platform as is shown\n\nin Fig. 1(c).\n\n4. Anomalous energy diffusion\nIn order to confirm further the influence of lattice constant on the heat conduction in the\n3D harmonic chain, we study the diffusion for different a. First, we let the two heat baths have\nthe same temperature and let the chain run enough time to achieve the equilibrium. Then we\ngive a pulse of energy, which is larger than the energy of the equilibrium state, at the middle\nparticle of the chain and investigate how the pulse of energy spreads to the other part of the\nchain. Figure 3 shows the result for Tl = Th = 0.2, N = 201, and the results are obtained by\naveraging over 103 realizations where the initial pulse of five times the average momentum is\nadded at the particle i = 101, i.e., at t = 0 we change the velocity of the middle particle to 5\n\n5/10\n\n\fJ.

Ref.6 gives an approach to measure the energy diffusion by\nthe formula, \u03c3 2 (t) =\n\nR\n\n2\n(E(x,t)\u2212E\n0 )(x\u2212x0 ) dx\nR\n,\n(E(x,t)\u2212E0 )dx\n\nwhere E(x, t) is the energy distribution at time t,\n\nx0 is the position of initial energy pulse at t = 0, E0 is the energy of the equilibrium state\nwith temperature T . However, in the 3-D case, this approach does not work very well because\nthe energy E(x, t) fluctuates around E0 and makes the diffusion contributions in the integral\nof this equation cancel each other.\nA correct way is to make the diffusion contributions always positive, i.e., make the numerator in this equation positive at each position x. Ref.9 points out recently that, if the pulse is\nvery small and is initially localized at i = i0 , the energy diffusion can be given by\nX\n\u03c3 2 (t) =\n(i \u2212 i0 )2 \u03b4(2) (i, t),\n\n(8)\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03b4(2) (i, t) = (\u03b4vi (t))2 in the 1D case.

In\nnumerical simulations, after the system arrives at the equilibrium we record the time as\nt = 0 and copy all the variables xi and pi to a new set of variables x1i and p1i except the\nmiddle one p1101 = 1.5p101 where 1.5 chosen so as to make the initial pulse small enough.\nHence, we have two set of systems (xi , pi ) and (x1i , p1i ) with x1i = xi , p1i = pi for i 6= i0\n\nand x1i0 = xi0 , p1i0 = 1.5pi0 at t = 0. As time goes on, the corresponding variables will\ngradually become different because of the diffusion of the pulse. Then, we can obtain a nonzero\n\u03b4pix (t) = p1ix (t)\u2212pix (t), \u03b4xi (t) = x1i (t)\u2212xi (t), and so on. In this way, we can find the relation\n\u03c3 2 (t) \u223c t\u03b1 through Eqs. (9) and (8). Figure 4(a) shows the result for three typical values of a\n\nat T = 0.05, which are obtained by averaging over 103 realizations. The line with \"squares\"\n\ndenotes the case of a = 2, the line with \"circles\" the case of a = 16, and the line with\n\"triangles\" the case of a = 128. We have the similar situations for other a. The slopes of the\nlines in Fig.4(a) give the exponent \u03b1.\nFig. 4(b) show the case of T = 0.2.\n\n\u221a\nFor the same reason as in Fig 1, we also draw here \u03b1 versus a/ T in 4(c).

Conclusions and discussions\nIn summary, we have studied heat conduction in a quasi 1-D system with 3D vibration.\nFor finite length (around 1, 000 units or, for a typical crystal atom chain, 100 nanometers),\nthe heat conduction is anomalous and energy diffusion is superdiffusive. Moreover, we have\ndemonstrated that both the anomalous heat conduction exponent \u03b2 and the anomalous diffu\u221a\nsion exponent \u03b1 depends on the dimensionless quantity, a/ T . In particular, we found that\n\u221a\n\u03b1 = A + B ln(a/ T ) for reasons to be further investigated.\n\n8/10\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc.

Therefore, the\nobtained results may shed lights in understanding heat conduction in nanoscale structures,\nespecially in networked structure.10 As the quasi 1D systems such as the nanowires and\nnanotubes can be fabricated easily these days, it is therefore of great interest to do the\nmeasurement on the size dependent thermal conductivity of these systems and to compare\nwith the results presented.\nAcknowlegments\nThis work was partly supported by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant\nNo. 10775052 and No. 10635040 (ZL) and a Faculty Research Grant of National University of\nSingapore.\n\n9/10\n\n\fJ.
