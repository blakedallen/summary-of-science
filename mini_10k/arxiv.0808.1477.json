In this paper, we introduce (almost) skew 2-nomial algebras and\nlook for a one-sided or two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for such algebras at a\nmodest level. That is, we establish the existence of a skew multiplicative Kbasis for every skew 2-nomial algebra, and we explore the existence of a (left,\nright, or two-sided) monomial ordering for an (almost) skew 2-nomial algebra.\nAs distinct from commonly recognized algebras holding a Gr\u00f6bner basis theory\n(such as algebras of the solvable type [K-RW] and some of their homomorphic images), a subclass of skew 2-nomial algebras that have a left Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis theory but may not necessarily have a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory,\nrespectively a subclass of skew 2-nomial algebras that have a right Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis theory but may not necessarily have a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory,\nare determined such that numerous quantum binomial algebras (which provide\nbinomial solutions to the Yang-baxter equation [Laf], [G-I2]) are involved.\n\nLet K be a field, and let R be a finitely generated free K-algebra, or a path algebra defined\nby a finite directed graph over K. Then it is well-known that R holds an effective Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis theory ([Mor], [FFG]) which generalizes successfully the celebrated algorithmic Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis theory for commutative polynomial algebras [Bu]. Also from the literature (e.g. [AL],\n[Ap], [HT], [K-RW], [Li1], [BGV], [Lev]) we know that many important quotient algebras of\nR, such as exterior algebras, Clifford algebras, solvable polynomial algebras and some of their\nhomomorphic images hold an effective Gr\u00f6bner basis theory. In general for an arbitrary (twosided) ideal I of R, it seems hardly to know the existence of a Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for the\nquotient algebra A = R/I. As we learnt from loc. cit., the first step to have a Gr\u00f6bner basis\n\u2217\n\nProject supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (10571038, 10971044).\ne-mail: huishipp@yahoo.com\n\n1\n\n\ftheory for A is to have a \"nice\" K-basis for A, for instance, a multiplicative K-basis B in the\nsense that u, v \u2208 B implies uv = 0 or uv \u2208 B. In [Gr2] the following result was obtained for\nalgebras defined by a 2-nomial ideal.\nTheorem ([Gr2], Theorem 2.3) Suppose that R is a K-algebra with multiplicative K-basis C.\nLet I be an ideal in R and \u03c0: R \u2192 R/I be the canonical surjection. Let \u03c0(C)\u2217 = \u03c0(C) \u2212 {0}.\nThen \u03c0(C)\u2217 is a multiplicative K-basis for R/I if and only if I is a 2-nomial ideal (i.e., I is\ngenerated by elements of the form u \u2212 v and w where u, v, w \u2208 C).\nAlso as shown in [Gr1, 2], if an algebra A has a multiplicative K-basis B and if there exists\na (two-sided) monomial ordering \u227a on B, then a Gr\u00f6bner basis theory may be developed for\nA and such a computational ideal theory can be further applied to develop a computational\nmodule theory (representation theory) of A. In [Li2], the Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for algebras with\na multiplicative K-basis [Gr1, 2] was extended to a Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for algebras with a\nskew multiplicative K-basis B (i.e., u, v \u2208 B implies uv = 0 or uv = \u03bbw for some nonzero \u03bb \u2208 K\nand w \u2208 B) and was used to study the structure theory of quotient algebras of a \u0393-graded\nK-algebra via their \u0393-leading and B-leading homogeneous algebras.\nInspired by the work of [Gr1, 2] and [Li2], in this paper we look for a (left, right, or twosided) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for skew 2-nomial algebras and almost skew 2-nomial algebras (see\nthe definitions in Section 3 and Section 4) at a modest level. More precisely, in Section 1 we\ngive a quick introduction to the Gr\u00f6bner basis theory of K-algebras with a skew multiplicative\nK-basis (where K is a field). In Section 2 we consider the class of K-algebras defined by\nmonomials and binomials of certain special types, and we demonstrate respectively the existence\nof a left Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for a subclass of such algebras that may not necessarily have a\nright Gr\u00f6bner basis theory, the existence of a right Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for a subclass of such\nalgebras that may not necessarily have a left Gr\u00f6bner basis theory, and the existence of a twosided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for a subclass of such algebras. The first two subclasses of algebras\nwe discussed include numerous quantum binomial algebras which provide binomial solutions\nto the Yang-Baxter equation ([Laf], [G-I2]), and the third subclass of algebras generalize the\nwell-known multiparameter quantized coordinate ring of affine n-space KQ [z1 , ..., zn ] (a precise\ndefinition is quoted from [GL] in the beginning of Section 1) which is a typical solvable polynomial\nalgebra in the sense of [K-RW]. Moreover, the practical examples given in this section also make\nthe basis for us to discuss the possibility of lifting a (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis\ntheory. Motivated by the results of Section 2 (mainly Theorem 2.2 \u2013 Corollary 2.5), in Section\n3 we introduce general skew 2-nomial algebras, and, as the first step of having a (left, right, or\ntwo-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory, the existence of a skew multiplicative K-basis for every skew\n2-nomial algebra is established. In Section 4 we introduce the class of almost skew 2-nomial\nalgebras so that the working principle of [Li2], combined with the results of Sections 2 \u2013 3,\nmay be applied effectively to the algebras with the associated graded algebra which is a skew\n\n2\n\n\f2-nomial algebra (as shown by Example (8) of Section 2). The final Section 5 is for summarizing\nseveral open problems related to previous sections.\nThroughout this paper, K always denotes a field. By a K-algebra we always mean a finitely\ngenerated associative K-algebra with identity element 1, that is, the algebra of the form \u039b =\nK[a1 , ..., an ] with the set of generators {a1 , ..., an }. For a given K-algebra \u039b, if a \"left ideal\"\nor \"right ideal\" of \u039b is not specified in the text, ideals are all \"two-sided ideals\". Moreover,\nwe write K \u2217 for K \u2212 {0}, and write hSi for the two-sided ideal generated by a subset S in the\nalgebra considered. Also we use N to denote the set of nonnegative integers.\n\n1. Grobner Bases with Respect to Skew Multiplicative K-basis\nBased on [Gr2] and [Li2], we begin with introducing the Gr\u00f6bner basis theory of K-algebras\nwith a skew multiplicative K-basis (see the definition below).\nLet \u039b = K[a1 , ..., an ] be a K-algebra generated by {a1 , ..., an } and let B be a K-basis of \u039b\nconsisting of elements of the form a\u03b1i11 a\u03b1i22 * * * a\u03b1inn where aij \u2208 {a1 , ..., an } and \u03b1j \u2208 N (in principle\nsuch a K-basis always exists). Denoting elements of B by using lowercase letters u, v, w, ..., if\nB has the property that\n(\nu * v = \u03bbw for some \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 , w \u2208 B,\nu, v \u2208 B implies\nor u * v = 0,\nthen we call B a skew multiplicative K-basis of \u039b.\nObviously, a skew multiplicative K-basis generalizes the notion of a multiplicative K-basis\nused in representation theory and classical Gr\u00f6bner basis theory of associative algebras (i.e.,\na K-basis B with the property that u, v \u2208 B implies uv = 0 or uv \u2208 B). Typical algebras\nwith a skew multiplicative K-basis are ordered semigroup algebras, free algebras, commutative\npolynomial algebras, path algebras defined by finite directed graphs, exterior algebras, and\nthe well-known skew polynomial algebra KQ [z1 , ..., zn ], or more precisely, the multiparameter\nquantized coordinate ring of affine n-space (e.g. see [GL]) defined subject to the relations\nzj zi = qji zi zj , 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, where Q = (qij ) is a multiplicatively antisymmetric n \u00d7 n matrix\n\u22121\n(i.e., qii = 1 and qij = qji\n\u2208 K \u2217 for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n). Section 2 and Section 3 will provide a large\nclass of algebras with a skew multiplicative K-basis.\nFrom now on we let \u039b be a K-algebra with a skew multiplicative K-basis B, as defined above.\nLet \u227a be a total ordering on B. Adopting the commonly used terminology in computational\nalgebra, we call an element u \u2208 B a monomial; and for each f \u2208 \u039b, say\nf=\n\ns\nX\n\n\u03bbi u i ,\n\n\u03bbi \u2208 K \u2217 , ui \u2208 B, u1 \u227a u2 \u227a * * * \u227a us ,\n\ni=1\n\n3\n\n\fthe leading monomial of f , denoted LM(f ), is defined as LM(f ) = us ; the leading coefficient\nof f , denoted LC(f ), is defined as LC(f ) = \u03bbs ; and the leading term of f , denoted LT(f ), is\ndefined as LT(f ) = LC(f )LM(f ) = \u03bbs us . If S \u2282 \u039b, then we write LM(S) = {LM(f ) | f \u2208 S}\nfor the set of leading monomials of S. If furthermore \u227a is a well-ordering, i.e., a total ordering\nsatisfying descending chain condition on B (in principle, though, such an ordering exists by the\nwell-known well-ordering theorem from axiomatic set theory), then a (left) admissible system\nfor \u039b may be introduced as follows.\n1.1. Definition (i) An ordering \u227a on B is said to be a left monomial ordering if \u227a is a\nwell-ordering such that the following conditions are satisfied:\n(LMO1) If w, u, v \u2208 B are such that w \u227a u and LM(vw), LM(vu) 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0}, then\nLM(vw) \u227a LM(vu).\n(LMO2) For w, u \u2208 B, if u = LM(vw) for some v \u2208 B with v 6= 1 (in the case 1 \u2208 B), then\nw \u227a u.\nIn this case we call the pair (B, \u227a) a left admissible system of \u039b.\n(ii) An ordering \u227a on B is said to be a two-sided monomial ordering if \u227a is a well-ordering such\nthat the following conditions are satisfied:\n(MO1) If w, u, v, s \u2208 B are such that w \u227a u and LM(vws), LM(vus) 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0}, then\nLM(vws) \u227a LM(vus).\n(MO2) For w, u \u2208 B, if u = LM(vws) for some v, s \u2208 B with v 6= 1 or s 6= 1 (in the case\n1 \u2208 B), then w \u227a u.\nIn this case we call the pair (B, \u227a) a two-sided admissible system of \u039b.\nRemark (i) Note that if \u039b is the path algebra defined by a finite directed graph with finitely\nn \u2265 2 edges e1 , ..., en , then the multiplicative K-basis B of \u039b does not contain the identity\nelement 1 = e1 + * * * + en . That is why we specified the case 1 \u2208 B.\n(ii) In the case that 1 \u2208 B, both (LMO2) and (MO2) turn out that 1 \u227a u for all u \u2208 B with\nu 6= 1. This shows that our definition of a (left, two-sided) monomial ordering is consistent with\nthat used in the classical commutative and noncommutative cases.\n(iii) If 1 \u2208 B and u, v \u2208 B \u2212 {1} satisfy uv = \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 , then LM(uv) = 1. Noticing (ii) above, we\nmust ask LM(uv) 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0} in order to make (LMO1) and (MO1) valid, .\nIf the algebra \u039b = \u2295\u03b3\u2208\u0393 \u039b\u03b3 is a \u0393-graded K-algebra, where \u0393 is an ordered semigroup by\na total ordering <, such that the skew multiplicative K-basis of \u039b consists of \u0393-homogeneous\nelements, and if \u227a is a well-ordering on B, then we may define the ordering \u227agr for u, v \u2208 B\nsubject to the rule:\nu \u227agr v \u21d4 d(u) < d(v)\nor d(u) = d(v) and u \u227a v,\nwhere d( ) is referred to as the degree function on homogeneous elements of \u039b. If \u227agr is a\n4\n\n\f(left or two-sided) monomial ordering on B in the sense of Definition 1.1, then we call \u227agr a\n(left or two-sided) \u0393-graded monomial ordering on B (or on \u039b). A typical N-graded (left or\ntwo-sided) monomial ordering is the N-graded (reverse) lexicographic ordering on a free Kalgebra KhX1 , ..., Xn i, a commutative polynomial K-algebra K[x1 , ..., xn ], and a path algebra\nKQ defined by a finite directed graph Q over K, where the N-gradation may be any weight Ngradation obtained by assigning to each generator a positive degree ni , for, in each case considered\nthe \"monomials\" in the standard K-basis B are all N-homogeneous elements.\nConvention Here let us make the convention once and for all that a lexicographic ordering\nalways means a \"left lexicographic ordering\" whenever such a ordering is used.\nSince B is a skew multiplicative K-basis of \u039b, the division of monomials is well-defined,\nnamely, for u, v \u2208 B, we say that u divides v, denoted u|v, provided there are w, s \u2208 B and\n\u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 such that v = \u03bbwus; similarly, for u, v \u2208 B, we say that u divides v from left-hand side,\nalso denoted u|v, provided there is some w \u2208 B and \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 such that v = \u03bbwu. If furthermore\n\u039b has a (left) admissible system (B, \u227a), then the division of monomials may be extended to\nthe division of two elements in \u039b as follows. Let f, g \u2208 \u039b. If LM(g)|LM(f ), then there are\nw, s \u2208 B and \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 such that LM(f ) = \u03bbwLM(g)s. Writing g = LC(g)LM(g) + g\u2032 with\nLM(g \u2032 ) \u227a LM(g) and LC(wgs \u2212 wg \u2032 s) = \u03bc, we have\nf=\n\nLC(f )\nwgs + f \u2032 satisfying LM(f ) = LM(wLM(g)s), LM(f \u2032 ) \u227a LM(f ).\n\u03bcLC(g)\n\nIf LM(g)|LM(f \u2032 ), repeat the same procedure for f \u2032 . While in the case that LM(g) 6 | LM(f ),\nturn to consider the divisibility of LM(f1 ) by LM(g), where f1 = f \u2212 LT(f ). Since \u227a is a\nwell-ordering, the division process above stops after a finite number of steps and eventually we\nobtain\nP\n\u2217\nf =\ni \u03bbi wi gsi + rf with \u03bbi \u2208 K , wi , si \u2208 B, rf \u2208 \u039b,\nsatisfying LM(wi gsi ) \u0016 LM(f ), LM(rf ) \u0016 LM(f ),\nP\nand if rf = j \u03bcj wj then none of the wj\u2032 s can be divided by LM(g).\n\nThe division procedure of f by g from left-hand side can be performed in a similar way, and\nthe output result is\nf\n\n=\n\nP\n\n\u03bbi wi g + rf with \u03bbi \u2208 K \u2217 , wi \u2208 B, rf \u2208 \u039b,\nsatisfying LM(wi g) \u0016 LM(f ), LM(rf ) \u0016 LM(f ),\nP\nand if rf = j \u03bcj wj then none of the wj\u2032 s can be divided by LM(g).\ni\n\nActually the division procedure above gives rise to an effective division algorithm manipulating the reduction of elements by a subset of \u039b, and thereby leads to the notion of a (left)\nGr\u00f6bner basis.\n\n5\n\n\f1.2. Definition (i) Let (B, \u227a) be an admissible system of the algebra \u039b, and I an ideal of \u039b.\nA subset G \u2282 I is said to be a Gr\u00f6bner basis of I (or a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis of I in case the\nphrase \"two-sided\" is need to be emphasized) if for each nonzero f \u2208 I, there is some g \u2208 G\nsuch that LM(g)|LM(f ), or equivalently, if each nonzero f \u2208 I has a Gr\u00f6bner presentation by\nelements of G, i.e.,\nX\nf =\n\u03bbij wij gj vij with \u03bbij \u2208 K \u2217 , wij , vij \u2208 B, gj \u2208 G, satisfying\ni,j\n\nLM(wij gj vij ) \u0016 LM(f ), and LM(wij \u2217 LM(gj \u2217 )vij \u2217 ) = LM(f ) for some j \u2217 .\n\n(ii) Let (B, \u227a) be a left admissible system of the algebra \u039b, and L a left ideal of \u039b. A subset\nG \u2282 L is said to be a left Gr\u00f6bner basis of L if for each nonzero f \u2208 L, there is some g \u2208 G\nsuch that LM(g)|LM(f ) from left-hand side, or equivalently, if each nonzero f \u2208 L has a left\nGr\u00f6bner presentation by elements of G, i.e.,\nX\nf =\n\u03bbij wij gj with \u03bbij \u2208 K \u2217 , wij \u2208 B, gj \u2208 G, satisfying\ni,j\n\nLM(wij gj ) \u0016 LM(f ), and LM(wij \u2217 LM(gj \u2217 )) = LM(f ) for some j \u2217 .\n\nLet (B, \u227a) be a (left) admissible system of the algebra \u039b. A subset \u03a9 \u2282 B is said to be\nreduced if u, v \u2208 \u03a9 and u 6= v implies u 6 | v. If G is a (left) Gr\u00f6bner basis of a (left) ideal J in\n\u039b such that LM(G) is reduced, then we say that G is LM-reduced. It is easy to see that a (left)\nGr\u00f6bner basis G of a (left) ideal J is LM-reduced if and only if G is a minimal (left) Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis in the sense that any proper subset of G cannot be a (left) Gr\u00f6bner basis for J.\nLet (B, \u227a) be a (left) admissible system of the algebra \u039b. If J is a nonzero (left) ideal of \u039b,\nthen J \u2217 = J \u2212 {0} is trivially a (left) Gr\u00f6bner basis of J. Although we do not know if in general\nthere is an effective way to construct a \"smaller\" (left) Gr\u00f6bner basis for J, the next proposition\ntells us that each (left) ideal of \u039b has a minimal (left) Gr\u00f6bner basis G.\n1.3. Proposition (i) Suppose that the algebra \u039b has an admissible system (B, \u227a). Then each\nideal I of \u039b has a minimal Gr\u00f6bner basis\nG = {g \u2208 I | if g\u2032 \u2208 I and g \u2032 6= g, then LM(g \u2032 ) 6 | LM(g)}.\n(ii) Suppose that the algebra \u039b has a left admissible system (B, \u227a). Then each left ideal L of \u039b\nhas a minimal left Gr\u00f6bner basis\nG = {g \u2208 L | if g\u2032 \u2208 L and g \u2032 6= g, then LM(g \u2032 ) 6 | LM(g)}.\n\u0003\n1.4. Definition Let \u039b be a K-algebra with a skew multiplicative K-basis B. If \u039b has a left,\nrespectively a two-sided admissible system (B, \u227a), then we say that \u039b has a left, respectively a\ntwo-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory.\n6\n\n\fIf \u039b has a left, respectively a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory such that every left, respectively\nevery two-sided ideal has a finite left, respectively a finite two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis, then we say\nthat \u039b has a finite left, respectively a finite two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory.\nSuppose that the algebra \u039b has a (left, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory in the sense of\nDefinition 1.4, and let J be a (left, or two-sided) monomial ideal of \u039b, i.e., J is generated by a\nsubset \u03a9 \u2282 B. Since B is a skew multiplicative K-basis, J behaves exactly like a monomial ideal\nin a commutative polynomial algebra, that is, u \u2208 B \u2229 J if and only if there exists some v \u2208 \u03a9\nP\nsuch that v|u; and for an element f = i \u03bbi ui \u2208 \u039b with \u03bbi \u2208 K \u2217 , ui \u2208 B, f \u2208 J if and only if\nall ui \u2208 J, the Gr\u00f6bner basis theory of \u039b is featured as follows.\n1.5. Proposition (i) Suppose that the algebra \u039b has a left Gr\u00f6bner basis theory, and let L be a\nleft ideal of \u039b. A subset G \u2282 L is a left Gr\u00f6bner basis of L if and only if \u039b hLM(L)i = \u039b hLM(G)i\nwhere both sides of the equality are left ideals generated by LM(L), respectively by LM(G); L\nhas a finite left Gr\u00f6bner basis basis if and only if \u039b hLM(L)i has a finite monomial generating\nset.\n(ii) Suppose that the algebra \u039b has a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory, and let I be an ideal of\n\u039b. A subset G \u2282 I is a Gr\u00f6bner basis of I if and only if hLM(I)i = hLM(G)i; I has a finite\nGr\u00f6bner basis if and only if hLM(I)i has a finite monomial generating set.\n\u0003\nFinally, if a K-algebra \u039b has a (left) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory in the sense of Definition 1.4,\nthen the fundamental decomposition theorem holds, that is, if I is a (left) ideal of \u039b, then the\nK-vector space \u039b is decomposed into a direct sum of two subspaces:\n\u039b = I \u2295 K-spanN (I),\nwhere N (I) = {u | u \u2208 B, LM(f ) 6 | u, f \u2208 I} is the set of normal monomials in B (modulo I).\nIn the case that I is generated by a (left) Gr\u00f6bner basis G, N (I) can be obtained by means of\nthe (left) division algorithm by LM(G).\nRemark Let \u039b be a K-algebra with a skew multiplicative K-basis B. To end this section, it is\nnecessary to note the following:\n(i) A right Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for right ideals in \u039b can be stated in a similar way.\n(ii) From Definition 1.1 it is clear that if the K-basis B of \u039b contains the identity element 1,\nthen any two-sided monomial ordering on B is also a one-sided (i.e. left or right) monomial\nordering, and thereby a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for \u039b is certainly a one-sided Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis theory for \u039b. But conversely, in the next section we will see the examples showing that a\none-sided monomial ordering is not necessarily a two-sided monomial ordering (note that such\na proper example has been missing on page 35 of [Li1]).\n\n7\n\n\f2. Some Motivating Results\nLet R = K[a1 , ..., an ] be a K-algebra generated by {a1 , ..., an }. Assume that R has a twosided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory with respect to a two-sided admissible system (B, \u227a) in the sense\nof Definition 1.4, where B is a skew multiplicative K-basis of R and \u227a is a two-sided monomial\nordering on B. For instance, R is a commutative polynomial algebra, a free algebra, a path\nalgebra, or the multiparameter quantized coordinate ring of affine n-space KQ [z1 , ..., zn ] with\nthe parameter matrix Q as described in the beginning of Section 1. In this section, firstly we\nconsider the quotient algebra R/I of R, where I is an ideal generated by monomials and binomials\nof certain special types, and we demonstrate respectively the existence of a left Gr\u00f6bner basis\ntheory for a subclass of such algebras that may not necessarily have a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis\ntheory, the existence of a right Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for a subclass of such algebras that may\nnot necessarily have a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory, as well as the existence of a two-sided\nGr\u00f6bner basis theory for a subclass of such algebras; and then, in the case where R = \u2295\u03b3\u2208\u0393 R\u03b3\nis a \u0393-graded algebra by an ordered semigroup \u0393 which is ordered by a well-ordering, for an\narbitrary ideal I of R, we apply the foregoing results to the \u0393-leading homogeneous algebra\nA\u0393LH = R/hLH(I)i of A (see the definition given before Proposition 2.6); moreover, we show\nthat if A\u0393LH is a domain, then a (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory of A\u0393LH may be\nlifted to a (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for A. Here and in what follows, with\nrespect to a skew multiplicative K-basis, a one-sided or two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory always\nmeans the one in the sense of Definition 1.4, otherwise it is the one indicated before Theorem\n2.10.\nLet I be an ideal of R, and A = R/I. Since R has a Gr\u00f6bner basis theory, under the\ncanonical algebra epimorphism \u03c0: R \u2192 A, the set N (I) of normal monomials in B (modulo I)\nprojects to a K-basis of A, that is {\u016b = u + I | u \u2208 N (I)} (see Section 1). In what follows we\nuse N (I) to denote this basis.\nOur first result is to deal with monomial ideals, i.e., ideals generated by elements of B.\n2.1. Proposition Let R and (B, \u227a) be as fixed above. Consider a subset \u03a9 \u2282 B (where 1 6\u2208 \u03a9\nif 1 \u2208 B) and the ideal I = h\u03a9i in R. The following statements hold.\n(i) N (I) is a skew multiplicative K-basis for the quotient algebra A = R/I.\n(ii) The two-sided monomial ordering \u227a on B induces a two-sided monomial ordering on N (I),\nagain denoted \u227a, and hence the quotient A = R/I has a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory.\nProof (i) Since B is a skew multiplicative K-basis of R, it follows from the remark made\npreceding Proposition 1.6 that that u \u2208 B \u2229 I if and only if there is some v \u2208 \u03a9 such that v|u,\ni.e., u = \u03bbwvs with \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 and w, s \u2208 B. So, suppose u1 , u2 \u2208 N (I) and u1 u2 6= 0, then\nu1 u2 = \u03bcv with \u03bc \u2208 K \u2217 and v \u2208 N (I). Hence u1 u2 = \u03bcv. This shows that N (I) is a skew\nmultiplicative K-basis for A.\n\n8\n\n\f(ii) Suppose \u016b, v\u0304 \u2208 N (I) such that \u016b \u227a v\u0304. Then u \u227a v since we are using the induced ordering\n\u227a on N (I). If w\u0304, s\u0304 \u2208 N (I) such that LM(w\u0304\u016bs\u0304) 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0} and LM(w\u0304v\u0304s\u0304) 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0},\nthen w\u0304\u016bs\u0304 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0}, w\u0304v\u0304s\u0304 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0}, and as argued in the proof of (i) above, there are\nu\u2032 , v \u2032 \u2208 N (I) such that wus = \u03bbu\u2032 and wvs = \u03bcv \u2032 , where \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 K \u2217 . Hence, it follows from\nLM(wus) = u\u2032 \u227a v \u2032 = LM(wvs) that LM(w\u0304\u016bs\u0304) = u\u2032 \u227a v \u2032 = LM(w\u0304v\u0304s\u0304). This shows that\n(MO1) of Definition 1.1 holds. To prove that (MO2) of Definition 1.1 holds as well, suppose\n\u016b, v\u0304, w\u0304, s\u0304 \u2208 N (I) such that \u016b = LM(w\u0304v\u0304s\u0304) (where w\u0304 6= 1 or s\u0304 6= 1 if 1 \u2208 B, and thereby w 6= 1\nor s 6= 1 by the choice of \u03a9), and wvs = \u03bbv \u2032 with \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 and v \u2032 \u2208 N (I). Thus, v \u2032 = LM(wvs)\nimplies v \u227a v \u2032 , and consequently, v\u0304 \u227a v \u2032 = LM(w\u0304v\u0304s\u0304) = \u016b, as desired.\n\u0003\nNext we show that there is a left Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for a class of algebras defined by\nmonomials and binomials of certain special type.\n2.2. Theorem Let R and (B, \u227a) be as fixed above. Suppose that the skew multiplicative\nK-basis B contains every monomial of the form a\u03b1l11 a\u03b1l22 * * * a\u03b1lnn with respect to some permutation\nal1 , al2 , ..., aln of a1 , a2 , ..., an , where \u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n \u2208 N. If G = \u03a9 \u222a G is a minimal Gr\u00f6bner basis of\nelements\nthe ideal I = hGi, where \u03a9 \u2282 B and G consists of n(n\u22121)\n2\ngji = alj ali \u2212 \u03bbji ali alp , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, i < p \u2264 n, \u03bbji \u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0},\nsuch that LM(gji ) = alj ali , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, then the following statements hold for the algebra\nA = R/I.\n(i) N (I) \u2286 {a\u03b1l11 a\u03b1l22 * * * a\u03b1lnn | \u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n \u2208 N}, and N (I) is a skew multiplicative K-basis for A.\n(ii) Let \u227aI denote the ordering on N (I), which is induced by the lexicographic ordering or the\nN-graded lexicographic ordering on Nn , such that\naln \u227aI aln\u22121 \u227aI * * * \u227aI al2 \u227aI al1 .\nIf al1 \u03b11 al2 \u03b12 * * * aln \u03b1n 6= 0 implies a\u03b1l11 a\u03b1l22 * * * a\u03b1lnn \u2208 N (I), then \u227aI is a left monomial ordering on\nN (I), and hence A has a left Gr\u00f6bner basis theory with respect to the left admissible system\n(N (I), \u227aI ).\nProof Note that for the convenience of statement, we may assume, without loss of generality,\nthat al1 = a1 , al2 = a2 , ..., aln = an .\n(i) By the assumptions, B is a skew multiplicative K-basis of R, a1 , ..., an \u2208 B, and\nLM(gji ) = aj ai , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n. It follows from the division algorithm by G that\nN (I) \u2286 {a\u03b11 1 a\u03b12 2 * * * a\u03b1nn | \u03b1j \u2208 N}. For \u016b, v\u0304 \u2208 N (I), if \u016bv\u0304 6= 0, then uv 6= 0 and uv = \u03bbw\nfor some \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 and w \u2208 B. If w \u2208 N (I), then \u016bv\u0304 = \u03bbw\u0304; otherwise, noticing that G consists\nof monomials and binomials, the division of the monomial w by G yields a unique Gr\u00f6bner\npresentation (see Definition 1.2):\nX\nw=\n\u03bcij sij gji tij + \u03b7u\u2032 , where \u03bcij , \u03b7 \u2208 K \u2217 , sij , tij \u2208 B, u\u2032 \u2208 N (I),\ni,j\n\n9\n\n\fand consequently \u016bv\u0304 = \u03bbw\u0304 = (\u03bb\u03b7)u\u2032 . Therefore, N (I) is a skew multiplicative K-basis for the\nquotient algebra A = R/I.\n(ii) Let \u227aI be one of the orderings on N (I) as mentioned in the theorem, that is, \u227aI is defined\nsubject to the lexicographic ordering\nan \u227aI an\u22121 \u227aI * * * \u227aI a2 \u227aI a1\nIf \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n ) \u2208 Nn , then we write |\u03b1| = \u03b11 + * * * + \u03b1n .\nFirst note that if ak \u2208 {a1 , a2 , ..., an } and if ak * ai \u03b1i 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0}, then\n\uf8f1\n\u03b1i +1 ,\nk=i\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 ai\n\u03b1i\n\u03b1\ni\n(1)\nLM(ak * ai ) =\nak * ai ,\nk<i\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03b1i\nai * apk with i < pk , k > i\n\nLet \u016b = a1 \u03b11 * * * an \u03b1n , v\u0304 = a1 \u03b21 * * * an \u03b2n \u2208 N (I) be such that \u016b \u227aI v\u0304.

It follows from the foregoing formula (1)\nthat |\u03b7| = |\u03b1| + |\u03b3|, |\u03c1| = |\u03b2| + |\u03b3|. Thus, |\u03b1| < |\u03b2| implies |\u03b7| < |\u03c1|, and hence\nLM(s\u0304 * \u016b) \u227aI LM(s\u0304 * v\u0304)\n\n(3)\n\nprovided we are using the graded lexicographic ordering. In the case that |\u03b1| = |\u03b2|, we have\n\u03b11 = \u03b21 , ..., \u03b1i\u22121 = \u03b2i\u22121 and \u03b1i < \u03b2i for some i by the indication (2) given above.

This turns out that\nLM(s\u0304 * \u016b) = LM(a1 \u03c41 * * * ai \u03c4i * ai \u03b1i * api+1 \u03c4i+1 * * * apn \u03c4n * ai+1 \u03b1i+1 * * * an \u03b1n ),\nLM(s\u0304 * v\u0304) = LM(a1 \u03c41 * * * ai \u03c4i * ai \u03b2i * api+1 \u03c4i+1 * * * apn \u03c4n * ai+1 \u03b2i+1 * * * an \u03b2n ).\nHence we obtain\n(4)\n\nLM(s\u0304 * \u016b) \u227aI LM(s\u0304 * v\u0304)\n\nThis shows that (LMO1) of Definition 1.1(ii) holds.\n\n10\n\n\fNext, let \u016b = a1 \u03b11 * * * an \u03b1n , v\u0304 = a1 \u03b21 * * * an \u03b2n , w\u0304 = a1 \u03b31 * * * an \u03b3n \u2208 N (I) be such that \u016b =\nLM(v\u0304 * w\u0304) (where v\u0304 6= 1 if 1 \u2208 B). If \u016b \u0016I w\u0304, then since (LMO1) holds, we would have\nLM(v\u0304 * \u016b) \u0016I LM(v\u0304 * w\u0304) = \u016b. But then, from the argument given before the formula (3) above\nwe would have |\u03b2| + |\u03b1| \u2264 |\u03b2| + |\u03b3| = |\u03b1|, that is clearly impossible, for, v\u0304 6= 0 (also v\u0304 6= 1 if\n1 \u2208 B) implies |\u03b2| =\n6 0. So we must have w\u0304 \u227aI \u016b. It follows that (LMO2) of Definition 1.1(ii)\nholds as well. Summing up, we conclude that \u227aI is a left monomial ordering on N (I), and\nthereby A has a left Gr\u00f6bner basis theory with respect to the left admissible system (N (I), \u227aI ).\n\u0003\nIn a similar way, we may obtain a right Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for a class of algebras defined\nby monomials and binomials of certain special type.\n2.3.

Thus, for a subset S \u2282 R we write\nLH(S) = {LH(f ) | f \u2208 S} for the set of \u0393-leading homogeneous elements of S. If I is an ideal\nof R and A = R/I, then the \u0393-leading homogeneous algebra of A defined in [Li2] is the \u0393-graded\nalgebra A\u0393LH (A) = R/hLH(I)i.

The existence of a Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for the algebras A = KhXi/I and AN\nLH =\nKhXi/hLH(G)i is discussed as follows.\n(1) If \u03bb 6= 0 and \u03c9 6= 0, then, in any case (i.e., d(f ) \u2264 2 or d(f ) \u2265 3), with respect to\n[\nc2 \u227agrlex X\nc1 \u227agrlex X\nc3 on N\nX2 \u227agrlex X1 \u227agrlex X3 on N (I), respectively X\n(I), both A and AN\nLH\nare solvable polynomial algebras in the sense of [K-RW]. Hence, every (left, right, or two-sided)\nideal has a finite Gr\u00f6bner basis.\n(2) If d(f ) \u2265 3 and \u03bb = 0 or \u03c9 = 0, then by Theorem 2.9, AN\nLH has a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner\n[\nbasis theory with respect to the admissible system (N (I), \u227aLH(I) ), where \u227aLH(I) is the monomial\nordering as described in Theorem 2.9.\n(3) In the case that f (X1 ) = aX12 + bX1 + c = 0, if a = 0, then, for arbitrary \u03bb and \u03c9, AN\nLH has\n[\na two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory with respect to the admissible system (N (I), \u227aLH(I) ), where\n\u227aLH(I) is the monomial ordering as described in Theorem 2.9.\n(4) In the case that f (X1 ) = aX12 + bX1 + c = 0, if a 6= 0 and \u03bb = 0 or \u03c9 = 0, then we are not\nclear about the existence of a (left, right, or two-sided) gr\u00f6bner basis for AN\nLH .\n2\n(5) If \u03bb = 0 and \u03b3 6= 0, then, in any case (i.e., d(f ) \u2264 2 or d(f ) \u2265 3), note that X1 , X1 ,\n2\n2\nX3 \u2208 N (I), X1 6= X1 , X3 * X1 = \u2212\u03b3X3 , and X3 * X1 = \u03b3 2 X3 .

If \u03bb, \u03c9 are roots of the\nequation x2 \u2212 \u03b1x \u2212 \u03b2 = 0, then since \u03bb + \u03c9 = \u03b1, \u2212\u03bb\u03c9 = \u03b2, it follows from [KMP], [CM] and\n[CS] that all down-up algebras A(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) in the sense of [Ben], are recaptured by the quadric\ndefining relations\ng31 = X3 X1 \u2212 \u03bbX1 X3 + \u03b3X3 ,\ng12 = X1 X2 \u2212 \u03bbX2 X1 + \u03b3X2 ,\ng32 = X3 X2 \u2212 \u03c9X2 X3 + X1 .\nIn addition to the effectiveness of studying A via a Gr\u00f6bner basis theory of A\u0393LH (as may be\nseen from [Li2]), the natural question is now to ask if there would be any appropriate condition\non A or on A\u0393LH that enables us to obtain a Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for A subject to a Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis theory of A\u0393LH .\nEnlightened by ([Li2], Theorem 1.1), the next theorem, which may be viewed as a recognizable version of ([Li1], CH.IV, Theorem 1.6), provides a solution to the question posed above.\nBefore mentioning the next theorem, we need a little more preparation, for, the ideal I concerned by the theorem is not necessarily generated by monomials and binomials, and moreover,\n[\nthe K-basis N (I) of A = R/I, respectively the K-basis N\n(I) of A\u0393LH , is not necessarily a skew\nmultiplicative K-basis. In this case, with any fixed K-basis B of A, the definition of a (left,\nright, or two-sided) monomial ordering \u227a on B is the same as that defined in Definition 1.1; for\nu, v \u2208 B, we say that u divides v, denoted u|v, if there are w, s \u2208 B such that v = LM(wus);\nand we say that A has a (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory (comparing with Definition 1.4) if, with respect to the (left, right, or two-sided) admissible system (B, \u227a), every\nproper (left, right, or two-sided) ideal I of A has a generating set G such that f \u2208 I implies\nLM(g)|LM(f ) for some g \u2208 G. Similar convention is valid for A\u0393LH .\n2.10. Theorem Let R = \u2295\u03b3\u2208\u0393 R\u03b3 and (B, \u227agr ) be as in Proposition 2.6, and let I be an\narbitrary proper ideal of R (i.e., I is not necessarily generated by monomials and binomials).\nPut A = R/I, A\u0393LH = R/hLH(I)i. With notation as before and the convention made above,\nsuppose that\n(a) A\u0393LH is a domain; and\n(b) A\u0393LH has a (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory with respect to some (left, right,\n[\nor two-sided) admissible system (N\n(I), \u227agr\nb ), where \u227agr\nb is a \u0393-graded (left, right, or two[\nsided) monomial ordering on N (I), such that every \u0393-graded (left, right, or two-sided) ideal\nof A\u0393LH has a (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis consisting of \u0393-homogeneous elements.\nThen the order \u227a on N (I) defined subject to the rule: for u, v \u2208 N (I),\n\u016b \u227a v\u0304 whenever \u00fb \u227agr\nb v\u0302,\n21\n\n\fis a (left, right, or two-sided) monomial ordering on N (I), such that every (left, right, or twosided) ideal of A has a (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis.\nProof Note that it is not difficult to check that if R has a left or right Gr\u00f6bner basis theory with\nrespect to some left or right \u0393-graded monomial ordering on B, then an analogue of Proposition\n2.6 holds for a left or right ideal. The proof given below will show that it is enough to conclude\nthat A has a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory whenever A\u0393LH has a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory.\nSince \u227a is clearly a well-ordering on N (I), we show first that \u227a satisfies the axioms (MO1)\n\u2013 (MO2) of Definition 1.1(i). We start by finding the relation between LM(f\u02c6 ) and LM(f \u0304 ) for\na nonzero f \u2208 R, where f\u02c6 = f + hLH(I)i \u2208 A\u0393LH , f \u0304 = f + I \u2208 A. First note that I \u2217 = I \u2212 {0} is\ntrivially a Gr\u00f6bner basis of I, and hence LH(I \u2217 ) is a Gr\u00f6bner basis for hLH(I)i by Proposition\n2.6(ii). Thus, writing f = LH(f ) + f \u2032 with d(f \u2032 ) < d(f ) = d(LH(f )) and noticing that \u227agr is\na \u0393-graded monomial ordering on B, the division by LH(I \u2217 ) turns out that the homogeneous\nelement LH(f ) has a Gr\u00f6bner presentation (Definition 1.2):\nX\n\nLH(f ) =\n\nX\n\u03bbl ul with \u03bbij \u2208 K \u2217 , \u03bbl \u2208 K, wij , vij \u2208 B, fj \u2208 I \u2217 ,\n\n\u03bbij wij LH(fj )vij +\n\ni,j\n\nl\n\nwhere if \u03bbl 6= 0 then ul \u2208 N (hLH(I)i) = N (I), d(ul ) = d(LH(f )) = d(f ),\nand that if f \u2032 6= 0 then f \u2032 has a Gr\u00f6bner presentation\nX\nX\nf\u2032 =\n\u03bbpq wpq LH(fq )vpq +\n\u03bbh uh with \u03bbpq \u2208 K \u2217 , \u03bbh \u2208 K, wpq , vpq \u2208 B, fq \u2208 I \u2217 ,\np,q\n\nh\n\nwhere if \u03bbh 6= 0 then uh \u2208 N (hLH(I)i) = N (I), d(uh ) < d(LH(f )) = d(f ).\n\nConsequently,\nX\n\nf = LH(f ) + f \u2032 =\n\n\u03bbij wij LH(fj )vij +\n\np,q\n\ni,j\n\n+\n\nX\n\u03bbpq wpq LH(fq )vpq\n\nX\n\n\u03bbl ul +\n\nd(ul )=d(f )\n\nX\n\n\u03bbh uh .\n\nd(uh )<d(f )\n\nIf we write each fj appearing in the presentation of LH(f ) obtained above as fj = LH(fj ) + fj\u2032\nwith d(fj\u2032 ) < d(fj ), then, since \u0393 is an ordered semigroup, f has a presentation\nf\n\n=\n\nX\nX\nX\n\u03bbij wij fj\u2032 vij +\n\u03bbij wij fj vij + f \u2032 \u2212\n\u03bbl ul satisfying\ni,j\n\n\uf8eb\n\nd \uf8edf \u2032 \u2212\n\nij\n\nX\nij\n\nl\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03bbij wij fj\u2032 vij \uf8f8 < d(f ), ul \u2208 N (hLH(I)i) = N (I) and d(ul ) = d(f ).\n\nIf furthermore we do division by I \u2217 with respect to \u227agr , then the remainder of f \u2032 \u2212\n\nX\n\u03bbij wij fj\u2032 vij\nij\n\nmust have degree < d(f ). Summing up, recalling that the \u0393-gradation of A\u0393LH is the one induced\n22\n\n\fby the \u0393-gradation of R, and that the order \u227a on N (I) is defined subject to the \u0393-graded\n[\nmonomial ordering \u227agr\nb on N (I), we are now able to conclude that if LH(f ) 6\u2208 hLH(I)i, or\n\\) 6= 0, then\nequivalently, if LH(f\nLM(f\u02c6 ) = \u00fb implies LM(f \u0304 ) = \u016b, where u \u2208 N (I).\n\n(1)\n\nNext, for \u016b, v\u0304, w\u0304, s\u0304 \u2208 N (I), suppose \u016b \u227a v\u0304, LM(w\u0304\u016bs\u0304) 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0} and LM(w\u0304v\u0304s\u0304) 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0}.\n\u2217\nThen \u00fb \u227agr\nb v\u0302 by the definition of \u227a. Also we conclude that LM(\u0175\u00fb\u015d) 6\u2208 K \u222a {0}, LM(\u0175v\u0302\u015d) 6\u2208\nK \u2217 \u222a {0}, and hence\nLM(wus)\nd = LM(\u0175\u00fb\u015d) \u227agr\nd\nb LM(\u0175v\u0302\u015d) = LM(wvs).\n\n(2)\n\nTo see this, put f = wus, g = wvs. Then, noticing that w, u, v, s \u2208 B are \u0393-homogeneous\n\\) = wus\nelements of R, we have f = LH(f ) = wus, g = LH(g) = wvs, and thereby f\u02c6 = LH(f\nd 6=\n\u0393\n\\\n\u02c6\n0, \u011d = LH(g) = wvs\nd 6= 0, since ALH is a domain by the assumption (a). Let LM(f ) = c\nu1 and\nLM(\u011d ) = vb1 with u1 , v1 \u2208 N (I). Then it follows from the assertion (1) above that\nu1 = LM(f \u0304 ) = LM(wus) = LM(w\u0304\u016bs\u0304),\nv1 = LM(\u1e21 ) = LM(wvs) = LM(w\u0304v\u0304s\u0304).\n\n(3)\n\nThus LM(\u0175\u00fb\u015d) 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0}, LM(\u0175v\u0302\u015d) 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u222a {0} and (2) follows. Consequently, (2) + (3)\ngives rise to\nLM(w\u0304\u016bs\u0304) = u1 \u227a v1 = LM(w\u0304v\u0304s\u0304).\nThis proves that \u227a satisfies (MO1). It remains to show that \u227a satisfies (MO2) as well. Suppose\nthat \u016b, w\u0304, v\u0304, s\u0304 \u2208 N (I) satisfy \u016b = LM(w\u0304v\u0304s\u0304) (where w\u0304 6= 1\u0304 or s\u0304 6= 1\u0304 if 1 \u2208 B, hence w 6= 1\n[\nor s 6= 1 in N (I) and \u0175 6= 1\u0302 or \u015d 6= 1\u0302 in N\n(I)). Since A\u0393LH is a domain, LM(\u0175v\u0302\u015d) 6= 0.\nSo, if LM(\u0175v\u0302\u015d) = LM(wvs)\nd = vb1 with v1 \u2208 N (I), then, as argued above, it follows from the\nforegoing assertion (1) that \u016b = LM(w\u0304v\u0304s\u0304) = LM(wvs) = v1 . Thus, v\u0302 \u227agr\nb vb1 implies that v\u0304 \u227a \u016b,\nas desired.\nFinally, we prove that if J = J/I is a proper ideal of A = R/I, where J is an ideal of R\ncontaining I, then J has a Gr\u00f6bner basis G with respect to the admissible system (\u227a, N (I))\nobtained above. To this end, let us note first that if f \u2208 R \u2212 I, then since \u0393 is ordered by a wellordering and hLH(I)i is a \u0393-graded ideal of R, there is some f \u2032 \u2208 R such that LH(f \u2032 ) 6\u2208 hLH(I)i\nand f \u0304 = f \u2032 . So, without loss of generality, we may always assume that\nf \u2208 R \u2212 I implies LH(f ) 6\u2208 hLH(I)i.\n\n(4)\n\nConsequently, since the \u0393-gradation of A\u0393LH is induced by the \u0393-gradation of R, and since \u227agr\nb\n[\nis a \u0393-graded monomial ordering on N\n(I), if we write f = LH(f ) + f1 then\n\\),\nLH(f\u02c6) = LH(f\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\\) .\nLM(f\u02c6) = LM(LH(f\u02c6)) = LM LH(f\n23\n\n(5)\n\n\fNow, noticing that LH(I) \u2282 LH(J) and thus Jb = hLH(J)i/hLH(I)i is a \u0393-graded ideal of\nA\u0393LH , by Proposition 1.5 and Proposition 2.6(i), Jb 6= A\u0393LH . Hence, with respect to the data\n[\nb\n(N\n(I), \u227agr\nb ), J has a Gr\u00f6bner basis G consisting of \u0393-homogeneous elements. Once again since\n\\ = {LH(h)\n\\ | h \u2208 J}\nthe \u0393-gradation of A\u0393LH is induced by the \u0393-gradation of R, and thus LH(J)\nis a generating set of Jb consisting of \u0393-homogeneous elements, it is straightforward to check (or\n\\ Hence there is a subset G \u2282 J \u2212 I such\nsee Lemma 4.2 in later Section 4) that G \u2282 LH(J).\n\\ = G . Put G = {\u1e21 | g \u2208 G}. If f \u0304 \u2208 J \u2212 {0}, then by the previous (4) and (5),\nthat LH(G)\n\\\nthere is some g \u2208 G such that LM(LH(g))|LM(\nf \u0304), and consequently LM(\u011d)|LM(f\u02c6), i.e., there\n[\nare \u00fb, v\u0302 \u2208 N\n(I) such that LM(f\u02c6) = LM(\u00fbLM(\u011d)v\u0302). It follows from the foregoing (1) and the\nargument given before the formula (3) that\nLM(f \u0304) = LM(\u016bLM(\u1e21)v\u0304).\nThis shows that G is a Gr\u00f6bner basis for J.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark From the proof given above it is clear that if every \u0393-graded (left, right, or two-sided)\nideal of A\u0393LH has a finite (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis consisting of \u0393-homogeneous\nelements. Then every (left, right, or two-sided) ideal of A has a finite (left, right, or two-sided)\nGr\u00f6bner basis.\nThere are examples of algebras other than algebras of the solvable type in the sense of [K-RW]\nto illustrate Theorem 2.10.\nExample (8) If in Corollary 2.5(i) \u2013 (ii) we have \u03a9 = \u2205 and all the \u03bbji 6= 0, then it follows\nfrom the proof of Theorem 2.2 (also a similar proof of Theorem 2.3, though it is not mentioned\nthere) that the quadratic algebra considered in (i) \u2013 (ii) respectively is a domain. Hence, by\nProposition 2.6, if G is a Gr\u00f6bner basis of the ideal I = hGi in KhX1 , ..., Xn i such that LH(G) is\nof the form as described in Corollary 2.5(i) \u2013 (ii) respectively but with \u03a9 = \u2205 and all the \u03bbji 6= 0,\nthen the quotient algebra KhX1 , ..., Xn i/I will provide us with a practical algebra required by\nTheorem 2.10. Omitting tedious verification, we list a family of the desired Gr\u00f6bner bases G in\nKhX1 , X2 , X3 , X4 i consisting of\ng43 = X4 X3 \u2212 \u03bb43 X3 X4 \u2212 \u03b1X2 , g32 = X3 X2 \u2212 \u03bb32 X2 X3 \u2212 \u03b3X4 ,\ng42 = X4 X2 \u2212 \u03bb42 X2 X4 + \u03b2X3 , g31 = X3 X1 \u2212 \u03bb31 X1 X4 ,\ng41 = X4 X1 \u2212 \u03bb41 X1 X2 ,\ng21 = X2 X1 \u2212 \u03bb21 X1 X3 ,\nwhere \u03bbji , \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 K \u2217 satisfying\n\u03bb21 \u03b1 = \u03b2, \u03bb31 \u03b2 = \u03b3, \u03bb41 \u03b3 = \u03b1,\n\u03bb43 \u03bb42 = 1, \u03bb43 = \u03bb32 ,\nand the monomial ordering used here is the N-graded lexicographic monomial ordering \u227agrlex\nwith respect to d(Xi ) = 1, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4, such that X1 \u227agrlex X2 \u227agrlex X3 \u227agrlex X4 .\n24\n\n\f3. Skew 2-nomial Algebras\nIn Section 2 we have listed some practical algebras (including numerous quantum binomial\nalgebras in the sense of [Laf] and [G-I2]) defined by elements of the form u \u2212 \u03bbv and w, where\nu, v, w are monomials and \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 , which are not the familiar types of algebras manipulated\nby classical Gr\u00f6bner basis theory, such as the Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for solvable polynomial\nalgebras or their homomorphic images ([AL], [K-RW], [HT], [BGV], [Lev]), but may hold a left\nGr\u00f6bner basis theory or a right Gr\u00f6bner basis theory. Inspired by such a fact, we introduce more\ngeneral skew 2-nomial algebras in this section, and, as the first step of having a (one-sided or\ntwo-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory, we establish the existence of a skew multiplicative K-basis for\nsuch algebras. As to the existence of a (one-sided or two-sided) monomial ordering, examples\nof Section 2 have told us that it has to be a matter of examining concrete individual class of\nalgebras.\nThroughout the current section R denotes a K-algebra with a skew multiplicative K-basis B.\nMoreover, here and in what follows, with respect to a skew multiplicative K-basis, a one-sided\nor two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory means the one in the sense of Definition 1.4. All notations\nused before are maintained.\nWe start by generalizing the sufficiency result of ([Gr2], Theorem 2.3). Let I be an arbitrary\nideal of R. Then we may define a relation \u223cI on B \u222a {0} as follows: if v, u \u2208 B \u222a {0}, then\nv \u223cI u \u21d0\u21d2 \u2203 \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 such that v \u2212 \u03bbu \u2208 I.\n3.1. Lemma \u223c is an equivalence relation on B \u222a {0}.\nProof Note that K is a field, and v \u2208 I if and only if v \u223cI 0. The verification of reflexivity,\nsymmetry, and transitivity for \u223cI is straightforward.\n\u0003\nRecall that elements of B are called monomials. If h = v \u2212 \u03bbu \u2208 R with v, u \u2208 B and \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 ,\nthen we call h a skew 2-nomial in R; and thus we call the equivalence relation \u223cI obtained above\na skew 2-nomial relation on B \u222a {0} determined by the ideal I.\n3.2. Definition An ideal I of R is said to be a skew 2-nomial ideal if I is generated by monomials\nand skew 2-nomials. If I is a skew 2-nomial ideal of R, then we call the corresponding quotient\nalgebra A = R/I a skew 2-nomial algebra.\nRemark Instead of comparing to other references, for instance [GI-1], [Laf], or [ES] in the\ncommutative case, we used the phrase \"skew 2-nomial ideal\" just for differing from the phrase\n\"2-nomial ideal\" used in [Gr2] (see a remark given after Theorem 3.4).\n3.3. Lemma Let I be a skew 2-nomial ideal of R and \u223cI the skew 2-nomial relation on B \u222a {0}\nP\ndetermined by I. If f = j \u03bbj wj with \u03bbj \u2208 K \u2217 and wj \u2208 B, then f \u2208 I if and only if for each\n25\n\n\fP\n\nequivalence class [w] of \u223cI ,\n\nwj \u2208[w] \u03bbj wj\n\n\u2208 I.\n\nP\nProof The sufficiency is clear. To get the necessity, suppose f = j \u03bbj wj \u2208 I. Then since B is\na skew multiplicative K-basis and I is an ideal, f has a presentation of the form\nf=\n\nX\nX\nX\n\u03bbj wj =\n\u03bcp (vp \u2212 \u03b3p up ) +\n\u03b7q sq\np\n\nj\n\nq\n\nwith vp \u2212 \u03b3p up , sq \u2208 I, \u03bcp , \u03b3p , \u03b7q \u2208 K \u2217 ,\nbut vp , up 6\u2208 I for every p.\n\nNote that for v, s \u2208 B, if s \u2208 I but v 6\u2208 I, then v 6\u223cI s. So, comparing both sides of the above\nequality subject to the equivalence relation \u223cI , if [w] is any equivalence class of \u223cI , then\neither\n\nX\n\n\u03bbj wj =\n\nX\n\n\u03bbj wj =\n\nwj \u2208[w]\n\nor\n\nX\n\n\u03bcp (vp \u2212 \u03b3p up ) \u2208 I,\n\nvp ,up \u2208[w]\n\nwj \u2208[w]\n\nX\n\n\u03b7q sq \u2208 I,\n\nsq \u2208[w]\n\nas wanted.\n\n\u0003\n\nTo make use of unified notation as before, if I is an ideal of R and \u03c0: R \u2192 R/I is the\ncanonical surjection, then, for f \u2208 R, in what follows we write f \u0304 for the canonical image of f in\nR/I, i.e., f \u0304 = f + I.\n3.4. Theorem Let I be a skew 2-nomial ideal of R, A = R/I, and let \u223cI be the skew 2-nomial\nrelation on B\u222a{0} determined by I. Considering the image B of B under the canonical surjection\n\u2217\n\u03c0: R \u2192 A, if we put B = B \u2212 {0}, then the following statements hold.\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(i) With respect to the inclusion order on subsets of B , B contains a maximal subset, denoted\n\u2217\nB\u223cI , with the property that\n\u2217\n\nu1 , u2 \u2208 B\u223cI , u1 6= u2 implies u1 6\u223cI u2 .\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n(ii) The maximal subset B \u223cI of B obtained in (i) above forms a skew multiplicative K-basis\nfor the skew 2-nomial algebra A.\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nProof (i) The existence of B \u223cI with respect to the inclusion order on subsets of B follows from\nZorn's Lemma.\n(ii) Since B is a skew multiplicative K-basis of R, if u, v \u2208 B, then either uv = 0 or uv = \u03bbw for\n\u2217\nsome \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 , w \u2208 B. Hence, for \u016b, v\u0304 \u2208 B \u223cI , either \u016bv\u0304 = 0, or \u016bv\u0304 6= 0 and so \u016bv\u0304 = uv = \u03bbw\u0304 with\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 and w\u0304 \u2208 B . If w\u0304 6\u2208 B\u223cI , then by the definition of B\u223cI , there is some s\u0304 \u2208 B \u223cI such that\ns \u223cI w. Consequently w\u0304 = \u03bcs\u0304 for some \u03bc \u2208 K \u2217 and thereby \u016bv\u0304 = \u03bb\u03bcs\u0304 with \u03bb\u03bc \u2208 K \u2217 . Thus,\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthe skew multiplication property of B\u223cI is proved. Furthermore, we proceed to show that B \u223cI\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nforms a K-basis of A. Again by the definition of B\u223cI , if w\u0304 \u2208 B and w\u0304 6\u2208 B \u223cI , then w\u0304 = \u03bbv\u0304 for\n26\n\n\f\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nsome \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 and v\u0304 \u2208 B\u223cI . It follows that B \u223cI spans A. To see that elements of B\u223cI are linearly\nP\nindependent over K, suppose that lj=1 \u03bbj wj = 0 and that the wj are distinct, where \u03bbj \u2208 K\nP\nP\n\u2217\nand wj \u2208 B\u223cI . Then f = lj=1 \u03bbj wj \u2208 I. By Lemma 3.3, wj \u2208[u] \u03bbj wj \u2208 I holds for every\nequivalence class [u] of \u223cI . But wj \u2208 [u] implies wj \u223cI u. Noticing that \u223cI is an equivalence\n\u2217\nrelation and that all the wj are distinct, it follows from the definition of B \u223cI that different wj 's\nare contained in different equivalence classes. So \u03bbj wj \u2208 I and \u03bbj wj = 0. Since wj 6= 0, it turns\nout that \u03bbj = 0 for all j. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nRemark Let R be a K-algebra with K-basis B. Recall from ([Gr2], Section 2) that an ideal I\nof R is said to be a 2-nomial ideal if I can be generated by elements of the form b1 \u2212 b2 and b,\nwhere b1 , b2 , b \u2208 B. By ([Gr2], Theorem 2.3), if B is a multiplicative K-basis of R (i.e., u, v \u2208 B\nimplies uv = 0 or uv \u2208 B) and I is a 2-nomial ideal of R, then, under the canonical epimorphism\n\u2217\n\u03c0: R \u2192 R/I, the set B = B \u2212 {0} forms a multiplicative K-basis of R/I. Since a multiplicative\nK-basis is trivially a skew multiplicative K-basis and any 2-nomial ideal is trivially a skew\n2-nomial ideal, it is easy to see that in the case that B is a multiplicative K-basis and I is a\n\u2217\n\u2217\n2-nomial ideal we must have B = B \u223cI , where the latter is the set obtained in Theorem 3.4(i)\nabove. That is, actually the preceding Theorem 3.4 generalizes the sufficiency result of ([Gr2],\nTheorem 2.3).\nNext, suppose further that there is a two-sided monomial ordering \u227a on B, that is, (B, \u227a)\nforms an admissible system (B, \u227a) of R and hence R holds a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory\n(note that B is now a skew multiplicative K-basis of R). Moreover, in this case if I is an ideal\nof R, and A = R/I, then it is easily seen that the set of normal monomials in B (modulo I)\nis given by N (I) = B \u2212 LM(I). Since the image N (I) of N (I) under the canonical algebra\n\u2217\nepimorphism \u03c0: R \u2192 A forms a K-basis of A and N (I) \u2286 B , by ([Gr2], Theorem 2.3), we first\nnote the following fact.\n\u2217\n\n3.5. Proposition Let I be a 2-nomial ideal of R in the sense of [Gr2]. Then N (I) = B and\nhence N (I) is a multiplicative K-basis for A = R/I.\n\u0003\nTurning to the case of Theorem 3.4, we shall prove, under the assumption that R has an\nadmissible system, that N (I) forms a skew multiplicative K-basis for A = R/I.\n3.6. Lemma Suppose that R has an admissible system (B, \u227a). Let I be a skew 2-nomial ideal\nof R, A = R/I, and let N (I) be the set of normal monomials in B (modulo I). With notation\nas in Theorem 3.4, the following statements hold.\n\u2217\n\n(i) For each w\u0304 \u2208 N (I), there is a unique \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 and a unique \u016b \u2208 B \u223cI such that w\u0304 = \u03bb\u016b;\nand if w1 , w2 \u2208 N (I) with w1 = \u03bb1 u1 and w2 = \u03bb2 \u03c0(u2 ) respectively, then w1 6= w2 implies\n\n27\n\n\f\u03c0(u1 ) 6= u2 .\n\u2217\n(ii) For each \u016b \u2208 B\u223cI , there is some w\u0304 \u2208 N (I) such that \u016b = \u03bcw\u0304 with \u03bc \u2208 K \u2217 .\n\u2217\n\nProof To prove the assertions mentioned in (i) \u2013 (ii), let us bear in mind that B\u223cI is a K-basis\nof A by Theorem 3.4, and that N (I) is also a K-basis of A by the classical Gr\u00f6bner basis theory.\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(i) Note that N (I) \u2286 B . Let w\u0304 \u2208 N (I). Then it follows from the definition of B\u223cI that w\u0304 = \u03bb\u016b\n\u2217\n\u2217\nfor some \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 and \u016b \u2208 B \u223cI . Since B\u223cI is a K-basis, the obtained expression is unique. If\nw1 , w2 \u2208 N (I) and w1 = \u03bb1 u1 and w2 = \u03bb2 u2 , then u1 = u2 would clearly imply the linear\ndependence of w1 and w2 . Hence the second assertion of (i) follows from the fact that N (I) is\na K-basis.\nP\n\u2217\n(ii) Since N (I) is a K-basis for A, each \u016b \u2208 B \u223cI has a unique linear expression \u016b = m\np=1 \u03bcp wp\nPm\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nwith \u03bcp \u2208 K and wp \u2208 N (I). By (i), \u016b = p=1 \u03bcp \u03bbp up with \u03bbp \u2208 K and up \u2208 B\u223cI , in which\nwp = \u03bbp up and all the up are distinct. If, without loss of generality, \u016b = u1 , then \u016b = \u03bb\u22121\n1 w1 , as\ndesired.\n\u0003\n3.7. Theorem With notation and the assumption as in Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 3.6, N (I) is\na skew multiplicative K-basis for the skew 2-nomial algebra A = R/I.\n\u2217\n\nProof If w1 , w2 \u2208 N (I) and w1 w2 6= 0, then by Lemma 3.6 and the fact that B\u223cI is a skew\n\u2217\nmultiplicative K-basis of A (Theorem 3.4(ii)), there are \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 , \u03bc \u2208 K \u2217 , u1 , u2 \u2208 B \u223cI and\nw3 \u2208 N (I) such that\nw1 * w2 = \u03bb1 u1 \u03bb2 u2\n= \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 u3\n= \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 \u03bcw3 .\nIt follows that the K-basis N (I) of A is a skew multiplicative K-basis.\n\n\u0003\n\nAs we will see below, indeed, a better proof of Theorem 3.7 may be obtained by employing\nthe division by a Gr\u00f6bner basis of I, which involves the following interesting result (a noncommutative analogue of ([ES], Proposition 1.1)).\n3.8. Proposition Suppose that R has an admissible system (B, \u227a), and let I be a skew 2nomial ideal of R. Then I has a Gr\u00f6bner basis G consisting of monomials and skew 2-nomials,\ni.e., elements of the form v \u2212 \u03bbu, s with \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 and v, u, s \u2208 B.\nProof Let G be any Gr\u00f6bner basis of I. Then, since I is generated by skew 2-nomials and\nmonomials, as in the proof of Lemma 3.3, each g \u2208 G has a presentation of the form\ng =\n\nX\n\n\u03bcp (vp \u2212 \u03b3p up ) +\n\np\n\nX\n\n\u03b7q sq\n\nq\n\nwith vp \u2212 \u03b3p up , sq \u2208 I, \u03bcp , \u03b3p , \u03b7q \u2208 K \u2217 ,\nbut vp , up 6\u2208 I for every p.\n\n28\n\n\fP\nLet g = j \u03bbj wj , where \u03bbj \u2208 K \u2217 and wj \u2208 B. If LM(g) 6\u2208 I, then we claim that there is some\nP\nwj appearing in j \u03bbj wj such that wj 6= LM(g), LM(g) \u2212 \u03bcwj \u2208 I, and LM(LM(g) \u2212 \u03bcwj ) =\nLM(g), where \u03bc \u2208 K \u2217 . Otherwise, considering the skew 2-nomial relation \u223cI on B \u222a {0}\ndetermined by I, and letting [LM(g)] be the equivalence class of of \u223cI represented by LM(g),\nby Lemma 3.3 we would have\nX\n\n\u03bbj wj = LC(g)LM(g) =\n\nwj \u2208[LM(g)]\n\nX\n\n\u03bcp (vp \u2212 \u03b3p up ) \u2208 I,\n\nvp ,up \u2208[LM(g)]\n\nand consequently LM(g) \u2208 I, a contradiction. Thus, if we put\n)\n(\nv, u \u2208 B \u2212 I, \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 , v \u2212 \u03bbu \u2208 I, s \u2208 B \u2229 I, such that\n,\nG = v \u2212 \u03bbu, s\nLM(v \u2212 \u03bbu) = LM(gi ), s = LM(gj ) for some gi , gj \u2208 G\nthen LM(G) = LM(G) and hence G is a Gr\u00f6bner basis for I.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor the convenience of statement, we call the Gr\u00f6bner basis G obtained in Lemma 3.8 a skew\n2-nomial Gr\u00f6bner basis of the skew 2-nomial ideal I.\n3.9. Lemma Suppose that R has an admissible system (B, \u227a). Let I be a skew 2-nomial ideal\nof R and G a skew 2-nomial Gr\u00f6bner basis of I. If u \u2208 B satisfying u 6\u2208 I and u 6\u2208 N (I), where\nN (I) is the set of normal monomials in B (modulo I), then u has a presentation\nX\nu =\n\u03bbij wij gj vij + \u03bbu\u2032 with \u03bbij , \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 , wij , vij \u2208 B, gj \u2208 G\ni,j\n\nand u\u2032 \u2208 N (I) satisfying u\u2032 \u227a u.\n\nProof It is simply a consequence of doing division by G. As u 6\u2208 I and u 6\u2208 N (I), there is\nsome gi = ui \u2212 \u03bci si \u2208 G, such that u = \u03bbi wi LM(gi )vi for some \u03bbi \u2208 K \u2217 , wi , vi \u2208 B. Suppose\nLM(gi ) = ui . Then since B is a skew multiplicative K-basis,\nu \u2212 \u03bbi wi gi vi = \u03bbi \u03bci wi si vi = \u03b3i u1 with \u03b3i \u2208 K \u2217\nand u1 \u2208 B satisfying u1 \u227a u.\nNote that u 6\u2208 I implies u1 6\u2208 I. If u1 6\u2208 N (I), then repeat the division procedure for u1 . By the\nwell-ordering property of \u227a, the proof is finished after a finite number of reductions.\n\u0003\nNow, let \u03c0: R \u2192 A = R/I be the canonical epimorphism as before, and suppose that R has\nan admissible system (B, \u227a). If N (I) is the set of normal monomials in B (modulo I) and G is\na skew 2-nomial Gr\u00f6bner basis of I, then, since B is a skew multiplicative K-basis, for any u,\nv \u2208 N (I), it follows from Lemma 3.9 that\neither \u016bv\u0304 = 0,\nor \u016bv\u0304 = uv = \u03bbw\u0304 with \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 , w \u2208 N (I).\n29\n\n\fThis shows that N (I) is a skew multiplicative K-basis for the skew 2-nomial algebra A, that is,\nTheorem 3.7 is recaptured.\nFinally, concerning the existence of a Gr\u00f6bner basis theory for a skew 2-nomial algebra, let\nus mention the following conclusion.\n3.10. Theorem Let R be a K-algebra with the skew multiplicative K-basis B, and let I be a\nskew 2-nomial ideal of R, A = R/I.\n(i) With notation as in Theorem 3.4, if there is a (left, right, or two-sided) monomial ordering \u227a\n\u2217\non B \u223cI , then the skew 2-nomial algebra A has a (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory.\n(ii) With notation and the assumption as in Theorem 3.7, if there is a (left, right, or two-sided)\nmonomial ordering \u227a on N (I), then the skew 2-nomial algebra A has a (left, right, or two-sided)\nGr\u00f6bner basis theory.\n\n4. Almost Skew 2-nomial Algebras\nNaturally, the results of Sections 2 \u2013 3, combined with the working principle of [Li2] (as indicated\nbefore Proposition 2.6), motivate us to introduce the class of algebras with the associated graded\nalgebra which is a skew 2-nomial algebra (such as the algebras given in Example (8) of Section\n2), namely the almost skew 2-nomial algebras defined below. As in previous sections, a one-sided\nor two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory means the one in the sense of Definition 1.4 or it is the one\nindicated before Theorem 2.10, depending on whether a skew multiplicative K-basis is used or\nnot. All notations used before are maintained.\nLet R = \u2295\u03b3\u2208\u0393 R\u03b3 be a \u0393-graded K-algebra, where \u0393 is an ordered semigroup by a total ordering <, and we assume that R has an admissible system (B, \u227a), where B is a skew multiplicative\nK-basis of R consisting of \u0393-homogeneous elements, and \u227a is a two-sided monomial ordering on\nB. Hence R has a two-sided Gr\u00f6bner basis theory with respect to (B, \u227a).\nLet I be an ideal of R, A = R/I, and A\u0393LH = R/hLH(I)i the \u0393-leading homogeneous algebra\nof A as defined in Section 2, where LH(I) is the set of \u0393-leading homogeneous elements of I.\n4.1. Definition With notation as above, if hLH(I)i is a skew 2-nomial ideal, or equivalently,\nif A\u0393LH = R/hLH(I)i is a skew 2-nomial algebra, then we call the quotient algbera A = R/I an\nalmost skew 2-nomial algebra.\nBefore mentioning the main result of this section, let us demonstrate, by referring to Examples (5) \u2013 (7) of Section 2, how to obtain an almost skew 2-nomial algebra in terms of Gr\u00f6bner\nbases in R. We begin by recording a property concerning the homogeneous generators of the\n\u0393-graded ideal hLH(I)i, which is the same as the property concerning the monomial generators\nof the monomial ideal hLM(I)i if LH( ) once is replaced by LM( ).\n30\n\n\f4.2. Lemma With notation as above, let h be a nonzero \u0393-homogeneous element of R. Then\nh \u2208 hLH(I)i if and only if h \u2208 LH(I).\nProof Since h is a homogeneous element, if h \u2208 hLH(I)i, then\nh=\n\nX\n\nHij LH(fi )Tij , where Hij , Tij are homogeneous elements and fi \u2208 I.\n\ni,j\n\nIf we put fi = LH(fi ) + fi\u2032 , where deg(fi\u2032 ) < deg(fi ), then f =\nf=\n\nX\n\nHij LH(fi )Tij +\n\nij\n\nX\n\nHij fi\u2032 Tij = h +\n\ni,j\n\nP\n\ni,j\n\nX\n\nHij fi Tij \u2208 I and\n\nHij fi\u2032 Tij .\n\ni,j\n\nHence it is clear that h = LH(f ) \u2208 LH(I). The converse is trivial.\n\n\u0003\n\n4.3. Proposition Let J be a \u0393-graded ideal of R. If J is a skew 2-nomial ideal, then J has a\nskew 2-nomial Gr\u00f6bner basis G (as obtained in Proposition 3.8) but consisting of \u0393-homogeneous\nelements.\nProof\nthat J\nfor all\nobtain\n\nTo be convenient, let H\u0393 (J) denote the set of \u0393-homogeneous elements of J. Noticing\nP\nis a \u0393-graded ideal, if f = j r\u03b3j \u2208 R with r\u03b3j \u2208 R\u03b3j , then f \u2208 J if and only if r\u03b3j \u2208 J\nj. Thus, since B is a skew multiplicative K-basis, exactly as in Proposition 1.3(i) we\na homogeneous Gr\u00f6bner basis for J as follows\n\b\nG = h \u2208 H\u0393 (J)\n\nif h\u2032 \u2208 H\u0393 (J) and h\u2032 6= h, then LM(h\u2032 ) 6 | LM(h) .\n\nFurthermore, noticing that J is also a skew 2-nomial ideal, actually as in the proof of Proposition\n3.8, subject to G above we obtain a Gr\u00f6bner basis of J in the desired form\n)\n(\nv, u \u2208 B \u2212 J, \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 , v \u2212 \u03bbu \u2208 H\u0393 (J), s \u2208 B \u2229 J, such that\n.\nG = v \u2212 \u03bbu, s\nLM(v \u2212 \u03bbu) = LM(hi ), s = LM(hj ) for some hi , hj \u2208 G\n\u0003\n4.4. Corollary Suppose that R has a two-sided admissible system (B, \u227agr ) in which \u227agr is\na \u0393-graded two-sided monomial ordering on B, and let A = R/I be an almost skew 2-nomial\nalgebra in the sense of Definition 4.1. Then I has a Gr\u00f6bner basis G such that LH(G ) is a\nhomogeneous skew 2-nomial Gr\u00f6bner basis for the ideal hLH(I)i with respect to (B, \u227agr ).\nProof Writing J = hLH(I)i, it follows from Proposition 4.3 and Lemma 4.2 that J has a\nskew 2-nomial Gr\u00f6bner basis G \u2282 LH(I). Since \u227agr is a \u0393-graded monomial ordering on B, by\nProposition 2.4(ii), the desired Gr\u00f6bner basis G for I is given by\nG = {f \u2208 I | LH(f ) = g, g \u2208 G}.\n\u0003\n31\n\n\fIt follows from Corollary 4.4, Theorem 2.10, Theorem 3.7, and Theorem 3.10 that we can\nnow write down the main result of this section.\n4.5. Theorem Suppose that R has a two-sided admissible system (B, \u227agr ) in which \u227agr is a\n\u0393-graded two-sided monomial ordering on B. Let I be an ideal of R, A = R/I. If I = hG i is\ngenerated by a Gr\u00f6bner basis G such that LH(G ) consists of monomials and \u0393-homogeneous\nskew 2-nomials, then the following statements hold.\n(i) hLH(I)i = hLH(G )i is a \u0393-graded skew 2-nomial ideal, the \u0393-leading homogeneous algebra\nA\u0393LH = R/hLH(I)i of A is a skew 2-nomial algebra, and hence A is an almost skew 2-nomial\nalgebra.\n(ii) Let N (I) be the set of normal monomials in B (modulo I), and write\n[\nN\n(I) = {\u00fb = u + hLH(I)i | u \u2208 N (I)}\n[\nfor the K-basis of A\u0393LH (as in Section 2).

Some Open Problems\nAs one may see from previous sections, the (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner basis theory\nintroduced for algebras with a skew multiplicative K-basis not only is in principle consistent\nwith the well-known existed Gr\u00f6bner basis theory, but also covers certain new classes of algebras\n(such as two subclasses of quantum binomial algebras, down-up algebras, and algebras with the\nassociated graded algebra of such types) which are beyond the scope of algebras treated by\nthe well-known existed Gr\u00f6bner basis theory. However, the already obtained results concerning\n(almost) skew 2-nomial algebras are obviously far from being complete, for instance, even if for\nan algebra of the type as described in Examples (1), respectively Example (2) of Section 2 (\nwhich is a Noetherian quantum binomial algebra whenever \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03b3 \u2208 K \u2217 and \u03b3 2 = 1, respectively\n\u03bb2 = 1), we do not know if there is an implementable analogue of Buchberger Algorithm for\nproducing a finite (left or right) Gr\u00f6bner basis; and moreover, proper subclasses of practical\n(almost) skew 2-nomial algebras, that are not the types we have considered in Section 2 but\n32\n\n\fhave a (left, right, or two-sided) monomial ordering, need to be dug further. Therefore, we finish\nthis paper by summarizing several open problems related to preceding sections:\n1. Under the Noetherian assumption, is there an analogue of Buchberger Algorithm for the\nalgebras described in Corollary 2.5(i) \u2013 (iii) respectively?\n2. For the algebras described in Corollary 2.5(i) \u2013 (iii), especially for those described in (i)\n\u2013 (ii) (including many quantum binomial algebras), is there a computational module theory\n(representation theory) in terms of (left, right, or two-sided) Gr\u00f6bner bases as that developed\nin [Gr1] and [Gr2]?\n3. Find more subclasses of skew 2-nomial algebras, in which each algebra is not the type as\ndescribed in Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 respectively, but has a (left, right, or two-sided)\nmonomial ordering.\n4. Find more subclasses of almost skew 2-nomial algebras, in which the \u0393-leading homogeneous\nalgebra A\u0393LH of each algebra A is not the type as described in Theorem 2.7 and Theorem 2.8\nrespectively, but satisfies the conditions of Theorem 2.10.\n5. For algebras as described in Example (8) of Section 2, if the Gr\u00f6bner basis theory of AN\nLH\nis algorithmically realizable, is it possible to realize the lifted Gr\u00f6bner basis theory of A in an\nalgorithmic way?\n6. In view of Remark (2) given before Theorem 2.10, is there an algorithmically realizable\nGr\u00f6bner basis theory for the down-up algebras of the type A(\u03b1, 0, \u03b3)?\n7. Let G be a Gr\u00f6bner basis of the ideal I = hGi in the free K-algebra KhXi = KhX1 , ..., Xn i\nwith respect to some N-graded monomial ordering, such that LH(G) is of the type as described\nin Corollary 2.5(i) or Corollary 2.5(ii), but with \u03a9 = \u2205 and all the \u03bbji 6= 0, and such that the\nN-leading homogeneous algebra AN\nLH = KhXi/hLH(G)i of A = KhXi/I is a quantum binomial\nalgebra in the sense of [Laf] and [G-I2]. By referring to [Laf], [G-I2] and [Li2], explore the\nstructural properties of A via AN\nLH in a computational way.\n\n[AL]\n[Ap]\n[Ben]\n[Bu]\n[BGV]\n\n[CM]\n\nReferences\nJ. Apel and W.
