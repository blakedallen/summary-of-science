The dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is due to a non-vanishing\nquark anti-quark condensate, hq\u0304qi \u2243 (250MeV)3 in the\nvacuum, which induces the presence of the light NambuGoldstone particles, the pions and kaons in the hadron\nspectrum. The confinement represents that only colorless\nstates are observed in the spectrum, which is commonly\ndescribed by the linearly rising potential between two\nheavy quarks at large distances, VQ\u0304Q (R) = \u03c3s R, where\n\u03c3s \u2243 (425MeV)2 is the string tension.\nIt is expected that chiral symmetry can be restored\nand color degrees of freedom can be freed at high temperature and/or density. The interplay between chiral\nand deconfinement phase transitions at finite temperature and density are of continuous interests for studying\nthe QCD phase diagram [1\u20139]. The chiral restoration\nis characterized by the restoration of chiral symmetry\nand the deconfinement phase transition is characterized\nby the breaking of center symmetry, which are only well\ndefined in two extreme quark mass limits, respectively.\nIn the chiral limit when the current quark mass is zero\nm = 0, the chiral condensate hq\u0304qi is the order parameter\nfor the chiral phase transition. When the current quark\nmass goes to infinity m \u2192 \u221e, QCD becomes pure gauge\nSU (3) theory, which is center symmetric in the vacuum,\nand the usually used order parameter is the Polyakov\nloop expectation value hP i [1], which is related to the\nheavy quark free energy. At zero density and chiral limit,\nlattice QCD results show that the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions occur at the same critical tem-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nxufukun@mail.ihep.ac.cn\nhznu.mao@gmail.com\nmukherjee@mail.ihep.ac.cn\nhuangm@mail.ihep.ac.cn\n\nperature, e.g, see Ref. [15\u201319], and also review papers\n[20, 21]. This result is highly nontrivial because these two\ndistinct phase transitions involve different mechanisms at\ndifferent energy scales. It has been largely believed for a\nlong time that chiral symmetry restoration always coincides with deconfinement phase transition in the whole\n(T, \u03bc) plane.\nHowever, for the case of finite physical quark mass,\nneither the chiral condensate nor the Polyakov loop is\na good order parameter. For heavy quark, there is no\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking (e.g, see [12]) thus\nno chiral restoration. On the other hand, the linear potential description for confinement property is not suitable for light quark system. In recent years, several lattice groups have made much effort on investigating the\nchiral and deconfinement phase transition temperatures\nwith almost physical quark masses, e.g, RBC-Bielefeld\ngroup [23], which later merged with part of the MILC\ngroup [22] and formed the hotQCD group [25, 26], and\nWuppertal-Budapest group [29\u201333]. The result from the\nRBC-Bielefeld group in 2006 [23] found that the two\npseudo-critical temperatures for Nf = 2 + 1 coincide\nat Tc = 192(7)(4)MeV. The Wuppetal-Budapest group\nfound that for the case of Nf = 2+1, there are three pseudocritical temperatures, the transition temperature for\n\u03c7(ud)\n= 151(3)(3) MeV,\nchiral restoration of u, d quarks Tc\nthe transition temperature for s quark number susceptibility Tcs = 175(2)(4)MeV and the deconfinement transition temperature Tcd = 176(3)(4)MeV from the Polyakov\nloop. Recently, it is shown in [27, 28], by using an improved HISQ action, hotQCD collaboration results are\nclose to the Wuppetal-Budapest collaboration results.\nThe relation between the chiral and deconfinement\nphase transitions has also attracted more interest recently in studying the phase diagram at high baryon density region [10]. It is conjectured in Ref. [11] that in large\nNc limit, a confined but chiral symmetric phase, which is\ncalled quarkyonic phase can exist in the high baryon density region. The quarkyonic phase or chiral density wave\nstate is due to the quark-hole pairing near the Fermi sur-\n\n\f2\nface. Nevertheless, it attracts a lot of interests to study\nwhether such a chiral symmetric but confined phase can\nsurvive in real QCD phase diagram, and how it competes\nwith nuclear matter and the color superconducting phase\n[13].\nIn the framework of QCD effective models, there is still\nno dynamical model which can describe the chiral symmetry breaking and confinement simultaneously. The\nmain difficulty of effective QCD model to include confinement mechanism lies in that it is difficult to calculate the Polyakov loop analytically. Currently, the popular models used to investigate the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions are the Polyakov Nambu-JonaLasinio model (PNJL) [34\u201341] and Polyakov linear sigma\nmodel (PLSM) [42, 43]. However, the shortcoming of\nthese models is that the temperature dependence of the\nPolyakov-loop potential is put in by hand from lattice\nresult, which cannot be self-consistently extended to finite baryon density. Recently, efforts have been made\nin Ref.[44, 45] to derive a low-energy effective theory for\nconfinement-deconfinement and chiral-symmetry breaking/restoration.\nRecent investigation revealed that quark propagator,\nheat kernels can also act as an order parameter as they\ntransform non trivially under the center transformation\nrelated to deconfinement transition [46\u201348]. The exciting result is the behavior of spectral sum of the Dirac\noperator under center transformation [47, 49\u201351]. A new\norder parameter, called dressed Polyakov loop has been\ndefined which can be represented as a spectral sum of\nthe Dirac operator [51]. It has been found the infrared\npart of the spectrum particularly plays a leading role\nin confinement [47]. This result is encouraging since it\ngives a hope to relate the chiral phase transition with the\nconfinement-deconfinement phase transition. The order\nparameter for chiral phase transition is related to the\nspectral density of the Dirac operator through BanksCasher relation [4]. Therefore, both the dressed Polyakov\nloop and the chiral condensate are related to the spectral sum of the Dirac operator. Behavior of the dressed\nPolyakov loop is mainly studied in the framework of Lattice gauge theory [52\u201354]. Apart from that, studies based\non Dyson-Schwinger equations [55\u201357] and PNJL model\n[58, 59] have been carried out. In those studies the role of\ndressed Polyakov loop as an order parameter is discussed\nat zero chemical potential. The dressed Polyakov loop\nat finite temperature and density has been investigated\nin the two-flavor NJL model in Ref.[60]. In this paper,\nwe show the phase diagram in the framework of threeflavor NJL model by using the dressed Polyakov loop as\nan equivalent order parameter.\nThis paper is organized as follows: We introduce the\ndressed Polyakov loop as an equivalent order parameter\nof confinement deconfinement phase transition and the\nNJL model in Sec. II. Then in Sec.III, we show the results of three-flavor QCD phase diagram in T \u2212 \u03bc plane\nin the chiral limit and in the case of explicit chiral symmetry breaking, respectively. At the end, we give the\n\nconclusion and discussion.\nII.\n\nDRESSED POLYAKOV LOOP AND THE\nTHREE-FLAVOR NJL MODEL\n\nWe firstly introduce the dressed Polyakov loop. To do\nthis we have to consider a U (1) valued boundary condition for the fermionic fields in the temporal direction\ninstead of the canonical choice of anti-periodic boundary\ncondition,\n\u03c8(x, \u03b2) = e\u2212i\u03c6 \u03c8(x, 0),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 is the phase angle and \u03b2 is the inverse\ntemperature.\nDual quark condensate \u03a3n is then defined by the\nFourier transform (w.r.t the phase \u03c6) of the general\nboundary condition dependent quark condensate [51\u201353],\nZ 2\u03c0\nd\u03c6 \u2212in\u03c6\n\u03a3n = \u2212\ne\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i\u03c6 ,\n(2)\n2\u03c0\n0\nwhere n is the winding number.\nParticular case of n = 1 is called the dressed Polyakov\nloop which transforms in the same way as the conventional thin Polyakov loop under the center symmetry and\nhence is an order parameter for the deconfinement transition [51\u201353]. It reduces to the thin Polyakov loop and\nto the dual of the conventional chiral condensate in infinite and zero quark mass limits respectively, i.e., in the\nchiral limit m \u2192 0 we get the dual of the conventional\nchiral condensate and in the m \u2192 \u221e limit we have thin\nPolyakov loop [51\u201353].\nThe Lagrangian of three-flavor NJL model [61] is given\nas\no\nXn\n(\u03c8\u0304\u03c4a \u03c8)2 + (\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4a \u03c8)2\nL = \u03c8\u0304(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 m)\u03c8 + Gs\na\n\nn\no\n\u2212 K Detf [\u03c8\u0304(1 + \u03b35 )\u03c8] + Detf [\u03c8\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\u03c8] .\n\n(3)\n\nWhere \u03c8 = (u, d, s)T denotes the transpose of the quark\nfield, and m = Diag(mu , md , ms ) is the corresponding\nmass matrix in the flavor space. \u03c4a with a = 1, * * * , Nf2 \u22121\nare the eight Gell-Mann matrices, and Detf means determinant in flavor space. The last term is the standard\nform of the 't Hooft interaction, which is invariant under\nSU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R \u00d7 U (1)B symmetry, but breaks down\nthe UA (1) symmetry.\nThe \u03c6 dependent thermodynamic potential in the\nmean field level is given as following:\nX\nX\n\u03a9\u03c6 =\n\u03a9\u03c6,Mf + 2Gs\nh\u03c3i2\u03c6,f\nf\n\nf\n\n\u2212 4Kh\u03c3i\u03c6,u h\u03c3i\u03c6,d h\u03c3i\u03c6,s ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith\n\u2212\nd3 p h\n1\nEp,f + ln(1 + e\u2212\u03b2Ep,f )\n3\n\u03b2\n\u039b (2\u03c0)\ni\n+\n1\n+ ln(1 + e\u2212\u03b2Ep,f ) .\n(5)\n\u03b2\n\n\u03a9\u03c6,Mf = \u22122Nc\n\nZ\n\n\f3\nWhere the sum is in the flavor space, Ep,f =\n\nq\n2\np2 + M\u03c6,f\n\n\u00b1\nand Ep,f\n= Ep,f \u00b1 [\u03bc + i(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0)T ], with the constituent\nquark mass\n\nM\u03c6,i = mi \u2212 4Gs h\u03c3i\u03c6,i + 2Kh\u03c3i\u03c6,j h\u03c3i\u03c6,k ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere (i, j, k) is the quark flavor indices (u, d, s), and\nh\u03c3i\u03c6,f = h\u03c8\u0304f \u03c8f i\u03c6 . We will only consider isospin symmetric quark matter and define a uniform chemical potential\n\u03bc for u, d and s.\nIt is known that the NJL model lacks of confinement\nand the gluon dynamics is encoded in a static coupling\nconstant for four point contact interaction. However, assuming that we can read the information of confinement\nfrom the dual chiral condensate, it would be interesting\nto see the behavior of the dressed Polyakov loop in a scenario without any explicit mechanism for confinement.\nThe thermodynamic potential contains imaginary\npart. We take only the real part of the potential and\nthe imaginary phase factor is not considered in this work.\nThe mean field h\u03c3i\u03c6 is obtained by minimizing the potential for each value of \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) for fixed T and \u03bc.\nThe conventional chiral condensate is h\u03c3i\u03c0 = h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i\u03c0 .

The almost zero\nvalue of \u03a31 for small temperatures is due to the fact that\nthe U (1) boundary condition dependent general quark\ncondensate nearly does not vary with the angle \u03c6 for\nsmall temperatures (see Eq. 2).\n\n\f4\nIt is seen that the phase transitions for chiral restoration and dressed Polyakov loop are of 1st order in the\nwhole T \u2212 \u03bc plane.

For \u2212h\u03c3i, at smaller\ntemperatures it remains constant at a value corresponding to the value of the conventional chiral condensate in\nthe vacuum, then it rapidly decreases in a small window of temperature and eventually almost saturates to\na lower value.

It remains almost zero for small\ntemperatures and then rises rapidly, finally saturates to\na high value which varies very slowly with temperatures.\nThe almost zero value of \u03a31 for small temperatures is due\nto the fact that the U (1) boundary condition dependent\ngeneral quark condensate nearly does not vary with the\nangle \u03c6 for small temperatures (see Eq. 2).\nThe critical temperature for a real phase transition\nor the pseudo-critical temperature for a crossover is extracted from the susceptibility of the order parameter or\nthe temperature derivative of the order parameter. For\nexample, for chiral phase transition of strange quark, the\n(pseudo)critical temperature is extracted from the temperature derivative \u2202(\u2212 < \u03c3s >)/(\u2202T ). This quantity\ndescribes how fast the order parameter changes with temperature. Normally the critical temperature corresponds\nto the fastest change of the order parameter, and the temperature derivative of the order parameter shows a peak\nat the critical point. However, there are some subtleties\nto determine the pseudo-critical temperature for the chiral restoration of the strange quark. We show how we determine the pseudo-critical temperature of the crossover\nby using Fig.5, which is the temperature derivative of the\nchiral condensate of the strange quark corresponding to\nFig.4.\nFor \u03bc = 0, from Fig.5 one can observe that the temperature derivative of the strange quark condensate shows a\npeak at T = 196MeV, correspondingly, from Fig.4, one\ncan see that the strange quark condensate changes fast\nat T = 196MeV, which is the critical temperature for\nchiral phase transition of the u, d quarks at zero chemical potential. However, the value of the strange quark\nu,d\ncondensate at Tc,\u03c7\n= 196MeV is still around its vacuum value, one cannot locate the pseudo-critical temu,d\nperature of the strange quark at Tc,\u03c7\n= 196MeV even\n\n\f5\n\n0.00016\n\n0\n\nMeV\n\n200MeV\n320MeV\n460MeV\n\n0.00012\n\n490MeV\n\n0.00008\n\n0.00004\n\n0.00000\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nT[MeV]\n\nFIG. 5:\nThe derivative of strange chiral condensate\n\u2202(\u2212h\u03c3is )/\u2202T as functions of T for different values of \u03bc.\n\nThe temperature derivative of the strange quark condensate at \u03bc = 200MeV is similar to the case at \u03bc = 0.\nThe only difference is that the peak moves to a lower\ntemperature. The small jump at the large strange chiral condensate region is induced by the u, d quark chiral\nphase transition. It cannot be regarded as the phase transition for strange quark even though it corresponds to a\npeak of the strange chiral susceptibility, because the order parameter does not change so much comparing with\nits vacuum value. It should still be regarded as in the chiral symmetry breaking phase. At \u03bc = 320MeV, it is seen\nfrom Fig.5 that the left peak develops to a sharp peak at\nu,d\nTc,\u03c7\n, and an obvious peak shows up in the right bump\nregion. Therefore, one can extract the pseudo-critical\ntemperature for the chiral phase transition of the strange\nquark. For higher chemical potential, e.g, \u03bc = 460MeV\nor \u03bc = 490MeV, because u, d quarks are already in chiral symmetric phase, there is only one peak shows up for\nthe temperature derivative of the strange quark condensate in Fig. 5, and the location of the peak gives the\npseudo-critical temperature of the phase transition.\nAs we have discussed in detail above, one has to combine the information from the order parameter itself as\nwell as the temperature derivative of the order parameter\n\nin order to determine the pseudo-critical temperature of\nthe crossover. This method is also used to determine the\ndressed Polyakov loop of the strange quark. The critical\nand pseudo-critical temperatures extracted from the temperature derivative of the order parameters are shown in\nFig. 6. It is found that the the chiral and deconfinement\nphase transitions are flavor dependent.\nAt low baryon chemical potential region when \u03bc <\n270MeV, for light flavors, i.e. for u, d quarks, we observe from Fig. 3 that the conventional chiral condensate\nand the dressed Polyakov loop change rapidly with the\nincrease of temperature. From the temperature derivative of the order parameters of the chiral condensate\nand dressed Polyakov loop, we can obtain two separate\npseudo-critical temperatures Tc\u03c7 and TcD for fixed \u03bc, and\nwe find Tc\u03c7 is always smaller than TcD .\nHowever, in the chemical potential region when \u03bc <\n270MeV, for s quark, from Fig. 4 we can see that the\nconventional chiral condensate and dressed Polyakov loop\nchange smoothly with the increase of temperature. From\nthe temperature derivative of the order parameters, one\ncannot extract the values of the pseudo-critical temperatures as already discussed. Therefore, in Fig. 6 of the\nthree-flavor phase diagram, we can read that in the region around 0 < \u03bc < 270MeV, the phase transitions for\nu, d are crossover, and different order parameters have\ndifferent pseudo-critical temperatures. The s flavor experiences a rapid crossover, and no pseudo-critical temperatures can be extracted from the order parameters. From\nthe lattice results in Ref.[31] at zero chemical potential,\nthere is also no pseudo-critical temperature for the order\nparameter of strange quark's chiral condensate.\n\n-< >(black)\n\n200\n\n(Blue)\n\n175\n\nu,d-quark\n\n150\nT [MeV]\n\nthough there is a peak for the temperature derivative of\nthe strange quark condensate. The reasonable explanation of the fast change of the strange quark condensate\nu,d\nat Tc,\u03c7\n= 196MeV is that the strange quark feels the\nchiral phase transition of u, d quarks due to the flavor\nmixing effect. For \u03bc = 0, from Fig.5 one can also observe a bump region of the temperature derivative of the\nstrange quark condensate around T = 250MeV, however,\nthere is no obvious peak shown up. Therefore, we cannot\nextract an explicit pseudo-critical temperature from the\nchiral phase transition of the strange quark. Correspondingly, we find that the strange quark condensate at \u03bc = 0\nchanges smoothly with temperature.\n\ns-quark\n\n125\n100\nCEP\n\n75\n=317.8,T=68.4\n\n50\n25\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n[MeV]\n\nFIG. 6: Three-flavor phase diagram in the T \u2212 \u03bc plane for the\ncase of mu = md = 5MeV and ms = 140.7MeV.

The difference comes from: 1) different model\nparameters have been used, 2) the coupling of s quark\nto u, d quark contributes one extra term in the thermodynamical potential comparing with the pure two-flavor\ncase. The location of CEP in this work is in good agreement with that in Ref. [66].\nIn Fig.7 and Fig.8, we show the details of locating\nthe CEP. In the first order phase region, there are two\nbranches of number densities, i.e, for fixed chemical potential, the number density nq = \u2212 \u2202\u03a9\n\u2202\u03bc has a jump at\nthe transition temperature. The two branches of number densities merge at the CEP. This feature is shown in\nFig.7. At the CEP, the phase transition is of second order and this is indicated by the divergent behavior of the\nnumber susceptibility. We show the number susceptibil2\nity \u03c7q = \u2212 \u2202\u2202\u03bc\u03a92 as functions of the temperature in Fig.8.\nIt is clearly seen that \u03c7q develops a sharp peak at CEP.\n\n0.75\n\n0.00\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\nT[MeV]\n\nFIG. 8: The number susceptibility \u03c7q /T 2 as functions of the\ntemperature for different chemical potentials.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\n0.012\n280\n\nMeV\n\n300\n\nMeV\n\n310\n\nMeV\n\n317.8MeV\n\n0.009\n\n324\n\nMeV\n\n340\n\nMeV\n\nFIG. 9: Conjectured 3D QCD phase diagram at finite temperature T , quark chemical potential \u03bcq and isospin chemical\npotential \u03bcI .\n\nn\n\nq\n\n0.006\n\n0.003\n\n0.000\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nT[MeV]\n\nFIG. 7: The quark number density nq as functions of the\ntemperature for different chemical potentials, and nq is in\nunit of [GeV3 ].\n\nWe investigate the chiral condensate and the dressed\nPolyakov loop or dual chiral condensate at finite temperature and density in the three-flavor Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio\nmodel. It is found that in the chiral limit, the phase transitions are of 1st order and the critical temperature for\nchiral phase transition coincides with that of the dressed\nPolyakov loop. In the case of explicit chiral symmetry\nbreaking, it is found that the phase transitions are flavor dependent, and there is a phase transition range for\neach flavor. The transition range of s quark is located at\nhigher temperature and higher baryon density than that\nof u, d quarks. At low baryon density region, it is found\nthat the transition range of u, d quarks are not separated\n\n\f7\ntoo much from that of the s quark, however, the separation of the transition ranges for u, d quarks and s quark\nbecome wider and wider with the increase of the chemical\npotential.\nFor light u, d quarks, the pseudo-critical temperature\nfor chiral transition Tc\u03c7 is smaller than that of the dressed\nPolyakov loop TcD in the low baryon density region where\nthe transition is a crossover, and these two phase transitions coincide in the 1st order phase transition region\nat high baryon density. For s quark, both transitions are\nof smooth crossover at low baryon density, and becomes\nrapid crossover at moderate baryon density region where\nthe pseudo-critical temperatures for the chiral condensate and the dressed Polyakov loop are separated, then\nat enough high baryon density, these two transitions coincide with each other.\nOur results are based on the NJL model, where the\ngluon dynamics is encoded in a static coupling constant\nfor four point contact interaction, a quantitative comparison will not match with lattice results. However, we\nbelieve the scenario of the sequential phase transitions is\nphysically correct.\nTill now, there are six quark flavors observed in experiment. These six flavors cover a very wide energy scale,\nfrom several MeV to several hundred GeV. Only light\nquarks experience dynamically chiral symmetry breaking\nin the vacuum, and chiral phase transition in high temperature and density. However, there is no good order\nparameters to describe the deconfinement phase transition of light quarks. The conventional Polyakov loop is\na good order parameter for confinement deconfinement\nphase transition in the limit of infinity heavy quark mass,\nand has the interpretation of the free energy of an infinity heavy quark. In analogy to that we can regard the\ndressed Polyakov loop as an order parameter for confinement deconfinement phase transition for a quark with\nmass m, and interpret the dressed Polyakov loop as the\nfree energy of a quark with any mass m [54]. Therefore, in principle, each flavor can have different critical\ntemperatures for deconfinement phase transition. Lattice\nresults already reflect such properties at zero chemical\npotential, e.g. the pseudo-critical temperatures for order\nparameters of u, d quarks, s quark and the Polyakov loop\nare different, and the the pseudo-critical temperature is\nhigher for heavier quark mass.\nIt is natural to understand that the separation of\nthe phase transition range for different flavors becomes\nwider and wider with the increase of the chemical potential. Lattice result at zero chemical potential gives\nthat the pseudo-critical temperature for u, d quarks is\naround 155MeV, and for s quark is around 175MeV.\nThe difference is around 20MeV. However, at zero temperature, the u, d quarks restores chiral symmetry at\nthe chemical potential around their vacuum constituent\nmasses, i.e. \u03bcu,d\n\u223c Mu,d \u223c 330MeV, and the s quark rec\nstores chiral symmetry at the chemical potential around\n\u03bcsc \u223c Ms \u223c 550MeV. The difference is around 200MeV.\n\nBased on above analysis, in Fig. 9, we show our conjectured 3 dimension (3D) QCD phase diagram for finite\ntemperature T , quark chemical potential \u03bcq and isospin\nchemical potential \u03bcI .\nIn the plane of (\u03bc, T ), each flavor has its own transition\nrange. The transition range is wider in the low baryon\ndensity, and becomes narrower and narrower with the increase of the chemical potential, and eventually merge at\nhigher chemical potential. By using the lattice results\nat zero density, we identify the phase transition range\naround 155MeV for u, d quark, 175MeV for s quark, and\n190MeV for heavy flavor. The upper solid line is for the\nPolyakov loop, which does not change so much with the\nincrease of baryon density. This result agrees with that in\nany Polyakov loop NJL model and Polyakov loop linear\nsigma model. Due to the flavor dependent phase transitions, we naturally expect the color superconducting\nphase for two-flavor quark system and three-flavor quark\nsystem in different baryon density regions [13]. Due to\nthe finite mass of strange quark, the three-flavor color\nsuperconducting phase can be in the color flavor locking (CFL) phase[67], CFL-kaon condensate phase (CFLK)[68], or uSC/dSC phase [69].\nWhen isospin asymmetry is considered, the phase diagram becomes much more complicated. At low baryon\ndensity region, there will be pion superfluidity and kaon\nsuperfluidity phases [70]. In the color superconducting\nphase, because isospin asymmetry induces mismatch between the pairing quarks, there will appear unstable gapless excitations [71, 72] when charge neutrality condition\nis considered. It has been vastly discussed in many literatures about the true ground state of the charge neutral\ntwo-flavor and three-flavor cold quark matter, e.g, the\nLarkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) sate or other\ncrystalline structure [73], the gluon condensate state [74],\nthe current generation state [75], and so on. The detailed analysis given in Ref. [76] show that in the gapless\ncolor superconducting phase, both the phase part and\nmagnitude part of the order parameter will develop instabilities. The phase part develops into the chromomagnetic instability, which induces the plane-wave state; The\nmagnitude part develops the Sarma instability and Higgs\ninstability, the Sarma instability can be competed with\ncharge neutrality condition. If the Higgs instability cannot be cured by the electric or color Coulomb interaction,\nit will induce the inhomogeneous state.\n\nAcknowledgments: The work of M.H. is supported\nby CAS program \"Outstanding young scientists abroad\nbrought-in\", and NSFC under the number of 10735040\nand 10875134, and K.C.Wong Education Foundation,\nHong Kong.
