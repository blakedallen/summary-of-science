It emerged in trying to respond to the question:\n\"What is the necessary and sufficient conditions for the reality of the spectrum of a linear\noperator?,\" and indeed turned out to achieve its basic goal of understanding the mathematical\nstructure of the P T -symmetric quantum mechanics [6]. It also found remarkable applications\nin other areas of theoretical physics [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\nSince the initial announcement of the results of [1] in July 2001, there have appeared dozens\nof publications exploring various aspects of the pseudo-Hermitian operators. Among these are\n\u2217\n\nE-mail address: amostafazadeh@ku.edu.tr\n\n1\n\n\fa number of articles [12, 11] reflecting the view that the notion of a pseudo-Hermitian operator\nhas indeed been known since as early as the 1940's through the works of Dirac, Pauli, Gupta,\nBleuler, Sudarshan, Lee and Wick [13] and other authors who developed quantum theories\nbased on a vector space with an indefinite-metric [14]. This view seems to support the claim\nthat pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics can be reduced to the well-known indefinite-metric\nquantum theories. The main purpose of the present article is to show that this is actually\nnot true. It will be shown that there is a subtle difference between the notion of a Hermitian\noperator in an indefinite-metric vector space (that is admittedly a 'pseudo-Hermitian operator')\nand the notion of a pseudo-Hermitian operator as defined in [1]. This difference which has also\nbeen overlooked in a number of recent publications [12] has important conceptual and technical\nramifications. These will also be alluded to here.\n\n2\n\nPseudo-, \u03b7-pseudo-, and quasi-Hermitian operators\n\nWe begin our discussion by recalling some basic definitions.\nDef. 1: Let H be a separable Hilbert space. Then a linear operator H : H \u2192 H is\nsaid to be pseudo-Hermitian [1] if there exists an invertible, self-adjoint, linear operator\n\u03b7 : H \u2192 H satisfying H \u2020 = \u03b7 H\u03b7 \u22121 , where \u2020 denotes the adjoint of the corresponding\noperator.\nAccording to Def. 1, the pseudo-Hermiticity of an operator is not sensitive to the particular form\nof the operators \u03b7 satisfying H \u2020 = \u03b7 H\u03b7 \u22121 but to the existence of such operators. In fact, it is\nnot difficult to see that either such an operator \u03b7 does not exist and H is not pseudo-Hermitian\nor there are infinitely many \u03b7's fulfilling H \u2020 = \u03b7 H\u03b7 \u22121 and subsequently H is pseudo-Hermitian.\nIn the latter case, we shall denote the set of all such \u03b7's by E(H). For a given diagonalizable\npseudo-Hermitian operator with a discrete spectrum, the problem of the construction of the\nmost general \u03b7 \u2208 E(H) is addressed in [3].\nDef. 2: Let H be a separable Hilbert space and \u03b7 : H \u2192 H be a given invertible, selfadjoint, linear operator. Then a linear operator H : H \u2192 H satisfying H \u2020 = \u03b7 H\u03b7 \u22121 is\ncalled \u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian [1].\nIt is essential to observe that, unlike Def. 1, Def. 2 involves a fixed operator \u03b7. Clearly, \u03b7pseudo-Hermitian operators are pseudo-Hermitian, but not every pseudo-Hermitian operator is\n\u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian. This is simply because \u03b7 may happen not to belong to E(H). In summary,\n\n2\n\n\fthe set of \u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian operators is just a proper subset of the set of pseudo-Hermitian\noperators [15].\nDef. 3: Let H be a separable Hilbert space. Then a pseudo-Hermitian operator H : H \u2192\nH is said to be quasi-Hermitian if E(H) includes a positive operator \u03b7+ .\nRecall that a positive operator is a self-adjoint operator with a nonnegative spectrum. As the\nelements of E(H) are by definition invertible, \u03b7+ is actually a positive-definite operator, i.e., it\nhas a strictly positive spectrum. Furthermore, given a quasi-Hermitian operator H, the positive\n\u2032\noperator \u03b7+ belonging to E(H) is not unique. But any two such operators \u03b7+ and \u03b7+\nare related\n\u2032\naccording to \u03b7+\n= A\u2020 \u03b7+ A where A is some invertible linear operator commuting with H [3]. It\n\nis also worth emphasizing that there are always infinitely many non-positive elements of E(H);\na quasi-Hermitian operator is always \u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian for some indefinite operator \u03b7. Here\nby the indefiniteness of \u03b7, we means that neither \u03b7 nor \u2212\u03b7 are positive-definite operators.\nA given pseudo-Hermitian operator may or may not be quasi-Hermitian. Hence, quasiHermitian operators form a proper subset of the set of pseudo-Hermitian operators. Similarly,\nthe set of Hermitian operators is a proper subset of the set of quasi-Hermitian operators:\nHermitian \u2282 Quasi-Hermitian \u2282 Pseudo-Hermitian.\nThe main results of the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators are the following spectral\ncharacterization theorems.\nThm. 1: Let H be a separable Hilbert space and H : H \u2192 H be a diagonalizable linear\noperator with a discrete spectrum. Then the following are equivalent. 1.a) H is pseudoHermitian; 1.b) The complex-conjugate of every eigenvalue of H is also an eigenvalue;\n1.c) H commutes with an invertible antilinear operator.\nThm. 2: Let H be a separable Hilbert space and H : H \u2192 H be a linear operator\nwith a discrete spectrum. Then the following are equivalent. 2.a) H is quasi-Hermitian;\n2.b) H is Hermitian with respect to some positive-definite inner product on H; 2.c) H is\na diagonalizable operator with a real spectrum; 2.d) H may be mapped to a Hermitian\noperator by a similarity transformation.\nThe proof of Thm. 1 and a slightly stronger variant of Thm. 2 is given in [1, 2]. Note also that\nin view of Thm. 2, Def. 3 is equivalent to the definition of a quasi-Hermitian operator given in\n[16].\n\n3\n\n\f3\n\nPseudo-Hermiticity and the indefinite-metric vector\nspaces\n\nThe operators \u03b7 entering the discussion of the pseudo-Hermitian operators are sometimes called\nmetric operators. This is because they may be used to define an inner product, namely h*, *i\u03b7 :=\nh*, \u03b7*i, which is a genuine positive-definite inner product if and only if \u03b7 is a positive-definite\noperator. If H happens not to be quasi-Hermitian, then a positive-definite \u03b7 does not exist,\nand the inner product h*, *i\u03b7 with respect to which H is Hermitian (i.e., h*, H*i\u03b7 = hH*, *i\u03b7 )\nis necessarily indefinite. This means that h*, *i\u03b7 satisfies all the defining relations of an inner\nproduct except that there are \u03c8 \u2208 H such that k \u03c8 k2\u03b7 := h\u03c8, \u03c8i\u03b7 \u2264 0.\nEndowing a Hilbert space H with a self-adjoint, invertible, linear operator \u03b7 : H \u2192 H\nturns H into an indefinite-metric vector space H\u03b7 . The linear operators that act in this space\nand are Hermitian with respect to its indefinite inner product h*, *i\u03b7 are precisely the \u03b7-pseudoHermitian operators acting in H. It is the properties of the \u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian operators for a\nfixed \u03b7 that have been studied within the context of the indefinite-metric vector spaces [13, 14].\nThe main difference between the approach pursued in the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators [1, 2, 3] over that of the above-mentioned studies of the indefinite-metric vector spaces\n[13, 14] is that the former does not involve fixing a metric operator \u03b7 from the outset. This\napparently minor difference has remarkable conceptual as well as practical implications. The\nsuperiority of the former approach over the latter is reminiscent of that of General Relativity\nover Special Relativity. This also reminds one of the following important lessons of the history\nof modern physics: 1. The geometrical structures underlying physical theories must not be fixed\naccording to one's wishes or for mere mathematical convenience; 2. Having an arbitrariness in\na construction is an indication of the presence of a symmetry, a quality that is almost always\ndesirable and often useful. Ironically, the tendency to fix a metric operator from the outset and\ndelve in the intricacies of a fixed indefinite-metric vector space, that has been the predominant\nattitude for the past 75 years, is in clear violation of both these principles.\nIn contrast to the historical developments leading to the indefinite-metric quantum theories,\nthe theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators has been formulated in a way as to incorporate the\nfreedom in the choice of the metric operator into the basic structure of the theory. Indeed, the\nrecent application of pseudo-Hermitian operators in addressing some of the outstanding open\nproblems of relativistic quantum mechanics [8, 9] and quantum cosmology [7, 8] makes a direct\nuse of the arbitrariness of the choice of the metric operator. It is perhaps the most recent\nconfirmation of the validity of the views reflected in the above-mentioned lessons of the history\n\n4\n\n\fof modern physics.\nThe particular problems referred to in the preceding paragraph have to do with the existence\nand construction of a conserved positive-definite inner product on the solution space of the\nKlein-Gordon equation and its generalizations that arise as the Wheeler-DeWitt equations in\nquantum cosmology [17]. These are conveniently called Klein-Gordon-type equations [7, 8]. It is\nwell-known that the solution space of such a field equation admits an invariant indefinite inner\nproduct, namely the Klein-Gordon inner product. The indefiniteness of the latter has been\nthe fundamental obstacle for devising a probabilistic interpretation for relativistic quantum\nmechanics and quantum cosmology. The theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators provides a\nsimple and explicit solution for this problem. In the following we include a brief outline of this\nsolution for the free Klein-Gordon equation: [\u2202t2 + D]\u03c8(t, ~x) = 0, where D := \u2212\u22072 + m2 , m is\nthe mass, and c = ~ = 1.\nFirst, we write the Klein-Gordon equation as a Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a two-component\nfield. It is well-known [18] that the corresponding Hamiltonian H is a \u03c33 -pseudo-Hermitian\noperator acting in L2 (R3 ) \u2295 L2 (R3 ), i.e., \u03c33 \u2208 E(H), where \u03c33 is the diagonal Pauli matrix with\ndiagonal entries \u00b11. The Klein-Gordon inner product corresponds to h*, *i\u03c33 which is manifestly\nindefinite. However, it can be easily shown that H is diagonalizable and has a real spectrum\n[7, 8, 9]. Hence according to Thm. 2, E(H) includes positive elements \u03b7+ that can be used to\ndefine a positive-definite inner product h*, *i\u03b7+ . The latter leads to an explicit expression for\na class of positive-definite inner products on the solution space S of Klein-Gordon fields [7].\nBecause all positive-definite inner products on S are unitarily equivalent [8], one may choose\nany one of the inner products obtained in this way to develop a probabilistic quantum theory\nof first-quantized scalar fields. A particularly appealing example is the relativistically invariant\ninner product [9]:\n1\n(\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) :=\n2\u03bc\n\nZ\n\nR3\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd3 x \u03c81 (~x, t)\u2217 D 1/2 \u03c82 (~x, t) + \u2202t \u03c81 (~x, t)\u2217 D \u22121/2 \u2202t \u03c82 (~x, t) .\n\nEndowing S with this inner product and completing the resulting inner product space via\nCauchy completion [19], one obtains a separable Hilbert space that turns out to be most\nconveniently modelled as L2 (R3 ) \u2295 L2 (R3 ). This allows for an explicit construction of a novel\nset of relativistic position operators and the associated localized and coherent states [9].\nIt is remarkable that although this problem was formulated in the late 1920s and examined by some of the founding fathers of both quantum mechanics (QM) and its extension to\nindefinite-metric theories such as Dirac in as early as the 1930s, its solution only appeared recently. The lack of progress in solving this problem during the past 75 years may be traced back\nto the fact that all the workers on the subject preferred to use the indefinite metric operator\n5\n\n\f\u03c33 which looked simple and could be related to the electric charge conservation. It was the\nrecent formulation of the theory of the pseudo-Hermitian operators (and perhaps the fortunate\nignorance of the author about the early literature on the subject at the time) that allowed for\nconsidering other metric operators that were unlike \u03c33 positive-definite.\n\n4\n\nPseudo-Hermitian and indefinte-metric QM\n\nPseudo-Hermitian QM is defined by an auxiliary pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian H \u2032 acting in a\nseparable Hilbert space H\u2032 such that the span K of the eigenvectors of H \u2032 with real eigenvalues\nis nonempty. The physical Hilbert space H and the Hamiltonian H are obtained as follows.\nFirst, one considers the restriction K of H \u2032 onto K as a linear operator acting in the complete\nclosure K\u0304 of K. Then, by construction K is a densely defined quasi-Hermitian operator and\nE(K) includes a positive operator \u03b7+ . Next, one makes a choice for \u03b7+ (noting that all choices\nare unitarily/physically equivalent) and endows K with the inner product h*, *i\u03b7+ so that K may\nbe viewed as a Hermitian operator acting in this inner product space. H and H are respectively\nthe Cauchy completion of K and the closed self-adjoint extension of K to H, [19].\nOne can use the auxiliary Hamiltonian H \u2032 and the Hilbert space H\u2032 to formulate an\nindefinite-metric quantum system. This is simply done by choosing an arbitrary indefinite\n\u03b7 \u2208 E(H \u2032) and defining the nonphysical Hilbert space H\u03b7\u2032 to be the indefinite-metric vector\nspace obtained by endowing H\u2032 (viewed as a complex vector space) with the indefinite inner\nproduct h*, *i\u03b7 , [13]. The physical Hilbert space is then identified with the subspace of H\u03b7\u2032 that\nincludes besides the zero vector the elements that have a positive real norm k * k\u03b7 .\nPerforming the constructions of the indefinite-metric QM for the Klein-Gordon equation,\none arrives at a physical Hilbert space that consists of positive-energy solutions. In contrast,\nthe constructions of the pseudo-Hermitian QM lead to a physical Hilbert space that includes\nthe positive-, zero-, as well as negative-energy solutions. This is a concrete evidence that\npseudo-Hermitian QM is not just the well-known indefinite-metric QM.\nAcknowledgment: This work has been supported by the Turkish Academy of Sciences in\nthe framework of the Young Researcher Award Program (EA-T\u00dcBA-GEB\u0130P/2001-1-1).\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
