Whereas the cosmological principal assumes the Universe to be homogeneous and isotropic, Lorentz invariance\nis required to be a symmetry of any relativistic quantum field theory. These requirements have robust footings, but there can\npossibly be scenarios where these ideas are not sufficient to describe the dynamics of a system. Temperature fluctuations in\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation indicate that the assumptions made by the cosmological principal are not\nperfect. There is no conclusive evidence of Lorentz violation to date but this has been a topic of considerable interest and the\nStandard Model Extension (SME) has been constructed which includes various terms that preserve observer Lorentz transformations but violate particle Lorentz transformations [1]. Limits have been placed on the coefficients of various terms in the SME\nas well [2]. Another important question is the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe which is not completely resolved.\nSakharov, in 1967 derived three conditions (baryon violation, C and CP violation and out of thermal equilibrium) for a theory to\nsatisfy in order to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.\nOrigin of fermion masses is also one of the most intriguing questions which is now close to be answered by the ATLAS\nand CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider. Hints of the Higgs boson have been seen and we will know for sure soon\nwhether it exists or not. The formalism presented in this article might also help us answer these two important questions, namely,\nthe baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the origin of fermion masses.\nWe intend here to describe the evolution of a theory that violates Lorentz invariance to a theory that preserves it. The fields\nthat are involved in the Lorentz violating theory can be viewed in analogy with fields traveling in an anisotropic medium. When\nthe system evolves from the anisotropic to isotropic phase the symmetry of the theory is restored and the partition function\nformalism can be used to better understand how this transition takes place. This formalism, we propose, can help explain the\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In section II and III, we describe these transformations and propose a way to interpret them\nas plane wave transitions into anisotropic media. In section IV, the partition function is used to get a better insight into how the\ntransformations in section II occur. Section V illustrates how some interaction terms lead to Lorentz violating operators which\nare suppressed due to the transition of the system to a Lorentz symmetric phase. We conclude in section VI.\n\nII.\n\nTRANSFORMATIONS LEADING TO COVARIANT DIRAC EQUATION\n\nIn this section we outline a set of transformations that lead to the Dirac equation for a QED (Quantum Electrodynamics) like\ntheory with no interaction terms. The interaction terms will be discussed in section V. We start with a Dirac-like equation which\ninvolves four massless fields (\u03c7a , \u03c7b , \u03c7c , \u03c7d ). These fields can be redefined in a simple way such that the covariant form of the\nDirac equation is restored along with a mass term. In this section we will just consider the kinetic terms for the fields in the\nunderlying theory so as to get the free Dirac equation in covariant form. If we start with the following equation (~ = c = 1):\ni\u03c7 \u0304a \u03b3 0 \u22020 \u03c7a + i\u03c7 \u0304b \u03b3 1 \u22021 \u03c7b + i\u03c7 \u0304c \u03b3 2 \u22022 \u03c7c + i\u03c7 \u0304d \u03b3 3 \u22023 \u03c7d = 0,\n\na\n\nemail: adeel@udel.edu\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nand transform each of the \u03c7 fields in the following manner,\n\u03c7a (x) \u2192 ei\u03b1m\u03b3\n\u03c7c (x) \u2192 ei\u03b4m\u03b3\n\n2\n\n0\n\nx0\n\nx2\n\n\u03c8(x), \u03c7b (x) \u2192 ei\u03b2m\u03b3\n\n\u03c8(x), \u03c7d (x) \u2192 ei\u03c3m\u03b3\n\n1\n\n3\n\nx1\n\nx3\n\n\u03c8(x)\n\n\u03c8(x),\n\nwe get the Dirac equation in covariant form, along with a mass term (using, for e.g., ei\u03b2m\u03b3\n\u03c8(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 (\u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b4 + \u03c3)m)\u03c8 = 0,\n\n(2)\n1\n\nx1\n\n\u03b30 = \u03b30 e\u2212i\u03b2m\u03b3\n\n1\n\nx1\n\n),\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4 and \u03c3 are real positive constants. For plane wave solution for particles, \u03c8 = e\u2212ip.x u(p), the above redefinition\nfor the field \u03c7a , for example, is a solution of the following equation:\n\u2202\n\u03c7a (x) = \u2212i(E \u2212 \u03b1m\u03b30 )\u03c7a (x),\n\u2202t\n\n(4)\n\nwith similar equations for the other fields. Equation (4), is similar to equation (27) in reference [3] which is a solution of the\ndifferential equation governing linear elastic motions in an anisotropic medium (with a constant matrix, see section III of the\nreference). With \u03b1 = 0 the left hand side is just the Hamiltonian, with the plane wave its eigenstate.\nNote that the manner in which we can transform equation (1) to (3) is not unique and there are various ways to do this with\ndifferent combinations of the \u03c7 fields along with the field \u03c8. A mass term (m\u03c7\u03c7) for the \u03c7 fields could have been added to\nequation (1), but the transformations (2) can be used to eliminate it. So, if we want our resulting equation to describe a massive\nfermion, these fields should be massless or cannot have mass term of the form m\u03c7\u03c7. This argument will be further corroborated\n0\nwith the results we present in section IV. The transformation matrices in equation (2) are not all unitary, the matrix ei\u03b1m\u03b3 x0 is\ni\nunitary while the rest (ei\u03b2m\u03b3 xi ) are hermitian.\nThe fields in equation (1) can be considered as independent degrees of freedom satisfying equation (4) in an underlying theory\nthat violates Lorentz invariance. The transformations (2) can, therefore, be seen as reducing the degrees of freedom of the theory\nfrom four to one. In such an underlying theory, various interaction terms can be written for these fields. Since we intend to obtain\nthe free Dirac equation, we have considered only kinetic terms involving the fields \u03c7. A quadratic term involving different \u03c7\nfields (m\u03c7i \u03c7j ) can be added to equation (1) but this leads to a term that violates Lorentz invariance in the resulting Dirac\nequation. A quartic term (c\u03c7i \u03c7i \u03c7j \u03c7j ) is possible and would result in a dimension 6 operator for the field \u03c8 with the constant c\nsuppressed by the square of a cutoff scale. So, with the restriction that the resulting Dirac equation only contains terms that are\nLorentz scalars the number of terms we can write for the \u03c7 fields can be limited. In other words we impose Lorentz symmetry\nin the resulting equation so that various terms vanish or have very small coefficients. The interaction terms are further discussed\nin section V of the paper.\n\nIII.\n\nVISUALIZING FIELD REDEFINITIONS\n\nWe can visualize a global and a local transformation as transitions of plane waves to different types of media. The wave\nfunction of a particle, for example, which comes across a potential barrier (E > V ) of a finite width and height undergoes a\nphase rotation (eikl \u03c8) upon transmission. If the width of the barrier extends to infinity, the wave function can be viewed as\nundergoing a position dependent phase rotation (eikx \u03c8). The transformations (2) can similarly be seen as a plane wave entering\nan anisotropic medium. A phenomenon in optics called birefringence can be used to explain why these four fields map on to the\nsame field \u03c8. Birefringence results in a plane wave splitting into two distinct waves inside a medium having different refractive\nindices along different directions in a crystal. These analogies can serve as crude sketches to visualize how the transformations\nin equation (2) can occur.\nWhen a polarized electromagnetic plane wave enters a birefringent material, the wave splits into two distinct waves. This can\nbe also be seen as a change in the coordinate system of the wave. Similarly, transformations (2) can be seen as rotation of the\nfield \u03c8 in spinor space or the transition of a wave in a material that splits the field \u03c8 into four distinct waves and is anisotropic.\nBased on the latter view, we propose a transition from an anisotropic to isotropic phase in the early Universe whereby it became\nLorentz symmetric. So the form of equation (1) is not a bizarre choice of basis for writing the equation but a possible form of\nthe equation in an anisotropic space-time. The difference also comes from the interaction terms of these fields, which we shall\ndiscuss in section V. The interaction terms of the fields \u03c7 that are due to the anisotropic character of space-time get enhanced in\nthe anisotropic phase. As the transition takes place these terms become suppressed. This would not be the case if we just choose\na different basis to write the equation. The suppression of the anisotropy is interpreted as the reduction of entropy or increase in\norder of the system discussed in section IV.\nSpace-time dependent field redefinitions\nin the usual Dirac Lagrangian result in violation of Lorentz invariance. For example,\n\u03bc\nthe field redefinition \u03c8 \u2192 e\u2212ia x\u03bc \u03c8 leads to the Lorentz violating terms in the Lagrangian [1]. This particular redefinition,\nhowever, would not lead to physically observable effects for a single fermion. A transformation of this type amounts to shifting\n\n\f3\nthe four momentum of the field. It can also be viewed in analogy with plane waves entering another medium of a different\nrefractive index which results in a change in the wave number of the transmitted wave. Similarly, transformations (2) can be\ninterpreted as transitions of a wave from an anisotropic to isotropic medium or vice versa as done in the Stroh's matrix formalism\n[3].\nFor plane wave solutions of \u03c8, the \u03c7 fields have propagative, exponentially decaying and increasing solutions (for example,\ne\u00b1imx , e\u00b1mx ). This wave behavior is similar to that in an anisotropic medium or a medium made of layers of anisotropic\nmedium. The eigenvalues of the Dirac matrices being the wave numbers of these waves in this case. The coefficients in the\nexponent relates to how fast the wave oscillates, decays and/or increases exponentially. The transfer matrix in Stroh's formalism\ndescribe the properties of the material and in this case can possibly represent the properties of the anisotropic phase from which\nthe transition to the isotropic phase occurs.\nIn the usual symmetry breaking mechanism a Higgs field acquires a vacuum expectation value (VEV) and the resulting mass\nterm does not respect the symmetry of the underlying group. For example, in the Standard Model, due to its chiral nature, a\nHiggs field is introduced in order to manifest gauge invariance. Once the Higgs field acquires a VEV the mass term only respects\nthe symmetry of the resulting group which is U(1)EM . In our case the mass term arises after symmetry of the Dirac equation is\nrestored. Consider the simple case where we have one field \u03c7a in addition to the field \u03c8:\ni\u03c7 \u0304a \u03b3 0 \u22020 \u03c7a + i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 i \u2202i \u03c8 = 0,\n\n(5)\n\n0\n\nand this field transforms to the field \u03c8 as \u03c7a (x) \u2192 ei\u03b1m\u03b3 x0 \u03c8(x), leading to the Dirac equation. In order to discuss the\nsymmetries of the above equation let's assume that the two independent degrees of freedom are described by the above equation.\nEquation (5) then has two independent global U(1) symmetries and the resulting equation has one. In fact, there is a list of\ni\nsymmetries of equation (5) not possessed by (3), for example invariance under local transformations, \u03c7a \u2192 eib \u03b8(xi ) \u03c7\u2032a (i, j =\n1, 2, 3), where bi can be a constant vector, the matrix \u03b30 or any matrix that commutes with \u03b30 (e.g., \u03c3ij , \u03b35 \u03b3i ). This implies\ninvariance under global and local SO(3) transformations (rotations of the fields \u03c7a but not boosts). Similarly, \u03c8 \u2192 eiA \u03b8(t) \u03c8 \u2032\nis a symmetry, where A can be a constant or the matrix i\u03b30 \u03b35 which commutes with the three Dirac matrices \u03b3i . After the\ntransformation \u03c7a \u2192 eim\u03b30 t \u03c8 the equation is no more invariant under these symmetries and the SO(1,3) symmetry of the Dirac\nequation is restored along with a global U(1) symmetry.\n\nIV. PARTITION FUNCTION AS A TRANSFER MATRIX\n\nIn the early Universe, a transition from a Lorentz asymmetric to a symmetric phase could possibly induce transformations of\nthe form (2). Let's again consider the simple example in equation (5). For this case the eigenvalues of the Dirac matrix \u03b30 define\nthe wave numbers of the waves traveling in the anisotropic medium. The direction of anisotropy in this case is the temporal\ndirection, which means that the time evolution of these waves is not like usual plane waves. It is not straight forward to visualize\nthe fields, the dynamics of whom are described by the anisotropy of space time, but we can use the partition function method to\nget a better insight into this. We can, by using this formalism, calculate the temperature at which the transformations in equation\n(2) occur.\nWe next perform a transition to a thermodynamics system by making the transformation it \u2192 \u03b2, where \u03b2 = 1/kB T [4]. The\npartition function is then given by the trace of the transformation matrix eim\u03b30 t ,\nZ = Tr(em\u03b2\u03b30 ) = 2e\u03b2m + 2e\u2212\u03b2m .\n\n(6)\n\nIn order to represent the transition of the system with the above partition function the temporal transfer matrix should be unitary.\nThis partition function is similar to that of a two-level system of spin 1/2 particles localized on a lattice and placed in a magnetic\nfield with each state, in this case, having a degeneracy of two. The lower energy state corresponding to spin parallel to the\nfield (E = \u2212m, Z1 = e\u03b2m ). In this case the doubly degenerate states correspond to spins up and down of the particle or antiparticle. For N distinguishable particles the partition function is Z N , N here is the total number of particles and antiparticles of\na particular species. So, we are modeling our system as being on a lattice with the spin along the field as representing a particle\nand spin opposite to the field representing an antiparticle.\nThe evolution of this system with temperature represents the time evolution of the system in equation (1). In other words the\npartition function describes the evolution of these waves from anisotropic to isotropic phase as the temperature decreases. For a\ntwo level system the orientation of the dipole moments becomes completely random for large enough temperatures so that there\nis no net magnetization. In our case we can introduce another quantity, namely a gravitational dipole, which would imply that\nthe four states (particle/antiparticle, spin up/down) of N such particles at high enough temperatures orient themselves in a way\nthat the system is massless. This just serves as an analogy and does not mean that the masses are orientating themselves the\nsame way as dipoles would do in space.

Plot of heat capacity CV for the mass of electron, up quark, neutrino and W boson. The maximum of the heat capacity of the\nelectron occurs at 4.8 \u00d7 109 K, for the up quarks is 1.9 \u00d7 1013 K, for neutrinos is 291K and for the W bosons is 7.8 \u00d7 1014 K. We use\nkB = 8.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV/K and m\u03bd = 0.03 eV.\n\nlevel system. The population of a particular energy level is given by,\nnp(p) =\n\nN e\u00b1\u03b2m\n.\ne\u03b2m + e\u2212\u03b2m\n\n(7)\n\nWhich shows that the number density of particles and antiparticles vary in a different way with respect to temperature. In\nthe early Universe, therefore the anisotropic character of space-time seems to play an important role such that particles and\nanti-particles behave in different manners. As the temperature decreases the number density of the anti-particles decreases and\nis vanishingly small for small temperatures (\u223c e\u22122\u03b2m ). When the decoupling temperature is attained there is a difference in\nthe number density of the particles and antiparticles as described by equation (7). This leads to an excess of particles over\nantiparticles. The decoupling temperature of a particular species of particle with mass m and which is non-relativistic is given\nby, kB T . 2m. Below this temperature the particles annihilate to photons but the photons do not have enough energy to produce\nthe pair. This can be used to get the ratio of antiparticles over particles (matter radiation decoupling). For \u03b2m \u2248 0.5, we get,\nnp \u2212 np\n\u2248 0.6 .\nnp\n\n(8)\n\nWhich implies an excess of particles over antiparticles and thus can serve as another possible way to explain the matter antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. This number is very large compared to the one predicted by standard cosmology (\u223c 10\u22129 ).\nThe above expression yields this order for \u03b2m \u2248 10\u22129 which implies a large temperature. For electrons this would imply\na temperature of the order 1018 K which is large and the electrons are relativistic. So if we assume that the decoupling takes\nplace at a higher temperature, the baryon asymmetry can be explained. Even without this assumption the conditions proposed by\nSakharov can also enhance the number of particles over the antiparticles. Sakharov's conditions involve the interaction dynamics\nof the fields in the early Universe whereas in our case the statistical system serves more as a model describing the dynamics of\nspace-time to a more ordered phase.\nStatistical mechanics, therefore, enables us to visualize this transition in a rather lucid way. In a two level system the net\nmagnetization at any given temperature is analogous to the excess of particles over antiparticles in the early Universe. The\ntime evolution of this anisotropic to isotropic transition is modeled on the evolution of a statistical thermodynamics system with\nparticles on a lattice placed in a magnetic field. The particles on the lattice are localized, static and have no mutual interaction.\n\n\f5\nThe free energy of the system is given by:\nF = \u2212N kB T ln{4cosh [m\u03b2]}\nFrom this we can calculate the entropy S, heat capacity CV and mean energy U of the system:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202F\nS=\u2212\n\u2202T V\n= N kB ln {4 cosh [m\u03b2]} \u2212 mkB \u03b2 tanh [m\u03b2]\nU = F + T S = \u2212N m tanh [m\u03b2]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202U\n= N kB m2 \u03b2 2 sech2 [m\u03b2]\nCV =\n\u2202T V\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n\nIn Fig.1, the peaks in the heat capacity represent phase transition of a particular particle species. These are second order phase\ntransitions and the peak in the heat capacity is usually referred to as the Schottky anomaly [5]. Note that the phase transition\nwe model our system on is a magnetic one. So, modeling the complex system in the early Universe on a lattice with spin 1/2\nparticles can reduce the complications of the actual system by a considerable amount.\nThe Schottky anomaly of such a magnetic system, therefore, represents phase transitions in the early Universe. For a particular\nspecies of particles the Schottky anomaly shows a peak around mc2 \u2248 kT . The phase transition for the electrons occurs at the\ntemperature where nuclei start forming in the early Universe. For the quarks the transition temperature refers to confinement\ninto protons and neutrons. Similarly, W boson's transition occurs at the electroweak breaking scale. The W boson, being a spin\n1 particle, is not described by the Dirac equation, but the heat capacity entails this feature of showing a phase transition for the\nenergy scale relevant to the mass of a particle.\nThe curve for neutrinos implies that the transition temperature for neutrinos is around 291 K, which means that the density\nof antineutrinos from the big bang for present neutrino background temperatures (\u223c 2 K) is not negligible. The ratio of antineutrinos over neutrinos for T = 2 K, is n\u03bd /n\u03bd = e\u22122\u03b2m\u03bd \u223c 10\u221215000 (m\u03bd = 2 eV). For an even smaller neutrino mass,\nm\u03bd = 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV, the ratio is n\u03bd /n\u03bd \u223c 0.3, which for other more massive particles is much smaller. A cosmic neutrino\nand antineutrino background is one of the predictions of standard cosmology but is still unobserved. This model predicts an\nantineutrino background much less than the neutrino one.\nIn Fig.2, the plots of mean energy and entropy are shown in dimensionless units. In the massless limit for fermions, the\nentropy attains its maximum value of N kB ln4. The plots show that the energy of the system approaches zero as the temperature\napproaches infinity. This situation is analogous to the spins being completely random at high temperatures for the two level\nsystem. The same way that the magnetic energy of the system on the lattice is zero at high temperatures, the mass of this system\nis zero in the very early Universe. As the temperature decreases the energy of the system attains it minimum value (U = \u2212N m)\nand the particles become massive at the temperature less than the value given by the peak of the heat capacity. The entropy for\nhigh temperatures asymptotically approaches its maximum value of N kB ln4.\nThe value of the parameter kB T/m at the peak of the heat capacity curves gives the temperature at which the transition takes\nplace for a particular species. The transition for each field, therefore, depends on the energy scale relevant to its mass. So,\nthis means that each field was experiencing the anisotropy of space time in a different manner whereas space-time itself was\nexpanding towards a Lorentz symmetric phase. This can be understood if we imagine a material with anisotropies. Plane waves\nof different wavelengths inside the material experience the anisotropies in different ways. So the analogy discussed in section III\ntells us that the more massive the field, the faster it will oscillate, exponentially increase or decrease. A less massive field having\na larger wavelength (\u03bb = ~/mc) therefore would experience the anisotropies when their scale is much larger.\nAccording to the statistical thermodynamics model that describes this transition, as this phase transition occurs antiparticles\nwill start changing into particles and as can be seen from the figure the system will move towards all spins aligned parallel\nwith the \"field\", i.e., towards being particles. From Fig.2 we can see that the energy of the system starts attaining the minimum\nvalue as the temperature decreases where all particles are aligned with the field and are \"particles\". The plot of entropy vs.\ntemperature also represents an important feature of these transformations. The entropy decreases with decreasing temperature\nand this represents the transition to a more ordered phase using equations (2). The plots of energy of the system U in Fig.2 show\nthat the system will eventually settle down to the lowest energy state which in this case means that the system will have almost\nall particles with negligible number of antiparticles. In short, the plot of the heat capacity reflects the phase transitions, the plot\nof energy U represents the transition from massless to massive states and the plot of entropy represents the transition of space\ntime to a more ordered phase.\nThe Big Bang theory is one of the most promising candidates to describe how the Universe began. According to this theory,\nthe Universe expanded from a singularity where curved space-time, being locally Minkowskian, eventually became flat. It is\npossible that there even was a transition to the Minkowski space from a non-Minkowski one. If the Universe began with a\nstate of maximum entropy than we can very well assume that space-time was not Minkowskian even locally. The fields that\ndwell in space-time are representation of the symmetry group that describes it.

Plot of entropy and energy for a particle of mass m. For large enough temperatures the energy of the system approaches zero and the\nentropy approaches the limiting value of N kB ln4.\n\nby equation (1), are therefore, not representations of the Lorentz group. The CPT theorem assumes symmetries of Minkowski\nspace-time in implying the similarities between particles and antiparticles. If the underlying theory is not Minkowskian than\nparticles and antiparticles can behave differently and this is what the model described in this section implies.\nThe occurrence of the Schottky anomaly has motivated the study of negative temperatures [6]. Note that the partition functions\nis invariant under the transformation T \u2192 \u2212T but the equations for the free energy, entropy and energy are not. The existence\nof negative temperatures has been observed in experiments. Negative temperatures, for example, can be realized in a system of\nspins if the direction of the magnetic field is suddenly reversed for a system of spins initially aligned with the magnetic field [5].\nSimilarly, as described in reference [6] the allowed states of the system must have an upper limit. Whereas this is not the case\nfor the actual particles in the early Universe, the statistical mechanics system on which it can be modeled on has this property.\nA negative temperature system would eventually settle down to the lower energy state (U = N m) which in our case would\nmean that the Universe would ends up having more antiparticles than particles. This is yet another interesting insight we get by\nmodeling the early Universe on a two state system.\nThe system on the lattice eventually has only spins aligned with the field and which are interpreted as particles. This means\nthat the partition function can be written as,\nZ = e\u03b2m = e(\u2212\u03b2)(\u2212m) .\nWhich implies that the system can eventually be seen as spins aligned towards the field evolving in a positive temperature system\nor spins aligned opposite to the field evolving in a negative temperature system. This gives a correlation of particles with positive\ntemperature systems and antiparticles with negative temperature systems. This view in a way coincides with the fact that the\nresulting space-time configuration describes both particles and antiparticles in a similar but independent way.\nWe can also notice that in the statistical system modeled for the transition, the reason due to which entropy of the system\ndecreases is the presence of an external field. As in a paramagnet, the spins remain randomly align in the absence of a magnetic\nfield. In the system considered, spins interact with the magnetic field and not with each other. It is difficult to say what played\nthe role of this field in the early Universe, but since the field is the reason entropy reduces, there should be a physical quantity\npresent in the early Universe playing an analogous role. This quantity, for instance, can be speculated to be the expansion of the\nUniverse.\n\nV.\n\nINTERACTION TERMS AND THE SME\n\nIn section II we only considered terms in the underlying theory that lead to the free Dirac equation. In this section we shall\ninclude some interaction terms and see how they lead to LV operators one of which is considered in the SME. Since we do\nnot have Lorentz symmetry, the underlying theory can have a large number of terms. We will therefore restrict ourselves to\ninteraction terms that lead to dimension 4 operators and only involve the gamma matrices. Also, the form of the Dirac equation\nrestricts the number of ways we can start with an underlying LV theory. In the following we add a few interaction terms to\nequation (1):\ni\u03c7 \u0304a \u03b3 0 \u22020 \u03c7a + i\u03c7 \u0304b \u03b3 1 \u22021 \u03c7b + i\u03c7 \u0304c \u03b3 2 \u22022 \u03c7c + i\u03c7 \u0304d \u03b3 3 \u22023 \u03c7d + I1int + I2int = 0,\n\n(13)\n\n\f7\nwhere I1int and I2int include operators that lead to dimension 4 LV operators after the transformations,\nI1int = c1 \u03c7a \u03b3 0 \u03c7a a0 + c3 \u03c7b \u03b3 1 \u03c7b a1 + c5 \u03c7c \u03b3 2 \u03c7c a2 + c7 \u03c7d \u03b3 3 \u03c7d a3\n+ c9 \u03c7a \u03b3 0 \u03b35 \u03c7a b0 + c11 \u03c7b \u03b3 1 \u03b35 \u03c7b b1 + c13 \u03c7c \u03b3 2 \u03b35 \u03c7c b2 + c15 \u03c7d \u03b3 3 \u03b35 \u03c7d b3 + .... ,\nI2int = c2 m\u03c7a \u03c7b + c6 \u03c7a \u03b3 0 \u03c7b a0 + c4 \u03c7b \u03b3 1 \u03c7c a1 + c6 \u03c7c \u03b3 2 \u03c7d a2 + c8 \u03c7d \u03b3 3 \u03c7a a3 + ... ,\nwhere I1int includes interaction terms of the same fields and I2int involve different fields. As the system transits to a more ordered\nphase using (2) the coefficients of the terms leading to LV operators become suppressed. For example, after the transformations,\nthe terms in I1int would lead to the term in the SME with coefficient a\u03bc . The term \u03c8\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8a\u03bc in the SME do not have any physical\n\u03bc\neffects for a single fermion since the term can be canceled with a redefinition of the field \u03c8 \u2192 eia x\u03bc \u03c8, but can have physical\neffects if the theory has more than one fermions. Note that the SME term \u03c8\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 \u03c8b\u03bc with a constant b\u03bc is not generated from\nI1int .\nThe coefficients ci are dimensionless quantities which measure the anisotropies of the system and therefore can be taken to\nbe proportional to the entropy S/kB of the system in equation (10). As the system moves towards a Lorentz symmetric phase\nthe entropy approaches zero and therefore the coefficients become vanishingly small. We can also impose four global U(1)\nsymmetries in equation (13) and this would forbid the terms in I2int . The symmetries can then be gauged to get interactions\nof each of the \u03c7 fields with each component of the gauge field (e.g. \u03c7a \u03b3 0 \u03c7a A0 (x)) and this would convert to the usual gauge\ninteraction term in the resulting covariant Dirac equation.\nAs mentioned earlier, the properties of the gamma matrices and the form of the Dirac equation restricts the ways we can start\nwith an underlying LV theory. The gamma matrices commute with only the identity matrix and anti-commute with \u03b35 . The other\npossible way to start with an underlying theory is to use the \u03b35 matrix. If we just include the \u03b35 matrix with the gamma matrices\nin (1) than we do not retrieve the Dirac equation. This is also the case when the \u03b35 matrix is included in the transformations.\nHowever, if we start with both a \u03b35 in the equation (e.g. \u03c7a \u03b3 0 \u03b35 \u22020 \u03c7a ) and perform the transformations (2) with a \u03b35 (e.g.\n0\n\u03c7a \u2192 eim\u03b3 \u03b35 t \u03c8) than the Dirac equation is retrieved with a \u03b35 and this can be rotated away with a redefinition of the field \u03c8\nin the free Dirac equation. Since the temporal transfer matrix is not unitary in this case, the analogy made in section IV will not\napply and we get an oscillating partition function. This would also effect the resulting LV terms we get in the SME. In this case\nwe get a term \u03c8\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 \u03c8b\u03bc with a constant four vector b\u03bc , whereas a\u03bc is not constant in \u03c8\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8a\u03bc .\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nConsidering that the Dirac equation can be written in the form of an underlying theory that violates Lorentz invariance,\nwe suggest that such a transition took place for fermions in the early Universe. We propose that space-time was not Lorentz\nsymmetric and that a gradual transition to the Lorentz symmetric phase occurred. The fields in the underlying Lorentz violating\ntheory are massless and transformations were performed that restore the Dirac equation to its covariant form along with a mass\nterm for the fermions.\nThe underlying theory depicting the Lorentz violating phase has interaction terms of the fields. As the transition takes place,\nthese interaction terms result in suppressed Lorentz violating terms some of which can be identified with terms in the SME\n(Standard Model Extension). The partition function formalism is then used to model these transformations on the evolution of\na system of spin 1/2 particles on a lattice placed in a magnetic field. Symmetry breaking in this case takes place on this lattice,\nwhereas, it is restored in the Dirac equation. The transition to the Lorentz symmetric phase in the early Universe can be modeled\non this thermodynamic system.\nThe behavior of the fields in the anisotropic phase is suggested to be similar to that of plane waves in anisotropic media. The\neigenvalues of the transfer matrices give the wavenumbers of the waves in the anisotropic media. The wavelengths given by the\ntemporal transfer matrix (~/mc) show that each fermion field experienced the anisotropy of space-time in different ways. The\nreason entropy decreases in the statistical system is the presence of an external magnetic field. The expansion of the Universe\nis interpreted as playing this role. The fields with small masses, and hence large wavelengths, undergo phase transitions later as\nthe scale of the anisotropies get larger with the expansion.\nWe showed that modeling the transition in such a manner can describe three important features of the early Universe: (1) The\nheat capacity shows occurrence of phase transitions. (2) The mean energy of the system shows how the particles became massive\nfrom being massless. (3) The plot of entropy depicts the occurrence of a transition to a more ordered phase interpreted as the\nLorentz symmetric phase. At any given temperature the net magnetization measures the excess of particles over antiparticles.\nWe suggest that this model can be used to explain the matter antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. Also, since space-time is\nnot Minkowskian in the underlying theory, the CPT theorem does not hold, implying a difference in the behavior of particles\nand antiparticles. This is in agreement with the analogy created with the statistical system whereby spin up and down particles\nbehave in different ways with the evolution of the system. This formalism can arguably serve as another possible way to explain\nthe origin of fermion masses till the final results related to the Higgs boson are presented.\n\n\f8\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe author would like to express his deep gratitude to Alan Kostelecky and Dmitry Gorbunov for very fruitful discussions\nand suggestions.
