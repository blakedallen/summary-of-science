The latest experimental data are first analyzed in the diagrammatic approach. The\nmagnitudes and strong phases of the flavor amplitudes are extracted from the Cabibbo-favored\n(CF) decay modes using \u03c72 minimization. The best-fitted values are then used to predict the\nbranching fractions of the singly-Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) and doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed decay modes in the flavor SU(3) symmetry limit. We observe significant SU(3) breaking effects in\nsome of SCS channels. In the case of V P modes, we point out that the AP and AV amplitudes\ncannot be completely determined based on currently available data. We conjecture that the quoted\nexperimental results for both Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ and Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 are overestimated. We compare the\nsizes of color-allowed and color-suppressed tree amplitudes extracted from the diagrammatical approach with the effective parameters a1 and a2 defined in the factorization approach. The ratio\n|a2 /a1 | is more or less universal among the D \u2192 K\u0304\u03c0, K\u0304 \u2217 \u03c0 and K\u0304\u03c1 modes. This feature allows\n\nus to discriminate between different solutions of topological amplitudes. For the long-standing\npuzzle about the ratio \u0393(D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 )/\u0393(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), we argue that, in addition to the SU(3)\n\nbreaking effect in the spectator amplitudes, the long-distance resonant contribution through the\nnearby resonance f0 (1710) can naturally explain why D 0 decays more copiously to K + K \u2212 than\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 through the W -exchange topology. This has to do with the dominance of the scalar glueball\ncontent of f0 (1710) and the chiral-suppression effect in the decay of a scalar glueball into two\npseudoscalar mesons. The same FSI also explains the occurrence of D 0 \u2192 K 0 K\u0304 0 and its vanishing\n\namplitude when SU(3) flavor symmetry is exact. Owing to the G-parity selection rule, Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9\n\ndoes not receive contributions from the short-distance W -annihilation and resonant FSIs, but it\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ncan proceed through the weak decays Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 ( ) followed by the final-state rescattering of \u03c1+ \u03b7 ( )\n\ninto \u03c0 + \u03c9 through quark exchange.\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe hadronic decays of charmed mesons and related physics have been studied extensively in the\n\npast 35 years since the first discovery of charmed meson states in 1974. The experimental progress\nis still impressive. For example, many hadronic multibody decays of D 0 , D + and Ds+ mesons have\nbeen studied using the technique of Dalitz plot analysis in which the resonant structure is probed.\nThe Dalitz analysis offers the opportunity to understand the light scalar meson spectroscopy and\nthe underlying structure of light scalar mesons \u03c3, \u03ba, a0 (980) and f0 (980). The study of charm\nphysics also opens a new avenue to the search of new physics. For example, the recent observation\nof D 0 \u2212 D\u0304 0 mixing will enable us to explore new physics via flavor-changing neutral currents in\nthe up-type quark sector. The standard model predicts almost null CP asymmetries in the charm\n\nsystem. Hence, any observation of CP violation in hadronic charm decays will signal physics beyond\nthe standard model.\nWith the advent of heavy quark effective theory, it is known that physics of nonleptonic B\ndecays can be formulated in a QCD-inspired approach such as QCD factorization, pQCD and\nsoft-collinear effective theory. However, until today a theoretical description of the underlying\nmechanism for exclusive hadronic D decays based on QCD is still not yet available. This has to do\nwith the mass of the charm quark, of order 1.5 GeV. It is not heavy enough to allow for a sensible\nheavy quark expansion and it is not light enough for the application of chiral perturbation theory.\nIt is known that the na\u0131\u0308ve factorization approach fails to describe color-suppressed (class-II) decay\nmodes. Empirically, it was learned in the 1980s that if the Fierz-transformed terms characterized\nby 1/Nc are dropped, the discrepancy between theory and experiment will be greatly improved\n[1]. This leads to the so-called large-Nc approach for hadronic D decays [2]. Theoretically, explicit\ncalculations based on the QCD sum-rule analysis [3] indicate that the Fierz terms are indeed largely\ncompensated by the nonfactorizable corrections. However, the 1/Nc ansatz is not applicable to B\ndecays.\nIn spite of the difficulties in formulating a theoretical framework for describing nonleptonic\ndecays of charmed mesons, a model-independent analysis of charm decays based on the diagrammatic approach is possible. In this approach, the flavor-flow diagrams are classified according to\nthe topologies of weak interactions with all strong interaction effects included. Based on flavor\nSU(3) symmetry, this model-independent analysis enables us to extract the topological amplitudes\nand sense the relative importance of different underlying decay mechanisms. When enough measurements are made with sufficient accuracy, we can extract the diagrammatic amplitudes from\nexperiment and compare to theoretical estimates, especially checking whether there are any significant final-state interactions or whether the weak annihilation diagrams can be ignored as often\nasserted in the literature.\nA salient feature of the diagrammatic approach analysis of charm decays is that, unlike the\nB decays, the magnitude and relative strong phase of each individual topological diagram can\n\n2\n\n\fbe extracted from the data without making further assumptions apart from flavor SU(3) symmetry. Explicitly, the color-allowed amplitude T , the color-suppressed amplitude C, W -exchange\namplitude E and W -annihilation amplitude A in Cabibbo-allowed D \u2192 P P decays can be cleanly\n\nextracted from the data. Recall that the ratio |C/T | in charmless B decays cannot be unambiguously determined due to the contamination of electroweak penguin or weak annihilation diagrams\nand that weak annihilation topologies in the B sector are usually neglected in the diagrammatic\napproach analysis.\nThe topological diagram analysis of D decays evidently shows the importance of weak annihilation (W -exchange or W -annihilation) contributions. Since the short-distance weak annihilation\namplitude is subject to helicity suppression, this implies that long-distance weak annihilation induced by final-state interactions should play an essential role.\nIn this work we shall study the two-body hadronic charmed meson decays, including both the\nP P and V P modes. We first analyze the latest experimental data in the diagrammatic approach.\nFor D \u2192 P P decays, there are new CLEO measurements with better precision [4]. There are two\n\ndifferent ways of extracting the topological amplitudes for D \u2192 V P decays. We shall present both\n\nresults and make a comparison between them. At present, there exist many possible solutions for\nthe flavor amplitudes. We will study the effective parameters a1 and a2 defined in the factorization\napproach and use them as a means to discriminate among different solutions. Another goal of this\nwork is to see if we can understand the SU(3) breaking effects occurring in the SCS modes, in\nthe hope of shedding more light on or even resolving the long-standing puzzle with the ratio of\nD 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 to D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 branching fractions.\n\nThe layout of the present paper is as follows. After a brief review of the diagrammatic approach,\n\nwe extract magnitudes and strong phases of the flavor amplitudes from CF D \u2192 P P and D \u2192 V P\n\ndecays in Sec. II. From the extracted invariant amplitudes, we determine the effective parameters\na1 and a2 defined in the factorization approach in Sec. III and proceed to discuss SU(3) breaking\neffects in singly-Cabibbo-suppressed modes. Using the branching fraction ratio of D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212\n\nto D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 as an example, we illustrate how to explain the large SU(3) violation in the ratio\n\nby considering the W -exchange topology induced by the nearby resonance. Sec. IV comes to our\nconclusions.\nFor nice and comprehensive reviews of exclusive hadronic charmed meson decays, the reader is\nreferred to Refs. [5, 6].\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nDIAGRAMMATIC APPROACH\nA.\n\nPreamble\n\nIt has been established sometime ago that a least model-dependent analysis of heavy meson\ndecays can be carried out in the so-called quark-diagram approach 1 . In this diagrammatic scenario,\nall two-body nonleptonic weak decays of heavy mesons can be expressed in terms of six distinct\nquark diagrams [7\u20139]:2 T , the color-allowed external W -emission tree diagram; C, the colorsuppressed internal W -emission diagram; E, the W -exchange diagram; A, the W -annihilation\ndiagram; P , the horizontal W -loop diagram; and V , the vertical W -loop diagram. (The one-gluon\nexchange approximation of the P graph is the so-called \"penguin diagram\".) It should be stressed\nthat these diagrams are classified according to the topologies of weak interactions with all strong\ninteraction effects encoded, and hence they are not Feynman graphs. All quark graphs used in\nthis approach are topological and meant to have all the strong interactions included, i.e., gluon\nlines are included implicitly in all possible ways. Therefore, analyses of topological graphs can\nprovide information on final-state interactions (FSIs). Various topological amplitudes in two-body\nhadronic D decays have been extracted from the data in [11\u201318] after making some reasonable\napproximations, e.g., flavor SU(3) symmetry.\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nFor charm decays involving an SU(3) singlet in the final product, e.g., D 0 \u2192 K \u03c6, K \u03c9, K \u03b70 ,\n\nthere exist additional hairpin diagrams in which a quark-antiquark pair is created from vacuum\nto form a color- and flavor-singlet final-state meson [19, 20]. There are four different types of\ndisconnected hairpin diagrams: Eh , Ah , Ph , Vh corresponding to the topological graphs E, A, P, V\n(for details, see [19]). The amplitudes Eh and Ah are denoted by SE and SA, respectively, in\nRef. [12]. They appear in final states with \u03b7 (\u2032) for the P P modes and with \u03c6, \u03c9, and/or \u03b7 (\u2032) for the\nP V modes. A test of their importance has been proposed in [12]. As they are still not strongly\ncalled for phenomenologically (see discussions in Section II B), we will ignore these diagrams in\nthe current analysis. For hadronic charm decays, contributions from the diagrams P and V are\n\u2217V\n\u2217\nnegligible due to the cancellation of the CKM matrix elements Vcd\nud and Vcs Vus .\n\nFor final states involving an \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 , it is more convenient to consider the flavor mixing of \u03b7q\nand \u03b7s defined by\n1\n \u0304\n\u03b7q = \u221a (u\u016b + dd),\n2\n\n\u03b7s = ss\u0304,\n\n(1)\n\nin analogy with the wave functions of \u03c9 and \u03c6 in ideal mixing. The wave functions of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032\n1\n2\n\nIt is also referred to as flavor-diagram or topological-diagram approach in the literature.\nHistorically, the quark-graph amplitudes T, C, E, A, P named in [10] were originally denoted by\nA, B, C, D, E, respectively, in [7, 9].

Experimental data\non the branching fractions are taken from the most recent CLEO measurements [4]. We shall follow\nthe conventional practice to denote the primed amplitudes for SCS modes and double-primed amplitudes for DCS decays. In the SU(3) limit, primed and unprimed amplitudes should be the same.\nNote that the selection rule for a vanishing Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 follows from the isospin transformation\n\nproperties of the weak Hamiltonian and isospin invariance of strong interactions and hence it is\nunaffected by SU(3) breaking or final-state interactions [24].\nFor D \u2192 P P decays, the amplitudes T, C, E, A have dimensions of energy as they are related\n\nto the partial decay rate via\n\n\u0393(D \u2192 P P ) =\n3\n\npc\n|A|2 ,\n8\u03c0m2D\n\n(6)\n\n\u221a\nFor the mixing angle \u03c6 = arc sin(1/ 3) = 35.26\u25e6 , the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 wave functions have simple expressions\n\u221a\n\u221a\n[22]: \u03b7 = \u221a13 ( 2\u03b7q \u2212 \u03b7s ) = \u221a13 (u\u016b + dd \u0304 \u2212 ss\u0304) and \u03b7 \u2032 = \u221a13 (\u03b7q + 2\u03b7s ) = \u221a16 (u\u016b + dd \u0304 + 2ss\u0304).\n\n5\n\n\fwith pc being the center-of-mass momentum of either meson in the final state.

The fitted \u03c72 value is 0.29 per degree of freedom with quality 59.2% and 1.73\nper degree of freedom with quality 18.8% for the fits (7) and (8), respectively. Throughout this\npaper, we take \u03bb = 0.2253 \u00b1 0.0007, the weighted average of CKMfitter [25] and UTfit [26] groups,\nand neglect its small error. The relevant CKM matrix elements are Vud = Vcs = 1 \u2212 \u03bb2 /2 and\nVus = \u2212Vcd = \u03bb. With the inclusion of CKM factor Vcs\u2217 Vud in the amplitudes, our results in (8)\n\nagree with those in [18].

To obtain the 1-\u03c3 range\nof some parameter around its best-fitted value, we scan the parameter while allowing all the other\nparameters to vary at the same time to minimize the \u03c72 function. This renders a more conservative\nrange than the method that fixes all the other parameters to their best-fitted values when scanning\nthe parameter of interest, as used, for example, in Ref. [16].\nThe magnitudes of the updated T and C are larger than the 2008 ones due to the newly measured\nbranching fractions of K\u0304 0 \u03b7, \u03c0 + \u03b7 and \u03c0 + \u03b7 \u2032 modes being larger than the old ones. Notice that the\nW -annihilation amplitude A is substantially smaller than the W -exchange one E, and it is no\nlonger antiparallel to E, contrary to the previous claim [11, 15]. Indeed, A is almost perpendicular\nto E in fit (7) and its angle relative to E is close to 50\u25e6 in fit (8).\nA global fit to the data of singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay modes shows that the value of \u03c72\nis very large, of order 87 per degree of freedom. One solution we find is\n\u25e6\n\nC \u2032 = 2.36 ei222 ,\n\nT \u2032 = 1.14,\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nA\u2032 = 2.51 ei100 .\n\nE \u2032 = 1.85 e\u2212i52 ,\n\n(10)\n\nThis deviates substantially from the unprimed solution given in Eq. (7). The main processes\ncontributing to large \u03c72 are D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 (\u2206\u03c72 = 462), D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u2206\u03c72 = 248), D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0\n\n(\u2206\u03c72 = 119), and D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 (\u2206\u03c72 = 96).

Note\nthat there is a two-fold ambiguity in the relative strong phase, and we have picked the negative\none that is consistent with Eq. (7). These values agree with the unprimed values in Eq. (7) within\n1-\u03c3. If the data of D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is also included in the above fit, it will dominate the \u03c72 value which\nnow reads 19.6. A global fit to both CF and SCS modes yields \u03c72 = 52 per degree of freedom.\n\nAssuming that the primed amplitudes are identical to unprimed ones, i.e., T \u2032 = T, C \u2032 = C,\netc., the predicted branching fractions of SCS D \u2192 P P decays are shown in the last column of\n\nTable II.

The decay\nD 0 \u2192 K 0 K\u0304 0 is prohibited by SU(3) symmetry, but the measured rate is comparable to that of\nD 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . In the next section we shall study flavor SU(3) symmetry violation in SCS decays\nusing the factorization approach and investigate its possible connection to final-state interactions.\n\nSetting the double-primed topological amplitudes as unprimed ones, the branching fractions of\nDCS processes are displayed in Table III.\nA few remarks on our assumption of ignoring the SE and SA amplitudes are in place here.

Our results for R(D + ) and R(Ds+ ) differ in central values from those\n\nin [18] since the latter were obtained using the topological amplitudes extracted for \u03c6 = 43\u25e6 . The\n4\n\nThe formula R(D0 ) = 2 tan2 \u03b8C was originally derived under the phase convention such that KS =\n\u221a1 (K 0 \u2212 K\u0304 0 ) and KL = \u221a1 (K 0 + K\u0304 0 ) [28]. Of course, physics should be independent of the choice of\n2\n2\nphase convention. If we choose the convention CP |K 0 (~\np)i = |K\u0304 0 (\u2212~\np)i, we will have KS = \u221a12 (K 0 +\n1\n0\n0\n0\nK\u0304 ) and KL = \u221a2 (K \u2212 K\u0304 ) in the absence of CP violation. Since the axial vector current A\u03bc =\n \u0304 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )s under the CP transformation, it\ns\u0304\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )d transforms as CP (s\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )d)(CP )\u2020 = \u2212d\u03b3\n0\n0\nis clear that the decay constants of K and K\u0304 are opposite in sign. Consequently, A(D0 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 0 ) =\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2212(Vcd\nVus )/(Vcs\nVud )A(D0 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 0 ) = tan2 \u03b8C A(D0 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 0 ). It follows that D0 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 0 and D0 \u2192\nK 0 \u03c0 0 contribute constructively to D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 0 and destructively to D0 \u2192 KL \u03c0 0 .\n\n9\n\n\fCLEO measurements are [30]\nR(D 0 ) = 0.108 \u00b1 0.025 \u00b1 0.024,\n\nR(D + ) = 0.022 \u00b1 0.016 \u00b1 0.018.\n\n(14)\n\nEvidently, the calculated R(D 0 ) agrees well with experiment, while there is no evidence for a\nsignificant asymmetry in D + \u2192 KS,L \u03c0 + decays.\nC.\n\nD \u2192VP\n\nThe topological amplitude expressions for CF, SCS and DCS D \u2192 V P decays are listed in Tables\n\nIV to VI, respectively. For reduced amplitudes T and C in D \u2192 V P decays, the subscript P (V )\n\nimplies a pseudoscalar (vector) meson which contains the spectator quark of the charmed meson.\nFor E and A amplitudes with the final state q1 q\u03042 , the subscript P (V ) denotes a pseudoscalar\n(vector) meson which contains the antiquark q\u03042 .\nThe invariant amplitude is related to the partial width via\n\u0393(D \u2192 V P ) =\n\npc X\n|A|2\n8\u03c0m2D pol.\n\n(15)\n\nby summing over the the polarization states of the vector meson, or through the relation\n\u0393(D \u2192 V P ) =\n\np3c\n|\u00c3|2 ,\n2\n8\u03c0mD\n\n(16)\n\nby taking the polarization vector out of the amplitude, where A = (mV /mD )\u00c3 (\u03b5 * pD ). The first\napproach has been used in [36] for the extraction of topological amplitudes in B \u2192 V P decays,\nwhile the second approach was employed in [11, 12, 16] for D \u2192 V P . To illustrate the relations\n\nbetween Eqs. (15) and (16), we consider the channel Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c6 as an example. Its amplitude is\n\ngiven by A = Vcs\u2217 Vud TV with\n\ns\u03c6\nTV = 2f\u03c0 m\u03c6 AD\n(m2\u03c0 )(\u03b5 * pD ).\n0\n\n(17)\n\nevaluated in the factorization approach.

It is noted that\nthese results have no dependence on the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle. Solutions with a smaller CP , i.e. A'\nand S', are ruled out by the measurements of SCS decays D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c6 and D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c6 since they\n\n10\n\n\fTABLE IV: Branching fractions and invariant amplitudes for Cabibbo-favored decays of charmed\nmesons to one pseudoscalar and one vector meson.

be in\ncontradiction with the na\u0131\u0308ve expectation, we shall see in the next section that the corresponding\neffective parameter a1 is still larger than a2 , as anticipated from the short-distance approach.\nUsing the solutions of TV , CP and EP as inputs, the other amplitudes TP , CV and EV can\nbe obtained by considering the decay modes D 0 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c9, D 0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 \u03b7, D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c1+ , K\u0304 0 \u03c10 and\n\nD + \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c1+ . Here we have assumed that TP and TV are relatively real. We obtain 6 solutions\n\nA1\u2212A6 for topological amplitudes extracted from (16) and 5 solutions S1\u2212S5 when amplitudes\n\nare extracted from (15), as given in Table VIII.\nSeveral remarks are in order: (i) All the solutions are exact with \u03c72 = 0, except for S1 where\nthe fit \u03c72 value is 0.42. This is reflected in some of the predicted branching fractions in Table IV.\n(ii) Solutions displayed in Table VIII are obtained using the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle \u03c6 = 40.4\u25e6 . If the\n\nangle \u03c6 = 35.26\u25e6 is employed, we obtain\n(A1) TP = 7.85+0.54\n\u22122.27 ,\n\n+0.29\n(S1) TP = 3.12\u22120.39\n,\n\n+16 \u25e6\n\ni(172\u221214 )\n,\nCV = (3.63+0.71\n\u22121.21 ) e\n+13 \u25e6\n\ni(177\u221211 )\nCV = (1.25+0.32\n,\n\u22120.39 ) e\n\n+16 \u25e6\n\n\u2212i(110\u221223 )\n,\nEV = (2.51+1.19\n\u22121.18 )e\n+10 \u25e6\n\n\u2212i(107\u221211 )\nEV = (1.42+0.29\n.\n\u22120.34 )e\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the amplitudes in the A1 solution are quoted in units of 10\u22126 and those in the S1 solution\nin units of 10\u22126 (\u03b5 * pD ). By comparing them with solutions A1 and S1 in Table VIII, we see that a\nsmall decrease of the \u03b7\u2212\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle will reduce TP and CV slightly and enhance the magnitude\n\n13\n\n\fTABLE VII: Solutions for TV , CP and EP .

(iii) Using \u03c6 = 35.26\u25e6 and removing the CKM angles Vcd\nud from the amplitudes, we are\n\nable to reproduce solutions A1\u2212A6 in Table III of [16].\n\n6\n\n(iv) The relation EV = \u2212EP used in\n\n[12] is not borne out in this analysis. Instead, the angle between EV and EP turns out to be\nsmall. (v) To see the relative phase \u03b4TV TP between TP and TV , we fit to the data of the CF D 0 ,\nD + decays and the channel Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c6 and find that \u03b4TV TP is of order (16 \u223c 18)\u25e6 when using\nEq. (15) and (\u22121 \u223c 1)\u25e6 when using Eq. (16). Therefore, the assumption of relatively real TP and\n\nTV amplitudes is justified. (vi) A careful comparison between the two sets of solutions (A1\u2212A6 and\nS1\u2212S5) in Table VIII shows that there is no solution in the latter set that corresponds to solution\n\nA2. Ref. [16] claims that solution A2 is an alternative solution to A1 as it produces roughly the\nsame \u03c72 as A1 when they are applied to the SCS decays. However, we find that the D 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7\nmode alone contributes \u2206\u03c72 = 285 in solution A2, sufficient to disregard this solution.\n6\n\nIt seems to us that there is a sign typo in solution A6 of [16]: The amplitude TP there should be negative.\n\n14\n\n\fNow we come to the remaining parameters AP and AV appearing in the CF Ds+ decays. The\nnon-observation of the decays Ds+ \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c0 + and \u03c1+ \u03c0 0 gives a strong constraint on the W -annihilation\n\namplitudes. The mode Ds+ \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c0 + was quoted by the Particle Data Group as \"not seen\" [31].\nWhile the ratio \u0393(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c0 + )/\u0393(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) was measured by E791 to be (5.8 \u00b1 2.3 \u00b1 3.7)%\n\n[40], a most recent Dalitz plot analysis of Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 by BaBar yielded the fit fraction\n(1.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 1.0)% [41]. This mode was also not seen by the FOCUS Collaboration [42]. Given\n\nthe branching fraction B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (1.11 \u00b1 0.08)% [31], the BaBar result leads to the\n\nupper limit B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c0 + ) < 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 . If we ignore the decays Ds+ \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c0 + and \u03c1+ \u03c0 0 for\n\nthe moment, the annihilation amplitudes AP and AV can be determined from the four channels\n\nK\u0304 \u22170 K + , K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ , \u03c1+ \u03b7 and \u03c0 + \u03c9 in conjunction with the information of CP from solution A or S\nand TP , CV from solution A1 or S1. It turns out that although the above four Ds+ modes are\nnicely fitted, the predicted B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c0 + ) of order 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 is too large.\n\n7\n\nFrom the measured rates of Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c10 and Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 we have\n|AV \u2212 AP | < 0.20 \u00d7 10\u22126 (\u03b5 * pD ),\n\n|AV + AP | = (0.41 \u00b1 0.09) \u00d7 10\u22126 (\u03b5 * pD )\n\n(20)\n\n|AV + AP | = (1.04 \u00b1 0.22) \u00d7 10\u22126\n\n(21)\n\nobtained using Eq. (15) and\n|AV \u2212 AP | < 0.50 \u00d7 10\u22126 ,\n\nusing Eq. (16). Hence, the magnitudes of AP and AV are much smaller than that of CP and CV .\nIn principle, the annihilation amplitudes can be determined when the above equation is combined\nwith the amplitudes of Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K + and K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ . However since |CP | > |CV | \u226b |AP |, |AV |, it\nis not possible to have a nice fit to the data of K\u0304 \u22170 K + , K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ , \u03c0 + \u03c9 and \u03c0 + \u03c10 simultaneously.\n\nTo see this, we set AV \u2248 AP as a consequence of the non-observation of Ds+ \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c0 + . Under this\n\nrelation, it is naively expected that Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ has a rate larger than Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K + since\n|CP | > |CV |. Experimentally, it is the other way around: B(Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K + ) = (3.97 \u00b1 0.21)%\n\nand B(Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ ) = (5.3 \u00b1 1.2)%. Since the former has been measured several times in the\n\npast decade (see Particle Data Group [31] and the latest one [32]) while the latter was measured\ntwo decades ago [43], it is likely that the quoted experimental result for Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ was\n\noverestimated. In short, a sensible determination of AP and AV cannot be made at present and\n\nwe have to await more accurate measurement of Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ .\n\nThe cited experimental result for Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 is also problematic. Since |TP | \u226b |AV + AP |, we\n\ncan neglect the annihilation contributions for the moment. It follows that if we use the solution with\nthe largest TP , the predicted branching ratios will be B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7) = (7.4 \u00b1 0.7)% [(7.1 \u00b1 1.8)%]\n7\n\nIn Ref. [16], the amplitudes AV and AP were determined from Ds+ \u2192 (K\u0304 \u22170 K + , K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ , \u03c0 + \u03c9). It is\nnot clear to us how the four unknown parameters (two magnitudes and two phases) can be extracted\nout of three data points. Anyway, solutions A1 and A2 given in Table IV of [16] for AP and AV lead\nto B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c0 + ) \u223c 1.2% and 2.2% in their central values, respectively, which are obviously too large\ncompared to experiment.\n\n15\n\n\fand B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 ) = (2.7 \u00b1 0.2)% [(2.6 \u00b1 0.7)%)] for solution A1 [S1]. While the predicted rate for\nthe former is close to the recent CLEO measurement B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7) = (8.9 \u00b1 0.8)%, the latter is far\n\nbelow the quoted result B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 ) = (12.2 \u00b1 2.0)%. It is very unlikely that the flavor-singlet\n\ncontribution unique to the \u03b70 production can enhance its branching fraction from 3% to 12%. This\nissue should be clarified by new measurement of Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 .\n\nAmong the solutions A1\u2212A6 and S1\u2212S5, A1 and S1 are our preferred solutions for the following\n\ntwo reasons: (i) A global fit to the SCS decays of the D 0 meson (data of D + and Ds+ are not included\nin the fit due to the lack of information on AP and AV ) indicates that A1 and S1 have the lowest\nvalues of \u03c72 , 89 and 165, respectively, and (ii) TP has to be sufficiently large in order to possibly\naccommodate the data of Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7.\nIII.\nA.\n\nPHENOMENOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS\nParameters a1 and a2\n\nIn the diagrammatic approach, the topological amplitudes extracted using the \u03c72 fit method\nare not unique. Indeed, several other solutions are also allowed. It is useful to consider the\namplitudes for color-allowed and color-suppressed diagrams in the factorization approach in order\nto discriminate between different solutions. For CF D \u2192 K\u0304\u03c0, K\u0304 \u2217 \u03c0, K\u0304\u03c1 decays, the factorizable\namplitudes read\n\nGF\nT = \u221a a1 (K\u03c0) f\u03c0 (m2D \u2212 m2K )F0DK (m2\u03c0 ),\n2\nGF\nC = \u221a a2 (K\u03c0) fK (m2D \u2212 m2\u03c0 )F0D\u03c0 (m2K ),\n2\nGF\n\u2217\n\u2217\nTV = \u221a a1 (K \u03c0) 2f\u03c0 mK \u2217 ADK\n(m2\u03c0 )(\u03b5 * pD ),\n0\n2\nGF\n\u2217\n(22)\nCP = \u221a a2 (K \u03c0) 2fK \u2217 mK \u2217 F1D\u03c0 (m2K \u2217 )(\u03b5 * pD ),\n2\nGF\nTP = \u221a a1 (K\u03c1) 2f\u03c1 m\u03c1 F1DK (m2\u03c1 )(\u03b5 * pD ),\n2\nGF\n2\nCV = \u221a a2 (K\u03c1) 2fK m\u03c1 AD\u03c1\n0 (mK )(\u03b5 * pD ),\n2\nwhere we have followed [44] for the definition of form factors. Factorization implies a universal,\n\u2217\n\nprocess-independent a1 and a2 , for example, a2 (K\u03c1) = a2 (K \u03c0) = a2 (K\u03c0).\nUnder the na\u0131\u0308ve factorization hypothesis, one has\n1\n1\nc2 (\u03bc),\na2 (\u03bc) = c2 (\u03bc) +\nc1 (\u03bc),\n(23)\na1 (\u03bc) = c1 (\u03bc) +\nNc\nNc\nfor decay amplitudes induced by current-current operators O1,2 (\u03bc), where c1,2 (\u03bc) are the corresponding Wilson coefficients and Nc is the number of colors. However, it is well known that this\nnaive factorization approach encounters two difficulties: (i) the coefficients ai given by Eq. (23) are\nrenormalization scale and \u03b35 -scheme dependent, and (ii) it fails to describe the color-suppressed\n\n16\n\n\fTABLE IX: Form factors at q 2 = 0 and the shape parameter \u03b1.\nF (0)\n\u03b1\n\nF1DK\n0.739\n0.33\n\nF1D\u03c0\n0.666\n0.24\n\nF0DK\n0.739\n0.30\n\nF0D\u03c0\n0.666\n0.21\n\nAD\u03c1\n0\n0.74\n0.36\n\n\u2217\n\nADK\n0\n0.78\n0.24\n\ndecay modes due to the smallness of a2 . In particular, the ratio of D 0 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 0 to D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + is\n\npredicted to be of order 10\u22122 , while experimentally it is close to 1/2. Therefore, it is necessary to\ntake into account nonfactorizable corrections:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n+ \u03c71 (\u03bc) ,\na2 = c2 (\u03bc) + c1 (\u03bc)\n+ \u03c72 (\u03bc) ,\n(24)\na1 = c1 (\u03bc) + c2 (\u03bc)\nNc\nNc\nwhere nonfactorizable terms are characterized by the parameters \u03c7i , which receive corrections\nincluding vertex corrections, hard spectator interactions involving the spectator quark of the heavy\nmeson, and FSI effects from inelastic rescattering, resonance effects, etc. The nonfactorizable terms\n\u03c7i (\u03bc) will compensate the scale and scheme dependence of Wilson coefficients to render ai physical.\nIn the so-called large-Nc approach, a rule of discarding subleading 1/Nc terms is formulated [2].\nThis amounts to having a universal nonfactorizable term \u03c71 = \u03c72 = \u22121/Nc in Eq. (24) and hence\na1 \u2248 c1 (m\u0304c ) = 1.274 ,\n\na2 \u2248 c2 (m\u0304c ) = \u22120.529\n\n(25)\n\nfor \u039bMS = 215 MeV and m\u0304c (mc ) = 1.3 GeV [45]. This corresponds to a relative strong phase of\n180\u25e6 . Empirically, this set of a1 and a2 gives a good description of the hadronic charm decays.\nHence, a1 and a2 in the large-Nc approach can be considered as the theoretical benchmark values.\nFrom the topological amplitudes obtained in Sec. II, we are ready to determine the effective\nWilson coefficients a1 and a2 and their ratios. For the invariant amplitudes of D \u2192 V P determined\nfrom Eq. (15), a1,2 are extracted using the factorizable amplitudes given in Eq. (22). However, if\n\nthe topological amplitudes of D \u2192 V P are extracted from Eq. (16), we should use the following\nfactorizable amplitudes\n\nGF\n\u2217\n\u2217\nT\u0303V = \u221a a1 (K \u03c0) 2f\u03c0 mD ADK\n(m2\u03c0 ),\n0\n2\nGF\n\u2217\nC\u0303P = \u221a a2 (K \u03c0) 2fK \u2217 mD F1D\u03c0 (m2K \u2217 ),\n2\nGF\nT\u0303P = \u221a a1 (K\u03c1) 2f\u03c1 mD F1DK (m2\u03c1 ),\n2\nGF\n2\nC\u0303V = \u221a a2 (K\u03c1) 2fK mD AD\u03c1\n0 (mK )\n2\n\n(26)\n\nto determine a1,2 . As noted in passing, the amplitudes \u00c3 and A are related by Eq. (18).\n\nIn order to extract the parameters a1,2 we need to know the form factors and their q 2 dependence.\n\nThere exist many model and lattice calculations for D to \u03c0, K transition form factors. In this work\nwe shall use the following parametrization for form-factor q 2 dependence [46]\nF (q 2 ) =\n\n(1\n\nF (0)\n\u2212 \u03b1q 2 /m2\u2217 )\n\n\u2212 q 2 /m2\u2217 )(1\n\n17\n\n(27)\n\n\fTABLE X: The extracted parameters a1 and a2 .\nD \u2192 K\u03c0\n|a1 |\n|a2 |\n|a2 /a1 |\nArg(a2 /a1 )\n\n1.22 \u00b1 0.02\n0.82 \u00b1 0.02\n0.67 \u00b1 0.02\n\u2212(152 \u00b1 1)\u25e6\n\n\u2217\n\nD\u2192K \u03c0\n\nA\n1.32 \u00b1 0.05\n0.87 \u00b1 0.05\n0.66 \u00b1 0.05\n\u2212(162 \u00b1 3)\u25e6\n\nS\n1.43 \u00b1 0.06\n0.95 \u00b1 0.05\n0.67 \u00b1 0.05\n\u2212(164 \u00b1 3)\u25e6\n\nD \u2192 K\u03c1\n\nA1\n1.38 \u00b1 0.06\n1.06 \u00b1 0.12\n0.77 \u00b1 0.09\n(164 \u00b1 23)\u25e6\n\nS1\n1.29 \u00b1 0.17\n0.82 \u00b1 0.27\n0.63 \u00b1 0.22\n(177 \u00b1 15)\u25e6\n\u2217\n\nDK , ADK ,\nwith m\u2217 being a pole mass. Specifically, m\u2217 = mDs\u2217 , mDs , mD\u2217 , mD for form factors F1,0\n0\n\nD\u03c0 and AD\u03c1 , respectively. The inputs for the parameters F (0) and \u03b1 are summarized in Table\nF1,0\n0\n\nIX. Form factors for D to \u03c0 and K transitions are taken from the recent CLEO-c measurements\nof D meson semileptonic decays to \u03c0 and K mesons [47], while D \u2192 \u03c1, K \u2217 transition form factors\n\nfrom [46] with some modification. For decay constants we use f\u03c0 = 130.4 MeV, fK = 155.5 MeV\n[31], f\u03c1 = 216 MeV and fK \u2217 = 220 MeV [48].\nThe extracted parameters a1,2 are shown in Table X, where we have used solutions A and S\nfor the topological amplitudes TP , CV and T\u0303P , C\u0303V , respectively, and the preferred solution A1 for\nTV , CP and S1 for T\u0303V , C\u0303P . Due to final-state interactions, the magnitude of a2 is substantially\nlarger than the benchmark value 0.529 , while the magnitude of a1 is of order 1.3 \u223c 1.4 for D \u2192 K\u0304 \u2217 \u03c0\nand D \u2192 K\u0304\u03c1 decays.\n\nAs noticed in passing, solutions of CP with magnitude smaller than TV (solutions A' and S'\n\nin Table VII) are ruled out since the predicted rates for SCS decays D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c6 and D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c6\n\nare too small compared to experiments. This can also be seen from the extracted ratio |a2 /a1 |\n\nwhich is expected to be similar for all two-body hadronic D decays. For solutions A' and S' with\nsmaller CP , the ratio |a2 /a1 | is 0.38 and deviates substantially from the value of 0.68 obtained\n\nfrom D \u2192 K\u0304\u03c0 decays. Notice that although |CP | > |TV |, the extracted parameters look normal,\n\nnamely, |a1 | > |a2 |. Among solutions A1\u2212A6 and S1\u2212S5, it is natural to select solutions A1 and\n\nS1 since the magnitude of their a2 and the ratio |a2 /a1 | are closer to those in solutions A and S\n(see Table X). As stressed before, a large TP is definitely needed in order to accommodate the\n\ndata of Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7.\nB.\n\nSU(3) breaking and final-state interactions\n\nAs discussed before, based on the exact flavor SU(3) symmetry and our best solutions to the\ntopological amplitudes extracted from CF charm decays, the predicted branching fractions of SCS\nD decays are too large for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and too small for K + K \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03b7 and \u03c0 + \u03b7 \u2032 . In the following,\nwe shall first examine SU(3) breaking effects in color-allowed and color-suppressed tree amplitudes\nwithin the factorization approach (for an earlier study of SU(3) violation in charm decays, see\n[49]). It turns out that while part of the SU(3) breaking effects can be accounted for by SU(3)\n\n18\n\n\fsymmetry violation manifested in T and C amplitudes, in some cases such as the ratio R = \u0393(D 0 \u2192\nK + K \u2212 )/\u0393(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), SU(3) breaking alone in spectator amplitudes does not suffice to account\n\nfor R. This calls for the consideration of SU(3) violation in the W -exchange amplitudes.\n\n1.\n\nSU(3) breaking\n\nTo illustration the effect of SU(3) symmetry violation in external and internal W -emission\namplitudes, we consider the following modes: D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 + \u03b7, \u03c0 + \u03b7 \u2032 and D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nD+ \u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c00\n\nSince the isospin of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 state is I = 2, this channel does not have nontrivial final-state\n\ninteractions. Indeed, it does not receive weak annihilation contributions. This means that the\nshort-distance approach should suffice to describe this decay. The factorizable amplitudes read\nGF\n\u2032\nT\u03c0\u03c0\n= \u221a a1 f\u03c0 (m2D \u2212 m2\u03c0 )F0D\u03c0 (m2\u03c0 ),\n2\nG\nF\n\u2032\nC\u03c0\u03c0\n= \u221a a2 f\u03c0 (m2D \u2212 m2\u03c0 )F0D\u03c0 (m2\u03c0 ).\n2\n\n(28)\n\nHence,\n\u2032\nm2 \u2212 m2\u03c0 F0D\u03c0 (m2\u03c0 )\nT\u03c0\u03c0\n= 2D\n,\nT\nmD \u2212 m2K F0DK (m2\u03c0 )\n\n\u2032\nf\u03c0 F0D\u03c0 (m2\u03c0 )\nC\u03c0\u03c0\n=\n,\nC\nfK F0D\u03c0 (m2K )\n\n(29)\n\n\u2032 /T = 0.96 and C \u2032 /C = 0.78.\nwhere use of Eq.

Hence the discrepancy between theory and experiment is\n\nsubstantially improved. Presumably, a better agreement will be achieved if SU(3) violation in\nthe W -annihilation amplitude is included. For example, if A\u2032 = 0.7A is taken, we will have\nB(D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7) = (3.02 \u00b1 0.19) \u00d7 10\u22123 and B(D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 \u2032 ) = (4.69 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10\u22123 , bringing our\npredictions closer to the observed data.\nD0 \u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 , K + K \u2212\n\nExperimentally, the rate of D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 is larger than that of D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 by a factor of\n\n2.8, while they should be the same in the SU(3) limit. This is a long-standing puzzle since SU(3)\nsymmetry is expected to be broken at the level of 30%. Without the inclusion of SU(3) breaking\neffects in the topological amplitudes, we see from Table II that the predicted rate of K + K \u2212 is even\nsmaller than that of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 due to less phase space available to the former. In the factorization\napproach we have\n\u2032\nTKK\nfK m2D \u2212 m2K F0DK (m2K )\n.\n=\n\u2032\nT\u03c0\u03c0\nf\u03c0 m2D \u2212 m2\u03c0 F0D\u03c0 (m2\u03c0 )\n\n(35)\n\nUsing the form factor parametrization given by Eqs. (27) and input parameters given in Table IX,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 = E, we obtain T \u2032\nand assuming no SU(3) symmetry breaking in E so that EKK\n= E\u03c0\u03c0\nKK /T\u03c0\u03c0 =\n\n1.32, implying that B(D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 ) = (3.4 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u22123 and B(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (2.1 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u22123 .\n\nTherefore, SU(3) symmetry breaking alone in T \u2032 is not adequate to resolve the puzzle. This calls\n\nfor the consideration of SU(3) flavor symmetry violation in the W -exchange amplitudes. We will\ncome back to this issue in the next subsection.\n\n2.\n\nFinal-state interactions\n\nWe learn from the above few examples that when SU(3) breaking effects in color-allowed and\ncolor-suppressed amplitudes are included, the discrepancy between theory and experiment for SCS\n\n20\n\n\f\u03c0+\n\nu\nc\n\nd\n\u03c0\n\ns d\n\nu\n\n0\n\nd\n\nc\nK\n\nD0\nu\n\nK\u2212\n\nd\n\n0\n\ns\n\n\u03c0+\n\nd\nK\n\nu\n\nu\n\ns\n\n\u03c00\n\nD0\n\ns\n\nu\n\n(a)\n\nK\u2212\n\n0\n\nu\n\n(b)\n0\n\nFIG. 1: Contributions to D 0 \u2192 K \u03c0 0 from the color-allowed weak decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + followed by\n\na resonant-like rescattering (a) and quark exchange (b). While (a) has the same topology as the\nW -exchange graph, (b) mimics the color-suppressed internal W -emission graph.\n\ndecays will be significantly reduced. However, in order to get a better agreement, violation of SU(3)\nsymmetry in weak annihilation (W -exchange and W -annihilation) must be taken into account.\nThis is particularly true for the ratio R = \u0393(D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 )/\u0393(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ); SU(3) violation in\nspectator amplitudes accounts for only half of the ratio R.\n\nUnder the factorization hypothesis, the factorizable W -exchange and W -annihilation amplitudes are proportional to a2 and a1 , respectively.\n\n8\n\nThey are suppressed due to the smallness of\n\nthe form factor at large q 2 = m2D . This corresponds to the so-called helicity suppression. At first\nglance, it appears that the factorizable weak annihilation amplitudes are too small to be consistent\nwith experiment at all. However, in the diagrammatic approach here, the topological amplitudes\nC, E, A can receive contributions from the tree amplitude T via final-state rescattering, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for D 0 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 0 : Fig. 1(a) has the same topology as the W -exchange diagram E,\n\nwhile 1(b) mimics the internal W -emission amplitude C. Therefore, even if the short-distance W exchange vanishes, a long-distance W -exchange can be induced via inelastic FSIs. Historically, it\nwas first pointed out in [52] that rescattering effects required by unitarity can produce the reaction\n0\n\nD 0 \u2192 K \u03c6, for example, even in the absence of the W -exchange diagram. Then it was realized\n\nthat this rescattering diagram belongs to the generic W -exchange topology [7].\n\nThere are several different forms of FSIs: elastic scattering and inelastic scattering such as\nquark exchange, resonance formation, etc. For charm decays, it is expected that the long-distance\nweak annihilation is dominated by resonant FSIs. That is, the resonance formation of FSI via\nq q\u0304 resonances is usually the most important one due to the fact that an abundant spectrum of\nresonances is known to exist at energies close to the mass of the charmed meson. Indeed, the\nsizable magnitude of E and its large phase determined from experiment are suggestive of nearby\n8\n\nIn the QCD factorization (QCDF) approach [50], E and A are proportional to the Wilson coefficients c1\nand c2 , respectively, and hence A = (c2 /c1 )E [29, 51]. However, the charm quark is not heavy enough to\njustify the use of QCDF in charm decays.\n\n21\n\n\fresonance effects. (As noted in [53], weak annihilation in V P systems receives little contributions\nfrom resonant FSIs. We shall show below that the W -annihilation amplitude in Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 arises\n\nfrom final-state rescattering via quark exchange.) A direct calculation of the resonant FSI diagram\n\nis subject to many theoretical uncertainties. Nevertheless, as emphasized in [54, 55], most of the\nproperties of resonances follow from unitarity alone, without regard to the dynamical mechanism\nthat produces the resonance. Consequently, as shown in [53, 54], the effect of resonance-induced\nFSIs can be described in a model-independent manner in terms of the mass and width of the nearby\nresonances. It was found that weak annihilation amplitudes are modified by resonant FSIs as (see\ne.g., [53])\n\u0012\n\nE = e + (e2i\u03b4r \u2212 1) e +\n\nT\n3\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nA = a + (e2i\u03b4r \u2212 1) a +\n\n,\n\nC\n3\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(36)\n\nwith\ne2i\u03b4r = 1 \u2212 i\n\n\u0393\n,\nmD \u2212 mR + i\u0393/2\n\n(37)\n\nwhere the W -exchange amplitude E and W -annihilation A before resonant FSIs are denoted by\ne and a, respectively. Therefore, resonance-induced FSIs amount to modifying the W -exchange\namplitude and leaving the other quark-diagram amplitudes T and C intact. We thus see that even if\nthe short-distance weak annihilation vanishes (i.e. e = 0 and a = 0), as commonly asserted, a longdistance W -exchange (W -annihilation) contribution still can be induced from the tree amplitude\nT (C) via FSI rescattering in resonance formation.\nD 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K + K \u2212 revisited\n\nWe have discussed before that resonant FSIs usually give the most important contributions\n\nto the weak annihilation topology in the P P modes. For \u2206S = 1 D \u2192 K\u0304\u03c0 decays, there is a\nJ P = 0+ resonance K \u2217 (1950) in the sd \u0304 quark content with a mass 1945 \u00b1 10 \u00b1 20 MeV and a width\n0\n\n201 \u00b1 34 \u00b1 79 MeV [31].\n\n9\n\nAssuming e = 0 in Eq. (36), we obtain\nE = 1.68 \u00d7 10\u22126 exp(i143\u25e6 ) GeV,\n\n(38)\n\n\u22126 exp[i(122\u00b11)\u25e6 ] GeV. Presumably,\nwhich is close to the \"experimental\" value E = (1.53+0.05\n\u22120.06 )\u00d710\n\na non-vanishing short-distance e will render the phase of E in agreement with experiment. For\n\n\u2206S = 0 D \u2192 P P decays, there is a nearby scalar resonance f0 (1710) which decays to K K\u0304 and \u03c0\u03c0\u0304,\nas depicted in Fig. 2. This long-distance contribution has the same topology as the W -exchange\ndiagram.\nRecent lattice and phenomenological studies indicate that f0 (1710) is dominated by the scalar\nglueball component [57, 58]. If f0 (1710) is primarily a scalar glueball G, it is na\u0131\u0308vely expected that\n\u0393(G \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u0304)/\u0393(G \u2192 K K\u0304) \u2248 0.9 after phase space correction due to the flavor independent coupling\n\nof G to P P . However, experimentally there is a relatively large suppression of \u03c0\u03c0\u0304 production\n9\n\nThe importance of the K0\u2217 (1950) contribution to D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + has been emphasized in [56].\n\n22\n\n\fK, \u03c0\nD0\n\nf0(1710)\n\nK\u0304, \u03c0\u0304\n\nFIG. 2: Long-distance resonant contribution to the color-suppressed tree amplitude of D 0 \u2192\n\nK K\u0304, \u03c0\u03c0\u0304 through the intermediate state f0 (1710), where the blob stands for a transition due to\nweak interactions. This has the same topology as the W -exchange topological diagram.\n\nrelative to K K\u0304 in f0 (1710) decays. The ratio \u0393(f0 (1710) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u0304)/\u0393(f0 (1710) \u2192 K K\u0304) is measured\n\n+ \u2212 + \u2212\nto be 0.41+0.11\n\u22120.17 by BES from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3(K K , \u03c0 \u03c0 ) decays [59]. To explain the large disparity\n\nbetween \u03c0\u03c0\u0304 and K K\u0304 production in scalar glueball decays, it was first noticed by Carlson et al.\n[60], by Cornwall and Soni [61] and vitalized recently by Chanowitz [62] that a pure scalar glueball\n\ncannot decay into a quark-antiquark pair in the chiral limit, i.e., A(G \u2192 q q\u0304) \u221d mq . Since the\n\ncurrent strange quark mass is an order of magnitude larger than mu and md , decay to K K\u0304 is\n\nlargely favored over \u03c0\u03c0\u0304. However, chiral suppression for the ratio \u0393(G \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u0304)/\u0393(G \u2192 K K\u0304) at the\nhadron level should not be so strong as the current quark mass ratio mu /ms . It has been suggested\n\n[63] that mq should be interpreted as the scale of chiral symmetry breaking since chiral symmetry\nis broken not only by finite quark masses but is also broken spontaneously.\nIn short, if the glueball component of f0 (1710) is dominant, then this will explain qualitatively\nwhy the D 0 meson decays to K + K \u2212 more copiously then \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 through the resonant FSIs.\nD 0 \u2192 K 0 K\u0304 0\n\nIt is known that the decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 K\u0304 0 proceeds only through the W -exchange mechanism\n\nand vanishes under SU(3). Since the short-distance W -exchange is expected to be small and\nfurthermore subject to SU(3) cancellation, this mode can only occur through long-distance W exchange induced by final-state rescattering [64]. The nearby pole contribution from f0 (1710) will\ncontribute to the decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 K\u0304 0 . However, in contrast to D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , this channel is\nprohibited under exact SU(3) symmetry. To see this, Fig. 3 shows some possible weak transition\nbetween D 0 and f0 (1710). It is clear that for K 0 K\u0304 0 production, both s and d quarks get involved\nand compensate each other in SU(3) limit due to the cancellation of CKM matrix elements, while\nonly the s quark gets involved in K + K \u2212 production. It has been shown in [58] that in the limit of\nSU(3) symmetry, f0 (1710) is composed of a scalar gluonium and a small amount of SU(3) singlet.\nConsequently, the D 0\u2212f0 (1710) weak transition for K 0 K\u0304 0 production indeed vanishes when SU(3)\n\nflavor symmetry is exact.\n\n23\n\n\fs, d\n\nc\n\ns, d\nu\nc\n\nu\n\ns, d\n\ns, d\n\nu\n\nD0\ns, d\n\nu\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFIG. 3: Possible D 0 \u2212 f0 (1710) transition from (a) intermediate states such as K + K \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 etc.,\n\nand (b) W -exchange.\n\nC.\n\nAnnihilation amplitudes AP and AV from final-state rescattering\n\nAs discussed before, we have some difficulties in extracting and understanding the W annihilation amplitudes AP and AV in D \u2192 V P decays. The topological amplitude expressions of\nDs+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c10 and Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 are given by\n\n1\nA(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c10 ) = \u221a Vcs\u2217 Vud (AV \u2212 AP ),\n2\n1 \u2217\n+\n+\nA(Ds \u2192 \u03c0 \u03c9) = \u221a Vcs Vud (AV + AP ).\n2\n\n(39)\n\nNa\u0131\u0308vely it is expected that AP = \u2212AV . The argument goes as follows. The direct W -annihilation\n \u0304 has\ncontributions via cs\u0304 \u2192 W \u2192 ud \u0304 are not allowed in D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9, \u03c1+ \u03b7, \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 decays since the (ud)\ns\n\n \u0304 =\u2212\nzero total angular momentum and hence it has the quantum number of \u03c0 + . Therefore, G(ud)\nand the final states should have an odd G-parity. Since the G-parity is even for \u03c9\u03c0 + and odd\n\nfor \u03c0 + \u03c10 , it follows that the former does not receive any direct W -exchange contribution. Can\none induce Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 from resonant FSIs? The answer is no because the J = 0, I = 1 meson\nresonance made from a quark-antiquark pair ud \u0304 has an odd G parity. As stressed in [65], the\neven-G state \u03c0 + \u03c9 (also \u03c1\u03b7 and \u03c1\u03b7 \u2032 ) does not couple to any single meson resonances, nor to the\nstate produced by the W -annihilation diagram with no gluons emitted by the initial state before\nannihilation. Indeed, a general consideration of resonant FSIs gives the relations [53, 54]\nArP + ArV = aP + aV ,\n1\nArP \u2212 ArV = aP \u2212 aV + (e2i\u03b4r \u2212 1) aP \u2212 aV + (CP \u2212 CV ) ,\n3\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(40)\n\nwith the superscript r denoting the annihilation amplitude arising from resonant FSIs. The above\nrelation shows that AP + AV does not receive any q\u0304q \u2032 resonance (e.g., the 0\u2212 resonance \u03c0(1800))\ncontributions. Since the above G-parity argument implies aV = \u2212aP , the decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 is\n\nforbidden, whereas Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c10 receives both factorizable and resonance-induced W -annihilation\n\ncontributions. Experimentally, however, it is the other way around: B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9) = (2.1 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7\n10\u22123 , while B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c10 ) is not seen.\n\n24\n\n\fu\nc\n\ns\n\n\u03c1+\n\nd\n\n\u03c9\nc\n\nu\n\n\u03c0+\n\ns\n\nu\n\u03c0+\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nDs+\n\nu\n\n\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032\n\n\u03c1+\n\nu\n\nd\n\nDs+\ns\n\nu\n\ns\n\n\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032\n\n\u03c9\nd\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n\u2032\n\nFIG. 4: Long-distance contributions to Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 from the weak decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 ( ) followed by\n\nquark exchange.

Owing to\n\u2032\n\nG-parity conservation, \u03c1+ \u03b7 ( ) cannot rescatter into \u03c0 + \u03c10 .\n\nTo resolve the above-mentioned puzzle, we note that there are long-distance final-state rescattering contributions to Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 allowed by G-parity conservation. A nice example is the\n\u2032\n\ncontribution from the weak decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 ( ) followed by quark exchange (Fig. 4).\nrescattering of\n\n\u2032\n\u03c1+ \u03b7 ( )\n\ninto\n\n\u03c0 + \u03c10\n\nis prohibited by the G-parity selection rule.\n\nThe\n\nConsequently,\n\nAP + AV = AeP + AeV = 2ArP , where the superscript e indicates final-state rescattering via quark\nexchange, and AP \u2212 AV = ArP \u2212 ArV . Since Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 has the largest rate among the CF\nDs+ \u2192 V P decays,\n\n10\n\nit is conceivable that Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 can be produced via FSIs at the 10\u22123 level\n\nas its branching fraction. Other processes such as the weak decays Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 (\u2217)0 K (\u2217)+ followed\n\nby K\u0304 (\u2217)0 K (\u2217)+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 have been discussed in [66, 67]. However, this rescattering process does\n\nnot involve quark exchange. This decay may also proceed through pre-radiation of the \u03c9. For\ninstance, the Ds+ meson can dissociate into two meson states such as D (\u2217)0 K (\u2217)+ and D (\u2217)+ K (\u2217)0\nwhich rescatter strongly to (cs\u0304)\u03c9 while the virtual cs\u0304 state decays weakly to \u03c0 + [68].\n\nAs pointed out in [69], the \u03c9 meson can be produced from the decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c6 followed by\n\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c6 mixing. This will be possible if \u03c6 is not a pure ss\u0304 state and contains a tiny q q\u0304 component.\n\nNeglecting isospin violation and the admixture with the \u03c10 meson, one can parametrize the \u03c9\u2013\u03c6\nmixing in terms of an angle \u03b4 such that the physical \u03c9 and \u03c6 are related to the ideally mixed states\n\u221a\n \u0304\n\u03c9 I \u2261 (u\u016b + dd)/\n2 and \u03c6I \u2261 ss\u0304 by\n\u03c9\n\u03c6\n\n!\n\n=\n\ncos \u03b4 sin \u03b4\n\u2212 sin \u03b4 cos \u03b4\n\n!\n\n\u03c9I\n\u03c6I\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(41)\n\nand the mixing angle is about |\u03b4| \u223c 3.3\u25e6 [70] (see [21] for the latest determination of \u03b4).

Hence, it is not the dominant mechanism for the\nDs+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 decay.\n\nSince FSIs are nonperturbative in nature, in principle it is extremely difficult to calculate their\n\neffects. It is customary to evaluate the final-state rescattering contribution, Fig. 4, at the hadron\nlevel manifested in Fig. 5. One of the diagrams, namely, Fig. 5(b), has been evaluated in [67]. As\nstressed in [71], the calculation of the meson-level Feynman diagrams such as Fig. 5 involves many\ntheoretical uncertainties. If one na\u0131\u0308vely calculates the diagram, one will obtain an answer which\ndoes not make sense in the context of perturbation theory since the contributions become so large\nthat perturbation is no longer trustworthy. Moreover, because the t-channel exchanged particle is\nnot on-shell, a form-factor cutoff must be introduced to the vertex to render the whole calculation\nmeaningful. We will leave the calculation of Fig. 5 to a separate publication.\n+\nFinally, we would like to point out that the study of the decays Ds+ \u2192 (\u03c1+ , a+\n1 , a0 )\u03c9 will\n\nhelp understand the annihilation mechanisms in Ds+ decays. Unlike the \u03c0 + \u03c9 mode, Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c9\n\ncan be induced by resonant FSIs and hence it is anticipated to have a larger rate. The recent\nCLEO measurements of Ds+ exclusive decays involving an \u03c9 show that the branching fractions of\n\nDs+ \u2192 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03b7)\u03c9 are (2.78 \u00b1 0.70)%, (1.58 \u00b1 0.46)% and (0.85 \u00b1 0.54)%, respectively\n\n+\n[72]. Assuming the validity of the narrow width approximation, B(a+\n0 (980) \u2192 \u03c0 \u03b7) = 1 and\n\n+\n+\n+\n+ + \u2212\nB(a+\n1 (1260) \u2192 (3\u03c0) ) = 100% in conjunction with the assumption of B(a1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0 ) = B(a1 \u2192\n+\n+\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ), the branching fractions of Ds+ \u2192 a+\n0 (980)\u03c9 and Ds \u2192 a1 (1260)\u03c9 are ready to obtain.\n\nD.\n\nComments on D \u2192 V V and D \u2192 (S, A, T )(P, V ) decays\n\nD \u2192VV\nA\n\nhandful\n\nnumber\n\nof\n\nK\u0304 \u22170 \u03c10 ,\n\nK \u2217\u2212 \u03c1+ ,\n\nK \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 ,\n\n\u03c10 \u03c10 ,\n\nVV\n\u03c6\u03c10 ,\n\nmodes,\nK\u0304 \u22170 \u03c9\n\nand\n\nsuch\nDs+\n\nas\n\u2192\n\nD+\n\n\u03c1+ \u03c6,\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03c1+ \u03c9,\n\nK\u0304 \u22170 \u03c1+ ,\n\nK \u2217+ K\u0304 \u22170 ,\n\nD0\n\n\u2192\n\nhave been ob-\n\nserved. These decays have a richer structure as they have three partial-wave or helicity states.\nNa\u0131\u0308vely it is expected from the factorization hypothesis that the longitudinal polarization is\n\n26\n\n\fdominant. However, the Mark III measurement [73] has indicated that the branching fraction of\nthe decay D 0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 \u03c10 is already saturated by the transverse polarization state, while longitudinal\nand transverse polarizations are comparable in D 0 \u2192 K \u2217\u2212 \u03c1+ (see, e.g., [74] for a detailed\ndiscussion). A Dalitz-plot study of four-body D decays will be helpful to resolve the puzzle.\nD \u2192 (S, A, T )(P, V )\n\nThanks to the powerful Dalitz plot analyses of multi-body decays of D mesons, the structure of\n\nmany resonances can be probed. Besides the vector meson resonances, many parity-even states such\nas the scalar mesons a0 (980), f0 (980), f0 (1370), f0 (1500), f0 (1710), a0 (1450), K0\u2217 (1430), the axialvector mesons a1 (1260), K1 (1270), K1 (1400) and the tensor mesons f2 (1270), a2 (1320), K2\u2217 (1430)\nhave been studied. Branching fractions of quasi-two-body decays D \u2192 SP, V P, T P with S, A, T\n\nstanding for scalar, axial-vector and tensor mesons, respectively, can be extracted from the Dalitz\nanalyses of three-body decays of D mesons. The study of D \u2192 SP opens a new avenue to the\nunderstanding of the light scalar meson spectroscopy, recalling that the underlying structure of light\nscalar mesons \u03c3, \u03ba, a0 (980) and f0 (980) is not well established experimentally and theoretically.\nThe topological amplitudes for D \u2192 SP, AP, T P decays have been discussed in [75\u201377]. There\n\nare several new features. First, one generally has two sets of distinct external W -emission and\ninternal W -emission diagrams, depending on whether the emitted particle is a party-even meson\nor a parity-odd one. Let us denote the primed amplitudes T \u2032 and C \u2032 for the case when the emitted\nmeson is a parity-even one. Secondly, because of the smallness of the decay constants of parityeven mesons except for the 3 P1 axial-vector state, it is expected that |T \u2032 | \u226a |T | and |C \u2032 | \u226a |C|.\n\nThis feature can be tested experimentally. Thirdly, since K0\u2217 and the light scalars \u03c3, \u03ba, f0 , a0 fall\ninto two different SU(3) flavor nonets, one cannot apply SU(3) symmetry to relate the topological\n\u22170\n\namplitudes in D + \u2192 f0 \u03c0 + to, for example, those in D + \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + . Finally, we notice that the new\n\ndata of quasi-two-body decays have been accumulated in the past years to the extent that they\nwarrant a serious theoretical study.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe have studied in this work the two-body hadronic charmed meson decays, including both\nthe P P and V P modes. The latest experimental data are first analyzed in the diagrammatic\napproach. The magnitudes and strong phases of the flavor amplitudes are extracted from the\nCabibbo-favored (CF) decay modes using \u03c72 minimization. The best-fitted values are then used\nto predict the branching fractions of the singly-Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) and doubly-Cabibbosuppressed decay modes in the flavor SU(3) symmetry limit. In doing so, we have observed SU(3)\nbreaking effects more significant than the two-body hadronic bottom meson decays.\nIn Section II, we find from the CF P P modes that\n\u25e6\n\nC = (2.61 \u00b1 0.08) e\u2212i(152\u00b11) ,\n\nT = 3.14 \u00b1 0.06,\n\n27\n\n\f+20 \u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\ni(31\u221233 )\nA = (0.39+0.13\n\u22120.09 ) e\n\ni(122\u00b12)\nE = (1.53+0.07\n,\n\u22120.08 ) e\n\n(43)\n\nfor the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle \u03c6 = 40.4\u25e6 inferred by KLOE [21]. Due to the larger branching fractions\nof K\u0304 0 \u03b7 and \u03c0 + \u03b7 (\u2032) modes, the magnitudes of T and C quoted above are larger than previously\nobtained. Also, the T and C amplitudes subtend a strong phase of about 150\u25e6 . Moreover, the E\nand A amplitudes are roughly perpendicular to each other.\nIn the case of V P modes, we find two possible solutions for the TV , CP , and EP amplitudes, as\ngiven in Table VII. The SCS V P modes D 0,+ \u2192 \u03c0 0,+ \u03c6 favor the solution with a large CP (namely,\n\nsolutions A and S in Table VII depending on which formula is used to extract the invariant\namplitude). By assuming that TP and TV are relatively real, we then obtain several possible\nsolutions for TP , CV , and EV , as listed in Table VIII. Again, only one of them (solutions A1 and\nS1, with the largest TP ) is in better agreement with the SCS V P modes, such as the Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7\n\nmode. In this case, |(T, C, E)P | > |(T, C, E)V |. The conclusion does not change much even if\n\nwe make the relative phase between TP and TV a free parameter because it turns out to be very\nclose to zero. Finally, the AP and AV amplitudes cannot be completely determined based on\ncurrently available data. Instead, we use the non-observation of Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c10 to argue that they\n\nare of similar magnitudes, and use the measured rate of Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 to show that they are much\n\nsmaller in size than the color-suppressed ones. However, this leads to a contradiction with data, as\nB(Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ ) > B(Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K + ) while the former is dominated by CV and the latter by CP .\n\nSo a full determination of the AP and AV amplitudes still await more precise data on the related\n\nmodes. We conjecture that the currently quoted experimental results for both Ds+ \u2192 K\u0304 0 K \u2217+ and\nDs+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 are overestimated and problematic.\n\nIn Section III, we compare the sizes of color-allowed and color-suppressed tree amplitudes\n\nextracted in Section II with the effective parameters a1 and a2 defined in the factorization approach.\nThe extracted a2 , as given in Table X, is significantly larger than that obtained from short-distance\ncalculations. The ratio |a2 /a1 | is more or less universal among the D \u2192 K\u0304\u03c0, K\u0304 \u2217 \u03c0 and K\u0304\u03c1 modes.\n\nThis feature allows us to discriminate between different solutions of topological amplitudes. The\nrelative strong phase extracted from the K\u0304\u03c1 modes and that from the K\u0304\u03c0 and K\u0304 \u2217 \u03c0 modes are all\nin the vicinity of 180\u25e6 , as expected from na\u0131\u0308ve factorization.\nSome Cabibbo-suppressed modes exhibit sizable violation of flavor SU(3) symmetry. We find\nthat part of the SU(3) breaking effects can be accounted for by SU(3) symmetry violation manifested in the color-allowed and color-suppressed tree amplitudes. However, in other cases such as\nthe ratio R = \u0393(D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 )/\u0393(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), SU(3) breaking in spectator amplitudes is not\n\nsufficient to explain the observed value of R. This calls for the consideration of SU(3) violation in\nthe W -exchange amplitudes. Since weak annihilation topologies in D \u2192 P P decays are dominated\n\nby nearby scalar resonances via final-state rescattering (for example, the resonance K0\u2217 (1950) helps\nexplain the magnitude and phase of E), we argue that the long-distance resonant contribution\nthrough the intermediate state f0 (1710) can naturally explain why D 0 decays more copiously to\nK + K \u2212 than \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 through the W -exchange topology. This has to do with the dominance of the\n\n28\n\n\fscalar glueball content of f0 (1710) and the chiral-suppression effect in the decay of a scalar glueball\ninto two pseudoscalar mesons. The same FSI through the f0 (1710) pole contribution also explains\nthe occurrence of D 0 \u2192 K 0 K\u0304 0 . However, in contrast to D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , this channel vanishes under\n\n\u2217V\nSU(3) symmetry owing to the cancelation of CKM matrix elements Vcs\u2217 Vus and Vcd\nud and the fact\n\nthat f0 (1710) is composed of a scalar gluonium and a small amount of SU(3) singlet in the SU(3)\nlimit.\nThe CF decays Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c0 0 , \u03c10 \u03c0 + , \u03c0 + \u03c9, \u03c1+ \u03c9 proceed only through the W -annihilation topol-\n\nogy. Owing to the G-parity selection rule, Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c9 does not receive contributions from the\nshort-distance W -annihilation and resonant FSIs. Nevertheless, it can proceed through the weak\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndecays Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 ( ) followed by the final-state rescattering of \u03c1+ \u03b7 ( ) into \u03c0 + \u03c9 through quark\n\nexchange. In contrast, Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c9 can be induced by resonant FSIs and hence it is anticipated to\n\nhave a larger rate.\n\nFinally we have made some brief remarks on other hadronic decays such as D \u2192 V V and\n\nD \u2192 (S, A, T )P , the detailed investigation of which is left to a future work.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to B.
