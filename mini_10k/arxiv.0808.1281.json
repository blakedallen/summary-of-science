A collection of simple closed curves in R3 is called a negative slice if it is the intersection of a flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian\nsurface and {y2 = a} for some a < 0. Examples and non-examples of\nnegative slices are given. Embedded Lagrange cobordisms define a relation on slices and in some (and perhaps all) cases this relation defines a\npartial order. The set of slices is a commutative monoid and the additive\nstructure has an interesting relationship with the ordering relation.\n\n1. Introduction\nAs part of his study of geometric optics, Arnold introduced the notion of\nan immersed Lagrange cobordism in T \u2217 (B \u00d7 [0, 1]) between immersed Lagrangians in the projection of the boundary to T \u2217 (B \u00d7{0}) and T \u2217 (B \u00d7{1}),\n[1]. The equivalence classes of oriented immersed Lagrangians up to immersed Lagrange cobordism form a group, which Arnold computed in the\ncase of Lagrangian curves in R2 to be Z \u2295 R, where the Z records the\nMaslov class and the R records the signed area bounded by the curve. Note\nthat these invariants are both homological in nature; in general, immersed\nLagrange cobordism obeys an h-principle [4], and hence computations of\nthe groups can be approached using algebraic topology (see [2]). That\nis, immersed Lagrange cobordism is a \"flexible\" phenomenon in symplectic topology. Passing to embedded Lagrange cobordism between embedded\nLagrangians, in contrast, yields a \"rigid\" theory: embedded Lagrangians\nin R2 are simply circles, and Chekanov proved that all cobordisms must\nbe cylinders between circles of equal area [3]. In particular, the cobordism\ngroup is the free abelian group generated by R>0 . Further rigidity is evidenced by Eliashberg's result that there is a unique Lagrange cobordism (up\nto isotopy) between two circles of the same area [5]. In this paper, we will\nconsider an intermediate situation: we insist that the cobordisms be embedded, but the Lagrangians at the ends may be immersed (in fact, we will\nrecord the three-dimensional configuration of the boundary). As we shall\nsee, cobordisms give rise to a relation between their ends that is no longer\nPE and JDL were supported as undergraduate summer research students by the Haverford College faculty support fund.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nP. EISEMAN, J. LIMA, J. SABLOFF, AND L. TRAYNOR\n\nan equivalence relation, but rather a partial order in certain (and perhaps\nall) cases.\nMore precisely, the objects we study are \"slices\" of \"flat-at-infinity\" Lagrangian submanifolds of R4 . Consider R4 with the standard symplectic\nform dx1 \u2227 dy1 + dx2 \u2227 dy2 . Let L0 denote the Lagrangian x1 x2 -plane in\nR4 , which can also be thought of as the zero-section of T \u2217 R2 . We say that\nan embedded Lagrangian submanifold is planar if it is diffeomorphic to\nR2 ; a planar Lagrangian is flat-at-infinity if it agrees with L0 outside a\ncompact subset of R4 . For example, the graph of the differential of any\ncompactly supported smooth function F : R2 \u2192 R is a flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian. It will be convenient to denote by La the intersection of a\nLagrangian L with the hyperplane {y2 = a}. Let ia : R3 \u2192 {y2 = a} \u2282 R4\ndenote the inclusion. Then a link S \u2282 R3 is a (generic) negative Lagrangian slice if there exists a flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian L \u2282 R4\nand an a < 0 such that L is transverse to the hyperplane {y2 = a} and\nLa = ia (S).\nLet Se denote the set of all negative Lagrangian slices together with the\nempty set. The projection of the non-empty elements of Se to the x1 y1 -plane\nwill be the unions of immersed curves where each component bounds zero\nsigned area and has winding number 0. It will be convenient to represent a\nslice by a \"diagram\" in the x1 y1 -plane that records the over/under strand\nwith respect to the x2 -coordinate at double points of the projection. Given\ne \u2282 R3 will denote a link that projects to\na diagram D in the x1 y1 -plane, D\ne is an x2 -lift\nD bijectively at all non-crossing points of D; in other words, D\nof D.\ne\nWe consider the set of slices up to an equivalence relation: for S1 , S2 \u2208 S,\nsay that S1 \u223c S2 if there exists a compactly supported area-preserving\ndiffeomorphism \u03c6 of the x1 y1 -plane so that (\u03c6 \u00d7 id)(S1 ) = S2 . Let\ne \u223c\nS = S/\ndenote the set of equivalence classes of slices. By our equivalence relation, we\ncan work with relatively combinatorial representations of slices, as diagrams\nneed only be defined up to area-preserving diffeomorphism: Figure 1 shows\nsome diagrams of negative slices, while Figure 2 shows some diagrams of\nclosely related unknotted curves that cannot be realized as negative slices;\nsee Sections 3 and 4.3 for proofs.\ne\nEmbedded Lagrange cobordisms define relations C and E on S:\ne we say that S C S 0 if there exists a\nDefinition 1.1. Given S, S 0 \u2208 S,\nflat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian L and a < b < 0 so that ia (S) = La and\nib (S 0 ) = Lb . The relation E is defined analogously with a \u2264 b < 0.\nIn Section 2, we will show:\nProposition 1.2. The relations C and E are well-defined on S.\nExample 1.3. Using the notation of Figure 1, we have the following relations:\n\n\fA PARTIAL ORDERING ON SLICES OF PLANAR LAGRANGIANS\n\nA\n(a)\nA1\nA1\n\nA2\n\nA2\n\nA3\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\nA1\nA1\n\nA2\n\nA2\n\nA3\n\n(c)\n\n(e)\n\nFigure 1.

In fact, on\nthe subset Sc \u2282 S of connected slices, we can show that the cobordisms\ndefining E give rise to a partial order:\nTheorem 1.4. Using the notation of Figure 1,\n(1) The relation E is not symmetric: in particular, for all 0 < A < B,\n[e\n8+ (A)] E [e\n8+ (B)], while [e\n8+ (B)] 6E [e\n8+ (A)].\n(2) Not all slices are related: in particular, for any A, B > 0,\ne (+,\u2212,+) (A, B, B)], and [C\ne (+,\u2212,+) (A, B, B)] 6E [e\n[e\n8+ (A)] 6E [C\n8+ (A)].\n(3) The relation E gives Sc the structure of a partially ordered set.\nThe second part of the theorem implies that Sc is not totally ordered\nby E. We believe that the relation E gives the entire set S the structure\nof a partially ordered set. However, the obstructions used in the proof of\nantisymmetry work only with flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangians, and the\ngluing operations used in the proof of transitivity and antisymmetry may,\nin general, take us outside that set.\nFurther structure on S is suggested by the second part of Example 1.3:\nthe curve e\n8+ (A1 ) + e\n8+ (A2 ) can be thought of as a sum of slices. In fact, S\nbecomes a commutative monoid when addition is defined by disjoint union:\nDefinition 1.5. For S, S0 \u2208 S, let S \u2208 S, S 0 \u2208 S0 , S \u2282 {x1 < 0}, and\nS 0 \u2282 {x1 > 0}. Define:\nS + S0 = [S \u222a S 0 ].\nThat this addition is well-defined on S will be proven below in Section 2.\nThe additive structure has an interesting interaction with the relations E\nand C:\nTheorem 1.6.\nular,\n\n(1) The relation E is not compatible with +: in partic-\n\n[\u2205] E [e\n8+ (A)] and [e\n8+ (A)] E [e\n8+ (A)], but [e\n8+ (A)] 6E [e\n8+ (A)] + [e\n8+ (A)].\n(2) The strict relation C is compatible with +: for all S, S0 , T, T0 \u2208 S,\nif S C S0 and T C T0 then S + T C S0 + T0 .\n\n\fA PARTIAL ORDERING ON SLICES OF PLANAR LAGRANGIANS\n\n5\n\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we verify that\nE, C, and + are well-defined on S; we also prove part (2) of Theorem 1.6.\nSection 3 describes constructions of the examples in Figure 1. Section 4\ndiscusses the machinery of slice capacities, a concept introduced in [7], in\norder to provide obstructions to certain curves being realized as elements of Se\nand to show that certain relations between elements of S do not exist. These\ncapacities, influenced greatly by ideas of Viterbo [8], are defined through\nthe theory of generating families, and it is for this reason that we restrict\nourselves to flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangians. Calculations of capacities\nprove parts (1) and (2) of Theorem 1.4 and part (1) of Theorem 1.6. Finally,\nSection 5 contains the proof of part (3) of Theorem 1.4, namely that E is a\npartial order on the set of connected slices Sc .\nAcknowledgments. We thank V.I. Arnold for his many inspirational ideas\nand beautiful results over the years.\n2. Relations and Operations\nIn this section, we will verify that the relation C and the operation + are\ne\nwell-defined with respect to the equivalence relation \u223c on S.\n2.1. The Definition of C and E. We first show that the relation C (and\nE) is well-defined with respect to the equivalence on the set of slices.\nProof of Proposition 1.2. Suppose that S0 C T0 via the flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian L at levels a < b < 0. Suppose further that S0 \u223c S1\n(resp. T0 \u223c T1 ) via a diffeomorphism generated by the Hamiltonian function Ht (x1 , y1 ) (resp. Gt (x1 , y1 )); here we are using the fact that the areapreserving diffeomorphisms guaranteed by \u223c are necessarily Hamiltonian.\nChoose interval neighborhoods Ua and Ub of a, b \u2208 R so that Ua \u2229 Ub = \u2205\nand 0 \u2208\n/ Ub ; choose smaller neighborhoods Va \u2282 Ua and Vb \u2282 Vb of a and b.\nThen let \u03c3 : R \u2192 R be a smooth function that is equal to 1 on Va and to 0\noutside Ua . Similarly, let \u03c4 : R \u2192 R be equal to 1 on Vb and to 0 outside\nUb . It is then straightforward to verify that\n(2.1)\n\nHt (x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 ) = \u03c3(y2 )Ht (x1 , y1 ) + \u03c4 (y2 )Gt (x1 , y1 )\n\ngenerates a Hamiltonian isotopy of R4 taking L to a flat-at-infinity planar\nLagrangian joining S1 to T1 .\n\u0003\n2.2. The Definition of +. To show that the sum S + S0 is well-defined,\nwe will prove the following proposition:\nProposition 2.1.\n(1) The sum S + S0 does not depend upon the choice\nof representatives of S in {x1 < 0} or of S0 in {x1 > 0}.\n(2) The sum of two elements of S is again an element of S.\n\n\f6\n\nP. EISEMAN, J. LIMA, J. SABLOFF, AND L. TRAYNOR\n\nProof of Part (1). Suppose that S and S\u0304 are both representatives of S in\n{x1 < 0}; it suffices to show that S \u222a S 0 \u223c S\u0304 \u222a S 0 . By hypothesis, there\nexists a compactly supported area-preserving isotopy \u03c6t of the x1 y1 -plane so\nthat (\u03c61 \u00d7 id)(S) = S\u0304. We construct a compactly supported area-preserving\nisotopy \u03c6\net of {x1 < 0} so that (\u03c6\ne1 \u00d7 id)(S) = S\u0304 as follows. Choose \u000f > 0 so\nthat S, S\u0304 \u2282 {x1 < \u2212\u000f}. There exists an area-preserving diffeomorphism \u03c4 so\nthat \u03c4 ({x1 < 0}) = R2 and \u03c4 is the identity on {x1 \u2264 \u2212\u000f}. Then \u03c4 \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c6t \u25e6 \u03c4\nis a compactly supported area-preserving isotopy of {x1 < 0} that extends\nby the identity to a compactly supported area-preserving isotopy \u03c6\net of R2\n0\n0\nwith the property that (\u03c6\ne1 \u00d7 id)(S \u222a S ) = (S\u0304 \u222a S ).\n\u0003\nThe proof of the second part of the proposition - that the sum of two\nelements of S is again an element of S - relies upon two constructions. The\nfirst is that there is a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism that can shift the level\nof slices:\nLemma 2.2. For any a < b < 0, there is a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism \u03c8\nso that \u03c8 is the identity on {y2 \u2265 b}, and on {y2 \u2264 a}, \u03c8 is a translation\nby m in the y2 -direction for any m < b \u2212 a.\nProof. Consider the Hamiltonian H(x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 ) = \u03c3(y2 )x2 , where \u03c3(y2 ) is\na smooth function such that\n(\n0, y2 \u2265 b\n\u03c3(y2 ) =\nm, y2 \u2264 max{a, a + m}.\nIt is easy to verify that H generates an integrable vector field that gives the\ndesired \u03c8.\n\u0003\nThe second construction is that of a \"connect sum\" for flat-at-infinity\nplanar Lagrangians.\nDefinition 2.3. Given two flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangians L, L0 , a connect sum of L and L0 , denoted L#L0 is defined as follows. Assume L (resp.\nL0 ) agrees with the zero-section L0 outside a compact set K (resp. K 0 ) of\nR4 . Choose x1 -translations \u03c4 of L and \u03c4 0 of L0 so that \u03c4 (K) \u2282 {x1 < 0}\nand \u03c4 0 (K 0 ) \u2282 {x1 > 0}. Then L#L0 is defined to be\n(\u03c4 (L) \u2229 {x1 \u2264 0}) \u222a (\u03c4 0 (L0 ) \u2229 {x1 \u2265 0}).\nThe following lemma shows that, up to Hamiltonian isotopy, the construction of the connect sum does not depend on \u03c4 and \u03c4 0 .\nLemma 2.4. Let L#L0 and L#\u0303L0 be two connect sums with respect to\nx1 -translations \u03c4, \u03c4 0 and \u03c4\u0303 , \u03c4\u0303 0 . Then there exists a compactly supported areapreserving isotopy \u03c6t of the x1 y1 -plane so that (\u03c61 \u00d7 id)(L#L0 ) = L#\u0303L0 .\nProof. Choose sets U, U 0 in the x1 y1 -plane containing the projections of\nK, K 0 of Definition 2.3. There exists a compactly supported area-preserving\nisotopy \u03c6t translating \u03c4 (U ) to \u03c4\u0303 (U ) and \u03c4 0 (U 0 ) to \u03c4\u0303 0 (U 0 ) that preserves\n{y1 = 0}. It follows that (\u03c61 \u00d7 id)(L#L0 ) = L#\u0303L0 , as desired.\n\u0003\n\n\fA PARTIAL ORDERING ON SLICES OF PLANAR LAGRANGIANS\n\n7\n\nWith these two constructions, we can prove the second part of the proposition:\nProof of Proposition 2.1(2). Suppose that S \u2208 S, S \u2282 {x1 < 0}, ia (S) =\nLa , and that S 0 \u2208 S0 , S 0 \u2282 {x1 > 0}, and ib (S 0 ) = L0b . By Lemma 2.2, we\nmay assume that a = b. At the cost of passing to equivalent slices using the\ncompactly supported translation construction from the proof of part (1), we\nmay then conclude that (L#L0 )a is a representative of S + S0 .\n\u0003\n2.3. Proof of Theorem 1.6(2). We begin by generalizing the level-shifting\nlemma:\nLemma 2.5. Consider a flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian L and its slices\nLa , Lb for some a < b < 0. Then for all c < d < 0, there exists a flat-atinfinity planar Lagrangian M so that La \u223c Mc and Lb \u223c Md .\nProof. M is obtained by applying a composition of level-preserving Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms as in Lemma 2.2 to L.\n\u0003\nWe can now easily prove that the strict relation C is compatible with +:\nProof of Theorem 1.6(2). We know there exist flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangians L and M and representatives S \u2208 S, etc., such that for some\na < b < 0 and c < d < 0,\nib (S 0 ) = Lb\n\nid (T 0 ) = Md\n\nia (S) = La\n\nic (T ) = Mc .\n\nBy Lemma 2.5, we may assume that a = c and b = d. Then the connect sum\nL#M gives a flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian with [(L#M )a ] = S + T and\n[(L#M )b ] = S0 + T0 .\n\u0003\n3. Constructions of Slices and Cobordisms\nFigure 1 gives examples of x1 y1 -diagrams of negative slices. The unknotted figure-8 diagram with a positive self-crossing bounding two lobes of area\nA shown in Figure 1(a) will be denoted by 8+ (A). Choose A1 , A2 , A3 so\nthat A1 \u2212 A2 + A3 > 0. Then the \"caterpillar\" with three crossings of signs\n+, \u2212, + and four lobes of areas A1 , A2 , A3 , and A4 = A1 \u2212 A2 + A3 shown\nin (b) will be denoted by C +\u2212+ (A1 , A2 , A3 ). The two component sum of\nunknotted figure-8's with positive crossings shown in (c) will be denoted by\n8+ (A1 ) + 8+ (A2 ). The figure-8 \"inside\" another figure-8 shown in (d) will\nbe denoted by 8\u2212 (A1 ) 8+ (A2 ). Lastly, the \"merged\" figure-8's shown in\n(e) will be denoted by 8\u2212 (A1 , A2 ) \u00d7 8+ (A3 ).\nThat each of these curves is the diagram of a negative slice of an embedded, flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian may be proven by examining the\ngraph of dF for an explicit function F : R2 \u2192 R. In [7], an explicit generating family is constructed to generate the curve in (a), and modifications\nof this construction can be used to generate many of the specified slices.\nOther slices were found through computer-aided calculations; the first two\n\n\f8\n\nP.

Capacities. For each slice La of a flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian L\nat a generic height a, we define two lower and two upper capacities:\n\u2217\ncL,a\n\u00b1 : H (La ) \u2192 (\u2212\u221e, 0],\n\nL,a\nC\u00b1\n: H \u2217 (La ) \u2192 [0, \u221e).\n\nBelow is a brief description of the construction of these capacities from the\ntheory of generating families. Full details and citations can be found in [7];\nthe original constructions that inspired these capacities appear in Viterbo's\npaper [8].\nIf L \u2282 R4 is a flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian then there is a quadraticat-infinity generating family F : R2 \u00d7 RN \u2192 R for L.

Obstructions to the Existence of Slices. We begin our exploration\nof the use of capacities as obstructions by showing that certain curves cannot\nappear as negative slices of flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangians. The simplest\nexample is that 8\u2212 (A) cannot be the diagram of a negative slice; this follows\nimmediately from Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 4.3.\nMore interestingly, some slight modifications of the realizable caterpillar\ndiagram in Figure 1(b) cannot be the diagram of a negative slice.\nProposition 4.4. Consider A1 , A2 , A3 so that A1 \u2212 A2 + A3 > 0.

Suppose C \u2212\u00b1\u2212 (A1 , A2 , A3 ) is the diagram of a negative slice of the\nflat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian L. We will show that cL,a\n\u2212 (u) = 0 and\nL,a\n0\nC+ (u) = 0, for all u \u2208 H (La ).

For (u1 , u2 ) \u2208 H 0 ((L1 #L2 )a ) = H 0 ((L1 )a ) \u2295 H 0 ((L2 )a ),\n1 #L2 ,a\n1 ,a\ncL\n(u1 , 0) = cL\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 (u1 ),\n\n1 #L2 ,a\n2 ,a\ncL\n(0, u2 ) = cL\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 (u2 ),\n\nL1 #L2 ,a\nL2 ,a\n1 ,a\nand c\u00b1\n(u1 , u2 ) = max{cL\n\u00b1 (u1 ), c\u00b1 (u2 )}.\n\nProof. By Lemma 2.4 and Invariance, it suffices to work with a connect sum\nobtained by choosing the compact sets Ki in Definition 2.3 quite large. Using\nstabilization, fiber-preserving diffeomorphism, and addition of constants, we\ncan assume that there exist generating families for L1 and L2 that agree\nwith the same quadratic function outside K1 and K2 . Thus there exists a\ngenerating family F (x1 , x2 , e) for L1 #L2 so that, for some \u000f > 0, F (x1 , x2 , e)\ngenerates the x1 -translate of L1 on {x1 < \u2212\u000f}; F (x1 , x2 , e) generates the\nx1 -translate of L2 on {x1 > \u000f}, and on |x1 | < \u000f, F (x1 , x2 , e) agrees with\na quadratic function Q(e). It follows that on x1 < \u2212\u000f, x1 -translates of\nL1 #L2 ,a\n1 ,a\nthe gradient trajectories used to define cL\n(u1 , 0),\n\u00b1 (u1 ) will define c\u00b1\nL1 ,a\nL1 #L2 ,a\nand hence the value c\u00b1 (u1 ) agrees with c\u00b1\n(u1 , 0). An analogous\n1 #L2 ,a\nargument holds on x1 > \u000f. The claimed calculation of cL\n(u1 , u2 )\n\u00b1\nfollows from the definition.\n\u0003\nUsing this, we can show that the result of repositioning the two figure-8\ncurves of opposite crossings in Figure 1(d) so that they are configured as in\nFigure 4 cannot be realized as the diagram of a negative slice of a connect\nsum of Lagrangians:\nCorollary 4.6. For any A, B > 0, 8\u2212 (A) + 8+ (B) cannot be realized as\nthe diagram of a generic negative slice of any connect sum of flat-at-infinity\nplanar Lagrangians.\nProof. Suppose there exists L1 #L2 and an a < 0 so that (L1 #L2 )a has\ndiagram 8\u2212 (A) + 8+ (B). Then the inclusion of the slice induces ja\u2217 u =\n(u, u), for all u \u2208 H 0 (L). By Lemma 4.5 and Theorem 4.1, it follows that\nL1 #L2 ,a \u2217\n1 #L2 ,a\ncL\n(ja\u2217 u) = 0. By index calculations and Lemma 4.2, C\u00b1\n(ja u) =\n\u00b1\n0. Thus we get a contradiction to Non-Vanishing.\n\u0003\nOn the other hand, capacity arguments do not rule out the possibility of\n+ 8+ (B) appearing as the diagram of a negative slice of any flat-atinfinity planar Lagrangian.\n8\u2212 (A)\n\n\f14\n\nP. EISEMAN, J. LIMA, J. SABLOFF, AND L. TRAYNOR\n\n4.4. Obstructions to the Existence of Cobordisms. We continue our\nexploration of the use of capacities as obstructions by proving parts (1) and\n(2) of Theorem 1.4. Combining Theorem 4.1 and Monotonicity yields part\n(1) of the theorem: for all 0 < A < B, we have:\n[e\n8+ (A)] E [e\n8+ (B)], while [e\n8+ (B)] 6E [e\n8+ (A)],\nwhere e\n8+ (A), e\n8+ (B) are any slices with diagrams 8+ (A), 8+ (B).\nTo prove part (2), namely that for all positive areas A and B,\ne +\u2212+ (A, B, B)] and [C\ne +\u2212+ (A, B, B)] 6E [e\n[e\n8+ (A)] 6E [C\n8+ (A)],\ne +\u2212+ (A, B, B), we use Monotonicity, Theorem 4.1,\nfor any lifts e\n8+ (A) and C\nand the following capacity computation:\nLemma 4.7. If L is any flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian with negative\nslice La that has diagram C +\u2212+ (A, B, B) then, for 0 6= u \u2208 H 0 (La ), cL,a\n\u2212 (u) =\n\u2212A.\nProof. As in the analysis of C \u2212+\u2212 (A, B, B) in the proof of Proposition 4.4,\nthe difference function \u2206a has six critical points whose indices and critical\nvalues are the same as before, but with the roles of P+ and P\u2212 reversed.\nL,a\nLet u \u2208 H 0 (La ). By Lemma 4.2, we know that cL,a\n+ (u) = 0 = C\u2212 (u).\nL,a\nBy a similar argument to the one in Proposition 4.4, C+\n(u) = 0. By\nL,a\nNon-Vanishing, it must be the case that c\u2212 (u) 6= 0. Further, since the\ncritical value for both of the index N critical points is \u2212A, we must have\ncL,a\n\u0003\n\u2212 (u) = \u2212A, as desired.\nThe proof of Theorem 1.6(1), namely that the relation E is not compatible\nwith the addition +, also relies on a capacity computation:\nLemma 4.8. Let L be any flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian having a generic\nheight a < 0 so that La has diagram 8+ (A) + 8+ (A). Then, for any nonzero\nu \u2208 H 0 (La ), cL,a\n\u2212 (u) = \u2212A.\nProof. For the difference function \u2206a , there are four non-degenerate critical\npoints: two in P+ with value A and index N + 3 and two in P\u2212 with value\n\u2212A and index N . By these calculations, it follows that for all u \u2208 H 0 (La ),\nL,a\nL,a\ncL,a\n+ (u) = 0, C+ (u) = 0, and C\u2212 (u) = 0. Then by the Non-Vanishing\nproperty of capacities, for any nonzero u \u2208 H 0 (La ), cL,a\n\u2212 (u) 6= 0. Since\nL,a\nc\u2212 (u) must be a critical value associated to a critical point of index N , we\nthen know that cL,a\n\u0003\n\u2212 (u) = \u2212A.\nTheorem 4.1, Lemma 4.8, and Monotonicity then imply Theorem 1.6(1):\nfor any A > 0,\n[e\n8+ (A)] 6E [e\n8+ (A)] + [e\n8+ (A)].\n\n\fA PARTIAL ORDERING ON SLICES OF PLANAR LAGRANGIANS\n\n15\n\n5. (Sc , E) as a Partially Ordered Set\nAs stated in Theorem 1.4(3), the restriction of the relation E to the\nset Sc of connected slices is a partial order, i.e. E is reflexive, transitive,\nand antisymmetric. Reflexivity is obvious from the definition. The proofs\nof transitivity and antisymmetry both require us to glue together two Lagrangians along a common slice. The first step in this endeavor is to prove\nthat any two collar neighborhoods of a generic slice are equivalent:\nLemma 5.1. Let L, L0 \u2282 R4 be two flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangians that\nare transverse to and agree on {y2 = a}:\nS = La = L0a .\nThen, for all \u000f > 0, there exist neighborhoods V \u2282 U of S in L and a\nsymplectic isotopy \u03a6t of R4 so that \u03a6t |L is the identity on S and on the\ncomplement of U , \u03a61 (U ) \u2282 {a \u2212 \u000f < y2 < a + \u000f}, and \u03a61 (V ) \u2282 L0 .\nProof. By a result of Eliashberg and Polterovich [6], there is a symplectomorphism \u03c8 of R4 taking L to L0 , the zero-section of R4 = T \u2217 R2 . Let \u03b3 be the\nimage of S under \u03c8. Let A be the disjoint union of annuli around the components of S in L0 . By the transversality assumption, for sufficiently small A,\nthe Lagrangian G = \u03c8(A) will be the graph of a 1-form, necessarily closed,\nover a neighborhood C of \u03b3. This 1-form vanishes on each component of \u03b3,\nand so we can assume G is the graph of an exact 1-form dg. Since there exists\ng so that both g and dg vanish on \u03b3, for an arbitrary \u03b4 > 0, we can construct\na bump function \u03c1 so that kd(\u03c1g)k < \u03b4. Now consider the symplectic isotopy \u03c6t of T \u2217 R2 given by \u03c6t (x, y) = (x, y + t d(\u03c1g)(x)). We may choose this\nisotopy to displace L0 by as little as we want. Further, we have \u03c6t (\u03b3) = \u03b3,\n\u03c61 (L0 ) agrees with G in a neighborhood of \u03b3, and \u03c6t |L0 = id outside C.\nThen \u03a6t = \u03c8 \u22121 \u03c6t \u03c8 is the desired isotopy since we may assume that we have\nchosen C and \u03b4 small enough so that \u03a6t (U ) \u2282 {a \u2212 \u000f < y2 < a + \u000f}.\n\u0003\nThus, we obtain the following gluing construction for flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangians meeting at a connected slice:3\nProposition 5.2. Let L, L0 \u2282 R4 be two flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangians\nthat are transverse to and agree on {y2 = a}:\nS = La = L0a .\nIf S is connected then, for all \u000f > 0, there exists a flat-at-infinity planar\nLagrangian L00 such that:\n(1) L00 \u2229 {y2 < a \u2212 \u000f} = L \u2229 {y2 < a \u2212 \u000f} and\n(2) L00 \u2229 {y2 > a + \u000f} = L0 \u2229 {y2 > a + \u000f}.\nProof. The previous lemma shows that we may glue two flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangians L and L0 along a common slice S to obtain a new flat-atinfinity Lagrangian L00 . The fact that S is connected allows us to use the\n3This is the only place where we use the connectivity assumption.\n\n\f16\n\nP. EISEMAN, J. LIMA, J. SABLOFF, AND L. TRAYNOR\n\nJordan curve theorem to show that, topologically, the gluing removes and\nthen replaces a disk from the upper Lagrangian, thus resulting in another\nplanar Lagrangian.\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to prove transitivity and antisymmetry.\nProof of Transitivity. The only nontrivial case to prove is when S1 C S2 and\nS2 C S3 . This means that (up to equivalence) there exist flat-at-infinity\nplanar Lagrangians L and L0 and real numbers a < b < 0 and a0 < b0 < 0\nsuch that for some representatives Si \u2208 Si ,\nib (S2 ) = Lb\n\nib0 (S3 ) = L0b0\n\nia (S1 ) = La\n\nia0 (S2 ) = L0a0 .\n\nBy Lemma 2.2, we may assume that b = a0 . We now apply Proposition 5.2\nto glue L to L0 along S2 to obtain a flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian joining\nS1 to S3 .\n\u0003\nProof of antisymmetry. To prove antisymmetry, we use the capacities defined in Subsection 4.1 and argue by contradiction. Suppose that S E S0\nand S0 E S, but that S 6= S0 . It follows that, possibly after an equivalence,\nthere are Lagrangians joining the representative slices S and S 0 (and vice\nversa). Suppose that the x1 y1 -projection of S has n double points. Using\nLemma 2.5 and Proposition 5.2, we may construct a flat-at-infinity planar\nLagrangian L with slices L\u22121 \u223c L\u22122 \u223c * * * \u223c L\u2212(n+1) \u223c S. Note that this\nconstruction yields difference functions \u2206\u2212k , k = 1, . . . , n + 1, that all have\nthe same 2j nonzero critical values, for some j \u2264 n, with j of them positive\nand j of them negative. If u is any nonzero class in H \u2217 (L) then we claim\nthat cL,\u2212(n+1) (i\u2217 u) = 0 for all four capacities, a contradiction to the NonVanishing property. To prove the claim, notice that Monotonicity implies\nthat:\nL,\u2212(n+1) \u2217\ncL,\u22121\n(i\u2217 u) \u2264 cL,\u22122\n(i\u2217 u) \u2264 * * * \u2264 c\u2212\n(i u) \u2264 0.\n\u2212\n\u2212\nSince these capacities can only take on the j \u2264 n negative critical values\nor 0 and each negative critical value can occur at most once, we must have\nL,\u2212(n+1) \u2217\nc\u2212\n(i u) = 0.
