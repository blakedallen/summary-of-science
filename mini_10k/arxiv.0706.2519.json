It had been originally assumed that the WAT shape was due to the host\ngalaxy's swift motion through the ICM (Owen & Rudnick 1976). This is seen with Narrow\nAngle Tail (NAT) galaxies as they plow through the gas in the outer regions of clusters\n(Miley et al. 1972) with large peculiar velocities. The canonical view of WATs puts them\nat or near the center of their cluster's potential well with low peculiar velocities (v \u2264 300\nkm s\u22121 ) relative to the intracluster medium. Given the low peculiar velocities and the\nassumed densities and velocities of the particles within the WAT sources (Eilek et al. 1984;\nO'Donoghue et al. 1993), this NAT analogy seems to fail as a scenario to produce the bent\ntail morphology in WATs.\nIt has been argued that cluster mergers can produce the ICM ram pressure necessary to\nshape WAT sources (Burns et al. 1994; Pinkney 1995; G\u00f3mez et al. 1997; Sakelliou & Merrifield\n2000). Elongations of a cluster's X-ray emission along the line that bisects the WAT\n(G\u00f3mez et al. 1997), significant offset (\u2265 100 kpc) of the WAT from the X-ray centroid\n(Sakelliou & Merrifield 2000), and the presence of X-ray sub-structure (Burns et al. 1994;\nG\u00f3mez et al. 1997) have all been observed in WAT-hosting clusters and are assumed to be\nindicators of a recent cluster merger. Simulations have shown that relative velocities of the\nICM, great enough to bend WATs, are produced in mergers and persist on time scales greater\nthan the lifetime of the radio sources (107 -108 years) (Roettiger et al. 1993; Loken et al. 1995;\nRoettiger et al. 1996; Ricker & Sarazin 2001).\nLarge velocities relative to the ICM resulting from cluster mergers may not be required\nto bend the WAT if a model of high flow velocity and low density is assumed within the\nradio lobes (Burns & Balonek 1982; Eilek et al. 1984; O'Donoghue et al. 1990; Pinkney 1995;\nHardcastle et al. 2005). Hardcastle et al. (2005) assume this model arguing that galaxy\nvelocities as low as 100-300 km s\u22121 are sufficient to produce the WAT morphology in some\nclusters. In previous models as mentioned above, denser lobes with lower flow velocities\nrequire galaxy velocities greater than 1000 km s\u22121 .\nAbell 1446 is a low redshift (z = 0.1035) galaxy cluster of richness class 2. The bright\ncentral galaxy is a large elliptical (Mv = \u221223.4) which is host to the radio source 1159+583,\none of the six objects originally defining the WAT class in Owen & Rudnick (1976). Abell\n1446 has been previously imaged by both the Einstein (Burns & Balonek 1982) and ROSAT\nobservatories (G\u00f3mez et al. 1997). Here, we report on the results of a 59 ksec Chandra observation of Abell 1446, which is the highest resolution observation, spatially and spectrally,\nof the cluster to date. The greatly improved spatial resolution is necessary to probe the sub-\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nstructure of the ICM within the central 100 kpc where the radio lobe and ICM interaction\nis taking place. The WAT production mechanisms discussed above will be investigated for\nthis cluster. Unless otherwise noted, all uncertainties are given to 90% accuracy. We assume\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03a9M = 0.3, and Ho = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . At z = 0.1035, the angular diameter\ndistance is D\u0398 = 392.14 Mpc, the luminosity distance is DL = 477.53 Mpc, and 1\u2032\u2032 = 1.9\nkpc.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION\n2.1.\n\nChandra Observation\n\nAbell 1446 was observed by Chandra on 2004 September 29 for a total of 59,120 seconds\nin very faint (VFaint) mode. The center of the cluster was positioned on the S3 chip of Chandra's ACIS-S detector with a 1\u2032 offset from the nominal pointing to avoid node boundaries.\nThe data analysis package, CIAO version 3.2, was used for data reduction. By analyzing\nlight curves of the S1 and S3 chips throughout the observation period, it was determined\nthat no background flares occurred to contaminate the data. The data were corrected for\nhot pixels and cosmic ray afterglows using standard techniques. Background files were taken\nfrom the blank sky observations of M. Markevitch included in the CIAO calibration database\n(CALDB) and reprojected to match the A1446 observation.\n\n2.2.\n\nRadio Reductions\n\nRadio data presented in this paper for 1159+583 were extracted from the NRAO VLA\narchive. Observations in A configuration at 1452.4 and 1502.4 MHz were taken in 1986\nMarch 26 (VLA code AO62), while C configuration observations at 1464.9 and 1514.9 MHz\nfor the same project code were taken in 1985 July 17. A second frequency band was also\nreduced in order to study the spectral properties of the radio source. The data were taken for\nCLA code AO49 at 4835.1 and 4885.1 MHz in 1984 February 17 in the VLA B configuration\nand 1984 August 5 in the VLA D configuration.\nAll observations used 3C286 as a flux calibrator and data were calibrated and reduced\nwith the NRAO Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS). Images at each configuration\nwere produced through the standard Fourier transform deconvolution method. All data sets\nwere processed through several loops of imaging and self-calibration to reduce the effects of\nphase and amplitude errors in the data. The A and C configuration observations were added\ntogether to produce a final image with an rms of 82 \u03bcJy/bm while the combined B and D\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nconfiguration data has an rms of 31 \u03bcJy/bm.\n\n3.\n\nSPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF CLUSTER EMISSION\n\nAn adaptively smoothed image of the cluster 800 kpc (421\u2032\u2032 ) on a side is shown in Fig.\n1. It was created using the csmooth task in CIAO with a minimum SNR of 3. It has been\ncorrected for background and exposure. The photon energy range has been restricted to\n0.3-7.0 keV. From this image it can be seen that some substructure is present. While on\nlarger scales the cluster appears to be approximately circularly symmetric, the inner 200 kpc\n(105\u2032\u2032 ) show anisotropies in the distribution of the gas. Most prominently, there appears to\nbe a filamentary excess of emission to the north of the AGN and a bright area of emission\nto the southeast.\nThe contours of the smoothed cluster image have been overlaid on the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey image (Fig 2.). The peak of the X-ray emission corresponds with the large elliptical\ngalaxy which is the host of the WAT and approximately at the center of the cluster.\n\n3.1.\n\nPoint Sources\n\nIndividual sources were detected using the wavelet detection algorithm wavdetect in\nCIAO. Of the 20 sources that were detected, four correspond with sources in the USNO A2.0\ncatalog. Those sources that were identified in the Chandra image are the central R = 15.69\nmag elliptical galaxy, an R = 17.7 mag galaxy 100\u2032\u2032 to the northeast of the central galaxy, an\nR = 19.9 mag galaxy 125\u2032\u2032 to the west-northwest, and an R = 16.9 mag galaxy 125\u2032\u2032 to the\nnorthwest. All are cluster members. The four wavdetect sources were identified within 1\u2032\u2032\nof their optical counterparts suggesting that there is no positional offset of the X-ray image.\nTherefore no astrometric correction has been applied to the data. These sources can be seen\nas the red squares in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) image of the cluster (Fig. 2).\n\n3.2.\n\nCluster Center and Ellipticity\n\nTo determine the center and projected ellipticity of the X-ray emission, isophotes were\nfit to a 2\u2032\u2032 Gaussian smoothed image of the cluster. This was done using the ellipse task,\nincluded in the STSDAS package of IRAF. The center position, eccentricity, and pitch angle\nwere all allowed to vary. The point sources were replaced with values interpolated from\nthe surrounding regions using dmfilth in CIAO. The ellipse task found two center positions,\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ndepending on the radius of the isophote. The centers of the isophotes with semi-major\naxes \u2264 45\u2032\u2032 are coincident with the AGN (X-ray point source coincident with the radio\ncore of 1159+583) while those isophotes with greater semi-major axes are centered near a\nposition 25\u2032\u2032 to the northeast. As a test, the analysis techniques discussed in this paper\nwere performed assuming the cluster center is coincident with the AGN, the position 25\u2032\u2032 to\nthe northeast of the AGN, and points in-between. No significant variation in the result was\nobserved using the different cluster centers. With the majority of the bright central emission\ncentered about the WAT, except where noted, the AGN is used as the center of the cluster\nthroughout the paper. The position 25\u2032\u2032 to the northeast of the AGN is considered to be the\ncenter of the more diffuse large-scale emission. Due to the low ellipticity (e \u2264 0.16) of the\nisophotes with radii larger than 45\u2032\u2032 , it was decided that A1446 may be treated as roughly\ncircularly symmetric. This assumption allows for the use of circular annuli in the analysis\nprocess discussed below.\n\n3.3.\n\nSurface Brightness Profile\n\nAssuming large-scale circular symmetry, a surface brightness profile in the energy band\n0.3-10.0 keV was extracted from 22 concentric annuli centered on the AGN with each annulus\ncontaining at least 1000 source counts (Fig. 3). The profile was corrected for background\nand exposure with the point sources, including the AGN, excluded. A one-dimensional beta\nmodel was fitted to the data in CIAO's modeling and fitting application Sherpa. The fit\nis good with a reduced \u03c72 = 0.51 with 19 degrees of freedom. The model parameters are\n+0.016\n+29.67\n\u03b2 = 0.43+0.075\n\u22120.041 with a core radius Rc = 79.76\u221216.51 kpc and a peak amplitude of 0.089\u22120.006\ncts s\u22121 arcmin\u22122 . While the beta values overlap within the errors, the core radius differs\nsignificantly from that determined in G\u00f3mez et al. (1997) using ROSAT data where \u03b2 =\n0.7\u00b10.2 and Rc = 260 \u00b1 14 kpc. This discrepancy is most likely due to ROSAT 's larger field\nof view. Surface brightness profiles of clusters of galaxies tend to be best fit by a double\n\u03b2-model and rich clusters such as A1446 tend to exhibit a steeper surface brightness profile\nat large radii (\u03b2 \u223c 0.7). Here we are fitting the surface brightness profile of the cluster core\nas opposed to the large-scale cluster emission as had been done by G\u00f3mez et al. (1997). A\ndouble beta model was fit to the data. The parameters for the two models were calculated\n+2.7\n+62.7\n+2.7\nto be Rc,1 = 230+1300\n\u2212100 kpc, \u03b21 = 0.7\u22120.21 and Rc,2 = 290\u2212209 kpc, \u03b22 = 7.3\u22123.9 with the\npeak amplitudes being 0.05 and 0.04 respectively. For this fit the reduced \u03c72 = 0.32 with\n16 degrees of freedom. Though the values of the model match those of G\u00f3mez et al. (1997)\nmore closely, the uncertainties are very large.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.4.\n\nICM and WAT Interaction\n\nThe central elliptical galaxy within Abell 1446 is host to the prototypical WAT radio\nsource 1159+583. The source consists of two radio lobes bending in the characteristic Cshape that is typical of WAT sources. The center of the radio emission is coincident with\nthe area of brightest X-ray emission in the cluster and within 25\u2032\u2032 (47 kpc) of the center of\nthe large-scale cluster emission determined above. This suggests that the host galaxy, as\nthe largest member of A1446, has sunk nearly to the bottom of the cluster's gravitational\npotential well. While the southern lobe's projected length extends to a distance of roughly\n105 kpc (55\u2032\u2032) from the host galaxy, the northern lobe ends only 45 kpc (24\u2032\u2032 ) northeast of\nits host in projection. Both the northern and southern lobes seem to be bending towards\nthe southeast. On close visual inspection (Fig. 4), the northern lobe appears to have carved\nout a cavity within the cluster gas. An excess of emission is seen between the lobes.\n\n3.5.\n\nCluster Substructure\n\nAs can be seen in the smoothed image of the cluster (Fig. 1), the X-ray emission\nin the central regions is not symmetrically distributed about the cluster center. This was\ninvestigated more closely by fitting the smoothed X-ray image with an isophotal model. A\nGaussian smoothed (\u03c3=4\u2032\u2032 ) image was used as input in the IRAF ellipse task. The ellipticity\nand position angle were free to vary while the center was fixed at an intermediate value\nbetween the AGN and the large-scale center. When fitting the central 150 kpc (79\u2032\u2032 ) the\nposition angle varied to some degree suggesting the presence of substructure in the X-ray\ngas as had been previously seen in G\u00f3mez et al. (1997). Using ROSAT data, G\u00f3mez et al.\n(1997) detected the excess of emission to the northeast of the cluster as a significant X-ray\nclump. An excess to the west of the center was also detected. A smooth elliptical model of\nsurface brightness was created from the table of elliptical isophotes returned by the ellipse\ntask. This model was then subtracted from the Gaussian smoothed image to reveal any\nexcess emission. The model was weighted by 0.7 in order to avoid over subtracting. This\nresidual image is shown in Fig. 5. An excess can be seen directly north of the AGN as well\nas to the southeast. The radio lobes correspond to regions of reduced emission (particularly\nthe northern lobe).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n4.\n\nSPECTRAL ANALYSIS\n4.1.\n\nTotal Spectrum\n\nA spectrum was extracted from a region of radius 190\u2032\u2032 around the center of the cluster\nusing ACISSPEC in the CIAO package. The central AGN along with other X-ray point\nsources mentioned above were excluded. The spectrum was binned such that each energy\nbin contained a minimum of 40 counts after the background had been subtracted. Restricting\nthe energy range to 0.7-7.0 keV, a number of models were fitted to the spectrum using XSPEC\nV11.3.2. The three models that were fitted to the spectrum were: a single temperature model\naccounting for the thermal bremsstrahlung emission of the hot ICM including line emission\nfrom several elements (1-MEKAL), a MEKAL model accounting for two populations of hot\ngas at different temperatures (2-MEKAL), and a cooling flow model (MKCFLOW) combined\nwith a single temperature MEKAL model. Temperature, abundance, and normalization were\nfree parameters. Each model was run twice, with the absorption parameter free to vary and\nthen fixed at the Galactic value of 1.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Dickey & Lockman 1990). The lack\nof an improved fit with the addition of a second MEKAL component or an MKCFLOW\ncomponent is consistent with the cluster ICM being comprised of nearly isothermal gas. The\naverage temperature of the inner 360 kpc of the ICM was determined to be 4.00 \u00b1 0.19 keV\nwith an average abundance value of 0.34 \u00b1 0.07 Z\u2299 from the single MEKAL fit with fixed\nGalactic absorption.\nTable 1: XSPEC fits to the X-ray spectrum of the inner 190\u2032\u2032 radius region\nNote: numbers within parenthesis indicate frozen values.\nModel\nMEKAL\nMEKAL\nMEKAL+MEKAL\nMEKAL+MEKAL\nMEKAL+MKCFLOW\nMEKAL+MKCFLOW\n\nNH\n(1020 cm\u22122 )\n\nkTlow\n(keV)\n\nkThigh\n(keV)\n\nAbundance\n(Z\u2299 )\n\n\u1e40\nM\u2299 yr\u22121\n\n(1.50)\n2.12\u00b11.3\n(1.50)\n2.78+1.66\n\u22121.51\n(1.50)\n2.71+1.75\n\u22121.44\n\n...\n...\n+78.1\n1.8\u22121.7\n+78.0\n1.93\u22121.84\n1.80+4.10\n\u22121.72\n1.80+4.10\n\u22120.51\n\n4.00\u00b10.19\n3.92\u00b10.25\n+75.6\n4.26\u22120.08\n+75.4\n4.48\u22124.40\n4.70+3.58\n\u22120.84\n5.59+2.82\n\u22121.78\n\n0.34\u00b10.07\n0.33\u00b10.07\n0.33\u00b10.07\n0.29\u00b10.08\n0.33\u00b10.07\n0.30\u00b10.07\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n56.78+3391\n\u221256.78\n93.03+1183\n\u221293.03\n\n\u03c72 /dof\n345/308\n344/307\n344/306\n344/306\n344/306\n342/305\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n1.12\n1.12\n1.13\n1.13\n1.13\n1.12\n\nThe X-ray temperature measurement is in agreement with previously derived temperatures for the A1446 ICM in Burns & Balonek (1982), kT = 4+5\n\u22122 keV, and G\u00f3mez et al. (1997),\n+1.3\nkT = 2.6\u22120.7 keV, using Einstein and ROSAT data, respectively. While the G\u00f3mez et al.\n(1997) value is slightly lower than the value determined in this paper, they agree to within\nthe errors.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n4.2.\n\nTemperature and Abundance Profiles\n\nSpectra were extracted from 10 concentric annuli centered on the AGN. Each annulus\nhad roughly 2500 net source counts with the central AGN and other X-ray point sources\nexcluded. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the temperature remains roughly constant (4.0 keV)\nout to a radius of 400 kpc (210\u2032\u2032). This is an indication that the cluster is not the site of a\ncooling flow. Cooling flow clusters typically exhibit a sharp decrease in temperature within\nthe central region to roughly one-half the value in the outer regions (Peterson et al. 2003).\nThere is also an absence of any significant temperature discontinuities that would result from\na recent large-scale cluster-cluster merger. There is a slight jump in temperature at a radius\nof 150 kpc (79\u2032\u2032 ) which may correspond to a hot subclump of gas present in the ICM.\nAn abundance profile was extracted using five concentric annuli centered on the AGN.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 6, the profile values and uncertainties restrict the abundance to the\nrange 0.20-0.55 Z\u2299 in the four inner annuli. The radial profile for the chemical abundance\ndoes not show any definite radial dependence with an average value of \u223c 0.34 Z\u2299 .\nThe values of temperature and chemical abundance determined from the radial profiles agree well with the average values determined from the best-fitting single-temperature\nMEKAL model of the total cluster spectrum. Due to the uncertainties in the abundances,\nthe average value determined from the total cluster spectrum was used below (\u00a74.3).\n\n4.3.\n\nTemperature Map\n\nA temperature map was created of a region 375 kpc (197\u2032\u2032 ) on a side centered on the\nAGN. Each value on the temperature map was determined by extracting a spectrum from\nthe smallest surrounding region on the chip that contains 1000 total counts. Each spectrum\nwas fit to a single temperature MEKAL model with the value of the chemical abundance\nfrozen at 0.34 Z\u2299 , the value from the fit to the whole cluster. The two dimensional map\nwas then smoothed with a Gaussian of \u03c3=4\u2032\u2032 . The temperature map can be seen in Fig.\n7. Again, there is no evidence for a cooling flow. The temperature map agrees well with\nthe temperature profile from above as there is no strong evidence of a radial dependence\non temperature. As seen in the temperature profile, values of temperature are constant\nwith radius when averaged over annuli. However, the temperature map reveals temperature\nvariations within the cluster. Such a variation can be seen 150 kpc (79\u2032\u2032 ) to the southeast\nof the cluster center. To investigate this further a spectrum was extracted from an elliptical\nregion coincident with the region of enhanced temperature seen in the map. The temperature\nof this region, with semimajor and minor axes of 25\u2032\u2032 and 12\u2032\u2032 and position angle 20\u25e6 west of\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nnorth, was determined to be kT = 5.93+2.06\n\u22121.21 keV. The temperature of the surrounding gas in\n\u25e6\n\u2032\u2032\na 60 wedge of radius 197 was found to be kT = 3.72+0.47\n\u22120.33 . This region lies along the line\nbisecting the bent radio source and will be discussed in \u00a76.1.1. Along this same line, but to the\nnorthwest of the WAT, there appears to be another region of increased temperature. Upon\nfurther analysis, extracted spectra reveal that the temperature difference is not significantly\ngreater than the neighboring regions. The uncertainty of the temperature values in the map\nis roughly 15% at the center, reaching 40% towards the edges.\n\n4.4.\n\nLX \u2212 T Relation\n\nIt has been observed that galaxy clusters exhibit a correlation between their X-ray luminosity and temperature. Following the method described in Wu et al. (1999), we determined\nthe total bolometric luminosity and global temperature of Abell 1446. The Chandra observation of A1446 only extends out to \u223c360 kpc (190\u2032\u2032 ) from the cluster center. The bolometric\nluminosity of this region was calculated from the total cluster spectrum discussed above\naccounting for redshift and cosmology. A 'dummy' response file was created to allow the\nspectral model to be evaluated from 0.001-100 keV. The contribution of the ICM emission not\nincluded on the S3 chip was then estimated. This was done by extrapolating the G\u00f3mez et al.\n(1997) \u03b2-model fit to the ROSAT surface brightness out to infinity. The G\u00f3mez et al. (1997)\nmodel was used as it is more consistent with \u03b2-model fits of rich clusters of galaxies and\ncovers a larger radial extent, requiring less extrapolation, than the Chandra profile. From\nthis analysis it appears that A1446, given its global temperature, has a luminosity falling\nalong the LX \u2212 T trend when compared with the Wu et al. (1999) sample. This can be seen\nin Fig. 8. From the simulations of Ritchie & Thomas (2002), clusters undergoing major\nmergers have boosts in their X-ray luminosity and temperature such that they follow the\nslope of the relation, but generally fall above the trend line throughout the duration of the\nmerger. As seen in Fig. 8, Abell 1446 falls slightly below.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nPressure, Density, and Mass\nPressure and Density Profiles\n\nThe pressure and density profiles were calculated using the projected temperatures\ndetermined from the radial profile. Assuming spherically symmetric shells, a routine that\ndeconvolves the X-ray surface brightness was used to give the emissivity as a function of\nradius. Assuming the emissivity is due to thermal bremsstrahlung and constant within the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nspherical shells, the pressure and density were calculated. As can be seen in Fig. 9, pressure\nand density generally decrease with increasing radius. A lack of a sharp jump in the radial\nprofile for pressure indicates an absence of a large-scale shock that would be present if\na violent cluster-cluster merger were taking place near the plane of the sky. While the\nuncertainties of values along the pressure profile are large enough so that the trend follows a\nrelatively smooth decline with radius, we can establish an upper limit on a possible pressure\n'discontinuity' at 80\". Moving outward across this point the pressure may decrease by as\nmuch as a factor of \u223c 1.9, possibly indicating the presence of a weak shock. From a radius\nof roughly 400 kpc (210\u2032\u2032 ), the density increases by a factor of 10 to a core density of 3.9 \u00d7\n10\u22123 cm\u22123 . The gas pressure also increases by a factor of ten from a radius of 400 kpc (210\u2032\u2032 )\n\u221211\nto its core. The pressure reaches a value of 5.32+0.50\ndyne cm\u22122 near the cluster\n\u22120.49 \u00d7 10\ncenter. Using ROSAT data, G\u00f3mez et al. (1997) found the pressure near the center to be\n7.44 \u00d7 10\u221212 dyne cm\u22122 . This difference may be a result of the larger core radius \u03b2-model\nfrom which they determined density, along with their lower global cluster temperature.\n\n5.2.\n\nCooling Time\n\nUsing the temperature and density profiles determined above, the cooling time of the\nintracluster gas can be calculated (Fig. 9). In relaxed cooling core clusters, the cooling times\nin the central regions of the cluster are much less than a Hubble time [see Sarazin (1988)\nand references therein]. The short cooling time allows the cooling core to form. The cooling\ntimes of the gas in the central regions of A1446 are greater than the age of the universe,\nsuggesting that there has not been enough time, given the properties of the gas, for a cooling\nflow to begin. This is in agreement with the flatness of the temperature profile. The cooling\ntime for the innermost annulus is tcool = 15.5 Gyr.\n\n5.3.\n\nGas and Gravitational Mass\n\nThe gas and gravitational mass were determined using a routine that deconvolves the Xray surface brightness of the extended emission to give emissivity and density as a function\nof radius. These are integrated to give the gas mass as a function of radius. The total\ngravitational mass was derived from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium. As can be\nseen in Fig. 10, the gas mass fraction (ratio of gas mass to gravitational mass, GMF) at\nthe cluster core is \u223c0.02 which climbs with increasing radius to \u223c0.1 at 400 kpc (210\u2032\u2032 )\nwhich is a typical value for the GMF for galaxy clusters at this radius (Allen et al. 2004).\nThe total mass contained within 400 kpc is 5 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 . The profile is missing a point\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nat the same radius where there is an increase in pressure. Since the mass is determined\nassuming hydrostatic equilibrium, such a change in pressure implies the system is not fully\nrelaxed. The failure of hydrostatic equilibrium at this radius may be a signature of cluster\nsubstructure.\n\n5.4.\n\nPressure Map\n\nA map of projected pressure was created from the temperature map and smoothed\nimage of the cluster. Assuming the X-ray emissivity, \u01ebX \u221d n2e and P \u221d ne T , the square root\nof the counts image was multiplied by the temperature map (Finoguenov et al. 2005). The\nvalues of pressure are arbitrary and the map displays the pressure, in projection, relative to\nthe cluster center (Fig. 11). The pressure map exhibits the radial dependence on pressure\nseen in the radial profile. A region of high pressure is seen to the southeast of the cluster\ncenter coincident with the temperature enhancement present in the temperature map. There\nappears to be some correlation between the southern radio lobe and the region of increased\npressure with which it is coincident. The higher pressure region around the cluster center\nextends towards the northwest and a filamentary region of increased pressure can be seen\ndirectly to the north. The anisotropies of the two-dimensional temperature and pressure\ndistributions suggest that subclumps of different temperatures and pressures are present in\nthe ICM. Such subclumps may be identified as remains of a small-scale merger or infalling\nor rising cluster gas.\n\n6.\n6.1.\n\nDISCUSSION\nSmall-scale Merger\n\n6.1.1. Merger Along WAT Axis\nBased on X-ray observations of WAT-hosting clusters it has been argued that large-scale\ncluster-cluster mergers and smaller scale cluster-subcluster mergers may be responsible for\nproducing the WAT class of radio sources (Burns et al. 1994; Pinkney 1995; G\u00f3mez et al.\n1997; Sakelliou & Merrifield 2000). N-body merger simulations suggest specific observational characteristics are produced as a result of these cluster collisions (Roettiger et al.\n1993; Loken et al. 1995; Roettiger et al. 1996). The X-ray surface brightness distribution\nis expected to become elongated along the merger axis and the central cD or D WAT\nhost may become displaced from the large-scale center of the X-ray emission. Shocks\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nare expected to form initially along the merger axis and later perpendicular to this axis\n(Roettiger et al. 1996). During the merger the X-ray luminosity of the ICM is thought to\nincrease (Schindler & Mueller 1993) due to an increase in ICM density. Significant X-ray\nsubstructure should develop and persist within the ICM, and it is probable that cooling flows\nshould be absent or disrupted (McGlynn & Fabian 1984; G\u00f3mez et al. 2002). It is assumed\nthat the ICM ram pressure during the cluster mergers is great enough to bend the WAT\nradio sources. Bulk flow velocities are believed to remain above 1000 km s\u22121 within \u223c200\nkpc of the cluster core for periods as long as 2 Gyr after the initial collision (Loken et al.\n1995; Roettiger et al. 1996). This time scale is much longer than the assumed lifetime of\nthe radio sources (107 -108 yrs). The bulk motion and increased density of the ICM may\nalso result in ram-pressure stripping of the cooler interstellar medium of galaxies within the\nclusters (Schindler 2002).\nWhile Abell 1446 does not exhibit the tell-tale signs of a recent large-scale clustercluster merger, such as elongation of the X-ray emission or large pressure contrasts that\nwould indicate a significant shock, there is possible evidence of a small-scale merger of a\nsub-cluster or group. Along the line that bisects the opening angle of the WAT there appear\nto be enhancements in the two-dimensional maps of temperature and pressure as well as\nan excess of soft emission. Such an excess, lying 20 kpc to the southeast of the central\ngalaxy could possibly be a result of ram-pressure stripping of the central galaxy's interstellar\nmedium by bulk flow of the ICM, the remnant cool core of the pre-merger cluster, or the\ncore of an infalling group of galaxies (\u00a76.1.2).\nUnder the assumption that ICM ram pressure produced in cluster mergers shapes the\nWAT radio source, the line that bisects the WAT radio lobes should be aligned with the\nmerger axis. Simulations have shown that shocks propagate outward from the cluster center\nalong the merger axis as the subcluster passes through the core (Roettiger et al. 1996). As\nseen in the two-dimensional maps of temperature and pressure there is possible evidence of a\nweak shock along the merger axis to the southeast of the WAT. This region is roughly 50\u2032\u2032 (95\nkpc) by 24\u2032\u2032 (46 kpc) with a temperature of kT = 5.93+2.06\n\u22121.21 keV as compared to its adjacent\n+0.47\ncooler regions where kT = 3.72\u22120.33 keV (as discussed in \u00a74.3). In projection, the pressure\nmap shows a region of higher pressure coincident with this region of increased temperature\nto the southeast of the WAT. The region has a pressure roughly 1.6 times greater than the\nsurrounding ICM pressure. This region of enhanced pressure is coincident with the slight\npressure irregularity in the radial profile discussed in \u00a75.1. We can determine an upper limit\non the pressure ratio across the possible pressure discontinuity to be \u223c1.9. This corresponds\nto a Mach number of 1.3, or a merger shock velocity of \u223c1460 km s\u22121 , determined from\nRankine-Hugoniot jump conditions assuming a sound speed of 1120 km s\u22121 for 4 keV gas.\nIn the classic model of WATs, such velocities are thought to be great enough to bend the\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nradio sources into their swept back shape (Burns et al. 1986).\nAs the relative velocities of the ICM during the merger of a subcluster may shape the\nWAT radio source, it's possible the ICM conditions can also result in ram pressure stripping\nof the ISM contained within the cluster galaxies. In X-ray observations and simulations it has\nbeen seen that elliptical galaxies can be stripped of their X-ray halos as they plow through\nthe denser ICM near the cluster center (Takeda et al. 1984; Merrifield 1998; Stevens et al.\n1999; Drake et al. 2000; Toniazzo & Schindler 2001). It has been suggested that elliptical galaxies within merging clusters experience this ISM stripping as well (Schindler 2002;\nSakelliou et al. 2005). The temperature of the X-ray halo is generally \u2264 1 keV, thus cooler\nthan the surrounding gas of the ICM. When the gas of the galactic ISM is stripped by the\nram-pressure of the ICM, it is thought to leave a dense trail, or wake of cooler gas. Such a\nwake was recently discussed in Sakelliou et al. (2005) associated with the WAT 4C 34.16 and\nits host galaxy. They argue that the wake, visible between the WAT lobes in a softness ratio\nimage, was produced as the host galaxy fell into the cluster. Given the ICM density of the\ncluster and the mass of the host galaxy, it was determined that a relative velocity of \u2265 1200\nkm s\u22121 was necessary to produce the observed wake. Through simulations, Acreman et al.\n(2003) show that an infalling elliptical galaxy becomes mildly supersonic and loses its Xray halo through ram pressure stripping during core crossing, reinforcing the wake claim of\nSakelliou et al. (2005). A soft X-ray image was created of A1446 to investigate the possible\npresence of a wake of stripped material behind the central galaxy, revealing substructure\nsurrounding the AGN. The energy range was restricted to 0.3-1.0 keV. This along with the\nhard X-ray image (1.0-10.0 keV) is shown in Fig. 12. A considerable excess in the soft image\nis present directly southeast of the AGN, between the lobes of the WAT. It was determined\nthat the excess is a significant enhancement over the average soft emission at the same radius\nfrom the AGN at the 2.85 \u03c3 level. A soft excess in this location is consistent with a wake of\ncooler galactic material having been stripped by the same ram-pressure that bent the WAT\nsource. In this case, the ram pressure is thought to have been supplied by a small-scale\ncluster merger. We approximate the wake to be within a spherical volume of radius rwake \u223c\n20 kpc, with a density \u223c 1.2 nICM estimated from the excess soft emission. From this we\ncalculate the mass of the wake to be Mwake \u223c 109 M\u2299 , which is comparable to the values for\nX-ray halos of elliptical galaxies (M = 106.5 -108 M\u2299 ) determined in Sun et al. (2007). While\nthe temperature map (Fig. 8) shows that the wake region is not significantly cooler than the\nambient medium, there is a substantial amount of projected cluster gas that may give this\nexcess emission the appearance of having a higher temperature.\nAnother explanation of this soft excess is that it may be the remnant cool core of the\npre-merger cluster. Within merging clusters it is believed that a pre-existing cooling core\nmay be disrupted if the ram pressure of the infalling cluster exceeds the thermal pressure\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nof the core (G\u00f3mez et al. 2002). The number of counts is not great enough to determine\nthe density and temperature of the excess to significant accuracy. As such, it is not possible\nto distinguish if it is the disrupted cool core of the pre-merger cluster, stripped interstellar\nmaterial of the host galaxy, or the core of an infalling group of galaxies.\n\n6.1.2. Infalling Cool Clump\nIt is possible that instead of a merger along the WAT axis, a group of galaxies, including\ngas cooler than the cluster's ICM, may be falling in from the north of the cluster. This cooler\ngas would then be responsible for bending the radio source as it sinks in the ICM towards\nthe cluster center. The excess of emission directly to the north of the AGN (Fig. 5) may\nbe such a clump of cool gas falling through the hotter ICM. This clump can be seen in\nthe adaptively smoothed image and residual image of the cluster as the bright filamentary\nstructure extending northward from the cluster center. The temperature map shows a region\ncoincident with the northern filamentary clump that is cooler than the ambient cluster gas.\nFollowing the method described in \u00a74.3 the temperature of this region was determined to be\n+0.69\nkT = 3.19+0.46\n\u22120.43 keV while the surrounding regions have a temperature of kT = 4.29\u22120.56 keV.\nThe cool infalling material may be a primary factor in the bending of the northern lobe.\nThe presence of the cool clump in the path of the radio source may impede the normally\nstraight large-scale flow of the energetic particles, forcing the structure to bend towards the\neast. What appears to be a wake in the WAT axis merger scenario may either be the leading\nportion of this infalling cool clump that has already fallen through the cluster center or\nthe bright edge of a bubble of compressed gas interacting with the northern lobe. It has\nbeen argued that the symmetry of WAT sources rules out the possibility that the separate\nlobes are shaped by individual small-scale clumps in the ICM (De Young 1991). While this\nscenario is able to explain the morphology of the northern radio lobe, it does not account\nfor the similar bending direction of the southern lobe.\n\n6.1.3. Line of Sight Merger\nWe examined spectroscopically determined redshifts of galaxies within a 2 Mpc radius\n(at z=0.1035) of the center of Abell 1446 available in the SDSS database. Within this radius\n50 galaxies were found to lie \u00b1 3000 km s\u22121 from the mean at \u223c 31000 km s\u22121 . Figure\n13 (left panel) shows the velocity distribution of these 50 galaxies presumed to be members\nof A1446. While the majority of the galaxies are within 1000 km s\u22121 of the central peak,\nconsistent with the velocity distribution of a moderately relaxed cluster, a secondary peak\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nof galaxies is offset from the central distribution by \u223c 1500 km s\u22121 . Such a velocity offset is\nconsistent with a merger of a subcluster occurring, at least partially, along the line-of-sight.\nThe right panel of Figure 13 shows the positions on the sky of the members of A1446 with\nSDSS redshifts. The galaxies are divided into two subsamples: lower velocity galaxies are\nshown as triangles while higher velocity galaxies are shown as circles. The majority of the\nlower velocity galaxies (9/10) roughly occupy the nothwest quadrant of the plot. These\ngalaxies are also generally distributed along the line that bisects the WAT, and possibly\nassociated with the northern filamentary excess shown in Fig. 5. The similarly low velocities\nof these galaxies, the coincidence of sky positions, and the bending direction of the WAT are\nall consistent with a merger of a subcluster occurring from the northwest to the southeast\nwith a significant component (\u223c 1500 km s\u22121 ) along the line-of-sight. Previously published\nvelocity measurements of the galaxies within Abell 1446 (Pinkney et al. 2000) do not show\nthis bi-modal velocity distribution. From a region of the sky 3 x 3 Mpc2 , they obtained\nspectra for 34 cluster members yet only 3 were within the lower velocity range depicted by\nthe triangles in Fig. 13.\nWhile there is evidence for a bi-modal velocity distribution (SDSS) in Abell 1446, with\nthe galaxies forming the secondary peak lying along the line that bisects the WAT, the\nsample is relatively small. Abell 1446 is of moderate richness (Abell richness class 2, 80-129\ngalaxies between m3 and m3 +2 (Abell 1958)) thus 50 galaxies is not a complete sampling of\nthe cluster velocity structure. Additional spectroscopic observations are required to increase\nthe number of spectra to N \u223c 100-200 to further investigate this possible line-of-sight merger.\n\n6.2.\n\nRadio Morphology and Galaxy Velocity Estimates\n\nWhen they were first observed, it was suggested that WATs could be created by the\nswift orbital motion of the host galaxy through a relaxed ICM (Owen & Rudnick 1976) as\nis often seen with Narrow Angle Tail (head-tail) galaxies. NATs are usually smaller cluster\nmembers that are orbiting the cluster center at great velocities farther from the core than\nWAT sources. These greater orbital velocities produce significant ram pressures allowing the\nlobes to be bent into a narrow angle. As mentioned in Burns (1981), the high velocity NAT\nexplanation fails for WATs as D and cD type galaxies are expected to lie at the center of\ntheir clusters with low peculiar velocities (vg < 300 km s\u22121 ).\nIt must be noted that while the direction of NAT tails has been found to be consistent\nwith random orbital motions of galaxies within their host clusters (O'Dea et al. 1987), some\ngalaxy clusters host multiple NATs with similarly oriented tails [e.g. Abell 119, Feretti et al.\n(1999)]. This along with the finding of Bliton et al. (1998) that NAT hosting clusters exhibit\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\na significant degree of X-ray substructure suggests that cluster mergers contribute in part to\nthe formation of these head-tail sources.\nUsing an Einstein image of A1446 along with 4.8 GHz VLA observations, Burns & Balonek\n(1982) examined 1159+583. They invoked a nonrelativistic hydrodynamic flow model to explore the radio plasma properties required to reproduce the observed bending. They assume\nthe host galaxy to be moving through the ICM with a velocity \u223c 200 km s\u22121 and argue that\nthe radio lobes are rising away from the dense cluster center. Within their model, buoyant\nand dynamic forces contribute equally to the shaping of the WAT. Euler's equation can then\nbe used in the form:\n\u03c1ICM vg2\n\u03c1r vr2\n=\n+ \u2207P\nrc\nrr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere rr is the radius of the lobe, \u03c1r is the mass density of the lobe, vr is the velocity of\nthe plasma within the lobe, rc is the radius of curvature of the source, vg is the velocity of\nthe host galaxy relative to the ICM, \u03c1ICM is the density of the ICM, and P is the ICM gas\npressure. The last term is due to buoyancy. They assume the relativistic electrons must\ntravel at > 104 km s\u22121 in order to travel between the galaxy core and the end of the lobe\nwithin their synchrotron lifetime [as computed in Burns et al. (1979)]. Given this velocity\nand the model above they determined the density of the plasma within the lobe to be < 2\n\u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123 .\nIn a survey of 11 WAT radio sources (including 1159+583), O'Donoghue et al. (1993)\nalso tested the possibility of source bending through slow galactic motion. Their first model,\nthe adiabatic model, assumed no acceleration of energetic particles outside the radio core.\nSuch a model is similar to that used in Burns & Balonek (1982). With no in situ particle\nacceleration in the lobes, O'Donoghue et al. (1993) found that the sources were easily bent\nby the galaxy's slow motion through the ICM. Although the lobes were found to bend easily\nwithin this model, they note that there were serious inconsistencies between the travel time\nof the particles down the lobe and their spectral age. Their second model, the kinetic model,\nis similar to that in Eilek et al. (1984) and assumes that particles are accelerated outside the\ncore by fluid processes. This requires that the radio luminosity is supplied by a fraction of the\nkinetic energy of the particles flowing down the lobe. The condition used to determine the\ninternal density required to produce the observed luminosity of the lobes, given the plasma\nflow velocity is:\n\nLrad =\n\n\u01eb\u03c0rr2 \u03c1r vr3\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nA form of Euler's equation (eq. 1 without the buoyancy term) is then used to determine\nthe velocity of the host galaxy relative to the ICM necessary to produce the bent WAT\nmorphology (Eq. 3) as:\n\nvg =\n\n\u0012\n\n2Lrad\n\u01eb\u03c0\u03c1ICM vr rc rr\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Lrad is the total radio luminosity of the lobe and \u01eb is the radiative efficiency (0.0010.1) which measures the conversion from kinetic to relativistic particle energy (Eilek 1979).\nGiven the more recent 1.4 GHz and 4.8 GHz VLA data, O'Donoghue et al. (1993) determined\na significantly different radio source geometry than that used in Burns & Balonek (1982).\nWhile Burns & Balonek (1982) used the radius of curvature and radio lobe radius values of\n200 kpc and 12 kpc respectively, O'Donoghue et al. (1993) used 16 kpc and 1 kpc. Such\ndifferent input parameters within this kinetic model significantly alter the result. Assuming\nthat the initial particle velocity is vr = 0.2c, decelerating to 0.11c at the bend, and that\n\u01eb < 0.01, O'Donoghue et al. (1993) found that a galaxy velocity of vg > 3400 km s\u22121 was\nnecessary to reproduce the observed bending of 1159+583. This value is calculated assuming\nnICM = 10\u22123 cm\u22123 . With the new Chandra data it was determined that nICM \u223c 0.0025 cm\u22123 ,\nso that a galactic velocity of 1800 km s\u22121 is required to bend the radio source.\nUsing VLA archival data of 1159+583, we re-examined the properties of the bent source.\nThe two different geometries chosen by Burns & Balonek (1982) and O'Donoghue et al.\n(1993) appear to be dependent on the scale over which the ICM/radio interaction is believed to be occurring. O'Donoghue et al. (1993) assume that the bending occurs predominantly at a position just downstream of the radio hotspots over a relatively short distance.\nBurns & Balonek (1982) instead assume the bending occurs across the entire source and as\nsuch measure a larger lobe radius and radius of curvature. Within the model that attributes\nthe bending of the radio source to relative bulk flow of the ICM, the ram pressure of the gas\nis believed to act on the entire source. As such, we will take the radius of curvature of the\nlarge-scale structure of 1159+583 as opposed to localized bends near the hotspots. A 1.4\nGHz map displays a radius of curvature \u223c 100 kpc with a lobe radius of \u223c 7 kpc, which is\nof the order of the Burns & Balonek (1982) values determined from lower resolution radio\ndata.\nA spectral index map of 1159+583 was obtained between frequencies near 1.4 GHz and\n4.8 GHz by convolving each data set to a common circular beam size of 1.61.\u2032\u2032 The resulting\nspectral index map was blanked at the 3\u03c3 level of each of the input frequencies and balanced\nbetween natural and uniform weighting for better sensitivity to diffuse emission. This can\nbe seen in Figure 13. The spectral index, \u03b1, of the northern jet is 0.6, where S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 . The\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nsouthern jet was not detected. From the spectral index map it can be seen that \u03b1 steepens\nwith increasing distance from the core with occasional regions of spectral flattening. At these\nlocations of spectral flattening, it is likely that a fraction of the kinetic energy is transferred\nto the relativistic particles (Muxlow & Garrington 1991). This re-energizes the particles\nand prevents the spectrum from showing significant signs of aging as the distance from the\ncentral engine increases. To examine this more closely a radial profile of the spectral index\nof the southern lobe was calculated from the 1.4 GHz and 4.8 GHz maps (Fig. 14). While\nthere is an overall steepening of the spectral index along the length of the southern lobe, the\nslope remains relatively shallow. This region of nearly constant spectral index between 15\u2032\u2032\nand 40\u2032\u2032 is consistent with in situ particle acceleration within the radio plasma (Parma et al.\n1999). Assuming this in situ particle acceleration, the global luminosity condition along with\nthe form of Euler's equation presented above (Eq. 3) can be used to estimate the galaxy\nvelocity necessary to produce the bent tail morphology. A significant buoyant force acting\non the radio lobes, included in the calculations of Burns & Balonek (1982), would result in\nthe radio plasma bending radially away from the cluster center as it rises in the ICM. Given\nthe orientation of the radio source relative to the large-scale X-ray emission it is difficult to\ndetermine the effect of buoyancy on the lobes (acting with or against ram-pressure). Thus\nthe \u2207P term in Eq. 1 is not included.\nThe luminosity condition (Eq. 2) is based upon the argument that some fraction (\u01eb) of\nthe kinetic energy of the bulk flow is converted to relativistic particle energy resulting in the\nobserved synchrotron emission. This value is not well known and has generally been assumed\nto be between 0.001-0.1. B\u0131\u0302rzan et al. (2004) attempted to constrain this value by examining\na sample of 16 galaxy clusters that have clear decrements in the X-ray emission coincident\nwith the lobes of cluster center radio sources. It is assumed that this decrement in X-ray\nemission is a result of the relativistic plasma of the radio sources carving out cavities in the\nICM. The energy necessary to evacuate the cavities can be estimated from the product of\nthe cavity volume and overlying ICM pressure. Assuming a standard time scale over which\nthe cavity is created (5 \u00d7 107 \u2212 108 yr), a kinetic luminosity can then be estimated. The\nefficiency (\u01eb) is then the ratio of total radio luminosity to kinetic luminosity. B\u0131\u0302rzan et al.\n(2004) still found that \u01eb ranged in values between 0.001-0.1 for their sixteen sources. This\nmethod results in a rough estimate of a radio source's kinetic efficiency. As such we carried\nout a similar analysis on A1446 and 1159+583 to compute \u01eb rather than simply choosing an\narbitrary value. There is a clear deficit of emission coincident with the northern radio lobe.\nA time scale of 5 \u00d7 107 yr was assumed which is consistent with the time required for the\ncavity to rise the projected distance from the radio core to its present location at the speed\nof sound. This results in the kinetic efficiency estimated as \u01eb \u223c 0.04.\nThe total luminosity of the source, which is dominated by the lobes, was found to be 3.4\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\u00d7 1042 ergs s\u22121 . This was determined using the 1.4 GHz flux as a reference and assuming a\npower law of spectral index \u03b1 = 0.85, taken as the average of the spectral index map. The\ntotal flux was calculated by integrating between 107 and 1011 Hz. From the total flux the\ntotal radio luminosity was determined accounting for its dependence on spectral index and\nredshift. With values for \u03c1ICM , rc , rr , \u01eb determined as 4.2 \u00d7 10\u221227 g cm\u22123 , 100 kpc, 7 kpc,\nand 0.04, respectively, the only unknown is vr . Previous estimates for the conditions within\nthe lobes of WATs (Sakelliou et al. 1996; Smolcic et al. 2006) have used observed effects of\nbuoyancy to constrain internal parameters. Their sources show apparent bends due to ram\npressure close to the host galaxy, but as the distance from the center increases the lobes bend\ntowards the opposite direction. This is the position where buoyancy balances ram pressure\nand is then used to constrain the internal density or flow velocity within the source. As\ndiscussed above the impact of buoyancy on the morphology of 1159+583 is unclear. There\nis no evident transition point where buoyancy balances ram pressure. While Sakelliou et al.\n(1996) and Smolcic et al. (2006) determined internal velocities of their WAT sources to be\nvlobe < 0.01c and vlobe \u223c 0.045c respectively, the flow velocity within the lobes of 1159+583\nremains poorly constrained.\nUsing a beaming analysis, the plasma flow velocities down the well collimated jets\nof WAT sources have been estimated to be between (0.3-0.7)c (Jetha et al. 2006). Flow\nvelocities within the lobes are less restricted but may be within the range of (0.005 - 0.2)c.\nFrom Eq. 3, this range of flow velocities results in a broad range of galaxy velocities (vg \u223c\n200-1000 km s\u22121 ) capable of bending 1159+583. It must be kept in mind that the value for\nkinetic efficiency (\u01eb = 0.04) is a rough estimate as well which contributes to the uncertainty\nin the galaxy velocity. Figure 15 shows a plot of plasma flow speed down the lobes versus\nkinetic efficiency. The diagonal line represents the combinations of plasma flow speed and\nkinetic efficiency required to bend the lobes into their observed shape given a galaxy velocity\nof 300 km s\u22121 (the upper limit for systematic galaxy motion about the cluster center (Burns\n1981; Quintana & Lawrie 1982; Malumuth 1992)). Any combination of efficiency and flow\nspeed that lies above this line is consistent with slow galaxy motion sufficiently bending the\nlobes. Any combination that falls below the line requires galaxy velocities greater than 300\nkm s\u22121 to bend the lobes, consistent with merger induced bulk flow of the ICM. Assuming our\nestimated kinetic efficiency of \u01eb \u223c 0.04, a plasma flow speed < 0.06c would require galaxy\nvelocities relative to the ICM consistent with conditions expected at the site of a cluster\nmerger. Recently, Hardcastle et al. (2005) argued that the slow galactic motion model can\nexplain WAT bending as long as the plasma flow in the lobes is faster and significantly less\ndense than the typical values used in previous models. From the global luminosity condition\n(taking \u01eb \u223c 0.1), and assuming flow speeds down the lobe > 0.08c they calculate that galactic\nvelocities as slow as 100-300 km s\u22121 are sufficient to bend the lobes of the WAT radio source\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n3C 465. With the kinetic efficiency in 1159+583 of roughly \u01eb \u223c 0.04, we also find that flow\nspeeds > 0.06c result in lobe bending by relative velocities consistent with systematic galaxy\nmotion about the cluster center. While the kinetic efficiency is moderately constrained the\nplasma velocity is not. As such, within reasonable limits on the two values, both systematic\ngalaxy motion and merger induced bulk flow of the ICM are possible explanations for the\nshaping of 1159+583.\n\n6.3.\n\nPressure Balance between Radio Lobes and ICM\n\nWhile it is commonly assumed that there should be pressure balance between the ICM\nand radio lobes, G\u00f3mez et al. (1997), using ROSAT and VLA data (O'Donoghue et al. 1990),\nstate the radio source 1159+583 is a dramatic counterexample for the equilibrium between\nthermal ICM pressure and the radio pressure. They find an ICM pressure from the ROSAT\ndata that is significantly lower than the radio equipartition pressure. This striking imbalance\nbetween the ICM pressure and radio pressure is not confirmed by our higher spatial resolution\nChandra observation. This discrepancy is a result of at least two factors within G\u00f3mez et al.\n(1997). These include their lower temperature of 2.6+1.3\n\u22120.70 keV as well as their lower density,\ndetermined from the beta model fit to the surface brightness profile. The average minimum\npressure of the radio lobes assuming equipartition is \u223c 3 x 10\u221212 dyn/cm2 (O'Donoghue et al.\n1993), while the ICM pressure ranges from 5.3 x 10\u221211 dyn cm\u22122 at the cluster center to 3.5 x\n10\u221211 dyn cm\u22122 at the radius of lobe termination. Thus, the lobes depart from the minimum\nenergy condition or there is an additional component within the lobe regions supplying\npressure, such as very hot, diffuse, thermal gas. Similar results have been found previously\nfor radio lobes of FR I sources within clusters [e.g. Morganti et al. (1988); Killeen et al.\n(1988); Feretti et al. (1990, 1992)].\n\n7.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nChandra spectra of Abell 1446 reveal that the intracluster gas is isothermal when averaged over circular annuli to a radius of 400 kpc with relatively smooth profiles of density\nand pressure. The cooling time of the gas is greater than a Hubble time at all locations\nexplaining the absence of an ongoing cooling flow. The cluster exhibits no radial abundance\nvariation and its LX \u2212 T relation appears to fall along the trend derived in Wu et al. (1999).\nThe gas mass to gravitational mass fraction converges to \u223c0.1 at large radii as is seen in the\nmajority of clusters (Allen et al. 2004).\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nWith no significant elliptical elongation of the cluster's large-scale ICM distribution\nand no large discontinuities in the radial profiles of temperature or pressure, it is likely that\nAbell 1446 has not experienced a large cluster-cluster merger in its recent history. Abell\n1446 may be experiencing small-scale mergers with subclumps or galaxy groups resulting in\nthe presence of temperature and pressure substructure along the line that bisects the WAT.\nIf the excess directly to the southeast of the AGN is a wake, it would be expected that this\nmaterial was stripped from its host galaxy by the infalling gas. It is also possible that this\nsoft excess is instead the remnant cool core of the pre-merger cluster or the remnant core of\na group infalling from the north. Additionally, spectroscopically determined redshifts of the\nmember galaxies suggest that some portion of a merger (\u223c 1500 km s\u22121 ) may be occurring\nalong the line-of-sight.\nThe plasma flow speed down the radio lobes of 1159+583 is poorly constrained. As the\ntwo leading explanations for WAT bending are merger induced bulk flow of the ICM and\nsystematic galaxy motion relative to the cluster mean, neither can be ruled out given the\nuncertainties described above. Using our value of \u01eb \u223c 0.04, velocities in the lobes > 0.06c\nare required to bend the radio source without invoking a merger. These flow velocities of\nparticles down the radio lobes are generally higher than the values traditionally assumed but\nconsistent with those used in Hardcastle et al. (2005).\nSupport for this work was provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration through Chandra Award numbers G04-5148X, G05-6126X, and GO5-6137X issued\nby the Chandra X-Ray Center, which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for and on behalf of NASA under contract NAS 8-39073.

The image has been corrected for background and exposure.\nOn larger scales the cluster is approximately circularly symmetric but the inner 100\u2032\u2032 display\nanisotropies in the distribution of the gas.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- SDSS R-band image of Abell 1446 with overlays of X-ray contours of adaptively\nsmoothed emission obtained with Chandra (Figure 1). The contours are logarithmically\nspaced between 0.17 cts arcsec\u22122 and 2.6 cts arcsec\u22122 . The lowest contour is at background(blank sky) + 2\u03c3. The peak in the X-ray emission corresponds with the large elliptical galaxy which is the host of the WAT approximately at the center of the cluster. The 'X'\nmarks the center of the large-scale diffuse emission. The red squares indicate X-ray point\nsources identified using the wavdetect algorithm which are coincident with optical sources in\nthe USNO A2.0 catalog.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Surface brightness profile (0.3-10.0 keV) and single \u03b2-model fit of the ICM.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- A 200 \u00d7 200 kpc region of the cluster center overlaid with 1.4 GHz radio contours\n(A+C configuration VLA archival data) of the wide angle tail radio source 1159+583. The\ncontours shown are 5,10,30,60,100,156, and 223 times the local rms. On close visual inspection it appears that the northern lobe has carved out a cavity within the cluster gas. An\nexcess of emission is seen between the lobes.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- An image of excess X-ray emission created by subtracting an isophotal model from\na 4\u2032\u2032 Gaussian smoothed image of the cluster. The model was weighted by 0.7 to avoid over\nsubtraction. Radio contours are the same as in Fig. 4.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Profiles of temperature and chemical abundance. Both profiles show no strong\ndependence on radius.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Temperature map of the cluster center with contours of the smoothed Chandra\nemission (white) and 1.4 GHz radio emission (black) superposed. A region of significantly\nhotter gas can be seen to the southeast of the AGN along the line that bisects the WAT. In\naddition, the excess of emission to the north seen in Fig. 5 may be identified as the cooler\nregion directly north of the cluster center.\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- LX \u2212 T relation plot from Wu et al. (1999). Abell 1446 is denoted by the diamond.\nThe relation appears to fall roughly along the trend.\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Profiles of electron number density, pressure, and cooling time. There is no\nevidence for a sharp change in pressure from a significant shock as would be associated with\na large-scale cluster merger.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Profiles of gas (circles) and gravitational (squares) mass. As the radius increases,\nthe gas mass fraction converges towards 0.1 as is seen in other galaxy clusters.\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- Pressure map of the cluster center with contours of the smoothed Chandra emission (white) and 1.4 GHz radio emission (black) superposed. Pressure substructure can be\nseen along the line that bisects the WAT. A region of high pressure is coincident with the\nsouthern radio lobe.\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- Soft [E = 0.3-1.0 keV](left) and hard [E = 1.0-10.0 keV](right) images of the\ncentral region of Abell 1446. The wake candidate can be identified in the soft image as the\nexcess emission to the southeast of the AGN.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- left: Velocity distribution of 50 cluster members of A1446 with spectroscopically\ndetermined redshifts from SDSS. A secondary velocity peak is offset from the central distribution by \u223c 1500 km s\u22121 . right: Distribution on the sky of the cluster members with\nSDSS redshifts. The data is divided into two samples defined by the velocity separation of\nthe primary and secondary populations. Lower velocity galaxies with v = 28000 - 30000 km\ns\u22121 are shown as triangles while those with higher velocites v = 30000 - 32000 km s\u22122 are\nshown as circles. A majority of the lower velocity galaxies (9/10) occupy a specific region\nof the sky along the line that bisects the WAT. Such velocity data may be an indication of\nsome portion of a cluster merger occurring along the line-of-sight with a radial velocity of \u223c\n1500 km s\u22121 . The contours are the same as those in Fig. 2.\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.- Spectral index map of 1159+583 obtained from 1.4 GHz and 4.8 GHz VLA data.\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\n\nFig. 15.- Radial profile of the spectral index of the southern lobe of 1159+583 obtained\nfrom 1.4 GHz and 4.8 GHz VLA data.\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\n\nFig. 16.- Plasma flow speed down the lobes versus kinetic efficiency. The diagonal line\nrepresents the combinations of plasma flow speed and kinetic efficiency required to bend the\nlobes into their observed shape given a galaxy velocity of 300 km s\u22121 (the upper limit for\nsystematic galaxy motion about the cluster center). Combinations that fall below this line\nrequire galaxy velocities greater than 300 km s\u22121 , while those that lie above allow velocities\nless than 300 km s\u22121 . The dotted line corresponds to our calculated kinetic efficiency (\u01eb \u223c\n0.04).\n\n\f"}
