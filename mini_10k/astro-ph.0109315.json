We assess the extent to which the flux-limited PSCz redshift sample is capable\nof accounting for the major share of mass concentrations inducing the external tidal forces\naffecting the peculiar velocities within the Local Supercluster (LS). The investigation is based\nupon a comparison of the \"true\" velocities in 2 large N-body simulations and their reconstruction\nfrom \"observation-mimicking\" mock catalogues. The mildly nonlinear \"mock\" LS and PSCz\nvelocities are analyzed by means of the Least Action Principle technique in its highly optimized\nimplementation of Nusser & Branchini's Fast Action Method (FAM). For both model N-body\nUniverses, we conclude that the dipolar and quadrupolar force field implied by the PSCz galaxy\ndistribution would indeed be sufficiently representing the full external tidal force field1 .\n\nFigure 1: Left: The analyzed \"mock\" Local Supercluster + PSCz galaxy distribution, with the sample of \"mock\" measured Local Supercluster peculiar velocities.

Within\nthe gravitational instability scenario of structure formation, the displacements are the result of the\ncumulative gravitational force exerted by the continuously growing density surpluses and deficits\nthroughout the Universe. This establishes a direct causal link between gravitational force and the\ncorresponding peculiar velocities.\nGiven a suitably accurate measurement of peculiar velocities within a well-defined \"internal\" region\nof space, Vint , we may invert these velocities, relate them to the gravitational force and whence trace\nand possibly even reconstruct the source of the measured motions. The gravitational force g(x),\ng(x) = gint (x) + gext (x) = gint (x) + gD + Qg * x + . . .\n(1)\nis the netto sum of the individual contributions from each cosmic location. We decompose the total\nintegrated gravity g(x) into an internal component gint , representing the integrated contribution from\nthe density fluctuations within Vint , and the externally induced gravitational force gext , generated by\nthe fluctuations outside Vint . Often details of the external matter distribution are not relevant for the\ndynamics in some local region, so that sizable external force contributions are usually restricted to the\n1\n\na complete version of this work is reported in Romano-D\u0131\u0301az, E., Branchini, E., van de Weygaert, R., 2001, MNRAS.,\nsubmitted\n\n\fdipole and quadrupole components in gext , gD responsible for its \"bulk\" motion and gQ (x) = Qg * x,\nagent of the shear in the flow field. In principle involving the complete visible Universe, we expect\nsignificant contributions to be limited to some finite volume whose typical scale will be that of the\nlargest cosmic structures. Although not exactly known, its size may amount to \u2248 100 \u2212 200h\u22121 Mpc.\n\n2\n\nExternal influences in the Local Supercluster: a \"mock\" experiment\n\nWe investigate the question of whether it is feasible to trace the distant sources that have a noticeable\ninfluence on the dynamics in our local Universe. Concretely, we focus our attention on the Local\nSupercluster, and address the issue whether we can infer the extent and configuration of the external\ngravitational forces influencing its dynamics and evolution. In addition, we then to seek to assess\nwhether such a study provides sufficient information to identify the responsible structures and objects\nfrom the present generation (or shortly available) galaxy redshift samples. To assess whether a genuine observational study may yield conclusive evidence, we follow the approach of studying idealized\nmodel circumstances. Conclusions are obtained from a comparison of the full model circumstances\nwith the predicted results from specially selected subsamples, moulded such that they resemble the\nobservational circumstances. For our model Universes we take two large N-body simulations, one of a\n\u039bCDM structure formation scenario, the other of a \u03c4 CDM scenario (Cole etal. 1998).\nWithin each model, we first identify 10 \"mock\" Local Superclusters, volume limited samples of\ngalaxies in a spherical volume of 30h\u22121 Mpc radius resembling the Nearby Galaxy Catalogue (NBG).\nWith these galaxy distributions at our disposal, we determine the galaxy velocities that would result\nwhen gravity would be solely the result of the internal mass distribution, i.e. assuming a perfectly\nhomogeneous external mass distribution. The deviations of the predicted velocity field from the full\nvelocities (here: the N-body models) must then be ascribed to external forces. In a second step we\nthen try to evaluate where the most influential external sources may be located. To this end, we\nuse the PSCz galaxy redshift survey as the template for our investigation of the dynamically relevant\nexternal Universe. For the purposes of covering uniformly all possible relevant matter concentrations,\nthe 15,500 galaxies contained in this survey constitute an ideal sample. It is based on an objectively\ndefined IRAS flux selection, forms a near perfect uniform flux-limited selection, has an excellent 84%\nsky coverage, and probes to a useful depth, \u223c 200h\u22121 Mpc. On the basis of its selection criteria we\nalso identify, along with the LS \"mock\" samples, 10 PSCz \"mock\" PSCz galaxy samples. The lefthand\nframe of figure 1 depicts one specimen of our \"mock\" samples, showing the total LS+PSCz \"galaxy\"\nsample and zooming in onto the \"LS region\", of which also the velocities are shown.\nThe Local Supercluster is a mildly nonlinear cosmic structure. Instead of using simple linear dynamics or the Zel'dovich approximation we therefore invoke the gravitational Least Action Principle\n(LAP, Peebles 1989) for properly (re)tracing the galaxy orbits. However, the initial LAP implementation, suited for small galaxy groups, is not adequate for our situation. The \"mock\" LS and PSCz\ngalaxy samples involves so many objects that the calculation would be rendered impracticable. Possibly even more fundamental is its inability to deal well with a flux-limited sample like the PSCz one. Of\nkey importance therefore is the use of the Fast Action Minimization (FAM) optimization developed by\nNusser & Branchini (2000). Involving numerical, force evaluation and base function optimizations at\nvarious stages of the LAP technique, it allowed the large \"mock\" sample computations in our analysis.\nThe results are highly encouraging. The righthand frame of figure 1 shows (topleft) the FAM velocity field prediction for the LS restricted sample. Statistical analysis proved its incompatibility with\nthe full velocity field. But when the PSCz sample is invoked significant differences vanish. Moreover,\nwhen restricting ourselves to the corresponding dipole and quadrupole contributions, evaluations on\nthe basis of point-to-point velocity comparisons (see insert in large righthand frame) prove these to\nrepresent virtually the complete external contribution.\n\n3\n\nConclusions: \"what's in a game\"\n\nThe FAM computations restrict themselves to the matter concentrations within the realm of the\nPSCz selections and prove that the implied velocities correspond extremely well with the full \"model\"\nvelocities. In other words, the PSCz selections appear to comprise the source of the non-internally\ninduced motions. Hence, when we would live either in a \u039bCDM or \u03c4 CDM Universe, and if the PSCz\ngalaxies faithfully trace the underlying mass distribution, we may plausibly argue the sample to contain\nall locally relevant density concentrations. Moreover, almost all relevant contributions can be ascribed\nto the dipolar and quadrupolar anisotropy in the PSCz mass distribution.\n\n\f"}
