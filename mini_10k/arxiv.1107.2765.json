Dw, 74.25. nj, 76.60. -k\n\nTo date, a variety of iron-based pnictides have been\ndiscovered since the discovery of superconductivity in\nLaFeAsO1\u2212x Fx (La 1111 series).1 Among these compounds, the 1111 series (RFeAsO1\u2212x Fx R=Ce, Pr, Sm,\netc. ) and the 122 series [Ba(Fe1\u2212x Cox )2 As2 ] have been\nextensively studied because the highest superconducting\ntransition temperature (Tc ) has been marked in the former family2,3 and a large single crystal is available for\nthe latter. The main difference between them is the distance between FeAs planes: The 0.8739 nm distance of\nthe La 1111 series is greater than the 0.65 nm distance\nof the Ba 122 series.1,4,5 Despite this \u223c0.22 nm difference, their electronic phase diagrams completely differ\nfrom each other. For the 1111 series, an overlap of the\nstripe-type antiferromagnetic (AF) and superconducting\n(SC) phases is absent and the optimal Tc is realized away\nfrom the phase boundary, while for the 122 series, the\ntwo phases overlap and the optimal Tc is realized at the\nphase boundary.1\u22123,6\u22128 The difference gives an impression that the two families are entirely different. However,\nCaFe1\u2212x Cox AsF (Ca1111 series)9 having an intermediate distance of 0.8593 nm was recently found to have\nan intermediate overlap,10 suggesting that the phase diagrams show continuous variation depending on the distance between FeAs planes. The shrinkage of the distance\nincreases the overlap, although the optimal Tc remains\napproximately the same among these compounds.\nThe question is what occurs in compounds having\na large distance between FeAs planes. Actually, pnictides with perovskite-type blocking layers have a large\ndistance of 1.3 \u2212 2.5 nm.11 A high Tc \u223c40 K is\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor: naoki@fujiwara.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp\n\nmarked in these compounds. The highest Tc in this\nfamily has been marked at 47 K for a titanium oxide (Fe2 As2 )(Ca4 (Mg, Ti)3 Oy ).12 For other compounds,\nsuch as (Fe2 As2 )(Ca5 (Sc, Ti)4 Oy ) and (Fe2 As2 )(Ca6 (Sc,\nTi)5 Oy ), Tc exceeds 40 K.11 In (Fe2 As2 )(Sr4 (Mg, Ti)2 O6 )\nand (Fe2 As2 )(Sr4 V2 O6 ), Tc reaches 35 and 37 K,\nrespectively.13,14 This family is characterized by small\nlattice constants, a narrow As-Fe-As bonding angle,\nand a large distance between FeAs planes, which cause\nthe lack of the hole pocket corresponding to the \u03b1\nFermi surface in undoped systems as theoretically investigated in (Fe2 As2 )(Ca4 Al2 O6 ).15,16 Compounds such as\n(Fe2 As2 )(Ca4 Al2 O6 ) and (Fe2 As2 )(Sr4 Sc2 O6 ) are under\nthe existing paradigm in the meaning that the blocking\nlayers are insulators like other iron-based pnictides;15\u221217\nhowever Ti doping would induce new Fermi surfaces of\nTi-orbital origin.18 In (Fe2 As2 )(Sr4 V2 O6 ), the hybridization between V and Fe orbitals is possible, but strong\ncorrelations in V orbitals result in Mott-Hubbard-type\ninsulating blocking layers.19,20 The insulating blocking\nlayers with localized magnetic moments has been suggested from the experiments using several techniques.21\nFor this family, the focus is on whether transition\nmetals in blocking layers are involved in the formation of Fermi surfaces. An understanding would shed\nnew light on the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity and high-Tc mechanisms. We focus on\n(Fe2 As2 )(Ca6 (Al, Ti)4 Oy ) (y \u223c 12) with four (Al, Ti)O\nlayers intercalated between FeAs planes, as shown in\nFig. 1(a).22 The series boasts of a 2.2 nm distance between FeAs planes. Isomorphic compounds with two and\nthree (Al, Ti)O layers, (Fe2 As2 )(Can+2 (Al, Ti)n Oy ) (n\n= 2, 3) have also been synthesized; however, they are\nof an inferior quality than the four-layered samples.22\nThe present compound is suitable for nuclear magnetic\n\n\f2\n\nc\na\n\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40 60\nT (K)\n\n80\n\n(c)\n\nNMR Intensity (arb.units)\n\n!\"!m !cm )\n\n15\n\n0.0\n\n58 60 62 64 66\n\n(b)\n\n50K\n30K\n20K\n10K\n6.5K\n4.2K\n2.66K\n1.68K\n\nH (kOe)\n\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0 kOe\n20.8 kOe\n\n0.5\n0.6\n0\n\n60K\n30K\n20K\n10K\n4.2K\n\n(a)\n\n0.1\n\n20\n\n40\nT (K)\n\n60\n\nFIG. 1:\n(Color online) (a) Crystal structure of\n(Fe2 As2 )(Ca6 (Al, Ti)4 Oy ) [22].\n(b) Temperature dependence of the resistivity.

At this field, 27 Al-1/T1 T measurements were\ncurried out, as shown in Fig. 3(d).\n\nresonance (NMR) measurements because 75 As(I = 32 )\nand 27 Al(I = 25 ) NMR can provide information about\nboth FeAs and (Al, Ti)O layers on a microscopic level.\nWe measured NMR using a conventional pulsed NMR\nmethod for powder samples. The chemical formula expected from the crystal structure is (Fe2 As2 )(Ca6 (Al0.5\nTi0.5 )4 O12 ) in which Ti is formally nonmagnetic and\ntherefore nonmagnetic blocking layers are expected.22 A\nsuperstructure corresponding to some Al ordering was\nnot observed from the x-ray analysis, implying that Al\nor Ti ions are randomly distributed in the blocking layers.\nThe samples contained FeAs impurities, but the concentration was less than 2% in weight. The impurity phase\nwas not observable in the 75 As NMR measurements: it is\nknown that FeAs exhibits a magnetic ordering at 70 K,23\nbut we could not find any anomaly around 70 K in the\n75\nAs NMR measurements. Figure 1(b) shows the resistivity: The onset of Tc is estimated to be 39 K and zero\nresistivity is at approximately 30 K, which is approximately the same as Tc determined from the detuning of\nan NMR tank circuit at 36.8 MHz, as shown in Fig. 1(c).\nFigures 2(a) and 2(b) show field-swept 75 As and 27 Al\nNMR spectra, respectively, measured from spin-echo intensity at 45.1 MHz. The 75 As NMR spectra for the\ncentral transition (I = -1/2 \u21d4 1/2 ) broaden because of\nthe second-order quadrupole effect similar to other ironbased pnictides.

(c) The linewidth of 27 Al NMR spectra.\nThe ordering temperature is 7 K.\n\nent electric field gradients (EFGs). In this case, however,\nthe intensity difference between two 75 As sites is not explained. Instead, the lineshape is well reproduced by considering a large anisotropic coefficient (\u03b7) of EFG. The\npure quadrupole frequency (\u03bdQ ) and \u03b7 are estimated to\nbe \u03bdQ = 13.4 MHz and \u03b7 \u223c 0.6, respectively. The large\n\u03b7 value is rare in iron-based pnictides, although a fairly\nlarge \u03b7(\u223c 0.3 ) has been reported in CaFe1\u2212x Cox AsF.10\nTwo bumps around 61 and 63 kOe correspond to \u03b8 =\n90\u25e6 and 42\u25e6 , respectively, where \u03b8 represents the angle\nbetween the c axis and the applied field. The lineshape\nchanges at low temperatures reflecting some spin ordering. However, the position of the low-field bump is unchanged even in the ordered state, implying that the ordered moments are aligned parallel to FeAs planes like\nother pnictides: For the samples associated with the lowfield bump, the stripe-type ordered moments result in the\ninternal field perpendicular to the applied field, and have\nno affect on the low-field bump. The appearance of some\nordering is clearly visible from the 27 Al NMR spectra.\nAlthough satellite signals (I = \u00b1 32 \u21d4 \u00b1 25 ) are expected\nto appear because of the quadrupole effect, only a sharp\nsignal is observable at high temperatures, implying that\nAl nuclei experience an EFG that is very small and is\nsomewhat distributed. The sharp signal also indicates\nthat the local environment around 27 Al is hardly affected\nby random Al distribution. The sharp signal changes to\na rectangular-type powder pattern at low temperatures.\nThe ordering temperature (TN ) is estimated to be 7 \u2212 8\n\n\f3\n\nm (t)\n\n1\n(a) 40K\n0.1\n0.01\n0\n\n10\n\n(d)\n\n100\n\n-3\n\n20\n\n30 40x10\n\nt (s)\n\nAs\n1/T1 (s )\n\n(b) 22K\n\n-1\n\nm (t)\n\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n10\n\n2.0\n\nAl\n\n-1\n\n1/T1s (s )\n\nt (s)\n1\n\n1000\n\n(c)\n\n100\n10\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6 8\n\n2\n\n4\n\n10\n\n6 8\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0.1\n\n2\n\n100\n\n4\n\n6 8\n\n2\n\n4\n\n10\n\nT (K)\n\n6 8\n\n2\n\n4\n\n100\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) (a) Recovery curve, m(t) = 1 \u2212 M (t)/M (\u221e) of 75 As.

(d)\nTemperature dependence of 1/T1 for 75 As and 27 Al.\n\nK from the temperature (T ) dependence of the linewidth,\nas shown in Fig. 2(c). The tail of the rectangular pattern on both sides is caused by the effect of small satellite\nsignals. The rectangular-type powder pattern is symmetric with regard to the free position corresponding to the\nLarmor frequency, demonstrating that an AF spin configuration is formed and the amplitude of spin moments\nis spatially uniform.\nRelaxation rates (1/T1 ) of 75 As and 27 Al were measured using a saturation-recovery method. We measured\n1/T1 T of 75 As ( (1/T1 T )As ) at the lower-field bump and\n1/T1 T of 27 Al ( (1/T1 T )Al ) at a low field of 20.8 kOe\nbecause a large field could potentially break down the superconductivity or reduce the SC volume fraction. Prior\nto the measurements, we confirmed whether the superconductivity is maintained at 20.8 kOe from the detuning\n[Fig. 1(c)]. At this field, Tc is estimated to be 23 \u00b15 K.\nThe decrease in Tc was also confirmed from the AC and\nDC susceptibility.24 A remarkable decrease in Tc under\na low field may be a peculiarity of this system. Such\ncaution is not required for 75 As, because FeAs planes at\nthe low-field bump are parallel to the applied field, and\nthe decrease in Tc under the field is neglected. Figures\n3(a) and 3(b) show recovery curves, time variations of\nspin-echo intensity after a saturation pulse, for 75 As and\n27\nAl, respectively. Data of 75 As follow the conventional\nrate equation for the central transition (I = -1/2 \u21d4 1/2\n),\n1\u2212\n\nM (t)\n= 0.9exp(\u22126t/T1) + 0.1exp(\u2212t/T1 ),\nM (\u221e)\n\n(1)\n\nwhile all 27 Al satellite signals are saturated owing to the\nsmall quadrupole splitting, and data of 27 Al exhibit a\nrecovery with two components,\n1\u2212\n\nM (t)\n= (1 \u2212 c)exp(\u2212t/T1s ) + cexp(\u2212t/T1 ).

The value of c increases approximately linearly from 0.4 to 0.6 with increasing temperature. The fast-recovery component 1/T1s hardly reflects\nthe electronic state, and possibly originates from the nuclear spin diffusion. Bending points in Fig. 3(d) are in\ngood agreement with Tc determined from the detuning\nin Fig. 1(c). 1/T1 values of 75 As are one order greater\nthan those of 27 Al, while the T dependence, excluding Tc\nvalues, of both nuclei is very similar. The T dependence\nof (1/T1 T )As and (1/T1 T )Al normalized by the values at\nTc is shown in Fig. 4(a). They both show Curie-Weiss\nbehavior and are almost the same at high temperatures\nabove Tc , implying that both nuclei experience the same\nspin fluctuation.\nInterestingly, Curie-Weiss behavior returns in 1/T1 T\nat low temperatures, reflecting the AF ordering. The\nquestion is which of Ti and Fe is responsible for the AF\nordering. In the existing paradigm, the blocking layers\nare insulators and the AF ordering would occur either\nin FeAs or (Al, Ti)O layers. In both cases, some of the\nresults are not well explained.\n(1)In the case of Fe origin, Fe orbitals are responsible for both SC and AF orderings, which would be very\n\n\f4\n\n3\n2\n\n1\n6\n5\n4\n\n-1\n\n(T1T) /(T1T)\n\n-1\nTc\n\n(a)\n\n3\n\nAs\nAl\n\n2\n\n0.1\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n-1\n\n(T1T)As / (T1T)Al\n\n-1\n\nT/Tc\n100\n10\n\n(b)\n1\n\n4 5 6\n\n2\n\n3 4 5 6\n\n10\n\n2\n\n100\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online)(a) Plot of 1/T1 T versus T normalized by those at Tc .

The possibility is ruled out because\ntwo inner (Al, Ti)O layers are away from FeAs planes\nand only weak dipole coupling is effective as hyperfine\ncoupling, making the linewidth narrow and the spectral\nweight strong at the central position of the 27 Al lineshape. The linewidth of 27 Al in the inner (Al, Ti)O layers is estimated as \u223c5 Oe when a Bohr magnetron is\nassumed as the amplitude of Fe moments.\n(2) In the case of localized Ti moments, the appearance of the spatially uniform AF spin moments results\nin a 3d1 state having an electron at each Ti site, despite that Ti ions are expected to be nonmagnetic from\nthe crystal structure. Such case may be possible when\nelectrons are transferred from FeAs planes to (Al, Ti)O\nlayers. If all Ti ions were magnetic, Al nuclei would experience strong low-frequency fluctuation, considering the\nlocation of Al nuclei. This is seen in other compounds\nsuch as SmFeAsO1\u2212x Fx and NdFeAsO1\u2212x Fx : Predominant spin fluctuation, namely Curie-Weiss behavior in\n1/T1 , masks information from FeAs planes.25,26 On the\ncontrary, 1/T1 is almost constant at 27 Al, and Tc is observable at high temperatures in the present compound.\nExperimental results are not perfectly explained by the\n\nexisting paradigm. The reason why (Al, Ti)O layers are\nnot insulators is derived directly from the amplitude of\nthe ordered moments < Si >. The amplitude is estimated from the hyperfine coupling 27 Ahf and internal\nfield \u2206H of 27 Al as \u2206H = g\u03bcB < Si >27 Ahf . The\ncoupling 27 Ahf mainly originates from the Fermi contact rather than the super-transferred hyperfine coupling.\nBecause the coupling is rather isotropic, all fluctuations\nare observable at 27 Al sites, but in-plane AF fluctuations\nwould be predominant as investigated in the 122 series.27\nIn the case of 75 As, the hyperfine coupling 75 Ahf mainly\noriginates from the transferred hyperfine coupling. As\nnuclei experience the in-plane AF fluctuations remarkably when the field is applied parallel to FeAs planes.27\nTherefore, the in-plane AF fluctuations would be predominant at both 27 Al and 75 As sites. The coupling\n27\nAhf can be estimated by the following relation assuming that both 27 Al and 75 As experience the same AF\nfluctuation:\n\n75\n75\n1\n1\n\u03b3N\nAhf 2\n/\n\u223c ( 27 )2 ( 27\n) .\n(T1 )As (T1 )Al\n\u03b3N\nAhf\n\n(3)\n\n\f5\nThe value is approximately 30 at high temperatures, as\nseen in Fig. 4(b). The gyromagnetic ratios of 75 As and\n27\nAl, 75 \u03b3N and 27 \u03b3N are 7.29 and 11.09 MHz/10 kOe,\nrespectively. The coupling 75 Ahf has been estimated to\nbe 26 kOe/\u03bcB for the field parallel to the FeAs planes,27\nand 27 Ahf is estimated to be 3.1 kOe/\u03bcB from Eq. (3).\nThe internal field \u2206H is \u223c 0.3 \u2212 0.4 kOe as seen in Fig.\n2(b), therefore < Si > is estimated to be \u223c 0.05 \u2212 0.07.\nThe value is very small compared with that expected\nfrom localized spin moments < Si >= 1/2. The small AF\nmagnetization is a feature of weakly antiferromagnetic\nmetals. To explain the small amplitude of < Si > and\nthe similarity between 75 As and 27 Al sites in 1/T1T [Fig.\n4(b)],28 some hybridization between Ti and Fe orbitals\nwould be crucial.\nFor (Fe2 As2 )(Sr4 V2 O6 ) with a high TN of 150 K,29 V\norbitals should be removed from the Fermi level owing to\nstrong correlations of d orbitals in vanadium; namely a\nMott-Hubbard-type insulating state is realized. Taking\naccount of a small TN ( \u223c 7 K) caused by Al-rich doping,\ncorrelations are expected to be small, and therefore, (Al,\nTi)O layers are responsible for Fermi surfaces, contrary\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\nY.

The appearance of the AF\nstate following the SC state implies that some parts of\nthe Fermi surfaces are not involved in the formation of a\nSC gap. In this sense, the phenomenon is similar to homogeneous coexistence of the incommensurate spin density wave and superconductivity in the crossover regime\nof the 122 or 1111 series.30\u221232,10\nIn summary, an unusual successive phase transition\nfrom the SC to AF phases was observed via 1/T1 T . Although the spatially uniform AF ordering is clearly visible from 27 Al spectra, localized spin moments are unlikely to exist in (Al, Ti)O blocking layers. The ordered\nmoments are very small, and the T dependence of 1/T1 T\nat both 75 As and 27 Al sites is very similar throughout\nthe entire temperature range. These facts suggest that\nsome hybridization between Ti and Fe orbitals induces a\nuniform electronic state within FeAs and (Al, Ti)O layers\naccompanied by the SC and weak AF transitions.\nThe authors would like to thank K.
