The three-brane is found using a construction of Maldacena,\nMoore, and Seiberg. We show that all these branes satisfy Cardy's condition\nand extract the open string spectrum on them.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nPerturbative string theory on AdS3 , which is isomorphic to the SL(2, IR) group manifold, is considerably more complicated than string theory on compact group manifolds. (For previous work on SL(2, IR), see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].) Some of the\nsubtleties of the closed string spectrum were worked out in [9], where a proposal for\nthe closed string spectrum was proposed, and checked by an explicit computation of\nthe partition function.\nThere has also been work on D-branes and open strings in AdS3 . Semiclassical\ndescriptions of D-branes were given in [10, 11, 12], and the direct quantization of the\nopen strings on the branes was performed in [13]. The boundary state description of\nthe D-branes was found in [14].\nIn this paper, we will extend the results of [14] to describe boundary states for\nother branes on AdS3 and Euclidean AdS3 . (Semiclassical descriptions of some of\nthese branes had been given in [10, 11, 12]). We verify that Cardy's condition is\nsatisfied and use this to extract the spectrum of open strings connecting various\nbranes.\nThe interesting aspect in these calculations is that the infinite volume of AdS3\nmakes quantities like the overlaps of branes infinite. As we shall see (and was already\nshown in [14]) all these divergences can be tamed by a careful regularization of the\nvolume.\n\u2217\n\narvindra@muon.rutgers.edu\n\n1\n\n\fWe start by reviewing the closed string spectrum of [9]. Then we review the Dbrane spectrum on Euclidean AdS3 , which is a straightforward extension of [10, 11,\n12]. We find a whole zoo of objects, which fall into three classes. The boundary states\nfor these branes can be written down, following the methods of [14], and the overlaps\ncan be computed.\nIt turns out that one of these three classes actually fails to satisfy Cardy's condition. The remaining two classes of objects (which we call 1-branes and 2-instantons)\nsatisfy Cardy's condition and hence are physical states in the theory.\nWe then investigate a new class of branes (which we call parafermionic branes)which\nwere not discussed by [10, 11, 12]. These new branes are the extension to SL(2, IR)\nof branes found in SU(2) by [15]. This yields one new brane that satisfies Cardy's\ncondition and appears to be a three-brane wrapping the entire AdS3 .\nWe close with a summary of our results.\nRecently, the paper [16] appeared with related results.\n\n2\n\nReview of closed strings on AdS3\n\nIn cylindrical (global) coordinates, the metric of AdS3 is\nds2 = \u2212 cosh2 \u03c1 dt2 + d\u03c12 + sinh2 \u03c1 d\u03c62\n\n(1)\n\nAll modes of particles propagating in AdS3 should fall into representations of the\nisometry group, namely SL(2, IR)L \u00d7SL(2, IR)R . Explicit expressions for the generators\nof SL(2, IR)L \u00d7 SL(2, IR)R are [17]\ni\n\u2202u\n2\n\"\n#\ni \u22122iu\n1\n=\ncoth 2\u03c1\u2202u \u2212\ne\n\u2202v + i\u2202\u03c1\n2\nsinh 2\u03c1\n\"\n#\n1\ni 2iu\ncoth 2\u03c1\u2202u \u2212\ne\n\u2202v \u2212 i\u2202\u03c1\n=\n2\nsinh 2\u03c1\n\nJ3 =\nJ+\nJ\u2212\n\n(2)\n\nwhere u = 12 (t + \u03c6), v = 21 (t \u2212 \u03c6). The generators of the other SL(2, IR) algebra are\nobtained by exchanging u and v in the above expressions.\nThe Laplacian on Lorentzian AdS3 is given by\n\u2737 = \u2202\u03c12 + 2\n\n1\n1\ncosh 2\u03c1\n2\n\u2202\u03c1 +\n\u22022\n2 \u2202\u03c6 \u2212\nsinh 2\u03c1\nsinh \u03c1\ncosh2 \u03c1 t\n\n(3)\n\nThe Laplacian on Euclidean AdS3 is obtained by replacing t = i\u03c4 .\nWe will consider (delta function) normalizable states in Euclidean AdS3 . This\nforces the eigenvalues of the Laplacian to be of the form 4j(j \u2212 1) with j = 1+is\n(s\n2\nreal). These are the continuous representations of the covering group SL(2, C).\nThese do not have highest or lowest weight states, and therefore the spectrum of\n3\nJ in this representation is unbounded from above and from below. This leads to a\ndivergence in the characters of these representations.\n2\n\n\fFor each representation of the zero mode algebra SL(2, IR) \u00d7 SL(2, IR) one can\nconstruct a module of the Kac-Moody algebra by a repeated application of oscillator\na\nmodes J\u2212n\n, n > 0, a = \u00b1, 3. We denote such representations by D\u0302j\u00b1 and \u0108j\u03b1 . These\nrepresentations were dubbed positive energy representations in [9], as the spectrum\nof L0 is bounded from below.\nIn [18, 9], a new set of representations of the KM algebra was constructed. These\nare obtained from the above representations by an application of the spectral flow,\ndefined as :\nk\n+\n\u2212\nJn3 \u2192 Jn3 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b4n,0 Jn+ \u2192 Jn+\u03c9\nJn\u2212 \u2192 Jn\u2212\u03c9\n(4)\n2\nThis preserves the KM algebra, and was conjectured in [9] to be a symmetry of\nthe closed string spectrum. The new representations have L0 unbounded from below,\nbut satisfy a no-ghost theorem, proven in [9]. The complete closed string spectrum\nthen consists of the representations allowed by the no-ghost theorem above, together\nwith all their images under the spectral flow-the so-called flowed representations.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nThe brane zoo\nClassical descriptions\n\nWe now review the D-brane spectrum found in [10, 11, 12]. Following [19], we shall\nlook for D-branes wrapping regular and twined conjugacy classes.\nWe will use the following quantities, defined in terms of Euclidean cylindrical\ncoordinates (see the Appendix)\nsinh \u03c8 \u2261 sinh \u03c1 sin \u03c6\nsinh \u03b1 \u2261 cosh \u03c1 sinh \u03c4\ncosh \u03bb \u2261 cosh \u03c1 cosh \u03c4\n3.1.1\n\n(5)\n\n1-branes\n\nOne set of conjugacy classes in Lorentzian AdS3 is described by the equation [12]\nsinh \u03c8 = constant \u2261 sinh \u03c80\n\n(6)\n\nA brane wrapped on this hypersurface is extended along the time direction and hence\ndescribes a D1-brane in Lorentzian AdS3 .\nIn Euclidean AdS3 , the conjugacy class is described by the same equation, and is\na hypersurface in Euclidean AdS3 .\nIn Poincare coordinates on Euclidean AdS3 , the corresponding equation for the\nconjugacy class is\nx\n= constant\nr\n\n3\n\n(7)\n\n\f3.1.2\n\n2-instantons\n\nA second set of conjugacy classes in Lorentzian AdS3 is described by the equation\ncosh \u03c1 sin t = constant. A brane wrapped on this hypersurface is not extended along\nthe time direction and hence describes an instantonic D2-brane in Lorentzian AdS3 .\nIn Euclidean AdS3 , the conjugacy class is described by the equation\nsinh \u03b1 = constant \u2261 sinh \u03b10\n\n(8)\n\nIn Poincare coordinates in Euclidean AdS3 , the corresponding equation for the\nconjugacy class is\n\u03c4\u0303\n= constant\n(9)\nr\nThis shows the similarity between the 2-instanton and the 1-brane above.\nEquation (8) can be understood as being related to equation (6) by the replacement \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1 + i\u03c02 , (\u03c4 + \u03c6) \u2192 (\u03c4 + \u03c6), (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2192 \u2212(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c6), which leaves Euclidean AdS3\ninvariant. This is an inner automorphism of the covering group SL(2, C).\n3.1.3\n\n0-instantons\n\nThe Lorentzian AdS3 conjugacy class cosh \u03c1 sin t = constant can be translated to the\nconjugacy class cosh \u03c1 cos t = constant by a shift t \u2192 t+ \u03c02 , which is an inner automorphism of SL(2, IR). This new equation has a different continuation to Euclidean AdS3 ,\ni.e.\ncosh \u03bb = constant \u2261 cosh \u03bb0\n\n(10)\n\nA brane wrapped on this hypersurface is also instantonic. In particular, the case\n\u03bb0 = 0 describes a pointlike object at \u03c1 = 0, \u03c4 = 0. (This is, as we shall see, not\nthe usual D-instanton.) The more general case \u03bb0 > 0 describes a hypersurface in\nEuclidean AdS3 surrounding the point \u03c1 = 0, \u03c4 = 0.\nAs we shall see, these branes do not satisfy Cardy's condition, and therefore do\nnot correspond to physical objects.\nThese conjugacy classes are related to the ones in the previous subsection by the\nshift \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 i\u03c02 , which is an inner automorphism of the covering group SL(2, C).\n3.1.4\n\nCircular branes\n\nMore generally, the Lorentzian AdS3 conjugacy class\ncosh \u03c1 (sin t cos t0 + cos t sin t0 ) = constant\n\n(11)\n\ncontinues in Euclidean AdS3 to cosh \u03c1(i sinh \u03c4 cos t0 + cosh \u03c4 sin t0 ) = constant which\nis actually two equations\ncosh \u03c1 sinh \u03c4 = C1\n\ncosh \u03c1 cosh \u03c4 = C2\n\n(12)\n\nThis describes a circle centered at \u03c1 = 0, at some fixed value of \u03c4 .\nAs we shall see, none of these conjugacy classes lead to boundary states satisfying\nCardy's condition unless sin t0 = 0, which reduces to the previous cases.\n4\n\n\f3.2\n3.2.1\n\nBoundary states\n1-branes\n\nThe boundary state for the 1-brane was found in [14]. We review this construction\nhere.\nFirstly, the boundary state |B 1D i for the 1-brane satisfies (J a + J \u0304a )|B 1D i = 0. For\nexample, the zero-mode equation (J 3 + J \u03043 )|B 1D i = 0 translates to \u2202t |B 1D i = 0 i.e.\nthe brane is extended along the time direction. The other components work similarly,\nas shown in [14].\nThe solution for the Ishibashi states satisfying\na\n(Jna + J \u0304\u2212n\n)|Ii = 0\n\n(13)\n\nwas found in [20]. Suppose we are given a KM primary |\u03a6j i in the \u0108j\u03b1 \u00d7 \u0108j\u03b1 representation. By that we mean a state which is annihilated by all lowering operators Jna , n > 0,\nbut not by the zero modes (since Cj\u03b1 has no highest weight states). Define[21, 22]\n|I j i =\n\nX\nI,J\n\n\u22121\nMIJ\nJ\u2212I J \u0304\u2212J |\u03a6j i\n\n(14)\n\nHere I, J are ordered strings of indices (n1 , a1 ) * * * (nr , ar ), and\nJI = Jna11 * * * Jnarr .\n\n(15)\n\nFor later convenience we choose an ordering such that all zero modes act from the\nleft.

(For degenerate modules, one has to mod\nout by the null vectors). It is easy to see that |I j i satisfies (13) by showing that\n(Jn + J \u0304\u2212n )|I j i is orthogonal to all states in the module based on |\u03a6j i.\nIt turns out that it is necessary to separate out the oscillator modes from the\nzero-modes (which we sometimes refer to as primaries). This is because there are divergences in the brane overlaps, which come from the infinite sum over primaries. We\ntherefore want to separate out the finite oscillator contribution from this divergence.\nHence we define a modified Ishibashi state, which is a coherent state defined as\nj\n|Im\nm\u0304 i=\n\nX\ng\nI,J\n\n\u22121\nJ\u2212I J \u0304\u2212J |\u03a6jmm\u0304 i\nMIJ\n\n(17)\n\nHere |\u03a6jmm\u0304 i is annihilated by all oscillator modes except for the zero modes (as\nP\nabove), and has magnetic quantum numbers m and m\u0304.

(\u03b1 is defined in (5).)\n\u03b1\nWe now consider the flowed representations. It was argued in [14] that the 1-brane\ndid not couple to flowed representations. Heuristically, the flowed representations\nrepresent strings winding near the boundary of AdS3 . The 1-brane does not wind\nnear the boundary and hence cannot couple to these states. It might seem that\nthe 2-instanton can couple to these flowed representations. However, the symmetry\nbetween the 1-brane and the 2-instanton in Poincare coordinates shows that in fact\nthere is no such coupling.\nThis result is also a consequence of Cardy's condition. The overlap of the 2instantons should be the same as that of the 1-branes (again due to the symmetry\nin Poincare coordinates.) If the 2-instanton couples to flowed representations, this\nmatching is destroyed. Hence we conclude that the 2-instanton does not couple to\nflowed representations.\n6\n\n\f3.2.3\n\n0-instantons\n\nThe conjugacy class cosh \u03c1 cosh \u03c4 = constant was obtained from the conjugacy class\ncosh \u03c1 sinh \u03c4 = constant by the further shift \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 i\u03c02 .

This is in fact not the case.\nTo see this, note that the usual D-instanton looks like a ten dimensional delta\nfunction. The brane wrapped on the conjugacy class instead satisfies\nhx|C 0I i = \u03b4(cosh \u03bb \u2212 1)\n\n(33)\n\nand hence\nZ\n\ndxhx|C 0I i =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bb sinh2 \u03bb \u03b4(cosh \u03bb \u2212 1) = 0\n\n(34)\n\nHence the normalization is incorrect for this state to be a D-instanton. Similarly the\nother 0-instantons do not resemble known D-branes in the flat space limit.\nAs we shall now see, the 0-instantons do not satisfy Cardy's condition either. To\nsee this, we shall compute the overlap of a 2-instanton with a 0-instanton.\n\n4.3\n\nOverlaps of 2-instantons and 0-instantons\n\nThe 0-instanton will be labelled by \u03bb0 , and the 2-instanton will be labelled by \u03b10 .\nThe overlap of primaries (using (31)) is\nc\nhC \u03030I |q L0 +L\u03040 \u2212 12 |C 2I i =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03bb\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2\n\nd\u03c3\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\nd\u03c6 sinh2 \u03bb cos \u03c3\n\n\u00d7 \u03b4(cosh \u03bb \u2212 cosh \u03bb0 )\nFor \u03bb0 = 0, the integral is easily seen to be zero.\n8\n\nZ\n\ns2\nds \u2212 1 2(k\u22122)\nei(\u03b1\u2212\u03b10 )s\nq 4q\n(35)\n2\u03c0\ncosh \u03b1\n\n\fMore generally, changing variables from \u03c3 to \u03b1, the integral is seen to be\nhC \u03030I |q\n\nc\nL0 +L\u03040 \u2212 12\n\n2I\n\n|C i = 2\u03c0q\n\n\u2212 41\n\nZ\n\ns\n\nk\u22122\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b10 )2 (k \u2212 2)\nd\u03b1\nexp\n2i\u03c0 2 \u03c4\n2i\u03c0\u03c4\n\u2212\u03bb0\n\u03bb0\n\n!\n\n(36)\n\nQ\n\n2n \u22123\nThe oscillators contribute an extra factor [ \u221e\nn=1 (1 \u2212 q )] .\nCombining this with the contribution from the primaries, we find the overlap of\nthe boundary states. This resulting expression does not yield a good open string\npartition function upon modular transformation.\nThis indicates that both the 2-instanton and the 0-instanton cannot be included\nconsistently in the theory. Since the 2-instanton is related to the 1-brane by flipping\nx, \u03c4\u0303 in Poincare coordinates, we should have both these branes in the theory. On the\nother hand, we have seen that the 0-instanton does not have a good flat space limit.\nHence we find that the 0-instantons should be discarded.\n\n4.4\n\nOverlaps of 2-instantons and 1-branes\n\nWe now turn to the overlap of a 2-instanton and a 1-brane. We need to regulate\na divergence, because the intersection of the D1-brane and the 2-instanton is the\ncommon solution in AdS3 of the equations cosh \u03c1 sinh \u03c4 = const and sinh \u03c1 sin \u03c6 =\nconst, which has an infinite volume. Indeed, the volume of the intersection region is\nZ\n\ndx \u03b4(sinh \u03b1 \u2212 sinh \u03b10 ) \u03b4(sinh \u03c8 \u2212 sinh \u03c80 )\n=\n\nZ\n\nq\n\nd\u03c1d\u03c8d\u03b1 sinh \u03c1 cosh \u03c1 cosh \u03c8 cosh \u03b1\n\n(sinh2 \u03c1 \u2212 sinh2 \u03c8)(cosh2 \u03c1 + sinh2 \u03b1)\n\u00d7 \u03b4(sinh \u03b1 \u2212 sinh \u03b10 ) \u03b4(sinh \u03c8 \u2212 sinh \u03c80 )\n\n(37)\n\nFor large \u03c1 (at fixed \u03b1, \u03c8), there is a volume divergence as the volume grows as\nV \u223c\n\nZ\n\n\u03c10\n\nd\u03c1 \u223c \u03c10\n\n(38)\n\nThis implies that the open string partition function will have a volume divergence.\nIt can be written as\nZopen \u223c \u03c10 Z\u0303\n\n(39)\n\nwhere Z\u0303 is finite.\nNow since the open string partition function is divergent, for consistency the\noverlap of the branes on the closed string side should also be divergent with a leading\ndivergence proportional to \u03c10 , and as we shall see, this is true. To check Cardy's\ncondition, we can drop the common divergent factor \u03c10 , and examine the modular\ntransformation of the remaining piece.\nThe overlap of primaries (using (31)) is\nc\nhC \u03032I |q L0 +L\u03040 \u2212 12 |C 1D i =\n\nZ\n\nq\n\nd\u03c1d\u03c8d\u03b1 sinh \u03c1 cosh \u03c1 cosh \u03c8 cosh \u03b1\n\n(sinh2 \u03c1 \u2212 sinh2 \u03c8)(cosh2 \u03c1 + sinh2 \u03b1)\n\u00d7 \u03b4(sinh \u03b1 \u2212 sinh \u03b10 )\n9\n\nZ\n\ns2\nds \u2212 1 2(k\u22122)\nei(\u03c8\u2212\u03c80 )s\nq 4q\n(40)\n2\u03c0\ncosh \u03c8\n\n\fFor large \u03c1 at fixed \u03b1, \u03c8, this behaves as\nZ\n\n\u03c10\n\nd\u03c1d\u03c8d\u03b1 \u03b4(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b10 )\n\nZ\n\ns2\n1\nds \u2212 1 ( 2(k\u22122)\n) i(\u03c8\u2212\u03c8\u03030 )s\ne\n\u223c q \u2212 4 \u03c10\nq 4q\n2\u03c0\n\n(41)\n\nThe oscillator contribution comes from states with J 3 = J \u03043 = 0, since only they have\noverlap with both the 1-brane and the 2-instanton. They occur with a relative phase\nin the two Ishibashi states; for every action of J \u0304n3 or J \u0304n2 (n \u2265 0), the relative phase is\nmultiplied by (\u22121).

(There is no residual current algebra, since the boundary conditions of the\n1-brane and the 2-instanton are incompatible.)\n\n5\n\nParafermionic branes\n\nWe start by reviewing the SU(2) case. Here the A-branes were constructed by [25].\nThey can be written\n|A, \u0135iC =\n\nX\nj\n\nSjj\n\nq\n\nS0j\n\n|A, jii\n\n(44)\n\nHere the LHS is the Cardy state, while |A, jii is the SU(2) Ishibashi state.\nThe idea of [15] is to use a different CFT realization of the SU(2) theory using\nparafermions. The Hilbert space of the SU(2) WZW model can be decomposed as\nSU(2)k = (U(1)k \u00d7 (P F )k )/ZZk , where (P F )k is the parafermion theory.\nThere is a corresponding decomposition of the Cardy states into Cardy states of\nthe parafermion theory and the U(1) theory [15]\n1 X\nU (1)\n|A, \u0135iC = \u221a\n|A\u0135n\u0302iPC F |An\u0302iC\nk n\u0302\n\n(45)\n\nThe detailed description of the Ishibashi states and Cardy states can be found in [15].\nWe will not need the detailed knowledge of the parafermionic theory.\nWe can now perform a T-duality on the U(1) theory. This exchanges Dirichlet and\nNeumann conditions. The A-brane above is the one satisfying Dirichlet conditions\nU (1)\n\n(\u2202\u03b6 \u2212 \u2202\u03b6\u0304 )|An\u0302iC\n10\n\n=0\n\n(46)\n\n\f(we are representing the U(1) theory by a free boson \u03b6.)\nThe branes with Neumann boundary conditions are the B-branes satisfying\nU (1)\n\n(\u2202\u03b6 + \u2202\u03b6\u0304 )|B, \u03b7iC\n\n=0\n\n(47)\n\nThus, after T-duality, we find a new set of branes in the SU(2) theory [15]\n2k\u22121\n1\nU (1) X\n\u221a\n|B, \u03b7iC\n|A\u0135n\u0302iPC F\n|B, \u0135, \u03b7 = \u00b11iC =\nk\nn\u0302=0\n\n5.1\n\n(48)\n\nShape of the branes\n\nThe shape of these branes can be found in the semiclassical limit.\nThe primaries of the SU(2) theory can be written\n\u03a6jmm\u0304 = Vmj m\u0304 eim\u03b6+im\u0304\u03b6\u0304\n\n(49)\n\nwhere Vmj m\u0304 is an operator in the parafermion theory and \u03b6 is a free boson.\nIn coordinates where the metric of SU(2) is ds2 = d\u03b7 2 + cos2 \u03b7d\u03b3 2 + sin2 \u03b7d\u03b82\nm + m\u0304 and m \u2212 m\u0304 are the momenta conjugate to translations in \u03b3 and \u03b8 respectively.\nThe B-branes are Neumann with respect to \u03b6 i.e. they only couple to states with\nm = m\u0304 = 0.

First\nwe will look at the overlap of the A-brane with the B-brane.\nThe overlaps of the A- and B-branes in AdS3 is divergent and can be understood\nin the same way as in section (4.4).\nThe intersection region has a volume\nZ\n\nd\u03c1d\u03c8d\u03c4\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\ncosh \u03c1 sinh \u03c1 cosh \u03c8 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nq\n\nsinh2 \u03c1 \u2212 sinh2 \u03c8)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u00d7\uf8ed\n\n(T \u03b4(sinh \u03c8 \u2212 sinh \u03c80 ))\n\uf8f6\n\nT \u0398(sinh \u03c1 \u2212 sinh \u03c80 ) \uf8f8\nq\n\u03c0 sinh2 \u03c1 \u2212 sinh2 \u03c80 )\n\n(58)\n\nwhich is divergent as \u03c1 tends to infinity at fixed \u03c8, \u03c4 .

Accordingly\nthe oscillators contribute a factor\nQ\u221e\n\nn=1 (1\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nq 2n )(1\n\n(62)\n\n\u2212 q 2n )(1 + q 2n )\n\nAfter modular transformation, we find that the resulting open string partition\nfunction can be understood as the partition function of three bosons, one having\nNeumann-Dirichlet conditions, and the other two satisfying Neumann boundary conditions.\nHence the overlap so far is consistent with Cardy's condition. However, this only\ntests the proposal (57) in the limit \u03c1 \u223c \u221e. So we have established so far that\nlim hx|Bi = e\u2212\u03c1\n\n(63)\n\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\n\nWe now turn to the overlap of the B-brane with itself. As usual there is a divergence\nin the overlap coming from the region \u03c1 \u223c \u221e.\nAt \u03c1 \u223c \u221e, e\u2212\u03c1 is an eigenvalue of the Laplacian\n\u2737e\u2212\u03c1 =\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n\u2202\u03c1 cosh \u03c1 sinh \u03c1\u2202\u03c1 e\u2212\u03c1 \u223c \u2212e\u2212\u03c1\ncosh \u03c1 sinh \u03c1\n\n(64)\n\nwith eigenvalue \u22121 \u2212 s2 = \u22121.

If this is to be the exact final\nanswer, then the overlap of the branes should only come from the s = 0 state. In the\nlarge k limit, this is the primary satisfying\n\n\u2737\u03a6 = \u2212\u03a6\n13\n\n(67)\n\n\f1\nF ( 1 , 1 , 1, tanh2 \u03c1).\nwhich is solved by \u03a6 = cosh\n\u03c1 2 1 2 2\nIn this limit the shape of the B-brane is therefore\n\nhx|Bi \u221d\n\n1\n1 1\n2\n2 F1 ( , , 1, tanh \u03c1)\ncosh \u03c1\n2 2\n\n(68)\n\nwhich is consistent with the limit (63).\nWe can therefore write the boundary state for the parafermionic brane as\n|Bi = T |I 0 i\n\n(69)\n\nwhere |I 0 i is the coherent state defined in (17)\n|I 0 i =\n\nX\ng\nI,J\n\n\u22121\nMIJ\nK\u2212I K\u0304\u2212J |\u03a60 i\n\n(70)\n\n3\n0\nwhere K 1 , K 2 are the\nmodes,\n\u0011\n\u0010 and\n\u0011 K is the free boson \u03b6. |\u03a6 i is the\n\u0010 parafermionic\nc\n|\u03a60 i = \u2212 14 |\u03a60 i\nprimary satisfying L0 + L\u03040 \u2212 12\nThis describes a 3-brane covering the entire AdS3 space.\nIn the flat space limit, the brane couples only to modes with s2 \u223c p2 = 0. Hence\nit appears locally like a flat space three-brane. The other branes which do not cover\nthe whole AdS3 do not satisfy Cardy's condition. This is in agreement with the flat\nspace limit, where we do not have boundary states for open branes.\nThe total integral of the three-form field strength through the brane is nonzero.\nHowever, the brane is noncompact, so there is no obvious problem.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nWe have discussed several different branes in AdS3 . The ones that satisfy Cardy's\ncondition are\n\u2022 The 1-brane: This is a brane wrapping the conjugacy class sinh \u03c8 = constant.\nThe boundary state for this brane is given in (19).\n\u2022 The 2-instanton: This is a brane wrapping the conjugacy class cosh \u03c1 sinh \u03c4 =\nconstant. The boundary state for this brane is given in (24).\n\u2022 The parafermionic 3-brane: This is a brane wrapping the whole AdS3 space.\nThe boundary state for this brane is given in (69).\nThe overlaps of various combinations of these branes have been computed in [14],\nand in this paper, and from them the open string spectrum on these branes can be\ncalculated.\nThe overlap of a 1-brane with a 1-brane was calculated in [14], and the open string\nspectrum was found. In the Lorentzian framework, the states on the brane were given\nby the discrete states D\u0302j+,\u03c9 and the continuous states \u0108j\u03b1,\u03c9 . (This was originally found\n14\n\n\fin [13]). In the Euclidean theory, the open strings are in the continuous representations of SL(2,C).\nThe open string spectrum between a 2-instanton and a 2-instanton in the Euclidean theory is the same as that between a 1-brane and a 1-brane i.e. the strings\nare in the continuous representations. There is no Lorentzian analogue for the 2instantons, since these are not states in the Lorentzian theory.\nThe open string spectrum between a 2-instanton and a 1-brane does not preserve the current algebra, and is the theory of three free bosons, two with NeumannDirichlet conditions and one with Neumann boundary conditions.\nThe theory on the open strings connecting the three-brane to itself is the theory\nof three free bosons with Neumann boundary conditions.\nThe theory on the open strings connecting the three-brane to a 1-brane is the theory of three free bosons, two with Neumann boundary conditions and the third with\nNeumann-Dirichlet boundary conditions. The theory on the open strings connecting\nthe three-brane to a 2-instanton is the same.\nWe have only found the spectrum of the various open strings. The interactions of\nthese strings are still largely unknown. This is an important question that deserves\nfurther study.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by DOE grant DE-FG02-96ER40559.\n\n8\n\nAppendix\n\nAdS3 is the universal cover of the group manifold SL(2, IR).
