The technique is applied to a ballistic carbon nanotube\ntransistor in the presence of a time harmonic signal at the gate. In the ON state the dynamic\nconductance exhibits plasmonic resonant peaks at terahertz frequencies. These vanish in the OFF\nstate, and the dynamic conductance displays smooth oscillations, a signature of single particle\nquantum effects. We show that the nanotube kinetic inductance plays an essential role in the\nhigh-frequency behavior.\nPACS numbers: 72.10.Bg, 72.30.+q, 73.22.Lp, 73.63.Fg, 85.35.Kt\n\n1\n\n\fNanoelectronic devices using nanotubes and nanowires as their active elements have been\nextensively studied for their DC properties [1]. However, their high-frequency AC characteristics have received little attention despite the obvious importance for many applications and\nthe breadth of intriguing scientific questions. Experimental work in carbon nanotube (NT)\nand graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) have indicated little performance degradation\nup to GHz frequencies [2]; and recently, time-domain measurements in the terahertz (THz)\nregime have been used to distinguish between plasmon and single-particle excitations at low\ntemperatures in NTs [3].\nThis progress in measuring the high-frequency properties of NTs poses challenging questions for theory and modeling, in particular on how to describe the carrier quantum dynamics\nunder non-equilibrium conditions in realistic device geometries, along with the self-consistent\nfeedback between the time-dependent charge and potential, which is essential to capture the\nplasmonic excitations of the system [4]. In addition, one open question is whether singleparticle and plasmon excitations can be distinguished in low-dimensional systems.\nIn this paper, we address these questions by proposing a formalism for AC quantum\ntransport making use of non-equilibrium Green functions (NEGF) [5], and apply it to determine the high-frequency properties of NTFETs. We find that the dynamic conductance\nexhibits both smooth oscillations and divergent features in the THz regime, indicating the\ncoexistence of single-particle and collective excitations (plasmons). In addition, by calculating the dynamic capacitance, we show that the nanotube kinetic inductance plays a central\nrole in determining the high-frequency behavior, in contrast to conventional FETs.\nWe begin by describing our theoretical approach using the example of a NTFET as\nillustrated in Fig. 1a. (NTs are ideal to study ballistic high-frequency transport due to\nthe large electron mean-free path for acoustic phonon scattering, even at room temperature\n[6].) The system is divided into a device region which is connected to two semi-infinite leads\nconsisting of NTs embedded in source and drain metals. The salient feature is the presence\nof a time-dependent potential at the gate terminal, Vg + e\nvg (t), and we are interested in\n\nthe dynamic source-drain conductance g(\u03c9). This is a much different problem than the\none treated previously mostly within a non-self-consistent approach where either a timedependent potential was applied to the source and drain electrodes [7] or simplified one- or\ntwo-level systems were used [8].\nIn the absence of e\nvg (t), the system is described by the retarded/advanced (\u03b3 = r/a)\n2\n\n\fFIG. 1: (color online) (a) Cross section of the cylindrical NTFET geometry.

H0 is the time-independent Hamiltonian of the\ndevice region while \u03a3\u03b3c couples the device region and the semi-infinite leads; Usc is the timeindependent, spatially-dependent, self-consistent DC electrostatic potential. This Green\nfunction forms the basis for calculations of the DC transport properties of nanosystems.\nIn the presence of e\nvg (t), a time- and spatially-dependent electrostatic potential U(r, t) is\ngenerated in the device region. U(r, t) must be determined based on the complex environment of the nanosystem, and must satisfy self-consistency between charge and electrostatic\npotential, as will be discussed further below. Because of the presence of this time-dependent\npotential, the relevant Green function is the two-time function\nZ\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u2032\n\u2032\nG (t, t ) = G0 (t \u2212 t ) + dt1 G\u03b30 (t \u2212 t1 ) U(t1 )G\u03b3 (t1 , t\u2032 ) .\n\n(2)\n\nWe obtain the frequency-dependent particle current at terminal \u03b1 from the time derivative\nof the number operator as\n\nI\u03b1p (~\u03c9)\n\ne\n= Tr\nh\n\nZ\n\n\b\n<\n+\na\n+\ndE G< (E + , E)\u03a3a\u03b1 (E) \u2212 \u03a3r\u03b1 (E + )G< (E + , E) + Gr (E + , E)\u03a3<\n\u03b1 (E) \u2212 \u03a3\u03b1 (E )G (E , E) ,\n(3)\n\n3\n\n\fwhere E + \u2261 E +~\u03c9. The AC Green functions G\u03b3,< (E + , E) appearing in Eq.(3) are obtained\nfrom Dyson's equation G\u03b3 = G\u03b30 + G\u03b30 UG\u03b3 , whereas the non-equilibrium particle density\n\n<\na\nr < a\nreads G< = (I + Gr U)G<\n0 (I + UG ) following the standard procedure [5].

These equations need to be augmented to\ninclude the coupling of the quantum transport equations with the electrostatics, as embodied\nby Poisson's equation:\n\u2207 * [\u01eb(r)\u2207U(r, \u03c9)] = \u2212\u03c1(r, \u03c9).\n\n(4)\n\n(At the frequencies of interest here, the time dependence of the full Maxwell equations can be\nneglected.) This contribution is especially important to capture the complex environments\nof nanoelectronic devices, and plasmonic effects. Poisson's equation is complemented by\nappropriate boundary conditions at the terminals; in particular at the gate terminal, a timedependent potential e\nvg (t) is applied and serves as the external perturbation that generates\n\nU(r, \u03c9).\n\nA closed set of equations can be obtained by expressing the charge density from the Green\nfunction:\n\u03c1(r, \u03c9) = ie\u03c0\n\n\u22121\n\nZ\n\ndEG< (E + ~\u03c9, E).\n\n(5)\n\nThus, the set of Eqs. (1) \u2212 (5) provides an approach to calculate self-consistently the\nfrequency-dependent current in the presence of a frequency-dependent external gate potential. We note that our approach does not rely on approximations to the wide- or narrow-band\nlimits, but treats the spectral properties of the contacts explicitly.\nTo proceed further, we consider U(r, \u03c9) to be a small perturbation and expand the above\nequations to linear order in U. The Green function of the perturbed system can be obtained\n\u03b3\n1 <,+\n1 r,+\n<\n<\n<\na\nfrom Dyson's equation as G\u03b3 = G\u03b30 + 21 G\u03b3,+\n0 UG0 , while G = G0 + 2 G0 UG0 + 2 G0 UG0 (a\n\n+ superscript indicates a function evaluated at E + ~\u03c9). In practice, one is often interested\nin the small-signal response of the two-terminal conductance g\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c9) = dI\u03b1 (\u03c9)/dV\u03b2 |V\u03b2 =0 . To\nobtain an expression for g\u03b1\u03b2 , we consider a time-harmonic gate potential e\nvg (t) = v0 cos (\u03c9t)\nwhich generates an electrostatic potential U(r, \u03c9) cos (\u03c9t) on the NT. Expanding to lowest\norder in U and V\u03b2 we obtain for the particle conductance\n4\n\n\fp\ng\u03b1\u03b2\n\nZ\n\no\n<,+ a,+\nr e<\na\na a\ne\ne<,+\nGr,+\nU\n(\u03c9)\nG\n\u03a3\n\u2212\n\u03a3\nG\nU\n(\u03c9)\nG\n0\n0\n0 \u03b2\n0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 + G0,\u03b2 U (\u03c9) G0 \u03a3\u03b1\n\u03b2\ni\ne< \u03a3a \u2212 \u03a3r,+ G\ne<,+ U (\u03c9) Ga \u2212 \u03a3r,+ Gr,+ U (\u03c9) G\ne<\nU\n(\u03c9)\nG\n(6)\n+Gr,+\n0\n\u03b1\n0\n\u03b1\n0,\u03b2 \u03b1\n0,\u03b2\n0,\u03b2\n0,\u03b2\n\ne2\nTr\n(\u03c9) =\n2h\n\ndE\n\nhn\n\nwhere e\nh\u03b2 = \u2202h/\u2202V\u03b2 |V\u03b2 =0 for a general function h.\n\nIn general, the particle conductance does not obey fundamental sum rules for current\n\nconservation and gauge invariance, since the displacement current has been omitted. To\ninclude it, we adopt the scheme of Wang et.al.

The first step is to obtain the DC properties of the\nNTFET; details of the numerical procedures are given in Ref. [10]. The (17,0) NT of radius\nR = 0.66 nm is modeled using a pz -tight-binding model with an overlap energy of \u03b30 = 2.5\neV, giving a bandgap of 0.55 eV. The Fermi levels EF of the source and drain metals are\nset 1 eV below the NT midgap before self-consistency, which gives a p-type ohmic contact\nafter self-consistency. Fig. 1b shows the DC transfer characteristics of the NTFET with a\nchannel length L = 30 nm, which consist of an ON-state where the bands are essentially\nflat, and an OFF-state where a gate-controlled barrier blocks the hole current (Fig. 1c). To\nexplore the AC behavior of the NTFET, we first choose a DC operating point, either in the\nON or OFF state as marked by arrows in Fig. 1b, and apply an AC gate signal perturbation\nof frequency \u03c9 and magnitude v0 = 10 meV. Figure 2a shows the real and imaginary parts\nof the AC conductance in the OFF state which displays smooth oscillations as a function\nof frequency. (g(\u03c9 = 0) is negative because the AC perturbation v0 cos(\u03c9t) reduces to a\npositive DC voltage perturbation \u03b4Vg = v0 . According to the DC transfer characteristics\nof Fig. 1b an increase in DC gate bias leads to a reduced conductance.)

(b) Color plot of the density of states along the channel, showing the resonant\nphotoexcitation of carriers through energy and spatially oscillating quantum states. The valence\nband edge is marked with the solid black line, and EF = \u22121 eV.\n\nfinite frequencies the AC conductance can take values larger than the DC conductance. The\norigin of this behavior and of the smooth oscillations can be understood from the spatially\nand energy dependent density of states (DOS) in the OFF state shown in Fig. 2b. At a given\nposition along the NT the DOS shows oscillations in energy with a characteristic frequency\nof about 25 THz. The maxima in g(\u03c9) arise from the photoexcitation of carriers between\nmaxima of the DOS while the minima in g(\u03c9) arise from the excitation between maxima\nand minima of the DOS. Thus, in the OFF state, smooth conductance oscillations are a\nsignature of the single-particle excitation spectrum. The oscillatory character of g(\u03c9) is\npreserved when the self-consistent feedback between charge and potential is disabled (not\nshown), confirming this nature of transport.\nFigure 3a displays the real and imaginary parts of the dynamic conductance g(\u03c9) for\nthe same NTFET in the ON-state, which is also slightly negative at \u03c9 = 0 for the same\nreason as in the OFF-state. We observe that the response for frequencies less than about 4\nTHz is constant, in agreement with the experiments in Ref. [2]. For larger frequencies we\nobserve that the conductance exhibits a pronounced divergent response at \u03c9/2\u03c0 \u2248 24 THz\nwith an underlying oscillatory behavior. Near the divergence, the self-consistent potential\nalong the NT reveals large amplitude oscillations, which change phase as the divergence is\ncrossed. These large amplitude oscillations are shown for a device with L = 90 nm channel\nlength in Fig. 3b, including the higher-order modes.

Top inset compares the self-consistent and non-self-consistent results. Bottom inset\nshows the dielectric function versus frequency. Panel (b) shows the periodic potential near the\nplasmon frequencies for L = 90 nm. Panel (c) shows the response for three different channel\nlengths.\n\nsuggests that plasmons are responsible for the divergent behavior. In order to ascertain that\nthe response calculated in the ON-state can be attributed to collective rather than single\nparticle excitations, we compare in Fig. 3a (top inset) the self-consistent (SC) response\ng(\u03c9) with the non-self-consistent solution obtained from the first iteration. The divergence\nin the conductance disappears entirely while the smooth oscillations persist. Thus, the\nself-consistency between the charge and potential is essential to observe the divergence, a\nsignature of a collective phenomenon. In the ON state we therefore have the coexistence of\nsingle-particle and plasmonic effects.\nFurthermore, from the amplitude of the potential oscillations we can obtain the dielectric\nfunction of the NTFET from \u01eb(\u03c9) = Uext (\u03c9) /U (\u03c9). As shown in the bottom inset of Fig. 3a,\n\u01eb(\u03c9) shows a clear zero crossing at the frequency where g (\u03c9) displays divergent behavior,\n7\n\n\fand is further evidence for the excitation of plasmons. In the simplest model, \u03b5 (q, \u03c9) =\n1 \u2212 \u03c7 (q, \u03c9) K (q) where \u03c7 (q, \u03c9) is the response function and K (q) is the electrostatic Green\nfunction for Poisson's equation. In the ON state, the NT is effectively like a quasi-onedimensional electron gas, where for small q, \u03c7 (q, \u03c9) \u2192 2q 2 kF /m\u03c0\u03c9 2, with kF the Fermi\nwavevector and m the effective mass [11]. K(q) is obtained by using the Green function for\na NT in free space surrounded by a dielectric \u03b5ox , K(q) =\n\ne2\nI (qR)K0 (qR).\n\u03b5ox 0\n\n(This is a good\n\n\u22121\napproximation to the full K(q) when q \u226b RG\nwhere Rg = 4 nm is the gate radius.) Near\n\nthe threshold voltage we obtain the plasmon frequencies for the NTFET by quantizing the\nplasmon excitations to the channel length, i.e. qn = (\u03c0/L) (2n + 1), giving the frequencies\np\n\u03c9n = vLp (2n + 1) I0 (n\u03c0R/L) K0 I0 (n\u03c0R/L) where vp is the plasmon group velocity. To test\nthe scaling of the plasmon frequencies with channel length and mode number, we calculated\n\nthe AC response for NTFETs up to channel lengths of 90 nm; inspection of Fig. 3c indicates\nthat the plasmon frequencies scale linearly with L\u22121 and n, with a plasmon velocity of\nvp = 2.7 \u00d7 106 m/s, about four times larger than the Fermi velocity.\nOur modeling approach also allows the study of the fundamental processes that control\nthe AC properties of nanoelectronic devices. As an example, we show in Fig. 4 the real\npart of the total dynamic capacitance defined as C(\u03c9) = Q(\u03c9)/v0 with Q the total charge\non the NT. At small frequencies Re[C(\u03c9)] is positive implying a capacitive-like behavior,\nbut becomes inductive at \u2248 8 THz as marked by the sign change. This characteristics is\nfundamentally different from that of traditional FETs which show only capacitive behavior.\nThe origin of this unconventional behavior is the nanotube kinetic inductance. Indeed, we\ncan model the NTFET as a classical RLC circuit as shown in Fig. 4 (inset), for which the\ndynamic capacitance Re[C(\u03c9)] \u221d 1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 LK C0 where LK is the nanotube kinetic inductance\nand C0 is the zero-frequency capacitance. This gives a transition to inductive behavior at\n\u221a\n\u03c9 = 1/ LK C0 , and from our numerical data for C(\u03c9) we extract LK = 0.2 nH for the 30\nnm device. This value is consistent with that expected from simple arguments [12].\nIn summary, we presented a new self-consistent approach for AC quantum transport\nand applied it to determine the high-frequency response of NTFETs. In the ON-state, the\ndynamic conductance shows divergent peaks, which are associated with the excitation of\nplasmons of the gated NTFET acting as resonant quantum cavity, whose mode spectrum\ncan be tuned by varying the channel length. Our results suggest that low-dimensional\nsystems with nanometer sized channels show potential for novel detectors and emitters of\n8\n\n\fRe[C(\n\n)] (aF)\n\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n0.0\n\nC0 R\n2.0x10\n\n12\n\nLK\n4.0x10\n\n12\n\n/2\n\n6.0x10\n\n12\n\n8.0x10\n\n12\n\n1.0x10\n\n13\n\n(Hz)\n\nFIG. 4: (color online).

The approach can be applied to a broad range of nanoelectronic systems;\nit will be useful for the study of many time-dependent phenomena in low-dimensionality\nsystems including phonon and defect scattering, ultrafast optical excitation, and entirely\nnew operation modes of nanoelectronic devices.\nWe are indebted to M.
