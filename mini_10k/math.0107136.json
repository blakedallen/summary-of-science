We show that P \u0304r admits a\ndescription completely parallel to that of the Verlinde algebra of the fusion\ncategory [AP], with the character of the Steinberg module playing the role of\nthe identity.\n\n1. Introduction and Notations\nFor a semisimple complex Lie algebra g with the root system R and the weight\nlattice P , consider the category O introduced in [BGG]. For any \u03bd \u2208 P let L(\u03bd)\nand M (\u03bd) denote respectively the simple and the Verma module of highest weight\n\u03bd \u2212 \u03c1, where \u03c1 is half the sum of all positive roots, and let P (\u03bd) be the projective\ncover of L(\u03bd) in O. It is well known (e.g. [Hum1]) that for a dominant integral\n\u03bb \u2208 P+ and the longest element w0 of the Weyl group W , the projective module\nP (w0 (\u03bb)) has a particularly nice structure. It is usually called the big projective\nmodule and has a Verma flag with the multiplicityP\nof each M (w(\u03bb)), w \u2208 W , equal\nto one. In terms of characters, if we write chM = \u03b7\u2208P (dimM\u03b7 )e\u03b7 \u2208 C[P ] for the\nformal character of M \u2208 O, then for a big projective module we have\nX\n1 X w(\u03bb)\nchP (w0 (\u03bb)) =\nchM (w(\u03bb)) = chM (0)\ne\n,\n|W\u03bb |\nw\u2208W\n\nw\u2208W/W\u03bb\n\nwhere W\u03bb \u2282 W is the stabilizer subgroup of the weight \u03bb. The elements\n1 X w(\u03bb)\ne\n,\n\u03bb \u2208 P+ ,\nf (\u03bb) =\n|W\u03bb |\nw\u2208W\n\ncan be viewed as a natural basis in the space C[P ]W of exponential W -invariants\non the weight lattice P . The relation between this basis and the basis of Weyl\ncharacters\nP\nw(\u03bb+\u03c1)\nX\nw\u2208W \u03b5(w)e\n= chM (0)\n\u03b5(w)ew(\u03bb+\u03c1) ,\n\u03bb \u2208 P+ ,\n\u03c7(\u03bb) = P\nw(\u03c1)\n\u03b5(w)e\nw\u2208W\nw\u2208W\nreflects a reciprocity between finite dimensional simple and big projective modules\nin the category O.\nWe will investigate a similar reciprocity in the framework of the representation\ntheory of quantum groups at roots of unity. More precisely, we will describe a\ncertain finite set of projective modules over the small quantum group corresponding\nDate: November 7, 2018.\nThis research was conducted by the author for the Clay Mathematics Institute.\n1\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n2\n\nto g, whose characters are given by the same formula as above with the character\nof the Steinberg module replacing chM (0) (cf. [Hum2], \u00a79). The tensor product\ninduces a multiplication in the set of characters of these projective modules, which\nleads to a structure similar to the well known Verlinde algebra of characters of\na certain set of simple modules over the quantum group at a root of unity. The\ncomparative study of these two algebraic objects is the main goal of the present\npaper. We briefly outline the results below; the precise definitions can be found at\nthe end of this section.\nLet Q = ZR denote the root lattice of g. We will assume R to be irreducible\nand simply laced, although the latter restriction is not essential. Fix an integer\nl \u2265 h, where h is the Coxeter number of R (later we will require l to be odd and\ncoprime to the determinant of the Cartan matrix of R, \u00a72), and consider the shifted\naction of the affine Weyl group \u0174l,Q \u2243 W \u22c9 lQ on P . Define the elements \u03c7(\u03bb) for\nnondominant weights by setting \u03c7(\u03bb) = \u03b5(w)\u03c7(w * \u03bb) for any \u03bb \u2208 P, w \u2208 W . Then\nthe quotient\n(V r)\u2212 \u2243 C[P ]W /h(\u03c7(\u03bb) + \u03c7(s * \u03bb)i\u03bb\u2208P,s\u2212a reflection in \u0174l,Q ,\nis isomorphic to the well known Verlinde algebra V r (Corollary 2.2). On the other\nhand, one can consider the natural action of the extended affine group \u0174l,P \u2243\nW \u22c9 lP , where the translations are generated by the l-multiple weight lattice. Set\nf (w(\u03bb)) = f (\u03bb) for any \u03bb \u2208 P , w \u2208 W , and consider the quotient\n(V r)+ \u2243 C[P ]W /h(f (\u03bb) \u2212 f (s(\u03bb))i\u03bb\u2208P,s\u2212a reflection in \u0174l,P\nwith respect to the natural action. The algebra (V r)\u2212 has a basis of Weyl characters\nwith highest weights parametrized by X, the regular elements of the fundamental\ndomain of \u0174l,Q * action, while a basis in (V r)+ is given by f (\u03bb) with \u03bb \u2208 X\u0302 ,\nthe fundamental domain of the natural action of \u0174l,P . The analogy between the\nalgebraic structures and the roles played by the two bases are self-evident. We\nexplain below their representation-theoretical meaning.\nOriginally V r was introduced in [Ver] as the fusion ring with a finite number of\nsimple objects, associated to a semisimple Lie algebra g and a number l \u2265 h. The\nfusion category can be realized in many ways, in particular for our purposes we\nwill view it as a subquotient of the category of finite dimensional modules over the\nrestricted specialization of a quantum group at the l-th root of unity [And], [AP].\nIt turns out that (V r)+ is not only a close analog of (V r)\u2212 from the purely\nalgebraic point of view, but it also shares many important properties of the Verlinde\nalgebra and has a clear representation-theoretical meaning. Namely, let St denote\nthe Steinberg module, which is a simple, projective and injective object in the\ncategory of finite dimensional modules over the big quantum group Uqres (g). Its\ncharacter chSt is given by the Weyl formula of the highest weight (l \u2212 1)\u03c1. We\nshow (Corollary 4.2) that the structure of (V r)+ defines multiplication in the ideal\nP \u0304r of elements corresponding to projective modules in the Grothendieck ring R\u0304\nof finite dimensional representations over the small quantum group Uqf in (g) in the\nfollowing sense:\nX\n[P (\u03bb)][P (\u03bc)] = [St]\nn\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc [P (\u03bd)].\n\u03bd\n\nHere elements {[P (\u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208X\u0302 \u2208 R\u0304 correspond to indecomposable projective modules,\nand the numbers n\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc are the structure constants of the algebra (V r)+ in the\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n3\n\nbasis of W -symmetric functions {f (\u03bb)}\u03bb\u2208X\u0302 . We will also see that for odd l > h,\ncoprime to the determinant of the Cartan matrix, the ideal P \u0304r carries a projective\nrepresentation of the modular group (Proposition 4.5), whereas the algebra V r has\nthis property for even l.\nWhile the Verlinde algebra has been extensively studied in the literature, the\nexistence of its analog P \u0304r seems to be new. Based on the analogy between V r\nand P \u0304r, we expect that the latter will have important applications in various fields\nwhere the Verlinde algebra is involved. In particular, the next natural step would be\nto investigate the possibility of constructing a tensor category with primary objects\nin one-to-one correspondence with the basis in P \u0304r. Another open question is to\nidentify a tensor category over the affine Lie algebra \u011d which corresponds to the\nmultiplicative structure of P \u0304r, similarly to the equivalence of the fusion categories\nstated in [Fin]. The contravariant equivalence between the category with finite\nWeyl filtrations over Uqres (g) and an analogous category over \u011d at a fixed positive\nlevel [Soe1], provides a tool to identify the counterparts of the projective modules\namong the positive level representations of \u011d, though it does not supply the tensor\nstructure.\nThe paper is organized as follows: \u00a72 contains the description of the Verlinde\nalgebra [AP], and its restriction V \u0304r over the small quantum group (Theorem 2.8).In\n\u00a73 we study the algebraic structures behind the category of projective modules\nover Uqres (g) (Theorem 3.4) and Uqf in (g) (Theorem 3.7), and consider the obtained\nresults in the framework of the classification of tensor ideals in the category of\ntilting modules T over Uqres (g) [Ost]. Finally, in \u00a74 we list the similarities of V r\nand P \u0304r.\nDefinitions and notations. We will assume that l is odd everywhere except in\nthe description of the modular group action on the Verlinde algebra at the end of\n\u00a74. Let g be a simply laced simple complex algebra with the root system R and\nthe Weyl group W . The action of W on P is given by s\u03b1 (\u03bc) = \u03bc \u2212 h\u03bc, \u03b1i\u03b1 for\nany \u03b1 \u2208 R, \u03bc \u2208 P , where the inner product h*, *i is normalized so that h\u03b1, \u03b1i = 2\nfor \u03b1 \u2208 R. We will also use the shifted action w * \u03bc = w(\u03bc + \u03c1) \u2212 \u03c1 for any\nP\nw \u2208 W , \u03bc \u2208 P , where \u03c1 = 12 \u03b1\u2208R+ \u03b1. Let \u0174l,Q denote the affine Weyl group\ngenerated by the reflections {s\u03b1,k } for any \u03b1 \u2208 R+ , k \u2208 Z. The natural and shifted\nactions of \u0174l,Q are defined by s\u03b1,k (\u03bc) = s\u03b1 (\u03bc) + kl\u03b1 and s\u03b1,k * \u03bc = s\u03b1 * \u03bc + kl\u03b1\nfor any \u03bc \u2208 P . The sets X\u0302 = {\u03bb \u2208 P+ : h\u03bb, \u03b1i \u2264 l for all \u03b1 \u2208 R+ } and\nX\u0304 = {\u03bb \u2208 P : 0 \u2264 h\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b1i \u2264 l for all \u03b1 \u2208 R+ } are the fundamental domains for\nthe non-shifted and shifted affine Weyl group actions respectively. Since the group\nof translations by lP is also normalized by W , one can consider the semidirect\nproduct \u0174l,P \u2243 W \u22c9 lP , which also naturally acts on P . We define the shifted\naction of \u0174l,P on P by w * \u03bb = w(\u03bb + \u03c1) \u2212 \u03c1 for any w \u2208 \u0174l,P , \u03bb \u2208 P .\nLet \u03a0 \u2208 R+ denote the simple roots, and set r = |\u03a0|, the rank of g. The\naffine Weyl group \u0174l,Q can be viewed as a Coxeter system (\u0174l,Q , S), where S =\n{s0 , s1 , . . . , sr } is the set of reflections with respect to the walls of X\u0304. Here\n{s1 , . . . sr } are the reflections in W corresponding to the simple roots, and s0 is\nthe reflection about the upper wall of X\u0302. The length l(w) of an element in \u0174l,Q is\ndefined as the smallest number n, such that w is a product of n elements of S.\nLet Uv (g) be the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum enveloping algebra associated to a\nsemisimple simply-laced Lie algebra g over Q(v), where v is a formal variable. It is\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n4\n\ngenerated by the elements {Ei , Fi , Ki\u00b11 }ri=1 , with the standard set of relations (see\ne.g. [Lus1]). Denote by Uv (g)Z the Z[v, v \u22121 ] subalgebra of Uv (g) generated by the\n(k)\n\nEk\n\n(k)\n\nFk\n\ni\ndivided powers Ei = [k]!i , Fi = [k]!\nand Ki , Ki\u22121 for i = 1 . . . r, k \u2208 N, k \u2265 1,\nQk vs \u2212v\u2212s\nwhere [k]! = s=1 v\u2212v\u22121 . Then the restricted quantum group Uqres (g) is defined\nby Uqres (g) = Uv (g)Z \u2297Z[v,v\u22121 ] Q(q), where v maps to q \u2208 C, which is set to be a\nprimitive l-th root of unity. By [Lus1], we have for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r: Eil = 0, Fil = 0,\nKi2l = 1, and Kil is central in Uqres (g).\nLet Uqf in (g) be the finite dimensional subquotient of Uqres (g) [Lus2], generated\nby {Ei , Fi , Ki\u00b11 }ri=1 over Q(q), factorized over the two-sided ideal h{Kil \u2212 1}ri=1 i.\nThen Uqf in (g) is a Hopf algebra of dimension ldimg over Q(q). We will use the same\nnotations for the C-algebras Uqres (g) and Uqf in (g), where the field Q(q) is extended\nto C.\nLet Cf denote the category of finite dimensional modules of type 1 over Uqres (g),\ni.e. such that the central elements {Kil }i=1...r act by 1 in any object of Cf .\nLet C \u0304f be the category of finite dimensional modules over Uqf in (g). For a module M in Cf (resp. C \u0304f ) we will denote by [M ] its image in the Grothendieck\nring [Cf ] (resp. [C \u0304f ]). We denote by R (resp. R\u0304) the complexification of the\nring [Cf ]P\n(resp. [C \u0304f ]). We will use the symbol chM for the formal character\n\u03b7\nW\n\u03b7\nchM =\n\u03b7\u2208P (dimM\u03b7 )e \u2208 Z[P ] , where we write e for the basis element in\nC[P ] corresponding to \u03b7 \u2208 P . Then C[P ] can be considered as a space of functionals on the subalgebra (Uqres (g))0 \u2282 Uqres (g), which is generated by Ki\u00b11 and the\nQ\nK q1\u2212s \u2212Ki\u22121 qs\u22121\nproducts ls=1 i qs \u2212q\u2212s\nfor all i = 1, . . . , r; in particular e\u03b7 (K\u03b2 ) = q <\u03b7,\u03b2>\nfor any \u03b7 \u2208 P, \u03b2 \u2208 Q. Throughout\nthe paper we will denote by f (\u03bb) the normalized\nP\n1\nW -symmetric function |W\u03bb | w\u2208W ew(\u03bb) \u2208 C[P ]W , where W\u03bb is the stabilizer subgoup of \u03bb.

The fusion category\nInequivalent simple finite dimensional modules in Cf are in one-to-one correspondence with the dominant weights P+ [Lus1]. The Weyl modules, also parametrized\nby P+ , can be defined as the quantum deformations of simple finite dimensional\nmodules for the classical universal enveloping algebra U (g) [Lus1]. They play the\nrole of the universal highest weight modules in Cf . Both the Weyl modules and their\nduals have their characters given by the Weyl formula, though in general they are\nnot simple over Uqres (g). It follows that the Grothendieck ring of the non-semisimple\ncategory Cf is isomorphic to Z[P ]W , the isomorphism given by [M ] \u2192 chM . The\ncategory Cf can be decomposed into a direct sum of subcategories according to the\nlinkage principle [APW1]: If simple modules L(\u03bc1 ) and L(\u03bc2 ) both are composition\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n5\n\nfactors of an indecomposable module M \u2208 Cf , then \u03bc1 \u2208 \u0174l,Q * \u03bc2 . A tilting module\nis defined as an element T of Cf such that both T and its dual T \u2217 have filtrations\nwith factors isomorphic to Weyl modules [And], [APW1]. The indecomposable tilting modules are also parametrized by P+ . One of the most important properties\nof the non-abelian category of tilting modules T is that it is closed with respect\nto tensor products [And], [Par]. In the present work we will need the description\nof a semisimple quotient of T , the fusion category, which we briefly outline below,\nfollowing [AP].\nThe fusion category F us over Uqres (g). Let R \u2243 C[P ]W denote the algebra of\ncharacters of the category Cf , which is the complexification of the Grothendieck\nring [Cf ]. Then R has a natural basis of simple characters {[L(\u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208P+ , as well as\na basis of Weyl characters {[W (\u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208P+ , and of indecomposable tilting characters\n{[T (\u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208P+ .\nDefine the first dominant alcove\nX = {\u03bb \u2208 P+ : h\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b1i < l for all \u03b1 \u2208 R+ }.\nTheorem 2.1. [AP] Decompose the algebra of characters of the category Cf into a\nsum\nR = V r \u2295 J,\nwhere\nV r = spanC {[T (\u03bb)], \u03bb \u2208 X},\nJ = spanC {[T (\u03bb)], \u03bb \u2208 P+ \\ X}.\nThen\nJ = spanC {[W (\u03bb)] + [W (s * \u03bb)]}\u03bb,s*\u03bb\u2208P+ are in adjacent alcoves,s\u2212a refl. in \u0174l,Q .\nWe will need the following consequence of this result. Define the elements [W (\u03bb)]\nfor non-dominant weights by setting [W (w * \u03bb)] = \u03b5(w)[W (\u03bb)] for any \u03bb \u2208 P+ ,\nw \u2208 W.\nCorollary 2.2. In the notation of Theorem 2.1,\nJ = spanC {[W (\u03bb)] + [W (s * \u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208P,s\u2212a reflection in \u0174l,Q .\nProof. Suppose that sH \u2208 \u0174l,Q is a reflection about a hyperplane H \u2282 P , \u03bb\u2032 = sH *\u03bb\nand \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb are not in the adjacent alcoves. Then sH can be written as a composition\nof reflections sH = s1 . . . sk such that s1 * (\u03bb0 = \u03bb) = \u03bb1 , . . . , sk * \u03bbk\u22121 = \u03bbk = \u03bb\u2032\nand each two weights \u03bbi , \u03bbi+1 lie in adjacent alcoves. The number of reflections k is\nPk\u22121\nodd, and therefore any [W (\u03bb)] + [W (sH * \u03bb)] = i=0 (\u22121)i ([W (\u03bbi )] + [W (si+1 * \u03bbi )])\nbelongs to J. By the definition of [W (\u03bb)] \u2208 R for \u03bb \u2208\n/ P+ , we have [W (\u03bb)] +\n[W (si * \u03bb)] = 0 if si is a reflection about one of the hyperplanes through \u2212\u03c1, then\nthe condition that \u03bb, s * \u03bb \u2208 P+ can be dropped, and we get the statement of the\nCorollary.\nThe subspace J is a multiplicative ideal in R ([AP], 3.19) and therefore the\nquotient V r \u2243 R/J is a commutative associative algebra with a unit (the Verlinde\nalgebra). Multiplication rules in V r can be written in the basis of tilting characters:\nX\n[T (\u03bb)][T (\u03bc)] =\na\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc [T (\u03bd)] (modJ),\n\u03bd\u2208X\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n6\n\nwhere a\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc , \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 X, \u03bd \u2208 P+ are the coefficients of decomposition of the tensor\nproduct of two tilting modules into indecomposables. For \u03bb \u2208 X, each tilting\nmodule is a Weyl module and its character is given by a unique element [W (\u03bb)] \u2208 R.\nLet T \u2032 be the subcategory of T whose objects are tilting modules with no indecomposable component of highest weight in X. Then by the above, the subcategory\nT \u2032 of modules with characters in J is a tensor ideal in T . This gives rise to a reduced tensor product structure of the category F us \u2243 T /T \u2032 with the fusion ring\ndefined above.\nThe ideal T \u2032 \u2282P\nT admits an equivalent characterization\nterms of the quantum\nQin\nr\nr\ntraces. For \u03bc = i=1 ni \u03b1i \u2208 Q, \u03b1i \u2208 \u03a0, define K\u03bc \u2261 i=1 Kini , where ni \u2208 Z.\nFor any M \u2208 Cf and any Uqres (g)-endomorphism \u03c6 of\nQM , define the quantum trace\ntrq (\u03c6) by setting trq (\u03c6) = tr(K2\u03c1 \u03c6), where K2\u03c1 = \u03b1\u2208R+ K\u03b1 and tr is the usual\ntrace on M . The quantum dimension of a module is defined to be the quantum\ntrace of the identity morphism.\nProposition 2.3. [And] Let M \u2208 T \u2032 . Then for any Uqres (g)-endomorphism \u03c6 of\nM , trq (\u03c6) = 0. In particular, dimq (M ) = 0.\nNow we will consider the corresponding categorical and algebraic constructions\nover the small quantum group Uqf in (g).\nRestriction of Cf to Uqf in (g). The category C \u0304f of finite dimensional modules\nover Uqf in (g) inherits many of its properties from the category Cf [Lus2], [APW2].\nSimple modules in C \u0304f are parametrized by their highest weights, and inequivalent\nsimple modules are the restrictions of those over Uqres (g) with the restricted highest\nweights Pl \u2261 {\u03bb \u2208 P+ : h\u03bb, \u03b1i i \u2264 l \u2212 1 for all \u03b1i \u2208 \u03a0}. Define the character of a\nsimple module L(\u03bb), \u03bb \u2208 Pl over Uqf in (g) to be the corresponding element [L(\u03b7)]\nof the Grothendieck ring [C \u0304f ] of the category C \u0304f . Then for any finite dimensional\nUqf in (g)-module M with composition factors L(\u03b7) of multiplicities n\u03b7 , define the\ncharacter of M by the formula\nX\n[M ] =\nn\u03b7 [L(\u03b7)] \u2208 [C \u0304f ].\n\u03b7\u2208Pl\n\nThe characters of simple modules {[L(\u03b7)]}\u03b7\u2208Pl form a basis in R\u0304, the complexification of the Grothendieck ring [C \u0304f ]. The multiplicative structure of the algebra R\u0304\ncan be obtained from that of R \u2243 C[P ]W using the tensor product decomposition\nfor simple modules {L(\u03bc)}\u03bc\u2208P+ over Uqres (g):\nTheorem 2.4. [Lus1] Let \u03bc = \u03bc0 + l\u03bc1 \u2208 P+ be a dominant weight such that\n0 \u2264 h\u03bc0 , \u03b1i i \u2264 l \u2212 1 for all \u03b1i \u2208 \u03a0. Then\nL(\u03bc0 + l\u03bc1 ) \u2243 L(\u03bc0 ) \u2297 L(l\u03bc1 )\nas Uqres (g)-modules. The restriction of L(\u03bc0 ) to Uqf in (g) is a simple Uqf in (g)module.\nThe subquotient Uqf in (g) of Uqres (g) acts trivially on the simple module L(l\u03bc1 ),\nwhose weights are all in lP . By restriction, simple Uqres (g)-modules of type 1 are\nmodules over Uqf in (g). Therefore, the algebra of characters R\u0304 of Uqf in (g)-modules\ncan be obtained from that of Uqres (g) by setting the characters of simple modules\nwith l-multiple highest weights equal to their dimensions, and we get\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n7\n\nCorollary 2.5.

For an element g \u2208 R, we will write \u1e21\nfor its image in R\u0304 under the homomorphism R \u2192 R\u0304 induced by the restriction of\nUqres (g)-modules to Uqf in (g).\nWe are interested in the multiplicative structures associated to the category\nC \u0304f . Since it is not semisimple (which is inherited from non-semisimplicity of Cf ),\nthe algebra of characters described in Corollary 2.5 gives only partial information,\nnamely the multiplicities of simple modules in the filtration of a tensor product. As\nin the case of T \u2282 Cf , it would be convenient to define a subcategory in C \u0304f designed\nto behave nicely with respect to tensor products. This suggests to consider the\nrestriction of tilting modules over Uqf in (g).\nProposition 2.6. The characters {[T (\u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208Pl form a basis in R\u0304.\nProof. Define a partial ordering in Pl by \u03bb\u2265l \u03bc if there exists a weight \u03bc1 \u2208 P+ such\nthat \u03bb \u2265 \u03bc + l\u03bc1 in the usual ordering in P . Then the basis of tilting characters is\nconnected to {[L(\u03b7)]}\u03b7\u2208Pl \u2208 R\u0304 by a triangular transformation with respect to the\nordering \u2265l .\nIt should be mentioned that the restrictions of tilting modules are not tilting\nover Uqf in (g) in the sense of the abstract definition. Still, since Uqf in (g) inherits\nthe coalgebra structure from Uqres (g), the set of restrictions of tilting modules to\nUqf in (g) is closed under the tensor product.\nThe fusion category considered over Uqf in (g). The fusion category was constructed over Uqres (g) as a quotient of the category of tilting modules. The same\nstructure can be considered over the finite dimensional algebra Uqf in (g). Let T\u0304 be\nthe subcategory of C \u0304f whose objects are the restrictions of Uqres (g)-tilting modules\nto Uqf in (g). Then it is closed under the tensor products. The ideal T \u2032 \u2282 T restricts\nto the set of the restrictions of tilting modules with indecomposable components\n(over Uqres (g)) of highest weights in P+ \\ X. The subcategory T\u0304 \u2032 of T\u0304 whose objects\nare the restrictions of tilting modules in T \u2032 , is closed under tensor products.\n \u0304 where J \u0304 is the image of the ideal J under\nLet V \u0304r denote the quotient R\u0304/J,\nthe homomorphism R \u2192 R\u0304, sending the character of a Uqres (g)-module to the\ncharacter of its restriction over Uqf in (g). Then the algebra structure in V \u0304r corresponds to the truncated tensor product of the restrictions of tilting modules with\nno indecomposable components of highest weight in P+ \\ X.\nTo describe the ideal J \u0304 of R\u0304, we have to introduce the action of the affine Weyl\ngroup in Pl .\nNote that the natural (non-shifted) action of the affine Weyl group \u0174l,Q on P\npreserves the lP -lattice in P :\ns\u03b1,k (l\u03bc) = l\u03bc \u2212 lh\u03b1, \u03bci\u03b1 + kl\u03b1 \u2208 lP.\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n8\n\nSimilarly, the shifted action of \u0174l,Q * on P preserves the shifted lattice lP \u2212 \u03c1.\nTherefore, the following actions of \u0174l,Q on Pl can be defined:\n1. the natural (non-shifted) action\nw \u25e6 \u03bb = w(\u03bb) mod(lP )\nfor any \u03bb \u2208 (P/lP )+ , w \u2208 \u0174l,Q , and\n2. the shifted action\nw \u2022 \u03bb = (w * \u03bb) mod(lP )\nfor any \u03bb \u2208 Pl , w \u2208 \u0174l,Q\nBy definition, the results of both actions belong again to Pl .\nSince lQ \u2282 lP , it is enough to consider the \u25e6- and \u2022-actions of elements w \u2208 W\nof the finite Weyl group.\nRecall that the affine Weyl group \u0174l,Q is isomorphic to W \u22c9 lQ, where lQ\ngenerate the translations by l-multiple roots, and consider the affine group \u0174l,P =\nW \u22c9 lP , where the translations are generated by the lP lattice. Let \u03a9 be the\nsubgroup of \u0174l,P stabilizing the alcove X\u0304 (resp. X\u0302) with respect to the shifted\n(resp. non-shifted) action. Suppose that lP \u2229 Q = lQ. This condition is always\nsatisfied if the number l is such that GCD(l, detaij ) = 1 for the Cartan matrix\naij of g ([Lyu1], [La]). To simplify the subsequent considerations, we will assume\nthat this condition holds, and also that l \u2265 h for the root system R of g. Then\nby [Hum3] \u0174l,Q \u2229 \u03a9 = 1, so in fact \u0174l,P is the semidirect product of \u0174l,Q and \u03a9,\nand \u03a9 \u2243 \u0174l,P /\u0174l,Q . The order of \u03a9 is equal to |\u0174l,P /\u0174l,Q | = |P/Q|, the index of\nconnection.\nDenote by X\u0302 the set of representatives for the orbits of the non-shifted action\nof \u03a9 in the alcove X\u0302. Similarly, let X\u0304 = X\u0304/\u03a9 be the set of representatives for the\norbits of \u03a9 with respect to the shifted action. Then X\u02c6 and X\u0304 are the fundamental\ndomains for the W \u25e6 and W \u2022-actions respectively, and |X\u0302 | = |X\u0304 |. Let X \u2282 X\u0304\ndenote the subset of regular weights in X\u0304 , such that their stabilizer in W with\nrespect to the \u2022-action is trivial.\nThe W \u2022-action is designed to formulate the linkage principle for Uqf in (g):\nProposition 2.7. If two simple modules L(\u03bc) and L(\u03bb) both are composition factors in a filtration of an indecomposable Uqf in (g)-module, then \u03bc \u2208 W \u2022 \u03bb.\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nProof. Consider the graded version Uqf in (g) of Uqf in (g) with (Uqf in (g))0 \u2243 (Uqres (g))0 ,\nas defined in e.g. [AJS], \u00a71.3, in which the toric part coincides with that of Uqres (g).\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThen two simple modules L (\u03bb) and L (\u03bc) both are composition factors in an\n\u2022\nUqf in (g)-module\n\nindecomposable\nif and only if \u03bb \u2208 \u0174l,Q * \u03bc [AJS], \u00a76.7. In the\nnon-graded setting this means that any two simple composition factors of an indecomposable module have their highest weights in a \u0174l,Q *-orbit restricted modulo\nlP , which coincides with the definition of an orbit of W \u2022-action. In particular, this\nmeans that the set X \u0304 enumerates the blocks of the category C \u0304f .\nTheorem 2.8.

The ideal\nJ \u0304 of R\u0304 is the image of J \u2282 R under the homomorphism R \u2192 R\u0304.

Let Pr denote the category of projective modules over Uqres (g). Below we list their most important properties.\nProposition 3.1. [APW1]\n1. The Steinberg module St = L((l \u2212 1)\u03c1) is both projective and injective object\nin Cf\n2. All injectives in Cf are projectives and conversely.\n3. All projective objects in Cf are tilting modules. Every indecomposable projective module is isomorphic to some T (\u03bb), \u03bb \u2208 (l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + P+ .\n4. Any indecomposable projective module in Cf is a direct summand of St \u2297 E\nfor some E \u2208 Cf .\nTherefore, the set Pr \u2282 Cf is in fact a subcategory in T . It is also a tensor ideal\nin T , since a direct summand of a projective module is projective, and a tensor\nproduct of a projective module with any module in Cf is again projective. Since St\nis a Weyl module, its character chSt = \u03c7((l \u2212 1)\u03c1) \u2208 C[P ]W is given by the Weyl\ncharacter formula.\nProposition 3.2. The linear span of the characters of projective (injective) modules in C[P ]W coincides with chSt * C[P ]W .\nProof. Any p \u2208 C[P ]W can be written as a linear combination of characters of\nsimple modules in Cf . Since St is projective, any element of the form chSt * p \u2208\nC[P ]W is a linear combination of characters of projective modules. Then we have\n{chSt * f (\u03bb)}\u03bb\u2208P+ \u2282 spanC {chP (\u03bc)}\u03bc\u2208(l\u22121)\u03c1+P+ ,\nwhere f (\u03bb) is the W -symmetric function (\u00a71), and chP (\u03bc) denotes the image in\nC[P ]W of the character of the projective module P (\u03bc) = T (\u03bc) with highest weight\n\u03bc. Note that in the decomposition of chSt * f (\u03bb) into a linear combination of\nprojective characters, only the highest weights \u03bc : (l \u2212 1)\u03c1 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 (l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + \u03bb can\noccur. Therefore, the two sets are related by a lower triangular transformation of\nbases, which provides a bijection between the span of indecomposable projective\ncharacters and chSt * C[P ]W .\nThe next proposition provides the factorization of projective (injective) modules\nover Uqres (g) similar to the statement of Theorem 2.4.\nProposition 3.3. [And] For \u03bb = \u03bb0 + l\u03bb1 \u2208 P+ , where 0 \u2264 h\u03bb0 , \u03b1i i \u2264 l \u2212 1, i =\n1, . . . , r, let \u03bb\u0304 denote the weight \u03bb\u0304 = 2(l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + w0 (\u03bb0 ) + l\u03bb1 \u2208 P+ . Then\n1. The indecomposable tilting module T (\u03bb\u0304) is both projective and injective in Cf ;\n2. T (\u03bb\u0304) \u2243 T (\u03bb \u03040 ) \u2297 L(l\u03bb1 ).\nNow we are can describe the ideal P r \u2208 R. For any \u03bc \u2208 P , let \u0174\u03bc denote\nthe subgroup of \u0174l,Q generated by {s\u03b1,h\u03bc,\u03b1i }\u03b1\u2208\u03a0 . Then \u0174\u03bc stabilizes l\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1 with\nrespect to the shifted action, and is isomorphic to W \u2282 \u0174l,Q .\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n11\n\nTheorem 3.4. The characters of projective modules over Uqres (g) span the ideal of\nR of the form\nX\n[W (w * \u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208P,\u03bc\u2208P .\nP r = spanC {\nw\u2208\u0174\u03bc\n\nProof. We will use the isomorphism \u03c8 : R \u2212\u2192 C[P ]W and prove the corresponding\n\u223c\n\nstatement for \u03c8(P r) \u2282 C[P ]W . The idealPof projective characters coincides with\nthe linear span of {chSt * f (\u03bb)}\u03bb\u2208P+ = { w\u2208\u0174\u03c1 \u03c7(w * ((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + \u03bb)}\u03bb\u2208P+ , thus\nall projective characters are in \u03c8(P r). On the other hand, for any \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 P , the\nelement\nX\n\u03c7(w * \u03bb)\nw\u2208\u0174 \u03bc\n\nis either zero, if h\u03bc, \u03b2i = 0 for some \u03b2 \u2208 R, or is equal to\n\u03c7((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + l(\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1)) * f (\u03bb \u2212 l\u03bc).\nIf (\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1) \u2208 P+ ,\nW ((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + l(\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1)) \u2243 St \u2297 L(l(\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1))\nis a projective and simple module [APW1], and therefore \u03c7((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + l(\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1)) *\nf (\u03b7) lies in the linear span of projective characters in C[P ]W for any \u03b7 \u2208 P . For\nnondominant weights, \u03c7((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + l(\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1)) is either zero or equals \u00b1\u03c7((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + l\u03bd)\nfor some \u03bd \u2208 P+ , and the Proposition follows.\nThus, both J and P r admit characterizations in terms of the symmetries with\nrespect to the shifted action of the affine Weyl group (cf. Corollary 2.2), and\nP r \u2282 J.\nProjective modules over Uqf in (g). Next we are interested in the restrictions of\nprojective modules to Uqf in (g). Below we formulate the known facts on projective\nmodules in C \u0304f .\nTheorem 3.5. [APW2]\n1. St is both projective and injective in C \u0304f .\n2. All injective modules in C \u0304f are projective, and vice versa.\n3. Keep the notations of Proposition 3.3. For each \u03bb \u2208 P+ , the restriction of\nT (\u03bb\u0304) to Uqf in (g) is injective and projective in C \u0304f .\n4. For each \u03bb0 \u2208 Pl , the restriction of T (\u03bb \u03040 ) to Uqf in (g) is isomorphic to the\ninjective hull of L(\u03bb0 ) in C \u0304f . In particular, any injective Uqf in (g)-module is\nthe restriction of an injective Uqres (g)-module.\n5. For each \u03bb \u2208 P+ , the restriction of T (\u03bb\u0304) to Uqf in (g) is isomorphic to the direct\nsum of dim(L(l\u03bb1 )) copies of T (\u03bb \u03040 ).\n \u0304 in the category of the restrictions of\nProjective modules form a tensor ideal Pr\nf in\ntilting modules to Uq (g), and the linear span of their characters is a multiplicative\nideal in R\u0304.\nProposition 3.6. Linear span of the characters of projective (injective) modules\nover Uqf in (g) coincides with\nchSt * C[P ]W \u2297C[lP ]W C.\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n12\n\nProof. This follows from Proposition 3.2 and the factorization of C[P ]W to the\nrestricted weights (Corollary 2.5).\nThe next theorem determines the dimension of P \u0304r \u2282 R\u0304:\nTheorem 3.7. The characters of projective modules over Uqf in (g) span the ideal\nof R\u0304 of the form\nP \u0304r = spanC {[St] * [f (\u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208X\u0302 ,\nwhere [f (\u03bb)] denotes the element mapped to f (\u03bb) under the isomorphism of Corollary 2.5, and X\u0302 is the fundamental domain for the W \u25e6-action in Pl .\nProof. Lemma 3.8. For any \u03bb \u2208 Pl , the characters of any two projective Uqf in (g)modules with no composition factors of highest weight outside the orbit {W \u2022 \u03bb},\nare proportional in R\u0304.\nProof. The radical of the algebra C[P ]W \u2297C[lP ]W C is spanned by the elements which\nannihilate K\u03bc for any \u03bc \u2208 Pl . It coincides with the linear span of the differences\nf (\u03bb) \u2212 f (z \u25e6 \u03bb),\nwhere z \u2208 W , \u03bb \u2208 Pl and we used the non-shifted \u25e6-action of W on the restricted\nweights. By [La], Lemma 5.3, the character of the Steinberg module [St] annihilates\nthe radical of R\u0304, and we have\nchSt * f (\u03bb) \u2212 chSt * f (z \u25e6 \u03bb) = 0\nfor any z \u2208 W , \u03bb \u2208 Pl .\nBy Proposition 3.6 any projective character with composition factors of highest\nweights in one orbit W \u2022 \u03bb can be written as a linear combination\nX\naz chSt * f (z \u25e6 \u03bb),\nz\u2208W\n\nfor some coefficients az \u2208 C, which by the above equals to\nX\n(\naz )chSt * f (\u03bb).\nz\u2208W\n\nThis shows that any two projective modules in the same block of the category C \u0304f\nhave equal characters up to a scalar multiple.\nBy Theorem 3.5, there exists at least one projective module in C \u0304f with composition factors of highest weights in each W \u2022-orbit in Pl . Characters of modules\nin different blocks of category C \u0304f are linearly independent in R\u0304, and we get the\nstatement of the Theorem.\nNote that by Lemma 3.8, the ideal of characters of projective modules over\nUqf in (g) is |X \u0304|-dimensional, where X \u0304 is the fundamental domain for the W \u2022-action\non Pl ( we have |X\u0302 | = |X \u0304|). Thus P \u0304r and V \u0304r have bases parametrized respectively\nby the weights in X \u0304 and X , the closed and open alcove of the W \u2022-action in Pl .\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n13\n\nClassification of tensor ideals in T . According to the main theorem in [Ost],\nthe partially ordered (by inclusion) set of tensor ideals in T is isomorphic to the\npartially ordered set of two-sided cells in the affine Weyl group \u0174l,Q . The partition\nof a Coxeter group G into a partially ordered set of two-sided cells was defined\nin [KL] to study the ideals in the group algebra of G, consistent with a special\n(Kazhdan-Lusztig) basis in G. In particular, for the affine Weyl group \u0174l,Q , the\nunit element {1} is the highest, and the set W(\u03bd) \u2282 \u0174l,Q - the lowest cell with\nrespect to this order [Lus3], [Bed], [Shi]. The cell W(\u03bd) has the following description\n[Shi]:\nW(\u03bd) = {w \u2208 \u0174l,Q : w = x * wI * y, for some x, y \u2208 \u0174l,Q , l(w) = l(x) + l(wI ) + l(y)},\nwhere wI is the longest element of a standard parabolic subgroup W I \u2282 \u0174l,Q ,\nisomorphic to W .\nThe correspondence in [Ost] can be described as follows. Let W f be the set\nof minimal length representatives of the cosets W \\\u0174l,Q . Then by [LX] for any\ntwo-sided cell c \u2208 \u0174l,Q , the intersection c \u2229 W f is nonempty. Let b = \u222ai ci \u2208 \u0174l,Q\ndenote the union of all two-sided cells with the condition that ci \u2264 c for each i with\nrespect to the partial order defined in [KL]. Then the full subcategory of T formed\nby the direct sums of tilting modules T (\u03bb) with \u03bb \u2208 (b \u2229 W f ) * X\u0304 is a tensor ideal\nin T corresponding to the cell c.\nProposition 3.9.\n1. The ideal T \u2032 \u2282 T corresponds to the complement of the\nhighest cell (\u0174l,Q \\ {1}) \u2282 \u0174l,Q ;\n2. The ideal Pr \u2282 T corresponds to the lowest cell W(\u03bd) \u2282 \u0174l,Q .\nProof. (1) was observed in [Ost]: for \u03bb \u2208 P+ we have \u03bb \u2208 (W f \\ {1}) * X\u0304 if and only\nif \u03bb \u2208 P+ \\ X, which coincides with the set of highest weights of tilting modules in\nT \u2032.\nFor (2), we can use the description of W(\u03bd) in [Bed]. For each pair of nearest\nparallel hyperplanes of affine reflections in P, define the strip U to be the set of\nweights between these hyperplanes, and let U denote the set of all strips in P . Then\nby [Bed],\nW(\u03bd) * X\u0304 = P \\ (\u222aU\u2208U :X\u2282U U ).\nTherefore, ((W(\u03bd) \u2229 W f ) * X\u0304) \u2229 P+ = P+ \u2229 (P \\ (\u222aU\u2208U :X\u2282U U )), which coincides with\nthe set (l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + P+ . This is exactly the set of highest weights of the projective\nmodules in T .\nThis means that F us and Pr can be thought of as the \"top\" and the \"bottom\"\nof the tensor category T . This relation also holds for their restrictions over Uqf in (g):\nCorollary 3.10. In the partially ordered (by inclusion) set of ideals in R\u0304 corresponding to the restrictions of tensor ideals in T , J \u0304 and P \u0304r are respectively the\nhighest and the lowest nontrivial elements.\nUnlike in case of the big quantum group Uqres (g), here the ideal P \u0304r is finite\ndimensional. The above argument then suggests that the ideal P \u0304r should be viewed\nin the same framework with the algebra V \u0304r, and, just as the Verlinde algebra, it\nshould play a special role in the representation theory of Uqf in (g). Further evidence\nof this similarity is presented in the next section.\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n14\n\n4. P \u0304r as an analog of the Verlinde algebra.\nIn this section we will consider the properties of P \u0304r in parallel to those of V r\nand its restriction to the small quantum group V \u0304r.\nWrite R\u0304 = \u2295\u03bc\u2208X\u0304 R\u0304\u03bc for the decomposition of the algebra R\u0304 into a direct sum\nof two-sided multiplicative ideals corresponding to the block decomposition of the\ncategory C \u0304f (Proposition 2.7). The structure of the block R\u0304\u03bc was described in [La]\nfollowing the result of [BG]:\nR\u0304\u03bc \u2243 C[P ]W\u03bc \u2297C[P ]W C,\nwhere W\u03bc is the subgroup of W stabilizing the weight \u03bc with respect to the \u2022action, and C[P ]W \u2212\u2192 C maps each el\u03b7 to 1.\nThe ideal P \u0304r has a clear interpretations in terms of the block structure of R\u0304.\nThe following statements can be derived from Theorem 3.7 and Lemma 3.8.\nCorollary 4.1.\nP \u0304r \u2243 Ann(Rad R\u0304).\nProof. The character of the Steinberg module annihilates the radical of R\u0304 and is\ntherefore an element of Ann(Rad R\u0304). Since [St] generates the algebra P \u0304r over R\u0304,\nany element of P \u0304r belongs to Ann(Rad R\u0304). Now compare the dimensions:\n|X \u0304 | = dim(P \u0304r) \u2264 dimAnn(Rad R\u0304) = |X \u0304 |,\nwhere the first equality holds by Theorem 3.7, and the last follows from the block\nstructure of R\u0304. Therefore, P \u0304r \u2243 Ann(Rad R\u0304).\nCorollary 4.2. The ideal P \u0304r is isomorphic to [St](R\u0304/Rad(R\u0304)), where the algebra\nR\u0304/Rad(R\u0304) is isomorphic to (V r)+ as defined in \u00a71:\n(V r)+ \u2243 C[P ]W /h(f (\u03bb) \u2212 f (s(\u03bb))i\u03bb\u2208P,s\u2212a reflection in \u0174l,P\nProof. Follows from the definition of W \u25e6 action on Pl . Note that here in the\ndefinition of the ideal, a reflection s \u2208 \u0174l,P can be replaced by any element w \u2208\n\u0174l,P .\nChoose the set of representatives X\u02c6 for the orbits of W \u25e6 in Pl so that X\u02c6 \u2282 X,\nby taking the smallest weight in each orbit.\nProposition 4.3. For any \u03bb \u2208 X\u0302 \u2282 X, the character of the projective module\nP ((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + \u03bb) equals to chSt * f (\u03bb) in C[P ]W .\nProof. By Proposition 3.2, the character of P ((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + \u03bb) in C[P ]W can be written\nas\nX\nchP ((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + \u03bb) = a\u03bb chSt * f (\u03bb) + chSt\na\u03bc f (\u03bc)\n\u03bc<\u03bb\n\nfor some coefficients a\u03bc \u2208 C. As a character of an indecomposable projective module\nover Uqres (g), it contains only Weyl characters with highest weights in \u0174l,Q *\u03bb. This\nrequires \u03bc \u2208 W \u25e6 \u03bb, which cannot be satisfied for \u03bc < \u03bb, \u03bb \u2208 X\u0302 . Therefore, we have\nthat chP ((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + \u03bb) is proportional to chSt * f (\u03bb), and the normalization can be\nchecked by evaluating the corresponding characters at 1.\nFor any \u03bb \u2208 X\u02c6 chosen as above, let [P (\u03bb)] denote the character of the restriction\nof the projective Uqres (g)-module P ((l \u2212 1)\u03c1 + \u03bb) to Uqf in (g). Then {[P (\u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208X\u0302\nform a basis in P \u0304r.\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\n15\n\nCorollary 4.4. For any \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 X\u0302 , we have in R\u0304\nX\n[P (\u03bb)] * [P (\u03bc)] = [St] *\nn\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc [P (\u03bd)],\n\u03bd\u2208X\u0302\n\nwhere n\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc are the structure constants of the algebra (V r)+ in the basis of elementary W -symmetric functions\nX\nf (\u03bb) * f (\u03bc) =\nn\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc f (\u03bd).\n\u03bd\u2208X\u0302\n\nProof. Proposition 4.3 implies that we have \u03c8\u0304([P (\u03bb)]) = \u03c8\u0304([St]) * f (\u03bb) in\n(C[P ]W \u2297C[lP ]W C) for all \u03bb \u2208 X\u02c6 , and we know that \u03c8\u0304([St]) = chSt is given by the\nWeyl character formula. Multiplication gives\nX\nchSt2 f (\u03bb)f (\u03bc) = chSt2\nn\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc f\u03bd .\n\u03bd\u2208X\u0302\n\nAll characters of projective Uqf in (g)-modules in one W \u2022-orbit are proportional, and\nX\u0302 is the fundamental domain for W \u25e6-action which corresponds to the W \u2022-action\nafter multiplication by chSt. Therefore, for each \u03bd \u2208 X\u0302 there exists a unique\nprojective character [P (\u03bd)] \u2208 R\u0304 such that \u03c8\u0304([P (\u03bd)]) = chSt * f (\u03bd), and using the\nalgebra isomorphism \u03c8\u0304, we obtain the Corollary.\nTo summarize, we note that \"modulo [St]\" the ideal P \u0304r has the structure of\na semisimple commutative algebra of dimension |X\u0302 |, which is isomorphic to the\nalgebra R\u0304/Rad(R\u0304) \u2243 Head(R\u0304) (R\u0304 is a Frobenius algebra), and admits a natural\nbasis of W -symmetric functions f (\u03bb), \u03bb \u2208 X\u02c6, with each f (\u03bb) corresponding to an\nindividual character of an indecomposable projective module.\nTo compare, we have for V r:\nX\n[W (\u03bb)][W (\u03bc)] =\na\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc [W (\u03bd)],\nwhere [W (\u03bb)], [W (\u03bc)] \u2208 R are characters of Weyl modules of highest weights \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208\nX, and a\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc are the structure constants of the algebra (V r)\u2212 as defined in \u00a71.\nNow suppose that l > h is even. Then folowing [AP], it is possible to define just\nas before the big quantum group Uqres (g)ev , the category of tilting modules, the\nfusion category and the Verlinde algebra V rev . An important property of the V rev\nis the existence on it of a representation of the modular group. Define chq W (\u03bb) to\nbe a functional on Uqres (g)ev , equal on an element x \u2208 Uqres (g) to the trace of K2\u03c1 x\nover the Weyl module W (\u03bb). Then the linear span of {chq W (\u03bb)}\u03bb\u2208X carries a\nprojective representation of the modular group (see e.g. [Lyu2], [BK]).

Let v denote the\ninvertible central element in Uqres (g)ev such that v 2 = u\u03b3(u), where u = (\u03b3 \u2297\nid)(R21 ) and \u03b3 is the antipode of Uqres (g)ev . Denote by Tss : {chq W (\u03bb)}\u03bb\u2208X \u2192\n{chq W (\u03bb)}\u03bb\u2208X the mapping which sends p(*) to p(v*). Then by [BK], Fss and Tss\n2\nsatisfy the modular identity: (Fss Tss )3 = cFss\n, where c \u2208 C is a constant.\nBy [Dr], the algebra of q-characters of finite dimensional modules over Uqres (g)ev\nis isomorphic to the complexified Grothendieck ring of the category of finite dimensional modules, with the isomorphism \u03b8 : p(*) \u2192 p((K\u22122\u03c1 *) sending chq W (\u03bb) to\n\u03c7(\u03bb). Then the maps Fss = \u03b8 \u25e6 Fss \u25e6 \u03b8\u22121 , Tss = Tss define a modular group action\non V rev .\nBack to the situation when l > h is odd and coprime to the determinant of the\nCartan matrix of g, we observe that the ideal P \u0304r is invariant under the quantum\nFourier transform Fq , which is a slight modification of the one introduced in [LM].\nThis easily extends to a projective representation of the modular group.\nDefine the algebra R\u0304r of q \u22121 -characters as a subalgebra of Uqf in (g)\u2217 generated\nby {chq\u22121 W (\u03bb)}\u03bb\u2208Pl , where chq\u22121 W (\u03bb) is a functional on Uqf in (g), equal on an\nelement x \u2208 Uqf in (g) to the trace of K\u22122\u03c1 x over the module W (\u03bb). Then the map\n\u03b8 : p(*) \u2192 p((K\u22122\u03c1 *) provides an isomorphism of commutative algebras \u03b8 : R\u0304 \u2192 R\u0304r .\nFor p \u2208 R\u0304r the element (p \u2297 id)((R\u030421 R\u030412 )) is central in Uqf in (g) [Dr]. Let \u03bbr denote\nthe right integral of Uqf in (g)\u2217 , which is unique up to a scalar multiple. Then we\nhave\nProposition 4.5. Let Fq denote the map\nFq (p) =\n\nX\n\n(\u03bbr )(1) ((\u03b3\u0304)(p \u2297 id)(R\u030421 R\u030412 ))(\u03bbr )(2) ,\n\n(\u03bbr )\n\nwhere \u03b3\u0304 is the antipode in Uqf in (g). Then Fq maps Ann(Rad R\u0304r ) bijectively to\nitself.\nThis is equivalent to Theorem 5.2 in [La]. By [Lyu1], Uqf in (g) contains the ribbon\nelement v\u0304, which belongs to the center Z \u2282 Uqf in (g). Define the mapping Tq : R\u0304r \u2192\nR\u0304r by the action of the ribbon element v\u0304 \u2208 Uqf in (g), p(*) \u2192 p(v\u0304*). By [La], there\nexists a homomorphism \u03c6 : Z \u2192 R\u0304r of Z-modules such that \u03c6\u22121 (Ann(Rad R\u0304r )) \u2282\nAnn(Rad Z). Therefore, any central element acts in Ann(Rad R\u0304r ) as multiplication\nby a scalar. Then Tq preserves Ann(Rad R\u0304r ), and is nondegenerate since it is\nnondegenerate on R\u0304r . Then by [Lyu1], the mappings Fq , Tq satisfy the modular\nidentities, and therefore Fq \u2261 \u03b8\u22121 \u25e6 Fq \u25e6 \u03b8 together with Tq \u2261 Tq defines a modular\ngroup action on P \u0304r.\nRemark. We used the algebra of q \u22121 -characters here to make it consistent with [La];\nstarting with the quantum Fourier transform defined on the span of q-characters\nwould lead to the same mapping Fq on P \u0304r.\nBelow we list the properties of V r and P \u0304r.\n\n\fA COUNTERPART OF THE VERLINDE ALGEBRA\n\nVr\n\nP \u0304r\n\nV r \u2243 (V r)\u2212 \u2243 C[P ]W /J, where\nJ = h(\u03c7(\u03bb) + \u03c7(s * \u03bb)i\u03bb\u2208P,refl. s\u2208\u0174l,Q\n\nP \u0304r \u2243 (chSt)(V r)+ \u2243 (chSt)C[P ]W /I,\nwhere I = h(f (\u03bb) \u2212 f (s(\u03bb))i\u03bb\u2208P,s\u2208\u0174l,P ;\n\nV r has a basis {[W (\u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208X\n\nP \u0304r has a basis {[St] * [f (\u03bb)]}\u03bb\u2208X\u0302\n\ndim(V r) = |X|, the number\nof regular blocks in R\n\ndim(P \u0304r) = |X\u0302 | = |X\u0304 |, the number\nof all blocks in R\u0304\n\nV r is the algebra of characters of the\nfusion category F us over Uqres (g).\n\nP \u0304r is the ideal of characters of\nprojective modules over Uqf in (g).\n\n17\n\nFor even l, V rev carries a representation For odd l, P \u0304r carries a representation\nof the modular group given by (Fss , Tss ) of the modular group given by (Fq , Tq )\n\nReferences\n[AJS] H.H.Andersen, J.C.Jantzen, W.Soergel, Representations of quantum groups at p-th root of\nunity and of semisimple groups in characteristic p: independence of p, Ast\u00e9risque 220 (1994)\n[And] H.H.Andersen, Tensor products of quantized tilting modules, Comm.
