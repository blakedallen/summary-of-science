Introduction\nFor more than sixty years, the predictions based on the analysis of the Ginzburg-Landau\n(GL) equations [1] for the order parameter \u03a8(r), supercurrent density j(r) and magnetic\nfield B\n1\n(\u2212i~\u2207 \u2212 qA)2 \u03a8 + \u03b2 |\u03a8|2 \u03a8 + \u03b1\u03a8 = 0\n(1a)\n2m\nq2\nq~\n(\u03a8\u2217 \u2207\u03a8 \u2212 \u03a8\u2207\u03a8\u2217 ) \u2212 A |\u03a8|2\n(1b)\nj=i\n2m\nm\n\u2207 \u00d7 B = \u03bcj,\n(1c)\nhave been in a very good agreement with the experiment [2\u20134]. In the above equations,\nm is a mass of a superconducting carrier, q is its negative charge, \u03bc is a magnetic\npermeability, A is a vector potential through which the magnetic field is expressed\naccording to\nB = \u2207 \u00d7 A,\nand \u03b1 and \u03b2 > 0 are GL parameters. Developed several years later microscopic BardeenCooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory [5\u20137] had shown that the superconducting quantum\n(commonly called after this a Cooper pair) is actually two electrons bounded to each\nother by their interaction via phonons with its total mass being equal to the double\nelectron mass me , m = 2me , and negative charge of the double elementary charge e,\nq = \u22122|e|. In fact, the choice of mass in the above equations is arbitrary [6] while the\ndouble negative charge reflects a fundamental fact of pairing of the two electrons with\nthe opposite spins [6]. It is postulated that the density ns (r) of the superconducting\nelectrons is determined by the order parameter \u03a8(r) according to\nns (r) = |\u03a8 (r)|2 /2.\n\n(2)\n\nThe expressions for the GL coefficients can be derived from the microscopic theory of\nsuperconductivity [7, 8]:\n~2\n2m\u03be 2 (T )\n\u0014\n\u00152\n1\n~2\n1\n\u03b2=\n.\n2\nN (0) 2m\u03be (0) (kB Tc )2\n\u03b1= \u2212\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nHere, N(0) is the density of states at the Fermi energy, kB is Planck constant, Tc is\na bulk critical temperature of superconductor, and \u03be(T ) is a coherence length varying\nwith the temperature T as\nr\nTc\n.\n(5)\n\u03be (T ) = \u03be (0)\nTc \u2212 T\nIt means that the cubicity \u03b2 does not depend on the temperature while the coefficient \u03b1\nlinearly grows with it, \u03b1 \u223c (T \u2212 Tc ). For the 'dirty' metals (alloys), the value of \u03be 2 (0) in\n(3) and (4) has to be replaced by \u03be(0)l with l being the mean free path of the material\n[6, 7, 9].\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n3\n\nFor the spatially confined samples, equations (1) have to be supplemented by\nthe boundary conditions at the superconductor three dimensional (3D) surface, or 2D\ncontour, or 1D interval S. For the order parameter, de Gennes proposed to use the\nfollowing requirement [6]:\n\u0010\n1\nq \u0011\n(6)\nn \u2207\u2212i A \u03a8 = \u03a8\n~\n\u039b S\nS\nwith n being an inward unit vector normal to the interface. Analysis of (1b) and (6)\nmanifests that the real value of the extrapolation length (or the de Gennes distance, as\nit is customarily called on the superconductor slang) \u039b guarantees that no supercurrent\nflows through the confining surface\u2021:\nnj|Im(\u039b)=0 \u2261 0.\n\n(7)\n\nNumerical magnitude of \u039b characterizes the intensity of the interaction of the\nsuperconductor with the ambient environment and, as a consequence of this, the\npenetration of the order parameter into it; in particular, for the border with the\nvacuum or the insulator its approaches infinity, takes finite positive values for the\ncontact with the normal nonsuperconducting metal and turns to zero while bordering\nthe magnetic material. Utilizing BCS equations, it can be shown that, for example, for\nthe superconductor half-space terminated at x = 0, the fading propagation of the order\nparameter into the neighbouring medium at x < 0 is described as [12, 13]\n1\n(8)\n\u03a8 (x) \u223c e\u2212|x|/\u039b , x \u226a 0.\n\u039b\nNote that, according to (8), the Cooper pairs can penetrate neither into the vacuum,\n\u039b = \u221e, (what is natural) nor into the magnetics, \u039b = 0, as expected, since the\nspins of all charged carriers in the magnetic material are forced to align in the\nsame direction while in the Cooper pair the spins of each constituent electron are\nantiparallel. Interestingly, for the border with the other superconductor with higher\nTc the extrapolation length takes negative values what physically means a surface\nenhancement of the superconductivity. This boundary-induced increase of the critical\ntemperature was indeed observed in cold worked In0.993 Bi0.007 foils [14] and tin samples\n[15, 16]. For the former study it was estimated from the increase of the critical\ntemperature that the negative extrapolation length is in the order of micron [17], \u039b \u2248 \u22121\n\u03bcm, while for the latter case it was argued that the magnitude of the de Gennes distance\ncan be controlled by, for example, manipulating the abrasive grain size and the annealing\ntime and temperature [15]. Another method of varying the extrapolation length was\nproposed recently from the calculation of the influence of the external electric field E on\nsuperconductors; namely, it was argued [18, 19] that its application perpendicular to the\ninterface transforms the zero-field de Gennes distance \u039b|E=0 into its total counterpart\n\u039btot :\n1\nE\n1\n=\n(9)\n+\n\u039btot\n\u039b E=0 Us\n\u2021 Resonant features of the supercurrent j crossing the interface S for the nonzero imaginary part of \u039b\nhave been predicted recently [10, 11] in the framework of linearized GL equations.\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n4\n\nwith the voltage Us being expressed through the parameters of the GL theory:\n1 \u223c 2 \u2202 ln Tc q\u01ebs\n.\n(10)\n=\u03ba\nUs\n\u2202 ln ns mc2\nHere, dimensionless GL parameter \u03ba is the ratio of the zero-temperature London\npenetration length \u03bb(0) to the coherence length, \u03ba = \u03bb(0)/\u03be(0); \u01ebs is superconductor\nionic background permittivity, and c is the speed of light. While for the classical (low-Tc )\nmaterials with the small \u03ba the magnitude of Us reaches high values of \u223c 106 V, for the\nhigh-Tc superconductors with the large GL parameter, \u03ba \u223c 100, it drops significantly to\nthe value of several tens of volts [18].\nIn the absence of the magnetic fields, equations (1a) and (6) simplify to\n~2\n\u2206\u03a8 + \u03b2 |\u03a8|2 \u03a8 + \u03b1\u03a8 = 0\n2m\n1\nn\u2207\u03a8|S = \u03a8 .\n\u039b S\n\n\u2212\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nRemarkably, equation (11) is formally identical to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describing\nthe motion of the quantum particle with the energy\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT\n~2\n1\u2212\n(13)\nE \u2261 \u2212\u03b1 =\n2m\u03be 2 (0)\nTc\n\nin the domain confined by the surface S with the effective potential Vef f (r) of the form\nVef f (r) = \u03b2 |\u03a8(r)|2 .\n\n(14)\n\nFrom (13) one sees that getting the lowest eigenvalue Emin of the energy is equivalent\nto finding the temperature T of the sample:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2m\u03be 2 (0)\nT = Tc 1 \u2212 Emin\n.\n(15)\n~2\nThus, a solution of the problem of the maximal possible minimization of Emin shows the\nway of increasing T . The procedure of determining the temperature through the lowest\neigenenergy Emin of (1a) and/or (11) is widely used in the superconductor research\n[6, 20] and will be implemented below too. Note that the effective potential Vef f (r) is\nalways nonnegative and, accordingly, taking into account of the cubic term leads to the\ndecrease of the temperature T from (15). This has a natural physical explanation:\nthe superconducting carriers density ns , which is proportional to the square order\nparameter too, grows with the decrease of the temperature and, accordingly, the role of\nthe nonlinear term becomes more prominent as well.\nArmed with the experimental and theoretical knowledge discovered during last\nfifteen-twenty years, we readdress here the problem of the GL description of the\nproperties of the straight superconducting film in the absence of the magnetic fields,\nB = 0, partially discussed in the mid 1960s [13] and in 1993 [21, 22]. Even though some\nbasic equations for this geometry have been derived before, their analysis in the just\ncited references was limited to the linear case and nonnegative \u039b only. In particular,\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n5\n\nit was shown that the critical film width dc at which the superconductivity emerges,\ndepends on \u039b as [13, 21, 23]\n\u03be (T )\n.\n(16)\n\u039b\nLinearized GL theory at the negative \u039b was also discussed recently for the same\nconfiguration [17, 24\u201326]. Below, we provide a complete analysis of the temperature\nT dependence on the cubicity \u03b2, superdensity ns and the extrapolation length \u039b. For\nachieving this, we analytically solve (11) with the GL coefficient \u03b1 substituted by the\nenergy E, equation (13), and, after imposing on its eigenfunction boundary condition\n(12), arrive at the transcendental equation for the calculation of the eigenvalue Emin ,\nwhich, according to (15), defines the film temperature T . Our primary interest is an\ninvestigation of the combined influence of the extrapolation length \u039b and cubicity \u03b2 on\nthe temperature T . It appears that the crucial role in this case is played also by the\ndensity ns . Special attention is paid to the case of the negative de Gennes distance when,\nas it is proved below, the increasing cubicity promotes the energy from the negative area\nto the positive values for one specific density ns only. Critical negative extrapolation\nlength \u039b0 at which the energy turns to zero, is calculated analytically as a function of\n\u03b2 and its mathematical and physical analysis is performed.\nThe results are presented in the following outline. In section 2, a necessary\nformalism applied to the study of the straight GL strip is derived along with several of\nits asymptotic cases some of which have been known before. Results of the calculations\nfor the positive and negative extrapolation lengths are presented separately in section 3.\nThe discussion is wrapped up in section 4 by some concluding remarks.\ndc = 2\u03be (T ) arctan\n\n2.

Origin of the Cartesian\nsystem of coordinates coincides with the middle of the film and the horizontal x axis is\nperpendicular to its edges. Left (right) confining surface is characterized by the uniform\nalong the interface de Gennes length \u039b\u2212 (\u039b+ ). Frequently used method in the study\nof the superconducting\npsystems implements the scaling where the order parameter \u03a8 is\nexpressed in units\np of \u03b2/|\u03b1| and all distances are measured in units of the coherence\nlength \u03be(T ) = ~2 /(2m|\u03b1|) [6, 7, 21]. Advantage of such an approach lies in the fact that\nno any coefficients appear in the resulting differential GL equation and the eigenvalue\ntranscendental relationship does contain the film width d [21]. However, shortcomings\nof this method are a continuation of its strong sides; namely, by eliminating the physical\nparameters from the GL equation, such scaling shadows the explicit interrelations\nbetween them and at the final stage one needs to return again to the units where\nthese quantities re-emerge what, due to the quite complicated structure of the derived\ndependencies, is not an easy task to do [21]. For example, in this approach the parameter\n\u03b2 is dropped out from the integration constants of the GL equation and, accordingly,\nit is not clear how to explicitly obtain the influence of its magnitude on the properties\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n6\n\nof the superconductor and to track the transformation from the linear to the cubic\nscenario. Since in the present research we are interested in the temperature dependence\non, among other parameters, the cubicity \u03b2, we employ the scaling where the distances\nare measured in units of the film width d, which is the only natural (temperature\nindependent) length for the geometry under consideration. Accordingly, the energy E\nthrough which the temperature T is expressed according to (15), will be measured in\nunits of the ground state energy \u03c0 2 ~2 /(2md2 ) of the 1D Dirichlet well of the width d,\nand cubicity \u03b2 will be expressed in units of d2 . In this way, the temperature T (via\nthe energy E) and cubicity \u03b2 explicitly stay in the differential equation and enter its\nsolution and the resulting transcendental equation what allows to directly investigate\nthe correlations between these two parameters.\nIn the absence of the magnetic field, B = 0, the motion along each of the axes is\nindependent from the movement along the other ones. Mathematically, this separation\nof the transverse and two longitudinal motions in the film is expressed via the following\nansatz:\n\u03a8 (x, y, z) = ei(ky y+kz z) \u03c7 (x) .\n\n(17)\n\nAfter substitution of (17) into (11) one arrives at the differential equation for the\ntransverse function \u03c7(x):\n\u0001\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (x) + \u03c0 2 E \u2212 ky2 \u2212 kz2 \u03c7 (x) \u2212 \u03b2\u03c73 (x) = 0.\n(18)\n\nThe designations of the absolute values in the cubic term have been dropped out from\n(18) since it is known that even in the presence of the magnetic fields a solution of the\nGL equations in the simply connected region can be chosen real [7]. As we are interested\nin the lowest possible value of the energy that, according to (15), guarantees the highest\nattainable temperature T , we put ky and kz equal to zero to obtain:\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (x) + \u03c0 2 E\u03c7 (x) \u2212 \u03b2\u03c73 (x) = 0.\n\n(19)\n\nSecond-order nonlinear differential equation (19) is supplemented by the two boundary\nconditions at the film edges:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n\u2032\n= 0.\n(20)\n\u03c7 (x)\n\u03c7 (x) \u00b1\n\u039b\u00b1\nx=\u00b11/2\nBelow, for simplicity, we will use the same extrapolation lengths at the opposite surfaces,\n\u039b+ \u2261 \u039b\u2212 \u2261 \u039b.\n\nwith\n\n(21)\n\nGeneral solution to (19) reads:\nr\n2\n\u03c7 (x) =\n\u03b7\u03b6 sn(\u03b6x + C, \u03b7)\n\u03b2\n\u03b7 \u2261 \u03b7 (E, \u03b2, k) =\n\u03b6 \u2261 \u03b6 (E, \u03b7) =\n\ns\n\ns\n\n\u03b2\n2\u03c0 2 E\n\n\u03c02E\n.\n1 + \u03b72\n\n\u2212\u03b2\n\n(22)\n\nk,\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n7\n\nHere, sn(u, k) is a Jacobi elliptic sine [27, 28], the integration factor k is determined by\n(or, vice versa, determines) the density ns of the Cooper pairs, as it directly follows\nfrom comparison between (22), (23) and (2), and the coefficient C is found from the\nsymmetry properties of the film; namely, for the equal de Gennes lengths, equation\n(21), one has either even, \u03c7ev (\u2212x) = \u03c7ev (x), or odd, \u03c7odd (\u2212x) = \u2212\u03c7odd (x), solutions.\nRecalling properties of the elliptic functions [27\u201329], one immediately gets:\nCev = K(\u03b7)\n\n(25a)\n\nCodd = 0,\n\n(25b)\n\nwhere K(k) is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind [27\u201329]. Accordingly, the\norder parameter becomes\nr\n2\n\u03b7\u03b6 cd(\u03b6x, \u03b7)\n(26a)\n\u03c7ev (x) =\n\u03b2\nr\n2\n\u03b7\u03b6 sn(\u03b6x, \u03b7)\n(26b)\n\u03c7odd (x) =\n\u03b2\n\nwith cd(u, k) being another Jacobi elliptic function (we follow commonly adopted [27\u2013\n30] Glaisher designations [31, 32]). Applying boundary conditions (20) to the transverse\nfunction \u03c7(x), one arrives at\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b6 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 sn(\u03b6/2, \u03b7) \u2212 cn(\u03b6/2, \u03b7) dn(\u03b6/2, \u03b7) = 0\n(27a)\n\u039b\nfor the even states, and\n1\n(27b)\n\u03b6cn(\u03b6/2, \u03b7) dn(\u03b6/2, \u03b7) + sn(\u03b6/2, \u03b7) = 0\n\u039b\nfor the odd ones with cn(u, k) and dn(u, k) being another two major elliptic functions\n[27\u201329]. These equations determine energy E as a function of the de Gennes distance \u039b\nand, through the factor \u03b7, of the cubicity \u03b2 and parameter k: E \u2261 E (\u039b, \u03b2, k). It is the\naim of the next chapter to analyze these dependencies for the positive, zero and negative\nextrapolation lengths. Since the lowest energy level determining, according to (15),\nthe temperature T of the sample, is always even, below mainly this case is discussed.\nIt is important to state that the mathematics involved in the derivation of (26) and\n(27) automatically introduces another important physical parameter; namely, it is the\nintegration constant k that plays, as we shall see below, a crucial role in determining\ntemperature of the film and a square of which, as pointed out above, represents the\ndensity ns . Note that the coefficients \u03b2 and k are not completely independent, as\nit directly follows from (23), (24) and (27); for example, if either of them is zero,\nequations (27) do not depend on the second one. Mathematically, this is explained by\nthe dependence of the effective potential Vef f (x) from (14) on k via the order parameter\n\u03c7(x). This has a clear physical meaning too; namely, for the linear case, \u03b2 = 0, the\ndensity of the superconducting pairs is vanishingly small [6] what corresponds to the\ncoefficient k tending to zero, k \u2192 0, and, as a result, it is dropped out from (27). Below\nwe will interchangeably operate with the factor \u03b7 or the parameters \u03b2 and k keeping in\nmind that, if required, the coefficient k, for example, for each given \u03b2 can be determined\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n8\n\nfrom (23) after finding a solution E of equations (27). Utilizing properties of the Jacobi\nelliptic functions [27, 29, 30], it can be shown that the transformation \u03b7 \u2192 1/\u03b7 leaves\n(27b) intact while its even counterpart (27a) changes sign of \u039b what means that it is\nsufficient to consider the unit interval\n0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1.\n\n(28)\n\nAt its right edge, equation (27a) becomes:\n4 1\n(29)\nueu =\n\u039b 1 \u2212 \u03b72\np\nwit u = \u03c0 E/2 and, thus, the energy E in this limit is expressed via the Lambert W\nfunction [33]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2 2 4 1\n, \u03b7 \u2192 1.\n(30)\nE = 2W\n\u03c0\n\u039b 1 \u2212 \u03b72\n\nAlternatively, one can use an iterative solution of (29) diverging to infinity as\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2 2\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u039b\n2\n2\n2\nE = 2 ln \u2212\n1 \u2212 \u03b7 ln \u2212\n1 \u2212 \u03b7 ln\n1\u2212\u03b7\n, \u03b7 \u2192 1,\n(31)\n\u03c0\n4\n4\n4\n\u0001\nwhere the number of the nested terms \u2212 \u039b4 (1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 ) ln \u2212 \u039b4 (1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 ) ln(. . .) can be\nincreased or decreased due to the desired precision. Expansion (31) also follows\nstraightforwardly from the asymptotic properties of the Lambert W function [33]. Of\ncourse, in reality the energy grows until the temperature T from (15) turns to zero. In\nterms of \u03b2 and k, the leading, \u039b-independent coefficient of (31) can be deduced directly\nfrom (23):\n\n1 + k2\n\u03b2, k or/and \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\n(32)\n2\u03c0 2\nThe corresponding order parameter tends then to the \u03b2-independent constant:\nr\n1 + k2\n\u03c7(x) =\n, k or/and \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\n(33)\n2\nNote that at k = 1 and very large nonlinearities, (32) and (33) constitute a solution\nof the initial normalized GL equation (19) for the bulk superconductor when no any\nboundaries are present:\n\u03b2\nE|k=1 \u2192 2 , \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e,\n(34a)\n\u03c0\n\u03c7(x)|k=1 = 1, \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\n(34b)\nE\u2192\n\nThis means that the effective potential (14) is so large in this limit that the confinement\nof the strip can not alter it. Equations (34) also show that the density with k = 1 is\na special one what will be vividly demonstrated for the negative de Gennes distances,\nsubsection 3.2.\nIn the opposite limit of the zero \u03b7 one arrives at the equations defining energies\nE in the linear regime [25, 26, 34], as expected. Other analytical asymptotics of the\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n9\n\nabove equations is the case of the Neumann boundary condition, 1/\u039b = 0, when the\nground-state energy is an identical zero for any \u03b2 and k, as it follows directly from (27a):\nE(\u039b = \u221e, \u03b2, k) \u2261 0.\n\n(35)\n\nIt means that for the Neumann strip the critical temperature does not depend on the\ncubicity of the GL equation and on the density of the superconducting carriers and is\nalways equal to the bulk critical temperature Tc . As a final remark of this section, let\nus note that if p\none chooses as a unit of length \u221a\nnot the strip width d but the coherence\n2\nthen the changes \u03c0 2 E \u2192 d in the first argument of the\nlength \u03be(T ) = ~ /(2mE),\n\u221a\nelliptic functions and \u03c0 2 E \u2192 1 in all other appearances in (27) of the parameter \u03b6\nfrom (24) allows one to find the critical width dc as a function of the de Gennes distance\n\u039b and factor \u03b7 [21]. However, compared to the normalization implemented by us above,\nthe cubicity \u03b2 in such scaling does disappear from the corresponding equations since\nthe role of the primary parameter in this case is played not by k but directly by \u03b7 that\nemerges as a result of the integration of the coefficient-free GL equation [21]\n\u03c7\u0303\u2032\u2032 (x) + \u03c7\u0303 (x) \u2212 \u03c7\u03033 (x) = 0,\nwhere the tilde denotes that the order parameter is measured in units of\n\n(36)\np\n\n\u03b2/|\u03b1| [21].\n\n3. Results and discussion\nHere, the results of the calculations based on the theory developed in the previous\nsection are presented and analysed from the mathematical and physical points of view.\nSince the obtained dependencies are different for the opposite signs of the de Gennes\ndistance, the cases of \u039b \u2265 0 and \u039b < 0 are considered separately.\n3.1. Zero and positive extrapolation lengths\nFigure 1 shows energy E as a function of the parameter \u03b7 and positive de Gennes distance\n\u039b. Similar to the linear configuration [26], for all nonzero \u03b7 the energy decreases with\nthe growth of the extrapolation length until in the Neumann limit, 1/\u039b = 0, one gets\nthe critical temperature of the film equal to its bulk counterpart, as it was stated in the\nprevious section, equation (35). In turn, the growth of \u03b7 pushes the energy upwards\nand at \u03b7 \u2192 1 one sees the divergence described by (30) and/or (31) with its steepness\nbeing larger for the smaller \u039b.\nEvolution of the order parameter is shown in figure 2 where the panel (a) exhibits\n\u03c7(x) with varying the de Gennes distance at the fixed \u03b7 = 0.5. Similar dependencies\nare characteristic for the other factors \u03b7 too. For the Dirichlet case, \u039b = 0, due to the\nsuppression of the order parameter at the edges, the nucleation of the superconductivity\ntakes place in the middle of the strip. Growing extrapolation length allows the Cooper\npairs to approach the interfaces with the corresponding decrease of the slope of the order\nparameter in the transverse direction, and, at the large \u039b, the function \u03c7(x) almost does\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n10\n\n8\n\nE\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n0.8\n\n2\n\n0.6\n\n3\n\n0.4\n4\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.

At \u03b7 approaching unity, the energy tends to infinity according to (31).\n\nnot depend on x what means a uniform nucleation of the superconductivity across the\nfilm.\nPanels (b) and (c) of figure 2 provide a comparative analysis of the influence of the\nfactor \u03b7 on the order parameter at the two extreme values of the extrapolation length:\nsmall, \u039b = 0, panel (b), and very large, \u039b = 100, panel (c). In either case, the symmetric\nfunction \u03c7(x) unrestrictedly grows when \u03b7 approaches unity. However, the \u03c7-shape for\nthe Dirichlet case is much more convex as compared to the de Gennes distances close\nto the Neumann one, 1/\u039b \u223c 0, when, as panel (c) demonstrates, the order parameter\nstays flat with its magnitude close to zero for almost all values of \u03b7 and starts to grow\nupwards only in the very neighbourhood of \u03b7 = 1. The larger the de Gennes distance\nis, the sharper the rise is at the right edge of the interval from (28).\nAccording to (23), the index \u03b7 accommodates two variables \u03b2 and k. To illustrate\ntheir separate influence on the temperature T , we plot in panel (a) of figure 3 the\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\na\n\n11\n\n1.6\n\n( )\n\n1.2\n\n=0.5\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.50\n\n5\n\n0.25\n\n4\n3\n\n0.00\n\n2\n-0.25\n\n1\n0\n\nb\n\nx)\n(\n\n-0.50\n\n=0\n\n( )\n\n6\n\nx\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\n-0.50\n-0.25\n\nx\n\n0.4\n\n0.00\n\n0.2\n0.25\n0.50\n\n0.0\n\nc\n\n( )\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n=100\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\n-0.50\n-0.25\n\nx\n\n0.4\n\n0.00\n\n0.2\n0.25\n0.50\n\n0.0\n\nFigure 2. Order parameter \u03c7(x) [normalized to (2/\u03b2)1/2 ] as a function of (a) the de\nGennes length \u039b for \u03b7 = 0.5, and of the parameter \u03b7 for (b) \u039b = 0 and (c) \u039b = 100.\nNote different vertical scale in panel (a) as compared to panels (b) and (c).\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n12\n\nenergy E in terms of these two factors for the extrapolation lengths \u039b = 0 and \u039b = 1.\nIt is seen that, as discussed in the previous section, for the zero value of either \u03b2 or k\nthe temperature does not depend on the second parameter. The energy increases and,\naccordingly, the temperature T decreases with the growth of \u03b2 or/and k for any finite\nde Gennes distance. As stated in the Introduction, the temperature dependence on the\ncubicity is explained by the positiveness of the effective potential Vef f (x), equation (14).\nIn other words, the role of the nonlinearity increases with the temperature decreasing.\nThe energy growth with the factor k is due to the fact that the decreasing temperature\nT leads to the increase of the density of the Cooper pairs that, as it follows from (2),\n(22) and (23), is determined, among other parameters, by k. As the calculations show,\nthe rate of the energy growth along the positive k direction exceeds the one along the\n\u03b2 axis:\n\u2202E\n\u2202E\n>\n.\n(37)\n\u2202k\n\u2202\u03b2\nThese two speeds of the energy change grow bigger with k and \u03b2.\nAs stated in the previous paragraph, the cubicity plays more prominent role when\nthe temperature decreases. A natural question arises: when does this role become so\ndominant that the linear theory could not be applied and its predictions are not close\nanymore to the results obtained from the cubic GL equation? Practical importance\nof this problem lies in the fact that obtaining the solution of the linear equation is,\ngenerally, much easier than its cubic counterpart. To answer this question, in panels\n(b)-(d) of figure 3 the energy is plotted in terms of the extrapolation length \u039b and\ncubicity \u03b2 at several parameters k. It is seen that for the small densities, say, k = 0.1 in\npanel (b), the energy only weakly depends on the cubicity and, accordingly, the linear\ntheory serves as a reliable substitution of the cubic GL equation in a wide range of the\nparameter \u03b2. This is especially true for the Dirichlet case, since the energy change with\nthe cubicity decreases for the smaller de Gennes distances:\n\u2202\n\u2202\nE(\u039b1 , \u03b2, k) >\nE(\u039b2 , \u03b2, k) , \u039b1 > \u039b2 \u2265 0.\n(38)\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b2\nGrowing density ns leads to the increase of the slope of the E-\u03b2 characteristics, as a\ntransition from panel (b) to (c) and, subsequently, to (d) demonstrates. Equation (38)\nholds true but the energy difference for the different extrapolation lengths gets smaller:\n\u22022\n\u22022\nE(\u039b, \u03b2, k1) <\nE(\u039b, \u03b2, k2) , k1 > k2 .\n(39)\n\u2202\u03b2\u2202\u039b\n\u2202\u03b2\u2202\u039b\nAs a result, the interval of change of the coefficient \u03b2 where the solution of the cubic GL\nequation can be replaced by its linear counterpart without noticeable loss of precision,\nshrinks and becomes less dependent on the de Gennes distance with growing density\nof the superconducting carriers ns . In fact, this conclusion is not unexpected since, as\nit was already stated above, the density ns is proportional to the square of the order\nparameter, equation (2), that, in turn, is defined by the factor k. At the same time, the\nsame expression \u03c72 (x) enters the effective potential Vef f (x), equation (14), what means\n\n\f13\n\nInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n1.4\n\na\n\n=0\n\n( )\n\nb\n\n( )\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\nk\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n=1\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n2.0\n\n0.2\n\n2.0\n\n0.2\n\n1.6\n\n1.6\n\n1.2\n\n0.0\n0.4\n\nk\n\nE\n\n0.8\n\n1.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.8\n\n2\n\n2.0\n\n0.4\n\n3\n\n0.0\n\n4\n5\n\nc\n\n( )\n\n1.4\n\nk\n\n1.2\n\nk\n\n1.4\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0.0\n\nd\n\n( )\n\n2\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n2.0\n\n0.2\n\n2.0\n\n0.2\n\n1.6\n\n1.6\n1.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.8\n\n1\n2\n\n0.4\n\n3\n4\n5\n\n0.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.8\n\n1\n2\n\n0.4\n\n3\n4\n5\n\n0.0\n\nFigure 3. a) Lowest energy E as a function of cubicity \u03b2 and coefficient k for the\nDirichlet case (upper surface) and for \u039b = 1 (lower surface).

Negative de Gennes lengths\nBefore discussing the interaction of the negative de Gennes distance and cubicity, one\nneeds to recall the linear limit, \u03b2 = 0, of the same geometry [17, 24\u201326, 34]. In this case,\nthe ground-state energy for \u039b < 0 always lies below zero. The adjacent upper state\npossesses negative energy too but only if the condition\n\u039b+ + \u039b\u2212 + 1 < 0\n\n(41)\n\nis satisfied [26]. Absolute values of the negative energies increase with dwindling |\u039b\u00b1 |,\nand at the vanishing and, in general, different lengths \u039b\u00b1 they diverge as [11]:\n1\n(42)\nE\u00b1 = \u2212 2 2 , \u039b+ \u2192 \u22120, \u039b\u2212 \u2192 \u22120.\n\u03c0 \u039b\u00b1\nFor the equal, equation (21), small negative de Gennes distances one has two almost\ndegenerate states with their symmetric and antisymmetric order parameters localized\nmainly at the interfaces. For the smaller |\u039b| the attraction of the interfaces gets\nstronger [26, 34], and at \u039b \u2192 \u22120 each of these two order parameters transforms into the\ncorresponding superposition of the \u03b4-functions with their origins at the interfaces [34]:\n\u03c7 ev (x) \u223c \u03b4(x \u2212 1/2) \u00b1 \u03b4(x + 1/2),\nodd\n\n\u039b \u2192 \u22120.\n\n(43)\n\nThus, the negative extrapolation length transforms the interface into the attractive\ncenter what results in lowering the Cooper pair energy and its localization at the\nedge. The smaller the magnitude of the negative de Gennes distance is, the larger the\nattraction and the stronger the localization of the surface state are. Unlimited growth\nof the magnitude of the negative energy from (42) is extremely interesting from the\npractical point of view since it means, according to (15), an unrestricted growth of the\ntemperature T . In the model of equations (9) and (10), the limit of the infinitely small\nnegative \u039btot can be achieved, for example, by applying to the zero-field Neumann edge\nan appropriately directed weak electric field E. We also mention that (42) is a particular\ncase of a more general property of the vanishingly small negative extrapolation length\nin any number of dimensions intensively studied recently by mathematicians [35\u201339].\nAs a first step in the analysis of the combined influence of the negative de Gennes\ndistance \u039b and cubicity \u03b2 on the temperature T , let us note that, as it directly follows\nfrom the transformation properties of the elliptic functions with complex argument\nand/or parameter [27, 28]\u00a7, equations (22) and (27) remain valid for the negative energies\nE too. Alternatively, one can directly use (19) where for E < 0 it is necessary to put\nE = \u2212|E|.

Rising factor \u03b7\u2212 leads to the corresponding increase of the energy and in\nthis way withstands the temperature growth produced by the negative \u039b.

However, even though the de Gennes\ndistance does not enter (50) explicitly, the temperature dependence on \u039b is crucial here.\nTo prove this, we state that \u03b7\u2212 = 1 is one of the points on the semi infinite strip of the\nunit width {0 \u2264 \u03b7\u2212 \u2264 1, \u2212\u221e < \u039b < 0} in the neighbourhood of which the energy E as\na function of the index \u03b7\u2212 and the length \u039b is represented in the separable form:\n\u0001\n1 2\n\u2212 1 \u03b3 (\u039b) , \u03b7\u2212 \u2192 1,\n(51)\nE(\u03b7\u2212 , \u039b) = 2 \u03b7\u2212\n\u03c0\nwhere, according to (47), the value of \u03b3 is determined from equation\nf (\u03b3, \u039b) = 0\n\n(52)\n\nwith\nf (y, \u039b) = 2y\n\n1/2\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1 1/2 1/2\n1\n1 1/2 1/2\n1 1/2 1/2\nsn\n+ dn\n.\ncn\ny ,2\ny ,2\ny ,2\n2\n2\n\u039b\n2\n\nThen, from (44) and (51), the order parameter \u03c70 (x) for T = Tc is written as\nr\n\u0001\n2 1/2\n\u03b3 nd \u03b3 1/2 x, 21/2 .\n\u03c70 (x) =\n\u03b2\n\n(53)\n\n(54)\n\nAny other values of \u03b3(\u039b) from (51) that do not satisfy (52) are unphysical ones. To\nexemplify this, in figure 5 we plot the order parameter, equation (54), for several values\nof \u03b3 with the solid line representing the case when (52) is satisfied. Similar to the linear\nregime discussed above, \u03b7\u2212 = 0, the probability of finding the Cooper pairs at the edges\nis larger than in the middle of the film. For the nonzero cubicity, \u03b7\u2212 > 0, the effective\npotential from (14) pushes the energy upwards and only for the value of \u03b3 satisfying\n(52) it exactly compensates the attractive influence of the interfaces with the negative\n\u039b. The potential Vef f (x) for any other \u03b3 is either too shallow to promote the energy to\nzero (see the dotted line in figure 5) or too strong (dashed line) with the corresponding\ntemperature T lying already below its bulk critical counterpart Tc what in either case\nmeans that the temperature T (\u03b7\u2212 , \u039b) in the vicinity of \u03b7\u2212 = 1 is not a continuous\nfunction what, obviously, eliminates these two unphysical \u03b3 from the consideration.\nSimilar to the case of the positive extrapolation lengths, the coefficients \u03b2 and k\nare compacted into the single factor \u03b7\u2212 , according to (45). In terms of \u03b2 and k there are\nthree distinct situations: k < 1, k = 1 and k > 1.

Its limit for the small nonlinearities reads:\n2\n(57)\n\u039b0 (\u03b2) = \u2212 , \u03b2 \u226a 1.\n\u03b2\nThis result is understandable since in the linear regime the energy for the large negative\nde Gennes distances lies only slightly below zero [26, 34] and, accordingly, small effective\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n18\n\npotential (14) is sufficient to turn it to zero and subsequently to push into the positive\nterritory. The magnitude of the negative \u039b0 grows together with the cubicity until it\nreaches zero at\n\u0001 \u03934 (1/4)\n2 \u22121/2\n= 13.7504,\n(58)\n\u03b20 = 4K 2\n=\n4\u03c0\nwhere \u0393(x) is \u0393-function [27, 29]. Vanishing \u039b0 (\u03b20 ) means that all critical lengths\nwith \u03b2 > \u03b20 , even though mathematically correct, are unphysical ones. In other\nwords, the effective potential (14) with \u03b2 = \u03b20 (and, of course, k = 1) completely\ncompensates an infinitely large temperature increase produced by the infinitely small\nnegative extrapolation length. Any superconducting state with \u03b2 > \u03b20 and k = 1 has\nits temperature always smaller than the critical temperature of the bulk material,\nT |\u03b2>\u03b20 < Tc ,\n\n(59)\n\nregardless of the surface contribution. From this point of view, the cubicity \u03b2 of the\nGL equation as compared to the de Gennes boundary is a stronger factor affecting\nthe properties of the superconducting film; however, as it will be shown in the next\nparagraph, a substantial role in this drastic energy increase is played by the de Gennes\ndistance itself. Critical extrapolation length \u039b0 is shown in panel (a) of figure 6 where\nthe states above (below) the curve correspond to the temperature higher (lower) than\nTc .\nIt might look surprising that the finite cubicity is able to bring into the area T < Tc\nthe state with any vanishingly small negative \u039b when, at \u03b2 = 0, its energy tends to\nthe negative infinity, according to (42). For example, a comparison with the other\nconfigurations shows that the critical extrapolation length \u039b0 (B), which is calculated\nfrom the linear GL equation for the quantum dot or antidot in the uniform magnetic field\nB, asymptotically tends to zero from below only for the intensities B approaching infinity\n[11]. To resolve this seeming paradox, one needs to analyse the form of the effective\npotential (14) for the small negative de Gennes distance that, in the linear case, \u03b2 = 0,\nattracts the order parameter to the edges and, in this way, delivers the larger ability for\nthe potential to repulse the Cooper pairs from the walls. Thus, the extrapolation length\ntending to zero from the left produces at nonzero cubicity two contradicting to each\nother effects: on the one hand, it pushes the energy downwards by localizing the order\nparameter at the interfaces and, on the other hand, as a consequence of the previous\naction, it simultaneously provides the effective potential Vef f (x), equation (14), with\nthe larger ability to repel the function \u03c7(x) from the film edges with the corresponding\nincrease of the energy. The smaller the magnitude of the negative de Gennes distance\nis, the larger the negative energy becomes and the stronger localization at the surfaces\nis but, at the same time, just due to this stronger localization, the faster the effective\npotential Vef f (x) grows with the small increasing \u03b2. In other words, potential (14) in\nits effort to push the energy upwards and the order parameter away from the edges\nis actually aided by the small negative length \u039b that facilitates this energy growth\nby pulling the order parameter to the interfaces with the corresponding increase of its\n\n\f19\n\nInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\na\n\n-8\n\n( )\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n6\n\nb\n\n( )\n\n5\n\n4\n\n0\n\n( )\n\nx\n\n3\n\n2\n\n12\n\n1\n0.50\n\n10\n8\n\n0.25\n\n6\n\n0.00\n\n4\n-0.25\n\n2\n0\n\nx\n\n-0.50\n\nFigure 6.

This fine interaction between the cubicity and de Gennes distance\nresults ultimately in the drawing out of the energy from any arbitrary large negative\nvalues.\nConcerning equation (56) and figure 6(a), it is necessary to elaborate the following\nremark already mentioned in passing while discussing (58). Since the Jacobi elliptic\nfunctions - in particular, sn(u, k), cn(u, k) and dn(u, k), which enter (56), - are doubly\nperiodic functions of its argument u, for each \u039b0 from figure 6(a) there exists a countably\ninfinite set of its counterparts with the same value achieved at the larger cubicities \u03b2.\nHowever, physically all these critical extrapolation lengths for \u03b2 > \u03b20 are spurious ones.\nThis can be seen, for example, from the fact that their corresponding order parameters\nexhibit infinite discontinuities at some points inside the film, \u22121/2 \u2264 x \u2264 1/2. To save\nspace, we do not plot these unphysical functions here presenting instead in panel (b) of\nfigure 6 an evolution of the zero-energy order parameter\n!\nr\n\u03b2\n(60)\nx, 21/2\n\u03c70 (x) = nd\n2\nwith the growing cubicity. It exhibits a smooth transformation from the flat Neumann\nshape at \u03b2 = 0, when, according to (56) and (57), the critical extrapolation length is\nequal to the negative infinity, to the linear superposition of the two \u03b4-functions, equation\n(43), at \u03b2 = \u03b20 when the critical de Gennes distance tends to zero from the left. For any\ncubicity larger than the critical one, \u03b2 > \u03b20 , these infinities migrate from the edges into\nthe middle of the film turning in this way the corresponding solutions into the spurious\nones.\nNext, consider the cases of k 6= 1. When the integration factor k is less than unity,\nk < 1, the corresponding solution always exists with its energy lying below zero for all\ncubicities. For the large nonlinear term, \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, it ceases to depend on the cubicity\napproaching asymptotically a solution of the equation\n!\n!\nr\nr\nr\n2 |E| \u221a\n2 |E| \u221a\n\u0001\n\u03c0 2 |E|\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n1\n1\n, 1 + k 2 cn\n, 1 + k2\n1 + k 2 sn\n1 \u2212 k2\n2 1 \u2212 k2\n2 1 \u2212 k2\n!\nr\n1 \u03c0 2 |E| \u221a\n1\n, 1 + k 2 = 0, 0 < k < 1, \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e,\n+ dn\n(61)\n\u039b\n2 1 \u2212 k2\nthat is derived from (45) - (47). For the smaller densities the saturation energy\n(temperature T ) is smaller (larger).

On the other hand, for k > 1 the energy can not grow more than the threshold\nvalue ET H defined by the cubicity and density:\n1\n(64)\nE < ET H \u2261 \u2212 2 \u03b2(k 2 \u2212 1), k > 1,\n2\u03c0\nas it directly follows from (45) and (46). In fact, the state ceases to exist at the energies\nsmaller than ET H since (47) in this case contains the Jacobi functions of the form\n\u0012r\n\u0013\n1\nsn\n, \u03b7\u2212\nE \u2212 ET H\nthat, similar to their trigonometric counterparts [40], possess infnitely many oscillations\nfor E \u2192 ET H . Upon its growth with the cubicity, the eigenvalue of (47) approaches one\nof the zeros of these oscillations and merges with it after which the two corresponding\nreal energies transform into the two complex conjugate values. Since the present research\ndeals with the real energies and order parameters only, this merger is considered\nas a disappearance of the corresponding state. Physically, a destruction of the\nsuperconductivity for these parameters is explained by the fact that the decreasing\ntemperature T can not support the fixed large density ns of the superconducting carriers\nwith its concentration near the film interfaces.\nTo exemplify the results obtained above, figure 7 depicts energy as a function of the\ncubicity for several miscellaneous combinations of the negative extrapolation lengths and\ndensities. It is seen that for k < 1 (dashed line) the energy saturates with the increasing\n\u03b2 to its asymptotic value calculated from (61) while for k > 1 (dash-dotted curve) the\nstate ceases to exist on its energy approach to ET H . A comparison of the curves with\nk = 1 and different magnitudes of the negative de Gennes distances (solid, dotted and\ntwo dash-dot-dotted lines) vividly manifests a convergence of the zero-energy cubicity\nto its critical value \u03b20 from (58); namely, for the large enough negative \u039b only the small\ncubicity is needed to bring the energy to zero (dotted line in figure 7) while for the very\nsmall magnitudes of the de Gennes distance, for example, depicted by the two dashdot-dotted lines, the energies of the corresponding states that differ by four orders of\nmagnitudes in the liear regime, \u03b2 = 0, cross zero at about the same \u03b2 being very close\nto \u03b20 . After passing zero, the energy continues to rise with its order parameter given by\ns\n!\nr\n\u03b2\n2\u03c0 2 E \u2212 \u03b2\n.\n(65)\nx,\n\u03c7(x)|k=1 = dc\n2\n\u03b2\nAs it follows from (34a), for the very large nonlinearities, it diverges to the infinity with\n\u03b2/\u03c0 2 being its principal term, and the order parameter tends to unity, equation (34b).\nThus, since the concentration with k = 1 for the large cubicities corresponds to the\nboundary-free situation, the state with only this density is allowed, for the negative de\nGennes distances, to cross the bulk critical temperature with the increasing \u03b2. Evolution\nwith the cubicity of the order parameter \u03c7(x) corresponding to the solid line of figure 7\nis shown in figure 8.

It is easy to understand the origin of this wrong conclusion;\nnamely, when the energy is bluntly put to zero in (19), resulting equation (66) and\nits solution (67) know nothing about the quasi-peculiarity in (46) and its elimination\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n24\n\nby the ansatz from (51). Equations (44) - (47), (55), (56) and (60) for the negative\nE contain much more information about the temperature behaviour close to Tc than\ntheir zero-energy counterparts (67) - (69). Due to their limited knowledge, the latter\nequations erroneously advice us that the zero energy can be achieved at any magnitudes\nof \u03b2 and k if the product k 2 \u03b2 obeys (68) while in the reality the film temperature is\nequal to the bulk critical temperature Tc for the unity factor k only with the cubicity \u03b2\nsatisfying (55).\n4. Concluding remarks\nExact solutions of the GL equation for the superconducting film with its edges\nsubjected to the Robin-type boundary condition (12) revealed strong dependence of\nthe temperature T on the interaction between the de Gennes distance and cubicity\nwith, in addition, very substantial influence of the superconducting carriers density ns .\nDepending on these parameters, a rich spectrum of the temperature T is obtained and\nanalysed in detail. For example, the interplay of the negative extrapolation length and\nnonlinearity causes the decreasing with the growing cubicity temperature T to cross\nits bulk critical value at the unique carrier concentration only while for the smaller\ndensities its stays above Tc for all cubicites, and the superconductivity is destroyed by\nthe increasing coefficient \u03b2 for the larger Cooper pairs concentration. The uniqueness\nof this density stems from the fact that only for it the increasing cubicity transforms\nthe solution of the GL equation for the film into the one corresponding to the bulk\nsuperconductor.\nThere are several possible ways of varying the de Gennes distance and magnitude of\nthe nonlinear GL term. Experiment suggests that the value of the extrapolation length\ncan be controlled by the sample preparation procedure [15]. Even more promising\nfrom this point of view is its manipulation by the applied gate voltage, according to\n(9) and (10). Miscellaneous aspects of the influence of the electrostatic fields on the\nsuperconducting films have been the subject of the experimental investigations for more\nthan fifty years [41\u201347]; in particular, the change of the critical temperature under\nnonzero E has been observed [41, 45, 47]. However, despite its long history of research,\nelectric field effects on superconductors are still far from being understood [48\u201353].\nWith regards to the cubicity \u03b2, the methods of its variation follow straightforwardly\nfrom definition (4) for the pure metals [7, 8] and, especially, its alloy modification [6, 7, 9];\nnamely, different impurity doping drastically changes the mean free path l that becomes\nmuch smaller than the coherence length \u03be(0) thus leading to the substantial increase\nof the nonlinear influence. In addition, the range of validity of the GL theory is much\nwider for the 'dirty' superconductors [7]. Accordingly, it is believed that applying the\ngate voltage to the films composed with the different concentration of impurities, one\ncan experimentally observe the predicted phenomena.\n\n\fInterplay between boundary conditions and cubicity of Ginzburg-Landau equation\n\n25\n\nReferences\n[1] Ginzburg V L and Landau L D 1950 Zh.
