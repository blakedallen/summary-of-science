(2007) argue that educational research is in crisis. In their opinion,\nthe transdisciplinary and interdiscursive approach of complexity science with its\norientation towards self-organization, emergence, and potentiality provides new modes of\ninquiry, a new lexicon and assessment practices that can be used to overcome the current\ncrisis. In this contribution, I elaborate on how complexity science can further be\ndeveloped for understanding the dynamics of intentions and the communication of\nmeaning as these are central to the social-scientific enterprise.\nUnder the denominator of \"complexity science\" a number of physicists, biologists, and\nmathematicians have proposed \"self-organization\" as a metaphor. \"Self-organization,\"\nhowever, has a meaning in the context of Prigogine's (1980) thermodynamics of farfrom-equilibrium systems that differs from its use in Maturana & Varela's (1984)\nneurophysiology-based model of autopoiesis. Luhmann (1986) proposed using the latter\nmodel to analyse the communication of meaning in social and psychological systems.\nThe distinction between social and psychological systems was based on Husserl's (1929)\nphilosophy, but radicalized by Luhmann to the extent that these two types of systems are\nconsidered as operationally closed and therefore as constituting environments for each\nother. In other words, social systems can be expected to process meaning differently from\npsychological systems.\nThe cybernetic model of self-organization may have its origins in biology or physics, but\nthe crucial question is whether the metaphor helps to explain problems and puzzles in the\nsystem(s) under study (Holland, 1998). Unlike biology, the social sciences study\nintentional subjects and their social configurations. The non-linear dynamics of meaning\nare hitherto poorly understood as a subject of complexity science. Meaning is provided\nfrom the perspective of hindsight, and thus the arrow of time is locally reversed (Coveney\n& Highfield, 1990; Leydesdorff, 1994; Urry, 2003; Mackenzie, 2001). This may reduce\nthe uncertainty that would otherwise be expected to increase because the Second Law is\nvalid both for thermodynamics and for the dynamics of probabilistic entropy (Theil,\n1972).\nThe mechanism of providing meaning can be modeled using the theory of anticipatory\nsystems (Rosen, 1985). An anticipatory system is a system that is able to entertain one or\nmore models of itself. The model provides the modeled system with specific meaning.\nDubois (1998) found a way to formalize this as an incursive equation. Using these\nequations, a distinction can be made between weakly and strongly anticipatory systems.\n\n1\n\n\fThe latter are able not only to model themselves, but also to co-construct their next future\nstates.\nIn this context, I proposed using this distinction to model the difference between\npsychological and social systems: while psychological systems are able to entertain\nmodels of themselves, social systems are able to co-construct their own next states, for\nexample, in the case of techno-economic co-evolutions (Leydesdorff, 2008). Using\nDubois's equations, it is possible to derive formulations for the three levels at which\nmeaning can be communicated according to Luhmann (1997): interaction, organization,\nand self-organization. However, it follows from these equations that the system would\naccumulate complexity if agency did not step in to make selective choices. The social\nsystem can therefore be considered as semi-autopoietic: the further development of the\nsystem remains dependent on agency to co-evolve, for example, in terms of\ncommunicative competencies (Habermas, 1981).\nWithin Luhmann's theory, this additional coupling between agents and structures can be\nappreciated as \"interpenetration\" (Parsons, 1968; Luhmann, 2002). Unlike the biological\nmechanism of structural coupling and operational closure, social and psychological\nsystems have access to each other's operations. This additional degree of freedom can be\nconsidered as grounded in the emergence of human language as an evolutionary step\n(Leydesdorff, 2000). The controversy signaled by Habermas (1987, at p. 385) between\n\"linguistically generated intersubjectivity\" and \"self-referentially closed systems\" can\nthus be considered as a puzzle which complex systems theory may be able to solve.\nreturn\nReferences:\nCoveney, P., & Highfield, R.
