When a fundamental beam propagates along a threefold\nrotational axis, this coherent second-order optical process is permitted by angular momentum\nconservation through the rotational analogue of the Umklapp process. As a demonstration, we\nexperimentally obtained polarization properties of collinear magnetic DFG along a [111] axis of a\nsingle crystal of antiferromagnetic NiO with micro multidomain structure, which excellently agreed\nwith the theoretical prediction.\nPACS numbers: 78.20.Ls, 42.65.-k, 76.50.+g\n\n1\n\n\fRecent developments in pulsed laser techniques have enabled ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetization in solids [1\u201310]. In particular, coherent control through Ramaninduced nonlinear optical processes [1\u20134] has attracted interests, because low- energy magnetic excitations are accessible without excess heating [5]. Therefore, compared with the\nconventional processes involving optical absorption followed by thermal relaxation [6\u20139],\nthese coherent processes have potential applications including quantum information processing and ultrafast switching techniques for spintronics.\nIn such coherent optical processes, conservation of angular momentum determines the\npolarization of the induced excitation, whereas conservation of energy and momentum determines its frequency and wave vector, respectively [11, 12]. The balance of angular momentum includes contributions from the electromagnetic field (JEM ), excitations in solids\n(Jex ), and the crystalline lattice (Jc ): \u2206JEM + \u2206Jex + \u2206Jc = 0 [12]. When the z-axis is a\ncontinuous rotational axis, JzEM +Jzex must be rigorously conserved because Jzc is a conserved\nquantity under any rotation around the z-axis. By contrast, along a threefold rotational axis\nof the crystal, JzEM + Jzex is conserved within a change of 3~; this is the rotational analogue\nof the Umklapp process [12, 13]. This discrete rotational symmetry in solids, and the resultant polarization selection rules in nonlinear optics, has been taken into account for decades\nwhen the second-harmonic generation [12, 13] and the parametric down-conversion [14] are\ndiscussed. However, little attention has been paid to implications of the discrete rotational\nsymmetry for the coherent control of elementary excitations in solids.\nIn this Letter, we discuss selection rules for optically induced magnetization from a viewpoint of conservation of angular momentum. The inverse Faraday effect [15] and the magnetic difference-frequency generation (DFG) are used as specific examples. Both are described by third-rank axial c-tensors \u03c7(2)MEE that change sign under time reversal [16, 17].\nThe superscripts label magnetic (M) or electronic (E) interactions. Subsequently, we propose collinear magnetic DFG along a threefold rotational axis as a scheme of optical control\nof magnetization, using the discrete rotational symmetry. As a demonstration, polarization\nselection rules are calculated and experimentally obtained for a collinear DFG in NiO that\ninvolves two frequency components of an ultrashort laser pulse, showing excellent agreement.\nTo discuss the conservation of angular momentum in light-matter interactions for photons\npropagating along the z-axis, it is convenient to distinguish vector fields by their helicity.\nAny electric field E with a propagating vector k along the z-axis can be decomposed into\n2\n\n\f\u0002\n\u0003\ncircular bases as: E(\u03c9, z) = 2Re (E+ e+ + E\u2212 e\u2212 + Ez ez ) e\u2212i(\u03c9t\u2212kz) , with unit vectors, e+ =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(ex +iey )/ 2, e\u2212 = (ex \u2212iey )/ 2, and ez . E+ and E\u2212 are left- and right- circular light fields,\nwhereas Ez is longitudinal. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), creation or annihilation of a photon\ninduces \u2206JzEM = \u00b1~ in correspondence with its helicity, while JzEM = 0 for the longitudinal\nfield along the z-axis. The same rule is available for a magnetic field represented in circular\nbases. Therefore, if and only if the angular momentum of an elementary excitation is \u00b1~,\nits transition to and from one photon that propagates along the z-axis is allowed.\nA light beam at the frequency \u03c9 can induce dc magnetization M(0) through the inverse\nFaraday effect:\n(2)\n\n(2)MEE\n\nMi (0) = \u03c7ijk\n\n(0; \u2212\u03c9, \u03c9)Ej\u2217(\u03c9)Ek (\u03c9),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E(\u03c9) is the electric field of the light wave [15]. In a nonabsorbing isotropic medium\n(2)\n\ninvariant under time-reversal, \u03c7ijk = \u03c7\u03b5ijk . Here, \u03c7 is a scalar and \u03b5ijk is the Levi-Civita\ntensor. Then, Eq. (1) is reduced to M(2) = \u03c7E\u2217 \u00d7 E = \u03c7(|E+ |2 \u2212 |E\u2212 |2 )ez . Thus, in an\n\nisotropic medium, an elliptically polarized light beam induces M(2) along its propagating\n\ndirection.\nSimilarly, ac magnetization M(2) (\u03a9) at the difference frequency \u03a9 = \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 can be\nparametrically generated by two light waves with frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92 through a stimulated\nRaman-type nonlinear process [18, 19]:\n(2)\n\n(2)MEE\n\nMi (\u03a9) = \u03c7ijk\n\n(\u03a9; \u2212\u03c91 , \u03c92 )Ej\u2217 (\u03c91 )Ek (\u03c92 ).\n\n(2)\n\nWhen M(2) (\u03a9) is not only Raman (two-photon) active but also infrared (one-photon) active\n(via a magnetic dipole process), magnetic field H(2) (\u03a9) and electric field E(2) (\u03a9) are radiated\nfrom M(2) (\u03a9) [18]:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03a92\n\u03a92\n\u2207 \u00d7 (\u2207\u00d7) \u2212 2 \u03b5r H(2) (\u03a9) = 2 \u03b5r M(2) (\u03a9)\nc\nc\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212i\u03a9\u03b5r \u03b50 E(2) (\u03a9) = \u2207 \u00d7 H(2) (\u03a9),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b5r is the relative permittivity at \u03a9, \u03b50 is the vacuum permittivity, and c is the speed\nof light; this is the magnetic DFG.\nIn continuous rotational symmetry, as in a liquid or gas, the requirement of rigorous\nconservation of JzEM + Jzex forbids collinear DFG - i.e., DFG with incident and out-going\nphotons propagating along the same (z-) direction. In particular, optically induced magnetic\n3\n\n\fexcitation in the medium has Jzex of either 0 or \u00b12~, and is thus nonradiative [Figs. 1(b)\n\nand (c)]. Note that generation of longitudinal field (Jzex = 0), rather than DFG, is possible\n\nby scattering the incident photon to a mode with the same helicity. If the scattered mode\nis the identical one with the same frequency, the result is a dc field along the z-axis, which\ncontributes to the inverse Faraday effect.\nHowever, DFG is not necessarily forbidden if a fundamental light beam propagates along a\ncrystal's threefold symmetry axis and involves two photons of opposite helicity - a linearly\npolarized pulse satisfies this condition, while purely circularly polarized pulse does not.\nThis is because this discrete symmetry allows the change of Jzc by 3~ [12, 14]. For example,\nannihilation of the right-circular photon and creation of the left-circular photon induces a\nmagnetic excitation with Jzex = \u22122~. This is equivalent to +~ through decrease of Jzc by\n\n3~, and emits a left-circular photon [Fig. 1(d)]. The result is that JzEM increases by 3~ and\nthe total angular momentum is conserved. For an incident pulse that is linearly polarized,\na mirror process occurs simultaneously, where \u2206JzEM = \u22123~ and \u2206Jzc = +3~.\n\nNonvanishing transverse components of \u03c7(2)MEE invariant under rotation by 2\u03c0/3 around\n\nz-axis describes the allowed collinear DFG process along a threefold axis:\n\u03c7xxx = \u2212\u03c7xyy = \u2212\u03c7yxy = \u2212\u03c7yyx \u2261 \u03b1,\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c7yyy = \u2212\u03c7yxx = \u2212\u03c7xyx = \u2212\u03c7xxy \u2261 \u03b2,\n\n(6)\n\nand other components vanish. Here, \u03b1 and \u03b2 may also be zero depending on additional\nspatial or temporal symmetry operations allowed. In the circular basis, they are\n\u03c7+++ \u2261 \u03c7ijk (e+ )\u2217i (e+ )\u2217j (e+ )\u2217k =\n\u03c7\u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2261 \u03c7ijk (e\u2212 )\u2217i (e\u2212 )\u2217j (e\u2212 )\u2217k =\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\n2(\u03b1 + i\u03b2)\n\n(7)\n\n2(\u03b1 \u2212 i\u03b2),\n\n(8)\n\nwhich correspond to the processes that involve change of JzEM by 3~ and \u22123~, respectively.\nWhen the amplitudes of these two processes are the same, as in the case of NiO discussed\nbelow, the resultant radiation is linearly polarized for an incident pulse with any fixed\npolarization.\nIn the remaining paragraphs, the above description of the collinear DFG will be applied to\nthe interpretation of our experimental observation of THz radiation from antiferromagnetic\nmagnons in NiO illuminated by laser pulses. We chose the direction of the propagation of\nlight to be parallel to the [111] axis of an as-grown crystal of NiO that consists of randomly\n4\n\n\fdistributed domains due to magnetic ordering. This axis is effectively threefold if the signal\ninduced in each domain is coherently superposed, as we will discuss below. NiO has a\nmagnon resonance around 1 THz that is both Raman [20] and infrared [21, 22] active.\nRecently, researchers reported radiation from the magnon [3] and oscillation of the Faraday\nrotation [4] after illumination by pulsed lasers. Our setup differs from these previous studies\nin the selection of the crystal orientation and the domain structure because it is crucial\nfor a clear demonstration of this DFG process. Note also that the absence of spontaneous\nmagnetization in NiO rules out photomagnetic effect [10].\nNiO crystallizes in a rocksalt structure above its N\u00e9el temperature of TN = 523 K. Below\nTN , the Ni2+ ions with opposite sign of spins (S = 1) occupy equivalent crystallographic\npositions [Fig. 2(a)], forming two sublattices. Subsequent lattice distortion induces four\nvariants called T -domains, and each of them have three variants called S-domains that\ndiffer by their spin orientation (total of 12 variants) [23]. For one of the T -domains, T1 , the\ncrystal shows slight rhombohedral distortion along its [111] axis; for T2 to T4 , the distortion\nis along the other three diagonals. The domains are accommodated by twin structures\nrandomly distributed in an as-grown NiO crystal [Fig. 2(b)] [24], and their sizes were several\nmicrometers according to polarization microscopy. The spin orientation in one of the three\nS-domains belonging to T1 -domains (denoted by T1 (S1 )) is [112\u0304] and for T1 (S2 ) and T1 (S3 ),\ntheir equivalents in the (111) plane [Fig. 2(a)].\nTo examine whether all domains coherently contribute to the magnetic response, we\nmeasured the magnetic susceptibility tensor of an as-grown NiO crystal near its magnon\nresonance (\u223c 1 THz) by time-domain spectroscopy at room temperature [Fig. 2(c)]. Ellipsometric measurements showed that the magnetic response is isotropic [25]. This indicates\nthat although the susceptibility of each S-domain is anisotropic [26, 27], coherent superposition of the 12 variants results in effectively isotropic susceptibility, described by a scalar\n\u03c7\u03bc (\u03c9).\nThe magnetic susceptibility of this magnon resonance is calculated as:\n2\u03b3 2 M H\n\n2\nA\n,\n3 \u03b3 2 HA (2AM +HA )\u2212\u03c9 2 +2i\u0393\u03c9\n\n\u03c7\u03bc (\u03c9) =\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of an electron, \u0393 is the damp-\n\ning coefficient, M is the sublattice magnetization, and AM and HA are the exchange and\nanisotropy fields, respectively [26, 27]. The factor of 2/3 is the result of averaging over the\ndomains. Figure 2(d) is the plot of \u03c7\u03bc (\u03c9) using M, A, and HA from the literature [28] and\ntaking thermal suppression of M into account [21, 22]. The quantitative agreement with\n5\n\n\fthe experimental result assured us that the S-domains are sufficiently large to accommodate\nmagnons.\nThe DFG in this sample, therefore, is also described by coherent superposition of the\nsignal generated in each of the 12 variants:\n(2)\n\nMi\n\n(2)MEE\n\n= \u03c7ijk\n\nEj\u2217 Ek \u2261\n\nX 1 (2)MEE,n\n\u03c7ijk\nEj\u2217 Ek .\n12\nn\n\n(9)\n\nHere, \u03c7(2)MEE,n is the nonlinear susceptibility tensor of an n-th domain, which can be characterized by its orientation with respect to the crystal's Cartesian frame, denoted by superscript (C), as depicted in Fig. 3(a). In a single T1 (S1 )-domain, the allowed symmetry\noperations are 1, 1, 2y , and 2y , and magnetic point group of a Ni site is 2/m (the underbars\ndenote time-reversal operation) [17]. This gives 14 nonvanishing independent components\nof \u03c7(2)MEE,n , including \u03c7zzz , \u03c7xxx , \u03c7yyx , \u03c7zzx , \u03c7xxz , \u03c7yyz , and other components obtained by\npermutation of the Cartesian indices. Tensors for other variants are obtained, as is discussed\nfor magnetic second-harmonic generation [24]: the tensor of a T1 (S2 )-domain is calculated\nby transforming \u03c7(2)MEE,S1 under rotation by 2\u03c0/3 around the z (C) -axis. The nonvanishing\ntransverse components of \u03c7(2)MEE in the crystal coordinate frame is derived by averaging\n\u03c7(2)MEE,n over the 12 variants as:\n\u03c7xxx = \u2212\u03c7xyy = \u2212\u03c7yxy = \u2212\u03c7yyx = \u03b1.\n\n(10)\n\nThese are precisely the transverse components of a tensor that is invariant under rotation\nby 2\u03c0/3: a special case of Eqs. (5) and (6) in which \u03b2 = 0. Therefore, this multidomain\ncrystal behaves in the same way as a single-domain crystal with threefold symmetry as far\nas the DFG is concerned, and thus collinear DFG along the z (C) -axis is allowed.\nWe performed time-domain spectroscopy measurements of THz radiation from NiO. The\ncrystal was irradiated by Ti-sapphire-based ultrashort laser pulses (\u223c 100 fs) along its [111]\ncrystallographic axis, as shown in Fig. 3(a). With linearly polarized excitation, the DFG was\nobserved, but not with circular polarization. Figures 3(b) and (c) show a typical temporal\nwaveform of the generated THz field E(2) (t), and its Fourier transformed spectrum |E(2) (\u03a9)|,\nrespectively. Radiation with a resonant frequency of \u03a90 \u223c 1 THz was observed. Note that\nthe absorption coefficient of NiO is small (60 cm\u22121 ) for the laser wavelength (\u223c 800 nm)\n[29], and thus, the theory for nonabsorbing media is applicable.\nPolarization properties of the THz radiation were observed by THz ellipsometry. Incident\nlight Ep was fixed to be x(L) -polarized, and the sample was rotated by an angle \u03b8 around the\n6\n\n\fz (L) -axis: the superscript (L) denotes the laboratory coordinate, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The\nradiation was linearly polarized for any \u03b8, and the x(L) - and y (L) - polarized components of\nE(2) (t) were acquired using a wire-grid polarizer installed behind the sample [25]. Transverse\ncomponents of M(2) (\u03a90 ) at the resonant frequency \u03a90 were determined as functions of \u03b8,\nusing Eqs. (3) and (4), and are shown in Figs. 3(d, e).\n(2)\n\nIn the laboratory coordinate frame, Mx\n\n(2)\n\nand My\n\ncan be calculated by Eq. (2), in\n\nwhich the susceptibility tensor is derived by rotating the tensor in Eq. (10) by \u03b8 around the\nz (L) -axis:\nMx(2) = \u03b1|Ep |2 cos 3\u03b8, My(2) = \u03b1|Ep|2 sin 3\u03b8.\n\n(11)\n\n(L)\n\nHere, Ep k ex is used. Angular dependence of Eq. (11) is depicted in Figs. 3(d, e), showing\n\nexcellent agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the measured amplitude |M (2) |\nwas proportional to |Ep |2 , indicating that the radiation mechanism is indeed a second-order\n\nnonlinear optical process. It is important that the THz ellipsometry along a linearly isotropic\naxis allows us to obtain directly the orientation of the induced magnetization in contrast\nwith nonlinear optical techniques [30]; for example by the Faraday rotation [1, 2, 4, 8], the\nKerr rotation [5, 6], or second-harmonic generation [9].\nIn summary, we showed that magnetization can be induced through a collinear magnetic\nDFG process, which is allowed with linearly polarized excitation along a threefold axis.\nThe rotational analogue of the Umklapp process plays a key role because it allows the\nchange of JzEM + Jzex by \u00b13~. We experimentally demonstrated the DFG resonant on the\nantiferromagnetic magnons in a multidomain NiO crystal. We observed clear polarization\ndependence on the incident and radiated photons under linearly polarized excitation, in\nexcellent agreement with the theoretical description. It has highlighted that the conservation\nof angular momentum can provide a general guiding principle to design experiments by\ntaking material's symmetries into account. Note that this concept is readily applicable to\nother elementary excitations induced through the nonlinear optical processes, for example,\nelectronic DFG or optical rectification because both electric and magnetic fields behave\nin the same way under a rotation that maintains the parity (proper rotation). Extensive\napplications of this approach to other systems, such as artificial structures or atomic gasses\nin optical lattices, are expected.\nThe authors appreciate Yu. P.
