Introduction\nWith the establishment or construction of many radioactive beam facilities around\nthe world, such as the Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) facility at HIRFL in China 1 ,\nthe Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) Factory at RIKEN in Japan 2 , the FAIR/GSI in\nGermany 3 , SPIRAL2/GANIL in France 4 , and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams\n1\n\n\fNovember 3, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nKiso1117\n\nLie-Wen Chen et al.\n\n(FRIB) in USA 5 , it is possible in terrestrial laboratories to explore the equation of\nstate (EOS) of an isospin asymmetric nuclear matter under the extreme condition\nof large isospin asymmetry and thus to determine the density dependence of the\nnuclear symmetry energy. This knowledge is important for understanding not only\nthe structure of radioactive nuclei, the reaction dynamics induced by rare isotopes,\nand the liquid-gas phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter, but also many\ncritical issues in astrophysics 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 .\nFor symmetric nuclear matter with equal fractions of neutrons and protons,\nits EOS is relatively well-determined. In particular, the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter at its saturation density \u03c10 has been determined to be\n240 \u00b1 20 MeV from analyses of the nuclear giant monopole resonances (GMR)\n16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 , and its EOS at densities of 2\u03c1 < \u03c1 < 5\u03c1 has also been\n0\n0\nconstrained by measurements of collective flows 8 and subthreshold kaon production 25,26 in relativistic nucleus\u2013nucleus collisions. On the other hand, the EOS of\nasymmetric nuclear matter and the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry\nenergy, is largely unknown except at \u03c10 where the nuclear symmetry energy has\nbeen determined to be around 30 MeV from the empirical liquid-drop mass formula 27,28 . The values of the symmetry energy at other densities, particularly at\nsupra-saturation densities, are poorly known 6,7,15,29,30,31 .\nHeavy-ion collisions, especially those induced by neutron-rich nuclei, provide a\nunique tool to investigate the EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter, especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. During the last decade, significant\nprogress has been made both experimentally and theoretically on constraining the\nbehavior of the symmetry energy at subsaturation density using heavy-ion reactions\n32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39 (See Ref. 15 for the most recent review). More recently, there\nhas also been an attempt 40 to extract the symmetry energy at supersaturation\ndensities from the FOPI data on the \u03c0 \u2212 /\u03c0 + ratio in central heavy-ion collisions at\nSIS/GSI 41 . Information on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy\nhas also been obtained from the structure of finite nuclei and their excitations, such\nas the mass data 42 , neutron skin in heavy nuclei 43 , giant dipole resonances 44 ,\npygmy dipole resonance 45 , and so on. These studies have significantly improved\nour understanding of the EOS of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter.\nThe incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter at its saturation density\nis a basic quantity to characterize its EOS. In principle, this information can be\nextracted experimentally by measuring the GMR in neutron-rich nuclei 46,47 . In\nthe present talk, we report our recent work on the incompressibility of isospin\nasymmetric nuclear matter at saturation density 48,49 .\n2. Incompressibility of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter\nThe EOS of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter, given by its binding energy per\nnucleon, can be generally expressed as a power series in the isospin asymmetry\n\u03b4 = (\u03c1n \u2212\u03c1p )/\u03c1, where \u03c1 = \u03c1n +\u03c1p is the baryon density with \u03c1n and \u03c1p denoting the\n\n\fNovember 3, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nKiso1117\n\nIncompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter\n\n3\n\nneutron and proton densities, respectively. To the 4th-order in isospin asymmetry,\nit is written as\nE(\u03c1, \u03b4) = E0 (\u03c1) + Esym (\u03c1)\u03b4 2 + Esym,4 (\u03c1)\u03b4 4 + O(\u03b4 6 ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E0 (\u03c1) = E(\u03c1, \u03b4 = 0) is the binding energy per nucleon of symmetric nuclear\nmatter, and\nEsym (\u03c1) =\n\n1 \u2202 2 E(\u03c1, \u03b4)\n1 \u2202 4 E(\u03c1, \u03b4)\n|\u03b4=0 , Esym,4 (\u03c1) =\n|\u03b4=0 .\n2\n2! \u2202\u03b4\n4!\n\u2202\u03b4 4\n\n(2)\n\nIn the above, Esym (\u03c1) is the so-called nuclear symmetry energy and Esym,4 (\u03c1) is\nthe 4th-order nuclear symmetry energy.\nAround the normal density \u03c10 , the E0 (\u03c1) can be expanded, e.g., up to 4th-order\nin density, as\nK0 2 J0 3 I0 4\n\u03c7 + \u03c7 + \u03c7 + O(\u03c75 ),\n2!\n3!\n4!\nwhere \u03c7 is a dimensionless variable characterizing the deviations of the density\nfrom the saturation density \u03c10 of symmetric nuclear matter, and it is conventionally\n0\ndefined as \u03c7 = \u03c1\u2212\u03c1\n3\u03c10 . The E0 (\u03c10 ) is the binding energy per nucleon in symmetric\nnuclear matter at the saturation density \u03c10 and the coefficients of other terms are\ndefined by\nE0 (\u03c1) = E0 (\u03c10 ) + L0 \u03c7 +\n\ndE0 (\u03c1)\nd2 E0 (\u03c1)\n|\u03c1=\u03c10 ,\n|\u03c1=\u03c10 , K0 = 9\u03c120\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c12\n4\nd3 E0 (\u03c1)\n4 d E0 (\u03c1)\nJ0 = 27\u03c130\n,\nI\n=\n81\u03c1\n|\n|\u03c1=\u03c10 .\n0\n\u03c1=\u03c1\n0\n0\nd\u03c13\nd\u03c14\n\nL0 = 3\u03c10\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nObviously, we have L0 = 0 according to the definition of the saturation density \u03c10\nof symmetric nuclear matter. The coefficient K0 is the so-called incompressibility\ncoefficient of symmetric nuclear matter, and it characterizes the curvature of E0 (\u03c1)\nat \u03c10 . The coefficients J0 and I0 correspond, respectively, to 3rd-order and 4th-order\nincompressibility coefficients of symmetric nuclear matter.\nAround \u03c10 , the Esym (\u03c1) can be similarly expanded up to 4th-order in \u03c7 as\nKsym 2 Jsym 3 Isym 4\n\u03c7 +\n\u03c7 +\n\u03c7 + O(\u03c75 ),\n(5)\n2!\n3!\n4!\nwhere L, Ksym , Jsym and Isym are the slope parameter, curvature parameter, 3rdorder coefficient, and 4th-order coefficient of the nuclear symmetry energy at \u03c10 .\nWe can also expand the 4th-order nuclear symmetry energy Esym,4 (\u03c1) around \u03c10\nup to 4th-order in \u03c7 as\nEsym (\u03c1) = Esym (\u03c10 ) + L\u03c7 +\n\nKsym,4 2 Jsym,4 3 Isym,4 4\n\u03c7 +\n\u03c7 +\n\u03c7 + O(\u03c75 ), (6)\n2\n3!\n4!\nwith Lsym,4 , Ksym,4 , Jsym,4 and Isym,4 being the slope parameter, curvature parameter, 3rd-order coefficient, and 4th-order coefficient of the 4th-order nuclear\nsymmetry energy Esym,4 (\u03c1) at \u03c10 .\nEsym,4 (\u03c1) = Esym,4 (\u03c10 ) + Lsym,4 \u03c7 +\n\n\fNovember 3, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n4\n\nKiso1117\n\nLie-Wen Chen et al.\n\nConventionally, the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter is defined\nat its saturation density \u03c1sat where P (\u03c1, \u03b4) = 0, thus also called the isobaric incompressibility coefficient 50 , and is given by\n\u2202 2 E(\u03c1, \u03b4)\n(7)\n|\u03c1=\u03c1sat .\n\u2202\u03c12\nIts value depends on the isospin asymmetry \u03b4.

Usually, one can define a finite nucleus incompressibility KA (N, Z) for a nucleus with N neutrons and Z protons (A = N + Z)\nby the GMR energy EGMR , i.e.,\ns\n~2 KA (N, Z)\n,\n(11)\nEGMR =\nm hr2 i\nwhere m is the nucleon mass and r2 is the mean square mass radius of the nucleus\nin the ground state. Similar to the semi-empirical mass formula, the finite nucleus\nincompressibility KA (N, Z) can be expanded as 46\nKA (N, Z) = K0 + Ksurf A\u22121/3 + Kcurv A\u22122/3\n\u00132\n\u0012\nZ2\nN \u2212Z\n\u22121/3\n+KCoul 4/3 + * * *,\n+(K\u03c4 + Kss A\n)\nA\nA\n\n(12)\n\nNeglecting the Kcurv term, the Kss term and other higher-order terms in Eq.

The K\u03c4 parameter is usually thought to be equivalent to the Ksat,2 parameter. However, we would like to stress here that the Ksat,2\n\n\fNovember 3, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nKiso1117\n\nIncompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter\n\n5\n\nparameter is a theoretically well-defined physical property of asymmetric nuclear\nmatter as shown previously while the value of the K\u03c4 parameter may depend on\nthe details of the truncation scheme in Eq.

Therefore, cautions are needed to interpret\nthe K\u03c4 parameter as the Ksat,2 parameter.\n3. Results and discussions\nIn the following, we show our results based on three theoretical models, namely, the\nmodified finite-range Gogny effective interaction (MDI), the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock\n(SHF) approach, and a phenomenological modified Skyrme-like (MSL) model. For\nthe details of these models, we refer readers to Ref. 49 . A very useful feature of\nthese models is that analytical expressions for many interesting physical quantities\nin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature can be obtained, and this makes\nthe study of the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter more transparent.\n3.1.

It is seen that Ksat (\u03b4)\ngenerally decreases with increasing isospin asymmetry.

Corresponding results at smaller isospin asymmetries with \u03b4 2 \u2264 0.1 are given in the\ninsets of Fig. 1, and it shows that the result from keeping up to the \u03b4 2 term approximates very well the exact Ksat (\u03b4) and the contribution of Ksat,4 term is not\nimportant as Ksat (\u03b4) displays a good linear correlation with \u03b4 2 . This feature implies\nthat the absolute value of Ksat,2 is much larger than that of Ksat,4 . Our results are\nalso consistent with the very recent study based on the RMF model 52 .\n3.2. Correlations of J0 -K0 and L-Ksym\nAs shown in Eq. (9), the Ksat,2 parameter is completely determined by the 4 characteristic parameters K0 , J0 , L, and Ksym at the normal nuclear density. While the\nK0 parameter has been relatively well determined to be 240 \u00b1 20 MeV from the\nnuclear GMR data 16,21,22,23,24 , the J0 parameter is poorly known, and there is\nactually no experimental information on the J0 parameter.\n400\nSHF\n\n200\n\nE\n\n=0.9m)\n\n( )=12.3( /\n\nsym\n\n+17.7( /\n\n0\n\n)\n\n2/3\n\n0\n\n) (MeV)\n\n0\n\n(\n\n(MeV)\n\n200\n\n3\n)=\n\ns,0\n\n=m)\n\n(\n\n*\n\nm\n\ns,0\n\ny\n\nMSL (m\n\n*\n\ns\n\nMSL (m\n\n0\n\nE\n\nMDI\n\n0\n\n(MeV)\n\n0\n\nK\n\n)\nV\n\n1\n\ne\n\nJ\n\n0\n\n=0.7m)\n\n-200\n\n-400\nMDI\n\n0\n\nJ /K\n\n0\n\nsym\n\n-400\n\n(M\n\ns,0\n\n=0.8m)\n\n0\n\n*\n\n)\n\nMSL (m\n\n*\ns,0\n\n/\n\nMSL (m\n\n-200\n\nMSL (\n\n-1\n\n-600\n\nMSL (\n\n=4/3)\n\nsym\n\n=5/3)\n\nsym\n\nSHF\n\n-2\n\n-800\n200\n\n250\n\n300\nK\n\n0\n\n(MeV)\n\n350\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nL (MeV)\n\nFig. 2.

Taken from Ref. 49 .\n\nShown in the left panels of Fig. 2 are J0 and J0 /K0 as functions of K0 in\nthe MSL model for different values of the nucleon effective mass m\u2217s,0 = m, 0.9m,\n0.8m and 0.7m. Also included in the figure are corresponding results from the\nMDI interaction and the SHF prediction with 63 Skyrme interactions (see Ref.\n49 for the details). One can see the J /K value deviates significantly from zero\n0\n0\nfor a reasonable K0 value, which implies that the higher order J0 contribution to\nKsat,2 generally cannot be neglected. It is further seen that the correlation between\nJ0 and K0 is similar among these three different models. Also, all three models\n\n\fNovember 3, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nKiso1117\n\nIncompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter\n\n7\n\nshow an approximately linear correlation between J0 /K0 and K0 . We note that the\ncorrelation between J0 and K0 obtained in the present work is consistent with the\nearly finding by Pearson 53 . While there do not exist any empirical constraints on\nthe J0 parameter, we assume here the correlation between J0 and K0 from the MSL\nmodel is valid and then determine J0 /K0 from the experimental constraint on K0 .\nShown in the right panels of Fig. 2 are the correlation between Ksym and L\nfrom the MSL model with \u03b3sym = 4/3 and 5/3, the MDI interaction, the SHF\nprediction with the 63 Skyrme interactions, and two one-parameter parameterizations on the symmetry energies. It is very interesting to see that for larger L values\n(L \u2265 45 MeV which is consistent with the constraint from heavy-ion collision data),\nall above symmetry energy functionals from different models and parameterizations\ngive consistent predictions for the Ksym -L correlation. This nice feature implies that\nusing these different models and parameterizations for the symmetry energy will\nnot influence significantly the determination of the Ksat,2 parameter. On the other\nhand, the Ksym -L correlation from the two one-parameter parameterizations on the\nsymmetry energies deviate significantly from the MDI, MSL and SHF predictions\nfor small L values. Actually, the two forms of one-parameter parametrization for\nthe symmetry energy may be too simple to describe a softer symmetry energy. As\nshown in Ref. 33 , the symmetry energy form Esym (\u03c1) \u2248 31.6(\u03c1/\u03c10 )\u03b3 cannot describe\ncorrectly the density dependence of the symmetry energy from the MDI interaction\nwith x = 1 (the Gogny interaction). Although there is no direct empirical information on the Ksym parameter and some uncertainty on the Ksym -L correlation\nstill exist, we assume here that the correlation between Ksym and L from the MSL\nmodel with \u03b3sym = 4/3 and 5/3 is valid and then use the experimental constraint\non L to extract the value of Ksym .\n3.3. Constraining the Ksat,2 parameter\nFrom above analyses, we can now extract information on the Ksat,2 parameter from\nthe experimental constraints on the K0 parameter and the L parameter. Results on\nKsat,2 as a function of L are shown in Fig.3 for \u03b3sym = 4/3 (panel (a)) and 5/3 (panel\n(b)) and with K0 = 220, 240, and 260 MeV. In the MSL model, the correlation\nbetween Ksym and L also depends on Esym (\u03c10 ) 49 . To take into consideration\nof the uncertainty in the value of Esym (\u03c10 ), we also include in Fig.3 the results\nwith K0 = 220 MeV and Esym (\u03c10 ) = 25 MeV as well as K0 = 260 MeV and\nEsym (\u03c10 ) = 35 MeV, which represent, respectively, the upper and lower bounds\non Ksat,2 for a fixed value of L. The shaded region in Fig. 3 further shows the\nconstrained L values from heavy-ion collision data, namely, 46 MeV \u2264 L \u2264 111\nMeV. The lower limit of L = 46 MeV is obtained from the lower bound in the\nImQMD analyses of the isospin diffusion data and the double neutron/proton ratio\n38 while the upper limit of L = 111 MeV corresponds to the upper bound of L\nfrom the IBUU04 transport model analysis of the isospin diffusion data 32,33,35,34 .\nWe note that the constraint 46 MeV \u2264 L \u2264 111 MeV obtained from heavy-ion\n\n\fNovember 3, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n8\n\nKiso1117\n\nLie-Wen Chen et al.\n\n-200\n\n(a) MSL with\n\nE\n\nsym\n\n(\n\n-300\n\nsym\n\n0\n\n=4/3\n\n(b) MSL with\n\n) = 25\nMeV,\nK\n\n0\n\nK\n\n(\nE sym\n\n= 220\nMeV\n0\n\nK\n\n-400\n\n=5/3\n\n) =\n\n25\n\nM\n\ne\n\n0\n\nHIC data\n\n) = 30\nMeV\n\n0\n\nE\nsy\n\nm\n\n26\n\n(\n0\n\n-500\n\n) =\n\n35\n\nM\n\neV\n\n, K\n0\n\nGMR of Sn Isotopes:\nK =550\n\n-600\n\n0\n\n0\n\n26\n\n0\n\nM\n\nK =550\n\n100\n\n) =\n\n0\n\nM\n\n30\n\n0\n\n=\n\n22\n\n0\n\nM\n\neV\n\nM\n\neV\n\neV\n\n0\n\n(\n\nsym\n\n150\n\nV\n5 Me\n) = 3\n\neV\n260 M\n, K0 =\n\n0\n\nGMR of Sn Isotopes:\n\neV\n\n100 MeV\n\n50\n\nK0\n\n22\n\n260\n\n100 MeV\n\nSHF: squares\n\n-50\n\n(\nE sym\n\n=\n\n24\n\nE\n\n=\n\nK0\nV,\n\n= 220\nMeV\n\n240\n\nsat,2\n\n(MeV)\n\nHIC dataEsym (\n\nsym\n\nSHF: squares\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nL (MeV)\n\nFig. 3.

Taken from Ref. 49 .\n\ncollisions is consistent with the analyses of the pygmy dipole resonances 45 , the giant\ndipole resonance (GDR) of 208 Pb analyzed with Skyrme interactions 44 , the very\nprecise Thomas-Fermi model fit to the binding energies of 1654 nuclei 42 , and the\nrecent neutron-skin analysis 54 . These empirically extracted values of L represent\nthe best and most stringent phenomenological constraints available so far on the\nnuclear symmetry energy at sub-saturation densities. It should be mentioned that\nthe proposed experiment of parity-violating electron scattering from 208 Pb at the\nJefferson Laboratory is expected to give an independent and accurate measurement\nof its neutron skin thickness (within 0.05 fm) 55,56 and thus to impose a stringent\nconstraint on the slope parameter L in future.\nFrom the shaded region indicated in Fig. 3, we find that for \u03b3sym = 4/3, we have\n\u2212437 MeV \u2264 Ksat,2 \u2264 \u2212292 MeV for L = 46 MeV and \u2212487 MeV \u2264 Ksat,2 \u2264 \u2212306\nMeV for L = 111 MeV. These values are changed to \u2212477 MeV \u2264 Ksat,2 \u2264 \u2212302\nMeV for L = 46 MeV and \u2212461 MeV \u2264 Ksat,2 \u2264 \u2212251 MeV for L = 111 MeV when\n\u03b3sym = 5/3 is used. Our results thus indicate that based on the MSL model with\n4/3 \u2264 \u03b3sym \u2264 5/3, K0 = 240 \u00b1 20 MeV, 25 MeV \u2264 Esym (\u03c10 ) \u2264 35 MeV, and 46\nMeV \u2264 L \u2264 111 MeV, the Ksat,2 parameter can vary from \u2212251 MeV to \u2212487 MeV.\nThe results shown in Fig. 3 is obtained from a J0 /K0 value that is evaluated with\nthe default value m\u2217s,0 = 0.8m in the MSL model. Similar analyses indicate that\n\n\fNovember 3, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nKiso1117\n\nIncompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter\n\n9\n\nthe Ksat,2 parameter varies from \u2212261 MeV to \u2212489 MeV if we use m\u2217s,0 = 0.7m\nwhile it varies from \u2212245 MeV to \u2212485 MeV if m\u2217s,0 = 0.9m is used. Therefore, the\nextracted value for Ksat,2 is not sensitive to the variation of the nucleon effective\nmass. The MSL model analyses with 4/3 \u2264 \u03b3sym \u2264 5/3, K0 = 240 \u00b1 20 MeV,\nEsym (\u03c10 ) = 30 \u00b1 5 MeV, 46 MeV \u2264 L \u2264 111 MeV, and m\u2217s,0 = 0.8 \u00b1 0.1m thus\nlead to an estimate value of Ksat,2 = \u2212370 \u00b1 120 MeV for the 2nd-order parameter\nin the isospin asymmetry expansion of the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear\nmatter at its saturation density.\n4. Summary and conclusions\nWe have studied the incompressibility of an asymmetric nuclear matter at its saturation density. We find that in its power series expansion in isospin asymmetry\nthe magnitude of the 4th-order Ksat,4 parameter is generally small compared to\nthat of the 2nd-order Ksat,2 parameter, so the latter essentially characterizes the\nisospin dependence of the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter at saturation density. Furthermore, the Ksat,2 parameter can be uniquely determined by\nthe slope L and the curvature Ksym of nuclear symmetry energy at normal nuclear\nmatter density and the ratio J0 /K0 of the 3rd-order and incompressibility coefficients of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density, and we find the higher\norder J0 contribution to Ksat,2 generally cannot be neglected. Since there is no\nexperimental information on the J0 parameter and the Ksym parameter, we have\nthus used the MSL model, which can reasonably describe the general properties of\nsymmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy predicted by both the MDI\nmodel and the SHF approach, to estimate the value of Ksat,2 . Interestingly, we find\nthat there exists a nicely linear correlation between Ksym and L as well as between\nJ0 /K0 and K0 for the three different models used here, i.e., the MDI interaction,\nthe MSL interaction, and the SHF approach with 63 Skyrme interactions. These\ncorrelations have allowed us to extract the values of the J0 parameter and the Ksym\nparameter from the empirical information on K0 , L and Esym (\u03c10 ). In particular,\nusing the empirical constraints of K0 = 240 \u00b1 20 MeV, Esym (\u03c10 ) = 30 \u00b1 5 MeV, 46\nMeV \u2264 L \u2264 111 MeV and a nucleon effective mass m\u2217s,0 = 0.8 \u00b1 0.1m in the MSL\nmodel leads to an estimate of Ksat,2 = \u2212370 \u00b1 120 MeV.\nWhile the estimated value of Ksat,2 = \u2212370 \u00b1 120 MeV in the present work has\nsmall overlap with the constraint of K\u03c4 = \u2212550\u00b1100 MeV for the symmetry term in\na semi-empirical mass formula-like expansion of the incompressibility of finite nuclei\nobtained in Refs. 22,23 from recent measurements of the isotopic dependence of the\nGMR in even-A Sn isotopes, its magnitude is significantly smaller than that of the\nconstrained K\u03c4 . Recently, there are several studies 57,58,52 on extracting the value\nof the Ksat,2 parameter based on the idea initiated by Blaizot and collaborators\nthat the values of both K0 and Ksat,2 should be extracted from the same consistent\ntheoretical model that successfully reproduces the experimental GMR energies of a\nvariety of nuclei. These studies show that no single model (interaction) can simul-\n\n\fNovember 3, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n10\n\nKiso1117\n\nLie-Wen Chen et al.\n\ntaneously describe the recent measurements of the isotopic dependence of the GMR\nin even-A Sn isotopes and the GMR data of 90 Zr and 208 Pb nuclei, and this makes\nit difficult to accurately determine the value of Ksat,2 from these data. Also, a very\nrecent study 59 indicates that the effect due to the nuclear superfluidity may also\naffect the extraction of the Ksat,2 parameter from the nuclear GMR. As pointed\nout in Ref. 52 , these features suggest that the K\u03c4 = \u2212550 \u00b1 100 MeV obtained\nin Ref. 22,23 may suffer from the same ambiguities already encountered in earlier\nattempts to extract the K0 and Ksat,2 of infinite nuclear matter from finite-nuclei\nextrapolations. This problem remains an open challenge, and both experimental\nand theoretical insights are needed in future studies.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the NNSF of China under Grant Nos. 10575071\nand 10675082, MOE of China under project NCET-05-0392, Shanghai RisingStar Program under Grant No. 06QA14024, the SRF for ROCS, SEM of China,\nthe National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) under Contract\nNo. 2007CB815004, the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY0652548, PHY-0757839 and PHY-0758115, the Welch Foundation under Grant No.\nA-1358, the Research Corporation under Award No. 7123 and the Texas Coordinating Board of Higher Education Award No. 003565-0004-2007.\nReferences\n1.
