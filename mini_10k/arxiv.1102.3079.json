Introduction\nIn 2008, Ito and Sadahiro [3], introduced a numeration system\n\u0011 base\nh with negative\n\u03b2\n1\n\u2212\u03b2, where \u03b2 > 1. It has been shown that every number x \u2208 I = \u2212 \u03b2+1 , \u03b2+1 can be\nwritten in the form\nx=\n\n\u221e\nX\ni=1\n\nxi\n,\n(\u2212\u03b2)i\n\nxi \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , \u230a\u03b2\u230b} .\n\nThe string of digits d(x) = x1 x2 x3 * * * , which we call here Ito-Sadahiro expansion of x,\ncan be obtained by the transformation T : I 7\u2192 I defined by\nj\nT (x) = \u2212\u03b2x \u2212 \u2212 \u03b2x +\n\n\u03b2 k\n.\n\u03b2+1\n\nThe digits of the string d(x) are then given by\nxi =\n\nj\n\n\u2212 \u03b2T i\u22121(x) +\n\n\u03b2 k\n,\n\u03b2+1\n\ni.e. xi lie in the alphabet A = {0, 1, . . . , \u230a\u03b2\u230b}\nThe natural ordering of reals in the interval I is preserved by Ito-Sadahiro expansion, when considering the alternate order \u0016alt on the set of digit strings over an\nordered alphabet A. We say that x1 x2 x3 * * * \u227aalt y1 y2 y3 * * * if the first non-zero element\nof the sequence (\u22121)i (yi \u2212 xi ), i \u2265 1, is positive.\nThe Ito-Sadahiro numeration system shares many properties of numeration with\npositive (in general non-integer) base considered by R\u00e9nyi [11] and then by many\nothers from different points of view. The main advantage of considering negative base\nis the possibility of representing every real number with the same set of digits without\nPreprint submitted to Theoretical Computer Science\n\nNovember 14, 2018\n\n\fthe use of sign. On the other hand, many aspects of number system with negative\nbase are different and essentially more complicated, as an example, let us mention the\nstructure of (\u2212\u03b2)-integers which is studied in [1] and [13].\nSimilarly as in case of number representation using a positive base, not every string\nof digits from the alphabet A = {0, 1, . . . , \u230a\u03b2\u230b} appears as the expansion d(x) of some\nx \u2208 I. Ito and Sadahiro [3] have shown that a necessary and sufficient condition so\nthat x1 x2 x3 * * * be equal to d(x) for some x is that\n\u0010 \u2212\u03b2 \u0011\n\u0010 1 \u0011\n\u2217\nd\n\u0016alt xi xi+1 xi+2 * * * \u227aalt d\n\u03b2+1\n\u03b2+1\nwhere\n\nfor all i = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u0010 1\n\u0011\n\u0010 1 \u0011\n= lim d\n\u2212\u03b5 .\nd\n\u03b5\u21920+\n\u03b2+1\n\u03b2+1\n\u2217\n\nThe upper and lower bounds deciding about admissibility of a digit string x1 x2 x3 * * * as\nthe Ito-Sadahiro expansion are closely related. If\u0001 the lower bound is a purely periodic\n\u03b2\ndigit string with odd period-length, i.e. d \u2212 \u03b2+1\n= (d1 d2 * * * d2q+1 )\u03c9 , where w \u03c9 stands\n\u0001\n\u0001\u03c9\n1\n= 0d1 d2 * * * d2q (d2q+1 \u2212 1) . Othfor infinite repetition of the string w, then d\u2217 \u03b2+1\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n1\n1\nerwise, d\u2217 \u03b2+1\n= 0d \u2212 \u03b2+1\n. Such a close relation of d \u2212 \u03b2+1\nand d\u2217 \u03b2+1\nallowed to\nshow that the (\u2212\u03b2)-shift is sofic if and only if the lower bound is eventually periodic [3].\nFrougny and Lai [4] have shown that for \u03b2 Pisot number ever element of Q(\u03b2) \u2229 I has\neventually periodic Ito-Sadahiro expansion, and so for such \u03b2, the (\u2212\u03b2)-shift is sofic.\nUsing base \u2212\u03b2, Ito and Sadahiro have represented only numbers within the interval\nx\nI. Since for every x \u2208 R there exists k \u2208 Z such that (\u2212\u03b2)\nk \u2208 I, every x \u2208 R can be\nwritten in the form\nx = xk (\u2212\u03b2)k + xk\u22121 (\u2212\u03b2)k\u22121 + xk\u22122 (\u2212\u03b2)k\u22122 + * * * ,\nwhere any suffix of the digit string xk xk\u22121 xk\u22122 * * * verifies the condition (1). The use\nof negative base thus allows one to represent every real number using the same set of\ndigits {0, 1, . . . , \u230a\u03b2\u230b}. A disadvantage is that the representation of x has no obvious\nrelation to the representation of \u2212x. More serious from the practical point of view is,\nx\nhowever, the fact that the digit strings for representation of x and \u2212\u03b2\ncan substantially\ndiffer (see discussion in Example 5). Recall that in a number system with positive base\n\u03b1, the representation of \u03b1x is always obtained from the representation of x by shifting\nthe fractional point. Among the disadvantages from the arithmetical point of view, we\ncan mention that for some bases \u2212\u03b2, the number zero is the only element of I for which\nthe Ito-Sadahiro expansion has only finitely many non-zero digits. In the positive base\nnumber systems such phenomenon does not occur.\nIn their paper, Ito and Sadahiro do not explain\nh the reasons\n\u0011 for choosing for repre\u03b2\n1\nsentation the transformation T with domain I = \u2212 \u03b2+1 , \u03b2+1 . The aim of this paper\nis to discuss the influence of the choice of the domain on the properties of the resulting number system. Similar study for the positive base with focus on the dynamical\naspects and tilings has been performed in [7].\nWe consider the following generalization of the Ito-Sadahiro expansion.\n\n2\n\n\fDefinition 1. For a given real number \u03b2 > 1 and l \u2208 (\u22121, 0] we define the mapping\nT : I 7\u2192 I with domain I := [l, l + 1), by the prescription\nT (x) := \u2212\u03b2x \u2212 \u230a\u2212\u03b2x \u2212 l\u230b ,\n\nfor x \u2208 I.\n\n(2)\n\nThe mapping T will be called the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-transformation. To every x \u2208 I we associate\nan infinite string of integer digits d(x) = x1 x2 x3 * * * by\nxi := \u230a\u2212\u03b2T i\u22121 (x) \u2212 l\u230b ,\n\nfor any i = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\n\n(3)\n\nThe mapping d : I 7\u2192 ZN will be called the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion. The string d(x) is the\n(\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion of x \u2208 I.\nThe paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2 we recall the properties of\nnumber systems with positive real base. In Section 3 we study number representation\nin a system with negative base from a general point of view, based on theorem of\nThurston [14], see Theorem 3. We explain in what sense our choice of transformation\nT is general. In section 4 we focus on the properties of the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-transformation\nand study how the choice of its domain influences certain aspects of the corresponding\nnumber system. In Section 5 we characterize for fixed \u03b2 and l the family of strings in\nZN which are (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions of some x. Analogously to the case of Ito-Sadahiro\nexpansions, we use the alternate order on ZN and two reference digit strings denoted by\nd(l) and d\u2217 (r). In Section 6 we show which property of the transformation T connects\nthese two strings. We also describe some of their properties and discuss the question\nwhich digit strings may play the role of the reference strings d(l) and d\u2217 (r) for some\n\u03b2 and l. Finally, in Section 7 we prove that periodicity of (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions relates\nto the notion of Pisot and Salem numbers, as it is the case of positive base number\nsystems.\n2. Representing reals using a positive base\nLet us briefly recall several facts about numeration in positive base number systems\nfor which we try to find analogues in the case of systems with negative base associated\nwith (\u2212\u03b2, l)-transformation. For a real number \u03b2 > 1, R\u00e9nyi in [11] has considered\nthe transformation T\u03b2 (x) := \u03b2x \u2212 \u230a\u03b2x\u230b of the interval [0, 1). One can represent every\nnumber x \u2208 [0, 1) in the form\nx=\n\n\u221e\nX\nxi\ni=1\n\n\u03b2i\n\n,\n\n\b\nxi \u2208 0, 1, . . . , \u2308\u03b2\u2309 \u2212 1 .\n\nwhere the digits xi , i \u2265 1 are obtained by\nj\nk\nxi = \u03b2T\u03b2i\u22121 (x) .\n\nThe string of these digits is denoted d\u03b2 (x) = x1 x2 x3 * * * and called the \u03b2-expansion of\nx. One can define the \u03b2-expansion of every positive real number x by \u0001dividing x by\na suitable power of \u03b2 so that \u03b2xk \u2208 [0, 1), finding the \u03b2-expansion d\u03b2 \u03b2xk and shifting\nthe fractional point.\n3\n\n\f\b\nNot every infinite string with digits in 0, 1, . . . , \u230a\u03b2\u230b is admissible as a \u03b2-expansion\nof some x \u2208 [0, 1). The characterization of the admissible digit strings uses the lexicographic order \u0016lex and the infinite R\u00e9nyi \u03b2-expansion of 1, namely the string\nd\u2217\u03b2 (1) = lim d\u03b2 (1 \u2212 \u03b5) .\n\u03b5\u21920+\n\nHere we make use of the fact that the space AN of infinite words over any finite\nalphabet A is compact with respect to the product topology. The limit of a sequence\nof digit strings which have longer and longer common prefixes thus can be defined. The\nnecessary and sufficient condition for admissibility of digit strings was formulated by\nParry [10].\nTheorem 2 (Parry). Let \u03b2 > 1. The string x1 x2 x3 * * * of integer digits is a \u03b2-expansion\nof some x \u2208 [0, 1) if and only if every suffix xi xi+1 xi+2 * * * of x1 x2 x3 * * * satisfies\n0\u03c9 \u0016lex xi xi+1 xi+2 * * * \u227alex d\u2217\u03b2 (1) .\n\n(4)\n\nAs a consequence of the above theorem, Parry has also given a criterion for sequences of digit strings which can play role of the R\u00e9nyi \u03b2-expansion of 1 for some \u03b2.\nIn fact, a sequence of integers x1 x2 x3 * * * is equal to d\u2217\u03b2 (1) for some \u03b2 > 1 if and only\nif every suffix xi xi+1 xi+2 * * * satisfies\n0\u03c9 \u0016lex xi xi+1 xi+2 * * * \u0016lex x1 x2 x3 * * * .\nFor a fixed \u03b2 > 1, the \u03b2-shift is the closure of the set of infinite sequences appearing\nas \u03b2-expansions of numbers in [0, 1), which is a shift-invariant subspace of the space of\nall infinite sequences over the same alphabet. Such a dynamical system is sofic, if the\nset of its finite factors is recognized by a finite automaton. This is equivalent to saying\nthat the reference string d\u2217\u03b2 (1), which is plays a crucial role in Theorem 2, is eventually\nperiodic. The base \u03b2 leading to a sofic \u03b2-shift\na Parry number. Here, the\nP\u221eis xcalled\ni\nnumber 1 is expressed as a power series 1 = i=1 \u03b2 i , where the integer coefficients xi\nform an eventually periodic sequence, then \u03b2 is a root of a monic polynomial in Z[X],\nand so every Parry number is an algebraic integer.\nWhen studying the positive base number systems from the arithmetical point of\nview, one is mainly interested in the set Fin(\u03b2) of numbers with finite \u03b2-expansions,\nin particular, in the set of numbers x \u2208 [0, 1) such that d\u03b2 (x) ends in 0\u03c9 . This set is\nalways infinite. One can also study which numbers have eventually periodic expansion\nd\u03b2 (x). Two classes of algebraic numbers prove to be of particular interest, namely Pisot\nand Salem numbers. Pisot numbers are algebraic integers > 1 whose all conjugates\nare in modulus < 1, Salem numbers are algebraic integers whose all conjugates are in\nmodulus \u2264 1, with at least one unimodular conjugate. Being a Pisot number turns out\nto be a necessary condition for the base so that the set Fin(\u03b2) has a ring structure [5],\nit allows to construct fractal tilings [2], etc. It is also known [10] that all Pisot numbers\nare Parry numbers. The question whether Salem numbers are Parry numbers has been\nonly solved for Salem numbers of small degree. Schmidt [12] shows that Pisot numbers\nshare in some sense the properties of natural numbers, since for Pisot bases \u03b2 the set\nof numbers in [0, 1) with eventually periodic \u03b2-expansions is equal to Q(\u03b2) \u2229 [0, 1). On\nthe other hand, if every x \u2208 Q(\u03b2) \u2229 [0, 1) has eventually periodic d\u03b2 (x) then \u03b2 is either\nPisot or Salem.\n4\n\n\f3. Representing reals using a negative base\nLet us approach the question of representing numbers using powers of a basis from\na more general point of view. Thurston [14] stated the following simple theorem.\nTheorem 3 (Thurston). Given \u03b1 \u2208 C, |\u03b1| > 1, a finite alphabet A \u2282 C and a bounded\nset V \u2282 C such that\n[\n\u03b1V \u2282\n(V + a) .\n(5)\na\u2208A\n\nThen for every z \u2208 V there exists a sequence a1 a2 a3 * * * \u2208 AN such that\n\u221e\nX\nai\n.\nz=\n\u03b1i\ni=1\n\n(6)\n\nIf, moreover, the point 0 lies in the interior of V , then every z \u2208 C can be written in\nthe form\nz = bk \u03b1k + bk\u22121 \u03b1k\u22121 + bk\u22122 \u03b1k\u22122 + * * *\n\nfor some k \u2208 Z and bi \u2208 A.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is simple and constructive, we give it here for the purpose\nof discussion of uniqueness of the sequence a1 a2 a3 * * * dependently on the choice of the\nset V and the alphabet A.\nProof. Consider z \u2208 V . According to (5), there exist z1 \u2208 V and a1 \u2208 A such that\n\u03b1z = z1 + a1 , i.e. z = a\u03b11 + z\u03b11 . Again, by (5), there exist z2 \u2208 V and a2 \u2208 A such that\n\u03b1z1 = z2 + a2 , i.e. z = a\u03b11 + \u03b1a22 + \u03b1z22 . This procedure can be repeated, so that after the\nn-th step we obtain\nz=\n\na2\nan\nzn\na1\n+ 2 +***+ n + n ,\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\nwhere zn \u2208 V and a1 , . . . , an \u2208 A.\n\nAs V is bounded and |\u03b1| > 1, we have easily lim \u03b1znn = 0, which proves the first\nn\u2192\u221e\nstatement of the theorem. The second statement follows easily from the following\nfact. Since 0 belongs to the interior of V , one can find for every z \u2208 C an exponent\nk \u2208 ZPsuch that \u03b1zk \u2208 V . The first statement ensures existence of a representation\nai\nz\n= \u221e\ni=1 \u03b1i .\n\u03b1k\n\nWe shall use the above method for representing real numbers x by powers of a\nnegative base \u03b1 = \u2212\u03b2, \u03b2 > 1. We will, moreover, require the following:\n\n1. The region V is a bounded interval I \u2282 R;\nP\nai\n2. the expression x = \u221e\ni=1 (\u2212\u03b2)i from the theorem is unique for every x \u2208 V ;\n3. the alphabet A \u2282 R is minimal in the sense that for every a \u2208 A there is an\nx \u2208 R in whose representation a1 a2 a3 * * * the letter a appears at least once.\nS\nRequirement 2. implies that \u2212\u03b2I \u2282 a\u2208A (I + a), where the union is disjoint. By\nrequirement 1. the set \u2212\u03b2I is an interval, which together with the disjointness means\nthat I is a semi-closed interval and, moreover, the intervals I + a, a \u2208 A, concur\nwithout gaps and overlaps. Denoting m = min A, we obtain using requirement 3. that\nA = {m, m + |I|, m + 2|I|, . . . , m + (#A \u2212 1)|I|}, where |I| denotes the length of the\n5\n\n\finterval I. Since (5) remains valid when scaling both V and A by the same fixed factor,\nwe can, without loss of generality, set |I| = 1 and I = [l, r) for some l \u2208 R, r = l + 1. In\nsuch a case, the alphabet is of the form A = {m + k | k = 0, 1, . . . , #A \u2212 1}. Imposing\nanother requirement,\n4. A \u2282 Z,\nthe alphabet A becomes a finite set of consecutive integers.\nNow one can provide a simple prescription which to a given x assigns the first digit\na1 and the remainder z1 ,\n\u2212\u03b2x \u2208 [l, r) + a1\n\n\u21d4\n\nl + a1 \u2264 \u2212\u03b2x < r + a1\n\n\u21d4\n\n\u2212\u03b2x \u2212 r < a1 \u2264 \u2212\u03b2x \u2212 l .\n\nSince a1 \u2208 Z, we obtain a1 = \u230a\u2212\u03b2x \u2212 l\u230b and z1 = \u2212\u03b2x \u2212 a1 = \u2212\u03b2x \u2212 \u230a\u2212\u03b2x \u2212 l\u230b. Note\nthat z1 = T (x), where T is the transformation defined in (2) and a1 = x1 from (3).\nThe digits take values in the alphabet\nn\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0004\n\u0005o\nA\u2212\u03b2,l :=\n(7)\n\u2212 l(\u03b2 + 1) \u2212 \u03b2 , . . . , \u2212 l(\u03b2 + 1) .\nwhich depends on l and \u03b2. Thus for any \u03b2 and l, the digits in the numeration system\nform a bounded set of P consecutive integers where P = \u230a\u03b2\u230b + 1 or P = \u230a\u03b2\u230b + 2.\nOne may impose some further natural requirements on the number system:\n\n\u2022 That the digits can take the value 0. For that, we need that \u2212l(\u03b2 + 1) \u2212 \u03b2 < 1\nand \u2212l(\u03b2 + 1) \u2265 0, which is equivalent to \u22121 < l \u2264 0, i.e. 0 \u2208 [l, r).\n\u2022 That the expansion of 0 is equal to d(0) = 000 * * * = 0\u03c9 . This is satisfied if 0 is a\nfixed point of the transformation T , for which we need \u230a\u2212l\u230b = 0 = T (0), which\nagain gives the condition 0 \u2208 [l, r).\n\u2022 That the numeration system can be extended to represent not only numbers from\n[l, r) but all reals. Here we need that every real number can be multiplied by an\ninteger power of \u2212\u03b2 so that it falls within the interval [l, r). Again, one gets the\ncondition 0 \u2208 [l, r).\nThe above items justify our choice of considering \u22121 < l \u2264 0, which we impose\nthroughout the paper. Note that one can derive by simple algebraic manipulation that\nthe digits in the alphabet (7) are then bounded by \u2308\u03b2\u2309 in modulus.\n4. The (\u2212\u03b2, l)-transformation T\nLet us now see how the choice of the domain [l, l + 1) = [l, r) of the transformation\nT influences the properties of the resulting numeration system, or, on the other hand,\nhow further requirements on the numeration system limit the choice of l.\nOne may prefer that the digits are all non-negative, as it is the case of R\u00e9nyi\nexpansions with positive base. Such a condition is equivalent to the requirement \u2212l(\u03b2 +\n\u03b2\n1) \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 0, which implies l \u2265 \u2212 \u03b2+1\n. When, moreover, one requires the digits to be\n\n. Putting\nsmaller or equal to \u03b2, we must ask for \u2212l(\u03b2 + 1) < \u230a\u03b2\u230b + 1, i.e. l < \u2212 \u230a\u03b2\u230b+1\n\u03b2+1\ntogether, we have the following remark.\n6\n\n\fRemark 4. The numeration system with negative base \u2212\u03b2 given by the transformation (2) gives representation of numbers over the digit set {0, 1, . . . , \u230a\u03b2\u230b} if and only if\nthe left end-point of the domain I = [l, r) of T satisfies\n\u2212\n\n\u03b2\n\u230a\u03b2\u230b + 1\n\u2264l<\u2212\n.\n\u03b2+1\n\u03b2+1\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b2\nensures that (8) is satisfied universally for all \u03b2. Such\nExample 5. Putting l = \u2212 \u03b2+1\nchoice of l corresponds to the number system introduced in [3] by Ito and Sadahiro.

On the other hand, it brings one non-desirable phenomena. Just as in the\nusual positional number systems, we would expect that multiplying by a power of the\nbase only shifts the digit string representing the number. So it would be natural to ask\nthat\n\u0010 x \u0011\n= 0k x1 x2 x3 * * * .\nif d(x) = x1 x2 x3 * * * ,\nthen d\n(\u2212\u03b2)k\n\u0002 \u03b2\n\u0001\n1\nThis is however not true for all x \u2208 \u2212 \u03b2+1\n, \u03b2+1\nin the Ito-Sadahiro numeration system.\n\u03b2\nNamely, taking for x the boundary point l = \u2212 \u03b2+1\nand denoting d(l) = l1 l2 l3 * * * , we\n\u22122\nhave (\u2212\u03b2) l \u2208 [l, r) but\n\u0010 l \u0011\n= 1l1 l2 l3 * * * ,\nd\n(\u2212\u03b2)2\nas can be verified easily using (9).\nThe non-desirable phenomena occurring in the Ito-Sadahiro numeration system is\ncaused by the fact that in the interval [l, r) there is an element, namely l itself, which\ndivided by \u2212\u03b2 falls outside of [l, r). Such phenomena can be avoided choosing such l\nthat for given \u03b2 the following implication holds\nx\nx \u2208 [l, r)\n=\u21d2\n\u2208 [l, r) .\n(10)\n\u2212\u03b2\n\nx\n) = x for all x \u2208 [l, r).

Due to the latter property, we\nmay call the numeration system with l = \u2212 21 the balanced system.\nA very important practical requirement for the numeration system is that the set of\nnumbers with finite expansions is non-trivial. A number is said to have finite (\u2212\u03b2, l)expansion if d(x) ends in 0\u03c9 . We denote the set of such numbers by Fin(\u2212\u03b2, l). As we\nhave explained above, 0 \u2208 Fin(\u2212\u03b2, l) for any \u03b2 > 1 and any l such that 0 \u2208 [l, r). We\ncan then write\nFin(\u2212\u03b2, l) = {x \u2208 [l, r) | T n (x) = 0 for some n \u2208 N} .\nHowever, for some choices of l there are no other elements with finite (\u2212\u03b2, l)expansion besides zero. The following proposition characterizes the numeration systems\nfor which this does not happen.\nProposition 8. The necessary and sufficient condition for Fin(\u2212\u03b2, l) to be different\nfrom {0} is that\n1\n1\n(13)\n\u2212 or \u2208 [l, r) .\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nProof. If a non-zero number belongs to Fin(\u2212\u03b2, l) = {x \u2208 [l, r) | T n (x) = 0 for some n \u2208\nN}, then necessarily, there exists a non-zero number y \u2208 [l, r) such that T (y) = 0. Since\na\nT (y) = \u2212\u03b2y \u2212 \u230a\u2212\u03b2y \u2212 l\u230b, the pre-images of 0 in the interval [l, r) are of the form \u2212\u03b2\na\nfor some integer a. On the other hand, T ( \u2212\u03b2\n) = a \u2212 \u230aa \u2212 l\u230b = 0 for all a such that\na\na\n\u2208 [r, l). Obviously, \u2212\u03b2 \u2208 [r, l) for some non-zero integer a if and only if \u03b21 or \u2212 \u03b21\n\u2212\u03b2\nbelongs to [l, r).\n\n8\n\n\fConsider the Ito-Sadahiro numeration system. Here the condition (13) gives Fin \u2212\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u03b2\n6= {0} if and only if \u03b2 \u2265 \u03c4 , where \u03c4 = 21 (1+ 5) is the golden ratio, as already\n\u03b2, \u2212 \u03b2+1\n\u0001\nmentioned in [9]. In the balanced numeration system we have Fin \u2212 \u03b2, \u2212 12 6= {0}\nif and only if \u03b2 \u2265 2. On the other hand, we can choose a system which for any \u03b2\nprovides a non-trivial set of finite expansions. Such a system is obtained for example\nif l = \u2212 \u03b21 . Unfortunatelly, now the condition (11) for uniqueness of the representation\nof numbers is not universally satisfied. In particular, it is valid if and only if \u03b2 > \u03c4 .\nLet us now study the properties of the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-transformation T of the interval [l, r)\nin more depth. These properties will mainly be used in the proof of Theorem 15. From\nthe prescription T (x) = \u2212\u03b2x \u2212 \u230a\u2212\u03b2x \u2212 l\u230b using integer part we derive that, on its\ndomain, T is always continuous from the left, but there are discontinuity points in\nwhich T is discontinuous from the right, namely\n\u001b\n\u001a\na+l\na \u2208 A\u2212\u03b2,l .\n(14)\nD=\n\u2212\u03b2\n\nFor illustration of the graph of T see Figure 1. It is obvious that for a discontinuity\n\u2208 D, we have\npoint x = a+l\n\u2212\u03b2\n\u0016\n\u0017\na+l\na+l\nT (x) = \u2212\u03b2\n\u2212 \u2212\u03b2\n\u2212l = l.\n\u2212\u03b2\n\u2212\u03b2\n\nMoreover, we easily realize that\n\nT (x) = l\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nx \u2208 D.\n\n(15)\n\nThe domain [l, r) of the transformation T is divided by the discontinuity points\nD into disjoint intervals Ia , a \u2208 A\u2212\u03b2,l , in such a way that for every x \u2208 Ia , the first\ndigit x1 in the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion of x is equal to a. Note that for the maximal digit\na = d1 , the interval Id1 is closed, degenerate or non-degenerate. On the other hand,\nfor the minimal digit a, the interval Ia is open. For the other digits, we always have\nthe interval Ia of the form (*, *].\nFrom the prescription (2) we easily derive that fixed points of the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-transformation\na\nare precisely the points fa := \u2212 \u03b2+1\n, where a is a digit in A\u2212\u03b2,l . We thus have d(fa ) = a\u03c9\nfor every a \u2208 A\u2212\u03b2,l . Obviously, we have fa \u2208 Ia and, moreover, fa is in most cases an\ninner point of Ia . In fact, it can lie on the boundary of Ia only if\n\u230a\u2212\u03b2(fa + \u03b5) \u2212 l\u230b < \u230a\u2212\u03b2fa \u2212 l\u230b = a\n\nfor any \u03b5 > 0 ,\n\nand this happens only if \u2212\u03b2fa \u2212 l = a, i.e. l = fa . In such a case, a is the maximal digit\nand Ia is a degenerate interval, and thus the digit a occurs in the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion of\nonly countably many numbers in the domain [l, r). It follows that always at least two\namong the intervals Ia , a \u2208 A\u2212\u03b2,l are non-degenerate.\nConsider a \u2208 A\u2212\u03b2,l such that Ia is non-degenerate. The corresponding fixed point\nfa of the transformation T is an inner point of Ia , i.e. T is continuous on some neighborhood of fa . We can derive that for every n \u2208 N there exists a positive \u03b4n satisfying\nT i (fa \u2212 \u03b4n , fa + \u03b4n ) \u2282 Ia for i = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.

Alternate order and admissible (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions\nLet us show that, just as in the case of Ito-Sadahiro expansions, the alternate order\non digit strings d(x) corresponds to the natural order of real numbers in the interval\n[l, r).\nTheorem 10. Alternate order on (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions preserves the natural order on\nthe interval [l, r), i.e. for x, y \u2208 [l, r) with (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions d(x) and d(y) we have\nx<y\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nd(x) \u227aalt d(y) .\n\nProof. For x, y \u2208 [l, r) with (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions d(x) = x1 x2 x3 * * * and d(y) = y1 y2 y3 * * *\nwe will show that\nx<y\n\u21d0\u21d2\nxm (\u22121)m < ym (\u22121)m ,\n\nwhere m := min{k \u2208 N | xk 6= yk }. From the definition of m and the construction of\n(\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions it follows that there exist x\u0303, \u1ef9 \u2208 [l, r) and z \u2208 R such that\nx=z+\n\n1\n1\nx\u0303 and y = z +\n\u1ef9 ,\nm\u22121\n(\u2212\u03b2)\n(\u2212\u03b2)m\u22121\n\nwhere xm xm+1 xm+2 * * * , ym ym+1 ym+2 * * * are the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions of x\u0303, \u1ef9, respectively.\nWe thus have\n\u1ef9\nx\u0303\n<\n\u21d0\u21d2\nx\u0303(\u22121)m\u22121 < \u1ef9(\u22121)m\u22121 .\n(17)\nx<y\n\u21d0\u21d2\nm\u22121\n(\u2212\u03b2)\n(\u2212\u03b2)m\u22121\n10\n\n\fSince xm = \u230a\u2212\u03b2 x\u0303 \u2212 l\u230b, ym = \u230a\u2212\u03b2 \u1ef9 \u2212 l\u230b, we have the following implications\nxm < ym\nxm > ym\n\n=\u21d2\n=\u21d2\n\n\u2212\u03b2 x\u0303 \u2212 l < \u2212\u03b2 \u1ef9 \u2212 l\n\u2212\u03b2 x\u0303 \u2212 l > \u2212\u03b2 \u1ef9 \u2212 l\n\n=\u21d2\n=\u21d2\n\nx\u0303 > \u1ef9 ,\nx\u0303 < \u1ef9 ,\n\nand thus\nx\u0303 > \u1ef9\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nxm < ym\n\n(18)\n\nIf m is odd, equivalences (17) and (18) imply x < y \u21d4 x\u0303 < \u1ef9 \u21d4 xm > ym \u21d4\nxm (\u22121)m < ym (\u22121)m .

An infinite string x1 x2 x3 * * * of integers is called (\u2212\u03b2, l)-admissible (or\njust admissible), if there exists an x \u2208 [l, r) such that x1 x2 x3 * * * is its (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion,\ni.e. x1 x2 x3 * * * = d(x).\nTheorem 13. Let d be the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion and denote d(l) = l1 l2 l3 * * * and d\u2217 (r) =\nr1 r2 r3 * * * . An infinite string x1 x2 x3 * * * of integers is (\u2212\u03b2, l)-admissible, if and only if\nl1 l2 l3 * * * \u0016alt xi xi+1 xi+2 * * * \u227aalt r1 r2 r3 * * * ,\n\nfor all i \u2265 1.\n\n(19)\n\nProof. The fact that the condition (19) is necessary follows as a consequence of Theorem 10. It remains to show that it is sufficient, i.e. that a digit string x1 x2 x3 * * *\nsatisfying the condition (19) is a (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion of an x \u2208 [l, r).

Reference strings d(l) and d\u2217 (r)\nLet us now study the digit strings which appear in the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-admissibility criteria.\nThe following theorem states the relation between d(l) and the limit d\u2217 (l) = lim d(l +\n\u03b5\u21920+\n\n\u03b5). Although d\u2217 (l) itself does not appear in the admissibility condition, it may, as we\nshall see on examples below, be used to derive the form of d\u2217 (r).\nTheorem 15. Let T be the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-transformation. If T q (l) 6= l for all q \u2208 N, or the\nequality T q (l) = l occurs only for even q \u2208 N, then\nd\u2217 (l) = d(l) .\nIf on the other hand T q (l) = l for some q \u2208 N, q odd, i.e. d(l) = (l1 l2 * * * lq\u22121 lq )\u03c9 , then\nd\u2217 (l) = l1 l2 * * * lq\u22121 (lq \u2212 1)d\u2217 (r) .\nProof. The proof uses the properties of the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-transformation stated in Section 4.\nRecall that the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-transformation is continuous on [l, r) except in the discontinuity\npoints forming the set D given by\npoints divide the interval\n\b\nS (14).

This together corresponds to the result of Ito and Sadahiro cited\nin the introduction.\nExample 17. Let l = \u2212 21 . As we have shown in (12), we have T (\u2212x) = \u2212T (x) for\nalmost all x \u2208 [l, r). It follows that\nd\u2217 (l) = d\u2217 (r) .\nIn case that d(l) is not purely periodic with odd period length, then\nd\u2217 (r) = d\u2217 (l) = d(l) .\nOn the other hand, if d(l) = (l1 * * * lq )\u03c9 is purely periodic with odd period length q, then\nusing Theorem 15 we obtain\nd\u2217 (r) = l1 * * * lq\u22121 (lq \u2212 1)d\u2217 (r) ,\nand by iteration\nd\u2217 (r) = l1 * * * lq\u22121 (lq \u2212 1)l1 * * * lq\u22121 (lq \u2212 1)d\u2217 (r) ,\nwhich implies\n\n\u0011\u03c9\n\u0010\nd (r) = l1 * * * lq\u22121 (lq \u2212 1)l1 * * * lq\u22121 (lq \u2212 1)\n\u2217\n\n\u0004\n\u0005\nExample 18. Let l = \u2212 \u03b21 . In that case l1 = \u2212 \u03b2(\u2212 \u03b21 ) + \u03b21 = 1 and T (l) =\n\u0001\n\u2212\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b21 \u2212 1 = 0. Consequently, the (\u2212\u03b2, \u2212 \u03b21 )-expansion of l is d(l) = 10\u03c9 for every\nbase \u2212\u03b2. Since it is not purely periodic, we have for the left limit that d\u2217 (l) = d(l). In\nthis case, the right limit d\u2217 (r) has no relation to d(l).\n15\n\n\fIn the remaining part of this section we focus on the question what sequences may\nplay role of the left and right reference strings in the admissibility condition. We\ndescribe some properties of these digit sequences, but, as we shall see, the question\nabout a necessary a sufficient condition is far from being solved even for the case of\nIto-Sadahiro numeration system. We explain the phenomenon on two examples which,\nin fact, represent an impeachment to Theorem 25 of G\u00f3ra [6] who approaches this\nproblem in a more general setting.\nWe start by a simple consequence of Theorem 13.\nCorollary 19. Let d be the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion. Every suffix of d(l) = l1 l2 l3 * * * satisfies\nthe admissibility condition (19), i.e.\nl1 l2 l3 * * * \u0016alt li li+1 li+2 * * * \u227aalt r1 r2 r3 * * * ,\n\nfor all i \u2265 1.\n\n(28)\n\nfor all i \u2265 1.\n\n(29)\n\nEvery suffix of d\u2217 (r) = lim d(r \u2212 \u03b5) = r1 r2 r3 * * * satisfies\n\u03b5\u21920+\n\nl1 l2 l3 * * * \u0016alt ri ri+1 ri+2 * * * \u0016alt r1 r2 r3 * * * ,\n\nProof. The admissibility condition for d(l) is an obvious consequence of Theorem 13.\nIn order to show the inequalities for d\u2217 (r), realize that every suffix ri ri+1 ri+2 * * * of\n\u2217\nd (r) is a limit of (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions of numbers T i\u22121 (r \u2212 \u03b5), as \u03b5 tends to 0 from the\nright. Since by Theorem 13 we have\n\u0001\nd T i\u22121 (r \u2212 \u03b5) \u227aalt d\u2217 (r) .\nApplying the limit, the strict inequality \u227aalt becomes \u0016alt .\n\nThe admissibility condition of Corollary 19 has interesting implications for repetition of blocks in prefixes of the reference digit strings d(l) and d\u2217 (r).\nCorollary 20. If w is a block of digits in the alphabet A of odd length such that ww\nis a prefix of d(l), then d(l) = w \u03c9 .\nIf w is a block of digits in the alphabet A of odd length such that ww is a prefix of\n\u2217\nd (r), then d\u2217 (r) = w \u03c9 .\nProof. Let us write\nd(l) = |ww{z\n* * * w} vs ,\n\n(30)\n\nk times\n\nwhere v is a string over A of the same length as w, k \u2265 2 and s is a suffix of d(l).\nAdmissibility condition in Corollary 19 implies\nww\n* * * w} vs \u0016alt wvs\n| {z\nk times\n\nNow we use the simple fact that the alternate order satisfies\nx \u0016alt y\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nwx \u0017alt wy\n\nfor a string w of odd length and any strings x, y. For our case this implies\nww\n* * * w} vs \u0017alt vs\n| {z\nk \u2212 1 times\n\n16\n\n\fand thus w0\u03c9 \u0017alt v0\u03c9 . On the other hand, w is the smallest among prefixes of the\nsame length of digit strings d(x) for all x \u2208 [l, r), and therefore w0\u03c9 \u0016alt v0\u03c9 . This\nimplies that w = v and we may deduce that d(l) has prefix w k+1. The procedure may\nbe repeated and hence d(l) = w \u03c9 .\nThe same argument is used for the right reference string d\u2217 (r).\nRemark 21. As a result, we can observe that whenever d(l) starts with aa for some\na\n. Similarly, prefix bb in\ndigit a, then necessarily d(l) = a\u03c9 and consequently l = \u2212 \u03b2+1\n\u2217\n\u03c9\nthe right reference string implies that d (r) = b .\nCorollary 19 above shows that the bounds used in the admissibility condition satisfy the condition by themselves, i.e. the admissibility conditions (28) and (29) are a\nnecessary condition so that strings l1 l2 l3 * * * and r1 r2 r3 * * * coincide with the reference\nstrings d(l) and d\u2217 (r) corresponding to some \u03b2 > 1 and l \u2208 (\u22121, 0]. This is analogous to the fact that in the case of positive base \u03b2 the R\u00e9nyi expansion of 1 satisfied\nthe Parry condition. Let us recall that for base \u03b2 > 1 one uses the transformation\nT (x) = \u03b2x \u2212 \u230a\u03b2x\u230b of the interval [0, 1). The string of integers d\u2217\u03b2 (1) = t1 t2 t3 * * * must\nsatisfy\n0\u03c9 \u0016lex ti ti+1 ti+2 * * * \u0016lex t1 t2 t3 * * * for every i = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\nParry [10] has shown that this condition is also sufficient, in order that a digit string\nt1 t2 t3 * * * is equal to d\u2217\u03b2 (1) for some \u03b2 > 1.\nA natural question arises, whether satisfying conditions\nl1 l2 l3 * * * \u0016alt li li+1 li+2 * * * \u227aalt r1 r2 r3 * * *\nl1 l2 l3 * * * \u0016alt ri ri+1 ri+2 * * * \u0016alt r1 r2 r3 * * *\n\nfor every i = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\n\n(31)\n\n\u221e\nfor a pair of integer sequences (li )\u221e\ni=1 , (ri )i=1 already ensures the existence of l and \u03b2,\nso that the sequences are equal to the left and right reference strings d(l) and d\u2217 (r)\ncorresponding to some \u03b2 > 1 and l \u2208 (\u22121, 0].\nSuch question was addressed by G\u00f3ra. In [6], he studies a more general number\nsystems. However, a special case of his is equivalent to representation with negative\nbase. Theorem 25 in [6] can be transformed into the statement that conditions (31)\n\u221e\nare sufficient for (li )\u221e\ni=1 , (ri )i=1 being the left and right reference strings for some \u03b2 and\nl. Here we show that his statement cannot be true.\nIn order to clarify the problem, let us focus on the Ito-Sadahiro numeration sys\u03b2\nand the sequences d(l) and d\u2217 (r) are connected as recalled in\ntem, where l = \u2212 \u03b2+1\nExample 16, i.e. when d(l) is non-periodic, then d\u2217 (r) = 0d(l).\n\u03c9\nExample 22. Consider the sequence (xi )\u221e\ni=1 = a(a \u2212 1)0a for some positive integer\na > 1. It is easily verified that every suffix xi xi+1 xx+2 * * * of this digit string satisfies\n\na(a \u2212 1)0a\u03c9 \u0016alt xi xi+1 xi+2 * * * \u227aalt 0a(a \u2212 1)0a\u03c9 .\n\n(32)\n\nNow if it holds that a(a \u2212 1)0a\u03c9 is the left reference string of the Ito-Sadahiro system,\nthen\na\na\u22121\na\na\n\u03b2\n=\n+\n+\n+\n+*** ,\n\u2212\n2\n4\n\u03b2+1\n\u2212\u03b2 (\u2212\u03b2)\n(\u2212\u03b2)\n(\u2212\u03b2)5\nwhich implies\u0002 that \u03b2 = a.\u0001 However, applying the Ito-Sadahiro transformation T with\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n1\na\nthe domain \u2212 \u03b2+1\n, \u03b2+1\nto the point \u2212 \u03b2+1\n= \u2212 a+1\nyields d(\u2212 \u03b2+1\n) = a\u03c9 . Thus,\na(a \u2212 1)0a\u03c9 is not an admissible left reference string, although it satisfies (32).\n17\n\n\fThe following example shows that such a case is not isolated and need not correspond to integer base \u2212\u03b2.\n\nExample 23. Consider in the Ito-Sadahiro system the digit string 200(21)\u03c9 . One\neasily verifies that every suffix xi xi+1 xi+2 * * * of 200(21)\u03c9 satisfies\n200(21)\u03c9 \u0016alt xi xi+1 xi+2 * * * \u227aalt 0200(21)\u03c9 .\nComparing\n\u03b2\n2\n2\n1\n2\n1\n=\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+*** ,\n4\n5\n6\n\u03b2+1\n\u2212\u03b2 (\u2212\u03b2)\n(\u2212\u03b2)\n(\u2212\u03b2)\n(\u2212\u03b2)7\n\u221a\nleads to \u03b2 = 21 (3 + 5). However, for such a base, the left reference string in the\nIto-Sadahiro number system is equal to (21)\u03c9 .\n\u2212\n\n7. Periodic (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions\n\u03b2\n)\nRepresentations of numbers in Ito-Sadahiro numeration system (the case l = \u2212 \u03b2+1\nfrom the point of view of dynamical systems have been studied by Frougny and Lai [4].\nThey have shown that if \u03b2 is a Pisot number, then d(x) is eventually periodic for any\n\u2212\u03b2\n1\nx \u2208 [ \u03b2+1\n, \u03b2+1\n) \u2229 Q(\u03b2). In particular, their result implies that for every Pisot number\nthe reference strings d(l), d\u2217 (r) in the admissibility condition are eventually periodic.\nBases \u03b2, for which in the Ito-Sadahiro numeration system the reference string d(l) is\neventually periodic have been called Ito-Sadahiro numbers and by [3] they are exactly\nthe bases for which the Ito-Sadahiro (\u2212\u03b2)-shift is sofic. The result of Frougny and Lai\nthus implies that Pisot numbers are Ito-Sadahiro numbers. This is an analogy to the\nstatement for positive bases, namely that all Pisot numbers are Parry numbers. Liao\nand Steiner [8] show that surprisingly the notion of Ito-Sadahiro numbers and Parry\nnumbers do not coincide.\nIn this section, we study the question of periodic (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansions. We show\nthat the statement on Ito-Sadahiro expansions can be simply extended to the case of\ngeneralized (\u2212\u03b2)-numeration defined on [l, r), with l \u2208 (\u22121, 0] and r = l + 1. Note that\nthe proof, just as the one in [4], is only a slight modification of the proof for positive\nbases given by Schmidt in [12].\n\nTheorem 24. If \u03b2 is a Pisot number and d is the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion for some l \u2208\n(\u22121, 0], then d(x) is eventually periodic for any x \u2208 [l, r) \u2229 Q(\u03b2).\nProof. Let \u03b22 , . . . , \u03b2d be the algebraic conjugates of \u03b2 = \u03b21 . Let x \u2208 [l, r) \u2229 Q(\u03b2) be\nfixed. Such a number obviously belongs to the set 1q (Z + \u03b2Z + * * * + \u03b2 d\u22121 Z) for some\ninteger q.

Also rn = rn is bounded, since\nrn = T n (x), and thus rn \u2208 [l, r), which implies |rn | < 1.\nConsider the lattice L in Rd spanned by vectors\n1\n(1, 1, . . . , 1) ,\nq\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . , \u03b2d ,\nq\n\n...,\n\nFrom (33), it is obvious that the d-tuples\n(2)\n\n(d\u22121)\n\nR1 = (r1 , r1 , . . . , r1\n\n),\n\n(2)\n\n(d\u22121)\n\nR2 = (r2 , r2 , . . . , r2\n\n\u0001\n1 d\u22121 d\u22121\n\u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . , \u03b2dd\u22121 .\nq\n),\n\n...,\n\nRn = (rn , rn(2) , . . . , rn(d\u22121) ),\n\nbelong to the lattice L for all n \u2208 N, and we have derived that they are found within a\nbounded region of Rd . There are only finitely many lattice points in a bounded region,\nand hence one finds vectors Rk , Rm for k < m that coincide. It follows that rm = rk\nand d(x) is eventually periodic.\nRemark 25. Note that the above theorem does not speak about periodicity of d(l) if\nl \u2208\n/ Q(\u03b2). In fact, if l \u2208\n/ Q(\u03b2), then the expansion d(l) = l1 l2 l3 * * * is necessarily\nnon-periodic, even if \u03b2 is a Pisot number.\nOn the other hand, the fact that d(l) is eventually periodic does not predicate about\nthe algebraic character of the base \u03b2. It only says that l \u2208 Q(\u03b2). However, assuming\nthat both reference strings appearing in the admissibility condition are eventually periodic already implies that \u03b2 is an algebraic integer. For, if d(l) and d\u2217 (r) are eventually\nperiodic, we can derive an expression for the number 1 = \u2022d\u2217 (r) \u2212 \u2022d(l) as a power series in (\u2212\u03b2)\u22121 whose integer coefficients are arranged in an eventually periodic order.\nSuch an expression gives rise to a monic polynomial with integer coefficients having \u03b2\nas a root.\nThe following theorem is an almost reverse to Theorem 24. Assuming eventually\nperiodic (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion of all rationals in the interval [l, r), we derive that \u03b2 must be\nPisot or Salem. Here we would like to point out that the original proof of Schmidt could\nnot be adapted so easily because of the phenomena of degenerated intervals mentioned\nin Section 6.\n\n19\n\n...\n\n\fTheorem 26. Let d be the (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion. If any rational x \u2208 [l, r) has eventually\nperiodic (\u2212\u03b2, l)-expansion, then \u03b2 is either Pisot or Salem number.\nProof. First realize that by assumption there exists a rational number from [l, r) of the\nform m1 , m \u2208 Z with eventually periodic expansion. It is easy to see that this gives us\na monic polynomial from Z[x] with \u03b2 as its root, hence \u03b2 is an algebraic integer. It\nremains to show that all conjugates of \u03b2 are in modulus smaller than or equal to 1.\nFrom Lemma 9 we derive that there exists a non-zero digit a such that for all N \u2208 N\nwe can find a rational number y satisfying\nd(y) = aN y1 y2 y3 * * * .\n\n(34)\n\nExpression (34) can be rewritten\ny=\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\na\nyi\u2212N\na\n1 \u2212 (\u2212\u03b2)\u2212N X\nyi\n+***+\n+\n=\na\n+\nN\ni\n(\u2212\u03b2)\n(\u2212\u03b2)\n(\u2212\u03b2)\n\u03b2+1\n(\u2212\u03b2)i+N\ni=1\ni=N +1\n\nand so\na\n1\ny=\n+\n\u03b2 + 1 (\u2212\u03b2)N\n\n\u221e\n\nX yi\n\u2212a\n+\n\u03b2 + 1 i=1 (\u2212\u03b2)i\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(35)\n\nAs y \u2208 Q, by assumption,P\nthe infinite word y1 y2 y3 * * * is eventually periodic and by\nyi\nsumming a geometric series, \u221e\ni=1 (\u2212\u03b2)i can be rewritten as\n\u221e\nX\ni=1\n\nyi\n= c0 + c1 \u03b2 + * * * + cd\u22121 \u03b2 d\u22121 \u2208 Q(\u03b2) ,\n(\u2212\u03b2)i\n\nwhere d is the degree of the algebraic integer \u03b2.

By\napplication of the isomorphism between Q(\u03b2) and Q(\u03b3), we get\nc0 + c1 \u03b3 + * * * + cd\u22121 \u03b3 d\u22121 =\n\n\u221e\nX\ni=1\n\nyi\n,\n(\u2212\u03b3)i\n\nand thus from (35) we get\na\n1\ny=\n+\n\u03b3 + 1 (\u2212\u03b3)N\n\n\u221e\n\nX yi\n\u2212a\n+\n\u03b3 + 1 i=1 (\u2212\u03b3)i\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nNow denote \u03b7 = max{|\u03b2|\u22121, |\u03b3|\u22121} < 1 and realize that \u2308\u03b2\u2309 estimates the greatest\ndigit in modulus. Comparing (35) and (36), we obtain\n!\n\u221e\nX\na\na\na\na\n(37)\n\u2264 \u03b7N\n+ 2\u2308\u03b2\u2309\n\u03b7i .\n\u2212\n\u2212\n0<\n\u03b2+1 \u03b3+1\n\u03b2+1 \u03b3+1\ni=1\nObviously, the value in the bracket on the right hand side of (37) is a finite constant\nindependent on N, and thus the right hand side tends to zero with N increasing to\ninfinity. This leads to contradiction, since on the left hand side of (37) we have a fixed\npositive number.\n\n20\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge financial support by the Czech Science Foundation grant 201/09/0584\nand by the grants MSM6840770039 and LC06002 of the Ministry of Education, Youth,\nand Sports of the Czech Republic.
