We consider the interference pattern for the medium\u2013induced gluon\nradiation produced by a color singlet quark\u2013antiquark antenna embedded in a QCD\nmedium with size L and 'jet quenching' parameter q\u0302. Within the\np BDMPS\u2013Z regime,\nwe demonstrate that, for a dipole opening angle \u03b8qq\u0304 \u001d \u03b8c \u2261 2/ q\u0302L3 , the interference\nbetween the medium\u2013induced gluon emissions by the quark and the antiquark is\nsuppressed with respect to the direct emissions.

For \u03b8qq\u0304 \u001c \u03b8c , the medium\u2013induced radiation vanishes.\n\n1. Introduction\nOne of the most spectacular observations of the LHC heavy ion program is the strong\nmodification of jets in a dense QCD medium [1, 2]. Most theoretical descriptions of\nthis modification have focussed on the characterization of the medium\u2013induced gluon\nradiation off a single parton propagating through the plasma (see [3] for a review).\nHowever, due to both jet evolution and in\u2013medium radiation, a jet involves several\npartons which can radiate simultaneously. It is then necessary to address whether\nthe medium\u2013induced emissions by several sources in such a multi\u2013partonic system can\ninterfere with each other. In vacuum, interference effects are present, frustrating large\nangle emissions and leading to the angular ordering of vacuum showers. The survival of\nangular ordering for medium\u2013induced radiation has only recently been discussed [4, 5].\nTo address this problem, we will describe the medium\u2013induced gluon radiation\nfrom a q q\u0304 dipole created in the medium. If the dipole angle is sufficiently large, the\nradiation produced by the q and the q\u0304 has no overlap with each other and thus they are\nindependent. If the dipole opening angle is not that large, and in view of the experience\nwith radiation in the vacuum, one may expect the dipole antenna pattern to be affected\nby interference effects. However, in the medium this expectation is generally incorrect.\n\n\fInterference Phenomena in Medium Induced Radiation\n\n2\n\nA detailed proof of the of the statement above can be found in [4] and relies on\nthe following properties of the medium\u2013induced radiation q\nby a single source: (i) The\nformation of a medium\u2013induced gluon takes a time \u03c4f = 2\u03c9/q\u0302. When the gluon is\n1/4\n\nformed it is emitted at a typical angle \u03b8f = (2q\u0302/\u03c9 3 )\nfrom the parent quark and\nit carries a typical transverse momentum kf ' \u03c9\u03b8f . (ii) After formation, multiple\nscattering leads to additional broadening of the gluon spectrum. The final gluon\n\u221a\ndistribution is concentrated within a typical angle \u03b8s = q\u0302L/\u03c9 > \u03b8f around the parent\nparton. (iii) As long as \u03c4f \u001c L, gluons are emitted all along the medium and the\nmedium\u2013induced gluon spectrum is proportional to \u03c4f L (the longitudinal phase\u2013space).\n2. Coherence phenomena and interference time scales\nThe interference phenomena require the two partonic sources to be coherent with each\nother during the gluon formation. In turn, this requirement has two aspects:\n(i) Quantum coherence. The emission process preserves the quantum coherence\nof the q q\u0304 system so long as the virtual gluon overlaps with both sources during formation.\nFor that to be possible, the transverse resolution of the gluon at the time of formation,\nas measured by the respective transverse wavelength \u03bbf = 1/kf , should be larger than\nthe typical distance between the q and the q\u0304. In the vacuum, this condition leads\nto angular ordering but for medium\u2013induced emissions the situation is more subtle:\nduring formation, the transverse size of the q q\u0304 system increases from rmin ' \u03b8qq\u0304 t1 to\nrmax ' \u03b8qq\u0304 t2 ; here, t1 and t2 = t1 + \u03c4f are the times when the emission is initiated\nand completed respectively. Since the gluon undergoes transverse diffusion during its\nformation, the relevant size is the geometric average of these\ntwo scales and the condition\nq\n\u221a\nof quantum coherence amounts to rmin rmax < \u03bbf , or t1 (t1 + \u03c4f ) < \u03bbf /\u03b8qq\u0304 \u2261 \u03c4\u03bb with\n\u03c4\u03bb the transverse resolution time. It is easy to see that\n1\n\u03b8f\n\u03c4\u03bb =\n= \u03c4f\n,\n(1)\n1/4\n\u03b8qq\u0304 (q\u0302\u03c9)\n\u03b8qq\u0304\nwhere the second estimate follows from kf ' \u03c9\u03b8f and \u03c4f ' 2/(\u03c9\u03b8f2 ). This estimate leads\nto two limiting regimes, depending upon the ratio \u03b8qq\u0304 /\u03b8f :\n(i.a) For relatively small dipole angles \u03b8qq\u0304 \u001c \u03b8f , one has \u03c4\u03bb \u001d \u03c4f and the definition\nof \u03c4\u03bb implies t1 < \u03c4\u03bb . Since in this regime the BDMPS\u2013Z spectra produced by the two\nemitters are confined to angles < \u03b8f around their respective sources during the formation\nprocess, these two spectra overlap but can only interfere over a time \u03c4\u03bb .\n(i.b) For larger dipole angles \u03b8qq\u0304 \u001d \u03b8f , one has \u03c4\u03bb \u001c \u03c4f and therefore t1 \u001c \u03c4f as\nwell. The definition of \u03c4\u03bb leads to t1 < \u03c4\u03bb2 /\u03c4f \u2261 \u03c4int which introduces a new scale \u03c4int ,\nthe interference time. This scale can be rewritten as\n!2\n\n\u03b8f\n2\n\u03c4int =\n= \u03c4f\n,\n(2)\n2\n\u03c9\u03b8qq\u0304\n\u03b8qq\u0304\nwhere the first expression is recognized as the vacuum\u2013like formation time for a gluon\nemitted at an angle \u223c \u03b8qq\u0304 . This is so since, in this regime, interference can only occur\nfor gluons radiated at this large angle.\n\n\fInterference Phenomena in Medium Induced Radiation\n\n\u0398f\n\u0398qq\n\n3\n\nL+\n\n\u0398s\n\nq\n\nx+\n\np\n\nk\n\ny+\n\n\u03c4f\n\ngg\n0\n\nqq\n\nqg\n\nk\nq\n\nL\n\np\n\nFigure 1.

While the final radiation spectra from each source overlap (blue cone),\nthey are separated at formation (red cone). Right: Feynman graph for interference.\nThe amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude are drawn on top of each other.\n\n(ii) Color coherence. In addition to quantum coherence, the existence of\ninterference effects require the preservation of the color coherence between the quark\nand the antiquark. In the vacuum, the color state of the dipole is conserved until a\ngluon emission takes place and the interference pattern is governed solely by quantum\ncoherence. In the medium, on the contrary, the interactions with the medium\nconstituents change the color of each of the propagating partons via 'color rotation'.\nFor a very energetic parton, this rotation amounts to multiplying the respective\nwavefunction by a a Wilson line. For the q q\u0304 pair we have two such Wilson lines which\ndiverge from each other at constant angle \u03b8qq\u0304 . The color coherence is measured by the\n2\u2013point correlation function of these Wilson lines, as obtained after averaging over the\nfluctuations of the background field. Within the 'multiple soft scattering approximation',\nthis 2\u2013point function can be computed and it shows that the quark and the antiquark\nloose any trace of their original color state after the decoherence time\n\u03c4coh =\n\n2\n(q\u0302\u03b8q2q\u0304 )1/3\n\n= \u03c4f\n\n\u03b8f\n\u03b8qq\u0304\n\n!2/3\n\n=\n\n\u03b8c\n\u03b8qq\u0304\n\n!2/3\n\nL.\n\n(3)\n\n3. Classification of dipole sizes.\nWhile the details of the in\u2013medium dipole antenna pattern depend upon all the scales\nidentified above, the phase\u2013space for interference is controlled by the smallest of them,\n\u03c4min = min(\u03c4\u03bb , \u03c4int , \u03c4coh ). As a consequence, the interference contribution to the gluon\nspectrum, does not scale with the medium length, as the emission from each of the\nsources does, but with \u03c4min . We can distinguish the following regimes [4]\n\n\fInterference Phenomena in Medium Induced Radiation\n\n4\n\n1. Very large dipole angles, \u03b8qq\u0304 > \u03b8s . In this case the medium-induced\nspectra from each source do not overlap and the q and the q\u0304 radiate independently.\n2. Relatively large dipole angles, \u03b8f < \u03b8qq\u0304 < \u03b8s . In this regime Eqs. 1, 2\nand 3 imply the hierarchy of scales \u03c4int < \u03c4\u03bb < \u03c4coh < \u03c4f . Accordingly, in this regime,\nthe longitudinal phase\u2013space for interferences is of order \u223c \u03c4int \u03c4f and it is suppressed\nwith respect to the corresponding phase\u2013space \u223c \u03c4f L for direct emissions by a factor\ns\n\n!2\n\n\u03c9 \u03b8f\n\u03c4int\nR=\n\u223c\n\u001c 1.\n(4)\nL\n\u03c9c \u03b8qq\u0304\n3. Relatively small dipole angles \u03b8c \u001c \u03b8qq\u0304 \u001c \u03b8f . In this case, the\nlimitation on the phase\u2013space for interference is due to color coherence, since the\nordering of time scales is reverted: \u03c4f \u001c \u03c4coh \u001c \u03c4\u03bb \u001c \u03c4int . The longitudinal phase\u2013\nspace for interference is now of order \u03c4coh \u03c4f and it is suppressed as compared to the\nphase\u2013space for direct emissions. Hence the interference contribution is suppressed by\n!2/3\n\n\u03b8c\n\u03c4coh\n=\n\u001c 1.\n(5)\nR =\nL\n\u03b8qq\u0304\nNote that, in this case, the medium\u2013induced radiation is distributed at large angles\n\u03b8q ' \u03b8q\u0304 > \u03b8f \u001d \u03b8qq\u0304 , well outside the dipole cone, and one may wonder why the total\nradiation is not zero. The reason is that, so long as \u03b8qq\u0304 \u001d \u03b8c , a q q\u0304 pair immersed in the\nmedium is not a 'color singlet' anymore, except for a very brief period of time \u223c \u03c4coh .\n4. Very small dipoles angles \u03b8qq\u0304 < \u03b8c . For these small angles, the color\ncoherence time \u03c4coh becomes as large as the medium size L, as clear from Eq. 3, and the\nq q\u0304 pair preserves its color and quantum coherence throughout the medium. Interference\neffects are not suppressed and they act towards reducing the medium\u2013induced radiation\nby the dipole. For sufficiently small angles \u03b8qq\u0304 \u001c \u03b8c , the color decoherence is\nparametrically small and the total in\u2013medium radiation becomes negligible.\nIn summary, we have argued that for dipole angles \u03b8qq\u0304 \u001d \u03b8c , the interference\neffects for the medium\u2013induced radiation are negligible, so the total BDMPS\u2013Z spectrum\nby the dipole is the incoherent sum of the spectra produced by the q and the q\u0304. For\nsmaller angles \u03b8qq\u0304 < \u03b8c , the interference effects are not suppressed and they cancel\nthe direct emissions when \u03b8qq\u0304 \u001c \u03b8c . We observe that for the representative values for\nq\u0302 = 10 GeV2 /fm and L = 10 fm, \u03b8c \u223c 0.01 is very small, and most of the dipoles\nof phenomenological interest will radiate as two independent partonic sources. This\nsimplifies the way towards Monte\u2013Carlo studies of the in\u2013medium jet evolution.\nReferences\n[1] Roland C 2011 Jet measurements by the CMS experiment in pp and PbPb collisions (these\nproceedings).\n[2] Cole C 2011 ATLAS jet measurements (these proceedings).\n[3] Casalderrey-Solana J and Salgado C A 2007 Acta Phys.
