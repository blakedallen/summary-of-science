The predicted scalar spectral index ns cannot be smaller than 0.97 and can exceed unity including corrections from minimal supergravity, if the number of e-foldings corresponding\nto the pivot scale k\u2217 = 0.002/Mpc is around 50. These results are marginally consistent with the fitting of the three-year Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data by\nthe standard power-law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological\nconstant. However, ns can be reduced by applying two mechanisms: (i) The utilization\nof a quasi-canonical K\u00e4hler potential with a convenient choice of a sign and (ii) the\nrestriction of the number of e-foldings that k\u2217 suffered during FHI. In the case (i), we\ninvestigate the possible reduction of ns without generating maxima and minima of the\npotential on the inflationary path. In the case (ii), the additional e-foldings required for\nsolving the horizon and flatness problems can be generated by a subsequent stage of\nfast-roll [slow-roll] modular inflation realized by a string modulus which does [does\nnot] acquire effective mass before the onset of modular inflation.\n\n\fC. Pallis\n\n2\n\n1\n\nI NTRODUCTION\n\nA plethora of precise cosmological observations on the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) and the large-scale structure in the universe has strongly favored the idea\nof inflation [1] (for reviews see e.g. Refs. [2, 3, 4]). We focus on a set of well-motivated,\npopular and quite natural models [5] of supersymmetric (SUSY) F-term hybrid inflation\n(FHI) [6], realized [7] at (or very close to) the SUSY grand unified theory (GUT) scale\nMGUT = 2.86 \u00d7 1016 GeV. Namely, we consider the standard [7], shifted [8] and smooth\n[9] FHI. In the context of global SUSY (and under the assumption that the problems of the\nstandard big bag cosmology (SBB) are resolved exclusively by FHI), these models predict\nscalar spectral index, ns , extremely close to unity and without much running, as . Moreover,\ncorrections induced by minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) drive [10] ns closer to unity or\neven upper than it.\nThese predictions are marginally consistent with the fitting of the three-year Wilkinson\nmicrowave anisotropy probe (WMAP3) results by the standard power-law cosmological\nmodel with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant (\u039bCDM). Indeed, one obtains\n[11] that, at the pivot scale k\u2217 = 0.002/Mpc, ns is to satisfy the following rather narrow\nrange of values:\nns = 0.958 \u00b1 0.016 \u21d2 0.926 . ns . 0.99\n(1)\nat 95% confidence level with negligible as .\nA possible resolution of the tension between FHI and the data is suggested in Ref. [12].\nThere, it is argued that values of ns between 0.98 and 1 can be made to be compatible with\nthe data by taking into account a sub-dominant contribution to the curvature perturbation\nin the universe due to cosmic strings which may be (but are not necessarily [13]) formed\nduring the phase transition at the end of FHI. However, in such a case, the GUT scale is\nconstrained to values well below MGUT [14, 15, 16]. In the following, we reconsider two\nother resolutions of the problem above without the existence of cosmic strings:\n(i) FHI within quasi-canonical SUGRA (qSUGRA). In this scenario, we invoke [16,\n17] a departure from mSUGRA, utilizing a quasi-canonical (we use the term coined\noriginally in Ref. [18]) K\u00e4hler potential with a convenient arrangement of the sign\nof the next-to-minimal term. This yields a negative mass term for the inflaton in the\ninflationary potential which can lead to acceptable ns 's. In a sizable portion of the\nregion in Eq. (1) a local minimum and maximum appear in the inflationary trajectory,\nthereby jeopardizing the attainment of FHI. In that case, we are obliged to assume\nsuitable initial conditions, so that hilltop inflation [19] takes place as the inflaton rolls\nfrom the maximum down to smaller values. Therefore, ns can become consistent\nwith Eq. (1) but only at the cost of a mild tuning [16] of the initial conditions. On the\nother hand, we can show [20, 21] that acceptable ns 's can be obtained even without\nthis minimum-maximum problem.\n(ii) FHI followed by modular inflation (MI). It is recently proposed [22] that a two-step\ninflationary set-up can allow acceptable ns 's in the context of FHI models even with\n\n\fReducing the Spectral Index in F-Term Hybrid Inflation\n\n3\n\ncanonical K\u00e4hler potential. The idea is to constrain the number of e-foldings that k\u2217\nsuffers during FHI to relatively small values, which reduces ns to acceptable values.\nThe additional number of e-foldings required for solving the horizon and flatness\nproblems of SBB can be obtained by a second stage of inflation (named [22] complementary inflation) implemented at a lower scale. We can show that MI [23] (for\nanother possibility see Ref. [24]), realized by a string modulus, can play successfully\nthe role of complementary inflation. A key issue of this set-up is the evolution of\nthe modulus before the onset of MI [25, 26]. We single out two cases according to\nwhether or not the modulus acquires effective mass before the commencement of MI.\nWe show that, in the first case, MI is of the slow-roll type and a very mild tuning of\nthe initial value of the modulus is needed in order to obtain solution compatible with\na number of constraints. In the second case, the initial value of the modulus can\nbe predicted due to its evolution before MI, and MI turns out to be of the fast-roll\n[27] type. However, in our minimal set-up, an upper bound on the total number of\ne-foldings obtained during FHI emerges, which signalizes a new disturbing tuning.\nPossible ways out of this situation are also proposed.\nIn this presentation we reexamine the above ideas for the reduction of ns within FHI,\nimplementing the following improvements:\n\u2022 In the case (i) we delineate the parametric space of the FHI models with acceptable\nns 's maintaining the monotonicity of the inflationary potential and derive analytical\nexpressions which approach fairly our numerical results.\n\u2022 In the case (ii) we incorporate the nucleosynthesis (NS) constraint and we analyze\nthe situation in which the inflaton of MI acquires mass before the onset of MI, under\nsome simplified assumptions [28].\nThe text is organized as follows: In Sec. 2, we review the basic FHI models and in the\nfollowing we present the two methods for the reduction of ns using qSUGRA (Sec. 3) or\nconstructing a two-step inflationary scenario (Sec. 4). Our conclusions are summarized in\nSec. 5.\n\n2\n\nT HE FHI M ODELS\n\nWe outline the salient features (the superpotential in Sec 2.1, the SUSY potential in Sec. 2.2\nand the inflationary potential in Sec. 2.3) of the basic types of FHI and we present their\npredictions in Sec. 2.6, calculating a number of observable quantities introduced in Sec. 2.4,\nwithin the standard cosmological set-up described in Sec. 2.5.\n\n\fC.

(2) for standard FHI is the most general renormalizable superpotential consistent with a continuous R-symmetry [7] under which\nS \u2192 ei\u03b1 S, \u03a6\u0304\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6\u0304\u03a6, W \u2192 ei\u03b1 W.\n\n(3)\n\nIncluding in this superpotential the leading non-renormalizable term, one obtains the superpotential of shifted [8] FHI in Eq. (2). Finally, the superpotential of smooth [9] FHI can be\nproduced if we impose an extra Z2 symmetry under which \u03a6 \u2192 \u2212\u03a6 and, therefore, only\neven powers of the combination \u03a6\u0304\u03a6 can be allowed.\n\n2.2\n\nT HE SUSY P OTENTIAL\n\nThe SUSY potential, VSUSY , extracted (see e.g. ref. [2]) from W in Eq. (2) includes F and\nD-term contributions. Namely,\nVSUSY = VF + VD , where\n\u2022 The F-term contribution can be written as:\n\uf8f1 2 4\n\u0001\n\uf8f2 \u03ba M (\u03a62 \u2212 1)2 + 2S2 \u03a62\n\u0001\nVF = \u03ba2 M 4 (\u03a62 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03be\u03a64 )2 \u0001+ 2S2 \u03a62 (1 \u2212 2\u03be\u03a62 )2\n\uf8f3 4\n\u03bcS (1 \u2212 \u03a64 )2 + 16S2 \u03a66\n\nfor standard FHI,\nfor shifted FHI,\nfor smooth FHI,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the scalar components of the superfields are denoted by the same symbols as\nthe corresponding superfields and\n\u001a\n\u03a6 = |\u03a6|/M\u221a and S = |S|/M\nfor standard or shifted FHI,\n\u221a\n\u03a6 = |\u03a6|/2 \u03bcS MS and S = |S|/ 2\u03bcS MS for smooth FHI,\n\n\fReducing the Spectral Index in F-Term Hybrid Inflation\n\n5\n\nwith \u03be = M 2 /\u03baMS and 1/7.2 < \u03be < 1/4 [8].\nIn Figs. 1, 2 and 3 we present the three dimensional plot of VF versus \u00b1\u03a6 and S for\nstandard, shifted and smooth FHI, respectively. The inflationary trajectories are also\ndepicted by bold points, whereas the critical points by red/light points.\n\u2022 The D-term contribution VD vanishes for |\u03a6\u0304| = |\u03a6|.\nUsing the derived VSUSY , we can understand that W in Eq. (2) plays a twofold crucial\nrole:\n\u2022 It leads to the spontaneous breaking of G. Indeed, the vanishing of VF gives the v.e.vs\nof the fields in the SUSY vacuum. Namely,\n\nhSi = 0 and |h\u03a6\u0304i| = |h\u03a6i| = vG =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 M\u221a\nM\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\u221a\n\n\u221a\n1\u2212 1\u22124\u03be\n\u221a\n2\u03be\n\n\u03bcS MS\n\nfor standard FHI,\nfor shifted FHI,\nfor smooth FHI\n\n(5)\n\n(in the case where \u03a6\u0304, \u03a6 are not Standard Model (SM) singlets, h\u03a6\u0304i, h\u03a6i stand for the\nv.e.vs of their SM singlet directions). The non-zero value of the v.e.v vG signalizes\nthe spontaneous breaking of G.\n\u2022 It gives also rise to FHI. This is due to the fact that, for large enough values of |S|,\nthere exist valleys of local minima of the classical potential with constant (or almost\nconstant in the case of smooth FHI) values of VF . In particular, we can observe that\nVF = cst along the following F-flat direction(s):\n\u03a6=0\np\n\u03a6 = 0 Or \u03a6 = 1/2\u03be\n\u221a\n\u03a6 = 0 Or \u03a6 = 1/2 6S\n\nfor standard FHI,\nfor shifted FHI,\nfor smooth FHI.\n\nFrom Figs. 1-3 we deduce that the flat direction \u03a6 = 0 corresponds to a minimum of\nVF , for |S| \u226b M , in the cases of standard and shifted FHI and to a maximum of VF in the\ncase of smooth FHI. Since FHI can be attained along a minimum of VF we infer that, during\nstandard FHI, the GUT gauge group G is necessarily restored. As a consequence, topological defects such as strings [14, 15, 16], monopoles, or domain walls may be produced [9]\nvia the Kibble mechanism [30] during the spontaneous breaking of G at the end of FHI.\nThis can be avoided in the other two cases, since the form of VF allows for non-trivial inflationary valleys along which G is spontaneously broken (since the waterfall fields \u03a6\u0304 and \u03a6\ncan acquire non-zero values during FHI).

In the cases of standard [7] and shifted\n[8] FHI, this slope can be generated by the SUSY breaking on this valley. Indeed,\nVHI0 > 0 breaks SUSY and gives rise to logarithmic radiative corrections to the\npotential originating from a mass splitting in the \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u0304 supermultiplets. On the\nother hand, in the case of smooth [9] FHI, the inflationary valleys are not classically\nflat and, thus, there is no need\u221aof radiative corrections. Introducing the canonically\nnormalized inflaton field \u03c3 = 2|S|, VHIc can be written as follows:\n\n\fC.

Also N is the dimensionality of the representations\nto which \u03a6\u0304 and \u03a6 belong and Q is a renormalization scale. Although, in some parts\n(see Sec. 4.3) of our work, rather large \u03ba's are used for standard and shifted FHI,\nrenormalization group effects [31] remain negligible.\nIn our numerical applications in Secs. 2.6, 3.3, and 4.3 we take N = 2 for standard FHI. This corresponds to the left-right symmetric GUT gauge group SU (3)c \u00d7\nSU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R \u00d7 U (1)B\u2212L with \u03a6\u0304 and \u03a6 belonging to SU (2)R doublets with\nB \u2212 L = \u22121 and 1 respectively. It is known [13] that no cosmic strings are produced\nduring this realization of standard FHI. As a consequence, we are not obliged to impose extra restrictions on the parameters (as e.g. in Refs. [15, 14]). Let us mention,\nin passing, that, in the case of shifted [8] FHI, the GUT gauge group is the Pati-Salam\ngroup SU (4)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R . Needless to say that the case of smooth FHI\nis independent on the adopted GUT since the inclination of the inflationary path is\ngenerated at the classical level and the addition of any radiative correction is expected\nto be subdominant.\n\u2022 VHIS is the SUGRA correction to VHI . This emerges if we substitute a specific choice\nfor the K\u00e4hler potential K into the SUGRA scalar potential which (without the Dterms) is given by\nK/m2P\n\nVSUGRA = e\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2217\n\n(Fi ) K\n\ni\u2217 j\n\n\u0015\n|W |2\nFj \u2212 3 2 ,\nmP\n\n(9)\n\n\fReducing the Spectral Index in F-Term Hybrid Inflation\n\n9\n\nwhere Fi = Wi + Ki W/m2P , a subscript i [i\u2217 ] denotes derivation with respect to\n\u2217\n(w.r.t) the complex scalar field \u03c6i [\u03c6i \u2217 ] and K i j is the inverse of the matrix Kji\u2217 .\nThe most elegant, restrictive and highly predictive version of FHI can be obtained,\nassuming minimal K\u00e4hler potential [6, 10], Km = |S|2 . In such a case VHIS becomes\nVHISm = VHI0\n\n\u03c34\n,\n8m4P\n\n(10)\n\nwhere mP \u2243 2.44 \u00d7 1018 GeV is the reduced Planck scale. We can observe that in\nthis case, no other free parameter is added to the initial set of the free parameters of\neach model (see Sec. 2.6).\n\u2022 VHIT is the most important contribution to VHI from the soft SUSY effects [14, 16, 32]\nwhich can be uniformly parameterized as follows:\np\n\u221a\nVHIT = aS VHI0 \u03c3/ 2\n(11)\nwhere aS is of the order of 1 TeV. VHIT starts [14, 16, 32] playing an important role\nin the case of standard FHI for \u03ba . 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 and does not have [32], in general, any\nsignificant effect in the cases of shifted and smooth FHI.\n\n2.4\n\nI NFLATIONARY O BSERVABLES\n\nUnder the assumption that (i) possible deviation from mSUGRA is suppressed (see Sec. 3.2)\nand (ii) the cosmological scales leave the horizon during FHI and are not reprocessed during\na possible subsequent inflationary stage (see Sec. 4), we can apply the standard (see e.g.\nRefs. [2, 3, 4]) calculations for the inflationary observables of FHI. Namely, we can find:\n\u2022 The number of e-foldings NHI\u2217 that the scale k\u2217 suffers during FHI,\nZ \u03c3\u2217\n1\nVHI\nNHI\u2217 = 2\nd\u03c3 \u2032 ,\nVHI\nmP \u03c3f\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the prime denotes derivation w.r.t \u03c3, \u03c3\u2217 is the value of \u03c3 when the scale k\u2217\ncrosses outside the horizon of FHI, and \u03c3f is the value of \u03c3 at the end of FHI, which\ncan be found, in the slow roll approximation, from the condition\n\u0012 \u2032 \u00132\nV \u2032\u2032\nm2P VHI\nand \u03b7 \u2243 m2P HI *\nmax{\u01eb(\u03c3f ), |\u03b7(\u03c3f )|} = 1, where \u01eb \u2243\n(13)\n2\nVHI\nVHI\nIn the cases of standard [7] and shifted [8] FHI and in the parameter space where\nthe terms in Eq.

(24)] (the opposite choice implies [18] a pronounced increase\nof ns above unity). As a consequence VHI acquires a rather interesting structure which is\nstudied in Sec. 3.1. In Sec. 3.2 we specify the observational constraints which we impose\nto this scenario and in Sec. 3.3 we exhibit our numerical results.\n\n3.1\n\nT HE S TRUCTURE\n\nOF THE I NFLATIONARY\n\nP OTENTIAL\n\nIn the qSUGRA scenario the potential VHI can be derived from Eq. (6) posing VHIS = VHISq\ngiven by Eq. (24) with minus in the first term. Depending on the value of cq , VHI is a\nmonotonic function of \u03c3 or develops a local minimum and maximum. The latter case leads\nto two possible complications: (i) The system gets trapped near the minimum of VHI and,\nconsequently, no FHI takes place and (ii) even if FHI of the so-called hilltop type [19] occurs\nwith \u03c3 rolling from the region of the maximum down to smaller values, a mild tuning of the\ninitial conditions is required [16] in order to obtain acceptable ns 's.\nIt is, therefore, crucial to check if we can accomplish the aim above, avoiding [20, 21]\nthe minimum-maximum structure of VHI . In such a case the system can start its slow rolling\nfrom any point on the inflationary path without the danger of getting trapped. This can be\n\u2032 > 0\nachieved, if we require that VHI is a monotonically increasing function of \u03c3, i.e. VHI\nfor any \u03c3 or, equivalently,\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\nVHI\n(\u03c3\u0304min ) > 0 with VHI\n(\u03c3\u0304min ) = 0 and VHI\n(\u03c3\u0304min ) > 0\n\n(25)\n\n\u2032 lies.

(19) and (20). However, due to the presence of the extra parameter cq , a\nsimultaneous fulfillment of Eq. (1) becomes [17, 16, 20] possible. In addition, we take into\naccount, as optional constraint, Eq. (25) so as complications from the appearance of the\nminimum-maximum structure of VHI are avoided.\nIt is worth mentioning that Kq in Eq. (23) generates a non-minimal kinetic term of \u03c3\nthereby altering, in principle, the inflationary dynamics and the calculation of the inflationary observables. Indeed, the kinetic term of \u03c3 is\n\u2202 2 Kq\n\u03c32\n1 \u2202 2 Kq 2\n\u03c3\u0307\nwith\n=\n1\n\u00b1\n2c\nq\n2 \u2202S\u2202S \u2217\n\u2202S\u2202S \u2217\nm2P\n\n(30)\n\n(the dot denotes derivation w.r.t the cosmic time). Assuming that the 'friction' term 3H \u03c3\u0307\ndominates over the other terms in the equation of motion (e.o.m) of \u03c3, we can derive the\nslow roll parameters \u01eb and \u03b7 in Eq. (13) which carry an extra factor (1 \u00b1 2cq \u03c3 2 /m2P )\u22121 , in\nthe present case. The formulas in Eqs. (12) and (14) get modified also. In particular, a factor\n(1 \u00b1 2cq \u03c3 2 /m2P ) must be included in the integrand in the right-hand side (r.h.s) of Eq. (12)\nand a factor (1 \u00b1 2cq \u03c3 2 /m2P )1/2 in the r.h.s of Eq. (14). However, these modifications are\ncertainly numerically negligible since \u03c3 \u226a mP and cq \u226a 1 (see Sec. 3.3).\n\n\fReducing the Spectral Index in F-Term Hybrid Inflation\n\n3.3\n\n17\n\nN UMERICAL R ESULTS\n\nS HIFTED FHI\nns\n0.926 0.958\ncq /10\u22123\n16.8\n7.5\n\u22123\nmax\ncq /10\n1.7\n1.87\n16\n\u03c3\u2217 /10 GeV 6.05\n5.46\n\u03ba/10\u22123\n7.8\n8.45\nM/1016 GeV 2.18\n2.24\n1/\u03be\n4.1\n4.21\nNHI\u2217\n51.7\n52\n\u2212\u03b1s /10\u22124\n2.8\n3.4\n\n0.976\n2\n2\n5.36\n9\n2.28\n4.31\n52\n3.5\n\nS MOOTH FHI\nns\n0.926\ncq /10\u22123\n11\n\u22123\nmax\ncq /10\n9\n16\n\u03c3\u2217 /10 GeV\n23.1\nMS /5 \u00d7 1017 GeV 2.86\n\u03bcS /1016 GeV\n0.06\n16\n\u03c3f /10 GeV\n13.4\nNHI\u2217\n52.2\n\u22123\n\u2212\u03b1s /10\n0.56\n\n0.958\n8.3\n9\n24.5\n2.02\n0.08\n13.4\n52.4\n0.8\n\n0.99\n5.45\n9\n26.5\n1.44\n0.1\n13.4\n52.6\n1\n\nTABLE 3: Input and output parameters consistent with Eqs.

In addition to the parameters manipulated there, here we have the parameter\ncq which can be adjusted so as to achieve ns in the range of Eq. (1). We check also the\nfulfillment of Eq. (25).\nIn the case of standard FHI with N = 2, we delineate the (lightly gray shaded) region\nallowed by Eqs. (1), (19) and (20) in the \u03ba \u2212 cq (Fig. 7) and \u03ba \u2212 vG (Fig. 8) plane. The\nconventions adopted for the various lines are also shown in the r.h.s of each graphs. In\nparticular, the black solid [dashed] lines correspond to ns = 0.99 [ns = 0.926], whereas\nthe gray solid lines have been obtained by fixing ns = 0.958 \u2013 see Eq. (1). The dot-dashed\nlines correspond to cq = cmax\nin Eq. (27) whereas the dotted line indicates the region in\nq\nwhich Eq. (1) is fulfilled in the mSUGRA scenario. In the hatched region, Eq. (25) is also\nsatisfied. We observe that the optimistic constraint of Eq. (25) can be met in a narrow but\nnot unnaturaly small fraction of the allowed area. Namely, for ns = 0.958, we find\n0.06 . \u03ba . 0.15 with 0.47 & vG /(1016 GeV) & 0.37 and 0.013 . cq . 0.03.\nThe lowest ns = 0.946 can be achieved for \u03ba = 0.15. Note that the vG 's encountered here\nare lower that those found in the mSUGRA scenario (see Sec. 2.6).\nIn the cases of shifted and smooth FHI we confine ourselves to the values of the parameters which give vG = MGUT and display in Table 3 their values which are also consistent\nwith Eqs. (19) and (20) for selected ns 's. In the case of shifted FHI, we observe that (i) it\nis not possible to obtain ns = 0.99 since the mSUGRA result is lower (see Table 2) (ii) the\nlowest possible ns compatible with the conditions of Eq. (25) is 0.976 and so, ns = 0.958\nis not consistent with Eq. (25). In the case of smooth FHI, we see that reduction of ns consistently with Eq.

This proposition [22] is based on the observation\nthat ns within FHI models generally decreases [31] with NHI\u2217 \u2013 given by Eq. (12). This\nstatement is induced by Eqs. (17) and (18) and can be confirmed by Fig. 9 where we draw\nns in standard FHI with N = 1 as a function of NHI\u2217 for several \u03ba's indicated in the graph.\nOn the curves, Eq. (19) is satisfied. Therefore, we could constrain NHI\u2217 , fulfilling Eq. (1).\nNote that a constrained NHI\u2217 was also previously used in Ref. [34] to achieve a sufficient\nrunning of ns .\nThe residual amount of e-foldings, required for the resolution of the horizon and flatness problems of the standard big-bang cosmology, can be generated during a subsequent\nstage of MI realized at a lower scale by a string modulus. We show that this scenario can\nsatisfy a number of constraints with more or less natural values of the parameters. Such\na construction is also beneficial for MI, since the perturbations of the inflaton field in this\nmodel are not sufficiently large to account for the observations, due to the low inflationary\nenergy scale.\nLet us also mention that MI naturally assures a low reheat temperature. As a consequence, the gravitino constraint [29] on the reheat temperature of FHI and the potential\ntopological defect problem of standard FHI [30] can be significantly relaxed or completely\nevaded. On the other hand, for the same reason baryogenesis is made more difficult, since\nany preexisting baryon asymmetry is diluted by the entropy production during the modulus\ndecay. However, it is not impossible to achieve adequate baryogenesis in the scheme of\ncold electroweak baryogenesis [35] or in the context of (large) extra dimensions [36].\nThe main features of MI are sketched in Sec. 4.1.

(35). Namely,\nNMI =\n\nsMf\n1\nmP\n1\nln\n\u2243\nln\n*\nFs sMi\nFs sMi\n\n(41)\n\nIn our computation we take for the\u221avalue of s at the end of MI sMf = mP , since the\ncondition \u01ebs = 1 gives sMf /mP = 2/Fs > 1, for the ranges of Eq. (36). This result is\nfound because the (unspecified) terms in the ellipsis in the r.h.s of Eq. (32) starts playing an\nimportant role for s \u223c mP and it is obviously unacceptable.\nIn Fig. 11, we depict NMI versus ms /Hs for sMf = mP and several sMi /mP 's indicated\nin the graph. We observe that NMI is very sensitive to the variations of ms /Hs . Also, taking\ninto account that 20 . NMI . 30 (limited in Fig. 11 by two thin lines) is needed so that\n\n\fReducing the Spectral Index in F-Term Hybrid Inflation\n\n23\n\nMI plays successfully the role of complementary inflation (see Sec. 4.3), we can deduce the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 As sMi decreases, the required ms /Hs for obtaining NMI \u223c 30 increases. To this\nend, for sMi /mP . 10\u22128 [sMi /mP & 10\u22128 ], we need fast-roll [slow-roll] MI.\n\u2022 For sMi /mP & 0.1, it is not possible to obtain NMI \u223c 30 and so, MI can not play\nsuccessfully the role of complementary inflation.\n\n4.2\n\nO BSERVATIONAL C ONSTRAINTS\n\nIn addition to Eqs. (1) and (19) \u2013 on the assumption that the inflaton perturbation generates exclusively the curvature perturbation \u2013 the cosmological scenario under consideration\nneeds to satisfy a number of other constraints too. These can be outlined as follows:\n(i) The horizon and flatness problems of SBB can be successfully resolved provided that\nthe scale k\u2217 suffered a certain total number of e-foldings Ntot . In the present set-up, Ntot\nconsists of two contributions:\nNtot = NHI\u2217 + NMI .\n\n(42)\n\nEmploying the conventions and the strategy we applied in the derivation of Eq.

The various eras of the cosmological evolution are also shown.\n\nThe cosmological evolution followed in the derivation of Eq. (43) is illustrated in Fig. 12\nwhere we design the (dimensionless) physical length \u03bb\u0304\u2217 = \u03bb\u2217 /R0 (dashed line) corresponding to k\u2217 and the (dimensionless) particle horizon R\u0304H = 1/H\u0304 = H0 /H (solid line)\n1/4\nas a function of \u03c4\u03b9 = ln R/R0 . In this plot we take VHI0 = 1015 GeV, NHI\u2217 \u2243 15,\n1/4\nVMI0 = 5 \u00d7 1010 GeV, NMI \u2243 30, and TMrh = 1 GeV. We take also R\u0304H = H0 /Hs for\nMI. The various eras of the cosmological evolution are also clearly shown (compare with\nFig. 4).\n(ii) Taking into account that the range of the cosmological scales which can be probed\nby the CMB anisotropy is [2] 10\u22124 /Mpc \u2264 k \u2264 0.1/Mpc (length scales of the order\nof 10 Mpc are starting to feel nonlinear effects and it is, thus, difficult to constrain [39]\nprimordial density fluctuations on smaller scales) we have to assure that all the cosmological\nscales:\n\u2022 Leave the horizon during FHI. This entails:\nNHI\u2217 & Nk (k = 0.002/Mpc) \u2212 Nk (k = 0.1/Mpc) = 3.9\n\n(45)\n\nwhich is the number of e-foldings elapsed between the horizon crossing of the pivot\nscale k\u2217 and the scale 0.1/Mpc during FHI.\n\n\fReducing the Spectral Index in F-Term Hybrid Inflation\n\n25\n\n\u2022 Do not re-enter the horizon before the onset of MI (this would be possible since\nthe scale factor increases during the inter-inflationary MD era [38]). This requires\nNHI\u2217 & NHIc , where NHIc is the number of e-foldings elapsed between the horizon\ncrossing of a wavelength kc (which corresponds to the dimensionless length scale\n\u03bb\u0304c = \u03bbc /R0 depicted by a dotted line in Fig. 12) and the end of FHI.

Since, within the cosmological models with running spectral index, |\u03b1s |'s of order 0.01 are encountered [11], we impose the\nfollowing upper bound on |\u03b1s |:\n|\u03b1s | \u226a 0.01 .\n(48)\n(iv)\n\nUsing the bounds of Eq. (36), we can find the corresponding bounds on NMI . Namely,\n0.73 ln\n\nmP\nmP\n\u2264 NMI \u2264 10.2 ln\n*\nsMi\nsMi\n\n(49)\n\nmin \u223c 3\nThe relevant for our analysis (see Sec. 4.3) is the lower bound on NMI which is NMI\nmin \u223c 25 for s\nfor sMi /mP = 0.01 or NMI\nMi \u223c Hs and ms = m3/2 = 1 TeV.\n\n(v) Restrictions on the parameters can be also imposed from the evolution of the field s\nbefore MI. Depending whether s acquires or not effective mass [25, 26] during FHI and the\ninter-inflationary era, we can distinguish the cases:\n\u2022 If s does not acquire mass (e.g. if s represents the axionic component of a string\nmodulus or if a specific form for the K\u00e4hler potential of s has been adopted), we\nassume that FHI lasts long enough so that the value of s is completely randomized\n[40] as a consequence of its quantum fluctuations from FHI. We further require that\nall the values of s belong to the randomization region, which dictates [40] that\n2\n4\nwhere HHI0\n= VHI0 /3m2P .\nVMI0 \u2264 HHI0\n\n(50)\n\n\fC. Pallis\n\n26\n\nUnder these circumstances, all the initial values sMi of s from zero to mP are equally\nprobable \u2013 e.g. the probability to obtain sMi /mP \u2264 0.01 is 1/100. Furthermore, the\nfield s remains practically frozen during the inter-inflationary period since the Hubble\nparameter is larger than its mass.\n\u2022 If s acquires effective mass of the order of HHI0 (as is [25, 26] generally expected)\nvia the SUGRA scalar potential in Eq. (9), the field s can decrease to small values\nuntil the onset of MI. In our analysis we assume that:\n\u2013 The inflaton S has minimal K\u00e4hler potential Km \u221a\n= |S|2 and therefore, induces\n[25] an effective mass to s during FHI, ms |HI = 3HHI0 .\n\n\u2013 The modulus s is decoupled from the visible sector superfields both in K\u00e4hler\npotential and superpotential and has canonical K\u00e4hler potential, Ks = s2 /2.\nIn such a simplified case, the value smin at which the SUGRA potential has a\nminimum is [28] smin = 0.\n\nFollowing Refs. [34, 41], the evolution of s can be found by solving its e.o.m. More\nexplicitly, inserting into Eq. (34),\n2 , we can derive the\n\u2013 H = HHI0 and V = (ms |HI )2 s2 /2 with (ms |HI )2 = 3HHI0\nvalue of s at the end of FHI:\n!\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3\n3\n\u22123NHI /2\n(51)\nNHI + sin\nNHI ,\ncos\nsHf = sHi e\n2\n2\n\nwhere sHi \u223c mP is the value of s at the onset of FHI and NHI is the total number\nof e-foldings obtained during FHI. We have also imposed the initial conditions,\ns(N = 0) = sHi and ds(N = 0)/dN = 0.\n\u2013 H = HHI0 e\u22123N\u0304 /2 with N\u0304 = ln(R/RHf ) and V = (ms |MD )2 s2 /2 with\n(ms |MD )2 = 3H 2 /2, we can derive the value of s at the beginig of MI:\n!\nr\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n15 VHI0\n3\n15 VHI0\nVMI0 1/4\nln\nsin\nln\ncos\n+\n, (52)\nsMi = sHf\nVHI0\n12\nVMI0\n5\n12\nVMI0\nwhere we have taken into account that during the inter-inflationary MD epoch\nR \u221d \u03c1\u22121/3 and imposed the initial conditions, s(N\u0304 = 0) = sHf and ds(N\u0304 =\n0)/dN\u0304 = 0.\nIn conclusion, combining Eqs.

Therefore, we have to dictate\nsMi \u226b \u03b4s|HMI and sMi \u226b \u03b4s|MI \u2243 Hs /2\u03c0.\n\n(54)\n\nIn order to estimate \u03b4s|HMI , we find it convenient to single out the cases:\n\u2022 If s does not acquire mass before MI, \u03b4s|HMI remains frozen during FHI and the\ninter-inflationary era. Consequently, we get\n\u03b4s|HMI \u2243 HHI0 /2\u03c0.\n\n(55)\n\nObviously the first inequality in Eq. (54) is much more restrictive than the second one\nsince HHI0 \u223c 1010 GeV whereas Hs \u223c ms .\n\u2022 If s acquires mass before MI, we find [34, 41]:\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nHHI0 HHI0 1/2 \u22123NHIc /2 VMI0 1/4\nHs\n\u03b4s|HMI \u2243\ne\n= 1/4 ,\n2\u03c0\nms |HI\nVHI0\n3 2\u03c0\n\n(56)\n\nwhere Eq. (46) has been applied. As a consequence, the second inequality in Eq. (54)\nis roughly more restrictive than the first one and leads via Eq. (53) to the restriction:\n2 (VHI0 VMI0 )1/4\nmax\nmax\n\u221a\nNHI \u2264 NHI\nwith NHI\n= \u2212 ln\n*\n3\n2 3\u03c0m2P\n1/4\n\n(57)\n\n1/4\n\nmax \u223c (15 \u2212 18).\nGiven that VHI0 \u223c 1014 GeV and VMI0 \u223c 1010 GeV, we expect NHI\nThis result signalizes an ugly tuning since it would be more reasonable FHI has a\nlong duration due to the flatness of VHI . This tuning could be evaded in a more\nelaborated set-up which would assure that smin 6= 0, due to the fact that s would not\nbe completely decoupled \u2013 as in Refs. [34, 41].\n\n(vii) If s decays exclusively through gravitational couplings, its decay width \u0393s and, consequently, TMrh are highly suppressed [42, 43]. In particular,\n\u0012\n\u00131/4\np\n72\n1 m3s\nand\n[45]\nT\n=\n\u0393s mP /\u03c0\n(58)\n\u0393s =\nMrh\n8\u03c0 m2P\n5g\u03c1\u2217 (TMrh )\n\nwith g\u03c1\u2217 (TMrh ) \u2243 76. For ms \u223c 1 TeV, we obtain TMrh \u2243 10 keV which spoils the\nsuccess of NS within SBB, since RD era must have already begun before NS takes place\nat TNS \u2243 1 MeV. This is [42] the well known moduli problem. The easiest (although\nsomehow tuned) resolution to this problem is [42, 43] the imposition of the condition (for\nalternative proposals see Refs. [28, 43]):\nms \u2265 100 TeV which ensures TMrh \u2265 TNS .\n\n(59)\n\nTo avoid the so-called [44] moduli-induced gravitino problem too, m3/2 is to increase accordingly.\n\n\fC. Pallis\n\n28\n\n4.3\n\nN UMERICAL R ESULTS\n\nIn addition to the parameters mentioned in Sec. 2.6, our numerical analysis depends on the\nparameters:\nm3/2 , ms , ms /Hs , sMi .\nWe take throughout m3/2 = ms = 100 TeV which results to TMrh = 1.5 MeV through\nEq. (58) and assures the satisfaction of the NS constraint with almost the lowest possible\nms . Since TMrh appears in Eq. (44) through its logarithm, its variation has a minor influence on the value of Ntot and, therefore, on our results. On the contrary, the hierarchy\nbetween m3/2 and ms plays an important role, because NMI depends crucially only on Fs\n\u2013 see Eq. (35) \u2013 which in turn depends on the ratio ms /Hs with Hs \u223c m3/2 . As justified\nin the point (vii) we consider the choice ms \u223c m3/2 as the most natural. It is worth mentioning, finally, that the chosen value of ms (and m3/2 ) has a key impact on the allowed\nparameter space of this scenario, when s does not acquire mass before MI. This is, because\nms is explicitly related to VMI0 \u2013 see Eq. (33) \u2013 which, in turn, is involved in Eq. (50) and\nconstrains strongly HHI0 \u2013 see point (i) below.\nAs in Sec. 2.6, we use as input parameters \u03ba (for standard and shifted FHI with fixed\nMS = 5 \u00d7 1017 GeV) or MS (for smooth FHI) and \u03c3\u2217 . Employing Eqs. (15) and (19),\nwe can extract ns and vG respectively. For every chosen \u03ba or MS , we then restrict \u03c3\u2217 so\nas to achieve ns in the range of Eq. (1) and take the output values of NHI\u2217 (contrary to our\nstrategy in Sec. 2.6 in which NHI\u2217 given by Eq. (20) is treated as a constraint and ns is an\noutput parameter). Finally, for every given sMi , we find from Eq. (44) the required NMI and\nthe corresponding vs or ms /Hs from Eq. (41). Replacing Fs from Eqs. (35) in Eq. (41) and\nsolving w.r.t ms /Hs , we find:\ns\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nmP\nmP\n1\nms\n=\nln\nln\n+3\n(60)\nHs\nNMI sMi NMI sMi\nAs regards the value of sMi we distinguish, once again, the cases:\n(i) If s remains massless before MI, we choose sMi /mP = 0.01. This value is close\nenough to mP to have a non-negligible probability to be achieved by the randomization of s\nduring FHI (see point (v) in Sec. 4.2). At the same time, it is adequately smaller than mP to\nguarantee good accuracy of Eqs. (35) and (41) near the interesting solutions and justify the\nfact that we neglect the uncertainty from the terms in the ellipsis in Eq. (32) \u2013 since we can\nobtain NMI \u223c 30 with low ms /Hs 's which assures low \u01ebs 's as we emphasize in Eq. (38).\nMoreover, larger sMi 's lead to smaller parameter space for interesting solutions (with ns\nnear its central value).\nOur results are presented in Figs. 13 \u2013 16 for standard FHI (with N = 2) and in Table 4\nfor shifted and smooth FHI.

This is due to the fact that we take here a much\nlarger ms in order to fulfill Eq. (59) \u2013 not considered in Ref. [22].\n\u2013 The requirement of Eq. (47) does not constrain the parameters since it is overshadowed by the constraint of Eq. (50).\n\u2013 In almost the half of the available parameter space for ns \u223c 0.958 we have\nrelatively high |\u03b1s |, 0.005 . |\u03b1s | . 0.01.\n\n\u2013 For ns = 0.958, we obtain 0.04 . \u03ba . 0.14, 0.89 . vG /(1016 GeV) . 1.08\nand 0.003 . |\u03b1s | . 0.01. Also, 12 . NHI\u2217 . 21.7, 35 & NMI & 28 and\n0.64 . ms /Hs . 0.74. So, the interesting solutions correspond to slow rather\nthan fast-roll MI.\n\n\u2022 Shifted FHI. We list input and output parameters consistent with Eqs. (19), (44), (47)\n\u2013 (50), (54) and (59) for the nearest to MGUT vG and selected ns 's in Table 4. The\nvalues of vG come out considerably larger than in the case of standard FHI. However,\nthe satisfaction of Eq. (50) in conjunction with Eq. (59) leads to vG > MGUT . Indeed,\nvG = MGUT occurs for low \u03ba's which produce VHI0 's inconsistent with Eq. (50) \u2013\ncompare with Ref. [22].\n\u2022 Smooth FHI. We arrange input and output parameters consistent with Eqs. (19), (44),\n(47) \u2013 (50), (54) and (59) for vG = MGUT and selected ns 's in Table 4. In contrast\nwith standard and shifted FHI, we can achieve vG = MGUT for every ns in the range\nof Eq. (1). The mSUGRA corrections in Eq. (10) play an important role for every\nMS encountered in Table 4 and |\u03b1s | is considerably enhanced but compatible with\nEq. (48).\n(ii) If s acquires mass, sMi can be evaluated from Eq. (53). However, due to our ignorance of NHI , there is an uncertainty in the determination of ms /Hs , i.e. for every NMI\nrequired by Eq. (44), we can derive a maximal [minimal], ms /Hs |max [ms /Hs |min ], value\n\n\fC.

Our\nresults are presented in Figs. 17 \u2013 20 for standard FHI (with N = 2) and in Table 5 for\nshifted and smooth FHI. Let us discuss each case separately:\n\u2022 Standard FHI. We present the regions allowed by Eqs. (1), (19), (44) and (47) \u2013 (49),\n(57) and (59) in the \u03ba \u2212 vG (Fig. 17), \u03ba \u2212 ms /Hs (Fig. 18), \u03ba \u2212 NHI\u2217 (Fig. 19), and\n\u03ba \u2212 NMI (Fig. 20) plane. The conventions adopted for the various lines are displayed\nin the r.h.s of every graph. In particular, the black solid [dashed] lines correspond to\nns = 0.99 [ns = 0.926] whereas the gray solid lines have been obtained by fixing\nns = 0.958 \u2013 see Eq. (1). The dot-dashed [double dot-dashed] lines correspond to the\nlower [upper] bound on NHI\u2217 from Eq. (47) [Eq. (57)]. The double dot-dashed lines\ncorrespond to the upper [lower] bound on ms /Hs [NMI ] from Eq. (36) [Eq. (49)].\nThe bold [faint] dotted lines correspond to \u03b1s = \u22120.01 [\u03b1s = \u22120.005]. Let us notice\nthat:\n\u2013 Lower than those seen in Fig. 13 (but still larger than those shown in Figs. 5\nand 8) vG 's and \u03ba's are allowed in Fig. 17, since the constraint of Eq. (50) is not\napplied here. As \u03ba increases above 0.01 the mSUGRA corrections in Eq. (10)\nbecome more and more significant.\n\u2013 The constraint from the upper bound on NHI in Eq. (57) is very restrictive and\nalmost overshadows this from the lower bound on NMI in Eq. (49) (which is\napplied, e.g., only in the upper left corner of the allowed region in Fig. 18).\n\u2013 In contrast with the case (i), 0.005 . |\u03b1s | . 0.01 holds only in a very limited\npart of the allowed regions.\n\n\fReducing the Spectral Index in F-Term Hybrid Inflation\n\n33\n\nns=0.99\nns=0.926\nms/Hs=2.45\n\n1.1\n\n16\n\nvG (10 GeV)\n\n1.0\n\nNHI*=NHI\n\n0.9\n\nmin\nmax\n\nNHI*=NHI\n\u03b1s=-0.01\n\u03b1s=-0.005\nns=0.958\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n\u03ba\nF IGURE 17: Allowed (lightly gray shaded) region in the \u03ba \u2212 vG plane for standard FHI followed by MI\nrealized by a field which acquires effective mass before MI.

The results are quite similar to those for shifted FHI except for the fact that\nwe have vG > MGUT for ns = 0.958 and 0.99 and that |\u03b1s | remains considerably\nenhanced.\n\n\fC. Pallis\n\n36\n\n5\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nWe reviewed the basic types (standard, shifted and smooth) of FHI in which the GUT breaking v.e.v, vG , turns out to be comparable to SUSY GUT scale, MGUT . Indeed, confronting\nthese models with the restrictions on PR\u2217 we obtain that vG turns out a little lower than\nMGUT for standard FHI whereas vG = MGUT is possible for shifted and smooth FHI.\nHowever, the predicted ns is just marginally consistent with the fitting of the WMAP3 data\nby the standard power-law \u039bCDM cosmological model \u2013 if the horizon and flatness problems of SBB are resolved exclusively by FHI.\nWe showed that the results on ns can be reconciled with data if we consider one of the\nfollowing scenaria:\n(i) FHI within qSUGRA. In this case, acceptable ns 's can be obtained by appropriately\nrestricting the parameter cq involved in the quasi-canonical K\u00e4hler potential, with a convenient sign. We paid special attention to the monotonicity of the inflationary potential\nwhich is crucial for the safe realization of FHI. Enforcing the monotonicity constraint, reduction of ns below around 0.95 is prevented. Fixing in addition ns to its central value, we\nfound that (i) relatively large \u03ba's but rather low vG 's are required within standard FHI with\n0.013 . cq . 0.03 and (ii) vG = MGUT is possible within smooth FHI with cq \u2243 0.0083\nbut not within shifted FHI.\n(ii) FHI followed by MI. In this case, acceptable ns 's can be obtained by appropriately\nrestricting the number of e-foldings NHI\u2217 . A residual number of e-foldings is produced by\na bout of MI realized at an intermediate scale by a string modulus. We have taken into\naccount extra restrictions on the parameters originating from:\n\u2022 The resolution of the horizon and flatness problems of SBB.\n\u2022 The requirements that FHI lasts long enough to generate the observed primordial\nfluctuations on all the cosmological scales and that these scales are not reprocessed\nby the subsequent MI.\n\u2022 The limit on the running of ns .\n\u2022 The naturalness of MI.\n\u2022 The homogeneity of the present universe.\n\u2022 The complete randomization of the modulus if this remains massless before MI or its\nevolution before MI if it acquires effective mass.\n\u2022 The establishment of RD before the onset of NS.\nWe discriminated two basic versions of this scenario, depending whether the modulus\ndoes or does not acquire effective mass before MI. We concluded that:\n\n\fReducing the Spectral Index in F-Term Hybrid Inflation\n\n37\n\n\u2022 If the modulus remains massless before MI, the combination of the randomization\nand NS constraints pushes the values of the inflationary plateau to relatively large\nvalues. Fixing ns to its central value, we got (i) vG < MGUT and 10 . NHI\u2217 . 21.7\nwithin the standard FHI, (ii) vG > MGUT and NHI\u2217 \u2243 21 within shifted FHI and (iii)\nvG = MGUT and NHI\u2217 \u2243 18 within smooth FHI. In all cases, MI of the slow-roll\ntype, with ms /Hs \u223c (0.6\u2212 0.8), and a mild (of the order of 0.01) tuning of the initial\nvalue of the modulus produces the necessary additional number of e-foldings.\n\u2022 If the modulus acquires effective mass before MI, lower values, than those encountered in the case (i), of the inflationary plateau are available. Fixing ns to its central\nvalue, we got (i) vG < MGUT and 8.5 . NHI\u2217 . 17.5 within the standard FHI\nand (ii) vG < MGUT [vG > MGUT ] and NHI\u2217 \u2243 17 within shifted [smooth] FHI.\nIn all cases, MI of the fast-roll type with ms /Hs \u223c (1.4 \u2212 2.45) and without any\ntuning of the initial value of the modulus produces the necessary additional number\nof e-foldings. However, FHI is constrained to be of short duration, producing a total\nnumber of e-foldings, NHI . 17. This is rather questionable and can be evaded by\nintroducing a more elaborated structure for the K\u00e4hler potential or superpotential of\nthe modulus (see, e.g., Ref. [34, 41]).\nTrying to compare the proposed methods for the reduction of ns within FHI, we can do\nthe following comments:\n\u2022 The main advantage of the method in the case (i) is that the standard one-step inflationary cosmological set-up remains intact. This method becomes rather attractive\nwhen the minimum-maximum structure of the inflationary potential is avoided. However, the possible in this way decrease of ns is rather limited.\n\u2022 The method of the case (ii) offers a comfortable reduction of ns but it requires a more\ncomplicate cosmological set-up with advantages (dilution of gravitinos and defects)\nand disadvantages (complications with baryogenesis). The most natural and simple\nversion of this scenario is realized when the modulus remains massless during FHI\nsince it requires a very mild tuning.\nHopefully, the proposed scenaria will be further probed by the measurements of the\nPlanck satellite which is expected to give results on ns with an accuracy \u2206ns \u2243 0.01 by the\nend of the decade [46].\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank G.
