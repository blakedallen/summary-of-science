When\na unification group, e.g., SO(10), E6 or others, broke down to the group of Standard Model,\nquarks and leptons find their own bases, though they were once in a common flavor basis.\nIn the light of the philosophy of unification, it is natural that the separated quark sector and\nlepton sector do appear with common properties in mass and mixing. Apparently, however,\nthe low energy phenomenology does not provide a clue of a common basis shared by them.\nThe Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa(CKM) matrix of quark mixing, to be denoted by UQ , and\nthe Potecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-maskawa(PMNS) matrix of lepton mixing, to be denoted by\nUL , can be expressed commonly in standard parametrization;\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2212i\u03b4\n\nc12 c13\ns12 c13\ns13 e\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u2212s12 c23 \u2212 c12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4 c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4 s23 c13\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\ns12 s23 \u2212 c12 c23 s13 ei\u03b4 \u2212c12 s23 \u2212 s12 c23 s13 ei\u03b4 c23 c13\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(1)\n\nwhere sij and cij denote sin \u03b8ij and cos \u03b8ij , respectively, of a mixing angle \u03b8ij between i-th\nand j-th generations. The global fit of CKM matrix in the Standard Model implies the bestQ\nQ\nfit values, sQ\n12 = 0.2276, s23 = 0.04148, s13 = 0.00359, and \u03b4 = 1.20 rad, while the best-fit\n\nvalues of lepton mixing angles are sL12 = 0.551, sL23 = 0.707, and sL13 = 0.1[1][2]. Quarks and\nleptons do barely share common properties from the low-energy phenomenological point of\nview.\nUpon incomplete understanding of neutrino masses, reliable data is only the mass squared\ndifference, so that the best-fit values of them, \u2206m221 = 7.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 , |\u2206m231 | = 2.4 \u00d7\n10\u22123 eV2 , are the usable numbers allowed now[2]. Such partial information currently hold\nthe wide possibility for a change in PMNS matrix at high energy scale, since the masses\ncan be either quasi-degenerate or hierarchical. It is known that the quasi-degenerate type of\nmass spectrum helps Renormalization Group Equations(RGE) drive the running of mixing\nangles making a rapid ascent or descent, although hierarchical masses make the running of\nangles slow, or even unchanging [3][4][5][6]. That is, RG evolution of mixing angles based on\nthe current data has ruled out neither the form of PMNS in high energy scale exactly equal\nto CKM nor the form of PMNS completely different from the CKM. Any type of connection\nbetween those extreme cases, of course, has not been excluded.\n2\n\n\fQuark Lepton Unification(QLU) implies that quarks and leptons have the common flavor\nbasis and the common mass basis so that CKM and PMNS have the same elements [7][8][9].\nHere is introduction to the simplest extension to QLU that might be brought from the basis\nshift occurred during the seesaw mechanism or extra symmetry breaking process: The PMNS\nis a similar transformation of CKM, which is possible when the unitary transformation from\nold flavor basis to new flavor basis is equal to the one from old mass basis to new mass basis.\nThe condition will be called Quark Lepton Similarity(QLS). The special case in which the\nunitary matrix for the similar transformation is an identity matrix corresponds to QLU. The\nprediction from the similarity condition narrows down the ranges in a number of physical\nparameters such as \u2206m231 , sin \u03b813 sin \u03b4, and tan \u03b2. This paper is organized as follows. Sec.II\ndescribes the way to express the similarity condition of CKM and PMNS in terms of lepton\nmixing angles, and Sec.III deals with the results of RGE of lepton mixing angles and their\ncomparison with the angles drawn up from the similarity. In conclusion, the prediction from\nQLS will be summarized.\n\nII.\n\nQUARK LEPTON SIMILARITY\n\nIf mixing matrices are built on flavor basis and mass basis within a GUT symmetry that\nstrongly unifies quarks and leptons, it is naturally proposed that there is one mixing matrix\nat the GUT scale MG [7][9];\n| mQ,L i = UG | Q, L i,\n\n(2)\n\nor | mQ i = UG | Q i and | mL i = UG | L i. However it is also possible to have separated\nbases after the GUT symmetry breaking, either quarks or leptons, to be transformed from\nthe original common basis to a new one. Seesaw mechanism or extra symmetry breaking\nmight be a process to bring such basis shift. So, if the lepton basis is the one under change,\nthe mixing matrix UL is defined for a new flavor basis and a new mass basis such that\n| m\u2032L i = UL | L\u2032 i. As long as the total transition probability is conserved, there exists a\nunitary transformation between | L i and | L\u2032 i and another between | mL i and | m\u2032L i,\ndenoting them by P and P \u2032 , respectively. Our assumption P = P \u2032 gives rise to a connection\nbetween the original mixing matrix UG and the lepton mixing matrix UL , such as UG =\nP \u22121 UL P . When UQ = UG or even when UQ undergoes another basis shift as UL did, one\n3\n\n\fcan obtain UQ = P \u22121 UL P . Then it is formally said that the two matrices UQ and UL are\nsimilar, or unitarily equivalent for P \u22121 = P \u2020 .\nSimilar matrices have the same characteristic polynomials,\np(\u03bb) = det U \u2212 c2 \u03bb + tr U\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 ,\n\n(3)\n\nfor an eigenvalue \u03bb of matrix U. Since both UQ and UL are unitary, their equal determinants\nare trivial; det UQ = det UL = 1. The principal minor c2 of the matrix in Eq.(3) is the trace of\ne . An element U\neij is given by the determinant of the 2\u00d72 matrix with row\nthe minor matrix U\ni and column j removed in U. The comparison of c2 's of two matrices and the comparison\nof their traces will fulfill the matching of the characteristic polynomials. Hereafter we use\nf defined with similar matrices UQ and UL ;\nvanishing functions W and W\nW (\u03b812 , \u03b823 , \u03b813 , \u03b4) = tr UQ \u2212 tr UL ,\n\n(4)\n\nf(\u03b812 , \u03b823 , \u03b813 , \u03b4) = tr U\neQ \u2212 tr U\neL , with lepton mixing angles and phase in UL ;\nwhile W\n\u03b812 , \u03b823 , \u03b813 and \u03b4. According to Eq.(1), the trace of UL is\n\ntr UL = c12 c13 + c23 c13 + c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4 ,\n\n(5)\n\neL = c12 c13 + c23 c13 + c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s23 s13 e\u2212i\u03b4 . Separating real parts and imaginary\nwhereas tr U\nf = 0 is equivalent to W = 0, which is sufficient to show the similarity between UQ\nparts, W\n\nand UL .\n\nThe similarity between CKM and PMNS could be considered at the Seesaw Mechanism\nscale MR , which might be GUT scale MG or somewhere several order of magnitude below\nMG . It has been checked that the elements of the CKM matrix do not vary over scales by\nrenormalization group equations due to strong mass hierarchy. The trace of UQ obtained\nwith the best-fit values of angles, i.e., tr UQ , is 2.947 \u2212 i(3.13 \u00d7 10\u22125 ). Then, the real part\nof W in Eq.(4) reduces to\nWr = 2.95 \u2212 c12 c13 \u2212 c23 c13 \u2212 c12 c23 + s12 s23 s13 cos \u03b4,\n3.13 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\u03b4 = arcsin(\n),\ns12 s23 s13\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the expression \u03b4 is obtained from the imaginary parts of the traces. The condition\ndoes not require the specification of \u03b4. The similarity condition W = 0 is adopted to find\nthe lepton mixing angles \u03b812 , \u03b823 , and \u03b813 at MR scale. Fig.1 shows loci of the possible pairs\nof \u03b812 , \u03b823 that satisfy the similarity for some fixed values of \u03b813 .\n4\n\n\fFIG. 1: W (\u03b812 , \u03b823 ) = 0.\nIII.\n\nRENORMALIZATION GROUP EQUATIONS FOR NEUTRINO MIXING\n\nANGLES\n\nThe renormalization group equations (RGE) of mixing angles are well summarized in\nRefs.[4][7] so that they can be rearranged such as\n\u1e6123 = \u2212H\u03c4 c223 (\u2212s12 U\u03c4 1 A31 + c12 U\u03c4 2 A32 ),\n\n(7)\n\n\u1e6113 = \u2212H\u03c4 c23 c213 (c12 U\u03c4 1 A31 + s12 U\u03c4 2 A32 ),\n\n(8)\n\n\u1e6112 = \u2212H\u03c4 c12 (c23 c213 s12 U\u03c4 1 A31\n\u2212c23 s13 c12 U\u03c4 2 A32 + U\u03c4 1 U\u03c4 2 A21 ),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere U\u03b1i is an element of the matrix in Eq.(1) and Aij = (mi +mj )/(mi \u2212mj ). According to\nRef.[9], since\n\nd\u03b4\ndt\n\nfor zero Majorana phases is proportional to sin \u03b4, the top-down RG solution\n\nof \u03b4 approaches zero as \u039b goes to MZ . The RGE of \u03b4 might be skipped without affecting\nphysical implication. The RGE of masses to run together with Eq.(7) - Eq.(9) is\n\u1e41i = \u2212mi (2H\u03c4 U\u03c421 \u2212 Hu ).\n\n(10)\n\nFor the SM\n3\n(h\u2212 )2\n32\u03c0 2 \u03c4\n1\n2\n\u2212 2\n\u2212 2\n{3g22 \u2212 2\u03bb \u2212 6(h\u2212\nHu =\nt ) \u2212 6(hb ) \u2212 2(h\u03c4 ) },\n16\u03c0 2\nH\u03c4 =\n\n5\n\n(11)\n\n\fwhile for the MSSM\n1\n(h+ )2\n16\u03c0 2 \u03c4\n1 6 2\n2\n{ g + 6g22 \u2212 6(h+\nHu =\nt ) },\n16\u03c0 2 5 1\n\nH\u03c4 = \u2212\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the Yukawa couplings satisfy the boundary conditions at the SUSY threshold, MS ,\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nat which are h+\nt (MS ) = ht (MS )/ sin \u03b2 and hb,\u03c4 (MS ) = hb,\u03c4 (MS )/ cos \u03b2 [10][11]. The accom-\n\npanied RGE in one-loop order of the gauge couplings, the Yukawa couplings, and the Higgs\ncoupling are taken from the Ref.[10]. As for the boundary condition, the Yukawa couplings\nhb and h\u03c4 are unified at MG = 1016 GeV . The unification of Yukawa couplings as well as\ngauge couplings pass a threshold at MS = 1T eV switching the gauge frame from the SM to\nMSSM. The chosen seesaw scale is MR = 1011 GeV .\nThe running of the mixing angles over scales is very subtle to the type of mass spectrum\ndue to the factor Aij as shown in Eq.(7) - Eq.(9). The current experimental data indicate\nneutrino mass spectrum to be one of the following two cases. First, normal ordering, m1 <\nm2 < m3 , is one candidate, which can be given by\nm21 = m20 ,\nm22 = m20 + \u2206m221 ,\n\n(13)\n\nm23 = m20 + |\u2206m232 |,\nwhere m0 denotes a parameter meaning the lightest mass, and \u2206m221 and |\u2206m232 | are simply\nthe dictation to the results of the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation. The other is\ninverted ordering, m3 < m1 < m2 , which can be given by m23 = m20 , m21 = m20 + |\u2206m232 | \u2212\n\u2206m221 , and m22 = m20 + |\u2206m232 |. Cases of the normal ordering and the inverted ordering will\nbe represented by m0 = m1 and m0 = m3 , respectively, and their effects on RG running of\nthe angles are separated into (a) and (b) in Fig.2 and Fig.3.\nThe strong hierarchy in neutrino masses appears with a small value of m20 so that the value\nof m23 in Eq.(13) could be in order of |\u2206m232 |, while the quasi-degeneracy in masses appears\nwith a large value of m20 so that the value of m23 in Eq.(13) could be in order of m20 . The\nZ\nZ\ninitial conditions in the bottom-up integrations consist of sin \u03b823\n= 0.707, sin \u03b812\n= 0.551,\nZ\nand sin \u03b813\n= 0.10. The upper index Z is used to denote the value evaluated at MZ . The\n\ncurves in Fig.2 explain the running aspects for three types of masses; strong hierarchy, weak\n6\n\n\fFIG. 2: Evolution of sin \u03b823 , sin \u03b812 , and sin \u03b813 for tan \u03b2 = 50.\n\nhierarchy and quasi-degeneracy. The evolutions in angles for quasi-degeneracy are quite\nrapid, which reflect the direct contribution of Aij in Eq.(7) - Eq.(9). In comparison, the\nmasses in strong hierarchy do not help the mixing angles vary as energy scale goes up. In\nFig.3, the influences of tan \u03b2 on the evolution of the angles are featured. The changes in\ncurves for large tan \u03b2 reveal the contribution of H\u03c4 in Eq.(7) - Eq.(9). The Yukawa coupling\nh\u03c4 in H\u03c4 in Eq.(11) is magnified by the factor (cos \u03b2)\u22121 at the threshold MS , as shown in\nEq.(12). Then the curves of sin \u03b8's above the threshold become drastically rapid for a large\ntan \u03b2, as appeared in Fig.3.\nR\nR\nFig.4 and Fig.5 show the solutions of RGE in Eq.(7) - Eq.(9) at MR , (sin \u03b812\n, sin \u03b823\n), which\n\nwill be compared with the angles obligated to the quark-lepton similarity. The upper index\nR is used to denote the value evaluated at MR . Fig.4 describes their continuous dependency\nZ\non m20 at MZ with respect to given values of tan \u03b2 and sin \u03b813\n, while Fig.5 describes their\nZ\ncontinuous dependency on tan \u03b2 with respect to given values of m20 and sin \u03b813\n. The different\nZ\nbrightness in gray curves is originated from a different value in sin \u03b813\n. The first quadrant\n\nof W (\u03b812 , \u03b823 ) = 0 in Fig.1 is substituted in Fig.4 and Fig.5, and so its intersection with a\ncurve will find the angles to make UL similar to UQ . The plots clearly indicate that only the\n\n7\n\n\fFIG. 3: Evolution of sin \u03b823 , sin \u03b812 , and sin \u03b813 for m20 = 0.1.\n\nsolution obtained with large tan \u03b2 and large m0 can make the intersection. On the other\nZ\nZ\nhand, the solutions with small tan \u03b2 and small m0 converge to (sin \u03b812\n, sin \u03b823\n).\nR\nZ\nFrom Fig.2 and Fig.3, it is worth keeping in mind that \u03b813\n. \u03b813\nfor m0 = m1 . Thus,\nR\nthe values of \u03b813\non the gray curves near the similarity shell are all ranged within 0 to 0.1.\n\nIn fact, they are almost close to zero, since the evolution of sin \u03b813 with large tan \u03b2 and\nquasi-degenerate masses approaches zero as the scale goes up. In other words, the solution\nR\nof \u03b813\nin RGE can find its matching point to the similarity just inside the shell drawn in\nR\nFig.4 and Fig.5. Although here the value of \u03b813\nis not specified, the intersection with the\n\nshell between W |sin \u03b813\nR =0 = 0 and W |sin \u03b8 R =0.1 = 0 can guarantee the solution to the similarity\n13\nR\nR\nW (\u03b812\n, \u03b823\n) = 0, technically.\n\nFor inverted mass ordering, as mentioned in Ref.[6], the RG running effect in mixing\nR\nZ\nR\nZ\nangles except for \u03b812 appears as rising as the scale \u039b increases, i.e., \u03b813\n& \u03b813\nand \u03b823\n& \u03b823\n.\n\nThat is opposite to the running effects in \u03b823 and \u03b813 for normal mass ordering. The running\neffect for m0 = m3 case is described in Fig.2(b) and Fig.3(b). The increasing curve in sin \u03b823\nfrom the initial value sin \u03b823 (MZ ) = \u03c0/4 as \u039b increases makes the result of RGE rather away\nfrom the W = 0 shell. Thus, there is no solution to the similarity that is compatible with\n\n8\n\n\fR , sin \u03b8 R ), featuring the dependency on tan \u03b2 with\nFIG. 4: The solutions of RGE at MR , (sin \u03b812\n23\nZ with various gray lines, and the dependency on m2 along\n(a),(b) and (c), the dependency on sin \u03b813\n0\n\nwith the curves.\n\nR , sin \u03b8 R ), featuring the dependency on m2 with (a),(b)\nFIG. 5: The solutions of RGE at MR , (sin \u03b812\n23\n0\nZ with various gray lines, and the dependency on tan \u03b2 along with\nand (c), the dependency on sin \u03b813\n\nthe curves.\n\nthe mass type of m0 = m3 , whether it is hierarchical or quasi-degenerate. Last, even in the\nZ\nmost optimistic case with tan \u03b2 and masses, the initial condition sin \u03b813\n> 0.15 cannot result\n\nin the evolution of angles within the W = 0.\n\n9\n\n\fIV.\n\nDISCUSSION ON PHENOMENOLOGICAL IMPLICATION\n\nThe Standard Model and its extension for massive neutrinos can be considered as an\neffective theory stemmed from a fundamental theory such as GUT. If a mechanism like\nSeesaw Mechanism makes the basis of leptons different from that of quarks pointing the\nsignificant distinction between them in masses and mixing angles, there could exist the\nsimilarity between CKM and PMNS, which means that one is the similar transformation of\nthe other. The allowed ranges in lepton mixing angles are strongly restricted by the similarity\nconstraint. The similarity was applied at MR , and the angles at the scale were evaluated\nas results of RGE under various combination of the initial conditions with m0 , tan \u03b2, and\nZ\nsin \u03b813\n.\n\nThe physical implication from the quark lepton similarity is summarized as follows: First,\nthe inverse ordered mass type of neutrino, either hierarchical or quasi-degenerate, is ruled\nout. Second, only normal ordered quasi-degenerate mass type of neutrino can satisfy the\nZ\nsimilarity, while the normal hierarchy mass type does not. Third, a value of sin \u03b813\nlarger\n\nthan 0.15 is ruled out, and a small value is preferred. Last, small tan \u03b2 cannot result in the\nRG effect to be compatible to the similarity. Thus, the prediction from the model will be\ntested by the current experiments to look for SUSY signals like LHC and the various types\nof neutrino oscillation experiments. Especially, the transition probability in super-beam\nneutrino oscillation may take advantage of the capability to predict s13 cos \u03b4 or s13 sin \u03b4 as\nin Eq.(6) , not to predict simply s13 or \u03b4, since that can reduce the ambiguity, so-called\ndegeneracy problem, caused from multiple parameters[12][13].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nK.S. thanks members in the Physics Department at Cheonnam National University for\nwarm hospitality, where a part of this work was completed.
