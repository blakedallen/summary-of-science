Properties of interest in the observed IMFs of young associations are the\nhigher-mass slope, the mass at which the IMF reaches a\nmaximum (turn-over mass or characteristic mass) and the\nbrown dwarf to star ratio. The local Universe high-mass IMF\nseems to be universal within the expected uncertainties, following a power-law with approximately the Salpeter index\n(e.g., Massey, Johnson & DeGioia-Eastwood 1995; for a review see Elmegreen 2008). However, at the lower mass end\nimportant differences have become apparent.\nIn recent years, substantial advances have been made\nin the study of the low-mass and substellar IMF, especially in four nearby star forming regions: Taurus (Luhman\n2004), IC 348 (Luhman et al. 2003), Chamaeleon I (Luhman\n2007) and the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC, Muench et al.\n2002; Slesnick, Hillenbrand & Carpenter 2004). These populations sample different star-forming environments, from\nTaurus that represents the best studied example of star for-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: joana@astro.keele.ac.uk\n\nmation at low (stellar and gas) density to the ONC that\nis a relatively extreme environment (when compared to\nthese other associations), being much denser and having\na high-mass population that extends to massive O-stars. The\nlow-mass IMF for these four regions shows important variations, namely in the turn-over mass and the brown dwarf\nto star ratio (Luhman et al. 2006; Luhman 2007). This suggests a dependence of the IMF properties on the conditions\nof star formation. Star formation theories by fragmentation (Bate & Bonnell 2005; Bonnell et al. 2007), core ejection (e.g., Reipurth & Clarke 2001) and core evaporation\n(e.g., Whitworth & Zinnecker 2004) predict changes in the\nbrown dwarf fraction and/or characteristic mass of the IMF\ndepending on local environmental conditions (e.g., molecular cloud density, radiation field). Constraining any environmental dependence of the IMF might help pin down which\nphysical parameters are important in shaping it.\nThe massive stars in the young cluster NGC 6611\nare responsible for the ionisation of the H ii region M 16,\nthe Eagle Nebula. Indeed, just the 3 most massive stars\nin the cluster central area emit \u223c 5 times more ionising radiation than the central Trapezium cluster of the\nONC. NGC 6611 cluster members are distributed over a\nregion of \u223c14 arcmin radius, with a higher concentration\nin the largely unobscured 4 arcmin radius central area\n(Belikov et al. 2000). Recent distance determinations, de-\n\n\f2\nrived using spectroscopic parallaxes (Dufton et al. 2006)\nand main-sequence turnoff (Bonatto, Santos & Bica 2006;\nGuarcello et al. 2007), favour values around 1.8 kpc. The\ncluster contains a large number of massive stars as well\nas a large population of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars\n(Hillenbrand et al. 1993; Oliveira et al. 2005). The total observed mass of NGC 6611 is at least a factor \u223c 2 larger\nthan that of the ONC (Bonatto, Santos & Bica 2006).\nThis cluster is very young, with an age of 2\u22123 Myr\n(Hillenbrand et al. 1993; Belikov et al. 2000). A considerable age spread (< 1\u22126 Myr) has been reported for sources\nin the Eagle Nebula (Hillenbrand et al. 1993; Belikov et al.\n2000; Dufton et al. 2006) but Indebetouw et al. (2007) find\nno clear evidence of age gradients throughout the region.\nA rich low-mass (M & 0.5 M\u2299 ) PMS population was identified by Oliveira et al. (2005) concentrated towards the most\nmassive NGC 6611 cluster members. Many of these young\nstars retain dusty circumstellar discs, identified by L-band\nexcesses. For a comprehensive review on NGC 6611 and the\nEagle Nebula see Oliveira (2008).\nIn this paper we discuss new Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) observations of the central area of NGC 6611 at optical and near-IR wavelengths. These new observations are the\ndeepest to date in this region, reaching well into the brown\ndwarf regime. We construct the low-mass IMF from intermediate to substellar masses by combining the HST dataset\nwith ground-based photometry from Oliveira et al. (2005).\nThis manuscript is organised as follows. Firstly we describe\nthe HST data and its reduction process and the photometry\nand its calibration. This is followed by the PMS identification, reddening determinations and completeness and contamination corrections, both for the HST data and groundbased data. Finally, we construct the IMF for NGC 6611 and\ncompare its main features (slope, characteristic mass and\nbrown dwarf to star ratio) to other well studied young clusters and associations. We discuss the implications in terms\nof the environmental impact on the IMF and star and brown\ndwarf formation scenarios.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nHST observations\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope images of the core of NGC 6611\ndescribed here were obtained as part of the cycle 14 programme number 10533 (P.I. J.M. Oliveira). Optical images\nwere obtained with the Wide Field Channel (WFC) of the\nAdvanced Camera for Surveys (ACS, Boffi et al. 2007). A\nsingle ACS/WFC field was observed through the F775W\nand F850LP filters (roughly corresponding to ground-based\nI and Z). With a \u223c 0.05\u2032\u2032 pixel scale and two 2K \u00d7 4K detectors, the WFC field-of-view is \u223c 3.4\u2032 \u00d7 3.4\u2032 . The system gain\nwas set to 2 to completely sample the full-well-depth (as\nopposed to \u223c 75% for gain 1), resulting in only a modest increase in readnoise and a significant increase in the dynamic\nrange of the observations. The total exposure time per filter is 2 000 s, split into 4 dithered exposures of 500 s. This\ncorresponds to one HST orbit per filter. The observations\nwere designed to probe well into the brown dwarf regime,\nreaching down for the first time in such a distant cluster to\n\u223c 0.02 M\u2299 .\n\nN\n\nACS/WFC\n\nE\n\n1'\n\nNICMOS\n\n1'\nFigure 1. Top: true colour image of NGC 6611 showing the\nACS/WFC field (I-band in blue and Z-band in red). The field\ncentre is at \u03b1=18:18:41.72 & \u03b4=\u221213:47:35.0. The Eagle Nebula\npillars are located to the south-east of this field, approximately\n3\u2032 away. Bottom: true colour image showing the NICMOS mosaic\n(J-band in blue and H-band in red).\n\nNear-Infrared images were obtained with the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS,\nBarket et al. 2007) onboard HST. The camera used was\nNIC2 with a 19.2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 19.2\u2032\u2032 field-of-view and 0.075\u2032\u2032 pixels.\nWe observed 25 NIC2 fields to form a mosaic covering\n\u223c 2.5 arcmin2 . The NIC2 field positions were chosen in such\na way as to avoid the bright stars in the field (Fig. 1). The filters used are F110W and F160W. These correspond loosely\nto ground-based J and H filters, but the reader should note\nthat the F110W is much broader than any other commonly\nused J-band filters (0.8\u22121.4 \u03bcm). The total exposure time\nper field per filter is 128 s, split into 4 dithered exposures. To\nobserve all 25 fields in both filters 5 HST orbits were needed.\nThe area covered by the HST observations in NGC 6611 is\nshown in Fig. 1.\n\n\fThe low-mass IMF in NGC 6611\n2.2\n\nACS/WFC calibrations and PSF photometry\n\nThe ACS reduction pipeline consists of two main stages: the\nfirst corrects for instrumental effects and produces calibrated\ndata products including appropriate photometry keywords\n(CALACS); the second corrects for the significant geometric\ndistortion in WFC images, performs cosmic ray rejection and\ncombines associated dithered data using drizzle techniques\n(MultiDrizzle, Pavlovsky et al. 2006). For our programme,\nthe HST pipeline results were a single astrometrically and\nphotometrically calibrated image for each filter (\"drz images\" in units of e\u2212 s\u22121 ). The photometric zeropoints are\n25.256 and 24.326 mag respectively for I and Z (VEGAMAG magnitude system, Sirianni et al. 2005). Point Spread\nFunction (PSF) photometry was performed on these pipeline\nimages as described below.\nPSF fitting packages use an optimal weighting scheme\nthat depends on the true counts per pixel as well as readout\nnoise and gain. To properly compute the charge transfer\nefficiency (CTE) correction (see below) it is also necessary\nto have the total number of electrons instead of electron rate.\nTherefore, before applying the photometric algorithms, the\ndrz images were multiplied by the total exposure time and\nthe average background sky level was added back to the\nimages (see extensive discussion by Sirianni et al. 2005).\nStellar photometry was obtained using the DAOPHOT\npackage (Stetson 1987) within PyRAF1 (Davis 1994), modelling the spatially variable PSF independently for each filter. Standard object detection and aperture photometry algorithms were used to detect and compute preliminary magnitudes. PSFs were constructed using a large number of stars\nwell distributed across the images (respectively 134 and 160\nstars for the I- and Z-bands). Stars were chosen to be bright\nso that the PSF in the core and wings could be well described but not brighter than \u223c18.5 mag; above this limit\nthere are clear non-linearity effects and the PSF profiles\nof those stars no longer match the profiles of fainter stars.\nAn elliptical Moffat function was chosen for the functional\nform of the analytical component of the PSF model and this\nmodel was allowed to vary quadratically with position in\nthe image. Once appropriate PSF models were computed,\nthe ALLSTAR function was used to compute photometry\nfor all the stars in the frame; approximately 16 000 objects\nhave measured PSF photometry in each frame. As can be\nseen in Fig. 1, the ACS images contain a number of bright\nstars that saturate the exposures and cause leakage artifacts.\nThese artifacts cause a large number of spurious detections\ndistributed mostly in halos around the bright stars and on\nspikes along affected columns and/or rows.\nThe PSF photometry output files contain two output\nparameters that together with the magnitude error can be\nused to filter out spurious detections. The sharpness parameter estimates the intrinsic angular size of the object: stellar\nobjects should have a value around zero (with a larger scatter for fainter magnitudes), while large negative and positive\nvalues identify respectively cosmic rays and other blemishes\nand resolved galaxies and blended objects. The \u03c72 parameter measures the goodness-of-the-fit and should be around\n\nunity with no noticeable trend with magnitude. As mentioned above, bright but unsaturated stars are affected by\nnon-linearity effects so the measured \u03c72 is somewhat larger\nfor these objects. A very good description on how imposing\ncuts to these parameters is used to eliminate spurious detections in catalogues can be found in Rejkuba et al. (2005).\nThe photometric errors, sharpness and \u03c72 parameters were\nthus used to refine each photometry catalogue and then the I\nand Z detections were cross-correlated. As both filters were\nobserved in the same visit the positional drifts between the\nimages are negligible, so the catalogues were matched in X\nand Y pixel positions before astrometry was performed: 3462\nobjects were detected in the combined IZ catalogue.\nThe ACS CCD detectors suffer from scattered light at\nlong wavelengths (from about 7 500 \u00c5) and the fraction of\nintegrated light in the scattered light halo increases as a\nfunction of wavelength. The amount of light contained in\nthe halo will also be larger the redder the stellar source,\ni.e. the shape of the observed PSF depends on the colour\nof the star, something that PSF fitting algorithms cannot\naccount for. The best way to mitigate for this is to compute\ncolour-dependent aperture corrections. Therefore, we were\nonly able to calibrate in this way objects that are detected\nin both the I- and Z-band filters. The halo effect and the\nprescription on how to correct for it are described in detail in\nSirianni et al. (2005) and we provide here only a summary.\nA useful quantity to help estimate colour-dependent\naperture corrections is the effective wavelength \u03bbeff that represents the mean wavelength of the detected photons. This\nsource-dependent passband parameter can be used to quantify changes in the stellar light encircled in a radius r as a\nfunction of the stellar colour. Once \u03bbeff is determined for\neach source and each filter, Sirianni et al. (2005) provides a\ntabulated relation between \u03bbeff and aperture correction for\nseveral aperture radii.\nTo define a relation between \u03bbeff and observable instrumental colour we used the function calcphot in synphot (Laidler et al. 2005) and a large number of stellar template spectra. We used the following spectral atlases: the\nBruzual-Persson-Gunn-Stryker atlas available within synphot (spectral types to early M) and the atlas of M, L and\nT type dwarfs compiled by Sandy Leggett2 with spectra\nfrom several authors (Leggett et al. 2000; Knapp et al. 2004;\nChiu et al. 2006). In total over 300 spectra were used from\nearly-type stars to T-dwarfs. With calcphot, we computed instrumental I\u2212Z colours, \u03bbeff,I and \u03bbeff,Z to construct a linear\nrelation equivalent to that shown in Fig. 11 of Sirianni et al.\n(2005). For the objects in our combined IZ catalogue, we\nmeasured their instrumental colour, interpolated to estimate \u03bbeff,I and \u03bbeff,Z , and interpolated Sirianni's Table 6\nto obtain colour-dependent aperture corrections. Computed\naperture corrections are in the ranges 0.22\u22120.25 mag and\n0.42\u22120.55 mag, respectively for I and Z.\nAnother effect that needs to be corrected for is the\nposition- and time-dependent decrease in the CCD's charge\ntransfer efficiency (CTE, Riess & Mack 2004). A photometric correction can be applied that depends on the stellar flux\nand sky levels, on the Y position in the chip and on the time\ninterval since the start of ACS operations. Using the pre-\n\n1\n\nPyRAF is a command language for running IRAF tasks that\nis based on the Python scripting language.\n\n3\n\n2\n\nhttp://www.jach.hawaii.edu/\u223cskl/LTdata.html\n\n\f4\nscription and coefficients described in Riess & Mack (2004)\nwe computed magnitude corrections of up to 0.05 mag and\n0.08 mag respectively for I and Z.\nOnce all these photometric corrections were applied, astrometry was performed using the IRAF task xy2rd. Astrometry was performed individually in the I and Z images\nand the positions were averaged. No absolute astrometry\nwas performed at this stage. The final IZ catalogue reaches\ndown to I = 26 mag and Z = 24 mag, with photometric\nerrors \u223c 0.12 mag and \u223c 0.08 mag respectively.\n\n2.3\n\nNIC2 mosaics, calibrations and aperture\nphotometry\n\nThe NICMOS pipeline consists of two main stages: the first\ncorrects for instrumental effects (CALNICA) and the second combines images obtained in a dither pattern and subtracts the sky background from the images (CALNICB).\nDue to the way in which the observations were designed, the\npipeline combines the 4 dithered exposures for each field but\nit does not combine the 25 fields in a single mosaic. Crucially\nthe pipeline does not correct for the geometric distortion,\nthe largest component of that distortion being a large difference in the X and Y platescales. The best way to correct\nfor these distortions and simultaneously construct complete\nmosaics for each of the J and H filters is to use the routine multidrizzle in PyRAF on the output frames from the\nCALNICA step, i.e on the 25 \u00d7 4 images per filter. This routine works in a very similar way to the second pipeline step\nfor the ACS images. Mosaics were constructed for J and H\nwith a final pixel scale of 0.05\u2032\u2032 , that conveniently matches\nthe WFC pixel scale.\nBefore the images were mosaiced they were corrected for\nthe NICMOS count-rate- and wavelength-dependent nonlinearity (de Jong 2006). This correction is not applied by\nthe pipeline reduction process but a separate Python routine is available3 . The non-linearity correction amounts to\n0.063 mag offset per dex change in incident flux for J and\n0.029 mag per dex in H. The routine changes the count\nrates in the output images and therefore new zero-points\nare needed: 24.561 and 23.863 mag respectively for J and H\n(VEGAMAG magnitude) for images in units of e\u2212 s\u22121 .\nWe initially attempted to perform PSF photometry on\nthe J and H images as well. However, NIC2 undersamples the PSF at these wavelengths and the PSF profile is\nrather complex (Krist et al. 1998); as a result we found that\nthe quality of the PSF fits was not good, particularly for\nthe H-band. As our images are not crowded, we opted to\nuse aperture photometry instead. Approximately 5 000 and\n10 000 sources were detected in J and H respectively; a large\nnumber of these are spurious detections (e.g., artifacts near\nbright stars and at the edge of individual frames etc) that\ncan be removed by combining these catalogues with the IZ\ncatalogue. Aperture corrections were computed using 60\u221280\nunsaturated bright stars. Astrometry was performed on the\nJ and H catalogues as described above for the ACS images. Possible deficiencies in using aperture photometry are\n\n3\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/hst/nicmos/performance/anomalies/\nnonlinearity.html\n\ncorrected for with a careful computation of completeness\ncorrections described in Section 3.1.3.\n2.4\n\nGround-based complementary data\n\nTo complement our HST catalogue at the brighter end (the\nHST images saturate for PMS objects of just over a solar\nmass), we used the optical and IR catalogue described in\nOliveira et al. (2005), that covers a much larger area in the\ncentral region of NGC 6611. For a complete description of\nthe observations and data reduction the reader should refer\nto that article. Their catalogue includes I and Z Cousins\nmagnitudes and JHK photometry in the MKO-IR system\n(Tokunaga, Simons & Vacca 2002).\nAs noted above the HST filters are very different from\ngroundbased filter sets and it is not trivial to convert between those systems as significant colour terms are expected\n(especially for cool PMS objects) due to the very different\nfilter bandwidths. Even though there are a number of objects\nobserved in both HST and groundbased filter sets, these are\nfew and crucially they are at the bright/blue end of the HST\ndata and therefore the colour range is not sufficient to derive reliable magnitude conversions. Furthermore we have\nto use two different sets of PMS isochrones, as no single\nset covers the whole mass range we are addressing in this\nmanuscript, from several solar masses down to the substellar regime. Therefore we have made no attempt to merge\nthese two photometric catalogues.\nThe groundbased catalogue reaches down to \u223c 0.5 M\u2299\nand thus provides a good overlap in PMS stellar masses\nwith the HST catalogue. As described below we construct\ncluster IMFs over different mass ranges (over the same area\nand using methods that are similar whenever possible) and\ncombine them for the total IMF analysis.\n\n3\n\nCOLOUR-MAGNITUDE AND\nCOLOUR-COLOUR DIAGRAM ANALYSIS\n\n3.1\n\nLow-mass stars and brown dwarfs\n\nThe IZ, J and H HST catalogues were combined based on\ntheir astrometry. As can be seen in Fig. 1 the J and H images cover roughly a quarter of the I and Z images. In the\noverlapping region 729 objects have IZJH photometry - I\nband magnitudes are the limiting ones. This is the HST catalogue from which pre-main-sequence stars are going to be selected based on several colour-magnitude diagrams (Fig. 2).\n3.1.1\n\nIdentification of PMS stars and membership\nselection\n\nFig. 2 shows the colour-magnitude diagrams used to identify the pre-main-sequence (PMS) population in NGC 6611.\nThese young stars are cooler than field stars of the same apparent magnitude and thus can be easily identified in such\ndiagrams. Selection criteria are shown in the figure, based on\nthe observed I magnitude and I \u2212Z, I \u2212J, and J \u2212H colours\nand the position of theoretical isochrones (Baraffe et al.\n1998). Using these criteria 290 stars are identified as PMS\ncandidates and as such, candidate low-mass members of\nNGC 6611 (Table 1, complete in electronic form only).

The straight lines indicate the regions for selection of PMS candidates:\nopen circles are all objects with IZJH photometry while filled circles mark the PMS candidates. Note the large number of heavily\nobscured stars towards the Galactic centre with J \u2212 H \u223c 2 \u2212 3 mag. PMS isochrones for 2 Myr (full line) and 3 Myr (dashed line) from\nBaraffe et al.

(2008) for distance and extinction consistent with an evolved population in the Scutum-Crux spiral arm (see text). Blue\nsquares and stars are Upper Scorpius (Kraus et al. 2005) and Taurus (Kraus et al. 2006) very low-mass and brown dwarf cluster members,\nof ages respectively \u223c 5 Myr and 1\u22122 Myr, observed with the same filters and placed at the same distance and average extinction as\nNGC 6611.\n\nTable 1. NGC 6611 cluster candidates selected from the HST photometric catalogue. Absolute astrometry was performed on this\ncatalogue using the positions of \u223c 40 bright stars that are also detected in the catalogue of Oliveira et al. (2005), that was astrometrically\ncalibrated against 2MASS. The precision in the positions is better than 0.04\" in each coordinate. Columns provide the magnitudes and\nerrors for I, Z, J and H. E(B \u2212 V )2Myr and E(B \u2212 V )3Myr are the extinction determinations using the 2 or 3 Myr isochrones. Based\non these determinations, candidates are classified as members (0.45 < E(B \u2212 V ) < 1.0 mag) or non-members (see Section 3.1.2). M2Myr\nand M3Myr are the masses of PMS objects, assuming either an age of 2 or 3 Myr.

The position\n\n4\n\nThese objects were observed with the same filters but with the\nHST ACS/HRC camera; very small colour-dependent transformations are applied to convert the ACS/HRC measurements to\nmagnitudes as would be observed with the ACS/WFC camera.\n\n\f6\nof these objects in the diagram shows that our selection region is generous enough to include a PMS population of age\n< 5 Myr; our selection therefore should not exclude any PMS\nobjects.\nThe foreground loci in the colour-magnitude diagrams\nare sparsely populated so contamination by foreground\ndwarfs is not large; this was expected since the area we are\nanalysing is relatively small. The cuts shown in the figure,\nin particular the cut in J \u2212 H colour, are also very effective in separating the PMS population from the large number of heavily reddened stars towards the Galactic centre.\nThese stars delineate a well-defined sequence with I \u2212 Z,\nI \u2212 J and J \u2212 H colours in the narrow ranges 2\u22123, 4.5\u22126\nand 2\u22122.5 mag respectively. Our HST survey is so deep that\nin order to understand the nature of this heavily reddened\npopulation we need to consider what lies behind the cluster\ntowards the Galactic centre.\nThe line-of-sight towards the Eagle Nebula encounters\nthe Scutum-Crux spiral arm at a distance of < 4 kpc (Vall\u00e9e\n2008). Recent three-dimensional Galactic insterstellar extinction maps (based on 2MASS data, Marshall et al. 2006)\nshow that behind NGC 6611 there is a marked extinction\njump consistent with the location of this spiral arm: between\n2.8\u22123.5 kpc from the Sun, extinction as measured by AK increases from \u223c 0.6 to \u223c 1.4 mag. This suggests that the distinct clump of reddened stars could be part of the ScutumCrux spiral arm structure. To test this hypothesis we use\nevolutionary tracks from Marigo et al. (2008) for a 5 Gyr-old\npopulation and solar metallicity, computed for the HST ACS\nand NICMOS filter sets. Two such tracks are shown in Fig. 2:\nthe bluest for a distance of 2 500 kpc and AV = 13 mag and\nthe reddest for 3 500 kpc and AV = 17 mag. These tracks encompass the observed population very well. Therefore, even\nthough the distance and extinction estimates are very approximate, the population with redder colours is entirely\nconsistent with what we would expect for a population in\nthat spiral arm, at a range of distances and extinctions consistent with the 2MASS extinction profile. This population,\nthat would include both main-sequence and evolved stars,\nseems to be an important source of contamination. However,\nFig. 2 shows that these stars are so much redder than genuine cluster members that they are effectively excluded by\nthe J \u2212 H cut we apply for PMS selection. Other sources of\ncontamination are discussed further in Section 3.1.4.\n3.1.2\n\nCluster reddening and de-reddening of PMS stars\n\nThe first step to analyse a PMS population in a region like\nNGC 6611 is to determine intrinsic magnitudes, i.e to correct for reddening. Many authors have studied the extinction\nproperties towards the Eagle Nebula (e.g., Hillenbrand et al.\n1993; Belikov et al. 1999, 2000; Dufton et al. 2006); the optical extinction (AV ) is variable and the values of RV (the\nratio of total to selective extinction), estimated on a star by\nstar basis, are larger than the normal interstellar medium\nvalue. Reported RV values are in the range 3.5\u22124.8 (typical value \u223c 3.75, Hillenbrand et al. 1993) while E(B \u2212 V )\nvalues vary between 0.5\u22121.1 mag. Towards the NGC 6611\ncluster extinction is however at the lower end of this range\n(Belikov et al. 1999; Indebetouw et al. 2007).\nThe way in which we designed the NICMOS observations (i.e. avoiding the bright stars) means that we do\n\nFigure 3. Schematic diagram showing our survey area and published measurements of E(B \u2212 V ) towards O and B stars in\nNGC 6611, from Dufton et al. (2006) and Belikov et al. (1999,\n2000). The typical value for the survey area is E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c\n0.70 mag, with measurements in the range 0.45 to 1 mag.\n\nnot have independent extinction determinations towards\nthe survey area. However, as can be seen from Fig. 3, that\narea is surrounded by many stars with reddening measurements. Thus a typical E(B \u2212 V ) towards the survey area\nis of the order of 0.70 mag with an observed spread of\n\u223c 0.45\u22121.0 mag, corresponding to AV \u223c 2.6 mag and a range\nof \u223c 1.7\u22123.75 mag - we adopt RV = 3.75 for cluster members. Thus, extinction is relatively low in the central cluster\narea but it is also variable even at small spatial scales.\nAccordingly we have opted to compute extinction towards individual PMS candidates using the two colourcolour diagrams shown in Fig. 4. Also shown are the\nBaraffe et al. (1998) PMS isochrones (these authors have\nproduced absolute magnitudes for the 4 HST filters used in\nthis analysis). Using the stellar spectral atlas and procedure\ndescribed previously, we compute HST colours for a large\nnumber of dwarfs in order to construct a dwarf locus down\nto spectral type M8\u2212M9. Reddening vectors are computed\nusing the same template spectra and the reddening curve\nof Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis (1989) adopting RV = 3.75:\nthe spectra are reddened with a range of E(B \u2212 V ) values and synphot is used to estimate the extincted colours\nthrough the HST filters. The resulting reddening slopes are\nA(I) = 2.435 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ), A(Z) = 1.86 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ),\nA(J) = 1.30 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ) and A(H) = 0.76 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ).\nPMS stars have lower surface gravities than mainsequence dwarf stars, and thus populate colour-colour diagrams in the region between dwarfs and giants (see also\nOliveira, Jeffries & van Loon 2004). As can be seen from\nFig. 4 there are sizable differences between the isochrones\nand the determined dwarf loci. We did not have many late-M\ndwarf spectra available to constrain the reddest loci colours,\nand we do not see evidence in our dataset of the sharp turn\nto redder J \u2212 H colours that seems to occur for these spec-\n\n\fThe low-mass IMF in NGC 6611\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Colour-colour diagrams for the PMS candidates selected from the HST photometric catalogue. The full and dashed blue\nlines are Baraffe et al. (1998) isochrones, respectively for 2 and 3 Myr. The dotted lines represented the reddening band derived for the\nHST filters. Dwarfs from an archival spectral atlas (see text) were used to empirically derive the dwarf loci (red lines, to spectral type\nM8\u2212M9). Filled circles are the PMS objects with final reddening determination between 0.45 and 1.0 mag (see Fig. 5).\n\ntral types: the variation of the J \u2212 H colour for M-dwarfs is\n\u223c 0.4 mag, while for our PMS candidates the observed J \u2212H\nspread is \u223c 0.3 mag, even with possible variable extinction\neffects. We have therefore decided to de-redden the PMS\ncandidates using the set of PMS isochrones that are being\nused for the mass determination (Baraffe et al. 1998).\nFig. 4 shows that the Baraffe isochrones in the colourcolour diagrams are somewhat age-dependent. The dependence is small and only affects stars in a small range of observed colours. Nevertheless, we adopt two values for the age\nof NGC 6611, 2 and 3 Myr, consistent with the higher mass\npopulation (Hillenbrand et al. 1993; Belikov et al. 2000).\nWe will keep these calculations completely independent, i.e\nwe obtain independent IMFs for these two assumed ages in\norder to isolate the effect of fixing the age of the population.\nUsing the reddening vector and the isochrones, E(B \u2212\nV ) is computed for each star in each diagram; when available the two estimated E(B \u2212 V ) values are averaged. Error\nbars are computed for these estimates, including contributions from photometric errors in the observed colours and\nthe uncertainty introduced by the choice of the reddening\nvector - the reddening vector slope changes somewhat depending on the spectral energy distribution of the star, see\nprevious discussion on \u03bbeff .\nA feature in these diagrams are the 32 stars that cannot be de-reddened because they do not have a reddening\nvector intersection with the isochrones. Three of these objects are too red for the available theoretical colours. The\nremaining 29 objects have observed J \u2212 H colours that seem\ntoo red for their observed I \u2212 J and I \u2212 Z colours and\nthus cannot be de-reddened onto the PMS loci. Closer inspection of Fig. 4 suggests that the majority of those stars\nwould be too reddened to be considered bona-fide cluster members. These stars are relatively bright thus if they\nwere NGC 6611 members they should have an intrinsic PMS\n\n(J \u2212 H)0 . 0.9 mag. If we de-redden these objects using\nonly their J \u2212 H colour to a conservative intrinsic colour\nof (J \u2212 H)0 = 0.9 mag, the estimated E(B \u2212 V ) for most\nobjects would be in the range 1.0\u22121.7 mag with only three\nobjects having E(B \u2212 V ) < 1.0 mag. Therefore of these 29\nobjects all but 3 would be rejected for having reddening too\nlarge when compared to the reddening distribution of more\nreliable cluster members (see Fig. 5 and discussion on reddening cuts below). It is likely that these objects are actually\nbehind the cluster and not PMS objects.\nSome earlier type stars fall in the region of the diagrams\nwhere the de-reddening procedure has two solutions. For\nthese stars we computed two extinction solutions, i.e. one to\nthe\"late-type branch\" (with 0.9 < J \u2212H < 1.0 mag) and one\nto the \"early-type branch\" (with 0.6 < J \u2212H < 0.9 mag). We\nfind that the E(B \u2212 V ) values determined to the \"late-type\nbranch\" are consistent with the E(B \u2212 V ) cluster distribution (Fig. 5). We note that the extinction determinations for\nthese objects have larger error bars reflecting the uncertainties of the procedure.\nFig. 5 shows the histograms of E(B \u2212 V ) values determined towards PMS candidates. The mean of the distribution is consistent with the average E(B \u2212 V ) measured towards massive cluster members (Fig. 3). Its standard deviation is of the order of 0.15 mag; when compared\nto the typical E(B \u2212 V ) error of 0.07 mag this again suggests that local variations of extinction are real, as can be\nseen from the images themselves and Fig. 3. The range of\nE(B \u2212 V ) values in Fig. 5 (0 < E(B \u2212 V ) < 1.5 mag)\nis larger than the range measured towards massive cluster\nmembers (0.45 < E(B \u2212 V ) < 1.0 mag), suggesting that\nthe PMS candidate sample includes some foreground and\nbackground contaminants. We use these histograms to refine cluster membership: objects that have E(B \u2212 V ) values\nin the range 0.45\u22121.0 mag (the same as the massive clus-\n\n\f8\n3.1.3\n\nCompleteness correction\n\nMany bright stars are saturated in the HST images and create image artifacts that can prevent the detection of fainter\nstars nearby. We also need to characterise the reduced detection sensitivity at the fainter end. In order to address the\nissue of completeness of the photometric catalogues we construct fake star simulations: replicas of PMS stars (i.e. stars\nwith true PMS magnitudes in I, Z, J and H), randomly\nselected from the observed I-band luminosity function, are\nintroduced into the 4 HST images, at random positions. For\nsimplicity in generating the randomised star positions, this\nexperiment was performed in the central 1.2 arcmin2 area of\nthe survey. One hundred sets of fake stars were created, each\nwith 100 randomly selected PMS replicas. In each simulation\nthe number of objects in the central region was increased by\nabout 1/4, thus not changing the crowding properties of the\nfield in any significant way.\n\nFigure 5. Histograms of the E(B \u2212 V ) determinations, using\nthe 2 Myr (full line) and 3 Myr (dotted line) isochrones. These\ndeterminations are consistent with the average E(B \u2212 V ) towards\nmassive cluster members (E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.7 mag). Vertical dashed\nlines show the cuts used to refine membership (see text).\n\nter members) are kept in the PMS sample. Our survey is\nso deep that reddened stars behind the cluster can contaminate the PMS selection (Section 3.1.1). The upper reddening\ncut is essential to exclude as many of those objects as possible (see Section 3.1.4); the lower cut eliminates some foreground dwarfs. We note that, so long as reddening is not\nmass dependent and the intrinsic loci and reddening vectors\nare not in error in a mass-dependent way, then reddening\ncuts should not affect the derived shape of the IMF, even if\nthey were too stringent.\nOliveira et al. (2005) determined that approximately 55% of the objects brighter than I = 19 mag\nshow an excess in the L\u2032 -band indicative of the\npresence of a circumstellar disc, while only \u223c 18%\nof those objects show such an excess in the Kband. IZJH magnitudes are generally much less\nsensitive to disc excesses (e.g., Oliveira et al. 2005;\nRobitaille et al. 2007) and therefore this should not\nsignificantly affect our reddening determinations.\nNevertheless, our reddening cuts (see above) are\ngenerous enough to accommodate uncertainties in\nthe reddening determination.\nThe final PMS sample includes 208 objects. Once extinction is computed, intrinsic I-band magnitudes are calculated, taking care to propagate the errors introduced by the\nextinction calculation. Then assuming either an age of 2 or\n3 Myr and adopting a distance of 1.8 kpc, masses are computed for each object using their intrinsic I-band magnitudes\nand the Baraffe et al. (1998) isochrones. For this sample, estimated masses range from 0.02 to 1.5 M\u2299 (Table 1). In the\nnext sections we deal with two crucial issues in IMF analysis:\ncompleteness and contamination.\n\nIn order to introduce the replica PMS stars in the images we use the PSFs determined for each filter and the\naddstar procedure in IRAF. As described in Section 2.3, for\nthe J and H band we computed PSFs for the mosaics but\nultimately opted to use aperture photometry in the final catalogue. We tested the procedure of adding stars to the mosaics using the computed PSFs and then performing aperture photometry on those stars and it works well: stars are\nrecovered at a similar rate as for the I and Z images and\ntheir magnitudes are preserved.\nThe complete data reduction procedure, exactly as described in the previous sections, was repeated for each of\nthe 100 simulations, including (PSF or aperture) photometry, aperture and linearity corrections, astrometry, catalogue\nmatching etc and PMS selection. Finally the input and recovered I-band luminosity functions are compared: of the\n10 000 stars simulated 9 301 were recovered. The recovered\nstars are not only detected in I, Z, J and H but they also\nhave colours consistent with PMS selection, i.e. of the PMS\nstars simulated approximately 93% are recovered and selected as PMS objects. This is what we mean by \"recovery\nrate\".\nFig. 6 shows the recovery rate as a function of I-band\nmagnitude, as well as the histograms for the simulated and\nrecovered I-band magnitudes. There is a slight magnitude creep, i.e. more stars are recovered in some\nof the brighter magnitude bins than were originally\nsimulated (Naylor et al. 2002), due either to statistical uncertainty or to the presence of another star\nnearby (see also Stetson 1991). As at the brighter\nend no stars are lost, this can result in a recovery\nrate larger than 1 for some bins. At the fainter end\nthe recovery rate is as low as 35%. We should point\nout that in the combined IZJH catalogue completeness effects are mostly introduced by the I and Z catalogues: the\nJ- and H-band images are deeper and are less affected by\nsaturation artifacts. To construct the completeness function\nwe fitted a second-degree polynomial to the recovery rate\nfor I < 18 mag; for brighter magnitudes the recovery is constant at \u223c 1. For each object in the PMS sample a weight is\nassigned equal to the inverse of the completeness correction\nat its observed I-band magnitude; these weights are used to\ncompute completeness-corrected IMFs.\n\n\fThe low-mass IMF in NGC 6611\n\nFigure 6. Completeness correction versus I-band magnitude. The\nhistogram (with poissonian error bars) shows the recovery rate as\na function of magnitude (see text). The full line is a second-degree\npolynomial used to represent the completeness correction as a\nfunction of I-band magnitude. The inset shows the histograms of\nsimulated and recovered I-band magnitudes.\n\n3.1.4\n\nField star contamination\n\nTo make a quantitative estimate of the effect of contamination in our catalogues we follow the procedure first outlined by Jeffries et al. (2004). Firstly, a field star population is simulated using an I-band luminosity function for\ndwarfs in the Galactic disc. We adopt the disc M dwarf\nI-band luminosity function \u03a6(MI ) of Zheng et al. (2004),\ncomplemented at the brighter end with \u03a6(MV ) compiled\nby Reid & Hawley (2000), where \u03a6(MV ) is converted to\n\u03a6(MI ) using average V \u2212 I dwarf colours (Leggett 1992;\nLeggett et al. 1996). Using this luminosity function (LF\nin units of stars pc\u22123 mag\u22121 ) as a weighting function, absolute I-magnitudes and intrinsic colours were randomly\nassigned to a very large number of simulated stars. The\nspatial density of stars is described by N0 exp(\u2212(R \u2212\nR\u2299 )/hR ) exp(\u2212Z/hZ ), where Z = |Z\u2299 + d sin(b)| is the\nheight above the Galactic plane, Z\u2299 = +27 pc is the height\nof the Sun above the plane, d is the heliocentric distance, b\nis the Galactic latitude, hZ = 270 pc is the scale height, R\nis galactocentric distance, hR = 2 250 pc is the scale length\nand N0 is the space density in the plane (Z = 0) at the solar\ngalactocentric distance of R\u2299 = 8 600 pc (Chen et al. 2001).\nThe intrinsic I-band magnitudes of stars with spectral\ntypes from A0 to M9 were compiled from several sources\nin the literature (Bessell & Brett 1988; Gray 1992; Leggett\n1992; Leggett et al. 1996) while average colours were derived\nfor the HST filters in a Section 3.1.2. We then populated a\ncone of length 7 200 pc in the direction of NGC 6611 according to the density behaviour described above, selecting stars\nrandomly from the list previously generated. The opening\nangle of the cone simulates an area ten times larger than\n\n9\n\nour real survey area to ensure that the contamination correction plays no role in the statistical uncertainties of the\nIMF.\nThe next step is to describe the extinction profile towards and behind NGC 6611. Belikov et al. (1999) shows\nthat the reddening distribution of field stars towards the\ncluster has two peaks, one identified as a low-extinction foreground population and a second identified as a reddened\nbackground population obscured by the molecular cloud.\nThe E(B \u2212 V ) values measured towards both the massive\ncluster members and PMS stars seem to show a real spread\nin extinction. This suggests a first extinction screen associated with the cluster's parent molecular cloud. The analysis\nin Section 3.1.1 strongly suggests that there is a second extinction screen behind the cluster, probably associated with\nanother spiral arm structure.\nWe take all this information into account to construct a\nprescription for the behaviour of extinction as a function of\ndistance along the line-of-sight towards NGC 6611. We assumed that E(B \u2212 V ) has a double-step-like behaviour: it\ngrows linearly with distance at the rate of 0.25 mag kpc\u22121 ,\nreaching AV = 1.7 mag at the cluster position and then immediately increasing to AV = 3.7 mag (in agreement with\nmeasurements towards cluster members). Behind the cluster, extinction continues to increase at 0.25 mag kpc\u22121 until\nthe position of the second extinction screen. At a distance of\n2 500 pc extinction climbs to AV \u223c13 mag, consistent with\nthe 2MASS extinction profile from Marshall et al. (2006).\nAfter that, extinction increases linearly to a maximum simulated distance of 7 200 pc. We adopt RV = 3.75 mag up to\nand including the cluster position (the extinction behaviour\nis dominated by the average dust properties in the molecular cloud), while behind the cluster we adopt RV = 3.1,\nmore consistent with the average properties of the Galactic\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Each star in the simulation has\nextinction applied to its magnitudes according to its simulated distance and following this two-step function. Finally,\nthe simulated apparent magnitudes are perturbed according to the observed distribution of measurement errors in\nthe photometric catalogue.\nFig. 7 shows a colour-magnitude diagram: filled and\nopen circles represent the observed and simulated catalogues respectively. The simulated catalogue seems to successfully reproduce the observed colour-colour and colourmagnitude diagrams in terms of the different stellar populations present: the foreground population, the moderate\nextinction background population and the heavily reddened\npopulation at larger distance behind the cluster. To test\nwhether the simulated catalogue also quantitatively produces the correct numbers of stars we investigated in more\ndetail two particular regions in the IZ diagram: just below\nthe PMS selection area and the region where the clump of\nstars with redder colours are observed. The comparison of\nthe numbers of simulated and observed stars in colour bins\nis also shown in Fig. 7. For these two representative regions,\nthe simulated catalogue produces stellar numbers that are\nentirely consistent with the observed catalogue.\nHowever, the simulated catalogue does not produce\nstars with more extreme red colours (I \u2212 Z > 2.8 mag).\nThere are several possible reasons for this. The properties\nof the very reddened population are sensitive to the details\nof the extinction profile in the simulation, such as the lo-\n\n\f10\n\nFigure 7. Colour-magnitude diagram of the simulated and observed catalogues (open and filled circles respectively). Coloured\nsymbols are the objects used for the comparison between the observed and simulated catalogues (respectively blue and red symbols). The bottom panel shows the I \u2212 Z colour histograms for\ntwo areas in the colour-magnitude diagram (dashed boxes): below the PMS selection region and at the location of the reddened\nstar population. The simulated area is ten times larger than the\nHST field; the histogram has been renormalised to equal area. In\nterms of the number of objects in each colour bin the simulated\n(red histogram) and observed (blue histogram) catalogues agree\nvery well. The simulation does not however produce objects redder than about I \u2212Z \u223c 2.8 mag (see text). Simulated objects that\nfall into the PMS selection region are potential contaminants, but\nare largely excluded on the basis of their reddening (see text).\n\ncation and magnitude of the second extinction jump, the\nfact that we do not account for any structure or clumpiness\nin the ISM and the adopted reddening coefficients. And at\nlarge extinctions, these coefficients are manifestly not constant and they also depend on the intrinsic colours of each\nobject. Furthermore, we only simulate main-sequence ob-\n\njects; this reddened population has evolved stars associated\nwith it, brighter and redder objects that we simply do not\nsimulate. The properties of the first extinction jump affect\nonly the population underneath the PMS selection region.\nAnother source of uncertainty is the parameters associated\nwith the Galactic stellar density distribution, particularly\nhR (Chen et al. 2001).\nIn spite of all these caveats, our simulation is able to reproduce the observed catalogue quite well. Fig. 7 shows that\nthe number of possible contaminants (i.e. simulated objects\nthat fall into the PMS selection region) is very small, even for\nsuch a deep survey. The heavily extincted background population is effectively removed by the J \u2212H colour cut for PMS\nselection (Fig. 2). By using reddening cuts (see Section 3.1.2)\nwe are further able to exclude the majority of possible contaminants from the foreground and moderately extincted\nbackground populations. The application of the reddening\ncuts also means that the exact details of the extinction behind the cluster are not crucial; as the area considered here\nis small, the number of foreground contaminants is so small\nthat foreground extinction is also not an issue. However,\nsome objects from the former population can have similar\nextinction as the young cluster, and thus contaminate the\nPMS selection region. These contaminants need to be taken\ninto account when constructing the mass function.\nThe procedure described here to mimic field star contamination produces a catalogue that is processed in exactly\nthe same way as the observed stellar catalogue. A PMS and\nreddening selection is performed on the simulated catalogue:\nthere are only 52 simulated contaminants in the PMS selection region and of these only 17 or 14 fulfil the reddening\nrequirements (respectively using the 2 or 3 Myr isochrones).\nFor these objects, intrinsic I-band magnitudes and stellar\nmasses are estimated. The derived masses are used to compute a contamination mass function (MF). This MF is divided by 10 because the simulated area is ten times larger\nthan our actual survey. We find that there are less than 2\ncontaminants in the two lower mass bins. Even though contamination is low, we choose not to neglect it as it affects\nthe more crucial lower-mass bins. The contamination MF is\nsubtracted from the completeness-corrected IMF computed\nin the previous section (Section 4.1).\nWe consider other potential sources of contamination.\nNearby giants are very bright and thus are saturated in the\nHST images. Giants associated with the heavily extincted\npopulation described above are not simulated. However, as it\ncan be seen in Fig. 2, they are redder than J \u2212H \u223c 2 mag and\nthus do not contaminate the PMS selection region. Evolved\nstars between the cluster and this redder population could\nin principle contaminate the PMS selection; they are however in negligible numbers due to the low stellar density and\nthe small volume sampled. The reddening screen behind the\ncluster further precludes giants nearer the Galactic centre\nas well as bright galaxies from being PMS contaminants, by\nmaking these extremely red and faint.\n3.2\n\nHigher and solar-mass stars\n\nWe selected from the IZJH catalogue of Oliveira et al.\n(2005) a subset of stars from the same area in the sky as\nthe NICMOS mosaic in Fig. 1.

Based on criteria described above, 150 stars are identified as PMS candidates in the area covered by the NICMOS mosaic (Table 2, complete in electronic form only).\n\nIdentification of PMS stars and membership\nselection\n\nAs for the HST photometry, we follow criteria based on I\nmagnitude, I \u2212 Z and I \u2212 J colours to select PMS objects\nfrom the groundbased photometry (Fig. 8). J \u2212 H does not\nplay a role in the PMS selection here as there is negligible contamination from red stars in this magnitude range.\nThe foreground field star sequence is scarcely populated in\nsuch a small area, indicating that contamination at brighter\nmagnitudes is also very low. To increase the contrast of the\nfield and PMS sequences, the diagrams also show the popula-\n\n3.2.2\n\nReddening determination of PMS stars\n\nNo single set of isochrones covers the complete mass range\ncovered by our HST and groundbased catalogues. For the\nmagnitude range covered in the Oliveira et al. (2005) catalogue, the most appropriate set of isochrones are those of\nSiess, Dufour & Forestini (2000) for solar metallicity that\ncover the mass range 0.1 \u2212 7 M\u2299 . This isochrone grid provides magnitudes calibrated according to the conversion table from Kenyon & Hartmann (1995). Those magnitudes are\n\n\f12\nconverted to the appropriate photometric system using published transformations: isochronal IR magnitudes were first\nconverted to the 2MASS photometric system (Carpenter\n2001) and then to the MKO system (Tokunaga et al. 2002);\nI-band magnitudes need no conversion.\nWe could have used the Siess isochrones and the IJH\ncolour-magnitude diagram to determine the extinction towards the PMS candidates (theoretical Z magnitudes are\nnot available), similar to what was described in Section. 3.1.2\nfor the HST catalogue. However, and as expected for a\nbrighter sample dominated by earlier type stars, the range of\ncolours exhibited by these stars means that a large fraction\nof objects have a double reddening solution (see Sect. 3.1.2).\nIn this regime, even small photometric errors can cause large\nuncertainties in E(B \u2212 V ). Furthermore, we think there\nare unquantified systematic effects in the isochronal J and\nH magnitudes due to successive photometric transformation. Taking all these factors into account, we consider this\nmethod to derive reddening rather unreliable for this particular sample and therefore chose to adopt a constant reddening E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.7 mag (see Sect. 3.1.2). Using this extinction value, intrinsic magnitudes are computed. Assuming an age of either 2 or 3 Myr and a distance of 1.8 kpc,\nwe compute a stellar mass for each object using their intrinsic I-band magnitudes and the Siess et al. (2000) isochrones\n(Table 2).5\n\n3.2.3\n\nCompleteness correction and field star\ncontamination\n\nDue to severe crowding towards the cluster centre and the\nrelatively large number of saturated stars in the images, the\ngroundbased data of this region are incomplete. To compute\nthe completeness correction for the groundbased I-band catalogue we make use of the much deeper HST J and H catalogues. The I-band HST catalogue cannot be used in this\nway because it saturates at I \u223c 16 mag, corresponding (very\napproximately) to I \u223c 15.7 mag in the groundbased catalogue. The procedure is rather simple. We start by assuming\nthat the HST J and H catalogues are essentially complete.\nThis is a reasonable assumption over most of the magnitude range of interest here, as incompleteness in the IZJH\nHST catalogue is driven by the I- and Z-bands. The J-band\nHST catalogue saturates however at about J \u223c 14 mag (very\napproximately J \u223c 13.5 mag groundbased) thus we are unable to study completeness at the very bright end. We use\nobjects detected in both J and H and look for their positional counterparts in the groundbased IZJH catalogue.\nThis allows us to compute the recovery rate as a function of\nHST J-band magnitude. We need however an I-band completeness function. Using an empirical linear approximation\nHST J-band magnitudes can be converted to MKO J-band\nmagnitudes. And assuming a PMS age (Siess isochrone) the\nJ-band magnitudes correspond uniquely to a groundbased\nI-band magnitude. The resulting I-band completeness function for the groundbased catalogue has a similar shape to\nthe HST I-band completeness function shown in Fig. 6 but\n5\n\nOliveira et al. (2005) adopted a distance of 2 kpc, AV = 3.4 mag\n(E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.9 mag) and an age of 3 Myr. These values are\ndifferent from those adopted here so estimated masses will differ.\n\nFigure 9. Completeness and contamination corrections to be applied to the computed IMFs, for the HST (solid line) and groundbased (dashed line) catalogues. The histograms show mass functions (in black), corrected for incompleteness (red) and contamination (blue) for the HST catalogue only (see text). Contamination is small throughout, even in the brown dwarf mass bins.\nThese histograms refer to the 2 Myr calculations, similar ones\nwere constructed using 3 Myr isochrones.\n\nshifted to brighter magnitudes: it has a value just below\nunity to about I \u223c 15 mag, falling after that as a second\ndegree polynomial to a value of about 0.1 at I \u223c 19 mag.\nTo construct the IMF, each PMS candidate is ascribed a\nweight equal to the inverse of the completeness correction\nat its observed I-band magnitude.\nField star contamination in the magnitude range of interest here is very small. Oliveira et al. (2005) used IZ photometry of an offset field to estimate foreground contamination. Following the same procedure, we estimate that\n\u223c 2 objects might be field star contaminants in the NICMOS mosaic area in this magnitude range; this is an upper\nlimit as we use only IZ criteria (no offset JH photometry\nis available). Such low level of contamination is consistent\nwith what we found for the HST catalogue (Section 3.1.4).\nWe chose not to apply any contamination correction to this\ndata set, as we have no constraints on the likely masses of\npossible contaminants.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nTHE INITIAL MASS FUNCTION OF\nNGC 6611\nConstructing the cluster IMF\n\nIn the previous section, we identified PMS candidates in\nNGC 6611 and computed their intrinsic I-band magnitudes.\nUsing isochrones from Baraffe et al. (1998) and Siess et al.\n(2000) (respectively for the HST and groundbased datasets)\nwe computed masses assuming a distance of 1.8 kpc and using either 2 or 3 Myr isochrones (Tables 1 and 2). We also\nestimate the contributions from completeness and contami-\n\n\fThe low-mass IMF in NGC 6611\n\n13\n\nFigure 10. IMFs derived assuming an isochronal ages of 2 Myr (left) and 3 Myr (right). IMFs were constructed independently using\nthe HST (blue) and groundbased (red) catalogues. The extreme bins in each histogram should be disregarded because they are not\ncompletely sampled by the catalogues. The two contributions agree remarkably well. The choice of isochrones also does not seem to\ninfluence the derived IMF in any significant way.\n\nnation. Fig. 9 illustrates the corrections that are applied to\nthe observed IMF to account for these two effects (in this\nparticular case for the 2 Myr set of calculations). Firstly, histograms are constructed for the PMS masses (bins of 0.3 dex\nin log mass): with unity weights (black histograms) and with\nweights equal to the inverse of the completeness function\n(red histograms) to perform the completeness correction. As\ndescribed in Sect. 3.1.4, a contamination mass histogram is\ncomputed and is then subtracted from the completenesscorrected histogram (blue line). The contamination level is\nlow throughout; in the two lower mass bins there are respectively \u223c 0.2 and \u223c 1.2\u22121.5 contaminants (less than 10%\ncontamination). The final histograms (i.e. with completeness and contamination corrections applied) are the IMFs\nto be discussed in the following paragraphs. We apply no\ncorrection to account for unresolved binaries. The bin size\nof 0.3 dex was chosen to match other published IMFs (Section 4.3); however we tested that this choice does not significantly change the measured properties of the IMF. The\nextreme bins in each histogram should be ignored because\nthe catalogues do not fully sample the mass range in those\nbins.\nThe groundbased and HST samples overlap in\nthe mass range 0.15\u22121.5 M\u2299 . The resulting IMFs\nare shown in Fig. 10 (log N versus log M/M\u2299 ), assuming an age of 2 or 3 Myr. There is a very good\nagreement between the derived IMFs, for the bins\nwhere they overlap, despite different datasets and\nphotometric systems, reddening treatments, theoretical models etc. For these two mass bins we average the two contributions to obtain the final IMFs.\nFig. 10 also shows that the choice of isochronal age does\nnot make a significant difference in the constructed IMF\nproperties. The most noticeable difference is the somewhat\nsharper fall towards higher masses for the 3 Myr determina-\n\ntion. However, the two histograms are consistent within the\nstatistical errors and furthermore these higher mass bins are\naffected by low-number statistics and sampling effects. As\nthe two IMFs are indistinguishable, we settle on the 2 Myr\nrepresentation for further analysis and only when relevant\nprovide comments using the 3 Myr-derived IMF.\nWe find that the IMF in NGC 6611 rises Salpeter-like at\nhigher masses, consistent with many determinations available in the literature (e.g., Dufton et al. 2006). The IMF\nflattens out between \u223c 1.25 and 0.3 M\u2299 (with the most likely\npeak position between 0.3 and 0.6 M\u2299 ) and then drops into\nthe brown dwarf regime. There is an apparent secondary\npeak at \u223c 0.05 M\u2299 . However, as we disregard the lower mass\nbin, there is no evidence for a steep decline in the IMF towards lower masses.\nWe identified 30\u221235 brown dwarfs (respectively assuming 3 or 2 Myr) in our observed sample (before any completeness correction was applied, see Table 1). The brown dwarf\nto star ratio, defined as the ratio of the number of stars\nwith masses in the ranges 0.02\u22120.08 M\u2299 and 0.08\u221210. M\u2299\n(Brice\u00f1o et al. 2002), is 0.19 \u00b1 0.03 (0.17 \u00b1 0.03 for 3 Myr).\nThe star to brown dwarf ratio, defined by Andersen et al.\n(2008) as the ratio of the number of stars with masses in the\n+1.2\nranges 0.08\u22121. M\u2299 and 0.03\u22120.08 M\u2299 is 4.4+0.9\n\u22120.6 (5.3\u22120.8 for\n3 Myr). In the next subsections we will compare these observed properties both with theoretical IMF representations\nand with other young clusters.\n4.2\n\nComparison with IMF theoretical\nexpectations\n\nThe most commonly used theoretical representations of the\nfield IMF make use of a multiple-part power-law (e.g.,\nKroupa 2001) or a Scalo-like log-normal function (e.g.,\nChabrier 2005). Both functional forms describe the IMF as\n\n\f14\nthe width of the distributions is similar in NGC 6611 and\nin the field, the peak occurs at higher masses in NGC 6611.\nBoth the comparison with the power-law and log-normal\nIMFs suggests that the IMF in NGC 6611 peaks at higher\nmass.\n\n4.3\n\nFigure 11. Comparison of the IMF of NGC 6611 with well known\ntheoretical functional forms: the multiple-part power-law IMF (labelled blue line, Kroupa 2001) and the log-normal IMF (labelled\nred line, Chabrier 2005). We have fitted such functions to the\nobserved IMF (ignoring the two extreme bins); the most adequate fits are overplotted on the IMF. Both when compared to\nthe power-law and log-normal formulations, the NGC 6611 IMF\npeaks at a slightly higher mass, \u223c 0.45 M\u2299 (see text).\n\nreaching a peak at a few tenths of a solar mass and falling\nboth into the higher-mass and brown dwarf regimes. The\nKroupa (2001) power-law IMF (in linear units) is characterised by the index \u03b1 and is defined as \u03c8(M ) = dN/dM \u221d\nM \u2212\u03b1i . The average Galactic-field IMF (uncorrected for unresolved binaries) is Salpeter-like to 0.5 M\u2299 with \u03b11 \u223c +2.3\n- in this representation the Salpeter slope is equal to +2.35;\nbetween 0.08 and 0.5 M\u2299 , the IMF flattens somewhat, continuing to rise but less steeply with \u03b12 \u223c +1.3; the IMF\ndrops into the brown dwarf regime with \u03b13 \u223c +0.3 (Kroupa\n2001). The log-normal description (in logarithmic units) has\nthe form \u03be = dN/d log M \u221d exp(\u2212(log m \u2212 log mc )2 /2\u03c3 2 ).\nChabrier (2005) find that mc = 0.25 M\u2299 and \u03c3 = 0.55 are\nrequired to reproduce the stellar MF in the solar neighbourhood (no correction for unresolved binaries). This lognormal distribution is also found to fit well the MFs of a\nnumber of open clusters like Blanco 1 (Moraux et al. 2007)\nand the Pleiades (Moraux et al. 2003).\nIn Fig. 11 we compare the IMF of NGC 6611 with both\nthe power-law and log-normal IMFs. We stress that we\nhave applied no correction to account for unresolved binary\nsystems. In terms of a power-law representation, we find\nthat the best fits are provided by power-law indices \u03b1i of\n+2.36, +1.18 and +0.52, respectively for masses & 0.9 M\u2299 ,\nbetween \u223c 0.9 and \u223c 0.45 M\u2299 and . 0.45 M\u2299 . These indices are consistent with those determined by Kroupa (2001)\nwithin the uncertainties. However, the IMF in NGC 6611\nflattens at higher masses (\u223c 0.9 M\u2299 instead of 0.5 M\u2299 ) and\nstarts to fall sharply also at higher masses (\u223c 0.45 M\u2299 instead of 0.1 M\u2299 ). When using the log-normal function we\ndetermine mc \u223c 0.40 \u00b1 0.04 M\u2299 and \u03c3 = 0.56 \u00b1 0.04. While\n\nComparison with other young clusters\n\nIn this section we compare the IMF of NGC 6611 with those\nof other young clusters and associations compiled from the\nliterature: Taurus (Luhman 2004), the ONC (Muench et al.\n2002; Slesnick et al. 2004), IC 348 (Luhman et al. 2003),\nChamaeleon I (Luhman 2007) and NGC 2024 (Levine et al.\n2006). Slesnick et al. (2004) constructed the IMF for the\nONC using the D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997) evolutionary\ntracks; for the remaining determinations the Baraffe et al.\n(1998) models were used. These clusters are younger than\na few Myrs in order to minimise effects like dynamical evolution and mass segregation. No correction for binarity\nwas applied to the IMFs of any of the clusters discussed here, assuring that these IMFs are comparable, so long as their binary properties are not too\ndifferent.6\nIn Fig. 12 we show the IMFs of the clusters considered\nhere. A noticeable difference is that the IMFs of both Taurus\nand NGC 6611 (Fig. 12, left) seem to peak at slightly higher\nmasses than those of the other young clusters (Fig. 12, right):\nthe IMF peaks are at \u223c 0.8 M\u2299 and \u223c 0.5 M\u2299 , respectively\nfor Taurus and NGC 6611 and at 0.1 \u2212 0.2 M\u2299 for the other\nclusters. Another quantity also used to characterise the IMF\n- and that might be less dependent on the adopted binning\n- is the characteristic mass, defined as the mid-point of the\nIMF plateau (Elmegreen et al. 2008); for most clusters in\nFig. 12 it occurs at \u223c 0.3 M\u2299 while for NGC 6611 it is at\n\u223c 0.45 M\u2299 .\nWe perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical comparison to test whether the observed IMF differences are significant. When the IMF of NGC 6611 is compared to those of\nTaurus and the ONC, the probability that they are drawn\nfor the same cumulative distribution is 0.1 and 4 \u00d7 10\u22126 ,\nrespectively. The probability that the IMFs of the ONC and\nIC 348 are drawn from the same distribution is 0.65, confirming that indeed they are very similar. This analysis confirms\nthat the shape of the IMF of NGC 6611 more resembles that\nof Taurus and it is very unlikely to mirror that of the ONC.\nWe can also compare the relative numbers of stars and\nbrown dwarfs for these clusters. We should point out that\nsuch ratios are problematic to compute as it is difficult to\nachieve survey completeness: for instance Taurus is a very\nspatially extended region and Cambr\u00e9sy et al. (2006) claim\nthat current IC 348 surveys are still incomplete. We list\navailable ratios for the 6 clusters in Table 3. The brown dwarf\nto star ratio varies from 0.13 for IC 348 to 0.30 for the ONC\nand NGC 2024. The brown dwarf to star ratios of the ONC,\nNGC 2024 and Chamaeleon I are similar within the uncertainties while those for Taurus and IC 348 are lower. The\n6\n\nChabrier (2005) has shown that when unresolved binaries are taken into account the peak of the disc\nIMF moves to slightly lower masses (from 0.25 M\u2299 to\n0.20 M\u2299 ).\n\n\fThe low-mass IMF in NGC 6611\n\n15\n\nFigure 12. Comparison between IMFs for several young clusters and associations: NGC 6611 (this work, red), Taurus (Luhman 2004,\ngreen), the ONC (Muench et al. 2002, orange solid line, rebinned to match other clusters; Slesnick et al. 2004, orange dashed line),\nIC 348 (Luhman et al. 2003, cyan), Chamaeleon I (Luhman 2007, blue) and NGC 2024 (Levine et al. 2006, magenta). The y-axis is\nin arbitrary log N units and published cluster IMFs have been renormalised for display purposes. The vertical dotted lines indicate the\ntypical positions of the plateau and the characteristic mass Mc for most clusters. The peaks of the IMFs of Taurus and NGC 6611 seem\nto occur at higher masses.\n\nratio we determine for NGC 6611 is consistent with that of\nTaurus. The ratio of stars to brown dwarfs (as defined by\nAndersen et al. 2008) varies from 3.3+0.8\n\u22120.7 for the ONC to\n8.3+3.3\n\u22122.6 for IC 348. The ratio for NGC 6611 is between those\nfor Chamaeleon I and Taurus.\nAn issue still being debated is whether the shape of the\nIMF shows any imprint of the conditions under which the\nstar formation process takes place. Those initial conditions\nare impossible to constrain directly, but we can try to infer\nthem from the observed present-day properties of the resulting stellar populations. We use cluster data available in the\nliterature (Andersen et al. 2008, and references therein) to\ncrudely estimate an average stellar surface density of PMS\nstars (dividing the number of stars with masses in the range\n0.03\u22121M\u2299 by the area) for each cluster. We also estimate\nthe average ionising flux at the position of the PMS stars\nfor NGC 6611 and the ONC - using tabulated total ionising\nfluxes from Osterbrock & Ferland (2006); the other populations contain no O-stars. These and other relevant cluster\nproperties are listed in Table 3.\nThe ONC is the most extreme of these associations\nin terms of present day stellar density. Chamaeleon I,\nNGC 2024 and IC 348 all have similar stellar densities and\nare less dense than NGC 6611 and the ONC. Taurus on the\nother hand is the prototypical example of a low density\nquiescent star forming environment. The average ionising\nfluxes for NGC 6611 and the ONC are similar, despite the\nfact that NGC 6611 has more and more powerful ionising\nsources. NGC 6611 is the most massive of the clusters considered here (Bonatto et al. 2006).\nThe IMFs of the ONC, Chamaeleon I and IC 348 are\nsimilar, despite their different stellar densities; although\ncompared to these other clusters IC 348 has an abnormally\n\nlow number of brown dwarfs. The IMF of NGC 6611 most\nresembles that of Taurus, both in terms of peak mass and\nrelative number of brown dwarfs, but the star formation environments of NGC 6611 and Taurus are dramatically different. The IMFs of NGC 6611 and the ONC are very different,\ndespite both being examples of low-mass star formation accompanied by O- and B-type stars.\nThe properties described in the Table 3 are present day\ncluster properties and the ages of the clusters span 1 \u2212 3 Myr.\nSome dynamical evolution has probably occurred so the populations were likely denser and, in the cases of NGC 6611 and\nthe ONC, the PMS stars were likely nearer to the ionising\nsources. We only analyse a small central region of NGC 6611\nand it is not possible to assess at the moment whether the\nIMF we constructed is representative of the whole cluster.\nStill, no clear trend has emerged so far that relates IMF observed properties with known cluster properties like ionising\nradiation or stellar density. Our results suggest that the radiation field from the O-stars does not play a dominant role\nin shaping the lower-mass IMF.\n\n4.4\n\nDiscussion and implications\n\nThe goal of this paper was to investigate the properties of\nthe low-mass IMF of NGC 6611, and in particular the brown\ndwarf frequency and peak or characteristic mass. The intrinsic complexity of the IMF and the still limited understanding\nof which processes are dominant in shaping it (Bonnell et al.\n2007; Elmegreen 2008) means that it is not possible to model\nan individual IMF (except by using analytic parameterisations like the ones described in Section 4.2). Instead by comparing the IMFs of clusters and associations with different\npresent-day properties we can try to constrain which phys-\n\n\f16\nTable 3.

These theories need to be able to\nexplain not only the properties of the IMF, but the binary\nand circumstellar disc fractions across all masses and the\ndynamical properties of stellar populations.\nThere is abundant observational evidence that supports a similar formation mechanism for brown dwarfs\nand solar-mass stars (Luhman et al. 2006). However, an\nopen question in the understanding of brown dwarf (and\nlow-mass star) formation is how the low-mass cores are\nstopped from accreting further so that their final mass can\nremain sub-stellar. Two mechanisms have been proposed\nto halt accretion: ejection of newly formed fragments and\nphoto-evaporation of collapsing cores. The ejection scenario\n(e.g., Reipurth & Clarke 2001) proposes that the smallest\nclumps in multiple systems are ejected and are thus denied access to the molecular gas reservoir. There are several problems with this scenario, namely that the spatial distribution of solar-mass stars and brown dwarfs in\nclusters seems to be similar (Luhman 2004; Luhman et al.\n2006), and that both the binary (Burgasser et al. 2007) and\ndisc properties (Jayawardhana et al. 2003) of the two populations are also similar. The photo-evaporation scenario\n(Whitworth & Zinnecker 2004) relies on the proximity to\nmassive O-stars to stop accretion. This would imply that\nwe should find a higher brown dwarf to star ratio in OB associations than in quieter regions; this is not supported by\nour observations in NGC 6611.\nRecently Bonnell et al. (2008) suggested that gravitational fragmentation of infalling gas into stellar clusters can\nform low-mass stars and brown dwarfs without invoking any\nadditional mechanism. Increased gas density within the collapse region gives rise to a filamentary-like structure within\nwhich the Jeans mass is lower, allowing lower-mass clumps\nto form; the infall velocity of the gas prevents the low-mass\nclump from accreting significant amounts of gas, preserving\n\nits low-mass or brown dwarf status. Another mechanism like\nturbulent fragmentation would however be necessary to form\nbrown dwarfs in low-density regions (Bonnell et al. 2008).\nAs discussed in the previous section, the observations do not\nsuggest any variation of brown dwarf fraction with present\nday average stellar density.\nThe fact that massive star feedback does not seem\nto have a significant impact on low mass star formation is not necessarily surprising. The idea that competitive accretion in a cluster environment is an important\nprocess in the formation of the more massive stars is\ngaining favour (Bonnell & Bate 2006; Bonnell et al. 2007;\nElmegreen 2008). In this context, fragmentation produces\nlower-mass stars and a few higher-mass stars form subsequently by accreting more mass in the cluster gravitational\npotential. This would imply that by the time the most massive stars are formed, the main properties of the IMF are\nalready defined (Bonnell & Bate 2006; Bonnell et al. 2007);\nwe would then not expect significant differences between the\nIMFs of OB associations and quiet star forming regions, consistent with what was shown in Section 4.3.\nThe shape of the IMF between 0.1 and 1 M\u2299 also\npresents a challenge. The characteristic mass of the IMF\nMc is observed to be essentially constant for most star forming regions (see review by Elmegreen et al. 2008). Based on\nnumerical simulations it has been proposed that this characteristic mass (and the associated plateau) is related to\nthe thermal Jeans mass at the onset of (isothermal) collapse (e.g., Bate & Bonnell 2005). One could then intuitively\nexpect the plateau properties to vary with the environmental conditions, via for instance the dependence of the\nJeans mass on the density in the molecular core. However,\nElmegreen et al. (2008) show that, if grain-gas coupling is\ntaken into account, the thermal Jeans mass depends only\nweakly on environmental factors like density, temperature,\nmetallicity and radiation field. Indeed, recent simulations by\nBonnell, Clarke & Bate (2006), using a more realistic equation of state to allow for the coupling of the gas and dust\nat the high densities typical of star forming regions, predict\na characteristic mass that is relatively independent of the\ninitial conditions for star formation.\n\n\fThe low-mass IMF in NGC 6611\nFig. 12 shows some significant differences in the observed IMFs of young clusters. At the present, and in the\nabsence of any trend of IMF properties with cluster properties, we remain unable to explain such differences. It is possible that the lower-mass IMF is shaped by a combination of\ndifferent processes and that a particular effect might become\ndominant depending on the environmental conditions.\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe present results based on the deepest images to date in the\ncentral region of NGC 6611. The observations were obtained\nwith ACS/WFC and NICMOS on board HST and reach\ndown to I \u223c 26 mag. We use this photometric catalogue\nto construct the cluster IMF from 1.5 M\u2299 to 0.02 M\u2299 . We\nuse the photometric catalogue from Oliveira et al. (2005) to\nextend this IMF to higher masses (\u223c 7 M\u2299 ).\nWe find that the IMF of NGC 6611 is well described by\na log-normal distribution. However, both when compared to\nthe Kroupa (2001) multiple power-law and Chabrier (2005)\nlog-normal distributions, the IMF of NGC 6611 seems to\npeak at higher masses than the Galactic field and the solar\nneighbourhood IMF. The higher-mass slope is Salpeter-like\nand we find no evidence of a sharp decline towards the brown\ndwarf regime. We identified 30 \u2212 35 brown dwarf candidates,\ndepending on the assumed cluster age.\nWe compare the IMF we derive for NGC 6611 to those of\nother clusters available in the literature. We find conclusive\nevidence that the IMF of NGC 6611 more closely resembles\nthat of Taurus than that of the ONC. This is surprising\nsince Taurus is the prototypical low-density star-forming region while both NGC 6611 and the ONC are examples of\nlow-mass star formation in OB associations. Even though\nthe present day properties of these two clusters (stellar density and ionising radiation field) are similar, a K-S test shows\nthat their observed IMFs are not drawn from the same mass\ndistribution. Our analysis yields no trend that relates either\npresent-day stellar density or intensity of the ionisation field\nwith observed IMF properties. Still, the fact that the IMFs\nof Taurus and NGC 6611 are similar suggests that the formation of lower-mass stars can be unaffected by their massive\nsiblings.\nEven though there is mounting evidence that suggests\nvariations in the lower-mass IMF for young clusters, we are\nstill at present unable to fully explain them. A large sample of clusters, observed and analysed consistently, is necessary to try to investigate environmental links in any detail.\nNew instrumentation is already allowing us to investigate\nthe lower-mass IMFs in extragalactic environments. In that\ncontext IMFs constructed solely on the basis of photometric\ncatalogues will become increasingly important, as they offer\nthe only reliable comparisons with extragalactic determinations.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the STScI Help Desk for invaluable support in preparing and reducing the observations.\nSTSDAS and PyRAF are products of the Space Telescope\nScience Institute, which is operated by AURA for NASA.\n\n17\n\nThe authors also acknowledge the support of the UKIRT and\nINT staff.
