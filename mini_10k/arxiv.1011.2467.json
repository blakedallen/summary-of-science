We present recent progress in the calculation of the helium fine-structure splitting\nof the 23 PJ states, based on the quantum electrodynamic theory. Apart from the complete\nevaluation of m \u03b17 and m2 /M \u03b16 corrections, we have performed extensive tests by comparison\nwith all experimental results for light helium-like ions and with the known large nuclear charge\nasymptotics of individual corrections.

This means that the spectroscopic determination of \u03b1 can\nbe significantly improved if another measurement of the 23 P0 \u2212 23 P2 transition in helium-like\nLi+ or Be2+ ion is performed.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe quantum electrodynamic (QED) theory of atomic energy levels has achieved a precision\nlevel that makes possible the determination of nuclear properties, like the charge radius, the\nmagnetic dipole, or even the nuclear polarizability from measured atomic spectra. If the nuclear\nstructure effects are negligible or can be eliminated, one may obtain fundamental constants\nfrom comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental results. The most important\nexamples include the Rydberg constant determined from hydrogen spectroscopy, the electron\nmass derived from the bound-electron g factor in hydrogen-like ions, and \u03b1 obtained from the\nhelium fine structure. As first pointed out by Schwartz in 1964 [1], the splitting of the 23 PJ\nlevels in helium can be used for an accurate determination of the fine structure constant \u03b1. The\nattractive features of the fine structure in helium as compared to other atomic transitions are,\nfirst, the long lifetime of the metastable 23 PJ levels (roughly two orders of magnitude longer than\nthat of the 2p state in hydrogen) and, second, the relative simplicity of the theory. Schwartz's\nsuggestion stimulated a sequence of calculations [2\u20135], which resulted in a theoretical description\nof the helium fine structure complete up to order m\u03b16 (or \u03b14 Ry) and a value of \u03b1 accurate to\n0.9 ppm [6].\nThe present experimental precision for the fine-structure intervals in helium is sufficient for\na determination of \u03b1 with an accuracy of 14 ppb from Refs. [7, 8] and even 5 ppb from Ref. [9].\n\n\fIn order to match this level of accuracy in the theoretical description of the fine structure, the\ncomplete calculation of the next-order, m\u03b17 contribution and an estimation of the higher-order\neffects is needed. Work towards this end started in the 1990s and extended over two decades\n[10\u201319]. In 2006 the first complete evaluation of the m\u03b17 correction to the helium fine structure\nwas reported by one of us (KP) [20]. However, the numerical results presented there were in\ndisagreement with the experimental values by more than 10 standard deviations (\u03c3).\nIn our recent investigations [21, 22], we recalculated, using formulae from Ref. [20], all effects\nup to order m\u03b17 to the fine structure of helium and performed calculations for helium-like ions\nwith nuclear charges Z up to 10. The calculations were extensively checked by studying the\nhydrogenic (Z \u2192 \u221e) limit of individual corrections and by comparing them with the results\nknown from the hydrogen theory. We found several problems in previous numerical calculations\nand, in the meantime, the experimental value of the 23 P1 \u2212 23 P2 transition was changed by 3\u03c3\n[8]. As a result, the present theoretical predictions are in agreement with the latest experimental\ndata for the fine-structure intervals in helium, as well as with most of the experimental data\navailable for light helium-like ions. Our calculation of the m\u03b17 correction for the fine-structure\nsplitting in light helium-like atoms was reported in Refs. [22, 23]. In this paper, we present a\ndetailed description of all corrections to helium fine structure and a summary of the numerical\nresults.\n2. QED theory of the helium fine structure\nAccording to the quantum electrodynamic theory (QED) the energy levels of an atomic system\nare a function of the fine structure constant \u03b1 and the electron-nucleus mass ratio. We omit\npossible nuclear structure effects, as their contribution to the helium fine structure is negligible.\nThe fine-structure splitting Efs (\u03b1) can be expanded in powers of \u03b1,\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nEfs = Efs + Efs + Efs + Efs + O(\u03b18 ) .\n\n(1)\n\n(n)\n\nThe expansion terms Efs \u2261 m \u03b1n E (n) are of order m \u03b1n . They implicitly depend on the\nelectron-nucleus mass ratio and may additionally involve powers of ln \u03b1. The advantage of this\napproach is that each of the expansion terms is expressed as the expectation value of some\neffective Hamiltonian, as presented in the following. For convenience, we first consider the\ninfinite nuclear mass limit, and then account for the finite nuclear mass corrections separately.\nThe dominant contribution to the helium fine structure is induced by the spin-dependent\npart of the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian, which is, for an infinitely heavy nucleus,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~\u03c31 * ~r ~\u03c32 * ~r\n1 ~\u03c31 * ~\u03c32\n\u22123\n(1 + ae )2\nHfs =\n4\nr3\nr5\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ 1\n1\n+\n~r1 \u00d7 p~1 * ~\u03c31 + 3 ~r2 \u00d7 p~2 * ~\u03c32 (1 + 2ae )\n4 r13\nr2\n\u001a\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n(1 + 2 ae ) ~\u03c32 + 2 (1 + ae ) ~\u03c31 * ~r \u00d7 p~2\n+\n3\n4r\n\u001b\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212 (1 + 2 ae ) ~\u03c31 + 2 (1 + ae ) ~\u03c32 * ~r \u00d7 p~1 ,\n(2)\n\nwhere ~r = ~r1 \u2212~r2 .

[21]\ncontained contributions of higher orders, whereas in the present work the entries in Table 2\ncontain only the contributions of the order specified.\nA term-by-term comparison with the independent calculation by Drake [18] was performed in\nRef. [23]. We observe good agreement between the two calculations for the lower-order terms,\n\n\fTable 2. Summary of individual contributions to the fine-structure intervals in helium, in\nkHz.

[9].\n\nnamely, for the m\u03b14 , m\u03b15 , and m\u03b16 corrections. However, for the recoil correction to order\nm\u03b16 , our results differ from those of Drake by about 0.5 kHz for both intervals. The reason\nfor this disagreement seems to be different for the large and the small intervals. For the large\ninterval, the deviation is due to the recoil operator part, whereas for the small interval, it is\nmainly due to the mass polarization part (see discussion in Ref. [21]).\nOur present estimates of the uncalculated higher-order effects for helium are larger than\nthose in the previous studies [17, 18]. The previous estimates were significantly less than 1 kHz.\nThey were based on logarithmic contributions to order m\u03b18 corresponding to the hydrogen fine\nstructure. However, a larger contribution might originate from the nonlogarithmic relativistic\ncorrections. So our present estimate is obtained by multiplying the m\u03b16 contribution for the\n\u03bd02 = \u03bd01 + \u03bd12 interval by the factor of (Z\u03b1)2 , which yields a conservative estimate of \u00b11.7 kHz\nfor all \u03bd01 , \u03bd12 , and \u03bd02 intervals. All nuclear structure effects are completely negligible at the\ncurrent precision level. The finite nuclear size correction is estimated to yield 18 Hz for \u03bd01 and\n6 Hz for \u03bd12 .\nOur result for the \u03bd01 interval of helium agrees well with all recent experimental values\n[7, 26, 27]. For the \u03bd12 interval, theoretical result is by about 2\u03c3 larger than the values obtained\nin Refs. [7, 28] but in agreement with the latest measurement by Hessels and coworkers [8].\nOur theoretical prediction for the \u03bd02 interval is in excellent agreement with the very recent\nmeasurement of Smiciklas and Shiner [9]. Comparison with this experimental result suggests\nthat the higher-order contribution might in fact be much smaller than our conservative estimate.\nThis means that, if an independent measurement on Li+ or Be2+ confirms the smallness of the\nm\u03b18 terms, the helium determination of \u03b1 will be significantly improved. The measurement\nshould be performed for the 23 P0 \u2212 23 P2 transition, since it is not affected by the singlet-triplet\nmixing effects, which strongly depend on Z.\nIn summary, the theory of the fine structure of helium and light helium-like ions is now\n\n\fcomplete up to orders m\u03b17 and \u03b16 m2 /M . The theoretical predictions agree with the latest\nexperimental results for helium, as well as with most of the experimental data for light heliumlike ions. A combination of the theoretical and experimental results [9] for the 23 P0 \u2212 23 P2\ninterval in helium yields an independent determination of the fine structure constant \u03b1\n\u03b1\u22121 = 137.035 999 55(64)(4)(368) ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the first error is the experimental uncertainty, the second one is the numerical uncertainty,\nand the third comes from the estimate of the m \u03b18 term (\u00b11.7 kHz). The result (26) is accurate\nto 27 ppb and in agreement with the recent value obtained from the electron g factor [29].\nAcknowledgments\nSupport by NIST through Precision Measurement Grant PMG 60NANB7D6153 is gratefully\nacknowledged.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n\nSchwartz C 1964 Phys.
