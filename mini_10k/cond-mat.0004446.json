INTRODUCTION\nThere are several ways for studying friction phenomena. Experimental observations are very powerful to characterize the frictional behaviour and to formulate empirical friction laws, e.g., Coulomb-Amonton's laws [1], from a\nphenomenological point of view. Macroscopically, everybody can usually observe that during two solids are slided\nagainst each other, wear take place. But wear is not necessary for the occurrence of friction. In the last few years the\ntechnological development makes it possible to study wearless dry friction between atomically flat contact interfaces\nexperimentally (nanotribology) [1\u20133]. These nano-scale experiments on systems with less complicity stimulated again\nthe theoretical efforts to investigate friction phenomena on the base of microscopic models [4\u201312]. The dissipative\nnature of friction is a typical non-equilibrium problem. From the theoretical point of view, wearless dry friction between two atomic flat solids could be explained by using a simple driven mechanical many-body system with a lattice\nstructure and take into account interaction forces. Thus the question arises, how the structure of such a microscopic\nmodel of friction has to look.\nOne of the simplest structure on the microscopic level is given by the discrete version of the well-known FrenkelKontorova (FK) model [13], which is in general a model of an one-dimensional harmonic chain of particles in a periodic\npotential. The FK model is mainly used for describing an adsorbate atom monolayer on an atomically flat clean\nsubstrate surface. Using this picture, the driven FK model, where a constant external force is applied to each particle\nof the chain, can also be used as a simple model structure for a wearless friction situation, which has been studied by\nseveral works [4\u20136]. Note, several physical phenomena such as the dislocations motion in crystals [14], commensurateincommensurate transitions [15,16] and charge-density waves (CDW's) [17,18] could also be investigated by reducing\non the FK model structure. Definitely, the simple FK model is a good starting point in order to construct more complex\nand realistic friction models on the atomic level. Thus, a natural extension of the FK model is the replacement of the\nrigid substrat (hard body) by a deformable substrat monolayer pinned on a bulk (soft body). Such a more complex\nmodel of friction was firstly introduced by Matsukawa and Fukuyama [7,8]. They considered an one-dimensional\nmodel consisting of two deformable interacting harmonic chains, where each particle of the lower chain is harmonically\npinned on a rigid bulk. The static and kinetic properties of this two-chain model of friction was analysed in great\ndetails by Kawaguchi and Matsukawa [9,10]. So far, the FK model and the two-chain model are simple models of\nwearless friction between an atomic monolayer and a hard or soft body, respectively. For describing a more realistic\nfriction situation, which should represent wearless friction between atomically flat bodies, it is necessary to replace\nthe adsorbate monolayer by a substrat. For this reason, Weiss and Elmer [11,12] proposed an interesting approach,\nthe so-called Frenkel-Kontorova-Tomlinson (FKT) model, which is an one-dimensional lattice model for a soft upper\nbody sliding on a hard lower body. In contrast to the two-chain model, with the FKT model they extended the FK\nmodel structure in another direction by harmonically coupling of each particle of the adsorbat monolayer on an upper\nmacroscopic sliding mass, whose position relative to the lower surface is characterized by the coordinate xB . Note,\nall of these models are investigated as completely one-dimensional microscopic friction models, where the particles of\nthe one-dimensional chain can only move parallel to the direction of the external force. Now, it is obviously clear,\n1\n\n\fhow you have to extend the previous model structures in order to write down a more complex microscopic model\nsystem, which is necessary to describe friction phenomena as simple but also realistic as possible. For that purpose\nwe introduce an extended two-chain model consisting of two interacting harmonic atomic chains embedded in a twodimensional space, where each particle of the upper or lower chain is harmonically pinned on an upper or a lower\nrigid bulk, respectively. This model describes two soft bodies with an one-dimensional contact interface, which can\ncarry out a genuine two-dimensional sliding motion against each other. In our studies we consider the extended two\nchain model as a simple relaxation model by taking energy dissipation via a phenomenological damping term in the\nmechanical equation of motion into account. Hence, all model, where the energy dissipation is modeled by hand\nthrough an explicit damping term, cannot explain the origin of friction in complex physical systems refering to the\nsliding state. Well, that is also not the aim of our investigations, because with our approach we want to establish the\ntypical macroscopic friction situation (tension experiment) on a microscopic level. Nevertheless, the introduced model\nstructure can be used to discuss the mechanism of the occurrence of static friction, which is one characteristic feature\nof dry friction, based on an energy concept. The hope is that the properties of the ground state - defined as the\nminimal potential energy state of the mechanical model system in absence of an external force - describe completely\nthe static friction behaviour as function of the interaction between the two deformable chains. In general the ground\nstate structure can exhibit two situations as a driven force increased from zero. On the one hand, a zero static friction\narises exactly then if the maximum static friction force vanished, i.e., the model system is frictionless. On the other\nhand, a finite static frition corresponds always with the existence of a finite maximum static friction force, which is\nthe maximum potential energy state of the system above which a sliding state appears. In other words, if we evolve\nthe particle configuration from their ground state configuration, then the maximum static friction force is defined by\nthe largest depinning force, which is equivalent to the smallest driven force above which no stable stationary state\nexists.\nFor the analysis of static properties of the extended two chain model we follow the philosophy of Aubry by using\nstrangely enough an incommensurate ground state structure, which has the only purpose to introduce a special\nkind of mathematical functions called as hull-functions. On the basis of the specific hull-function concept for the\nvisualisation of the ground state structure of the discrete FK-model in the incommensurate case Aubry [19,20] has\nbeen shown that a new type of phase transition (called as breaking of analyticity) occurs when the amplitude of the\nperiodic potential increased beyond a critical value. That means, below a critical amplitude the hull-functions have a\ncontinuous (analytic) structure whereas above a critical amplitude the hull-functions are discrete (non analytic). In\nour numerical investigations of the hull-functions of the extended two chain model we have also found the transition\nby breaking of analyticity (Aubry transition). In order to distinguish, whether the Aubry transition is really about a\nsecond order phase transition, we have specifically studied this type of phase transition like Coppersmith and Fisher\n(but which have been investigate the behaviour near the maximum static friction force [17,18]) from the viewpoint of\ncritical phenomena. For that purpose we have introduced a suitable order parameter, which shows the typical critical\nbehaviour for second order phase transitions and critical exponents can be calculated via scaling arguments.\nHere, it should mentioned, that from the physical intuition a finite maximum static friction as function of the\ninteraction strength \u01eb has to exist in all previous introduced models equal whether one choose a commensurate or an\nincommensurate ground state structure. The main differences are the following. In the commensurate case the static\nfriction is always larger than zero for any \u01eb > 0. By way of contrast, in the incommensurate case whether the static\nfriction is equal or unequal zero depends strongly on \u01eb below or above a critical value \u01ebc due to the preculiar breaking\nof analyticity. Hence the commensurate and the incommensurate ground state structure reveals two types of physical\nsystem classes characterizing by different critical behaviour in the sliding state near the threshold force Fc . The first\nclass is given by model systems with a commensurate ground state structurce. Effectively, commensurate models are\ncharacterized by finitely many internal degrees of freedom, which lead to trivial critical exponents in the sliding state\nfor the velocity-force characteristic near the threshold Fc . An incommensurate ground state structure is equivalent\nto a second class of models with infintely many internal degrees of freedom. Well, both model classes emphasize\nthe fact that the nature of static and kinetic friction is deeply rooted with internal degrees of freedom generated by\na complex atomic interaction behaviour, which is the key for unterstanding dissipation in general. Commensurate\nmodel have one main disadvantage, because an uniquely visualisation concept for the ground state structure like\nthe hull-function for the incommensurate case is missing. Moreover, commensurate models exist always in a pinned\nground state structure, that means, models imply static friction for any value of the amplitude of the interaction\nstrength larger then zero intrinsicly. Therefore, for understanding the physical fundamental mechanism of the arising\nof static friction it seems to be most interesting to study incommensurate models, because the ground state shows\ntwo different incommensurate phases related to amazing properties. That means, an unpinned incommensurate phase\ncorresponds to zero static friction whereas the pinned incommensurate phase is equivalent to a finite static friction.\nIn the present paper we introduce the extended two chain model and the numerical calculation methods. The\ndetailed investigations of the static properties, especially the ground state structure of the extended two chain model\nare discussed by defining an order parameter and proposing scaling relations.\n2\n\n\fII. THE MODEL SYSTEM\nFollowing Matsukawa and Fukuyama [7,8], we introduce the extended two-chain model, which is a two-dimensional\nmicroscopic lattice model system describing wearless dry friction between two atomically flat solids. Therefore, we\nconsider two deformable atomic chains, so called an upper and a lower chain. The atoms in each chain are classical\npoint particles and are able to realize a two-dimensional movement. We assumed a harmonic particle interaction in\neach chain. The interaction between the two chains is of the Lennard-Jones type. Moreover, both chains are coupled\nharmonically on an upper or a lower substrat respectively. Like Ref. [7] the effects of energy dissipation in the upper\nand lower chain are phenomenologically approached to be proportional to the difference between the velocity of the\ni-th particle and that of the center of gravity. The external force F ex = (F ex , 0) acts on the upper chain in x direction\nwithout y component. In order to simplify the situation, we consider overdamped motion. The equations of motion\nfor the particles in the upper and the lower chain are given for each direction as follows (see also FIG. 1)\nNb\n\u0001\n\u0003\n\u0003 X\n\u0002\n\u0002 a\nax\nx\nxai \u2212 xbj + F ex\nFint\nxi \u2212 ica +\nma \u03b3a ( \u1e8bai \u2212 h\u1e8bai i ) = kax xai\u22121 + xai+1 \u2212 2xai \u2212 ksub\n\n(1)\n\nj=1\n\nma \u03b3a ( \u1e8fia\n\n\u2212\n\nh\u1e8fia i )\n\nmb \u03b3b \u1e8bbi \u2212 \u1e8bbi\n\n\u0001\n\nmb \u03b3b \u1e8fib \u2212 \u1e8fib\n\n\u0001\n\n=\n\nkay\n\n\u0002\n\na\nyi\u22121\n\n+\n\na\nyi+1\n\n\u2212\n\n2yia\n\n\u0003\n\n\u2212\n\nay \u0002 a\nksub\nyi\n\nNb\n\u0001\n\u0003 X\ny\nFint\nyia \u2212 yjb\n\u2212 (bb + L0 ) +\n\n(2)\n\nj=1\n\nNa\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0003 X\n\u0002 b\nbx\nx\n= kbx xbi\u22121 + xbi+1 \u2212 2xbi \u2212 ksub\nFint\nxbi \u2212 xaj\nxi \u2212 icb +\n\n(3)\n\nj=1\n\nNa\n\u0001\n\u0003\n\u0003 X\n\u0002 b\nby \u0002 b\ny\nb\nFint\nyib \u2212 yja ,\n= kby yi\u22121\nyi \u2212 bb +\n+ yi+1\n\u2212 2yib \u2212 ksub\n\n(4)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere r ai = (xai , yia ) and r bi = (xbi , yib ) are the immediately position vectors of the i-th particle in the upper and\nlower chain.

It should be mentioned, that\nthe particle mass and the friction coefficient are for all particles in each chain the same. For a compact representation\none can introduce the chain index\nD IE= (a, b)Prelating to the upper and lower chain.

The strenght of the coupling\nIy\nIx\nof each chain on an upper and a lower substrat is represented by ksub\n, which determine the rigiditiy of the\nand ksub\nchains. A further system parameter is the substrat-substrat distance L = ba + bb + L0 , where ba (bb ) is the mean\natomic spacings in y-direction between the upper (lower) chain and upper (lower) substrat. L0 denotes the distance\nbetween the two harmonical chains and is a function of their interaction strength. The interaction force between the\nupper and lower chain, projected on the x and y axes, can be written as\n\u0001\nNJ\nNJ\nX\nX\n\u0001\nxIi \u2212 xJj\nI\nJ\nx\nF (rij )\nFint xi \u2212 xj =\n(5)\nrij\nj=1\nj=1\nNJ\nX\nj=1\n\ny\nFint\n\nyiI\n\n\u2212\n\nyjJ\n\n\u0001\n\nNJ\nX\n\nyiI \u2212 yjJ\nF (rij )\n=\nrij\nj=1\n\n\u0001\n\n(6)\n\nq\nwith the chain indices I = (a, b), J = (b, a) and the distance rij = r ai \u2212 rbj \u2261 (xbi \u2212 xaj )2 + (yib \u2212 yja )2 relating to\nthe i-th atom of the upper (a) and the j-th atom of the lower (b) chain. F (rij ) can be expressed by the potential\n\u2202V (r )\nV (rij ) through F (rij ) = \u2212 \u2202rijij . As interaction potential we choose specifically the Lennard-Jones potential\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u00136 #\n12\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nV (rij ) = 4\u01eb\n(7)\n\u2212\nrij\nrij\nrepresenting the character of the friction due to the intermolecular forces in the best way. Here \u01eb is the strength\nof the interaction and \u03c3 is a characteristic length parameter, which parameterized the minimum of the potential\nV min = V (rij )|rij =r0 via the distance from equilibrium r0 = \u03c3 21/6 .\n3\n\n\fIII. NUMERICAL METHOD\nFor solving the two-dimensional extended two-chain lattice model we choose periodic boundary conditions in both\nchains\nxIi = xIi+NI \u2212 LI\nyiI\n\n=\n\n(8)\n\nI\nyi+N\nI\n\n(9)\n\nwith the chain index I = a, b and the chain lengths LI = NI cI . This implies that the system size of the upper and\nlower chain are the same L \u2261 Na ca = Nb cb . Hence, the ratio or the misfit of the two lattice constants could be\nexpressed by the particle numbers\n\u03b1=\n\nca\nNb\n=\n.\ncb\nNa\n\n(10)\n\nThis means, that the ratio \u03b1 of the two lattice constants is always a rational number in the numerical realisation.\nUsing the concept of the hull-function, which was introduced by Aubry and coworkers [19,20] for describing the ground\nstate of the underlying model system, we need an irrational ratio \u03b1 between ca and cb . If we have a rational \u03b1, i.e.,\nin the most commensurable case \u03b1 = 1, we cannot apply the concept of the hull-function. Because the whole ground\nstate configuration of each chain, consisted of NI particle positions, would be represented by one value of the argument\nof the hull function and hence the hull-function plot lose his mathematical power of proposition. For this reason, it is\nnecessary to investigate an incommensurate ground state structure relating to the ratio \u03b1 of the two lattice constants.\nUnfortunately, in the numerical calculation we could only approximate an irrational number through optimal rational\nratios of two natural numbers using a finite continued-fraction expansion up to a certain order [18,19]\n1\n\n\u03b1 = a0 +\n\n(11)\n\n1\n\na1 +\n\n1\n\na2 +\n...+\n\n1\nan\u22121 +\n\n1\nan\n\nFollowing the literature, we choose the simplest continued-fraction expansion with a0 = 1 and a1 = a2 = * * * = an = 1,\nso that \u03b1 could be expressed by the ratios of the Fibonacci numbers Fn+1 = Fn + Fn\u22121 , where n = 1, 2, 3, * * * as well\nas F0 = 1 and F1 = 1. Hence,\nFn+2\n3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597\n= , , ,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n, ***\n(12)\nFn+1\n2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987\n\u221a\n\u0001\nn+2\n1\n5 + 1 of the approximation series (12) is the inverse of the so-called\nand the irrational limit \u03b1 \u2261 limn\u2192\u221e F\nFn+1 = 2\ngolden mean. From the point of number theory [19] , this is the most incommensurable case of the underlying model\nsystem, which could be emulated in a systematical way. In our studies we set the lattice constant of the lower chain\nequal one (cb = 1). Accordingly, the upper mean lattice spacing ca is equal \u03b1 and we calculated with the system sizes\n\u03b1=\n\nca =\n\nNb\n89 233 377 610 1597\n=\n,\n,\n,\n,\n.\nNa\n55 144 233 377 987\n\n(13)\n\nIt should be mentioned, that not all ratios oft the approximants are \"good\" irrational number approximations in the\nsame manner because for certain particle number ratios there exist some artifacts in the hull function.\nFor the numerical calculation of the equations of motion we used a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with an\nadaptive stepsize control. In order to discuss the essential features of the present model we restrict the wide range\nIy\nIx\nof model parameters by setting mI = 1, \u03b3I = 1, kIx = kIy = 1, ksub\n= 1 and \u03c3 = 1. As initial conditions\n= ksub\nwe assumed at t = 0 a particle configuration in the x-y-plane, where the Na and Nb chain particles are arranged\nat regular lattice sites periodically. Besides, the distance L0 is set to an arbitrary initial value, i.e. L0 = 1. For\ncalculating the stable stationary states we used the same criterion like Kawaguchi and Matsukawa [10]. That means,\nwe used a velocitiy condition\nv\u0010\nu PNa\nPNb b 2 \u0011\na )2 +\nu\n(\n\u1e59\nj=1 (\u1e59j )\ni=1 i\nt\n< 10\u22125\n(14)\n(Na + Nb )\n4\n\n\ffor stopping the Runge-Kutta calculation. Hence, the system could be considered to be in a static state. The next\nstep consists in the check up of the total sum of the coupling forces in the (a)-chain and (b)-chain in x-direction\nax\nFsub\n=\n\nNa\nX\ni=1\n\n\u0003\n\u0002 a\nax\nksub\nxi \u2212 ica\n\nbx\nFsub\n=\n\n,\n\nNb\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0003\n\u0002 b\nbx\nksub\nxj \u2212 jcb\n\n(15)\n\nand y-direction\nay\nFsub\n\n=\n\nNa\nX\ni=1\n\nay \u0002 a\nksub\nyi\n\n\u2212 (bb + L0 )\n\n\u0003\n\n,\n\nby\nFsub\n\n=\n\nNb\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0003\nby \u0002 b\nksub\nyj \u2212 bb\n\n(16)\n\nrespectively. In absence of a driven force (F ex = 0) it is sufficient to consider only the value of the total sum of the\ncoupling forces (16) in y-direction, because for t = 0, after the Runge-Kutta steps and in the final state the x-direction\nforces (15) are equal to zero. The regular periodical arrangement of the particles for the initial time t = 0 leads to\nay\nby\nFsub\n= Fsub\n= 0. After the relaxation in the final stationary state relating to the velocity condition (14) the total\nsum of coupling forces (16) must always be zero, which is in general not true for an arbitrary chosen initial value\nL0 . Accordingly, during the numerical calculation every final stable state in respect to L0 must be proofed and if\nnecessary L0 must be changed like L0 = L0 \u00b1 \u03b4L0 . Then the chains relax again and the procedure would be repeated\nby\nay\n< 5 * 10\u22125 ( \u2243 0 ). In this\n= Fsub\nuntil the system reached a final stationary state, which fulfil the condititon Fsub\nway we could find numerically the stationary configuration of the extended two-chain model and for F ex = 0 one can\nassumed that this is approximately the ground state, defined as having an energy which cannot be lowered by moving\nof some system particles. The properties of the ground state could be analysed by changing the interaction strength\n\u01eb, which corresponds to set the correct L0 = L0 (\u01eb) numerically.\nIn the presence of an external force F ex > 0 acting in x-direction one must slightly change the numerical calculation\nax\nbx\nax\nbx\nprocedure. Instead of Fsub\n= Fsub\n= 0 the x-direction forces (15) have for t = 0 the values Fsub\n= F ex and Fsub\n=0\nrespectively. After each Runge-Kutta step we have to guarantee that the control parameters (15) have again these\nvalues. Hence, we are able to evolve the model system from the ground state into the last possible static solution by\ncontinuously increasing of the applied external force. In this sense we could numerically define the threshold, where no\nlonger a static solution of the underlying system exist. This threshold F ex = Fc is the critical force of static friction,\nwhich is also called maximum static frictional force. Below F ex < Fc the chains are in a steady state, such that the\nafterwards space-time averaged velocity v \u2261 h\u1e8bai ii,t = 0. Above F ex > Fc the upper chain, which is after an initial\ntransient decay in a steady sliding state, slides with a constant velocity v. Note, in an easy way one can investigate\nthe present model in a gravitational field via the constraints (16).\nIV. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nA. Ground state\nFirst, we investigate the stationary states of the extended two-chain model in the absence of an external force, i.e.,\nF ex = 0. The stationary states are given by the solution of equation system (1-4) with vanishing right-hand side\n\u0001\n0 = ma \u03b3a ( \u1e59 ai \u2212 h\u1e59ai i ) = mb \u03b3b \u1e59 bi \u2212 \u1e59 bi\n(17)\na\n\nax\ny\nbx\nbx\nwith consideration of the conditions (15) and (16), where Fsub\n= Fsub\n= Fsub\n= Fsub\n= 0. Hence, the ground state of\nthe extended two chain model is the stationary particle configuration having the minimal potential energy for F ex = 0.\nThe knowledge of the ground state determine a physical system, such as the static friction, completely.\n\n1. The hull-function\nSimilarly to the FK model [19] or FKT model [11], the lattice structure of the particle positions in the incommensurate\nground state can be uniformly described by a hull-function. For examining the lattice structure of the present twodimensional extended two-chain model, it is necessary to introduce four hull-function due to two degrees of freedom\nof the particles in each chain. The two hull-functions ha and hc of the upper chain are defined as\n\n5\n\n\fxai = i ca + \u03c6 + ha (i ca + \u03c6)\nyia = bb + L0 + \u03c6\u2032 + hc (i ca + \u03c6\u2032 )\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nand the two hull-function hb and hc of the lower chain are given by\nxbi = i cb + \u03c8 + hb (i cb + \u03c8)\nyib = bb + \u03c8 \u2032 + hd (i cb + \u03c8 \u2032 ) ,\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 , \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 are constant phases. For our investigations, it is conviencent to set \u03c6 = \u03c6\u2032 = \u03c8 = \u03c8 \u2032 = 0. The\nhull-functions are periodic and even, which can usually be expressed by\nha (z + cb ) = ha (z) = \u2212ha (\u2212z),\nhb (z + ca ) = hb (z) = \u2212hb (\u2212z),\n\nhc (z + cb ) = hc (z) = \u2212hc (\u2212z)\nhd (z + ca ) = hd (z) = \u2212hd (\u2212z) .\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nThe argument z of ha and hc is defined in the range from 0 to cb , whereas of hc and hd it is given from 0 to ca . Note,\nthe visualisation concept of the hull-function makes it necessary that the argument of the just defined hull-functions\nha , hc or hb , hd must be the same, respectively. Because, the displacements in x- resp. y-direction of all particle\nin each chain can be assigned to different values of the argument z due to the irrational ratio \u03b1 of the mean lattice\nspacing ca and cb .\nFirst, we have numerically calculated the ground state of the extended two-chain model for a fixed ratio \u03b1 = Nb /Na\nof the particle numbers given by Na = 233 and Nb = 377. Several investigations of the FK model [20], FKT model\n[11] such as the two-chain model [10] showed, that the ground state strongly depends on the interaction strength \u01eb.\nTherefore, we started the computation for different values of \u01eb in the wide range from 0.05 to 0.4. For small values\nof \u01eb up to a certain value \u01ebc we get the result that the periodic hull-functions ha , hb , hc and hd are analytic, i.e,\nsmooth and continuous. This behaviour is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the interaction strength has the value \u01eb = 0.22.\nFurthermore, the stationary state for \u01eb = 0.22 is characterized by the distance L0 = 0.986273 between the upper and\nlower chain. Figure 3 shows another numerical calculation of the hull-functions for the interaction strength \u01eb = 0.33\nwith the corresponding distance L0 = 0.959584. We can see that the hull-functions in Fig. 3 are discrete, which\nmeans that they are no longer analytic. This discrete structure is related to jumps, which occur at certain points of\nthe argument z of the hull-functions. Now, the comparison of Fig. 2 with Fig. 3 shows the phenomenon of breaking of\nanalyticity, which is due to two significant aspects of the hull-functions ha , hb , hc and hd for the interaction strength\n\u01eb < \u01ebc and \u01eb > \u01ebc , which defined a certain transition value \u01ebc above the hull-functions are no longer analytic. For a\ndetailed analysis of the threshold \u01ebc we introduced a suitable order parameter in the following part.\nWell, Aubry has shown [20] that the breaking of analyticity of the incommensurate ground state of the FK model\nis characterized by the existence of a largest central gap at the half of the period of the hull-function. Whereas the\nsituation in the two-chain model of Matsukawa and Fukuyama [10] is quite different for several elastic parameters and\nthree simple cases are observed: both hull-functions ha and hb have a largest gap at the half of the period (FK limes),\nwhether ha or hb has only a largest central gap and finally both hull-functions do not have a largest central gap but\ntwo symmetrical gaps with the same size refering to the half of the period. In Fig. 3 we can also observe that no\nlargest central gap for all hull-functions of the extended two-chain model exists. Furthermore, the hull-functions show\nalso two symmetrical gaps of the same size refering to the half of the period of the hull-function in the whole analysed\nparameter range. Up to now we have only investigated the ground state structure for a fixed system size (Na = 233\nand Nb = 377) and a certain range of interaction strength \u01eb. Now, we vary the system size of the underlying model\nwhich corresponds the different approximation orders of the irrational number through a rational ratio of the particle\nnumbers. Here, we calculated especially the ground state structure for the ratios \u03b1 = 89/55, 233/144, 610/377, and\n1597/987 in the same range of the interaction strength \u01eb like above. In particular, we proofed whether there occurs an\nanormalous behaviour in the structure of the hull-functions for certain values of \u01eb due to the using of a rational ratio\ninstead of an irrational number in the numerical computation. Indeed, Fig. 4 shows such a anormalous behaviour of\nthe hull-functions for \u01eb = 0.33 and for the particle numbers Na = 377 and 610. In the comparison with Fig. 3 we can\nrecognize that the even particle number Nb = 610 generates a wrong particle position at the half of the period x = 0.5\nof hb in Fig. 4 due to the periodical boundary condition. Consequently, in term of a suitable rational particle ratio\nFig. 3 shows the right picture of the hull-functions for \u01eb = 0.33, whereas Fig. 4 shows some artifacts in the hull-function\nstructure for the same interaction strength \u01eb = 0.33 as a result of bad choice Na = 377 and Nb = 610 of the system\nsize for the interaction strength \u01eb = 0.33. Beyond it, there appear much more artifacts in the hull-function structure\ndifferent ranges of \u01eb als consequence of a bad choice for the particle number ratios. For Na = 144 and Nb = 233 the\noccurence of such artifacts destroyed the order parameter analysis of the transition area. Kawaguchi and Matsukawa\ninterpreted in [10] these artifacts, which also occur in the two-chain model for certain values of the interchain strength\nand Na = 144, Nb = 233, as information of the appearance of a new gap structure at the elastic parametes Kb . This\n6\n\n\finterpretation is wrong, because, if they calculated the model system with the same interaction strength for different\nparticle numbers these artifacts will be vanished. The appearence of artifacts in the hull-function for the ground state\ndefines the range of validity of the hull-function concept for several \u01eb in the numerical calculation, which makes it\nnecessary to proof the hull-function structure for the same \u01eb for several system size. Relating to stationary state which\nis given by Eq.(17), Fig. 5 shows the distance L0 between the upper and the lower chain as a function of the strength\n\u01eb of the interaction force, which was calculated for the particle numbers Na = 233 and Nb = 377. The plot in Fig. 5(a)\nshows the computation of L0 for \u01eb in range from 0.05 to 0.45 and Fig.5(b) shows L0 in the transition area. Note, the\ndistance L0 is remarkably insensitiv to the system size. For the system sizes \u03b1 = 377/233, 610/377, and 1597/987\nwe found a deviation for L0 = L0 (\u03b1) smaller than 10\u22125 . In the occurence of local artifacts in the hull-functions for\ncertain particle numbers and certain interaction strength the deviation for L0 (\u03b1) lies in the order 10\u22124 . Note, that in\nthe ground state above the transition point \u01ebc also many local rearrangements take place which can be identified as\nfirst order phase transitions.\n2. The order parameter\nNow, we analyse the transition of breaking the analyticity near the threshold \u01ebc in terms of second order phase\ntransition. For this it is convenient to introduce an order parameter, which is an indicator for the occurence of a\nphase transition at a critical point. The order parameter distinguishs both phases which are involved in the phase\ntransition, because it is defined to be zero in one phase. Refering to the transition of breaking of analyticity the order\nparameter is defined in the discrete phase, which measures the discrete jumps in the hull-functions. Therefore the\norder parameter is in the continuous phase for \u01eb < \u01ebc equal to zero and in the discrete phase above \u01ebc unlike zero.\nHere, we use the definition\n\nOPm =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u2202 m f (z)\n\u2202z m\n\u03b4(0)\n\n2\n\ndz\n.\n\n(24)\n\nHere, \u03b4(0) behaves like \u03b4(0) \u223c \u2206z \u22121 |\u2206z\u21920 . If the hull-function is smooth in the interval [0, 1], the integral becomes\nfinite and the order parameter vanished due to the prefactor \u03b4(0) \u22121 . On the other hand, if f (z) has a discrete\nR1\nR1\nR1\nstep at z0 , we obtain \u2202z f (z) \u223c \u03b4(z \u2212 z0 ) and therefore 0 [\u2202z f (z)]2 dz \u223c 0 \u03b4(z \u2212 z0 )2 dz \u223c \u03b4(0) 0 \u03b4(z \u2212 z0 ) \u223c \u03b4(0),\ni.e. the order parameter becomes finite. Due to the finite system size, which devides the region of integration in\nequidistant subintervals \u2206z = 1/Na (\u2206z = 1/Nb ) for the upper (lower) chain, the integral in Eq.(24) reduced to a\nsum over the particle numbers. Therefore, we have intrinsic discontinuities in the numerical computation, because the\nhull-functions are given by a discrete set of points at \u2206z at all, which define the systematical error of the calculation.\nIn order to smeared out the systematical intrinsic discontinuities, we choose for our numerical investigation OP4 as\norder parameter. Hence, we get the following expression\n\nOP \u2261 OP4 =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u2202 4 f (z)\n\u2202z 4\n\u03b4(0)\n\n2\n\ndz\n\n(Nb \u22122)\n\nNa \u22122\nX\n1\n\u2261\n6\n(\u2206z)\n\n| fk+2 \u2212 4 fk+1 + 6 fk \u2212 4fk\u22121 + fk\u22122 |\n\nk=2\n\n\u00012\n\n(25)\n\nIt should mentioned, that OP shows necessary for all hull-functions ha , hc , hc and hd the same qualitativ behaviour.\nTherefore, in order to show all basic features of the phase transition (transition of breaking of analyticity) it is enough\nto calculate OP (via Eq.(25)) only for the hull-function ha = ha (z).\n3. The scaling behaviour\nNext we have calculated the order parameter given by Eq.(25) for different system sizes \u03b1 = 89/55, 233/377, 610/377\nand 1597/987. Figure 6(a) shows the order parameter as function of the interaction strength \u01eb in the transition region.\nWe clearly see that the order parameter OP is changed from zero below a certain critical threshold \u01ebc to a value unlike\nzero above \u01ebc for all particle number ratios. This is a certain hint that the transition of breaking of analyticity is a\nsecond order phase transition. Using a finite-size scaling [23,24] for the data in Fig. 6(a) given by the scaling function\n\u0010 1\n\u0011\n\u03b2\nOP (\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebc , L) = L \u03b4 OP L \u03b4 (\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebc )\n(26)\n7\n\n\fwe find that the order parameter OP exhibits a scaling behaviour in the transition region shown in Fig. 6(b). That\nmeans, all curves of Fig. 6(a) could mastered on one resulting curve (Fig. 6(b)). The system size L is determined\nby the particle numbers 55, 233, 377 and 987. In the transition region, which can be characterized by the reduced\ninteraction strength t = (\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebc )/\u01ebc , we find that the data of Fig. 6(b) are consistent with the following power law for\n\u01eb > \u01ebc\n\u03b2\n\nOP (\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebc ) \u223c L \u03b4 (\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebc )\u03b2\n\n(27)\n\nwith the critical exponents \u03b2 = 0.239 \u00b1 0.05, \u03b4 = 0.687 \u00b1 0.05 defining the ratio \u03bc = \u03b2/\u03b4 \u2248 0.347 \u00b1 0.05. Due to\nthe finite-size scaling we obtain for the threshold interaction strength of the transition of breaking of analyticity the\ncritical value \u01ebc = 0.25575 \u00b1 0.001.\nB. The static friction\nIn the following we want to calculate the maximum static friction force Fc of the extended two-chain model refering to\na pinning structure which is given in the incommensurate case for \u01eb > \u01ebc . It is clear that in the presence of an applied\nforces F ex > 0 ground states are no longer defined. From the physical intuition, we hope that one can adiabatically\nevolve the underlying model system from the ground state by increasing F ex from zero, because the threshold force\nFc is the largest depinning force F ex above no a longer stationary state exist, i.e., Eq.(17) is no longer valid. Like\nRef. [10] the static friction is given by\nFR = \u2212\n\nNb\nNa X\nX\ni=1 j=1\n\nFint xai \u2212 xbj\n\n\u0001\n\nt\n\n\u2261 Na h F ex it\n\n(28)\n\nwhich can be obtained from the equation of motion (1)-(4) by summing over i and averaging with respect to t. It\nshould remarked, that Eq.(28) is also valid for the calculation of the kinetic friction in a sliding state, i.e., for F ex > Fc .\nFor the determination of the threshold force Fc , we choose especially the interaction force \u01eb = 0.33 and the system\nsize Na = 233 and Nb = 377. Note, the numerical calculations of Fc for the extended two-chain model are very hard\nand the computation time is very large. In a first calculation, we find that the maximum static friction force has\napproximately the value Fc \u2248 0.4 but the numerical deviation is very large. Therefore, it takes much more efforts in\norder to calculate the accurate value of the threshold force.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have investigated the ground state for a two-dimensional extended two-chain model with an incommensurate\nlattice structure. We have found that the structure of the hull-functions depends strongly on the strength \u01eb of the\ninteraction between the upper and the lower body. It was numerically observed the breaking of analyticity in the\nground state for the critical value \u01ebc = 0.25575. Furthermore, it was shown that this type of phase transition could\nbe uniform described by an order parameter. This order parameter representation allows a systematic analysis of the\ncritical behaviour for \u01eb > \u01ebc due to the calculation of the critical exponents. Consequently, the peculiar breaking of\nanalyticity shows all features of a second order phase transition.\nA second interesting result of the ground state structure occurs in associtation with the numerical computation\nfor different interaction strengths as function of the rational system sizes. It has been shown that artifacts in the\nhull-functions structure appear for certain rational particle numbers of a fixed interaction strength \u01eb. This fact pointed\nout that the correct ground state structure depends strongly on the choose of sufficient rational ratio of the particle\nnumbers as a irrational number approximation for a certain range of the interaction force.\nConcerning the static properties of the extended two-chain model in the presence of an applied forces F ex > 0 we\nhave calculated the maximum static friction force Fc .\nFinally, it should remarked, that the extended two-chain model is a simple model structure , which established the\nmacroscopic dry friction situation on the microscopic level between atomically flat surfaces by using a simple driven\nmechanical many-body system. It is convenient to define the model as simple as possible in order to dicuss some\nbasic features like the ground state structure or the maximum static friction behaviour. Therefore we took in our\ninvestigation a simple relaxation dynamic into account and neglected thermal fluctuation (T = 0 K). Surely, such\nkind of microscopic models could be always extended by additional thermal fluctuations representing by stochastical\nforces which leads to creep in the presence of applied forces. Note, the vality of the underlying model system is given\n8\n\n\fby the assumption of simple harmonic particle interaction. It is clear that this assumption in many real systems where\nlarge distortions occur.\nNote, there are one possible and very interesting extention of the extended two-chain model by the introduction\nof quenched randomess which corresponds surface impurities. It is an open question, whether randomess destroy the\nfrictionless state in the incommensurate case for \u01eb < \u01ebc in the extended two-chain model like in the FK-model [7,8].\nWell, it is an interesting question, whether randomess, which exists in any real system, leads in general to a finite\nmaximum static friction force for any interaction strength \u01eb. Refering to the compare whith experiments, another\nnatural extention of the present model is to proceed to a three-dimensional system, which is able to describe wearless\ndry friction between two atomically flat plans pinning in each case on a substrat and embeding in a three-dimensional\nspace.\nIn later works we want to investigate the threshold behaviour near Fc especially for F ex > Fc . It should be proofed\nwhether the velocity-force characteristics shows a critical behaviour or not. Well, for a complete understanding of\nthe behaviour near the threshold Fc a renormalization group calculation is needed, but surely very complicated for a\ndeterministic mechanical system.\nNote in the present paper, we have considered a simple overdamped motion. Hence, it is also interesting to discuss\nthe influence of inertia terms (underdamped dynamic) on the behaviour near the threshold Fc and on the sliding\nstate.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been supported by the Graduiertenkolleg \"Defektstrukturbestimmte physikalische Eigenschaften\" and\nthe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG (SFB 418).\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n20\n21\n22\n\n23\n24\n\nB.N.

The external force F\u0303 ex is given by the\napplied force F F ex which acts on each particle of the upper chain times the particle number Na of the upper chain\nwhere Na , (Nb ) is the particle number of upper (lower) chain.\nFIG. 2. The hull-functions of the ground state plotted for the particle numbers Na = 233 and Nb = 377 with the\ninteraction strength \u01eb = 0.22. For an uniform representation all hull-functions are renormalized by the mean lattice spacing cb and ca , respectively. Therefore, the substitution for the hull-function ha and hc of the (a)-chain is\nz \u2192 z \u2032 = z/cb , whereas for the hull-functions hb and hd of the (b)-chain it is z \u2192 z \u2032 = z/ca .\nFIG. 3.
