Our method of conformal maps allows us to investigate the statistical properties of the\ntopological complexity of a bunch of 3\u2013strand Brownian braids and to compute the expectation\nvalue of the irreducible braid length in the non-Abelian case.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOur paper presents some results concerning geometry and statistics of random three-strand braids. Besides the\nrelevance of this work at a purely algebraic level (see, for example, [12] for a review of principal topological problems),\nits usefulness in the understanding statistical physics of entangled lines, independent on their physical nature, is\nalso undeniable. Statistics of ensembles of uncrossible linear objects with topological constraints has very broad\napplication area ranging from problems of self-diffusion of directed polymer chains in flows and nematic-like textures\nto dynamical and topological aspects of vortex glasses in high\u2013Tc superconductors [3, 4]. In order to have representative\nand physically clear image for the system of fluctuating lines with non-Abelian (i.e. noncommutative) topology we\nformulate the model in terms of entangled Brownian trajectories: such representation serves also as a geometrically\nclear image of Wilson loops in (2+1)D non-Abelian field\u2013theoretic path integral formalism. In particular our paper\nfocuses on the geometrical, algebraic and statistical properties of the simplest non-commutative braid group B3 .\nConsider the ensemble of N particles randomly moving in the complex plane z = x+iy. Let us label the coordinates\nof these particles by zj (t) = xj (t) + iyj (t) where 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N and t is the current \"time\" (the initial configuration of\nthe particles corresponds to t = 0). It is clear that in (2+1)D \"space-time\" (z, t) the diffusive motion of all particles is\ndescribed by the statistics of N \"world lines\" or \"directed polymers\" and the time t plays the role of the length of the\n\"world line\". In what follows we shall assume the periodic boundary conditions, i.e. we shall suppose that at some\ntime t = T the configuration of the particles in the plane z is just the permutation of the initial configuration, i.e.\n{z1 (T ), ..., zN (T )} = P{z1(0), ..., zN (0)}, P being a permutation of N elements. Thus, under the natural condition\nzj (t) 6= zk (t) for any 1 \u2264 {k, j} \u2264 N , the \"world lines\" shall be entangled.\nThe topology of the braid can play a crucial role in macroscopic physical properties. Let us mention only two\nexamples. The elastic properties of polymer networks strongly depend on the initial degree of entanglement between\nsubchains forming the sample and, hence, the elastic properties of the rubbers can be controlled by different initial\nconditions of samples preparation [5, 7]. In Cu02 \u2013based high\u2013Tc superconductors in fields less than the critical\nmagnetic field Hc2 there exists a region where the Abrikosov flux lattice is molten, but the sample of the superconductor\ndemonstrates the absence of the conductivity. This effect is explained by highly entangled state of flux lines due to\ntheir topological constraints [3, 8].\nWe restrict our study to N = 3, i.e. to the case of 3\u2013strand braids produced by bunches of \"word lines\" of 3 particles\nsimultaneously moving in the complex plane z (see fig.1). The simplest non-commutative group B3 is defined on the\nprojection of this bunch onto the plane (t, x) as it is shown in fig.1. The group B3 is constituted by the set of\n\n\f2\ngenerators {\u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c31\u22121 , \u03c32\u22121 } satisfying commutation relations explicited below. Each topological configuration can\nbe exactly encoded by an element of the braid group B3 , that is a \"word\" written in terms of \"letters\"\u2013the braid group\ngenerators, associated to elementary moves\u2013positive/negative crossings in the projection (see fig.1). A configuration\nof the braid corresponds at the time t = T to an element \u03c9T of B3 .\nWe are interested in an explicit construction of topological invariants of entanglements of such world lines i.e., in the\n3\u2013strand random \"braid\" \u03c9T . We investigate and evaluate the complexity of such randomly generated braid, defined\nas the minimal number of generators L(\u03c9T ) necessary to write \u03c9T . This quantity L(\u03c9T ) is called the irreducible\nlength (in the metric of words) and exactly coincides with the minimal number of crossings necessary to represent the\nentanglement. Therefore L(\u03c9T ) can be chosen as an indicator of the braid complexity. In particular, if L(\u03c9t ) = 0 the\nbraid is trivial (i.e. the strands are unentangled).\n\nFIG. 1: Braiding of three directed lines. Elementary moves \u03c3i in the projection generate the group B3 .\n\nIn what follows we shall repeatedly use the so-called Burau matrix representation of the braid group. In the\nparticular case of the group B3 the Burau representation is given by 2 \u00d7 2 matrices:\n!\n!\n\u2212t 1\n1 0\n\u03c31 =\n;\n\u03c32 =\n(1)\n0 1\nt \u2212t\nwhere t is a free parameter. It is known that for B3 this representation is faithful [12]. When t = \u22121 the group B3\ncoincides with the modular group P SL(2, Z).\nThe paper is structured as follows. The first part introduces the basic notions of homotopy groups and homotopic\nlength, necessary to self-contained description of topological invariants. The method proposed in this part, demonstrates on the simplest examples how the monodromy representations of groups allows one to build the universal\ncoverings, giving rise to topological invariants, associated at a physical level to fluxes of non-Abelian extension of\n\"solenoidal magnetic fields\". Using the same ideas, the second part deals with the case of B3 for which we explicitly\nderive a topological invariant, directly linked to the irreducible braid length, and construct its non-Abelian flat connection. For the model of ideal Brownian braids, the stochastic evolution of this topological invariant is given and its\nasymptotic distribution is derived.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nTOPOLOGICAL INVARIANTS AND MONODROMY REPRESENTATIONS\n\nA.\n\nBasic concepts and definitions\n\nLet us consider the double\u2013punctured complex plane C\u22c6\u22c6 = C \u2212 {z1 , z2 }, of variable z = x + iy and suppose the\ncoordinates of the punctures M1 and M2 to be z1 = (0, 0) and z2 = (c, 0) correspondingly. We set c \u2261 1 by appropriate\nrescaling of the plane z.\nTake now two closed elementary paths on z such that the first one (\u03b31 ) encloses only the point M1 and the second\none (\u03b32 ) surrounds only the point M2 . With the usual composition law of paths, \u03b31 and \u03b32 , generate a fundamental\ngroup F2 , which is the first homotopy group, \u03c01 , of the double\u2013punctured complex plane z:\n\u03c01 (C\u22c6\u22c6 ) = F2\nThe trivial path (the unit element of the group F2 ) is the composition of an arbitrary loop with its inverse: e =\n\u03b3i \u03b3i\u22121 = \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i , i = {1, 2}. The loops \u03b3i and \u03b3\u0303i are equivalent if \u03b3i can be continuously deformed into \u03b3\u0303i (the\nequivalent loops represent the same element of F2 ). We denote the class of equivalent paths by \u03b3i .\nAny element of the group F2 being finitely generated, corresponds to a closed path on z and can be represented\nby a \"word\" consisting of a sequence of letters\u2013generators of the group F2 : {\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b31\u22121 , \u03b32\u22121 }. Each word can be\nreduced to a minimal (or \"irreducible\") representation. For example, the word W = \u03b31 \u03b32\u22121 \u03b31 \u03b31 \u03b31\u22121 \u03b32\u22121 \u03b32 \u03b31\u22121 \u03b32\u22121 \u2261\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0002 \u0002\n\u03b31 \u03b32\u22121 \u03b31 \u03b31 \u03b31\u22121 \u03b32\u22121 \u03b32 \u03b31\u22121 \u03b32\u22121 can be reduced to W = \u03b31 \u03b32\u22121 \u03b32\u22121 . Consider now a finitely generated group\nG = hg1 , g2 i (to be more precise, the group admitting only one\u2013 or two\u2013generators presentation). We are interested\nin the monodromy representation of F2 into G defined by the following group homomorphism \u03a8:\n(\nF2 \u2212\u2192 G\n\u03a8:\n(2)\n\u03b3i \u2212\u2192 gi (i = 1, 2)\nNote that this straightforwardly can be generalized to the case of multi\u2013punctured surfaces or other topological spaces.\nWe do not discuss in details the existence of such homomorphism, assuming that it results mainly from the fact that\nF2 is a free group.\nOur main goal in the present paper consists in defining an explicit geometrical construction of a non-Abelian\ngeneralization of a Gauss topological invariant (i.e. a \"linking number\") for different groups G using the monodromy\nrepresentations of G. In particular, we construct a complex flat connection A(z) on C\u22c6\u22c6 , i.e. a \"Bohm-Aharonov\u2013like\nvector potential\" A(z), whose holonomy gives rise to a representation of G. A special attention is paid to the case\nwhen G = B3 . Moreover, we use the developed approach to estimate the averaged complexity of a 3\u2013strand braid\nrepresented by independent motion of 3 Brownian particles in (2+1) dimensions.\n\nB.\n\nTopological invariants from conformal maps\n\nIn order to explain the basic notions, we begin with the simplest possible case-the Abelian group Z and construct\nthe corresponding topological invariant by means of conformal transforms.\n\n1.\n\nAbelian case: commutative group G = Z\n\nThe central point of the approach deals with the reconstruction of a linear differential equation on the manifold C\u22c6\u22c6\nby its monodromy group G. In other words, defining the action of G on the space of solutions of some 2nd \u2013order liner\n\n\f4\ndifferential equation with two branching points, we are attempting to recover the form of this differential equation\nand its solutions. In the case of G = Z it is natural to consider a usual 1-dimensional additive action\nn[w(z)] = w(z) + 2i\u03c0n\nfor w defined on C\u22c6\u22c6 and n \u2208 Z. It turns out that the simplest linear differential equation with two branching points,\nsatisfying those conditions is:\n(z \u2212 z1 )(z \u2212 z2 )\n\ndw\n\u2212 2z + z1 + z2 = 0\ndz\n\n(3)\n\nwhose solution reads\nw(z) = ln(z \u2212 z1 ) + ln(z \u2212 z2 )\n\n(4)\n\nOne can check that the free group \u03932 acts on the space of solutions as follows\n{\u03b31 ,\u03b32 }\n\nw(z) \u2212\u2192 w(z) + 2i\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\nwhich means that the homomorphism \u03a8 is trivial in for this example: \u03a8(\u03b3i ) = 1 (i = 1, 2). The function w(z)\nconformally maps the doubly punctured plane to the universal covering space w = u + iv free of any branching points.\nIn the complex plane w we have\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 u = ln |(z \u2212 z1 )(z \u2212 z2 )|\n\uf8f3 v = arg(z \u2212 z ) + arg(z \u2212 z )\n1\n2\n\nThe function w(z|z1 , z2 ) is a topological invariant because of equality (5). In particular, the function v(z|z1 , z2 ) defines\nthe total number of turns in the plane z around the branching points z1 and z2 and hence it is nothing else as the\nGauss linking number.\nThus, knowing the conformal transform w(z) of the multiply punctured plane C\u22c6\u22c6 to the universal (i.e. uniformizing)\ncovering surface, we can easily extract a topological invariant Inv(\u03b3) of a closed path \u03b3 (starting and ending at some\narbitrary point z0 6= {0, 1} in the plane z) from the difference win (z0 ) \u2212 wfin (z0 ). The path \u03b3 connects the images of\nthe point z0 on different Riemann sheets-the \"copies\" of the fundamental domain of G. Recall that by definition\nthe fundamental domain of a group G is a minimal connected domain tessellating the whole covering space under the\naction of G. Representing the topological invariant Inv(z) (\u03b3) as a full derivative along the contour \u03b3, we get:\ndef\n\nInv(z) (\u03b3) = wfin \u2212 win \u2261\n\nI\n\u03b3\n\ndw(z)\ndz =\ndz\n\nI\n\nA(z)dz\n\n(6)\n\nis very straightforward. The conformal transform w(z)\nThe physical interpretation of the derivative A(z) = dw(z)\ndz\nplays the role of a complex potential of a field A(z), which defines a flat connection of a multiple\u2013punctured plane\nC\u22c6\u22c6 .\nFor the commutative group G = Z we obtain A(z) by taking the derivative of (4):\nA(z) =\n\n1\n1\n+\nz \u2212 z1\nz \u2212 z2\n\n(7)\n\nThis expression can be easily identified with the standard (Abelian) Bohm\u2013Aharonov vector potential of two solenoidal\nmagnetic fields orthogonal to the plane z and crossing it in the points z1 and z2 .\nIn the next section the same construction of the flat connection associated to a specific group G will be generalized\nto the non-Abelian case.\n\n\f5\n2.\n\nNon-Abelian case: non-commutative groups F2 , Hq\n\nWe consider a special class of hyperbolic and hyperbolic\u2013like groups: the free (F2 ) and the Hecke (Hq ) groups,\nas well as the braid group B3 . By hyperbolic\u2013like groups we mean a class broader than hyperbolic groups in the\nclassification of M.Gromov [13]. (According to the Gromov's definition, the group B3 does not belong to the class of\nhyperbolic groups). The important feature for us would be just the exponential growth of the group. From this point\nof view the group B3 fits our scheme.\n1. The free group F2 (in general, Fn (n = 2, 3, 4, ...)) by definition is the free product of two (in general of n) copies\nof cyclic groups of second order, Z2 . The matrix representation of the generators of the free groups F2 {f1 , f2 } and\nF3 {f1 , S} are:\n!\n!\n1 2\n1 0\nF2 : f1 =\n; f2 =\n0 1\n2 1\n(8)\n!\n!\n1 2\n0 1\nF3 : f1 =\n; S=\n0 1\n\u22121 0\n2. The Hecke group Hq is the free product of two cyclic groups Z2 , and Zq of orders 2 and q respectively. The Hecke\ngroup is defined by the relations\n(STq )q = bqq = 1\nS 2 = a22 = 1\nwhere the generators Tq and S have the following matrix representation\n!\n!\n1 2 cos \u03c0q\n0 1\nHq : T q =\n; S=\n\u22121 0\n0\n1\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nThe parameter q takes discrete values q = 3, 4, 5, 6, . . .. The Hecke group Hq \"interpolates\" between the modular\ngroup P SL(2, Z) (for q = 3) and the free group F3 with 3 generators (q \u2192 \u221e).\nWe have stressed in the previous section that the topological invariant can be constructed on the basis of the\nconformal map w(z) of multiple\u2013punctured plane to the universal covering space of a group. We now extend the\ndescribed method to more interesting cases than considered at length of the section II B 1.\nWe derive the conformal mapping of the half\u2013plane Im z > 0 onto the fundamental domain of the triangular group\nG-a curvilinear triangle lying in the upper half\u2013plane Im w > 0. The action of G on this fundamental domain\ngenerates the whole covering space. Each copy of the fundamental domain represents a Riemann sheet corresponding\nto the fibre bundle above z and the whole covering space w is the unification of all such Riemann sheets-see fig.2.\nThe coordinates of initial and final points of a trajectory on the universal covering w determine:\n\u2022 The coordinates of the corresponding points on z;\n\u2022 The element of G corresponding to the homotopy class of the path on z.\nFollowing the construction described in the previous section let us define the action of G{g1 , g2 } in the complex\nplane w = u + iv. The group G admits the faithful 2\u2013dimensional representations and acts in the covering space w by\nfractional\u2013linear transforms. Consider two basic contours \u03b31 and \u03b32 , associated to the action of G on z (z 6= {z1 , z2 , \u221e}.\nThe contours \u03b31 and \u03b32 enclose the branching points located at z1 and z2 correspondingly (z 6= {z1 , z2 , \u221e}). The\nfunction w(z) (z 6= {z1 , z2 , \u221e}) obeys the following transformations:\nh\ni\nh\ni\na2 w(z) + b2\na1 w(z) + b1\n\u03b32\n\u03b31\n; w z \u2192 z \u2192 w\u03032 (z) =\n(11)\nw z \u2192 z \u2192 w\u03031 (z) =\nc1 w(z) + d1\nc2 w(z) + d2\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 2: Conformal transforms of the upper half-plane Im z > 0 to the fundamental domain of the group F2 (up) and of the\ngroup P SL(2, Z) (down).\n\nThe matrices g1 and g2\ng1 =\n\na1 b 1\nc1 d1\n\n!\n\n;\n\ng2 =\n\na2 b 2\nc2 d2\n\n!\n\n(12)\n\nare the matrices of basic substitutions of the group G{g1 , g2 }, i.e. g1 and g2 are the generators of G.\nIt is well known that the function w(z) can be defined as the quotient of two fundamental solutions u1 (z) and u2 (z)\nof a second order differential equation with branching points {z1 = (0, 0), z2 = (0, 1), z3 = \u221e}. As it follows from\nthe analytic theory of differential equations, the solutions u1 (z) and u2 (z) undergo the linear substitutions when the\nvariable z moves along the contours \u03b31 and \u03b32 :\n!\n!\n!\n!\nu1 (z)\nu1 (z)\n\u01691 (z)\n\u01691 (z)\n(13)\n; \u03b32 :\n= g2\n\u03b31 :\n= g1\nu2 (z)\nu2 (z)\n\u01692 (z)\n\u01692 (z)\nwhere g1 and g2 are the generators of the monodromy group of this equation. The problem of restoring the form of\na differential equation by the monodromy matrices g1 and g2 of the group G of the differential equation, is known as\nthe Riemann-Hilbert problem. Yet we restrict ourselves with the groups F2 and Hq , the group B3 shall be considered\nseparately.\nThe free group F2 . For the free group F2 the solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem gives rise to the following\nsecond\u2013order differential equation [14]:\nz(z \u2212 1)\n\nd2 u(z)\ndu(z) 1\n+ (2z \u2212 1)\n+ u(z) = 0\ndz 2\ndz\n4\n\nIndeed, a possible basis of solutions of this equation is as follows:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 u1 (z) = F (1/2, 1/2, 1, z)\n\n\uf8f3 u (z) = iF (1/2, 1/2, 1, 1 \u2212 z)\n2\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\n\f7\nUsing the well\u2013known properties of hypergeometric functions, one can restore the monodromy matrices defined in\n(13) for this basis:\n!\n!\n1 0\n1 \u22122\ng1 =\n;\ng2 =\n(16)\n2 1\n0 1\nwhich coincides with the generating set of the group F2 . The function w(z) performing the conformal map of the\nupper half\u2013plane Imz > 0 onto the fundamental domain (the curvilinear triangle ABC) of the universal covering w\nsatisfies eq.(11) and can be written as:\nw(z) =\n\nu1 (z)\nu2 (z)\n\n(17)\n\nThe function w(z) is well known in the literature (see, for example, [14]) and its inverse z(w) is the elliptic modular\nfunction\n\u03b84 (0, w)\n(18)\nz(w) \u2261 \u03bb(w) = 24\n\u03b83 (0, w)\nNow we can give an explicit expression of the flat connection A(z) for the doubly punctured plane corresponding to\nthe monodromy of the free group F2 . Taking the derivatives and using the properties of the hypergeometric functions,\nwe get:\nA(z) =\nwhere\n\ndw(z)\nE(z)K(1 \u2212 z) + (E(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 K(1 \u2212 z))K(z)\n= \u2212i\ndz\n2z(z \u2212 1)K 2 (1 \u2212 z)\n\nK(z) =\n\nZ\u03c0/2\n0\n\nd\u03b8\n\np\n;\n1 \u2212 z sin2 \u03b8\n\n(19)\n\nZ\u03c0/2 p\nd\u03b8 1 \u2212 z sin2 \u03b8\nE(z) =\n\n(20)\n\n0\n\nare correspondingly the complete elliptic integrals K(z) and E(z) (see, for example, [15]).\nIn the Fig.3 we have plotted the absolute values |A(z)| of the Abelian (Eq.(7)) and the non-Abelian (Eq.(19)) flat\nconnections.\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\ny\n\n1\n\n2\n\ny\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nx\n\n-1 -1\n\nx\n\n-1 -1\n\nFIG. 3: The cuts of the function |A(z)| in the Abelian (left) and non-Abelian (right) cases.\n\nThe leading asymptotics of (19) are as follows:\n\u2212i\u03c0\nz ln2 z\nA(z) \u223c\n\u2212i\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03c0(z \u2212 1)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nas z \u2192 0\nas z \u2192 1\n\n(21)\n\n\f8\nHence even in the vicinity of the branching point z = 0 the function A(z) defined in (19) does not coincide asymptotically with the flat connection for the Abelian case (7).\nThe Hecke group Hq . We now pass to the case of Hq , keeping in mind that for q = 3 we recover the group\nP SL(2, Z), directly linked to B3 (B3 is a central extension of P SL(2, Z), see [12]). The solution of the corresponding\nRiemann-Hilbert problem leads to the following differential equation: [16]\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1\ndu(z, q) 1 1 1\nz\u2212 1\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nu(z, q) = 0\nq\ndz\n4 2 q\n\n(22)\n\nwhose possible basis of solution is:\n\uf8f1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nq\u22122 q\u22122\nq+2 q+2\n\uf8f4\ni\u03c0/q 1/q\n\uf8f4\n,\n, 1 \u2212 , z \u2212 \u03bb(q)e\nz F\n,\n,1 + ,z\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 u1 (z) = F\n4q\n4q\nq\n4q\n4q\nq\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8f4\n1\n1\nq+2 q+2\nq\u22122 q\u22122\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n,\n, 1 \u2212 , z + \u03bb(q)z 1/q F\n,\n,1 + ,z\n\uf8f3 u2 (z) = \u2212ei\u03c0/q F\n4q\n4q\nq\n4q\n4q\nq\n\n(23)\n\nz(z \u2212 1)\n\nd2 u(z, q)\n+\ndz 2\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n3 1\n\u2212\n2 q\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere\n\n\u03bb(q) = e2i\u03c0/q\n\n3q+2\n\u0393(1 \u2212 1q )\u0393( q+2\n4q )\u0393( 4q )\n\n3q\u22122\n\u0393(1 + q1 )\u0393( q\u22122\n4q )\u0393( 4q )\n\n(24)\n\nTaking into account that the series defining the hypergeometric functions F (z) converges for |z| < 1 and corresponds\nto the so-called logarithmic case (see [14]) one obtains from (23) the following monodromy matrices after proper\nanalytic continuation:\n!\n!\n2 cos \u03c0q 1\n0 \u22121\ni\u03c0/q\ng1 = e\n;\ng2 = i\n(25)\n1 0\n\u22121 0\nOne can check that after normalization by the determinant, the matrices (25) become the generators of Hq (correspondingly of orders q and 2). Let us point out that for q = 3, one can identify the inverse function z(w) with the\nKlein's \"absolute modular invariant\"\nz(w) \u2261 J(w) =\n\n(\u03b828 (0, w) + \u03b838 (0, w) + \u03b848 (0, w))3\n54\u03b828 (0, w)\u03b838 (0, w)\u03b848 (0, w)\n\nwhere \u03b82 , \u03b83 , \u03b84 are the Jacobi elliptic \u03b8\u2013functions. As in the previous section, the corresponding complex flat connection AHq (z) can be obtained as the full derivative\nAHq (z) =\n\ndwHq (z)\ndz\n\nfrom the conformal map\nwHq (z) =\n\nu1 (z)\nu2 (z)\n\nwith u1 (z) and u2 (z) defined in (23).\n\nIII.\n\nINVARIANT OF 3-STRAND BRAIDS\n\nLet us return to the model of random braids discussed in the very beginning of the paper. The system of three\nindependently moving particles is described by 3 complex variables (i.e. 6 degrees of freedom) and hence our system\ncan not be directly viewed as a monodromy problem. In order to describe the whole system by one complex variable \u03b6\n\n\f9\nand to be able to use the tools elaborated in the previous section, with the minimal loss of information, we introduce\nthe anharmonic quotient:\n\u03b6(t) =\n\nz23 (t)\nz2 (t) \u2212 z3 (t)\n\u2261\nz13 (t)\nz1 (t) \u2212 z3 (t)\n\n(26)\n\nOne can easily check that the variable \u03b6 contains the complete topological information of a mutual configuration of\nthree entangled lines, except the global phase, or global twist of the braid. It means that we do not take into account\nthe center of B3 considering the factor group P SL(2, Z) = B3 /Z. We can always take into account the global twist\nafterwards by passing to the rotating coordinate system with the origin located in the center of mass of the system\nof three particles. From the statistical point of view the possibility of neglecting the center of B3 (which is equivalent\nto considering the factor group P SL(2, Z) only), has been discussed in the papers [18, 19]. In fact, in these paper it\nhas been shown that the escape rates for random walks on B3 and P SL(2, Z) are the same in the limit of infinitely\nlong trajectories.\nThus, the parametrization of the three-particle system {z1 (t), z2 (t), z3 (t)} by the function \u03b6(t) living in the doubly\npunctured complex plane enables us to preserve all topological characteristics of the braid of mutually entangled world\nlines of these particles. However the precise derivation of the expression for the flat connection, as it is shown below,\nexplicitly depends on the fact whether the particles are identical or not.\nLooking at the elementary moves associated with the generators \u03c31 , \u03c32 of B3 , we obtain the transformations for\nthe variable \u03b6. For example, let us pick up some path in the homotopy class of \u03c31 (see fig.1). By definition of \u03c31 , we\nhave at some time t:\n\uf8f1\nz1 + z2\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nz1 (t) =\n+ z12 e\u2212i\u03c0t\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n2\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(27)\n\u03c31 [z1 \u2194 z2 , z3 \u2194 z3 ] : z (t) = z1 + z2 \u2212 1 z e\u2212i\u03c0t\n12\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 2\n2\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 z (t) = z\n3\n\n3\n\nIn the same way we can get the transformation of \u03b6 along a path corresponding to the homotopy class \u03c32 \u2261 \u03c32 [z1 \u2194\nz1 , z2 \u2194 z3 ]. Finally we arrive at the following set of transformations of \u03b6:\n1\n\u03b6\n\u03b6\n\u03c32 : \u03b6 \u2192\n\u03b6 \u22121\n\n\u03c31 : \u03b6 \u2192\n\n(28)\n\nwhich precisely define the representation of the symmetric group S3 .\nIndistinguishable particles. Our main goal consists in constructing the flat connection for the system of three\nidentical particles moving in the plane. The condition of the indistinguishability of particles requires to factor the\naction of the group B3 by S3 , and hence to consider \u03b6 as living in the factor space C\u22c6\u22c6 /S3 . The case of distinguishable\nparticles shall be discussed at the end of this section.\nAll the trajectories \u03b6(t) (parameterized by t) are obviously closed in the space C\u22c6\u22c6 /S3 . Keeping in mind our strategy\nof the previous section, we want to define a monodromy representation of B3 (more precisely of P SL(2, Z)) acting on\nC\u22c6\u22c6 /S3 . To do that we construct a conformal map ws (\u03b6) of the doubly punctured plane factorized over the action of\nthe symmetric group, C\u22c6\u22c6 /S3 onto the fundamental domain of the modular group, P SL(2, Z):\nws (\u03b6) : C\u22c6\u22c6 /S3 \u2212\u2192 P SL(2, Z)\n\n(29)\n\nTo our knowledge, the explicit method of solving the uniformization problem (29) has not been yet considered in\nthe context of our problem. So, our own way to tackle it deals with the following observation.\n\n\f10\nConsider the so-called pure braid group P3 defined as follows:\nP3 = h\u03c312 , \u03c322 , (\u03c31 \u03c32 )2 i\n\n(30)\n\nIt is obvious that the group P3 is the subgroup of B3 . In particular, the group P3 can be identified with the factor\ngroup F2 \u00d7 Z through the obvious correspondence\n\u03c312 = g1 , \u03c312 = g1\n\n(31)\n\nwhere g1 and g2 are the generators of the free group F2 . The relations (14) follow from the Burau representation of\nbraid group generators (1) and the obvious geometric construction shown in the fig.4.\n\nFIG. 4: The squares of the braid group generators \u03c3i act as the free group generators gi : gi = \u03c3i2 (i = 1, 2).\n\nIn the case of the pure braid group P3 there is no difference between distinguishable and indistinguishable particles\nmoving in the plane z because the generators g1 and g2 correspond to \"full turns\" of one world line of the particle\nwith respect to another one (and not to \"half turns\" as in case of the braid group B3 ). That is, we deal with the\nmonodromy representation of F2 . Let us remind that we factor out the global turns (i.e. the center of the group) in\nthe space C\u22c6\u22c6 . The uniformization problem in this case is solved by the conformal map ws (\u03b6) of the doubly punctured\nplane to the covering space\nws (\u03b6) : C\u22c6\u22c6 \u2212\u2192 F2\nThus, we return to the topic of the previous section, where an explicit form of such conformal map ws (\u03b6) \u2261 w(\u03b6) is\ngiven in (17).\nConsider now the whole group B3 /Z, take the same function w(\u03b6) and check the effect of the basic substitutions of\nthe symmetric group (28) onto the transformations of w(\u03b6). Using the well known properties of the modular functions\n(see, for example, [20, 21, 22]), we get:\n\uf8f1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2192 \u2212ws + 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 ws \u03b6 \u2192 \u03b6\n(32)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8f4\nw\n\u03b6\n\uf8f4\ns\n\uf8f4\n\u2192\n\uf8f3 ws \u03b6 \u2192\n\u03b6 \u22121\nws \u2212 1\n\nThe transformations of ws precisely coincide with the basic transformations of the modular group P SL(2, Z). In fact,\n\u03b824 (0,ws )\ntechnically it is much easier to check (instead of (32)) the transformations for the inverse function \u03b6(ws ) = \u03b8(0,w\n:\ns)\n\uf8f1\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b6 (ws \u2192 \u2212ws + 1) \u2192\n\u03b6\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8f4\n\u03b6\nws\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03b6 ws \u2192\n\u2192\nws \u2212 1\n\u03b6 \u22121\n\n(33)\n\nHence the function ws (\u03b6) explicitly solves the desired uniformization problem (29). Thus, we can use this function\nws (\u03b6) to construct the non-Abelian flat connection As (\u03b6) for the trajectories on C\u22c6\u22c6 /S3 parametrized by \u03b6(t):\nAs (\u03b6) =\n\ndws (\u03b6)\nd\u03b6\n\n(34)\n\n\f11\nwhere\nws (\u03b6) \u2261 w(\u03b6) =\n\nu1 (\u03b6)\nF (1/2, 1/2, 1, z)\n= \u2212i\nu2 (\u03b6)\nF (1/2, 1/2, 1, 1 \u2212 z)\n\n(see eq.(15)).\nThe expression (34) is the source for the explicit construction of the topological invariant via equation (6) of three\nentangled world lines z1 (t), z2 (t) and z3 (t) shown in fig.1.\nDistinguishable particles. For distinguishable particles the action of the symmetric group S3 should be neglected\nand hence \u03b6 is living in the doubly punctured plane, C\u22c6\u22c6 . The problem of uniformization in this case is solved by the\nconformal map wd (\u03b6) mapping the doubly punctured plane, C\u22c6\u22c6 , onto the fundamental domain of the modular group,\nP SL(2, Z):\nwd (\u03b6) : C\u22c6\u22c6 \u2212\u2192 P SL(2, Z)\n(compare this expression to (29)). The corresponding function wd (\u03b6) coincides with w2 (\u03b6) =\nprivious section (use the equations (23)\u2013(24) for q = 3).\n\nIV.\n\n(35)\nu1 (\u03b6)\nu2 (\u03b6)\n\nfound in the\n\nSTOCHASTIC BEHAVIOR OF THE INVARIANT FOR BROWNIAN 3-STRAND BRAIDS\n\nWe are interested in this section in the stochastic behavior of the invariant |w(\u03b7)| when each of the three particles\nperform a 2D Brownian motion (BM) represented by its complex coordinate zi . This model naturally appears as\nthe generalization of the Edwards' problem of determining the distribution of the winding angle of two independent\n2D BM [5]. The intrinsic noncommutative structure of the 3\u2013particles model, contrary to the commutative 2\u2013\nparticles problem, induces a completely different behavior of the invariant, which characterizes quantitatively the\ntangle complexity. The method employed here is inspired by a work of Gruet [26].\n\nA.\n\nThe Ideal Model\n\nWe begin with an ideal case of point\u2013like particles diffusing in the infinite plane with the diffusion constants D set\nto 1. Following previous sections, one has to study the motion of the reduced variable \u03b7 in the space C\u22c6\u22c6 /S3 . Our\nstrategy relies on the following theorem on conformal transforms of complex BM often referred to as a generalized\nPaul L\u00e9vy's theorem [28]. Denote by Bt the generic BM in the complex plane z. For any conformal map f , the image\nYt = f (Bt ) of a BM Bt is a time changed BM Bu (t) such that\ndu =\n\n1\ndY d\u0232 = |f \u2032 (Bt )|2 dt\n4\n\n(36)\n\nIn terms of the diffusion equation (which corresponds to the Langevin equation (36), the time change can be interpreted\nas a space dependent diffusion coefficient [25]:\n\u2202t P (Yt ) =\n\ndu\n\u2206P (Yt )\ndt\n\n(37)\n\nA slightly modified version of the generalized L\u00e9vy theorem shows that \u03b6(t), being the ratio of two complex BM\n(see (26)), is also a time changed BM, denoted \u03b6(t) = Bu(t) . The time change then reads, following the rules of It\u00f4\ncalculus:\ndu =\n\n1 + |\u03b6(t)|2\n1\ndt\nd\u03b6d\u03b6\u0304 =\n4\n|z32 (t)|2\n\n(38)\n\n\f12\nNow we should pass to the covering space w and describe the evolution of the invariant w(\u03b6) = w(Bu ). Using\nonce more the generalized L\u00e9vy's theorem, we obtain that there exists a hyperbolic BM B\u0303 such that w(\u03b6) is again a\ntime\u2013changed B\u0303:\nw(\u03b6(t)) = B\u0303\u03c4 (u(t))\n\n(39)\n\nwith\n|w\u2032 (Bu )|2\ndu\nIm2 (w(Bu ))\n\nd\u03c4 =\n\n(40)\n\nThe choice of the hyperbolic metric is not artificial and anticipates the geometrical properties of the transform w(\u03b6).\nNote the importance of obtained result: we know that the topological invariant w(\u03b6), giving the braid complexity,\nperforms a hyperbolic diffusion in a new time, or equivalently a hyperbolic diffusion in a space with the metric\u2013\ndependent diffusion coefficient. We now have to study the full time change \u03c4 (t). Combining (38) and (40) and using\nthe well known inverse function w\u22121 \u2261 z(w) = \u03bb(w) (see (18)), we obtain after separating the variables the following\nimplicit relation between t and \u03c4 , which defines the functional Ht (\u03c4 ):\nZ t\nZ \u03c4\ndt\u2032\n|\u03bb\u2032 (B\u0303\u03c4 \u2032 )|2\nHt (\u03c4 ) =\n(41)\nIm2 (B\u0303\u03c4 \u2032 )d\u03c4 \u2032\n=\n\u2032\n2\n2\n|z\n(t\n)|\n\u2032\n1\n+\n|\u03bb(\nB\u0303\n)|\n32\n0\n0\n\u03c4\nThis expression is exact, but does not allow a straightforward interpretation. Let us first notice that the t\u2013dependence\ncan be easily shown to be, with the probability one:\nlim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nHt (\u03c4 )\n= C1 > 0\nln t\n\n(42)\n\nThe sensitive point is the \u03c4 \u2013dependence. The integral kernel f\nf : z \u2212\u2192\n\n|\u03bb\u2032 (z)|2\nIm2 (z)\n1 + |\u03bb(z)|2\n\n(43)\n\nis invariant under the transformations of the group F2 , and Ht (\u03c4 ) is therefore an additive functional of the BM on the\nquotient surface H/F2 . This motion is ergodic. Therefore if Ht (\u03c4 ) is integrable over the fundamental domain of F2 ,\none can clear up the asymptotic \u03c4 \u2013dependence (see in particular a similar approach proposed by Gruet in [26]). In\nour case Ht (\u03c4 ) is not integrable over the domain of F2 ; the \u03c4 \u2013dependence for this ideal model requires more attention\nand have to be treated with more care. We expect to consider that question in details separately, while below we\nexpress a conjecture based on the fact that the non-integrability does not lead to a growth faster than \u03c4 . We indeed\nbelieve that the non-integrability gives rise to sub-leading terms in \u03c4 and the following limit holds:\nlim\n\nHt (\u03c4 )\n= C2\n\u03c4\n\n(44)\n\nlim\n\nC1\n\u03c4 (t)\n=\nt\nC2\n\n(45)\n\n\u03c4 \u2192\u221e\n\nComparing (42) and (44) we arrive at the relation\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nUsing (45) we formulate a central result connecting the hyperbolic BM B\u0303\u03c4 describing the connection of the expectation of our topological invariant d(w) being the distance in the covering space w, with the word length L(B\u0303\u03c4 ) of\nthe corresponding random braid. Recall that the distribution of B\u0303\u03c4 is well known, and in particular,\nlim\n\n\u03c4 \u2192\u221e\n\nd(B\u0303\u03c4 )\n=1\n\u03c4\n\nalmost surely. Moreover, if one notices that the word lengths L for P SL(2, Z) and for F2 are quasi-isometric, we have:\n\nlim\n\n\u03c4 \u2192\u221e\n\nD\n\nE\nL(B\u0303\u03c4 )\n\u03c4 ln \u03c4\n\n= C3 > 0\n\nin probability\n\n(46)\n\n\f13\nwhat is a direct consequence of a theorem by Gruet proved in [26]. Combining this result with (45, we end up with\nthe following leading asymptotics at large time for the expectation of the word length of Brownian 3\u2013strand braids:\nhLt i \u223c ln(t) \u00d7 ln(ln t) for t \u2192 \u221e\n\n(47)\n\nThe average topological complexity increases with time, however the growth is very slow. It is limited (as in the\ncase of two particles where this logarithmic scaling also holds) by the angular part of the 2D BM in an infinite space\n[25, 27]: when two particles are far apart (and the corresponding typical distance grows with time), their relative\nangle varies very slowly.\n\nB.\n\nModel with a compact domain\n\nWe here discuss the physical reasons that justify a regularization of the integral (41) over the fundamental domain\nof F2 . The divergence of this integral occurs when \u03b7 approaches the points {0, 1, \u221e} meaning that either two particles\ncollide, or one particle goes to infinity. It is then quite natural to modify slightly the model in order to avoid these\npathological cases, which in fact are not realistic if one describes the physical objects of finite thickness such as\npolymers. Specifically, we assume that three Brownian particles evolve in a bounded domain of characteristic size R\nand that they experience hard-core repulsion at distance r. This can be re-expressed in terms of constraints due to\nhard walls added to the domain of \u03b7, hereafter denoted by D:\n\u01eb(r, R) \u2264 |\u03b7| \u2264 M (r, R)\n\n(48)\n\n|\u03b7(r, R) \u2212 1| \u2265 \u01eb\nThe precise shape of the boundary of D is not important. Note that w(D) is compact in H. Restricting our model\nto this domain, we can now claim the integrability of the functional HtD (\u03c4 ) over the domain w(D). Within this\napproximation, we obtain the following \u03c4 \u2013dependence from the ergodic property offered above:\nHtD (\u03c4 )\n= C4 > 0\n\u03c4 \u2192\u221e\n\u03c4\nlim\n\n(49)\n\nIn this model the t\u2013dependence is readily changed as follows:\nHtD (\u03c4 )\n= C5 > 0\nt\u2192\u221e\nt\nlim\n\n(50)\n\nComparing (49) and (50) we arrive at\nlim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nC4\n\u03c4 (t)\n=\nt\nC5\n\n(51)\n\nThe expectation of d(w) can now be described asymptotically: d(w) is a hyperbolic BM in the variable \u03c4 \u221d t (see\n(51)). In particular, we have with the probability one:\nlim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nhd(w(\u03b7))i\n= C6 > 0\nt\n\n(52)\n\nFor a compact domain one can straightforwardly check that the topological invariant, d, and the word length, L, are\nquasi-isometric. The asymptotic behavior of the expectation value of L is therefore similar to the one of hd(w(\u03b7))i:\n\u223ct\nLD\nt\n\nfor t \u2192 \u221e\n\n(53)\n\nFor the bounded domain, the topological complexity grows much faster, as the infinite space effect discussed above is\n\u221a\n\u221d t should be compared to the (commutative) scaling hLcomm i \u221d t for two particles. It\nabsent. The scaling LD\nt\nis noteworthy to stress that (53) is fully consistent with a discrete model considered in [18, 19].\n\n\f14\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo conclude, we would like to comment the new physical content of our results. So far the only topological invariant\nstudied in the context of entanglements of fluctuating linear objects was the so-called winding number [1, 2, 4, 6],\nwhich is known to be incomplete for more than two linear objects. We here propose a model, which describes exactly\nthe underlying non-Abelian topology of the problem.\nWe propose a simple geometrical construction of topological invariants of 3\u2013strand Brownian braids viewed as world\nlines of 3 particles performing independent Brownian motions in the complex plane z. Our construction is based on the\nproperties of conformal maps of doubly-punctured plane z to the universal covering surface. We pay special attention\nto the case of indistinguishable particles. Our approach is mainly \"self made\" and its geometrical transparency we\nconsider as the basic advantage. The standard machinery of constructing the nontrivial braid group representations\nfrom the Conformal Field Theory is outlined in the Appendix where we mainly review the strategy realized in [29].\nThe Appendix is added to our paper exclusively to establish some links between the approachs based on the geometry\nof conformal maps and on CFT.\nOur method of conformal maps allow us to investigate the statistical properties of the topological complexity of a\nbunch of 3\u2013strand Brownian braids and to compute the expectation value of the irreducible braid length.\n\nAPPENDIX A: BRAID GROUP REPRESENTATION AND CFT\n\nIn this section we try to describe the derivation of the braid group representation from the monodromies of some\nCFT. We will mainly describe the system under investigation in physical terms, rather than in more rigorous but less\ntransparent algebraic topological setting.\nSo, consider n (n = 3 shall be mainly treated) indistinguishable particles, living in the complex plane C. The \"static\"\n(or configurational) phase space is the following set Xn = Yn /Sn = C\u00d7Yn\u22121 /Sn where Yn = {z = (z1 , ..., zn ) \u2208 Cn ; i 6=\nj \u21d2 zi 6= zj } and Sn is the group of permutations of n elements. The above defined decomposition means that one can\nfactor out the coordinate of the center of mass of the system. Thus, we study the topology of Xn , or more precisely\nof its first homotopy group \u03c01 (Xn ), describing the classes of equivalence of closed curves on Xn where Bn = \u03c01 (Xn ).\nIn physical terms we can rephrase the said above as follows. A quantum mechanical description of this system\nrequires to define the wave functions, or in other words an n fold tensor\u2013valued functions \u03a8 : Xn \u2192 V \u2297n over this\nconfiguration space. These functions should represent the internal quantum numbers such as a spin for each particles.\nThe most general case consists in taking \u03a8 as the so-called G\u2013modules, where G is a Lie group. The obtained\nmulti\u2013valued (in fact, tensor\u2013valued) structure is called a fiber bundle. The main difficulty in such construction is as\nfollows: the functions \u03a8(z) and \u03a8(z\u2032 6= z) belong to different spaces, say hz and hz\u2032 , and therefore can not be directly\ncompared. To overcome this difficulty one has to define a map T\u03b3zz\u2032 : hz \u2192 hz\u2032 that \"transports\" the wave function\nfrom z to z\u2032 along the path \u03b3.\nNow let us define the holonomy operator, T\u03b3zz\u2032 , and a one\u2013form \u03c9 = dTzz , called \"flat connection\" over Xn . The\nimportant point is that the flatness of the connection\nd\u03c9 + \u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9 = 0\nis a necessary and sufficient condition for the holonomy group Pz at z to give rise to a monodromy representation of\nthe fundamental group \u03c01 (Xn ). Recall that the holonomy group is the group of T\u03b3zz of all closed paths \u03b3zz with the\nnatural path composition as an internal law. We are therefore lead by this statement to a study of flat connections\nover Xn .\nWhat is the physical meaning to be extracted from such consideration? The basic idea, put forward by the discovery\nof the non-Abelian Bohm\u2013Aharnov effect [31], is that a closed trajectory in the phase space can affect internal quantum\n\n\f15\nnumbers of the system giving rise to topological interaction which depend only on the homotopy class of this closed\npath. The flat connections usually considered in the literature are the following matrix valued 1\u2013forms, or the so-called\nKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) connections:\nX\n\u03c9 KZ =\n\u03a9ab d log zab\n(A1)\n1\u2264<a<b\u2264n\n\nwhere \u03a9ab \u2208 End(V \u2297n ) is the Casimir invariant (not explicitly written here), and zab = za \u2212 zb . The reader is referred\nto [30] for a more detailed description of this aspect. This connection was introduced in 2D conformal field theory in\nthe context of the Wess\u2013Zumino\u2013Novikov\u2013Witten model and is related to the study of chiral current algebras [32, 33].\nIn this model, a primary field is covariant under two kinds of transformations: local gauge transformations generated\nby the current J and conformal reparameterization generated by the stress-energy tensor T . These T and J are linked\nby the Sugawara formula describing consistency between two covariances, and leads hence to the KZ equation for an\nn\u2013points correlator \u03a8:\nh d\u03a8 = \u03c9\u03a8\n\n(A2)\n\nh being a complex parameter. This formulation suggests a geometric interpretation: \u03a8 is covariantly constant for\nthis connection. The equation (A2) being a first order linear differential equation, can be treated in the frameworks\nof the analytic theory of differential equations. Any solution of (A2) can be represented by a linear combination of\nits n \u2212 1 fundamental solutions. The formal (and in practice not very useful) description of the holonomy group:\nZ\n\u03c9 KZ\n(A3)\nT\u03b3zz = P exp\n\u03b3zz\n\nthen reduces to a matrix representation. It is shown in [33] that equation (A2) can\nin the case n = 3 to a\n\u0013\n\u0012 be reduced\nz23\ndefined by\nsystem of ordinary differential equations for the SU (N )\u2013invariant amplitude F \u03b7 =\nz13\n\u2212\n\n3\n\n\u03a8(z1 , z2 , z3 ) = z134h (\u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b7))\u2212\n\nN +1\nNh\n\nF (\u03b7)\n\n(A4)\n\nThis parameterization yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\nK12\nK23\nh\nF (\u03b7) = 0\n+\n\u2212\nd\u03b7\n1\u2212\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\n(A5)\n\nwhere K12 , K23 \u2208 End(V \u2297n ).
