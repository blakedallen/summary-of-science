Nat. nn(nnn):ww\u2013zzz,ddd-ddd de 2016\n\nIntroduction\nOne of the oldest and most important problems in galactic\ndynamics is the determination of the mass distribution based\non the observations of the circular velocity or rotation curve\n(Pierens and Hure, 2004), defined as the speed of the stars\nmoving in the galactic plane in circular orbits around the center. Now, if we assume a particular model for the composition\nof the galaxy, the fit of that model with the rotation curve of\na particular galaxy can, in principle, completely determine the\ndistribution of mass. So then, the rotation curve provides the\nmost direct method to measure the distribution of mass of a\ngalaxy (Binney and Tremaine, 2008).\nCurrently, the most accepted description of the composition\nof spiral galaxies is that a significant portion of its mass is\nconcentrated in a thin disc, while the other contributions to\nthe total mass of the galaxy come from a spherical halo of\ndark matter, a central bulge and, perhaps, a central black hole\n(Binney and Tremaine, 2008). Now, since all components\ncontribute to the gravitational field of the galaxy, obtaining\nappropriate models that include the effects of all parts is a\nproblem of great difficulty. However, the contribution of each\npart is limited to certain distance scales, so in a reasonably\nrealistic model it is not necessary to include the contribution\nof all components (Faber, 2006).\nIn particular, the gravitational influence of the central black\nhole is appreciable only within a few parsecs around the center\nof the galaxy (Sch\u00f6del et al., 2002), so it can be completely\nneglected when studying the dynamics of the disc, or in regions\noutside the central bulge, while the bulge mainly dominates\nthe inner region of the galaxy to a few kiloparsec. So then,\nthe main contributions to the gravitational field of the galaxy\ncome from the galactic disc and the dark matter halo (Faber,\n2006). However, it is commonly accepted that many aspects\nof galactic dynamics can be described, in a fairly approximate\nway, using models that consider only the contribution of a thin\ngalactic disc (Binney and Tremaine, 2008).\nAccordingly, the study of the gravitational potential generated\nby an idealized thin disc is a problem of great astrophysical relevance and so, through the years, different approaches\nhave been used to obtain such kind of thin disc models (see\nBinney and Tremaine (2008) and references therein). So,\nonce an expression for the gravitational potential has been derived, corresponding expressions for the surface mass density\nof the disc and for the circular velocity of the disc particles can\nbe obtained. Then, if the expression for the circular velocity\ncan be adjusted to fit the observational data of the rotation\n\n2\n\ncurve of a particular galaxy, the total mass can be obtained by\nintegrating the corresponding surface mass density.\nHowever, although most of these thin disc models have surface\ndensities and rotation curves with remarkable properties, many\nof them mainly represent discs of infinite extension and thus\nthey are rather poor flat galaxy models. Therefore, in order\nto obtain more realistic models of flat galaxies, it is better to\nconsider methods that permit obtaining finite thin disc models.\nNow, a simple method to obtain the gravitational potential, the\nsurface density and the rotation curve of thin discs of finite radius was developed by Hunter (1963), the simplest example of\na disc obtained by this method being the well known Kalnajs\n(1972) disc.\nIn a previous paper (Gonz\u00e1lez and Reina, 2006) we used\nthe Hunter method in order to obtain an infinite family of\nthin discs of finite radius with a well-behaved surface mass\ndensity. This family of disc models was derived by requiring that the surface density behaves as a monotonously decreasing function of the radius, with a maximum at the center of the disc and vanishing at the edge. Furthermore,\nthe motion of test particles in the gravitational fields generated by the first four members of this family was studied\nin Ramos-Caro, L\u00f3pez-Suspez and Gonz\u00e1lez (2008). So,\nalthough the mass distribution of this family of discs presents\na satisfactory behaviour in such a way that they could be considered adequate as flat galaxy models, their corresponding rotation curves do not present a so good behavior, as they do not\nreproduce the flat region of the observed rotation curve.\nOn the other hand, in Pedraza, Ramos-Caro and Gonz\u00e1lez\n(2008) a new family of discs was obtained as a superposition of\nmembers of the previously obtained family, by requiring that\nthe surface density be expressed as a well-behaved function of\nthe gravitational potential, in such a way that the corresponding distribution functions can be easily obtained. Furthermore,\nbesides presenting a well-behaved surface density, the models\nalso presented rotation curves with a better behavior than the\ngeneralized Kalnajs discs. However, although these discs are\nstable against small radial perturbations of disc star orbits,\nthey are unstable to small vertical perturbations normal to\nthe disc plane. Then, apart from the stability problems, these\ndiscs can be considered as quite adequate models in order to\nsatisfactorily describe a great variety of galaxies.\nBased on these works, in Gonz\u00e1lez, Plata-Plata and Ramos-Caro\n(2010) were obtained some thin disc models in which the circular velocities were adjusted to very accurately fit the observed\nrotation curves of four spiral galaxies of the Ursa Major cluster, galaxies NGC3877, NGC3917, NGC3949 and NGC4010.\n\n\fRev. Acad. Colomb. Cienc. Ex. Fis. Nat. nn(nnn):ww\u2013zzz,ddd-ddd de 2016\n\nThese models presented well-behaved surface densities and the\nobtained values for the corresponding total mass agree with\nthe expected order of magnitude. However, the models presented a central region with strong instability to small vertical\nperturbations. Now, this result was expected as a consequence\nof the fact that the models only consider the thin galactic\ndisc. Therefore, more realistic models must be considered including the non-thin character of the galactic disc or the mass\ncontribution of the spheroidal halo.\nIn agreement with the above considerations, in this paper we\nwill consider a family of models obtained by expressing the\ngravitational potential as the superposition of a potential generated by the thin galactic disc and a potential generated by the\nspheroidal halo, in such a way that the model implies a linear\nrelationship between the masses of the thin disc and the spheroidal halo. By adjusting the corresponding expression for the\ncircular velocity to the observed data of the rotation curve of\nsome specific galaxies, some particular models will be analysed.\nThen, from the corresponding expressions for the disc surface\ndensity and the density of the halo, estimate values for the total\nmass of the disc and the total mass of the halo will be obtained.\nThe paper is organised as follows. First we present the thin disc\nplus halo model. Then, we obtain the corresponding expressions for particular models, and then the models are fitted to\ndata of the observed rotation curve of some galaxies of the Ursa\nMayor Cluster, as reported in Verheijen ans Sancisi (2001).\nFinally, we discuss the obtained results.\n\nIn order to obtain galaxy models consisting of a thin galactic disc and a spheroidal halo, we begin considering an axially\nsymmetric gravitational potential \u03a6 = \u03a6(R, z), where (R, \u03c6, z)\nare the usual cylindrical coordinates. Also, besides the axial\nsymmetry, we suppose that the potential has symmetry of reflection with respect to the plane z = 0,\n(1)\n\nwhich implies that the normal derivative of the potential satisfies the relation\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u2202\u03a6\n(R, \u2212z) = \u2212\n(R, z),\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\nOn the other hand, in order to separately describe the thin disc\nand the spheroidal halo, we consider that the gravitational potential can be written as the superposition of two independent\ncomponents\n\u03a6(R, z) = \u03a6d (R, z) + \u03a6h (R, z),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a6d (R, z) is the part of the potential generated by the thin\ngalactic disc, while \u03a6h (R, z) corresponds to the spheroidal halo\ncomponent. The disc component \u03a6d (R, z) must be a solution\nof the Laplace equation everywhere outside the disc,\n\u22072 \u03a6d = 0,\n\n(4)\n\nwhile the halo component \u03a6h (R, z) satisfies the Poisson equation\n\u22072 \u03a6h = 4\u03c0G\u033a,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u033a(R, z) is the mass density of the halo.\nSo, given a potential \u03a6(R, z) with the previous properties, we\ncan easily obtain the circular velocity vc (R), defined as the velocity of the stars moving at the galactic disc in circular orbits\naround the center, through the relationship\nvc2 (R) = R\n\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u2202R\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nz=0\n\nwhile the surface mass density \u03a3(R) of the thin galactic disc is\ngiven by\n1 \u2202\u03a6\n,\n(7)\n\u03a3(R) =\n2\u03c0G \u2202z z=0+\nwhich it is obtained by using the Gauss law and the reflection\nsymmetry of \u03a6(R, z).\n\nThe Thin Disc Plus Halo Model\n\n\u03a6(R, z) = \u03a6(R, \u2212z),\n\nAnalytical Potentials for Flat Galaxies with Spheroidal Halos\n\n(2)\n\nin agreement with the attractive character of the gravitational\nfield. We also assume that \u2202\u03a6/\u2202z does not vanish on the plane\nz = 0, in order to have a thin distribution of matter that represents the disc.\n\nAccordingly, in order that the potential of the spheroidal halo\ndoes not contribute to the disc surface density, we will impose\nthe condition\n\u2202\u03a6h\n= 0.\n(8)\n\u2202z z=0+\nFurthermore, in order to have a surface density corresponding\nto a finite disclike distribution of matter, we impose boundary\nconditions in the form\n\u2202\u03a6d\n\u2202z\n\nz=0+\n\n\u2202\u03a6d\n\u2202z\n\nz=0+\n\n6= 0;\n\nR \u2264 a,\n\n(9a)\n\n= 0;\n\nR > a,\n\n(9b)\n\nin such a way that the matter distribution is restricted to the\ndisc z = 0, 0 \u2264 R \u2264 a, where a is the radius of the disc.\nIn order to properly pose the boundary value problem, we introduce the oblate spheroidal coordinates, whose symmetry adapts\n\n3\n\n\fG.

So, in order to restrict the allowed values of these masses,\nit is needed to analyse the behaviour of some other quantities characterizing the kinematics of the model. These features\nare the epicycle or radial frequency, \u03ba2 (R), and the vertical\nfrequency, \u03bd 2 (R), which describe the stability against radial\nand vertical perturbations of particles in quasi-circular orbits\n(Binney and Tremaine, 2008).

So, we will adjust\nconstants C\nthese constants in such a way that the circular velocity\ne fits with the data of the rotation curve of some\nvc2 (R)\nparticular galaxy. As expression (33) for the circular velocity only involves derivatives of the Legendre polynomials of even order, it can be written as the rotation law\n(Gonz\u00e1lez, Plata-Plata and Ramos-Caro, 2010)\ne =\nvc2 (R)\n\nm\nX\nl=1\n\ne 2l ,\nA2l R\n\n(37)\n\nwhere the A2l constants are related with the previous constants\ne2l , for l 6= 0, through the relation\nC\nwhere\n\ne2l =\nC\n\nIkl =\n\nm\n4l + 1 X\nA2k Ikl ,\n4l(2l + 1)\n\n(38)\n\n\u03ba2 (R) =\n\nZ\n\n(39)\n\nwhich is obtained by equaling expressions (33) and (37) and by\nusing the orthogonality properties of the associated Legendre\nfunctions (Arfken and Weber, 2005).\nThen, if the constants A2l are determined by a fitting of the\nobservational data of the corresponding rotation curve, the core2l can be determined by\nresponding values of the coefficients C\nmeans of relation (38), obtaining then a particular case of (36)\ncorresponding to a specific galaxy model, which can be written\nin terms of the constants A2l as\nm\nX\nMd G\n(\u22121)l+1 (4l + 1)A2k Ikl\nMh G\n+\n=\n\u2212 42B42 .

We pick the corresponding data out from Table 4 of\nthe paper by Verheijen ans Sancisi (2001), which presents\nthe results of an extensive 21 cm-line synthesis imaging survey\nof 41 galaxies in the nearby of the Ursa Major cluster using\nthe Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. The mean distance\nbetween this telescope and the cluster is 18.6 Mpc. At this\ndistance, 1 arcmin corresponds to 5.4 kpc.\nFor each rotation curve data, we take as the value of a, the\nvalue given by the last tabulated radius, i.e. we are assuming\nthat the radius of each galaxy is defined by its corresponding\n\nAnalytical Potentials for Flat Galaxies with Spheroidal Halos\n\nlast observed value. Although this assumption about the galactic radius do not agrees with the accepted standard about the\nedge of the stellar disc (Binney and Merrifield, 1998), we\nwill make it since we are assuming that all the stars moving in\ncircular orbits at the galactic plane are inside the disc and that\nthere are no stars moving outside the disc. Thereafter we take\nthe radii normalized in units of a to fit the rotation curve of\nevery galaxy by mean of the model (37).\nThe fits are made through a non-linear least squares fitting\nusing the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, implemented internally by ROOT version 5.28 (Brun and Rademakers, 1997),\nwhich minimizes the weighted sum of squares of deviations\nbetween the fit and the data. We assigned weights to the\ndata points inversely proportional to the square of their errors. These errors corresponding to 2v\u2206v being \u2206v the galaxy\nvelocity measurement error. For each galaxy, initially we look\nfor all the possible fits starting at m = 1 up to m = N \u2212 1,\nwith N the number of measured data pairs (R, v 2 ), hence we\nfind a value for m such that we get the minimum reduced chi\nsquare \u03c72r (the best fit). Now we can discard the galaxies that\ndo not pass the reduced chi squared test with a confidence level\nof 95% (Bevington and Keith, 2003).\ne2l constants are calculated by using the relations (19),\nThe C\n(35) and (38). Therefore, by using this set of constants in\n(49) and (52) we find for each galaxy the functions f1 and\nf2 . Finally, through a routine made in Mathematica 8.0., we\ncheck for each galaxy of the sample the validity of the condition\n(55). However, when we check the consistency of the adjust,\nwe found that only the fit of the data for the galaxies NGC4389\nand UGC6969 it agrees with these conditions, whereas that for\nall the other galaxies we found that the solution interval for\nMh and B42 , given by (55), is empty.\n\nTable 1.

Nat. nn(nnn):ww\u2013zzz,ddd-ddd de 2016\n\nConcluding Remarks\nWe have presented a family of analytical potentials for flat\ngalaxies with spheroidal halos characterised by a linear relationship between the halo mass and the disc mass. The models are stable against radial and vertical perturbations, and\ntheir circular velocities can be adjusted very accurately to the\nobserved rotation curves of some specific galaxies. The here\npresented models are a generalisation of the models presented\nin Gonz\u00e1lez, Plata-Plata and Ramos-Caro (2010), where\nonly models with a thin galactic disc are considered. The generalisation was obtained by adding to the gravitational potential\nof the thin disc the gravitational potential corresponding to a\nspheroidal halo, in such a way that we have solved the problem\nof vertical unstability presented by the previous models.\nTwo particular models were obtained by a numerical fit of the\ngeneral expression (37) for the circular velocity with the observed data of the rotation curve of galaxies NGC4389 and\nUGC6969. For these two galaxies we have obtained a fairly accurate numerical adjustment with the rotation curve and, from\nthe constants A2l obtained with the numerical fit, we compute\nthe values of the halo mass, the disc mass and the total mass for\nthese two galaxies in such a way that we obtain a very narrow\ninterval of values for these quantities. Furthermore, the values\nof masses here obtained are in agreement with the expected order of magnitude, between about 108 and 1012 M\u2299 , and with\nthe relative order of magnitude between the halo mass and the\ndisc mass, Md /Mh \u2248 0.1, (Ashman, 1990). Accordingly, we\nbelieve that the values of mass obtained for the two studied\ngalaxies may be taken as a very accurate estimate of the upper\nand lower bounds for the mass of the galactic disc and for the\nmass of the spheroidal halo in these two galaxies. Additionally,\nthe density profiles obtained satisfy several conditions which\nare necessary to describe real galactic systems, i.e. they are\ne z, taking\npositive and not have discontinuities in all range R,\na maximum value at center and smoothly decreasing its value\ne \u2192 \u221e.\nto zero when R\nHowever,\nalthough we tested the applicability of\nthe present model with all the galaxies reported by\nVerheijen ans Sancisi (2001), consistent models were obtained only for the two galaxies NGC4389 and UGC6969,\nwhereas for all the other galaxies were obtained models with\nvalues of the halo mass such that the condition (55) is not\nsatisfied. Now, it can be considered that this result occurs as\na consequence of the simple halo model that we have taken\nhere. Indeed, as we can see from expressions (26) and (27),\nonly one term of the gravitational potential of the halo contributes to their density, what leaves only one free constant to\n\n12\n\nbe determined in order to fit the model to the imposed consistency conditions. This constant is precisely the mass of the\nhalo, Mh , which is determined by requiring the positiveness\nof the vertical frequency and the surface mass density. On the\nother hand, if we consider additional terms in expression (27)\nfor the halo potential, we will have new free parameters that\nperhaps allow to better adjust the model to properly describe\nthe behavior of other galaxies besides the two considered here.\nIn agreement with the above considerations, we can consider\nthe simple set of models here presented as a fairly good approximation to obtaining quite realistic models of galaxies. In particular, we believe that the values of mass obtained for the two\ngalaxies here studied may be taken as a very accurate estimate\nof the upper and lower bounds for the mass of the galactic disc\nand for the mass of the spheroidal halo in these two galaxies.\nAccordingly, we are now working on a more involved model,\nobtained by including additional terms in expression (27) for\nthe halo potential, in order to get some particular models that\ncan be properly adjusted with the observed data of the rotation\ncurve of some other galaxies besides the two here considered.\nAcknowledgments.
