These older ejecta trace the mass-loss history of \u03b7 Car, and\nmay offer clues to its evolutionary state and the nature of its stellar wind before the Great Eruption.\nAt what separation from the star can material no longer be attributed directly to ejecta from \u03b7 Car\nor the influence of its stellar wind? Bohigas et al. (2000) have proposed the existence of an old bipolar\nshell ejected by \u03b7 Car, and Smith (2002a) presented circumstantial evidence that the shape of the Keyhole\nnebula may have been influenced by \u03b7 Car's wind. If enhanced mass loss occurred during a luminous blue\nvariable (LBV) phase that lasted \u223c105 yr with v\u221e \u2243500 km s\u22121 , for example, then the products of \u03b7 Car's\noutbursts may potentially be seen 1\u25e6 away or more (\u223c50 pc). Before reaching such distances, however,\nejecta from \u03b7 Car interact with stellar winds and radiation from several of the other luminous early-type\nstars in the Carina nebula (e.g., Walborn 1973, 1995; Feinstein 1995). This interaction might make the\nmaterial unrecognizable as stellar ejecta from \u03b7 Car on dynamical grounds, leaving chemical abundances of\nthe diluted material as the only potential diagnostic.\nSmith & Morse (2004) presented spectra of the outer ejecta of \u03b7 Car, showing that while ejecta immediately outside the Homunculus were already known to be nitrogen rich and severely depleted of oxygen\n(Davidson et al. 1982; Dufour et al. 1997), [O ii] and [O iii] lines became stronger with increasing separation\nfrom the star. In that paper we proposed that the nitrogen rich condensations ejected at high speed by \u03b7 Car\nare overtaking a normal-composition \"cocoon\" deposited by previous stellar-wind mass loss, and that this\ninteraction gives rise to the soft X-ray shell around \u03b7 Car (Corcoran et al. 1995, 1999, 2004; Seward et al.\n2001; Weis et al. 2004). In this paper we present [O iii] images of \u03b7 Car's environment, which we interpret\nas confirmation of this scenario.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nWe obtained images of \u03b7 Car, the Keyhole, and portions of the surrounding Carina nebula with 0.\u2032\u2032 8\nseeing on 2003 March 10 using the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) 4m telescope. The\n8192\u00d78192 pixel imager MOSAIC2, which has a 2\u00d74 array of 2048\u00d74096 pixel CCDs, provided a 35.\u2032 4 field\nof view with a pixel scale of 0.\u2032\u2032 26. The images reported here were obtained with a narrowband (\u223c80 \u00c5-wide)\nfilter centered on [O iii] \u03bb5007. Several individual 60 sec exposures were obtained with slight positional\noffsets to fill the inter-chip gaps and to correct for severe CCD blooming by \u03b7 Car, with a total exposure\ntime of 300 sec over most of the observed area. Images were reduced in the standard fashion with the\nMSCRED package in IRAF, and absolute sky coordinates were computed with reference to USNO catalog\nstars. A section of the CTIO image showing the environment around \u03b7 Car is displayed in Figure 1.\nWe also observed \u03b7 Car on 2003 August 8 (program GO-9775) with the Wide Field Planetary Camera\n2 (WFPC2) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) through the F502N filter to capture [O iii] \u03bb5007\nemission from the circumstellar environment. We compared these data with similar F502N images from the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nHST archive obtained on 1993 December 31 to search for temporal flux variations and proper motions of\nnebular structures. Table 1 contains a log of the WFPC2 F502N observations. Each data set consisted of\nseveral individual exposures with a range of integration times. All observations had \u03b7 Car centered on the\nWF3 chip. We used the shorter exposures to patch pixels that were saturated or affected by bleeding from\nthe bright central star of \u03b7 Car in longer exposures. We combined multiple exposures to reject cosmic rays,\nas we have done with our previous HST imaging of \u03b7 Car (Morse et al. 1998, 2001; Smith et al. 2000, 2004),\nand we corrected the images for the geometric distortion of the WFPC2 instrument using standard routines\nin IRAF/STSDAS. Since we are interested in examining proper motions of nebular features over the \u223c10 yr\ninterval between the two observations, we needed to carefully register the two epochs. Simple alignment with\nrotation and mosaicing using the WMOSAIC task in STSDAS does not give sufficiently accurate registration,\nso we used \u223c15 field stars as tie points to establish a common coordinate frame (see also Morse et al. 1998,\n2001; Fesen et al. 2001). Using a second-order polynomial fit, the images were aligned to \u223c0.1 pixel rms.\nThe final F502N images from 1993 and 2003 are shown in Figure 2.\n\n3.\n\nTHE [O iii] VEIL\n\nFigure 1 shows the environment around \u03b7 Car in [O iii] \u03bb5007, revealing different morphology from\nthat seen in other emission line tracers like [N ii] (e.g., Thackeray 1949, 1950; Gaviola 1950; Walborn 1976;\nMeaburn et al. 1987, 1993, 1996; Morse et al. 1998; Weis 2001). Instead of the dense knots and filaments\nof the nitrogen-rich outer ejecta, Figure 1 shows a thin limb-brightened veil of [O iii] emission encasing the\nHomunculus with a radius of about 30\u201340\u2032\u2032.1 This veil has a thin, limb-brightened outer edge best seen\nnorthwest of the Homunculus, especially in HST images of the same emission line (Fig. 2). The difference\nbetween [O iii] and [N ii] emission is striking in the color representation of Figure 3. No clear outer edge to\nthe [O iii] veil is seen south of the Homunculus, which is probably related to the lack of soft X-ray emission\nin that direction (Seward et al. 2001). The southern part of the veil may also be missing because of a lack\nof ionizing photons (see below).\nSmith & Morse (2004) proposed the existence of a normal-composition \"cocoon\" surrounding \u03b7 Car;\nas the nitrogen-rich outer ejecta run into this cocoon, their chemical abundances are modified to include\nvarying amounts of oxygen. Independent from its excitation mechanism, the [O iii] emission in Figures 1 and\n2 indicates a smooth distribution of gas with a significant amount of oxygen and with a different morphology\nfrom that of the nitrogen-rich ejecta (see Fig. 3b). This indicates that there is indeed oxygen surrounding\nthe outer ejecta, confirming the existence of the \"cocoon\".\nFigure 1 also shows a larger shell structure, seen as a thin filament adjoining the southeastern corner of\nthe \"veil\", extending toward the east for about 1.\u2032 5, and then turning northward and looping back toward\nthe Keyhole nebula. Part of this shell structure was seen by Bohigas et al. (2000), but they interpreted this\nas part of a large bipolar structure with a polar axis running northeast to southwest \u2013 perpendicular to that\nof the Homunculus. This bipolar shape is not confirmed by our new images. In our higher resolution image,\nthis structure gives the impression of an expanding bubble whose progress was thwarted toward the south by\nthe ejecta around \u03b7 Car; it looks as though a veil were draped over the Homunculus as \u03b7 Car and its dense\nejecta punch into the shell. This shell and veil may mark the interaction of stellar winds and dense ejecta.\nInterestingly, the very hot and massive O4 V((f)) star HD 303308 (Walborn 1973; Walborn et al. 2002),\n1 While the S Condensation, the S Ridge, and the NN \"jet\" are seen clearly in Figure 1, this is due to starlight scattered by\ndust, since these features show no detectable [O iii] emission in spectra (Smith & Morse 2004).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nwhich should have a powerful stellar wind and strong UV radiation, is seen projected inside this bubble.\nHD 303308 may be partly responsible for the appearance of this shell, as noted by Bohigas et al. (2000).\nDespite being one of the most luminous stars in the Galaxy, \u03b7 Car itself is a pitiful source of ionizing radiation\nbecause its dense stellar wind and the dusty Homunculus nebula trap the UV output of the central star.\nHowever, O++ requires a significant flux of photons above 54 eV. Thus, the [O iii] emission in Figure 1\nrequires some other source for its ionization and excitation. [O iii] emission is brightest on the northern side\nof the cocoon around \u03b7 Car, pointing toward radiation or the stellar wind from HD 303308 as the most likely\nculprit. Shocks could excite the [O iii] line, but this is unlikely due to the slow velocity of the veil, unless\nit is a standing shock (see below). Furthermore, optical spectra of the \"W Arc\" (the thin filament at the\nwestern edge of the veil around \u03b7 Car; Smith & Morse 2004) and part of the distant [O iii] shell (Bohigas\net al. 2000) show line ratios typical of photoionized gas in an H ii region, but with higher densities than\nsurrounding regions of the Carina nebula.\nEven if the [O iii] emission is not currently dominated by shock excitation, the veil in Figures 1 and 2\nmay trace a photoionized density enhancement or contact discontinuity in a standing shock front, resulting\nfrom the interaction of dense ejecta and a stellar wind. For example, suppose that leading up to the\nGreat Eruption in the 1840's (or more likely, leading up to the last major eruption before the 19th century\noutburst) \u03b7 Car had a dense stellar wind, comparable to its extreme present-day wind but with roughly\nsolar composition. This would be the case for the stellar wind before CNO ashes first made their way to the\nsurface of the star. At some point, this dense wind would interact with the faster and more rarefied stellar\nwinds from massive O-type stars in the Trumpler 16 cluster, like HD 303308. If this scenario applies, then\nthe [O iii] veil seen in Figures 1 and 2 is the terminal shock, or \"astropause\" of \u03b7 Car's stellar wind.2\n\n4.\n\nHST IMAGES AND PROPER MOTIONS\n\nIn addition to showing the structure of the [O iii] veil in more detail than ground-based images, our\nmulti-epoch HST images taken with the same filter and instrument can also constrain the motion of the shell.\nWith a time baseline between the 1993 and 2003 WFPC2 images of 9.6 yr, we can measure the positions of\nnebular features to an accuracy of 10-20% of a WF pixel (0.\u2032\u2032 1), sensitive to motion comparable to the sound\nspeed in ionized gas.\nAn efficient way to search for movement is to subtract registered frames at two epochs (e.g., Morse et\nal. 2001), so that moving condensations show adjacent light and dark features. This is shown in Figure 3a\nfor the WF3 images in the F502N filter. The expansion of the Homunculus is clear in Figure 3a, as is the\nmovement of the NN jet and S condensation. In all three of these cases, the moving material is fast (v > 100\nkm s\u22121 ) and is seen as dust-scattered continuum light in the F502N filter, instead of [O iii] emission. Figure\n3a shows no sign of proper motion in the veil, where all the thin filamentary [O iii] emission has subtracted\nto better than the residual noise. We find essentially no detectable motion nor surface brightness variation\nof the [O iii] veil during the \u223c10 yr time interval. The lack of any discernable proper motion is obvious when\none blinks between the images at the two epochs on a computer monitor. If the outer veil is expanding at\nall, it is moving very slowly compared to the ejecta closer to \u03b7 Car.\nFigure 4 shows an example of intensity tracings through the W Arc in the 1993 and 2003 F502N images.\n2 We\n\nuse the term \"astropause\", not to imply any similarity to the physical conditions of the heliopause in our solar system,\nbut simply to denote that this is the farthest outer boundary of \u03b7 Car's undiluted stellar wind.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThe limb-brightened edge of the W Arc corresponds to the strong feature at \u223c33\u2032\u2032 from the star (see Fig.\n2b). Again, the [O iii] veil shows no proper motion. To quantify this, we measured the positions of the\nW Arc at both epochs from the tracings in Figure 4 using five different methods: a flux-weighted centroid,\ncross-correlation, and Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt profile fits. We measured proper motion of +11\u00b112\nmas, or a tangential velocity of 12\u00b113 km s\u22121 away from the star in the plane of the sky for a distance of\n2250 kpc (Smith 2002b). This measurement uncertainty is comparable to the uncertainty in the registration\nof the two images, confirming that we do not detect any significant motion of the [O iii] veil. The dynamical\nage of the [O iii] veil is at least 3\u00d7104 yr, but the true age of the veil could obviously be less if it has\ndecelerated from its initial speed. Thus, our data give little information on the actual age and origin of the\n[O iii] veil, except that it is consistent with being the dense swept-up wind lost during a pre-outburst LBV\nphase.\nThe slow motion of the [O iii] veil also gives important clues about its excitation mechanism. Its speed\nmust be close to the sound speed in ionized gas. Shock velocities &100 km s\u22121 are normally required to\naccount for [O iii] emission (e.g., Hartigan et al. 1999), implying that the veil is dominated by photoionization.\nThe exception to this would be a stationary standing shock in colliding winds, but this would only make\nsense in the region directly between \u03b7 Car and HD 303308, not on the east and west sides of the veil.\nAdditionally, no X-ray emission has been reported from the region between \u03b7 Car and HD 303308, except for\nthe soft X-ray shell around \u03b7 Car, which is inside the veil. Thus, we conclude that the most likely excitation\nmechanism for the [O iii] veil is external UV irradiation by HD 303308.\n\n5.\n\nETA CAR'S MASS-LOSS HISTORY\n\nBased on spectra of several positions in \u03b7 Car's outer ejecta, we proposed a shift in the nebular abundance\npattern \u2013 from nitrogen-rich CNO ashes near the star to more normal composition material farther away\n\u2013 and we suggested that this is the result of nitrogen-rich ejecta running into slower normal-composition\nmaterial (Smith & Morse 2004). The [O iii] images we have presented here show a veil of bright oxygen\nemission, with a different and distinct morphology from that seen in nitrogen images (Fig. 3b); the [N ii]\ncondensations are found inside the boundaries of the [O iii] veil. We interpret this [O iii] emission as a strong\nconfirmation of the existence of the oxygen-bearing \"cocoon\" inferred from spectra.\nThe Great Eruption in the 1840's ejected about 10\u201315 M\u2299 of material off the star (Smith et al. 2003), and\n\u03b7 Car may have experienced similar mass-loss episodes before that event (Walborn et al 1978). If \u03b7 Car has\na mass of &100 M\u2299 appropriate for its luminosity, then these mass ejections constitute a significant fraction\nof the star's initial mass, and would have comprised most of the star's initial outer radius. Additionally, the\nmass lost during the Great Eruption is comparable to the total mass that was presumably lost in a normal\nstellar wind during the entire time that \u03b7 Car was on the main sequence (i.e. 10\u22126 to 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for\n\u223c3\u00d7106 yr). Thus, the removal of this mass in sudden outbursts may have stripped off the remaining outer\nlayers of the star, down to the convective core boundary where CNO-cycle ashes could be exposed. In that\ncase, it is perhaps not surprising to see a dramatic and rather sudden shift in chemical abundances in the\nextensive ejecta blanket around \u03b7 Car. The confirmation of the [O iii] cocoon in the images presented here\nunderscores our earlier speculation (Smith & Morse 2004) about possible connections between the change in\nabundances and instability that may accompany the transition from hydrogen to helium core burning.\nThe [O iii] veil marks the outer boundary of \u03b7 Car's undiluted ejecta envelope. All material inside the\nveil is ejecta from \u03b7 Carinae itself, whereas outside we find ambient material in the H ii region, stellar wind\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nmaterial from other O stars, or both of these mixed with \u03b7 Car's ancient main-sequence wind. In this sense,\nthe limb-brightened edge of the [O iii] veil is probably a contact discontinuity in the wind's terminal shock\n\u2013 i.e. it is the astropause of \u03b7 Car. This is not like the astropause for a normal star (like the heliopause)\nwhere the wind has never reached the interstellar medium beyond. The situation is also unlike the standard\ntheory for interstellar bubbles (i.e., Castor, McCray, & Weaver 1975), where the wind of a single massive\nstar blows a low-density bubble in a uniform surrounding medium, sweeping up a dense shell. Instead, the\nobserved structure around \u03b7 Car is the result of a dense slow wind expanding into a cavity created by its own\nprevious fast wind, and now being shaped from the outside by the fast lower-density wind of a nearby star.\nIndeed, Figure 1 gives the impression that the less dense wind and radiation from HD 303308 are sculpting\nthe surrounding cavity, halting the expansion of the [O iii] veil as adjacent ejecta from \u03b7 Car are swept\nback. This scenario has severe asymmetries and time-dependent mass-loss (\u03b7 Car entering the LBV phase,\nfollowed by multiple eruptions) that cannot be dealt with easily in the analytic framework of stellar wind\nbubbles. A better way to look at the problem may be from the point of view of pressure balance between\ntwo interacting stellar winds.\nThis astropause probably marks the limiting extent of a recent enhanced heavy mass-loss phase (i.e.\nthe LBV phase) for \u03b7 Car, which is now being eroded from the outside, whereas \u03b7 Car's main-sequence wind\nprobably filled much of the surrounding H ii region. If the [O iii] veil were produced by \u03b7 Car's main-sequence\nwind, it wouldn't have the high overdensity compared to the adjacent wind bubble of HD 303308; indeed, on\nthe main sequence, \u03b7 Car was probably like the O2 If* supergiant HD 93129A (Taresch et al. 1997; Simon\net al. 1983), and the wind would have been stronger than that of HD 303308. Instead, for the two winds\nto approximately balance with the much higher observed density on \u03b7 Car's side, it makes more sense for\n\u03b7 Car's wind to have filled the interior of the [O iii] veil with a slower and denser wind. The interface between\nthe winds should occur at the ram-pressure balance point between the two stars where \u03c11 v12 =\u03c12 v22 , given by\nR1\n=\nR2\n\ns\n\n\u1e401 v1\n,\n\u1e402 v2\n\nwhere R1 and R2 are the radial separations from each of the two stars. Using \u1e401 \u224310\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and\nv1 \u2243500 km s\u22121 as plausible values for \u03b7 Car's wind,3 and \u1e402 \u224310\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and v2 \u22433100 km s\u22121 as\nlikely values for the O4 V((f)) star HD 303308 (Repolust et al. 2004), we have R1 /R2 \u22439. This would\nbe much closer to HD 303308 than the observed position of the interface; the actual observed value of\nR1 /R2 \u2243 1 \u2212 2 suggests that \u03b7 Car's pre-eruption mass-loss rate was lower - closer to 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .4\nAnother reason to suppose that the astropause marks the wind from the beginning of \u03b7 Car's LBV\nphase is the timescale involved. A coherent structure like the [O iii] veil would disperse when its age exceeds\nthe sound crossing time, which is roughly 6\u00d7104 yr. This is much shorter than the \u223c3 Myr main sequence\nlifetime for a MZAMS =120 M\u2299 star (Chiosi & Maeder 1986), but comparable to the expected duration of\nthe LBV phase (e.g., Bohannan 1997). A mass-loss rate of perhaps 10\u22124 M\u2299 during that time (see above)\n3 These are roughly the present day parameters for \u03b7 Car's wind (Hillier et al. 2001), which don't necessarily apply before\nthe Great Eruption.\n4 While this provides only circumstantial evidence that \u03b7 Car's mass-loss rate is higher now than it was before the Great\nEruption, one can imagine why it might be true. The 19th-century Great Eruption removed at least 10 M\u2299 from the star\n(Smith et al. 2003), leaving \u03b7 Car with a significantly higher L/M ratio after the outburst. The weaker gravity as compared to\nbefore the eruption brings it \u223c10% closer to the Eddington limit, making it easier for the radiation-driven stellar wind to lift\nmaterial off the star.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwould fill the volume of the [O iii] veil, having a radius of roughly 30\u2032\u2032 or 1018 cm, with a mass of 6 M\u2299 and\nan average density of about 400 cm\u22123 . This is consistent with the electron density of 470\u00b1170 cm\u22123 that\nwe measured previously from spectra of the west edge of the veil (Smith & Morse 2004). At this density,\nhowever, thermal gas pressure alone is not enough to thwart the advance of HD 303308's wind. This erosion\nwill proceeded until denser inner parts of the cocoon are reached; this resistance would require densities\ninside the cocoon of\nnH \u2243\n\n\u1e402 v2\n4\u03c0R22 kT\n\nwhere \u1e402 , v2 , and R2 are the values for HD 303308's wind, as above, and T \u2243104 K is the temperature of\nthe ionized gas inside the cocoon. For R1 \u2243 R2 \u22431018 cm, the density inside the cocoon should be roughly\n2000 cm\u22123 , higher than observed at the edge of the veil (unless R2 is actually larger than the apparent\nseparation in Figure 1 due to a projection angle), but less than densities for some of the [N ii] knots inside\nit (Smith & Morse 2004).\nFurther observational work can potentially help clarify the nature of the [O iii] veil seen in our images.\nFor example, high dispersion long-slit spectra of the [O iii] \u03bb5007 emission line could be used to study the\nkinematics of the veil and the more extended shell. We would expect Doppler shifts of the [O iii] emission\nto be very different from [N ii] lines. Absorption profiles of Ca ii and Na i in echelle spectra of numerous\nstars surrounding \u03b7 Car might be used for the same purpose. If HD 303308 is inside a bubble as Figure 1\nsuggests, then a detailed comparison of its absorption spectrum and those of several nearby stars may prove\nvery interesting. Finally, one could determine if the veil is a standing shock by searching for faint X-ray\nemission that may be associated with it.\nWe thank Josh Walawender for assistance with the reduction of the CTIO/MOSAIC images.
