The\ntwo most relevant examples are the manganites in the regime of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), and cuprates at hole densities in the underdoped region. In manganites the inhomogeneities arise from phase competition between\nferromagnetic metallic and charge-ordered insulating phases. In cuprates the\ncompetition occurs between antiferromagnetic insulating and superconducting or metallic states. Microscopic theoretical approaches must consider this\nphenomenon for a proper description of manganites and cuprates. Homogeneous states can at best describe these compounds on large length scales, at\na phenomenological level.\nThe experimental evidence for the presence of inhomogeneous states, particularly in manganites but also to some extent in cuprates, is simply overwhelming, and it will not be comprehensibly reviewed here. Several theoretical\nstudies have also produced considerable evidence for the intrinsic tendency\nof electrons in these materials to induce competing states that are expected\nto separate microscopically. Some of these theoretical studies were reported\neven before the inhomogeneous states were clearly identified in experiments,\nhighlighting the remarkable cross-fertilization between theory and experiments\nthat exists in this area of investigation [2,3]. Reviews on this topic, in the manganite context, are already published [4,5]. Moreover, a book on the subject\nby one of the authors will be available soon [6]. The reader can find in these\nreferences hundreds of citations covering both theoretical and experimental\naspects. In this short contribution, frequent references to [4,5,6] will be made\nto save space, and reduce the overlap with that previous literature. In the\ncuprate context, the issue of inhomogeneities is not as universally accepted\nas in manganites, although important recent observations point in that direction. The potential relevance of electronic phase separation was remarked\nin that context many years ago by Kivelson and others [3]. The conference\nproceedings contained in this volume provide one of the best sources of information and references for Cu-oxides inhomogeneities. Uemura [7] has also\ndiscussed extensively the importance of these inhomogeneities to understand\nthe cuprates. Readers are encouraged to consult the above mentioned literature to find the relevant papers in this context, since in the present manuscript\nwe will not address the details of the remarkable evidence on self-organization\nin transition oxides. Only a small subset of references, mainly by the authors\nfor simplicity, is cited but the current effort is vast, involving dozens of groups.\nThis manuscript is divided in two parts. First, we focus on the recent proposal\n[4,5,6,8] that manganite phase competition is in fact the origin of the famous\n2\n\n\fCMR effect, showing that the inhomogeneities can lead to observable consequences. In such an analysis, it will become clear that analogous interesting\nphenomena can potentially be observed when any pair of phases are in close\ncompetition [8]. A second kind of phase separation near first-order transitions\nis described below, involving phases with the same electronic density as first\nobserved experimentally by Cheong and collaborators [9] and then also theoretically by Moreo et al. [10]. As a natural consequence, the second portion\nof the contribution focuses on qualitative predictions that are made for the\ncuprates, based on the lessons learned in the manganite context. In fact, one of\nthe main messages to the readers will be that manganites and cuprates share\na similar phenomenology that leads to the potentially important speculations\npresented here.\n\n2\n\nINHOMOGENEITIES IN MANGANITES AND OTHER COMPOUNDS\n\nManganites are interesting materials for at least three reasons:\n(1) First, they have remarkable magnetotransport properties. Figure 1 illustrates this phenomenon with the example of Pr1\u2212x Cax MnO3 at hole doping\nx=0.30[11]. In the absence of magnetic fields, this material is insulating. However, relatively small fields of a few Teslas are sufficient to induce a metal\ninsulator transition at low temperatures. In this regime the resistivity changes\nby several orders of magnitude, producing a truly colossal effect. The state\ninduced by the magnetic fields is a poor metal \u2013the residual zero temperature\nresistivity is high\u2013 and it is ferromagnetic. Note that fields of order 1T are\nsmall when compared with other typical electronic scales in a single crystal,\nbut unfortunately they are still too large for applications in computers.\n(2) A second reason for studying these compounds is the rich phase diagram\nthey have. In Fig. 2 the example of La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 is shown[12]. The phase\ndiagram contains a ferromagnetic (FM) metallic phase similar to the phase\ninduced in Fig. 1 upon the application of a magnetic field. In addition, Fig. 2\nexhibits many other phases, notably a charge-ordered (CO) and antiferromagnetic (AF) phase at hole densities x=0.50 and beyond. This phase is also\norbitally ordered [13], showing here that a new degree of freedom adds to the\ncharge and spin, leading to complex patterns of symmetry breaking. It will be\nargued below that the competition of these two phases is crucial to understand\nthe CMR [4,5,6]. The insulating state above the Curie temperature TC is also\nnontrivial, and plays a key role in the CMR phenomenon.\n(3) The third reason for studying manganites is the presence of intrinsic inhomogeneities, even in the best crystals available. Figure 3 is reproduced from\n3\n\n\fFigure 1. Temperature dependence of the resistivity of Pr1\u2212x Cax MnO3 at x=0.3\nand various magnetic fields. The inset is the phase diagram in the temperature-magnetic field plane, with the hatched region denoting hysteresis. From [11].\n\n[4], where the phase diagram of La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 is shown again, but this time\nincluding brief statements taken from the experimental literature that highlights the presence of inhomogeneities. Words such as \"polarons\", \"clusters\",\n\"multidomains\", \"AF-FM coexistence\" and related ones are ubiquitous in the\nexperimental literature. These materials appear to have a tendency toward\nan inhomogeneous state, and typical length scales mentioned often are of a\nfew lattice spacings (nanoscale). The pioneering experiments in this context\nare reviewed in Refs. [5,6], and the details will not be repeated here. Among\nthe most recent experiments are those of Renner et al. [14] using Scanning\nTunneling Microscopy (STM) applied to Bi1\u2212x Cax MnO3 in the regime of high\nhole doping and room temperature. The results are reproduced in Fig. 4.\nThey show atomic resolution features in the surface of this compound and the\npresence of two types of charge ordering (upper panel): checkerboard and homogeneous. The former is associated with the CO/AF state, while the latter is\npresumably the FM state. In Fig. 5, dark-field electron microscopy results for\n(La1\u2212y Pry )1\u2212x Cax MnO3 are also reproduced, this time from Uehara et al. [9].\nThis material has a clear competition CO/AF vs. FM that can be tuned by\nvarying the relative amount of La and Pr. The upper panel illustrates the low\n4\n\n\fFigure 2. Phase diagram of La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 , from Cheong and Hwang [12]. The\nnotation is standard. The marked hole density fractions appear to have more importance than others. According to modern theories, the canted regimes (CAF) may\ncorrespond to mixtures of AF and FM regions.\n\ntemperature results showing the presence of coexisting metallic and insulating\nregions. Their size is very large, at the submicrometer scale. If this type of\nexperiment is indeed testing intrinsic properties of crystals, this large length\nscale introduces limitations on the theoretical considerations.\nIt will be argued later that motivations (1), (2), and (3) are actually interconnected. The rich phase diagram (2) causes phase competition and concomitant\ninhomogeneities (3), which themselves induce CMR (1). The details are in the\nfollowing sections.\nRecent investigations have shown that inhomogeneities are present in other\ncompounds as well. Consider, for instance, the widely publicized remarkable\nSTM results by the group of Davis [15], where a wide distribution of d-wave\nsuperconducting gaps was observed at the surface of Bi2212 in the superconducting regime. The size of the clusters was found to be in the nanometer\nrange. This occurs both in the optimal and underdoped regimes. Note that\nthe universality of this property is still under discussion and inhomogeneities\nmay not be as prominent in other cuprates such as YBCO [16]. But at the\nvery least, measurements in the much studied Bi2212 material must be reanalyzed in view of the recently discovered inhomogeneities. In addition, there\nare dozens of papers that have reported stripe-like structures, particularly in\n5\n\n\fFigure 3. Schematic phase diagram of La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 , from Moreo et al. [4]. The\nwords added refer to statements reproduced from the experimental literature, at the\ndensity and temperature of those experiments, as well as the technique used (NMR,\nNeutrons, etc). The use of words such as droplets, domains, polarons, clusters, and\nothers indicate a tendency toward inhomogeneous behavior, present in most of the\nphase diagram.\n\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4 in the underdoped regime. This is another manifestation of\nthe intrinsic tendency toward microscopically inhomogeneous states (the list\nof references simply too long to be reproduced here). Finally, recent scanning\nSQUID microscopy study by Iguchi et al. [17] have reported the existence of\ndiamagnetic activity above Tc in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 . The phenomenon is found at\ntemperatures as high as 80 K, which is remarkable! The size of the superconducting islands was found to be as large as several micrometers.\nAdding to the evidence of inhomogeneous states in cuprates, recently indications of clustered states in Eu-based compounds have been reported in [18]. In\nthis reference, the analogies with manganites were discussed and emphasized.\nPreviously, it was widely believed that ferromagnetic polarons in Eu semiconductors were responsible for their properties. However, the most recent results\n[18] suggest a distribution of clusters of different sizes that may contain several carriers each. These are not polarons (one carrier with a spin distortion\naround) but more complex structures. The same observation regarding the\nrelevance (or lack of it) of polarons is valid for cuprates and manganites as\nwell. Their inhomogeneities cannot be visualized as \"polarons\".\nFinally, in ruthenates the possibility of orbital ordering has been recently\n6\n\n\fFigure 4. A. Atomic scale image of phase segregation at 299 K. From Renner\net al. [14]. The white broken line separates an insulating charge-ordering region\nfrom a more metallic and homogeneous phase. The compound is Bi1\u2212x Cax MnO3\nwith x=0.76. B. Intensity profile extracted along the straight line shown in A. Note\nthe difference in amplitude over the Mn sites in the ordered region due to charge\nordering. C. Spectroscopic signature of phase separation. The spectra were acquired\nin the location of the crosses. Two clearly distinct results are obtained.\n\nproposed [19]. In addition, large MR effects have been unveiled in bilayer Ruoxides [20]. Phase competition was also found in the single layer ruthenate\n[21]. It seems that (Ca,Sr)-based ruthenates may behave similarly as other\nmaterials mentioned here. Nickelates, cobaltites, and other compounds add to\nthe list where the inhomogeneities dominate in their ground state properties\n(for a far longer list than presented here, and more details, see Chs. 20 and\n22 of [6]).\n\n3\n\nELECTRONIC PHASE SEPARATION IN MANGANITES\n\nOn the theory front, most of the work carried out in the area of manganites\nuses models with two relevant degrees of freedom. One of them are the localized\n7\n\n\fFigure 5. Dark-field images for (La1\u2212y Pry )1\u2212x Cax MnO3 , from Uehara et al. [9].\nPanel (a) shows the coexistence of insulator CO and metal FM regions, at 20 K\nand y=0.375. Panel (b) corresponds to y=0.4 and T =17 K, while panel (c) is also\nat y=0.4 but for T =120 K. The latter shows the development of nanoscale charge\ndisordered domains at T >TC .\n\nt2g spins and the other are the mobile eg carriers. The latter has two relevant\norbitals per Mn-ion. As a consequence, typical Hamiltonians involve: (1) The\nhopping of eg electrons regulated by a 2\u00d72 hopping matrix with an overall\nscale t (the hopping amplitude). (2) A local Hund coupling JH that enforces\nalignment of spins between the eg and t2g spins (experimentally the spin of\nMn3+ is known to take the maximum value S=2, compatible with a large\nHund coupling). (3) A relatively small Heisenberg antiferromagnetic coupling\nJAF between the localized t2g spins, which, however, plays an important role in\nregimes where there are competing states of similar energy. In addition, either\non-site Coulombic interactions with couplings U, U \u2032 , and J in the standard\nnotation (Ch. 4 of [6]), or an interaction between the electrons and Jahn-Teller\n(JT) phonons \u2013regulated by a dimensionless coupling \u03bb\u2013 are incorporated. In\nthe approach favored by the present authors, the latter is used. In addition, if\none further assumes that the phonons are classical, Monte Carlo simulations\ncan be carried out without substantial technical difficulties [22]. Moreover,\nevidence shows that Coulomb interactions can be mimicked by combined large\n\u03bb and JH (Ch.8 of [6]), and it is expected that Coulombic or JT dominated\nmodels will lead to analogous behavior, at least at low temperatures.\n8\n\n\fUsing this type of models, Yunoki et al. [2,22] and later several others (see [5,6]\nfor references) have unveiled a clear signal of \"electronic phase separation\" in\nthe manganite context. This type of phase separation manifests as a discontinuity in the density of carriers as the chemical potential \u03bc varies, for example\nin a Monte Carlo simulation. It was observed that even if \u03bc changes smoothly,\nthere are electronic densities that can never be stabilized. If the system is\nforced to have such densities (for example working in the canonical ensemble),\nthen the ground state separates spontaneously into two macroscopic regions,\neach carrying the phase at the extremes of the density discontinuity found\nvarying \u03bc. At least for the one-orbital model (restricting the number of relevant eg orbitals to one), the separation involves AF hole-undoped and FM\nhole-doped phases [2]. For two orbitals the situation is more complicated and\nit involves the orbital degree of freedom [22]. Electronic phase separation is\na robust effect, and its presence in manganite models is not in doubt. The\nreader can find a discussion and the actual evidence of this behavior in [4,5]\nand Ch. 6 of [6]. The word electronic in front of phase separation is used here\nto remark the different densities of the two competing phases. It is widely\naccepted that if the tail 1/r of the Coulomb interaction is incorporated, the\nmacroscopic phase separation mutates into a microscopic effect, with the formation of clusters in the nanoscale range (see [3] and Ch. 6 of [6]). This has\nimplications for the rationalization of the results of Uehara et al. [9] where\nsubmicrometer clusters were reported.\nIt is important to state that electronic phase separation in models of cuprates\nhas been proposed even before the recent work in manganites. In the cuprate\ncontext, the proposed separation involves the AF insulator and either a metal\nor a superconductor (see for instance the work of Kivelson and collaborators in\nRef.[3]). Phase separation appears clearly in the famous t-J model, although\nit is still under much discussion whether it occurs at realistic values of J/t\n[23].\nAn interesting observation is that in regimes of temperatures, couplings, and\ndensities that have cluster coexistence, there is a pseudogap in the density of\nstates (DOS) (see Fig.6). This occurs, for example, at densities where phase\nseparation exists by lowering the temperature to T =0. Intuitively, at intermediate temperatures precursors of phase separation must be present in the form\nof coexisting clusters. The existence of this pseudogap feature was remarked\ntheoretically in [24]. Photoemission experiments have also unveiled a similar\nbehavior in bilayer manganites [25]. It is expected that pseudogaps would appear in the density of states in the regimes of inhomogeneities, as a natural\nconsequence of the competition between a metal (flat DOS) and an insulator (gapped DOS). As discussed later, this should occur in CMR manganites\nabove the Curie temperature as well, since phase competition is expected in\nthat regime. A pseudogap is well known to exist in underdoped copper oxide\nmaterials as well.\n9\n\n\f1.0\n\nN(\u03c9)\n\nN(\u03c9)\n\nN(\u03c9)\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0.8\n\nJH=8.0\n\u03bb=1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\u22121.0\n\n0.6\n0.0\n\n\u03c9\u2212\u03bc\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\u22121.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u03c9\u2212\u03bc\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u22121.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u03c9\u2212\u03bc\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\nN(\u03c9)\n0.6\n0.4\nW=0.5\nW=1.0\nW=2.0\n\u22121.5 \u22121.0 \u22120.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5\n\n0.2\n\n(c) 0.0\n\n\u03c9\u2212\u03bc\n\nFigure 6.

For more details see [10].\n\n4\n\nGENERAL ASPECTS OF PHASE COMPETITION IN THE\nPRESENCE OF QUENCHED DISORDER\n\nThe discovery of electronic phase separation in manganite models described\nin the previous section, and the resulting nanoscale coexisting clustered-state\nupon the introduction of 1/r Coulomb effects, provides a first approximation toward the understanding of the physics of manganites (Fig. 3). This\npossible explanation is robust on theoretical grounds and compatible with\nexperimental data. However, it is important to analyze phase separation in\nmore general terms. In fact, the experiments of Uehara et al. [9] show clusters of sizes in the submicrometer scale involving two phases (varying y in\n(La1\u2212y Pry )1\u2212x Cax MnO3 it is possible to interpolate between FM and CO\nstates at constant x). The electronic density of these coexisting clusters is\nlikely the same since different densities would lead to large energy penalizations due to the accumulation of charge.\nThe results of the previous section can be reformulated as a first order transition as a function of the chemical potential \u03bc, as shown in Fig. 7. Let us now\n10\n\n\fT\nPM\n\nAF\n\nFM\n\u03bcc\n\n\u03bc\n\nFigure 7. Schematic representation of the electronic phase separation phenomenon\nin the T -\u03bc plane. The notation is standard.\n\nconsider a similar first-order transition, but now varying an arbitrary parameter instead of \u03bc. This transition could occur at constant electronic density,\nchanging for example the hopping amplitude t (which can effectively be done\nby chemical substitution as in (La1\u2212y Pry )1\u2212x Cax MnO3 ). In this case the 1/r\nCoulomb interaction will not lead to such dramatic consequences (nanoclusters) as in the electronic phase separation case. However, quenched disorder\nproduces interesting results. To carry out this type of calculations, recently\nBurgy et al. [8] \u221a\nused an Ising\n\u221a spin \"toy model\", with couplings J1 , J2 and J4\nat distances 1, 2, and 5 lattice spacings. It is expected that the general\naspects of the results will not be severely affected by the details of the model.\nThe Hamiltonian was selected such that two phases are in competition in the\nmodel under investigation. In Fig. 8 they are called phases \"O1 \" and \"O2 \"\n(in practice FM and AF \"collinear\" phases, respectively). The reader should\nnot be deterred by the fact that the present convention for \"O1 \" differs from\nthat in [8]. The model is invariant under the transformation (J1 ,J2 ,J4 ) \u2192 (J1 ,J2 ,-J4 ), hence the FM and AF states are interchangeable. The couplings are\nselected such that in the absence of disorder the phase diagram is as shown\nin Fig. 8 with dashed lines. A first-order transition separates the two phases\nat low temperatures. This is similar to Fig. 7 but now varying one of the couplings (J2 ) in the model, rather than the chemical potential. The critical value\nis J2c =0.7J1 , but its actual value is a numerical detail not believed to be of\nrelevance.\nQuenched disorder is introduced by adding a random component to J2 since\nit is this coupling that must be varied to transform from one phase to the\nother. The random component is taken from a box distribution centered at\nzero, of total width W . From the study of Imry and Wortis [26] it is to be\nexpected that disorder will transfrom a first-order transition into a continuous one. Simulations indicate a rich phase diagram when the two phases\ncompete and disorder is introduced. The results for two typical values of W\nare in Fig. 8, reproduced from [8]. At values of J2 far from the region of\ncompetition, the disorder strength used is not sufficient to alter the value of\n11\n\n\f5.0\n\n400\n300\n\nT [K]\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\n200\n\n2\n\nTc\n\n100\nGd Sm Nd Pr\n1.32\n1.36\n\nrA [A]\n\n2.0\n\nTO\n\n0.0\n\u22120.2\n\nTN\n\n10\n\n0\n1.28\n\n1.0\n\nLa2\u2212xSrxCuO4\n\nT [K]\n\nT\n\n3\n\n10\n\nRE1-xSrxMnO3\n(x=0.45)\n\nAF\n\nLa\n1\n10\n1.40\n0.0\n\nSuper\u2212\nconducting\n0.1\n\nx\n\nPM T*\n\nTO\n\n1\n\nO1\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0.2\n\nO2\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\nJ2\u2212J2c\nFigure 8. Phase diagram of the \"toy model\" of Ising variables with J1 -J2 -J4\ncouplings in two dimensions (J4 =0.2J1 to induce a clear first-order transition at low\ntemperature, and J1 =1 provides the energy scale). This phase diagram is believed\nto represent the behavior of any pair of competing phases. Disorder is introduced\ninto the coupling J2 that allows the system to change from phase 1 to phase 2, which\nin this case are ferromagnetic and collinear, respectively. Details of the definition\nof the disorder, lattices and techniques used, can be found in the original reference\nBurgy et al. [8]. TO1 and TO2 are the true ordering temperatures, while T \u2217 is the\nclean-limit ordering temperature, which survives as a rapid \"crossover\" for cluster\nformation when disorder is introduced. The insets are phase diagrams of Mn-oxides\non the left (private communication from Y. Tokura and Y. Tomioka), and the single\nlayer cuprate on the right.\n\nthe critical temperatures. However, in the region of competition near J2c , far\nmore dramatic effects are observed. For \"weak\" disorder, both critical temperatures are appreciably reduced around J2c , although still the general shape\nof the phase diagram resembles bicritical or tricritical behavior. This is one\nclass of results that may be observed in experiments, as reported recently in\nPr0.55 (Ca1 \u2212y Sry )0.45 MnO3 [27]. On the other hand, for \"large\" disorder the\nreduction in the critical temperatures is far more dramatic, and it leads to\na region without long-range order even at T =0. An example of this could be\n(La1 \u2212x Tbx )2/3 Ca1/3 MnO3 , reported in [28].\nIf we are correct in assuming that the general aspects of the problem remain\nfor more realistic competing phases, it is then predicted that in materials\n12\n\n\fwith phase competition two types of phases diagrams are to be expected for\ndifferent strengths of the disorder (namely, the weak and strong disorder cases\nof Fig. 8). In the insets of the same figure, two experimentally determined\nphase diagrams are shown with features reminiscent of those in the theoretical\ncalculation. On the right, is the well known phase diagram of La2\u2212x Srx CuO4\nthat in the underdoped regime shows a clear depletion of both the N\u00e9el and\nsuperconducting (SC) critical temperatures, forming a region widely known\nas the \"spin glass\". It is tempting to speculate that this region is actually\nproduced by phase competition between AF (perhaps containing stripes) and\nSC states. The actual form of the state is discussed below. On the left inset of\nFig. 8 is the phase diagram of the Sr-based x=0.45 manganite as determined\nby Tomioka and Tokura [27]. Note the presence of a deep reduction in the\ncritical temperatures, generating a feature that resembles \"quantum critical\"\nbehavior. Both insets have qualitative similarity with the theoretical study,\nand it is natural to believe that this is not accidental.\n\n5\n\nSTATES OF RELEVANCE IN THE REGION OF PHASE COMPETITION AND PREDICTION OF T \u2217\n\nWhat sort of states are induced in the region of competition upon the introduction of disorder? Typical results are shown in Fig. 9, where averages\nover a few hundred Monte Carlo sweeps are shown. On the left, the state is\ndominated by the white color. In our convention that means that in most of\nthe sites of the lattice the order parameter is not well developed, namely, as\ntime evolves the values of the order parameters fluctuate leading to a net zero\nresult. This is the picture of a standard paramagnet, and it occurs at temperatures above the original critical temperature of the \"clean\" (not disordered)\nlimit. This temperature will play a key role in the following and we denote it by\nT \u2217 . This is a Griffiths temperature. Griffiths effects appear to be substantially\nmagnified when disorder is introduced in regions of phase competition [8,29].\nIn the middle of Fig. 9 the state between the actual critical temperature TO1\nand T \u2217 is presented. This state will lead us to a rationalization of the CMR\neffect, as described below. It still contains some paramagnetic (white) areas,\nbut now it is clear that there are regions that have quasi-static local order and\nclusters are formed. These clusters are denoted in the figure with three grey\ncolors as indicated in the caption. Some of them have the order that will become truly dominant below TO1 (which is actually a Curie temperature in the\nexample considered). However, these clusters can randomly have a positive or\nnegative order parameter, leading to a globally disordered state. If Heisenberg\nvariables \u2013instead of Ising\u2013 would have been considered, then the orientation\nof the local order parameters of the clusters would point in arbitrary directions, but still leading to a global cancellation. In addition to these clusters, in\n13\n\n\fFigure 9. Typical spin configurations representative of dominant states in the toy\nmodel, generated by the MC simulation. Shown are averages over nearly 100 MC\nsweeps. The coupling and temperature for the three cases (1-2-3) are those marked\nin Fig.8. The conventions used are the following: the darkest regions correspond\nto the FM phase with positive order parameter; the next dark tone is FM with\nnegative order parameter; the light grey is the competing collinear phase; while\nwhite corresponds to a paramagnetic region. The original colors can be found in\nBurgy et al. [8].\n\nthe figure one can observe small islands of the competing phase, namely, the\nphase that will become stable upon further increasing couplings. The fluctuations in the disorder create regions where J2 is locally larger than the critical\nvalue, and the other phase is stabilized.\nIt is easy to imagine that transport in such a complicated environment is\nquite complicated. Consider, for instance, a spin-up electron that crosses the\nsample coupled to the \"toy model\" states of relevance by a Hund coupling,\nas it occurs when eg and t2g degrees of freedom are considered. Movement\nwithin the spin-up locally ordered regions should be nearly ballistic for small\nclusters. However, for the spin-down regions as well as the competing phase\nregions (that contain spins up and down in stripes) the movement of the\nspin-up electron is not favored. They act as \"insulators\" for the up species of\nelectrons. These insulating regions will increase the resistivity dramatically.\nThere is no obvious easy channel for the flow of charge from one side of the\nsample to the other in this context. We will see below that this translates into\na huge resistivity.\nFinally, as the temperature is lowered further, then either the spin up or down\nclusters dominate, a percolation occurs and the dominance of one \"color\" is\nfound in simulations (as shown in Fig. 9-3). This state will be favorable for\ntransport of at least one spin species of electrons, although it is still inhomogeneous. Note the interesting formation of domain-walls in the FM order\nparameter, through the stabilization of the competing phase [8].\n14\n\n\f6\n\nGENERALIZATION OF TOY MODEL RESULTS TO REAL\nMANGANITES\n\nCalculations such as those reported in the previous section cannot be performed directly using realistic models for manganites. These models involve\nmany degrees of freedom, some of them quantum mechanical (e.g. the eg\nelectrons). Such complex system cannot be easily simulated in clusters large\nenough to see percolative physics (although they can be studied fairly well\nto obtain phase diagrams in the absence of disorder). However, the results\nobtained with the toy model were easy to understand and they seem general\nenough to be valid under several other circumstances as well. Thus, we believe\nthat in real manganites the competition between the FM and CO/AF states\nin the presence of sources of disorder also leads to a phase diagram as shown\nin Fig. 8, and to states as in Fig. 9 simply changing the labeling of the phases.\nAs a consequence, two interesting conjectures can be made for manganites inspired by the study of simpler systems: (1) We believe that the CMR state has\na \"clustered\" structure, with preformed FM and CO/AF clusters and even PM\nregions. Figure 10 shows a sketch of this state. It has no global net moment,\nbut locally there is order (see also [9]). (2) There has to be a T \u2217 scale in Mnoxide real systems that correspond to a Griffiths temperature where clusters\nstart forming. This temperature is larger than the true ordering temperatures.\n\nFM\nInsulator\n\nFigure 10. Proposed state for manganites in the CMR regime. FM clusters are\nlocally formed, but with random orientations of the order parameter. The insulator\nforms walls between the FM metallic regions.\n\nTo test these assumptions, calculations must be carried out to check the presence of a CMR effect in a clustered state. This will be the goal of the next\nsection. In addition, the T \u2217 new scale should be observable in real materials. Some experimental results are described below that have reported results\ncompatible with the clustered state and the existence of T \u2217 .\n15\n\n\f7\n\nPOSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE CMR EFFECT\n\nFrom the spin toy model discussed before, it is not possible to obtain the resistivity directly. However, it is possible to make reasonable assumptions that\nwould allow us to obtain a rough estimation of that resistivity. As described\nin the previous section, we will consider electrons with either spin up or down\nmoving in the background of the spins generated by the Monte Carlo simulations (represented in the various regimes by the three typical states shown\nin Fig. 8). For each state, simple rules can be established that would allow us\nto write a random resistor network approximation to the problem. The reader\ncan find some details in [8], but the idea is simple: from the perspective of, say,\nthe spin-up electron then (1) a low resistance in the effective network should\nconnect FM regions with the positive magnetization; (2) a high (or infinite)\nresistance links the positive and negative magnetization FM regions (due to\nthe Hund coupling spin-up electrons do not propagate in the negative moment\nFM areas); and (3) an intermediate resistance links the FM positive moment\n\n500\n\n\u03c1\n\n400\n\n3\n\nHs=0\n\u22123\nHs=10\n\u22122\nHs=10\n\nResistivity\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n300\n\nJ2=0.68\n\n1.5\nH=0\n0.001\n0.01\n\n1\n0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2 1.4\n\nT/J1\n\n200\n100\n0\n1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\nT\n\nFigure 11. Resistance close to J2c , obtained from the MC configurations of the\ntoy model J1 -J2 -J4 by a suitable translation to manganite language of the many\nphases, supplemented by mild assumptions on the individual resistances that form\nthe resistor network (see text and Ref. [8]). Note the large value of the zero-field\nresistance in the intermediate temperature region with preformed clusters, where\nthere is a global cancellation of the order parameters (black is FM with positive\nmoment, dark grey is FM with negative moment and light grey is the phase competing with FM). Resistances including an external field Hs (in units of J1 ) are also\nshown. There is a strong dependence of the resistance with external field, leading\nto a huge MR ratio, comparable to experiments. The snapshots on the right correspond to typical configurations before (upper panel) and after (lower panel) a field\nHs = 10\u22122 J1 is turned on (for details see [8]). The inset shows similar behavior in\n3D (see Fig. 12).\n\n16\n\n\fand PM regions. Analogous rules can be setup for spin-down electrons. By this\nprocedure, for each Monte Carlo generated \"snapshot\", a resistor network is\nconstructed, and then solved iteratively using the Kirchoff equations.\nThe resistance (or resistivity) vs. temperature obtained by the procedure outlined in the previous paragraph is shown in Fig. 11, for a coupling J2 close\nto J2c . In the absence of magnetic fields, a huge peak is found at intermediate temperatures in qualitative agreement with experimental results, and\nalso with the theoretical expectations as described in the previous section.\nThe state between TO1 and T \u2217 , with its clustered and messy structure, is very\ndetrimental for transport of charge, and the results of the resistor network\napproximation confirm this guess.\nThe most spectacular result is the dependence of the resistance with magnetic\nfields, also contained in Fig. 11. Consider, for example, a tiny field of just\n10\u22123 J1 in the natural units of the problem. This field is found to reduce the\npeak in the resistivity by 50%, an enormous effect! For a field of 10\u22122 J1 the\npeak has basically disappeared in the scale of Fig. 11. This effect found in\nsimulations is quite similar in scale to those reported experimentally. Similar\nresults are found in 3D simulations (Fig. 12), although of smaller magnitude\n(work is still in progress in this contex, see [30]).\n3\n\n5\n\nResistivity\n\n3D J1-J2 Ising model\n4\n3\n\n2.5\n\nTC\n\nPM\n\n2\n\n*\n\nT\n\n2\n\nTN\n1.5\n\n1\n0\n\nFM\n0.2\n\nH=0\n0.001\n0.01\n\nA-AF\n0.3 J2/J1\n\n1\n0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2 1.4\n\nT/J1\n\nFigure 12.

The calculation was done using\nsimilar resistor network rules as in two dimensions. Details, such as couplings used\nand strength of disorder, can be found in [30].\n\nWhat is the physics behind the results in Fig. 11? Consider also in Fig. 11\n(right panels) a typical state found in the simulations at zero field, in the\ntemperature range of interest. As described before, it contains regions with\n17\n\n\fpositive and negative magnetization as well as insulating domains. The key\nissue for the present discussion is the relatively robust size of the preformed\nferromagnetic clusters. Suppose the magnetic field has a sign such that it favors the positive magnetization. The negative magnetization clusters involve\ndozens of spins and in this respect they behave like giant effective spins. Such\na giant spin can rotate in spin space under the influence of a tiny magnetic\nfield. The effect is large not because the field is large, but because the preformed effective spin is large! In fact the bottom right panel of Fig. 11 shows\nthe net effect of adding a magnetic field of 10\u22122 J1 . The regions with negative magnetization have flipped to positive, the insulating regions separating\npositive from negative magnetizations have melted away (since they are no\nlonger needed), and now several channels for transport are opened for spin-up\nelectrons. A small magnetic field produces huge changes in transport due to\nthe existence of preformed ferromagnetic clusters! We believe that these ideas\nhave captured the essence of the CMR paradox, although much more work is\ncertainly needed to fully refine them.\n\n8\n\nPHASE COEXISTENCE ABOVE TC and EXPERIMENTAL\nDETERMINATION OF T \u2217\n\nAt present, several exciting experiments are being carried out to study the\nexistence of a T \u2217 new scale in manganites. We cannot review them all here for\nlack of space, but the reader can consult Ch. 19 of [6] for a more detailed discussion, preliminary information, and additional citations. For our purposes,\nhere we will only describe the recent work of Adams et al. [31] where neutron\nscattering results for La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 with x=0.30 were reported in a wide\nrange of temperatures. Some results are in Fig. 13. The authors of Ref.[31]\nstudied diffuse scattering in the vicinity of a Bragg peak. Some features at\nparticular values of the momenta are identified as caused by the presence of\n\"uncorrelated\" Jahn-Teller polarons. The intensity of one of those momenta\nvs. temperature is in Fig. 13 (a). Below the Curie temperature the signal is\nsmall, while in the range experimentally investigated the intensity is nearly\nconstant above TC . This behavior does not follow the resistivity of the system,\nwhich has a large peak at TC , and it rapidly decreases both below and above\nthat ordering temperature. Then, the uncorrelated polarons (namely, a state\ndominated by a gas of independent fairly heavy polarons) is not the state of\nrelevance for manganites, since it does not correlate with the resistivity.\nOn the other hand, in Fig. 13 (b), results of the same experiment but at other\nmomenta are shown. They correspond to the signal attributed to \"correlated\npolarons\", which manifest as a weak peak in the vicinity of the dominant\nBragg peak. This feature in the neutron intensity indicates that polarons are\nnot independent, but they form a structure that seems to resemble closely the\n18\n\n\f200\n\nCounts in 7 min\n\nCounts in 10 min\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\nTC\n\n100\n\nTC\n\n0\n220\n\npolaron peak\ncentral peak\nresistivity\n\n0\n240\n260\nTemperature (K)\n\n220\n\n280\n\n240\n\n260\n280\nTemperature (K)\n\n300\n\nFigure 13.

From Adams et al.\n[31], where more details can be found.\n\nCE-state of half-doped manganites [33]. Then, the correlated polaron signal\nshould be more properly referred to as CE-clusters or charge-ordered clusters,\nand they correspond to small islands of a phase (CO/AF) that becomes stable\nby changing the chemical composition. The key result of Ref.[31] (Fig. 13 (b))\nis that the intensity corresponding to the charge-ordered clusters behaves as\na function of temperature quite similarly as the resistivity does. Adams et al.\n[31] write that \"The similarity of the data indicate a common origin.\" Then,\nthe coexistence of CE-like clusters, with the FM clusters known to exist in\nthe same regime [34] and, probably, paramagnetic regions as well, forms a\ncomplex state whose existence is correlated with the anomalous behavior found\nin transport measurements. Following the neutron peak intensity related with\ncharge-ordered clusters vs. temperature would allow for a determination of\nT \u2217 when the signal vanishes. These conclusions are supported by a variety of\nmeasurements by several groups in addition to those described here (for a list\nsee Ch. 19 of [6]). T \u2217 in materials such as La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 (x=0.30) appears to\nbe located in the neighborhood of 400 K [34]. Adding to these results, recent\nstudies by Argyriou et al. [35] have also reported a T \u2217 in bilayered manganites\nthat appears to correspond to a glassy transition, at a temperature well above\nthe ordering temperatures. Work in this important and exciting subarea of\nmanganite physics is just starting, and many surprises will likely be found in\nthe near future.\n19\n\n\f9\n\nLESSONS FOR THE CUPRATES\n\nThe results for manganites described above, with inhomogeneities clearly found\nboth in experimental and theoretical investigations, appear to originate in\nphase competition. The general considerations mentioned during the discussion of this problem indicate that phase competition between any pair of fairly\ndifferent ordered phases should lead to a similar phenomenology. In particular,\nthe results of Fig. 8 should apply to the superconductivity vs. AF insulator\ncompetition in high temperature superconductors. As a consequence, by mere\nanalogy with manganites it is possible to list some properties that cuprates\nmay have if indeed they behave similarly as other transition metal oxides [8].\nThe results of the present discussion when applied to cuprates can be labeled\nas \"speculations\" at this point, since it is difficult to carry out detailed calculations for Cu-oxides. However, they are \"educated\" speculations that deserve\nserious consideration and they may help clarifying the complicated behavior\nof cuprates in the underdoped regime. Note, once again, that the readers are\nencouraged to consult the literature presented here (e.g. [6] and [8]) as well\nas the rest of these proceedings, to find other papers with analogous ideas.\nPercolative concepts in cuprates have been around for some time, although\nthey have not been at the forefront of the theoretical developments.\nThe potential similarities cuprates-manganites lead to the following possibilities:\n* The phase diagram of La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 in one inset of Fig. 8 is believed to\ncontain a spin-glass phase. From the main result of the same figure, this phase\ncould instead arise from a mixture of SC and AF clusters. The different orientations of the order parameters in different clusters could lead to their global\ncancellation (the order parameter for SC contains a phase factor that could\nrandomly change from cluster to cluster). The implication, then, is that the\nphase transition SC-AF in the clean limit with no sources of disorder could\nhave first-order characteristics, as sketched in Fig. 14 (a). This is reminiscent\nof the behavior in organic superconductors and in SO(5) theories of superconductivity [36,37].\n* The famous pseudogap temperature scale would be in this context just the\nGriffiths temperature of Fig. 8, namely, a remnant of the clean limit phase\ntransition below which the system orders locally. The results of Iguchi et al.\n[17] with superconducting regions in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 even at temperatures as\nhigh as 80 K, suggest that indeed Tc could be much higher than previously\nbelieved in this context.\n* Percolative effects may exist in cuprates as well, as they seem to be present\nin manganites. This is a natural consequence of the inhomogeneous picture\n20\n\n\f1000\n\n7500\n\u03c1dc\n\n(a)\n\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\n\nT (K)\n\n(\u03bc\u03a9cm)\n\n(b)\n5000\n\nTN\n\n100\n\nT*\nTc\n\n3D\nAF\n10\n0.0\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n\n2500\n\nSuper\u2212\nconducting\n0.1\n0.2 x\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\nT 100\n\nFigure 14. (a) Conjectured phase diagram for high-temperature superconductivity\n[8]. Black lines should be the actual phase boundaries without disorder. The shaded\nregion is conjectured to have metallic (SC) and insulating (AF) coexisting regions\nin the real materials. (b) Resistivity \u03c1ab vs T, from a random-resistor network calculation as in Ref.[39], where details can be found. A 50\u00d750 cluster was used, with\n\u03c1ab for insulating (optimal doping) fraction p=1.0 (0.0) taken from LSCO x=0.04\n(0.15) data [H. Takagi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 2975 (1992). See also Y. Ando et\nal., cond-mat/0104163]. The inset labels are the p fractions at 100 K, all of which\nare smoothly reduced with decreasing T until percolation to a SC state occurs at\np=0.5.\n\nfor the underdoped regime [38]. Some rough calculations of resistivities using random resistor networks have been already presented (see Fig. 14 (b),\nreproduced from [8], and also Ref. [39]).\n* Although not discussed in detail in this paper, studies in Mn-oxides [10] have\nbrought forward the ideas of Imry and Ma about phase competition using the\nRandom Field Ising Model [40]. In this context, when a cluster of radius R\nis created inside a region dominated by a competing phase, near a first-order\ntransition, the energy penalization due to the surface is positive and grows\nas Rd\u22121 where d is the dimension. On the other hand, the fluctuations in\nthe disorder strength grow as Rd/2 , from standard considerations involving\nrandom numbers. A balance between the two occurs at d=2, widely believed\nto be the critical dimension of the problem. This dimension is of relevance for\ntwo-dimensional cuprates. Effects of this nature could be at work in bilayered\nmanganites as well. If Heisenberg variables are used instead of Ising variables,\nit can be shown that the critical dimension increases to 4, and the ideas may\neven apply in three dimensional systems.\n* If it is correct that cuprates and manganites are both described by the same\nphenomenological approach contained in Fig. 8, then there has to be an analog in Cu-oxides of the \"colossal\" MR in Mn-oxides! From the discussion in\nprevious sections it seems that CMR occurs when preformed FM clusters are\nrapidly aligned by an external magnetic field. In the SC vs. AF case, supercon21\n\n\fducting clusters may be preformed with a basically random phase. If one could\nhave an external field that favors the alignment of these phases, this theory\npredicts that rapidly a SC state should be generated. However, there is no external field that we know that can produce this alignment. An approximation\nwould be to bring the sample in the clustered regime in close proximity to\na system already superconducting. This would favor the phase alignment. In\nfact, there are already results in the literature reporting a \"colossal proximity\neffect\" in YBCO, that may be a manifestation of the theory discussed here\n[41]. This is an exciting area of research that may lead to many surprises.\n\n* Disorder may play a role in cuprates far more important than previously\nanticipated. By carefully growing samples with as little disorder as possible,\nthe Tc should grow, having T \u2217 as the best value possible. Purely phenomenological studies in this context by Attfield et al. [42], both for manganites and\ncuprates, lead to similar conclusions. Recent results by Eisaki et al. [43] also\nsuggest that carefully prepared samples have higher critical temperatures than\npreviously believed. Could it be that a new generation of ultra-clean samples\nis needed to make progress in high temperature superconductors? This is not\na pleasant thought, but we may need even better crystals than currently available to unveil the proper phase diagram of Cu-oxides.\n\n* Finally, note that materials such as CeCoIn5 heavy-fermions appear to have a\nphase diagram quite similar to those of cuprates, including a pseudogap regime\nand a T \u2217 [44]. We feel that it is unlikely that totally different mechanism are\nat work in these families of compounds. Thus, the explanation for pseudogap\nand T \u2217 must be simple and general, and the one described above satisfies\nthese requirements. We do not believe that exotic two dimensional states are\nresponsible for these features.\n\nIt is important to remark that there are alternative viewpoints to the hypothesis of a first-order transition smeared by quenched disorder into a mixed-phase\nstate discussed here. The alternative is to have in the clean limit tetracritical behavior in the competition between the antiferromagnet and the d-wave\nsuperconductor [45,46] (as opposed to the bicritical or tricritical behavior addressed here). This leads to a coexistence of the two order parameters which\noccurs even locally, contrary to the view postulated here and in manganites\nthat there is a microscopic separation of phases in real space. Some experiments support this view [47]. We have not studied how quenched disorder\ninfluences on a clean-limit tetracritical phase diagram. Hopefully this issue\nwill be clarified in future work.\n22\n\n\f10\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn recent years the key role of inhomogeneities in transition metal oxides\nand related compounds has been unveiled. The evidence in manganites is\nvery strong, both in theory and experiments. The competing phases here are\nCO/AF and FM. The existence of preformed clusters and its easy alignment\nwith modest magnetic fields leads to a large magnetoresistance. Phase separation appears to be at the heart of this phenomenon. By mere analogy with\nthe Mn-oxide phenomenology, speculations can be made for cuprates as well.\nThe spin-glass phase could arise from SC vs. AF phase competition, and the\npseudogap T \u2217 could be a Griffiths temperature where local clusters start forming. Colossal effects could be present in Cu-oxides, a challenging concept. The\nimportance of inhomogeneities in cuprates is slowly being unveiled by experiments, and these notorious deviations from an homogeneous state must be\nconsidered in any serious theoretical description of the still poorly understood\nhigh temperature superconductors.\nThis work was supported by NSF grant DMR-0122523 and by MARTECH.\nConversations with A.
