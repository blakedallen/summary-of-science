The timeindependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TISE), on the other\nhand, is viewed as a subsidiary of the TDSE because it\ncan be derived from the latter by a separation of variables when the Hamiltonian operator is independent of\ntime [1].\nHowever, there is something unsettling about timedependent quantum mechanics: the spatial variables define a configuration space that contains the possible outcomes of position measurements performed on the system by an observer, which are given by the eigenvalues\nof the position operator, whereas the time variable plays\nthe role of a parameter indicated by an external clock\n(a classical instrument) with no time measurements contemplated and, consequently, no time operator featuring\nin the formalism [2]. As a result of time not being an\nobservable the time-energy uncertainty relation has a different character from the uncertainty relation involving\nany pair of noncommuting observables; in particular, the\nmethod for its derivation and its interpretation depend\n\n\u2217\n\njularce@univalle.edu.co\n\non the physical context. A historical account of the role\nof time in quantum mechanics is provided in Ref. [3] and\nthe time-energy uncertainty relation is reviewed in Ref.\n[4].\nThe involvement of an external clock implies that the\nTDSE really describes an open system [5], albeit in the\nidealized limit that the back-reaction of the system on\nthe clock is negligible [2(a)], so that relaxation and decoherence effects are imperceptible and the dynamics become unitary for practical purposes. Hence, it appears\nthat if a truly closed system is to be considered its description should be fully based on the TISE [6\u20138]. If\nsuch an unorthodox view is taken seriously one is led to\nask how time emerges from this fundamentally timeless\nframework. This question is particularly critical in quantum cosmology since, after all, the cosmos is the ultimate\nclosed system.\nIn the field of quantum gravity the situation is further complicated because quantum mechanics and general relativity treat time in incompatible ways, the former as part of a fixed Newtonian background, the latter\nas part of a coordinatization of the spacetime manifold,\nwhich implies that it cannot be singled out in the theory since the equations of general relativity are covariant\nunder spacetime coordinate transformations and physical results are independent of the coordinatization. The\n\"problem of time\" in the context of quantum gravity is\nreviewed in Ref. [9], but it must be realized that it is\nmore general.\n\n\f2\nSeveral solutions to the problem of time have been proposed. One of them consists of coupling the system to a\n\"quantum clock\" [10], but it turns out that the \"time\"\ndefined by such clock exhibits some awkward characteristics like nonlocality, nonuniversality and quantization,\nand that a well-resolved time measurement must introduce a large perturbation into the system. The resulting\nstate of affairs has been eloquently summarized by Peres\n[10(a)]: \"It thus seems that the Schr\u00f6dinger wave function \u03a8(t), with its continuous time evolution given by\ni~\u03a8\u0307 = H\u03a8, is an idealization rooted in classical theory.\nIt is operationally ill defined (except in the limiting case\nof stationary states) and should probably give way to\na more complicated dynamical formalism, perhaps one\nnonlocal in time. Thus, in retrospect, the Hamiltonian\napproach to quantum physics carries the seeds of its own\ndemise.\"\nThe first sentence of Peres's statement is the observation that the TDSE is not a fully quantum-mechanical\nbut rather a hybrid quantal-classical equation of motion,\nbecause time appears to be a meaningful concept only\nat the classical level. Therefore, it seems natural to seek\nquantal variables that can play the role of clocks in the\nclassical limit. This is the strategy followed by Briggs\nand coworkers, who have shown that the TDSE for the\nsystem results from the TISE of the clock plus system\ncomposite by first decoupling the clock variables from\nthe rest of the degrees of freedom (DOFs), employing\nthe Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, and then\nusing the WKB approximation for the clock variables\n[8]. A somewhat similar method was used earlier by Englert [7]. Moreover, Briggs and Rost have shown that a\ntime-energy uncertainty relation for the system can be\ndeduced from the position-momentum uncertainty relation of the clock [8(a,e)]. Since a measurement is made at\na particular instant (or interval) of time, in this approach\nthe probabilistic interpretation (PI) [2] is introduced after the clock variables have been identified. Hence, it appears that the roles of the TDSE and the TISE have been\ninverted: the latter is the fundamental equation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, after all, since the former\ncan be derived from it in the semiclassical limit. An analogous procedure can be applied in the relativistic quantum domain [8(a,b),9,11]; in particular, the semiclassical\nBO-WKB scheme has been widely employed in canonical\nquantum gravity after the pioneering work of Banks [11],\nbecause its fundamental equation, the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation [12], does not involve a time variable explicitly.\nMore radical programs on the problem of time pursue\nthe construction of a conceptually and formally consistent quantum theory that includes the PI but avoids any\na priori conception of time [6, 7, 9, 13\u201316]. Some of\nthem seek an internal relational \"time\", which in a sense\nresembles the external classical time, and an associated\nlaw that provides an effective description of dynamical\nevolution [6, 7, 14\u201316], in tune with the second sentence\nof Peres's statement quoted above. A strategy of this\nsort is the conditional probability interpretation (CPI)\n\nof Page and Wootters [6] whose basic tenet is to extract\nthe dynamical evolution of the system's state from the\nconditional dependence of probabilities on the value of\nan internal clock variable.\nAll proposed solutions to the problem of time present\ntheir own conceptual and technical difficulties [6(c),9,17].\nIn this paper we point out that the BO-WKB and CPI\nschemes can be unified into a single framework, which is\nadvantageous because it entails only a small reinterpretation of the conventional quantum-mechanical formalism,\naffords a derivation of the TDSE without recourse to the\nBO approximation, and resolves various objections raised\non the original schemes. We work within the nonrelativistic formalism, but our development can be adapted\nto the quantum-gravitational realm.\nIn Sec. II, the observation that the TDSE can be interpreted as an equation of motion conditioned by the\nclassical state of a clock leads us to consider how the\nstate of the system, given that the clock is in a particular pure state, can be represented. In Sec. III we achieve\nthis rigorously by employing an exact factorization of the\ncomposite system's eigenfunction in terms of marginal\nand conditional amplitudes [18] for the clock variables\nand the remaining DOFs, respectively. Then, we employ\nthe Variation Principle to generate exact coupled equations for such amplitudes [19]. In Sec. IV, by introducing\nsuitable clocks we reduce the conditional equation to the\nTDSE. Then, in this context we analyze the conditions\nrequired by physical systems to serve as good clocks. In\nSec. V we critically discuss our development and its implications, in particular its advantages over the original\nBO-WKB and CPI schemes.\nII.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nLet us consider a quantum system with spatial coordinates x \u2261 x1 , x2 , . . .. The TDSE\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u0124(x, \u2212i~\u2207, t) \u2212 i~\n\u03a8(x|t) = 0\n(1)\n\u2202t\ndictates the evolution of its wavefunction with respect to\nthe time t, which is a parameter indicated by an external\nclassical clock. Although such clock \"ticks away\" practically oblivious of the system, for the very concept of\ntime to be meaningful there must exist at least a residual correlation between the quantal and classical states\nof the system and clock, respectively [6, 7], a situation\nthat we may call \"classical correlation\". Within the PI\nof quantum mechanics [2] such classical correlation can\nbe construed as meaning that \u03a8(x|t) is the conditional\nprobability amplitude for the system to be in configuration x provided that the clock is in the configuration\nparametrized by t [6], hence the bar we employ for separating the two kinds of variables. (For simplicity, when\nwe speak of the probability of a system to be \"in a particular configuration\" we actually mean \"in an infinitesimal neighborhood around a particular configuration\".)\n\n\f3\nTherefore, in light of these considerations we interpret\nthe TDSE (1) as a conditional equation of motion.\nSince the clock is constituted by atoms it must be ultimately governed by quantum laws as well. This elicits\ntwo closely related questions: First, how is it that the\nclock gets to behave classically so as to serve as a timeindicating device? This is the venerable problem of the\nclassical limit of quantum mechanics [1,2(b)]. Second,\nhow does the quantal correlation between the system and\nthe clock become a classical correlation? In this paper\nwe address the second question, taking for granted the\nclassical limit. In particular, we set out to demonstrate\nthat the TDSE is the dynamical law of evolution for the\nsystem that emerges in the classical limit from the conditional dependence of the configurational probability amplitude on the values of internal clock variables.\nWe begin by considering the system as a part of an essentially isolated composite quantum system, whose remaining part will eventually play the role of a clock. By\n\"essentially isolated\" we mean that the composite system neither interacts nor is correlated in any way with\nthe rest of the world [7], i.e. it is a \"universe\" in itself. Then, following other authors [6\u20138, 11, 13\u201317] we\npostulate that the composite system is in a Hamiltonian\neigenstate belonging to a Hilbert space H, i.e.\n\u0124\u03a6(x, R) = E\u03a6(x, R),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere R \u2261 R1 , R2 , . . . are the spatial coordinates of the\nclock. Thus, here we depart from Peres's view expressed\nin the third sentence of his statement quoted in Sec. I.\nNext, we conveniently partition the composite Hamiltonian as\n\u0124 = \u0124S (x\u0302, p\u0302) + \u0124C (R\u0302, P\u0302) + \u0124I (x\u0302, R\u0302),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the first and second terms are Hamiltonians for the\nsystem and clock, respectively, and the third term represents the interaction between them. This interaction\nmakes \u0124 nonseparable and, consequently, \u03a6(x, R) nonfactorizable into system and clock wavefunctions (pure\nstates). In other words, since the system and the clock,\nconsidered independently, are open their states must be\nimproper mixtures [2, 5]. Therefore, the state of the system (clock) irrespective of the state of the clock (system)\ncan be represented by a reduced density matrix [2, 5].\nNevertheless, to establish a connection with the conditional interpretation stated above, we must recognize\nthat if the clock is to indicate a definite time it must\nbe in a pure state. Then we pose the question: how\ncan the state of the system be represented given that the\nclock is in a pure state? Below we show that this can\nbe done compactly by means of a suitably defined conditional probability amplitude.\nBefore proceeding, it is necessary to clarify our language. Our framework of timelessness and essential isolation precludes the a priori incorporation of the conventional concept of measurement, simply because measurements are performed by observers at certain times, and\n\nforbids external observers, although internal ones could\nstill be considered a posteriori. That is why we adopt\na \"realist\" point of view and say that a system has a\nprobability of being in a certain configuration, instead of\nassuming an \"operational\" standpoint and saying that a\nsystem has a probability of being observed (measured)\nin a certain configuration [2(a)]. For classical systems\nthe two viewpoints are practically equivalent, but for\nquantal ones they are not. Hence, we are led to renounce the Copenhagen interpretation [2] and subscribe\nto the relative-state (or many-worlds) interpretation of\nthe wavefunction [2, 20], as is commonly done in quantum gravity and cosmology [9, 12, 13].\n\nIII.\nMARGINAL-CONDITIONAL\nFACTORIZATION OF THE JOINT\nEIGENFUNCTION\n\nWe postulate that |\u03a6(x, R)|2 provides the joint probability density for the system and the clock to be in configurations x and R, respectively:\n|\u03a6(x, R)|2 \u2261 \u03c1joint (x, R).\n\n(4)\n\nThis is a well-defined quantity because x and R commute. Moreover, it is well known that the latter can be\nexactly factorized as [2(b),5]\n\u03c1joint (x, R) = \u03c1mar (R)\u03c1con (x|R),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\u03c1mar (R) :=\n\nZ\n\ndx\u03c1joint (x, R)\n\n(6)\n\nis the marginal probability density for the clock to be\nin configuration R irrespective of the configuration of the\nsystem, and \u03c1con (x|R) is the conditional probability density for the system to be in configuration x provided that\nthe clock is in configuration R . (Throughout this paper,\nintegrals such as that appearing in Eq. (6) are understood to be definite over the entire pertinent configuration space). The normalization of \u03c1joint (x, R),\nZ\nZ\ndR dx\u03c1joint (x, R) = 1\n(7)\nautomatically implies the normalization of \u03c1mar (R) and\nthe local normalization of \u03c1con (x|R),\nZ\ndR\u03c1mar (R) = 1,\n(8)\nZ\n\ndx\u03c1con (x|R) = 1.\n\n(9)\n\nBy \"local\" we mean at a particular point of the R configuration space.\n\n\f4\nEq. (5) can be extracted from the basic expression of\nthe CPI [6], T r(P\u02c6A P\u02c6B \u03c1\u0302P\u02c6B ) = T r(P\u02c6B \u03c1\u0302P\u02c6B )p(A|B), where\np(A|B) is the conditional probability for the system to\nhave the value A of the observable \u00c2 given that the observable B\u0302 has the value B, \u03c1\u0302 is the density operator of\nthe composite system and P\u0302A(B) is the projection operator onto the \u00c2(B\u0302) subspace, by taking A = x, B = R,\nP\u0302x = |xihx|, P\u0302R = |RihR|, and \u03c1\u0302 = |\u03a6ih\u03a6|. Clearly,\n\u03c1\u0302joint = T r(P\u02c6x P\u02c6R \u03c1\u0302P\u02c6R ) and \u03c1\u0302mar = T r(P\u02c6R \u03c1\u0302P\u02c6R ).\nFollowing Hunter, we transfer the marginal-conditional\nfactorization (MCF) of \u03c1joint (x, R) to the joint probability amplitude [18]:\n\u03a6(x, R) = X(R)\u03a8(x|R).\n\n(10)\n\nThis factorization is exact as long as\n\u0012Z\n\u00131/2\nX(R) := ei\u03b1(R)\ndx|\u03a6(x, R)|2\n\u2261 ei\u03b1(R) h\u03a6(R)|\u03a6(R)i\n\n\u03a8(x|R) := e\u2212i\u03b1(R)\n\n1/2\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n\u03a6(x, R)\nh\u03a6(R)|\u03a6(R)i\n\n1/2\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nso that\n\u03c1mar (R) = |X(R)|2 ,\n\n(13)\n\n\u03c1con (x|R) = |\u03a8(x|R)|2 .\n\n(14)\n\n(From Eq. (11) onward we express integrals over the system configuration variables by means of angular brackets). The presence of the local phase ei\u03b1(R) , with \u03b1(R)\nreal, in the definitions (11) and (12) permits that X and\n\u03a8 be complex even if \u03a6 is real. The normalization conditions (7)-(9) now read\nZ\ndR h\u03a6(R)|\u03a6(R)i = 1,\n(15)\nZ\n\ndR|X(R)|2 = 1,\n\n(16)\n\nh\u03a8(R)|\u03a8(R)i = 1.\n\n(17)\n\nEvidently, X(R) = h\u03a8(R)|\u03a6(R)i and \u03a8(x|R) can be\ninterpreted as marginal and conditional probability amplitudes, respectively. It is quite remarkable that the joint\neigenfunction of the entangled system plus clock composite can be written in the product form (10), where\nthe (nonlocal, EPR) quantum correlations [2, 6, 7] of the\nsystem with the clock are embodied in the conditionalparametric dependence of \u03a8 on R . Hence, clearly \u03a8\nis not a wavefunction for the system in the conventional\nsense. To clarify the nature of this function let us first\n\nconsider the mean value of an observable pertaining to\nthe system alone:\nZ\nD\nE\nhAS i = dR \u03a6(R)|\u00c2S |\u03a6(R)\nZ\nD\nE\n= dR|X(R)|2 \u03a8(R)|\u00c2S |\u03a8(R) . (18)\n\nWe observe that hA\nD S i is the average\nE of the local quantities hAS (R)i \u2261 \u03a8(R)|\u00c2S |\u03a8(R) with the role of the\n\ndistribution function played by \u03c1mar [Eq. (13)]. Since\nhAS (R)i can be interpreted as a conditional expectation value we see that \u03a8(x|R) plays the role of a conditional wavefunction, from which conditional quantities for the system can be evaluated following the prescriptions of conventional quantum mechanics locally.\nWithin the relative-state interpretation [2, 20] this function plays the role of a conditional relative state. Furthermore,\ntaking into account Eq. (17) we observe that\nR\ndR h\u03a8(R)|\u03a8(R)i = V, with V the volume of the clock's\nconfiguration space. In Sec. IV we will see that a clock\ncan afford an infinite record of time only if V \u2192 \u221e,\nso in that case \u03a8(x|R) is not globally normalizable despite the fact that \u03a6(x, R) is. Therefore \u03a6 inhabits the\nHilbert space H = HS \u2297HC , while, in general, \u03a8 inhabits\nonly the local Hilbert space HS (R). On the other hand,\nX(R) is a genuine wavefunction for the clock, inhabiting\nthe Hilbert space HC , and we will call it the marginal\nwavefunction.\nThe global normalization of \u03a6(x, R) [Eq. (15)] together with the local normalization of \u03a8(x|R) [Eq. (17)]\nis all we need for a consistent PI of the formalism. Hence,\nour approach is free from the normalization problem afflicting the \"na\u0131\u0308ve\" PI [9].\nIt is worthwhile to mention the following point. For\nX(R) to have a zero at R0 \u03a6(x, R0 ) must vanish at\nall x [see Eq. (11)]. Moreover, in this case, for \u03a8(x|R0 )\nto be well behaved \u03a6(x, R) must approach zero faster\nthan X(R) as R \u2192 R0 at all x [see Eq. (10)]. This\nis an unlikely situation, so X(R) in general is a nodeless\nfunction. A more rigorous proof of this statement is given\nin Ref. [21].\nWe now apply the Variation Principle \u03b4h\u0124i = 0 to the\nderivation of the equations that govern the behavior of\nX(R) and \u03a8(x|R) . Following Gidopoulos and Gross [19]\nwe set up the functional\nZ\nD\nE\nL[\u03a6] \u2261 dR \u03a6(R)|\u0124|\u03a6(R)\nZ\n\u2212 dR\u03bb(R) (h\u03a8(R)|\u03a8(R)i \u2212 1)\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\n2\n\u2212\u01eb\ndR|X(R)| \u2212 1 ,\n(19)\nwhere the first term is the expectation value of the composite system's energy, the second term ensures the local\nnormalization of \u03a8(x|R) at every point of R-space and\nthe third term ensures the normalization of X(R), with\n\n\f5\n\u03bb(R) and \u01eb being local and global Lagrange multipliers,\nrespectively. By imposing the extremization condition\n\u03b4L = 0 we obtain\n\u0012\nE\nD\nE\u0013\nXD\n\u03a8|m\u22121\nP\u0302\n|\u03a8\nP\u0302\n+\n\u03a8|\n\u0124\n+\n\u0124\n+\n\u0124\n|\u03a8\nT\u0302C +\nn\nn\nS\nI\nC\nn\nn\n\n\u00d7 X(R) = \u01ebX(R),\n\n(20)\n\n#\n#\u0013\n\"\n\"\n\u0012\nX m\u22121 P\u0302n X\nT\u0302\nX\nC\nn\n\u0124S +\u0124I + \u0124C +\nP\u0302n +\nX\nX\nn\n\u00d7 \u03a8(x|R) =\n\n\u03bb(R)\n\u03a8(x|R),\n\u03c1mar\n\n(21)\n\n\u01eb =\n\nR\n\nif the phase carried by \u03a8(x|R) is independent of R. We\ncall \"effective clock potential\" the quantity\nD\nE\nUC (R) \u2261 VC (R) + \u03a8(R)|\u0124S + \u0124I + T\u0302C |\u03a8(R)\nD\nE\n= \u03a8(R)|\u0124|\u03a8(R) ,\n(22)\nwith VC (R) being the potential present in \u0124C , which is\nseen to be analogous to a BO potential-energy surface. In\nthe conditional equation (21) the fourth and fifth terms of\nthe effective Hamiltonian are local kinetic and potential\ncouplings of the system with the clock, respectively.\nIn addition, let us left-multiply Eq. (20) by X\u2217 (R)\nand then integrate over R , taking into account Eq.\n(16). With a little additional manipulation this yields\n\nNext, let us left-\n\n\u2217\n\nmultiply Eq. (21) by \u03c1mar (R)\u03a8 (x|R) and then integrate over x and R, taking into account Eqs. (16)\nand (17).\nComparison\nof both results indicates that\nR\nR\nE = dR\u03bb(R) = dR\u03c1mar (\u03bb(R)/\u03c1mar (R)) , so that\n\u03bb(R)/\u03c1mar can be interpreted as a local energy.\nIt is worthwhile to notice that if \u0124I vanishes identically, so that \u03a8 becomes independent of R , then Eq. (20)\nbecomes the TISE for the isolated clock, with EC = \u01eb,\nand Eq. (21), after multiplication by \u03c1mar followed by\nintegration over R,R becomes the TISE for the isolated\nsystem, with ES = dR\u03bb(R) \u2212 EC .\nIV.\n\nwith mn and P\u0302n being the mass and momentum operator\nclock's n-th DOF, respectively, and T\u0302C =\nP of the\n\u22121 2\nP\u0302n the clock's kinetic-energy operator. In\nn (2mn )\nEqs. (20) and (21) an operator within an angularbracketed or square-bracketed expression, respectively,\nacts only on the function in front of it.\nAt the outset we make the following observations about\nthese equations: First, they constitute a pair of exact\ncoupled pseudoeigenvalue equations, where the terms in\nparentheses on their left-hand sides play the roles of effective clock and system Hamiltonians, with X and \u03a8\nbeing the respective eigenfunctions. (Note that X and\n\u03a8 are not eigenfunctions of Hamiltonians analogous to\nthe nuclear and electronic ones appearing in the context of the BO approximation [8(a,b)].) Second, since\nthe effective Hamiltonians are Hermitian the Lagrange\nmultipliers \u01eb and \u03bb(R) are real. Third, together with\nEqs. (11) and (12), they afford the local gauge freedom\nX(R) \u2192 ei\u03b3(R) X(R), \u03a8(x|R) \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b3(R) \u03a8(x|R), with\n\u03b3(R) real, leaving \u03a6(x, R) invariant. Finally, since X\nand \u03a8 are unique up to a phase, for a given \u03a6, each one\nof them possesses only one acceptable solution.\nLet us now analyze the terms of these equations. In the\nmarginal equation (20) the second and third terms of the\neffective Hamiltonian are mean-field kinetic and potential\ncouplings of the clock with the system,\nrespectively.\nThe\nD\nE\nvector-potential-like mean field \u03a8|m\u22121\nP\u0302\n|\u03a8\nvanishes\nn\nn\n\nD\nE\ndR \u03a6(R)|\u0124|\u03a6(R) = E .\n\nCLOCKS AND THE UNRAVELING OF\nTHE TDSE\n\nEq. (21) can be interpreted as an \"equation of motion\"\nfor the system's quantum state with respect to the clock\nvariables consistent with the TISE (2). However, clearly\nthis equation lacks evolution since it does not involve a\nlaw that organizes the values of R in a specific sequence.\nFor the subsystem we have been calling \"the clock\" to\nactually deserve that title it must provide such a law.\nWe call an \"ideal clock\" a system that can indicate a\ndefinite time and provide an infinite record of it. Even\nif ideal clocks do not exist, the empirical fact that the\nTDSE provides a superb approximation for the description of nonrelativistic quantum phenomena in conventional laboratory settings [1] guarantees that at least\ngood approximations to them do exist.\nThe present formalism does not involve the introduction of a time operator, which can be problematic\n[3, 4, 10, 17]. Instead, in Eq. (21) time must somehow\nemerge from the coupling of the system with the clock,\nwhich depends explicitly on the nature of the marginal\nwavefunction X(R).\nThe TDSE can be derived from Eqs. (20) and (21) following the same strategy as in the BO-WKB approach\n[8, 9, 11]: first Eq. (20) is adiabatically decoupled from\nEq. (21), then the WKB approximation for X(R) is used,\nand finally the classical limit for the clock variables in Eq.\n(21) is taken. Here we revisit this approach following a\n\"reverse-engineering\" procedure, i.e., we assume the existence of ideal clocks and then determine the approximations required for the emergence of the TDSE from\nEq. (21). Then we critically analyze the conditions under\nwhich typical physical systems can approach ideal clocks.\nThis will turn out to be an instructive exercise.\nLet us first consider a linear clock [8(a),10(b)]. A simplified physical realization of such a clock is a structureless ball moving freely, say in the Z direction, along a\nruler with equally-spaced markings. The \"ticking\" corresponds to the consecutive passing of the ball by the\nmarkings. The marginal eigenfunction then is the plane\nwave\nX(R) \u2192 Ae\u00b1iPZ0 Z/~ ,\n\n(23)\n\n\f6\nwith A being the constant amplitude and PZ0 being the\nmomentum eigenvalue of the ball. Substitution of Eq.\n(23) into Eq. (21) yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\nPZ0\nP2\n\u03bb(Z)\n\u0124S +\u0124I + T\u0302C \u00b1\nP\u0302Z + Z0 \u2212\nm\n2m\n|A|2\n\u00d7 \u03a8(x|Z) = 0,\n(24)\n2\nPZ0\n/2m are the mass and kinetic energy of\nVC (Z) was set equal to zero since the ball\n\nwhere m and\nthe ball, and\nis free. In the classical limit PZ0 = h/\u03bb \u2192 \u221e, PZ0 =\nm\u017b and, integrating, Z(t) = Z(0) + m\u22121 PZ0 t, where the\noverdot represents the derivative with respect to time.\nBy noticing that [8]\n(\u017b P\u0302Z )\u03a8 = \u2212i~\n\ndZ \u2202\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u03a8 = \u2212i~\n,\ndt \u2202Z\n\u2202t\n\n(25)\n\nwe thus obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~2 1 \u2202 2\n\u2202\nm\u017b 2\n\u03bb(t)\n\u0124S +\u0124I (x, t) \u2212\n\u2213 i~ \u00b1\n\u2212\n2m \u017b 2 \u2202t2\n\u2202t\n2\n|A|2\n\u00d7 \u03a8(x|t) = 0,\n(26)\nwhere the dependence on Z(t) was equivalently expressed\nas a dependence on t. This is a differential equation of\nsecond order in the spatial and temporal variables for the\nquantum state of the system conditioned by the classical state of the clock, the latter being parametrized by\nt and characterized by the constant momentum of the\nball. The exactness of this equation depends only on the\nprecision with which the physical clock approximates an\nideal classical linear clock.\nOn taking the classical limit above time was introduced\nas a continuous parameter. Since the clock's ticking is\ndiscrete, this presupposes also taking the limit of the\nspacing between the markings going to zero. But nothing\nprevents us from working with a discrete time parameter\n[10(a,b)], which would turn Eq. (26) into a differentialdifference equation. Since our goal is to derive the (differential) TDSE, for now we will stick to a continuous\ntime.\nThe classical PZ0 = m\u017b \u2192 \u221e limit allows three possibilities: (i) m \u2192 \u221e, \u017b \u2192 \u221e, (ii) m finite, \u017b \u2192 \u221e, and\n(iii) m \u2192 \u221e, \u017b finite. In all three cases the third term of\nEq. (26) vanishes (unless \u03a8\u0308 \u2192 \u221e, a possibility we do not\nentertain since we assume that \u03a8 is well behaved). However, under typical laboratory conditions cases (i) and\n(ii) are not realistic because the speed of the classical\nball is very small in comparison with the average speeds\nof the particles making up the quantal system. To analyze the more realistic case (iii) we first note that in the\nm \u2192 \u221e, \u017b \u2192 0 limit the third term remains finite only\nif \u03a8\u0308 \u221d \u017b l , with l \u2265 2. But \u03a8\u0308 should depend smoothly\non \u017b, so if \u017b & 0 then \u03a8\u0308 & 0 too. Therefore, in this case\nthe time variations of \u03a8 are very smooth.\nAfter neglecting the third term of Eq. (26), the last\ntwo terms can be eliminated by the gauge transformation\n[8]\ni\n\n\u03a8(x|t) = e ~\n\n\u0010\n\nm\u017b 2 t\n\u2213\n2\n\nRt\n\n\u0011\n\u03bb(t\u2032 )\ndt\u2032\n|A|2\n\n\u03a8\u0303(x|t),\n\n(27)\n\nwhich finally produces the (first-order) TDSE for the system's gauged conditional wavefunction,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u0124S + \u0124I (x, t) \u2213 i~\n\u03a8\u0303(x|t) = 0.\n(28)\n\u2202t\nSeveral comments about this equation are in order. First,\nit emerges independently of the eigenvalue E in Eqs. (2)\nand (20); in particular, since the zero of energy is conventional, we could set E = 0 in analogy with the Hamiltonian constraint of quantum gravity [9, 12]. Second, the\nsign of the time-derivative term is dictated by the sign of\nthe exponent in Eq. (23), which is conventional as well.\nThus, just like the distinction between forward and backward motion in Eq. (23) is meaningless, the distinction\nbetween past and future in Eq. (28) is also meaningless\n[13]. Third, if \u0124I \u2248 0, i.e., if there is only a residual\ninteraction between the system and the clock (all that\nis needed to establish the classical correlation alluded to\nin Sec. II) the time-derivative term remains, as it originates from the \"chronogenic\" fourth term in the lefthand side of Eq. (21), independently of the strength of\nthe interaction. However, in this case the time-derivative\nterm can be removed by the simple phase transformation\n\u03a8\u0303(x|t) = e\u2213iES t/~ \u03c8(x), which produces the TISE for the\nsystem \u0124S \u03c8(x) = ES \u03c8(x) [1, 8].\nLet us now examine the conditions under which our\nphysical clock can approximate the ideal linear clock.\nEvidently the plane wave (23) can beD a solution of\nE Eq.\n\n(20) with good approximation only if \u03a8|m\u22121\nn P\u0302n |\u03a8 \u2248 0\nand UC \u2248 const [see Eq. (22)]. The first condition\ncan be met only if the R variations of \u03a8 are very much\nsmoother than the ones of X. This is indeed the case because the ball, being classical, possesses a comparatively\nvery small de Broglie wavelength \u03bb, whereas, according\nto the discussion above Eq. (27), the R variations of \u03a8,\nwhich dictate its time variations (\u03a8\u0307 \u2248 const), are very\nsmooth. This\nin turn implies that\nD\nE T\u0302C \u03a8 \u2248 0, so that\nUC (R) \u2248 \u03a8(R)|\u0124S + \u0124I |\u03a8(R) which, for the reason\njust explained, can be considered as nearly constant as\nfar as X(R) is concerned. The neglect of the R variations\nof \u03a8 in Eq. (20) constitutes an adiabatic approximation,\nwhich means that the back-reaction of the system on the\nclock is only potential, not kinetic. On the other hand,\nin Eq. (21) the R variations of \u03a8 were kept at least\nup to first order to get the TDSE. Hence, the system\nis kinetically affected by the clock. These asymmetrical influences are possible only if the energy of the clock\n(m\u1e582 /2) is very much larger than the one of the system [7, 8, 11], which in our case is consistent with the\ncondition m \u2192 \u221e, \u017b & 0 stated above.\nThe ideal-clock ansatz (23) violates the normalization\nconditions (15)-(17). To make X(Z) \u2208 HC and recover these conditions the amplitude can be considered\nto be actually a slowly-varying envelope function, so that\ndA/dZ \u2248 0, A(Z \u2192 \u00b1\u221e) \u2192 0, and Eq. (24) is a good\napproximation. Then, Eq. (23) is just the WKB approx-\n\n\f7\nimation [1, 8, 9, 11]. Now, according to Eq. (17) the normalization of the time-dependent wavefunction at each\ninstant of time is guaranteed:\nD\nE\nh\u03a8(R)|\u03a8(R)i \u2192 h\u03a8(t)|\u03a8(t)i = \u03a8\u0303(t)|\u03a8\u0303(t) = 1. (29)\nR\nThe fact that the global integral dt h\u03a8(t)|\u03a8(t)i diverges, because V \u2192 \u221e for a linear clock, is immaterial\nfor the consistency of this development [see the discussion\nfollowing Eq. (18)].\nThe linear clock has the drawback that in practice the\nball will eventually bounce from an obstacle, so this system can afford only a finite record of time. Let us explore\na scattering-free model, the cyclic clock [10(b)]. The\narchetypical physical realization of this clock is a structureless handle moving at constant angular speed over a\ncircular framework, say in the XY plane, with markings\nat regular angular intervals. In this case the marginal\neigenfunction can be expressed as\nX(R) \u2192 Ae\u00b1iLZ0 \u03c6/~ ,\n\n(30)\n\nwith \u03c6 and LZ0 = m~ (m = \u00b10, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . .) being the\nazimuthal angle and perpendicular component of the angular momentum of the handle. Substitution of Eq.\n(30) into Eq. (21) yields an equation similar to Eq.\n(24), except that the fourth and fifth terms are replaced\nby \u00b1I \u22121 LZ0 L\u0302Z \u03a8(x|\u03c6) and (L2Z0 /2I)\u03a8(x|\u03c6), with I and\nL2Z0 /2I being the moment of inertia and rotational kinetic energy of the handle. Taking the classical limit\nLZ0 = I \u03c6\u0307, \u03c6(t) = \u03c6(0) + I \u22121 LZ0 t, using the chain rule\n(\u03c6\u0307L\u0302Z )\u03a8 = \u2212i~(d\u03c6/dt)(\u2202/\u2202\u03c6)\u03a8 = \u2212i~\u03a8\u0307, neglecting the\nthird term, and performing the gauge transformation\nanalogous to Eq. (27) finally produces\nthe TDSE (28)\nR\nagain. Since the global integral d\u03c6 h\u03a8(\u03c6)|\u03a8(\u03c6)i = V =\n2\u03c0, now the time-dependent wavefunction is normalizable\nwith respect to time. The conditions under which this\nphysical system can approximate the ideal cyclic clock\nare completely analogous to the ones for the linear clock.\nNevertheless, this clock is able to indicate time\nuniquely only for 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0 (mod 2\u03c0). To extend\nits range of applicability we supplement it with a second\nhandle (say the minutes one) independent from the first\nhandle (say the seconds one):\nX(R) \u2192 AeiL10 \u03c61 /~ eiL20 \u03c62 /~ .\n\n(31)\n\nFor simplicity, we used only the positive sign in the exponent and will assume that the handles have the same\nmoment of inertia. Substitution of this equation into Eq.\n(21) yields an equation analogous to Eq. (24), whose\nfourth term is I \u22121 (L10 L\u03021 + L20 L\u03022 )\u03a8(x|\u03c61 , \u03c62 ). By construction, in the classical limit the first handle performs\nan integer number of cycles C1 within each cycle of the\nsecond handle, which requires L10 = C1 L20 . Using the\n\nchain rule the fourth term becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03c61 \u2202\nd\u03c62 \u2202\n(\u03c6 \u03071 L\u03021 + \u03c6 \u03072 L\u03022 )\u03a8 = \u2212i~\n\u03a8\n+\ndt \u2202\u03c61\ndt \u2202\u03c62\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndR\n= \u2212i~\n*\u2207 \u03a8\ndt\n\u2202\u03a8\n,\n(32)\n= \u2212i~\n\u2202t\nwhere R = \u03c61 \u00ea1 + \u03c62 \u00ea2 and \u2207 = (\u2202/\u2202\u03c61 )\u00ea1 + (\u2202/\u2202\u03c62 )\u00ea2 ,\nwith \u00ea1 and \u00ea2 being unit vectors. Note that had we\ntaken the right-hand side of the first equality to be\n\u2212i~(\u2202/\u2202t + \u2202/\u2202t)\u03a8 = \u22122i~\u03a8\u0307 we would have gotten a\nspurious factor of 2. The choice of Eq. (32) is the correct\none since it considers the motion of the clock's state in\nconfiguration 2-space, instead of separate motions of each\nDOF in their respective 1-spaces, as it should because the\ntime-dependent wavefunction is defined on the configuration space of the system, not on the physical space. Since\nthe classical trajectory in configuration space returns to\nthe same point after C1 cycles of the fast handle, now\nthis clock can indicate time uniquely for 0 \u2264 \u03c61 \u2264 C1 2\u03c0\n(mod C1 2\u03c0). Clearly, for a cyclic clock to be able to provide an infinite record of time it must possess an infinite\nnumber of handles. In this limit the clock's configuration space has an infinite volume and the time-dependent\nwavefunction\nis no longer normalizable with respect to\nR\ntime, dt h\u03a8(t)|\u03a8(t)i \u2192 \u221e.\nWe can also consider any combination of linear and cyclic clocks, for example X(Z, \u03c6) =\nAZ eiPZ0 Z/~ A\u03c6 eiLZ0 \u03c6/~ , which, according to the discussion above, is also able to provide a global time and give\nrise to the TDSE (28).\nThe last two examples convey two important messages:\nFirst, if a clock has N DOFs its configuration N -space\nstill defines a global time through the chronogenic fourth\nterm in the left-hand side of Eq. (21). This is relevant\nbecause realistic instruments always interact with their\nenvironments, and since we are considering an essentially\nisolated composite system, we have to take into account\nsuch environment as part of the clock. This observation\ndoes not clash with the possibility of obtaining a multiple-TDSE by successively shifting the quantal/classical\nboundary for selected variables [8(d)]. Second, a periodic\nsystem cannot provide an infinite record of time, since\nits trajectory in configuration space eventually returns\nto the same point, but a chaotic system can.\nThe linear and cyclic clocks studied above involve\nforce-free motions (although in the latter there is a constraint). To see if a system involving a force can constitute a good clock as well, let us examine the harmonic\nclock [8(c)], a simplified physical realization of which is a\nstructureless ball moving in a one-dimensional parabolic\npotential. We first point out that to be able to synchronize this system with a force-free clock the spacing\nbetween markings along the physical trajectory of the\nball can no longer be regular but must be adjusted according to its acceleration so that the ticks correspond\nto regular time intervals. In regions where the de Broglie\n\n\f8\nwavelength of the ball is sufficiently short the marginal\neigenfunction can be approximated by Eq. (23). Now\nthe equation analogous to Eq. (26) contains the additional term (~2 Z\u0308/2m\u017b 3 )\u03a8\u0307(t), but the TDSE (28) can\nstill be derived from it following a procedure similar to\nthe one employed for the linear clock [8(c)]. However,\nthe WKB approximation breaks down around the classical turning points [1], so it would seem that the TDSE\nemerged only away from such points. This breakdown is\na strong objection raised on the semiclassical approach\nin the context of quantum gravity [9]. It seems to us\nthat this objection arises from the assumption that time\nmust be a continuous parameter. Nevertheless, if one\nconsiders a discrete time parameter, as discussed earlier,\ntaking care to not place markings too near the turning\npoints, this problem can be avoided. Afterwards, if desired, a continuous time parameter can be recovered by\ninterpolation. Similar considerations can be made for\nsystems with more complicated forces. At any rate, for\nthe harmonic model Briggs and coworkers have elegantly\nshown that the turning-point issue can be circumvented\nby employing the coherent-states representation of the\nharmonic mode amplitude [8(c)]. Nevertheless, it must\nbe noted that this system by itself cannot provide an infinite record of time either (be it discrete or continuous),\ndue to the periodicity of the trajectory or the amplitude.\nIn conclusion, the TDSE can emerge either from analog\n(continuous) or digital (discrete) clocks.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have accomplished our goal of demonstrating that\nthe TDSE is the dynamical evolution law unraveled in\nthe classical limit from a timeless formulation in terms\nof configurational probability amplitudes conditioned by\nthe values of appropriately chosen internal clock variables. In so doing, we have unified the CPI [6] and BOWKB [8, 11] schemes in a single framework.\nThe pair of basic Eqs. (20) and (21), first derived by\nGidopoulos and Gross [19], involve three main ingredients: (i) the postulate that the state of our essentially\nisolated composite system is governed by the TISE (2);\n(ii) the PI of the square modulus of the joint eigenfunction, Eq. (4); and (iii) Hunter's MCF of the joint eigenfunction, Eq. (10) [18].\nIngredients (i) and (ii) are part of the original CPI, but\n(iii) is a departure from that approach, which is advantageous for the following reasons. First, the CPI is based\non conditional probabilities and the factorization (5), entailing a modification of the standard formalism of timedependent quantum mechanics, whereas our approach is\nbased on conditional amplitudes, leaving essentially intact such a formalism, although calling for a small reinterpretation thereof. Second, in the BO-WKB approach\nthe ansatz resembling Eq. (10) is obtained from an expansion of the joint eigenfunction in an adiabatic basis and a subsequent decoupling of the system and clock\n\nwavefunctions, requiring the introduction of a largely unspecified average clock potential [8]. To us such detour is\nunnecessary since Eq. (10) is exact. Furthermore, in the\nBO ansatz the system and clock have become disentangled, whereas in the MCF they still are fully entangled.\nThe subsequent unraveling of the TDSE from the exact conditional Eq. (21) involves three additional ingredients: (iv) the existence of good clocks [e.g. Eqs. (23),\n(30) and (31)], which is the basis of the so-called semiclassical approach in the field of quantum gravity [9, 11],\njustified by the adiabatic approximation; (v) the classical limit of the clock variables; and (vi) the neglect of\ntime derivatives of order higher than first [like the one\nappearing in Eq. (26)], justified in the limit of low rate\nof change of the clock variables. Ingredients (v) and (vi)\nare consistent with (iv) if the masses (or related quantities, e.g. moments of inertia) associated with the clock\nvariables are very large.\nRelaxation of (vi) entails dealing with a (KleinGordon-like) \"second-order TDSE\" and all the interpretational problems it conveys [22]. According to the discussion above Eq. (27) these higher-order corrections\nshould be very small in laboratory conditions, although\nanalogous terms may become important in relativistic\ncontexts [9].\nIf the requirements necessary for the validity of the\nclassical limit (v) are not fully satisfied it is not possible to obtain a well-defined time parameter through the\nchain rule of Eq. (25). However, if the adiabatic approximation is still valid, Eq. (24) (with or without T\u0302C )\nprovides an effective \"equation of motion\" with respect\nto the clock variables.\nIf the R variations of \u03a8 do not happen to be very\nmuch smoother than the ones of X, the adiabatic approximation, with its associated neglect of the kinetic backreaction of the system on the clock, breaks down and the\nWKB approximation (iv) is invalidated [9, 11]. To exactly account for this effect we have to fall back to the\nbasic Eqs. (20) and (21), which contain all the systemclock couplings explicitly. In principle, self-consistent solutions of these equations can be constructed in an iterative fashion, analogously to the way the Hartree-Fock\nequations are solved in many-body theory. Within the\noriginal BO-WKB framework, the prospect of treating\nthe system-clock couplings employing a Hartree-Fock-like\nself-consistent approach has already been pointed out by\nAnderson [11(c)]. Clearly, our treatment rigorously substantiates Anderson's notion.\nWithin refined versions of the CPI, the consequences\nof the clock's nonideality have been treated from a different perspective by Gambini and coworkers [15], who\nhave shown that the equation of motion for the system's\nreduced density matrix contains a weak Lindblad-type\nterm, causing the evolution to be not exactly unitary\nand, consequently, initial pure states to slowly decohere\ninto mixed states. A direct calculation of the minimum\ndecoherence has been performed by Corbin and Cornish\n[16]. In our approach, either at the exact or approximate\n\n\f9\nlevels of Eqs. (21) or (24), respectively, decoherence does\nnot arise because the quantum state, X(R), of the clock\nis fully determinate.\nIt may be objected that the model clocks employed\nin Sec. IV are too simplistic. After all, the quantum\nsystems studied in laboratories are not \"classically correlated\" with such simple devices but with the surrounding\nenvironment (which may include an actual clock). However, those examples teach us that any system whose configuration space possesses a subset of\nsemiclassical\nvari\u2032\n\u2032\nables R\u2032 , so that X(R) = \u03c7(R\u2032\u2032 )e\u00b1iP0 *R /~ , where \u03c7(R\u2032\u2032 )\nis a slowly-varying function of the remaining DOFs,\n[P\u0302n\u2032 , R\u0302n\u2032 ] = i~, and P0\u2032 = ~/\u03bb\u2032 \u2192 \u221e, can serve as an\napproximate clock. Since any realistic environment is\nmacroscopic (N \u2192 \u221e) and non-periodic, taking into\naccount the discussion in the penultimate paragraph of\nSec. IV we conclude that the environment surrounding a\nquantum system provides the global time needed for the\nrise of the TDSE.\nIt has been pointed out that it is unclear how the a\nposteriori PI of the BO-WKB approach is related to the\na priori PI of the underlying TISE (or Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation) [9]. Our formulation clarifies this issue because\nthe PI of the square modulus of the time-dependent wavefunction emerges automatically from the combination of\nthe PI of the square modulus of the joint eigenfunction\n[Eq. (4)], the MCF [Eq. (10)] and the classical limit of\nthe clock variables.\nThe validity of the original CPI has been forcefully\nquestioned by Kucha\u0159, on grounds that upon application\nof the condition the state gets knocked out of the Hilbert\nspace, and, consequently, a \"frozen\" propagator related\nto the question \"If one finds the particle at x0 at the time\nt0 , what is the probability of finding it at x1 at the time\nt1 > t0 ?\" is predicted [6(c),9(a)]. Refined versions of the\n\nCPI have been shown to be capable of answering correctly\nthis question [14, 15]. In the present context Kucha\u0159's\nobjection would mean that conditioning the clock to be\nin a particular configuration R\u2032 would collapse its state\nto the distributional state \u03b4(R \u2212 R\u2032 ). In our formulation\nthis is not so, because such conditioning entails simply\nthe evaluation at R = R\u2032 of X(R) \u2208 HC , \u03a8(x|R) \u2208\nHS (R), and \u03a6(x, R) \u2208 HS \u2297 HC . Furthermore, since our\nformulation is ultimately capable of yielding the TDSE, it\nnaturally predicts the correct nonrelativistic propagator.\nThere is one final issue that we wish to emphasize. As\nmentioned earlier, the conditional Eq. (21) [or its approximate version Eq. (24)] lacks evolution. Thus, the\nsystem simply is in all its possible conditional states;\nin Wootters's words, its history is \"condensed\" [6(b)].\nThen, by introducing the WKB approximation followed\nby the classical limit, a \"sleight of hand\", time, and\nwith it causality and history, magically appeared in Eq.\n(26) [22]. Thus, in a semiclassical approach the TDSE\nemerges phenomenologically because the classical limit of\nthe clock variables is taken for granted. A first-principles\ntheory should explain how (classical) time emerges in a\nsystem from the internal spatial quantum correlations\n[6, 7, 12]. That is to say that the classical limit of quantum mechanics should be sought from the TISE, not from\nthe TDSE, which is already partly classical, as is commonly done [1,2(b)]. A hint as to what this theory may\nbe like has been provided by Barbour [13].\n\n[1] J.E. Bayfield, Quantum Evolution.
