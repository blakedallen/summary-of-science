Kaluza's hypothesis was that the world has\nfour spatial dimensions, but one of the dimensions has curled up to form a circle so small as to\nbe unobservable. He showed that ordinary general relativity in five dimensions, assuming such\na cylindrical ground state, contained a local U(1) gauge symmetry arising from the isometry\nof the hidden fifth dimension. The extra components of the metric tensor constitute the gauge\nfields of this symmetry and could be identified with the electromagnetic vector potential.\nTo be more specific, consider general relativity on a five dimensional space-time with the\nEinstein-Hilbert action\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nd5 x \u2212g5 R5\n(1.1)\nS=\u2212\n16\u03c0GK\nwhere R5 is the five-dimensional curvature scalar of the metric gAB , g5 = det(gAB ), and GK is the\nfive-dimensional coupling constant. Our conventions are: upper case Latin letters A, B, C denote\nfive-dimensional indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 5; lower case Greek indices \u03bc, \u03bd . . . run over four dimensions,\n0, 1, 2, 3, whereas lower case Latin indices run over four-dimensional spatial values 1, 2, 3, 5. The\nsignature of gAB is (\u2212, +, +, +, +) and the Riemann tensor is\nRKLM N = \u2202M \u0393KLN \u2212 \u2202N \u0393KLM + \u0393KJM \u0393JLN \u2212 \u0393KJN \u0393JLM\nRLM = RKLKM ,\n\nR5 = RLL ,\n\nand, except where indicated, h/2\u03c0 = c = 1. In the absence of other fields the equations of\nmotion are of course RAB = 0.\n\u2217\n\nTalk given at the '88 Schloss Hofen Meeting on Symmetries in Science III.

The radius of the\ncircle in the fifth dimension is undetermined by the classical equations of motion, since any circle\nis flat. If R is sufficiently small then all low-energy experiments will simply average over the\nfifth dimension. In fact the components of the metric, gAB (x\u03bc , x5 ), can be expanded in Fourier\nseries,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX (n)\ninx5\n\u03bc 5\n\u03bc\ngAB (x , x ) =\ngAB (x ) exp\n,\n(1.2)\nR\nn\nand all modes with n 6= 0 will have energies greater than hc/R. Thus the effective low-energy\ntheory can be deduced by considering the metric gAB to be independent of x5 . Under these\nassumptions the theory is invariant under general coordinate transformations that are independent of x5 . In addition to ordinary four dimensional coordinate transformations x\u03bc \u2192 x\u03bc (x\u03bd ),\nwe have a U(1) local gauge transformation x5 \u2192 x5 + \u039b(x\u03bc ), under which g\u03bc5 transforms as a\nvector gauge field,\ng\u03bc5 (x) \u2192 g\u03bc5 (x) + \u2202\u03bc \u039b.\n(1.3)\nTherefore the low-energy theory should be a theory of four dimensional gravity plus a U (1)\ngauge theory, i.e. electromagnetism, with the massless modes of g\u03bc\u03bd , g\u03bc5 corresponding to the\ngraviton (photon). The low-energy theory is also invariant under scale transformations in the\nfifth dimension,\nx5 \u2192 \u03bbx5 ,\ng55 \u2192 \u03bb\u22122 g55 ,\ng\u03bc5 \u2192 \u03bb\u22121 g\u03bc5 .\n(1.4)\nThis global scale invariance is spontaneously broken by the Kaluza-Klein vacuum (since R is\nfixed) thus giving rise to a Goldstone boson, the dilaton.\nTo exhibit the low-energy theory we write the metric as follows\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ng\u03bc\u03bd + A\u03bc A\u03bd A\u03bc V\n\uf8f8,\ngAB = \uf8ed\nA\u03bd V\nV\n(1.5)\ng5\n= detgAB = det(g\u03bc\u03bd )V = g4 V,\nds2\n\n= V (dx5 + A\u03bc dx\u03bc )2 + g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd .\n\nThe five-dimensional curvature scalar can be expressed in terms of the four dimensional curvature, R4 , the field strength, F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc , and the scalar field, V ,\n2\nR5 = R4 + 14 V F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u221a\nV\n\n\u221a\nV .\n\n(1.6)\n\nThus the effective low energy theory is described by the four dimensional action\nZ\n\u0001\n\u221a\n1\nS=\u2212\nd4 x \u2212g4 V 1/2 R4 + 14 V F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd ,\n(1.7)\n16\u03c0G\n\u221a\nwhere we have dropped the terms in R5 involving V , since, when multiplied by g5 , these yield\na total derivative, and\nGK\nG=\n(1.8)\n2\u03c0R\n\u221a\n\u221a\nis Newton's constant, determined by hG/ 2\u03c0c3 \u2248 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221233 cm.\nThis theory is recognizable as a variant of the Brans-Dicke theory [3] of gravity, with V 1/2\nidentified as a Brans\u2013Dicke massless scalar field, coupled to electromagnetism. V indeed sets the\nlocal scale of the gravitational coupling. In the vacuum V = 1. Also in the Brans\u2013Dicke theory\n2\n\n\fthe coupling of V to matter is somewhat arbitrary, here it is totally fixed by five-dimensional\ncovariance. The radius R is determined by the electric charge. To see this consider a complex\nfield \u03a6 with action\nZ\n\u221a\nS\u03a6 = d5 x \u2212g5 (\u2202A \u03a6)(\u2202 A \u03a6\u2020 ).\n(1.9)\nThe Fourier component of\u221a\u03a6 with non-trivial x5 dependence, \u03a6(n) (x\u03bc ) exp[inx5 /R], will behave\nas a particle of charge e = 16\u03c0Gn/R and mass n/R, since for \u03a6(x\u03bc , x5 ) = \u03a6(n) (x\u03bc ) exp[inx5 /R]\n\u2202A \u03a6\u2202 A \u03a6\u2020 =\n\n\u0010\n\nn \u0011\n\u2202\u03bc + i A\u03bc \u03a6(n)\nR\n\n2\n\n+\n\nn2\n2\n\u03a6(n) .\nV R2\n\n(Note that the properly normalized gauge field is (16\u03c0G)\u22121/2 A\u03bc ). Thus\nr\n2hG\n\u2248 3.7 \u00d7 10\u221232 cm.\n\u03b1 = e2 /2hc = 2hG/\u03c0c3 R2 ,\nR=\n\u03c0\u03b1c3\nConsider a classical point test particle of unit mass.

We recognize on the right\nthe Lorentz force if q is identified with the charge of the particle, plus an interaction with the\nscalar field V .\n\n2\n\nTHE MONOPOLE OF GROSS, PERRY AND SORKIN [2]\n\nNow we are searching for solitons in the five-dimensional Kaluza - Klein theory sketched above.\nBy a soliton we mean a non-singular solution to the classsical field equations which represent\nspatially localized lumps that are topologically stable. Such solutions are expected to have a\nlarge mass (of the order M/g, where M is the mass scale of the theory and g a dimensionless\ncoupling constant). They are the starting points for the semi-classical construction of quantum\nmechanical particle states.\nOur goal is to construct solutions of the five dimensional field equations that approach the\nvacuum solution: V = 1, A\u03bc = 0, g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd at spatial infinity. It is natural to consider static\n3\n\n\fmetrics with \u2202/\u2202t as Killing vector. It is also natural to look for solutions with g0A = \u03b40A . In\nthis case the space-time is totally flat in the 'time' direction and the field equations are simply\nRij = R5i = R55 = 0,\n\n(2.1)\n\nnamely the four-dimensional, wholly space-like, manifold at each fixed t has a vanishing Ricci\ntensor. These are simply the equations of four dimensional euclidean gravity, where we can think\nof x5 as representing euclidean, periodic time. Our task is greatly simplified by the fact that\nthe equations of four-dimensional euclidean gravity have been extensively studied. For example,\nthe Kaluza-Klein monopole of Gross and Perry, and of Sorkin [2], which is the object of our\nconsiderations here, is obtained by imbedding the Taub-NUT gravitational instanton into five\ndimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. Its line element is expressed as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011 (d\u03c8 + 4m cos \u03b8 d\u03c6)2\n4m \u0010 2\n2\n2\nds = \u2212dt + 1 +\ndr + r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ) +\n,\n(2.2)\n4m\nr\n1+\nr\nwhere r > 0, and the angles \u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c8, (0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0, 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0) parametrize S3 \u2248 SU (2). The\napparent singularity at the origin is unphysical [4] if \u03c8 is periodic with period 16\u03c0m. Since we\nwant our solution to approach the vacuum for large r, we must identify 16\u03c0m with 2\u03c0R. Thus\n\u221a\nR\n\u03c0G\nm=\n=\n.\n(2.3)\n8\n2e\n~ =\u2207\n~ \u00d7A\n~ = 4m ~r/r3 ,\nThe gauge field, A\u03bc , is clearly that of a monopole, A\u03c6 = 4m cos \u03b8, B\nand has a string singularity along the whole z axis. As usual, this singularity is an artifact if\nand only in the period of x5 is equal to 16\u03c0m. The magnetic charge of our monopole is thus\nfixed by the radius of the Kaluza-Klein circle.

We argue that they\nsatisfy the relations\n\u0012\n\u0013E\n\u0012\n\u0013E\nin\nin\n\u02c6 ~\n~\n~\n~k\u02c6 := ~k/|~k|,\n~\n(J * k) k\n= \u2213s k\n,\n(6.3)\nout\n\n\u02c6 ~\n~ * ~k)\n(K\nk\n\n\u0012\n\nin\nout\n\nout\n\n\u0013E\n\n= (ik \u00b1 4m(E \u2212 q 2 ) ~k\n\n\u0012\n\nin\nout\n\n\u0013E\n.\n\n(6.4)\n\nThe states |~k(in) > and |~k(out) > are solutions of the complete time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation controlled at t = \u2213\u221e. It is enough to check the validity of eqn. (6.3) and (6.4) at\n\u02c6\n~ * ~k\u02c6 which are therefore constants of\nt = \u2213\u221e, since H commutes with the operators J~ * ~k and K\nthe motion. Let us apply the left and right hand sides of the operator identity J~ * ~rr = 4mq to\nthe states |~k(in) > and |~k(out) > and take into account that |~k(in) > and |~k(out) > approach\n\u02c6\neigenstates of ~rr with eigenvalues \u2213~k as t \u2192 \u2213\u221e, since |~k(in) > and |~k(out) > represent wave\u02c6\npackets incoming from (outgoing to) the direction ~k when t \u2192 \u2213\u221e. This yields (6.3).\nTo make (6.4) plausible, apply rather the operator identity\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011\n4m \u0010 ~\u02c6 ~\n~r \u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n~\n~\nK *k = 1+\ni~v * k \u2212 J * (~v \u00d7 ~k) \u2212 4m * ~k(H \u2212 q 2 )\n(6.5)\nr\nr\nto |~k(in) > and |~k(out) > and notice that, besides approaching eigenstates of ~r/r, they also\napproach velocity eigenstates with eigenvalue ~k as t \u2192 \u2213\u221e. Similarly, the position dependent\nmass M = 1 + 4m/r tends to unity since the incoming and outgoing wave packets are far\naway from the monopole's location. The equations (6.3) and (6.4) can also be tested on the\nexplicit solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, obtained by Gibbons and Manton [6] in parabolic\ncoordinates.\nHaving established (6.3) and (6.4) let us now take into account that, for fixed charge and\nenergy, the scattering states span a representation of the dynamical o(3, 1) algebra. This representation is characterized by the eigenvalues of the Casimir operators, fixed by the constraints\n(5.6)-(5.7). Among those states with fixed energy and charge we have, in addition to those bases\nwhich consist of (distorted) plane-wave-like scattering states |~k(in) > and |~k(out) >, also the\nstandard angular momentum basis (spherical waves) |j, j3 > , (j = |s|, |s| + 1, . . . ),\nJ~ 2 |j, j3 >= j(j + 1)|j, j3 > ,\n\nJ3 |j, j3 >= j3 |j, j3 > .\n\n(6.6)\n\nThe angular momentum basis is easy to handle. We would obtain the matrix elements\n< ~l(out)|~k(in) > if we could expand |~k(in) > and |~k(out) > in the angular momentum basis. The\ndesired expansions can be algebraically derived, since one has the o(3, 1) algebra and all the\nbasis vectors |~k(in) > , |~k(out) > , and |j, j3 > are eigenvectors of the appropriate components of\n11\n\n\fthe generators. The details are practically identical to those presented by Zwanziger [10]. This\nleads to the final expression\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(j \u2212 i\u03bb)!\nj\n~\n~\n~\n~\n(2j + 1)\nS l, k = l(out)|k(in) =\nD(\u2212s,s)\nR~\u22121 R~k ,\n(6.7)\nl\n(j + i\u03bb)!\nj\u2265|s|\n\nwith \u03bb given in (4.11). The D's are the rotation matrices and R~k is a rotation which brings the\nz direction into the direction of ~k. Eq. (6.7) is consistent with Eq. (4.14) for the cross-section,\nand its poles yield the bound-state spectrum (4.13).\nIt should be emphasized that the derivation of the S-matrix given here above crucially de~ in terms of the 3 dimensional variables\npends on the expression (6.1) of the Runge-Lenz vector K\nand on the constraint equations (5.6)-(5.7), which fix the actual representation of o(3, 1). These\nrelations are in turn straightforward consequences of Carter's covariant expressions.\n\n7\n\nEXTENSION INTO o(4, 2)\n\nNow we extend [12, 13] the o(4) symmetry into the conformal algebra o(4, 2). Let us re-arrange\nthe time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation as\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n2\n(1 + 4m/r)\u22121 p~ + 1 + 4m/r q 2 \u2212 2E \u03a8 = 0.\n(7.1)\nWhen multiplied by r(1 + 4m/r) = r + 4m from the left, the operator on the l.h.s. becomes,\nafter rearrangement,\n\u0001 (4mq)2\n2\nr p~ + r q 2 \u2212 2E +\n= 8m(E \u2212 q 2 ).\n(7.2)\nr\nLet us work first with bound motions, q 2 /2 > E, and introduce the variables\n~ = ~r (q 2 \u2212 2E)1/2\nR\n\nand\n\nP~ = p~ (q 2 \u2212 2E)\u22121/2 .\n\n(7.3)\n\n~ and P~ satisfy the commutation relations\nThe new operators R\n[Pj , Pk ] = \u2212i(4mq)\u000fjkn\n\nRn\n,\nR3\n\n[Rj , Pk ] = i\u03b4 jk .\n\n[Rj , Rk ] = 0,\n\n(7.4)\n\n~ and P~ , eqn. (7.1) becomes\nIn terms of R\nR(P~ 2 + 1) +\n\n(4qm)2\nE \u2212 q2\n= \u22128m p\n.\nR\nq 2 \u2212 2E\n\n(7.5)\n\nOn the left hand side of (7.5) we recognize \u03930 , the generator of an o(2, 1) algebra. Indeed, as a\nconsequence of the commutation relations (7.5), the operators\n\u03930 =\n\n1 ~2\n(4qm)2 \u0001\nRP + R +\n,\n2\nR\n\n(7.6)\n\n\u03934 =\n\n1 ~2\n(4qm)2 \u0001\nRP \u2212 R +\n,\n2\nR\n\n(7.7)\n\n~ * P~ \u2212 i\nD = R\n\n(7.8)\n\nsatisfy the o(2, 1) relations\n[\u03930 , \u03934 ] = iD,\n\n[\u03934 , D] = \u2212i\u03930 ,\n12\n\n[D, \u03930 ] = i\u03934 .\n\n\fThe energy spectrum (but not the degeneracy) is recovered from this at once: the o(2, 1) generator \u03930 has eigenvalues n = |s| + 1, |s| + 2, . . . Equating the r.h.s. of eqn. (7.5) with 2n, we\nget once more the crucial relation (4.12). Let us complete (7.6)-(7.8) with 12 more operators,\nnamely with\n~\nV\n\n= RP~\n\n(7.9)\n\n~\n~ \u00d7 P~ + 4qm R ,\nJ~ = R\nR\n\n(7.10)\n\n~\nM\n\n=\n\n~\n~\nR\nJ~\nR\n1~ ~ 2 ~ ~ ~\nR(P ) \u2212 P (R * P ) \u2212 \u2212 4qm + (4qm)2 2 ,\n2\n2\nR\n2R\n\n(7.11)\n\n~\nU\n\n=\n\n~\n~\n1~ ~ 2 ~ ~ ~\nR\nR\nJ~\nR(P ) \u2212 P (R * P ) + \u2212 4qm + (4qm)2 2 .\n2\n2\nR\n2R\n\n(7.12)\n\nThe commutation relations (7.4) imply that these operators extend the o(2, 1) algebra (7.6)(7.8) into an o(4, 2) conformal algebra. Those operators commuting with \u03930 form an o(2) \u2295 o(4),\n~ . Expressed in terms of ~r and p~, we see that J~ is just the\ngenerated by \u03930 itself and by J~ and M\n~ is also written as\nangular momentum operator. On the other hand, M\n\u0001 ~\n~ = 1 P~ \u00d7 J~ \u2212 J~ \u00d7 P~ + R \u03930 .\nM\n2\nR\n\n(7.13)\n\nUsing the relation (7.5) this becomes\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n~\n~ = 1 P~ \u00d7 J~ \u2212 J~ \u00d7 P~ \u2212 4m R pE \u2212 q\nM\n.\n2\nR q 2 \u2212 2E\n\n(7.14)\n\n~ reduces to (the restriction onto H\u03a8 = E\u03a8 states) of the rescaled\nSubstituting here ~r and p~, M\nRunge-Lenz vector in (5.2), as anticipated by our notation. We conclude that the o(4, 2) algebra\n(7.6)-(7.12) extends the original dynamical o(4) symmetry.\nThe scattering case E > q 2 /2 is treated exactly the same way. Defining\np\n~ = ~r 2E \u2212 q 2 ,\nR\n(7.15)\none discovers, after suitable rearrangement, the non-compact operator \u03934 with continuous spectrum. The extension to o(4, 2) proceeds along the same lines as before. Those operators com~ and U\n~ , this latter being now identified\nmuting with \u03934 form o(2) \u2295 o(3, 1), generated by \u03934 , J,\n~\nwith the rescaled Runge-Lenz vector M . Note that a similar procedure works for a particle in\na self-dual monopole field [14].\nNote added in 2009.
