For instance, the\nQW is an important primitive in universal quantum\ncomputation [4, 5] and efficient quantum algorithms [6\u2013\n10]. The realization of topological phases [11] and quantum phase transitions [12] in optical lattice systems by\nthe QW have been discussed. The relation between\nthe Landau-Zener transition and the QW was found in\nRef. [13]. The QW provides a new clue to more fundamental problems such as the quantum foundations of\ntime [14] and the photosynthesis and efficient energy\ntransfer in biomolecules [15, 16]. There are several important properties of the QW: (i) the inverted-bell like\nlimit distribution, (ii) the quadratic speed-up of the variance to the classical RW, and (iii) the localization due to\nthe quantum coherence and interference. The physical,\nmathematical, and computational properties of the QW\nare summarized in Refs. [17\u201320].\nIn this paper, we focus on the localization property of\nthe QW and study a class of the discrete-time quantum\nwalk (DTQW) on a one-dimensional lattice with spatially\ninhomogeneous coins. Throughout this paper, we define\nthe localization such that the limit distribution of the\nDTQW divided by some power of the time variable has\nthe probability density given by the Dirac delta function.\nThe localization in the DTQW with homogeneous coins\nhas so far been extensively studied. In the one dimensional DTQW, the localization was shown in the models\nwith a three-dimensional coin [21], a four-dimensional\ncoin [22], a two-dimensional coin with memory [23], a\ntwo-dimensional coin in a random environment [24] and\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: shikano@mit.edu\naddress: katsura@kitp.ucsb.edu\n\na time-dependent two-dimensional coin; the Fibonacci\nQW [28]. On the other hand, the nature of the localization in the two-dimensional DTQW has been studied numerically [29, 30] and analytically [31, 32]. The\nDTQW on the Cayley tree with a multi-state coin was\nalso studied [33]. Furthermore, the recurrence properties\nof the DTQW, i.e., the decay rate of the probability at the\norigin, were studied in Refs. [34\u201338]. Recently, the localization property of the DTQW with the inhomogeneous\ntwo-dimensional coin has been analytically shown in the\nmodel in which the coin at the origin is different from the\nrest [39, 40] and in the model of the periodically inhomogeneous coins [41]. In this paper, we generalize the model\ninvestigated in Ref. [41] to the incommensurate case and\nshow the localization property of the generalized model.\nThe generalized model defined in the next section is\ninspired by the Aubry-Andr\u00e9 model [42], which describes\nthe one-dimensional tight-binding model with an incommensurate potential. The corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation is called the almost Mathieu equation [43]:\n\u03c8(n + 1) + \u03c8(n \u2212 1) + V cos(2\u03c0\u03b1n)\u03c8(n) = E\u03c8(n), (1)\nwhere \u03c8(n) is the amplitude of the wavefunction at the\nnth site, \u03b1 is the irrational number, and E is the eigenenergy. The model is often used to study the localizationdelocalization transition [44]. Aubry and Andr\u00e9 have\nshown that all the eigenstates are localized when V > 2\nwhile they are extended when V < 2. The model was\nshown to be self-dual with respect to the Fourier transform at V = 2 [42]. The critical point V = 2 is closely\nrelated to the Azbel-Hofstadter problem, which is the\neigenvalue problem of the Bloch electron on a square lattice in a uniform magnetic field [45, 46]. The energy spectrum shows a self-similar and fractal structure known as\nthe Hofstadter butterfly [46]. The multifractal property\nof the spectrum and wavefunctions have been studied in\nRefs. [47, 48] and its Bethe ansatz solution was discussed\nin Refs. [49\u201351]. In this paper, we show that our QW\nmodel is self-dual under the Aubry-Andr\u00e9 duality trans-\n\n\f2\nformation. We also study the eigenvalues of the one-step\ntime evolution of our QW and find that the spectrum\nshows a self-similar and fractal structure in analogy to\nthe Hofstadter butterfly.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we define\nthe DTQW with spatially inhomogeneous coins and show\nthat this model is self-dual under a certain transformation, which is analogous to the Aubry-Andr\u00e9 duality. In\nSec. III, we rigorously show that the limit distribution of\nour DTQW model is localized at the origin, which means\nthat the distribution has the finite support for any time.\nIn Sec. IV, we numerically study the eigenvalues of the\nunitary operator for the one-step time evolution in our\nmodel and show the spectrum as a function of the inverse\nperiod (the Hofstadter butterfly diagram). Section V is\ndevoted to the summary and discussion.\nII.\n\nMore explicitly, the operator C is written in the following\nform\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\nX\u0014\ncos(2\u03c0\u03b1n) \u2212 sin(2\u03c0\u03b1n)\n|nihn| \u2297\nC=\nsin(2\u03c0\u03b1n) cos(2\u03c0\u03b1n)\nn\ni\nXh\n(6)\n:=\n|nihn| \u2297 \u0108n ,\nn\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a real number (\u03b1 \u2208 R) and corresponds to the\ninverse period of the coin operations. This inverse period\ncan even be incommensurate to the underlying lattice. It\nreminds us of the Aubry-Andr\u00e9 model [42]. We call this\nmodel the inhomogeneous QW throughout this paper.\nNote that, this model is a generalization of that in Ref.\n[41]. As an example, in Fig. 1 we show the behavior of\nthe probability distribution at the 1000th step obtained\nby numerical iteration.\n\nINHOMOGENEOUS QUANTUM WALK\nAND AUBRY-ANDR\u00c9 DUALITY\n\nLet us define the one-dimensional DTQW [52] as follows. First, we prepare the position and coin states denoted as |ni \u2297 |\u03b6i = |n, \u03b6i. Here, the position n is along\nthe infinite one-dimensional lattice Z (the integers) and\n|\u03b6i is a normalized linear combination of |Li = (1, 0)T\nand |Ri = (0, 1)T , where T is the transposition. Second, we describe the time evolution of the DTQW using\nthe unitary operator U defined by two kinds of unitary\noperations \u0108 and W . The quantum coin flip \u0108 \u2208 U (2)\ncorresponds to the coin flip at each site in the RW. By\nthe shift operator W , the position n changes depending\non the coin state:\nW |n, Li := |n \u2212 1, Li,\nW |n, Ri := |n + 1, Ri.\nWe can explicitly write the shift operator as\nX\nW =\n(|n \u2212 1, Lihn, L| + |n + 1, Rihn, R|) .\n\n(2)\n\nFIG. 1: Probability distribution in the inhomogeneous QW\nafter the 1000\n\u221a time steps. Here, we take the initial coin state\n(|Li + |Ri)/ 2 and the inverse period \u03b1 = \u03c0/2, which is an\nirrational number. Note that, the probability outside the plot\nrange is zero within the numerical accuracy.\n\n(3)\n\nn\n\nThen, the one-step time evolution for the DTQW is expressed as U = W (Id. \u2297 \u0108), where Id. expresses the\nidentity operator. Starting from the initial state |0, \u03c6i,\nwe apply U to the state at every step. After the t time\nsteps, we obtain the probability distribution at the position n as\nX\n2\nhn, \u03be|U t |0, \u03c6i .\n(4)\nPr(n; t) =\n\u03be\u2208{L,R}\n\nIn the following, we introduce the DTQW with the\nspatially inhomogeneous coins. In this class of models,\nthe quantum coin flip at each site can be different from\nthe others. The coin operator C acting on the position\nand coin states is then given by\nX\nC=\n[(cos(2\u03c0\u03b1n)|n, Li + sin(2\u03c0\u03b1n)|n, Ri)hn, L|\nn\n\n+(cos(2\u03c0\u03b1n)|n, Ri \u2212 sin(2\u03c0\u03b1n)|n, Li)hn, R|] . (5)\n\nWe shall now show that the inhomogeneous QW is\nalways self-dual under a certain duality transformation.\nLet us introduce a duality transformation, which corresponds to the spatial Fourier transform [53],\nX\n|n, L\u0303i =\n[sin(2\u03c0\u03b1mn)|m, Li + cos(2\u03c0\u03b1mn)|m, Ri] ,\nm\n\n|n, R\u0303i =\n\nX\n\n[cos(2\u03c0\u03b1mn)|m, Li + sin(2\u03c0\u03b1mn)|m, Ri] .(7)\n\nm\n\nIt should be noted that these states are not normalized.\nLet us now see the action of the shift operator W on\nthese states. One can easily check the following relations\nW |n, L\u0303i = cos(2\u03c0\u03b1n)|n, L\u0303i + sin(2\u03c0\u03b1n)|n, R\u0303i,\nW |n, R\u0303i = cos(2\u03c0\u03b1n)|n, R\u0303i \u2212 sin(2\u03c0\u03b1n)|n, L\u0303i.\n\n(8)\n\nIt is now obvious that the shift operator W acts like a\ncoin operator in the dual basis. Similarly, the action of\n\n\f3\nthe operator C in the dual basis is given by\nC|n, L\u0303i = |n \u2212 1, L\u0303i,\nC|n, R\u0303i = |n + 1, R\u0303i,\n\n(9)\n\nand it can be regarded as the shift operator in the dual\nbasis. In this way, the duality transformation completely\ninterchange the roles of W and C. Therefore, the inhomogeneous QW is self-dual under the transformation\n(7).\nIII.\n\nThe above equations mean that the quantum walker is\nreflected at the position n = \u00b1mQ and cannot be transmitted across this point (see Fig. 2). Since the initial\nposition is localized at the origin (n = 0), the quantum\nwalker undergoes reflection only at the sites \u00b1Q. Therefore, we conclude that the distribution of the inhomogeneous QW has the finite support [\u2212Q, Q] for any time t.\n\nLIMIT LOCALIZED DISTRIBUTION\n\nIn this section, we analytically show the localization in\nthe inhomogeneous QW as the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. For any irrational \u03b1 \u2208 R \\ Q, the limit distribution of the inhomogeneous QW divided by any power\nof the time variable is localized at the origin:\nXt\n\u21d2I\n(t \u2192 \u221e),\n(10)\nt\u03b8\nwhere Xt is the random variable for the position at the t\nstep [54, Ch. 2], \u03b8 (> 0) is an arbitrary parameter, and\n\"\u21d2\" means convergence in distribution [55]. Here, the\nlimit distribution I has the probability density function\nf (x) = \u03b4(x) (x \u2208 R), where \u03b4(*) is the Dirac delta function. Note that, the limit distribution I is independent of\nthe parameter \u03b8.\nThis theorem is the main result of this paper and\nmeans that the distribution of the inhomogeneous QW\nhas a finite support for almost all \u03b1. We first show the\nfollowing lemma to prove the above theorem in the case\nof specific rational \u03b1.\nP\n\u2208 Q with relatively prime P\nLemma 1. When \u03b1 = 4Q\n(odd integer) and Q, the inhomogeneous QW is restricted\nto the finite interval [\u2212Q, Q].\n\nProof.

(3, 5). We show the\ngeneral properties of the eigenvalues as well as the numerically obtained distribution of them, which suggests\nthe self-similar and fractal structure in the spectrum in\nanalogy to the Hofstadter butterfly problem.\nWe first show the following theorem for the eigenvalues\nof the operators W C and CW .\nTheorem 3. All the eigenvalues of the operators W C\nand CW are identical including the degeneracy.\nProof. Let |\u03bci be an eigenvector of the operator W C with\na nonzero eigenvalue \u03bc:\nW C|\u03bci = \u03bc|\u03bci.\n\nIn the following, we prove Theorem 1.\n\n\u03b1=\n\nIV.\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u22121/(4Q2) < \u03b4 < 1/(4Q2) according to Corollary 1.\nWe calculate the diagonal elements of the coin operator\nat the \u00b1Qth site as\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nP\ncos 2\u03c0\n+ \u03b4 (\u00b1Q) = (\u22121)(P +1)/2 sin(2\u03c0Q\u03b4).\n4Q\n(19)\nNote that both the diagonal elements of \u0108\u00b1Q are equal.\nWe obtain\n\u03c0\n< \u01eb.\n(20)\n(\u22121)(P +1)/2 sin(2\u03c0Q\u03b4) <\n2Q\nSince \u01eb can be arbitrarily small, the diagonal element is\nzero in the limit. Then, along the same lines as Lemma 1,\nthe inhomogeneous QW is restricted to the finite interval\n[\u2212Q, Q]. Since the time variable t and the parameter \u01eb\nare independent, the time variable t and the parameter\nQ are also independent. Therefore, we obtain the desired\nresult (10).\n\n(21)\n\nNote that, all the eigenvalues of W C are nonzero and\nhave modulus 1 since W C is a unitary operator. Multiplying C from the left, one obtains\nCW (C|\u03bci) = \u03bc(C|\u03bci).\n\n(22)\n\nSince C is also a unitary operator, C|\u03bci is a nonzero\neigenvector of CW with the eigenvalue \u03bc. To complete\nthe proof, we need to repeat the same argument for CW .\nLet |\u03bbi be an eigenvector of CW with an eigenvalue \u03bb:\nCW |\u03bbi = \u03bb|\u03bbi.\n\n(23)\n\nMultiplying W from the left, one obtains\nW C(W |\u03bbi) = \u03bb(W |\u03bbi).\n\n(24)\n\nSince W is a unitary operator, W |\u03bbi is a nonzero eigenvector of W C with the eigenvalue \u03bb. The identical degeneracy of W C and CW follows from the fact that the\nunitary operator C or W preserves the orthogonality of\nthe states with the same eigenvalue.\nRemark 2. Theorem 3 holds not only for the inhomogeneous QW but also for the standard DTQW, in which\nthe coin operator does not depend on the positions.\n\nRemark 1. If the diagonal elements of the coin operator\nat a position on each side the origin are zero, then the\nDTQW is finitely restricted, i.e., the localization at the\norigin as in Eq. (10).\n\nAccording to Theorem 3, we have only to study the\neigenvalues of CW . In the following, we focus on the case\nP\nof the rational number \u03b1 = 4Q\n\u2208 Q. In this case, from\nLemma 1, we can express CW as a 4Q \u00d7 4Q irreducible\nmatrix. Let us first derive a finite-dimensional matrix\nrepresentation of CW . We can express the wavefunction\nat the t step evolving from the state |0, \u03c6\u0303i by CW :\nX\n\u03c6t (n, \u03be)|n, \u03bei.\n(25)\n(CW )t |0, \u03c6\u0303i =\n\nTherefore, the limit distribution of the DTQW with a\nrandomly chosen quantum coin \u0108n,random with uniform\ndistribution in U (2) at each position n (\u2208 Z) divided by\nany power of the time variable is also localized. This is\nbecause the diagonal elements of \u0108n,random must be zero\nat some positions. This result is relevant to Ref. [24].\n\nAlong the same lines as the proof of Lemma 1, one\nobtains the one-step time evolution of the coefficients\n\u03c6t (n, \u03be) as follows:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c6t (n + 1; L)\n\u03c6t+1 (n; L)\n,\n(26)\n= \u0108n\n\u03c6t (n \u2212 1; R)\n\u03c6t+1 (n; R)\n\nAnalogous to the above discussion, we show the localization property of the DTQW with spatially random\ncoins as follows. From Lemma 1, we obtain the following\nremark, which was implicitly shown in Ref. [41].\n\nn\u2208Z\n\u03be\u2208{L,R}\n\n\f5\nwhere \u0108n is defined in Eq. (6).\nSince the initial condition is |0, \u03c6\u0303i, one can clearly see\nthat \u03c6t (\u2212Q; L) = \u03c6t (Q; R) = 0 for any time t and hence\nthe inhomogeneous QW by CW is also restricted to the\nfinite interval [\u2212Q, Q] like Lemma 1. It is convenient to\nintroduce the vector \u03c6\n~ t defined by the coefficients \u03c6t (n; \u03be)\nas\n\u03c6\n~ t = (\u03c6t (\u2212Q; R), \u03c6t (\u2212Q + 1; L), \u03c6t (\u2212Q + 1; R),\n..., \u03c6t (Q \u2212 1; L), \u03c6t (Q \u2212 1; R), \u03c6t (Q; L))T . (27)\nNote that, \u03c6\n~ t is the 4Q-dimensional vector. Using \u03c6\n~ t , we\ncan simply express Eq. (26) as\n\u03c6\n~ t+1 = CW~\n\u03c6t .\n\n(28)\n\nHere, C and W are 4Q \u00d7 4Q matrices and their explicit\nforms are given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nP +1\n(\u22121) 2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u0108\u2212Q+1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u0108\u2212Q+2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7(29)\nC = \uf8ec\n..\n\uf8f7\n.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\u0108Q\u22121\nP +1\n(\u22121) 2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nT\n0 \u00ea1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u00ea2 \u00d4 \u00ea1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u00d4\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n1\n2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(30)\nW = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n.\n.\n.\n.. .. ..\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\u00ea2 \u00d4 \u00ea1 \uf8f8\n\u00eaT\n0\n2\n\nFIG. 3: The self-similar and fractal structure in the inhomogeneous QW. Arguments of the eigenvalues of CW (vertical\nP\naxis) are plotted as a function of the parameter \u03b1 = 4Q\n(horizontal axis) with Q \u2264 50.

This property\ncan be shown as follows. Suppose that \u03c6\n~ is the eigenvector of CW at the inverse period \u03b1 with the eigenvalue \u03bb.\nThen, according to Eq. (26), one obtains\n\nwhere\n\u00d4 =\n\nP +1\n\n\u0012\n\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\u0013\n\n, \u00ea1 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n, \u00ea2 =\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n1\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\nWe note that empty entries in the matrices are zeros. One\ncan easily confirm that C and W are unitary matrices.\nWe shall now study the eigenvalues of CW. Since the\nmatrix CW is unitary, the eigenvalues \u03bb(\u2208 C) have modulus 1, i.e., |\u03bb| = 1. Therefore, the argument of \u03bb faithfully\nrepresents the eigenvalues. Figure 3 shows the spectrum\nas a function of the inverse period \u03b1, obtained by exact diagonalization of CW. Although we can only study\nP\nthe case of rational \u03b1 = 4Q\n\u2208 Q by numerical diagonalization, we can understand the spectrum of CW with\n\u03b1 \u2208 R \\ Q as the irrational limit of a well-organized sequence of rational numbers, whose existence is guaranteed by Theorem 2. From Fig. 3, one can clearly see\nthe self-similar and fractal nature in the eigenvalue distribution. We also notice the following properties of the\nspectrum:\n(P1) All the eigenvalues at \u03b1 are identical to those at\n1 \u2212 \u03b1.\n(P2) The eigenvalues come in complex conjugate pairs:\nfor every eigenvalue \u03bb, there is an eigenvalue \u03bb\u2217 .\n\n\u03bb\u03c6(\u2212Q; R) = (\u22121) 2 \u03c6(\u2212Q + 1; L),\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03c6(n + 1; L)\n\u03c6(n; L)\n, (n \u2208 (\u2212Q, Q))\n= \u0108n (\u03b1)\n\u03bb\n\u03c6(n \u2212 1; R)\n\u03c6(n; R)\n\u03bb\u03c6(Q; L) = (\u22121)\n\nP +1\n2\n\n\u03c6(Q \u2212 1; R),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u0108n is denoted as \u0108n (\u03b1) to emphasize the argument\n\u03b1. We now consider the following transformation:\n\u03c6(n; L) \u2192 \u03c6(\u2212n; R),\n\n\u03c6(n; R) \u2192 \u03c6(\u2212n; L).\n\n(33)\n\nUnder this transformation, Eq. (32) becomes\nP +1\n\n\u03bb\u03c6(\u2212Q; R) = (\u22121) 2 \u03c6(\u2212Q + 1; L),\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03c6(n + 1; L)\n\u03c6(n; L)\n, (n \u2208 (\u2212Q, Q))\n= \u0108n (\u2212\u03b1)\n\u03bb\n\u03c6(n \u2212 1; R)\n\u03c6(n; R)\n\u03bb\u03c6(Q; L) = (\u22121)\n\nP +1\n2\n\n\u03c6(Q \u2212 1; R).\n\n(34)\n\nThe above equations are equivalent to CW~\n\u03c6 = \u03bb~\n\u03c6 at the\ninverse period 1 \u2212 \u03b1. Therefore, the sets of eigenvalues at\n\u03b1 and 1\u2212\u03b1 are identical. Furthermore, one can construct\nthe eigenvectors of CW at 1 \u2212 \u03b1 from those at \u03b1 using the\ntransformation (33). (P2) implies that the spectrum is\nsymmetrical with respect to the line arg(\u03bb) = 0 in Fig. 3.\n\n\f6\nOn can easily show (P2) by taking the complex conjugate\nof Eq. (32) and see that \u03c6\n~ \u2217 is the eigenvector of CW with\n\u2217\nthe eigenvalue \u03bb . (P3) combined with (P2) gives rise to\nthe symmetry with respect to the line arg(\u03bb) = \u03c0/2 or\narg(\u03bb) = \u2212\u03c0/2 in Fig. 3. (P3) is reminiscent of the chiral or particle-hole symmetry in the original Hofstadter\nproblem, i.e., the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian come\nin pairs \u00b1E. This property holds not only for our inhomogeneous QW but also for rather generic classes of the\nDTQW. To show (P3), we consider the local gauge transformation: \u03c6(n; \u03be) \u2192 (\u22121)n \u03c6(n; \u03be). Under this transformation, \u03c6\n~ becomes the eigenvector of CW with the\neigenvalue \u2212\u03bb according to Eq. (32). This proves (P3).\nProperties (P4) and (P5) requires a more elaborate\nanalysis. To show (P4), we first show that \u03c6(\u2212Q; R) 6= 0\nif \u03c6\n~ is an eigenvector of CW. Suppose for the sake of\ncontradiction that \u03c6(\u2212Q; R) = 0. Using Eq. (32), it\nfollows that \u03c6\n~ = ~0. But this contradicts the fact that \u03c6\n~\nis the eigenvector of CW. Therefore, \u03c6(\u2212Q; R) 6= 0. It\nP\nshould be noted that 2\u03c0n 4Q\n6= \u03c0l/2 (l \u2208 Z) for \u2212Q <\nn < Q. We next suppose that CW has two eigenvectors\n\u03c6\n~ (1) and \u03c6\n~ (2) with the same eigenvalue \u03bb. Then, we define\nthe linear combination of them as\n\u03c6\n~ \u2032 = \u03c6(2) (\u2212Q; R)~\n\u03c6(1) \u2212 \u03c6(1) (\u2212Q; R)~\n\u03c6(2)\n\n(35)\n\nand find \u03c6\n~ \u2032 (\u2212Q; R) = 0. The vector \u03c6\n~ \u2032 is also an eigenvector of CW and this contradicts the previous statement.\nTherefore, all the eigenvalues of CW are simple. Let us\nfinally show the last property (P5). We first note that\nthe product of the eigenvalues \u03bbk (k = 1, ..., 4Q) is\n4Q\nY\n\n\u03bbk = \u22121\n\n(36)\n\nk=1\n\nsince det CW = det(C) det(W) = \u22121. Here, we have used\nthe fact that det C = 1 and det W = \u22121. This can be\nshown by an explicit calculation using Eqs. (29) and\n(30). Next, from (P2) and (P3), we see the eigenvalues\n\u03bbk come in quadruplets \u03bbk , \u03bb\u2217k , \u2212\u03bbk , \u2212\u03bb\u2217k if \u03bbk is neither\n\u00b11 nor \u00b1i. Since |\u03bbk |2 = 1 and Eq. (36), there exists k\nsuch that \u03bbk = \u22121. The multiplicity of \u03bbk = \u22121 should\nbe 1 due to (P4). Then, noting the fact that the number\nof eigenvalues 4Q is a multiple of 4, we can conclude that\n\u03bbk = \u00b1i should also be included as the eigenvalues of\nCW. This proves the statement (P5). Note that, the\nproperties of the chiral symmetry (P3) and the existence\nof eigenvalues \u03bb = \u00b11 are relevant to Ref. [11] discussed\nin the standard DTQW.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION AND OUTLOOKS\n\nWe have introduced the class of the inhomogeneous\nQW with self-duality inspired by the Aubry-Andr\u00e9\nmodel [42]. Our main result is Theorem 1. We have\n\nanalytically shown that the limit distribution of the inhomogeneous QW divided by any power of time is localized at the origin when the inverse period of coins \u03b1\nis irrational number. We emphasize that our analytical\nsolution for the localization is powerful since the roundoff error is inevitable in numerical simulations. We have\nalso numerically studied the eigenvalue distributions of\nthe quantum walk operator W C in the inhomogeneous\nP\n\u2208 Q. The obtained spectrum shows\nQW with \u03b1 = 4Q\nthe self-similar and fractal structure similar to the Hofstadter butterfly.\nIn our model, the following problems remain open:\nFirst, it might be possible to experimentally realize the\ninhomogeneous QW in quantum optics as pointed out in\nRef. [57]. Second, the recurrence property of the inhomogeneous QW has not been analytically obtained. The\nexample of the recurrence is numerically shown in Fig. 4.\nFinally, we have not yet obtained the limit distribution\nP\nin the case of the rational \u03b1 \u2208 Q except for \u03b1 = 4Q\nwith relative prime P (odd integer) and Q. According to\nRef. [58], the limit distribution of the DTQW is partly\nrelated to the eigenvalues of the quantum walk operator W C. From Fig. 3, the eigenvalues in the considering\ncase seem to be continuous. Therefore, we propose the\nfollowing conjecture as a general property of the DTQW.\nConjecture 1. The distribution of the DTQW is not\nlocalized if the quantum walk operator W C only has continuous spectra and does not have embedded eigenvalues.\nThis conjecture is motivated by Ref. [59] to show the\nproperty of the bound states from the spectrum of the\ndiscrete Schr\u00f6dinger operator, which includes the almost\nMathieu equation (1). Let us examine this conjecture for\nsome cases in our inhomogeneous QW. It is easy to check\nthat, in the case of \u03b1 = P/2 (P \u2208 Z), W C has a continuous spectrum and localization does not occur. In this\ncase, the coin state is unchanged\u0012 up to\u0013the \u0012\nphase factor\n\u0013\n\u22121 0\n1 0\n.\nor\nsince the coin operator is always\n0 \u22121\n0 1\nTherefore, the quantum walker does not undergo reflection at any point. Furthermore, in the case of \u03b1 = 1/6,\nLinden and Sharam showed that the standard deviation\nis proportional to the time variable t for a sufficient large\nt [41]. These facts partially support the above conjecture.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nOne of the authors (Y.S.) acknowledges Takuya\nMachida, Norio Konno, Etsuo Segawa, and Seth Lloyd\nfor encouraging discussion.
