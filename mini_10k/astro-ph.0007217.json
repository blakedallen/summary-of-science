INTRODUCTION\n\nObservations indicate that most of the baryonic matter\nin the universe does not reside in galaxies. At high redshifts (z >\n\u223c 2), the overwhelming majority of baryons are\nin a diffuse, photoionized intergalactic medium (IGM), observable as H I absorption lines in the spectra of distant\nquasars (Cen et al. 1994; Zhang, Anninos, & Norman 1995;\nMiralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. 1996; Hernquist et al. 1996). The\nbaryonic density inferred from these observations (Rauch\net al. 1997) is in good agreement with nucleosynthesis arguments based on observed deuterium abundances (Tytler,\nFan, & Burles 1996). But by redshift zero the total baryonic component, inferred from H I absorption, gas and\nstars in galaxies, and other observations, has declined to a\nlevel small compared to that seen at high redshift and expectations from nucleosynthesis (Fukugita, Hogan & Peebles 1998; Hogan 1999). Thus the question arises, where\nare the baryons at the present epoch?\nBy the current epoch, hierarchical structure formation has produced deep potential wells into which the\nbaryons accrete, thereby moving a significant portion of\nthe baryons from the IGM into stars, galaxies, groups, and\nclusters. These complex evolutionary processes may now\nbe modeled directly using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, enabling an investigation into the location and\nphase of baryonic constituents in the present-day universe,\nand suggesting possible avenues for their direct detection.\nThese hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation\nindicate that baryons in the universe reside in four broad\nphases, defined by their overdensity \u03b4 \u2261 \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 \u2212 1 (where \u03c1\u0304\n\n1.

The \"Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium\" (WHIM), discussed here.\n.\nCen & Ostriker (1999; hereafter CO99) and Dav\u00e9 et al.\n(1999; hereafter DHKW) predicted that a sizeable fraction of all baryons at the present epoch reside in this last\nwarm-hot phase (see Figure 2 of CO99 and Figure 12 of\nDHKW). Such a reservoir has significant implications for\nproducing an accurate census of baryons for comparison\nwith nucleosynthesis arguments (e.g. Fukugita, Hogan &\nPeebles 1998) because gas at these temperatures and densities is difficult to detect in either absorption or emission,\nas we will discuss in \u00a76.\nIn this paper we study the nature and evolution of\nwarm-hot gas in a \u039bCDM universe, using a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations having a wide range\nof numerical and physical parameters.

The evolution of diffuse gas at high redshift into condensed, hot,\nand WHIM gas at the present epoch is quantified in \u00a73.\nOur primary result, presented in \u00a74, is that the WHIM accounts for a significant fraction (\u223c 30 \u2212 40%) of baryonic\nmass at z = 0, regardless of variations in spatial resolution,\ninput physics, or hydrodynamic algorithm. This is because\nthe evolution of the WHIM is driven primarily by shockheating of gas falling into gravitationally-generated potential wells, a process which is well-understood and modeled, and only secondarily by processes such as supernova\nfeedback, radiative cooling, and photoionization. Furthermore, most of the WHIM gas is at relatively low overdensities, so shock heating of intergalactic gas occurs during\nflows onto non-equilibrium large-scale structures such as\nfilaments. The majority of warm-hot gas is found outside of virialized objects such as galactic halos and galaxy\ngroups. The low overdensities explain why radiative cooling and supernova heating do not drive its evolution, and\nwhy the presence of this component probably does not violate constraints from the X-ray background, as we show\nin \u00a75. Finally, we briefly discuss strategies for direct detection of this gas, noting that the easiest place to detect emission from WHIM gas is relatively close to galaxies, where it is dense, even though most of the warm-hot\nbaryons are not in these regions. In summary, the WHIM\nis a robust and generic prediction of currently popular\nhierarchical structure formation models, and it contains\nroughly one-third of all baryons in the universe today.\n2. SIMULATIONS\n\nWe use six cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of\nrandomly-selected volumes in \u039b-dominated Cold Dark\nMatter universes, employing three different numerical\ntechniques, with a range of physical and numerical parameters. These parameters are summarized in Table 1.\nSimulations run with Parallel TreeSPH (Dav\u00e9, Dubinski &\n\nHernquist 1997) are labeled D1 and D2, simulations run\nwith TVD-PM (Ryu et al. 1993) are labeled C1 and C2,\nand simulations using Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR;\nBryan 1999) are labeled B1 and B2. The cosmology chosen\nis close to the \"concordance model\" which is in agreement\nwith a wide variety of observations (Bahcall et al. 1999).\nFor our purposes, the significant inputs are the variations in spatial resolution (1 \u2192 200h\u22121 kpc), baryonic\nmass resolution (2 \u00d7 107 \u2192 109 M\u2299 ), boxsize (11.11 \u2192\n100 h\u22121 Mpc), input physics, and hydrodynamic algorithms. D1 and D2 are high spatial resolution Lagrangian\n(particle-based) simulations, C1 and C2 are lower spatial resolution Eulerian simulations having high mass resolution and employing the Total Variation Diminishing\nscheme, and B1 and B2 are high resolution adaptive mesh\nsimulations based on the Piecewise Parabolic Method\n(note the exceptional resolution of \u223c 1h\u22121 kpc achieved by\nAMR in the high density regions). All simulations except\nB1 include radiative cooling from H and He, photoionization heating, and star formation; B1 includes none of\nthese. C1, C2, and B2 additionally include metal-line cooling, with the metallicity determined self-consistently from\nsupernova output. All simulations use a \u039b-dominated cold\ndark matter universe, having similar power at cluster and\ngalaxy scales. B2 has only been evolved to z = 0.75, but\nthis will be sufficient to indicate the relevant trends.\n3. EVOLUTION OF INTERGALACTIC GAS\n\nFigure 1 shows the evolution of the baryonic mass fraction in the four phases described above. The four panels\nshow results from simulations D1, D2, C1 and C2. Despite\ndifferences in simulation volume, resolution, and numerical method, the evolution of various phases is qualitatively\nsimilar. At high redshift (z >\n\u223c 2), the dominant fraction\nof baryons resides in diffuse gas (dashed lines) giving rise\nto Lyman alpha forest absorbers, as has been explored in\ndetail elsewhere (see Rauch 1998 for a review). As structure forms, diffuse gas is shock-heated, producing warmhot gas (solid lines). Gas that is driven to higher densi-\n\n\fDav\u00e9 et al.\nties due to gravitational instability is able to cool into the\ncondensed phase (dotted lines) and form stars. At lower\nredshifts (z <\n\u223c 2), large potential wells are produced that\nshock-heat gas to T > 107 K, giving rise to hot cluster gas\n(dot-dashed curves). Nevertheless, at the present epoch,\nthe total fraction of baryons in clusters is small.\n\n3\n\nand cold gas estimates its mass fraction to be around\n20% (Fukugita, Hogan & Peebles 1998). The simulations\nshown generally produce somewhat higher values for the\ncondensed fraction, but there are uncertainties in the contributions from low-mass stars and supernova remnants.\nOf these simulations, C2 contains the largest fraction of\ncondensed gas (\u223c 40%), while the rest are all lower, down\nto \u223c 25% for simulation C1. B1, of course, has virtually\nno condensed gas since it does not include cooling. In\nwhat follows, we will fix the condensed fraction to be 20%\nand redistribute the excess condensed gas equally among\nall the other components, assigning a somewhat arbitrary\nfraction of 1/3 of it to the WHIM (the only component\nwe examine from here on), in order to facilitate a less\nresolution-dependent comparison of the intergalactic components in these simulations.\n4. THE WARM-HOT INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM\n\n4.1. Evolution of \u03a9WHIM\n\nFigure 1: Evolution of mass fractions in four baryonic phases,\nin four simulations.\n\nFigure 1 shows that the fraction of diffuse baryons at\nthe present epoch is between 20% and 40%, the fraction\nof warm-hot baryons is 30 \u2212 40%. Gravitationally bound\nbaryons, i.e. those in stars, galactic gas, clusters, and intragroup media, make up the rest. Thus baryons in the\npresent-day universe are divided roughly equally among\ndiffuse, warm-hot, and bound components.\nWhile all the simulations are qualitatively similar, the\nexact distribution of gas in these phases is sensitive to details of the simulations. For instance, the condensed phase\nfraction is sensitive to how gas cools and forms stars in\nthese simulations, which in turn is significantly affected by\nresolution (since cooling and star formation \u221d \u03c12 ). Also,\nthe effect of supernova feedback heating depends strongly\non resolution, as we will discuss later. The growth of structure is affected by the amount of large-scale power present.\nIn particular, the hot gas fraction in clusters is sensitive\nto cosmic variance, since it is dominated by the largest\nvirialized objects in the volume. Other phases, including\nthe warm-hot phase, are less sensitive to volume effects,\nas we show in \u00a74.1.\nAll things considered, it is not surprising that there are\ndifferences up to a factor of two in the fractions in various\nphases at z = 0. While the differences may be significant, an investigation of their exact causes is beyond the\nscope of this work, though these differences offer clues into\nthe physical processes driving WHIM evolution, as we will\nexplore in \u00a74.1. Rather, we focus on the remarkable qualitative consistency in the evolution of various gas phases,\ngiven the variety of simulation methodologies utilized.\nFor the condensed phase, a census of baryons in stars\n\nFigure 2: Evolution of \u03a9WHIM in our six simulations. For this\ncomparison, the baryonic fraction in cold galactic gas and stars\nhas been fixed at 20% in all simulations.\n\nFigure 2 shows the evolution of the mass fraction of\nbaryons in warm-hot gas, \u03a9WHIM /\u03a9b , for our six simulations, with the condensed component having been fixed\nat 20%. C1 and C2 have the highest WHIM fractions, at\n42% and 35% of baryonic mass, respectively, at z = 0. D1\nand D2 have lower WHIM fractions at the present epoch,\naround \u223c 30%. B2 has only been evolved to z = 0.75, but\nits evolution closely mirrors that of the Lagrangian runs,\nso we expect its WHIM fraction will also be \u223c 30% by\nz = 0. These values are listed in Table 1. By the present\nepoch, all simulations have WHIM fractions within 50% of\neach other. Simulation B1 does not include radiative cooling, so it is an unphysical model that will only be used for\ncomparison with B2.\nWe expect that the evolution of warm-hot gas is governed by shock heating of intergalactic gas onto large-scale\nstructure, supernova feedback, and radiative cooling. Numerical considerations such as resolution, volume and hydrodynamic algorithm may also play a role. In this section we use case-by-case comparisons among our six simulations to examine how each of these processes affects\nWHIM evolution in our models.\nAll of our simulations explicitly include the growth of\nstructures and the accretion of gas onto those structures.\nThe qualitative consistency of WHIM evolution in all our\n\n\f4\n\nThe Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium\n\nsimulations, including simulation B1 without cooling or\nstar formation, suggests that gravitational shock heating\nof gas falling on large-scale structures is the dominant\nheating mechanism for WHIM gas. This is an important\npoint, as it suggests that all other differences between these\nsimulations are of secondary importance.\nThe most obvious differences between models are that\nD1, D2 and B2 all predict similar WHIM evolution, while\nC1 and C2 have more WHIM gas. The primary distinction between these sets of simulations is spatial resolution. This manifests itself in various ways, as it affects\ngas cooling, the rate at which stars form, and the the\ninjection of supernova heat energy into intergalactic gas.\nTo elaborate on this last point, high-resolution runs (D1,\nD2, B2) deposit feedback energy (thermal only) locally\nin very high density regions where stars are forming, and\nthus it quickly radiates away, with virtually none of it being distributed into the intergalactic medium. Conversely,\nlower-resolution runs (C1 and C2) deposit the same supernova energy over hundreds of kiloparsecs, resulting in\na significant fraction of feedback energy escaping into diffuse regions where it cannot radiatively cool away. None\nof the simulations here are capable of resolving supernovadriven galactic winds through a multi-phase interstellar\nmedium, which are likely to be responsible for distributing\nenergy and metals into the diffuse IGM (Mac Low 2000;\nEfstathiou 2000), thus we are relying on heuristic modeling of these processes. As we discuss in \u00a74.2, it is in the\ndistribution of feedback energy where resolution plays its\nmost crucial role in predicting the evolution of WHIM gas.\nFirst we examine the effect of radiative cooling. Simulation B1 has no cooling, whereas simulation B2 is a similar run with cooling (and is our highest spatial resolution\nrun). Cooling has a greater effect at earlier times because\nintergalactic gas is denser then and thus can cool significantly. After z \u223c 3, the rate of growth of the WHIM\nfraction is similar in B1 and B2, suggesting that WHIM\ngas is no longer affected by cooling. Even by z = 0.75,\nthe difference between B1 and B2 is not large, indicating\nthat cooling plays a minor role in the overall evolution of\nWHIM gas.\nEulerian codes resolve shock fronts better than SPH in\ndiffuse regions (Kang et al. 1994), because they have a\nhigher density of resolution elements there, and, in the case\nof the Eulerian codes discussed here, because they incorporate explicit shock capturing algorithms to resolve fronts\nover two cells. If a significant component of shock heating\narises from small-scale shocks unresolved by SPH, Eulerian codes may produce higher temperatures. One might\nsuspect that the difference between PTreeSPH runs and\nTVD-PM runs could be partially due to this effect. However, B2 is also an Eulerian simulation, yet it has nearly\nthe same WHIM fraction as the Lagrangian runs. So this\ncannot be a significant effect.\nSimulation volume could also play a role in the amount\nof WHIM gas, since larger volumes contain larger perturbations that can result in stronger gravitational shock\nheating. This may explain the difference between C1 and\nC2, whose box lengths differ by a factor of two. However,\nD1 has a box length five times that of D2, yet their WHIM\nfractions are nearly identical at all times. Furthermore, B2\nhas twice the box length of D1, yet its WHIM fraction is\nin good agreement with D1 and D2. As we will show in\n\nthe next section, typical WHIM gas is at very moderate\noverdensities, and cosmic variance in that regime is typically small, in contrast to the hot IGM fraction which is\ndominated by rare, massive objects (i.e. clusters) whose\nnumbers are more sensitive to simulation volume.\nIt is possible that opposing effects are causing D1, D2\nand B2 to be similar. For instance, D1 resolves shock\nfronts better than D2, perhaps resulting in more shock\nheating and making up for its lack of large-scale power.\nIt is also possible that the adaptive refinement of B2 results in more cooling in shock fronts, compensating for its\nlarger volume. However, unless all of these effects are of\nsecondary importance, cancellations at the level we find\nhere would require a remarkable coincidence.\nThe parameters of the underlying cosmological model\nare expected to have a non-negligible effect on the WHIM\ncomponent. The rate of structure evolution in large part\ndetermines how much shock-heated gas is present at any\nepoch. While we have not sampled a range of cosmologies\nhere, DHKW examined four cosmologies, namely \u039bCDM,\nTilted CDM, Cold+Hot DM, and Open CDM models, using numerical parameters similar to those of simulation\nD2. The differences between the WHIM fractions (called\n\"shocked\" gas in DHKW) in those models at the current\nepoch is comparable to the differences seen here due to\nother factors, as indicated by their Figure 12. Similarly,\nCO99 examined \u039bCDM, Cold+Hot DM, and Open CDM\nmodels, and also found broad consistency. Thus while our\nquoted fractions may be specifically for a \u039bCDM cosmology, our qualitative conclusions are unlikely to be highly\nsensitive to cosmology.\nIn summary, the evolution of \u03a9WHIM is qualitatively\nconsistent among all simulations examined, and results in\n\u2248 30 \u2212 40% of baryons residing in the WHIM today. Radiative cooling, simulation volume, and algorithmic details\ndo not significantly affect WHIM evolution in these runs.\n\nFigure 3: WHIM gas in simulation C2. Contours are color\ncoded by overdensity; green represents overdensity \u03b4 \u223c 10,\nwhile red shows \u03b4 \u223c 104 .\n\n\fDav\u00e9 et al.\n4.2. The Physics of WHIM Gas\nWe now explore the physics that drives the formation\nand evolution of WHIM gas. A qualitative physical picture of WHIM gas may be obtained by examining Figure 3, which shows the location of gas in simulation C2\nhaving 105 < T < 107 K, with contours color-coded by\ndensity. WHIM gas is seen to primarily trace out filamentary large-scale structures. Like the intergalactic medium,\nWHIM gas does cluster around dense regions that are sites\nof galaxy formation. However, we will show below that the\nmajority of WHIM gas is contained in the filaments.\n\nFigure 4: Top panel shows the mass fraction of WHIM gas as a\nfunction of density at z = 0 in our simulations. Bottom panel\nshows the same quantity at z = 0, 1, 2, 3 in simulation D1.\n\nThe top panel of Figure 4 quantifies the spatial distribution of WHIM gas in the universe. It shows a histogram of\nWHIM gas mass as a function of density, for simulations\nD1, D2, C1, and C2. All four simulations consistently\nshow that the dominant fraction of WHIM gas is at relatively low densities, with a peak around an overdensity of\n\u223c 10 \u2212 30. Simulations B1 and B2 are not shown because\nB1 does not include cooling and B2 has only been evolved\nto z = 0.75. Still, B1 at z = 0 and B2 at z = 0.75 show\npeak overdensities of 18 and 21, respectively, so they are\nconsistent with the other simulations. 70 \u2212 80% of WHIM\nbaryons lie in the overdensity range 5 < \u03b4 < 200, typical\nof filaments.\nThe typical overdensities of WHIM gas are much smaller\nthan that of matter contained in bound, virialized objects.\nA maximal estimate of the bound fraction of WHIM gas\nmay be obtained as the fraction of WHIM gas with \u03b4 >\n\u223c 60,\nwhich is approximately the overdensity at the virial radius\nof an isothermal sphere in a \u039bCDM cosmology. The mass\nfraction of WHIM gas with \u03b4 >\n\u223c 60 is \u2248 30% in our simulations. Clearly some of this gas will not be bound, but\n1 http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/TSEGA/tools/skid.html\n\n5\n\nrather infalling material. As an independent check, we use\nthe group finding algorithm SKID1 (Spline Kernel Interpolative DENMAX) to identify bound warm-hot particles\nin simulation D1, and find a bound fraction of WHIM\ngas between \u223c 10% and \u223c 25%, depending on the linking\nlength used (50 \u2212 500h\u22121kpc). The lower end of this range\nprobably corresponds to gas contained in galactic halos,\nalthough the extent of a galactic halo becomes ill-defined\nwhen it resides within a group or cluster. In summary,\nWHIM gas is mostly an intergalactic component, with a\nmajority of it residing outside of virialized structures such\nas galaxies or groups. Note that coronal gas in galaxies\nalso lies in the warm-hot temperature range, but it is a\nvery small fraction of the galactic baryonic mass, as most\ngalactic baryons are tied up in stars and cold gas.\nHow can intergalactic gas be heated to T > 105 K without being bound in a massive virialized halo? One way\nwould be if energy was added from non-thermal processes\nsuch as supernova feedback. However, this is not the driving process for WHIM gas in these simulations. Supernova\nfeedback energy is added in all simulations shown in Figure 4, but in simulations D1, D2 and B2 the effect is negligible, since, as discussed before, feedback is added purely\nthermally into very dense regions, where it radiates away\nalmost immediately and adds no heat to diffuse regions.\nBut even in these high-resolution simulations, where supernovae add negligible heat to WHIM gas, the typical\noverdensities are smaller than those typical of virialized\nhalos.\nSupernova heating is, however, likely to be responsible\nfor the somewhat lower overdensities in simulations C1\nand C2 as compared to the higher resolution simulations,\nso its effect is non-negligible. The differences cannot be\ndue to other spatial resolution effects such as cooling, as\nC1 and C2 are themselves quite similar, as are D1 and D2.\nInstead, the lower spatial resolution in C1 and C2 results\nin significant supernova energy being deposited in intergalactic gas, as described in the previous section. This\nadditional feedback heating raises the pressure of intergalactic gas and lowers the typical density. Furthermore,\nbecause supernova energy is not radiated away immediately, there is a small component of warm-hot gas in and\naround galaxies seen as the high-density bump for C1 and\nC2 in Figure 4. Note that the densities in D1 and D2 are\ncomputed slightly differently than in C1 and C2; in the\nformer, Lagrangian runs, the density field is smoothed by\nthe (variable) smoothing length of the particle, while in the\nEulerian runs the smoothing is fixed at the cell size. However, since in both cases the smoothing is done on scales\nsmaller than the density variations, this is not expected to\nproduce any systematic differences in the resulting densities.\nThe effect of supernova heating can be roughly estimated by the following simple argument. Consider two\nextreme cases, one where all supernova energy is deposited\nwithin dense regions where it immediately radiates away,\nand another where supernova energy is distributed uniformly over all baryons in the universe. The former case\nis a reasonable approximation for the Lagrangian runs D1\nand D2 as well as the high-resolution AMR run B2, while\nthe latter is closer to the Eulerian runs C1 and C2 (though\n\n\f6\n\nThe Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium\n\nclearly a much more extreme case). In the former case, supernovae add no heat to WHIM gas. In the latter, the specific heat added per baryon yields a temperature increase\nof\n\n\u03b4TSN =\n\n\u03a9\u2217 \u03c1crit \u01ebSN\n,\nkB n\u0304H\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a9\u2217 is the cosmic mass fraction in stars, \u03c1crit is the\ncritical density, \u01ebSN is the specific energy output per unit\nmass of stars formed, and n\u0304H is the mean number density of H atoms. We take \u03a9\u2217 = 0.1\u03a9b = 0.002h\u22122, and\n\u01ebSN = 2.5 \u00d7 1048 erg g\u22121 M\u2299 from a Salpeter IMF with\neach supernova from a star with M > 8M\u2299 outputting\n1051 ergs. Then, \u03b4TSN = 0.2 keV \u2248 2 \u00d7 106 K. Assuming\n3\nisentropic heat distribution, \u03c1T 2 = constant, so gas with\nT \u2248 4 \u00d7 106 K (the maximum of the temperature distribution, as we will show in Figure 5) will have its density\nreduced by roughly a factor of two compared to the no\nheating case. This is roughly the level of reduction seen in\nthe Eulerian as compared to the Lagrangian runs. Clearly\nthis model is overly simplistic, as it would predict that\n6\nall intergalactic gas has T >\n\u223c 10 K, but it does roughly\nindicate the magnitude of the effect of supernova heating.\nNote that there are no other heating processes in these\nsimulations that contribute significantly to the WHIM. For\ninstance, photoionization only heats gas to \u223c 104 K. Any\nother heating process one could devise, such as cosmic\nrays or supernovae occuring in dwarf galaxies in voids,\nwould add more pressure support to the gas, and thus\nwould push the typical density of WHIM gas even lower.\nThus our simulations indicate that WHIM gas is heated\nto T > 105 K primarily by shock-heating of gas accreting onto large-scale structure. These structures, typically\nfilamentary, are not virialized or in dynamical equilibrium.\nIn the previous section we showed empirically that radiative cooling has a minor effect on WHIM evolution.\nThis may be understood physically given that warm-hot\ngas is typically at such low overdensities that it cannot collapse into virialized objects, and due to the metagalactic\nphotoionizing background most intergalactic gas lies well\nwithin the optically thin regime (see DHKW, Figure 10).\nThus typical WHIM gas is too diffuse to self-gravitate or\nself-shield, and has no way to achieve the densities required\nto make radiative processes important. Improving the numerical resolution of our simulations would not change this\nresult, as it is based on simple physical arguments.\nThe bottom panel of Figure 4 shows a histogram of\nWHIM gas mass for the D1 model at z = 0, 1, 2, 3 (solid,\ndotted, dashed, long dashed lines). There is a slight trend\nto higher overdensities at earlier times, since at early times\nthe contribution from virialized structures is greater. This\nis because gas has not had time to accrete and shock on\nmore diffuse structures, and the largest structures at earlier times have lower temperatures that can fall into the\nwarm-hot range. Still, this is a minor effect; basically, the\npeak overdensity does not evolve significantly with redshift.\n\nFigure 5: The mass fraction of baryons as a function of temperature in simulation D1, at z = 0 (solid), z = 1 (dotted),\nz = 2 (short dashed) and z = 3 (long dashed). The arrows indicate the predicted peak temperature from gravitational shock\nheating at various z, from equation 2.\n\nFigure 5 shows the temperature distribution of intergalactic gas with T > 104.5 K in simulation D1 at z =\n0, 1, 2, 3. The amount of gas at these warm-hot and hot\ntemperatures grows with time, as seen from Figures 1 and\n2. The temperature at the peak of the distribution grows\nin time as well, reflecting the fact that the universe contains hotter structures at later times. The peak temperature at all redshifts falls within the warm-hot range, and\nby z = 0 it is up to \u223c 4 \u00d7 106 K. Note that this is close\nto the temperature of the excess diffuse emission seen by\nWang & McCray (1993) in ROSAT data. Figure 5 also\nshows that the mass of the WHIM component is insensitive to our somewhat arbitrary choice of 105 K as the\ndefining lower temperature. A choice of 104.5 K (as in\nDHKW) or even 105.5 K would not drastically affect our\nconclusions.\nAn analytic estimate of the evolution of the peak temperature can be obtained by considering the temperature\nof intergalactic gas shock heated on mildly nonlinear largescale structure. If the length scale going nonlinear at a\ngiven epoch is Lnl , and the perturbation collapses on a\ntimescale t, the resulting sound speed behind the shock\nwill be \u223c Lnl /t. Given that the perturbation has taken a\nHubble time to collapse, t \u223c H \u22121 , where H is the Hubble\nconstant at time t. The resulting post-shock temperature\nis then (CO99)\nTnl \u221d c2nl = K(HLnl )2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere K is a constant, at any given epoch. The value of\nTnl , with K = 0.3, is shown at each redshift plotted in\nFigure 5 by the arrows above each curve. This value of K\nproduces roughly the correct peak temperature at z = 0,\nand as can be seen from Figure 5, it is a reasonable fit\nto the peak temperature at higher redshifts, though it becomes progressively more difficult to identify a peak. This\nvalue of K also produces the correct evolution of the globally averaged temperature in simulations C1 and C2, as\nshown in CO99. Thus the evolution of the temperature\ndistribution of WHIM gas is consistent with the interpretation that it is heated by gravitationally-induced shocks\non mildly nonlinear large-scale structure. Since there is a\nwide range in the properties of the collapsing structures\nand therefore infall velocities, there is also a wide range in\ngas temperatures.\n\n\fDav\u00e9 et al.\n\nFigure 6: Contours in temperature and density for simulation\nD1 at z = 0, enclosing 10%, 50% and 90% of the baryons in\nthe range shown. Density and temperature are correlated in the\nWHIM regime. Thick line indicates a scaling of \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304b = T /104.7\nin the warm-hot temperature range.\n\nThe temperature and density of WHIM gas are correlated. Figure 6 shows a contour plot of mass within the\nwarm-hot range, as a function of density and temperature, for the D1 model at z = 0. The contour levels enclose 10%, 50% and 90% of the mass in the temperature\nand density ranges shown in the plot. The thick line indicates an \"equation of state\" \u03c1 \u221d T that provides a reasonable fit to gas in the range 105 < T < 107 K. This\nrelationship is different from that of diffuse gas, which\ntypically has \u03c1 \u221d T 1.7 , and the temperature-density relation of WHIM gas has much greater scatter. The higher\ntemperature, different slope, and greater scatter all reflect\nthe importance of shock heating as the dominant mechanism controlling the thermal properties of WHIM gas;\nthe \"equation of state\" for diffuse gas, on the other hand,\narises from the competition between photoionization and\nadiabatic cooling due to Hubble expansion (Hui & Gnedin\n1997). Figure 6 also suggests that detecting WHIM gas in\nemission will be easier for gas that is at the highest end\nof the WHIM temperature range, since that gas will be\nboth denser and hotter. However, the dominant portion\nof WHIM gas is at lower temperatures, which is perhaps\nmost easily detected via absorption lines (Tripp, Savage &\nJenkins 2000).\n5. CONSTRAINTS FROM THE SOFT X-RAY BACKGROUND\n\nGas with temperatures in the range 105 < T < 107 K\nwill emit thermally in the soft X-ray band. The extragalactic soft X-ray foreground (SXRB) flux at 0.1-0.4 keV\nis roughly \u223c 20 \u2212 35 keV cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 (Warwick\n& Roberts 1998), though uncertainties are large because\ngalactic coronal gas provides an increasing foreground to\nlower energies. At slightly higher energies (\u223c 1 keV),\nthe XRB has further been resolved nearly completely\n(\u223c 80 \u2212 90%) into point sources, mostly AGN (Mushotsky et al. 2000). Reasonable arguments then allow only\na small contribution to the SXRB from diffuse gas, <\n\u223c\n4 keV cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 (Wu, Fabian & Nusser 1999,\nhereafter WFN). Such a limit, in principle, places constraints on the amount of gas in the universe at warm-hot\ntemperatures.\nThese limits were explored in two independent papers\nusing similar methodologies, WFN and Pen (1999). Both\npapers argue that the standard picture of hierarchical formation of virialized objects results in a predicted SXRB\n\n7\n\nthat exceeds the observed limits. They suggest that significant non-gravitational heating, typically \u223c 1 keV per\nbaryon, is required to unbind warm-hot gas from virialized objects in order to satisfy the SXRB constraints. In\nthis section we discuss these constraints in the context of\nWHIM gas, and find that our simulations paint a very\ndifferent picture for soft X-ray emission than the simple\nmodels assumed in those two papers. A full calculation\nof the SXRB from these simulations is a complicated undertaking (because of metallicity, bandpass, and numerical\nissues) that is beyond the scope of this paper. However,\nthe physical properties of WHIM gas in the simulations\nare quite different from the properties assumed by WFN\nand Pen (1998), and we will show that scaling our results\nto theirs suggests that the observed SXRB flux does not\nrule out the WHIM predicted by these simulations. The\nessential difference is one of density. Both WFN and Pen\n(1998) base their calculations on a Press-Schecter (1974)\nanalysis, which implicitly assumes that gas is in virialized\nobjects with typical overdensity >\n\u223c 200. However, most of\nthe WHIM gas in the simulations is in lower-density filamentary structures rather than virialized objects, thus the\nSXRB emission is lower (cf. Figure 5).\nWe can quantify this difference in typical overdensity by\nconsidering the clumping factor of the emitting gas. If we\ndefine the clumping factor for gas component g as\nCg \u2261< \u03c12g > / < \u03c1g >2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nthen the free-free emissivity from that component is\n\u01ebSXRB \u221d < \u03c12g Tg0.5 > \u221d Cg \u03a92g Tg0.5 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c1g , \u03a9g , Tg \u2248 106 K, and Cg are the density, mass\nfraction, temperature, and clumping factor of the gas emitting in soft X-rays. The flux jSXRB of soft X-ray background is then the emissitivity multiplied by path length\n\u223c 13 cH \u22121 . WFN argue, sensibly, that it is predominantly\nwarm-hot gas (105 < T < 107 K) that is responsible for\nsoft X-ray emission. This means the appropriate clumping\nfactor Cg is that of warm-hot gas, CWHIM .\nThere are several ways to calculate CWHIM in our simulations. One can directly calculate it from equation 3,\nwhich is the approach we use for our Eulerian simulations.\nFor Lagrangian simulations, because each particle represents a different volume of gas, it becomes more numerically convenient to calculate CWHIM \u2248 \u03beWHIM (0), where\n\u03beWHIM (r) is the two-point correlation function of WHIM\ngas at radius r.\nThe resulting CWHIM values for our simulations at z = 0\nare listed in Table 1. All simulations show clumping factors in the range \u223c 30 \u2212 400. The smaller clumping factors\nin C1 and C2 arise directly because the WHIM gas is typically less dense in these models as compared to D1, D2, B1\nand B2 due to greater supernova feedback in the diffuse\nIGM, as explained before.\nOur clumping factors are significantly less than that\nused by Pen (1999), who adopts C >\n\u223c 900 and argues\n4\nC >\n10\n.\nThe\nreason\nis\nthat\nthe\nclumping\nfactor of Pen\n\u223c\n(1999) is actually that of all gas (assumed to trace the dark\nmatter), not the warm-hot baryons. Such a clumping factor is dominated by the contribution from galaxies and\nother collapsed, virialized structures. This is not the appropriate clumping factor with which to calculate the soft\n\n\f8\n\nThe Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium\n\nX-ray background, since as we have shown in the previous\nsection, WHIM gas is typically at much lower overdensities than virialized structures. In Pen (1999), the clumping\nfactor is strongly dependent on simulation resolution, because it is dominated by the highest overdensity objects.\nAmongst our simulations, a wide range of resolutions give\nbarely an order of magnitude difference in clumping factor,\nsince the WHIM gas is predominantly diffuse.\nPen (1999) determines that \u223c 1 keV of non-gravitational\nheating would reduce his clumping factor to C <\n\u223c 60, which\nhe argues is necessary to satisfy XRB constraints. However, this was derived assuming that all gas contributes to\nthe SXRB (see his eq. 2), whereas in our simulations only\n\u223c 30% of the baryons contribute to the SXRB (probably\nan even smaller fraction since the narrow range of SXRB\nenergies arises from a narrower range of gas temperatures\nthan 105 < T < 107 K). From equation 4, we see that a\nreduction in \u03a9g , the mean density of emitting gas, results\nin an increase in the maximum allowed clumping factor\nby (\u03a9b /\u03a9WHIM )2 \u2248 10. Thus his analytically-derived constraint translates to CWHIM <\n\u223c 600. Our clumping factors\n(<\n400)\nare\nconsistent\nwith\nhis analysis, despite the fact\n\u223c\nthat WHIM gas in our simulations undergoes almost no\nnon-gravitational heating.\nWFN present a more detailed model from which we can\ncrudely estimate our SXRB by comparison. They do not\nspecifically use clumping factors to predict the SXRB in\ntheir model, but they perform a similar calculation to that\nof Pen (1999), based on a Press-Schecter analysis with an\nassumed halo profile. The Press-Schecter formalism makes\ntwo assumptions about how gas is distributed and heated\nin the universe: (1) All soft X-ray emitting gas is bound in\nvirialized halos (namely, groups of galaxies); (2) Gas can\nonly be heated by accretion onto a virialized halo, with the\ngas temperature set by the virial temperature of the halo.\nUnlike Pen (1999), they allow some gas to cool and therefore not emit in X-rays, but this is a small correction. In\ntheir model, the gas clumping factor is the clumping factor\nof virialized objects, since they are assuming that emitting\ngas solely resides in such objects.\nOur simulations suggest that both Press-Schecter assumptions are strongly violated in the case of WHIM gas.\nFirst, only a small fraction of WHIM gas is bound in virialized halos; most is distributed much more diffusely. Second, in our simulations, intergalactic gas can be heated\nsignificantly by purely gravitational processes prior to being accreted onto a virialized object.\n\nThe two-point correlation function \u03beWHIM illustrates\nquite clearly that WHIM gas is not bound in virialized\nhalos, and is instead associated with large-scale structure.\nFigure 7 shows \u03beWHIM for simulation D1 (solid line), D2\n(dashed), as well as \u03begalaxy (dotted line) calculated from\nD1. \u03begalaxy is computed as the correlation function of all\nstar particles in this simulation, where stars are formed\nslowly out of cold, dense gas and are seen to trace the\ngalaxy population (see Katz, Weinberg & Hernquist 1996).\nAt scales less than a few hundred kpc, \u03beWHIM flattens, indicating that WHIM gas does not cluster on scales smaller\nthan those typical of large-scale structures. Conversely,\nthe galaxy correlation function continues as approximately\na power law in to the resolution limit of our simulation.\nThe clumping factor of WHIM gas, \u03beWHIM (0), is welldefined since we can meaningfully extrapolate from our\nresolution limit to r = 0. This is not true for the clumping\nfactor of galaxies, for which we may only set a lower limit\n4\n(consistent with Pen 1999), Cgalaxy >\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 10 .\nWe can crudely estimate the SXRB flux we would predict in comparison to that predicted by WFN by multiplying their predicted jSXRB by CWHIM /Cgalaxy . This corrects for the fact that they use virialized objects (which we\ntake as galaxies) instead of the true diffuse WHIM responsible for SXRB emission. Thus we would roughly predict a\nSXRB flux that is two orders of magnitude lower than that\npredicted by WFN. Examining their Figure 2 or 3 shows\nthat such a reduction in jSXRB makes the SXRB contribution from warm-hot gas consistent with observational\nlimits.\nIn summary, the discrepancies in the predicted soft XRB\nversus previous studies arise from their use of a PressSchecter analysis, or an equivalent method that implicitly places emitting gas into virialized objects, in order to\nstudy an intergalactic component of baryons that is inherently much more diffuse. These methods do not allow\nfor gravitational shock heating in unbound objects such\nas filaments, thus they are forced to postulate significant\nnon-gravitational heating to make the emitting gas more\ndiffuse. In our scenario, most WHIM gas has never fallen\ninto virialized objects, though it is still heated (almost)\npurely via gravitational processes. Scaling previous analyses by the typical overdensities found in our simulations\nsuggests that the properties of the predicted WHIM are\nconsistent with SXRB constraints. However, these scaling arguments are approximate at best, and not enough\nto guarantee consistency. More accurate calculations of\nX-ray emission from these simulations are certainly warranted and may yield interesting constraints on the WHIM\ncomponent; these issues will be addressed in detail in separate papers (Fardal et al., in preparation; Phillips et al.,\nin preparation).\n6. SUMMARY\n\nFigure 7: Two-point correlation functions for WHIM gas from\nsimulation D1 (solid line) and D2 (dashed line), and for galaxies\nfrom simulation D1 (dotted line).\n\nWe study the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM),\ndefined as all the gas in the universe with temperature\n105 < T < 107 K, in six cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with widely varying spatial resolutions, volumes,\ncode algorithms, and input physics. In each simulation,\nthe WHIM contains \u2248 30 \u2212 40% of all baryons in the\npresent-day universe. As a rule of thumb, our simulations predict that the fractions of baryons in the warm-\n\n\fDav\u00e9 et al.\nhot phase, the diffuse phase, and gravitationally bound\nsystems are roughly comparable at the present epoch.\nThe WHIM is comprised primarily of gas at moderate overdensities, with a median overdensity \u223c 10 \u2212 30,\nand is predominantly an intergalactic component. It is\nshock-heated by accretion onto non-equilibrium filamentary large-scale structures, with possibly a small energy\ncontribution from non-gravitational processes such as supernova feedback. Despite being heated primarily by gravitational processes, WHIM gas in our simulations is consistent with constraints from the soft X-ray background. The\nclumping factors of WHIM gas in our simulations range\nfrom \u223c 30 \u2212 400, which are far below that of virialized\n4\nobjects (>\n\u223c 10 ) that some studies assume are the sources\nof soft XRB photons.\nDifferent simulations give somewhat different fractions\nof WHIM gas at the present epoch, though the fraction is\nsignificant in all simulations. We argue that the differences\nare primarily attributable to resolution effects, specifically\nmanifested in the distribution of supernova feedback energy in different simulations. In high spatial resolution\nsimulations, the added heat remains in dense regions and\nradiates away almost immediately, whereas in lower spatial\nresolution simulations a significant fraction of heat ends up\nin diffuse intergalactic gas where it cannot radiate away.\nStill, the differences in present-day WHIM fraction are not\nlarge between these two somewhat extreme cases for feedback. Radiative cooling plays a minor role in the evolution\nof warm-hot gas because it is mostly at low densities, and is\ntoo diffuse to self-gravitate and self-shield into mini-halos.\nOther physical effects such as star formation, photoionization, and cosmic variance do not produce significant\ndifferences in the amount or properties of warm-hot gas in\nour simulations.\nSince the exact predicted fraction of WHIM gas is as yet\nsensitive to simulation details, it would be greatly beneficial to place observational constraints on this component.\nAs mentioned before, this is a challenging task. Still, there\nare tantalizing hints of detections of WHIM gas. Wang &\nMcCray (1993) found an excess emission component in\nROSAT data around T \u223c 2 \u00d7 106 K, which may be arising\nfrom this diffuse component. Soltan et al. (1996) detected\nan auto-correlation signature between the soft X-ray background and galaxies, as would be expected if warm-hot gas\nwas distributed in large-scale structures. Even more exciting is a possible direct detection of diffuse soft X-ray emission associated with a filament of galaxies, by Scharf et al.\n(2000). Somewhat stronger evidence comes from a census\n\n9\n\nof O VI absorbers at redshifts 0.14 <\n\u223cz<\n\u223c 0.27 (Tripp, Savage & Jenkins 2000; Tripp & Savage 2000), which together\nwith conservative ionization corrections and metallicities\n+0.004 \u22121\nimplies \u03a9WHIM >\n\u223c 0.003\u22120.002h75 , or \u03a9WHIM /\u03a9b >\n\u223c 10% at\nthe present epoch. However, some of these O VI absorbers\nmay be photoionized, arising in cooler, low-density intergalactic gas at T \u223c 104 K.\nWHIM gas emission may be easiest to detect around\nhigh density regions such as clusters because that is where\nthe density and temperature are highest within the WHIM\nrange (cf. Figure 6), but this is not where the majority of\nWHIM gas is located. For instance, high-resolution Chandra spectra of regions between clusters that are free of\nbright sources may provide a detectable signal (Phillips\net al., in preparation), and observations from XMM could\npossibly image filaments of warm-hot gas directly (Pierre,\nBryan & Gastaud 2000). Our simulations, however, predict the majority of WHIM gas is far away from galaxies\nand clusters, residing in the diffuse IGM. A promising avenue to detect this more typical WHIM gas is via absorption, as continuing observations with STIS aboard Hubble will detect many more O VI absorbers. Future X-ray\nsatellites may be able to detect higher ionization absorbers\nsuch as O VII and O VIII that may also trace WHIM gas\n(Hellsten, Gnedin & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 1998). The detection\nof this component is a key observational challenge, as the\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium is rapidly become an integral part of our understanding of the evolution of baryons\nin the universe.\n\nWe thank Jeff Gardner, Ed Jenkins, Richard Mushotsky, Arielle Phillips, Jim Peebles and Todd Tripp for helpful discussions.
