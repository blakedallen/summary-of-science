I now want to\nreturn to my roots and try to combine all these subjects\ntogether.\" It therefore seems appropriate to honour the\nmemory of Asher Peres with a paper that describes aspects of quantum information theory for observers in a\n(general) relativistic setting.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs a fundamental physical theory, relativistic quantum\ninformation theory (RQIT) has widespread applications,\nranging from practical tools for describing moving observers in quantum communication protocols, to black\nhole thermodynamics. For example, it is hoped that\nRQIT will play a central role in clock synchronization\nand (optical) quantum communication between a ground\nstation and a relativistically moving satellite, as well as\nthe resolution of the black hole information paradox.\nSo far, work on RQIT has focused predominantly on\nrelativistic transformations of single-particle wave functions. Early work by Czachor defined the relativistic spin\noperator for a relativistic description of the violation of\nBell inequalities [2]. Then Peres et al. showed that the\nreduced density matrix for the spin of an electron is not\na Lorentz invariant scalar [3], indicating that there is a\nspin-momentum interaction in Lorentz transformations.\nSubsequently, Alsing and Milburn determined the transformation properties of entangled particles in momentum eigenstates [4], and it was shown by Gingrich and\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: pieter.kok@hp.com\n\nAdami that spin and polarization entanglement between\ntwo Gaussian wave packets is transferred to momentum\nentanglement under Lorentz boosts [5, 6].\nMany of these results have been obtained using\nWigner's little group formalism [4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the\nlittle group is constructed from a standard momentum\nfour-vector that is invariant under Lorentz transformations, this formalism breaks down for arbitrary coordinate transformations. In addition, it is not always\nstraightforward to find the representations of the little\ngroup. For a wider application of relativistic results,\n\"plug-and-play\" transformation rules for the annihilation\noperator seem more appropriate.\nThese transformation rules are essential for the description of (multi-particle) quantum interferometry. In\nparticular, we are interested in a relativistic extension\nof linear optical quantum computing. In this paper, we\npresent a general technique for deriving the annihilation\noperator of the scalar field, the spin-1 vector field, the\nelectromagnetic field, and the spin- 21 Dirac field for arbitrary coordinate transformations, and we give the explicit\nresult for Lorentz transformations. We then give a unified description of the resulting Bogoliubov transformations and multi-particle quantum interferometry. This\nwill lead to a relativistic formulation of linear optical\nquantum computing [8].\nThere are several advantages to our technique: i) The\ntransformation laws are relatively easy to obtain by integration, rather than finding group representations. ii)\nThe resulting transformations are completely fundamental. iii) Our technique is applicable to any coordinate\ntransformation (including in the presence of curvature),\nand is not restricted to Lorentz boosts. In particular,\nit predicts particle creation for non-inertial motion. iv)\nSubstituting the transformed annihilation operator into\nspecific expressions of the state of a quantum field automatically yields the correct transformed state. This way,\nit is straightforward to describe boosted wave packets,\nand it allows us to study the transformation of entanglement in arbitrary coordinate systems.\n\n\f2\nIn the next section, we present a relativistic paradox,\nto put the issue on edge. In section III, we give the field\ntransformations for Lorentz-boosted quantum fields. In\nsection IV, we solve the paradox, and sketch relativistic multi-particle quantum interferometry and relativity.\nIn principle, this unification includes arbitrary particle\ncreation associated with non-inertial observers and observers on curved spacetime. Finally, we present our conclusions in section V.\n\nII.\n\nTHE TWIN-PHOTON PARADOX\n\nIn order to describe relativistic multi-particle quantum\ninterferometry, let's perform the following gedanken experiment: Two single-photon plane waves with momenta\nk1 and k2 , and polarization j \u2208 {H, V } meet at a 50:50\nbeam splitter. In the outgoing modes of the beam splitter\nwe place two ideal particle detectors, which tell us with\nperfect fidelity how many photons there are in that mode.\nIt is well known that a 50:50 beam splitter causes two\nidentical photons to \"pair off\" into the outgoing modes.\nIn other words, we will never find any coincidence counts\nbetween the two detectors. This is the so-called HongOu-Mandel effect [9]. Mathematically, the transformation of the incoming modes would be\n1\n\u00e2j (k1 ) \u2192 \u221a [\u00e2j (k1 ) + \u00e2j (k2 )] ,\n2\n1\n\u00e2j (k2 ) \u2192 \u221a [\u2212\u00e2j (k1 ) + \u00e2j (k2 )] .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nThe input state \u00e2\u2020j (k1 )\u00e2\u2020j (k2 )|0i is then transformed into\n\u20202\n1 \u20202\n2 [\u00e2j (k2 ) \u2212 \u00e2j (k1 )]|0i, where |0i denotes the vacuum.\nAn observer in a boosted frame of reference will see\nquite a different physical process taking place: To him,\nthe two waves do not necessarily have the same frequency and polarization. As a result, the two photons\nare not identical, and there will be coincidence counts\nin the detectors. However, photon counting yields numbers, which are Lorentz invariant. Consequently, both\nobservers should obtain exactly the same detector statistics. Thus we arrive at a contradiction.\nA similar paradox can be constructed for fermions.\nHere, the exclusion principle forbids identical particles\nfrom occupying the same quantum state, resulting in the\nabsence of two-fermion states in either output mode of\nthe fermionic beam splitter. Again, to a boosted observer\nthe fermions have different wavelengths and spin, leading to different detector statistics. In order to resolve\nthis paradox, we explicitly calculate the transformation\nrules for the annihilation operator of the quantum fields.\nFurthermore, both the twin-photon and the twin-electron\nparadox is an example of two-particle quantum interferometry.\n\nIII.\n\nFIELD TRANSFORMATIONS\nA.\n\nScalar fields\n\nThe scalar quantum field \u03c6(x) obeys the Klein-Gordon\nequation (\u2202\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc \u2212 m2 )\u03c6 = 0, where m is the mass of\nthe field, and Greek indices always denote components\nof a four-vector. It can be expanded in terms of mode\nfunctions f :\nZ\n\u0003\ndk \u0002\n\u03c6(x) =\n\u00e2(k)fk (x) + \u00e2\u2020 (k)fk\u2217 (x) ,\n2k0\n\nwhere k is the four-momentum, k is the three-vector component of k, and k0 is the energy component. The annihilation and creation operators associated with mode k are\n\u00e2(k) and \u00e2\u2020 (k) respectively. The annihilation operator is\nextracted using the time-independent inner product [10]:\n\n\u00e2(k) = i\n\nZ\n\n\u2194\n\nd3 x fk\u2217 (x) \u22020 \u03c6(x) \u2261 (fk , \u03c6) ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u2194\n\nwhere a(t) \u22020 b(t) = a(t)\u22020 b(t) \u2212 [\u22020 a(t)]b(t). Typically, we choose the plane-wave expansion fk (x) =\n1\n[(2\u03c0)3 2k0 ]\u2212 2 eikx , where kx \u2261 k\u03bc x\u03bc .\nAlice and Bob are two observers that occupy two different reference frames. Alice describes the field \u03c6(x) in\nterms of her coordinates x, whereas Bob describes the\nfield \u03c6(x\u2032 ) in terms of his coordinates x\u2032 . The two coordinate systems are connected by an invertible transformation. In this paper we will restrict ourselves to\nLorentz transformations \u039b such that x\u2032 = \u039b(x \u2212 l), with\nl an arbitrary translation. However, our results also apply to arbitrary coordinate transformations corresponding to non-inertial relative motion. In addition, Bob uses\nhis own definition of the annihilation and creation operators \u00e2\u2032 (k \u2032 ) and \u00e2\u2032\u2020 (k \u2032 ), and (plane wave) mode functions\ng(x\u2032 ). The question is now what are the transformation\nrules that relate \u00e2(k) and \u00e2\u2032 (k \u2032 ). To this end, we can\nextract Bob's annihilation operator:\nZ\n\u2194\n\u00e2\u2032 (k \u2032 ) = i d3 x\u2032 fk\u2217\u2032 (x\u2032 ) \u2202 0\u2032 \u03c6(x\u2032 ) .\n(3)\nAlternatively, Alice may describe the field \u03c6 in terms\nof her coordinates x(x\u2032 ). When we substitute this into\nEq. (3) and use k \u2032 = \u039bk, we obtain\n\u00e2\u2032 (\u039bk) = \u00e2(k) e\u2212i\u039bkl ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith a similar expression for the creation operators. It\nis clear that the bosonic commutation relations still hold\nfor \u00e2\u2032 and \u00e2\u2032\u2020 . The state of (multi-particle) wave packets can be expressed in terms of a function f of creation\noperators \u00e2\u2020 acting on a vacuum defined by \u00e2|0i = 0.\nSimilarly, the transformed annihilation operator defines\na vacuum state \u00e2\u2032 |0\u2032 i = 0. The state then transforms\n\u2020\nas f(\u00e2\u2020 )|0i \u2192 f(\u00e2\u2032 )|0\u2032 i. For Lorentz transformations,\n\n\f3\nthe vacuum states of Alice and Bob are identical. Other\ntransformations, however, change the vacuum state. Alice and Bob then no longer agree upon the number of\nparticles in the experiment.\nIn general, since quantum states can be expressed in\nterms of a function of creation operators \u00e2\u2020 acting on\nthe vacuum |0i, substituting this transformation rule \u00e2\u2032\u2020\non the vacuum |0\u2032 i will immediately yield the correctly\ntransformed quantum state.\n\nB.\n\nSpin-1 massive boson fields\n\nThe simplest extension to the Klein-Gordon field is the\nspin-1 degree of freedom, yielding a vector field V \u03bc (x)\nwith mass m:\n\" \u03bc\n#\nZ\n1\nd k X \u01ebj \u00e2j (k)eikx\n\u03bc\np\nV (x) =\n+ H.c. ,\n2k0 j=\u22121\n(2\u03c0)3 2k0\n\nwhere \u01eb\u03bcj is the four-vector associated with the jcomponent of the field, and H.c. stands for Hermitian\nconjugate. The field obeys the Lorentz gauge \u2202\u03bc V \u03bc =\nk\u03bc \u01eb\u03bcj = 0, which, for a particle at rest suggests the representation k = (m, 0, 0, 0), \u01eb1 = (0, 1, 0, 0), \u01eb0 = (0, 0, 1, 0)\nand \u01eb\u22121 = (0, 0, 0, 1). The relativistic transformation of\nthe vector field is given by\n\u039b\u03bc \u03bd V \u03bd (x) =\n\nZ\n\nd k X \u03bc \u01eb\u03bdj \u00e2j (k)eikx\n\u039b \u03bdp\n+ H.c.\n2k0 j\n(2\u03c0)3 2k0\n\n1\nX\n\n\u01eb\u2217\u03bc,j \u039b\u03bc \u03bd \u01eb\u03bdl \u00e2l (k) e\u2212i\u039bkl .\n\nwhich obeys the bosonic commutation relations.

In addition to the Lorentz gauge, it has to obey a second gauge\nrelation, usually the Coulomb gauge \u2207 * A = k * \u01ebj = 0.\nIn this gauge, there is no longitudinal polarization. Since\nk\u03bc \u01eb\u03bcj is an invariant scalar, Lorentz transformations will\nkeep the field in the Lorentz gauge. However, this is not\ntrue for the Coulomb gauge, and since this is the gauge\nthat is typically used in the description of multi-particle\ninterferometry, we need to take this change into account\nin our calculation.\nThe gauge freedom means that we can add the derivatives of two massless Klein-Gordon scalar fields \u03c6j to the\nvector potential in order to change the gauge:\n\n\u039b\u03bc \u03bd A\u03bd (x) =\n\nExtracting the annihilation operator using fk\u03bc (x) =\n1\n[(2\u03c0)3 2k0 ] 2 \u01eb\u03bcj eikx then yields\n\u00e2\u2032j (\u039bk) =\n\nneed to take into account.

This leads to the\nfollowing Bogoliubov transformation for polarized light:\nX\n\u00e2\u2032j (\u039bk) =\n\u01eb\u2217j,\u03bc * \u01eb\u0303\u03bcl \u00e2l (k) e\u2212i\u039bkl .\n(10)\nl\n\nWe will now evaluate \u01eb\u0303\u03bcj . A Lorentz transformation \u039b\ncan be written as a combination of a pure boost L and\ntwo spatial rotations R1 and R2 such that \u039b = R2 LR1 .\nNote that R1 and R2 are 4 \u00d7 4 matrices of the from\n1 \u2295 R, with R a 3 \u00d7 3 rotation matrix and 1 the onedimensional unit matrix. Using Eq. (8) with \u039b = L,\nwe find after some algebra that the polarization of the\nelectromagnetic field in the Coulomb gauge is not affected\nby pure Lorentz boosts. Consequently, with R \u2261 R2 R1\nwe can write \u01eb\u0303\u03bcj = R\u03bc\u03bd \u01eb\u03bdj + i\u03b1j k \u03bc , or \u01eb\u0303j = R \u01eb\u03bdj + i\u03b1j k.\nIn addition, pure space rotations leave the field in both\nthe Coulomb and the Lorentz gauge (i.e., \u03b1j = 0). The\ntransformation law for the annihilation operator or the\nelectromagnetic field then becomes\nX\n\u00e2\u2032j (\u039bk) =\n\u01ebj * R \u01ebl \u00e2l (k) e\u2212i\u039bkl\nl\nX\n\n\u2261\n\nUjl \u00e2l (k) e\u2212i\u039bkl ,\n\n(11)\n\nl\n\nwith Ujl the 2 \u00d7 2 unitary matrix associated with the\noverall spatial rotation R.\nD.\n\nvj (k) d\u02c6\u2020j (k) e\u2212ikx\nd k X uj (k) b\u0302j (k) eikx\np\np\n+\n.\n2k0 j=1,2\n(2\u03c0)3 2k0\n(2\u03c0)3 2k0\n(12)\nHere, b\u0302j and d\u02c6\u2020j are the annihilation and creation operator of the fermion and the anti-fermion in spin state\nj \u2208 {1, 2}, respectively. The spinors uj (k) and vj (k) are\nfour-dimensional vectors with \u016bj \u2261 (\u03b3 0 uj )\u2020 = u\u2020j \u03b3 0 . The\nannihilation operator b\u0302j (k) is extracted using the following time-independent inner product:\nZ\n\u016bj (k)e\u2212ikx \u2194\nb\u0302j (k) = i d3 x p\n\u22020 \u03c8(x) .\n(13)\n(2\u03c0)3 2k0\nZ\n\nAgain, we write the spinor field in terms of Bob's coordinates and substitute this into the time-independent\ninner product. The transformed annihilation operator\nthus becomes\nX\nb\u0302\u2032j (\u039bk) \u221d\n\u016bj (\u039bk) ul (k) b\u0302l (k) e\u2212i\u039bkl\nl\n\nX\n\nDjl b\u0302l (k) e\u2212i\u039bkl ,\n\n(14)\n\nl\n\nwhere Djl is a 2 \u00d7 2 unitary matrix up to a non-unit determinant. This apparent loss of unitarity (det D 6= 1)\nis again due to the fact that the spatial integral in\nEq. (13) is not Lorentz invariant (three-volumes are not\npreserved), and we have to normalize D such that the determinant becomes one. Using det D = 21 [1 \u2212 k\u03bd \u039b\u03bd \u03bc k \u03bc ],\nthe Bogoliubov transformation for the spinor annihilation operator becomes\nb\u0302\u2032j (\u039bk) =\n\nX 2 \u016bj (\u039bk) ul (k)\nl\n\n1 \u2212 k\u03bd \u039b\u03bd \u03bc k \u03bc\n\nb\u0302l (k) e\u2212i\u039bkl .\n\n(15)\n\nThe Bogoliubov transformation for d\u02c6\u2032j (k \u2032 ) can be derived\nalong the same lines. Furthermore, it is easily verified\nthat the fermionic anti-commutation relations are unaltered by Lorentz transformations.\nThe spinors obey the orthogonality relations\n\u016bj (k) ul (k) = \u2212v\u0304j (k) vl (k) = \u03b4jl , and\nr\n\u0011T\nE+m \u0010\nkx +iky\nkz\nu1 (k) =\n,\n1 0 E+m\nE+m\nr 2m \u0010\n\u0011T\nE+m\nkx \u2212iky\n\u2212kz\nu2 (k) =\n.

In this representation it is straightforward to calculate the matrix elements \u016bj (\u039bk) ul (k).\n\nSpinor fields\n\nThe spinor field \u03c8(x) obeys the Dirac equation (i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212\nm) \u03c8 = 0, where m is the mass of the fermion. We use the\ngamma matrices \u03b3 \u03bc in the standard representation such\nthat \u03b3 0 = diag(1, 1, \u22121, \u22121). The plane-wave solutions\nto the Dirac equation can then be written as\n\u03c8(x) =\n\n\u2261\n\nIV. BOSONIC AND FERMIONIC\nMULTI-PARTICLE INTERFEROMETRY\n\nAs was argued in the introduction, two identical singleparticle plane waves incident on a beam splitter will result in bunching (bosons) or anti-bunching (fermions) in\nparticle detectors in the outgoing modes of the beam\nsplitter. In the boosted reference frame, these waves will\nin general no longer be identical, and as a result one\nwould expect deviations in the statistics of the detectors. The resolution of this paradox, both for photons\nand electrons, will naturally lead to a unified description\nof multi-particle boson and fermion interferometry.\nA.\n\nTwin-photon paradox\n\nFirst, consider the twin-photon paradox. The transformation law in Eq. (11) indicates that there is no polarization rotation associated with pure boosts. Therefore, let\nthe boosted annihilation operator be given by \u00e2\u2032 (\u039bk) =\n\u00e2(k), where we have chosen l = 0. The boosted singlephoton waves can then be written as \u00e2\u2020 (\u039bk1 )\u00e2\u2020 (\u039bk2 )|0i.\nIt is clear that the frequency components of \u039bk1 and\n\u039bk2 will generally be different. However, in the boosted\nframe, the beam splitter action will also change: We can\nwrite the interaction Hamiltonian of the beam splitter at\n\n\f5\nrest with incoming modes k1 and k2 as the bilinear form\nH=\n\n\u0003\n\u03c0i \u0002 \u2020\n\u00e2 (k1 ) \u00e2(k2 ) \u2212 \u00e2(k1 ) \u00e2\u2020 (k2 ) .\n2\n\n(17)\n\nIn the boosted frame, this Hamiltonian will become\ni\n\u03c0i h \u2032 \u2020\n\u2020\nH\u2032 =\n\u00e2 (\u039bk1 ) \u00e2\u2032 (\u039bk2 ) \u2212 \u00e2\u2032 (\u039bk1 ) \u00e2\u2032 (\u039bk2 ) .\n2\n\nThe linear Bogoliubov transformation corresponding to\nthe beam splitter action in the boosted frame is then\ngiven by exp(iH \u2032 ) \u00e2\u2032 (\u039bki ) exp(\u2212iH \u2032 ). Using the BakerCampbell-Hausdorff relation\ne\u03bbA Be\u2212\u03bbA = B + \u03bb[A, B] +\n\n\u03bb2\n[A, [A, B]] + . . . ,\n2\n\n(18)\n\nIn other words, the boosted beam splitter induces an interaction between different frequencies of the incoming\nfield. The beam splitter thus defines a preferred frame\nof reference in which identical photons exhibit the HongOu-Mandel effect. This resolves the twin-photon paradox.\nB.\n\n|\u03c8i =\n\nX\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\n2 \u2032\nDjl\nb\u0302 l (\u039bk1 ) b\u0302\u2032 l (\u039bk2 )|0i .\n\n(19)\n\nl\n\nIn other words, the fermions always occupy different spatial modes, and they have the same (boosted) spin. Note\nthat it is not the details of D that resolve the paradox,\nbut the canonical commutation relations. This mechanism is indicative of other massive quantum fields as\nwell: the paradox for massive bosons is resolved by invoking the bosonic commutation relations.\n\nC.\n\nwe find that the boosted beam splitter transformation\nbecomes\n1\n\u00e2(\u039bk1 ) \u2192 \u221a (\u00e2\u2032 (\u039bk1 ) \u2212 \u00e2\u2032 (\u039bk2 ))\n2\n1\n\u00e2(\u039bk2 ) \u2192 \u221a (\u00e2\u2032 (\u039bk1 ) + \u00e2\u2032 (\u039bk2 )) .\n2\n\nThe fermionic anti-commutation relations render the last\ntwo sums zero. In the boosted frame, the state is then\n\nNon-inertial movement and quantum\ninterferometry\n\nIt should be stressed that the resolution of the twinparticle paradox, as sketched above, is valid only for inertial observers. In other words, when Alice and Bob are\nin non-inertial motion with respect to each other, they\ngenerally cannot agree upon a shared vacuum state. As a\nconsequence, Alice and Bob no longer agree on the number of particles that are involved in the experiment. In\nphysical terms, when Alice prepares the experiment to\ndemonstrate the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, Bob will see a\nbeam splitter that emits thermal radiation. The energy\nof this radiation will be supplied by the mechanism that\ndrives the beam splitter away from inertial motion (according to Bob).\n\nTwin-electron paradox\n1.\n\nBosons\n\nThe fermionic beam splitter is in many ways the dual of\nthe bosonic case: When two identical fermions enter the\ntwo input ports of a fermionic beam splitter, the exclusion principle dictates that they will never leave the same\noutput port. In the boosted frame, however, both the\nwavelength and the spins of the fermions change. Naively,\nthis again results in a way of distinguishing the particles,\nwith a change in detector statistics as a result.\nThe resolution of this paradox is similar to that of the\ntwin-photon paradox: we need to transform the interaction Hamiltonian of the fermionic beam splitter. In addition, we need to show that the spin rotation does not\nactually render the particles distinguishable. Due to the\nfermionic anti-commutation relation {b\u0302j (k1 ), b\u0302l (k2 )} = 0,\na 50:50 electron beam splitter transforms the input state\nb\u0302\u2020j (k1 ) b\u0302\u2020j (k2 )|0i into itself. In the boosted frame, the\ntransformation becomes\nX\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n2 \u2032\u2020\nb\u0302\u2032 j (\u039bk1 ) b\u0302\u2032 j (\u039bk2 ) \u2192\nb\u0302 l (\u039bk1 ) b\u0302\u2032 l (\u039bk2 )\nDjl\n\nwith T00 the Hamiltonian density component of the stress\ntensor T , and\nZ\nZ\ndk\ndk\n(fk \u00e2k + fk\u2217 \u00e2\u2020k ) =\n(gk b\u0302k + gk\u2217 b\u0302\u2020k ).\n\u03c6=\n2k0\n2k0\n\nl6=m\n\nHere fk and gk are orthonormal mode functions corresponding to ladder operators \u00e2k \u2261 \u00e2(k) and b\u0302k \u2261 b\u0302(k), respectively, and (fj , fk ) = \u2212(fj\u2217 , fk\u2217 ) = \u03b4jk and (fj\u2217 , fk ) =\n0. Furthermore, we can write the annihilation operator\n\nl\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\n1X\nDjl Djm b\u0302\u2032 l (\u039bk1 ) b\u0302\u2032 m (\u039bk1 )\n2\nl6=m\n\u2020\n\u2020\n1X\nDjl Djm b\u0302\u2032 l (\u039bk2 ) b\u0302\u2032 m (\u039bk2 ).\n\u2212\n2\n\n+\n\nNevertheless, the transformation properties of the field\noperators allow a Hamiltonian formulation of multiparticle quantum interferometry for non-inertial observers. We will sketch a proof that the Hamiltonian of\na linear interferometer (including squeezing) is properly\ntransformed by substituting the Bogoliubov transformation of the creation and annihilation operators. We use\nthe fact that the Hamiltonian of a free (scalar) field \u03c6\ncan be written as\nZ\n1\nH = d3 x T00 = (i\u22020 \u03c6, \u03c6),\n2\n\n\f6\nin terms of the inner products of the mode functions and\nthe transformed creation and annihilation operators:\nZ\ndk\n\u00e2k =\n[(gj , fk )b\u0302j \u2212 (fk\u2217 , gj )b\u0302\u2020j ].\n(20)\n2k0\nSubstituting this transformation rule into H(\u00e2, \u00e2\u2020 ) and\nusing the completeness relation\nZ\n(\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) = dk[(\u03c61 , fk )(fk , \u03c62 ) \u2212 (\u03c61 , fk\u2217 )(fk\u2217 , \u03c62 )]\nyields the transformed Hamiltonian H(b\u0302, b\u0302\u2020 ).\nIn order to find the relativistic extension to linear\nmulti-particle quantum interferometry, we generalize this\nresult to any N -mode bilinear form of the interferometer's interaction Hamiltonian\nH=\n\nN\n\u0011\n1 X \u0010 \u2020\n\u00e2j Ajk \u00e2\u2020k + 2\u00e2\u2020j Bjk \u00e2k + \u00e2j Ajk \u00e2k ,\n2\n\n(21)\n\nj,k=1\n\nwhere A and B are symmetric N \u00d7 N Hermitian matrices. They give a complete description of N -mode multiparticle interferometry, including multi-mode squeezing\n(particle creation). Such Hamiltonians yield linear Bogoliubov transformations of the annihilation operators.\nIt follows from Eq. (3) that any arbitrary coordinate\ntransformation of the quantum fields (including noninertial transformations) also gives a Bogoliubov transformation of the annihilation and creation operators, and\nas a result preserves the structure of this Hamiltonian.\nSo far, we have derived the relativistic generalization of\nmulti-particle interferometry for scalar fields. Optical interferometry requires that we take into account the extra gauge freedom of the electromagnetic field. General\ncoordinate transformations will induce a nontrivial polarization rotation. It is easy to see, however, that the\nresulting Bogoliubov transformations allow for a similar\nrelativistic extension.\nThere is, however, one subtlety: When non-inertial\nobservers are involved, the parties in question typically\ndo not have access to all the modes in the Hamiltonian. Some modes will be causally separated by (effective) event horizons. Consequently, the field amplitudes\nof these modes have to be traced out, and the observers\nwill find that the output of the interferometer is in a\nmixed state.\n2.\n\nanti-electrons (denoted by b and d, respectively). From\nthe expansion of the spinor field in Eq. (12) we see that\ngeneral Bogoliubov transformations have the form\nb\u0302j \u2192\nd\u02c6\u2020j \u2192\n\nX\n\nk\nX\n\nUjk b\u0302k + Vjk d\u02c6\u2020k ,\nWjk d\u02c6\u2020k + Zjk b\u0302k ,\n\n(22)\n\nk\n\nwith U , V , W , and Z determined by the coordinate transformation. The bilinear interaction Hamiltonian of the\nfree spinor field must be closed under these transformations. To this end, we define the 2N -tuple of creation and\nannihilation operators ~s \u2261 (b\u03021 , . . . , b\u0302N , d\u02c6\u20201 , . . . , d\u02c6\u2020N ).

This constitutes a unified theory of\nrelativistic multi-particle fermionic interferometry.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, we have derived the explicit form of the\nannihilation operator of some common quantum fields\nunder relativistic transformations. Our results are completely general and offer a straightforward and fundamental way to calculate relativistic effects in bosonic and\nfermionic interferometers, thus establishing a unified theory of relativistic multi-particle quantum interferometry\nand linear optical quantum computing. With this theory, we can describe the behavior of multi-particle wave\npackets rather than momentum eigenstates in a direct\nmanner. Most notably, our technique can be applied to\narbitrary coordinate transformations, and can be used to\nstudy entanglement and relativistic quantum information\ntheory in arbitrary coordinate systems.\n\nFermions\n\nWe can generalize the fermionic beam splitter to arbitrary N -mode fermionic interferometers in a similar\nway. To include the spin- 12 degree of freedom, we assume M spatial modes, such that N = 2M . Furthermore, each mode can be occupied by both electrons and\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nP.K. is supported by the European Union RAMBOQ\nproject, and S.L.B. currently holds a Royal SocietyWolfson research merit award.\n\n\f7\n\n[1] A.
