Introduction\nThe precise knowledge of atomic radiative lifetimes is a prerequisite for many problems of modern\nquantum physics. First of all, their measurement often represents an accurate check for ab initio\ncalculations of atomic structure [1, 2, 3]: indeed, their computed values are much more sensitive\nto the details of the electronic wave functions than the computed total energy. The reliability of\nsuch calculations is essential when atoms are used for the investigation of fundamental problems,\nlike the search for parity non-conservation effects which are predicted by theories beyond the\nStandard Model. Up to now, the strongest constraint on the magnitude of such effects is provided\nby experiments with cesium [4, 5, 6] for parity violation, or with thallium atoms [7] for timereversal symmetry violation which would manifest itself by a permanent electric dipole moment\nof the electron.\nAmong all atomic species, the alkali atoms are systems of choice for comparative experimental\nand theoretical studies: their main resonant transition 2 S \u21922 P lies in the optical domain, while\ncalculations are facilitated by their simple electronic structure. At the 5th ASOS conference in\nMeudon (France) in 1995, U. Volz and H. Schmoranzer presented a review on measurements\nand calculations of alkali atom radiative lifetimes, as well as a series of updated precision\nmeasurements of the radiative lifetimes for Li, Na, K, and Rb atoms using beam-gas-laser\nspectroscopy [8]. In particular, they solved a long-standing discrepancy between ab-initio\ncalculations and measurements for lithium and sodium. In their paper, they refered to the\nfirst measurement of a radiative lifetime using the emerging technique of photoassociative\nspectroscopy (PAS) on ultracold lithium atoms [9]. Their result was in good agreement with\nthe PAS one, while the error bar derived with the PAS technique was claimed to be four times\nsmaller than their own.\n\n\fMore than a decade later, and motivated by our recent work on the radiative lifetime of atomic\ncesium [10], we take the opportunity offered by the edition of the special issue of Physica Scripta\nfor the 9th ASOS conference, to review the status and the accuracy of the PAS approach for\ndetermining the radiative lifetimes of alkali atoms, and more generally of atomic species which\nare nowadays laser-cooled and trapped. In Section 2, we briefly describe the photoassociation\nprocess which allows the investigation of the long-range interaction within a pair of cold atoms,\nfocussing on its link with the energy-level spacing of the atom pair through the so-called LeRoyBernstein law, and with the atomic radiative lifetime. Next (Section 3) we focus on a specific\nclass of electronic states of the atom pair - the so-called \"pure long-range\" states - which are\nparticularly relevant for the extraction of Na [11], K [12], Rb [13, 14] and Cs [15, 10] radiative\nlifetimes from PAS of these unusual molecular states. The case of molecular states which are\nnot of the pure long-range class is described in Section 4. Two different methods have been\nused to derive accurate radiative atomic lifetimes from PAS performed in cold samples: a direct\napplication of the LeRoy-Bernstein asymptotic law has been used in the cases of Sr [16] and\nYb [17]; a global fit of the full molecular potential at both short and large distances has been\nperformed to extract the radiative lifetimes for Li [18], Ca [19] and Sr [20] atoms. The last\nsection is devoted to the sensitive issue of the evaluation of the accuracy of the results for the\nvarious species obtained by PAS, which is generally claimed to be better than the one obtained\nfrom standard atomic physics techniques.\n2. Photoassociation of cold atoms, photoassociation spectroscopy and long-range\ninteractions\n2.1. Basics of photoassociation process\nPhotoassociation (PA) in atomic vapors is a well-known process [21, 22, 23, 24]: a pair of atoms\n(M,M') absorbs a photon of suitable energy h\u03bdP A , generally red-detuned from the energy of an\natomic transition h\u03bd0 , to create molecules in rovibrational levels of an excited electronic state\naccording to the reaction: M + M \u2032 + h\u03bdP A \u2192 (M M \u2032 )\u2217 . At room temperature, the PA process\nis not selective in the final state, due to the width of the Maxwell-Boltzmann kinetic energy\ndistribution of the atoms, which is most often larger than the energy gap between consecutive\nmolecular levels. Shortly after the first experimental observations of laser-cooling of atoms,\nThorsheim et al [25] proposed to perform photoassociation of ultracold atoms: as the width of\nthe kinetic energy distribution of the cold atoms is comparable or even smaller than the natural\nwidth of the excited state, the free-bound PA process allows a selective excitation of the initial\natom pair into an excited molecular state, just like a bound-bound process would do. Then\nit is possible to reach rovibrational levels with large spatial extension and with small binding\nenergy (Figure 1). PA has been observed a few years later on cold sodium [26] and rubidium [27]\nsamples, and became soon a fantastic tool for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy, referred\nto as photoassociation spectroscopy (PAS) [28]. The recent review by Jones et al [29] yields a\ncomprehensive study of PAS, and addresses one of the main issues of PA which is particularly\nrelevant for the present paper: \"PA favors the study of physicists' molecules, i.e., molecules\nwhose properties can be related (with high precision) to the properties of the constituent atoms.\".\n\n2.2. Long-range resonant dipole behavior\nAll the experiments reviewed here follow the general scheme of Figure 1. A pair of identical\natoms in their ground state (either ns 2 S1/2 or ns2 1 S0 for alkali or alkaline-earth-like elements,\nrespectively) is excited into a molecular state connected to the lowest (ns 2 S1/2 +np 2 P1/2,3/2 )\nor (ns2 1 S0 +nsnp 1 P01 ) dissociation limit. In all these cases, the asymptotic interaction between\n\n\f(a)\n\nTL\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\nCM\n\nPA\n\n50\n\nTL\n\n100 0\n\nPA\n\n50\n\nR (in units of a0)\n\n100\n\nR (in units of a0)\n\nFigure 1. General scheme of the photoassociation of a pair of cold atoms in their S ground state. In panel (a),\nthe atoms interact through a molecular potential curve, with a van der Waals character at large R, i.e., varying\nas R\u22126 . As their relative initial kinetic energy is very small, the radial wave function has a large amplitude at\nlarge distances, so that in a classical vision, the atom pair likely absorbs a photon with a frequency red-detuned\nfrom the atomic S \u2192 P transition frequency (arrow labelled PA). Bound levels with a small binding energy and a\nlarge spatial extension are efficiently populated. Most of the relative vibrational motion then takes place at large\nR, where the excited interaction potential behaves as R\u22123 . This bound level can either decay back to a pair of\nfree atoms which escape from the cold atom trap (arrow TL, for trap loss), or to a bound level of the molecular\nground state, creating then a cold molecule (arrow CM, for cold molecule). Panel (b) illustrates the same process\nfor an excited double-well potential like, for instance, in cesium photoassociation.\nthe atoms is dominated by the resonant dipole interaction and is approximated by\nV (R) = D \u2212\n\nC3\n,\nR3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D is the dissociation energy of the interaction potential. The coefficient C3 depends on\nthe relative orientation of the atomic dipoles with respect to the molecular axis and is thus\ndifferent for a \u03a3 or a \u03a0 molecular state. It corresponds to the exchange of excitation between\nthe two atoms and it is simply related to a characteristic of the atom, the atomic dipole matrix\nelement. One has\nC3\u03a3 = \u22122C3\u03a0 = \u22122\n\nR2\n,\n3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere R =< ns|r|np > is the radial integral of the dipole length operator between the atomic\nns and np orbitals. The C3 coefficients are therefore related to the atomic radiative lifetime of\nthe P level since\n\u03c4=\n\n9h\u0304\u03bb3\n,\n32\u03c0 3 R2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the considered S \u2192 P atomic transition.\nEquation (1) is always an approximation, only valid for very large interatomic distances.\nSeveral other effects are likely to contribute to the interaction energy:\n\n\f\u2022 the following terms Cn /Rn with n=6, 8, 10, .... of the multipole expansion: they account\nfor polarization and dispersion forces;\n\u2022 the spin-orbit interaction: it has to be taken into account for alkali atoms, but not for\nalkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like ones, due to the choice of the excited state;\n\u2022 the hyperfine structure of the ground state: for alkali atoms, the hyperfine splitting of the\nexcited atomic state increases with atomic mass; it is almost negligible at the experimental\nprecision of PAS for lithium but not for cesium; the lack of the hyperfine structure for the\nchosen isotopes of the other elements considered here, Ca, Sr and Yb, simplifies the analysis\nof the experiments;\n\u2022 the rotation of the molecule: it is often absent in the initial colliding state, when the\ntemperature of the atom cloud is low enough (s-wave collisions); however it has always\nto be accounted for in the excited molecular state. The rotational energy E rot (v, J) of a\nrovibrational level (v, J) can be estimated by the diagonal part of the rotational Hamiltonian\nH rot =\n\nJ2 \u2212 2J.j + j2\n,\n2\u03bcR2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere J and j are, respectively, the total angular momentum and the total electronic angular\nmomentum of the considered dimer and \u03bc its reduced mass;\n\u2022 the overlap between the two electron clouds: it is manifested by an exchange energy which\nvanishes exponentially with increasing atomic distances [30, 31]. For the excited states of\nthe alkali dimers that we consider here, it depends essentially on a single parameter which\nis the product of the amplitudes of the atomic ns and np wavefunctions. The derivation\n\u03a3,\u03a0\n, is recalled in\nof the relevant expressions of the \u03a3 and \u03a0 asymptotic exchange terms, Vexch\nRef [15];\n\u2022 the retardation effect, related to the Casimir-Polder effect in London-van der Waals\ninteraction [32]: when accounting for the finite velocity of light, the long-range interaction\nbetween the atoms is modified. This effect is usually small but clearly noticeable in several\nexperiments reviewed here. Following Refs [33, 34], it can be accounted for simply, by\nmultiplying the C3 coefficient by a correcting term which is different for \u03a0 and \u03a3 states:\n2\u03c0R\n2\u03c0R\n2\u03c0R 2\n2\u03c0R\n2\u03c0R\n)+(\n) sin (\n)\u2212(\n) cos (\n)\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n2\u03c0R\n2\u03c0R\n2\u03c0R\n)+(\n) sin (\n);\nf \u03a3 (R) = cos (\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\nf \u03a0 (R) = cos (\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n\u2022 the intra-atomic relativistic effects: they tend to contract differently the atomic p1/2 and\np3/2 orbitals [35]. It is possible to account for these effects through a small parameter \u01eb,\nwhich characterizes the ratio between the dipole matrix elements corresponding to the two\np orbitals\n2\u03c41/2 \u0010 \u03bb3/2 \u00113\n< ns|r|np3/2 >2\n2\n=\n=\n.\n2\n< ns|r|np1/2 >\n\u03c43/2 \u03bb1/2\n(1 + \u01eb)2\n\n(7)\n\nMore details can be found in rubidium [14] and cesium [15, 10] studies;\n\u2022 the non-adiabatic terms negelected in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which assumes\nfixed nuclei of infinite mass: it is possible [36] to release this assumption while still\nmaintaining the decoupling of nuclear and electronic motions, by considering the diagonal\ncorrections for the motion of the nuclei. The description of these terms can be found in Ref\n[18];\n\n\f\u2022 the specific shift and broadening of the PA lines due to the temperature of the atomic cloud:\nthese effects depend also on the shapes of the ground and excited molecular potentials. They\nare discussed in great detail in the calcium study [19];\n\u2022 the so-called predissociation process: it is due to the interaction of the molecular state with\nthe continuum of a neighboring one and it gives rise to line broadening. This problem arose\nin particular in the ytterbium study [17].\n2.3. LeRoy-Bernstein law and energy spacing of high-lying vibrational states\nAssuming that the asymptotic form of the molecular potential is written as\nV (R) = D \u2212\n\nCn\n,\nRn\n\n(8)\n\none can show, using a semi-classical Wigner-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) description of the\nvibrational wavefunction, that the energy Ev of a molecular vibrational level is related to its\nvibrational quantum number v through the so-called LeRoy-Bernstein law [37]:\n(D \u2212 Ev ) = [Xn (vD \u2212 v)](2n/n\u22122)\nr\n\nXn = h\u0304\n\n\u03c0 (n \u2212 2)\u0393(1 + 1/n) \u22121/n\nCn .\n2\u03bc\n\u0393(1/2 + 1/n)\n\n(9)\n\nIn Equation (9), \u0393(z) is an Euler Gamma function and vD is a non-integer number (the noninteger value that v would take at the dissociation limit D) which is related to the phase\naccumulated by the wavefunction over its whole spatial extension, including the short-range\npart of the potential. In the case of a R\u22123 potential, Equation (9) becomes\n(D \u2212 Ev ) = X0 (vD \u2212 v)6 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwith\nX0 = (X3 )6 =\n\nh h\u03042 i3 h \u0393(4/3) i6 pi3\n\n2\u03bc\n\n\u0393(5/6)\n\n(C3 )2\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nAs the total number of vibrational levels of the potential is most often not known, it is convenient,\ninstead of labeling the levels by a number v starting from the v = 0 lowest vibrational level, to\ncharacterize them by v \u2217 starting from the v \u2217 = 1 uppermost one.

Pure long-range states: molecules as atom pairs\nFor Na2 , K2 , Rb2 and Cs2 dimers, the molecular state of 0\u2212\ng symmetry converging toward the\nfirst (ns + np3/2 ) limit is a \"pure long-range\" state according to the definition of Ref [38]. It\nhas a double-well potential, for which the most external well is shallow and entirely located at\nunusually large internuclear separations. Each atom keeps somehow its identity and the molecule\nlooks more like a pair of atoms. The electron cloud overlap is unimportant, so that the potential\nis completely determined by long-range interatomic forces and atomic spin-orbit splitting, and\ncan thus be calculated with high precision. We emphasize here that this situation is very different\nfrom the one encountered with usual molecular potentials, for which the knowledge of the inner\npart of the potential curve most often relies on quantum chemistry calculations, which never\nreach such a precision.\nThe dominant long-range interactions are the R\u22123 resonant dipole interaction and the spinorbit coupling [39]. For the 0\u2212\ng potentials, the simple analytical model introduced in [40] is the\n\u2212\nbasis of the analysis. Two 0g potentials arise from a mixing of two Hund's case (a) states, a\n\u2212\nrepulsive 3 \u03a0g state and an attractive 3 \u03a3+\ng one. The two adiabatic 0g potentials are obtained by\ndiagonalizing the matrix of the interaction in this basis of states,\n\u03a0\nVM P (R) =\n\nV\n\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a0 (R) \u2212 2\u2206\n3\n\u221a\n2\u2206\n3\n\n\u221a\n\nV\n\n2\u2206\n3\n\n\u03a3 (R) \u2212 \u2206\n3\n\n!\n\n\u03a0\n,\n\u03a3\n\n(15)\n\nwith\n\u03a0/\u03a3\n\nV\n\n\u03a0/\u03a3\n\n\u03a0/\u03a3\n\nP i/\u03a3\n\nC\nC\nC\n(R) = \u2212 3 3 f \u03a0/\u03a3 (R) \u2212 6 6 \u2212 8 8\nR\nR\nR\n\n\u03a0/\u03a3\n\n+ Vexch ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the atomic spin-orbit splitting and the zero of energy is taken at the (ns + np3/2 )\nasymptote. The 0\u2212\ng potential in which we are interested is the upper adiabatic potential, which\nconverges to the (ns + np3/2 ) limit. As this state is a mixture with R-varying weights of two\nstates having different coefficients of the R\u22123 term, it is clear that one has an \"effective\" C3\nwhich varies with R and that the validity of the LeRoy-Bernstein law is limited by the mixing\nof states. The knowledge of the eigenvectors of the matrix of Eq.(15) allows one to evaluate the\ncorrections which involve the R-dependent mixing of states, like the j2 term of Equation (4),\nor which contain R-derivatives, like the non Born-Oppenheimer corrections. The determination\nof the parameters entering in the matrix of Eq.(15), where it is possible to add all the effects\npreviously described (see for instance [14]), yields an analytical expression for the 0\u2212\ng potential.\n3. Determination of the radiative lifetime of Na, K, Rb, Cs atoms from pure\nlong-range state analysis\nTable 1 summarizes the values of the atomic radiative lifetimes of the first excited np states of Na,\nK, Rb and Cs which have been obtained through photoassociation of laser cooled atoms in the\npure long-range 0\u2212\ng state of the corresponding dimer, together with other recent high-precision\nmeasurements using various methods.\nTable 2 displays the main characteristics of these different studies. Since the 0\u2212\ng potential\nis a pure long-range potential, one does not need to find a way to deal with an inner part of\nthe potential in order to avoid reducing the precision, as it would be the case for a \"normal\"\npotential. In all studies, the retardation effect has been introduced according to Equation\n(6). For light atoms retardation has been found impossible to ignore: PAS of the 0\u2212\ng state of\nNa2 provided the first reported evidence of such effects in molecular spectra and an estimation\nof the retardation contribution for different alkali dimers [11]. In the case of heavier atoms,\n\n\fthe effect is less important. For cesium, a fit without retardation yields parameters which\nare not significantly different from the ones of Ref [10], which included retardation. Besides\nresonant dipole and spin-orbit interaction, which are always the dominant terms, the terms of\nthe multipole development in R\u22126 and R\u22128 are introduced in all studies, but the corresponding\nparameters, or ratios between them are sometimes kept fixed to a theoretical value (see Table 2).\nThe R\u221210 term is generally negelected, except in Ref [13], where its influence is discussed. The\ninfluence of molecular rotation is accounted for in all studies, in the form given by Equation (4).\nSlightly different ways of dealing with the mixing of \u03a0 and \u03a3 states have been used, as we will see\nbelow. Asymptotic exchange interaction has to be introduced for the heavier elements, Rb and\nCs. The variation with R of the spin-orbit interaction was considered in Refs [14, 15]. Finally the\nvalidity of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is carefully investigated in the sodium study\n[11]. Hyperfine structure does not appear in PA spectra, except for very high-lying levels. As it\nis neither resolved in the experiments nor introduced in the models used for the lifetime value\nextraction, it constitutes an important limitation to the final precision of the determinations.\nTable 1. Determinations from photoassociation spectroscopy (PA) of the radiative lifetimes of the atomic\nnp2 P3/2 states of Na, K, Rb and Cs (in bold face), together with recent measurements by other methods.

Comparison of the determinations of atomic lifetimes from photoassociative spectroscopy of the 0\u2212\ng\nstates. The most important points are recalled, when available. Displayed here are: the estimated experimental\nuncertainty on the measured energy of the vibrational states (in MHz), \u03c3E ; the number of levels included in the\nfitting procedure, N ; the smallest and largest values of the external Condon points of these levels, RCmin and\nRCmax (1a0 =0.0529277 nm); the energy terms that were included in the asymptotic potential in the considered\nanalysis: non-Born-Oppenheimer (non-BO), exchange (exch.) or relativistic (rel.) terms; the \"effective\" number\nof free parameters included in the fit, p (i.e. the number of parameters of the model decreased by one each\ntime either a parameter or a ratio between two parameters is kept fixed); the \u03c72 value of the fit (eventually\nrecalculated to fit the definition of Equation (18)), when it is available; the estimated relative uncertainty of the\nnp3/2 radiative lifetime, \u03c3\u03c4 (in %), as given in the original reference. The values of RCmin correspond to the\nbottom of the external well. The value of RCmax noted \u2217 for Na has been calculated from the value of the binding\nenergy of the highest level included in the fit (similar data were not available for potassium); for Rb (resp. Cs),\nthe values of RCmax are deduced from the corresponding v value using [49] (resp.

Sodium\nThe 0\u2212\ng external well of Na2 is very shallow, with only 12 vibrational levels. The energies of\ntwo rotational levels (J = 2 and J = 4) for v values ranging from 0 to 7 were measured with an\nuncertainty of 5 MHz. The analysis of the data was made by starting from the model of Movre\nand Pichler [40] and by adding successively the most important corrections: retardation, R\u22126\nand R\u22128 terms, non-adiabatic diagonal corrections and rotation. In addition to the Bv J(J + 1)\nterm, corresponding to the J2 term of Equation (4), the authors calculated the j2 term by using\nthe previously calculated mixing of \u03a3 and \u03a0 states.\nThis progressive introduction of the energy terms allowed the authors to clearly point out\nthe role of the different corrections, in particular of the retardation effect: they were able\nto give an accurate estimation of the contribution of this effect to the well depth. They also\nperformed a complete coupled-channel calculation including all molecular potentials correlated to\nthe (3s + 3p) limit, which accounts for non Born-Oppenheimer effects. The long-range potentials\nwere smoothly connected at R = 35 a0 to ab initio calculations. This complete calculation shows\nthat the non Born-Oppenheimer effects are very small. The influence of the inner part of the\npotentials was found fully negligible (using a hard wall at 35 a0 gave almost no shift of the\nrelevant eigenenergies). A fit of the J = 2 results was made while keeping constant the two C8\ncoefficients (using the values of Ref [51]) and the ratio between the two C6 ones (using the same\nreference). \u00bfFrom the result of this fit, a value of the 3p atomic radiative lifetime was deduced,\nwhich is in good agreement with the result of fast beam measurements of Ref [8] and with two\nother recent experimental values, based on linewidth analysis and on molecular spectroscopy of\nlow-lying vibrational levels (see Table 1). It also agrees well with the theoretical result of Ref\n[1]. All these data have completely removed a long-standing discrepancy between experiment\nand theory (see [8]).\n\n\f3.2. Potassium\nA PAS study with ultracold potassium atoms was performed in 1997 [12], with a \"dark spot\"\nmagneto-optical trap. The vibrational levels of the pure long-range 0\u2212\ng potential converging to\nthe (4s + 4p3/2 ) limit have been observed between v = 0 and v = 30. The rotational component\nJ = 2 of most levels was measured with an uncertainty smaller than 60 MHz. The analysis\nis performed along the same lines as for sodium. The calculated rovibrational energies are\nfitted to 23 measured ones (v = 0 \u2212 12, 14 \u2212 17, 19 \u2212 22, 24, 26); the ratios between C6 and C8\ncoefficients are kept fixed to a theoretical value [51]. The one-\u03c3 standard deviation is 0.0013\ncm\u22121 . The uncertainty on the C3 value includes both a part coming from the fitting procedure\nand a systematic part coming from the limitations of the model, essentially from neglecting the\nmolecular hyperfine structure. The estimation of the final uncertainty is however not described\nin detail. The lifetime value agrees well with the measurement of Ref [8] (see Table 1).\n3.3. Rubidium\nThere are two independant studies [13, 14], using different experimental data.\nThe first experiment [13] used a FORT trap with a temperature of about 700 \u03bcK and doubly\nspin-polarized atoms. From photassociation spectra of both 85 Rb and 87 Rb atoms, a large\n85 Rb\nnumber of rovibrational energy levels of the 0\u2212\ng potential of both isotopes (v = 0 \u2212 40 for\nand v = 0 \u2212 24, 28 \u2212 35, 41 \u2212 47 for 87 Rb) were obtained with an uncertainty of the order of\n60 MHz. The diagonalization of the matrix of Equation (15) was done analytically on a simplified\nform of the matrix, before the addition of the correcting terms, some of them (non-adiabatic\nterms, rotation) depending on the mixing of states which is characterized by the eigenvectors\nof the diagonalization. The terms introduced are: retardation effect on the resonant dipole\ninteraction, dispersion terms up to R\u22128 , asymptotic exchange interaction, rotation (using the\nknown mixing of j = 0 and j = 2 states). Finally, the effect of R\u221210 terms and of non-adiabatic\ncorrections have been tested. A rather detailed study of these effects and of their influence on\nthe results of the fit procedure is given: we will comment on this point in the last section.\nThe other study [14] has been performed on the experimental data of Ref [52], concerning\nonly 87 Rb, in a MOT trap at about 120 \u03bcK. The analysis of the data is conducted in a similar\nway. The v values included in the fit were v = 0, 1, 12 \u2212 23, 30 \u2212 71. The diagonalization is done\nnumerically on the complete form of the two-state matrix given by Equation (15), including\nretardation effect on the resonant dipole interaction, dispersion terms up to R\u22128 , asymptotic\nexchange interaction, rotation, intra-atomic relativistic corrections and R-varying spin-orbit\nterms. Concerning rotation, the j2 term was simply calculated using the asymptotic value\nj = 2. The spin-orbit R-variation, which was suggested by quantum chemistry calculations,\nappeared to greatly diminish the agreement between experimental and calculated values. The\nestimation of the uncertainty on the lifetime value will also be discussed in the last section.\nThe lifetime values obtained from the two PAS studies are fully compatible, and in agreement\nwith most of the previous experimental determinations (see Table 1).\n3.4. Cesium\nIn the cesium case, the two published studies [15, 10] from our group concern the analysis of the\nsame PAS data from ref.[50], from which a Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) potential was previously\nextracted. Our second analysis [10] was necessary in order to solve remaining discrepancies in\nthe intensity of the PA spectrum and in the scattering length and the van der Waals ground\nstate C6 values that we deduced in Ref [53].\nThe 0\u2212\ng potential of Cs2 is not strictly speaking a pure long-range one: the minimum of\nthe external well is located around 25 a0 , whereas the LeRoy criterion which is generally\nused for the definition of long-range distances [54] yields a distance of about 28.5 a0 . It was\ntherefore unavoidable to introduce the asymptotic exchange term. The top of the potential\n\n\fbarrier separating the internal and external well is critically related to the exchange term and\nis expected to be close to the energy of the dissociation limit [55]. The imperfect knowledge of\nthe height of the barrier will affect the description of the highest levels, which were therefore\nnot introduced in the fit. Relativistic atomic corrections were introduced and, in the first paper,\nR-variation of the spin-orbit was also considered, like in Ref [14]. Both studies used exactly the\nsame model and the same least-square fitting code.\nThe main difference between the two cesium studies was the v-labeling of the observed levels:\nthe level numbered v = 0 in the first reference [15] was labeled v = 2 in the second one [10].\nThe change in the v labeling affected the shape of the bottom of the 0\u2212\ng potential (it is of\ncourse deeper, to admit two more levels), but its long-range part remained unchanged. As\na consequence, the two lifetime values are close to each other and both compatible with the\nmeasurement of Ref [47] rather than with the one of Ref [48] (see Table 1). However, we took\nthe opportunity of the second study to investigate more carefully the estimation of the error\nbars; taking then into account the correlations between the parameters, we found an uncertainty\nfor the lifetime value strikingly larger than in the previous study. We will come back to this\npoint in the last section.\n4. Determination of radiative lifetimes of Li, Ca, Sr, Yb atoms from long-range\nanalysis\nAs shown in Section 2.3, atomic interaction parameters can be obtained from a careful analysis of\nthe energy of the high-lying molecular levels. McAlexander et al. [9, 18] reported two studies of\n1 +\nthe A1 \u03a3+\nu potential of Li2 converging to the (2s+2p) limit while the B \u03a3u potentials converging\n2\n1\n1\nto the ((ns ) S0 + (nsnp) P1 ) limit have been investigated for Ca [19], Sr [20, 16] and Yb [17]\n(with n=3, 4 and 6 respectively).\nTable 3 shows the results obtained from PAS by different groups, together with recent atomic\nlifetime measurements obtained by other methods. Table 4 displays the main characteristics of\nthe PAS studies. The last two rows refer to LeRoy-Bernstein fits, in which only the R\u22123 term is\nincluded. It is emphasized here that the straightforward approach of directly fitting the data to\nthe LeRoy-Bernstein formula, although quite tempting for those new to the method, can lead\nto misleading data, even when the fit seems quite good. Modified forms of the LeRoy-Bernstein\nlaw, involving a larger number of parameters, are proposed in Ref [56, 57]. In the latter, the\nvalidity criteria are given in terms of the energy value, and not in terms of interatomic distance,\nas it is usually done. For the other cases, we indicate in the Table how the authors managed\nthe inner part of the potential. Rotation and retardation are always introduced in the manner\ndescribed in Section 2.2. Dispersion terms in R\u2212n with n = 6 are introduced in the Ca study,\nand with n=6, 8 in the Li study. Non Born-Oppenheimer effects are also included in the latter.\n4.1. Lithium\nFor lithium, the spin-orbit interaction between the attractive \u03a3 state and the repulsive \u03a0 state is\nmuch weaker than for the other alkalis and cannot compete with the resonant dipole interaction\nto give rise to a pure long-range potential well. In order to calculate vibrational energies and\nwavefunctions, the asymptotic part of the potential has to be completed by a description of its\ninner part. In the study of Ref [18], the A1 \u03a3+\nu potential curve was constructed using the RKR\npotential of Ref [59] for the inner part, and, for the outer part, using an analytic form of the\nlong-range interaction. The depth of the potential D is considered as an adjustable parameter.\nThe RKR potential is extrapolated at short distance with two ab initio points and is smoothly\nconnected, at about 25.4 a0 , to the long-range interaction, which includes the C3 /R3 , C6 /R6 and\nC8 /R8 terms of the multipole expansion and the first-order corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation. The retardation effects are introduced as in the previous section. The hyperfine\nstructure of the lines was calculated by first-order perturbation theory in order to precisely locate\n\n\fTable 3.

As claimed by McAlexander et al., the precision\nof their analysis was sensitive to non Born-Oppenheimer effects, to retardation effects and to\nrelativistic effects in atomic structure calculations.\n\n0.79\n\n\f4.2. Calcium\nThe experiment was performed with calcium atoms in a MOT at a temperature of about 1.5 mK\n[19]. The PAS lines corresponding to 8 rovibrational levels (J = 1, 3 and v \u2217 = 69, 72, 80, 85) of\n2 1\n1\nthe excited B 1 \u03a3+\nu potential converging to the ((4s ) S0 + (4s4p) P1 ) limit were observed and\nanalyzed, with a final experimental uncertainty for the level energies \u03c3E \u223c 10 MHz. In order\nto account for line shifts and broadening induced either by the finite temperature of the atom\ncloud or by the power of the PA laser, the atom trap loss was carefully modelled. The authors\nused the formalism of Bohn and Julienne [64], which yields the temperature dependence of the\nPA profile once both ground and excited potential are known. The ground state potential was\ntaken from Ref [65]. For the excited potential, they used an asymptotic part including resonant\ndipole interaction with retardation correction, R\u22126 and rotation terms\nV (R) = D \u2212\n\nC6\nh\u03042 [J(J + 1) + 2]\nC3 \u03a3\nf\n(R)\n\u2212\n+\n,\nR3\nR6\n2\u03bcR2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the rotation term is obtained from Equation (4), where the j = 1 value of the electronic\nangular momentum is taken into account. Instead of using a defined potential in the inner part,\nthe authors fixed boundary conditions near the frontier of the long-range region (R = 0.95 nm).\nThey imposed on the vibrational wavefunctions to vanish on a nodal line whose position was\ntaken as an adjustable parameter, according to the accumulated phase method of Refs [66, 67].\nThis method was checked to give the same results as the one in which the asymptotic part is\nconnected to an ab initio potential [68] with an adjustable repulsive wall. An iterative procedure\nwas used, since the parameters of the asymptotic potential required to analyze the profiles were\ndeduced from the result of this same analysis. The very precise (0.04 %) lifetime value that\nthey obtained for the atomic level 1 P1 is found in agreement with the value obtained by photon\ncounting [60], but not with the one based on the Hanle effect [61] (see Table 3). It agrees well\nwith the many-body calculations of Ref [2], but not so well with the quantum chemistry ones\n[69] or with the Multi-Configuration Hartree-Fock ones [3].\n4.3. Strontium\nTwo different groups reported measurements of PAS in cold strontium [20, 16]. Both were using\n88 Sr in a magneto-optical trap, but with rather different temperatures (see Table 3). In both\nexperiments only s-wave collisions are expected to occur so that only a single rotational level\nJ = 1 is excited.\nIn the first experiment [20], the energy of the vibrational levels with v \u2217 ranging from 48 to\n61 was claimed to be measured with an uncertainty \u03c3E of the order of 5 MHz. The analysis\nwas made by quantum calculations. The asymptotic behavior of the potential was given by\nEquation (17) (without the R\u22126 term) and was smoothly connected, at R = 1.5 nm, to an ab\ninitio potential [70]. The position of the inner wall was considered as an adjustable parameter.\nTheir best fit was characterized by \u03c72 = 0.79.\nThe second experiment [16] had a larger experimental uncertainty \u03c3E \u223c 300 MHz. The\nmeasurements concerned levels with v \u2217 = 84 \u2212 134, 150 \u2212 160 and the analysis was made using\nLeRoy-Bernstein law.\nThe two results are not strictly speaking compatible (the gap between the two confidence\nintervals is larger than the error bar of the second reference). Neither result agrees with previous\nmeasurements (see Table 3); the agreement is better with calculations of Ref [2].\n4.4. Ytterbium\nYtterbium is a rare-earth element with electronic structure in the ground state 4f 14 6s2 similar\nto the one of alkaline-eath atoms. The atoms were prepared in a FORT trap at a temperature\n\n\fof about 100 \u03bcK [17]. About 72 levels (J = 1 and v \u2217 = 103 \u2212 174) were measured and assigned\n1\n1\nto the 1 \u03a3+\nu potential converging to the ( S0 + P1 ) limit. The analysis was made using the\nLeRoy-Bernstein law. Rotation is expected to be extremely weak and was not introduced. The\nresiduals of the fit are less than 0.5 %. The influence of the neglected effects is estimated and the\nmain limitation of the precision is claimed to be the line broadening due to predissociation. The\nextremely precise value which is obtained is in agreement with most of the much less accurate\nprevious measurements.\n5. Discussion of accuracy issues\nThe key advantage of determining atomic lifetimes from photoassociative spectroscopy is that\ntheir values are deduced from high resolution molecular spectroscopy. However, transmitting\nthis precision to the atomic radiative lifetime value is not a trivial matter. In the following, we\ndescribe in detail how the quality or the \"goodness\" of the fit and the confidence interval of the\noptimized parameters should be properly investigated. We illustrate our derivation through a\nnumerical application within a linear approximation applied to some of the experiments reported\nin the previous section.\n5.1. Accuracy of a parameter determination from a fit procedure\nThe quality of the fit is primarily characterized by the minimum value of the least-square \u03c72\nfunction\n2\n\n\u03c7 =\n\nP\n\n\u2212 Eexp )2\n,\n2\n(N \u2212 p)\u03c3E\n\ni=1,N (Ecalc\n\n(18)\n\nwhich should be close to one, or by the rms value,\nrms =\n\nsP\n\n\u2212 Eexp )2\n,\n(N \u2212 p)\n\ni=1,N (Ecalc\n\n(19)\n\nwhich has the dimension of an energy and has to be close to \u03c3E . It is worth mentioning that\nthe estimate of the uncertainty on the measurements is most generally not well known: one\noften uses the results of the fit to define an \"unbiased\" value of this error. One can get further\ninformation on the quality of the fit by analyzing the residuals (see for instance [71]). When the\ndata have a natural order, like it is the case here, the non-stochastic trend of their distribution\ncan be checked visually, or by a more elaborate method. We tried the method of Ref [71] as an\na posteriori test for the residuals of our cesium study [10]: the frequency of sign changes was\nfound to be 0.3286, whereas the ideal value corresponding to p = 6 free parameters was 0.5269\nwith a variance of 0.05917. According to this criterion, our fit was therefore not completely\nsatisfying. This was indeed qualitatively visible in a graph of the ordered distribution of the\nresiduals (not shown in our paper).\nOnce the fit has been checked to be unbiased, one has to evaluate the error bars on the\nparameter values. In all cases of interest here, the least-mean square function \u03c72 is a complicated\nnon-linear function of the different parameters. However, close to the best fit region, it is\noften possible to linearize the model, i.e. to consider that the calculated energies Ev depend\napproximately linearly on the parameters (see Ref [72] and references therein, in particular Ref\n[73]). Let us call X the N \u00d7 p matrix of the derivatives of the N calculated Ev values with\nrespect to the p parameters ai , with\nXv,i =\n\n\u2202Ev\n.\n\u2202ai\n\n(20)\n\n\fThe theory of linear regression can then be used, with the X matrix playing the role of the model\nmatrix M which relates the calculated energies to the parameters through the vector equation\nE = Ma, where E is the N -dimensional vector of the Ev values and a the p-dimensional vector of\nthe parameters. In particular the square of the one-parameter standard errors are the diagonal\nmatrix elements of the p \u00d7 p covariance matrix V,\n2\nV = \u03c3E\n(XT X)\u22121 .\n\n(21)\n\nwhere XT is the transpose of the matrix X. The great interest of such a treatment is that it\naccounts for the correlations between the parameters.\nIt is also possible to consider the case where only a part of the parameters of the model\nare optimized whereas some others are fixed to a value with a known uncertainty (see the PhD\nthesis of Nicolas Vanhaecke [72]). Let be a\u2217 (resp. \u00e3\u2217 ) the vector of the optimized (resp. nonoptimized) parameters at the minimum of \u03c72 . The values of the optimized parameters are\nexpected to change if the values of the non-optimized ones are taken at a value \u00e3 different from\n\u00e3\u2217 . Within the linear approximation, the value of the optimized parameters can be calculated\nwithout performing a new fit, according to\nh\n\ni\n\na = a\u2217 + (XT X)\u22121 XT e \u2212 X\u0303(\u00e3 \u2212 \u00e3\u2217 ) ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere e is the vector of the residuals. It is possible to evaluate the error made on a given\n(adjusted) parameter value due to the uncertainty of the other (fixed) parameter. We call X\n(resp. X\u0303) the matrices of derivatives for the optimized (resp. non-optimized) parameters taken\nseparately, and V the covariance matrix of the optimized parameters, according to Equation (21).\nBy analogy, we call \u1e7c the matrix whose diagonal elements are the square of the uncertainties\nof the non-optimized parameters. The restriction to the optimized parameters of the total\ncovarance matrix can be written as\nVt = V + (XT X)\u22121 XT X\u0303\u1e7cX\u0303T X(XT X)\u22121 .\n\n(23)\n\nIf the model is not close enough to a linear one, the most direct way to account for the\ncorrelations between the parameters is to draw \u03c72 contours, corresponding to the minimum\n\u03c72 values obtained by varying step by step one particular parameter while letting all other free.\nDifferent conditions, based for instance either on the Fisher distribution with p and N \u2212p degrees\nof freedom or on the so called \u03c72 law (also called Pearson law with N \u2212 p degrees of freedom)\nallow one to find conditions for the \u03c72 values defining the confidence ellipsoid corresponding to\nthe chosen parameter (see for instance Ref [73]).\n5.2. The LeRoy-Bernstein law\nWe first consider the case of the strontium study [16] and of the ytterbium study [17], where the\ndata are fitted to the LeRoy-Bernstein (LR-B) law with two parameters, C3 and vD . We will\nassume here that the model can be linearized.\nThe goodness of the fit can be checked by analysing the residuals (see for instance Ref [71]).\nIn the LR-B study of strontium [16], a qualitative check of the residuals is possible and seems\nto be satisfying, if one assumes that the experimental uncertainty \u03c3E is constant. It is more\ndifficult to conclude this in the case of the LR-B study of Ytterbium [17]; the residuals are not\nshown and the authors claim that the deviations are everywhere smaller than 0.5%. This might\nhowever imply much larger deviations for low lying levels, which are still probably measured\nwith the same or higher precision (in absolute value): this could be the signature of a deviation\nfrom LR-B law for these levels.\n\n\fWriting the LeRoy-Bernstein law in the simple form of Equation (12), one finds that the\nmatrix elements of H = XT X are\nv\u2217\n\nH11 =\n\nb\nX\n\n\u2217 12\n(v \u2217 \u2212 vD\n)\n\n(24)\n\nv\u2217 =va\u2217\n\nH12 = H21 = \u22126X0\n\nv\u2217\n\nb\nX\n\n\u2217 11\n(v \u2217 \u2212 vD\n)\n\nv\u2217 =va\u2217\nvb\u2217\n\nH22 = 36(X0 )2\n\nX\n\n\u2217 10\n(v \u2217 \u2212 vD\n) ,\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\nv\u2217 =va\u2217\n\nwhere va\u2217 and vb\u2217 are the limits of the v \u2217 -values introduced in the fit (it is assumed in the\nabove formulas that the v \u2217 values are contiguous, but it is straightforward to extend them to\nany set of v \u2217 values). Assuming that the least mean square function is locally linear [72], the\nstandard uncertainties on the two parameters are obtained from the diagonal matrix elements\nof the inverse of H. Assuming now that the uncertainty of the energy level measurements \u03c3E is\nconstant, the standard error of X0 is found to be\n2\n,\n\u03b4(X0 )2 = f (va\u2217 , vb\u2217 )\u03c3E\n\n(27)\n\nwhere f (va\u2217 , vb\u2217 ) is a function of the extreme values of v \u2217 only, given by\nf (va , vb ) =\n\nH22\n2 .\nH11 H22 \u2212 H12\n\n(28)\n\nThe relative uncertainty of the lifetime value is thus\n\u03c3\u03c4 =\n\n\u03b4(\u03c4 )\n1 \u03b4(X0 )\n=\n;\n\u03c4\n2 X0\n\n(29)\n\nIt is of course proportional to \u03c3E and, apart from its dependence on the extreme v \u2217 -values (see\nEquation (28)), it is proportional to (C3 )2 and to \u03bc3 (see Equation (11)).\nA numerical application of the formula (29) can be performed with the characteristics of the\nstrontium study [16], with v \u2217 values in the interval va\u2217 \u223c 84 to vb\u2217 \u223c 160 and an experimental\nuncertainty \u03c3E \u223c 300 MHz. The relative uncertainty on the lifetime value depends very little\n\u2217 value, which is not given in the reference. In the example below, it varies by about\non the vD\n\u2217 varying from 0 to 1. However, as we will see below, it depends\n4 % of its own value for vD\n\u2217\nstrongly on the extreme v -values. We find here an uncertainty \u03c3\u03c4 of the order of 0.088 %, i.e.\nabout the same as given in the paper. For ytterbium [17], the extreme v \u2217 values are va\u2217 = 103\nand vb\u2217 = 174 but the experimental uncertainty is not given. The error bar given in the paper,\n0.09 %, would correspond to \u03c3E \u223c 200 MHz, which is likely for such experiments.\nA general trend of the error bar on the lifetime value obtained from a two-parameter LeRoyBernstein fit can be illustrated on the strontium example. In Figure 2, we show the values of\n\u03c3\u03c4 corresponding to either a fixed va\u2217 value (lowest level) or a fixed vb\u2217 value (highest level), the\nother v \u2217 -limit varying. When fixing va\u2217 at 160, a very small uncertainty of the order of 0.25 %\nis obtained as soon as vb\u2217 is of the order of 100. Conversely, even for a value of va\u2217 as low as 10,\n\u03c3\u03c4 does not approach this value before vb\u2217 is very close to 160. One would say that the deepest\nlevels are crucial to reduce the uncertainty for the X0 parameter of the LR-B fit. It is important\nto recall that it is assumed that the LR-B law is verified for all the considered v \u2217 values, which\nsettles of course a lower bound to va\u2217 . These results help us to qualitatively understand why the\n\n\f2\n\nlifetime uncertainty \u03c3\u03c4 %\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1,5\n\n1\n\n0,5\n\n0\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nv*b (deepest level)\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nv*a (highest level)\n\nFigure 2. Variation of the relative uncertainty \u03c3\u03c4 on the lifetime value derived from an analysis using LeRoyBernstein law. The chosen example is the one of 88 Sr studied in Refs [20] and [16]. The experimental uncertainty\non the level energy measurements is assumed to be \u03c3E = 300 MHz (dashed lines) or \u03c3E = 30 MHz (full lines).\nIn the left graph, we show the variations of \u03c3\u03c4 vs the v \u2217 value of the deepest level included in the fit, vb\u2217 ; the v \u2217\nvalue of the highest level is kept constant at va\u2217 = 10. In the right graph, the roles of va\u2217 and vb\u2217 are exchanged;\nthe fixed value is vb\u2217 = 160. It is of course assumed that the LeRoy-Bernstein law is valid down to this vb\u2217 value.\nvery precise measurements from v \u2217 = 48 to v \u2217 = 61 with \u03c3E = 5 MHz of the first strontium\nstudy [20] yielded a less accurate lifetime value than the measurements of the second one [16],\nwhose experimental uncertainty, \u03c3E = 300 MHz, is much larger, but for wich the v \u2217 values run\nbetween v \u2217 = 84 to v \u2217 = 160.\nIt is interesting to notice that the present estimation of the error bar using the LeRoyBernstein law is meaningful for all studies of Section 4 (i.e. all studies but the 0\u2212\ng ones), even if\nthe analysis relies on quantum calculations. For calcium, using the v \u2217 values and the \u03c3E value\nof Ref [19] we find \u03c3\u03c4 \u223c 0.033 % instead of 0.037 %; for strontium, using the v \u2217 values and the\n\u03c3E value of Ref [20], we find \u03c3\u03c4 \u223c 1.07 % instead of 0.57 %. It is not surprising that the LR-B\nestimation gives a good result: as only two parameters are included in the fit, the situation is\nthe same as in a LeRoy-Bernstein analysis. In the lithium studies, using the v \u2217 values of Ref\n[18] and assuming \u03c3E \u223c 100 MHz gives \u03c3\u03c4 \u223c 0.025 % for 6 Li and \u03c3\u03c4 \u223c 0.11 % for 7 Li, instead\nof \u03c3\u03c4 \u223c 0.026 % for the two isotopes in the above reference. We did not expect such a good\nagreement, since three parameters are introduced in the model; it appears that the correlations\nbetween the C3 and C6 parameters (which are not included in our estimation) do not increase\nthe uncertainty on the C3 value.\n5.3. Other cases\nWhen the number of parameters increases, the matrix of the derivatives generally does not have\na simple analytical expression. In the different studies of PAS on alkalis reviewed here, it is often\ndifficult to retrieve how the different authors evaluate the given final error bar. The experimental\nuncertainty \u03c3E is sometimes missing as well as the \u03c72 or rms value characterizing their best fit\nand the corresponding residuals.\nIn the sodium case, we did not find the \u03c72 or rms value of the fit (it could be recalculated,\nsince calculated and measured values of the 7 vibrational levels are displayed), and neither the\n\n\fmethod used for the estimation of the uncertainty. Systematic errors coming from non-optimized\nparameters or from insufficiencies of the model were examined.\nIn the potassium case, the situation is similar. The \u03c72 value given in Table 2, 0.42, is derived\nfrom the rms value of fit, 1.3x10\u22123 cm\u22121 . Systematic errors are introduced, but it is difficult to\nfind out wether the correlations between the 2 parameters are taken into account or not.\nConcerning the first rubidium study [13], the \u03c72 value given in the Table, 2.5, has been\nrecalculated to fit the definition of Equation (18) and might be considered as being a little\ntoo large. The estimation of the error bar on the final C3 value is well described. Systematic\nerrors are checked and correlations between parameters are in principle accounted for since\nthe author draws the contours of the \u03c72 function just as described above (end of Section 5.1).\nHowever, we remark that some free parameters did not move (or moved extremely little) from\ntheir initial value. We observed a very similar situation in our work on cesium [10]: we attribute\nthis pathological behavior to an overly large number of parameters, which are thus strongly\ncorrelated.\nIn the second study on rubidium [14], where the rms value corresponds to a very satisfying\n\u03c72 value of 1.1, the evaluation of the uncertainty takes into account only the binary correlations\nbetween the parameters: the final error bar was therefore certainly underestimated.\nConcerning cesium, the uncertainty obtained in the first paper [15] is one hundred times\nsmaller than the one obtained in Ref [10], whereas the rms value was notably smaller in the\nsecond paper. The bias introduced in the model by the omission of the two deepest levels can\npartially explain this somehow paradoxical situation. A slightly \"wrong\" model requires more\nadjustable parameters, with more restrained values, leading to worse agreement between the\ndata. In addition, in Ref [15] like in Ref [14], only binary correlations between the parameters\nwere considered. In the second paper [10], we did a careful analysis of the estimation of the\nuncertainty of the lifetime value. What clearly appeared was that the interdependence of the\nparameters was very strong, probably because the number of parameters was too large. The \u03c72\nvalue is rather small, which might be a clue to such a situation. We tried to linearize the model\nand to calculate the standard errors from the covariance matrix, as described above: the values\nobtained in this way were much too large for the linear approximation to remain valid. We\nthus tried to draw the contours of the \u03c72 function, but we found that the results of the fitting\nprocedure depended in an unpredictable way on the allowed variation range of the parameters.\nLike in Ref [13], some free parameters did sometimes not move very much from their initial value.\nThe consequence was that noticeably different parameter sets were yielding the same theoryexperiment agreement. As available theoretical values of the long-range interaction coefficients\nare not precise enough, it is difficult to reduce the number of parameters of the fit. Reducing\nthe experimental uncertainty \u03c3E should probably allow one to get rid of these difficulties and\nwould certainly increase the accuracy of the lifetime determination.\nThe difficulties one might encounter in the evaluation of the uncertainty as the number of\nparameters of the model increases is certainly no reason to give up on the determination of\natomic radiative lifetime values through PAS: the conclusion of this section is that a careful\nanalysis of the errors coming from the fit itself must always be performed, and that such a study\nwill guide one in the choice of the model and of the energy range of the levels introduced in the\nfit.\n6. Conclusion\nIn this paper we have reviewed recent experiments which derive atomic radiative lifetime values\nfrom photoassociative spectroscopy. This is possible because the energy spacing of the high-lying\nmolecular states depends mainly on the long-range interatomic interaction, which itself depends\non the same atomic radial integral as the atomic lifetime. Accurate values of atomic radiative\nlifetimes have always been difficult to obtain, both theoretically and experimentally. The\n\n\femergence of the PAS method of determination, based on a conceptually new approach, is thus\nvery interesting. As potential systematic errors are quite different from those expected in atomic\nphysics experiments, for instance, it provides a useful check on these lifetime determinations.\nThe lifetime values discussed in this paper are summarized in Figure 3, where the high quality\nof the PAS data is clearly visible.\nThe analysis consists in extracting, from the spectroscopic data, a precise long-range\ncoefficient: a model is chosen for the calculation of the level energies and the parameters of\nthe model are fitted to the experimental data. The model is either semi-classical or quantummechanical. In the first case, a two-parameter model, the so-called LeRoy-Bernstein law, was\nused in Sr and Yb studies. Otherwise, molecular potentials have to be considered. In principle,\nthe long-range interaction has to be connected with ab initio or RKR potentials, as was the case\nfor the Li, Ca and Sr studies. In the case of Na, K, Rb and Cs, the relevant potentials are called\n\"pure long-range\" and involve only long-range interaction parameters. The R\u22123 behavior of the\nlong-range interaction which is the basis of the lifetime determination is only asymptotically\nvalid. A number of effects, which are likely to contribute to the interaction energy, have been\nintroduced in the models, at the cost of an increased number of parameters.\nConcerning the LeRoy-Bernstein approach, we first recall that its validity should always be\ncarefully checked. Concerning the precision that can then be obtained, a very simple calculation\nallows one to predict the uncertainty on the lifetime value starting from the experimental value\nof the spectroscopic uncertainty and from the v values of the vibrational levels introduced in the\nfit. The predictions are the same for quantum calculations as long as only two free parameters\nare needed. When additional parameters are introduced, the estimation of the uncertainty is\nmore difficult. It has probably been sometimes underestimated, mainly because the role of the\ncorrelations between the parameters was not wholly considered. We recall a simple and general\nestimation of these effects, based on a linearization of the model. If it is not possible to apply\nit, contour calculations of the \u03c72 function have to be drawn and one has to carefully check\nthe reproducibility of the convergence process: in the cesium case, for instance, we observed\nunpredictable results, due to an overly large number of parameters. We hope to solve this\nparticular problem with the analysis of new experimental PAS results with improved accuracy\ncurrently in progress in our lab.\nIn spite of these difficulties, the ensemble of atomic radiative lifetimes results obtained\nthrough PAS is quite impressive and convincing. A number of accurate values have been derived,\nand they agree well with most of the previous results, obtained from accurate atomic physics\nmeasurements [8]. The agreement with available theoretical results is generally satisfying. It\nis even excellent in the case of lithium for which very precise calculations have been performed\ndue to its simple atomic structure.\nFinally, the PAS method for extracting accurate atomic radiative lifetimes could represent\na promising perspective for other elements which are nowadays laser-cooled and trapped, like\nMagnesium [74], Chromium [75], Silver [76], Erbium [77], Francium [78], and Radium [79],\nprovided that trapping densities are high enough to perform efficient PA experiments.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n\nJ\u00f6nsson P, Ynnerman A, Fischer C F, Godefroid M R and Olsen J 1996 Phys.
