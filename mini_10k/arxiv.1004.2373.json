The magnetic compound [(CuCl2 tachH)3 Cl]Cl2\nis a geometrically frustrated triangular spin tube, the\nfrustration being related both to the triangular arrangement of its rungs and to the twisted geometry of the legs,\ncompare Fig. 1(a). The relatively simple exchange pathway structure, described only by two dominant Heisenberg exchange couplings [14, 15], as well as the extremely\nweak exchange interactions between neighboring tubes\nrenders [(CuCl2 tachH)3 Cl]Cl2 an excellent real material to study general properties of the spin-tube systems\n[5, 7, 10, 12, 16]. An appropriate spin Hamiltonian describing the magnetic properties of this material reads\nas\nH =\n\nL X\n3\nX\n\n[J1 \u03c3 n,\u03b1 * \u03c3 n,\u03b1+1\n\n(1)\n\nn=1 \u03b1=1\n\nthis material.

As depicted in Fig. 1 (b), the\ntwisted spin tube may also be thought of as a three-leg\nladder with periodic boundary conditions in the rung direction, where the parameters J1 and J2 are strengths\nof the rung and crossing (diagonal) exchange bonds, respectively. [(CuCl2 tachH)3 Cl]Cl2 is characterized by the\nparameters J1 /kB = 1.8 K and J2 /kB = 3.9 K [15],\n\u2032\nwhereas the leg exchange constant J2 > 0, introduced\nfor the sake of clarity in Fig. 1 (b), seems to vanish in\n\nTwo extreme scenarios for the ground state of Eq. (1)\nwith antiferromagnetic couplings (J1 , J2 > 0) were outlined in Ref. [10]. In the case of dominating J1 couplings, the system effectively maps onto an effective spinchirality model, where the additional chirality degrees of\nfreedom appear as a result of the ground-state degeneracy of each individual triangle. On the other hand, for\ndominating J2 couplings the system maps onto an effective spin-3/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain (AHC)\ncontaining additional biquadratic exchange couplings. In\nthis Letter, we demonstrate by means of refined specific\nheat measurements, that the low-temperature proper-\n\n\f2\n\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\nL \u0014\nX\n9\nJ1\n2\nsn \u2212\n+ J2 sn * sn+1 + V .\nH=\n2\n4\nn=1\n\n(2)\n\nHere sn = \u03c3 n,1 + \u03c3 n,2 + \u03c3 n,3 is the rung spin operator\nrelated to the nth triangle. The number of Cu sites is\nN = 3L, where L is the number of rungs.

The last two equations ex\u2032\nplicitly show that the condition J2 = J2 defines a special symmetric line in the parameter space on which the\nrung spin operators sn are conserved quantities. On this\nline, the Hilbert space is decomposed into the invariant\nsubspaces (sectors) [s1 , s2 , . . . , sL ], where the local spin\nquantum numbers sn = 1/2, 3/2 are defined, as usual, by\nthe relations s2n = sn (sn + 1) (n = 1, . . . , L). In particular, if the Hamiltonian ground state lies in the sector\n\u2032\n[3/2, 3/2, . . . , 3/2], then Eq. (2) for J2 = J2 will describe\na spin-3/2 AHC characterized by the effective exchange\nconstant Jeff = J2 . Up to first order in the (formally)\n\u2032\nsmall parameter (J2 \u2212J2 )/J1 , the effect of the interaction\nterm V in Eq. (2) is reduced to a simple renormalization\nof the exchange constant in the effective spin-3/2 AHC:\n\u2032\nJeff \u2212\u2192 Jeff = J2 + (J2 \u2212 J2 )/3. At the special point\n\u2032\nJ2 = 0, the result Jeff = 2J2 /3 coincides with the firstorder result of Ref. [10], which is obtained by another\nperturbation scheme starting from the limit |J1 | \u226b J2\n(J1 < 0).\nLow-lying spin excitations\u2013As argued below, the contributions to the low-temperature specific heat of the spin\n\ntube material [(CuCl2 tachH)3 Cl]Cl2 are dominated by\nthree types of low-lying spin excitations. Apart from the\nstandard gapless excitations (characteristic of any halfinteger AHC with short-range exchange couplings), important contributions to the specific heat appear from\ntwo additional branches of low-lying gapped magnontype modes, which are related to the chirality degrees\nof freedom of the local triangles.\nA qualitative picture of the low-lying spin excitations\ncan be obtained already in the framework of the semiclassical spin-wave approach starting from the classical N\u00e9el\nconfiguration |St , \u2212St , . . .i, where St is the maximal value\nof the z-component of the rung spin (St = 3/2 in the\npresent case). Since the elementary cell contains three\nspin-S variables, there appear three different branches of\nspin-wave modes\nEm (kx ) = 4SJ2 \u00d7\n(4)\ns\u0012\n\u00132\n1\nky\n2\n\u2212 [cos kx +cos(kx +ky )] ,\n1\u2212\u03b1 sin2\n2\n4\nwhere \u03b1 = J1 /J2 , ky = 2\u03c0m/3 (m = 0, 1, 2), and S is\nthe spin of a single site (S = 1/2 in the present case). As\nmay be expected, the energy of the m = 0 branch does\nnot depend on the parameter J1 , since it is related to the\ndynamics of the cell spins sn as a whole:\n2J2\n.\n(5)\n3\nThe above expressions reproduce the well-known semiclassical results for the dispersion relation and the related spin-wave velocity vs of a spin-(3 * S) AHC with the\neffective exchange constant Jeff = 2J2 /3.\nE0 (kx ) = vs | sin kx |,\n\nvs = (6S)\n\nky = 0\n\n8\n\nE m /kB [K]\n\nties of the spin tube material [(CuCl2 tachH)3 Cl]Cl2 reproduce the behavior of a spin-3/2 AHC characterized\nby the effective short-range exchange coupling constant\nJeff = 2J2 /3. Since the exchange interactions between\ndifferent tubes are extremely small, the discussed compound also provides a rare example of spin-3/2 AHC [17\u2013\n21]. The experimental observables strongly suggest that\nif the system ever orders this should be much below 0.1 K.\nAt elevated temperatures the measured specific heat exhibits a big Schottky-type peak located around T \u2248 2 K.\nA detailed analysis \u2013 combining the semiclassical spinwave approach with a number of numerical techniques\nsuch as the Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method, the\nLanczos exact numerical diagonalization (ED), and the\ncomplete exact diagonalization [22, 23] \u2013 implies that\nthe main contribution to the specific-heat peak stems\nfrom the lowest-lying gapped magnon excitations resulting from the internal degrees of freedom of the composite\nrung spins.\nFor the following discussions it is instructive to rewrite\nEq.

(5)\nand (6)) compared with the lowest triplet excitations in two\nperiodic clusters (symbols).\n\nThe dispersion relations of the ky = 2\u03c0/3 and ky =\n4\u03c0/3 excitations can be expressed in the following form\ns\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n,\n(6)\nE1,2 (kx ) = \u2206 + 4S J2 sin kx \u2213\n3\n\n\f3\np\nwhere the excitation gap \u2206 = 4SJ2 (1 \u2212 3\u03b1/4)2 \u2212 1/4\ncorresponds to the lowest-lying modes at wave vectors\nkx = \u03c0/3 and 2\u03c0/3.\nThe solid curves in Fig. 2 show the dispersion relations of the discussed spin-wave excitations. On the other\nhand, the symbols depict the positions of the lowest-lying\ntriplet states, as obtained by the ED method for periodic\nclusters containing L = 8 and 12 unit cells [27]. Apart\nfrom the finite-size effects related to the ED results, it is\nclearly seen that both methods qualitatively yield similar results. As a matter of fact, the discussed spinwave branches may also be considered as one-dimensional\nanalogs of the three spin-wave branches in the triangular\nlattice antiferromagnet. In this respect, the lowest-lying\nexcitations at kx = 0, 2\u03c0/3 and 4\u03c0/3 in the spin tube are\none-dimensional analogs of the three Goldstone modes in\nthe triangular lattice antiferromagnet.\nMore accurate estimates for the parameters of the excitation spectrum vs and \u2206 can be obtained from an\nextrapolation of the ED results for L = 6, 8, 10, and 12\nunit cells. Using the approach of Ref. [18], one finds the\nfollowing estimates from the extrapolations of E0 (2\u03c0/L)\nvs. sin(2\u03c0/L)/L and E1 (2\u03c0/3) vs. 1/L (see Fig. 3):\nvs /kB = 10.06 K = 3.87\n\n2J2\n, \u2206/kB = 5.32 K .\n3kB\n\n(7)\n\nInterestingly, the extrapolation result 3vs /(2J2 ) = 3.87\nexactly reproduces the density-matrix renormalization\ngroup estimate for the spin-wave velocity of the spin-3/2\nAHC characterized by the exchange constant 2J2 /3 [18].\nAs already discussed, the same effective exchange constant (Jeff = 2J2 /3) arises both in the first-order result\nfor the effective spin model and in the semiclassical spinwave approach. Below we demonstrate numerically that\nthe specific heat of a spin-3/2 AHC with the exchange\nconstant 2J2 /3 excellently reproduces the experimental\nresults in the low-temperature region T \u2264 0.5 K.\n\n6.4\n\n\u2206/\u03ba B [K]\n\nE 0 /(k B L) [K]\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n6\n5.6\n5.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\nsin( 2\u03c0 / L)/L\n\n0.12\n\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0.16\n\n1/L\n\nFIG. 3: Extrapolation of the ED results giving the parameters\nof the excitation spectrum vs (l.h.s.) and \u2206 (r.h.s.).\n\nLow-temperature specific heat \u2013The specific heat,\nFigs. 4 and 5, was measured at the Institute for\nMaterials Research (IMR) of Tohoku University using polycrystalline samples of the spin tube material\n[(CuCl2 tachH)3 Cl]Cl2 . The solid curve in Fig. 4 depicts\nthe specific heat of a spin-3/2 periodic AHC composed\n\nof 100 spin sites. The specific heat is evaluated by means\nof a QMC method employing the ALPS code [24]. As\nan effective exchange parameter we used Jeff = 2J2 /3.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 4, the QMC result reproduces the\nexperimental data very well in the region T \u2264 0.5. This\n\u2032\n\u2032\nmeans that even for J2 = 0, when the parameter (J2 \u2212J2 )\nis definitely not small, the low-energy physics of Hamiltonian (1) is described by the spin-3/2 AHC. Therefore,\nit turns out that the theoretically predicted biquadratic\nexchange term [3, 10] plays no role in the experimentally\ninteresting region of the phase diagram characterized by\nthe dimensionless parameter J1 /J2 = 0.46.\n\nFIG. 4: Specific heat (per Cu spin) of [(CuCl2 tachH)3 Cl]Cl2 .\nThe symbols denote the experimental values. The solid curve\nis the QMC result for a spin-3/2 chain of length L = 100. The\ndashed line provides the linear specific heat corresponding to\nthe universal Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid form presented by\nEq. (8), by using the extrapolation result vs = 10.06 K.\n\nTurning to the extremely low-temperature regime,\nwe expect the universal specific-heat behavior of the\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid\nC(T )\n\u03c0cT\n=\n,\nN kB\n9vs\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the constant c stands for the so-called topological charge (c = 1 for a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state)\nand vs is the velocity of the gapless spin excitations. As\nclearly seen in Fig. 4, already for T \u2264 0.5 K the measured\nspecific heat coincides with the QMC results and nicely\nextrapolates towards the universal behavior repesented\nby Eq. (8). The latter observations strongly imply that\nthe spin tube compound [(CuCl2 tachH)3 Cl]Cl2 is characterized by a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid ground\nstate. In a recent report, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\nmeasurements also indicate a gapless spin state in the\nsame material based on estimates for the extremely lowtemperature part of the magnetic susceptibility [25].\nTo explain the experimental data at intermediate temperatures around 2 K, we use the established structure\nof the low-lying excitation spectrum, compare Fig. 2. As\na rough approximation, one may take E1,2 (kx ) \u2248 \u2206 and\nuse the well-known expression for the specific heat of a\ntwo-level system (with the assumption that the excited\n\n\f4\nlevel has twice the weight of the ground state, i.e., r = 2\nin the following expression). Since the exact density of\nstates is not known in the thermodynamic limit, we use\nan overall parameter A in order to fix the height of the\nSchottky peak:\nr(\u2206/T )2 exp(\u2206/T )\nC\n=A\n.\nN kB\n[exp(\u2206/T ) + r]2\n\n(9)\n\nNotice that the position of the peak does not depend on\nthe value of A. The expression for C(T ), Eq. (9), with\n\u2206/kB = 5.32 K is plotted in Fig. 5 by a thick curve\ntogether with the experimental data. One observes that\nit reproduces very well not only the position of the peak\n(Tm \u2248 2 K) but also the behavior of the specific heat\nfor T < Tm down to T \u2248 0.7 K, where the contribution\nfrom the gapless branch E0 (kx ) becomes important. In\naddition, in Fig. 5 we also show the specific heat that\nresults from complete diagonalizations of a few finite-size\nperiodic clusters. As easily seen, the overall agreement is\ngood, in spite of the pronounced finite-size effects.\n\nfrom the lowest-lying gapped magnon-type excitations\nresulting from the internal degrees of freedom of the\ncomposite rung spins.\nAcknowledgments\u2013Computing time at the Leibniz\nComputing Center in Garching is gratefully acknowledged.

The broken\ncurves denote the specific heat for three complete diagonalizations for finite sizes.\n\nTurning to higher temperatures, a few words are necessary to expain the discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results for C(T ). Notice that already\nat T \u2248 2 K the phonon contribution begins to dominate the specific heat. Since the detailed phonon spectral\ndensity is unknown, the raw experimental data for C(T )\nwas \u2013 as usually \u2013 corrected by subtracting a reasonable\nDebye-like specific heat contribution [26].\nConclusion\u2013We demonstrated that the lowtemperature specific heat behavior of the spin tube\ncompound [(CuCl2 tachH)3 Cl]Cl2 suggests a TomonagaLuttinger liquid type ground state for this material,\ncorresponding to an effective spin-3/2 antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg chain characterized by the short-ranged\nexchange-coupling constant Jeff = 2J2 /3. On the other\nhand, we argued that the main contribution to the\nobserved Schottky-type peak around T \u2248 2 K comes\n\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n\n[21]\n\nElectronic address: \u00a1Nedko.Ivanov@Physik.Uni-Magdeburg.DE\u00bf\nElectronic address: jschnack@uni-bielefeld.de\nElectronic address: nojiri@imr.tohoku.ac.jp\nP.
