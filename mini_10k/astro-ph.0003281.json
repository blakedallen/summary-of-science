The dark matter halos\nare most important there, so that conclusions about their\nshape, mass and extent may be drawn that are less dependent on assumed mass-to-light ratios of the observed stars.\nMost of the angular momentum resides at large radii, and\nrelaxation times are longest there, possibly enabling echos\nof the formation process to be observed directly. However,\nthe required observations are rather difficult. The integrated\nstellar light of a galaxy rapidly becomes too weak at large\nradii to do spectroscopy. In the case of elliptical galaxies, the\nold stellar populations have now in a few cases been probed\nas far as two effective radii (e.g., Carollo et al. 1995; Gerhard\net al. 1997).\nSome tracers, such as globular clusters and H i emission,\ncan be observed at larger radii, but neither provides a reliable tracer of the kinematics of the relaxed, old stellar population. Moreover systems like S0s and ellipticals generally\nlack an extensive gaseous disk. Fortunately an alternative\ntracer of the kinematics out to large radii has been identified\nby Hui et al. (1993), who showed that the radial velocities\nof a galaxy's planetary nebula (PN) population constitute a\nsuitable diagnostic. Planetary nebulae (PNe) appear in the\npost-main sequence phase of stars in the range 0.8 - 8 M\u2299 .\nFortunately, in all but the very youngest of systems the PN\npopulation is strongly correlated with the older, and therefore dynamically relaxed, population of low-mass stars. This\nc 1999 RAS\n\nstatement is true not only because of the statistics of stellar\nformation and evolution, but also because the PN lifetime\nis itself a strongly decreasing function of progenitor mass\n(Vassiliadis & Wood 1994).\nPNe emit almost all of their light in a few bright emission lines, particularly the [O iii] line at 5007\u00c5. There is\nevidence that the PN [O iii] luminosity function is essentially constant with galaxy type and metallicity (Jacoby et\nal 1992), so that the observed bright-end cutoff magnitude\nM \u2217 (Ciardullo et al 1989) represents a 'standard candle'\nwith which distances can be determined. At a distance of\n10 Mpc, this cutoff corresponds to a flux of 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221216\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , making PNe within one dex of this limit easily\ndetectable in one night with a 4-m telescope. As a rule of\nthumb, approximately 100 such PNe are found to be present\nper 109 L\u2299 of B-band luminosity (Hui 1993), so they are seen\nin sufficient number to study the kinematics of the stellar\npopulation of the host galaxy.\nThe usual approach in making such kinematic studies has been to identify the PN population by narrow-band\nimaging and then to re-observe the detected PNe spectroscopically to obtain radial velocities. However, other strategies exist that avoid the need for several observing runs.\nFor example, Tremblay et al. (1995) used Fabry-Perot measurements in a PN kinematics study of the SB0 galaxy\nNGC 3384. In this paper, we describe a novel alternative,\nbased on slitless spectroscopy, and discuss its application to\nthe Sab galaxy M94.\n\n\f2\n\nN.G. Douglas, J. Gerssen, K. Kuijken and M.R.

The narrowband images in the two arms allow one to identify the PNe and\nmeasure their line intensities in both the [O iii] 5007\u00c5 and H\u03b1\nlines. The dispersive element in the blue arm shifts each PN image\nby an amount proportional to its redshift. In the red arm the\ngrating has been replaced by a mirror.\n\n2\n\nDETECTION AND KINEMATICS OF PNE\nTHROUGH SLITLESS SPECTROSCOPY\n\nOur method for obtaining the kinematics of PNe is outlined in Figure 1. The galaxy under study is imaged through\nnarrow-band filters around the two strongest emission lines\nin a typical PN spectrum, H\u03b1 and [O iii]. The H\u03b1 image is\nrecorded directly, but the [O iii] light is dispersed. Comparison of the dispersed and undispersed images then allows the\nkinematics of the PNe to be measured, without prior knowledge of the location of the PNe. Two modes of analysis are\npossible:\nDispersed/Undispersed Imaging (DUI): In the dispersed blue arm the PNe will be visible through their [O iii]\nemission as point sources, displaced from their 'true' positions by an amount related to their radial velocity, against\na background of dispersed galactic light. The red arm will\ndetect the PNe through their H\u03b1 emission, along with any\nother objects with line or continuum emission in the pass\nband of the filter. Assuming that the PNe can be unambiguously identified in the H\u03b1 image, their position in the\n[O iii] image will give the radial velocity. We chose to disperse the blue rather than the red light since PN have a\nhigher flux at [O iii] than at H\u03b1, and gratings are less efficient than mirrors.\nCounter-Dispersed Imaging (CDI): The method of\n\ncounter-dispersed imaging was described in an earlier paper (Douglas & Taylor 1999). In this mode, pairs of dispersed [O iii] images are made with the entire spectrograph\nrotated by 180 degrees between exposures. The difference\nin the position of a given PN in the two dispersed images\nagain reflects its radial velocity. In this case the undispersed\nH\u03b1 image can be used as a consistency check on the derived\npositions of the PNe.\nWe have implemented our method on the ISIS mediumdispersion spectrograph at the Cassegrain (f/10.94) focus\nof the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. The slit unit was\nremoved during the observations, and the [O iii] and H\u03b1\nlight paths were separated with a dichroic before being\npassed through appropriate narrow-band filters. The filters\n(\u03bb5026/47 and \u03bb6581/50) were custom-made for this project\nin order to exploit the full 4 \u00d7 1 arcmin field of the instrument in slitless mode, and to give adequate velocity coverage. We used a 1200 g/mm (first order) grating in the blue\narm. Both arms contained 10242 -pixel Tek CCD detectors.\nThus, we obtained dispersed images in the blue (calibration\nshowed the dispersion to be about 24 km s\u22121 per pixel) and\nsimultaneous direct images in the red. DUI observations are\naccomplished in a single exposure; CDI requires two exposures.\nThe overall efficiency of this setup, including telescope,\ninstrument, filter and CCD, was found from observations of\na standard star (Feige 34) to be 14% in the blue and 20%\nin the red for air mass of 0. We therefore expected to detect\n\u223c 2.7 [O iii] photons per second from the brightest PN when\nviewed at 6 Mpc. Dark sky (V=21.4) would produce \u223c2\ncounts per arcsec2 per second, and the background light of\nthe galaxy 1\u20135 counts per arcsec2 . A reasonable goal is to\nobtain a 4\u03c3 detection of the PN population over the top\ndecade (2.5 mag) of the luminosity function. This requires \u223c\n4 hours of integration if the seeing conditions are of the order\nof one arcsec. The required integration time is approximately\nproportional to the square of the seeing.\n\n3\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nThe observations were carried out on 1997 April 11 and 12.\nFor this pilot project NGC 4736 (M94) was chosen. It has a\nlarge angular size and is at a distance of 6 Mpc (Bosma et al\n1977). The galaxy shows some peculiar morphological features, most notably an inner and an outer optical ring with\nradii of 1 and 5.5 arcmin respectively. The stellar light is too\nfaint for direct optical spectroscopy outside 1 arcmin, and\nour goal was to measure PN kinematics to three times this\nradius. Key parameters of NGC 4736 are listed in Table 1,\nand the observing log is given in Table 2.\nTwo fields were observed, 3 arcmin west of centre on\nthe major axis, and 3 arcmin north of centre on the minor axis. The major axis was observed at two orientations\n(allowing CDI mode) while the minor axis was observed in\none orientation only. We took the major axis position angle to be 90\u25e6 , as would seem appropriate from the relevant\nisophotes (see Figure 3). Total integration times were 6.0hrs\non the Western field (4.6hrs in one orientation, and 1.4hrs\nwith the spectrograph rotated by 180 degrees), and 3hrs on\nthe Northern field. The observing conditions were close to\nphotometic with seeing, as judged from stellar images in the\nc 1999 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20138\n\n\fPNe Kinematics in M94\nTable 1.

We also observed a flux\nstandard star for photometry and a Galactic PN as a radial\nvelocity reference. A second star was observed as a spectral\nreference.\nThe custom-made [O iii] and H\u03b1 filters had a central wavelength and peak transmission of 5026\u00c5/0.823 and\n6581\u00c5/0.915, respectively. The nominal FWHM was 47\u00c5\nand 50\u00c5, while the effective photometic bandwidth was evaluated graphically and found to be 38.7\u00c5 and 45.7\u00c5, respectively.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nDATA REDUCTION\nCalibration\n\nThe dispersion in the blue arm was measured by inserting a\nslit and using an arc lamp, and found to be 0.3992\u00c5/pixel.\nThe spectrum of the star HD66637 was then observed\nthrough the same slit and wavelength-calibrated. Subsequent observations of the same star at numerous positions\nin the field (after removal of the slit) established that the\ndispersion could be taken as constant over the field. The\ncombination of these observations with the undispersed red\narm positions of HD66637 gave an unambiguous solution for\nthe transformation between objects in the red (direct image)\nand blue (dispersed image). (Note that with this technique\nthe radial velocity of the star does not enter into the calculation.)\nTo check the zero point of the velocity scale, we moved\nthe telescope from the reference star to the Galactic planetary nebula PN 49.3+88.1, for which the heliocentric radial\nvelocity is listed as \u2212141 km s\u22121 (Schneider et. al 1983). In\nc 1999 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20138\n\n3\n\nten pointings over the field of the spectrograph we measured\n\u2212136.0 \u00b1 3.2 km s\u22121 , in agreement with the calculated observatory frame redshift of \u2212133 km s\u22121 . Unfortunately we\ndiscovered later that at certain telescope orientations the\nflexure is large enough to cause significantly larger errors.\nHowever, such flexure only introduces an offset in absolute\nvelocity, and does not compromise our ability to study a\ngalaxy's internal kinematics. In order to derive an absolute\ncalibration for the velocity scale, we later obtained a long\nslit observation of two of the objects detected in this analysis\n(see \u00a7 5).\nThe spectrograph field of view with the slit unit removed consists of an approximately unvignetted area of\nabout 4\u2032 \u00d7 1\u2032 , but we obtained useful data outside this region. Correcting the observed fluxes for the vignetting is only\nstraightforward for the red (undispersed) arm. In the blue\narm the correction is complicated by the fact that the image is dispersed. The sky flat measured in the blue arm was\nfound to closely approximate the aperture function in the\nred arm, shifted by a small number of pixels, transformed\nto blue arm coordinates and then convolved with the filter\nprofile at the appropriate dispersion.\nWe therefore carried out the complete analysis after correcting only for the pixel-to-pixel variation of the CCD responses, determined in the usual way. Once the PNe were\nidentified it was possible to determine their wavelength and\ntheir positions in the aperture prior to being shifted by the\nspectrograph, so that the [O iii] magnitudes could then be\ncorrected analytically both for the filter response, which was\nfitted with a polynomial, and for vignetting.\n\n4.2\n\nObject identification\n\nScripts based on IRAF procedures were used for all of the\ndata reduction.\nDue to spectrograph flexure, individual exposures\nneeded to be aligned before being added. This was accomplished by a simple shift (at least one PN was visible in\neach individual exposure). The images were then combined\nby computing a weighted and scaled median. A spatial median filter was applied to the combined frame, and the result\nsubtracted from the original image to yield a field of unresolved objects against a background with a mean of zero.\nThe PNe and any other point sources in the red and\nblue images were extracted by two methods:\n(A) Blinking and hand-tagging, followed by a PSF-fitting\nstep to evaluate the shape and size parameters. For DUI\nmode observing it was usually found to be easier to search\nthe range of possible (red) coordinates corresponding to an\nobject seen in the blue (see Fig. 2).\n(B) an automated procedure based on object lists generated\nwith DAOPHOT. A 2D-gaussian fit to each detected image was\nused to select PN candidates. The FWHM of a candidate\nwas required to be within a small range of that of the seeing\ndisk (PNe are unresolved) and the axial ratio close to the\nvalue 1.28 expected from our instrumental configuration (the\nellipticity arises from the anamorphic effect of the grating).\nThe object lists were then correlated to search for potential\nPN image pairs.\n\n\f4\n\nN.G. Douglas, J. Gerssen, K. Kuijken and M.R. Merrifield\nin the particular case of M94 the problem is manageable\nbecause:\n(i) M94 is sufficiently close that a large fraction of bright\nH ii regions would be spatially extended and thus eliminated\nby one of the object selection criteria; (ii) the H ii regions in\nM94 are mostly confined to features associated with spiral\narms - one of these passes through the eastern extremity\nof our major axis field and all objects there were ignored.\nThe rest of the field, and the minor axis field, are devoid\nof recognised H ii agglomerations; (iii) the total number of\nunresolved objects detected in [O iii] is close to the number\nexpected for PNe on the basis of their luminosity specific\ndensity as seen in other galaxies.\nNone of these factors eliminates the problem entirely,\nbut their combined effect is such that we feel that contamination is negligible. Even if 10% of the PNe had been\nmisidentified the effect on the calculated velocity dispersion\nwould be at most 5%, well below other sources of error.\nHigh redshift galaxies, in which the Ly\u03b1 line is shifted\ninto the [O iii] passband, form another potential source of\ncontamination when long integrations are made of extended\nhalos (Freeman et al. 1999). This is also not a significant\nissue in the present case.\n4.4\n\nFigure 2. An example of the 'postage stamp' method for detecting red counterparts. The boxes on the right each contain one\npoint source identified in the blue frame. The boxes on the left\nside show the corresponding parts of the red frame. Any red counterpart must be located somewhere within the box since the size\nof the box is such that it encompasses the velocity range spanned\nby the filter. The horizontal location of the counterpart is a measure of the object's radial velocity. In the vertical direction we\nrequire the positional agreement to be within one pixel.\n\n4.3\n\nComparing Spectral Modes\n\nWe identified PNe in NGC 4736 along the minor axis with\nDUI mode observations and along the major axis using CDI\n(with DUI mode data being redundant). Although CDI requires two distinct integrations, we found that data obtained\nfrom CDI results in a higher number of detected PN per\nunit integration time. For visual identification using blinking, CDI is considerably easier since the two images have\nthe same plate scale and similar properties with respect to\nsky noise and confusion. Therefore to illustrate the numerical superiority of using two dispersed [O iii] images we rely\non the automated search results for the major axis observations only. 36 PNe were identified in this field from matching\n2.5\u03c3 sources in the counterdispersed [O iii] images. The limiting factor here was the shorter integration time with one\nof the two spectrograph orientations: had both integration\ntimes been equal we would presumably have found yet more\nPNe. By comparison, only 24 PNe were detected from the\nDUI mode analysis of the same field. Therefore, we conclude\nthat a significant number of PNe are too faint in H\u03b1 for the\nDUI mode to detect them.\n\nFalse detections\n\nAs well as PNe, our observations will also detect other objects having a predominantly line-emission spectrum near\nthe [O iii] line. In the case of a bright spiral galaxy like M94\nit is obvious that H ii regions will mimick PNe. As they belong to a younger population than the PNe their inclusion in\nthe analysis would lead to an underestimate of the velocity\ndispersion. Although it is tempting to use the [O iii]/H\u03b1 line\nratio as a discriminant (it tends to be larger in PNe) this\nis not sharp enough to eliminate the H ii regions without\neliminating a fair fraction of the PNe. Unless a better discriminant can be found, this source of contamination may\nultimately restrict the viability of our technique to the elliptical and S0 galaxies for which it was devised. However\n\n5\n\nLONG-SLIT DATA\n\nIt has been mentioned that instrument flexure, particularly\nbetween sets of observations in CDI mode, can lead to an\nuncertainty in the absolute velocity scale. To remove this\nuncertainty we attempted to obtain the velocity of at least\none object in the major axis field via the Willian Herschel\nTelescope service data program. As the PNe are faint, with\neffective V-band magnitude of around 25, the slit had to\nbe positioned 'blind' on the basis of the position computed\nfrom the dispersed data. Fortunately the astrometry does\nnot depend on velocity, but only on correct identification of\nPN pairs, and on the centroiding of the dispersed images of\nstars in the field.\nc 1999 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20138\n\n\fPNe Kinematics in M94\n\n5\n\nTable 3.

The magnitudes have been corrected for vignetting\n(see \u00a74.1). The vignetting correction could not be reliably applied\nfor two objects as they were too close to the edge of the aperture,\nand their magnitudes are not given. FWHM (in pixels) refers to\nthe major axis of the 2D-gaussian fit.\n\nFigure 3. Digitised Sky Survey image of NGC 4736 (North at\ntop) with the observed fields marked with boxes and the PNe\nshown as open circles.\n\nWe requested a spectrum using ISIS in long-slit mode\nand with the slit at a position and PA chosen such as to\nfall across two objects. This provided a good test of the\nastrometry. The service observation was attempted on 1999\nJuly 28. Both objects were acquired, and their separation\nalong the slit agreed with that calculated. One of the objects,\nsuspected of being an H ii region, was confirmed as such.\nThe radial velocities obtained had an internal error of about\n10 km s\u22121 , as judged from the values obtained from different\nlines, and were used to calibrate the major axis data (Table\n3).\n\n6\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe PNe identified along the major axis are listed in Table 3 and those along the minor axis in Table 4. Their positions are also shown in Fig 3. As suggested by the successful long-slit experiment, the positional uncertainty is of\nthe order of 1-2 arcsec. The internal error in the velocities\nis approximately 10 km s\u22121 . The minor axis velocities have\nan offset that has not been determined, but the values as\npresented have an average velocity near systemic, as would\nbe expected. The derivation of velocities from DUI mode\ndata, as was used for the minor axis, is in fact much less\nsensitive to flexure. However, in order to reduce the number\nof candidate objects in the red image, only radial velocities\nbetween 200 and 500 km s\u22121 were searched for, so this table\nhas to be used with caution.\n6.1\n\nLuminosity function\n\nWe placed a premium on detecting as many PNe as possible, even in the partially vignetted region of the instrument.\nConsiderable corrections have been applied, and the magnitudes should therefore only be taken as indicative.

The objects brighter than this cutoff are probably bright H ii regions\n\nthe basic data on NGC 4736 compiled by Mulder (1995)\n(mB = 8.58, D = 6.0 Mpc) we have LB = 2.07 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299 ,\nand on the basis of the results of Hui et al (1993) the expected number of PN in the top decade of the PNLF in\nM94 would therefore be around 2000. Mulder also found the\ngalaxy to be fairly well-fitted by an exponential disk with\nscale length h =57\u2032\u2032 . The region we examined includes 0.029\nof the light of such an exponential, which should therefore\ninclude 59 PNe in the brightest decade. This number compares well with the 53 actually found, though the agreement\nmay be somewhat fortuitous given the incompleteness at the\nfaint end.\n\n6.3\n\nVelocity dispersion\n\nGenerally, the vertical structure in disks of spiral galaxies\nis reasonably well described by an isothermal sheet approximation (van der Kruit & Searle 1982; Bottema 1993). In this\nmodel, the vertical velocity dispersion is found to follow an\nexponential decline with radius with scale length twice that\nof the surface density. With the additional assumption that\nthe dispersion ellipsoid has constant axis ratios throughout\nthe disk, one finds that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion\nfollows the same decline, independent of the galaxy's inclination. We tested this using the major axis data. Figure 6\nshows the velocity dispersion in bins of distance along the\nmajor axis. Seven objects were eliminated from the kinematic analysis as their brightnesses suggested that they are\nH ii regions. The curve is the least-squares exponential fit,\nyielding central velocity dispersion 111 km s\u22121 and scale\nlength h\u03c3 = 130 arcsec. These are close to the published\nvalue for the central stellar velocity dispersion (120 \u00b1 15\nkm s\u22121 ) obtained from absorption-line spectra (Mulder and\nvan Driel, 1993) and to twice the photometric scale length\nc 1999 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20138\n\n\fPNe Kinematics in M94\n(2h = 114 arcsec), suggesting that the isothermal sheet approximation is reasonable.\n\n120\n\n6.4\n\n100\n\nCombined Kinematic Model\n\nThe binning in Fig 6 effectively assumes that the PNe all lie\nclose to the major axis. In fact, they are located up to one\narcminute from the axis, at azimuths up to 45\u25e6 , so a more sophisticated approach is required. We therefore projected the\nPNe on to a thin disk of fixed inclination (35\u25e6 ), giving r, \u03c6\ncoordinates. The nebulae's line-of-sight velocities can then\nbe compared with a model consisting of a three-dimensional\nisothermal sheet with a flat rotation curve. This model has\nfive parameters, namely the three components of the central velocity dispersion \u03c3z , \u03c3\u03c6 , \u03c3R , the scale length h\u03c3 , and\nthe rotation amplitude. A maximum likelihood method was\nthen used to fit the model. We added twelve PNe from the\nminor axis field (Table 4) to help constrain the fit (two were\nexcluded from the fit as probable H ii regions).\nIn practice the data were not adequate to constrain all\n2\nfive parameters. Using the canonical relationship \u03c3\u03c62 = \u03c3R\n/2\nfrom the epicyclic approximation (Binney & Merrifield 1998,\neq. 11.18) and allowing \u03c3z /\u03c3R to vary over the range 0.2 to\n2.0, we found a robust maximum likelihood solution with\nscale length h\u03c3 = 144 \u00b1 30 arcsec, central velocity dispersion\n\u03c3los = 120 \u00b1 30 km s\u22121 , and circular rotation speed vc =\n177 \u00b1 11 km s\u22121 . These results are consistent with the H i\nrotation speed at 1 arcmin radius (180 km s\u22121 ) and again\nwith twice the photometric scale length.\nIt was not possible to constrain the shape of the velocity ellipsoid with these data \u2013 such an analysis would\nrequire a more complete azimuthal coverage of the galaxy.\nHowever if we assume 0.5 < \u03c3z /\u03c3R < 1.0 then we infer\n75 < \u03c3R < 110 km s\u22121 at one photometric scale length,\nconsistent with the trend between rotation speed and disk\nvelocity dispersion found by Bottema (1993).\nThus far we have ignored measurement error in the velocities, which will tend to increase the measured velocity\ndispersion. This turns out to be a small effect: allowing for\na 1\u03c3 error of 10 km s\u22121 , the fitted dispersion becomes approximately 3% smaller and the scale length is unchanged.\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have demonstrated how the kinematics of\nthe PN population in a galaxy can be measured by slitless spectroscopy through narrow-band filters with a dualbeam spectrograph. We compared two possible modes: dispersed/undispersed imaging, in which a dispersed [O iii] image is compared to an undispersed H\u03b1 image; and counterdispersed imaging, in which two [O iii] images, dispersed in\nopposite directions, are analysed. It turns out that the latter method is more effective: evidently the H\u03b1 fluxes of faint\nPNe are not reliably high enough to allow both spectral lines\nto be used.\nOur pilot experiment was performed on the large nearby\nSab galaxy M94. It has revealed a PN population in the disk\nwhose rotation curve remains flat, and whose velocity dispersion declines radially exponentially, consistent with the\npredictions of a simple isothermal sheet model. PNe were detected out to five exponential scale lengths, well beyond the\nc 1999 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20138\n\n7\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFigure 6.

The number of PNe detected\nwas consistent with expectations.\nThe present experiment was limited to two fields in\nthis large galaxy. Complete coverage of the galaxy should\nyield around 2000 PNe, and would allow a detailed kinematic model to be fitted, including a determination of the\naxis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid following the technique of\nGerssen et al. (1997). Obtaining such data for a small sample of nearby galaxies in just a few nights of 4-m telescope\ntime is a practical proposition.\n\n8\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe WHT is operated on the island of La Palma by the Isaac\nNewton Group in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los\nMuchachos of the Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias.
