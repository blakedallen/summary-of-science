OSIN\n\nAbstract. The aim of the present note is to show that free Burnside groups\nof sufficiently large odd exponent are non\u2013amenable in a certain strong sense,\nmore precisely, their left regular representations are isolated from the trivial\nrepresentation uniformly on finite generating sets. This result is applied to the\nsolution of a strong version of the von Neumann \u2013 Day problem concerning\namenability of groups without non\u2013abelian free subgroups. As another consequence, we obtain that the above\u2013mentioned groups are of uniform exponential\ngrowth. This answers a question of de la Harpe [12].\n\n1. Introduction\nLet us consider the left regular representation of a finitely generated group G on\nthe Hilbert space L2 (G). For any finite generating set X of G, we define \u03b1(G, X)\nas the maximal \u03b5 \u2265 0 such that for any vector v \u2208 L2 (G) of norm ||v|| = 1, there\nexists an element x \u2208 X satisfying the inequality\n||xv \u2212 v|| \u2265 \u03b5.\nIt is easy to check that the existence of a finite generating set X of G such that\n\u03b1(G, X) > 0, implies the inequality \u03b1(G, Y ) > 0 for any other finite generating set\nY \u2286 G. Thus it is natural to consider the quantity\n\u03b1(G) = inf \u03b1(G, X),\nX\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all finite generating sets of G.\nRecall that a group G is called amenable if there exists a finitely additive measure\n\u03bc on the set of all subsets of G which is invariant under the left action of G on itself\nand satisfies \u03bc(G) = 1. One of the most interesting characterizations of amenable\ngroups was obtained by Hulaniski [13] in terms of the left regular representations.\nIn the case of finitely generated groups it can be formulated as follows.\nTheorem 1.1 (Hulaniski, [13]). A finitely generated group G is amenable if and\nonly if \u03b1(G, X) = 0 for some (and hence for any) finite generating set X of G.\nIn particular, we have \u03b1(G) = 0 for any amenable group G. The question\nwhether the equality \u03b1(G) = 0 is equivalent to the amenability of G was open\nDate: Feb 25, 2001.\nKey words and phrases. Left regular representation, amenability, exponential growth rate,\ntorsion group.\nThis work has been supported by RFFR Grant # 99-01-00894 and by the INTAS Grant #\n99-1224.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDENIS V. OSIN\n\nuntil recent time. The first examples of non\u2013amenable finitely generated groups G\nsatisfying \u03b1(G) = 0 have been constructed in [20].\nDefinition 1.2. If \u03b1(G) > 0 for a finitely generated group G, we say that G is\nuniformly non\u2013amenable.\nRecall that a group is said to be elementary if it contains a cyclic subgroup\nof finite index. In the paper [24], Shalom proved that any residually finite non\u2013\nelementary hyperbolic group is uniformly non\u2013amenable. In fact, this is true for\nevery non\u2013amenable hyperbolic group, not necessarily residually finite (see Example\n3.4 below). Essentially all uniformly non\u2013amenable groups known up to now are\nhyperbolic and, in particular, they contain a non\u2013abelian free subgroup. This rises\nthe following natural question, which is a stronger version of the so called von\nNeumann\u2013Day problem (see [6]).\nQuestion 1.1. Does any uniformly non\u2013amenable group contains a non\u2013abelian\nfree subgroup?\nThe main goal of this note is to show that the answer is negative and can be\nobtained in the same way as the solution of the classical von Neumann\u2013Day problem. More precisely, we show that (non\u2013cyclic) free Burnside groups of sufficiently\nlarge odd exponent are uniformly non\u2013amenable. In contrast, we note that finitely\ngenerated torsion groups which are not amenable nor uniformly non\u2013amenable are\nconstructed in [20]. Our main result is the following.\nTheorem 1.3. There exists an integer N > 0 such that any free Burnside group\nB(m, n) of odd exponent n > N and rank m \u2265 2 is uniformly non\u2013amenable.\nCorollary 1.4. There exists a finitely generated uniformly non\u2013amenable group\nwithout non\u2013abelian free subgroups.\nIt should be mentioned that the first examples of non\u2013amenable groups without\nfree subgroups were constructed by Ol'shanskii in [18]. These groups are torsion\nwith unbounded orders of elements. After that, in [2], Adian proved that the free\nBurnside groups B(m, n) are non\u2013amenable whenever m \u2265 2, n is odd, and n \u2265 665.\nWe use Adian's result to prove our Theorem 1.1.\nThe notion of uniform non\u2013amenability is interesting, in particular, in relation\nwith exponential growth rates of finitely generated groups. Recall that the growth\nX\nfunction \u03b3G\n: N \u2212\u2192 N of a group G with respect to a finite generating set X is\ndefined by\nX\n\u03b3G\n(n) = card {g \u2208 G : |g|X \u2264 n}.\nThe exponential growth rate of G with respect to X is the number\nq\nX (n)\n\u03c9(G, X) = lim n \u03b3G\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(the above limit always exists). The quantity\n\n\u03c9(G) = inf \u03c9(G, X)\nX\n\nis called a minimal exponential growth rate of G (the infimum is taken over all\nfinite generating sets of G). One says that the group G has exponential growth if\n\n\fUNIFORM NON\u2013AMENABILITY OF FREE BURNSIDE GROUPS\n\n3\n\n\u03c9(G, X) > 1 for some (or, equivalently, for any) finite generating subset X of G. If\n\u03c9(G) > 1, then the group G is said to have uniform exponential growth.\nThis notion comes from geometry; in particular, if G is a fundamental group of\na compact Riemannian manifold of unit diameter, then log \u03c9(G) is a lower bound\nfor the topological entropy of the geodesic flow of the manifold [16].\nThe first example of a group having non-uniform exponential growth was recently constructed by J. Wilson [25]. On the other hand, there are many examples\nof classes of groups which are known to have uniformly exponential growth, for\nexample:\n(a) non\u2013elementary hyperbolic groups [15];\n(b) free products with amalgamations G \u2217A=B H satisfying the condition (|G :\nA| \u2212 1)(|H : B| \u2212 1) \u2265 2 and HNN\u2013extensions G\u2217A associated with a monomorphisms \u03c61 , \u03c62 : A \u2192 G, where |G : \u03c61 (A)| + |G : \u03c62 (A)| \u2265 3 (see [5]);\n(c) one\u2013relator groups of exponential growth [9];\n(d) solvable groups of exponential growth [23] (the particular case of polycyclic groups was considered independently in [3]); more generally, any elementary\namenable group of exponential growth has uniform exponential growth [22];\n(e) linear groups of exponential growth [7].\nIn the survey [12], de la Harpe asked the following:\nQuestion 1.2. Do the free Burnside groups of sufficiently large odd exponent\nhave uniform exponential growth?\nHere we answer the question positively. In [24], Shalom observed that every\nuniformly non\u2013amenable finitely generated group has uniform exponential growth.\nFrom this and Theorem 1.1, we obtain immediately\nCorollary 1.5. If m \u2265 2, n is odd and large enough, then the group B(m, n) has\nuniform exponential growth.\nIt is worth to note, that in some similar sense uniform non\u2013amenability of free\nBurnside groups of large odd exponent is claimed in the paper [4]. However, in [4]\nauthors uses an unproved result about free subgroups of B(m, n). This result was\nannounced by Ivanov in [14], but the complete proof have never been published.\nAcknowledgements. I would like to thank Alexander Yu. Ol'shanskii for\nuseful comments concerning the construction of free Burnside groups.\n2. Constructing free Burnside groups\nIn this section we recall the construction of presentations of free Burnside groups\nand describe shortly the main properties used in this paper. For details we refer\nto the books [1], [19]. Our discussion heavily depends on results from [19] (for\notherwise our paper would be unreasonably long). In fact, we will not obtain\nany new facts about Burnside groups by analyzing the geometric structure of van\nKampen diagrams; we will only show how to combine certain lemmas from [19] in\norder to obtain the result we need. Our main goal here is to prove Theorem 2.7.\n\n\f4\n\nDENIS V. OSIN\n\nGiven an alphabet A, we denote by |W | the length of a word W over A. For two\nwords U, V over A we write U \u2261 V to express letter\u2013by\u2013letter equality. Finally if\nA is a generating set of a group G, we write U = V whenever two words U and V\nover A\u00b11 represent the same elements of G; we identify the words over A and the\nelements of G represented by them.\nRecall that B(m, n), the free Burnside group of exponent n and rank m, is the\nfree group in the variety defined by the low X n = 1. Throughout this paper we\nwill assume that n is odd and large enough, and m \u2265 2; all lemmas and theorems\nare formulated under these assumptions.\nThe group B(m, n) can be defined by the presentation\n(2.1)\n\nB(A, n) = hA : R = 1, R \u2208\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nRi i,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere A = {a1 , . . . , an } and the sets of relations Ri are constructed as follows\n[19]. We put R0 = \u2205. By induction, suppose that we have already defined the\nset of relations Ri\u22121 , i \u2265 1. Denote by G(i \u2212 1) the group with the presentation\nhA : R = 1, R \u2208 Ri i.\nFor i \u2265 1, a word X over the alphabet A is called simple in the rank i \u2212 1, if\nit is not conjugated to a power of a shorter word in the group G(i \u2212 1) and is not\nconjugated to a power of a period of rank k \u2264 i \u2212 1 in the group G(i \u2212 1). Let us\ndenote by Xi a certain maximal subset of words satisfying the following conditions.\n1) Xi consists of words of length i which are simple in the rank i \u2212 1.\n2) If A, B \u2208 Xi and A 6\u2261 B, then A is not conjugated to B or B \u22121 in the group\nG(i \u2212 1).\nEach word from Xi is called a period of rank i. We introduce the additional relations\nSi = {An : A \u2208 Xi } and set Ri = Ri\u22121 \u222a Si .\nNow we are going to list some results needed for the sequel.\nLemma 2.1 ([19], Theorem 19.4). Any element of B(m, n) is conjugated to a period\nof a certain rank.\nLemma 2.2 ([19], Theorem 19.5). The centralizer of every nontrivial element of\nB(m, n) is a cyclic subgroup of order n.\nFrom Lemma 2.2 we have immediately\nCorollary 2.3. Suppose that a, b are two elements of B(m, n) such that [a, b] 6= 1.\nThen [ai , b] 6= 1 whenever ai 6= 1.\nProof. Suppose that [ai , b] = 1 and ai 6= 1. By Lemma 2.2, the centralizer of ai is\ncyclic. As a, b \u2208 C(ai ), we have a = z m1 and b = z m2 for a certain z \u2208 B(m, n).\nThis contradicts to [a, b] 6= 1.\n\u0003\nIn the following two lemmas the additional parameters d and \u03c3 appear (the parameter \u03c3 here corresponds to 100\u03b6 \u22121 from [19]). Exact values of these parameters\nare not important for us (in fact, d, \u03c3 << n, but the only inequality we need here\n\n\fUNIFORM NON\u2013AMENABILITY OF FREE BURNSIDE GROUPS\n\n5\n\nis \u03c3 < n4 ). It is sufficient to know that there exists parameters d and \u03c3 such that\nthe following two lemmas hold.\nLemma 2.4. Let C be a period of a certain rank, V \u2261 C k , where \u03c3 < k \u2264 12 n.\nSuppose that an element W does not commute with V and has minimal length\namong elements of the double coset hC k iW hC k i. We also assume that [C k , W ] is\nconjugated to Al , where A is a period of a certain rank and |l| \u2264 12 n. Then we have\n|l| \u2264 \u03c3 and the pair [C k , W ], C k is conjugated to the pair (Al , B), where |B| < d|A|.\nOn the proof. The lemma is a simplification of Lemma 25.21 from [19]. We have\nto note that the presentation (2.1) satisfies the condition R (there are no relations\nof the second type at all, see [19, Ch. 8] for definitions and details).\nLemma 2.5. Suppose that l is an integer and A, B \u2208 B(m, n) such that\n1) A is a period of a certain rank;\n2) [A, B] 6= 1 in B(m, n);\n3) |l| \u2264 \u03c3 and |B| < d|A|.\nThen there exists integer s such that the pair (BAls , B) is conjugated to a pair\n(F, T ), where F is a period of a certain rank, [F, T ] 6= 1, and |T | \u2264 3F .\nOn the proof. The proof of this lemma is a part of the proof of Lemma 27.3\nfrom [19]. Namely in order to prove the above assertion we have to repeat (word\nfor word) the last 5 paragraphs of the proof of Lemma 27.3 from [19].\nLemma 2.6. For every odd large enough n \u2208 N, there exist h, k \u2208 N with the\nfollowing property. Suppose that F is a period of a certain rank, T is an element\nof B(m, n) such that [F, T ] 6= 1, and |T | \u2264 3F . Then the elements\nb1 = F k T F k+2 . . . T F k+2h\u22122\nand\nb1 = F k+1 T F k+3 . . . T F k+2h\u22121\nform the basis of the free Burnside group of exponent n.\nProof. Up to notation the statement of the lemma can easily be obtained from\nLemma 39.4 [19]. We only notice that our constants n, k, and h correspond to\nconstants n0 , n and h from [19] respectively.\n\u0003\nNow we are ready to prove the main result of this section.\nTheorem 2.7. For any odd large enough n and m \u2265 2, there exists M \u2208 N having\nthe following property. Let a, b be two non\u2013commuting elements of B(m, n). Then\nthere exist elements u, v \u2208 ha, bi such that {u, v} is the basis of the free Burnside\nsubgroup of exponent n and the lengths of elements u, v with respect to {a, b} satisfy\n|u|{a,b} < M,\n\n|v|{a,b} < M.\n\u2032\n\nProof. By Lemma 2.1, we have a = P \u22121 C k P , for some element P and a period\nC of a certain rank. Without loss of generality we can assume that 0 < k \u2032 < n2 .\n\n\f6\n\nDENIS V. OSIN\nn\n4.\n\nClearly there is a number i \u2208 N such that\nn\n(2.2)\ni<\n2\nand \u03c3 < ik \u2032 < n2 . Thus we have\nRecall that \u03c3 <\n\nai = P \u22121 C k P,\n\n(2.3)\nwhere\n(2.4)\n\n\u03c3<k<\n\nn\n.\n2\n\nUsing Corollary 2.3, we note that\n[C k , P bP \u22121 ] = P [ai , b]P \u22121 6= 1.\nDenote by W0 the element P bP \u22121 and by W the shortest element in the double\ncoset hC k iW0 hC k i. Evidently W = C kk1 W0 C kk2 for some k1 , k2 satisfying the\ninequality\nn\n(2.5)\nmax{|k1 |, |k2 |} < .\n2\nik2 \u22121\nik1\nSince W = P a ba P , we obtain the following inequality by using (2.5) and\n(2.2)\n(2.6)\n\n|P \u22121 W P |{a,b} \u2264 2i + k1 + k2 + 1 < 2n.\n\nIt is clear that [C k , W ] 6= 1. By Lemma 2.1, [C k , W ] is conjugated to Al , where A\nis a period of a certain rank, i.e.,\n[C k , W ] = Q\u22121 Al Q\n\n(2.7)\nfor some element Q. Set\n\nB = Q\u22121 C k Q.\n\n(2.8)\n\nApplying Lemma 2.4, we obtain |l| \u2264 \u03c3 and |B| \u2264 d|A|. Note that all conditions\nof Lemma 2.5 are satisfied for A and B. Therefore, there is integer s such that the\npair (BAls , B) is conjugated to a pair (F, T ), where F is a period of a certain rank,\n[F, T ] 6= 1, and |T | \u2264 3|F |. According to Lemma 2.6 there exists b1 , b2 \u2208 hF, T i\nsuch that b1 , b2 freely generate the subgroup hb1 , b2 i and\nmax{|b1 |{F,T } , |b2 |{F,T } } \u2264 N,\nwhere N depends on k and h only (it is easy to calculate the lengths of b1 and b2\nexactly, but this is not our goal here). Therefore, there exists x1 , x2 \u2208 hBAls , Bi\nsuch that x1 , x2 freely generate the subgroup hx1 , x2 i and\nmax{|x1 |{BAls ,B} , |x2 |{BAls ,B} } \u2264 N.\nn\n2.\n\nPassing to generators A and B, we obtain\n\u0010n\n\u0011\nmax{|x1 |{A,B} , |x2 |{A,B} } \u2264 N\n+1 .\n2\nTherefore taking into account (2.7) and (2.8), we obtain the following estimates for\nthe elements yi = Qxi Q\u22121 , i = 1, 2,\nClearly we can assume ls <\n\nmax{|y1 |{C k ,W } , |y2 |{C k ,W } } \u2264 4 max{|x1 |{A,B} , |x2 |{A,B} } \u2264 N (2n + 4).\nFinally we set zi = P \u22121 yi P for i = 1, 2. Combining (2.6), (2.4), and (2.3), we\nobtain\nmax{|z1 |{a,b} , |z2 |{a,b} } \u2264 2n(2n + 4)N.\n\n\fUNIFORM NON\u2013AMENABILITY OF FREE BURNSIDE GROUPS\n\n7\n\nAs the pair (z1 , z2 ) is conjugated to (x1 , x2 ), the elements z1 , z2 form the basis\nof free Burnside group of exponent n. To conclude the proof it suffices to set\nM = 2n(2n + 4)N .\n\u0003\nRemark. It should be noted that Ivanov announced the following stronger\nresult in [14]. Given any n odd and large enough, and m \u2265 2, there exist words\nu(x, y), v(x, y) over the alphabet {x, y} such that if a, b are two non\u2013commuting\nelements of B(m, n), then u(a, b), v(a, b) generate freely a free Burnside subgroup\nof B(m, n). Unfortunately the proof of this result has never been written.\n3. Sufficient conditions for uniform non\u2013amenability\nDefinition 3.1. Suppose that G is a group with a given finite set of generators X,\nY a subset of G. The depth of Y with respect to X is defined by\ndepthX (Y ) = max |y|X .\ny\u2208Y\n\nLemma 3.2. Suppose that G is a group, H is a subgroup of G, X and Y are finite\ngenerating sets of G and H respectively. Then we have\n(3.1)\n\n\u03b1(G, X) \u2265\n\n\u03b1(H, Y )\n.\ndepthX (Y )\n\nProof. In order to prove (3.1), we have to show that for any vector f \u2208 L2 (G)\nof norm one, there exists an element x \u2208 X \u00b11 such that\n(3.2)\n\nkxf \u2212 f k \u2265\n\n\u03b1(H, Y )\n.\ndepthX (Y )\n\nAs usual we denote by Hs the right coset representing by s. Let us fix a (unique)\nelement s in each right coset and denote by S the obtained system of representatives.\nGiven a function f \u2208 L2 (G), for every s \u2208 S, we introduce a new function\n\u001a\nf (g), if g \u2208 Hs,\nfs (g) =\n0,\nif g \u2208\n/ Hs.\nIf fs 6= 0, we set\n(3.3)\n\nfs\nf \u0303s =\n.\nkfs k\n\nObviously the norm of f \u0303s is equal to 1 whenever fs 6= 0. It is also clear that\nX\nf=\nfx .\ns\u2208S\n\nFurther, to each fs , s \u2208 S, we assign a function hs \u2208 L2 (H) by the rule\nhs (g) = f \u0303s (gs).\n\nNote that khs k = kf \u0303s k = 1. Therefore, by definition of \u03b1(H, Y ), there is an element\ny \u2208 Y \u00b11 such that\n(3.4)\n\nkyhs \u2212 hs k \u2265 \u03b1(H, Y ).\n\n\f8\n\nDENIS V. OSIN\n\nOn the other hand, we have\n(3.5)\ns\ns\n\u00112\n\u00112\nP \u0010  \u0303 \u22121\nP \u0010  \u0303 \u22121\n \u0303\n \u0303\n \u0303\nky fs \u2212 fs k =\nfs (y g) \u2212 fs (g) =\nfs (y gs) \u2212 f \u0303s (gs) =\ng\u2208Hs\n\nr P\n\ng\u2208H\n\n2\n\n(hs (y \u22121 g) \u2212 hs (g)) = kyhs \u2212 hs k.\n\ng\u2208Hs\n\nCombining (3.3), (3.4), and (3.5) yields\nkyfs \u2212 fs k \u2265 \u03b1(H, Y )kfs k.\n\n(3.6)\n\nNow we observe that the supports of the functions (yfs \u2212fs ) are pairwise disjoint.\nThus fs , s \u2208 S, are pairwise orthogonal and we obtain\nrP\nP\nP\nfs =\nfs \u2212\nkyf \u2212 f k =\ny\nkyfs \u2212 fs k2 \u2265\ns\u2208S\n\ns\u2208S\n\ns\u2208S\n\n(3.7)\n\nrP\nkfs k2 = \u03b1(H, Y ).\n\u03b1(H, Y )\ns\u2208S\n\nAssume that there exists a function f \u2208 L2 (G) that does not satisfy (3.2), i.e.,\nkxf \u2212 f k <\n\n(3.8)\n\n\u03b1(H, Y )\ndepthX (Y )\n\nfor every x \u2208 X \u00b11 . According to the above\u2013mentioned arguments, there exists an\nelement y \u2208 Y satisfying the inequality (3.7). Suppose that y = xd . . . x2 x1 , where\nxd , . . . , x2 , x1 \u2208 X \u00b11 and d \u2264 depthX (Y ). Denote by wi the i \u2212 th suffix of the\nword xd . . . x2 x1 , i.e., the word xi . . . x2 x1 , and set w0 = 1 for convenience. The\ninequality (3.8) implies\nkyf \u2212 f k =\n\nd\u22121\nP\n\n(wi+1 f \u2212 wi f ) \u2264\n\ni=0\n\nkxi+1 wi f \u2212 wi f k =\n\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\nd\u22121\nP\n\nd\u22121\nP\n\nkxi+1 f \u2212 f k < d *\n\n\u03b1(H,Y )\ndepthX (Y )\n\n\u2264 \u03b1(H, Y ).\n\nThis contradicts to (3.7). The theorem is proved. \u0003\nCorollary 3.3. Suppose that H is a non\u2013amenable group with a given set of generators Y , G is a finitely generated group. Assume that for every finite generating\nset X of G there exists an embedding \u03b9 : H \u2192 G such that\ndepthX (\u03b9(Y )) \u2264 D,\nwhere the constant D is independent of X. Then the group G is uniformly non\u2013\namenable.\nExample 3.4. Any infinite hyperbolic group is uniformly non\u2013amenable. Indeed, by the result of Koubi [15], we can apply the Corollary 3.3 for H = F2 , the\nfree group of rank 2.\n\n\fUNIFORM NON\u2013AMENABILITY OF FREE BURNSIDE GROUPS\n\n9\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Recall that the group B(2, n) is non\u2013amenable for all odd\nn > 665. To prove the theorem it is sufficient to refer to Theorem 2.7 and Corollary\n3.3.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] S.I.
