In the J, K bands we find identical slopes for the LMC and Milky Way PL relations and\nonly a weak metallicity effect on the zero points (consistent with a zero effect), metal poor stars being fainter. In the optical we find\nthe Milky Way slopes are slightly shallower than the LMC slopes (but again consistent with no difference in the slopes) and small\neffects on the zero points. However, the important Wesenheit index in V, (V \u2212 I) shows a metallicity effect on the slope and on the zero\npoint which is likely to be significant.\nConclusions. We find a significant metallicity effect on the WVI index \u03b3(WVI ) = \u22120.23 \u00b1 0.10 mag dex\u22121 as well as an effect on the\nslope. The K-band PL relation on the other hand is found to be an excellent extragalactic standard candle being metallicity insensitive\nin both slope and zero-point and at the same time being reddening insensitive and showing the least internal dispersion.\nKey words.

Introduction\nThe Cepheid Period-Luminosity (PL-) Relation is fundamental\nto the calibration of the extra-galactic distance scale and thus to\nthe determination of the Hubble constant. Modern reviews on\nthe calibration of the Cepheid distance scale can be found in e.g.\nFreedman and Madore (1991), Fouqu\u00e9 et al. (2003), Sandage\nand Tammann (2006), Fouqu\u00e9 et al. (2007), and Barnes (2009)\nwhile Freedman and Madore (2010) review the present status\n\u22c6\nBased on observations collected at the European Organisation\nfor Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile,\nProgramme-IDs 076-C.0158, 078.D-0299, & 080.D-0318\n\u22c6\u22c6\nTable 2 is only available in electronic form at the CDS\nvia anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via\nhttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/\n\nof the quest for the Hubble constant. A dissenting view can be\nfound e.g. in Sandage et al. (2009) and references therein.\nThe value of the PL relation rests with its universality, in\nparticular that the PL relation slope and zero points are independent of metallicity. The zero point has long been suggested\nto be metallicity dependent and the HST Key Project on the\nExtragalactic Distance Scale (Freedman et al. 2001) corrected\nfor this based on the empirical studies available at that time (e.g.\nFreedman and Madore 1990, Sasselov et al. 1997, Kochanek\n1997, Kennicutt et al. 1998) with an estimated effect in the\nWVI index of \u22120.2 \u00b1 0.2 mag dex\u22121 in the sense that metal-poor\nCepheids are fainter than metal-rich Cepheids. However, the size\nand even the sign of the effect is still disputed. Udalski et al.\n(2001) found no effect on the slope nor on the zero-point when\ncomparing the metal-poor Cepheids of IC1613 with those in the\nMagellanic Clouds based on TRGB distances to those galax-\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Storm et al.: Calibrating the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation from the infrared surface brightness technique\n\nies. On the other hand Romaniello et al. (2008) found a significant effect with the opposite sign when comparing Milky Way\nand Magellanic Cloud Cepheids with individual spectroscopic\nmetallicity determinations. Sakai et al. (2004) and Storm et al.\n(2004), found an effect of similar size and sign as that adopted\nby the HST key project, but the latter study also showed a significant difference in the slopes of the Milky Way and LMC relations, as also found by Sandage, Tammann, and Reindl (2004).\nRecently Bono et al. (2010) have argued for no significant effect\nin the WVI and W JK index on the basis of empirical as well as\ntheoretical arguments.\nObservationally, we are in the dilemma of either using a large\nsample of Cepheids, like in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),\nwhich constrains very well the slope of the relation for a low\nmetallicity sample of stars and which leaves the zero point to\nbe determined from secondary indicators, or of using direct geometric distances (parallaxes) to a handful of nearby, solar metallicity, Milky Way Cepheids which constrain well the zero point\nof the PL relation but which do not constrain the slope very well.\nBaade-Wesselink type methods which use the pulsational\nproperties of the Cepheids to determine direct distances to individual Cepheids promise to resolve this dilemma by yielding direct individual distances to a large sample of Milky Way\nand Magellanic Cloud Cepheids spanning a significant range of\nmetallicities. In particular, the near-infrared surface brightness\n(IRSB) method (Fouqu\u00e9 & Gieren, 1997), a near-infrared variant of the Barnes-Evans method (Barnes and Evans, 1976) shows\ngreat promise in achieving this goal as it is insensitive to reddening errors. The technique has also been shown to be independent of the metallicity of the Cepheids (Storm et al. 2004).\nA few years ago the IRSB method was re-calibrated using interferometrically measured, phase-resolved angular diameters of\nCepheids by Kervella et al. (2004). This was an extremely important achievement as it proved that the pulsating Cepheid variables indeed obey the same surface brightness-colour relation as\nthe stable yellow giant stars which were used to construct the\nsurface brightness-colour relation adopted in the original calibration of the technique (Fouqu\u00e9 & Gieren, 1997). The improved\nversion of the IRSB technique was then applied to Milky Way\nCepheids by Storm et al. (2004) and Groenewegen (2008), and\nfor the first time to extragalactic Cepheids by Storm et al. (2004)\n(SMC) and Gieren et al. (2005a) (LMC).\nIn our earlier application of the method to Milky Way\nCepheids (Storm et al. 2004), we found that the slopes of the\nresulting PL relations in all optical and near-infrared bands were\nsignificantly steeper than the those directly observed in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud by the OGLE Project and by Persson et al.\n(2004), thus challenging the universality of the PL relation.\nGieren et al. (2005a) then analyzed thirteen LMC Cepheids, for\nwhich the data required for the IRSB analysis were available at\nthe time, in an identical fashion and found that the PL relation\nslopes in the LMC were very similar to the one obtained for\nthe Milky Way sample, but different from the observed apparent\nslope of the LMC sample. We interpreted this as evidence for\nthe existence of an as yet undetected period-dependent systematic error in the IRSB method, but the limited size of the LMC\nsample prevented firm conclusions.\nTo put our previous analysis on a firmer basis, we present in\nthe present paper new and very accurate radial velocity curves\nfor 22 additional LMC Cepheids (Sec.2) thus almost tripling\nthe existing sample for an IRSB analysis to a total of 36 stars.\nTo allow a purely differential comparison with solar metallicity Cepheids we present a similar analysis for 77 Milky Way\nCepheids in an accompanying paper (Storm et al. 2011, here-\n\nTable 1.

This is a typical set of photometric light and\ncolour curves in the present study based on the optical photometry from OGLE-III (Udalski et al., 2008, Soszy\u0144ski et al. 2008),\nand the near-IR photometry from Persson et al. (2004).\ninafter Paper I). In that paper we also combine the new empirical constraints on the projection (p-)factor, converting Cepheid\nradial into pulsational velocities, as obtained from the present\nLMC study and the recent HST parallax measurements to ten\nGalactic Cepheids (Benedict et al. 2007), to obtain a new empirical calibration of the p-factor relation to be used in our IRSB\ndistance analysis.\nIn Sec.3 We briefly describe the IRSB method in its present\nform and we discuss the choice of the p-factor relation. We\npresent the resulting LMC Period-Luminosity relations in optical and near-infrared bands in Sec.4 where we also compare to\nthe SMC and Milky Way samples to estimate the effect of metallicity on the PL relations. In Sec.5 we discuss our results and\ncompare them to other recent investigations. Sec.6 summarizes\nour results.\n\n2. The Data\n2.1. The LMC Cepheid sample\n\nWe have selected 22 Cepheids in the LMC (see Tab.1) showing a wide range of periods, all having high-quality near-IR\nlightcurves from Persson et al. (2004) and very accurate optical photometry from OGLE-III (Udalski et al. 2008, Soszy\u0144ski\net al. 2008). From their optical lightcurves, all these Cepheids\nare clearly fundamental mode pulsators. For these stars we have\nobtained radial velocity curves as will be described in the next\nsection. A typical data set (HV 2282) is shown in Fig.1.\n\n\fJ. Storm et al.: Calibrating the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation from the infrared surface brightness technique\n\nGieren et al. (2005a) performed a first IRSB analysis on a\nsample of 13 Cepheids in the LMC, six of which belonging\nto the young blue, massive cluster NGC1866. These stars will\nall be used in the following analysis. To this sample we have\nadded the star HV2827. The radial velocity data for this star\ncomes from Imbert et al. (1987), the optical photometry from\nMoffet et al. (1998) and the near-IR photometry from Persson\net al. (2004). For all the stars we have transformed the near-IR\nphotometry to the SAAO system using first the transformations\ngiven by Persson et al. (2004) to transform the LCO data to the\nCTIO system, and then applying the transformations given by\nCarter (1990) to transform from the CTIO to the SAAO system.\nIn this way we ensure to be on a common system with the Milky\nWay sample presented in the accompanying Paper I, and to be on\nthe same photometric system which was used by Kervella et al.\n(2004) for the calibration of the surface-brightness versus colour\nrelation.\n2.2. Spectroscopic data\n\nUsing the HARPS instrument on the ESO 3.6m telescope and\nthe FEROS instrument on the ESO/MPG 2.2m telescope, both\nat ESO La Silla, Chile, we have obtained 509 new radial velocity measurements for the above described sample of 22 LMC\nCepheids. HARPS was used for 20 of the stars while FEROS\nwas used for two additional Cepheids, HV914 and HV12717.\nHARPS (Mayor et al. 2003) is a fiber-fed cross-dispersed\nechelle spectrograph mounted inside a vacuum vessel for improved wavelength stability. It has a spectral resolution of R =\n115000 (3.2 pix) and the wavelength range reaches from 380\nto 690nm. HARPS was used to observe 20 LMC Cepheids in\nthe sample. Radial velocity observations were obtained during a\nsingle, 16-night, visitor observing run in December 2005 which\nwere later complemented with service mode observations in the\nfollowing two seasons to cover phase gaps in the velocity curves.\nWe used the standard reduction pipeline using crosscorrelation with a G2-type spectral mask (Baranne et al. 1996,\nPepe et al. 2002) to extract radial velocities from the spectral\ndata.\nFEROS (Kaufer et al. 1999) is also a fiber-fed crosseddispersed spectrograph. It has a resolution of R = 48000\n(2.2 pix) covering the wavelength range from 360 to 920nm.\nThe Cepheid radial velocities were extracted using the crosscorrelation method with the FEROS pipeline.\nBoth instruments are known to be very stable with wavelength drifts well below 100 m/s. As our main objective was to\nobtain well covered, accurate radial velocity curves we made relatively short exposures with resulting low signal to noise ratios\nof 5 to 10. This was found sufficient to keep the errors of the\nindividual radial velocity measurements below 100 m/s, which\nmeets the precision we desired.\nThe Heliocentric Julian dates and the individual radial velocities are tabulated in Tab.2 and the radial velocity curves are plotted in Fig.2. A few data points appear to be mis-identifications\nas they are close to the systemic velocity of the star but do not\nfall on the velocity curve (see HV873, HV878, and U1). They\nhave been marked with crosses in the figure and are not considered in the further analysis. In the case of HV1005 we found two\npoints with similar offsets from the radial velocity curve. These\ntwo data points were obtained two years later than the majority\nof the data, obtained during the sixteen consecutive nights (see\nabove), thus suggesting the possibility of orbital motion for this\nstar. We have simply disregarded those two points in the following analysis.\n\n3\n\nTable 2.

The IRSB method\n3.1. The surface brightness-colour relation\n\nThe infrared surface brightness (IRSB) method is a variant of the\nBaade-Wesselink method originally developed by Barnes and\nEvans (1976) in the optical spectral range. It matches the angular\ndiameter variation of a Cepheid as determined from photometry,\nwith the radius variation of the pulsating star as determined from\nan integration of its pulsational velocity curve.\nIn Paper I we present a more detailed discussion of the\nmethod, which relates the surface brightness parameter, FV , to\na colour index (V \u2212 K)0 to determine the angular diameter variation of the star.\nHere we use the relation\nFV = 4.2207 \u2212 0.1V0 \u2212 0.5 log \u03b8\n= \u22120.1336(V \u2212 K)0 + 3.9530\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nas determined by Kervella et al. (2004).\n3.2. The projection factor\n\nKnowledge of the projection (p-) factor which converts an observed radial velocity of a Cepheid into the pulsational velocity\nat its surface is crucial for any kind of Baade-Wesselink analysis. The p-factor has to take into account not only the geometrical projection effects across the observed stellar disk but also\nfold this with the effect of limb darkening and possibly take into\nconsideration non-LTE effects due to the dynamic behaviour of\nthe pulsating atmosphere.\nRecent empirical (Gieren et al., 2005a) and theoretical\n(Nardetto et al., 2007 & 2009) work has shown that the p-factor\nrelation from Hindsley and Bell (1989), which shows a slight\nperiod dependence of the p-factor and was used in our early\nwork (Gieren et al. 1993), is not appropriate. In fact the new\ndata presented here (see Sec.4.3) largely supports the empirical findings of Gieren et al. (2005a) that the p-factor depends\nquite strongly on pulsational period or the derived distances to\nthe LMC Cepheids become period dependent, which is clearly\nunphysical. We have discussed this issue in more detail in Paper\nI. In that paper, we find the best fitting relation to be:\np = 1.550(\u00b10.04) \u2212 0.186(\u00b10.06) log P\n\n(3)\n\nwhich we will adopt here.\nIt is important to note that the exact choice of the p-factor\nrelation has no bearing on the conclusions regarding the effect\nof metallicity on the PL relations in the present paper, as long\nas the p-factor relation used in the analysis is the same for both\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

The IRSB-based distance moduli of 36 Cepheids in the\nLMC using the new p-factor relation derived in Paper I, plotted\nas a function of their pulsation period. The moduli have been\nreferred to the LMC barycenter using the LMC disk model of\nvan der Marel and Cioni (2001).\nsamples, the Milky Way and the LMC. Any change in the relation would affect both Milky Way and LMC Cepheids in the\nsame way but the differentials would remain the same. This of\ncourse is based on the implicit assumption that the p-factor is independent of metallicity. Work is currently underway to further\ninvestigate this point.\n3.3. The reddening\n\nThe reddenings for the LMC stars were taken from the catalogue\nof Persson et al. (2004) whenever possible. For the NGC1866\nstars we adopted values of E(B \u2212 V) = 0.06 following the discussion in Storm et al. (2005). The reddening is very low for\nall the stars and the star-to-star variation is very low as well, so\nreddening errors can only marginally affect the resulting PeriodLuminosity relations, even in the optical bands. We have adopted\nthe reddening law from Cardelli et al. (1989) with a total-toselective absorption of RV = 3.23 following the discussion in\nFouqu\u00e9 et al. (2007). In this way we are proceeding exactly in\nthe same way as for the Milky Way Cepheids in Paper I.\n3.4. Adopted metallicity\n\nWe adopt the mean metallicity estimates for the Milky Way,\nLMC and SMC Cepheids from the discussion by Luck et al.\n(1998) based on new and literature measures for Cepheids and\nsupergiants. They find for the Milky Way [Fe/H] = +0.03 based\non 69 stars with \u03c3 = 0.14, for the LMC [Fe/H] = \u22120.34 based\non 32 stars with \u03c3 = 0.15 and for the SMC [Fe/H] = \u22120.68\nbased on 25 stars with \u03c3 = 0.13. These values are largely\nsupported by Romaniello et al. (2008) who found values of\n\u22120.30 dex and \u22120.75 dex respectively. We note that the Cepheids\nin NGC1866 might be slightly more metal-poor, [Fe/H] = \u22120.5,\nbased on the spectroscopic study of three cluster giants by Hill\net al. (2000) and the photometric measurement for NGC1866 of\n\u22120.48 \u00b10.18 by Hilker et al. (1995) from Str\u00f6mgren photometry,\nbut we do not make this distinction in the following.\n\n\fJ.

Results\n4.1. Distances and absolute magnitudes\n\nWe have applied the IRSB method as described in the previous section to find the distances and absolute magnitudes for\nthe LMC Cepheids reported in Tab.3 and for the SMC sample\nof Storm et al. (2004) in Tab.4. The absolute magnitudes are\nintensity-averaged magnitudes.\n4.2. The distances to the LMC and the SMC\n\nOn the basis of the individual distances to the Cepheids in the\nLMC we can now determine the distance to the LMC barycenter. First we correct the measured distance of each Cepheid\nby the distance offset from the LMC disk model of van der\nMarel & Cioni (2001) as tabulated in the last column of Tab.3\nand then compute the mean of the resulting values. We find\n(m \u2212 M)0 (LMC) = 18.45 \u00b1 0.04 (random error only) with a standard deviation of 0.22 mag. As the Cepheids are well distributed\nacross the face of the LMC the uncorrected mean modulus is\nidentical to within 0.01 mag to the adopted barycentric distance\nmodulus value.\nFor the SMC we only have five stars so the random error is\nsignificantly larger than is the case for the LMC. Additionally,\nthe SMC is well known to exhibit more pronounced depth effects than the LMC, so some additional scatter is to be expected.\nWe find from the five Cepheids an unweighted mean value of\n(m \u2212 M)0 (SMC) = 18.92 \u00b1 0.14 with a standard deviation of\n0.32 mag. The offset in modulus with respect to the LMC of\n0.47 mag is in excellent agreement with the very accurate value\nof 0.44\u00b10.05 mag found by Cioni et al. (2000) from an investigation of a large sample of tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB) stars\nin the reddening insensitive near-infrared, thus giving us confidence that our five stars are indeed representative of the SMC as\na whole.\n4.3. Constraints on the p-factor relation\n\nAs discussed in Sec.3.2 we can use the IRSB distances to the\n36 LMC Cepheids to place constraints on the p-factor relation.\nWe have rederived the distances to the individual LMC Cepheids\nusing different p-factor relations, as discussed in more detail in\nPaper I, and we computed the individual LMC barycentric distances as before. In Tab.5 we list the resulting mean LMC distance moduli as well as the slope of the distance modulus as a\nfunction of pulsation period, for each of the p-factor relations\nwe tested in this process. The function distance modulus versus pulsation period must of course have a zero slope, and with\nthe present large sample of 36 stars we are able to place strong\nconstrains on the slope. In the table it can be seen that the original Hindsley and Bell (1989) relation gives a very plausible\nLMC distance but a strong and unphysical period dependence\n\nFig. 4. The K-band period-luminosity relation for our sample\nof LMC Cepheids based on the absolute magnitudes determined\nwith the IRSB method as calibrated in Paper I. The best fitting\nline from the data is overplotted in black, and the best fitting line\nto the Milky Way sample of Paper I is overplotted with a dashed\nline in red. It is appreciated that the LMC and Milky Way PL\nrelations agree extremely well both in slope and zero point.\nof the distance moduli. Similarly the Nardetto et al. (2009) relation gives a slope which deviates at the level of 2\u03c3 from the\nuncorrelated relation and the LMC distance becomes uncomfortably short at 18.26 mag. The third relation uses the slope of\nthe p-factor relation from Nardetto et al. (2009) but with a zero\npoint which yields IRSB distances to Milky Way Cepheids in\nagreement with the recent parallaxes from Benedict et al. (2007).\nThe last column corresponds to the relation derived in Paper I\nwhich we have adopted here, which yields LMC Cepheid distance moduli which are totally independent of their pulsation period. This is borne out in Fig.3 where we show the LMC center\ndistance moduli based on the individual LMC Cepheid moduli\ncorrected for the disk model of van der Marel and Cioni (2001)\nas a function of log P. It is evident that with the adopted p-factor\nrelation there is no significant correlation between pulsational\nperiod and derived distance to the LMC Cepheids.\n4.4. The LMC Period-Luminosity relations\n\nIn Tab.6 the Period-Luminosity relations we obtain for the LMC\nin the different photometric bands are given in the form:\nM = a(\u00b1\u03c3(a))[log(P) \u2212 1.0] + b(\u00b1\u03c3(b))\n\n(4)\n\nThe relations have been determined from a linear regression\nto the absolute magnitudes and log(P) values given in Tab.3. In\nthe table the corresponding relations for the Milky Way sample\ndetermined in Paper I are given for comparison. These relations\nare based on Cepheid distances calculated with exactly the same\nprecepts as in this paper, using the same p-factor relation and\nIRSB calibration so we can perform a direct comparison of the\nrelations. The relations in the K- and V-bands as well as in the\nV, (V \u2212 I) Wesenheit index are shown in Figs.4-6 with the Milky\nWay relations overplotted.\nThe dispersions of the Milky Way and LMC samples around\nthe ridge line PL relations given in Tab.6 are very similar for\nall the bands, and we note that there is not a big difference in\n\n\fJ.

The J and Kband values are only marginally smaller than those for the optical bands and the WVI index performs only slightly better than\nthe V-band. If however we consider the LMC Cepheids to be at\nthe same distance we can determine apparent PL relations without involving the individual distances from the IRSB method. In\nthis case the dispersion reduces in WVI from 0.24 to 0.15 mag,\nin V from 0.26 to 0.19 mag and in the K-band the value even\ndecreases from 0.21 to 0.09 mag. Removing only two stars from\nthe WVI relation further reduces that disperion to 0.09 mag illustrating that the uncertainty on these numbers are quite large\ndue to the small sample size. The fact that the dispersion can\nbe reduced so much by adopting a common distance to all the\nstars suggests that the observed dispersion in the PL relations is\ndominated by errors in the distance moduli rather than intrinsic\ndispersion in the luminosities or reddening errors and the standard error on the individual distance moduli is about 0.2 mag.\n\nMJ\n(mag)\n\u22125.41\n\u22125.56\n\u22125.60\n\u22126.20\n\u22125.89\n\nMK\n(mag)\n\u22125.88\n\u22125.95\n\u22126.00\n\u22126.63\n\u22126.33\n\nWVI\n(mag)\n\u22125.96\n\u22126.12\n\u22126.20\n\u22126.84\n\u22126.67\n\nWJK\n(mag)\n\u22126.20\n\u22126.21\n\u22126.28\n\u22126.92\n\u22126.64\n\nE(B \u2212 V)\n(mag)\n0.030\n0.090\n0.000\n0.070\n0.030\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n0.025\n\u22120.055\n0.020\n\u22120.005\n\u22120.010\n\nThe dispersion of the LMC and MW samples are also very\nsimilar suggesting that the LMC data quality is equal to that for\nthe Milky Way sample. Barnes et al. (2005) performed a careful\nBayesian analysis of the data presented in Storm et al. (2004) and\nfound that the formal error estimates from the regression fitting,\nwhich are also the errors tabulated here in Tab.3, were systematically underestimated. On average these errors should be multiplied by a factor of 3.4 to be in agremeent with the Bayesian\nerror estimates. In fact the error estimates for the distance moduli presented in Tab.3 have a mean value of 0.051 mag, which\nresults in a revised mean error estimate of 0.17 mag, very similar to the standard error of 0.2 mag estimated above from the\nK-band PL relation.\n4.5.

It can be seen that especially in the limited\nbut for extragalactic distance determination most important metallicity range from LMC to solar abundance, the zero point offsets\nare in general indistinguishable from zero.\n\nFig. 5.

Since the slopes of the PL relations for both LMC\nand Milky Way Cepheids are very well constrained from our\nsamples, we conclude that our results present strong evidence\nthat the slope of the Cepheid PL relation, particularly in the\nnear-infrared J and K bands, is identical for the solar metallicity\nMilky Way and more metal-poor LMC samples. These PL relations are thus independent of metallicity in the range from solar\nto LMC metallicity. The universality of the PL relation slopes\nappears to be confirmed in this metallicity range.\nWe can further extend the metallicity baseline by including\nthe 5 SMC Cepheids in the sample. Given the low number of\nCepheids and the narrow range of periods for these stars, we\ncannot constrain the slope of the PL relation at this metallicty,\nbut we can constrain the zero point offset. In Fig.7 we have overplotted the SMC Cepheids on the LMC Cepheids for the K-band\nand obviously there is good agreement. Considering the excellent agreement between the LMC and the Milky Way from Tab.6\nthis further supports the universality of the zero point of the Kband relation.\nWe can quantify any offsets in the PL relation magnitude\nzero points as a function of metallicity by comparing the zero\npoint offset for each of the three samples with the reference\nPL relations determined in Paper I on the basis of all available\nCepheids. For each band and sample we computed the mean\nmagnitude offsets, tabulated them in Tab.7 and plotted them as\na function of metallicity in Fig.8. For each band we have fit the\nweighted least square regression line to the magnitude offset as\na function of metallicity. The resulting metallicity effect slopes\nhave been tabulated in Tab.7. We estimate the error on the slopes\nto be of the order 0.10 mag dex\u22121 based on the error bars on the\nindividual points and the fact that the baseline is smaller than one\ndex. From the Fig.8 and Tab.7 it can be seen that a zero metallicity effect cannot be ruled out by the data in most cases but\nthat the effect is significant and the strongest for the WVI index.\nFor extra-galactic distance determination most Cepheid samples\nwill have metallicities in the range from LMC to solar and the\nzero-point offsets in this range is clearly very small in all the\nbands.\nThe only bands for which we have excellent agreement between the PL relation slopes are the J and K bands, and the zeropoint offsets in both of these bands are small so they each form\nan excellent basis for a standard candle. In the V band and the\nW JK index the PL relation slopes are marginally in agreement\nand also for these two bands the zero-point offsets are small.\nThe I band and the WVI index have significant differences in the\nPL slopes. The WVI index zero-point is also significantly more\nmetallicity dependent than is the case for the other bands making this index inferior to the J and K-bands as a standard candle.\nWe note that we have assumed a simple linear metallicity\ndependence, but it is of course entirely possible that the dependence, if present, has a more complex functional form.\nWe emphasize that the metallicity effect on both the slopes\nand zero points discussed here is entirely independent of the\nchoice of the p-factor relation, whereas the absolute values of\nthe slopes and zero points as well as the resulting LMC and SMC\ndistances do depend on the adopted p-factor relation.\n\n\f10\n\nJ. Storm et al.: Calibrating the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation from the infrared surface brightness technique\n\n5. Discussion\nWe can now compare the slopes of our LMC PL relations with\nindependent measures from apparant magnitudes versus log(P).\nIn the near-infrared we use the relations from Persson et al.\n(2004) which is based on 92 LMC Cepheids with excellent J\nand K light curves. They found slopes of \u22123.261 \u00b1 0.042 and\n\u22123.153 \u00b1 0.051 in K and J respectively, in excellent agreement\nwith our values of \u22123.28 \u00b1 0.09 and \u22123.22 \u00b1 0.09. In the optical\nwe can compare to the relations from the OGLE project (Udalski\n2000) and we similarly find very good agreement. They find in\nthe V and I-bands slopes of \u22122.775 \u00b1 0.031 and \u22122.977 \u00b1 0.021,\nto be compared with our values of \u22122.78 \u00b1 0.11 and \u22123.02 \u00b1 0.10\nrespectively. The fact that we reproduce the slopes of the PL relations in the LMC so well strongly supports our empirical calibration of the p-factor used with the IRSB method and confirms\nour earlier results (Gieren et al. 2005a) based on a much smaller\nsample of LMC Cepheids.\nThe LMC distance modulus of 18.45 \u00b1 0.04 is only slightly\nshorter than the \"canonical\" value of 18.50 \u00b1 0.10 as adopted\nby Freedman et al. (2001) and by the ARAUCARIA project\n(Gieren et al. 2005b, Pietrzy\u0144ski et al. 2010a), and slightly\nlonger than the value of 18.39 \u00b10.01(random) \u00b10.07(systematic)\nsuggested by Freedman and Madore (2010) in their recent review. It is thus in good agreement with most recent results, as\nwould be expected considering that we (see Paper I) have calibrated the IRSB method to match the distances to nine Milky\nWay Cepheids with direct parallaxes from Benedict et al. (2007).\nThese distances are accurate to 4-10%, which seems the largest\nsingle remaining systematic uncertainty in the IRSB method assuming that the p-factor relation has been accurately established\nfrom our new and improved constraints (which is supported by\nthe arguments given above). The total systematic uncertainty of\nour present determination of the LMC distance is difficult to\nquantify, but expected to be about \u00b1 5%, which is better than\nmost other techniques which have been used to measure the\nLMC distance over the years. An exciting possibility to constrain the IRSB method even further, in a very direct way, will\nbe the comparison of the IRSB-determined distance to the LMC\nCepheid OGLE-LMC-CEP0227 which is a member in a doublelined eclipsing binary system (Pietrzynski et al. 2010b). Work is\nunderway to determine the distance to this binary from orbital\nanalysis.\nIn Sec.4.5 we compared the slopes of the PL relations from\nthe Milky Way and LMC samples finding insignificant differences in the near-IR bands and small (but possibly also nonsignificant) differences in the optical bands. This result is in good\nagreement with the findings by Gieren et al. (2005a) but at odds\nwith earlier findings by us (Fouqu\u00e9, Storm and Gieren, 2003,\nStorm et al. 2004) where we found that the slope of the galactic\nrelations were significantly steeper than those in the LMC and\nSMC. The reason for this difference was the inappropriate pfactor relation used in the earlier work for determining the Milky\nWay PL relations. Note that in the present work the choice of\nthe p-factor relation has no bearing on the difference in slope\nbetween the Milky Way and LMC PL relations as we are now\napplying the method to both samples of Cepheids, this was not\npossible previously as the necessary data for the LMC stars was\nnot yet available. Sandage, Tammann, and Reindel (2004) also\nargued that there is a significant difference in slope between the\nMilky Way and LMC PL relations in the optical bands, the Milky\nWay relation being steeper. This conclusion was largely based on\nthese older IRSB results, as well as on Cepheids in OB associations from Feast (1999). As we show in Paper I the revised IRSB\n\ndistances are, apart from a small zero point offset, in very good\nagreement with the latest results on open cluster Cepheids from\nTurner (2010) and does not exhibit a period dependence.\nWe do not support the conclusion of a strong effect of metallicity on the slope of optical (V, I) Cepheid PL relations as\nreached, for example, by Tammann et al. (2011) or Storm et al.\n(2004), in fact we find that for these bands the Milky Way PL\nrelations are slightly shallower than the LMC relations, only for\nthe W JK index we find that the Milky Way relation is steeper than\nthe LMC relation.\nIn Tab.7 we summarized the PL relation zero point variation as a function of metallicity. We have made the simplest assumption of a linear relation and found the slopes of the zero\npoint offset versus metallicity relations, \u03b3. Clearly the effects\nin the near-IR are small and even in the V band the effect appears to be small, albeit with the opposite sign as for the other\nbands. The largest effect we find is in the WVI index and our\nvalue of \u03b3(WVI ) = \u22120.23 \u00b1 0.10 mag dex\u22121 is in excellent agreement with the value of \u22120.24 \u00b1 0.05 mag dex\u22121 found by Sakai et\nal. (2004) and other measurements which have been adopted in\nthe recent review paper by Freedman and Madore (2010). This\nresult is slightly at odds with the findings of Bono et al. (2010)\nwho on the basis of data on 48 external galaxies finds no significant metallicity effect on neither slope nor zero point for the\nWesenheits indices WVI and W JK . At the same time we do agree\nwith them that the PL relation slopes are less affected in the J\nand K-bands and more affected in the optical V and I bands and\nwe also agree on the most likely sign of the effect namely that\nmetal-rich PL relations are shallower than metal-poor ones.\nIt is interesting to note that the most significant metallicity effect is found for the WVI index and that this effect can\nlargely be attributed to the colour difference between Milky Way\nand LMC Cepheids as found by Sandage, Tamman and Reindl\n(2004). They compared period-colour relations for both Milky\nWay and LMC Cepheids and found that the LMC Cepheids for\na given period are bluer by about 0.05 mag. Feeding this into the\nWesenheits index (WVI = V \u2212 2.54(V \u2212 I)), we find an offset\nof 0.00 \u2212 2.54 \u00d7 \u22120.05 = 0.13 mag in the case where the offset\nis fully in the I-band and \u22120.05 \u2212 2.54 \u00d7 \u22120.05 = 0.08 mag in\nthe case where the effect is fully in the V-band. Disregarding\nthe subtle effects of differences in the slopes of the periodcolour relations, these results are comparable to the offset of\n0.09 mag, metal-poor Cepheids being fainter, which we find between the Milky Way and LMC WVI relations in Tab.6 at a period\nof 10 days.\nThe emerging conclusion based on our data and analysis is\nthat for accurate distance measurements to galaxies the K-band\nCepheid PL relation is the best suited tool: it is metallicityindependent both regarding the slope and the zero point, it is\nvery insensitive to reddening, and it has a smaller intrinsic dispersion than any optical PL relation. It is likely, as indicated in\nrecent work from Spitzer data, that mid-infrared Cepheid PL relations are even superior to their near-infrared relations because\nof their even lower sensitivity to reddening, and lower intrinsic dispersions (Madore et al. 2009). Yet, their dependence on\nmetallicity has still to be investigated and they cannot be exploited from the ground making them exceedingly expensive to\nuse.\n\n6. Conclusions and Summary\nWe have obtained new and very accurate radial velocity curves\nfor 22 LMC Cepheids thus expanding the sample of LMC\n\n\fJ. Storm et al.: Calibrating the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation from the infrared surface brightness technique\n\nCepheids to 36 for which we can apply the IRSB distance analysis. We have applied the newly calibrated IRSB technique of\nPaper I to these 36 LMC Cepheids as well as to 5 SMC Cepheids.\nThe IRSB analysis yields individual distances from which we\ncalculate absolute magnitudes in optical and near-infrared bands.\nThese magnitudes define tight Period-Luminosity relations in\nthe V, I, J, K bands and in the Wesenheit indices.\nWe show that the PL relations are in excellent agreement\nwith the observed apparent magnitude versus log(P) relations in\nboth the optical and near-IR bands lending strong support to the\nempirical calibration of the p-factor relation in Paper I.\nBy comparing the LMC Cepheid PL relations to their Milky\nWay counterparts reported in Paper I that were established with\nexactly the same precepts, we find practically identical Milky\nWay and LMC PL relation slopes in the near-infrared bands,\narguing for the universality of the Cepheid PL relation in this\nspectral range. The zero points exhibit a slight metallicity effect,\n\u03b3(MK ) = \u22120.10 \u00b1 0.10 mag dex\u22121 in the sense that metal-poor\nCepheids are fainter than metal-rich Cepheids. If we restrict ourselves only to the metallicity range between solar and LMC, our\nresults are consistent with universal PL relations (in both slope\nand zero point) in the near-infrared J and K bands.\nIn the optical bands, we find that the slopes depend weakly\non metallicity, the Milky Way slopes being slightly shallower\nthan the LMC slopes, but this difference might not be significant.\nThe optical PL relation zero points exhibit a metallicity effect\nof similar size as in the near-IR albeit the sign is opposite in the\nV-band. The WVI index shows the strongest zero point effect on\nmetallicity where we find \u03b3(WVI ) = \u22120.23 \u00b1 0.10 mag dex\u22121 .\nWe stress that the zero-point offsets are based on a rather long\nmetallicity baseline ranging from SMC to solar metallicity.\nOur direct distances to the LMC Cepheids leads to a true\nLMC distance modulus of 18.45 \u00b1 0.04 mag, with an estimated\nsystematic uncertainty of 5% which mainly comes from the uncertainty on the HST parallaxes of nine Milky Way Cepheids\nthat have been used to define the absolute zero point of the IRSB\ntechnique. Our distances to the SMC Cepheids leads to an SMC\ndistance of 18.92 \u00b1 0.14.\nBoth the WVI metallicity effect and the LMC distance which\nwe find are in agreement with the latest values adopted by\nFreedman and Madore (2010) in their recent review on the\nHubble constant.\nConsidering the significant metallicity effect on the\nWVI index, not only on the zero-point but most likely also on\nthe slope, we argue that the best standard candle is presently\nprovided by the PL relation in the K-band as it is metallicity insensitive, reddening insensitive and exhibits the lowest intrinsic\nscatter.\nAcknowledgements.
