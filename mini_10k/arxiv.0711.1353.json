We show how Virtual Observatory developments enable a correct use of synthesis models to obtain\naccurate (and not simply precise) results.\nKey words: Synthesis models; Virtual Observatory.\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe aim of the Virtual Observatory (VO) is to provide an\nenvironment to produce more accurate science. Not only\ndoes the VO provide an opportunity for technical developments, it also offers unique possibilities for scientific\nresearch: The VO framework requires an explicit description of the data that it provides with no implicit assumptions about the data themselves. This requirement is fundamental since interoperability is performed by machine\nto machine communications without supervision by human beings. Such a description is performed by the data\n\nFigure 1. IVOA spectrum data model.\nmodel working group in the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA).\nThe rationale of the data model working group is to provide an abstract description of concepts and their interrelationships, used to fix both the names and meanings of\nconcepts in the VO context and also their internal structure and cross-connections (IVOA Spectral Data Model\n1.01, 2007)1, that is to describe all the possible universes\nof classes of data. Note that such description and interrelationships are fundamental in scientific research also,\nwith the only difference that, in the last case, researchers\nare focused on particular types of objects.\nFigure 1 shows the spectrum data model generated by the\ndata model working group. This data model aims to describe all the universe of tables in the VO that contain a\nspectrum, hence the data model must not only be valid\nfor observed data, but also for theoretical spectra.\nThis data model (the generic description of a spectrum)\nallows to formulate new questions for researchers that either produce or use theoretical spectra: Does this data\nmodel describe theoretical spectra? Can all the \"boxes\"\nin the data model be filled? And, if this is the case, what is\nthe accuracy of a theoretical model? Do theoretical models have systematic errors? And, do they have statistical\nerrors?\n1 http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/WD/DM/SpectrumDM-20070515.html\n\n\f2\nfurther information about the observed system can be\nobtained unless additional a priori information is considered. In the case of evolutionary population synthesis\n(Tinsley & Gunn, 1976), the contribution of the different\nstellar classes is defined by the evolutionary status of the\nsystem, hence the knowledge of the contribution of the\ndifferent stellar classes can be transformed into knowledge about the age, metallicity, stellar birth-rate (i.e. star\nformation history, initial mass function and the amount\nof formed stars) of the system. Although evolutionary\nsynthesis models are powerful, it is necessary to take into\naccount that:\n\u2022 The transformation between the contribution of stellar classes and the associated physical parameters\nrequires some a priori hypotheses: a set of atmosphere models, evolutionary tracks and defined star\nformation properties (i.e. stellar birth rate).\n\nFigure 2. Draft illustration of the concepts of the IVOA\ncharacterization data model for a typical atmosphere library like those used in populations synthesis showing\nthe resolution of the library (precision in the VO data\nmodel) and its coverage (support in the VO data model).\nIsochrones are also drawn for an intuitive comparison of\nthe support of both sets of data.\nIn addition to the spectrum data model, this working\ngroup has also proposed a data model for astrophysical\ndataset characterization (IVOA Data Model for Astronomical DataSet Characterization 1.11, 2007)2. This data\nmodel defines the information required to describe the\nparameter space of observed or simulated astronomical\ndatasets. Fig. 2 is a draft illustration of the description of\nan atmosphere library like those used in population synthesis.\nAgain, a correct characterization of models is fundamental for their application to observations. All theoretical\nmodels have a limited range of validity, given by the computational algorithms, the resolution of the input data and\nother factors. Usually, these limitations are described\nqualitatively in the reference papers, but unfortunately,\nit is not so common for these limitations to be introduced in the code that computes the models (Fortunately,\nthere are some significant exceptions, like CLOUDY by\nFerland et al., 1998).\nWe stress again that an answer of the previous issues is\nfundamental in scientific research, since the basic way\nto obtain the physical parameters of an observed system\nis to compare observational data with theoretical models.\nOnly if these questions are solved in a quantitative way,\nwill it be possible to evaluate the accuracy (not the precision) of our knowledge of the observed system.\nIn the case of stellar populations, theoretical models are provided by stellar population synthesis\n(Fanelli, O'Connell & Thuan, 1987; Tinsley & Gunn,\n1976).\nThe general case of population synthesis\naims to decompose the observed light of the system\nunder study in different stellar populations components, that is the contribution of classes of stars, each\nclass with different effective temperature and gravity\n(Fanelli, O'Connell & Thuan, 1987). In this case, no\n2 http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/PR/DM/CharacterisationDM-20070530.html\n\n\u2022 There are different evolutionary conditions that result in the same integrated spectra, so the physical\nparameters obtained from the analysis of observations are not necessarily unique.\nThese a priori hypotheses, together with the computational algorithms and approximations used by different\nsynthesis codes, define the range of use (i.e. characterize) of the results. They are also the principal source of\nsystematic errors in model computations. On the other\nhand, the degeneracy of the possible solutions produces\nan intrinsic precision loss in any fit of observational data\nand theoretical models: the best-fit solutions are not necessarily the correct ones and the distribution of the goodness of fit is also needed for a correct interpretation of the\nobserved data. In order to analyze these issues in detail,\nwe need to understand what a synthesis model is.\n\n2.\n\nWHAT IS A SYNTHESIS MODEL?\n\nThe first step needed to evaluate systematic errors, dispersion and the range of application in population synthesis\nmodels is to understand how synthesis models work. The\nmain result of synthesis models is the luminosity due to\nan ensemble of n individual stars, each with a given luminosity, li . The total luminosity of the ensemble is:\n\nLtot =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n1X\nli = n < l\u0302 > .\nn i=1\nn\n\nli = n\n\n(1)\n\nwhere < l\u0302 > is the estimation of the mean luminosity of\nan individual star.\nHowever, in a system where individual stars are not resolved, we cannot perform such a sum, since we do not\nknow the individual li values. In this case, we can obtain\nthe total luminosity as the composition of different stellar\npopulations (or different stellar types). If we assume that\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 3. Mean spectrum and 90% confidence interval\nregion of clusters with 105 M\u2299 transformed into stars,\nwith a given metallicity and a given age.\n\nFigure 4. Mean spectrum of clusters with 105 M\u2299 transformed into stars, with a given metallicity and a wide\nrange of ages.\n\na given stellar type i can be represented by a luminosity li and we have some rules that give us the proportion\nwi between different stellar types for different physical\nparameters (wi = wi [t, Z, IMF, SFH]), then\n\npossible clusters with this number of stars, and evolutionary conditions. Fig. 4 show the mean spectrum of a cluster with similar conditions but different ages. The 90%\nconfidence interval in Fig. 3, with a single age, covers\nall the region defined by the mean values of the spectra at\ndifferent ages. Any fit of a real spectrum of such a cluster would produce a very precise result for the age, but\nthe accuracy of this fit cannot be known if the underlying probability distributions of integrated luminosities at\ndifferent ages are not taken into account.\n\nLtheo\ntot (n)\n\n=\n\nn\n\nNX\nclass\n\nwi li = n < l >,\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\nNX\nclass\n\nwi = 1.\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere < l > is the mean (or average) luminosity of an\naverage star that represents the ensemble. Note that this\nmean luminosity is not necessarily the luminosity of any\nreal star, but it is a description of an underlying probability distribution of the possibles luminosities of real\nstars in the ensemble. As a trivial example, remember the\nhalf-alive half-dead Schr\u00f6dinger's cat solution in quantum mechanics.\nAlthough Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 look similar, they do not provide the same quantity: The first case is the actual integrated luminosity of a given cluster and the second case\nis the mean integrated luminosity of all the possible clusters with n stars and in the same evolutionary conditions.\nNote also that the problem in population synthesis is not\nthe classical statistical one of estimating n < l >, but the\ninverse one: obtaining the possible theoretical n < l >\nvalues compatible with the observed integrated luminosity Ltot . So, it is necessary to use the complete distribution of theoretical integrated luminosities rather than its\nmean value Ltheo\ntot (n). This distribution provides a metric\nfor goodness-of-fit to stellar population studies.\nAs an illustration of the effects of this intrinsic dispersion, we show in Fig. 3 the 90% confidence interval of\nthe integrated luminosity of a stellar cluster with 105 M\u2299\ntransformed into stars for a given stellar birth rate, metallicity and age. It represents the integrated spectrum of all\n\nWe refer to Cervi\u00f1o & Luridiana (2006) for a more extensive analysis of the probabilistic formulation of population synthesis and Cervi\u00f1o & Luridiana (2007b) for a\nmore complete description about the metrics for goodness of fit.\n\n3.\n\nSYSTEMATIC ERRORS IN SYNTHESIS MODELS\n\nOnce the origin of the intrinsic dispersion of population\nsynthesis models has been described, we are going to discuss the sources of systematic errors and how to take\nadvantage of the IVOA Characterization data model to\ndefine the region of application of synthesis models in\nits parameter space. We refer to Cervi\u00f1o & Luridiana\n(2007a) for a more complete review on the systematic errors.\nIn the following, we will only consider the systematic errors related to stellar population synthesis computations\nitself, assuming that the systematic errors of the inputs\nare known. The main source of systematic errors are:\n1. Atmosphere libraries li : systematic errors in atmosphere libraries mainly depend on how realistic our\nassumption about the classification of stars in the\ndifferent stellar types are (see Garc\u0131\u0301a-Vargas' et al.\n\n\f4\ncontribution in these proceedings). Such an evaluation must be implemented by synthesis models makers.\nIn addition to the systematic errors, the range of application of synthesis models depends in the coverage on the parameter space (log g, Teff , metallicity,\n...), that is the characterization of the library in this\nparameter space.\n2. Tracks/Isochrones and their combination with the\nstar formation history ni : In the case of synthesis models, the shape of isochrones and the density of stars along the isochrone must fit observational data. Small variations in these densities can\nproduce big differences in the models. Hence, it is\ncrucial to know the uncertainties in the evolutionary\ntracks/isochrones used to evaluate the systematic error in synthesis models. Currently, there are different groups working on the evaluation of systematic\nerrors in evolutionary tracks, like Degl'Innocenti et\nal. and Bressan et al.\nAdditionally, since synthesis models describe the\nwhole population, they also need to take into account evolutionary phases that are included in standard evolutionary tracks, like pre-main sequence\nevolution, final evolutionary stages like SN or cooling white dwarfs, etc. In general, synthesis models\nmakers combine tracks of different groups to obtain\na good coverage in evolutionary phases, but in doing\nso, they include a potential source of error due to different physics used in track computations. The evaluation of the associated systematic errors and the\ncoverage of the models results due to these effects\nmust be implemented by synthesis models makers.\n3. Synthesis models algorithms: the final issue is the\nalgorithms used in the model. The main problem\nis how to combine the different coverage and sampling (support and precision respectively, following\nthe Characterization data model) of the atmosphere\nlibraries and isochrones in the log g \u2212 log Teff plane\n(see Fig. 2). In some cases, it is necessary to extrapolate the behavior of atmosphere libraries to regions\nnot covered by the libraries. In addition, there are\nalso differences in how the correspondence of the\npoints in the isochrones and in the atmosphere libraries is done, ranging from how the libraries are\ninterpolated to how the closest model to the given\nisochrone point is chosen.\n\n4.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nSynthesis models, as any other theoretical model, are affected by systematic errors. Although the evaluation of\nsuch errors is a difficult task that only can be performed\nby synthesis models makers, the current IVOA description of spectrum data model allows to add these errors to\nthe output.\nIn the case of statistical errors, the spectral data model\ndoes not apply directly to theoretical results since the goal\nof statistics is inferring the underlying distribution from\nwhich the data have been drawn, which is assumed to be\nknown in the computation of theoretical models. However, the StatError box in the current spectral data model\ncan be used to describe the intrinsic dispersion of theoretical models. The dispersion of synthesis models, although not recognized as such, is computed by several\ncodes under the label of surface brightness fluctuations,\nso this piece of information is already available.\nFinally, a proper characterization of isochrones and atmosphere libraries coverage allows to obtain a realistic\ncharacterization of synthesis models, and its range of application.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research has made use of the Spanish Virtual Observatory supported by the Spanish MCyT through grants\nAyA2005-04286 and AyA2005-24102-E.
