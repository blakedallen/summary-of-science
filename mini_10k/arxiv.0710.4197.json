Szab\u00f3\n\n1. Introduction\nQuantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory describing the strong interactions. According to QCD, as the temperature increases, hadronic matter undergoes a transition to quark gluon\nplasma. The function, which describes the equilibrium in this system for different temperatures, is\nthe equation of state. For the equation of state, practically one has to measure only the pressure,\nwhich then will unambiguously determine the energy density as well. A difficulty emerging about\nthe equation of state is, that perturbation theory does not seem to fit lattice results even at higher\ntemperatures (smaller couplings). While available lattice results both for pure gauge theory [1, 2]\nand for full QCD [3, 4, 5] (and see also [6]) end at around 5 * TC , standard perturbation theory\nconverges only at extremely high temperatures. To create a link between these two methods, we\npresent lattice results on the pressure at temperatures, which were previously unreachable. It becomes possible to compare our data with perturbation theory formulae. Our results are obtained\nusing two different approaches: we present a new way to renormalize the pressure (for this we have\nresults for Nt = 4), and a direct method to measure the pressure (results for Nt = 4, 6 and 8).\n\n2. Renormalization of the pressure\nFor illustration, we present here the technique and the results for pure SU(3) gauge theory.\nThe extension to full QCD is straightforward.\nIn order to obtain results which can be extrapolated to the continuum, one has to renormalize\nthe pressure. This is usually done using the standard integral method [7]:\npren (T ) = p(T ) \u2212 p(0) =\n\nZ\n\nd \u03b2 (hPliT \u2212 hPli0 )\n\n(2.1)\n\nThis way one has to carry out simulations on finite and zero temperature lattices. However, exactly\nzero temperature cannot be realized. Together with the fact, that divergences that are removed by\nrenormalization are independent of the temperature, rises the question: why not use finite T lattices\nfor renormalization? In order to do so, let us introduce the following quantity:\np\u0304(T ) = p(T ) \u2212 p(T /2) =\n\nZ\n\nd \u03b2 (hPliNt \u2212 hPli2*Nt )\n\n(2.2)\n\nHere, instead of using 1/2 for the subtraction temperature, one can use any factor, which is smaller\nthan 1. Now, we may build up pren as a sum of differences, so it can be expressed with p\u0304 as:\npren (T ) = p(T ) \u2212 p(T /2) + p(T /2) \u2212 p(T /4) + . . . = p\u0304(T ) + p\u0304(T /2) + . . .\n\n(2.3)\n\nIn fact, we usually measure the dimensionless pressure, which can be obtained by including the T 4\nfactors:\np\u0304\npren\n= 4\n4\nT\nT\n\n+\nT\n\n1 p\u0304\n*\n16 T 4\n\n+\nT /2\n\n1\n* ...\n256\n\n(2.4)\n\nDue to the increasing powers of 1/16 in the forthcoming terms, one practically needs only a few of\nthem. Applying this scheme, we may reach arbitrary high temperatures using lattices with only Nt\n2\n\n\fThe equation of state at high temperatures from lattice QCD\n\nK.K. Szab\u00f3\n\nand 2 * Nt temporal extent. It is worth mentioning, that a similar formula can be constructed for the\ncase of the normalized interaction measure I \u2261 (\u03b5 \u2212 3 * p)/T 4 :\n \u0304 /2) + . . .\n \u0304 ) + 1 I(T\nIren (T ) = I(T\n16\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere\n \u0304 ) = Nt4 * d \u03b2 /d log a * (hPliNt \u2212 hPli2*Nt )\nI(T\nThe above method can also be easily generalized for the case of dynamical fermions.\nWe can demonstrate the applicability of this technique by using only the finite temperature\nNt = 6 and Nt = 8 data of [1] to reproduce their results obtained by the standard method (which\nuses the more expensive T = 0 data). Here we will use the ratio x = 6/8 instead of the previously\nshown 1/2. We keep only four terms in the sum (2.3), since the forthcoming terms are practically\nnegligible:\np\u2032\n\nz }| {\n= p\u0304(T ) + x4 * p\u0304(xT ) + x8 * p\u0304(x2 T ) +x12 * p\u0304(x3 T )\n\npren\n(2.6)\nT4\nOn figure 1. we show the results obtained by the standard renormalization procedure, and also\nthose by our method.\n\nFigure 1: The dimensionless pressure as a function of the temperature. By summing up the intermediate\nterms (indicated by solid blue lines, denoted by p\u2032 ) we arrive at the total renormalized pressure (solid red\nline), which agrees completely with results obtained by the usual integral method.\n\n3. Setting the scale\nOur new method is not only capable of reconstructing results of the standard procedure, but\nit also has a clear advantage over that, since T = 0 lattices are not needed for the subtraction,\nonly for scale determination. So we need large statistics only for T > 0 simulations, which are\nless demanding in terms of computer resources (memory, CPU time). If we wanted to reach very\nhigh temperatures, we still needed large, and therefore expensive zero temperature lattices to set the\nscale. Alternatively, in the asymptotic scaling region, one might determine the scale using improved\n3\n\n\fThe equation of state at high temperatures from lattice QCD\n\nK.K. Szab\u00f3\n\nperturbation theory. To verify that we are indeed in the asymptotic scaling region, we compare\nresults of the Sommer parameter from [8], and a 3-loop improved perturbation theory formula [9]\ninserted into the expression of the lattice spacing a = \u039b\u22121 (a \u2192 0) fimpPT (\u03b2 ). This comparison on\nfigure 2 shows that the last few lattice simulation points are in the asymptotic scaling regime, which\nmeans that an extrapolation with the perturbative formula might be trusted.\n\nFigure 2: Asymptotic scaling seems to be realized, as the improved perturbation theory formula fits the\nlattice results of the Sommer parameter for larger values of \u03b2 .\n\n4. Results I.\nFor our simulations we used tree level improved Symanzik action, and an overrelaxationheatbath algorithm. The simulations were carried out on lattices with temporal extent Nt = 4; we\nperformed the subtraction on Nt = 8 lattices. In order to account for decreasing screening masses,\nwe used a rather large aspect ratio of Ns /Nt = 8. On figure 3. we show our results on the pressure.\n\nFigure 3: We show the two, non-negligible terms (denoted by dotted lines) of the normalized pressure, and\ntheir sum (solid line). PSB denotes the pressure of the non-interacting gluon gas.\n\nIt is worth mentioning here, that independently of the renormalization procedure, a problem\nemerges within the integral method framework. Since strictly speaking, the pressure is only exactly\n4\n\n\fThe equation of state at high temperatures from lattice QCD\n\nK.K. Szab\u00f3\n\nzero at T = 0, in principle we would have to carry out the integration starting from zero temperature.\nDue to the uncertainty of setting the lower point of the integral, and also due to larger statistical\nfluctuations in the low temperature regime, we needed about 6 times more statistics for the region\nbelow TC , as we did for T = (1 . . . 100) * TC .\n\n5. Direct approach\nIn the following, we will present a method, which is suitable for measuring the pressure directly, instead of integrating the difference of two, separately measured plaquette variables. This\nway we can get rid of the above mentioned lower point-related uncertainty in the integral: we can\nprovide a reference point in the pressure.\nLet us consider one single term of (2.3), namely p\u0304 as defined by eq. (2.2):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nZ(Nt )2\n1\n1\np\u0304 =\nlog Z(Nt ) \u2212\nlog Z(2Nt ) =\nlog\nNt Ns3\n2Nt Ns3\n2Nt Ns3\nZ(2Nt )\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere we expressed the pressure as log Z. Now schematically we can draw the ratio of the two partition functions like the following (let S2b be the action for the boundary condition in the numerator,\nand S1b for the one in the denominator):\n\nR\n\nNow let us take an interpolating partition function Z\u0304(\u03b1 ) = DU exp(\u2212(\u03b1 * S2b + (1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) * S1b )),\nwhich could be depicted like:\n\nUsing Z\u0304(\u03b1 ), one obtains\n\u0012\n\nZ(Nt )2\np\u0304 \u223c log\nZ(2Nt )\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nZ\u0304(1)\n= log\nZ\u0304(0)\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\nZ 1\n0\n\nd\u03b1\n\nd log Z\u0304(\u03b1 )\n=\nd\u03b1\n\nZ 1\n0\n\nd \u03b1 hS1b \u2212 S2b i\n\n(5.2)\n\nSo we can calculate the pressure itself at any given temperature, without carrying out simulations\nat lower temperatures, and then performing an integral. However, the cancellation of the plaquette\nvariables, which makes the former method a difficult task, also emerges in this new method. On\nfigure 4., we plot the integrand of (5.2) as a function of \u03b1 to show why it is hard to calculate the\nintegral with a given precision.\nStill, it is worth using this new method, since our integrand here is proportional to Ns3 , so it is\nexpected to scale with Nt\u22123 instead of Nt\u22124 . This means that we gain a factor of Nt with respect to\nthe standard method. In fact, we have to perform the integral in \u03b1 for each \u03b2 we need. However,\nthere is no need to worry about the lower part of the temperature interval anymore, since using this\nmethod we are able to set the integration constant in the pressure.\n5\n\n\fThe equation of state at high temperatures from lattice QCD\n\nK.K. Szab\u00f3\n\nFigure 4: Cancellation effect in calculating the pressure by our new method. These results were obtained\non Nt = 4 lattices at \u03b2 = 50 (which roughly corresponds to the Planck temperature).\n\n6. Results II.\nThe method discussed above gives us the possibility to measure the pressure at very high\ntemperatures. This was carried out using lattices with temporal extension Nt = 4, Nt = 6 and\nNt = 8. The temperature interval ranged from 4 * TC upto 3 * 107 * TC . Our results are shown on\nfigure 5. A comparison can be done with the standard method, namely the result of [1] for smaller\ntemperatures. Here we present the results which are closest to the continuum limit, thus Nt =\n8. These results nicely follow the perturtbative predictions (see [10, 11, 12], and also [13, 14]).\nHowever, more statistics is needed to determine the whole applicability region of the perturbative\napproach. It is important to point out, that at the highest temperature point, the pressure (within its\nstatistical uncertainty) is already consistent with the Stefan-Boltzmann limit.\n\n7. Conclusion\nWe presented two new methods to determine the equation of state for QCD. Compared to\nprevious techniques, these methods allow to extend the temperature range by orders of magnitude.\nWe developed a renormalization procedure of the pressure, for which no T = 0 simulations are\nneeded, and thus is less expensive than the methods, which were used previously. We also presented\na new approach, which enables us to measure the pressure directly. Using this approach we gain\na factor of Nt in CPU time with respect to the standard method. Our approach can also be used to\nset the integration constant, which provides a reference point for the pressure. Based on these new\nmethods we presented first results on the pressure of the pure gauge theory at temperatures that\ncould not have been reached before.\nAcknowledgements This research was supported by the EU under grant I3HP and DFG under\ngrant FO 502/1.
