Recently there was a significant activity [2, 3] in studing color superconductivity caused mainly by the observation that the superconducting gap can be\nas high as 100 MeV. It is believed that in nature and laboratory experiments color\nsuperconductivity can occur in high energy ion collisions and in the cores of neutron\nstars. Since temperatures obtained in high energy ion collisions are usually significantly more than temperatures characteristic for the color superconductor/quark\ngluon plasma phase transition at the relevant baryon densities, it is unlikely that\ncolor superconductivity can be observed in high energy ion collisions [4]. Thus,\nit is possible that perhaps the only chance of observing color superconductivity is\nconnected with astrophysical observations of neutron stars. Therefore, the study of\nastrophysical implications of the occurence of color superconductivity in the cores\nof neutron stars is an actual and important problem.\nAs well known neutron stars typically possess very strong magnetic fields up to\n1013 G. For usual superconductors, strong enough external magnetic fields destroy\nsuperconductivity. Consequently, it is important to study how the presence of external magnetic field affects the physics of neutron stars with color superconducting\ncores. This problem was considered in a recent paper by Alford, Berges, and Rajagopal [5] (for earlier studies and other astrophysical aspects of the occurence of\ncolor superconductivity in the cores of neutron stars see [6]). Since there is a 'modified' photon, which remains massless in color superconducting phase (it is in the\ngeneral case a mixture of electromagnetic and some gluon fields), Alford, Berges,\nand Rajagopal showed that external magnetic field partially penetrates inside color\nsuperconducting cores and it is very unlike that magnetic fields typical for neutron\n\n2\n\n\fstars can destroy color superconductivity in the cores of neutron stars.\nIn this paper we continue the study of color superconductivity in external magnetic field. In Sect.2 we discuss the reason why the mixing angles in CFL and 2SC\nphases are different despite the fact that the CFL gap goes to the 2SC gap for\nms \u2192 \u221e. We show in Sect.3 that although flavor symmetry is explicitly broken in\nexternal magnetic field all values of gaps in their coset spaces of possible solutions in\nthe CFL phase are equivalent in external magnetic field. Our conclusions are given\nin Sect.4.\n\n2\n\nWhy are mixing angles in the 2SC and CFL\nphases different?\n\nIn paper [5] the CFL phase with three massless quarks and the 2SC phase with two\nmassless quarks were explicitly considered. On the other hand it is known that in\nthe real QCD the mass of the strange quark cannot be neglected [3]. According to\n[3], it is expected that for realistic values of ms a CFL phase with 5 independent\norder parameters is realized. Therefore, it is natural to consider explicitly physical\nproperties of the CFL phase with ms 6= 0 in external magnetic field. (In what follows\nwe consider only the case of the so called 'sharp boundary' transition between nuclear\nand superconducting quark matter. The case of 'smooth boundary' transition is\ntrivial because there is not even partial exclusion of magnetic field flux inside the\nsuperconducting region [5].)\nAccording to [3], the same linear combination of the electromagnetic and gluon\nfields, which is massless in the CFL phase with ms = 0, is also massless in the\n\n3\n\n\fCFL phase with ms 6= 0. Therefore, the mixing angle of the usual photon with\ngluon fields in the CFL phase with ms 6= 0 coincides with the mixing angle in the\nCFL phase with three massless quarks and, consequently, the same part of magnetic\nfield flux penetrates inside a color superconductor in the CFL phase with ms 6= 0.\nHowever, one question remains to be answered. As shown in [3], for ms \u2192 \u221e, the\ngap in the CFL phase with ms 6= 0 goes to the 2SC gap. Obviously, extremely heavy\nstrange quark decouples from the low energy dynamics in this case (of course, in\nthe opposite limit ms \u2192 0, the gap in the CFL phase with ms 6= 0 goes to the gap\nof the CFL phase with three massless quarks). Therefore, one would naively expect\nthat mixing angle is the same in all three phases. However, according to [5], the\nmixing angle in the 2SC phase is two times less than in the CFL phase. Why are\nmixing angles in these phases different?\nTo answer this question we first consider in more detail the definition of mixing\nangle. The color superconducting gap is a vacuum expectation value of two quark\nfields < \u03c8\u03b1i \u03b35 C\u03c8\u03b2i >, therefore, it transforms under flavor and color transformations\nas a tensor product of two natural representations of flavor and color groups of\nsymmetry. If we group indices i and \u03b1 as well as j and \u03b2, then the gap \u2206ij\n\u03b1\u03b2 is a\nmatrix with respect to two united indices i,\u03b1 and j,\u03b2. The action of the covariant\nderivative on the gap is\na\nD\u03bc \u2206 = (\u2202\u03bc + ieA\u03bc Qt.r. + igAa\u03bc Tt.r.\n)\u2206,\n\n(1)\n\nii1\nii1 i1 j\nT i1 j\nwhere t.r. means tensor representation, (Qt.r. \u2206)ij\n\u03b1\u03b2 = Q \u2206\u03b1\u03b2 + \u2206\u03b1\u03b2 (Q ) ,\nij\na\na\nij\na T\nT\n(Tt.r.\n\u2206)ij\nmeans a transpose to a matrix A),\n\u03b1\u03b2 = T\u03b1\u03b11 \u2206\u03b11 \u03b2 + \u2206\u03b1\u03b11 (T )\u03b11 \u03b2 (A\n\nQ=diag(2/3, -1/3, -1/3) the generator of electromagnetic transformations, T a =\n\n\u03bba\n2\n\nthe generators of color transformations, and \u03bba the Gell-Mann matrices. In the general case to find an operator, which is equal to zero acting on the gap, we consider\nan operator of the general form Q\u0303 = Q + a1 T 1 + ... + a8 T 8 and seek a solution\nof the equation Q\u0303\u2206 = 0 that gives us the sought operator Q\u0303.

(It is an easy task to\ncheck that a3 = \u22121 and a8 = \u2212 \u221a13 (others ai = 0) is the sought solution in the\ncase of the CFL phase, i.e., the operator Q\u0303 = Q \u2212 (T 3 +\n\nT8\n\u221a\n)\n3\n\nis equal to zero acting\n\non the CFL gap.) A generalized mixing angle is defined as arccos of the element\nO11 of the matrix O, i.e., it is \u03b1 = arccos n0 . (We say a generalized mixing angle\nbecause a 9\u00d79 orthogonal matrix cannot be parametrized by one independent parameter unlike the familiar case of mixing of two gauge fields in Standard Model.\nHowever, since only the element O11 of the matrix O is important for us, it is convenient to define a generalized mixing angle as arccos of the element O11 ). Since\nOO T = 1 for orthogonal matrices, we have n20 + n21 + ... + n28 = 1 that gives us\neg\n. Therefore, for the CFL phase, we find\ng 2 +(a21 +...+a28 )e2\n\u03b1CF L = arccos \u221a 2 g 2 \u2248 \u221a2e3g \u2248 1/10, where we assumed\ng +4e /3\n\na= \u221a\n\nthat the mixing angle is\nthat as =\n\ng2\n4\u03c0\n\n\u2248 1 at the\n\nscale of baryon densities typical for neutron stars cores and, consequently, the gauge\n5\n\n\ffield A \u0303\u03bc =\n\ngA\u03bc \u2212eA3\u03bc \u2212 \u221ae A8\u03bc\n3\n\nq\n\n2\n\ng 2 + 4e3\n\nfield is massless in the CFL phase. In paper [5] the mixing\n\nangle obtained was twice times more \u03b1ABR = arccos \u221a\n\ng\ng 2 +e2 /3\n\n\u2248\n\n\u221ae\n3g\n\n\u2248 1/20 for the\n\nCFL phase. The discrepancy of our result with that of [5] is because the authors of\n[5] used color generators T a normalized to 2, meanwhile, we used the standard definition of color generators T a =\n\n\u03bba\n2\n\n(of course, our result can be easily recovered if we\n\nreplace g by g/2 in [5]). According, e.g., to Particle Data Group [7], the standard\ndefinition of covariant derivative in QCD, which defines strong coupling constant\nproperly normalized at a fixed scale, is D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + igAa\u03bc T a , where T a = \u03bba /2 and\n\u03bba are the Gell-Mann matrices, therefore, the color generators T a are normalized to\n1\n.\n2\n\nThus, we conclude that the correct value of the mixing angle in the CFL phase\n\nis \u03b1CF L = arccos \u221a\n\ng\ng 2 +4e2 /3\n\n\u2248 1/10. Although our mixing angle is two times more\n\nthan the one found in [5], it does not change qualitative conclusions of [5] because\nthe mixing angle is still a small number and only a small part of the magnetic field\nflux is excluded inside the color superconducting region.\nLet us now return to the question posed above about why the mixing angles\nin the CFL phase and the 2SC phase differ even if the CFL gap goes to the 2SC\nij\ngap for ms \u2192 \u221e. Let us recall that the 2SC gap is \u2206ij\n\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2206\u01eb \u01eb\u03b1\u03b23 , where flavor\n\nindices run over 1 and 2. It is easy to check that the operator Q\u0303 = Q \u2212 (T 3 +\n\nT8\n\u221a\n),\n3\n\nwhich is equal to zero acting on the CFL gap, is also equal to zero acting on the\n2SC gap. Nevertheless, according to [5] the mixing angles in the CFL and 2SC\nphases differ. Why? The answer is that the generator T 3 is equal to zero acting\non the 2SC gap in difference to the case of the CFL phase. Therefore, we can add\nthis generator to our Q\u0303 with any coefficient, i.e., the corresponding equation for Q\u0303\ndoes not have a unique solution. Obviously, the different choice of coefficients of\ncolor generators, which are equal to zero acting on the gap, gives the different value\nof mixing angle. To find what is the correct Q\u0303 in this case, we use the condition\nof minimum of energy. The less the mixing angle, the larger part of the external\n6\n\n\fmagnetic field flux penetrates inside a color superconductor. The minimum of the\nmixing angle \u03b1 = arccos q\n\ng2 +\n\nP8\n\ni=1\n\ng\n\nP8\n\ni=1\n\nobviously corresponds to the minimum of\na2i e2\n\na2i . For the 2SC phase, it is easy to show that the minimum of energy is given\n\nby Q\u0303 = Q \u2212\n\nT8\n\u221a\n.\n3\n\n(Note also that the choice of the diagonal SU(3) generators in the\n\nnatural representation of the group is ambiguous. If we consider the T 3 and T 8 used\n8\n\nT\n), which obviously gives the same\nin [5], then we obtain Q\u0303 = Q \u2212 12 (T 3 + \u221a\n3\n\nP8\n\ni=1\n\na2i ,\n\ni.e., the same mixing angle.) Thus, the mixing angle in the 2SC phase is indeed two\ntimes less \u03b12SC \u2248\n\n3\n\n\u221ae\n3g\n\n\u2248\n\n1\n20\n\nthan in the CFL phase.\n\nExplicit flavor symmetry breaking.\n\nColor and flavor symmetries are spontaneously broken in the CFL phase with ms = 0\nor ms 6= 0. However, since color and flavor transformations are symmetries of\nthe theory, all color and flavor transformed gaps U\u2206 have the same energy and,\ntherefore, SUL (3) \u00d7 SUR (3) \u00d7 SUc (3) \u00d7 UB (1)/SUL+R+c (3) and SUL (2) \u00d7 SUR (2) \u00d7\nSUc (3) \u00d7 UB (1)/SUL+R+c (3) are the corresponding coset spaces of possible solutions\nfor gaps in the CFL phase with 3 massless quarks and in the CFL phase with ms 6= 0,\nrespectively.\nSince the generator of electromagnetic transformations does not commute with\nSU(3) or SU(2) flavor transformations, one can expect that a color superconductor\nin the CFL phase chooses a specific value in its coset space of possible solutions\nin external electromagnetic field. Indeed, if A\u03bc 6= 0, then the Lagrangian has only\nSUc (3) color symmetry. Thus, the flavor symmetry is explicitly broken if A\u03bc 6= 0. We\nshow below that since the CFL gap locks flavor and color, one can, in fact, use color\ntransformations and, therefore, the corresponding flavor transformed gap U\u2206 has\n7\n\n\fthe same energy as the initial gap \u2206 even if A\u03bc 6= 0 (the case of a color transformed\ngap is, of course, trivial because Q commutes with color transformations).\nWe first consider the CFL phase with 3 massless quarks. The corresponding gap\nis [2]\ni j\ni j\n\u2206ij\n\u03b1\u03b2 = k1 \u03b4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b2 + k2 \u03b4\u03b2 \u03b4\u03b1 .\n\n(3)\n\n8\n\nT\n) is equal to zero acting on the gap. Let us consider\nThe operator Q\u0303 = Q \u2212 (T 3 + \u221a\n3\n\na flavor transformed gap U\u2206. Since [Q, U] 6= 0, Q\u0303U\u2206 6= 0 in the general case and\n\nwe should seek another operator Q \u0303U , which is equal to zero acting on the gap U\u2206,\ni.e., we seek a solution of the equation\n1\n8\n(Qt.r. + a1 Tt.r.\n+ ... + a8 Tt.r.\n)Ut.r. \u2206 = 0,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich gives\nQ+\n\n8\nX\n\nai U(T i )T U + = 0\n\n(5)\n\ni=1\n\nor what is more convenient for analysis\nU + QU +\n\n8\nX\n\nai (T i )T = 0,\n\n(6)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere we used the fact that k1 and k2 are independent order parameters. Multipling\nEq.(6) by T j and taking trace, we obtain a system of equations for ai\n8\nX\ni=1\n\nai tr((T i )T T j ) = \u2212tr(U + QUT j ).\n\n(7)\n\nIt is easy to check that for U=1 we obtain the old solution a3 = \u22121, a8 = \u2212 \u221a13 , and\nothers ai = 0. Our analysis is simplified by noting that Q can be represented as\nQ = \u2212 I3 + A, where I is the unity matrix and A is a matrix whose the only nonzero\nelement is A11 = 1. Indeed, since U + U = 1 and trT i = 0, we need to calculate only\ntrU + AUT j on the right-hand side of Eq.(7). By parametrizing U as follows\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec u1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\nU = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec v1\n\uf8ed\n\nu2\nv2\n\n\uf8f6\n\nu3 \uf8f7\n\nw1 w2 w3\n8\n\n\uf8f7\n\n\uf8f7\n,\nv3 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\fwe find ai and then\n\nP8\n\ni=1\n\na2i , which is equal to\n8\nX\n\n4\na2i = (|u1|2 + |v1 |2 + |w1 |2 )2 .\n3\ni=1\n\n(8)\n\nSince U is a unitary matrix, we have UU + = 1 that gives us |u1 |2 + |v1 |2 + |w1 |2 = 1.\nTherefore, we obtain from Eq.(8) that\n\nP8\n\ni=1\n\na2i = 4/3 for any flavor transformed\n\ngap. Obviously that a similar analysis can be used for the CFL phase with ms 6= 0.\nThe case of the 2SC phase is trivial because flavor symmetry is not spontaneously\nbroken in this phase. Thus, although the generator of electromagnetic transformations does not commute with flavor transformations and we have an explicit flavor\nsymmetry breaking, all flavor transformed CFL gaps have the same energy. Of\ncourse, the reason for this is that the CFL gap locks flavor and color and, therefore, the corresponding equation for the operator Q \u0303U , which is equal to zero acting\non U\u2206, coincides with the equation for the operator Q\u0303 (with unitary transformed\ncolor generators U + T i U (see Eq.(5))), which is equal to zero acting on the \u2206, that,\nof course, gives us the same\nunitary transformation.\n\n4\n\nP8\n\ni=1\n\na2i because color generators are defined up to a\n\nConclusions.\n\nWe considered how external magnetic field influences color superconductivity for\nthe CFL phase with 3 massless quarks, the CFL phase with ms 6= 0, and the 2SC\nphase with 2 massless quarks. We explained why the mixing angles in the 2SC and\nCFL phases are different even if the gap of the CFL phase with ms 6= 0 goes to the\n2SC gap for ms \u2192 \u221e. We showed that despite expilicit flavor symmetry breaking\nin external magnetic field, all values of flavor transformed gaps in their coset spaces\n9\n\n\fof possible solutions in the CFL phase are equivalent.\nThe author thanks A.A.
