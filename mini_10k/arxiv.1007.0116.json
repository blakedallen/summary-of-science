Recently, in the context of quantum information processing, such Hamiltonians attracted renewed\nattention because the ensemble can serve as quantum\nmemory with long coherence times [2\u20135]. Despite small\ncoupling of individual atoms, the strong collective coupling of the ensemble to a particular cavity mode allows\nfor the coherent transfer of an excitation to the ensemble, its storage and its retrieval after some time shorter\nthan the coherence time of the system. Hence, due to\ncollective effects, one can utilize atomic transitions and\ngeometries for which the strong coupling regime would\nnot be accessible otherwise.\nAs a particularly striking example, one can even envisage the use of states that are very weakly coupled to the\nfield, for example, an optically forbidden hyperfine transition, which only couple to the field via magnetic dipole\ninteraction. What makes this idea attractive and possibly feasible with current technology is the fact that it\nshould be possible to fabricate high-Q stripline waveguide\ncavities on the superconducting surface of a microchip,\nwhich confine the microwave mode to a very small effective volume and to simultaneously trap a large ensemble\nof cold atoms very close to the surface. The combination\nof high-Q stripline waveguide cavities and atom-trapping\ntechnology surely will involve new challenges, but there\nseem to be no fundamental problems. As already demonstrated, such a cavity can be strongly coupled to on-chip\nCooper-pair box qubits [6]. By combining the two systems, one thus could establish a connection between the\natomic ensemble and solid-state qubits. This setup hence\nbridges an enormous range of time scales starting from\nthe sub-microsecond scale of solid-state qubits, over the\nmillisecond lifetime of microwave photons, to the atomic\nhyperfine coherence lifetime of seconds.\n\nIn the particular setup discussed here, the ensemble\nconsists of a cloud of ultracold 87 Rb trapped in an on-chip\nmagnetic wire trap and pumped to one of the trappable\nhyperfine levels, for example, F = 1, mF = \u22121. The\ninteraction between the atoms and the field is dominated\nby the magnetic dipole transitions between |F = 1, mF i\nand |F = 2, m\u2032F i. These transitions are widely used for\nhyperfine manipulations of cold atomic ensembles by externally injected microwaves [7]. We assume in the following that the experimental setup guarantees that the\ncavity is resonant with only one of the possible transitions\n(e.g. mF = \u22121 and m\u2032F = 1 with transition frequency\n\u03c9a / (2\u03c0) = 6.83 GHz, corresponding to T \u2248 330 mK),\nand hence allows for the atoms to be treated as two-level\nsystems. Actually, in some cases it is more favorable to\nuse Raman-type coupling employing an extra radio-wave\nfield to choose a suitable microwave transition [8].\nWe ignore some of these technical details at this point\nand focus on the three main topics: After the introduction of the model in Sec. II, we first investigate conditions\nfor strong coupling between the ensemble and the cavity\nand the experimental consequences when one adds the\nobscuring effects of thermal photons due to a finite cavity temperature. In Secs. III A and III B we discuss the\nmethods we use, whereas in Secs. III C\u2013 III F we address\nseveral aspects of the resulting dynamics. Here the optically aligned ensemble, which has much lower effective\ntemperature, can be expected to act as a heat sink for\nthe cavity mode removing thermal photons. As the upper and lower hyperfine states have a virtually infinite\nlifetime compared with other system time scales, we can\nalso completely invert the system, mimicking an effective\nnegative temperature, and use it to pump energy into\nthe system. As a prominent example, we study in Sec. IV\nthe superradiant decay of a fully inverted ensemble again\nwith some thermal photons initially present. Finally, we\nexhibit in Sec. V the possibility of building an ultranarrow linewidth single-chip stripline micromaser operating directly on an atomic clock type transition, which\nis in close analogy to an optical-lattice-based setup, as\n\n\f2\nrecently suggested in [9].\nII.\nA.\n\nThe interaction can then be conveniently rewritten in\nP\n\u00b1\nterms of normalized collective operators e\nS = \u221a1N i \u03c3i\u00b1\nto obtain\n\u0010 +\n\u0011\n\u2212\n+ \u2212\ne = ~\u03c9m a\u2020 a + ~\u03c9a e\n, (4)\nS a + a\u2020 e\nS\nS e\nS +~geff e\nH\n\nMODEL\n\nCollective atom-field Hamiltonian\n\nA single atom, formally represented here by a twolevel system resonantly coupled to a cavity mode, can\nbe well described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian.\nFor N two-level systems trapped so close to each other\nin the cavity that they see the same field and thus are\ncoupled to the mode with equal strength g, we then get\nthe generalized Hamiltonian:\nX\n\u0001\n~\u03c9a X z\n\u03c3j+ a + a\u2020 \u03c3j\u2212 .\n\u03c3j + ~g\nH = ~\u03c9m a\u2020 a +\n2 j\nj\n(1)\n\nwith a being the annihilation operator for a cavity photon, \u03c3j+ being the excitation operator for the jth two\u0002\n\u0003\nlevel system and \u03c3i+ , \u03c3j\u2212 = \u03c3iz \u03b4ij . The frequency of the\ntwo-level systems and the mode are denoted by \u03c9a and\n~ (~r) * ~\u03bc/~\n\u03c9m , respectively. The coupling strength g = B\ndepends on the strength of the magnetic field per pho~ at the position ~r of the atoms and the magnetic\nton B\nmoment ~\u03bc of the considered transition.\nWhat make an ensemble of atoms coupled to a cavity\ninteresting are collective effects emerging from the common coupling of all atoms to the same mode. This can\nbe well illustrated\nP by introducingPcollective atomic operators S\u00b1 = j \u03c3j\u00b1 and Sz = 21 j \u03c3jz . The treatment\nin terms of collective operators provides a convenient basis for classifying the possible states of the ensemble and\nis therefore discussed here. As we see in Sec. II B, we\nhave to resort to Hamiltonian (1) in our particular treatment. The introduction of S\u00b1 and Sz leads to the TavisCummings form of this Hamiltonian:\n\u0001\nHTC = ~\u03c9m a\u2020 a + ~\u03c9a Sz +~g S+ a + a\u2020 S\u2212\n(2)\n\nwhere single photons are coupled to distributed (delocalized) excitations in the ensemble [1]. Let us shortly\nreview some of its most known properties here. Mathematically, the collective operators follow the standard\ncommutation relations for angular momentum operators S = (Sx , Sy , Sz ), with S\u00b1 = (Sx \u00b1i Sy ). The corresponding eigenstates of S2 and Sz are the so-called\nDicke states |J, M i, with S2 |J, M i = J(J + 1) |J, M i\nand Sz |J, M i = M |J, M i, where J = 0, 1, . . . , N/2\nand M = \u2212J, . . . , J. Formally, a fully inverted ensemble corresponds to the maximum angular momentum of\nJ = N/2 [10, 11] and projection M = N/2. Repeated application of the collective downward ladder operator S\u2212\non the initial state |J, Ji =\nb |e, e, . . . , ei gives the lowest\nstate |J, \u2212Ji =\nb |g, g, . . . , gi.\nThe states in between are generated according to\np\nS\u00b1 |J, M i = (J \u00b1 M + 1) (J \u2213 M ) |J, M \u00b1 1i . (3)\n\n\u221a\nwith geff = g N . Note that in the case where the atoms\nin the ensemble couple to the cavity with different couP\n\u00b1\n1\npling constants gi , we generalize to e\nS = geff\ngi \u03c3i\u00b1 ,\npP\n\u221a i\n2\nwith geff =\ni gi . This reduces to geff = g N if all gi\nare equal. To simplify matters, we remain with the case\nof equal coupling strength.\nAllowing only one excitation in the system, we see\nthat the ground state |0ia =\nb |J, \u2212Ji =\nb |g, g, . . . , gi\nis only coupled to the symmetric atomic exci+\ntation state e\nS |0ia = |1ia = |J, \u2212J + 1i =\nb\n\u221a1 (|e, g, g, . . . , gi + |g, e, g, . . . , gi + * * * + |g, . . . , g, ei),\nN\nwhile other atomic states with only one excitation play\nno role. Hence, in this form we end up again with\na two-level atomic system, where the dependence of\nthe atom-cavity coupling on the number of atoms is\nexplicitly visible. Even for transitions with a very small\ncoupling constant g, strong coupling can be achieved for\nsufficiently large N .\nz\ne+ e\u2212\nS \u2248 \u2212 21 + S NS , where\nNote that in Eq. (4) we use e\nP z\nz\n1\ne\nS = 2N\ni \u03c3i . This approximation is exactly valid only\neither for a single atom or the special case where we consider only one excitation in the system. The constant \u2212 21\nis neglected in the Hamiltonian. In general, we find for\na state with J = N2 and M = \u2212J + s\n\nand\n\nz\ns\n1\nhJ, \u2212J + s| e\nS |J, \u2212J + si = \u2212 +\n2 2J\n+ \u2212\ns (s \u2212 1)\nhJ, \u2212J + s| e\nS e\nS |J, \u2212J + si = s \u2212\n.\n2J\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nFor s \u226a N we neglect the second term on the right-hand\nz\nside of Eq. (6) and find the approximation for e\nS , which\nbecomes exact for s = 1.\nFor large ensembles with few excitations this approximation is closely related to the bosonization procedure.\nFor M \u2248 \u2212J with J = N/2 and from\nh + \u2212i\n1 \u0002 + \u2212\u0003\ne\nS ,S\nS ,e\nS =\nN\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013\nz\n2S\n1\n(7)\n=\n1,\n= \u22121 + O\nN\nN\nwe find that for few excitations it is possible to iden+\n\u2212\ntify e\nS and e\nS with bosonic creation and annihilation\noperators. Hence, we end up with a system of coupled\noscillators, for which a great deal of solution techniques\nexist.\nLet us now come back to the atom-field interaction\n[Eq. (4)]. It is well known that the eigenstates are coherent superpositions of the two previously introduced basis\n\n\f3\nstates, where the excitation is located either in the mode\nor in the ensemble. Let |0im and |1im = a\u2020 |0im be the\npossible states of the mode and |0ia and |1ia be the ensemble states. With \u03c9a = \u03c9m , the two eigenstates then\nread\n1\n|+i = \u221a (|1ia |0im + |0ia |1im ) ,\n2\n1\n|\u2212i = \u221a (|1ia |0im \u2212 |0ia |1im ) ,\n2\n\n(8)\n\nMaster equation including decoherence and\nthermal noise\n\nIn any realistic implementation of the preceding model,\ncoupling of the thermal environment to the field mode\nand the atoms is unavoidable. This generates several\nsources of noise and decoherence we have to address to\nbe able to reliably describe the dynamics. Despite its\nhigh Q value, the microwave resonator still has a nonnegligible finite linewidth \u03ba = 1/\u03c4 . In other words, a\nstored photon is likely to be lost from the cavity after\nthe time \u03c4 . Similarly, atomic excitations are assumed to\ndecay with a rate that is, fortunately, in our case negligibly small in practice [13]. However, we have to consider\ntrap loss of atoms leaving the cavity mode, which generates an effectively faster decay of the atomic excitation,\ndenoted by the rate \u03b3a . This can be to some extent controlled by a suitable choice of the trapping states and\ntrap geometry. An additional and in general quite serious source of noise are thermal photons that leak into\nthe cavity. For an unperturbed cavity mode they lead to\nan average occupation number of\nn\u0304(\u03c9m , T ) =\n\ne\n\nm\n\u2212 ~\u03c9\nk T\n\n1\u2212e\n\nB\n\nm\n\u2212 ~\u03c9\nk T\n\n,\n\nd\n1\n\u03c1 = [H, \u03c1] + L [\u03c1] ,\ndt\ni~\n\n(9)\n\nand as expected are separated by the energy difference\n2geff . Of course, the system possesses more states containing essentially one excitation quantum, but those are\nnot directly coupled to the ground state if we consider\nonly collective operators. The collective operators couple states within one J manifold, like the previously\ndiscussed manifold with maximum angular momentum\nJ = N/2 and M = \u2212J . . . J. Taking into account the\nmanifolds of states with J < N/2, one can see that in\ngeneral there is a large number of states describing an\nensemble with n excitations. In the forthcoming calculations including spontaneous emissions, such states with\nJ < N/2 can be populated as well [12]. In addition, we\nalso do not restrict the dynamics to a single excitation.\nB.\n\nrelevant time scales. In principle, even this rate could be\ncollectively enhanced, but it largely addresses collective\nstates only very weakly coupled to the cavity mode.\nPutting all these noise sources together, we can use\nstandard quantum optical methods to derive a corresponding master equation for the reduced atom-cavity\ndensity matrix [14]:\n\n(10)\n\nB\n\nwhere T denotes the temperature of the environment. In\nprinciple, such thermal photons are also present on the\natomic transition and lead to a thermalization of the optically pumped atomic ensemble. Fortunately, the weak\ndipole moment of the atom renders this thermalization\nrate so slow that it can be ignored at the experimentally\n\n(11)\n\nwith the Liouvillian\nL [\u03c1] =Lcavity [\u03c1] + Lspont [\u03c1]\n\n=\u03ba (n\u0304 + 1) 2a\u03c1a\u2020 \u2212 a\u2020 a\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1a\u2020 a\n\u0001\n+ \u03ban\u0304 2a\u2020 \u03c1a \u2212 aa\u2020 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1aa\u2020\n\u2212\n\n\u0001\n\nN\n\u0001\n\u03b3a X + \u2212\n\u03c3j \u03c3j \u03c1 + \u03c1\u03c3j+ \u03c3j\u2212 \u2212 2\u03c3j\u2212 \u03c1\u03c3j+ . (12)\n2 j=1\n\nWe assumed here that direct thermal excitations of the\natoms can be neglected due to the weak coupling of the\nhyperfine transition to the environment. The only significant influx of thermal energy thus occurs via the cavity\ninput-output couplers (mirrors). Note that the part of\nthe Liouvillian describing spontaneous emission reflects\nthe assumption that the atoms are coupled to N statistically independent reservoirs. The main reason for this\ntreatment is that the decay rate \u03b3a summarizes the very\nsmall decay rate of atomic excitations and the loss rate of\natoms from the trap. Since the loss of individual atoms\nfrom the trap is a noncollective process, the independent\nreservoirs assumption is advisable. This part of the Liouvillian cannot be written in terms of collective operators,\nand therefore it will not conserve J [15]. Therefore, states\nwith J < N/2, including dark states, become accessible.\nIII.\n\nSIGNATURES OF STRONG COUPLING\n\nA decisive first step toward applications of such system is the precise characterization and determination of\ntheir limits. In particular, the experimental confirmation of sufficiently strong atom-field coupling compared\nto the inherent decoherence processes is of vital importance. This has to be seen in connection with extra limitations induced by thermal photons in the mode, which\nin contrast to optical setups play an important role in\nthe microwave domain. We thus need reliable methods\nto determine the atom number, their effective coupling\nstrength, and noise properties. In particular, we want to\nfind the minimum temperature requirements that would\nmake it possible to observe strong coupling.\nA.\n\nNumerical solution for small particle number\n\nTo get some first qualitative understanding of finite T\neffects, we study the coupled atom-field dynamics in the\n\n\f4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nD\n\na\u2020 a\n\nE\n\nss\n\nD\n\na\u2020 a\n\nE\n\nss\n\nregime of strong coupling under the influence of thermal\nphotons based on the direct numerical solution of the\nmaster equation. Of course, here we have to resort to\n(a)\n0\nthe limit of only a few atoms with increased coupling per\nparticle. Nevertheless, at least the qualitative influence\n0.03\nof thermal photons will become visible. For the practical\nimplementation, we rely on the quantum optics toolbox\nfor Matlab to explicitly calculate the dynamics of the\ndensity matrix [16], which allows straightforward imple0.01\nmentation of the Hamiltonian in Eq.

This effect is expected to\nbe less important if the ensemble contains a large number\nof atoms. However, this regime is not accessible for direct\nthen obeys\nnumerical simulations and we have to develop alternative\nd\nd z\nsemianalytic approaches.\nh\u03c3i i = Tr{\u03c3iz \u03c1}\ndt\ndt\n\u0001\n= \u2212i2g \u03c3i+ a \u2212 \u03c3i\u2212 a\u2020 \u2212 \u03b3a (h\u03c3iz i + 1) (13)\nB.\n\nTruncated cumulant expansion of collective\nobservables\n\nTo overcome the system size restrictions of a direct numerical solution, we now turn to an alternative approach\nthat does not rely on the simulation of the dynamics of\nthe whole density matrix.

The remaining parameters were chosen as in Fig. 1.\n\nand tested in general. Here we stop at third order, which\nin similar situations has proven to be well suited to describe the essential correlations [9].\nThe expansion for an expectation value of the form\nhabi is the well-known relation habi = habic + hai hbi,\nwith habic being the covariance between a and b.

The\nresults show that for a sufficiently large number of atoms strong coupling remains observable despite of the presence of thermal\nphotons.\n\nincoherent pump of the atoms. In essence, this gives\nan additional term in the Liouvillian very much resembling spontaneous emission in opposite direction.

In this case we transform into a rotating\nframe with respect to the frequency of the pump \u03c9l . This\nresults in \u2206m = \u03c9m \u2212 \u03c9l for the detuning of the cavity\nand \u2206a = \u03c9a \u2212 \u03c9l for the detuning of the atoms with\nrespect to the pump frequency.\nIn general, the set of equations is too complex for a direct analytical solution and has to be integrated numeri-\n\ncally. In this way we obtain the steady-state expectation\nvalues of relevant observables as the occupation number\nof the cavity a\u2020 a or the inversion of the ensemble h\u03c31z i.\nTo compare the results of the obtained equations with\nthe results in Sec. III A, we plot the steady-state number of photons and the field in the cavity for different\nfrequencies of the pump laser in Fig. 3. We clearly see\nthat effective strong coupling appears for a sufficiently\nlarge number of weakly coupled atoms and can stay visible also at higher temperatures. Further discussion is\ngiven in Sec. III E. In Fig. 4 we schematically depict the\nsetup including the described loss and pump processes.\n\nC.\n\nCavity output spectrum at finite temperature\n\nNaturally, the total field intensity in the cavity is only\npart of the story and significant physical information can\nbe obtained from a spectral analysis of the transmitted\nfield. Using the quantum regression theorem, the spec-\n\n\f7\ntrum of the light transmitted through one of the mirrors\ncan be expressed in terms of the Fourier transform of the\ncorresponding autocorrelation function of the field amplitude.\n\nto the spectrum that arise from the reservoir, the cavity and cavity-reservoir interference. The initial conditions necessary for the Laplace transform are the steadystate values obtained either numerically for the coherently pumped cavity or analytically (see Sec. V).\nWe show the spectrum of the cavity without any pump,\ncoherent or incoherent, but with T = 0.1 K in Fig. 5. The\nspectrum shows absorption dips at the frequencies of the\ncoupled ensemble-cavity system. Some thermal photons\nthat leak into the cavity are absorbed and lost into modes\nother than the cavity mode. In this form the thermal field\nis a broadband probe of resonant system absorption.\nD.\n\nFIG. 4. To simplify matters, we depict the cavity as a FabryPerot cavity which can be pumped through a mirror with\nhigh reflectivity. The observation of the dynamics is carried\nout using the second mirror, which has a lower reflectivity.\nAdditionally, we can pump the ensemble incoherently from\nthe side.\n\nAt finite T this is not the full story, and to obtain\nthe actual spectrum of the light impinging on the detector, one has to include the thermal photons in the\noutput mode reflected from the cavity. Hence, the normalized first-order correlation function of the field outside the cavity will have additional contributions from\nthe correlation function of the thermal field, as well as\nof the correlation between the thermal field and the cavity field [18]. The latter is causing interference effects\nbetween cavity field and the thermal field. The correlations between reservoir operators and cavity operators\ncan be expressed in terms of averages involving cavity\noperators alone [15, 18].

(19) can be obtained via the quantum regression theorem. The resulting system of coupled equations is Laplace transformed to give the contributions\n\nCooling the field mode with the atomic\nensemble\n\nThe spectra depicted in Fig. 5 show a weak loss of\nthermal photons from the coupled ensemble-cavity system. Cavity photons are absorbed and sometimes scattered into a mode other than the cavity mode. As the\nensemble can be nearly perfectly optically pumped into\na particular state, its effective temperature is close to\nzero and hence well below the mode temperature. A\nrelative purity of the ensemble of 10\u22125 corresponds\n\u0001 to\nT \u223c 28 mK, where we used ~\u03c9a /kb T = ln 10\u22125 with\n\u03c9a /2\u03c0 = 6.83 GHz. This leads to the question as to\nwhat extent the thermal occupation of the mode can be\nreduced by thermal contact between the two systems via\nsuch energy transfer and loss. In Fig. 6(a) we show the\ndynamics of the photon number in the mode at different\ntemperatures after putting the systems into contact. In\nFig. 6(b) we consider different loss or decay rates \u03b3a of the\nexcited atoms. In practice one could think of coupling to\nan magnetically untrapped atomic state or adding some\nrepumping mechanism to increase this intrinsically very\nlow rate. The dynamics is found numerically by integrating Eqs. (15)\u2013(18). To see the effect for increasing\ntemperature in Fig. 6(a), we initialize the ensemble with\nall atoms in the ground state, whereas the mode contains n\u0304 (\u03c9m , T ) photons. The decay rate of the atoms\nis chosen to be \u03b3a = 5 * 104 . With increasing temperature the initial number of photons also increases. Due\nto coherent transfer and decay via the atoms, a constant\nfraction of the photons is removed from the cavity mode.\nIn Fig. 6 (b) we show the same effect except that we now\nkeep the temperature fixed to T = 4 K and vary the decay of the atoms \u03b3a = 1 * 103 . . . 2 * 105 . The steady state\nof the photon number strongly depends on \u03b3a .

The inversion\nh\u03c31z iss can be calculated analytically from Eqs. (15)\u2013(18).\nThe loss of thermal photons is proportional to the loss\nrate \u03b3a and the number of atoms in the excited state\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 5. (Color online) Overview of the transmitted spectrum S for different sizes of the ensemble (a). The temperature of\nthe cavity is set to T = 0.1 K (n\u0304 = 0.04). The remaining parameters were chosen to be \u03ba = 7 * 103 , \u03b3a = 0.3, g = 40,\n\u03c9a = \u03c9m = 2\u03c0 * 6.83 GHz. The dips in the spectrum indicate that thermal photons are absorbed by the ensemble and reemitted into modes other than the cavity mode. The increasing distance between the absorption dips reflects the increasing\nnumber of atoms. In panels (b)-(d) we depict the spectra at N1 = 3.2 * 106 , N2 = 1 * 106 , and N3 = 3.4 * 105 , indicated in (a) by\nthe dashed horizontal lines.\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1+h\u03c31z iss\n. The latter becomes very small if \u03b3a beN\n2\ncomes large. Hence there is an optimal loss rate for each\nset of parameters.\nThe removal of thermal photons becomes more effective if the number of atoms is increased. Meanwhile,\nthe inversion of the ensemble also drops since the fraction of excited atoms is decreased. Overall, the effect is\nclearly visible (see Fig. 7), but it seems that for the actual parameters here its practical value remains limited.\nHowever, with a larger atom number and more tailored\ndecay rates the method could be employed to reset a particular mode shortly before starting any quantum gate\noperation. Note that this treatment of the cooling process is limited to short time scales since the permanent\nloss of excitations via \u03b3a involves the loss of atoms from\nthe ensemble. The number of lost atoms after the time\nt, approximated by the number of thermal photons that\nentered the cavity t\u03ban\u0304, has to be much smaller than the\nensemble size N , which restricts the time t.\nIn the situation where the mode is at T \u2248 0 K and\nthe atoms are subject to incoherent pumping we find increased transmission for the resonance\nfrequencies (see\n\u221a\nFig. 8).

This quantity is much less obscured by random thermal field fluctuations than the spectral intensity in total. As a phase reference, we therefore now introduce a coherent phase stable pump of the cavity, which is again represented in the\n\u0001\nHamiltonian by the additional term Hp = i~ \u03b7a\u2020 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2217 a .\nAs mentioned previously, a coherent pump strongly increases the number of nonvanishing cumulants and at our\nlevel of truncation leads to a set of 13 coupled equations,\nwhich can be found in Appendix A. Based on this set,\nwe can calculate the stationary real- and imaginary part\nof the field in the cavity after transient dynamics. The\namplitude of the field inside the cavity becomes maximal\nif the frequency \u03c9l of the driving laser hits one of the\nresonances of the coupled system. As we give a phase\nreference now the effect of a higher temperature on the\nfield in the cavity is barely visible, in particular if we\nchose a large ensemble of N = 105 atoms (see Fig. 9).\nNote that although not giving the vacuum Rabi splitting, the average atom-field coupling can be still deduced\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1 \u00d7 105\n\n0.5\n\n1 \u00d7 105\n\n\u2206m (rad/s)\n\n(b)\n\n0.005\nIm(haiss )\n\n(b)\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\u22120.005\n\u22120.01\n\u22121\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\u2206m (rad/s)\n\nFIG. 10.

For the small\nensemble with N = 102 atoms we recover the effects of the\nthermal photons. To compensate for the lower number of\natoms, the coupling is chosen to g = 1200. Otherwise, the\nsplitting would be covered by the cavity linewidth.\n\nfrom these resonances as g enters in their frequency. If\nwe go back to a rather small ensemble of N = 102 atoms,\nthe influence of the temperature becomes visible. To ensure that we still can observe well split levels, which are\nnot covered by the linewidth of the cavity, we increase\nthe coupling constant g in our simulation. The results\nin Fig. 10 show that thermal effects become visible in\nthe field only if the number of thermal photons is not\nnegligible compared to N .\nF.\n\nSpectrum of the coherently driven cavity\n\nThe spectral intensity distribution of the coherently\npumped cavity is calculated in a way similar to that described in Sec. III C. In contrast to the incoherent pump\nprocess that excites atoms in a noncollective way, as can\nbe seen from the Liouvillian, the interaction with the\ncoherently pumped mode is a collective interaction. To\ndemonstrate this behavior, we calculate the spectral distribution of the mode intensity, without caring about the\nreservoir it radiates into, and the spectrum of the fluo-\n\n\f12\n2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\nScavity (s)\n\nScavity (s)\n\n(a)\n\n3\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n\n2\n\n(c)\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\u22121.5 \u22121 \u22120.5 0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c9(rad/s)\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n0\n\u22122\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\u03c9(rad/s)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n2 \u00d7 105\n\nSatoms (s)\n\n2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125\n2.4 (d)\n2.3\n2.2\n2.1\n2\n1.9\n1.8\n1.7\n1.6\n1.5\n\u22121.5 \u22121 \u22120.5 0\n\nSatoms (s)\n\n5 \u00d7 10\u22125\n4.5 (b)\n4\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03c9(rad/s)\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\u03c9(rad/s)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n2 \u00d7 105\n\nFIG. 11.

(Color online) Dynamics of superradiant emission:\nnumerical solutions of the dynamical equations for an ensemble of N = 105 atoms. The rapid drop of the inversion h\u03c31z i\nduring the emission can be seen in (a). The exchange of excitations between the ensemble and the cavity is characterized\nby a\u03c31+ in (b). Negative imaginary part of a\u03c31+ indicates\nemission from the ensemble into the cavity, where a positive\nimaginary part indicates absorption of cavity photons by the\nensemble. In (c) the number of photons in the cavity is depicted. Panel (d) shows the spin-spin correlation \u03c31+ \u03c32\u2212 . In\nthis example the temperature of the mode was chosen to be\nT = 4 K.\n\nis hence possible that the ensemble ends up in a dark\nstate, where it does not couple to the cavity mode. The\ntime-constant that determines the decay into and the decay of such a dark state is of the order 1/\u03b3a . This allows\nfor the buildup of long time coherences, and the times\nthe ensemble is in a dark state significantly change the\nstatistics of the photon emission. The result is then a\nnarrow peak in the incoherent spectrum [19, 20], where\nthe width of the peak is determined by the characteristic\ntime the ensemble resides in a bright or dark state, in\nour case \u03b3a .\nIn the case of an incoherently pumped ensemble, the narrow peak does not arise. A reason for this can be the nature of the incoherent pump which is noncollective and\nhence able to pump the ensemble out of a dark state in\na shorter time. This is not possible in the case of the\ncoherently pumped cavity: Spontaneous emission brings\nthe ensemble to a dark state, but the collective interaction with the mode cannot reach it there.\n\nIV.\n\nSUPERRADIANCE\n\nA great advantage of the considered setup is that one\nhas full control of the atomic state. Hence, instead of\nstarting at a zero-temperature ground state we can pre-\n\nFIG. 13. Dynamics of the photon number in the cavity with\nincreasing temperature. The onset of the superradiant emission is shifted to earlier times since the initially present thermal photons contribute to the fluctuations that trigger the\nemission process.\n\npare an almost fully inverted ensemble, which can feed\nenergy into the system and corresponds to an effective\nnegative temperature [21]. Since we have no initial phase\nbias in the system, Eqs. (15)\u2013(18) are suitable for describing the dynamics. The resulting superradiant dynamics for an initially fully inverted ensemble is depicted\nin Fig. 12. In free space the emission occurs in a characteristic burst of duration \u2248 \u03b3a1N [22]. The presence of the\ncavity causes a partial reabsorption of the emitted photons, which can be seen in Fig. 12 (c). Due to the large\nnumber of emitted photons it should be clearly detectable\neven on a fairly high thermal background. Following the\npulse shape, one also can extract the effective coupling\nparameters to characterize the system.\nThe process of superradiance can create a transient\nentangled state of the ensemble [23]. This entanglement\ncan be revealed by entanglement witnesses which can be\ninferred from the calculated observables. We have seen\nsome indication of such entanglement appearing. However, the persistence of the entanglement under the influence of noise and with the presence of the cavity will\nbe part of future work.\nThe onset of superradiant emission is determined by\nspontaneously emitted photons that trigger the forthcoming burst of radiation. The presence of thermal photons is expected to reduce the time until the onset of the\nburst. This behavior is recovered by our equations as\nshown in Fig. 13, where we depict the dynamics of the\nphoton number in the cavity for different temperatures.\n\nV.\n\nNARROWBANDWIDTH HYPERFINE\nMICROMASER\n\nThe collectively coupled ensemble can be used to construct a stripline micromaser with a very low linewidth.\n\n\f14\n\n106\n\nh\u03c31z iss\n\n106\n\n(a)\n\nD\n\n(b)\n\na\u2020 a\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\u22120.5\n\n102\n\n10\u22122\n\n0N\n\nN\n\nss\n\n100\n\n0.5\n5\n\nE\n\n10\u22124\n10\n\n4\n\n10\u22126\n10\u22128\n\n103\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n103\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\nw(1/s)\n1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\nw(1/s)\n102\n\n(c)\n\n100\n\n0.5\n\n(d)\n\nE\n\nh\u03c31z iss\n\nss\n\n10\u22122\n10\u22124\n\nD\n\na\u2020 a\n\n0\n\n10\u22126\n\n\u22120.5\n\n10\u22128\n\n\u22121\u22124\n10\n\n10\u22122\n\n104\n\n102\n\n100\n\nw(1/s)\n\n10\u221210 \u22124\n10\n\n10\u22122\n\n100\n\n102\n\n104\n\nw(1/s)\n\nFIG. 14.

From (c) we recover the passage of the inversion through zero for w = \u03b3a = 0.3.\nAt this point we see in (d) a rapid increase of the photon number in the mode.\n\nTo this aim the inversion of the ensemble is sustained by\nan external incoherent pump of the atoms.

The\nnumber of atoms in the ensemble is varied between 103\nand 106 , whereas the pump parameter w ranges from\n10\u22123 to 104 . In both figures we mark the pump strength\nw = \u03b3a = 0.3, for which we find the inversion becomes\npositive, with a vertical red dashed line. At this point\nwe also find a rapid increase of the number of photons in\nthe cavity. The horizontal lines mark the cross sections\nfor N = 105 shown in what follows.\nTo solve for ha\u2020^\n(t)a(0)i, we use Cramers rule on\nEq.

(Color online) Same as Fig. 14 with T2 = 0.1, which corresponds to n\u0304 = 0.04. In (d) the thermal excitations in the\nmode appear as a constant background from which the increase due to the pump stands out.\n\ntile setup for observing and testing prominent quantum\nphysics phenomena. The effectively very cold temperature and good localization of the atomic cloud allow symmetric collective strong coupling to the microwave mode.\nWhile the weak magnetic dipole coupling requires large\natom numbers and an extremely well localized microwave\nmode to obtain significant coupling, it also makes the system quite immune to external noise. In addition to the\nlong lifetime of the atomic states, this renders the system an ideal quantum memory or allows for very narrow\nspectral response or gain. As all the atoms are identical\nand well trapped, the system exhibits only a very narrow\ninhomogeneous broadening. Operated in an active way,\none thus can envisage a truly microscopic maser with an\nvery narrow linewidth directly locked to an atomic clock\ntransition. The uniform coupling and the possibility of\nefficient optical pumping enables the study of superradiant decay into the stripline mode, where a precise phase\nand intensity analysis of the emitted radiation can be\nperformed.\nWhile many of our considerations are guided by parameters expected from an ultracold atom ensemble, it is easy\nto generalize to alternative setups using NV-centers or\nother solid-state ensembles. There larger ensembles can\nbe easily envisaged but one also gets much more varying\ncoupling constants and larger inhomogeneous widths. It\nis not obvious whether the technically more simple setup\nand larger numbers in this case can compensate for these\nimperfections.\n\nThis could be particularly important for a next step:\npossible optical readout of the ensemble. For the atomic\ncase, the uniformity of the coupling over many optical\nwavelengths should allow a nice directional readout of\nthe ensemble state, once a laser could coupled in.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by a DOC-fFORTEfellowship of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the\nEuropean Union project MIDAS.\n\n\f17\ndetuning of the cavity and \u2206a = \u03c9a \u2212 \u03c9l for the detuning\nof the atoms.

This can be checked in\nprinciple by truncating at higher orders and comparing\nthe results. In general, it turns out that there is one\ncumulant which requires more care: the correlation between the inversion and the photon number a\u2020 a\u03c31z . In\n\n(A13)\n\n(A14)\n\n> 1 holds, the numthe regime where g\u03baeff > 1 and g\u03b3eff\na\nber of photons necessary to saturate the ensemble is low.\nTherefore small fluctuations of the photon number can\ncause significant changes in the inversion [24]. The correlation between the photon number and the inversion\na\u2020 a\u03c31z c is therefore kept in our calculations. Hence, an\nexpansion like in Eq. (14) would not be advantageous because none of the terms could be dropped. We therefore\ncalculate the dynamical equation for a\u2020 a\u03c31z which gives\n\nd \u2020 z\na a\u03c31 = (\u22122\u03ba \u2212 \u03b3a ) a\u2020 a\u03c31z \u2212 \u03b3a a\u2020 a + 2\u03ban\u0304 h\u03c31z i\ndt\n\u0001\u0001\n\u2212 ig a\u03c31+ \u2212 a\u2020 \u03c31\u2212 + 2 a\u2020 aa\u03c31+ \u2212 a\u2020 a\u2020 a\u03c31\u2212\n\u0001\n\u2212 ig (N \u2212 1) a\u2020 \u03c31z \u03c32\u2212 \u2212 a\u03c31z \u03c32+\n+ \u03b7 a\u2020 \u03c31z + \u03b7 \u2217 ha\u03c31z i\n\nThe expectation values of products of three operators\nare expanded as in Eq.

The\nresulting equation for a\u2020 a\u03c31z can be integrated numerically along with the equations for the other quantities\nmentioned previously.\n\n\f\u2212100\n\u221250\n50\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n\n19\n4 \u00d7 104\n\nD\n\n\u2020\nz\nwithout\nD a a\u03c3\nE\nwith a\u2020 a\u03c3 z\n\n(a)\n\n3.5\n\nc\n\nTo estimate the influence of the correlation between\nthe photon number and the inversion a\u2020 a\u03c31z c on the\ndynamics we plot the photon number in the cavity during the decay of a fully inverted ensemble. We therefore\nintegrate a set of 12 equations that is obtained if a\u2020 a\u03c31z\nis expanded and a\u2020 a\u03c31z c is neglected. For comparison\nwe also show the dynamics obtained from the full set of\n13 equations in which a\u2020 a\u03c31z c is kept [see Fig. 18 (a)].\n\nE\n\nc\n\n3\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\nD\n\na\u2020 a\n\nE\n\n2\n\n4\n\u22124\n\n1\n\n0.2\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nfrag replacements\n0.3\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nt(s)\n2 \u00d7 10\u22128\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n(b)\n\n1.8\n1.6\n\n3\n4\n\n1.2\n1\n\n0.8\n\nD\n\na\u2020 a\u03c31z\n\nE\n\nc\n\n1.4\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n2.5\n3.5\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\u03ba(1/s)\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFIG. 18.
