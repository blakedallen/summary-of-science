In\nparaxial fields the polarization ellipses lie in parallel planes oriented normal to the propagation\ndirection, but in 3D fields the ellipses generally have a wide range of spatial orientations.\nThe generic singularities of 3D ellipse fields are meandering lines of circular polarization, C\nlines, and meandering lines of linear polarization, L lines [1 \u2212 16]. Here we study the arrangement\nof the polarization ellipses surrounding C lines; the arrangements of the polarization ellipses that\nsurround L lines will be reported on separately. Where a C line pierces a plane, \u03a3, a point of\ncircular polarization, a C point, appears. Previous studies of C lines have concentrated on the\ntwo dimensional projections onto \u03a3 of those ellipses whose centers lie in this plane on a circle that\nencloses the C point. Examining the full 3D arrangement of these ellipses, we find that their\nmajor and minor axes generate M\u00f6bius strips with either one or three half-twists; examples of such\nstrips are shown in Fig. 1.\n\na1\n\na2\n\na3\n\nb1\n\nb2\n\nb3\n\nFIG. 1: M\u00f6bius strips surrounding C lines in a computed random optical field. The strips shown here are\ngenerated by the major axes of the ellipses located on a small circle that encircles the line. The M\u00f6bius\nstrips in (a1 )\u2212(a3 ) contain a single half-twist, those in (b1 )\u2212(b3 ) three half-twists. (a1 ) and (b1 ) are overall\nviews of the strips that show their 3D structure. Here ellipse centers are shown by small gray dots, the\nmajor axes of the ellipses by thin straight lines, and the endpoints of these axes by small black dots. (a2 )\nand (b2 ) show the circular strips in (a1 ) and (b1 ) cut open and straightened to better display the twist\nstructure. Here the ellipse centers form the thick central line, and, for clarity, only one half of the ellipse\naxes are shown (thin straight lines). The small white (black) circles mark the endpoints of the first (last)\nellipse, and serve to emphasize the twist structure; when the strips are closed these ellipses are adjacent,\nbut their endpoints lie on opposite sides of the circle of ellipse centers. (a3 ) and (b3 ) are views from above\nthat illustrate the fact that these strips, which have an odd number of half-twists, have not only one side,\nbut also have only one edge. Here the centers of the ellipses are shown by gray circles, the endpoints of\nellipse axes that lie above (below) the plane of ellipse centers by white (black) circles. Starting at the\nhighest point on the \"top\" edge (white arrow) and traversing a 360o circuit along this edge one arrives at\nthe \"bottom\" edge (black arrow). Continuing in the same direction along a second 360o circuit one returns\nto one's starting point on the \"top\" edge, showing that there is, in fact, only a single edge to the strip. The\nellipse endpoints in (b3 ) can be seen to form a trefoil knot, whereas those in (a3 ) do not form a knot.\n\n\f3\nThe three orthogonal principal axes of the (always planar, [17, Sect. 1.4]) polarization ellipse\nare its major and minor axes, and the normal to the ellipse. On a C line the major and minor\naxes of the ellipse become equal, and the ellipse degenerates into a circle, the C circle. Because a\ncircle has no preferred direction, its major and minor axes are undefined (singular). The normal\nto the C circle, however, remains well defined, as do all three principal axes of the ellipses that\nsurround the C line. The projections of the major and minor axes of the ellipses whose centers\nlie in a plane \u03a3 pierced by a C line rotate about the C point, generically with winding number\n(net rotation or winding angle divided by 2\u03c0) I = \u00b11/2 [1, 3, 10]. Examples of such rotations are\nshown in Fig. 2 for the major axis; in all known cases, for a given C point the winding number of\nthe projections of the minor axes onto \u03a3 is the same as that of the major axes [1, 3, 10]\nz\n\nz\n\nz\n\ny\n\ny\n\ny\n\ny\n\nz\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\nFIG. 2: C point winding number I. Shown in panels (a) and (b) ((c) and (d)) are C point M\u00f6bius strips with\none (three) half-twists, upper panels, and their projections onto the xy-plane, lower panels. As in Figs. 1a\nand 1b, in the upper panels ellipse centers are shown by small gray dots, major axes of the ellipses are shown\nby thin straight lines, and the endpoints of these axes by small black dots. The central black dot is the C\npoint. In the lower panels the ellipse centers form the black circle, and the projections of the ellipse axes\nare shown by short straight lines. During one 360o circuit around the C point in say the counterclockwise\ndirection, in (a) and (c) ((b) and (d)) these lines rotate by 180o in the same counterclockwise (opposite,\nclockwise) direction as the circuit, and I = +1/2 (\u22121/2).\n\nWinding number I and a geometrical index described later, the line index [1, 3, 18], fully characterize the projections in Fig. 2; together these indices lead to the currently known three distinct\nC lines [1, 3]. As is evident from Fig. 2, however, these projections of the major/minor axes are\ninsufficient to determine the properties, or even the existence, of the parent M\u00f6bius strips. In\nlater sections we introduce one new geometrical, and seven new topological indices to characterize\nthese strips; together these eight new indices increase the number of distinct C lines by a factor of\n\u223c 350.\nThe plan of this report is as follows: In Section II we describe the analytical and numerical\ntools used in the computer simulations employed in later sections to study 3D ellipse fields, their\nC lines, their M\u00f6bius strips, and related structures. These tools are similar to those we used to\nstudy the one-full-twist M\u00f6bius strips that surround ordinary (i.e. nonsingular) ellipses [14, 15]. In\nSection III we describe in detail the M\u00f6bius strips and related structures that surround C lines,\nintroduce the new indices that characterize these lines, and extend the important line classification\nof C points [1, 3, 18]; although this classification does not involve an invariant topological index, it\ndoes serve to further characterize the arrangement of the ellipses that surround these points. In\nSection IV we present statistical data for the relative occurrences in random fields of the many\ndifferent C lines. We summarize our main findings in the concluding Section V.\n\n\f4\nCoherent measurement techniques permit the determination (amplitude and phase) of all three\northogonally polarized components of 3D microwave fields [6, 7, 19, 20]; recent advances in interferometric nanoprobes provide similar capabilities for optical fields [21 \u2212 28]. It is therefore now\npossible to carry out experiments that can measure the highly unusual structures described here.\nC lines are degeneracies of the matrix that describes the 3D polarization ellipse [9, 29, 30]. Other\nphysical systems such as liquid crystals, strain fields, flow fields, etc., are described by similar matrices whose degeneracies can be expected to yield analogs of C lines that are likely to be surrounded\nby M\u00f6bius strips.\nAt present there are no known practical applications for optical M\u00f6bius strips; as these strange,\nengrossing objects become better understood, however, useful applications may emerge.\nII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nAs indicated in the Introduction, the only well defined direction associated with a C point is\nthe normal to the C circle. We call the plane that is perpendicular to this preferred direction, i.e.\nthe plane of the C circle, the principal plane, and denote this plane by \u03a30 . We emphasize that\n\u03a30 need not be, and in general is not, perpendicular to the C line, and that the orientation of the\nprincipal plane relative to the C line changes as one moves along the line [1, 3, 8 \u2212 10, 13 \u2212 15].\nA.\n\nEllipse Axes\n\nHere we describe the methods we use to calculate the axes of the polarization ellipses that\ngenerate the M\u00f6bius strips surrounding C points and C lines.\nWe label the major and minor axes of, and the normal to, the general polarization ellipse by \u03b1,\n\u03b2, and \u03b3, respectively. Given an expression for the (here complex) optical field E, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3,\ncan be calculated in two seemingly different ways. The first, due to Berry [8, 10], is\n\u221a\n(1a)\n\u03b1 = Re(E\u2217 E * E),\n\u221a\n\u03b2 = Im(E\u2217 E * E),\n(1b)\n\u03b3 = Im (E\u2217 \u00d7E) .\n\n(1c)\n\nThe second involves finding the three eigenvalues, \u03bbi , and three normalized eigenvectors, \u03bd i , i =\n1, 2, 3, of the 3 \u00d7 3 real coherency matrix,\nMij = Re(Ei\u2217 Ej ); i, j = x, y, z.\n\n(2)\n\nThe largest eigenvalue, here \u03bb3 , is associated with the major axis of the polarization ellipse, the\nnext largest eigenvalue, \u03bb2 , with the minor axis, and the smallest eigenvalue \u03bb1 \u2261 0, with the\nnormal to the ellipse.\n\u03bb1 \u2261 0 because for the monochromatic fields assumed here the polarization ellipse is always\nplanar\n\u221a [17]. In terms of \u03bb, the length a of the\u221amajor axis of the polarization ellipse is given by\na = \u03bb3 , the length b of the minor axis by b = \u03bb2 .\nThe above two seemingly different methods are reconciled by noting that \u03b1/ |\u03b1| = \u03bd 3 , \u03b2/ |\u03b2| =\n\u03bd 2 , and \u03b3/ |\u03b3| = \u03bd 1 . Although an analytical proof of these equalities is still lacking, we note that\nin every one of the literally hundreds of cases studied these equalities were found to hold to within\nnumerical accuracy. In what follows, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 are, without change of notation, understood to\neach be normalized to unit length.\nAs we move through the wavefield, in order\u221ato ensure that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are smooth, continuous,\nsingle valued functions of position, we calculate E * E as follows: We write E*E =Ex2 +Ey2 +Ez2 =\n\n\f5\nA exp (i\u03c6),\n\u221a unfold (unwrap) \u03c6 as needed to eliminate spurious discontinuities of 2\u03c0, and then write\n\u221a\nE * E= A exp (i\u03c6/2).\nAlthough the polarization ellipse has inversion symmetry, \u03b3 in Eq. (1c) is an axial vector that\ndefines a unique positive direction. This direction, which is determined via a right hand rule from\nthe way E traces out the polarization ellipse in time, permits us to define a unique orthogonal xyz\ncoordinate system in which the positive z-axis is along the positive direction of \u03b3, the x and y axes\nare along \u03b1 and \u03b2, and xyz form a right-handed 3-frame.\nC lines may be located in two different ways: The first is to locate the zeros of E * E [8 \u2212 10].\nThe second is to locate the zeros of the C point discriminant DC = a21 \u2212 4a2 ; this discriminant is\nobtained from the characteristic equation \u03bb2 + a1 \u03bb + a2 = 0 of the real coherency matrix Mij in\nEq. (2) [29]. As expected, both methods were found to yield the same result.\nB.\n\nAxis Projections\n\nHaving traced out a C line, we move along the line to some C point and find \u03b3 for that point.\nAs noted above, \u03b3 for a given point is the positive normal to \u03a30 at the point. In looking at the\nellipses in \u03a30 we will always look down the positive z-axis (i.e. +z points towards us).\nIn constructing the M\u00f6bius strips and their projections we focus on those ellipses whose centers\nlie in \u03a30 on a small circle that surrounds the C point. We call these ellipses the surrounding ellipses\nand label the corresponding circle \u03c30 . For convenience, we take the center of \u03c30 to coincide with\nthe C point, although any other simple path in \u03a30 centered on the C point yields the same result\nfor the various topological indices as does \u03c30 .\nIn addition to projecting the ellipse axes onto \u03a30 , we study two other projections. The first,\nand most important, we call the \u03c40 projection. In this projection we erect a rotating plane, the \u03c40\nplane. \u03c40 is oriented normal to \u03a30 , contains the normal to the C circle, axis \u03b3 (the +z axis), and\nrotates around this axis. Where \u03c30 pierces the plane we establish an orthogonal X0 Z0 -coordinate\nsystem. The angle of rotation \u03c70 of the plane \u03c40 is measured counterclockwise from the fixed\n(laboratory) x-axis in \u03a30 . Projected onto \u03c40 is the axis of the ellipse whose center lies in \u03c30 at\nthe point where \u03c40 intercepts this circle; we label this point P0 . P0 , of course, moves along \u03c30 as\n\u03c70 increases 0 \u2212 2\u03c0. Fig. 3a displays the relevant geometry.\nThe second projection we call the \u03c00 projection. In this projection we erect another rotating\nplane, the \u03c00 plane. Like \u03c40 , \u03c00 is oriented normal to \u03a30 , but unlike \u03c40 , \u03c00 is tangent to \u03c30 . We\nestablish an orthogonal Y0 Z0 -coordinate system at the point of tangentsy, the point P0 , such that\nthe triplet X0 Y0 Z0 forms a right handed coordinate system. The same angle, \u03c70 , that measures\nthe rotation of \u03c40 measures the rotation of \u03c00 . Projected onto \u03c00 is the axis of the ellipse whose\ncenter lies at P0 . Fig. 3b illustrates the geometry of this case.\nThus, in determining the geometrical and topological properties of the 3D M\u00f6bius strips formed\nby a given axis we use three orthogonal projections \u2212 the minimum number of projections required\nfor the characterization of a three-dimensional object.\nIn general, there are therefore nine different projections: the projections onto the three planes\n\u03a3, \u03c4 , and \u03c0, of each of the three axes \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 of the ellipses on \u03c3. Although these projections\nare interconnected, as becomes apparent, they yield a multitude of different topological winding\nnumbers This may appear surprising because, after all, the three-frame \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 has only three\nrotational degrees of freedom. But the properties of the M\u00f6bius strips depend on the rotations of\nall the ellipses on \u03c30 . These ellipses are unbounded in number, and their three-frames can rotate\nindependently, subject only to the restrictions of continuity. A practical, albeit not fundamental,\nfurther restriction is introduced by the fact that sufficiently close to the C point a linear expansion of\nthe field suffices to determine what happens in the generic case. As becomes apparent, this leads\n\n\f6\nto additional interconnections between indices, and forbidden combinations of indices (selection\nrules), so that structures that are allowed in principle by geometrical and topological constraints\nmay not appear in practice.\n\n\u03c40\nZ0\n\n+z\n\n\u03b1\n+z\n\n+y\n\nX0\n\n\u03c00\nY0\n\n\u03b1\n\nP0\n\nX0\n\nP0\n\n+x\n\n+x\n\n\u03c70\n\n\u03c70\n\n\u03c30\n\n\u03a30\n\nZ0\n\n+y\n\n\u03c30\n\n\u03a30\n\na\n\nb\n\nFIG. 3: Projections \u03c40 and \u03c00 .

The first is a field\ncomposed of a large number of randomly phased, linearly polarized plane waves with random\npolarization and random propagation directions. This speckle field (speckle pattern), described in\nfull detail in [13 \u2212 15], has the advantage that it is an is an exact solution of Maxwell's equations.\nIt has two disadvantages, however: The first is that C lines must be found and followed empirically,\nusing a time consuming search based on either the zeros of E * E, or the discriminant DC of the\ncoherency matrix described above. Thus, the number of different lines that can be studied is\nlimited, and as a result, a limited menu of different M\u00f6bius strips is available for detailed study.\nNonetheless, this random field serves as our gold standard, and is used to verify the existence of\nthe structures measured with the aid of the linear expansion described below.\n2.\n\nLinear Expansion\n\nLocating the origin at an arbitrary point in a generic complex optical field, the three Cartesian\ncomponents of the field in the immediate vicinity of the point can be expanded to first order (the\norder required here) as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \uf8f6\nEx\nax + ibx\nPxx + iQxx Pxy + iQxy Pxz + iQxz\nx\n\uf8ed Ey \uf8f8 = \uf8ed ay + iby \uf8f8 + \uf8ed Pyx + iQyx Pyy + iQyy Pyz + iQyz \uf8f8 \uf8ed y \uf8f8 ,\n(3)\nEz\naz + ibz\nPzx + iQzx Pzy + iQzy Pzz + iQzz\nz\nwhere, for example, Pxy = Re (\u2202Ex /\u2202y)0 , Qxy = Im (\u2202Ex /\u2202y)0 , etc. The divergence condition\n\u2207 * E = 0 can be satisfied by setting Pzz = \u2212 (Pxx + Pyy ), and Qzz = \u2212 (Qxx + Qyy ).\n\n\f7\nAt the selected point, which can have arbitrary elliptical polarization, we erect a convenient\ncoordinate system in which the +z-axis is along the positive normal \u03b3 to the plane of the ellipse,\nthe x-axis is along the major ellipse axis \u03b1, and the y-axis is along the minor axis \u03b2. In this\ncoordinate system the plane z = 0 is the principal plane \u03a30 of the ellipse at the origin.\nWhen the point at the origin is a C point on a C line, the condition (E * E)0 = 0 can be satisfied\nby setting ay = az = 0, bx = bz = 0, and ay = \u00b1 |ax |. Thus, in \u03a30 all constraints are satisfied\nwithout loss of generality by writing for a C point\nEx = a + (Pxx + iQxx ) x + (Pxy + iQxy ) y,\n\n(4a)\n\nEy = is |a| + (Pyx + iQyx ) x + (Pyy + iQyy ) y,\n\n(4b)\n\nEz = (Pzx + iQzx ) x + (Pzy + iQzy ) y,\n\n(4c)\n\nwhere s = \u00b11, and a and the P and Q remaining in Eq. (4) are unconstrained.\nSimpler expansions are also possible. The one-half-twist Mobius strip in Fig. 1a is closely\napproximated by Ex = \u22121 \u2212 (1 \u2212 i) y, Ey = \u2212i + x, Ez = \u2212ix + y, the three-half-twist strip in Fig.\n1b by Ex = 1 \u2212 y, Ey = i \u2212 x, Ez = y.\nWe make contact with the random speckle field described above by generating the various\nconstants in Eq. (4) with the aid of the procedure described below: this procedure is appropriate\nto a random field whose components obey circular Gaussian statistics, and ensures that the M\u00f6bius\nstrips we study have generic properties that are likely to correspond to those in real physical fields.\nWe start by writing the joint probability density function (PDF) P of the three Cartesian field\ncomponents in Eq. (3), which describes a general point in the fixed laboratory xyz frame, as\nP (Ex , Ey , Ez ) = P (Ex ) P (Ey ) P (Ez ) ,\nP (Ej ) = P (aj , bj , Pjx , ..., Qjz ) , j = x, y, z\nP (aj , bj , Pjx , ..., Qjz ) = PG (aj ) PG (bj ) PG (Pjx ) ...PG (Qjz ) ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nu2\n1\nexp \u2212\n.\nPG (u) = p\n2 hu2 i\n2\u03c0 hu2 i\n\n(5a)\n(5b)\n(5c)\n(5d)\n\nBut we want P (Ex , Ey , Ez ) not at a general point, but at a special point, a C point, and not in\nthe fixed laboratory xyz frame, but in the principal axis x\u2032 y \u2032 z \u2032 frame of the C point. Accordingly,\nwe proceed numerically as follows. In accord with Eq. (5) we first choose the sign of s and\nthe values of the various a, b, P, and Q in Eq. (3) by consulting a random number generator\nthat produces a Gaussian distribution with, for convenience, unit variance. We then adjust the\nparameters a and b so as to satisfy (E * E)0 = 0, writing az and bz in terms of ax , ay , bx , by . Next,\nwe find the eigenvectors of the coherency matrix in Eq. (2); these eigenvectors yield the direction\ncosines of the principal axes x\u2032 y \u2032 z \u2032 of the C point relative to the laboratory xyz frame. As discussed\nabove, eigenvector \u03bd 1 is the well defined normal to the C circle (axis \u03b3), whereas \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 3 are\narbitrary orthogonal directions in the plane of the C circle.\nWe form a matrix D from these direction cosines, and use it to transform the parameters a,\nb, P , and Q, in the laboratory frame to a parameter set a\u2032 , b\u2032 , P \u2032 , and Q\u2032 in the principal axis\nframe of the C point. Forming a vector a (vector b) from the a (b) parameters, and matrices P\nand Q from the P and Q parameters, respectively, and transforming both coordinates and field\ncomponents, we obtain\na\u2032 = D * a,\n\n(6a)\n\n\u2032\n\nb = D * b,\n\n(6b)\n\nP\u2032 = D * P * D\u22121 ,\n\u2032\n\nQ =D*Q*D\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\n(6c)\n(6d)\n\n\f8\n\u0001\nAs expected, we find a\u2032z = b\u2032z = 0. Writing a\u2032x + ib\u2032x = A\u2032x exp (i\u03c6\u2032x ), a\u2032y + ib\u2032y = A\u2032y exp i\u03c6\u2032y ,\nwe find, again as expected, A\u2032x = A\u2032y and \u03c6\u2032x \u2212 \u03c6\u2032y = \u03c0/2. But this is not yet in the convenient\nform of Eq. (4). We complete the transformation by writing E\u2032\u2032 = exp(\u2212ib\u2032x /a\u2032x )E\u2032 , extract the\nreal and imaginary parts of E\u2032\u2032 , set z = 0, and after dropping for convenience the double prime\nsuperscripts obtain Eq. (4)\nThe individual PDFs of P \u2032 and Q\u2032 remain circular Gaussians with unit variance. This is\nnot surprising, because P and Q are transformed under a similarity transformation in which the\narguments of the cosines in D are uniformly distributed 0 \u2212 2\u03c0. The above procedure is required\nbecause it preserves specific correlations between the final P \u2032\u2032 and Q\u2032\u2032 that are absent in the initial\nP and Q; these correlations arise because the elements of D are themselves functions of P and Q\n[15].\nIn contrast to the PDFs of P and Q, the PDF of a, shown in Fig. 4, differs markedly from a\nGaussian.\n0.35\n0.3\n\nPDF(a)\n\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\na\n\nFIG. 4: Final PDF of a in Eq. (4).\n\nAlthough Eq. (4) appears to describe an isolated C point at the origin, this C point is, in fact,\npart of a continuous C line. In addition to the C point at the origin, Eq. (4) can also produce\none or more parasitic C points (C lines) at locations that depend upon the various parameters.\nAs long as the surrounding circle \u03c30 is sufficiently small that it does not contain, or come close\nto, these parasitic C points they cause no trouble. Occasionally, with a probability of \u223c 1 \u2212 2%,\na parasitic C point is so close to the C point at the origin that it strongly distorts the field in\nthe region of the central point. When this happens the M\u00f6bius strip at the origin can become so\ndistorted that its parameters cannot be accurately measured. In Section IV where we discuss the\nstatistics of the strips we eliminate such cases (outliers) from the analysis.\nD.\n\nGraphics\n\nWe discuss here three important aspects of the graphic representation of the M\u00f6bius strips and\nother wavefield structures that are presented throughout this report.\n\n\f9\n1.\n\nLength scales\n\nWe start by noting that there is no geometric or, indeed any, relationship between the radius\nof \u03c30 , which is a true length, and the length of the line used to represent an ellipse axis.\nThe length scale of \u03c30 is set by the variances of the Gaussian distributions in Eq. (5) that\nare used for the constants a and b, which measure the field amplitude, and the derivatives P and\nQ, that measure the change in field strength per unit length. We take the field and derivative\nvariances to be unity, which fixes the length scale of \u03c30 to also be unity. When the radius r0\nof \u03c30 is sufficiently small (i.e. small compared to one), the field scales uniformly with r0 and its\nstructure becomes independent of this radius. Here, we take r0 = 10\u22124 , having verified that this\nis \"sufficiently small\" in the above sense.\nAlthough the length scale of the field is also unity, the length scale of the polarization ellipse\nremains arbitrary. The reason is that the ellipse is a representation of the magnitude and direction\nof the electric field vector over an optical cycle at a point. We can therefore choose any convenient\nscale to represent the ellipse, because in the physical field two arbitrarily close ellipses do not\noverlap. Thus, the widths of the ribbons representing the M\u00f6bius strips in Figs. 1 and 2, and in\nall other figures presented here, are adjusted as needed for clarity. Of course, in a given figure a\nsingle length scale is used for all ellipses.\n2.\n\nScaling\n\nBy continuity, the tilt of the plane of the ellipses on \u03c30 relative to the plane \u03a30 , the plane of\nthe C circle, decreases to zero as the radius r0 goes to zero. This tilt is of order r0 , which for\nr0 = 10\u22124 is of order 0.005o . In later figures (such as Figs. 7 \u2212 12) we will show the projections\nof the ellipse axes onto the XZ-plane or the Y Z-plane of Fig. 3, i.e. the planes \u03c40 and \u03c00 . In\nsuch figures we use anisotropic scaling, expanding the Z-axis relative to the X- or Y -axis so as\nto make visible the relative tilts of the axes of different ellipses, the absolute values of these tilts\nbeing unimportant in these figures.\n3.\n\nPaths\n\nAs mentioned, we choose \u03c30 to be a circle centered on the C point for simplicity \u2212 other simple\npaths such as ellipses centered on the C point yield the same values for the topological indices as\ndoes \u03c30 . The path must be \"centered \" because when shrunk to zero it must enclose the C point\nThe choice of a circle centered on the C point yields the most symmetrical possible form for\nthe M\u00f6bius strips, enhancing our ability to understand their sometimes complex structures. But\neven within the domain of circles there is nothing special about a radius of say r0 = 10\u22124 \u2212\nr0 = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 , or any other value, is obviously equally good. From this follows that the C point\nis surrounded by an infinite set of centered nested M\u00f6bius strips.\nIt is, of course, difficult, if not impossible, to visualize the full 3D structure of such a field.\nBelow we dissect out a single representative M\u00f6bius strip of the nested strips that surrounds C\npoints, the \u03c30 M\u00f6bius strip, and proceed to study this strip in detail.\nIII.\n\nM\u00d6BIUS STRIP INDICES\n\nThroughout this report we restrict ourselves to the case in which the plane of observation \u03a3\ncoincides with the principal plane \u03a30 . In this plane we find that all indices are the same for axes\n\n\f10\n\u03b1 and \u03b2, even though the detailed geometries of the M\u00f6bius strips generated by these axes are\ndifferent. For simplicity and uniformity, in what follows all examples presented are for axis \u03b1. As\n\u03a3 rotates away from \u03a30 a complex set of phenomena set in: the universal equivalence between\naxes \u03b1 and \u03b2 is broken, right-handed M\u00f6bius strips transform into left-handed one, and vice versa,\none-half-twist strips change to three-half twist strips, and vice versa, indices abruptly change sign,\netc. These phenomena will be reported on separately.\nA.\n\nTopological Indices of the Projection onto \u03a30\n1.\n\nIndices I\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nAs indicated in the Introduction, the sole topological index used in previous studies to characterize C points and C lines is based on the rotation about the C point of the projections onto \u03a3\nof the major or minor axes of the ellipses on the surrounding circle \u03c3. When \u03a3 = \u03a30 (so that\n\u03c3 = \u03c30 ) it is easily seen that index I (Fig. 2) is the same for both axis \u03b1 and axis \u03b2: sufficiently\nclose to the C point the surrounding ellipses are tilted negligibly out of the plane \u03a30 , the plane of\nthe C circle, so that the projections of \u03b1 and \u03b2 onto \u03a30 are very nearly orthogonal at all points on\n\u03c30 . Thus, these projections are locked together, and as one rotates so does the other: as a result,\nIa = I\u03b2 . This is true even when \u03a3 6= \u03a30 . As expected, we find that in our simulations Ia = I\u03b2 in\nall cases (\u03a3 = \u03a30 , and \u03a3 6= \u03a30 ): accordingly in what follows we write this index as Ia,\u03b2 .\nGenerically, Ia,\u03b2 = \u00b11/2 [1, 3]. This is not due to geometric or topological constraints, but\nis rather a consequence of the linear expansion; when higher order terms dominate, higher order\nvalues for this index are possible [32]. Half integer values for Ia,\u03b2 can occur because of the\nsymmetry of the ellipse which returns to itself after rotation by \u03c0; for the rotations of a vector, for\nexample, only integer values for the index are possible.\nHidden in the diagrams that illustrate Ia,\u03b2 lie long overlooked clues to the fact that these 2D\ndiagrams are projections of 3D M\u00f6bius strips. These clues are discussed in Fig. 5\n2.\n\nIndex I\u03b3\n\nWhat about the projection onto \u03a30 of axis \u03b3 of the ellipses on \u03c30 ? As shown in Fig. 6, these\nprojections rotate about the C point with integer winding number I\u03b3 = \u00b11. I\u03b3 = \u00b11 because \u03b3\nis a vector. But wait! Axis \u03b3 is well defined at the C point, and normally we associate winding\nnumbers with singularities, i.e. with properties that are undefined; for example winding number\nIa,\u03b2 is associated with the fact that axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 are undefined at the C point. So is I\u03b3 a valid\ntopological index, or not?\nIn answering this question in the affirmative we note the following: Although axis \u03b3 is well\ndefined, its projection onto \u03a30 is singular. The reason is that although the projection of this axis\nfor all the surrounding ellipses are lines with well defined directions, the projection of axis \u03b3 for\nthe C point itself is a point whose direction is undefined. Thus, in \u03a30 , axis \u03b3 and axes \u03b1 and \u03b2\nbehave similarly, both projections have undefined directions \u2212 axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 because the C circle\nhas no preferred direction, axis \u03b3 because a point (a circle of vanishingly small radius) also has no\npreferred direction.\nThe above comparison is closer still if instead of plotting the projections of the ellipses we plot\nthe quantities given in Eq. (1). As defined there, \u03b1 and \u03b2 go to zero at a C point, and maps of\nthe projections of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, are similar \u2212 all three maps show a point at the location of the C\npoint surrounded by lines that rotate about the point with winding number of \u00b11/2 (\u00b11) for axes\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 (axis \u03b3).\n\n\f11\nu\n\nt\np\no\n\ns\n\n1\n\nq\n\n0,2\n\nq\n\np\n\nw\n\nt\no\n\n1\nv\n\nu\n\nr\n\nw\n\nr\n\n0,2\n\ns\n\na\n\nv\n\nb\n\nFIG. 5: Hidden clues. As shown in Fig. 2, in determining I\u03b1,\u03b2 one traditionally focuses on the rotation of\nthe projections onto \u03a30 of the major or minor axes of the ellipses on the surrounding circle \u03c30 . It is amusing\nto note in retrospect that these diagrams contain an important clue overlooked during the twenty five years\nsince their inception. If instead of focusing on the rotation of the axes (here, as in Fig. 2, the thin straight\nlines) one focuses instead on the axis endpoints (small black dots), it immediately becomes apparent that\nthe flat ribbon formed by the axes has, just like the parent M\u00f6bius strip, only one edge. Starting at the\npoint labeled 0 and proceeding counterclockwise along the edge (o \u2192 p \u2192 ... \u2192 v \u2192 w), after one 360o\ncircuit around the C point (central large black dot) one reaches the point labeled 1. Continuing along a\nsecond circuit one returns to the point labeled 2, which, because it is coincident with the starting point 0,\ndemonstrates that the axis ribbon has only a single edge. The single self intersection of the curve formed by\nthe endpoints in (a), which is Fig. 2a redrawn, suggests (but of course does not prove) the possible existence\nof a one-half-twist M\u00f6bius strip, whereas the three self intersections of this curve in (b), which is Fig. 2d\nredrawn, suggests (but, again, does not prove - see Fig. 2b) the possible existence of a three-half-twist\nM\u00f6bius strip.\n\nFinally, we recall the well known maxim that the index of a path (here the circle \u03c30 ) is a property\nof the path. The index of the path becomes the index of the C point by a limiting process in\nwhich we shrink the path onto the point and observe that the index remains invariant under this\ntransformation. I\u03b3 satisfies this criterion also.\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nFIG. 6: Index I\u03b3 . (a) and (b) I\u03b3 = +1. (c) I\u03b3 = \u22121. Here the gray ellipse facilitates following the\nretrograde rotation of the axes. The thick black markers and radial lines in (b) and in (c) relate to the line\nclassification, and are discussed in Section III.D.2.\n\nWhat is the three dimensional structure generated by axis \u03b3? As can be seen in Fig. 7 it is a\nsegment of a cone, not a M\u00f6bius strip. This cone is analogous to the cones described previously\nthat surround ordinary, i.e. nonsingular, points [14, 15].\n\n\f12\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nFIG. 7: \u03b3 cones. (a), (b), and (c), respectively, are 3D views of the cones that produce projections (a), (b),\nand (c) in Fig. 6.\nB.\n\nTopological Indices of the Projection onto \u03c40\n\nThe classic construction of a M\u00f6bius strip, known to middle-school children everywhere, is as\nfollows: take a strip of paper, twist one end through a half turn, and glue the two ends together.\nA similar construction serves to model the optical M\u00f6bius strips discussed here: attach short rods\n(representing ellipse axes \u03b1 or \u03b2) at their midpoints to a strip of flexible material, introduce one\nor three half-twists, and connect together the ends of the twisted strip.\nThe strip can be twisted in one of two senses to form either a right- or left-handed screw.\nRotating the ends of the strip to bring them together can also be done in one of two ways, when\nviewed from, say, above, either clockwise or counterclockwise. But the geometry and topology of\nthe strip remain the same whichever choice (clockwise or counterclockwise) is made, and only the\nsense (right- or left-handed) and number (one or three) of the initial half-twists determines the\nnature of the strip.\nIn the remainder of this report we drop for convenience the subscript \"0\" on r0, X0 , Y0 , Z0 , and\n\u03c70 , its presence being understood.\n1.\n\nIndices \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nFollowing the (unfortunate) convention mandated for circularly polarized light, namely that the\nleft-handed (right-handed) screw traced out in space by the rotation of the electric vector as the\nlight propagates is labelled right-handed (left-handed) polarization, we attach a positive (negative)\nsign to left (right) handed M\u00f6bius strips. Adding in the number of half twists, we find four possible\nvalues for the twist index \u03c4 , \u03c4 = \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2.\n\u03c4 can be obtained by following the rotation of the ellipse axes projected onto the rotating plane\n\u03c40 . We label this projection T, and illustrate the procedure in Fig. 8. Here the angle \u03b6 relative\nto the X-axis is measured as \u03b6 (\u03c7) = arctan (TZ (\u03c7) , TX (\u03c7)), where, Fig. 3a, \u03c7 measures position\non \u03c30 . \u03b6 (\u03c7) is unfolded (unwrapped) as required, and \u03c4 is computed as \u03c4 = \u2206\u03b6/2\u03c0, where\n\u2206\u03b6 = \u03b6 (2\u03c0) \u2212 \u03b6 (0).\nAlthough not an obvious geometrical or topological necessity, we find in \u03a30 (and only in \u03a30 )\nthat in all cases the values of \u03c4 obtained for axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 are always the same, even though the\ndetailed geometry of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 Mobius strips may differ substantially. Accordingly, here we\nlabel this index \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 . In Section III.D.1 we show that within the linear approximation only oneand three-half-twist M\u00f6bius strips are possible, so that generically \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2.\n\n\f13\n\na\n\nb\n\nZ\n\nTZ\n\nT\n\nZ\n\nT\n\n\u03b6\n\nTx\n\nX\nX\n\nFIG. 8: Index \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 . (a) M\u00f6bius strip with a single half-twist. This strip is the one shown in Fig. 1a.\nThe origin of vector T is on \u03c30 (gray circle) whereas its head terminates on the projections onto \u03c40 of the\nendpoints of the surrounding ellipse axes (small black dots). T begins a 2\u03c0 circuit on \u03c30 at the the small\nwhite circle, and in the case shown here rotates clockwise through 180o to the large black dot that terminates\nthe curve of endpoints. Here and throughout, this black dot is connected by a thin straight line to the initial\nwhite dot in order to emphasize that these two points terminate opposite ends of the same ellipse axis. The\nposition of T relative to the X-axis is measured by angle \u03b6 = arctan (TZ , TX ). At the start (end) of the\ncircuit shown here \u03b6 = 135o (\u03b6 = \u221245o). The net rotation is therefore \u2206\u03b6 = \u221245o \u2212 135o = \u2212180o, and\n\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22121/2. (b) M\u00f6bius strip with three half-twists. This strip is the one shown in Fig. 1b. Here T\nrotates counterclockwise through +540o over a 2\u03c0 circuit on \u03c30 , rotating by a little less than 360o over the\nlower loop and by a little more than 180o over the upper one. \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 is therefore \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = +3/2. The starting\npoint on \u03c30 is arbitrary, and choosing a different starting point for the circuit changes the initial and final\nvalues of \u03b6, but not their difference \u2206\u03b6. Although by convention we traverse \u03c30 in the counterclockwise\ndirection as viewed from the positive end of \u03b3, the +z direction in Fig. 3a, traversing \u03c30 in the opposite,\nclockwise, direction does not change either the sign or magnitude of \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 . This reflects the fact that the\nhandedness of a screw \u2212 right or left \u2212 remains the same when the screw is viewed from any direction.\n\na. Phase ratchet rules As T rotates its endpoint traces out one of the the curves shown\nin Fig. 8. The signed (plus for counterclockwise, minus for clockwise) crossings of this curve\nwith the X and Z-axes can be used to determine \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 by means of a minor variation of what we\ncalled the \"phase ratchet rules\" [31]. For a one-half-twist M\u00f6bius strip in a 2\u03c0 (4\u03c0) circuit on\n\u03c30 , Fig. 8a, the vector T rotates through \u03c0 (2\u03c0), and the endpoint curve crossing sequence is\nXZ (XZXZ), or its cyclic permutation. For a three-half-twist strip T rotates through 3\u03c0 (6\u03c0),\nFig. 8b, and the endpoint curve crossing sequence is XZXZXZ (XZXZXZXZXZXZ), or its\ncyclic permutation. An important complication, however is that the rotation of T is generally not\nmonotonic, and T can, and often does, wander back and forth during its overall rotation, leading\nto additional crossings of the endpoint curve with the XZ-axes. Here the phase ratchet rules come\ninto play: these rules state that adjacent terms of the same axis in the crossing sequence (these\nterms necessarily have opposite signs) are to be erased; thus, the sequence XZZZ for a 2\u03c0 circuit,\nfor example, is reduced to XZ, indicating that the M\u00f6bius strip has a single half-twist. These\nrules are illustrated in Fig. 9.\n2.\n\nIndices d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nAs is evident from the phase ratchet rules, the complicated shape of the endpoint curve in\nFig. 9a is not fully characterized by \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 ; here we discuss a second topological invariant that\nadds additional information about such curves. (A complete characterization of the curve would\nrequire, of course, an infinite set of indices or moments.)\n\n\f14\nZ\n\nX\n\nT\n\na\n\nb\n\nFIG. 9: Phase ratchet rules. (a) Endpoint curve. (b) M\u00f6bius strip. For the M\u00f6bius strip shown in\n(b) the endpoint curve in (a) is a complicated figure with multiple crossings of the X and Z axes. As a\nresult, the rotation of the vector T is so complicated that its net angle of rotation cannot be determined\nvisually. The phase ratchet rules simplify the calculation and permit \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 to be obtained by inspection. In\napplying the rules one first lists the signed crossings of the endpoint curve with the X and Z axes in the\norder that they occur as one traverses the curve. Starting at the small white circle and proceeding along\nthe curve, the sequence of signed crossings is Z+ Z\u2212 X\u2212 X+ X\u2212 Z\u2212 , where subscript + (\u2212) indicates that T\nrotates counterclockwise (clockwise) at the crossing. Applying the phase ratchet rules one erases adjacent\nterms in the same axis, in this case the terms Z+ Z\u2212 and X\u2212 X+ , or X+ X\u2212 , to obtain X\u2212 Z\u2212 . From this\ncanonical sequence it immediately follows, Fig. 8a, that \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22121/2. The Mobius strip shown in (b) can\nbe generated from an ordinary right-handed half-twist strip by grasping a segment of the ribbon between\nthumb and forefinger and twisting the segment by \u223c 180o (see the arrow in (b)). This introduces a pair\nof twists \u2212 one right-handed and the other left-handed. Although this operation changes the geometry of\nthe strip, because the new right and left handed twists cancel the topology remains that of a right-handed\none-half-twist M\u00f6bius strip. As discussed in Section IV, in a random optical field a surprisingly large\nfraction of all M\u00f6bius strips have complicated structures similar to the one shown here.\n\nA standard, widely used characterization of curves in the plane is the Poincar\u00e9 index. This\nindex measures the winding number of the tangent to the curve, in our case the endpoint curve\nmeasured over one 2\u03c0 circuit of \u03c30 . Here we denote an analog of this index by d\u03c4 , and calculate it as d\u03c4 = arctan (dTZ /ds, dTX /ds) using the finite difference approximation d\u03c4 (\u03c7j ) =\narctan (TZ (\u03c7j+1 ) \u2212 TZ (\u03c7j ) , TX (\u03c7j+1 ) \u2212 TX (\u03c7j )) with uniform increment \u2206sj = sj+1 \u2212 sj =\n\u2206s > 0, where, Fig. 3a, s measures position on \u03c30 .\nAlthough the endpoint curves differ for axes \u03b1 and \u03b2, and although, like for \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , there is no\nobvious geometrical or topological necessity for d\u03c4 to be the same for both axes, we find, just like\nfor \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , that in \u03a30 (and again, only in \u03a30 ) in all cases d\u03c4\u03b1 = d\u03c4\u03b2 . Accordingly, in what follows\nwe label this index d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 .\nLike \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 takes on the values d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2. We show in Section IV that only ten\nof the sixteen possible combinations of \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 appear, so that these two indices are not\ncompletely independent one of the other. An example in which \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22121/2 and d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = +3/2 is\nshown in Fig. 10. As shown in this figure, we take the sign of the local rotation of the tangent\nvector to be + (\u2212) if the vector rotates locally in the counterclockwise (clockwise) direction.\nBut if d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 is even partially independent of \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , how can we be sure that d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 takes on only\nthe half integer values \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2? The answer consists of two parts: in the first part, given\nbelow, we show that over a single 2\u03c0 circuit of \u03c30 the vector tangent to the endpoint curve must\nrotate through n\u03c0, where n is an odd positive/negative integer. In the second part, which still\nremains to be accomplished, one shows that within the linear approximation |n| = 1, 3.\nOver a 4\u03c0 circuit of \u03c30 , when we return to our starting point the tangent vector to the endpoint\ncurve must also return to itself, so for a 4\u03c0 circuit the tangent vector rotates through 2n\u03c0. But\n\n\f15\nas illustrated in Fig. 10, the endpoint curve for the 4\u03c0 circuit has inversion symmetry, so that\nover any 2\u03c0 circuit the vector rotates through n\u03c0. The inversion symmetry of the endpoint curve\nreflects the fact that over a 4\u03c0 circuit we visit the axis of each ellipse on \u03c30 twice, arriving at\nopposite ends of the axis after a 2\u03c0 circuit. From this inversion symmetry it follows that after\nany 2\u03c0 circuit the tangent vectors at the beginning and end of the circuit must be antiparallel, so\nthat n must be an odd positive/negative integer.\n0\nZ\n\n0\n\u03c0\nX\n\n3\u03c0/2\n3\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n2\u03c0\n\n5\u03c0/2\n\nFIG. 10: Tangent index d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 . As in Figs. 8 and 9a, the central figure shows the curve (black dots)\ngenerated by the projection onto \u03c40 of the endpoints of axis \u03b1 of the ellipses on the surrounding circle \u03c30 .\nThe point where \u03c30 pierces \u03c40 is shown by the gray circle. The starting point of a 2\u03c0 circuit on \u03c30 is shown\nby the white dot, the end of the circuit by the black dot that terminates the endpoint curve. The tangent\nvector to the endpoint curve is shown by arrows labelled with the orientation of the vector relative to the\nstarting orientation, 0. As can be seen, the vector rotates through +3\u03c0 over the circuit, so that d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 ,\nwhich measures the net rotation of the vector, is d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = +3/2. The inset in the upper left corner shows\nthe endpoint curve for a 4\u03c0 circuit. As can be seen, this curve is centrosymmetric about \u03c30 . \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 can be\ndetermined by inspection using the phase ratchet rules. Here the sequence of crossings of the curve with the\nXZ-axes is Z\u2212 X\u2212 Z\u2212 Z+ ; after applying the rules this reduces to Z\u2212 X\u2212 , showing that \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22121/2.\n\n3.\n\nIndex d\u03c4\u03b3\n\nAs shown in Fig. 7, axis \u03b3 does not generate a M\u00f6bius strip. It may therefore appear surprising\nthat as \u03c40 rotates along \u03c30 the projections onto this plane of the \u03b3-axis endpoints generate a two\nturn helix. This helix, which can be either right- or left-handed, is characterized by tangential\nwinding number d\u03c4\u03b3 , the equivalent for axis \u03b3 of the index d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 for axes \u03b1 and \u03b2. As can be\nseen in Fig. 7, the endpoints of axis \u03b3 return to themselves after one 2\u03c0 circuit, so d\u03c4\u03b3 = \u00b1n;\nwe find in all cases |n| = 2, reflecting the fact that both turns of the helix are identical. Like a\nM\u00f6bius strip, a helix retains its handedness, and therefore its winding number, when viewed from\nany direction. Examples of d\u03c4\u03b3 are shown in Fig. 11, which also shows that the index \u03c4\u03b3 , the \u03b3\nequivalent of \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , is always zero, and is therefore of no interest.\nC.\n\nTopological Indices of the Projection onto \u03c00 : Indices \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , and d\u03c0\u03b3\n\nThe projections of the axes of the ellipses on \u03c30 onto the plane \u03c00 in Fig. 3b generate three\nwinding numbers that are analogs of \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , and d\u03c4\u03b3 .\n\n\f16\n\nZ\n\na\n\ns\n\nT\nX\n\nb\n\nc\n\nFIG. 11: Tangent index d\u03c4\u03b3 .

Starting at the white dot, the tangent vector to the curve (arrow) rotates monotonically in\nthe positive, counterclockwise direction through 4\u03c0, and d\u03c4\u03b3 = +2. (b) Here the endpoints form a righthanded helix, the tangent vector rotates through 4\u03c0 in the negative, clockwise direction, and d\u03c4\u03b3 = \u22122. (c)\nIndex \u03c4\u03b3 . Vector T oscillates back and forth with a net winding angle of zero. Starting at the white dot\nand proceeding clockwise, the crossing sequence of the endpoint curve with the XZ-axes is Z\u2212 Z+ Z\u2212 Z+ .\nApplying the rules of the phase ratchet yields an empty sequence, so \u03c4\u03b3 = 0; this is the value of \u03c4\u03b3 for all \u03b3\ncones. Unlike \u03b1 and \u03b2, whose endpoint curves are typically complex, Figs. 9 and 10, \u03b3 endpoint helices\nalways have smooth, simple shapes.\n\nThe \u03c00 analog of \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 we label \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 ; like \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 takes on the values \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2, is the same\nfor axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 in \u03a30 , and can be determined by inspection using the phase ratchet rules with\naxes XZ replaced by Y Z. All 16 combinations of \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 and \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 appear in our simulations, showing\nthat these two indices are independent one of the other.\nThe \u03c00 analog of d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 we label d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 ; like d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 takes on the values \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2, is the\nsame for axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 in \u03a30 , and can be determined by following the rotation of the tangent vector\nto the endpoint curve in \u03c00 . We show in Section IV that, just like for \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , only ten\nof the sixteen possible combinations of \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 appear, so that these two indices are not\ncompletely independent one of the other.\nThe \u03c00 analog of d\u03c4\u03b3 we label d\u03c0\u03b3 ; like d\u03c4\u03b3 , d\u03c0\u03b3 takes on the values \u00b12, and can be determined\nby following the rotation of the tangent vector to the \u03b3 endpoint curve. All 4 combinations of\nd\u03c4\u03b3 and d\u03c0\u03b3 appear in our simulations, showing that these two indices are independent one of the\nother.\n\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , and d\u03c0\u03b3 are illustrated in Fig. 12.\nD.\n\nLine Classification\n\nIn addition to determining winding numbers I\u03b1,\u03b2 for axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 (Section III.A.1), and I\u03b3 for\naxis \u03b3 (Section III.A.2), the projections of these axes onto \u03a30 determines another important property of ellipse fields: the line classification. In this classification, introduced by Berry and Hannay\n[18], one counts the number of straight streamlines that terminate (or equivalently originate) on a\nsingularity; here we denote this number by \u039b. We discuss this classification for C points for axes\n\u03b1 and \u03b2, and we then extend it to axis \u03b3.\n\n\f17\nZ\n\nY\nP\n\na\n\nb\n\ns\n\nFIG. 12: Indices \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , and d\u03c0\u03b3 . (a) \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 . \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 measures the net rotation of vector P.\nStarting at the small white circle, the crossing sequence of the endpoint curve (small black dots) with the\nY Z-axes is Y\u2212 Z\u2212 Z+ Z\u2212 , which, after application of the phase ratchet rules reduces to Y\u2212 Z\u2212 , showing that\n\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22121/2. d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 measures the net rotation of the tangent vector (small arrow) to the endpoint curve.\nThis vector is easily seen to rotate by 3\u03c0 in the negative, clockwise direction, and d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22123/2. (b) d\u03c0\u03b3 .\nd\u03c0\u03b3 measures the net rotation of the tangent vector (small arrow) to the \u03b3 helix, plotted here, as in Fig.\n11, vs. arclength s on \u03c30 . As can be seen, the tangent vector rotates in the negative, clockwise direction\nby 4\u03c0, and d\u03c0\u03b3 = \u22122. The data in (a) (in (b)) for \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 (for d\u03c0\u03b3 ) are for the same M\u00f6bius strip\n(same \u03b3 cone) as that shown in Fig. 10 (in Fig. 11a).\n1.\n\n\u039b\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nWe start be reviewing well known results about application of the line classification to C points.\nBerry and Hannay showed that within the linear approximation, for umbilic points there are only\ntwo possibilities \u039b = 1 and \u039b = 3 [18]. At an umbilic point the eigenvalues of the curvature tensor\n(matrix) become degenerate. This tensor can be represented by an ellipse, and at an umbilic\npoint the major and minor axes of the ellipse become equal and the ellipse degenerates to a circle.\nFrom this it easily follows that the results of Berry and Hannay are applicable to C points, which\nas discussed in Section II.A, are points where the eigenvalues of the coherency matrix become\ndegenerate and the polarization ellipse degenerates into a circle \u2212 the C circle.\nWhen the path that encircles the C point is a circle with sufficiently small radius, \u039b is the\nnumber of lines in plots such as those in Figs. 2, 4, and 6 that are radially directed towards the C\npoint. Labelling \u039b by the relevant axis we have from Berry and Hannay, \u039b\u03b1 = \u039b\u03b2 = \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 1, 3.\nThe reason why \u039b\u03b1 = \u039b\u03b2 for a C point is as follows: An important geometric property of\nthe lines in Figs. 2, 4, and 6, is that lines on opposite sides of \u03c30 are orthogonal. Thus, for\nevery line that points towards the C point there is a line on the opposite side of the circle that is\ntangent to \u03c30 . But as discussed in Section II.A.1, for \u03c30 sufficiently small the lines representing\nthe projections onto \u03a30 of axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 are also orthogonal, so that wherever \u03b1 is tangent to \u03c30 ,\n\u03b2 points towards the C point, and vice versa.\nHere we determine \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 numerically, finding the number of points on \u03c30 at which the orientation\n\u03b8 of the ellipse axis, measured counterclockwise relative to the x-axis, equals \u03c7, the angular position\nof the axis center on \u03c30 , Fig. 3. Specifically, calculating \u03b8 for say axis \u03b1 as \u03b8 = arctan (\u03b1y , \u03b1x ),\nwhere \u03b1x (\u03b1y ) are the components (projections) of \u03b1 along the x- and y-axes, respectively, we solve\n\u03b8 (\u03c7) = \u03c7 + n\u03c0, where n = \u22124 ... +4, as required [32, p. 258]. Fig. 13a illustrates a graphical\nimplementation of this method. We note that an alternative, analytical, method would be to use\nthe discriminant given by Dennis [33], writing the Stokes parameters in \u03a30 in terms of \u03b1x and \u03b1y\n[13], but the resulting expressions for the general case are so unwieldy as to be impractical.\nThere is an important connection between I\u03b1,\u03b2 and \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 . Because I\u03b1,\u03b2 = +1/2, \u22121/2 and\n\u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 1, 3, it might be thought that there are four possible combinations of these indices. Berry\n\n\f18\nand Hannay showed, however, that this is not the case and that the number of possible combinations\nis only three: (i ) I\u03b1,\u03b2 = +1/2, \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 1, the lemon; (ii ) I\u03b1,\u03b2 = +1/2, \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 3, the monstar ; and\n(iii ) I\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22121/2, \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 3, the star.

As discussed in the text, there are\nno |\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 | = 3/2 lemons.\n\nThere are also important connections between \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 , and \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , the phase ratchet rules, and\nthe endpoint curves in Figs. 8, 9, and 10; these connections follow from the facts that when the\nendpoint curve of say \u03b1 crosses the Z-axis of the plane \u03c40 , the projection of \u03b1 onto \u03a30 is tangent\nto \u03c30 , whereas when the endpoint curve crosses the Z-axis of \u03c00 , the projection of \u03b1 onto \u03a30 is\nradial (along the radius of \u03c30 ). These important geometrical results are illustrated in Fig. 14.\nWe therefore have the following:\n(i) Endpoint crossings with the Z-axis in \u03c40 and the Z-axis in \u03c00 occur at opposing points on\n\u03c30 (points separated by 180o ).\n(ii) \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 equals the number of endpoint crossings of the Z-axis in \u03c40 : at each crossing the axis\nprojection onto \u03a30 is tangent to \u03c30 , implying the presence of a radial projection at the opposing\npoint on \u03c30 ; by definition, \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 is the number of such radial projections.\n(iii) \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 also equals the number of endpoint crossings of the Z-axis in \u03c00 , because at each such\ncrossing the axis projection onto \u03a30 is radial.\n\n\f19\n\nZ\n\nZ\nX\n\nX\nY\n\nY\n\n\u03c00\n\n\u03c40\n\u03c30\n\n\u03c30\n\n\u03a30\n\n\u03a30\n\na\n\nb\n\nFIG. 14: Z-axis crossings. Ellipse axis centers (endpoints) are shown by small gray (white) circles, whereas\nthe axis itself is shown by the connecting thick line. The projected endpoint curves in the planes \u03c40 (the\nXZ-plane) and \u03c00 (the Y Z-plane) are shown by the connected black dots. (a) When the endpoint curve in\n\u03c40 crosses the Z-axis, the ellipse axis lies in the Y Z-plane, and its projection onto \u03a30 is tangent to the \u03c30\ncircle. (b) When the endpoint curve in \u03c00 crosses the Z-axis, the ellipse axis lies in the XZ-plane, and its\nprojection onto \u03a30 is radial.\n\nFrom (ii) and (iii) follows that the number of endpoint crossings with the Z-axis is the same\nfor both \u03c40 and \u03c00 , and that this number must be either 1 or 3. Below, for simplicity we refer to\nan endpoint crossing with the Z-axis as a \"crossing\", and we have the following:\n(I ) If \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 1, |\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 | = 1/2: from the phase ratchet rules if |\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 | = 3/2 there must be more\nthan one crossing. Thus, all lemons are M\u00f6bius strips with a single half-twist. The converse,\nhowever, is not true, and a one-half-twist strip can have \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 3, and can therefore be a star or\na monstar, Figs 13c,d\n(II ) If |\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 | = 3/2, then \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 3, so all M\u00f6bius strips with three half-twists are either stars\nor monstars. This important result is to be credited to Dr. Mark R. Dennis (Bristol), who, using\nthe methods of differential geometry, was first to derive it [34].\n(III ) Within the linear approximation the M\u00f6bius strips surrounding C lines can have one or\nthree half-twists \u2212 strips with say five half-twists cannot occur within this approximation. Strips\nnot necessarily associated with C lines, or with L lines (which have four half-twists), are also\npossible; an example is the two-half-twist (one-full-twist) M\u00f6bius strips that surround ordinary\nellipses [14, 15].\n2.\n\n\u039b\u03b3\n\nFor the line classification for axis \u03b3 we find the following: If I\u03b3 = +1, \u039b\u03b3 = 0, 4, whereas if\nI\u03b3 = \u22121, \u039b\u03b3 = 4; examples of all three cases are shown in Fig. 6, where, as in Fig. 13 for \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 ,\naxes that point toward the C point are marked by thick lines. Unlike the case of axes \u03b1 and\n\u03b2, however, at opposing points on \u03c30 , \u03b3 axes are not perpendicular, but are parallel. Whether\n\u039b\u03b3 = 0, or \u039b\u03b3 = 4, depends on whether the endpoint curve in \u03c00 crosses the Z-axis, because the\ngeometrical considerations shown in Fig. 14b hold for all three axes \u2212 \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. In Fig. 15\nwe show the three endpoint curves that correspond to the three cases in Fig. 6. As can be seen,\nwhen \u039b\u03b3 = 0 ( \u039b\u03b3 = 4) the endpoint curve crosses the Z-axis 0 (4) times.\n\n\f20\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\ns\n\na\n\nb\n\nY\n\ns\n\ns\n\nY\n\nc\n\nY\n\nFIG. 15: Axis \u03b3 endpoint curves in \u03c00 . Panels (a), (b), and (c), are the endpoint curves corresponding to\npanels (a), (b), and (c) in Fig. 6, respectively. As can be seen, here in (a) the endpoint curve does not\ncross the Z-axis and in (a) of Fig. 6 \u039b\u03b3 = 0 , as expected. In (b) and (c) there are four crossings and in\n(b) and (c) of Fig. 6 \u039b\u03b3 = 4, again as expected.\nE.\n\nIndex Summary\n\nWe summarize here the rather complex results discussed above for the various indices. All\nindices are the same for axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 and are therefore labelled \"\u03b1, \u03b2\".\n(i ) Index I\u03b1,\u03b2 measures the rotation of the projections of axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 onto \u03a30 , the plane of\nthe C circle, Fig. 2. Generically I\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b11/2. A positive (negative) value for this index, and\nfor index I\u03b3 below, implies that the axis projections rotate in the same (opposite or retrograde)\ndirection as the path on which they are measured.\n(ii ) There are either one or three points on a sufficiently small circular path centered on the C\npoint at which the axis projections point directly towards the point. The number of such points\nis measured by the line classification index \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 . Unlike I\u03b1,\u03b2 , \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 is not a topological invariant,\nbut is nonetheless an important, highly useful characterization.\n(iii ) If I\u03b1,\u03b2 = +1/2 and \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 1 (\u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 3), the C point is dubbed a \"lemon\" (a \"monstar\"),\nFig. 13. Lemons always correspond to M\u00f6bius strips with a single half-twist, whereas monstars\ncan be M\u00f6bius strips with one or three half-twists. If I\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22121/2, then \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 3, and the C\npoint is dubbed a \"star\". Stars can correspond to M\u00f6bius strips with one or three half-twists.\nConversely, if a M\u00f6bius strip has a single half-twist without any mutually cancelling additional\ntwists (Fig. 9b) it must be a lemon, whereas if it has three half-twists it can be either a star or a\nmonstar. The above relationships are the same for both right- and left-handed M\u00f6bius strips.\n(iv ) Index I\u03b3 measures the rotation of the projection of axis \u03b3 onto \u03a30 ; generically I\u03b3 = \u00b11,\nFig. 6. The line classification index \u039b\u03b3 measures the number of points on the path at which \u03b3\naxis projections point directly towards the C point. If I\u03b3 = +1, \u039b\u03b3 = 0, 4, whereas for I\u03b3 = \u22121,\n\u039b\u03b3 = 4. I\u03b1,\u03b2 and I\u03b3 are independent, and all four combinations of these indices can appear. I\u03b3\nand \u039b\u03b3 are independent of the number of twists or handedness of the M\u00f6bius strip.\n(v ) The magnitude of index \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 measures the net number of half twists of the M\u00f6bius strip,\nthe sign of \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 measures the handedness of the strip (+ = left-handed, \u2212 = right-handed), Figs.\n8 and 9. There are four possible values for \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 : \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = +1/2, \u22121/2, +3/2, \u22123/2.\n(vi ) There are in principle 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 4 = 16 possible triple combinations of I\u03b1,\u03b2 , \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 , and \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , but\n(see (iii ) above) only 10 are allowed: I\u03b1,\u03b2 = +1/2, \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 1, |\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 | = 1/2 (a one-half-twist lemon);\nI\u03b1,\u03b2 = +1/2, \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 3, |\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 | = 1/2, 3/2 (a one- and a three-half-twist monstar); I\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22121/2,\n\u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 3, |\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 | = 1/2, 3/2 (a one- and a three-half-twist star).\n(vii ) \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 is independent of I\u03b3 and \u039b\u03b3 , and for each of the three allowed I\u03b3 and \u039b\u03b3 combinations\nin (iv ) above, all four values of \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 appear, so that in total there are 12 triple combinations of I\u03b3 ,\n\n\f21\n\u039b\u03b3 , and \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 .\n(viii ) Whereas \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 measures the net signed number of times axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 rotate or loop\naround the line of the path, index d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 measures additional signed rotations or loops that do not\nencircle this line, Fig. 10. d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 takes on the four values d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2. A right-handed\none-half-twist M\u00f6bius strip (\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22121/2), for example, can have d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = +3/2 due to additional\nloops that are \"up in the air\", as it were.\n(ix ) Indices \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 measure oscillations of axes \u03b1 and \u03b2 that form signed loops not\ncaptured by indices \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 : \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2; d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2, Fig. 12. \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 is\nindependent of \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 is independent of d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 .\n(x ) Indices d\u03c4\u03b3 and d\u03c0\u03b3 measure \"up in the air\" oscillations of axis \u03b3 that form signed loops\nwhich do not enclose the line of the path, Fig. 11. These indices describe the cones generated by\naxis \u03b3, Fig. 7, are independent of one another, and of the corresponding \u03b1, \u03b2 indices, and take the\nvalues: d\u03c4\u03b3 = \u00b12; d\u03c0\u03b3 = \u00b12.\nAltogether there are a total of ten indices that characterize C points, their M\u00f6bius strips, and\ntheir cones: I\u03b1,\u03b2 , I\u03b3 , \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 , \u039b\u03b3 , \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c4\u03b3 , d\u03c0\u03b3 . If independent, these indices could\ngenerate 24 \u00d7 44 \u00d7 22 = 16384 different C points (C lines). The connections discussed above reduce\nthis number to 7680. In Section IV we discuss additional connections that reduce this number\neven further, and present statistical data for the various index combinations.\nIV.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nHere we list the most important statistical properties of the geometrically and topologically\ndistinct Mobius strips that appear in \u03a30 . We emphasize that these statistics change importantly\nwhen the plane of observation \u03a3 is rotated away from \u03a30 by small, but finite angles.\nAs noted in Section III.E, the ten indices I\u03b1,\u03b2 , I\u03b3 , \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 , \u039b\u03b3 , \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , d\u03c4\u03b3 , d\u03c0\u03b3 , if\nindependent, could generate 16384 different C points (C lines). This number is reduced to 7680\nby the constraints discussed in Section III.D. In this section we search for additional constraints\n(selection rules) that further reduce the number of allowed index combinations, and we present\nstatistical data for the probabilities of the remaining combinations.\nWe search a database containing 106 independent, randomly generated realization, after removing all realizations in which any one of the ten indices differed by more than \u00b10.001 from an integer\nor half integer. This eliminated \u223c 2% of the realizations. The the remaining index combinations,\nwhich all obey the constraints discussed in Section III.D, have a very broad distribution. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 16 using a modified Zipf plot. As can be seen from this plot, it is unlikely that\nthe number of configurations appearing in an arbitrarily large database would substantially exceed\n1, 200.\nA.\n\nSelection Rules\n\nIt is useful to formulate constraints among indices in the form of selection rules \u2212 rules that\nstate which combinations of indices are forbidden. Here we list 13 such rules: 8 rules involve pairs\nof indices \u2212 binary rules; 5 rules involve index triplets \u2212 ternary rules.\nThe search for binary (ternary) rules is facilitated by 2D (3D) plots such as those shown in Fig.\n17. There are, in principal, a total of 45 2D plots and 120 3D plots that need to be examined\nand interpreted. Our algorithms, however, display for analysis only those plots in which there are\nmissing indices, reducing the number of plots to 8 for 2D, and 62 for 3D. Of the 3D plots, 57 do\nnot yield new ternary rules, because the absence of configurations results from combinations of the\nbinary rules. An example of this is shown in Fig. 17c.\n\n\f22\n4.5\n4\n3.5\n\n2.5\n\n(N\n\nRank\n\n)\n\n3\n\nlog\n\n10\n\n2\n1.5\n\nI\u03b1,\u03b2 I\u03b3 \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 \u039b \u03b3 \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 d\u03c4 \u03b3 d\u03c0\u03b3\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n-1/2\n-1/2\n-1/2\n-1/2\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n0 -3/2 -3/2 -3/2 -3/2 -2 -2\n0 -3/2 -3/2 3/2 3/2 -2 2\n0 3/2 3/2 -3/2 -3/2 2 -2\n0 3/2 3/2 3/2 3/2 2 2\n\n-0.5\n\n1\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\nRank\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n1200\n\nFIG. 16: Modified Zipf plot. The logarithm of the number of exemplars, NRank , found for a given tenindex configuration is plotted vs. the rank of the configuration, where configurations are ranked in order\nof decreasing probability. The straight line is NRank = No exp (\u2212K \u00d7 Rank), with No = 4950 and\nK = 0.00575. The tabular inset lists the four most probable configurations (the four unresolved points in\nthe upper left corner). There are some 2 \u00d7 104 exemplars of each of these four configurations in the complete\n106 entry database. As can be seen, these four most probable configurations are all three-half-twist stars.\n\nAltogether, the 13 selection rules reduce the number of index configurations from 16, 384 to\n2, 104. This is almost twice the number observed, Fig. 16, indicating the possible presence of\nadditional, higher-order rules. There is no simple way to systematically search for such rules,\nhowever, since in the overwhelming majority of cases the absence of index configurations for, say\nthe 210 quaternary combinations, will be due to binary and ternary selection rules acting together.\nBecause of this we have not attempted higher-order searches.\n\n1.5\n\nd\u03c0 \u03b3\n\n\u03c0 \u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n-0.5\n\nx\n\n-2\n1.5 x\n0.5\n\n-1.5\n\n0.5\n-1.5\n\n-0.5\n\n\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\nb\n\n-1.5 -1\n\nI\u03b3\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\nd\u03c0\n\u03b1,\u03b2 -0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 -0.5\n\nc\n\n-1.5\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\nx\n\n-0.5\n-1.5\n1.5\n\na\n\nx\nx\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nd\u03c4\n\n2x\n\n1.5\n\n-1.5\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx1.5\n\n0.5\n-0.5 \u03c0\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nFIG. 17: Index combinations.

These rules,\nhowever, are practical rules, since any configuration not seen in 106 samples in unlikely to appear\nin an experiment. The fact that the rules reduce the number of configurations only to 2104, which\nis nearly twice the number actually observed, Fig. 16, may imply the existence of additional rules\nor may be due to other, presently unknown, factors.\nB.\n\nProbabilities\n\nListed below are the probabilities of occurrence of various configurations in our database. We\nemphasize that these are not densities, and therefore do not directly correspond to the quantities\nthat would be measured in an experiment. In order to compute densities each realization needs\nto be weighted by a Jacobian (with units of area\u22121 ) that, like the realization itself, is a function\nof the wave field parameters in Eq. (3).\nAt present there are two Jacobians available [9]. Defining J = \u2207 (Re (E * E))\u00d7\u2207 (Im (E * E))\nthese are\nJ2D = |J z | ,\n\nJ3D = |J| .\n\n(7a)\n(7b)\n\n\f24\nIn Eq. (7a) the z-axis is normal to the plane of observation, here \u03a3. J2D is suitable for counting\n2D densities in the plane, such as the density of C points that appear where C lines pierce the\nplane. J3D measures 3D quantities, such as the length of C line/unit volume. But neither of\nthese two Jacobians, at least as written, depends sensitively on the angle between the \u03a3 and \u03a30 .\nThis sensitivity is essential, because as emphasized above, the statistics change importantly when\n\u03a3 rotates away from \u03a30 by a small, but finite angle.\nThe probabilities listed below, although not directly connected to experiment, are, in principle,\ncalculable from theory. We note that eliminating the Jacobian from the theory, in fact, greatly\nsimplifies the calculation.\nAmong the endless probabilities P that can be extracted from our database we believe the\nfollowing to be of greatest interest:\n(1) Positive and\nnegative values\nfor \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 and \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2\nprobability P ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001 occur with equal\n\u0001\n1\n3\n3\n1\nand P \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b1 2 = P \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b1 2 = 0.80, P \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b1 2 = P \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b1 2 = 0.20. Throughout, we use the notation \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b1 12 , \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b1 12 , instead of |\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 | = |\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 | = 1/2, etc., to emphasize\nthat in searching our database we search for each sign combination separately. When in later\ntables the results are sign dependent we list each sign combination.\n(2) The frequency of occurrence of Mobius strips with one and three half-twists that are lemons,\nmonstars, and stars, are listed in Table 1. The selection rules forbid lemons with \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 and \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2\nequal to \u00b1 23 .\nTable 1.

Examining the full 3D arrangement of the surrounding ellipses we found\nthat their major and minor axes, \u03b1 and \u03b2, generate M\u00f6bius strips, whereas the normals to these\nellipses, \u03b3, generate a section of a cone. The M\u00f6bius strips have either one or three half-twists,\nand form segments of either right-handed or left-handed screws.\nThe \u03a30 projections of \u03b1 and \u03b2 give rise to two well-known indices [1, 3]: the conserved topological index I\u03b1,\u03b2 , and the highly useful, albeit nontopological, line characterization \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 . These,\nand all other indices in \u03a30 , have the same values for axes \u03b1 and \u03b2, whence the subscript \u03b1, \u03b2.\nI\u03b1,\u03b2 measures the rotation of the projections of \u03b1, \u03b2 around the C point, and takes on the generic\nvalues I\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u00b11/2. On a circular path centered on the C point, here labelled \u03c30 , \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 counts\nthe number of times an axis projection points directly at the C point. Generically, \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 1, 3,\nand there are three possible combinations of I\u03b1,\u03b2 and \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 : the lemon (I\u03b1,\u03b2 = 1/2, \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 1); the\nmonstar (I\u03b1,\u03b2 = 1/2, \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 3); and the star (I\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22121/2, \u039b\u03b1,\u03b2 = 3).\nWe introduced 8 new indices.\nTwo of these involve the projections of axis \u03b3 onto \u03a30 . As is the case for axes \u03b1 and \u03b2, for\naxis \u03b3 this projection gives rise to a conserved topological index, I\u03b3 , and a line characterization,\n\u039b\u03b3 . Generically I\u03b3 = \u00b11, and \u039b\u03b3 = 0, 4, and also here there are only three possible combinations:\nI\u03b3 = 1, \u039b\u03b3 = 0, 4; I\u03b3 = \u22121, \u039b\u03b3 = 4.\nSix new indices arise from two new projections: the \u03c40 projection and the \u03c00 projection.\nThe major and minor axes of the surrounding ellipses generate two winding numbers for each\nprojection: \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 for the \u03c40 projection, \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 for the \u03c00 projection. Each of these\nfour indices can take on four different values: \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2. \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 measures the number of half-twists\nof the M\u00f6bius strip, the other three indices measure other, more subtle structural features. \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2\nand \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 are independent, and all 16 combinations of these indices are found. \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 , and\nalso \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 , are not completely independent, and only 10 of the 16 possible combinations\nof each index pair are allowed.\n\n\f26\nThe \u03c40 and \u03c00 projections of axis \u03b3 generate the last two of our 8 new indices. These are d\u03c4\u03b3\nand d\u03c0\u03b3 , each of which can be \u00b12.\nA set of simple rules, the phase ratchet rules, were formulated that permit \u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 and \u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 to be\ndetermined by inspection from the \u03c40 and \u03c00 projections; d\u03c4\u03b1,\u03b2 and d\u03c0\u03b1,\u03b2 can also be determined\nby inspection from these projections.\nOf the 16, 384 combinations of indices that would be possible in the absence of all restrictions,\nsome 1, 150 were observed in a database containing 106 randomly generated realizations. This\nnumber of distinct C lines exceeds by a factor of \u223c 350 the three types of lines (lemon, monstar,\nstar) recognized previously. Thirteen selection rules were formulated that reduce the number\nof possibilities to 2, 104. These rules include the well-known restriction that gives rise to the\nlemon-monstar-star trio, together with 12 new rules; the most important of these new rules are: all\nlemons are one-half-twist Mobius strips, and [34], all three-half-twist M\u00f6bius strips are either stars\nor monstars. The converse of the lemon rule, however, does not hold, and one-half-twist M\u00f6bius\nstrips can also be monstars or stars.\nStatistics of the most important configurations were also presented. Most notable of these is\nthat 80% of all M\u00f6bius strips have a single half-twist, the remaining 20% three half-twists. Also\nnoteworthy is the fact that although all three-half-twist strips are monstars or stars, the majority\nof monstars and stars are, in fact, one-half-twist M\u00f6bius strips.\nA recurrent theme was the complexity of the various M\u00f6bius strips; this complexity was illustrated by numerous examples, and described geometrically. Because of this complexity, a more\ncomplete mathematical description of these objects, which includes the dependence of the various\nindices, and their selection rules, on the parameters of the optical field, may be rather complicated.\nRecent advances make experimental measurements of the M\u00f6bius strips and cones feasible in\nboth the microwave and optical regions of the spectrum. Such experiments would do much to\nfurther our knowledge of the structure of real, as opposed to simulated, 3D optical fields.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI am pleased to acknowledge extensive discussion with, and many helpful comments and suggestions by, Prof. David A.
