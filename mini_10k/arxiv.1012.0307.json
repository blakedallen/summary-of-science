INTRODUCTION\n\nObservations by the H.E.S.S. collaboration of TeV\ngamma-ray emission from the blazar PKS 2155-304\nreveal very rapid variability (Aharonian et al. 2007;\nHESS Collaboration et al. 2010), at very high flux levels. In the most extreme flare, variations on a timescale\nof a few hundred seconds at a flux level corresponding to an isotropic luminosity of 1046 erg/s were measured. If, as expected, the mass M of the central\nblack hole is 2 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 , these observations imply\nstructure in the jet that is roughly one hundred times\nsmaller than the gravitational radius rg = GM/c2\n(Begelman et al. 2008). Though this is the most extreme\nexample, several other blazars exhibit very rapid variability in GeV and TeV gamma-rays (e.g., Albert et al.\n2007; Ackermann et al. 2010), which it is proving difficult to accommodate in the standard synchrotronself-Compton picture, mainly because of the very high\nLorentz factor and low magnetisation required of the\njet (Levinson 2007; Boutelier et al. 2008; Graff et al.\n2008; Katarzy\u0144ski et al. 2008; Kusunose & Takahara\n2008; Mastichiadis & Moraitis 2008; Neronov et al. 2008;\nGhisellini et al. 2009; Giannios et al. 2009; Paggi et al.\n2009; Tammi & Duffy 2009; Rieger & Volpe 2010;\nNalewajko et al. 2010).\nIn the framework of ideal MHD, radial (uncollimated)\nrelativistic jets do not accelerate after they pass through\nthe fast magnetosonic point. Collimation, however, requires special boundary conditions (Lyubarsky 2009,\njohn.kirk@mpi-hd.mpg.de, iwona.mochol@mpi-hd.mpg.de\n\n2010). It is, therefore, difficult to envisage the production\nof a jet with high Lorentz factor and low magnetisation.\nAn isolated, impulsive, ejection event in an ideal MHD\nflow is able to circumvent this problem (Granot et al.\n2010), but, in a fluctuating jet, dispersion filters out\nthe small timescale structure, and limits the acceleration\n(Levinson 2010a). It appears, therefore, that it may be\nnecessary to go beyond the ideal MHD approximation in\norder to understand the observations of very rapid variability in blazars.\nNon-ideal MHD effects can become important when\nplasma is charge-starved: If the number density of\ncharged particles is limited, this places a maximum on\nthe absolute value of the charge density, which can,\nfor example, result in the inability of the plasma to\nscreen out the component of the electric field parallel\nto the magnetic field. Charge starvation also places\nan upper limit on the available current density. As\nthis limit is approached, the relative drift-speed of the\ncharged components becomes relativistic, and their associated inertia begins to contribute to the fluid stressenergy tensor. This situation might plausibly arise\nin a black-hole magnetosphere, because axisymmetric,\ngeneral-relativistic, MHD simulations of jets launched\nby accreting, rotating black holes (De Villiers & Hawley\n2003; McKinney & Gammie 2004) reveal a conical region around the rotation axis into which the accreting\nplasma does not penetrate. As in a pulsar magnetosphere, the matter density in this region is likely to be\ndetermined not by accretion, but by the rate at which\nelectron-positron pairs are created in the strong elec-\n\n\f2\ntromagnetic fields that penetrate it (Goldreich & Julian\n1969; Blandford & Znajek 1977; Levinson 2000). If an\noutflow results, the density of pairs decreases, and, far\nfrom the hole, non-MHD effects connected with particle\ninertia can become important.\nIn the case of an axisymmetric, force-free magnetosphere, it is known that plasma is ejected, carrying off energy mainly in the form of Poynting flux via\nthe \"Blandford-Znajek\" mechanism. On the axis itself,\nthe energy flux vanishes, so that the polar regions of\nthe jet do not dominate the overall energetics. However, observations of rapid variability suggest that axisymmetry may not be a good approximation, since\nthey imply small-scale structure in the black-hole magnetosphere. Simulations in which the black-hole spin\nand the asymptotic magnetic field are misaligned find\na Poynting flux comparable to the Blandford-Znajek\nvalue (Palenzuela et al. 2010), making it plausible that\nalso more complex non-axisymmetric field structures can\npower a substantial, magnetically dominated, polar jet.\nIn the following, we develop this idea by examining the\npropagation characteristics of nonlinear electromagnetic\nwaves above the polar regions of a rotating black hole.\nUsing a model consisting of cold electron and positron\nfluids, we show that a circularly polarised magnetic shear\npropagates radially outwards at roughly the fast magnetosonic speed until it reaches the point where the ideal\nMHD description loses its validity. In (non-ideal) MHD\nlanguage, this happens when the inertia of the plasma\nparticles begins to affect the conductivity, i.e., when the\ndrift speeds implied by the plasma current become relativistic (Melatos & Melrose 1996; Meier 2004). This can\noccur at a large distance from the black hole, depending on the density of injected pairs. The wave then goes\nthrough a phase of delayed acceleration in which it converts Poynting flux into kinetic energy flux. If particles\nradiate gamma-rays in the acceleration zone, then, despite the large spatial extent of the source, the spatiotemporal structure of the shear wave, that is imprinted\non it close to the black hole, modulates the radiation,\nprovided the mass-loading of the jet is sufficiently small.\nIn section 2 we discuss the parameters used to specify the physical conditions in the jet. The two-fluid jet\nmodel is presented in section 3. First, the nonlinear\nplane-wave solution representing a magnetic shear is derived, then radial propagation in spherical geometry is\ndiscussed. It is shown in the Appendix that general relativistic effects drop out in the short-wavelength approximation (c/\u03c9 \u226a r) when the Kerr metric is used. The\napplication to blazar variability is discussed in section 4,\nand our conclusions summarised in 5.\n2. JET PARAMETERS\n\nConsider a radial outflow consisting of an electronpositron plasma emerging from the polar regions of the\nmagnetosphere of a rotating black hole, and denote by\nL and \u1e40 the total luminosity and mass-flux carried in\na solid opening angle \u03a9s . The physical conditions in the\nflow can be specified via three dimensionless parameters:\n1. The nonlinearity or strength parameter a is a dimensionless measure of the energy-flux density.\nFor a circularly polarized vacuum electromagnetic\nwave of frequency \u03c9/2\u03c0 and electric field E, the\n\nstrength parameter is conventionally defined as\na = eE/(mc\u03c9), and measures the Lorentz factor\nthat an electron would achieve if it were acceler\u22121\nated from rest over a distance of (2\u03c0) times one\nwavelength in the field E. Assuming radial propagation, the corresponding luminosity is\nm 2 c 3 \u03c9 2 a 2 \u03a9s r 2\n,\n(1)\n4\u03c0e2\nand we use this expression to define a for a general\n(non-vacuum) wave. In the absence of radiation\nlosses, a \u221d r\u22121 , and is determined by specifying\nits value at some fiducial radius. For this we chose\nr0 = c/\u03c9, although our treatment is, of course,\nvalid only for r \u226b r0 and we certainly do not expect\nradial flow to extend to such small radii. With this\nchoice, a0 is independent of \u03c9:\nL=\n\na = a0 (r0 /r)\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\n4\u03c0e2 L\na0 =\nm 2 c 5 \u03a9s\n\n(2)\n\n1/2\n\n= 3.4 \u00d7 1014 L46 ,\n\n(3)\n\u0001\nwhere L46 = (4\u03c0/\u03a9s ) L/ 10 erg/s is the\n\"isotropic\" or \"4\u03c0\" luminosity of the jet, scaled\nappropriately. The energy radiated per unit solid\nangle by a jet is directly measurable if the distance\nto the object is known. For the rapidly variable\ngamma-ray flare of PKS 2155-304, it corresponds\nto an isotropic luminosity of roughly 1046 erg/s, so\nthat, for this object, L46 & 1.\n46\n\n2. The mass-loading of the wind is conventionally described by the \u03bc-parameter introduced by Michel\n(1969):\n\u03bc = L/\u1e40c2 .\n\n(4)\n\nIn the case of an electron-positron jet, \u03bc denotes\nthe Lorentz factor each particle would have if the\nentire luminosity was carried by a cold, unmagnetised flow. It is constant in those parts of the jet\nin which pair creation and radiation losses can be\nneglected.\n3. The magnetisation parameter \u03c3 describes the ratio of the energy flux carried by electromagnetic\nfields to that carried by particles. For monoenergetic electrons and positrons of Lorentz factor \u03b3,\n\u03c3 = (\u03bc/\u03b3) \u2212 1 .\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b30 = \u03bc/ (\u03c30 + 1) .\n\n(6)\n\nIn a cold, non-accelerating, ideal MHD flow, \u03c3\nis constant (assuming pair creation and radiation\nlosses are negligible). However, as we show below,\n\u03c3 is not constant in charge-starved jets, even in the\nabsence of dissipation. For this reason, we specify\nits value at the \"launching\" radius, inside of which\nthe ideal MHD approximation is assumed to hold,\nand denote this quantity by \u03c30 , even though the\nregion of constant \u03c3 is unlikely to extend to radii\nas small as r \u223c c/\u03c9. The particle Lorentz factor at\nthe launching point is then\n\n\fCharge-starved blazar jets\nThe mass-loading parameter \u03bc is determined by the\nphysics of the pair-production cascade close to the black\nhole. A more intuitive measure, therefore, is the pair\nmultiplicity \u03ba, which relates the pair (proper) number density n\u00b1 to the number density of electrons (or\npositrons) needed to screen out the (magnetic-)fieldaligned component of the rotation-induced electric field.\nAdopting the definition conventionally used in pulsar\nphysics, but replacing the angular velocity of the neutron star by c/rg gives (e.g., Lyubarsky & Kirk 2001)\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nB\n,\n(7)\n\u03ba = \u03b3\u00b1 n \u00b1\n2\u03c0erg\nwhere \u03b3\u00b1 is the Lorentz factor of the fluids. In the inner\nregions of the flows we consider, where \u03c3 = \u03c30 \u226b 1,\nthe fluids move non-relativistically in the wave frame, so\nthat \u03ba \u2248 a/ (4\u03bc). Thus, in the absence of radiation losses\nand pair production, \u03ba \u221d r\u22121 in this region. Physically,\nit is the value of \u03ba at the outer boundary of the pairproduction region that is most relevant. This is thought\nto be close to the black hole, but its precise location is\nunknown. In the following, therefore, we specify \u03ba by its\nvalue \u03barg at r = rg :\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc\na0\n.\n(8)\n\u03barg \u2248\n4\u03bc \u03c9rg\n3. THE TWO-FLUID MODEL\n\nThe simplest model of an electron-positron plasma\nthat captures the physics connected with the finite inertia of the charge-carriers is that of two cold, oppositely charged fluids (denoted by suffices \u2212 and +).\nWe adopt this model, embed it in a Kerr metric, following Khanna (1998) and Koide (2009), and look for\nlarge-amplitude waves propagating in the radial direction in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. To keep the analysis tractable, only transverse waves with vanishing phaseaveraged components of the electric and magnetic fields\nare treated. In this case, since \u2207 * E = 0, the number\ndensity is the same for each fluid. We further assume\nthe wave carries no radial current, so that the radial\nfluid velocities also equal each other: vr\u0302+ = vr\u0302\u2212 = vr\u0302 ,\nand restrict the treatment to waves in which the meridional and azimuthal fluid velocities are equal in magnitude but of opposite sign: v\u03b8\u0302+ = \u2212v\u03b8\u0302\u2212 , v\u03c6\u0302+ = \u2212v\u03c6\u0302\u2212 .\nIt follows that the fluids\nfactor:\n\u0011\n\u0010 have the same Lorentz\n1/2\n\n2\n2\n\u03b3+ = \u03b3\u2212 = \u03b3 = c/ c2 \u2212 vr\u03022 \u2212 v\u03b8\u0302+\n\u2212 v\u03c6\u0302+\n, and the\nsame radial component of the four-velocity, which we\nwrite as a dimensionless momentum: pk = vr\u0302 \u03b3/c. Circularly polarised waves are likely to be the most important in the polar regions of a rotating black hole, and\nthese are best treated by introducing complex quantities\nto describe the\n\u0011 mo\u0010 of the fluid\n\u0010 transverse\u0011components\nmenta: p\u22a5 = v\u03b8\u0302+ + iv\u03c6\u0302+ \u03b3/c (= \u2212 v\u03b8\u0302\u2212 + iv\u03c6\u0302\u2212 \u03b3/c)\nand the electric and magnetic fields: E = E\u03b8\u0302 + iE\u03c6\u0302 ,\nB = B\u03b8\u0302 + iB\u03c6\u0302 .

Here, we\nconcentrate on subluminal waves, for which the condition\n\u2206 = 0 holds. Physically, this means that the particles are\nin resonance with the wave, i.e., the radial components of\nthe fluid velocities equal the phase velocity of the wave.\nIn this case (9) shows that the phase dependence of the\ndensity is arbitrary, (12) is trivially satisfied, and (11)\nrequires that the transverse components of the fluid velocities are parallel to the magnetic field: Im (p\u22a5 B \u2217 ) = 0.\nThus, the plasma current is directed along the magnetic\nfield and, to this order, the forces exerted on the fluids by\nthe fields vanish. Finally, the current and magnetic field\nare linked by Ampere's equation, which, to this order,\nreads\n\u2202B 8\u03c0inecp\u22a5 \u03b2w\n=\n.\n2)\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u03c9 (1 \u2212 \u03b2w\n\n(13)\n\nCombined with (11) this implies that the magnitude of\nthe magnetic field is phase-independent. Viewed from a\nframe that moves radially with speed \u03b2w , the electric field\nvanishes, and the wave is simply a static magnetic field\nof constant magnitude whose direction rotates through\n2\u03c0 radians over one wavelength. At each point, the current and, hence p\u22a5 , is parallel to the magnetic field to\nzeroth order. The rate at which the B-vector rotates is\narbitrary, being determined by the dependence of the\nfluid density n on phase. In the following, we select\n2\n2\nthe simplest case, where n, |B| and |p\u22a5 | are all constant and the wave is a monochromatic magnetic shear:\nB \u221d p\u22a5 \u221d e\u00b1i\u03c6 .\n3.2. Radial evolution of a magnetic shear\nThe slow evolution of the subluminal magnetic shear\nwave as it propagates outwards at r \u226b rg is governed by\nthe first-order equations in the expansion in \u01eb \u223c c/ (\u03c9r),\nas derived in Appendix A.

Note that in a non-monochromatic wave,\nthe quantities pk , \u03c9\u0302, \u03c3 and \u03b3 are replaced in these equations by their phase-averages.\nAccording to (13), \u03c3, as defined in (A32) is related to\nthe fluid momentum components through\n\u03c3=\n\n4 4\n\u03b2w\n\u03b3w |p\u22a5 |\n\u03c9\u0302 2 pk 2\n\n2\n\n,\n\nFinally, at large radius, R \u226b \u03bc, only kinetic energy remains: \u03b3 \u2248 \u03b3w \u2248 \u03bc, |p\u22a5 | \u226a 1.

It is straightforward to reduce these to a\nfirst-order ordinary differential equation for p\u22a5 (\u03b3w ), for\nexample. Solutions extend from R = 0 to R = \u221e provided they are launched at super-magnetosonic speed:\n\u03c3 = (\u03bc/\u03b3) \u2212 1 < \u03bc2/3 .

At small R, |p\u22a5 | \u226a 1 and the wave is essentially\n\nThe locations of the three phases of wave propagation\nillustrated in Fig. 1 depend on the parameters a0 , \u03bc (or\n\u03barg ), \u03c30 and \u03c9. As discussed in Sect. 2, it is possible\nto infer values for a0 and \u03c9 directly from the observed\nflux and variability timescale. Another parameter may\nbe eliminated by fixing the wave speed at its launching\npoint. A very slow, sub-magnetosonic outflow can be\ndescribed by the force-free MHD equations, and would\naccelerate as \u03b3 \u221d r (Buckley 1977), until it approached\n1/2\nthe sonic speed, where \u03b30 \u2248 \u03c30 \u2248 \u03bc1/3 . On the other\nhand, all waves launched at super-magnetosonic speeds\n(\u03c30 < \u03bc2/3 ) behave similarly, as described in Sect. 3.2,\nwith the acceleration phase moving out to larger radius\nas the initial magnetisation decreases. It suffices, therefore, to analyse the case of mildly supersonic launch:\n\u03c30 \u2248 \u03bc2/3 , corresponding to the maximum magnetisation of a supersonic flow.\nHowever, the uncertainty associated with the unknown\nmass-loading of the flow can be removed only by modelling the pair cascade.

(24)\nrg M 9\nThe solutions presented in section 3.2 eventually convert all of the Poynting flux to kinetic energy flux at\nlarge radius. However, in the case of blazars, this is unlikely to be realised, since the resulting Lorentz factor\n(= \u03bc) is very large. Instead, dissipative processes so far\nneglected, such as instabilities in the wave-solution, or\n\n\fCharge-starved blazar jets\ninteraction of the jet with the external medium, or with\nambient photons, are likely to intervene.\nThe wave propagates radially with fixed frequency.\nHowever, if it converts part of its energy into highfrequency (\u226b \u03c9), forwardly beamed photons via an emissivity that is modulated by the wave-phase, then the difference between photon and wave propagation speeds will\nlead to a smoothing of the modulation in the observed\nphoton signal. This loss of short-timescale variability\nbecomes more effective as the size of the radiating section of the wave increases. Similarly, if the photons do\nnot propagate exactly in the radial direction, smoothing\nof the modulation will be produced by the difference in\nlight-travel time to the observer from different parts of\nthe spherical wavefront. It is straightforward to derive a\ncriterion on the size of the emitting region (assumed \u223c r)\nand the Lorentz factor of the jet, such that fluctuations\nof frequency \u03c9 are not suppressed in the photon signal\n(Michel 1971; Arons 1979; Kirk et al. 2002):\n2\n\u03b3w\n2\u03c0c/\u03c9 > r .\n\n(25)\n\nIn the acceleration region, \u03b3w \u221d r, so that this condition is fulfilled everywhere within this region, provided it\nis satisfied at the beginning, where r = racc , and \u03b3w = \u03b30 .\nCombining (22) and (23) the requirement that modulation on a timescale of 100\u2206t100 seconds should not be\nfiltered out leads to an upper limit on the multiplicity:\n1/8\n\n\u03barg < 14 \u2206t100 L46 M9\u22121 .\n\n(26)\n\nEquation (26) implies that electron-positron pair creation is much less effective in the central engine of a\nrapidly variable blazar than it is in a pulsar magnetosphere (e.g., Medin & Lai 2010), but this is perhaps not\nunexpected, given that a neutron star surface is able to\nanchor a very strong magnetic field. However, it also\nimplies that blazars exhibiting extreme variability contain a charge-starved magnetosphere able to support a\nvacuum gap (Levinson 2000, 2010b). This scenario is\nparticularly attractive, because the non-stationary nature of gap discharges found in pulsar-related studies\n(Levinson et al. 2005; Timokhin 2010), suggests a natural source of short-timescale (< rg /c) variability in the\noutflow from a black-hole magnetosphere.\n5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n5\n\nIn this paper, we describe a mechanism that causes a\nmagnetically dominated, radial outflow from a black-hole\nmagnetosphere to enter a delayed acceleration phase,\nstarting at a distance from the hole given by (22). Applying this mechanism to blazar jets, we derive a constraint, (26), on the pair density in the magnetosphere\nthat would allow radiation produced where the jet accelerates to retain any short-timescale structure imposed\non it close to the launching site.\nThe mechanism is based on an analysis of the propagation characteristics of a nonlinear wave \u2013 specifically a circularly polarised magnetic shear \u2013 in a lowdensity plasma. Such a wave, we suggest, is likely to\nbe launched in the polar regions of a rotating, accreting black hole, and, in a non-axisymmetric picture, may\nfluctuate on a time shorter than rg /c, as indicated by observations of the source PKS 2155-304. Acceleration is a\nresult of charge-starvation \u2013 a non-MHD effect that arises\nwhen the relative drift-speed of the oppositely charged\nconstituents in a low-density plasma becomes relativistic. The analysis employs a cold two-fluid model of the\nplasma, and uses a short-wavelength perturbation expansion to find the evolution of the radially propagating,\nnonlinear wave. The equations are derived in Kerr geometry. However, under the conditions we envisage, where\nthe wavelength of the oscillation is of the same order\nin the expansion parameter as the gravitational radius,\ngeneral relativistic effects do not appear in the governing\nequations.\nSeveral important problems remain to be investigated.\nThese include the nature of the dissipation and radiation mechanisms, and the effect these might have on the\npropagation of the wave, as well as the possibility of\nmodelling the multi-wavelength blazar spectrum. Furthermore, although the picture of a circularly polarised\nmagnetic shear that is static in the jet frame is intuitively\nattractive, this is only one specific, nonlinear solution of\nthe governing equations; other polarisations and other\nmodes, such as the linearly polarised \"striped wind\"\n(Lyubarsky & Kirk 2001) or the electromagnetic mode\nof superluminal phase-speed (Kirk 2010) may also prove\nimportant. Nevertheless, the underlying physical cause\nof the acceleration - the inertia of the charge-carriers -\nsuggests that delayed jet-acceleration may be a generic\nphenomenon.\n\nAPPENDIX\nEQUATIONS OF WAVE PROPAGATION IN KERR GEOMETRY\n\nHere we derive the equations governing the radial propagation of transverse, circularly polarised, electromagnetic\nwaves in a plasma consisting of cold electron and positron fluids that are embedded in a Kerr metric. We use a\nshort-wavelength approximation: c/\u03c9r \u223c \u01eb \u226a 1, where \u03c9 is the wave frequency, and assume the gravitational radius\nis of the same order in \u01eb as the wavelength.
