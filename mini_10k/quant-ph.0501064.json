In particular, some problems whose known classical solutions require exponential-time algorithms can\nnow, in principle, be solved in polynomial time, if use is made of these quantum resources [1, 2, 3]. Unfortunately,\nthe implementation of such an efficient algorithm encounters an almost unsurmountable obstacle: the degrading and\nubiquitous decoherence due to the unavoidable coupling with the environment [4, 5]. However, if the agent coupling the\nquantum computer to its environment is degenerate, any quantum information processed within the corresponding\ndegenerate subspace does not decohere [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The recent experimental verification and\ninvestigation of decoherence-free subspaces (DFS) [15, 16] have continuously increased their potential application in\nquantum information processing [17, 18, 19, 20]. In practice, these DFS's are only approximate, because all observables\nof a quantum system are ultimately coupling agents to the surroundings, some of these being incompatible with a\nparticular degenerate one that gives rise to a DFS. In this sense, any proposal intended to further protect such an\napproximate DFS is relevant to the effort to make quantum computing a realistic endeavor.\nIn any physical implementation of a quantum computer, the basic unit of information processed is the qubit, as\nthe bit is the elementary information processed by a classical computer. Whatever the representation of a qubit in a\nquantum computer, it should be operated through unitary transformations, including the identity. Since the subspace\nspanned by a qubit is two dimensional, the manipulation of a qubit must be represented by SU(2) transformations.\nThe information processed by a quantum computer is, therefore, represented by states of a tensor product of twodimensional qubit subspaces. Universal quantum computation requires a set of quantum gates represented by unitary\ntransformations of two qubits at least [12, 21, 22].\nAn N -dimensional decoherence-free subspace, HN , is possible only when the agent coupling it to its surroundings\nis an observable degenerate on HN [9]. If one considers the implementation of a minimal set of universal quantum\ngates operating on two qubits only, then there is no nontrivial degenerate observable available to establish a fourdimensional decoherence-free subspace. Without loss of generality, in a system of four qubits (e.g., four 1/2 spins), the\nnontrivial choice of Jz as the coupling observable allows us to construct two distinct four-dimensional decoherence-free\nsubspaces associated with the eigenvalues of Jz equal to Mz = \u00b1~. Here we consider the four-dimensional subspace\nwith Mz = +~, within which we assume that gate operations are described by the usual spin-boson Hamiltonian:\nH0 (t) = \u2212\n\n4\n4\n~ X h (n) i\u2020 (n) ~2 X h (m) i\u2020 (mn)\nB (t) \u03a3 +\n\u03a3\nG\n(t) \u03a3(n)\n2 n=1\n4 n,m=1\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere\n\u03a3(n)\n\n\uf8f9\n(n)\n\u03c3x\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n= \uf8f0 \u03c3 y(n) \uf8fb\n(n)\n\u03c3z\n\uf8ee\n\n(n)\n\n\uf8f9\n(n)\nBx (t)\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\nB(n) (t) = \uf8f0 By(n) (t) \uf8fb\n(n)\nBz (t)\n\uf8ee\n\nand\n\n\uf8f9\n(mn)\n(mn)\n(mn)\nGxx (t) Gxy (t) Gxz (t)\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n(mn)\n(mn)\nG(mn) (t) = \uf8f0 G(mn)\n(t) \uf8fb .\nyx (t) Gyy (t) Gyz\n(mn)\n(mn)\n(mn)\nGzx (t) Gzy (t) Gzz (t)\n\uf8ee\n\nThe operators \u03c3 j with j = x, y, z correspond to Pauli matrices for spin n, obeying the well-known su(2) commutation\nrelations. Furthermore, the real (3 \u00d7 1)-matrix B(n) (t) is associated with an external field acting locally on qubit n,\nand the real (3 \u00d7 3)-matrix G(mn) (t) represents externally-controlled interactions between qubits m and n.\nDecoherence is universal for real systems [23]. Essentially all the observables of a system are coupled to the\nenvironment, rendering decoherence unavoidable. However, it has been proposed that continuous measurement of\nan observable protects (through the quantum Zeno effect) states defined in the subspace associated to a degenerate\neigenvalue of that observable [14]. In the present work we show, using the simple system above as a paradigm, that\na strong enough coupling of Jz to the environment effectively creates H4 . In other words, provided the initial states\nare chosen within Mz = +~ and H0 (t) commutes with Jz , we show that the environment effects induced by couplings\nto system observables incompatible with Jz are immaterial if the frequency of measurement of Jz is high enough.\nThis work is organized as follows. Section II describes the construction of a universal set of quantum gates operating\nwithin a DFS. In Section III we introduce a perturbation that degrades the original DFS and establish a scheme to\ninhibit the perturbing effects through continuous measurement. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section IV.\nII.\n\nQUANTUM-GATE CONSTRUCTION IN A DECOHERENCE-FREE SUBSPACE\n\nUniversal quantum computation can be achieved by using any single member of the infinite class of universal sets of\nquantum gates. Any gate capable of entangling two qubits, together with a minimal set of one-qubit gates form such\na universal set [12, 21, 22]. For our purposes, we choose the traditional set composed by the two-qubit controlled-not\n(CNOT) gate, the Hadamard gate, and the \u03c0/8 gate [24].\nTo obtain the effective Hamiltonians for the mentioned universal set of quantum gates, we start from imposing that\nthe general spin-boson Hamiltonian H0 (t) commute with Jz . After some algebra we obtain\n4\n4\n3\n~ X (n)\n~2 X X h (mn)\n(n)\n(mn)\n(m) (n)\n(m) (n)\nG\n(t) \u03c3 (m)\nBz (t) \u03c3 (n)\n+\nz \u03c3 z + Gxx (t)(\u03c3 x \u03c3 x + \u03c3 y \u03c3 y )\nz\n2 n=1\n4 n=1 m=n+1 zz\ni\n(m) (n)\n(m) (n)\n+ G(mn)\nxy (t)(\u03c3 x \u03c3 y \u2212 \u03c3 y \u03c3 x )\n\nH0 (t) = \u2212\n\n(n)\n\n(mn)\n\n(mn)\n\n(2)\n\n(mn)\n\nwhere the independent coefficients Bz (t), Gzz (t), Gxx (t), and Gxy (t) are arbitrary real functions of time to\nensure that H0 (t) be Hermitian. Below we show, by explicit construction, that the restriction of this Hamiltonian to\nthe four-dimensional subspace spanned by the eigenstates of Jz with eigenvalue Mz = +~, H4 , is sufficiently general\nto form all the possible four-by-four Hermitian matrices. In this way, we equivalently prove that universal quantum\ncomputation is possible within the decoherence-free subspace (DFS), H4 , of our four-qubit model, since the set of all\nHermitian matrices produces the set of all unitary matrices through the exponential operation.\nIt is straightforward to show that the following choices of independent parameters form a complete set of Hermitian\nmatrices within H4 :\nHCNOT =\n\n\u03c0~ (3)\n(1) (2)\n(1) (2)\n(\u03c3 z + \u03c3 (4)\nz \u2212 \u03c3x \u03c3x \u2212 \u03c3y \u03c3y )\n4\u03c4\n\n(3)\n\nHT1 = \u2212\n\n\u03c0~ (3)\n(\u03c3 z + \u03c3 (4)\nz )\n8\u03c4\n\n(4)\n\nHT2 = \u2212\n\n\u03c0~ (2)\n(\u03c3 z + \u03c3 (4)\nz )\n8\u03c4\n\n(5)\n\nfor the controlled-not gate,\n\nfor the \u03c0/8 gate for the first qubit,\n\nfor the \u03c0/8 gate for the second qubit,\nHH1 =\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c0~ h\n(4)\n(2)\n2)(\u03c3 (3)\n(2 \u2212 2)(\u03c3 (1)\nz + \u03c3z )\nz + \u03c3 z ) + (2 +\n8\u03c4\ni\n\u221a\n(3)\n(1) (3)\n(2) (4)\n(2) (4)\n\u2212 2 (\u03c3 (1)\nx \u03c3x + \u03c3y \u03c3y + \u03c3x \u03c3x + \u03c3y \u03c3y )\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\nfor the Hadamard gate for the first qubit, and\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c0~ h\n(3)\n(4)\n2)(\u03c3 (2)\nHH2 =\n(2 \u2212 2)(\u03c3 (1)\nz + \u03c3 z ) + (2 +\nz + \u03c3z )\n8\u03c4\ni\n\u221a\n(2)\n(1) (2)\n(3) (4)\n(3) (4)\n\u2212 2 (\u03c3 (1)\nx \u03c3x + \u03c3y \u03c3y + \u03c3x \u03c3x + \u03c3y \u03c3y )\n\n(7)\n\nfor the Hadamard gate for the second qubit, where \u03c4 is a positive and real constant with dimension of time. We\nnote that HT2 and HH2 are related with HT1 and HH1 through the interchange of the superscripts 2 and 3. These\nHamiltonians are just one possible set chosen, since the abundance of independent parameters renders the associated\nlinear system indeterminate. For this particular set of independent Hamiltonians to work according to conventional\ntwo-qubit quantum computation, we define two abstract qubits spanning H4 according to the mapping:\n|0, 0i\n|0, 1i\n|1, 0i\n|1, 1i\n\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\n| \u2191, \u2191, \u2191, \u2193i\n| \u2191, \u2191, \u2193, \u2191i\n| \u2191, \u2193, \u2191, \u2191i\n| \u2193, \u2191, \u2191, \u2191i.\n\nNow, by multiplying each of the above time-independent Hamiltonians by \u2212i\u03c4 /~ and exponentiating, we obtain, in\nmatrix format with respect to the ordered subspace basis (| \u2191, \u2191, \u2191, \u2193i, | \u2191, \u2191, \u2193, \u2191i, | \u2191, \u2193, \u2191, \u2191i, | \u2193, \u2191, \u2191, \u2191i):\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n1 0 0 0\n\uf8ef0 1 0 0\uf8fa\n(8)\nUCNOT = exp(\u2212i\u03c4 HCNOT /~) = \uf8f0\n0 0 0 1\uf8fb\n0 0 1 0\nfor the controlled-not operation,\n\nUT1\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8fa\n1\n0 \u0001\n0\n\uf8fa\ni\u03c0\n0 \u0001\uf8fb\n0 exp 4\n0\n0\nexp i\u03c0\n4\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n0\n0\n\uf8fa\n0\n0\n\uf8fa\n1\n0 \u0001\uf8fb\n0 exp i\u03c0\n4\n\n1\n\uf8ef0\n= exp(\u2212i\u03c4 HT1 /~) = \uf8ef\n\uf8f00\n0\n\nfor the \u03c0/8 operation on the first abstract qubit,\n\nUT2\n\n1\n0 \u0001\n\uf8ef 0 exp i\u03c0\n4\n= exp(\u2212i\u03c4 HT2 /~) = \uf8ef\n\uf8f00\n0\n0\n0\n\nfor the \u03c0/8 operation on the second abstract qubit,\n\nUH1\n\n1\n1 \uf8ef0\n= exp(\u2212i\u03c4 HH1 /~) = \u221a \uf8f0\n2 1\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n1\n1 \uf8ef1\n= exp(\u2212i\u03c4 HH2 /~) = \u221a \uf8f0\n2 0\n0\n\n1\n\u22121\n0\n0\n\n\uf8ee\n\n1\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\nfor the Hadamard operation on the first abstract qubit, and\n\nUH2\n\n\uf8ee\n\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n\uf8f9\n0\n1 \uf8fa\n0 \uf8fb\n\u22121\n\uf8f9\n0\n0 \uf8fa\n1 \uf8fb\n\u22121\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nfor the Hadamard operation on the second abstract qubit. As mentioned above, these unitary transformations form\na possible set of operations suitable for universal computing.\nInspecting the right-hand sides of Eqs. (3)-(7), we notice that the construction of the above model of universal\ncomputation, within a decoherence-free subspace, does not require interactions represented by the tensor product of\n(mn)\ntwo spin-1/2 operators of different directions. We believe that being able to choose all the Gxy (t) equal to zero, and\nyet obtain universal computing, might be relevant in the context of realistic implementation. In this section we have\nestablished, therefore, one of the simplest protections against decoherence for a complete set of quantum-computation\ngates. In the next section we investigate how robust this protection can be, by introducing an additional perturbing\nterm to the Hamiltonian of a general quantum computation being processed within the DFS.\n\n\f4\nIII.\n\nMEASUREMENT-INDUCED INHIBITION OF DECOHERENCE WITHIN A PERTURBED\nDECOHERENCE-FREE SUBSPACE\n\nA two-qubit quantum computation can be described as a sequence of quantum-gate operations on an input density\nmatrix \u03c1(0) = |\u03c6(0)ih\u03c6(0)|, where |\u03c6(0)i is the ket specifying the initial state of the two abstract qubits. If the input\nstate belongs to H4 , then any computation involving the two abstract qubits can be performed by a sequence of the\nuniversal operations described by (3) to (7), or, in a condensed form, by (2), where the time-dependent coefficients\nvary as functions of time according to the specific computation, reproducing the required gate sequence.\nWe model the coupling with the environment by the product of Jz and observables of infinitely many harmonic\noscillators representing the environment. By construction, the system Hamiltonian, at all times, satisfies [H0 (t), Jz ] =\n0, since the computation is designed to occur entirely in H4 . Now, it is obvious that any perturbation added to H0 ,\neven if it acts only on the system, that couples H4 to its complement in the original four-qubit Hilbert space, triggers\nthe process of decoherence. Therefore, to simulate the possibility of this degradation of the computation, it suffices\nto study the dynamics of the following Hamiltonian:\nX\nH(t) = H0 (t) + HE + \u03bbJz\ngk (ak + a\u2020k ) + \u01ebJx\n(13)\nk\n\nwhere gk is a coupling constant to the kth environmental degree of freedom, \u03bb and \u01eb are positive real constants\nsatisfying \u03bb \u226b \u01eb, and the environment Hamiltonian is given by\nX\nHE =\n~\u03c9k a\u2020k ak\n(14)\nk\n\nwhere ak and a\u2020k are the annihilation and creation operators, respectively,\nof frequency \u03c9k , representing one of the environmental degrees of freedom.\n\nof the kth quantum harmonic oscillator,\nWe remark that here the meaning of the\n\nterm \"environment\" also possibly includes a measuring apparatus.\nNext we show that, as \u03bb increases as compared to \u01eb, the degradation of the computation dynamics due to decoherence\ndecreases substantially, reaching a regime in which it can be safely neglected. Our interpretation of this fact parallels\nthe ideas of [14]: \"the strong coupling to the environment functions as a continuous measurement of whether the\nperturbation takes the system state out of H4 , protecting the dynamics against the perturbation.\" We are, therefore,\nbenefiting from the quantum Zeno effect to induce the inhibition of the decoherence process.\nFor convenience, let us define the unitary time-evolution operator\n!#\n\"\nX\nit\n\u2020\nHE + \u03bbJz\ngk (ak + ak )\n.\n(15)\nU(t) \u2261 exp \u2212\n~\nk\n\nUsing the results of [25] and J\u00b1 = Jx \u00b1 iJy , we deduce that\n2\n\nwhere\n\n2\n\nU\u2020 (t) Jx U(t) = e\u03b3(t)Jz e\u2212i\u03b1(t)Jz Jx ei\u03b1(t)Jz e\u2212\u03b3(t)Jz\n\u0011\nei\u03b1(t) \u0010 [\u03b3(t)\u22122i\u03b1(t)Jz ]\n=\ne\nJ+ + e\u2212[\u03b3(t)\u22122i\u03b1(t)Jz ] J\u2212\n2\n\u03b1(t) =\n\nX \u0012 \u03bbgk \u00132\nk\n\n\u03c9k\n\n[(\u03c9k t) \u2212 sin(\u03c9k t)]\n\n\u03b3(t) =\n\nX\nk\n\n(16)\n\n[fk (t)a\u2020k \u2212 fk\u2217 (t)ak ]\n\nwith\nfk (t) = \u2212\n\n\u03bbgk\n[1 \u2212 ei(\u03c9k t) ] .\n\u03c9k\n\nFurthermore, let us denote by U0 (t) the unitary operator that satisfies the evolution equation\ni~\n\ndU0 (t)\n= H0 (t)U0 (t)\ndt\n\nwith U0 (0) = 1, where 1 is the identity operator on H4 . Because H0 (t) commutes with Jz , it follows that U0 (t)\ncommutes with U(t), and the Hamiltonian for the qubits and its environment in the interaction picture is written as\nh\ni\nH(t) = \u01eb U\u20200 (t) U\u2020 (t) Jx U(t) U0 (t) .\n(17)\n\n\f5\n\n1.0\n\nFidelity\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n1.00\n\n0.7\n\n0.99\n\n0.6\n0.98\n\n0.5\n0.97\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nt\n\nFIG. 1: Fidelity as a function of dimensionless time \u01ebt for different values of \u039b. For this particular illustration, we take\n\u03bdc = 105 and consider the following values of \u039b: 2000 (solid line), 1150 (dashed line), and 800 (dotted line). In this figure, the\ngate-operation time is \u03c4 , \u01eb being such that \u01eb\u03c4 = 1. The inset shows the details of the fidelity as a function of \u01ebt, where we can\nsee that this function never exceeds one preserving the established superior limit, as it should.\n\nThe fidelity of the computing process is given by [24]\nF(t) = TrE [h\u03c6(0)|\u03c1I (t)|\u03c6(0)i]\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the trace is taken over the environmental degrees of freedom and \u03c1I (t) is the density matrix of the qubits and\nits environment in the interaction picture, i.e., \u03c1I (t) = |\u03a8I (t)ih\u03a8I (t)|, with |\u03a8I (t)i satisfying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nd|\u03a8I (t)i\n= H(t)|\u03a8I (t)i .\n(19)\ndt\nEquation (19) can be solved iteratively in the usual approach of perturbation theory and it is easy to show that the\nfirst-order term does not contribute to the fidelity. To obtain the second-order contribution, we need to calculate the\nquantity h\u03c6(0)|H(t1 )H(t2 )|\u03a8I (0)i. Of course, the qubits are initially prepared in a pure state and |\u03a8I (0)i is initially\nfactored so that |\u03a8I (0)i = |\u03c6(0)i \u2297 |Ei, where |Ei is the initial state of the environment. Hence, to evaluate the\nsecond-order perturbation contribution to the fidelity we need to calculate the quantity h\u03a6(t1 )|\u03a6(t2 )i, where\ni~\n\n|\u03a6(t)i = H(t)|\u03c6(0)i .\nNow, let us define the auxiliary quantities |\u03c7\u00b1 (t)i \u2261 U\u20200 (t) J\u00b1 U0 (t)|\u03c6(0)i. Because |\u03c6(0)i belongs to H4 , it follows\nthat Jz |\u03c7\u2212 (t)i = 0 and Jz |\u03c7+ (t)i = 2|\u03c7+ (t)i. Therefore, it is easy to check that\nh\u03a6(t1 )|\u03a6(t2 )i = \u0393++ (t1 , t2 ) e\u2212\u03b3(t1 ) e\u03b3(t2 ) + \u0393+\u2212 (t1 , t2 ) e\u2212\u03b3(t1 ) e\u2212\u03b3(t2 )\n+ \u0393\u2212+ (t1 , t2 ) e\u03b3(t1 ) e\u03b3(t2 ) + \u0393\u2212\u2212 (t1 , t2 ) e\u03b3(t1 ) e\u2212\u03b3(t2 )\n\nwhere we define the c-number functions as\n1 3i[\u03b1(t1 )\u2212\u03b1(t2 )]\ne\nh\u03c7+ (t1 )|\u03c7+ (t2 )i\n4\n1 i[3\u03b1(t1 )+\u03b1(t2 )]\n\u0393+\u2212 (t1 , t2 ) =\ne\nh\u03c7+ (t1 )|\u03c7\u2212 (t2 )i\n4\n1 \u2212i[\u03b1(t1 )+3\u03b1(t2 )]\ne\nh\u03c7\u2212 (t1 )|\u03c7+ (t2 )i\n\u0393\u2212+ (t1 , t2 ) =\n4\n1 \u2212i[\u03b1(t1 )\u2212\u03b1(t2 )]\n\u0393\u2212\u2212 (t1 , t2 ) =\ne\nh\u03c7\u2212 (t1 )|\u03c7\u2212 (t2 )i .\n4\n\u0393++ (t1 , t2 ) =\n\n(20)\n\n\f6\nTo calculate the contribution of order \u01eb2 to the fidelity, the trace over the environmental degrees of freedom requires\nthe evaluation of expectation values like hE|e\u2212\u03b3(t1 ) e\u03b3(t2 ) |Ei. For this purpose, we first observe that \u03b3(t) has a\nmathematical structure analogous to the argument of the displacement operator D(zk ) = exp(zk a\u2020k \u2212 zk\u2217 ak ) for a\nparticular k-oscillator belonging to the environment. The second step consists in the expansion of |Ei in a convenient\nbasis which permits us to include a wide class of environmental states (e.g., a Fock basis expansion with arbitrary\ncoefficients). Thus, the expectation values can be promptly calculated and their final result are proportional to\nexp(\u2212\u03bb2 F), where F is a real function of t1 and t2 [26]. It is important to mention that contributions of higher order\nthan \u01eb2 present the same factor in the calculations of expectation values and consequently similar analysis can be\napplied, implying that the fidelity tends toward unity as \u03bb increases.\nTo ilustrate these calculations, for computational convenience, we have assumed a continuum-mode approximation\nwith a non-ohmic spectral density R(\u03c9) = (\u03c9 2 /2\u03c9c3 )e\u2212\u03c9/\u03c9c , cutting off exponentially as \u03c9 gets greater than the cut-off\nfrequency \u03c9c . Furthermore, for the sake of simplicity,\nwe also take a constant coupling gk = 1 for all k, and a nontrivial\n\u221a\ninitial superposition state given by |\u03c6(0)i = (1/ 2)(|1, 0i \u2212 |0, 0i) in the abstract basis. The fidelity (18) for this case\nis shown in figure 1, where we define the dimensionless parameters \u039b = \u03bb/\u01eb and \u03bdc = \u03c9c /\u01eb. We confirm that, in this\nsimple ilustrative example, as \u039b increases the fidelity function oscillates tending to unity and this fact corroborates\nour general model.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nNowadays, the implementation of quantum gates within decoherence-free subspaces is one of the fundamental\nstrategies in the development of a realistic quantum-computer technology. The current experimental investigations\nhave only considered existing DFS's, without attempting to protect the quantum-information processing [15, 16, 17,\n18, 19, 20]. Intending to improve this scenario, our present proposal advances the idea of inhibiting the degradation\nof the gate operation within the DFS by continuous measurement. Although we have illustrated this idea through\na simplistic model, within a perturbation-theory context, we strongly believe that our results are not particular. A\nnon-perturbative generalization of the present approach, independent of the model used to describe the environment\nand its coupling to the system, is currently under our scrutiny.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been supported by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP), Brazil,\nprojects \u266f 01/11562-2 (PEMFM), \u266f 01/11209-0 (MAM) and \u266f 00/15084-5 (RJN).
