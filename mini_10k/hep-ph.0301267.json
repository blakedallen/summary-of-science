Colangelo and F. De Fazio\nIstituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Bari, Italy\n\nAbstract\nWe use light-cone QCD sum rules to evaluate the strong coupling gf0 K + K \u2212\nwhich enters in several analyses concerning the scalar f0 (980) meson. The\nresult: 6.2 \u2264 gf0 K + K \u2212 \u2264 7.8 GeV is larger than in previous determinations.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLight scalar mesons are the subject of an intense and continuous scrutiny aimed at clarifying several aspects of their nature that still need to be unambiguously established [1, 2].\nFrom the experimental point of view, these particles are difficult to resolve because of the\nstrong overlap with the continuum background. On the other hand, the identification is\nmade problematic since both quark-antiquark (q q\u0304) and non q q\u0304 scalar states are expected\nto exist in the energy regime below 2 GeV. For example, lattice QCD and QCD sum\nrule analyses indicate that the lowest lying glueball is a 0++ state with mass in the range\n1.5-1.7 GeV [3]. Actually, the observed light scalar states are too numerous to be accomodated in a single q q\u0304 multiplet, and therefore it has been suggested that some of them\nescape the quark model interpretation. In addition to glueballs, other interpretations\ninclude multiquark states and admixtures of quarks and gluons.\nParticularly debated is the nature of the meson f0 (980). Among the oldest suggestions,\nthere is the proposal that quark confinement could be explained through the existence\nof a state with vacuum quantum numbers and mass close to the proton mass [4]. On\nthe other hand, following the quark model and considering the strong coupling to kaons,\nf0 (980) could be interpreted as an ss state [5, 6, 7, 8]. However, this does not explain\n\u221a\nthe mass degeneracy between f0 (980) and a0 (980) interpreted as a (uu \u2212 dd)/ 2 state. A\nfour quark qqqq state interpretation has also been proposed [9]. In this case, f0 (980) could\neither be nucleon-like [10], i.e. a bound state of quarks with symbolic quark structure\n\u221a\n\u221a\nf0 = ss(uu + dd)/ 2, the a0 (980) being a0 = ss(uu \u2212 dd)/ 2, or deuteron-like, i.e. a\n\nbound state of hadrons. If f0 is a bound state of hadrons, it is usually referred to as a KK\nmolecule [11, 12, 13, 14]. In the former of these two possibilities the mesons are treated\nas point-like, while in the latter they should be considered as extended objects.\n\nThe identification of the f0 and of the other lightest scalar mesons with the Higgs nonet\nof a hidden U(3) symmetry has also been suggested [15]. Finally, a different interpretation\nconsists in considering f0 (980) as the result of a process in which strong interaction enE\nriches a pure q\u0304q state with other components, such as K K\u0304 , a process known as hadronic\n\ndressing [6, 16]; such an interpretation is supported in [2, 5, 6, 8, 17, 18, 19]. In ref. [20]\nit has been shown that the experimentally observed lightest scalar particles in the I=1\nand I=1/2 sectors can be reproduced in this way, starting from a bare q q\u0304 and sq\u0304 structure\n\nrespectively (q being a light non strange quark). On the other hand, I=0 states are the\nmost elusive ones, since there are two possible bare structures, q q\u0304 and ss\u0304, which could\nnot only undergo hadronic dressing, but also mix through hadronic loops. The resulting\n2\n\n\fpicture strongly depends on the couplings of the bare structures to the hadronic channels.\nSeveral experimental analyses aimed at discriminating among the different possibilities. In particular, the radiative \u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3 decay mode has been identified as an effective\ntool for such a purpose [10, 12, 21]. As a matter of fact, if f0 has a pure strangeness\ncomponent f0 = ss\u0304, the dominant \u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3 decay mechanism is the direct transition,\n\nwhile in the four-quark scenario \u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3 is expected to proceed through kaon loops with\na branching fraction depending on the specific bound state structure [12, 21].\n\nAn important hadronic parameter entering in several analyses involving f0 (980) is the\nstrong coupling gf0 K + K \u2212 . Indeed, the kaon loop diagrams contributing to \u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3 are\n\nexpressed in terms of gf0 K + K \u2212 , as well as in terms of the coupling g\u03c6K +K \u2212 which can\nbe inferred from experimental data on \u03c6 meson decays. The coupling gf0 K + K \u2212 can be\nobtained from various processes, and we shall present an overview of the determinations\nin the last part of this paper. It is interesting to carry out a calculation in a framework\nbased on QCD, trying to point out what is a distinctive feature of the scalar particles,\ni.e. their large couplings to the hadronic states.\nThe present study is devoted to a determination of gf0 K + K \u2212 by light-cone QCD sum\nrules, a method applied to the calculation of several hadronic parameters both in the\nlight, both in the heavy quark sector [22, 23]. The analysis and the numerical results are\npresented in Section 2, while a summary of the experimental data and of other theoretical\ndeterminations is given in Section 3.\n\n2\n\nCoupling gf0 K + K \u2212 by light-cone QCD sum rules\n\nIn order to evaluate the strong coupling gf0 K + K \u2212 , defined by the matrix element:\nhK + (q)K \u2212 (p)|f0 (p + q)i = gf0 K + K \u2212 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwe consider the correlation function\nT\u03bc (p, q) = i\n\nZ\n\nd4 x eip*x hK + (q)|T [J\u03bcK (x)Jf0 (0)]|0i .\n\n(2)\n\nThe quark currents J\u03bcK and Jf0 represent the axial-vector J\u03bcK = \u016b\u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 s and the scalar\nJf0 = s\u0304s current, respectively, while the external kaon state has four momentum q, with\nq 2 = MK2 . The choice of the Jf0 = s\u0304s current does not imply that f0 (980) has a pure s\u0304s\nstructure, but it simply amounts to assume that Jf0 has a non-vanishing matrix element\nbetween the vacuum and f0 [19, 24]. Such a matrix element, as mentioned below, has\nbeen derived by the same sum rule method.\n3\n\n\fExploiting Lorentz invariance, T\u03bc can be written in terms of two independent invariant\nfunctions, T1 and T2 :\nT\u03bc (p, q) = i T1 (p2 , (p + q)2 ) p\u03bc + T2 (p2 , (p + q)2 ) q\u03bc .\n\n(3)\n\nThe analysis of the correlation function in eq.(2), following the general strategy of QCD\nsum rules, allows us to obtain a quantitative estimate of gf0 K + K \u2212 . The method consists\nin representing T\u03bc in terms of the contributions of hadrons (one-particle states and the\ncontinuum) having non-vanishing matrix elements with the vacuum and the currents\nJ\u03bcK and Jf0 , and matching such a representation with a QCD expression computed in a\nsuitable region of the external momenta p and p + q [25].\nLet us consider, in particular, the invariant function T1 in eq.(3) that can be represented by a dispersive formula in the two variables p2 and (p + q)2 :\n2\n\n2\n\nT1 (p , (p + q) ) =\n\nZ\n\ndsds\u2032\n\n\u03c1had (s, s\u2032 )\n.\n(s \u2212 p2 )[s\u2032 \u2212 (p + q)2 ]\n\n(4)\n\nThe hadronic spectral density \u03c1had gets contribution from the single-particle states K and\nf0 , for which we define current-particle matrix elements:\nhf0 (980)(p + q)|Jf0 |0i = Mf0 f \u0303\nh0|J\u03bcK |K(p)i = ifK p\u03bc ,\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nas well as from higher resonances and a continuum of states that we assume to contribute\nin a domain D of the s, s\u2032 plane, starting from two thresholds s0 and s\u20320 . Therefore,\nneglecting the f0 width, the spectral function \u03c1had can be modeled as:\n\u03c1had (s, s\u2032 ) = fK Mf0 f \u0303gf0 K + K \u2212 \u03b4(s \u2212 MK2 )\u03b4(s\u2032 \u2212 Mf20 ) + \u03c1cont (s, s\u2032)\u03b8(s \u2212 s0 )\u03b8(s\u2032 \u2212 s\u20320 ) , (7)\nwhere \u03c1cont includes the contribution of the higher resonances and of the hadronic continuum.

The function \u03c63K is twist three, while the distribution ampli-\n\ntudes in (14) and (15) are twist four. The functions \u03c8\u0302 and \u03c6\u0302 appearing in eq.(9) are defined\nR\nR\nin terms of \u03c6\u22a5 , \u03c6k , \u03c6\u0303\u22a5 and \u03c6\u0303k as follows: \u03c8\u0302(\u03b13 ) = \u2212 0\u03b13 dt 01\u2212t d\u03b11 \u03a6(\u03b11 , 1 \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 t, t),\nand \u03c6\u0302(\u03b1i ) = \u2212 0\u03b11 dt\u03a6(t, 1 \u2212 t \u2212 \u03b13 , \u03b13 ), with \u03a6 = \u03c6\u22a5 + \u03c6k + \u03c6\u0303\u22a5 + \u03c6\u0303k .\nThe sum rule for gf0 K + K \u2212 follows from the approximate equality of eqs.(8) and (9).\nR\n\nInvoking global quark-hadron duality, the contribution of the continuum in (8) can be\nidentified with the QCD contribution above the thresholds s0 , s\u20320 . This allows us to isolate the pole contribution in which the coupling appears. The matching between the\nexpressions in (8) and (9) can be improved performing two independent Borel transformations with respect to the variables \u2212p2 and \u2212(p + q)2 . Defining M12 and M22 as the\nBorel parameters associated to the channels p2 and (p + q)2 , respectively, and using the\nidentity:\n(M 2 )2\u2212l\nm2s + q 2 u(1 \u2212 u)\n(l \u2212 1)!\n=\nexp\n\u2212\n\u03b4(u \u2212 u0 )\nBM12 BM22 2\n[ms \u2212 (p + uq)2 ]l\nM12 M22\nM2\n!\n\n(16)\n\nM12 M22\nM12\nwith M = 2\nand u0 = 2\n, we get the following expression for the Borel\nM1 + M22\nM1 + M22\ntranformed eq.(9):\n2\n\nm\u03022\n0\n\nT1 (M12 , M22 )\n\n=\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\n1\nms\ne\u2212 M 2 M 2\n\u03c6p (u0 ) + \u03c6\u2032\u03c3 (u0 ) \u2212 2 2 g2 (u0 ) +\nfK MK2 2 2\nM1 M2 ms\n6\nMK\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ u0\nZ 1\u2212\u03b11\nu 0 \u2212 \u03b11 1\nd\u03b13\nf3K\n\u03c63K (\u03b11 , 1 \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b13 , \u03b13 ) 2\n\u2212\nd\u03b11\nfK 0\n\u03b13\n2\nu0 \u2212\u03b11 \u03b13\nZ 1\nms\nd\u03b13\n2 2 (1 \u2212 u0 )\n\u03c8\u0302(\u03b13 )\n(17)\n2\nM\n1\u2212u0 \u03b13\n\"Z\n#)\nZ\nZ 1\n1\u2212u0 d\u03b1 Z u0\nd\u03b13 1\u2212\u03b13\nms\n3\nd\u03b11 \u03c6\u0302(\u03b1i ) +\nd\u03b11 \u03c6\u0302(\u03b1i )\n2 2\nM\n\u03b13 u0 \u2212\u03b13\n1\u2212u0 \u03b13\nu0 \u2212\u03b13\n0\n(\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n6\n\n\fwhere m\u030220 = m2s + u0 (1 \u2212 u0 )MK2 .

(18)\n\nAs shown by (18), the Borel transformation exponentially suppresses the contribution\nof the higher states and of the continuum; furthermore, it removes possible subtraction\nterms in (4) which depend only on p2 or (p + q)2 .\nThe second term in (18) represents the continuum contribution. In order to identify\nit with part the QCD term (17), a prescription has been proposed in [27]. It consists\nin considering the symmetric points M12 = M22 = 2M 2 (corresponding to u0 = 1/2) in\nthe (M12 , M22 ) plane and performing the continuum subtraction through the substitution\nm\u03022\n0\n\nm\u03022\n0\n\ns0\n\ne\u2212 M 2 \u2192 e\u2212 M 2 \u2212 e\u2212 M 2 in the leading-twist term in (17). Such a prescription is not\nadeguate in our case, where the Borel parameters correspond to channels with different\nmass scales and should not be constrained to be equal. Here we can exploit the property\nof the amplitudes \u03c6p (u) and \u03c6\u03c3 (u) of being polynomials in u (or 1 \u2212 u):\nN\nX\n1 \u2032\n\u03c6p (u) + \u03c6\u03c3 (u) =\nbk (1 \u2212 u)k\n6\nk=0\n\n(19)\n\nin order to compute their contribution in the duality region D. As for the other terms in\n(17), they represent a small contribution to the QCD side of the sum rule, and therefore\nthe calculation can leave them unaffected.\nThe final expression for gf0 K + K \u2212 reads:\nM2\n\nM2\n\nf0\nK\nm\u03022\n1\n\u2212 02\nM2\nM2\n1\n2\nM\ne\ne\n=\ne\nMf0 f \u0303\n\ng f0 K + K \u2212\n\n(\n\nk\nN\nX\nAi\nM 2 M 2 Ak+1 i\nM 2 kh\nM 2 MK2 X\n\u2212A\n\u2212 2ms g2 (u0 )\n+ e\u2212A 2 K2\nbk ( 2 ) 1 \u2212 e\nms\nM1\nM1 M2 (k + 1)!\ni=0 i!\nk=0\n\n1\u2212\u03b11 d\u03b1\nf3K MK2 u0\nu 0 \u2212 \u03b11 1\n3\n\u03c63K (\u03b11 , 1 \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b13 , \u03b13 ) 2\n\u2212\nd\u03b11\nfK\n\u03b13\n2\n0\nu0 \u2212\u03b11 \u03b13\nZ 1\n2\n2ms MK\nd\u03b13\n+\n(1\n\u2212\nu\n)\n\u03c8\u0302(\u03b13 )\n(20)\n0\n2\nM2\n1\u2212u0 \u03b13\n\"Z\n#)\nZ\nZ 1\n1\u2212u0 d\u03b1 Z u0\nd\u03b13 1\u2212\u03b13\nms MK2\n3\nd\u03b11 \u03c6\u0302(\u03b1i ) +\nd\u03b11 \u03c6\u0302(\u03b1i ) ,\n\u2212 2\nM2\n\u03b13 u0 \u2212\u03b13\nu0 \u2212\u03b13\n0\n1\u2212u0 \u03b13\n\n+\n\ns0 \u2212m2s\nM2\nfor M12\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\nwith A =\n\nand s0 the smallest continuum threshold. The prescription in [27] is\n\nobtained\n\n= M22 , i = 0 and neglecting terms of order MK2 . An interesting feature\n7\n\n\fof eq.(20) is that, changing M12 and M22 independently, it is possible to vary the point\nu0 where the distribution amplitudes are evaluated and contribute, while in the standard\napproach the final result is essentially related to the value of the distribution amplitudes\nin a selected point.\nThe main nonperturbative quantities constituting the input information in the sum\nrule (20) are the kaon light-cone wave functions. A theoretical framework for their determination relies on an expansion in terms of matrix elements of conformal operators [28].\nFor the function \u03c6p , conformal expansion results in the expression\n\u03c6p (u, \u03bc) =\n\nX\n\n1\n\napk (\u03bc)Ck2 (\u03be)\n\n(21)\n\nk\n\nwith \u03be = 2u \u2212 1, ap0 = 1 and Ckl the Gegenbauer polynomials. In (21) we have included\nthe normalization scale dependence of the distribution amplitude \u03c6p , which appears in\nthe multiplicatively renormalizable coefficients apk (\u03bc). The nonperturbative information is\nencoded in the coefficients, which are peculiar for the various mesons. In the case of kaon,\nthe asymmetry between the strange and nonstrange quark momentum distribution in the\nmeson can be taken into account by non-vanishing odd-order coefficients apk . Such SU(3)\nflavour violating effects have not been investigated so far for distribution amplitudes of\ntwist larger than two, and we neglect them in the following, with consequences that we\nshall mention below. As for the even order coeficients, their updated values are reported\n81 2\nin [27, 29]: ap2 = 30\u03b73 \u2212 25 \u03c12 and ap4 = \u22123\u03b73 \u03c93 \u2212 27\n\u03c12 \u2212 10\n\u03c1 \u00e32 , with \u00e32 = 0.2, \u03b73 = 0.015,\n20\n\u03c93 = \u22123 at the scale \u03bc \u2243 1 GeV. We have taken into account the meson mass corrections,\n2\n\nms\nrelated to the parameter \u03c12 = M\n2 , worked out in [29].\nK\nAnalogously, the \u03c6\u03c3 distribution amplitude can be expressed as\n\n\u03c6\u03c3 (u, \u03bc) = 6u(1 \u2212 u)\n\nX\n\n3\n\na\u03c3k (\u03bc)Ck2 (\u03be)\n\n(22)\n\nk\n\n7 2\nwith a\u03c30 = 1, a\u03c32 = 5\u03b73 \u2212 21 \u03b73 \u03c93 \u2212 20\n\u03c1 \u2212 53 \u03c12 \u00e32 . For \u03c63K (\u03b1i ) and for the other higher twist\n\ndistribution amplitudes we refer to the expressions reported in [27, 29].\nIn the analysis of eq.(20) we use ms (1 GeV ) = 0.14 GeV [30], MK = 0.4937 GeV,\nMf = 0.980 GeV, fK = 0.160 GeV and f \u0303 = (0.180 \u00b1 0.015) GeV [19]. The threshold\n0\n\nparameter s0 is varied around the value s0 = 1.1 GeV2 fixed from the determination of\n\nfK using two-point sum rules [31].\nThe result for gf0 K + K \u2212 versus the Borel parameters M12 and M22 is depicted in fig.1. A\nstability region where the outcome does not depend on Mi2 can be selected.

Varying M12 and M22 in this region, and changing\nthe values of the thresholds and of the other parameters, we obtain the result depicted in\nfig.2, which can be quoted as 6.2 \u2264 gf0 K +K \u2212 \u2264 7.8 GeV.\nLet us briefly discuss the uncertainties affecting the numerical result. As for the\nSU(3)F breaking effects rendering the kaon distribution amplitudes asymmetric with respect to the middle point, the neglect should have a minor role in our approach, due to\nthe possibility of exploring wide ranges of the variable u and smoothing the effects of the\nactual shapes of the wave functions. Another uncertainty is related to the value of the\nstrange quark mass, ms ; since the dependence of the sum rule on ms mainly involves the\nratio MK2 /ms , one can fix this ratio using chiral perturbation theory, obtaining results in\nthe same range quoted for gf0 K + K \u2212 .\nWe can compare now our result with the available experimental determinations of\ngf0 K + K \u2212 , as well as with the results of other calculations. We shall see how complex the\nscenario is.\n\n9\n\n\f10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 2: Coupling gf0 K + K \u2212 as a function of the Borel parameter M22 , varying s0 in the\nrange 1.05 \u2264 s0 \u2264 1.15 GeV2 and M12 in the range 0.7 \u2264 M12 \u2264 2.0 GeV2 .\n\n3\n\nOther determinations of gf0 K + K \u2212\n\nAs discussed in the Introduction, gf0 K + K \u2212 can be considered in connection with the radiative \u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3 decay mode. Several analyses go through this decay channel. KLOE Col-\n\nlaboration at the DA\u03a6NE collider in Frascati has examined the decay channel \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\nmeasuring the branching fraction: B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3) = (1.09 \u00b1 0.03stat \u00b1 0.05syst) \u00d7 10\u22124\n[32]. The decay mode is supposed to proceed through \u03c1\u03c0 intermediate state and through\nkaon loop processes, with the kaons annihilating into scalar resonances that subsequently\nd\u0393\ndecay to \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . Different fits of the two pion invariant mass spectrum\nare perdM\u03c0\u03c0\nformed in order to measure the parameters of the scalar states. In a first fit (A) only\nthe contribution of the intermediate state f0 (980) is considered, and the three parameters\nMf0 , gf20 K + K \u2212 and gf20 K + K \u2212 /gf20 \u03c0\u03c0 are determined. In a second fit (B) the contribution\nof a possible broad scalar \u03c3 state is included, and the coupling g\u03c6\u03c3\u03b3 is considered as a\nfurther parameter. It is assumed that the two pion decay modes saturate the f0 width,\n\nand that B(f0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = 2 B(f0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) invoking isospin symmetry.

The negative interference between the contributions of the broad\n\u03c3 and the f0 is responsible of the improvement in the accuracy of the fit. In both cases\n\nFit B gives instead: B(\u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3) = (4.47 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10\u22124 and\n\nsizeable values for gf0 K + K \u2212 are obtained; they are reported in Table 1.\nAn analogous analysis has been performed by the CMD-2 Collaboration at the VEPP2M collider in Novosibirsk. From a combined fit to the spectra of the decays \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\nand \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3, CMD-2 Collaboration obtains: B(\u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3) = (2.90 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b1 0.65) \u00d7 10\u22124\ngf20 K + K \u2212\n= 1.48\u00b10.32 GeV 2 [33]. A similar result is quoted by the SND Collaboration\nand\n(4\u03c0)\ng2 + \u2212\n1.3\nat the same VEPP collider: B(\u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3) = (3.5 \u00b1 0.3\u00b10.5\n) \u00d7 10\u22124 and f0 K K =\n(4\u03c0)\n2\n2.47+0.73\nGeV\n[34].\n\u22120.51\nOther determinations of gf0 K + K \u2212 rely on the analysis of different physical processes.\nConsidering the central f0 production in pp collisions, the WA102 experiment at CERN\ngf20 K +K \u2212\ngets:\n= 0.38 \u00b1 0.06 GeV 2 [35]. On the other hand, analyzing the f0 production\n(4\u03c0)\nin Ds decays to three pions, the Collaboration E791 at Fermilab finds a value compatible\nwith zero [36]. These results are also reported in Table 1.\nIn Ref.[10] the coupling constant is evaluated for different values of the phase shift of\nthe elastic background in the \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 reaction, of the ratio R = gf20 K + K \u2212 /gf20 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 and\naccording to different scenarios for the f0 structure, obtaining results in a wide range:\ngf0 K + K \u2212 \u2208 [1.95, 7.3] GeV.\n\nThe analysis of the decay channel J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6KK(\u03c0\u03c0) has been carried out in Ref.[37].\nThe f0 pole is described as a Breit-Wigner resonance coupled to two channels. Two fits\nof the experimental data are performed depending upon the \u03c0\u03c0 phase shift data used,\nobtaining gf0 K + K \u2212 = 2.5 \u00b1 0.15 GeV and gf0 K + K \u2212 = 2.0 \u00b1 0.06 GeV, respectively.\n\nA prediction for gf0 K + K \u2212 based on chiral symmetry and the linear sigma model, when\nno mixing with the \u03c3 is considered, is: gf0 K + K \u2212 = 2.24 GeV [38], to be compared to old\n\ndeterminations gf0 K + K \u2212 = 2.74 GeV [39]. Using the method of the T-matrices, the value\ngf0 K + K \u2212 = 3.8 GeV is obtained [40].\nConsidering all the above results one sees that a general consensus on gf0 K + K \u2212 has not\nbeen reached, so far. In particular, experimental analyses of different processes produce\ncontradicting results. The outcome from \u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3 points towards sizeable values of the\n\ncoupling, consistent with the light-cone sum rule result. One has to say that the error\nquoted for the experimental determinations, which in general looks small, mainly accounts\n11\n\n\ffor the statistical uncertainties; one could infer the size of the systematical uncertainties\ncomparing different determinations.\nAs for gf0 K + K \u2212 from Ds decays, presumably the determination will be improved at\nthe B factories by experiments such as BaBar at SLAC, thanks to large available samples\nof Ds mesons. In these measurements gf0 K + K \u2212 is expected to be determined by coupled\nchannel analyses, with Ds decaying to final states containing kaons as well as pions [41].\nTable 1: Experimental determinations of gf0 K + K \u2212 using different physical processes.

In particular, the KLOE Collaboration measured a larger\nvalue than in other determinations, with a greater accuracy as well. However, such a\nresult stems from the investigation of \u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3, and therefore it is mandatory to wait\nfor the study of unrelated processes, namely the combined analysis of Ds decays to pions\nand kaons. The outcome of light-cone QCD sum rules is in keeping with a large value for\nthe coupling. The uncertainty affecting the result is intrinsic of the method and does not\nallow a better comparison with data. However, the analysis confirms a peculiar aspect of\nthe scalar states, i.e. their large hadronic couplings, thus pointing towards a scenario in\nwhich the process of hadronic dressing is favoured.\nAcknowledgments We thank A.
