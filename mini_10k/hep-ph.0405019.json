We determine the solar neutrino\noscillation parameters and obtain new bounds on \u03b8x . We also place constraints on the fraction of\noscillating solar neutrinos that transform to sterile neutrinos with the 8 B flux normalization left free.\nConcomitantly, we assess the sensitivity of future data from the SNO and KamLAND experiments\nto \u03b8x and to the sterile neutrino content of the solar flux.\n\nThe SNO [1] and KamLAND [2] experiments have been\ncrucial in selecting the Large Mixing Angle (LMA) solution [3], thereby solving the long-standing solar neutrino\nproblem. Additional KamLAND data [4] have narrowed\nthe two-neutrino oscillation parameter space even further [4, 5]. We perform a more general three-neutrino\nanalysis of KamLAND and solar neutrino data including the cumulative salt-phase SNO data announced recently [6]. We refine the existing upper bound on \u03b8x 1 . We\nalso explore if future data from KamLAND and SNO can\nplay an important role in the study of neutrino physics\nbeyond the determination of the primary solar oscillation\nparameters.\nOne of the main goals of ongoing and planned neutrino experiments is a measurement of \u03b8x , and if it is\nlarge enough, to determine if CP is violated in the neutrino sector [7]. Today, we know from the CHOOZ [8]\nand Palo Verde [9] experiments that sin2 2\u03b8x \u2264 0.19 at\nthe 90% C. L. for \u03b4m2a = 0.002 eV2 ; our analysis below\nyields sin2 2\u03b8x \u2264 0.17. Data from the K2K experiment\nhave established an independent and consistent bound,\nsin2 2\u03b8x \u2264 0.45 for the same \u03b4m2a [10]2 ; further support that \u03b8x is small is obtained from Super-Kamiokande\n(SuperK) atmospheric data [11]. Long-baseline experiments such as MINOS [12] and the CERN to Gran Sasso\n(CNGS) experiments, ICARUS [13] and OPERA [14],\nwill begin the hunt for \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde transitions resulting from\na nonzero \u03b8x in the near future. Within five years of running they could have compelling evidence for such transformations or they will strengthen the CHOOZ bound.\nIn the meantime, however, there is a possibility that additional solar neutrino data may provide guidance on the\nsize of \u03b8x . A constraint from solar neutrino data is independent of \u03b4m2a so long as it is much larger than \u03b4m2s .\nThis is especially important because the values of \u03b4m2a\n\n1\n\n2\n\nWe use the notation of Ref. [7] in which \u03b4m2a and \u03b4m2s are the\natmospheric and solar mass-squared differences, and \u03b8a , \u03b8s and\n\u03b8x are the mixing angles conventionally denoted by \u03b823 , \u03b812 and\n\u03b813 , respectively.\nThe aforementioned limits are quoted for two degrees of freedom.\n\nfrom the SuperK collaboration's analyses have shifted\nwith additional data and refinements in the analyses (in\nquite a narrow range which, however, sensitively affects\nconclusions about the size of \u03b8x ); compare the results\nfrom a zenith-angle analysis [15] and from an L/E analysis [16]. If \u03b4m2a turns out to be smaller than 0.001 eV2 ,\nthen the CHOOZ bound will be inoperable, and solar\ndata will provide the most stringent bound on \u03b8x ; even\nMINOS and the CNGS experiments will not do better.\nAlthough we have no reason to believe that this will be\nthe case, we mention this as a hypothetical possibility under which solar/KamLAND data provide the best bound\non \u03b8x . After all, the K2K experiment confirms the \u03b4m2a\nvalues from SuperK at the 2\u03c3 C. L. [17].\nMore realistically, we investigate if future solar data\ncan improve on the CHOOZ bound for the \u03b4m2a values\nthat are consistent with SuperK and K2K.\nAnother unresolved issue is whether solar neutrinos oscillate into sterile species [18]. We know from solar data\nthat the possibility that solar neutrinos oscillate exclusively to sterile states is excluded at 7.6\u03c3 [7]. However,\nit is easily conceivable that solar \u03bde oscillate into both\nactive and sterile neutrinos. The latter scenario is not\nsatisfactorily constrained at present, and significant improvement in this direction is unlikely in the near future [19]. We evaluate how future SNO and KamLAND\ndata may confirm and somewhat improve existing bounds\non a sterile fraction in the solar flux with minimal dependence on the Standard Solar Model (SSM) and without\nresort to involved global analyses of strongly correlated\ndatasets from many experiments.\nAll the 3 He proportional counter tubes or neutral current detectors are installed and are taking data for the\nthird phase of the SNO experiment. The future NC measurement is expected to have an overall uncertainty (statistical and systematic uncertainties combined) of about\n6.4%. At the same time an improved CC integrated flux\nmeasurement will be made with an expected overall uncertainty of about 5.5%. To a good approximation, these\nmeasurements will be uncorrelated with previous measurements and with each other. We use these expectations in our analyses.\n\n\f2\n-2\n\n10\n\n2\n\n\u03b4ma (eV )\n\n2\n\nsin 2\u03b8x\n\n0.3\n\n\u2715\n\n2\n\n0.1\n\n-4\n\n\u2715\n\n\u2715\n\n2\n\n\u03b4ms (eV )\n\n1\u00d710\n\n-3\n\n2\n\n10\n\n6\u00d710\n\n-5\n\n0.3\n\n2\n\ntan \u03b8s\n\n0.7\n\n0.1\n\n2\n\nsin 2\u03b8x\n\n-1\n\n0.3\n\n10\n\nFIG. 1: The 90% C.

[21].\nThe regions of parameter space allowed by existing\nCHOOZ, KamLAND and solar data are shown in Fig. 1.\nThe effect of how future data from the SNO experiment will impact our knowledge of \u03b8x is comprehensively\nrepresented in Fig. 2. The figure clearly suggests that\nfuture SNO data will not have a significant impact on\nexisting bounds, especially for \u03b4m2a values relevant to atmospheric neutrino oscillations.\nSensitivity to sterile neutrinos:\nIn a scenario in which oscillations to sterile neutrinos are allowed, the fraction of oscillating neutrinos that\ntransform to active neutrinos is (in terms of quantities\nmeasured by SNO) [19],\nsin2 \u03b1 =\n\n\u03a6N C \u2212 \u03a6CC\n.\n\u03a68 B \u2212 \u03a6CC\n\n(1)\n\nThe current constraints on sin2 \u03b1 are shown in Fig. 3.\n\n2\n\nsin 2\u03b8x\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFIG. 2: Estimates of how future SNO data will affect bounds\non \u03b8x . The shaded curved bands depict the effect of future\nSNO 6.4% NC and 5.5% CC measurements (whose central\nvalues lie within their current 1\u03c3 values) on bounds from all\nexisting CHOOZ, KamLAND and solar neutrino data. The\nthick (thin) solid curves are the 90% C. L. (3\u03c3) bounds from\ncurrent CHOOZ, KamLAND and solar data. The dotted\ncurves are the corresponding CHOOZ bounds. The horizontal\nshaded regions encompass the values of \u03b4m2a favored by SuperK atmospheric data at the 90% and 99% C. L. [15]. The\n8\nB flux normalization is a free parameter in our analyses.\n\nThe most stringent bound from all available solar and\nKamLAND data is sin2 \u03b1 \u2265 0.91 (0.65) at 1\u03c3 (3\u03c3). Our\nestimates are conservative since the 8 B flux normalization\nis left free in the analyses.\nOur knowledge of sin2 \u03b1 can be refined if we can observationally infer the 8 B flux produced in the Sun. We\nnow describe such a method.\nThe KamLAND experiment which detects \u03bd\u0304e from surrounding nuclear reactors will determine the solar oscillation parameters to 10% precision independently of solar\nphysics. These parameters can be used as inputs in analyses of SNO data to extract the average \u03bde survival probability measured by SNO. The solar flux can be obtained\nvia\n\u03a68 B = \u03a6CC /Pee ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Pee is the average survival probability of \u03bde at\nSNO. It has been shown in Ref. [22] that with a few years\nof KamLAND data, Pee should be known to about 7%\nfor parameters in the LMA region obtained from solar\ndata.

From bottom to top, the horizontal dotted lines indicate the \u2206\u03c72 values\ncorresponding to 1\u03c3, 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3.\n\nand sterile fraction allowed by current data, they have\nlittle effect on Pee .\nThe dotted lines in Fig. 4 are iso-sin2 \u03b1 lines and the\nsolid lines are iso-\u03c3sin2 \u03b1 / sin2 \u03b1 lines, or lines with the\nsame fractional uncertainty in the \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 content at 1\u03c3.\nAlthough sin2 \u03b1 > 1 values are unphysical, they are experimentally obtainable since \u03a6N C could be measured to\nbe higher than \u03a6SSM . The figure should be interpreted\nas follows: Each point marks the central values of the\n\u03a6N C and \u03a6CC measurements with 6.4% and 5.5% uncertainties, respectively. The solid line passing through\neach point gives the corresponding \u03c3sin2 \u03b1 / sin2 \u03b1. Since\nthe expected uncertainties on \u03a6N C and \u03a6CC are incorporated in the solid lines, one should not plot the measurements with their uncertainties to read-off the envelope of\n\u03c3sin2 \u03b1 / sin2 \u03b1.\nIn Fig. 4, from left to right, we show our expectations\nfor \u03c3sin2 \u03b1 / sin2 \u03b1 for Pee = 0.28, 0.33 and 0.38, all with\n7% uncertainties. Since both the solid and dotted lines\nhave slopes higher than 2.5, both \u03c3sin2 \u03b1 / sin2 \u03b1 and sin2 \u03b1\nwill have greater sensitivity to the value of \u03a6CC than to\nthe value of \u03a6N C . We conclude that \u03c3sin2 \u03b1 / sin2 \u03b1 will\nbe known to 16\u201317%. These projections are comparable\nwith existing bounds as represented by the dashed line\nof Fig. 3.\nSince these expectations are based only on future SNO\nand KamLAND data, they are conservative.

(2) and Pee is determined\nby KamLAND with 7% uncertainty. From left to right, the\nthree panels are for three possible measurements, Pee = 0.28,\n0.33 and 0.38, respectively. The \"+\" signs mark the current\ncentral values of \u03a6NC (=4.94) and \u03a6CC (=1.68) measured by\nSNO.\n\nlar data. Joint analyses of solar data are dictated by the\npaucity of the data. With the future availability of larger\ndatasets it will be worthwhile to perform more definitive\nanalyses of data from experiments which do not have correlations with each other (such as SNO and KamLAND).\nConclusions:\nIn a three-neutrino framework, our analysis of all existing KamLAND, CHOOZ and solar neutrino data yields\n\u22125\n\u03b4m2s = 8.0+0.7\neV2 ,\n\u22120.6 \u00d7 10\n\ntan2 \u03b8s = 0.45+0.17\n\u22120.12 ,\n\nwhere the uncertainties are at the 2\u03c3 C. L. Current\nbounds on \u03b8x are significantly improved for lower values of \u03b4m2a favored by SuperK. For the SuperK best-fit\n\u03b4m2a = 0.002 eV2 , the CHOOZ upper limit is slightly\nimproved by KamLAND and solar data to\nsin2 2\u03b8x \u2264 0.13 (0.20)\nat the 90% C. L. (3\u03c3).\nThe fraction of solar neutrinos oscillating into active\nneutrinos is greater than (0.91) 0.65 at 1\u03c3 (3\u03c3) from all\nexisting solar and KamLAND data.\nA substantially improved constraint on \u03b8x from future\nSNO data should not be anticipated unless \u03b4m2a is at the\nlower edge of what SuperK atmospheric data prefer (in\nwhich case, the CHOOZ data are not very constraining).\n\n\f4\nWith future SNO and KamLAND data alone, it will\nbe possible to know the fraction of solar neutrinos transforming to active species to a precision of 16\u201317% at\n1\u03c3. This will be an important confirmation of existing\nbounds because the SNO and KamLAND datasets are\ncompletely uncorrelated with each other. A nonnegligible sterile neutrino component in the solar flux incident\non the earth will remain a possibility.\nAcknowledgments: We thank A.
