Some (such as Her X-1 and LMC X-4) are remarkably stable, but\nothers show a range of properties, from even longer variability time-scales to quite\nchaotic behaviour.\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Galactic population of X-ray binaries (XRBs) are X-ray\nluminous, interacting binaries in which a donor star (M2 )\ntransfers material to a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH)\ncompact object (MX ). Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs)\ncontain donor stars < 1M\u2299 and typically have orbital periods (Porb ) ranging from hours to days (Liu, van Paradijs\n& van den Heuvel 2007), while high mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) have donor stars > 10M\u2299 and Porb \u223c several\ndays to tens of days (Liu, van Paradijs & van den Heuvel\n2006).\nFrom the very first decade of satellite X-ray astronomy (the 1970s), long-term monitoring revealed modulations\nthat were quasi-periodic on time-scales substantially longer\nthan their well-established orbital periods. These included\nresults from missions such as Ariel V's All Sky Monitor\n(e.g. Kaluzienski et al. 1976) and Vela 5B (e.g. Priedhorsky\n& Terrell 1983, 1984). Her X-1, with its 35 d on/off cycle\n(which is remarkably stable, at \u223c 20 \u00d7 Porb ) exhibits the\nprototypical \"superorbital\" period (Petterson 1977).\n\n1.1\n\nLong-term variations\n\nSuch superorbital variations (Psup ) are seen to occur on\ntime-scales of tens to hundreds of days, and are thought\nto be related to the properties of the accretion disc (and\noccasionally linked to the donor). Many of these have been\ndetermined for a number of sources, using archival data from\nlater X-ray satellite missions such as CGRO's BATSE (e.g.\nRobinson et al. 1997), RXTE's All Sky Monitor (ASM; e.g.\nWen et al. 2006) and Swift's Burst Alert Telescope (e.g.\nFarrell, Barret & Skinner 2009). Most recently, superorbital\n\nbehaviour and the various mechanisms proposed to account\nfor it, have been summarised in Charles et al. (2008, 2010).\nRadiation-induced warping (Ogilvie & Dubus 2001,\nhereafter OD01) and/or precession (Whitehurst & King\n1991) of the accretion disc may lead to periodic/quasiperiodic superorbital modulation of the X-ray flux, e.g. Cyg\nX-2, Her X-1, LMC X-4 & SMC X-1 (Clarkson et al. 2003).\nHowever, superorbital variations may also occur as the result\nof other mechanisms. Here we briefly introduce the physical\nprocesses that have been proposed.\n\n1.1.1\n\nDisc Precession\n\nPrecession of accretion discs may occur if q <0.25-0.33, due\nto resonances excited in the discs resulting from tidal interaction with the donor (Whitehurst & King 1991). This\noccurs in the SU UMa sub-class of Cataclysmic Variables\n(CVs; Warner 1995) and the soft X-ray Transients (SXTs;\nO'Donoghue & Charles 1996), containing white dwarfs\n(WD) and BH compact objects respectively. It is very likely\nalso to occur in ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs; e.g.\nX1916-053) where the donor itself is degenerate (Nelemans\n2004).\n\n1.1.2\n\nRadiation-induced Warping/Tilting\n\nThis is the original superorbital mechanism that was proposed to account for the 35d cycle in Her X-1 by Petterson (1977). Subsequently developed by Wijers and Pringle\n(1999), the most detailed analysis to date is that of OD01.\nThey showed how accretion discs can develop radiationinduced warps that are functions of their binary separation\n\n\f2\n\nM.M. Kotze & P.A. Charles\n1.1.3\n\nMagnetic Warping\n\nPfeiffer & Lai (2004) carried out numerical simulations of\nviscous accretion discs driven by the magnetic torque in the\ninner disc, resulting from the interaction between the induced electric currents in the disc and the accreting object's\n\u2192\n\u2212\nmagnetic field ( B ). They show that an accretion disc surrounding a magnetic star (T Tauri star, WD or NS) can\ndevelop warps in the inner disc that steadily precess. The\nretrograde precession as observed in Her X-1, is successfully\nreproduced by their simulations. They suggest that changes\nin \u1e40 can cause discs to switch between warped and flat.\n1.1.4\n\nWind-driven Tilting\n\nSchandl & Meyer (1994) proposed an alternative mechanism\nfor the tilted disc observed for Her X-1, involving the coronal\nwind torque in combination with viscous and tidal torques,\nwherein the coronal wind exerts a repulsive force on the disc\n(but see also the analysis and discussion concerning the coronal model in Scott, Leahy & Wilson (2000)). Quillen (2001)\nproposed that a supersonic wind passing over the accretion\ndisc may cause surface instabilities. Moreover, Montgomery\n& Martin (2010) suggest it may also cause lift due to the\ndiffering speeds above and below the disc, causing a pitch of\nthe disc around its line of nodes, thereby tilting it.\n1.1.5\nFigure 1. OD01 stability analysis for radiation-driven warping\nin X-ray binaries, using \u03b1 = 0.3 and \u01eb = 0.1 (adapted from\nFig.7 in OD01, including only sources with known Psup ), where\nrb has units [GMX /c2 ] and q is dimensionless. The upper two\nlines (solid & dashed) correspond to the first two bending modes\nfor radd = rc (mode 0 starting higher than mode 1). Sustained\nstable warps are only possible close to the solid portions of those\ncurves, while warps become increasingly variable/unstable as the\ndashed curves are approached and crossed. The instability zone\nlies between these solid and dashed curves. The bottom solid line\ncorresponds to mode 1 for radd = ro , below which discs are unlikely to experience radiation-driven warping. The region between\nthe bottom and top solid lines are considered an intermediate instability zone where a disc may display warping cycles as it alternates between being warped and being flat. Squares indicate\nLMXBs and circles HMXBs. The grey vertical dashed line indicates the q \u223c0.33 boundary (Whitehurst & King 1991), to the\nleft of which sources are susceptible to disc precession resulting\nfrom tidal interactions with the donor.\n\n(rb ) and mass ratio (q = M2 /MX ). The stability of such\nwarps is defined in this analysis by the range of values for\nthe mass input radius (radd ), with boundary values set by\nthe circularization radius (rc ) and the outer disc radius (ro ).\n(See Fig.1 for further details.)\nOD01 ignored tidal torque and assumed a viscosity parameter (\u03b1 = 0.3) and accretion efficiency (\u01eb = 0.1) that\nwere considered reasonable for persistent X-ray binaries in\ngeneral. It is expected that chaotic (e.g. Cyg X-2) or unstable (e.g. SMC X-1) warping may result in quasi-periodic\nsuperorbital variations, while precession of stable/sustained\nwarps (e.g. Her X-1 & LMC X-4) should result in steady,\nalmost strictly periodic superorbital modulations.\n\nX-ray State Changes\n\nLong-term modulation of the mass transfer rate (\u1e40 )\nthrough their discs has been associated with dramatic \"state\nchanges\" in the X-ray spectra of many sources (of which\nCyg X-1 and GX339-4 have provided frequent demonstrations). This is particularly true for the SXTs (McClintock &\nRemillard 2006 and references therein) and luminous galactic bulge sources (van der Klis 2006 and references therein).\nIn such cases, the mass transfer rate is intermediate between\nthe stable high and low spectral states, and so occasional\ntransitions will occur. Super-orbital periods detected in such\nsystems may therefore indicate the time-scales associated\nwith such transitions (see e.g. King et al. 1997).\nQuasi-persistent XRBs (e.g. KS 1731-260 & X1636-536)\ncan display prolonged high (on) and low (off) intervals, characterized by markedly different flux levels during those times\n(Charles et al. 2008). During the decline from the high to the\nlow state, X1636-536 displayed an anti-correlation between\nthe hard and soft X-rays as well as superorbital variations\nconsistent with modulations of \u1e40 comparable with the viscous time-scale in the outer disc (Shih et al. 2005, 2011).\n1.1.6\n\nPrecessing Relativistic Jets\n\nThe archetypal galactic micro-quasar is the well-known\nSS433 (Hjellming & Johnston 1981; Margon 1984), which\ndisplays the remarkable \"moving lines\" in its optical spectrum with radial velocities that are truly relativistic. These\nare now well-established as arising from precessing relativistic jets, a process which imparts substantial stability to the\n162 d superorbital period. The jets and their corkscrew motion have been directly (spatially) observed at radio wavelengths (Blundell, Bowler & Schmidtobreick 2007), although\nthe detailed properties of the 13 d orbital period XRB at\n\n\fAn Overview of Long-term Variability in X-ray Binaries\nthe heart of SS433 remain poorly determined (e.g. Barnes\net al. 2006). The driving mechanism for the jet precession in\nSS433 is still a matter of controversy, but irradiation driven\noutflows are likely to play a significant role, as discussed in\ne.g. Begelman et al (2006).\n1.1.7\n\nThird Body\n\nThe most luminous LMXB in a galactic globular cluster is\nX1820-303 (at the core of NGC 6624). With close to the\nshortest orbital period (\u223c12 mins), it should not be susceptible to radiation-induced disc warping as suggested by OD01.\nBut its very low q (the donor is a very low mass degenerate\nhelium dwarf), does make it a prime candidate for tidal disc\nprecession effects. Nevertheless, the extremely stable superorbital period which has been observed in X1820-303 is considered a likely consequence of the effect of a third body on\nthe \u1e40 in the system (Chou & Grindlay, 2001). Such triple\nsystems involving an XRB have long been mooted, especially\nwithin the extremely dense stellar regions of globular cluster\ncores, but this system remains the strongest candidate.\n1.1.8\n\nBe X-ray Binaries\n\nWhen a NS in a highly eccentric orbit passes through, or\ninteracts with, the varying equatorial disc surrounding a\nrapidly rotating Be-star, it naturally gives rise to a modulation at the orbital frequency (see e.g. Leahy & Kostka 2008\nand references therein, and Hayasaki & Okazaki 2006). However, there are longer term variations in which the equatorial\ndisc expands and contracts which will give rise to a modulation of the accreted fraction on this superorbital time-scale\n(Charles et al. 2008). These are the Be X-ray binaries (BeX),\nwhich display a wide variety of variations at X-ray & optical wavelengths, extending to time-scales much longer than\nbeing considered here (Rajoelimanana, Charles & Udalski\n2011).\n1.2\n\nTime-dependent Period Analysis\n\nPeriods are typically identified by applying a periodic analysis to the entire available dataset to produce a periodogram.\nWhile this approach allows one to distinguish between periodic (sharp peaks) and quasi-periodic (broadened or multiple peaks) behaviour, it is essentially limited to the identification (not characterization) of periodic signals (Wen et al.\n2006).\nHowever, from our brief introduction to the variety of\nphysical mechanisms that can induce superorbital variations, it will be clear that some of these can be intermittent, or vary in time-scale so much as to be rendered undetectable in a summed periodogram. Consequently, such\nbehaviour should be analysed in a way that displays the\n\"instantaneous\" modulations present in the data, and then\nfollow this as a function of time.\nA time-dependent periodic analysis of two HMXBs and\ntwo LMXBs in the form of Dynamic Power Spectra (DPS;\ne.g. Clarkson et al. 2003), clearly illustrated the need for\na more comprehensive approach in the study of superorbital periods. Therein the Psup in SMC X-1 was seen to\nevolve dramatically and systematically, while those in Her\n\n3\n\nX-1 and LMC X-4 remained essentially steady in period,\nalthough the modulation in Her X-1 would occasionally disappear completely e.g. Still et al. (2004). In contrast, the\nPsup observed in Cyg X-2 appeared to be highly variable\nand unstable.\nThe DPS technique is well established and the X-ray\nburst community uses a variant of it routinely (e.g. Fig.19 in\nWatts et al. (2005)). However, since it requires significantly\nmore computations than the typical period analysis, its application was limited in the past. Recent advances in desktop\ntechnology allow this technique to be employed more readily\nthan before.\nAnother approach to unravel the time-dependence of\nthese long-term periods was recently developed by Hu et\nal. 2011, and this is the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT).\nHu et al applied the HHT to the same SMC X-1 dataset as\nused here, and find that the HHT is consistent with results\nobtained from the DPS. They suggest that it may be able\nto show more detail in the frequency and time domains.\nBoyd & Smale (2004) applied time-frequency decomposition techniques to the long-term RXTE ASM lightcurves\nof three XRBs, separating them into random and periodic\ncomponents. They suggest that all the Psup modulations\nin Cyg X-2 are integer multiples of its Porb , although they\nconcede that competing warping modes (suggested in OD01)\ncould be considered as one of several mechanisms which may\npossibly be responsible for its long-term variations.\n\n1.3\n\nTarget Details\n\nWith an RXTE observational baseline that has doubled, we\nrevisit the 4 sources of Clarkson et al. (2003). In addition,\nwe apply the same analysis to the other 14 sources showing\nPsup behaviour and summarised in Charles et al. (2008). A\nfurther 7 sources, not contained therein or published since,\nwere also included in our target list.\nHere we present a time-resolved periodic analysis of all\n25 sources with previously published or claimed Psup <1\nyr, many of which have been inferred to be associated with\nwarped and/or precessing accretion discs. Consequently, we\nendeavour to provide a comprehensive overview of the longterm behaviour of the majority of superorbital modulations\nobserved in X-ray binaries, through this systematic DPS approach.

While period analysis of the entire\ndataset can provide the maximum sensitivity to low-level\nmodulations (if they are steady), it has serious limitations\nwhen dealing with unstable or evolving periodic signals. Signals that are intermittent may be completely damped out,\nand evolving signals may cause multiple peaks over a much\nlarger frequency range than is expected for so-called quasiperiodic oscillations (see e.g. van der Klis 2006). These effects get worse with longer observational baselines. Since\nsuperorbital periods relating to accretion disc behaviour are\nexpected to be quasi-periodic, or could be unstable and may\ndrift systematically, our interest rather lies in characterising\nthe behaviour of those periods over time.\n2.2.1\n\nPorb [d]\n\n0.008\n0.035\n0.390\n\na Sum-band (1.5-12 keV). One-day-average data are the\ndwell-by-dwell data binned into 1-day bins. Archival ASM\ndatasets contain the lightcurves of all X-ray sources in the\nRXTE catalogue. For full details see Levine et al. (1996) and\nhttp://xte.mit.edu/.\n\nWindowing\n\nThe Dynamic Power Spectrum (DPS) method employed\nby Clarkson et al. (2003) has the advantage of illustrating very clearly whether periodic signals are sustained, and\nwhether they are stable or drifting in period (although the\nmethod is also sensitive to phase drifts; Clarkson et al. 2003).\nThe method requires the datasets to be split into windows\nthat are of sufficient length to allow detection of the maximum period considered. A Lomb-Scargle (L-S) periodogram\n(Lomb 1976 & Scargle 1982, 1989) was produced for every\nsuch dataset and the results of all the periodograms for a\nsource were plotted together in a density map, using the LS power for each frequency plotted at every window's midpoint along the time-axis. The frequency domain covered\nperiods with a minimum of 2 d to a maximum comparable\nto the window size.\nLarger window sizes cause the smearing out of variability as it averages out small variations, but it has the advantage of enhancing sustained periodic signals. However,\nvariable or intermittent periodic signals may be completely\nwashed out if windows are too large. Window sizes were initially chosen to be 400 d for all sources, since it provides\ncoverage of \u223c5-10 periodic cycles in the range \u223c40-80 d and\nit has the advantage of being directly comparable to the earlier results already published for SMC X-1, LMC X-4, Her\nX-1 & Cyg X-2 (Clarkson et al. 2003). It also allowed us to\nidentify longer potential periods, which could then be investigated in more detail by choosing more appropriate window\nsizes to sample them properly. For periods >80 d, windows\nof \u223c5 times the periods were used for the results presented\nhere, and for periods <10 d, we used 100 d windows.\nA sliding window approach was also employed, whereby\nconsecutive datasets overlap such that they move in 50 d\nsteps in the time domain. This approach provides adequate\ntemporal resolution, whilst smoothing out the noise from\notherwise independent windows that will occur.\n\n\fAn Overview of Long-term Variability in X-ray Binaries\n2.2.2\n\nDynamic Window Function\n\nTo ensure that the features contained in the DPS are not artificially induced by the sampling or windowing employed,\nthe spectral window function was determined for each\ndataset and a density map was constructed with that information. The resulting Dynamic Window Function (DWF)\nwas compared to the DPS for each source. No significant\nfeatures contained in the DPS were repeated in the DWF of\nany source considered here.\n2.2.3\n\nDwell-by-dwell data\n\nThe DPS analysis was also repeated for 1-day averages that\nwere constructed from the dwell-by-dwell data, employing\naggressive filtering of the data to eliminate possibly dubious\ndata points, as suggested on the RXTE ASM website. Those\nresults are consistent with what we present here. However,\nthe data loss due to the more conservative approach, does\nlead to diminished temporal coverage. We find that the features in the DPS are in general clearer using the ASM 1-day\naverages, which allows better coverage, and are therefore the\nresults presented here.\n2.2.4\n\nNoise Levels\n\nWhite noise (frequency independent) levels were determined\nfor each complete 15 year one-day-average dataset by generating 104 random datasets by Monte Carlo simulation, assuming a white noise distribution and using the time values,\nmean and standard deviation of the dataset. Lomb-Scargle\nperiodograms for each random dataset yield periods associated with the maximum power in each, and the subsequent\ndistribution of powers amount to a cumulative probability\ndistribution function, providing the false alarm probability\n(result of white noise) associated with a particular power.\nThe white noise level for a 99.99% confidence level, is the\npower associated with a false alarm probability of 0.01%.\nThe noise level for the dataset as a whole can be used as\nan estimate for its windows and is not expected to differ\nsignificantly between sources.\nRed noise (frequency dependent) levels for the RXTE\nASM data, determined by Farrell, Barret & Skinner (2009)\nfor 5 of these sources, indicated that the red noise levels do\nnot always exceed the white noise at the low frequencies. For\nSco X-1 and X1916-053 the white noise levels were \u223cdouble\nthose of the red noise, while Cyg X-2, X1636-536 & X1820303 had red noise levels that rose to >3 times the white noise\nlevels at low frequencies (0.001-0.01). Apart from differing\nsignificantly for each source, these modelled red noise levels\nare extremely dependent on the time domain covered by the\ndataset, as well as the weighting scheme applied to it, if any.\nHowever, the aim of this paper is to characterize the\nbehaviour of previously reported periodic signals over time,\nnot claim the discovery of new periodic behaviour. The latter\nwould normally require rigorous testing against noise, while\nsuch requirements should be irrelevant in case of the former. While noise levels may serve as an accepted statistical\nmeasure for the significance of prominent periodic signals,\nthe true measure of their significance lies in their persistence over time, which a time-dependent periodic analysis\nprovides automatically.\n\n2.3\n\n5\n\nResults\n\nTo allow easier interpretation of features in the power density maps (the 2-D representation of 3-D data) and how they\ntranslate to features contained in the lightcurves, the DPS\n(from the Sum-band one-day-average data) are plotted, together with the lightcurve of each source. The light-curves\nshown were re-binned into 10-day bins and plotted above\nthe DPS, over the same temporal range (horizontal/x-axis).\nFurthermore, the L-S periodogram for the entire 15 year\ndataset was plotted to the left of the DPS for each source\nand over the same frequency range (vertical/y-axis). This\nallows immediate comparison of features in the DPS to the\noverall periodogram. Frequency labels were replaced by the\nequivalent period labels, to facilitate easier comparison with\npreviously published Psup .\nKnown Psup contained in Tables 1 & 2 are mentioned in\nthe caption of each source and are also clearly indicated on\neach plot with ticks along the period/frequency-axis (red in\nthe online version of this paper). The density scale-bar included in each plot indicates the power (line-of-sight/z-axis)\nassociated with the periodogram, with stronger detections\nbeing darker.\nDPS and L-S plots were produced for frequencies appropriate to their reported superorbital periods. Including\na wider range of frequencies around those periods allows a\nmore complete picture of the temporal properties of each\nsource. In an effort to allow comparability between sources,\nthe size of the frequency range plotted was kept relatively\nconstant at \u223c0.02-0.03 for all the plots, except that sources\nwith Psup <10 d were plotted over a frequency range of 0.1.\nWe only include the plot for the Psup \u223c199 d in X1916-053\n(Fig.25), since we find no evidence for the Psup \u223c5 d.\nThe estimated white noise levels for all sources are, not\nsurprisingly, quite similar, being in the range from 15.6-16.8;\nthey are plotted as vertical lines (green in the online version\nof this paper) on the L-S plots of the sources as a guide.\nProminent features in the L-S periodogram which are well\nabove these estimated white noise levels, can normally be\nconsidered significant, the situation for the majority of the\nsources considered here. Only in Figs. 9, 19 & 20 were no\nsignificant features detected in the L-S or DPS at any time.\nOur aim here is to present the results in a way that provides the reader with sufficient information to reach their\nown conclusion regarding the variability properties of a\nsource at a single glance. All relevant additional information, not contained in the plots themselves, was therefore\nincluded in the caption of each source. The figures for the\nsources are presented in the same order as their listing in Tables 1 & 2, with the HMXBs presented before the LMXBs.\nWhile the results presented here certainly include most\nof the X-ray binaries with published superorbital periods,\nwe do not claim to have included all sources for which superorbital periods have been published, nor do we claim to\nhave included all X-ray binaries that have ever displayed superorbital behaviour. However, those included here do have\nsuperorbital periods that have been proposed to be associated with warped and/or precessing accretion discs at some\nstage. Their inclusion is intended as an opportunity to study\nsuch features using the DPS approach, thereby indicating\nwhether such modulations were steady, evolving, persistent\nor intermittent.\n\n\f6\n\nM.M.

(2003). We will then discuss the remainder of those in\nCharles et al. (2008) plus 7 additional sources. For each\nsource we explicitly discuss its stability to radiation-driven\nwarping under the OD01 framework. We remind the reader\nthat we are not claiming that radiation-driven warping must\nexplain superorbital periodicities for all sources.\nDetermining the behaviour of the previously reported\nsuperorbital periods required a time-dependent method, as\nsuggested in OD01. They predicted that systems able to\nproduce steady superorbital periods resulting from stable,\nsteadily precessing, warped discs (as in Her X-1), should be\nrare, and variable/chaotic warping would result in a variety\nof quasi-periodic or aperiodic behaviour in the majority of\nsources. Our results here show that this prediction is largely\nborne out. While Fig.1 provides us with the OD01 stability\npredictions for individual sources, some were discussed in\nmore detail in OD01 and where relevant we refer to those\ncomments, since they pertain to deviations from the predictions implied in the figure.\n3.1\n\nThe Clarkson et al. (2003) sources\n\nOur DPS results for Her X-1, SMC X-1, LMC X-4 and Cyg\nX-2 are consistent with those presented in Clarkson et al.\n(2003) and those included in the Charles et al. (2008) review. However, the observational baseline used here has approximately doubled. These four sources therefore represent\ngood examples with which the long-term behaviour of the\nsuperorbital periods of other sources can be compared, particularly in terms of OD01 disc instability.\n3.1.1\n\nSMC X-1 (Fig.6)\n\nStill by far the most intriguing of all our results, the DPS of\nthis HMXB clearly shows the smooth and steady evolution\nof its Psup over the range \u223c42-70 d. The behaviour early in\nthe light-curve (the feature surrounding MJD\u223c50500), also\nincluded in Clarkson et al. (2003) and Trowbridge, Nowak\n\n& Wilms (2007), now appears to be repeated approximately\n10 years later (around MJD\u223c54000). There also appear to\nbe a decrease in maximum and increase in minimum 10day binned flux coincident with the temporal location of the\nminimum superorbital periods in those two features in the\nDPS curve. The behaviour after these two largest features\ndoes not repeat, but appears to be similar in terms of the\ndecreased period range covered, and contains features that\nseem to recur on a time-scale of \u223c1000 d.\nSMC X-1 lies in the instability zone on Fig.1. However, it is situated closer to the dashed curve and therefore\na radiation-induced warp in its accretion disc is expected to\nbe variable, though not yet unstable. The steady evolution of\nits superorbital period may subsequently be the result of the\nprecession of a steadily warped disc in which the warp itself\nvaries, due to the competition of warping modes (Clarkson\net al. 2003). Full investigation and further interpretation of\nthese results warrants a far more detailed discussion of the\nsource itself that goes beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n3.1.2\n\nLMC X-4 (Fig.5)\n\nPerhaps the steadiest of the stable superorbital periods in\nall HMXBs, a substantial modulation is strongly detected\nwith a Psup of 30 d. The detection level appears to drop\ntemporarily at MJD\u223c51000, MJD\u223c53000 and finally almost\ndisappears completely around MJD\u223c55500. Since the source\nis clearly detected throughout our observational baseline,\nthe disappearance of the periodic signal toward the end is\nnot due to poor coverage, but more likely an effect intrinsic\nto the source itself.\nLMC X-4 lies in the instability zone on Fig.1, closer to\nthe solid curve. The radiation-induced warps in its accretion\ndisc are therefore expected to be stable and consequently\nable to produce a steady modulation.\n\n3.1.3\n\nHer X-1 (Fig.16)\n\nThis prototypical LMXB has continued to show a very\nstrong detection of a relatively stable Psup \u223c35 d throughout the ASM coverage (and whenever it has been monitored over the last 40 years). The interruptions occurring\naround MJD\u223c51250-51750 and MJD\u223c53000, coincide with\nthe anomalous low states (ALS), of which the first was included and discussed as such in Still et al. (2001). During\nthese states, the maximum flux drops dramatically and becomes comparable to the minimum flux, which also appears\nto be decreasing slightly. Multi-wavelength data suggest that\nthe ALS is not due to \u1e40 being cut off, but is rather caused\nby the shadowing effect of a more extreme tilt in the disc,\nwhich blocks the X-ray emission from the inner regions from\nthe observer (Vrtilek et al. 2001). Leahy & Dupuis (2010)\nsuggest that a larger disc warp may account for the larger\nreduction in extreme UV flux (using Extreme Ultraviolet\nExplorer data) in comparison to that in X-rays (using simultaneous RXTE ASM data) during the ALS.\nHer X-1 lies in the instability zone on Fig.1, approximately halfway between the solid and dashed curves. The\nsuperorbital period is therefore expected to be relatively stable, as a result of the precession of a radiatively warped accretion disc. However, it may show some evolution due to\n\n\fAn Overview of Long-term Variability in X-ray Binaries\nsmall-scale variation in the structure of the warp itself (see\nLeahy & Igna 2010).\n3.1.4\n\nCyg X-2 (Fig.11)\n\nStill showing chaotic and unstable behaviour, the range of\npeaks from \u223c40-90 d in this LMXB are strongly detected\nfrom time to time throughout the RXTE lifetime. An initially weaker (but significant) detection in the range \u223c40-50\nd becomes a much stronger detection toward the end of the\nlight-curve.\nCyg X-2 lies well above the dashed curve on Fig.1, and\nis expected to experience chaotic warping of its accretion\ndisc. As such, it is not expected to have a stable or steadily\nevolving superorbital period, but rather intermittent and\nvariable periods produced by precessing unstable warps. The\nDPS is consistent with intermittent variations.\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nOther HMXBs\nCen X-3 (Fig.2)\n\nThere is a detection of the Psup \u223c140 d around MJD\u223c51500\nfor this HMXB, but it seems to form part of an evolving feature in the DPS, that had its strongest detection at \u223c200\nd at MJD\u223c51000. A variety of shorter term signals (probably linked to the time-scale of the \"on\" states) are strongly\ndetected up to MJD\u223c53500, after which the maximum flux\ndrops dramatically.\nCen X-3 is located in the OD01 instability zone in Fig.1,\nbetween LMC X-4 and SMC X-1. Consequently, Cen X-3 is\nexpected to develop a warped precessing accretion disc in\nwhich the warp itself might be variable (Priedhorsky & Terrell 1983; Iping & Petterson 1990). The behaviour of the\nsuperorbital period is therefore also expected to be somewhere between stable (like LMC X-4) and steadily evolving\n(like SMC X-1). However, our DPS shows the evolution to\nbe erratic, but not chaotic (like Cyg X-2).\n3.2.2\n\nCyg X-1 (Fig.3)\n\nIn this HMXB we detect the very long term Psup of \u223c150\nd and \u223c290 d, which were detected in the Ariel 5 and Vela\n5B datasets respectively (Lachowicz et al. 2006), and the\nsubsequently detected \u223c326 d period in the Swift BAT and\nRXTE ASM data (Rico 2008). In fact, apart from those we\ndetect several other features, many of which appear to be\nstable and are not necessarily harmonics.\nCyg X-1 is located on the OD01 curve associated with\nradd = rc on Fig.1, where we expect stable warps to develop resulting in a steady superorbital period, like that in\nLMC X-4. Zdziarski, Pooley & Skinner (2011) reported the\ndoubling of the Psup and the constant shape of the intrinsic\nspectrum, concluding that those modulations are likely produced by a precessing accretion disc and not changes in \u1e40 .\nThey also confirm the presence of a bulge on the accretion\ndisc edge, as previously proposed.\n3.2.3\n\nLMC X-3 (Fig.4)\n\nFeatures in the DPS of this HMXB are closely linked to\ndetails visible in the lightcurve, since the range of superor-\n\n11\n\nbital periods and the clearly visible lightcurve features are\nall \u223c100-500 d. The periodic signals are therefore rather indicative of time-scales than periodicity (OD01).\nThere is an initial evolution from shorter to longer term\nfeatures, then a change of direction around MJD\u223c51500\nwhich continues past MJD\u223c53000 and then collapses. However, a new long term cycle then starts, evolves more rapidly\nto a shorter term feature during MJD\u223c53000-54500 and also\nappears to collapse, making way for another long term cycle\nstarting at MJD\u223c54700. We see no evidence for a steady\nPsup \u223c99 d as reported in the past (Cowley et al. 1991), but\nrather several steadily evolving long-term features covering\nthe range \u223c 100-500 d, which is the range reported in Wen\nat al. (2006).\nLMC X-3 is located on the OD01 curve using radd = ro\nin Fig.1, below which systems are not expected to develop\nwarped precessing accretion discs. However, OD01 suggest\nthat the long-term variations in this source are due to\nchanges in the mass accretion rate from the donor.\n3.2.4\n\nSS433 (Fig.7)\n\nThe strongest detection for this HMXB is Psup \u223c162\nd, which is the well-known relativistic jet precession period (Margon et al. 1984). This disappears shortly after\nMJD\u223c51000 and reappears at MJD\u223c52000 at a weaker detection strength, remaining until MJD\u223c55000. The weaker\ndetections at the same frequency over the entire baseline and\nthe singular strong detection in the overall L-S, suggest that\na stable X-ray period \u223c162 d is definitely present. The detection thereof may just be hampered from time to time by\nintrinsic fluctuations. A strong detection of a period \u223c400\nd at MJD\u223c51000-52000, when the detection of the \u223c162 d\nperiod effectively disappears, makes a weaker reappearance\nat MJD\u223c53000-54000. During that time it is mirrored (on\nthe opposite side of the \u223c162 d period) by an equally weakly\ndetected \u223c100 d period, which appears to be unstable but\npersists to MJD\u223c55000. Furthermore, upon its reappearance at MJD\u223c51000-52000, the \u223c400 d period appears to\nhave evolved to an even longer period. Since the \u223c400 d period is detected more strongly when the \u223c162 d period is\nweakly detected, this might suggest that the presence of the\nlonger period may have something to do with the weaker\ndetections of the seemingly stable \u223c162 d period.\nSS433 is located in the instability zone on Fig.1 next\nto Her X-1. A stable superorbital period is expected and\nis very clearly present in its optical and radio behaviour.\nThe relativistic jets as inferred from their optical emission\ncomponents, have been stable on the 162 d period for > 30\nyrs (Blundell & Bowler 2005). We note that SS433 is in a\nvery different evolutionary state at present compared to any\nother XRB considered here, with its high q value leading to\nextreme super-Eddington accretion onto the BH (Begelman,\nKing & Pringle 2006).\n3.2.5\n\nX0114+650 (Fig.8)\n\nIn this HMXB, the Psup \u223c31 d is weakly detected from\nMJD\u223c50500 in the DPS. It is strongly detected in the overall L-S periodogram and from MJD\u223c50700-51400 in the\nDPS. Thereafter it remains relatively stable with alternating\nstronger and weaker detections of this signal.\n\n\f12\n\nM.M. Kotze & P.A. Charles\n\nAlthough it is not as strongly detected as those of LMC\nX-4 or Her X-1, it appears relatively steady and persistent.\nThe location of X0114+650 on Fig.1 is not known, but as\nan HMXB with Porb \u223c 11.6 d (Liu, van Paradijs & van den\nHeuvel 2006) it is likely to be above the OD01 curve for\nradd = ro , and stable superorbital periods associated with\na stable precessing warped accretion disc are therefore not\nunexpected. Moreover, since X0114+650 is a BeX (Koenigsberger et al. 1983), we could also expect superorbital variations due to a modulation in \u1e40 as the equatorial disc of the\nBe-star expands and contracts (see Rajoelimanana, Charles\n& Udalski 2011).\n3.2.6\n\nX1907+097 (Fig.9)\n\nWe do not find evidence for the claimed (OD01) Psup \u223c42\nd (or any other) X-ray superorbital period in this HMXB.\nX1907+097 is located above the dashed curve on Fig.1 where\nwe expect chaotic warping to occur, but OD01 suggested\nthat it may lack superorbital variations as a result of its\neccentric orbit (Bildsten et al. 1997).\n3.2.7\n\nXTE J1716-389 (Fig.10)\n\nXTE J1716-389 is a quasi-persistent HMXB. An initial detection of the Psup \u223c99 d, becomes progressively weaker and\nis only visible in the DPS until MJD\u223c53000, when there is\na dramatic drop in the lightcurve to the low state.\nThe relatively regular, weaker detections of the \u223c99 d\nperiod while the source is persistent, do seem to suggest\nthat it exhibits a relatively steady superorbital period. The\nlocation of XTE J1716-389 on Fig.1 is not known, but as an\nHMXB it is expected to be at least above the OD01 curve for\nradd = ro . As such, a stable superorbital period associated\nwith a steadily precessing warp while it is persistent, is also\nnot unexpected.\n\n3.3\n3.3.1\n\nOther LMXBs\nEXO 0748-676 (Fig.12)\n\nA Psup of 181 d was detected during the high state in\nthis quasi-persistent LMXB and was clearly not stable, but\nshows steady evolution. The DPS shows several significant\ndetected signals during the portions of the higher state\nwhere the previously published superorbital periods were\nnoted (Kotze, Charles & Crause 2009) and there is no evidence for any periodic signals in the low state.\nEXO 0748-676 has an unknown location on Fig.1. However, it has Porb \u223c3.8 hours (Liu, van Paradijs & van den\nHeuvel 2007) and q \u223c0.11-0.28 (Mu\u00f1oz-Darias et al. 2009),\nimplying M2 <0.42. As a LMXB with Porb <1 day, we would\nnot expect it to produce a steadily precessing warped accretion disc, but with a q <0.25-0.33, tidal disc precession is a\nserious possibility.\n3.3.2\n\nappears to continue through an interval with lower amplitude variations (significantly weaker detections around\nMJD\u223c52500-53500), to re-emerge thereafter.\nThere is also a significant detection at \u223c70 d, which\nappears to be related to (but not simply the harmonic of)\nthe periodic behaviour around \u223c147 d. The two periodic\nsignals at \u223c70 and \u223c147 d both appear to evolve overall\ntoward slightly longer periods.\nThe location of GRS 1747-312 on Fig.1 is not known,\nbut as a LMXB with Porb \u223c12.36 hours (Liu, van Paradijs\n& van den Heuvel 2007) it is likely situated below the OD01\ncurve for radd = ro , below which sources are not expected to\ndevelop warped precessing discs or display the steady Psup\nassociated therewith.\n\nGRS 1747-312 (Fig.13)\n\nThe Psup \u223c147 d of this LMXB is strongly detected in the\nL-S periodogram and DPS at MJD\u223c50500 & MJD\u223c52000.\nHowever, this periodic signal shows clear variation that\n\n3.3.3\n\nGX 339-4 (Fig.14)\n\nThe Psup \u223c190-250 d in this transient-like BH-LMXB are\ndetected in the lightcurve after removing the outbursts (the\nplot included herein) as well as when the outbursts are included. GX 339-4 is located below the curve for radd = ro on\nFig.1 and is not expected to develop a warped precessing disc\nand variations are likely due to modulations in \u1e40 (OD01).\nHowever, the q \u223c0.7 used in OD01 was a rough estimate\nand it has since been determined to be q <0.08 (Hynes et\nal. 2003), making tidal disc precession likely. Furthermore,\nHynes et al. (2003) find Porb \u223c1.755 d and MX \u223c5M\u2299 .\nrb\nRecalculation using the OD01 method gives 10\n6 \u223c1 in comparison with \u223c0.6 in OD01, moving GX 339-4 into the intermediate instability zone.\n3.3.4\n\nGX 354-0 (Fig.15)\n\nThe DPS shows a Psup \u223c63 & \u223c72 d are both initially detected, and rapidly replaced by a single period between those\nvalues. The strongest detections are towards the end of the\ndataset where a \u223c50 d period evolves toward \u223c70 d. The\nsource also clearly displays very long-term variability on a\n\u223cdecade long time-scale (\u00d6zdemir 2010, Kotze & Charles\n2010), which are not believed to be associated with the accretion disc properties.\nWe find no evidence for a stable superorbital period, nor\nfor prolonged steady evolution. The behaviour rather resembles the chaotic warping observed in Cyg X-2. Its location\non Fig.1 is unknown.\n3.3.5\n\nIGR J17098-3628 (Fig.17)\n\nA Psup of 163 d was detected during the higher state in this\nquasi-persistent LMXB. It is clearly not stable and shows\nsteady evolution with several significant detected signals\nin the DPS during the portions of the higher state where\nthe previously published superorbital periods were noted\n(Kotze, Charles & Crause 2009). There is no evidence for\nperiodic signals in the low state.\nIGR J17098-3628 has an unknown location on Fig.1, but\nin Kotze, Charles & Crause (2009) we argued that, based on\nthe apparent similarities with EXO 0748-676, IGR J170983628 likely also has Porb <1 d. As a LMXB with Porb <1\nday, IGR J17098-3628 would not be expected to produce\nsteadily precessing warped accretion discs (OD01).\n\n\fAn Overview of Long-term Variability in X-ray Binaries\n3.3.6\n\nKS 1731-260 (Fig.18)\n\nThe Psup \u223c38 d of this quasi-persistent LMXB is detected\nduring the high state (MJD<51000) and during the transition from the high state to the low state (MJD\u223c5100052000). However, the strongest detection is a period that\nevolves from \u223c70 d to \u223c45 d during that transition. So\nthere appears to be two sections to the high state which\ncould be considered separately, namely MJD<51000 and\nMJD\u223c51000-52000. The \u223c38 d superorbital period appears\nin both of those, suggesting some measure of stability.\nAlthough KS 1731-260 does not appear to be stable\nlike Her X-1 when it is persistent, its behaviour is not quite\ncomparable to the chaotic warping behaviour observed in\nCyg X-2. KS 1731-260's location on Fig.1 is unknown, but\nas an LMXB it is likely located below the OD01 curve for\nradd = ro and therefore unlikely to produce a warped accretion disc.\n3.3.7\n\nLMC X-2 & MS 1603.6+2600 (Fig.19 & 20)\n\nThe DPS results for these LMXBs show no evidence for\nany significant long-term X-ray periodicities, particularly\nexcluding the previously suggested Psup \u223c8 d and \u223c5 d for\nLMC X-2 & MS 1603.6+2600 respectively (Charles et al.\n2008). All points in their L-S periodograms are below the\nwhite noise level and their DPS plots show no periodic features that are persistent in any way. We note that periods\nin the same range are very clearly detected for several other\nsources using similar data.\nThe behaviour for LMC X-2 and MS 1603.6+2600 is\nnot even reminiscent of Cyg X-2, where there are significant,\nbut chaotic signals that are persistent and strongly detected.\nThe results for these two sources appear to represent only\nnoise.\nLocations for both these sources are unknown on Fig.1.\nMS 1603.6+2600 has Porb \u223c1.85 hours and LMC X-2 has\nPorb \u223c8.16 hours (Liu, van Paradijs & van den Heuvel 2007)\nand as LMXBs with Porb <1 d, they are not expected to produce warped accretion discs (OD01). However, with q \u223c0.14\nfor LMC X-2 (Cornelisse et al. 2007), tidal disc precession\nis likely. MS 1603.6+2600 a.k.a. UW CrB, has a short Porb\nand likely shares properties with the other short period systems, such as having a q <0.25, making tidal disc precession\nlikely.\n3.3.8\n\nSco X-1 (Fig.21)\n\nThe previously reported Psup was incorrectly quoted as \u223c62\nd in OD01, instead of \u223c62 hrs (Kudryavtsev et al. 1989).\nNeither of these are significantly detected here. However,\nlonger term periods \u223c200 d are strongly detected and appear\nto recur after essentially disappearing from MJD\u223c5100052000.\nSco X-1 is located in the OD01 intermediate instability\nzone on Fig.1, where discs are expected to alternate between\nbeing warped and flat. However, the q \u223c0.7 used in OD01\nwas only an estimate, and it has since been determined to be\nq \u223c0.3 (Steeghs & Casares 2002), making tidal disc precession also likely. Recalculation using the OD01 method gives\nrb\n\u223c1.5, meaning Sco X-1 remains in the intermediate in106\nstability zone.\n\n3.3.9\n\n13\n\nX1636-536 (Fig.22)\n\nThe Psup \u223c46 d superorbital period of this quasi-persistent\nLMXB shows similar behaviour to that of KS 1731-260 in\nthat it is strongly detected at MJD\u223c53000-54000 when the\nsource has made a transition to a lower state (Shih et al.\n2005). It does not appear to be stable during either state, but\nappears persistent and steadily evolving during the first half\nof the low state. The second part of the low state contains\ndetections of shorter periods.\nThe location of X1636-536 on Fig.1 makes formation\nof a warped precessing disc unlikely since it is below the\nradd = ro curve. Warps are also expected to form during the\npersistent states of quasi-persistent X-ray binaries, but here\nthe periodic signals are stronger during the low state. The\nquasi-periodic superorbital period detected in X1636-536 is\nbelieved to be a result of X-ray state changes, characterized\nby the anti-correlation between hard and soft X-rays (Shih\net al. 2005). The optical and soft X-rays have been found\nto be correlated, as the latter is reprocessed in the accretion\ndisc (Shih et al. 2011).\n\n3.3.10\n\nX1730-333 (Fig.23)\n\nThis prototypical LMXB (it is the Rapid Burster in the\nglobular cluster Liller 1 (Apparao & Chitre 1979)) shows an\ninitially strong detection of the Psup \u223c217 d, which appears\nto remain steady up to MJD\u223c51500. However, during that\ntime there are a number of shorter term periods, that do not\nappear to simply be harmonics. A period of mostly \u223c100 d\nis strongly detected and steadily drifting until MJD\u223c52500,\nwhen a marked evolution from shorter to longer periods begins.\nThe superorbital periods in X1730-333 show evolution\nbut are not steadily evolving (in the SMC X-1 sense), neither\nare they unstable (in the Cyg X-2 sense). It rather appears\nto be a variety of steadily evolving periods, which initially\nappear to have some connection with each other. They may\nbe indicative of the time-scale on which bursts recur, rather\nthan periodicities. The location of X1730-333 on Fig.1 is\nunknown.\n\n3.3.11\n\nX1820-303 (Fig.24)\n\nThe Psup \u223c172 d in this LMXB is strongly detected and\nappears stable. Its detection is weaker during MJD\u223c5120052200 (but still significant) and simultaneously there are\ndetections of shorter term periods during that time. The\n\u223c86 d period is the first harmonic thereof, but the \u223c65 d\nperiod is not a harmonic.\nThe location of X1820-303 on Fig.1, makes it highly\nunlikely that any superorbital period in the system would be\nrelated to a precessing warped accretion disc. However, since\nit has been interpreted as a triple system (Chou & Grindlay,\n2001), the period would rather be connected with the \u1e40\nvariations resulting from the effects of the third body and\nis therefore expected to be (extremely) stable. The minor\nvariations visible in the DPS for the Psup \u223c172 d are within\nconservative error estimates for the periods determined in\neach window, and are therefore not significant.\n\n\fM.M.

Steady refers\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThis DPS overview aims to provide the long awaited timeresolved analysis that OD01 suggested would be required for\naperiodic sources, as a basis for future investigations. An indepth analysis of each source and detailed discussion of the\nfull implications of these results, goes beyond the scope of\nthis work. Here we wish to highlight whether the results from\nour DPS analysis suggest steady, evolving, persistent or unstable periods, and how they relate to previously published\nperiods.\nDuring the discussion of each source, we first compared\nthe observed behaviour apparent from our analysis with\nthe OD01 predictions for stability of accretion discs against\nradiation-driven warping, since the OD01 process has a dependence on system parameters (determining an XRB's location on Fig.1) which allows its feasibility for superorbital\nvarying systems as a class to be assessed. Sources for which\nother mechanisms can account for the Psup , were also compared to those predictions, where applicable. Such mechanisms include tidal disc precession, precessing relativistic\njets and \u1e40 variations due to a third body, state changes or\nvariations in the size of the equatorial disc surrounding a Be\nstar donor.\n\n\fAn Overview of Long-term Variability in X-ray Binaries\n4.1\n\nWarped/Tilted Accretion Discs\n\nOD01 predicted that only a small fraction of X-ray binaries\nshould display steady superorbital periods associated with\nstable, steadily precessing, radiation-driven warped accretion discs. Furthermore, they suggested that it would be\neven less common in LMXBs, since only those with Porb >1\nd are expected to produce warps. However, 16 of the 25\nsources contained herein are LMXBs. With 114 HMXBs and\n187 LMXBs contained in the catalogues of Liu, van Paradijs\n& van den Heuvel (2006, 2007), it implies that superorbital\nperiods have been detected in a slightly larger fraction of\nLMXBs than HMXBs.\nHowever, recent Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics\n(SPH) simulations by Foulkes, Haswell & Murray (2010)\non SMC X-1, Cyg X-1, Cyg X-2, X1916-053, LMC X-3,\nHer X-1, SS433 and a generalized LMXB, produced warps\nover all orbital periods considered. Contrary to OD01, they\npredict that superorbital periods should be very common\nin LMXBs, suggesting that the analytical OD01 approach\nis necessarily approximate and that the SPH simulations\nshould incorporate the complexities involved in an irradiated accretion disc more accurately as their \"disc continuously flexes in response to the changing orientation of the\nRoche potential\".\nIt is important to remember that the OD01 predictions\nfor stability of accretion discs against radiation-driven warping, are for specific \u03b1 and \u01eb values and that the instability\ncriteria depend largely on \u03b1 and to a slightly lesser extent\non \u01eb, making the predictions approximate. Different \u03b1 and \u01eb\nvalues would yield very different predictions and these values\nare expected to differ from system to system. Other mechanisms, such as wind-driven tilting and magnetic warping,\nmay also produce warped/tilted accretions discs.\nFurthermore, warps need to be sustained for prolonged\nintervals to produce steady superorbital periods (as in Her\nX-1 & LMC X-4). Lodato & Price (2010) used SPH simulations to consider the diffuse propagation of warps in viscous\nthin discs, where they determined the diffusion coefficient to\nbe \u223c 1/\u03b1 (for small amplitude warps and \u03b1 <0.1), in general finding that higher viscosity leads to slower diffusion\nand lower viscosity to more rapid diffusion.\nOf the 25 X-ray binaries considered here, 15 could be\ndirectly compared to their OD01 predictions. The results are\ngenerally consistent with their predictions.\nFirstly, our results support the OD01 prediction that\nLMXBs are unlikely to produce stable precessing warped\ndiscs, since they are mostly located below the radd = ro line\nand their accretion disks are therefore too small to become\nunstable against warping in the expected radiation field. Her\nX-1 remains the only LMXB to have a steady superorbital\nperiod that can be associated with its accretion disc, since\nX1820-303 is likely a triple system. Her X-1 is not a typical LMXB, since it has higher donor mass than most other\nLMXBs and therefore it might share some HMXB properties\nor be an Intermediate-Mass X-ray Binary (IMXB; see Podsiadlowski, Rappaport & Han 2003). One of these properties\nappears to be its ability to produce a warped precessing disc,\nwith its associated steady superorbital period.\nSecondly, OD01 predictions implied that HMXBs are\nmore likely to produce stable warped precessing discs, although eccentric orbits would suppresses stable radiation-\n\n15\n\ndriven warping. Our DPS analysis has shown that not only\nLMC X-4 displays a stable superorbital period, but also Cyg\nX-1, SS433, X0114+650 & XTE J1716-389. Only the locations of the latter two sources on Fig.1 are unknown. Cyg\nX-1, LMC X-4 & SS433 are located in the OD01 instability\nzone and therefore expected to have warped precessing accretion discs that produce steady superorbital periods while\nthey are persistent. However, the steady superorbital periods\nin SS433 and X0114+650 may have other origins, since the\nformer experiences relativistic jet precession and the latter\nis a BeX.\nThirdly, we included 5 quasi-persistent sources for\nwhich superorbital periods have been published. Four of\nthese are LMXBs (X1636-536, KS 1731-260, EXO 0748-676\n& IGR J17098-3628) and XTE J1716-389 is the only HMXB.\nAs OD01 predicted, these quasi-persistent sources produce\nsuperorbital periods during their persistent (high) states,\nwith the exception of X1636-536, where stronger detections\noccurred during the lower state. Its low state is certainly not\nan off state where the flux goes to zero, as seen in the other\nfour sources. It also displayed an anti-correlation between\nhard and soft X-ray components (Shih et al. 2005). Furthermore, only the HMXBs produced a relatively steady superorbital period while the LMXBs all produced multiple periodic signals that were either evolving or unstable/chaotic.\nFinally, OD01 predicted that Sco X-1 would be\nmarginally unstable or stable and show variability, since it\nis located in the intermediate instability zone. Our results\nshow long-term behaviour that may be interpreted in this\nmanner.\nClarkson et al. (2003) suggested that warps may manifest themselves as modulations in the X-ray flux, not only\nresulting from variations in the accretion disc structure but\nalso by modulation of \u1e40 . Varying absorption of X-rays from\nthe central source by a warped inner disc or the variation\nin the uncovered X-ray emitting area apply to the former,\nwhile variation of the accretion rate onto the compact object\nor modulation of the mass flow rate through the disc (Dubus\n2003) apply to the latter. It was also suggested that competing radiation-driven warping modes may cause variations in\nthe warp itself, resulting in the steady evolution/variation of\nthe Psup in SMC X-1, consistent with its OD01 prediction.\nHer X-1, with Psup \u223c33-37 d (Leahy & Igna 2010) might be\nsubject to the same effect, to a lesser extent.\n4.2\n\nComplex \u1e40 variations\n\nMany of the superorbital periods already detected may be\nthe result of the modulation of the \u1e40 , rather than only being associated with warped precessing accretion discs. Many\nmay therefore also indicate the time-scale on which transitions occur between high and low flux states. The HMXBs\nCen X-3, Cyg X-1 & LMC X-3 and the LMXB X1957+115\nhave very similar lightcurves that clearly show these transitions on varying time-scales. However, in the case of Cyg\nX-1 there is also evidence for a precessing warped accretion\ndisc (Zdziarski, Pooley & Skinner 2011).\nIn fact, the majority of the superorbital periods are\nclearly not steady, with many of those showing unsteady\nevolution of multiple periodic signals while they are persistent. Such behaviour may also be associated with a variety\nof time-scales produced by \u1e40 variations.\n\n\f16\n4.3\n\nM.M. Kotze & P.A. Charles\nThe strength of time-dependent analysis\n\nOur results emphasize the importance of using a timedependent periodic analysis approach such as DPS when\ninvestigating the long-term periods that have been associated with accretion disc properties such as precession/warping/tilting and \u1e40 variations due to X-ray state\nchanges. Traditional period analysis, which use the entire\ndatasets at one's disposal, would miss a source like KS 1731260 since its overall periodogram shows no significant peaks.\nMoreover, all the variations and complex behaviour of quasiperiodic signals go completely unnoticed. For example, the\nlightcurves of LMXBs X1730-333 & GRS 1747-312 show\nsome similarity to Her X-1, but their superorbital periods\nare not steady and appear to be evolving or varying.\nConsequently it is not unexpected that studies of superorbital behaviour in hard X-rays (14-195 keV) using data\nfrom the Swift Burst Alert Telescope and soft X-rays (1.5-12\nkeV) using RXTE ASM data, found no significant periodic\nmodulations for X1916-053, Cyg X-2 & Sco X-1, while being\nable to confirm the previously reported periods in X1820303 & X1636-536 (Farrell, Barret & Skinner 2009). Unstable\nand/or intermittent periodic signals may lie below the white\nand/or red noise level when considering the longer datasets,\nwhile the time-dependent DPS analysis shows intermittent\nand sustained periodic signals that appear to vary over time.\nSince we are no longer limited by desktop technology,\napplying this analysis method to the other XRB sources\ncontained in the RXTE ASM is relatively straightforward.\nIt may reveal complex periodic behaviour that has thus far\ngone unnoticed.\n\n5\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nASM results were provided by the ASM/RXTE teams at\nMIT and at the RXTE Science Operations Facility and\nGuest Observer Facility at NASA's Goddard Space Flight\nCenter (GSFC).
