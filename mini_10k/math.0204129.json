The present paper improves a result of [3] by showing that\na space X is topologically well-orderable if and only if there exists a\nselection for F2 (X) which is continuous with respect to the Fell topology\non F2 (X). In particular, this implies that F(X) has a Fell-continuous\nselection if and only if F2 (X) has a Fell-continuous selection.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet X be a topological space, and let F(X) be the family of all non-empty\nclosed subsets of X. Also, let \u03c4 be a topology on F(X) and D \u2282 F(X). A\nmap f : D \u2192 X is a selection for D if f (S) \u2208 S for every S \u2208 D. A map\nf : D \u2192 X is a \u03c4 -continuous selection for D if it is a selection for D which\nis continuous with respect to the relative topology \u03c4 on D as a subspace of\nF(X).\nTwo topologies on F(X) will play the most important role in this paper.\nThe first one is the Vietoris topology \u03c4V which is generated by all collections\nof the form\nn\n[ o\nhVi = S \u2208 F(X) : S \u2229 V 6= \u2205, V \u2208 V, and S \u2282\nV ,\nwhere V runs over the finite families of open subsets of X. The other one\nis the Fell topology \u03c4F which is defined\nby all basic Vietoris neighbourhood\nS\nhVi with the property that X \\ V is compact.\nFinally, let us recall that a space X is topologically well-orderable (see\nEngelking, Heath and Michael [2]) if there exists a linear order \"\u227a\" on X\nsuch that X is a linear ordered topological space with respect to \u227a, and\nevery non-empty closed subset of X has a \u227a-minimal element.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Hyperspace topology, selection, ordered space, local\ncompactness.\nValentin Gutev, Fell-continuous selections and topologically well-orderable spaces II,\nProceedings of the Ninth Prague Topological Symposium, (Prague, 2001), pp. 147\u2013153,\nTopology Atlas, Toronto, 2002.\n147\n\n\f148\n\nVALENTIN GUTEV\n\nRecently, the topologically well-orderable spaces were characterized in [3,\nTheorem 1.3] by means of Fell-continuous selections for their hyperspaces of\nnon-empty closed subsets.\nTheorem 1.1 ([3]). A Hausdorff space X is topologically well-orderable if\nand only if F(X) has a \u03c4F -continuous selection.\nIn the present paper, we improve Theorem 1.1 by showing that one may\nuse \u03c4F -continuous selections only for the subset F2 (X) = {S \u2208 F(X) : |S| \u2264\n2} of F(X). Namely, the following theorem will be proven.\nTheorem 1.2. A Hausdorff space X is topologically well-orderable if and\nonly if F2 (X) has a \u03c4F -continuous selection.\nAbout related results for Vietoris-continuous selections, the interested\nreader is referred to van Mill and Wattel [6].\nTheorem 1.2 is interesting also from another point of view. According to\nTheorem 1.1, it implies the following result which may have an independent\ninterest.\nCorollary 1.3. If X is a Hausdorff space, then F(X) has a \u03c4F -continuous\nselection if and only if F2 (X) has a \u03c4F -continuous selection.\nA word should be said also about the proof of Theorem 1.2. In general,\nit is based on the proof of Theorem 1.1 stated in [3], and is separated in\na few different steps which are natural generalizations of the corresponding\nones given in [3]. In fact, the paper demonstrates that all statements of [3]\nremain true if F(X) is replaced by F2 (X). Related to this, the interested\nreader may consult an alternative proof of Theorem 1.2 given in [1] and\nbased again on the scheme in [3].\n2. A reduction to locally compact spaces\nIn the sequel, all spaces are assumed to be at least Hausdorff.\nIn this section, we prove the following generalization of [3, Theorem 2.1].\nTheorem 2.1. Let X be a space such that F2 (X) has a \u03c4F -continuous\nselection. Then X is locally compact.\nProof. We follow the proof of [3, Theorem 2.1]. Namely, let f be a \u03c4F continuous selection for F2 (X) and suppose, if possible, that X is not locally\ncompact. Hence, there exists a point p \u2208 X such that V is not compact for\nevery neighbourhood V of p in X. Claim that there exists a point q \u2208 X\nsuch that\n(1)\n\nq 6= p and f ({p, q}) = p.\n\nTo this purpose, note that there exists F \u2208 F(X) such that F is not compact\nand p \u2208\n/ F . Then, f \u22121 (X \\ F ) is a \u03c4F -neighbourhood of {p} in F2 (X), so\n\n\fFELL-CONTINUOUS SELECTIONS\n\nthere exists a finite family W of open subsets of X such that X \\\ncompact and\n\n149\n\nS\n\nW is\n\n{p} \u2208 hWi \u2229 F2 (X) \u2282 f \u22121 (X \\ F ).\nThen, F \u2229 W 6= \u2205 for some W\nS \u2208 W because F is not compact. Therefore,\nthere exists a point q \u2208 F \u2229 ( W). This q is as required.\nLet q be as in (1). Since X is Hausdorff, f ({q}) 6= f ({p, q}), and f is\n\u03c4F -continuous, there\nS now exist two finite families U and V of open subsets of\nX such that X \\ U is compact, {q} \u2208 hU i, {p, q} \u2208 hVi, and hU i \u2229 hVi = \u2205.\nThen,\n\\\n[\n(2)\np \u2208 Vp = {V \u2208 V : p \u2208 V } \u2282 X \\\nU.\nS\nIndeed, suppose there is a point l \u2208 Vp \u2229 ( U ). Then, {l, q} \u2208 hU i because\n{q} \u2208 hU i. However, we also get that {l, q} \u2208 hVi because q \u2208\n/ V for\nsome V \u2208 V implies p \u2208 V , hence l \u2208 Vp \u2282 V . Thus, we finally get that\n{l, q} \u2208 hU i \u2229 hVi which is impossible. So, (2) holds as well.\nTo finish the proof, it remains to observe that this contradicts the choice\nof p. Namely Vp becomes\nS a neighbourhood of p which, by (2), has a compact\nclosure because X \\ U is compact.\n\u0003\n3. A reduction to compact spaces\nFor a locally compact space X we will use \u03b1X to denote the one point\ncompactification of X. For a non-compact locally compact X let us agree\nto denote by \u03b1 the point of the singleton \u03b1X \\ X.\nIn what follows, to every family D \u2282 F(X) we associate a family \u03b1(D) \u2282\nF(\u03b1X) defined by\n\u03b1(D) = {S \u2208 F(\u03b1X) : S \u2229 X \u2208 D \u222a {\u2205}}.\nThe following extension theorem was actually proven in [3, Theorem 3.1].\nTheorem 3.1. Let X be a locally compact non-compact space X, and D \u2282\nF(X). Then, D has a \u03c4F -continuous selection if and only if \u03b1(D) has a\n\u03c4V -continuous selection g such that g \u22121 (\u03b1) = {{\u03b1}}.\nProof. Just the same proof as in [3, Theorem 3.1] works. Namely, if f is a\n\u03c4F -continuous selection for D, we may define a selection g for \u03b1(D) by g(S) =\nf (S \u2229 X) if S \u2229 X 6= \u2205 and g(S) = \u03b1 otherwise, where S \u2208 \u03b1(D). Clearly\ng\u22121 (\u03b1) = {{\u03b1}} and, as shown in [3, Theorem 3.1], g is \u03c4V -continuous. If\nnow g is a \u03c4V -continuous selection for \u03b1(D), with g\u22121 (\u03b1) = {{\u03b1}}, then\ng(S \u222a {\u03b1}) \u2208 S for every S \u2208 D, so we may define a selection f for D by\nf (S) = g (S \u222a {\u03b1}), S \u2208 D. The verification that f is \u03c4F -continuous was\ndone in [3, Theorem 3.1].\n\u0003\n\n\f150\n\nVALENTIN GUTEV\n\n4. Special selections and connected sets\nIn what follows, to every selection f : F2 (X) \u2192 X we associate an orderlike relation \"\u227af \" on X (see Michael [5]) defined for x 6= y by\nx1 \u227af x2 iff f ({x1 , x2 }) = x1 .\nFurther, we will need also the following \u227af -intervals:\n(x, +\u221e)\u227af = {z \u2208 X : x \u227af z}\nand\n[x, +\u221e)\u227af = {z \u2208 X : x \u0016f z}.\nNow, we provide the generalization of [3, Theorem 4.1] for the case of F2 (X).\nTheorem 4.1. Let X be a space, a \u2208 X, and let A \u2208 F(X) be a connected\nset such that |A| > 1 and a \u2208 A \u2229 X \\ A. Also, let f : F2 (X) \u2192 X be a\n\u03c4V -continuous selection for F2 (X). Then, f \u22121 (a) 6= {{a}}.\nProof. Suppose, on the contrary, that f \u22121 (a) = {{a}}. By hypothesis, there\nexists a point b \u2208 A, with b 6= a. Since f is \u03c4V -continuous, f ({a, b}) = b and\na \u2208 X \\ A, we can find a point c \u2208 X \\ A such that f ({b, c}) = b. Then,\nB = A \u2229 (c, +\u221e)\u227af is a clopen subset of A because B = A \u2229 [c, +\u221e)\u227af , see\n[5]. However, this is impossible because b \u2208 A \\ B, while a \u2208 B.\n\u0003\n5. A further result about special selections\nFollowing [3], we shall say that a point a \u2208 X is a partition of X if there\nare open subset L, R \u2282 X \\ {a} such that L \u2229 R = {a} and L \u2229 R = \u2205.\nWe finalize the preparation for the proof of Theorem 1.2 with the following result about special Vietoris continuous selections and partitions which\ngeneralizes [3, Theorem 5.1].\nTheorem 5.1. Let X be a compact space, f a \u03c4V -continuous selection for\nF2 (X), and let a \u2208 X be a partition of X such that f \u22121 (a) = {{a}}. Then,\nX is first countable at a.\nProof. By definition, there are open sets L, R \u2282 X \\ {a} such that L \u2229 R =\n{a} and L \u2229 R = \u2205. Hence, both L and R are non-empty. Take a point\nl0 \u2208 L. Then, by hypothesis, f ({l0 , a}) = l0 . Since f is \u03c4V -continuous, this\nimplies the existence of a neighbourhood L0 \u2282 L of l0 and a neighbourhood\nV0 of a such that\nL0 \u2229 V0 = \u2205 and f (h{L0 , V0 }i \u2229 F2 (X)) \u2282 L0 .\nSince a \u2208 R, there exists a point r0 \u2208 V0 \u2229 R. Observe that f ({a, r0 }) =\nr0 \u2208 V0 . Hence, just like before, we may find a neighbourhood R0 \u2282 R \u2229 V0\nof r0 and a neighbourhood W0 \u2282 V0 of a such that\nR0 \u2229 W0 = \u2205 and f (h{R0 , W0 }i \u2229 F2 (X)) \u2282 R0 .\n\n\fFELL-CONTINUOUS SELECTIONS\n\n151\n\nThus, by induction, we may construct a sequence {ln : n < \u03c9} of points of\nL, a sequence {rn : n < \u03c9} of points of R, and open sets Ln , Vn , Rn , Wn \u2282 X\nsuch that\nln \u2208 Ln ,\na \u2208 Vn ,\n(3)\nLn \u2229 Vn = \u2205 and\nf (h{Ln , Vn }i \u2229 F2 (X)) \u2282 Ln ,\n\n(4)\n\nrn \u2208 Rn ,\na \u2208 Wn ,\nRn \u2229 Wn = \u2205 and\nf (h{Rn , Wn }i \u2229 F2 (X)) \u2282 Rn ,\n\nand\n(5)\n\nVn+1 \u2282 Wn \u2282 Vn ,\nLn+1 \u2282 L \u2229 Wn and\nRn \u2282 R \u2229 V n .\n\nSince X is compact, {ln : n < \u03c9} has a cluster point l, and {rn : n < \u03c9}\nhas a cluster point r. We claim that l = r. Indeed, suppose for instance\nthat l \u227af r (the case r \u227af l is symmetric). Then, there are disjoint open\nsets Ul and Ur such that l \u2208 Ul , r \u2208 Ur , and x \u227af y for every x \u2208 Ul\nand y \u2208 Ur , see [4]. Next, take ln \u2208 Ul and rm \u2208 Ur such that n >\nm. Then, we have ln \u227af rm . However, by (3), (4) and (5), we get that\n{rm , ln } \u2208 h{Rm , Wm }i \u2229 F2 (X), and therefore f ({rm , ln }) = rm . This is\nclearly impossible, so l = r.\nHaving already established this, let us observe that b = l = r implies\nb \u2208 L \u2229 R because l \u2208 L and r \u2208 R. However, L \u2229 R = {a} which finally\nimplies that b = a.\nWe are now ready to prove that, for instance, {Wn : n < \u03c9} is a local\nbase at a. To this end, suppose if possible that this fails. Hence, there\nexists an open neighbourhood U of a such that Wn \\ U 6= \u2205 for every n < \u03c9.\nNext, whenever n < \u03c9, take a point tn \u2208 Wn \\ U . Since X is compact,\n{tn : n < \u03c9} has a cluster point t 6\u2208 U . Then, t \u227af a and, as before,\nwe may find disjoint open sets Ut and Ua such that t \u2208 Ut , a \u2208 Ua , and\nx \u227af y for every x \u2208 Ut and y \u2208 Ua . Next, take tn \u2208 Ut and rm \u2208 Ua\nsuch that n > m. Then, tn \u227af rm , while, by (4) and (5), rm \u227af tn because\n{rm , tn } \u2208 h{Rm , Wm }i \u2229 F2 (X). The contradiction so obtained completes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\n6. Proof of Theorem 1.2\nIn case X is a topologically well-orderable space, we may use Theorem\n1.1.\nSuppose that F2 (X) has a \u03c4F -continuous selection. If X is compact, then\nTheorem 1.2 is, in fact, a result of van Mill and Wattel [6]. Let X be noncompact. By Theorem 2.1, X is locally compact. Then, by Theorem 3.1,\n\n\f152\n\nVALENTIN GUTEV\n\nF2 (\u03b1X) has a \u03c4V -continuous selection f such that f \u22121 (\u03b1) = {{\u03b1}}. Relying\nonce again on the result of [6], \u03b1X is a linear ordered topological space with\nrespect to some linear order \"<\" on \u03b1X. It now suffices to show that there\nexists a compatible (with the topology of \u03b1X) linear order \"\u227a\" on \u03b1X such\nthat \u03b1 is either the first or the last element of \u03b1X, see [2, Lemma 4.1]. We\nshow this following precisely the proof of Theorem 1.1 in [3]. Namely, let\nL = {x \u2208 \u03b1X : x < \u03b1} and R = {x \u2208 \u03b1X : \u03b1 < x}.\nNote that L, R \u2282 \u03b1X \\ {\u03b1} = X are open subsets of \u03b1X. In case one of\nthese sets is also closed, the desired linear order \"\u227a\" on \u03b1X can be defined\nby exchanging the places of L and R. Namely, by letting for x, y \u2208 \u03b1X that\nx \u227a y if and only if\nx, y \u2208 L and x < y, or\nx, y \u2208 R and x < y, or\nx \u2208 R and y \u2208 L.\nFinally, let us consider the case L \u2229 R = {\u03b1}. Then, \u03b1 is a partition of\n\u03b1X. Hence, by Theorem 5.1, \u03b1X is first countable at \u03b1. Let C[\u03b1] be the\nconnected component of \u03b1 in \u03b1X. Since f \u22121 (\u03b1) = {{\u03b1}}, it now follows\nfrom Theorem 4.1 that C[\u03b1] = {\u03b1}. Indeed, C \u2032 = C[\u03b1] \u2229 {x \u2208 \u03b1X : x \u2264 \u03b1}\nand C \u2032\u2032 = C[\u03b1] \u2229 {x \u2208 \u03b1X : x \u2265 \u03b1} are both connected subsets of X with\n\u03b1 \u2208 C \u2032 \u2229 (X \\ C \u2032 ) and \u03b1 \u2208 C \u2032\u2032 \u2229 (X \\ C \u2032\u2032 ) (consider that X \\ C \u2032 \u2283 R and\nX \\ C \u2032\u2032 \u2283 L), so that C \u2032 = {\u03b1} and C \u2032\u2032 = {\u03b1}, whence also C[\u03b1] = {\u03b1}.\nThen, \u03b1X has a clopen base at \u03b1. Indeed, let l \u2208 L and r \u2208 R. Since C[\u03b1]\nis also the quasi-component of the point \u03b1, there are clopen neighbourhoods\nUl , Ur of \u03b1 such that l 6\u2208 Ul and r 6\u2208 Ur . Then,\nU = {x \u2208 Ul \u2229 Ur : l < x < r} = {x \u2208 Ul \u2229 Ur : l \u2264 x \u2264 r}\nis a clopen neighbourhood of \u03b1 with U \u2282 {x \u2208 X : l < x < r}.\nThat is, \u03b1X has a clopen base at \u03b1 and it is first countable at this point.\nThen, let {Un : n < \u03c9} be a decreasing clopen base at \u03b1, with U0 =\n\u03b1X. Next, for every point x \u2208 X, let n(x) = max{n : x \u2208 Un } and, for\nconvenience, n(\u03b1) = \u03c9. Finally, we may define a linear order \"\u227a\" on \u03b1X by\nputting x \u227a y if and only if\neither n(x) < n(y) or n(x) = n(y) and x < y.\nSince {Un : n < \u03c9} is a decreasing clopen base at \u03b1, the order \"\u227a\" is\ncompatible with the topology of \u03b1X. It is clear that, with respect to \"\u227a\",\n\u03b1 is the last element of X. This completes the proof.\nReferences\n[1] Giuliano Artico and Umberto Marconi, Selections and topologically well-ordered spaces,\nTopology Appl. 115 (2001), no. 3, 299\u2013303. MR 1 848 130\n[2] R.
