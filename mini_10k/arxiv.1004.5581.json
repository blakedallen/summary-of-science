We propose the use of a supersonic\natomic beam, which provides an extremely high-brightness and cold source of fast atoms. The atoms\nare to be focused onto a substrate using a thin magnetic film, into which apertures with widths on\nthe order of 100 nm have been etched. Focused spot sizes near or below 10 nm, with focal lengths\non the order of 10 \u03bcm, are predicted. This scheme is applicable both to precision patterning of\nsurfaces with metastable atomic beams and to direct deposition of material.\n\nNanoscale fabrication is a critical tool for realizing\nmuch of modern technology, including information processing, biomedical research, and photonics [1\u20133]. Optical lithography, the current method for chip mass production, is used to produce many features in parallel, but\nhas a limited resolution due to the wavelength of light\nused. Electron beam (e-beam) lithography, a method for\nproducing much smaller (order of 1 nm) features, is a\nserial, rather than parallel, method, meaning that it is\nmuch more time-consuming than optical lithography. Ebeam, however, is frequently used to fabricate the masks\nthat are required by the latter. Additional methods, using vacuum ultraviolet or X-ray radiation [4], or using\nfocused ion beams [5], are being developed in an effort\nto achieve high-resolution and high-throughput nanofabrication.\nOne area of great potential for nanofabrication is atom\nlithography [6, 7]. The deBroglie wavelength of atoms\nis typically much less than an optical wavelength, potentially resulting in a much smaller diffraction-limited\nspot size. Additionally, fabrication operations are parallelizable; much work has focused on depositing multiple\nlines and dots of atoms by focusing from a standing light\nwave [8\u201312]. In addition, atom lithography is versatile in\nthe sense that one may either directly write structures\nonto a substrate [13\u201317], or may pattern a resist prior\nto etching, as in traditional lithography, using a beam of\nmetastable atoms [18]. The primary limitation of optical\nfocusing is that it is difficult to focus some of the atoms\nwithout simultaneously defocusing others, leading to significant aberrations and an unwanted underlayer of material. A method of mitigating this effect was proposed\n[19] and demonstrated [20], but is challenging to implement in practice. Alternative approaches, such as focusing of atoms using macroscopic magnetic lenses [21] or\nan \"atom pinhole camera\" [22] have also been explored.\nAll the above techniques have used effusive beams, limiting atomic density to around 1010 atoms/cm3 , and have\nachieved controlled feature sizes (at best) on the order of\n100 nm.\nIn this Letter, we propose a new approach to atom\nlithography that should enable much smaller feature sizes\nand larger throughput. Our method consists of magnetic\n\nfocusing of a supersonic beam through a nanofabricated\nmagnetic mask. As nearly all atoms are paramagnetic in\neither the ground state or an accessible metastable state,\nmagnetic focusing is a very general approach. Furthermore, the supersonic beam provides both high atomic\nflux and a low temperature T \u2248 100 mK, a unique combination. This paper is organized as follows. We first\npresent details of our proposed method, including the supersonic source and focusing apparatus. We then provide\nsimulation results, including spot sizes and focal lengths\nfor a number of atomic species. Finally, we discuss the\nscalability of this scheme.\nOur proposed apparatus (see Fig. 1) consists of two\nmain components: a supersonic beam of spin-polarized\natoms, and a thin magnetic mask into which an array\nof holes of O(100 nm) width is etched, through which\nthe atoms are focused onto a substrate. Depending on\nwhether one wishes to deposit material or pattern using\nexcited-state atoms, one either entrains atoms into the\nbeam from one or more ovens, or excites the carrier gas\nto a metastable level in a discharge. The basic principle of\nour method is that the very high magnetic field gradients\ndue to the tiny holes in the magnetic material will be\nable to focus atoms, even though they are travelling at\nhundreds of meters per second.\nA continuous-wave supersonic beam [23, 24] will provide an atomic flux on the order of 1020 atoms/sr/s [25].\nA typical fraction of either metastable or entrained atoms\nin the beam is 10\u22123 . Following a skimmer, atoms in a\nspecific internal magnetic sublevel mJ will be selected\nby some method of magnetic filtering; either magnetic\nguiding or deflection may be used. Alternatively, optical\npumping could be implemented on many atomic species.\nFor some species, especially metastable noble gases, laser\ncollimation (by transverse laser cooling) may be applied\nto increase the beam brightness by a factor of 103 or\nhigher, while reducing the velocity spread in the radial\ndirection [13, 26, 27].\nThe focusing mask consists of a thin film of a magnetized material, deposited on a substrate, with the magnetization vector pointing out of the plane of the film.\nSuch a film (specifically, an FePt film) was recently used\nto build a permanent-magnet chip trap for atoms [28, 29].\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematic (not to scale) of our nanolithography process. The supersonic nozzle produces a bright atomic beam,\nwhich may either be excited to a metastable level in a discharge or have atoms entrained into it from some number of ovens.\nFollowing this, the beam is collimated by passing through a skimmer. Magnetic filtering ensures that only the correct mJ state\narrives at the mask, which then focuses the atoms onto a substrate. (b) Schematic (not to scale) of a single hole in the mask\nwith proposed dimensions given. A Si3 N4 substrate supports a 300 nm-thick FePt mask with perpendicular magnetization of\n670 kA/m. Only small regions of the mask and substrate are shown; the actual length of the substrate is on the order of 1 \u03bcm.\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field within the hole in the mask is plotted (color online).\n\nHoles of diameter on the order of 100 nm will be etched\ninto the film and into the substrate that supports it\n(Fig. 1). This substrate could be made of one of many\nmaterials, such as silicon nitride (Si3 N4 ). The holes in\nboth layers may be fabricated by conventional e-beam\nlithography, or possibly by optical lithography. Although\nthe e-beam process is time-consuming, it only needs to\nbe done once to create a \"master\" mask that can be used\nmany times, as in the case of optical lithography.\nThe atoms are focused by the force F~ due to the interaction of the atomic magnetic dipole moment \u03bc\n~ with\n~ of the magnetized mask: F~ =\nthe\u0010 magnetic\nfield\nB\n\u0011\n~ . Assuming the atomic magnetic dipole adi\u2207 \u03bc\n~ *B\nabatically follows the magnetic field, we may write the\nforce in the radial direction (normal to the propagation\ndirection) as Fr = \u2212\u03bcB gJ mJ (\u2202|B|/\u2202r), where \u03bcB is\nthe Bohr magneton and gJ is the Land\u00e9 g-factor. For\nthe simulations that follow, we assume a material thickness of 300 nm and a perpendicular magnetization of\nM = 670 kA/m [28, 29]. We also choose a hole diameter\nof 150 nm. The magnetic fields are computed numerically; the peak field near such a hole is |B| \u2248 0.8 T (see\nFig. 1).\nTo estimate the number of atoms that passes through\neach hole per unit time, as well as to estimate the spread\nin radial velocities, we use a simple model of geometric\ncollimation. The efficiency \u000f represents the fraction of\natoms emitted from a skimmer of radius rs that will pass\nthrough the focusing aperture; it is calculated as the ratio\nof the area of the circular hole in the mask to the area\nof the atomic beam at the position of the mask. Writing\nthe beam divergence angle as \u03b8, the distance from the\nskimmer to the mask as d, and the radius of the hole\n2\n2\nas rm , \u000f = rm\n/ (rs + d tan \u03b8) . Typical numbers for our\nchosen conditions are rs = 125 \u03bcm, rm = 75 nm, \u03b8 = 7\u25e6 ,\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Cross-section of 250 trajectories for 20 Ne with a\ncenter-of-mass speed of 400 m/s and a collimation distance of\nd = 2 m. The front face of the mask is located on z = 0, and\nthe center of the hole lies on r = 0. The spot size w0 is 8.5 nm\nand the focal length is f = 34 \u03bcm. The color of the trajectories changes from black to blue at the focal plane. This spot\nsize is less than the diffraction-limited spot size wd = 13.2 nm;\nthe true spot size will be the result of the convolution of an\nAiry disc of diameter wd with the distribution of atoms found\nvia ray tracing. (b) Density of atoms as a function of radius\nat the focal point for the data in (a).\n\nand d = 2 m, leading to \u000f \u2248 1 \u00d7 10\u221213 . Given the beam\nbrightness of 1020 atoms/sr/s, a discharge or entrainment\nefficiency of 10\u22123 , and a loss of one in ten atoms due to\nmagnetic filtering, we estimate a flux through each hole\nof \u2248 103 atoms/s.\nThe primary goal of our simulations is to calculate the\nfocused spot sizes as the parameters of the problem, including the atomic species and the amount of collimation, are varied. Unless stated otherwise, we assume\nthat the beam is moving with a center-of-mass speed of\nv0 = 400 m/s, an appropriate value for a neon beam at\n77 K. We also assume the radius of the (circular) skimmer is rs = 125 \u03bcm. We assign each atom a random\nradial velocity, due to geometric collimation, within the\nrange \u2206vr \u2248 2rs v0 /d, where d is the distance from the\n\n\f3\nskimmer to the mask. The spread in velocities along the\npropagation axis \u2206vz is a property of the beam that is\ndue to the supersonic expansion (not to collimation). It\nis assumed, based on measurements in our laboratory,\nto be fixed at \u2206vz = 14 m/s for neon at 77 K. Simulations are performed by numerically integrating the equations of motion for a particle moving through the hole\nin the mask. The spot size w0 is calculated as twice\nthe average value hri of the radius of atoms at the focal\npoint, weighted\nof atoms at a given raR by the density\nR\ndius: hri = (\u03c1(r) r dr) / (\u03c1(r) dr), where \u03c1(r) is the\ndensity of atoms at radius r and the integral is evaluated\ndiscretely using dr = 1 nm.\nWe present simulation results in Fig. 2 showing focusing of metastable neon. Even when many atoms reach\nthe substrate far from hri, the density of atoms there is\norders of magnitude less than near the focus. There are\ntwo dominant mechanisms, apart from limited collimation, by which the spot is broadened: aberrations, and\nvan der Waals attractions within the substrate and mask.\nAberrations appear in the numerical solution to the fields\nwithin the mask. Van der Waals forces are modelled by\nincluding a force term in the equations of motion that was\ncalculated numerically and is well-approximated as being\nproportional to D2\u22124 \u2212 D1\u22124 , where D2 is the distance to\nthe nearest edge of the tube and D1 the distance to the\nfurthest edge. For atoms that are close enough to the wall\nof the tube, this force either causes the atom to collide\nwith the tube or to strike the substrate far from the focused spot. Atoms that strike the tube walls are removed\nfrom the simulation, because they will, with high probability, either release their internal energy, making them\nuseless for patterning, or scatter inelastically and not be\nfocused. Although we obtain a simulated spot size of\nw0 = 8.5 nm, the diffraction-limited spot size wd for our\nparameters is wd = 1.22\u03bbdB f /(2rm ) = 13.2 nm, where\nthe deBroglie wavelength \u03bbdB = h/(mv) \u2248 0.25 nm.\nTherefore, our simulations suggest that we can focus to\na diffraction-limited spot size.\nHighlighting the generality of our method, our simulations show that the same mask can focus a very wide\nrange of atomic masses with spot sizes of O(10 nm).\nFig. 3 shows the spot sizes as a function of collimation\ndistance d. For low d, the radial velocity spread dominates, while for high d, van der Waals forces and spherical\naberrations dominate. In Table I, we report the expected\nspot size and focal length for several species of interest\nat a fixed value of d = 2 m. For some atoms, laser excitation at a single frequency will be necessary, since they\nare either non-paramagnetic or have too small a magnetic\nmoment in the ground state. For these species, a single\nphoton will suffice to pump the atom (with some probability) into a suitable metastable state, which must have\na lifetime larger than the time it takes for the atom to be\ndeposited (typically a few milliseconds). Two notable\nexamples are indium and gallium, which each occupy\n\nFIG. 3: Simulated spot size w0 as a function of collimation\ndistance d for four atomic species. All species except phosphorus are in a metastable excited state (given in Table I). These\nlarge-d spot sizes are smaller than the diffraction-limited spot\nsizes, also reported in Table I. Helium has the largest spot size\nat large d because it is affected more, due to its low mass, by\nvan der Waals forces, while at small d, the spot is smaller due\nto its relatively high ratio of magnetic moment to mass.\n\nSpecies\n4\nHe\n20\nNe\n31\nP\n70\nGa\n114\nIn\n\n|~\n\u03bc| (\u03bcB )\n2\n3\n3\n6\n6\n\nw0 (nm)\n8.5\n10.0\n12.1\n11.7\n17.1\n\nwd (nm)\n14.6\n13.2\n11.7\n6.2\n5.9\n\nf (\u03bcm)\n7.2\n32.6\n44.6\n53.7\n82.3\n\nState\n3\nS1\n3\nP2\n4\nS3/2\n2\nP3/2\n2\nP3/2\n\nTABLE I: Spot sizes (w0 ) and focal lengths (f ) for a variety of species. All are travelling at 400 m/s and have traversed 2 m following a 250 \u03bcm skimmer. The approximate\ndiffraction-limited spot size wd is also given; the actual spot\nsize is expected to be the convolution of the atomic distribution of waist w0 and the Airy disc of diameter wd . The\nmagnetic moment (|~\n\u03bc|), and atomic state are given for reference. All except 31 P are in metastable states. The width of\nboth the substrate and the mask is 150 \u03bcm.\n\na 2 P1/2 ground state, with maximal magnetic moment\n\u03bcB /3. A single photon, at 410 nm for In and at 403 nm\nfor Ga, would pump the atoms to a metastable 2 P3/2\nstate, with maximal magnetic moment 6\u03bcB , a state that\nis focused very well. The branching ratio into the desired\nstate is 38% for In and 67% for Ga [34].\nFor several of the species we examined, the spot\nsize is limited by diffraction from the mask aperture.\nSince the diameter of the Airy disc is given by wd =\n1.22\u03bbdB f /(2rm ), a decrease in the ratio f /rm will reduce the diffraction limit. Simulations with multiple layers of thin film magnetic material show a decreased focal length with identical mask apertures, resulting in a\nsmaller diffraction limit with similar or better spot sizes.\n\n\f4\nAlternatively, advances in the science of thin film magnetic materials may provide for greater magnetizations,\nwhich would similarly reduce the focal length. As such,\nwe do not regard the calculated diffraction limits for\nour simulated apparatus as being the best that can be\nachieved with this method.\nAmong the many potential applications of our method,\none of the most intriguing is the fabrication of quantum dots. Currently, quantum dots are most frequently\nfabricated by molecular beam epitaxy, which results in\nquantum dots of random size and location. Our scheme\ncould produce dots with a position known to within a\nfew nm and a size limited only by the Poisson fluctuations. Mounting the mask on a nanometer-resolution\ntranslation stage increases the versatility of our method.\nFor instance, the quantum dots could be combined with\nnanofabricated wires or mirrors, producing electrical or\noptical interconnects between the dots. This could enable one vision of quantum computation with quantum\ndots [30, 31]. Our method has many other potential uses,\nas well: applications to basic science include plasmonics [32], metamaterials [33], and quantum photonics [2],\nwhile applications of commercial interest include photovoltaics, light sources, and light sensors.\nIn conclusion, we have outlined a new method for\nfabricating a wide variety of nanoscale devices with an\nunprecedented combination of nanometer precision and\nhigh throughput. Our method relies on technologies that\nare well understood, including supersonic beams and\nmagnetic filtering, and has no strenuous laser requirements. One element that remains to be developed is the\nmagnetic mask, but the required magnetic film and ebeam patterning technology are readily available. Our\nmethod should open up new possibilities in the fabrication of nanoscale semiconductor quantum devices, including light sources and detectors, plasmonic devices,\nand quantum information processors.\nWe gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions with\nDan Ralph, David Sellmyer, Andrew Houck, Walt de\nHeer, and Rene Gerritsma, and funding from the Sid W.\nRichardson Foundation.\n\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n\n[23]\n[24]\n\n[25]\n[26]\n\n[27]\n\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n\n[1] P.
