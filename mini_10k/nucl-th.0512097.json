Significant progress has been achieved in this direction with\nthe use of chiral perturbation theory [1]. On the other hand, relativistic mean field (RMF)\nmodels have been sucessfully used to describe the bulk properties of nuclear matter, finite\nnuclei and dense stars [2, 3, 4, 5]. Although they are only effective models, they are simple,\ndepend only on few parameters and are the ideal tool to test certain aspects of nuclear\nmatter.\nIn this work we shall use the relativistic mean field model discussed in [4] to investigate\nthe formation and propagation of Korteveg - de Vries solitons in nuclear matter. Assuming\nthat nuclear matter behaves like an ideal fluid we wish to know whether small baryon density\nperturbations can propagate without dissipation through the medium. If this turns out to be\ncase, these pulses might be responsible for interesting phenomena. One of them would be the\napparent nuclear transparency in proton nucleus collisions at low energies. The impinging\nproton would be absorbed by the fluid and turned into a density pulse. It would then be able\nto traverse the target nucleus emerging on the other side. This idea has been first advanced\nin [6]. In [7] the experimental evidence of this \"nuclear transparency\" was discussed. In [8]\nthe formalism was improved with the inclusion of viscosity and three-dimensional expansion.\nIn [9] the effect of the nuclear surface was considered. One important lesson from all these\nworks is that the formation of solitons depends in a crucial way on the equation of state\n(EOS). In [6, 7, 8, 9] the equation of state employed was borrowed from [10] and it was very\nphenomenological, containing no information about the microscopic nucleon dynamics.\nThe experimental signature of the nuclear soliton is very difficult to measure, since the\noutcoming nucleon emerges in a direction very close to the beam. Probably because of this\nreason the subject was left aside for almost ten years. Soliton formation in nuclear matter\nwas then revived in [11], where a different equation of state was considered. This EOS was\ndeveloped in [12] and was based on the nucleon-nucleon microscopic interaction given by the\nSkyrme force. The main finding of [11] was that the nuclear soliton is not a compression\npulse, as thought before. Instead, it is a rarefaction pulse due to a sign inversion appearing\nbecause of the use of Skyrme interactions.\nNow, another ten years later, we come back to this subject because we feel that this\n2\n\n\fbeautiful idea has not been explored enough. We shall replace the EOS used in the early\nworks by another one, based on the model of [4]. The usual relativistic mean field models\ndo not generate equations of state which lead to solitons because they do not contain higher\nderivatives, required in nonlinear differential equations. Therefore we will introduce a new\ninteraction term in the Lagrangian of [4].\nThis work is organized as follows. In the next section we present some simple formulas\nof nonrelativistic hydrodynamics and write them in terms of the baryon and energy density.\nThis will help to establish the connection between these equations and the relativistic mean\nfield EOS. In the subsequent section we discuss the model of [4], introduce the new interaction\nterm and, in the mean field approximation, derive the equation of state. In the following\nsection, we combine the hydrodynamic equations with the new EOS and derive the KdV\nequation and its analytical solution. The last section contains some concluding remarks.\n\nII.\n\nHYDRODYNAMICS\n\nThe basic equations of nonrelativistic hydrodynamics [13] are Euler equation\n\u2202~v\n1\n\u2207p\n+ (~v * \u2207)~v = \u2212\n\u2202t\n\u03c1\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n(1)\n\nand the continuity equation\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1~v ) = 0\n(2)\n\u2202t\nIn these equations, \u03c1 is the mass density, which, in the nuclear medium, is related to the\nbaryon density through\n\u03c1 = M\u03c1B\n\n(3)\n\nwhere M is the nucleon mass. The enthalpy per nucleon is given by [13]:\ndh = T ds + V dp\nwhere\n\nV = 1/\u03c1B\n\n(4)\n\nis the specific volume. For a perfect fluid (ds = 0) the equation above\n\nbecomes dp = \u03c1B dh and consequently:\n\u2207p = \u03c1B \u2207h\n\n(5)\n\nInserting (3) and (5) in (1) and in (2) we obtain\n1\n\u2202~v\n\u2207h\n+ (~v * \u2207)~v = \u2212\n\u2202t\nM\n\u0012\n\n3\n\n\u0013\n\n(6)\n\n\fand\n\u2202\u03c1B\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1B ~v ) = 0\n\u2202t\n\n(7)\n\nThe enthalpy per nucleon may also be written as [11]:\nh = E + \u03c1B\n\n\u2202E\n\u2202\u03c1B\n\n(8)\n\nwhere E is the energy per nucleon given by:\n\u03b5\n\u03c1B\n\n(9)\n\n\u2202\u03b5\n\u2202\u03c1B\n\n(10)\n\nE=\nwhich inserted in (8) leads to:\nh=\nand therefore:\n\n\u2207h = \u2207\n\n\u2202\u03b5\n\u2202\u03c1B\n\n(11)\n\nWith these simple manipulations we can make explicit the dependence of Euler equation (6)\non \u03b5(\u03c1B ), or in other words, on the equation of state of nuclear matter.\nAs it will be seen later, it is possible to perform a combination of (6) and (7) in a specific\nway to obtain a nonlinear differential equation for the baryon density, with soliton solutions.\nThe existence or not of these solitons depends on the function \u03b5(\u03c1B ). A key feature of\n(6) and (11) is that they contain the gradient of the derivative of the energy density. If \u03b5\ncontains a Laplacian of \u03c1B , i.e.,\n\u03b5 \u221d ... + ...\u22072 \u03c1B + ...\n\n(12)\n\nthen equation (6) will have a cubic derivative with respect to the space coordinate, which\nwill give rise to the Korteweg-de Vries equation for the density. The most popular RMF\nmodels do not have higher derivative terms and, even if they have at the start, these terms\nare usually neglected during the calculations. In the next section we show how to overcome\nthese limitations and obtain a slightly more general expression for \u03b5(\u03c1B ) with Laplacians.\n\nIII.\n\nMODIFIED QHD\n\nWe start with the well known variant of QHD-I [5], employed in [4]:\nL0 = \u03c8\u0304[\u03b3\u03bc (i\u2202 \u03bc \u2212 gV V \u03bc ) \u2212 (M \u2212 gS \u03c6)]\u03c8 +\n4\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 mS 2 \u03c62\n2\n\n\f1\nb\u03c63 c\u03c64\n1\n\u2212\n(13)\n\u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + mV 2 V\u03bc V \u03bc \u2212\n4\n2\n3\n4\nwhere, as usual, the degrees of freedom are the baryon field \u03c8, the neutral scalar meson\nfield \u03c6 and the neutral vector meson field V\u03bc , with the respective couplings and masses. The\nparameters b and c will be taken from [4]. As it can be seen, there are no higher order\nderivatives. This is the reason why the traditional QHD and most of its numerous variants\ndo not give an equation of state compatible with soliton propagation, like (12). For this\nit is necessary, in first place, to modify the Lagrangian, introducing a term with Laplacian\nderivative couplings. The simplest one is given by:\nLM \u2261\n\ngV\n\u03c8\u0304(\u2202\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd V\u03bc )\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8\nmV 2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the subscrit M denotes \"modification\" in QHD. First of all, this term is designed to\n\nbe small in comparison with the main baryon - vector meson interaction term gV \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc V \u03bc \u03c8.\nBecause of the derivatives, it is of the order of:\np2\nkF2\n\u223c\n\u223c 0.12\nm2V\nm2V\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the Fermi momentum is kF \u2243 0.28 GeV and mV \u2243 0.8 GeV. The form chosen for\nLM is not dictated by any symmetry argument, has no other deep justification and is just\none possible interaction term among many others [14]. It is used here as a prototype. In\nthe future, we plan to address this problem with a state of the art Lagrangian. As it can be\nimmediately guessed, the integration by parts of LM leads to a D'Alembertian acting on the\n\nbaryon current. We present (14) with the derivatives acting on V \u03bc just because it can be\nmore easily compared to gV \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc V \u03bc \u03c8 it allows for estimates like (15).

This means that\nthe perturbation changes slightly the energy of the system, but does not affect the dynamics\nof the environment, i.e., of the unperturbed \u03c8, \u03c6 and V \u03bc fields. The energy density is\ncalculated using the energy-momentum tensor:\n\u03b5 =< T00 >= \u2212g00 L\u2032 + (\u22020 \u03c8)\n\n\u2202L\u2032\n\u2202(\u2202 0 \u03c8)\n\n(23)\n\nwhich, with the help of (19), (20), (21) is given by:\n\u03b5=\n+\n\n\u03b3\n(2\u03c0)3\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nkF\n\nmS 2 (M \u2217 \u2212 M) 2\ngV 2 2\n+\n\u03c1\n+\n2mV 2 B\n2\ngS\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nc\nb\nd3 k(~k 2 + M \u2217 2 )1/2 + 3 (M \u2217 \u2212 M)3 + 4 (M \u2217 \u2212 M)4\n3gS\n4gS\n+\n\ngV 2\n\u2202 2 \u03c1B\ngV 2\n2\n\u03c1\n\u2207\n\u03c1\n\u2212\n\u03c1\nB\nB\nB\nmV 4\nmV 4\n\u2202t2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(24)\n\nwhere (\u03b3) is the baryon spin-isospin degeneracy factor and M \u2217 stands for the nucleon effective\nmass:\nM \u2217 \u2261 M \u2212 gS \u03c60\nThe two terms in the last line of (24) come from LM . Baryon number propagation in nuclear\nmatter has been studied in [15] with the help of the diffusion equation:\n\u2202\u03c1B\n= D \u22072 \u03c1B\n\u2202t\n\n(25)\n\nwhere the diffusion constant D was numerically evaluated as a function of density and\ntemperature and found to be D \u2243 0.35 f m at densities comparable to the equilibrium\nnuclear density and temperatures of the order of 80 MeV. The exact value of D at T = 0\nis unknown but its dependence both with temperature and density is very smooth and an\nextrapolation to T = 0 points to values even smaller than 0.35 fm. This number is small\n6\n\n\fcompared to any nuclear size scale and can be interpreted as indicating that density gradients\ndo not disappear very rapidly in nucler matter. Using (25) twice in the last term of (24) it\ncan be rewritten as:\n\u2202 2 \u03c1B\ngV 2\n\u03c1\n\u2212\nB\nmV 4\n\u2202t2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\ngV 2\ngV 2\n\u2202\n2\nD\u2207\n\u03c1\n=\n\u2212\n=\u2212\n\u03c1\n\u03c1B D 2 [\u22072 (\u22072 \u03c1B )]\nB\nB\n4\n4\nmV\n\u2202t\nmV\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(26)\n\nwhich, in the context of the present calculation, can be neglected because \u22072 (\u22072 \u03c1B ) <<\n(\u22072 \u03c1B ). With this last approximation, the final form of the energy density is given by (24)\n\nwithout the last term. The baryon density up to the Fermi level (kF ) is given by:\n\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8 \u2261 \u03c1B =\n\n\u03b3(kF )3\n6\u03c0 2\n\nAs usual, the nucleon effective mass is determined by the minimization of \u03b5(M \u2217 ) with respect\nto M \u2217 , which results in the self-consistency relation:\nM\u2217 = M \u2212\n\ngS 2 \u03b3\nmS 2 (2\u03c0)3\n\nZ\n\nkF\n\n0\n\nM\u2217\nd3 k \u0010\n\u0011\n~k 2 + M \u2217 2 1/2\n\nc\ngS2 b\n\u2212 2 3 (M \u2217 \u2212 M)2 + 4 (M \u2217 \u2212 M)3\nms gS\ngS\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nThe main result of this section is (24), which, in what follows, will be used in the derivation of the KdV equation. By keeping \u22072 \u03c1B (but not \u22072 \u22072 \u03c1B ) we take into account the\nsmall inhomogeneities, which do not change rapidly in time (and therefore we neglect\n\n\u2202\u03c1B\n).\n\u2202t\n\nWhereas this approximation is quite often used at the nuclear surface, it is not very common\nfor the bulk of nuclear matter. We believe, however, that it is quite reasonable.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE KDV SOLITONS\n\nIn this section we follow the treatment developed in [6] and [11] to obtain the Korteweg-de\nVries equation in one dimension by the combination of (6) and (7).\nExpression (24) is valid for any \u03c1B . In order to make contact with the nuclear matter\nphenomenology and use the constraints imposed by the saturation curve, we will now use (24)\nto compute the energy per baryon E (9). We then Taylor expand it around the equilibrium\ndensity \u03c10 up to second order:\n1 \u22022E\nE(\u03c1B ) = E(\u03c10 ) +\n2 \u2202\u03c1B 2\n\u0012\n\n7\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c1B =\u03c10\n\n(\u03c1B \u2212 \u03c10 )2\n\n(27)\n\n\fwhere the first order term vanishes because of the saturation condition\n\u2202\n\u03b5\n\u2212M\n\u2202\u03c1B \u03c1B\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n=\n\u03c1B =\u03c10\n\n\u2202E\n\u2202\u03c1B\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n0\n\n\u03c1B =\u03c10\n\nThe derivative coefficient in (27) may be rewritten as [11]:\n\u0012\n\n\u22022E\n\u2202\u03c1B 2\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u03c1B =\u03c10\n\nMcs 2\n\u03c120\n\nwhere M is the nucleon mass and cs is the speed of sound in nuclear matter.

Inserting (28) in (6) we arrive at:\n\u2202~v\ncs 2\n[6\u03c1B (\u2207\u03c1B ) \u2212 4\u03c10 (\u2207\u03c1B )]\n+ (~v * \u2207)~v = \u2212\n\u2202t\n2\u03c10 2\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\ngV 2\n\u2207(\u22072 \u03c1B )\nMmV 4\n\u0013\n\n(30)\n\nWe now repeat the steps developed in [6] and [11], write (30) and (7) in one space dimension\n(x) and introduce dimensionless variables for the density and velocity:\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\n\u03c1B\n\u03c10\n\n(31)\n\nv\u0302 =\n\nv\ncs\n\n(32)\n\nand\n\nWe next define the \"stretched coordinates\" \u03be and \u03c4 as in [6, 11, 16]:\n\u03be = \u03c3 1/2\n\n8\n\n(x \u2212 cs t)\nR\n\n(33)\n\n\fand\n\u03c4 = \u03c3 3/2\n\ncs t\nR\n\n(34)\n\nwhere R is a size scale and \u03c3 is a small (0 < \u03c3 < 1) expansion parameter chosen to be [16]:\n\u03c3=\n\n| u \u2212 cs |\ncs\n\n(35)\n\nwhere u is the propagation speed of the perturbation. After these tedious but straightforward\nsubstitutions, we expand (31) and (32) around their equilibrium values:\n\u03c1\u0302 = 1 + \u03c3\u03c11 + \u03c3 2 \u03c12 + . . .\n\n(36)\n\nv\u0302 = \u03c3v1 + \u03c3 2 v2 + . . .\n\n(37)\n\nEquations (30) and (7) will contain power series in \u03c3 up to \u03c3 2 . Since the coefficients in these\nseries are independent we get a set of equations, which, when combined, lead to the KdV\nequation for \u03c11\n\u2202\u03c11\n\u2202 3 \u03c11\ngV 2 \u03c10\n\u2202\u03c11\n+ 3\u03c11\n+\n=0\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202\u03be\n2Mcs 2 mV 4 R2 \u2202\u03be 3\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(38)\n\nwhich has a well known soliton solution. We may rewrite the above equation back in the\nx \u2212 t space obtaining a KdV-like equation for \u03c1\u03021 with the following solitonic solution:\nmV 2\n(u \u2212 cs )\nsech2\n\u03c1\u03021 (x, t) =\ncs\ngV\n\u0014\n\ns\n\n(u \u2212 cs )cs M\n(x \u2212 ut)\n2\u03c10\n\n\u0015\n\n(39)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u03021 \u2261 \u03c3\u03c11 . The solution above is a bump with width \u03bb given by:\ngV\n\u03bb=\nmV 2\n\ns\n\n2\u03c10\n(u \u2212 cs )cs M\n\n(40)\n\nSince\n0 < sech2 (\u03b8) \u2264 1\nand since\nu \u2212 cs\n=\u03c3\u22641\ncs\n\n(41)\n\nwe can see that \u03c1\u03021 is always smaller than one and is consistent with the expansion (36). Relation (41) implies that u \u2264 umax = 2cs . This upper bound is arbitrary, being a consequence\nof the choice (35), but it must exist. As mentioned in the introduction, the perturbation of\nthe medium may be caused by the passage of a nucleon projectile and we expect that for\nhigher projectile energies the modification of medium will be so strong that our perturbative\n9\n\n\fapproach will break down. The upper bound in the pulse velocity implies a limit for the\nmomentum of the incident nucleon given by:\npmax = \u221a\n\n2cs M\n1 \u2212 4cs 2\n\n(42)\n\nAs it can be seen from (40), the soliton width depends on parameters of the microscopic\ndynamics, as the coupling and mass which come from the Lagrangian (16). The sound\nvelocity comes from the EOS derived from the same Lagrangian. The expression (40) also\nreveals the supersonic nature of this phenomenon, since it is only possible for u > cs .\nIn the case where the density pulse is caused by a nucleon traversing a nucleus, if the\nwidth is comparable to the nucleon size and much smaller than the nuclear radius, the pulse\nwill be localized and the impinging nucleon may emerge from the nucleus. If, on the other\nhand, \u03bb is large, of the order of the nuclear radius, then the incident energy will most likely\nbe absorbed by the nucleus as a whole, which will undergo some collective excitation and\ndecay.\nIn the numerical evaluation of (40) we need to know the values of the parameters appearing in the Lagrangians (13) and (14). For L0 we consider both the original QHD-I, without\nthe nonlinear terms, just as a reference, and the most phenomenologically successful model\nof [4], with its different parameter choices labeled by NL1, NL3, NL3 \u2212 II and NL \u2212 SH.\nThe use of the original QHD-I equation of state in hydrodynamical calculations leads to a\ntoo rapidly expanding system, as it was shown in [17].\nAll the input numbers as well as the calculated incompressibilities K, equilibrium densities\n\u03c10 , nucleon effective masses M \u2217 and sound velocities cs are shown in Table 1.\n\n10\n\n\fQHD NL1 NL3 NL3 \u2212 II NL \u2212 SH\nK(MeV)\n\n545\n\n211\n\n272\n\n272\n\n355\n\nM(MeV)\n\n939\n\n938\n\n939\n\n939\n\n939\n\nmS (MeV ) 500\n\n492\n\n508,2 507,7\n\n526\n\nmV (MeV ) 780\n\n783\n\n782,5 781,9\n\n783\n\ngS\n\n8,7\n\n10,14 10,22 10,2\n\n10,4\n\ngV\n\n11,62 13,28 12,87 12,8\n\n12,9\n\nM \u2217 /M\n\n0,56\n\n0,57\n\n0,6\n\n0,59\n\n0,6\n\n\u03c10 (f m\u22123 ) 0,19\n\n0,15\n\n0,15\n\n0,15\n\n0,15\n\nb(f m\u22121 )\n\n0\n\n-12,17 -10,43 -10,4\n\n-6,9\n\nc\n\n0\n\n-36,26 -28,9 -28,9\n\n-15,8\n\ncs\n\n0,25\n\n0,16\n\n0,2\n\n0,18\n\n0,18\n\nTable 1: input parameters and results for K, M \u2217 , \u03c10 and cs .\n\nIt is interesting to observe that the maximal momentum pmax depends on cs and therefore\nwill be different for different models.\nChoosing values for u, from cs to umax , and computing both \u03bb and p up to pmax for\nthe different models, we obtain the curves shown in Fig. 1. As it can be seen, the width\ndecreases with the projectile energy, as anticipated in [18]. We can also see that, the stiffer\nis the equation of state, the wider is the window for soliton formation. At bombarding\nenergies of a few hundred MeV the collisions are probably too violent and the departure\nfrom the initial equilibrium state is too large for the soliton picture to be true. At energies\nsmaller than 200 MeV, the width starts to be larger but still significantly smaller than the\nnuclear radius. Moreover, the choice of gV in (14) was just a first guess. The derivative\ncoupling could be different and much weaker, leading to narrower solitons. As it appears\nnow in (40) \u03bb is directly proportional to gV . If the coupling would be half of the value used\nhere, even the softest EOS (NL1) would lead to narrow solitons. After having established\nthe connection between KdV solitons and relativistic mean field models, we can test other\ntheories and other derivative couplings.\nThe observation of KdV solitons in nucleon-nucleus collisions was also discussed in [19],\nconsidering the exisiting experimental results at that time. Nowadays much more data are\n\n11\n\n\favailable and it might be interesting to look at them with the soliton picture in mind,\nsearching for some unexpected transparency.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nAssuming that RMF models give a satisfactory description of nuclear matter and finite\nnuclei and, also, that the nucleus can be treated as a perfect fluid, we have investigated the\npossibility of formation and propagation of Korteweg - de Vries solitons in nuclear matter.\nWe have updated the early estimates of the soliton properties, using more reliable equations\nof state. In doing so we had to introduce in the Lagrangian a term with derivative coupling\nbetween the baryon and the vector meson fields. The term used here was the simplest one\nand with it we could already find KdV solitons, which have their properties (in particular\nthe width) controled by the microscopic parameters of the underlying theory, such as masses\nand couplings. Whereas the quantitative results are not entirely conclusive, they suggest\nthat KdV may indeed exist in nuclear matter. It is fair to say that the subject deserves\nfurther investigation. Finally we would like to mention that, during the last decade, due\nto the CERN-SPS and RHIC programs, hydrodynamics has experienced a great revival\n[20, 21] and supersonic phenomena [22] were also brought back to explain recent RHIC\ndata. Nonlinear effects, as those discussed here, may be relevant also in this context.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe wish to express our gratitude to S.
