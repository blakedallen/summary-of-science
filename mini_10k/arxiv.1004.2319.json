Hussain, S.N. Sarangi and S. N. Sahu\uf023\nInstitute of Physics, Sachivalaya Marg, Bhubaneswar-751005 (India)\nStudies of photoluminescence (PL) can provide fundamental insight into the\noptical properties of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) but the same is being\nlimited by NP size distribution and low luminescence yield [1]. Inorganic\nsemiconductor core/shell [2-9] structures have added advantage of durability [2],\nhigh luminescence quantum yield (LQY), 10-80% in the visible range [2-5, 8] and\nuseful in biological labeling [6, 9-12], LED [13] and luminescence thermometry [1416] application. However, luminescence thermometry requires narrow PL line\nwidth, intense luminescence and should change with temperature linearly and\nreversibly which are difficult to achieve from lattice mismatched (3.9%-10.6%) [4]\ncore/shell structures. Here, we report a lattice matched, durable and very small\n(2.8nm) HgTe/CdTe core/shell NPs whose optical activities are shown to be in the\nUV range and have yielded very high luminescence. The reversible change of PL\nwith temperature of the core/shell NPs is used as an optical probe temperature\nsensor with resolution 0.32% per degree Kelvin which deemed to be one of the\nefficient luminescence thermometers reported till date.\nThe colloidal chalcogenide semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) are best known for\ntheir efficient fluorescence (FL) or photoluminescence (PL) in the visible [1,17,18], near\ninfrared [19] and infrared [20] regions that depend upon NP size and are largely limited\nby NP size, size distribution and recombination loses at the surface trap sites [1] due to\n\n\uf023\n\nCorresponding author, E-mail: sahu@iopb.res.in, Phone: +91-674-2301058 extn-226\nFax: +91-674-2300142\n\n1\n\n\flarge unsaturated surface dangling bonds. The size distribution can be minimized by an\norganic ligand capping [21]. The luminescence quantum yield (LQY) and durability\nagainst photo-oxidation [2] can be improved by coating the NPs with an inorganic shell to\npassivate both anionic and cationic defects and confine [22] both electrons and holes to\nthe core such that charge leakage across the shell is prohibited to minimize recombination\nloses. The surface passivated core/shell structures [2-9, 23, 24] can achieve LQY in the\nrange of 10-85%. However, the lattice mismatch between the core and the shell of the\nepitaxially grown zinc blend core/shell structures are known to induce compressive and\ntensile strains to the core and the shell respectively which would change the band gap\n[25] of the core and shell respectively and would tend to lower the luminescence\nefficiency [26-28]. In addition, increasing the shell thickness induces a compressive strain\non the core which results in the luminescence blue shift [5]. Furthermore, core/shell NPs\nwith highly curved surfaces with good crystalline core can tolerate larger strain due to its\ndistribution and relaxation at large curved surface constituent atoms of the NPs. LQY of\n80% with CdTe/ZnTe [29] core/shell having 14% lattice mismatch has been reported\nwhere as 6.3% lattice mismatched CdSe/ZnSe core/shell could also achieve LQY of 85%\n[4]. In addition, 3.9% and 10.6% lattice mismatched CdSe/CdS [2] and CdSe/ZnS [3]\ncore/shells respectively showed much lower LQY. For type II [30] core/shell ZnTe/CdSe\ncore/shell, where their lowest electron energy states are spatially separated, the LQY is\nless than 20% even for a lattice mismatch of 0.6%. Furthermore, core/shell CdSe/ZnSe\n[4] and graded core/shell CdSe/CdS:ZnS [27] structures with lattice mismatch of 6.3 and\n3.6% respectively have yielded LQY of 85% and 84%. However, majority of the higher\nlattice mismatched core/shells showed lower LQY [2,3,6,11,14]. This implies that the\nLQY not only depend upon strain relaxation along with good crystalline core curved\nsurfaces but also require minimal lattice mismatch and uniform but optimum shell\n\n2\n\n\fthickness. The core/shell structures can, thus, find meaningful applications in LED [13]\nand biological labeling [9-12]. A more interesting application of such high LQY NPs is in\nthe area of luminescence thermometry as a temperature/pressure sensor in which the\nluminescence can act as an optical probe for aerodynamic surface temperature mapping\n[31] in wind tunnels. The requirement for such a sensor is that the device should (i) emit\nhigh yield monochromatic luminescence (ii) the change of luminescence be linear with\nthe change of temperature and (iii) should have repeatability and reversibility in the\ntemperature range under investigation. A narrow size distribution or monodispersed,\nlattice matched core/shell nanocomposite with high curved surface and high luminescence\nyield would be appropriate for optical temperature sensor applications.\nHere, we report chemical synthesis of highly stable, lattice matched and Lcysteine ethyl ester hydrochloride (LEEH) capped fairly uniform size HgTe/CdTe\ncore/shell nanocomposite with core size 2.0nm and shell thickness 0.8nm. HgTe and\nCdTe belong to the II-VI group of semiconductors with high absorption coefficients and\nband gap energies are respectively -0.15eV [32] and 1.46eV [33]. Strong excitonic\nabsorption and FL occurred at 293.0nm and 370.0nm respectively have been observed\nfrom these core/shell nanocomposites. The reversible linear change of PL with\ntemperature is used as an optical probe temperature sensor with resolution 0.32% per\ndeg.K in the temperature range of 80-370 0K.\nThe grazing angle x-ray diffraction (GXRD) of HgTe core and HgTe/CdTe\ncore/shell are shown in figure 1(a) and 1(c) respectively which exhibit fcc structures with\nprominent <111> reflection and the peak positions do not differ from one another due to\ntheir similar lattice parameters (d=3.7\u00c5). The GXRD peak intensities of the core/shell\nhave been considerably decreased compared to the core [5] and the peak positions of both\nthe core and core/shell have been shifted to higher reflection angles. The GXRD peak\n\n3\n\n\fshifts and reduction in peak intensity of the core/shell is ascribed to the decrease of\ninterplanar separation of crystal lattice and generation of compressive strain (table 1) in\nthe samples due to the large surface to volume ratio and LEEH capping. The compressive\nstrain, 0.25% of the core HgTe has been increased to 3.32% (table 1) for the HgTe/CdTe\ncore/shell presumably due to large surface to volume ratio and LEEH capping. Figure\n1(b) show the high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of core\nHgTe. The continuous lattice fringes across the crystal suggests good crystallinity of the\ncore. The average size of the core HgTe has been estimated to be 2.0nm (from histogram)\n[21].\n\nFigure 1: GXRD pattern and HRTEM micrograph of HgTe (a and b) and HgTe/CdTe core/shell NPs\n(c and d) respectively\n\n4\n\n\fTable 1: Average size of the HgTe NPs and HgTe/CdTe core/shell NPs estimated from UV-Vis, XRD and\nHRTEM studies and the compressive strain estimated from GXRD\n\nSize (in nm) estimated by\nSample\nEMA\n\nGXRD\n\nCore\n\n1.20\n\n1.87\n\nTEM\n(average)\n2.0\n\nCore/shell\n\n1.89\n\n2.12\n\n2.8\n\nCompressive strain\n(%)\n0.247\n3.32\n\nFigure 1(d) shows the HRTEM image of core/shell HgTe/CdTe with clear lattice\nfringes continuous across the entire crystal. The average size of the core/shell NPs\nobtained from the TEM micrograph and histogram (SI) is 2.8nm (table 1). The crystalline\nsizes estimated both from GXRD and TEM are comparable (table 1). An increase of size\n0.8nm of the core/shell corresponds to a shell thickness [3] of 2.1 monolayer (mL) of\nCdTe shell which is consistent with those of earlier reports [3, 29]. The continuous lattice\nfringes across the entire core/shell structure suggest the epitaxial growth of CdTe shell\nover HgTe core. The bending of the lattice fringes marked by dotted line (Fig.1 (d))\nexhibiting a well defined interface between the HgTe core and CdTe shell suggests a\ncompressive strain at the interface [3] and is in agreement with the GXRD results. The\nincreased compressive strain and reduction in GXRD peak intensities of the core/shell\nstructure confirms the formation of a core/shell HgTe/CdTe rather than an alloying effect\nin which case the GXRD peaks in figure 1(c) should have been sharpened. The fcc\nstructure of the core shifts to smaller bond lengths accompanied with the lattice constant\nshrinkage and results a quasi-spherical core/shell in agreement with earlier report [3]\nwhich suggests the growth of an uniform shell over the core despite a small compressive\nstrain of 3.32% (table 1). Assuming that the entire amount of CdTe grows over HgTe\ncore, the mean diameter of the core should increase by third root of the ratio of the molar\n\n5\n\n\fconcentration after and before coating. In the present case, the mean diameter of the core\nhas been increased by 0.8nm nearly supports the earlier core/shell work [34].\nThe absorption spectra (Fig. 2, inset) of the fairly narrow size distributed HgTe\ncore with average size 2.0nm [21] and HgTe/CdTe core/shell with average size 2.8nm\nestimated from TEM and histogram (SI) exhibit strong excitonic absorption peaks\nrespectively at 280nm and 293nm in the UV region in contrast to other II-VI group [2-5,\n29] materials and over all spectral feature are unchanged. The appearance of excitonic\nabsorption peaks in the UV region and their peak broadening are accounted respectively\nto the strong size quantization effect (as the Bohr exciton radius of HgTe is 40nm [21]\nand the synthesized NP size is only 2.0nm) and small NP size distribution. The long\nwavelength tailing in the absorption spectra is ascribed to the scattering dominated\nabsorption in powdery samples generally observed in chemically synthesized\n\n0.35\n0.30\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n\nAbsorbance (arb. unit)\n\nNormalized FL Intensity (au)\n\nsemiconductor NPs [35].\n\n0.10\n\n0.70\nCore/shell 0.65\n0.60\n0.8\n0.55\n0.50\n0.4\n0.45\n0.0\n0.40\n200 400 600 800\nW a v e l e n g t h (n m )\n\n1.2\n\nCore\n\nCore\nCore/shell\n\n0.05\n0.00\n280\n\n300\n\n320 340 360 380 400\nW a v e l e n g t h ( n m)\n\n420\n\nFigure 2: FL spectra of core HgTe and core/shell HgTe/CdTe nanoparticles with 250nm excitation, inset-\n\nUV-Vis absorption spectra of core HgTe and core/shell HgTe/CdTe nanoparticles.\n\n6\n\n\fA red shift of 13nm in the absorption peak of the core/shell with respect to the\ncore is ascribed to the increase of core/shell size compared to the core which is also\nconfirmed from GXRD and HRTEM studies. In addition, with the increase of the CdTe\nshell thickness, the exciton leaks to the shell and the peak should broaden due to the\ninorganic passivation of the core. Under this condition, the electrons leak to the shell and\nthe hole stays in the core due to its large mass. The separation between electron and hole\nlowers the exciton confinement energy which ultimately results a red shift in the\ncore/shell with respect to core. The crystalline sizes of the core and core/shell NPs were\ncross checked from optical absorption measurements using effective mass approximation\n(EMA) [36] and found to be less compared to those obtained from GXRD and HRTEM\n(table1). The discrepancy is ascribed to the non-sphericity of the NPs as well as limitation\nof EMA in the smaller size regime [37,38].\nThe FL spectra of the HgTe and HgTe/CdTe core/shells at 300 K under 250nm\nexcitation wavelength are shown in figure 2. The FL of the core with narrow line width (=\n18nm) and high colour purity appear at 370nm. Surface passivation of the HgTe core by\nthe CdTe shell results progressive enhancement of FL yield, red shifted by 3nm in\nagreement with earlier reports [2-4,6,11,14]. The red shift of 3.0nm is due to (i) increase\nin core/shell particle size compared to core and (ii) compressive strain (table 1), although\nsmall.\nIn general, the cores of the II-VI core/shell NPs, already reported are either CdSe,\nCdTe or ZnTe [2-4,6,8,29] whose Bohr exciton radii are in the range of 4 to 6nms and the\ncore/shell NPs sizes are in the range of 2-5nm. Hence, the quantum size effect (QSE)\nmanifests in those core/shells which results in the overlap of first excitonic absorption\npeak with FL or PL and attributed to band edge recombination. However, in the present\ncase, the Bohr exciton radius of HgTe is 40nm [21] and the synthesized HgTe NPs and\n\n7\n\n\fthe core/shell sizes are respectively 2.0nm and 2.8nm. Hence, very strong QSE should\nmanifest in such core and core/shell structures where the electronic energy levels should\nhighly be descritized which would lead to a large non-resonant stokes shift [39] which is\ninversely proportional to the size of the NPs [40]. The FL of the HgTe/CdTe core/shell\ndoes not overlap with the excitonic absorption peak, which suggests that the\nluminescence is not due to band edge recombination rather they are of excitonic nature.\nThe large non-resonant stokes shift of 77nm is ascribed [39, 40] to a combined effect of\n(i) the fine structure of the band edge exciton, (ii) large coupling of the electron-hole pair\nin emitting state for LO phonons in the HgTe lattice for very small NPs (iii) formation of\nexcimer within the very small clusters in concentrated solution and (iv) the organic\ncapping [41]. Non-resonant Stokes shift as large as 150nm [35,42] in semiconductor NPs\nhave already been reported. The lattice compressibility [43] of HgTe and CdTe are\nrespectively 47.6 GPa and 44.5GPa. CdTe is most compressible among all the II-VI\ncompounds except HgTe [44]. Further, CdTe has higher deformation potential [44] which\nimplies that CdTe is softer and HgTe is harder. Over coating of HgTe by CdTe shell of\n2.1 mL thick induces a small (3.25%) compressive strain at the core/shell interface. The\ncore being very small (2.0nm) with highly curved surfaces, the strain instead of relaxing\nto generate trap sites, now distributed over the constituent atoms of the curved surfaces.\nThe luminescence yield as high as 3.8 times to that of the core with high color purity in\nthe present HgTe/CdTe core/shell NPs is being observed for an optimum shell thickness\nof 2.1 mL. Further, we have found that increasing the CdTe shell thickness beyond 2.1mL\nleads to spectral red shift with lower luminescence yield due to increasing compressive\nstrain. Shell thickness less than 2.1mL again lowers the luminescence yield without much\nchange in spectral position suggests to the non-uniform surface passivation. The line\nwidth (= 18nm) of HgTe/CdTe core/shell is much less than those of core/shells reported\n\n8\n\n\f[2-4,6,11,14,29] earlier which suggest to the high color purity and narrow size\ndistribution of the core/shell NPs.\n\nThe core/shell NPs are highly stable against\n\nphotooxidation as confirmed from the exposure of the NPs to UV light for 2 hours. We\nobserved no change in the FL shape, width or position. Our experimental observation lead\nto the conclusion that to achieve intense luminescence from different choice of core/shell\nmaterials (i) the lattice mismatch between the core and the shell should be minimum, (ii)\nthe core should be small with large curved surface, (iii) good crystallinity of the core and\n\n1.2\n0.8\n0.4\n0.0\n\nInset I\n\n376\n374\n\n1.5\n\n372\n\n1.0\n\n370\n\n0.5\n\n80\n\n\uf044PL (%)\n\n1.6\n\n2.0\n\nPeak Position (nm)\n\nPL Intensity (arb. unit)\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n60\n40\n20\n\n368\n70 140 210 280 350\nT e m p.

Hence, for such a temperature sensor application, the PL of the core/shell in thin\nfilm form on a glass substrate was probed in the temperature cycle 80k to 370K. The\ntemperature was cycled from low to high and then back to low several times to test the\nreversibility of PL yield. The excitation wavelength was 250nm and PL was recorded at\nsteady state condition at each temperature. The evolution of PL spectra as a function of\ntemperature is shown in figure 3. Note that, two and half times increase of PL intensity at\n80K as compared to 300K is observed due to the suppression of phonon vibration. Here,\nthe ambient temperature is 300K. Below 300K, the PL is blue shifted and a maximum\nshift of 8nm occur at 80K. Above 300K, PL is red shifted and a maximum red shift of\nabout 2nm occurs at 370K. Overall, the PL is red shifted with increasing temperature due\nto thermal expansion of lattice leading to band gap narrowing [45]. In addition, with\nincreasing temperature, the PL is consistently quenched. The quenching of PL at high\ntemperature is ascribed to the escape of carriers from the nanocrystals to the non-radiative\nrecombination centers [46]. The PL position and intensity as a function of temperature is\nshown in figure 3(inset I) exhibit a linear trend. In terms of rate processes competing for\ndeactivation of the lower excited singlet state under given conditions of temperature and\ndielectric, the PL yield can be expressed [47] as \uf066y=kf / kf + \uf053kd, where kf is the rate\nconstant of PL and \uf053kd is the sum of the rate constants for deactivation of the lowest\nexcited singlet state by all competitive non-radiative processes. From the relation, as \uf053kd\nincreases, \uf066y will decrease with increase of temperature. Indeed, with the increase of\ntemperature, the deep traps became more active and contribute to the non-radiative\nprocesses. Unlike the linear decrease of PL intensity (figure 3 inset I) with increasing\ntemperature, the red shift of PL peaks with increasing temperature is not linear. The PL\nshift generally depend upon inter dipole-dipole interaction [47] which possibly is not the\nsame for all the temperature under investigation. As the core/shell was intended to be\n\n10\n\n\fused as a temperature sensor, a calibration curve was plotted with change of PL with\nincreasing temperature with the 80K as the reference. Such a calibration plot is shown in\nfigure 3(inset II) in the temperature range of 80K to 370K. Linearity in the sensor\ncalibration could be attained with a sensor resolution of -0.312% per deg.K which is\nslightly less than the reported result [14] whose temperature range is only 315K to 100K.\nEven the change in PL peak position with temperature is less than the reported results\n[14]. Such a sensor resolution with wide temperature range suggests that lattice matched\nand highly stable HgTe/CdTe core/shell NPs can be used as one of best temperature\nsensors. Figure 3(inset III) shows the Stern-Volmer plot [48] with linearity in the\ntemperature range of 80K to 370K. The linearity and KSV= 4 X 10-4 suggest dynamic\nquenching of PL with temperature.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the fabrication of highly stable narrow size\ndistributed and lattice matched HgTe/CdTe core/shells whose luminescence yield at 300K\nis much higher than any of the lattice mismatched strained core/shells. The colour purity\nof such core/shell structures is excellent. A clear core/shell interface can easily be\nidentified and the strain relaxation at the curved surface of the shell without affecting the\ncore has been proposed. The FL shows excitonic recombination associated with large\nStokes shift. As the core/shells are photo stable and highly stable in the ambient, a\ntemperature sensor have been fabricated with relatively high resolution (-0.32% per\ndeg.K) in the wider temperature range, 80K to 370K. The possible and immediate\napplication of such core/shell structures lies with multiplex biolabeling because of the\nhydrophilic LEEH capping, luminescence thermometry and electroluminescence devices.\nMethods:\nThe LEEH capped HgTe/CdTe core/shell nanoparticles have successfully been\nsynthesized in a simple two step chemical reaction. The precursor's mercury chloride\n\n11\n\n\f(HgCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4) and tellurium powder (Te), reducing agent sodium\nborohydride (NaBH4) and the capping materials LEEH, all 99.9% pure, are used as\nreceived. In all the steps, double distilled deionized water is used as the solvent. LEEH, a\nderivative of protein amino acid that exists naturally as a protein in most living\norganisms, is a hydrophilic surface passivating agent and do not show any absorption or\nemission in the UV-Vis region of our interest. The synthesis of HgTe is carried out as\nfollows: 0.32mM of tellurium powder was reduced by 1mM sodium borohydride in water\nwhich produces NaHTe. To this, a solution of LEEH capped Hg (0.32mM) solution was\nadded and stirred for 4 hours at 900C to synthesize LEEH capped HgTe nanoparticles.\nThe amount of capping agent LEEH was varied to 10, 15 and 20 times of the molar\nconcentration Hg (3.2, 4.8 and 6.4 mM) to study the effect of capping agent on size and\noptical properties of the nanocomposites. In the second step, the formation of the shell\nwas carried out to a portion of the LEEH capped HgTe as follows: 0.16mM solution of\nreduced tellurium powder (NaHTe) was added to water dispersed HgTe and stirred for 2\nhours to make the surface of HgTe NPs Te rich to which stock solution of cadmium\n(0.16mM) was added for the formation of CdTe shell over the HgTe core. The CdTe shell\nwas grown epitaxially over the HgTe core without conventional substitution reaction with\neither anion or cation. For temperature dependent PL measurements, a thin film of the\ncore/shell nanocomposite is prepared by drop casting of NP dispersion on a cleaned glass\nsubstrate and dried under ambient. The X-ray diffraction of the NPs is carried out with a\nBruker Advanced D8 GXRD. A 200 kV JEOL-2010 HRTEM fitted with a cooled CCD\ncamera (Gatan) was used for the electron microscopy studies. The UV-Vis spectra of the\nNPs were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrophotometer. The FL and PL\nbehavior of the NPs in water dispersed state and in thin film form are recorded at room as\nwell as controlled temperature using Oriel PL set-up with a PMT detector. The capping of\n\n12\n\n\fthe HgTe/CdTe core/shells by LEEH is confirmed from FTIR measurements (supporting\ninformation).\nThe LEEH capped HgTe/CdTe core/shell NPs are stable in the ambient even after\n5 months as evidenced from their unchanged spectral shape and width in their absorption\nand fluorescence measurements. The photo stability test of the HgTe/CdTe core/shell NPs\nare carried out under 200mw/cm2 intensity of illumination from a Hg-Xe lamp using a\nwater filter to avoid the heating effect. The absorption and FL measurements at 300K\nexhibited no noticeable change after the continuous light exposure to the core/shell\nstructures which establishes the high photo stability of the materials.\nAcknowledgement: Authors would like to thank Prof. P.V.
