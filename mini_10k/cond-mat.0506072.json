The\ngiant magnetoresistance (GMR) in these systems have\nbeen explained by elastic scattering of the conduction\nelectrons on magnetic moments of differently aligned\nmagnetic entities. Gittleman et al. have shown that\nin superparamagnetic granular alloys this consideration leads to a magnetoresistance proportional to the\nsquare of the magnetization.7 Deviations from this relation has been attributed to the size distribution of the\nmagnetic scatterers.8,9 and interactions between these\nscatterers10,11,12 Various assumptions on the form of the\nsize distribution have been made in order to obtain a\nphenomenological description of the GMR phenomena in\ndifferent granular systems.\nIn this paper we present a systematical study of\nthe magnetic and magnetotransport properties of vacuum evaporated granular Fe-Ag structures. The observed large, negative non-saturating magnetic field dependence and the unusual sublinear temperature dependence (d2 R/dT 2 < 0) of the resistivity have been analyzed simultaneously. This allowed the separation of\nthe various scattering processes and the identification of\ntwo characteristic grain size determining the macroscopic\nmagnetic and transport properties without making any\nassumption on the grain size distribution.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nThe Fe-Ag multilayer samples were prepared by\nsequential vacuum evaporation in a base pressure of\n10\u22127 Pa onto Si(1 1 1) single crystal substrates at room\ntemperature. The mass of the deposited material was\nmeasured by a quartz oscillator and the nominal layer\nthickness was calculated using the bulk density of Fe and\nAg. In this paper specimens prepared with the following\n\nsequences are discussed:\n(A) [Ag(2.6nm)/Fe(0.2nm)]75 /Ag(2.6nm)\n(B) [Ag(1.3nm)/Fe(0.2nm)]75 /Ag(1.3nm)\n(C) [Ag(0.8nm)/Fe(0.2nm)]75 /Ag(0.8nm)\nStructural characterization of the samples by X-ray\ndiffraction indicated a nanometer scale grain size of the\nconstituents [for details see Ref. 13], however, due to\nthe strong overlap between the diffraction lines of bccFe and fcc-Ag, a quantitative evaluation of the size of\nthe magnetic Fe grains was not possible. The absence\nof peaks of the X-ray reflectivity13 when the Fe layer\nthickness is less than \u2248 1 nm is attributed to discontinuities of the Fe layers. This limit of the continuous layer\nregime is quite similar to that observed in other multilayer systems14,15,16 composed of transition metals with\nimmiscible nonmagnetic elements and these kind of discontinuous multilayers are often referred to as granular\nmultilayers17. The relation between the size of the grains\nin granular multilayers and the nominal layer thickness\nis generally determined by a three-dimensional growth\nprocess18 and the average diameter of the grains can be\nmuch larger than the nominal layer thickness. It depends\non the material parameters (e.g. lattice parameter mismatch, surface energy, etc.), as well as various parameters (deposition rate, substrate temperature, etc.) of the\ndeposition technique. The decrease of the spacer layer\nthickness was found19 to increase the magnetic grain size\nin an other series of Fe/Ag granular multilayer samples.\nThe magnetic structure of the samples was examined by a superconducting quantum interference device\n(SQUID) and by transmission M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy.\nFor the latter purpose the samples have been removed\nfrom the substrate and folded up to achieve an appropriate thickness for transmission measurements.\nThe largest GMR and the strongest magnetic scattering of the conduction electrons were observed in sample\nA, as it will be shown later. The 57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectra\nof this sample taken at several temperatures are shown\nin Fig. 1.

The low temperature spectra\nshow that the sample is superparamagnetic (SPM) and\nas the magnetic clusters gradually freeze below the blocking temperature (around 50K), the six-line pattern characteristic to the Zeeman splitting of the nuclear levels\nof 57 Fe appears. At T = 4.2 K the paramagnetic fraction is absent, but the spectral lines are much broader\nand the hyperfine parameters are different than those of\nbulk bcc-Fe. The 4.2 K spectrum could be fitted with a\ndistribution of hyperfine fields21 with an average value,\nHav = 34.7 T and standard deviation \u03c3H =2.4 T.\nIt is worth noting that the intensity ratios of the six\nlines indicate a significant spontaneous alignment of the\nmagnetic moments. The intensity of the six lines of a\nsextet is distributed as 3 : I2\u22125 : 1 : 1 : I2\u22125 : 3, where\nI2\u22125 = 4 sin 2\u0398/(1 + cos 2\u0398) is the intensity of the m = 0\ntransitions, and \u0398 is the angle between the direction of\nthe gamma-ray (perpendicular to the sample plane) and\nthe magnetic moment. In case of a random distribution of the magnetization directions I2\u22125 = 2. The observed small intensity, I2\u22125 = 0.5, indicates a close-toperpendicular alignment of the magnetic moments with\n\nFIG. 2: Zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetization of samples A, B and C as a function of temperature\n[panels (a), (b) and (c) respectively].\n\nrespect to the sample plane. Applying a magnetic field\nperpendicular to the sample plane could fully align the\nmoments parallel to the field, as it is indicated by the\nI2\u22125 = 0 intensity.\nThe spectra measured in external magnetic field were\nalso fitted with a distribution of the hyperfine fields and\nthe parameters obtained are: Hav = 32.5 and 27.8 and\n\u03c3H = 2.3 and 2.4 T for Bext = 3 and 7 T. The external\nmagnetic field does not affect the width of the distribution indicating that it is not due to relaxation of the\nmagnetic moments. The broad spectral lines of the observed sextet result from a distribution of the Fe neighborhoods, which can be due both to the large number\nof surface atoms in small grains and to non-equilibrium\nmixing of the elements22 during the growth process. The\nfield-independent width and the decrease of the observed\naverage hyperfine field in external field indicate the ferromagnetic alignment of the magnetic grains. The hyperfine field of a ferromagnet is decreased by the applied\nfield, since it is oriented antiparallel to the magnetic moment. We note that at 4.2 K the statistical errors allow\nan SPM fraction containing less than 2 atomic % of the\nFe atoms.\nThe freezing of the superparamagnetic moments \u2013 seen\nin the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra \u2013 also appears in the temperature dependence of the low field susceptibility measured\nby the SQUID.

The blocking temperatures of\nabout 40, 150 and 300 K for samples A, B and C, respectively can be deduced from this experiment. Sample A\n(TB = 40 K) exhibits a textbook example for the superparamagnetic behavior. The maximum of the ZFC curve\nis more smeared out for samples B and C and in case of\nsample B the irreversibility temperature, where the FC\ncurve starts to deviate from the ZFC one, is much larger\nthan the TB defined by the ZFC maximum. Such features are generally explained23,24 as the effect of a grain\nsize distribution and interaction among the magnetic particles, which obviously play a role as the average grain\nsize and the concentration of the magnetic component\nincrease.\nThe magnetization versus applied magnetic field curves\nof sample A are shown in Fig. 3 up to B = 5 T at four different temperatures. Above the blocking temperature the\nmagnetization can quite well be described25 by a single\nLangevin function, as expected for a superparamegnetic\nsystem of uniform grains. The average magnetic moment\nof the SPM grains deduced from the fit is \u03bcG = 500 \u03bcB .\nIt indicates that the bulk magnetic properties are mainly\ndetermined by the average size grains (about 1.8 nm) and\nthe effect of the size distribution is negligible.\nThe magnetotransport measurements have been performed in the current in plane arrangement by four contact method. The coincidence of the parallel (H k I)\nand transversal (H \u22a5 I) magnetoresistance and the absence of any anisotropic component is characteristic to\nthe GMR phenomenon in granular systems4 . The temperature dependence of the resistivity of samples A \u2013\nC in zero and 12 T magnetic field normalized to their\nT = 290 K values are displayed in Fig. 4. Contrary to ordinary metallic systems, the resistivity is sublinear above\n40 K for each sample.

As discussed later in detail,\nthe above qualitative feature of the zero field temperature dependencies signifies the presence of an extremely\nstrong magnetic scattering in our samples.\nThe anomalous character of the \u03c1(T ) curves is the most\ndominant in case of sample A. Simultaneously, this sample exhibits the largest magnetoresistance at low temperature, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 5. The\nmagnitude of the GMR measured at T = 4.2 K in a field\nof B = 12 T is 26 %, 18 % and 16 %, for samples A, B\nand C, respectively. Note that at room temperature this\norder is reversed.\nThe magnetoresistance curves of the three samples\nhave a common feature, they do not saturate even in\nhigh magnetic fields and at low temperatures, where the\nmagnetization seems already to be saturated. This indicates that significant magnetic scattering takes place\nat magnetic entities much smaller than the typical grain\nsize which determines the macroscopic magnetization. It\nis well known that the scattering amplitude of ferromagnetic grains embedded in a nonmagnetic metallic matrix is size dependent and the contribution of the smaller\nclusters is strongly enhanced.5 The magnetic moments of\nthese smaller clusters are harder to rotate by an applied\nmagnetic field thus the saturation of the magnetoresistance is slower than that of the net magnetization arising\n\n\f4\n\n[U(B) - U(0)] / U(0)\n\n0.00\n\nT = 290 K\n\n-0.04\n\nA\n-0.08\n\n-0.12\n0.00\n\n[U(B) - U(0)] / U(0)\n\n(a)\n\nB\n\nC\nT = 4.2 K\n\n(b)\n\n-0.08\n\nC\n-0.16\n\nB\n-0.24\n\nA\n-12\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\nMagnetic field (T)\nFIG. 5: Magnetoresistivity of samples A \u2013 C up to 12 T magnetic field at room temperature (a) and T = 4.2 K (b).\n\ndominantly from the larger grains. Note that similar behavior was found found in Fe-Ag co-deposited granular\nfilms26 as well as in many other systems (for a review\nsee27 ). In the next section we give a more detailed analysis of the above qualitative picture.\n\nIII.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIn order to identify the resistivity contribution of\nthe magnetic scattering process we assume that the\nMatthiessen-rule can be applied, i.e the resistivity is composed of 3 terms:\n\u03c1(T, B) = \u03c10 + \u03c1ph (T ) + \u03c1magn (T, B) .\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u03c10 denotes the residual resistivity, \u03c1ph (T ) is the contribution arising from the phonon scattering, and the remaining part is attributed to the magnetic scattering.\nThe separation of the latter term requires further assumptions.\nInstead of making assumption on the shape of the grain\nsize distribution function8,9 we use physical considerations to get insight into the size distribution of the grains\ndetermining the magnetic scattering. It is based on the\nanalysis of the temperature dependence of the resistivity\nmeasured in zero and high magnetic field, as shown in\nFigs. 6 and 7. In these limits the large grains \u2013 which\n\ndominate the bulk magnetic properties \u2013 do not give temperature dependent contribution to the magnetic scattering, as the system is either nonmagnetic (zero field limit,\nabove the blocking temperature) or fully polarized ferromagnetically (high field limit). We will see that the\nsmall clusters can also be characterized by a single average size, and in high fields the temperature dependence\nof the magnetic scattering is determined solely by this\ncharacteristic size: the magnetic moment of these small\nclusters is the only fitting parameter for the calculated\ncurves describing the shapes of \u03c1magn (T, B = 12T) shown\nin Fig. 8. Finally, the consistency of our analysis will also\nbe demonstrated by evaluating the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity in the whole magnetic field range\n(Fig. 9) using the characteristic sizes determined independently from the magnetization data and the temperature dependence of the resistivity in the zero and high\nfield limits.\nIn a granular system the magnetic scattering depends\non the correlation between the localized magnetic moments of the grains, h~\n\u03bci ~\u03bcf i, while a conduction electron\nis scattered from ~\u03bci to ~\u03bcf within its spin-diffusion length7 .\nIn zero magnetic field, well above the blocking temperature the magnetic moments of the grains (including the\nlarge grains) are fully disordered. In these circumstances\nno temperature dependence is expected from the magnetic scattering, at least until the spin diffusion length\nis large enough. We assume that at high temperatures\nthe temperature dependence of the resistivity arise solely\nfrom the phonon contribution,\n\u0012 \u00133 Z \u0398/T 2\nT\nx dx\n\u03c1ph (T ) = a1\n.\n(2)\n\u0398\nex \u2212 1\n0\nAs the the phonon term is linear above the Debye temperature (\u0398 \u2248 210 K)6 , the strength of phonon scattering, a1 , can be determined from the high temperature\nslope of the zero field resistivity curves. The calculated\n\u03c1ph (T ) curves are shown in Fig. 6 by dashed lines for the\n3 samples. The difference of the total resistivity and\nits phonon related part is attributed to the magnetic\nscattering, and \u03c10 + \u03c1magn (T, 0) is displayed in Fig. 6\nby dotted lines for each sample. As it was expected,\nthe magnetic scattering is temperature independent at\nhigh temperatures and the lower the blocking temperature the wider is the flat part of the separated magnetic\ncontribution curve. It is also seen that the magnetic\nscattering gradually decreases as the blocking temperature is approached from above. Note, however, that at\nT = 4.2 K there is still a considerable contribution from\nit, i.e. \u03c1(T = 4.2K, B = 0T) 6= \u03c1(T = 4.2K, B = 12T) as\nit can be seen from Fig. 4.\nSince the phonon term is magnetic field independent,\nthe \u03c1ph (T ) curves determined from the zero field temperature dependencies can be used to separate the magnetic scattering contribution in the high field measurements. This is shown in Fig. 7 for the B = 12 T measurements.

The good agreement of\nthe experimental and the calculated curves indicates that\nthe size distribution of these clusters is negligible. The\nfitted values are in the same order of magnitude for all\nthe samples; S = 16.6 \u03bcB , 17 \u03bcB and 12.5 \u03bcB for samples\nA \u2013 C respectively.\nNext we discuss the magnetic field dependence of the\nresistivity of sample A, which exhibits the strongest magnetic scattering in the superparamagnetic state, where\nthe process of magnetic saturation is well understood.\nFor a numerical analysis we use the two characteristic\nsizes determined from the previous experiments. The\nLangevin fit to the magnetization experiments performed\nin the superparamagnetic temperature range has shown\nthe presence of large grains with \u03bcG \u2248 500 \u03bcB (Fig. 3),\nwhile the temperature dependence of the resistivity in\nhigh magnetic field indicated the presence of small clusters with S \u2248 17 \u03bcB . Following Gittleman's model7 we\ndescribe the magnetoresistance by the field dependence of\nthe correlation between the localized magnetic moments\nresponsible for an initial and a final magnetic scattering\nprocess:\nE\nED\nD\n\u2206\u03c1\n~ .\n~\n\u03bcf B\n~\n\u221d h~\n\u03bci ~\n\u03bcf i \u221d ~\n\u03bci B\n\u03c1\n\n(4)\n\nFIG. 9: Magnetoresistivity of sample A in the superparamagnetic range, at room temperature. The open symbols are\nexperimental data, the solid line is the fit according to Eq. 5.\nThe dashed and dash-dotted curves correspond to the first\nand second terms of Eq. 5, respectively. The magnetic moments of the clusters and the grains were taken from independent experiments, see text for details.\n\nIn case of the observed two largely different grain sizes\nthis can be expressed as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206\u03c1\n\u03bcB\n\u03bcB\n\u2212 b2 L\nBS (B, T )\n= \u2212b1 L2\n\u03c1\nkT\nkT\n\u2212b3 BS2 (B, T )\n\n(5)\n\nwhere BS = hSz i /S is the Brillouin-function defined\nunder Eq. 3 for the small iron clusters and L(x) =\ncoth x \u2212 1/x is the Langevin-function, i.e. the classical\nlimit of BS for the large Fe grains. The parameters b1 , b2\nand b3 represent the relative weights of scattering from\ngrain to grain, between a grain and a cluster and from\ncluster to cluster.\nFigure 9 shows magnetoresistance for sample A in the\nsuperparamagnetic phase and the expected variation calculated by Eq. 5. The two characteristic magnetic moments (\u03bcG = 500 \u03bcB and S = 17 \u03bcB ) are determined in\nthe previous analysis from independent experiments: the\nfield and temperature dependence of the bulk magnetization, and the temperature dependence of the resistivity. The relative weights of the various processes were\nused as fitting parameters: b1 = 0.035, b2 = 0.013 and\nb3 = 0.0001. The value of b1 , i.e the relatively weight for\nthe grain\u2192grain scattering process is larger than b2 , even\nthough the amplitude of the grain scattering is small.5 It\nreflects the large probability of scattering from grain to\ngrain due to the large volume fraction of this type of magnetic scatterer. The direct interplay between the clusters\n\n\f7\nis negligible, as expected for a small fraction (less than\n2 %).\nIn Fig. 9 the dashed and the dashed-dotted lines represents the contribution of the two dominant scattering\nprocesses. The grain\u2192grain scattering process is the\nleading term in Eq. 5 up to 4 T magnetic field. The\ndashed line corresponds to the square of the magnetization, and if this would be the only scattering process\nthe simple relation7 of \u2206R(B) \u221d M 2 would hold. Above\nB = 4 T, however, the second term of Eq. 5 dominates\nand the observed behavior can be attributed to the effect of the small clusters, not seen in the magnetization\ncurves. The good description of the measured magnetization and resistance curves by two characteristic sizes\nis the consequence of the narrow size distributions of the\ngrains and the clusters.\nBimodal distribution of the grain size has already\nbeen observed in granular systems prepared by codeposition10,28,29 , rapid quenching from the melt,30 , or\nlayered growth31,32 of the constituents. Since for our\nsamples a non-saturating magnetoresistance indicates the\npresence of small clusters even in case of 25 nm thick\ncontinuous Fe layers33 , we associate the large grains and\nthe small culsters to Fe rich grains of the granular layers and small Fe clusters trapped inside the Ag layers,\nrespectively. Intermixing of the layers can occur during the sample growth even when the heat of mixing is\npositive22 , like in the case of Fe and Ag. On the other\nhand, the tendency for non-equilibrium mixing does not\nseem to depend on the sample preparation method, since\nthe magnetoresistance and the magnetic properties of our\ngranular multilayers are very similar to those observed in\nco-depositied26,34 samples.\nIn our case for sample A the magnetic moments of\nthe large grains and the small clusters differ more than\nan order of magnitude; \u03bcG =500 \u03bcB , and S \u2248 17 \u03bcB . According to the M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy measurements the\nsmall clusters contain only a small fraction (below 2 %)\nof the magnetic atoms. This explains why the bulk magnetization is determined by the properties of the large\ngrains at all temperatures, while in the transport prop-\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nM. N.

Interactions between\nthe grains are also likely to play a role11 as the Fe concentration increases. However, the temperature dependence\nof the resistivity measured in 12 T magnetic field is\nquite similar to that observed in sample A (see Fig. 4)\nand the analysis of the magnetic scattering contribution\n(Fig. 8) undoubtedly indicates that there is a significant\ncontribution from small clusters in these samples, as well.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn conclusion, we investigated the magnetic scattering processes in sequentially evaporated granular Fe-Ag\nfilms. Unusual magnetotransport features \u2013 like sublinear temperature dependence of the resistivity over a wide\ntemperature range both in zero and 12 T magnetic fields\nand large, non saturating GMR \u2013 were found experimentally. The contribution of the magnetic scattering was\nseparated and analyzed. The quantitative description\nsuggests a granular system with bimodal size distribution\nof the magnetic components: coexisting large grains and\nsmall clusters. A detailed numerical analysis was given to\ndetermine characteristic grain- and cluster-moments, and\ntheir influence on both the scattering processes and on\nthe macroscopic magnetization. The analysis reveals that\nscattering on the small clusters plays a dominant role in\nhigh magnetic fields over a wide temperature range.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nFinancial support of the Hungarian Research Founds\nOTKA TS049881, T034602 and T038383 are acknowledged.\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nPhys.
