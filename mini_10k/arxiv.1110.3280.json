I NTRODUCTION\nA Poisson point process has been adopted in the literature for the locations of nodes in the\nstudy of shotgun cellular networks, ad-hoc networks, and other uncoordinated and decentralized\ncommunication networks [1], [2, and references therein]. An underlying assumption in all the\nprevious work is that the density of transmitters, referred to as base station (BS) throughout\nthis paper, is constant, i.e. the Poisson point process is homogeneous. Such a model does not\nsufficiently represent reality.\nIn [2] and here, we have modeled BS arrangement by non-homogeneous Poisson point pro\u0001\ncesses in Rl , l = 1, 2, and 3. We aim to characterize carrier-to-interference ratio CI at a given\nP. Madhusudhanan, Y. Liu, and T. X. Brown are with the Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering\nDepartment; J. G.

In [2], we have derived semi-analytical expressions for the tail probability\n\b\n\u0001\nof CI , denoted as P CI > y , by deriving the characteristic function of the reciprocal of CI .\nMoreover, the\n\nC\nI\n\ncharacterization holds for a wide range of scenarios of interest such as arbitrary\n\ndistributions for fading and random BS transmission powers, arbitrary path-loss models and\narbitrary locations for the MS. In spite of such a general result, it is still not convenient to\ncompare the\n\nC\nI\n\ndistributions of two different networks.\n\nIs it possible to qualitatively compare two\nwithout having to obtain the\n\nC\nI\n\nC\nI\n\ndistributions by only examining the BS densities\n\ndistributions? This paper answers the question affirmatively\n\nfor certain BS densities by developing a stochastic ordering based tool. Concepts of stochastic\nordering have been applied to scenarios of interest in wireless communications in [3]. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first work that uses stochastic ordering to understand large scale\nrandom wireless networks. The main result of this paper is Theorem 1 for which Section III\ndevelops the necessary tools. The utility of this result is explored in Section IV, by considering\nseveral scenarios of interest in modeling the wireless network.\nII. S YSTEM M ODEL\nThe Shotgun Cellular System (SCS) is a model for the cellular system in which the BSs\nare distributed in a l-dimensional plane (l\u2212D, typically l = 1, 2, and 3) according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson point process in Rl . The intensity function of the Poisson point process\nis called the BS density function.\nWithout loss of generality, we restrict our attention to 1-D SCSs, because for the\n\nC\nI\n\nanalysis,\n\nthe l-D SCSs can be reduced to an equivalent 1-D SCS [2, Lemma 2] with a BS density function\n\u03bb(r), where r \u2265 0 is the distance of the BS from a mobile-station (MS) located at the origin.\nFor example, a homogeneous l-D SCS with density \u03bb0 (> 0) is equivalent to a 1-D SCS with\ndensity function \u03bb (r) = \u03bb0 bl r l\u22121 , r \u2265 0, b1 = 2, b2 = 2\u03c0, and b3 = 4\u03c0 [2, Corollary 1].\nThe BSs are assumed to have independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random transmission powers Ki 's and shadow fadings \u03a8i 's across BSs. The deterministic path-loss is R\u2212\u03b5 , \u03b5 > 0.\nWe assume an interference limited system and omit background noise. We focus on the signal\nquality of a MS at the origin. The MS chooses to communicate with the BS that corresponds\nto the strongest received signal power, referred to as the \"serving BS\". All other BSs are the\n\"interfering BSs\". The signal quality at the MS is measured by\nSeptember 24, 2018\n\nC\nI\n\n=\n\nKS \u03a8S R\u2212\u03b5\nS\nP\u221e\n\u2212\u03b5 ,\ni=1 Ki \u03a8i Ri\n\nwhere S\nDRAFT\n\n\f3\n\nindexes the serving BS and i indexes the interfering BSs. Further, RS \u2264 R1 \u2264 R2 \u2264 * * * are\nordered BS locations.\nIII. T HE S TOCHASTIC O RDERING\n\nOF C\nI\n\nIn this section, we present the theoretical tools that are used to compare\n\nC\nI\n\ntail probability by\n\ncomparing the equivalent 1-D BS densities \u03bb(r). Since the effect of i.i.d. shadow fading factors\nand i.i.d. transmission powers can be captured by modifying the BS density as shown in Section\nIV-D, they are assumed to be 1 for all BSs. The generalization to arbitrary path loss model is\ngiven in [2, Section VI], which is also equivalent to modifying \u03bb(r). As a result,\n\nC\nI\n\n=\n\nR\u2212\u03b5\nP\u221e 1 \u2212\u03b5 .\ni=2 Ri\n\nDefinition 1. Let X and Y be two random variables such that P ({X > x}) \u2264 P ({Y > x}) , \u2200 x \u2208\n(\u2212\u221e, \u221e), then X is smaller than Y in the usual stochastic order and this is denoted by X \u2264st Y .\nFurther, X =st Y means P ({X > x}) = P ({Y > x}) , \u2200 x \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) . [4, p. 3]\nIf X and Y are the\n\nC\nI\n\nat the MS in two different SCSs, X \u2264st Y implies that the MS in\n\nthe SCS corresponding to Y is more likely to achieve better signal quality than in the SCS\ncorresponding to X.\nLet {Rk }\u221e\nk=1 represent the set of distances of BSs from the MS (indexed in the ascending\norder of the distance), Dk+1 = Rk+1 \u2212 Rk be the distance between two adjacent BSs, and\nfDk+1 |Rk ( d| r; \u03bb(s)) be the probability density function (p.d.f.) of Dk+1 conditioned on Rk = r,\nas a function of the BS density \u03bb(s).\nLemma 1.\nfDk+1 |Rk (d |r; \u03bb(s) ) = e\u2212\n\n \u0301 r+d\n\n\u03bb(s)ds\n\n\u03bb(r + d), and\n\u0012\n\u0010s\u0011\u0013\n\u2032 1\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\nfaDk+1 |aRk (d |r ; \u03bb(s) ) = fDk+1 |Rk d r ; \u03bb\n.\na\na\nr\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nProof: Equation (1) follows from the properties of Poisson processes [5], \u0012\n[6].

The distribution of\n\nC\nI\n\nat the MS in the 1-D SCS with BS density function \u03bb(r) is\n\nthe same as that in 1-D SCSs with BS density functions a1 \u03bb( ar ), \u2200 a > 0, i.e.,\n\nC\nI \u03bb(r)\n\n=st\n\nC\nI\n\n1\n\u03bb( ar )\na\n\n.\n\nProof: Let {Rk }\u221e\nk=1 correspond to the 1-D SCS with BS density function \u03bb(r). Then, since\nthe ordered BS locations Rk 's are determined\nby inter-BS distances, it follows from Lemma\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u2032\n\n1 that\n\nC\nI \u03bb(r)\n\n=\n\n(aR1 )\u2212\u03b5\nP\u221e\n\u2212\u03b5\nk=2 (aRk )\n\n\u03bb(r)\n\n=st\n\nR1\n\n\u2212\u03b5\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032 \u2212\u03b5\nk=2 Rk\n\nP\u221e\n\n( )\n\n, where Rk 's corresponding to a1 \u03bb( ar )\n\n1\n\u03bb( ar )\na\n\nhave the same distribution as aRk 's with \u03bb(r).\n\u0001\n\b\nAs a result, a1 \u03bb ar , r \u2265 0, a > 0 forms a parametric family of BS density functions\nsuch that the 1-D SCSs corresponding to them have the same\n\nC\nI\n\nat the MS. In other words,\n\nappropriately scaling the BS density function will not change the p.d.f. of\n\nC\n.\nI\n\nMoreover, the\n\nfollowing special case is a direct corollary of the above result.\nCorollary 2. In a homogeneous l-D SCS,\nProof: Firstly, recall that the\n\nC\nI\n\nC\nI\n\nis not a function of the BS density.\n\nat the MS in a homogeneous l\u2212D SCS with BS density\n\n\u03bb0 is the same as that in a 1\u2212D SCS with a BS density function \u03bb (r) = \u03bb0 bl r l\u22121 . Next, from\nCorollary 1, the distribution of CI in this SCS is the same as that in a 1-D SCS with the BS\n\u0001\ndensity function a1 \u03bb ar = \u03bb0 \u03b1bl r l\u22121 , \u03b1 = a\u2212l , a > 0. Thus, distributions of CI corresponding\n\nto \u03b1\u03bb0 and \u03bb0 are the same.\n\nThis was also observed in [2], where we showed that the expression for the characteristic\n\u0001\u22121\nfunction of CI\ndid not involve \u03bb0 . Corollary 2 provides a simpler and more fundamental\n\nproof. Next, we define a notation used in Theorem 1.\n\nDefinition 2. For BS density function \u03bb (r), the cumulative BS density function is defined as\n \u0301r\n\u03bc(r) , 0 \u03bb(s)ds, and its inverse function is define as \u03bc\u22121 (q) , sup{r : \u03bc(r) \u2264 q}.\nSince \u03bb(r) \u2265 0, \u03bc (r) is a monotonically increasing function of r. In general, the inverse\nfunction is not injective since \u03bb(r) can be zero in arbitrary intervals of r \u2208 [0, \u221e) . The above\ndefinition makes it injective. For certain BS densities, it is possible to compare two\n\nC\n's\nI\n\nby\n\ncomparing the densities without solving for the distributions. It is facilitated by Theorem 1.\n\b\n\b\n\u22121\nTheorem 1.

Shadow Fading and Random Transmission Powers\nIn all the results until now, the shadow fading factors and the transmission powers for all\nthe BSs were constant. Here, we generalize to the case when they are random variables, i.i.d.\nacross BSs. The transmission power and the shadow fading factor of the same BS could be\ndependent. The following result reduces the 1-D SCS with random shadow fading factors and\nrandom transmission powers to a 1-D SCS where both are 1.\nTheorem 2.

Theorem 1.A.3.(a) of [4] says that decreasing functions reverse stochastic order.\nTherefore, one only needs to show that the interferences satisfy\n\u221e\nX\n\nRk\u2212\u03b5 |R2 \u2265\u03bc\u22121\n2 (q),\n\n1\n\u03bb ( r ),\na 1 a\n\nr\u2265\u03bc\u22121\n2 (q)\n\nk=2\n\n\u2265st\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nRk\u2212\u03b5 |R2 \u2265\u03bc\u22121\n2 (q),\n\n.\n\u03bb2 (r), r\u2265\u03bc\u22121\n2 (q)\n\n(3)\n\nk=2\n\nAs shown in [2, Appendix B], the total interference power can be expressed as\nP\nlimrB \u2192\u221e limN \u2192\u221e N\ni=2 Xi , where Xi is a Bernoulli random variable defined by\nP ({ Xi = 0| R1 = r1 }) = pi , P\n\n\b\n\nXi = ri\u2212\u03b5 + o (\u2206r) R1 = r1\n\npi = \u03bb(ri )\u2206r + o(\u2206r), ri = r1 + (i \u2212 1)\u2206r, \u2206r =\n\nrB \u2212r1\n,\nN\n\n\u0001\n\nP\u221e\n\n\u2212\u03b5\nk=2 Rk\n\n=\n\n= 1 \u2212 pi ,\n\nand r1 = \u03bc\u22121\n2 (q).
