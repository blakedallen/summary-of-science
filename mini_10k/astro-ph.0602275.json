These\ndisks are thought to be highly turbulent due to the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We study\nwave excitation by MRI turbulence in the shearing box geometry. We demonstrate that axisymmetric\nsound waves and radial epicyclic motions driven by MRI turbulence give rise to narrow, distinct peaks\nin the temporal power spectrum. Inertial waves, on the other hand, do not give rise to distinct peaks\nwhich rise significantly above the continuum noise spectrum set by MRI turbulence, even when the\nfluid motions are projected onto the eigenfunctions of the modes. This is a serious problem for QPO\nmodels based on inertial waves.\nSubject headings: accretion, accretion disks - MHD - turbulence - waves - X-rays: binaries\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nMillisecond variability has been observed for some\ntime with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer in both\nneutron star and black hole binaries (e.g. McClintock & Remillard 2004, van der Klis 2004). In addition to a broad continuum in the power spectrum,\nQPOs are observed. These QPOs have been modeled\nas hydrodynamic waves in geometrically thin accretion\ndisks (for reviews see e.g. Wagoner 1999 and Kato\n2001), or \"torus-like\" flows with significant radial pressure gradients (Giannios & Spruit 2004; Rezzolla et al.\n2003; Klu\u017aniak et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2004; Blaes et.al.\n2006).\nTurbulence seeded by the magnetorotational instability (MRI; Balbus & Hawley 1991) is widely believed to\nprovide the stresses responsible for angular momentum\ntransport and accretion. This raises a series of questions. Do waves idealized as hydrodynamic perturbations\non a laminar background still exist in turbulent, magnetized accretion flows? Does the time-averaged flow act\nas a resonant cavity supporting standing waves? What\nis the steady-state wave amplitude due to turbulent excitation? The simplest and most controlled geometry to\nexplore these questions is that of the shearing box (e.g.\nHawley et al. 1995). One published attempt has been\nmade to look for discrete mode frequencies in a shearing\nbox MRI simulation (Brandenburg 2005), with negative\nresults (see figure 7 of that paper). Analytic estimates\nfor turbulent excitation of waves in accretion disks have\nbeen reported in Nowak & Wagoner (1993, 1995).\nWe revisit this problem, finding that MRI turbulence\ndoes indeed excite distinct peaks in the power spectrum,\nand that these peaks can be identified with certain classes\nof hydrodynamic modes, specifically axisymmetric acoustic waves and a global axisymmetric epicyclic oscillation.\nHydrodynamic inertial wave modes, however, are not\nclearly detected, a serious problem for QPO models that\n1 Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kohn Hall, University\nof California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106; arras@kitp.ucsb.edu\n2 Department of Physics, Broida Hall, University of California,\nSanta Barbara, CA 93106; blaes@physics.ucsb.edu\n3 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, MS 169-506, California Institute of\nTechnology, Pasadena, CA 91109; neal.turner@nasa.jpl.gov\n\nare based on these modes (\"g-modes\" in diskoseismology\nparlance).\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we\nreview the shearing box and compute the linear wave\nfrequencies. We present power spectra from numerical\nsimulations in section 3, and discuss the results. We\npresent our conclusions and discuss their relevance to\nmodels for QPOs in section 4.\n2. THE SHEARING BOX\n\nWe solve the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations\nas applied to an isothermal, differentially rotating, magnetized accretion disk, in the unstratified shearing box\napproximation:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nB2\n\u2202v\n(1)\n+ v * \u2207v + 2\u03a9 \u00d7 v = \u2212 \u2207 P +\n\u2202t\n\u03c1\n8\u03c0\nB * \u2207B\n+\n+ 2q\u03a92 xex\n(2)\n4\u03c0\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1v) = 0\n(3)\n\u2202t\n\u2202B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 (v \u00d7 B)\n(4)\n\u2202t\nP = c2s \u03c1.\n(5)\nHere \u03c1, P , v, and B are the mass density, gas pressure, velocity and magnetic field. The sound speed cs\nis constant. The simulation domain represents a small\nregion of the disk near the midplane orbiting with frequency \u03a9. The non-inertial reference frame of the orbit is taken into account by including a Coriolis force,\nas well as \"tidal\" forces due to the difference of gravitational and centrifugal forces, represented by the term\n2q\u03a92 xex , where q = \u2212d ln \u03a9/d ln R is the shear parameter. Cartesian coordinates are used, with the radial,\nazimuthal, and vertical coordinates labeled x, y, z, respectively. The azimuthal and vertical boundaries are\nperiodic, and the radial boundaries are shearing-periodic\n(fluid passing through one radial boundary appears on\nthe other at an azimuth that varies in time according to\nthe difference in orbital speed across the box).\nAn initially weak magnetic field will drive turbulence in\nthe shearing box due to the MRI, which is a nearly incom-\n\n\f2\npressible instability. A second branch of nearly incompressible perturbations which we call \"inertial waves\"\nalso exists, at least on a laminar background flow. In\nthe limit of zero magnetic field, the specific angular momentum gradient is the restoring force for these inertial\nwaves. To understand the two solutions with a simple\nexample, linearize about a time-independent background\nwith constant density \u03c1 and pressure P , constant magnetic field B = By ey + Bz ez , and velocity v = \u2212q\u03a9xey .\nFor incompressible, axisymmetric waves with space-time\ndependence exp(ikx x+ikz z\u2212i\u03c9t), the dispersion relation\nis (Balbus & Hawley 1991)\n\"\u0012\n#1/2\n\u00134\n2\nkz\n1 2 kz2 1\n2 2\n2 kz\n2\n2 2\n\u03ba\n+ 16kz vAz \u03a9 2\n,\n\u03c9 = kz vAz + \u03ba 2 \u00b1\n2 k\n2\nk\nk\n(6)\nwhere the positive sign gives inertial waves and the negative sign the MRI. Here vAz = Bz /(4\u03c0\u03c1)1/2 is the vertical\nAlfven speed and \u03ba = [2(2 \u2212 q)]1/2 \u03a9 is the fluid epicyclic\nfrequency.4 In the zero field limit, incompressible inertial\nwaves have the dispersion relation \u03c9 2 = \u03ba2 kz2 /k 2 .\nAlthough inertial modes modified by magnetic tension\nexist for the constant background chosen above, once the\nmedium becomes turbulent, their possible existence as\nnormal modes of oscillation becomes highly questionable.\nLow order inertial waves have frequencies of the same\norder as the energy-bearing MRI \"eddies\", and hence\nare susceptible to nonlinear interactions with the MRI\nturbulence.\nThe simulations described here have zero net magnetic\nflux in each direction. Furthermore, the time and spaceaveraged magnetic pressure is small. We attempt to understand waves in such a turbulent background by again\nlinearizing about a time-independent background with\nconstant density and pressure, velocity v = \u2212q\u03a9xey ,\nbut now including compressibility and neglecting magnetic fields. In this case, axisymmetric inertial-acoustic\nwaves satisfy the dispersion relation\ni1/2\n\u0001 1h 2\n\u00012\n1 2\n\u03ba + c2s k 2 \u00b1\n\u03ba + c2s k 2 \u2212 4\u03ba2 c2s kz2\n.\n\u03c92 =\n2\n2\n(7)\nFor zero wavenumber one recovers the fluid epicyclic\nmode \u03c9 2 = \u03ba2 . In the limit \u03ba2 \u226a c2s k 2 , which is a\ngood approximation even for the lowest wavenumbers\nin our simulations, inertial waves again have the dispersion relation \u03c9 2 = \u03ba2 kz2 /k 2 , while acoustic waves satisfy\n\u03c9 2 = c2s k 2 . In a shearing box of dimensions (Lx , Ly , Lz ),\nthese waves will occur at discrete frequencies because the\nwavenumbers will be quantized according to\nkx =\n\n2\u03c0nz\n2\u03c0nx\nand kz =\n,\nLx\nLz\n\n(8)\n\nwhere nx and nz are integers.\nBecause of the shearing boundary conditions, nonaxisymmetric waves in the shearing box have an\namplitude and frequency which change with time\n(Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965), and therefore do not\nexist as normal modes. The radial wavenumber changes\nwith time as kx (t) = kx\u2032 + q\u03a9(t \u2212 t0 )ky\u2032 , where kx\u2032 and\n4 Not to be confused with the epicyclic frequency of a particle\nin a gravitational field.\n\nky\u2032 are the wavenumbers with respect to comoving coordinates [x, y \u2032 = y + q\u03a9x(t \u2212 t0 )], and t0 is the time\nof minimum kx (t). When kx (t) \u223c kx\u2032 , non-axisymmetric\nwaves have similar frequencies to axisymmetric waves.\nFor kx (t) \u226b kx\u2032 , an approximate WKB dispersion relation for the time-dependent frequency is (see eq. 72 in\nGoldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965) \u03c9(t) \u2243 cs ky\u2032 q\u03a9t, showing\nthat the frequency changes on the shear timescale of the\ndisk. As kx (t) becomes large, eventually the wave will\ndamp away. If the wave has lifetime T , then we expect\nit to give rise to a broad peak in the power spectrum of\nwidth \u223c cky\u2032 q\u03a9T around the corresponding axisymmetric\nmode.\n3.\n\nPOWER SPECTRA\n\nOur simulations use box size (Lx , Ly , Lz ) = (1.25, 4, 1)\nwith (Nx , Ny , Nz ) = (40, 64, 32) grid points in each direction, respectively. The shear parameter q = 3/2, corresponding to Keplerian rotation. The net magnetic flux\nin each direction is zero and the initial weak field has\na spatial dependence given by B = B0 cos(2\u03c0x/Lx )ey +\nB0 sin(2\u03c0x/Lx )ez . The initial magnetic pressure is 400\ntimes less than the gas pressure. The sound speed, orbital frequency, and average density have the constant\nvalues cs = \u03a9 = 10\u22123 and \u03c1 = 1. The fiducial simulation\nis run for 1000 orbits. Averaged over time and the box,\nthe total magnetic pressure in the turbulence that results\nis 0.65% of the average gas pressure. However, there is\nsignificant variance, with small regions of local magnetic\npressure reaching 10% of the gas pressure.\nFigure 1 shows \"position space\" power spectra for density, radial velocity, and vertical velocity fluctuations.\nThree spectra are plotted for each. Data recorded at\na specific point (x, y, z) in the box contain fully nonaxisymmetric motions. Fluid motions with nodes along\nthe y-direction contain most of the power in MRI turbulence, hence we also record time series for azimuthally\naveraged data at the same (x, z) and box-averaged data\nin order to increase signal to noise for oscillatory modes.\nWe interpolated the data to uniform spacing in time,\npadded the array to a multiple of two, multiplied by\nthe Bartlett window function to reduce spectral leakage (Press et al. 1992), and used a Discrete Fast Fourier\nTransform to produce the power spectrum. The power\nspectra are normalized to the root-mean-square of the\ntime series. To produce figure 1 we binned the power\ninto 512 logarithmically spaced frequency bins in the frequency range shown. This has the effect of multiplying\nthe power spectrum by a factor of \u03c9. The frequency \u03c9/2\u03c0\nis expressed in units of inverse orbital time. Arrows show\nthe position of low order acoustic and inertial waves using eq. (7). While all three panels show curves for nonaxisymmetric and axisymmetric data, the box-averaged\npower is only visible in the plot for vx , appearing as a\nsharp peak at \u03c9 = \u03ba = \u03a9, the epicyclic frequency. This\nepicyclic mode has been reported in previous shearing\nbox simulations (Hawley et al. 1995). Numerical damping causes the sharp decline in power at high frequencies.\nIn runs at higher resolution, this dropoff was pushed to\nhigher frequencies, as expected.\nThe most striking feature in figure 1 is the axisymmetric sound waves, which appear as sharply defined peaks.\nThe power in these peaks approaches the broad continuum due to non-axisymmetric MRI turbulence, and\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 1.- \"Position space\" power spectrum for density (upper), radial velocity (middle), and vertical velocity fluctuations (lower). In\neach plot, the upper curve is for the non-axisymmetric data and the lower curve is for the axisymmetric data. The sharp peak at the orbital\nfrequency in the middle plot is the box averaged data. The frequency is in units of cycles per orbital period. Power has been rebinned into\nlogarithmically spaced frequency bins, which effectively multiplies the power spectrum by one power of frequency. Axisymmetric hydrodynamic normal mode frequencies from eq. (7) are shown as arrows. The epicyclic mode is at the orbital frequency (unity). Inertial modes\nand sound waves should lie below and above the epicyclic frequency, respectively. From right to left below the epicyclic frequency, arrows\nshow the expected axisymmetric inertial mode frequencies for (nx , nz ) = (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) and (5, 1). From left to right above\nthe epicyclic frequency, the axisymmetric acoustic waves have (nx , nz ) = (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (3, 0), (0, 3), (4, 0), and\n(5, 0), respectively.\n\nclearly rises above the continuum for at least two of the\npeaks. Axisymmetric sound waves with nz = 0 have\nmuch larger density and radial velocity fluctuations than\nthose with nx = 0. This is consistent with the larger continuum seen in vx relative to vz . A number of previous\ninvestigations (e.g. Stone et al. 1996; Gardiner & Stone\n2005) have noted non-axisymmetric sound waves in snapshots of the density profile. These non-axisymmetric\nsound waves also have nz = 0 and nx 6= 0, consistent\nwith our findings for axisymmetric waves.\nThere are no significant peaks observed for inertial\nmodes in figure 1. However, this is not proof of their\nnon-existence. The epicyclic mode was buried in the\nnoise for non-axisymmetric and axisymmetric data, and\nonly became visible by box-averaging. Moreover, the observable luminosity variation decreases strongly as wavelength decreases, due to averaging of hot and cold spots\n\non the disk. Hence large lengthscale, small power inertial modes may in principle be observable as compared\nto short lengthscale, large power MRI eddies. We now\nshow that this is in fact not the case.\nFigure 2 shows the \"momentum space\" power spectrum. Time series for azimuthally averaged vx and vz\nwere computed by taking spatial transforms in the x and\nz directions, for nx and nz nodes, respectively. Hence,\nturbulent eddies and inertial modes are on the same footing in this plot, as we compare their power at the same\nlengthscale. The temporal power spectrum for the resulting time series was computed as in figure 1 for 128\nfrequency bins in the range shown. The normalization of\nthe curves is such that the sum over all nx , nz , and frequency bins gives the root-mean-square of the time series\n(compare to axisymmetric curves in figure 1).\nThe epicyclic mode is again clearly visible in figure 2.\n\n\f4\n4.

Each curve is labelled by (nx , nz ) used for the spatial\nFourier transform. Power has been rebinned into logarithmically\nspaced frequency bins, which effectively multiplies the power spectrum by one power of frequency. Axisymmetric hydrodynamic\ninertial mode frequencies from eq. (7) are shown as arrows with\n(nx , nz ) = (0, 0), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1) from right to left.\n\nThe inertial modes are qualitatively different. Two of the\nlowest order modes show broak peaks of width \u03b4\u03c9 \u223c \u03c9 at\nthe expected frequencies. Without the analytic mode frequencies as a guide, it would be hard to recognize these\npeaks as significant. Higher order modes (not plotted\nhere) show even less evidence of peaks at the expected\nfrequencies. The lack of clear peaks for inertial modes\nsuggests that they are strongly affected by MRI turbulent stresses. We note that although the epicyclic mode\nhas frequency similar to inertial modes, it is immune to\nmagnetic tension forces as it is nodeless in the shearing\nbox, and hence is less susceptible to turbulent buffeting.\nOverall, we find that axisymmetrizing or box-averaging\nthe data from simulations greatly enhances the signal\nfrom oscillation modes, a technique easily adapted to\nglobal simulations. In addition, long integration times\nwill increase the signal to noise of the nearly sinusoidal\nwaves relative to the stochastic background from turbulence. It is not immediately obvious, however, why we\nclearly see peaks in our non-axisymmetric data whereas\nBrandenburg (2005) did not. Perhaps this is because his\nsimulation was stratified in the vertical direction.\n\nWe find that turbulence driven by the MRI naturally\nexcites radial epicyclic motion and axisymmetric sound\nwaves, but there is scant evidence of inertial waves. This\nmay imply that inertial modes are strongly affected by\nMRI turbulent stresses, and cease to exist as high quality oscillators. We note that the zero net magnetic flux\nsimulations presented here give rise to the weakest MRI\nturbulence possible. Inertial waves could be even more\nstrongly affected in simulations with net magnetic flux.\nInertial waves, called \"g-modes\" in the diskoseismology literature, have been proposed as the origin of some\nobserved QPOs in X-ray binaries (Wagoner 1999; Kato\n2001). However, our results imply that all but the longest\nwavelength of these hydrodynamic modes are destroyed\nby the turbulence. Even the longest wavelength modes\nare substantially altered, perhaps to the point of becoming unobservable. This presents a serious problem for\nmodels invoking g-modes to explain observed QPOs.\nWe are not clearly able to pick out non-axisymmetric,\nshearing waves in the analysis done so far. There are\nbroadened peaks in the non-axisymmetric data around\nthe frequencies of axisymmetric waves, but this is not\nclear confirmation. Furthermore, \"real\" accretion disks\nmay in fact admit standing nonaxisymmetric waves with\nconstant pattern speeds. There is substantial global simulation data which demonstrates this fact, at least for\nhydrodynamic disks (e.g. Blaes & Hawley 1988). The\nshearing box cannot capture these modes, because the\nshearing box boundary conditions preclude their existence.\nIn summary, this paper demonstrates that QPOs can\nbe found in simulations of MRI turbulence, at least in\na shearing box geometry. The well-defined boundary\nconditions of this geometry help ensure the existence of\nmodes, but it is not clear that such well-defined boundaries will exist in real accretion disks. Global MRI\nsimulations could in principle determine self-consistently\nwhether wave cavities exist and contain trapped modes.\nTraveling acoustic waves have certainly been observed in\nsuch simulations (e.g. De Villiers & Hawley 2003), but\nno evidence for modes at discrete frequencies has yet\nbeen reported. We encourage extensions of our analysis techniques to these simulations.\n\nWe thank Steve Balbus, Shane Davis, Mike Nowak and\nAristotle Socrates for useful discussions.
