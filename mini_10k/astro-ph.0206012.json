This primordial\nanisotropy has been studied extensively at degree and sub-degree angular scales in order\nto place constraints on the parameters of cosmological models (Halverson et al. 2002, de\nBernardis et al. 2002, Scott et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2001, Miller et al. 2002, Padin et al.\n2001). At arcminute scales, the primordial anisotropy is damped to negligible amplitude due\nto photon diffusion and the finite thickness of the last scattering surface (Hu & White 1997).\nOn these smaller scales, secondary anisotropies such as the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE)\nare expected to dominate the signal of the CMB power spectrum (Haiman & Knox 1999).\nStudies of secondary anisotropy in the CMB have the potential to be a powerful probe of\nthe growth of structure in the Universe.\nIn this paper, we report results from an ongoing program using the Berkeley-IllinoisMaryland Association (BIMA) interferometer to search for arcminute-scale CMB anisotropy.\nDiscussion of the instrument, data reduction, expected signals (from both primary and secondary anisotropies) and previous measurements is included in earlier publications (Holzapfel\net al. 2000 and Dawson et al. 2001, hereafter H2000 and D2001 respectively). We describe\nobservations and criteria for field selection in \u00a72. The Bayesian likelihood analysis used to\nconstrain the CMB anisotropy is described in \u00a73. The results are presented in \u00a74 including\na discussion of tests for systematic errors in the analysis. Finally, in \u00a75, we present the\nconclusion and comparison to simulations of the SZE.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nAnalysis of eleven fields observed with the BIMA array during the summers of 1997,\n1998, and 2000 revealed a significant detection of excess power (D2001). In an effort to\nachieve uniform sensitivity and selection criteria across our sample, we continued the project\nin the summer of 2001 with a subset of eight fields from the original survey. Two new fields\nwere also added to the survey for a total of ten. Each field was observed with the BIMA\narray and the Very Large Array (VLA)6 .\n6\n\nThe VLA is operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, a facility of the National Science\nFoundation, operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.1.\n\nField Selection\n\nThe two new fields added to the survey, BDF12 and BDF13, lie at Right Ascensions\nconvenient for summer observations and outside of the galactic plane. This makes for a total\nof ten independent fields for the survey in 2001, covering approximately 0.1 square degrees.\nThe fields were selected from the IRAS 100 \u03bcm and VLA NVSS (Condon et al. 1998) radio\nsurveys to lie in regions with low dust contrast and no bright radio sources. In addition, we\nused SkyView to access digitized sky survey and ROSAT images to check for bright optical\nor x-ray emission which could complicate follow-up observations. The pointing centers for\neach of the ten fields are given in Table 1.\nTwo of the fields used in the D2001 analysis, PC1643+46 and VLA1312+32, were\noriginally selected to follow-up previously reported microwave decrements (Jones et al. 1997;\nRichards et al. 1997). A third field, in the direction of the high redshift quasar PSS0030+17,\nwas originally selected as a distant cluster candidate. These three fields did not follow the\nsame selection criteria as the rest of the fields and are not included in the present sample.\nSince observations of these fields are not as deep as those for the other blank fields, removing\nthem from the survey does not have a significant effect on the results reported in this paper.\n\n2.2.\n\nBIMA Observations\n\nA priority for 2001 observations was to achieve uniform flux sensitivity across the sample\nof ten fields. We re-observed fields from the previous years and dedicated 55 hours to each of\nthe new fields, aiming for a uniform noise level of < 150 \u03bcJy/beam RMS on short baselines\n(u-v < 1.1 k\u03bb) for each field in the sample. This noise level corresponds to \u223c 15 \u03bcK RMS\nfor a 2\u2032 synthesized beam. An image of the field BDF13 observed with the BIMA array is\nincluded in Figure 1 to illustrate the sensitivity in the u-v range 0.63 \u2212 1.1 k\u03bb.\nAll anisotropy observations were made using the BIMA array at Hat Creek. Nine 6.1\nmeter telescopes of the array were equipped for operation at 28.5 GHz, providing a 6.6\u2032\nFWHM field of view. In order to track phase and gain fluctuations, all field observations\nwere bracketed by observations of bright radio point sources (H2000). The fluxes of these\ncalibration sources are all referenced to the flux of Mars which is uncertain by approximately\n4% at 90% confidence (see discussion in Grego 2001). This uncertainty is small compared\nto the uncertainty in the anisotropy signals we report here and therefore makes a negligible\ncontribution to the uncertainties in the reported results. The cumulative integration time\nfor each of the ten fields observed in this survey is listed in Table 1. Figure 2 shows the\nresult of imaging the field BDF13 using all of the u-v data from the summer of 2001. This\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nimage is a fair representation of the fields in the survey which typically have only u-v data in\nthe range 0.63 \u2212 3.0 k\u03bb. After calibration and data edits, a total of 607 hours of integration\nhave been dedicated to this project.\n\n2.3.\n\nVLA Observations and Point Source Results\n\nSources of foreground emission have the potential to contaminate estimates of the CMB\npower spectrum. Contaminants at 28.5 GHz arising from galactic sources such as dust,\nsynchrotron, and free-free emission are expected to be below the \u03bcK level at arcminute\nangular scales in the regions of the sky selected for this survey. However, emission from radio\npoint sources could contribute significantly to excess power in the observations described here\n(e.g. Tegmark et al. 2000).\nThe compact configuration used for the BIMA anisotropy observations was designed\nto produce high sensitivity to extended sources. However, this configuration has limited\nsensitivity on the long baselines which in principle could be used to locate and remove\npoint sources. To help constrain the contribution from point sources to the anisotropy\nmeasurements, we used the VLA at a frequency of 4.8 GHz to observe each field in the\nsurvey. With 1.5 hours per field, these observations yielded an RMS flux of \u223c 25 \u03bcJy/beam\nfor a 9\u2032 FWHM region with the same pointing center as a BIMA field. The positions of all\npoint sources with flux > 6\u03c3 within 8\u2032 of the pointing center have been recorded. Measured\npoint sources with fluxes corrected for attenuation from the primary beam at 4.8 GHz are\nlisted in Table 2. An image of the field BDF13 is shown in Figure 3 as an example of\nobservations used to identify point sources from the VLA data.\nIf the spectra of the point sources are relatively flat or falling, deep observations with\nthe VLA will identify those that lie near the noise level in the 28.5 GHz maps. However, it\nis possible that a radio source with a steeply inverted spectrum may lie below the VLA detection threshold but still contribute to the observations at 28.5 GHz. Advection dominated\naccretion flows are thought to be the most common inverted spectrum sources. They typically have a slowly rising spectrum, with a spectral index of 0.3 to 0.4 (Perna and DiMatteo,\n2000). Such a shallow spectrum would only provide a factor of two increase in flux between\n4.8 GHz and 28.5 GHz.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe analysis in this paper is similar to that used to produce the previous BIMA\nanisotropy results and is based on the formalism presented in White et al. (1999) for the\ndetermination of the CMB power spectrum from interferometer data. We bin the visibility\ndata and calculate joint confidence intervals as described in H2000. The likelihood function\nto test a theory for a set of bandpowers, {Cl }, with n measured visibilities is defined\nL ({Cl }) =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n\u2217\n\u22121\nexp\n\u2212V\n(u\n)C\nV\n(u\n)\ni\nj\nij\n\u03c0 n det C\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Cij is the correlation matrix of visibilities at ui and uj .\n\nThere are several changes from the analysis in H2000. We first perform the analysis on\na single bandpower with data spanning the u-v range 0.63 \u2212 1.7 k\u03bb. We then perform an\nanalysis with data divided into two bins, 0.63 \u2212 1.1 k\u03bb and 1.1 \u2212 1.7 k\u03bb, corresponding to\ndifferent spatial resolution. A constraint correlation matrix is introduced to account for the\npoint sources identified with the VLA. In this new formalism, the correlation matrix can be\nrepresented as\nCij = CijV + CijN + CijC ,\n(2)\nwhere CijV represents the theory correlation matrix, CijN represents the noise correlation\nmatrix, and CijC represents the constraint correlation matrix used to remove the effect of\npoint sources from the determination of the CMB power spectrum.\n\n3.1.\n\nTheory Correlation Matrix\n\nThe fundamental tool for analysis of Gaussian temperature fluctuations is the theory\ncorrelation matrix. The theory correlation matrix is calculated from the observed visibilities\nmeasured at a set of points ui . The measured flux densities are given by\nZ\n\u2202B\u03bd\nV (u) =\ndx \u2206T (x) A(x)e2\u03c0iu*x ,\n(3)\n\u2202T\nwhere \u2206T (x) is the temperature distribution on the sky, A(x) is the primary beam of the\ntelescope,\n\u00132\n\u0012\nx4 ex\nkB T\n\u2202B\u03bd\n= 2kB\n,\n(4)\n\u2202T\nhc\n(ex \u2212 1)2\nkB is Boltzmann's constant, and x \u2261 h\u03bd/kB Tcmb . Following White et al.

For the analysis in\nthis work, it is assumed that \u2206T 2 \u2265 0 and for visibility data in the u-v range 1.7 \u2212 3.0 k\u03bb,\nCijV = 0.\n\n3.2.\n\nNoise Correlation Matrix\n\nAs with most interferometric observations, the system temperature of the receivers in the\nBIMA array is continuously monitored. Each visibility is assigned an estimated uncertainty\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1\n2kB Tsys,i\n2\n,\n(10)\n\u03c3raw,i =\n\u03b7A\n\u2206\u03bd t\nwhere Tsys,i is the system temperature for the visibility V (ui ), \u03b7 is the aperture efficiency, A\nis the area of the telescope, \u2206\u03bd is the effective bandwidth, and t is the integration time. The\nvalues of Tsys,i , \u03b7, and \u2206\u03bd are known within a few percent. The noise is rescaled independently\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nfor each baseline. The reduced \u03c72 is calculated from each visibility, j, recorded from a given\nbaseline\nX V \u2217 (uj )V (uj )\n.\n(11)\n\u03c72 =\n2\n\u03c3raw,j\nj\n\u03c32\n\nThe noise for that baseline is then rescaled so that \u03c3j2 = raw,j\n. The noise correlation\n\u03c72\nmatrix is calculated from the rescaled noise for each baseline as in H2000, CiiN = \u03c312 . With\ni\napproximately 3000 visibilities per baseline, the expected error in the rescaled noise due to\nsample variance is \u223c 1.8% on a single baseline. In order to test what effect this uncertainty\nhas on the analysis, we both increased and decreased each term in the noise correlation\nmatrix by 2% and found no significant change in estimates of excess power.\n\n3.3.\n\nConstraint Correlation Matrix\n\nAs discussed in D2001, the effectiveness of subtracting point sources directly from the\nvisibility data is limited with the compact configuration of the BIMA array. Using the\nVLA at 4.8 GHz, we can identify the positions of point sources which might contaminate\nthe visibility data. We introduce a constraint correlation matrix (Bond et al. 1998) to\nmarginalize over point source fluxes as in Halverson et al. (2002). Using this formalism, it\nis necessary only to identify the position of a potential source and not its flux.\nEach point source is represented with a template \u039bni of unknown amplitude \u03ban for each\nvisibility V (ui ) where the subscript, n, corresponds to the nth point source. The template is\nderived from the response of the visibilities to a point source that is offset from the pointing\ncenter by \u2206RAn , \u2206DECn for a baseline, (ui , vi )\n\u039bni = e2\u03c0i(ui \u2206RAn +vi \u2206DECn )\nThe constraint correlation matrix can be expressed\nX\n\u039bni \u03ban \u039bn\u2032 j \u03ban\u2032\nCijC =\n\n.\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nn,n\u2032\n\nwhere n and n\u2032 are each summed over the number of point sources in the field. In the limit\n\u03ban \u03ban\u2032 \u2192 \u221e, this procedure effectively assigns zero weight to modes within the visibility data\nthat correspond to point source positions identified with the VLA. To avoid singularities in\nthe inverted correlation matrix, a finite, but large (\u03ban \u03ban\u2032 \u226b hCiiN i) value is assigned to the\npoint source amplitude. A value of \u03ban \u03ban\u2032 \u223c 104 hCiiN i has been assumed in the analysis; the\nresults are insensitive to the exact value of \u03ban \u03ban\u2032 .\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nAlthough some fields were observed in 1998 with longer baselines, most fields in this\nsurvey were observed from the compact configuration. The compact configuration of the\nBIMA array was contained within a u-v radius of 3.0 k\u03bb. These baselines are included in\norder to achieve a reasonable level of discrimination between the signature of a point source\nand the CMB anisotropy described in \u00a73.1. In this manner, we remove the contribution to\nthe measured power from linear combinations of baselines that may be corrupted by point\nsource emission. With each additional point source constraint, a degree of freedom is lost\nand the uncertainty in the measured power increases accordingly.\n\n4.\n\nResults\n\nWe have produced and analyzed images for each of the observed fields. The statistics\nof the images are described in Table 3 (0.63 \u2212 1.7 k\u03bb), 4 (0.63 \u2212 1.1 k\u03bb), and 5 (1.1 \u2212 1.7 k\u03bb).\nThe reported RMS values are those expected from the noise properties of the visibilities.\nThe RMS temperature measurement corresponds to the synthesized beamsize for the given\nuv coverage. The baselines used to produce the image statistics are the same as the baselines\nincluded in the two bins of visibility data for the CMB anisotropy analysis. The window\nfunction produced from the noise weighted sum of the window functions for the individual\nvisibilities in the u-v range 0.63 \u2212 1.1 k\u03bb has an average value of lef f = 5237 with FWHM\nl = 2870. The window function for visibilities in the u-v range 1.1 \u2212 1.7 k\u03bb has an average\nvalue lef f = 8748 with FWHM l = 4150. For the analysis using a single bin of data in the\nu-v range 0.63 \u2212 1.7 k\u03bb, lef f = 6864 with FWHM l = 6800. The window functions for all\nthree bands are plotted as a function of multipole in Figure 4.\n\n4.1.\n\nMeasurement of Anisotropy\n\nWe present the results of the analysis of the BIMA data assuming a CMB power spectrum that is described by one or two flat band powers. In Tables 3, 4, and 5, we show the\nmost likely \u2206T with confidence intervals for each of the ten fields included in this survey.\nResults for the joint likelihood for all the data are also included. Figure 5 shows the relative likelihoods as a function of assumed \u2206T for a combined likelihood analysis of the ten\nfields. The results are normalized to unity likelihood for the case of no anisotropy signal.\nThe measured signal exceeds that expected from instrument noise with 97.8% confidence for\ndata which falls in the u-v range 0.63 \u2212 1.1 k\u03bb and with 96.5% confidence for the single bin\nof visibility data that covers the u-v range 0.63 \u2212 1.7 k\u03bb.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nWe include a contour plot of the two dimensional likelihood function in Figure 6 in order\nto demonstrate the correlation between the two flat band power bins. Contours represent\n68%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals. We calculate the correlation between the two\nbandpower bins directly from the likelihood function,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh(\u2206T1 \u2212 \u2206T 1 )(\u2206T2 \u2212 \u2206T 2 )i\nh(\u2206T1 \u2212 \u2206T 1 )2 i\nF =\n(14)\nh(\u2206T2 \u2212 \u2206T 2 )(\u2206T1 \u2212 \u2206T 1 )i\nh(\u2206T2 \u2212 \u2206T 2 )2 i\n\nF =\n\n\u0012\n\n3.738 \u00d7 10\u221211 1.448 \u00d7 10\u221211\n1.448 \u00d7 10\u221211 1.920 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\n\u0013\n\n(\u03bcK)2\n\nThis matrix can be diagonalized with eigenvalues\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3.604 \u00d7 10\u221211\n0\n\u2032\nF =\n(\u03bcK)2\n0\n1.933 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nand corresponding eigenvectors, X\u20321 = 0.996X1 + 0.0893X2 and X\u20322 = 0.0893X1 \u2212 0.996X2.\nThere is less than 10% correlation between the two bins of visibility data.\n\n4.2.\n\nSystematics Check\n\nWe performed tests for systematic errors in all fields with significant excess power as\ndescribed in D2001. Due to finite computing resources, the analysis is limited to visibility\ndata in u-v range 0.63 \u2212 1.1 k\u03bb described by \u2206T1 . The power in the second bin is fixed at\n\u2206T2 = 0 for all tests described in this section. We tested for sources of contamination that\nchange with time. Assuming that a terrestrial source, the sun, or the moon varies in position\nby several degrees over the course of a few days, such a local effect should be discovered from\nanalysis of subsets divided into hours of observation or days of observation described in\nD2001. For the field BDF12, an analysis of three subsets divided into time of observation\nand three subsets of date of observation revealed a range of values \u2206T1 = 16.2+21.4\n\u221216.2 \u03bcK to\n+33.5\n\u2206T1 = 71.0\u221228.0 \u03bcK, in each case consistent with the reported value of \u2206T1 = 44.2+16.4\n\u221213.7 \u03bcK.\nFor the field BDF13, the various subsets were found to have most likely values in the range\n\u2206T1 = 33.8 \u03bcK to \u2206T1 = 58.9 \u03bcK, consistent with the reported value of \u2206T1 = 38.8+17.2\n\u221215.9 \u03bcK.\nThere was no significant difference in the measured power in subsets divided by day of\nobservation or in the subsets divided by hour of observation.\nWe also added three additional tests this year to search for systematic errors in BDF12\nand BDF13. We performed a jack-knife systematic test by breaking the data into subsets of\nfour and five telescopes looking for antenna based systematic errors. For a test of baseline\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nbased systematic errors, we created an east-west baseline subset and a north-south baseline\nsubset. Subsets for BDF12 had most likely values in the range \u2206T1 = 30.7 \u03bcK to \u2206T1 =\n53.0 \u03bcK while subsets for BDF13 had most likely values in the range \u2206T1 = 37.2 \u03bcK to\n\u2206T1 = 41.9 \u03bcK. There was approximately the same level of excess power in each subset, as\nwell as all of the subsets described in D2001. The third test combined the raw visibilities\nfrom observations of several different fields taken in a single summer to look for correlations\nbetween observations of independent fields. As would be expected for uncorrelated data, the\nanalysis of the combined data sets revealed a measurement of excess power that is consistent\nwith instrumental noise to 68% confidence. Overall, we find no evidence that our results are\nbiased by systematic effects.\nAs discussed in \u00a72.3, we have adopted a VLA flux density limit of 6\u03c3 for identifying\npoint sources. We now consider how different point source flux density limits affect our\nestimates of CMB anisotropy. We test the effect of four different point source models on\nthe determination of the most likely \u2206T1 and confidence intervals. The results are found in\nTable 6. There is no significant difference in the \u2206T1 determined from the range of models\nconsidered. As in D2001, the flat band power results are insensitive to the details of the\npoint source analysis.\n\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the course of three summers, we have used the BIMA array in a compact configuration at 28.5 GHz to search for CMB anisotropy in ten independent 6.6\u2032 FWHM fields. With\nthese observations, we have detected arcminute scale anisotropy at better than 95% confidence. In the context of an assumed flat band power model for the CMB power spectrum,\nwe find \u2206T = 14.2+4.8\n\u22126.0 \u03bcK at 68.3% confidence with sensitivity on scales that correspond\nto an average harmonic multipole lef f = 6864. We also present results after dividing the\nvisibility data into two bins of different spatial resolution. We find \u2206T1 = 16.6+5.3\n\u22125.9 \u03bcK at\n68.3% confidence on scales corresponding to an average harmonic multipole lef f = 5237 and\n\u2206T2 < 26.5 \u03bcK at 95% confidence at lef f = 8748. The results of the VLA observations\nappear to exclude the possibility of point source contamination and there is no indication of\nan obvious systematic error that would bias the observations.\nMason et al. (2002) have also reported a detection of excess power at somewhat larger\nangular scales. They find \u2206T = 22.5+2.5\n\u22123.6 \u03bcK for data in the range 2010 < l < 4000.\nAlthough this measurement is at a lower l than the BIMA results, it is significantly higher\nthan the expected power due to primordial anisotropy.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nIf the signal observed in the BIMA fields is indeed caused by CMB anisotropy, there\nare a host of possible sources for excess power such as primary anisotropy, thermal SZE,\nkinetic SZE, patchy reionization, and the Ostriker-Vishniac effect. Of these candidates for\nCMB anisotropy, the thermal SZE from clusters of galaxies is expected to dominate on the\nscales where the BIMA instrument is most sensitive (see for example, Gnedin & Jaffe 2001).\nAnalytic models and simulations of cluster formation predict \u2206T values that range from\n4.3 \u03bcK to 15.0 \u03bcK on angular scales of approximately two arcminutes. Figure 7 compares\nthe results of this paper to the theoretical models.\nThe non-Gaussian characteristics of the CMB power spectrum caused by the thermal\nSZE may increase the uncertainty in measurements of the power spectrum due to sample\nvariance. Current models suggest that these effects increase the uncertainty by a factor of\n3 over what is expected for the sample variance of a Gaussian distributed signal at l \u223c\n5000 (White, Hernquist, & Springel 2002). Based on this argument,\nthe effect of nonp\nGaussian sample variance contributes a standard deviation of 3 \u00d7 2/N \u2206T = 6.0 \u03bcK to the\nanisotropy measurements,\np where N \u223c 100 is the number of independent pixels in the u-v\nrange 0.63 \u2212 1.1 k\u03bb and 2/N \u2206T is the sample variance in a Gaussian distributed signal.\nThe uncertainty due to sample variance is approximately equal to the statistical uncertainty\nreported in this paper, increasing the overall uncertainty by 40%, in agreement with the\npredictions of Zhang, Pen & Wang (2002). The predicted effect of sample variance on the\nmeasurements is represented by the extended error bars in Figure 7.\n\nWe thank the entire staff of the BIMA observatory for their many contributions to\nthis project, in particular Rick Forster and Dick Plambeck for their assistance with both\nthe instrumentation and observations.
