The first one is to write a theory which is shown to have a nontrivial limit, or zero for\nthe beta function of the renormalization group for a non zero value of the coupling constant, as the renormalization\ncut-off goes to infinity. The perturbatively nontrivial \u03c64 theory in four dimensions was shown to go to a free theory\nas the cut-off was lifted a while ago [1, 2, 3]. This example shows that perturbative expansions are not decisive in\nobtaining a nontrivial model. There is continuing research on this subject [4].\nThe other ongoing endeavor is to use only fermions to build a model of nature, where all the observed bosons are\nconstructed as composites of these entities. In solid state physics the basic fields, the electrons come together to form\nbosons to explain superconductivity [5]. Heisenberg spent years to formulate a \"theory of everything\" for particle\nphysics, using only fermions [6]. The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model [7], which was constructed based on an analogy\nwith the BCS theory of superconductivity [5], is a model which satisfies both ambitions, which is written in terms of\nfermions only and perturbatively non-renormalizable. This model also was shown to go to a trivial model [8, 9].\nThere are new attempts to make sense of these theories either as an effective model at low energies, which will give\nvaluable information in QCD [10, 11], for example for the studies of hadron mass generation through spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking. Another attempt is gauging the model and investigating whether the new coupling gives rise to\na nontrivial theory [12, 13, 14, 15]. These examples show that the search for non-trivial models using only fermions\nmay be an interesting endeavor.\nAnother attempt in writing a model using only fermions came with the work of G\u00fcrsey, [16]. Here a non-polynomial\nbut conformal invariant Lagrangian was written to describe self-interacting fermions with the intention of remedying\nsome of the problems of the Heisenberg model [6]. To be able to write a conformally invariant lagrangian, G\u00fcrsey\nhad to use a non-polynomial form. Kortel found solutions to this conformal invariant theory [17] which were shown\nto be instantons and merons much later [18].\nOne of us, with collaborators, tried to make quantum sense of this model a while ago [19, 20, 21], finding that even\nif these attempts were justified, this model went to a trivial model as the cut-off is removed. Several processes were\ncalculated [22] involving incoming and outgoing spinors which gave exactly the naive quark model results, missing\nthe observed logarithmic behavior predicted by QCD calculations.\nWe tried to give a new interpretation of our old work in [23]. In that work we saw that the polynomial form of the\noriginal model really did not correspond to the original G\u00fcrsey model in the exact sense. The two versions obey\ndifferent symmetries. This was shown explicitly in reference [23]. We went to higher orders in the calculation, beyond\none loop for scattering processes. By using the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations we could calculate\nhigher order processes. We saw that while the non-trivial scattering of the fundamental fields was not allowed, bound\nstates could scatter from each other with non-trivial amplitudes.\nThe essential point in our analysis was the fact that, being proportional to p\u01eb2 , the composite scalar field propagator\ncancelled many of the potential infinities that arise while calculating loop integrals. As a result of this cancellation,\nonly composite fields participate in physical processes such as scattering and particle production. The scattering\nand production of elementary spinor fields were not allowed. This phenomena was an example of treating the bound\nstates, instead of the principal fields, as physical entities.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: hortacsu@itu.edu.tr\naddress: bcan@itu.edu.tr\n\u2021 Electronic address: taskinf@itu.edu.tr\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\fGauged System Mimicking the G\u00fcrsey Model\n\n2\n\nA further point will be to couple an elementary vector field to the model described in reference [23], in line with the\nprocess studied for the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model [12, 13]. Coupling the same elementary field to the model described\nin reference [24] will be similar, giving a model with two vector fields, one composite, the other one elementary. Our\nfinal goal is to investigate if we get a non-trivial theory when we couple a Yang-Mills system with color and flavor\ndegrees of freedom, like it is done in [14, 15]. Here we study the abelian case, as an initial step.\nIn this note we summarize the changes in our results when this elementary vector field is coupled to the model\ndescribed in reference [23]. We outline the model as is given in Refs. [19] and [23] in next section and give our new\nresults in subsequent sections. The main conclusion is that our original model, in which only the composites take\npart in physical processes like scattering or particle production, is reduced to a gauged\u2013Higgs-Yukawa model, where\nboth the composites and the fundamental spinor and vector fields participate in all the processes.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nOur initial model is given by the Lagrangian\nL = i\u03c8\u2202/\u03c8 + g\u03c8\u03c8\u03c6 + \u03be(g\u03c8\u03c8 \u2212 a\u03c63 ).\n\n(1)\n\nHere the only terms with kinetic part are the spinors. \u03be is a Lagrange multiplier field, \u03c6 is a scalar field with no kinetic\npart, g and a are coupling constants. This expression contains two constraint equations, obtained from writing the\nEuler-Lagrange equations for the \u03be and \u03c6 fields. Hence, it should be quantized using the Dirac constraint analysis as\nperformed in reference [23].\nThe Lagrangian given above is just an attempt in writing the original G\u00fcrsey Lagrangian\nL = i\u03c8\u2202/\u03c8 + g \u2032 (\u03c8\u03c8)4/3 ,\n\n(2)\n\nin a polynomial form.\nWe see that the \u03b3 5 invariance of the original G\u00fcrsey Lagrangian is retained in the form written in equation (1). This\ndiscrete symmetry prevents \u03c8 from acquiring a finite mass in higher orders. We also see that the two models given\nby lagrangians in equations (1) and (2) are not equivalent since the former does not obey one extra symmetry obeyed\nby the latter one. This was carefully studied in reference [23]. We, therefore, take the first model as a model which\nonly approximates the original G\u00fcrsey model, without claiming equivalence and study only that model in this work.\nTo quantize the latter system consistently we proceed via the path integral method. This procedure was carried out\nin reference [23]. At the end of these calculations we found out that we can write the constrained lagrangian given in\nequation (1) as\nL\u2032\u2032 = i\u03c8[\u2202/ \u2212 ig\u03a6]\u03c8 \u2212\n\ni\na 4\n(\u03a6 + 2\u03a63 \u039e \u2212 2\u03a6\u039e3 \u2212 \u039e4 ) + c\u2217 (\u03a62 + 2\u03a6\u039e + \u039e2 )c,\n16\n4\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the effective lagrangian is expressed in terms of scalar fields \u03a6, and \u039e, ghost fields c, c\u2217 and spinor fields only.\nThe fermion propagator is the usual Dirac propagator in lowest order, as can be seen from the Lagrangian. After\nintegrating over the fermion fields in the path integral, we obtain the effective action. The second derivative of the\neffective action with respect to the \u03a6 field gives us the induced inverse propagator for the \u03a6 field, with the infinite\npart given as\n\nInf\n\n\u0014\n\nig 2\nTr\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\nd4 p\ng2 q2\n.\n=\n/(p\np\n/ + /q )\n8\u03c0 2 \u01eb\n\n(4)\n\nHere dimensional regularization is used for the momentum integral and \u01eb = 4 \u2212 n. We see that the \u03a6 field propagates\nas a massless field.\nWhen we study the propagators for the other fields, we see that no linear or quadratic term in \u039e exists, so the one\nloop contribution to the \u039e propagator is absent. Similarly the mixed derivatives of the effective action with respect\nto \u039e and \u03a6 are zero at one loop, so no mixing between these two fields occurs. We can also set the propagators of\nthe ghost fields to zero, since they give no contribution in the one loop approximation. The higher loop contributions\nare absent for these fields.\n\n\fGauged System Mimicking the G\u00fcrsey Model\n\n3\n\nIn reference [23] we also studied the contributions to the fermion propagator at higher orders and we found, by\nstudying the Dyson-Schwinger equations for the two point function, that there were no new contributions. We had\nat least one phase where the mass of the spinor field was zero.\nIn reference [24] we studied a similar model where the composite vector field replaced the composite scalar field, with\nsimilar results.\nIII.\n\nNEW RESULTS AND HIGHER ORDERS\n\nHere we couple an elementary vector field to the model described in reference [23], in a minimal way, with a new\ncoupling constant e, acting in accordance of the work in references [12, 13, 14, 25, 26]. The new lagrangian is given as\na\nL\u2032 = i\u03c8[\u2202/ \u2212 ig\u03a6]\u03c8 \u2212 (\u03a64 + 2\u03a63 \u039e \u2212 2\u039e3 \u03a6 \u2212 \u039e4 )\n4\ni \u2217 2\n1\n/\u03c8.\n+ c (\u039e + 2\u03a6\u039e + \u03a62 )c \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03c8eA\n4\n4\n\n(5)\n\nHere A\u03bc is the elementary vector field and F \u03bc\u03bd is defined from A\u03bc in the usual way. We take the vector field propagator\nin the Feynman gauge in our explicit calculations. This lagrangian reduces to the effective expression given below,\nsince the \u039e and the ghost fields decouple.\na\n1\nL\u2032 = i\u03c8[\u2202/ \u2212 ig\u03a6]\u03c8 \u2212 \u03a64 \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03c8eA\n/\u03c8.\n4\n4\n\n(6)\n\nIn this section we summarize the changes in our results for this new model.\nIf our fermion field had a color index i where i = 1...N , we could perform an 1/N expansion to justify the use of only\nladder diagrams for higher orders for the scattering processes. Although in our model the spinor has only one color,\nwe still consider only ladder diagrams anticipating that one can construct a variation of the model with N colors.\nA.\n\nRenormalization Group Analysis\n\nIn the models given in references [23] and [24], we had two coupling constants, g and a in reference [23] and only\none, which we rename as g \u2032 , in reference [24]. In the model described in reference [24], there is no need for infinite\ncoupling constant renormalization, since the spinor box diagram is finite when the incoming and outgoing particles\nare vectors [27, 28]. In the model described in reference [23], the coupling constant a needs renormalization. In these\nmodels there is no need for infinite renormalization for g and respectively for g \u2032 since the diagrams for the < \u03c8\u03c8\u03c6 >\nand < \u03c8\u03c8A\u03bc > vertices are finite.\nUsing the language of renormalization group analysis, the first order for this vertex is given by\n\n\u03bc\n\ndg0\n= 0,\nd\u03bc\n\n(7)\n\nsince the diagram given in Figure 1.a is finite, due to the presence of \u01eb in the scalar propagator. Higher order\ncalculations using the Bethe-Salpeter equation verify that the right hand side of the equation does not change in\nhigher orders. This process was studied in reference [23].\nWe see that in the original model the only infinite renormalization is needed for the four \u03c6 vertex; hence the coupling\nconstant for this process runs. The first correction to the tree diagram is the box diagram, shown in Figure 1.b .\nThis diagram has four spinor propagators and gives rise to a 1\u01eb type divergence. The renormalization group equation\nwritten for this vertex is\n16\u03c0 2 \u03bc\n\nda\n= \u2212dg04 ,\nd\u03bc\n\n(8)\n\nHere the right hand side of the equation is equal to a constant, since g0 does not run. Since we include the four \u03c6\nterm in our original lagrangian, we can renormalize the coupling constant of this vertex to incorporate this divergence.\nThere are no higher infinities for this vertex. The two loop diagram contains, as shown in Figure 1.c, a \u03c6 propagator\n\n\fGauged System Mimicking the G\u00fcrsey Model\n\n4\n\nwhich makes this diagram finite. The three-loop diagram is made out of eight spinor and two scalar lines, Figure\n1.d. At worst we end up with a first order infinity of the form 1\u01eb using the dimensional regularization scheme. Higher\norder ladder diagrams give at worst the same type of divergence. This divergence for the four scalar vertex can be\nrenormalized using standart means.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 1: The diagrams related to the initial model .

Here all three coupling constants\nare renormalized.\nWe can write the three first order renormalization group equations for these three coupling constants similar to the\nanalysis in [29].\nde\n= be3 ,\nd\u03bc\ndg\n16\u03c0 2 \u03bc\n= \u2212cge2 ,\nd\u03bc\nda\n= \u2212dg 4 ,\n16\u03c0 2 \u03bc\nd\u03bc\n16\u03c0 2 \u03bc\n\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere b, c, d are numerical constants.

Here vector particles are represented by the wiggly lines additional\nto the former ones shown in Fig. 1.\n\nOur equations differ from those in reference [29], since the interaction of the composite scalar field with the spinors\ndoes not result in infinite terms due to the presence of the factor \u01eb in the scalar propagator. Here \u01eb, the parameter\nin the dimensional regularization scheme, is inversely proportional to ln \u039b\u039b0 where \u039b is the cut-off parameter.

The third equation diverges because of the contribution of the box diagram, which is infinite even\nin the absence of the vector field. For this coupling constant, at one loop level, there is no difference from its behavior\nin the original model.\nIn the original model we need an infinite renormalization for only one of the coupling constants, the one with the four\nscalar field. Further renormalization may be necessary at each higher loop, like any other renormalizable model. The\ndifference between our original model and other renormalizable models lies in the fact that, although this model is a\nrenormalizable one using naive dimensional counting arguments, we have only one set of diagrams which is divergent.\nWe need to renormalize only one of the coupling constants by an infinite amount. This set of diagrams, corresponding\nto the scattering of two bound states to two bound states, has the same type of divergence, i.e. 1\u01eb in the dimensional\nregularization scheme for all odd number of loops. The contributions from even number of diagrams are finite, hence\nrequire no infinite renormalization.\nWhen additional the vector particle contributions are added, this expression is modified. The process where two\nscalar particles goes to two scalar particles gets further infinite contributions from the box type diagrams with vector\nfield insertions, where one part of the diagram is connected to the non-adjacent part with a vector field as shown in\nthe Figure 3.a. All these diagrams go as 1\u01eb where \u01eb is the parameter in dimensional regularization scheme. There are\nno higher divergences for this process. Note that mixed scalar and vector insertions do not give additional infinities,\nsince the scalar propagator reduces the degree of divergence. Also note that the diagram where the internal photon\nis connecting adjacent sides, as shown Figure 3.b, will be a contribution to the coupling constant renormalization of\none of the vertices. Since this is not a new contribution, we will not consider it separately.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 3: (a) The vector particle correction to the fermion box diagram, (b) the box diagram with one vertex correction.\n\nB.\n\nPropagators and Vertices\n\nWe have no essential change in the spinor propagator. In reference [11] Miransky explains how for coupling constant \u03b1\ne2\nless than \u03c0/3, there is no mass generation in the quenched approximation. Here \u03b1 = 4\u03c0\n. J.C.R. Bloch, in his Durham\nthesis, [30], explores the range where this result is valid when the calculation is done without this approximation. He\nstates that the quenched and the rainbow approximations, used by Miransky and collaborators, have non physical\nfeatures, namely they are not gauge invariant, making the calculated value wildly vary depending on the particular\ngauge used. Bloch, himself, uses the Ball-Chiu vertex, [31], instead of the bare one, where the exact longitudinal\npart of the full QED vertex, is uniquely determined by the Ward-Takahashi identity relating the vertex with the\npropagator. The transverse part of the vertex, however, is still arbitrary. Bloch then considers a special form of the\nCurtis-Pennington vertex [32] in which the transverse part of the vertex is constructed by requiring the multiplicative\nrenormalizability of the fermion propagator with additional assumptions.\nBloch claims that for the different gauges used with this choice, he gets rather close values for the critical coupling\n[33]. He also performs numerical calculations where the approximations are kept to a minimum. The results are given\nin the table on pg. 202 of hep-ph/0208074.\nUsing on the arguments in the Bloch's thesis, also using the results of his numerical calculations, we conclude that at\nleast for \u03b1 < 0.5 we can safely claim that there will be no mass generation or the assumed \u03b35 symmetry will be not\nbroken. Since we do not study heavy ion processes, the numerical value we have for \u03b1 will be much smaller than this\nlimit. Hence, our results will be valid. Note that in QCD mass generation occurs at relatively low energies, where the\ncoupling constant has already increased.\nMiransky [11] also explains how in the Landau gauge we can take the coefficient of the momentum term as unity.\nUsing these arguments we can conclude that there are no additional contributions to the spinor propagator used in\nreference [23], at least in the Landau gauge.\n\n\fGauged System Mimicking the G\u00fcrsey Model\n\n6\n\nThe photon propagator also will be the similar as the one given in QED, with only additional 1\u01eb contributions from the\nscalar particle insertions. The lowest order diagram for this process is shown in Figure 4.a. The dominant contribution\nwill be from the vector insertions, which are studied in QED.\n\nFIG. 4: (a) Scalar contribution to the vector propagator, (b)The vector particle correction to the scalar propagator\n\nThe additional contribution to the scalar propagator can be calculated using diagrammatical analysis. If we take only\nthe planar diagrams which connect two different spinor lines, as shown in Figure 4.b, the scalar field contributions\nare only of order 1\u01eb , the same as the one loop initial contribution. Higher order divergences come from the vector field\ninsertions.\nThe higher order planar insertions will be the dominant ones if we allow Nf flavors for the fermions, where Nf is\nlarge, and perform an N1f expansion. We will assume that the same approximation can be done in our case too. The\n2\n\n\u22124e\nn\ndiagrams where there are n \u2212 1 nonadjacent and planar vector field contributions, go as ( \u2212D\n\u01eb ) , where D = (4\u03c0)2 is a\nnumerical constant. Naively the planar vector field contributions can be summed up as a geometric series [34]. The\nsame result is true also for the planar vertex corrections as in Figure 5.a.\nThe vector- spinor- antispinor vertex do not get infinite contributions from our composite scalar particle. A typical\ndiagram is given in Figure 5.b. Here the infinities coming from the integrations are cancelled by the \u01eb factors in the\nscalar propagators. That vertex, for the purely electromagnetic case, Figure 5.c, is vastly studied in the literature\n[31, 32].\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 5: (a) The vector particle correction in higher orders, (b) The scalar particle insertions to the vector- spinor- antispinor\nvertex, (c) The vector- spinor-antispinor vertex\n\nC.\n\nScattering and Production Processes\n\nThe process where two composite scalars scattering from each other was studied above. The scattering of two scalars\nproducing four, or to any higher even number of scalars is finite, as expected to have a renormalizable model. The\nprocess where two scalars create an odd number of scalars is forbidden by the \u03b3 5 invariance of the theory, hence two\nscalar \u03c6 particles can only go to an even number of scalar particles. This assertion is easily checked by diagrammatic\nanalysis.\nWe also note that in the original model the four spinor kernel was of order \u01eb. The lowest order diagram, shown in\nFigure 6.a, vanishes as \u01eb due to the presence of the scalar propagator. In higher orders this expression can be written\nin the quenched ladder approximation [11], where the kernel is seperated into a scalar propagator with two spinor legs\njoining the proper kernel. If the proper kernel is of order \u01eb, the loop involving two spinors and a scalar propagator\ncan be at most finite that makes the whole diagram in first order in \u01eb. This fact also shows that there is no nontrivial\nspinor-spinor scattering.\nAs a result of this analysis, in the ungauged version, we end up with a model where there is no scattering of the\nfundamental fields, i.e. the spinors, whereas the composite scalar fields can take part in a scattering process. The\ncoupling constant for the scattering of the composite particles runs, whereas the coupling constant for the spinor-scalar\ninteraction does not run. The processes giving this conclusion are carefully studied in reference [23].\nThis result changes drastically when the gauged model is studied instead of the original one. This process, which is\nprohibited in the previous model, [23], now is possible due to the presence of the vector field channel. In lowest order\nthis process goes through the tree diagram given in Figure 6.b.\n\n\fGauged System Mimicking the G\u00fcrsey Model\n\n7\n\nThe process is finite though, since at the next higher order the QED box diagram with two spinors and two vector\nparticles, Figure 6.c, is ultra violet finite from dimensional analysis, and is calculated in reference [35]. Higher orders\ndo not give new type of ultra violet divergences.\nWe also allow spinor production from the scattering of scalar particles, since now we can use vector particles as\nintermediaries, Figure 6.d.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 6: (a) Two fermion scattering through the scalar particle channel, (b) Two fermion scattering through the vector particle\nchannel, (c) Higher order diagram for two spinor scattering, (d) Spinor production from scattering of scalars\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this note we discussed the differences between the new model, introduced in this paper, and the model studied\nin reference [23]. We found out that many of the features of the original model are not true anymore. As far as\nrenormalizations are concerned, we have essentially QED, with corrections coming from the scalar part mimicking the\nYukawa interactions with the \u03a64 term added. We end up with the gauge-Higgs-Yukawa system, although our starting\npoint is gauging a constrained model.\nWe also have scattering processes where two scalar particles go to an even number of scalar particles, or scattering\nof spinor particles from each other. In the one loop approximation all these diagrams give finite results, like the case\nin the standard Yukawa coupling model. We also have creation of spinor particles from the interaction of scalars, as\nwell as scattering of spinors with each other, and all the other processes in the gauge-Higgs-Yukawa system.\nIf we consider the model described in reference [24], we see that the same differences prevail. The main results are\nthe same. The only difference from the scalar model is the finiteness of the spinor box diagram with incoming and\noutgoing vector particles, [27, 28], both in the new model and the one in reference [24].\nAcknowledgement: The work of M.H. is also supported by TUBA, the Academy of Sciences of Turkey.
