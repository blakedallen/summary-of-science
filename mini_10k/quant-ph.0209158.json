The results are found to concur with the recent experiments involving\ngamma photons.\n03.65.Ud\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fQuantum non-locality in measurements involving polarization and two-photon interference of correlated photons has been experimentally confirmed at many independent laboratories [1-4]. It has been generally postulated that non-local effects may also occur in regard\nto the spatial wavefunctions of the emitted photons. As an example, detection of one of\nthe photons produced in parametric down conversion is predicted to cause \"instantaneous\"\nlocalization of the other photon, subsequently eliminating any uncertainty in the time of\narrival of the second photon at a second detector. Experimental support of this prediction\nhas been reported by Hong et al. [4]. The two-photon interference method utilized in Ref. [4]\nindicates that the minimum time uncertainty, in the time interval between detection of the\ntwo down-converted photons, is less than 100f s. This uncertainty in time is much less than\nthe coherence time of the initial pump photons, which subsequently gives strong indication\nof nonlocal collapse of the photon wave-function.\nOne may expect to observe similar nonlocal effects involving photons emitted from\npositron/electron annihilation. Recent high-resolution measurements of the time interval\nbetween the two photons emitted in positron/electron annihilation have been carried out by\nIrby [5]. The results of the measurements indicate that the absolute minimum uncertainty\nin detection time between arrival of the two photons is \u2206tQM = 117 \u00b1 9 ps, which surprisingly, agrees with the lifetime of positrons in bulk sodium (119 ps) predicted by quantum\nelectrodynamics [6] [7]. Although nonlocal effects are observed to occur in the case of down\nconverted photons, the experimental results give strong evidence against the instantaneous\nspatial-localization of gamma photons emitted from annihilation events.\nIn this paper, we present a quantum-mechanical analysis of the time interval between\ndetection of correlated photons. The analysis is basically the same as that first presented\nby Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935 [8]. The main difference, however, is\nthat we include time dependence in the quantum wavefunctions and also take into account\nrestrictions on photon momenta due to energy conservation.\nAs in the original EPR paper, we assume that the total momentum before the particles\ninteract (or are emitted) is zero. In addition, we assume that the particles interact at times\n2\n\n\ft < 0. The total wavefunction can then be written (for t \u2265 0)\nZ\n\n\u03a8(x1 , x2 , t) =\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c8p (x2 , t) up (x1 , t) dp ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere up (x1 , t) are eigenstates of particle one's momentum and energy\nup (x1 , t) = eipx1 /h\u0304 e\u2212iEt/h\u0304 .\n\n(2)\n\nIn order to conserve momentum, let us also assume\n\u03c8p (x2 , t) = e\u2212ip(x2 + xo )/h\u0304 e\u2212iEt/h\u0304 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhich are eigenstates of particle two's momentum and energy. (xo is an arbitrary constant\nintroduced in the original EPR paper. In this case, however, since we are including the\nexplicit time dependence, we will set xo = 0). Note that if a measurement of particle one's\nmomentum yields a value of p, the total wavefunction collapses to\n\u03a8(x1 , x2 , t) = \u03c8p (x2 , t) up (x1 , t) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich has momentum eigenvalues of p and \u2212p respectively for particles one and two. Before\nany measurement takes place, the total wavefunction is thus given by\n\u03a8(x1 , x2 , t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\neip(x1 \u2212 x2 )/h\u0304 e\u2212i2Et/h\u0304 dp .\n\n(5)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe total wavefunction can also be written in terms of instantaneous position eigenstates\nvx (x1 , t) of particle one\n\u03a8(x1 , x2 , t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c6x (x2 , t) vx (x1 , t) dx ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere particle two's wavefunction \u03c6x (x2 , t) has yet to be specified. Since the position eigenstates of particle one, measured at time t, are Dirac delta-functions vx (x1 , t) = \u03b4(x \u2212 x1 ),\nwith eigenvalues x1 , Eq. 6 reduces to\n\u03a8(x1 , x2 , t) = \u03c6x1 (x2 , t) ,\n3\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhere x1 now represents an eigenvalue measured at time t. Therefore, the spatial wavefunction of particle two is dependent on the position measurement x1 of particle one:\nZ\n\n\u03c6x1 (x2 , t) =\n\n\u221e\n\neip(x1 \u2212 x2 )/h\u0304 e\u2212i2Et/h\u0304 dp .\n\n(8)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nLet us first consider the case where the particles have non-zero rest mass. If particle\none's position x1 is measured at t = 0 , Eq. 8 reduces to\n\u03c6x1 (x2 , 0) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\neip(x1 \u2212 x2 )/h\u0304 dp,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c6x1 (x2 , 0) = h\u0304 \u03b4(x1 \u2212 x2 ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nresulting in particle two being localized at x2 = x1 (which is the same result as presented\nin the original EPR paper with xo = 0). If particle one's position x1 is measured at a time\nother than zero, particle two's wavefunction at the measurement time t is then explicitly\ngiven by\n\u03c6x1 (x2 , t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221a 2\n2 2\neip(x1 \u2212 x2 )/h\u0304 e\u2212i2 (pc) +(mc ) t/h\u0304 dp .\n\n(10)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThus, if particle one's position x1 is measured at a time other than t = 0, particle two\nwill not be localized. Particle two is only localized at one instant, namely t = 0. Furthermore, regardless of when particle two is localized, particle two's wavefunction will always\nimmediately and rapidly disperse as time progresses.\nIn contrast, since E = pc for photons, dispersion no longer exists. The spatial wavefunction for photons is given by\n\u03c6x1 (x2 , t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\neip(x1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 2ct)/h\u0304 dp,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c6x1 (x2 , t) = h\u0304 \u03b4(x1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 2ct).\n\n(11)\n\nThus, after measurement of photon one's location x1 at time t, photon two is instantaneously\nlocalized at x2 = x1 \u2212 2ct. In contrast with particles of non-zero rest mass, once photon two\nis localized, it will remain localized (propagating at c).\nThe result, given in Eq. 11 above, contradicts the experimental measurements. Localization of the second photon should eliminate any uncertainty in arrival time between the\n4\n\n\ftwo photons. This glaring contradiction between theory and experiment can, however, be\nelieviated by properly taking into account necessary restrictions on photon momenta.\nFor the case of positron/electron annihilation, the emitted photons are restricted to a\nsmall range of possible momenta \u2206p centered at p = mc in order for energy to be conserved.\nIn order to take into account conservation of energy, let |f (p)|2dp be the probability of\nphotons having momenta between p and p + dp. The total wavefunction is then given by\n\u03a8(x1 , x2 , t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nf (p) \u03c8p (x2 , t) up(x1 , t) dp .\n\n(12)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nOnce photon one is detected, photon two's wavefunction is then given by\n\u03c6x1 (x2 , t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nf (p) eip(x1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 2ct)/h\u0304 dp ,\n\n(13)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhich is no longer equal to a Dirac delta-function. As Eq. 13 indicates, restrictions on\nemitted photon momenta prohibits instantaneous and complete localization of the second\nphoton.\nThe prohibition on nonlocality indicated above may also be described in terms of partial\nentanglement [9] [10]. As is well known in the quantum-optics community, if a particular\nobservable is subject to physical restrictions, any other conjugate observable, associated with\na non-commuting operator, will exhibit a corresponding restriction in terms of nonlocality.\nThis can be more easily shown in terms of spin measurements.\nLet us assume that two particles are emitted such that the total spin wave function,\nmeasured along the x axis, is given by\n\u03a8x = a| \u2191i1 | \u2193i2 \u2212 b| \u2193i1 | \u2191i2 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere a2 + b2 = 1. If a = b, then individual spin measurements (along x) for either particle\nare unrestricted and completely uncertain. If a 6= b, there exists partial restriction. If\neither a or b is equal to zero, spin measurements are completely restricted. Note that the\nabove wavefunction will always exhibit maximum nonlocality (for measurements along x)\nregardless of the values of a and b. A measurement of | \u2191i1 will always yield | \u2193i2 .\n5\n\n\fParticle spin along the z axis, however, is a conjugate observable. For spin measurements\nalong the z axis, the total wavefunction can easily be shown to be\n\u03a8z\n\n1\n= \u221a | \u2191i1\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n(a + b)\n(a \u2212 b)\n\u221a | \u2191i2 \u2212 \u221a | \u2193i2\n2\n2\n\n\u001b\n\n1\n+ \u221a | \u2193i1\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n(a \u2212 b)\n(a + b)\n\u221a | \u2191i2 \u2212 \u221a | \u2193i2 .\n2\n2\n\u001b\n\n(15)\nIf a = b, observables associated with spin measurements along x are unrestricted. For\nspin measurements along z, Eq. 15 reduces to (with a = b)\n1\n1\n\u03a8z = \u2212 \u221a | \u2191i1 | \u2193i2 + \u221a | \u2193i1 | \u2191i2 .\n2\n2\n\n(16)\n\nIn this case, spin measurements along the z axis exhibit maximum nonlocality, or maximum\nentanglement.\nIn contrast, let us assume a = 0.8 and b = 0.6 In this case, spin measurements along x\nare only slightly restricted. For spin measurements along the z axis, Eq. 15 reduces to\n\u03a8z\n\n1\n= \u221a | \u2191i1 0.141| \u2191i2 \u2212 0.989| \u2193i2\n2\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\n1\n+ \u221a | \u2193i1 0.989| \u2191i2 \u2212 0.141| \u2193i2 .

If a measurement of particle one's spin yields | \u2191i1 , only 98% of the time will particle two yield\n| \u2193i2 .\nOn the other extreme, if b = 0, the observables associated with spin measurements along\nx are maximally restricted. For spin measurements along the z axis, Eq. 15 reduces to (with\nb = 0)\n\u03a8z\n\n1\n= \u221a | \u2191i1\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n1\n1\n\u221a | \u2191i2 \u2212 \u221a | \u2193i2\n2\n2\n\n\u001b\n\n1\n+ \u221a | \u2193i1\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n1\n1\n\u221a | \u2191i2 \u2212 \u221a | \u2193i2 .\n2\n2\n\u001b\n\n(18)\n\nIn this case, measurement of particle one's spin does not in any way influence the measurement of the spin of particle two. Nonlocality is erased.\nAs the above analysis indicates, measurements involving a particular observable may\nor may not exhibit nonlocality, depending upon the degree of physical restraints that may\nexist on conjugate observables. In the case of photons being emitted from positron/electron\n6\n\n\fannihilation, photon momenta are, for all practical purposes, maximally restricted. This\nthen essentially eliminates nonlocality in the conjugate position observables. Therefore\n\u25b3tQM 6= 0. (However, partial entanglement still, nonetheless, exists. In the limit of well\ndefined momenta, \u25b3tQM \u2192 \u221e for the case of no entanglement). In striking contrast,\nparametric down-converted photons exhibit a much stronger correlation in time than that\nof gamma photons. This may be attributed to the fact that down-converted photons possess\nmuch larger uncertainties in emission energy than those of gamma photons.\n\n7\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] A. Aspect, J.
