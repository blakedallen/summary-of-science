There\nare many potential advantages to implementing quantum protocols on a semiconductor chip.\nThe dipole coupling of matter to the field can be fixed because of the monolithic nature of the\ndesign. Moreover, an integrated design can be naturally coupled to other on-chip devices, both\nphotonic and electronic, and is inherently scalable. Strong coupling experiments in solid-state\ncavity QED have evolved from the 1D geometry of quantum wells in a Fabry Perot microcavity [3] to full three-dimensionally confining micropillar and photonic crystal microcavities\ncoupled to epitaxial quantum dots [4, 5]. More recently, there have been a number of significant\nadvances [6, 7, 8] in both photonic crystal cavities and microdisks.\nSingle nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers in diamond have recently emerged as promising candidates for quantum optics and quantum information [9]. They act as stable sources of\nsingle photons [10], and at room temperature, they have electron spin coherence times of 350\n\u03bc s [11] and nuclear spin coherence times of 0.5 ms. These spin states can be manipulated to\nform a quantum register [12], and coupled with reasonable strength to optical transitions such\nas the zero-phonon line (ZPL), allowing the read-out of the state [13, 14]. NV centers occur\nnaturally in bulk diamond, but their spin states can dephase in the presence of proximate nitrogen spins. Recently, techniques have been developed to artificially implant NV centers in\nhigh-purity single crystal diamond, which limits the density of substitutional nitrogen atoms\nand the associated sources of decoherence [11, 15]. Although much of this research relates to\nbulk diamond, NV centers embedded in 20 nm sized diamond nanocrystals (NCs) have also\nbeen shown to have spin coherence times on the order of microseconds [16]. Embedding these\ndiamond NCs in an optical microcavity could allow realization of the coherent light-matter\ninteractions crucial for certain quantum protocols. With an appropriately designed cavity, for\nexample, this coherence could be controlled and entangled with photon states for transfer of\nthe quantum information [17, 18, 19]. In fact, diamond NCs of about 75 nm in size have been\nstrongly coupled to the whispering gallery modes of silica microspheres [20].\nOur goal is to design a wavelength-scale microcavity for coupling to diamond NCs on a\nplanar platform, which would facilitate integration with other optical devices. A major chal-\n\n\flenge in realizing strongly-coupled diamond NV centers in this system is the fact that the ZPL\noptical transition is in the visible (637 nm for the negatively charged NV\u2212 center). A monolithic nanocavity must therefore be designed in a visibly transparent material. One option is\ndiamond, which has a reasonably high refractive index n = 2.43, and optical resonators have\nbeen designed for thin slabs of diamond [21, 22] with Q > 106 [23]. Experimentally this is\nvery challenging, as the growth of single crystal diamond slabs has yet to be realized, and\nthe polycrystalline films which are readily available suffer from large scattering losses which\nhas limited the measured Q factors to less than 1000 [24]. In bulk single crystal diamond,\nmoreover, it is difficult to realize these structures due to the considerable challenge of creating\nthree-dimensionally confining defect cavities.\nFor material systems operating in the visible, an alternative to diamond is a wide bandgap\nsemiconductor, such as silicon nitride, hafnium oxide, gallium nitride, or gallium phosphide [25]. Silicon nitride and hafnium oxide are particularly promising candidates because of\ntheir compatibility with advanced silicon nanofabrication processes. Indeed, SiNx microdisks\nhave been fabricated with Q = 3.6 \u00d7106 and mode volumes V = 15(\u03bb /n)3 [26, 27]. The moderately low refractive index of \u223c 2.0 of SiNx has often been considered an impediment to\nultra-high-Q photonic crystal nanocavity designs, which thusfar have only been demonstrated\nin high index semiconductors such as silicon [28, 29]. To wit, the highest reported photonic\ncrystal cavity design in SiNx has yielded a Q factor of 12,900 with a mode volume of 1.62\n(\u03bb /n)3 [30].\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that silicon nitride photonic crystal nanocavities can have Q\nfactors of 230,000 with mode volumes of \u223c 0.55(\u03bb /n)3. Considering the relative ease of fabrication and the natural integration of our design as part of an on-chip ridge waveguide, this\nremarkably high Q/V ratio renders this device as a highly promising platform on which to\npursue visible solid-state cavity QED. Although we focus on silicon nitride, these results are\napplicable for any low-loss material with n \u223c 2.0.\nWe first discuss our systematic approach to engineer the nanocavity, which is based on a\nseries of publications by Lalanne et al. [31, 32, 33]. We then consider the effect on the mode Q\nfactor of a diamond NC embedded in the center of the cavity or positioned on top of the cavity\nsurface, and demonstrate that a Q factor greater than 95% of the bare cavity Q is obtainable for\na realistic NC size of 20 nm. For the case of the NC on top of the cavity, we explore the effect of\nspatial location of the NC with respect to the mode center, and evaluate the effect on the mode\nQ. We then evaluate the cavity QED figures of merit and show that when the NC is embedded\nin the center of the cavity, the system is capable of realizing the strong coupling limit.\n2.\n\nCavity design\n\nBecause of the relatively low index of refraction (n = 2.0) of SiNx , the two-dimensional photonic bandgap of SiNx planar photonic crystal slabs is small, particularly when measured\nagainst a high index semiconductor like silicon. This makes the design of nanocavities in 2D\nphotonic lattices challenging [34, 30]. To circumvent this difficulty, we consider a nanocavity for which the photonic lattice provides only one dimensional (1D) confinement, and total\ninternal reflection provides the confinement mechanism in the other two dimensions (2D). In\nthese \"1D + 2\" structures, the effective 1D bandgap, or stopband, is considerably larger than the\ncorresponding 2D gap in a planar structure. For example, for the PhC considered in this paper,\nthe stop-band of the \"1D + 2\" structure spans 13% of the center frequency, whereas the \"2D +\n1\" hexagonal planar photonic crystal with the same pitch and hole radius yields a 2D bandgap\nspanning just 7% of the center frequency. The wider 1D stopband allows a greater isolation\nof our defect mode from the band edges and therefore higher Q factors in engineered defect\ncavities. Recently, a similar 1D design approach yielded a Q factor of 2 \u00d7 108 in a high-index\n\n\fNC\n\ns\n\ntaper\n\nmirror\n\nFig. 1. Sketch of the 1D photonic crystal waveguide nanocavity, showing a 60 nm diamond\nnanocrystal located on top of a cavity of length s. The taper and photonic crystal mirror\nsections are symmetric about the cavity center.\n\nmaterial (n = 3.46) [35]. A sketch of the 1D nanocavity is shown in Figure 1, which also shows\na 60 nm diamond nanocrystal positioned on top of the cavity.\nThe design process consists of engineering three elements: (a) the photonic crystal mirror,\n(b) the taper, and (c) the cavity length. We begin by considering a free-standing SiNx ridge\nwaveguide of thickness 200 nm and width 300 nm which supports a single TE mode. These\nparameters are chosen as representative of our experimental wafer, and have not been optimized\nin any fashion. The photonic crystal parameters, namely the hole spacing a and radius r, are\nchosen to center the resulting stop-band around the wavelength of interest (\u223c 637 nm). Setting\na = 250 nm and r/a = 0.28 gives a stopband over the wavelength band 593-679 nm, with a midgap wavelength of 636 nm, as required. We can characterize the reflectivity of the mirror using\nthe 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method by launching a waveguide mode pulse\nand monitoring the reflection spectrum. The reflected light is spatially integrated over a plane\nperpendicular to the waveguide placed 300 nm in front of the mirror, and the loss spectrum,\ndefined as L = 1 - R, is calculated. This spectrum quantifies the amount of light which is not\nreflected by the mirror and is lost due to transmission and scattering losses.\nAs shown by Sauvan et al. [33], the scattering losses arise in part from the mode mismatch\nbetween the waveguide and Bloch mirror modes. By tapering the mirror, the discontinuity at\nthe interface between the cavity and mirror can be smoothed, allowing for an adiabatic transition between the modes in the two regions. The mismatch can be quantified by comparing the\neffective index of the Bloch mode, \u03bb /2a = nBl = 1.274, to the effective index of the waveguide\nmode, nwg = 1.480 (determined using our 3D-FDTD mode solver [36]). To gradually taper into\nthe waveguide mode, the final segment of the mirror should support a Bloch mode such that\nnBl = neff = 1.480, which determines a1 = 214 nm. For this to work, the r/a ratio should be\nmaintained close to that of the uniform mirror, which implies r1 \u223c 60 nm. Thus, we wish to\nsmoothly taper the photonic crystal parameters (a, r) in the mirror from (250, 70) down to the\nvalues (214, 60) next to the cavity. In fact, we found an improvement by tapering the radius to\na smaller value than this rule would suggest, from 70 nm to 55 nm.\nWe gauge the efficacy of 2, 3, and 4 hole linear tapers according to the magnitude of L,\nas plotted in Figure 2. The photonic crystal mirror is 17 periods in length, which was found\nto saturate the in-waveguide Q factor of the nanocavities based on these designs, as discussed\nbelow. Each increase in the taper length has the effect of further reducing the mismatch between\nmirror and waveguide. The 4-hole taper yields a significantly improved reflectivity and hence\nlower loss, giving a minimum mirror loss L < 0.003.\nThe nanocavity is defined by the gap s between two taper/mirror sections, as shown in Fig. 1.\nIn the 3D-FDTD simulation, the cavity is excited with several randomly phased and positioned\ndipole sources, and the Q factor is determined from the exponential decay of the electric field\nringdown in the cavity. We also verified the Q factors by monitoring the power absorbed by\nthe simulation boundaries, as discussed below, and these agree well with the ringdown values.\nTo accurately model in a 3D-FDTD simulation the exact taper and cavity length dimensions to\n\n\f10\n\nLoss = 1 - R\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\ntaper 4\ntaper 3\ntaper 2\nno taper\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\na1 a2 a\nr1 r2\n\n...\n\nr\n\nmirror\n-3\n\n10\n560\n\ntaper\n\n580\n\n600\n\n620\n640\n660\nWavelength (nm)\n\n680\n\n700\n\nFig. 2. Loss parameter for 4 different designs of photonic crystal mirrors. The Q factors for\nthe best nanocavities designed for each taper are (13,000; 22,900; 230,000) for the (2; 3;\n4)-section tapers, respectively. The inset defines the hole pitch (a) and radii (r). The 4-hole\ntaper parameters (in nm) are (r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 ) = (55, 58, 62, 66) and (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) = (214, 226,\n238, 250).\n\nthe scale of nanometers while maintaining tractable simulation times, we use a graded mesh\napproach. The mesh grid size is 5 nm in the central 0.4 \u00d7 0.4 \u00d7 0.4 \u03bc m simulation volume.\nOutside this region, the mesh grid spacing is 10 nm for the dielectric waveguide (corresponding\nto 25 points per photonic lattice spacing), and is nonlinearly graded with distance in free-space\naway from the dielectric material. We verified the convergence of the graded mesh simulation\nwith a 5 nm grid uniformly meshed simulation.\nWe consider cavities formed by the 4-segment tapered mirrors, which gave the highest reflectivity in the above analysis. The dependence of the Q factor on the nanocavity length s is\nillustrated in Figure 3. The maximum Q obtained is 230,000 for s = 95 nm. This is nearly 20\ntimes better than the highest value reported in the literature to date [30]. In these simulations,\nwe have not considered material absorption, which was shown by Barclay et al. [26, 37] to be\na limiting factor in SiNx only for Q factors in the range of a few million, or scattering due to\nfabrication imperfections. Further optimization may be possible by optimizing the waveguide\nwidth and thickness, as well as using different (e.g. longer) taper forms.\nThe mode volume is plotted as the green trace in Figure 3. The cavity with the maximum Q\nhas a mode volume \u223c 0.55(\u03bb /n)3. Despite the relatively low refractive index of SiNx , this is\nhalf the effective mode volume of the recent ultra-high-Q photonic crystal cavities designed in\nhigh index semiconductors [28, 29, 35], demonstrating the highly attractive ultra-small size of\nthese 1D nanocavities.\nThe mechanism which yields the high Q factor in the 4-hole tapered nanocavities is more\nsubtle than a simple reduction of mirror loss compared to the shorter tapers. As shown in Figure 2, the loss of the 2-hole taper is improved by a factor of \u223c 3 in the 4-hole taper, but the\nQ factor of the optimal cavity based on each design is increased by a factor of almost 20.

Quality factor and effective mode volume as a function of cavity length for a freestanding PhC ridge waveguide in SiNx with a 4-hole taper and 17 period mirror. The cavity\nmode electric field Ey distribution is shown.\n\na Fabry-Perot cavity, one would expect the Q factor to be proportional to the inverse loss. The\ndifference here is that the cavity mode is derived from the propagating Bloch modes of the\nphotonic crystal mirror, and the local structural perturbation which forms the cavity introduces\na mode gap [35, 28] capable of supporting very high Q modes. Recently, we used a similar\napproach to design cavities based on semiconductor nanowires with Q \u223c 106 [38]. The tapered transition from the mirror to the nanocavity not only reduces mirror loss in the simple\nFabry-Perot picture, but reduces radiative loss arising from delocalization of the mode profile\nin k-space [39]. There may also be a role played by radiation modes in recycling the mirror\nlosses and increasing the Q factor, as elaborated by Lalanne et al. in Ref. [32].\nFor a given structure, the Q factor can be separated into in-waveguide, Qwg , and perpendicular, Q\u22a5 components using the relation 1/QT = 1/Qwg + 1/Q\u22a5 (in analogy to the Qk , Q\u22a5\ndivision common in the analysis of 2D PhC microcavities [40]). Qwg is calculated by measuring\nthe power absorbed at the boundary of the simulation within one half-wavelength of the surface\nof the waveguide, Pwg , and then using the definition of the Quality factor, Qwg = \u03c9 W /Pwg ,\nwhere W is the electromagnetic energy in the resonant mode. Q\u22a5 is then determined from\nQwg and the total QT . For a 17 period mirror, QT = Q\u22a5 , indicating that the waveguide losses\nhave saturated and the total losses are completely determined by out-of-waveguide loss. With a\nshorter photonic crystal mirror, the total Q drops as it is limited by in-waveguide losses. With\n11 periods in the mirror, QT is reduced to about half the maximum value. This provides a guide\n\n\ffor the design of an integrated in-waveguide emitter, in which light trapped or emitted into the\nnanocavity would couple predominantly into the waveguide mode rather than scattering off the\nridge. This was the approach of Zain et al. [41], who designed a \u223c 6 period PhC mirror in\na silicon-on-insulator ridge waveguide and experimentally demonstrated a Q factor of 18,500\nwith a transmission of 85%.\n3.\n\nIncorporation of a diamond nanocrystal\n\nNow that we have optimized our photonic crystal nanocavity design, we consider exploiting\nthis nanocavity to enhance the zero-phonon line (ZPL) emission from a NV center in a diamond\nnanocrystal. Coupling the emission to the nanocavity mode will lead to a Purcell enhancement\nof the spontaneous emission rate, and as we show below, the potential to realize quantum dynamics in the strong coupling regime.\nThe ideal placement of the diamond NC is in the middle of the nanocavity, where the NV\ncenter can interact with the maximal electric field of the cavity mode. It is important to quantify\nthe effect of the NC on the cavity Q factor. As in the bare (unperturbed) cavity 3D-FDTD\nsimulations, a 5 nm mesh is used in the central volume of the simulation in order to accurately\nmodel the effects of the small volume of diamond. We consider 20 nm and 40 nm sized cubic\ndiamond NCs. Interestingly, the results reveal that the Q factor is not uniformly affected for\nall cavities. For cavities longer than 95 nm incorporating a 20 nm NC, the Q decreases by 1012%, but for cavities shorter than this, the Q factor is actually increased. In the best cavity (s\n= 95 nm), the bare Q factor of 230,000 increases to 240,000 with the 20 nm NC. These results\nperhaps reflect a trade-off between the beneficial impact of the increased refractive index in\nthe cavity center, which would be expected to raise the Q factor, and the deleterious effect of\nchanging the impedance matching condition used to design the mirror tapers. As expected with\nthe higher index cavity core, there is a reduction of about 10% in the mode volume for all\ncavity lengths. We conducted a similar investigation for a 40 nm cubic diamond NC located at\nthe cavity center, and found that the Q vs. s curve shifts to shorter cavities compared to Fig. 3,\nyielding a peak Q = 260, 000 at s = 90 nm, with a mode volume of 0.50 (\u03bb /n)3. The main\nconclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is that the cavity Q factors are not changed by\nmore than about 10% from the bare cavity values. The highest Q factor can still be achieved,\nand even slightly improved, and the mode volumes are slightly reduced.\nExperimentally, an embedded NC might be realized by depositing a 100 nm layer of SiNx\non a sacrificial layer of SiO2 , placing a single diamond NC in a known position, and then\ndepositing another 100 nm layer of SiNx to cap the structure and embed the NC in the middle.\nThe NC position could be registered with respect to external alignment markers [42], or the\nposition might be revealed after the SiNx regrowth by a bump on the top surface [43]. The\nPhC nanocavity would then be patterned around the NC, followed by removal of the SiO2 . We\nsimulated the scenario of a small 20 nm bump of SiNx on top of the cavity with an embedded\n20 nm NC, and found a reduction of only about 2% in the Q factor of the best cavity.\nAn alternate approach to embedding a diamond NC would be to position the NC on top of\nthe cavity. In [44], Koenderink et al. consider the emission enhancement of a dipole right at the\nsemiconductor/air interface of a uniform slab 2D photonic crystal, and show that the rate can\nbe enhanced by 5 - 10 times near the band edges. Here we model a similar scenario, except\nthe emitter is situated on the top surface of our SiNx nanocavity. The high Q/V ratio of our\nnanocavity presents the possibility to yield much higher emission enhancements, as elaborated\nbelow, with a maximum Purcell factor of 1,800 for the NC on top, and 27,000 for the cavity\nwith an embedded NC.\nWe consider diamond NC cubes with 3 different edge lengths: 20 nm, 40 nm, and 60 nm, and\nconsider the effect of such a NC placed exactly above the central anti-node of the nanocavity\n\n\fmode. We explore the effect on the mode Q factor of this small dielectric perturbation (n =\n2.43), and analyze the sensitivity of the Q to the precise positioning of the NC. The cavity\ndesign for these simulations had a maximum Q of 115,000 (s = 100 nm), which was not the\noptimal design (s = 95 nm).\nThe simulations are repeated for a range of NC positions to model the effect of imperfect\nNC placement, and the results are summarized in Figure 4. The NC position is varied over a\ndisplacement of 40 nm in the x-direction and 60 nm in the y-direction with respect to the center\nof the cavity, as shown by the white box in Fig. 4(a).\n4\n\nx 10\n2.5\n4\n\nx 10\n\nQ factor\n\n3\n\ny\n\n2\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n1\n\n0\n\nx\n\n0\n\n100\nnm\n\n60\n\nx (nm) 20\n20\n\n40\n\n40\ny (nm)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n0.5\n\n(b)\n4\n\nx 10\n4\n\n10\n\n4\n\nx 10\n\nx 10\n\n7\n\n15\n\n4\n\n8\n\nx 10\n\nQ factor\n\n5\n5\n\nQ factor\n\n6\n\n10\n\n10\n6\n5\n\n4\n3\n\n0\n2\n0\nx (nm)\n\n60\n\n20\n\n40\n20\n\n40\n0\n\n(c)\n\ny (nm)\n\n4\n\n0\n0\n60\n\nx (nm) 20\n1\n0\n\n2\n\n40\n20\n\n40\n0\n\ny (nm)\n\n0\n\n(d)\n\nFig. 4. Effect on the mode Q factor of a single diamond nanocrystal cube (n = 2.43) of\nvarying size and displacement placed on top of the s = 100 nm nanocavity, which has a\nmaximum unperturbed Q of this cavity is 115,000 (see Fig. 3). The white box in (a) shows\nthe range over which the nanocrystal is positioned, and the bar images show the Q factor\nas a function of position for NCs of size (b) 60 nm (c) 40 nm and (d) 20 nm. (x, y) = (0,0)\ndenotes the nanocavity center (top surface).\n\nThe results show that while the relatively large 60 nm diamond NCs have a significant impact\non the mode Q, the situation is very promising for 40 nm and 20 nm sized NCs. The on-center Q\nfactor is 47,100 for a 40 nm NC, and as the position is moved away in either the x or y directions\nfrom the mode center, the Q factor increases to a maximum of almost 74,000 at (x, y)= (40,60)\nnm. Of course, for positions away from the central anti-node of the mode, the electric field\nstrength is lower, reducing the coupling of the NC to the cavity. There will thus be a trade-off\nbetween Q and field strength.\nFor a 20 nm diamond NC, the Q factor is close to 105 , or about 90% of the maximum\nunperturbed Q of the cavity, regardless of NC position. We note that Jelezko et al. [16] observed\n\n\f1.5 to 2 \u03bc s spin coherence times in 20 nm sized nanocrystallites of diamond. Our results show\nthat an NC of this size has little effect on our cavity mode Q factor whether it is embedded in\nthe middle or positioned on top, and therefore is a very promising candidate for cavity QED\nexperiments.\n4.\n\nCavity QED analysis\n\nTo achieve strong coupling between a diamond NV center and a cavity, the coherent interaction\nrate, or vacuum Rabi frequency g, must exceed the decoherence rates due to the cavity loss,\n\u03ba , and the spontaneous emission rate, \u03b3 ; i.e., g > \u03ba , \u03b3 .

Maxwell's equations dictate that the normal component of the electric field at the interface between two materials (labeled 1 and 2) satisfies the\nboundary condition \u03b51 E1 = \u03b52 E2 . For the small perturbation posed by a sub-wavelength sized\ndiamond nanocrystal, this picture will be more complicated than for a single interface between\ntwo bulk dielectrics (in which case the field would be scaled down by a factor (2/2.43)2 = 0.68\nin the higher index diamond NC). We can again determine \u03b7 precisely from FDTD simulations,\nand for a 20 nm diamond NC at the middle of the cavity, \u03b7 = 0.85.\nFor each cavity (see e.g. Fig. 3, we are now in a position to calculate the relevant cavity QED\nfigures of merit, given by the three angular frequencies:\ng\n\n\u03ba\n\u03b3\n\n= \u03b7 g0 ,\n\u03c9\n=\n,\n2Q\n= 2\u03c0 /20ns.\n\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nIn a diamond NV center, the zero-phonon line only contributes about 5% of the total emission, the rest being emitted into the phonon sideband [10].

The spontaneous emission rate \u03b3 is independent\nof cavity length. The Rabi frequency has a weak dependence on cavity length through \u03c90 and\nV , both of which change slowly with length. The cavity field decay rate, \u03ba , obviously depends\nstrongly on cavity length, as it is proportional to 1/Q. When the NC is placed on top of the\ncavity (black dashed line), the condition g > \u03ba , \u03b3 is not quite satisfied for the highest Q cavity.\nWhen the NC is embedded in the cavity (green line), however, the strong coupling condition\nis satisfied for cavities with lengths s = 90 \u2212 100 nm. At 95 nm, the single-atom cooperativity\nfor an embedded NC is Ce = g2e /\u03ba\u03b3 = 90, which is a promising figure-of-merit describing the\nstrength of the matter-field interaction. For the NC on top of the cavity, Ct = 6.\n\n\fIn the weak coupling, or \"bad cavity\" regime, in which the rate of cavity decoherence \u03ba\nexceeds the coupling rate g0 , the spontaneous emission rate will be strongly enhanced by the\nPurcell effect. At a temperature of 1.8 K, the emission linewidth of the ZPL corresponds to a\nQ factor of a few 107 [48], which is much narrower than the cavity line, signifying that the full\nZPL can be strongly enhanced given optimal coupling with the cavity mode. For the 95 nm\ncavity with an embedded diamond NC, the Purcell factor Fp = 3Q\u03b7 2 (\u03bb /n)3 /4\u03c0 2V = 27000,\nassuming the full spectral and polarization alignment of the NV transition dipole moment with\nthe anti-node of the cavity mode. The relative field strength \u03b7 at the NC position enters as a\nsquared factor [46]. If the NC is positioned on top of the 95 nm cavity, the maximum attainable\nPurcell factor is about 1,800. The cavity is thus a highly promising device to enhance the photon\nproduction rate from an NV center.\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we have engineered a high-Q/V SiNx photonic crystal nanocavity with n = 2.0 for\nthe purpose of strongly coupling the cavity mode with a single NV center in a 20 nm diamond\nnanocrystal. The structure should be relatively straightforward to fabricate, as the process is\nbased on well-known nanofabrication techniques, and it naturally integrates the cavity with an\non-chip ridge waveguide, allowing a well-defined output channel to be engineered for photons\nconfined in the cavity mode [49]. This could be achieved either by shortening the photonic\nmirror to decrease the in-waveguide Q factor, or by applying a Q-spoiling pulse to inject free\ncarriers into the cavity, as has been demonstrated in recent work on dynamic perturbations in\nphotonic nanocavities [50, 51]. We have demonstrated a cavity Q factor of 230,000 with an\neffective mode volume of 0.55 (\u03bb /n)3, and shown that a 20 nm diamond nanocrystal located\non the cavity surface reduces the Q by only \u223c 10%. The same NC embedded in the middle\nof the cavity increases the Q factor while reducing the mode volume. By calculating the Rabi\nfrequency and comparing this to the decoherence rates of the system, we have shown that the\ncavity with an embedded NC can operate in the strong coupling regime for realistic parameters.\nWe anticipate these results will open new avenues for photonic crystal-based visible photonics\nin both classical and quantum domains.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Darrick E.
