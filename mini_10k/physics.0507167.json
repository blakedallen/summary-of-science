A. Korshunov\nLV Kirensky Institute of Physics, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Science, Krasnoyarsk,\n660036 Russia\nE-mail: mkor@iph.krasn.ru\nAbstract: The carried out polarization examinations of C10H8 spectrums of small frequencies of\na Raman effect of light has revealed the presence of additional lines of small intensity.\nCalculation of histograms of spectrums of the lattice oscillations is carried out by Dyne's\nmethod. It is shown, that the presence of vacancies in structure of C10H8 leads to occurrence of\nadditional lines around 90 cm-1. Occurrence of lines at frequencies less then 30 cm-1 is attributed\nto the presence of orientation disorder of molecules. Apparently, structure C10H8 has both types\nof defects, both orientation disorder of molecules and vacancies, which causes occurrence of\nadditional lines in a spectrum of small frequencies.\nPACS: 78.30.E; 61.72.J; 61.66.H; 78.30.J\nResearch\ntechniques\nof\nspectral\nproperties of ideal molecular crystals\ndeveloped well enough. Actual crystals have\nvarious defects which presence affects\ncrystal's physical properties. At present\ntime, similar organic crystals of low\nsymmetry find the increasing application in\nmolecular electronics. Perceptivity of use of\nsimilar crystals for record and information\nprocessing is remarked. At the same time,\none of the restrictions, interfering\ndiminution of the sizes of the information\nrecord area, is bound to the presence of\ndiffusion in a sample. Presence of diffusion\n\ncan be caused by presence of vacancies.\nBefore studying migration of molecules it is\nnecessary to determine presence of\nvacancies in the given substance. A\nperspective method that determines the\npresence of vacancies in substance, can be\nRaman scattering of light with of small\nfrequencies, because the presence of\nvacancies in a crystal affects the lattice\noscillations and will be observed in\nspectrums [1]. Thus it is better to carry out\nsuch examination on objects well\ninvestigated by various methods.\n\nTable. Frequencies of orientation oscillations and their symmetries for C10H8.\nFrequency,cm-1\n46.0\n51.5\n71.5\n73.5\n107.5\n123.5\nType\nBg\nAg\nBg\nAg\nAg\nBg\nIn the present work calculations of\nspectrums of the lattice oscillations at\npresence of vacancies in the structure are\ncarried out and comparisons with the\nexperimental spectrums obtained by\npolarization\nexaminations\nis\ndone.\nPreviously, using the same approach for\nparasubstituted benzole [2] it has been\nshown, that the presence of vacancies results\nin occurrence of additional lines of small\nintensity near of 70 cm-1. In this paper\nanalogous examinations for naphthalene\ncrystals (C10H8) are given.\nAccording to X-ray diffraction data [3]\nC10H8 crystallizes in centrosymmetric space\n\ngroup P21/a with two molecules in a unit\ncell. In the calculations of frequency\nspectrums the molecular structure is\nsupposed to be absolutely rigid. Interaction\nbetween molecules was described using\nmethod of atom-atom potentials [4].\nCalculations were carried out with use of\nDyne's method [5]. This method allows to\ncarry out calculations of frequency\nspectrums of disordered molecular crystals.\nAs a result, the histograms that show\nprobability of appearance of spectral lines in\nthe picked frequency interval have been\nobtained.\n\n\fSpectrums of the lattice oscillations\nC10H8 were studied by various authors [6, 7].\nIn these papers the six intensive lines of\norientational oscillations of molecules were\nfound in the spectrum, but additional lines of\nsmall intensity were not observed.\nAccording to IR absorption data [8],\ntranslational oscillations have values 66.0\nand 96.0 cm-1.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPolarization examinations of spectrums\nC10H8 at temperature 290 K, carried out in\nthe present paper, also shown that in a\nspectrum there are six intensive lines and a\nseries of lines of small intensity are\nobserved. In figures 1a and 1b components\n(XZ) and (YZ) of the polarized spectrums of\nC10H8 are presented. Frequencies of\nintensive lines are presented in the Table.\nAlso a series of additional lines of small\nintensity 14.5, 27.5, 31.0, 90.0, and 96.0 cm1\nis observed.\nFor an explanation of occurrence of\nadditional lines in a spectrum of the lattice\noscillations of C10H8, calculations are\ncarried out. Occurrence of these lines can be\ndetermined by the presence of orientation\ndisorder of molecules or by the presence of\nvacancies.\nIn figure 1c the histogram of spectrum\nC10H8 obtained by Dyne's method with\norientation disorder taken into account, but\nwithout vacancies. It is clear, that additional\nlines in area below 30 cm-1 appeared and\nsome lines are broadened, but there are no\nlines in the area of 90.0 cm-1.\nBeside the orientation disorder the\nvacancies could be present in the crystal\nstructure. Results of calculations for this\ncase are presented in figure 1d. A one can\nsee from the figure, on a histogram there are\nadditional lines about 90.0 cm-1, and\nbroadening of some lines, but lines in the\narea lower then 25 cm-1 are not present.\nThus we assume, that the presence of\nvacancies in the structure of C10H8 affects\noccurrence of additional lines in the field of\n90 cm-1. Occurrence of lines in the area\nlower then 30 cm-1 is determined by the\npresence of orientation disorder of\nmolecules. For both cases broadening of the\nlines\ncorresponding\nto\norientation\noscillations is found. Hence, the structure of\nC10H8 has both types of defects, both\norientation disorder of molecules and\nvacancies, which causes occurrence of\nadditional lines in a spectrum of small\nfrequencies.\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A.
