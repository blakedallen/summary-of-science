However, measurements of the neutron electric\ndipole moment have placed a restrictive upper bound on\nthis term's coefficient, \u03b8\u0304 \u2264 10\u22129 [1]. The unnatural smallness of \u03b8\u0304 is known as the strong CP problem.\nA massless up quark (mu = 0) has long been proposed\nas a potential elegant solution to the problem. Chiral\nrotations of the quark mass matrix M shift \u03b8\u0304,\n\u03b8\u0304 = \u03b8 + arg det M ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a fundamental parameter of the Standard\nModel. However, if mu = 0, then det M = 0 and\narg det M is unphysical, leaving one free to remove the\nCP violating term through a simple field redefinition.\nAt leading order, Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT)\nappears to rule out the possibility of mu = 0. The quark\nmass ratios, including mu /md , can be determined using\nChPT's LO predictions for the light meson masses.\nAt NLO, however, new coefficients appear in the chiral\nexpansion which contribute to the meson masses. The\nparameters of ChPT are no longer fully determined by\nexperimental data. In fact, it is impossible for ChPT to\ndistinguish between the effects of a non-zero up quark\nmass and certain large NLO corrections. This is known\nas the Kaplan-Manohar ambiguity [2].\nDistinguishing between a light and a massless up quark\nrequires knowledge of the coefficients of the NLO terms\nin the chiral Lagrangian, the Gasser-Leutwyler (GL) coefficients. Specifically, it is the combination of constants\n2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 [22] which appears in \u2206M , the NLO correction\nto the quark mass ratios [3]. If this combination falls\nwithin a certain range, \u22123.3 < 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 < \u22121.5, current\nexperimental results can not rule out mu = 0.\nVarious assumptions and phenomenological arguments\nhave been used in the past to assemble a somewhat standard set of values for the coefficients [4]. However, because these coefficients are physically determined by the\nlow-energy non-perturbative behavior of QCD, the lattice offers the best opportunity for a truly first-principles\ncalculation.\n\npqChPT [5, 6] is the tool through which one can calculate the GL coefficients on the lattice. pqChPT is distinct\nfrom standard ChPT in that it is constructed from the\nsymmetry of a graded group. This graded group follows\nfrom the presumed quark content of partially quenched\nQCD (pqQCD): separate valence and sea quark flavors\nin addition to ghost quark flavors, which in perturbation\ntheory cancel loop corrections due to valence quarks.\nThe Lagrangian of pqChPT up to O(p4 ) follows, with\nonly relevant NLO terms shown.\nL =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 f2\n\u0002\n\u0003\nf2\nsTr \u2202\u03bc U \u2202 \u03bc U \u2020 \u2212\nsTr \u03c7U \u2020 + U \u03c7\n4\n\u0003 4 \u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n+ L4 sTr \u2202\u03bc U \u2202 \u03bc U \u2020 sTr \u03c7U \u2020 + U \u03c7\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\n+ L5 sTr \u2202\u03bc U \u2202 \u03bc U \u2020 \u03c7U \u2020 + U \u03c7\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212 L6 sTr \u03c7U \u2020 + U \u03c7 sTr \u03c7U \u2020 + U \u03c7\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212 L8 sTr \u03c7U \u2020 \u03c7U \u2020 + U \u03c7U \u03c7 + * * * ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere U = exp (2i\u03a6/f ), \u03c7 = 2\u03bca\u22121 diag ({mS , mV }), \u03a6\ncontains the pseudo-Goldstone \"mesons\" of the spontaneously broken SU (Nf + NV |NV )L \u2297 SU (Nf + NV |NV )R\nsymmetry, and U is an element of that group. mS and\nmV refer to the bare lattice quark mass parameters,\nwhich are related to their dimensionful equivalents via\nthe lattice spacing, mdim\n= a\u22121 mx .

The constants f , \u03bc, and\nthe Li 's are unknown, determined by the low-energy dynamics of pqQCD.\nBecause the valence and sea quark mass dependence\nof the Lagrangian of pqChPT is explicit and full QCD\nis within the parameter space of pqQCD (mV = mS ),\nthe values obtained for the GL coefficients in a pqQCD\ncalculation are the exact values for the coefficients in full\nQCD [7, 8]. Furthermore, independent variation of valence and sea quark masses allows additional lever arms\nin the determination the the coefficients.

However, our use of staggered fermions on somewhat coarse lattices generates significant flavor symmetry\nbreaking, and thus a splitting of the light meson masses.\nA detailed analysis of this effect with dynamical quarks\nwas recently presented in [10].\nIn order to study this error, we applied hypercubic\nblocking to several of our ensembles, using the blocking\ncoefficients found in [11]. Because hypercubic blocked\ndynamical quarks were not used when generating these\nensembles, we are using different Dirac operators for the\nvalence and sea quarks. While this procedure may not\nhave a clean continuum limit, it is still useful for estimating the systematic error due to flavor symmetry breaking.\nThe ensembles were generated using staggered\nfermions via the inexact HMD R-algorithm [12], which\nallows one to work at Nf = 3, but involves taking the\n\n\f3\n1.1\n\n3\n\n8 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.115 mS = 0.015 hyp\n2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 = 0.3439(76)\n3\n81.1x 32 \u03b2 = 5.1235 mS = 0.02 hyp\n2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 = 0.3817(87)\n3\n\n8 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.132 mS = 0.025 hyp\n2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 = 0.4150(91)\n\n1.05\n\n3\n\nRM\n\n8 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.151 mS = 0.035 hyp\n1.05\n2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 = 0.4704(94)\n\nRM\n\n1\n3\n\n2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15\n\n1\n0.1\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\nmS /mK\n0.3 0.4\n\n16 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.3 mS = 0.01 hyp\n2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 = 0.287(18)\n\n0.5\n\n3\n\n16 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.8 Q hyp\n\n0.4\n\n0.95\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 = 0.231(31)\n\n0.95\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.3\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nmV /mK\n\n1\n\nmV /mK\n\nFIG. 3: 83 \u00d7 32, several values of \u03b2 and mS with matched\nlattice spacing, hypercubic blocked.\n3\n4\n\nroot of the quark determinant. The result is a quark\naction which is non-local at finite lattice spacing, but\nshould become local in the continuum limit.\nTo determine the value of 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 , the local pseudoscalar correlator was calculated using several valence\nquark masses. The correlators were fit to exponentials,\nwhile the meson mass and decay constants were simultaneously fit to the predicted forms. The results of the fit\nare the values \u03bc, f , \u03b15 , and 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 . Figure 1 displays\nan example of one such fit.\nWhen fitting, a chiral cutoff point in the valence quark\nmass beyond which one expects pqChPT to break down\nmust be chosen. To choose our cutoff, we added mV\nvalues to our fit keeping mV /mK \u2264 1 and keeping\n\u03c72 /dof \u2248 1. The cutoff determined for the 163 \u00d7 32\nhypercubic blocked ensemble, in terms of mV /mK , was\nused for all of the \u03b2 = 5.3, mS = 0.01 ensembles. mK\ndenotes an ensemble's valence quark mass at which the\nmass of the lightest pseudoscalar meson with degenerate\nquarks equals the physical kaon mass. We found 2\u03b18 \u2212\u03b15\nto be very sensitive to our cutoff choice. For the 163 \u00d7 32\nhypercubic blocked ensemble, changing the chiral cutoff\nby \u00b10.14 in mV /mK shifted 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 by \u00b10.12.\nFigures 2-4 display the quantity\nRM =\n\nM\u03c02 (mS )mV\nM\u03c02 (mV )mS\n\n(5)\n\nsuggested by [13]. This quantity accentuates the NLO\nterms in M\u03c02 , as is evident by comparing Figure 1 to Figures 2-4. It should be noted, however, that the full forms\nof M\u03c02 and f\u03c0 , (3) and (4), were used when fitting. When\ncalculating RM , we did not use the simplification shown\nin [13], but rather used a full numerator and denominator.\nFor each of the plots, the data points are the result\nof individual fits of the correlator at each valence quark\n\nFIG. 4: 163 \u00d732, hypercubic blocked with similar lattice spacings. The circles and dashed curve (diamonds and solid curve)\nare fully (partially) quenched. The quenched data were fit as\nthough partially quenched with ms = 0.01, Nf = 3.\n\nmass, with jackknife error bars. The curves display the\nresult of a simultaneous fit of all the correlators below a\ncutoff in mV /mK to the predicted forms of M\u03c02 and f\u03c0 ,\n(3) and (4), with jackknife error bounds. Solid symbols\nare used below the cutoff, while open symbols are used\nbeyond it. Because of our small ensemble sizes, the full\ncorrelation matrix for many of the ensembles proved to\nbe nearly singular. Thus, several of the fits do not fully\naccount for data correlation.\nWe determined the lattice spacing of our ensembles via\nthe static quark potential, using a tree-level corrected\nCoulomb term. The form of this term for hypercubic\nblocked ensembles was taken from [14].\n\nRESULTS\n\nFigure 2 presents RM for the 163 \u00d7 32 ensemble both\nbefore and after hypercubic blocking. The application of\nhypercubic blocking altered results significantly, suggesting that the effect of flavor symmetry breaking at these\nlattice spacings is significant. The dashed-dotted curve\nuses the results from the hypercubic blocked ensemble's\nfit, but replaces the value found for 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 with one\nconsistent with a zero up quark mass. The data clearly\nfall well outside this range.\nTo estimate the finite volume error in our result, we repeated the calculation in a smaller 122 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 32 volume,\nholding all other parameters fixed. Fitting this ensemble with the same chiral cutoff as the 163 \u00d7 32 ensemble\nresulted in the value 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 = 0.226 \u00b1 0.064. This\nmatches our quoted result, suggesting that the finite volume of our 163 \u00d7 32 ensemble is not a large source of\nsystematic error.\nFigure 3 presents RM for several ensembles with a variety of sea quark masses and matched lattice spacing.\n\n\f4\n1\n\n0\n\n2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15\n\nUKQCD Collaboration (Nf = 2)\n-1\n\n3\n\n8 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.115 mS = 0.015 hyp\n3\n\n8 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.1235 mS = 0.02 hyp\n3\n\n8 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.132 mS = 0.025 hyp\n-2\n\n3\n\n8 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.151 mS = 0.035 hyp\n2\n\n12 x 16 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.3 mS = 0.01 hyp\n3\n\n-3\n\n16 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.3 mS = 0.01 hyp\n3\n\n16 x 32 \u03b2 = 5.3 mS = 0.01\nmu = 0\n\nto \u2206M = \u22120.0897 \u00b1 0.0313 and mu /md = 0.484 \u00b1 0.027,\nwhere the quoted error arises primarily from the systematic error of our measurement. The error from experimental input is negligible and the size of NNLO\ncorrections to \u2206M are assumed to be on the order of\n\u22062M . Using the values for the electromagnetic contributions to the light meson masses from [19] in place of\nDashen's rule results in \u2206M = \u22120.0898 \u00b1 0.0313 and\nmu /md = 0.410 \u00b1 0.036. This can be compared to\nprevious calculations in the literature, which have given\nmu /md = 0.553 \u00b1 0.043 [20] and mu /md = 0.46 \u00b1 0.09\n[21].\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n-4\n\nFIG. 5: Compiled results. The UKQCD Collaboration data\npoint is taken from [15], showing their statistical error only.\nThis point was calculated using Nf = 2 Wilson fermions, and\nthus its relative agreement suggests small Nf dependence.\nThe rightmost point denotes the range allowed by mu = 0.\n\nThe physical volume of these lattices is similar to the\nphysical volume of our 163 \u00d7 32 ensemble. The Columbia\ngroup has determined several values of the critical \u03b2c and\nmc for the Nf = 3, Nt = 4 finite temperature transition\n[16]. These ensembles were generated using those bare\nparameters. The trend in 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 with the changing\nsea quark mass is inset in Figure 3. This trend can be\nattributed to the sea quark mass dependence which was\ndropped from Equations 3 and 4. A systematic study\nof this dependence would allow a determination of the\nparameter within the dropped term, 2\u03b16 \u2212 \u03b14 [17].\nFully quenched and partially quenched ChPT predict\ndifferent forms for RM . Thus, one might hope to see the\neffects of quenching though an ensemble's RM plot. Figure 4 shows the 163 \u00d7 32 partially quenched hypercubic\nblocked ensemble along side a fully quenched ensemble\nwith similar lattice spacing. The quenched ensemble was\nanalyzed as though partially quenched, using mS = 0.01,\nNf = 3. This procedure does not generate a rigorous\nvalue for 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 , as this would require the use of fully\nquenched ChPT. However, it could offer insight into the\nmagnitude of quenching effects. As Figure 4 shows, the\neffects of quenching are not pronounced. This analysis,\nat its current level of precision, is unable to distinguish\na fully quenched ensemble from a partially quenched ensemble of equal lattice spacing.\nThe results for 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 from each ensemble are compiled in Figure 5. While these values vary significantly,\nthey do so well outside the range required for a zero up\nquark mass, \u22123.3 < 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 < \u22121.5. Our quoted result of 2\u03b18 \u2212 \u03b15 = 0.287 \u00b1 0.018stat \u00b1 0.18syst comes from\nour hypercubic blocked 163 \u00d7 32 ensemble, where the reported systematic error is the result of adding in quadrature the determined effects of shifting the chiral cutoff\n(\u00b10.12), hypercubic blocking (\u00b10.05), doubling the lattice spacing (\u00b10.11), and reducing the lattice volume\n(\u00b10.06).
