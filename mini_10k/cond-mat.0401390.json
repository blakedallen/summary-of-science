Finitedifference time-domain calculations, some explicitly including a model of the NSOM tip,\nare used to interpret the results. We find the holes act as point-like sources of SPP's and\ndemonstrate that the interference between the SPP and a directly transmitted wave allows\nfor the determination of the wavelength, phase, and decay length of the SPP. The nearfield intensity patterns can be manipulated by varying the angle and polarization of the\nincident beam.\n\n1\n\n\fLight manipulation on a sub-wavelength scale is desirable for nanophotonics\napplications. This could be achieved by developing nanostructures that transfer, turn,\nsplit, or tune light intensity via coupling to intrinsic electromagnetic (EM) modes in these\nstructures. In this regard, surface plasmon polaritons (SPP's) are intrinsic EM modes of\ngreat interest [1,2]. SPP's localize and amplify light near metal surfaces and result, for\nexample, in strong transmission enhancement through sub-wavelength holes in periodic\nstructures [2,3].\nWe study SPP generation at isolated nano-scale holes in metal (Au) films, which could\nform building blocks of more complex photonic structures. We use near-field scanning\noptical microscopy (NSOM) to show that the holes act as point-like sources of SPP's.\nInterference with directly transmitted light through the film allows us to determine the\nwavelength, phase, and decay length of the SPP's. The SPP's propagate in directions\ndetermined by the polarization of the incident beam with an intensity decay length of d \u2248\n1.0 \u03bcm. The resulting light patterns can be controlled by changing the polarization and\nangle of incidence of the illuminating beam. The experimental features are reproduced in\nfinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations [4]. Calculations with and without a\nprobe model show that the NSOM images reflect the unperturbed Poynting vector normal\nto the surface.\nThe experiments are on 100 nm thick Au films sputtered onto 380-\u03bcm fused quartz\nsubstrates. Individual holes of 200 nm diameter are created by focused ion beam milling.\nA near-field scanning optical microscope (Aurora, TM) images the optical near field\naround the holes. The samples are illuminated from the substrate by a 532 nm laser beam\n(see Fig. 1e). The light intensity on the top surface is measured using Al-coated fiber\n\n2\n\n\fprobes with 50 to 80 nm apertures operating in collection mode at ~5 nm above the\nsample.\nFig. 1a shows the near-field optical pattern around a 200 nm hole in a normally\nilluminated Au film. The maximum intensity is over the hole. Lobes of enhanced\nintensity extend from either hole side over several \u03bcm along the direction of the incident\npolarization. The lobes have pronounced interference fringes with period ~475 nm,\nsignificantly shorter than the incident wavelength. The rotation of the polarization turns\nthe lobes by the same angle (Fig.1b). Similar lobe patterns and polarization dependence,\nalthough without interference fringes, have been observed when SPP's are launched\nusing local illumination through a NSOM tip [5].\nThe fringe period in Fig. 1 coincides with the SPP wavelength on top of a flat gold film,\nlSPP a li\n\nRe(em ) + 1\n= 471 nm for incident light li = 532 nm and Au dielectric constant\nRe(em )\n\nem = -4.67 + i 2.42 [6]. Such a coincidence is at first not clear. For example, interference\n\n\u2020between SPP's launched from arrays of holes results in intensity modulations with period\nlSPP/2 [7]. The single pass attenuation through the thickness h = 100 nm of gold results\nin direct transmission of exp[-2!Im(em1/2)h/li] ~ 7% of the incident amplitude. Here, we\nshow that the interference of this transmitted wave with SPP's on the surface accounts for\nthe lSPP-fringing. Let the film be in the x-y plane between z = -h and 0, with the hole\ncentered at x = y = 0. Assume x-polarized light propagating up from z = - \u2022. Along x\nand near z = 0 we expect Ex a A exp(-|x|/2d) exp(ikSPPx) / |x|1/2 + B, Ey \u2248 0, and Ez a C\nexp(-|x|/2d) exp(ikSPPx) / |x|1/2, omitting the common exp(-iwit) terms. B in the 2nd part\nof Ex is the directly transmitted amplitude. It is easy to see that |Ex|2, the total intensity\n\n3\n\n\f|E|2, and the normal component, Sz, of the time-averaged Poynting vector, S = (1/2) Re(E\nx H*), all contain an oscillatory term proportional to cos(kSPPx), i.e. display interference\nfringes with period lSPP = 2!/kSPP. While previously considered theoretically [8], this\nmechanism was not detected in earlier NSOM studies of individual nanoholes [9, 10]. If\np polarized light is incident at angle a to the film normal (Fig. 1c), the 2nd term in Ex is B\nexp(ikix sina) and the oscillatory term in the intensity becomes cos[(kSPP - ki sina)x]. In\nthe +x direction the fringe period is 2!/(kSPP- klsina), which is larger than it is in the\nopposite (-x) side, 2!/(kSPP+ klsina). We see such changes upon tilting the laser beam, as\nshown in Fig. 1c. The fringes have periods of 405 and 600 nm, respectively, in good\nagreement with the experimental tilt angle a \u2248 130. This asymmetry is even observed for\ns polarization, Fig. 1d.\nFig. 2 shows experimental traces along the lines in Fig. 1a and 1c, plotted as (I-I0)|x|1/2,\nand fits according to the simple model above. I0 is a constant off-set measured at large\ndistance from the hole. Except in the hole vicinity, where additional light intensity due to\nwaves passing directly though the hole arises, the data are described well. In addition to\nthe determination of the fringe periods for normal (Fig. 2a) and inclined (Fig. 2b)\nincidence, an intensity decay length of d \u2248 1.0 \u03bcm is found. The nature of the NSOM\nsignal is less obvious because both |Ex|2 and |E|2, within the simple model above, have\nthe same parametric form and cannot be distinguished with our fits. The FDTD\nsimulations will address this issue.\n2D-light patterns on the film surface are obtained from FDTD simulations [4,11] with a\n100 nm Au layer and total system sizes up to 7.5 x 7.5 x 1 \u03bcm3, with 4 nm grid\nresolution. Owing to the large system size, a parallel FDTD implementation is used.\n\n4\n\n\fFields near grid boundaries are absorbed with a uniaxial perfect matching layer (UPML)\n[4]. A Drude model fit to the refractive index data of Au in the 530-nm region is\nemployed for the film and implemented as in Ref. [12]. Fourier transforms of the results\nyield the electric and magnetic fields. Fig. 1f displays an image map of Sz, evaluated at\n~ 6 nm above the surface. It is in qualitative agreement with the data in Fig. 1a,\nincluding fringes separated by lSPP.\n\nWe also find (not shown here) that |Ex|2 is\n\nqualitatively similar to Sz, whereas |E|2 shows some structures in addition to the lSPPfringes. Also, calculations for a film with no hole allow us to infer directly transmitted\nfields and, upon subtraction from our full film/hole fields we find a pattern without\nfringes, further verifying the role of interference.\nFig. 3 shows (thin line) a horizontal cut (y = 0) of the FDTD result of Fig. 1f. While it\nqualitatively agrees with the corresponding experimental trace (thick curve), note\nnegative energy flow near the nanohole edge. This is consistent with energy losses due to\nSPP creation at hole edges, which is, however, not seen experimentally. To understand\nthe NSOM probe effect [13], we introduce a cone-shaped fiber tip with Al coating above\nthe film (inset, Fig. 3). The tip aperture diameter is 80 nm, and opens up to a cylinder of\ndiameter 240 nm. The total height of the tip structure is 0.6 mm and it is truncated by the\nUPML. A large model tip is necessary in order for it to support propagating modes. Fig.\n3 shows the surface integral of the Poynting vector over the cylinder top (symbols),\nwhich is a measure of the NSOM signal. Note that negative energy flow near the hole\nedges has now disappeared. Fig. 3 shows that the tip calculations preserve the structure\nof the calculations without tip and agree reasonably well with experiment. The\nexperimental curve is shifted by 0.1 \u03bcm to the left in order to line up the fringes. The\n\n5\n\n\freason for this slight discrepancy between experiment and theory could be related to\nirregularities in the experimental tip such as protrusions or uneven Al-cladding.\nTo conclude, sub-wavelength holes in thin metal films act as a point-like SPP sources at\nnormal or near normal incidence. This source can be manipulated by the conditions of\nillumination. The results are accounted for in FDTD calculations, which also show that\nwhile the presence of the NSOM tip can perturb the EM fields, the overall unperturbed\npatterns are preserved in the estimated power going up the tip. We are currently studying\ndifferent geometrical configurations of such holes that can generate qualitatively new\nlight patterns with potential for future nanophotonics applications.\nThe work at ANL was supported by the US Department of Energy, Basic Energy\nSciences, under contract W-31-109-ENG-38, and at NIU by the State of Illinois under\nHECA and the US Dept. of Education.

All frames are 7.5 \u03bcm x 7.5 \u03bcm.\n\nFig. 2 Experimental traces (solid) along the lines indicated in Figs. 1a and 1c, and fits\n(dashed) according to the SPP point-source model.\n\nFig. 3 The (y = 0) x-axis trace through Fig. 1f (thin line), FDTD calculations of the tip\neffect (open squares), and experimental trace (thicker solid line). Each square is\nfrom a separate FDTD calculation with the tip located at different points on the xaxis. The experimental trace was shifted by 0.1 mm to the left in order to align the\nfringes (see text).\n\n9\n\n\fFig. 1\n\nL. Yin et al\n\n10\n\n\fFig. 2\n\nL. Yin et al.\n\n11\n\n\fFig. 3\n\nL.
