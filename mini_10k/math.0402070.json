Therefore, the \"stagnation points\" on the\nmembrane are exactly zeros of the eigenfunction w. This zero set, \u039e(w) := {x \u2208 \u03a3 : w(x) =\nSchool of Mathematics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta\nrako@math.gatech.edu, research partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0134408\n\u2217\n\n1\n\nGA,\n\n30332;\n\ne-mail:\n\n\f0}, is called a nodal set and forms interesting patterns, as originally studied by E. Chladni in\nthe 18th century. In case when the membrane is a closed surface we refer to the problem (1)\nas the free membrane problem, for surfaces with boundary and Dirichlet boundary conditions\nwe refer to the problem as the fixed membrane problem (see [7].) For an arbitrary smooth\nRiemannian surface (\u03a3, g\u03a3 ), the structure of nodal sets has been characterized by S. Cheng\nin [7], where it is proved that the nodal set is a collection of C 2 - immersed closed curves in\n\u03a3. For a generic metric, K. Uhlenbeck [27] showed that these curves are embedded circles\nwith no critical points. Not much is known about the general structure of such sets. One\nof the fundamental results is Courant's nodal domain theorem. It states that the nodal set\nof the kth eigenfunction of the Laplacian divides a domain into at most k regions in case\nof the fixed membrane problem, and k + 1 regions in case of the free membrane problem.\nCourant's theorem implies that the first (second) eigenfunction of \u2206\u03a3 has to divide the\nregion into exactly two domains for the free (fixed) membrane problem. In [22], L. E. Payne\nconjectured that in case of the fixed membrane problem for bounded domains in R2 , the\nsecond eigenfunction of Laplacian cannot posses a closed nodal line.\nConjecture 1.1 (Payne(1967)). The second eigenfunction of the Laplacian on a bounded\nregion \u03a9 in Euclidean R2 with the Dirichlet boundary conditions cannot have a closed loop\nin its nodal set.\nSince 1967, Payne's conjecture has been proved to be true in the case of convex domains\n(see [2] and [21]). Recently, it has been proved false by T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof and co-authors\n(see [15]), in the case of a non-simply connected domain (disk with slits on an inner circle\nremoved). It is still not known, however, if Conjecture 1.1 is true for an arbitrary simply\nconnected region in R2 . In [12], P. Freitas has shown that Conjecture fails in case of \u03a9 = D 2\nfor a non-Euclidean metric.\nWe consider a more global version of Payne's conjecture:\nProblem 1.2. Does the first \u2206\u03a3 - eigenfunction on a given closed surface \u03a3 admit a contractible nodal curve in \u03a3?\nThe principal result of the paper is the construction of examples which answer this\nquestion in the affirmative.\nWe observe that Problem 1.2 is closely related to ideas coming from the topology of\ncontact structures: in dimension three, these are fields of 2-d planes which are maximally\nnonintegrable - they are as far away from defining a foliation as possible. The topology of\ncontact structures is extremely interesting and has been the focus of much research among\ntopologists. In particular, much progress has been made through the elucidation of a dichotomy between the tight and overtwisted contact structures (see Section 2 for definitions).\nOur principal observation is a connection between certain topological features of a contact\nstructure - so-called dividing curves associated to a convex surface \u03a3 - and the nodal sets\nfor eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on \u03a3. These results yield a reformulation of Problem 1.2:\nProblem 1.3. Given (\u03a3, g), is the contact structure on \u03a3 \u00d7 R induced by the first eigenfunction of \u2206\u03a3 overtwisted?\n2\n\n\fThese two conjectures are cousins and provide some basis for a spectral geometry interpretation of the tight-overtwisted dichotomy in contact topology.\n\n1.2\n\nOutline and terminology.\n\nIn Section 2, we give a short overview of contact topology and introduce the relevant definitions. The next section is devoted to the relationship between nodal sets and dividing curves\nin contact geometry. Section 3 carefully constructs counterexamples to Payne's conjecture\non closed Riemannian surfaces. Specifically, we prove that an arbitrary orientable surface\nadmits metrics such that the principal eigenfunction has nodal set a single closed contractible\ncurve. Our technique is based on the work of J. Takahashi, [26], about collapsing connected\nsums of surfaces, which is in turn based on work of C. Anne (see [4]). As an additional result,\nwe show the C \u221e - convergence of eigenfunctions on compact subsets of the \"non-collapsing\"\npart of the manifold.\nHere, all manifolds, unless stated otherwise, are equipped with a Riemannian metric,\nand are compact smooth orientable of dimension either two or three. Throughout the article\nC j (M) stands for the set of j- differentiable functions on M, with j = \u221e smooth, and\nj = \u03c9 analytic. Spaces L2 (M), H j (M) are customary, square integrable real functions,\nand the Sobolev space of real valued functions with at least j bounded weak derivatives.\nThe space \u03a9k (M)L\n= C \u221e (\u039bk M) is a set of smooth real valued k- differential forms on M\nmaking \u03a9\u2217 (M) = nk=0 \u03a9k (M) a graded C \u221e (M) module over R, where n = dim(M). Here\nwe denote by L2 (\u039bk M) and H j (\u039bk M), respectively, the square integrable, and the Sobolev\nspaces of k- differential forms, where the measure is induced from the Riemannian metric.\nThe Riemannian metric also induces an L2 - isometry: \u2217 : \u03a9k (M) \u2192 \u03a9n\u2212k (M), namely\nthe Hodge star operator. Consequently, we obtain de'Rham graded complexes (\u03a9\u2217 (M), d)\nand (\u03a9\u2217 (M), \u03b4), where d \u2261 dk : \u03a9k (M) \u2192 \u03a9k+1 (M) is an exterior derivative (also called a\ndifferential ), and \u03b4 \u2261 \u03b4 k : \u03a9k+1 (M) \u2192 \u03a9k (M) an adjoint of d (also called a co-differential )\ngiven in terms of the Hodge star by \u03b4 k = (\u22121)k+1 \u2217dn\u2212k\u22121 \u2217 or equivalently as a formal adjoint\nof d,\n(dk \u03c9, \u03b7)L2(\u039bk+1 M ) = (\u03c9, \u03b4 k \u03b7)L2 (\u039bk M ) ,\n\n\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9k (M), \u03b7 \u2208 \u03a9k+1 (M).\n\nMost of the time we skip the superscripts in the notation for differentials and co-differentials\nand simply write d and \u03b4. The Laplacian on k- forms is defined by \u2206 = \u03b4 d + d \u03b4, which in\nthe case of functions reduces to \u2206 = \u03b4 d (for further reference consult [25] or [5]).\nWe also introduce the following notation for nodal sets. Let \u039e(M, f ) = {x \u2208 M : f (x) =\n0} stand for the zero set of the function f . In the case f = fk , where fk is kth- eigenfunction\nof \u2206M , we write \u039e(M, k) := \u039e(M, fk ), or \u039e(M) := \u039e(M, 1) := \u039e(M, f1 ) for k = 1.\n\n2\n\nContact structures and their dividing curves.\n\nLet M be a three dimensional, closed oriented manifold. A smooth plane field \u03be on M\nis called a contact structure if \u03be is maximally nonintegrable; that is, for any pair of vector\n3\n\n\ffields X and Y satisfying Xp , Yp \u2208 \u03bep \u2282 Tp M locally, we have [X, Y ]p \u2208\n/ \u03bep . (This condition is\nexactly opposite to the Frobenius condition for integrable subbundles.) The plane field \u03be can\nalways be defined as the kernel of differential 1-form \u03b1 on M. The 1-form \u03b1 is determined\nup to a multiplication by a positive real valued function and is called a contact form. In\nterms of \u03b1 the condition of non-integrability can be expressed as follows,\n\u03b1 \u2227 d\u03b1 6= 0.\n\n(2)\n\nIt was proved some time ago by R. Lutz and J. Martinet (in [20]) that every closed 3manifold admits a contact structure. Since then, there has been a significant amount of\nresearch devoted to the problem of classifying contact structures up to an isotopy of plane\nfields (see e.g. [11], [16], [17]). One of the fundamental results in this direction is a theorem\nof Y. Eliashberg [9] which divides contact structures into two classes: overtwisted and tight.\nDefinition 2.1. A contact structure \u03be is overtwisted if and only if there exists an embedded\ndisk D 2 \u2282 M such that D is transverse to \u03be near \u2202D but \u2202D is tangent to \u03be. Any contact\nstructure which is not overtwisted is called tight.\nIn [9], Y. Eliashberg classified overtwisted contact structures in terms of the homotopy\ntype of plane fields. On the other hand, the complete classification of tight structures still\nremains an open problem. In the study of this problem the concept of dividing curves for\nconvex surfaces plays a major role [18], [16], [17].\nDefinition 2.2. A convex surface is a properly embedded surface \u03a3 in (M, \u03be) such that there\nexists a vector field v \u22d4 \u03a3 transverse to \u03a3 and preserving \u03be (i.e. Lv \u03be = 0). The vector field v\nis called a contact vector field. The dividing set, \u0393\u03a3 , is the set of all points p on the surface\n\u03a3 where vp \u2208 \u03bep .\nThe following theorem by Giroux (in [14]) characterizes the dividing set \u0393\u03a3 .\nTheorem 2.3. Let \u03a3 be a convex surface in (M, \u03be). The dividing set \u0393\u03a3 of \u03be is a set of\nsmooth curves. Moreover, the isotopy type of \u0393\u03a3 is independent of choice of the contact field\nv.\nA parallel theorem (also in [14]) gives a local classification result for contact structures\nin a tubular neighborhood of a convex surface.\nTheorem 2.4. If \u03a3 6= S 2 is a convex surface for \u03be, then \u03a3 has a tight neighborhood in\nM if and only if no component of \u0393\u03a3 is contractible in \u03a3. If \u03a3 = S 2 , then \u03a3 has a tight\nneighborhood if and only if \u0393\u03a3 has only one component.\nOur objective is to show that, for a special choice of a Riemannian metric, in a tubular\nneighborhood of \u03a3 the dividing set \u0393\u03a3 becomes the set of nodal lines for a \u2206\u03a3 - eigenfunction\non \u03a3. In the next section we discuss a metric adaptation to contact structures.\n\n4\n\n\f2.1\n\nAdapted metrics for contact structures.\n\nDefinition 2.5. A given metric g is a contact metric for a contact form \u03b1 if it satisfies\nd\u03b1 = \u2217\u03bb \u03b1,\n\ng(\u03b1, \u03b1) 6= 0,\n\n\u03bb \u2208 C \u221e (M), \u03bb(x) 6= 0\n\nfor all x \u2208 M.\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u2217 is the Hodge star operator induced by g.\nIn [8], the authors prove that any contact form \u03b1 admits such a metric (the definitions\nused there are slightly stronger).\nLemma 2.6. Any 1-form \u03b1 satisfying condition (3) for some contact metric g is a contact\nform.\nProof. One checks the contact condition (2). We have\n\u03b1 \u2227 d\u03b1 = \u03b1 \u2227 (\u03bb \u2217 \u03b1) = \u03bbg(\u03b1, \u03b1)\u03bc,\n\n\u03bc = \u22171.\n\nBy assumptions in (3) we obtain \u03b1 \u2227 d\u03b1 6= 0.\nEvery contact metric is, in fact, fully determined by a choice of an adapted (co)frame,\nand can expressed in terms of a contact form \u03b1 and its differential d\u03b1 [19].\n\n2.2\n\nNodal lines and dividing curves of contact structures.\n\nRecall from the introduction that the dividing set \u0393\u03a3 of a convex surface \u03a3 embedded\nin (M, \u03be) is the set of all points p where the contact field vp belongs to contact planes \u03bep .\nLemma 2.7. Let \u03a3 denote a closed surface and let \u03b1 be a contact form on \u03a3 \u00d7 (\u22121, 1)\nsuch that each \u03a3 \u00d7 {t} is convex with a contact field v preserving \u03b1, i.e., Lv \u03b1 = 0. Assume\nfurthermore that g is a contact metric satisfying\n(i) \u03bb = const,\n(ii) for each t \u2208 (\u22121, 1), v is orthonormal to \u03a3 \u00d7 {t} with respect to g.\nThen the dividing set \u0393\u03a3 of \u03b1 is precisely the nodal set of the (\u2212\u03bb2 )-eigenfunction of \u2206\u03a3 on\n(\u03a3, g\u03a3 ), where g\u03a3 is the induced metric on \u03a3.\nProof. By assumption, we can choose a coframe {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 }, such that \u03b81 = g(v, *), and\n{\u03b82 , \u03b83 } \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3) is an orthonormal coframe on \u03a3. Denote by {X1 , X2 , X3 } a dual frame\n(v = X1 .) We can express \u03b1 in the coframe as follows,\n\u03b1 = f \u03b81 + \u03b2,\n\nwhere \u03b2 = \u03c62 \u03b82 + \u03c63 \u03b83 .\n\nNotice that,\n\u0393\u03a3 = {p \u2208 \u03a3 \u00d7 {0}; vp \u2208 \u03bep } = {p \u2208 \u03a3 \u00d7 {0}; vp y \u03b1p = f (p) = 0} = f \u22121 (0) \u2229 \u03a3 \u00d7 {0}.\n5\n\n\fNow, we show that \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3). Notice that the requirement Lv \u03b1 = 0 together with (3)\nimplies\n0 = Lv \u03b1 = v y d\u03b1 + d f = v y \u2217 \u03bb \u03b1 + d f\n= \u03bb v y (f \u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83 \u2212 \u03c62 \u03b81 \u2227 \u03b83 + \u03c63 \u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 ) + d f\n= \u03bb v y (\u03b81 \u2227 \u2217\u03a3 \u03b2) + d f,\nwhere \u2217\u03a3 is the Hodge star operator on (\u03a3, g\u03a3 ). It follows that,\nd f = \u2212\u03bb \u2217\u03a3 \u03b2.\nSince df =\n\nP\n\ni (Xi f ) \u03b8i ,\n\n(4)\n\nwe obtain the following equations for f , \u03c62 , \u03c63 .\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2X2 f = \u2212\u03bb \u03c63\nX3 f = \u03bb \u03c6 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nX1 f = 0.\n\n(5)\n\nChoosing local coordinates (t, x, y), so that v = \u2202t and (\u2202x , \u2202y ) are tangent to the surface\n\u03a3, we conclude that functions f, \u03c62 , \u03c63 depend just on (x, y) and \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3). It follows that\nd\u03b2 = d\u03a3 \u03b2 and d \u03b81 = d d t = 0. As a consequence of this and (4), we obtain \u2217\u03b7 = \u03b81 \u2227 (\u2217\u03a3 \u03b7),\nand\n\u2217d(f \u03b81 ) = \u2217(df \u2227 \u03b81 ) = \u03bb \u2217 (\u03b81 \u2227 \u2217\u03a3 \u03b2) = \u03bb \u2217 \u2217\u03b2 = \u03bb\u03b2.\nExpressing condition (3) in terms of \u03b1 = f \u03b81 + \u03b2, we have\n\u03bb \u03b1 = \u03bb f \u03b81 + \u03bb \u03b2 = \u2217d\u03b1 = \u2217d(f \u03b81 ) + \u2217d\u03b2 = \u03bb\u03b2 + \u2217d\u03b2;\n\u21d2 \u2217d\u03b2 = \u03bb f \u03b81 .\nIt follows that\n\u2217\u03a3 d\u03b2 = \u03bb f.\n\n(6)\n\nEquations (4) and (6) imply that \u2206\u03a3 f = \u2212\u03bb2 f , where \u2206\u03a3 = \u2212 \u2217\u03a3 d \u2217\u03a3 d. Therefore \u0393\u03a3 is\nthe nodal set for f .\nObserve that in the frame {\u03b8i }i , the adapted metric g is given by\ng=\n\nX\n\n\u03b8i2\n\n2\n\n= dt + g\u03a3 ,\n\ni.e. in coordinates (t, x, y),\n\ni\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 0\n,\ng=\n0 g\u03a3\n\n(7)\n\nwhere g\u03a3 = \u03b822 + \u03b832 is an induced metric on \u03a3. Hence g = 1 \u2295 g\u03a3 is a product metric on\nU = \u03a3 \u00d7 (\u22121, 1). (One can prove the above lemma directly from the decomposition of the\nLaplacian on U in the product metric.)\n6\n\n\fRemark 2.8. If we restrict the coframe {\u03b8i } to \u03a3 \u0592\u2192 \u03a3 \u00d7 {0} \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 (\u22121, 1), the calculation\nin the above proof is still valid. Thus the result holds if we assume that \u03b81 = g(v, *) is a part\nof the orthonormal coframe, and d \u03b81 |\u03a3\u00d7{0} = 0. In other words, the metric g can be only\n\"infinitesimally\" given as in (7).\nFor an arbitrary \u2206\u03a3 -eigenfunction f on (\u03a3, h\u03a3 ), where h\u03a3 is a smooth metric, the set\nof equations (5) determines a 1-form \u03b1 in a thickening of the surface \u03a3. If the nodal set\nof f does not contain singular points, then \u03b1(x) 6= 0 for all x and \u03b1 satisfies (3) in the\nproduct metric g = 1 \u2295 h\u03a3 (see [19] for the explicit calculation). Consequently, we obtain\nthe following.\nTheorem 2.9. If \u039e(\u03a3, k) is the set of nonsingular nodal lines for a k-th eigenfunction f of\nthe Laplace operator \u2206\u03a3 on (\u03a3, h\u03a3 ). Then there exists a contact form \u03b1 in the thickening\n\u03a3 \u00d7 (\u22121, 1) of \u03a3 such that\n(i) \u03a3 is a convex surface for a contact structure \u03be\u03b1 = ker(\u03b1),\n(ii) \u039e(\u03a3, k) is the dividing set of \u03be\u03b1 .\n(iii) \u03b1 is an \u03bb- eigenform of the curl operator \u2217 d, where \u2212\u03bb2 is the \u2206\u03a3 - eigenvalue of f .\nWe say further that \u03b1 is induced by f in the thickening of \u03a3.\n\n2.3\n\nThe topological version of Payne's conjecture.\n\nBased on results of the previous section we state the topological version of Payne's conjecture\nas the following question.\nProblem 2.10. Is the contact structure \"induced\" by the first \u2206\u03a3 -eigenfunctions in the\nsense of Theorem 2.9, always tight in the thickening of the convex surface \u03a3?\nIn light of Giroux's Theorem 2.4 the answer is positive if \u03a3 \u2243 S 2 . This is a consequence\nof Courant's theorem, which implies that there are exactly two nodal domains for the first\n\u2206S 2 -eigenfunction on S 2 and that the nodal set has to be a single embedded circle. Thus\n#\u0393\u03a3 = #\u039e(S 2 ) = 1 and the associated contact structure has to be tight. In case \u03a3 is an\norientable surface of genus \u2265 1, Problem 2.10 is equivalent to Question 1.2 posed in the\nintroduction. In order to give a negative answer to 2.10 it suffices to construct a metric on\n\u03a3 such that the first \u2206\u03a3 - eigenfunction has a closed nodal line bounding a disc. We devote\nthe remaining part of this paper to a rigorous construction of such metrics for orientable\nsurfaces of an arbitrary genus. In [19] we use this result, together with Theorem 2.9, to\nshow existence of overtwisted principal Beltrami field (i.e. an eigenfield of the curl operator)\nwhich originally has been conjectured to be false in [10].\n\n7\n\n\f\u039e(M1)\n\n\u03b5\n\nx0\n\nM2(\u03b5)\n\nDx0(\u03b5)\n\n\u039e(M\u03b5)\n\nM1(\u03b5)\nFigure 1: For small \u03b5, nodal lines \u039e(M\u03b5 ) and \u039e(M1 ) have to be \"close\" in M\u03b5 = (M1 (\u03b5) \u222a\u03a6\u03b5\nM2 (\u03b5), g\u03b5).\n\n3\n\nClosed nodal lines for the free membrane problem.\n\nRecall from the introduction that Laplace-Beltrami operator \u2206M = \u03b4 d is a positive\nformally self-adjoint operator on any closed orientable Riemannian manifold (M, g). By the\nstandard spectral theory of formally self-adjoint operators, the L2 - spectrum of \u2206M is real\nand countable,\n0 = \u03bb0 (M) < \u03bb1 (M) \u2264 \u03bb2 (M) \u2264 * * * \u2264 \u03bbk (M) \u2264 * * * \u2192 \u221e,\nand one can choose an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors {fi }i\u2208N\u222a{0} in L2 (M) (which are\nsmooth by regularity),\n\u2206M fk = \u03bbk (M)fk ,\n\nkfk kL2 (M ) = 1,\n\nfk \u2208 C \u221e (M).\n\nThe main objective of this section is to prove\nTheorem 3.1. For an arbitrary closed compact orientable surface \u03a3, there always exists a\nsmooth metric g\u03a3 such that \u039e(\u03a3) is a single embedded circle which bounds a disc in \u03a3.\nAs already argued in the previous section, this statement is a straightforward corollary\nin the case of \u03a3 = S 2 . Namely, it is enough to choose a generic metric and refer to the result\n8\n\n\fof K. Uhlenbeck ([27]) which states that \u039e(S 2 ) has to be a one dimensional submanifold.\nBy Courant's Theorem \u039e(S 2 ) splits S 2 into two open domains, thereby implying that \u039e(S 2 )\nmust be a single embedded circle. If the surface is of genus \u2265 1, we produce a desired\nmetric by gluing via boundary circles a \"big\" sphere M1 \u2243 S 2 with an \u03b5- disc removed,\nM1 (\u03b5) \u2243 S 2 \\ Int(D 2 ) \u2243 D 2 , to an \u03b5-\"small\" surface M2 (\u03b5), homeomorphic to \u03a3 \\ Int(D 2 ).\nThe resulting manifold M\u03b5 is homeomorphic to \u03a3, and as \u03b5 \u2192 0 we show that the nodal set\n\u039e(M\u03b5 ) converges to \u039e(M1 ). (See Figure 1.) Thus for sufficiently small \u03b5 = \u03b5\u0302, \u039e(M\u03b5\u0302 ) has to\nbe a closed embedded circle that belongs to M1 (\u03b5\u0302) \u2243 D 2 .\n\n3.1\n\nDefinition of M\u03b5 .\n\nFirst, observe the following elementary construction. If we choose an embedded contractible 2-disc D 2 in an orientable surface \u03a3 and define \u03a3\u2032 \u223c\n= \u03a3 \\ Int(D 2 ), then, for an\narbitrary diffeomorphism \u03a6 : \u2202D 2 \u2192 \u2202\u03a3\u2032 , we can always form a topological manifold\n\u03a3\u03a6 = D 2 \u222a\u03a6 \u03a3\u2032 by gluing D 2 back to \u03a3\u2032 via \u03a6 (see e.g. [13]). Since \u03a3\u03a6 is homeomorphic to \u03a3, we can make \u03a3\u03a6 into a smooth manifold by pulling back the differential structure\nfrom \u03a3. All \u03a3\u03a6 obtained this way are diffeomorphic. If we equip D 2 and \u03a3\u2032 with smooth\nRiemannian metrics g1\u2032 and g2\u2032 we can define a piecewise smooth metric g on \u03a3\u03a6 as follows\n(\ng1\u2032 on D 2 ,\ng=\ng2\u2032 on \u03a3\u2032 .\nNow g is continuous on \u03a3\u03a6 if the gluing map \u03a6 is an isometry. In case \u03a6 admits an extension\nto the smooth isometry of tubular neighborhoods of boundaries \u2202D 2 , \u2202\u03a3\u2032 , the metric g is\nsmooth as well.\nConsider an arbitrary smooth metric on S 2 which is flat around x0 . By adding a small\nperturbation with support away from x0 , we can produce a generic metric g1 on S 2 flat in\na small neighborhood Ux0 of the point x0 , and such that all the eigenvalues {\u03bbk (M1 )}k are\nsimple in g1 . (Consult [27] p. 1074 for a precise definition of a metric perturbation and a\nrigorous proof of this fact in Theorem 8, p. 1076.) Let M1 = (S 2 , g1) be a 2-sphere obtained\nvia this process. Additionally, We assume that x0 \u2208\n/ \u039e(M1 ); otherwise we choose a different\npoint in the flat neighborhood. Let Dx20 (\u03b5) \u2282 Ux0 be a geodesic disc around x0 of radius\n\u03b5 which is smaller than a geodesic distance between x0 and \u039e(M1 ), then for any \u03b5 > 0,\nM1 (\u03b5) = (M1 \\ Int(Dx20 ( 2\u03b5 )), g1) is diffeomorphic to D 2 . In order to obtain a metric on \u03a3\u2032 ,\nwe do not make any extra assumptions, we simply choose an arbitrary smooth metric g2 on\n\u03a3, flat around a given point x1 , and a geodesic disc Dx21 (r) of radius r which belongs to the\nflat neighborhood. Clearly, \u03a3 \\ Dx21 (r) is diffeomorphic to \u03a3\u2032 and since the metric g2 can be\n2\nalways rescaled, we may assume that r = 1. Define M2 (\u03b5) = (\u03a3\u2032 , \u03b54 g2 ).\nFor any \u03b5 > 0, choose local coordinates (x, y) such that the geodesic disc Dx20 (\u03b5) is\nan \u03b5 disc on (R2 , d2 s) and Dx21 (\u03b5) is a unit disc on (R2 , \u03b52 d2 s), where ds2 = dx2 + dy 2.\nObserve that the boundaries \u2202M2 (\u03b5), \u2202M2 (\u03b5) can be glued via an isometry \u03a6\u03b5 of (R2 , d2 s)\n2\nand (R2 , \u03b54 d2 s) restricted to a circle of radius \u03b5 in (R2 , d2 s). (The isometry \u03a6\u03b5 can be defined\n9\n\n\fas \u03a6\u03b5 : x \u2192 2\u03b5 x.) By the discussion in the first paragraph of this section we can form a\nsmooth manifold M = M1 (\u03b5) \u222a\u03a6\u03b5 M2 (\u03b5) and define a piecewise smooth continuous metric on\nM as follows (see also [26].)\n(\ng1\non D 2 ,\n(8)\nge\u03b5 = gM1 (\u03b5)\u222a\u03a6\u03b5 M2 (\u03b5) = \u03b52\ng on \u03a3\u2032 .\n4 2\nAccording to [26] the following convergence of eigenvalues holds,\nTheorem 3.2. For all k = 0, 1, . . . , we have\nlim \u03bbk (M, ge\u03b5 ) = \u03bbk (M1 , g1 ).\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\n(9)\n\nRemark 3.3. Our main objective is to prove convergence of nodal lines in M to the nodal line\nof M1 . Since the metric e\ng\u03b5 is not smooth, and we would like to show a smooth counterexample\nto our version of Payne's conjecture, we need to perturb e\ng\u03b5 in a suitable way.\n\nFor piecewise smooth metrics, eigenvalues of the Laplacian \"vary\" continuously with\nrespect to the C 0 -topology (see [6] p. 162.) Therefore, for a given \u03b5 > 0 we can perturb the\nmetric e\ng\u03b5 to a smooth metric g\u03b5 so that eigenvalues are arbitrarily \"close\". (See Theorem\n1.2 in [26].) By Theorem 8 in [27] and results of [6], we may assume that the support of the\nperturbation is contained in the complement M1 (\u03b5)c of M1 (\u03b5) in M. Denote (M, g\u03b5 ) by M\u03b5 .\nConsequently, we can have a family of metrics {g\u03b5 }\u03b5 , satisfying the following requirements.\n(i) g\u03b5 are smooth and converge to ge\u03b5 in the C 0 -topology of M.\n\n(ii) g\u03b5 |M1 (\u03b5) = g1 .\n\n(iii) Eigenvalues \u03bbk (M\u03b5 ) are all simple and nodal lines \u039e(M\u03b5 ) are embedded circles.\n(iv) lim\u03b5\u21920 \u03bbk (M\u03b5 ) = \u03bbk (M1 ).\nWe summarize our notation below,\n\u2022 M = M1 (\u03b5) \u222a\u03a6\u03b5 M2 (\u03b5),\n\u2022 M1 = (S 2 , g1 ), M1 (\u03b5) = (M1 \\ Dx20 ( 2\u03b5 ), g1 ),\n2\n\n\u2022 M2 (\u03b5) = (\u03a3 \\ Dx21 (1), \u03b54 g2 ),\n\u2022 M\u03b5 = (M, g\u03b5 ).\nIf we must specify a different metric on a manifold, we write e.g. (M2 (\u03b5), \u011d).\n\n10\n\n\f3.2\n\nC \u221e -convergence of eigenfunctions.\n\nComparing nodal lines \u039e(M\u03b5 ) and \u039e(M1 ) can be a little bit subtle. Notice that for each\n\u03b5 > 0, M\u03b5 is diffeomorphic to \u03a3 and {g\u03b5 }\u03b5 is a family of metrics on \u03a3. In the limit \u03b5 = 0, the\nmetric g\u03b5 degenerates on M2 (1), and M0 = (\u03a3, g0 ) is not homeomorphic to M1 = (S 2 , g1 ).\nRather, it inherits topology that is pulled back from M1 under the quotient map, \u03c0 : \u03a3 \u2192\n\u03a3/M2 (1) \u2243 S 2 . Thus we really have no control over what happens to the nodal set in the\n\"shrinking\" part M2 (\u03b5) of the manifold M\u03b5 ; technically, we cannot compare eigenfunctions\non M1 to the eigenfunctions fk\u03b5 \u2208 C \u221e (M\u03b5 ) on M\u03b5 . We must instead restrict them to the\ncommon domain M1 (\u03b50 ) for a given \u03b50 > 0. In order to prove the convergence of nodal\nlines as \u03b5 \u2192 0, we must show uniform convergence of eigenfunctions fk\u03b5 restricted to M1 (\u03b50 ).\n\u03b5\nIn this section, we show that for any sequence {\u03b5j }j ; \u03b5j \u2192 0, {fk j |M1 (\u03b50 ) }\u03b5j converges to\nfk |M1 (\u03b50 ) \u2208 C \u221e (M1 (\u03b50 )) in the C \u221e -topology. For this purpose we need suitable extensions of\nfk\u03b5 |M1 (\u03b5) to the entire M1 . In the proof we use the following extension lemma.\nLemma 3.4. Let g we an arbitrary smooth metric on M1 , given u \u2208 H l (M1 (\u03b5), g), there\nexists a function \u016b \u2208 H l (M1 , g), which is an extension of u, i.e. \u016b|M1 (\u03b5) = u such that\nk\u016bkH l (M1 ,g) \u2264 CkukH l (M1 (\u03b5),g) .\n\n(10)\n\nFor l > 1 the constant C depends on l and \u03b5. In the case l = 1 and dim=2, we can find an\nextension \u016b such that C is independent of \u03b5.\nThe proof for l = 1 and dim=2 is given in [23] p. 40, where the authors show that for\nthe unique harmonic extension, the constant C is independent of \u03b5. In case l > 1, the proof\nfollows from the standard extension results for functions in H l (see e.g. [1]); the constant C\nusually, grows like 1/\u03b5l .)\nTheorem 3.5. For each k, and an arbitrary j > 2, the following C j -convergence of eigenfunctions fk\u03b5 \u2208 C \u221e (M\u03b5 ), kfk\u03b5 kL2 (M\u03b5 ) = 1 holds:\nlim fk\u03b5 = fk\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\non compact subsets of M1 \\ {x0 }\n\n(11)\n\nwhere fk \u2208 C \u221e (M1 ) is a kth- \u2206M1 -eigenfunction on M1 .\nThe above theorem leads to an immediate corollary,\nCorollary 3.6. Convergence (11) holds on compact subsets of M1 \\ {x0 } in the C \u221e -topology\nof M1 .\nProof of Theorem 3.5. For a given eigenfunction fk\u03b5 on M\u03b5 , we introduce the following notation; fk\u03b5 = (fk1,\u03b5 , fk2,\u03b5 ), where fk1,\u03b5 = fk\u03b5 |M1 (\u03b5) , fk2,\u03b5 = fk\u03b5 |M2 (\u03b5) . For convenience we also assume\n\u03b5 < 1. First we prove that there is a family of extensions {f\u02c6k1,\u03b5 }\u03b5 , f\u02c6k1,\u03b5 |M1 (\u03b5) = fk1,\u03b5 , convergent\nin L2 (M1 ) to fk . (The argument is essentially the same as in [26] p. 206.)\n\n11\n\n\fChoosing f\u02c6k1,\u03b5 to be the H 1 -extensions of fk1,\u03b5 \u2208 C \u221e (M1 (\u03b5)) given by Lemma 3.4. We\nhave the following,\nkf\u02c6k1,\u03b5 kH 1 (M1 ) \u2264 \u0108kfk1,\u03b5 kH 1 (M (\u03b5),g1 )\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u0108 is independent of \u03b5. From (12) we obtain\n(1)\n\u0001\nkf\u02c6k1,\u03b5 kH 1 (M1 ) \u2264 \u0108kfk\u03b5 kH 1 (M1 (\u03b5),g1 ) \u2264 \u0108 kfk\u03b5 kL2 (M\u03b5 ) + kdfk\u03b5 kL2 (\u039b1 M\u03b5 )\n1\n1\n\u0001 (2)\n= \u0108 1 + (\u2206M\u03b5 fk\u03b5 , fk\u03b5 )L2 2 (M\u03b5 ) = \u0108(1 + \u03bbk2 (M1 ) + \u03b7\u03b5 ),\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b7\u03b5 \u2192 0 as \u03b5 \u2192 0. Inequality (1) follows from the definition of the H 1 -norm, assumption\n(ii) on g\u03b5 and the fact that M1 (\u03b5) \u2282 M\u03b5 ; the equality (2) is a consequence of assumption\n(iv) on g\u03b5 . We conclude that the family {f\u02c6k1,\u03b5 }\u03b5 is bounded in H 1 (M1 ), thus any sequence in\nthe family contains a weakly convergent subsequence in H 1 (M1 ). By Rellich's Theorem, the\ninclusion H 1 (M1 ) \u0592\u2192 L2 (M1 ) is compact, thus any sequence in the family {f\u02c6k1,\u03b5 }\u03b5 contains a\nstrongly convergent subsequence {f\u02c6k1,\u03b5i }\u03b5i in L2 (M1 ). Denote the limit of the subsequence by\nf\u02c6k \u2208 H 1(M1 ). We wish to show that f\u02c6k is a smooth classical solution to \u2206M1 u = \u03bbk (M1 )u.\nLet B : H 1 (M1 ) \u00d7 H 1 (M1 ) \u2192 R be the bilinear form associated to the Laplacian \u2206M1 .\nRecall that for smooth functions u and w,\nB(u, w) = (\u03b4 d u, w)L2(M1 ) = (d u, d w)L2(\u039b1 M1 ) .\nThe last equality extends the definition of B to H 1 (M1 ).

From the density\nof Cc\u221e (M1 \\ {x0 }) in H 1 (M1 , g1), which holds in dimensions \u2265 2, (see [3],) the equality\nB(f\u02c6k , v) = \u03bbk (M1 )(f\u02c6k , v)L2 (M1 ) is valid for any v \u2208 H 1 (M1 ). Consequently, f\u02c6k is a weak\nsolution to \u2206M1 u = \u03bbk (M1 )u, and by the regularity of weak solutions we conclude that f\u02c6k is\na smooth classical solution. Since all the eigenvalues \u03bbk (M1 ) are simple in g1 and\n1 = kfk kL2 (M1 ,g1 ) = lim kfk kL2 (M1 (\u03b5i ),g1 ) = lim kf\u02c6k1,\u03b5i kL2 (M1 (\u03b5i ),g1 ) = kf\u02c6k kL2 (M1 ,g1 )\ni\u2192\u221e\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\n12\n\n\fwe conclude that f\u02c6k = fk .\nIn the next step, we argue C j -convergence of fk1,\u03b5i on compact subsets of M1 \\ {x0 }.\nChoose \u03b50 such that M1 (\u03b50 ) contains a given compact subset and let l > j + m2 + 1 =\nj + 2, where m = 2 is the dimension of M1 , (we assume j > 2 for convenience). Letting\n\u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 , we apply Lemma 3.4 and consider a family of H l -extensions f \u0304k1,\u03b5 \u2208 H l (M1 ) for\nfk1,\u03b5 \u2208 C \u221e (M1 (\u03b50 )).

In (3) we can set Kl\u22122 > Dl,l\u22121 max{2, (1 +\n\u03bbk (M\u03b5 )Cl\u22122,\u03b50 )} due to the requirement (iv) on g\u03b5 . Repeating the above steps finitely many\ntimes leads to\n\u0001\nkf \u0304k1,\u03b5 kH l (M1 ) \u2264 K1 kf \u0304k1,\u03b5 kH 1 (M1 ) \u2264 K1 C1 kfk1,\u03b5 kL2 (M1 (\u03b50 ),g1 ) + kdfk1,\u03b5 kL2 (\u039b1 M1 (\u03b50 ),g1 )\n1\n1\n\u0001\n\u2264 K1 C1 1 + (\u2206M\u03b5 fk\u03b5 , fk\u03b5 )L2 2 (M\u03b5 ) \u2264 K1 C1 (1 + \u03bbk2 (M1 ) + \u03b7\u03b5\u2032 ),\n\nwhere \u03b7\u03b5\u2032 \u2192 0 as \u03b5 \u2192 0 and we applied Lemma 3.4 in the second inequality. Consequently,\nthe family {f \u0304k1,\u03b5 }\u03b5 is bounded in H l (M1 ). By Rellich's Theorem we have a compact inclusion\nH l (M1 ) \u0592\u2192 H l\u22121(M1 ), and by Sobolev embedding theorem a bounded inclusion H l\u22121 (M1 ) \u0592\u2192\nC j (M1 ). Composition of these two gives us a compact inclusion H l (M1 ) \u0592\u2192 C j (M1 ). As a\nresult, there exists a subsequence {f \u0304k1,\u03b5i }i of any sequence in {f \u0304k1,\u03b5 }\u03b5 , convergent in the C j\ntopology of M1 . Denote a limit of this subsequence by f \u0304k \u2208 C j (M1 ).\nSince f\u02c6k1,\u03b5 |M1 (\u03b50 ) = fk1,\u03b5 |M1 (\u03b50 ) = f \u0304k1,\u03b5 |M1 (\u03b50 ) for any \u03b5 < \u03b50 , the L2 -limits f\u02c6k , f \u0304k have to agree\non M1 (\u03b50 ). Equality (11) holds, since for any sequence {\u03b5i }i converging to zero {fk1,\u03b5i |M1 (\u03b50 ) }\ncontains a convergent subsequence with a common limit.\n13\n\n\f3.3\n\nProof of Theorem 3.1.\n\nWe assume that the nodal line \u039e(M1 ) is at a geodesic distance d > \u03b50 from the gluing disc\nD\u03b5 \u2282 D\u03b50 . The nodal sets \u039e(M1 ) and \u039e(M\u03b5 ) can be compared only on the common subset\nM1 (\u03b50 ), and since we just proved the convergence in C \u221e (M1 (\u03b50 )) of f1\u03b5i |M1 (\u03b50 ) \u2192 f1 |M1 (\u03b50 ) for\nany sequence \u03b5i \u2192 0, the first impression is that we have no control over nodal lines in the\n\"shrinking\" part M2 (\u03b5) of the manifold M\u03b5 . What we really have to show is that for some\n\u03b5 > 0 the nodal set \u039e(M\u03b5 ) belongs entirely to the common domain M1 (\u03b50 ). This would imply\nthat \u039e(M\u03b5 ) is an embedded contractible circle, since M1 (\u03b50 ) is itself contractible. First of all\nnote the following pointwise convergence of nodal sets.\nLemma 3.7. Consider a sequence of points {xi }i such that for each i, xi \u2208 \u039e(M\u03b5i ) \u2229 M1 (\u03b50 ).\nIf the limit x of {xi }i exists, then x \u2208 \u039e(M1 ).\nProof. Applying the convergence f1\u03b5i |M1 (\u03b50 ) \u2192 f1 |M1 (\u03b50 ) in C 0 (M1 (\u03b50 )) we obtain,\ni\u2192\u221e\n\n|f1 (xi )| = |f1 (xi ) \u2212 f11,\u03b5i (xi )| \u2264 kf1 \u2212 f11,\u03b5i kC 0 (M1 (\u03b50 )) \u2212\u2192 0.\nBy continuity of f1 and the assumption xi \u2192 x \u2208 M1 (\u03b50 ), we have 0 = limi\u2192\u221e f1 (xi ) = f1 (x),\nand we conclude that x \u2208 \u039e(M1 ).\nIn order to finish the proof of Theorem 3.1 we need only show the following.\nClaim 3.8. The nodal lines \u039e(M\u03b5i ) are eventually in M1 (\u03b50 ), i.e. we can find an index n\nsuch that for all i > n, \u039e(M\u03b5i ) \u2282 M1 (\u03b50 ). Additionally for i > n, each \u039e(M\u03b5i ) is a single\nembedded circle.\nWe consider two cases; either there exists an infinite sequence of points {xi }i \u2282 \u039e(M\u03b5i ) \u2229\nM1 (\u03b50 ) (case 1\u25e6 ), or not (case 2\u25e6 ).\nProof of the claim in case 1 \u25e6 . By compactness of M1 (\u03b50 ), we can choose a convergent subsequence of {xi }i . We denote the subsequence by {x\u0302j }j and its limit by x\u0302. According to\nLemma 3.7, x\u0302 \u2208 \u039e(M1 ) \u2282 M1 (\u03b50 ). By assumption (i) on p. 10, for each j we have an\nembedding \u03c6j : S 1 \u0592\u2192 M\u03b5j such that for some \u03b8j \u2208 S 2 , \u03c6j (\u03b8j ) = x\u0302j . If \u03b5j is sufficiently\nsmall, all elements of x\u0302j belong to a geodesic ball Dx\u0302 (r\u0302) \u2282 M1 (\u03b50 ) around x\u0302 of arbitrarily\nsmall radius r\u0302. To prove the claim, we reason by contradiction. Suppose that there exists\na subsequence {m} of {j} such that \u03c6m (S 1 ) * M1 (\u03b50 ). Then for each m there is a point\n\u03b8m where \u03c6m (\u03b8m ) \u2208\n/ M1 (\u03b50 ). Consequently, \u03c6m : (\u03b8m , \u03b8m ) \u0592\u2192 M\u03b5m is an oriented path\njoining two different points, one in M1 (\u03b50 ), the other in M\u03b5m \\ M1 (\u03b50 ). Clearly, the path\n\u03c6m |(\u03b8m ,\u03b8m ) has to intersect \u2202M1 (\u03b50 ). Choose a convergent subsequence of intersection points\nym \u2208 \u2202M1 (\u03b50 ). Its limit y \u2208 \u2202M1 (\u03b50 ) belongs to \u039e(M1 ) by Lemma 3.7. As a consequence,\nthe intersection \u039e(M1 ) \u2229 \u2202M1 (\u03b50 ) would have to be nonempty which contradicts the choice\nof \u03b50 (i.e. the nodal line \u039e(M1 ) is supposed to be at some geodesic distance d > \u03b50 from the\nboundary of the gluing disc.) Therefore, there exists an index n such that \u03c6j (S 1 ) \u2282 M1 (\u03b50 )\nfor all j > n. The image of S 1 under \u03c6j is a closed embedded curve in M1 (\u03b50 ) \u2243 D 2 which\n14\n\n\fsplits M\u03b5j into two domains, where the eigenfunction is either strictly positive or negative\n(a \u2206\u03a3 -eigenfunction cannot have a zero so there is no change of sign in the neighborhood).\nBy Courant's Theorem, the first eigenfunction must have exactly two nodal domains, hence\n\u03c6j (S 1 ) = \u039e(M\u03b5j ).\nProof of the claim in case 2 \u25e6 . If there is no infinite sequence {xi }i \u2282 \u039e(M\u03b5i ) \u2229 M1 (\u03b50 ), then\nthere exists an index n such that for any i > n, \u039e(M\u03b5i ) \u2282 M2 (1). Again by Courant's\nTheorem, for each i > n, M\u03b5i \\ \u039e(M\u03b5i ) consists of two connected disjoint open subsets M\u03b5+i ,\n+(\u2212)\nM\u03b5\u2212i of M\u03b5i , defined as M\u03b5i\n= {x \u2208 M\u03b5i ; f11,\u03b5i (x) > (<)0}. As a result M1 (\u03b50 ) \u2282 M\u03b5+i , or\nM1 (\u03b50 ) \u2282 M\u03b5\u2212i , for all i > n. The convergence f11,\u03b5i \u2212\u2192 f1 in C 0 (M1 (\u03b50 )) implies that f1\nhas to be either nonnegative on M1 (\u03b50 ) or nonpositive. But this cannot happen, because\n\u039e(M1 ) \u2282 M1 (\u03b50 ) and f1 has to change sign on M1 (\u03b50 ).\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nLemma 2.7 \"ties\" the nodal set of an eigenfunction to dividing curves of an induced contact\nstructure. It would be very interesting to show that dividing curves of an arbitrary contact\nstructure are nodal lines in some suitably adapted metric.\nProblem 4.1. Let (M, \u03be) be a contact 3-manifold and \u03a3 an embedded convex surface.\nCan one adapt a metric g to \u03be in a tubular neighborhood of \u03a3 so that the dividing curves\ncorrespond to nodal lines of a \u2206\u03a3 -eigenfunction on (\u03a3, g\u03a3 ) ?\nSince isotopic contact structures have isotopic dividing curves, in the formulation of the\nabove problem we can allow the distribution \u03be to vary up to isotopy. If the answer to\nProblem 4.1 is \"yes\" one could rephrase questions about nodal lines in terms of dividing\ncurves and vice versa. Especially, one could try to address questions of the following type\nusing topological techniques.\nProblem 4.2. What kind of nonsingular nodal lines are admissible by a given compact\norientable surface \u03a3? In other words, can we realize a given collections of embedded closed\ncurves {\u0393i }i on \u03a3 as nodal lines (possibly up to isotopy) for some Riemannian metric g\u03a3 on\n\u03a3.\nThere are some obvious restrictions on the family {\u0393i }i , e.g. it must divide the surface\n\u03a3. To generate examples of such families, we could adapt the technique from Section 3. It\nseems possible to start with a generic nodal set embedded into a 2-sphere S 2 and \"implant\"\na finite number of small handles (as pictured on Figure 1), which collapse to centers of\nattaching circles, as a parameter \u03b5 \u2192 0. By similar reasoning as in Section 3.3 we could find\na \"generic\" metric on a surface obtained during this process, with the nodal set isotopic to\nthe initial nodal set on S 2 . One could also start with an arbitrary orientable surface and\ncarry out the implanting procedure. It may also be interesting to relate this to gluing of\ncontact structures along convex surfaces with Legendrian boundary (see [18]).\n15\n\n\fIn the context of Giroux's Theorem 2.4, and the active search for the classification result\nfor tight contact structures, it may be interesting to address the following problem.\nProblem 4.3. Find conditions, if any, on the curvature of a closed surface so that all the\nnodal lines of a \u2206\u03a3 -eigenfunction are homotopically nontrivial.\nThe hyperbolic case would seem to be of special interest here.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAdvice and comments from M.
