We\ncalculate the highest volume ratio known up to this date, 1.16, which is\ngenerated by our second example.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe shadows of two-dimensional objects are line segments, so it is easy to construct examples of two objects such that one hides behind the other but has a\nlarger area than the other. However, in three dimensions, since shadows have\nshapes, the question is more complicated. In [1], it was shown that in three\ndimensions, there exist two convex bodies such that one can hide behind the\nother but have a larger volume than the other. Examples that invoke Minkowski\nsums were presented in [2], but optimal ratios were not calculated. Recently,\nin [4], it was shown that in n dimensions, the optimal volume ratio for two\nn n\n) , which decreases monotonically and\nsuch objects is bounded above by ( n\u22121\napproaches e \u2248 2.718 as n approaches infinity. In particular, a universal bound\nof 2.942 was obtained, which is the value of the expression for n = 7 and which\ncan be easily verified for n \u2264 6.\nHere, we present two examples and calculate the optimal numerical ratios for\neach. In particular, our examples require the Minkowski sums of a tetrahedron\nand a ball and a tetrahedron and an inverted tetrahedron. The optimal volume\nratio calculated for the first example is 1.12, and the optimal volume ratio\ncalculated for the second example is 1.16.\n\n1\n\n\fIn Section 2, we define all the relevant terms and present two two-dimensional\nexamples of pairs of objects such that one can hide behind another but have\na bigger area than the other. In Section 3 and Section 4, we present our new\nexamples. In Section 5, we conclude with ideas for continued research.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nDefinitions\nHiding Behind\n\nDefinition 1. Define a shadow of an n-dimensional body K as an orthogonal\nprojection of K onto Rn\u22121 . A body A is defined to be able to hide behind a body\nB if the orthogonal projection of B contains a translation of the corresponding\northogonal projection of A in every direction.\n\u221a\n\nFor example, in Figure 1, a disk of radius 43 can hide behind a unit equi\u221a\nlateral triangle. The shadows of the disk are line segments of length 23 , and\n\u221a\nthe shadows of the triangle are line segments ranging in length from 23 to 1.\n\nFigure 1: The disk hides behind the triangle.\n\n2.2\n\nMinkowski Sum\n\nDefinition 2. The Minkowski sum of two sets A and B in a vector space is\nthe set obtained by adding every element in A to every element in B, expressed\nas\nA + B = {a + b | a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B}.\nFor example, Figure 2 illustrates the Minkowsi sum of a square and an\nequilateral triangle, both scaled by 21 .\n2\n\n\f1\n2\n\n+\n\n1\n\n=\n\n2\n\nFigure 2: The Minkowski sum of a scaled equilateral triangle and a scaled\nsquare.\n\nWe can also define the Minkowski interpolation of two objects A and B as\nthe Minkowski sum of \u03b1A and \u03b2B, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are scaling constants.\nLemma 1. For convex bodies A, B, and C, if A and B can hide behind C, then\nfor any \u03bc such that 0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 1, \u03bcA + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)B can hide behind C.\nProof. For an n-dimensional body A and a unit vector u in Rn , define Au to\nbe the projection of A onto the subspace u\u22a5 . Since A and B can hide behind\nC, there exist vectors x, y \u2208 u\u22a5 such that Au + x \u2286 Cu and Bu + y \u2286 Cu . It\nfollows that\n\u03bcAu + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)Bu + [\u03bcx + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)y] = \u03bc(Au + x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)(Bu + y)\n\u2286 \u03bcCu + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)Cu = Cu .\nSince the projection of the sum is the sum of the projections,\n[\u03bcA + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)B]u = \u03bcAu + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)Bu ,\nso \u03bcA + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)B can also hide behind C.\nLemma 2. For a scaling constant s, 0 < s < 1, such that sA can hide behind B,\nand any constant t, 0 < t < 1, the volume of the Minkowski sum tsA + (1 \u2212 t)B\nis maximized when s is maximized.\nProof. Invoking mixed volumes, the volume of the Minkowski sum can be expressed as\nt3 s3 V (A) + 2t2 s2 (1 \u2212 t)V (A, A, B) + 3ts(1 \u2212 t)2 V (A, B, B) + (1 \u2212 t)3 V (B).\nNote that this is a polynomial expression with respect to s with positive coefficients. It follows that this expression is maximized when s is maximized.\n\n3\n\n\f2.3\n\nTwo-Dimensional Examples\n\nIn two dimensions, the Minkowski interpolation of a triangle and a disk can hide\nbehind the original triangle but not hide inside it. See Figure 3.\n\nH1-\u039cL\n\n+\n\n\u039c\n\n=\n\nr\n\ns\n\nFigure 3: Minkowski sum of triangle and disk.\n\n\u221a\n\nAlthough the original disk, with radius 43 , which has a larger area than the\nunit triangle, can hide behind the triangle, invoking Minkowski sums generates\na shape with a greater area ratio. More precisely,\u221athe area ratio is maximized\n\u221a3\u03c0 \u2248 0.22, generating the\nby the Minkowski sum of the disk scaled by 6\u2212\n8\u2212 3\u03c0\napproximate area ratio 1.39.\nAs another example, the Minkowski interpolation of a triangle and an inverted triangle can hide behind the original disk but not hide inside it. See\nFigure 4. The area ratio is maximized by the Minkowski sum of both shapes\nscaled by 21 , generating the area ratio 1.5, which is the optimal area ratio in two\ndimensions, by Steiner's Theorem.\n\nH1-\u039cL\n\n+\n\n\u039c\n\n=\n\u039c\n1-\u039c\n\nFigure 4: Minkowski sum of triangle and inverted triangle.\n\nNote that the case involving two triangles generates a higher area ratio than\nthe case involving a triangle and a disk. This result extends to three dimensions,\n4\n\n\fas will be shown in the next two sections, which describe two three-dimensional\nexamples involving a tetrahedron.\n\n3\n\nTetrahedron and Ball\n\nOne example in which one body can hide behind another body of smaller volume is generated by the Minkowski interpolation of a tetrahedron and a ball.\nSuppose a unit tetrahedron is positioned\nq in the coordinate plane with vertices at\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\n(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), ( 12 , 23 , 0), ( 21 , 63 , 23 ). By Lemma 2, to calculate the highest\nvolume ratio in this example, it is necessary to first calculate the radius of the\nlargest circle that can always be contained in the shadow of the tetrahedron, in\nother words, the smallest inradius of all possible orthogonal projections of the\ntetrahedron.\nLemma\n3. The smallest inradius of all possible shadows of the tetrahedron is\n\u221a \u221a\n6\u2212 2\n.\n4\nProof. All possible orthogonal projections onto the xy-plane can be obtained\nby rotating the tetrahedron first clockwise about the x-axis by \u03b1 degrees and\nthen counterclockwise about the y-axis by \u03b2 degrees, which is sufficient because\nonly the shape and not the configuration of the projection is relevant, as all the\northogonal projections of a ball are disks. The new coordinates of the vertices\nof the tetrahedron after these transformations can be explicitly calculated by\nmatrix multiplication involving the rotation matrices\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\ncos \u03b2 0 sin \u03b2\n1\n0\n0\n\uf8ed0 cos \u03b1 \u2212 sin \u03b1\uf8f8 and \uf8ed 0\n1\n0 \uf8f8.\n\u2212 sin \u03b2 0 cos \u03b2\n0 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1\nFor example, for the vertex (1, 0, 0), we have\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n1\ncos \u03b2\n1\n0\n0\ncos \u03b2 0 sin \u03b2\n\uf8ed 0\n1\n0 \uf8f8 \uf8ed0 cos \u03b1 \u2212 sin \u03b1\uf8f8 \uf8ed0\uf8f8 = \uf8ed 0 \uf8f8 .\n\u2212 sin \u03b2 0 cos \u03b2\n0 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1\n0\n\u2212 sin \u03b2\nTherefore, after the rotations, the coordinates of the projections of the vertices\nof the unit tetrahedron onto the xy-plane are\n(0, 0, 0) \u2212\u2192 (0, 0)\n\n(1, 0, 0) \u2212\u2192 (cos \u03b2, 0)\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n3\n1\n3\n3\n( ,\n, 0) \u2212\u2192 ( cos \u03b2 +\nsin \u03b1 sin \u03b2,\ncos \u03b1)\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n5\n\n\fr\nr\n\u221a r\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3\n2\n1\n3\n2\n3\n2\n1\n,\n) \u2212\u2192 ( cos \u03b2+\nsin \u03b1 sin \u03b2+\ncos \u03b1 sin \u03b2,\ncos \u03b1\u2212\nsin \u03b1).\n( ,\n2 6\n3\n2\n6\n3\n6\n3\nThe shadow obtained by any projection is defined by the convex hull of these\ncoordinates.\nEmploying this procedure, we wrote a program that verified that the radius\nof the largest disk\nthat can be contained in all orthogonal projections of the\n\u221a \u221a\n2\n, which is obtained by projecting parallel to one of the\ntetrahedron is 6\u2212\n4\nfaces of the tetrahedron.\nTheorem 1.

See Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 for a tetrahedron, an inverted\ntetrahedron, and the Minkowski sum obtained by scaling the tetrahedrons by\nsome constants s and 1 \u2212 s.\n\nFigure 5: A tetrahedron rotated.\n\nFigure 6: A scaled and inverted tetrahedron.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 7: Minkowski interpolation of tetrahedron and inverted tetrahedron.\n\nLemma 4. The largest inverted tetrahedron whose orthogonal projections can\nalways be contained in the corresponding shadows of a unit tetrahedron has side\nlength 12 .\nProof. By Lutwak's Containment Theorem in [5] and in [3], in two dimensions,\nany shape K contains a translate of \u2212 21 K. Since the shadows of 4 and \u22124 are\ntwo-dimensional, it follows that each projection of 4 contains a translate of the\ncorresponding projection of \u2212 12 4, so \u2212 21 4 can hide behind 4.\nTo prove that this bound is sharp, note the projection perpendicular to the\nbases of the tetrahedra, which generates equilateral triangle shadows. It is clear\nthat \u2212 12 4 can hide behind 4 but \u2212x4 cannot hide behind 4 for any x > 21 .\nTheorem 2. The maximum volume ratio for the Minkowski interpolation of\na tetrahedron and \u221a\nan inverted tetrahedron is obtained by scaling the inverted\n1+2 14\ntetrahedron by\n\u2248 0.77121003, and the corresponding volume ratio is\n11\napproximately 1.1633587.\nProof. For the appropriate parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 = 1\u2212\u03b1\n2 , the volume of the\nMinkowski interpolation of the tetrahedron and the inverted tetrahedron can\nbe expressed, by means of mixed volumes, as\nV [\u03b14 + \u03b2(\u22124)]\n= \u03b13 V (4) + 3\u03b12 \u03b2V (4, 4, \u22124) + 3\u03b1\u03b2 2 V (4, \u22124, \u22124) + \u03b2 3 V (\u22124).\nWe have that V (4, 4, \u22124) = V (4, \u22124, \u22124) = cV (4), where c4 circumscribes \u22124. It is clear that c = 3, as a tetrahedron circumscribes the inverted tetrahedron formed by connecting the centroids of its faces. Therefore,\n9\n\n\fV (4, 4, \u22124) = V (4, \u22124, \u22124) = 3V (4), and the volume expression expands\nto\n9\n9\n1\n[\u03b13 + \u03b12 (1 \u2212 \u03b1) + \u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b1)2 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)3 ]V (4).\n2\n4\n8\n\u221a\n\nThis function is maximized at \u03b1 = 1+211 14 \u2248 0.77121003, which generates the\nmaximum volume approximately 0.137103138 and the volume ratio approximately 1.1633587.\nNote that this is better than the ratio for the previous example. This case\nand the two-dimensional case, which is known, suggest the following conjecture.\nConjecture 1. In any dimension n, the best volume ratio is generated by the\nMinkowski interpolation of a simplex and an inverted simplex.\n\n5\n\nFuture Research\n\nThe question of whether our examples indeed generate the best volume ratio is\nstill unsolved. The current ratio bounds are a lot bigger than our calculations,\nalthough patterns certainly suggest that we have calculated the highest ratio.\nIn addition, although we only investigated examples involving Minkowski sums\nin our paper, this does not preclude the existence of any examples that do not\nrequire Minkowski sums.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am grateful to Tanya Khovanova for mentoring me in this project, for suggesting many impressive ideas, and for teaching me many of the technical skills\nrequired for the calculations and graphics for this paper.
