Such objects arise as a highly nontrivial consequence of collective nonlinear dynamics of the fields. In contradistinction\nto topological defects which appear because of a frustration of the field interpolating between different degenerate vacua, the Q-balls exist in models with non\ndegenerate vacuum. They must be taken into account in every thorough analysis\nof the dynamics of the fields.\nIn a recent paper [3] we have shown that the Q-balls can be found also in the\ncomplex signum-Gordon model. They differ from other Q-balls by their strictly\nfinite size: the vacuum field \u03c8 = 0 outside a spherically symmetric Q-ball is\nreached at a finite radius R, and it is approached in a parabolic manner. Such\nparabolic behavior is the general feature of field theoretic models with V-shaped\nself interaction terms [4]. It is a consequence of the fact that the field theoretic\nforce density, which in the case of the complex signum-Gordon model with the\ncomplex scalar field \u03c8 is given by \u2212\u2202U/\u2202\u03c8 \u2217 , where U = \u03bb|\u03c8| and \u03bb > 0 is the\nself coupling constant, does not vanish in the limit \u03c8 \u2192 0. Therefore, for weak\nfields it is always stronger than the gradient force (\u223c \u25b3\u03c8) which alone would lead\nto an infinitely long tail in the spatial asymptotics of the field, and also stronger\nthat the mass term (\u223c m2 \u03c8) which together with the gradient force would lead to\nthe well-known exponential asymptotics for the field. Heuristically, one can say\nthat the parabolic behavior is due to the fact that the field resists with a finite force\ndensity even the slightest deviations from the vacuum configuration. The self\ninteraction term U(|\u03c8|) = \u03bb|\u03c8| is V-shaped because its plot has the form of the\ninverted symmetric cone with the vacuum field \u03c8 = 0 right at the tip. The models\nwith V-shaped potentials are interesting for several reasons [4]. Let us mention\nhere a scaling symmetry of the on-shell type, and the lack of a free field regime\nbecause the field equations can not be linearized around the vacuum solution. In\ncase of smooth self interactions the second derivative of pertinent field potential\nat \u03c8 = 0 gives a mass scale which is physically important in the vacuum sector.\nDefined in this manner mass scale is infinite if the potential is V-shaped.\nThe motivation for the present paper comes from the idea that the finite vacuum restoring force can perhaps win over the electrostatic repulsion for arbitrarily\nlarge electrically charged Q-balls. In order to address this question we extend\nthe complex signum-Gordon model by including an Abelian gauge field A\u03bc minimally coupled to the scalar field. Thus, the global U(1) symmetry is replaced by\nthe local one. The considered model is a version of scalar electrodynamics.\n2\n\n\fIt has turned out that in such scalar electrodynamics there exist electrically\ncharged Q-balls provided that the absolute value of the total electric charge Q is\nsmall enough. For larger values of |Q| we find, rather surprisingly, Q-shells with\ncompletely empty interior. Ther is no upper bound on |Q|. Both Q-balls and Qshells are static, spherically symmetric, and the charge density exactly vanishes\noutside certain finite, Q-dependent radius R. The scalar field approaches its vacuum value \u03c8 = 0 in the parabolic manner, while the electric field of course has\nthe standard Coulomb tail. The total energy is finite. Another very interesting\nfinding is a zigzag in the plot of the total energy versus the total electric charge Q\nat intermediate values of Q, where the Q-balls transform into the Q-shells.\nIn literature one can find several other versions of scalar electrodynamics with\nQ-balls, see [5, 6, 7, 8]. In all of them there exists a maximal value of the total\nelectric charge the static Q-balls can have. Q-shells were not found. In our case\nthe electric charge can be arbitrarily large, but there is the transition from Q-balls\nto Q-shells at certain intermediate value of the charge.\nThe plan of our paper is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the model\nand discuss field equations for the spherical solitons. The Q-ball solutions for\nsmall values of |Q| are presented in Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the Q-shell\nsolutions in the case of large values of |Q|. The transition from Q-balls to Qshells at the intermediate values of |Q| is studied in Section 5. Section 6 contains\na summary and remarks.\n\n2 Preliminaries\nThe Lagrangian of our model has the following form\n1\nL = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + (D\u03bc \u03c8)\u2217 D \u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 \u03bb|\u03c8|,\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the complex scalar field in (3 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time,\n\u03bb > 0 is the self coupling constant, |\u03c8| is the modulus of \u03c8, D\u03bc \u03c8 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 +iqA\u03bc \u03c8,\nwhere q > 0 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and A\u03bc is the U(1) gauge\nfield. For the sake of convenience the fields \u03c8, A\u03bc , the space-time coordinates x\u03bc\nand the constants \u03bb, q are dimensionless. Of course, in physical applications they\nshould be multiplied by certain dimensional constants. Euler-Lagrange equations\ngive the Maxwell equations\n\u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd = j \u03bd\n(2)\n\n3\n\n\fwith the current density\nj \u03bd = iq (\u03c8 \u2217 \u2202 \u03bd \u03c8 \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c8) \u2212 2q 2 A\u03bd \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c8,\n\n(3)\n\nand the scalar field equation\nD \u03bc D\u03bc \u03c8 = \u2212\n\n\u03bb \u03c8\n.\n2 |\u03c8|\n\n(4)\n\nBy definition, the r.h.s. of Eq. (4) is equal to 0 when \u03c8 = 0 (see Section II in\n[3]). The field potential\nq U(|\u03c8|) = \u03bb|\u03c8| can be regarded as the limit of the smooth\npotential Ua (|\u03c8|) = \u03bb a + |\u03c8|2 when a \u2192 0+.\nWe will consider the simplest static, spherically symmetric Q-balls with vanishing magnetic field. The corresponding Ansatz has the form\n~ = 0, A0 = A0 (r).\n\u03c8 = ei\u03c9t F (r), A\n\n(5)\n\nHere F (r) is a real function of the radial coordinate r and \u03c9 > 0 is a constant real\nfrequency. The spatial part of the Maxwell equations is trivially satisfied, while\nthe Gauss law has the form\n\u25b3A0 = 2q(\u03c9 + qA0 )F 2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u25b3 is the three dimensional Laplacian. The scalar field equation is reduced\nto\n\u03bb\n\u25b3F + (\u03c9 + qA0 )2 F = signF,\n(7)\n2\nwhere sign(0) = 0. Equations (6), (7) acquire a simpler form when we change a\nlittle bit the notation. With\n\u221a\n\u03bbq\n\u03ba = \u221a , G = 2qF, B = \u03c9 + qA0 ,\n2\nwe obtain the following equations\n\u25b3B = BG2 ,\n\n\u25b3G = \u2212GB 2 + \u03ba signG.\n\nNote that the fields B, G are gauge-invariant as opposed to A0 , \u03c8 and \u03c9 (the\nAnsatz (5) fixes the gauge only partially because the U(1) gauge transformations\nwhich depend only on time are still allowed).\n4\n\n\fFurthermore, the parameter \u03ba can be removed with the help of rescaling\nB(r) \u2192 \u03ba1/3 B(\u03ba1/3 r),\n\nG(r) \u2192 \u03ba1/3 G(\u03ba1/3 r),\n\nr \u2192 \u03ba1/3 r,\n\nand therefore we may put \u03ba = 1 without any loss of generality. After taking into\naccount the spherical symmetry we finally obtain the following equations\n2\nB \u2032\u2032 = \u2212 B \u2032 + BG2 ,\n(8)\nr\n2\n(9)\nG\u2032\u2032 = \u2212 G\u2032 \u2212 GB 2 + signG,\nr\nwhere \u2032 denotes the derivative d/dr. These equations are supplemented by two\nconditions. First, continuity of \u2207\u03c8, \u2207A0 at r = 0 implies the conditions\nB \u2032 (0) = 0 = G\u2032 (0).\n\n(10)\n\nSecond, because Eqs. (8), (9) together with the condition (10) are invariant under\nthe transformations\nB(r) \u2192 \u2212B(r),\n\nG(r) \u2192 \u2212G(r),\n\nwe may also assume that\nB(0) \u2265 0, G(0) \u2265 0.\n\n(11)\n\nWe shall see that in fact B(0) > 0.\nThe total electric charge Q and the total energy E are given by the following\nformulas\nZ\nZ\n4\u03c0 \u221e\n3\n0\nQ= d xj =\u2212\ndr r 2 BG2 ,\n(12)\nq 0\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1\n2\u03c0\n3\n2\n2\n\u2217\nE= dx\n(\u2207A0 ) + |D0 \u03c8| + \u2207\u03c8 \u2207\u03c8 + \u03bb|\u03c8| = 2 E,\n2\nq\nwhere\nZ \u221e\n\u2032\n\u2032\nE=\ndr r 2 [B 2 + G 2 + B 2 G2 + 2\u03ba|G|].\n(13)\n0\n\nAs already signalled, we put \u03ba = 1.\nThe Q-balls and Q-shells are represented by solutions of Eqs. (8), (9) which\nobey the conditions (10), (11) and have finite Q and E. Let us have a look at Eq.\n(8). It can be written in the integral form\n1\nB (r) = 2\nr\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nr\n\n\u2032\n\ndr \u2032 r 2 B(r \u2032 )G2 (r \u2032 ),\n\n0\n\n5\n\n\fwhich implies that the function B(r) can not decrease when r increases because\nB \u2032 (0) \u2265 0. Furthermore, we shall shortly see that in the case of Q-balls and Qshells G(r) vanishes for all r > R, where R is the finite radius of the cloud of the\nelectric charge. Therefore, B \u2032 (r) = Q/r 2 for r > R, where\nqQ\n,\n(14)\n4\u03c0\n0\nand in consequence, B(r) = \u03b2 \u2212 Q/r for large r. The usual condition that the\nelectrostatic potential A0 vanishes at the spatial infinity and the definition of the\nfunction B imply that \u03b2 = \u03c9. Hence, for r > R\nQ=\n\nZ\n\nR\n\ndr r 2 BG2 = \u2212\n\nQ\n.\n(15)\nr\nIt follows that A0 (r) = Q/(4\u03c0r) for large r, as expected for the static spherically\nsymmetric, spatially localized electric charge distribution. 1\nIt is the well-known fact that Q-ball solutions in models with a global U(1)\nsymmetry minimize the total energy E under the condition that the U(1) global\ncharge is kept constant [1, 9]. Also in the considered case of local U(1) gauge\nsymmetry our Q-balls and Q-shells minimize the total energy, but one has to assume not only that the total electric charge Q is constant but also that the Gauss\nlaw (8) holds. This latter condition follows from the fact that the Gauss law is in\nfact a constraint which is essential for the physical content of the electrodynamics. Therefore the variations \u03b4B, \u03b4G have to be interrelated in such a manner that\nthe fields B + \u03b4B, G + \u03b4G also obey that constraint. It follows that in the linear\napproximation the admissible spherically symmetric variations obey the condition\nB(r) = \u03c9 \u2212\n\n2\n\u03b4B \u2032\u2032 = \u2212 \u03b4B \u2032 + G2 \u03b4B + 2BG \u03b4G.\nr\nUsing this constraint one can show that\n\u03b4E = 2\u03c9 \u03b4Q \u2212 2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nh\n\ni\n\ndrr 2 G\u2032\u2032 + 2G\u2032 /r + B 2 G \u2212 sign(G) \u03b4G.\n\nIt is clear that the conditions \u03b4E = 0, \u03b4Q = 0 imply Eq. (9). Moreover, it turns\nout that the second variation of the energy is positive because it can be written in\nthe form\n#\n\"\nZ \u221e\na(\u03b4G)2\n\u2032 2\n\u2032 2\n2\n2\n2\ndr r (\u03b4B ) + (\u03b4G ) + (G\u03b4B + B\u03b4G) +\n\u03b4 E=\n(a + G2 )3/2\n0\n1\n\nNote that with our sign conventions the total electric charge Q is negative while Q > 0. We\ncall Q the charge and Q the total electric charge.\n\n6\n\n\f(here we use the regularized version Ua (|\u03c8|) of the field potential). Thus, the\nQ-ball and Q-shell solutions indeed give local minima of the energy.\n\n3 The Q-balls\nQualitative analysis of solutions of the set of Eqs. (8), (9) can be accomplished\nwith the help of the standard tool: a mechanical analogy. In the context of Q-balls\nsuch interpretation of field equations was used already in [9]. Thus, we regard (8),\n(9) as Newton's equations of motion for a fictitious particle of unit mass moving in\nthe (B, G)-plane. Because of the assumptions (11) we actually consider motions\nin the first quarter of the plane. The radial coordinate r plays the role of time.\nThere are two forces acting on the particle: the friction force given by the twovector (\u22122B \u2032 /r, \u22122G\u2032 /r) and the external force f~ = (BG2 , signG \u2212 B 2 G). The\nexternal force does not have a potential, i.e., f~ 6= \u2212\u2207u with certain u. This fact\nreflects the different origins of Eq. (8) and (9): Eq. (8) is in fact the Gauss law for\nthe electric field, hence it is a constraint, while Eq. (9) comes from the dynamical\nevolution equation for the scalar field. The B component of f~ (equal to BG2 ) is\nnonnegative. This means that the particle is constantly pushed in the B direction\nuntil G = 0. The G component of f~ vanishes along the hyperbola GB 2 = 1 and\nalong the straight line G = 0. It is negative above that hyperbola (a 'northern\nslope') and positive when 0 < G < 1/B 2 (a 'southern slope'). One may imagine\nthat the particle moves in a curved valley with the bottom on the hyperbola, and\nthat there is a 'B-wind' which constantly pushes the particle in the positive B\ndirection.\nThe mechanical analogy presented above might seem relatively complicated,\nnevertheless it gives the right intuitions about the existence and the form of solutions of Eqs. (8), (9). For example, one can guess that perhaps the 'B-wind' can\njust push the particle along the bottom of the valley. This would mean that there\nexists a solution such that G(r)B 2 (r) = 1. Indeed, it turns out that this is the case:\nthe solution has the form\n\u221a\n\u03b30\nB(r) = \u03b20 r, G(r) = ,\nr\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\nwhere \u03b20 = 2/ 3, \u03b30 = 3/2. Unfortunately, this solution is not interesting\nas far as the Q-balls are concerned because it is singular at r = 0 and it has the\ninfinite total energy and charge.\nNote that there are no Q-balls such that B(0) = 0. In this case Eq. (8) and the\ncondition B \u2032 (0) = 0 imply that B(r) = 0 for all r \u2265 0, i.e., that the particle moves\n7\n\n\falong the G-axis. Then, it follows from Eq. (9) that G(r) = G(0) + r 2 /6. The\nelectric charge density for this solution vanishes, but the total energy is infinite.\nThe Q-ball solution corresponds to the trajectory of the particle which starts\nat the 'time' r = 0 with the vanishing initial velocity B \u2032 (0) = G\u2032 (0) = 0 from a\npoint (B(0), G(0)) lying on the 'northern slope', and reaches the B-axis at a finite\n'time' R, G(R) = 0. If at that 'time' also G\u2032 (R) = 0, then for r > R the particle\nmoves along the B-axis, asymptotically approaching the point (B, G) = (\u03c9, 0), as\nit follows from formula (15). It is stopped by the friction force, while the external\nforce f~ vanishes on the B-axis. The condition G\u2032 (R) = 0 means that the particle\nlands on the B-axis tangentially to it. This is possible because of the 'B-wind'.\nThe trajectories of the type described above correspond to the simplest Q-balls.\nMore complicated solutions can exist too, see the remark 4 in Section 6.\nWe have found the solutions of Eqs. (8), (9) corresponding to the above discussed trajectories numerically. For a given value of B(0) > 0 we have adjusted\nthe value of G(0) > 1/B 2 (0) until G(R) = 0 = G\u2032 (R) for a certain value of R.\nExample of such a numerical solution is shown in Fig. 1.\nG(r)\n\nB(r)\nG\n\n0.45\n\n3.38\nB\n\n0.36\n\n3.36\n\n0.27\n\n3.34\n\n0.18\n\n3.32\n\n0.09\n\n3.3\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nr\n\nFigure 1: Example of the Q-ball solution. For this solution B(0) =3.30, G(0) =\n0.49..., R =1.35..., B(R) =3.37..., Q = 0.05..., E =0.44..., \u03c9 = 3.41... .\n\nThe numerical analysis is nicely supplemented by an analytical approximation\nwhich works in the case of very large values of B(0). It is based on the observation\n8\n\n\fthat in this case the 'northern slope' is very steep and that the bottom of the valley\nlies very close to the B-axis. Therefore, the particle very quickly reaches the\nbottom of the valley and climbs the 'southern slope'. The 'B-wind' is relatively\nweak on that slope because it is proportional to G2 , see the r.h.s. of Eq. (8). Thus,\nwe may expect that the coordinate B of the particle is almost constant.\nLet us assume that B(r) is just constant, B(r) = B(0) for 0 \u2264 r \u2264 R and that\nB(0) is very large. Then Eq. (8) is approximately satisfied: because GB 2 \u2248 1\nclose to the bottom of the valley, the term BG2 is of the order B \u22123 (0) and it\nasymptotically vanishes when B(0) \u2192 \u221e. Equation (9) with constant B becomes\nordinary linear differential equation. It can easily be solved by the standard methods [10] in the intervals of r on which G has a constant sign. In the case G > 0\nthe general solution which obeys the conditions G\u2032 (0) = 0 has the form\nG(r) =\n\n1\nB 2 (0)\n\n+A\n\nsin(B(0)r)\n,\nr\n\n(16)\n\nwhere A is a constant. The condition G(R) = 0 gives\nA=\u2212\n\nB 2 (0)\n\nR\n,\nsin(B(0)R)\n\n(17)\n\nwhile the condition G\u2032 (R) = 0 yields the following relation\nB(0)R = c0 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere c0 is a solution of the equation\ntan c0 = c0 .\n\n(19)\n\nEquation (19) has infinitely many solutions, but only for\nc0 = 4.493...\n\n(20)\n\nthe function G(r) has positive values in the whole interval 0 \u2264 r < R as required.\nComparison with the numerical solutions shows that such approximate analytic\nsolution is quite accurate already for B(0) = 4 and of course it becomes more\naccurate with increasing value of B(0).\nThe charge for the approximate solution (16) is given by the formula\nQ=\n\n5 R6\n6 c30\n9\n\n(21)\n\n\f(the integral over r is elementary). Formula (15) taken for r = R implies that\n\u03c9 = B(0) + Q/R, and with the help of (18), (21)\n\u0012 \u00131/6 \"\n\n5\n\u03c9=\n6\n\n\u221a\n\nc0 Q\n\n\u22121/6\n\n#\n\n1\n+ \u221a Q 5/6 .\nc0\n\n(22)\n\nThe total energy E is calculated from formula (13). The integral is split into\nRR\nR\u221e\n2\n\u2032\n0 and R . In the latter one only B = Q/r does not vanish. Elementary\nintegrations yield the following formula\n\u0012 \u00131/6 \"\n\n5\nE=\n6\n\n#\n\n12 \u221a\n1\nc0 Q 5/6 + \u221a Q 11/6 .\n5\nc0\n\n(23)\n\nWe see from formulas (18)-(23) that the radius R, the charge Q, and the total\nenergy E decrease with increasing values of B(0) \u2013 the Q-ball becomes smaller\nand smaller. Its charge density (\u223c BG2 ) exactly vanishes outside the radius R =\n(6c30 /5)1/6 Q1/6 . Generally, the charge density has a maximum at the center (r =\n0), and it monotonically decreases towards zero, provided that Q is small enough.\nFor larger values of Q the charge density is maximal at a finite radius r > 0.\nThe approximate formulas (16) - (18) imply that the initial data (B(0), G(0))\nfor the pertinent trajectories of the fictitious particle lie on the curve\nG(0)B 2 (0) = 1 \u2212\n\n1\n= 5.603...,\ncos c0\n\n(cos c0 = \u22120.217...) which is plotted as the continuous line in Fig. 2. The thick\ndots denote the initial data determined numerically. It is clear that there is a very\ngood agreement if B(0) \u2265 4 what corresponds to Q \u2264 0.018.\nThe numerical investigations of the Q-balls for smaller values of B(0) (that\nis B(0) < 4) have shown, rather unexpectedly, that the initial data (B(0), G(0))\nmove to smaller values of G(0), see Fig. 2. The largest value of G(0) is obtained\nfor B(0) \u2248 1.5. When B(0) is still decreased the points (B(0), G(0)) move to the\n'southern slope' of the valley. Close to the end of the G(0) > 0 part of the dotted\nline in Fig. 2 the values of B(0) slightly increase. The end of the numerically\ndetermined Q-ball line has the coordinates B(0) = 1.317..., G(0) = 0 (Q =\n9.753..., E = 73.237..., \u03c9 = 4.546...).\nThe charge Q and the total energy E of the Q-balls first grow as we move along\nthe dotted line, but later they slightly decrease, see Section 5. The maximal values\nQ = 9.779... and E = 73.47... for the Q-balls are obtained for G(0) = 0.056...,\n10\n\n\fB(0) = 1.290.... On the other hand, the radius R always grows \u2013 its value at the\nend of the Q-ball line is R = 4.856.... The very interesting region of B(0) \u2248 1.3\nwith small values of G(0) is discussed in detail in Section 5.\n\nG(0)\n1\n\n0.75\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nB(0)\n\nFigure 2: The initial data for our numerical Q-ball and Q-shell solutions (represented by the thick dots). The bottom of the valley is marked by the thin dotted\nline. The continuous curve is given by the equation G(0)B 2 (0) = 5.603 obtained\nfrom the approximate analytic Q-ball solution (16). The thick dots on the line\nG(0) = 0 correspond to the Q-shells, and those with G(0) > 0 to the Q-balls. The\nthick dots represent the numerical solutions we have actually obtained - we do not\nsuggest that the full set of initial data is discrete.\n\nThe numerical solutions for the Q-balls show that for B(0) \u2248 1.3 and small\nvalues of G(0) the function G(r) and the charge density have maximal values at\ncertain radius r > 0, while at r = 0 there is a local minimum, see Fig. 3. In\nparticular, for B(0) = 1.317..., G(0) = 0, that is at the end of the Q-ball line, the\ncharge density exactly vanishes at r = 0. One may think that this Q-ball is empty\nat the center. Such interpretation immediately suggests the question whether there\nexist static Q-shells, for which the charge density does not vanish in a spherical\nshell with finite internal and external radiuses. It turns out that the answer is in the\naffirmative.\n\n11\n\n\fG(r)\n\nB(r)\n\n0.6\n\n2.5\nB\n2.25\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n2\n\nG\n\n0.3\n\n1.75\n\n0.2\n\n1.5\n\n0.1\n\n1.25\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\nr\n\nFigure 3: Example of a large Q-ball solution. The function G(r) has a local\nminimum at r = 0. For this solution B(0) = 1.2, G(0) = 0.221..., R = 4.76...,\nB(R) = 2.54..., Q = 9.52..., E = 71.2..., \u03c9 = 4.54...\n\n4 The Q-shells\nIn the case of Q-shells the function G(r) exactly vanishes when r \u2264 r0 and also\nwhen r \u2265 R > r0 . Hence, the electric charge is localized inside the spherical shell\ngiven by the condition r0 \u2264 r \u2264 R. The function B(r) has constant value equal\nto B(r0 ) in the interval 0 \u2264 r \u2264 r0 , and the Coulomb form (15) when r \u2265 R.\nThe corresponding trajectory of the particle from the mechanical analogy starts at\ncertain 'time' r = r0 > 0 from the point (B(r0 ), 0) on the B-axis, tangentially to\nthe axis, moves across the valley and climbs the 'northern slope' until G\u2032 = 0 at\na 'time' r1 > r0 when it reaches a turning point. Next, it again crosses the valley\nand comes back to the B-axis (tangentially to it) at the time R > r1 . Solutions of\nEqs. (8), (9) of that kind have been found numerically. An example is presented\nin Fig. 4.\nThe initial data for the trajectory of the fictitious particle in the case of Q-shells\nhave the coordinates (B(0), 0), where B(0) = B(r0 ). They lie on the horizontal\naxis in Fig. 2. The mechanical analogy suggests that the Q-shell solutions exist for\narbitrarily large values of B(r0 ). The initial 'time' r0 (equal to the internal radius\nof the Q-shell) is determined by a balance between the friction term \u22122G\u2032 /r and\nthe harmonic force \u2212GB 2 in Eq. (9). The point is that the values of B grow\nmonotonically with r because of the 'B-wind', and therefore the harmonic force\nis larger when the fictitious particle returns to the B-axis than during its flight to\n12\n\n\fthe 'northern slope'. For this reason the returning particle would just cross the\nB-axis and move to the G < 0 part of the (B, G)-plane were it not for the friction\nwhich can take away the right amount of energy from the particle (if r0 is suitably\nadjusted), so that G\u2032 = 0 exactly at the 'time' R when the particle reaches the\nB-axis. Thus, the friction term can not be neglected if the 'B-wind' is present.\nNote also that if we neglect the 'B-wind' (as in the case of large Q-shells\ndiscussed below) the friction would stop the particle before it returns to the Baxis. Therefore, as far as the Q-shell solutions are concerned the 'B-wind' and the\nfriction go together \u2013 we may keep or neglect only both.\n\nG(r)\n\nB(r)\n2.85\n\n0.6\n\n2.65\n\n0.5\n\nB\n2.45\nG\n\n0.4\n\n2.25\n0.3\n\n2.05\n\n0.2\n\n1.85\n\n0.1\n\n1.65\n1.45\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nr\n\nFigure 4: Example of the Q-shell solution. The function B(r) is constant for\nr < r0 = 1, and almost constant in the layer 1 \u2264 r \u2264 2 which lies inside the\nQ-shell. For this solution r0 = 1, B(0) = 1.452..., R = 5.06..., B(R) = 2.52...,\nQ = 10.27..., E = 78.00..., \u03c9 = 4.55....\n\nIn the case of large Q-shells significant simplifications appear and it is possible\nto find approximate analytic solutions. Because r0 is large, the friction term in\nEq. (9) may be neglected. Moreover, also B(r0 ) is assumed to be large. In this\nregion of the (B, G)-plane the valley is narrow and its northern slope is very steep.\nTherefore, the fictitious particle will return to the B-axis rather quickly and the\nend point (B(R), 0) of its trajectory will be close to the starting point (B(r0 ), 0).\n13\n\n\fThus, we may assume that B(r) \u2248 B(r0 ) in Eq. (9), i.e., that the 'B-wind' is\nnot important too. Numerical solutions show that indeed B(r) is almost constant\ninside large Q-shells, see Fig. 5.\n\nB(r)\n\nB (r)\n\n3.75\n\n0.05\n\n3.74\n\n0.04\n0.03\n\n3.73\n\nB\n\nB\n\n0.02\n\n3.72\n0.01\n3.71\n0\n100\n\n100.3\n\n100.6\n\n100.9\nr\n\n101.2\n\n101.5\n\nFigure 5: Example of the function B(r) with its derivative B \u2032 (r) for a large Qshell.

At values of r larger\nthan shown in the picture the function B(r) becomes constant and B \u2032 (r) decreases\nto zero.\n\nThe simplified form of Eq. (9) is as follows (G > 0)\nG\u2032\u2032 (r) = \u2212B 2 (r0 )G(r) + 1.\n\n(24)\n\nBoth the 'B-wind' and the friction have been neglected.

For example, for B(r0 ) = 3.083... we have obtained B(r0 )(R \u2212 r0 ) =\n6.261....\nRelation (27) gives R provided we know r0 and B(r0 ). B(r0 ) can be expressed\nby r0 and Q. To this end we use the definition (14) in which B(r) = B(r0 ) and\nG(r) is given by formulas (25), (26). Elementary integration gives the following\nformula\nQ = 3\u03c0B \u22126 (r0 )(x20 + 2\u03c0x0 + 4\u03c0 2 /3 \u2212 5/2),\n(28)\nwhere\nx0 = r0 B(r0 ).\nIt remains to determine r0 . Equation (24) is not helpful here because it is\ninvariant with respect to translations of r. We will determine r0 by minimizing\nthe total energy E under the condition that the charge Q has a fixed value. Here it\nis convenient to use another formula for the energy, namely\nQ2 Z R\n\u2032\nE = QB(R) +\n+\ndr r 2 (G 2 + 2|G|).\nR\nr0\n\n(29)\n\nIt follows from the definition (13) by applying Eq. (8) and integration by parts.\nPerforming the (elementary) integration in formula (29) and eliminating R and\nB(r0 ) with the help of formulas (27), (28) we obtain a rather lengthy formula for\nE which contains only Q and x0 . In the limit of large x0 it can be written in the\nform\n\u0014\n\u0015\n8\u03c0 \u22122/3\n1/6 5/6 8 1/3\n\u223c\n,\n(30)\nE = (3\u03c0) Q\nx + (Q + )x0\n3 0\n9\n\u22125/3\n\nwhere we have omitted terms of the order x0\nor smaller. The minimum of E is\nobtained for\n2\u03c0\n3\nx0 = Q +\n.\n(31)\n4\n3\nUsing this value of x0 we find that in the limit of large Q\n\u221a\n(32)\nE\u223c\n= 3 24/3 \u03c0 1/6 Q7/6 ,\n15\n\n\f27\u03c0\nB(r0 ) \u223c\n=\n16\n\u0012\n\n\u00131/6\n\nQ1/6 .\n\n(33)\n\nThen r0 \u223c Q5/6 , and R = r0 + 2\u03c0/B(r0 ). Comparison with numerical results\nshows that formulas (30-33) are quite accurate already for Q = 150 \u2013 in the case\nof E, B(r0 ) they give numbers which differ from the corresponding numerical\nresults by less than 1 percent, and for r0 it is less than 7 percent. Of course the\ndiscrepancies decrease when we go to larger values of Q.\n\n5 The transition from Q-balls to Q-shells\nThe transition from Q-balls to Q-shells occurs at Q\u2217 = 9.753.... The largest Qball has the radius R\u2217 = 4.85..., and the initial data is G(0) = 0, B(0) = 1.317....\nFor such small values of B(0) the 'B-wind' can not be neglected. In consequence,\nthe simple analytical approximations, successfully applied in the cases of small\nand large Q, do not work. We have studied the pertinent solutions of Eqs. (8), (9)\nnumerically, concentrating mainly on the global characteristics: the energy E and\nthe charge Q.\nLet us first briefly describe the general structure of the solutions. On the Q-ball\nside, the minimum of the function G at r = 0 gradually deepens until G(0) = 0.\nThe particle from the mechanical analogy starts its motion from the 'southern\nslope'. The 'B-wind' carries it to the northern side of the valley (then G(r) increases), where the particle makes a turn \u2013 at that moment G(r) has the maximal\nvalue. Next, it again crosses the bottom of the valley and climbs the 'southern\nslope' until it reaches the G = 0 axis at the 'time' r = R, tangentially to the\naxis (G\u2032 (R) = 0). For r > R the particle moves along the B-axis. It slows\ndown and approaches the point B(\u221e) = \u03c9 in the Coulomb way given by formula (15). On the Q-shell side, the solutions have the shape presented in Fig. 4.\nNote the influence of the 'B-wind': B(R) = 2.52... is significantly larger than\nB(0) = B(r0 ) = 1.45....\nOur main findings are presented in Fig. 6, where E and Q are plotted as the\nfunctions of the radius R (in the case of Q-shells it is the outer radius). It turns out\nthat R is a convenient independent variable because it monotonically grows when\nwe change the initial data along the thick dotted line in Fig. 2 starting from the\nsmall Q-balls end (G(0) > 0, B(0) >> 1). Rather surprisingly, close to R\u2217 the\ntotal energy and the charge of the large Q-balls decrease when R increases. The\nsame is true for the small Q-shells with the outer radius slightly above R\u2217 . Thus,\nthe functions E(R), Q(R) have one local maximum and one local minimum. As\n16\n\n\ffar as we can see from our numerical data the maxima occur at the same values\nof R. The same seems to be true for the minima. Note that the variations of\nE(R), Q(R) in this region of R are rather small.\nWe know that E(R) \u223c Q5/6 for small Q-balls (i.e., when Q << Q\u2217 ), and\nthat E(R) \u223c Q7/6 for large Q-shells (Q >> Q\u2217 ). Using the numerical results\nsummarized in Fig. 6 we have constructed the plot of E versus Q for Q in the\ninterval [9.73, 9.78]. It has the zigzag shape schematically shown in Fig. 7.\nThe two spikes correspond to the maxima and minima of E(R) and Q(R). The\npresence of spikes in the plot of energy versus charge was found in other models\nwith Q-balls long time ago, see, e.g., [11].\n\nQ-balls\n\nQ-shells\n\nE\n73.45\n73.37\n73.29\n73.21\n\nQ\n9.78\n9.77\n9.76\n9.75\n4.825 4.835 4.845 4.855 4.865 4.875\nR\n\nFigure 6: The plot of the energy E (the thick dots) and of the total charge Q (the\ntriangles) versus the radius R in the transition region.

The arrows\npoint in the direction of growing R. The dot on the uppermost line corresponds\nto the solution which separates the Q-balls from the Q-shells (B(0) = 1.317...,\nG(0) = 0). The upper spike corresponds to the maxima of E and Q, the lower\none to the minima.\n\n18\n\n\fIn consequence, dE/dQ is a continuous function of R at R1 . This means that the\ndirection tangent to the curve E(Q) changes infinitesimally when we infinitesimally cross the maximum. Completely analogous reasoning applies to the lower\nspike in Fig. 7 which corresponds to the minima of E(R), Q(R).\n\n6 Summary and remarks\n1. Let us summarize our results. We have shown with the help of the mechanical\nanalogy and of the numerical calculations that in the U(1) gauged signum-Gordon\nmodel there exist compact, electrically charged non topological solitons. They\nhave the form of the Q-balls if the modulus of the total electric charge is smaller\nthan Q\u2217 = 4\u03c0Q\u2217 /q, where Q\u2217 = 9.753... and q > 0 is the electromagnetic coupling constant. When |Q| > Q\u2217 we have found the Q-shells which are completely\nempty inside: the energy and the electric charge densities exactly vanish in a finite ball around the center of the soliton. While electrically charged Q-balls have\nbeen found also in other models [5, 6, 7, 8], the static Q-shells appear only in\nthe gauged signum-Gordon model. Our feeling is that this is connected with the\nfact that the scalar field of the signum-Gordon model reaches its vacuum value\n\u03c8 = 0 on a finite distance (in the parabolic manner), not only in the direction of\nthe infinity but also in the direction of the origin. Of course, also the electrostatic\nrepulsion is an important ingredient \u2013 it prevents the Q-shell form a collapse.\nFurthermore, we have found the approximate analytic solutions of the field\nequations which agree very well with the numerical results in the limits of very\nsmall and very large absolute values of the electric charge. This is especially\nimportant in the latter case because the purely numerical approach is not sufficient\nin order to convincigly tackle the limit |Q| \u2192 \u221e.\n2. It is interesting to see in detail the change of the exponent from 5/6 to\n7/6 in the dependence of the energy E on the charge Q when passing from the\nasymptotic regions of very small to very large charges. Note that the Figure 7\nreminds a first order phase transition in, e.g., van der Waals gas, [12]. We have\nnot found a good analytic approximation for solutions in the intermediate region.\n3. The formula given at the end of Section 2 shows that the second variation\nof the energy \u03b4 2 E is positive. Therefore the Q-balls and the Q-shells are stable\nagainst small radial perturbations. In general however the question of their stability is rather complex one if one considers also nonsymmetric perturbations. First,\nthey can perhaps decay by emitting small Q-balls and/or a scalar and electromagnetic radiation. We have checked on our numerical solutions that a split into two\n19\n\n\fobjects of the charge Q/2 is energetically forbidden only for small Q-balls (Q <\n1.62...). This of course does not prove that such a decay of large Q-balls in a finite\ntime is dynamically possible. Furthermore, the evolution of the perturbed solitons can be very nontrivial because of complicated electromagnetic interactions\nof currents and charges. Note also that the usual criterion for the global stability\nconsisting in excluding the possibility of evaporation by emission of quanta of the\nscalar field [1] is hard to apply in our case because the signum-Gordon model can\nnot be linearized if the scalar field is close to the vacuum field. Therefore, an estimate of the rest mass of the quanta is not available \u2013 it is a rather difficult problem\nwhich belongs to non perturbative quantum field theory.\n4. We have investigated only the simplest (elementary) Q-balls and Q-shells.\nThe mechanical interpretation of Eqs. (8), (9) suggests that there also exist solutions such that the charge density has several maxima. In this case the classical\nparticle travels along the valley for a longer time climbing the 'southern slope'\nmore than once until it finally settles on the B-axis. Also numerical investigations\nhave shown solutions of this type. The relation E(Q) for such complex Q-balls\nand Q-shells is not known as yet. Another open problem is their stability against\na decay into the elementary Q-balls and Q-shells.\n\n7 Acknowledgement\nThis work is supported in part by the MNII grant SPB 189/6.PRUE/2007/7.\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
