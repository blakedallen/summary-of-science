In spite of these differences at the microscopic scale, a unified picture of the collective critical\nbehaviour emerges in terms of the so-called order parameter \u03c6 of the transition, the nature of which depends on\nthe specific system while its fluctuations determine the\nphysical behaviour close to critical points. In particular,\nin the case of ferromagnetic materials, \u03c6(x, t) can be identified with the coarse-grained magnetization density at\npoint x and time t, whereas for a fluid A/B binary mixcrit\nture with critical concentrations ccrit\nA /cB , \u03c6 is given alcrit\ncrit\nternatively, by cA \u2212 cA or cB \u2212 cB where cA,B are the\nspace-time dependent concentrations of the species A and\nB, respectively. The thermal fluctuations of the order parameter field \u03c6 are correlated in space and time across\na typical correlation length \u03be and a (linear) relaxation\ntime tR . Upon approaching the critical point, \u03be and tR\nbecome much larger than the corresponding microscopic\nlength and time scales lmicr and \u03c4micr , respectively, resulting in a spatially collective and temporally slow behaviour\nwhich is characterized by a certain degree of universality.\n\nIn fact, the physics at scales much larger than \u03c4micr and\nlmicr becomes largely independent of the microscopic details of the system, depending only on its gross features\nsuch as the range of the microscopic interactions, internal\nsymmetries, spatial dimensionality d, conservation laws\netc. which characterize the so-called universality class of\nthe transition. Universality is primarily an experimental\nfact based on the evidence that, e.g., \u03be \u223c \u03be0 |r|\u2212\u03bd and\ntR \u223c \u03c40 |r|\u2212\u03bdz for r \u2261 (T \u2212 Tc )/Tc \u2192 0, where Tc is the\ncritical temperature, \u03be0 and \u03c40 specifically depend on the\nmicroscopic details of the system and therefore are nonuniversal, whereas \u03bd and z are universal exponents in the\nsense specified above [1,2]. Universality can be exploited in\norder to study the critical behaviour of a statistical system via suitable minimal models having the same gross\nfeature as the actual system and therefore belonging to\nthe same universality class. In most of the cases this is\ndone in terms of effective theories for the order parameter field \u03c6(x, t) and the resulting critical scaling properties\ncan be analyzed by means of powerful field-theoretical and\nrenormalization-group methods [1].\nThe slow and collective behaviour which emerges close\nto critical points affects relaxation phenomena and the\nway in which they actually occur. In Sect. 2 we discuss\nthe case of bulk systems, with particular emphasis on the\nemerging non-equilibrium properties, whereas in Sect. 3\nwe focus on confined critical systems in film geometry.\n\n\f2\n\nAndrea Gambassi: Relaxation phenomena at criticality\n\n2 Non-equilibrium relaxation in the bulk\nAltough the picture presented below is quite general, we\nshall refer specifically to the case of uniaxial ferromagnets\nbelonging to the Ising universality class, with a critical\ntemperature Tc and a space-time dependent order parameter \u03c6(x, t) (magnetization density).\nOne of the simplest instance of relaxation phenomena\ncan be observed after a sudden thermal perturbation. In\nfact, assume that a system, initially in equilibrium with a\nthermal bath at temperature T0 , is brought at time t = 0\nin contact with a thermal bath at temperature T 6= T0 .\nAs a consequence of this perturbation the system starts\nevolving out of equilibrium in a way which is expected to\ndepend on the specific initial condition (e.g., on T0 ). After this transient regime, of typical duration tEQ (T ), the\nsystem equilibrates with the thermal bath at temperature\nT , loses memory of the thermal quench and its dynamics\nbecomes stationary and invariant (in the absence of external fields) under time reversal; fluctuations are therefore\ndescribed by equilibrium dynamics. The duration tEQ (T )\nof the transient regime, i.e., of the relaxation, depends on\nthe temperature T and is such that tEQ (T > Tc ) is finite\nwhereas tEQ (T \u2264 Tc ) is actually infinite (in the thermodynamic limit) and the non-equilibrium relaxation goes\non forever. In particular, we focus here on the case of a\nquench to the critical point T = Tc , referring the reader\nto Ref. [3] for a discussion of the phase ordering dynamics\nfor T < Tc . The fact that tEQ (T = Tc ) is not finite is\nactually due to the emergent slow and collective critical\nbehaviour. In this context it is important to understand\nthe general features of this non-equilibrium relaxation, exploring, e.g., how it depends on the initial condition of the\nsystem. In particular \u2013 referring to Ising-like magnets \u2013 we\nwill consider the cases depicted in fig. 1 of quenches from\nan initial state with vanishing (A) and non-vanishing (B)\nmagnetization. In addition to the dependence on the ini-\n\nH\n\nin glassy systems, for example ageing (see, e.g., Ref. [7]\nfor a review). In this respect, critical dynamics provides\na valuable, non-trivial but relatively simple instance of\ndynamics with ageing, which can be characterized to an\nextent actually out of reach in more general cases of glassy\ndynamics.\n\n2.1 Dynamic observables\nThe relaxation process in a system of large volume V can\nbe monitoredPby looking at the global order parameter\n\u03a6(t) = V \u22121 x\u2208V \u03c6(x, t), its average over the possible\nrealization of the thermal noise M (t) = h\u03a6(t)i and its twotime connected correlation function C(t, s) = h\u03a6(t)\u03a6(s)iconn .\nIn addition to C(t, s) it is useful to analyse the linear response R(t, s) = \u03b4M (t)/\u03b4H(s)|H=0 of the global order parameter M (t) to a magnetic perturbation H(s) applied at\ntime s < t. With the aim of highlighting non-equilibrium\nbehaviours, we consider the so-called fluctuation-dissipation\nratio (originally introduced in the study of glasses [8,6])\nX(t, s) \u2261\n\nX \u221e \u2261 lim lim X(t, s).\n\nFig. 1. Quenches in the phase diagram of an Ising ferromagnet:\nT is the temperature of the bath, H the external magnetic field\nand (T, H) = (Tc , 0) is the critical point. The initial conditions\nA and B are characterized by a vanishing and non-vanishing\nmagnetization, respectively.\n\ntial condition, it is also of interest to understand how the\nuniversality which characterizes critical phenomena manifests itself in the long-time relaxation and if a scaling\nbehaviour actually emerges. Some of these issues were already addressed more than 30 years ago, with particular\nfocus on the dynamics of the order parameter [4,5]. Only\nquite recently, however, it has been realized [6] that dynamic correlations and susceptibilities display very interesting non-equilibrium properties such as those observed\n\n(2)\n\nt\u2192\u221e s\u2192\u221e\n\nIndeed, for t, s \u226b tEQ (T ) the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (see, e.g., Ref. [7]) implies X(t, s) = 1 and therefore X \u221e = 1 whenever equilibrium is eventually attained,\nwhich is always the case for T > Tc ; X \u221e 6= 1, instead,\nsignals that the system evolves out of equilibrium even at\nlong times. In particular, for quenches from the disordered\ninitial state (M (t < 0) = 0) to T < Tc and H = 0 (domain coarsening), scaling arguments yield X \u221e = 0, leading to the global picture in Fig. 2 [9].

The value of\nX \u221e for T = Tc depends on the universality class of the system.\n\nT = Tc , on the other hand, cannot be fixed on the basis of\ngeneral arguments but it depends on the specific system\n(actually on the universality class which it belongs to [9]).\nNote that, in contrast to the case of the non-equilibrium\ndynamics for T < Tc (phase ordering) in which thermal\nfluctuations do not affect the leading scaling behaviour [3],\nthe dynamics at T = Tc is actually driven by them and\n\n\fAndrea Gambassi: Relaxation phenomena at criticality\n\nby the emerging collective behaviour of the system. In recent years X \u221e has attracted a lot of attention in connection to the fact that, formally, it might be used to define\nan effective non-equilibrium temperature Teff for the system (see, e.g., Ref. [7] and references therein). Indeed, at\nlarge times, the rhs of Eq. (1) equals 1 (as required by\nthe equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem) if one assumes that the temperature of the system is not given by\nthe temperature T of the bath but by Teff = T /X \u221e. In the\ncase of mean-field glassy models it has been shown that\nTeff is actually a bona fide thermodynamic temperature\nwhich controls, e.g., the direction of heat flows [7]. In this\ncontext, the non-equilibrium critical relaxation provides a\nsimple instance of slow dynamics in which such a property\ncan be tested beyond mean field [10].\nTo give answers to the various questions posed so far,\nit is possible to fully exploit universality [9,11] in order\nto characterize within a field-theoretical approach [12,11]\nthe non-equilibrium critical relaxation and the associated\nageing phenomena (see Ref. [13] for a pedagogical introduction). This approach allows a systematic analysis of\nseveral aspects of these relaxation phenomena and yields\nanalytic predictions for scaling functions, exponents, and\namplitude ratios which characterize the scaling behaviour\nof correlation and response functions at large times, within\ndifferent universality classes and dynamics. In addition,\nit is possible to highlight dynamical crossovers in C(t, s),\nR(t, s) [14,15] and in the persistence properties of M (t) [16],\ndue to different initial conditions. Within this field-theoretical approach, for example, instead of studying on a lattice\nZd the non-equilibrium dynamics of the Ising model with\nspin-flip Glauber dynamics (which captures the behaviour\nof some anisotropic ferromagnets and alloys), one studies\nthe Landau-Ginzburg effective Hamiltonian H[\u03c6] [1] for\nthe order parameter \u03c6(x, t) (x \u2208 Rd ) with a suitable relaxational dynamics, known as Model A [2]:\n\u2202t \u03c6(x, t) = \u2212D\n\n\u03b4H[\u03c6]\n+ \u03b6(x, t).\n\u03b4\u03c6(x, t)\n\n(3)\n\nD is a kinetic coefficient and \u03b6(x, t) a zero-mean stochastic Gaussian noise with h\u03b6(x, t)\u03b6(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )i = 2kB T D \u03b4(x \u2212\nx\u2032 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). The results presented below refer to this case.\n\n2.2 Scaling behaviour\nThe renormalization-group analysis of Model A predicts\nthat R(t, s) and C(t, s) display the following scaling behaviours after a quench to T = Tc [17]:\n\ns < t,\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b8\nt\nFR (s/t, t/t0 ),\ns\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b8\u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3C(t, s) = AC ta+1 t\nFC (s/t, t/t0 ),\ns\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2R(t, s) = AR ta\n\n3\n\nexponent [17], FR,C are universal scaling functions normalized such that FR,C (0, 0) = 1. AR,C are non-universal\nconstants whereas t0 is a non-universal time scale set by\nthe initial value of the magnetization M0 \u2261 M (t = 0) and\ndisplays a universal dependence on it\n\u22121/\u03ba\n\nt0 = B m M 0\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the universal scaling exponent \u03ba > 0 is given, in\nterms of static and dynamic equilibrium and non-equilibrium exponents, by \u03ba = \u03b8+a+\u03b2/(\u03bdz). The non-universal\namplitude Bm can be fixed by suitable normalization conditions (see Refs. [17,14] for details).\nInterestingly enough, Eqs. (4) and (5) indicate that\nof the initial condition only the value M0 of the magnetization really matters in determining the scaling properties of the ensuing relaxation. A more detailed analysis\nshows that correlations in the initial state (as long as they\nare short ranged) do only contribute to corrections to the\nscaling behaviour [17]. According to Eq. (4), the two-time\nquantities C(t, s) and R(t, s) are homogeneous functions\nof the three time scales t, s, and t0 . In particular, when\ns < t \u226a t0 , which is always the case if M0 = 0, the scaling\nform of R (analogous one for C) becomes\n(0)\n\nR(t \u226a t0 , s) = AR ta (t/s)\u03b8 fR (s/t),\n(0)\n\nwhere fR (x) = FR (x, 0). Equation (6) clearly displays\nthe scaling behaviour typical of ageing phenomena: As a\nfunction of the time t at which the effect of the magnetic perturbation is measured, the relaxation time is set\nby the time s at which the perturbation was applied,\nwhich is also referred to as the age of the system, being the time elapsed since the quench. Upon increasing\ns the \"response\" to the magnetic perturbation becomes\nincreasingly slow. The scaling behaviour in Eq. (6) was\nalready spelled out in Ref. [17] even tough the connection with ageing has been realized some years later [6].\nIf M0 = 0 the scaling in Eq. (6) (and analogous for C)\nis valid also at long times and allows one to express X \u221e\nas an amplitude ratio X \u221e = AR /[(1 \u2212 \u03b8)AC ] [9,11]. This\namplitude ratio turns out to be universal and therefore\nits value calculated within the field-theoretical approach\ncan be compared with the corresponding results obtained\non the basis of different models in the same universality\nclass (e.g., Ising model with Glauber dynamics studied via\nMonte Carlo simulations).\nIn the opposite limit of large times compared to t0 ,\ni.e., t0 \u226a s < t the scaling form of R (analogous one for\nC) becomes [14]:\n(\u221e)\n\nR(t, s \u226b t0 ) = aR ta (t/s)\u2212\u03b2\u03b4/(\u03bdz) fR (s/t),\n(4)\n\nwhere a = (2 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2212 z)/z is given in terms of well-known\nuniversal equilibrium static (\u03b7) and dynamic (z) exponents [1], \u03b8 is the non-equilibrium universal initial-slip\n\n(6)\n\n(\u221e)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere fR (x) \u223c x\u03b8+\u03b2\u03b4/(\u03bdz) FR (x, y \u2192 \u221e) and aR is de(\u221e)\ntermined such that fR (0) = 1. Equation (7) displays\na scaling behaviour (with ageing) analogous to the one in\nEq. (6), with the major difference that the non-equilibrium\nexponent \u03b8 has been replaced by the combination \u2212\u03b2\u03b4/(\u03bdz)\nof equilibrium static and dynamic exponents. Also in this\n\n\f4\n\nAndrea Gambassi: Relaxation phenomena at criticality\n\ncase X \u221e can be expressed as an amplitude ratio X \u221e =\naR /{[1 + \u03b2\u03b4/(\u03bdz)]aC } where aC is the non-universal constant in the scaling form of C which corresponds to aR . According to Eqs. (6) and (7), as soon as the initial value M0\nof the magnetization is non-vanishing (quench from point\nB in Fig. 1), the asymptotic behaviour for large times\n(and therefore the value of X \u221e ) changes compared to the\ncase in which the initial value of the magnetization is zero\n(quench from point A in Fig. 1). An analogous conclusion\nhas been drawn for different universality classes [18,14,15].\nThe full scaling functions in Eq. (4) actually describe the\ncrossover which occurs, for a finite and fixed value of the\nmagnetization M0 (and therefore t0 ) when both times s\nand t increases from the case s < t \u226a t0 (described by\nEq. (6)) to the asymptotic case t0 \u226a s < t (described by\nEq. (7)).\nThe field-theoretical approach yields not only the predictions, previously discussed, for the scaling behaviour\nand the associated exponents but also analytic expressions for other relevant universal quantities such as the\nfluctuation-dissipation ratio and its asymptotic limit X \u221e .\nHere we focus on the specific case of the universality class\nof the Ising model with Glauber dynamics, although analogous predictions are available for different universality\nclasses and dynamics (see Ref. [11] for a review). In Fig. 3\nwe report the dependence of the asymptotic fluctuationdissipation ratio X \u221e (see Eqs. (1) and (2)) on the space\ndimensionality d of the model, after a quench from an\ninitial state with M0 = 0 (a) and M0 6= 0 (b) to the\ncritical point. The solid lines correspond to different Pad\u00e9\napproximants of the O(\u01eb2 ) (a) [19] and O(\u01eb) (b) [14] series\nwhich have been calculated within the field-theoretical \u01ebexpansion, where \u01eb = 4 \u2212 d. For d > 4 the mean-field predictions X \u221e (M0 = 0) = 1/2 and X \u221e (M0 6= 0) = 4/5\nbecome exact. The available Monte Carlo estimates in\nd = 2, 3, 4 [9,20] for M0 = 0 and in d = 2 for M0 6= 0 [14],\nreported in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively, are in quite\ngood quantitative agreement with the analytical predictions.\nIn summary, field-theoretical methods are a viable approach to investigate non-equilibrium and ageing phenomena during critical relaxation in the bulk. The long-time\nproperties of the non-equilibrium relaxation turn out to\ndepend on the initial condition (e.g., T0 ) via the corresponding magnetization M0 and novel crossovers in the\nresponse, correlation functions and persistence properties\nof M (t) [16] occur for finite M0 , as confirmed by Monte\nCarlo simulations. Within this approach one can also investigate the dependence of X \u221e \u2013 and therefore of the\neffective temperature Teff = T /X \u221e \u2013 on the observable\nused for its definition. Interestingly enough, one finds [10]\nthat X \u221e (equivalently, Teff ) is independent of it only if\nthe fluctuations in the system are of Gaussian nature (as\nin mean-field or spherical models). This observation might\nbe of relevance to the case of more complex glassy systems.\nIn addition to the case illustrated in this Section, a\nvariety of different universality classes and dynamics, both\nin the bulk and close to surfaces of semi-infinite systems\nhave been investigated in the literature [21,11].\n\n3 Relaxation in confined geometries\nIn Section 2 we discussed some aspects of critical relaxation in bulk systems, with particular focus on the nonequilibrium character of such a dynamics and on quantitative predictions for the Ising universality class with\npurely relaxational dynamics. In this Section we consider,\ninstead, relaxation phenomena in confined geometries, focussing on fluctuation-induced forces and on the way they\nbuild up in time after a thermal quench. Perhaps, the most\nwidely known example of such forces is the Casimir effect\nin quantum electrodynamics (QED) [22]; less known is\nthe analogous effect which occurs in statistical physics,\ndiscussed for the first time by Fisher and de Gennes [23].\nIndeed, whenever one confines a medium in which fluctuations (of different physical nature) take place, effective\nforces arise on the confining walls. The medium can be\nconstitued by, e.g., 4 He, 4 He/3 He mixtures, classical binary mixtures, a Bose gas or even a magnetic material.\nAt variance with QED, in statistical physics such effective\nforces have generically a finite range which is related to the\ntypical correlation length \u03be of the confined fluctuations.\nWhen this correlation length becomes much larger than\nthe typical microscopic length scale lmicr in the system,\nthe Casimir-like force FC acting on the confining walls\ntakes a universal form\nkB T\nFC\n(8)\n= d \u03b8(L/\u03be),\nA\nL\nwhere A is the large transverse area of the d\u22121-dimensional\nwalls, assumed to be parallel and separated by a distance\nL. \u03b8 is a universal scaling function and therefore it is actually determined by the gross features of: (i) the system\nin the bulk and of the fluctuating order parameter, as\nmentioned in the Introduction, (ii) the gross features of\nthe surfaces, which \u2013 to some extent \u2013 are summarized\nby the boundary conditions they impose on the order\nparameter \u03c6(x, t) (see, e.g., Ref. [24] for a review) and\n(iii) the geometry of the boundaries. In what follows we\nshall focus on the case of parallel and infinite confining\nwalls, i.e., on the film geometry. Due to universality, any\nminimal model with the same gross features as the confined systems we are interested in captures its universal\nbehaviour, including the Casimir force FC . This model\nis usually specified in terms of an effective Hamiltonian\nH[\u03c6] which determines the equilibrium distribution function Peq [\u03c6] \u221d exp{\u2212H[\u03c6]/(kB T )} of the order parameter\nand therefore the effective free energy F of the model. In\nturn, close to the bulk critical temperature Tc and for a system large enough (i.e., L \u226b lmicr), F decomposes as the\nsum of a bulk term proportional to the volume V = A \u00d7 L\nof the system, one proportional to its surface area A and a\nthird one which yields the leading and universal finite-size\ncorrection we are interested in:\nF =kB Tc A\u00d7\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(9)\n1\nLfbulk(T ) + fsurf (T ) + d\u22121 \u0398(L/\u03be) + . . . ,\nL\nwhere higher-order terms in L\u2212(d\u22121) \u00d7(lmicr/L) have been\nneglected.

The solid lines correspond to different Pad\u00e9 approximants of the two- (a) and one-loop (b) series obtained via the fieldtheoretical dimensional expansion [19,14].

The actual agreement\nbetween analytical predictions and numerical results is quite good.\n\nforce F = \u2212\u03b4F /\u03b4L acting on the confining walls is the\nsum of a bulk term Fbulk and the Casimir force FC which\nis actually the force acting on the confining walls of the\nfilm when they are \"immersed\" in the fluctuating medium\n(so that the contribution Fbulk acting on the two opposite\nsides of each wall cancels, see Fig. 4).

Summing up, the equilibrium value\nof FC can be determined via both the free energy F and\nthe stress tensor T\u03b1\u03b2 (x). On the other hand, if one is interested in relaxation phenomena the definition via F is\nno longer viable. Before discussing this point let us illustrate a simple experimentally relevant setting in which the\nrelaxation of FC might be observed. Indeed, consider the\ncase in which the Casimir force, in competition with dispersion forces, determines the equilibrium thickness L of\na wetting layer of a binary 3 He/4 He mixture at a given\ntemperature T (see, e.g., Refs. [26,27]), as in Fig. 5(a).\n\nbulk\n\nL\nLfin\n\nL\nFig. 4. Fluctuation-induced forces acting on two parallel walls\nimmersed in a fluctuating medium.

A different approach which, in principle,\nprovides such an information is based on the stress tensor\nT\u03b1\u03b2 (x). T\u03b1\u03b2 (x) is a local functional of the order parameter field \u03c6(x), it is determined \u2013 in equilibrium \u2013 on the\nbasis of H, and its expectation value on the equilibrium\ndistribution function Peq yields the force\nF = kB T AhT\u22a5\u22a5 (x)ieq ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere T\u22a5\u22a5 is a suitable component of the stress tensor T\u03b1\u03b2\n(see Ref. [25] for details). In equilibrium such an average\nis actually independent of the position x at which it is\ncalculated; nonetheless it is tempting to interpret T\u22a5\u22a5 (x)\n\nLin\n0\nTin 7\u2192 Tfin\n\nt\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 5.

Upon changing suddenly\nthe temperature (and therefore the correlation length \u03be of\nthe concentration fluctuations in the mixture) the Casimir\nforce FC changes and the thickness of the layer relaxes towards its final value (as sketched in Fig. 5(b)). Although\nexperimental data for the evolution of L are not currently\n\n\f6\n\nAndrea Gambassi: Relaxation phenomena at criticality\nd\n\nd\n\n\u223c t\u0302\u2212 2\n\nD\n\n\u223c t\u0302\u2212 2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nDD\nd\n\n\u03b8R (t\u0302)\n\u03b8R (\u221e)\n\nNN\n\n\u223c t\u0302\u2212\n\nd\u22121\n2\n\n\u03b8R (t\u0302)\n\u03b8R (\u221e)\n\nd=3\n\n0\n1\n\nd=3\nDN\n0\n\nt\u0302\n0\n\n\u223c t\u0302\u2212 2\n\nN\n\n2\n\nt\u0302\n0\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 6.

(13)) in the Gaussian model with purely relaxational dynamics. The finite-size scaling variable\nassociated with time is t\u0302 = (t/\u03c4R )(\u03be0 /L)z . The scaling function \u03b8R has been normalized by its asymptotic (equilibrium) value\n\u03b8R (t\u0302 \u2192 \u221e) (see Eq. (12)). (a) \u03b8R (t\u0302) for symmetric boundary conditions (DD and NN), leading to an attractive Casimir force\nwhich is equal on both the confining walls. (b) \u03b8R (t\u0302) for the case in which the walls impose different boundary conditions on the\norder parameter (DN or ND). In contrast to equilibrium, the dynamic value and the qualitative features of the time dependence\nof FC depend on the boundary condition imposed by the wall at which FC is measured.\n\navailable, some aspects of the dynamics of fluctuationinduced forces are expected to be accessible in the near future. The evolution of L is coupled to that one of the order\nparameter field (and other relevant hydrodynamic quantities) which evolves in time under the effect of thermal\nfluctuations; in turn, due to universality, this dynamics\ncan be studied, close to critical points, via simplified models (typically in the form of Langevin evolution equations\nfor the order parameter), as already mentioned in Sect. 2\n(see Ref. [2] for review). Instead of discussing the problem\nwithin the experimental setup described above, in which\nL changes in time, we assume that the fluctuating medium\nis confined between two parallel walls at fixed distance L\nwhile the force FC (t) acting on them is measured (Fig. 4).\nAs in the case of static behaviour, the presence of the\nconfining walls imposes boundary conditions on the timedependent order parameter field \u03c6(x, t), the dynamics of\nwhich is affected by the confinement. In order to determine\nthe dynamics of the Casimir force one has to understand\nhow the local order parameter translates into the local\nforce which can be measured, say, at the walls. One natural\nconnection between the two is provided by the local stress\nwhich, via the time-dependence of the order parameter,\nbecomes time dependent: T\u03b1\u03b2 (x, t) \u2261 T\u03b1\u03b2 |\u03c6(x)7\u2192\u03c6(x,t) . Accordingly, it is natural to define the dynamic force acting\non the walls W as [28] (compare with Eq. (10))\nF (t) \u2261 kB T AhT\u22a5\u22a5 (x \u2208 W, t)inoise\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the average h. . .inoise is taken over the possible realization of the thermal noise. Heuristically, this amounts to\nthe assumption that at each time there is an \"energy cost\"\nkB T A\u03b4LhT\u22a5\u22a5i associated with the displacement \u03b4L of one\nof the confining wall, which is actually determined, as in\nequilibrium, by the order parameter field. Note that in\nthermal equilibrium this definition renders the static force.\n(See Ref. [29] for some proposed definitions of fluctuationinduced forces in different non-equilibrium system.) At\n\nvariance with the equilibrium case, however, the local pressure F/A might actually depend on the point x at which\nit is measured. In what follows we assume translational\ninvariance in the direction parallel to the walls, yielding\na spatially constant F on each of them. Finally, in order to obtain the dynamic Casimir force FC (t) one has to\nsubtract from F (t) the corresponding bulk contribution\nFbulk (t) = limL\u2192\u221e F (t). To see this definition at work\nwe consider the case in which Tin \u226b Tc , corresponding\nto a correlation length so small that each of the walls\ncannot feel the effect of the confinement imposed by the\nother, resulting in FC (t < 0) = 0. For the final temperature, instead, we assume Tfin = Tc , which eventually leads to a non-vanishing, long-ranged Casimir force\nFC (t > 0) 6= 0. (Note that, due to the critical-point shift\nin the film geometry [30], Tc is not the critical temperature\nof the film.) The analytic results illustrated below refer to\nthe case in which the confining walls impose Dirichlet (D:\n\u03c6(x \u2208 W, t) = 0) or Neumann (N: \u2202\u22a5 \u03c6(x \u2208 W, t) = 0\nwhere \u2202\u22a5 is the derivative in the direction normal to the\nwall) boundary conditions onto the order parameter field\n\u03c6. We assume that the effective Hamiltonian H which captures the equilibrium properties of the system is quadratic\nin the order parameter (Gaussian model) and that the dynamics is purely dissipative (Model A). (We point out,\nhowever, that the actual dynamic of fluids and binary\nmixtures requires accounting for features which are not\npresent in Model A [2]). As a consequence of the quadratic\nHamiltonian, the relevant component of the stress tensor\ncan be expressed, in terms of the order parameter field, as\nT\u22a5\u22a5 (x, t) = (\u2202\u22a5 \u03c6(x, t))2 /2 \u2212 (\u2207k \u03c6(x, t))2 /2 where \u2207k is\nthe gradient parallel to the wall.\n\nIn the long-time limit the film attains equilibrium and\nthe force takes different values depending on the combination of boundary conditions imposed by the two confining\n\n\fAndrea Gambassi: Relaxation phenomena at criticality\n\n7\n\nwalls:\nkB Tc\nFC\n\u00d7\n=\nA\nLd\n\n(\n\n(s)\n\n\u2206d\n\n< 0, for DD, NN,\n\n(ns)\n\u2206d\n\n> 0, for DN, ND,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere, in three dimensions d = 3, the amplitudes for\nsymmetric and non-symmetric boundary conditions are\n(s)\n(ns)\n\u22063 = \u22120.048 . . . and \u22063\n= +0.036 . . ., respectively\n(see, e.g., Ref. [25]). According to Eq. (12), the Casimir\nforce leads to attraction between the confining walls if they\nimpose the same boundary conditions on the fluctuating\norder parameter (NN, DD), whereas repulsion results from\ndifferent boundary conditions (DN, ND). Note that in the\nlatter case the equilibrium force FC acting on the two\nwalls is the same, independently of the fact that they impose different boundary conditions on the field; in this\nsense they cannot be distinguished by measuring FC .\nIn view of dynamical scaling, the relaxation of the force\nacting on the confining walls after the thermal quench is\nexpected to depend on the temporal scaling variable t\u0302 =\n(t/\u03c40 )(\u03be0 /L)z via the dynamical scaling function \u03b8R (t\u0302),\n\u0012 \u0013z\nFC (t)\nt \u03be0\nkB Tc\n),\n(13)\n\u03b8R (t\u0302 =\n=\nA\nLd\n\u03c40 L\nwhere z = 2 is the dynamical exponent of the model we\nare focussing on. At small and large times we recover the\ninitial vanishing force and its final equilibrium value in\nEq.

In Fig. 6 we report the analytic predictions for\n\u03b8R (t\u0302) (normalized to the corresponding equilibrium value\n\u03b8R (t\u0302 \u2192 \u221e)) for the case of symmetric DD, NN (a) and\nnon-symmetric DN, ND (b) boundary conditions. The approach to the asymptotic value depends on the boundary\nconditions but whereas in (a) it is independent of the wall\nat which FC is measured (due to the symmetry), this is\nno longer the case in (b). Accordingly, the dynamics of FC\nprovides a way of determining which one of the two walls\nimposes D or N boundary condition in the DN (or ND)\ncase, even though this is not possible by simply looking\nat the equilibrium force. Interestingly enough, the time\ndependence is not monotonic in the case of the D wall.\nThe definition (11) allows one to study the effect of an\nexternal perturbation on the Casimir force acting on the\nconfining walls, as discussed in detail in Ref. [28] within\nthe present model and DD boundary conditions. In particular, if the external field (conjugate to the order parameter) is localized in time and space, as indicated by\nthe black dot in the side view in Fig. 7(a), the response\nstarts to propagate in the film, yielding asymmetric effects. At the very early stages, the response has practically\nnot yet reached the confining walls so that the force acting\non them is basically the equilibrium one corresponding to\na vanishing external field. In course of time the perturbation induced by the field hits the confining walls and\ncorrespondigly the force exerted on them increases (reducing the equilibrium attraction), with different magnitude at different points. Finally, because of the relaxation\n\nL\n\nx\n\n0\n\nL=3\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 7. Effect of an external field on the Casimir force acting on the confining walls. The impulse field is applied at time\nt\u0302 = 0 and distance L/3 from the left wall (a). The response of\nthe medium is such that the Casimir force locally increses compared to its (negative) equilibrium value, reaches a maximum\nand then, due to the relaxational character of the dynamics,\ndecreases again to its equilibrium value. The spatial dependence of the total local force at time t\u0302 = 0.096 for the critical\nGaussian model with DD boundary conditions is sketched in\n(b), where the colorcode indicates increasing force from bottom\nto top, compared to the equilibrium value. The magnitude of\nthe field-induced effect depends on the square of the strength\nof the applied perturbation (see Ref. [28] for details).\n\ncharacter of the dynamics, the perturbation induced by\nthe external field vanishes in the limit of long times and\nthe effective force reaches again its equilibrium value. In\nFig. 7(b) we report a sketch of the distribution of the resulting stess on the confining wall at time t\u0302 = 0.096 in\nthe case in which the impulse has been applied at time\nt\u0302 = 0 in the position indicated in Fig. 7(a). The system is\nassumed to be at the bulk critical temperature Tc . Due to\nthe different distances from the two walls, the maximum\nforce for x = 0 is attained earlier on the left wall compared to the right one. (We refer the reader to Ref. [28]\nfor further details.)\nIn summary, we have proposed a definition of the dynamic Casimir force FC via the local and time-dependent\nstress tensor T\u03b1\u03b2 (see Eq. (11)), which allows one to study\nthe equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of FC in a\nvariety of different cases, dynamics and boundary conditions. The analysis of very simple models reveals already\na quite rich behaviour. However, it is desirable to establish a clearer connection between this definition of the dynamic Casimir force and the force that can be measured\ndirectly in actual experiments and molecular dynamics\nsimulations.\n\n4 Perspectives\nIn the previous Sections we have reviewed some aspects\nof relaxation phenomena in bulk and confined critical systems.
