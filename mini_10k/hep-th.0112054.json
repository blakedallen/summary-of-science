Introduction\nA collection of branes may (under some circumstances) find it energetically favourable\nto expand to form a brane of higher dimension [1, 2]. This 'brane expansion' plays a\nfundamental role in a number of phenomena, such as the behaviour of gravitons at high\nenergies in certain backgrounds [3] or the string realization of the vacuum structure of\nN =1 four-dimensional gauge theories [4]. The presence of the new brane 'created' by\nthe expansion is implied by the fact that the expanded system couples locally to higherrank gauge fields under which the original constituents are neutral1 . For a large number\nof constituent branes there may then be an effective description in terms of the higherdimensional brane in which the original branes have become fluxes of various types.\n1\n\nThis feature is absent from a phenomenon such as the enhan\u00e7on [5] which some authors also refer\nto as 'brane expansion'.\n\n1\n\n\fSince no net higher-dimensional brane charge is created by the process of expansion,\nat least one of the dimensions of the higher-dimensional brane must be compact and\nhomologically trivial.\nAlthough the phenomenon of brane expansion was originally discovered in the\ncontext of supersymmetric theories, early examples of 'expanded-brane' configurations\nwere not themselves supersymmetric, and hence unlikely to be stable. Supersymmetric\nexpanded brane configurations in certain backgrounds have been found2 but the presence of non-vanishing Ramond-Ramond fields in all of them makes any conventional\nstring theory analysis difficult. At present, the only example of a supersymmetric expanded brane configuration in a vacuum background is the D2-brane 'supertube' of [6],\nwhich was provided with a Matrix Theory interpretation in [7]. Supertubes are collections of type IIA fundamental strings and D0-branes which have been expanded, in the\nIIA Minkowski vacuum, to tubular 1/4-supersymmetric D2-branes by the addition of\nangular momentum3 .\nThe simplest potential instability of any expanded brane configuration is that\ncaused by brane tension, which tends to force the system to contract. The presence or\nabsence of this instability is captured by the low-energy effective action for the brane in\nquestion, e.g. the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action for D-branes. The D2-brane DBI action is what was used in [6] to find the D2-brane supertube (with circular cross-section)\nand to establish its supersymmetry. Although the original supertube was assumed to\nhave a circular cross-section, it was shown in [9], in the Matrix Theory context, that an\nelliptical cross-section is also possible. One purpose of this paper is to generalize the\nresults of [6] to show that 1/4-supersymmetric supertubes may have as a cross-section a\ncompletely arbitrary curve in E8 . The stability of the original supertube was attributed\nto the angular momentum generated by the Born-Infeld (BI) fields. Although this is\nstill true, the stability of the general supertube configurations is less easily understood;\nas we shall see the D2-brane tension is not isotropic and the supertube behaves in some\nrespects like a tensionless brane. We also find these general supertube configurations as\nsolutions of the light-front gauge-fixed eleven-dimensional supermembrane equations.\nAs this is the N = \u221e limit of the Matrix model, we thus make contact with the Matrix\nTheory approach of [7, 9].\nA second potential instability is that associated to the long-range forces between\ndifferent regions of an expanded brane (or between different expanded branes) due\nto the exchange of massless particles. In the case of the D2-brane supertube these\n2\n\nFor example (but not exclusively) in AdS backgrounds [3, 4]. We thank Iosif Bena for correspondence on this point.\n3\nNon-supersymmetric brane expansion by angular momentum in Minkowski space was considered\npreviously in [8].\n\n2\n\n\fare particles in the closed IIA superstring spectrum. Whether or not this instability\noccurs may be determined by considering the D2-brane supertube in the context of the\neffective IIA supergravity theory. For circular supertubes this aspect was considered in\n[10], where a 1/4-supersymmetric supergravity solution for a general multi-supertube\nsystem was constructed and stability against supergravity forces confirmed4 . Here we\nshall generalize these results to supertubes with arbitrary cross-section by explicitly\nexhibiting the corresponding supergravity solutions.\nIn the case of D-branes (at least) there is a third more dramatic and purely 'stringy'\npotential instability of an expanded brane configuration arising from the fact that opposite sides (along one of the compact directions) of the (higher-dimensional) D-brane\nbehave locally as a brane/anti-brane pair. For sufficiently small separation there are\ntachyons in the open strings between a D-brane and an anti-D-brane, so a sufficiently\ncompact expanded D-brane configuration is potentially unstable against tachyon condensation [11]. One purpose of this paper is to examine this issue for the D2-brane\nsupertube. One would certainly expect it to be stable given that it preserves supersymmetry, but supersymmetry has been established only within the context of the effective\nDBI action and the effective supergravity theory. Thus the preservation of supersymmetry could be an artifact of these effective theories that is not reproduced within the\nfull string theory; the stability of the supertube in the full IIA string theory is therefore\nnot guaranteed a priori.\nThe main obstacle to a full string theory analysis of the supertube is that, as for\nany other expanded brane configuration, the D-brane surface must be (extrinsically)\ncurved, so even though we have the advantage of a vacuum spacetime background the\nquantization of open strings attached to the D2-brane supertube is a difficult problem.\nHowever, it seems reasonable to suppose that any tachyons in the supertube system\nwould also appear in the case in which the D2-brane is locally approximated by a flat\n'tangent-brane'. In fact, because the cross-section of the supertube is arbitrary we may\ntake a limiting case in which the tube becomes a pair of D2-branes which intersect at an\narbitrary angle \u03c6; the particular case \u03c6 = \u03c0 corresponds to a parallel D2/anti-D2 pair,\ndiscussed in [9] in the Matrix model context. Another purpose of this paper is to show\nthat there is no tachyon in this system for any angle. We establish this by computing\nthe one-loop vacuum energy of the open strings stretched between the D2-branes.\n\n2. Supertubes with Arbitrary Cross-sections\nIn the original paper on supertubes [6] only circular cross-sections were considered. This\n4\n\nMulti-supertube systems have been considered in the context of Matrix Theory in [7].\n\n3\n\n\fwas later generalized in the context of Matrix theory [9] to elliptical cross-sections. The\npurpose of this section is to show that any tubular D2-brane with an arbitrary crosssection (not necessarily contained in a 2-plane nor closed) carrying the appropriate\nstring and D0-brane charges is also 1/4-supersymmetric. This point is not immediately\nobvious from the approach in [9] and it was missed in the DBI analysis of [6].\n2.1 Supersymmetry\nConsider a D2-brane with worldvolume coordinates \u03be a = {t, z, \u03c3} in the type IIA\nMinkowski vacuum. We write the spacetime metric as\nds210 = \u2212dT 2 + dZ 2 + dY~ * dY~ ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere Y~ = {Y i } are Cartesian coordinates on E8 , and set\nT = t,\n\nZ = z,\n\nY~ = ~y (\u03c3) .\n\n(2.2)\n\nThis describes a static tubular D2-brane whose axis is aligned with the Z-direction and\nwhose cross-section is an arbitrary curve ~y (\u03c3) in E8 (see Figure 1). Although the term\n'tubular' is strictly appropriate only when the curve is closed, we will use it to refer to\nany of these configurations.\n\nZ\n\nY8\n\nY = y( \u03c3 )\nY1\nY2\n\n~ = ~y (\u03c3) in E8 .\nFigure 1: Supertube with arbitrary cross-section Y\n\nWe will also allow for time- and z-independent electric (in the Z-direction) and\nmagnetic fields, so the BI field-strength on the D2-brane is\nF = E dt \u2227 dz + B(\u03c3) dz \u2227 d\u03c3 .\n\n4\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fAs we will see in more detail below, this corresponds to having string charge in the\nZ-direction and D0-brane charge dissolved in the D2-brane. Note that, under the\nassumption of time- and z-independence, closure of F implies that E must be constant\nbut still allows B to depend on \u03c3.\nThe supersymmetries of the IIA Minkowski vacuum preserved by a D2-brane configuration are those generated by (constant) Killing spinors \u01eb satisfying \u0393\u01eb = \u01eb, where\n\u0393 is the matrix appearing in the 'kappa-symmetry' transformation of the D2-brane\nworldvolume spinors [12]. For the configuration of interest here this condition reduces\nto\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\nyi\u2032 \u0393i \u0393\u266e (\u0393T Z \u0393\u266e + E) \u01eb + B \u0393T \u0393\u266e \u2212 (1 \u2212 E 2 )|~y \u2032 |2 + B 2 \u01eb = 0 ,\n(2.4)\n\nwhere \u0393T , \u0393Z and \u0393i are (constant) ten-dimensional Minkowski spacetime Dirac matrices, \u0393\u266e = \u0393T \u0393Z \u03931 . . . \u03938 is the chirality matrix in ten dimensions, and the prime denotes\ndifferentiation with respect to \u03c3.\nThe supersymmetry preservation equation (2.4) is satisfied for any arbitrary curve\nprovided that we set |E| = 1, impose the two conditions\n\u0393T Z \u0393\u266e \u01eb = \u2212sgn(E) \u01eb ,\n\n\u0393T \u0393\u266e \u01eb = sgn(B) \u01eb\n\n(2.5)\n\non the Killing spinors, and demand that B(\u03c3) is a constant-sign, but otherwise completely arbitrary, function of \u03c3. We would like to emphasize that |E| = 1 is not a\ncritical electric field in the presence of a nowhere-vanishing magnetic field B(\u03c3), which\nis the only case that we will consider in this paper.\nThe two conditions (2.5) on \u01eb correspond to string charge along the Z-direction\nand to D0-brane charge, respectively, and preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry5 . Note\nthat the D2-brane projector does not appear; we shall return to this issue later. It\nis straightforward to check that this configuration satisfies the equations of motion\nderived from the D2-brane action, which (for unit surface tension) is\nZ\nZ\np\nSD2 = dt dz d\u03c3 LD2 = \u2212 dt dz d\u03c3 \u2212 det(g + F ) ,\n(2.6)\nwhere\n\nds2 (g) = \u2212dt2 + dz 2 + |~y \u2032 |2 d\u03c3 2\n\n(2.7)\n\nis the induced metric on the D2-brane worldvolume. Note that the area element is\np\ndet gspatial = |~y \u2032 | .\n(2.8)\n5\n\nThe equation (2.4) admits other types of solutions for particular forms of the cross-section. For\nexample, if this is a straight line and B is constant, then the fraction of preserved supersymmetry is\n1/2, corresponding to an infinite planar D2-brane with a homogeneous density of bound strings and\nD0-branes. In this paper we will concentrate on the generic case of an arbitrary cross-section.\n\n5\n\n\f2.2 Mechanical Stability: Momentum versus Tension\nWe have concluded that a D2-brane with an arbitrary shape and an arbitrary magnetic\nfield B(\u03c3) preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetries of the IIA vacuum, and therefore\nmust be stable. In 'normal' circumstances this would be impossible because of the D2brane tension. In the present case this tension is exactly balanced by the 'centrifugal'\nforce associated to the linear momentum density carried by the supertube, as we show\nbelow. The origin of this momentum is not time-dependence (which would generically\nbe incompatible with supersymmetry) but the Poynting vector generated by the crossed\nstatic electric and magnetic fields on the D2-brane.\nThe linear momentum density in the i-direction is easily computed by momentarily\nallowing Y i to depend on time, evaluating\nPi =\n\n\u2202LD2\n,\n\u2202 \u1e8e i\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere the dot denotes differentiation with respect to time, and finally setting \u1e8e i = 0.\nThe result is\nBEyi\u2032\nPi = p\n.\n(2.10)\n(1 \u2212 E 2 )|~y \u2032 |2 + B 2\nSimilarly, the momentum conjugate to the electric field or 'electric displacement' is\n\u03a0(\u03c3) =\n\nE|~y \u2032 |2\n\u2202LD2\n.\n=p\n\u2202E\n(1 \u2212 E 2 )|~y \u2032 |2 + B 2\n\n(2.11)\n\nFor supersymmetric configurations |E| = 1 and the momenta (2.10) become\nP i = sgn(\u03a0B) yi\u2032 .\n\n(2.12)\n\nThis combined with (2.11) yields the condition\n~ 2 = |\u03a0B| .\n|P|\n\n(2.13)\n\nNote that the densities \u03a0(\u03c3), B(\u03c3) and P i (\u03c3) depend on the parametrization of the\ncurve ~y (\u03c3). However, the physical densities per unit D2-brane area are reparametrizationinvariant. Using (2.8) these are\n\u03a0ph (\u03c3) =\n\n\u03a0(\u03c3)\n,\n|~y \u2032 |\n\nBph (\u03c3) =\n\nB(\u03c3)\n,\n|~y \u2032 |\n\nP iph (\u03c3) =\n\nP i (\u03c3)\n.\n|~y \u2032 |\n\n(2.14)\n\nNote that, by virtue of (2.12), the momentum density per unit area has constant unit\n~ ph | = 1.\nmagnitude, that is, |P\n\n6\n\n\fThe stability of the supertube with an arbitrary shape may now be understood in\n'mechanical' terms as follows. The conserved string charge and the D0-brane charge\nper unit length in the Z-direction carried by the supertube are (for an appropriate\nchoice of units)\nZ\nZ\nqF 1 =\n\nd\u03c3 \u03a0 ,\n\nqD0 =\n\nd\u03c3 B .\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe string and D0-brane charge densities \u03a0(\u03c3) and B(\u03c3) generate a Poynting linear\n~ at each point along the cross-section. For specified shape and\nmomentum density P\nmagnetic field B, supersymmetry automatically adjusts \u03a0 in such a way that the momentum density per unit area is tangent to the curve and has constant magnitude.\nThe fact that it is tangent means that, in a mechanical analogy, one can think of this\nmomentum as originating from a continuous motion of the curve along itself, similarly\nto that of a fluid along a tube of fixed shape. The fact that it is constant in magnitude means that the force acting on each point of the curve must be orthogonal to the\nmomentum: this is precisely the force due to the D2-brane tension. In the absence\nof momentum, this tension would make the curve collapse, whereas here it provides\nprecisely the required centripetal force to direct the motion of each point on the curve\nin such a way that the curve is mapped into itself under this motion. This is how\nstability is achieved for an arbitrary shape.\nOne consequence of the precise balance of forces discussed above is that the D2brane behaves in a certain sense as a tensionless brane. To see this, it is important to\nremember that the tension of a system is not the same as its energy per unit volume,\nand also that it may be non-isotropic; the supertube is an example of this. The tension\ntensor is defined as minus the purely spatial part of the spacetime stress-energy tensor.\nThe latter is computed as\nT M N (x) = \u221a\n\n2\n\u03b4SD2\n\u2212 det G \u03b4GM N (x)\n\n(M, N = 0, . . . , 9)\n\n(2.16)\n\nGM N =\u03b7M N\n\nby momentarily allowing for a general spacetime metric in the D2-brane action and\nthen setting it to its Minkowski value (2.1) after evaluating the variation above. The\nresult is\nZ\nMN\nT\n(x) = d3 \u03be T M N (X(\u03be)) \u03b4 (10) (x \u2212 X(\u03be)) ,\n(2.17)\n\nwhere\n\np\n\u0002\n\u0003(ab)\nT M N = \u2212 \u2212 det(g + F ) (g + F )\u22121\n\u2202a X M \u2202b X N\n\n(2.18)\n\nand X M = {T, Z, Y i }. Note that T M N (x) is conserved, that is, \u2202M T M N = 0, by virtue\nof the D2-brane equations of motion\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n\u0002\n\u0003ab\n(2.19)\ndet(g + F ) (g + F )\u22121 \u2202b X M = 0 .\n\u2202a\n7\n\n\fSpecializing to the supertube configurations of interest here we find that the only nonzero components of T M N are\nT T T = |\u03a0| + |B| ,\n\nT ZZ = \u2212|\u03a0| ,\n\nT T i = sgn(\u03a0B) yi\u2032 .\n\n(2.20)\n\nThis result illustrates a number of points. First, the off-diagonal components T T i\nare precisely the linear momentum density (2.12) carried by the tube, as expected.\nSecond, the fact that T ij vanishes identically means that there is no tension along the\ncross-section; this provides a more formal explanation of why an arbitrary shape is\nstable. Third, the tube tension \u2212T ZZ = |\u03a0| in the Z-direction is only due to the string\ndensity. Hence the D2-brane does not contribute to the tension in any direction: it has\neffectively become tensionless. (The fact that the D0-branes do not contribute to the\ntension either should be expected: they behave like dust.) Finally, the net energy of\nthe supertube per unit length in the Z-direction\nZ\nH = d\u03c3 T T T = |qF 1| + |qD0 |\n(2.21)\nsaturates the lower bound which we will derive from the supersymmetry algebra below.\nIn particular, it receives contributions from the strings and the D0-branes, but not\nfrom the D2-brane. The reason for this is that the supertube is a true bound state\nin which the strictly negative energy which binds the strings and D0-branes to the\nD2-brane is exactly cancelled by the strictly positive energies associated to the mass of\nthe D2-brane and to the presence of a linear momentum density.\n2.3 Central Charges\nSupersymmetric configurations in a given theory are those which minimize the energy\nfor fixed values of the central charges in the supersymmetry algebra of the theory. Both\nthis energy and the precise set of preserved supersymmetries are completely determined\nonce the central charges are specified. For the type IIA theory, the anti-commutator of\ntwo supercharges in the presence of the central charges Z of interest here is\n1\nT M\nF1\nT\nD0\n{Q, Q} = \u0393T \u0393M PM + \u0393T \u0393M N Z D2\n.\nM N + \u0393 \u0393 \u0393\u266e Z M + \u0393 \u0393\u266e Z\n2\n\n(2.22)\n\nIn the previous sections we have understood the supersymmetries preserved by the\nsupertube and its mechanical stability from a local analysis. One purpose of this\nsection is to show that this also follows from consideration of the central charges in\nthe algebra above carried by the supertube. We shall also prove the existence of upper\nbounds on the total angular momentum and on the linear momentum density.\n\n8\n\n\fBy definition, any supertube carries non-zero string and D0-brane charges. In\naddition, it may carry a total (per unit length in the Z-direction) linear momentum Pi\nand/or angular momentum 2-form Lij = \u2212Lji in E8 . These are obtained by integrating\nthe corresponding densities along the cross-section. For N overlapping D2-branes the\nlinear momentum density (2.12) for supersymmetric configurations becomes\nP i = N yi\u2032 ,\n\n(2.23)\n\n(where we have chosen sgn(\u03a0B) = +1 for concreteness) and hence the total linear\nmomentum is\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\nPi = N\nd\u03c3 yi = N\ndyi .\n(2.24)\nNote that the momentum density per unit area has magnitude N, that is,\n~ ph | = N .\n|P\n\n(2.25)\n\nSimilarly, the angular momentum density is\nLij \u2261 Yi P j \u2212 Yj P i ,\nso in the supersymmetric case the total angular momentum takes the form\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\nLij = N\nd\u03c3 yi yj \u2212 yj yi = N\n(yi dyj \u2212 yj dyi ) .\n\n(2.26)\n\n(2.27)\n\nConsider now a supertube with a closed cross-section. In this case the angular\nmomentum in a given ij-plane is precisely the number of D2-branes times twice the\narea of the region A enclosed by the projection C of the cross-section onto that plane,\nsince by Stoke's theorem we have\nI\nZ\nLij = N\n(yi dyj \u2212 yj dyi ) = 2N\ndyi \u2227 dyj .\n(2.28)\nC\nA\nConsequently, a non-zero angular momentum prevents a closed cross-section from collapse, since the area enclosed by a collapsed cross-section would vanish. A closed\nsupertube is therefore stabilized by the angular momentum. It may appear surprising that this can be done supersymmetrically in the Minkowski vacuum, since angular\nmomentum is not a central charge in Minkowski supersymmetry6 . There is no contradiction, however, because the set of preserved supersymmetries and the energy of a\n6\n\nThis should be contrasted with the case of AdS supersymmetry, for which the angular momentum\nis one of the central charges. Presumably, this is related to the supersymmetry of the giant gravitons\n[3].\n\n9\n\n\fclosed supertube are independent of the angular momentum. In fact, they are precisely\nthe same as those of a supersymmetric collection of strings and D0-branes (see (2.5)\nand (2.21)). This follows from the supersymmetry algebra because both systems carry\nthe same central charges: for a closed supertube, the total linear momentum (2.24)\nvanishes because in this case yi (\u03c3) are periodic, and the net D2-brane charge vanishes\nbecause one of the D2-brane directions is compact.\nThe case of a supertube with an open cross-section which extends asymptotically\nto infinity7 is more subtle, because in this case there is both a total linear momentum\nand a net D2-brane charge. Nevertheless, the supersymmetry algebra still implies\nthe same bound on the energy and the same supersymmetry conditions because of a\n'cancellation' between the momentum and the D2-brane charge in the supersymmetry\nalgebra. Indeed, preserved supersymmetries correspond to eigen-spinors \u01eb of the matrix\nin (2.22) with zero eigen-value. Specifying to a supertube with cross-section extending\nasymptotically along a direction denoted by k equation (2.22) becomes\n{Q, Q} = P 0 + N\u0393T \u0393k (1 \u2212 \u0393Z ) + \u0393T Z \u0393\u266e Z F 1 + \u0393T \u0393\u266e Z D0 ,\n\n(2.29)\n\nwhere we have made use of the fact that Pk = N (see (2.25)) and that Z D2\nzk = N. Now it\nis clear that if we impose the conditions (2.5) on \u01eb then the term in brackets originating\nfrom the linear momentum and the D2-brane charge automatically vanishes, and that\nin order for \u01eb to have zero eigen-value we must have\nP 0 = |Z F 1 | + |Z D0 | .\n\n(2.30)\n\nThis is essentially the integrated (in the Z-direction) version of equation (2.21), and\nthe usual arguments show that the right-hand side is a lower bound on the energy of\nany configuration with the same charges.\nWe now turn to the upper bound on the angular momentum. For simplicity, here\nwe restrict ourselves to closed supertubes. We choose the parametrization such that\n~y (\u03c3) = ~y (\u03c3 + 1), so that the angular momentum 2-form per period is\nLij = N\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u0001\nd\u03c3 yi yj\u2032 \u2212 yj yi\u2032 .\n\nThe total angular momentum J is defined as\nr\n1\nJ\u2261\nLij Lij ,\n2\n7\n\n(2.31)\n\n(2.32)\n\nThis must indeed be the case for a non-closed curve, since by charge conservation a D2-brane\ncannot have a boundary unless it ends on another appropriate brane.\n\n10\n\n\fand satisfies the bound8\nJ \u2264 N \u22121 |qF 1 qD0 | .\n\n(2.33)\n\nTo see this, we assume (without loss of generality) that the E8 axes are oriented such\nthat the angular momentum 2-form L is skew-diagonal with skew-eigenvalues l\u03b1 =\nL2\u03b1\u22121,2\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, . . . , 4, and that the cross-section is parametrized in pairs of polar\ncoordinates as\ny 2\u03b1\u22121 = R\u03b1 (\u03c3) sin (2\u03c0\u03c3) ,\ny 2\u03b1 = R\u03b1 (\u03c3) cos (2\u03c0\u03c3) ,\n\n(2.34)\n\nwhere R\u03b1 are four position-dependent radii.

As may\nbe seen by demanding the saturation of all the inequalities in (2.35), equality in (2.33)\nis achieved if and only if: (i) all but one of the skew-eigenvalues of L vanish, so the\n8\n\nThis bound was derived in [10] for a supertube with a circular cross-section.\n\n11\n\n\fsupertube cross-section is a curve in E2 , (ii) this curve is a circle, so the supertube is a\nperfect cylinder, and (iii) \u03a0 and B are constant, so the supertube carries homogeneous\nstring and D0-brane charge densities.\nWe finally turn to the linear momentum density. For a general 1/4-supersymmetric\n~ ph is not actually given by (2.13), but instead\ntype IIA configuration, the magnitude of P\nis only bounded from above by the right-hand-side of this equation; this observation\nis important for comparison with the supergravity description. The reason is that the\nmagnitude of the string and D0-brane charge densities at any point along the crosssection of a supertube can be increased without increasing the momentum density and\nwhile preserving supersymmetry. This is because, as discussed exhaustively in [10] for\na circular supertube and as we shall see in Section 4 for a general one, there is no force\nbetween a supertube and strings (aligned along the Z-direction) or D0-branes (with\ncharges of the same sign as those on the tube) placed at rest at arbitrary distances from\neach other; the combined system still preserves 1/4 supersymmetry. In particular, these\nextra strings and D0-branes can be superposed with the tube without being bound to\n~ intact. Thus for a general combined system\nit, hence increasing |\u03a0B| but leaving |P|\nwe conclude that\n|P|2 \u2264 |\u03a0B| .\n\n(2.36)\n\n3. Supermembrane Analysis\nWe have just seen that the cross-section of a D2-brane supertube may have an arbitrary shape. We shall now show that this result can be understood from an M-theory\nperspective via the light-front-gauge supermembrane. This analysis provides a link\nbetween the DBI approach and the Matrix model approach, used in [7] to recover the\nsupertube with circular cross-section and then generalized in [9] to a supertube with\nelliptical cross-section. The reason that the two approaches are related is that the\nD2-brane DBI action in a IIA vacuum background is equivalent to the action for the\nsupermembrane action in a background spacetime of the form E(1,9) \u00d7 S 1 ; the former\nis obtained from the latter by dualization of the scalar field that gives the position of\nthe membrane on the S 1 factor. But the supermembrane action in light-cone gauge is\na supersymmetric gauge quantum mechanics (SGQM) model with the group SDif f of\narea-preserving diffeomorphisms of the membrane as its gauge group, and this becomes\na Matrix model when SDif f is approximated by SU(N) [13]. Here we shall work\ndirectly with the SDif f model, and take the decompactification limit.\n\n12\n\n\fIn choosing the light-front gauge, one first chooses the metric\nds211\n\n+\n\n= dY dY\u2212 +\n\n9\nX\n\ndY I dY I .\n\n(3.1)\n\nI=1\n\nI\n\nThe physical worldvolume fields Y specify the position of the membrane in a 9dimensional space E9 . The bosonic light-front gauge Hamiltonian density is\n\"\n#\n1 X 2 X I J 2\n(3.2)\nP +\n{Y , Y } ,\nH=\n2 I I I<J\n\nwhere PI is the momentum space variable conjugate to Y I . The bracket {f, g} of any\ntwo functions on the membrane is the Lie bracket\n{f, g} \u2261 \u03b5ab \u2202a f \u2202b g ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere \u03c3 a (a = 1, 2) are the (arbitrary) membrane coordinates. Although the variables\n(Y I , PI ) span an 18-dimensional space, the physical bosonic phase space is only 16dimensional because of the Gauss law constraint\nX\n{Y I , PI } = 0 ,\n(3.4)\nI\n\nand the SDif f gauge transformation that the constraint function generates.\nWe begin by separating the coordinates as Y I = (Z, Y i ), where Y i are Cartesian\ncoordinates on E8 , and their corresponding conjugate momenta as PI = (PZ , Pi ).

Clearly, all of the '\u03b2-supersymmetries' are broken, and\nthe 16 components of S are the corresponding Nambu-Goldstone fermions. Setting \u03b2 to\nzero and making use of the relations (3.8) and (3.9), the supersymmetry transformation\nbecomes\n\u03b4S = Pi \u03b3i (1 \u2212 \u03b3Z ) \u03b1 ,\n(3.12)\nwhere the three Dirac matrices \u03b3 i form a reducible 16-dimensional representation of\nthe Clifford algebra for SO(8). This vanishes for parameters \u03b1 satisfying\n\u03b3Z \u03b1 = \u03b1 ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhich reduces the number of non-zero supersymmetry parameters to 8.\nLet us now study some explicit solutions of the equations (3.8) and (3.9). To make\ncontact with [7] we first concentrate on a circular cross-section of radius R (which we\ninitially allow to depend on the position along the axis of the tube) in the, say, 12-plane.\nHence we choose membrane coordinates (z, \u03c6) and set\nY 1 = R(z) cos \u03c6 ,\n\nY 2 = R(z) sin \u03c6 ,\n\n14\n\nZ =z.\n\n(3.14)\n\n\fIt now follows from (3.8) that R must be constant, in which case Y 1 , Y 2 and Z satisfy\n{Z, Y 1 } = \u2212Y 2 ,\n\n{Z, Y 2 } = Y 1 ,\n\n{Y 1 , Y 2 } = 0 ,\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhich implies that the angular momentum in the Z-direction is\nLZ = Y 1 P2 \u2212 Y 2 P1 = R2 .\n\n(3.16)\n\nIf we now replace the Poisson bracket of functions on the membrane by \u2212i times\nthe commutator of N \u00d7 N Hermitian matrices, then we recover the Matrix theory\ndescription of the supertube given in [7]. It is manifest from our derivation of this result\nthat the large N limit yields a tubular membrane with, in this case, a circular crosssection. It should be noted, however, that the identification of this 1/4-supersymmetric\ntubular membrane with the D2-brane supertube is not immediate because the latter\nlifts to a time-dependent M2-brane configuration in standard Minkowski coordinates [6].\nMoreover, there exist 1/4-supersymmetric tubular solutions of the DBI equations for\nnon-constant R(z) [6], whereas supersymmetry forces constant R in the above Matrix\nmodel approach. Thus, the equations (3.8) and (3.9) do not capture all possibilities for\nsupersymmetric tubular D2-branes. However, the method does capture the possibility\nof an arbitrary cross-section. Indeed, choose membrane coordinates (z, \u03c3) and set\nY i = y i (\u03c3) ,\n\nZ =z.\n\n(3.17)\n\nAn argument analogous to that which led to (2.12) shows that we then have\nPi = yi\u2032 .\n\n(3.18)\n\nIt is now immediate to verify that (3.17) and (3.18) solve the supersymmetry equations\n(3.8) and (3.9).\n\n4.

B2 and Cp are the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond-Ramond potentials,\nrespectively, with gauge-invariant field-strengths\nH3 = dB2 ,\n\nF2 = dC1 ,\n\nG4 = dC3 \u2212 dB2 \u2227 C1 .\n\n(4.2)\n\nNote for future reference that for the solution above\nG4 = U \u22121 V \u22121 (dT \u2212 A) \u2227 dZ \u2227 dA .\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe solution (4.1) was actually presented in [10], but there only the choice of\nU, V and A that describes a supertube with circular cross-section was found. The\ngeneralization to an N-D2-brane tube with an arbitrary cross-section in E8 specified by\nY~ = ~y (\u03c3) and carrying string and D0-brane charge densities \u03a0(\u03c3) and B(\u03c3) is\nZ\n|\u03a0(\u03c3)|\n1\n~\nd\u03c3\nU(Y ) = 1 +\n,\n(4.4)\n6\u03a97\n|Y~ \u2212 ~y (\u03c3)|6\nZ\n|B(\u03c3)|\n1\n~\nd\u03c3\nV (Y ) = 1 +\n,\n(4.5)\n6\u03a97\n|Y~ \u2212 ~y (\u03c3)|6\nZ\nyi\u2032 (\u03c3)\nN\nd\u03c3\nA(Y~ ) =\ndY i ,\n(4.6)\n6\n~\n6\u03a97\n|Y \u2212 ~y (\u03c3)|\nwhere \u03a9q is the volume of a unit q-sphere. The solution (4.1) with these choices\ncorrectly reproduces all the features of the supertube. First, it preserves the same\nsupersymmetries, since for any choice of U, V and A, the solution (4.1) is invariant\nunder eight supersymmetries generated by Killing spinors of the form (in the obvious\northonormal frame for the metric)\n\u01eb = U \u22121/4 V \u22121/8 \u01eb0 ,\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere \u01eb0 is a constant spinor which must satisfy precisely the constraints (2.5)9 [10].\nSecond, it carries all the appropriate charges. To see this, we need to distinguish\nbetween closed and open cross-sections. Suppose first that the cross-section is closed.\nIn this case we shall assume that it is contained in a compact region of E8 of finite\nsize and that the charges (2.15) and momenta (2.24) and (2.27) are finite. Under these\ncircumstances we have the following asymptotic behaviour for large |Y~ |:\nU(Y~ ) \u223c 1 +\n9\n\n|qF 1 |\n+*** ,\n6\u03a97 |Y~ |6\n\nWith sgn(E) = sgn(B) = 1; these signs are reversed by taking T \u2192 \u2212T and/or Z \u2192 \u2212Z.\n\n16\n\n\fV (Y~ ) \u223c 1 +\nA(Y~ ) \u223c\n\n|qD0 |\n+*** ,\n6\u03a97 |Y~ |6\n\nLij Y j\ndY i + * * * ,\n8\n~\n2\u03a97 |Y |\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere the dots stand for terms sub-leading in the limit under consideration and qF 1 , qD0\nand Lij are defined as in (2.15) and (2.27). This shows that the metric is asymptotically\nflat for large |Y~ |. We see from the contributions of U and V to the field-strengths H3\nand F2 that the solution carries string charge qF 1 and D0-brane charge per unit length\nin the Z-direction qD0 . Evaluation of the appropriate ADM integrals shows that it also\ncarries an energy per unit length in the Z-direction\nH = |qF 1 | + |qD0 | ,\n\n(4.9)\n\nas well as angular momentum Lij in the ij-plane. Note that there is no linear momentum, as expected for a closed curve. The field-strength (4.3) sourced by the D2-brane\ntakes the asymptotic form\n\"\n#\nLij Y j\nG4 \u223c d\n(4.10)\ndT \u2227 dZ \u2227 dY i + * * * .\n2\u03a97 |Y~ |8\nSince the integral of \u2217G4 over any 6-sphere at infinity vanishes, the solution carries\nno net D2-brane charge, as expected for a closed supertube. However, as explained in\n[10], the fact that G4 does not vanish implies that the D2-brane dipole (and higher)\nmoments are non-zero.\nConsider now an open cross-section. For simplicity we assume that outside some\ncompact region the curve becomes a straight line along the, say, Y 1 -direction, and that\nthe densities per unit area \u03a0ph (\u03c3) and Bph (\u03c3) become constants \u03a00 and B0 . Under\nthese circumstances we have the following asymptotic expansions\nU \u223c 1+\nV \u223c 1+\nA\u223c\nfor large |Y~\u22a5 |, where\n\n|\u03a00 |\n+*** ,\n5\u03a96 |Y~\u22a5 |5\n|B0 |\n+*** ,\n5\u03a96 |Y~\u22a5 |5\n\nN\ndY 1 + * * * ,\n5\n~\n5\u03a96 |Y\u22a5 |\n\nY~\u22a5 = (Y 2 , . . . , Y 8 )\n\n17\n\n(4.11)\n\n(4.12)\n\n\fis the position in the transverse directions. These expansions show that, at large\ndistances, the solution describes N infinite D2-branes that extend asymptotically along\nthe ZY 1 -plane, with strings (along the Z-direction) and D0-branes bound to them.\nIndeed, the solution is asymptotically flat at tranverse infinity, that is, for large |Y~\u22a5 |.\nFrom the asymptotic forms of H3 and F2 we see that it carries string and D0-brane\ncharge densities \u03a00 and B0 , respectively. The energy density is |\u03a00 | + |B0 |. We also see\nfrom the asymptotic behaviour of the 'dT dY 1 -term' in the metric that, unlike in the\nclosed case, there are now N units of net linear momentum in the 1-direction per unit\narea. Similarly, now there are N units of net D2-brane charge, since asymptotically we\nhave\n\"\n#\nN\nG4 \u223c d\n(4.13)\ndT \u2227 dZ \u2227 dY 1 + * * * .\n5\n~\n5\u03a96 |Y\u22a5 |\nThis is precisely the long-distance field-strength associated to N D2-branes oriented\nalong the ZY 1 -plane.\nThe third feature which allows the solution with the choices (4.4)-(4.6) to be identified with the supertube is that (by construction) it is singular at and only at the\nlocation of the tube Y~ = ~y (\u03c3). In fact, the behaviour of the solution in the region close\nto the singularity will allow us to reproduce the bound (2.36). Let Y~0 = ~y (\u03c30 ) be a\npoint on the tube, ~v = ~y \u2032 (\u03c30 ) the tangent vector and \u03a00 = \u03a0(\u03c30 ) and B0 = B(\u03c30 ) the\nstring and D0-brane densities at that point. By performing an appropriate translation\nand rotation if necessary we assume that Y~0 = 0 and that ~v lies along the 1-direction.\nIt is now straightforward to see that in the limit Y~ \u2192 Y~0 we have\n|\u03a00 |\n+*** ,\n5\u03a96 |~v||Y~\u22a5 |5\n|B0 |\nV \u223c 1+\n+*** ,\n5\u03a96 |~v||Y~\u22a5 |5\nU \u223c 1+\n\nA\u223c\n\n~\n|P|\ndY 1 + * * * ,\n5\u03a96 |~v||Y~\u22a5 |5\n\n(4.14)\n\n~ = N|~v |, with Y~\u22a5 as in (4.12) and where the dots stand for Y~\u22a5 -dependent\nwhere |P|\nsubleading terms. We see that in this limit the tube behaves as an infinite planar\nD2/F1/D0-bound state extending along the ZY 1 -plane which carries a momentum\n~ along the 1-direction. The bound on this density arises now as follows.\ndensity P\nConsider the vector field l \u2261 \u2202/\u2202Y 1 , which becomes tangent to the curve as Y~ \u2192 Y~0 .\nIts norm squared is\n\u0001\n|l|2 = U \u22121 V \u22121/2 UV \u2212 A21 .\n(4.15)\n18\n\n\fThis is always positive sufficiently far away from the tube, and if the bound (2.36)\nis satisfied it remains spacelike everywhere. However, if the bound is violated then l\nbecomes timelike sufficiently close to the point Y~0 . To see this we note that, as Y~ \u2192 Y~0 ,\n(4.15) becomes\n\u0011\u22121/2\n\u0010\nh\ni\n\u0001\n5\n\u22121\n\u22121/2\n\u22122\n2\n~\n|l| = 5\u03a96 |Y\u22a5 |\n|\u03a00 | |B0 |\n|~v|\n|\u03a00 B0 | \u2212 |P| + * * * ,\n2\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere the dots stand for non-negative terms which vanish in this limit. Thus |l|2\nbecomes negative sufficiently close to Y~0 if and only if |P|2 > |\u03a00 B0 |. If this happens\nat every point along the cross-section then curves almost tangent and sufficiently close\nto the supertube are timelike. For a closed cross-section this leads to a global violation\nof causality since these become closed timelike curves. This case was analyzed in detail\nin [10] for a circular cross-section, where it was shown that regions with timelike l also\nlead to another pathology: the appearance of ghost degrees of freedom on appropriate\nbrane probes. The reason is that the coefficient of the kinetic energy of certain fields on\nthe probe is proportional to |l|2 . Since this is a local instability, it will still occur even\nif the bound (2.36) is violated only locally and no closed timelike curves are present.\nHence, it is the requirement of stability of brane probes that leads to the bound (2.36)\nin the supergravity description of supertubes with arbitrary cross-sections.\n\n5. Absence of Tachyons\nIn this section we compute the vacuum energy of the open strings stretched between\ntangent planes of the supertube and show that no tachyons are present. We follow the\nlight-cone gauge boundary state formalism of [14] closely, although in that paper the\nformalism was developed explicitly only for type IIB D-branes. Here we provide the\nslight modification necessary to treat the type IIA D-branes.\n5.1 Generalities\nThe boundary states constructed in [14] in the light-cone-gauge formalism describe\n'(p + 1)-instantons' with Euclidean worldvolume. Since each such (p + 1)-instanton\nis related to an ordinary Dp-brane with Lorentzian worldvolume by a double Wick\nrotation we shall just use the term Dp-brane in the following.\nIn the light-cone description the spacetime coordinates are divided into the lightcone coordinates X + , X \u2212 and the transverse coordinates X I (I = 1, . . . , 8). We shall\nfurther separate the latter into coordinates X i (i = 1, . . . , p+1) parallel to the Dp-brane\nand coordinates X n (n = p + 2, . . . , 8) transverse to it.\n\n19\n\n\fThe boundary state |Bi corresponding to an infinite planar Dp-brane or anti-Dpbrane is completely determined by the orientation of the brane in spacetime and by\nthe worldvolume BI 2-form field-strength Fij . This information is encoded in an O(8)\n'rotation' constructed as follows.\nConsider first a Dp-brane extended along the directions 1, . . . , p. Define the O(8)\nmatrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\nMij\nMIJ =\n,\n(5.1)\nI7\u2212p\nwhere Iq is the (q \u00d7 q)-dimensional identity matrix and\n\u0002\n\u0003\nMij = \u2212 (1 \u2212 F )(1 + F )\u22121 ij .\n\n(5.2)\n\nNote that in the type IIB theory p is odd and hence det M = 1; this is the case\nconsidered explicitly in [14]. We shall instead concentrate on the type IIA theory, for\nwhich p is even and hence det M = \u22121. In this case it is convenient to write M as\nM = D * M\u0303 ,\nwhere\nD\u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212Ip+1\n\nI7\u2212p\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(5.3)\n\nM\u0303 \u2261 D * M .\n\n(5.4)\n\nNote that D 2 = 1 and det M\u0303 = 1.\nThe rotation MIJ gives rise to two different elements in the spinor representation\ndiffering by a sign. In particular, if we write\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nKL\n,\n(5.5)\n\u03a9KL \u03a3\nM\u0303IJ = exp\n2\nIJ\nwhere \u03a3KL are the generators of SO(8) in the vector representation and \u03a9KL = \u2212\u03a9LK\nare constants, then these two elements are\n\u0010\n\u0011\nMab = \u00b1 D * M\u0303\n,\n(5.6)\nab\n\nwhere10 a, b = 1, . . . , 8, \u03b3 I are SO(8) Dirac gamma-matrices and\n\u0001\nD ab = \u03b3 p+2\u03b3 p+3 * * * \u03b3 8 ab ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nIJ\n.\n\u03a9IJ \u03b3\nM\u0303ab = exp\n4\nab\n10\n\n(5.7)\n\nAlthough in the type IIA theory the left-moving and the right-moving spinors have opposite\nchiralities, we shall not explicitly distinguish between chiral and anti-chiral spinor indices, that is,\nbetween dotted and undotted indices.\n\n20\n\n\fThe two possible choices of sign in (5.6) correspond to the possibilities, for fixed orientation and BI field-strength, of a D-brane or an anti-D-brane.\nConsider now a Dp-brane with an arbitrary orientation obtained from the previous\none by an SO(8) rotation m(\u03c6), specified by some angles collectively denoted by \u03c6.\nThen the corresponding matrix M(\u03c6) is\nM(\u03c6) = m\u22121 (\u03c6) * M * m(\u03c6) .\n\n(5.8)\n\nIn particular, when F = 0, a rotation of angle \u03c6 = \u03c0 on a 2-plane with one direction\nparallel to the brane and another direction orthogonal to it leaves MIJ invariant but\nreverses the sign of Mab , and hence it transforms a D-brane into an anti-D-brane and\nviceversa. This is the generalization to branes of any dimension of the familiar fact\nthat reversing the orientation of a string tranforms it into an anti-string.\nThe boundary state is completely specified once M is known, and takes the form\n\u0013\nX\u00121\n(p+1)\nI\nJ\na\nb\nDIJ \u03b1\u2212n \u03b1\u0303\u2212n \u2212 iD ab S\u2212n S\u0303\u2212n |B0 i ,\n(5.9)\n|Bi = \u03b4\u22a5\nR(M\u0303) exp\nn\nn>0\nwhere the delta function above has support on the worldvolume of the brane (see the\nAppendix for details), and the zero-mode factor is\n|B0 i = C (MIJ |Ii|Ji + iMab |ai|bi) .\n\n(5.10)\n\nThe normalization constant C is given in terms of the BI field-strength on the D-brane\nas\np\n(5.11)\nC(F ) = det(1 + F ) .\nFinally, the operator R(M\u0303 ) is the representation of the SO(8)-rotation M\u0303 on non-zero\nmodes:\n\u0013\nX \u0012 1 (\u03b1)\n(S) a\nI\nJ\nb\nR(M\u0303 ) = exp\nTIJ \u03b1\u2212n \u03b1n + Tab S\u2212n Sn ,\n(5.12)\nn\nn>0\n\nwhere\n\n1\n(S)\nKL\nTab = \u03a9KL \u03b3ab\n.\n4\n\n1\n(\u03b1)\nTIJ = \u03a9KL \u03a3KL\nIJ ,\n2\n\n(5.13)\n\nThis satisfies the group property R(M\u03031 )R(M\u03032 ) = R(M\u03031 M\u03032 ).\nThe vacuum energy of a system consisting of two D-branes is due (to the lowest\norder in the string coupling constant) to the exchange of closed strings between them,\nand is given by\nZ \u221e\n\u2212\ndt\n\u2212\nZ=\nhB2 |e\u2212(Pcl \u2212p )t |B1 i ,\n(5.14)\n+\n2p\n0\n\n21\n\n\fwhere |Bk i (k = 1, 2) is the boundary state for the k -th brane, characterized by a\nmatrix Mk . Z factorizes as\nZ = Z0 Zosc ,\n(5.15)\nwhere Zosc depends only on the relative rotation between the branes\nMrel \u2261 M2T * M1 ,\n\n(5.16)\n\nZ0 = C(F1 )C(F2 ) (Trv Mrel \u2212 Trs Mrel ) ,\n\n(5.17)\n\nand\nwhere Trv and Trs are the traces in the vector and the spinor representation, respectively. Note that, except for the product of the normalization factors in Z0 , the vacuum\nenergy depends only on the relative rotation Mrel , which in turn depends only on the\nrelative rotation between the SO(8) parts of M1 and M2 , that is, on\nM\u0303rel \u2261 M\u03032T * M\u03031 = Mrel .\n\n(5.18)\n\n5.2 Vacuum Energy\nAs explained in the Introduction, in order to gain some understanding about the possible presence of tachyons in the spectrum of open strings stretched between arbitrary\npoints of a supertube, one can approximate the worldvolume at each of these points\nby that of an infinite planar D2-brane carrying string and D0-brane charges. In this\nsection we will show that the vacuum energy of two such branes vanishes exactly.\nIt is clear that the two D2-branes of interest will share the time direction, which\nin our Euclidean formulation we may take to be X 1 . They will also share one spatial\ndirection, X 2 say, corresponding to the axis of the supertube (the Z-direction). The\nprojection of each brane on the remaining 6-dimensional space orthogonal to the 12plane is a line in this space (see Figure 2). For a supertube with a generic cross-section\nthese two lines will determine a 2-plane, the 34-plane say, and will form some angle \u03c6\nwith each other, but will not intersect. Instead they will be separated some distance\nL along the remaining 4 overall orthogonal directions X \u22a5 . The particular case \u03c6 = \u03c0\ncorresponds to a parallel D2/anti-D2 pair.\nIn order to construct the boundary states describing each brane, we assume without\nloss of generality that both branes are initially aligned along the 3-direction, and that\nwe then rotate the (say) second brane by an angle \u03c6. Thus before the rotation both\nbranes extend along the 123-directions. Since they carry string charge along the 2direction and D0-brane charge, the BI 2-forms Fk (k = 1, 2) on their worldvolumes\nare\nFk = Ek dX 1 \u2227 dX 2 + Bk dX 2 \u2227 dX 3 ,\n(5.19)\n\n22\n\n\fL\n\nX\n\n\u03c6\nX\n\nX\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 2: Setup of D2-branes tangent to the supertube. Both branes share the 12-directions.\nThe thick lines represent their projections on the 6-dimensional space orthogonal to the 12plane, and both lie along the 34-plane. The 'first' ('second') brane is that on the plane above\n(below).\n\nwhere for the moment we keep the values of the electric and magnetic fields arbitrary.\nk\nThe matrices MIJ\nthen take the form (5.1) with\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u22121 + Ek2 \u2212 Bk2\n2Ek\n\u22122Ek Bk\n1\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\n(5.20)\n\u22122Ek\n\u22121 + Ek2 + Bk2\n2Bk\nMijk = 2\nC (Fk )\n2\n2\n\u22122Ek Bk\n\u22122Bk\n\u22121 \u2212 Ek + Bk\n\nwhere the normalization factor is\n\nC(Fk ) =\n\nq\n\n1 + Ek2 + Bk2 .\n\n(5.21)\n\nThe corresponding spinorial matrix (5.6) for either brane is\nk\nMab\n=\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b3 12...8 * \u03b3 123 + Ek \u03b3 3 + Bk \u03b3 1 ab .\nC(Fk )\n\n(5.22)\n\nNote that we have kept the 'plus' sign in (5.6) for both branes because we are assuming\nthat we start with two parallel branes of the same type, that is, either with two Dbranes or with two anti-D-branes. As mentioned above, the D-brane/anti-D-brane case\nis achieved by setting \u03c6 = \u03c0.\nThe matrix M2 (\u03c6) describing the second brane after the rotation is now obtained\nfrom M2 by conjugation with the rotation matrix m(\u03c6), as in (5.8). In the present case\n\n23\n\n\fm(\u03c6) takes the form\n\n34\n\nm(\u03c6)IJ = exp \u03c6 \u03a3\n\nIJ\n\nin the vector representation, and\nm(\u03c6)ab = exp\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0012\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n1\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03c6 34\n\u03b3\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\uf8f6\n\ncos \u03c6 \u2212 sin \u03c6\nsin \u03c6 cos \u03c6\nI4\n\n=\n\nab\n\n\u0012\n\nei\u03c6/2 I4\ne\u2212i\u03c6/2 I4\n\n\u0013\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(5.23)\n\n(5.24)\n\nin the spinor representation.\nNow we are ready to evaluate the vacuum energy (5.14) explicitly. The zero-mode\nfactor (5.17) is given by\nZ0 (F1 , F2 ) = p\n\n\u03bb\n(1 +\n\nE12\n\n+\n\nB12 )(1\n\n+ E22 + B22 )\n\n\u2212 8 [(1 + E1 E2 ) cos \u03c6 + B1 B2 ] , (5.25)\n\nwhere\n\n\u0002\n\u03bb = 2 3 + E12 + E22 + 4E1 E2 + 3E12 E22 + 4B12 B22 + 2B12 (1 + E22 ) + 2B22 (1 + E12 )\n\u0003\n+4B1 B2 (1 + E1 E2 ) cos \u03c6 + (1 + E12 )(1 + E22 ) cos 2\u03c6 .\n(5.26)\n\nIn the supersymmetric case Z0 = 0 and hence the vacuum energy Z vanishes exactly,\nshowing that there is no force between the branes. To see this, recall that for a supertube with arbitrary shape we have E = \u00b11 and the only restriction on B is that it\ndoes not change sign along the curve. The first condition becomes E1 = E2 = \u00b1i after\nEuclideanization, in which case\nZ0 = 8 (|B1 B2 | \u2212 B1 B2 ) = 0 ,\n\n(5.27)\n\nwhich vanishes since B1 and B2 have equal signs by virtue of the second condition.\nFurthermore, setting Ek = i + \u03b5k and expanding Z0 for small \u03b5k one finds that the first\nterms are of order \u03b52 , as expected from 1/4-supersymmetry. Note that Z0 might also\nvanish for other values of Ek , Bk and \u03c6, but we shall not explore this possibility here.\nWe now turn to evaluate Zosc . This can be done by redefining the oscillators in\n(5.12):\n\u2020\nI\nJ\n\u03b1nI \u2192 UIJ \u03b1nJ , \u03b1\u2212n\n\u2192 UIJ\n\u03b1\u2212n\n,\na\nb\nSna \u2192 Vab Snb , S\u2212n\n\u2192 Vab\u2020 S\u2212n\n,\n\n24\n\n(5.28)\n\n\fwhere the unitary matrices U and V are defined so that they diagonalize the T generators (5.13) of the relative rotation Mrel = M\u0303rel , that is,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\ni\u03b21\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2212i\u03b21\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2020 (\u03b1)\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8ec\ni\u03b22\nU T U =\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u2212i\u03b22\nO4\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\ni\u03b2+ I2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\ni\u03b2\u2212 I2\n\uf8f7,\n(5.29)\nV \u2020 T (S) V = \uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u2212i\u03b2+ I2\n\u2212i\u03b2\u2212 I2\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b21 \u00b1 \u03b22\n.\n(5.30)\n2\nSince Mrel is effectively a rotation in the 1234-directions it is characterized by only two\nangles \u03b21 and \u03b22 . These can be extracted from the relations\n\u03b2\u00b1 =\n\n1\nTrs Mrel\n8\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n2\n(Trs Mrel )2 \u2212 2Trs Mrel\n\u2212 16 .\n(5.31)\ncos \u03b21 + cos \u03b22 =\n16\nNote that the traces are in the spinor representation, since the vector representation of\nM does not distinguish between brane and anti-brane. A straightforward calculation\nshows that for our supersymmetric configurations\ncos (\u03b21 /2) cos (\u03b22 /2) =\n\nTrs Mrel = 8 sgn(B1 B2 ) ,\n\n2\nTrs Mrel\n= 8,\n\n(5.32)\n\nand hence that \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 0.\nThe evaluation of Zosc now proceeds as in [14], with the result\nQ\u221e\nZ \u221e\n(1 \u2212 q 2n ei\u03b2+ )2 (1 \u2212 q 2n e\u2212i\u03b2+ )2 (1 \u2212 q 2n ei\u03b2\u2212 )2 (1 \u2212 q 2n e\u2212i\u03b2\u2212 )2\nP(t, \u03c6, L) ,\nZosc =\ndt Q\u221e n=1\n2n 4\n2n i\u03b21 )(1 \u2212 q 2n e\u2212i\u03b21 )(1 \u2212 q 2n ei\u03b22 )(1 \u2212 q 2n e\u2212i\u03b22 )\n0\nn=1 (1 \u2212 q ) (1 \u2212 q e\n(5.33)\n\u2212\u03c0t\nwhere q = e\nand the factor\n(\nV2 (2\u03c0 2 t)\u22123 | sin \u03c6|\u22121 exp (\u2212L2 /2\u03c0t) if \u03c6 6= 0 mod \u03c0,\nP(t, \u03c6, L) =\n(5.34)\nV3 (2\u03c0 2 t)\u22127/2 exp (\u2212L2 /2\u03c0t)\nif \u03c6 = 0 mod \u03c0,\narises essentially from the delta-functions in (5.9) (see the Appendix). In particular,\nthe constants V2 and V3 are the (infinite) volumes of the branes in the 12- and 123directions respectively. In view of the periodicity of Zosc , we assume that \u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b2+\nand \u03b2\u2212 all lie within the interval [0, 2\u03c0).\n\n25\n\n\fThe result can be rewritten in a compact form in terms of Jacobi \u03b8-functions and\nthe Dedekind \u03b7-function:\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2 \u03b2\u2212\n2 \u03b2+\nZ \u221e\n\u03b21\n\u03b22\n\u03b81 2\u03c0 | it \u03b81 2\u03c0 | it\nsin 2 sin 2\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0001\n\u0001 P(t, \u03c6, L) .

These divergence signals the appearance of a tachyonic instability. Supersymmetric configurations\nare free of this instability, as we wanted to see, since in this case \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 0. Note\nthat, in fact, there is no tachyonic instability in any brane configuration with \u03b21 = \u03b22 ,\nalthough generically there will still be a force between the branes unless Z0 = 0. Again,\nwe shall not explore these more general possibilities here.\n\n6. Discussion\nWe have generalized the 1/4-supersymmetric D2-brane supertube with circular crosssection [6], to one for which the cross-section is an arbitrary curve in E8 . This obviously\nincludes the system of a parallel 1/4-supersymmetric D2-brane and anti-D2-brane of\n[9] as a special case. In many respects, this result is counter-intuitive. While it is not\ndifficult to imagine how a circular tube may be supported from collapse by angular\nmomentum, it is less obvious how this is possible when the cross-section is non-circular\nand non-planar: one would imagine that this would imply a clash between the need\n11\n\nZosc might appear to diverge (to vanish) when \u03b21 and/or \u03b22 (\u03b2+ and/or \u03b2\u2212 ) vanish because of\nthe sine factors in (5.36). This is not the case, however, as is manifest from (5.33) or as can be seen\ndirectly from (5.36) by noting that lim\u03bd\u21920 \u03b81 (\u03bd|\u03c4 )/ sin(\u03c0\u03bd) = 2\u03b7 3 (\u03c4 ) for any finite \u03c4 . Thus the formula\n(5.37) gives the correct asymptotic behaviour of the integrand for any value of \u03b21 and \u03b22 .\n\n26\n\n\ffor angular momentum to prevent collapse and the need for time-independence of the\nenergy density to preserve supersymmetry. Of course this problem already arose for\nthe elliptical supertube found in [9] but that was found in the context of the Matrix\nmodel and, as we have pointed out, the implications of results in Matrix Theory for\nsupertube configurations are not immediately clear. Nevertheless, it was the results of\n[9] that motivated us to re-examine the assumption of circular symmetry for supertubes\nin the DBI context and, on finding that any cross-section is possible, to re-examine the\nreasons underlying the stability of the supertube.\nWe identified three sources of instability in the Introduction. The most obvious\none is the potential local instability due to D2-brane tension and we have now dealt\nfairly exhaustively with that. In particular, we have seen how the D2-brane charge\nin the spacetime supersymmetry algebra can be 'cancelled' by the linear momentum\ngenerated by the BI fields; this for example allows a D2-brane extending to infinity\n(and hence carrying a net charge) to have an arbitrary cross-section while preserving\nsupersymmetry. This simple mechanism of 'brane-charge cancellation by momentum'\nmay have other applications.\nA second potential instability is due to long-range supergravity forces. This was\ndealt with for a supertube with a circular cross-section in [10]. Here we have generalized\nthat analysis to an arbitrary cross-section. A main consequence of this generalization\nis that the bound on the total angular momentum of [10] becomes a bound on the local\nlinear momentum density. Violation of the bound in [10] was shown to lead to the\nappearance of closed timelike curves and ghost-induced instabilities on brane probes.\nHere we have seen that although local violations of the bound on the momentum density\ndo not necessarily imply the presence of closed timelike curves, they do induce ghost\ninstabilities on brane probes. Bound-violating solutions are consequently unstable,\nwhereas bound-respecting solutions are stable at the supergravity level.\nFinally, there is a potential source of instability due to tachyon condensation, and\none of the principal purposes of this paper has been to demonstrate that no tachyons\nappear in the spectrum of open strings ending on a supertube. We have accomplished\nslightly less than this since existing methods apply only to planar branes. Specifically,\nwe have shown that no tachyons appear in the spectrum of open strings connecting\nany two tangent planes of the supertube. This includes the case of strings connecting\na D2-brane with an anti-D2-brane, provided that the DBI fields are those required for\nthe preservation of 1/4 supersymmetry.\nNote added in proof: While this paper was being type-written we received [15],\nwhere some results which partially overlap with those of our Section 5 are obtained by\ndifferent methods.\n\n27\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure to thank Michael B.

For clarity, we\nexplicitly put hats on operators.\nConsider the general case of two Dp-branes which extend along p common directions\n(collectively denoted as Xk ), whose projections on the 34-plane are as in Figure 2, and\n\u22a5\nwhich lie at the positions x\u22a5\n1 and x2 in the remaining 6\u2212p overall transverse directions.\nAt the end we will specialize to the case of interest to us for which p = 2, Xk = (X 1 , X 2 )\n\u22a5\nand |x\u22a5\n2 \u2212 x1 | = L.\nThe P-factor in Zosc is\nP = hp = 0| \u03b42\u22a5 q\n\nP\u0302 2\n2\n\n\u03b41\u22a5 |p = 0i \u2261 P k P 3\u22124 P \u22a5 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere q = e\u2212\u03c0t ,\nP k = hpk =0|pk =0i ,\nP 3\u22124 = hp3 =p4 =0|\u03b4(X\u03023\u2032 ) q\n\nP\u030232\n2\n\n\u03b4(X\u03023 )|p3 =p4 =0i ,\n\nP \u22a5 = hp\u22a5 =0| \u03b4(X\u0302 \u22a5 \u2212 x\u22a5\n2 )q\n\n2\nP\u0302\u22a5\n2\n\n\u03b4(X\u0302 \u22a5 \u2212 x\u22a5\n1 )|p\u22a5 =0i ,\n\n(A.2)\n\nand\nX\u03023\u2032 = cos \u03c6 X\u03023 + sin \u03c6 X\u03024 .\n\n(A.3)\n\nThe first factor is just the p-dimensional (infinite) volume of the directions common\nto both branes, P k = Vp .
