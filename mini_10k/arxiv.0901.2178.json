For the oriented 3-dimensional handlebody constructed from a 3-ball\nby attaching g 1-handles, it is shown that the natural surjection from the group of\norientation preserving diffeomorphisms of it to the mapping class group of it has no\nsection when g is at least 6.\n\nLet M be an n-dimensional compact oriented manifold and S be a subset of \u2202M. We\ndenote the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of M whose restrictions on\nS are identity by Diff(M, S), the subgroups of them consisting of elements that are\nisotopic to identity by Diff 0 (M, S), and the quotient group Diff(M, S)/Diff 0 (M, S)\nby M(M, S). For an element f of Diff(M, S), let [f ] be the element of M(M, S)\nrepresented by f . The homomorphism \u03c0M,S from Diff(M, S) to M(M, S) defined\nby \u03c0M,S (h) = [h] is a surjection. Let \u0393 be a subgroup of M(M, S). We call a\nhomomorphism s from \u0393 to Diff(M, S) which satisfies \u03c0M,S \u25e6s = id\u0393 a section for \u03c0M,S\nover \u0393. Morita [7] showed that the natural surjection from Diff 2 (\u03a3g ) to the mapping\nclass group M(\u03a3g ) of \u03a3g has no section over M(\u03a3g ) when g \u2265 5. Markovic [5] (when\ng \u2265 6) and Markovic and Saric [6] (when g \u2265 2) showed that the natural surjection\nfrom Homeo(\u03a3g ) to M(\u03a3g ) has no section over M(\u03a3g ). By using the different method\nfrom them, Franks and Handel [2] showed that the natural surjection from Diff(\u03a3g )\nto M(\u03a3g ) has no section over M(\u03a3g ) when g \u2265 3.\nLet Hg be an oriented 3-dimensional handlebody of genus g, which is an oriented\n3-manifold constructed from a 3-ball by attaching g 1-handles. Let \u03a3g be an oriented\nclosed surface of genus g, then \u2202Hg = \u03a3g . The restriction to the boundary defines\na homomorphism \u03c1\u2202 : Diff(Hg ) \u2192 Diff(\u03a3g ), and \u03c1\u2202 induces a injection M(Hg ) \u0592\u2192\nM(\u03a3g ) since Hg is an irreducible 3-manifold. We will show:\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 57M60, 57N10.\nThis research was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (No. 20540083), Japan\nSociety for the Promotion of Science.\n\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1. If g \u2265 6, there is no section for \u03c0Hg : Diff(Hg ) \u2192 M(Hg ) over M(Hg ).\nFor contradiction, we assume that there is a section s : M(Hg ) \u2192 Diff(Hg ). Let\n\u0393 be a subgroup of M(Hg ), and i\u0393 be the inclusion from \u0393 to M(Hg ). Then \u0393 is a\nsubgroup of M(\u03a3g ), and the composition \u03c1\u2202 \u25e6 s \u25e6 i\u0393 is a section for \u03c0\u03a3g : Diff(\u03a3g ) \u2192\nM(\u03a3g ) over \u0393. Therefore, if we can find a subgroup \u0393 of M(Hg ), over which there is\nno section for \u03c0\u03a3g , then Theorem 1 follows.\nLet D be a 2-disk in \u03a3g , and \u03a3g,1 be \u03a3g \\ int D. Let c be an essential simple closed\ncurve on \u03a3g such that \u03a3g \\ c is not connected, then the closure of one component of\n\u03a3g \\ c is diffeomorphic to \u03a3g1 ,1 and the closure of the other component of \u03a3g \\ c is\ndiffeomorphic to \u03a3g2 ,1 . We remark that g = g1 + g2 and g1 , g2 \u2265 1. These diffeomorphisms induce injections M(\u03a3g1 ,1 , \u2202\u03a3g1 ,1 ) \u2192 M(\u03a3g ) and M(\u03a3g2 ,1 , \u2202\u03a3g2 ,1 ) \u2192 M(\u03a3g )\n(see [8]). By these injections, we consider M(\u03a3g1 ,1 , \u2202\u03a3g1 ,1 ) and M(\u03a3g2 ,1 , \u2202\u03a3g1 ,1 ) as\nsubgroups of M(\u03a3g ). From Theorem 1.6 in [2] proved by Franks and Handel, we see:\nTheorem 2. [2] Let \u03931 be a nontrivial finitely generated subgroup of M(\u03a3g1 ,1 , \u2202\u03a3g1 ,1 )\nsuch that H 1 (\u03931 , R) = 0, and \u03bc be an element of M(\u03a3g2 ,1 , \u2202\u03a3g2 ,1 ) which is represented\nby a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism on int \u03a3g2 ,1 . Then there is no section for \u03c0\u03a3g :\nDiff(\u03a3g ) \u2192 M(\u03a3g ) over h\u03931 , \u03bci.\nWe assume g \u2265 6. The 3-manifold \u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1] is diffeomorphic to H4 . Let D1\nbe a 2-disk in int \u2202\u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2282 \u2202(\u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1]), D2 and D3 be disjoint 2-disks on\n\u2202Hg\u22126 , and D4 be 2-disk on \u2202H2 . Along these 2-disks, we glue \u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1], Hg\u22126\nand H2 such that D1 = D2 , D3 = D4 , then the 3-manifold obtained as a result\nis diffeomorphic to Hg . By the above construction, we get two natural inclusions\n\u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1] \u0592\u2192 Hg and H2 \u0592\u2192 Hg . These inclusions induce natural homomorphisms\ni1 : M(\u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1], \u2202\u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1]) \u2192 M(Hg ) and i2 : M(H2 , D4 ) \u2192 M(Hg ). If [h] is\nin M(\u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1], \u2202\u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1]) (resp. M(H2 , D4 )) represented by h \u2208 Diff(\u03a32,1 \u00d7\n[0, 1], \u2202\u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1]) (resp. Diff(H2 , D4 )), then i1 ([h]) (resp. i2 ([h]) is represented by\nextending h to Hg using the identity mapping on Hg \\ \u03a32,1 \u00d7 [0, 1] (resp. Hg \\ H2 ).\nWe define homomorphisms \u03a0 : Diff(\u03a32,1 , \u2202\u03a32,1 ) \u2192 Diff(\u03a32,1 \u00d7[0, 1], \u2202\u03a32,1 \u00d7[0, 1]) by\n\u03a0(h) = h\u00d7id[0,1] , and I1 : Diff(\u03a32,1 \u00d7[0, 1], \u2202\u03a32,1 \u00d7[0, 1]) \u2192 Diff(Hg ) by the identity on\nHg \\\u03a32,1 \u00d7[0, 1], then the composition I1 \u25e6\u03a0 induces an injection P : M(\u03a32,1 , \u2202\u03a32,1 ) \u2192\n\n2\n\n\fM(Hg ). By applying Corollary 4.2 of [8] to the subsurface \u03a32,1 \u00d7 {0, 1} \u2282 \u2202Hg , the\ninjectivity of P is shown. Korkmaz [4] showed that H1 (M(\u03a32,1 , \u2202\u03a32,1 ), Z) = Z/10 Z,\nhence H 1 (M(\u03a32,1 , \u2202\u03a32,1 ), R) = 0. Therefore, \u03931 = P (M(\u03a32,1 , \u2202\u03a32,1 )) satisfies the\nassumption of Theorem 2 when g1 = g \u2212 2, g2 = 2.\nFathi and Laudenbach [3] constructed a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism \u03c6 on \u2202(H2 )\nwhich is a restriction of a homeomorphism on H2 . Definition of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms and terminologies (e.g., singular foliation) related to them can be found\nin [1]. Any pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism preserves the set of singular points of the\nsingular foliation which is preserved by this homeomorphism. Since the number of\nsingular points of singular foliation is finite, a proper power of \u03c6, say \u03c6n , fixes some\npoints. Let p be a point fixed by \u03c6n , then \u03c6n defines a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism\non \u2202(H2 ) \\ p = int \u03a32,1 . Let \u03bc be an element of M(\u03a32,1 , \u2202\u03a32,1 ) \u2282 M(\u03a3g ) represented\nby this homomorphism, then \u03bc is an element of M(Hg ) and satisfies the assumption\nof Theorem 2 when g1 = g \u2212 2, g2 = 2.\nThen hP (M(\u03a32,1, \u2202\u03a32,1 )), \u03bci is a subgroup of M(Hg ) and, by Theorem 2, there\nis no section hP (M(\u03a32,1, \u2202\u03a32,1 )), \u03bci \u2192 M(\u03a3g ). Therefore, there is no section for\n\u03c0Hg : Diff(Hg ) \u2192 M(Hg ) over M(Hg ).\nReferences\n[1] A. J. Casson, S. A.
