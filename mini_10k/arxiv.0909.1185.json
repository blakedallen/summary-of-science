Introduction\nHistorically, diamond used in industrial applications has been appreciated for its combination of\nextreme hardness and wear resistance. However, it has long been recognized that diamond is a\nremarkable material with other properties \u2013 optical, thermal, electrochemical, chemical, electronic\n\u2013 that also outclass competing materials. When these properties are combined, they offer the\ndesigner an engineering material with tremendous potential, offering solutions that can shift\nperformance to new levels or enabling completely new approaches to challenging problems.\nDiamond grown using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) processes has released the broad\nengineering potential of diamond by making available material with consistent characteristics,\ntailored to end applications. This is in contrast to the wide variation in natural diamond, where the\nchallenges of selecting individual stones with the right characteristics and properties for a\nparticular engineering application put a prohibitive cost on its use in all but a few niche areas\n(figure 1).\nIn 1992 there were a few high technology application areas of diamond, including optoelectronic\nswitches, radiation detectors, transmission components and lasers, alongside the more traditional\nuses such as anvils, hardness indenters and styli for materials science applications, surgical blades\nand heat sinks. Most or all of the diamond products sold for high technology applications were\nmade from either natural or High Pressure, High Temperature (HPHT) synthetic diamond\n\n1\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\n(section 2.1). CVD diamond had only been used as an X-ray mask support and was expected to\nbe used as an infra-red transmission window within a few years (Seal 1992). The first\ncommercial CVD products were being produced for abrasive applications in the machining\nsector, and for heat spreading.\nIn 2009, many grades of synthetic diamond are available from several suppliers, with more\nroutine materials being available via e-shops with the click of a mouse and a credit card\n(www.e6cvd.com). Polycrystalline diamond windows in excess of 100 mm diameter and 1.5 mm\nthick are routinely fabricated for optical and microwave transmission windows (Godfried et al.\n2000, Thumm 2007) and thick free-standing single crystal CVD diamond is fabricated into\noptical components with at least one dimension in excess of 5 mm (Mildren et al. 2008) or with\nsuch exceptional purity as to make the material suitable for a number of electronic applications\n(Isberg et al. 2002, Twitchen et al. 2004, Secroun et al. 2007, Nesladek et al. 2008).\nSynthesis of diamond by CVD has not only contributed to reducing the costs of the material but\nhas enabled the extreme properties of diamond to be fully utilized. Components using CVD\ndiamond now span tweeters for loudspeakers, radiation detectors and sensors, optical components\nfor lasers, windows for RF and microwave transmission, a range of blades and cutting tools, and\nelectrodes for electrochemical sensing, ozone generation and direct oxidation of organic matter.\nFurther, in active development there are new applications including high power electronics,\nquantum optics and erosion resistant coatings in nuclear fusion reactors.\nDevelopments in material synthesis and processing are leading to high purity and low defect\ngrades of the material, such as an ultra-low birefringence single crystal CVD diamond (Friel et al.\n2009). This provides a step forward for all photonics applications of diamond, and is being\ntrialled in laser applications. Quantum purity grade diamond, in which both chemical and\nisotopic impurities are controlled (Balasubramanian et al 2009), complements electronic, optical\nand thermal grades already in commercial production.\nOver the last few years several companies have been established to exploit the commercial\npotential of CVD diamond material. These cover wastewater treatment systems; ozone generation\nequipment; developing active electronic devices using CVD diamond; and diamond detectors for\nmarkets including medical X-ray dosimetry, radiation monitoring in the nuclear and defence\nindustries, data logging in oil well exploration and UV photolithography for semiconductor\nmanufacturing.\nThese investments, coupled with the broad range of applications being developed elsewhere,\nshow that a new age of industrial diamond has truly begun \u2013 that of CVD diamond.\n1.1 Scope of this review\nThis paper provides an up to date overview of the key properties of diamond in its main\napplications areas. The origin of those properties and their sensitivity to defects in the diamond is\nexplained, so that the engineer can more easily understand the appropriate specification for the\ndiamond, and the main design considerations when using diamond. This review focuses on\napplications of diamond based on its bulk material properties: mechanical, thermal, optical,\nelectronic and electrochemical, and does not include areas such as: quantum applications (Jelesko\nand Wrachtrup 2008), biological applications of diamond (Nebel et al. 2007a,b) or nanodiamond\n(grown by CVD (Zhou et al. 1998) or separated by milling (Liang et al. 2009)) which has\ndemonstrated a range of applications (Rittweger et al. 2009, Williams et al. 2008, Hu et al. 2008,\nAuciello et al. 2004).\n\n2\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\n2. Growth of diamond\n2.1 Thermodynamically stable synthesis - HPHT and natural diamond\nAt room temperature and pressure, graphite is the stable allotrope of carbon while diamond is a\nmetastable allotrope. The genesis of natural diamond is believed to occur at depths of around\n200 km, corresponding to pressures and temperatures of 70-80 kbar and 1400-1600\u00b0C (Blatt and\nTracy 1996, Finnerty and Boyd 1984). This is in the region of the carbon phase diagram where\ndiamond is thermodynamically stable (figure 2).\nNatural diamonds (figure 1) have grown in a variety of uncontrolled environments and their\ncomposition and growth habits vary significantly. Robertson et al. (1934) divided them into\ntypes I and II on the basis of optical absorption. We now know that the extra absorption between\n230 and 300 nm and in the infra-red around 8 \u03bcm in type I diamonds is due to the presence of\nnitrogen. Other properties are summarized in table 5.\nThe first industrialized method of synthesising diamond was the HPHT method (Bundy et al.\n1955). Diamond is produced in the thermodynamically stable regime from a locally carbon-rich\nmelt. In contrast to natural genesis, the presence of a solvent metal, such as Fe, Co or Ni, was\nfound to be essential to a practical process (Bundy 1963). Pal'yanov et al. (1997) presents a\nreview of HPHT growth.\nThe HPHT growth process offers a significant degree of control over the quality and geometry of\ndiamond obtained. Most diamond produced by this method is small grains of type Ib for use in\ngrinding and other abrasive applications. Longer, controlled growth periods enable production of\nsingle crystal Ib stones with dimensions routinely up to 8 mm, again typically used in abrasive\ntools. Section 3.2 discusses the wear properties of diamond.\nAddition of selected getter mixtures (for example Ti, Al, Zr) to the capsule enables growth of\ntype IIa diamond (Burns et al. 1999, Sumiya et al. 2002). In this case any nitrogen present is\npreferentially bound to the getter, rather than being incorporated in the diamond lattice.\nExtraordinary degrees of lattice perfection have been achieved in processes similar to this, where\nthe slow, well-controlled growth has generated areas of over 4 \u00d7 4 mm2 with no detectable\nextended defects (Burns et al. 2007).\n2.2 Metastable synthesis - CVD\nDiamond can also be synthesized in its metastable regime. Growth by Chemical Vapour\nDeposition (CVD) was first performed in 1952 and work leading to industrialized processes was\nreported in the 1980s (Martineau et al. 2004 and references therein). More recently, synthesis\nunder a variety of hydrothermal conditions has been reported (Chen and Chen 2008, Szymanski\net al. 1995, Zhao et al. 1997, Roy et al. 1996, Korablov et al. 2006) although the technique has\nnot been widely developed.\nBeing in the region where diamond is metastable compared to graphite, synthesis of diamond\nunder CVD conditions is driven by kinetics and not thermodynamics. Diamond synthesis by\nCVD is normally performed using a small fraction of carbon (typically <5%) in an excess of\nhydrogen. If molecular hydrogen is heated to temperatures in excess of 2000K, there is a\nsignificant dissociation to atomic hydrogen. The heating can be by arc-jet (Luque et al. 1998,\nOwano et al. 1991, hot filament (Herlinger 2006), microwave plasma (Sevillano 1998) or DC arc\n(Abe et al. 2006, Baik et al. 1999) or even by using an oxy-acetylene flame (Bachmann et al.\n1991). In the presence of a suitable substrate material (table 1), diamond can be deposited.\n\n3\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nWith a well designed reaction chamber, the majority of the impurities in the gas mixture come\nfrom the source gases. Many gases are now available commercially containing less than 1 ppm\ntotal impurities. The low concentrations of source gas impurities have contributed to the growth\nof diamond with exceptionally high purity (Twitchen et al. 2004, Tallaire et al. 2006, Kasu and\nKobayashi 2003) applicable to electronic and quantum applications.\nAs well as controllable purity, another significant aspect of CVD diamond growth is that large\nareas of diamond can be obtained. While very few natural, single crystal gem diamonds have\ndimensions exceeding 15 mm, freestanding polycrystalline diamond wafers are routinely\nmanufactured in discs exceeding 100 mm (Baik et al. 1999, Heidinger et al. 2002, Parshin et al.\n2004). Thin diamond coatings are available with dimensions exceeding 300 mm (Herlinger\n2006).\nIn contrast to HPHT or natural diamond, CVD synthesized diamond can also be deposited\nconformally on shaped substrates, enabling growth of items such as speaker domes (section 3.3),\nshaped and patterned components (W\u00f6rner et al. 2001, Ribbing et al. 2003, Jubber et al. 1998)\nand missile domes (Wort et al. 1999).\n2.2.1 Forms of CVD diamond. Most macroscopic solid materials can be divided into three broad\nclasses - amorphous, polycrystalline and single crystal. Amorphous materials are characterized\nby a lack of long range order. They include glasses, plastics and diamond-like carbons (DLCs).\nPolycrystalline materials are also common, including most metals, metal alloys, and igneous\nrocks. These are composed of small single crystals (grains) bound tightly together by a thin\ndisordered interface.\nMacroscopic single crystals do exist, but are much less common. They can be found in nature,\nincluding gem diamonds, or as occasional rock crystals tens of centimetres long. Engineered\nsingle crystals of metal superalloys are used in jet engine turbine blades. Some optical devices,\nincluding lasers, use single crystals including sapphire. The most widely used macroscopic single\ncrystal of our era is silicon. Semiconductor grade silicon is grown in boules up to 400 mm\ndiameter and over 1 metre long, before being extensively sliced, diced and processed into the\nubiquitous electronic chip.\nDiamond grown by CVD can fall into two of these categories - polycrystalline and single crystal.\nSingle crystal diamond is formed by homoepitaxial growth, where the seed, or substrate, is a\nsingle crystal diamond (natural, HPHT, or CVD). Polycrystalline diamond is typically formed\nwhenever growth occurs on a non-diamond substrate.\nUnlike many other polycrystalline materials, the grain structure of polycrystalline diamond has a\nnon-uniform composition. The grains show a preferred direction, and vary dramatically in size\nfrom one side of a polycrystalline diamond wafer to the other. This is due to the growth process.\nA high density of nucleation sites (up to 1012 cm-2 in Baldwin et al. (2006)) is initially formed on\nthe substrate. Each of these sites grows, but grains with favoured facets and orientations grow\npreferentially with respect to their less favoured neighbours. This growth competition increases\nthe size of grains to around 10% of the layer thickness; each surviving grain can be traced back to\na single nucleation point at the substrate surface.\nIn addition to homoepitaxial growth, significant efforts have gone into single crystal diamond\ngrowth by heteroepitaxy. The non-diamond substrate is chosen so that nucleating grains are\ncrystallographically aligned, and strain and lattice mismatch are minimized. Careful control of\nthe growth conditions is required to ensure that the grains remain aligned in both the growth plane\n\n4\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nand growth direction and can coalesce. Films up to 100 mm diameter have been demonstrated on\niridium with a maximum thickness of around 50 \u03bcm (Fischer et al. 2008). As with\nheteroepitaxial growth of other materials, extended defects propagate from the original grain\nboundaries but, unlike them, diamond cannot be readily annealed to create a low defect single\ncrystal.\n2.2.2 CVD growth conditions. The features uniting most methods of growing diamond by CVD\nare gas temperatures in excess of 2000 K, and a gas phase carbon fraction of a few percent in a\nbackground of hydrogen. Common variations include oxygen addition and addition of up to a few\npercent of nitrogen, as well as elements added explicitly for doping\nThe carbon fraction can be supplied in many forms - if simple hydrocarbons are used, it has been\nshown that there is no significant difference between the results obtained using CH4 or C2H2 as\nsource (Cheesman et al. 2006) as there is rapid interconversion between C1 and Cn species.\nAddition of oxygen has been suggested to enable deposition at lower substrate temperatures, be\nbeneficial to the quality of the diamond under some circumstances, but may be responsible for a\nweakening of polycrystalline diamond (Petherbridge et al. 2001, Yan et al. 2002, Harris et al.\n1999). The tie-line dividing diamond growth and etching in the Bachmann diagram (Bachmann\net al. 1991) approximately links CO and H2. These can be considered to be two \"background\"\ngases for CVD diamond growth, with CO being formed whichever combination of oxygen and\ncarbon source gases is used.\nNitrogen is difficult to eliminate from the growth of diamond by HPHT and is incorporated in\ndifferent amounts in different growth sectors. Its near ubiquity in natural diamonds demonstrates\nthat it is often involved in natural genesis. For growth by CVD the addition of ppm levels of\nnitrogen has been shown to modify the morphology and texture of polycrystalline films, increase\nthe growth rate (Locher et al. 1994) and eventually weaken the grain boundaries. An extreme\nexample of its involvement is in growth of single crystal CVD diamond at substrate temperatures\n~1100\u00b0C. In this case, its presence is essential at levels between 0.1% and 0.6% (Yan et al. 2002)\nand may be playing a role in surface stabilisation as well as its normal role in catalytic growth\nrate enhancement.\nWhile some polycrystalline diamond can be grown under most conditions in table 1, few\nconditions will produce high quality growth on all facets of diamond. Morphology models can\npredict development of the shape of single crystal diamond (Wild et al. 1993, Silva et al. 2006).\nIf the {111} faces in figure 3 do not grow epitaxially, possibly due to twinning (Sawada and\nIchinose 2005), this would lead to termination, rather than growth, of the single crystal.\nHowever, the same growth conditions may be acceptable for growth of polycrystalline diamond\nwith its initial random orientation of grains.\nTable 1. Summary of conditions which can lead to diamond growth if the gas temperature is in\nexcess of 2000K, such as in a microwave plasma. [The hot plasma conditions mean that there is\nrapid interconversion between C1 and C2 species such that replacing CH4 with C2H2 etc leads to\nsimilar results.]\nCondition\nAcceptable range\nSubstrate temperature\n700-1300\u00b0C\nSi, Mo, W, Ti, diamond, materials\nPossible substrate materials\nwith low carbon solubility\n\n5\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\n[CH 4 ]\n[H 2 ] + [CO]\n[N 2 ]\n[CH 4 ] + [H 2 ] + [CO ]\n\n0.1-10%\n0-0.6%\n\nWhile polycrystalline diamond can be grown over large areas, similar sizes of single crystal\ndiamond substrates are not available. HPHT diamond has been synthesized up to approximately\n20 mm in one dimension (Koivula et al. 1993), but is ultimately limited by the size of capsule\nused and stability of the process for a long run. Progress has been made in extending the size of\ndiamond through CVD synthesis both laterally (Silva et al. 2008) and vertically up to around 10\nmm (Mokuno et al. 2006); single crystal CVD synthetic diamond plates up to 8 mm square are\navailable commercially (www.e6cvd.com). Ways of joining multiple diamond single crystals\ntogether to create a single larger area crystal has also been the subject of patent applications (e.g.\nMeguro et al. 2005), but this generally suffers many of the problems of heteroepitaxy, and is not\nthought to be in widespread use.\n2.3 Defects in diamond grown by CVD\nPerfect diamond would consist entirely of sp3 bonded carbon at every point on the lattice. In\npolycrystalline diamond, the most obvious deviation from this is the grain boundaries. While\nforming the boundary between crystallites with different orientations, they consist largely of\ndisordered sp3 bonded carbon, and a high proportion of hydrogen (Reichart et al. 2003),\npresumably at dangling bonds. However, as long as the bulk properties remain dominated by the\ngrains and not the grain boundaries, polycrystalline diamond can be a technologically excellent\nproduct showing similar properties to that of bulk single crystals.\nOnce the grain boundaries are removed, and single crystal diamond is investigated, extended and\npoint defects become more apparent. Extended defects include twins, vacancy clusters\n(Hounsome et al. 2006) and dislocations. The effects of dislocations in single crystal CVD\ndiamond are discussed in section 5.6.\nMoving to smaller scales, we arrive at point defects. A great variety of point defects occur in\ndiamond (optically active absorption by defects take up 247 pages in Zaitsev (2001)). One class\nof point defects that is rarely reported is the interstitial, as the high atomic density and rigid lattice\nleave little room for foreign atoms. Despite the high atomic density, small substitutional defects\nare found to occur, such as nitrogen and boron, presumably due to non-equilibrium chemical\nbonding processes occurring on the diamond growth surface. These can act as electron donors\nand acceptors (section 6.1). Other non-carbon atoms that have been identified in CVD diamond\nin defect complexes include Si, P and S (Edmonds et al. 2008, Zaitsev 2001, Gheeraert et al.\n2002).\nMany complexes of defects including vacancies and hydrogen have been identified and studied\nby techniques including absorption, luminescence and EPR spectroscopies (Glover et al. 2003,\nGlover et al. 2004, Baker 2007, Felton et al. 2008). The ability to control the isotopes in the\nCVD growth environment has assisted in discovering the nature of many defects. A further\ndegree of freedom in defect complexes is charge. For example, Fritsch et al. (2007) have\nsuggested that charge transfer between defects is the cause of colour changes in natural\n\"chameleon\" diamonds, and Khan et al. (2009) (this issue) reports similar effects in CVD\ndiamond.\n\n6\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nMany defects in CVD diamond are associated with sp2 bonded carbon, which can be identified in\nRaman spectroscopy. The sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy to sp2 bonding increases with\nexcitation wavelength (Wagner et al. 1991, Prawer and Nemanich 2004). In high quality\ndiamond, the peak attributed to sp2 carbon can be barely detectable even with infra-red excitation.\n2.4 Different grades in diamond\nThe properties of CVD diamond are strongly influenced by the grain structure and impurity\ncontent (Morelli et al. 1991, Koidl and Klages 1992). Simply, larger grained higher purity\nmaterial results in higher thermal conductivity and lower optical absorption, while finer grained\nlayers have superior mechanical performance. These parameters can be controlled by the\nsynthesis conditions, thus the characteristics of CVD diamond films can be tailored with different\nproperties as illustrated in figure 4.\nAs the applications for polycrystalline CVD diamond increase, there is constant development and\nrefinement of the properties. Large area polycrystalline diamond plates are used in both detector\nand RF window applications and specific grades have been developed with optimal\ncharacteristics for these applications (Whitehead et al. 2001, Brandon et al. 2001). As new\napplications and manufacturers emerge no doubt different optimized grades of CVD diamond will\nfollow.\nSingle crystal CVD diamond grown homoepitaxially on HPHT substrates has followed a similar\npattern, becoming a commercially available material earlier this decade. Grades optimized for\ncutting, electronic and optical applications are emerging.\n3. Mechanical and wear properties\n3.1 Diamond's strength\nThe strength of diamond is attributable to its high density of very strong bonds. Failure is\ntypically by crack propagation, and dislocation creep does not occur in diamond at normal\ntemperatures. Field (1992) extensively reviewed the literature relating to the strength of natural\ndiamond; it is apparent that there are practical difficulties in measurement because of the\nextremely limited availability of diamond in large sizes and the high cost of obtaining and\nprocessing such material.\nA theoretical analysis based on the elastic modulus, fracture surface energy and nearest neighbour\ndistance gives a theoretical strength of about 200 GPa (~one fifth of Young's modulus).\nApplying Griffith's equation with crack lengths of order 10 nm gives a theoretical strength\napproaching 10 GPa (Field 1992).\nClearly diamond is a potentially very strong material, but its behaviour is highly notch sensitive\n(meaning that stress concentrating surface flaws have a large effect on the fracture strength due to\nthe extremely low level of plastic deformation at the tip of the flaw) and therefore its measured\nstrength is not single-valued and has to be treated using Weibull statistics (for example Waterman\nand Ashby (1991)). Thus, the strength of a diamond is dependent upon its history and\nparticularly the last stage of surface processing to which it has been subjected.\n3.1.1 Single Crystal Diamond. Measuring the strength of single crystal diamond is technically\nchallenging because cost necessitates the use of small samples. Much work has used indentation\nmethods as the volume of material required is much lower (see Brookes (1992) for a thorough\nreview of this data). The consistent preparation of sample surfaces for mechanical tests is a major\nproblem and almost certainly affects the results and makes their reproduction difficult.\n\n7\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nAs part of an unpublished study (Whitehead 1995), a jig was specially made for clamping the end\nof a beam. The clamp was designed to clamp parallel and the clamping surfaces were made from\npolycrystalline cubic boron nitride to minimize the extent of deformation at the clamped edge.\nPlates about 5 mm x 3 mm were prepared from large HPHT and natural type IIa single crystals,\nwith all surfaces polished to an Ra (mean modulus surface deviation) of less than 1 nm. 15 HPHT\nplates (thickness 0.5 mm) and five natural plates (thickness 0.2 mm) were tested. The results are\nin table 2, although no Weibull modulus is given for the natural samples. In all cases, the failure\nmode was cleavage on one or more {111} planes.\nA later study using the same testing protocol (Houwman 2003) measured the strength of a large\nnumber of CVD single crystal plates together with a further 14 natural type IIa samples. All of\nthese samples were polished to a surface roughnesses (Rq \u2013 root mean square surface deviation)\nof order 1 nm. Strengths of up to 5.1 GPa were measured for the CVD single crystal diamond\nplates and around 4.5 GPa for the type IIa natural diamond plates. However the spread of values\nobtained was wide and the Weibull modulus was low. Applying the flaw size model in Field\n(1992), the strength-limiting flaw size is between 0.1 \u03bcm and 5 \u03bcm for the maximum and\nminimum measured strengths.\nTable 2: Strength of single crystal diamond measured using cantilever beam test.\nStrength, MPa\nWeibull Modulus, \u00b1 1\nDiamond\nSample Standard\nstandard error\nMean\nDeviation\nHPHT synthetic (15 samples) 1500 325\n5.2 \u00b1 0.2\nNatural type IIa (5 samples)\n2350 400\nNot calculated\nNatural type IIa (14 samples) 2790 1050\n2.48 \u00b1 0.10\nCVD synthetic (30 samples)\n2860 1200\n2.55 \u00b1 0.12\nIt is clear that whilst single crystal diamond can have a very high strength, its strength can be\ndegraded by the presence of flaws. The most likely source of flaws is believed to be from surface\nprocessing and subsequent handling of the material.\nTo date there have been no systematic studies of the strength of single crystal diamond as a\nfunction of nitrogen content.\n3.1.2 Polycrystalline Diamond. Suitably sized material is more readily available to perform\nstrength measurements on polycrystalline CVD diamond, but interpretation of the results remains\ncomplex.\nEarly measurements were made by subjecting thin membranes (between a few \u03bcm and about\n100 \u03bcm or so), to differential pressure with compressed gas and measuring the bursting stress\n(e.g. Cardinale and Robinson 1992). For films of comparable thickness, higher strengths were\nobserved with the nucleation surface in tension than with the growth surface in tension.\nValentine et al (1994) performed similar tests using diamond discs 200-300 \u03bcm thick and found\nthat for damond from the same synthesis run (and therefore produced presumably under the same\nconditions), higher strengths were measured with the nucleation surface in tension.\nA more wide-ranging study, which involved breaking several hundred samples using a threepoint bending geometry, has enabled the strength of a 'mechanical' grade and an 'optical' grade\nof polycrystalline CVD diamond to be evaluated as a function of thickness and a model\ndeveloped for the strength-limiting flaws in the material (Pickles 2002). The strength of\npolycrystalline diamond is limited by flaws that are typically the lateral size of the grains at the\n8\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\ntensile surface; flaws introduced by processing do not appear to play a significant role. The\nstrength is found to decrease with thickness with either the growth or nucleation surface in\ntension. However, the nucleation surface strength is largely independent of the synthesis process,\nwhereas there is a measurable difference for the growth surface. This is attributed to the different\nrates at which the grain size at the growth surface evolves with thickness. One consequence of\nthe strength limiting flaws being intrinsic to the material is that the strength of polycrystalline\nCVD diamond produced by a particular process is reasonably predictable, particularly when the\ngrowth surface is in tension. The range of strengths observed in high quality polycrystalline\ndiamond is summarized in table 3.\nTable 3: Strength of nominally 500 \u03bcm thick polycrystalline diamond measured using 3-point\nbend test (Pickles et al. 1999, Pickles 2002).\nStrength, MPa\nWeibull Modulus\nDiamond\nSample Standard\nMean\nDeviation\n6.5 \u00b1 0.2 (optical)\nNucleation side (all grades)\n1151\n236\n11 \u00b1 0.5 (mechanical)\nGrowth side (optical grade)\n557\n75\n23.1 \u00b1 0.5\nGrowth side (mechanical grade)\n735\n150\n11.3 \u00b1 0.5\n3.2 Diamond's wear properties\nThe high strength of the carbon to carbon bond is the source of the exceptional mechanical and\nwear properties of diamond. Dislocation of the atoms is difficult and consequently diamond is the\nhardest known substance on any measurable scale (table 4). Combining its wear properties with\nlow friction and high thermal conductivity makes diamond a very desirable material for cutting\ntool applications. Its high speed particle erosion resistance has been studied in detail by Davies\nand Field (2002) and Kennedy et al. (1999).\nTable 4. Hardness properties of diamond (Field 1992).\nProperty\nValue (GPa)\n{001} surface = 56 \u2013 102\nKnoop hardness (500 g load)\n{111} surface = 88\nVickers Hardness\n\nPolycrystalline = 85 \u2013 100\nSingle Crystal = 70 -100\n\nIn the authors' wear tests, turning on high silicon-aluminium alloys showed that the wear\nproperties vary for different types of diamond and also as a function of the primary cutting\norientation. Tools made using a {110} orientation showed lower wear than those with a {100}\nplane.\nComparing tools with a {110} orientation, it was found that SC CVD has around 20% and 45%\nhigher chip resistance respectively than natural type IIa and HPHT type Ib diamond. Abrasion\nresistance, in the steady state, was highest for {110} CVD and HPHT, with the CVD tools\nexhibiting roughly 60% higher wear resistance than natural type IIa.\nIt is not entirely clear why tools fabricated with {110} orientation are more wear resistant than\nthose fabricated from a {100} plane (figure 4), but it is thought to be associated with two factors:\n(i)\nThe ability to prepare a fine surface finish, free of damage which can promote\ncrack initiation, can vary from one diamond surface to another\n(ii)\nThe angle the cutting face makes with the hardest diamond wear direction <111>.\n\n9\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nWhile natural diamond samples can also show excellent performance, the variability in starting\nmaterial (table 5) is such that it can be very difficult to predict the exact performance, and no two\nnatural tools behave the same.\nTable 5.

Over recent years the\nmachining industry has seen an increasing demand for working with highly abrasive nonferrous\nmaterial and metal matrix composites, commonly used in the automotive and aerospace\nindustries. Diamond is an ideal material for machining these materials to the high tolerances and\nsurface finishes required. In addition diamond's high thermal conductivity and excellent thermal\noxidation resistance makes it suitable for both high speed and dry machining. Diamond cutting\ntool applications also include dressers for wheel dressing, speciality knives, burnishing tools, and\nwire drawing dies. CVD diamond can also be engineered to make it electrically conductive and\ntherefore making it cuttable using electrical discharge machining (EDM) (Collins 1998) so that\ntailored geometries are more easily attainable.\nCVD diamond's performance is increasing the range of industrial cutting applications diamond\ncan address. For example the lifetime of diamond water jet nozzles used for cutting nappies,\ncloth, paper, cardboard, frozen foods, semiconductors etc can be >100 hrs compared to tens of\nhours for more standard ruby or sapphire nozzles.\n3.3 Diamond used in acoustic applications\nCurrent commercial applications making use of the high stiffness of diamond include\nmicromechanical oscillators (Baldwin et al. 2006), surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices\n(Shikata 1998) and tweeter domes for loudspeakers. Diamond tweeter components were\nenvisaged and modelled as early as 1987 (Fujimori 1998). The ideal tweeter acts as a perfect\npiston, without deformation, at all frequencies. The upper limit to the frequency at which the\ndome behaves ideally is called the break-up frequency.\nWith standard materials, modified geometries, such as a 20% reduction in diameter, can\nsignificantly increase the break-up frequency. However these smaller units will be unable to\nachieve the sound pressure levels needed in high end audio systems. For a given geometry, the\nbreak up frequency depends on the material (table 6) and is proportional to the sound propogation\n\n10\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nvelocity. This velocity is proportional to E\n\n\u03c1 , where E is Young's modulus and \u03c1 the density;\n\ndiamond is expected to offer performance exceeding that of current materials by a factor of three.\nTable 6. Properties of materials used in acoustic applications.\nMaterial\nAluminium\nTitanium\nBeryllium\nDiamond\n\nE(GPa)\n71\n120\n318\n1000\n\n\u03c1(kg/m3)\n2700\n4500\n1850\n3500\n\n\u221a(E/\u03c1)\n5128\n5164\n13111\n16903\n\nRelative\n1.0\n1.0\n2.6\n3.3\n\nIn practice, a break-up frequency over 70 kHz has been achieved for diamond tweeters (figure 5),\ncompared to 30 kHz for high quality aluminium tweeters. Cone breakup modes are always\nassociated with a significant increase in harmonic and non-linear distortion, also with undesired\nlobing of sound pressure. In terms of sonic quality therefore cone breakup modes should be\npushed as far away as possible from the audible range to avoid any kind of subharmonic\ninterference, and hence the requirement on a high break-up frequency. For diamond to be viable\nfor consumer acoustic applications, a key issue has been the ability to grow non-planar, near net\nshape, very thin components in high volumes at a low cost. Diamond tweeters are now being\nused in significant volumes (www.bowers-wilkins.co.uk); when assembled as part of B&W\nloudspeakers, they have met with expert and consumer approval (Messenger 2005).\n4. Thermal properties and applications of diamond\nThe thermal conductivity of diamond is higher than any other material at room temperature, and\ncontributes significantly to its performance in a number of applications including windows for\nmulti-kilowatt CO2 lasers (Godfried et al. 2000), megawatt gyrotrons (Thumm 2007) and even\ncutting tools. Its high thermal conductivity is a factor in predicting favourable figures of merit for\nactive electronic devices (table 10) and optical components (table 8). A thermal conductivity of\n2000 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature exceeds that of copper by a factor of five. Even lower\ngrades with thermal conductivities of 1000 W m-1 K-1 exceed other competitor ceramics such as\naluminium nitride by a factor of four to six.\nThe main heat conduction mechanism for many materials is by electrons; high thermal\nconductivity is associated with high electrical conductivity. In diamond, lattice phonons provide\nthe main mechanism. Therefore any lattice defect acts to reduce its thermal conductivity by\nscattering phonons. Studies on isotopically controlled HPHT diamond grown by General Electric\nshowed that the presence of 13C at its natural abundance (1.1%) reduced the thermal conductivity\nby about 30%.\nAs an element used purely for thermal management, natural diamond was used in some early\nmicrowave and laser diode devices (Seal 1971, Doting and Molenaar 1988). However, the\navailability, size and cost of suitable natural diamond plates limited its penetration into that\nmarket. With the advent of polycrystalline CVD diamond with thermal properties similar to\nthose of type IIa natural diamond (figure 6) the availability problem was solved. Today, a range\nof thermal grades of diamond are available off the shelf from a number of sources. Since\npolycrystalline diamond is grown in large wafers, size is no longer limited to single devices or\nsmall arrays, but can extend to arrays many centimetres across. Consequently, CVD diamond has\nproven practical, being built into many devices from the 1990s onwards.\n\n11\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nTable 7. Properties of selected materials used in laser diodes (room temperature values). The\nranges for Diamond and AlN cover those available commercially. Data sources include Hudgins\n(2003)\nDiamond\n(polycrystalline)\nAlN\n(polycrystalline)\nGaAs\nGaN\n\nThermal conductivity\n(W m-1 K-1)\n\nCoefficient of thermal\nexpansion (ppm K-1)\n\nYoung's modulus (GPa)\n\n1000-2200\n\n0.9\n\n1100\n\n170-285\n\n4.2-5.3\n\n308\n\n55\n130\n\n5.7\n3.2-5.6\n\n86\n180\n\nWhile thermal pyrolitic graphite (TPG) offers in plane conductivities in the range 13501700 W m-1 K-1, its low through-plane conductivity (around 98% less than the in-plane value)\nreduces its ability to get heat away from the active area of devices. In comparison high quality\npolycrystalline CVD diamond has been shown to have a through plane conductivity varying by\nless than 10-20% of its in-plane value (Twitchen et al. 2001).\n4.1 Thermal integration considerations\nFor successful integration of a thermal management element into a device, the complete thermal\npath must be considered, along with the electrical requirements and thermally generated stresses.\nWhile diamond's extreme stiffness and low coefficient of thermal expansion are excellent for its\nuse in high power transmission windows, they tend to count against it in purely thermal\napplications as they are significantly different to those of commonly used compound semiconductors\n(table 7). Thermally induced stresses can lead to reductions in device lifetime and reliability\nunless they are managed by, for example, pre-cracking the compound semiconductor (Heinemann\net al. 1998) or using a diamond sandwich, where the upper layer acts to balance stresses.\nMost active electronics packages require an electrically insulating layer between any\nmetallisation and active cooling channels. Polycrystalline diamond is able to provide this with\nmeasured breakdown fields of 30-40 V/\u03bcm in commercial thermal grades (Element Six\nunpublished), and over 100 V/\u03bcm in research grades (Beuille et al. 2002).\nWhen integrating diamond into a device package, the ideal geometry depends on factors ranging\nfrom the power density through to the location of cooling channels. However, this is readily\nmodelled. For example, adding CVD diamond to the top of a microchannel cooled copper block\nreduces the device temperature rise from 22\u00b0C to 16\u00b0C as shown in figure 7. Varying the\ndiamond geometry on a simply cooled copper block for a laser diode array (peak power densities\nof 100 Wmm-2 at 200 \u03bcm spacing), suggested that the majority of the benefits occur with a\ndiamond thickness of around 300 \u03bcm and 3 mm width. It should be noted that comparison of\nmodelling with experimental results suggests that the metallisation is also an important\ncomponent in the thermal path. A typical metallisation would be Ti/Pt/Au, with a total thickness\nof 1000 nm (Hall 2009). As well as providing physical attachment and one electrical connection,\nthis provides intimate contact between heat source and heat spreader.\n4.2 Integrated thermal management for RF devices\nIt has long been recognized that the diamond layer should be as close as possible to the active\nregion of a high power device for the best performance. For example Touzelbaev and Goodson\n(1998) reported diamond deposition directly on a GaAs device. This approach has continued to\nconcentrate on low temperature deposition, primarily of nanodiamond (Xiao et al. 2004).\n\n12\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nDevices made in GaN have emerged as a technology of choice for next generation high power RF\ndevices. Research exploiting diamond layers for thermal management has developed into two\nmain areas: epitaxy-ready (111) composite silicon wafers with buried diamond layers (Zimmer\n2007) and direct bonding of GaN to diamond wafers (Felbinger et al. 2007). A third possibility\nof growing RF device grade GaN directly onto a diamond substrate has not yet been successful\n(Hageman et al. 2003).\nIntegration of diamond with silicon enables access to standard GaN growth techniques. High\nelectron mobility transistor (HEMT) devices manufactured using Group 4 Labs' material (figure\n7) have been reported to demonstrate a gate temperature rise half that of the equivalent device\nfabricated on SiC (Felbinger et al. 2007).\n\n5. Optical Properties\nDiamond exhibits a wide range of desirable optical properties which, when combined with its\nexcellent thermal properties, have led to a number of optical applications. Typically, but not\nexclusively, these involve high power laser technology such as CVD diamond beam exit windows\nin CO2 lasers (Godfried et al. 2000 and Massart 1996).\nThe optical properties of diamond have been comprehensively reviewed by Zaitsev (2001). Here\nwe consider those properties which are of particular practical interest, and review several\nemerging technologies.\n5.1 Absorption and scatter\nThe absorption coefficient for intrinsic diamond from the UV to long-wavelength IR is illustrated\nin figure 8 (reproduced from Collins (2001)). Wide spectral transparency can be seen, even\nextending to 500 \u03bcm (Dore et al. 1998) except for regions of absorption in the infra-red between\naround 2.5 to 6.5 \u03bcm (4000 to 1500 cm-1), and below the bandgap at around 226 nm (Dean 1965).\nOther infra-red transmitting materials, such as ZnS and ZnSe owe their transparency to heavy\natoms and weak bonds, resulting in low phonon energies and thus a cut-off frequency in the far\ninfra-red. Diamond with its low mass and rigid lattice possesses the highest fundamental phonon\n(absorption) frequency of any material, with the single phonon mode centred at 7.5 \u03bcm\n(1332.5 cm-1). While the lattice remains defect free, and thus symmetric, absorption at this\nfrequency is forbidden. The absorption in the infra-red is due to two- and three-phonon\nprocesses. These are temperature dependent (Mollart et al. 2001), and the absorption is\nsuccessfully described by the model developed by Piccirillo et al. (2002).\nRecent measurements of absorption by calorimetry at 1064 nm (Turri et al. 2007) yield values of\n0.003 to 0.07 cm-1 for single crystal CVD diamond, while the authors have found the absorption\ncoefficient at 10.6 \u03bcm to be between 0.02 and 0.05 cm-1 on both single and polycrystalline\nsamples (Whitehead 2003).\nPolycrystalline diamond causes significant Rayleigh scattering losses at wavelengths below\napproximately 1 \u03bcm (Sussmann 2000). Therefore single crystal diamond is generally required for\napplications in the UV to near IR. In high crystalline quality single crystal diamond, residual\nscattering losses are primarily due to surface roughness, ranging from 0.04 to 0.6% for 1064 nm\nphotons (Turri et al. 2007).\n\n13\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nRaman scattering in diamond results in a shift in energy equivalent to 1332 cm-1, with the Raman\nline width (a common metric of crystalline quality) less than 1.8 cm-1 in high quality samples\n(Zaitsev 2001).\n5.2 Dielectric properties of diamond\nFor light between the band gap up to 25 \u03bcm, the refractive index of diamond can largely be\ndescribed by the Sellmeier equation. Diamond has one of the highest refractive indices in the UV\npart of the spectrum with n = 2.60 at 266 nm, decreasing to n = 2.46 at 405 nm (Zaitsev 2001).\nAt microwave frequencies, as well as the refractive index, the dielectric loss factor (tan \u03b4) is\nimportant for high power transmission applications, e.g. as the output window of a gyrotron.\nThese parameters affect reflection and power absorption. Sussman (2000) discusses the specific\ncase for gyrotron tubes operating in the 70-170 GHz frequency range with output powers in\nexcess of 1 MW for fusion research. At 145 GHz, dielectric loss tangent values as low as (0.6 \u00b1\n0.5) \u00d710-5 have been reported on a 100 mm diameter polycrystalline CVD window (Heidinger et\nal. 1998). While this can be higher than for gold doped silicon and sapphire, diamond's dielectric\nproperties are relatively insensitive to temperature change. The combination of its properties\noffers the highest performance for high power microwave transmission at both room and liquid\nnitrogen temperatures.\n5.3 Luminescence\nThe luminescence spectrum of diamond is significantly altered by the incorporation of impurities\ninto the diamond lattice. Each type of defect can give rise to spectral features from the UV to the\nIR due to electronic and vibronic transitions. Indeed the huge range of defects means that optical\nspectroscopy of diamond is a very rich subject area (Wilks and Wilks 1991, Clark et al. 1992,\nZaitsev, 2001).\nBiological applications which involve fluorescence imaging are particularly sensitive to the\nluminescence of the CVD diamond (Rittweger et al. 2009). Two basic techniques can be used to\nproduce samples with low luminescence:\n(i)\n(ii)\n\nGrowth of diamond with very low defect uptake such as that required in electronic\napplications (section 7)\nUsing growth or post-growth damage techniques to create a very high concentration\nof defects which, through absorption, can minimize the diamond excitation volume,\nas well as producing non-radiative decay paths to quench the defect luminescence\n\nFor optical applications of CVD diamond the most important defect centres are arguably those\ndue to single substitutional nitrogen (Ns), nitrogen-vacancy (NV) complexes and dislocations.\nCVD diamond samples containing nitrogen typically exhibit a broad spectrum of orange-red\nluminescence under excitation. This NV-related luminescence is absent in very high purity CVD\ndiamond in which the residual blue luminescence, centred around 440 nm, is mainly associated\nwith dislocations.\n5.4 Birefringence and optical strain\nThere is growing demand to use CVD diamond where, in addition to its low absorption and high\nthermal conductivity, low birefringence is also required\nDue to its cubic lattice symmetry diamond is nominally an optically isotropic material: the\nrefractive index should be independent of the polarization of light. However, within the strain\nfield of a dislocation, or group of dislocations, the lattice is distorted. As such diamond typically\n\n14\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nexhibits a complex birefringence pattern determined by the density and spatial distribution of\ndislocations and other extended defects. For optical applications which are polarization-sensitive,\nany birefringence in an optical element leads to depolarization of the beam and subsequent losses.\nIn order to use diamond in these applications, low birefringence single crystal CVD diamond has\nbeen developed (Friel et al. 2009).\nGaukroger et al. (2008) discuss the relation between dislocation structures and CVD diamond\ngrowth, and some methods by which their density can be reduced. Figure 9 gives an example of\nthe birefringence of two CVD samples with relatively high and low dislocation densities. It can\nbe seen that the birefringence is reduced from, in this case, \u2264 1.2\u00d710-5 to \u2264 3\u00d710-6 by reducing the\ndislocation density in the material. Through the use of carefully selected and processed\nsubstrates, and the use of optimized growth conditions, birefringence \u2264 5\u00d710-7 has been reported\n(Friel et al. 2009).\nIt should be noted that polycrystalline diamond cannot be used for low birefringence applications\ndue to the stresses between grains.\n5.5 Emerging optical applications based on single crystal CVD diamond\nThe development of low birefringence CVD diamond has led to improvements in the\nperformance of doped dielectric and semiconductor disk lasers. It has been shown that diamond\nheat spreaders bonded to the pumped surface of doped dielectric gain crystals allow pump power\ndensities to be employed, and hence output powers achieved, that would otherwise cause the laser\ncrystals to fracture (Millar et al. 2009). Intra-cavity diamond heat spreaders have also proven to\nbe vital in realising the spectral coverage promised by semiconductor disk lasers at watt-level\npowers (Kemp et al. 2008). In particular, Hopkins et al. (2008) used this approach to improve\noutput power by more than two orders of magnitude in the technologically important 2 - 2.5 \u03bcm\nband.\nIn contrast to either natural or high birefringence synthetic diamond, Millar et al. (2008)\ndemonstrated that low birefringence diamond led to much lower depolarization losses. Single\ncrystal CVD diamond is therefore a viable option for thermal management in laser systems of this\nkind.\nAnother area of recent development enabled by the availability of good optical quality, large area\nCVD diamond, is the use of diamond in Raman lasers as reported by Mildren et al. (2008). Here\ndiamond is used as the active laser medium \u2013 the incident pump light is Raman-scattered to a new\nwavelength, whereby this scattered light is amplified (typically within a cavity) by the third-order\nnonlinear optical process of stimulated Raman scattering.\nTable 8: Characteristics of selected Raman crystals. Kemp's figure of merit indicating resistance\nto thermal lensing (Kemp et al., 2009) calculated using 8 mm low birefringence path length for\ndiamond (Friel et al. 2009) and 25 mm for other materials.\nMaterial\nRaman Gain (cm/GW)\nRaman Shift (cm-1)\nThermal Conductivity (W/m.K)\nThermal Lensing Figure of\nMerit (for 1 \u03bcm light)\n\nDiamond\n~15\n1332\n2000\n\nKGW\n~4\n901\n~3\n\nYVO4\n5\n892\n5.2\n\nBa(NO3)2\n11\n1047\n1.2\n\n1440\n\n3\n\n20\n\n1\n\nThe attraction of diamond as a Raman gain crystal can be seen in table 8, despite the\ncomparatively limited sizes of diamond available. The figure of merit for diamond is around two\n\n15\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\norders of magnitude higher than for conventional Raman crystals, largely due to its thermal\nconductivity. It also offers the largest wavelength shift.\nThe current record output power for a CW intracavity Raman laser (3W using KGW) is limited\nby the onset of excessive thermal lensing. The use of diamond, with its higher resistance to\nthermal lensing, may permit scaling into the tens of watts range.\n5.6 Diamond Processing\nIn addition to the improvements in material quality for optical applications, developments in the\nprocessing and etching of diamond have opened up the possibility of fabricating structures in\ndiamond such as micro-lenses (figure 10), gratings, waveguides or cavity resonators. Unlike\nother processes such as focussed ion-beam milling, etching using inductively-coupled plasmas is\nthought not to damage the diamond surface and sub-surface regions. Unlike typical oxygenbased plasmas, the argon-chlorine based plasma (Lee et al. 2008) has also been shown not to\npreferentially etch defects such as dislocations, and thus avoids the formation of undesirable etch\npits.\n6. Electronic properties and applications\nDiamond is a wide bandgap semiconductor with an indirect gap of about 5.47 eV. One of the\nbenefits of this is that diamond can support high electric fields before breakdown. Experiments\non high purity CVD diamond have reported high mobility values and long lifetimes for electrons\nand holes. Combined with the high thermal conductivity, diamond can be the preferred material\nfor a number of demanding electronic applications.\n6.1 Carrier properties\n6.1.1 Intrinsic diamond. The concentration of electrons in the conduction band of an intrinsic\nsemiconductor, assuming a mid-bandgap Fermi level, is approximately n = Nc exp[Eg/(2kBT)],\nwhere Nc is the effective density of states in the conduction band, Eg is the energy gap, kB is\nBoltzmann's constant and T is temperature. At room temperature Nc ~ 2 \u00d7 1019 cm-3 (Nebel and\nStutzmann 2000) and n is very much less than one electron per km3. As perfect diamond has not\nyet been grown, the electronic properties will always be governed by impurities such as nitrogen\nand boron, and structural defects including dislocations and grain boundaries.\nHigh carrier mobility in high purity intrinsic CVD diamond was first reported in 2002 by Isberg\net al.. Recently, a number of other research groups have reported intrinsic CVD diamond with\nunintentional defect density around or below the parts per billion level (~1014 cm-3) (Secroun et\nal. 2007). In the high carrier injection regime (Q>CV, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance\nand V is the voltage), the mobility decreases with a T-3/2 dependence consistent with acoustic\nphonon scattering up to temperatures ~400 K. At higher temperatures, it shows a ~T-3.7\ndependence consistent with measurements on natural diamond. At room temperature a hole\nmobility of 3800(\u00b1400) cm2V-1s-1 was observed. Even at 400 K the mobility still exceeds\n2000 cm2V-1s-1 (Isberg et al. 2002).\nThe combined electron and hole room temperature mobility for a number of electronic materials\nis plotted against bandgap in figure 11. Diamond's unique position is apparent, especially when\nthermal conductivity (indicated by the area of the circle) is considered.\nDiamond's low relative permittivity and large bandgap combine to predict a widely quoted\nbreakdown field of 1000 V/\u03bcm. Breakdown voltage measurements have been performed for\nSchottky diodes. For lateral diode structures, a breakdown voltage of 6 kV has been attained\nusing a wide contact spacing (Butler et al. 2003) and up to 66 V for micron-scale separation\n\n16\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\ndevices. This second result corresponds to a simply calculated 146 V/\u03bcm breakdown field (Teraji\net al. 2007). In vertical device structures, 2.5 kV breakdown has been reported for 18 \u03bcm\nthickness of intrinsic diamond (140 V/\u03bcm) (Twitchen et al. 2004). Others have also achieved\nbreakdown fields of this magnitude (Huang et al. 2005, Kumaresan et al. 2009). Twitchen et al.\n(2004) reported 400 V/\u03bcm for a pressure contact; the authors have recently attained 450 V/\u03bcm in\na vertical device structure (unpublished).\n6.1.2 Doped diamond. As a dopant in silicon, boron provides an acceptor level 0.045 eV above\nthe valence band. Dopants in wide bandgap semiconductors tend to have higher ionisation\nenergies, resulting in low activation at room temperature. For example, 4H-SiC has shallow\ndonors (n-dopant), but lacks a really shallow acceptor (p-dopant), the shallowest being aluminium\nwith an ionisation energy of 0.19 eV (Ikeda et al. 1980). In the case of diamond, the range of\ndopants is limited, partly by its tight lattice spacing, and all have even higher ionisation energies\n(table 9).\nWhile boron and phosphorus have been considered for high temperature applications (Kohn et al.\n2004) and in pn junction UV diodes (Koizumi et al. 2001), their levels are too deep for\nconventional room temperature applications. Nitrogen is even deeper, so research has focused on\nunipolar devices using boron. However for boron to be active at room temperature its\nconcentration must be pushed to very high levels, typically >1020 cm-3. As the concentration\nincreases the conduction mechanism changes, first from band type conduction to hopping, then to\nmetallic-like with the activation energy approaching zero (Borst and Weiss 1996, Lagrange et al.\n1998). At the same time, the presence of compensating donors (shallow or deep) must be\nminimized.\nTable 9. Common doping impurities introduced into synthetic diamond.\nElement\nActivation Energy (eV)\nNitrogen\n1.7\nN-type\nPhosphorous 0.6 (Koizumi et al. 1997)\nP-type\nBoron\n0.37 (Collins et al. 1965)\nReports claiming that sulphur (S) or oxygen (O) constitute reasonably shallow donors remain to\nbe substantiated at the time of writing. A boron-hydrogen complex has also recently been\nreported to constitute a reasonably shallow n-dopant (Chevallier et al. 2002), but the long-term\nstability of this complex is uncertain. Goss et al. (2004) have performed a theoretical analysis of\npotential diamond dopants.\nImplantation techniques to introduce dopants into diamond have had limited success (Prins 2003,\nKalish 2003). Diamond's metastable properties at room temperature and pressure mean than\nimplantation creates damaged or graphitic regions. While post implantation annealing can\nremove the majority of this damage, it cannot restore the diamond to a perfect lattice.\n6.2 Electrical contacts to diamond\nFor diamond to be used as a semiconductor in devices, high quality contacts are required. Most\nmetal contacts to semiconductors are non-ohmic due to surface depletion. The most common\nmethod used to achieve ohmic behaviour is to increase the doping concentration, and this has\nbeen employed in diamond. This has the effect of reducing the depletion width and hence the\ncontact resistance by increasing tunnelling through the Schottky barrier. It has been found that by\nusing carbide-forming metals (such as Mo, Ta, Ti) in combination with annealing, it is possible to\nmake ohmic contacts to p-type diamond (Hewett and Zeidler 1992, Tachibana et al. 1992) with\nspecific contact resistance as low as ~10-7 \u03a9 cm2 (Werner et al. 1996). This is thought to be due\n\n17\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nto enhanced conduction through areas in which metal-carbide formation has occurred. Ohmic\ncontacts to n-type diamond have been much more difficult to realize. Kato et al. (2009) reported\nTi contacts to heavily phosphorus-doped diamond films ([P] ~1020 cm-3) that, although non-ideal,\nexhibited contact resistances down to 10-3 \u03a9 cm2.\nSchottky contacts to diamond have been fabricated using both non-carbide forming (e.g. Al, Pt)\nand carbide forming metals, although the latter metals should not be annealed. Metal contacts to\nH-terminated electronic surface devices such as surface field-effect transistors often use Al for\nthe gate and Au for the source and drain (Ueda et al. 2006). A more in-depth review of electrical\ncontacts to diamond, including a consideration of the importance of diamond surface termination\non the Schottky barrier height, is given by Werner et al. (2003).\n6.3 Diamond electronics \u2013 applications and markets\nSi and GaAs devices dominate the solid-state microwave device market today, however they have\nnot yet been able to replace vacuum tubes in many high power applications. These tubes, such as\nklystrons and travelling-wave tubes (TWTs), are usually bulky, fragile and expensive. Wide\nbandgap materials (SiC, GaN, Diamond) may have the potential to replace TWT technology, in\ncertain applications.\nA further potential use of diamond is to control power at high voltages. A single diamond switch\ncan in theory be used to switch power at voltages approaching 50 kV. This is not achievable with\nany other electronic material. If realized, electronic devices made from diamond could drastically\nreduce the size and cost of electronic control nodes, needed for active power grids.\nTable 10. Material properties and figures of merit (normalized to Si) at room temperature for Si,\n4H-SiC, GaN and diamond. 4H is the polytype of SiC that is considered best suited for power\nelectronic devices (highest mobility). The diamond values are those reported for research grade\nsingle crystal CVD diamond in the space charge limited regime (Isberg et al. 2002). JFM is a\nmeasure of the high frequency capability of the material and KFM provides a thermal limitation\nto the switching behavior of transistors. High figures of merit do not mean that it will be\nstraightforward to achieve these in practice.\nBand-gap (eV)\nBreakdown Field (MVcm-1)\nElectron Mobility (cm2V-1s-1)\nHole Mobility (cm2V-1s-1)\nThermal Conductivity (Wcm-1K-1)\nJohnson's Figure of Merit (JFM)\nKeyes' Figure of Merit (KFM)\n\nSi\n1.1\n0.3\n1450\n480\n1.5\n1\n1\n\n4H-SiC\n3.2\n3\n900\n120\n5\n410\n5.1\n\nGaN\n3.44\n5\n440\n200\n1.3\n280\n1.8\n\nDiamond\n5.47\n10\n4500\n3800\n24\n8200\n32\n\n6.4 High power high frequency devices\nDue to physical limitations, silicon and gallium arsenide devices cannot achieve power levels\nabove a few hundred watts (depending on the frequency to be amplified). Diamond, in principle,\nallows for higher power output per unit gate length at microwave frequencies. This is because a\nlarger bias voltage, and hence the voltage amplitude on the microwave signal, can be supported\nacross the transistor channel region over which the current is modulated.\nThe high ionisation energy of boron doped diamond means conventional device designs cannot\nautomatically be expected to work well for diamond. One of the advantages of diamond is that\nthe drift velocity of charge carriers reaches saturation at relatively low fields. This property may\n\n18\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nbest be exploited by separating carriers from ionized acceptors (6.4.1), or by taking advantage of\nthe surface conduction seen with hydrogen terminated surfaces (6.4.2).\n6.4.1 Bulk device structures. The p-i-p MISFET (metal-insulator field effect transistor) (figure\n12a) was pioneered by Kobe Steel (Koizumi et al. 2002). A trench is etched through the B-doped\nconducting channel; subsequently the gate dielectric and metal are deposited. The current that\nflows around the gate is space-charge limited, which is not ideal for a high power transistor.\nFurthermore, successful operation requires very precise etching of the gate trench with nanometre\ncontrol as the source-drain current is highly sensitive to the effective gate length (Leff).\nA more attractive design is shown in figure 12b which separates the holes and ionized acceptors\nby incorporating a 'delta' doping layer (a technique pioneered in silicon and commonly used in\nIII-V devices). The delta layer is a very thin highly boron doped region which acts as a source of\nholes. Carriers can diffuse from the delta layer, with an expected mobility of around\n10 cm2 V-1 s-1, and conduct travelling in the intrinsic layer, where mobilities in excess of\n1000 cm2 V-1 s-1 are possible. An enhanced variant of the single-delta MESFET (metal\nsemiconductor field effect transistor) is the double-delta MESFET (figure 12c), where the\nadditional delta-layer is deposited primarily to improve the source and drain contacts. Recently,\nthe University of Ulm demonstrated a diamond MESFET, incorporating a single delta-layer\n(figure 12b), that could operate at frequencies above 1 GHz (El-Hajj et al. 2008). Diamond\nMicrowave Devices Ltd. are working to commercialize devices of this type.\n6.4.2 Surface Conduction FET. An alternative design is based on transfer doping on the H\nterminated diamond surface. Hydrogen surface termination causes a 2D hole channel to form in\nthe diamond layer several nanometres below the surface. It is believed that atmospheric\ncontamination, especially condensation of water vapour onto the hydrogenated surface, plays a\nkey role in creating the conductive channel below the surface (Ristein et al. 2008). During FET\noperation, holes travel through this channel from the source contact to the drain contact near the\nsurface. The gate voltage modulates the hole conduction, making FET operation possible.\nImpressive results have been reported by several groups with headline figures including an output\npower density of 2.1 Wmm-1 cw at 1 GHz (Kasu et al. 2007) and ft = 45 GHz (unitary gain cut-off\nfrequency) and fmax = 120 GHz (max frequency for operation) (Ueda et al. 2006). Although these\nresults are promising, the long term stability of these surface FETs remains an issue, particularly\nat elevated temperatures and in harsh environments.\n6.5 Summary\nTo realize the significant potential of diamond in devices outperforming existing technology will\nrequire: (i) access in volume to high quality, high purity, single crystal material;\n(ii) improvements in controlled doping; and (iii) the ability to process and contact thin layers and\nstructures.\nAccess to bulk single crystal diamond for electronic R&D activities has already been largely\nachieved (Lohstroh et al. 2007 , Secroun et al. 2007, Nesladek et al. 2008). Diamond Detectors\nLtd. are commercially exploiting Element Six material for detector applications (next section).\nDopants in diamond remain deeper than would be ideal, however it is anticipated that this can be\novercome using smart designs. Substantial progress has been made in developing CVD synthesis\nto fabricate these designs, and the recent achievement of operating frequencies above 1 GHz is\nextremely encouraging.\n7. Passive electronics\n\n19\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nDiamond's role in passive electronics is primarily as a radiation detector. It excels in niche\napplications where volume sensitivity, radiation hardness and/or temperature insensitivity are\nrequired. In contrast to many other solid state radiation detectors, which use reverse biased\ndiodes, high purity intrinsic diamond is able to act as a solid state ionisation chamber at room\ntemperature. In order to do this charge must be able to travel freely through the lattice. The key\nto this is purity and crystalline quality.\nDiamond's radiation hardness arises from its high atomic displacement energy (42 eV/atom) and\nlow atomic number. It can demonstrate high sensitivity to radiation in comparison to other solid\nstate detectors despite its relatively high electron-hole pair creation energy (13.2 eV, c.f. 3.6 eV\nfor Si) because other detectors may have been intentionally radiation damaged to improve their\neffective radiation hardness (i.e. the stability of signal with time) (Buttar et al. 2000). In\ncomparison to gaseous ionisation chambers, diamond's atomic density is of order 1000 times\nhigher and therefore offers significant potential for miniaturisation. Since it has a large bandgap\n(indirect, 5.47 eV) it can demonstrate low leakage current, due to a low intrinsic carrier fraction,\nat room or even elevated temperatures. 5.47 eV is the energy of a 226 nm photon, therefore\ndevices made using intrinsic diamond can be insensitive to visible light.\n7.1 Development of detectors\n7.1.1 High energy physics. In the early 1990s, the potential of CVD diamond as a radiation\ndetector was explored, and compared to that of selected natural IIa diamonds. Early\npolycrystalline films achieved sufficiently high resistivity to be tested at fields in the region of\n1 V/\u03bcm, and achieved mean carrier collection distances (CCDs) between 1 and 45 micron (Pan et\nal. 1992, 1993, Plano et al. 1994). Significant progress was made starting later that decade with\nthe CERN RD42 group, concentrating on detection of ionizing particles for the high flux\nenvironment of the Large Hadron Colider (LHC). Ten years' work resulted in strip and pixel\ndevices being manufactured on polycrystalline material 20 mm by 60 mm with a CCD of 300 \u03bcm\n(Adam et al. 2003, Wallny 2007).\nOther high energy physics experiments such as BaBar at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,\nJoint European Torus (JET), National Ignition Facility (NIF) at LLNL and Gesellschaft fuer\nSchwerionenforschung (GSI) have worked to develop diamond detectors. BaBar was an early\nuser of diamond as a beam condition monitor (BCM) (Bruinsma et al. 2006). The role of a BCM\nis to reliably provide rapid beam abort signals in the event of beam instability and therefore\nprotect other detectors from receiving damaging doses of radiation. The desired properties of a\nBCM are fast response (<2 ns pulse FWHM) and radiation hardness, which can be fulfilled in\npieces of polycrystalline diamond approximately 10 \u00d7 10 mm2(Pernegger et al. 2004). Since\nBaBar, diamond BCMs have been installed in the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC\n(Chong et al. 2007).\nJET and LLNL are both fusion experiments and have worked to develop neutron detectors,\nsometimes with stringent timing requirements (Lattanzi et al. 2009, Schmid et al. 2003). As\nthese are measurements on fast neutrons (MeV energies), the measurement can be made directly\nin diamond due to 12C(n, \u03b1)9Be reactions (Angelone et al. 2006). Absorption of the resulting \u03b1\nparticle induces a charge that can be detected once it has drifted to the electrodes.\nIf the detection of thermal neutrons (tens of meV) is desired, thin layers of 6Li (usually in the\nform of 6LiF), 10B (as free-standing boron or boron doped diamond) or 235U can be applied as\nconverter layers (Almaviva et al. 2008, Lardon et al. 2006).\n\n20\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\n7.1.2 Measures of quality. Electronic grade polycrystalline diamond achieving a CCD of\n250 \u03bcm will typically be 500 \u03bcm thick (Pernegger 2006). An alternative measure for radiation\ndetectors is charge collection efficiency (CCE).\n\nCCE =\n\nCCD\nthickness\n\nCCE for the highest quality polycrystalline detector grade samples is therefore approximately\n50%. More recently, high purity single crystal CVD diamond has been tested in detector\napplications (table 11). For this, the CCE can approach 100% for samples up to 800 \u03bcm thick\n(Pernegger 2006). This can occur because of a lack of traps, which therefore opens up\npossibilities of high resolution particle energy spectroscopy.\nTable 11.

GSI are primarily interested in detection and analysis of heavy ion\nfragments, and have worked to develop detectors demonstrating fast signals, with high energy\nresolution, suitable for extreme radiation environments (figure 13). Testing single crystal\ndiamond as a spectrometer, the FWHM measured for 5.5 MeV \u03b1 particles was measured to be\n17 keV, compared to 14 keV using a Si p-i-n diode. This corresponds to an energy resolution of\n0.3% (Pomorski et al. 2006, Berdermann et al. 2008). These authors also demonstrated a timing\nresolution of 28 ps (one standard deviation for the correlation between two detector responses) for\nboth polycrystalline and single crystal diamond.\nNeutron spectroscopy measurements for fast 14 MeV neutrons have also been demonstrated\n(Schmid et al. 2004). An initial device measured an energy width of 240 keV for the 8.4 MeV \u03b1\nparticles produced, a FWHM of 2.9%. However most of this width was attributed to the energy\nspread of the incident neutrons.\n7.1.4 Further uses. Diamond can also be used to detect ionising radiation, such as x-rays and\nultraviolet light. Similarly to \u03b1 particles, sub-bandgap UV light has a short penetration depth into\ndiamond and can be efficiently detected using thin devices, possibly with a surface electrode\nconfiguration. X-ray detection is due to volume excitation. Examples include quadrant detectors\nfor synchrotron beam position measurement (Morse et al. 2007, Bergonzo et al. 2006) and\nmedical radiotherapy dosimeters (Whitehead et al. 2001, Cirrone et al. 2006, Tranchant et al.\n2008). UV detection has been studied for LYRA/BOLD (BenMoussa A et al. 2008).\nDiamond can also be used in a similar manner to another important class of detectors,\nscintillators. In some extreme fluence environments such as synchrotron beams, the heat load can\nreadily exceed the capabilities of traditional materials. Diamond's high thermal conductivity and\nknown photoluminescence defects enable its use as a fluorescence detector in these circumstances\n21\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\n(Bergonzo et al. 2006, Nam and Rijn 1992). Separately, controlled levels of defects within\ndiamond can be used to give simple methods of integrating the radiation dose over time through\nthermal luminescence dosimetry (Marczewska et al. 2006).\n7.2 Effects of imperfections\nSince passive electronic detectors rely on transport and collection of electrons and holes, the\nnature and types of defect present strongly affect how well they work. The device performance\ndepends on defects in the bulk and near the surface and electrical contacts.\nAssuming high quality diamond growth, the surface defects are dominated by damage remaining\ndue to surface processing. For most devices, the as-grown surface is either too rough\n(polycrystalline diamond) or still has a low grade substrate attached (single crystal devices) and\nwill therefore require mechanical processing. However, while flatness of the final surface can be\nimportant to enable, for example, high spatial resolution, the flattest surface is not necessarily the\nbest quality with regard to sub-surface damage. Post-processing etching has been developed and\nshows promise for some applications.\nEstablishing high quality contacts to the diamond is also important. Repeated re-contacting of the\nsame diamond device has shown that significant variations in performance can occur, for the\nsame contact recipe. Evaporated gold can work well in many circumstances but, in the authors'\nexperience, can suffer from low mechanical adhesion and thus poor longevity. Other successful\nschemes include layers with carbide formers such as Cr or Ti, and one type of DLC developed by\nDiamond Detectors Ltd. (Galbiati A et al. 2009).\nFor many polycrystalline diamond detectors, \"priming\" has been shown to improve the device\nperformance. This can be with x-rays or electrons - any radiation that creates charge carriers\nthroughout the bulk of the diamond and can therefore fill all active traps (Pernegger 2006).\nWhile the grain boundaries are the most obvious defect, and have been correlated with reducing\nthe CCE (Adam et al. 2003), the precise nature of traps filled (or de-activated) by priming has not\nbeen determined.\n7.2.1 Radiation hardness. Once low defect diamond has been grown and carefully processed,\nnew defects can be created by radiation damage during use. Studies of device performance\nversus proton and neutron dose have been performed, including by RD42 for CERN/LHC,\ndemonstrating its suitability for that extreme environment. These data and other studies covering\na range of irradiation energies are summarized in table 12.\nTable 12.

It predicts a decrease in NIEL by two orders of\nmagnitude, and thus an increase in radiation hardness, as the proton energy is increased between\n10 and 104 MeV. For neutrons, calculations show significantly lower energy deposition due to\nthe reduction of charged particle induced damage, with a smaller energy dependence (less than\none order of magnitude over the range 10 to 104 MeV).\nWhen designing for radiation hardness with lower incident energies (<10 MeV) it is important to\nconsider where the energy is deposited. For lower proton energies, all particles are stopped\nwithin the detector. For example, 2.6 MeV protons only have a range of 40 \u03bcm, with most\ndamage occurring very close to that depth. Even though the damaged region is very small, it can\nstop the device functioning effectively (Lohstroh et al. 2008). For neutrons with energies in the\nrange 1-20 MeV the onset of inelastic reactions, such as 12C(n, \u03b1)9Be, as the energy increases,\nneeds to be considered (Angelone et al. 2006). These reactions can provide another path for\nradiation damage to occur.\nTo date, recovering the performance of devices following irradiation has been confined to\npriming, akin to that used with polycrystalline diamond. The authors are not aware of published\ndata on the nature of the defects, or their response to annealing.\n8. Electrochemical properties and applications of diamond\nIn the field of electrochemistry, highly boron doped diamond has been used in electroanalysis and\nbulk oxidation of dissolved species in solution. Its chemical inertness, resistance to fouling and\nlarge potential window in aqueous solution make it a unique electrode material.\n8.1 Chemical inertness of diamond\nDiamond is extremely resistant to oxidation and attack by acids, even at elevated temperatures.\nUnlike nearly all other electrode materials, diamond is also resistant to attack by hydrofluoric\nacid. Platinum electrodes have been used for generating oxidising species in HF solutions for the\netching of silicon in the absence of nitric acid. However, the solution eventually becomes\ncontaminated with trace amounts of platinum, which in turn can contaminate the silicon surface.\nReplacing the platinum electrode with a diamond electrode has removed this contamination\nproblem and in some cases the diamond electrode has been used to measure the extent of any\ncontamination in the HF solution (Ponnuswamy et al. 2001).\nWhilst the bulk of the diamond is inert the surface of the diamond can be altered. Upon removal\nfrom a CVD reactor the surface of diamond is hydrogen terminated and therefore hydrophobic.\nUnder anodic operation (operation at positive voltages) in aqueous solution, this diamond surface\nrapidly transforms from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, becoming oxygen terminated.\n8.2 Resistance of diamond electrodes to fouling\nSome organic chemicals such as phenol have the ability to react with metal electrodes, resulting\nin the electrode surface becoming inactive. This is termed as 'fouling'. Diamond is thought to be\nmuch less prone to fouling (Hagans et al. 2001), although other authors note that de-activation\ndue to fouling of the diamond does occur, unless the diamond anode is periodically run at a high\npotential (E > 2.3 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)). Changing the polarity of the\nelectrodes periodically can also prevent build up of foreign material on the diamond surface\n(Haenni et al. 2004).\nShould the diamond surface become fouled in an industrial application, an acid flush can be used\nto re-activate the surface without degrading the diamond electrodes. In electroanalysis, where the\n\n23\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nelectrode is more easily removed from the system, the electrode surface can be re-activated by\npolishing. There is little risk of damaging the electrode surface whichever abrasive is used.\n8.3 Large potential window of diamond electrodes\nWhether an electrode is used for electroanalysis or bulk oxidation of contaminants in solution, the\npotential which can be applied before electrolysis of the electrolyte/solvent occurs is an important\nproperty. Since most electrochemistry is performed in aqueous solution this corresponds to the\npotentials at which water is electrolysed into hydrogen gas (at the negatively charged cathode)\nand oxygen gas (at the positively charged anode).\nMany groups have reported diamond electrodes with a large potential window for water stability\nand featureless background currents within this window (Swain and Ramesham 1993, Swain\n1994a,b, Alehashem et al. 1995, Awada et al. 1995, Martin et al. 1999, Argoitia et al. 1996,\nMartin et al. 1995). Figure 14 shows a typical cyclic voltammogram for high quality boron\ndoped diamond, with the flat region extending from approximately -1.35 V to +2.3 V.\nIn the case of electronanalysis the wider window may allow new systems to be investigated or\nnew species to be detected. The low background currents within the window enable greater\nsensitivity than for metals such as platinum. In the case of bulk oxidation driving the system at\nhigher potentials allows reactions to occur at higher rates (Carey et al. 1995).\nDiamond remains inert in all known organic solvents and has been reported to display a similar\npotential window to that of glassy carbon in many (Yoshimura et al. 2002).\nIf significant amounts of sp2 carbon are present in the film i.e. it is of poor quality, the potential\nwindow is significantly reduced, becoming similar to that of glassy carbon or highly oriented\npyrolitic graphite (HOPG). There are also reports of polycrystalline diamond electrodes with\nlarge amounts of sp2 carbon in the grain boundaries eventually disintegrating under anodic\npolarization (large positive voltages) (Angus et al. 2004).\n8.4 Diamond electrodes for electroanalysis\nAs discussed in the review by Swain (2004), important characteristics in electroanalytical\napplications are the linear dynamic range, sensitivity, lower limit of detection, response time,\nresponse precision and response stability.\nTwo problems with sp2 carbon electrodes, such as glassy carbon, are the stabilization time and the\nshort and long term signal stability. Typically glassy carbon takes an initial 15-60 minutes to\nstabilize whereas diamond is usually in the 1-5 minute range. At potentials used for detection of\nredox species the surface of glassy carbon gradually oxidizes leading to an unstable background\nsignal. For diamond, after the initial transformation to an oxygen terminated surface, the\nmicrostructure is extremely stable, giving very stable, low background currents.\nDiamond has also an advantage over most other electrode materials for sensing in aggressive or\ncorrosive environments.\nTo reduce background currents further, the surface area of the electrode should be reduced. If a\nmicroelectrode with a radius of only a few microns is used, diffusion to the electrode surface is no\nlonger planar but hemispherical. This results in higher mass transfer rates to the electrode surface\nand faster response times (Forster 1994). A microelectrode array can increase the signal whilst\nstill maintaining the advantages of the microelectrode.\n\n24\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nColley et al. (2006) have characterized microelectrode arrays manufactured entirely from\ndiamond (figure 15). Being an all diamond structure, rather than having different material for the\ninsulator, enables truly co-planar microdisk electrodes. It can also be cleaned with abrasives\nwithout producing any change in its structure.\nMany papers have shown a variable response from diamond electrodes when used as\nelectrochemical sensors. However Wilson et al. (2006) emphasize that high quality electrical\ncontacts to the boron doped diamond are required to obtain repeatable results.\n8.5 Diamond electrodes for advanced oxidation\nSeveral organisations, including CONDIAS and CSEM are selling diamond electrodes for\nelectrochemical water treatment. The majority of these electrodes consist of a thin coating of\nboron doped diamond (typically a few microns) on an electrically conductive substrate such as\nrefractory metals (e.g. tungsten, molybdenum or tantalum) or a conductive ceramic (e.g. doped\nsilicon or electrically conductive silicon carbide).\nAnother approach is to use thick, freestanding, boron doped diamond discs (see figure 16).\nUnlike diamond coatings they do not suffer from degradation due to pin holes. Such discs have\nbeen used in a system produced by Advanced Oxidation Limited (AOL).\nFigure 16 shows results from a landfill leachate treated with the AOL reactor. Both the ammonia\nand the chemical oxygen demand (COD) are oxidized and the solution quickly becomes\ncolourless.\nExactly what oxidants are produced in aqueous solution when a large potential is applied to\ndiamond electrodes is not well known. Even less is know about the mechanism by which these\noxidants are formed. However, it is believed that diamond electrodes produce a mixture of\noxidants such as OH* (hydroxyl radicals), ozone and hydrogen peroxide.\nAdvanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are those using OH* as a strong oxidant. With an\nelectrochemical oxidation potential of 2.80 V, OH* is only weaker than fluorine (3.06 V). It is\nsignificantly stronger than other oxidants such as ozone (2.08 V) and the hypochlorite ion\n(1.49 V).\nThe second order rate constants for reaction of hydroxyl radicals with most organic compounds\nare of the order 108 to 109 l mole-1 s-1. This is of the same order as acid-base reactions, which are\nconsidered to be one of the fastest reactions in solution.\nAdvanced oxidation processes are normally only applied to low COD wastewaters because of the\ncost of producing hydroxyl radicals. However, it may not be necessary to oxidize the COD\ncompletely. For example, material that was previously resistant to biological degradation can be\ntreated with an AOP and then re-processed by biological means (Tchobanoglous et al. 2004,\nCrittenden et al. 2005).\nThe efficiency of AOPs can be affected by the presence of suspended solids and the pH of the\nwastewater. Also, high concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate ions in the solution being\ntreated cause a significant reduction in the amount of organic material being destroyed, due to\nunfavourable rate constants (Tchobanoglous et al. 2004, Crittenden et al. 2005).\n8.6 The future of diamond electrodes.\n\n25\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nThe properties of diamond as an electrode clearly show that it is a unique material. The stability\nof the diamond surface, its chemical inertness and the ability to apply large potentials before the\nelectrolysis of water occurs are all factors in favour of selecting diamond as an electrode material.\nMost electrochemical synthesis and processing applications demand high volume capability and\nhigh reaction rates, in turn requiring large area electrodes operating in very aggressive chemical\nenvironments. Diamond is unparalleled in its ability to survive such environments without\nerosion, and at the same time reduce the process cost. Trends in legislation are continually\nreducing the permitted levels of harmful chemicals in effluent, and CVD diamond electrodes\noffer promising solutions to these new challenges.\nElectroanalysis applications have different requirements to those of chemical synthesis and\nprocessing: the key requirements are generally sensitivity and stability. Typical industries which\nmight use electroanalysis such as the medical, pharmaceutical or bioscience sectors are currently\ngrowth areas where a new material can quickly establish itself if a novel use is found. In fact, the\nbiocompatibility of diamond has already led to a novel use, for in vitro measurements of\nneurotransmitter levels, electrical activity and also for neural stimulation (Halpern et al. 2006).\n\n9. Summary and outlook\nDiamond is a unique material with many properties that cannot be surpassed. Its growth by CVD\nenables these properties to be optimized, controlled and exploited in many applications.\nIts strong lattice is most obviously important in wear applications, but also feeds into its stiffness\nas an acoustic material and its radiation hardness for detectors. The lattice enables the phonon\ntransport that gives diamond its exceptional thermal conductivity, and its strength helps create\nrobust optical and microwave windows.\nTransparency over such a wide wavelength range is technically fascinating, and extremely useful.\nDiamond became useful at long wavelengths when large areas and millimetre thicknesses were\nattained. Controlling absorption, photoluminescence and birefringence in single crystal diamond,\nby reducing impurities and defects, now opens up applications with visible light.\nIts carrier transport properties and wide bandgap can be exploited in electronics, with reduced\ndefect concentrations enabling operation at higher voltages, power and frequencies than can be\nachieved with other semiconductors. Controlled addition of impurities is also essential to provide\ncarriers and low resistance contacts in these applications.\nThe wide electrochemical potential window of diamond can be utilized if the highest levels of\nboron are added, bringing new electroanalysis techniques and environmentally beneficial waste\ntreatment.\nIts high thermal conductivity is a key enabler for other technologies as a heat spreader. It\nunderpins its potential performance in high power electronics and in novel visible and near infrared lasers, as well as its delivered performance in abrasive tools, multi-kW laser windows and\nmegawatt microwave windows.\nIn the last ten years advances in commercial CVD diamond growth have enabled consistent, high\nquality grades of diamond with tailored properties. Diamond is being used in applications\nranging from tweeter domes, to exit windows for lasers used in industry.\n\n26\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nMoving forward, each new user will set their priorities, but areas for continued development\ninclude electronic doping, increasing the size of single crystals and cost reduction. With access\navailable to high quality material, new users will address challenges of integration to create novel\ndevices. They will develop techniques to control strain and bonding in lasers, and enhance\nmetallization and packaging for electronics. The potential of diamond extends far beyond the\nproperties traditionally associated with mechanical applications or gemstones, and CVD diamond\nis already proving that it brings innovative solutions to a range of challenging applications.\n\n27\n\n\fChemical vapour deposition synthetic diamond: materials, technology and applications\n\nReferences\nAbe Y, Tappero F, Tanaka Y, Takagi Y and Maizza G 2006 Microgravity Science and\nTechnology 18 178-83\nAdam W, Bellini B et al. 2003 Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A 511 124\nAlehashem S, Chambers F, Strojek J W, Swain G M and R.
