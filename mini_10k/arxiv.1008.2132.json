Undoped TbMnO3 and DyMnO3 reveal multiferroic behavior 1 . Under nonisovalent substitution all the\northorhombic manganites reveal an insulator-to-metal\n(IM) transition and colossal magnetoresistance (CMR)\neffect which are currently explained in terms of an electronic phase separation (EPS) triggered by a hole doping. Overview of the current state of the art with theoretical and experimental situation in doped CMR manganites R1\u2212x Sr(Ca)x MnO3 can be found in many review\narticles2\u20136 .\nHowever, even nominally pure undoped stoichiometric parent manganite LaMnO3 does exhibit a puzzling\nbehavior inconsistent with a simple picture of an Atype antiferromagnetic insulator (A-AFI) which it is usually assigned to 2\u20136 . First it concerns anomalous transport properties 7\u20139 , photoinduced absorption 10 , pressureinduced effects 11 , dielectric anomalies 12 , and the high\nfield-induced IM transition 13 . Below, in the paper we\ndemonstrate that the unconventional behavior of parent\nmanganite LaMnO3 can be explained to be a result of\nan electronic phase separation inherent even for nominally pure stoichiometric manganite with a coexistence of\nconventional A-AFI phase and unconventional electronhole Bose liquid (EHBL) which nucleation is a result of\na charge transfer (CT) instability of A-AFI phase. In a\nsense, hereafter we report a comprehensive elaboration of\na so-called \"disproportionation\" scenario in manganites\nwhich was addressed earlier by many authors, however,\nby now it was not properly developed.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II we discuss an unconventional first order phase transition in\n\nparent manganite LaMnO3 and argue that it should be\naddressed to be a disproportionation rather than a JahnTeller phase transition. Then we show that the resonant X-ray scattering data can be used to reconstruct\na \"phase diagram\" which shows a tentative temperature dependence of the volume fraction of two competing phases for parent LaMnO3 . The electron-lattice relaxation effects and the self-trapping of the CT excitons\nwith nucleation of electron-hole droplets are considered\nin Sec.III. In Sec.IV we describe the details of the charge\nand spin structure of electron-hole dimers to be main\nbuilding blocks of novel phase in a parent manganite.\nThe effective Hamiltonian of the EHBL phase equivalent\nto a triplet boson double exchange model is addressed\nin Sec.V. Numerous optical, magnetic, and other manifestations of the EH dimers and EH droplets in parent\nand low-hole-doped manganites are considered in Sec.VI.\nShort comments on the hole doping effects are made in\nSec.VII. Short conclusions are presented in Sec.VIII.\n\nII. FIRST EXPERIMENTAL SIGNATURES OF\nDISPROPORTIONATION AND ELECTRONIC\nPHASE SEPARATION IN PARENT\nMANGANITE LaMnO3\nA.\n\nUnconventional first order phase transition in\nLaMnO3\n\nMeasurements on single crystals of the hightemperature transport and magnetic properties, 7\u20139,14\nresonant X-ray scattering 15,16 and neutron-diffraction 17\nstudies of the RMnO3 family point to a first order\nelectronic phase transition at T=TJT (TJT \u2248 750 K in\nLaMnO3 ) from the low-temperature orbitally ordered\n\n\f2\n(OO) antiferromagnetic insulating phase (O' orthorhombic Pbnm) with a cooperative Jahn-Teller ordering of\nthe occupied orbitals of the MnO6 octahedra to a hightemperature charge and orbitally disordered phase (O orthorhombic, or \"pseudocubic\" Pbnm). It is worth noting\nthat the \"first-orderness\" is rather unexpected point for\nthe cooperative Jahn-Teller ordering as a common viewpoint implies it is to be a second-order \"order-disorder\"\ntype phase transition. According to the conventional\nmodel of the first order phase transitions there are\ntwo characteristic temperatures: T\u22171 <TJT and T\u22172 >TJT\n(\"supercooling\" and \"superheating spinodals\", respectively) which determine the temperature range of the\ncoexistence of the both phases. The both temperatures\nare hardly defined for parent manganites. A change in\nslope of the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power at T\u22171 \u2248 600 K in LaMnO3 9,14 is considered\nto be due to nucleation of an orbitally disordered phase\non heating or homogeneous nucleation of the low-T OO\nphase on cooling. The volume fraction of charge and orbitally disordered phase is to monotonically grew with\nincreasing temperature in the interval T\u22171 <T<TJT , but\nincrease discontinuously on heating across TJT . The lowT OO phase looses stability only at T\u22172 >TJT . Weak\ndiffuse X-ray scattering consistent with orbital fluctuations, was observed in LaMnO3 with the intensity falling\ngradually with increasing temperature and disappearing\nabove T\u22172 \u223c 1000 K concomitant with the suppression of\nthe octahedral tilt ordering and a structural transition\nto a rhombohedral phase 16 .\nThe X-ray diffraction data 18 for LaMnO3 have revealed a coexistence of two orthorhombic Pbnm phases\nO' and O in a wide temperature range both below\nand above TJT . It means that a sizeable volume fraction of large (\u223c 1000 \u00c5) domains of low-(high-) temperature phase survives between TJT and T\u22172 (T\u22171 and\nTJT ), respectively. However, it does not prevent the\nnanoscopic size droplets to survive outside this temperature range. Furthermore, the neutron diffraction\nmeasurements (T < 300 K) for several samples of nominal composition LaMnO3 after different heat treatment seemingly provoking the nucleation of a hightemperature phase 19 have revealed a coexistence of bare\northorhombic A-AFI phase with another orthorhombic\nand rhombohedral, however, ferromagnetic phases with\na considerably (\u223c 2%) smaller unit-cell volume and ordering temperatures TC near TN . Puzzlingly, this coexistence spread out over all temperature range studied\nfrom room temperature up to 10 K. Similar effects have\nbeen observed in a complex (ac initial magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, magnetoresistance, and neutron\ndiffraction) study (T < 300 K) of slightly nonstoichiometric LaMnO3+\u03b4 system 20 . Interestingly that all over the\nferromagnetic phases the thermal factors of oxygen atoms\npresent an excess \u2206B \u223c 0.3-0.5 \u00c52 as compared with antiferromagnetic A-AFI phase that points to a specific role\nof dynamic lattice effects.\nEven in the absence of chemical doping, LaMnO3\n\nshows the ability to accommodate a so-called \"oxidative nonstoichiometry\", which also involves the partial\noxidation of some Mn3+ to Mn4+ which smaller size\nleads to an increase of the tolerance factor, thus stabilizing the perovskite structure 21 . The manganite crystals grown by the floating zone method seem to preserve\nwell-developed traces of the high-temperature phase. Interestingly, that the LaMnO3 crystals do not tolerate repeated excursions to high temperatures, 800 K, before\nchanging their properties. Such an anomalous memory\neffect with an overall loss of long-range orbital order in\none sample of the LaMnO3 after extended cycling above\n1000 K and cooling back to room temperature was observed by Zimmermann et al. 16 . It is worth mentioning that the characteristic temperatures T\u22171 , TJT , T\u22172 for\nthe phase transition are believed to depend on the initial content of Mn4+ 17 : the sample used in Ref. 22 gave\nTJT = 600 K and T\u22172 = 800 K, suggesting the presence of a\nnon-negligble amount of Mn4+ that reduces the temperatures of the phase transition. All these data evidence an\nexistence of electronic phase separation inherent for parent stoichiometric LaMnO3 with the phase volume fraction sensitive to sample stoichiometry, prehistory, and\nmorphology.\nB. The disproportionation rather than the JT\nnature of the phase transition in parent LaMnO3\n\nThe electronic state in the high-temperature O orthorhombic phase of parent LaMnO3 remains poorly\nunderstood. The transport measurements 9 (resistivity\n\u03c1(T ) and thermoelectric power \u03b1(T ), see, also Refs.7,8,\n23,24) were interpreted by the authors as a striking evidence of the R(Mn2+ Mn4+ )O3 disproportionation rather\nthan a simple orbitally disordered RMn3+ O3 character of\nthe high-temperature phase. Let us shortly overview the\nargumentation by Zhou and Goodenough 9 . Thermoelectric power reveals an irreversible change from \u03b1(300 K) =\n\u2212 600 \u03bcV /K to about 550 \u03bcV /K on thermal cycling to\n1100 K with a nearly zero value at T>TJT . Smallpolaron conduction by a single charge carrier would give\na temperature-independent thermoelectric power dominated by the statistical term:\n\u03b1 = \u2212(k/e) ln[(1 \u2212 c)/c] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c is the fraction of Mn sites occupied by a charge\ncarrier and the spin degree of freedom is lifted by the\nstrong intra-atomic exchange. Near stoichiometry, two\ntypes of charge carriers may be present, but with only\none dominating at room temperature to give a large negative or large positive \u03b1(300 K) for a small value of c.\nFrom Eq. (1) value of \u03b1(300 K) \u2248 \u00b1 600 \u03bcV /K in the\nvirgin crystal reflects a small fraction (c \u2248 0.001) of a disbalance between electron- and hole-like mobile/immobile\ncharges. An abrupt drop in \u03b1(T ) and \u03c1(T ) at TJT to a\nnearly temperature-independent and a nearly zero value\nfor T>TJT with a reversible behavior of both quantities\n\n\f3\n\nIn contrast with the high-temperature measurements\ncarried out in a vacuum of 10\u22123 torr 9 , the transport\nmeasurements performed in air 28 evidenced another evolution of \u03b1(T ) (see Fig. 1). On heating the thermoelectric power starts from large, but positive values and on\ncooling from T>TJT \u03b1(T ) does not return to its original value because the sample, according to authors 28 ,\nbecomes slightly (\u223c 1%) oxidized. A simple comparison\nof the two data sets 9,28 points to an unconventional behavior of parent manganite on crossing the \"supercooling\nspinodal\" temperature T\u22171 . The system can memorize a\nhigh-temperature phase up to temperatures below 300 K.\nThe role of a slight oxidation seemingly reduces to be an\nadditional regulative factor governing the A-AFI/EHBL\nphase volume fraction.\nStrong and irreversible temperature dependence of\n\u03b1(T ) and \u03c1(T ) at T<T\u22171 agrees with a scenario of a\nwell developed electronic phase separation with a puzzling electron-hole symmetry and a strong sensitivity of\ntransport properties both to a sample morphology and\nquality. The magnitude of the resistivity and character\nof irreversibility agrees with a poor metal like conductivity of high-temperature phase and points to a considerable volume fraction of this phase to survive up to room\ntemperature. Resistivity of different samples of the nominally same composition can differ by orders of magnitude.\nInterestingly that these data point to a possibility of a\ncolossal, up to six orders of magnitude, variations of resistivity in parent LaMnO3 at a constant temperature well\nbelow TJT only due to the variation in its A-AFI/EHBL\nvolume fraction composition which can be realized by\nthe temperature change, pressure, isotopic substitution,\napplication of external magnetic/electric field, and photoirradiation. This behavior can hardly be directly related with the colossal magnetoresistivity observed for\nthe hole doped manganites, however, this novel phase\ncan be an important participant of electronic transformations in manganites.\nBelow T=T\u22171 (T\u22171 \u2248 600 K in LaMnO3 ), or the temperature of the homogeneous nucleation of the low-T OO\nphase, the high-temperature mixed-valence EH phase\nloses stability, however, survives due to various charge inhomogeneities forming EH droplets pinned by statically\nfluctuating electric fields.\n\n5\n\n10\n\n600\n\nLaMnO3\n\nSeebeck (mV/K)\n\n400\n\n10\n\n200\nSeebeck\n\n10\n\n0\n10\n\n-200\n\n10\n\n10\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-600\n300\n\n3\n\n1\n\nResistivity\n\n-400\n\n1.0\n\n4\n\n10\n\nResistivity (Wcm)\n\nagrees with a phase transition to a fully disproportionated Mn2+ +Mn4+ , or, more precisely, to an electronhole liquid phase 25\u201327 with a two-particle transport and\ncef f = 0.5. However, the system retains a rather high\nvalue of resistivity, that is the EH liquid phase manifests\na \"poor\" metal behavior. Strictly speaking, the disproportionation phase transition at T=Tdisp =TJT is governed firstly by a charge order rather than the orbital\norder parameter. In other words, the Jahn-Teller ordering at T=TJT only accompanies the charge ordering\nat T=Tdisp =TJT , hence a simplified Jahn-Teller picture\ndoes misinterpret a true sense of the phenomenon.\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n900 1000\nT (K)\n\nfEH\nO' orthorhombic\nJT ordering\nA-type AFM\n\ndynamic\nEH droplets\nO orthorhombic\nFM-EHBL\n\nstatic\n0\n\n200\n\nTNTC\n\n400\n\nTg?\n\n600*\n\nT1\n\n800\n\nTdisp=TJT\n\n1000*\n\nT2 T (K)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Top panel: Temperature dependence\nof thermoelectric power and resistivity in parent manganite LaMnO3 (reproduced from Refs. 9,28).

Note a\ndifference in TJ T values in Refs. 15,16 and Ref. 9\n\nC.\n\nTemperature dependence of the EHBL volume\nfraction\n\nBy now we have no information about how the both\nphases share the volume fraction on cooling from high\ntemperatures. Clearly, such an information depends\nstrongly on the techniques used. For instance, the both\nlong-lived static domains and short-lived dynamic fluctuations of either phase contribute to optical response,\nwhile only the large static domains are seen in conventional x-ray or neutron scattering measurements. Fortunately, the resonant X-ray scattering data 15,16 can be\n\n\f4\nused to reconstruct the tentative T-fEH \"phase diagram\"\nof a manganite with fEH being a volume fraction of EH\ndroplets. Indeed, the intensity of this scattering depends\non the size of the splitting \u2206 of the Mn 4p levels, induced by the orbital ordering of Mn 3deg states, hence\nis nonzero only for orbitally ordered Mn3+ ions in distorted MnO6 octahedra. The first-order nature of the cooperative JT phase transition in LaMnO3 9 implies that\nthe local orbital order parameter such as \u2206 in Ref.15\nremains nearly constant below the transition temperature 29 , hence the temperature behavior of resonant X-ray\nscattering intensity has to reflect the temperature change\nof the net (static+dynamic) OO phase volume fraction\nrather than \u2206(T ) effect. This suggestion agrees with\nthe neutron-diffraction studies by Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Carvajal et\nal. 17 evidencing no visible effect of the antiferromagnetic\nspin ordering at T=TN \u2248 140 K on the OO parameter,\nwhile the X-ray scattering intensity dramatically (up to\n40%) falls upon heating above TN 15 . Overall, the temperature dependence of the resonant X-ray scattering intensity in LaMnO3 shows up an unusual behaviour with\nan arrest or even clear hole between 300-500 K, a sharp\ndownfall above T=T\u22171 \u2248 600 K and vanishing right after\nT=TJT \u2248 750 K. Thus, the X-ray data 15,16 can be used\nto find the temperature behavior of the resultant static\nand dynamic EH droplet volume fraction in the sample.\nIn Fig. 1 we have reproduced experimental data from\nRefs. 15,16 renormalized and transformed into a relative\nvolume fraction of a \"non-OO\" phase supposed to be\nan EH droplet phase. The renormalization implied the\nlow-temperature 75% volume fraction of the OO phase.\nDifferent filling (from top to bottom) points to an A-AFI\nphase, orbital fluctuation phase near TJT , dynamic and\nstatic EH droplet phase, respectively. Despite the overall fall of the EH droplet volume fraction on cooling from\nTJT , we expect some intervals of the reentrant behavior\ndue to a subtle competition of two phases. It is clear\nthat any ordering does lower the free energy of the phase\nthus resulting in a rise of its volume fraction. Taking into\naccount experimental data from Ref. 19 pointing to close\ntemperatures of AFI and FI ordering in competing phases\n(TN and TC , respectively), we may assign a signature of\na reentrant behavior at 400-600 K to a glass-like transition within the EH liquid near T=Tg \u223c 400 K. Surely, we\nare aware that the picture shown in Fig. 1 is not a real\nphase diagram, however, it is very instructive for a qualitative understanding of a complex phase competition in\nparent manganite.\nConcluding the section, we should once more emphasize a dramatic charge instability of parent manganite\nLaMnO3 with extreme sensitivity to different external\nfactors, sample stoichiometry and prehistory. In this\nconnection, it is worth noting that highly stoichiometric LaMnO3 samples measured by Sub\u0131\u0301as et al.30 did not\nshow noticeable temperature dependence of the resonant\nintensity for the (3,0,0) reflection from 10 to 300 K, in\ncontrast with the data by Murakami et al.15 . Further\nwork at an even higher temperature range and for differ-\n\nent samples seems to be necessary in order to distinctly\nreveal and examine the phase separated state in a parent\nmanganite.\nIII. ELECTRON-LATTICE RELAXATION AND\nNUCLEATION OF EH DROPLETS IN A PARENT\nMANGANITE\nA.\n\nElectron-lattice relaxation and self-trapping of\nCT excitons\n\nAt first glance the disproportionation in manganese\ncompounds is hardly possible since manganese atom does\nnot manifest a valence-skipping phenomenon as, e.g. bismuth atom which can be found as Bi3+ or Bi5+ , but\nnot Bi4+ , with a generic bismuth oxide BaBiO3 to be a\nwell-known example of a charge disproportionated system. Strictly speaking, sometimes manganese reveals a\nvalence preference, e.g., while the both Mn2+ and Mn4+\nare observed in MgO:Mn and CaO:Mn, the Mn3+ center is missing 31 . Furthermore, the d4 configuration of\nMn3+ ion is argued32 to be a missing oxidation state due\nto the large exchange-correlation energy gain that stabilizes the d5 electronic configuration thus resulting in the\ncharge disproportionation or dynamical charge fluctuation 2 d4 \u2192d3 + d5 .\nThe reason for valence skipping or valence preference\nobserved for many elements still remains a mistery. Recently, Harrison 33 has argued that most likely traditional lattice relaxation effects, rather than any intraatomic mechanisms (specific behavior of ionization energies, stability of closed shells, strong screening of the\nhigh-charged states) are a driving force for disproportionation with formation of so-called \"negative-U\" centers.\nAnyhow the disproportionation in an insulator signals\na well developed CT instability. What is a microscopic\norigin of the CT instability in parent manganites? The\ndisproportionation reaction can be considered to be a\nfinal stage of a self-trapping of the d \u2212 d CT excitons\n(Mott-Hubbard excitons) that determine the main lowenergy CT band peaked near 2 eV in LaMnO3 34 . Indeed,\nthese two-center excitations due to a charge transfer between two MnO6 octahedra may be considered as quanta\nof the disproportionation reaction\n9\u2212\n8\u2212\n10\u2212\nMnO9\u2212\n,\n6 + MnO6 \u2192 MnO6 + MnO6\n\n(2)\n\nwith the creation of electron MnO10\u2212\nand hole MnO8\u2212\n6\n4\n26\ncenters. Within a simplest model the former corresponds to a nominal 3d5 (Mn2+ ) configuration, while the\nlatter does to the 3d3 (Mn4+ ) one.\nThe minimal energy cost of the optically excited disproportionation or electron-hole formation in insulating\nmanganites is 2.0 \u2212 2.5 eV 34 . However, the question\narises, what is the energy cost for the thermal excitation\nof such a local disproportionation or effective correlation\nenergy U ? The answer implies first of all the knowledge\nof relaxation energy, or the energy gain due to the lattice\n\n\f5\npolarization by the localized charges. The full polarization energy R includes the cumulative effect of electronic\nand ionic terms, related with the displacement of electron\nshells and ionic cores, respectively 35 . The former term\nRopt is due to the non-retarded effect of the electronic polarization by the momentarily localized electron-hole pair\ngiven the ionic cores fixed at their perfect crystal positions. Such a situation is typical for lattice response accompanying the Franck-Condon transitions (optical excitation, photoionization). On the other hand, all the\nlong-lived excitations, i.e., all the intrinsic thermally activated states and the extrinsic particles produced as a\nresult of doping, injection or optical pumping should be\nregarded as stationary states of a system with a deformed\nlattice structure.\n\nCT exciton\nU<0\nU>0\n\nU>0\n3+\n\nMn -Mn\na)\n\n3+\n\n3+\n\nMn -Mn\nQ\n\nb)\n\n3+\n\nself-trapped\nCT exciton\n2+\n4+\nMn -Mn\nQ\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Simple illustration of the electronlattice polarization effects for CT excitons (see text for details.)\n\nThe lattice relaxation energies, \u2212\u2206Rth , associated\nwith the hole/electron localisation in 3d oxides are particularly large. For instance, in LaMnO3 the optical (nonrelaxed) energies of the creation of the hole on Mn and O\nMn\nsites are 2.6 and 4.9 eV, respectively, while \u2212\u2206Rth\n=0.7O\n36\n0.8 and \u2212\u2206Rth = 2.4 eV . In other words, the electronic hole is marginally more stable at the Mn-site than\nat the O-site in the LaMnO3 lattice, however, both possibilities should be treated seriously.\nShell-model estimations 36 yield for the energy of the\noptically excited disproportionation (2) or electron-hole\nformation in parent manganite LaMnO3 :Eopt \u2248 3.7 eV,\nwhile the respective thermal relaxation energy is estimated as \u2212\u2206Rth \u2248 1.0 eV. Despite the estimations imply the noninteracting electron and hole centers these are\nbelieved to provide a sound background for any reasonable models of self-trapped d \u2212 d CT excitons. Thorough calculation of the localisation energy for electronhole dimers remains a challenging task for future studies.\nIt is worth noting that despite their very large, several\neV magnitudes, the relaxation effects are not incorporated into current theoretical models of manganites.\nFig. 2 illustrates two possible ways the electron-lattice\npolarization governs the CT exciton evolution. Shown\nare the adiabatic potentials (AP) for the two-center\nground state M 0 \u2212 M 0 configuration and excited M \u00b1 \u2212\nM \u2213 CT, or disproportionated configuration. The Q co-\n\nordinate is related with a lattice degree of freedom. For\nlower branch of AP in the system we have either a single minimum point for the GS configuration (Fig. 2a) or\na two-well structure with an additional local minimum\npoint (Fig. 2b) associated with the self-trapped CT exciton. This \"bistability\" effect is of primary importance for\nour analysis. Indeed, these two minima are related with\ntwo (meta)stable charge states with and without CT, respectively, which form two candidates to struggle for a\nground state. It is worth noting that the self-trapped\nCT exciton may be descibed as a configuration with negative disproportionation energy U . Thus one concludes\nthat all the systems such as manganites may be divided\ninto two classes: CT stable systems with the only lower\nAP branch minimum for a certain charge configuration,\nand bistable, or CT unstable systems with two lower AP\nbranch minima for two local charge configurations one of\nwhich is associated with the self-trapped CT excitons resulting from self-consistent charge transfer and electronlattice relaxation. Such excitons are often related with\nthe appearance of the \"negative-U \" effect. It means that\nthe three types of MnO6 centers MnO8,9,10\u2212\nshould be\n4\nconsidered in manganites on equal footing 26,27 .\nAbove we have presented a generalized disproportionation scenario for parent manganites in which an unconventional phase state with a 2Mn3+ \u2192Mn2+ +Mn4+ disproportionation nominally within manganese subsystem\nevolves from EH-dimers, or self-trapped d \u2212 d CT excitons. However, such a scenario in parent manganites\nwould compete with another, \"asymmetric\" disproportionation scenario\nMn3+ + O2\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+ + O1\u2212\n\n(3)\n\nthat evolves from a self-trapping of low-energy p \u2212 d\nCT excitons. Indeed, we should make a remarkable observation, which to the best of our knowledge has not\nbeen previously reported for these materials, is that the\nfamous \"manganite\" 2 eV absorption band has a composite structure being a superposition of a rather broad\nand intensive CT d \u2212 d band and several narrow and\nrelatively weak CT p \u2212 d bands 34,37 . A dual nature\nof the dielectric gap in nominally stoichiometric parent\nperovskite manganites RMnO3 , being formed by a superposition of forbidden or weak dipole allowed p-d CT\ntransitions and inter-site d-d CT transitions means that\nthese should rather be sorted neither into the CT insulator nor the Mott-Hubbard insulator in the Zaanen,\nSawatzky, Allen 38 scheme. A detailed analysis of the CT\np \u2212 d transitions in LaMnO3 has been performed by the\npresent author in Ref.37. Among the first p\u2212d candidates\nfor a self-trapping we should point to the low-energy CT\nstate ((t32g 4 A2g ; e2g 3 A2g ; 6 A1g ); t1g )5,7 T1g in MnO9\u2212\noc6\ntahedron which arises as a result of the O2p electron\ntransfer from the highest in energy nonbonding t1g orbital to the eg manganese orbital. Simplest view of this\nexciton implies the oxygen t1g hole rotating around nominally Mn2+ ion with ferro- (7 T1g ) or antiferro- (5 T1g )\nordering. It has a number of unconventional proper-\n\n\f6\nties. First, orbitally degenerated ground T1g state implies a nonquenched orbital moment and strong magnetic anisotropy. May be more important to say that\nwe deal with a Jahn-Teller center unstable with regard\nto local distortions. Second, we expect a high-spin S=3\nground state 7 T1g because of usually ferromagnetic p \u2212 d\nexchange coupling. Oxygen holes can form so-called O\u2212\nbound small polarons 39 .\nShell-model estimations 36 yield for the energy of optically excited asymmetric disproportionation (3) in parent manganite LaMnO3 :Eopt \u2248 4.75 eV, while the respective thermal relaxation energy is estimated as \u2212\u2206Rth \u2248\n1.25 eV. However, these qualitative estimations do not\nconcern a number of important points such as p-d and pp covalency, and a partial delocalisation of oxygen holes.\nA sharp electron-hole asymmetry and a rather big\nS=3 ground state spin value most likely exclude the\nself-trapped p \u2212 d CT excitons as candidates to form a\nhigh-temperature T > TJT phase of parent manganite.\nHowever, the \"dangerous\" closeness to the ground state\nmakes them to be the potential participants of any perturbations taking place for parent manganites.\n\nB.\n\nNucleation of EH droplets in a parent\nmanganite\n\nThe AP bistability in CT unstable insulators points to\ntempting perspectives of their evolution under either external impact. Metastable CT excitons in the CT unstable M 0 phase, or EH-dimers, present candidate \"relaxed\nexcited states\" to struggle for stability with ground state\nand the natural nucleation centers for electron-hole liquid phase. What way the CT unstable M 0 phase can be\ntransformed into novel phase? It seems likely that such\na phase transition could be realized due to a mechanism\nfamiliar to semiconductors with filled bands such as Ge\nand Si where given certain conditions one observes a formation of metallic EH-liquid as a result of the exciton\ndecay 40 . However, the system of strongly correlated electron M \u2212 and hole M + centers appears to be equivalent to\nan electron-hole Bose-liquid in contrast with the electronhole Fermi-liquid in conventional semiconductors. The\nMott-Wannier excitons in the latter wide-band systems\ndissociate easily producing two-component electron-hole\ngas or plasma 40 , while small CT excitons both free and\nself-trapped are likely to be stable with regard to the\nEH dissociation. At the same time, the two-center CT\nexcitons have a very large fluctuating electrical dipole\nmoment |d| \u223c 2eRMM and can be involved into attractive electrostatic dipole-dipole interaction. Namely this\nis believed to be important incentive to the proliferation of excitons and its clusterization. The CT excitons are proved to attract each other and form molecules\ncalled biexcitons, and more complex clusters, or excitonic\nstrings, where the individuality of the separate exciton is\nlikely to be lost. Moreover, one may assume that like\nthe semiconductors with indirect band gap structure, it\n\nis energetically favorable for the system to separate into\na low density exciton phase coexisting with the microregions of a high density two-component phase composed\nof electron M \u2212 and hole M + centers, or EH droplets. Indeed, the excitons may be considered to be well defined\nentities only at small content, whereas at large densities\ntheir coupling is screened and their overlap becomes so\nconsiderable that they loose individuality and we come to\nthe system of electron M \u2212 and hole M + centers, which\nform a metallic-like electron-hole Bose liquid with a main\ntwo-particle transport mechanism 27 . An increase of injected excitons in this case merely increases the size of the\nEH droplets, without changing the free exciton density.\nAn EH droplet seems to have no distinct boundary,\nmost likely it looks like a core with more or less stable electron and hole centers surrounded by a cloud of\nmetastable CT excitons. Homogeneous nucleation implies the spontaneous formation of EH droplets due to\nthe thermodynamic fluctuations in exciton gas. Generally speaking, such a state with a nonzero volume fraction\nof EH droplets and the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry can be stable in nominally pure insulating crystal. However, the level of intrinsic nonstoichiometry in 3d oxides is significant (one charged defect every\n100-1000 molecular units is common). The charged defect produces random electric field, which can be very\nlarge (up to 108 Vcm\u22121 ) thus promoting the condensation of CT excitons and the inhomogeneous nucleation of\nEH droplets.\nDeviation from the neutrality implies the existence of\nadditional electron, or hole centers that can be the natural centers for the inhomogeneous nucleation of the EH\ndroplets. Such droplets are believed to provide a more\neffective screening of the electrostatic repulsion for additional electron/hole centers, than the parent insulating phase. As a result, the electron/hole injection to\nthe insulating M 0 phase due to a nonisovalent substitution as in La1\u2212x Srx MnO3 or change in stoihiometry as in\nLax MnO3 , LaMnO3\u2212\u03b4 or field-effect is believed to shift\nthe phase equilibrium from the insulating state to the unconventional electron-hole Bose liquid, or in other words\ninduce the insulator-to-EHBL phase transition. This process results in a relative increase of the energy of the\nparent phase and creates proper conditions for its competing with others phases capable to provide an effective\nscreening of the charge inhomogeneity potential. The\nstrongly degenerate system of electron and hole centers\nin EH droplet is one of the most preferable ones for this\npurpose. At the beginning (nucleation regime) an EH\ndroplet nucleates as a nanoscopic cluster composed of\nseveral number of neighboring electron and hole centers\npinned by disorder potential. It is clear that such a situation does not exclude the self-doping with the formation\nof a self-organized collective charge-inhomogeneous state\nin systems which are near the charge instability.\nEH droplets can manifest itself remarkably in various\nproperties of the 3d oxides even at small volume fraction, or in a \"pseudo-impurity regime\". Insulators in this\n\n\f7\nregime should be considered as phase inhomogeneous systems with, in general, thermo-activated mobility of the\ninter-phase boundaries. On the one hand, main features\nof this \"pseudo-impurity regime\" would be determined\nby the partial intrinsic contributions of the appropriate\nphase components with possible limitations imposed by\nthe finite size effects. On the other hand, the real properties will be determined by the peculiar geometrical factors such as a volume fraction, average size of droplets\nand its dispersion, the shape and possible texture of the\ndroplets, the geometrical relaxation rates. These factors\nare tightly coupled, especially near phase transitions for\neither phase (long range antiferromagnetic ordering for\nthe parent phase, the charge ordering and other phase\ntransformations for the EH droplets) accompanied by the\nvariation in a relative volume fraction.\nNumerous examples of the unconventional behavior\nof the 3d oxides in the pseudo-impurity regime could\nbe easily explained with taking into account the interphase boundary effects (coercitivity, the mobility threshold, non-ohmic conductivity, oscillations, relaxation etc.)\nand corresponding characteristic quantities. Under increasing doping the pseudo-impurity regime with a relatively small volume fraction of EH droplets (nanoscopic\nphase separation) can gradually transform into a macro(chemical) \"phase-separation regime\" with a sizeable volume fraction of EH droplets, and finally to a new EH\nliquid phase.\nIV.\n\nA.\n\nELECTRON-HOLE DIMERS IN PARENT\nMANGANITE\nEH-dimers: physical versus chemical view\n\nParent manganites are believed to be unconventional\nsystems which are unstable with regard to a self-trapping\nof the low-energy charge transfer excitons which are precursors of nucleation of the EH Bose liquid. Hereafter\nwe should emphasize once more that a view of the selftrapped CT exciton to be a Mn2+ -Mn4+ pair is typical\nfor a chemical view of disproportionation, and is strongly\noversimplified. Actually we deal with an EH-dimer to be\na dynamically charge fluctuating system of coupled elecand hole MnO8\u2212\ntron MnO10\u2212\n4 centers having been glued\n6\nin a lattice due to a strong electron-lattice polarization\neffects. In other words, we should proceed with a rather\ncomplex physical view of disproportionation phenomena\nwhich first implies a charge exchange reaction\nMn2+ + Mn4+ \u2194 Mn4+ + Mn2+ ,\n\n(4)\n\ngoverned by a two-particle charge transfer integral\ntB = hMn2+ Mn4+ |\u0124B |Mn4+ Mn2+ i ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u0124B is an effective two-particle (bosonic) transfer\nHamiltonian, and we assume a parallel orientation of all\nthe spins. As a result of this quantum process the bare\n\nionic states with site-centred charge order and the same\nbare energy E0 transform into two EH-dimer states with\nan indefinite valence and bond-centred charge-order\n1\n|\u00b1i = \u221a (|Mn2+ Mn4+ i \u00b1 |Mn4+ Mn2+ i)\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwith the energies E\u00b1 = E0 \u00b1 tB . In other words, the\nexchange reaction restores the bare charge symmetry. In\nboth |\u00b1i states the site manganese valence is indefinite\nwith quantum fluctuations between +2 and +4, however,\nwith a mean value +3. Interestingly that, in contrast\nwith the ionic states, the EH-dimer states |\u00b1i have both a\ndistinct electron-hole and inversion symmetry, even parity (s-type symmetry) for |+i, and odd parity (p-type\nsymmetry) for |\u2212i states, respectively. The both states\nare coupled by a large electric-dipole matrix element:\nh+|d\u0302|\u2212i = 2eRMnMn ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere RMnMn is a Mn-Mn separation.\nThe twoparticle transport Mn2+ -Mn4+ \u2192Mn4+ -Mn2+ can be realized through two successive one-particle processes with\nthe eg -electron transfer as follows\neg\n\neg\n\nMn2+ + Mn4+ \u2192 Mn3+ + Mn3+ \u2192 Mn4+ + Mn2+ ,\nhence the two-particle transfer integral tB can be evaluated as follows:\ntB = \u2212t2eg /U ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere teg is one-particle transfer integral for eg electron,\nU is a mean transfer energy. It means that the twoparticle bosonic transfer integral can be directly coupled\neg\nto Heisenberg exwith the kinetic eg -contribution Jkin\neg\nchange integral. Both tB and Jkin are determined by the\nsecond order one-particle transfer mechanism. It should\nbe noted that negative sign of the two-particle CT integral tB points to the energy stabilization of the s-type\nEH-dimer state |+i.\nSecond, one should emphasize once more that the stabilization of EH-dimers is provided by a strong electronlattice effect with a striking intermediate oxygen atom\npolarization and displacement concommitant with charge\nexchange. In a sense, the EH-dimer may be addressed to\nbe a bosonic counterpart of the Zener Mn4+ -Mn3+ polaron 41 . It is no wonder that even in a generic disproportionated system BaBiO3 instead of simple checkerboard\ncharge ordering of Bi3+ and Bi5+ ions we arrive at CDW\nstate with the alteration of expanded Bi(4\u2212\u03c1)+ O6 and\ncompressed Bi(4+\u03c1)+ O6 octahedra with 0 < \u03c1 \u226a 1 42 .\nEnormously large values of oxygen thermal parameters\nin BaBiO3 43 evidence a great importance of dynamical\noxygen breathing modes providing some sort of a \"disproportionation glue\". Sharp rise of the oxygen thermal parameter in the high-temperature O phase of LaMnO3 17\nor in several \"competing\" phases found by Huang et al. 19\nas compared with the bare AFI phase is believed to be a\nclear signature of the manganese disproportionation.\n\n\f8\nThe formation of EH-dimers seems to be a more complex process than it is assumed in simplified approaches\nsuch as Peierls-Hubbard model (see, e.g., Ref.44) or RiceSneddon model 45 . As a rule, these focus on the breathing\nmode for the intermediate oxygen ion and neglect strong\neffects of the overall electron-lattice relaxation. The EHdimer can be viewed as an Jahn-Teller center (JT polaron) with the energy spectrum perturbed by strong\nelectron-lattice effects.\nThus we see that a simple chemical view of the disproportionation should be actually replaced by a more realistic physical view that implies a quantum and dynamical\nnature of the disproportionation reaction.\nB.\n\nEH-dimers: spin structure\n\nLet's apply to spin degrees of freedom which are of\ngreat importance for magnetic properties both of isolated\nEH-dimer and of the EHBL phase that evolves from the\nEH-dimers. The net spin of the EH-dimer is S = S1 +S2 ,\nwhere S1 (S1 = 5/2) and S2 (S1 = 3/2) are spins of\nMn2+ and Mn4+ ions, respectively. In nonrelativistic\napproximation the spin structure of the EH-dimer will be\ndetermined by isotropic Heisenberg exchange coupling\nVex = J (S1 * S2 ),\n\n(9)\n\nwith J being an exchange integral, and two-particle\ncharge transfer characterized by a respective transfer integral which depend on spin states as follows:\nh\n\n53\n35\n1\n; SM |\u0124B | ; SM i =\nS(S + 1) tB ,\n22\n22\n20\n\n(10)\n\nwhere tB is a spinless transfer integral. Making use of\nthis relation we can introduce an effective spin-operator\nform for the boson transfer as follows:\ni\ntB h\nef f\n2(\u015c1 * \u015c2 ) + S1 (S1 + 1) + S2 (S2 + 1) ,\n\u0124B\n=\n20\n(11)\nwhich can be a very instructive tool both for qualitative and quantitative analysis of boson transfer effects,\nin particular, the temperature effects. For instance, the\nexpression points to a strong, almost twofold, suppression of effective transfer integral in paramagnetic phase\nas compared with its maximal value for a ferromagnetic\nordering.\nBoth conventional Heisenberg exchange coupling and\nunconventional two-particle bosonic transfer, or bosonic\ndouble exchange can be easily diagonalized in the net\nspin S representation so that for the energy we arrive at\nES =\n\nJ\n25\n1\n[S(S + 1) \u2212 ] \u00b1 S(S + 1) tB ,\n2\n2\n20\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u00b1 corresponds to two quantum superpositions |\u00b1i\nwritten in a spin representation as follows\n35\n1 53\n|SM i\u00b1 = \u221a (| ; SM i \u00b1 | ; SM i) ,\n2\n2\n22\n2\n\n(13)\n\nwith s- and p-type symmetry, respectively. It is worth\nnoting that the bosonic double exchange contribution\nformally corresponds to ferromagnetic exchange coupling\n1\n|tB |.\nwith JB = \u2212 10\nWe see that the cumulative effect of the Heisenberg\nexchange and the bosonic double exchange results in a\nstabilization of the S = 4 high-spin (ferromagnetic) state\nof the EH-dimer provided |tB | > 10J and the S = 1 lowspin (ferrimagnetic) state otherwise. Spin states with\nintermediate S values: S= 2, 3 correspond to a classical\nnoncollinear ordering.\nTo estimate the both quantities tB and J we can address the results of a comprehensive analysis of different exchange parameters in perovskites RFeO3 , RCrO3 ,\nand RFe1\u2212x Crx O3 with Fe3+ and Cr3+ ions 46 isoelectronic with Mn2+ and Mn4+ , respectively. For the superexchange geometry typical for LaMnO3 21 with the\nMn-O-Mn bond angle \u03b8 \u2248 155\u25e6 the authors have found\nJ=J(d5 -d3 )= +7.2 K while for J(eg eg ) \u2248 \u2212tB = 295.6 K.\nIn other words, for a net effective echange integral we\ncome to a rather large value: Jef f = J \u22120.1|tB | \u2248 22.4 K.\nDespite the antiferromagnetic sign of the Heisenberg superexchange integral these data unambiguously point to\na dominant ferromagnetic contribution of the bosonic\ndouble exchange mechanism.\nIt is worth noting that the authors 46 have predicted\nthe sign change of the superexchange integral in the d5 O2\u2212 -d3 system Fe3+ -O2\u2212 -Cr3+ in perovskite lattice from\nthe antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic one on crossing\nthe superexchange bonding angle \u03b8 \u2248 162\u25e6 . Interestingly\nthat the parameter J(eg eg ) \u2248 \u2212tB is shown to rapidly\nfall with the decrease in the bond angle \u03b8 in contrast\nwith J = J(d5 -d3 ) which reveals a rapid rise with \u03b8. For\nthe bond angle \u03b8 = 143\u25e6 typical for the heavy rare-earth\nmanganites RMnO3 (R=Dy, Ho, Y, Er) 21 the relation\nbetween tB \u2248 \u2212153.8 K and J = J(d5 -d3 ) \u2248 14.4 K 46\napproaches to the critical one: |tB | = 10 J evidencing\na destabilization of the ferromagnetic state for the EHdimers. In other words, the structural factor plays a\nsignificant role for stabilization of one or another spin\nstate of the EH-dimers. Spin structure of the EH-dimer\ngiven antiferromagnetic sign of exchange integral J>0\nand |tB | = 20 J is shown in Fig. 3. We see a dramatic\ncompetition of two opposite trends, governed by one- and\ntwo-particle transport, respectively.\nEH-dimers can manifest typical superparamagnetic behavior with large values of the effective spin magnetic\nmoment up to \u03bcef f \u2248 9\u03bcB . Both bare Mn2+ and Mn4+\nconstituents of the EH-dimer are S-type ions, i.e. these\nhave an orbitally nondegenerated ground state that predetermines a rather small spin anisotropy.\nLocal magnetic fields on the manganese nuclei in the\nboth bond-centred |SM i\u00b1 states of the EH-dimer are the\nsame and determined as follows:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 S(S + 1) + 5\nS(S + 1) \u2212 5\nHn =\nA2 +\nA4 hSi ,\n2\n2S(S + 1)\n2S(S + 1)\n(14)\nwhere A2 , A4 are hyperfine constants for Mn2+ and\n\n\f9\n\nOdd-parity\np-type states\nExchange coupling (one-particle transfer)\n\nP\n2+\n\nS=4\n\nMn -Mn\n\nP\n\nS=4\n\n4+\n\n4+\n\nS=3\n\nS=3\n\nMn -Mn\n\n2+\n\nS=2\nS=1\n\nS=2\nS=1\nS=1\nS=2\n\nEven-parity\ns-type states\n\nS=3\nS=4\n\nIndeed, the two-particle bosonic transport and respective\nkinetic contribution to stabilization of the ferromagnetic\nordering can be suppressed by a relatively small electric\nfields that makes the EH-dimer to be a promising magnetoelectric cell especially for the heavy rare-earth manganites RMnO3 (R=Dy, Ho, Y, Er) with supposedly a\nferro-antiferro instability.

It is interesting to\nnote that the 90\u25e6 - and 180\u25e6 -rotation of the hole(electron)\naround the electron(hole) corresponds to the 2nd nearest\nneighbor nnn- and 3rd nearest neighbor nnnn-hopping of\n10\u2212\nthe hole(electron) MnO8\u2212\n) center in the lattice\n6 (MnO6\nformed by the MnO9\u2212\ncenters.\nWe can introduce a set\n6\nof transfer parameters to describe the dimer dynamics:\nts = \u2212tp \u2248\n\n1 e\n(t\n+ thnnnn ) ;\n2 nnnn\n\nNMR frequencies (MHz)\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) 55 Mn NMR frequencies for bare\nMn4+,3+,2+ ions in LaMnO3 47\u201349 and theoretical predictions\nfor the EH-dimer in different spin states.

Starting with typical for Mn2+ and Mn4+ values of 52 A2 = 600\nMHz and 23 A4 = 300 MHz, respectively, we arrive at\nmaximal values of 55 Mn NMR frequencies for S= 4, 3,\n2, 1 spin states of the EH-dimer to be 450, 342.5, 237,\nand 135 MHz, respectively. The 55 Mn NMR frequencies\nfor bare Mn4+,3+,2+ ions in LaMnO3 47\u201349 and theoretical predictions for the EH-dimer in different spin states\nare shown in Fig. 4.

Experimental 55 Mn NMR\nsignal for slightly nonstoichiometric LaMnO3 50 is shown\nin Fig. 4 by filling (see Sec.VI for discussion).\nConcluding the subsection we should point to unconventional magnetoelectric properties of the EH-dimer.\n\ntsp = \u2212tps \u2248\n\n1 e\n(t\n\u2212 thnnnn ) ,\n2 nnnn\n\nfor the collinear exciton motion, and\nxy\ntxy\ns = \u2212tp \u2248\n\nxy\ntxy\nsp = tps \u2248\n\n1 e\n(t\n+ thnnn ) ;\n2 nnn\n1 e\n(t\n\u2212 thnnn )\n2 nnn\n\ncorresponding to a 90\u25e6 rotation (x \u2192 y motion) of the\nexciton. All these parameters have a rather clear physical\nsense. The electron (hole) transfer integrals for collinear\nexciton transfer te,h\nnnnn are believed to be smaller than\nte,h\nintegrals\nfor\nrectangular transfer. In other words,\nnnn\nthe two-center dimers prefer to move \"crab-like\", rather\nthan in the usual collinear mode. This implies a large\ndifference for the dimer dispersion in [100] and [110] directions.\nThe motion of the EH-dimer in the bare LaMnO3 lattice with the orbital order of the Jahn-Teller Mn3+ ions\nbears an activation character with an activation energy\n\u2206E = 21 \u2206JT , where \u2206JT is the Jahn-Teller splitting of\nthe eg levels in Mn3+ ions.

An optical\nportrait of the EH-dimer bands is composed of a rather\nnarrow low-energy line due to electro-dipole CT s \u2212 p\ntransition for immobile dimers peaked at ESP = 2|tB |\nand a relatively broad high-energy line due to electrodipole photo-induced dimer transport peaked at E \u2248\n1\n2 \u2206JT +|tB |. To estimate these energies one might use our\naforementioned estimates for |tB | \u2248 0.03 eV and reasonable estimates of the Jahn-Teller splitting \u2206JT \u2248 0.7 eV\n(see, e.g. Ref. 34). Thus we predict a two-peak structure\nof the EH-dimer optical response with a narrow line at\n\u223c 0.06 eV and a broad line at \u223c 0.4 eV. Our estimate of\nthe sp-separation ESP = 2|tB | does not account for the\nJahn-Teller polaronic effects in the EH-dimer that can\nresult in its strong increase.\nIt is worth noting that the activation character for the\nmotion of the EH-dimer in parent manganite lattice implies the same feature for the generic 2 eV d \u2212 d CT\nexciton resulting in its weak dispersion. Indeed, the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments on\nparent manganite LaMnO3 by Inami et al. 51 found the\nenergy dispersion of the 2.0-2.5 eV peak to be less than\na few hundred meV.\n\nD.\n\neffect of electrostatic attraction and local lattice relaxation (reorganization) energy.\nThe EH recombination in the EH-dimer resembles an\ninverse disproportionation reaction\n\nThe inverse counterpart of 2 eV d-d CT transition in the\nbare parent manganite is expected to have nearly the\nsame energy. The CT transition (15) in EH-dimer can\nbe induced only in E k RMnMn polarization. However,\nthis CT transition can be hardly photoinduced from the\nground s-type state of the EH-dimer in contrast with\nthe p-type state due to selection rules for electro-dipole\ntransitions. It means that at least at rather low temperatures kT \u226a 2|tB | the EH recombination band would be\ninvisible that is the optical response of EH-dimers would\nbe reduced to two aforementioned low-energy bands that\nare developed within the energy gap of the bare parent\nmanganite. In addition, we should point to different p\u2212d\nCT transitions within electron MnO10\u2212\nand hole MnO8\u2212\n6\n6\ncenters with the onset energy near 3 eV.\nIt is worth noting that the overall optical response of\nthe EH-dimers in weakly distorted perovskite lattice is\nexpected to be nearly isotropic at variance with the CT\nresponse of parent LaMnO3 in its bare A-AFI phase 34 .\nV. ELECTRON-HOLE BOSE LIQUID: THE\nTRIPLET BOSON DOUBLE EXCHANGE MODEL\nA.\n\nEffective Hamiltonian\n\nTo describe the electron-hole Bose liquid or EHBL\nphase that evolves from EH-dimers we restrict ourselves with orbital singlets 6 A1g and 4 A2g for the\nelectron MnO10\u2212\nand hole MnO8\u2212\ncenters, respec6\n6\ntively. Specific electron configurations of these centers,\nt32g ; 4 A2g e2g ; 3 A2g : 6 A1g and t32g ; 4 A2g , respectively enable us to consider the electron center MnO10\u2212\nto be\n6\ncomposed of the hole MnO8\u2212\ncenter\nand\na\ntwo-electron\n6\ne2g ; 3 A2g configuration which can be viewed as a composite triplet boson. In the absence of the external magnetic\nfield the effective Hamiltonian of the electron-hole Bose\nliquid takes the form of the Hamiltonian of the quantum\nlattice Bose gas of the triplet bosons with an exchange\ncoupling:\nX\n\u2020\n\u0124 = \u0124QLBG + \u0124ex =\ntB (ij)B\u0302im\nB\u0302jm\ni6=j,m\n\n+\n\nEH-dimers: EH dissociation and recombination.\n\nThe EH-dimer dissociation or uncoupling energy may\nbe estimated to be on the order of 1.0-1.5 eV. The EH\ncoupling within the dimer is determined by a cumulative\n\n(15)\n\nX\ni>j\n\n+\n\nX\ni6=j\n\nVij ni nj \u2212 \u03bc\n\nhb\n(\u015di * \u015cj ) +\nJij\n\nX\ni>j\n\nX\ni\n\nni +\n\nX\ni>j\n\nbb\n(\u015di *\u015dj ) +\nJij\n\nhh\nJij\n(\u015ci * \u015cj )\n\nX\ni\n\nJiihb (\u015di * \u015ci ) . (16)\n\n\f11\n\u2020\nHere B\u0302im\ndenotes the S = 1 boson creation operator with\na spin projection m at the site i; B\u0302im is a corresponding annihilation operator. The boson number operator\n\u2020\nn\u0302im = B\u0302im\nB\u0302im at i-site due to the condition of the onsite infinitely large repulsion Vii \u2192 +\u221e (hardcore boson)\ncan take values 0 or 1.\nThe first term in (16) corresponds to the kinetic energy of the bosons, tB (ij) is the transfer integral. The\nsecond one reflects the effective repulsion (Vij > 0) of the\nbosons located on the neighboring sites. The chemical\npotential\nP \u03bc is introduced to fix the boson concentration:\nn = N1\ni hn\u0302i i . For EHBL phase in parent manganite we\narrive at the same number of electron and hole centers,\nthat is to n = 21 . The remaining terms in (16) represent\nthe Heisenberg exchange interaction between the spins\nof the hole centers (term with J hh ), spins of the hole\ncenters and the neighbor boson spins (term with J hb ),\nboson spins (term with J bb ), and the very last term in\n(16) stands for the intra-center Hund exchange between\nthe boson spin and the spin of the hole center. In order\nto account for the Hund rule one should consider Jiihb to\nbe infinitely large ferromagnetic.\nGenerally speaking, this model Hamiltonian describes\nthe system that can be considered as a Bose-analogue of\nthe one orbital double-exchange model system 2 .\nAforementioned estimates for different superexchange\ncouplings given the bond geometry typical for LaMnO3\npredict antiferromagnetic coupling of the nn hole centers\n(J hh > 0), antiferromagnetic coupling of the two nearest neighbor bosons (J bb > 0), and ferromagnetic coupling of the boson and the nearest neighbor hole centers\n(J hb < 0). In other words, we arrive at highly frustrated\nsystem of triplet bosons moving in a lattice formed by\nhole centers when the hole centers tend to order G-type\nantiferromagnetically, the triplet bosons tend to order\nferromagnetically both with respect to its own site and\nits nearest neighbors. Furthermore, nearest neighboring bosons strongly prefer an antiferromagnetic ordering.\nLastly, the boson transport prefers an overall ferromagnetic ordering.\n\nB.\n\nImplications for phase states and phase diagram\n\nBy now we have no comprehensive analysis of phase\nstates and phase diagram for the generalized triplet boson double exchange model. The tentative analysis of\nthe model in framework of a mean-field approximation\n(MFA) 52 allows to predict a very rich phase diagram even\nat half-filling (n = 12 ) with a rather conventional diagonal\nlong-range order (DLRO) with ferromagnetic insulating\nor ferromagnetic metallic phase, and unconventional offdiagonal long-range order (ODLRO) with a coexistence\nof superfluidity of triplet bosons and ferromagnetic ordering. However, it is unlikely that the MFA approach can\nprovide a relevant description of such a complex system.\nSome implications may be formulated from the comparison with familiar double exchange model 2 , singlet\n\nboson Hubbard model (see, e.g., 53 ), and with generic bismuthate oxide BaBiO3 as a well documented disproportionated system which can be described as a 3D system\nof the spin-singlet local bosons.\nIf the boson transfer to exclude we arrive at a spin system resembling that of mixed orthoferrite-orthochromite\nLaFe1\u2212x Crx O3 (nB = 12 (1 \u2212 x)) which is an G-type antiferromagnet all over the dilution range 0 < x < 1 with\nTN 's shifting from TN =740 K for LaFeO3 to TN =140 K\nfor LaCrO3 54 . However, at variance with a monovalent\n(Fe3+ -Cr3+ ) orthoferrite-orthochromite the Mn2+ -Mn4+\ncharge system in the EHBL phase would reveal a trend\nto a charge ordering, e.g. of a simple checkerboard Gtype in LaMnO3 (nB = 12 ). It is worth noting that the\nnaively expected large values of a boson-boson repulsion\nVij would result in a large temperature TCO of the charge\nordering well beyond room temperature. However, the\nmanganites must have a large dielectric function and a\nstrong screening of the repulsion, hence moderate values\nof Vnn and TCO 's predicted.\nHowever, such a scenario breaks when the boson transport is at work. It does suppress the both types of charge\nand spin ordering and we arrive most likely at an inhomogeneous system with a glass-like behavior of charge and\nspin subsystems which does or does not reveal a longrange ferromagnetic order at low temperatures. A question remains, whether the EHBL Hamiltonian (16) can\nlead to uniform solutions beyond MFA?\nAccording to experimental data 19 the novel phases in\nLaMnO3 which we relate with EHBL, exhibit a longrange ferromagnetic order below TC \u2248 140 K, however,\nwith rather small values of a mean magnetic moment,\nthat agrees with a spin inhomogeneity. It is worth noting\nthat the glass scenario implies a specific \"freezing\" temperature Tg to be a remnant of the MFA critical temperature. Such a temperature should be revealed in physical\nproperties of the system.\nWith a deviation from half-filling to nB < 21 the local\ntriplet bosons gain in freedom to move and improve their\nkinetic energy. On the other hand it is accompanied by\na sharp decrease in the number of the boson-boson pairs\nwith the most strong eg -eg antiferromagnetic coupling.\nIn other words, a ferromagnetic metallic (FM) phase becomes a main candidate to a ground state.\nInterestingly, that an intent reader can note that here\nwe describe main features of phase diagrams typical for\nhole doped manganites such as La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 . Indeed, this resemblance seems not to be accidental one\nand points to a profound role of the EHBL phase in unconventional properties of doped manganites as well.\nOne of the most intriguing and challenging issues is related with the probable superfluidity of the triplet local\nbosons. Indeed, the boson transfer integral tB defines\na maximal temperature Tmax \u2248 tB of the onset of local superconducting fluctuations in the hard-core boson\nsystems 55 . Our estimations point to Tmax \u2248 300-700 K,\nwhere the low bound is taken from theoretical estimations while the upper bound is derived from optical data\n\n\fA.\n\nOptical response of electronically phase\nseparated manganites\n\nThe CT unstable systems will be characterized by a\nwell developed volume fraction of the short- and longlived CT excitons or the EH droplets that can give rise\nto a specific optical response in a wide spectral range\ndue to different p-d and d-d CT transitions. First, these\nare the low-energy intracenter CT transitions and highenergy inverse d-d CT transitions, or EH recombination\nprocess in EH-dimers and/or nanoscopic EH centers, and\ndifferent high-energy CT transitions in electron and hole\ncenters. It is worth noting that, strictly speaking, the\noptical measurements should always display a larger volume fraction of EH droplets as compared with static or\nquasistatic measurements because these \"see\" short-lived\ndroplets as well. What are the main optical signatures of\nthe CT instability? A simplified picture implies the spectral weight transfer from the bare CT band to the CT gap\nwith an appearance of the mid-gap bands and smearing\nof the fundamental absorption edge. Such a transformation of the optical response is shown schematically in\nFig. 6. The transferred spectral weight can be easily revealed in the spectral window of the bare insulator to\nbe a direct indicator of the CT instability. It is worth\nnoting that the fragile \"matrix-droplets\" structure of the\nparent manganites makes the optical response to be very\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Optical response (schematically) of the\nself-trapped CT excitons and EH droplets (dotted curves).\nArrows point to a spectral weight transfer from the bare CT\nband to the CT gap with an appearance of the mid-gap bands\nand/or smearing of the fundamental absorption edge.\n\nsensitive to such factors as temperature, sample shape\n(bulk crystal, thin film) and quality, external magnetic\nfield, that can explain some inconsistensies observed by\ndifferent authors (see, e.g., Refs. 34,56\u201358). Great care\nis needed, if one wants to separate off the volume fraction effects to obtain the temperature behavior of spectral weight for certain band and compare the results with\nthose observed by different groups on different samples.\nCharge transfer instability and the CT exciton selftrapping in nominally pure manganites are indeed supported by the studies of their optical response.\n\n2\nLaMnO3\n\n-1\n\nAbove, in Sec.II we addressed some experimental data\nthat somehow pointed to a disproportionation scenario\nand have been used to start with a detailed analysis of a\nnovel phase.

Nevertheless, despite the fact that the emergence\nof a bulk superconductivity in a highly frustrated multicomponent EHBL phase seems to be a very uncommon\nphenomenon, the well developed local superconducting\nfluctuations can strongly influence the transport as well\nas other physical properties. A detailed analysis of the\nbosonic double-exchange model, in particular, of the offdiagonal superconducting order with the superfluidity of\nthe triplet local bosons, remains to be a challenging issue\nfor future studies.\nIt is worth noting that the electron-lattice coupling\ncan be strongly involved into the build-up of the electronic structure of the bosonic double exchange model,\nin particular, strengthening the EH dimer fluctuations.\n\nAbsorption\n\n12\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPhoton energy (eV)\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Temperature dependence of optical\nconductivity of parent LaMnO3 for E k ab (reproduced from\nRef. 56).\n\n\f13\n\ne2\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\n0.5\nDT (a.u.)\n\nLa0.93Sr0.07MnO3\n\nE (eV)\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n600\n500\n\nLaMnO3\n\n-1\n\nK (cm )\n\nAnisotropic optical conductivity spectra for a detwinned single crystal of LaMnO3 , which undergoes the\norbital ordering below TJT \u2248 780 K has been derived\nfrom the reflectivity spectra investigated by Tobe et al. 56\nover a wide temperature range, 10 K< T < 800 K (see\nFig. 7). As temperature is increased, the EH-dimers generating d \u2212 d CT transition peaked around 2 eV shows a\ndramatic loss of spectral weight with its partial transfer\nto the low energies. Simultaneously one observes a suppression of optical anisotropy. Above TJT , the gap feature becomes obscure and the anisotropy disappears completely. Such a behavior of the 2 eV band can be hardly\nexplained by the effect of spin fluctuations 34 , most likely\nit points to a shrinking of the A-AFI phase volume fraction with approaching to Tdisp =TJT and phase transition to a novel unconventional metallic-like phase. However, the optical conductivity does not reveal any signatures of Drude peak, that together with a rather large\nresistivity 9 points to an unusual charge transport.\nMain features of the optical response 56 agree with\npredictions followed from the EPS phase diagram and\nisotropic character of the optical response of EH droplets.\nHowever, the reflectivity data did not reveal any midgap\nstructures which observation and identification needs\nusually in direct absorption/transmission measurements.\nThe most detailed studies of spectral, temperature and\ndoping behavior of the midgap bands were performed\nin Refs. 58\u201360,62,63. All the manganites investigated,\nboth parent and hole/electron doped, show up two specific low-energy optical features peaked near 0.10-0.15 eV\n(0.1 eV band) and 0.3-0.6 eV (0.5 eV band), respectively.\nResults of the ellipsometric and direct absorption measurements for a single-crystaline parent LaMnO3 sample\nare shown in Fig. 8, these directly reveal both 0.1 and\n0.5 eV features in the spectral window of the bare matrix 58 . These two bands can be naturally attributed to\nthe CT transitions within the immobile EH-dimers and to\nthe dimer transport activating transitions, respectively.\nRespective energies agree with theoretical predictions, although more accurate value 0.15 eV for the \"0.1 eV\" peak\npoints most likely to an essential electron-lattice effect.\nThe 0.5 eV band in LaMnO3 was revealed by photoinduced absorption spectroscopy under light excitations\nwith the photon energy near 2.4 eV that provides optimal\nconditions for the EH pairs creation. Photoinduced absorption was observed 10 with a strong broad midinfrared\npeak centered at \u223c 5000 cm\u22121 \u2248 0.62 eV. Since the laser\nphotoexcitation and measurement are pseudocontinuous,\nthe photoexcited EH-pair lifetimes need to be quite long\nfor any significant photoexcited EH-pair density to build\nup. It means that the lattice is arranged in the appropriate relaxed state. The origin of the photoinduced (PI)\nabsorption peak was attributed 10 to the photon-assisted\nhopping of anti-Jahn-Teller polarons formed by photoexcited charge carriers. This interpretation was based on\nthe assumption of primary p-d CT transition induced by\nexcitation light with the energy h\u03bd = 2.41 eV.

Left-hand inset: photoinduced transmittance of parent LaMnO3 at T=25 K (reproduced from Ref. 10)\n\nLaMnO3 34 unambiguously points to the EH dimers to\nbe main contributor to PI absorption peak. In such a\ncase, the PI absorption peak energy (\u223c 0.6 eV) may be\nattributed to the energy of the photon-assisted hopping\nof the relaxed EH dimers (see Fig. 5) and can be used as\nan estimate of the Jahn-Teller energy \u2206JT .\nSimilar, so-called mid-gap features in nominally pure\nmanganites were directly or indirectly observed by many\nauthors. Furthermore, it seems that some authors did\nnot report the optical data below 1.5 eV to avoid the\nproblems with these odd features. Observation of the\nMIR features agrees with the scenario of well developed\nintrinsic electronic inhomogeneity inherent to nominally\nstoichiometric insulating manganites and composed of\nvolume fraction of conceivably EH droplet phase.\nFinally, it is instructive to compare the midgap absorption spectrum of parent manganite with IR optical\nspectra of chemically doped compounds to see whether\nthe nonisovalent substitution stimulates the condensation of EH-pairs and respective rise of the EH droplet\nvolume fraction. Indeed, Okimoto et al. 64 observed in\nLa0.9 Sr0.1 MnO3 a broad absorption peaked around 0.5\neV which is absent at room temperature and increases in\nintensity with decreasing temperature. In addition, the\nabsorption feature reported also shifts to lower energy\nas doping is increased, in agreement with PI measurements 10 . A mid-gap state with a similar peak energy\nand similar doping dependence was also observed at room\ntemperature by Jung et al. 65 in La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 .\n\n\f14\nThus we see that the strong and broad midinfrared\noptical feature peaked near 0.5 eV and observed in all the\nperovskite manganites studied can be surely attributed\nto the optical response of isolated EH-dimers or small EH\ndroplets edged by the JT Mn3+ centers, more precisely,\nto an optical activation of the dimer transport in such a\nsurroundings. The peak energy may be used to estimate\nthe Jahn-Teller splitting for eg levels in Mn3+ centers and\nits variation under different conditions.\n\nB.\n\nLattice effects in parent LaMnO3\n\nThe unusual abrupt unit cell volume contraction by\n0.36% has been observed by Chatterji et al. 66 in LaMnO3\nat TJT . The high-temperature phase just above TJT has\nless volume than the low-temperature phase.\nThe local structure of stoichiometric LaMnO3 across\nthe Jahn-Teller transition at TJT was studied by means\nof extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)\nat Mn K-edge 67 and high real space resolution atomic\npair distribution function (PDF) analysis 68 .\nThe\nboth techniques reveal two different Mn-O separations\n1.92 \u00c5(1.94 \u00c5) and 2.13 \u00c5(2.16 \u00c5) distributed with intensity 2:1, respectively. Comparing these separations\nwith room temperature neutron diffraction data 21 (1.907,\n1.968, and 2.178 \u00c5) the both groups point to a persistence of the JT distortions of MnO6 octahedra on crossing TJT . However, both this result and that of Chatterji\net al. 66 most likely point to a transition to Mn-O separations specific for EH-dimers, or nearest neighbor electron MnO10\u2212\n(Mn2+ ) and hole MnO10\u2212\n(Mn4+ ) centers\n6\n6\ncoupled by fast electron exchange. Anycase the picture\nis that in the high-temperature O phase the local distortions of the Mn-O separations are dynamical in character\nsimilar to those in BaBiO3 . A signature of that is an excess increase of the thermal factors of oxygen atoms in\ngoing from O' to the O phase 17 .\nThe observed Raman spectra for undoped LaMnO3\ncrystal at ambient pressure and room temperature reveal a number of additional lines, in particular, strong\n(A1g +B2g ) mode 675 cm\u22121 , which are also have been\nobserved in the spectra of doped materials and may be\nattributed to droplets of EHBL phase 69 .\nStrong variation of the LaMnO3 Raman spectra, both\nof intensity and energy shift with increasing laser power70\ncould be related to the photo-induced nucleation and the\nvolume expansion of the EH Bose-liquid. Surely, laser\nannealing can simply increase the temperature thus resulting in a A-AFI/EHBL volume fraction redistribution.\nThe strong variations of the LaMnO3 Raman spectra on\nthe excitation laser power provide evidence for a structural instability that may result in a laser-irradiationinduced structural phase transition. It is worth noting a\nstrong resonant character of the excitation of the Raman\nspecta 71 that points to a need in more extensive studies\nfocused on the search of the EH droplet response.\nThe intrinsic electronic phase separation inherent for\n\nnominally undoped stoichiometric LaMnO3 manifests itself in remarkable variations of X-ray diffraction pattern,\noptical reflectivity and Raman spectra, resistivity under\npressures up to 40 GPa 11 . The pressure induced variations of Raman spectra, in particular, a blue-shift and\nthe intensity loss of the in-phase O2 stretching B2g mode\nwith a concomittant emergence of a new peak at \u223c 45\ncm\u22121 higher in energy evidenced some kind of electronic\nphase separation with a steep rise of the volume fraction\nof the domains of a new phase within the parent A-AFI\nphase (\"sluggish\" transition 11 ). Evolution of new phase\nwas accompanied by a dramatic change of reflectance\nwhich resembles that of for LaMnO3 at ambient pressure\non heating from low temperatures to T > TJT 56 . Furthermore, the system exhibited an anomalously strong\npressure-induced fall of the room-temperature resistivity by three orders of magnitude in the range 0-30 GPa\nwith an IM transition at 32 GPa. An overall fall of resistivity in the range 0-32 GPa amounts to five orders of\nmagnitude. However, the system retains a rather high\nresistance, exhibiting a \"poor\" metallic behavior typical\nfor EHBL phase. It is worth noting that at high pressures > 30 GPa the resistivity does not reveal sizeable\ntemperature dependence between 80 and 300 K similarly\nto the high-temperature T > TJT behavior of LaMnO3\nat ambient pressure (see Ref. 9 and Fig. 1). Overall these\ndata provide a very strong support for our scenario of\nthe A-AFI/EHBL electronic phase separation in parent\nmanganite taking place without any hole/electron doping.\nThe effect of the O16 \u2192O18 isotope substitution on the\nIM transition and optical response 61 can be easily explained as a result of an energy stabilization of the parent\nA-type antiferromagnetic phase as compared with the EH\nBose liquid. The percolation mechanism of the isotope\neffect in manganites is considered in Ref. 61.\n\nC.\n\nMagnetic and resonance properties of EHBL\nphase in LaMnO3\n\nWhat about the magnetic properties of the novel\nphase? In framework of our scenario the EH Bose liquid in LaMnO3 evolves from the EH-dimers which are\nnew peculiar magnetic centers with intrinsic spin structure and with enormously large magnetic moments in\ntheir ground ferromagnetic state. However, the EH\ndimers exist as well defined entities only at very initial stage of the EHBL evolution. Within well developed EH Bose liquid we deal with a strong overlap of\nEH-dimers when these lose individuality. A tentative\nanalysis of the EH liquid phase in parent manganites 26\nshows that it may be addressed to be a triplet bosonic\nanalogue of a simple fermionic double exchange model\nwith a well developed trend to a ferromagnetic ordering.\nIt is interesting that both models have much in common that hinders their discerning. In both cases the net\nmagnetic moment of calcium(strontium)-doped mangan-\n\n\f15\nite La1\u2212x Ca(Sr)x MnO3 saturates to the full ferromagnetic value \u2248 (4 \u2212 x)\u03bcB per formula unit. Well developed ferromagnetic fluctuations within EHBL phase in\nLaMnO3 have been observed in high-temperature susceptibility measurements by Zhou and Goodenough 9 which\nmeasured the temperature dependence of paramagnetic\nsusceptibility both below and above TJT . They observed\na change from an anisotropic antiferromagnetism to an\nisotropic ferromagnetism crossing TJT accompanied by\nan abrupt rise of magnetic susceptibility. These data\npoint to an energy stabilization of the EH Bose liquid\nin an external magnetic field as compared with a parent\nA-type antiferromagnetic phase.\nThe dc magnetic susceptibility shows two distinct\nregimes 72,73 for LaMnO3 , above and below TJT . For\nT > TJT , \u03c7dc (T ) follows a Curie-Weiss (CW) law,\n\u03c7dc (T ) = C/(T \u2212 \u0398)), with C = 3.4 emu * K/mol\n(\u03bcef f \u2248 5.22\u03bcB ) and \u0398 \u2248 200 K. For T < TJT the behavior of magnetic susceptibility strongly depends on\nthe samples studied. Zhou and Goodenough 9 observed\nan abrupt fall in the Weiss constant on crossing TJT\nfrom large ferromagnetic to a small antiferromagnetic\n\u0398 \u2248 50 K, while Causa et al. 72,73 found that the CurieWeiss behavior of \u03c7dc (T ) is recovered only near room\ntemperature with a reduced antiferromagnetic \u0398 \u2248 75 K.\nInterestingly that instead of a natural suggestion of an\nelectronic phase separated state below TJT with a coexistence of low- and high-temperature phases and steep\nchange in effective \u0398, the authors 72,73 explained their\ndata as a manifestation of dramatic changes in exchange\nparameters induced by crystal distortions. They refer\nto theoretical calculations 74 which show that Jab in parent manganites is FM and decreases with the JT distortion while Jc changes from FM in the pseudocubic\nO phase to AFM in the O'-phase. However, the aforementioned estimations 46 based on the experimental data\nfor isostructural orthoferrites, orthochromites, and mixed\northoferrites-chromites point to a more reasonable antiferromagnetic orbitally averaged exchange coupling of\ntwo Mn3+ ions with bond geometry typical for LaMnO3 :\nJ \u2248 12.6 K.\nMagnetic measurements for low-hole-doped LaMnO3\nsamples 75\u201379 reveal a coexistence of antiferromagnetic\nmatrix with ferromagnetic clusters or spin glass behavior, accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis phenomena. Anomalous magnitudes of the effective magnetic\nmoment per manganese ion that considerably exceed\nexpected theoretical values, up to \u03bcef f \u2248 6\u03bcB in\nLa0.9 Sr0.1 MnO3 76 were explained to be an evidence of a\ndisproportionation 2Mn3+ \u2192Mn4+ +Mn2+ 75 or a superparamagnetic behavior of ferromagnetic clusters 76 . As a\nwhole, magnetic measurements for nearly stoichiometric\nLaMnO3 support the disproportionation scenario.\nThe ESR spectrum of LaMnO3 in a wide temperature\nrange above TN and up to temperature \u223c 800 K above\nTJT shows a single Lorentzian line with g \u223c 1.98-2.00\nand \u2206H \u223c 2400 Gauss at room temperature 72,80 . In\ncommon, the spectrum intensity follows the dc suscepti-\n\nbility, however, the consistent interpretation of the origin of ESR signal, especially in O \"pseudocubic\" phase\nis still lacking. Two different electronic phases are documented by electronic spin resonance (ESR) measurements in slightly La-deficient La0.99 MnO3 79 . Further experimental ESR studies have to be carried out to clarify\nthe issue.\nThe 55 Mn nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data\nsupport most likely the EHBL scenario. Indeed, the\nzero-field 55 Mn NMR spectrum in a nominally undoped\nLaMnO3 consists of a sharp central peak at 350 MHz due\nto bare Mn3+ O9\u2212\n6 centers and two minority signals at approximately 310 and 385 MHz 48 , that can be assigned to\n4+\na localized hole MnO8\u2212\n) center and EH-dimers\n6 (=Mn\nwith a fast bosonic exchange, respectively. Evolution\nof such a picture with Ca(Sr) doping can easily explain\na complex 55 Mn NMR lineshape in La1\u2212x Ca(Sr)x MnO3\nsamples 48,77 . It is worth noting that Tomka et al. 47 observed three 55 Mn NMR signals in a hole doped PrMnO3\naround 310, 400 and 590 MHz, which can be attributed\nto localized hole MnO8\u2212\nand electron MnO10\u2212\ncenters\n6\n6\n(narrow resonances around 310 and 590 MHz, respectively) and to EH droplets with a fast bosonic exchange\n(broad resonance around 400 MHz).\nIi is worth noting that the 55 Mn NMR lineshape in\nLa1\u2212x Ca(Sr)x MnO3 samples 48,77 with a most part of intensity shifted to a very broad line in the range 350450 MHz can hardly be explained in framework of a\nso-called DE (double exchange) line 48 with a frequency\nfDE = 21 (f (M n3+ ) + f (M n4+ )) derived from that typical for Mn3+ (350 MHz) and Mn4+ (310 MHz). Our\nscenario with a broad line centered with more or less\nredshift from a frequency specific for a high-spin state of\nthe EH-dimer: fEH = 21 (f (M n2+ ) + f (M n4+ )) \u2248 450\nMHz with f (M n2+ ) \u2248 590 MHz and f (M n4+ ) \u2248 310\nMHz is believed to be more appropriate one. It is worth\nnoting that the 55 Mn NMR response of EH-dimers can\nshed some light on several 55 Mn NMR puzzles, in particular, observation of the low-temperature (4.2 K) lowfrequency NMR lines at 260 MHz in one of nominally\nundoped LaMnO3 samples 81 and even at 100 MHz in a\nmore complex manganite (BiCa)MnO3 49 . In both cases\nwe deal seemingly with a some sort of a stabilization of\nlow-spin states for EH-dimers, for instance, due to the\nMn-O-Mn bond geometry distortions resulting in an antiferromagnetic Mn2+ -O-Mn4+ superexchange.\nThe 55 Mn NMR spectra of slightly nonstoichiometric\nLaMnO3 50 may be viewed as the most striking evidence\nof the EH dimer response in a spin inhomogeneous glasslike state. A simple comparison of experimental spectra\nwith theoretical predictions for EH dimers (see Fig. 4)\nshows a clear manifestation of the S=4,3,2 spin multiplets\nof the EH dimers with the mixing effects due to a spin\nnoncollinearity.\nMagnetic and transport properties of a singlecrystalline parent undoped manganite LaMnO3 have\nbeen studied recently under ultra-high megagauss magnetic field at helium temperatures 13 . In accordance with\n\n\f16\ntheoretical predictions 82 a sharp magnetic spin-flip transition was observed at about 70 T without visible transport anomalies. On further rising the magnetic field the\nauthors observed unusual magneto-induced IM transition\nat HIM \u223c 220 Tesla that is considerably above the field\nof the magnetic saturation of the A-AFI phase. Large\nvalues of the p \u2212 d or d \u2212 d charge transfer energies\nin bare A-AFI phase of parent manganites (\u223c 2 eV in\nLaMnO3 34 ) makes the energy difference between the AAFI ground state and any metallic phase seemingly too\nlarge to be overcomed even for magnetic fields as large\nas hundreds of Tesla. Zeeman energy associated with\nsuch a field is clearly more than an order of magnitide\nsmaller than the charge reodering energy. Thus we see\nthat a puzzling field-driven IM transition cannot be explained within a standard scenario implying the parent\nmanganite LaMnO3 to be an uniform system of the JahnTeller Mn3+ centers with an A-type antiferromagnetic order and needs in a revisit of our view on the stability of\nits ground state. However, our scenario can easily explain\nthe puzzling field driven IM transition in perovskite manganite LaMnO3 13 to be a result of a percolative transition in an inhomogeneous phase-separated A-AFI/EHBL\nstate. The volume fraction of the ferromagnetic EHBL\nphase grows in an applied magnetic field, and at a sufficiently high field this fraction reaches its percolation\nthreshold to give the IM transition. It is clear that a\nrelatively small zero-field volume fraction of novel ferromagnetic EHBL phase in the parent manganite have\nrequired large magnetic field to induce the IM transition.\n\nD.\n\nDielectric anomalies in LaMnO3\n\nThe broadband dielectric spectroscopy helps in characterizing the phase states and transitions in Mott insulator. Above we pointed to anomalous electric polarisability of the EH dimers and EH droplets that would result\nin dielectric anomalies in the EHBL phase and the phaseseparated state of LaMnO3 . Indeed, such anomalies were\nreported recently both for poly- and single-crystalline\nsamples of parent LaMnO3 12 . First of all, one should\nnote relatively high static dielectric constant in LaMnO3\nat T = 0 (\u03b50 \u223c 18 \u2212 20) approaching to values typical\nfor genuine multiferroic systems (\u03b50 \u2248 25), whereas for\nthe conventional nonpolar systems, \u03b50 varies within 1-5.\nThe entire \u03b5\u2032 (\u03c9, T )- T pattern across 77-900 T has two\nprominent features: (i) near TN and (ii) near TJT to\nbe essential signatures of puzzlingly unexpected multiferroicity. Far below TN , \u03b5\u2032 (\u03c9, T ) is nearly temperature\nand frequency independent, as expected. Following the\nanomaly at TN , \u03b5\u2032 (\u03c9, T ) rises with T by 5 orders of magnitude near TJT . Finally, \u03b5\u2032 becomes nearly temperature\nindependent beyond TJT . The P-E loop does not signify\nany ferroelectric order yet the time-dependence plot resembles the \"domain-switching-like\" pattern. The finite\nloop area signifies the presence of irreversible local domain fluctuations. From these results, it appears that\n\nthe intrinsic electrical polarization probably develops locally with no global ferroelectric order.\nThe nature of the anomaly at TJT varies with the increase in Mn4+ concentration following a certain trend\nfrom a sharp upward feature to a smeared plateau and\nthen a downward feature to finally, a rather broader\ndownward peak.\nThe observation of an intrinsic dielectric response in\nglobally centrosymmetric LaMnO3 , where no ferroelectric order is possible due to the absence of off-centre\ndistortion in MnO6 octahedra cannot be explained in\nframes of the conventional uniform antiferromagnetic insulating A-AFI scenario and agrees with the electronic\nA-AFI/EHBL phase separated state with a coexistence\nof non-polar A-AFI phase and highly polarisable EHBL\nphase.\n\nE.\n\nComment on the experimental non-observance\nof new phase in LaMnO3\n\nBy now there has been no systematic exploration of\nexact valence and spin state of Mn in perovskite manganites. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)\nmeasurements Oseroff et al. 80 suggested that below 600\nK in LaMnO3 there are no isolated Mn atoms of valence\n+2, +3, +4, however they argued that EPR signals are\nconsistent with a complex magnetic entity composed of\nMn ions of different valence.\nPark et al.83 attempted to support the Mn3+ /Mn4+\nmodel, based on the Mn 2p x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPES) and O1s absorption. However, the significant discrepancy between the weighted Mn3+ /Mn4+\nspectrum and the experimental one for given x suggests\na more complex doping effect. Subias et al.84 examined\nthe valence state of Mn utilizing Mn K-edge x-ray absorption near edge spectra (XANES), however, a large\ndiscrepancy is found between experimental spectra given\nintermediate doping and appropriate superposition of the\nend members.\nThe valence state of Mn in Ca-doped LaMnO3 was\nstudied by high-resolution Mn K\u03b2 emission spectroscopy\nby Tyson et al.85 . No evidence for Mn2+ was claimed\nat any x values seemingly ruling out proposals regarding the Mn3+ disproportionation. However, this conclusion seems to be absolutely unreasonable one. Indeed,\nelectron center MnO10\u2212\ncan be found in two configu6\nration with formal Mn valence Mn2+ and Mn1+ (not\nsimple Mn2+ ), respectively. In its turn, the hole center\ncan be found in two configuration with formal\nMnO8\u2212\n6\nMn valence Mn4+ and Mn3+ (not simple Mn4+ ), respeccan\ntively. Furthermore, even the bare center MnO9\u2212\n6\nbe found in two configuration with formal Mn valence\nMn3+ and Mn2+ (not simple Mn3+ ), respectively. So,\nwithin the model the Mn K\u03b2 emission spectrum for the\nCa-doped LaMnO3 has to be a superposition of appropriately weighted Mn1+ , Mn2+ , Mn3+ , and Mn4+ contributions (not simple Mn4+ and Mn3+ , as one assumes in\n\n\f17\nRef. 85). Unfortunately, we do not know the Mn K\u03b2\nemission spectra for the oxide compounds with Mn1+\nions, however a close inspection of the Mn K\u03b2 emission\nspectra for the series of Mn oxide compounds with Mn\nvalence varying from 2+ to 7+ (Fig. 2 in Ref. 85) allows\nto uncover a rather clear dependence on valence, and\nindicates a possibility to explain the experimental spectrum for Ca-doped LaMnO3 (ibid, Fig. 4a) as a superposition of appropriately weighted Mn1+ , Mn2+ , Mn3+ ,\nand Mn4+ contributions. Later 86 it has been shown that\nMn L edge absorption rather than that of K edge is completely dominated by Mn 3d states and, hence, is an excellent indicator of Mn oxidation state and coordination.\nInterestingly that the results of the X-ray absorption and\nemission spectroscopy in vicinity of the Mn L23 edge 87\nprovide a striking evidence of a coexistence of Mn3+ and\nMn2+ valent states in a single crystalline LaMnO3 .\nThis set of conflicting data together with a number of\nadditional data88 suggests the need for an in-depth exploration of the Mn valence problem in this perovskite\nsystem. However, one might say, the doped manganites\nare not only systems with mixed valence, but systems\nwith indefinite valence, where we cannot, strictly speaking, unambiguously distinguish Mn species with either\ndistinct valence state.\nIt seems, by now there are no techniques capable of\ndirect and unambiguous detection of new electron-hole\nBose liquid. However, we do not see any sound objections\nagainst such a scenario that is shown to explain a main\nbody of experimental data.\n\nVII.\n\nHOLE DOPING OF PARENT MANGANITE\n\nEvolution of the electronic structure of nominally insulating 3d oxides under a nonisovalent substitution as\n2+\nin La3+\n1\u2212x Srx MnO3 remains one of the challenging problems in physics of strong correlations. A conventional\nmodel approach focuses upon a hole doping and implies\na change in the (quasi)particle occupation in the valent\nband or a hole localization in either cation 3d orbital or\nanion O 2p orbital, or in a proper hybridized molecular orbital. However, in the 3d oxides unstable with regard to a charge transfer such as parent manganites one\nshould expect just another scenario when the nonisovalent substituents do form the nucleation centers for the\nEH droplets thus provoking the first order phase transition into a novel EH disproportionated phase with a\nproper deviation from a half-filling.\nConventional double exchange model implies the manganese location of the doped hole and its motion in the\nlattice formed by nominal parent manganite 2 . However,\nby now there are very strong hints at oxygen location of\ndoped holes. One might point to several exciting experimental results supporting the oxygen nature of holes in\nmanganites. The first is a direct observation of the O\n2p holes in the O 1s x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements 89 . Second, Tyson et al. 85 in their Mn K\u03b2\n\nemission spectra studies of the Ca-doped LaMnO3 have\nobserved an \"arrested\" Mn-valence response to the doping in the x < 0.3 range, also consistent with creation\nof predominantly oxygen holes. Third, Galakhov et al. 90\nhave reported Mn 3s x-ray emission spectra in mixedvalence manganites and shown that the change in the\nMn formal valency from 3 to 3.3 is not accompanied by\nany decrease in the Mn 3s splitting. They have proposed\nthat this effect can be explained by the appearance in the\nground-state configuration of holes in the O 2p states.\nThe oxygen location of the doped holes is partially supported by observation of anomalously large magnitude of\nsaturated magnetic moments in ferromagnetic state for\ndifferent doped manganites75,76 .\nTwo oxygen-hole scenarios are possible. The first implies the hole doping directly to bare A-AFI phase of parent manganite. Given light doping we arrive at the hole\ntrapping in potential wells created by the substituents\nsuch as Ca2+ , Sr2+ or cation vacancies. This gives rise to\nevolution of hole-rich, orbitally disordered ferromagnetic\nphase. The volume fraction of this phase increases with x,\nand ferromagnetic ordering within this phase introduces\nspin-glass behavior where the ferromagnetic phase does\nnot percolate in zero magnetic field H=0; but growth of\nthe ferromagnetic phase to beyond percolation in a modest field can convert the spin glass to a bulk ferromagnetic insulator. On further increasing the hole doping the\nferromagnetic metallic ground state is obtained with itinerant oxygen holes and degenerate eg orbitals of Mn3+\nions.\nIn second scenario one proposes that doped holes trigger the phase transition to an \"asymmetrically\" disproportionated phase with nominal non-JT Mn2+ ions and\noxygen holes that can form a band of itinerant carriers.\nThis scenario implies that the doped holes simply change\na hole band filling.\nThe both scenario imply an unconventional system\nwith two, Mn 3d and O 2p, unfilled shells. One should\nnote that despite a wide-spread opinion the correlation\neffects for the oxygen holes can be rather strong. These\ncould provide a coexistence of the two (manganese and\noxygen) nonfilled bands.\nSuch a p \u2212 d model with ferromagnetic p \u2212 d coupling\nimmediately explains many unconventional properties of\nthe hole doped manganites. First of all, at low hole content we deal with hole localization in impurity potential.\nThen, given further hole doping a percolation threshold\noccurs accompanied by insulator-anionic oxygen metal\nphase transition and ferromagnetic ordering both in oxygen and Mn sublattices, due to a strong ferromagnetic\nHeisenberg pd exchange. However, it should be noted\nthat ferromagnetic sign of pd exchange is characteristic\nof nonbonding p and d orbitals.\nThe oxygen hole doping results in a strong spectral\nweight transfer from the intense O2p-Mn3d CT transition bands to the O2p band developed. The Mn3+ d \u2212 d\ntransitions will gradually shift to the low energies due to\na partial O2p hole screening of the crystalline field. In\n\n\f18\na whole, optical data do not disprove the oxygen hole\nscenario.\nDespite many controversial opinions regarding the electronic structure of doped holes the current description of\ncomplex phase diagrams for doped manganites implies a\nwell-developed phase separation with coexistence of bare\nantiferromagnetic and several ferromagnetic phases 2,91 .\nWhat is the role played by the EHBL phase inherent for\nparent manganites?\nHole doping of parent manganite is produced by a\nnonisovalent substitution as in La1\u2212x Srx MnO3 or by an\noxygen nonstoichiometry. The Sr2+ , Ca2+ substituents\nform effective trapping centers for the EH dimers and\nthe nucleation centers for the EH Bose liquid. At a\ncritical substituent concentration xc \u2248 0.16 one arrives at a percolation threshold 3 when the conditions\nfor an itinerant particle hopping do emerge. Holes are\ndoped into EH Bose liquid of parent LaMnO3 similar\nto generic BaBiO3 system only pairwise, transforming\nformally electron MnO10\u2212\ncenter to hole MnO8\u2212\ncen6\n6\nter. Similarly to BaBiO3 doped hole centers form local\ncomposite bosons which shift the system from half-filling\n(nB = 1/2).\nIt seems the EHBL phase addressed above appears to\nbe an important precursor for a ferromagnetic metallic phase responsible for colossal magnetoresistance observed in doped manganites. Existence of such an intermediate \"poor metallic\" phase seems to be essential\nfor a transformation of bare insulating A-AFI phase to\na \"good-metallic\" phase under hole doping. Low-energy\nCT excitations typical for EHBL phase and well exhibited in optical response (see Figs. 7,8) give rise to a significant screening of electrostatic interactions and to a\nsuppression of localization trend for doped charge carriers with their escape out of charge traps and the evolution of itineracy. This trend is well illustrated in Fig. 8,\nwhere the dielectric function \u03b52 is shown both for parent and slightly hole doped LaMnO3 . We see a clear\nred-shift both for low-energy (2 eV) d \u2212 d CT band and\nhigh-energy (4.5 eV) p \u2212 d CT band with a rise of intensity for both bands, particularly sharp for the 2 eV band.\nAll these effects evidence the lowering of effective values\nfor the charge transfer energies, that is a clear trend to\n\"metallicity\".\nOne of the intriguing issues is related with seemingly\nmasked superconducting fluctuations in doped manganites and its relation to colossal magnetoresistance. Indeed, doped manganites reveal many properties typical\nfor superconducting materials or, rather, unconventional\nsuperconductors such as cuprates. Kim 92 has proposed\nthe frustrated p-wave pairing superconducting state similar to the A1 state in superfluid He-3 to explain CMR,\nthe sharp drop of resistivity, the steep jump of specific\nheat, and the gap opening in tunneling of manganese oxides. In this scenario, colossal magnetoresistance (CMR)\nis naturally explained by the superconducting fluctuation\nwith increasing magnetic fields. This idea is closely related to the observation of anomalous proximity effect\n\nbetween superconducting YBCO and a manganese oxide, La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 or La1\u2212x Srx MnO3 93 , and also the\nconcept of local superconductivity manifested by doped\nmanganites 94 .\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo summarize, we do assign anomalous properties of\nparent manganite LaMnO3 to charge transfer instabilities and competition between insulating A-AFM phase\nand metallic-like dynamically disproportionated phase\nformally separated by a first-order phase transition at\nTdisp = TJT \u2248 750 K. We report a comprehensive elaboration of a so-called \"disproportionation\" scenario in manganites which was addressed earlier by many authors,\nhowever, by now it was not properly developed. The unconventional high-temperature phase is addressed to be\na specific electron-hole Bose liquid rather than a simple\n\"chemically\" disproportionated R(Mn2+ Mn4+ )O3 phase.\nWe arrive at highly frustrated system of triplet (e2g )3 A2g\nbosons moving in a lattice formed by hole Mn4+ centers when the latter tend to order G-type antiferromagnetically, the triplet bosons tend to order ferromagnetically both with respect to its own site and its nearest\nneighbors, nearest neighboring bosons strongly prefer an\nantiferromagnetic ordering. Lastly, the boson transport\nprefers an overall ferromagnetic ordering.\nStarting with different experimental data we have\nreproduced a typical temperature dependence of the\nvolume fraction of the high-temperature mixed-valent\nEHBL phase. New phase nucleates as a result of the\nCT instability and evolves from the self-trapped CT excitons, or specific EH-dimers, which seem to be a precursor\nof both insulating and metallic-like ferromagnetic phases\nobserved in manganites. We present a detailed analysis of\nelectronic structure, energy spectrum, optical, magnetic\nand resonance properties of EH-dimers. We argue that\na slight nonisovalent substitution, photo-irradiation, external pressure or magnetic field give rise to an electronic\nphase separation with a nucleation or an overgrowth of\nEH-droplets. Such a scenario provides a comprehensive\nexplanation of numerous puzzling properties observed in\nparent and nonisovalently doped manganite LaMnO3 including an intriguing manifestation of superconducting\nfluctuations.\nWe argue that the unusual 55 Mn NMR spectra of nonisovalently doped manganites LaMnO3 may be addressed\nto be a clear signature of a quantum disproportionation\nand formation of EH-dimers. Given the complex phase\nseparation diagram of this class of materials, the study\nof the nominally stoichiometric parent compound could\ngive a deep insight into the physics governing the doped\nversion of these manganese oxides. It would be important to verify the expectations of EHBL scenario by more\nextensive and goaled studies.\nI thank N. N. Loshkareva, Yu. P. Sukhorukov, K. N.\nMikhalev, Yu. B. Kudasov and V. V.
