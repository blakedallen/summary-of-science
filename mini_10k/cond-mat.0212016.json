Its rather general\ncharacter and simplicity makes it extremely suitable for versatile applications. Traditionally\nit was applied in quantum chemistry1 and in collision theory2 ,3 . A recent treatment of\nthe experiments on the quantum molecular hysteresis in nanomagnets by Wernsdorfer and\nSessoli4,5,6 was a real triumph of the LZ theory. A substantial contributions to the theory of\nspin tunnelling in these molecules was made by theorists7,8,9 . Landau-Zener formula and its\ngeneralizations were recently employed also for charge transport in nanostructures10,11,12,13,14 ,\nBose-Einstein condensates15 and quantum computing16 .\nExtensions of the LZ theory to the case of multilevel crossing are less general. Nevertheless, some of them were realistic enough to justify remarkable efforts on the side of theorists\nfor their analysis. Level correlations and localization in energy space were studied in17 . The\npioneering work by Demkov and Osherov18 treated exactly the crossing of a single level with\na band of parallel levels. In the work19 Hioe and Carrol solved a problem of transitions in\na Zeeman multiplet of an arbitrary spin S in a magnetic field with a constant perpendicular\ncomponent and a time-dependent parallel component passing through zero value. Numerous\ngeneralizations of these results were found20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27 . A general point of view on all\nthese exactly solvable models proposed by one of authors28 allowed to construct an algorithm\nfor series of new solvable models. Another extensions include nonlinear LZ-model29,30,31 and\nLZ problem with nonlinear sweep32 . To apply the LZ formula and its multi-state extensions\nto real systems it is often necessary to take into account the interaction with environment.\nSuch attempts were made in a series of works8,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45 , however the\nproblem was not solved completely. Kayanuma et al.33,34,35 have obtained an elegant analytic result for the diagonal white noise. The non-diagonal colored noise was considered\nby Kayanuma36 for the two-level crossing without a constant coupling term. He has found\nthe transition probability in the limit of infinitely short noise correlation time. His result\nwas disputed by Nishino et al.37 . On the basis of their numerical calculations these authors\nconcluded that the transitions due to non-diagonal noise are weak in many realistic situations. The discrepancy is associated with different limiting procedures in calculations. In\nthe limit of infinitely short correlations but finite amplitude of sweeping field the transition\n2\n\n\fprobability was found to be vanishingly small.\nThe influence of the noise onto the multilevel crossing was studied so far in only one work\nby Saito and Kayanuma38 , who considered the 3-level crossing at a special relations between\nparameters in the limit of strong decoherence.\nThe purpose of this article is to present a systematic study of the influence of noise,\nincluding the colored noise, onto the LZ transitions and to generalize it to multistate LZ\nproblems. We demonstrate that the LZ transitions are sensitive to the colored noise much\nweaker than usual \u03b4-like white noise. The latter can be considered as a limit of a noise\nwhose correlation time goes to zero and simultaneously its square of amplitude goes to\ninfinity, so that their product remains a constant. We prove that such a white non-diagonal\nnoise always leads to equal population of the crossing levels. However, the noise, whose\ncorrelation time goes to zero, but its amplitude remains a constant, produces non-trivial\ntransition probabilities as it was first found by Kayanuma36 for a special type of the noise\ncorrelation function. Another subtle problem is the order of limiting processes37 . The\nresulting probabilities depend crucially on what happens first: time asymptotically goes to\ninfinity or correlation time goes to zero. Analysis of these problems allowed us to reconcile\nworks36 and37 . In our work we first find simple analytical result for a transition produced\nby a most general short-time correlated noise in 2-level systems and the change of the LZ\nprobabilities produced by such a noise. We check these analytical results by numerical\ncalculations. We also study the influence of the noise on transitions at multilevel crossing.\nThe plan of the article is as follows. In section II we generalize the result of Kayanuma\nfor transverse noise36 to the case of the arbitrary Gaussian noise in all three directions. Next\nwe demonstrate its generalization to a three level system. In the section IV we study the\ntime dependence of the density matrix with LZ transitions stimulated by fast noise. In the\nfifth section we propose a formula that incorporates constant transverse magnetic field and\ncompare its predictions with numerical simulations. In section VI we consider the master\nequation for an arbitrary spin placed into a regular varying field and noisy magnetic field\nalong the z-direction and a constant field along x-direction and find simple expressions for\ntransition probabilities in the limit of a strong decoherence. In section VII we perform\nsimilar calculations for a charged particle on a periodic chain driven by a time-dependent\nelectric field and compare our results with those for a completely coherent evolution.\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nCOLORED NOISE IN TWO LEVEL LZ TRANSITIONS.\n\nLZ transitions in a two-level system with a non-diagonal noise were studied by Kayanuma\nin36 . The Hamiltonian of the problem was chosen to be\nH = \u03b2t\u03c3z + \u03b7x \u03c3x\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b7x is the noise field with the correlation function h\u03b7x (t1 )\u03b7x (t2 )i = Jx2 e\u2212\u03bbx |t1 \u2212t2 | and \u03c3i\nare Pauli matrices. In the limit of infinitely short correlation time \u03bb \u2192 \u221e Kayanuma has\nfound a simple analytical result for the transition probability.\nThe choice of Kayanuma corresponds to the spin 1/2 problem with noisy magnetic field\nalong the x-axes only. We generalize the Kayanuma model introducing a more general\nHamiltonian with all 3 components of random magnetic field being non-zero and with a\nmost general form of the short-time correlation tensor:\nH = \u03b2t\u03c3z +\n\nX\n\n\u03b7i (t)\u03c3i , i = x, y, z\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nh\u03b7i (t1 )\u03b7j (t2 )i = gij (\u03bb|t1 \u2212 t2 |)\n\n(3)\n\nWe assume that though gij can be different for different i, j, they are of the same order\nof magnitude. We consider the limit of fast noise with \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, where \u03bb is the inverse\ncharacteristic decay time of the correlator gij .\nThe density matrix elements for the system with the Hamiltonian (1) obey the following\nsystem of ordinary differential equations:\ni\u03c1\u0307 = 2(\u2212\u03c112 (\u03b7x \u2212 i\u03b7y ) + \u03c121 (\u03b7x + i\u03b7y ))\ni\u03c1\u030712 = 2(\u03b2t + \u03b7z )\u03c112 \u2212 \u03c1(\u03b7x + i\u03b7y )\n\n(4)\n\ni\u03c1\u030721 = \u22122(\u03b2t + \u03b7z )\u03c121 + \u03c1(\u03b7x \u2212 i\u03b7y )\nwhere \u03c1 = \u03c111 \u2212 \u03c122 . By elimination of non-diagonal matrix elements equations (4) are\ntransformed into one integral-differential equation for the occupation difference \u03c1:\nd\u03c1(t)\ndt\n\n\u2212i\u03b2t2\n\n= \u22122e\n2\n\n(\u03b7x (t) \u2212 i\u03b7y (t))\n\n\u22122ei\u03b2t (\u03b7x (t) + i\u03b7y (t))\n\nRt\n\ni\u03b2t21 \u2212i\n\nRt\n\nRt\n\n\u2212\u221e dt1 e\nRt\n\u2212i\u03b2t21 +i\n\u03b7z (t2 )dt2\n\n\u2212\u221e dt1 e\n\nt1\n\nt1\n\n\u03b7z (t2 )dt2\n\n(\u03b7x (t1 ) + i\u03b7y (t1 ))\u03c1(t1 )\n\n(5)\n\n(\u03b7x (t1 ) \u2212 i\u03b7y (t1 ))\u03c1(t1 )\n\nThe solution of this equation can be formally found as an infinite series in powers of\n\u03b7i that must be averaged over noise realizations. A typical term contains the product\n4\n\n\f\u03b7i1 (t1 )\u03b7i2 (t2 ) . . . \u03b7in (tn ). Its average is equal to the sum of all possible products of pair\ncorrelators since we assume the noise to be Gaussian. Kayanuma36 has shown that in the\nlimit of very fast noise only the term in which the pairing is ideally ordered in time, i.e.\nthe pairs are (12)(34)...(2n-1,2n), contributes a finite value into the integral. Other pairings\ncontribute terms, which are by a power of infinitely small parameter 1/\u03bb smaller and can\nbe neglected. This Kayanuma's observation is completely analogues to the theorem proven\nby Abrikosov and Gor'kov in their theory of impurities in a metal46 . Note that the diagonal\ncomponent of noise is inessential in this approximation and can be omitted. These facts\nallow to write down the integral-differential equation for the average value of \u03c1 as follows:\nZ t\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndh\u03c1i(t)\n= \u22124\ncos \u03b2(t2 \u2212 t21 ) F (\u03bb|t \u2212 t1 |) h\u03c1i(t1 )dt1\ndt\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(6)\n\nwhere F = gxx + gyy . Now we can employ the approximation of the fast noise assuming\nthat the average h\u03c1i(t) almost does not change in the interval of time 1/\u03bb and that integral\nof correlation function is convergent. In this approximation we can extract h\u03c1i(t) from the\nintegral in the right-hand side of equation (6) and expand the argument of the cosine near\nthe end point t1 = t of the integral. The resulting differential equation reads:\ndh\u03c1i\n= \u22124F\u0302 (2\u03b2t)h\u03c1i\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nwhere F\u0302 (q) is the cosine Fourier transform of the function F :\nF\u0302 (q) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ncos(q\u03c4 )F (\u03bb|\u03c4 |)d\u03c4\n\n(8)\n\nNote that the characteristic value of q are of the order \u03bb and, respectively, essential values\nof t in equation (7) are t \u223c \u03bb/\u03b2. We see that essential values of time go to infinity together\nwith \u03bb. It shows that the order of limiting processes is indeed very important. Here we\nfirst calculate the transition probability, i.e. the diagonal elements of the density matrix at\nt = \u221e and at very large, but still finite \u03bb and put it infinity in the end.

It means that their values at t = t\u2032 become infinitely large. In particular\n\nit means that F (0) is infinitely large for the standard white noise. In this case, as it is\nseen from equations (11), (12) the occupancies of both levels are equal to 1/2. Thus, the\nstandard white noise leads to complete loss of initial state memory and equipartition of the\nlevels. On the other hand, if the amplitude of noise remains finite, the occupation numbers\nconserve memory on the initial state.\nIn the limit of the fast noise the transition probabilities are determined only by the average\nsquare of non-diagonal noise and are not sensitive to the diagonal noise. To illustrate this\nstatement we consider a special case when the diagonal noise does not correlate with the\nnon-diagonal one. Then, as it is seen from equation (5), the averaging over the z-component\nof the noise leads to multiplication of the coefficients in this integral-differential equation by\nthe Debye-Waller factor\nhexp\n\n\u0012Z\n\nt\n\nt1\n\n\u03b7z (\u03c4 )d\u03c4 i\n\n1\n= exp \u2212 (t \u2212 t1 )\n2\u03bb\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ngzz (\u03b8)d\u03b8\n\n\u0013\n\nAn essential interval of integration over t1 near t1 = t is 1/\u03bb.

However,\nin a situation of a general position only two levels cross. Several levels can intersect at the\nsame moment of time only due to a special symmetry. Such a symmetry is systematically\nrealized in the model of an arbitrary spin S 6= 1/2 placed into an external magnetic field\nthat has a time-dependent z-component vanishing at some moment of time t = 0 and a\nconstant transverse component19 . The corresponding Hamiltonian is:\nH = \u03b2tSz + gSx\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03b2 and g are constants. This exactly solvable model for a spin higher than 1/2 was\nemployed in the theory of Stark effect47 ; some recent applications can be found in48,49 .\nIn this section we generalize the result (13) to a spin 1 system. We consider a following\nHamiltonian for the spin 1 system in a random magnetic field:\nH = (\u03b2t)Sz +\n\n+1\nX\n\n\u03b7i Si\n\n(16)\n\ni=\u22121\n\nwhere Si are the spin projection operators for S = 1. The density matrix \u03c1 depends on 8\nindependent parameters. We denote \u03c1+ = \u03c11,1 \u2212 \u03c10,0 and \u03c1\u2212 = \u03c1\u22121,\u22121 \u2212 \u03c10,0 . The derivation\nof equations for \u03c1+ and \u03c1\u2212 can be done in the same spirit as it was done for the spin 1/2\ncase. Looking for a solution of the evolution equation for density matrix in the form of\nperturbation series and retaining after the averaging over the noise only the leading terms\nin 1/\u03bb, we arrive at an integral-differential equation. Additional care must be paid to the\nintegrals of the form\n\nRt\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt1\n\nR t1\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt2 exp(i\u03b2(t21 + t22 ))gij (\u03bb|t1 \u2212 t2 |) that did not appear in\n\nthe two level system, but appeared in the series for the spin S = 1. One can check that\nthis integral is of the order 1/\u03bb and hence we disregard it and all terms that contain it.\nAfter lengthy but straightforward calculations we find that in the leading order in 1/\u03bb the\nelements \u03c1+ (t) and \u03c1\u2212 (t) satisfy the following integral-differential equation:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nRt\nd \uf8ec \u03c1+ (t) \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 1/2 \uf8f7 \uf8ec \u03c1+ (t1 ) \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 = \u22122 \u2212\u221e dt1 cos(\u03b2(t2 \u2212 t21 )/2)F (\u03bb|t \u2212 t1 |) \uf8ed\n\uf8ed\ndt \u03c1\u2212 (t)\n\u03c1\u2212 (t1 )\n1/2 1\n\n7\n\n(17)\n\n\fThe approximation of the fast noise allows to transform this equation into the following\ndifferential one:\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\n\uf8eb\n\nd \uf8ec \u03c1+ (t) \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 1/2 \uf8f7 \uf8ec \u03c1+ (t1 ) \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 = \u22122F\u0302 (\u03b2t) \uf8ed\n\uf8ed\ndt \u03c1\u2212 (t)\n\u03c1\u2212 (t1 )\n1/2 1\n\n(18)\n\nThus, the problem is reduced to a linear differential equation with a constant matrix coefficient.

It is useful to look at the same problem from a different\n8\n\n\fpoint of view. Namely, we will analyze the behavior of transitions driven by the standard\n\u03b4-like white noise, their typical rates and times. If the action of the standard white noise is\nlimited by some finite time interval, it becomes physically equivalent to the fast noise with\na finite amplitude. Simultaneously we will study directly the influence of the white noise\nonto the LZ transitions.\nLet us consider the problem with the very beginning. The Hamiltonian is the generator\nof a random rotation:\nH = h(t)S\n\n(22)\n\nwhere h(t) = h0 (t) + \u03b7(t) and h0 (t) = \u03b2t\u1e91 + \u0393x\u0302. Here we consider the isotropic white noise\nh\u03b7i (t)\u03b7k (t\u2032 )i = \u03b3\u03b4ik \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\nThe density matrix as any Hermitian S \u00d7 S matrix can be represented as a sum:\n2\n(1)\n(2)\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(0) I + \u03c1i Si + \u03c1ik Si Sk + Sk Si \u2212 S(S + 1) + ...\n3\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the last term in equation (29) contains S operator factors. All irreducible tensors\n\u03c1(j) ; j = 0...S evolve separately. The scalar \u03c1(0) = (1/N)T r\u03c1 is a constant. The vector \u03c1(1)\nobeys an obvious equation:\n \u0307 = \u2212h \u00d7 \u03c1(1)\n\u03c1(1)\n\n(24)\n\nThe modulus of the vector \u03c1~(1) is conserved.\nDynamic equation for the 2-nd order symmetric tensor \u03c1ik reads:\n\u03c1\u0307ik = \u2212\u01ebimn hm \u03c1nk \u2212 \u01ebkmn hm \u03c1in\n\n(25)\n\nThe extension for the rest of irreducible components is obvious. In equation (24) for the\nvectorial part it is useful to apply the interaction representation: \u03c1(1) (t) = U0 (t, t0 )\u03c1\u0303(1) (t),\nwhere U0 (t, t0 ) is the evolution matrix for the field h0 (t) = \u1e91\u03b2t + x\u0302\u0393. The reduced vector\n\u03c1\u0303(1) (t) obeys the following equation:\nd (1)\n\u03c1\u0303 (t) = \u2212\u03b7\u0303 \u00d7 \u03c1\u0303(1) (t)\ndt\n\n(26)\n\nHere \u03b7\u0303 = U0\u22121 (\u03b7 \u00d7 U0 ). In terms of the Cartesian coordinates this equation reads:\n\u03c1\u0303 \u0307 i = Tikl \u03c1\u0303k \u03b7l\n\n(27)\n\nTikl (t, t0 ) = (U0 )mi (U0 )nk \u01ebmln\n\n(28)\n\nwhere the matrix Tikl is:\n\n9\n\n\fInitial values of \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0303 coincide since U0 (t0 , t0 ) = I. Equation (27) can be solved by power\nexpansion over the noise:\n\u03c1\u0303i (t) = \u03c1i (t0 ) +\n\nt\n\nZ\n\nt0\n\nTikl (t\u2032 , t0 )\u03b7l (t\u2032 )dt\u03c1k (t0 ) + ...\n\n(29)\n\nWhen averaging the expansion over the noise, all odd terms vanish. To understand what\nhappens with even terms consider first the quadratic term:\nZ\n\nt\nt0\n\ndt1\n\nZ\n\nt1\n\nt0\n\ndt2 Tik1 l1 (t1 , t0 )Tk1 ,k,l2 (t2 , t0 )h\u03b7l1 (t1 )\u03b7l2 (t2 )i\u03c1k (t0 )\n\nFor the isotropic noise the contribution to the vector \u03c1\u0303(t) up to the second order in \u03b7 can\nbe represented as follows (we write equations for averages omitting the angular brackets):\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1\u03032,i (t) = \u03b4ik +\n\nZ\n\nt\nt0\n\n\u0013\n\ndt1 Mik (t1 ) \u03c1k (t0 )\n\n(30)\n\nwhere\nMik (t) = (\u03b3/2)Timl (t, t0 )Tmkl (t, t0 ) = \u2212\u03b3\u03b4ik\n\n(31)\n\nHere we have used properties of the orthogonal matrices U0 : (U0 )mi (U0 )mk = \u03b4ik .\nNext we proceed to the quartic term:\n\u03c1\u03034,i =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt0\n\ndt1\n\nZ\n\nt1\n\nt0\n\ndt2\n\nZ\n\nt2\n\nt0\n\ndt3\n\nZ\n\nt3\n\ndt4 Tipk (t1 , t0 )Tpql (t2 , t0 )Tqrm (t3 , t0 )Trsn (t4 , t0 )\n\nt0\n\n\u00d7 h\u03b7k (t1 )\u03b7l (t2 )\u03b7m (t3 )\u03b7n (t4 )i\u03c1s (t0 )\n\n(32)\n\nQuartic average of Gaussian field decays into quadratic averages:\nh\u03b7k (t1 )\u03b7l (t2 )\u03b7m (t3 )\u03b7n (t4 )i = h\u03b7k (t1 )\u03b7l (t2 )ih\u03b7m (t3 )\u03b7n (t4 )i\n+h\u03b7k (t1 )\u03b7m (t3 )ih\u03b7l (t2 )\u03b7n (t4 )i + h\u03b7k (t1 )\u03b7n (t4 )ih\u03b7l (t2 )\u03b7m (t3 )i\n\n(33)\n\nOnly the first term contributes to the integral (32). Two others are zero at correct time\nordering t1 \u2265 t2 \u2265 t3 \u2265 t4 . In both cases considered earlier we obtain:\n\u03c1\u03034,i =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt0\n\ndt1\n\nZ\n\nt1\n\nt0\n\ndt2 Mij (t1 )Mjk (t2 )\u03c1k (t0 )\n\n(34)\n\nThe same result could be obtained from an effective equation of motion for \u03c1\u0303:\n\u03c1\u0303 \u0307 i = Mik \u03c1\u0303k\nThus, the operator M plays the role of effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.\n10\n\n(35)\n\n\fFor the white isotropic noise the solution of the equation (35) is:\n\u03c1\u0303i (t) = \u03c1\u0303i (t0 )exp(\u2212\u03b3t)\n\n(36)\n\nAt t \u2192 \u221e the formula (36) always leads to the occupation numbers p = 1/2. As we know,\nthis does not happen for the colored noise with a finite amplitude. The reason is that in the\ngenuine LZ problem the solution strongly oscillates with the frequency roughly \u03c9(t) \u223c \u03b2t\nlong before and after the level crossing point. This introduces a new energy scale that must\nbe compared with \u03bb. For time in the range |\u03b2t| < \u03bb, the approximation of white noise is\nroughly valid even for finite amplitude noise, but beyond this interval of time the oscillations\nof the LZ solution become faster than the correlation time of the noise, and the action of\nthe noise is suppressed by the oscillations.\nIn F ig.1 we demonstrate a typical evolution of the probability for the system to stay in the\nsame state as a function of time. The evolution reminds diffusive motion that slowly stops\nat large absolute values of time. The sharp change of the absolute value of the amplitude\nnear t = 0 is due to the constant transverse field.\nTo estimate roughly the transition probability one can apply the standard white noise\napproximation in the time interval |t| < C\u03bb/\u03b2 and accept that at |t| > C\u03bb/\u03b2 no transitions\ndue to the noise happen. The parameter C is a constant of the order of unity. Then we\nautomatically get the result \u03c1(\u221e) = exp(\u22122C\u03bb\u03b3/\u03b2)\u03c1(\u2212\u221e). According to the definition,\n\u03b3 \u2248 F (0)/\u03bb in agreement with the calculations of the previous sections. Summarizing, the\ntransitions mediated by the fast noise proceed during the large time interval of the order\nof \u03bb/\u03b2. This is the reason why its total effect remains finite, though it is very small on a\ntypical time scale of the usual LZ-transitions mediated by constant field (\u03c4 \u223c \u0393/\u03b2)50 .\nV.\n\nLANDAU-ZENER TRANSITIONS IN A CONSTANT TRANSVERSE FIELD\n\nAND IN THE COLORED NOISE.\n\nIn previous sections we assumed that only the noise was responsible for transitions,\nwhereas the regular part of the Hamiltonian operator was diagonal. In this section we\nincorporate a regular non-diagonal operator (the transverse field) into the Hamiltonian together with a noise. The most general Hamiltonian for such a two-level system reads:\nH = \u03b2t\u03c3z + g\u03c3x +\n\nX\ni\n\n11\n\n\u03b7i (t)\u03c3i , i = x, y, z\n\n(37)\n\n\fFIG. 1: Typical evolution of the probability P (t) = |a1 (t)|2 , where a1 (t) is the amplitude of the\n\u2032\n\nfirst diabatic state. The choice of parameters is as follows, gij = \u03b4ij J 2 e\u2212\u03bb|t\u2212t | , \u03b2 = 1, \u03bb = 80,\nJ 2 = 0.18, \u0393 = 0.7.\n\nwhere \u03b7i are coordinates of the vectorial Gaussian noise with correlators given by (3).\nThe second term in the Hamiltonian (37) can be considered as a constant transverse\nmagnetic field acting on a spin S = 1/2. The Hamiltonian (37) describes a spin (q-bit)\nweakly interacting with the environment, for example with the nuclear spin bath26 . If this\ninteraction is so small that the bath relaxation is much faster than the inverse interaction\nenergy, the bath can be treated as a fast noisy magnetic field. The measurements of the\nLZ transition probabilities can provide an information about the strength of the coupling to\nthe bath. Another possible example is a molecular nanomagnet in fluctuating dipole field.\nThe Hamiltonian (37) may be relevant to the quantum shuttle problem where avoided level\ncrossings occurred to be important51 . The fast noise in this example corresponds to thermal\nfluctuations.\n12\n\n\fAs it was discussed in the previous section, in the interval of time |\u03b2t| << \u03bb the spin\nexperiences an equivalent white noise with the amplitude \u03b3 = F (0)/(2\u03bb) vanishing at \u03bb \u2192\n\u221e. The noise causes a slow decay of the population difference \u03c1 = \u03c111 \u2212 \u03c122 . The action\nof the noise becomes noticeable only after long evolution time of the order |\u03bb/\u03b2|. On the\ncontrary, the transitions due to the constant transverse field proceed predominantly during\na much shorter interval of time |t| < |g/\u03b2|. During this interval of time the role of noise is\nnegligible comparing with the role of the constant transverse field. Let us choose t0 much\nless than |\u03bb/\u03b2|, but much larger than g/\u03b2 to make sure that the transverse magnetic field is\nneglegible beyond the interval of time (\u2212t0 , t0 ). The evolution from \u2212\u221e to \u2212t0 is influenced\nmainly by the noise. The result of such an evolution is almost the same as that in the absence\nof the constant transverse field with t0 = 0. Since the effective attenuation coefficient for \u03c1\nis an even function of time (see equation (7)), the resulting exponent for \u03c1(t0 ) is twice less\nthan that for the problem of the section (2) at t = +\u221e (equations (9,10):\n\u03c1(\u2212t0 ) = e\u2212\u03c0F (0)/\u03b2\n\n(38)\n\nIn the interval of time |t| < t0 the noise is neglegible and transitions are completely\ndue to the genuine Landau-Zener mechanism, i.e. due to the constant transverse field g.\nSince t0 \u226b g/\u03b2, we can use the LZ formula to determine \u03c1(t0 ). Let a1 (t) and a2 (t) be\nthe amplitudes to find the system at the first and the second diabatic states, respectively,\n(to find the spin projection equals 1/2 or \u22121/2) at the moment of time t. Their values at\n\nt = \u2212t0 can be expressed in terms of the population difference \u03c1\u2217 and two phase factors as\nfollows:\nq\n\na1 (\u2212t0 ) = ei\u03c61 (1 + \u03c1\u2217 )/2\n\n(39)\n\nq\n\na2 (\u2212t0 ) = ei\u03c62 (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2217 )/2\n\nThe phase diference \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 is essentially random and independent on \u03c1\u2217 since, the solution\nof the Shr\u00f6dinger equation strongly oscillates at t < \u2212t0 and transitions are presumably due\nto the non-diagonal noise. The amplitudes at time t0 are related to those at t = \u2212t0 by a\nlinear relation ai (t0 ) = Sij (t0 , \u2212t0 )aj (\u2212t0 ), where S is the transition matrix in the noiseless\nLZ Hamiltonian from t = \u2212t0 to t = t0 . Using this property and averaging over the random\n\nphases \u03c61 and \u03c62 and over \u03c1\u2217 with < \u03c1\u2217 >= \u03c1(\u2212t0 ), we arrive at a following result:\n\u03c1(t0 ) =< |a1 (t0 )|2 \u2212 |a2 (t0 )|2 >= e\u2212\u03c0F (0)/\u03b2 (2e\u2212\u03c0|g|\n13\n\n2 /\u03b2\n\n\u2212 1)\n\n(40)\n\n\f1\n\n0.8\n\nP\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\ng\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFIG. 2: The probability to stay on the same diabatic state in a two level system at constant\ncoupling to the noise as function of transverse magnetic field.

To\ncheck how it works at large but finite \u03bb we studied the LZ transitions subject to a fast noise\nnumerically.\nWe simulated the evolution generated by the Hamiltonian (37). For simplification we put\n\u03b7y = \u03b7z = 0 and accept the following form for the correlator of the noise x-component:\nh\u03b7x (t)\u03b7x (t\u2032 ) = Jx2 exp(\u2212\u03bb|t \u2212 t\u2032 |).

In F ig.2 we depict the probability to stay in the same state after the\nlevel crossing vs. the constant transverse field g at a fixed coupling to the noise Jx = 0.28.\nEach discrete point represents the averaging over 100 simulations with the same coupling\nconstants. The solid line is the graph of the theoretical formula (42). The deviations of\nthe simulation results from the analytical predictions do not exceed the accuracy of our\ncalculations. We conclude that equation (42) describes well the transition probability for\nthe LZ system subject to a fast noise.\n\nVI.\n\nARBITRARY SPIN IN A STRONG DIAGONAL RANDOM FIELD\n\nWe have demonstrated that the non-diagonal \u03b4-like white noise leads to the equilibration\nof population between all states. It is not correct for the white noise directed along the\nsweeping field. Such a noise does not couple different states and its action leads to the loss\nof coherence only. As it was shown earlier, in the case of a 2-level system it results in a\nDebye-Waller factor for \u03c1. We consider the case of a general spin S placed into a regular\nfield h0 = \u1e91\u03b2t + x\u0302\u0393 and the random field directed along z-axis. Its Hamiltonian reads:\nHtot = H + Hnoise = \u03b2tSz + \u0393Sx + \u03b7(t)Sz\n\n(43)\n\nWe assume < \u03b7(t)\u03b7(t\u2032 ) >= 2\u03b3\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\n\nFollowing38 , we expand the solution of equation (43) in the power series over the noise\n\namplitude and average each term. The resulting series over powers of \u03b3 is a formal solution\nof a differential equation known as master equation:38\n\u2202\u03c1(t)\n= \u2212i[H(t), \u03c1(t)] \u2212 \u03b3[Sz , [Sz , \u03c1(t)]] =\n\u2202t\n\u2212i[vtSz + \u0393Sx , \u03c1(t)] \u2212 \u03b3(Sz2 \u03c1(t) + \u03c1(t)Sz2 \u2212 2Sz \u03c1Sz )\n\n(44)\n\nIt is convenient to introduce notations \u0393ij = \u0393 < i|Sx |j >. Below we write down equation\n(44) for diagonal and non-diagonal elements of the density matrix separately:\n\u03c1\u0307ii = \u2212i(\u0393i,i\u22121 (\u03c1i\u22121,i \u2212 \u03c1i,i\u22121 ) + \u0393i,i+1 (\u03c1i+1,i \u2212 \u03c1i,i+1 ))\ni = \u2212S, \u2212S + 1, . . . , S\n\u03c1\u0307mn = \u2212(i\u03b2t(m \u2212 n) + \u03b3(n \u2212 m)2 )\u03c1mn \u2212\n\u2212i(\u0393m,m\u22121 \u03c1m\u22121,n \u2212 \u03c1m,n+1 \u0393n+1,n + \u0393m,m+1 \u03c1m+1,n \u2212 \u03c1m,n\u22121 \u0393n\u22121,n ), m 6= n\n15\n\n(45)\n\n(46)\n\n\fIt is possible to find an asymptotically exact solution of equations (45), (46) in the limit of\nstrong noise \u03b3 \u226b \u0393, \u03b2. In this limiting case, non-diagonal elements of the density matrix are\n\u223c \u0393/\u03b3 times smaller than diagonal ones. Indeed, let us disregard the dynamical term \u03c1\u0307ij\nin equations for the non-diagonal elements. We will justify this approximation later. Then\nequation (46) at n = m \u00b1 1 implies that the non-diagonal elements \u03c1n,n\u00b11 are suppressed\ncomparing with diagonal matrix element by the factor \u223c \u0393/\u03b3. The matrix elements \u03c1n,n\u00b12\nare suppressed by the same factor with respect to \u03c1n,n\u00b11 etc. The characteristic time interval\nfollowing from equation (45)is \u2206t \u223c |\u03c1nn /(\u0393\u03c1n,n\u00b11 ) \u223c \u03b3/\u03932 . From this estimate we find that\nthe time derivative of the largest non-diagonal matrix element |\u03c1\u0307i,i\u00b11 | \u223c (\u03932 /\u03b3)|\u03c1i,i\u00b11 | \u226a\n\u03b3\u03c1i,i\u00b11 can be neglected. Retaining only main diagonal and two adjacent non-diagonals in\nthe matrix equations (45),(46), we express the non-diagonal elements in terms of diagonal:\ni\u0393\n\ni+1,i\n\u03c1i+1,i = \u2212 i\u03b2t+\u03b3\n(\u03c1i,i \u2212 \u03c1i+1,i+1 ),\n\n\u03c1i,i+1 =\n\ni\u0393i,i+1\n(\u03c1i+1,i+1\ni\u03b2t\u2212\u03b3\n\n\u2212 \u03c1i,i ),\n\n(47)\n\n\u03c1i,j = 0, |i \u2212 j| > 1\nThe problem is reduced to determining of the 2S + 1 diagonal elements. Let introduce a\nvector c with the coordinates ci = \u03c1ii . They are probabilities to find the spin in a particular\neigenstate of the operator Sz .

Below we\n16\n\n\fpresent explicitly the transition probabilities for some values of spin.

Physically the model describes the transport of a charged\nparticle in a regular linear chain driven by a time-dependent homogeneous external field.\nSuch a model is an idealization of atomic scale molecular wires or linear arrays of quantum\ndots. An important assumption in the model that makes it exactly solvable is that all sites\nof the chain are identical and equidistant. External electric field splits the energy levels at\ndifferent sites of the chain and suppresses the tunnelling between them. Hence the transitions\n17\n\n\fFIG. 3: .\nTransition probabilities from the state with sz = 3/2 to any other state as functions of transverse\nmagnetic field.\n\nproceed in a narrow time intervals close to moments at which the electric field becomes zero.\nThe noise in such a system arises due to thermal fluctuations chaotically changing the energy\nof the electron. We suppose that there are no correlations of noise at different sites.\nLet us denote |ni a state located at the n-th site of the chain. We assume that these\nstates form a complete orthonormal set (Wannier basis). In terms of this set the electron\nHamiltonian with linear dependence of an external field on time reads:\n\n\u0124 =\n\nX\nn\n\n(g | nihn + 1 | +c.c.) + nvt | nihn | +\u03b7n (t) | nihn |\n18\n\n(55)\n\n\fFIG. 4: Transition probabilities from the state with sz = 1/2 to any other state as functions of\ntransverse magnetic field.\n\nwhere v and g are constants and we assume that the noise power is the same for all sites\ni.e. < \u03b7m \u03b7n >= 2\u03b3\u03b4mn . The derivation of the master equation for this case is similar to\nthat of the previous section. We consider only the limit of strong noise \u03b3 >> g. Then, as in\nprevious example, the non-diagonal elements of the density matrix \u03c1i,j with |i \u2212 j| > 1 can\nbe neglected.

It can be treated as initial conditions for the master equation:\n\u03c10,0 (t = \u2212\u221e) = 1 and all other elements of the density matrix are zeros at t = \u2212\u221e. Then\ndiagonal matrix elements \u03c1n,n acquire the meaning of transition probabilities from zeroth to\nthe n-th site at a current time t. As in the previous example we can find the solution for a\nchain of arbitrary number of sites in the matrix form.\nIn the limit of infinite number of sites a compact solution can be found by employing the\nFourier-transformation \u03c1n,n =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nR 2\u03c0\n0\n\nein\u03c6 u(\u03c6, t).

The difference in the behavior is clearly pronounced. In the absence of the noise the transition\nprobabilities oscillate as functions of n and g (see26 for details). These oscillations arise\ndue to the interference among the amplitudes of different Feynman paths leading from the\ninitial to the final point. In the case of a strong noise these oscillation are suppressed by\nthe noise imposed decoherence and the probability distribution is a smooth bell-like curve.\n\n21\n\n\fA simple parameter that is related to the effective diffusion coefficient and can be measured\nexperimentally is the average square displacement of the particle during one sweep of the\nexternal field.

Depending on the strength of parameters it interpolates between\nthe Landau-Zener formula for noiseless system and the Kayanuma's result for transitions\nmediated by the transverse noise only. We have determined the time intervals during which\ntransitions are substantial and showed that time of transitions mediated by the constant\nfield is much shorter than the time necessary for transition caused by the fast noise. Our\nnumerical simulations are in a good agreement with the analytical formulas . We have\ndiscovered an important property of the non-adiabatic tunnelling process: its probability\ndepends not on the \"power\" of the noise\n\nR\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ng(t)dt but rather on the coupling to the noise\n\ng(0). The former usually is responsible for the decoherence rate in systems without timedependent fields. Measurements of the LZ transition probability can provide the information\nabout the value of this coupling. The multi-level systems placed in regular time-dependent\nfields feel subtle differences of the noise statistical properties.\nWe assumed that the diagonal noise does not dominate. In this situation it does not\nplay any role. However, if the component of the diagonal noise is much stronger than nondiagonal ones, the situation may change drastically. The problem of strong transverse field\ncompatible with noise inverse correlation time also remains open.\nWe have extended the formulas and methods employed for two-level systems to a couple\nof multi-state LZ systems: an arbitrary spin experiencing the time-dependent regular and\nrandom magnetic field and a linear chain of sites in the external time-dependent homogeneous electric field plus noise. The Landau-Zener transitions for spins higher than 1/2\n22\n\n\fwere observed in a number of systems47,48,49 . Therefore we believe that our solutions can be\nchecked experimentally.\n\nIX.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF under the grant DMR0072115 and DMR 0103455, by\nthe TITF of Texas A&M University and by the DOE under the grant DE-FG03-96ER45598.\nWe are grateful to M.
