INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the greatest challenges of the general theory of relativity has been the construction of solutions to the EinsteinMaxwell field equations representing the gravitational field\nof compact stars such as neutron stars (NSs). Stationary axially symmetric spacetimes satisfy basic properties one expects for rotating objects, namely time symmetry and reflection symmetry with respect to the rotation axis (see e.g.\nPach\u00f3n and Sanabria-G\u00f3mez 2006). The simplest stationary\naxially symmetric exact exterior vacuum solution describing\na rotating configuration is the well-known Kerr metric (Kerr\n1963). The Kerr metric is fully described by two free parameters: the mass M and the angular momentum J of the\nobject. However, it is known from numerical models that\nthe quadrupole moment of rotating NSs deviates considerably\nfrom the one given by the Kerr solution QKerr = \u2212J 2 /(Mc2 )\n(see e.g. Laarakkers and Poisson 1999, for details).\nIn the mean time, a considerable number of analytic exterior solutions with a more complex multipolar structure\nthan the one of the Kerr solution have been developed (see\ne.g. Manko et al. 1995, 2000; Stephani et al. 2003). Whether\nanalytic exterior solutions are accurate or not to describe\nthe gravitational field of compact stars is an interesting and\n1\n\nleonardo.pachon@fisica.udea.edu.co\njorge.rueda@icra.it\n3 cesar.valenzuela@correounivalle.edu.co\n2\n\nvery active topic of research (see e.g. Stute and Camenzind\n2002; Berti and Stergioulas 2004; Pach\u00f3n et al. 2006, and references therein).\nThe accuracy of analytic solutions to describe the exterior\ngeometry of a realistic rotating compact star has been tested\nby comparing physical properties, e.g. the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) on the equatorial plane and\nthe gravitational redshift (see Sibgatullin and Sunyaev 1998;\nBerti and Stergioulas 2004; Pach\u00f3n et al. 2006, for details).\nIn order to do such a comparison, the free parameters (i.e. the\nlowest multipole moments) of the analytic exterior spacetime,\nare fixed to the corresponding lowest multipole moments\ngiven by numerical interior solutions of the Einstein equations, for NS realistic models (see e.g. Berti and Stergioulas\n2004).\nFollowing such a procedure, the solution of Manko et al.\n(2000) has been compared by Stute and Camenzind (2002)\nand by Berti and Stergioulas (2004) with the numerical\nsolutions for NSs calculated by Cook et al. (1994) and\nwith those derived by Berti and Stergioulas (2004), respectively. However, being a generalization of the solution of\nTomimatsu and Sato (1972), it cannot describe slowly rotating compact stars (see e.g. Berti and Stergioulas 2004),\nbut the dynamics of astrophysical objects with anisotropic\nstresses (see Dubeibe et al. 2007, for details).\nFollowing a similar procedure, based on tests of the ISCOs\nradii on the equatorial plane of the rotating neutron stars ob-\n\n\f2\n\nPach\u00f3n et al.\n\ntained by Berti and Stergioulas (2004), it has been shown that\nthe six-parametric solution of Pach\u00f3n et al. (2006) (hereafter\nPRS solution, see Sec. 2 for details) is more accurate than the\nmodel of Manko et al. (2000). In addition, being a generalization of the Kerr solution, this solution can be used for arbitrary\nrotation rates.\nBesides the ISCOs radii, there are additional physical properties that can be computed with analytic and numerical models and thus useful to compare and contrast the accuracy of\nanalytic exact models. The aim of this article is to analyze\nthe properties of orbital frequencies of neutral test particles in\nthe PRS and in the Kerr geometries with especial focus on the\nKeplerian \u03bdK , frame-dragging (Lense-Thirring) \u03bdLT , as well as\nthe precession(oscillation) frequencies of the radial and vertiP OS\ncal motions, \u03bdP\u03c1 (\u03bdOS\n\u03c1 ) and \u03bdz (\u03bdz ), respectively.\nThe relevance of these frequencies relies on the fact that\nthey are often invoked to explain the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) observed in some relativistic astrophysical systems such as Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs),\nbinary systems harboring either a NS or a black hole\n(BH) accreting matter from a companion star. For instance, within the Relativistic Precession Model (RPM) introduced by Stella and Vietri (1998); Morsink and Stella (1999);\nStella et al. (1999); Stella and Vietri (1999), the kHz QPOs\nare interpreted as a direct manifestation of the modes of relativistic epicyclic motion of blobs arising at various radii r in\nthe inner parts of the accretion disk around the compact object\n(see Sec. 6, for details).\nIn addition to the RPM, the Keplerian, precession and oscillation frequencies are used in other QPO theoretical models (see e.g. Lin et al. 2011, for a recent comparison of the\nexisting models). Due to the influence of general relativistic\neffects in the determination of such frequencies, an observational confirmation of any of the models might lead to an outstanding test of general relativity in the strong field regime.\nIn this line, it is of interest to compare and contrast the orbital frequencies given by the Kerr solution and by the PRS\nsolution (see Sec. 3), which help to establish the differences\nbetween possible BH and NS signatures. We emphasize in\nthis article the major role of the quadrupole moment as well\nas of the octupole moment of the object, whose possible measurement can be used as a tool to test the no-hair theorem of\nBHs (see e.g. Johannsen and Psaltis 2011) and to discriminate\nbetween the different theoretical models proposed to explain\nthe physics at interior and exterior of the Neutron Stars. Additionally, in the case of NSs, the interpretation of QPOs as\nthe manifestation of orbital motion frequencies might lead to\ncrucial information of the NS parameters such as mass, angular momentum (see e.g. Stella and Vietri 1998; T\u00f6r\u00f6k et al.\n2010), and quadrupole moment (see e.g. Morsink and Stella\n1999). These parameters reveal, at the same time, invaluable\ninformation about the EoS of nuclear matter.\nThe article is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we recall the\nproperties of the PRS solution. The computation of the orbital frequencies as well as the comparison of their features\nin the Kerr and in the PRS spacetimes, is shown in Sec. 3. In\nSec. 4 we study the accuracy of the analytic formulas of the\nperiastron and nodal frequencies derived by Ryan (1995) for\nstationary axially symmetric spacetimes. In Sections 5 and\n6 we discuss the accuracy of the PRS solution in describing\nthe frequencies of realistic NS models and its relevance in the\nRelativistic Precession Model, respectively. The conclusions\nof this work and a discussion on possible additional effects to\n\nbe accounted for in the determination of the orbital frequencies, e.g. the effect of magnetic dipole moment, are outlined\nin Sec. 7.\n2. THE PRS ANALYTIC EXACT SOLUTION\n\nWe first recall the PRS analytic model (Pach\u00f3n et al. 2006),\nfor the exterior gravitational field of a compact object4 .

(1995), in the particular case N = 3. In\naddition, the functional form of the metric functions resembles the one derived previously by Bret\u00f3n et al. (1999). Besides the limiting cases discussed in Pach\u00f3n et al. (2006) it is\nworth mentioning that, in the vacuum case q = 0 and \u03bc = 0,\nfor s = 0 this solution reduces to the solution of Manko et al.\n(1995) under the same physical conditions, namely q = 0,\nc = 0 and b = 0 in Manko et al. (1995).\n3. ORBITAL MOTION FREQUENCIES ON THE EQUATORIAL PLANE\n\nAlthough for the case of compact stars contributions from\nthe magnetic field could be relevant (see e.g. Bakala et al.\n2010; Sanabria-G\u00f3mez et al. 2010; Bakala et al. 2012), we focus in this work on the frequencies of neutral particles orbiting a neutral compact object. We calculate here the Keplerian \u03bdK = \u03a9K /(2\u03c0), frame-dragging (Lense-Thirring) \u03bdLT =\n\nE 2 g\u03c6\u03c6 + 2ELgt\u03c6 + L2 gtt\ng2t\u03c6 \u2212 gtt g\u03c6\u03c6\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere, for circular orbits, the energy E and angular momentum L are determined by the conditions V = 0 and dV/d\u03c1 = 0\n(see Eqs. 22\u201323). The frequencies at the ISCO's location (determined by the additional condition d2 V/d\u03c12 = 0) are of particular interest. Thus, before starting the discussion of the\nfrequencies, it is important to explore the ISCO parametric\ndependence. We report here, as \u221a\nstandard in the literature, the\nphysical ISCO radius given by g\u03c6\u03c6 evaluated at the root of\nEq. (19) that gives the coordinate ISCO radius. In the upper\npanel of Fig. 1 we plotted contours of constant ISCO radii as\na function of the dimensionless angular momentum parameter j = J/M02 and the star quadrupole moment M2 , for the\nPRS solution. The use of the dimensionless parameter j in\nthe horizontal axis allows to, qualitatively, relate deviations\nof the contour lines from vertical lines to the influence of\nthe quadrupole moment. We can see that the ISCO radius\ndecreases for increasing j and decreasing M2 . A quantitative\nmeasurement of this influence could be derived from the effective slope of the contour lines. We are interested in the comparison with the Kerr geometry, so in the lower panel, we plotted contours of constant ratio rISCO,PRS /rISCO,Kerr as a function\nof j and the difference between the quadrupole moment of the\nPRS solution M2,PRS and the Kerr quadrupole M2,Kerr = \u2212ma2 ,\ni.e. M2,PRS \u2212 M2,Kerr = M2,PRS + ma2 = mk, see Eq. (11). Deviations from the Kerr geometry are evident. Negative values of\nthe angular momentum correspond to the radii of the counterrotating orbits obtained here through the change gt\u03c6 \u2192 \u2212gt\u03c6\n(see discussion below).\nWe stress that the accuracy of the PRS solution for describing the ISCO radius of realistic NSs was already shown to be\nhigher with respect to other analytic models (see Pach\u00f3n et al.\n2006, for details). In Table 1 we compare the ISCO radius\nfor two rapidly rotating NS, models 20 and 26, of Table VI of\nPappas and Apostolatos (2012) for the EoS L. The lowest multipole moments of the analytic models are fixed to the numerical values obtained by Pappas and Apostolatos (2012). In the\ncase of the Kerr solution, only M0 and J can be fixed, while\nM2 , and S 3 have values that depend on M0 and J and therefore cannot be fixed. For the PRS solution with s = 0, M0 , J\nand M2 can be fixed while S 3 remains induced by the lower\nmoments. We present also the ISCO radius obtained by fixing\nM0 , J, M2 , as well as S 3 in the PRS analytic exact model.\nIn Figs. 1\u20136, we have fixed as an example M0 = m =\n1.88M\u2299 = 2.78 km, and s = 0. We recall that the quadrupole\nmoment in the geometric units used here (km3 ) is related\ngeo\nto the one in CGS units by M2CGS = (1015c2 /G)M2 =\ngeo\n1.35 \u00d7 1043 (M2 /km3 ) g cm2 , and the mass of the Sun is\ngeo\nM\u2299 = 1.477 km. The dimensionless angular momentum j is\nobtained from the CGS values of J and M0 as j = cJ/(GM02 ).\nIt is appropriate to compare the range of values of j = J/M02\nand M2 used in Figs. 1\u20136 with typical values of a NS. For\nthe used mass M0 = 1.88M\u2299, Morsink and Stella (1999) ob-\n\n\f4\n\nPach\u00f3n et al.\n\n0\n\n10\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nM2,PRS @km3D\n\n-5\n\n11\n18\n\n-10\n\n-15\n17\n\n19\n\n15\n\n-20\n-0.4\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\n13\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nj\n5\n0.95\n\nM2,PRS -M2,Kerr@km3D\n\n0 1\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n1.05\n\nRN [km]\n19.81\n19.87\n\nRSS [km]\n13.39\n17.16\n\nRKerr [km]\n16.14\n15.94\n\nRPRS,s=0 [km]\n19.28\n19.65\n\nRPRS [km]\n18.99\n19.54\n\nTABLE 1\nComparison of the ISCO radius for the selected NS models 20 and 26 of\nTable VI of Pappas and Apostolatos (2012) for the EoS L.

Based\non this fact, it is clear that not all the values of the (M2 , j)\npairs of quadrupole and angular momentum depicted in, e.g.,\nFig. 1 are physically meaningful. The maximum rotation\nrate of a neutron star taking into account both the effects\nof general relativity and deformations has been found to be\n\u03bds,max = 1045(M0/M\u2299 )1/2 (10 km/R)3/2 Hz, largely independent on the EoS (see Lattimer and Prakash 2004, for details).\nCorresponding to this maximum rotation rate, the angular momentum is Jmax = 2\u03c0\u03bds,max I \u223c 6.56 \u00d7 1048 I45 g cm2 s\u22121 ,\nand jmax = GJmax /(cM02 ) \u223c 0.74I45 /(M0 /M\u2299 )2 , where I45\nis the moment of inertia of the NS in units of 1045 g cm2 .\nThe fastest observed pulsar is PSR J1748-2246ad with a rotation frequency of 716 Hz (Hessels et al. 2006), which constrains the mass of the NS to M0 \u2265 0.47(R/10 km)3 M\u2299 , and\nj \u223c 0.51I45/(M0 /M\u2299 )2 , which becomes j \u223c 0.26I45 for a\ncanonical NS of M0 = 1.4M\u2299 .\n3.1.

For\na fixed mass the quadrupole moment is an increasing func-\n\nNow we turn into the frequencies analysis. For stationary\naxially symmetric spacetimes, the frequency of Keplerian orbits is given by (see e.g. Ryan 1995)\nq\n\u2212gt\u03c6,\u03c1 \u00b1 g2t\u03c6,\u03c1 \u2212 g\u03c6\u03c6,\u03c1 gtt,\u03c1\n,\n(20)\n\u03a9K =\ng\u03c6\u03c6,\u03c1\nwhere a colon stands for partial derivative with respect to the\nindicated coordinate and '+' and '-' stands for corotating and\ncounter-rotating orbits, respectively.\nFor the case of static\n\u221a spacetimes, i.e. for \u03c9 = 0 and therefore gt\u03c6 = 0, \u03a9K = \u00b1 \u2212g\u03c6\u03c6,\u03c1gtt,\u03c1 /g\u03c6\u03c6,\u03c1 and the energy E and\nangular momentum L per mass \u03bc of the test particle can be\nexpressed in terms of the metric tensor components (see e.g.\nRyan 1995),\nE\n\u2212gtt\n= q\n,\n\u03bc\n\u2212gtt \u2212 g\u03c6\u03c6 \u03a92K\n\ng\u03c6\u03c6 \u03a9K\nL\n= q\n.\n\u03bc\n\u2212gtt \u2212 g\u03c6\u03c6 \u03a92K\n\n(21)\n\nFrom here, it is clear that taking the negative branch of the\nroot for \u03a9K in Eq. (20) is equivalent to studying a particle\nwith opposite angular momentum, i.e. Lcount\u2212rot = \u2212Lco\u2212rot .\nThus, in the static case the magnitude of the energy and angular momentum are invariant under the change \u03a9K \u2192 \u2212\u03a9K .\nNow we consider the case of stationary space times, \u03c9 , 0.\nThe energy E and angular momentum L per mass \u03bc are, in this\n\n\f5\ncase, given by (see e.g. Ryan 1995)\n\n\u2212gtt \u2212 2gt\u03c6 \u03a9K \u2212\n\n,\n\n1.2\n\n(22)\n\n1.6\n\ng\u03c6\u03c6 \u03a92K\n\ngt\u03c6 + g\u03c6\u03c6 \u03a9K\n\n0.9\n.\n\n-5\n\n(23)\n\n\u2212gtt \u2212 2gt\u03c6 \u03a9K \u2212 g\u03c6\u03c6 \u03a92K\n\nThe counter-rotating condition expressed by the negative\nbranch of Eq. (20), can be generated by the change gt\u03c6 \u2192\n\u2212gt\u03c6 , which seems to be a more physical and transparent condition. In contrast to the static case, the counter-rotating orbit has now different energy and different magnitude of the\nangular momentum due the presence of the dragging of inertial frames, characterized by the metric component gt\u03c6 (cf.\nEq. (26) below). In a nutshell, the dynamics of counterrotating orbits of a test-particle can be derived, starting from\nthe positive branch of Eq. (20), by considering a spacetime\nwith gt\u03c6 \u2192 \u2212gt\u03c6 .\nFor the vacuum case, a similar analysis as the one developed by Herrera et al. (2006), clearly shows that the change in\nthe global sign of gt\u03c6 is achieved by changing not only the\nangular momentum of the star, J \u2192 \u2212J, but all the rotational multipolar moments. For the Kerr metric this change\nis obtained by changing the sign of the parameter a (see Appendix B) while in the PRS solution we need additionally\nchange the sign of the parameter s associated to differential\nrotation, i.e., by changing a \u2192 \u2212a and s \u2192 \u2212s5 .\nOnce we have clarified this important issue about the corotating and counter-rotating orbits, we proceed to analyze\nthe functional dependence of the Keplerian frequency on the\nmultipole moments. In the upper panel of Fig. 2 we plotted\ncontours of constant Keplerian frequency for the PRS solution, \u03bdK,PRS = \u03a9K,PRS /(2\u03c0), as a function of the dimensionless\nangular momentum parameter j and the quadrupole moment\nM2,PRS , at the ISCO radius. It can be seen that the influence of\nthe quadrupole moment is non-negligible, as evidenced from\nthe departure of the contour lines from vertical lines. The Keplerian frequency grows for increasing J and M2 . In the lower\npanel, we plotted contours of constant ratio \u03bdK,PRS /\u03bdK,Kerr as a\nfunction of j and the difference between the quadrupole moment of the PRS solution, M2,PRS , and the Kerr quadrupole,\nM2,Kerr .\nIt is appropriate to recall here that because the Keplerian\nas well as the other frequencies calculated below are evaluated using formulas in the coordinate frame, see for instance\nEq. (20), they must be evaluated\n\u221a at coordinate radii \u03c1 and\nnot at physical radii given by g\u03c6\u03c6 . In the specific case of\nthe ISCO the frequencies are evaluated at the radius that simultaneously solves the equations V = 0, dV/d\u03c1 = 0, and\nd2 V/d\u03c12 = 0, where V is the effective potential (19).\n3.2.

(20).\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 3, we plotted contours of constant nodal precession frequency \u03bdPz at the ISCO radius as\na function of j = J/M02 and M2 for the PRS solution, at\nthe ISCO radius. We can see now that the influence of the\nquadrupole moment is quite important. The nodal precession\nfrequency increases for increasing J and decreasing M2 , at\nfixed M0 . In the lower panel we plotted contours of constant\nratio \u03bdPz,PRS /\u03bdPz,Kerr , at the ISCO radius, as a function of j and\nthe difference M2,PRS \u2212 M2,Kerr , in order to evidentiate deviations from the Kerr solution. The radial oscillation frequency\n\u03bdOS\n\u03c1 vanishes at the ISCO radius and therefore at such location the radial precession frequency equals the Keplerian frequency, whose contours have been plotted in Fig. 2.\nIn Figs. 4 and 5 we plotted the nodal precession frequency\n\u03bdPz and the radial oscillation frequency \u03bdOS\n\u03c1 as a function of\nthe Keplerian frequency \u03bdK , respectively, for both the Kerr\nand PRS solutions. As an example, we have shown the\nresults for rotating NS models 20 and 26 of Table VI of\nPappas and Apostolatos (2012), for the EoS L. The lowest\nmultipole moments of the PRS solution M0 , J, M2 , and\nS 3 have been fixed to the numerical values obtained by\nPappas and Apostolatos (2012). In the case of the Kerr solution, only M0 and J can be fixed, while M2 , and S 3 have\nvalues induced by the lower moments M0 and J. For the PRS\nsolution with s = 0, M0 , J and M2 can be fixed while S 3 cannot be fixed and depends on the lower moments. The results\nfor the PRS analytic model obtained by fixing M0 , J, M2 , as\nwell as S 3 are also shown.\nThe deviations of the quadrupole and current octupole moments given by the Kerr solution from the numerical values\nof Pappas and Apostolatos (2012) can be used to show the\nlow accuracy of the Kerr solution to describe fast rotating NSs.\nThe accuracy of the PRS solution in describing the ISCO radii\nof these two models has been shown in Table 1 of Section 3.\nIn Figs. 4 and 5 we can see the differences of the \u03bdPz \u2013\u03bdK\nand \u03bdOS\n\u03c1 \u2013\u03bdK relations between the Kerr and PRS solutions for\nrealistic NS models. The deviations of the Kerr solution, especially at fast rotation rates, are evident because of the influence of the deformation (quadrupole M2 ) of the star as well\nas, although in less proportion, of the octupole current S 3 . In\ngeneral, we observe that the larger the angular momentum, the\npoorer the performance of the predictions of Kerr solution.\nWe have also shown in Figs. 4\u20135 the influence of the current\noctupole S 3 in the determination of the precession and oscillation frequencies. We found that the effect of S 3 is only appreciable for the fastest models. The minor influence, in this\ncase, of the current octupole S 3 is expected from the small\nvalues of the parameter s needed to fit the numerical values of\nPappas and Apostolatos (2012). Clearly, larger values of the\nparameter s needed to fit realistic values of S 3 will enhance\nas well deviations from the Kerr spacetime.\nThe effects of a multipolar structure that deviates from\nthe one of the Kerr geometry on the various quantities\nanalyzed here are relevant for instance in the RPM of\nthe QPOs observed in LMXBs (see e.g. Stella and Vietri\n(1998); Morsink and Stella (1999); Stella et al.

Dragging of Inertial Frames\n\nIt is known that a prediction of general relativity is that a rotating object makes a zero angular momentum test particle to\norbit around it, namely it drags the particle into the direction\nof its rotation angular velocity; such an effect is called dragging of inertial frames or Lense-Thirring effect. Consequently,\noblique particle orbit planes with respect to the source equatorial plane will precess around the rotation axis of the object.\nIn stationary axially symmetric spacetimes described by the\n\n\f7\n\n400\n\nKerr\nPRSs =0\nPRS\n\n\u03bdzP [Hz]\n\n300\n\nKerr\nPRSs =0\nPRS\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0. 0\n0. 0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\u03bdK[kHz]\n\n1. 4\n\n1. 6\n\n1. 8\n\n2.0\n\n2.2\n\nFig. 4.- Nodal precession frequency \u03bdPz versus Keplerian frequency \u03bdK\ngiven by the Kerr and PRS analytic solutions.

The latter experiment measured a frame dragging effect within an accuracy of 19% with\nrespect to the prediction of general relativity.\nThe smallness of this effect around the Earth makes such\n\nmeasurements quite difficult and has represented a multi year\nchallenge for Astronomy. The frame dragging precession increases with the increasing of the angular momentum of the\nrotating object and therefore a major hypothetical arena for\nthe searching of more appreciable Lense-Thirring precession\nis the spacetime around compact objects such as BHs and NSs.\nThe much stronger gravitational field of these objects with respect to the Earth one allow them to attain much faster angular\nrotation rates and so larger angular momentum.\nStella and Vietri (1998) showed how, in the weak field slow\nrotation regime, the vertical precession frequency \u03bdPz (orbital\nplane precession frequency) can be divided into one contribution due to the Lense-Thirring precession and another one due\nto the deformation (non-zero quadrupole moment) of the rotating object, both of them comparable from the quantitative\npoint of view. These frequencies could be in principle related\nto the motion of the matter in the accretion disks around BHs\nand NSs and thus particularly applicable to LMXBs. For fast\nrotating NSs and BHs the frequency at which the orbital plane,\nand so the frame dragging precession frequency, can reach values of the order of tens of Hz (see e.g. Stella and Vietri (1998)\nand Figs. 3 and 4).\nThus, it is clear that an observational confirmation of the\nrelativistic precession of matter around either a NS or a BH\nwill lead to an outstanding test of the general relativity in the\nstrong field regime and, at the same time, an indirect check\nof the large effects of the frame dragging in the exterior spacetime of compact objects (see e.g. Morsink and Stella 1999, for\ndetails).\nAlthough making independent measurements of the frame\ndragging effect around BHs and NSs is a very complicate task,\nit is important to know the numerical values of the precession\nfrequency due to the frame dragging with respect to other relativistic precession effects, e.g. geodetic precession. In addition, it is important to know the sensitivity of the precession\nfrequency to the object parameters such as mass, angular momentum, quadrupole, and octupole moment.\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 6 we plotted contours of constant frame dragging frequency \u03bdLT for the PRS solution, at\nthe ISCO radius, as a function of the the angular momentum\nper unit mass J/M0 and the quadruple moment M2 , for a compact object mass M0 = m = 1.88M\u2299 . Correspondingly, in\nthe lower panel of Fig. 6, we show the differences between\nthe frame dragging precession frequency as predicted by the\nKerr and PRS solutions, at the ISCO radius, as a function\nof j = J/M02 and the difference between the quadrupole moments, M2,PRS \u2212 M2,Kerr .\nThe influence of the quadrupole moment in the determination of the frame dragging frequency is evident; the frequency\n\u03bdLT given by a NS is generally smaller than the one given by a\nBH as can be seen from the value of the ratio \u03bdLT,PRS /\u03bdLT,Kerr <\n1 obtained for configurations with a quadrupole moment that\ndeviates with respect to the one given by the Kerr solution,\nnamely for M2,PRS \u2212 M2,Kerr = M2,PRS + ma2 = mk , 0, see\nEq. (11).\nIt is also worth mentioning that frame dragging precession\ncan be affected as well by the presence of electromagnetic\nfields (Herrera et al. 2006, see) and further research in this\nrespect deserves the due attention.\n4.

For the PRS solution in the vacuum case, M4 =\nm(a4 \u2212 3a2 + k2 + 2as).\nThe above formulas are approximate expressions of the periastron and nodal precession frequencies in the weak field\n(large distances from the source) and slow rotation regimes.\nWe should therefore expect that they become less accurate at\ndistances close to the central object, e.g. at the ISCO radius,\nand for fast rotating objects. However, such formulas are an\nimportant tool to understand the role of the lowest multipole\nmoments on the values of the relativistic precession frequencies, such as the importance of the higher multipole moments\nat short distances and high frequencies as can be seen from\nEqs. (27\u201328).\nAt high frequencies, for instance of the order of kHz, deviations from the above scaling laws are appreciable. In Figs. 7\nand 8 we compare the radial precession and vertical oscillation frequencies, \u03bdP\u03c1 and \u03bdOS\nz , as a function of the Keplerian frequency \u03bdK , as given by the full expressions (24) for the PRS\nsolution and by the approximate formulas (27) and (28), respectively.6 The lowest multipole moments M0 , J, M2 , and S 3\nof the PRS solution have been fixed to the values of two models of the Table VI of Pappas and Apostolatos (2012); Model\n2 with M0 = 2.071 km (1.402M\u2299), j = 0.194, M2 = \u22122.76\nkm3 (3.73 \u00d7 1043 g cm2 ), S 3 = \u22122.28 km4 and Model 20 with\nM0 = 4.167 km (2.82M\u2299), j = J/M02 = 0.70, M2 = \u221279.8\nkm3 (\u22121.08 \u00d7 1045 g cm2 ) and S 3 = \u2212401.0 km4 .\nIn the \u03bdOS\nz \u2013\u03bdK relation, the blue dotted curve depicts the\ncontribution from the angular momentum (we plot the series\n(28) up to V3 ), for the blue dot-dashed curve we added the\nfirst contribution from the quadrupole moment M2 (we cut\nthe series at V4 ), for the dashed blue line we added the first\ncontribution from the octupole mass-current (series expansion\nup to V7 ) and finally in the continuos blue line we consider\n6 Because the scale of the \u03bdP and \u03bdP frequencies are very similar, we de\u03c1\nz\ncided to plot in Fig. 7 \u03bdP\u03c1 and \u03bdOS\nz whose scales are different allowing a more\nclear comparison with the PRS solution in a single figure.\n\n\f9\nOS\n\nOS\n\n\u03bdz,O(\u03bd3 )\n\n[kHz]\n\u03bd\u03b1*\n\n1. 6\n1. 4\n1. 2\n1. 0\n0. 8\n0. 6\n0. 4\n0. 2\n0.00.0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n\u03bdz,O(\u03bd9 )\n\n\u03bdz,O(\u03bd7 )\n\nP\n\u03bd\u03c1,O(\u03bd4 )\n\n0. 6\n\nOS\n\nOS\n\n\u03bdz,O(\u03bd4 )\n\nP\n\u03bd\u03c1,O(\u03bd2 )\n\nP\n\u03bd\u03c1,O(\u03bd10 )\n\nP\n\u03bd\u03c1,O(\u03bd7 )\n\n08\n1. 0\n[kHz]\n\n1. 2\n\n.\n\u03bdK\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nP\nFig. 7.- Comparison of the \u03bdOS\nz \u2013\u03bdK and \u03bd\u03c1 \u2013\u03bdK relations given by the PRS\nsolution and the approximate expressions (27\u201328) derived by Ryan (1995).\nThe lowest multipole moments M0 , J, M2 , and S 3 have been fixed to the\nvalues of the Model 2 of the Table VI of Pappas and Apostolatos (2012):\nM0 = 2.071 km (1.402M\u2299 ), j = 0.194, M2 = \u22122.76 km3 (3.73 \u00d7 1043 g\ncm2 ), and S 3 = \u22122.28 km4 .\n\nOS\n\nOS\n\n\u03bdz,O(\u03bd3 )\n\nOS\n\nOS\n\n\u03bdz,O(\u03bd4 )\n\nP\n\u03bd\u03c1,O(\u03bd2 )\n\n\u03bdz,O(\u03bd9 )\n\n\u03bdz,O(\u03bd7 )\n\nP\n\u03bd\u03c1,O(\u03bd4 )\n\nP\n\u03bd\u03c1,O(\u03bd10 )\n\nP\n\u03bd\u03c1,O(\u03bd7 )\n\n1. 0\n\n5.

We can see from Figs. 7 and\n8 that the Ryan's approximate formulas describe more accurately the Model 2 than the Model 20. The reason is that, as\nwe mentioned above, we should expect a better accuracy of\nthe series expansions from low to moderate moderate rotation\nrates and consequently the same occur for the quadrupole deformations. It is clear that there are appreciable differences\nboth in rotation and deformation between the two selected\nmodels; we recall also that the rotation frequency of the star\ncan be expressed as a function of the dimensionless j parameter as \u03bd s = G jM02 /(2\u03c0cI) = 1.4(M/M\u2299)2/I45 kHz.\nIt is noteworthy that we have checked that the Ryan's series\nexpansions, Eqs. (27) and (28), fit quite accurately the exact\nresults if taken up to order V10 . In particular the values of\nthe vertical oscillation and precession frequencies are fit better\nthan the corresponding radial ones. For the Model 2 the radial\noscillation frequency is well fitted by the Ryan's expression\nup to Keplerian frequencies of order \u223c 1.2 kHz while, for the\nModel 20, the approximate formulas break down at a lower\nvalue \u223c 0.7 kHz. These results are of particular relevance because it makes possible the extraction of the object parameters\n(for instance the lowest multipoles up to S 3 ) by the fitting of\nthe observed QPO frequencies in LMXBs, providing they are\nindeed related to the precession and oscillation frequencies of\nmatter in the accretion disk (see Section 6, for details) and for\nKeplerian motion not exceeding a few kHz of frequency.\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0.6\n[kHz]\n\n\u03bdK\n\n0. 8\n\n1. 0\n\n1.2\n\nP\nFig. 8.- Comparison of the \u03bdOS\nz \u2013\u03bdK and \u03bd\u03c1 \u2013\u03bdK relations as given by the PRS\nsolution and the approximate expressions (27-28) derived by Ryan (1995).\nThe lowest multipole moments M0 , J, M2 , and S 3 have been fixed to the\nvalues of the Model 20 of the Table VI of Pappas and Apostolatos (2012):\nM0 = 4.167 km (2.82M\u2299 ), j = J/M02 = 0.70, M2 = \u221279.8 km3 (\u22121.08 \u00d7 1045\ng cm2 ) and S 3 = \u2212401.0 km4\n\ncontributions for higher multipole moments and stop the series at the order V9 , not shown in Eqs. (28). For this case, we\ncan see that Ryan's expressions clearly tend, from the bottom,\nto the exact result (continuous black curve) obtained by using\nthe PRS solution.\nFor the analysis of the \u03bdP\u03c1 \u2013\u03bdK relation we followed the same\nprocedure as described above. In this case, the Ryan's expressions tend from the top to the exact result, the continuous\nblack curve, represented by the PRS solution. It is interesting\nto see that the introduction of the octupole moment (dashed\nred line) makes the approximation to deviate from the exact\nresult, however by including more terms the accuracy is enhanced. As can be seen from Figs. 7 and 8 the quantitative\naccuracy of the Ryan's approximate formulas in the periastron precession frequency \u03bdP\u03c1 is less than the one obtained in\nthe vertical oscillation frequency \u03bdOS\nz .\nThe importance of the high-order multipole moments such\nas the quadrupole and the octupole moments is evident in the\nhigh-frequency regime. This is in line with the results shown\n\nWe turn now to analyze the behavior of the Kerr and\nPRS solutions in predicting results for the Keplerian, frame\ndragging, and vertical oscillation frequencies, for realistic\nNSs. In particular, we compare their predictions with the\nfrequencies calculated by Morsink and Stella (1999). Since\nMorsink and Stella (1999) did not include the values of the\noctupole current moment S 3 , here we set s = 0 in Eq. (10)\nfor the PRS solution. For the sake of comparison, we choose\nthe results derived by Morsink and Stella (1999) for the EoS\nL, because for this EoS the highest rotating parameter j and\nquadrupole moment M2 were found. In addition, the stiffness of such an EoS allows the maximum mass of the NS\nto be larger than the highest observed NS mass, M0 = 1.97 \u00b1\n0.04M\u2299, corresponding to the 317 Hz (3.15 milliseconds rotation period) pulsar J1614-2230 (see Demorest et al. 2010, for\ndetails).\nThis regime of high j and M2 in realistic models is particularly interesting to test the deviations of the Kerr solution in\nthe description of NS signatures as well as to explore the accuracy of the PRS solution. In Table 2, we present the results\nfor four different sets of the star spin frequency \u03bd s , namely\n\u03bd s = 290 Hz (M1 and M2), \u03bd s = 360 Hz (M3 and M4),\n\u03bd s = 580 Hz (M5 and M6) and \u03bd s = 720 Hz (M7 and M8).\nIn Table 2, we clearly observe that the results predicted\nby the PRS s=0 solution for the Keplerian and frame-dragging\nfrequencies are in excellent agreement with those calculated\nby Morsink and Stella (1999) for even highly massive, rotating and deformed models such as the model M7 with\nM0 = 2.17M\u2299, j = 0.51 and M2 = \u221239.4Q0 .

The quadrupole moment M2 have been normalized for convenience to the value Q0 = 1043 g cm2 .\n\ntions to be tested for future numerical computations. This fact\ncan be checked within the calculations of Morsink and Stella\n(1999) by exploring the properties of counter-rotating orbits\nwhich produce in general ISCO radii larger than the ones of\nthe corotating ones. In Table 3, we depicted the results in the\ncounter-rotating case where we can notice an improvement\nof the accuracy of the PRS solution with respect to the corotating case.\nIn this line, we consider worth performing numerical computations of the precession and oscillation frequencies of particles around realistic NSs in a wider space of parameters and\nusing up-to-date numerical techniques which will certainly\nhelp to establish and elucidate more clearly the accuracy of\nanalytic models. It is also appropriate recalling the recent results of Pappas and Apostolatos (2012) on the computation of\nthe general relativistic multipole moments in axially symmetric spacetimes.\n6. THE RELATIVISTIC PRECISION MODEL\n\nThe X-ray light curves of LMXBs show a variability from\nwhich a wide variety of QPOs have been measured, expanding from relatively low \u223c Hz frequencies all the way up to\nhigh \u223c kHz frequencies (see e.g. van der Klis 1995, for details). In particular, such frequencies usually come in pairs\n(often called twin peaks), the lower and upper frequencies, \u03bdl\nand \u03bdh respectively. BHs and NSs with similar masses can\nshow similar signatures and therefore the identification of the\ncompact object in a LMXB is not a simple task. If the QPO\nphenomena observed in these systems are indeed due to relativistic motion of accretion disk matter, the knowledge of the\nspecific behavior of the particle frequencies (e.g. rotation, oscillation, precession) in the exterior geometry of NSs and BHs\nbecomes essential as a tool for the identification of the nature\nof the compact object harbored by a LMXB.\nIt is not the scope of this work to test a particular model\nfor the QPO phenomenon in LMXBs but instead to show the\ninfluence of the high multipole moments on the orbital motion of test particles especially the role of the quadrupole moment which is of particular interest to differentiate a NS from a\nBH. There are in the literature several models that describe the\nQPOs in LMXBs through the frequencies of particles around\nthe compact object, and for a recent review and comparison of\nthe different models we refer to the recent work of Lin et al.\n(2011). In order to show here the main features and differences between the Kerr and the PRS solutions we shall use\nthe Relativistic Precession Model (RPM).\nThe RPM model identifies the lower and higher (often\ncalled twin-peaks) kHz QPO frequencies, \u03bdl and \u03bdh , with\nthe periastron precession and Keplerian frequencies, namely\n\u03bdl = \u03bdP\u03c1 and \u03bdh = \u03bdK , respectively. The so-called horizontal branch oscillations (HBOs), which belong to the low frequency QPOs observed in high luminosity Z-sources (see e.g.\n\nvan der Klis 1995, for details), are related within the RPM\nmodel to the nodal precession frequency \u03bdPz of the same orbits\n(Morsink and Stella 1999, see). We will use here in particular\nthe realistic NS models of Morsink and Stella (1999) for the\nEoS L.\nOne of the salient features of the RPM model is that in the\ncase of the HBO frequencies, the relations inferred from the\nfirst term of the expansions (27) and (28)\n\u03bdK = 3\u22123/5 (2\u03c0)\u22122/5m\u22122/5 (\u03bdP\u03c1 )3/5 ,\n\n(29)\n\n\u03bdPz = (2/3)6/5\u03c01/5 j m1/5 (\u03bdP\u03c1 )6/5\n\n(30)\n\n,\n\nwhich implies a nodal precession frequency proportional to\nthe square of the Keplerian frequency has been observed in\nsome sources, for instance in the LMXB 4U 1728\u201334 (see\nFord and van der Klis 1998, for details). In addition, 6/5\npower law relating the nodal and periastron precession frequencies can explain (see Stella et al. 1999) the correlation\nbetween two of the observed QPO frequencies found in the\nfluxes of NSs and BHs LMXBs (see Psaltis et al. 1999, for\ndetails). This fact provides, at the same time, a significant test\nof the Ryan's analytic expressions.\nIt is interesting to analyze the level of predictability of the\nprecession and oscillation frequencies on particular astrophysical sources. In Fig. 9 we show the \u03bdl \u2013\u03bdh relation within the\nRPM model, namely \u03bdP\u03c1 versus \u03bdK for the models M1\u2013M8 of\nTable 2. In the upper panel we show the results for the PRS\nsolution while, in the lower panel, we present the results for\nthe Kerr solution. We have indicated the QPO frequencies observed in the sources GX 5\u20131 (see e.g. Wijnands et al. 1998;\nJonker et al. 2002), 4U 1735\u201344 (see e.g. Ford et al. 1998),\n4U 1636\u201353 (see e.g. Wijnands et al. 1997), Sco X1 (see\ne.g. van der Klis et al. 1996), GX 17\u20132 (see e.g. Homan et al.\n2002), GX 340+0 (see e.g. Jonker et al. 2000), Cir X1 (see e.g.\nvan der Klis et al. 1996), 4U 0614+091 (see e.g. Ford et al.\n1997), and 4U 1728\u201334 (see e.g. Strohmayer et al. 1996).\nBoth the upper and lower panels of Fig. 9 have been plotted using the same frequency scales in order to aid the identification of the differences between the Kerr and the PRS\nsolutions. One can notice that all the solid curves in the\nKerr solution (lower panel of Fig. 9) are outside the range of\nthe observed QPO frequencies exemplified, while all dashed\nand solid curves of the PRS are inside the QPO range. It\nis then clear that making a fit of the observed QPO frequencies of the selected LMXBs of Fig. 9 will necessarily require\na different choice of parameters in the Kerr and PRS solutions. Therefore, conclusions for instance on the NS parameters (e.g. mass, angular momentum, quadrupole deformation)\nbased on fitting QPOs using the Kerr geometry will deviate\nfrom the actual parameters (see e.g. Laarakkers and Poisson\n1999, for details), extractable more reliably from a more complex geometry, such as the PRS one, that allows a better es-\n\n\f11\nr\u2212MS [km]\n18.8\n25.9\n19.9\n26.4\n23.3\n28.2\n25.9\n29.7\n\nModel\nM1\nM2\nM3\nM4\nM5\nM6\nM7\nM8\n\nr\u2212Kerr\n18.35\n25.82\n19.39\n26.33\n22.22\n27.94\n24.37\n29.18\n\nr\u2212PRS\n18.73\n25.88\n19.89\n26.42\n23.24\n28.18\n25.78\n29.58\n\n\u03bdMS\n[kHz]\nK\n0.99\n0.73\n0.93\n0.71\n0.77\n0.65\n0.67\n0.61\n\n\u03bdKerr\nK\n1.023\n0.734\n0.960\n0.715\n0.816\n0.660\n0.731\n0.623\n\n\u03bdPRS\nK\n0.997\n0.732\n0.928\n0.712\n0.768\n0.652\n0.678\n0.611\n\n\u03bdMS\n[Hz]\nLT\n21.7\n12.4\n24.0\n14.7\n28.2\n20.5\n28.9\n23.2\n\n\u03bdKerr\nLT\n22.61\n12.43\n25.79\n15.08\n32.59\n21.19\n34.62\n24.40\n\n\u03bdPRS\nLT\n21.39\n12.36\n24.04\n14.94\n28.78\n20.70\n29.64\n23.48\n\n\u03bdMS\nz [Hz]\n29.0\n13.6\n32.9\n16.4\n41.3\n24.1\n43.4\n28.4\n\n\u03bdKerr\nz\n23.88\n12.95\n27.61\n15.88\n36.31\n23.03\n39.56\n27.12\n\n\u03bdPRS\nz\n29.70\n13.46\n34.20\n16.57\n44.65\n24.51\n47.90\n29.22\n\nTABLE 3\nSame as in Table 2, but for the counter-rotating case.\n\n\u2212\n\nGX 5\n\n1\n\nSco X1\n\n44\n\nGX 17\n\n4U 1636\n\n53\n\nGX 340 +0\n\n.\n\n2\n\n140\n\n4U 0614 +091\n\n\u2212\n\n4U 1728\n\n34\n\n120\n\u03bdzP [Hz]\n\n0 5\n\n.\n\n\u03bd\u03c1\n\n100\n80\n60\n\n.\n\n0 3\n\n40\n\nos\n\n[kHz]\n\n0 4\n\n.\n\n0 2\n\n20\n0. 0\n\n.\n\n0 1\n\n140\n\n.\n\n120\n\u03bdzP [Hz]\n\n0. 5\n0. 4\n\n100\n80\n60\n\n0. 3\n\n40\n\n0. 2\n\n20\n\n0. 1\n\n0. 0\n0. 0\n\n0. 0\n0. 0\n\n\u03bdK[kHz]\n4U 1728\u221234\n\n160\n\n0 0\n\n\u03bd\u03c1os [kHz]\n\n4U 1728\u221234\n\n160\n\nCir X1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n4U 1735\n\n0.2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n1. 0\n\u03bdK[kHz]\n\n1. 2\n\n1. 4\n\n1. 6\n\nFig. 9.- Periastron oscillation frequency, \u03bdOS\n\u03c1 , as a function of the Keplerian\nfrequency \u03bdK for the NS realistic models in Table 2.

For the sake of comparison we show\nthe low frequency branch observed in the LMXB 4U 1728\u201334\n(see Ford and van der Klis 1998, for details). From the analysis of the pulsating X-ray flux it turns out that very likely the\nspin frequency of the NS in 4U 1728\u201334 is \u223c 363 Hz (see\nStrohmayer et al. 1996, for details). Thus, the models M3\n(M0 = 1.94M\u2299 , j = 0.24) and M4 (M0 = 2.71M\u2299 , j = 0.18) in\nTable 2 that correspond to a NS of spin frequency 360 Hz are\nof particular interest for the analysis of this source.

The black curves in Fig. 10 indicate the\n2\u03bdPz -\u03bdK relation for the models M3 and M4 (solid and dashed)\nfollowing the above suggestion. Although the improvement\nof the fit is evident, we notice that the NS parameters that\ncorrectly reproduce the features of 4U 1728\u201334 are likely in\nbetween the models M3 and M4.\n7. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWe have done an extensive comparison of the orbital motion of neutral test particles in the PRS and Kerr spacetime\ngeometries. In particular we have emphasized on the Keplerian and frame-dragging frequencies, as well as the precession\nand oscillation frequencies of the radial and vertical motions.\nWe have evidentiated the differences in this respect between\nthe Kerr and PRS solution, especially in the rapid \u223ckHz rotation regime. Such differences are the manifestation of the\ninfluence of the high order multipole moments such as the\nquadrupole and octupole.\n\n\f12\n\nPach\u00f3n et al.\n\nThe analysis of the deviations between the Kerr and PRS\nfeatures for given mass and angular momentum of a source\nstudied in this work are useful to distinguish the signatures\nbetween BHs and NSs, which relevant to establish a separatrix for the identification of the compact objects harbored in\nX-Ray Binaries. In the case of BH candidates, these results\nmight become important for testing the no-hair theorem of\nBHs (see e.g. Johannsen and Psaltis 2011). Equally important,\nthe application of the precession and oscillation frequencies\nto the explanation of QPOs in LMXBs possessing a NS, can\nunveil information on the NS parameters, leading to a possible identification of the behavior of the nuclear matter EoS at\nsupranuclear densities. In this line, the identification of the rotation frequency of NSs in LMXBs from the pulsating X-ray\nflux \u03bdburst , e.g. the case of 4U 1728\u201334 (Ford and van der Klis\n1998), 4U 1916\u2013053 (Galloway et al. 2001) and more recently\nthe case of IGR J17191\u20132821 (Altamirano et al. 2010), will\ncertainly help to constrain QPO models as well as the NS\nparameters. Additional information coming from the photospheric radius expansion phenomena observed in these systems (see e.g. Muno et al. 2001, for details) during their transient activity with Super-Eddington emission can become of\nparamount importance if combined with the QPO information.\nThe generalization of the present work to the electrovacuum case is important to establish the influence of the magnetic dipole and quadrupole moments on the orbital motion of\nparticles around compact objects (see e.g. Bakala et al. 2010;\nSanabria-G\u00f3mez et al. 2010; Bakala et al. 2012).\nInteresting effects on the epicyclic frequencies due to the\npresence of the magnetic dipole have been already pointed\nout recently by Bakala et al. (2010) and Bakala et al. (2012).\nThese effects were predicted after neglecting the contribution of the electromagnetic field to the curvature, for j = 0\nsee Bakala et al. (2010) and for j , 0 Bakala et al. (2012).\nBakala et al. (2010) assumed the model of the star as a dipole\nmagnetic field superposed on a Schwarzschild black hole.\nIn the second work, they studied the case of a magnetized\nslowly rotating neutron stars; to build the model they super-\n\npose an dipolar magnetic field on the Lense-Thirring geometry. The effects of the magnetic dipole on the location of\nthe ISCO, within the PRS solution, has been investigated by\nSanabria-G\u00f3mez et al. (2010).\nA complete analysis of the effects due to the emergence of\nelectromagnetic structure on the orbital motion of charged\nparticles is therefore of interest and deserve the appropriate attention. Recent observations have shown that for\nstars with strong magnetic fields the quadrupole and octupole magnetic terms make significant contributions to the\nmagnetic field (Donati et al. 2006), which indicates that\narbitrary higher order multipole components might be required in a realistic model. The presence of a magnetic\nquadrupole demands the breaking of the reflection symmetry\n(see Pach\u00f3n and Sanabria-G\u00f3mez 2006, for details), by means\nof a slightly change to the Ernst electric potential over the\nsymmetry axis\nf (z) =\n\nqz2 + i\u03bcz + i\u03b6\n,\nz3 + z2 (m \u2212 ia) \u2212 kz + is\n\n(31)\n\na quadrupolar magnetic component B2 = \u03b6 can be introduced\nto the PRS solution. Such a change generates just a redefinition of the coefficients fi in Eq. (15). In this way the PRS\nsolution can be readily use to explore the effect of strong magnetic fields with non-dipolar structure.\nThe authors thank Emanuele Berti for directing our attention to the astrophysical relevance of the periastron and\nnodal precession frequencies.
