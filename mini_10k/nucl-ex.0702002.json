These new data provide a\nbenchmark for calculations based on quantum chromodynamics. Two of the five existing models have\nmade predictions of polarization observables. Both explain the longitudinal polarization transfer\nsatisfactorily. Transverse polarizations are not well described, but suggest isovector dominance.\nPACS numbers: 25.20.-x, 24.70.+s, 24.85.+p, 25.10.+s\n\nAn important question to nuclear physics is whether\none can understand exclusive nuclear reactions starting\nfrom quantum chromodynamics (QCD), or at least QCDinspired quark models. Several studies of nuclei [1\u20134]\nat high momentum transfer, but in elastic or quasifree\nkinematics, have shown that the role of explicit quark\ndegrees of freedom is subtle and elusive; even data that\nprobe short ranges can be understood with hadronic theories with the underlying interactions determined from\nthe measured N N force and other inputs. Deuteron\nphotodisintegration is unique among exclusive reactions,\nin that it has been measured at both large momentum\ntransfer and large energies. Experiments [5\u201310] have\nshown that the cross section in the GeV region scales,\napproximately following the constituent counting rules\n[11, 12], as would be expected if the underlying dynamics involved quark degrees of freedom. The large energies\ninvolve a sum over large numbers of baryonic resonances,\nleading naturally to the idea of using quark degrees of\n\nfreedom to explain the data, although perturbative QCD\nis not expected to apply [13].\nSeveral quark model calculations [14\u201318] give competing approximate explanations of the photodisintegration\ncross sections. All but one are based on the idea that the\nhigh energy photon is absorbed by a pair of quarks being\ninterchanged between the two nucleons; the quark-gluon\nstring (QGS) model [15] uses Regge theory to evaluate\n3-quark exchange. The models calibrated by the measured N N force [15, 16, 18] tend to better reproduce the\ncross sections than the models which evaluate the quarkexchange diagram approximately [14, 17]. The reason\n[17] is that the data scale better with energy than one\nwould expect for the measured energy range.\nPolarization observables provide potentially stricter\ntests of the underlying dynamics [19, 20]. For example,\nthe \u03a3 (linearly polarized photon) asymmetry, measured\nup to 1.6 GeV, is important for constraining the isoscalar\nvs. isovector nature of the photon coupling at high en-\n\n\f2\nergy [19]. For the recoil proton polarizations, measured\nat \u03b8cm = 90\u25e6 up to 2.4 GeV [22], the induced polarization\npy vanishes, but the polarization transfers Cx\u2032 and Cz\u2032 do\nnot, although they are consistent with a slow approach\nto zero. Thus, while hadron helicity conservation (HHC)\n[23] does not hold, a slow approach to HHC cannot be\nruled out, but it is not expected [24]. Very small induced\npolarizations, consistent with the data, were predicted\nby the hard rescattering (HR) model [20], based on modeled pn helicity amplitudes. Here, we present new data at\nlarge energy and four-momentum transfer, to further test\nthe theoretical models. These data are the only polarization angular distribution in deuteron photodisintegration\nmeasured significantly above 1 GeV.\nThe experiment (E00-007) ran in Hall A of the Thomas\nJefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) [25]. A\nstrained GaAs crystal produced the longitudinally polarized electron beam. The beam helicity state was flipped\npseudo-randomly at 30 Hz. Beam charge asymmetries\nbetween the two helicity states were negligible. The Hall\nA M\u00f8ller polarimeter determined the average beam polarization, Pe , to be 76% \u00b1 0.3% (statistics) \u00b1 3.0% (systematics).\nCircularly polarized bremsstrahlung photons were generated when the 2.057-GeV electron beam impinged on a\ncopper radiator with a thickness of 6% radiation length,\nlocated 20 cm upstream of the center of a 15-cm liquid\ndeuterium target. The ratio of the photon polarization\nP\u03b3 to Pe is calculable [26]; here P\u03b3 /Pe \u2248 99.5%.\nRecoil protons from the target were detected in the\nHall A left high resolution spectrometer (HRSL) at the\nfive kinematic settings listed in Table I. The scattering angles, momentum, and interaction position at the\ntarget were calculated from trajectories measured with\nVertical Drift Chambers (VDCs) located in the focal\nplane. Two planes of plastic scintillators provided triggering and flight time information for particle identification. The incident photon energy was reconstructed\nfrom the scattered proton momentum and angle using\ntwo-body photodisintegration kinematics. Only events\nbetween the bremsstrahlung endpoint and the pion production threshold were used in the analysis.\nThe final element in the detector stack was the focal\nplane polarimeter (FPP) [27]. To improve its efficiency,\nwe configured the polarimeter with a dual analyzer system, as in [28]. The VDC chambers, a 44-cm thick\npolyethylene (CH2 ) analyzer, and front straw chambers\nconstituted the first polarimeter, while the front straw\nchambers, a 49.5-cm carbon analyzer, and rear straw\nchambers constituted a second, independent polarimeter.\nThe HRSL spectrometer transverse angle and transverse position resolutions (FWHM) are 2.6 mrad and 4\nmm, respectively [25]. Events originating from the target windows were eliminated by cuts on the interaction\nposition. In addition to cuts based on particle's position\nand direction at the target, a set of 2-dimensional pro-\n\nTABLE I: Kinematics of the data and FPP parameters.

The focal plane profiles were obtained\nfrom continuous-momentum spectra taken without the\nbremsstrahlung radiator. The subtraction of background\nprocesses from electro-disintegration used the same techniques as for previous photodisintegration cross-section\n[5\u20139] and polarization [22, 29] measurements.\nThe transverse proton polarization components at\nthe focal plane lead to azimuthal asymmetries in rescattering in the analyzer due to spin-orbit interactions.\nThe alignment of the FPP chambers was determined\nwith straight-through trajectories, with the analyzers removed. Spin transport in the spectrometer was taken\ninto account using a magnetic model calculation. The\ninduced (transferred) polarization was determined by a\nmaximum likelihood method using the sum (difference)\nof the azimuthal distributions corresponding to the two\nbeam helicity states. If necessary, the proton polarization components obtained in the laboratory frame are\ntransformed into the center-of-mass frame.

Polarization transfer in elastic ~ep scattering determines both the ratio of the proton\n\n\f3\nelectromagnetic form factors [35\u201338] and the FPP calibration, after accounting for beam polarization and spin\ntransport through the spectrometer; see Table II. Our\nmeasurements agree well with previous data for analyzing powers of carbon and CH2 analyzers [27, 28, 39, 40]\nand for the form factor ratio [27]. For the \u03b3d data at\np\n\u03b8cm\n= 109.5\u25e6, only the carbon analyzer was used due to\nthe low outgoing proton momentum; the analyzing power\nwas taken from an earlier ~ep calibration run with the\nsame FPP set up [34]. For the four kinematics with dual\nanalyzers, recoil polarizations were consistent between\nthe two analyzers within uncertainties, and the weighted\naverages are given as the final results in Table III.\nTABLE III: Center-of-mass frame proton recoil polarization\ncomponents, with statistical and systematical uncertainties.\np\n\u03b8cm\n36.9\u25e6\n\n52.9\u25e6\n69.8\u25e6\n89.8\u25e6\n109.5\u25e6\n\npy\n-0.301 \u00b1 0.053\n\u00b1 0.029\n-0.209 \u00b1 0.041\n\u00b1 0.052\n0.008 \u00b1 0.033\n\u00b1 0.039\n-0.090 \u00b1 0.049\n\u00b1 0.045\n0.226 \u00b1 0.073\n\u00b1 0.053\n\nCx\u2032\n-0.170 \u00b1 0.041\n\u00b1 0.020\n-0.205 \u00b1 0.040\n\u00b1 0.031\n-0.228 \u00b1 0.045\n\u00b1 0.033\n0.065 \u00b1 0.074\n\u00b1 0.034\n0.316 \u00b1 0.082\n\u00b1 0.035\n\nCz\u2032\n0.654 \u00b1 0.056\n\u00b1 0.051\n0.573 \u00b1 0.071\n\u00b1 0.092\n0.835 \u00b1 0.108\n\u00b1 0.116\n0.453 \u00b1 0.162\n\u00b1 0.065\n0.001 \u00b1 0.119\n\u00b1 0.037\n\nThere are several systematic uncertainties. The statistical uncertainties of the measured analyzing powers\ndominate over the beam polarization uncertainty. Spectrometer offsets also contribute. Potential geometrical\nbiases are eliminated by requiring that all possible secondary scattering proton azimuthal angles (\u03c6F P P ) fall\ninto the boundaries of the polarimeter. The induced polarization py in ep elastic scattering vanishes \u2013 neglecting small effects from two-photon exchange \u2013 allowing a\ndirect measurement of the false asymmetries in the polarimeter. The ep induced polarization measurements\nwere all consistent with vanishing, so the statistical accuracies of py in the ep calibration (\u2264 0.04), were assigned\nas the false asymmetry systematic uncertainties of the induced polarization in deuteron photodisintegration. For\nthe polarization transfer, the false asymmetries largely\ncancel in forming the helicity differences.\nFigure 1 compares the proton recoil polarization of this\nwork (E00-007), at E\u03b3 \u2248 2 GeV, with earlier results (Wijesooriya) [22] at E\u03b3 = 1.86 GeV, and calculations. A\nslow energy dependence of the recoil polarizations above\nE\u03b3 \u2248 1 GeV was found in [22], and our new measurements at \u03b8cm = 90\u25e6 are compatible with the earlier results. All three polarization components are consistent\nwith a smooth variation with angle, and with crossing\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Polarization transfers Cx\u2032 , Cz\u2032 and induced polarization py in deuteron photodisintegration. Only\nstatistical uncertainties are shown. See text for details.\n\nzero near \u03b8cm = 90\u25e6 . Both Cx\u2032 and py start out negative\nand moderately sized at forward angles, while Cz\u2032 is positive and large. As py and Cx\u2032 do not generally vanish,\nwe again confirm that HHC does not hold.\nThe longitudinal polarization is given by [41]\nf (\u03b8)Cz\u2032 =\n\n6 X\nX\n\n\u00b1|Fi,\u00b1 |2 ,\n\n(1)\n\ni=1 \u00b1\n\nwith f (\u03b8) the cross section. It is insensitive to phases\nof amplitudes. Except for the negative signs, Cz\u2032 would\nequal the cross section, and could be predicted as reliably.\nIn contrast, Cx\u2032 and py are the real and imaginary parts\nof the same sum of interfering amplitudes [13, 41], and\nare highly sensitive to phases, and difficult to predict.\nTwo calculations of the spin observables are available.\nFigure 1 shows that the QGS model [19] predicts a longitudinal polarization transfer in good qualitative agreement with the measured data, but makes no prediction\nfor the transverse polarizations, due to their sensitivity\nto phases. Given the good agreement with deuteron photodisintegration cross sections in the few GeV region [10],\nthe QGS model must be regarded as the most successful\nexisting model of photodisintegration at a few GeV.\nFigure 1 also shows predictions for all three observables\nfrom the HR model [20]. It should be noted that these\ncalculations are at the lower edge of the nominal validity\nrange of the model. Also, since the pn spin amplitudes\n\n\f4\nare not well constrained by data, the pn amplitudes are\nbased on pp data. Thus, there are large uncertainties in\nthe predictions. One calculation (dotted line) assumes\nthat there is only small helicity nonconservation, leading to small values of Cx\u2032 and py , and Cz\u2032 being nearly\nunity [43]. The second (dash-dot line) calculation assumes large helicity non-conservation. The comparison\nwith all observables supports large helicity nonconservation, but clearly the predictions for the transverse polarization are not in sufficiently good agreement. However,\nref. [20] points out that the transverse polarizations are\napproximately proportional to a particular amplitude in\npn scattering (\"\u03c65 \") that vanishes at \u03b8cm = 90\u25e6 in the\nisovector channel. Thus, the transverse polarization data\nmight be indicating that the isovector channel dominates\nover the isoscalar channel, more so than in the calculation. This observation is consistent with the situation\nin the \u03a3 asymmetry, mentioned above. While the HR\nmodel does not agree quite as well as the QGS model\nwith Cz\u2032 or with the cross sections for energies around 2\nGeV, it is at least as successful at predicting cross section above about 3 GeV [13], and its py predictions are\nconsistent with the large-angle data.\nTo summarize, we provide new benchmark data for\npolarizations in deuteron photodisintegration. The two\nmodels which predict the longitudinal polarization transfer, the QGS and HR models, are in qualitative agreement with these data; while neither model adequately\nexplains the transverse polarizations, the HR model indicates the qualitative behavior might arise from isovector\ndominance. High-energy photodisintegration of pp pairs\n[42] is the next major test of the underlying dynamics\nand of the theoretical models, as these two models give\nvery different predictions for pp photodisintegration.\nWe thank Drs.
