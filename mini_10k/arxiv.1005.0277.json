Using first-principles density-functional\ntheory, in this paper we systematically study the structural, electronic, mechanical, thermodynamic\nproperties, and pressure induced structural transition of PuO2 . To properly describe the strong\ncorrelation in Pu 5f electrons, the local density approximation+U and the generalized gradient\napproximation+U theoretical formalisms have been employed. We optimize U parameter in calculating the total energy, lattice parameters, and bulk modulus at nonmagnetic, ferromagnetic,\nand antiferromagnetic configurations for both ground state fluorite structure and high pressure\ncotunnite structure. Best agreement with experiments is obtained by tuning the effective Hubbard\nparameter U at around 4 eV within LDA+U approach.

Additionally,\nas an illustration on the valency trend and subsequent effect on the mechanical properties, the\ncalculated results for other actinide metal dioxides (ThO2 , UO2 , and NpO2 ) are also presented.\nPACS numbers: 71.27.+a, 61.50.Ks, 62.20.-x, 63.20.dk\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nActinide elements and compounds possess particular interesting physical behaviors due\nto the 5f states and have always attracted extensive attention because of their importance\nin nuclear fuel cycle [1\u20134]. Actinide dioxides, AO2 (A=Th, U, Np or Pu), are universally\nused as advanced fuel materials for nuclear reactors and PuO2 also plays an important role\nin the plutonium re-use, separation and/or long-term storage. Recently, there has occurred\nin the literature a series of experimental reports [5\u20137] on the strategies of storage of Pubased waste. Exposure to air and moisture, metallic plutonium surface easily oxidizes to\nPu2 O3 and PuO2 . Although the existence of PuO2+x (x \u22640.27) was reported by Haschke\net al. [5], recent photoemission study found that PuO2 was only covered by a chemisorbed\nlayer of oxygen and can be easily desorbed at elevated temperature [7], therefore, PuO2 is\nthe stablest plutonium oxide. At ambient condition PuO2 crystallizes in a fluorite structure\nwith space group Fm3\u0304m (No. 225). Its cubic unit cell is composed of four PuO2 formula\nunits with plutonium atoms and oxygen atoms in 4a and 8c sites, respectively. By using\nthe energy dispersive x-ray diffraction method, Dancausse et al [8] reported that at 39 GPa,\nPuO2 undergoes a phase transition to an orthorhombic structure of cotunnite type with\nspace group Pnma (No. 62).\nAs for the electronic-structure study of PuO2 , conventional density functional theory\n(DFT) that applies the local density approximation (LDA) or generalized gradient approximation (GGA) underestimates the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion of the 5f electrons\nand, consequently, describes PuO2 as incorrect ferromagnetic (FM) conductor [9] instead of\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator reported by experiment [10]. Same problems have\nbeen confirmed in studying other correlated materials within the pure LDA/GGA schemes.\nFortunately, several approaches, the LDA/GGA+U [11\u201313], the hybrid density functional\nof HSE [14], and the self-interaction corrected local spin-density (SIC-LSD) [15], have been\ndeveloped to correct these failures in calculations of actinide compounds. The effective modification of pure DFT by LDA/GGA+U formalisms has been confirmed widely in study of\nUO2 [11, 13] and PuO2 [16\u201320]. By tuning the effective Hubbard parameter in a reasonable\nrange, the AFM Mott insulator feature was correctly calculated and the structural parameters as well as the electronic structure are well in accord with experiments. Lattice dynamical\nproperties of UO2 and PuO2 and various contributions to their thermal conductivities were\n2\n\n\fstudied by using a combination of LDA and Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) [21].\nHowever, despite that abundant researches on the structural, electronic, optical, thermodynamic properties of plutonium dioxide have been performed, relatively little is known\nregarding its chemical bonding, mechanical properties, and phonon dispersion. In addition,\nthe pressure induced structural transition has also not yet been studied by first-principles\nDFT+U calculations.\nIn this work, we have systematically calculated the ground-state structural parameters,\nelectronic, mechanical, thermodynamic properties, and pressure induced structural transition of PuO2 by employing the LDA+U and GGA+U schemes due to Dudarev et al.\n[11\u201313]. The validity of the ground-state calculation is carefully tested. Our calculated\nlattice parameter and bulk modulus B are well consistent with previous LDA+U results\n[18]. The total energy, structural parameters, bulk modulus B, and pressure derivative of\nthe bulk modulus B\u2032 for AFM and FM phases calculated in wide range of effective Hubbard\nU parameter are presented and our electronic spectrum reproduce briefly the main feature\nof our previous study [16]. In addition, the bonding nature of A\u2212O bond in PuO2 , NpO2 ,\nUO2 , and ThO2 involving its mixed ionic/covalent character is investigated by performing\nthe Bader analysis [22, 23]. We find that about 2.40, 2.48, 2.56, and 2.66 electrons transfer from each Pu, Np, U or Th atom to O atom, respectively. In study of the mechanical\nproperties, we first calculate the elastic constants of both Fm3\u0304m and Pnma phases and then\nthe elastic moduli, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature are deduced from the calculated\nelastic constants. Hardness and ideal tensile strength of Fm3\u0304m PuO2 are also obtained by\nLDA+U approach with one typical value of effective U parameter. The hardness of PuO2\nis equal to 26.6 GPa and the ideal tensile strengthes are calculated to be 81.2, 28.3, and\n16.8 GPa for pulling in the [001], [110], and [111] directions, respectively. As for the thermodynamic study, the phonon dispersion illustrates the stability of PuO2 and we further\npredict the lattice vibration energy, thermal expansion, and specific heat by utilizing the\nquasiharmonic approximation based on the first-principles phonon density of state (DOS).\nOne more aim of the present work is to extend the description of PuO2 to high pressures.\nThe electronic, structural, and magnetic behavior of PuO2 under pressure up to 280 GPa\nhave been evaluated. Results show that there occurs a metallic transition at around 133\nGPa for Pnma phase. The isostructural transition, similar to UO2 [24] and ThO2 [25], in\npressure domain of 75-133 GPa is predicted. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows.\n3\n\n\fIn Sec. II the computational method is briefly described. In Sec. III we present and discuss\nour results. In Sec. IV we summarize the conclusions of this work.\n\nII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL METHODS\n\nThe DFT calculations are performed on the basis of the frozen-core projected augmented\nwave (PAW) method of Bl\u00f6chl [26] encoded in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)\n[27] using the LDA and GGA [28, 29]. For the plane-wave set, a cutoff energy of 500 eV\nis used. The k -point meshes in the full wedge of the Brillouin zone (BZ) are sampled by\n9\u00d79\u00d79 and 9\u00d715\u00d79 grids according to the Monkhorst-Pack [30] scheme for fluorite and\ncotunnite PuO2 , respectively, and all atoms are fully relaxed until the Hellmann-Feynman\nforces become less than 0.02 eV/\u00c5. The plutonium 6s 2 7s 2 6p 6 6d 2 5f 4 and the oxygen 2s 2 2p 4\nelectrons are treated as valence electrons. The strong on-site Coulomb repulsion among the\nlocalized Pu 5f electrons is described by using the LDA/GGA+U formalisms formulated by\nDudarev et al. [11\u201313], where the double counting correction has already been included. As\nconcluded in some previous studies of actinide dioxides (AO2 ), although the pure LDA and\nGGA fail to depict the electronic structure, especially the insulating nature and the occupiedstate character of UO2 [24, 31], NpO2 [18, 32], and PuO2 [16, 17, 19], the LDA/GGA+U\napproaches will capture the Mott insulating properties of the strongly correlated U 5f, Np\n5f, and Pu 5f electrons in AO2 adequately. In this paper the Coulomb U is treated as a\nvariable, while the exchange energy is set to be a constant J=0.75 eV. This value of J is\nsame with our previous study of plutonium oxides [16, 17]. Since only the difference between\nU and J is significant [12], thus we will henceforth label them as one single parameter, for\nsimplicity labeled as U, while keeping in mind that the non-zero J has been used during\ncalculations.\nBoth spin-unpolarized and spin-polarized calculations are performed in this study. Compared to FM and AFM phases, the nonmagnetic (NM) phase is not energetically favorable\nboth in the LDA+U and GGA+U formalisms. Therefore, the results of NM are not presented in the following. The dependence of the total energy (per formula unit at respective\noptimum geometries) on U for both FM and AFM phases within the LDA+U and GGA+U\nformalisms is shown in Fig. 1. At U =0 and 1.0 eV, the total energy of the FM phase is lower\nthan that of the AFM phase either in LDA+U scheme or GGA+U scheme. However, as\n4\n\n\fTotal Energy (eV)\n\n-30\n\n-32\n\n-34\nFM GGA+U\nAFM GGA+U\nFM LDA+U\n\n-36\n\nAFM LDA+U\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nU (eV)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Dependence of the total energies (per formula unit) on U for FM and AFM\nPuO2 .\n\nshown in Fig. 1, it is clear that the total energy of the AFM phase decreases to become lower\nthan that of the FM phase when increasing U. The total-energy differences (EFM \u2212EAFM )\nwithin the LDA+U and GGA+U at U =4 eV are 0.705 and 0.651 eV, respectively. Both FM\nand AFM results will be presented in the following analysis. Besides, while the spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) is important for certain properties of heavy metal compounds, it has been\nnumerically found [9, 33] and physically analyzed [14, 34] that the inclusion of the SOC has\nlittle effect on the bulk and one-electron properties of UO2 and PuO2 . Our test calculations\nalso show that within LDA+U approach with U =4 eV, inclusion of SOC will increase the\noptimum lattice constant by only 0.7% and the bulk modulus by about 0.5 GPa. Therefore,\nin our following calculations of plutonium dioxide, the SOC is not included.\nIn present work, the theoretical equilibrium volume, bulk modulus B, and pressure derivative of the bulk modulus B\u2032 are obtained by fitting the energy-volume data with the thirdorder Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (EOS) [35]. In order to calculate elastic constants,\na small strain is applied onto the structure. For small strain \u01eb, Hooke's law is valid and the\ncrystal energy E(V, \u01eb) can be expanded as a Taylor series [36],\nE(V, \u01eb) = E(V0 , 0) + V0\n\n6\nX\ni=1\n\n6\nV0 X\nCij ei ej + O({e3i }),\n\u03c3i ei +\n2 i,j=1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E(V0 , 0) is the energy of the unstrained system with the equilibrium volume V0 , \u01eb is\n\n5\n\n\fstrain tensor which has matrix elements \u03b5ij (i, j=1, 2, and 3) defined by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n1\ne\ne e\n\uf8ec 1 2 6 2 5\uf8f7\n\uf8ec1\n\uf8f7\n\u03b5ij = \uf8ec 2 e6 e2 21 e4 \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n1\n1\ne\ne\ne\n3\n2 5 2 4\n\n(2)\n\nand Cij are the elastic constants. For cubic structures, there are three independent elastic\nconstants (C11 , C12 , and C44 ). So, the elastic constants for fluorite PuO2 can be calculated\nfrom three different strains listed as follows:\n\u01eb1 = (\u03b4, \u03b4, \u03b4, 0, 0, 0), \u01eb2 = (\u03b4, 0, \u03b4, 0, 0, 0), \u01eb3 = (0, 0, 0, \u03b4, \u03b4, \u03b4).\n\n(3)\n\nThe strain amplitude \u03b4 is varied in steps of 0.006 from \u03b4=\u22120.036 to 0.036 and the total\nenergies E(V, \u03b4) at these strain steps are calculated. After obtaining elastic constants, we\ncan calculate bulk and shear moduli from the Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH) approximations [37].\nThe Voigt (Reuss) bounds on the bulk modulus BV (BR ) and shear modulus GV (GR ) for\nthis cubic crystal system are deduced from the formulae of elastic moduli in Ref. [38]. As\nfor cotunnite PuO2 , the nine independent elastic constants (C11 , C12 , C13 , C22 , C23 , C33 ,\nC44 , C55 , and C66 ) can be obtained from nine different strains listed in the following:\n\u01eb1 = (\u03b4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), \u01eb2 = (0, \u03b4, 0, 0, 0, 0), \u01eb3 = (0, 0, \u03b4, 0, 0, 0),\n\u01eb4 = (0, 0, 0, \u03b4, 0, 0), \u01eb5 = (0, 0, 0, 0, \u03b4, 0), \u01eb6 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \u03b4),\n\u01eb7 = (\u03b4, \u03b4, 0, 0, 0, 0), \u01eb8 = (0, \u03b4, \u03b4, 0, 0, 0), \u01eb9 = (\u03b4, 0, \u03b4, 0, 0, 0)\n\n(4)\n\nand the formulae of elastic moduli in VRH approximations [37] are from Ref. [39]. Based\non the Hill approximation [37], B = 21 (BR + BV ) and G= 21 (GR + GV ). The Young's modulus\nE and Poisson's ratio \u03c5 are given by the following formulae:\nE = 9BG/(3B + G), \u03c5 = (3B \u2212 2G)/[2(3B + G)].\n\n(5)\n\nIn addition, the elastic properties of a solid can also be related to thermodynamical parameters especially specific heat, thermal expansion, Debye temperature, melting point, and\nGr\u00fcneisen parameter [40]. From this point of view, Debye temperature is one of fundamental parameters for solid materials. Due to the fact that at low temperatures the vibrational\nexcitations arise solely from acoustic vibrations, therefore, the Debye temperature calculated\n\n6\n\n\ffrom elastic constants is the same as that determined from specific heat measurements. The\nrelation between the Debye temperature (\u03b8D ) and the average sound wave velocity (\u03c5m ) is\nh\n\u03b8D =\nkB\n\n\u0012\n\n3n\n4\u03c0\u03a9\n\n\u00131/3\n\n\u03c5m ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere h and kB are Planck and Boltzmann constants, respectively, n is the number of atoms\nin the molecule and \u03a9 is molecular volume.

All these values are determined by EOS fitting. For comparison, the experimental\nvalues of a0 (Ref. [5]) and B (Ref. [41]) are also listed. In the overall view, the dependence\nof the lattice parameter a0 of AFM PuO2 on U is well consistent with our previous study\n[16] either in LDA+U scheme or in GGA+U scheme. For the LDA/GGA+U approaches,\nthe calculated a0 improves upon the pure LDA/GGA by steadily increasing its amplitude\nwith U. Actually, at a typical value U =4 eV, the LDA+U gives a0 =5.362 \u00c5, which is very\nclose to the experimental value of 5.398 \u00c5, and the GGA+U gives a0 =5.466 \u00c5. Note that\nrecent PBE+U [19] and LDA+U [18] calculations with U =4.0 eV and J =0.7 eV predicted\nthe lattice parameter of AFM PuO2 to be 5.444 and 5.354 \u00c5, respectively, and the HSE\n[14] and SIC-LSD [15] calculations gave the values to be 5.385 and 5.44 \u00c5, respectively. On\nthe other hand, as shown in Table I, the tendency of a0 with U for FM PuO2 is similar to\nthat of the AFM phase. At a typical value U =4 eV, the LDA/GGA+U give a0 =5.338 and\n5.452 \u00c5. These values are slightly smaller than those of the AFM phase. Previous HSE [14]\ncalculation of FM PuO2 gave the lattice parameter to be 5.387 \u00c5.

Apparently, the\nGGA+U approach gives more close values to the experimental data of B =178 GPa [41]. In\nour present study, as shown in Table II, the bulk modulus B deduced from elastic constants\nturns out to be very close to that obtained by EOS fitting. This indicates that our calculations are consistent and reliable. In addition, as listed in Table II, recent PBE+U [19]\nand LDA+U [18] calculations with U =4.0 eV and J =0.7 eV predicted the bulk modulus\nB of AFM PuO2 to be 199 and 226 GPa, respectively, and the HSE [14] and SIC-LSD [15]\ncalculations gave the the bulk modulus to be 221 and 214 GPa, respectively.

Overall, comparing with the experimental data and recent theoretical results, the accuracy of our atomic-structure prediction for AFM PuO2 is quite satisfactory by tuning the\neffective Hubbard parameter U in a range of 3-4 eV within the LDA/GGA+U approaches,\nwhich supplies the safeguard for our following study of electronic structure and mechanical\nproperties of PuO2 .\nThe total density of states (DOS) as well as the projected DOS for the Pu 5f and O\n2p orbitals within LDA, GGA, LDA+U, and GGA+U formalisms are shown in Fig. 2.\nClearly, our results reproduce all the features included in our previous work [16]. In particular, we recover the main conclusion that although the pure LDA and GGA fail to depict\nthe electronic structure, especially the insulating nature and the occupied-state character of\nPuO2 , by tuning the effective Hubbard parameter in a reasonable range, the LDA/GGA+U\napproaches can prominently improve upon the pure LDA/GGA calculations and, thus, can\nprovide a satisfactory qualitative electronic structure description comparable with the pho-\n\n9\n\n\f20\n\nDOS (arb. units)\n\n15\n\nTotal\n\n(a) LDA\n\n(c) GGA\n\nPu-5f\n\n10\n\nO-2p\n\n5\n20\n0\n15\n\n(d) GGA+U\n\n(b) LDA+U\n\n10\n5\n0\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6 -6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The total DOS for the PuO2 AFM phase computed in the (a) LDA, (b)\nLDA+U (U =4), (c) GGA, and (d) GGA+U (U =4) formalisms.

In this study, the insulating energy band gap (E g ) is of 1.5 eV\nat U =4 eV within LDA/GGA+U approaches (see Table II). In Table II, the experimental\n[10] value and previous theoretical calculations [14, 15, 18, 19] results are also listed for\ncomparison. Obviously, the HSE calculations result in a larger E g by \u223c1.9 eV [14] and our\ncalculated results are well consistent with the measured value and other theoretical results.\nThe calculated amplitude of local spin moment is \u223c4.1 \u03bcB (per Pu atom) for AFM PuO2\nwithin the two DFT+U schemes and this value is comparable to previous LDA/PBE+U\n[19] results of \u223c3.9 \u03bcB .\nTo understand the chemical bonding characters of fluorite PuO2 , we present in Fig. 3\nthe crystal structure of its cubic unit cell and the charge density map of the (110) plane\ncalculated in LDA+U formalism with U =4 eV for AFM phase. Evidently, the charge density\naround Pu and O ions are all near spherical distribution with slightly deformed toward the\ndirection to their nearest neighboring atoms and there are clear covalent bridges between Pu\nand O ions. In order to describe the ionic/covalent character quantitatively and more clearly,\nwe plot the line charge density distribution along the nearest Pu\u2212O bonds (not shown). A\nminimum value of charge density (0.53 e/\u00c53 ) along the Pu\u2212O bonds is obtained and is\nlisted in Table III.

In\nfollowing study, results of UO2 are all calculated using these Hubbard parameters either for\nground-state Fm3\u0304m phase or high pressure Pnma phase. The lattice parameter a0 =5.449\n\u00c5 and bulk modulus B =220.0 GPa for Fm3\u0304m UO2 obtained by EOS fitting are in perfect\nagreement with results of recent LDA+U calculation [18] (a0 =5.448 \u00c5 and B =218 GPa)\n11\n\n\fand experiments [41, 52] (a0 =5.47 \u00c5 and B =207 GPa). Charge analysis results of Fm3\u0304m\nUO2 are listed in Table III. Clearly, the minimum values of charge density for PuO2 and\nUO2 , comparable to that along the Np\u2212O bonds included in our previous study of NpO2\n[32], are prominently larger than that along the Th\u2212O bonds (0.45 e/\u00c53 ) in ThO2 [25].\nThis indicates that the Pu\u2212O, U\u2212O, and Np\u2212O bonds have stronger covalency than the\nTh\u2212O bonds. And this conclusion is in good accordance with previous HSE study of the\ncovalency in Ref. [2], in which significant orbital mixing and covalency in the intermediate\nregion (PuO2 -CmO2 ) of actinide dioxides was for the first time showed by the increasing\n5f -2p orbital energy degeneracy. Besides, the A\u2212O (A=Pu, Np, U or Th) bond distances\ncalculated in present study and our previous works [25, 32] are listed in Table III. Obviously,\nthe Pu\u2212O, Np\u2212O, and U\u2212O bond distances are all smaller than the Th\u2212O bond distance.\nThis fact illustrates that the covalency of AO2 has tight relation with their bond distances,\nthus influences their macroscopical properties, such as hardness and elasticity. To see the\nionicity of AO2 , results from the Bader analysis [22, 23] are presented in Table III. The\ncharge (QB ) enclosed within the Bader volume (VB ) is a good approximation to the total\nelectronic charge of an atom. Note that although we have included the core charge in charge\ndensity calculations, since we do not expect variations as far as the trends are concerned,\nonly the valence charge are listed. Here, same with our previous study, we apply U =4.6 eV\nand J =0.6 eV for the Np 5f orbitals in calculations of NpO2 . Based on the data in Table III\nand considering the valence electron numbers of Pu, Np, U, Th, and O atoms (16, 15, 14,\n12, and 6, respectively), in our study of AO2 , we find that about 2.40, 2.48, 2.56, and 2.66\nelectrons transfer from each Pu, Np, U or Th atom to O atom, respectively. This indicates\nthat the ionicity of AO2 shows decreasing trend with increasing Z.\n\nB.\n1.\n\nMechanical properties\nElastic properties\n\nOur calculated elastic constants, various moduli, and Poisson's ratio \u03c5 of the Fm3\u0304m\nPuO2 at 0 GPa are collected in Table II and those of the Pnma phase are listed in Table IV.\nObviously, the Fm3\u0304m phase of PuO2 is mechanically stable due to the fact that its elastic\n\n12\n\n\fTABLE IV: Calculated elastic constants, elastic moduli, pressure derivative of the bulk modulus\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nB , and Poisson's ratio \u03c5 for cotunnite-type PuO2 and UO2 at 0 GPa.

To avoid the Pulay stress problem, we perform the structure relaxation\ncalculations at fixed volumes rather than constant pressures. Note that different from the\nstructure optimization of the ground-state Fm3\u0304m phase, the coordinates of atoms and the\ncell shape of the Pnma phase are necessary to be optimized due to its internal degrees of\nfreedom. After fitting the energy-volume data to the EOS, we obtain the optimized structural lattice parameters a, b, and c for the Pnma PuO2 AFM phase at 0 GPa to be 5.889,\n3.562, and 6.821 \u00c5, respectively, giving V =143.1 \u00c53 . This volume is smaller than the equilibrium volume of 154.2 \u00c53 for the Fm3\u0304m phase. This feature implies that the Pnma phase\nwill become stable under compression. The elastic constants listed in Table IV indicate that\nthe Pnma PuO2 is also mechanically stable. Actually, they satisfy the following mechanical\nstability criteria [36] for the orthorhombic structure:\nC11 > 0, C22 > 0, C33 > 0, C44 > 0, C55 > 0, C66 > 0,\n[C11 + C22 + C33 + 2(C12 + C13 + C23 )] > 0,\n(C11 + C22 \u2212 2C12 ) > 0, (C11 + C33 \u2212 2C13 ) > 0,\n(C22 + C33 \u2212 2C23 ) > 0.\n\n(9)\n\nOne can see from Table IV that the calculated C12 , C23 , and C13 are largely smaller than C11 ,\nC22 , and C33 . Therefore, the mechanical stability criteria is easily satisfied. For comparison,\nwe have also calculated the elastic properties of UO2 in its ground-state fluorite phase and\n13\n\n\fhigh-pressure cotunnite phase within LDA+U formalism. For Fm3\u0304m phase, C11 =389.3\nGPa, C12 =138.9 GPa, C44 =71.3 GPa, B =222.4 GPa, G=89.5 GPa, E =236.8 GPa, and\nPoisson's ratio \u03c5=0.323. Results for Pnma UO2 are presented in Table IV. Clearly, both\nfluorite and cotunnite phases of UO2 are mechanically stable. Moreover, comparing results\nof bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, Young's modulus E, and Poisson's ratio \u03c5 for fluorite\nphase and cotunnite phase, they are almost equal to each other for PuO2 . Particularly,\nthe bulk modulus B is only smaller by about 5 GPa for Pnma phase compared to that of\nFm3\u0304m phase. As for UO2 , bulk modulus of cotunnite phase is smaller by approximately 9%,\nshear modulus and Young's modulus about 23%, compared to those of fluorite structure.\nBesides, in our previous study of ThO2 [25] we find that the bulk modulus, shear modulus,\nand Young's modulus of cotunnite ThO2 are all smaller by approximately 25% compared to\nthose of fluorite ThO2 . Therefore, after comparing the bulk modulus B for the two phases of\nThO2 , UO2 , and PuO2 , we find that the difference is decreasing along with increasing of 5f\nelectrons. This trend is understandable. Although the softening in bulk modulus upon phase\ntransition for these three systems is similar, the increase of 5f electrons of actinide metal\natoms will lead to more covalency and thus reduce the bulk modulus difference between the\ntwo phases of the actinide dioxides across the series. To study the anisotropy of the linear\nbulk modulus for Pnma PuO2 and UO2 , we calculate the directional bulk modulus along\nthe a, b and c axis by the following equations [40],\nBa =\n\nBa\nBa\n\u039b\n, Bb =\n, Bc =\n,\n1+\u03b1+\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u039b=C11 +2C12 \u03b1+C22 \u03b12 +2C13 \u03b2+C33 \u03b2 2 +2C23 \u03b1\u03b2.

After calculation, we obtain values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 to be 0.8939 (0.9875) and 0.8309\n(0.9135) for PuO2 (UO2 ), respectively. Results of Ba , Bb , and Bc are presented in Table\nIV. Clearly, results of the directional bulk moduli show that both Pnma PuO2 and UO2 are\neasily compressed along a axis at 0 GPa. The longest axis c is the hardest axis for these two\n14\n\n\fTABLE V: Calculated density (in g/cm3 ), transverse (\u03c5t ), longitudinal (\u03c5l ) and average (\u03c5m )\nsound velocities (in m/s) derived from bulk and shear modulus, and Debye temperature (in K) for\nactinide dioxides.

Directional bulk moduli of PuO2 are all bigger than the corresponding\nvalues of UO2 . Moreover, using results of elastic constants included in previous study [25],\nthe directional bulk moduli Ba , Bb , and Bc of Pnma ThO2 are calculated to be 528.3, 406.3,\nand 415.8 GPa, respectively. This illustrates that, in contrary to Pnma PuO2 and UO2 , the\nPnma ThO2 is relatively harder to be compressed along a axis compared to other two axes.\nAnd all three directional bulk moduli of Pnma ThO2 are apparently smaller than that of\nPnma PuO2 and UO2 , which indicates relative weaker covalency of ThO2 compared with\nPuO2 and UO2 in their high pressure phase.\n\n2.\n\nDebye temperature\n\nIn study of the sound velocities and Debye temperature, our calculated results of AFM\nPuO2 and AFM UO2 in their fluorite phase and high pressure cotunnite phase are presented\nin Table V. For comparison, results of NpO2 and ThO2 calculated by using the elastic data\nincluded in our previous studies [25, 32] are also listed. As seen from Table V, in their Fm3\u0304m\nstructure, Debye temperature and sound velocity of UO2 , NpO2 , and ThO2 are higher than\nthat of PuO2 . This is interestingly associated with the fact that Debye temperature (\u03b8D )\n\n15\n\n\fand Vickers hardness (H ) of materials follow an empirical relationship [42]:\n\u03b8D \u221d H1/2 \u03a91/6 M\u22121/2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere M is molar mass and \u03a9 is molecular volume. Although Fm3\u0304m PuO2 has close value\nof hardness compared with UO2 and NpO2 , it has relatively smaller molecular volume and\nlarger molar mass, as a consequence, has a lower Debye temperature than that of UO2 and\nNpO2 . As for the Pnma structure, Debye temperature and sound velocity of PuO2 , UO2 ,\nand ThO2 are lower than those of their Fm3\u0304m structure. This is since that the Pnma PuO2 ,\nUO2 , and ThO2 have smaller values of volume, bulk and shear moduli compared to their\nground-state Fm3\u0304m structure.\n\n3.\n\nHardness\n\nHardness is also one fundamental physical quantity when considering the phase stability and mechanical properties. According to the hardness conditions [43], the hardness is\nclosely related to interatomic distances, number of nearest neighbors, directional bonding,\nanisotropy, and the indenter orientation in the structures. To date there is still no available\ncalculation method involving hardness anisotropy in different dimensions in the literature. In\nspite of that, however, recently a semiempirical approach of hardness was raised by Simunek\nand Vackar [44, 45] in terms of the atomistic bond strength properties. This approach has\nbeen successfully tested by the authors on the more than 30 binary structures with zinc\nblende, cubic fluorite, rock salt crystals, and also for highly covalent crystals [44, 45]. There\nis no need for all those high-symmetry structures to consider the anisotropy. Also, this\nmethod has been applied to the crystals involving covalent and ionic bonding characters,\nsuch as in the compounds of transition metal and light atoms, and generalized to the complex structure with more than two different bond strengths [44, 45]. Moreover, in study of\ncovalent crystals, the results of the method raised by Simunek and Vackar [44, 45] agree well\nwith those of another hardness method of Gao and co-workers [46]. Therefore, the hardness\nof optimized cubic fluorite structures of actinide dioxides can be calculated by the method\nof Simunek and Vackar [44, 45]. In the case of two atoms 1 and 2 forming one bond of\nstrength s12 in a unit cell of volume \u03a9, the expression for hardness has the form [44]\nH = (C/\u03a9)b12 s12 e\u2212\u03c3f2 ,\n16\n\n(14)\n\n\fwhere\ns12 =\nand\n\np\n\n(e1 e2 )/(n1 n2 d12 ), ei = Zi /ri\n\n(15)\n\np\ne1 \u2212 e2 2\n) = 1 \u2212 [ (e1 e2 )/(e1 + e2 )]2\n(16)\ne1 + e2\nare the strength and ionicity of the chemical bond, respectively, and d12 is the interatomic\nf2 = (\n\ndistance; C =1550 and \u03c3=4 are constants. The radius ri is chosen to make sure that the\nsphere centered at atoms i in a crystal contains exactly the valence electronic charge Zi .\nFor fluorite structure PuO2 , b12 =32 counts the interatomic bonds between atoms Pu (1)\nand O (2) in the unit cell, n1 =8 and n2 =4 are coordination numbers of atom Pu and O,\nrespectively, r1 =1.698 (\u00c5) and r2 =1.005 (\u00c5) are the atomic radii for Pu and O atoms,\nrespectively, Z1 =16 and Z2 =6 are valence charge for Pu and O atoms, respectively, d12 =2.32\n(\u00c5) is the interatomic distance, and \u03a9=154.16 (\u00c53 ) is the volume of unit cell. As for\nfluorite UO2 , b12 =32, n1 =8, n2 =4, r1 =1.737 (\u00c5), r2 =1.003 (\u00c5), Z1 =14, Z2 =6, d12 =2.36 (\u00c5),\n\u03a9=161.82 (\u00c53 ). Using Eqs. (14)-(16), we obtain s12 =0.1010 and f2 =0.0503 for PuO2 and\ns12 =0.0919 and f2 =0.0219 for UO2 . Therefore, the hardness of PuO2 at its ground-state\nfluorite structure can be described as H =26.6 (GPa) and for UO2 H =25.8 (GPa). Clearly,\nthe hardness of PuO2 , almost equal to the hardness of NpO2 (26.5 GPa) [32], is slightly\nlarger than that of UO2 . Besides, these three values of hardness are all larger than that of\nThO2 (22.4 GPa) [25].\n\n4.\n\nTheoretical tensile strength\n\nAlthough many efforts have been paid on PuO2 , little is known on its theoretical tensile\nstrength. The ideal strength of materials is the stress that is required to force deformation\nor fracture at the elastic instability. Although the strength of a real crystal can be changed\nby the existing cracks, dislocations, grain boundaries, and other microstructural features, its\ntheoretical value can never be raised, i.e., the theoretical strength sets an upper bound on the\nattainable stress. Here, we employ a first-principles computational tensile test (FPCTT) [47]\nto calculate the stress-strain relationship and obtain the ideal tensile strength by deforming\nthe PuO2 crystals to failure. The anisotropy of the tensile strength is tested by pulling the\ninitial fluorite structure along the [001], [110], and [111] directions. As shown in Fig. 4,\nthree geometric structures are constructed to investigate the tensile strengthes in the three\n17\n\n\fFIG. 4: (Color online) Schematic illustration of tension along (a) [001], (b) [110], and (c) [111]\norientations.

In FPCTT, the tensile\ntotal\nwhere \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 is\nstress is calculated according to the Nielsen-Martin scheme [48] \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03a91 \u2202E\n\u2202 \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2\n\nthe strain tensor (\u03b1, \u03b2=1,2,3) and \u03a9 is the volume at the given tensile strain. Tensile process\nalong the [001], [110], and [111] directions is implemented by increasing the lattice constants\nalong these three orientations step by step. At each step, the structure is fully relaxed until\nall other five stress components vanished except that in the tensile direction.\nThe calculated total energy, stress, and spin moments as functions of uniaxial tensile\nstrain for AFM PuO2 in the [001], [110], and [111] directions are shown in Fig. 5. Clearly,\nall three energy-strain curves increase with increasing tensile strain, but one can easily find\nthe inflexions by performing differentiations. Actually, at strains of 0.36, 0.22, and 0.18,\n18\n\n\fTABLE VI: Calculated stress maxima and the corresponding strains in the tensile process.\nDirection\n\nStress (GPa)\n\nStrain\n\n[001]\n\n81.2\n\n0.36\n\n[110]\n\n28.3\n\n0.22\n\n[111]\n\n16.8\n\n0.18\n14\n\n8.0\n\n(a)\n\n5.5\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nO\n\n7.0\n\n6.5\n[001]\n[010]\n\n6.0\n\n[100]\n\n5.5\n\n5.0\n\n4.5\n\n[110]\n[-110]\n[001]\n\n4.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n10\n\n[111]\n[-1-12]\n[1-10]\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\n5.0\n0.0\n\nLattice parameters (A)\n\nLattice parameters (A)\n\nO\n\nO\n\nLattice parameters (A)\n\n12\n\n7.5\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nStrain\n\n0.3\nStrain\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nStrain\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Dependence of the lattice parameters on tensile strain for AFM PuO2 in\nthe (a) [001], (b) [110], and (c) [111] directions.\n\nthe stresses reach maxima 81.2, 28.3, and 16.8 GPa for pulling in the [001], [110], and [111]\ndirections, respectively. For clear comparison, all these maximum stresses (i.e., the theoretical tensile strengthes in the three typical crystalline orientations) and the corresponding\nstrains are listed in Table VI. Our results indicate that the [001] direction is the strongest\ntensile direction and [111] the weakest. In fact, there are eight Pu\u2212O bonds per formula\nunit for fluorite PuO2 . The angle of all eight bonds with respect to the pulling direction\nis 45\u25e6 in [001] direction. However, in [110] direction only four bonds make an angle of 45\u25e6\nwith the pulling direction. Four other bonds are vertical to the pulling direction. In [111]\ndirection, two bonds are parallel to the pulling direction and six others make an angle of\nabout 19.5\u25e6 with the pulling direction. The bonds vertical to the pulling direction have\nno contributions on the tensile strength and the bonds parallel to the pulling direction are\neasy to fracture under tensile deformation. Therefore, the fact that the tensile strength\nalong the [001] direction is stronger than that along other two directions is understandable.\nBesides, we note that the stress in [110] direction experiences an abrupt decrease process\nafter strain up to 0.24. This is due to the fact that the corresponding four Pu\u2212O bonds\n\n19\n\n\f(make an angle of 45\u25e6 with the pulling direction) have been pulled to fracture. The fracture\nbehaviors have been clarified by plotting valence electron charge density maps (not shown).\nUnder the same strain, the abrupt increase of spin moment can be clearly seen [Fig. 5(c)].\nWhile the spin moments in [110] and [111] directions only increase from 4.13 to 4.23 and\n4.33 \u03bcB , respectively, the spin moments in [001] direction increase up to 5.27 \u03bcB at the end\nof tensile deformation. In addition, the evolutions of the lattice parameters with strain in\nall three tensile processes are presented in Fig. 6. One can see from Fig. 6 that along with\nthe increase of the lattice parameter in the pulling direction, other two lattice parameters\nvertical to the pulling direction are decrease smoothly. In [001] direction, the evolutions\nof the lattice parameters along [100] and [010] directions are absolutely same due to the\nstructural symmetry. For all three tensile deformations, no structural transition has been\nobserved in our present FPCTT study.\n\nC.\n\nPhonon dispersion and thermodynamic properties of fluorite PuO2\n\nTo our knowledge, no experimental phonon frequency results have been published for\nPuO2 . In 2008, Yin and Savrasov [21] successfully obtained the phonon dispersions of both\nUO2 and PuO2 by employing the LDA+DMFT scheme. They found that the dispersive\nlongitudinal optical (LO) modes do not participate much in the heat transfer due to their\nlarge anharmonicity and only longitudinal acoustic (LA) modes having large phonon group\nvelocities are efficient heat carriers. In 2009, Minamoto et al. [49] investigated the thermodynamic properties of PuO2 based on their calculated phonon dispersion within the pure\nGGA scheme. In present work, we have calculated the Born effective charges Z \u2217 and dielectric constants \u03b5\u221e of PuO2 before phonon dispersion calculation due to their critical\nimportance to correct the LO-TO splitting. For fluorite PuO2 , the effective charge tensors\nfor both Pu and O are isotropic because of their position symmetry. After calculation, the\n\u2217\nBorn effective charges of Pu and O ions for AFM PuO2 are found to be ZPu\n=5.12 and\n\nZO\u2217 =\u22122.56, respectively, within LDA+U formalism with the choice of U=4.0 eV. In addition, the macroscopic static dielectric tensor is also isotropic and our computed value of\ndielectric constant \u03b5\u221e is 5.95 for the AFM phase. As for phonon dispersion, the HellmannFeynman theorem and the direct method [50] are employed to calculate the phonon curves\nalong \u0393\u2212X\u2212K\u2212\u0393\u2212L\u2212X\u2212W \u2212L directions in the BZ, together with the phonon density\n20\n\n\f20\nPDOS\n\nFrequency (THz)\n\n15\nPu\nO\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nX\n\nK\n\nL\n\nX\n\nW\n\nL\n\nFIG. 7: Phonon dispersion curves (left panel) and corresponding PDOS (right panel) for AFM\nPuO2 calculated within LDA+U formalism with U =4 eV.\n\nof states. We use 2\u00d72\u00d72 fcc supercell containing 96 atoms and 3\u00d73\u00d73 Monkhorst-Pack\nk -point mesh for the BZ integration. In order to calculate the Hellmann-Feynman forces,\nwe displace four atoms (two Pu and two O atoms) from their equilibrium positions and the\namplitude of all the displacements is 0.02 \u00c5.\nThe calculated phonon dispersion curves are displayed in Fig. 7 for the AFM phase of\nPuO2 . In the fluorite primitive cell, there are only three atoms (one Pu and two O atoms).\nTherefore, nine phonon modes exist in the dispersion relations. One can see that the LO-TO\nsplitting at \u0393 point becomes evident by the inclusion of polarization effects. In addition,\ndue to the fact that plutonium atom is heavier than oxygen atom, the vibration frequency of\nplutonium atom is lower than that of oxygen atom. As a consequence, the phonon density\nof states for PuO2 can be viewed as two parts. One is the part lower than 6.4 THz where the\nmain contribution comes from the plutonium sublattice, while the other part higher than\n6.4 THz are dominated by the dynamics of the light oxygen atoms.\nThermodynamic properties of AFM PuO2 calculated within LDA+U formalism with\nthe choice of U=4.0 eV are determined by phonon calculation using the quasiharmonic\napproximation [51], under which the Gibbs free energy G(T,P) is written as\nG(T, P ) = F (T, V ) + P V.\n\n(17)\n\nHere, F(T,V) is the Helmholtz free energy at temperature T and volume V and can be\nexpressed as\nF (T, V ) = E(V ) + Fph (T, V ) + Fel (T, V ),\n21\n\n(18)\n\n\f0\n\n-136\n\n-138\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFree energy (arb. units)\n\n-134\n\n1000\n\n-140\n\n-142\n\n1500\n\n5.25\n\n5.30\n\n5.35\n\n5.40\n\n5.45\n\n5.50\n\n5.55\n\n5.60\n\n5.65\n\nO\n\na (A)\n\nFIG. 8: Dependence of the free energy F(T,V) on crystal lattice parameter a for a number of\nselected temperatures for AFM PuO2 calculated within LDA+U formalism with U =4 eV.\n\nwhere E(V) is the ground-state total energy, Fph (T,V) is the phonon free energy and\nFel (T,V) is the thermal electronic contribution.

The temperature T appears\nin F (T, V ) via the phonon term only. Calculated free energy F (T, V ) curves of PuO2 for\ntemperature ranging from 0 up to 1500 K are shown in Fig. 8. The locus of the equilibrium\nlattice parameters at different temperature T are also presented. The equilibrium volume\nV(T) and the bulk modulus B(T) are obtained by EOS fitting. Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of the relative lattice parameter and the bulk modulus. Experimental\nresults [52] are also plotted. Clearly, the lattice parameter increases approximately in the\nsame ratio as that in experiment [52]. The bulk modulus B(T) is predicted to decrease\nalong with the increase of temperature.

A phase transition at\n24.3 GPa is predicted by the slope of the common tangent rule, as shown in the inset.\n\ncorresponding experimental data [53] below 300 K due to the intrinsic fact that near zero\ntemperature CP and CV approach to the same value. The disagreement of CP between\ntheory and experiments [54, 55] in high temperature domain is believed to mainly originate\nfrom the quasiharmonic approximation we use.\n\nD.\n\nHigh pressure behavior of PuO2\n\nIn the following, we will focus our attention on the behavior of plutonium dioxide under hydrostatic compression. Two experimentally established structures, Fm3\u0304m and Pnma\nphases, are investigated in detail. The relative energies (per unit cell) of the two phases\nat different volumes are calculated and shown in Fig. 11. Obviously, the Fm3\u0304m phase is\nstable under ambient pressure while under high pressure the Pnma phase becomes stable.\nAccording to the rule of common tangent of two energy curves, a phase transition at 24.3\nGPa is predicted by the slope shown in the inset of Fig. 11. Besides, we also determine the\nphase transition pressure by comparing the Gibbs free energy as a function of pressure. At\n0 K, the Gibbs free energy is equal to enthalpy H, expressed as H =E +PV. The crossing\nbetween the two enthalpy curves (not shown) also gives phase transition pressure of 24.3\nGPa, which is fully consistent with above result in terms of the common tangent rule.

We notice that Li et al [56] predicted a transition pressure of about 45 GPa employing the full-potential linear-muffin-tin-orbital (FPLMTO) method. However, they only\nconsidered the NM and FM phases in their calculations of the Fm3\u0304m and Pnma PuO2 . No\nresults were calculated for the AFM phase. In our present study, we first optimize the Pnma\nPuO2 at constant volume (about 125.2 \u00c53 ) of the experimental value at 39 GPa [8]. Our\ncalculated structural parameters of the NM, FM, and AFM phases are tabulated in Table\nVII. Obviously, the AFM phase is the most stable phase and its structural parameters are\nwell consistent with experiment. As seen in Table VII, results of AFM phase at 49 GPa is\nalso consistent with experiment. Therefore, we will only consider the results of AFM phase\nin the following discussion. In addition, obvious discrepancy between two works [8, 41] from\nthe same experimental group involving the transition pressure of ThO2 was noticed in our\nprevious study [25]. While the transition was reported firstly to start at 40 GPa [8], later,\nthrough improving experimental measurement technique, which can capture the two phases\ncohabitation zone during transition process, Idiri et al [41] observed that the transition really\nbegins around 33 GPa. Our previous study [25] predicted that the phase transition of ThO2\nstarted at around 26.5 GPa. Idiri et al [41] also stated that the bulk modulus of PuO2 were\nlargely overestimated in their previous work [8]. Thus, we believe that their former report\n[8] also overestimated the transition pressure of PuO2 in some degree. So the predicted\ntransition pressure of PuO2 , which is very close to that of ThO2 [25], is understandable.\n25\n\n\f6\nFm-3m phase\n\nO-2s\nO-2p\n\nPDOS\n\n4\n\nPu-6p\nPu-6d\n\n2\n\nPu-5f\n\n0\nPnma phase\n\nPDOS\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFIG. 12: (Color online) Partial density of states (PDOS) for (a) Fm3\u0304m phase and (b) Pnma phase\nat around 25 GPa. The Fermi energy level is zero. The energy gaps of Fm3\u0304m phase and Pnma\nphase are 1.51 eV and 1.65 eV, respectively.\n\nFigure 12 compares the PDOS of the Fm3\u0304m and Pnma phases of PuO2 at a pressure of\naround 25 GPa, close to the transition pressure. One can see evident increase of the band gap\nfrom 1.51 eV in the fluorite phase to 1.65 eV in the cotunnite phase. In study of UO2 , Geng\net al [24] also predicted this similar behavior. However, our previous study of ThO2 [25]\nfound that the band gap is reduced from Fm3\u0304m phase to Pnma phase. The reason is simply\nthat ThO2 is a charge-transfer insulator, while PuO2 and UO2 are the Mott-type insulators.\nFrom Fig 12, one can see that while O 2s and Pu 6p states expand in the low bands, O 2p and\nPu 5f /6d states are mainly featured near the Fermi level and have prominent hybridization\ncharacters in a width of 6.3 (5.9) eV for Fm3\u0304m (Pnma) phase. There is no evident difference\nbetween the two phases in their 5f electronic localization behavior. Therefore, our study of\nPuO2 supports our previous [25] viewpoint: the phenomenon of volume collapse during highpressure phase transition of the actinide dioxides is mainly attributed to the ionic (instead\nof electronic) response to the external compression.\nThe relative volume V/V0 evolution with pressure for PuO2 in both Fm3\u0304m and Pnma\nphases are shown in Fig 13. For comparison, the experimental [8] data are also shown in the\nfigure. Clearly, our calculated P-V equation of state is well consistent with the experimental\nmeasurement for the two phases of PuO2 . Specially, at the calculated transition pressure\n(24.3 GPa), our result in Fig. 13 gives that the volume collapse upon phase transition is\n\n26\n\n\f1.0\n\nFm-3m\n\nV/V=6.8%\n0.9\n\nPnma\n\n40 GPa\n\nRelative Volume V/V\n\n0\n\nFm-3m Expt.\nPnma Expt.\n\nV/V=6.2%\n0.8\n24.3 GPa\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\n200\n\n240\n\n280\n\nPressure (GPa)\n\nFIG. 13: (Color online) Calculated compression curves of PuO2 compared with experimental measurements.

The discrepancy between experiment and our calculation needs more experimental and\ntheoretical works to examine. After phase transition, we also find an isostructural transition\noccurring between 75 and 133 GPa for the Pnma phase.

The projected\nDOSs for the Pu 5f and O 2p orbitals are also shown. The Fermi energy level is set at zero.\n\nobserved in study of ThO2 [25]. The pressure dependence of the three lattice parameters\n(with respect to their values at calculated transition pressure 24.3 GPa) for the Pnma phase\nof PuO2 are plotted in Fig. 14. Similar to the studies of UO2 and ThO2 [24, 25], in\npressure region before 75 GPa, the responses of the three relative lattice parameters to the\ncompression are anisotropic in the sense that the compression of the middle axis a is most\nrapid compared to those of the long axis c and small axis b, which vary upon compression\nalmost in the same tendency. When the pressure becomes higher to be between 75 and\n133 GPa, remarkably, it reveals in Fig. 14 that all the three relative lattice parameters\nundergo dramatic variations by the fact that the small axis b has a strong rebound and the\nmiddle a is collapsed. When the pressure is beyond 133 GPa, then the variations of the\nthree relative lattice parameters become smooth and approach isotropic compression. This\nsignifies a typical isostructural transition for the Pnma phase of PuO2 .\nMoreover, we also present in Fig. 14 the evolution of the insulating band gap with\npressure for Pnma phase of PuO2 . Apparently, the band gap behaves smooth in pressure\nregion of 25-92 GPa, then turns to decrease suddenly from about 1.75 eV to zero under\ncompression from 92 to 133 GPa. This clearly indicates that the Pnma phase will occur\na metallic transition after external pressure exceeds 133 GPa. As Fig. 15(b) shows, with\n28\n\n\fincreasing pressure in the crossover range between 92 and 133 GPa, the 5f electrons in the\ncotunnite phase of PuO2 are more delocalized and the 5f bands are largely broadened. As\na result, the Mott-type band gap is narrowed and even blurred, which is characterized by\nfinite occupancies of O 2p and Pu 5f orbitals at the Fermi level, by the increasing kinetic\nenergy of 5f electrons. In order to see the pressure behavior of electronic structure with\ndifferent values of Hubbard parameter U for cotunnite PuO2 , we have plotted in Fig. 15\nthe total DOS and PDOS for the cotunnite PuO2 AFM phase calculated at 92, 133, and 248\nGPa within LDA+U formalism with U =0, 4, and 6 eV. It clearly shows that (i) the pure\nLDA always produces incorrect electronic structure in the full pressure region we considered,\nand (ii) it is not imperative to adjust U as varying pressure by the fact revealed in Figs.\n15(b) and 15(c) that the electronic properties and insulator-metal transition behavior at\nhigh pressures show the similar character for the two choices of Hubbard parameter U=4\neV and U=6 eV. Based on this observation, in the above high-pressure calculations we have\nfixed the value of U to be 4 eV. It should be stressed that the metallic transition is not\nunique for PuO2 . Similar phenomenon has also been observed in other actinide dioxides\n[24]. Besides, the variation of the local magnetic moment of plutonium atoms is almost\nsame for Fm3\u0304m and Pnma phases, implying that the magnetic property is insensitive to\nthe structure transition in PuO2 . Actually, the calculated amplitude of local spin moment\nvaries from \u223c4.1 to \u223c3.8 \u03bcB (per Pu atom) for both fluorite and cotunnite phases in pressure\nrange from 0 to 255 GPa. No paramagnetic transition for this material has been observed\nin present study.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, the ground state properties as well as the high pressure behavior of PuO2\nwere studied by means of the first-principles DFT+U method. By choosing the Hubbard\nU parameter around 4 eV within the LDA+U approach, the electronic structure, lattice\nparameters, and bulk modulus were calculated for both the ambient Fm3\u0304m and the highpressure Pnma phases of PuO2 and were shown to accord well with experiments. Results for\nUO2 were also presented for comparison. Based on these results, the Pu\u2212O and U\u2212O bonds\nwere interpreted as displaying a mixed ionic/covalent character by electronic structure analysis. After comparing with our previous calculations of NpO2 and ThO2 , we demonstrated\n29\n\n\fthat the Pu\u2212O, U\u2212O, and Np\u2212O bonds have stronger covalency than the Th\u2212O bond.\nThe ionicity of Th\u2212O bond was found to be the largest among these four kinds of actinide\ndioxides. In addition, the stability of the two phases at zero pressure was predicted through\ncalculating elastic constants and phonon dispersion. The hardness, Debye temperature, ideal\ntensile strength, and thermodynamic properties were calculated and analyzed to support the\npractical application of PuO2 . We showed that the hardness of Fm3\u0304m phase is \u223c27 GPa\nand the Debye temperatures of Fm3\u0304m and Pnma phases are 354.5 and 350.0 K, respectively.\nFor Fm3\u0304m PuO2 , the ideal tensile strengths are calculated within FPCTT to be 81.2, 28.3,\nand 16.8 GPa in tensile deformations along the [100], [110], and [111] directions, respectively. The volume thermal expansion and specific heat at constant volume curves are well\nconsistent with available experiments. However, the discrepancy between measured and our\ncalculated specific heat at constant pressure in high temperature domain is evident. This\nneeds further theoretical work by including the anharmonic ionic contribution to decrease\nthis kind of discrepancy.\nIn studying the pressure behavior of PuO2 , we showed that the Fm3\u0304m\u2192Pnma transition\noccurs at 24.3 GPa. Although this value is large smaller than the experimental report, we\nbelieve that our calculated result is reasonable. One reason is that the lattice parameters of\nPnma PuO2 AFM phase calculated at around 39 and 49 GPa are precisely consistent with\nexperiment. Another is the fact that the experiment needs improvement as having been\nindicated in study of UO2 and ThO2 [41]. Furthermore, we extended the pressure up to\n280 GPa for the two structures of PuO2 . A metallic transition at around 133 GPa and an\nisostructural transition in pressure range of 75-133 GPa were predicted for the Pnma phase.\nAlso, the calculated amplitude of local spin moment only varies from \u223c4.1 to \u223c3.8 \u03bcB (per\nPu atom) for both fluorite and cotunnite phases in pressure range from 0 to 255 GPa. No\nparamagnetic transition for this material has been observed.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully thank G. H. Lu, H. B. Zhou, and X. C. Li for illustrating discussion on\nFPCTT.
