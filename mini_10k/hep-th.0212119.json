Usually,\nH is identified with a subgroup of G and in forming the coset one employs the adjoint\naction for which H acts symmetrically from the left and from the right. Such symmetric\ntransformations always possess fixed points (e.g. the group unit). These lead to all kinds\nof singularities of the resulting coset geometry, including boundaries and corners.\nIt is possible, however, to work with an enlarged class of exactly solvable cosets and\nthis is the theme of the following note. The idea is to admit different left and right\nactions of H on G. Even though conformal invariance imposes strong constraints on\nasymmetric quotients G/H, one gains a lot of freedom in model building. Some of the\ninteresting new theories possess smooth background geometries. One such example is\nprovided by the five-dimensional base SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)/U(1) of the conifold. Other models\nhave isolated singularities such as the big-bang singularity in the four-dimensional NappiWitten geometry SU(2) \u00d7 SL(2, R)/R \u00d7 R.\n\nIn spite of these interesting features, asymmetric cosets have not been studied very\nsystematically in the past. One reason for this is that they are typically heterotic, i.e. they\npossess different left and right chiral algebras. Among the few publications which deal\nwith special cases of asymmetric cosets one may find two early publications by Guadagnini\net al. [1, 2]. The models which are studied in these papers can be applied to the base of\nthe conifold as was pointed out some years ago by Pando-Zayas and Tseytlin [3]. Actions\nfor a wider class of asymmetrically gauged WZNW models were written down in [4]. We\nshall recall below that they are relevant for Nappi-Witten type models [5]. The latter\nhave been employed recently to investigate string theory in time-dependent backgrounds\nwith big-bang singularities [6]. Branes in asymmetrically gauged WZNW models were\nalso studied in [7] but our analysis will give boundary theories with a different geometric\ninterpretation.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In the next section we shall present a comprehensive discussion of the bulk theory and, in particular, spell out an expression for its\nmodular invariant partition function. The third section is then devoted to the construction of boundary states for asymmetric cosets. We will also identify the subspaces along\nwhich the corresponding branes are localized. All these results on boundary conditions\nin asymmetric coset theories are based on our earlier work [8, 9]. In the final section we\nillustrate the general theory through some important examples. These include the base\nof the conifold and the Nappi-Witten type coset background.\nNote added: While we were preparing this publication, G. Sarkissian issued a paper\nthat has partial overlap with section 4 below [10].\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe bulk theory\n\nIn this first subsection we are going to describe the bulk geometry of asymmetric cosets.\nWe will start with a detailed formulation of the general setup and of the conditions that\nconformal invariance imposes on the basic data. The origin of the latter can be explained\nwith the help of the classical actions which we shall briefly recall in the second subsection.\nWe then provide expressions for the bulk partition functions and establish their modular\ninvariance. Finally, we present some examples showing the wide applicability of asymmetric cosets. In an appendix to this section we correct some earlier results of Guadagnini\net al. [1, 2].\n\n2.1\n\nThe geometry of asymmetric cosets\n\nTwo groups G and H enter the construction of a coset G/H. Both of them are assumed\nto be reductive so that they split into a product of simple groups and U(1) factors. Let\nthe number of these factors be n and r, respectively, i.e. we take G and H to be of the\nform G = G1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Gn and H = H1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hr . Furthermore, to each factor Gi in the\ndecomposition of G we assign a level ki . It is convenient to combine the set of all these\nlevels into a vector k = (k1 , * * * , kn ).\n\nAlong with the two groups G and H we need to specify an action of H on G. We take\nthe latter to be of the form g 7\u2192 \u01ebL (h)g\u01ebR (h\u22121 ) where \u01ebL/R : H \u2192 G denote two group\nhomomorphisms which descend to embeddings of the corresponding Lie algebras. In the\nusual coset theories \u01ebL and \u01ebR are the same. An asymmetry in the coset construction\narises when we drop this condition and allow for two different maps.\nThe coset space G/H consists of orbits under the action of H on G, i.e.\nG/H = G/[ g \u223c \u01ebL (h)g\u01ebR (h\u22121 ) ; h \u2208 H ] .\nTo be precise, we should display the dependence on the choice of \u01ebL/R . But since we\nconsider these maps to be fixed once and for all, we decided to suppress them from our\nsymbol G/H for the coset space. Let us stress, however, that the geometry is very sensitive\nto the choice of \u01ebL/R . We will see this in the examples later on.\nThe basic data we have introduced so far, i.e. the two groups G, H, the vector k of\nlevels and the maps \u01ebL , \u01ebR , will enter the construction of two-dimensional models with\ntarget space G/H. To ensure conformal invariance, however, these data have to obey one\nimportant constraint which we can formulate using the notion of an \"embedding index\"\nx\u01eb \u2208Mat(n \u00d7 r) for the homomorphism \u01eb : H \u2192 G. To define x\u01eb we split \u01eb into a matrix\nof homomorphisms \u01ebsi : Hs \u0592\u2192 Gi where s = 1, . . . , r, and i = 1, . . . , n, run through the\nfactors of H and G, respectively. The embedding index x\u01eb = x = (xsi ) is a matrix with\n3\n\n\felements of the form1\nsi\n\nx\n\n\b\nTri \u01ebsi (X) \u01ebsi (Y )\n\b\n=\nTrs X Y\n\nfor\n\nX, Y \u2208 hs \\{0} .\n\n(1)\n\nObserve that the number that is computed by the expression on the right hand side does\nnot depend on the choice of the elements X, Y . Let us also note that the map \u01ebsi is\nallowed to map Hs onto the unit element in Gi for some choices of i and s. In this case,\nthe corresponding matrix element xsi vanishes.\nLet us now consider the embedding indices xL and xR for the two homomorphisms\n\u01ebL and \u01ebR . A conformal theory with target space G/H exists for our choice of levels k,\nprovided that the latter obey the following constraint2\nxL k = xR k .\n\n(2)\n\nIn other words, the vector of levels must lie in the kernel of xL \u2212 xR . For symmetric cosets\nthis condition is trivially satisfied with any choice of k. Asymmetric cosets, however,\nconstrain the admissible levels.\n\n2.2\n\nThe classical action\n\nUsing the basic data we have introduced in the previous subsection we can write down\nthe classical action of a gauged WZNW model. As usual, this consists of several pieces.\nTo begin with, there is the WZNW action for the numerator group G,\nG\nSWZNW\n\ng|k\n\n\u0001\n\n=\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nGi\nSWZNW\n(gi |ki )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere g = g1 * * * * * gn . This action is a sum over the WZNW actions for the individual\ngroups Gi without any interaction terms. These building blocks are given by\nZ\n\b\nki\nGi\n \u0304 i g \u22121 + S Gi (gi |ki ) .\nSWZNW (gi |ki ) = \u2212\nd2z Tri \u2202gi gi\u22121 \u2202g\ni\nWZ\n4\u03c0 \u03a3\n\nThe Wess-Zumino terms are defined as usual in terms of the Wess-Zumino three-forms\n\u03c9iWZ . Consistency of the associated quantum theories enforces quantization constraints on\nthe levels ki . For simply-connected simple constituents Gi the level ki has to be an integer.\nFor the U(1) part and non-simply-connected groups the constraints will be different.\nThe action functional (3) is invariant under the \"global\" transformations of the form\ng(z, z\u0304) 7\u2192 gL (z) g(z, z\u0304) gR\u22121(z\u0304) where gL (z) and gR (z\u0304) are arbitrary (anti-) holomorphic\n1\n\nWe use a normalized trace Tr = 2 tr/I. Here, we denoted by tr the matrix trace and by I the Dynkin\nindex of the corresponding representation. We use the conventions of [11, pages 58 and 84].\n2\nIf there are two or more identical groups, this equation has to hold up to a possible relabeling of\nthese groups on one side.\n\n4\n\n\fG-valued functions. Our subgroup H along with the two homomorphisms \u01ebL/R can be\nused to gauge some part of this WZNW symmetry. To this end we consider the model\nS G/H g, A, \u0100 k, \u01ebL/R\n\n\u0001\n\n=\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nGi\nSWZNW\n(gi |ki ) +\n\nn X\nr\nX\ni=1 s=1\n\nG /Hs\n\nSinti\n\ngi , As , \u0100s ki , \u01ebsi\nL/R\n\n\u0001\n\n. (4)\n\nHere, the building blocks of the second term are given by [4]\nG /H\nSinti s\n\ngi , As , \u0100s ki , \u01ebsi\nL/R\n\n\u0001\n\nki\n=\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\n\b\n \u0304 i\nd2z Tri 2 \u01ebL (\u0100s ) \u2202gi gi\u22121 \u2212 2 \u01ebR (As ) gi\u22121\u2202g\n\n+ 2 \u01ebL (\u0100s ) gi \u01ebR (As ) gi\u22121 \u2212 \u01ebL (\u0100s ) \u01ebL (As ) \u2212 \u01ebR (\u0100s ) \u01ebR (As )\n\n. (5)\n\nIn this formula we omitted the superscripts si on \u01ebL/R . The gauge fields As , \u0100s take\nvalues in the Lie algebra hs . It is not difficult to check that the full action (4) is invariant\nunder the following set of infinitesimal gauge transformations\n \u0304 s + i [\u03c9s , \u0100s ] ,\n\u03b4As = i \u2202\u03c9s + i [\u03c9s , As ] , \u03b4 \u0100s = i \u2202\u03c9\n\u03b4gi = i \u01ebL (\u03c9s )gi \u2212 i gi \u01ebR (\u03c9s )\n\nfor \u03c9s = \u03c9s (z, z\u0304)\n\nprovided that the levels ki obey the constraint (2). In fact, under gauge transformations\nthe action behaves according to\n\u03b4S\n\nG/H\n\nZ\nr\nn X\nX\n\b\nki\nsi\nsi\nsi\nd2z Tri \u01ebsi\n(g|k, \u01ebL/R ) =\nL (\u0100s ) \u2202\u01ebL (\u03c9s ) \u2212 \u01ebR (\u0100s ) \u2202\u01ebR (\u03c9s )\n4\u03c0\n\u03a3\ni=1 s=1\n\nsi\n \u0304 si\n \u0304 si\n+ \u01ebsi\nR (As ) \u2202\u01ebR (\u03c9s ) \u2212 \u2202\u01ebL (\u03c9s ) \u01ebL (As )\n\nand so it vanishes whenever eq. (2) holds true. We have therefore shown that the data\nintroduced above indeed label different two-dimensional conformal field theories.\n\n2.3\n\nExact solution: modular invariant partition function\n\nOur aim now is to present a few elements of the exact solution. We shall begin with some\nremarks on the relevant chiral algebras and then address the construction of the modular\ninvariant partition function for our asymmetric coset theories.\nIn the following let us denote the chiral algebra of the WZNW model for the group\nG and levels ki by A(G). This algebra is generated by a sum of affine Lie algebras\nwith levels ki , one for each factor in the decomposition of the reductive group G. The\ntwo maps \u01ebL/R give rise to two embeddings of the chiral algebra A(H) into A(G). Let\nus note that A(H) is generated by a sum of affine algebras, one for each factor in the\nproduct H = H1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hr . The levels of these affine algebras form a vector (ks\u2032 )s=1,...,r\nwhose entries are related to the levels of A(G) by k \u2032 = xL/R k (matrix notation). Our\n5\n\n\fassumption (2) means that \u01ebL/R give rise to two (possibly different) embeddings of the\nsame chiral algebra A(H) into A(G). Given these embeddings, we employ the usual GKO\nconstruction to obtain two coset algebras A = A(G/H, \u01ebL ) and \u0100 = A(G/H, \u01ebR ) which\nform the left and right chiral algebras of the asymmetric coset model. Note that these\ntwo chiral algebras can be different if the two maps \u01ebL and \u01ebR are not the same. In this\nsense, asymmetric coset models of the kind that we consider in this note are heterotic\nconformal field theories.\nThe state space of any conformal field theory decomposes into representations of the\nchiral algebra. Our task here is to find a combination of these representations which\ndoes not only reflect the geometry of the target space G/H but is at the same time also\nconsistent from a conformal field theory point of view. The second requirement means\nthat the vacuum must be unique and that the partition function is modular invariant.\nThe first condition, namely the relation of our exact solution to the space G/H, implies\nthat in the limit of large levels k the space of ground states has to reproduce the space of\nfunctions on G/H. Actually, we can turn this around for a moment and use the harmonic\nanalysis of G/H to get some ideas about the structure of the state space. To this end, let\nus recall that the algebra F (G) of functions on G may be considered as a G \u00d7 G-module\nunder left and right regular action. The Peter-Weyl theorem states that this module\ndecomposes into irreducibles according to\nM\nF (G) =\nV\u03bc \u2297 V\u03bc+ ,\n\nwhere \u03bc+ is the conjugate of \u03bc. Since we want to divide G by the action of H it is\nconvenient to decompose the space of function on G into representations of H. The space\nof function on G/H is then obtained as the H-invariant part of F (G). We easily find\nM\nV\u03bc \u2297 V\u03bc+\nF (G) \u223c\n=\nM\n+\n\u223c\n(bL )\u03bc a (bR )\u03bc+ c Va \u2297 Vc+\n(6)\n=\nM\n+\n\u223c\n(bL )\u03bc a (bR )\u03bc+ c Nac+ d Vd .\n=\n\nThe symbols bL/R denote the branching coefficients of the inclusion \u01ebL/R (H) \u0592\u2192 G. The\ntensor product coefficients Nac+ d for the decomposition of the tensor product of representations of H enter when we restrict the action of H \u00d7H to its diagonal subgroup H = HD .\nTaking the invariant part of (6) corresponds to putting d = 0 or, equivalently, a = c and\nhence we have shown that\nM\n\u0001\n+\nF (G/H) = InvHD F (G) \u223c\n(bL )\u03bc a (bR )\u03bc+ a .\n=\nThis is the space that we want to reproduce from the ground states of our exact solution\nwhen we send the levels to infinity. With a bit of experience in coset chiral algebras and\n6\n\n\ftheir representation theory it is not too difficult to come up with a good proposal for the\nconformal field theory state space that meets this requirement.\nG/H\n\nThe rough idea is to replace the branching coefficients b\u03bc a by coset sectors H(\u03bc,a) . But\nthis rule is a bit too simple and has to be refined in several directions. To build in all the\nadditional subtleties, we need a bit of preparation. For simplicity we consider the sector\nof the left moving chiral algebra only.\nIn the following we label sectors of A(G) by \u03bc, \u03bd, . . . , and we use the letters a, b, . . . ,\nfor sectors of A(H). Let us recall that the two sets of sectors admit an action of the\ngroup centers Z(G) and Z(H), respectively. This action may be diagonalized by the\ncorresponding modular S-matrices,\nG\n2\u03c0i QJ (\u03bd) G\nSJ\u03bc\nS\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bd = e\n\nfor J \u2208 Z(G)\n\nwhere QJ (\u03bd) = hJ + h\u03bc \u2212 hJ\u03bc are the so-called monodromy charges. An analogous\nstatement holds for the action of the center Z(H). In a coset sector (\u03bc, a) the labels \u03bc, a\nform an entity and as such they have to transform identically under the common center\n\b\nGid (L) = (J, J \u2032 ) \u2208 Z(G) \u00d7 Z(H) J = \u01ebL (J \u2032 ) .\nNot all the labels (\u03bc, a) fulfill this requirement. What remains is the set\n\b\nAll(G/H)L = (\u03bc, a) QJ (\u03bc) = QJ \u2032 (a) for all (J, J \u2032 ) \u2208 Gid (L)\n\nof allowed coset labels. It turns out that elements in the set All(G/H)L which are related\nby the action of Gid correspond to the same coset sector. The set of sectors for the coset\n\u000e\nchiral algebra is therefore given by Rep(G/H)L = All(G/H)L Gid (L). This observation\nmotivates the term \"field identification group\" for the common center Gid (L). The same\nconstructions can be performed for the right chiral algebra. But note that in general the\nresulting expressions will not coincide.\nHaving introduced all these notions from the representation theory of coset chiral\nalgebras we are finally able to spell out our proposal for the state space,\nM\n(G/H)\n(G/H)\n(7)\nHG/H =\nH(\u03bc,a) L \u2297 H\u0304(\u03bc,a)+ R .\n[\u03bc,a]\u2208Rep(G/H)\n\nwhere the set Rep(G/H) is defined by\n.\nRep(G/H) = All(G/H) Gid\n\nwith\n(8)\n\nAll(G/H) = All(G/H)L \u2229 All(G/H)R , Gid = Gid (L) \u2229 Gid (R) .\n\nNote that the field identification group Gid admits a natural interpretation as the stabilizer\nof the action g 7\u2192 \u01ebL (h)g\u01ebR (h)\u22121 , i.e.\n\b\n\u0001\nGid =\nJ, J \u2032 J \u2032 \u2208 Z(H), J = \u01ebL (J \u2032 ) = \u01ebR (J \u2032 ) \u2208 Z(G) .\n7\n\n\fIn writing our formula (7) we implicitly assumed that the action of the field identification\ngroup Gid on All(G/H) possesses no fixed points, i.e. that all orbits [\u03bc, a] have the same\nlength. It should be stressed that fixed points for the action of Gid (L/R) on All(G/H)L/R\nare not ruled out by this assumption.\nAs we mentioned before, our proposal (7) for the state space has to pass a number\nof tests before we can accept it as a candidate for the state space of our conformal field\ntheory. From our discussion above it is not difficult to see that at large level, the space\nof ground states coincides with the space of functions on G/H. Moreover, taking the\nquotient with respect to Gid in eq. (8) ensures that there is a unique vacuum in HG/H .\nHence, it only remains to demonstrate that our Ansatz also leads to a modular invariant\npartition function. To this end it is convenient to write the partition function in the form\nZ(q, q\u0304) =\n\n1 X G/H\nG/H\n(G/H)\n(G/H)\nPL (\u03bc, a) PR (\u03bc+ , a+ ) \u03c7(\u03bc,a) L (q)\u03c7\u0304(\u03bc,a)+ R (q\u0304) .\n|Gid | \u03bc,a\n\nThe factor 1/|Gid| in front of this expression removes a common factor from the whole\nexpression in such a way that the vacuum characters possess a trivial prefactor. The\nsummation in the previous expression runs over all labels \u03bc and a and we enforce the\nrestriction to the allowed coset labels by inserting the projectors\nG/H\n\nPL/R (\u03bc, a) =\n\n1\n|Gid (L/R)|\n\nX\n\ne2\u03c0i(QJ (\u03bc)\u2212QJ \u2032 (a)) .\n\n(J,J \u2032 )\u2208Gid (L/R)\n\nIt is now rather straightforward to compute how this partition function behaves under\nthe modular transformation S that replaces q = exp(2\u03c0i\u03c4 ) by q\u0303 = exp(\u22122\u03c0i/\u03c4 ),\nG/H\n\nSZ(q, q\u0304) =\n\nX\n\nPL\n\n\u03bc,a,\u03bd,\u03bb,b,c\n\nG/H\n\n(\u03bc, a) PR (\u03bc+ , a+ ) G H G\n(G/H)\n(G/H)\nS\u03bc\u03bd S\u0304ab S\u0304\u03bc+ \u03bb+ SaH+ c+ \u03c7(\u03bd,b) L (q)\u03c7\u0304(\u03bb,c)+ R (q\u0304) .\n|Gid |\n\nWe would like to use unitarity of the S-matrices to simplify this expression. But before\nwe can do so, we have to get rid of the projectors. To this end we insert the explicit\nformulas for the projectors in terms of monodromy charges and then pull the latter into\nthe S-matrices by shifting their indices with the action of simple currents. This gives\nSZ(q, q\u0304) =\n\n1\n|Gid | * |Gid (L)| * |Gid (R)|\n\nX\n\nX\n\n(J1 ,J1\u2032 ),(J2 ,J2\u2032 ) \u03bc,a,\u03bd,\u03bb,b,c\n(G/H)L\n\nG\nS\u03bcJ\nS\u0304 H \u2032 S\u0304 G+ + SaH+ J2\u2032 c+ \u03c7(\u03bd,b)\n1 \u03bd aJ1 b \u03bc J2 \u03bb\n\n(G/H)\n\n(q)\u03c7\u0304(\u03bb,c)+ R (q\u0304) .\n\nNow we are able to perform the sum over \u03bc and a to obtain\nSZ(q, q\u0304) =\n\n1\n|Gid | * |Gid(L)| * |Gid (R)|\n\nX\n\nX\n\n(J1 ,J1\u2032 ),(J2 ,J2\u2032 ) \u03bd,\u03bb,b,c\n\n8\n\nJ \u22121 \u03bb J \u2032 b\n\n(G/H)L\n\n\u03b4J12\u03bd \u03b4J 1\u2032\u22121 c \u03c7(\u03bd,b)\n2\n\n(G/H)\n\n(q)\u03c7\u0304(\u03bb,c)+ R (q\u0304) .\n\n\fAt this stage we may resum the label. Then we see that part of the prefactor cancels and\nwe are left with\n1 X (G/H)L\n(G/H)\nSZ(q, q\u0304) =\n\u03c7(\u03bd,b) (q)\u03c7\u0304(\u03bd,b)+ R (q\u0304) .\n|Gid |\n\u03bd,b\n\nThis is exactly the behavior modular invariance requires from our partition function. Note\nthat the restriction to allowed coset labels is implicitly contained in the previous expression\nsince coset characters vanish if the relevant branching selection rule is not satisfied. It\nis obvious that our partition function is also invariant under modular T -transformations\nwhich send \u03c4 to \u03c4 + 1.\n\n2.4\n\nSpecial cases and examples\n\nOur general construction includes a number of interesting special cases. The most familiar\nexamples are the Nappi-Witten background [5] and the T pq -spaces [3]. Both of them\nbelong to a distinguished class of asymmetric cosets for which we introduce the notion\nof \"generalized automorphism type\". In the last subsection we will briefly discuss one\nexample of an asymmetric coset that is not of this type.\n2.4.1\n\nAsymmetric cosets from automorphisms\n\nThe simplest setup for asymmetric cosets that one can imagine is one in which the left\nand right embeddings are related by automorphisms. More precisely, we are thinking of\nsituations in which the left homomorphism \u01ebL = \u01eb is related to \u01ebR = \u03a9\u22121\nG \u25e6 \u01eb \u25e6 \u03a9H by\ncomposition with two automorphisms \u03a9G and \u03a9H of G and H, respectively. Let us notice\nthat the concatenation of an embedding with an automorphism gives another embedding\nwith the same embedding index.3 This observation guarantees the validity of the anomaly\ncancellation condition (2).\nFor the explicit construction of the state space (7) we have to know the centers\n\u0001\nGid (L) and Gid (R) in detail. Note that every element \u01eb(J \u2032 ), J \u2032 \u2208 Gid (L) is mapped\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nto an element \u03a9\u22121\nG \u25e6 \u01eb(J ), \u03a9H (J ) = \u03a9G \u25e6 \u01eb \u25e6 \u03a9H (\u03a9H (J )), \u03a9H (J ) \u2208 Gid (R) by\nthe action of the pair (\u03a9\u22121\n, \u03a9\u22121\nG \u0001\nH ). The right center is thus the image of the left center,\n\u22121\n\u22121\nGid (R) = (\u03a9G , \u03a9H ) Gid (L) , and the common center is the intersection of these two sets.\n\u0001\n\u22121\nSimilarly the allowed coset labels are related by All(G/H)R = (\u03a9\u22121\nAll(G/H)L .\nG , \u03a9H ) \u0001\nTo prove this statement one employs the invariance property Q\u03a9G (J) \u03a9G (\u03bc) = QJ (\u03bc) of\nthe monodromy charges and the analogous statement for the subgroup H.\nThese observations enable us to find a rather explicit expression for the state space.\nIn our example the general formula (7) can be simplified due to the fact that left and\n3\n\nIn our terminology, automorphisms do not only have to respect the group multiplication but also the\nKilling form (or an other invariant form in terms of which the model is defined).\n\n9\n\n\fright moving chiral algebra are isomorphic. We will therefore express the state space in\nterms of quantities of the left chiral algebra. All we need to do is to replace the coset\n(G/H)\n(G/H)L\nrepresentations H(\u03bc,a) R through H(\u03a9G (\u03bc),\u03a9\n. By construction, the latter is non-trivial\nH (a))\nif and only if the first one was. We can also express the action of the common center on\nthese labels. If we combine these facts we finally arrive at\nM\n(G/H)\n(G/H)L\n.\nHG/H =\nH(\u03bc,a) L \u2297 H\u0304(\u03a9G (\u03bc),\u03a9\n+\nH (a))\n[\u03bc,a]\u2208Rep(G/H)\n\nLet us emphasize once more that the coset sectors are both defined with respect to the\nsame embedding \u01eb in this expression. The asymmetry enters in the explicit appearance\nof the twists of labels and in an (implicit) reduction of labels over which we sum.\nThe most prominent example of asymmetric cosets of the type considered in this\nsubsection is provided by the Nappi-Witten background [5]. It is obtained as a coset\nof the product group G = SL(2, R) \u00d7 SU(2) with respect to some abelian subgroup\nH = R \u00d7 R. In this case, the automorphism \u03a9G is trivial while \u03a9H exchanges the two\nfactors of R. The model will be discussed in detail in section 4.\n2.4.2\n\nExamples of GMM-type\n\nLet us now consider a slightly more complicated family of examples in which the numerator\ngroup is a product G1 \u00d7 G2 of two groups G1 and G2 which possess a common subgroup\nH. Our aim is to describe the coset G1 \u00d7 G2 /H where the first homomorphism \u01ebL = e \u00d7 \u01eb2\nembeds H into the group G2 and \u01ebR = \u01eb1 \u00d7e sends elements of H into G1 . The Lagrangian\ndescription of such models was developed by Guadagnini, Martellini and Mintchev (GMM)\nmore than fifteen years ago [1, 2]. In appendix A we show how their results can be\nrecovered from the more general expression (4). We also use the opportunity to correct\nsome statements of GMM concerning the current algebra relations and the validity of the\naffine Sugawara / coset construction for this type of coset models.\nThe Lagrangian treatment of appendix A and algebraic intuition lets us suspect that\nthe coset model is manifestly heterotic with chiral algebras given by\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\u0011\n\u0001\nA (G1 )k1 \u2297 (G2 )k2 /Hk \u2297 A (G1 )k1 /Hk \u2297 (G2 )k2 .\nOne can easily see that the field identification group for the coset G1 \u00d7 G2 /H is given by\n\b\nGid = (0, 0, J \u2032) (0, J \u2032 ) \u2208 Gid (G1 /H) \u2229 Gid (G2 /H) .\n\nThe allowed coset labels consist of triples (\u03bc, \u03b1, a) such that (\u03bc, a) and (\u03b1, a) are allowed\nfor the G1 /H and G2 /H cosets, respectively. Coset representations are then obtained by\ndividing out the field identifications Gid . The resulting state space simply reads\nM\nG2 /H\nG1 /H\nG2\nH =\nH\u03bcG1 \u2297 H(\u03b1,a)\n\u2297 H\u0304(\u03bc,a)\n+ \u2297 H\u0304\u03b1+ .\n[\u03bc,\u03b1,a]\u2208Rep(G/H)\n\n10\n\n\fIt reflects the fact that in both the left and the right moving algebra one still finds a\nresidual current symmetry.\nFor the physical applications we are particularly interested in a special choice of product group and subgroup, G1 = G2 = SU(2) and H = U(1). Under these circumstances\nthe GMM-model describes five-dimensional non-Einstein T pq spaces [3]. The special case\np = q = 1 admits a direct interpretation as the base of the conifold (see, e.g., [12]). This\nexample will be discussed in detail in section 4.\n2.4.3\n\nAsymmetric cosets of non-automorphism type\n\nIn the last two subsections we discussed examples of asymmetric cosets which are of\nrather special form. Recall that for the first case, the left and right embeddings were\nsimply related by automorphisms. An interesting generalization of this setup involves\nchoosing a chain of subgroups H = U1 \u2282 U2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 UN = G along with left and right\nembeddings which are pairwise related through automorphisms. If an asymmetric coset\nfalls into this wider class, we will say that it is of \"generalized automorphism type\". Note\nthat the GMM coset models belong to this family. To see how this works, let us introduce\na subgroup U2 = H \u00d7 H which sits in between H and G = G1 \u00d7 G2 . Given such an\nintermediate group we first embed H into either the second or first factor of H \u00d7 H and\nthen continue by embedding H \u00d7H into G. In this scenario, the left and right embeddings\nfrom H to H \u00d7 H are related by the permutation automorphism of H \u00d7 H and the left\nand right embedding from H \u00d7 H to G are even identical.\nAsymmetric coset models of generalized automorphism type are heterotic with respect\nto their maximal chiral algebras, i.e. the algebra of holomorphic chiral fields is not isomorphic to the algebra of anti-holomorphic fields (unless the model is of automorphism type).\nOn the other hand, their chiral algebras possess a smaller common chiral subalgebra for\nwhich the whole theory is still rational. This property will enable us in the next section\nto write down a large number of boundary states for asymmetric cosets of generalized\nautomorphism type.\n\nBefore we proceed to the discussion of boundary conditions, however, we would like\nto provide at least one example of an asymmetric coset that is not of generalized automorphism type. To this end we consider once again the product G = G1 \u00d7 G2\nof two simple Lie groups Gi which possess a common subgroup H. One can define\nan action of H on G which is based on the embeddings of the following special form\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u01ebL (h) = \u01eb1 (h), \u01eb2 (h) and \u01ebR (h) = \u01eb\u20321 (h), id . The corresponding matrices of embedding\nindices are denoted by (x1 , x2 ) and (x\u20321 , 0). If we can now find levels such that the condition k = x1 k1 + x2 k2 = x\u20321 k1 is obeyed, then there exists an associated asymmetric coset\n\n11\n\n\fmodel with chiral algebra\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u0001\nA (G1 )k1 \u00d7 (G2 )k2 /Hk \u2297 A (G1 )k1 /Hk \u00d7 (G2 )k2 .\n\nFor models of this type we were not able to find a common chiral subalgebra for which the\ntheory stays rational. An very explicit example is obtained using the inclusion su(2)4k\u2032 \u0592\u2192\nsu(3)k\u2032 \u2295 su(3)3k\u2032 . In fact, there are two embeddings of su(2) into su(3) at our disposal\nwith embedding indices 1 and 4, respectively. If we employ the embedding with index 1\nfor \u01ebi and choose \u01eb\u20321 such that it has embedding index 4, then the anomaly cancellation\ncondition is satisfied.\n\n3\n\nThe boundary theory\n\nIn this section we will construct boundary states for the asymmetric coset theories. The\nheterotic nature of these models will force us to break part of the bulk symmetry. But for\na large class of asymmetric cosets we will be able to identify smaller chiral symmetries for\nwhich the boundary theory remains rational. Our discussion starts with a short reminder\non maximally symmetric and symmetry breaking branes on group manifolds. We will then\nargue that some of the symmetry breaking branes on G can descend to the asymmetric\ncoset and we will identify the localization of these branes in G/H. Formulas for the\nboundary states and the partition functions of the boundary theories will be provided at\nthe end of the section.\n\n3.1\n\nBranes on group manifolds\n\nAmong the branes on group manifolds, maximally symmetric branes are distinguished\nsince they preserve the whole chiral current algebra symmetry. The construction of maximally symmetric boundary conditions in the WZNW model requires to choose some gluing\nautomorphism \u03a9 of the chiral algebra A(G) so that we can glue holomorphic and antiholomorphic currents along the boundary. Before we describe a few results from boundary\nconformal field theory of the corresponding branes, let us briefly look at the geometric\nscenario these boundary conditions are associated with. It is by now well known that\nbranes constructed with \u03a9 = id are localized along conjugacy classes [13]. The general\ncase has an equally simple and elegant interpretation [14]. Note that gluing automorphisms \u03a9 for the current algebra A(G) are associated with automorphisms of the finite\ndimensional Lie algebra g which, after exponentiation, give rise to an automorphism \u03a9G\nof the group G. One can then show that maximally symmetric branes are localized along\nthe following twisted conjugacy classes in the group manifold,\nCu\u03a9 :=\n\n\b\n\ng u \u03a9G (g \u22121) g \u2208 G\n12\n\n.\n\n\fThe subsets Cu\u03a9 \u2282 G are parametrized through equivalence classes of group elements u\nwhere the equivalence relation between two elements u, v \u2208 G is given by: u \u223c\u03a9 v iff\nv \u2208 Cu\u03a9 . One should think of u as a coordinate that describes the transverse position of\nthe brane on the group manifold. In the exact conformal field theory, these coordinates\nare quantized.\nThe algebraic description of maximally symmetric D-branes was developed in [15] (see\nalso [16]). Their boundary states are labeled by representations of the twisted Kac-Moody\nalgebra which may be constructed from the Lie algebra g using the automorphism \u03a9. They\nare specific linear combinations of certain generalized coherent (or Ishibashi) states,\n|ui =\n\n\u03c8 \u03bc\np u |\u03bcii .\nS0\u03bc\n\nX\n\n\u03a9(\u03bc)=\u03bc\n\nAs usual, the generalized coherent states only implement the gluing conditions for the\ncurrents and there is one such state for each \u03a9-symmetric combination of irreducible \u011drepresentations in the charge conjugate state space of the WZNW theory. The coefficients\n\u03c8u \u03bc in the previous formula are directly related to the one-point functions of bulk fields in\nthe boundary theories and explicit expressions can be found in the literature [15]. From\nthe boundary states one can compute the partition function\nZuv =\n\nX\n\n\u03bd\u2208Rep(G)\n\nn\u03bd\n\n\u0001\n\nu\nv\n\n\u03c7\u03bd =\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03bd\u2208Rep(G) \u03bc=\u03a9(\u03bc)\n\n\u03bc\n\u03c8 \u0304u \u03c8v \u03bc S\u03bd\u03bc\n\u03c7\u03bd\nS0\u03bc\n\n\u0001 u\nfor each pair of labels u, v. The numbers n\u03bd v \u2208 N0 are the twisted fusion rules of \u011d.\nFor details of the construction we refer the reader to the existing literature.\nIn addition to these maximally symmetric branes, a large class of symmetry breaking\nbranes has been obtained in [8]. Their geometry was identified later in [9]. The construction of these branes requires to choose a chain of groups Us , s = 1, . . . , N, along\nwith homomorphisms \u01ebs : Us \u2192 Us+1 (we set UN = G). The latter are again assumed to\ninduce embeddings of the corresponding Lie algebras. Furthermore, one has to select an\nautomorphism \u03a9s on each group Us . Given these data, it is possible to construct a set\nof branes which preserve an U1 group symmetry. These are localized along the following\nsets\n\u03a9\n\u22121\nC\u01eb;u\n= CuNN * CuNN\u22121\n* . . . * Cu11 \u2282 G\n\nwhere\n\nCuss = \u03a9N \u25e6 \u01ebN \u22121 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03a9s+1 \u25e6 \u01ebs (Cu\u03a9ss ) \u2282 G\n\n(9)\nfor us \u2208 Us\n\nand CuNN = Cu\u03a9NN for uN \u2208 G. The * indicates that we consider the set of all points in G\nwhich can be written as products (with group multiplication) of elements from the various\nsubsets. One should stress that branes may be folded onto the subsets (9) such that a\n13\n\n\fgiven point is covered several times. This phenomenon has been observed for a special\ncase in [17]. For maximally symmetric branes on ordinary adjoint cosets the previous\ngeometry reduces to simpler expressions which have been found before [18, 19].\nTo illustrate this abstract construction, we show how to recover the symmetry breaking\nbranes on SU(2) that were found in [17]. In this case, we choose a chain of length\nN = 2 and set U1 = U(1). Let us then fix the automorphism \u03a91 on U(1) to be the\ninversion \u03a91 (\u03b7) = \u03b7 \u22121 for all \u03b7 \u2208 U(1). The automorphism \u03a92 of SU(2) is assumed to\nbe trivial and \u01eb1 can be any embedding of U(1) into SU(2). With these choices, the\ntwisted conjugacy classes C \u03a91 fill the whole one-dimensional circle U1 . When we multiply\npoints of the circle with elements in the spherical conjugacy classes C \u03a92 = C id of SU(2)\nthe resulting set sweeps out a three-dimensional subspace of SU(2) which can degenerate\nto a 1-dimensional circle. Hence, for this very special example, we reproduce exactly the\nfindings of [17].\n\n3.2\n\nBranes in asymmetric cosets\n\nHaving constructed maximally symmetric and symmetry breaking branes in the group G,\nour strategy now is to investigate which of these branes can pass down to the asymmetric\ncoset G/H. Geometrically, this is not too hard to understand. In fact, the natural idea\nis to look at all the symmetry breaking branes which are obtained from chains starting\nwith U1 = H and end at UN = G and to impose an extra condition on the choice of the\nautomorphisms \u03a9s and the homomorphisms \u01ebs so as to reflect the action of H on G in\nthe coset construction. Explicitly, the conditions on \u03a9s and \u01ebs read\n\u01ebL = \u01ebN \u22121 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u01eb1 ,\n\n(10)\n\n\u01ebR = \u03a9UN \u25e6 \u01ebN \u22121 \u25e6 \u03a9UN\u22121 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03a9U2 \u25e6 \u01eb1 \u25e6 \u03a9U1 ,\n\n(11)\n\nand\nOur claim is that the subsets (9) that are obtained from chains (Us , \u03a9s ) with homomorphisms \u01ebs pass down to subsets on the asymmetric coset G/H, provided that the data of\nthe chain are related to the data \u01ebL/R of the asymmetric coset G/H by eqs. (10) and (11).\nWe believe that the branes that are obtained in this way are the only ones that possess a\nrational boundary theory.\n\n3.3\n\nBoundary states and partition function\n\nWe now turn to the exact solution of the boundary conformal field theories which are\nused to describe the branes we talked about in the previous subsection. Our assumptions\non the existence of a chain of embeddings and its properties guarantee that the resulting\n\n14\n\n\ftheories are rational with respect to a chiral symmetry\nA = A(UN /UN \u22121 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 A(U3 /U2 ) \u2297 A(U2 /U1 ) .\nLet us stress that the left and right chiral algebra are isomorphic after symmetry reduction\nwhile this did not have to be the case before. For the rest of this section, let us restrict\nto embedding chains of length N = 3. This does not only cover all the examples to be\ndiscussed later on, but it also simplifies our notations. The extension to the general case\nwill be straightforward. We will also set \u03a91 = id = \u03a93 and write U2 = U.\nTo begin with, it is convenient to rewrite the bulk partition function of the asymmetric\ncoset model in terms of characters for the chiral algebra A that is left unbroken by the\nboundary condition. With our simplifying assumptions, this partition function becomes\nM\nM\nG/U\nU/H\nG/U\nU/H\nH =\nH(\u03bc,\u03b1) \u2297 H(\u03b1,a) \u2297 H\u0304(\u03bc,\u03b2)+ \u2297 H\u0304(\u03a9(\u03b2),a)+ .\n(12)\n[\u03bc,a]\u2208Rep(G/H) \u03b1,\u03b2\u2208Rep(U )\n\nWe had to include the automorphisms \u03a9 in one of the coset representations because in\nthe original formulation of the symmetry reduction left and right chiral algebra are just\nisomorphic, not identical. By explicit insertion of \u03a9 we are able to formulate the theory\nin terms of one single chiral algebra A.\n\nTo construct boundary states we have to find the symmetric part of the Hilbert space\n(12). From the G/U cosets we obtain the condition \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b2 modulo field identification\nof the form (e, J) \u2208 Gid (G/U). From the U/H cosets one arrives at \u03b1 = \u03a9(\u03b2). This is\ndue to the fact that elements of the field identification group Gid (U/H) can not have the\nform (J, e). The first condition then translates into \u03b1 = J\u03a9(\u03b1). We will assume that this\ncondition can only be fulfilled for \u03a9(\u03b1) = \u03b1.4 Generalized coherent states |\u03bc, \u03b1, aii for\nthis setup are labeled by triples \u03bc, \u03b1, a such that\n(\u03bc, \u03b1) \u2208 All(G/U)\n\n,\n\n(\u03b1, a) \u2208 All(U/H) ,\n\n\u03a9(\u03b1) = \u03b1 .\nIn addition we have to identify these generalized coherent states according to the identification rule\n|J\u03bc, \u03b1, J \u2032aii \u223c |\u03bc, \u03b1, aii for (J, J \u2032 ) \u2208 Gid .\n\nLet \u03c8z \u03b1 be the structure constants of twisted D-branes in the target space U. Whenever the tupel (\u03c1, z, r) satisfies the selection rule QJ (\u03c1) = QJ \u2032 (r) for all elements (J, J \u2032 ) \u2208\nGid we then may define boundary states for the asymmetric coset by\n|\u03c1, z, ri =\n4\n\nX\n\nG\nH\nS\u03c1\u03bc\n\u03c8z \u03b1 S\u0304ra\np\nP(\u03bc, \u03b1)P(\u03b1, a) q\n|\u03bc, \u03b1, aii .\nU\nH\nG S0\u03b1\nS\nS0\u03bc\n0a\n\nThis condition can be non-trivial only if there exist elements in the center of H which are mapped\nto the unit element by both \u01ebL and \u01ebR .\n\n15\n\n\fWe note that this is a consistent prescription since the formula does not depend on the\nspecific representative of the Ishibashi states. Also, we may implement the identification\nof boundary states\n|J\u03c1, z, J \u2032 ri \u223c |\u03c1, z, ri for (J, J \u2032 ) \u2208 Gid .\nUsing world-sheet duality it is not difficult to derive formulas for the boundary partition\nfunctions.

Our discussion starts with a short analysis of D-branes in the\nparafermionic cosets SU(2)/U(1) and branes therein. We then proceed to the spaces T pq\ngeneralizing the base of the conifold. The section concludes with a detailed investigation\nof branes in the Nappi-Witten background.\n\n16\n\n\f(x0 , x3 )\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n(x1 , x2 )\n\n0\n\nr\n\n1\n\nFigure 1: The group manifold SU(2) as a fibre over the unit intervall.\n\n4.1\n\nBranes in the parafermion background\n\nParafermion theories arise from cosets of the form SU(2)/U(1). There exist two choices\nof how the U(1) subgroup can be gauged: adjoint (vectorial) and axial gauging. D-branes\nfor these models have been worked out in [17, 7] and we will not have anything new to\nsee in this example. Our purpose is merely to introduce some of the tools that help to\nillustrate the bulk and brane geometries in specific examples. Recovering the geometry\nof the so-called A and B branes in parafermion theories from our general theory will be\nrather easy.\nThe first ingredient in our discussion is the SU(2) group manifold itself. It will be\nuseful for us to parametrize it in terms of two complex coordinates z1 , z2 ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nz1 z2\nwith z1 , z2 \u2208 C and |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 = 1 .\ng =\n\u2212z\u03042 z\u03041\nTo picture this space, we define the quantity r = |z1 | which takes values in the interval\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 1. Over each point r \u2208 [0, 1] the group manifold fibers into the direct product\n\u221a\n1\nSr1 \u00d7 S\u221a\n1 \u2212 r 2 , respectively. Hence, we find\nof\ntwo\ncircles\nwith\nradii\nr\nand\n2\n1\u2212r\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\b\n\b\nr ei\u03c61 , 1 \u2212 r 2 ei\u03c62 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 \u2282 C2 .\nSU(2) = (z1 , z2 ) |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 = 1 =\n\nIf we identify the complex numbers with euclidean 2-planes according to z1 = x0 + ix3\nand z2 = x1 + ix2 we arrive at the figures 1 and 2.\n\nNext we turn to the U(1) subgroup and its embeddings into SU(2). For the left\nembedding \u01ebL we shall use the map\n\u0001\n\u01ebL : ei\u03c4 7\u2192 ei\u03c4 , 0 .\nThe vector and axial gaugings arise from two different choices of the right homomorphism\n\u01ebL which we choose to be\n\u0001\nv/a\n\u01ebR : ei\u03c4 7\u2192 e\u00b1i\u03c4 , 0 .\n17\n\n\f(x0 , x3 )\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n(x1 , x2 )\n\n0\n\nr\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: A second illustration of the group manifold SU(2).\nThe associated actions of U(1) on SU(2) assume a rather simple form in the coordinates\n(z1 , z2 ),\n\u0001\n\u0001\nz1 , z2 \u2192\n7\nz1 , e2i\u03c4 z2 (vector)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nz1 , z2 \u2192\n7\ne2i\u03c4 z1 , z2 (axial) .\n\nand\n\nIn descending to the coset geometry, it is convenient to fix the gauge such that either z1\nor z2 is a positive real number. We thus arrive at the expressions\n\u221a\n\b\n\u0001\nSU(2)/U(1)vector =\nr ei\u03c6 , 1 \u2212 r 2 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 \u223c\n= D2\n\u0001\n\b \u221a\nSU(2)/U(1)axial =\nr, 1 \u2212 r 2 ei\u03c6 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 \u223c\n= D2 .\n\nIn both cases the target space is topologically given by a disc D 2 . This can also easily be\ninferred from the figures 1 and 2.\nLet us now proceed to the geometry of branes in this geometry. Our general recipe\ninstructs us to search for embedding chains of some depth N and then to pick automorphisms \u03a9s for each of the groups in the chain. Here our chains will have length N = 2,\nthey consist of U1 = U(1) and U2 = SU(2) with some homomorphism \u01eb : U1 \u2192 SU(2).\nOn U1 = U(1) there exist two different automorphisms \u03a91 , namely the identity id and the\ninversion \u03b3. The latter sends each \u03b7 \u2208 U(1) to its inverse \u03b3(\u03b7) = \u03b7 \u22121 . Automorphisms\n\u03a92 of SU(2) are all inner so that they are parametrized by elements of SU(2). As we\ndiscussed above, these data have to obey the two conditions (10, 11). In our situation this\nmeans that \u01eb = \u01ebL and \u03a92 \u25e6 \u01eb \u25e6 \u03a91 = \u01ebR . To describe solutions of the second condition we\nintroduce the following conjugation on SU(2),\n\u03b3\n\n\u0012\n\nz1 z2\n\u2212z\u03042 z\u03041\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nz1 z2\n\u2212z\u03042 z\u03041\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n0 1\n\u22121 0\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nz1 z2\n\u2212z\u03042 z\u03041\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nIn the case of the vector gauging, \u01ebR = \u01ebL and hence we look for pairs of \u03a91 , \u03a92 such that\n\u03a92 \u25e6 \u01eb \u25e6 \u03a91 = \u01eb. This is satisfied for (\u03a91 , \u03a92 ) = (id, id) and for (\u03a91 , \u03a92 ) = (\u03b3, \u03b3). While the\nfirst choice gives A-branes, the second is associated with B-branes in the terminology of\n18\n\n\f[17]. The analysis of axial gauging is similar and leads to the two possibilities (\u03a91 , \u03a92 ) =\n(id, \u03b3) and (\u03a91 , \u03a92 ) = (\u03b3, id).\nTo describe the D-branes in the parafermion theory we apply our general scheme\naccording to which we have to consider products of twisted conjugacy classes\nn\n\u0001\n\u0001o\n.\nC\u03bcSU (2) (\u03a92 ) * \u03a92 \u25e6 \u01eb CaU (1) (\u03a91 ) = gg\u03bc\u03a92 (g \u22121 ) * \u03a92 \u25e6 \u01eb hha \u03a91 (h\u22121 )\n\nHere, g\u03bc \u2208 SU(2) and ha \u2208 U(1) are two fixed elements and g \u2208 SU(2), h \u2208 U(1) are\nallowed to run over the whole groups. To make this more explicit let us restrict to the\ncase of vector gauging. For the A-branes one can easily see that the relevant conjugacy\nclasses have the form (with 2c = tr g\u03bc )\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\b\n\u0001\nC\u03bcSU (2) (id) =\nc \u00b1 i r 2 \u2212 c2 , 1 \u2212 r 2 ei\u03c62\n|c| \u2264 r \u2264 1\n\u0001\n\b\n\u01eb CaU (1) (id) = (eia , 0) .\nThe A-branes are then parametrized by\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\b\n\u0001\nC\u03bcSU (2) * \u01eb CaU (1) =\n(c \u00b1 i r 2 \u2212 c2 )eia , 1 \u2212 r 2 ei(\u03c62 \u2212a)\n\n|c| \u2264 r \u2264 1\n\n.\n\nIt is now very easy to depict these branes in the figures 1 and 2. After vector gauging\nwe recover one-dimensional branes stretching between two points on the boundary of the\ndisc. For c = 1 they degenerate to a point-like object on the boundary.\nIn the case of B-branes, we use the following twisted conjugacy classes on SU(2) and\nU(1) in our construction\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\b\n\u0001\nr ei\u03c61 , c \u00b1 i 1 \u2212 r 2 \u2212 c2 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 \u2212 c2 \u2264 1\nC\u03bcSU (2) (\u03b3) =\n\u0001\n\b\n\u03b3 \u25e6 \u01eb CaU (1) (\u03b3) = (ei\u03be , 0) 0 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 2\u03c0 .\n\nIf we take the product, the branes obviously fill the whole space in the figures 1 and 2 \u2013\n\u221a\nbut only for values 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 \u2212 c2 \u2264 1. After vector gauging we thus recover the usual\nB-branes which are two-dimensional discs centered around the origin of the target space\ndisc. For c = 0 they degenerate to a truly space filling brane. It is not difficult to work\nout the corresponding results for axial gauging.\n\n4.2\n\nT pq spaces and the conifold\n\nThe spaces T pq that we are about to analyze next are simple generalization of the space\nT 11 . The latter is a close relative of the base of the conifold in which the RR-fluxes of\nthe latter are replaced by a NSNS background field [3]. Our general theory provides a\nlarge class of boundary theories for this background, including branes that wrap one of\nthe three-spheres in T 11 . Related objects play an important role in the conifold geometry.\n19\n\n\fThe T pq spaces are defined to be quotients SU(2)k1 \u00d7 SU(2)k2 /U(1)k where the U(1)\n\u0001\nsubgroup acts by twisted conjugation, i.e. according to (g1 , g2 ) 7\u2192 g1 \u01ebp (h\u22121 ), \u01ebq (h)g2\nwhere \u01ebp (\u03b7) = \u01eb(\u03b7 p ) and \u01eb is the usual embedding of U(1) into SU(2). We obtain this\naction from the choice\n\u01ebL = e \u00d7 \u01ebq , \u01ebR = \u01ebp \u00d7 e .\nIf we parametrize the first factor SU(2) by (z1 , z2 ) as before and similarly use (z1\u2032 , z2\u2032 ) for\nthe second factor, we realize that the action of \u03b7 = exp(i\u03c4 ) \u2208 U(1) can be stated more\nexplicitly by the formula\n(z1 , z2 , z1\u2032 , z2\u2032 ) 7\u2192 (e\u2212ip\u03c4 z1 , eip\u03c4 z2 , eiq\u03c4 z1\u2032 , eiq\u03c4 z2\u2032 ) .\n\n(14)\n\nThe corresponding gauged WZNW functional is free of anomalies provided that k =\nk1 p2 = k2 q 2 (see condition (2)). Note that the resulting coset still has a SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)\n\u0001\nsymmetry which is realized by (g1 , g2) 7\u2192 h1 g1 , g2 h2 .\n\nThe geometry of the coset may be deduced from the action (14) by putting z1 to a\npositive real number. This works fine except for z1 = 0 where we have to gauge z2 for\ninstance. The resulting geometry is based on a product of a two-sphere times a threesphere. Due to the non-trivial embeddings only part of the U(1) has to be used for the\ngauging and a detailed analysis yields\nSU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)/U(1) = (S 2 \u00d7 S 3 )/Zp .\n\nLet us now have a look for the D-branes in this geometry. According to the general\nprocedure we are instructed to select a chain of groups. Here we will work with a chain\nof length N = 3 consisting of U1 = U(1), U2 = U(1) \u00d7 U(1) and U3 = SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2).\nWe also pick embedding maps \u01eb1 : U(1) \u2192 U(1) \u00d7 U(1) defined by \u01eb1 (\u03b7) = e \u00d7 \u03b7 and\n\u01eb2 : U(1) \u00d7 U(1) \u2192 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) given through \u01eb2 = \u01ebp \u00d7 \u01ebq . Furthermore, we shall\nassume that the automorphism \u03a91 is the identity map. The other two automorphisms\n\u03a92 = \u03a9\u2032 and \u03a93 = \u03a9 are allowed to be non-trivial. D-branes obtained from these data\nwrap the following product of twisted conjugacy classes,\nC SU (2)\u00d7SU (2) (\u03a9) * \u03a9 \u25e6 \u01ebL C U (1)\u00d7U (1) (\u03a9\u2032 )\n\n\u0001\n\n.\n\nIn writing this formula, we omitted the factor associated with a conjugacy class in U1 =\nU(1). Conjugacy classes of U(1) consist of a single point which we can choose to be the\nunit element. The sets above descend to the coset space T pq if \u03a9 \u25e6 \u01ebL \u25e6 \u03a9\u2032 = \u01ebR (note\nthat the condition \u01eb2 \u25e6 \u01eb1 = \u01ebL holds by construction). One solution to this condition is\n\u03a9 = id \u00d7 id and \u03a9\u2032 = \u03c3 the permutation of the two U(1) factors.\n20\n\n\fGiven these gluing automorphisms, the relevant conjugacy classes in SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)\nare given by\nC\u03bcSU (2) \u00d7 C\u03bdSU (2)\n\u221a\n\b \u00b1i\u03b8(r) \u221a\n\u2032 \u0001\n\u2032 \u2032\n=\nre\n, 1 \u2212 r 2 ei\u03c62 , r \u2032 e\u00b1i\u03b8 (r ) , 1 \u2212 r \u20322 ei\u03c62 |c| \u2264 r \u2264 1 , |c\u2032 | \u2264 r \u2032 \u2264 1\n\nwhere the signs \u00b1 may be chosen independently and r cos \u03b8(r) = c\u03bc = tr g\u03bc /2 as well as\nr \u2032 cos \u03b8\u2032 (r \u2032 ) = c\u03bd = tr g\u03bd /2. These equations may only be solved for r \u2265 |c\u03bc | and r \u2032 \u2265 |c\u03bd |.\nThe twisted conjugacy classes in U(1) \u00d7 U(1) are of the form\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u01ebL\n{ ei(a+\u03be) , 0, ei(a\u2212\u03be) , 0 } .\nCaU (1)\u00d7U (1) (\u03a9 = \u03c3) = { ei(a+\u03be) , ei(a\u2212\u03be) } 7\u2192\nCombining these two results we find the following expression for the product\n\n\u0001\nC\u03bcSU (2) \u00d7 C\u03bdSU (2) * \u01eb CaU (1)\u00d7U (1) (\u03a9 = \u03c3)\n\u221a\n\b \u00b1i\u03b8(r)+ip(a+\u03be) \u221a\n\u0001\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n=\nre\n, 1 \u2212 r 2 ei(\u03c62 \u2212p(a+\u03be)) , r \u2032 e\u00b1i\u03b8 (r )+iq(a\u2212\u03be) , 1 \u2212 r \u20322 ei(\u03c62 \u2212q(a\u2212\u03be))\n\nWe may use the gauge freedom to put the first entry to r. This is equivalent to setting\np\u03c4 = \u00b1\u03b8(r) + p(a + \u03be) in eq. (14). The resulting terms in the second and fourth entry\nmay be compensated by a redefinition of \u03c62 and \u03c6\u20322 . We are thus left with\n\u0001\nC\u03bcSU (2) \u00d7 C\u03bdSU (2) * \u01eb CaU (1)\u00d7U (1) (\u03a9 = \u03c3) /U(1)\n\u221a\n\b \u221a\n\u2032 \u0001\n\u2032 \u2032\n=\nr, 1 \u2212 r 2 ei\u03c62 , r \u2032e\u00b1i\u03b8 (r )\u00b1iq/p\u03b8(r)+2iqa , 1 \u2212 r \u20322 ei\u03c62\n\n.\n\nLet us point out that after gauging we eliminated the variable \u03be that parametrized the\ntwisted conjugacy classes in U(1) \u00d7 U(1). Hence, these branes in T pq have the same\ndimensionality as conjugacy classes in SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2), i.e. they are 0, 2 or 4\u2212dimensional.\n\nWe can also construct odd dimensional branes in T pq but this requires to change some\nof the data we have been using. We stay with the same groups Us and embeddings as\nabove but choose a different collection of automorphisms. For the group SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)\nwe use the non-trivial inner automorphism \u03a93 = (\u03b3, \u03b3) whose constituents have been\ndefined in eq. (13). The condition (11) may then be fulfilled if the automorphism \u03a92 of\nU(1) \u00d7 U(1) is given by the exchange of group factors and \u03a91 by the inversion \u03b3.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the twisted conjugacy classes in the group SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)\nare typically four-dimensional submanifolds of the form S 2 \u00d7S 2 while those of U(1)\u00d7U(1)\nand U(1) are both one-dimensional. One may easily see that the product of them inside\nSU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) is a submanifold of dimension 2, 4 or 6. After gauging the U(1) we are\nthus left with all kinds of odd-dimensional branes. When the levels are even, it is possible\nto find three-dimensional branes which fill one of the three-spheres of T pq . Related objects\nplay an important role for string theory on the conifold.\n21\n\n\f(X0 , X3 )\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n(X1 , X2 )\n\nr\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nFigure 3: The group manifold SL(2, R).\n\n4.3\n\nThe big-bang big-crunch scenario\n\nRecently, there has been renewed interest [6] in the Nappi-Witten background [5] which\ndescribes a closed universe between a big-bang and a big-crunch singularity. It was shown\nthat the dynamics couples the closed universe to regions in space-time which formerly were\nbelieved to be unphysical. The full geometry is given by the coset SL(2, R)\u00d7SU(2)/R\u00d7R\nwhere the groups in the numerator act asymmetrically on both factors in the denominator.\nHere we shall apply our general framework to the discussion of brane geometries in these\nasymmetric cosets. We believe that the construction of the corresponding boundary states\nin these non-compact backgrounds is possible using results from [20, 21].\nLet us review the geometry of the target space first. For our purposes it is convenient\nto parametrize the group manifold SL(2, R) according to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX0 + X3 X1 + X2\nwith X02 \u2212 X12 + X22 \u2212 X32 = 1, Xi \u2208 R .\n(15)\nX1 \u2212 X2 X0 \u2212 X3\nIn close analogy to the case of SU(2), this set can be depicted as a product of hyperbolas\nX12 \u2212 X22 = r and X02 \u2212 X32 = 1 + r in the (X1 , X2 )-plane and the (X0 , X3 )-plane,\nrespectively. These hyperbolas are fibered over the real coordinate r and they degenerate\nin one of the two planes for r = \u22121, 0. We thus have to distinguish the regions r > 0,\n0 > r > \u22121 and \u22121 > r. The resulting geometry is pictured in figure 3 as a fibre over\nr \u2208 R. The parametrization of SU(2) has already been given in section 4.1 (see figures 1\nand 2).\nIn the next step we have to specify the action of the subgroup R \u00d7 R on SL(2, R) \u00d7\nSU(2). To make contact with the general setting of section 2 let us introduce the notation\nG = G1 \u00d7G2 = SL(2, R)\u00d7SU(2) and H = R\u00d7R. The coset we want to consider is defined\nby using the identification g \u223c \u01ebL (h)g\u01ebR (h\u22121 ) where the left and right homomorphisms of\n\n22\n\n\f(X0 , X3 )\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n(X1 , X2 )\n\nr\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nFigure 4: The group manifold SL(2, R) after gauging.\nthe subgroup H are defined by [5]\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012 i\u03c4\n\u0012 \u03c1\ne\n0\ne\n0\n\u00d7\n\u01ebL (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) =\n0 e\u2212i\u03c4\n0 e\u2212\u03c1\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012 \u2212i\u03c1\n\u0012 \u2212\u03c4\ne\n0\ne\n0\n.\n\u00d7\n\u01ebR (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) =\n0 ei\u03c1\n0 e\u03c4\nUsing these expressions it is not difficult to see that the action of H leaves the quantities\nX02 \u2212 X32 , X12 \u2212 X22 , |z1 | and |z2 | invariant. In fact, these transformations correspond to\nboosts on the hyperbolas and rotations on the circles. Deviating from the analysis in\n[6] we will perform the gauge fixing completely in the SL(2, R) part of the target space.\nAs can easily be seen, the gauge transformations allow to gauge the SL(2, R) hyperbolas\ndown to two disconnected points. This procedure completely removes the gauge freedom\nexcept for singular points at r = \u22121, 0. These points correspond to the big-bang and bigcrunch singularities and we will not be concerned too much with details of the geometry\nat these special points. The findings of these considerations are illustrated in the figures\n4 and 5.\nIt is now only a short step to recover the results of [6]. Let us introduce the notation\nL, R, T, B which are shorthand for left, right, top and bottom and specify the location\nof points in figure 4. The regions of SL(2, R) which appear in the fibre over r \u2208 R can\nbe described by pairs of symbols L, R, T, B. A short look at figure 4 reveals that only\ntwelve different combinations are allowed. Working out the connectivity properties of\nthese different regions we arrive at figure 6 which has also been obtained in [6]. In order\nto simplify the comparison with [6] we have adopted their notation. The translation can\nbe performed by means of table 1 (see also figure 7). From figure 6 we observe that\nthere are four closed compact universes I\u2013IV which are connected at the big-bang and\nbig-crunch singularities. At each instant of time they have the topology of a three-sphere\nS 3 if one takes the SU(2) factor into account. The periodicity of time may be resolved\nby going to the infinite cover AdS3 of SL(2, R). In addition to the closed universes there\n23\n\n\fL\nT\n(X0 , X3 )\nB\nT\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\nR\nL\n\n(X1 , X2 )\nR\nB\nr\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nFigure 5: An alternative representation of the group manifold SL(2, R) after gauging.\nare eight whiskers which are also connected to the singularities. Over each point in the\nwhisker one has a S 3 .\nLet us now begin to place branes into this geometry. Once more we shall work with\nchains of length N = 2 and the homomorphism \u01eb = \u01ebL : U1 = R \u00d7 R \u2192 U2 = SL(2, R) \u00d7\nSU(2). If we define an automorphism \u03a9 of R\u00d7R by \u03a9(\u03c4, \u03c1) = (\u2212\u03c1, \u2212\u03c4 ) then our condition\n(11) is satisfied whenever\n\u03a92 \u25e6 \u01eb \u25e6 \u03a91 = \u01eb \u25e6 \u03a9 .\nD-branes in our background should be localized along the following product of twisted\nconjugacy classes,\nh\ni\n\u0001\nC\u03bcSL(2,R) (\u03c91 ) \u00d7 C\u03bdSU (2) (\u03c91\u2032 ) * (\u03c91 \u00d7 \u03c91\u2032 ) \u25e6 \u01eb CaR\u00d7R (\u03a92 ) ,\n(16)\n\nbefore projecting to the coset. Here, we split \u03a91 = \u03c91 \u00d7 \u03c91\u2032 into the product of automorphisms for SL(2, R) and SU(2), respectively. There are several choices of automorphisms\n\u03a92 , \u03c91 , \u03c91\u2032 which satisfy our condition and we will discuss all of them in the following.\nLet us start with the discussion of the twisted conjugacy class CaR\u00d7R (\u03a92 ). The most\ngeneral automorphism of the additive group R \u00d7 R is implemented by a non-singular\n2 \u00d7 2-matrix. In our situation, however, not all choices are allowed. The only choices\nwhich have the chance to be consistent with condition (11) are \u03a92 (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) = (\u03b7\u03c4, \u03be\u03c1) where\n\u03b7, \u03be = \u00b11. The resulting geometry is given by\n(\nR\u00d7R\n, for \u03be = \u2212\u03b7\n(17)\nCaR\u00d7R (\u03a92 ) =\n\b\n(f1 + \u03bb, f2 \u2212 \u03b7\u03bb) \u03bb \u2208 R , for \u03be = \u03b7 .\nThe embedding of these sets into SL(2, R) \u00d7 SU(2) via the map (\u03c91 \u00d7 \u03c91\u2032 ) \u25e6 \u01eb leads to the\nsame result in both cases after gauge fixing.\n\nWhen investigating the geometry of the D-branes (16) in the big-bang big-crunch\ntarget space it is convenient to focus on the SL(2, R) part as all interesting features arise\n24\n\n\fI\n4\u2032\n\n4\nIV\n\n3\u2032\n\n3\nIII\n\n2\u2032\n\n2\nII\n\n1\u2032\n\n1\nI\n\nFigure 6: The big-bang/big-crunch scenario.\nfrom this factor. We thus only have to distinguish two different cases, corresponding to\nthe two types of twisted conjugacy classes of SL(2, R). As most of the group SL(2, R)\nwill be gauged away, it suffices to address the following two questions:\n1. Which ranges of r are covered by the twisted conjugacy classes?\n2. Does the twisted conjugacy class extend along one or even both branches of the\nhyperbolas, i.e. does the D-brane cover one or two points for fixed value of r after\ngauging?\nThe twisted conjugacy classes of SL(2, R) are easily described. For untwisted conjugacy classes one has two types. There are two point-like conjugacy classes which correspond to the center of SL(2, R) while all others are two-dimensional. The exact shape\nhas been worked out in [22, 23] but we will not need these details. The point-like branes\nare specified by X0 = \u00b11 and X1 = X2 = X3 = 0, i.e. they are localized at r = 0.\nAfter gauging they sit at the singularities between the closed universes I\u2013II and III\u2013IV,\nrespectively. The two-dimensional conjugacy classes are of the form X0 = C = const.\nwith arbitrary values of the remaining coordinates. According to the constraint (15) we\nobtain r = C 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 X32 \u2264 C 2 \u2212 1. This means that the conjugacy class after gauging\ncovers at least all four whiskers 2, 2\u2032 , 4, 4\u2032. For C 6= 0 the conjugacy class grows into two\nof the four closed universes starting from the singularity which joins them. Depending\non the sign of C these are the regions I\u2013II (for C > 0) and III\u2013IV (for C < 0). If |C|\nreaches the value 1 (from below) the conjugacy class stretches completely through both\nof the closed universes. Increasing |C| further, the conjugacy classes start to reach into\ntwo of the remaining whiskers \u2013 1, 1\u2032 for C > 1 and 3, 3\u2032 for C < \u22121. Note, that the\nmultiplication with the twisted conjugacy class of R \u00d7 R has no influence on the possible\nvalues of r as it simply corresponds to some boost on the hyperbolas which will be gauged\naway in any case.\n25\n\n\f(X1 , X2 )\n\n(X0 , X3 )\n\u0012\n+\n\u0012\n\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0012\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\n+\n\n\u0013\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\nFigure 7: Different regions of SL(2, R) and where they appear in our picture.

It may be described by conjugation with the element M = ( 01 10 ). The\ncorresponding twisted conjugacy classes are given by tr(Mg) = 2X1 = 2C = const.\nAccording to the constraint (15) we obtain r = C 2 \u2212 X22 \u2264 C 2 . The discussion is similar\nas in the untwisted case. For all values of C the twisted conjugacy classes pass through\nall four closed universes I\u2013IV and the four whiskers 2, 2\u2032 , 4, 4\u2032. For C 6= 0 the conjugacy\nclasses also cover part of the whiskers 1, 3\u2032 (C > 0) or 1\u2032 , 3 (C < 0). The results of the\nlast two paragraphs are illustrated in figure 8.\nSo far we have only considered the SL(2, R) part of the target space. To obtain the\ncomplete picture we have also to take the SU(2) part into account as well as the product\nwith the twisted conjugacy class CaR\u00d7R (\u03c9). We already argued that the latter has no effect\non the SL(2, R) part as it does not affect the value of r and may thus be gauged away.\nThis statement also implies that the resulting D-branes factorize (in the same sense as the\ngauge fixing factorized). If we try to solve condition (11) with \u03c91 = id, i.e. if we want to\ntake the ordinary conjugacy classes in the SL(2, R) part, we have to use an automorphism\n\u03a92 of R \u00d7 R with \u03b7 = 1. Depending on the choice of \u03be we are still able to obtain both\nexpressions for twisted conjugacy classes that appear in eq. (17). The same statement\nholds true for \u03b7 = \u22121, i.e. for the case of a twisted conjugacy class in the SL(2, R) part.\n\nIt is now very simple to describe the geometry of the D-branes in the SU(2) part. We\nsimply have to multiply the (shifted) conjugacy class of SU(2) with elements of the form\ndiag(ei\u03bb , e\u2212i\u03bb ) for all values of \u03bb. As was observed in [17, 24] and more in the spirit of our\napproach in [9], this corresponds to a smearing of the original conjugacy class.\nLet us conclude with a short summary of our results.

While the D-branes\ncover the high-lightened regions in the SL(2, R) part, we also have a three-sphere over\neach of these points which is partly covered by the D-brane. The geometry of the latter\nis either given by a circle around some equator or by a smeared two-sphere which covers\na three-dimensional subset of S 3 .\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work we presented a comprehensive description of asymmetric coset models G/H\nfor which the action of H on G is not necessarily given by the adjoint. A bulk partition\nfunction was proposed based on a semi-classical analysis in the large volume limit and the\nmodular invariance of this partition function was shown to be equivalent to the anomaly\ncancellation that is known from the Lagrangian description of the coset.\nWe then provided a general prescription of constructing branes in asymmetric cosets.\nDue to the heterotic nature of the models, one is naturally lead to boundary states which\nbreak part of the symmetry of the bulk theory. The geometry of the branes may be\ndeduced from those of symmetry breaking branes on group manifolds [9]. Branes which\npossess a symmetry compatible with the gauge action were argued to descend naturally\nto the coset.\nOur general findings have been used to construct D-branes in the cosmological NappiWitten background (big-bang big-crunch space-time) and in the base S 2 \u00d7 S 3 of the\nconifold. Among the branes in the big-bang big-crunch space-time there are examples\nwhich cross the singularities and run through all the universes. In the base of the conifold\nwe found branes of all dimensions. For even values of the level one may construct branes\nwhich fill one of the three-spheres.\nBefore we conclude let us mention a few open problems which remain to be solved.\n\n27\n\n\fOur algebraic construction of branes in asymmetric cosets was designed for the case that\nleft and right action of the gauge group can be related by automorphisms in a chain\nof intermediate groups (asymmetric cosets of generalized automorphism type). If this\ncondition is not fulfilled, one could be tempted to follow [7] (see also [9]) and to propose\ngeneralized conjugacy classes for the geometry of the corresponding branes. While this\nprocedure works fine on the Lagrangian level, we have not been able to implement it in\nan algebraic approach.\nAnother issue is the discussion of the stability and the dynamics of our branes. In the\ngeometric regime the question of stability should be accessible from a Born-Infeld analysis\n[17]. One may even hope to go one step beyond such an analysis and to construct the noncommutative gauge theory which governs the dynamics of branes in asymmetric cosets\n[25]. It may also well be that the results of [26] generalize to asymmetric cosets.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank B. Acharya, S. Fredenhagen, A. Giveon, N. Kim and I. Runkel for\nremarks and discussions. One of us (T.Q.) is also grateful to M. Tierz and the people at\nthe SPhT for their kind hospitality. This work was initiated in discussions with B. Acharya\nwhile one of the authors (V.S.) was visiting the string group at Rutgers University. The\nresearch of T.Q. was financially supported by the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes.\n\nA\n\nThe GMM cosets revisited\n\nModels of the type which have been discussed in section 2.4.2 first appeared in [1, 2].\nThese authors presented a Lagrangian formulation of these theories and considered the\nassociated current algebra. In our opinion their discussion of the algebraic properties is\nnot completely accurate. In particular they argued that the energy momentum tensor is\nnot obtained by the standard affine Sugawara [27, 28, 29] and coset constructions [29, 30]\nwhich seems to be incorrect. We take this as an opportunity to review the Lagrangian\ndescription and to clarify some statements.\nThe gauged WZNW functional (4) is quadratic in the gauge fields. It may thus be\nsimplified \u2013 in principle \u2013 by integrating out the gauge fields. The resulting expressions\nwill, however, remain quite formal in the general case (see however [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,\n37]). The reason for these difficulties is the third term in the interaction functional (5)\nwhich does not only contain the gauge fields A and \u0100 but also the group element g. For\nthe Gaussian path integral to be performed one would need to diagonalize the quadratic\nform matrix which depends explicitly on g.\nFor our particular choice of embeddings the corresponding term vanishes and the path\n\n28\n\n\fintegral may easily be evaluated. The interaction functional (5) reduces to\nZ\n\b\nk1\nG1 \u00d7G2 /H\n \u0304 1 \u2212 \u01eb1 (\u0100)\u01eb1 (A)\nSint\n(g1 , g2 , A, \u0100|k, \u01ebL/R ) =\nd2z Tr1 \u22122\u01eb1 (A)g1\u22121\u2202g\n4\u03c0 \u03a3\nZ\n\b\nk2\nd2z Tr2 2\u01eb2 (\u0100)\u2202g2 g2\u22121 \u2212 \u01eb2 (\u0100)\u01eb2 (A) .\n+\n4\u03c0 \u03a3\n\nIt is fairly simple to read off the quadratic form matrix from this expression and integrate\nout the gauge fields in full generality. We only have to be a bit careful about our notations.\nWe may decompose the h-valued gauge fields A and \u0100 according to A = A\u03b1 T \u03b1 and \u0100 =\n\u0100\u03b1 T \u03b1 . The abstract Lie algebra generators satisfy the commutation relations [T \u03b1 , T \u03b2 ] =\nif \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 T \u03b3 . Indices are raised and lowered using the Killing form5\n\b\n2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b2 = Tr T \u03b1 T \u03b2\n\nand its inverse. We may choose generators T i \u2208 {\u01eb1 (T \u03b1 ), T I } of g1 and generators T a \u2208\n{\u01eb2 (T \u03b1 ), T A } of g2 . These satisfy [T i , T j ] = if ij k T k and [T a , T b ] = if ab c T c . If all three\nindices take values in the subalgebra h, the structure constants by construction just reduce\nto the structure constants of h in the given basis. This is only true as long as the index\nstructure is as indicated because one would have to use different Killing forms to lower\nthe indices. From (1) it follows that they satisfy\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\n1 /x1 = \u03ba2 /x2 .\n\nWe see the embedding indices xi entering this expression.\nThe last relations imply\n= 2 x1 \u0100\u03b1 A\u03b1\n\n\b\nTr1 \u01eb1 (\u0100) \u01eb1 (A)\n\nThe formula\n\n\b\nTr2 \u01eb2 (\u0100) \u01eb2 (A)\n\n= 2 x2 \u0100\u03b1 A\u03b1 .\n\n(2\u03c0)n/2 1 bT A\u22121 b\n= \u221a\n.\ne2\ndet A\nfor the Gaussian path integral may thus be applied with\n\b\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u03b1\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 k1\n\u0013\nx1 k1\n\u03b1 \u22121  \u0304\n0\nA\n\u03ba\nTr\n\u01eb\n(T\n)g\n\u2202g\n\u2212\n\u03b1\u03b2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\b\nA = x2 k2\ny =\nb =\n.\nk2\n\u0100\u03b2\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\n0\nTr2 \u01eb2 (T \u03b1 )\u2202g2 g2\u22121\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nZ\n\n1 T\nAy+bT y\n\ndny e\u2212 2 y\n\nThe matrix A is symmetric as by assumption k = x1 k1 = x2 k2 .

By construction it is invariant under the infinitesimal gauge transformations\n\u0001\n(g1 , g2 ) 7\u2192 g1 (1\u2212i \u01eb1 (\u03a9)), (1+i \u01eb2 (\u03a9))g2 with \u03a9 = \u03a9(z, z\u0304) \u2208 h. In addition, the model ad\u0001\n\u2032\u22121\n\u2032\nmits the symmetry GL1 (z) \u00d7GR\n2 (z\u0304), i.e. it is invariant under (g1 , g2 ) 7\u2192 g1 (z)g1 , g2 g2 (z\u0304) .\nThe last symmetry is generated by the currents\n\b\nk2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\ng1 \u01eb1 (T \u03b1 )g1\u22121 Tr2 \u01eb2 (T \u03b2 ) \u2202g2 g2\u22121\n2 x1\n\b\nk1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b2 \u22121\n \u0304 1\n \u0304\ng2 \u01eb2 (T \u03b2 )g2 Tr1 \u01eb1 (T \u03b1 ) g1\u22121\u2202g\nJ(z\u0304)\n= J \u03042 +\n2 x2\n\nJ(z) = J1 \u2212\n\n.\n\n \u0304\nThey satisfy \u2202J(z)\n= \u2202 J \u0304(z\u0304) = 0 by the equations of motion. During the derivation we\nused the relation x1 k1 = x2 k2 . Note that J takes values in the Lie algebra g1 , while J \u0304 is\nfrom g2 . This means that the index structure is J i , J \u0304a which makes explicit the heterotic\nnature of our coset. Both currents are gauge invariant.\nIn the algebraic description of our asymmetric coset model we already assumed some\nproperties which would have been expected from a straightforward generalization of the\nGKO construction. We are now able to justify this procedure more rigorously by working\nout the energy momentum tensor and the commutation relations of the currents. Let us\nstart with the latter. It is convenient to introduce the fields\n \u0304 1\nJ \u03041 = k1 g1\u22121 \u2202g\n \u0304 2\nJ \u03042 = k2 g2\u22121 \u2202g\n\nJ1 = \u2212k1 \u2202g1 g1\u22121\n\nJ2 = \u2212k2 \u2202g2 g2\u22121\n\nwhich correspond to the (former) G1 and G2 currents, respectively. In terms of these\nquantities one obtains\n\b\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\ng1 \u01eb1 (T \u03b1 )g1\u22121 Tr2 \u01eb2 (T \u03b2 )J2\n2 x1\n\b\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2 \u22121\n \u0304\nJ(z\u0304)\n= J \u03042 +\ng2 \u01eb2 (T \u03b2 )g2 Tr1 \u01eb1 (T \u03b1 )J \u03041\n2 x2\nJ(z) = J1 +\n\n.\n\nThe symmetry GL1 (z) \u00d7 GR\n2 (z\u0304) implies the Ward identities [38, (15.40)]\nI\ndz\n(1)\n\u03a9i hJ i (z)X(w, w\u0304)i\n\u03b4L hX(w, w\u0304)i = \u2212\n2\u03c0i\nI\ndz\u0304\n(2)\n\u03b4R hX(w, w\u0304)i =\n\u03a9a hJ \u0304a (z\u0304)X(w, w\u0304)i ,\n2\u03c0i\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhich are related to the transformations \u03b4L g1 = i \u03a9i T i g1 and \u03b4R g2 = \u2212i g2 \u03a9a T a .

In\nparticular in the last reference due to usage of intransparent notation it was not realized\nthat the energy momentum tensor is actually defined by the standard affine Sugawara\nconstruction combined with the coset construction.\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
