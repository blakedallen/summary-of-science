Introduction\nThe observed acceleration of cosmic expansion is most simply explained by positing\na small positive cosmological constant (c.c.) in the low energy effective Lagrangian\nfor the metric of four dimensional space. The existence of a positive cosmological\nconstant raises a host of problems for theoretical high energy physics. One would like\nto understand the magnitude of this parameter, and the nature of quantum observables\nin the asymptotically de Sitter (dS) space-time that results.\nWith regard to the first question, Weinberg's galactothropic bound on the cosmological constant[1] seems to provide a satisfactory answer to the question both of the\nabsolute magnitude and the ratio of the c.c. to the current matter density. This assumes that one has a theory in which the dark matter density \u03c10 and the strength of\nprimordial fluctuations Q are fixed as one varies the c.c. or that Q and \u03c10 vary with \u039b\nin such a way as to take on their real world values at the real world value of \u039b. Theories in which all three parameters are independent random variables are somewhat less\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fattractive, but can still account for a reduction of the \"expected\" value of the c.c. by\nmany orders of magnitude[2].\nThere are two classes of meta-physical theories which are based on plausible dynamics, and could give rise to a plethora of universes with different values of the c.c. We\ncall them meta-physical because, at least with current understanding, there is no way\nto make observations on the alternative universes. The more famous of the two is called\nthe String Landscape[3], though much of it is based on ideas that are more than 20\nyears old and had no connection with string theory. Holographic cosmology[4] presents\na picture of a metaverse consisting of many asymptotically dS space-times embedded\nin a dense black hole fluid. In the Landscape, all parameters of low energy physics vary\nas we jump from universe to universe, while in holographic cosmology it is plausible\nthat only the c.c. and things which depend on it in the limit when it is small, vary.\nThere is as yet no mathematical formulation of what the Landscape is, though there\nhave been some interesting attempts to construct one[5]. The holographic cosmology\nof a defect free dense black hole fluid has been mathematically formulated[4], but not\nthe theory of the asymptotically dS defects in the fluid.\nMetaphysical theories are useful, if at all, only for understanding values of low\nenergy parameters1 , which cannot be explained by ordinary dynamical mechanisms.\nTo a large extent, once the parameters are chosen the metaphysical theory is of little\npractical relevance. This is particularly true in the holographic cosmology approach,\nwhere the structure of the theory dictates that dynamics inside each asymptotically dS\nbubble is independent of the outside.\nFrom this point of view at least, the task of theoretical physics is to construct a\nquantum theory of a single asymptotically dS universe. It may be that such a theory will\nalso be useful as an approximation to a future mathematical theory of the Landscape.\nAt any rate, this is the task we will take up in the present paper. In fact, we will take\nup a somewhat more modest task. In the mid 80s, the focus of string theorists was\non finding a Poincar\u00e9 invariant description of the real world. This was not because\nstring theorists were ignorant of the existence of cosmology, but because they imagined\nthat the laws of particle scattering were, to a good approximation independent of both\nthe asymptotic past and future. This project failed because no one has ever found a\nconsistent model of quantum gravity which is Poincar\u00e9 invariant in d flat spacetime\ndimensions without being super-Poincar\u00e9 invariant. Nor have we found asymptotically\nAdS theories with radius large compared to the string scale in which SUSY is broken\nin most of the volume of AdS.\n1\n\nHere we conform to the conventional and incorrect language which identifies the c.c. as a low\nenergy parameter. In all examples we understand, it is in fact related to the physics of the highest\nenergy states in the theory, which are large black holes.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fOur own take on this failure is that it indicates a close connection between the\nSUSY breaking we observe in the real world, and the fact that we have a positive\nc.c.[6] . The analog of the old string theory program is to construct a theory in eternal\ndS space, which will contain an approximation to particle physics where SUSY breaking\nis evident, but the time dependence of cosmology is neglected. If you are with us so\nfar, we can proceed to the construction of the theory.\n\n2. General rules of holographic space-time\nIn the course of constructing a holographic cosmology, the authors of [4] also invented\na general formalism for the holographic description of space-time. It is motivated by\nsimple kinematic considerations about the nature of observers in quantum mechanics,\nthe causal structure of Lorentzian space-times, and the covariant entropy bound[7].\nIn quantum mechanics, an observer is a large quantum system with many semiclassical observables. The only way we know how to construct mathematical models\nof such systems is to use the rules of (possibly cut off) quantum field theory. Indeed,\na field theory in finite volume is such an observer. Averages of local fields over significant fractions of the volume have very small quantum fluctuations. The tunneling\namplitudes between states with different values of these macroscopic pointer variables\nd\ngo like e\u2212cV M where M is the cutoff momentum scale and d the dimension of the world\nvolume of the field theory. The precise observations of the mathematical formalism of\nquantum mechanics, in which we imagine that observables of a small system can be\nmeasured with arbitrary precision, are well approximated by machines which follow\nthe rules of quantum field theory, for V M d a few orders of magnitude. In realistic\nlaboratory situations this number is of order V M d \u223c 1023 .\nIt is an experimental fact, and follows from the rules of quantum field theory,\nthat any such observer has a large mass, and will follow a time-like trajectory in D\ndimensional space-time. The rules of holographic space-time are constructed in order to\ndescribe the observations made by these time-like observers in a way that is compatible\nwith the holographic principle. Associated with any segment of a future directed timelike trajectory, going from a point P to a point Q in its future, there is a causal diamond,\nconsisting of the intersection of the interior of the backward light-cone of Q with that\nof the forward like cone of P. The boundary of this diamond is a null surface, and the\nmaximal area space-like D \u2212 2 submanifold on this surface is called the holographic\nscreen of the causal diamond. The covariant entropy bound bounds the entropy flowing\nout through the future boundary of the diamond, by one quarter of the area of this\nscreen, in Planck units. We can reconstruct the time-like trajectory from a nested\nsequence of causal diamonds.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fIn quantum mechanics entropy always refers to a particular density matrix, and\nFischler and Banks argued that the only natural density matrix to choose in implementing this principle for a generic space-time is the maximally uncertain density matrix,\nproportional to 1. Alternatives, like a thermal density matrix, require a preferred definition of the Hamiltonian, which is anathema in a generally covariant theory. With this\nchoice, the entropy referred to in the covariant bound is the logarithm of the dimension\nof the Hilbert space associated with the diamond.\nThere is a natural way to construct a finite dimensional Hilbert space from classical\nconstructs associated with the diamond. Consider a small area, or pixel, on the holographic screen. The screen lies on a null surface and, on the center of this pixel there is\nan orthogonal null ray which penetrates the pixel. Actually there is an ambiguity here\ncorresponding to whether the null ray is ingoing or outgoing. We should use both, but\nimagine that dynamics relates the incoming to outgoing rays, so we will describe only\nvariables associated with the outgoing ones. The null direction, and the orientation of\nthe pixel, which is a bounded region of a space-like D \u2212 2 plane orthogonal to the null\ndirection, are both encoded in a pure spinor, a solution of the Cartan-Penrose equation:\n\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8 = 0.\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe independent real solutions to this equation are quantized according to\n[Sa , Sb ]+ = \u03b4ab .\n\n(2.2)\n\nSa , or possibly complex linear combinations of them (depending on D) transform as\nspinors in the tangent space of the holographic screen. More generally, we can and\nshould enlarge the algebra of pixel operators to include information about compactified\nspatial dimensions[8].\nThe quantization of pixel operators defines an area for the pixel, via the BekensteinHawking relation. Extending this to all pixels of all holographic screens of all causal\ndiamonds of all observers, one would (over) determine the Lorentzian geometry of\nspace-time. A finite area holographic screen would have an operator algebra\n[Sa (m), Sb (n)]+ = \u03b4ab \u03b4mn ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere we have exploited a Z2 gauge invariance of the CP equation and the commutation\nrelations to Klein transform the commutation relations between independent pixels into\nanti-commutation relations. This Z2 is associated with space-time (\u22121)F and imposes\nthe spin-statistics connection on our formalism.\nThe operators Sa (n) should be thought of as a section of the spinor bundle of the\nholographic screen. The fact that they are finite in number (since the screen has finite\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\farea) means that we have pixelated the screen by replacing its function algebra by a\nfinite dimensional algebra.\nIt is extremely interesting that the representation space of the Sa (n) for fixed n\nis precisely that of the spin degrees of freedom of a massless superparticle with fixed\nmomenta. So the degrees of freedom of a pixel on the holoscreen are precisely those of\na massless superparticle which penetrates that pixel.\nLet us now specialize to the case of four dimensional de Sitter space. It is clear that\nour set-up is observer dependent. In a symmetric space we are free to choose special\ncoordinates which exhibit the symmetry. In order to describe the holographic screen of\nthe cosmological horizon of an individual observer we want to implement the obvious\nSU(2) symmetry of the screen. We also have a special operator corresponding to the\ngenerator of motion H along the time-like Killing vector seen by this observer. H will\nbe the focus of our attention in the next section.\nAn SU(2) invariant way of pixelating the geometry of the two-sphere is to introduce\nthe fuzzy sphere algebra (the algebra of N \u00d7N matrices) as the definition of the topology\nof the sphere2 . The spinor bundle over the fuzzy sphere is the module of rectangular\nN \u00d7 N + 1 matrices, which contains all half integral spin representations of SU(2) up\nto N \u2212 12 .\nThe operator algebra of the cosmological horizon is thus\n[\u03c8iA , (\u03c8 \u2020 )jB ]+ = \u03b4ij \u03b4BA .\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe dimension of this fermionic Hilbert space is 2N (N +1) , which means that in the large\nN limit we should identify\n4N 2 ln 2 = \u03c0(RMP )2 ,\n(2.5)\nwhere R is the dS radius. For dS space, we believe the density matrix to be e\u22122\u03c0RH ,\nbut we will see below that the spectrum of H is such that this estimate of the relation\nbetween R and N is unchanged for large N.\n\n3. The static hamiltonian and the hamiltonian of Poincar\u00e9\nThe causal diamond of a time-like geodesic observer in dS space is covered by the static\ncoordinate patch\nds2 = \u2212f (r)d\u03c4 2 +\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 d\u03a92 ,\nf (r)\n\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nGelfand's theorem shows us the functorial identity between the topology of a compact Hausdorff\nspace and its commutative C* algebra of complex valued functions. A key idea of non-commutative\ngeometry is to simply identify a space with every C* algebra.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fwhere\nf (r) = 1 \u2212\n\nr2\n.\nR2\n\nIn [9] one of the authors presented a qualitative ansatz for the Hamiltonian H, which\ngenerates time evolution with respect to the static time \u03c4 . The claim is that the\nc\nspectrum of H is bounded by cTdS = 2\u03c0R\n, where c is a constant of order one. The Hilbert\n2\nspace on which H acts has dimension of order e\u03c0(RMP ) , where Newton's constant,\n2\nG = MP\u22122 . The spectral density of H is thus e\u2212\u03c0(RMP ) .\nConsider, for fixed c, a random Hamiltonian with these properties, chosen from any\nsmooth probability distribution, and a fixed initial state, |\u03c8 > in the Hilbert space.\nSince H is random, time averaged correlation functions in the state |\u03c8 > will approach\nthermal equilibrium, with an equilibrium temperature T = k\u03c8 TdS . We conjecture that,\nfor large R, and generic |\u03c8 > (chosen from a uniform probability distribution on the\nunit sphere in Hilbert space), k\u03c8 will approach some average value k\u0304\u03c8 . By adjusting c\nwe can choose k\u0304\u03c8 = 1. Thus we claim that the spectral characteristics assumed for H\ncan explain why dS space is a thermal system with a unique temperature (see appendix\nfor details).\nThis picture of the spectrum of H is supported by two other observations about\ndS space. The most striking is the formula for Coleman-De Luccia (CDL) tunneling\nprobabilities between two different dS vacua. These satisfy a law of detailed balance\nconsistent with the picture of dS space as a quantum system with a finite number of\nstates, but with the free energy replaced by the entropy. This makes sense for a thermal\ndensity matrix if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is bounded by something close to\nthe temperature.\nThe second piece of evidence is that every localized object in de Sitter space decays\nto the vacuum. Classically the vacuum has zero energy and it makes sense to say that\nthe real quantum vacuum is an ensemble of states with energies below TdS (which\nvanishes in the limit R \u2192 \u221e). A black hole has a large classical mass, and it is\ninconsistent with energy conservation to say that it decays to a state with small energy.\nWe conclude that the black hole mass cannot be close to an eigenvalue of H.\nThe aim of [9] was to come up with a quantum model that accounts for all of the\nthings we think we know about dS space from the approximation called quantum field\ntheory in curved space-time. That approximation indeed finds a thermal density matrix\nat the dS temperature, but with a Hamiltonian, which we will call P0 , whose eigenvalues\ninclude particle masses. QFTCST theorists think of P0 as the generator of static time\ntranslations, but they also claim that P0 approaches the ordinary Hamiltonian of a\nPoincar\u00e9 invariant theory as R \u2192 \u221e. This is inconsistent with our model for the\nspectrum of H.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fP0 and H are thus different operators. P0 is in fact only an emergent quantity. It\ndescribes localized excitations in a given horizon volume, which are unstable to decay\n(via the true H dynamics of the system) into the dS vacuum. It is useful because\nthe time scales involved in P0 dynamics are short compared to the decay times of the\nexcitations. We view the eigenvalues of P0 to be the proper description of particle\nmasses and the masses of black holes.\nTo understand how the thermal ensemble with Hamiltonian H can look like the\nthermal ensemble with Hamiltonian P0 , we postulate a peculiar relation between the\nP0 eigenvalue and the entropy deficit of the corresponding eigenspace. The calculations\ndone in QFTCST are an approximation in which decays of most localized systems do\nnot occur. In this approximation we do not really resolve the spectrum of H and it\nmakes sense to take H \u2248 0. In that case the probability in the thermal density matrix\nof H for having P0 eigenvalue E is just\n2\n\nTr eE e\u2212\u03c0(RMP ) ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere eE is the projector on the eigenspace with P0 = E. This will reproduce the\nprobability computed from the thermal density matrix for P0 if\n2\n\ne\u03c0(RMP ) \u2212E/TdS\nTr eE =\n.\nTr e\u2212P0 /TdS\n\n(3.3)\n\nThis relation between the Poincar\u00e9 eigenvalue and the entropy deficit is valid to leading\nM\norder in R(M\n2 for Schwarzschild de Sitter black holes of mass M. We view this as\nP)\nanother piece of semi-classical evidence for the picture advanced here.\nThe commutator between H and P0 has the form\nX\n[H, P0 ] =\n(Ej \u2212 Ei )Hij ,\n(3.4)\nwhere Hij is the rectangular block of H with rows in the ith and columns in the jth\nc\n,\neigenspace of P0 . The individual matrix elements in any of the Hij are bounded by 2\u03c0R\nbut most of them are much smaller than this. In particular the QFTCST claim that the\neffects of H dynamics look like thermal fluctuations in the thermal P0 ensemble, tell us\nthat matrix elements connecting huge Ei \u2212 Ej difference are exponentially suppressed.\nThe spectrum of P0 is bounded by the Nariai black hole mass, which is of order RMP2 3 .\n3\n\nNote that black holes are not eigenstates of P0 . However, this is a bound on the energy of the\ndecay products. For black hole masses much smaller than the Nariai mass these decay products can\nbe captured by the static observer and might have a lifetime much longer than that of the black hole.\nThe decay of this bound but not gravitationally collapsed system back to the dS vacuum is probably\nnot encoded in the operator P0 , but only in H. The captured decay products could be in eigenstates\nof P0\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fIn [9] one of the authors postulated the commutation relation between these two\noperators to be a finite dimensional approximation to [H, P0 ] \u223c R1 P0 . This was motivated by the way the asymptotic Killing vectors of Minkowski space act on the dS\nhorizon. The general considerations above show that the commutator is small but do\nnot point to this specific form.\n\n4. Black holes from fermionic matrices\nThis section is meant to replace a somewhat confused discussion in [9]. The metric\nof the Schwarzschild dS black hole has the same form as the static patch metric with\nr2\n2M\nf (r) \u2192 (1 \u2212 rM\n2 \u2212 R2 ). This has two horizons, which are at the positive roots of\nP\n\nr 3 \u2212 rR2 +\n\n2MR2\n= 0.\nMP2\n\nWe write this as\n2\n2\nR2 = R+\n+ R\u2212\n+ R+ R\u2212 ,\n\n(4.1)\n\n2MR2 = R+ R\u2212 (R+ + R\u2212 )MP2 .\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe entropy deficit of the black hole state, taking into account both cosmological and\nblack hole horizons, is\n\u2206S = \u03c0R+ R\u2212 MP2 .\n(4.3)\nWe match the entropy of our fermionic Hilbert space to that of dS space by\n\u03c0(RMP )2 = 4N 2 ln 2.\n\n(4.4)\n\nAll such formulae are to be understood only in the large N limit. In order to find\ncandidate black hole states, we choose two integers related to R\u00b1 by the same formula\n\u03c0(R\u00b1 MP )2 = 4N\u00b12 ln 2.\n\n(4.5)\n\nWe do this by choosing an integer N\u2212 \u2264 \u221a13 N, and defining N+ to be the closest\ninteger to the solution of\nN 2 = N+2 + N\u22122 + N+ N\u2212 ,\n(4.6)\nsatisfying the constraint\nN+ \u2265 N\u2212 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nNow choose N\u2212 rows and N+ columns of the fermionic matrix \u03c8iA and define the black\nhole states with Schwarzschild radius N\u2212 to be those annihilated by \u03c8iA for the chosen\nrows and columns. The reader is encouraged to think of the choice of a particular set\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fof N\u2212 rows and N+ columns as analogous to the choice of a particular static coordinate\nsystem. Note for example that as N\u22122 gets large, and approaches its maximum value,\nN2\n, one cannot independently choose to construct black hole states for arbitrary choices\n3\nof rows and columns. We will have more to say about the way that different horizon\nvolumes are embedded in the index space of the fermionic matrices when we discuss\nparticle states below.\nWe can reproduce the black hole mass formula 4.2 by writing\nr\n\u221a\nln2\nP0 =\nMP (N 2 \u2212 2N ) N 2 \u2212 N .\n(4.8)\n2\u03c0\nHere, N is the total fermion number operator. This formula is \"coordinate invariant\",\nin the sense that it makes no reference to the particular choice of rows and columns.\nThe black hole states we have defined are all eigenstates of this operator, but not all\nwith the same eigenvalue. However, for large N, the average value of P0 in the ensemble\nof all black hole states is indeed the classical black hole mass, and the fluctuations in\nthis ensemble go to zero like a power of N. We make the further rule that, when\nspeaking of a particular horizon volume we only look at states with a particular choice\nof N\u2212 rows and N+ columns.\nA puzzling feature of the fermionic formulation is that one could consider similar\nstates with arbitrary choice of N+ independent of N\u2212 . This is perhaps related to black\nholes with angular momentum, but we have not yet studied the angular momentum\nproperties of these states.\nWhile the operator P0 realizes the relation between entropy and energy that we\ndescribed in the previous section, it is far from the exact Hamiltonian characterizing\nquantum dS space. We view it as the asymptotic darkness[10] approximation to that\nHamiltonian, in which only black hole spectra are treated, and black holes are exactly\nstable. We will have to modify the Hamiltonian in order to describe black hole decay,\nand the particle states they decay into. It is to the second part of this task that we\nnow turn.\n\n5. Particles from fermionic matrices\nBefore embarking on this task, we should recall the extent to which physics in dS space\ncan be described in terms of particles. We begin our analysis, faute de mieux with\nquantum field theory, though we will see below that there is a more elegant description\navailable. Our question is: How much of the entropy of dS space can be understood in\nterms of particles? and it was answered in [11]. The entropy of quantum field theory\nis dominated by high energy states, and the high energy behavior of a quantum field\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\ftheory is conformally invariant. The entropy of a cutoff conformal field theory in a\nvolume of linear size R scales like\n\u039b3c R3 ,\nwhere \u039bc is the momentum cutoff. A typical state in this ensemble has energy of order\n\u039b4c R3 < MP2 R,\nwhere the inequality is the requirement that the Schwarzschild radius of the state be\nless than the dS horizon radius. This implies that the cutoff is very low\nr\nMP\n\u039bc <\n.\nR\nOne should understand that this is not the limit on the momentum of individual particles in isolation, but only of particle belonging to the maximal entropy ensemble. Our\nactual description of particles in dS space will have the tradeoff between the momenta\nof individual particles, and the total allowed number of particles, built in to it. With\nthis cutoff, the total field theory entropy is of order (RMP )3/2 . In [11] the authors suggested that this counting allows us to understand the QFTCST picture of dS space as\na system which (at asymptotically late or early times) has an infinite number of independent horizon volumes, each described by cutoff field theory. Our counting suggests\nthat the number of independent field theoretic subsystems is finite, of order (RMP )1/2 ,\nbut becomes infinite in the small c.c. limit where QFTCST is supposed to be a good\napproximation.\nWe now proceed to present our model in more detail. The holographic formulation\nof quantum gravity in de Sitter space we want to put forward is expected, in the\n\u039b \u2192 0 limit, to recover 4d N = 1 Super-Poincar\u00e9 physics. At the kinematical level,\nwe expect to recover something akin to Ashtekar's formalism for asymptotically flat\nspacetime at null infinity [14]. For 4d Minkowski space, null infinity is (u, \u03a9), where\nu is a null coordinate and \u03a9 parameterizes a two sphere. The conformal group of the\nsphere is SO(1, 3), which is identified as the Lorentz transformations. However, as we\nwill see below, the kinematical theory of dS space does not lead to a field theoretic\nformalism on null infinity. Rather, in close analogy with Matrix Theory, we obtain a\ndirect description of multi-particle states from a theory of matrices.\nTo set the stage, we discuss the formulation of SUSY algebra and SUSY multiplets\nof N = 1 at null infinity. First, we will show that the 4 independent solutions to\nthe Conformal Killing spinor equation for S 2 provide a realization of the minimal\nsupersymmetry algebra in 4d for massless multiplets. The conformal Killing spinor\nequation is\nD\u03bc q (\u03b1) = \u03b3i ei\u03bc \u03bb(\u03b1) .\n(5.1)\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fIn the usual angular coordinates on the two sphere, the zweibein has non-vanishing\ncomponents\ne1\u03b8 = 1, e2\u03c6 = sin\u03b8.\n(5.2)\nIn the representation where the two dimensional Euclidean Dirac matrices are \u03c31,2 , the\nspinor covariant derivatives are\nD\u03b8 = \u2202\u03b8 ,\n\ni\nD\u03c6 = \u2202\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c33 cos\u03b8.\n2\n\nFour linearly independent solutions of the CKS equation are\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221a\n0\n1\ni\u03c6/2\nq = i 1 \u2212 cos\u03b8e\n,\n1\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221a\n0\n2\n\u2212i\u03c6/2\nq = \u2212i 1 + cos\u03b8e\n,\n1\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221a\n1\ni\u03c6/2\n3\n,\nq = 1 + cos\u03b8e\n0\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212i\u03c6/2\n4\n.\nq = 1 \u2212 cos\u03b8e\n0\n\n(5.3)\n\n(5.4)\n(5.5)\n(5.6)\n(5.7)\n\nThese satisfy\n(q \u2020 )\u03b1 q \u03b2 = (\u03b3 0 \u03b3 \u03bc )\u03b1\u03b2 P\u0302 \u03bc ,\n\n(5.8)\n\nwith the Weyl representation of the SO(1, 3) Dirac matrices. Here\nP\u0302 \u03bc = (1, sin \u03b8cos \u03c6, sin \u03b8sin \u03c6, cos \u03b8).\n\n(5.9)\n\nBelow we will argue that K \u00d7 K + 1 fermionic matrices \u03c8iA , converge as K goes to\ninfinity to operator valued linear functionals on the space of measurable sections of the\nspinor bundle of the two sphere. For two sections fa , ga , the commutation relations are\n[S[f ], S[g]]+ = pfa ga ,\nwhere p is a positive real number we will explain below. It follows that\n[S[q \u03b1 ], S[q \u03b2 ]]+ = (\u03b3 0 \u03b3 \u03bc )\u03b1\n\nbeta\n\nP\u03bc .\n\nWe now recall that any CPT-invariant massless multiplet of N = 1 d = 4 SUSY\ncontains states with 4 helicities: m, m \u2212 1/2, \u2212m + 1/2, \u2212m. At null infinity, these\nstates are sections over S 2 line bundles with the corresponding charges. The charge of\na line bundle is one half the power of the positive chirality spinor bundle which realizes\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fit. This is the description of asymptotically flat N = 1 d = 4 kinematic framework\nwe aim to recover in the \u039b \u2192 0 limit of deSitter space. Coming back to deSitter, at\nfinite N, the S 2 sphere at null infinity is substituted by a fuzzy sphere, and the S 2 line\nbundle of charge m is substituted by a module, a vector space of N \u00d7(N +2m) matrices\n[15]. Our main claim is this section is that we can take blocks of Grassmann variables,\nsuch that, in the limit their size goes to infinity, the 4 sections of a supermultiplet are\nrecovered4 .\nOur proposal for the chiral multiplet, m = 1/2, uses the coherent state representation of the operator algebra of the variables \u03c8iA . The Hilbert space consists of functions\nof a Grassmann variable ziA , i = 1, . . . , p, A = 1, . . . , p + 1 as a p \u00d7 (p + 1) matrix, with\nthe usual Berezin inner product. As in Matrix Theory, we mean arbitrary functions of\nthe matrix elements.\nNow introduce\nna \u2261 z T Jpa z\n(5.10)\nand\na\nN a \u2261 zJp+1\nzT ,\n\n(5.11)\n\na\nwhere J2l+1\nare the 2l+1 dimensional representation of the angular momentum matrices.\nThe space of all holomorphic Grassmann functions of z decomposes into four subspaces,\nwhich are of the form\nzf1 (na )\n(5.12)\n\nf2 (na ),\nf3 (N a ),\nz T f4 (N a ).\nIn these formula, the functions fi are matrix polynomials. For example, the general\nP\nform of f2 is\nca1 ...ak na1 . . . nak , where the products are p + 1 \u00d7 p + 1 matrix products.\nOur claim is that every function of the matrix elements takes one of these four forms.\nThat is, the matrix elements of these four kinds of matrix fill out the space of all\nfunctions of the matrix elements of ziA in a one to one fashion.\nNote that the differences between the numbers of rows and columns in these four\nsubspaces are 1,0,0,-1, as appropriate for the modules of the four sections of the m = 1/2\n4\n\nOur discussion here bears some relation to that of [13]. We suspect that the relation between their\nframework and ours is similar to that between Hilbert spaces of gauge theories before and after fixing\n3\ngauge constraints: in their Hilbert space, with dimension growing like eR , not all degrees of freedom\nare simultaneously physical. After one chooses a holographic screen (\"fixes the gauge\"), the reduced\n2\nHilbert space has dimension eR , as ours has.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fsupermultiplet. The fi are all power series in their respective matrix variables. The\npower series all truncate, because z is a Grassmann variable.\nOur conjecture is that, one can take the p \u2192 \u221e limit, in such a way that these four\nsubspaces of the Hilbert space converge to the space of L2 sections of four line bundles\nover the two sphere. This conjecture is motivated by the way in which the fuzzy sphere\nconverges to the sphere, but has the following additional features.\n\u2022 na and N a are bilinears in Grassmann variables. This should become irrelevant as\np \u2192 \u221e because these combinations involve infinite sums of Grassmann bilinears\nand so all of the vanishing relations in the Grassmann algebra only come in very\nhigh order products. The L2 sections involve sums of finite monomials in these\nvariables (generalized spherical harmonics) with coefficients converging to zero\nrapidly with the order of the monomial.\n\u2022 Conventionally one takes a limit of the fuzzy sphere which produces a spherical\ngeometry with finite radius. Here we want to make the radius infinite and obtain\nobjects which depend only on the conformal equivalence class of the geometry.\nThe conformal group of the sphere is SO(1, 3), which is identified with the Lorentz\ntransformations.\n\u2022 As a consequence, wave functions will depend on a variable p \u2208 R+ , a continuous\nlimit of the discrete p. The continuous p will rescale under conformal transformations of the sphere [14][8].\nIf this conjecture is correct, then our limiting single particle Hilbert space will be\nthat of the massless chiral supermultiplet. We will realize different particles in terms\nof disjoint K \u00d7 K + 1 blocks of the N \u00d7 N + 1 matrix \u03c8iA . The ratios of matrix sizes\nfor different particles take all real positive values in the limit, so we can parametrize\nthe size of a given matrix by a positive real number p5 . The real linear combinations\nof the operators \u03c8iA and their adjoints converge to linear functionals (operator valued\nmeasures) Sa (\u03a9, p) on the space of measurable sections of the real spinor bundle over\nthe two sphere. The commutation relations are\n[S[f ], S[g]]+ = pfa ga ,\nwhere fa (\u03a9) and ga (\u03a9) are any two sections. If we choose qa\u03b1 to be the four real\nsolutions of the CKS equation (linear combinations of the solutions described above),\n5\n\nWe are actually describing a limit in which the matrices become elements of the hyperfinite II\u221e\nfactor, as in [8].\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fthen Q\u03b1 = S[q \u03b1 ] satisfy the SUSY anti-commutation relations for a single massless\nsuperparticle with momentum p(1, \u03a9) .\nOur explicit construction leads directly to the chiral multiplet. Bundles on the two\nsphere of charge k (2k is the power of the positive chirality spinor bundle) are obtained\nfrom fuzzy modules of N \u00d7 N + 2k matrices. We do not see how to obtain these while\nsimultaneously enforcing the requirement that the operators \u03c8 converge to something\nthat transforms in the spinor bundle.\nWhen discussing representations of the massless SUSY algebra in four dimensions,\none is similarly led most naturally to the chiral multiplet. One simply appends a\nphase to the transformation law of the states in order to describe higher spin massless\nmultiplets. It is possible that one can construct a similar argument for the present\nsystem, but we do not see how to obtain this from a natural finite N construction.\nOne way to do it is to insist that the pixel degrees of freedom actually correspond to\nfull 32 component spinors, and satisfy a version of the massless SUSY anticommutation\nrelations of 11D SUGRA in the presence of central charges. Then one representation\nwill always contain the graviton. Since we start from a holographic description of the\ntheory, it is reasonable to assume that it will only be sensible as a dynamical theory,\nif it contains a graviton. If there is no quick and dirty way, like that alluded to in the\npreceding paragraph, to model higher helicities then we would find that our formalism\nonly makes sense if we model four dimensional space-time as a compactification of\nString/M Theory. Of course, a lot more work needs to be done, before we could make\nsuch a grandiose claim.\nHaving dealt with single particle states, we turn to multiparticle states. The basic\nidea is to consider block decompositions of the full N \u00d7 (N + 1) matrix, where by the\nprevious argument, each individual block corresponds to a single particle. We take the\nblock sizes 1 \u226a pi \u226a N and take N and all pi to infinity, with pi /pj fixed.\nIn particular, let's consider the following block decomposition\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n2 ...\nK\n\uf8ec K 1 ... K \u2212 1\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(5.13)\n... \uf8f7\n\u03c8=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8ec... ... ...\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed... ... ...\n...\n2\n3 ...\n1\n\u221a\nwhere K \u223c N . We associate the degrees of freedom labeled by a given integer 1 \u2264 p \u2264\nK with a single independent horizon volume. Note that, if we follow the hint from our\nblack hole discussion, and treat exchanges of indices on \u03c8 as a gauge equivalence, then\nthe different horizon volumes are equivalent to each other. Furthermore, the different\nblocks in a given horizon volume are indistinguishable, in the sense that permutations\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fof their order is just a relabeling. As in Matrix Theory[12], we will treat this as the\ngauge symmetry of particle statistics.\nWe are free to vary the individual block sizes in a given horizon volume, but if we\nwant to maximize the entropy, with the proviso that there be many individual\nparticles,\n\u221a\nwe should take the blocks to be approximately square, with K \u223c N rows. If we do\nthis, all horizon volumes are indeed treated equally. If we try to increase an individual\nblock size to be \u226b K, then we simultaneously squeeze out degrees of freedom in other\nhorizons, and constrain the allowed states of particles in our own horizon volume.\nThus, the idea that localized entropy in a given horizon volume is \"borrowed\" from\nthe horizon, an idea which originates in the black hole entropy formula, becomes quite\nexplicit in this construction. When we make such a large block, a description of the\nsystem in terms of black holes becomes more appropriate. We begin to see the vague\noutlines of a unified description of black hole and particle states, and their interactions6\nThe natural unit for this discrete momentum, is R1 , the minimal momentum that\nfits inside a horizon volume. The maximal momentum\nfor\n\u221a\npparticles in our maximal\nN\nentropy configuration, with block size K, is of order R \u223c MP /R in agreement with\nour field theory estimate. However, unlike field theory, our formalism allows us to\ntake individual particle momenta much larger than this, at the expense of making the\nmomenta of other particles smaller, or reducing the total number of particles.\nUsing only the degrees of freedom in a single horizon (corresponding to a single\ninteger label in our block decomposition), we can make a maximal block size of order\nN 3/4 , which would appear to give a maximal momentum of order (RMP )\u22121/4 MP (in\nthe real world this would be a few TeV). However, this is not the only way to make\nhigh momentum particles. Our formalism describes particles by the way in which they\nregister on the holographic screen at infinity. As we will see in a moment, particles of\nhigher momentum, defined by full blocks of size J \u226b K, have higher angular resolution\non the screen. The full set of degrees of freedom in a block of size J describes superparticles whose angular wave function can be roughly any one of the first J spherical\nharmonics. Thus, these operators can describe of order J particles, with the same\nabsolute value of the momentum RJ (1, \u03a9). If we only need to describe a few particles\nwith high momentum, we can use smaller blocks, but with\n\u221a the wave functions \"locked\ntogether\". Thus, if we only use K blocks of size K \u223c N but insist on states with\nexactly the same angular wave function in each block, we are describing the amplitude\nfor a pixel in the detector on the holoscreen to absorb momentum MP . From the point\nof view of scattering theory this is interpreted as a single particle with momentum MP\n. Perhaps, in analogy with Matrix Theory, it should be viewed as a bound state of the\n6\n\nWe have to admit that it is rather too vague for our taste at the moment.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fparticles associated with individual blocks. Note that, in contrast to Matrix theory,\nthere is no way to talk about particles at finite separation in the kinematics we are\ndiscussing here. So the concept of a bound state does not have an obvious meaning in\nthis context. In a similar manner, we could try to describe particles with momentum\nup to (RMP )1/2 MP as bound states of N 3/2 blocks of size \u223c 1. These would be forced\ninto a an almost unique angular wave function, consisting of only the first few spherical harmonics. The description of particles in our formalism is thus flexible, and the\nnumber of particles and their allowed four momentum wave functions are constrained\nin a complicated and mutual way.\nWe end this section with a remark about the emergent SU(2) group of three\ndimensional rotations in the limiting asymptotically flat theory, which we obtain as\n(RMP ) \u2192 \u221e. It is not the same as the SU(2) group of the static observer, under\nwhich the full fermionic matrix transforms as the [N \u2297 N + 1]. Our entire formalism\nwas built on the hypothesis that the Poincar\u00e9 Hamiltonian P0 was a very different\noperator from the static Hamiltonian H. Now we see that the same is true for the\nrotation group.\n\n6. Finite N corrections\nIf our mathematical conjecture about the limiting space of Grassman wave functions is\ncorrect, then we have isolated the kinematic degrees of freedom of particle physics from\na formulation of the quantum theory of dS space, which has a finite number of states.\nWe could then hope to get some insight about the finite c.c. corrections to particle\nphysics observables. In particular, it is plausible that the super-Poincar\u00e9 commutation\nrelation\n[P\u03bc , Q\u03b1 ] = 0,\n(6.1)\n(with P\u03bc defined, as above, by the SUSY anticommutation relation) is not valid at finite\nN.\nIn order to describe the spectrum of particles at a given mass scale m, we should\nwork with particles described as fermionic matrices of size (mR). It is clear from the\nabove discussion that unless (mR) \u226b 1, we cannot hope to obtain a description which\napproximates particles moving in flat space. This remark shows that our formalism\ncannot describe gravitinos obeying the classical SUGRA relation m3/2 \u223c R1 , which arises\nfrom requiring that the c.c. not look fine tuned in the low energy effective field theory\nsense. This argument alone cannot fix the dependence of m3/2 on R, but the most\nsymmetric treatment of particles in this system uses blocks of size N 1/2 . Thus one\nmight expect corrections to SUSY degeneracies of order N \u22121/2 , which suggests m3/2 \u223c\n(R/MP )\u22121/2 \u223c \u039b1/4 , as conjectured in [6].\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\f7. Conclusions\nWe have presented a kinematic framework for the quantum theory of de Sitter space,\nand identified configurations of the fundamental variables which could represent both\nblack hole and particle states. Much remains to be done in order to develop this into\na full blown theory. We list the most salient points:\n\u2022 We must prove the conjecture that our finite dimensional particle Hilbert space\nconverges to the usual Fock space of superparticles.\n\u2022 We must understand how to describe compactified internal dimensions and the\nspectrum of non-gravitational supermultiplets. Indeed, in the limit N \u2192 \u221e we\nexpect our model to have an S-matrix which is super-Poincar\u00e9 invariant, and is\nlikely to be closely related to well understood string and M theory constructions.\nWe might hope, e.g. that the limiting model will have an approximate description\nas 11D SUGRA compactified on a manifold of G2 holonomy with values of the\nmoduli frozen at an R symmetric point. We need a kinematic description of such\na compactification in terms of fermionic matrices.\n\u2022 Most importantly, we need to formulate dynamical equations which determine\nthe scattering matrix and the object which approximates it for finite N.\nThe first two of these desiderata seem within reach, while the third remains somewhat mysterious. One of the authors has suggested possible avenues of attack on the\ndynamical problem in [8].\n\n8. Appendix\nIn this brief appendix, we indicate how to prove the conjectures we made about random Hamiltonians. These results were explained to us by Mark Srednicki. We want to\nstudy random Hamiltonians whose spectrum is bounded between [0, Eb ], where we will\neventually take Eb to be of order the dS temperature. Most studies refer to Hamiltonians chosen from a Gaussian random ensemble. We will assume that similar results are\nvalid for our case.\nGiven such a Hamiltonian, and in the limit of a large Hilbert space, one can show\nthat the time averaged expectation values of a class of observables converge to the\nexpectation values in a thermal ensemble[16]. The necessary constraint on observables\nhas to do with their matrix elements in the basis where the Hamiltonian matrix elements\nare Gaussian random variables.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fThe temperature of the thermal ensemble is related to the center of the small\nenergy band that is allowed in the eigenbasis expansion of the initial state. It is thus\ndetermined by the expectation value of the energy in the initial state.\nThis expectation value is\nX\n\n|ai |2 Ei .\n\nWe now want to average this over all possible initial states. The measure is the unitary\ninvariant measure on the unit sphere in our finite dimensional Hilbert space,\nX\n\u03b4(1 \u2212\n|ai |2 ).\n\u22121\n\nP\n\n|ai |2\n\n. We can compute\nFor large N this can be replaced by the Gaussian measure e 2 Z\nexpectation values and fluctuations using Wick's theorem. The expectation value is\nthe average eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian, and the fluctuations in this quantity as\nwe run over the ensemble of states is N1 . Since the energy scale is set by Eb for any\nsmooth measure with support on the interval, this will also be the scale of the average\ntemperature. We choose Eb so that the temperature is precisely the dS temperature.\nRecall that in the dS case, N is an enormously large number. For our own universe it\n120\nwould be e10 .\nThus, assuming that random Hamiltonians with a fixed upper and lower bound\nthermalize generic states, we have proven the claims in the text.\n\n9.
