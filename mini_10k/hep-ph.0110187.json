The topic of this paper is to study how\naccurately we can determine the supernova direction. We simulate supernova neutrino\nevents at the SuperKamiokande detector, using a realistic supernova model and several\nrealistic neutrino oscillation models. With the results of our simulation, we can restrict\nthe supernova direction to be within a circle of radius 9\u25e6 . In several neutrino oscillation\nmodels, this accuracy is increased to 8\u25e6 . We also discuss the influence of an accident\nthat occurred at the SuperKamiokande detector. After repair of the detector, using\nthe remaining PMTs, the accuracy becomes about 12\u25e6 for no oscillation.\n\n1\n\n\f\u00a71. Introduction\nIn order to obtain information concerning core-collapse supernova explosions, which are\nrare in the galaxy, 1) it is very important to observe the light curve of its early phase. It is\nexpected that a core-collapse supernova explosion in our galaxy will be detected in the future\nby several neutrino detectors around the world. When a supernova collapse occurs, neutrinos\nproduced in the core can escape immediately, because of their very weak interaction with\nmatter. Contrastingly, photons do not escape until the shock wave travels from the core\nthrough the stellar envelope and breaks out of the stellar photosphere. For this reason,\nwe can receive the neutrino signal several hours earlier than the light signal. (Of course\nthis time delay depends on the size of the envelope. Reference 2) contains a simple model\nof this delay.) In addition, because electromagnetic signals are obscured by dust in the\ninterstellar space, it is plausible that some supernova explosions cannot be detected without\nthe neutrino signal. Therefore, if we could determine the direction of a supernova explosion\nby its neutrinos, many astronomical observations of its early state would be possible. In\nfact, a world-wide early supernova alert project is running (SNEWS, or SuperNova Early\nWarning System). 3), 4)\nThis problem (of determining the direction to a supernova by its neutrinos) has been\nstudied previously in a general manner 5) - 9) . There are two methods to deal with this problem. The first method uses the angular distributions of the neutrino reaction products, which\ncan be correlated with the supernova direction. Among past works following this approach,\nBeacom and Vogel in Ref. 5) evaluated the numerical integral to find the centroid of the\nGaussian peak of the reaction products' distribution, with a known flat background. Their\nresult is \u03b4\u03b8 \u2243 5\u25e6 for SuperKamiokande, and \u03b4\u03b8 \u2243 20\u25e6 for SNO. The second method is based\n\non triangulation using two or more widely-separated detectors. However, this technique was\nshown to be very crude in Ref. 5) (\u03b4 cos \u03b8 \u2243 0.5 for SuperKamiokande and SNO), in contrast\n\nto previous optimistic estimates given in, for example, Ref. 6).\n\nIn this paper, we simulate a supernova explosion in the galactic plane (D = 10 kpc as\nused in Ref. 5), for comparison) and discuss the statistical error in its direction using the\nfirst method mentioned above. This approach, which is based on a more concrete simulation\ncomparing to the past works, is very precise. In addition, we also consider the more realistic\ncase, that of \"neutrino oscillation,\" which is supported by solar 10) - 12) and atmospheric\nneutrino 13) data. This realistic case was not considered in previous works. We expect that\nin the case of neutrino oscillation, the accuracy of the determined supernova direction will\nbe better, since the energy of \u03bde 's, which give the largest contribution in determining the\ndirection, is increased due to the conversion \u03bde \u2194 \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 . (Because \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 's experience only\n2\n\n\fneutral-current reactions in the supernova and interact with matter more weakly than \u03bde 's,\n\u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 's reach equilibrium deeper in the core than \u03bde 's, and their temperatures are higher than\nthose of \u03bde 's.)\nThe construction of this paper is as follows. In \u00a72, a realistic supernova model and\nthe neutrino oscillation models used in the simulation are presented. Reactions at the\nSuperKamiokande detector and these cross sections are discussed in \u00a73. Based on these\nmodels and reactions, we simulated a supernova explosion in our galaxy and events at SuperKamiokande. The results of these simulations are reported in \u00a74. The details of this\nsimulation and its results concerning the accuracy of the direction are also reported in this\nsection. Finally we discuss our results in \u00a75.\n\n\u00a72. Supernova model and oscillation parameters\nWe use a realistic model of a collapse-driven supernova proposed by the Lawrence Livermore group. 14) Time-integrated energy spectra for the case of no oscillation is shown in\nFig. 1. (See Ref. 15) for details.) In this model, however, the radiation of neutrinos is\nisotropic, despite the fact that supernova progenitors are rotating (which many observations\nhave indicated), and they radiate anisotropic neutrinos. 16) For now, we do not consider the\neffect of rotation for simplicity.\nWe use four models of neutrino mixing parameters used in Ref. 17) (see Table I), and the\nresults of the supernova neutrino oscillation given in Ref. 17) are also used. These models are\nmade to agree with the results of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos. 10) - 13) The expressions\n\"LMA\" and \"SMA\" indicate the MSW solution of the solar neutrino problem. A recent SNO\nobservation, 12) along with other observations, shows that the LMA solution is better than\nthe SMA solution, and the SMA solution is not allowed below the 3\u03c3 level (see Ref. 18) and\nreferences therein). However, we also consider the SMA solution for comparison. The suffices\n\"-L\" and \"-S\" attached to \"LMA\" and \"SMA\" indicate whether \u03b813 is large or small, where\n\u03b813 is one of three mixing angles of the neutrino mixing matrix. A large (small) \u03b813 means\nthat the \"higher resonance\" is adiabatic (nonadiabatic). 19) An adiabatic higher resonance\nenhances the energy of the electron neutrinos, and enhances the event rate of \u03bde scattering,\nwhich appears to be strongly correlated with the supernova direction (see below). For a\nreview of the MSW effect, see Ref. 20).\n3\n\n\f\u00a73. Expected events at SuperKamiokande\nSuperKamiokande (SK) is a water \u010cherenkov detector with 32,000 tons of pure water\nlocated at Kamioka, Japan. The relevant interactions of neutrinos with water are as follows:\n\u03bd\u0304e + p \u2192 n + e+ ,\n\n\u03bde + e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bde + e\u2212 ,\n\n\u03bd\u0304e + e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e + e\u2212 ,\n\n(CC)\n\n(3.1)\n\n(CC and NC)\n\n(3.2)\n\n(CC and NC)\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 ) + e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 ) + e\u2212 ,\n\u03bde + O \u2192 F + e\u2212 ,\n\n\u03bd\u0304e + O \u2192 N + e+ ,\n\n(3.4)\n\n(NC)\n\n(CC)\n\n(3.5)\n\n(CC)\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere CC and NC stand for charged current and neutral current interactions, respectively.\nThe efficiency of the SK detector is 100% for an electron whose energy is above 5 MeV\nand 50% at 4.2 MeV. (For the energy and angular resolution of SK, we refer to Ref. 21).)\nThe energy resolution is \u223c 15% for an electron with energy 10 MeV. We display the angular\nresolution as a function of the recoil electron energy in Fig. 2. In this figure, we fitted\nexperimental data to the function 83\u25e6Ee\u22120.5 , where Ee is measured in MeV, which is used in\nour simulation.\nThe differential cross section of the electron scattering (3.2)-(3.4) (for its derivation, see\nRef. 22)), is given by\nd\u03c3\nG2 T 2 (1 + 2me /Te )3/2\n= F e\nd cos \u03b8\n2\u03c0\n1 + me /E\u03bd\n#\n\"\n\u0013\n\u0012\nme Te\nTe 2\n+C 2 ,\n\u00d7 A+B 1\u2212\nE\u03bd\nE\u03bd\ncos \u03b8 =\n\nE\u03bd + me\nE\u03bd\n\n\u0012\n\nTe\nTe + 2me\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n\n,\n\nwhere GF is the Fermi constant, me is the electron mass, Te is the electron kinetic energy,\nE\u03bd is the neutrino energy, and the coefficients A, B, and C are given in Table II. \u03b8 is the\nangle between the injected neutrino and the recoil electron (positron). This differential cross\nsection is highly peaked in the forward direction, as shown in Fig. 3. With a threshold\nenergy (5 MeV), this forward peak is enhanced.\nThe differential cross section of the \u03bd\u0304e p CC reaction (3.1) (see Ref. 23)) is\n\u0393\n\u03c30\nd\u03c3\n(f 2 + 3g 2) + (f 2 \u2212 g 2 ) cos \u03b8 \u2212\nEe(0) Ee(0) ,\n=\nd cos \u03b8\n2\nM\n\u0393 = 2(f + f2 )g[(2Ee(0) + \u2206)(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)]\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n4\n\n(3.9)\n\n\f+ (f 2 + g 2 )[\u2206(1 + cos \u03b8)]\n+ (f 2 + 3g 2 )[3(Ee(0) + \u2206)(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) \u2212 \u2206]\n\n+ (f 2 \u2212 g 2 )[3(Ee(0) + \u2206)(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) \u2212 \u2206] cos \u03b8,\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere f = 1, g = 1.26, and f2 = \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn = 3.706 (with \u03bcp , \u03bcn the magnetic moments of the\n\nproton and a neutron, respectively, in units of the nuclear magneton), M is the nucleon mass,\nand \u2206 is the mass difference between a neutron and a proton. The normalizing constant \u03c30 ,\nincluding the energy-independent inner radiative corrections, is\n\n\u03c30 =\n\nG2F cos2 \u03b8C\n(1 + \u2206R\ninner ),\n\u03c0\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere \u03b8C is the Cabibbo angle (cos \u03b8C = 0.974) and \u2206R\ninner \u2243 0.024. This cross section\n(3.9) is expressed to first order in E\u03bd /M, and depends on the zeroth-order positron energy\nEe(0) = E\u03bd \u2212 \u2206. As shown in Fig. 4, the differential cross section of the \u03bd\u0304e p reaction is almost\nisotropic, and the \u03bd\u0304e p reaction has the largest contribution to the detected events at SK\n[e.g., at E\u03bd = 10 MeV, \u03c3(\u03bd\u0304e p) \u2243 100\u03c3(\u03bde e\u2212 )]. For this reason, it is not easy to see the peak\nposition of events, information about which enables us to determine the supernova direction\neasily.\nThe differential cross sections of the reactions with oxygen (3.5) and (3.6) are unclear,\nbecause of the uncertainty of the the nuclear part. These reactions are important if we\nconsider the case with \"neutrino oscillation,\" because the oscillation enhances the energies\nof \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e , which contribute to the reactions with the oxygen, and therefore enhances the\ncross sections of these reactions. The differential cross sections with oxygen calculated in Ref.\n24) are highly peaked in the backward direction when the neutrino energy becomes larger,\nand therefore the reactions with oxygen seem to be useful for determining the supernova\ndirection. However, the backward peaks of these reactions are not as sharp as the forward\npeaks of the electron scattering reactions. For this reason, we do not consider the reactions\nwith oxygen, because we believe that these reactions influence the result only slightly.\nThe number of events at SK is calculated in Ref. 17) in the case of a supernova explosion\nat D = 10 kpc. We give these results in Table III. (Note that the reactions with oxygen are\nalso shown.)\nWe cannot expect better accuracy for the direction from SNO observation than from SK\nobservation (see Ref. 5), for example), and therefore we do not discuss events at SNO.\n5\n\n\f\u00a74. Simulation and results\nWe assume that a supernova explosion occurred at D = 10 kpc. To obtain information\nabout the direction of the supernova, we have to set the coordinates at SK. Here, we set the\nz-axis in the upward direction, and we use spherical coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6) as follows to determine\nthe direction:\nx = cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6,\n\n(4.1)\n\ny = sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6,\n\n(4.2)\n\nz = cos \u03b8.\n\n(4.3)\n\nWe also assume here that the direction of the supernova is (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (135\u25e6, 270\u25e6 ). In this case,\nthe peak position should be (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (45\u25e6 , 90\u25e6 ). (As we see below, this assumption does not\ninfluence our final results.)\nRecoil electrons and positrons are distributed according to the equations (3.7) and (3.9).\nHowever, they also experience multiple scattering in water, and we understand this effect as\nfollows. An electron or a positron of energy Ee that scatters is characterized by a Gaussian\nprobability distribution, whose center value is the original direction of that electron and\nwhose one sigma error is 83\u25e6 \u00d7 (Ee /MeV)\u22121/2 (as shown in Fig. 2). In addition, another\nfactor that effects SK events is the energy resolution of the detector. However, we do not\nhave to consider the energy resolution, because it represents the accuracy with which the\ndetector can determine the electron energies, and in our simulation we do not investigate\nthe electron energy distribution.\nFirst, we consider the case of \"no oscillation.\" We display in Fig. 5 the distribution of\nthe events for this case. There seems to be an obscure peak around (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (45\u25e6 , 90\u25e6). To\nanalyze this result systematically, we divide the cos \u03b8 direction into 20 bins and sum up in\neach bin. Figure 6 is the result of this operation. The dashed curve in Fig. 6 corresponds to\nthe \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 peaked case, which can easily be calculated theoretically with cross sections. Then,\nwe rotate the coordinates so that the events are seen as in the case that the peak is located\nat \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 using a least-square method. The best-fitted result is shown in Fig. 7. This result\nis obtained at angles (\u03b8bestfit , \u03c6bestfit ) = (47.7\u25e6 , 80.0\u25e6). This result is near the \"true\" values,\n(45\u25e6 , 90\u25e6 ), but this simulation alone is not sufficient to estimate the errors. We, carried out\nthe simulation 1,000 times under the same conditions and obtained a distribution of the\nbest-fitted coordinate rotation angles. We denote by \u03b8SN the angle between these best-fitted\npoints (\u03b8bestfit , \u03c6bestfit ) and the \"true\" point (45\u25e6 , 90\u25e6), and we measure these discrepancies\n\u03b8SN . [We should note that when we analyze using \u03b8SN , the information regarding the original\npeak position, or (45\u25e6 , 90\u25e6), is lost, and our analysis from this point does not depend on\n6\n\n\fwhere the peak position is.] The solid histogram in Fig. 8 is the distribution of the values\ncos \u03b8SN , and we fitted this result to a Gaussian (dashed curve). The one sigma error of\n2\nthis Gaussian is \u03b4 cos \u03b8SN = 0.0130. By using the simple formula \u03b4 cos \u03b8SN \u2243 \u03b4\u03b8SN\n/2, we\nobtain \u03b4\u03b8SN = 9.2\u25e6 . Then in this method we can determine the supernova direction with an\n\naccuracy of 9.2\u25e6 .\nWe adapted the same simulations to the other four \"neutrino oscillation\" cases. We\nsummarize these results in Table IV.\n\n\u00a75. Discussion\nAs shown in Table IV, we can determine the supernova direction within \u223c 10\u25e6 . In the\nfive models with which we have dealt in this paper, \"LMA-L\" and \"SMA-L\" are the best,\nbecause the electron scattering events are more prominent for them, as shown in Table III.\nNow we give further discussion of three points below, where we assume the case of \"no\noscillation.\"\n5.1. Oxygen events\nAs discussed above and shown in Table III, we must consider the oxygen events, especially\nin the case of \"neutrino oscillation.\" We do not expect that these effects will enable us to\ndetermine the direction more accurately than in the no oscillation case. Rather, because\ntheir reaction cross sections are unclear, they may complicate our analyses by acting as\nnoise.\nIf we would like to determine the supernova direction without the oxygen, whose effect\nis very complicated, one method is to include an \"energy cut-off.\" For example, we only\nconsider electrons whose energies are less than 15 MeV, so that oxygen events should have\nlittle contribution. (However, we cannot be sure that an energy cut-off of 15 MeV is sufficient\nto accomplish this.) With this energy cut-off, we carried out simulations in the same manner.\nFor the result obtained in this case, the accuracy is rather worse, \u03b4\u03b8SN \u223c 13\u25e6 . This is because\n\nlower energy electrons (positrons) are scattered in the detector, and this makes the angular\nresolution of these electrons (positrons) worse, as shown in Fig. 2.\n5.2. Dependence on distance\n\nThe simulation and its results given above are based on the assumption that the supernova\nexploded at a distance D = 10 kpc. Since the event number at the earth falls off as the\n\u221a\ndistance D squared, N \u221d D \u22122 , and the accuracy \u03b4\u03b8SN is proportional to 1/ N , we expect\n7\n\n\fthat the accuracy is proportional to the distance, or,\n\n\u03b4\u03b8SN = 9.2\n\n\u25e6\n\n!\n\nD\n.\n10 kpc\n\n(5.1)\n\nActually, we carried out simulations assuming other distance (D = 5, 7.5, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20\nkpc) and obtained approximately the same results as above equation.\n\n5.3. After the accident of SuperKamiokande\nOn November 12th, 2001, an accident occurred at the SuperKamiokande detector, and a\nsignificant part (about 60% of the PMTs) of the detector was damaged. The Superkamiokande\ndetector is expected to restart within a year or so, by rearranging the PMTs, whose number\ndensity is reduced by a half, using the existing resources, and using the same volume of\nwater as before. After this repair, the effect of the accident on its performance is expected\nnot to be serious for supernova neutrinos, because the fiducial volume will not change, and\nthe threshold energy change (from 5 MeV to about 7-8 MeV) 25) influences the event number\nvery little, since the low energy event number is small. (For example, the total event number of electron scattering and the inverse \u03b2 decay reaction is 8,318 for a threshold of 5 MeV\nand is 8,165 for a threshold of 8 MeV, based on the calculation of Ref. 17).) The energy\nresolution will be rather large, but this is not a serious problem, since it is proportional to\nsquare root of the number of PMTs. 25)\nFor analysis of the direction, the detector performance is not changed significantly by the\nchange in the detector. The reason for this is as follows. First, since the fiducial volume does\nnot change, the total event number decreases, only because of the higher energy threshold.\nThis effect is very small, as shown above. Second, the angular resolution of the detector,\nwhich is most important in determining the accuracy, is affected little because the higher\nenergy threshold cuts low energy electrons (positrons), which mainly obscure the peak. For\nthese reasons, the angular resolution is not strongly affected, and therefore neither is the\naccuracy in determining the supernova direction.\nActually, our simulation with threshold 8 MeV gives \u03b4\u03b8SN = 11.9\u25e6 . This difference comes\nmainly from the relative smallness of the electron scattering events. But this effect cancels\nwith the higher angular resolution, discussed as the second reason above, and results in the\nsmall difference 2.7\u25e6 .\nWe expect that the SuperKamiokande detector will be repaired soon.\n8\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the staff at SuperKamiokande, including Y.
