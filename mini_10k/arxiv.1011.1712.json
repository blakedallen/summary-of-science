It has been found that Sgr A\u2217 emits radiation from radio through X-rays (see\nMelia & Falcke 2001; Melia 2007, for review) and even TeV \u03b3-rays (Tsuchiya et al. 2004;\nKosack et al. 2004; Aharonian et al. 2004; Albert et al. 2006). The bolometric luminosity\nof Sgr A\u2217 is \u223c 1036 erg s\u22121 and the emission is dominated by radio. The spectral flux sharply\nfalls off above \u03bd \u223c 1012 Hz (\"the submillimeter bump\") (Zylka et al. 1995; Falcke et al.\n1998). In the quiescent state, X-rays at low luminosities were also observed by Chandra,\nwhich obtained the X-ray luminosity of LX \u2248 2.4 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 in the 2 \u2013 10 keV band\n(Baganoff et al. 2003). The quiescent state of Sgr A\u2217 can be described by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model (Yuan et al. 2003) or a jet model (Falcke & Markoff\n2000). These models ascribe the submillimeter bump to synchrotron radiation by thermal\nelectrons in magnetic fields of \u223c 30 G. The X-ray emission in the quiescent state is explained\neither by bremsstrahlung or by inverse Compton scattering in both RIAF (Yuan et al. 2003)\nand the jet models (Falcke & Markoff 2000).\nStrong flares occur frequently in the X-ray band (Baganoff et al. 2001) and nearinfrared (NIR) band (Genzel et al. 2003). The detailed properties of the flares of NIR\nand X-rays are reviewed in Dodds-Eden et al. (2009). X-ray and NIR flares occur simultaneously, with no significant delay (Eckart et al. 2004; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2006). X-ray\nflares are always accompanied by NIR flares, although NIR flares may occur without an\nassociated X-ray flare (e.g., Hornstein et al. 2007). It should be noted, however, that this\nmight be instrumental, because the X-ray background in the Galactic center is proportionally larger than the NIR background and, thus, only bright X-ray flares are detected. The\nduration of NIR flare in the L\u2032 band (3.80 \u03bcm) observed in 2007 April 4 was about 100\nminutes (Dodds-Eden et al. 2009). Simultaneously, XMM-Newton observed the flare in the\nX-ray band and the X-ray flare lasted about 60 minutes (Porquet et al. 2008). The L\u2032 -band\nlight curve of the 2007 flare has sub-structural variations on a timescale of \u223c 20 minutes.\nDodds-Eden et al. (2009) attribute the NIR substructure to the fluctuation of the magnetic\nfield.\nObservations of polarization of the IR flares are broadly consistent with that the IR flares\nare synchrotron origin (e.g., Eckart et al. 2006a; Marrone et al. 2008; Dodds-Eden et al.\n2009; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2009). On the other hand, the emission mechanisms of the Xray flares are still debated; upscattering of submillimeter photons (Markoff et al. 2001;\nYusef-Zadeh et al. 2006), synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scattering (Yuan et al. 2003;\nEckart et al. 2004, 2006a,b; Sabha et al. 2010), synchrotron emission from high energy\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nelectrons (Yuan et al. 2003, 2004; Dodds-Eden et al. 2009), or inverse Compton scattering\nof NIR photons by \u223c 10 MeV electrons responsible for the quiescent radio-millimeter emission\n(Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2009). An orbiting hot spot model is also proposed (Broderick & Loeb\n2005, 2006). This model requires the synchrotron cooling time longer than the orbital period\nto explain the light curve of NIR. However, the cooling time of X-ray emitting electrons is\nmuch shorter than the NIR emitting electrons. This makes the hot spot model inappropriate\nto the X-ray flare emission.\nDodds-Eden et al. (2009) explored the emission mechanisms of the 2007 IR/X-ray flare\nby various synchrotron and inverse Compton emission models. According to their model,\nSSC models need a large magnetic field such as 6000 G and a very small size of the flare\nemission region, e.g., \u223c 0.0013RS, where RS is the Schwarzschild radius. The magnetic field\nis too large compared with the inferred value during the quiescent state, i.e., 10 - 30 G, and\nthe size is too small to account for the flare timescale of 100 minutes. On the other hand, the\nflare is well explained by \"powerlawcool\" model, in which electrons with a power law with a\ncooling break emit IR and X-rays by synchrotron radiation. Recently, Sabha et al. (2010)\nexplored SSC models that include parameter regions not considered by Dodds-Eden et al.\n(2009). Their model also requires a smaller source component size to give a sufficient inverse\nCompton scattering efficiency, so that multi-components are needed to obtain a broad time\nprofile of a flare. Marrone et al. (2008) also constructed a SSC model of X-ray emission for\na flare observed in 2006 July 17. The source size of their model is \u223c RS and the strength of\nmagnetic fields is 1.5 G. The source size and the magnetic fields are smaller than those of\nour model by a factor \u223c 10 as shown in Section 3.\nBecause the origin of X-ray emission is still unclear as described above, in this paper we\npresent a model that NIR and X-ray flares can be produced by synchrotron radiation from\na single plasma blob. The simultaneity of NIR and X-ray flares favors a model of emission\nfrom a single region. The blob might be ejected from the region near the central black hole.\nAs shown below, the size of the blob of our model is about 10 RS and magnetic field is\nabout 20 G. These values are consistent with the physical parameters of the accretion flow\naround the central black hole. In this model the flare duration is determined by the injection\ntimescale of nonthermal electrons. The decay of the flares is owing to the radiative cooling\nand particle escape after turnoff of the injection of nonthermal electrons. In particular, we\nfocus on the time-dependent behavior of the flare models. Because of various timescales such\nas cooling, injection, escape, etc., time-dependent simulations are necessary to investigate\nthe flare properties in detail. It should be noted that most of the previous theoretical work\non the flare emission has been restricted to the steady state models.\nAlthough we do not consider adiabatic expansion in this paper, there are phenomena\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nsuggesting the effects of adiabatic expansion. For example, Hornstein et al. (2007) found\nthat their NIR measurements are consistent with a constant spectral index during a flare.\nMarrone et al. (2008) and Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2009), on the other hand, found that millimeter and submillimeter peaks delay the peak of NIR/X-ray flares. According to their\nmodels this delay is consistent with the adiabatic expansion of a self-absorbed source. The\nestimated expansion speed is much less than 0.1c.\nOur assumptions on the emission region are described in Section 2. Numerical results\nare given in Section 3. A summary of our results and discussion are given in Section 4.\nThroughout this paper, we assume 8 kpc as a Galactic center distance (Eisenhauer et al.\n2003) and 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 as the central black hole mass (Ghez et al. 2008; Gillessen et al.\n2009a,b).\n\n2.\n\nBlob Model\n\nWe first assume that the emission region of the flares is a blob ejected from the central region around the black hole, e.g., from accretion flow (Wang, et al. 2000; Wang & Kusunose\n2002; Yuan et al. 2009). For simplicity of numerical calculations, we assume that the blob\nis a uniform sphere with radius R and magnetic field B. While RIAF or a jet supplies the\nquiescent component of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of radiation, mainly in radio,\nthe temporal ejection of a blob produces flare emission. Since the blob is launched from the\ninner edge or near the inner edge of the accretion flow, the blob speed might be at least\nmildly relativistic. However, we assume that the blob moves at nonrelativistic speed, so that\nthe relativistic effects such as beaming are neglected. Because relativistic jets have not been\nobserved from the region near Sgr A\u2217 , it is possible to neglect the effects of the motion of\nthe blob as a first step of investigation.\nIn our simulations the injection of nonthermal electrons in the blob triggers flares. Shock\nacceleration in the blob or magnetic reconnection can supply such nonthermal electrons.\nWe solve the kinetic equations of electrons and photons as in Kusunose et al. (2000) and\nLi & Kusunose (2000). We include the injection of nonthermal electrons, radiative cooling\n(synchrotron and inverse Compton scattering), and escape from the blob. The injection rate\nper unit volume and unit interval of \u03b3, where \u03b3 is the electron Lorentz factor, is given by\n\u001a\n0,\nif \u03b3 < \u03b3min ,\nq(\u03b3) =\n(1)\n\u2212p\nK\u03b3 exp(\u2212\u03b3/\u03b3max ), if \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b3min ,\nwhere K, p, \u03b3min, and \u03b3max are parameters. The value of \u03b3max can be a function of time, which\nallows different shapes of light curves. In our model described below, we assume that \u03b3max\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nincreases linearly with time to fit the flare light curves of 2007 April 4. The normalization\nfactor, K, is determined by assigning the value of the injection rate per unit volume, i.e.,\nZ \u221e\nqinj =\nq(\u03b3)d\u03b3.\n(2)\n\u03b3min\n\nA time-dependent qinj model is also considered (see Section 3). The injection duration of\nnonthermal electrons, tinj , and the escape timescale of electrons from the blob, tesc , are also\nparameters. The emission mechanisms are synchrotron radiation by the nonthermal electrons\nand inverse Compton scattering of the synchrotron photons by the same electrons (SSC).\nIn this paper we do not consider Comptonization of external soft photons such as radiation from accretion flow. We discuss the validity of this assumption in Section 4. Furthermore, the adiabatic expansion of an initially optically thick blob is excluded, because there\nis no significant delay or asymmetry in the longer wavelength emission relative to the peak\nof the X-ray flare (Dodds-Eden et al. 2009).\n\n3.\n\nNumerical Results\n\nNumerical models are obtained for the parameters such as R, B, qinj , p, \u03b3min, \u03b3max ,\ntinj , and tesc . For a black hole mass MBH = 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 , the Schwarzschild radius is RS =\n2GMBH /c2 = 1.2 \u00d7 1012 cm. The light crossing time of this size is RS /c \u223c 40 s. The particle\nescape occurs by advection, so that we set tesc \u223c several R/c. In our model the injection\nduration is strongly related to the flare timescale. The values of parameters are determined\nby the SED of IR and X-ray flares and light curves. For this purpose, we use the data of the\n2007 IR/X-ray flare given in Porquet et al. (2008) and Dodds-Eden et al. (2009).\n\n3.1.\n\nLight Curves\n\nIn our model, the emission in both IR and X-ray bands is produced by synchrotron\nradiation. The maximum value of \u03bdF\u03bd of synchrotron emission appears at \u223c 1016 Hz, which\nis in between the IR and X-rays bands, where F\u03bd is the energy flux per unit frequency.\nThe luminosity of X-rays is sensitive to the values of \u03b3max and tinj . This is because Xrays are emitted by the electrons in the high energy end of the electron spectrum and the\ncooling time of those electrons is short. As soon as the injection rate of nonthermal electrons\ndecreases, the X-ray luminosity declines. Because IR emitting electrons have longer cooling\ntime than X-ray emitting electrons, the IR luminosity is more dependent on tesc than the\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nX-ray luminosity. If tesc is long enough, the X-ray emitting electrons begin to pile up as\nlower energy electrons that emit IR.\nWe first examine light curves of the IR and X-ray bands for various models. For models\nin this subsection, we assume that R = 1013 cm, B = 20 G, \u03b3min = 2, p = 1.3, tinj = 8R/c,\nand tesc = 5R/c. The blob is initially empty at t = 0 and nonthermal electrons are injected\nfor t > 0. In Figure 1, we present light curves in the L\u2032 (3.8 \u03bcm) and 2 \u2013 10 keV bands\nfor different models of \u03b3max and qinj . When \u03b3max is fixed, high-energy electrons are injected\ninstantly at t = 0. Then the light curves rise steeply (dotted lines). It is found for this model\nthat the light curve of X-rays increases faster than that of IR, which is not in agreement\nwith the flare of 2007 April 4. To obtain slower rise of the light curves, the time dependent\n\u03b3max is assumed as shown by the dashed lines. Here we assumed that \u03b3max increases linearly\nwith time from 500 to 5 \u00d7 104 during t = 0 and tinj . For t > tinj both models (the dotted\nand dashed lines) assume qinj = 0. By fitting model light curves with the data of the flares,\nwe found that the above models have shorter decline timescales than the observed one. We\nthen assume that the injection rate decreases gradually after t = tinj . As an example, we use\na model with q(\u03b3) \u221d exp[\u2212(t \u2212 tinj )/(\u03betinj )] for t > tinj . In Figure 1, a model with \u03be = 0.25\nis shown by the solid lines (model A). In this model \u03b3max is constant for t > tinj .\nIn Figures 2 and 3, we compare model light curves to the observed data for 2007 April\n4. Here the model light curves are the same as shown by the solid lines in Figure 1, i.e.,\nmodel A. The details of the model parameters are given in Table 1. The size of the blob R\nis 1013 cm and this corresponds to the light crossing time of 334 s. In this figure, the peak\ntime of the luminosity of the model is shifted so that the model curves coincide with the\nobserved light curves. We assumed the linear dependence of \u03b3max on time for t < tinj and\nthe gradual decline of the injection rate for t > tinj . The fact that IR and X-rays attain the\npeak flux almost simultaneously (Dodds-Eden et al. 2009) implies that the value of \u03b3max\nincreases during the rising phase of the light curves, i.e., the acceleration of higher energy\nelectrons is still underway in the early phase of the flare.\nThe cooling time of X-ray emitting electrons is \u223c 11 s and much shorter than the escape\ntime tesc \u223c 1.7 \u00d7 103 s, if 10 keV of X-rays are assumed. On the other hand, NIR is emitted\nby electrons with \u03b3 \u223c 103 . The synchrotron cooling time of those NIR emitting electrons is\ncomparable with tesc , i.e., tcool \u223c 2 \u00d7 103 s. Thus the cooling is effective in X-rays during the\ndecay of the flare and the decline time of the X-ray light curve is shorter than that of NIR.\nThe decline of the NIR light curve is regulated by both tcool and tesc . As shown in Figure 7,\na bump appears at \u03b3 \u223c 103 in the electron spectrum. This is because of balance between\nradiative cooling and escape.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.2.\n\nSpectral Energy Distribution\n\nWe next show the evolution of the flare SED of model A and compare the model to\nthe observations in Figure 4. The quiescent model by Yuan et al. (2003) is also shown\nfor comparison. The maximum flare luminosity is 5.0 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 at t = 9R/c. This\nluminosity is much higher than the submillimeter luminosity in the quiescent state, but this\nflare does not strongly affect the spectrum in the submillimeter wavelength. During the\nrising phase, synchrotron emission becomes luminous and attains the peak at t \u223c 8R/c. The\npeak frequency increases because \u03b3max increases for t < tinj . While the emission decays, the\nspectrum in the IR and X-ray bands become flatter and a dip appears at \u223c 1015 Hz.\nIt is noted that the SSC component appears in the GeV region, whose intensity might\nbe too small to be observed. However, other sets of parameter values allow a stronger GeV\nflux as shown below.\nSince the number of parameters is large and observed data are few, there is uncertainty\nin determining the parameter values to fit the data. We show another model (model B) with\np = 1.8 in Figure 5. When p has a larger value, the value of \u03b3min should be larger for the\nradio flare not to exceed the quiescent radio emission. When the value of p is larger and the\nvalue of \u03b3min is fixed, there are more electrons with lower energy for the same IR and X-ray\nluminosities as the observed data. This constraint on \u03b3min may be not strong, if flares in\nradio occur simultaneously.\nAs shown in Figure 4, our model predicts the emission in the GeV band, which is\nproduced by inverse Compton scattering of IR-optical photons, i.e., SSC process. The luminosity in the GeV band is not strongly constrained in our model. In Figure 6, we show a\nmodel with a larger luminosity in the GeV band (model C). A smaller value of the magnetic\nfield and a higher injection rate produce a luminous SSC component. The difference of SEDs\nin Figures 4 and 6 also appears in the IR band of the decaying phase. In Figure 4 the IR\nspectrum becomes flat after t \u223c 12R/c, while that in Figure 6 keeps hard spectral shape.\n\n3.3.\n\nElectron Spectrum and Energetics\n\nThe time evolution of the electron spectrum of model A is shown in Figure 7. The\nnumber density of electrons increases for t < tinj because of injection. For t > tinj , the injection rate decreases exponentially with time. The higher energy electrons decrease because\nof radiative cooling. Also on timescale tesc , electrons escape from the blob.\nThe time evolution of the energy densities of the radiation urad and the kinetic energy\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nof electrons ue is shown in Figure 8 for model A. In our model the magnetic field is assumed\nto be constant. The energy content is dominated by the magnetic energy density uB , i.e.,\nuB /ue \u223c 16 at t \u223c 8R/c. This is in contrast with blazar models, where the kinetic energy\nof nonthermal electrons/positrons dominates over the magnetic energy (Kino et al. 2002).\nBlazars are relativistic jets aligned with the line of sight and the relativistic beaming effect\nenhances the luminosity, while our model of Sgr A\u2217 does not have relativistic motion. It\nshould be also noted that blazars have a luminous SSC or external Compton component in\nthe \u03b3-ray band, while model A has only a weak SSC component. When the SSC component\nis more luminous as in model C, the electron energy dominates over the magnetic energy,\ni.e., uB /ue \u223c 0.1 at t \u223c 8R/c.\n\n4.\n\nSummary and Discussion\n\nWe calculated the SEDs and light curves from a blob as a model of the IR and Xray flares observed from Sgr A\u2217 . Because we performed time-dependent calculations, it\nwas possible to study the evolution of radiation and electron spectra in detail, which is\ndifferent from most of previous work. Our model assumes that IR and X-rays are emitted\nby synchrotron radiation of nonthermal electrons injected in the blob. This model explains\nthe characteristics of 2007 April 4 flare in IR/X-rays such as (1) the simultaneity of the\nX-ray and IR flares, (2) the steeper decline of the X-ray flare than the IR flare, (3) the flare\ntimescale of 100 minutes. The flare timescale in our model is mainly determined by the\ninjection time of nonthermal electrons, which is related to particle acceleration mechanisms\nand to be studied in future work. To compare the light curves we assumed that the value\nof \u03b3max increases linearly with time. If the value of \u03b3max is fixed during injection, our model\ndoes not explain the simultaneity of the X-ray and IR flares. The higher energy electrons\nresponsible for X-ray emission are thus being accelerated in the rising phase of the flare.\nWe compared the SEDs of different models. While model A has a faint SSC component\nin \u03b3-rays and a larger value of uB /ue , model C has a bright SSC one and a smaller value of\nuB /ue . If model C is applicable, we will observe \u03b3-rays in the GeV band. Future observations\nin the GeV band will constrain the model parameters as well as the energetics in the flare\nregions. Because the blob might be ejected from RIAF by magnetohydrodynamic processes\nand nonthermal electrons are accelerated in the collisonless shock, the observations of GeV\n\u03b3-rays will clarify the origin of the blobs and the particle acceleration mechanisms.\nThe spectral index of NIR is almost constant during a flare in model C, while the\nspectrum becomes flatter during the decay in models A and B. In model C, the cooling time\nis longer than that of models A and B, because the magnetic field is weaker. Then only\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nescape time, which is independent of electron energy, regulates the decay of the NIR flare.\nPrevious work mainly modeled the SED of flares by steady state models and did not utilize the data of light curves. Time-dependent models were recently published by Sabha et al.\n(2010). They assumed SSC for X-ray flares and combined adiabatic expansion to account\nfor light curves of 2007 April 4. To fit the data six source components are needed. While it\nis possible to attribute the IR substructure to those multi-components of sources, it seems\ndifficult to produce many emission regions coherently to cause flares.\nIt is known that IR flares sometimes occur without X-ray flares. This might be owing\nto a small value of \u03b3max because of inefficient acceleration, rapid radiative cooling, or adiabatic cooling. If, for example, a blob is close to RIAF and external Compton scattering is\nimportant, synchrotron X-ray flares are suppressed. If this is the case, the effect of external\nCompton scattering appears as weak X-ray flares or hard spectral X-ray emission. This\nis because when synchrotron X-ray flares are absent, the kinetic energy of electrons with\n\u03b3 & 103 are given to the RIAF photons with \u03bd \u223c 1012 Hz, yielding X-rays with \u03bd & 1018 Hz.\nThe intensity of these X-rays depends on the distance of the blob from RIAF.\nWe neglected the effect of the radiation from the RIAF in the flare emission spectra. By\ninverse Compton scattering of submillimeter photons with 1012 Hz, electrons with \u03b3max \u223c 104\nproduces gamma-rays with \u223c 1 MeV. If the submillimeter emission (L \u223c 3.85 \u00d7 1035 erg\ns\u22121 ) is received by the blob, the energy density of the submillimeter photons in the blob is\n\u223c 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22122 erg cm\u22123 . Here we assumed that the photon density decreases as the square of\nthe distance, that the distance of the blob from the submillimeter emission region is 1 AU,\nand that the submillimeter emission is isotropic. This energy density should be compared\nwith that of synchrotron photons in the blob, \u223c 0.3 erg cm\u22123 at t \u223c 8R/c (model A). Thus\nexternal Compton scattering of submillimeter photons is negligible, if the distance is greater\nthan about 1 AU.\nAfter completion of this work, we noticed a paper by Dodds-Eden et al. (2010). They\nsolved a kinetic equation of electrons and obtained time-dependent flare spectra of synchrotron radiation: Note that they did not calculate SSC spectra. In their work flares are\ncaused by the change in the injection rate and magnetic fields, while we assumed the change\nin the injection rate and \u03b3max .\n\nREFERENCES\nAharonian, F. et al. 2004, A&A, 425, L13\nAlbert, J. et al. 2006, ApJ, 638, L101\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nBaganoff, F.
