Several approximation to take overlapping\ninto account are suggested. The small parameter responsible for convergence is extracted. The multi particle effects of overlapping are\ndescribed.\n\nIntroduction\nKinetics of the first order phase transitions includes many aspects of evolution. One of such aspects is the exhaustion of the volume where the embryos\ncan appear. Since A.N.Kolmogorov [1] has solved a problem of exhaustion\nfor the case of crystallization this problem is considered to be analyzed completely.\nNevertheless in the case of nucleation of a supersaturated vapor into a\nliquid state of droplets kinetics of nucleation is governed by another mechanisms which depends on the Knudsen number characterizing the nucleating\nsystem. Under the small Knudsen numbers the kinetics of nucleation was\ndescribed in [2]. Under the big Knudsen numbers kinetics resembles kinetics of crystallization but with some modifications. These modifications were\ndescribed in [3]. Here the precise solution of this problem is absent. The\nsource of difficulties lies in a very specific behavior of exhausted regions. In\nthis paper the further investigation of this problem is presented.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nDirect regions\n\nThe rate of nucleation J as it is shown in [3] is proportional to the volume\nVf ree of the non-exhausted region\nJ \u223c Vf ree\nThe total volume of the system Vtot is supposed to be the unit one. Our task\nis to determine Vf ree as accurate as possible.\nCertainly,\nVf ree = 1 \u2212 Vexh\nwhere Vexh is the volume of the region exhausted by already existed droplets.\nAround the formed droplet there will be an exhausted region formed by\nthe vapor consumption by this very droplet. This region will be called as a\n\"direct region\".\nFor Vexh one can write the following representation:\nVexh =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n0\n\nJ(t\u2032 )Vcl (t, t\u2032 )dt\u2032\n\nHere t = 0 is the initial moment of time, t is the current moment of time.\nThe value Vcl (t, t\u2032 ) is the (mean) volume which is exhausted at the moment\nt from Vf ree by the embryos formed at t\u2032 . For the last value one can suggest\nseveral approximations.\n\n1.1\n\nKolmogorov's result\n\nIn crystallization Kolmogorov justified the following result\nVcl (t, t\u2032 ) = V0 (t, t\u2032 )\nHere V0 (t, t\u2032 ) is the volume of the region which is exhausted at t elsewhere\nby embryos formed at t\u2032 .\nIn crystallization\nV0 \u223c (t \u2212 t\u2032 )d\nwhere d is the dimensionality of space. The linear size R \u223c Vo1/d of the direct\nregion grows linearly in time. This is the crucial point in justification of the\nKolmogorov's result.\n2\n\n\fIn general situation of nucleation asymptotically at t \u2212 t\u2032 \u2192 \u221e one can\nsee that\nO(t \u2212 t\u2032 )d/2 \u2264 V0 \u2264 O(t \u2212 t\u2032 )d\nIt means that the linear size grows as\nO(t \u2212 t\u2032 )1/2 \u2264 R \u2264 O(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\nSo, the non-linearity is not too strong and this will be the source of several\napproximations considered below.\nIn any situation the dependence R(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) is known. Ordinary R \u223c (t \u2212\nt\u2032 )1/2 .\n\n1.2\n\nStochastic approximations\n\nIn stochastic approximation the following approximation\nVcl (t, t\u2032 ) = Vf ree (t)V0 (t, t\u2032 )\nis taken.\nThis approximation implies stochastic overlapping of volumes V0 coming\nfrom different droplets. Why for the volume V depending oh t and t\u2032 the\noverlapping is taken at t? More reasonable is to take the half-sum\nVcl (t, t\u2032 ) =\n\n(Vf ree (t) + Vf ree (t\u2032 ))\nV0 (t, t\u2032 )\n2\n\nor\nVcl (t, t\u2032 ) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt\u2032\n\nVf ree (t\u2032\u2032 )dt\u2032\u2032 V0 (t, t\u2032 )\n\nThe approximate linearity of R(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) leads to the approximate similarity\nof all approaches.\n\n2\n\nApproximation of pair interaction\n\nConsider the auxiliary problem which is formulated as following:\nConsider the droplet born at t\u2032\u2032 . The question is what will be the part of\nV0 occupied by direct regions from other droplets.\nOne can approximately suppose that outside direct region of this droplet\nthe rate of nucleation is not perturbed and inside the direct region the rate\nof nucleation is zero.\n3\n\n\fThen the problem is purely geometrical one. One has simply to calculate\nthe overlapping of spheres. The value Vover (r \u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 , r \u2032, t\u2032 ) is the volume of\noverlapping for the droplet born at t\u2032\u2032 in the point r~\u2032\u2032 and the droplet born\nat t\u2032 in the point r~\u2032 . It is calculated purely geometrically.\nAlso purely geometrically one can calculate the boundary rb\u2032 of the direct\nregion and the time tb when the given r \u2032\u2032 is attained by the boundary of this\ndirect region.\nAs the result one can easily calculate the total volume of overlapping by\nintegration\nVol =\n\nZ\n\ntb\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n2R(t\u22120)\n\n0\n\ndrSd Vover (0, t\u2032\u2032 , r.t\u2032 )\n\nHere tb is a minimum of t and tb , Sd is the surface square of a sphere of radius\nr in a space with dimension d.\nThe problem is that the supposition that outside direct region of the\ndroplet the rate of nucleation is not perturbed and inside the direct region\nthe rate of nucleation is zero is no more than an approximation.\nAnother approximation is that the rate of nucleation outside is J(t\u2032 ) taken\nfrom another approximation, for example, from the previous one. Then\nVol =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ntb\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2R(t\u22120)\n\ndrSd J(t\u2032 )Vover (0, t\u2032\u2032 , r.t\u2032 )\n\nUnfortunately, the rate of nucleation J(t\u2032 ) strongly depends here on r.\nTo see this we can analyze the region (it will be called \"an inverse region\")\nwhere the region is forbidden to have the free point r, t\u2032 . This region can\ncross the direct region for the droplet born at 0, t\u2032\u2032 .\nIt means that in the outside region near rb\u2032 the rate of nucleation is higher\nthan far from rb\u2032\nThis correlation is missed here.\n\n3\n\nApproximations for estimates\n\nThe effective approach is to note that d \u226b 1 and use this fact. For example\nfor d = 3 the droplets appeared until the first quarter of the nucleation period\nin decay conditions occupy the small part of the whole volume and later all\nevolution is governed namely by these droplets. This fact allows to construct\napproximations as it is shown in [4].\n\n4\n\n\f4\n\nInverse region\n\nInverse region for the droplet born at r \u2032 , t\u2032 is the geometrical place of points\nwhere the formation is forbidden to have the possibility to form droplet at\nr \u2032 , t\u2032 . Certainly, this region is situated symmetrically to the direct region of\nthe same droplet.\nIn the case of the Kolmogorov's solution R = A(t\u2212t\u2032 ) with some constant\nA. Then any inverse region can not cross any direct region.\nHaving required that at the bottom of inverse region there is no formation\nof droplets one can see that there is no traces of direct regions in the whole\ninverse region. Then the Kolmogorov's approximation really takes place.\nConsider now the general situation. Let P\u2212 (t) be a probability that in\nthe point r = 0 at t there is a free point. For P\u2212 (t) one can write\nP\u2212 (t) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032\n\nZ\n\nrb\n\n0\n\ndr \u2032 Sd P\u2212 (t\u2032 , r \u2032)\n\nwhere P\u2212 (t\u2032 , r \u2032 ) is the probability that the point r \u2032 , t\u2032 is free.\nLet r \u2032 , t\u2032 be inside th inverse region formed at r = 0, t. For P\u2212 (t\u2032 , r \u2032 ) one\nhas to construct the inverse region. This region can go outside the inverse\nregion of r = 0, t. This is the difficulty. For P\u2212 (t\u2032 , r \u2032) one can then write\nP\u2212 (t\u2032 , r \u2032) =\n\nZ\n\nt\u2032\n\n0\n\nZ\n\ndt\u2032\u2032 [\n\nVexhausted\n\ndr~\u2032\u2032P\u2212 (t\u2032\u2032 , r \u2032\u2032 ) +\n\nZ\n\nVnon\u2212exhausted\n\ndr~\u2032\u2032 P\u2212 (t\u2032\u2032 , r \u2032\u2032 )]\n\nHere Vexhausted is the inverse region based on r \u2032 , t\u2032 which lies inside the inverse\nregion based on 0, t and Vnon\u2212exhausted is the inverse region based on r \u2032 , t\u2032 which\nlies outside the inverse region based on 0, t.\nThe last separation is artificial but it will be essential in further approximations.\nThe integral equation is the linear one. Moreover, in dimension d = 3\nthere exists a cylinder symmetry.\nThe suitable way is an iteration solution based on the smallness of overlapping\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nP\u2212(i) (t , r ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nZ\n\ndt [\n\nVexhausted\n\ndr~\u2032\u2032 P\u2212(i\u22121) (t\u2032\u2032 , r \u2032\u2032 )+\n\nZ\n\nVnon\u2212exhausted\n\ndr~\u2032\u2032 P\u2212(i\u22121) (t\u2032\u2032 , r \u2032\u2032 )]\n\nThe initial approximation is evident: P = 1 in Vexhausted , P = Pmean in\nVnon\u2212exhausted. Here Pmean is some mean rate of nucleation calculated by\n5\n\n\fother approximations. The smallness of overlapping ensures the convergence\nof iterations.\nThis consideration is also some approximation. Here we do not take into\naccount the possibility to born the third droplet with its own inverse region\nwhich causes the change of P\u2212 .\n\n5\n\nApproximate simplification\n\nIf one approximates J by initial intensity J0 in Vexhausted and by the mean\nintensity J \u0304 in Vnon\u2212exhausted then one can see a very simple expression\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nJ(t , r ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\u2032\n\n \u0304 non\u2212exhausted]\ndt\u2032\u2032 [J0 Vexhausted + JV\n\nThe last approximation is both simple and accurate one.\nEarlier the effects of interaction (overlapping) of three and more regions\nwere not taken into account. Since the effects of overlapping are small, the\ninfluence of effective interaction of several particles are small.\n\n6\n\nOne limit case\n\nIn order to construct the procedure taking into account effects of overlapping\n(interference) of exhausted regions initiated by different droplets one has to\noutline the parameter responsible for the relative smallness of the manydroplets effects. Only then the effects under consideration will have the\norder of corrections and can be considered as some perturbations.\nThe small parameter \u01eb of the theory will be, thus, a ratio of the square\nof exhausted region with overlapping to the the square of exhausted region\nwithout overlapping. We expect that \u01eb is seriously less than 1.\nOrdinary the growth of the linear size of the exhausted region can be well\napproximated by a power-like dependence\nR(t, t\u2032 ) = A(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03b1\nwith parameters A and \u03b1. The case \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e corresponds to the maximum of\n\u01eb.\nFortunately, this case allows analytical solution.\n\n6\n\n\fThe case \u03b1 = \u221e corresponds to instantaneous creation of the exhausted\nregion of some radius R0 . Then the probability P\u2212 (r, t) to be the point r free\nat the moment t equals to\nP\u2212 (r, t) =\n\nZ\n\nS R0\n\ndr\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032 P\u2212 (r \u2032 , t\u2032 )I0\n\nwhere the space integral is taken over the sphere of the radius R0 with the\ncenter r and I0 is the kinetic factor, i.e. the free intensity of the droplets\nformation.\nThe crucial point of consideration is that here P\u2212 can not depend on r \u2032 .\nThen\nZ t\n3\nP\u2212 (r, t) = 4\u03c0R0\ndt\u2032 P\u2212 (r, t\u2032 )I0 /3\n0\n\nThe differentiation gives\n\u2202P\u2212 (r, t)\n= 4\u03c0R03 P\u2212 (r, t)I0 /3\n\u2202t\nThe last differential equation has an evident solution\nP\u2212 (r, t) = exp(\u22124\u03c0R03 t/3)\nwhere initial moment of time is taken as t = 0.\nThen it is easy to calculate the total number of exhausted regions\nMtot =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndtP\u2212 (r, t) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndtexp(\u22124\u03c0R03 t/3) = 3/(4\u03c0R03)\n\nThe absence of overlapping corresponds to the linearized version, i.e.\nMlin ==\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n3/(4\u03c0R30 )\n\ndt(1 \u2212 4\u03c0R03 t/3) = 3/(8\u03c0R03 )\n\nSo, Mtot = 2Mlin . Since the squares of all exhausted regions are 4\u03c0R03 /3, the\nlast ratio will be the power of overlapping, i.e.\n\u01eb = (Mtot \u2212 Mlin )/Mlin\nSo, in any situation \u01eb and can be considered as a small parameter.\n\n7\n\n\f7\n\nThe scheme of calculation\n\nNow it is worth to present a concrete effective scheme of construction of the\nmulti-particle effects of overlapping.\nThe first step is the formal one - to form the first droplet at r \u2032 , t\u2032 .\nThe rate of nucleation inside the exhausted region of the first droplet\n(ER1 ) is zero. The question is to find the rate of nucleation outside ER1 .\nThen it is possible to choose two alternative possibilities to go forward.\nThe first one is to choose the rate of nucleation outside ER1 to be the ideal\nvalue I0 . This approach is very close to the direct simulation of the process.\nUnfortunately, in this approach to get a suitable effect it is necessary to take\ninto account many neighbor droplets. For example, in the plane case the\nnumber of neighbors has to be greater than six. In the free-dimensional case\nthis number is greater than twelve.\nThe second possibility is more effective. Instead of I0 outside the ER1\n \u0304 One can define the average rate\none can use the average rate of nucleation I.\nof nucleation IV over the volume V as\n1\nIV =\nV\n\nZ\n\nV\n\ndrI(r, t)\n\nThe value I \u0304 is the limit value\nI \u0304 = IV\nNamely this value is chosen as the rate of nucleation outside ER1 .\nCorrections to the last value appear because near the boundary of ER1\nsome droplets which might affect on a point outside ER1 had been born in\nER1 where formation is forbidden.\nThe rate of this value has an order of relative volume of intersection of\nER1 and inverse region IR of the second droplet, i.e. IR2 .
