I NTRODUCTION\nLet X be a projective nonsingular curve of genus g \u2265 2 defined over an algebraic closed\nfield k of characteristic p > 0. Let G be a subgroup of the automorphism group Aut(X) of\nX and let G(P ) be the subgroup of automorphisms stabilizing a point P on X. Consider\nalso the Weierstrass semigroup attached at the point P . In characteristic zero there are\nresults [29] relating the structure of the Weierstrass semigroup at P to the subgroup G(P ).\nIn this paper we will try to prove analogous results in the positive characteristic case.\nIt turns out that there is a close connection of the automorphism group, the Weierstrass\nsemigroup and other invariants of the curve like the rank of the Hasse-Witt matrix. Aim\nof this article is to show how various invariants of a curve are encoded in the Weierstrass\nsemigroup.\nSection 2 is devoted to connections of the theory of decomposition groups G(P ) to the\ntheory of Weierstrass semigroups. Both the theory of the Weierstrass semigroups and the\ndecomposition groups G(P ) are more difficult when p > 0. In characteristic zero it is\nknown that G(P ) is always a cyclic group, while when p > 0 and p divides |G(P )| the\ngroup G(P ) is no more cyclic and admits the following ramification filtration:\nG(P ) = G0 (P ) \u2283 G1 (P ) \u2283 G2 (P ) \u2283 . . . ,\nRecall that the groups Gi (P ) are defined as Gi (P ) = {\u03c3 \u2208 G(P ) : vP (\u03c3(t) \u2212 t) \u2265 i + 1},\nfor a local uniformizer t at P and vP is the corresponding valuation. Notice that G1 (P ) is\nthe p-part of G(P ). For every point P of the curve X we consider the sequence of k-vector\nspaces\nk = L(0) = L(P ) = * * * = L((i \u2212 1)P ) < L(iP ) \u2264 * * * \u2264 L((2g \u2212 1)P ),\nwhere\nL(iP ) := {f \u2208 k(X)\u2217 : div(f ) + iP \u2265 0} \u222a {0}.\nWe will write l(D) = dimk L(D). An integer i will be called a pole number\nif there \u0001is\n\u0001\na function f \u2208 k(X)\u2217 so that div\u221e (f ) = iP or equivalently l (i \u2212 1)P + 1 = l iP .\nThe set of pole numbers at P form a semigroup H(P ) which is called the Weierstrass\nsemigroup at P . It is known that there are exactly g pole numbers that are smaller or equal\nto 2g \u2212 1 and that every integer i \u2265 2g \u2212 1 is in the Weierstrass semigroup, see [40, I.6.7].\nDate: November 13, 2018.\nkeywords: Automorphisms, Curves, Differentials, Numerical Semigroups, Hasse-Witt invariant, maximal\ncurves.

In characteristic zero for all but finite points (the so called Weierstass points),\nthe generic situation for the gaps at P is the set {1, . . . , g}. This is not correct in positive\ncharacteristic, where the generic set of gaps might be different than the set {1, . . . , g}.\nRemark 2. The Weierstrass semigroup seems to be defined locally at a given point P . But\nthe condition on the existence of function with only pole at P is a global condition and lot\nof global invariants like the genus or the Hasse-Witt matrix [41] are encoded in it.\nIn section 2.1 we recall the relation of the representation of the p-part of the decomposition group into the Riemann-Roch spaces introduced in [20]. In section 2.2 we introduce\nthe representation filtration that shares many properties with the ramification filtration and\naffects the structure of the Weierstrass semigroup. In propositions 21 and 22 we characterize the jumps of the representation filtration in terms of the Weierstrass semigroup and\nin terms of the intermediate field extensions. Valentini and Madan [46, lemma 2] did a\nsimilar computation for the gaps of the ramification filtration for cyclic groups using the\ntheory of Witt vectors, see [45],[35].\nSection 2.3 is devoted to the description of the Weierstrass semigroup when G1 (P )\nis a cyclic group. This is an important case to understand, because of its simplicity and\nbecause of Oort conjecture regarding the deformation of a curve with automorphisms from\ncharacteristic p to characteristic 0. These results should be seen as the characteristic p\nanalogon of the work of Morrison-Pinkham [29] on Weierstrass semigroups for Galois\nWeierstrass points.\nIn section 2.4 we still study the semigroups that can appear in the cyclic group case but\nusing the Boseck invariants. These are invariants that were first introduced by Boseck in\n[4] in the study of basis of holomorphic differentials of curves that are cyclic extensions\nof the rational function fields. Boseck in his very important and interesting article studied\nthe Weierstrass semigroups in this case. Unfortunately, he didn't notice that there is one\ncase that needs more attention, namely the case of a cover where only one point is ramified\nand the prime number is \"small\". What we mean by small will be clear in the sequel. For\nexample for the case of Artin-Schreier curves small means that the characteristic is smaller\nthan the conductor. The same problem is now in several places in the literature like [6,\np.235 remark (i)], [44, p. 170 in first 3 lines], [7, p. 3028, remark (i)]. For the special case\nof Artin-Schreier extension the correct treatment is the one in lemma 40.\nThe curves that appear as covers of the projective line with only one ramified point are\nvery interesting. This is because curves with large automorphisms groups appear this way\n[38] and because of the Katz-Gabber compactification of local actions [18, Thm 1.4.1],[12,\nCor. 1.9].\nIn section 3 we study the maximal gap in the semigroup and we give bounds for it,\nin terms of several invariants of the curve. When this maximal gap equals to 2g \u2212 1\nat some point P , then the Weierstrass semigroup is called symmetric and that point is a\nWeierstrass point, proposition 50. The existence of a single point in the curve that has a\nsymmetric Weierstrass semigroup determines the genus of the curve, proposition 50. Many\nwell known examples of curves enjoy that property. In particular, we determine the cyclic\ntotally ramified coverings of the rational function field with this symmetric Weierstrass\nsemigroups in lemmata 44 and 45\nSection 4 is devoted to the dependence of the Cartier operator and the Hasse-Witt invariant to the theory of Weierstrass semigroups. We give some results about big actions,\nlemma 18, corollary 56 and characterize some non classical curves with respect to the\ncanonical linear series and nilpotent Cartier operator, corollary 57. We also characterize\nall the maximal curves over Fq2 with two generators for the Weierstrass semigroup at a\nFq2 \u2013rational point, as curves with symmetric Weierstrass semigroups at this point, remark\n59. Finally we study further the connection between symmetric Weierstrass semigroups\nand maximal curves.\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF CURVES AND WEIERSTRASS SEMIGROUPS\n\n3\n\n2.

Let m = mr >\nmr\u22121 > * * * > m0 = 0 be the pole numbers at P that are \u2264 m. If Gi (P ) > Gi+1 (P )\nthen i = m \u2212 mk , for some pole number mk .\nRemark 6. Notice that in this article we enumerate the pole numbers in terms of an increasing function i 7\u2192 mi . In [20] the enumeration is in terms of a decreasing function.\n2.2. Jumps in the ramification filtration and divisibility of the Weierstrass semigroup.\nConsider a Galois cover \u03c0 : X \u2192 Y = X/G of algebraic curves, and let P be a fully ramified point of X. How are the Weierstrass semigroup sequences of P , and \u03c0(P ) related?\nLemma 7. Let k(X), k(Y ) = k(X)G denote the function fields of the curves X and Y\nrespectively. The morphisms\nNG : k(X) \u2192 k(Y ) and \u03c0 \u2217 : k(Y ) \u2192 k(X),\nQ\nsending f \u2208 k(X) to NG (f ) = \u03c3\u2208 G f and g \u2208 k(Y ) to \u03c0 \u2217 g \u2208 k(X) respectively,\ninduce injections\n\u00d7|G|\n\nNG : H(P ) \u2192 H(Q) and \u03c0 \u2217 : H(Q) \u2212\u2192 H(P ),\nwhere Q := \u03c0(P ).\nProof. For every element f \u2208 k(X) such that (f )\u221e = mP , the element NG (f ) is a Ginvariant element, so it is in k(Y ). Moreover, the pole order of NG (f ) seen as a function\non k(X) is |G| * m. But since P is fully ramified the valuation of NG (f ) expressed in\nterms of the local uniformizer at \u03c0(P ) is just \u2212m.\nOn the other hand side an element g \u2208 k(Y ) seen as an element of k(X) by considering\nthe pullback \u03c0 \u2217 (g) has for the same reason valuation at P multiplied by the order of G. \u0003\n\n\f4\n\nSOTIRIS KARANIKOLOPOULOS AND ARISTIDES KONTOGEORGIS\n\nRemark 8. The condition of fully ramification is necessary in the above lemma. Indeed,\nif a point Q \u2208 Y has more than one elements in \u03c0 \u22121 (Q) then the pullback of g, such\nthat (g)\u221e = mQ, is supported on \u03c0 \u22121 (Q) and gives no information for the Weierstrass\nsemigroup of any of the points P \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (Q).\nWe will prove the following:\nLemma 9. If an element f such that (f )\u221e = aP is invariant under the action of a subgroup H < G1 (P ), then |H| divides a.\nProof. Write f = u/ta in terms of a local uniformizer t at P and a unit u. Since f\nis invariant it is the pullback of a function g \u2208 k(X/H). If t\u2032 is a local uniformizer at\nQ = \u03c0(P ) then g is expressed as g = u\u2032 /t\u2032b . Since t\u2032 = t|H| v for some unit v, [14, IV\n2.2c] the desired result follows.\n\u0003\nDefinition 10. Let 0 = m0 < m1 < m2 < . . . < mr be the sequence of pole numbers up\nto mr . For each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r we consider the representations\n\u03c1i : G1 (P ) \u2192 GL(L(mi P )).\nWe form the decreasing sequence of groups:\n(3)\n\nG1 (P ) = ker\u03c10 \u2287 ker\u03c11 \u2287 ker\u03c12 \u2287 * * * \u2287 ker\u03c1r = {1}.\n\nWe will cal this sequence of groups \"the representation\" filtration.\nLet \u03c3 \u2208 ker\u03c1i .

The linear series |m1 P | = P(L(m1 P )) defines a map X \u2192 P1 of degree m1 .\nThis gives rise to an algebraic extension F/k(f1 ) of degree m1 , where (f1 )\u221e = m1 P . Let\nF denote the function field of the curve X. The extension F/k(f1 ) is Galois if and only if\nm1 = | ker \u03c11 |, and in this case the Galois group is ker \u03c11 .\nProof. Observe that F \u2287 F ker \u03c11 \u2287 k(f1 ). Notice that the degree of the extension F/k(f1 )\nis m1 therefore if | ker \u03c11 | = m1 then k(f1 ) = F ker \u03c11 .\nAssume now that the extension F/k(f1 ) is Galois with Galois group A. Since F ker \u03c11 \u2287\nk(f1 ) = F A we have that A \u2287 ker \u03c11 . By definition A = {\u03c3 \u2208 G1 (P ) : \u03c3(f1 ) = f1 } \u2286\nker \u03c11 .\n\u0003\nRemark 12. In characteristic zero a point P such that the covering map X \u2192 P1 introduced by the linear system |m1 P | is Galois, is called Galois Weierstrass point. The\nWeierstrass semigroup at a Galois Weierstrass point in characteristic zero is now well understood, [29]. Notice that in positive characteristic the condition m1 \u2264 g does not imply\nthat P is a Weierstrass point, since the canonical linear system might be non classical.\nIn section 2.3 we will restrict ourselves to cyclic totally ramified extensions of order pn ,\nn \u2265 2 and then P is a Weierstrass point according to theorem 2 in [45].\nLemma 9 can be generalized as follows:\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF CURVES AND WEIERSTRASS SEMIGROUPS\n\n5\n\nProposition 13. The order |ker\u03c1i | of the group ker\u03c1i divides m\u03bd , for all \u03bd \u2264 i.\nProof. This comes out from lemma 9 since the elements fi such that (fi )\u221e = mi P are by\ndefinition ker \u03c1i -invariant.\n\u0003\nWe recall the following definition:\nDefinition 14. Given a finite group G the Frattini subgroup \u03a6(G) is defined to be the\nintersection of all proper maximal subgroups of G. If G is a p-group then the Frattini\ngroup is \u03a6(G) = Gp [G, G], and is the minimal normal subgroup N of G such that G/N\nis elementary abelian.\nConsider the first pole number m1 in the Weierstrass semigroup and a function f1 such\nthat (f1 )\u221e = m1 P . The image of the representation\n\u03c1 : G1 (P ) \u2192 GL(L(m1 P ))\nis an elementary abelian group since the representation is 2-dimensional, therefore the\ncommutator and the Frattini subgroup of G1 (P ) are in the kernel of \u03c1. This combined with\nlemma 9 gives us the following\nLemma 15. The order |\u03a6(G)| of \u03a6(G) divides the first pole number.\nExample 16. In the work of C. Lehr, M. Matignon [23] a notion of big action is defined.\nCurves having a big action were studied further by M. Rocher and M. Matignon [28],[33].\nA curve X together with a subgroup G of the automorphism group of X is called a bigaction if G is a p-group and\n|G|\n2p\n>\n.\ng\np\u22121\nAll big actions have the following property [23]:\nProposition 17. Assume that (X, G) is a big action. There is a unique point P of X such\nthat G1 (P ) = G, the group G2 (P ) is not trivial and strictly contained in G1 and the\nquotient X/G2 (P ) \u223c\n= P1 . Moreover, the group G is an extension of groups\n\u03c0\n\n0 \u2192 G2 (P ) \u2192 G = G1 (P ) \u2212\u2192 (Z/pZ)v \u2192 0.\nSince the curve X/G2 (P ) is of genus zero, the Weierstrass semigroup equals the semigroup of natural numbers, therefore |G2 (P )| * Z+ is a subsemigroup of the Weierstrass\nsemigroup at the unique fixed point P .\nLemma 18. Let (X, G) be a big action. The smallest non trivial pole number m1 in H(P )\nis |G2 (P )|.\nProof. Let f1 be the function in the function field k(X) such that (f1 )\u221e = m1 P . By [28]\nker\u03c11 = G2 (P ) and the result follows by lemma 11.\n\u0003\nTheorem 19. Let F0 be an algebraic function field of genus g, defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0. Select a place P0 of F0 and consider\nh\nan Artin-Schreier extension F/F0 given by F = F0 (y), y p \u2212 y = G, where vP0 (G) =\n\u2212m < 0, (m, p) = 1. We also assume that G has no other poles at other places of F0 . Let\nP be the unique place of F that lies above P0 . Assume that the set of gaps of F0 at P0 are\ngiven by\n\u001a\n{1 = h1 < h2 < * * * < hgF0 \u2264 2gF0 \u2212 1}, if gF0 \u2265 1\nG (P0 ) =\n.\n\u2205,\nif gF0 = 0\nThen the gaps G (P ) at P are given by\nG (P ) =\n\nh\np[\n\u22121\n\ni=1\n\nAi ,\n\n\f6\n\nSOTIRIS KARANIKOLOPOULOS AND ARISTIDES KONTOGEORGIS\n\nwith\nAi =\n\n\u001a\n\nmi \u2212 jph : 1 \u2264 j \u2264\n\n\u0016\n\nmi\nph\n\n\u0017\u001b [\n\n\b\nmi + ph hj : j = 1, 2, . . . , gF0 .\n\nProof. This is combination of theorems 1 and 5 of Lewittes, in [25]. Keep in mind that\nwe are working over an algebraically closed field, therefore all places have degree 1. Also\nLewittes proves his theorem for the more difficult case k = Fq but the proof over an\nalgebraically closed field is the same and even simpler.\n\u0003\nRemark 20. The numbers m, ph are always pole numbers, since it is not possible to express them as a gap given by theorem 19. This means that mZ+ + ph Z+ is always included\nin H(P ). If the genus of F0 is not 0, then the inclusion mZ+ + ph Z+ \u2286 H(P ) can be a\nstrict inclusion, see remark 25.\nProposition 21. If i is a jump for the representation filtration, i.e., ker \u03c1i ! ker \u03c1i+1 , then\nmi+1 6\u2208 hm1 , . . . , mi iZ+ . Also the number of jumps in the representation filtration equals\nthe minimal number of generators of H(P ) up to mr .\nProof. Let fi be elements in the function field of the curve such that div\u221e (fi ) = mi P .\nLet f1 be the first such function with a unique pole at P of order m1 .\nSuppose first that m2 = 2m1 , m3 = 3m1 , . . . , m\u03bd = \u03bdm1 are the first \u03bd pole numbers.\nThen a basis for the space L(m\u03bd P ) consists of {f1 , f12 , . . . , f1\u03bd } and it is clear that ker \u03c11 =\nker \u03c12 = * * * = ker \u03c1\u03bd .\nNow we treat the general case.PIf mi+1 is in the semigroup hm1 , . . . , mi iZ+ generated\nby all m1 , . . . , mi then mi+1 = \u03bdi \u2208Z+ \u03bdi mi and\nY\nfi\u03bdi .\nfi+1 =\n\u03bdi \u2208Z+\n\nThis implies that ker \u03c1i+1 = ker \u03c1i .\n\n\u0003\n\nThe next proposition characterize exactly the jumps of the representation filtration:\nProposition 22. Denote by Xi the curve X/ ker \u03c1i and by Fi the corresponding function\nfield. Supose that X1 = P1 and F1 = k(f1 ). The jumps at the representation filtration\nappear exactly at i such that Fi 6= Fi+1 . Moreover if i1 , i2 , . . . , in are the jumps of the\nrepresentation filtration then for all l, with 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n we have Fil = k(f0 , fi1 , . . . , fil ),\ni.e. the jumps appear exactly at the integers i such that the function fi corresponding to the\npole number mi gives rise to an element that can not be expressed as a rational function\nof f\u03bd , \u03bd < i.\nProof. We have the following picture\nG1 (P ) = ker\u03c10 \u2287 ker\u03c11 \u2287 . . . ker\u03c1i . . . \u2287 ker\u03c1r = {1}\nfor the representation filtration and the strict inclusion holds for a subscript i only when\ni \u2208 {i1 , . . . in }. In general r + 1 \u2265 n with equality holds if all pole numbers up to mr are\ngenerators, or equivalently when all the inclusions above are strict. We also have\nX/G1 (P )\nO\n\n/ X/ker\u03c11\nO\n\n/ . . .

We will\ndenote be HFi (Qi ) the Weierstrass semigroup of the field Fi at the place Qi . We have\nassumed that F1 = k(f1 ) is a rational function field and thus the semigroup of P1 is\nHF1 (Q1 ) = Z+ . This gives us that | ker \u03c11 |Z+ \u2282 HFr (P ).\nThere are now two cases: Either the group G1 (P ) acts trivially on f1 therefore ker \u03c11 =\nG1 (P ), or the group G1 (P ) might act on f1 by translations (this is the only possible Galois\naction of a p-group on a rational function field see [44]). The function field generator\nof F0 gives rise to pole numbers that are multiplies of |G1 (P )|. Since | ker \u03c11 | divides\n|G1 (P )| all pole numbers coming from the function field generator of F0 are already in\n| ker \u03c11 |Z+ \u2282 HFr (P ). Notice that 0 is a jump in the representation filtration only if f1 is\nnot G1 (P )-invariant. In that case F0 (f1 ) = F1 .\nSuppose that 1 is the first jump of the representation filtration, i.e. take i1 = 1. We\nproceed to the first mi1 such that mi1 6\u2208 | ker \u03c11 |Z+ , i.e. we choose the minimal mi with\nthe property that | ker \u03c11 | \u2224 mi for 1 < i. This means that the element fi1 is not ker \u03c11 invariant and ker \u03c11 ) ker \u03c1i1 , i.e. the first jump in the representation filtration appears\nat the first mi1 that is not in | ker \u03c11 |Z+ . The extension Fi1 /F1 is elementary abelian with\nGalois group ker \u03c11 / ker \u03c1i1 . The element fi1 is not an element in F1 since every element\nin F1 is ker \u03c11 -invariant.\nSuppose now that i1 6= 1. Then ker \u03c10 = ker \u03c11 = * * * = ker \u03c1i1 , with m\u03bd \u2208\n| ker \u03c1i1 |Z+ for all \u03bd \u2264 i1 . We choose mi2 minimally such that mi2 6\u2208 | ker \u03c1i1 |Z+ , i.e.\n| ker \u03c1i1 | \u2224 mi2 . This means that the corresponding funtion fi2 is not ker \u03c1i1 -invariant and\nker \u03c1i1 ) ker \u03c1i2 . Notice that F0 = F1 = * * * = Fi1 . The extension Fi2 /Fi1 = Fi2 /F1 is\nelementary abelian with Galois group ker \u03c1i1 / ker \u03c1i2 , but the element fi2 is not an element\nin Fi1 since it is not ker \u03c1i1 -invariant.\nThe result is proved the same way going up step by step in terms of Artin-Schreier\nextensions.\n\u0003\nRemark 23. The extensions Fi\u03bd +1 /Fi\u03bd can be described as an Artin-Schreier extensions.\nFor example if \u03bd = 1, with i1 6= 0, we have Gal(Fi1 +1 /F1 ) = \u2295h Z/pZ for each cyclic\ndirect summand of Gal(Fi1 +1 /F1 ). Notice that F0 = F1 = * * * = Fi1 . Then, for the\naction of \u03c3 \u2208 \u2295h Z/pZ on fi1 +1 we have:\nX\n\u03c3 l (fi1 +1 ) = fi1 +1 +\nc\u03bc (\u03c3)f\u03bc ,\n0\u2264\u03bc\u2264i1\n\nand c\u03bc (\u03c3) \u2208 k. We have that\n(4)\nand observe that\n\nP\n\n0\u2264\u03bc\u2264i1 c\u03bc (\u03c3)f\u03bc is ker \u03c11 -invariant. Thus, we set\n\nfi1 +1\n,\n0\u2264\u03bc\u2264i1 c\u03bc (\u03c3)f\u03bc\n\nYi1 +1 = P\n\n\u03c3\u03bdl (Yi1 +1 ) = Yi1 +1 + l.\nThis gives us that Yi1 +1 is a set of Artin-Schreier generators for the extension Fi1 +1 /F1\nand the elements Yi1 +1 satisfy equations of the form Yip1 +1 \u2212Yi1 +1 = ai1 for some element\nin ai1 \u2208 F1 = Fi1 . But actually we need only one extra generator fi1 +1 in order to express\nFi1 +1 = k(f1 , fi1 +1 ).\nRemark 24. Observe that Artin-Schreier extension P\ngiven by eq. (4) introduces more ramification primes. Indeed, every zero of the quantity 0\u2264\u03bc\u2264i1 c\u03bc (\u03c3)f\u03bc is a ramified prime\nin the extension Fi1 +1 /Fi1 . Also\nP the valuation of Yi1 +1 at the prime P in question is\nvP (Yi1 +1 ) = vP (fi1 +1 ) \u2212 vP ( 0\u2264\u03bc\u2264i1 c\u03bc (\u03c3)f\u03bc ).\n\nRemark 25. It seems natural to ask the following question: Let L/K be a Galois extension\nwith Galois group a p-group. Let P be a wild, totally ramified place of L. If a pole number\n\n\f8\n\nSOTIRIS KARANIKOLOPOULOS AND ARISTIDES KONTOGEORGIS\n\nin H(P ) is divisible by p, is it true that the corresponding element f \u2208 L is Gal(L/K)invariant? The answer to this question is negative as one sees by the following example:\nConsider the totally ramified elementary abelian extension of the rational function field\ngiven by the two Artin-Schreier extensions:\ny1p \u2212 y1 = f1 (x),\n\ny2p \u2212 y2 = f2 (x),\n\nwhere fi (x) \u2208 k[x] for i = 1, 2. Consider the Z/pZ-extensions of K1 := k(x, y1 ), K2 :=\nk(x, y2 ) of the rational function field. In those extensions only the infinite place \u221e of k(x)\nis ramified. Moreover it is known [39, Korollar 1] that the Weierstrass semigroups at the\nplaces of Ki that are above \u221e are pZ+ + mi Z+ respectively where mi = deg fi . We\nhave the following tower of fields and corresponding semigroups:\nk(x, y1 , y2 )\nMMM Z\nMMMpZ\nZ\nMMM\npZ\nM\nk(x, y1 )\nk(x, y2 )\nq\nq\nq\nq\nZ\npZ\nqqqZ\nqqq pZ\nk(x)\n\nH(P ) P\nPPP\nPPP\nPPP\nPPP\npZ+ + m1 Z+\npZ+ + m2 Z+\nnn\nn\nn\nnn\nn\nn\nnnn\nnnn\nZ+\n\nTherefore, the Weierstrass semigroup H(P ) of the place P of k(x, y1 , y2 ) that is above \u221e,\nhas p2 Z+ + pm1 Z+ + pm2 Z+ as a subsemigroup. We have div\u221e (yi ) = pmi but y2 is\nnot in k(x, y1 ), i.e., it is not Gal(k(x, y1 , y2 )/k(x, y1 ))-invariant. Suppose that m1 < m2 .\nRecently, [49] and [1] showed that the jumps of the ramification filtration occur at m1 and\nat m1 + p(m2 \u2212 m1 ).\nThe situation changes for the case of cyclic extensions of the rational function field as\nwill see in the next section.\n2.3. Cyclic totally ramified Galois extensions of function fields. We will need the following:\nProposition 26. Let Lm be a cyclic extension of the rational function field L0 = k(x)\nof degree pm . Assume also that every ramified place in the extension Lm /L0 is ramified\ncompletely. Then\n(1) there is a unique tower of intermediate fields\nk(x) = L0 \u2282 L1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Lm\u22121 \u2282 Lm\nsuch that [Lj : Lj\u22121 ] = p and this extension is given in terms of an Artin-Schreier\nextension\nLj = Lj\u22121 (yj ) :\nyjp \u2212 yj = Bj ,\nwhere Bj \u2208 Lj\u22121 has the following property (standard form):\nX\n\u03bbi,j Pi,j\u22121 ,\ndivBj = A \u2212\ni\n\nwith A prime to the pole divisor of Bj and \u03bbi,j is either zero or a positive integer\nprime to the characteristic p. Actually the integers \u03bbi,j are equal to the valuations\n\u2212\u03bbi,j = vPi,j\u22121 (Bj ) = vPi,j (yj ). In the above notation we are using the notation\nof [27], namely in Pi,j the index j indicates that this prime is a prime of the field\nLj , while the index i shows that lies above the i-th prime of L0 that ramifies.\nMoreover\n(2) The elements y1\u03b11 y2\u03b12 * * * yn\u03b1m form a basis of Lm over L0 , where 0 \u2264 \u03b1i < p.\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF CURVES AND WEIERSTRASS SEMIGROUPS\n\n9\n\n(3) For every ramified place P in Lm /L0 and integer a \u2208 N we have the decomposition:\nM\n\u0001\n\u03b1m\nL(aP ) =\nL(aP ) \u2229 y1\u03b11 y2\u03b12 * * * ym\nk(x) ,\n0\u2264a1 ,...,am <p\n\n\u03b1m\nwhere y1\u03b11 y2\u03b12 * * * ym\nk(x)\n\u03b11 \u03b12\n\u03b1m\nated by y1 y2 * * * ym\n.\n\ndenotes the 1-dimensional k(x)-vector space gener-\n\nProof. Part (1) is theorem 2 in [27], part (2) is lemma 3 in the same article and part (3) follows by observing that the divisor a\u22121 on page 311 can be replaced by any Gal(Lm /L0 )invariant divisor.\n\u0003\nDefinition 27. We will denote by G(i) the subgroup of G1 (P ) of order pm\u2212i .\nProposition 28. Fix a place Pi0 ,0 of the rational function field L0 that ramifies totally\nin the extension Lm /L0 . Then the set of places Pi0 ,j of Lj that are above Pi0 ,0 will be\ndenoted by Pj and \u03bbj = \u03bbi0 ,j , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m.\nLet HLj (Pj ) denote the Weierstrass semigroup at the place Pj of the function field Lj .\nWe have:\nHLj (Pj ) \u2286 pj Z+ + pj\u22121 \u03bb1 Z+ + * * * + \u03bbj Z+ ,\n\n(5)\nIn particular\n\nHLm (Pm ) \u2286 pm Z+ + pm\u22121 \u03bb1 Z+ + * * * + \u03bbm Z+\nIf moreover Pi0 ,0 is the only place that ramifies in the extension Lm /L0 then the above\ninclusions are equalities.\nProof. Assume that \u03bc < j and let y\u03bc the generator of L\u03bc over L\u03bc\u22121 . Observe that on\nthe function field Lj we have vPj (y\u03bc ) = \u2212pj\u2212\u03bc \u03bb\u03bc . According to prop. 26 part (3) every\n\u03b1m\nelement in \u222a\u03bd\u22651 L(\u03bdPm ) comes from an element of the form y1\u03b11 y2\u03b12 * * * ym\nf (x) and\nm\nm\u22121\nthese valuations at Pm form the semigroup p Z+ + p\n\u03bb1 Z+ + * * * + \u03bbm Z+ . Therefore\nHLm (Pm ) \u2286 pm Z+ + pm\u22121 \u03bb1 Z+ + * * * + \u03bbm Z+ .\nWe don't know if the elements yi have other poles so they may not be in L(\u03baPm ) for\nsome integer \u03ba. But if there is only one ramified point then the pole divisors of yi is\nsupported only at Pm and \u03bbi pm\u2212i is in the semigroup.\n\u0003\nUsing the description of Lm we are able to see the following\nProposition 29. If Gal(Lm /L0 ) is cyclic of order pm and H(P ) is the Weierstrass semigroup at a totally ramified point P of Lm , and div\u221e (f ) = aP for an integer a such that\np\u03ba | a then f is in Lm\u2212\u03ba , i.e. f is fixed by the unique subgroup of Gal(Lm /L0 ), of order\np\u03ba .\n\u03b1m\nProof. Using the valuation of elements of the form y1\u03b11 y2\u03b12 * * * ym\nwe see that if p\u03ba |\n\u03b11 \u03b12\n\u03b1m\na then f is a L0 linear combination of elements y1 y2 * * * ym with \u03b1m = * * * =\n\u03b1m\u2212(\u03ba\u22121) = 0 that are in Lm\u2212\u03ba .\n\u0003\n\nIn eq. (5) we introduced the sequence of numbers \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 < . . . corresponding to\nthe valuations of the generating elements yi of the field Lm . Is there any relation to the\nsequence m1 < m2 < . . . of pole numbers? What is the relation with the jumps of the\nrepresentation filtration?\nAssume that the jumps of the representation filtration appear at the integers j1 , j2 , . . . , jn ,\ni.e. ker \u03c1ji > ker \u03c1ji +1 for all i = 1, . . . , n. We have the following:\nG1 (P ) = ker \u03c11 = ker \u03c12 = * * * = ker \u03c1j1 > ker \u03c1j1 +1 = * * * = ker \u03c1r = {1}.\nNotice that the kernel of \u03c1r is trivial since \u03c1r is a faithful representation by proposition 3.\nObserve that the number of jumps in both the representation and the ramification filtrations\nis the same, since in both filtrations the elementary abelian quotients at indices where a\n\n\f10\n\nSOTIRIS KARANIKOLOPOULOS AND ARISTIDES KONTOGEORGIS\n\njump occur, are just cyclic groups of order p, therefore m, the number of jumps in the\nramification filtration, equals n, the number of jumps in the representation filtration. The\njumps at the representation filtration occur at j1 , j2 , . . . , jn , and ker \u03c1j\u03bd = G(\u03bd).\nLet j\u03bd be an index such that G(\u03bd) = ker \u03c1j\u03bd ! ker \u03c1j\u03bd +1 = G(\u03bd + 1). Since we are\nin the cyclic group case we have ker \u03c1j\u03bd / ker \u03c1j\u03bd +1 \u223c\n= Z/pZ. Let \u03c3 be a generator of the\nlater quotient. We can write the action on fj\u03bd +1 as\nX\nc\u03bc (\u03c3)f\u03bc .\n\u03c3fj\u03bd +1 = fj\u03bd +1 +\n\u03bc\u2264j\u03bd\n\nSince all f\u03bc , \u03bc \u2264 j\u03bd are \u03c3-invariant the element\nfj\u03bd +1\n\u03bc\u2264j\u03bd c\u03bc (\u03c3)f\u03bc\n\nYj\u03bd +1 = P\n\n(6)\n\nis acted on by \u03c3 as \u03c3Yj\u03bd +1 = Yj\u03bd +1 + 1, and it is an Artin-Schreier generator of the\nextension Fj\u03bd +1 /Fj\u03bd .\nDefinition 30. Consider a tower F = Fn \u2287 Fn\u22121 \u2287 * * * \u2287 F1 \u2287 F0 of fields. On this\ntower of fields we consider the sequence of jumps Fn ! Fjm ! Fjm\u22121 ! * * * ! Fj1 =\n* * * = F0 . In the notation of proposition 26 the fields Fj\u03bd +1 are just the fields L\u03bd . Fix a\nplace P of F and let Qi be the restriction of P on the field Fi . Notice that the places P\u03bd of\nL\u03bd defined in proposition 26 are equal to the places Qj\u03bd +1 .\nAn element fj \u2208 Fj can be seen as an element in all fields Fj \u2032 with j \u2032 \u2265 j. For j \u2265 i\nwe will denote by 0 > \u2212mj,i the valuation of fi as an element in Fj at the place Qj ,\nwhere the function fi corresponds to the pole number mi of H(P ). We are interested in\nthe elements fj\u03bd +1 , i.e. for the indices where a jump occurs in the representation filtration.\nNotice that since fj\u03bd +1 6\u2208 hfi : i \u2264 j\u03bd i the valuation vQj\u03bd +1 (fj\u03bd +1 ) is prime to p according\nto proposition 29. Therefore the number mj\u03bd +1,j\u03bd +1 is prime to p and we will denote it by\n\u03bc\u03bd+1 .\nWe compute using eq. (6)\nvQj\u03bd +1 (Yj\u03bd +1 ) =\n(7)\n\n=\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2212mj\u03bd +1,j\u03bd +1 \u2212 vQj\u03bd +1 \uf8ed\n\nX\n\n\u03bc\u2264j\u03bd\n\n\uf8f6\n\nc\u03bc (\u03c3)f\u03bc \uf8f8\n\n\u2212\u03bc\u03bd+1 + max{mj\u03bd ,\u03bc : c\u03bc (\u03c3) 6= 0}.\n\nNotice that \u03bbi,j the valuations of generators yj , of the fields given in the field tower of\nproposition 26 part (1), are prime to the characteristic from the standart form hypothesis.\nNotice also that there are \u03bd generators Yj\u03bd +1 . We will abuse the notation and denote with\nY\u03bd , 1 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 n the generators of the field extension Fj\u03bd +1 /Fj\u03bd . Now, since Y\u03bd and y\u03bd\nare both Artin-Schreier generators their valuation, which is prime to the characteristic\nfrom the discussion above, equals the conductor of the extension and must be equal, thus\nthe elements Y\u03bd and y\u03bd have the same valuation at Qj\u03bd +1 = P\u03bd . The absolute value of\nthe valuation computed in eq. (7) equals \u03bb\u03bd , where \u03bb\u03bd are the numbers introduced in\nproposition 28.\nCorollary 31. We keep the notation from definition 30. The valuations \u03bb\u03bd of the elements\ny\u03bd at Pj\u03bd satisfy \u03bb\u03bd \u2264 \u03bc\u03bd . Equality holds only if there is only one place P ramified in\nextension Fn /F0 , i.e., we are in the case of a Katz-Gabber cover with cyclic group of\norder pn .\nProof. The inequallity is a direct consequence of eq. (7). If \u03bb\u03bd = \u03bc\u03bd then all coefficients\nc\u03bc (\u03c3) \u03bc > 0 in eq. (7) are zero, i.e. only the coefficient c0 (\u03c3) of the constant function\nf0 can be non-zero. Then Y\u03bd = f\u03bd and there is only one place ramified in the extension\nF\u03bd+1 /F\u03bd .\n\u0003\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF CURVES AND WEIERSTRASS SEMIGROUPS\n\n11\n\nProposition 32. Let P be as in definition 30. The jumps of the ramification filtration at P\nare exactly at the the integers \u03bb\u03bd , where \u03bb\u03bd are the valuations of the elements y\u03bd at P\u03bd .\nProof. Observe that by [20, proof. Prop. 2.3], the integer \u03bb\u03bd equals the lower jump of\nthe representation filtration ker \u03c1j\u03bd / ker \u03c1j\u03bd +1 \u223c\n= Z/pZ (keep in mind that in that paper\nthe enumeration is decreasing). Notice that ker \u03c1j\u03bd = G(\u03bd) and ker \u03c1j\u03bd +1 = G(\u03bd + 1).\nThe ramification filtration of G(\u03bd) is given by G(\u03bd)\u03bc = G\u03bc (P ) \u2229 G(\u03bd). Observe that\nthe groups G(\u03bd) are elements of the ramification filtration therefore there is no need to\nconsider the upper ramification filtration, in order to relate the ramification filtrations of\nG1 (P ) and G1 (P )/G(\u03bd) [37, corollary after prop 3. IV.1], i.e.,\n(G1 (P )/G(\u03bd))j = Gj (P )/G(\u03bd).\nIn the same way we have\n\u0012\n\nG(\u03bd)\nG(\u03bd + 1)\n\n\u0013\n\nj\n\n=\n\nG(\u03bd)j\nGj (P ) \u2229 G(\u03bd)\n=\n.\nG(\u03bd + 1)\nG(\u03bd + 1)\n\nThis implies that \u03bb\u03bd are the jumps of the ramification filtration.\n\n\u0003\n\nExample 33. We consider now the case of a a cyclic group extension L/L0 of order pn\nwith only one full ramified place such that only L0 is rational.\nWe have the following tower of Z/pZ-cyclic extensions:\nL\n\nP\n\npn Z+ + pn\u22121 \u03bb1 Z+ + pn\u22122\n\u007f _ \u03bb2 Z+ + * * * + \u03bbn Z+\n\nL2 = LG(2)\n\nP2\n\n\u000f\np2 Z+ + p\u03bb1 Z\u007f + + \u03bb2 Z+\n_\n\nP1\n\n\u000f\npZ+ + \u007f \u03bb1 Z+\n_\n\nP0\n\n\u000f\nZ+\n\nZ\npZ\n\nL1 = LG(1)\nZ\npZ\n\nL0 = LG1 (P )\n\nThe place P is fully ramified in extension L/LG1(P ) and we will denote by Pi the corresponding place of LG(i) . The field LG1 (P ) is assumed to be rational and has Weierstrass\nsemigroup Z+ . The field LG(1) is an Artin-Schreier extension of LG1 (P ) and the Weiestrass semigroup at P1 has a part pZ+ coming as the semigroup of Z/pZ = G1 (P )/G(1)invariant elements plus a new non invariant element that is non divisible by p, the \u03bb1 Z+\nsemigroup. The Weierstrass semigroup at P1 is pZ+ + \u03bb1 Z+ .\nThe next step is to consider the Weierstrass semigroup of P2 . It has a part p2 Z+ +p\u03bb1 Z+\ncoming from the G(1)/G(2) \u223c\n= Z/pZ-invariant elements and also some extra elements that\nshould contain a semigroup of the form \u03bb2 Z+ , where (\u03bb2 , p) = 1. But eq. (5) gives us that\nH(P2 ) \u2286 p2 Z+ + p\u03bb1 Z+ + \u03bb2 Z+ and since there is a unique ramified place the above\ninclusion is actually an equality.\nThis way we can go all the way up to L and find that the Weierstrass semigroup is given\nby\nH(P ) = pn Z+ + pn\u22121 \u03bb1 Z+ + pn\u22122 \u03bb2 Z+ + * * * + \u03bbn Z+ .\n2.4. Holomorphic differentials in the cyclic totally ramified case. In this section we\nare going to use known bases for the space of holomorphic differentials in order to express\nthe gaps of the Weierstrass semigroups in terms of the Boseck invariants of the curves. In\n[17] we have defined Boseck invariants to be the values \u0393k (m) in definition 34 below and\nwe expressed the Galois module structure of holomorphic m-polydifferentials in terms of\nthem. Here we we omit the m from the notation since we are interested only for the m = 1\n\n\f12\n\nSOTIRIS KARANIKOLOPOULOS AND ARISTIDES KONTOGEORGIS\n\ncase. The motivation for their name was the work of Boseck [4] and in what follows we\nwill call them the Boseck invariants of the curve.\nWe assume that F is a cyclic, totally ramified extension of order pn of the rational\nfunction field.\nLet k be an integer with p-adic expansion\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nn\u22121\nk = a1 + a2 p + * * * + a(k)\n.\nn p\n\n(8)\na\n\n(k)\n\na\n\n(k)\n\na(k)\n\nThe set wk = y1 1 y2 2 * * * ynn , 0 \u2264 k \u2264 pn \u2212 1 is an k(x)-basis E-basis of F [47]. The\nvaluations of the basis elements wk are given by\nvPi,n (wk ) = \u2212\n\n(9)\n\nn\nX\n\n(k)\n\naj \u03bbi,j pn\u2212j ,\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the \u03bbi,j are given in proposition 26, part (1).\nWe denote the ramified places of k(x), with (x \u2212 \u03b1i ), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s, since in a rational function field every ramified place corresponds to an irreducible polynomial, which is\nlinear since the the field k is algebraically closed. We set\ngk (x) =\n\ns\nY\n\n(x \u2212 \u03b1i )\u03bdik (1) .\n\ni=1\nn\n\nDefinition 34. For k = 0, 1, . . . , p \u2212 1, we define\ns\nX\n\u03bdik ,\n\u0393k :=\ni=1\n\nwhere\n\u03bdik =\n\n(10)\n\n\u0016\n\n\u03b4i \u2212\n\nPn\n\n(k)\n\nj=1\n\naj \u03bbi,j pn\u2212j\n\npn\n\n\u0017\n\n,\n\nwhere \u03b4i denotes the different exponent \u03b4(Pi,n,\u03bc /(x \u2212 \u03b1i )) and the 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n runs over\nthe intermediate fields in the tower of proposition 26, part 1. Finally\n(11)\n\n(k)\n\n\u03c1i\n\n= \u03b4i \u2212\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0001\n(k)\naj \u03bbi,j pn\u2212j \u2212 \u03bdik * pn ,\n\nis the remainder of the division of the quantity \u03b4i + vPi,n (wk ) by pn .\nProposition 35. Let X be a cyclic extension of degree pn of the rational function field.\nThe set\nn\no\n(k)\n(\u03b1 )\n\u03c9k\u03bd i = (x \u2212 \u03b1i )\u03bd gk (x)\u22121 wk dx : 0 \u2264 \u03bd (k) \u2264 \u0393k \u2212 2, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 pn \u2212 2\n\nforms a basis for the set of holomorphic differentials for a cyclic extension of the rational\nfunction field of order pn .\nProof. We take the basis of [17, Lemma 10], set m = 1 and modify it in order to evaluate\nholomorphic differentials in the ramified primes of the extension. The same construction\nis given by Garcia in [7, Theorem 2, Claim] where the elementary abelian, totally ramified\ncase is studied. The proof is identical to the one given there.\n\u0003\nRemark 36. Observe from eq. (10) that if \u0393k = 0, then \u03bdik = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , r and\nthat could happen only when k = pn \u2212 1 since \u03bdik \u2265 0. Thus \u0393k 's attain the maximum\nvalue when k = 0, i.e \u03930 \u2265 \u0393k , for all 0 \u2264 k \u2264 pn \u2212 1 and for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 pn \u2212 2, we have\n(k)\nthat \u03c1i \u2264 pn \u2212 2.\nWe will need the following definition. For more information concerning the theory of\nlinear series the reader is referred to [42].\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF CURVES AND WEIERSTRASS SEMIGROUPS\n\n13\n\nDefinition 37. Let D be a linear series of degree d and dimension r, i.e., a linear subspace\nof P(L(E)). The linear series can be seen as a set of linear equivalent divisors. We can\nform a decreasing sequence\nDi (P ) = {D \u2208 D : D \u2265 iP }.\nThe sequence of (D, P )-orders is a sequence of integers:\nj0D (P ) < * * * < jrD (P ),\nsuch that Dj (P ) ! Dj+1 (P ) for all j in the above sequence.\nFor all but finite points of X the (D, P )-orders do not depend on P . The exceptional\npoints are called (D, P )-Weierstrass points.\nLet ED be the generic (D, P )-order sequence. We will call it the order sequence of the\nlinear series.\nA curve will be called classical with respect to the linear series D if and only if ED =\n{0, . . . , r}.\nWe have the following:\nProposition 38. Let X be a cyclic extension of degree pn of the rational function field. The\ngap sequence at the ramified primes Pi that lies over the place (x \u2212 \u03b1i ), with 0 \u2264 i \u2264 s of\nk(x) is given by\no\nn\n(k)\nG (Pi ) = \u03bd (k) * pn + \u03c1i + 1| 0 \u2264 k \u2264 pn \u2212 2, 0 \u2264 \u03bd (k) \u2264 \u0393k \u2212 2 ,\nwhere \u0393k is the Boseck invariant associated to the extension F/k(x).\nProof. This computation is based on the valuation of the elements in the basis of holo(k)\nmorphic differentials given in proposition 35. Let \u03c1i be as in Eq. (11). We denote by\nK\nK\nj (Pi ) = j the (K, Pi )-orders and K the canonical linear series. By computing the\nvaluations at Pi of the basis elements given in proposition 35, we are able to compute that\nthe (K, Pi ) orders are given by\no\nn\n(k)\n(12)\n\u03bd (k) * pn + \u03c1i | 0 \u2264 k \u2264 pn \u2212 2, 0 \u2264 \u03bd (k) \u2264 \u0393k \u2212 2 .\nIn the above computation it is essential to notice that for different values of k, \u03bd (k) 0 \u2264\n(k)\nk \u2264 pn \u2212 2, 0 \u2264 \u03bd (k) \u2264 \u0393k \u2212 2 the values \u03bd (k) * pn + \u03c1i are different, therefore the\nvaluation of a linear combination of the differentials in proposition 35, is just the minimal\nof the valuation of each summand. We know that knowledge of the (K, Pi )'s orders, is\nequivalent to the knowledge of the (0, Pi )'s gaps, i.e. the gap sequence at Pi will be given\nby j\u03bcK (P ) + 1.\nNotice that every element has a different valuation with respect to the place Pi . Notice\nalso that the dimension of the holomorphic differentials is g the same number as the number\nof the gaps. Also the n = 1 case was studied by Boseck in [4, Satz. 17]\n\u0003\nRemark 39. Boseck in his seminal paper [4, Satz 18], where the n = 1 case is studied,\nstates that as as k takes all the values 0 \u2264 k \u2264 p \u2212 2 the remainder of the Boseck's basis\n(k)\n(k)\nconstruction \u03c1i takes all the values 0 \u2264 \u03c1i \u2264 p\u22122 and thus all the numbers 1, . . . , p\u22121\nare gaps. This is not entirely correct as we will show in example 42. The problem appears\nif there is exactly one ramified place in the Galois extension.\nLemma 40. If all \u0393k \u2265 2 then all numbers 1, . . . , pn \u2212 1 are gaps. If there are Boseck\n(k)\ninvariants \u0393k = 1, then the set of gaps smaller than pn is exaclty the set {\u03c1i + 1| k : 0 \u2264\nk \u2264 pn \u2212 2, \u0393k \u2265 2}.\n\n\f14\n\nSOTIRIS KARANIKOLOPOULOS AND ARISTIDES KONTOGEORGIS\n(k)\n\nProof. Recall that in eq. (11) the elements \u03c1i were defined to be the remainder of the\nPn\n(k)\n(k)\ndivision of \u03b4i \u2212 j=1 aj \u03bbi,j pn\u2212j by pn . As k runs in 0 \u2264 k \u2264 pn \u2212 2 the \u03c1i run in\nn\n0, . . . , p \u2212 2. Indeed, let us define the function\n\u03a8 : {0, . . . , pn \u2212 2} \u2192 {0, . . . , pn \u2212 2},\n(k)\n\nk 7\u2192 \u03c1i .\nSince the expressions in eq. (12) are all different the function \u03a8 is onto.\nBut the \u0393k that are equal to 1 have to be excluded since they give not rise to a holomorphic differentials in proposition 35, see [17, Eq. (21)] and example 42.\n\u0003\nRemark 41. Notice that elements \u0393k = 1 can appear only for primes p \u2265 \u03bbi,j and\nonly if there is only one ramified place. But in our representation theoretic viewpoint the\ninteresting case is the one of small primes.\nExample 42. We consider the now the case of an Artin-Schreier extension of the function\nfield k(x), of the form y p \u2212 y = 1/xm . In this extension only the place (x \u2212 0) is ramified\nwith different exponent \u03b41 = (m + 1)(p \u2212 1). The Boseck invariants in this case are\n\u0016\n\u0017\n(m + 1)(p \u2212 1) \u2212 km\n\u0393k =\nfor k = 0, . . . , p \u2212 2.\np\nThe Weierstrass semigroup is known [39] to be mZ+ + pZ+ . Let us now try to find the\nsmall gaps by using lemma 40. If p < m then all numbers 1, . . . , p \u2212 1 are gaps. If\np > m then m is a pole number smaller than p. Indeed, \u0393p\u22122 = 1 and the remainder of the\ndivision of (m + 1)(p \u2212 1) \u2212 (p \u2212 2)m by p is \u03c1(p\u22122) = m \u2212 1. But then \u03c1(p\u22122) + 1 = m\nis not a gap.\nDefinition 43. In the literature, see Oliveira [31], semigroups H of genus g such the g-th\ngap is 2g \u2212 1 are called symmetric.\nA semigroup H is called symmetric, because the symmetry is expressed in the semigroup in the following way\n(13)\n\nn \u2208 H if and only if 2g \u2212 1 \u2212 n 6\u2208 H.\n\nLemma 44. Let X be a cyclic p-group extension of the rational function field with only one\ntotally ramified point Pi0 . The bigest gap is equal to (\u03930 \u2212 2)pn + \u03c1(0) + 1 = \u03b4 \u2212 2pn + 1\nand the Weierstrass semigroup at that point is symmetric.\nProof. Since there is only one ramified place \u03bdi0 k = \u0393k . From remark 36 and proposition\n38 we see that the biggest gap is equal to (\u03930 \u2212 2)pn + \u03c1(0) + 1 = \u03b4 \u2212 2pn + 1, where\n\u03b4 is the different exponent at the unique ramified place\nj and\nk is equal to the degree of the\n\u03b4\ndifferent. For the last equality keep in mind that \u03930 = pn and \u03b4 = pn \u03930 + \u03c1(0) .\nA direct computation with Riemann\u2013Hurwitz formula, shows that\n2g \u2212 1 = \u22122pn + 1 + \u03b4,\n\u0003\n\nhence the semigroup is symmetric.\n\nDoes lemma 44 holds for the general case when we have more than one totally ramified\nprimes? The answer is no, in general, but the following lemma gives a necessary and\nsufficient condition for this.\nLemma 45. Assume that X is as in lemma 44 but now there are s \u2265 2 totaly ramified\nplaces Pi , with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s. Let \u03b4i denote the different exponent at the prime i. The\nsemigroup at some ramified place Pi is symmetric if and only if\nX\nX \u0016 \u03b4i\u2032 \u0017\nn\n\u2032\n(14)\n.\n\u03b4i = p\npn\n\u2032\n\u2032\ni 6=i\n\ni 6=i\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF CURVES AND WEIERSTRASS SEMIGROUPS\n\n15\n\nMoreover, let \u03bbi,j be the valuations of the genarators of the field extensions given in Proposition 26 part (1). Then eq. (14) holds if and only if \u03bbi\u2032 \u2261 \u22121 modpn for all i\u2032 6= i.\nProof. Fix an i. Then from remark 36 and proposition 38, we see that the biggest gap at\n(0)\nPi is (\u03930 \u2212 2)pn + \u03c1i + 1 and using one more time the Riemann\u2013Hurwitz formula, we\nsee that this gap equals to 2g \u2212 1 is equivalent to the condition\ns\nX\n(0)\n\u03b4i\u2032 \u2212 2pn + 1.\n(15)\n(\u03930 \u2212 2)pn + \u03c1i + 1 =\ni\u2032 =1\n\nNow since \u03930 =\n\nPs\n\ni\u2032 =1\n\nj\n\n\u03b4i\u2032\npn\n\nk\n\n, the left hand of eq.

Let X be as in lemmata 44,45, i.e. assume that there exists a Pi0 that\nis totally ramified and that its Weierstrass semigroup is symmetric. Then the Weierstrass\nsequence up to 2g, at the place Pi0 that lies over the place (x \u2212 \u03b1i0 ), is given by\nH(Pi0 ) = {2g \u2212 1 \u2212 a|a \u2208 G (Pi0 )},\nwhere G (Pi0 ) is the gap sequence at Pi0 from proposition 38.\nProof. This is a direct consequence of lemmata 44, 45 and eq. (13).\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 47. In the theory of numerical semigroups the following construction is frequently used in order to describe the semigroup [29]: Let d(P ) be the least positive element of H(P ).

If H = d1 Z+ +d2 Z+\nthen (d1 \u2212 1)(d2 \u2212 1) \u2212 1 is a gap and n = (d1 \u2212 1)(d2 \u2212 1).\n\u0003\nLet mi be the sequence that enumerates the Weierstrass semigroup, m0 = 0 is always\na pole number. Observe that if 2g \u2212 1 6\u2208 H(P ) then n = 2g. Indeed, we know that\nif the function field F is not hyperelliptic then mi \u2265 2i + 1 for i = 1, . . . , g \u2212 2 and\nmg\u22121 \u2265 2g \u2212 2 [42, lemma 1.25]. This means that we have two cases for mg\u22121 , namely\neither mg\u22121 = 2g \u2212 2 or mg\u22121 = 2g \u2212 1.\nLet K be the canonical linear series. Observe that at a generic point P of a K\u2013classical\ncurve X, we have mi (P ) = g + i, for i \u2265 1. In that case the gaps G (P ) and the generic\norder sequence E (P ) are classical and they are equal to\nG (P ) = {1, . . . , g} and E (P ) = {0, . . . , g \u2212 1}.\nIn what follows assume that mg\u22121 = 2g \u2212 2 at a point P of the curve. Notice that this\ncondtition implies that the maximum gap at P equals to 2g \u2212 1. Therefore this leads to the\nstudy where the curve must satisfy at least one of the following conditions:\n(1) the curve is not K-classical,\n(2) P is a Weierstrass point.\nIn fact there is more to say. A more carefull analisys indicates that if mg\u22121 = 2g \u2212 2,\nthen the second condition, i.e. P should be a Weierstrass point, is always satisfied. Indeed,\nwe distinguish the following cases:\nCase1.: The curve X is not K-classical and P is ordinary, meaning that 2g \u2212 1 \u2208\nG (P ) 6= {1, . . . , g} and\nK\nK\nG (P ) = {\u01ebK\n0 + 1, . . . , \u01ebg\u22121 + 1} = {ji (P ) + 1| 0 \u2264 i \u2264 g \u2212 1}.\nK\nThus, we must have that \u01ebK\ng\u22121 = 2g \u2212 2 = jg\u22121 (P ); This case cannot occur, see [42,\nLemma 2.31 p.30.], [8].\nCase 2.: The point P is a Weierstrass point with respect to K, and X is a K-classical\ncurve. That is 2g \u2212 1 \u2208 G (P ) 6= {1, . . . , g},\n\nG (P ) = {jiK (P ) + 1| 0 \u2264 i \u2264 g \u2212 1} 6= {\u01ebK\ni + 1| 0 \u2264 i \u2264 g \u2212 1},\nK\nK\nwhere jg\u22121\n(P ) = 2g \u2212 2 but \u01ebK\ng\u22121 = g \u2212 1 6= jg\u22121 (P ).\nCase 3.: The point P is a Weierstrass point with respect to K and the curve X is not\nK\nK\u2013classical. That is g \u2212 1 < \u01ebK\njg\u22121\n(P ).\ng\u22121\nWe have proved the following:\n\nProposition 50. If a curve has symmetric Weierstrass semigroup at a point P , then this\npoint is a Weierstrass point. Moreover if the Weierstrass semigroup at this point is generated by two elements, d1 , d2 , i.e. when we have equality in lemma 49, eq. (18), the genus\nof the curve is given by\n(d1 \u2212 1)(d2 \u2212 1)\n.\ng=\n2\nIf the Weierstrass semigroup at this point cannot be generated by two elements, then\n(d1 \u2212 1)(d2 \u2212 1)\n.\ng<\n2\n\n\f18\n\nSOTIRIS KARANIKOLOPOULOS AND ARISTIDES KONTOGEORGIS\n\nExample 51. Consider the case of Artin\u2013Schreier curve defined in example 42 or the most\ngeneral case\ny q \u2212 y = f,\n(where f is a polynomial of degree m witch is prime to p, and q = ph ) have genus g =\n(q\u22121)(m\u22121)\n. Therefore, using the theory of Boseck invariants we see that the biggest gap\n2\nis\n\u03b4 \u2212 2q + 1 = (m + 1)(q \u2212 1) \u2212 2q + 1 = (m \u2212 1)(q \u2212 1) \u2212 1 = 2g \u2212 1,\nand n = 2g.\nTo the same conclusion we arrive using lemma 49. Indeed, it is known [39] that the\nWeierstrass semigroup is generated by m, q. Thus n = (q \u2212 1)(m \u2212 1) = 2g.\nObserve that certain function fields like the Hermitian function fields and their quotients\ny q + y = xm , m | q + 1, q = ph , satisfy 2n = g. Also Matignon-Lehr curves given by\n[23, 4.1], are given as Artin-Schreier extensions of the rational function field and satisfy\n2n = g. Moreover if k = Fq2 , where Fq2 is a finite field with q 2 elements, then Hermitian\nand their quotients y q + y = xm , m | q + 1, are certain maximal curves and can be viewed\nas the Artin-Schreier curves y q \u2212y = f (x), where f (x) \u2208 Fq2 [x] and g.c.d.(deg f, p) = 1,\nsee [11, Theorem 5.4].\nHere it is nice to point out the connection of maximal curves with Weierstrass semigroups: Assume that X is a maximal curve over Fq2 of genus g. Let X(Fq2 ) be the set of\nall Fq2 \u2013rational points of X. Let also P be a point in X(Fq2 ) and let mi = mi (P ) be a\npole number at P .\nThen according to Lewittes, [26, th 1(b)],[5, p.46 ]\n#X(Fq2 ) = N \u2264 q 2 mi + 1.\nCombining the above with the Hasse-Weill bound for a maximal curve, we obtain the\nfollowing bound (mi is any pole number)\n#X(Fq2 ) = q 2 + 1 + 2gq \u2264 q 2 mi + 1,\nor\n\nq(mi \u2212 1)\n.\n2\nIf mi = q the above is a result due to Ihara's, [16] and the equality is obtained when X\nis the Hermitian curve. Notice that if P is Fq2 rational point then q, q + 1 are always pole\nnumbers, [5, proposition 1.5,(iv)].\ng\u2264\n\n4. H ASSE -W ITT MATRIX\n\nAND SEMIGROUPS\n\nIn [41] K.O. St\u00f6hr and P.Viana introduced a completely local construction of the HasseWitt matrix [15]. One of their results that will be useful to us is the following\nProposition 52. Let (aij ) be the Hasse-Witt matrix and consider the product\nr\u22121\n\np\nAr := (aij )(apij ) * * * (aij\n\n)\n\nLet P be any point in the curve in question. For each positive r the rank of the matrix Ar\nis larger than or equal to the number of gaps at divisible by pr .\nProof. [41, cor. 2.7]\n\n\u0003\n\nNotice that (aij ) is dual to the Cartier operator and the matrix Ar corresponds to the\napplication of r-times of the corresponding p-linear map. For more information concerning\nthe Hasse-Witt matrix and the Cartier operator we refer to [3]. The rank of Ar equals the\nrank of the Cartier Operator.\nAlso notice that if the rank is zero, then there are no gaps divisible by pr and every\nnumber divisible by pr is a pole number. This can also be seen by different methods, see\n[32].\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF CURVES AND WEIERSTRASS SEMIGROUPS\n\n19\n\nRemark 53. The p-rank of the Jacobian is the rank of the matrix Ag . Having p-rank zero\ndoes not give us any information about pole numbers since every number greater than 2g\nis a pole number. For this notice that for p \u2265 5 we have 2g < pg .\nProposition 54. If a curve has Hasse-Witt matrix zero then every integer divisible by p is\na pole number. This implies that G1 (P ) is at most an extension of an elementary abelian\ngroup with a cyclic group of order p.\nProof. If there was a pole number m such that m < p then G1 (P ) is faithfully represented\nin L(mP ) and it should be elementary abelian. If p < m, then m1 = p and by lemma\n9 we have that ker \u03c11 divides p therefore ker \u03c11 is either trivial or isomorphic to a cyclic\ngroup of order p. The group G1 (P ) is given by a short exact sequence\n1 \u2192 ker \u03c11 \u2192 G1 (P ) \u2192 V \u2192 1\nwhere V is an elementary abelian group.\n\n\u0003\n\nExample 55. A classical example of a curve with nillpotent Cartier operator is given by\nthe Hermitian curve\nr\nr\ny p + y = xp +1 ,\nr\nr\n(which is isomorphic to the Fermat curve xp +1 + y p +1 + 1 = 0), with Cartier operator\nr\nsatisfying C = 0 [32].\nCorollary 56. If X has Hasse-Witt matrix zero, and is a big action then G2 (P ) is cyclic\nof order p.\nProof. If the first pole number is not divisible by p, then we have a faithful two dimensional\nrepresentation of G1 (P ) on L(mr P ), so G1 (P ) is elementary abelian, therefore bounded\nby a linear bound on g [30]. The first pole number is divisible by p since the Hasse-Witt\nmatrix is assumed to be zero. Also the first pole number is m1 = |G2 (P )| by lemma 18.\nThus, G2 (P ) is a cyclic group of order p.\n\u0003\nCorollary 57. Let X be a curve of genus g \u2265 2. If the curve X has nilpotent Cartier\noperator, i.e., C l = 0, and moreover pl \u2264 g, then the curve is non-classical with respect\nto the canonical linear series. Moreover all curves with zero Cartier operator that are\nequipped with an automorphism group that has a wild ramified point and g 6= p \u2212 1,\nare non-classical with respect to the canonical linear series with only one hyperelliptic\nexception, namely y 2 = xp \u2212 x.\nProof. Recall that a curve is classical for the canonical divisor if and only if the gap sequence for a non Weierstrass point is given by {1, 2, . . . , g}. Proposition 52 implies that\npl is a pole number. Since pl \u2264 g the curve can't be classical.\nAssume now that the curve X has an automorphism group G such that there is a wild\nramified point in the cover X \u2192 X/G, and has zero Cartier operator. Therefore l = 1,\nand according to [34] the existence of wild ramification forces p \u2212 1 \u2264 g or the curve is the\nhyperelliptic curve y 2 = xp \u2212 x. For the case p \u2212 1 < g the result follows. We don't know\nwhat happens for the g = p \u2212 1 case (for small primes, p < 5, these curves are classical\nbecause they satisfy the criterion in eq. (21) below).\nThe hyperelliptic curve y 2 = xp \u2212 x is a curve of genus g = (p \u2212 1)/2 and it is also an\nArtin-Schreier extension of the rational function field. In [43] it is proved that this curve\nhas zero Cartier operator. In fact this is the superspecial hyperelliptic curve with the biggest\npossible genus (see [2, Theorem 1.2]). It is well known that all the hyperelliptic curves of\narbritrary characteristic are K\u2013classical, [36, Satz 8].\n\u0003\nNotice that all superspecial hyperelliptic curves X are K\u2013classical and they satisfy the\ncriterion given in the following equation\n(21)\n\np > deg K = 2g \u2212 2, =\u21d2 Xis classical with respect to K,\n\n\f20\n\nSOTIRIS KARANIKOLOPOULOS AND ARISTIDES KONTOGEORGIS\n\n(see for instance [22, Theorem 15] and [48, prop. 14.2.64, p.561]), since from [2, Theorem\n1.2] their genera are upper bounded by p\u22121\n2 . Moreover when chark = 0 or when eq. (21)\nis valid then X is K\u2013classical.\nThe remarkable fact is that neither of the wild ramified coverings X \u2212\u2192 X/G, with\nX being classical or not with respect to the canonical linear series, satisfy equation 21 for\ng \u2265 3 (the reader should exclude the hyperelliptic exceptional case considered in corollary\n57). This statement follows from the simple facts that for these curves p \u2264 g + 1, and\n2g \u2212 2 \u2265 g + 1 for every g \u2265 3. Keep also in mind that there do not exist non K\u2013classical\ncurves for g \u2264 3, with only one exception for p = g = 3, see [19].\nRemark 58. Corollary 57, restricted to the the world of maximal curves is similar to the\nconstruction [5, proposition 1.7.]. Indeed, from theorem 3.3 in [11], every maximal and\nminimal curve over Fq2 , q = pl have nilpotent Cartier operator with C l = 0. The small\ndifference in the lower bound that is given there, pl \u2212 1 \u2264 g is explained because if X is\nclassical and g = pl \u2212 1 then m1 = pl and from [5, proposition 1.5 and the remark just\nbefor this] this curve should be the Hermitian, that is a contradiction since the Hermitian\nl\nl\ncurve has genus p (p2 \u22121) . Observe also that the genus of the nilpotent curves is bounded\nby\npl (pl \u2212 1)\n,\n2\nwhere l is the rank of nilpotency [32, th. 4.1].\ng\u2264\n\n(22)\n\nRemark 59. Combining the results from proposition [5, Proposition 1.10], lemma 49 here,\nand [21, theorem 2.5], we get the following:\nConsider a maximal curve over Fq2 , with genus g \u2265 2 and the set \u03a3 of Fq2 -rational\npoints such that the Weierstrass semigroup up to q + 1, and hence all the Weierstrass\nsemigroup, is generated by two integers. Then the Weierstrass semigroup at all points of\n\u03a3 is symmetric, i.e. their max gap is always at 2g \u2212 1.\nSince q, q + 1 must always be in the Weierstrass semigroup at such a point, this condition to the numbers of generators, corresponds to the minimum number of generators that\na maximal curve can have. Thus we can rephrase:\nThe maximal curves over Fq2 with minimal set of generators for their Weierstrass semigroups at a Fq2 \u2013rational point, have symmetric Weierstrass semigroups at this point.\nThe next proposition shows that the condition on the number of generators of the Weierstrass semigroup in a Fq2 -rational point is not necessary so that the point has symmetric\nWeierstrass semigroup.\nProposition 60. Let XGK be the maximal curve over Fq2 defined in Giulietti\u2013Korchm\u00e1ros,\n[13]. Then the Weierstrass semigroup at the rational point X\u221e is symmetric. This is an\nexample of curve where the equality in proposition 50 fails.\nProof. We will use the notation from [13]. Let n = ph , p a prime, h \u2265 1 and q = n3 .\nFrom [13, equation 10, p. 236], we can write\n\u0013\n3 \u0012\nX\ndi\u22121\n\u2212 1 \u03b1i\n2gGK \u2212 1 =\ndi\ni=1\n(23)\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u03b11 + (n2 \u2212 n)\u03b12 + (n \u2212 1)\u03b13 ,\n\nwhere \u03b11 = n3 \u2212 n2 + n, \u03b12 = n3 , \u03b13 = n3 + 1, are the generators of H(X\u221e ), [13,\nproposition 5], d0 = 0, d1 = \u03b11 , d2 = g.c.d.(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ), and d3 = g.c.d.(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 ).\nSuppose now that 2gGK \u2212 1 is a pole number. From [13, lemma 5] there are uniquely\ndetermined no negative integers ji , with i = 1, . . . 3 and j1 , j2 \u2264 n2 \u2212 n, j3 \u2264 n \u2212 1 such\nthat\n2gGK \u2212 1 = \u03b11 j1 + \u03b12 j2 + \u03b13 j3 .\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF CURVES AND WEIERSTRASS SEMIGROUPS\n\n21\n\nFrom eq. 23 this is equivalent to\n(j1 + 1)\u03b11 + j2 \u03b12 + j3 \u03b13 = (n2 \u2212 n)\u03b12 + (n \u2212 1)\u03b13\nwhich shows that j2 = n2 \u2212 n, j3 = n \u2212 1, j1 = \u22121, a contradiction!\nFrom [13, theorem 2], we have that 2gX = (n3 + 1)(n2 \u2212 2) + 2. With an immediate\ncalculation we show that 2gX < (\u03b11 \u2212 1)(\u03b12 \u2212 1). Indeed, notice that (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = n so we\ncan not apply lemma 49. However we can show that 2gGK < (\u03b11 \u2212 1)(\u03b13 \u2212 1) since the\nright hand of the inequality is greater that (\u03b11 \u22121)(\u03b12 \u22121). Also 2gGK \u2264 (\u03b12 \u22121)(\u03b13 \u22121)\nsince otherwise XGK is Hermitian, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nRemark 61. Let X be the Hermitian, or the Garcia\u2013Stichtenoth curve, [9], or the Giulietti\u2013\nKorchm\u00e1ros maximal curve over Fq2 , q = ph . In fact these are three of the five known\nfamilies of maximal curves over Fq2 (in the sense that every known maximal curve arise\nas an Fq2 \u2013cover of these curves). The other two families are the Deligne\u2013Lusztig curves\nthat are Fq2 maximal curves with q being a certain power of three and two respectively\n(see [13, introduction]). Then X has symmetric Weierstrass semigroups in a Fq2 rational\npoint P . The Hermitian and the Garcia\u2013Stichtenoth curves are examples where we obtain\nthe equality in proposition 50.\nIndeed, Hermitian and the Garcia\u2013Stichtenoth curves have symmetric Weierstrass semigroups in Fq2 rational points because there are Artin\u2013Schreier curves, thus the Weierstrass\nsemigroup in a Fq2 rational point is generated by 2 elements. From remark 59, the Weierstrass semigroup in any rational point is symmetric. For the Hermitian case, we have that\n. For the Garcia\u2013\nthe generators of H(P ) are d1 = q, d2 = q + 1 and thus gH = q(q\u22121)\n2\n2\n2\n2 \u22121)\nStichtenoth curve y l \u2212 y = xl \u2212l+1 , d1 = l2 \u2212 l + 1, d2 = l2 and gGC = (d1 \u22121)(d\n,\n2\n[9, theorem 1]. The assertion for the Giulietti\u2013Korchm\u00e1ros maximal curve comes from\nproposition 60.\nRemark 62. Let X be the Hermitian, or the Garcia\u2013Stichtenoth curve, or the Giulietti\u2013\nKorchm\u00e1ros maximal curve over Fq2 . Denote by P \u2208 X the Fq2 \u2013rational place where\nH(P ) is symmetric and with F its function field. Take G to be a p subgroup of the automorphism group of X. Take the Galois cover \u03c0 : X \u2212\u2192 X/G and suppose that there is\nonly one place ramified in that cover. We will prove that the Weierstrass semigroup at P is\nsymmetric if and only if the Weierstrass semigroup at the point \u03c0(P ) is symmetric.\nSince every p-group is solvable we can decompose the cover \u03c0 to a sequence of ArtinSchreier covers. So it is enough to consider the case of covers of the form F = F0 (y)\nwhere\n(24)\n\nh\n\ny p \u2212 y = f, where f \u2208 F0 ,\n\nand f has a unique pole at the rational place \u03c0(P ) of F0 , with vP0 (f ) = \u2212m < 0.\nThen F/F0 is totally ramified at the place P , with P |\u03c0(P ). Notice that the conditions of\nLewittes theorem, 19 here, are satisfied. Now we can say the following: Lewittes showed\nthat if gX/G = 0 then H(P ) is symmetric; If gX/G > 0 and H(\u03c0(P )) is symmetric then\nH(P ) is symmetric, see [25, p.36 after corollary].\nNow we will prove that if H(P ) is symmetric then H(\u03c0(P )) is symmetric. According\nto Lewittes, theorem 19 here, the max gap in P which equals to 2gX \u2212 1 is given by\n2gX \u2212 1 =\n(25)\n\nm(ph \u2212 1) + ph hgX/G\n\n=\n\n(m + 1)(ph \u2212 1) + ph hgX/G \u2212 ph + 1\n\n=\n\ndeg Diff + ph (hgX/G \u2212 1) + 1.\n\nCombining eq. (25) and Riemann\u2013Hurwitz formula we should have that hgX/G = 2gX/G \u2212\n1, and that means that the Weierstrass semigroup at \u03c0(P ) is also symmetric.\nNotice that \u03c0(P ) is also an Fq2 rational point from the transitivity of the relative degrees. Finally notice that all the curves considered by Stichtenoth\u2013Garcia\u2013Xing in [10,\n\n\f22\n\nSOTIRIS KARANIKOLOPOULOS AND ARISTIDES KONTOGEORGIS\n\nSection 3, Theorem 3.2] (see also [9, theorem 2, m = 1 case]), have symmetric Weierstrass semigroups at \u03c0(P ).\nR EFERENCES\n1.
