Zeeman-splitting\nmeasurements require high sensitivity and a by-product of this survey is a set of sensitive emission/absorption line data for 79 sources from which spin temperatures and other information can\nbe gleaned.\nIn \u00a72 we discuss Arecibo's instrumental effects and introduce a least-squares technique to\naccount for both them and for angular derivatives of the HI emission. In \u00a73 we discuss the radiative\ntransfer of the two-component (warm and cold) HI and define our technique of Gaussian fitting as\na practical means to treat radiative transfer in a physically correct but simple model. \u00a74 discusses\nthe practical implementation of the Gaussian fitting process and the associated difficulties and\nuncertainties. \u00a75 compares our method with a previous method for dealing with the radiative\ntransfer, the \"slope method\". \u00a76 is a brief summary of the paper. Heiles (2001a) presented a\npreliminary report of the astrophysical implications of our Gaussian components on the WNM and\nCNM; Paper II (Heiles & Troland 2002) presents the complete discussion.\n1\n\nThe Arecibo Observatory is part of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, which is operated by Cornell\nUniversity under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.\n\nEXTRACTING EXPECTED AND OPACITY PROFILES FROM ARECIBO\nDATA\n2.1.\n\nThe ON-OFF spectrum\n\nIn the presence of a continuum source that provides antenna temperature Tsrc , the on-source\nantenna temperature is\nTsrc (\u03bd) = Texp (\u03bd) + Tsrc e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Texp (\u03bd) is the \"expected profile\", which is the emission that would be observed in the absence\nof the source, and \u03c4 (\u03bd) is the 21-cm line opacity; both of these are functions of frequency because\nof the spectral line. The appended symbols (\u03bd) indicate frequency-dependent quantities within the\nprofile; unappended temperatures are continuum. In this paper, all temperatures are (Stokes I/2)\nbecause they are the average of measurements in orthogonal polarizations.\nConsider equation 1 and assume, for the moment, that the spatial derivatives are zero. Then\nthe two unknowns Texp (\u03bd) and e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) are easily separated observationally by taking on-source\nand off-source measurements, for which Tsrc changes from zero to the full source intensity. More\ngenerally the spatial derivatives are nonzero; using the on source and off source measurements, we\ninclude spatial derivatives to write a more complicated version of equation 1 and subject it to a least\nsquares analysis, as discussed in detail in \u00a72.6. By this procedure, the expected emission profile\nTexp (\u03bd) and the opacity profile e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) (and, in addition, the spatial derivatives) are well-determined.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Arecibo telescope and electronics\n\nThe Arecibo telescope has a reflector fixed on the ground and points by moving the feed\nstructure. This makes many characteristics of the beam change as a source is tracked. These changes\nare discussed by Heiles et al (2001a) and documented in more detail on Arecibo's website. We\nsampled two linearly polarized channels simultaneously, performing both auto and crosscorrelations\nwith Arecibo's three-level \"interim\" digital correlator, to generate and instrumentally correct all\nfour Stokes parameters in the manner discussed by Heiles (2001) and Heiles et al (2001b).\nWe observed each source by repeating many times an observational pattern. A \"pattern\"\nconsists of a sequence of J \"measurements\" at fixed, defined, different sky positions (denoted\nby subscript j) relative to the source observed for prescribed times. We designed the patterns\nto measure the first and second derivatives of intensity on the sky so that we could correct for\ninstrumental effects as described below. Each pattern contains one or more on-source measurements\nand at least four off-source measurements. The total integration time for a given source consists of\nN patterns (denoted by subscript n).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThe on-source antenna temperature can vastly exceed the off-source one. With three-level\ncorrelators it is important to keep the input level at the optimum value; this meant that the\nelectronics gains for the on-source measurements (Gn below) were set lower than those for the offsource ones (Gn below). These gains, which are functions of n but not of j, had to be calibrated\nindependently and have independent uncertainties.\nFor each source we repeated a pattern N times. Each pattern is characterized by its own gains,\nso we have N values of G and G; we denote individual ones by the subscript n, e.g. Gn .\n2.3.\n\nThe observing technique\n\nWe have two patterns for observing. One, called Z4, generates four off-source emission spectra\nand the on-source spectrum. The four allow determination of the first derivative of the emission\nline in the sky. The other pattern, called Z16, generates sixteen off-source emission spectra and the\non-source spectrum (Figure 1). The sixteen allow determination of not only the first derivative of\nthe emission line in the sky, but all second derivatives. The following details must be accounted\nfor in the data reduction:\n1. The on-source electronics gain Gn for each pattern n is not perfectly calibrated.\n2. The off-source electronics gain Gn for each pattern n is not perfectly calibrated.\n3. The on-axis gain (\"Kelvins per Jansky\") [K Jy\u22121 ]n of the telescope changes with (az, za), so\nthat the source deflection changes. This quantity is known from previous calibration data;\nwe adopt it from a table lookup.\n\u2217\n4. The off-source cold-sky system temperature TR,n\nchanges with za (but not by much). Our\nnotation, with the subscript R, implies \"Receiver\" temperature, but this is not quite correct.\nRather, it is the off-source cold-sky system temperature, which is the actual receiver temperature plus other sources of cold-sky noise including, specifically, the cosmic background\n\u2217\nradiation and also the za-dependent contribution from the ground; TR,n\ndepends on (az, za)\nand is known from previous calibration data. We do not measure it explicitly, but rather\nadopt it from a table lookup.\n\n5. Arecibo's beam shape changes with (az, za). In particular, the location of the first zero in\nthe antenna beam response changes and, moreover, does not always exist. This means that\nthe off-source spectra contain some remnant of the source intensity so one cannot obtain the\nexpected profile by going just a little way off source.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.4.\n\nObtaining the continuum source flux and antenna temperatures\n\nIn this and future sections we need to distinguish between measured qauantities and true\nquantities. The difference arises from the fact that the gain calibrations (G and G) are imperfect.\nThe measured quantities are denoted by the superscript m and the true quantities by \u2217. For\nsystem temperatures (equations 2 below), the measured and true quantities are related by gain\nfactors in the sense that the gain factor multiplied by the true quantity equals the measured one.\nAntenna temperatures are derived from system temperatures by subtracting a table-lookup receiver\ntemperature (equations 4 below), so the relationship is more complicated. Measured quantities also\nhave random noise, but in the following we temporarily assume they are noise-free so that we can\nm = GT \u2217 .\nwrite (schematically) Tsys\nsys\nFor a particular off-source position j within pattern n, we directly measure the system temm\nperature Tsys,n,j\n, which is\nm\n\u2217\nTsys,n,j\n= Gn Tsys,n,j\n\n(2a)\n\nand, correspondingly for the on-source position (denoted by j = s),\nm\n\u2217\nTsys,n,s\n= Gn Tsys,n,s\n\n(2b)\n\nThe off-source antenna temperature, i.e. the excess response of the telescope over cold sky, includes\nthe response to the source (which might enter through sidelobes) as well as any diffuse emission\nthat happens to lie in the same direction and is simply\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nTant,n,j\n= Tsys,n,j\n\u2212 TR,n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nWe define the measured antenna temperatures as\nm\nm\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nTant,n,j\n\u2261 Tsys,n,j\n\u2212 TR,n\n= Gn Tsys,n,j\n\u2212 TR,n\n\n(4a)\n\nwith the corresponding equation for the on-source position, for which we define the on-source\nantenna temperature to be the source temperature Tsrc,n :\nm\nm\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nTsrc,n\n\u2261 Tsys,n,s\n\u2212 TR,n\n= Gn Tsys,n,s\n\u2212 TR,n\n.\n\n(4b)\n\nWe derive the source flux by assuming that all of the antenna temperature, including that portion\nthat comes from unrelated diffuse emission, arises from the source, i.e. we define\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nSsrc \u2261\n\n\u2217\nTsrc,n\n\n[K Jy\u22121 ]n\n\n=\n\nm\nTsys,n,s\nGn\n\n\u2217\n\u2212 TR,n\n\n[K Jy\u22121 ]n\n\n(5)\n\nExcept for Gn , the quantities on the right hand side are known from our data or from previous\ncalibration. The gains Gn are randomly distributed with |Gn \u2212 1| \u226a 1, so G1n is also randomly\ndistributed. Therefore, from the set of N patterns we obtain the best estimate for Ssrc from a least\nsquares fit of the N equations\nm\n\u2217\n[K Jy\u22121 ]n Ssrc = Tsys,n,s\n\u2212 TR,n\n,\n\n(6)\n\ni.e., by assuming all Gn = 1.\nHaving performed the least squares fit, we rewrite equation 5 to solve for the unknown Gn :\nGn =\n\nm\nTsys,n,s\n\u2217\n[K Jy\u22121 ]n Ssrc + TR,n\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nAll quantities on the right-hand side are known, so this explicitly provides the value for each Gn\nm\nfor each pattern, allowing us to correct the individual on-source measurements Tsys,n,s\nfor the gain\nerror (but not the off-source measurements; see \u00a72.6).\n2.5.\n\nThe meaning of our derived source fluxes\n\nWe derive the source flux Ssrc with equation 5. In essence, this averages the difference between\nm\nand the predicted cold-sky antenna temperatures\nthe Gn -corrected system temperatures Tsys,n,s\n\u2217\nTR,n . Our sources are all small, no more than a few arcmin in diameter. If a source lies within an\nextended region of emission, then our derived source flux includes the antenna temperature from\nthat extended region. Thus, our source fluxes should be systematically larger than those measured\ninterferometrically. This does not affect the scales of our derived opacity spectra because they are\nderived from ON\u2013OFF differences.\n\n2.6.\n2.6.1.\n\nLeast-squares fitting the spectra\nThe least-squares technique: theory\n\nConventionally, one observes off-source positions to obtain the \"expected profile\" Texp (\u03bd),\nwhich is the line profile one would observe at the source's position if the continuum source were\nturned off. One uses the expected profile for two purposes: one subtracts it from the on-source\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nspectrum, which difference provides the opacity spectrum; and one combines it with the opacity to\nobtain the spin temperatures.\nThis conventional technique is not perfect because the off-source emission spectra differ from\nthe expected profile. There are two reasons. First, the antenna response to the continuum source\nis not zero for the off positions, so the off-source emission spectra are contaminated by a small,\nunknown contribution from the opacity spectrum. Second, there is angular structure in emission\nspectra. We treat these problems using a least squares technique.\nWe assume that the angular structure in each spectral channel can be represented by a Taylor\nseries expansion; for our early data we carried it to first order and we obtained the derivatives from\na four-point off-source grid centered on the source (the Z4 pattern). Later we carried the expansion\nto second order. Obtaining second derivatives from measurements on the two-dimensional sky\nrequires measuring a minimum of nine independent positions. Normally one selects positions on a\nnine-point grid centered on the position of interest, and includes the central position as an equal\npartner in the calculation of the derivatives. However, in this case the central point is not an equal\npartner because it contains the continuum source. Therefore we need at least one additional point.\nMoreover, we want redundancy so that we can estimate the uncertainties in the derived quantities.\nIn practice, we made measurements on the 17-point grid shown in Figure 1; there is one on-source\npoint and 16 off-source points (the Z16 pattern).\nAs described above, for each pattern we corrected the on-source measurement for the gain errors\nGn . However, all the off-source measurements for pattern number n have a single independentlycalibrated gain Gn which differs from Gn . If there were no gain errors for the off-source measurements, i.e. if Gn = 1, then each measurement j within pattern n would provide the true system\n\u2217\ntemperature Tsys,n,j\n(\u03bd) at each frequency channel \u03bd in the profile, which satisfies the equation\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202Texp (\u03bd)\n\u2202Texp (\u03bd)\n\u2206\u03b1j +\n\u2206\u03b4j +\n\u2212\n= [Texp (\u03bd)] +\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03b4\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2202Texp (\u03bd)2\n\u2202Texp (\u03bd)2 (\u2206\u03b4j )2\n\u2202Texp (\u03bd)2 (\u2206\u03b1j )2\n\u2217\n+\n+ [e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) ]Tant,n,j\n.\n(\u2206\u03b1j ) (\u2206\u03b4j ) +\n\u22022\u03b1\n2\n\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b4\n\u22022\u03b4\n2\n\u2217\nTsys,n,j\n(\u03bd)\n\n\u2217\nTR,n\n\n\u0014\n\n(8)\n\nHere, as before, we have N patterns, each of which is denoted with subscript n, and within each\npattern we have J measurements, each of which is denoted by subscript j. Each pattern consists of\nmeasurements at J = 17 positions, one of which is directly on-source; even the off-source positions\n\u2217\nhave nonzero Tant,n,j\n, as discussed above. The appended symbols (\u03bd) indicate frequency-dependent\nquantities within the profile; unappended temperatures are continuum. Quantities to be derived\nfrom a least squares treatment are enclosed in square brackets. There are 7 such quantities for the\nfull second-order expansion and 4 for the first-order one.\nIn fact, however, we have off-source gain uncertainties, just as we had on-source gain uncertainties in \u00a72.4. To convert from the idealized starred quantities to the measured ones, we multiply\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- The 17-point measurement grid of the Z16 pattern. It consists of two crosses, one aligned\nwith ra/dec (squares) and one at 45\u25e6 to ra/dec (diamonds).

Rather, it means that we\nhave N additional quantities, the Gn , for a total of (7 + N ) unknowns for each spectral channel.\nWe cannot solve this on a channel-by-channel basis because Gn is identical for all channels and,\nmoreover, for a single channel the equations are degenerate. To remove the degeneracy we need to\nhave different system temperatures, and these are provided by different channels with their varying\n21-cm line emission and absorption spectral values.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nWe can solve the system of equations by considering all channels simultaneously in the fit to\nthe N patterns. If C is the number of channels in the profile, this means solving CN J equations.\nFor each channel there are 7 unknowns [\u03c4 (\u03bd) together with Texp (\u03bd) and its various derivatives] and\nfor the ensemble of patterns there are N unknown gains, so the total of unknowns is (7C + N ).\nThe number of equations exceeds the number of unknowns and the solution exists as long as there\nis no degeneracy.\nHowever, with current computers it is difficult (but hardly impossible) to solve these CN J\nequations using least squares because often C \u223c 1000 and typically N \u223c 100; the entire assembly\nconstitutes CN J \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 106 independent measurements with \u223c (7000 + N ) unknowns, so using\nmatrix techniques requires generating and manipulating a \u223c (1.5 \u00d7 106 ) \u00d7 7100 matrix, which\noccupies \u223c 40 Gb of memory.\nWe attack the problem by splitting it into two parts; this is motivated by the fact that typically\nall Gn = 1 to within a few percent. First, we assume all Gn = 1 and solve equation 8 for the\n\u2217\nm\n\u2217 . Solving\nspectral quantities, treating each channel individually, first setting Tant,n\n= Tsys,n\n\u2212 TR,n\nthese N J \u223c 1500 separate equations by least-squares provides the 7 unknowns for each channel;\nrepeating the process for each channel provides all of the \u223c 7000 unknowns. Next we use these\nderived quantities in a least-squares fit for the N Gn , using all frequency channels simultaneously:\nthis fit has, as before, \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 106 measurements, but only N \u223c 100 unknowns, and is tractable.\nThis provides the N gains; using these, we again perform the solution for the spectral quantities\nfor each channel individually. It is unnecessary to iterate further, because this procedure converges\nrapidly and a single iteration derives the gains to high accuracy.\nThere is one additional complication in the least-square fitting, which is that each of the N\npatterns, each of the J measurements within each pattern, and each frequency channel have a\ndifferent intrinsic noise. For each of the N J measurements the system temperature is different;\nin particular, the on-source measurements within a pattern have a significantly, sometimes much,\nhigher system temperature than the off-source measurements. Moreover, the system temperatures\ndepend on frequency; for example, at the peak optical depth of the 21-cm line, the on-source system\ntemperature is smaller than that off the line. Finally, some of our data were taken with the fivepoint observing grid and some with the 17-point grid; the individual measurements for these grids\nhave different integration times. The equation of condition for each measurement for a particular\nspectral channel received the weight Wn (\u03bd) equal to the reciprocal of the rms noise \u03c3(T ) calculated\nin the usual way2\nWn (\u03bd) =\n2\n\n1\n\u03c3(T (\u03bd))\n\nsee \u00a715.4 of Press et al (1992), which calls the set of equations of condition the \"design matrix\".\n\n(10a)\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nwhere\n\u03c3(T (\u03bd)) =\n\n0.77Tsys (\u03bd)\n\u221a\nt\u2206\u03bd\n\n(10b)\n\nwhere Tsys (\u03bd) is the system temperature in that channel, t the integration time, and \u2206\u03bd the\nfrequency separation between channels; we empirically determined the factor 0.77 as being what\nwas required to reproduce the observed \u03c3(T (\u03bd)).\n\n2.6.2.\n\nThe least-squares technique: illustration\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the fit technique and results for 3C454.3. We illustrate using this source for\ntwo reasons. First, it is strong, so that the off-source positions have an easily detectable continuum\nflux from the source. In addition, it has unusually large gain errors, both for on-source Gn and offsource Gn , for the following reason. It is a VLBI calibrator and was observed near Solar maximum\nin early March 1999, when it had the same right ascension of the Sun; this put it only about 23\u25e6\nfrom the Sun. It suffered severe interplanetary scintillation, which produced some variability in its\napparent intensity on the time scale of a few seconds, which was the interval during which our cal\nwas turned on and off; these variations produced significant errors in the measured cal deflection,\nwhich led to gain errors for the on-source spectra as high as \u223c 50% and for the off-source spectra\nas high as \u223c 10%.\nFigure 2 plots the measured antenna temperatures at frequency \u03bd1094 (spectral channel 1094)\nversus the measured continuum antenna temperatures. We chose this channel because it has the\nm\nm\n\u2217 ,\npeak optical depth. The vertical scale of the left panel is Tant,n,j\n(\u03bd1094) = Tsys,n,j\n(\u03bd1094) \u2212 TR,n\ni.e. the spectral antenna temperature not corrected for gain. The vertical scale of the right panel\n\u2217\nis the gain-corrected equivalent Tant,n,j\n(\u03bd1094), where we use Gn and Gn to correct the on-source\nand off-source measurements, respectively.\nThese plots are for the Z4 pattern with one on-source and four off-source measurements. The\non-source datapoints are those having Tant,n > 100 K. There is one on-source datapoint for each\npattern n; its gain is the on-source gain Gn . There are four off-source datapoints for each pattern\nn; their gains are all identical, equal to the off-source gain Gn .\nThere are four plotted lines in each of the two panels of Figure 2. Each line is a least-squares\nfit for the measurements of the on position and one of the four off positions. They have slightly\ndifferent y-intercepts but, as a constraint of the fits, identical slopes. The slope is e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd1094) . The\nfour y-intercepts are the observed antenna temperatures for the four off positions, averaged over\nall N patterns.\nIn the left panel the dispersion of on-source antenna temperatures is huge, which is a result\nof the anomalously high gain errors produced by the scintillation. The dispersion of the off-source\npoints is much less, but still larger than expected. These excessive dispersions are produced by\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nscintillation. The dispersions are much smaller for the gain-corrected data in the right panel.\nIn the right panel, the corrected on-source antenna temperatures disperse along the plotted\nline. This shows that the gain-corrected dispersion does not arise from statistical noise. Rather,\nit is real and reflects Arecibo's (az, za)-dependent point-source gain [K Jy\u22121 ]n . Similarly, the offsource points disperse along the line; this is produced by the small responses of the beam to the\nsource at the off-source positions, which differ from one pattern n to another as the telescope beam\nrotates on the sky.\n\nFig. 2.- Tant for frequency \u03bd1094 (spectral channel 1094) versus Tant for the continuum. On-source\ndatapoints for pattern n are those having Tant,n > 100 K; the others are off-source points, four for\neach pattern. The left panel shows the measured values without gain correction, the right panel\nwith gain correction. See \u00a72.6.2.\n\n2.7.\n\nEvaluation of instrumental effects\n\nOur ultimate goal is to derive only two of the spectral profile parameters in equations 8 and\n9, namely the expected profile Texp (\u03bd) and the opacity profile e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) . We need the other profile\nparameters involving angular derivatives only for the purpose of estimating uncertainties in the two\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\ndesired profiles.\nThe least squares process itself directly provides uncertainties in the M derived parameters;\nthe equation for the m'th parameter is, in schematic form,\n\nerrorm = Cmm\n\nPN \u22121\n\nresidualn2\nN (N \u2212 M )\n\nn=0\n\n(11)\n\nwhere Cmm is the m'th diagonal element of the covariance matrix and N is the number of independent patterns. There are three basic assumptions in this equation. Most important is that the\nmeasurements are independent. Also, that the residuals are randomly (normally) distributed about\nthe true value and that there is no covariance among the derived quantities.\nHowever, this equation cannot apply for our derived spectral parameters: specifically, while we\ncan divide by (N \u2212 M ) we should certainly not divide by the additional factor of N . The reason is\nthat we have a number N identical patterns, meaning N measurements of each OFF position and\nthe ON position. Suppose that there were no instrumental noise; then the residuals for all patterns\nwould be identical, because the residuals would produced be only by the higher angular derivatives\nthan we measure. In this case, dividing by the additional factor of N produces a meaningless and\nunrealistic reduction in errorm . In fact, each of the N patterns does have some instrumental noise.\nWe need a technique to average the instrumental noise but not to artifically decrease the derived\nerrorm .\nWe describe our technique for deriving the error in Texp (\u03bd) for the 17-point pattern; we use\na similar technique for the 5-point pattern. The 17-point pattern has 16 OFF measurements.\nFor a set of N patterns, we average each OFF measurement over the N patterns; this averages\nthe instrumental noise and provides a fairly noise-free measurement of the antenna temperature\nspectrum at each of the 16 independent OFF positions. Also, equation 8 provides a prediction of the\nsame spectrum at each OFF position once the fitting process has yielded spectra for the unknowns\nin that equation. For each channel independently, we calculate the 16 differences between the\nmeasured and predicted antenna temperatures. These 16 residuals represent 16 different estimates\nof the error of the fit in predicting the antenna temperature in that channel. We average the squares\nof these 16 residuals and take the square root, obtaining an rms spectrum \u2206T (\u03bd) in which the\nspectral values are statistically representative uncertainties of the predicted antenna temperatures\nat the OFF positions. \u2206T (\u03bd) should also characterize the uncertainties of the predicted antenna\ntemperatures at the ON position; thus \u2206Texp (\u03bd) = \u2206T (\u03bd).\nThe error in the expected profile is simply \u2206Texp (\u03bd). To derive the error in the optical depth\nprofile, we recall that if the source were turned off (making its flux S = 0 Jy) then the ON-source\nantenna temperature TON, 0Jy is the expected profile\nTON, 0Jy (\u03bd) = Texp (\u03bd)\n\n(12a)\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Illustrating the derived spectral parameters and their uncertainties as derived in \u00a72.7\nfor the source 3C225a, which has severe problems with derivatives. In the top panel, the solid\nline profile extending above zero is the expected profile Texp (\u03bd) and the solid line profile extending\nbelow zero is the (negative of) its uncertainty \u2206Texp (\u03bd). In the bottom panel, the solid line profile\nextending above zero is the opacity profile [1 \u2212 e\u03c4 (\u03bd) ] and the solid line profile extending below zero\nis the (negative of) its uncertainty \u2206e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) . Gaussian parameters for the WNM (top) and CNM\n(bottom) are given in square brackets. For a complete description of other features in these twopanel plots, see \u00a72.8 and 4.1. Plots for all sources are in the electronic edition of The Astrophysical\nJournal. Also, they can be retreived by ftp from vermi.berkeley.edu/pub/zobs/bigfig.ps .\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nand with the source turned on (S = Ssrc Jy) we have\nTON, Ssrc Jy (\u03bd) = Texp (\u03bd) + Tsrc e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd)\n\n(12b)\n\nwhere Tsrc = [K Jy\u22121 ]Ssrc is the continuum antenna temperature of the source. Combining these\nprovides\ne\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) =\n\nTON, Ssrc Jy (\u03bd) \u2212 Texp (\u03bd)\nTsrc\n\n(12c)\n\nTo calculate the uncertainty in the opacity profile \u2206e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) , we retain only the uncertainty in\nTexp (\u03bd); the fractional errors in TON, Ssrc Jy (\u03bd) and Tsrc are negligible because they are averages of\nN directly-measured quantities. This gives\n\u2206e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) =\n\n\u2206Texp (\u03bd)\nTsrc\n\n(12d)\n\nFigure 3 illustrates these results for 3C225a, for which the angular derivatives for VLSR . \u221215\nkm s\u22121 are particularly deleterious. The top panel shows the expected profile Texp (\u03bd) and its error\n\u2206Texp (\u03bd); the bottom panel, the opacity profile e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) and its error \u2206e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) . The relative error in\nthe expected profile \u2206Texp (\u03bd)/Texp (\u03bd) is small, which is typical for all sources.\nFor our sources the relative errors in the opacity profile are usually, but not always, small. For\nthe example of 3C225a the errors for the negative velocity peaks are comparable to the measured\nvalues. This is fortunate, as the measured values for e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) exceed unity-meaning \u03c4 < 0, which\nimplies an interstellar maser! We don't expect negative spin temperatures for the 21-cm line, and\nour error analysis shows that these measurements are meaningless. This source, 3C225a, is a serious\nexample of large angular derivatives in the 21-cm line emission. Some sources are equally serious,\nalthough none of these others happens to exhibit apparent maser emission as a result.\n\n2.8.\n\nMachine-readable data and the two-panel plots\n\nTable 1 presents the expected profile, the opacity profile, and the various derivatives of the\nemission profile for all sources.\nWe exhibit our results for each source in a plot with two panels. We present plots for all sources\nin the electronic edition of The Astrophysical Journal, of which Figure 3 is an example. For each\nsource, we choose the smallest possible velocity range for each plot because we are interested in the\nfine-scale velocity structure. Sometimes this requires us to cut off some emission and/or opacity\ncomponents that lie outside the displayed range; however, we do this only when the fits outside the\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\ndisplayed range are good. In no case do we restrict the velocity range when the fits do not agree\nwith the data, or if there is interesting profile structure, outside the range. For two sources that\nhave both wide- and narrow-velocity structure we present two velocity ranges.\nIn the top panel, the solid line profile extending above zero is the expected profile Texp (\u03bd).\nThe dashed curves show the fitted emission from each individual WNM component, including\nabsorption by the CNM (described in \u00a73), and the heavy-dashed curve shows the totality of WNM\nfitted Gaussians TB,W N M (equation 20). The solid line near mid-profile-height is the residuals\nof the data from the fit. The dotted curves show the intrinsic emission from each individual\nCNM component, not including absorption from the CNM components that lie in front, and the\nheavy dots the predicted emission of all CNM components including absorption from the CNM\ncomponents that lie in front (TB,CN M in equation 19). The long-dashed curve is the predicted\nexpected profile (TB,W N M + TB,CN M ). The solid line profile extending below zero is the (negative\nof the) uncertainties \u2206Texp (\u03bd) described in \u00a72.7.\nIn the bottom panel, the solid line profile extending above zero is the opacity profile [1 \u2212 e\u03c4 (\u03bd) ].\nThe dotted curves show each individual CNM opacity Gaussian and the heavy dots show the sum\nof all the CNM Gaussians [1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) ], with \u03c4 (\u03bd) from equation 18. The solid line near mid-profileheight is the residuals of the data from the fit. The dashed curve near mid-profile height shows the\nsum of the lower limits of WNM opacity (\u00a73.6), separately for each WNM component. The solid\nline profile extending below zero is the (negative of the) uncertainties in the opacity profile \u2206e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd)\n(equation 21c).\nAnnotations in the top and bottom panels list properties of the WNM and CNM Gaussian\ncomponents, respectively, listed in order of increasing velocity. In the upper panel, TB is the fitted\nintrinsic, unabsorbed brightness temperature of each WNM component (T0,k in equation 20) and\nTKMAX is the upper limit kinetic temperature from the linewidth (\u00a74.1). TSMIN is the lower\nlimit on WNM spin temperature (\u00a73.6).\nIn the lower panel, TAU is the peak optical depth of each CNM component \u03c40,n in equation 18,\nTSPIN is the fitted value for spin temperature Ts,n in equation 19, and \u2206TSPIN is the uncertainty\nin Ts,n (equation 21c).\nAlso, each panel has a parameter X, which is the factor by which both the residuals and\nprofile errors are magnified for clarity. If the bottom panel has no properties listed, then no CNM\ncomponents were fit.\n\n2.9.\n\nComparison of our results with previous ones\n\nWe compare our results with two of the most sensitive previous HI line absorption surveys,\nDickey, Salpeter, & Terzian (1978; DST) and Payne, Salpeter, & Terzian (1982; PST). The comparisons cannot be exact because we don't have the original data. We have 10 sources in common\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nwith PST; all show reasonable agreement. For a few we see weak opacity tails where PST might\nnot and for a few the scales of the measured quantity, which is (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) ), differ by up to \u223c 15%.\nWe have 15 sources in common with DST, of which 13 have detectable absorption lines. Of\nthese 13, most show reasonable agreement, again with possible differences in profile wings and scale.\nThree agree badly: 3C237, 3C310, and 3C348. The disagreements are in the line shape: the DST\nprofiles are either broader or have more components than ours. Profiles with more components\nappear like \"ghosts\", with a pattern of less-intense components shifted with respect to the same\npattern of more intense ones. PST observed 3C237, which result agrees with ours. Dickey (personal\ncommunication) confirms our suspicion that the local oscillator during some of his observations\nwas either unstable or improperly set for Doppler correction because of the transient nature of the\nArecibo software at the time. Greisen and Liszt (1986) observed 3C348 interferometrically and\nobtained an opacity spectrum that agrees with ours; they erroneously ascribed their disagreement\nwith DST to difficulties with the single-dish observing and data-reduction process.\n\n3.\n\nDERIVING CNM SPIN TEMPERATURES AND WNM BRIGHTNESS\nTEMPERATURES: RADIATION TRANSFER IN THE 21-cm LINE\n3.1.\n\nA single temperature HI\n\nMuch HI emission/absorption work has assumed a single temperature HI component, for which\nthe equation of transfer is\nTexp (\u03bd) = Ts (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) )\n\n(13)\n\nBoth the expected profile Texp (\u03bd) and the opacity profile \u03c4 (\u03bd) are measured quantities, so one\nobtains the spin temperature directly from this equation.\nHowever, the assumption of a single temperature is clearly inadequate because emission profiles\nare always wider than opacity profiles. This means that some HI is so warm that it produces\nemission, contributing to Texp (\u03bd) but having negligible opacity; this produces spin temperatures Ts\nthat lie between the warm and cold values.\n\n3.2.\n\nA two-component HI\n\nThis observational situation leads to the concept of a two-component medium, with the Cold\nNeutral Medium (CNM) providing the opacity and also brightness temperature and the Warm\nNeutral Medium (WNM) providing only brightness temperature. Separating the CNM and WNM\ncontributions to Texp (\u03bd) then becomes the major difficulty.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nThe equation of transfer for this case is discussed recently by Mebold et al (1997) and Dickey\net al (2000). The expected profile consists of the WNM and the CNM components:\nTexp (\u03bd) = TB,W N M (\u03bd) + TB,CN M (\u03bd)\n\n(14)\n\nHere a fraction F of the WNM lies in front of of the CNM so that a fraction (1 \u2212 F) of the WNM\nemission is absorbed by the CNM gas:\nTB,W N M (\u03bd) = TE,W N M (\u03bd)[F + (1 \u2212 F)e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) ]\n\n(15)\n\nwhere TE,W N M (\u03bd) is the intrinsic, unabsorbed emission from the WNM gas and \u03c4 (\u03bd) is the CNM\nopacity. The emission from the CNM is just the usual\nTB,CN M (\u03bd) = Ts (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) )\n\n(16)\n\nThese authors discuss and illustrate how to separate the components by plotting the two\nobservables Texp (\u03bd) and [1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) ] against each other:\nTexp (\u03bd) = TE,W N M (\u03bd) + [Ts \u2212 TE,W N M (\u03bd)(1 \u2212 F)][1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) ]\n\n(17)\n\nThe y-intercept is TE,W N M (\u03bd) and the slope is [Ts \u2212TE,W N M (1\u2212F]). Because F lies between 0 and\n1, the slope provides limits on Ts . Some inaccuracy occurs because in the region where the slope\nis defined the quantities change with \u03bd, but nevertheless the method seems to produce reasonable\nresults. We call this the \"slope method\".\nPrevious single-dish authors, in contrast, implicitly assume that clouds are not isothermal.\nThey derive the spin temperature from equation 13 at the opacity profile peak, where the derived\ntemperature is coldest; this spin temperature lies between between the lowest and highest temperatures along the line of sight through the cloud. Moreover, temperatures derived off of the opacity\nprofile peak are warmer. Thus each point on their histograms does not represent a true mean cloud\ntemperature; rather, it represents the lowest derived temperature, which itself is a weighted mean\ntemperature for which the weights are unknown.\n\n3.3.\n\nGaussian components and radiative transfer\n\nOur emission and opacity profiles clearly consist of multiple components, which often overlap\nand have different spin temperatures. This requires generalizing the equations in \u00a73.2, which we\naccomplish by assuming the components can be represented as Gaussians.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nFor each CNM opacity spectrum, we represent its components' optical depths by a set of N\nGaussians. Thus we least-squares fit the observed opacity spectrum e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) , where\n\u03c4 (\u03bd) = \u03a30N \u22121 \u03c40,n e\u2212[(\u03bd\u2212\u03bd0,n )/\u03b4\u03bdn ]\n\n2\n\n(18)\n\nin which (\u03bd0,n , \u03b4\u03bdn ) are (central frequency, 1e width) of component n. We assume that each component is an independent physical entity and is isothermal with spin temperature Ts,n . This fit yields\nvalues for all \u03c40,n , \u03bd0,n , and \u03b4\u03bd0,n .\nHaving fit the opacity profile to equation 18, we next fit the expected emission profile Texp (\u03bd)\nto the sum of the emission from the CNM and WNM. For the CNM, the brightness temperature\nof the assembly of CNM components is\nM \u22121\n\nTB,CN M (\u03bd) = \u03a30N \u22121 Ts,n (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4n (\u03bd) )e\u2212\u03a30\n\n\u03c4m (\u03bd)\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the subscript m with its associated optical depth profile \u03c4m (\u03bd) represents each of the M\nCNM clouds that lie in front of cloud n. This fit yields values for Ts,n . For multiple absorption\ncomponents, as part of the least-squares fit process we experiment with all possible orders along\nthe line of sight and choose the one that yields the smallest residuals.\nFor the WNM, we assume that the intrinsic, unabsorbed emission profile is represented by a\nset of K Gaussians. We also include the absorption of each WNM component by the CNM by\nassuming that a fraction Fk lies in front of all the CNM and is unabsorbed, with the rest all lying\nbehind; thus\n2\n\nTB,W N M = \u03a3K\u22121\n[Fk + (1 \u2212 Fk )e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) ]T0,k e\u2212[(\u03bd\u2212\u03bd0,k )/\u03b4\u03bdk ] ,\n0\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the subscript k represents each WNM component. This fit yields values for T0,k , \u03bd0,k , and\n\u03b4\u03bdk . We also experiment with determining Fk from the fit as discussed in \u00a73.4. Note that T0,k is\na brightness temperature, not a kinetic temperature; for component k, the intrinsic unabsorbed\n2\nemission profile is TB,W N M,k = T0,k e[(\u03bd\u2212\u03bd0,k /\u03b4\u03bdk ] . In fitting Texp (\u03bd) = TB,CN M (\u03bd) + TB,W N M (\u03bd),\nwe usually find that Fk is indeterminate and we can only distinguish between the two extremes\nFk = (0, 1). The differences between the Fk = 0 and 1 profile variances (\u03c3 2 of the data points from\nthe fit) are usually not statistically significant but nevertheless lead to differences in the derived\nCNM temperatures. These differences reflect the uncertainties in Ts,n more than the conventional\nerrors derived from least squares fits.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n3.4.\n\nPermuting CNM components and trying different F for WNM components\n\nFor the CNM components, TB,CN M (\u03bd) depends on the order of the components along the line of\nsight. The ordering is a discrete quantity and cannot be solved for using the standard least-squares\ntechnique. Rather, we must try solutions for different orderings and compare the variances \u03c3 2 from\nthe residuals of the fits. For N CNM components there are N ! possible orderings. However, some\nof these are extraneous because changing the order only matters for clouds whose profiles overlap in\nvelocity. Thus, we define the quantity Nx such that there are Nx ! possible orderings of overlapping\nCNM components. Obviously, Nx \u2264 N , and if N > 0, then Nx \u2265 1; Nx cannot be zero because a\ncomponent overlaps with itself. In our data set, the smallest value of Nx ranges from 1 to 5 (with\n120 possible orderings). The statistics are: (Nx , number of sources) = (1, 25), (2, 19), (3, 12), (4,\n2), (5, 6); 15 sources have no detectable CNM components.\nFor the WNM components, TB,W N M depends on the values of Fk . Fk can, in principle, be\ndetermined by least squares. However, only rarely are the the variances sufficiently sensitive to Fk\nfor least squares to work. Even though the variances are insensitive, the derived parameters (such\nas the associated CNM spin temperatures and the CNM and WNM HI column densities) depend\non the Fk .\nTherefore, we explore the range of each WNM's Fk by calculating the results for three values,\nFk = (0, 0.5, 1). There are K WNM components and we consider all possible combinations, which\nis 3K . However, some of these are extraneous because the value of a WNM component's Fk only\nmatters if the component's profile overlaps an absorbing CNM component. Thus, we define the\nquantity Kx , which is the number of such WNM Gaussian components. The statistics are: (Kx ,\nnumber of sources) = (1, 28), (2, 33), (3, 2), (4, 1); 15 sources have no detectable CNM components,\nso KX = 0.\nFor any given source, the total number of trial least square fits is [Nx ! 3Kx ]. The two sources\nwith the largest total number are 3C138 and 3C409, both with Nx = 5 and Kx = 2 and 1080 total\ntrials. Most sources have many fewer trials.\nF = 0 means that the WNM lies behind the CNM so that the WNM'S emission is absorbed.\nThis means that the CNM must make up for the missing WNM emission, so the least-square-fitted\nspin temperatures are always higher for F = 0 than for F = 1. Also, the fitted WNM brightness\ntends to be larger for F = 0 than for F = 1, but this is a smaller effect. The other WNM\nparameters, central velocity and width, are only marginally sensitive to Fk . Of course, the WNM\nparameters are completely insensitive to the CNM component ordering, because we assume that\nFk is the same for all CNM components.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n3.5.\n\nCalculating the physical parameters\n\nFor most sources, the variances don't change very much among the various trials. Typically\nthese changes are less than 20%, and this is not enough to distinguish one particular trial as being\nsignificantly better than others. (Occasionally the changes are much bigger; we discuss these two\nsources below.) However, the derived physical parameters such as spin temperature and HI column\ndensity do change significantly among the trials. We derive a value and error for each physical\nparameter by taking a weighted average over all trials. The weight of each trial is the reciprocal of\nthe variance \u03c3 2 computed from the residuals to the fit to Texp (\u03bd).\nFor example, consider the spin temperature of a particular CNM component for a source having\nF trial least-square fits; normally F = [Nx ! 3Kx ], but for some sources some fits don't converge\nand F is smaller. Let Ts,f be the spin temperature derived for fit f and wf = (1/\u03c3f2 ) be the trial\n2\nfit's weight. Then we derive the mean spin temperature hTs i and its variance \u03c3hT\nby the usual\nsi\nweighted average\n\nhTs i =\n2\n\u03c3hT\nsi\n\n=\n\n\" PF \u22121\nf =0\n\nPF \u22121\n\nf =0 wf Ts,f\nPF \u22121\nf =0 wf\n\nwf [(Ts,f \u2212 hTs i)2 + \u03c3(Ts,f )2 ]\nPF \u22121\nf =0 wf\n\n(21a)\n#\u0014\n\nF\nF \u22121\n\n\u0015\n\n(21b)\n\nHere \u03c3(Ts,f )2 is the variance of Ts,f in the least squares fit number f ; it accounts for the intrinsic\nuncertainty in that particular fitted value for Ts,f .\n2 /F ]1/2 . However,\nNormally one would then define the uncertainty in hTs i as \u2206hTs i = [\u03c3hT\nsi\nthis is not appropriate for our case. This usual definition makes two assumptions: one, that the\nresiduals from the average, i.e. [Ts,f \u2212hTs i], are distributed randomly about the mean; and two, that\nthe mean is the same for all data. Neither assumption is valid here. The mean varies systematically\nwith Fk and tends to adopt three distinctly different values, corresponding to the three trials of\nFk , with small fluctuations about those values. A better representation of the uncertainty \u2206hTs i\nis the spread among the three values of Ts,f . A good approximation to this is simply\n\n\u2206hTs i = \u03c3hTs i\n\n(21c)\n\nThis description applies to all physical parameters including HI column densities, except that we\ndo not include the term \u03c3(Nf (HI))2 in equation 21b.\nFinally, we consider the most likely value hFk i. Again, each of the three trial values of Fk has\nNx ! least square fits, each with variance \u03c3f2 . We again take a weighted average, as above in equation\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n21. However, in this case the residuals are more nearly randomly distributed about a single mean.\nAccordingly, we define the uncertainty \u2206hFk i as\nh\ni1/2\n2\n\u2206hFk i = (\u03c3hF\n/N\n!\nx\ni\n\n(22)\n\nk\n\nThis equation deserves a small elaboration. Consider the case where there is no favored Fk ,\ni.e. where the the variances for all three choices Fk = (0, 0.5, 1) are equal. Then we derive hFk i = 0.5,\n\u2206hFk i = 0.29. This is the maximum \u2206hFk i; in practice the variances don't change much with Fk\nso that all sources have \u2206hFk i almost this large and, concomitantly, hFk i \u223c 0.5.\n3.6.\n\nLimits on Opacities and Spin Temperatures for WNM Components\n\nIn addition to parameters estimated directly from the least squares fits, we can also place limits\non the peak opacity and spin temperature of each WNM component k. First, we can estimate an\nupper limit to the peak opacity \u03c40,k . We do so by considering both the intrinsic uncertainty in\nthe opacity profile \u2206e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) (equation 12d; downward-going solid line in the bottom panel of the\ntwo-panel plots) and the residuals from the fit of the CNM components to the opacity profile (solid\nline near mid-profile height in the bottom panel of the two-panel plots). These estimates are upper\nlimits in the sense that higher values of \u03c40,k would produce WNM features in the opacity profiles\nthat are greater than the errors in our measurements. In Table 2, column 2 we list these upper\nlimits on \u03c40,k for WNM components. (See \u00a74 for a description of this table.) This upper limit,\nbeing visually estimated, is very uncertain; its error is not quoted, but realistically the error is\nlarge, something like half its value.\nT\n\n0,k\nfor a WNM\nThe above upper limit on \u03c40,k imply a lower limit on Ts,k , because Ts,k = \u03c40,k\ncomponent. We list these lower limits for the WNM components in Table 2, column 5 and as\nTSMIN in the upper panels of the two-panel plots such as Figure 3.\n\nFinally, we can estimate upper limits on on the kinetic temperatures of Gaussian components\nfrom the fitted line widths of WNM (and CNM) components. We define this limit as Tkmax =\n21.86\u2206V 2 . This parameter is listed in Table 2, column 6. For WNM components, Tkmax also\nimplies a lower limit on \u03c40,k .\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nGAUSSIAN COMPONENTS AND OUR DATA\n\nGaussian parameters in tabular form and graphical form\n\nWe present the numerical results of our fits in Table 2. The opacity and expected profiles,\ntogether with other desiderata are described in \u00a72.8.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n1. Column 1: TB is the intrinsic peak brightness temperature of the component. For WNM\ncomponents it is equal to the unabsorbed central height of the emission Gaussian T0,k (see\nequation 20) and its error is derived as discussed in \u00a73.5. For CNM components, TB is equal\nto the spin temperature Ts,n times (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c40,n ) (see equations 18 and 19) and its error is not\nquoted.\n2. Column 2: \u03c4 is the central opacity of the component. For CNM components, it is \u03c40,n from\nequation 18, derived directly from the least squares fit to the opacity profile. For WNM\ncomponents it is the upper limit to peak opacity \u03c40,k , estimated by eye (\u00a73.6), and has a very\nlarge error.\n3. Column 3: VLSR is the central VLSR in km s\u22121 .\n4. Column 4: \u2206V is the Gaussian FWHM km s\u22121 .\n5. Column 5: Ts is the spin temperature. For CNM components it is derived from the fit to\nthe expected profile; its error is derived as discussed in \u00a73.5. For a few CNM components,\nTs had to be forcibly set to zero to attain convergence of the fit to the expected profile. For\nWNM components Ts is a lower limit (\u00a73.6), and has a very large error; this is TSMIN in the\ntwo-panel plots.\n6. Column 6: Tkmax is the kinetic temperature of a component if there were no nonthermal\nbroadening; Tkmax = 21.86\u2206V 2 .\n7. Column 7: N (HI)20 is the HI column density in units of 1020 cm\u22122 . For the few CNM\ncomponents with Ts = 0, we assign N (HI) = 0.\n8. Column 8: For WNM components. F is the weighted average of F, calculated as described\nin \u00a73.5. For CNM components, O is equal to the order of the component along the line of\nsight, beginning with 0; increasing numbers mean increasing distance along the line of sight.\nThis order is the one for which the variance from the fit to the emission spectrum is smallest.\nFor CNM components, no error is given.\n9. Column 9: l/b/SOURCE are the Galactic longitude, latitude, and source name.\n\n4.2.\n\nThe process of fitting Gaussians\n\nFirst, we remark that the astronomically popular activity of fitting Gaussians to spectral\nprofiles is based on the assumption that velocity profiles are, indeed, characterized by Gaussians.\nThis is necessarily true when the damping wings are insignificant, as for the 21-cm line, and when\nthere are no nonthermal motions. However, most of our Gaussian components have linewidths\nTkmax > Ts , so that the line shape is determined by nonthermal motions. Unless the nonthermal\nmotions consist of a large number of turbulent elements, so that the central limit theorem applies,\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nthere is no known reason why a component's shape need be Gaussian. Nevertheless, both the\nopacity and expected profile of most sources are easily decomposed into Gaussians, so whether or\nnot this model is physically correct it works empirically and is convenient-and besides, how else\nwould one proceed?\nGaussian functions are not orthogonal, so our Gaussian fits are not unique. Rather, they reflect\nour subjective judgment in selecting the number of Gaussian components and other biases. Here\nwe describe our approach to this subjective procedure, a procedure based on the equations of \u00a73.3.\nFor each source we begin by fitting Gaussians to the opacity spectrum (equation 18; we call\nthese the \"CNM Gaussian components\". Our approach is to use the minimum number of components required to make the residuals of the fit comparable to or smaller than the errors derived as\ndiscussed in \u00a72.7. After fitting the opacity components, we fit the expected profile by simultaneously (1) fitting the intensities of the opacity components (whose centers and widths are fixed) and\n(2) adding one or more \"WNM Gaussian components\", which contribute to the expected profile\nbut not to the opacity profile. This fit to the expected profile is a fit to the sum of equations 19\nand 20.\nFor the WNM we again use the minimum number of WNM components. However, in this\ncase the criterion involves reducing the residuals of the fit to a \"reasonable\" level instead of to the\nmuch smaller level of the derived errors. The reason is that the WNM components are derived from\nthe observed expected profile, and this is subject to an unaccounted-for source of error, namely\nthe contribution of HI emission from directions outside the main telescope beam. In fact, almost\nhalf of the response of the Arecibo telescope to an extended source, such as the 21-cm line, comes\nfrom outside the main beam (Heiles et al 2001a). These directions are likely to contain velocity\ncomponents that are unrelated to those within the main beam, or have Gaussian parameters that\nare modified by angular derivatives.\nConsequently, when fitting the expected profile we use our subjective judgment in deciding\nhow many WNM components to fit. Almost always this number is small, consisting of one or two\nfairly narrow WNM components often sitting on top of a much weaker, broader one. Below we\npresent and discuss a number examples to illustrate our approach and our subjective definition of\nwhat is \"reasonable\".\nDuring the fitting process we were concerned about \"stray radiation\", which is radiation entering the telescope from distant sidelobes. This can produce unreal features in observed emission\nspectra. These are usually broad and could cause us to fit weak, broad WNM Gaussians that are\nunrelated to the gas in direction observed. For each source we compared the tails of our expected\nprofiles Texp (\u03bd) with the nearest profile of the Leiden-Dwingeloo survey (Hartmann and Burton\n1997). We were gratified-and somewhat surprised in view of Arecibo's substantial aperture blockage (Heiles et al 2001a)-to find that the differences between the intensities in the profile wings for\nthe two datasets are completely negligible. This implies that Arecibo's significant sidelobes all lie\nclose to the direction of the main beam. Thus, our HI column densities, even for the weak, broad\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nWNM components, are quite reliable.\n\n4.3.\n\nOptical lines versus the 21-cm line\n\nFig. 4.- Histogram of the velocity separations between adjacent CNM Gaussians. The lower panel\nis an expanded version.\nOur results should be comparable to the results from optical absorption lines of minority\nionization species such as KI because both sample the CNM. The 21-cm line opacity \u221d N (HI)Tk\u22121 .\nThe KI opacity is approximately \u221d N (KI); under ionization equilibrium, N (KI) \u221d N (HI)P T \u22121.7 ,\nwhere P is the CNM pressure, which is typically (P/k) = 2250 cm\u22123 K (Jenkins & Tripp 2001).\nThus optical absorption lines are biased towards low temperatures even more than the 21-cm line\nis.\nOptical interstellar absorption lines sample heavy elements, which have smaller thermal motions than HI, so they might reveal multiple narrow components where we might resolve only one.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nIf we take the results at face value, then this is indeed occurring. Figure 4 exhibits the histogram of\nvelocity separations between adjacent CNM Gaussian components. Welty and Hobbs (2001; WH)\npresent the same histogram for KI optical absorption line components in their Figure 16. Their\nhistogram has a pronounced peak centered at about 1.8 km s\u22121 , falling to zero below 0.7 km s\u22121\nand becoming small above 3 km s\u22121 . In contrast, ours is roughly flat from 0 to 5 km s\u22121 . They\ndiscuss their histogram in terms of a continuous distribution of closely-spaced components, and the\ndifference between our histogram and theirs could be a result of blending.\nHowever, we have lingering doubts about the reality of some of their closely-spaced components.\nIn some cases they need several components to reduce the residuals to their noise level; in other cases\nthey do not. To us, their sample of closely-spaced components seems inconsistently nonuniform.\nLooking at their Table 1, many stars have closely-spaced components and many do not (defined\nas < 1.9 km s\u22121 for this discussion). For example, \u03c9 1 Sco at (l, b) = (352.8\u25e6 , 22.8\u25e6 ) has 4 while the\nfairly nearby 1Sco at (346.1\u25e6 , 21.8\u25e6 ) has none; the two stars have comparable visual line profiles\nand extinctions E(B \u2212 V ) = (0.22, 0.19) mag, respectively. Are conditions really that different\ntowards the two stars, or is the presence of multiple closely-spaced components a vagary of small\ndepartures from idealized Gaussian line shapes and subjective judgment?\nWe asked this question above about our own Gaussians in \u00a74.2 and the question applies equally\nto the optical data. The KI line profiles are always dominated by nonthermal motions, because\neven the multiple closely-spaced components have nonthermal line widths. WH prefer to decompose\nthe line shapes by inserting multiple Gaussians subcomponents (actually, Voigt subcomponents)\nuntil the residuals are equal to the noise. This is a valid mathematical description of the profile,\nalthough it is not unique-but is it a valid physical description? We repeat, there is no physical\nreason to assume that turbulent broadened profiles are, in fact, Gaussian, unless the number of\nsubcomponents is so large that the central limit theorem applies.\nIn our opinion, the use of many subcomponents to represent a profile peak might, but does\nnot necessarily, describe the physical world.\n\n4.4.\n\nErrors incurred from fitting too many/too few Gaussians\n\nThe nonuniqueness of Gaussian fitting means that we might sometimes fit opacity profiles with\ntoo many or too few Gaussians. For example, perhaps the multiple closely-spaced components of\nWH are physically real. Here we discuss how this affects our derived spin temperature Ts .\n\n4.4.1.\n\nThe low-\u03c4 (\u03bd) case\n\nWe assume \u03c4 = (1 \u2212 e\u03c4 ) , which is valid for \u03c4 (\u03bd) . 1. Whether we fit N overlapping Gaussians,\nor fit only one when N are required in the physical world, we always require agreement with the\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\ndata, i.e.\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u03c4 (\u03bd)n = \u03c4 (\u03bd)\n\n(23a)\n\nTs,n \u03c4 (\u03bd)n = Texp (\u03bd)\n\n(23b)\n\n0\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n0\n\nwhere n represents each Gaussian and the quantities on the right are the observed ones. The\neasiest way to satisfy this combined requirement on both sums is for Ts,n to be the same for all\ncomponents, and this makes Ts independent of N . If Ts,n changes with n, then the values should\ncluster around the n-independent one. Therefore, derived spin temperatures for all the Gaussian\ncomponents are not sensitive to the number of fitted Gaussians N .\nThe same cannot be said of the velocity widths and integrated areas of the Gaussians. If we fit\nGaussian-shaped opacity and expected profiles with multiple blended Gaussians, then the widths\n(Tkmax ) and areas (N (HI)) necessarily decrease with N .\n\n4.4.2.\n\nThe high-\u03c4 (\u03bd) case\n\nThe high-\u03c4 (\u03bd) case is harder to treat because the emission is nonlinearly related to \u03c4 . Here we\nconsider a simple model in which N clouds of identical \u03c4 (\u03bd) and Ts lie behind each other. In this\ncase, equation 23a remains valid but equation 23b becomes a simpler version of equation 19 with\nall Ts,n = Ts and all \u03c4 (\u03bd)n = \u03c4 , namely\nM \u22121\n\nTexp (\u03bd) = Ts \u03a30N \u22121 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) )e\u2212\u03a30\n\n\u03c4 (\u03bd)\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\nOne can manipulate this equation to show that Ts is independent of N , as it is for the low-opacity\ncase. Thus again, for this illustrative model the derived spin temperature is unaffected by the\nnumber of components that represent the profile.\n\n4.5.\n\nFitting the opacity profiles: CNM Gaussian components\n4.5.1.\n\nSources for which the CNM fits are fairly unambiguous\n\nFor many sources either a single Gaussian or multiple ones that don't overlap are sufficient\n(i.e., Nx = 1); examples are 3C315 and 3C207, shown in Figures 17 and 18 below.

Examples are 3C120 and P0531+19, shown in\nFigures 16 and 19 (these are presented below because their main focus is in later discussion).\nFor 3C120 we use three Gaussians and achieve residuals that are considerably smaller than the\nerrors; this exceeds the requirement of a good fit. However, two Gaussians produce residuals that\nvastly exceed the errors, so three Gaussians is the correct choice. We have not been able to fit\nthree Gaussians with other parameters than those given, so the validity of this fit seems secure.\nP0531+19 has two distinctly separated narrow peaks connected by a nonzero broad region and is\nfit well by two narrow and one broad Gaussians. Three Gaussians are certainly required and, again,\nno other combination of Gaussians works, so this seems the correct solution.\n\n4.5.2.\n\nSources for which the CNM fits are more ambiguous or difficult\n\n3C123 (Figure 5) is a good example of two difficulties. One is overlapping opacity components,\nwhich make the uniqueness of a fit less certain; in the case of 3C123, the overlapping components\nare indistinguishable, making a true fit impossible. 3C123 is a very strong source, so its opacity\nspectrum has small errors and imperfections of the fit reveal small inadequacies. The main opacity\npeak has (\u03c40 = 1.60 \u00b1 0.03) and, when fit with a single or even a \"reasonable number\" of Gaussians,\nhas residuals that vastly exceed the errors. We believe that the main absorption peak consists of\nseveral overlapping narrow components, which are degenerate in the fitting process. 3C123 lies\nnear a molecular cloud in the Taurus/Perseus region and even exhibits OH absorption, which is\nrare for our sources. 3C123 has at least three narrow OH absorption components (\u2206V = 0.5 to 1.4\nkm s\u22121 ) in the velocity range 2 to 7 km s\u22121 (Troland & Heiles, in preparation; Crutcher, Troland,\n& Heiles 1981). Each of these is likely to have associated HI, producing overlapping narrow HI\ncomponents.\nAn additional problem with 3C123 is its 20.0 km s\u22121 CNM component: the least squares fit to\nthe expected profile would not converge unless its spin temperature was forced to zero. Its opacity\n\u03c40 = 0.007 \u00b1 0.002, which is very small, and we suspect that this component occupies a small\nsolid angle, absorbing a small fraction of 3C123 continuum and contributing insufficient 21-cm line\nbrightness to be detected. The same situation occurs for two opacity components in 3C273.\nSources near the Galactic plane (defined here as |b| < 10\u25e6 ) have complicated absorption spectra and cannot always be fit in a reasonable way; 3C167 (Figure 6) is an example, others being\n3C141.0, T0526+24, T0556+19, T0629+10). On the other hand, some low-|b| sources are well-fit:\nfor example, 3C409 (Figure 7) is exceedingly well-fit, seemingly unambiguously, by 6 Gaussians;\nothers (not quite so well fit) include 3C154, 4C13.67, 4C22.12, P0531+19, 3C138. Intermediate\ncases are 3C131, 3C133, 3C410.\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\n4.6.\n\nFitting the expected profiles: WNM Gaussian components\n\nWe thoroughly discuss two example cases, 3C120 and 3C138, in detail in \u00a74.7. Here we present\nsome examples and describe them only briefly.\n\n4.6.1.\n\nSources for which WNM fits are fairly unambiguous\n\nSometimes only a single WNM component is required (e.g. P0531+19, Figure 19). More often\ntwo are required, one a broad, weak one to fit the wings of the line and the other a much more\nintense and narrow component to fill in the emission line, e.g. 3C207 and 3C315 (Figures 18,\n17). Sometimes additional nonoverlapping WNM components at different velocities are required,\ne.g. 3C120 (Figure 16). All these cases are straightforward and unambiguous. More complicated\nWNM cases include, of course, sources near the Galactic plane, and also others. Many complicated\ncases are nevertheless well-fit, including those listed above as being unambiguously fit with CNM\nGaussians.\n\n4.6.2.\n\nSources for which the WNM fits are more ambiguous or difficult\n\nSome sources away from the plane are remarkably complicated: 4C13.65 (Figure 8) has a broad\nWNM component with several narrower ones within; it is complicated but the Gaussian process\nseems fairly secure. 3C208.1 (Figure 9) has no reliable CNM components because of the relatively\nlarge \u2206e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) , but it has several WNM components; its nearby brother, 3C208.0, is similar.\n3C225a (Figure 3) and 3C225b (Figure 10) have truly complicated expected profiles, each of\nwhich extends over a wide velocity range and has several peaks connected by a broad Gaussian which\nis only a surrogate for reality. These sources are separated by only 6.3 arcmin so that one expects\nthem to be similar, and they are. However, their Gaussian representations differ significantly, partly\nbecause 3C225b has CNM components at velocities where 3C225a has WNM ones; this is, in turn,\na consequence of the fact that 3C225a has large errors in its opacity spectrum (Figure 3). Also,\nthe fitting process yields quite different estimates for the WNM components in the velocity range\n\u201315 to 10 km s\u22121 , largely because the contribution to the expected profiles of the broad weak CNM\ncomponent in this range is poorly determined, particularly for 3C225a. Inconsistencies between\nthe fits to this pair of sources illustrate the uncertainties introduced by large angular derivatives.\nFortunately, our observing and analysis techniques reveal these derivatives and the errors they\nintroduce. Because the optical depth error profile for 3C225b is about a factor of two smaller than\nthat for 3C225a, the WNM and CNM components to 3C225b should be more reliable.\nHeiles (2001b) presented a short preliminary report of this work which featured 3C18 (Figure\n11) as an example of a straightforward fit. Ironically, further reflection reveals that it is not so\nstraightforward, despite the fact that its profiles look so simple; in fact, 3C18 is probably the most\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\ndifficult case in our entire source list with regard to the ambiguity in assigning CNM and WNM\ncomponents. To illustrate this ambiguity for such a difficult case we discuss the alternative fit in\nthe following paragraph.\nIn the current fit for 3C18 we have replaced the earlier narrow WNM component, which had\nTkmax = 2200 K, with a CNM component that is 30% wider with Tkmax = 3640 K and Ts = 586\u00b111\nK. With the earlier fit, the residual of the opacity profile fit (i.e., the difference between the observed\nand fitted opacity profiles) had the same shape as the original narrow WNM component and was\nsomewhat larger in magnitude than the \u2206\u03c4 (\u03bd) profile. Accordingly, we could assign the residual\nto a new CNM component. At the same time, we eliminated a doubtful narrow CNM component\nin the original fit. The original and new fits are of comparable quality. This illustrate the effects\nof subjective judgment on measured spectra whose fitted residuals lie close to the intrinsic errors.\nWe emphasize that we do not necessarily regard the current fit as better than the earlier one;\nrather, we present this difficult case as an illustration. Accordingly, the spin temperature of this\nCNM component should be regarded with suspicion. However, if its spin temperature is close to\nthe derived value of 267 \u00b1 5 K, then this source is very unusual in having insignificant WNM. Our\nopinion is that the spin temperature has little validity, because all other sources have significant\nWNM column density fractions. This change doesn't affect any other parameters much, nor does\nit affect the conclusion in Paper II that Tkmax for this component lies in the thermally unstable\nrange.\nThe fitting of Gaussians to some sources seems strained. 3C79 (Figure 12) is one example with\na bumpy opacity profile and a nearly triangular expected profile. We fit it successfully with 5 CNM\ncomponents, which seems excessive for a source at Galactic latitude b = \u221235\u25e6 , and a single WNM\ncomponent.\n\n4.6.3.\n\nSources with no CNM components\n\n19 sources exhibit no detectable opacity profile; we fit them only with WNM components. Most\nof these fits are straightforward, requiring one or two rather clearly-defined components. Some are\nmore complicated. 3C263.1 (Figure 13) has three narrower WNM components embedded in a much\nbroader one; the need for the three is clear, but the broad one might be an unreal way to represent\nmore blended components. P0820+22 (Figure 15) is similar, but it also contains one or two WNM\ncomponents that are considerably narrower, with widths comparable to typical CNM components.\n4C19.44 (Figure 14) has three narrow blended WNM components; again, their widths are similar\nto those of typical CNM components, but the errors in the opacity spectrum prevent them from\nbeing detected.\n\n\f\u2013 42 \u2013\n4.7.\n\nTwo illustrative examples of the combined Gaussian fitting process\n\nHere we discuss the fits for two particular sources in some detail to illustrate our Gaussianfitting process. We choose 3C120 and 3C315 because they are typical in most respects, but are\nunusual in the following way. For most sources the variances do not change much for different trials\nof Fk ; the ratios of maximum to minimum variance are usually less than 1.2. However, some sources\nhave significantly larger ratios, and these two sources have the largest, 3.1 and 2.9 respectively. The\nnext highest is 4C19.44 (ratio=1.8).\nFirst a comment on sources that have atypical ratios that exceed 1.4: 3C120, 3C138, 3C315,\n3C318, 3C353, 3C93.1, 4C19.44, NRAO140. Some sources are so extreme that their fits don't even\nconverge for some trials; this happened for 3C123, 3C138, 3C172.0, 3C315, NRAO140. For most\nof these sources, the fits that do converge produce variances that don't differ much.\nWe display the two extreme fits for 3C120 and 3C315 in plots with three panels in Figures 16\nand 17. In the top two panels of these figures we plot the observed expected profile Texp (\u03bd) and the\ntwo extreme fits. For both sources the residuals are smaller when the principal WNM component\nhas F = 0, i.e. it lies fully behind the absorbing CNM components. The absorption of the broad\nWNM component by the narrower CNM ones puts more structure on the central peak of the profile.\n\n4.7.1.\n\n3C120\n\nFigure 16 exhibits the results for 3C120. Note the factors of two and four expansion in vertical\nscale for the residuals and uncertainties on the top two and bottom panels, respectively. First,\nsome general comments about the choice of Gaussian components. The opacity spectrum in the\nbottom panel is fit very well by the three blended CNM components, with residuals smaller than\nthe errors; fitting only two CNM Gaussians makes the residuals unacceptably large. The emission\nspectrum is fit by three WNM Gaussians, one of which is weak and centered at \u201319 km s\u22121 , outside\nthe VLSR plotting range. The other two WNM components are blended: one is wide and weak,\nproviding a floor over which the narrower, more intense WNM Gaussian sits.\nThe residuals and uncertainties are expanded by a factor of two on the top two panels. The\ndiffering residuals are obvious. The residuals are affected almost exclusively by F; the ordering of\nCNM components affects the variance only at the \u223c 2% level, despite the large CNM central optical\ndepths (1.67, 0.74, 0.63). The relative insensitivity of the residuals to CNM ordering is typical.\nThe intense, narrow WNM Gaussian has halfwidth 6.75 \u00b1 0.78 km s\u22121 , corresponding to\nTkmax = 1000 K. From Table 2, its peak intrinsic weighted mean T0,k = 41.3 \u00b1 5.6 K, so that its\npeak opacity \u03c40 \u2265 (41/1000) = 0.041. From the errors on \u03c4 (\u03bd) in the bottom panel, we estimate\nthat a component that has its width and center should not have \u03c40 & 0.02. This is smaller than\nthe 0.041 that we just calculated. Since Tk smaller than 1000 K would produce an even larger\npeak opacity, the true Tk cannot be far below 1000 K; moreover, we could probably include this\n\n\f\u2013 43 \u2013\n\nFig. 16.- Data for 3C120. Top two panels: data and fits having largest (top) and smallest residuals\nfor the trial fits to Texp (\u03bd). Bottom panel: data and fits for the opacity spectrum. For a more\ndetailed description of this figure, see \u00a74.7. Here, the top two panels are similar to the top panel\nin Figure 3, and the bottom panel is like the bottom panel in that figure.\n\n\f\u2013 44 \u2013\ncomponent in the opacity fit, which would slightly reduce the \u03c40 for the other components (and\nthere would be significant uncertainties).\n\n4.7.2.\n\n3C315\n\nFigure 17 exhibits the results for 3C315. The opacity spectrum is fit to within the uncertainties\nby two CNM Gaussians that overlap only slightly. The emission spectrum is very well fit by two\nWNM Gaussians with nearly equal central velocities; one is wide and weak and provides a floor\nover which the the narrower, more intense WNM Gaussian sits. The residuals and uncertainties\nare expanded by a factor of four on the top two panels. The differing residuals are obvious. As for\n3C120, the residuals are affected almost exclusively by F, here because of the small overlap of the\ntwo CNM components.\nThe intense, narrow WNM Gaussian has halfwidth 6.6 \u00b1 1.2 km s\u22121 , corresponding to Tkmax <\n950 K. From Table 2, its peak intrinsic weighted mean T0,k = 12.5 \u00b1 0.4 K, so that its peak opacity\n\u03c40 \u2265 (12.5/950) = 0.013. This is somewhat smaller than the \u223c 0.02 that one visually estimates\nfrom the bottom panel for the upper limit for its opacity, so the results are mutually consistent and\nits true temperature can be (but is not necessarily) somewhat below 950 K, say \u223c 600 K.\n4.7.3.\n\nCommentary\n\nTable 3 illustrates how the CNM spin temperatures Ts and the WNM intrinsic peak brightness\ntemperatures T0 change from the worst and best fits, and also lists the fit adopted in our standard\nTable 2; these values are in the three pairs of columns. We don't show the changes in VLSR or\nlinewidth because they are small. The adopted values from Table 2 are all closer to the best case\nvalues than the worst case ones, and the uncertainties on the adopted values look reasonable given\nthe scatter of the worst/best values.\nOur main results in Table 2 are not those from the particular Fk that yields the smallest variance. The reason is that each derived variance is a result of an independent numerical experiment\nand model fit. The results of each experiment should be regarded as a set of independent estimates\nfor the HI component parameters. As with any set of independent measurements, the best estimate\nfor the derived parameters is an appropriately weighted average of their independent estimates. We\nperform this weighting as described in \u00a73.5.\nThe WNM Gaussian centers and widths (and, to a lesser extent the intensities) are not strongly\naffected by the choice of F. This is easy to understand. We can mentally divide the expected profile\ninto two portions, the \"center\" where the CNM absorption exists and and the \"outside\" where it\ndoes not.\nConsider 3C120 above in Figure 16. In both upper panels, the WNM Gaussian parameters are\n\n\f\u2013 45 \u2013\n\nFig. 17.- Data for 3C315. Top two panels: data and fits having largest (top) and smallest residuals\nfor the trial fits to Texp (\u03bd). Bottom panel: data and fits for the opacity spectrum. For a more\ndetailed description of this figure, see \u00a74.7. Here, the top two panels are similar to the top panel\nin Figure 3, and the bottom panel is like the bottom panel in that figure.\n\n\f\u2013 46 \u2013\ndetermined mainly by the outside portions: after all, it is to represent these outside portions that\nthe WNM component is required. The opacity has no effect on these outside portions; this is why\nthe WNM Gaussian properties don't change much between the two panels.\nIn contrast, the central portion of the expected profile is highly affected by F. The central\nportion, both for 3C120 and 3C137, has narrow structure, and this structure can only come from the\nnarrower opacity components. For these two sources, this narrower structure is best represented by\nallowing the CNM components to absorb the WNM emission from behind. This choice, with WNM\nbehind, means that the WNM contributes less to the emission and the CNM spin temperatures\nmust be larger to compensate.\n\n5.\n\nCOMPARISON OF GAUSSIAN-FIT RESULTS WITH SLOPE METHOD\n\nHere we compare the two methods, both of which provide spin temperatures using physically\ncorrect radiative transfer. For each method we provide two measurements of spin temperature for\nthe two extreme values of F. For F = 0 we designate the slope-derived spin temperatures by the\nsymbols Ts,S,F =0 and the Gaussian-derived ones with Ts,G,F =0 , with equivalent designations for\nF = 1.\nTo obtain spin temperatures with the slope method (\u00a73.2), one makes a \"slope plot\" by plotting\nTexp (\u03bd) versus (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) ) and visually estimates the slope and the intercept. The intercept is\nTE,W N M . For F = 1 the slope is Ts ; for F = 0 the slope is Ts \u2212 TE,W N M (equation 17). Our\ntechnique of Gaussian fitting also provides Ts and TE,W N M .\nBefore beginning, we note that our least-square fits produce reasonable facsimiles of the observed Texp (\u03bd) and e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) profiles. Thus, the slope plot of the observed Texp (\u03bd) versus e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) is very\nsimilar to that of the predicted one, and both provide similar estimates of Ts,S .\nNevertheless, because of the nonuniqueness of Gaussians it is conceivable that the model embodied in our least squares fit bears no relationship to the real situation for a particular source.\nEven so, our fit is a numerical expression of some physical situation that happens to match the\nobserved data, and our Gaussian parameters are necessarily correct for this (perhaps fictitious)\nsituation. Therefore, if the slope method disagrees with the Gaussian parameters for this situation,\nthe slope method is necessarily incorrect for this possibly fictitious situation. In fact, however, we\nbelieve that our Gaussian fits are usually reasonably good approximations to the real situations\nand a disagreement between Ts,S and Ts,G indicates a problem with the slope method.\n\n5.1.\n\nTwo representative examples\n\nWe compare the results derived from the slope method and our Gaussian fits for two representative example sources, one with unblended opacity components and one with blended components.\n\n\f\u2013 47 \u2013\nWe show the results in three-panel plots (Figures 18 and 19) in which the top two panels are the\nusual ones described in \u00a72.8. The bottom panel shows the slope plot of Texp (\u03bd) versus \u03c4 (\u03bd); the\nsolid line is the data and the dashed line the least-squares fit. The heavy dashed lines show the\nvisually-estimated slopes. In the upper left of each bottom panel are the ranges of Ts allowed by\nthe slopes and intercepts.\n\n5.1.1.\n\nUnblended opacity components\n\nFigure 18 exhibits the data for 3C207. There is a pair of well-separated, relatively unblended\nCNM components, with two associated strong WNM components that are slightly blended and\na third weak, narrow WNM component (TK < 100 K) which is embedded in the stronger WNM\ncomponent. Our CNM components have Ts = (18\u00b13, 18\u00b15) K. Each opacity component produces a\nwell-defined lobe on the slope plot; the slopes imply \u223c 17 and 23 K if F = 1, which is in satisfactory\nagreement with our CNM components. This result is typical: in all cases with unblended CNM\nopacity components the slope method works well, even with blended WNM components.\n\n5.1.2.\n\nBlended multicomponent opacity profiles\n\nFigure 19 exhibits the data for P0531+19. The opacity profile has three CNM components,\ntwo narrow ones with Ts = (40 \u00b1 2, 110 \u00b1 3) K for the strong and weak, respectively, connected\nby a broad one with Ts = (171 \u00b1 5) K. The emission profile consists of these plus a single broad\nWNM component. The two narrow CNM components produce well-defined lobes on the slope plot\nwith slopes of \u223c (8, 18) K for the strong and weak one, respectively. The broad CNM component\noverlaps both of the narrow components; it contributes less opacity but as much or more emission\nthan the narrow components. It does not produce a well-defined lobe, so that at the velocity of each\nlobe on the slope plot both a narrow and the wide component contribute. Thus each slope-derived\nspin temperature is in some sense applicable to both its narrow and wide component.\nThe slope-derived temperatures are are much colder than the Gaussian-derived ones. Thus,\nthe slope method doesn't work at all for blended components. It fails because the emission of\na CNM component is not proportional only to its opacity, but rather to the product of opacity\nwith spin temperature. In this example, the spin temperature of the broad opacity component is\nmore than four times higher than that of the stronger narrow component, so the broad component\ndominates the emission while the narrow one dominates the opacity. The emission of the broad\ncomponent doesn't change much over the narrow ones width, so the slope is small.\n\n\f\u2013 48 \u2013\n\nFig. 18.- For 3C207, comparison of Gaussian-derived and slope-derived spin temperatures for\nF = (0, 1).

The\nfirst four sources have no overlapping CNM components. The last six have overlapping components,\nwith one or more Gaussians contributing significantly to the opacity at the velocity of each lobe in\nthe slope plot; the multiple values of Ts,G for these components are listed in square brackets. The\ntable lists temperatures for both F = (0, 1).\nSources like 3C207 with no overlapping components produce good agreement between Ts,G and\nTs,S . But the agreement for sources with overlapping components, like P0531+19, is abysmal.\nWe conclude that the slope method works well when the opacity profile is simple. However,\nwith multiple components it does not work well. We will proceed using our Gaussian fit results.\n\n6.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis paper discusses the observation and reduction techniques of our large survey of the 21-cm\nline in emission and absorption. We use Gaussian components and a simple but physically correct\nmodel to treat the radiative transfer issues. The major topics are as follows.\n1. \u00a72 presents the theory of extracting the opacity and expected profiles from the on- and offsource spectra. We apply this theory to the Arecibo data, which are characterized by several\neffects common to most telescopes but amplified at Arecibo because of its large sidelobes. The\nmost serious instrumental effect is the impossibility of getting a true off-source spectrum; we\ndevelop an observing and reduction technique that not only solves this problem but also\nprovides reliable estimates of uncertainty for the derived opacity and expected profiles. Our\nresults compare well with older data that are correct, but some older data are incorrect.\nSurprisingly, stray radiation has little influence on Arecibo's emission profiles (\u00a74.2.\n2. \u00a73 discusses the radiative transfer of the 21-cm line for the real case in which some of the gas\nis Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and some the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM). We present\na simple, physically correct model for this radiative transfer for which we decompose the\nobserved profiles into Gaussian components; the CNM components are ordered along the line\nof sight so that some absorb the emission of others, and the ensemble of CNM clouds is placed\nan arbitrary fractional distance along the line of sight through the WNM.\nBecause of our inclusion of radiative transfer, we derive spin temperatures that are much\nlower than those from previous work. Our temperatures are comparable to those derived\nfor the Magellanic clouds using the \"slope method\". The slope method is another simple,\nphysically correct model for the radiative transfer and works well for simple profiles, but not\nmulticomponent opacity profiles (\u00a75).\n3. Fitting Gaussians to spectra is a subjective and nonunique process. \u00a74 devotes considerable\n\n\f\u2013 51 \u2013\ndiscussion to our method and process, with many illustrative examples to clarify our subjective biases. For the opacity spectra, we generally fit the minimum number of Gaussians\nrequired to reproduce them to within the uncertainties, and for many sources the number of\nblended Gaussians is small. For the expected emission profiles we fit a \"reasonable\" number\nof additional WNM components (\u00a74.2). We discuss the effect of fitting either too few or too\nmany Gaussians to a line profile and conclude that the derived spin temperatures are not\nvery much affected.\nSome optical observers fit many Gaussians to reproduce line shapes exactly. We argue that\nthis procedure is not necessarily correct because lines are always nonthermally broadened, in\nwhich case lines are not necessarily Gaussians.\n4. Paper II provides a detailed discussion of the WNM and CNM properties, together with other\nastrophysical implications.\n\nWe acknowledge helpful discussions with Robert Braun, John Dickey, Ed Jenkins, Dan Welty,\nand an unknown referee with an eagle eye.
