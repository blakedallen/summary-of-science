Introduction\nThin magnetic films have been the subject of\nintense attention over the last two decades [1\u20133].\nThese studies have been motivated both by the\ntechnological importance of these systems and by\nthe insight that they provide into the fundamental\nrole of interactions at the atomic level. Advances in\nfilm growth techniques and experimental control of\nspin-spin interactions have impulsed this interest.\nIt is well established now the fundamental role\nof competing interactions in the emerging feaPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\ntures of low dimensional systems. Among a wide\nscope of theoretical and numerical investigations\non equilibrium[4\u20136] and dynamical properties[7\u20139]\nof several model Hamiltonian of low-dimensional\nmagnetic systems, Heisenberg-like models are one\nof the most intensively used to approach real magnetic materials.[10,4] In fact, anisotropic versions\nof the Heisenberg model describe several compounds as BaCo2 (AsO4 )2 ,[11] CoCl2 -GIC[12] and\nRb2 CrCl4 [13]\nSome effort in the study of the non-equilibrium\nregime of closely related models has been done[14\u2013\nMay 2011\n\n\f17] and a detailed characterization of the equilibrium features of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian considering a dipolar long-range repulsive term and\na varying perpendicular anisotropy were depicted\nby numerical and analytical methods in the last\nfew years.[4,18,19] In particular, the transition in\nwhich spins reorient from an in-plane ferromagnetic order to an out-plane perpendicular stripes\nwith decreasing temperature, already seen in experimental works,[20] was encountered in a welllocalized anisotropy range. However, a complete\ncharacterization of this system is far from been established, and that is particularly true in relation\nwith its dynamical behavior. In this paper we want\nto make a step forward in this direction.\nThrough Monte Carlo simulations we study the\ndynamics of the model analyzing the magnetic relaxation behavior for several values of temperature. We explore dynamical properties in two different ordered regions of the phase space near the\nSpin Reorientation Transition. We show that there\nis a temperature T \u2217 below which the dynamic slows\ndown. This behavior is present for the two phases\naround the reorientation transition. We explain\nthis behavior in terms of non-Arrhenius relaxation\ndue to complex domain dynamics.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In section 2\nwe present the model making a review of some of\nits more relevant properties and give details about\nthe Monte Carlo simulations. Then, in section 3\nwe present and discuss our results understanding\nthe anomalous behavior of magnetic relaxation by\nmeans of the analysis of the domains dynamics and\nthe energy barriers associated to the different regions. Finally, section 4 is devoted to summarize\nour results and present the conclusions of the work.\n\n+\n\nX\ni6=j\n\n(~si * ~rij )(~sj * ~rij )\n~si * ~sj\n\u22123\n3\n5\nrij\nrij\n\n!\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the exchange \u03b4 and anisotropy constants \u03b7\nare normalized relative to the dipolar coupling constant, < i, j > stands for a sum over nearest neighbors pairs of sites in the lattice, (i, j) stands for a\nsum over all distinct pairs and rij = |~ri \u2212 ~rj | is the\ndistance between spins i and j.\nRecently, Carubelli et all[4] determined the \u03b7-T\nphase diagram of this model by means of Monte\nCarlo simulations. Maintaining the same relative\nstrength between exchange and dipolar interactions they showed the existence of two different\nordered phases at low temperature. A planar ferromagnet or a perpendicular striped phase establishes depending on the value of \u03b7. Moreover, the\ndiagram obtained in [4] qualitatively reproduces\ndetailed measurements of the reorientation transition encountered experimentally in samples of\nFe/Ni/Cu(001)[20] suggesting that the film thickness acts as an effective inverse anisotropy.\n8\n7.5\n\nperpendicular\nstripes\n\n\u03b7\n\n7\n\nparamagnet\n\n6.5\n6\n\nplanar ferromagnet\n\n5.5\n5\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nT\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFig. 1.

Model and simulation\nWe focused on the study of quenches for a system of size N = 48 \u00d7 48 and \u03b4 = 3 from full out-ofplane magnetized configurations into planar and\nstriped ordered regions. Several temperatures below T = 0.9 corresponding to the ordered phases\nwere explored for two anisotropy values \u03b7 = 5.5\nand \u03b7 = 7.0. In figure 1 a scheme of the phase diagram is shown and the Spin Reorientation Transition is marked with a bold line.\n\nWe consider a two-dimensional square lattice of\nHeisenberg spins of unit modulus |~si | = 1 with an\nanisotropy perpendicular to the plane of the lattice, interacting through the dimensionless Hamiltonian\nX\nX\n~si * ~sj +\n(szi )2 \u2212 \u03b4\nH = \u2212\u03b7\ni\n\nhiji\n\n2\n\n\fAll the simulations were done using the\nMetropolis algorithm and infinite periodic boundary conditions were imposed on the lattice by\nmeans of the Ewald sums technique. The trial for\nthe spin flip was chosen as a random orientation\nuniformly distributed in the sphere.\nThe time evolution P\nof the out-of-plane magz\nnetization Mz = 1/N\ni si was recorded starting from the saturated configuration szi = 1.\nThe behavior of this observable is in all cases a\nmonotonous decay to zero due to the lack of total\nmagnetization of the striped configurations as well\nas the complete in-plane orientation of spins in the\nplanar-ferromagnetic phase. Typical time orders\nin Monte Carlo steps were t = 105 m.c.s. and averages over thermal noise involved a few hundred\nof realizations. In the quench to the striped phase\n\u03b7 = 7.0, it was impossible to relax the system at\ntemperatures below T = 0.4.

Out-plane magnetization for several temperatures\nwith \u03b7 = 5.5 (up) and \u03b7 = 7.0 (down).\n\nWe start showing in figure 2 the out-of-plane\nmagnetization relaxation corresponding to both\nquenches at different temperatures.\nAs can be seen there is a central difference between quenches in the two ordered regions. For\n\u03b7 = 7.0 the ground state of the system is a striped\nconfiguration and, as we already mentioned, there\nexists a temperature T = 0.4 below which the dynamics completely freezes. Contrary to the \u03b7 = 5.5\ncase where degeneration of planar ferromagnetic\nground state facilitates domain relaxation, for \u03b7 =\n7.0 the dynamical flipping of spins corresponding\nto adjacent striped domains is naturally slower.\nThe scaling of Mz for \u03b7 = 5.5 at high temperatures is shown in figure 3 as a function of T ln(t/\u03c40 ).\nThere was no possible scaling in this functionality\nfor lower temperatures.\nIt means that below T \u2264 T \u2217 = 0.5 the system\ndoes not longer relax following the Arrhenius law.\n[21] In fact, despite many works validating the applicability of the scaling of figure 3 to interacting\nsystems,[22,16] there is no guarantee that interacting spins may be always described in terms of\n\n1\n\nT=0.9\nT=0.8\nT=0.7\nT=0.6\n\n0.8\n\nMz\n\n0.6\n\u03c40=7.0\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-2 -1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2 3 4\nT log(t/\u03c40)\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFig. 3. Scaling of magnetization for several temperatures\nwith \u03b7 = 5.5.\n\nthermal activation of the Arrhenius type.\nThe most simple and common extension for\nthe Arrhenius equation is the well known VogelFulcher-Tammann (VFT) law which is given by\nU\n\n\u03c4 (E) = \u03c40 e T \u2212T0\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere the new parameter T0 is known as the VFT\ntemperature. This functionality provides usually\na good description of experimental and numerical\ndata and is the salient phenomenological description for the \u03b1-relaxation dynamics of glass-forming\nsystems.[23]\nAlthough the microscopic origin of the VFT law\nis still under debate, it is generally accepted that\na clue feature of it is the notion of cooperativity in\nthe movement of the elementary constituents of the\nsystem. Thus, many theories of the glass transition\nare based on the assumption that cooperatively rearranging regions (domains or clusters) merges at\nlow temperatures. Inside them magnetic moments\nmove in some concerted way that distinguishes\nthese regions from their surroundings.[24,25]\n1\n\u03c40=7\n\n0.6\n\nT0=-0.5\n\nMz\n\n0.8\n\nVFT law\n\n\u03c4\n\n104\n\n103\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nT=0.5\nT=0.4\nT=0.3\nT=0.2\nT=0.1\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n(T-T0) log[t/\u03c40]\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nplot of \u03c4 and its fit using the VFT form.

Collapse is\nobtained for \u03c40 = 7 and T0 = \u22120.5.\n\n\u03c40=3.5\n\n0.4\n\nFrom expression (2) it is direct to see that the\nexpected scaling variable now takes the form (T \u2212\nT0 ) ln(t/\u03c40 ). In figure 4 this scaling is shown for\ntemperatures below T = .5. On the contrary, there\nis no collapse for higher temperatures where the\ndata follows the typical Arrhenius relaxation seen\nin figure 3. It is worth to note that the value of\nthe parameters for the best collapse are shown in\nthe figure and involve a negative VFT temperature\nT0 = \u22120.5. As far as we know, this feature has\nbeing observed only in a few materials[26,27] and\nits interpretation remains unclear.\nIn order to confirm this unusual feature we studied the relaxation times \u03c4 (T ) defined as the time\nat which the out-plane magnetization decays to a\nvalue Mz = 0.01. In figure 5 we see the Arrhenius\n\n0.2\n0\n-2 -1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2 3 4 5\nT log(t/\u03c40)\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFig. 6. Scaling of magnetization for several temperatures\nwith \u03b7 = 7.0.\n\nFor the \u03b7 = 7.0 case figure 6 shows that the\nArrhenius-like relaxation holds down to a temperature T \u2217 = 0.4. The data corresponding to T =\n0.4 was impossible to collapse in the same figure\nand, since it is the only relaxation data below the\nArrhenius zone, a proper collapse considering expression (2) can not be found. The freezing of the\nsystem is stronger that for the case \u03b7 = 5.5.\n4\n\n\f3.1. Cluster Analysis\nNow it is worth to do a more deep study to understand the nature of the slow-down encountered\nthat makes the system to apart from the Arrhenius law and may eventually freeze the relaxation\ndynamics. Firstly, the disagreement with the logarithmic scaling and better adjusting to a VFT relation reflects an intrinsic physical phenomenology\nof the model under study. That is, the emergence\nof larger times for the cooperative relaxations as\ntemperature is decreased below T \u2217 . Moreover, the\ndynamical freezing for \u03b7 = 7.0 could be a feature\ncoming from the combined action of the slow nonArrhenius relaxation and the context of a ground\nstate of perpendicular-oriented spins that naturally develops higher relaxation times due to higher\nenergy barriers between local minima.\nDue to the three-dimensional nature of the spins\nin the system, the visual inspection of the configurations involves two type of formats: the in-plane\nand the out-plane projection. For the in-plane projection of the spins we use the format shown in the\nleft side of figure 7. There, the spin is represented\nwith a single arrow and the dark intensity is proportional to the modulus of the projection, so that\nwhite corresponds to a completely out-plane spin.\nOn the other hand, for the out-plane projection\nthe format is seen in the right side of the same figure. In this case every spin is a tiny square and the\nmodulus of the out-plane projection goes from \u22121\n(blue) to 1 (red), so that white corresponds to a\ncompletely in-plane spin.\nFigure 7 shows a typical evolution of the system with \u03b7 = 5.5 and T = 0.6. Starting from the\nfully out-plane magnetized state, the spins begin\nto depart from this position, some of them even\ninverting its original direction. At some point several ground-state in-plane domains merges, these\ndomains are eventually separated by out-plane\nstructures that continuously disappears as the\ntime grows and equals \u03c4 and the system orders as\na planar ferromagnet.\nIn order to compare this evolution for several\ntemperatures we have to be careful. Since even in\nthe Arrhenius regime (T > T \u2217 ) it is clear that the\nrelaxation slows with decreasing temperature, di-\n\nFig. 7. Typical system configurations for the \u03b7 = 5.5 quench\nat T = 0.6 and several times. The left (right) side shows\nthe in-plane (out-plane) projection of the spins. From up\nto down correspondent times are t = 64, 256, 1024, 16385.\n\nrect inspections to complete evolutions above and\nbelow T \u2217 does not leads to useful conclusions. Instead, what we do is to fix certain equivalent stage,\nMz = 0.5, in the relaxation process at different\ntemperatures and then inspect the typical configurations.\nFigures 8 and 9 are typical configurations above\nand below T \u2217 respectively for which Mz = 0.5,\n5\n\n\fFig. 8. Typical system configurations for the \u03b7 = 5.5 quench\nat Mz = 0.5 and several temperatures above T \u2217 . From up\nto down T = 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5.\n\nFig. 9. Typical system configurations for the \u03b7 = 5.5 quench\nat Mz = 0.5 and several temperatures below T \u2217 . From up\nto down T = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1.\n\nthat is, in an equivalent macroscopic stage of the\nrelaxation. The figures show several temperatures\nand again it is clear that the type of relaxation\nis different between the high and low temperature\nregions. Above T \u2217 the out-plane magnetization is\nmainly supported by uncorrelated spins that remains with a non-zero out-plane projection. On\nthe other hand, below T \u2217 the same magnetization\n\nis due to well-structured out-plane reminiscences\nthat exactly corresponds with the defects of the\ncooperative in-plane ferromagnetic clusters. That\nis, for lower temperatures the depart from outplane saturation is characterized by the movement\nof highly correlated domains of in-plane spins or,\nwhat is the same, by the slow movement of welldefined (out-plane) defects of these in-plane struc6\n\n\fto reach the ground state. For higher temperatures\nthe system is able to relax to a configuration in\nwhich the correct striped domains merges. On the\nother hand for T = 0.4 the evolution is frustrated\nby an abnormal growth of the stripes width.\n\ntures.\n\n3.2. Energy barriers distributions\nIn previous works[22,16] it has been shown that,\nin the range of validity of the T ln(t/\u03c40 ) scaling, the\neffective distribution of energy barriers (fb (E))\ncontributing to the long time relaxation process\ncan be obtained from the magnetic relaxation\ncollapse simply by performing its logarithmic\ntime derivative dM (t)/dln(t). That is, studying\nthe magnetic viscosity S. This distribution fb (E)\nrepresents a time independent distribution that\nwould give rise to an identical relaxation curve.\nThis quantity is calculated in this subsection from\nthe numerical data.\nMoreover, non-Arrhenius relaxation following\nequation (2) can be seen as a simple rescaling of\nT . Thus, since the derivation of S \u223c fb (E) does\nnot involve temperature derivatives,[28] the terms\nremain unchanged and the relation between magnetic viscosity and energy barriers distribution\nstill holds. So we are able to obtain the statistical information of the energy barriers above and\nbelow the dynamical transition temperature.\n0.9\n0.8\n*\n\n0.7\n\nT>T Arrhenius\n\nfb(E)\n\n0.6\n\nT<T* VFT\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\nFig. 10.

In this case in-plane\nviews shows no order and no significant spin projections and therefore are uninteresting. As can be\nseen, the structure of the out-plane projections at\nT = 0.4 are consistent with an increasing difficulty\n\nFig. 11. Energy barriers distribution explored for the system with \u03b7 = 5.5 above and below T \u2217 .\n\nThe results shown in figure 11 for the two different dynamical regimes at \u03b7 = 5.5 confirms our\nexpectations. Indeed, the slower non-Arrhenius re7\n\n\flaxation involve higher energy barriers due to the\ncooperative nature of the domains movement.\nIn the \u03b7 = 7.0 case some light can be spread\non its anomalous behavior. If the energy barriers\nthe system has to overcome are high enough, a\nMonte Carlo out-equilibrium dynamics freezes in\nsome metastable configuration. So, it is worth to\ncomparing the form of fb (E) between the quench\nto planar ferromagnetic phase and to the perpendicular striped region. Figure 12 shows the result\nof analysis of energy barriers in the two regions in\nwhich the Arrhenius relation holds.\n\nnamics suggests the existence of a dynamical temperature transition T \u2217 . Below this temperature the\ndynamics changes from an Arrhenius to a VFT\ntype (\u03b7 = 5.5) or the system freezes (\u03b7 = 7.0).\nThe interpretation of this anomalous slow down\nis understood as a result of the change from the\nsingle-spin elementary movement to a new mechanism based on the coherent movement of the oriented ground-state domains. The same explanation can be done in terms of the pinning of the defects merging in the frontiers of ground-state domains of different orientations. This explanation is\nconfirmed by the analysis of typical configurations\nduring the dynamics and by the shape of the energy barriers distributions obtained studying the\nmagnetic viscosity of the model above and below\nT \u2217.\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\u03b7=5.5\n\n0.7\n\nfb(E)\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n5.

The\nshape of the distribution in the \u03b7 = 7.0 case is also\nwider suggesting a heterogeneous distribution of\ndomains.\nThis picture supports our believe that, once the\nsystem has formed striped structures, the energy\nbarriers to be overcome are higher. Indeed they are\nso high that they can eventually freeze below T \u2217 .\n\nReferences\n[1] A. B. MacIsaac, J. P. Whitehead, M. C. Robinson,\nand K. De'Bell. Phys. Rev. B, 51:1023, 1995.\n[2] Y.
