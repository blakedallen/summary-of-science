Introduction\nPolarized muon decay at rest (PMDaR) is the appropriate laboratory\nto test both Lorentz structure and violation of combined symmetry CP of\nthe purely leptonic charged weak interactions [1, 2]. In addition, the above\nprocess may be used to probe the question of lepton number violation [3].\nThe various low energy precise measurements of muon decay such as; the\nspectral shape, angular distribution, and polarization of the outgoing electrons (positrons) led among other to a vector-axial (V-A) structure [4] of\nthe electroweak interactions of Standard Model (SM)[5, 6, 7]. This means\nthat only left-chirality Dirac neutrinos may take part in the charged and\nneutral current weak interaction. The V-A coupling also leads to maximal\nparity violation and massless neutrinos. Although the SM agrees with all\ndata up to presently available energies, it contains the large number of undetermined parameters, so the existence of new physics is expected. One\nof the fundamental aspects, which are not explained in the SM, is the origin of parity violation at current energies. In addition, the experimental\nprecision still does not rule out the participation of the exotic weak interactions with right-chirality neutrinos. This situation led to the formulation of\nvarious non-standard gauge models, which have the SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1) as own\nsubgroup and their predictions agree with the SM at low energies. Many\ntheoretical schemes going beyond the SM include new interactions whose\nstructure is different from V-A. There is a rich literature concerning nonstandard models. We mean here the various versions of left-right symmetric\nmodels (LRSM) with the SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R \u00d7 U (1) as the gauge group [8]\nand the models including mechanisms which admit scalar, tensor and pseudoscalar structures. The LRSM emerged first in the framework of grand\nunified theories (GUT). They restore the parity symmetry at high energies\nand give its violation at low energies as a result of gauge symmetry breaking.\nThe mentioned above muon decay is still one of the basic processes used\nin searching for effects connected with the V + A weak interaction at low\nenergies and possibility of CP violation. There are many theoretical and experimental papers concerning these aspects [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. At present,\nthere is no experimental evidence for the deviations from the SM for the\nMichel parameters [14]. These parameters contain only contributions from\nthe right-chirality neutrinos in the form of sums of the squares of certain\ncombinations of the coupling constants. It seems meaningful to search for\nnew observables with the linear contributions from the right-chirality couplings. The proper candidates can be neutrino observables, including an\ninformation on the transverse components of neutrino spin polarization,\nboth T-even and T-odd. Today, direct measurements of such observables in\nthe PMDaR are impossible, so a reasonable solution seems to be the scat-\n\n\f3\n\ntering of polarized neutrino beam coming from the PMDaR off electrons of\ntarget. A signature of existence of the right-chirality neutrinos would be\ndetection of deviation from the SM prediction in the recoil electron angular\ndistribution. However, high-precision measurements of the neutrino observables require large detectors and strong polarized (anti)neutrino sources,\nand long time of experiment duration (one year and longer). Moreover, the\ndetectors should measure both polar angle and azimuthal angle of the outgoing electron momentum with a high resolution, and must also distinguish\nthe electrons from various potential background sources (e.g., the electron\nproduced by neutrino-nucleon scattering can give a final state that is often consistent with a single recoil electron coming from neutrino-electron\nscattering). New types of detectors with a very low threshold \u221d 10 eV\nare intensively developed by many groups. We mean the silicon cryogenic\ndetectors based on the ionization-into-heat conversion effect and the high\npurity germanium detectors with the internal amplification of a signal in the\nelectric field [15]. It is also worth mentioning that TRIUMF Collaboration\ncarried out the precise measurement with the decay of polarized muons at\nrest. In order to minimize depolarization effects the muons were stopped in\nthe pure metal foil and liquid-He targets [1].\nIn this paper, we focus on the study of the PMDaR (production process\nof polarized muon-neutrino beam) and of the ENES (detection process of\nexotic effects) in the presence of V+A interaction, assuming Dirac massive\n(anti)neutrinos. Our analysis is not made in the framework of concrete\nversion of the left-right symmetric model. The main goal is to show how the\nangle-energy distribution of the muon neutrinos produced in the PMDaR\ndepends on the interference terms between the standard vector coupling of\nthe left-chirality neutrinos and exotic vector couplings of the right-chirality\nones. It will allow to calculate the flux of muon neutrinos, both for the\nSM prediction and the case of neutrino left-right mixture. Next, we will\ncalculate the expected number of events in the ENES, when the incoming\nneutrino beam comes from the PMDaR and is transversely polarized. The\nneutrino flux and event number are found for a detector in the shape of flat\ncircular ring with a low threshold.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Sec. II contains a basic assumptions as to the production process of muon-neutrino beam. In the sec. III,\nthe results for the energy-angle distribution of muon neutrinos coming from\nthe PMDaR are presented. In the sec. IV we present the numerical results concerning the neutrino flux and expected number of events both for\nthe SM with only left-chirality muon neutrinos and the case of left-right\nchirality muon-neutrino mixture, when muon-neutrino beam is transversely\npolarized. Finally, we summarize our considerations.\nThe results are presented in a limit of infinitesimally small mass for all\n\n\f4\n\nCoupling constants\n\nSM\n\nCurrent limits\n\nV |\n|gLL\nV\n|gLR |\nV |\n|gRL\nV\n|gRR |\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n> 0.960\n< 0.036\n< 0.104\n< 0.034\n\nTable 1.

Polarized muon decay at rest - basic assumptions\nWe assume that the polarized muon decay at rest (\u03bc\u2212 \u2192 e\u2212 + \u03bd e + \u03bd\u03bc )\nis a source of the muon neutrino beam. This process is described at a level\nof lepton-number-conserving four-fermion point interaction. We admit a\nV\npresence of the exotic vector gLR,RL,RR\ncouplings in addition to the stanV\ndard vector gLL coupling. It means that the outgoing muon neutrino flux\nis a mixture of the left-chirality and right-chirality muon neutrinos.

The table 1 displays\nhelicity, see [13]. In the SM, only gLL\nV , gV\nthe current limits for the gLL\nLR,RL,RR couplings.

The production\nplane is spanned by the direction of the muon polarization \u03b7\u0302\u03bc and of the\noutgoing muon neutrino LAB momentum unit vector q\u0302. As is well known,\nin this plane, the polarization vector \u03b7\u0302\u03bc can be expressed, with respect to\nthe q\u0302, as a sum of the longitudinal component of the muon polarization\n\u22a5 , which is\n(\u03b7\u0302\u03bc * q\u0302)q\u0302 and transverse component of the muon polarization \u03b7\u03bc\n\u22a5 = \u03b7\u0302 \u2212 (\u03b7\u0302 * q\u0302)q\u0302.\ndefined as \u03b7\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n3.

We also see that the interference terms do not vanish in the limit of vanishing electron-antineutrino\nand muon-neutrino masses. This independence of the neutrino mass enables the measurement of the relative phases \u03b1, \u03b2 between these couplings.\nThe interference part, Eq.

In order to show this,\nwe use the final density matrix for the mass states m1 , m2 of \u03bdmu to avoid\nbreaking the fundamental principles of Quantum Field Theory. We assume\nthat at the neutrino detector (target) \u03bd\u03bc = cos\u03b8\u03bd1 + sin\u03b8\u03bd2 .

Neutrino flux and number of events in neutrino-electron\nscattering\nIn order to find the neutrino flux, we assume that the hypothetical detector has the shape of flat circular ring with a low threshold Teth = 10 eV\n(yeth = 0.0062) corresponding to E\u03bdmin = 1603.44 eV . In addition, one assumes that neutrino source is located in the center of the ring detector\nand polarized perpendiculary to the ring. It means that we must integrate\nthe angle-energy distribution of muon neutrinos over the neutrino energy\nin the range [1603.44 eV, m\u03bc /2], and over the d\u03a9\u03bd in the proper range, i.e.\n\u03c6\u03bd \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], \u03b8\u03bd \u2208 [\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b4, \u03c0/2 + \u03b4]. Then, it is multiplied by SND\u03bc yet,\nwhere N\u03bc = 1021 is the number of polarized muons decaying per one year.\nSD = 4\u03c0R2 sin\u03b4, where R = L = 2205 cm is the inner radius of the detector that is equal to the distance between the muon neutrino source and\ndetector, \u03b4 = 0.01. In this way one gets the information on the number of\nmuon neutrinos passing through SD in the direction perpendicular to the\nN\n\u03b7\u0302\u03bc . Fig. 1 shows the dependence of SD\u03bc d\u0393\ndy on the y for the muon neutrinos\nemitted perpendicular to \u03b7\u0302\u03bc , when V +A interaction is admitted. The most\nstringent contribution comes from the left-chirality neutrinos and it is of order of 1019 . The interference gives the contribution of order of 1016 . Fig.2\nN\nd\u0393\nillustrates the plot of SD\u03bc d(cos\u03b8\nas a function of \u03b8\u03bd (angle between \u03b7\u0302\u03bc and\n\u03bd)\nq\u0302) for L-R mixture.

To calculate the expected event number, we assume that\nthe detector with high efficiency (\u01eb(y) = 1 at the muon neutrino energies\nabove threshold) contains a large number of electrons in the fiducial volume (Ne = 2.097 * 1034 corresponds to the 75 Kton of the Fe).

In our case the incoming neutrino beam is the mixture of the leftL weak interactions and\nchirality neutrinos detected in the standard gVL , gA\nR\nR\nright-chirality ones detected in the exotic gV , gA weak interactions. We see\nthat all the interference terms between the standard and exotic couplings\nvanish in the massless neutrino limit. There are only squared contributions\nfrom exotic couplings proportional to the the longitudinal neutrino polarization. It is necessary to point out that there is an observable containing\nthe linear contributions from the exotic couplings which are independent of\nthe neutrino mass. We mean the angular distribution of outgoing neutrinos,\nbut such a measurement is totally unrealistic.\nThe number of events is found as result of integration of the differential\ncross section over the Te in the range [Teth = 10 eV, Te (E\u03bd )]. So, the received\nexpression together with the spectral function integrates over the E\u03bd in the\nrange [1603.44 eV, m\u03bc /2)]. Finally, we must multiply it by N\u03bc /SD .\nUsing the available data [14, 18, 19], we get the flux of neutrino beam\nand the number of events both for the SM and the case of left-right mixture,\nsee table 2.\n\n\f11\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we investigated the PMDaR and ENES in the presence of\nthe exotic V + A interaction, when the (anti)neutrinos have Dirac nature\nand are massive.\nWe have shown that the angle-energy distribution of muon neutrinos proV\nduced in the PMDaR includes the terms with interference between the gLL\nV\n(left-chirality \u03bd\u03bc ) and exotic gLR\n(right-chirality \u03bd\u03bc ) couplings, which are\nindependent of the muon neutrino and electron antineutrino masses. These\ninterferences are exclusively proportional to the T-even and T-odd trans\u22a5.\nverse components of neutrino polarization \u03b7\u03bc\nNext, we have calculated the angular distribution of recoil electrons for the\nENES, when the incoming polarized neutrino beam comes from the PMDaR. We have demonstrated that the laboratory differential cross section\ncontains only the squared contributions from the exotic couplings, because\nall the interferences are suppressed by the neutrino mass. It means that the\nangular distribution should be azimuthally symmetric. It is worth noting\nthat the SM also predicts the similar regularity for the angular distribution.\nUsing the current data, we have computed the flux of muon neutrinos and\nexpected event number for a given configuration of detector, both for the\nSM prediction and for the case of L-R neutrino mixture.\nUnfortunately, the detection of new effects at present experimental precision\nwould be very difficult, even if one had the strong neutrino source (1021 or\nmore polarized muons decaying at rest per year) and the high-precision large\ndetector (1034 or more target-electrons) with the low threshold, measuring\nboth polar angle and azimuthal angle of the outgoing electron momentum.\nWe have also displayed that the eventual effects connected with the neutrino\nmass and mixing in the spectral function are totally inessential (\u223c 10\u221219 ).\nWe plan to search for the other polarized (anti)neutrino beams, which\ncould be interesting from the aspect of observable effects caused by the\nexotic right-chirality states. We expect some interest of the neutrino laboratories working with polarized muon decay and artificial (anti)neutrino\nsources, and neutrino beams, e.g. KARMEN, PSI, TRIUMF, BooNE, SUPERKAMIOKANDE.\nAppendix A\nAppendix: Four-vector of antineutrino spin polarization and density\noperator\nThe formula for the spin polarization 4-vector of massive neutrino S \u2032 moving\nwith the momentum q is as follows:\nS \u2032 = (S \u20320 , S\u2032 ),\n\n(A.1)\n\n\f12\n\n|q|\n(\u03b7\u0302\u03bd * q\u0302),\nm\u03bd\n\u0013\n\u0012\nE\u03bd\n(\u03b7\u0302\u03bd * q\u0302)q\u0302 + \u03b7\u0302\u03bd \u2212 (\u03b7\u0302\u03bd * q\u0302)q\u0302 ,\nS\u2032 =\nm\u03bd\n\nS \u20320 =\n\n(A.2)\n(A.3)\n\nwhere \u03b7\u0302\u03bd is the unit 3-vector of the neutrino polarization in its rest frame.\nThe formula for the density operator of the polarized neutrino in the limit\nof vanishing neutrino mass m\u03bd is given by:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n[(q \u03bc \u03b3\u03bc ) + m\u03bd ] 1 + \u03b35 (S \u2032\u03bc \u03b3\u03bc )\nm\u03bd \u21920 2\n\nlim \u039b(s)\n= lim\n\u03bd\n\nm\u03bd \u21920\n\n=\n\u0010\n\n1\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001a\n\nh\n\n(q \u03bc \u03b3\u03bc ) 1 + \u03b35 (\u03b7\u0302\u03bd * q\u0302) + \u03b35 S \u2032\u22a5 * \u03b3\n\u0011\n\ni\u001b\n\n,\n\n\u001b\n\n(A.4)\n\nwhere S \u2032\u22a5 = 0, \u03b7\u03bd\u22a5 = \u03b7\u0302\u03bd \u2212 (\u03b7\u0302\u03bd * q\u0302)q\u0302 .
