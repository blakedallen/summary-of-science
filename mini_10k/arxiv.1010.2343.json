A granular damper is a container partly filled by\ngranular particles which may be attached to vibrating machinery to attenuate the amplitude of the oscillations. In its regime\nof operation, the granular material is in a gaseous state and\nits dynamics is determined primarily by the interparticle collisions rather than by long-lasting sliding contacts between the\ngrains. Static granular dampers (e.g., Refs. [9, 10]) which\nexploit the rheology of granular matter and impact dampers\n(e.g., Refs. [11\u201314]), where only one or few particles are located in a cavity and dissipate energy in collisions with the\nwalls of the container, are not considered here.\nGranular dampers have a number of properties which are\ndesirable in a wide range of technical applications: Unlike traditional dampers, granular dampers do not require an anchor\nin order to restrict the motion of the system. This is advantageous for damping in portable equipment and in space applications where no fixed anchor is available. Granular dampers\nare extremely simple devices consisting solely of particles enclosed in a container or cavity and require very little maintenance. Granular dampers do not suffer from significant aging\nwhen compared to the oil and rubber components of traditional dampers. Finally, granular dampers can operate over\na wide range of temperatures without performance degradation as the mechanics of the particle-particle and particle-wall\ninteractions exhibit only a weak dependence on the temperature. Modern technical applications of granular dampers include the damping of blade integrated disks (blisks) for compressors [15], structural vibration damping [16\u201318], noise reduction of bank note processing machines [19] and others.\nPerhaps the most common application is the dead-blow hammer [20] and in other impact damping handles [21].\nThe macroscopic damping properties of granular dampers\nunder dynamic load is complicated, highly non-linear, and\nthere is no straightforward way to optimize their performance\n\nfor a given situation. This has been demonstrated in a number\nof experiments and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations,\nincluding investigations on the attenuation of a free spring\nor cantilever with an attached granular damper [5, 7, 22\u201324].\nThe response of an oscillating cantilever with respect to periodic forcing has also been studied [25\u201330]. Even more complex systems have been investigated, such as the oscillation\nmodes of a plate with an abundance of granulate filled cavities [31\u201334] with the aim of noise reduction [19]. For simple systems, such as cantilever oscillators, some progress has\nbeen made. Theoretical models have been developed based on\nphenomenological descriptions of the multiphase gas-particle\nflow of granular matter for attenuating oscillations [35] and\nalso for driven steady state oscillations [36].\nA granular damper, that is a dynamical system of dissipative interacting particles, obviously must be able to dissipate\nenergy; however, its general behavior is not clear \u00e1 priori.\nProperties, such as the dissipation rate, are complex functions\nof the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation, as well as\nthe particle properties, the extension and characteristics of the\ncontainer or cavities, and the filling fractions. More work is\nneeded in this field to generate experimental results and corresponding models capable of describing the dynamics of granular dampers.\nSaluena et al. [1] have shown that several regimes of energy\ndissipation exist for a granular damper and that the transitions\nbetween these regimes are determined primarily by the influence of gravity. An efficient operation of a granular damper\ncan be expected only if the average kinetic energy of the particles is much larger than their average potential energy and the\ndamper operates in the dynamic or collisional regime. In order to carefully investigate this regime, the influence of gravity\nshould be minimized and experimental investigations should\nbe performed under conditions of weightlessness.\nThe objective of this paper is to develop an effective model\nfor the energy dissipation of a granular damper operating in\nthe collisional regime. Our approach is as follows: First,\nexperiments in microgravity are performed and the attenuation of a spring with an attached granular damper for several sets of parameters is obtained (Sec. II). A model capable of reproducing the experimental results is also developed\nand high-precision Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations are performed (Sec. III). The two free parameters of\n\n\f2\nthe model (inelasticities) are obtained by adjusting the values\nuntil the simulation matches the experiment as closely as possible for a single experiment (Sec. III C). From the excellent\nagreement of the simulation results for the fitted system and\nfor all other experiments, it is concluded that the model underlying the simulation replicates the system's essential features (Sec. III D). Thus, the DEM simulations are an effective model for granular damping in the collisional regime. In\nSec. IV, a simple equation for the optimal design of a simple\ndamper is derived and tested against the results of the DEM\nsimulations. Section V discusses the observed linear decay of\nthe amplitude and compares it to friction-damped oscillators.\nFinally, in Sec. VI the conclusions of the paper are outlined.\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nFigure 1 is a diagram of the experimental setup. Our granular damper comprises of a container of adjustable length\nwhich is partially filled with granular material. The damper\nis mounted to one end of a spring-steel blade and the opposite\nend is clamped in a solid aluminum base plate. The spring\nblade is described fully in Sec. III C. The rectangular damper\ncontainer is constructed from 5 mm thick transparent polycarbonate plates. The internal dimensions of the container\nare 50 mm\u00d750 mm\u00d7L, where the length L (in the direction\nof the oscillation) is adjusted by altering the spacing of the\nend walls. The container's net weight (without granulate) is\nM = 434 g. In this work, four different container lengths of\nL = 40, 65, 85, and 104 mm are used. The damper is loaded\nwith 37 precision steel ball-bearings of diameter \u03c3 = 10 mm\nand mass m = 4.04 g. This number of particles is chosen as\nit packs to form a dense layer, two particles deep, on the end\nwalls of the container.\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the experimental setup in front view (left) and\nside view (right). The curvature of the oscillations is exaggerated for\nthe purpose of illustration.\n\nThe motion of the damper and contained granulate is\n\nrecorded using a high speed camera (MotionScope M3TM ),\nwhich records at a frame rate of 500 fps and with a spatial resolution of 1024 \u00d7 1280 pixels. A 45\u25e6 mirror is placed at the\nside of the container and allows for the simultaneous observation of the granulate from the top and the side. The position\nof the damper and the center of gravity of the particles are\nextracted from the top-view using standard image processing\ntechniques. Although the side view facilitates more complex\nmethods of reconstruction, it will be shown that the motion of\nthe granulate is well described by the center of mass motion.\nAll position measurements are made in a 2D plane which is\nparallel to and intersecting the top of the container while it is\nin its equilibrium position. Although this introduces some error at the peaks of the oscillations due to the curved damper\ntrajectory, this error is negligible.\nAt the start of the experiment, the spring blade is deflected\nand held at the initial displacement of \u22060 = 107.5 mm using\nan electromagnet. A trigger mechanism begins the experiment\nand starts the camera recording. After a short delay of 1 s,\nthe spring blade is released from the electromagnet and the\noscillations are recorded for 30 seconds.\nTo assure conditions of weightlessness, the experiment is\nperformed on a modified Airbus A300 aircraft which has been\nretrofitted for performing parabolic flights. The parabolic\nflight provides a suitable microgravity environment (\u00b10.05 g)\nwhich lasts around 22 s and allows a number of experiments to\nbe performed. In the following section, the numerical model\nand simulation techniques are described.\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL MODEL AND SIMULATION METHOD\n\nA sufficiently complex model, capable of reproducing the\nobserved experimental behavior, must be found if the system's\ndynamics is to be understood. The model presented here is\ncomplex enough to yield quantitative agreement with the experiments and yet simple enough to gain insight into the dynamics of the system. The model for the granulate consists\nof a system of N smooth inelastic hard spheres, each of mass\nm and diameter \u03c3. Although inelastic hard spheres are a basic\nmodel for the granulate they capture all of the essential behavior of the system: dissipative interactions between hard spherical particles. Friction forces, which typically play a large role\nin granular systems, are also neglected and the implications of\nthis approximation are discussed later.\nTo model the oscillating mass and granular damper, the\nhard spheres are shaken in a rectangular box of mass M ,\nwhich is coupled to a linear spring. The box is assumed to\nremain parallel to the axis of the system and oscillate along\nonly one axis. By only permitting oscillations in a single dimension, this model neglects the arcing motion of the blade\nspring (see Fig. 1) and oscillatory modes induced by the collisions of the particles with the box; however, these effects\nare expected to be small in comparison to the dynamics of the\nmodeled oscillation. With these approximations, the collisionfree motion of the box can then be modeled using a simple\n\n\f3\nharmonic oscillator\n(0)\n\n~rBox (t) = n\u0302 \u2206 cos [2 \u03c0 \u03c9 (t + tshift )] + ~rbox\n\n(1)\n\nevent to occur was a collision between this particle and a oscillating wall, the lower bound is increased to avoid re-detecting\nthe same root. The lower bound is then set to\n2 f \u0307(0)\n\n(0)\n\nwhere ~rBox is the current position of the oscillator, ~rBox is its\nequilibrium position, n\u0302 is the unit vector in the direction of\nthe oscillation, and \u03c9 is the frequency of the empty damper.\nThe amplitude of the oscillation \u2206 and the phase shift of the\noscillator tshift are dynamical quantities and are altered by\nparticle-box interactions. At time t = 0, the plate is at its\npositive maximum (tshift = 0) with an initial displacement of\n\u2206 = \u22060 .\nThe methods for performing event-driven simulations using\nsmooth hard-spheres and fixed walls are well established (e.g.,\nsee Ref. [37]) and will not be discussed in detail. Here an\nevent-driven dynamics simulation package (DYNAMO [38]) is\nused to simulate the dynamics of granular-damped oscillators.\nThe only extension to the basic event-driven method concerns\nthe detection and execution of events between particles and\nthe oscillating boundary walls perpendicular to the oscillation\ndirection n\u0302, which is discussed in the following subsections.\n\nA.\n\nDetecting Oscillating Wall Interactions\n\nEvent-driven algorithms require an expression to calculate\nif and when a collision (an event) occurs between a particle\nand the bounding walls of the damper. If a collision is detected\nand it is the next event to occur in the system, the system is\nmoved to the time of the collision and the event is executed by\nupdating the velocities of the colliding particle, and the phase\nshift tshift and amplitude \u2206 of the oscillator.\nTo determine the time at which a particle i will collide with\nan oscillating wall, the equations of motion for the particle\nand the oscillating plate must be solved. Essentially, this is a\nsearch for the shortest positive root \u2206t of the function\n\u0012\n\u0013\nL\u2212\u03c3\nf (\u2206t) = [~ri + \u2206t ~vi \u2212 ~rBox (\u2206t + t)] * n\u0302 \u00b1\n=0\n2\n(2)\nwhere ~ri and ~vi are the position and velocity of particle i at\nthe current system time t, and \u2206t is the time till collision. The\nsign of the term \u00b1(L \u2212 \u03c3)/2 is used to set which side of the\noscillating box is tested for collisions.\nTo guarantee that no roots are missed, the root finding technique of Frenkel and Maguire [39] is used. This root finding\nroutine requires a fixed interval to search for possible roots.\nThe upper bound on the interval to search is determined from\nthe time the freely moving particle takes to cross the extrema\nof the tested-wall's oscillation\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(0)\nsgn(n\u0302 * ~vi ) ([L \u2212 \u03c3] /2 + \u2206) \u2212 n\u0302 * ~ri \u2212 ~rBox\n\u2206tmax =\nn\u0302 * ~vi\n(3)\nwhere sgn(x) is the sign function. The lower bound is typically the current system time (\u2206tmin = 0); however, if the last\n\n\u2206tmin =\n\nf \u0308max\n\n(4)\n\nwhere f \u0308max = \u2206 \u03c9 2 is the maximum absolute second derivative of Eq. (2). The root finding technique used to search\nfor suitable roots of Eq. (2) iterates towards a root from the\nboundaries of the interval by approximating the function at\neach iteration with a parabola. The equation of the parabola is\ngenerated using the derivatives of Eq. (2) and its smallest root\nprovides the next iteration point. The iterations are halted on\nthe nth iteration once the following criterion is met\n|\u2206tn \u2212 \u2206tn\u22121 | <\n\n[L \u2212 \u03c3]\n\u00d7 10\u221212\n2 f \u0307max\n\n(5)\n\nwhere f \u0307max = |~vi * n\u0302|+2 \u03c0 \u03c9 \u2206 is the maximum absolute first\nderivative of Eq. (2). Unlike the hard line system of Frenkel\nand Maguire [39], all roots of Eq. (2) are acceptable and only\nthe earliest root must be found. This completes the description\nof the collision detection and root finding technique.\nB. Executing Particle-Oscillating Wall Collisions\n\nThe final part of the simulation algorithm concerns the execution of oscillating boundary wall collisions. The conservation of momentum and the assumption of a constant coefficient of inelasticity leads to\n\u0010 h\ni\u0011\n\u2206~\npi = \u2212\u2206~\npwall = \u2212\u03bc (1 + \u03b5pw ) n\u0302 * ~vi \u2212 ~r \u0307Box n\u0302 (6)\nwhere \u2206~\npi and \u2206~\npwall are the momentum change of the\ncolliding particle i and oscillating wall respectively, \u03bc =\nm M/(m + M ) is the relative mass, and \u03b5pw is the coefficient\nof inelasticity for particle-wall collisions. During a collision,\nthe phase, tshift , and amplitude, \u2206, of the oscillating wall are\naltered under the constraints of conserving momentum and the\ncurrent box position. This results in the following expressions\nfor the post collision state of the oscillating plate\ni \uf8f6\nh\n\uf8eb\n \u0307Box\n\u2212n\u0302\n*\n\u2206~\np\n+\n~\nr\nBox\n1\nh\ni\uf8f8 \u2212 t\nt\u2032shift = arctan \uf8ed\n(7)\n(0)\n\u03c9\n2 \u03c0 \u03c9 n\u0302 * ~rBox \u2212 ~rBox\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(0)\nn\u0302 * ~rBox \u2212 ~rBox\n(8)\n\u2206\u2032 =\ncos (2 \u03c0 \u03c9 [t + t\u2032shift ])\nwhere the primes denote post-collision values. Care must be\ntaken at this point in the calculation to ensure that the magnitude of t and tshift do not affect the precision of the calculations. Care must be taken also to retain the correct quadrant\nof the calculated angle when using the arctan function.\nA difficulty with the event-driven simulation method arises\nfrom its inability to simulate events with finite durations.\n\n\f4\nWhen the oscillating wall is accelerating, a particle can repeatedly collide with the plate until its relative velocity and\nseparation are numerically zero. Physically, the particle sticks\nto the wall and is pushed until the plate enters the deceleration\nphase of its oscillation, or interacts with another particle. To\nprevent this unresolvable situation from occurring within the\nevent-driven simulation, the interactions between the oscillating wall and a particle are turned elastic when\n\u0011\n\u0010\nn\u0302 * ~vi \u2212 ~r \u0307Box\n< 0.04\n(9)\n\u03c0\u03c9\u2206\nThe pushing of the particle is then transformed into a sequence\nof small hops which, as in the physical pushed case, do not\ndissipate energy. As this expression is linear in the current\ndisplacement \u2206, the long time behavior of the system is still\nrecovered (\u2206 \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e). This elastic approximation\nis small when the plate motion dominates the dynamics of\nthe system and the results appear to be unaffected if smaller\nvalues for Eq. (9) are used.\n\nC. Parameters of the Simulation\n\nThe simulations are initialized with all particles arranged in\na regular lattice (FCC), with initial velocities assigned from\na Gaussian and a total particle energy less than < 0.002% of\nthe initial spring energy. The particles are packed in a loose\nlayer on the wall at the initial extrema of the oscillation. The\nparticles in the experiment are also typically arranged this way\ndue to the influence of gravity before the microgravity phase\nof the experiment.\nThe simulations require several inputs and these parameters are reported in Table I. All parameters, with the exception of the box frequency \u03c9 and inelasticities \u03b5pp and \u03b5pw ,\nare directly obtained from the experimental setup described in\nSec. II. The three remaining parameters must be calculated\nfrom material parameters or obtained through experimental\nresults.\nTABLE I: Model parameters for the event-driven simulations.\n\u03c3 (mm)\n10\n\nm (g)\n4.04\n\nN\n37\n\n\u22060 (mm)\n107.5\n\n\u03c9 (s\u22121 )\n1.23\n\nM (g)\n434\n\n\u03b5pp\n0.75\n\n\u03b5pw\n0.76\n\nThe frequency of the unloaded damper \u03c9 may be estimated\nusing the simple harmonic oscillator model.

In\nthe limit of a large box, the granulate will completely decouple from the oscillator and \u03c9system \u2192 \u03c9. Remarkably, the\nfrequency of the experimental oscillators, obtained through\naveraging the peak and center point frequencies, is consistent for all box lengths at approximately \u03c9system \u2248 1.05 s\u22121\nwith a standard deviation of \u00b10.01 s\u22121 . If its assumed that\n\u03c9system \u2248 \u03c9loaded for small box lengths, Eq. (12) estimates an\nunloaded frequency of \u03c9 \u2248 1.22 \u00b1 0.1 s\u22121 for the experimental system. This agreement with the beam equation is promising and suggests that, although the granulate is periodically\ndecoupled from the oscillator, the deviation from Eq. (12) is\nstill small for the experimental box lengths studied here. For\nthe simulations, a slightly higher frequency of \u03c9 \u2248 1.23 s\u22121\nis used which is within the standard deviation of the experimental values and yields an excellent fit to the experimental\ndata.\nFinally, the coefficients of restitution \u03b5pp and \u03b5pw describing the inelastic collisions between particles and between a\nparticle and the wall must be determined. These model parameters are obtained by fitting simulation results to the experimental data for the smallest box length (L = 40 mm, Fig. 2).\nAs best fits the following results are obtained\n\u03b5pp = 0.75\n\n\u03b5pw = 0.76\n\n(13)\n\nThe value for the particle-wall coefficient of restitution is in\nclose agreement with published results reported for a 9.35mm\nsteel ball-bearing impacting a clamped acrylic plate [40];\nhowever, the particle-particle inelastic coefficient is significantly lower than expected. Performing an automated drop\ntest [41] of the granulate on to a silicon carbide plate yields\nan elasticity of \u03b5 \u2248 0.95. Due to the high rigidity of the base\nplate, this value should be close to the experimental value for\nparticle-particle interactions. The fitted particle-particle inelasticity \u03b5pp may be unexpectedly lower than the drop test\nresults due to missing dissipation mechanisms in the model\n(e.g., granulate friction). Despite this, the agreement of the\nsimulation and experimental results (see Sec. III D) shows that\nthis is still an effective model for the system.\nIt should be noted that the optimization/fitting of the inelasticities \u03b5pp and \u03b5pw is performed exclusively for the box\n\n\f5\n\nThe simulation and experimental results are compared in\nthis section to validate the model. Figure 2 presents the box\nposition xBox and granulate center of mass xCOM as a function of time for a box length of L = 40 mm. Two experimental measurements are reported and both are in close agreement\nwith the simulation results. The experimental and simulation\nresults display a high degree of repeatability and single realizations are representative of the averaged values. This is due\nto the uniqueness of the initial state, with the spring held in a\ndeflected state and the particles resting in a regular, repeatable\nlayer on the outer wall due to the influence of gravity before\nthe microgravity phase.

The area of the visible particles are identified and the\ncentroid location is taken to be the center of mass. Due to\nthe end walls and slight arcing motion of the box (see Fig. 1)\nthe reconstructed center of mass is slightly biased towards the\ncenter of the box.\nThe agreement between the simulation and experiment for\nthe frequency of the damped oscillator is excellent and confirms the accuracy of the fundamental frequency \u03c9; however,\n\n10\n\n5\n\n-5\n\nxCOM (cm)\n\nxBox (cm)\n\n10\n\n-10\n15\n\nt (s)\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) The same comparison as Fig. 3, but for a box\nlength of L = 85 mm.\n\nIn general, the simulation results are in excellent agreement\nwith the models predictions.

Overall, the fitting of the inelasticities appears to be effective at capturing the behavior of the system and no further\nparameters or extensions of the simulation model are required.\nThe most striking feature of the curves in Figs. 2-5 is the\nlinear decay of the peak amplitude of the oscillation with time.\nA detailed discussion of this property is postponed to Sec. V\nand optimal dampers are discussed in the following section.\n\nIV.\n\nOPTIMAL DAMPERS\n\nThere is a significant dependence of the damping efficiency\non the container length, as is seen in Figs. 2\u20135. The number\nof cycles before the oscillations are sufficiently damped varies\nfrom 13 to 4 as the box length is increased. By examining the\nenergy transfer mechanisms within the granular damper, an\nexpression for optimizing the dampers design may be found.\nFigure 6 plots the cumulative energy lost through the three\nclasses of collisions in the simulation system. It should be\nnoted that Fig. 6 is only valid for the fitted inelasticities and\nwill therefore differ from the true experimental values. Nevertheless, the results should agree qualitatively and allow some\ninsight into the experimental system. The sides of the box appear to be unimportant in this design of a damper and may\npresent an opportunity for optimization by utilizing alternative shaker geometries (e.g., an hourglass design). Not only\nare the particle-end wall collisions the sole mechanism for\nthe transferal of oscillation energy from the oscillator into the\ncontained granulate, but simulation results estimate that these\ncollisions are also a significant dissipation mechanism for the\ndamper. The end wall interactions both transfer and dissipate\nthe maximum energy when the relative velocity of the oscillator end walls and granulate are maximized. Therefore, maximizing this relative speed should optimize the performance of\nthe granular damper.

Theoretical Predictions\n\nAttempting to optimize the system by modeling the granulate as a single particle or some other simplified description\nis difficult [43] due to the lack of an analytical solution to\nEq. (2). To estimate the optimal damping conditions, only\ntwo plausible assumptions for the motion of the granulate in\nthe box are required: a) the granulate will be \"collected\" and\nform a packed layer on the approaching oscillating wall during the initial inward stroke (when the oscillator accelerates\ntowards the center point), and b) the center of mass velocity\nof the granulate at the end of the inward stroke is, on average,\nthe maximum oscillator velocity. The time from the center of\nthe stroke at which the granulate would hit the peak displacement of the oscillator is then given by\ntg,peak =\n\nL + \u2206 \u2212 \u03c3layer\n2 \u03c0 \u03c9loaded \u2206\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03c3layer = 20 mm is the thickness of the layer of granulate when it is packed on the surface of the oscillating wall.\nIt should be noted that Eq. (14) decreases in time, as \u2206 decreases on average due to interactions with the granulate. If\nfor any integer n the peak collision time lies in the range\nn < \u03c9 tg,peak < n + 1/4, the granulate will hit the oscillating wall on the outward phase of its stroke. All experimental\nbox with the exception of the largest system (L = 104 mm)\nare within this regime. It is expected that improved damping\noccurs if the granulate hits on the inward stroke as the relative\nvelocity is maximized.\nThe granulate travels the length of the box in\ntg,Box =\n\nL \u2212 \u03c3layer\n2 \u03c0 \u03c9loaded \u2206\n\n(15)\n\nIf n+ 1/4 > \u03c9 tg,peak > n+ 1 and n < \u03c9 tg,Box < n+ 1/2, the\ngranulate will collide on the inward phase of the stroke. The\nlargest system, where \u03c9 tg,Box \u2248 0.15, collides after the turning point of the oscillator; however, the dissipation is maximized when \u03c9 tg,Box \u2248 1/2. At this point, the relative velocity\n\n\fThis expression is remarkable in that it is independent of the\noscillation frequency. This may be understood from dimensional analysis as, due to the negligible initial kinetic energy,\nthe model has only one time scale. As such, the solutions to\nthe model must scale trivially in the frequency of the oscillations. In the following subsection, the results of Eq. (16) and\nits assumptions are checked against simulation results.\nB. Numerical Test\n\nThe validity of the basic assumptions made in Sec. IV A\nand the result, Eq. (16), are now tested using the results of\nthe DEM simulations. Using Eq. (16) to predict the optimal\nbox length for the damping of the experimental system yields\na value of Lopt = 311 mm. The results of a simulation at this\nbox length are presented in Fig. 7. A square step in the granulate center of mass velocity is visible at the peak of the box\nvelocity as the granulate decouples from the oscillator. The\nassumption of an equal box and granulate velocity at the midpoint of the stroke (at peak velocity) appears to hold. Visual\ninspection [44] confirms the granulate is collected in a layer\non the approaching oscillating wall. The re-collision of the\ngranulate also appears to occur close to the peak of the box\nvelocity, maximizing the relative velocity, energy dissipation,\nand energy transfer in this first collision. The largest oscillations are effectively damped within one second; however, the\noscillator is now susceptible to smaller amplitude oscillations\nwhich appear to decay very slowly. The optimal approach\nwould be to couple two or more dampers to damp a wider\nrange of amplitudes within short timescales. This idea has already been pursued for impact dampers (e.g., Ref. [45]) which\nare related to granular dampers except that in the container or\ncavity there is only a single particle.\nTo test the predictions of Eq. (16) for the optimal damping\nlength L, a suitable metric must be defined to compare various\nbox lengths. Figure 8 compares the time an oscillator takes to\ndissipate a certain fraction of the initial energy as a function of\nthe box length. Despite the continuing low-amplitude oscillations of the damper at L = 311 mm (see Fig. 7), the damper\neffectively eliminates 95% of the initial energy in well under\ntwo oscillations. Equation (16) appears to yield an excellent\nestimate for the global optimal box length, avoiding both the\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n\nBox\nGranulate COM\nFriction Model\n\na)\n\nv (cm / s)\n\n50\n0\n-50\n\nb)\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n6\n\n10\n\nt (s)\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) A comparison of simulation results, experimental data and Eq.

This is highlighted in Fig. 9, where the\ntime dependence of the square root of the total energy of the\ndamper is plotted. This result is surprising considering the approximations of the previous section: the oscillator appears to\nhave a constant frequency for a given box length, and the oscillator collects the granulate on a wall and then collides the\ngranulate in each half period. For the amplitude decay to be\nlinear, the energy dissipated in each of these \"collisions\" of the\n\n\f8\ngranulate must then be proportional to the amplitude \u2206. However, if an inelastic particle is given a velocity proportional to\nthe maximum plate velocity (2 \u03c0 \u03c9 \u2206), it will dissipate energy\nproportional to the square of the plate amplitude (\u22062 ) for a\ngiven number of collisions.\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nEtotal (J )\n\n0.40\n0.30\n0.20\n0.10\n0.00\n0\n\n104mm\n\n85mm\n\n65mm\n\n40mm\n\n10\n\n5\n\n15\n\nt (s)\n\nFIG. 9: (Color online) Total energies of the oscillators as obtained\nfrom numerical simulations.\n\nThe result is also surprising as the more common viscous\ndampers yield an exponential decay of the amplitude; however, the only simple damped-oscillator which displays a linear decay in the amplitude is one damped by a constant magnitude force [46] (e.g., a friction-damped oscillator). The equation of motion for such an oscillator is\nMtot \u1e8d = \u2212k x \u2212 \u03bc Mtot sgn (\u1e8b)\n\n(17)\n\nwhere x is the oscillator position, Mtot = M + N m is the\ntotal oscillating mass and \u03bc Mtot is the magnitude of the constant frictional force. No simple analytical solution exists to\nthis equation although piecewise solutions may be found [46].\nThis model does not appear to be appropriate for the granular damper due to the intermittent nature of the damping\nforce. For example, the steps in the damper energy (Fig. 9)\narise from the decoupling of the damping granulate and oscillator at the midpoint of the stroke (see Fig. 7) and during these\nsteps the oscillator experiences no damping force. However,\nthis model may still be useful in characterizing and comparing\nthe damping efficiencies of granular dampers in microgravity\nthrough the effective frictional force \u03bc Mtot .\nThe effective frictional force of a experimental damper may\nbe estimated through the decay of the peak amplitude, as given\nby\n\u03bc Mtot =\n\nk (\u22060 \u2212 |xn |)\n2 n + 1 \u2212 (\u22121)2 n\n\n(18)\n\nwhere n is the index of the amplitude peak and |xn | is the\nabsolute oscillator displacement for the nth peak. The peak\nnumber n, used to calculate the effective friction coefficient,\nshould be odd to only sample the amplitude during the \"collection\" phase of the oscillation and should be as small as possible for correct measurement of rapid dampers. The earliest\nvalue of n which satisfies these requirements is n = 3, at a\ntime of t = 1.5/\u03c9system. Equation (18) is used to extract an\neffective friction force for each experimental system and the\ncorresponding solutions to Eq. (17) are plotted in Figs. 2\u20135.\nFor the non-optimal dampers the model fits the data well. Deviations begin to appear towards the end of the oscillations as\nthe \"collect and collide\" motion begins to break down and the\n\ngranulate spreads uniformly over the box. This lends weight\nto the argument that the \"collect and collide\" motion of the\ngranulate is responsible for the apparent friction-damped behavior. For the optimal damper (see Fig. 7), the model does\nnot fit as well. The discrepancy arises from the oscillators frequency for this box length being significantly different from\nthe predictions of Eq. 12. Simple spring models will no longer\nwork and appear to be constrained to the range (tg,peak . 1/4).\nA better fit may be obtained by fitting the spring coefficient k,\nhowever this is unsatisfactory as the results of the model cannot be compared between systems. Another deficiency of the\nfriction model is that it predicts that the damper will come to\na complete halt after a finite time. It fails to capture the persistent small amplitude oscillations (see Fig. 7). The friction\ndeceleration, \u03bc, still appears to be a useful value for comparing the damping efficiency of sub-optimal granular dampers.\nThe quadratic decay of energy with time in a granular\nsystem attached to a linear spring has been reported before [7, 23, 24, 47]. Surprisingly, the same behavior is found\nalso for rather different dampers such as thrust-based damping [48] and impact dampers [49\u201352]. However, this is not a\ngeneral rule and other published results exist (e.g., Ref. [5])\nwhere a non-linear decay of the amplitude of the oscillation\n(possibly exponential) is found. This work clarifies that this\napparent frictional behavior may also arise solely from the\ncollisional granular dynamics and does not necessarily arise\nfrom friction forces within the experimental setup. This is evident as the simple model used in the simulations reproduces\nthe linear decay of the amplitude.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, a method for performing controlled experiments on granular damped oscillators in microgravity is outlined. High-speed video capture and image-processing techniques are used to reconstruct the motion of the oscillator to\nobtain accurate experimental results. A simple hard sphere\nmodel and event-driven dynamics are also used to generate\nquantitative results that compare well against the experimental values. From the excellent agreement of the simulation and\nexperimental frequency, it appears that the damper frequency\nresponds like a simple harmonic oscillator to changes in load\n(Eq. (12)) for short box lengths. This is remarkable given the\nperiodic decoupling of the granulate from the spring and box.\nThe simulation model scales trivially with the frequency of\nthe oscillations as, apart from the negligible initial energy, the\nmodel has only one time scale. Further research is required on\nexperimental systems to determine the frequency dependence\nof granular dampers and generalize the current model to these\nsystems.\nThe straightforward design of these granular dampers\nyields a remarkably simple expression for the optimal damping configuration of the form of Eq. (16). Simulations at\nthe predicted optimal box length damp large amplitude oscillations remarkably well (see Fig. 7) but are susceptible to\nsmaller amplitude disturbances. The final expression for the\noptimal box length is independent of the oscillation frequency,\n\n\f9\nwhich may be understood through dimensional analysis of the\nmodel.\nUnlike conventional viscous-damped systems, the granular damped system studied here displays a linear decay in the\namplitude. This behavior is not intuitive and is a feature typical of friction-damped oscillators. The simulation results and\ntheir excellent agreement with experimental results strongly\nsuggest that this effect arises solely from the granular dynamics. The linear decay is a useful property as it implies that\na granular damper can completely damp oscillations within\na finite time; however, this is not the case as, at low oscillation energies a transition occurs and the damping force is significantly reduced. Further research is required in designing\ndampers with a wider amplitude response by coupling multiple dampers with different lengths. The internal geometries\n\nmay also be optimized to eliminate the decoupling of the granulate in the midpoint of the stroke to create more effective\ndampers.\n\n[1] C. Saluena, T.
