Introduction\nFollowing the 1930 pioneering work of Rosenfeld [1], all attempts to combine\nEinstein's general relativity (EGR) and quantum mechanics into a theory of quantum\ngravity (QG) over the past seven decades have been futile -- leading to discrepancies\nand even contradictions.\n\nA theory of QG may have far-reaching astrophysical\n\nimplications. Quantum gravity could shed light on the big bang and the early universe.\nQG may also determine fundamental physical attributes that start on a small scale and\naffect large scale astrophysical properties. So it is important to explore a potential\nincompatibility. First let us examine the weak and the strong forms of the equivalence\nprinciple. It will be shown that the weak equivalence principle is clearly violated by\nquantum mechanics. The violation of the strong equivalence principle by quantum\nmechanics is more subtle, being difficult to show directly. However, it will be clearly\nshown that a violation of the weak equivalence principle implies a violation of the\nstrong equivalence principle upon which EGR is based.\n\n-1-\n\n\f2. Quantum Mechanics Clearly Violates the Weak Equivalence Principle\nThe weak equivalence principle (WEP) states that there are no physical effects\nthat depend on the mass of a point particle in an external gravitational field. This is\nrelated to the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass which permits cancellation\nof the particle's mass in Newtonian physics. Thus the same trajectory is followed by\nparticles of different mass if they have the same initial conditions.\nHowever this does not occur in quantum mechanics. For a particle of inertial\nmass mi and gravitational mass mg , falling directly toward mass M where M >> m, the\nSchroedinger equation is\n\nGmg M\n\u2212h2 2\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2207 \u03a8\u2212\n\u03a8 = ih\n.\n2mi\nr\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nEven for m i = m g , the mass does not cancel out of the equations of motion, as can be\nseen more transparently from eq. (2) since m appears in the denominator of the kinetic\nenergy term and the numerator of the potential energy term of the Hamiltonian. This is\nmore apparent for m i = m g \u2261 m , in a uniform gravitational field in the x direction, of\nacceleration g:\n\u2212h \u2202\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u03a8 + mgx \u03a8 = ih\n.\n2\n2m \u2202x\n\u2202t\n2\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\nIn examining the possibility of gravitationally bound atoms in 3-space [2] and\nlater in n-space [3, 4] it was clear to me that m remains in the quantized equations of\nmotion, even for M >> m; though m cancels out of the classical equations of motion in\nNewtonian gravity. One would expect m to cancel out when averaging over states with\nlarge quantum numbers that puts them effectively in the classical continuum.\nIn quantum mechanics, the wavelength is inversely proportional to the\nmomentum and hence involves the mass. Quantum mechanical interference effects in\ngeneral, and quantum-gravitational interference effects in particular, depend on the\nphase and phase shifts which depend on the momentum and hence are proportional to\nthe mass. For example for low energy, the phase shift \u03b4 o \u221d (k) = (p/ h) = mv/ h. This is\n\n-2-\n\n\fintrinsic to quantum mechanics. The uncertainty principle is basically related to the\ndestruction of phase relations in different parts of the wave function.\n\nThe weak\n\nequivalence principle requires that the equations of motion be independent of m.\nEven though the WEP and the SEP work well independently of QM, this is not the case\nin the union of general relativity and quantum mechanics (quantum gravity).\n3. Quantum Mechanics Violates the Strong Equivalence Principle\nEinstein postulated the strong equivalence principle (SEP) to formulate general\nrelativity.\n\nThe SEP states that locally, gravitation is indistinguishable from an\n\nequivalently accelerating reference frame. This implies the WEP since the accelerating\nreference frame is independent of the mass acted upon by the gravitational field.\nFurthermore, the SEP implies that it is possible to locally transform away gravitational\neffects in a properly chosen reference frame.\nIn the spirit of the SEP by transformation to an accelerated reference frame of\nacceleration -g, with coordinates x a in the Schroedinger equation (2), the transformed\ncoordinates\nx a = x \u2212 vt \u2212 12 gt 2 and t = t a\n\n(3)\n\ndo not involve the mass m. So m doesn't cancel out, and now both the WEP and the\nSEP are violated in this case. The violation of the WEP may be less manifest in the\nHeisenberg matrix quantum mechanics approach, say for example if the QM operator\nfor a particle in a gravitational field were independent of mass. Nevertheless the\nequations of motion would be mass dependent as the Heisenberg and Schroedinger\napproaches have been shown to be equivalent. We will soon see that quantum\nmechanics violates the WEP and the SEP quite generally.\nIn examining the possible violation of the SEP by quantum mechanics [4],\nvarying modifications of Einstein's SEP were presented.\n\nOne of these is that of\n\nRohrlich. Interestingly, Rohrlich [5] doesn't use the terms WEP and SEP, and just refers\nto the equivalence principle (EP). Rohrlich's general statement of EP says that the\nequations of motion of a nonrotating test body in free fall in a gravitational field are\n\n-3-\n\n\findependent of the energy content of that body. He appears to diminish the role of SEP\nin saying (p.42): \"True gravitational fields can never be transformed away. ... Apparent\ngravitational fields are a characteristic of the motion of the observer (rather than of the\nobserved physical system), while true gravitational fields\nobservers no matter what their motion.\n\nare the same for all\n\n... Einstein's statement [of the EP] as an\n\nequivalence between accelerated observers and gravitational fields is now seen to be\nrestricted to apparent gravitational fields.\n\nTrue gravitational fields cannot be\n\nsimulated by acceleration (i.e. by a coordinate transformation).\" In my mind, this raises\na serious question as to whether \"apparent gravitation\" and \"space-time\" are\nphysically synonymous, though they appear to be in EGR. Clearly, the EP does not\nincorporate spin in general and particle spin in particular. Thus it should not be\nsurprising if the Sagnac [6] effect cannot be properly accounted for within the context of\nEGR [7].\nThe different statements of the equivalence principle are interrelated. If the\nequations of motion involve the mass, m, not only is WEP violated but this also\ninvolves a violation of SEP [4].\nIt is clear that SEP \u21d2 WEP since SEP yields equations of motion of a body\nindependent of its mass in a gravitational field. A general principle in logic is:\nIf A \u21d2 B then (not B) \u21d2 (not A).\n\n(4)\n\nSince SEP \u21d2 WEP, then (not WEP) \u21d2 (not SEP).\n\n(5)\n\nTherefore quantum mechanics violates the SEP because it violates the WEP.\n4. Semi-Classical Mechanics Violates the Weak Equivalence Principle\nIt may not be obvious that the semi-classical Bohr-Sommerfeld condition\n\n\u222b p \u22c5 dl = \u222b mv \u22c5 dl = jh violates the WEP.\n\nNevertheless, its predictions for the equations\n\nof motion for a particle in a gravitational field clearly do so. We will see that they do so\nin all dimensions of space.\n4.1 Three Dimensional Space\n\n-4-\n\n\fBecause of the closer proximity and similarity of semi-classical mechanics to\nclassical mechanics, one might think that its violation of the equivalence principle may\nnot be as manifest as that of quantum mechanics. As we shall see, this is not the case.\nFor a two-body system of masses m << M, the velocity of the orbiting body m is\n2\n2\n\uf8eb GM \uf8f6\nGmM \u03bcv\nmv\n=\n\u2248\n\u21d2\nv\n=\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 ,\nr2\nr\nr\n\uf8ed r \uf8f8\n1/ 2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere circular motion is considered for simplicity, and the reduced mass\n\u03bc=\n\nmM\n\u2248 m for M>>m. The Bohr-Sommerfeld condition for the angular momentum\nm+M\n\nleads to\n\uf8eb GM \uf8f6\nm( v)r = m \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed r \uf8f8\n\n1/ 2\n\nr = jh , where j is an integer.\n\n(7)\n\nEquation (7) implies that the orbital radius is\nr=\n\n2\n\n2\n\nj h\n.\nGMm 2\n\n(8)\n\nSubstituting eq. (8) into eq. (6) we obtain the velocity\nv = GMm / jh .\n\n(9)\n\nand the acceleration is\na \u2261 v 2 / r = \u2212G3 M 3m 4 /( jh)4 .\n\n(10)\n\nThese all have a mass dependence, m, which is not present in their classical\ncounterparts.\n4.2 n- Dimensional Space\nSometimes one encounters surprises in higher n-dimensional space [3, 4]:\nAngular momentum cannot be quantized in the usual manner in four dimensional\nspace. This is because the dependence of angular momentum, L, on rn allows the\norbital radius to adjust in the quantization of L in all dimensions except in 4-space.\nThere is no binding energy for atoms for = 4-space because the binding energy = 0 for n\n= 4, and the energy levels are all > 0 for n > 4. The macroscopic dimensionality of\nspace can be determined by measuring the temperature dependence of black body\n\n-5-\n\n\fradiation because the temperature exponent = n + 1. The volume of a radius r, infinite\ndimensional sphere = 0 because the n-volume of an n-sphere relative to an n-cube of\nside = r, peaks \u2248 5-dimensional space. Thereafter for large n, the ratio of the n-sphere\nvolume to the n-cube volume is a quickly diminishing fraction which \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e. So\nit is important to look at higher dimensions in case one might encounter a surprise with\nrespect to the WEP.\nHowever, it is easy to demonstrate that semi-classical mechanics violates the\nWEP in n-dimensional space. Because of the correspondence of the m dependence in\nquantum mechanics, QM violates the WEP in n-space. We can directly obtain the\nhigher dimensional results for circular orbits directly from [3, 4]:\nFor M >> m , equating the gravitational force and the centripetal force\n\n\uf8ebn\uf8f6\n\u22122\u03c0Gn Mm \u0393\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed 2 \uf8f8 \u2212mv 2n\nFn =\n=\n,\n\u03c0 n/ 2r n\u22121\nrn\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the n-space universal gravitational constant Gn changes, in a way that is model\ndependent, from its 3-space value.

(10).\nIt is clear that the acceleration, the orbital radius, and orbital velocity are all\nfunctions of the mass m in all dimensions as a result of quantization. The\npresence of m is not an artifact of the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition. The same mass\ndependency and basically the same results are obtained from the Schroedinger\nequation. (The Hamiltonian for the attractive gravitational potential is of the same\nform as that of the hydrogen atom with radial wave function solutions in terms of\nLaguerre polynomials. In a one dimensional uniform gravitational potential, the\nSchroedinger equation can be solved in terms of Airy functions, Bessel functions\nof order 1/3, or equivalently MacDonald functions.) The failure of m to vanish\nindicates that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with the weak equivalence\nprinciple [2, 3].\nThe above results indicate that quantum mechanics also violates the WEP in\nhigher dimensional n-space. By the same principle of logic used in Sec. 3, one may\nconclude that the violation of WEP in n-space implies the violation of SEP in n-space.\nThus quantum mechanics violates the SEP in all space and is incompatible with\nEinstein's general relativity in all space. It is noteworthy that these semi-classical\nresults for gravitational orbits do not approach the classical results as j \u2192 \u221e or as\n\nh \u2192 0 , whereas the quantum mechanical results may have the ability to do so because\nof additional degrees of freedom in combining wave functions.\n5. Klein-Gordon and Dirac Relativistic Quantum Mechanics Violate the WEP\nThe special relativity Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations reduce to the\nSchroedinger equation in the non-relativistic limit, so their predictions must agree with it\n\n-7-\n\n\fin this limit. Thus in the non-relativistic limit, they must give equations of motion that\nare a function of the particle mass m in a gravitational field, and hence violate the WEP.\nThe SEP for a non-uniform gravitational field applies at a point, or at best in a\nvery small localized region of space. Therefore in general, the SEP is precluded from\napplying to QM which is inherently non-local. Since the WEP does not require locality,\nlet us examine these relativistic quantum equations for a free particle to ascertain if\nthey can escape violation of the WEP when a gravitational field is included in the\nHamiltonian.\n\nFurthermore, a question may be raised about a potential energy\n\nrepresentation of gravity since gravity is just space-time curvature in EGR. We avoid\nthe unnecessary complications of a proper depiction of the gravitational source (which\nin the case of EGR is an energy-momentum tensor that is typically taken to be a\nkinematic perfect fluid) by considering the free-particle equations.\nThe Schroedinger equation is inherently not relativistic because it doesn't treat\nspace and time on an equal footing. Its space derivatives are second order and its time\nderivative is first order.\n\nDirac circumvented this dilema by modifying the\n\nHamiltonian so that it would be linear in the space derivatives. Thus the Dirac equation\nfor a free mass, m, is\n\uf8ee \u2202\n2\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 ih \u2202t \u2212 ihc\u03b1 \u22c5 \u2207 + \u03b2mc \uf8fa\uf8fb\u03a8 = 0 , where\n\n(15)\n\nthe components of the vector \u03b1 , and the scalar \u03b2 are Dirac matrices. \u03a8 is a fourcomponent spinor field. (Incidently, although the Dirac equation is only for special\nrelativity, spinors were discovered by Cartan while working on general relativity.) The\nmatrices \u03b1 and \u03b2 are independent of m, as are the first two terms, and \u03b2mc 2 \u03a8 is the\nonly mass term. If one could introduce a special relativistic gravitational potential\nenergy term in the Hamiltonian, it would be proportional to m, and m would not cancel\nout.\n\nTherefore the Dirac equation violates the WEP, implying that it also violates the\n\nSEP by the logic of eq. (5), as well as due to non-locality.\nThe Klein-Gordon equation for a free mass, m, is\n\n[h \u2202t\u2202\n2\n\n2\n2\n\n]\n\n\u2212 h2c2 \u2207 2 + m 2c 4 \u03a8 = 0.\n\n(16)\n\n-8-\n\n\fIn addition to a second-order time derivative and a second-order space derivative, the\nKlein-Gordon equation has a term m 2c 4 \u03a8 which is the only mass term. If one could\nintroduce a special relativistic gravitational potential energy term in the Hamiltonian, it\nwould be proportional to m, and m would not cancel out. Therefore the Klein-Gordon\nequation violates the WEP, implying that it also violates the SEP by the logic of eq. (5),\nas well as due to non-locality.\n6. Discussion\nTo my knowledge, my approach to the problem preventing the development of\na theory of quantum gravity is original and differs from that of others. The only other\npaper that I was able to find which comes to the same conclusion as mine is that of\nLoinger [8]. However, he takes a different approach in reaching his conclusion. One\ndifficulty that has been previously examined is the different role that time plays in\nEinstein's general relativity compared with quantum mechanics. Time is an external\nscalar parameter in quantum mechanics. In EGR time is part of space-time, and hence\nis an internal dynamical quantity. It is difficult to reconcile the two concepts. Unruh\n[9] aptly discusses this in his treatise on \"Time, Gravity, and Quantum Mechanics\".\nHerdegen and Wawrzycki [10] in their paper, \"Is Einstein's equivalence principle valid for a\nquantum particle?\" conclude that the EP and quantum mechanics are compatible. Davies\n[11] discusses tunneling anomalies related to \"Quantum mechanics and the equivalence\nprinciple.\" Although he finds that QM violates the WEP, he does not seem to find an\nincompatibility between quantum mechanics and the SEP.\n7. Conclusion\nQuantum mechanics clearly violates the WEP, and logic shows that a violation of\nthe WEP implies a violation of the SEP. This is the case for n-dimensional space, as well\nas for non-relativistic and relativistic QM. Therefore to achieve a consistent theory of\nquantum gravity, it must not be based upon the prevailing equivalence principle. Or\nquantum mechanics must change a body's mass dependence (e.g. involving the test mass\n\n-9-\n\n\fat high energy and having it cancel out at low energy) in the equations of motion of that\nbody in a gravitational field. Neither of these seems likely at the present time\nReferences\n[1] L. Rosenfeld, Ann. Der Physik 5, 113 (1930).\n[2] M. Rabinowitz, IEEE Power Engineering Review 10, No. 4, 27 (1990).\n[3] M.
