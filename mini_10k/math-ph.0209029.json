It is proved that under rather general\nassumption on the Hamiltonian describing the system, in the adiabatic limit, the\ncurrent through the pump is given by a formula of B\u00fcttiker, Pr\u00eatre, and Thomas,\nrelating it to the frozen S-matrix and its time derivative.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nTransport in quantum pumps has been investigated in relation to various properties and\nfrom many perspectives [8, 7, 1, 23, 15, 18]. The goal of this article is to provide a rigorous\nsetting for a single but important aspect of these devices, namely the charge transport\nor, more precisely, its expectation value. The idealized setting is as follows: a pump,\nwhose internal configuration varies slowly in time in a prescribed manner, is connected\nto n leads, or channels, along each of which independent electrons can enter or leave\nthe pump. We assume that the electron in the lead has no transverse or spin degrees of\nfreedom and may be thought of as a (non-relativistic) particle moving on a half line1 . The\nincoming electron distribution, at zero temperature, is a Fermi sea with Fermi energy \u03bc\ncommon to all leads. As a rule, this does not apply to the distribution of the outgoing\nelectrons, as their energies may have been shifted while scattering at the pump. Because\nof this imbalance a net current is flowing in the leads. The expected charge transport is\nexpressed by the formula [8, 7]\ne\n(\u0131(dS)S \u2217)jj .\n(1.1)\ndQj =\n2\u03c0\n1\n\nSuch extra degrees of freedom can be represented by adding channels. In general, the different\nchannels may then have different propagation speeds.\n\n1\n\n\fHere S = (Sij ) is the n \u00d7 n scattering matrix at energy \u03bc computed as if the pump were\nfrozen into its instantaneous configuration. A change of the configuration is accompanied\nby a change S \u2192 S + dS of the scattering matrix and by a net charge dQj leaving the\npump through lead j. Finally e is the electron charge, which is henceforth set equal to 1.\nWe shall next present a mathematical framework in which (1.1) can be phrased as a\ntheorem.\n\u2022 The single-particle Hilbert space is given as\nH = H0 \u2295 L2 (R+ , Cn ) ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere states in L2 (R+ , Cn ) = \u2295nj=1 L2 (R+ ), resp. in H0 , describe an electron in one\nof the leads j = 1, . . . . n, resp. in the pump proper. The latter Hilbert space is not\nfurther specified, but the hypothesis A2 below confers on the pump the role of an\nabstract finite box [25]. Let \u03a0j : H \u2192 H denote the projection onto H0 for j = 0 and\non j-th copy of L2 (R+ ) for j = 1. . . . n.\n\u2022 Since the pump configuration is supposed to change slowly in time t, we will eventually\nconsider the evolution of the electrons in an adiabatic limit, where s = \u03b5t is kept fixed\nas \u03b5 > 0 tends to 0. In terms of the rescaled time coordinate s, called epoch, the\npropagator U\u03b5 (s, s\u2032 ) on H satisfies the non-autonomous Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u0131\u2202s U\u03b5 (s, s\u2032 ) = \u03b5\u22121 H(s)U\u03b5 (s, s\u2032 ) ,\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere H(s) is a family of self-adjoint Hamiltonians on H enjoying the following properties:\n(A1)\n(A2)\n(A3)\n(A4)\n(A5)\n\nH(s) \u2212 H(s\u2032 ) is bounded and smooth in s ,\nk(H(s) + \u0131)\u2212m \u03a00 k1 < C for all s and some m \u2208 N\nH(s)\u03c8 = \u2212d2 \u03c8/dx2 for \u03c8 \u2208 C0\u221e (R+ , Cn ) ,\n\u03c3pp (H(s)) \u2229 (0, \u221e) = \u2205 ,\nH(s) = H\u2212 for s \u2264 0 .\n\nHere k*k1 denotes the trace class norm over H, while the operator norm will be written\nas k*k. Assumption A3 states that a particle in the leads is free; in particular, together\nwith A1, it implies that changes in the Hamiltonian are confined to the pump proper:\nH(s) \u2212 H(s\u2032 ) = (H(s) \u2212 H(s\u2032 ))\u03a00 .\n\n(1.4)\n\nAssumption A4 requires that there are no positive embedded eigenvalues; A5 states\nthat the pump is at rest for s \u2264 0.\n\u2022 The initial state of the electrons should be an equilibrium state. This is achieved\nthanks to Assumption A5 by positing that the 1-particle density matrix at some (and\nhence any) epoch s\u2212 < 0 is of the form \u03c1(H\u2212 ), where \u03c1(\u03bb) is a function of bounded\nvariation with supp d\u03c1 \u2282 (0, \u221e). A good example is the Fermi sea, where \u03c1(\u03bb) =\n\u03b8(E \u2212 \u03bb). The time evolution then acts as\n\u03c1(H\u2212 ) 7\u2192 U\u03b5 (s, s\u2212 )\u03c1(H\u2212 )U\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s) .\n2\n\n(1.5)\n\n\f\u2022 We define a generator of exterior scaling w.r.t. (1.2) by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\nd\n1\n,\nv(x) + v(x)\nA=0\u2295\n2\u0131 dx\ndx\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhere v(x) : [0, \u221e) \u2192 R is smooth with v(x) = 0, resp. = x for small, resp. large\nx, and v \u2032 (x) \u2265 0 everywhere. We note that A = A\u2217 commutes with \u03a0j , and set\nAj = A\u03a0j . The operator A distinguishes between incoming and outgoing states,\nrespectively associated with spectral subspaces A < \u2212a and A > a with some large\na > 0. Detection of a particle, and hence of its charge, deep inside lead j may be\nrealized as the operator Qj (a) = f (Aj \u2212 a) + f (\u2212Aj \u2212 a), where f \u2208 C \u221e (R) is a\nswitch function: f (\u03b1) = 0 for \u03b1 < \u22121, resp. = 1 for \u03b1 > 1. The current operator then\nconsistently is\nIj (a) = \u0131[H(s), f (Aj \u2212 a) + f (\u2212Aj \u2212 a)] =: Ij+ (a) + Ij\u2212 (a) .\n\n(1.7)\n\n(In what follows we shall sometimes suppress the index j for the sake of notational\nsimplicity). One feature of this choice of current operator is that the \"ammeter\"\nis located not at a fixed distance from the pump, but rather at a fixed number of\nwavelengths, a, from it: The longer the wavelength the more distant the \"ammeter\".\nIn the case that one focuses on a narrow energy interval, say near the Fermi energy,\nthe \"ammeter\" is also at essentially fixed distance from the pump.\nWe remark that by the support property of v and by A3, the above commutator does\nnot depend on s. The expectation value of the current at epoch s, i.e., in the state\n(1.5), is then given as\n\u0001\nhIij (s, a, \u03b5) = tr U\u03b5 (s, s\u2212 )\u03c1(H\u2212 )U\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s)Ij (a) .\n(1.8)\nIn contrast to Qj (a), which clearly has an infinite expectation value in that state, Ij (a) is\ninclined to have a finite one. Moreover, it should behave as \u03b5 if, in accordance with (1.1),\nthe charge dQj transferred during ds = \u03b5\u22121 dt is to have a non trivial limit as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nOther realizations of the current operator are possible2 , such as \u0131[H(s), f (xj \u2212 a)], or\nthe example based on the precession of a spin proposed in [18], and the result (1.1) should\nbe independent of the choice. Our definition (1.7) has the property that Ij (a) naturally\nsplits into two parts distinguished by their Heisenberg dynamics: The outgoing current\nIj+ (a) which is essentially free in the future and the incoming current Ij\u2212 (a) which is free\nin the past. As the initial condition is set in the past of the measurement, only Ij+ (a)\nwill be affected by scattering.\n\u2022 Finally we ought to state the reference dynamics H0 to which H(s) is compared in the\ndefinition of the (frozen) scattering operator [22, 26]\nS(s) = S(H(s), H0) ,\n2\n\n(1.9)\n\nThe canonical choice of the current operators one normally finds in textbooks corresponds to f (x) =\n\u03b8(x).\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: A scatterer with two channels (left) and its disconnected analog (right). Neumann boundary conditions are imposed at the edges of the channels.\nwhose fibers S(s, E), called scattering matrices, appear in (1.1). While it turns out that\nthe choice of H0 is largely irrelevant, for the sake of simplicity let H0 be the Laplacian,\nacting on L2 (R+ , Cn ), with a Neumann boundary condition at x = 0. S(s, k 2 ), (k > 0),\nthen agrees with the familiar definition based on generalized eigenfunctions incident\nthrough lead i: (\u03b4ji e\u2212\u0131kx + Sji e\u0131kx )nj=1 . In particular, this reproduces the standard form\nof the scattering matrix of two channels:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr t\u2032\nS=\nt r\u2032\nwith r, r \u2032 the right and left reflection amplitudes and t, t\u2032 the corresponding transmission amplitudes.\nThe fundamental equation (1.1) may thus be given the following reformulation:\nZ \u221e\n\u0010 dS \u0011\n\u0131\n\u22121\nd\u03c1(E)\nlim lim \u03b5 hIij (s, a, \u03b5) = \u2212\nS\u2217\n.\na\u2192\u221e \u03b5\u21920\n2\u03c0 0\nds\njj\n\n(1.10)\n\nIn particular, for the Fermi sea \u03c1(H\u2212 ) = \u03b8(\u03bc \u2212 H\u2212 ) as initial state, we recover (1.1) from\nd\u03c1(E) = \u2212\u03b4(E \u2212 \u03bc)dE. The limit a \u2192 \u221e is taken so as to have the current measurement\nmade well outside of the scattering region, but after the adiabatic limit \u03b5 \u2192 0. By doing\nso, a current is still measured within the same epoch as the scattering process which\ngenerated it, though at a different time.\nThe result can be proven essentially in this form, though some problems that arise\nboth in the infrared and the ultraviolet have to be dealt with. In fact, the adiabatic limit\nis realized [5] in the regime where the dimensionless quantity given by \u03b5 times the dwelling\ntime of an electron in the pump is small. Low energy particles have a large dwell time in\nthe pumps and, in addition, may get trapped indefinitely as new bound states are born\nat the threshold E = 0. This means that no scattering description in terms of a single\nepoch is adequate at low energies. Similarly, at high energies resonances may become\nincreasingly sharp with correspondingly long dwelling times 3 . On the other hand, low,\nresp. high energy states do not contribute to the net current, since they are filled, resp.\n3\n\nIf the pump is a chaotic billiard, the classical dynamics will, in general, have arbitrarily long periodic\norbits. It is natural to expect that such orbits give rise to resonances.\n\n4\n\n\fempty in both the incoming and the outgoing flow. We shall therefore concentrate on\nthe contribution to the current coming from states in any intermediate energy range, as\nselected by the function \u03c7 below.\nTheorem 1.1. Let \u03c7 \u2208 C0\u221e (0, \u221e) with \u03c7 = 1 on supp d\u03c1. Redefine the current operator\n(with a UV and IR cutoff )\n\u0001\n\u0001\nIj,\u00b1 (s, a) = \u03c7 H(s) \u0131 [H(s), f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)]\u03c7 H(s) ,\n(a > 1) ,\n(1.11)\nin (1.7). Then\n\n\u0131\nlim lim \u03b5 hIij (s, a, \u03b5) = \u2212\na\u2192\u221e \u03b5\u21920\n2\u03c0\n\u22121\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c1(E)\n0\n\n\u0010 dS\nds\n\nS\u2217\n\n\u0011\n\njj\n\n,\n\n(1.12)\n\nwhere S = S(s, E). The double limit is uniform in s \u2208 I, I being a compact interval,\nR s/\u03b5\nRs\nwhence it carries over to the transfered charge 0 dt\u2032 hIij (\u03b5t\u2032 , a, \u03b5) = \u03b5\u22121 0 ds\u2032 hIij (s\u2032 , a, \u03b5).\nRemark. The auxiliary objects v and f affect the current operator. Nevertheless, they\ndisappear from its expectation value in the adiabatic and the large a limits. This may be\nphrased as the statement that different ammeters measure the same current.\n\nWe first give a heuristic derivation of Eq. (1.12), which may however serve as a guide\nthrough the complete proof. (For more hints, see [5].) One could argue that for computing\nthe expectation values of observables, which, like Ij,\u2212 (s, a), pertain to the incoming part\nof phase space, scattering may be ignored, i.e., one may pretend that the state of the\nsystem at epoch s simply is \u03c1(H(s)). On the other hand, when discussing Ij,+ (s, a) one\nshould do as if the state were\n\u03c1(H(s)) + \u03b5[S (1) (s), \u03c1(H(s))] + . . . ,\nwhere\nS\n\n(1)\n\n(s) = \u2212\u0131\n\nZ\n\n(1.13)\n\n\u221e\n\ndt t e\u0131H(s)t \u1e22(s)e\u2212\u0131H(s)t .\n\n(1.14)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThis comes from linearizing the Hamiltonian H(s + \u03b5t) = H(s) + \u03b5\u1e22(s)t + . . . around\nepoch s, since U = 1 + \u03b5S (1) (s) + . . . is then the propagator from t = \u2212\u221e to t = \u221e in the\ninteraction picture based on H(s). Now (1.13) is the state U\u03c1(H(s))U \u2217 after scattering.\nThe contribution of the first term there to hIij,+ cancels against hIij,\u2212 , see Lemma 2.2.\nThe contribution of second term is responsible for the r.h.s. of Eq. (1.12). To foreshadow\nthis outcome we formally rewrite it, see Lemma 5.4, as\n[S (1) (s), \u03c1(H(s))] = \u2212\u0131\u2202s\u2032 S(s\u2032 , s)s\u2032=s \u03c1\u2032 (H(s)) ,\nwith\n\u2032\n\n\u2202s\u2032 S(s , s)s\u2032 =s = \u2212\u0131\n\nZ\n\n(1.15)\n\n\u221e\n\ndt e\u0131H(s)t \u1e22(s)e\u2212\u0131H(s)t .\n\n(1.16)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nHere, 1 + (s\u2032 \u2212 s)\u2202s\u2032 S(s\u2032 , s)s\u2032=s + . . . is the Born approximation for the scattering matrix S(s\u2032 , s) for the pair of autonomous Hamiltonians (H(s\u2032 ), H(s)). The importance of\n5\n\n\fEq. (1.15) is twofold. First it reduces matters to \"frozen\" scattering data and their derivatives. Second, it makes it clear why only the variation d\u03c1(E) matters and, in particular,\nwhy for the Fermi sea \u03c1(\u03bb) = \u03b8(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bb) only states at the Fermi energy \u03bc contribute to\nthe current.\nLet us next discuss some of the conceptual issues involved in this result.\n1) Theorem 1.1 plays the role of the Kubo formula and like it gives a handle on\ntransport, including dissipative transport, using Hamiltonian evolution. A well known\nweakness of linear response theory, stressed by van Kampen [17], is that it takes the limit\nof linear response first and only then the thermodynamic limit. The correct order is, of\ncourse, the reverse. Theorem 1.1 is free of this criticism in that one starts with a system\nthat has infinite extent, for which it is nevertheless possible to estimate the error made\nby linearizing the dynamics, see Lemma 4.1. The reason for that is the finite extent of\nthe pump or, more precisely, the finite dwell times.\n2) Theorem 1.1 is an example of an adiabatic theorem for open, gapless systems. In\ncontrast to other results of that kind, such as [6, 3] which establish that an embedded\neigenstate evolves adiabatically, ours is about the evolution associated with an infinite\ndimensional spectral subspace, e.g. the Fermi sea. Moreover, the goal is not to establish\nthat a spectral subspace is preserved by the dynamics; rather, it is to determine the\namount by which it mingles with its complement, and the current is a measure thereof.\n3) On the l.h.s. of (1.12) the scattering process and the measurement of the current\nare described as a single quantum history. This should be contrasted to usual textbook\ntreatments of scattering rates, which have the following features: (i) The rates are computed classically as the product of a quantum mechanical scattering cross section and of\nan incident current; (ii) the use of the scattering cross section tacitly replaces the actual\nstate by its free asymptote. For a static potential and a steady beam both steps have\nbeen justified [11] in the limit where the measurement is deferred all the way to t \u2192 \u221e.\nThis is not quite so in the present fluctuating setting, where the ammeter is located at an\nintermediate scale, as specified by the order of the \u03b5, a limits: far away from the pump on\nthe scale of the scatterer, but close to it on the scale of the distance traveled by a particle\non the adiabatic time scale.\n4) The formula of B\u00fcttiker et al., Eq. (1.1), is pointwise in time. Suppose we represent\nthe flow by means of coherent states of widths \u2206E and \u2206t. In line with the remark just\nmade, one might suspect that \u2206t needs to be picked small w.r.t. to the adiabatic time\nscale \u03b5\u22121 , and hence \u2206E & ~\u03b5 by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. At temperature\n\u03b2 \u22121 the 1-particle distribution of the incoming flow is (1 + e\u03b2(E\u2212\u03bc) )\u22121 , which suggests that\n\u2206E . \u03b2 \u22121 . This seemingly presents an obstacle to applying scattering arguments when\n\u03b2 \u22121 < ~\u03b5. Our result, which applies to \u03c1(\u03bb) = \u03b8(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bb), shows that this obstacle can be\novercome, and that one can take the zero temperature limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e before taking \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nResults related to Theorem 1.1 have been obtained at the level of both physical and\nmathematical rigor. Among the former we mention, besides of [8, 7], the formula of Lee,\nLesovik and Levitov [18], which expresses the noise generated by quantum pumps (as\nwell as other moments) in terms of the scattering data. However, the relations regarding\nnoise are not local in time. Rather these are integral relations that hold for a cycle of\n6\n\n\fthe pump. Physically, what sets the current apart from the noise is its linear dependence\non \u03c1. Rigorous mathematical description of the adiabatic scattering of wave packets is\ndiscussed in [20, 19]. Like our result, they rely on propagation estimates.\nThe plan of the rest of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we shall verify that hIij (s, a, \u03b5)\nand the Stieltjes integral in (1.12) are well-defined. Further preliminaries, like propagation\nestimates, will be addressed in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we shall compute the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 of the\ncurrent in terms of data involving H(s) and \u1e22(s), but oblivious of the past {H(t)}t<s . The\nexpression will further reduce to the \"frozen\" scattering data (1.9) in Sect. 5 where the\nlimit a \u2192 \u221e is taken. In the Appendix we establish some trace class estimates for operators related to (1.11). The main ideas are further discussed at the beginning of Sects. 4, 5.\nWe conclude with a remark on notation. Multiple commutators are denoted by\n(k\u22121)\n(0)\n= [adA (B), A] with adA (B) = B. By F (A \u2265 a) we mean the spectral\nprojection of A onto [a, \u221e). The trace class ideal is denoted as J1 . Generic constants are\nindicated by C.\n(k)\nadA (B)\n\n2\n\nThe current operator and the scattering matrix\n\nThe state of independent quantum particles is described by a density matrix 0 \u2264 \u03c1\nnormalized so that tr \u03c1 is the number of particles. In the case of Fermions, \u03c1 \u2264 1.\nThermodynamic systems have tr \u03c1 = \u221e and observables that are otherwise innocent, and\nbounded operators in particular, may fail to have finite expectation values. For example,\nthe charge associated with the \"box\" f (A \u2212 a) in phase space is infinite. Nevertheless, the\ncurrent flowing into the box should have a finite expectation. We begin by showing that\nthe incoming and outgoing current operators of Eq. (1.7) are trace class and consequently,\nthe expectation value hIij (s, a, \u03b5) in any Fermionic state is well defined.\nA classical interpretation of the trace class condition is for the observable to be associated with a localized (bounded) function in phase space. The heuristic reason why the\ncurrent is trace class is then as follows: The commutator [H(s), f (Aj \u2212a)] is localized near\nthe boundary of the box: a curve (hyperbola) in phase space. This is where the ammeter\nis. The ultraviolet and infrared cutoff \u03c7(H(s)) then further delineate a compact region of\nphase space near the hyperbola. Our first preliminary result confirms this picture.\nProposition 2.1. The operator of incoming and outgoing current in the j-th channel,\nIj\u00b1 (s, a), is a trace class operator which is localized near \u00b1a in the sense that\nkF (|A \u2213 a| \u2265 \u03b1)Ij\u00b1 (s, a)k1 \u2264 CN (1 + \u03b1)\u2212N\n\n(2.1)\n\nfor all N \u2208 N, \u03b1 \u2265 0.\nProof. This proposition is a direct consequence of Lemma 3.3 below.\nThe pumping formula of Thm. 1.1 implies that no current flows if the pump is not\noperating, since dS/ds = 0 if H(s) is independent of s. Indeed, in the state \u03c1(H(s)), like\nin a thermal state, different leads are at equilibrium with one another; moreover, in each\n7\n\n\flead, right and left moving states yield compensating currents if equally occupied. When\nthe pump is in operation, it will still prove useful to know that no persistent currents are\nflowing in the \"adiabatic\" state \u03c1(H(s)).\nLemma 2.2. The currents in the state \u03c1(H(s)) vanish, namely\n\u0001\ntr \u03c1(H(s))(Ij+ (s, a) + Ij\u2212 (s, a)) = 0 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nProof. We omit s from the notation. Since I\u00b1 (a) \u2208 J1 it suffices to prove (2.2) for smooth\n\u03c1, since one may approximate the general case by a sequence s\u2212limn\u2192\u221e \u03c1n (H) = \u03c1(H).\nFirst we show that tr(\u03c1(H)I\u00b1 (a)) is independent of a. Note that I\u00b1 (a1 ) \u2212 I\u00b1 (a2 ) =\n\u03c7(H)\u0131[H, g(Aj )]\u03c7(H) with g(Aj ) = f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a1 ) \u2212 f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a2 ). Since \u03c7(H)g(Aj ) =\n\u03c7(H)g(A)\u03a0j \u2208 J1 , see (A.17), we have\ntr(\u03c1(H)(I\u00b1 (a1 ) \u2212 I\u00b1 (a2 ))) = \u0131 tr(\u03c1\u03c7(H)Hg(Aj )\u03c7(H) \u2212 \u03c1\u03c7(H)g(Aj )H\u03c7(H)) = 0 (2.3)\nby cyclicity. It thus suffices to prove (2.2) in the limit of a \u2192 \u221e. To this end, let H0 be the\nNeumann Hamiltonian on the leads introduced below Eq. (1.9), and let J : L2 (R+ , Cn ) \u2192\nH be the embedding given by (1.2). We maintain that\nlim k(\u03c1(H)I\u00b1 (a) \u2212 J\u03c1(H0 )I\u00b10 (a)J \u2217 k1 = 0 ,\n\na\u2192\u221e\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere I\u00b10 (a) is defined as in (1.11) with H replaced by H0 . Indeed, by expanding that\ncommutator we reduce matters to two estimates, both of the form\nlim k\u03c71 (H)f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)\u03c72 (H) \u2212 J\u03c71 (H0 )f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)\u03c72 (H0 )J \u2217 k1 = 0 ,\n\na\u2192\u221e\n\nwith \u03c7i \u2208 C0\u221e (R), (i = 1, 2). Then we write the difference as\n(\u03c71 (H) \u2212 J\u03c71 (H0 )J \u2217 )f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)\u03c72 (H) + J\u03c71 (H0 )J \u2217 f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)(\u03c72 (H) \u2212 J\u03c72 (H0 )J \u2217 ) .\nSince \u03c7i (H) \u2212 J\u03c7i (H0 )J \u2217 \u2208 J1 by (A.6) and s\u2212lima\u2192\u221e f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a) = 0, Eq. (2.4) follows.\nAt this point we only need\ntr(\u03c1(H0 )(I+0 (a) + I\u22120 (a)) = 0 ,\nwhich holds by time reversal invariance: For K\u03c8(x) = \u03c8\u0304(x) we have KH0 K = H0 , KAK\n= \u2212A and hence KI\u00b10 (a)K = \u2212I\u22130 (a).\nRemark. One can establish the result without explicitly using time reversal and using\ninstead the pull through formula Eq. (A.10).\nMourre theory, see e.g. [2], plays a double role in our analysis. First, it is at the heart\nof time dependent scattering theory and the propagation estimates that we shall discuss\nin the next section. At the same time, the theory also plays a role in time independent\nmethods and we shall use it to establish the differentiability of the scattering matrix which\nappears on the right hand side of Eq. (1.12).\n8\n\n\fProposition 2.3. Under the Assumptions A1-A5, the fibers of the frozen S matrix,\nS(s, E), are continuously differentiable in s at E > 0. In particular, the integral on\nthe right hand side of Eq. (1.12) is well defined for \u03c1 with bounded variation.\nProof. The Hamiltonians H(s) are dilation analytic of type (A) with respect to the\nconjugate operator A. In particular,\n(k)\n\nadA (H) is H(s)-bounded.\n\n(2.5)\n\nMore importantly, for any energy E > 0 the Mourre estimate holds\nE\u2206 (H(s))\u0131[H(s), A]E\u2206 (H(s)) \u2265 \u03b80 E\u2206 (H(s))\n\n(2.6)\n\nfor some open interval \u2206 \u220b E and \u03b80 > 0. Note that a compact term on the r.h.s\ncan be dismissed by Assumption A4. The Mourre estimate (2.6) is stable under small\nbounded perturbations of s, which is seen from (A.5) and from the fact that \u0131[H(s), A]\nis independent of s, just as the commutator in (1.7). Therefore, (2.6) holds uniformly in\ns \u2208 I and E \u2208 J, with J \u2282 (0, \u221e) compact, and so do the usual consequences of these\nassumptions. They comprise:\n1\n\ni) Resolvent smoothness. Let hAi = (1 + A2 ) 2 and r > 1/2. Then\nB(z, s) = hAi\u2212r (H(s) \u2212 z)\u22121 hAi\u2212r\nhas smooth boundary values at z = E + \u01310, (E \u2208 J), satisfying\nk\u2202Ek B(E + \u01310, s)k \u2264 Ck\n\n(2.7)\n\nfor k = 0, 1, . . ., see [16]. Since\n\u2202s B(z, s) = \u2212hAi\u2212r (H(s) \u2212 z)\u22121 \u1e22(s)(H(s) \u2212 z)\u22121 hAi\u2212r\nand \u1e22(s) = hAi\u2212r \u1e22(s)hAi\u2212r , the function B(E + \u01310, s) is jointly continuously differentiable in (E, s).\nii) H-smoothness. hAi\u2212r is H(s)-smooth [22, 26], as a consequence of (2.7) for k = 0.\niii) Stationary representation of the scattering matrix. Let\nZ \u2295\nEJ (H(s))H \u2192\nCn dE ,\n\u03c8 7\u2192 {\u03c8(E)}\n\n(2.8)\n\nJ\n\nbe the spectral representation for H(s) on J, and set \u03930 (E)\u03c8 = \u03c8(E). Then\n\u03930 (E)hAi\u2212r : H \u2192 Cn is bounded by (ii). Let S(s\u2032 , s) be the scattering operator for the pair (H(s\u2032), H(s)). Its fibers S(E) : Cn \u2192 Cn with respect to (2.8)\nadmit the representation [26]\nS(E) = 1 \u2212 2\u03c0\u0131\u03930 (\u03bb)(V \u2212 V (H(s\u2032) \u2212 (E + \u01310))\u22121 V )\u03930 (\u03bb)\u2217 ,\n\n(2.9)\n\nwith V = H(s\u2032)\u2212H(s). The r.h.s. is defined pointwise because of V = hAi\u2212r V hAi\u2212r\nand of (i). From this, Eq. (2.9), and the statements about B(E + \u01310, s) we see that\nS(s\u2032 , s)EJ (H(s)) is continuously differentiable in s\u2032 \u2208 I, and that the derivative\ncan be computed fiber-wise. The same applies to the scattering operator S(s) =\nS(H(s), H0), though (2.9) appears slightly modified.\n\n9\n\n\f3\n\nPropagation estimates\n\nPropagation estimates play a key and multiple role in our analysis. One role is that\nthey guarantee that particles do not get stuck in the pump. Consequently, the scattered\nparticle indeed sees a frozen scatterer to lowest order in the adiabatic limit, and a linearly\nchanging scatterer to first order. At the same time propagation estimates also play a role\nin establishing that the current measured by the ammeter at epoch s is determined by\nthe state of the pump at the same epoch, in the adiabatic limit. This may be interpreted\nas a statement that the particles neither linger nor disperse too badly in the channels 4 .\nPropagation estimates play yet another role in establishing the \"rigidity\" of the current:\nThe expectation value for the current a-priori depends on a choice of a switch function\nf , the function v(x) in the generator of dilation and a choice of the initial configuration\nof the pump, H\u2212 . This dependence is suppressed from our notation because Thm. 1.1\nimplies that the dependence disappears in the limit. Ultimately, this independence is a\nconsequence of propagation estimates.\nEq. (2.6) implies a minimal escape velocity estimate [12, 14] for the autonomous dynamics generated by H(s). The constants involved are understood as being uniform in\ns \u2208 I and in the stated range for a. Within proofs we shall abbreviate H \u2261 H(s).\nLemma 3.1. Let \u03c7 in C0\u221e (0, \u221e) (in particular with support away from E = 0). Then,\nfor some \u03b8 > 0, for all a \u2208 R, b, t \u2265 0 and N \u2208 N:\nkF (A \u2264 a \u2212 b + \u03b8t)e\u2212\u0131H(s)t \u03c7(H(s))F (A \u2265 a)k \u2264 CN (\u03b8)(b + \u03b8t)\u2212N .\n\n(3.1)\n\nSimilarly, if b, t < 0, then\nkF (A \u2265 a \u2212 b + \u03b8t)e\u2212\u0131H(s)t \u03c7(H(s))F (A \u2264 a)k \u2264 CN (\u03b8)|b + \u03b8t|\u2212N .\n\n(3.2)\n\nProof. The case of b = 0 is covered by Thm. 1.1 in [14], since its hypothesis (besides\n(k)\nof (2.6)) that adA (f (H)) is bounded for f \u2208 C0\u221e (R) and k \u2265 1 holds true by (2.5). To\nbe precise, the result is formulated there for supp \u03c7 \u2282 \u2206, where \u2206 is as in (2.6) and\n0 < \u03b8 < \u03b80 , but it extends to our case by a covering argument. Actually, the proof given\nthere essentially covers the general case b 6= 0. More precisely, let\nAt\u03c4 = \u03c4 \u22121 (A \u2212 a +\n\nb\n\u2212 \u03b80 t)\n2\n\nand f \u2208 C \u221e (R) be a function with |f (k) (x)| \u2264 Chxi\u2212k , f \u2032 \u2264 0, and f (x) = 0 for x \u2265 0.\nThen\nkf (At\u03c4 )e\u2212\u0131Ht \u03c7(H)F (A \u2265 a)k \u2264 CN \u03c4 \u2212N\nuniformly in 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03c4 and a \u2208 R. For b = 0, this is equation (2.11) in [14], whose proof\napplies to b \u2265 0 as well. Let \u03c4 = b + t. Since\nb \u2212 \u03b8t\nb/2 \u2212 \u03b80 t\n\u2265\n+\u03b4\nb+t\nb+t\n4\n\nDispersion arises because we use a non-relativistic (quadratic) kinetic energy in the leads. In much of\nthe literature on pumps dispersion is circumvented by making the kinetic energy linear in the momentum.\n\n10\n\n\ffor some \u03b4 > 0 and all b, t \u2265 0 we have\n\u0011\n\u0010 A \u2212 a + (b/2) \u2212 \u03b8 t\n0\n\u2264 \u2212\u03b4 \u2264 f (At\u03c4 )\nF (A \u2264 a \u2212 b + \u03b8t) \u2264 F\nb+t\nfor some f of the required type.\nThe lemma after next is a refined version of Prop. 2.1 above. The discussion is simplified by the observation that the regularized currents Eq. (1.11) may be written as\nIj\u00b1 (s, a) = \u03c7(H(s))\u0131[Hb (s), f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)]\u03c7(H(s)) ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere Hb (s) = H(s)b(H(s)) with b \u2208 C0\u221e (R) and b\u03c7 = \u03c7. The unregularized current,\nEq. (1.7), is independent of s by A3 and the commutation [H(s), \u03a0j ] = 0. Since the\ncommutation fails when H(s) is replaced by Hb (s) the regularized current is a-priori epoch\ndependent. However, the commutation is essentially recovered on the \"box\" f (\u00b1A \u2212 a)\nwhen a is large. More precisely:\nLemma 3.2. For j = 0, . . . n and a \u2265 \u22121 we have\nk[Hb (s), \u03a0j ]f (\u00b1A \u2212 a)(\u00b1A \u2212 a + \u0131)2 k \u2264 C\n\n(3.4)\n\nProof. Since (A + \u0131)\u22122 f (\u00b1A \u2212 a)(\u00b1A \u2212 a + \u0131)2 is uniformly bounded in a \u2265 1 we may\nprove instead that\nk[Hb (s), \u03a0j ](A + \u0131)2 k \u2264 C .\n(3.5)\nWe begin by showing that \u03a0i Hb \u03a0j (A+\u0131)2 = \u03a0i Hb \u03a0j (Aj +\u0131)2 is bounded for i 6= j. Indeed,\nHb (Aj + \u0131)2 = (Aj + \u0131)2 Hb + 2(Aj + \u0131)[Hb , Aj ] + [[Hb , Aj ], Aj ] ,\nfrom which we infer that (Aj + \u0131)\u22122 Hb (Aj + \u0131)2 is bounded. Hence so is (use \u03a0i Aj = 0)\n\u03a0i Hb \u03a0j (Aj + \u0131)2 = \u2212\u03a0i (Aj + \u0131)\u22122 Hb (Aj + \u0131)2 \u03a0j .\nP\nNow, setting \u03a0\u0304j = 1 \u2212 \u03a0j = nk=0,k6=j \u03a0k , we have\n[Hb , \u03a0j ](A + \u0131)2 = (\u03a0\u0304j Hb \u03a0j \u2212 \u03a0j Hb \u03a0\u0304j )(A + \u0131)2 ,\n\nand the result follows.\nThis implies that although the regularized current operator a-priori depends on the\nepoch and the pump, the dependence disappears in the limit of large a.\nLemma 3.3.\nk\u0131[Hb (s), f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)]\u03c7(H(s))k1 \u2264 C ,\nkF (A < \u00b1a \u2212 \u03b1)\u0131[Hb (s), f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)]\u03c7(H(s))k1 \u2264 CN (1 + \u03b1)\u2212N ,\nkF (A > \u00b1a + \u03b1)\u0131[Hb (s), f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)]\u03c7(H(s))k1 \u2264 CN (1 + \u03b1)\u2212N\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n\nfor a, \u03b1 \u2265 1. The same bounds hold in operator norm if \u03c7(H(s)) is replaced with (\u00b1A \u2212\na + \u0131)2 .\n11\n\n\fThe estimate (3.8) prevents the current operators from being located very far in the\noutgoing region of phase space. This will play a role in the next lemma and in Sect. 4.\nActually, instead of (3.8)\u2212 we shall use there the weaker statement with characteristic\nfunction F (A > a + \u03b1). The pair (3.7)+ and (3.8)\u2212 keeps the current operators away from\nthe pump, a property used in Sect. 5.\nProof. The estimates to be proven are of the form\nkT [Hb , f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)]\u03c7(H)k1 \u2264 kT [Hb , f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)](\u00b1A \u2212 a + \u0131)2 kk(\u00b1A \u2212 a + \u0131)\u22122 \u03c7(H)k1\n\u2264 CkT [Hb , f (\u00b1Aj \u2212 a)](\u00b1A \u2212 a + \u0131)2 k ,\n(3.9)\nwhere we used (A.16).\nWe then have to establish the corresponding bounds for the remaining operator norm.\nSince g(Aj ) = g(0)+(g(A)\u2212g(0))\u03a0j we have f (\u00b1Aj \u2212a) = f (\u00b1A\u2212a)\u03a0j due to f (\u2212a) = 0\nfor a > 1. Writing f = f f \u0303, where f \u0303(*) = f (* + 2), the commutator in (3.9) is\n[Hb , f \u03a0j f \u0303] = [Hb , f ]\u03a0j f \u0303 + f \u03a0j [Hb , f \u0303] + f [Hb , \u03a0j ]f \u0303 ,\nwith f \u0303 = f \u0303(\u00b1A \u2212 a). In the contribution to (3.9) of the first two terms the projections\n\u03a0j may be moved out to the right or to the left, using [T, \u03a0j ] = 0. As for the last term,\nwe use (3.4). At this point, (3.9) reduces to corresponding estimates for\nkT [Hb , f (A)](A + \u0131)2 k + kT f (A)k ,\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere we replaced \u00b1A \u2212 a by A, as the argument given below applies to the more general\ncase.\nIn the case of (3.6), where T = 1, the second term (3.10) is clearly bounded. On the\nfirst term we use the commutator expansion, see [13], eq. (B.16), or [10], based on the\nHelffer-Sj\u00f6strand representation of f (A).\n1\n(k)\n(\u22121)k\u22121 adA (Hb )f (k) (A) + Rm ,\nk!\nk=1\nZ\n1\n(m)\n= \u2212\ndx dy\u2202z\u0304 f \u0303(z)(A \u2212 z)\u22121 adA (Hb )(A \u2212 z)\u2212m ,\n\u03c0\n\n[Hb , f (A)] =\nRm\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere \u2202z\u0304 = (\u2202x + \u0131\u2202y )/2 and f \u0303 is an almost analytic extension of f , which may be chosen\nin such a way that\nZ\n\ndx dy|\u2202z\u0304 f \u0303(z)||y|\u2212p\u22121 \u2264 C\n\nm+2\nX\n\nkf (k) kk\u2212p\u22121\n\nk=0\n\nR\nfor p = 0, . . . n, the norms being defined as kf kk = dxhxik |f (x)|. The choice of [13] is\nsuch that if supp f \u2032 is compact, as it is in our case, then |y| \u2265 C1 |x| \u2212 C2 , (C1 , C2 > 0),\nfor z = x + \u0131y \u2208 supp f \u0303, which thus implies\nk(A \u2212 z)\u22121 (A + \u0131)k \u2264 C(|y|\u22121 + 1)\n12\n\n(3.12)\n\n\fThe expanded terms remain bounded if multiplied by (A + \u0131)2 from the right. For the\nremainder we obtain\n2\n\nkRm (A + \u0131) k \u2264\n\n(m)\nCkadA (Hb )k\n\nm+2\nX\n\n(kf (k) kk\u2212m\u22121 + kf (k) kk\u2212m+1 ) ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nk=0\n\nwhich is finite for m \u2265 3.\nWe shall next prove (3.7) with F (A < \u2212\u03b1) replaced by F (A < \u22123\u03b1) for easing notion\nbelow. This may be further replaced by f (\u2212\u03b1\u22121 A \u2212 2) because of F (A < \u22123\u03b1) = F (A <\n\u22123\u03b1)f (\u2212\u03b1\u22121 A \u2212 2). Since f (\u2212\u03b1\u22121 A \u2212 2)f (A) = 0, the claim Eq. (3.10) reads\nk[Hb , f (\u2212\u03b1\u22121 A \u2212 2)]f (A)(A + \u0131)2 k \u2264 CN \u03b1\u2212N .\n\n(3.14)\n\nWe now apply the expansion (3.11) to \u2212\u03b1\u22121 A \u2212 2 instead of A. Since f (k) (\u2212\u03b1\u22121 A \u2212\n2)f (A) = 0 only the remainder contributes. To bound kRm (A + \u0131)2 k we use k(\u2212\u03b1\u22121 A \u2212\n2 \u2212 z)\u22121 (A + \u0131)k \u2264 C\u03b1(|y|\u22121 + 1) instead of (3.12) and collect the powers of \u03b1\u22121 generated\nby each commutator. We so obtain the bound of (3.13) times \u03b1\u2212m+2 .\nFinally, (3.8) can be brought into a form similar to (3.7) by replacing f with f \u22121. Both\nfunctions have the same commutator with Hb but essentially complementary supports.\nIn Sect. 4 we shall describe the dynamics (1.3) in terms of the autonomous dynamics\ngenerated by the Hamiltonians H(s). Once this is achieved, the choice of an argument in\ninitial 1-particle density matrix \u03c1, be it H\u2212 or H(s), does not matter much for the current\nmeasurement, as defined by (1.11). This is the content of the following lemma.\nLemma 3.4. Let \u03c1, \u03c7 be as in Theorem 1.1. Then, for a \u2265 1,\nlim k(\u03c1(H(s)) \u2212 \u03c1(H\u2212 ))e\u2212\u0131H(s)t I\u00b1 (s, a)k1 = 0 .\n\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n(3.15)\n\nWe remark that no claim of uniformity w.r.t. s, a is made here. The statement for\nt \u2192 +\u221e is also true, but not needed.\nProof. We first consider the case where \u03c1 is smooth, and since H is bounded below we\nmay assume \u03c1 \u2208 C0\u221e (R). Then\n\u03c1(H) \u2212 \u03c1(H\u2212 ) \u2208 J1\n\n(3.16)\n\nby Eq. (A.5). To estimate the trace norm in (3.15) we use (3.3), insert 1 = F (A \u2264\na + \u03b1) + F (A > a + \u03b1) to the left of the commutator in (1.11), and use (3.6, 3.8). We so\nobtain the bound\nk(\u03c1(H) \u2212 \u03c1(H\u2212 ))e\u2212\u0131Ht \u03c7(H)F (A \u2264 a + \u03b1)k * C + CN \u03b1\u2212N .\n\n(3.17)\n\nThe remaining operator norm is bounded for t \u2264 0 by\nk(\u03c1(H) \u2212 \u03c1(H\u2212 ))F (A \u2264 a + \u03b1 + \u03b8t)k + CN t\u2212N ,\n13\n\n(3.18)\n\n\fwhere we used (3.2) with b = 0. We pick \u03b1 = \u2212\u03b8t/2, so that the remainder in (3.17)\ntends to zero, and s\u2212limt\u2192\u2212\u221e F (. . .) = 0 in (3.18). Since \u03c1(H) \u2212 \u03c1(H\u2212 ) is compact, the\nnorm vanishes in the limit.\nIn the general case, where \u03c1 is of bounded variation, let \u03c1n \u2208 C0\u221e (R), supn k\u03c1n k\u221e < \u221e,\nbe a sequence such that \u03c1n (\u03bb) \u2192 \u03c1(\u03bb) pointwise, whence s\u2212limn\u2192\u221e \u03c1n (H) = \u03c1(H), and\nthe same for H\u2212 instead of H. Also, s\u2212limt\u2192\u2212\u221e (e\u2212\u0131Ht Pac (H)\u2212e\u2212\u0131H\u2212 t \u03a9\u2212 ) = 0 by definition\nof the wave operator \u03a9\u2212 = \u03a9\u2212 (H\u2212 , H) [22, 26]. Since I\u00b1 (s, a) is trace class by (3.6) and\nsince\ns\u2212 lim Xn = 0 , Y \u2208 J1 \u21d2 lim kXn Y k1 = 0 ,\n(3.19)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwe have\nlim k(\u03c1n (H) \u2212 \u03c1(H))I\u00b1 (s, a)k1 = 0 ,\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlim k(\u03c1n (H\u2212 ) \u2212 \u03c1(H\u2212 ))\u03a9\u2212 I\u00b1 (s, a)k1 = 0 ,\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlim k(e\u2212\u0131Ht \u2212 e\u2212\u0131H\u2212 t \u03a9\u2212 )I\u00b1 (s, a)k1 = 0 ,\n\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere we dropped Pac (H) due to Pac (H)\u03c7(H) = \u03c7(H).

For large negative t the same is true for the second and the third term\nby (3.20) and the first part of the proof.\n\n4\n\nThe adiabatic limit\n\nThe current generated by adiabatic pumps can be understood within the general framework of the theory of linear response: The adiabatic limit corresponds to weak driving,\nand the formal derivation of Eq. (1.1) in [8] is a perturbation expansion. Formally, the\nchange in the state \u03c1 of system, obtained by linearizing the Hamiltonian around epoch s\nis\nZ 0\nU\u03b5 (s, s\u2212 )\u03c1(H(s))U\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s) \u2212 \u03c1(H(s)) \u2248 \u2212\u0131\u03b5\ndt t e\u0131H(s)t [\u1e22(s), \u03c1(H(s))]e\u2212\u0131H(s)t . (4.1)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nOne immediate difficulty with this expression is that the integrand on the right hand side\ngrows linearly with time. As an operator identity the above equation does not make sense,\nand the right hand side is not recognizably of order \u03b5.\nOne of the reasons why a perturbation expansion can nevertheless be made is that the\ncurrent of Eq. (1.11) has good localization in phase-space and so distinguishes a region\n14\n\n\fof phase space where \u03c1 is to be evaluated. Therefore, only a restricted range of times\ncontribute to the integral: The time associated with propagation from the pump to the\nammeter. This makes the expectation value of the current well defined. Estimates of this\nkind are known as propagation estimates and are controlled by Mourre theory.\nIn this section the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 in (1.12) is taken as a is kept fixed. The main result is\nthe following.\nProposition 4.1.

When applying (4.6)\nto I\u00b1 (s, a) it is thus appropriate to linearize H(s1 ) \u2212 H(s) around s.

We first consider the case where \u03c1 is smooth. Since T = \u03c7(H(s))(\u00b1A \u2212 a + \u0131)\u22122 \u2208\nJ1 by (A.16) and s\u2212lim\u03b1\u2192\u221e F (A > \u03b1) = 0 we have lim\u03b1\u2192\u221e kF (A > \u03b1)T k1 = 0. By\napproximation we may thus prove\nlim k(U\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s1 ) \u2212 us (s\u2212 \u2212 s1 ))us (s1 \u2212 s)\u03c1(H(s))\u03c7\u0303(H(s))F (A \u2264 \u03b1)k = 0 ,\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nwhere \u03c7\u0303 \u2208 C0\u221e (0, \u221e) with \u03c7\u0303\u03c7 = \u03c7. To estimate this operator norm we use (4.6) together\nwith\nkH(s2 ) \u2212 H(s)k \u2264 C|s2 \u2212 s|\n(4.16)\nto obtain the bound\nZ s1\n\u22121\nds2 |s2 \u2212 s|kF (A = 0)us (s2 \u2212 s)\u03c1(H(s))\u03c7\u0303(H(s))F (A \u2264 \u03b1)k \u2264 C\u03b5(1 + \u03b12 ) ,\n\u03b5\ns\u2212\n\nwhere we used, see the argument in connection with (4.10), that the norm under the\nintegral is bounded by F (s\u2212s2 \u2264 \u03b5\u03b8\u22121 \u03b1)+CN (1+\u03b5\u22121 |s2 \u2212s|)\u2212N . The general case, where\n\u03c1 is of bounded variation, is also dealt with by approximating \u03c1(H) = s\u2212limn\u2192\u221e \u03c1n (H)\nwith \u03c1n smooth. In fact we can pick n so that k(\u03c1n (H) \u2212 \u03c1(H))T k1 is arbitrarily small\n(uniformly in s).\nProof of Prop. 4.1. As mentioned in the introduction, U\u03b5 (s, s\u2212 )\u03c1(H\u2212 )U\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s) is independent of s\u2212 \u2264 0. We may thus evaluate the r.h.s. of (4.8) in the limit s\u2212 \u2192 \u221e. By\nestimate (3.15) and its adjoint, this amounts to replacing \u03c1(H\u2212 ) by \u03c1(H(s)), i.e.,\n\u03b5\u22121 tr(\u03c1(H\u2212 )U\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s)I\u00b1 (s, a)U\u03b5 (s, s\u2212 )) = \u03b5\u22121 tr(\u03c1(H(s))I\u00b1 (s, a))+\n\u03b5\u22121 Lim tr(X\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s)\u2217 us (s\u2212 \u2212 s)\u03c1(H(s))I\u00b1 (s, a)) +\ns\u2212 \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u22121\n\nLim tr(us (s \u2212 s\u2212 )X\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s)I\u00b1 (s, a)\u03c1(H(s))) + \u00d8\u03b5 ,\n\ns\u2212 \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n(4.17)\n\nwhere we also used [us (s \u2212 s\u2212 ), \u03c1(H(s))] = 0 and (4.13). The first term one the r.h.s. is\njust the equilibrium value of the current subtracted on the l.h.s. of Eq. (4.2). As we are\nnot going to show that the limits in (4.17) exist, they are just to be understood as sets of\nlimit points. We next claim that\n(1)\n\n\u03b5\u22121 Lim tr((X\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s)\u2217 us (s\u2212 \u2212 s) \u2212 \u03b5\u03a9\u2212 (s))\u03c1(H(s))I\u00b1 (s, a)) \u2192 0 ,\ns\u2212 \u2192\u221e\n\n(\u03b5 \u2192 0) . (4.18)\n\nBy taking the complex conjugate this implies\n(1)\n\n\u03b5\u22121 Lim tr(I\u00b1 (s, a)\u03c1(H(s))(us (s \u2212 s\u2212 )X\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s) + \u03b5\u03a9\u2212 (s))) \u2192 0 ,\ns\u2212 \u2192\u221e\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(\u03b5 \u2192 0) ,\n\nwhere we used \u03a9\u2212 (s)\u2217 = \u2212\u03a9\u2212 (s). Used together in (4.17) they prove (4.2).\nWe next note that, by a change of variables,\nZ s\n(1)\n\u22121\n\u03b5\u03a9\u2212 (s) = \u2212\u0131\u03b5\nds1 (s1 \u2212 s)us (s \u2212 s1 )\u1e22(s)us (s1 \u2212 s) .\n\u2212\u221e\n\n18\n\n\fAs noted before, the integral is convergent in trace class norm upon multiplication from\neither side with I\u00b1 (s, a). For the purpose of proving (4.18) we may thus assume it to\nhave s\u2212 as its lower limit of integration. Then the trace there, including the factor \u03b5\u22121 in\nfront, equals\nZ s\n\u22122\nds1 (s1 \u2212 s)\u00d7\n\u2212 \u0131\u03b5\ns\u2212\n\nWe use\n\n\u0001\ntr(us (s \u2212 s1 )\u1e22(s) U\u03b5 (s1 , s\u2212 )us (s\u2212 \u2212 s) \u2212 us (s1 \u2212 s) \u03c1(H(s))I\u00b1 (s, a)) .\n\n\u0001\nU\u03b5 (s1 , s\u2212 )us (s\u2212 \u2212 s) \u2212 us (s1 \u2212 s) = U\u03b5 (s1 , s\u2212 ) us (s\u2212 \u2212 s1 ) \u2212 U\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s1 ) us (s1 \u2212 s)\n\nand turn us (s \u2212 s1 )\u1e22(s) around the trace, so that the previous expression estimated as\nZ s\n\u0001\n\u22122\nds1 |s1 \u2212 s|k U\u03b5 (s\u2212 , s1 ) \u2212 us (s\u2212 \u2212 s1 ) us (s1 \u2212 s)\u03c1(H(s))\u03c7(H(s))(\u00b1A \u2212 a + \u0131)\u22122k1 \u00d7\n\u03b5\ns\u2212\n\nk(\u00b1A \u2212 a + \u0131)2 [Hb (s), f (\u00b1A \u2212 a)]\u03c7(H(s))us (s \u2212 s1 )F (A = 0)k .\n\nThe first factor tends to zero uniformly as \u03b5 \u2192 0 by (4.15), so we are left to show\nZ s\n\u22122\nds1 |s1 \u2212 s|kF (A = 0)us (s1 \u2212 s)\u03c7(H(s))[Hb (s), f (\u00b1A \u2212 a)](\u00b1A \u2212 a + \u0131)2 k \u2264 C .\n\u03b5\ns\u2212\n\n(4.19)\nWe insert 1 = F (A \u2264 a + \u03b1) + F (A > a + \u03b1) to the left of the commutator. By (3.6, 3.8)\nand the remark following them we obtain the bound\nZ s\n\u0001\n\u22122\nds1 |s1 \u2212 s| kF (A = 0)us (s1 \u2212 s)\u03c7(H(s))F (A \u2264 a + \u03b1)k + CN (1 + \u03b1)\u2212N ,\n\u03b5\ns\u2212\n\nwhere we take \u03b1 = 21 \u03b8\u03b5\u22121 (s \u2212 s1 ) > 0 as in (4.10). The resulting bound differs from (4.11)\nby having \u03c3 instead of \u03c3 2 . Hence the bound (4.19).\n\n5\n\nThe scattering limit\n\nIn the previous section we saw that the currents can be computed from frozen data in the\nadiabatic limit. These data were not directly related to the frozen scattering data and\n(1)\ninvolved objects like H(s) and \u03a9\u2212 (s). In this section we show that in the limit that the\nammeter is far, a \u2192 \u221e, then all we need to know is the frozen, scattering operator S and\nthe initial state \u03c1.\nFirst we show that in the large a limit the incoming, resp. outgoing currents have no\nscattering in the past, resp. the future. As usual, all statements are uniform in s \u2208 I.\nLemma 5.1. We have\n(1)\n\nlim k\u03a9\u2212 (s)I\u2212 (s, a)k1 = 0 ,\n\na\u2192\u221e\n\n(1)\n\nlim k(\u03a9\u2212 (s) \u2212 S (1) (s))I+ (s, a)k1 = 0 .\n\na\u2192\u221e\n\n19\n\n\fWe recall that S (1) was defined in (4.5). These facts will yield a first expression for\nthe scattering limit of the current, Eq. (4.4).\nLemma 5.2. We have\n\n\u0001\n(1)\nlim tr([\u03a9\u2212 (s), \u03c1(H(s))](I+ (s, a) + I\u2212 (s, a))) = tr [S (1) (s), \u03c1(H(s))]I+ (s, a) ,\n\na\u2192\u221e\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere a on the r.h.s. is arbitrary.\n\nWe then express the latter result in terms of \"frozen\" scattering data, such as the\nscattering operator S(s), defined in (1.9). Notice that it acts on the asymptotic Hilbert\nspace L2 (R+ , Cn ) of the channels, rather than to H. Further distinguished operators\nacting there are the Neumann Hamiltonian H0 , introduced in the introduction, and the\ngenerator of dilations,\nd\n1 d\nA0 = ( x + x ) ,\n2\u0131 dx\ndx\nwhich may be regarded as a model for (1.6). The trace (5.1) can then finally be computed\nexactly.\nProposition 5.3. Suppose, in addition to the hypotheses of Thm. 1.1, that \u03c1 is smooth.\nThen,\n\u0001\n\u0001\ntr [S (1) (s), \u03c1(H(s))]I+ (s, a) = \u2212\u0131 tr \u1e60(s)S(s)\u2217 \u03c1\u2032 (H0 )\u03a0j \u0131[H0 , f (A0 \u2212 a)] (5.2)\nZ \u221e\n\u0010 dS \u0011\n\u0131\n= \u2212\nd\u03c1(E)\nS\u2217\n,\n(5.3)\n2\u03c0 0\nds\njj\nwhere A0j = A0 \u03a0j , and the scattering operator S(s) is defined in Eq. (1.9).\nFor \u03c1 which is not smooth an approximation argument will complete the task.\nProof of Lemma 5.1. Both claims of this proposition are the consequence of the stronger\nbound:\n(1)\nk\u03a9\u00b1 (s)I\u00b1 (s, a)k1 \u2264 CN a\u2212(N \u22122) ,\nfor large enough N. Let us proof this bound for a case of \u03a9\u2212 , the proof for \u03a9+ follows\nthe same lines. It is clear from Eq. (4.3) that we may establish that bound for\nZ 0\ndt |t| * kF (A = 0)e\u2212\u0131H(s)t I\u2212 (s, a)k1 .\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe norm under this integral also appeared under the integral (4.9). We estimate\nit similarly by means of (3.3, 3.8), except that we insert F (A \u2264 \u2212a + \u03b1) (and the\ncomplementary projection) instead of F (A \u2264 a + \u03b1). By (3.2) we get\nkF (A = 0)e\u2212\u0131H(s)t I\u2212 (s, a)k1 \u2264 CkF (A = 0)F (A \u2264 \u2212a + \u03b1 \u2212 b + \u03b8t)k\n+CN (|b| + |t|)\u2212N + CN \u03b1\u2212N .\nChoosing b = \u2212a/2, \u03b1 = (a/2 \u2212 \u03b8t)/2 > 0, we see that the first term vanishes and we\nobtain the desired bound since\nZ 0\na\ndt |t|( + \u03b8|t|)\u2212N \u2264 CN a\u2212(N \u22122) .\n2\n\u2212\u221e\n\n20\n\n\fAn ingredient to the proof of Prop. 5.3 and, to a minor extent, of Lemma 5.2 are the\nrelations Eqs. (1.15, 1.16). Formally, Eq. (1.15) follows for \u03c1(\u03bb) = e\u0131\u03bbt , (t \u2208 R), by a\nchange of variables in (1.14) and hence for general functions \u03c1. For our purposes we shall\nneed a somewhat more precise statement, given by the first part of the following lemma\n(cf. the first remark after Prop. 4.1).\nLemma 5.4. (a) Eq. (1.16) and, for \u03c1 smooth, Eq. (1.15) hold true if multiplied from\neither side by I+ (s, a).\n\u2032\n(b) The wave operators \u03a9\u00b1 (s\u2032 , s) = s\u2212limT \u2192\u00b1\u221e e\u0131H(s )T e\u2212\u0131H(s)T Pac (H(s)) for the pair\n(H(s\u2032 ), H(s)) satisfy the intertwining property\nf (H(s\u2032))\u03a9\u00b1 (s\u2032 , s) = \u03a9\u00b1 (s\u2032 , s)f (H(s))\n\n(5.4)\n\nfor any (Borel) function f .\n(c) The scattering operators for the pairs (H(s), H(si )), (i = 1, 2) are related as\nS(s, s2 ) = \u03a9+ (s2 , s1 )S(s, s1)\u03a9\u2212 (s2 , s1 )\u2217 .\n\n(5.5)\n\nProof. Parts (b, c) are standard [22, 5]. The wave operators exist and are complete\nunder our assumptions. The chain rule for wave operators,\n\u03a9\u00b1 (s, s1 ) = \u03a9\u00b1 (s, s2 )\u03a9\u00b1 (s2 , s1 ) ,\nand S(s, si ) = \u03a9+ (s, si )\u2217 \u03a9\u2212 (s, si ) imply S(s, s1 ) = \u03a9+ (s2 , s1 )\u2217 S(s, s2)\u03a9\u2212 (s2 , s1 ). From\nthis (5.5) follows by the completeness of scattering, \u03a9\u00b1 (s2 , s1 )\u2217 \u03a9\u00b1 (s2 , s1 ) = Pac (H(s2 )).\nWe begin the proof of part (a) by claiming that\nk(\u03a9+ (s\u2032 , s) \u2212 1)\u03c7(H(s))k \u2264 C|s\u2032 \u2212 s| ,\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhere \u03c7 \u2208 C0\u221e (0, \u221e). Indeed, let \u03c7\u0303 \u2208 C0\u221e (0, \u221e) with \u03c7\u0303\u03c7 = \u03c7. Then, by (5.4), k(\u03a9+ \u2212\n1)\u03c7(H(s))k \u2264 k\u03c7\u0303(H(s\u2032))(\u03a9+ \u2212 1)\u03c7(H(s))k + k\u03c7\u0303(H(s\u2032))\u03c7(H(s)) \u2212 \u03c7(H(s))k. The second\nterm is bounded by k\u03c7\u0303(H(s\u2032 )) \u2212 \u03c7\u0303(H(s))k, and fits the bound (5.6) by (A.5). For the first\nterm we use the fundamental theorem of calculus:\nZ T\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c7\u0303(H(s ))(\u03a9+ (s , s)\u22121)\u03c7(H(s)) = s\u2212 lim \u0131\ndt \u03c7\u0303(H(s\u2032))e\u0131H(s )t V e\u2212\u0131H(s)t \u03c7(H(s)) , (5.7)\nT \u2192\u221e\n\n0\n\nwhere V = H(s\u2032 ) \u2212 H(s). We write V = hAi\u2212r V hAi\u2212r and use (4.16) for V , as well the\nH(s)-smoothness of hAi\u2212r \u03c7(H(s)) for r > 1/2 (and similarly for s\u2032 ), see item (ii) in Sect. 2.\nAn application of the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality on matrix elements of (5.7) yields (5.6).\nWe can now prove the statement about Eq. (1.16), whose r.h.s. we denote by T . Then\nT I+ (s, a) is a convergent integral by (4.12). Moreover, T e\u2212\u0131H(s)t I+ (s, a) = e\u2212\u0131H(s)t T I+ (s, a),\nwhence T \u03c7\u0303(H(s))I+ (s, a) = \u03c7\u0303(H(s))T I+ (s, a) for \u03c7\u0303 \u2208 C0\u221e (0, \u221e). Since \u03c7\u0303(H(s))I+ (s, a) =\nI+ (s, a) for \u03c7\u0303\u03c7 = \u03c7 and \u03c7 as in (1.11), we may thus prove\nZ \u221e\n\u2032\n\u03c7\u0303(H(s))\u2202s\u2032 S(s , s)s\u2032 =s I+ (s, a) = \u2212\u0131\u03c7\u0303(H(s))\ndt e\u0131H(s)t \u1e22(s)e\u2212\u0131H(s)t I+ (s, a) .\n(5.8)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n21\n\n\fWe write S \u2212 1 = \u03a9\u2217+ (\u03a9\u2212 \u2212 \u03a9+ ), so that\n\u2032\n\n\u03c7\u0303(H(s))(S(s , s) \u2212 1)I+ (s, a) =\n\n\u2212\u0131\u03c7\u0303(H(s))\u03a9\u2217+\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2032\n\ndt e\u0131H(s )t V e\u2212\u0131H(s)t I+ (s, a)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\ndt e\u0131H(s)t \u03c7\u0303(H(s))(\u03a9\u2217+ \u2212 1)V e\u2212\u0131H(s)t I+ (s, a)\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u2212\u0131\u03c7\u0303(H(s))\ndt e\u0131H(s)t V e\u2212\u0131H(s)t I+ (s, a) .\n\n= \u2212\u0131\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe first integral is estimated as C(a)|s\u2032 \u2212 s|2 due to Eqs. (5.6, 4.16, 4.12). In the second\none, the contribution coming from the remainder in V = \u1e22(s)(s\u2032 \u2212 s) + O((s\u2032 \u2212 s)2 ) is\nestimated the same way. This implies (5.8).\nAs for Eq. (1.15) in the case \u03c1(\u03bb) = e\u0131\u03bbt , the change of variables mentioned before\nis legitimate, as the integrals are convergent once multiplied with I+ (s, a) due to (4.12).\nThe result extends to \u03c1(H(s)) with \u03c1 \u2208 C0\u221e (R) or \u03c1\u2032 \u2208 C0\u221e (R), which amounts to the\nsame since H(s) is bounded below.\n(1)\nProof of\n\u0001 Lemma 5.2. By Lemma 5.1 the l.h.s. of (5.1) equals lima\u2192\u221e tr [S (s), \u03c1(H(s))]\nI+ (s, a) , provided this limit exists. It does, since the expression is independent of a. For\n\u03c1 smooth this follows from Lemma 5.4. Indeed, the r.h.s. of (1.15) commutes with\nH(s), so that the independence is seen as in (2.3). For general \u03c1 the conclusion follows\nby approximation by a sequence {\u03c1n } of smooth functions, such that s\u2212lim \u03c1n (H(s)) =\n\u03c1(H(s)). The traces converge by (3.19).\n\nProof of Prop. 5.3. For the sake of precision we recall that the scattering operator S(s) =\n\u03a9+ (s)\u2217 \u03a9\u2212 (s) depends on wave operators defined in a two-Hilbert space setting: \u03a9\u00b1 (s) =\ns\u2212limT \u2192\u00b1\u221e e\u0131H(s)T Je\u2212\u0131H0 T , where J : L2 (R+ , Cn ) \u2192 H is the embedding given by (1.2).\nWe may also replace J by a smooth function J \u0303 on R, which equals 0 near x = 0, and 1\nnear x = \u221e. This is without effect on \u03a9\u00b1 (s), since s\u2212limT \u2192\u00b1\u221e (J \u2212 J \u0303)e\u2212\u0131H0 T = 0. In\nparticular, we may pick J \u0303 so that J \u0303 = 1 on supp v, see (1.6). In the present context (5.5)\nreads S(s\u2032 , s) = \u03a9+ (s)S(s\u2032 )\u03a9\u2212 (s)\u2217 and implies\n\u2202s\u2032 S(s\u2032 , s)s\u2032 =s = \u03a9+ (s)\u1e60(s)\u03a9\u2212 (s)\u2217 ,\nwhere the differentiability is granted e.g. after multiplication with I+ (s, a).\nWe now prove Eq. (5.2) with \u03a0j \u0131[H0 , f (A0 \u2212 a)] replaced by \u03a0j \u0131[H0 , f (A \u2212 a)] =\n\u0131[H0 , f (Aj \u2212 a)]. Its l.h.s. equals, by Lemma 5.4,\n\u0001\ntr \u03a9+ (s)\u1e60(s)\u03a9\u2212 (s)\u2217 \u03c1\u2032 (H(s))\u03c7(H(s))I+ (a)\u03c7(H(s))\n\u0001\n= tr \u1e60(s)S(s)\u2217 \u03c1\u2032 (H0 )\u03c7(H0 )I+ (a)\u03c7(H0 )\n\u0001\n+ tr \u1e60(s)\u03a9\u2212 (s)\u2217 \u03c1\u2032 (H(s))\u03c7(H(s))[I+(a), \u03a9+ (s)]\u03c7(H0 ) .\n\nHere I+ (a) is defined in Eq. (1.7). We turned \u03a9+ (s) around the trace, which thereby\nmoved from H to L2 (R+ , Cn ). The first term corresponds to the claim, since \u03c7\u03c1\u2032 \u03c7 = \u03c1\u2032 .\n22\n\n\fIt is again independent of a. The second term will thus vanish as soon as it does in limit\n \u0303 by the above choice\na \u2192 \u221e. The commutator there is [I+ (a), \u03a9+ (s)] = [I+ (a), \u03a9+ (s) \u2212 J]\nJ \u0303. We are so left to show that\n \u0303\nlim k\u03c7(H(s))(\u03a9+ (s) \u2212 J)\u03c7(H\n0 )I+ (a)k1 = 0 ,\n\na\u2192\u221e\n\nand also with \u03a9+ (s) replaced by \u03a9+ (s)\u2217 and \u03c7(H0 ), \u03c7(H(s)) interchanged. Using the\nintegral representation for \u03a9+ (s) \u2212 J \u0303 the estimate reduces to\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u0131H0 t\n \u0303\ndt k\u03c7(H(s)[H0, J]\u03c7(H\nI+ (a)k1\n0 )e\nZ \u221e\n\u2264C\ndt kF (A = 0)\u03c7(H0 )e\u2212\u0131H0 t I+ (a)k1 \u2192 0 ,\n\n(a \u2192 \u221e) ,\n\n0\n\n(and with H0 , H(s) interchanged) which holds true by the estimates in the proof of\nLemma 5.1.\nWe next replace A by A0 on the r.h.s. of (5.2). Since both traces are independent of a\nwe may, in each of them, replace f by a smeared switch function f \u0303\u2032 , such that f \u0303 \u2208 H 2 (d)\nwith d > 2 (see the Appendix for notation). Since (f \u0303(Aj ) \u2212 f \u0303(A0j ))\u03c1\u2032 (H0 ) \u2208 J1 by (A.12),\nthe difference is seen to vanish by cyclicity.\nFinally, to prove (5.3), we may keep f replaced by f \u0303 as before. It follows from\nEqs. (A.10, A.2) that\ntr \u1e60(s)S(s)\u2217 \u03c1\u2032 (H0 )\u03a0j [H0 , f \u0303(A0 \u2212 a)]\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n= tr \u1e60(s)S(s)\u2217 \u03c1\u2032 (H0 )\u03a0j (f \u0303(A0 \u2212 a \u2212 2\u0131) \u2212 f \u0303(A0 \u2212 a))H0\nZ \u221e\n\u0010 dS \u0011 Z \u221e\n1\ndE \u2032\n=\n\u03c1 (E)E\nS\u2217\n*\nd\u03bb (f \u0303(\u03bb \u2212 a \u2212 2\u0131) \u2212 f \u0303(\u03bb \u2212 a)) .\n2\u03c0 0 2E\nds\njj\n\u2212\u221e\nR\u221e\nTo compute the last integral, note that \u2212\u221e d\u03bb (f \u0303(\u03bb \u2212 c) \u2212 f \u0303(\u03bb)) = \u2212c for any c \u2208 R\nwhich extends by analyticity to | Im c| < d. Hence the result.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. We have shown that\ntr [S\n\n(1)\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0131\n(s), \u03c1(H(s))]I+ (s, a) = \u2212\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c1(E)\n0\n\n\u0010 dS\nds\n\nS\n\n\u2217\n\n\u0011\n\njj\n\n(5.9)\n\nholds true if \u03c1 is smooth. If \u03c1 is of bounded variation it can be approximated by a\nsequence \u03c1n \u2208 C0\u221e (R) with \u03c1n (\u03bb) \u2192 \u03c1(\u03bb) pointwise and uniformly bounded total variation\nsupn V (\u03c1n ) < \u221e. Then s\u2212limn \u03c1n (H(s)) = \u03c1(H(s)) and d\u03c1n (\u03bb) \u2192 d\u03c1(\u03bb) in the sense of\nweak* convergence. Hence (5.9) is inherited by the limit. The proof is completed by\nEqs. (4.4) and (5.1).\n\n23\n\n\fA\n\nAppendix. Trace class properties of g(H)f (A)\n\nIn this section we will discuss different properties of the operator product g(H(s))f (A).\nWe first prove that operators of the form g(H0)f (A0 ) are Hilbert-Schmidt under suitable\nconditions on the functions g and f . For operator of this type one can essentially write\ndown the integral kernel, and use it in order to compute the Hilbert-Schmidt norm.\nHeuristically the trace of an operator is the integral over phase space of the symbol\n(divided by 2\u03c0). Since\nZ\nZ\n1\ndE\n1\ndxdp =\nda ,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2E\nunder the map (x, p) 7\u2192 (E = p2 , a = px), we introduce the norms\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\ndE\n2\n2\n2\nkf k =\nda |f (a)| ,\n|||g||| =\n|g(E)|2 ,\n2E\n\u2212\u221e\n0\n\u02c6\non functions\nR \u2212\u0131\u03bbtf on the real line, resp. g on the half\u2013line. The Fourier transform is f (t) =\n\u22121\n(2\u03c0)\ne f (\u03bb)d\u03bb.\nProposition A.1. We have\n\nkg(H0 )f (A0 )k2 = (2\u03c0)\u22121/2 |||g||| * kf k .\nIf g and f\u02c6 are continuous and the operator g(H0)f (A0 ) is trace class, then\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\ndE\n1\ng(E) *\ntr (g(H0)f (A0 )) =\nda f (a) .\n2\u03c0 0 2E\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(A.1)\n\n(A.2)\n\nProof. The space L2 (R+ ) can be identified with the even functions in L2 (R) by means\nof the map (J\u03c6)(x) = \u03c6(|x|), with kJ\u03c6k2 = 2k\u03c6k2 . Consider the operator g(p2)f (A0 ) on\nL2 (R). Since it preserves parity and p2 reduces to H0 on the (so identified) subspace of\neven functions (with projection P+ ) we have\nkg(H0)f (A0 )k22 = trL2 (R+ ) (\u1e21(H0 )|f |2(A0 )g(H0))\n1\ntrL2 (R) (P+ \u1e21(p2 )|f |2(A0 )g(p2)P+ )\n=\n2\n1\n=\ntrL2 (R) (U \u2217 P+ \u1e21(p2 )|f |2(A0 )g(p2)P+ U)\n2\n1\ntrL2 (R) (P+ \u1e21(x2 )|f |2 (\u2212A0 )g(x2 )P+ )\n=\n2\n= trL2 (R+ ) (\u1e21(x2 )|f |2(\u2212A0 )g(x2 )) ,\n\n(A.3)\n\nwhere (U\u03c8)(k) = (2\u03c0)1/2 \u03c8\u0302(k) is the Fourier transform: [U, P+ ] = 0, P+ = (1 + U 2 )/2,\npU = \u2212Ux, and A0 U = \u2212A0 U.

For general\ng \u2208 C0\u221e (R), as well as for the rest of this proof, we use the Helffer-Sj\u00f6strand representation,\nZ\n1\n(H \u2212 z)\u22121 \u2202z\u0304 g\u0303(z)dxdy ,\n(A.7)\ng(H) =\n\u03c0 R2\nwhere \u2202z\u0304 = (\u2202x + \u0131\u2202y )/2, and g\u0303 is an almost analytic extension of g with g\u0303(z) vanishing to\na high power near the real axis. Before doing that, we set G(\u03bb) = g(\u03bb)(\u03bb + \u0131)2m , so that\nthe first term in\ng(H(s)) \u2212 g(H(s\u2032)) = (R(s)2m \u2212 R(s\u2032 )2m )G(H(s\u2032)) + R(s)2m (G(H(s)) \u2212 G(H(s\u2032 ))\nis taken care of. For the second, we apply (A.7) to G and are led to estimate\nkR(s)2m [(H(s) \u2212 z)\u22121 \u2212 (H(s\u2032 ) \u2212 z)\u22121 ]k1 \u2264\nk(H(s) \u2212 z)\u22121 kkR(s)2m \u03a00 k1 kH(s\u2032) \u2212 H(s)kk(H(s\u2032) \u2212 z)\u22121 k \u2264 C| Im z|\u22122 |s \u2212 s\u2032 | ,\n25\n\n\fwhich completes the proof of (A.5).\nBefore proving (A.6) we claim that\ng(H)h \u2208 J1 ,\n\n(A.8)\n\nwhere h acts as multiplication by h \u2208 C0\u221e [0, \u221e) on L2 (R+ , Cn ) and by h(0) on H0 .\nSince g(H)\u03a00 \u2208 J1 it will be enough to show (1 \u2212 \u03a00 )g(H)(1 \u2212 \u03a00 )h \u2208 J1 or actually just\nkJ(H \u2212z)\u22121 J \u2217 h(x)k1 \u2264 C| Im z|\u22121 . Since the kernel of (H \u2212z)\u22121 is decaying exponentially\n[9], matters are further reduced to\nkJL (H \u2212 z)\u22121 JL\u2217 k1 \u2264 C| Im z|\u22121 ,\nas an operator on L2 ([0, L], Cn ), where JL is the corresponding embedding operator into\nH. The initial piece [0, L] has to be taken large enough, so that supp h \u2282 [0, L). Let now\nB be the quadratic form of the Bilaplacian,\nZ L\nB(\u03c6, \u03c8) =\n\u03c6\u0304\u2032\u2032 (x)\u03c8 \u2032\u2032 (x)dx ,\n(A.9)\n0\n\nwith domain given by the Sobolev space W 2 (0, L). We maintain that\nk(1 + B)1/2 JL (H \u2212 z)\u22121 JL\u2217 k \u2264 C| Im z|\u22121 ,\n(1 + B)\u22121/2 \u2208 J1 ,\nwhich imply the claim. The first statement follows by A3 and (A.9) from\nJL (H \u2212 z\u0304)\u22121 JL\u2217 BJL (H \u2212 z)\u22121 JL\u2217 = T \u2217 T ,\nwith T = 1 + zJL (H \u2212 z)\u22121 JL\u2217 . The second statement can be seen by computing the eigenvalues k 4 of the operator B associated to (A.9). The latter is given as B = d4 /dx4 with\nboundary conditions \u03c6\u2032\u2032 = \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2032 = 0 at x = 0, L. From this one computes the eigenvalues\nas the zeros of 1 \u2212 cosh kL cos kL.\nTo prove (A.6) we make use of a smooth embedding J \u0303 as in the proof of Prop. 5.3.\n \u0303\nSince (J \u2212 J)g(H\n0 ) \u2208 J1 (see [21], Thm. XI.20) we will prove the trace class property for\n \u0303\n \u0303\u2217\n \u0303  \u0303\u2217\n \u0303  \u0303\n \u0303\u2217\ng(H) \u2212 Jg(H\n0 )J = g(H)(1 \u2212 J J ) + (g(H)J \u2212 Jg(H0 ))J .\nThe first term is trace class by (A.8). For the second term, Eq. (A.7) and the resolvent\nidentity reduce matters to\n \u0303 H]kkh(x)(H0 \u2212 z)\u22121 k1 \u2264 C| Im z|\u22122 ,\nk(H \u2212 z)\u22121 [J \u0303, H](H0 \u2212 z)\u22121 J \u0303\u2217 k1 \u2264 k(H \u2212 z)\u22121 [J,\nwhere h \u2208 C0\u221e (R) with hJ \u0303\u2032 = J \u0303\u2032 .\nThe Hardy class H 2 (d) consists of all functions f , analytic in the strip {z | | Im z| < d},\nwhich satisfy\nZ\n\u221e\n\n|f (x + \u0131y)|2dx < \u221e .\n\nsup\n\n\u2212d<y<d\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nWe recall that f \u2208 H 2 (d) is also characterized by sup0<y<d key|k| f\u02c6(k)k2 < \u221e.\n26\n\n\fProposition A.3 (The pull-through formula). For any f \u2208 H 2 (d) with d > 2\nH0 f (A0 ) = f (A0 \u2212 2\u0131)H0 .\n\n(A.10)\n\nProof. We first prove the statement for f (x) = e\u2212\u0131tx . Under conjugation with the dilation\noperator, (e\u2212\u0131tA0 \u03c8)(x) = e\u2212t/2 \u03c8(e\u2212t x), the Neumann Laplacian becomes\ne\u0131tA0 H0 e\u2212\u0131tA0 = e\u22122t H0 ,\n\n(A.11)\n\nhence H0 e\u2212\u0131tA0 = e\u2212\u0131t(A0 \u22122\u0131) H0 . Now, for f \u2208 H 2 (d),\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u0131tA0 \u02c6\nH0 f (A0 ) =\nH0 e f (t)dt =\ne\u0131t(A0 \u22122\u0131) H0 f\u02c6(t)dt = f (A0 \u2212 2\u0131)H0 ,\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the last step is justified by the above mentioned property of the Hardy class functions.\nLemma A.4. Let f \u2032 \u2208 H 2 (d) with d > 2 and g \u2208 C0\u221e (R). Then\n(f (A) \u2212 f (A0 ))g(H0 ) \u2208 J1 .\n(A.12)\nR\u221e\nProof. As mentioned, the Fourier transform of f \u2032 (\u03bb) = \u2212\u221e dt ei\u03bbt fb\u2032 (t) is bounded as\nfor any y < d. We represent f as\n\n|fb\u2032(t)| \u2264 Ce\u2212y|t| ,\nZ\n\n(A.13)\n\n\u0010 e\u0131\u03bbt \u2212 1 \u0011\nf (\u03bb) = f (0) +\ndt\nfb\u2032 (t) ,\n\u0131t\n\u2212\u221e\n\nand write\n1 \u0131At\n1\n(e \u2212 e\u0131A0 t ) =\n\u0131t\nt\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nt\n\nds e\u0131A(t\u2212s) (A \u2212 A0 )e\u0131A0 s , e\u0131A0 s g(H0 ) = g(H0e\u22122s )e\u0131A0 s ,\n\n0\n\nwhich follows from (A.11). Applying Thm. XI.20 [21] to\ni\n(A \u2212 A0 )g(H0 e\u22122s ) = (w(x)p \u2212 w \u2032 (x))g(H0 e\u22122s ) ,\n2\nwhere w(x) = v(x) \u2212 x, one finds\n3\n\n1\n\nk(A \u2212 A0 )g(H0 e\u22122s )k1 \u2264 C\u03b4 (es( 2 +\u03b4) + es( 2 +\u03b4) ) ,\n \u0303\nfor any \u03b4 > 12 . We obtain kt\u22121 (e\u0131At \u2212 e\u0131A0 t )g(H0 )k1 \u2264 C(1 + edt ) with d \u0303 =\n\u03b4 so that d \u0303 < d, we obtain the claim from Eq. (A.13).\n\n(A.14)\n3\n2\n\n+ \u03b4. Picking\n\nThe following example will be useful.\nLemma A.5.\nkH0 (H0 + 1)\u22122 (A0 \u2212 z)\u22122 k1 \u2264 C| Im z|\u22122 .\n27\n\n(A.15)\n\n\fProof. It suffices to prove the claim for | Im z| large enough since k(A0 \u2212 z + \u0131y)(A0 \u2212\nz)\u22121 k \u2264 C| Im z|\u22122 for small | Im z|. We shall do that for | Im z| > 4. By the pull-through\nformula, Eq. (A.10), we compute\nH0 (A0 \u2212 z)\u22121 = (A0 \u2212 z \u2212 2\u0131)\u22121 H0\n= (A0 \u2212 z \u2212 2\u0131)\u22121 (H02 + 2H0 + 1)H0 (H0 + 1)\u22122\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= H02 (A0 \u2212 z + 2\u0131)\u22121 + 2H0 (A0 \u2212 z)\u22121 + (A0 \u2212 z \u2212 2\u0131)\u22121 H0 (H0 + 1)\u22122 .\n\nWe multiply this expression from the left by (H0 + 1)\u22122 and from the right by (A0 \u2212 z)\u22122 ,\nso as to obtain the bound\nkH0 (H0 + 1)\u22122 (A0 \u2212 z)\u22122 k1 \u2264\n\n1\nX\n\nk(A0 \u2212 z + 2k\u0131)\u22121 H0 (H0 + 1)\u22122 (A0 \u2212 z2 )\u22121 k1 .\n\nk=\u22121\n1/2\n\nEq. (A.1) now yields kH0 (H0 + 1)\u22121 (A0 \u2212 z)\u22121 k2 = (2| Im z|)\u22121/2 . Hence (A.15) follows\nfrom the H\u00f6lder inequality.\nLemma A.6. For g \u2208 C0\u221e (0, \u221e) we have\nsup k(A \u2212 a \u00b1 \u0131)\u22122 g(H)k1 < \u221e .\n\n(A.16)\n\na\u2208R\n\nIn particular, for any f \u2208 C \u221e (R) with f (x)(x + \u0131)2 bounded,\nf (A)g(H) \u2208 J1 .\n\n(A.17)\n\nProof. Since g(H0)H0\u22121 (H0 + 1)2 is bounded, by (A.15) the bound holds for A0 , H0 in\nplace of A, H. We first undo the replacement in A and write\n(A \u2212 a \u00b1 \u0131)\u22122 g(H0) = (A \u2212 a \u00b1 \u0131)\u22122 \u03c6(x)g(H0 ) + (A \u2212 a \u00b1 \u0131)\u22122 (1 \u2212 \u03c6(x))g(H0) ,\nwhere \u03c6 \u2208 C0\u221e [0, \u221e) has v(x) = x on supp(1 \u2212 \u03c6). Then \u03c6(x)g(H0 ) \u2208 J1 (see [21], Thm.\nXI.20). For the second term on the r.h.s. we write, dropping a, (A + \u0131)\u22122 (1 \u2212 \u03c6(x))(A0 +\n\u0131)2 * (A0 + \u0131)\u22122 g(H0 ). Since the last factor is trace class, we are left with showing that the\nfirst factor is bounded. This follows from\n(1 \u2212 \u03c6)(A0 + \u0131)2 = (A + \u0131)2 (1 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 (A + \u0131)[\u03c6, A0 ] \u2212 [\u03c6, A0 ](A + \u0131) ,\nwhere [\u03c6, A] = \u0131x\u03c6\u2032 (x) bounded.\nThe bound (A.16) clearly also holds for (A + \u0131)\u22122 Jg(H0 )J \u2217 = J(A + \u0131)\u22122 g(H0 )J \u2217 and\nhence, by (A.6), as claimed.\nAcknowledgments.
