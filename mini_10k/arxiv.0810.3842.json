We give a concrete example of such an\neffect.\n\nperturbative QCD and operator product expansion (OPE) allow to introduce another type of\neffective Lagrangian description, corresponding\nto the leading order in 1/NC and reflecting the\nbasic features of QCD in the NC \u2192 \u221e limit.\nNamely, the spectrum consisting of an infinite\ntower of free stable mesonic resonances exchanged\nin each channel requires infinite number of resonance fields in the U (3)L \u00d7 U (3)R symmetric\nLagrangian with interaction vertices suppressed\n\u22121/2\nby an appropriate power of NC and (since the\n1/NC expansion is correlated with semiclassical\nexpansion) only tree graphs have to be taken into\naccount in the leading order. An approximation\nto this general picture consisting in limiting the\nnumber of resonance field to one in each channel and matching the resulting theory in the high\nenergy region with OPE is known as Resonance\nChiral Theory (R\u03c7T) [5,6]. Integrating out the\nresonance fields from the Lagrangian of R\u03c7T in\nthe low energy region and subsequent matching\nwith \u03c7PT has become a very successful tool for\nestimates of the resonance contribution to the values of the O(p4 ) [5] and O(p6 ) [7,8] low energy\nconstants (LEC) entering the \u03c7PT Lagrangian.\nThough the usual chiral power counting fails\nwithin R\u03c7T due to the presence of an additional\nheavy scale (the mass of the resonances) and the\nusual Weinberg formula [1] cannot be generalized\nhere (because of the lack of a scale playing the role\n\n1. Introduction\nNon-perturbative investigation of the QCD dynamics in the low energy region by means of the\neffective Lagrangian approach has made considerable progress recently. In the very low energy region (E \u226a \u039bH \u223c 1 GeV ) the chiral perturbation\ntheory (\u03c7PT) [1,2,3] based on the spontaneously\nbroken chiral symmetry SU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R grew\ninto a very successful model-independent tool for\ndescription of the Green functions (GF) of quark\ncurrents and related low-energy phenomenology.\n\u03c7PT is organized as a rigorously defined simultaneous perturbative expansion in small momenta\nand light quark masses. Recent calculations are\nperformed at the next-to-next-to-leading order\nO(p6 ) [4].\nIn the intermediate energy region (\u039bH \u2264 E <\n2 GeV ), however, the situation is less satisfactory.\nThe set of relevant degrees of freedom includes\nnow the low lying resonances and because there\nis no mass gap existing in the spectrum, the effective theory in this region cannot be constructed\nas a straightforward extension of the \u03c7PT low\nenergy expansion. On the other hand, the considerations based on the large NC expansions together with high-energy constraints derived from\n\u2217 Presented\n\nby J. T. This work was supported in part\nby the Center for Particle Physics (project no. LC 527),\nGACR (grant no. 202/07/P249) and by the EU Contract\nNo. MRTN-CT-2006-035482, \"Flavianet\".\n\n1\n\n\fanalogous to \u039bH ), it seems to be fully legitimate\nto go beyond the tree level R\u03c7T and calculate\nthe loops [9]. Being suppressed by one power of\n1/NC , the loops allow to encompass such NLO\neffects in the 1/NC expansion as resonance widths\nand final state interaction and to determine the\nNLO resonance contribution to LEC (and their\nrunning with the renormalization scale).\nHowever, we have to be ready for both technical and conceptual complications connected with\nrenormalization of the effective theory for which\nno natural organization of the expansion (other\nthan the 1/NC counting) exists. Especially, because there is no natural analog of the Weinberg\npower counting in R\u03c7T, we can expect mixing\nof the naive chiral orders in the process of the\nrenormalization (e.g the loops renormalize the\nO(p2 ) LEC and also counterterms of unusually\nhigh chiral orders are needed). Also, lack of appropriate protective symmetry can bring about\nappearance of new poles in the GF corresponding to new degrees of freedom2 which are frozen\nat the tree level. The latter might be felt as a\npathological artefact of the not carefully enough\nformulated theory, particularly because this extra\npoles might be negative norm ghost or tachyons\n[10]. On the other hand, however, we could also\ntry to take advantage of this feature and adjust\nthe poles in such a way that they correspond to\nthe well established resonance states.\nIn the following we will illustrate these problems in more detail. As an explicit example we\nuse the one-loop renormalization of the propagator corresponding to the antisymmetric tensor\nfield which originally describes the 1\u2212\u2212 vector\nresonance (\u03c1 meson) at the tree level. We will\nshow that the loop corrections to the propagator\ncould lead to the dynamical generation of various\ntypes of 1\u2212\u2212 and 1+\u2212 states and that the appropriate adjustment of coupling constants allows us\nto generate in this way the one which could be\nidentified with the b1 (1235) meson. The details\nof the calculations and further discussion will be\nprovided in [12].\n\n2. Antisymmetric tensor field propagator\nThe 1\u2212\u2212 resonance part of the R\u03c7T Lagrangian\nwithin the antisymmetric tensor formalism reads\n[5,6]\n1\n1\nL = \u2212 hD\u03bc R\u03bc\u03bd D\u03b1 R\u03b1\u03bd i + M 2 hR\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd i + Lint ,\n4\n2\n(1)\na\nwhere R\u03bc\u03bd = R\u03bc\u03bd\nT a with normalized U (3) gena\nerators T a , R\u03bc\u03bd\nare antisymmetric tensor fields\nwith appropriate quantum numbers and D\u03b1 is the\nusual chiral covariant derivative.

Because there is no pole in\n\u2206T (p2 ) at this order, no additional 1+\u2212 state is\npropagated. Beyond LO we get generally\n\nfact we need counterterms with up to six derivatives, namely\n\n\u2206L (p2 )\u22121\n\u2206T (p2 )\u22121\n\nThe complete list of the counterterms and their\ninfinite parts is postponed to [12].

Provided such a term was included in the LO Lagrangian from the very beginning, the propagator would have an additional\npole in \u2206TLO . However, interpretation of such a\npole as a 1+\u2212 state would be problematic. According to the sign of Y this state would be either\na tachyon or a negative norm ghost [10].\nEvaluating the one-loop Feynman graphs and\nadding the polynomial contributions from the\ncounterterms (4) we get the \u03c7PT minimally subtracted self-energies \u03a3rL,T (p2 ). The equation for\nthe poles of \u2206L (p2 ) has then an approximative\nperturbative solution p2 = M 2 + \u03a3rL (M 2 ) corresponding to the original 1\u2212\u2212 vector resonance\nwith LO mass M 2 , which develops a mass correction and a finite width of the order O(1/NC )\ndue to the loops and which we identify with the\n\u03c1 meson.

However, the trilinear vertices contributing to the one-loop self-energies are\n\u22121/2\nO(NC ) in both cases due to the appropriate\n\u22121/2\npower of 1/F = O(NC ) accompanying u\u03b1 .\nTherefore the operators with two resonance fields\ncannot be eliminated using the large NC arguments. Also nonzero di are required in order to\nsatisfy the OPE constraints for VVP GF at the\nLO [13].\nIn order to cancel the infinite part of the oneloop self-energies we have to introduce a set of\ncounterterms. Because the interaction terms are\nO(p2 ) we would expect (by the analogy with\n\u03c7PT power counting) these counterterms to have\nfour derivatives at most. However, the nontrivial structure of the free resonance propagator\n(namely the presence of the \u2206TLO \u03a0T\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 part) results in the failure of this naive expectation.

These can be expressed in terms of renormalization scale independent combinations of the renormalized counterterms couplings and \u03c7logs.

The nature\nof the corresponding states, which is also controlled by the free parameters bi and \u03b3, is rich\nand covers bound states 0 < p2 < M\u03c12 , (which\nalso might be negative norm ghosts), tachyonic\npoles p2 < 0, resonance poles in the lower complex half-plane on the second sheet or even complex conjugated pair of Lee-Wick poles on the first\nsheet. It is not straightforward to formulate general conditions for bi and \u03b3 under which there\nis no pole in \u2206T (p2 ) at all, on the other hand\nwe can rather easily arrange them to obtain the\npole corresponding e.g. to the b1 (1235) meson.\nThis can be achieved in many ways e.g. for the\nchoice b0 = \u2212b1 = \u22123.52, b2 = \u22123.07, b3 = 1\nand \u03b3 = \u22120.52.
