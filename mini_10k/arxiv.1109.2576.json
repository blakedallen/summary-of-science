Introduction\nThe measurement of the W + W \u2212 production cross section at the LHC provides an important test of the Standard Model (SM) through the sensitivity to the triple gauge boson couplings that result from the non-Abelian\nstructure of the gauge symmetry group, SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y . Furthermore, non-resonant W + W \u2212 production is\nan irreducible background in searches for the Higgs boson in the same final state. Understanding the detection\nsensitivity of ATLAS to W -pair production is crucial for Higgs boson searches. The WW cross section has been\nmeasured at LHC with the ATLAS detector using limited statistics based on 2010 data (34 pb\u22121 ) [1], this paper\npresents new results with 1.02 fb\u22121 integrated luminosity collected in 2011.\nCandidate W + W \u2212 events are reconstructed in the leptonic decay channels, W \u00b1 \u2192 `\u00b1 \u03bd, where ` is an\nelectron or muon. Sequential decays to electrons and muons via \u03c4 leptons are also included as signal: W \u00b1 \u2192\n\u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bd\u03c4 \u2192 `\u00b1 \u03bd` \u03bd\u03c4 \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 . The resulting final state has two high-transverse-momentum (high-pT ) charged leptons and\nmiss\nsubstantial transverse momentum imbalance in the final state (referred to as missing transverse energy ET\n+ \u2212 miss\nbelow) due to the neutrinos or antineutrinos escaping detection. The major backgrounds for this ` ` ET\nfinal state are Drell-Yan, top quark, W +jet and diboson (W Z, ZZ and W \u03b3) production.\n\n2. The ATLAS detector and data sample\nThe ATLAS detector [2] is a multipurpose particle physics apparatus with nearly 4\u03c0 solid angle coverage.\nATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the\ncentre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the\nLHC ring, and the y axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6\nbeing the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle\n\u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)]. Closest to the beamline are inner tracking detectors which use layers of silicon-based\nand straw-tube detectors, located inside a thin superconducting solenoid that provides a 2T magnetic field,\nto measure the trajectories of charged particles within |\u03b7| < 2.5. The solenoid is surrounded by a hermetic\ncalorimeter system. A liquid argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter is divided into a central barrel calorimeter\nand two end-cap calorimeters, each housed in a separate cryostat. Fine-grained LAr electromagnetic (EM)\ncalorimeters, with excellent energy resolution, provide coverage for |\u03b7| <3.2. An iron-scintillator tile calorimeter\nprovides hadronic coverage in the range |\u03b7| <1.7. In the end-caps (|\u03b7| >1.5), LAr hadronic calorimeters match\nthe outer |\u03b7| limits of the end-cap EM calorimeters. LAr forward calorimeters provide both EM and hadronic\nenergy measurements, and extend the coverage to |\u03b7| <4.9. Outside the calorimeters is an extensive muon\nspectrometer in a toroidal magnetic field, providing precise muon measurements within |\u03b7| < 2.7. The muon\ntrigger system covers the range |\u03b7| <2.4.\nA three-level trigger system is used to select interesting events in real time. The electron trigger selects\nelectrons that deposit at least 20 GeV of transverse energy in the calorimeter. The muon trigger requirement\nconsists of a logical OR between a trigger that requires a muon detected with a transverse momentum of at least\n18 GeV and a looser quality trigger that requires a muon of at least 40 GeV in the barrel section of the muon\nspectrometer. The data used for this analysis were recorded up to June 2011 and correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of 1.02 fb\u22121 . The luminosity is determined with a relative uncertainty of 3.7% using van der Meer\nscans [3].\nMonte Carlo simulation samples are used to develop and validate the analysis procedures, to calculate the\nacceptance for W + W \u2212 events and to evaluate the contributions from some background processes.\n\n\f2\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\nFor the W + W \u2212 signal, we use the next-to-leading order (NLO) generator MC@NLO [4] in conjunction with\nthe CTEQ6.6 [5] parton distribution functions (PDF). Herwig [6] is used for W leptonic decays and for the\nparton shower simulation and hadronization. Jimmy [7] is used for the underlying event simulation. In addition,\nthe gg2ww [8] MC generator (interfaced to Herwig and Jimmy) is used to simulate the W + W \u2212 events from\nthe gluon-gluon fusion process.\nThe Drell-Yan and the W + jets backgrounds are generated with Alpgen. The top (tt\u0304 and W t) and diboson\n(W Z and ZZ) backgrounds are modeled with MC@NLO interfaced to the Herwig and Jimmy programs.\nThe single top background samples are produced with the AcerMC generator [10]. W \u03b3 is modeled using\nPythia/MadGraph [11], and hadronic multi-jet backgrounds with the Pythia generator.\nThe detector response for all the generated MC events is simulated by passing them through a detailed\nsimulation [12] of the ATLAS detector based on the GEANT4 program [13]. These simulated data samples are\nthen reconstructed, selected, and analyzed as it is done for the data.\n\n3. Object reconstruction\nBrief descriptions of the relevant physics objects used in this analysis are given in this section. These objects\nare the pp collision vertices, electrons, muons, missing transverse energy, and hadronic jets.\nThe pp collision vertices in each bunch crossing are reconstructed using the inner tracking system. To remove\ncosmic-ray and beam-induced backgrounds, we require the primary vertex to have three or more tracks.\nElectron candidates are formed by matching a cluster of energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter to a charged\ntrack found in the inner tracking system. In this analysis, we use electrons with |\u03b7| < 1.37 or 1.52 < |\u03b7| < 2.47,\nwhich avoids the transition region between the barrel and the end-cap electromagnetic calorimeters.\nWe use the ATLAS \"tight\" electron identification criteria [14]. The ET of the leading electron in the ee\nchannel and the ET of the electron in the e\u03bc channel are required to exceed 25 GeV. The sub-leading ET in\nthe ee channel must be greater than 20\np GeV. The isolation requirement is that the sum of the energy in the\ncalorimeter cells within a cone \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7)2 + (\u2206\u03c6)2 of 0.3 around the electron, excluding the energy in the\nelectron cluster and after corrections for leakage and pileup effects, must be less than 4 GeV. In addition, the\nlongitudinal impact parameter |z0 | of the track relative to the primary vertex must be smaller than 10 mm, and\nthe transverse impact parameter significance d0 /\u03c3d0 must be less than 10, where d0 and \u03c3d0 are the transverse\nimpact parameter relative to the primary vertex and its uncertainty, respectively. The electron identification\nefficiency is measured in data using control samples of Z \u2192 e+ e\u2212 and W \u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 \u03bd events. The overall electron\nselection efficiency in this analysis is about 78% for the central region (|\u03b7| < 0.8), and decreases to about 64%\nin the endcap region (2.0 < |\u03b7| < 2.47).\nMuons are reconstructed using information from the muon spectrometer, the inner tracking detectors, and\nthe calorimeters. The absolute value of the pseudorapidity |\u03b7| of the combined muon is required to be less than\n2.4. The muon transverse momentum measured by combining information from the muon spectrometer and\ninner detector systems must be greater than 20 GeV. To suppress muons originating from hadronic jets, the\nmuons must be isolated such that the pT sum of other tracks in a cone of \u2206R = 0.2 around the muon track\ndivided by the muon pT is less than 0.1. The muon reconstruction and identification efficiencies are measured\nusing Z \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 candidates in data. The overall muon reconstruction efficiency is found to be 92.8% \u00b1 1.0%\n(syst) in data with negligible statistical uncertainty.\nJets are reconstructed from calorimeter clusters using the anti-kt algorithm [15\u201317] with a jet resolution\nparameter of \u2206R = 0.4. These jets are calibrated using pT - and \u03b7-dependent correction factors [18] based on\nMC simulation, and validated by extensive test beam and collision data. The selected jets are required to have\npT > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5. The jet energy scale uncertainty depends on pT and \u03b7 and ranges from 2% - 8%\nfor pT > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5 due to calibration [18].\nThe missing transverse energy is reconstructed using calorimeter energies from clusters in the detection range\n|\u03b7| < 4.5 and muon momenta measured by the muon spectrometer and inner detector. The mis-measured\nmiss\nenergies of leptons or jets can produce false ET\n. To reduce the rate of backgrounds that arise from these\nmiss\nmis-measurements, particularly the Drell-Yan background, we use a relative missing transverse energy (ET,\nRel ),\nwhich is defined as the following:\n\u001a miss\nET \u00d7 sin (\u2206\u03c6`,j ) if \u2206\u03c6 < \u03c0/2\nmiss\nET,\n=\n(1)\nmiss\nRel\nET\nif \u2206\u03c6 \u2265 \u03c0/2,\nmiss\nwhere \u2206\u03c6`,j is the difference in the azimuthal angle \u03c6 between the ET\nand the nearest lepton or jet. The\nmiss\nasymmetric requirement on ET, Rel helps to optimize the WW detection significance. This requirement also\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n3\n\nmiss\nreduces the background from Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , where the real ET\nfrom the \u03c4 semileptonic decays is parallel to the\nmomenta of the leptons.\n\n4. Event selection\nDi-lepton events are selected using the lepton identification requirements described in the previous section.\nFor each di-lepton final state (ee, or \u03bc\u03bc, or e\u03bc), we require each electron (or muon) to have ET (or pT ) >\n20 GeV, and we require exactly two leptons with opposite charges. The electron in the e\u03bc channel and the\nleading electron in the ee channel must have ET > 25 GeV. Both leptons are required to originate from the\nprimary vertex. At least one of the selected leptons is required to have fired its corresponding trigger (\"trigger\nmatching\"). The leptons must also have a minimum separation (effectively imposed by the lepton isolation\nrequirement) in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space of \u2206R > 0.3 in the ee channel and \u2206R > 0.2 in the \u03bc\u03bc and the e\u03bc channels.\nTo reduce the Drell-Yan background and the background from hadronic multi-jets, the invariant mass of the\ndilepton pair (e+ e\u2212 or \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) is required to exceed 15 GeV and is not allowed to be within \u00b115 GeV of the\nZ-mass. In addition, the invariant mass of the dilepton pair (e\u2212 \u03bc+ or e+ \u03bc\u2212 ) is required to exceed 10 GeV.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, further suppression of the remaining Drell-Yan and other backgrounds is achieved by\nmiss\nmiss\nmiss\nrequiring ET,\nRel >40 GeV for the ee channel, ET, Rel >45 GeV for the \u03bc\u03bc channel and ET, Rel > 25 GeV for\nmiss\nthe e\u03bc channel. To optimize the signal to background ratio, different ET,\nRel cuts are chosen for the different\nmiss\nchannels. The figure shows the ET, Rel distribution prior to applying the jet-veto selection criteria for the ee,\n\u03bc\u03bc and e\u03bc channels.\n\nmiss\nFigure 1: ET,\nRel distributions for the selected ee, \u03bc\u03bc and e\u03bc samples after the Z mass veto cut. Bottom right plot\nmiss\nshows the jet multiplicity after ET,\nRel cut.\n\nSuppression of the top background is accomplished by rejecting events containing jets with pT > 30 GeV and\n|\u03b7| < 4.5 (the jet-veto requirement). Figure 1 shows that the majority of the W + W \u2212 signal is in the zero-jet\nbin of the jet multiplicity distribution, while the top events populate the higher jet multiplicity bins.\n\n\f4\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\nAfter all the selection criteria are applied to the di-lepton samples, 414 W + W \u2212 candidate events remain: 74\nin the ee channel, 97 in the \u03bc\u03bc channel, and 243 in the e\u03bc channel.\nThe signal acceptance is one of the key ingredients for determining the W + W \u2212 cross section. Determining\nthis acceptance relies on detailed MC signal modeling and event selection efficiency corrections using control\ndata samples. These corrections differ by at most a few percent from unity, indicating the inherent accuracy of\nthe simulation. Detailed information on the W + W \u2212 event selection acceptance is provided below. Table I shows\nthe number of MC W + W \u2212 events passing each selection cut for the three di-lepton channels. The MC events\nshown in the table are normalized to 1.02 fb\u22121 using the SM W + W \u2212 production cross sections with q q\u0304 0 and gg\ninitial states. In order to minimize the systematic uncertainty due to initial state radiation (ISR) and jet-energy\nscale, we use control samples of Z \u2192 `+ `\u2212 data and MC to determine the jet-veto efficiency correction factor\nMC\ndata MC\nto the W + W \u2212 selection [19]: \u000fdata\n/\u000fZ = 0.99 \u00b1 0.05 (syst). The two efficiency\nW W = \u000fW W \u00d7 fZ , with fZ = \u000fZ\ndata\nMC\nnumbers, \u000fZ and \u000fZ , are the fraction of the Z events with zero jets found in data and MC, respectively. The\nmain contributions to the given systematic uncertainty are due to factorisation and renormalisation scale choice\nevaluated using MC@NLO and MCFM [20]. The overall event selection acceptances for signal events are 5.0%\nfor e\u03bde\u03bd, 8.9% for \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd, and 12.6% for e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd events.

The overall systematic\nuncertainty in the W + W \u2212 selection acceptance is 6.8% for the combination of the three di-lepton channels.\nThis overall uncertainty includes the uncertainties due to lepton identification (4.2%), the jet-veto (4.8%),\nmiss\nuncertainty (2.2%) and the uncertainties of the PDFs used in MC modeling (1.3%).

Background estimation\nThe main backgrounds for the W + W \u2212 signal come from Drell-Yan events, top (tt\u0304 and single top), W +jets,\nand diboson (W Z, ZZ, W \u03b3 and Z\u03b3) production, as described in this section.\nDrell-Yan events (Z/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 `+ `\u2212 ), like W + W \u2212 events, produce two high pT leptons. Much of this background\nmiss\nis removed by the di-lepton invariant mass cuts and ET,\nRel cuts. Given the relatively large cross section of the\nDrell-Yan process, it contributes a non-negligible background to the W + W \u2212 signal due to energy/momentum\nmis-measurements of the two leptons or as a result of hadronic activity in the rest of the event. Extra pileup\ncollisions are a significant contribution to this hadronic activity.\nThe Drell-Yan backgrounds are determined from MC events generated with Alpgen and passed through the\nATLAS detector simulation. The systematic uncertainties are determined using a data-driven method which\nmiss\ncompares the ET,\nRel distributions in data and MC within the Z peak region. The distributions are found to be\nconsistent within statistical uncertainties. As a conservative estimate of the systematic, the observed difference\nis added in quadrature with the statistical uncertainty. This systematic uncertainty is applied to the background\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n5\n\nmiss\nmiss \u00b1 \u2213 miss\nSources\ne+ e\u2212 ET\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 E T\ne \u03bc ET\nLuminosity\n3.7%\n3.7%\n3.7%\nCross-section (theory)\n5%\n5%\n5%\nPDF\n1.2%\n1.4%\n1.4%\nTrigger\n1.0%\n1.0%\n1.0%\nLepton pT smearing\n0.2%\n0.1%\n0.1%\nReco eff. scale factors\n1.4%\n0.0%\n0.7%\nET /pT scale correction\n0.9%\n0.0%\n0.4%\nParticle ID eff. scale factors\n3.3%\n1.4%\n1.6%\nIsolation\n4.0%\n2.0%\n3.0%\nmiss\nET, Rel in-time contribution\n3.5%\n3.9%\n1.4%\nmiss\nET,\n0.5%\n0.5%\n0.3%\nRel out-of-time contribution\nJet-veto\n4.8%\n4.8%\n4.8%\nTotal experimental uncertainty\n8.1%\n6.7%\n6.2%\nOverall uncertainty\nfor WW signal estimation\n10.3%\n9.2%\n8.9%\n\nTable II: Uncertainty sources and associated relative uncertainties for WW signal for the ee, e\u03bc and \u03bc\u03bc channels.\n\npredictions from MC. With the assumptions that the mechanism that causes a discrepancy between data and\nMC is independent of the invariant mass of the two leptons, and that any discrepancy between data and MC\nis caused by a mis-modeling of the Drell-Yan sample, a systematic uncertainty of 10.4% for the Drell-Yan\nbackground estimation from the MC simulation is determined. The estimated Drell-Yan backgrounds together\nwith statistical and systematic uncertainties are shown in Table III.\nAfter removing the largest background from Z/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 `+ `\u2212 events in di-lepton samples, the dominant background is from tt\u0304 and W t, followed by the leptonic decays of two real W bosons. This background can be\neffectively suppressed by requiring that there are no jets with pT > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5. However, some top\nevents containing only jets with pT less than 30 GeV can still mimic the SM W + W \u2212 events.\nThe top backgrounds in the final W + W \u2212 selection are estimated using a data driven method which is crosschecked with the Monte Carlo simulation. In this method, the top background in the zero jet bin is estimated\nusing the number of observed events in the N -jet bins (where N \u2265 2) in data and the ratio of zero-jet events over\nzero\u2212jet\n\u22652\u2212jets\nzero\u2212jet\n\u22652\u2212jets\nthe number of N -jet events in MC, Ntop\n(estimate) = Ndata\n\u00d7 (NMC\ntop /NMC top ). The uncertainties on\nluminosity and on the top cross sections cancel out in the MC ratio. A second method uses a top control sample\nselected using b-tagging to estimate the top contribution. Both data-driven methods give top background yields\nconsistent with MC and with each other. The final top background estimated is 58.6 \u00b1 2.1(stat)\u00b122.3(syst)\nevents, the systematic uncertainty is dominated by the jet-energy scale uncertainty (37%).\nW bosons produced in association with a hadronic jet give rise to W + W \u2212 backgrounds when the jet is\nmisidentified as a lepton. The rate at which hadronic jets are misidentified as leptons may not be accurately\ndescribed in the MC. The W + jets background is therefore determined from data. The W + jet background\nis estimated by defining a control region, similar to the W + W \u2212 signal selection, that is enriched in W+jet\nevents. The W + jet control region is defined using an alternative lepton definition that is rich in hadronic\njets. Jet-rich electrons are defined as isolated electromagnetic clusters matched to a track in the inner detector\nthat fail the medium [14] electron identification requirements. Jet-rich muons are defined as \"combined\" muons\nthat pass a looser isolation requirement and fail the muon selection. Events containing one fully identified\nlepton and a jet passing this jet-rich lepton definition are selected. These events are then required to pass\nthe full W + W \u2212 event selection, where the jet is treated as if it were a fully identified lepton. The W + jets\nbackground is estimated by scaling the control sample (NW +jet ) by a measured fake factor. The fake factor (f )\nis defined as the ratio of the rate at which jets satisfy the full lepton identification to the rate at which they\nsatisfy the jet-enriched lepton selection. The fake factor is measured in a di-jet data sample, parametrized as\na function of lepton pT , and is found to be 0.02 (0.25) for electrons (muons) in the 30-40 GeV region. The\nW + jets background is determined as NW +jet \u00d7 f . Samples with same sign di-leptons are also enhanced in\nW + jets events and are used as a control sample, with looser lepton identification, to cross check the method\ndescribed above. The W + jets prediction based on the fake factor method agrees well with the observed same\nsign di-lepton data. The W + jets background estimation in the W + W \u2212 signal region is given in Table III for\nthe three di-lepton channels. The statistical uncertainty is due to the limited statistics in the W + jet control\n\n\f6\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\nregions. The systematic uncertainty is due to the uncertainty on the determination of f . The uncertainty on f\nis about 30% for both electrons and muons, and is determined by the measured variations of f in different run\nperiods and in data samples containing jets of different energies. The assigned systematic uncertainty covers\nvariation of the quark/gluon composition of the jets in the jet data sample compared to jets in the W + jets\nsample, and the effects of changing instantaneous luminosity on f . The total W + jets contribution to the final\nselected W W candidate events is estimated to be 50.5 \u00b1 4.8(stat)\u00b114.7(syst).\nOther backgrounds to W + W \u2212 originate from the diboson processes W Z, ZZ and W +\u03b3. The leptonic decays\nof W Z and ZZ events can mimic the W + W \u2212 signal when one or more of the charged leptons is not reconstructed\nmiss\nand instead contributes to ET\n. The ZZ \u2192 ``\u03bd\u03bd process is suppressed by the Z veto cut. The W \u03b3 process\nis a background only for the ee and e\u03bc channels, since the probability for a photon to be misidentified as a\nmuon is negligible. These diboson background contributions are estimated using MC simulations (MC@NLO\nfor W Z, Pythia for ZZ and Pythia/MadGraph for W + \u03b3). The total diboson background contribution is\nestimated to be 6.8 \u00b1 0.4 (stat) \u00b1 0.8 (syst) events for 1.02 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity. The quoted systematic\nuncertainty includes uncertainties in the luminosity (3.7%), the SM diboson cross-sections (5%), the jet veto\nmiss\nuncertainty (2.2%). The\nefficiency (9.6%), the di-lepton trigger and identification efficiencies (4.5%) and ET\n+\n\u2212\nhadronic dijets background contribution is negligible in the W W signal region as determined by Pythia\nMC and cross-checked by data.\n\n6.

The\nstatistical uncertainty is determined from the likelihood fit, and the systematic uncertainty of our measurement\nis 13.4%, which includes the signal acceptance uncertainty (\u2206\u000fW W /\u000fW W ) of 6.8% and the uncertainty on\nthe background estimation p\n(\u2206Nbkg /(Nobs \u2212 Nbkg )) of 11.5%.

The systematic uncertainties on the\ncross section measurements from each dilepton channel are listed in Table IV. The luminosity contributes 3.7%\nsystematic uncertainty to the cross-section measurements and it is listed separately in the table.

AW W denotes the acceptance for\nthe W + W \u2212 decays under consideration (including \u03c4 \u2192 e/\u03bc + \u03bd\u03bd decays), defined as the fraction of decays\nsatisfying the geometrical and kinematical constraints at the generator level (fiducial acceptance). It is defined\nhere after the decay leptons emit photons via QED final state radiation; photons within a \u2206R < 0.1 cone\nare added back to the decay leptons (\"dressed\" leptons). CW W denotes the ratios between the total number\nof generated events which pass the final selection requirements after reconstruction and the total number of\ngenerated events within the fiducial acceptance. This corrections factor includes the efficiencies for triggering,\nreconstructing, and identifying the W + W \u2212 decays falling within the acceptance. The systematic uncertainty\nof AW W is about 6.9%. It includes the parton distribution function uncertainty (1.2% for ee, 1.4% for \u03bc\u03bc and\ne\u03bc), the renormalization and factorization scales uncertainty (5.3% for ee, 4.4% for e\u03bc and 1.5% for \u03bc\u03bc) and the\nuncertainty due to the parton shower/fragmentation modeling difference between MC@NLO and MCFM NLO\nMC generators (4.8%). The MC scale uncertainty was evaluated using MC samples where the normalization\nand the factorization scales were changed to one half and to twice their nominal value.\nThe overall W + W \u2212 event selection efficiency can be presented as AW W \u00d7 CW W . Using the overall efficiencies for different channels shown in Table I, we can determine the CW W once the AW W are determined.\nThe systematic uncertainties from various sources for CW W are listed in Table II. The systematic uncertainty\nassociated with the jet-veto cut, 4.8%, is replaced by a 4.5% JES uncertainty term. The systematic uncertainty\non CW W related to changes in the normalization and factorization scales is 1.9% in the ee channel, 2.9% in\nthe e\u03bc channel, and 5.1% in the \u03bc\u03bc channel. A total cross section measurement requires the evaluation of the\nsystematic on AW W \u00d7 CW W , for which the systematics on AW W and CW W partially overlap.
