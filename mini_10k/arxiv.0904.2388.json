Using the Very Large Array, we observed the nuclear\nregion of M82 at several epochs at 22 GHz and detected a new bright radio source in this galaxy's central region. We find a flux\ndensity for this flaring source that is \u223c 300 times larger than the upper limits determined in previous observations. The flare must have\nstarted between 2007 October 29 and 2008 March 24. Over the past year, the flux density of this new source has decreased from \u223c100\nmJy to \u223c11 mJy. The lightcurve (based on only three data points) can be fitted better with an exponential decay than with a power\nlaw. Based on the current data we cannot identify the nature of this transient source. However, a new radio supernova seems to be the\nmost natural explanation. With its flux density of more than 100 mJy, it is at least 1.5 times brighter than SN1993J in M81 at the peak\nof its lightcurve at 22 GHz.\nKey words. (Stars:) supernovae: general, Radio continuum: general, Galaxies: individual: M82\n\n1. Introduction\nM82 is a nearby (3.6 Mpc based on a Cepheid distance to M81\nby Freedman et al. 1994) irregular (I0) galaxy with a very active starburst in its nuclear region. It harbors many bright supernova remnants in its central region, which have been studied extensively for decades (Muxlow et al. 1994; Beswick et al.\n2006; Fenech et al. 2008). van Buren & Greenhouse (1994) estimate a supernova rate of 0.1 year\u22121 . However, a new radio supernova has not been discovered. Singer et al. (2004) reported\na supernova in M82 (SN2004am) that was classified as type-II\n(Mattila et al. 2004), but it has not been detected at radio wavelengths (Beswick et al. 2004).\nKronberg & Sramek (1985) and Kronberg et al. (2000) monitored the flux densities of 24 radio sources in M82 from\n1980 until 1992. Most sources (75%) remained surprisingly\nconstant. There is some controversy about how the fluxes of\nthese compact radio sources can be stable. Models of supernova remnants expanding into a dense medium may explain\nthis (Chevalier & Fransson 2001). Seaquist & Stankovi\u0107 (2007)\nargue that the radio emission could arise from wind-driven\nbubbles. Studying the evolution of a young source could be\nvery important for understanding these models. The strongest\nsource, 41.9+58.0, shows an exponential decay with a decay\nrate of \u03c4d =11.9 years (Kronberg et al. 2000). Another source,\n41.5+597, which was detected in 1981 with a flux density of\n\u223c10 mJy, faded within a few months to a flux density below 1\nmJy (Kronberg & Sramek 1985; Kronberg et al. 2000). The nature of this strongly variable source was never clarified.\nRadio supernova are rare events. So far only about two\ndozen have been detected (Weiler et al. 2002) and most of them\n\nwere quite distant and rather weak. This makes it difficult to\nstudy them in great detail. One notable exception is SN1993J\n(Schmidt et al. 1993) in M81, which has been studied extensively (Marcaide et al. 1997, 2009; Bietenholz et al. 2001, 2003;\nP\u00e9rez-Torres et al. 2001, 2002; Bartel et al. 2002, 2007). Thus,\nthe detection of a new nearby supernova would be highly desirable.\nM82 is part of the M81 group of galaxies and it shows clear\nsigns of tidal interaction with M81 and NGC 3077 (Yun et al.\n1994). This makes the M81 group an ideal system for studying galaxy interaction in great detail. With this motivation,\nwe have initiated a project to measure the proper motions of\nM81 and M82 with VLBI astrometry. We are observing M81*,\nthe nuclear radio source in M81, bright water masers in M82,\nand three compact background quasars. Based on our experience with measurements of proper motions in the Local Group\n(Brunthaler et al. 2005b, 2007), we expect a detection of the tangential motions of M81 and M82 relative to the Milky Way\nwithin a few years. So far, we have observed at three epochs\nat 22 GHz with the High Sensitivity Array (including the Very\nLong Baseline Array, the Very Large Array, and the Greenbank\nand Effelsberg telescopes). Here, we report the detection of a\nnew transient source in M82 based on the data from the NRAO1\nVery Large Array (VLA).\n\n1\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the\nNational Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by\nAssociated Universities, Inc.\n\n\f2\n\nBrunthaler et al.: Discovery of a bright radio transient in M82: a new radio supernova?\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nM82 was observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) as part\nof the High Sensitivity Array observation under projects BB229\nand BB255 on 2007 January 28, 2008 May 03, and 2009 April\n08. The total observing time in each epoch was 12 hours. We\nused M81* as phase calibrator and switched between M81*,\nM82, and 3 extragalactic background quasars every 50 seconds\nin the cycle M81* \u2013 0945+6924 \u2013 M81* \u2013 0948+6848 \u2013 M81*\n\u2013 M82 \u2013 1004+6936 \u2013 M81*, yielding an integration time of\n\u223c100 minutes on M82. We observed with two frequency bands\nof 50 MHz, each in dual circular polarization. The data reduction was performed with the Astronomical Image Processing\nSystem (AIPS) and involved standard steps. On 2007 January\n28 and 2009 April 08, we used 3 C48 as flux density calibrator.\nM81* was used as a gain and phase calibrator and one round\nof phase self-calibration was performed on M82. Unfortunately,\nno flux density calibrator was observed on 2008 May 03. Here,\nwe assumed a flux density of 150 mJy for the highly variable\nsource M81*. This value was chosen since it was in the range\nof typical values at cm wavelenghts (e.g. Brunthaler et al. 2006)\nand it yielded flux densities for 0945+6924, 1004+6936, and\n44.0+59.6 in M82 that were consistent with their flux densities\nat the other two epochs.\nM82 was also observed on 2008 March 24 with the VLA at\n22 GHz for 10 minutes (\u223c6 minutes integration time on M82) in\nspectral line mode. 3C 48 was used as flux density calibrator, and\n1048+717 was used as gain and phase calibrator. A total bandwidth of 9.18 MHz was observed. We also analyzed the archival\nVLA data of 2007 October 29 at 4.8 GHz, which is the latest\navailable data before our observations. Here, 3C 286 was used\nas flux density calibrator and 1048+717 was used as phase calibrator. Eighteen minutes of integration time on M82 was spread\nover 1.5 hours.\n\n3. Results\nA new bright source was detected on 2008 May 03 (see Fig. 1,\nmiddle and Fig. 2, bottom). With its flux density of \u223c 90 mJy,\nit was clearly the brightest radio source in the field (at least\nfive times brighter than the second brightest source). Almost\none year later, on 2009 April 08, the source had faded to a\nflux density of \u223c 11 mJy, i.e. losing almost 90% of its flux\ndensity (see Fig. 1, bottom). We estimated its position to be\n\u03b1 J2000 =09h 55m 51.551 s \u00b1 0.008 s \u03b4 J2000 =69\u25e6 40\u2032 45.792\u2032\u2032 \u00b1 0.005\u2032\u2032.\nFollowing the traditional convention of previous papers naming a source after the position offset to \u03b1B1950 =09h 55m and\n\u03b4B1950 =69\u25e6 40\u2032 , our new detection would be 42.82+59.54. The\npositions in the two observations are consistent and the uncertainty was estimated by comparing the position of another\nclearly identified source (44.0+59.6) with the positions from observations with the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer\nNetwork (MERLIN) by Muxlow et al. (1994).\nTo constrain the start time of the flare, we reduced two earlier\nVLA observations of M82. The spectral line observation on 2008\nMarch 24 had lower quality, since we observed with a narrow\nbandwidth and had only \u223c6 minutes integration time on M82.\nNevertheless, we could easily confirm the detection of the new\nsource at the same position with a similar but slightly higher\nflux density as in the 2008 May 03 observation. Next, we analyzed 4.8 GHz data from 2007 October 29. Here, no bright point\nsource was discovered (see Fig. 1, top), so we conclude that the\nstart of the flare was between 2007 October 29 and 2008 March\n24. However, it is possible that the source could be highly self-\n\nabsorbed early in its development and thus might have been detectable at high frequencies, but not at 4.8 GHz. In this case, the\nflare might have started earlier, but not earlier than 2007 January\n28 (the day of our first 22 GHz observation, see Fig. 2, top).\nThe comparision of flux densities from different epochs in\nM82 is difficult due to the diffuse emission, in particular when\ncomparing observations with different spatial resolutions. In\nTable 1, we list the flux densities of the new source along with\nthe flux densities of one additional source in M82 (44.0+59.6),\nM81*, and three background quasars.\n\n4. Pre-flare observations at other wavelengths\nMatsumoto et al.

These images, taken on 1999\nOctober 28 and 2000 January 20, show a total of 9 sources\nwithin this area, some of which are highly variable. They\ndo not find a counterpart to our new radio source. Neither\ndo Kong et al. (2007) in a total of 12 datasets of a similar\nsized region taken with the Chandra HRC and Advanced CCD\nImaging Spectrometer Array (ACIS-1 and -2) taken between\n1999 September 20 and 2005 August 18. These authors also\npresent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) H\u2212band (1.6 \u03bcm) imaging of the region with the Near-Infrared Camera and MultiObject Spectrometer (NICMOS) that, again, does not show a\ncounterpart to our variable radio source.\nK\u00f6rding et al. (2005) observed M82 with the VLA at 8.4\nGHz eight times between 2003 June and October in order to\ndetect possible radio flares from several ultraluminous X-ray\nsources (ULX). No significant emission was found at the position of our new detection above a noise level of 70 \u03bcJy at each\nepoch. A very sensitive eight-day integration of M82 at 5 GHz\nwavelength was performed with MERLIN between 2002 April\n1 and 28 (Fenech et al. 2008). The resulting 40 millarcsecond\nresolution images show no significant emission at the position\nof our new source above the rms noise level of 17 \u03bcJy beam\u22121 .\nTsai et al. (2009) present a 7 mm map from the VLA from 2005\nApril 22, with no detection of more than 0.3 mJy at the position\nof our source.\n\n5. Discussion\nThe most straightforward explanation for this new source is a\nnew radio supernova. A quantitative analysis of the lightcurve is\ndifficult due to the small number of data points (3) we obtained\nwith different angular resolutions, the complication of diffuse\nemission in M82, and the uncertain absolute flux scale in our\nobservation of 2008 May 03. We extracted the flux d ensities of\nour source by restricting the interferometer (u,v)-data to >30 k\u03bb\nto remove most of the extended emission (Table 1).\nWe fitted the lightcurve of the source with an exponential decay: S(t)=S0 e(t0 \u2212t)/\u03c4d . This yields a decay timescale of\n\u03c4d =0.46\u00b10.03 yr (Fig. 3). Since we do not know the exact time\nof the onset of the flare, t0 , we get values of S0 between 110 and\n270 mJy for t0 between 2008 March 24 and 2007 October 29.\nFor the fit, we added in quadrature the difference between peak\nand integrated flux density as one error estimate and systematic\n(flux density scale) errors of 5% for the first and third epochs,\nand 10% for the second epoch, where no proper flux density\ncalibrator was observed.

We also fitted a\nsimple exponential decay to the 22 GHz lightcurve of SN199J\nin M81. Here we used the first year of data after the peak in\nthe lightcurve published in Weiler et al. (2007). The fit yields\n\u03c4d =0.72\u00b10.09 yr, indicating that the new source in M82 decays\nfaster than SN1993J.\nA power-law fit (S(t)\u221d(t0 -t)\u03b1 ) is not consistent with the\nlightcurve of the new source in M82 (\u03c72pd f = 5 \u2212 8, for t0 between 2007.8 and 2008). If one allows an earlier t0 (e.g., if the\nsource is highly self-absorbed at lower frequencies), the powerlaw fit improves (\u03c72pd f = 2, for t0 =2007.08, one day after our\n2007 January 28 observation).\nThe position of the new source is marginally consistent with\nthe position of the kinematic center of M82 (Weliachew et al.\n1984). This raises the possibility that, rather than a supernova,\nwe could have detected a flare from a supermassive black hole\nin the center of M82. Flares in AGN sources can often be fitted\nwith exponential decays (Valtaoja et al. 1999). For example, a\nstrong radio flare in 1999 in the Seyfert galaxy III Zw 2 has a\ndecay rate of \u03c4d =0.73 year (Brunthaler et al. 2005a).\nOther explanations, such as luminous flares from quiescent supermassive black holes induced by a close passage of\na star that is torn apart by tidal forces, are also possible.\nHowever, such flares show a power-law decay with \u03b1 = \u22125/3\n(Evans & Kochanek 1989; Ayal et al. 2000; Gezari et al. 2009),\nwhich is not consistent with our lightcurve.\nHowever, M82 has never shown evidence of a nuclear supermassive black hole (which would be surprising for a small\nirregular galaxy). Since the progenitor for our flare showed no\nX-ray emission, a stellar or intermediate mass black hole is also\nnot probable. Thus, based on the current data, a new radio supernova seems to be the most likely explanation.\nAcknowledgements. We thank the referee Dr. K.

Contour values are -4, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128,\n256, and 512 times 0.2 mJy beam\u22121 , roughly the (comparable)\nrms noise level in both images. The star symbols mark the positions of the x-ray sources discussed by Matsumoto et al. (2001)\nand in the top panel bear these authors' nomenclature. The asterisk gives the position of the radio kinematic center (R.K.C.)\nof M82 as determined by Weliachew et al. (1984). Both images\nwere restored with a circular beam of 1.5 arcseconds. Since the\nobservation on 2007 January 28 was made in C configuration,\nthere was much more data from short baselines, which results in\nbetter sensitivity to extended emission.\n\n\fBrunthaler et al.: Discovery of a bright radio transient in M82: a new radio supernova?\n\nPeak flux density [mJy/beam]\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n2008.2\n\n2008.4\n\n2008.6\n\n2008.8\n\n2009\n\n2009.2\n\n2009.4\n\nDate [years]\n\nFig. 3.
