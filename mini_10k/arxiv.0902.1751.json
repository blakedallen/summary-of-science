In these systems the\ntides are thought to spin up the stars to rapid rotation, synchronous with their orbital revolution. We use a state-of-the-art stellar\nevolution code including the effect of rotational mixing, tides, and magnetic fields. We adopt a rotational mixing efficiency that has\nbeen calibrated against observations of rotating stars under the assumption that rotational mixing is the main process responsible for\nthe observed surface abundances.\nWe find that the primaries of massive close binaries (M1 \u2248 20 M\u2299 , Porb . 3 days) are expected to show significant enhancements in\nnitrogen (up to 0.6 dex in the Small Magellanic Cloud) for a significant fraction of their core hydrogen-burning lifetime.

Introduction\nThe rotation rate is considered as one of the main initial stellar parameters, along with mass and metallicity, which determine the fate of single stars. Rotation deforms the star to an\noblate shape (of which Achernar is an extreme example, see\nDomiciano de Souza et al. 2003), it interplays with the mass\nloss from the star (e.g. Friend & Abbott 1986; Langer 1998;\nMaeder & Meynet 2000a) and it induces instabilities in the interior leading to turbulent mixing in otherwise stable layers (e.g.\nMeynet & Maeder 1997). As rotationally induced mixing can\nbring processed material from the core to the surface, it has\nbeen proposed as explanation for observed surface abundance\nanomalies, such as a nitrogen enrichment found in several massive main-sequence stars (e.g. Walborn 1976; Maeder & Meynet\n2000b; Heger & Langer 2000). In models of rapidly rotating\nmassive stars, rotational mixing can efficiently mix the centrally\nproduced helium throughout the stellar envelope. Instead of expanding during core H burning as non-rotating models do, they\nstay compact, become more luminous and move blue-wards in\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This type of evolution is commonly referred to as (quasi-)chemically homogeneous evolution\n\n(Maeder 1987; Yoon & Langer 2005). Some over-luminous O\nand WNh1 in the Magellanic Clouds in the Magellanic Clouds\nhave been put forward as examples pf this type of evolution\n(Bouret et al. 2003; Walborn et al. 2004; Mokiem et al. 2007;\nMartins et al. 2008). This alternative evolutionary scenario has\nbeen proposed as a way to create rapidly rotating massive helium\nstars as the possible progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts within\nthe collapsar scenario (Yoon & Langer 2005; Woosley & Heger\n2006; Cantiello et al. 2007).\nMultiple attempts have been made to constrain the efficiency\nof rotational mixing (e.g. Gies & Lambert 1992; Fliegner et al.\n1996; Daflon et al. 2001; Venn et al. 2002; Korn et al. 2002;\nHuang & Gies 2006; Mendel et al. 2006), but often these attempts remained inconclusive due to limited sample sizes or a\nstrong bias towards stars with low projected velocities. The VLTFLAMES survey provided, for the first time, a large sample of\nmassive stars with accurate abundance determinations, covering a wide range of projected rotational velocities (Evans et al.\n2005; Hunter et al. 2008). This sample was used to calibrate the\n1\nWolf-Rayet stars with evidence of enhanced nitrogen and hydrogen\nin their spectra (e.g. Schnurr et al. 2008)\n\n\f2\n\nS. E. de Mink, M. Cantiello, N. Langer, et al.: Rotational mixing in massive binaries:\n\nefficiency of rotational mixing, under the assumption that rotational mixing is the main process responsible for the observed\nenhancements (Brott et al. 2009).\nThese authors performed a population synthesis, based on\ndetailed models of rotating single stars, to reproduce the properties of the VLT-FLAMES sample. They find that their models\ncannot account for a large number (20% of the sample) of highly\nnitrogen-enriched, slow rotators and a group of evolved fast rotators which are relatively non-enriched (a further 20% of the\nsample). This raises the question whether other processes play\nan important role in explaining the nitrogen enhancements of\nmassive main-sequence stars, such as mass transfer in binaries\n(Langer et al. 2008).\nRegardless of the successes of rotating stellar models to explain a variety of stellar phenomena (Maeder & Meynet 2000b),\nrotational mixing is still a matter of debate. Clearly a conclusive\nobservational test for the concept of rotational mixing is needed.\nIn this paper we propose to use eclipsing binaries for this purpose.\nEclipsing binaries have frequently been used to test stellar\nevolution models as they provide accurate stellar masses, radii\nand effective temperatures. Even beyond our own Galaxy, in the\nMagellanic Clouds, stellar parameters of O and early B stars\nhave been determined with accuracies of 10% (Harries et al.\n2003; Hilditch et al. 2005), which have been used to test binary\nevolution models (e.g. De Mink et al. 2007). As rotational mixing is more important in more massive stars (e.g. Heger et al.\n2000), it is a major advantage to know the stellar masses for\nquantitative testing of the efficiency of rotational mixing.\nIn close binaries with orbital periods Porbit less than a few\ndays, the tides are so strong that the stars rotate synchronously\nwith the orbital motion: Pspin = Porbit . With stellar radii known\nfrom eclipse measurements, this enables us to determine the rotational velocity directly from the orbital period. This is the second important advantage of using binaries for testing rotational\nmixing with respect to single stars. For single stars fitting of\nspectral lines allows only for the determination of 3 sin i, where\n3 is the rotational velocity at the equator and i the inclination of\nthe rotation axis, which is generally not known.\nHere, we propose to use eclipsing binaries, consisting of two\ndetached main-sequence stars. Detailed calculations of binary\nevolution show that if one of the stars fills its Roche lobe during the main sequence, it does not detach again before hydrogen\nis exhausted in the core, except maybe for a very short thermal\ntimescale (Wellstein et al. 2001; De Mink et al. 2007). Turning\nthis around we find that, in a binary with two detached mainsequence stars, we can safely exclude the occurrence of previous mass transfer. In other words, the fact that a system consists\nof two detached main-sequence stars, constrains the evolutionary history. In contrast, for a fast rotating apparently single star\nwe do not know whether the star was born as a rapidly rotating\nsingle star, or whether the rapid rotation is the result of mass\ntransfer in a binary or of a binary merger. The companion, if still\npresent, may be very hard to detect, being a faint low-mass star\nin a wide orbit2 .\nIf the spectra of a binary are of high quality, one can determine the surface abundances of the two components (e.g.\nLeushin 1988; Pavlovski & Hensberge 2005; Rauw et al. 2005).\nThese surface abundances, together with accurate determinations of the stellar parameters and the orbital period have the po2\n\nAbundance determinations of boron, if available, may be used\nto distinguish between binary effects and pure rotational mixing, see\nFliegner et al. (1996)\n\ntential of strongly constraining the efficiency of rotational mixing.\nThe evolution of close massive binaries has been modeled by various groups (e.g. Podsiadlowski et al. 1992;\nPols 1994; Wellstein et al. 2001; Wellstein & Langer 1999;\nNelson & Eggleton 2001; Belczynski et al. 2002; Petrovic et al.\n2005a; Vanbeveren et al. 2007; De Mink et al. 2007, and references therein). In this work we use a detailed binary evolution\ncode to predict the surface abundances for massive detached\nclose binaries. In addition we discuss models of very massive\nclose binaries, in which rotational mixing can be so efficient that\nthe change in chemical profile leads to changes in the stellar\nstructure.\n\n2. Stellar evolution code\nWe model the evolution of rotating massive stars using the 1D\nhydrodynamic stellar evolution code described by Yoon et al.\n(2006) and Petrovic et al. (2005b), which includes the effects\nof rotation on the stellar structure and the transport of angular momentum and chemical species via rotationally induced\nhydrodynamic instabilities (Heger et al. 2000). The rotational\ninstabilities considered are: dynamical shear, secular shear,\nEddington-Sweet circulation and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke\ninstability (Heger et al. 2000). Two processes dominate rotational mixing in massive stars: Eddington-Sweet circulation,\nlarge-scale meridional currents resulting from the thermal imbalance between pole and equator characteristic of rotating stars\n(von Zeipel 1924; Eddington 1925, 1926; Vogt 1925) and shear\nmixing, eddies, that can form between two layers of the star rotating at different angular velocity (e.g. Zahn 1974). We take\ninto account angular momentum transport by magnetic torques\nas proposed by Spruit (2002) as these can successfully provide\nthe coupling between the stellar core and envelope necessary to\nexplain the observed spins in young compact stellar remnants\n(Heger et al. 2005; Petrovic et al. 2005b; Suijs et al. 2008).\nMixing of chemical species and the transport of angular momentum are implemented as diffusion processes. For convection\nwe assume a mixing length parameter \u03b1MLT = 1.5. In semiconvective regions we assume efficient mixing (\u03b1SEM = 1.0, as\ndefined in Langer 1991). The turbulent viscosity is determined\nas the sum of the convective and semi-convective diffusion coefficients and those that arise from the rotationally induced instabilities. The inhibiting effect of gradients in the mean molecular\nweight on rotational mixing is decreased by a factor f\u03bc = 0.1\n(Yoon et al. 2006).\nBrott et al. (2009) calibrated the efficiency of rotationally induced mixing using data from the VLT-FLAMES survey of massive stars, assuming that rotational mixing is the main process\nresponsible for the observed enhancements. To reproduce the\nextension of the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, they assumed overshooting of 0.355 times the pressure\nscale height. The main parameter responsible for the efficiency\nof rotational mixing is fc , defined as the contribution of rotationally induced instabilities to the diffusion of chemical species\n(Heger et al. 2000). Brott et al. (2009) found that fc = 0.0228\nis needed to reproduce the spread in N abundances observed in\nthe VLT-FLAMES data (Hunter et al. 2008). We do not consider\npossible mixing by instabilities related to magnetic buoyancy\ndue to winding up of the magnetic field lines through differential rotation (Spruit 2002) as this leads to too efficient mixing\n(Hunter et al. 2008).\nMetallicity-dependent mass loss in the form of stellar winds\nhas been included as in Yoon et al. (2006); Brott et al. (2009).\n\n\fS. E. de Mink, M. Cantiello, N. Langer, et al.: Rotational mixing in massive binaries:\n\n3\n\nFor the associated angular momentum loss we assume that mass\nis lost with the specific angular momentum equal to the latitudinally averaged specific angular momentum of the surface layer.\nThe mass loss is thus assumed to be independent of latitude.\nThe effect of mass and angular momentum loss on the binary orbit is computed according to Podsiadlowski et al. (1992),\nwith the specific angular momentum of the wind calculated according to Brookshaw & Tavani (1993). We assume that the orbit is circular and that the spins of the stars are perpendicular\nto the orbital plane. Tidal interaction is modeled as described in\nDetmers et al. (2008) using the timescale for synchronization by\nturbulent viscosity (Zahn 1977), see also Section 3. Angular momentum is transported between the surface layers and the inner\nregions by magnetic torques and rotational instabilities. At the\nonset of central H burning, we assume that the rotation of the\nstars is rigid and synchronized with the orbital motion.\nInitial Composition\n\nWe discuss single stellar models starting with three different\ninitial compositions, representing the composition of the Small\nand Large Magellanic Cloud (abbreviated as SMC and LMC)\nand the Galaxy (GAL) following the approach by Brott et al.\n(2009) to which we refer for details. For C, O, Mg and Si\nwe use the average abundances determined for stars in the\nVLT-FLAMES survey (Hunter et al. 2007). For the Magellanic\nClouds we adopt the N abundance measured for HII regions\nwhich is in agreement with the lowest observed N abundances\nin the VLT-FLAMES sample (Hunter et al. 2007, and references\ntherein). For the remaining heavy elements we adopt solar abundances by Asplund et al. (2005) scaled down by 0.7 dex for the\nSMC and 0.4 dex for the LMC. For our binary models we have\nassumed the SMC composition. The opacity tables of OPAL\n(Iglesias & Rogers 1996) are adopted, where the Fe abundance\nis used to interpolate between the tables of different metallicity.\n\n3. Stellar rotation under the influence of tides\nIn a close binary, angular momentum and kinetic energy can be\nexchanged between the two stars and their orbit through tides.\nThe system tends to evolve towards a state of minimum mechanical energy due to dissipative processes. This is an equilibrium state, where the orbit is circular, the spins of the stars\nare aligned and perpendicular to the orbital plane and the stars\nare in synchronous rotation with the orbital motion, such that\nPspin = Porbit . How quickly this equilibrium state is approached\ndepends on the efficiency of the processes responsible for the\nenergy dissipation.\nThe most efficient form of energy dissipation takes place in\nturbulent regions of the star, such as convective layers, where the\nkinetic energy of the large-scale flow induced by the tides cascades down to smaller and smaller scales, until it is dissipated\ninto heat. Zahn (1977, 1989) estimated the timescale for synchronization due to this \"turbulent viscosity\" as a function of the\nratio q of the mass of the companion star to the mass of the star\nunder consideration and on the ratio of the stellar radius R over\nthe separation a between the two stars:\n\u03c4sync,turb = fturb q\u22122\n\n\u0012 R \u0013\u22126\na\n\nyear.\n\n(1)\n\nThe proportionality factor fturb depends on the structure of\nthe star, on the location of the turbulent layers and on the\ntimescale for dissipation of kinetic energy, which is uncertain.\n\nFig. 1. Timescales for tidal synchronization. The four dashed\nlines indicate where the timescales for tidal synchronization by\nturbulent viscosity \u03c4sync,turb and radiative dissipation \u03c4sync,rad for\nzero-age main-sequence stars are equal to (one percent of) the\nmain-sequence lifetime \u03c4ms of the most massive star of a binary\nsystem, see Sect. 3 for details. In the region below the grayshaded bands, tides quickly synchronize the stellar rotation with\nthe orbit. The resulting equatorial velocity in kms\u22121 for the primary star is indicated with contour levels, assuming the radius at\nthe onset of hydrogen burning. We have assumed a metallicity of\nZ=0.004 and a mass ratio M2 /M1 = 0.75, to be consistent with\nthe models presented in Sect. 4. The average velocity measured\nfor apparently single stars in the SMC, h3eq i = 175kms\u22121, is\nplotted with a dotted line. Very short orbital periods are excluded\n(hashed region) as the stars fill their Roche lobe at zero-age.\nNevertheless, the dependence of the time scale on R/a is so steep\nthat, approximating fturb \u2248 1, Zahn (1977) showed that this expression adequately explains the observed orbital period below\nwhich tides lead to synchronization.\nIn the absence of turbulent viscosity, another dissipative\nprocess is required in order to have efficient tides. If the star\ndoes not rotate synchronously, it experiences a varying gravitational potential, which triggers a large range of oscillations in\nthe star. These oscillations are damped near the stellar surface\nby radiative dissipation. Zahn (1975) derived the corresponding\ntimescale for synchronization:\n\u03c4sync,rad = frad q\u22122 (1 + q)\u22125/6\n\n\u0012 R \u0013\u221217/2\n\nyear,\n(2)\na\n\u0012 I \u0013 \u0012 GM \u0013\u22121/2\nwhere frad = 52\u22125/3 E2\n.\nMR2\nR3\nHere, M denotes the mass of the star under consideration, I its\nmoment of inertia and E2 the tidal coefficient, which is sensitive to the structure of the star, in particular to the size of the\nconvective core: E2 \u221d (Rcore /R)8 (Zahn 1977).\nThe early-type massive stars considered in this work have\nradiative envelopes (except for convective zones just below the\nsurface which contain almost no mass, e.g. Cantiello et al. 2009)\nand synchronization by radiative damping has been proposed to\nbe the most efficient dissipation mechanism. However, in fast\nrotating stars turbulence is induced by rotational instabilities\n\n\f4\n\nS. E. de Mink, M. Cantiello, N. Langer, et al.: Rotational mixing in massive binaries:\n\nand one may argue that the first timescale applies also to these\nstars (Toledano et al. 2007). In addition Witte & Savonije (1999)\nshow that in some cases resonance locking can contribute to even\nmore efficient tidal dissipation.\nIn Figure 1 we compare both synchronization timescales\nwith the main-sequence lifetime of the more massive star in a\nbinary. For this plot we have used the radii of non-rotating zeroage main sequence stars assuming a metallicity of Z = 0.004\nand a mass ratio of M2 /M1 = 0.75. For E2 we use an analytic\napproximation by Hurley et al. (2002), for the Roche-lobe radius\nwe use the analytic expression by Eggleton (1983). The diagram\nshows that in binaries with orbital periods shorter than approximately 3-5 days, the timescale for synchronization is less than\none percent of the main-sequence lifetime \u03c4MS , regardless of the\nactual process responsible for the synchronization. The resulting\nequatorial velocity of the primary star, assuming synchronous\nrotation, is given in kms\u22121 along contour lines.\nFor comparison: the average equatorial velocity for apparently single stars in the VLT-FLAMES survey with masses between 7 and 25 M\u2299 is 150 kms\u22121 for the LMC and 175 kms\u22121\nfor the SMC (Hunter et al. 2008). In most binaries tides will\nslow down the rotation of the star, but in the tightest binaries\nthe rotation rate is higher than that for average single stars. Note\nthat the binary systems of interest in this work, for which the\ncomponents have high enough equatorial velocities to show significant surface abundance changes by rotational mixing (&100150 kms\u22121 , see Sect. 4), are in the region where tides are very\nefficient, according to both prescriptions for the synchronization\ntimescale.\n\n4. Rotational mixing in single star models\nAny element produced or destroyed in the hot interior of the star\ncan in principle be used as a tracer of rotational mixing. The\namount by which the surface abundance of a particular element\nchanges depends on the location in the star where the element is\nprocessed.\nHelium is the most important element synthesized during\ncore hydrogen burning. By the time a substantial amount of helium has been formed in the stellar core, a gradient in mean\nmolecular weight has been established at the interface between\nthe core and the envelope, which has an inhibiting effect on rotationally induced mixing. Models of moderately fast rotating stars\n(with an equatorial velocity of about 170 kms\u22121 and a mass of\nabout 20 M\u2299 ) show that helium will only appear at the surface\ntowards the very end of the main-sequence evolution. In more\nmassive stars, the helium surface abundance may be significantly\nenhanced but this is partly due to the strong stellar winds. This\nmakes helium not very suitable for testing the effect of rotational\nmixing.\nA better tracer for rotational mixing during the mainsequence evolution is nitrogen, which is produced in the hot interior layers on a very short time scale when carbon is converted\ninto nitrogen by CN-cycling. On a longer timescale (about 1-2\nMyr in the center of a 20 M\u2299 star) the CNO cycle comes into\nequilibrium, leading to additional N at the expense of both carbon and oxygen. Rotational mixing can bring nitrogen to the surface, resulting in a gradual increase of the nitrogen surface abundance over the main-sequence lifetime (Fig. 2). Nitrogen can\nbe measured in rotating B-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds\nwith accuracies of 0.2-0.25 dex (Hunter et al. 2008). Carbon decreases accordingly, but cannot be measured as accurately and is\ntherefore less suitable as a tracer of rotational mixing. Other elements such as boron can be used, but these are less abundant and\n\nmay be hard to detect, especially in metal-poor environments\nsuch as the Magellanic Clouds.\nRotational mixing becomes more efficient in higher-mass\nstars since radiation pressure becomes more important, which\nhelps to overcome the entropy barrier at the interface between\nthe core and the envelope. Also, the ratio of the timescale for\nmeridional circulation with respect to the main-sequence lifetime decreases with increasing mass (Yoon et al. 2006). The disadvantage of using very massive stars as test cases for rotational\nmixing is the uncertainty in their mass-loss rates. As mass loss\nexposes deeper layers of the star, enriched in N and He, it has\nqualitatively the same effect on the surface composition as rotational mixing. At lower metallicity mass loss in the form of\na radiatively driven stellar wind is reduced. Therefore, also the\nuncertainty in the mass-loss rate is less important.\nFigure 2 shows the nitrogen surface abundance as a function\nof time for rotating single stellar models of 20 M\u2299 with three\ndifferent initial compositions, representative for the relatively\nmetal-poor composition of the Small and Large Magellanic\nCloud, and for a mixture representing stars in the Galaxy. The\nequilibrium abundances for N in the center for CN- and CNOcycling are plotted as horizontal lines. The Galactic model with\nan equatorial velocity of 230 kms\u22121 shows nitrogen enhancements up to about 0.3 dex, while in the SMC model the N\nabundance increases by up to approximately 0.8 dex. The high\nC/N ratio in the Magellanic clouds is partly responsible for\nthis effect as it leads to a strong increase of N during CNcycling (Brott et al. 2009). Indeed, in the VLT-FLAMES survey,\nHunter et al. (2008) find a larger spread in N abundances for the\nstars in the Magellanic Clouds than for ones in the Galactic stars.\nWe conclude that the Magellanic Clouds are the most promising\nlocation for testing rotational mixing, as the effect of rotational\nmixing is most pronounced in the N surface abundances.\n\n5. Binary models\nIn this section we present binary evolution models calculated\nwith the same set of input physics as the single stellar models\npresented in Section 4, taking into account the effects of mass\nand angular momentum loss on the orbit and spin-orbit coupling\nby tides. We assume a composition representative of the Small\nMagellanic Cloud, which is relatively metal-poor and has a high\ncarbon to nitrogen ratio. We discuss two specific model sets: systems with a massive primary, M1 = 20 M\u2299 , in Sect. 5.1 and systems with a very massive primary, M1 = 50 M\u2299 , in Sect. 5.2.\n5.1. Massive binaries (20 M\u2299 +15 M\u2299 )\n\nWith the Small Magellanic Cloud sample of double-lined eclipsing binaries by Harries et al. (2003) and Hilditch et al. (2005) in\nmind, which contains 21 detached systems3 with orbital periods ranging from 1\u20134 days and primary masses ranging from\n7\u201323 M\u2299 , we chose to model the following binary systems. For\nthe mass of the primary component we adopt 20 M\u2299 , for the\nsecondary component 15 M\u2299 . The evolution of both stars is followed starting at the onset of central hydrogen burning, at t = 0,\nuntil the primary star fills its Roche lobe, at t = tRL . We adopt\n3\n\nPossibly only 20 systems are detached. For two of the systems an\nalternative semi-detached solution exists. For one of these systems a\ncomparison to binary evolution models including the effects of mass\ntransfer showed that the semi-detached solution was more consistent\nthan the detached solution (De Mink et al. 2007).\n\n\fS.

Surface abundances of nitrogen (14 N), carbon (12 C), boron (10 B+11 B) and the mass fraction of helium at the surface versus\ntime for a 20 M\u2299 star with a 15 M\u2299 close companion. Note the different vertical scales. The abundance of an element X is given\nrelative to hydrogen in the conventional units: log \u01eb(X) = log10 (nX /nH ) + 12, where nX and nH refer to the number fractions. The\ndifferent lines show the evolution assuming initial orbital periods of 1.1 days and between 1.2 and 3 days, with a spacing of 0.2\ndays. The tracks are plotted from the onset of central H burning until the onset of Roche-lobe overflow. See also Table 1.\ntakes to transport the nitrogen from the deeper layers, where it\nis produced, to the surface4 . The largest enhancement, 0.6 dex,\nis achieved in the 1.1 day binary. The shorter the orbital period,\nthe faster the rotation of the stars, the more efficient rotational\nmixing and the faster the surface abundances change with time.\nOn the other hand in the systems with short orbital periods the\nstars fill their Roche lobe at an earlier stage, leaving less time to\nmodify their surface abundances.\nThe typical uncertainty in the nitrogen abundance determinations for stars in the VLT-FLAMES survey is about 0.2 dex.\nTherefore, to be able to detect whether nitrogen is enhanced, it\nshould exceed the initial nitrogen abundance by 0.2 dex. The\nage at which this lower limit for detecting a surface nitrogen enhancement is exceeded is denoted as tenh in Table 1. Systems\nwith orbital periods shorter than 3 days all reach surface enhancements of 0.2 dex, at the latest just before they fill their\nRoche lobe. The time span during which the primary can be\nobserved with a surface nitrogen abundance exceeding 6.7 dex,\nlisted as tRL \u2212tenh in Table 1, is highest for the 1.4 day system, 1.5\nMyr. For detached tidally locked main-sequence binaries with\ninitial orbital periods greater than about 3 days we do not expect\ndetectable N enhancements on the basis of these models: their\n4\nWe define tdelay as the age at which the surface nitrogen abundance\nis enhanced by 0.01 dex.\n\nrotation rates and therefore the efficiency of rotational mixing is\ntoo low.\nWhile the nitrogen abundance increases, the carbon abundance decreases accordingly, see Fig. 3. It decreases by less than\n0.1 dex in our models. The changes in the mass fraction of helium at the surface are very small, just over 1% at maximum\nfor the tightest system. An element that is a very sensitive tracer\nof rotational mixing is boron. It is easily destroyed in the hotter\nlayers just below the surface. Therefore the time delay for boron,\nafter which the boron surface abundance starts to change, is very\nshort. The change in the boron surface abundance is considerable, up to 1.2 dex in the 1.4 day model. In practice it may be\nhard to measure boron due to its low overall abundance.\nThe closer the stars are to filling their Roche lobe, the higher\nis their surface N abundance. This can be turned around and may\nbe used to predict which binary systems are likely to show nitrogen surface enhancements. In Tab. 1 we indicate the Roche-lobe\nfilling factor R/RRL, defined as the radius of the primary star\nover the Roche-lobe radius, at the moment when the surface N\nenhancement exceeds the initial abundance by 0.2 dex. Based on\nthese models, we predict that the observed systems with masses\nclose to 20 and 15 M\u2299 have to fill their Roche lobes by about\n86% or more before they show detectable surface N enhancements (see Table 1 col. 5). We do note that the radii predicted by\nour models are sensitive to the assumed amount of overshooting.\n\n\fS. E. de Mink, M. Cantiello, N. Langer, et al.: Rotational mixing in massive binaries:\n\nIn the last two columns of Table 1 we indicate the rotational\nvelocity at the equator, averaged over time and at the onset of\nRoche-lobe overflow. Whereas a single star at this metallicity\nslows down its rotation rate due to its evolutionary expansion,\nthe spin periods of the stars in tidally locked binaries are nearly\nconstant because the orbit acts as an angular momentum reservoir. Therefore rotationally induced mixing is more important in\na star in a tidally locked binary than in a single star that started\nwith the same initial rotation rate. The effect is small, however,\nas the expansion mainly takes place after about 5\u20136 Myr for a\n20 M\u2299 star. Binaries with orbital periods shorter than 2 days\nfill their Roche lobe before the expansion sets in. The effect is\nstronger at higher metallicity, where angular momentum loss by\nthe stellar wind becomes important, see Sect. 6.\n\n6\n\n7\nSMC: 50M\u2299 + 25M\u2299\n\n1.7d\n1.6d\n\n5.9\n\nlog L (L\u2299)\n\n1.5d\n5.8\n\n1.8d\n2.0d\n\n2.5d\n\n3.0d\n\n3.5d\n\n4.0d\n\n5.7\n\n5.6\n\n5.5\n4.75\n\n4.7\n\n4.65\nlog Teff (K)\n\n4.6\n\n4.55\n\nExpected trends with system mass and mass ratio\n\n5.2.

In the above, we discussed models with a\nspecific choice for the primary mass and mass ratio and we only\nvaried the initial orbital period. Here we discuss how our findings are expected to change for systems with slightly different\nsystem masses and mass ratios.\nIn more massive binaries rotational mixing is more efficient,\nsuch that they will show a shorter time delay, even when measured in units of the core hydrogen-burning lifetime. Detectable\nsurface enhancements are expected to occur at an earlier stage,\nwhile the stars are further away from filling their Roche lobe.\nAt very high masses additional effects can play a role, which\nare discussed in Sect. 5.2. The secondary star in the models\ndiscussed above does not show significant surface abundance\nchanges for C, N and He. The surface boron abundance does\ndecrease by up to 0.6 dex for the 1.4 day model. In systems with\nmass ratios closer to 1, the time scale for rotational mixing becomes similar in both stars and nitrogen enhancements are expected for both stars.\nAnother effect of changing the mass ratio is that the size of\nthe Roche lobe changes. A more extreme mass ratio results in\na wider Roche lobe for the primary, if the primary mass and orbital period are kept constant. The efficiency of rotational mixing\ndoes not change, as it depends on the rotational period which is\nfixed by the orbital period. However, the star has more space\nto expand before it fills its Roche lobe. We noted above that\nthe primary stars fill their Roche lobes by at least 86% before\nthey show detectable surface N enhancements (see also Sect 6).\nThis changes to approximately 83% and 76% for mass ratios of\nq = 0.5 and q = 0.25 respectively. A bigger Roche lobe also\nleaves more time to enhance the surface abundance. This implies a greater chance of catching the system in a stage where\nthe surface abundance is significantly enhanced.\nTo summarize: the biggest surface N enhancements are expected for systems with a high-mass primary, which is close to\nfilling its Roche lobe, with a companion which has a significantly lower mass in an orbit of no more than a few days.\n\n0.5\n0.45\n0.4\n\n1.8d\n\n0.35\n2d\n\n0.3\n\n3d\n\n0.25\n\n2.5d\n\n4d\n3.5d\n\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n0.6\nXHe (center)\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nFig. 5.

In the hypothetical case that mixing would be extremely efficient throughout\nthe whole star, the surface helium abundance would be equal to\nthe central helium abundance at all time. This is indicated by\nthe dotted line. For the widest systems, the surface helium mass\nfraction is not affected by rotational mixing at all, while for the\n\n\fS. E. de Mink, M. Cantiello, N. Langer, et al.: Rotational mixing in massive binaries:\n\ntighter systems XHe reaches up to 65%. They follow the evolution of chemically homogeneous stars. Figure 5 also shows that\nfor each system, mass transfer starts before all hydrogen is converted into helium in the center. Note that the highest central He\nmass fraction when mass transfer starts is reached in the 1.7 day\nsystem (more than 80%), whereas on the basis of standard binary\nevolution theory (e.g. Kippenhahn & Weigert 1967) one would\nexpect this to occur in the widest system. This anomalous behavior is connected to the evolution of the radius, as discussed\nbelow.\nAll systems show big enhancements of nitrogen at the surface of the primary, see Fig. 6. The wider systems are enhanced\nby up to 0.9 dex. In the tight systems the enhancement reaches\nalmost 2 dex. This extreme increase is partly due to the fact that\nabundance is measured relative to hydrogen, which is significantly depleted at the surface of the primaries in the tightest\nsystems (cf. Table. 2). Also the secondary stars show nitrogen\nsurface enhancements, of up to 0.5 dex.\nEvolution of the radius\n\nThe increase of helium in the envelopes of the primary stars in\nthe tightest binaries leads to a decrease of the opacity and an increase in mean molecular weight in the outer layers, resulting in\nmore luminous and more compact stars. In Figure 7 we plot the\nstellar radii as a fraction of their Roche-lobe radii. The primary\nstars in the wider systems expand and fill their Roche lobe after about 2.5-3 Myr. Contrary to what one might expect, we find\nthat Roche-lobe overflow is delayed in tighter binaries. Whereas\nclassical binary evolution theory predicts that the primary star is\nthe first to fill its Roche lobe, we find instead that for systems\nwith Porb \u2264 1.7 days it is the less massive secondary star that\nstarts to transfer mass towards the primary. During this phase of\nreverse mass transfer from the less massive to the more massive\nstar, the orbit widens. Nevertheless we find that, if we continue\nour calculations, the two stars come into contact shortly after the\nonset of mass transfer and the stars are likely to merge.\nExpected trends with system mass and mass ratio\n\nIn more massive systems the effect of rotational mixing becomes stronger in both components. This may allow for chemically homogeneous evolution to occur in binary systems with\nwider orbits. If the mass ratio is closer to one, M2 \u2248 M1 , the\neffect of rotational mixing becomes comparable in both stars,\nand they may both evolve along an almost chemically homogeneous evolution track. In that case both stars can stay within\ntheir Roche lobe and gradually become two compact WR stars\nin a tight orbit. In a system with a more extreme mass ratio,\nM2 \u226a M1 , the secondary star will hardly evolve or expand during the core hydrogen-burning lifetime of the primary. Also in\nthis case Roche-lobe overflow may be avoided during the core\nhydrogen-burning lifetime of the primary component, leading to\nthe formation of a Wolf-Rayet star with a main-sequence companion in a tight orbit. The parameter space in which this type\nof evolution can occur will be examined in a subsequent paper.\n\n6. Discussion\nWe have shown that rotational mixing can have important effects in close massive binaries. The mixing parameters in our\ncode have been calibrated against observations of rotating massive stars in the VLT-FLAMES survey under the assumption that\n\n9\n\nrotational mixing is the main process responsible for the observed surface N enhancements (see Sect. 2). The predictions\nwe present for close binaries can be used to test the validity of\nthis assumption.\nIn Sect. 4 we conclude that eclipsing binaries in the\nMagellanic Clouds are the most promising test cases for rotational mixing. In these systems we expect the biggest enhancements of N at the surface. Also, the uncertainty in the massloss rates plays a less important role, as radiatively driven winds\nare reduced at low metallicity. A disadvantage of Magellanic\nCloud binaries with respect to Galactic systems is the greater\ndistance. Long integration times may be needed to obtain spectra with high enough quality to determine the stellar parameters and abundances. The advantage of using eclipsing binaries\nis that we can compare directly to evolution models with corresponding masses and orbital periods. Therefore, just a few wellstudied systems may be enough to put constraints on the efficiency of rotational mixing. However, ideally one would prefer\na large sample to enable a statistical comparison.\nThe main parameter in our code that affects the efficiency\nof mixing due to rotational instabilities is fc (see Sect 2) which\nhas been calibrated directly against the surface N abundances\nin the VLT-FLAMES survey. However, the calibration involves\nmultiple parameters, such as f\u03bc which is a measure of how effectively a gradient in mean molecular weight can inhibit rotational mixing. We expect that uncertainties in this parameter\nare not important for our predictions for nitrogen, as this element is mainly produced and transported to the envelope early\nin the evolution, before a strong mean molecular-weight gradient has been established at the interface between the core and\nthe envelope. However, a lower value of f\u03bc may lead to higher\nhelium surface abundances, which may facilitate the possibility\nof chemically homogeneous evolution in close binaries, but this\nremains to be investigated.\nWe use a large amount of overshooting in our models (0.355\ntimes the pressure scale height H p ), to reproduce the extension of the main sequence observed in the VLT-FLAMES data.\nHowever, the amount of overshooting is an uncertain parameter and some authors quote lower values for the amount of\novershooting, for example Schroder et al. (1997) who find 0.240.32H p based on eclipsing binaries with stellar masses between\n2.5 and 6.5 M\u2299 , (see also Stothers & Chin 1992; Alongi et al.\n1993). We recomputed one of our models (20+15 M\u2299 , 3 days)\nwithout overshooting we find that, although the stars are less\nluminous as expected, the surface nitrogen abundance and the\nradius at a given time are very similar (deviations of less 0.01\ndex in the N abundance at a given age, and less than 4% in the\nradius for a given nitrogen surface abundance). For tighter binaries we expect an even smaller effect on the radius. We conclude\nthat our predictions are not very sensitive to the uncertainties in\nthe overshooting parameter.\nIn our models we assume that mixing processes in binaries\noperate in the same way as in single stars. For both single stars\nand binary members we find that the stellar interior rotates nearly\nrigidly (at least during the early phase of evolution of interest\nhere) as a result of efficient internal angular momentum transport\nby magnetic torques. Having very similar internal rotational profiles, the only difference in our models arises from the evolution\nof the rotation rate, which in single stars is governed by angular\nmomentum loss and evolutionary expansion, while in binaries\nthe tides play a major role. However, in the binary models we\nconsider the stars are close to filling their Roche lobe. They are\nslightly deformed in a lob-sided way, no longer being symmetric around the rotation axis. In addition, one side of the star is\n\n\f10\n\nS. E. de Mink, M. Cantiello, N. Langer, et al.: Rotational mixing in massive binaries:\n\nirradiated by the companion and may be heated. Although the\nsystem is synchronized, the tides continue to extract or deposit\nangular momentum from or onto the stars. How such effects, induced by the presence of the companion star, interact with the\ndifferent rotational instabilities is not well understood and poses\nan additional uncertainty on our predictions. If such effects are\nimportant and lead to additional mixing, our predictions for the\nN surface abundance can still be used as a test for rotational\nmixing if they are considered as lower limits to the expected N\nabundance.\nAvoiding mass transfer in short-period binaries\n\nWe have shown that rotational mixing, if it is as efficient as assumed in our models, can lead to chemically homogeneous evolution for tight binaries with a 50 M\u2299 primary. In these models\nthe primary star stays so compact that the secondary star is the\nfirst to fill its Roche lobe.\nThis peculiar behavior of the radius of stars, which are efficiently mixed, has been noted in models of rapidly rotating\nmassive single stars (Maeder 1987) and has been suggested as\nan evolutionary channel for the progenitors of long gamma-ray\nbursts (Yoon et al. 2006; Woosley & Heger 2006) in the collapsar scenario Woosley (1993). In single stars this type of evolution only occurs at low metallicity, because at solar metallicity mass and angular momentum loss in the form of a stellar\nwind spins down the stars and prevents initially rapidly rotating stars from evolving chemically homogeneously (Yoon et al.\n2006; Brott et al. 2009). In a close binary tides can replenish the\nangular momentum, opening the possibility for chemically homogeneous evolution in the solar neighborhood.\nThe binary models presented here all evolve into contact, but\n(as we discussed briefly in Sect 5.2) Roche-lobe overflow may be\navoided altogether in systems in which the secondary stays compact, either because it also evolves chemically homogeneously,\nwhich may occur if M1 \u2248 M2 , or because it evolves on a much\nlonger timescale than the primary, when M2 \u226a M1 . Whereas\nstandard binary evolution theory predicts that the shorter the orbital period, the earlier mass transfer sets in, we find that binaries with the lowest orbital periods may avoid the onset of mass\ntransfer altogether. This evolution scenario does not fit in the\ntraditional classification of interacting binaries into Case A, B\nand C, based on the evolutionary stage of the primary component at the onset of mass transfer (Kippenhahn & Weigert 1967;\nLauterborn 1970). In the remainder of this paper we will refer to\nthis new case of binary evolution, in which mass transfer is delayed or avoided altogether as a result of very efficient internal\nmixing, as Case M.\nThe massive and tight systems in which Case M can occur\nare rare. Additional mixing processes induced by the presence\nof the companion star, which may be important in such systems,\nwill widen the parameter space in which Case M can occur: it\nwould lower the minimum mass for the primary star and increase the orbital period below which this type of evolution occurs. The massive LMC binary [L72] LH 54-425, with an orbital\nperiod of 2.25 d (Williams et al. 2008, see also Sec. 5.2) may be\na candidate for this type of evolution. Another interesting case\nis the galactic binary WR20a, which consists of two core hydrogen burning stars of 82.7 \u00b1 5.5 and 81.9 \u00b1 5.5 M\u2299 in an orbit of\n3.69 d. Both stars are so compact that they are detached. The surface abundance show evidence of rotational mixing: a nitrogen\nabundance of six times solar is observed and carbon is depleted\n(Bonanos et al. 2004; Rauw et al. 2005).\n\nShort-period Wolf-Rayet and black-hole binaries\n\nIf Roche-lobe overflow is avoided throughout the core hydrogenburning phase of the primary star, both stars will stay compact while the primary gradually becomes a helium star and\ncan be observed as a Wolf-Rayet star. Initially the Wolf-Rayet\nstar will be more massive than its main sequence companion,\nbut mass loss due to the strong stellar wind may reverse the\nmass ratio, especially in systems which started with nearly equal\nmasses. Examples of observed short-period Wolf-Rayet binaries with a main-sequence companion are CQ Cep8 , CX Cep9 ,\nHD 19357610 and the very massive system HD 31188411\n(van der Hucht 2001). Such systems are thought to be the result\nof very non-conservative mass transfer or a common envelope\nphase (e.g. Petrovic et al. 2005a). Case M constitutes an alternative formation scenario which does not involve mass transfer.\nCase M is also interesting in the light of massive black-hole\nbinaries. Orosz et al. (2007) recently published the stellar parameters of M33 X-7, located in the nearby galaxy Messier 33\nwhich harbors one of the most massive stellar black holes known\nto date, Mbh = 15.7 \u00b1 1.5 M\u2299 , orbiting a massive O star, MO =\n70 \u00b1 7 M\u2299 , which resides inside its Roche lobe in spite of the\nfact that the orbit is very tight, Porb = 3.45 d. The explanation\nfor the formation of this system with standard binary evolutionary models involves a common-envelope phase that sets in after\nthe end of core helium burning (Case C), as the progenitor of\nthe black hole must have had a radius much greater than the\ncurrent orbital separation. This scenario is problematic as it requires that the black-hole progenitor lost roughly ten times less\nmass before the onset of Roche-lobe overflow than what is currently predicted by stellar evolution models (Orosz et al. 2007).\nAn additional problem is that the most likely outcome of the\ncommon envelope phase would be a merger, as the envelopes\nof massive stars are tightly bound (Podsiadlowski et al. 2003).\nIn the Case M scenario the black-hole progenitor can stay compact and avoid Roche-lobe overflow at least until the end of core\nhelium burning, such that it retains its envelope.\nThere are examples of stellar mass black-hole binaries with\nshort periods and a massive main-sequence companion, in which\nnearly chemically homogeneous evolution may be important.\nIC 10 X-1 is a system harboring the most massive stellar mass\nblack hole known to date with a mass of at least 21 M\u2299 , orbiting\na Wolf-Rayet star of approximately 25 M\u2299 in an orbit of 1.45\ndays (Silverman & Filippenko 2008). Homogeneous evolution\nhelps to explain the high mass of the black hole, but the short\norbital period poses a difficulty, also for Case M: strong mass\nloss during the Wolf-Rayet life time will widen the orbit. Other\nexamples of high mass black hole binaries with short orbital periods are the famous systems Cyg X-112 (Herrero et al. 1995),\nLMC X-113 (Orosz et al. 2008) and LMC X-314 (Yao et al. 2005,\nand references therein).\nThe subsequent evolution of tight rapidly rotating WolfRayet binaries remains to be investigated. If one or both members of the system can retain enough angular momentum to fulfill the collapsar scenario (Woosley 1993), which may be hard\nas the tides can slow down the stars (e.g. Detmers et al. 2008), it\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\nCQ Cep: MWR = 24 M\u2299 , MO = 30 M\u2299 , Porb = 1.6 d\nCX Cep: MWR = 20 M\u2299 , MO = 28 M\u2299 , Porb = 2.1 d\nHD 193576: MWR = 9 M\u2299 , MO = 29 M\u2299 , Porb = 4.2 d\nHD 311884: MWR = 51 M\u2299 , MO = 60 M\u2299 , Porb = 6.2 d\nCyg X-1: Mbh \u2248 10 M\u2299 , MO \u2248 18 M\u2299 , Porb = 5.6 d\nLMC X-1: Mbh \u2248 10 M\u2299 , MO \u2248 30 M\u2299 , Porb = 3.9 d\nLMC X-3: Mbh \u2248 4\u201310 M\u2299 , MO \u2248 40 M\u2299 , Porb = 4.2 d\n\n\fS. E. de Mink, M. Cantiello, N. Langer, et al.: Rotational mixing in massive binaries:\n\nmay lead to the production of one or even two long gamma-ray\nbursts.\nAlthough promising, the importance of this channel may be\nsmall due to the limited binary parameter space in which Case M\ncan occur. To make any strong statements about this new evolutionary scenario, further modeling is needed, which we will\nundertake in the near future.\n\n7. Conclusion\nWe investigated the effect of rotational mixing on the evolution\nof detached short-period massive binaries using a state of the\nart stellar evolution code. The efficiency of rotational mixing\nwas calibrated under the assumption that rotational mixing is\nthe main process responsible for the observed N enhancements\nin rotating stars.\nWe find nitrogen surface enhancements of up to 0.6 dex for\nmassive binaries in the SMC. The largest enhancements can be\nreached in systems with orbital periods less than about 2 days, in\nwhich the primary is massive (about 20 M\u2299 or more) and evolved\n(filling its Roche lobe by about 80% or more) and the secondary\nis significantly less massive, which leads to a more spacious\nRoche lobe for the primary (preferably M2 /M1 . 0.75).\nWe propose to use such systems as test cases for rotational\nmixing. These systems often show eclipses and big radial velocity variations, such that their stellar parameters, the rotation rate\nand possibly their surface abundances can be determined with\nhigh accuracy. This enables a direct comparison between an observed system and models computed with the appropriate stellar\nand binary parameters. An additional major advantage of using\ndetached main-sequence binaries is the constraint on the evolutionary history. For a fast spinning apparently single star we do\nnot know whether it was born as a fast rotator or whether its rotation rate is the result of mass transfer or merger event. In a detached main-sequence binary we can exclude the occurrence of\nany mass transfer phase since the onset of core-hydrogen burning (see Sect 1).\nIn the most massive binaries we find that rotational instabilities can efficiently mix centrally produced helium throughout\nthe stellar envelope of the primary. They follow the evolution\nfor chemically homogeneous stars: they stay within their Roche\nlobe, being over-luminous and blue compared to normal stars.\nDue to large amount of nitrogen and helium at the surface these\nstars can be observed as Wolf-Rayet stars with hydrogen in their\nspectra. In contrast to standard binary evolution, we find that it\nis the less massive star in these systems that fills its Roche lobe\nfirst.\nThere may be regions in the binary parameter space in which\nRoche-lobe overflow can be avoided completely during the core\nhydrogen-burning phase of the primary. The parameter space for\nthis new evolutionary scheme, which we denote Case M to emphasize the important role of mixing, increases if additional mixing processes play a role in such massive systems. It may provide\nan alternative channel for the formation or tight Wolf-Rayet binaries with a main-sequence companion, without the need for\na mass transfer and common envelope phase to bring the stars\nclose together. This scenario is also potentially interesting for\ntight massive black hole binaries, such as M33 X-7 (Orosz et al.\n2007), for which no satisfactory evolutionary scenario exists to\ndate.\nAcknowledgements.
