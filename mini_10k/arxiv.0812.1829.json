We study Whitehead products in the rational homotopy groups\nof a general component of a function space. For the component of any based\nmap f : X \u2192 Y , in either the based or free function space, our main results\nexpress the Whitehead product directly in terms of the Quillen minimal model\nof f . These results follow from a purely algebraic development in the setting of\nchain complexes of derivations of differential graded Lie algebras, which is of\ninterest in its own right. We apply the results to study the Whitehead length\nof function space components.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet f : X \u2192 Y be a based map of based, simply connected CW complexes with\nX a finite complex. Let map(X, Y ; f ) denote the path component containing f in\nthe space of basepoint-free continuous functions from X to Y, and map\u2217 (X, Y ; f )\nthe component in the space of basepoint-preserving functions. In this paper, we\nstudy the structure of the Whitehead product on the rational homotopy groups of\nthese function spaces.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the Quillen model\nof the map\n\u03b7 \u00d7 1 : S p+q\u22121 \u00d7 X \u2192 (S p \u2228 S q ) \u00d7 X\nwhere \u03b7 is the Whitehead product. Our description is given in the framework of\nchain complexes of generalized derivations of Quillen models, which was introduced\nin [10] in order to identify the rational homotopy groups of function space components. Section 3 is a purely algebraic development in the setting of chain complexes\nthat arise in the category of differential graded (DG) Lie algebras. Using the form\nof the Quillen model of \u03b7 \u00d7 1 as a guide, we construct a \"Whitehead product\" on\nthe homology of the mapping cone of a map of DG Lie algebras. We extend our\nconstruction to the chain complexes of generalized derivations mentioned above. In\nSection 4, we record a detailed formula useful for applications, and mention briefly\nsome extensions, such as iterated products. In Section 5, we return to the topological setting and prove our main result: we identify Whitehead products in the\nrational homotopy groups of map(X, Y ; f ) and map\u2217 (X, Y ; f ) with the \"Whitehead\nproducts\" constructed algebraically from the Quillen model of the map.\nWe present various applications in Section 6, where we study the rational Whitehead length of function space components. Given a space Z, let WL(Z), the Whitehead length of Z, denote the length of longest, non-zero iterated Whitehead bracket\nDate: November 8, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 55P62, 55Q15.\nKey words and phrases. Whitehead product, Function Space, Quillen minimal model, derivation, coformal space, Whitehead length.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGREGORY LUPTON AND SAMUEL BRUCE SMITH\n\nin \u03c0\u22652 (Z). (We avoid considerations of the fundamental group throughout this paper.) Thus WL(Z) = 1 means all Whitehead products vanish and WL(Z) \u2265 2\nmeans that there exists a non-trivial Whitehead product. Let WLQ (Z), the rational\nWhitehead length of Z, denote the length of longest, non-zero iterated Whitehead\nbracket in \u03c0\u22652 (Z) \u2297 Q. We first observe that, for the null component of a function\nspace, we have WLQ (map(X, Y ; 0)) = WLQ (Y ) as a consequence of classical ideas\n(Theorem 6.1). Using our formula, we then prove that, for any map f : X \u2192 Y,\nthat is, for a general component, we have\nmax{WLQ (map\u2217 (X, Y ; f )), WLQ (map(X, Y ; f ))} \u2264 WLQ (Y )\nprovided Y is a coformal space (Theorem 6.2). Focusing on the based function\nspace, we also prove that\nWLQ (map\u2217 (X, Y ; f )) \u2264 cl0 (X),\nwhere cl0 (X) denotes the rational cone-length of X (Theorem 6.4) complementing\nthe corresponding (integral) result at the null component due to Ganea [6]. In\nTheorem 6.5, we apply our formulae to give a complete calculation of the rational\nWhitehead length of all components of map(X, S n ) and of map\u2217 (X, S n ) for X a\nfinite, simply connected CW complex. Finally, we show that the inequality\nWLQ (map(X, Y ; f )) > WLQ (map(X, Y ; 0)) = WLQ (Y )\nmay hold. Precisely, in Example 6.6, we give a space Y with vanishing rational\nWhitehead products and a map f : S 3 \u2192 Y such that WLQ (map(S 3 , Y ; f )) \u2265 2.\nWe assume familiarity with rational homotopy theory from Quillen's point of\nview. Our main reference for this material is [5] (see also [13, 15]). We introduce notation as we go but recall here that a map f : X \u2192 Y of simply connected CW complexes of finite type has a Quillen minimal model which is a map\nLf : (LX , dX ) \u2192 (LY , dY ) of connected DG Lie algebras over Q. The Quillen minimal model of f is a complete invariant of the rationalization of f . In particular,\nthere is a natural isomorphism H\u2217 (LX , dX ) \u223c\n= \u03c0\u2217 (\u03a9X) \u2297 Q of graded Lie algebras.\nThe map induced by f on rational homotopy Lie algebras corresponds, with these\nidentifications for X and Y, to the map induced by Lf on homology. Our main\nresults explain how the Whitehead product in the rational homotopy groups of\nmap(X, Y ; f ) and map\u2217 (X, Y ; f ) depends on Lf .\nRemark 1.1. Rational Whitehead products for function spaces have been studied\nby several authors. In [16], Vigu\u00e9-Poirrier gave an elegant formula for Whitehead\nproducts in the null-components map\u2217 (X, Y ; 0) and map(X, Y ; 0) (including degree\n1) directly in terms of products in the rational homotopy of Y and the cup product\nin H \u2217 (X, Q) under certain restrictions on X and Y . This result was recently extended to full generality by Buijs and Murillo as a special case of their description\nof the rational homotopy Lie algebra of any component of a function space [4].\nAlso, we mention the recent work of Buijs, F\u00e9lix and Murillo [3] which identifies\na Lie model for spaces of sections and, in particular, for components of a function\nspace.\nOur work differs from these other results in at least two respects. First, we\ndescribe rational Whitehead products for general function space components by\nmeans of a construction that proceeds directly from the Quillen model of a map.\nBecause we focus on a description specifically at the level of rational homotopy\ngroups, rather than a more comprehensive description of the rational homotopy\n\n\fWHITEHEAD PRODUCTS IN FUNCTION SPACES\n\n3\n\ntype, we are able to give a fairly direct construction: our description lends itself\nwell to the study of specific examples. Second, our construction of topological\n(rational) Whitehead products is developed from a purely algebraic one on the\nmapping cone of certain maps of chain complexes (see Section 3). This provides\nthe basis for new developments either in the algebraic settings, or in topological\nsituations other than function spaces that correspond to mapping cones.\nAcknowledgement.

We thank the referee for a very careful reading of the paper.\n2. The Quillen Model of a certain map\nWe review the development of ideas in [10]. An element \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0p (map(X, Y ; f )) is\nrepresented by a map a : S p \u2192 map(X, Y ; f ) whose adjoint is a map A : S p \u00d7X \u2192 Y\nthat restricts to f : X \u2192 Y on X. By considering the Quillen minimal model of\nthe adjoint A we are led to consider a certain complex of (generalized) derivations\nof Quillen models, which we denoted by Der(LX , LY ; Lf ) in [10]. The homology\ngroups of this complex may be identified with the homotopy groups of the based\nmapping space map\u2217 (X, Y ; f ), and the homology groups of the mapping cone of\nthe (generalized) adjoint map\nadLf : LY \u2192 Der(LX , LY ; Lf )\nmay be identified with the homotopy groups of map(X, Y ; f ) (see [10, Th.3.1]). It\nis in this context that we wish to describe the Whitehead product.\nTopologically, a Whitehead product \u03b3 = [\u03b1, \u03b2]w \u2208 \u03c0p+q\u22121 (map(X, Y ; f )), for\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0p (map(X, Y ; f )) and \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c0q (map(X, Y ; f )), is represented by the composition\nS p+q\u22121\n\n\u03b7\n\n/ Sp \u2228 Sq\n\n(a|b)\n\n/ map(X, Y ; f ) ,\n8\n\n\u03b3\n\nwhere \u03b7 = [\u03b91 , \u03b92 ]w is the \"universal example\" of a Whitehead product. The adjoint\nC of \u03b3 is the composition\nS p+q\u22121 \u00d7 X\n\n\u03b7\u00d71\n\n/ (S p \u2228 S q ) \u00d7 X\n\n(A|B)f\n\n/8 Y .\n\nC\n\nAs in the previous paragraph, we will translate this adjoint into the setting of\ncomplexes of (generalized) derivations of Quillen models. In order to do so, a\ndescription of the Quillen model of \u03b7 \u00d7 1 is germane.\nWe say a graded rational vector space (V, d) with a differential d of degree \u22121\nis a DG space or, alternately, a chain complex. By a DG Lie algebra (L, d) we will\nmean a connected, graded Lie algebra L with bilinear product [ , ] satisfying\n(a) |[x, y]| = |x| + |y|\n(b) [x, y] = (\u22121)|x||y|+1[y, x] and\n(c) [x, [y, z]] = [[x, y], z] + (\u22121)|x||y|[y, [x, z]]\nand differential satisfying\nd([x, y]) = [d(x), y] + (\u22121)|x|[x, d(y)].\n\n\f4\n\nGREGORY LUPTON AND SAMUEL BRUCE SMITH\n\nWe write L(V ) for the free graded Lie algebra generated by the graded space V and\nextend this notation, writing L(V, W ) for the free Lie algebra generated by V and\nW and L(V, a) for the free Lie algebra generated by a and V where a is an element\nof homogeneous degree. We write L(V ; d) for the DG Lie algebra (L(V ), d).\nWe recall that a DG Lie algebra (L, d) has an associated DG Lie algebra of\nderivations (Der(L), D). Here Der(L) denotes the graded space of positive-degree\nderivations of L with the usual graded commutator product of derivations, that is,\n[\u03b8, \u03c6] = \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c6 \u2212 (\u22121)|\u03b8||\u03c6|\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b8\nfor \u03b8, \u03c6 \u2208 Der(L), and differential D(\u03b8) = [d, \u03b8] = d\u03b8 \u2212 (\u22121)|\u03b8| \u03b8d. Then the adjoint\nad: (L, d) \u2192 (Der(L), D), defined by ad(l)(l\u2032 ) = [l, l\u2032 ], is a map of DG Lie algebras.\nWe are interested in a natural generalization of this set-up. Let \u03c8 : (L, dL ) \u2192\n(K, dK ) be a given DG Lie algebra map. Define a \u03c8-derivation of degree n to be a\nlinear map \u03b8 : L\u2217 \u2192 K\u2217+n satisfying\n\u03b8([x, y]) = [\u03b8(x), \u03c8(y)] + (\u22121)n|x| [\u03c8(x), \u03b8(y)].\nWe write Dern (L, K; \u03c8) for the space of degree-n \u03c8-derivations. The differential\nD\u03c8 defined by\nD\u03c8 (\u03b8) = dK \u25e6 \u03b8 \u2212 (\u22121)|\u03b8|\u03b8 \u25e6 dL\nmakes the pair (Der(L, K; \u03c8), D\u03c8 ) a DG space. The \u03c8-adjoint (or \"generalized\nadjoint\") map\nad\u03c8 : (K, dK ) \u2192 (Der(L, K; \u03c8), D\u03c8 ),\ngiven by ad\u03c8 (\u03b1)(x) = [\u03b1, \u03c8(x)] for x \u2208 L, \u03b1 \u2208 K, is a map of DG spaces.\nOur description of the Quillen model of \u03b7 \u00d7 1 requires a construction featuring\nthese generalized derivations. Let L = L(V ; d) be a free DG Lie algebra. Let\np1 , . . . , pn be given integers > 1 and a1 , . . . , an elements of degree p1 \u2212 1, . . . , pn \u2212 1.\nWrite V ai = spi (V ) for the pi th suspension of V and let Sai : V \u2192 V ai denote the corresponding degree pi linear map. We define a new DG Lie algebra\n(L(a1 , . . . , an ), \u2202) by setting\n(1)\n\nL(a1 , . . . , an ) = L(V, a1 , . . . , an , V a1 , . . . , V an ).\n\nObserve that the suspension Sai : V \u2192 V ai extends as a derivation to an element\nSai \u2208 Derpi (L, L(a1 , . . . , an ); \u03bb) where \u03bb : L \u2192 L(a1 , . . . , an ) is the inclusion. Using\nthis, we define the differential as follows:\n\u2202(v) = d(v), \u2202(ai ) = 0 and \u2202 (Sai (v)) = (\u22121)pi \u22121 [ai , v] + (\u22121)pi Sai (dv)\nfor v \u2208 V. The definition of \u2202 gives the boundary relation\n(2)\n\nD\u03bb (Sai ) = (\u22121)pi \u22121 ad\u03bb (ai ) \u2208 Der(L, L(a1 , . . . , an ); \u03bb).\n\nRecall that a simply connected CW complex X of finite type admits a Quillen\nminimal model LX = L(V ; dX ) which is a free minimal DG Lie algebra with V \u223c\n=\ne \u2217 (X; Q) and H\u2217 (LX ) \u223c\ns\u22121 H\n= \u03c0\u2217 (\u03a9X) \u2297 Q. A map f : X \u2192 Y between such spaces\ninduces a DG Lie algebra map\nLf : (LX , dX ) \u2192 (LY , dY ).\nThe connection to the map \u03b7 \u00d7 1 : S p+q\u22121 \u00d7 X \u2192 (S p \u2228 S q ) \u00d7 X is provided by the\nfollowing result.\n\n\fWHITEHEAD PRODUCTS IN FUNCTION SPACES\n\n5\n\nTheorem 2.1.

It is easy to check that \u0393(\u03c7) = \u03c7 for\n\u03c7 \u2208 LX while \u0393(c) = (\u22121)p\u22121 [a, b]. (This sign is appropriate per the identifications\nof [17, Ch.X.7.10].) Let us write S[a,b] for the degree p + q \u2212 1 linear map induced\nby \u0393 via the rule\nS[a,b] (v) =def \u0393(Sc (v))\nfor v \u2208 V. Then S[a,b] extends to a \u03bb-derivation S[a,b] \u2208 Derp+q\u22121 (LX , LX (a, b); \u03bb)\nsatisfying the boundary relation\n\u0001\n(3)\nD\u03bb S[a,b] = (\u22121)q\u22121 ad\u03bb ([a, b]) \u2208 Derp+q\u22122 (LX , LX (a, b); \u03bb).\nWorking backward, we see the identification of the derivation S[a,b] satisfying (3)\ncompletely determines the Quillen minimal model of \u0393.\nIn the next section, we find a formula for S[a,b] . In fact, we identify this derivation\nas the \"universal example\" for Whitehead products constructed in the category of\nDG Lie algebras. (See Remark 3.3, below.) To explain this further, we introduce the\nmapping cone of a DG vector space map \u03c8 : (V, dV ) \u2192 (W, dW ), which we denote\nby (Rel(\u03c8), \u03b4\u03c8 ). This is the DG space with Reln (\u03c8) = Vn\u22121 \u2295 Wn and differential\n\u03b4\u03c8 defined as \u03b4\u03c8 (v, w) = (\u2212dV (v), \u03c8(v) + dW (w)). The construction yields a short\nexact sequence of DG spaces (W, dW ) \u2192 (Rel(\u03c8), \u03b4\u03c8 ) \u2192 (V, dV ) giving rise to a\nlong exact homology sequence whose connecting homomorphism is H(\u03c8). Applying\nthis to the adjoint ad\u03bb : (L(a, b), d) \u2192 (Der(L, L(a, b); \u03bb), D\u03bb ) we see the boundary\nconditions (2) and (3) are equivalent to the elements\n\u0001\n\u03b6a = ((\u22121)p a, Sa ) , \u03b6b = ((\u22121)q b, Sb ) and \u03b6[a,b] = (\u22121)q [a, b], S[a,b]\nbeing three D\u03bb -cycles in Rel(ad\u03bb ) of degree p, q and p + q \u2212 1, respectively. In the\nnext section, we construct a Whitehead product [ , ]w on H\u2217 (Rel(ad\u03bb )) satisfying\n[h\u03b6a i, h\u03b6b i]w = h\u03b6[a,b] i\nthereby completing the description of \u0393, the Quillen model of \u03b7 \u00d7 1, above.\n3. Whitehead products in the category of DG Lie Algebras\nIn this section, we describe the construction of Whitehead products on the homology of chain complexes of derivations arising from a given DG Lie algebra map\n\u03c8 : (L, dL ) \u2192 (K, dK ). We will approach our final construction in several steps.\nFirst we give the definition of a Whitehead product, referring to the classical correspondence between Whitehead products and Samelson products. Let sL denote\nthe suspension of L. Given x, y \u2208 L define a bilinear pairing on sL by the rule\n[sx, sy]w =def (\u22121)|x| s[x, y].\nThe pairing [ , ]w then satisfies the identities\n(i) |[\u03b1, \u03b2]w | = |\u03b1| + |\u03b2| \u2212 1\n(ii) [\u03b1, \u03b2]w = (\u22121)|\u03b1||\u03b2|[\u03b2, \u03b1]w and\n(iii) [\u03b1, [\u03b2, \u03b3]w ]w = (\u22121)|\u03b1|+1 [[\u03b1, \u03b2]w , \u03b3]w + (\u22121)(|\u03b1|+1)(|\u03b2|+1)[\u03b2, [\u03b1, \u03b3]w ]w\n\n\f6\n\nGREGORY LUPTON AND SAMUEL BRUCE SMITH\n\nfor \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 sL. These identities correspond, of course, to those satisfied by the\nhigher homotopy groups of a space with the Whitehead product [17, Chapter X.7].\nWe denote a bilinear pairing satisfying (i)-(iii) by [ , ]w and call it a Whitehead\nproduct.\nAs a preliminary, we next observe that a kind of \"pre-Whitehead product\" may\nbe defined on any DG Lie algebra (L, dL ). Specifically, define a bilinear pairing on\nL by setting\n{x, y} =def (\u22121)|x|+1 [x, dL (y)].\n\n(4)\n\nThe pairing { , } clearly satisfies (i). Further, we have the following:\nProposition 3.1. The bilinear pairing { , } defined on L by (4) satisfies the identities (ii) and (iii) up to boundaries in (L, dL ).\nProof. Write \u223c for the homologous relation in (L, dL ) and let d = dL . Let p =\n|x|, q = |y| and r = |z|. Use the boundary\nd ([x, y]) = [d(x), y] + (\u22121)p [x, d(y)]\nto obtain\n{x, y} = (\u22121)p+1 [x, d(y)]\n\n\u223c [d(x), y] = (\u22121)(p\u22121)q+1 [y, d(x)]\n\n= (\u22121)pq {y, x}\n\nFor (iii), observe\n{x, {y, z}} = (\u22121)p+q [x, d ([y, d(z)])]\n= (\u22121)p+q [x, [d(y), d(z)]]\n= (\u22121)p+q [[x, d(y)], d(z)] + (\u22121)q(p+1) [d(y), [x, d(z)]]\nThen note that\n(\u22121)p+q [[x, d(y)], d(z)] = (\u22121)q+1 [{x, y}, d(z)] = (\u22121)p+1 {{x, y}, z} .\nFinally, the boundary\nd ([y, [x, d(z)]]) = [d(y), [x, d(z)]] + (\u22121)q [y, d ([x, d(z)])]\nimplies\n(\u22121)q(p+1) [d(y), [x, d(z)]]\n\n\u223c (\u22121)pq+1 [y, d ([x, d(z)])]\n= (\u22121)(p+1)(q+1) {y, {x, z}} . \u0003\n\nNext we consider the case of a DG Lie algebra map \u03c8 : (L, dL ) \u2192 (K, dK ) and its\nmapping cone (Rel(\u03c8), \u03b4\u03c8 ). We will construct a Whitehead product on the homology\nof (Rel(\u03c8), \u03b4\u03c8 ). Notice that this is a chain complex, not a DG Lie algebra; it is not\nimmediately evident that such a product may be defined. Our construction here\nrefers to the two previous steps.\nLet (a, \u03b1) \u2208 Relp (\u03c8) and (b, \u03b2) \u2208 Relq (\u03c8) be given. Recall that\n\u0002 \u0003this means\na \u2208 Lp\u22121 , b \u2208 Lq\u22121 while \u03b1 \u2208 Kp , \u03b2 \u2208 Kq . Define a bilinear pairing [ , ] , using the\nordinary bracket in L but the pairing defined by (4) in K, by setting\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0001\n(5) [(a, \u03b1), (b, \u03b2)] =def ((\u22121)p [a, b], {\u03b1, \u03b2}) = (\u22121)p [a, b], (\u22121)p+1 [\u03b1, dK (\u03b2)] .\nWe then have the following:\n\nProposition 3.2. Let \u03c8 : (L, dL ) \u2192 (K, d\u0002K )\u0003be a DG Lie algebra map with mapping\ncone (Rel(\u03c8), \u03b4\u03c8 ). The bilinear pairing [ , ] on Rel(\u03c8) defined by (5) induces a\nWhitehead product [ , ]w on H\u2217 (Rel(\u03c8)).\n\n\fWHITEHEAD PRODUCTS IN FUNCTION SPACES\n\n7\n\nProof. For suppose that (a, \u03b1) and (b, \u03b2) are \u03b4\u03c8 -cycles. Then dL (a) = dL (b) = 0\nwhile dK (\u03b1) = \u2212\u03c8(a) and dK (\u03b2) = \u2212\u03c8(b). Observe that\ndK ({\u03b1, \u03b2}) = (\u22121)p+1 dK ([\u03b1, dK (\u03b2)]) = (\u22121)p+1 [dK (\u03b1), dK (\u03b2)] = \u2212\u03c8 ((\u22121)p [a, b]) .\n\u0002\n\u0003\nThus the product [(a, \u03b1), (b, \u03b2)] is a \u03b4\u03c8 -cycle, as well.\nNext suppose (a, \u03b1) = \u03b4\u03c8 (c, \u03b3) is a \u03b4\u03c8 -boundary and (b, \u03b2) is again a \u03b4\u03c8 -cycle.\nThen\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[(a, \u03b1), (b, \u03b2)] = \u03b4\u03c8 ((\u22121)p [c, b], \u2212{\u03b3, \u03b2})\nis a \u03b4\u03c8 -boundary, as well. To verify this in the second variable observe that\n\ndK (\u2212{\u03b3, \u03b2}) + (\u22121)p \u03c8([c, b]) = (\u22121)p+1 [dK (\u03b3), dK (\u03b2)] + (\u22121)p \u03c8([c, b])\n= (\u22121)p+1 [\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c8(c), dK (\u03b2)] + (\u22121)p \u03c8([c, b])\n= {\u03b1, \u03b2},\nsince dK (\u03b2) = \u2212\u03c8(b).\n\u0002 \u0003\nThe pairing [ , ] thus induces a bilinear pairing [ , ]w on H\u2217 (Rel(\u03c8)) satisfying\nthe degree condition (i) by construction. The induced product satisfies (ii) and (iii)\nin the second variable by Proposition 3.1. In the first variable, [ , ]w corresponds\nto the classical Whitehead product (except with grading reduced one instead of\nincreased one).\n\u0003\nOur final step is to consider the (generalized) adjoint\nad\u03c8 : (K, dK ) \u2192 (Der(L, K; \u03c8), D\u03c8 )\n\u0001\nand its mapping cone Rel(ad\u03c8 ), \u03b4ad\u03c8 . We define Whitehead products on the homology of the latter two complexes. Notice that, once again, neither of these\ncomplexes is a DG Lie algebra.\nAs at the start of Section 2, the Whitehead product of two elements \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0p (X)\nand \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c0q (X) involves the \"universal example\" of such Whitehead products,\nnamely \u03b7 \u2208 \u03c0p+q\u22121 (S p \u2228 S q ). This is then mapped into \u03c0p+q\u22121 (X) by (\u03b1 | \u03b2), a\nmap induced by the given homotopy elements. Here, we take a similar approach.\nGiven two elements of H(Rel(ad\u03c8 )), of degree p and q we first describe a \"universal\nexample\" of the Whitehead product in Hp+q\u22121 (Rel(ad\u03bb )) (see (7) below). This\nis then mapped to Hp+q\u22121 (Rel(ad\u03c8 )) using the elements whose product we are\nforming (see (10) below).\nFor our universal example, we define a particular product in the mapping cone of\nthe generalized adjoint ad\u03bb : L(a, b) \u2192 Der(L, L(a, b); \u03bb) defined above (1). So assume now that (L, dL ) = L(V ; dL ) is a free DG Lie algebra. Let a and b be of degrees\np\u22121 and q\u22121, respectively. Then recall L(a, b) = L(V, a, b, V a , V b ; \u2202a,b ) and the suspensions Sa : V \u2192 V a and Sb : V \u2192 V b extend to elements of (Der(L, L(a, b); \u03bb), D\u03bb )\nof degree p and q, respectively, satisfying D\u03bb (Sa ) = (\u22121)p\u22121 ad\u03bb (a) and D\u03bb (Sb ) =\n(\u22121)q\u22121 ad\u03bb (b). So ((\u22121)p a, Sa ) and ((\u22121)q b, Sb ) are cycles in degrees p and q of\n(Rel(ad\u03bb ), \u03b4ad\n\u0001 \u03bb ). Define elements \u0398a , \u0398b of degrees p and q in the DG Lie algebra\n(Der L(a, b) , D) by setting\n(6)\n\n\u0398x (v) = Sx (v) and \u0398x (a) = \u0398x (b) = \u0398x (V a ) = \u0398x (V b ) = 0\n\nfor x = a, b and v \u2208 V. Note that \u0398x \u25e6 \u03bb = Sx \u2208 Der(L, L(a, b); \u03bb). From the\nprevious step, we set\n{\u0398a , \u0398b } = (\u22121)p+1 [\u0398a , D(\u0398b )] \u2208 Derp+q\u22121 (L(a, b))\n\n\f8\n\nGREGORY LUPTON AND SAMUEL BRUCE SMITH\n\nand observe that {\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb \u2208 Derp+q\u22121 (L, L(a, b); \u03bb). Now define\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(7)\n[ ((\u22121)p a, Sa ) , ((\u22121)q b, Sb ) ] =def ((\u22121)q [a, b], {\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb) .\n\nObserve that the right-hand side is a cycle of (Rel(ad\u03bb ), \u03b4ad\u03bb ) of degree p + q \u2212 1.\nThis is the universal example of a Whitehead product mentioned above.\n\nRemark 3.3. Taking (L, dL ) = (LX , dX ) to be the Quillen model of a simply connected complex X, we see that\n{\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb \u2208 Derp+q\u22121 (LX , LX (a, b); \u03bb)\nsatisfies the boundary condition (3). Setting S[a,b] = {\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb completes the\ndescription of the Quillen minimal model of \u03b7 \u00d7 1 : S p+q\u22121 \u00d7 X \u2192 (S p \u2228 S q ) \u00d7 X.\nFinally, we turn to the mapping cone (Rel(ad\u03c8 ), \u03b4ad\u03c8 ) of the generalized adjoint\ncorresponding to a DG Lie algebra map \u03c8 : (L, dL ) \u2192 (K, dK ) with L = L(V ) free.\nSuppose given two \u03b4ad\u03c8 -cycles,\n\u03b6a = (\u03c7a , \u03b8a ) \u2208 Relp (ad\u03c8 ) and \u03b6b = (\u03c7b , \u03b8b ) \u2208 Relq (ad\u03c8 ).\nThe pair \u03b6a , \u03b6b induce a DG Lie algebra map\n(8)\n\n(\u03b6a | \u03b6b )\u03c8 : (L(a, b), dL(a,b) ) \u2192 (K, dK )\n\ndefined, on the basis of L(a, b), as:\n(\u03b6a | \u03b6b )\u03c8 (x) = (\u22121)|x|+1 \u03c7x , (\u03b6a | \u03b6b )\u03c8 (v) = \u03c8(v) and (\u03b6a | \u03b6b )\u03c8 (Sx (v)) = \u03b8x (v)\nfor x = a, b and v \u2208 V. Note that this map commutes with differentials on generators\nof the form Sx (v) since (\u03b6a | \u03b6b )\u03c8 \u25e6 Sx and \u03b8x agree on L as \u03c8-derivations.

Let \u03b6a , \u03b6b , \u03b6c \u2208 Rel(ad\u03c8 ) be \u03b4ad\u03bb -cycles of degree p, q and r,\nrespectively.

Let \u03b6z = {\u03b6a , \u03b6b } \u2208 Relp+q\u22121 (L, K; \u03c8).

This is readily checked to define a DG map: use the\nfact that \u03b3z is a cycle to check on generators Sz (v).

Now observe that, in\n\u0001\nDer(L, L(a, b); \u03bb), D\u03bb , we have\n\u0001\n\u0001\nD [\u0398a , \u0398b ] \u25e6 \u03bb = D\u03bb [\u0398a , \u0398b ] \u25e6 \u03bb ,\nsince each expression agrees on every generator v of L. Consequently, in Rel(ad\u03bb ),\nwe have\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b4ad\u03bb 0, [\u0398a , \u0398b ] \u25e6 \u03bb = 0, (D [\u0398a , \u0398b ]) \u25e6 \u03bb .\nReturning to the above, we may write\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[ ((\u22121)p a, Sa ) , ((\u22121)q b, Sb ) ] = (\u22121)pq [ ((\u22121)q b, Sb ) , ((\u22121)p a, Sa ) ]\n\u0001\n\u2212 \u03b4ad\u03bb 0, [\u0398a , \u0398b ] \u25e6 \u03bb .\nFrom the observation of Remark 3.5, it now follows that the pairing of (10) of cycles\nof Rel(ad\u03c8 ) satisfies the Whitehead\nidentity (ii) up to boundaries, and in particular\n\u0001\ninduces a pairing H\u2217 Rel(ad\u03c8 ) that satisfies (ii).\n\n\f10\n\nGREGORY LUPTON AND SAMUEL BRUCE SMITH\n\nThe proof of (iii) follows the same line of argument making use of Proposition 3.4.\nIndeed, using it, we may amplify the diagram of Remark 3.5 into the following\ncommutative diagram of chain maps:\nL(z, c)\nGG\nGG(\u03b6z |\u03b6c )\u03c8\nGG\nGG\nG#\n\u03c6z\nK\nw;\nww\nw\nw\nww\n\u000f ww (\u03b6a |\u03b6b |\u03b6c )\u03c8\nL(a, b, c)\n\nad\u03bb\n\nad\u03c8\n\n/ Der(L, L(z, c); \u03bb)\nll\nlll\nl\nl\n\u0001\nlll\nulll (\u03b6z |\u03b6c )\u03c8 \u2217\n/ Der(L, K; \u03c8)\n(\u03c6z )\u2217\niRRR (\u03b6 |\u03b6 |\u03b6 ) \u0001\nRRRa b c \u03c8 \u2217\nRRR\nRRR\nR\n\u000f\n/ Der(L, L(a, b, c); \u03bb)\n\nad\u03bb\n\nwhich in turn induces chain maps of mapping cones of the horizontal maps. Each\nterm in (iii) may thus be identified as the image of its counterpart in the induced\nmap of mapping cones given by the lower trapezoid of this diagram. Again the\ncorresponding identity holds up to a boundary in this lower Rel(ad\u03bb ), in which\n\u03bb : L \u2192 L(a, b, c). As in the preceding case, this passes to the needed identity in\nRel(ad\u03c8 ) by the chain maps induced by the chain map (\u03b6a | \u03b6b | \u03b6c )\u03c8 : L(a,\n\u0002 b, c) \u0003\u2192 K.\nIt remains to show that, if either \u03b6a or \u03b6b is a boundary, then [\u03b6a , \u03b6b ] is a\nboundary also so that the pairing passes to homology. Suppose then that \u03b6a =\n\u03b4ad\u03c8 (\u03b6c ) is a boundary in Relp (ad\u03c8 ) so that \u03b6c = (\u03c7c , \u03b8c ) \u2208 Relp+1 (ad\u03c8 ) satisfies\ndK (\u03c7c ) = \u2212\u03c7a and D\u03c8 (\u03b8c ) = \u03b8a \u2212 ad\u03c8 (\u03c7c ).\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002We show\n\u0003 that [\u03b6a , \u03b6b ] bounds also. To do this, we would like to form the product\n[\u03b6c , \u03b6b ] \u2208 Relp+q (ad\u03c8 ) but our construction above requires \u03b6c to be a \u03b4ad\u03c8 -cycle.\nTo accomodate non-cycles, we modify the construction of L(a, b) as follows. Define\nb = L(V, a, b, c, V a , V b , V c ; d)\nb with |c| = p, and with\nb b, c), d)\na DG Lie algebra (L(a,\nb\nb\nb\nb\ndifferential given by d(v) = dL (v), d(a) = d(b) = 0, d(c) = \u2212a and\nb a (v)) = (\u22121)p\u22121 [a, v] + (\u22121)p Sa (dL (v))\nd(S\nb b (v)) = (\u22121)q\u22121 [b, v] + (\u22121)q Sb (dL (v))\nd(S\n\nb c (v)) = (\u22121)p\u22121 [c, v] + Sa (v) + (\u22121)p+1 Sc (dL (v))\nd(S\n\nfor v \u2208 V. The formula for the boundary of Sc gives the relation\n\nD\u03bb (Sc ) = (\u22121)p\u22121 ad\u03bb (c) + Sa \u2208 Der(L, L\u0302(a, b, c); \u03bb)\nwhere \u03bb : L \u2192 L\u0302(a, b, c) is the inclusion. Define \u0398b , \u0398c in Der(L\u0302(a, b, c)) as above:\n\u0398x (v) = Sx (v) and \u0398x (y) = \u0398x (V y ) = 0\nfor x = b, c, y = a, b, c and v \u2208 V. The classes \u03b6a , \u03b6b and \u03b6c induce, as above, a DG\nLie algebra map\nb b, c), d) \u2192 (K, dK ) with\n\u03c6 : (L(a,\n\n\u03c6(x) = (\u22121)|x|+1 \u03c7x , \u03c6(c) = (\u22121)p \u03c7c , \u03c6(v) = \u03c8(v) and \u03c6(Sy (v)) = \u03b8y (v)\nb\nb\nfor x = a, b, y = a, b, c and v \u2208 V. Writing\n\u0001 \u03bb : L \u2192 L(a, b, c) for the inclusion, a\nstraightforward computation in (Rel ad\u03bbb , \u03b4ad\u03bbb ) shows that\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\nb = (\u22121)q [a, b], {\u0398a, \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb\nb .\n\u03b4ad\u03bbb (\u22121)q [c, b], \u2212{\u0398c, \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb\n\n\fWHITEHEAD PRODUCTS IN FUNCTION SPACES\n\n11\n\nThat is, the universal\nexample of a Whitehead product, constructed now in the com\u0001\nplex (Rel ad\u03bbb , \u03b4ad\u03bbb ), is a boundary there. As in Remark 3.5, the map \u03c6 induces a\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\nb =\nchain map \u03c6 : (Rel ad\u03bbb , \u03b4ad\u03bbb ) \u2192 (Rel(ad\u03c8 ), \u03b4ad\u03c8 ). As \u03c6 (\u22121)q [a, b], {\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[\u03b6a , \u03b6b ] , it follows that the latter is a boundary.\n\u0003\nFinally, we obtain a Whitehead product on H\u2217 (Der(L, K; \u03c8)) when L is free\nas a direct consequence of the above. Suppose \u03b8a \u2208 Derp (L, K; \u03c8) and \u03b8b \u2208\nDerq (L, K; \u03c8) are D\u03c8 -cycles. Set \u03b6a\u2217 = (0, \u03b8a ) \u2208 Relp (ad\u03c8 ) and \u03b6b\u2217 = (0, \u03b8b ) \u2208\nRelq (ad\u03c8 ). Both are \u03b4ad\u03c8 -cycles. Thus we can write\n\u0002 \u2217 \u2217\u0003\n[\u03b6a , \u03b6b ] = (0, {\u03b6a\u2217 , \u03b6b\u2217 }) \u2208 Relp+q\u22121 (ad\u03c8 ).\nWe define\n(11)\nWe then obtain:\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[\u03b8a , \u03b8b ] =def {\u03b6a\u2217 , \u03b6b\u2217 } \u2208 Derp+q\u22121 (L, K; \u03c8).\n\nCorollary 3.7. Let \u0002\u03c8 : \u0003(L, dL ) \u2192 (K, dK ) be a DG Lie algebra map with L free.\nThe bilinear pairing [ , ] defined on cycles of (Der(L, K; \u03c8), \u03b4\u03c8 ) by (11) induces a\nWhitehead product [ , ]w on H\u2217 (Der(L, K; \u03c8)).\n\u0003\n4. Iterated Products of the Universal Example\nIn this section, we continue with our algebraic development and record some\nformulas and results that will be useful for our applications. Let (L, d) be a given\nfree DG Lie algebra and (L(a, b), \u2202a,b ) the associated DG Lie algebra for |a| =\np \u2212 1, |b| = q \u2212 1. We look in detail at the universal example of a Whitehead\nproduct\n{\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb \u2208 Derp+q\u22121 (L, L(a, b); \u03bb).\n\u0001 \u0001\nBegin in the DG Lie algebra Der L(a, b) , D . We are interested in the restriction\nof derivations \u0398 \u2208 Der(L(a, b)) to L \u2286 L(a, b), i.e., \u0398 \u25e6 \u03bb \u2208 Der(L, L(a, b); \u03bb) where\n\u03bb : L \u2192 L(a, b) is the inclusion.\n\u0001 \u0001\nRecall from (6) the definitions of \u0398a , \u0398b of degree p and q in Der L(a, b) , D .\nFrom the definitions, we have that\nD\u03bb (\u0398a \u25e6 \u03bb) = (\u22121)p\u22121 ad\u03bb (a)\n\nand\n\nD\u03bb (\u0398b \u25e6 \u03bb) = (\u22121)q\u22121 ad\u03bb (b).\n\nAmongst the terms that occur in {\u0398a , \u0398b }\u25e6\u03bb(v), we note that \u2202a,b \u25e6\u0398b \u25e6\u0398a \u25e6\u03bb(v) = 0,\nwhereas, e.g. \u0398b \u25e6 \u2202a,b \u25e6 \u0398a \u25e6 \u03bb(v) is generally non-zero. Using these facts, we obtain\nthat\n{\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb(v) = (\u22121)p+1 [\u0398a , D(\u0398b )] \u25e6 \u03bb(v)\n= (\u22121)p+q \u0398a \u25e6 ad\u03bb (b)(v) + (\u22121)pq D(\u0398b ) \u25e6 \u0398a \u25e6 \u03bb(v)\n= (\u22121)p+q \u0398a \u25e6 ad\u03bb (b)(v) + (\u22121)pq+q+1 \u0398b \u25e6 \u2202a,b \u25e6 \u0398a \u25e6 \u03bb(v)\n= (\u22121)p+q \u0398a \u25e6 ad\u03bb (b)(v) + (\u22121)pq+p+q \u0398b \u25e6 ad\u03bb (a)(v)\n+ (\u22121)(p+1)(q+1) \u0398b \u25e6 \u0398a \u25e6 \u03bb(dv),\nyielding finally\n(12)\n\n{\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb(v) = (\u22121)q(p+1) [b, Sa (v)] + (\u22121)p [a, Sb (v)]\n+ (\u22121)(p+1)(q+1) \u0398b \u25e6 \u0398a \u25e6 \u03bb(dv).\n\n\f12\n\nGREGORY LUPTON AND SAMUEL BRUCE SMITH\n\nThe formulae of the previous section may be extended to iterated Whitehead\nproducts. We sketch this here.

Let \u03c8 : (L, dL ) \u2192 (K, dK ) be a map between connected DG Lie algebras with (L, dL ) finitely generated and minimal. Suppose \u03c6 : (K, dK ) \u2192 (K \u2032 , dK \u2032 )\nis a surjective DG Lie algebra map such that H(\u03c6) : H\u2217 (K) \u2192 H\u2217 (K \u2032 ) is an isomorphism. Then composition with \u03c6 induces isomorphisms\n\u223c H\u2217 (Der(L, K \u2032 ; \u03c6\u25e6\u03c8)) and H\u2217 (Rel(ad\u03c8 )) =\n\u223c H\u2217 (Rel(ad\u03c6\u25e6\u03c8 )).\nH\u2217 (Der(L, K; \u03c8)) =\nFurther, these are isomorphisms of Whitehead algebras with all spaces equipped with\nthe Whitehead products constructed in Theorem 3.6 and Corollary 3.7.\nProof. Write \u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8; for a cycle \u03b6a = (\u03c7a , \u03b8a ) \u2208 Rel(ad\u03c8 ), use \u03b6a\u2032 to denote\nthe corresponding cycle (\u03c6(\u03c7a ), \u03c6\u2217 \u25e6 \u03b8a ) \u2208 Rel(ad\u03c8\u2032 ). Then \u03c6 \u25e6 (\u03b6a | \u03b6b )\u03c8 = (\u03b6a\u2032 |\n\u03b6b\u2032 )\u03c8\u2032 : L(a, b) \u2192 K \u2032 , and we have a commutative diagram as follows:\nK bF\nFF\nFF(\u03b6a |\u03b6b )\u03c8\nFF\nFF\n\u03c6\nL(a, b)\nx\nx\nxx\nx\nxx \u2032 \u2032\n\u000f |xx (\u03b6a |\u03b6b )\u03c8\u2032\n\u2032\nK\n\nad\u03c8\n\nad\u03bb\n\nK; \u03c8)\n\u0001 / Der(L,\n6\n(\u03b6a |\u03b6b )\u03c8 llll\nll\u2217l\nlll\nlll\n/ Der(L, L(a, b); \u03bb)\n\u03c6\u2217\n\u0001\nRRR\n\u2032\n|\u03b6b\u2032 )\u03c8\u2032\nRR(\u03b6\na\n\u2217\nRRR\nRRR\nRR(\n\u000f\n/ Der(L, K \u2032 ; \u03c8 \u2032 )\n\nad\u03c8\u2032\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the map \u03c6 induces a commutative diagram of long exact\nhomology sequences of the respective adjoints ad\u03c8 and ad\u03c8\u2032 , and also that the\n\n\fWHITEHEAD PRODUCTS IN FUNCTION SPACES\n\n13\n\nconstruction of our Whitehead product is natural with respect to the maps induced\nby composition with \u03c6.\nThus by the Five-Lemma it suffices to prove composition with \u03c6 induces an\nisomorphism H\u2217 (Der(L, K; \u03c8)) \u223c\n= H\u2217 (Der(L, K \u2032 ; \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8)). The proof of this fact is\nan adaptation of a standard result for lifting maps with domain a minimal DG Lie\nalgebra (see [5, Prop.22.11]). We give the full details to show composition by \u03c6\ninduces a surjection on homology. The proof of injectivity is similar and so we omit\nit.\nWrite L = L(V ; dL ) where V = Q(x1 , . . . , xn ) and the xi are homogeneous of\nnondecreasing degree. Let \u03b8\u2032 \u2208 Derp (L, K \u2032 ; \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8) be a D-cycle where we write\nD = D\u03c6\u25e6\u03c8 . We define \u03b8 \u2208 Derp (L, K; \u03c8) and a derivation \u03b8\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Derp+1 (L, K \u2032 ; \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8)\nso that\n(15)\n\nD\u03c8 (\u03b8) = 0 and \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b8 = \u03b8\u2032 + D(\u03b8\u2032\u2032 ).\n\nWe define \u03b8 and \u03b8\u2032\u2032 on our basis for V by induction.\nObserve that, since dL (x1 ) = 0, dK \u2032 (\u03b8\u2032 (x1 )) = D(\u03b8\u2032 )(x1 ) = 0. Since \u03c6 : K \u2192\n\u2032\nK induces a homology isomorphism we can choose a dK -cycle \u03c7 \u2208 K such that\n\u03c6(\u03c7) = \u03b8\u2032 (x1 ) + dK \u2032 (\u03b1) for some \u03b1 \u2208 K \u2032 . We set \u03b8(x1 ) = \u03c7 and \u03b8\u2032\u2032 (x1 ) = \u03b1.\nNow suppose \u03b8(xj ) and \u03b8\u2032\u2032 (xj ) are defined for j < r, such that (15) holds on the\nLie subalgebra L(x1 , . . . , xr\u22121 ) of L. Set y = (\u22121)p \u03b8(dL (xr )) \u2208 K. Applying our\ninduction hypothesis, we see dK (y) = 0. Furthermore, since D(\u03b8\u2032 ) = 0, we have\ndK \u2032 (\u03b8\u2032 (xr )) = (\u22121)p \u03b8\u2032 (dL (xr ))\n= \u03c6(y) + (\u22121)p+1 D(\u03b8\u2032\u2032 )(dL (xr ))\n\n= \u03c6(y) + (\u22121)p+1 dK \u2032 (\u03b8\u2032\u2032 (dL (xr ))).\n\nThus \u03c6(y) is a boundary in (K \u2032 , dK \u2032 ) and so we can choose z \u2208 K with dK (z) = y.\nNext note that \u03b8\u2032 (xr ) + (\u22121)p \u03b8\u2032\u2032 (dL (xr )) \u2212 \u03c6(z) is a dK \u2032 -cycle. Thus, as above, we\ncan find a dK -cycle z and \u03b1 \u2208 K \u2032 such that\n\u03c6(z) = \u03b8\u2032 (xr ) + (\u22121)p \u03b8\u2032\u2032 (dL (xr )) \u2212 \u03c6(z) + dK \u2032 (\u03b1).\nWe put \u03b8(xr ) = z + z and \u03b8\u2032\u2032 (xr ) = \u03b1 and (15) is satisfied on L(x1 , . . . , xr ).\n\n\u0003\n\n5. Whitehead Product Formulae for Function Space Components\nIn this section we return to the topological setting and prove our main result,\nthe identification of the Whitehead product in the rational homotopy groups of a\nfunction space component. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a map between simply connected CW\ncomplexes of finite type with X now a finite complex. Let Lf : (LX , dX ) \u2192 (LY , dY )\nbe the Quillen minimal model for f.

By Theorem 2.1, the Quillen minimal\nmodel for A is a map\n\u0001\nLA : LX (a), \u2202a \u2192 (LY , dY ).\nDefine \u03b8a \u2208 Derp (LX , LY ; Lf ) by setting \u03b8a (v) = LA (Sa (v)) for v \u2208 V and extending as an Lf -derivation. Then \u03c7a = (\u22121)p LA (a) is a cycle of degree p \u2212 1 in LY ,\nand \u03b6a = (\u03c7a , \u03b8a ) \u2208 Relp (adLf ) is a \u03b4adLf -cycle.

Denote by L the composite of the Sullivan and the Quillen functors. That\nis, we write L(Z) to denote the DG Lie algebra obtained by applying the Quillen\nfunctor to the coalgebra dual of A\u2217 (Z), which is the Sullivan functor applied to Z.\n(See [5, Sec. 22(e)] or [15, I.1(7)].) For a space Z, denote by \u03b7Z : LZ \u2192 L(Z) the\nQuillen minimal model of Z. To establish the Lemma, we want the diagram\n(\u03b6a |\u03b6b )Lf\n\nLX (a, b)\n\n/ LY\n\n\u03b7(S p \u2228S q )\u00d7X\n\n\u03b7Y\n\n\u000f\n\u0001\nL (S p \u2228 S q ) \u00d7 X\n\nL\n\n(A|B)f\n\n\u000f\n\u0001 / L(Y ).\n\nto be homotopy commutative, in the DG lie algebra sense. Following [15, II.5.(20)],\nthis means we seek a DG Lie algebra map H : LX (a,\n\u0001 b) \u2192 (t, dt) \u2297 L(Y ) such that\np0 \u25e6 H = \u03b7Y \u25e6 (\u03b6a | \u03b6b )Lf and p1 \u25e6 H = L (A | B)f \u25e6 \u03b7(S p \u2228S q )\u00d7X .

We will obtain our homotopy H by\npushing out homotopies from LX (a) and LX (b).

We have no immediate need for this, and so we\nomit details.\n6. Whitehead Length of Function Space Components\nWe apply our formulae to study the Whitehead length of function space components. To begin, we make some remarks concerning the sensitivity of the invariants\nWL(map(X, Y ; f )) and WL(map\u2217 (X, Y ; f ))\nto the (homotopy class of the) map f : X \u2192 Y. For example, in the case X = Y and\nf = 1, the space map(X, X; 1) is a topological monoid, and so WL(map(X, X; 1)) =\n1. When Y is an H-space, so too is map(X, Y ), and hence WL(map(X, Y ; f ) = 1\nfor any component. Dually, if X is a co-H-space, then map\u2217 (X, Y ) is an H-space,\nand hence WL(map\u2217 (X, Y ; f )) = 1 for any component of the based mapping space.\nOn the other hand, we have the following fact concerning the null-component which\nshows that we may easily have an abundance of non-zero Whitehead products in\u0001\nthe free function space. Recall that we are only considering \u03c0\u22652 map(X, Y ; f )\nhere.\nTheorem 6.1. Let Y be any space. Then\nmax{WL(Y ), WL(map\u2217 (X, Y ; 0))} \u2264 WL(map(X, Y ; 0)).\nIf the universal cover of Y has finite rational type then\nWLQ (map(X, Y ; 0)) = WLQ (Y ).\n\n\f18\n\nGREGORY LUPTON AND SAMUEL BRUCE SMITH\n\nProof. The first inequality follows from the evaluation fibration map\u2217 (X, Y ; 0) \u2192\nmap(X, Y ; 0) \u2192 Y . On the one hand, the obvious section s : Y \u2192 map(X, Y ; 0)\nimplies that Y is a retract of map(X, Y ; 0). On the other hand, s implies that the\nfibre inclusion map\u2217 (X, Y ; 0) \u2192 map(X, Y ; 0) induces an injection on homotopy\ngroups.\nFor the rational result, we start with a nice observation of Brown-Szczarba [2]:\nwriting \u03a90 Y for the connected component of the constant loop in \u03a9Y , we have\n\u03a90 (map(X, Y ; 0)) \u2248 map(X, \u03a90 Y ; 0). Next, by [8, Th.4.10]\nHnil(map(X, \u03a90 Y ; 0)) = Hnil(\u03a90 Y )\nwhere Hnil(G) of a loop-space G denotes the homotopical nilpotency of G in the\nsense of Berstein-Ganea [1]. Taking Y = YQ the result follows from the identity\nHnil(\u03a90 YQ ) = WLQ (Y ) [14, Th.3].\n\u0003\nRecall that a simply connected space Y is coformal if there is a DG Lie algebra\nmap \u03c1 : (LY , dY ) \u2192 (\u03c0\u2217 (\u03a9Y ) \u2297 Q, 0) inducing an isomorphism on homology (see [5,\np.334 Ex.7]).\nTheorem 6.2. Let X be a finite simply connected CW complex and Y a simply\nconnected coformal complex of finite type. Then for all f : X \u2192 Y we have\nmax{WLQ (map\u2217 (X, Y ; f )), WLQ (map(X, Y ; f ))} \u2264 WLQ (Y ).\nProof. By Theorem 4.1, we may replace (LY , dY ) by (H(LY ), 0) = (\u03c0\u2217 (\u03a9Y ) \u2297 Q, 0)\nwhen we apply Theorem 5.3. We say that a cycle \u03b6 = (\u03c7, \u03b8) \u2208 Rel\u2217 (adLf ) is of\nlength \u2265 r in H(LY ) if \u03c7 \u2208 H(LY ) is of bracket length \u2265 r and, when applied to a\ngenerator v \u2208 L(V ) = LX , \u03b8(v) is also of bracket length \u2265 r in H(LY ). The result\nis proved by arguing that iterated Whitehead products in H\u2217 (Rel(adLf )) of length\nr are represented by cycles of length \u2265 r in H(LY ).\nTo see this, consider two cycles \u03b6a and \u03b6b , and suppose that \u03b6a is of length \u2265 r\nin H(LY ). According to (12), {\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb(v) is contained in the ideal of LX (a, b)\ngenerated by a and Sa (v), and also is of length \u2265 2. Therefore, when the map\n(\u03b6a | \u03b6b )Lf is applied to it, we obtain an element of bracket length \u2265 (r + 1) in\nH(L\nY ).\n\u0002\n\u0003 Likewise for the bracket [a, b]. It follows that a cocycle representative of\n[\u03b6a , \u03b6b ] is of length \u2265 (r + 1) in H(LY ). An easy induction using this completes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nWe say a simply connected CW complex X is a rational co-H-space if XQ is\nhomotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. We remarked above that, if X is a coH-space, then Whitehead products vanish in any component of the based mapping\nspace. The following result provides a large class of examples of free function spaces\nwith vanishing rational Whitehead products.\nTheorem 6.3. Let X be a finite rational co-H-space and Y a simply connected, coformal complex of finite type. Suppose f induces a surjection on rational homotopy\ngroups. Then WLQ (map(X, Y ; f )) = 1.\nProof. Since X is a rational co-H-space, the differential dX in the Quillen minimal\nmodel for X vanishes. Since Y is coformal, we may replace (LY , dY ) by (H(LY ), 0),\nand view Lf as a map LX \u2192 H(LY ), when we apply Theorem 5.3. Suppose given\na pair \u03b6a = (\u03c7a , \u03b8a ) \u2208 Relp (adLf ) and \u03b6b = (\u03c7b , \u03b8b ) \u2208 Relq (adLf ) of \u03b4adLf -cycles;\n\n\fWHITEHEAD PRODUCTS IN FUNCTION SPACES\n\n19\n\nwith \u03c7a , \u03c7b \u2208 H(LY ) and \u03b8a , \u03b8b \u2208 Der\u2217 (LX , H(LY ); Lf ). Using the fact that\n(\u03b6a | \u03b6b )Lf : LX (a, b) \u2192 H(LY )\n\n\u0001\nis a DG Lie algebra map, we see that [\u03c7a , Lf (v)] = \u00b1(\u03b6a | \u03b6b )Lf \u2202a,b Sa (v) = 0, for\nany v \u2208 LX . By assumption, Lf is surjective and it follows that the bracket of \u03c7a\nwith any element of H(LY ) is zero. A similar argument yields the same conclusion\nfor \u03c7b . Finally, we obtain from (12)\nthat {\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb(v) = \u00b1[b, Sa (v)] \u00b1 [a, Sb (v)].\n\u0001\nIt follows that in H\u2217 Rel(adLf ) , we have\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0001\n[\u03b6a , \u03b6b ] = \u00b1 [\u03c7a , \u03c7b ], \u00b1[\u03c7a , \u03b8b (v)] \u00b1 [\u03c7b , \u03b8a (v)] = (0, 0).\nThe result follows from Theorem 5.3.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn [6], Ganea proved WL(map\u2217 (X, Y ; 0)) \u2264 cat(X). We give a rational version\nof this inequality which applies to all components. Recall the rational cone length\ncl0 (X) of a space X is the least integer n such that X has the rational homotopy\ntype of an n-cone (see [5, p.359]). Spaces of rational cone length 1 then correspond\nto rational co-H-spaces.\nTheorem 6.4. Let X be a finite CW complex and Y a simply connected complex\nof finite type. Then WLQ (map\u2217 (X, Y ; f )) \u2264 cl0 (X) for all maps f : X \u2192 Y.\nProof. Let n = cl0 (X). By [5, Th.29.1], the underlying vector space V of the\nQuillen minimal model of X admits a filtration {0} \u2282 V (1) \u2282 V (2) \u2282 * * * \u2282 V (n) =\nV where dX (V (i)) \u2286 L(V (i \u2212 1)). The result is proved by arguing that iterated\nWhitehead products in H\u2217 (Der(LX , LY ; Lf )) of length r are represented by cycles\nthat vanish on V (r \u2212 1). We argue in a similar fashion to the proof of Theorem 6.2.\nConsider two cycles \u03b8a , \u03b8b \u2208 Der(LX , LY ; Lf ). Recall that their Whitehead\nproduct is represented by the image of the universal example\n{\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb \u2208 Der(LX , LX (a, b); \u03bb)\nunder the map\n(\u03b6a\u2217 | \u03b6b\u2217 )Lf\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2217\n\n: Der(LX , LX (a, b); \u03bb) \u2192 Der(LX , LY ; Lf ).\n\nHere \u03b6a\u2217 = (0, \u03b8a ) and \u03b6b\u2217 = (0, \u03b8b ) in Rel(adLf ). In particular, (\u03b6a\u2217 | \u03b6b\u2217 )Lf maps a\nand b to zero.\nFrom (12), we see that {\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb(v) \u2261 \u00b1\u0398b \u25e6 \u0398a (dX (v)) modulo terms in\nthe ideal generated by a and b. Now assume that \u0398a vanishes on V (r). Since\ndX (V (r + 1)) \u2286 L(V (r)), we have that {\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb vanishes on V (r + 1). An easy\ninduction using this completes the proof.\n\u0003\nWe next give a complete calculation of the rational Whitehead length of function\nspaces in a special case. Let X be a simply connected, finite complex and S n a\nsphere with n \u2265 2. When n is odd, S n is a rational H-space and hence so too is\nmap(X, S n ). It follows that, after rationalization, each component of map(X, S n ) is\nhomotopy equivalent to the null component, which itself is an H-space; in particular\nwe have WLQ (map(X, S n ; f )) = 1. Identical remarks apply to the based function\nspace.\nWhen n is even, the rational homotopy types of components map(X, S n ; f ) are\nmore complicated. A complete description for X rationally (2n + 1)-co-connected\nis given by M\u00f8ller-Raussen [12, Th.1]. We compute the rational Whitehead length\n\n\f20\n\nGREGORY LUPTON AND SAMUEL BRUCE SMITH\n\nof all components in both the based and free setting without dimension restriction\non X.\nSince S n is a coformal space, WLQ (map\u2217 (X, S n ; f )) and WLQ (map(X, S n ; f ))\nare each equal to either 1 or 2-but not a priori equal to each other-by Theorem 6.2. Suppose first that H(f ; Q) = 0 : H \u2217 (S n ; Q) \u2192 H \u2217 (X; Q). Then the\nrationalization of f factors through the fibre K(Q, 2n \u2212 1) of the Postnikov decomposition K(Q, 2n \u2212 1) \u2192 (S n )Q \u2192 K(Q, n). This implies f is a rationally\ncyclic map (see [11, Def.2.4 and Ex.4.4]). By [9, Th.3.7], the evaluation fibration\n\u03c9 : map(X, S n ; f ) \u2192 S n is then rationally fibre-homotopically trivial and, from the\nlong exact homotopy sequence, we have an isomorphism of Whitehead algebras:\n\u03c0\u2217 (map(X, S n ; f ))\u2297Q, [ , ]w \u223c\n= (\u03c0\u2217 (map (X, S n ; f )) \u2297 Q, [ , ]w )\u2295(\u03c0\u2217 (S n ) \u2297 Q, [ , ]w ) .\n\u2217\n\nSince WLQ (S n ) = 2, we have WLQ (map(X, S n ; f )) = 2 and WLQ (map\u2217 (X, S n ; f ))\nis equal to either 1 or 2 in this case.\nSuppose H(f ; Q) 6= 0. Write (LS n , dS n ) = L(u; 0) with |u| = n \u2212 1 and LX =\nL(V ; dX ). The condition H(f ; Q) 6= 0 translated to Quillen models implies there\nexists v \u2208 Vn\u22121 with Lf (v) = u. This implies there are no cycles (u, \u03b8) \u2208 Reln (adLf )\nbecause adLf (u) + DLf (\u03b8) cannot equal zero: note that \u03b8(dX (v)) = 0 for degree\nreasons, and then applied to v we obtain that\nadLf (u)(v)+DLf (\u03b8)(v) = [u, Lf (v)]+dS n \u03b8(v)\u00b1\u03b8(dX (v)) = [u, u] 6= 0 \u2208 (LS n )2n\u22122 .\nBy the formula for the Whitehead product in H\u2217 (Rel(adLf )) (Theorem 3.6), we see\ndirectly that the cycle ([u, u], 0) \u2208 Rel2n\u22121 (adLf ) does not represent a Whitehead\nproduct. Translating back, this means\n\u03c0\u2217 (map(X, S n ; f )) \u2297 Q, [ , ]w \u223c\n= (\u03c0\u2217 (map (X, S n ; f )) \u2297 Q, [ , ]w ) \u2295 (Q([\u03b9, \u03b9]w ), 0)\n\u2217\n\nn\n\nwhere \u03b9 \u2208 \u03c0n (S ) is nontrivial and (Q([\u03b9, \u03b9]w ), 0) denotes the abelian Whitehead\nalgebra generated in degree 2n \u2212 1. Thus in this case\nWLQ (map(X, S n ; f )) = WLQ (map\u2217 (X, S n ; f )) = 1 or 2.\nIn both cases, the relevant question is the rational Whitehead length of the based\nfunction space. We address this question as an application of our formula:\nTheorem 6.5. Let X be a finite, simply connected CW complex and f : X \u2192 S n a\nbased map with n even. Then WLQ (map\u2217 (X, S n ; f )) = 2 if and only if there exists\na pair x, y \u2208 H \u2264n\u22122 (X; Q) satisfying:\n(i) xy 6= 0,\n(ii) xz 6= 0 or yz 6= 0 for z \u2208 H n (X; Q) =\u21d2 H(f ; Q)(z) = 0 and\n(iii) xy = wz for some z \u2208 H n (X; Q) and any w =\u21d2 H(f ; Q)(z) = 0\nOtherwise, WLQ (map\u2217 (X, S n ; f )) = 1.\nAs for the free function space, if H(f ; Q) = 0 then WLQ (map(X, S n ; f )) = 2.\nOtherwise, WLQ (map(X, S n ; f )) = WLQ (map\u2217 (X, S n ; f )), as given above.\nProof. The results for the free function space follow from the discussion preceding\nthe statement of the theorem. Thus we focus on the based function space and so\nthe space H\u2217 (Der(LX , LS n ; Lf )) with Whitehead product given by Corollary 3.7.\nWrite LX = L(V ; dX ) and LS n = L(u; 0). Given a homogeneous basis {v1 , . . . , vs }\ne \u2217 (X; Q), we will assume the vectors are in nondecreasing order of\nfor V = s\u22121 H\ndegree. If H(f ; Q) 6= 0, we will further assume that there is some basis vector\nvk \u2208 Vn\u22121 such that Lf (vk ) = ck u while Lf (vi ) = 0 for any other basis element vi\n\n\fWHITEHEAD PRODUCTS IN FUNCTION SPACES\n\n21\n\nof degree n \u2212 1. Here ck 6= 0. For convenience, we allow the case ck = 0 so that\nH(f ; Q) = 0 if and only if ck = 0.\nWe recall the quadratic part of the differential dX is dual to the cup product\nin H \u2217 (X; Q) (see [15, Sec.I.1.(10)] and [5, Sec.22e]). Let {x1 , . . . , xs } be the corree \u2217 (X; Q), that is, xi = s(vi ). Given any v \u2208 V we may\nsponding additive basis of H\nwrite\nX\n(18)\ndX (v) =\ncij (v)[vi , vj ] + longer length terms\ni\u2264j\n\nwith cij (v) \u2208 Q and cii (v) = 0 for vi of even degree. As a direct consequence of\nthis duality we have that the cup product xi xj = 0 if and only if cij (v) = 0 for all\nv \u2208 V. We make use of this repeatedly below.\nLet \u03b8 \u2208 Derp (LX , LS n ; Lf ). Using (18), we have\nX\nX\nDLf (\u03b8)(v) = \u00b1\u03b8(dX v) = \u00b1\ncik (v)[\u03b8(vi ), Lf (vk )] = \u00b1\nck cik (v)[\u03b8(vi ), u].\ni\u2264k\n\ni\u2264k\n\nIt follows that \u03b8 is a cycle if \u03b8(vi ) = 0 for all vi in Vn\u22121\u2212p . If \u03b8(vi ) 6= 0 for\nsome vi \u2208 Vn\u22121\u2212p we may alter our basis in this degree so that \u03b8(vj ) = \u03b4ij u for\nvj \u2208 Vn\u22121\u2212p where \u03b4ij is the Kronecker delta function. Then we see \u03b8 is a cycle\nif and only if ck cik (v) = 0 for all v \u2208 V. Translating, we have shown a derivation\n\u03b8 \u2208 Derp (LX , LS n ; Lf ) not vanishing on Vn\u22121\u2212p is a cycle if and only if there exists\nx \u2208 H \u2264n\u22122 (X; Q) such that xz 6= 0 implies H(f ; Q)(z) = 0 for all z \u2208 H n (X; Q).\nNext let \u03b8a , \u03b8b \u2208 Der(LX , LS n ; Lf ) be cycles of degree p and q, respectively. As\nin the discussion preceding Corollary 3.7, let \u03b6x\u2217 = (0, \u03b8x ) \u2208 Rel(adLf ), x = a, b, be\nthe corresponding cycles so that, by (11), the derivation cycle\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[\u03b8a , \u03b8b ] = (\u03b6a\u2217 | \u03b6b\u2217 )Lf \u25e6 {\u0398a , \u0398b } \u25e6 \u03bb \u2208 Derp+q\u22121 (LX , LS n ; Lf )\n\nrepresents [h\u03b8a i, h\u03b8b i]w . Using (18) again, (12) and the fact that (\u03b6a\u2217 | \u03b6b\u2217 )Lf (x) = 0\nfor x = a, b, we obtain\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[\u03b8a , \u03b8b ] (v) = \u00b1(\u03b6a\u2217 | \u03b6b\u2217 )Lf \u25e6 \u0398b \u25e6 \u0398a \u25e6 \u03bb(dX v)\nX\nX\n2cii (v)[\u03b8a (vi ), \u03b8b (vi )].\n\u00b1cij (v) ([\u03b8a (vi ), \u03b8b (vj )] \u00b1 [\u03b8b (vi ), \u03b8a (vj )]) \u00b1\n=\ni<j\n\ni\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nFrom this we conclude that [\u03b8a , \u03b8b ] nonvanishing for derivation cycles \u03b8a , \u03b8b implies\n\u03b8a (vi ) 6= 0 for some vi \u2208 Vn\u22121\u2212p and \u03b8b (vj ) 6= 0 for some vj \u2208 Vn\u22121\u2212q and for this\ni, j we have cij (v) 6= 0 for some v \u2208 V. By the above computation, the fact that\n\u03b8a and \u03b8b are cycles implies ck cik (w) = ck cjk (w) = 0 for all w \u2208 V. Conversely,\nsuppose there exist indices i, j such that cij (v) 6= 0 and ck cik (w) = ck cjk (w) = 0 for\nall w \u2208 V. Then define \u03b8a , \u03b8b by setting \u03b8a (vl ) = \u03b4li u and \u03b8b (vl ) = \u03b4lj u and extend\nby the Lf -derivation law. By \u0002the preceding\nparagraph, the \u03b8a and \u03b8b are derivation\n\u0003\ncycles. Computing as above [\u03b8a , \u03b8b ] (v) = \u00b1cij [u, u] is non-vanishing. Combining\nand\nto cohomology, we have shown that there exists a nontrivial pairing\n\u0002 translating\n\u0003\n[\u03b8a , \u03b8b ] \u2208 Derp+q\u22121 (LX , LS n ; Lf ) for cycles \u03b8a \u2208 Derp (LX , LS n ; Lf ) and \u03b8b \u2208\nDerq (LX , LS n ; Lf ) if and only if there exists a pair x, y \u2208 H \u2264n\u22122 (X; Q) satisfying\n(i) and (ii).\nsuppose \u03b8a , \u03b8b \u2208 Der(LX , LS n ; Lf ) are cycles of degree p and q with\n\u0002 Finally,\n\u0003\n[\u03b8a , \u03b8b ] 6= 0. As above, let vi \u2208 Vn\u22121\u2212p and vj \u2208 Vn\u22121\u2212q be basis elements so that\n\u03b8a (vi ) 6= 0 and \u03b8b (vj ) 6= 0. If p 6= q we arrange our basis in degree n \u2212 1 \u2212 p and\nn\u22121\u2212q so that \u03b8a (vl ) = \u03b4il u and \u03b8b (vm ) = \u03b4jm u for vl \u2208 Vn\u22121\u2212p and vm \u2208 Vn\u22121\u2212q .\n\n\f22\n\nGREGORY LUPTON AND SAMUEL BRUCE SMITH\n\nIf p = q, we must allow for the case vi = vj . In this case, we may arrange the basis\nin degree n \u2212 1 \u2212 p so that \u03b8a (vl ) = ca \u03b4il u and \u03b8b (vm ) = cb \u03b4jm u for vl , vm \u2208 Vn\u22121\u2212p .\nHere ca , cb 6= 0 and can be taken to be 1 when i 6= j. We use this identification in\nall cases by taking ca = 1 and cb = 1 except, perhaps, when i = j.\nLet x = s(vi ) \u2208 H n\u2212p (X; Q) and y = s(vj ) \u2208 H n\u2212q (X; Q) be the corresponding\n\u0002\n\u0003 cohomology elements. Then the pair x, y satisfy (i) and (ii).

Conversely, if x, y violate\n(iii) then ck 6= 0 and there exists some v \u2208 V2n\u22121\u2212p\u2212q such that cij (v) 6= 0 and\ncrk (v) 6= 0 for some index r.

We then see\nDLf (\u03b8)(v) = \u00b1ck crk (v)[u, u] 6= 0 while [\u03b8a , \u03b8b ] (v) = \u00b1c\n\u0002 a cb cij\u0003(v)[u, u] 6= 0. To complete the proof, we show the derivations DLf (\u03b8) and [\u03b8a , \u03b8b ] differ by a constant.\nNote that both derivations increase bracket length. This implies they both vanish on V except in degree 2n \u2212 1 \u2212 p \u2212 q. In this degree, they are linear maps\nV2n\u22121\u2212p\u2212q \u2192 Q([u, u]).

Since the target is one-dimensional, there is a constant c 6= 0 such\nthat [\u03b8a , \u03b8b ] = cDLf (\u03b8) = DLf (c\u03b8), as needed.\n\u0003\nWe conclude with an example realizing the inequality\nWLQ (map(X, Y ; f )) > WLQ (map(X, Y ; 0)) = WLQ (Y )\nfor some map f : X \u2192 Y.\nExample 6.6. Let X = S 3 , and let Y be a space with Sullivan minimal model\n\u039b(x1 , x2 , x3 , y; d), the free DG algebra with generators of degrees |x1 | = 2, |x2 | =\n|x3 | = 3, and |y| = 7. Define the (degree +1) differential here by setting d(xi ) = 0\nand d(y7 ) = x1 x2 x3 . Then Y has vanishing Whitehead products since d has no\nquadratic term [5, Prop.13.16]. Consequently, WLQ (map(X, Y ; 0)) = 1 by Theorem 6.1. The Quillen minimal model (LY , dY ) for Y is of the form L(W ; dY ) where\ne \u2217 (Y, Q). We use that the quadratic part of the differential dY is dual to\nW = s\u22121 H\nthe cup-product in H \u2217 (Y, Q) (see [5, Sec.22(e)]). In low degrees, we see W contains\nelements w1 , w2 , w3 , w1,1 , w1,2 , w1,3 , w2,3 with |w1 | = 1, |w2 | = |w3 | = 2, |w1,1 | =\n3, |w1,2 | = |w1,3 | = 4 and |w2,3 | = 5.

Applying Theorem 5.3, their Whitehead product\n[\u03b1, \u03b2]w \u2208 \u03c04 (map(X, Y ; f )) \u2297 Q corresponds to the class represented by the \u03b4adLf \u0002\n\u0003\ncycle [\u03b6a , \u03b6b ] = ([w1 , w2 ], {\u03b6a , \u03b6b }) \u2208 Rel4 (adLf ); where, by using formula (12), we\nhave that {\u03b6a , \u03b6b }(v) = \u2212[w2 , w1,3 ] \u2212 [w1 , w2,3 ]. This cannot be a boundary. For if\n\u03b4adLf (\u03b7, \u03b8) = ([w1 , w2 ], {\u03b6a , \u03b6b }), then we have \u03b7 = \u2212w1,2 + \u03c7 for some \u03c7 a cycle\nin LY of degree 4. Since Y has no rational homotopy of degree 5 (direct from the\nSullivan model), we see that \u03c7 = dY (\u03be) for some \u03be \u2208 LY . Further, we then obtain\nthat\nadLf (\u2212w1,2 + dY (\u03be))(v) + DLf (\u03b8)(v) = {\u03b6a , \u03b6b }(v),\nwhich implies that\ndY ([\u03be, w3 ] + \u03b8(v)) = [w1,2 , w3 ] \u2212 [w1 , w2,3 ] \u2212 [w2 , w1,3 ].\nHowever, when dY is applied to this latter term, it yields 2[[w1 , w2 ], w3 ] and not\nzero, so it cannot be a cycle (boundary). We conclude that [\u03b1, \u03b2]w 6= 0.\nReferences\n[1] I. Berstein and T. Ganea, Homotopical nilpotency, Illinois J. Math. 5 (1961), 99\u2013130.\nMR 0126277 (23 #A3573)\n[2] E. H.
