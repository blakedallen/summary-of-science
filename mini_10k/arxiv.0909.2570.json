One of the remarkable exhibitions of the fascination of quantum information science\nis quantum teleportation [1], which can transmit an unknown\nstate from one location to another without sending a physical copy of the initial state. Remote state preparation (RSP),\nwhich is another significant application of entanglement, has\nbeen proposed recently [2, 3, 4]. Unlike teleportation, however, in RSP Alice (the sender) knows completely the desired\nstate. Alice is supposed to help Bob (the receiver) prepare the\ndesired state at a remote location with the aid of her complete\nknowledge of the desired state, prior shared entanglement and\nclassical communications.\nIn recent years, RSP has attracted much attention, and various approaches towards RSP have been studied experimentally with varying degrees of control over remotely prepared\nqubits. Using liquid-state NMR, remote preparation of pseudopure states is experimentally realized firstly [5]. Since then,\nthe experimental remote preparation of several kinds of constrained states have also been reported [6, 7, 8, 9]. RSP can\neven be realized with classical correlations instead of quantum correlations (i.e., entanglement) [10]. Recently, arbitrary\nremote control of single-qubit state have been experimentally\nrealized [11, 12, 13, 14]. In Ref. [11], the trigger photon\nand the remote photon are entangled in a Bell state, thus projection measurement on the trigger photon in a basis which\ncontains the desired state will project the remote photon into\nthe desired state or a state orthogonal to the desired state. Due\nto the impossibility of a universal NOT operation on arbitrary\nqubit states [15], the efficiency for remote preparation of pure\nstates are only 50%. The efficiencies for remote preparation\nof mixed states depends on the desired state, and are at least\n50%. The efficiency can be 100% only if the desired state\nis constrained to lie on a single great circle on the Poincar\u00e9\nsphere. In Ref. [12], the efficiencies for remote preparation of\narbitrary qubit states (including pure states and mixed states)\nalso depend on the desired state, which are at least 50%. In\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: weiwu@nudt.edu.cn\n\nRef. [13, 14], both the polarization and the spatial mode of the\nphoton are considered. Polarization beam splitter (PBS) acts\nas CNOT logic gate between the polarization (control qubit)\nand spatial (target qubit) for complete Bell-state measurement\n[16, 17, 18]. The efficiencies for remote preparation of arbitrary pure states in Ref. [13, 14] are 100% at the cost of\nprecisely controlling two interferometers [19]. The efficiency\nfor remote preparation of mixed states in Ref. [14] remain\n50% owing to the impossibility of a universal NOT operation.\nThus far, to our best knowledge, there is no RSP implementation which realize remote preparation of arbitrary single-qubit\nstates (including pure states and mixed states) deterministically.\nIn this paper, we report the first experimental demonstration\nof deterministic remote preparation of arbitrary single-photon\npolarization states, where entanglement, local operation and\nclassical communications (LOCC) are employed. By virtue\nof positive operator-valued measures (POVM), we can realize deterministic remote preparation of arbitrary pure states\nat a cost of one entanglement bit (ebit) and two classical bits\n(cbits). By combining POVM and controlled decoherence, we\ncan also achieve deterministic remote preparation of arbitrary\nmixed states. The communication costs are the same as that\nin remote preparation of pure states. Furthermore, instead of\ntwo Mach-Zehnder interferometers in Ref. [13, 14], only one\ninterferometer is needed in our scheme. This kind of simplification makes our scheme more feasible and executable in\npossible practical applications. In order to evaluate the performance of our scheme, we remotely prepare 12 pure states\nand 6 mixed states. The fidelities between the desired and\nachieved states are all higher than 0.99 and have an average of\n0.9947.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nTHEORETICAL PROTOCOL\n\nDeterministic implementation of arbitrary POVM on\nsingle-photon polarization state\n\nPOVM on single-photon polarization state plays a crucial\nrole in our RSP protocol. So it would be the best to start from\nthe deterministic realization of arbitrary POVM on singlephoton polarization state with linear optics elements.\nPOVM is the most general class of quantum measurement\n\n\f2\n\nq1\n\nOutput1\n\nPOVM Module\n\nU1\n\nVPR2\n\np2\nV\n\nq2\nOutput2\n\nPBS2\n\nX U2\n\nVPR1\n\nInput\n\nPBS1\n\np1\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic diagram of the module which can implement\narbitrary two-outcome POVM on single-photon polarization state.\nPBS: polarizing beam splitters; VPR: variable polarization rotator;\nX: NOT operator. V, U1 and U2 are variable unitary operators.\n\n[20], which can be described by a collection of operators\n{Mm }. The subscript m labels the possible measurement outcomes. If the system state to be measured is described by a\ndensity matrix \u03c1, then after the measurement the system state\nbecomes\n\u03c1m =\n\nMm \u03c1Mm\u2020\ntr(Mm\u2020 Mm \u03c1)\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nand the corresponding probability is given by pm =\ntr(Mm\u2020 Mm \u03c1). The measurement operators {Mm } satisfy the\nP\ncompleteness equation m Mm\u2020 Mm = I, where I is unit matrix.\n\u2020\nIf we define\nPthat Em \u2261 Mm Mm , then Em will be a positive operator and m Em = I. The operators Em are called POVM elements of the measurement and the complete set {Em } is called\na POVM [21].\nAs discussed in Ref. [22], the module sketched in Fig. 1\ncan be used to implement arbitrary two-outcome POVM on\nsingle-photon polarization state. The main part of the module\nis an interferometer consisted of two polarizing beam splitters (PBS) and the relative phase between two arms is zero.\nTwo variable polarization rotators (VPR) in the interferometer controls the polarization state in path state |p1 i or |p2 i\nrespectively. The module also contains unitary operator V at\nthe entrance of the interferometer, unitary operator U1 at the\nexit q1 and unitary operator U2 plus NOT operator X at the\nexit q2 . Consider the case where V = U1 = U2 = I, and\nthe polarization states in path state |p1 i and |p2 i are rotated as\nfollows:\nV PR1\n\n|Hi \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 cos \u03b6|Hi + sin \u03b6ei\u03b8 |Vi;\nV PR2\n\n|Vi \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 cos \u03be|Hi + sin \u03beei\u03c3 |Vi.\n\n(2)\n\nIf a state in the form of |\u03c6i = a|Hi + b|Vi(|a| + |b| = 1) enters\nthe module shown in Fig. 1, the state evolves as\n2\n\n2\n\n|\u03c6i \u2192\n\u2212 (a cos \u03b6|Hi + b sin \u03bee |Vi)|q1 i\n+(a sin \u03b6ei\u03b8 |Hi + b cos \u03be|Vi)|q2 i.\ni\u03c3\n\n(3)\n\nIf one measures the output states, the output of |q1 i and |q2 i\ncorrespond to matrices D1 and D2 respectively:\n!\n!\ncos \u03b6\n0\nsin \u03b6ei\u03b8 0\nD1 =\n, D2 =\n. (4)\n0 sin \u03beei\u03c3\n0\ncos \u03be\n\nNote that D\u20201 D1 + D\u20202 D2 = I, so when V = U1 = U2 = I any\ntwo-outcome POVM described by D1 and D2 can be realized\nwith this module.\nAs we know, any square matrix A has its singular value\ndecomposition. That means there exist unitary matrices U\nand V, and a diagonal matrix D with non-negative entries\nsuch that A=UDV. The diagonal elements of D are called\nthe singular values of A [21]. So we represent the measurement operators {M1 , M2 } of arbitrary two-outcome POVM as:\nM1 = U1 D1 V1 , M2 = U20 D2 V2 . The moduli of the elements\nof the diagonal matrix D1 or D2 are confined to lie between 0\nand 1. As required by the completeness equation E1 + E2 = I,\nE1 + E2 = V1\u2020 D\u20201 D1 V1 + V2\u2020 D\u20202 D2 V2\n= V1\u2020 D\u20201 D1 V1 + V2\u2020 (I \u2212 D\u20201 D1 )V2\n= I + (V1\u2020 D\u20201 D1 V1 \u2212 V2\u2020 D\u20201 D1 V2 ) = I.\n\n(5)\n\nFrom Eq. (5), it is easy to prove that V2 = WV1 where W is\nonly a diagonal unitary matrix. Notice that W is commute with\ndiagonal matrix D2 , so if we choose V = V1 in the entrance,\nU1 operator in the exit q1 and U2 = U20 W in the exit q2 , we\ncan implement arbitrary collection of operators {M1 , M2 },\n!\n!\ncos \u03b6\n0\nsin \u03b6ei\u03b8 0\nM1 = U 1\nV, M2 = U2\nV.\n0 sin \u03beei\u03c3\n0\ncos \u03be\n(6)\nIt means the module shown in Fig. 1 can be used to realize\narbitrary two-outcome POVM.\nThe realization of POVM in our module is deterministic\nrather than probabilistic. And any more complicated POVM\nmay be implemented by making a cascade of such modules. Our design is similar to that in Ref. [23], however the\ncomplexity of the experimental setup is significantly reduced,\nwhich makes it easier to realize as shown in our experiment.\nB.\n\nDeterministic RSP scheme for pure states\n\nIn our RSP protocol, we suppose that Alice and Bob share\na maximally entangled photon pair of the form\n1\n|\u03c8AB i = \u221a (|HA VB i + |VA HB i),\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the subscripts (A,B) label Alice and Bob, |Hi and |Vi\nlabel horizontal and vertical polarization states of photons.\nWe start from remote preparation of pure states. Consider\nthat the desired pure state is\n|\u03c6B i = \u03b1|HB i + \u03b2ei\u03c6 |VB i.\n\n(8)\n\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c6 are real\nnumbers, \u03b12 + \u03b22 = 1 and \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). The experimental\narrangement for remote preparation of pure states is sketched\nin Fig. 2. VPR1 and VPR2 are arranged to rotate the polarization component as follows:\nV PR1\n\n|Hi \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b1|Hi + \u03b2ei\u03c6 |Vi\nV PR2\n\n|Vi \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b1|Hi + \u03b2ei\u03c6 |Vi.\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\n\nExperimental setup for mixed state RSP\n\nThen the POVM module in the shadowed box implement\nPOVM described by:\n\nSHG\n\nTi:Sapphire Modelocked fs laser\n\nBBO\n\n!\n!\n\u03b1 0\n\u03b2ei\u03c6 0\n.\nM1 =\n, M2 =\n0 \u03b2ei\u03c6\n0 \u03b1\n\n(10)\n\nAlice\n\nBob\nPrism\nIF PA\n\nAfter the POVM measurement, the initial entangled state\n(7) becomes\n\u03b1|HA VB i + \u03b2ei\u03c6 |VA HB i\n\n(11a)\n\nor \u03b1|HA HB i + \u03b2ei\u03c6 |VA VB i,\n\n(11b)\n\ndepending on the measurement outcome (i.e., from which output port of the module Alice's photon flies out).\nThe whole two-photon state now can be read as\n|\u03a8AB i =\n\n1\n2\n\nAPD\n\n(12)\n\nExperimental setup for pure states RSP\nTi:Sapphire Modelocked fs laser\n\nAPD1\n\nDecoherer\n\nAPD2\n\nVPR3\n\nPBS\n\nIF PA\n\nAPD\n\nAlice\n\nVPR2\n\nAPD1\n\nPBS\n\nQP\n\nPBS\n\nAPD2\n\nVPR1\n\nPBS@45\n\n\u00b0\n\nPrism\nAPD3\n\nPBS@45\n\n\u00b0\n\nCombined with POVM that allows us to remotely prepare\narbitrary pure states deterministically, controlled decoherence\nallows us to realize deterministic remote preparation of arbitrary mixed states. The experimental arrangement for remote\npreparation of mixed states is sketched in Fig. 3, which is the\nsame as that in Fig. 2 apart from the additional VPR and the\ndecoherer.\nConsider that the desired mixed state is\n\u03c1B = p2 |\u03c6B ih\u03c6B | + q2 |\u03c6\u22a5B ih\u03c6\u22a5B |\nwith\n|\u03c6B i = \u03b1|HB i + \u03b2ei\u03c6 |VB i, |\u03c6\u22a5B i = \u03b2e\u2212i\u03c6 |HB i \u2212 \u03b1|VB i, (13)\nand h\u03c6B |\u03c6\u22a5B i = 0. Without loss of generality, we assume that\np, q are real numbers, p2 + q2 = 1, and \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c6 are the same as\nbefore. To prepare arbitrary mixed states we need to achieve\ncomplete control over all five parameters. VPR1 and VPR2\nshown in Fig. 3 are arranged to rotate the polarization component as follows:\nV PR1\n\n|Hi \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 p|Hi + q|Vi\nV PR2\n\nBob\n\nPBS@45\nAPD4\n\nDeterministic RSP scheme for mixed states\n\n|Vi \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 p|Hi + q|Vi.\n\nBBO\n\nPBS@45\n\n\u00b0\n\nFIG. 3: Experimental arrangement for remote preparation of mixed\nstates.

However, the effective coincidence window used in the experiment\nis \u223c 1ns, which is much more larger than the time delay between the distinguishable states (\u223c 650 f s). In this way, we\ntrace over the timing information during state detection to\nerase coherence between these distinguishable states, which\nis equivalent to irreversible decoherence [24, 25].

According to Alice's\nmeasurement outcome, Bob performs local unitary operation\n\u02c6 \u03c3\u0302z , \u03c3\u0302 x or \u03c3\u0302y to achieve the desired mixed state. Notice that\nI,\nan arbitrary mixed states can be remotely prepared by tuning\nfive parameters in Eq. (13) and the classical communication\nrequired is 2 bits.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENT AND RESULTS\n\nOur initial states (7) are generated with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig.\n3, a 1-mm-thick \u03b2-barium borate (BBO) crystal is pumped by\nUV laser pulses with 425 nm center wavelength and \u223c 530\nmW average power from a frequency-doubled mode-locked\nTi:Sapphire laser with \u223c 200 fs pulse duration and 76 MHz\nrepetition rate. The photons obtained in degenerate, noncollinear type-II phase matching SPDC process are prepared\nin the state of Eq. (7) after the quartz crystals compensate\nthe birefringence effects in BBO [26]. We perform ClauserHorne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality test on the entangled\nstate and find that S = 2.6640 \u00b1 0.0103(|S | \u2264 2 for any local\nrealism theory) [27].\nFor both pure and mixed states, PBS(@45o ) at the output ports of the POVM module are used to preform projection measurement on Alice's photon in the basis {|Di, |Ai}.\nThe photons are detected by single photon counting avalanche\n\nphotodiode (SAPD) (Perkin-Elmer, SPCM-AQR-16) after an\ninterference filter(10 nm FWHM). Coincidence (within a 1\nns time window) between Bob's photon and corresponding\ntrigger photon serves as classical communication. The coincidence circuit consists of a time-to-amplitude converter,\na single-channel analyzer (TAC\\SCA, ORTEC 567) and a\nuniversal time interval counter (Stanford Research Systems,\nSR620).\nIn our experiment, high visibility and long stable duration\nof the interferometer are crucial to the achievement of high\nfidelities. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the prism is utilized to compensate the path length difference (i.e., the relative phase) between two arms of the interferometer. The motor\nstage loading the prism is an ultra-precision linear motor stage\n(Newport, XMS50), and the resolution is below 1 nm which\nis precise enough for the compensattion of the path length difference.\nThe interferometer is located in a box fixed on an air cushion table to reduce the phase fluctuation. The visibility of\nthe interferometer can maintain above 97% for several minutes which makes it possible to accomplish the whole tomography process and obtain high fidelities. The relative phase\nbetween two arms should keep being zero during the remote\npreparation process, otherwise the fidelity would dramatically\ndecreased. So before the remote preparation of pure states,\nwe insert a polarizer (@45\u25e6 ) at the entrance of the POVM\nmodule. If the relative phase adjusted by the prism is set\nto be zero, the output state of the POVM module should be\n|\u03c6i = \u03b1|Hi + \u03b2ei\u03c6 |Vi. The polarization analyzer (PA) at the\noutput ports are used to perform projection measurement on\nthe output polarization state in a basis {|\u03c6i, |\u03c6\u22a5 i}. If the visibility (N\u03c6 \u2212 N\u03c6\u22a5 )/(N\u03c6 + N\u03c6\u22a5 ) is near 100 %, we can make\nsure that the relative phase is near zero and the POVM module preforms the POVM operators in Eq.(10). Because the interferometer can maintain high visibility for several minutes,\nnow we take off the polarizer and set the PA to measure in\nthe basis {|Di, |Ai}, then the stabilization time left is enough\nfor the qubit tomography at Bob' side. The manipulation of\nthe POVM module in remote preparation of mixed states is\nsimilar. In our experiment the interferometer was not actively\nstabilized, however, we believe that active stabilization of the\ninterferometer should be employed in practical applications.\nIn remote preparation of mixed states, the time delay introduced in one arm should be as exactly same as that in another\narm. So that we can make sure that POVM measurement are\naccurately performed on both the foregoing H-polarized component and the following V-polarized component. To guarantee this, we use one quartz rod instead of two quartz rods\nto introduce the time delay on both arms (see Fig. 3), which\navoid the length disagreement between any two quartz rods\ndue to the manufacturing tolerance. Then both polarization\ncomponents can perfectly interfere simultaneously and measurement operators {M1 , M2 } can be performed precisely on\nboth components.\nTo evaluate the performance of our deterministic preparation scheme, we prepared 18 different states on Bob's photon which include four pure states along each of three random longitude of the Poincar\u00e9 sphere and six mixed states in\n\n\f5\n|L\u3009\n\n|\u221245\u00b0\u3009\n\n|V\u3009\n\n|H\u3009\n\n\u00b0\n\n|+45 \u3009\n\n|R\u3009\n\nFIG. 4: States remotely prepared in our experiment are shown in the\nPoincar\u00e9 sphere. States are supposed to lie on the (semi)circle with\nthe same color. The pure states are marked by circle and the mixed\nstates are marked by diamond.\n\nthe Poincar\u00e9 sphere (see Fig. 4). With the tomography system on Bob's side, we perform complete polarization analysis on the prepared polarization states. The results are converted to the closest physically valid density matrix using\na maximum likelihood\n[28]. We use the fidelity\nq \u221a technique\n\u221a\n2\n\u03c1B \u03c1o \u03c1B )| to evaluate the agreement\nF(\u03c1o , \u03c1B ) \u2261 |T r(\nbetween the prepared state (\u03c1o ) and the desired state (\u03c1B ) [29].\nThe mean fidelity over all 18 states with all four possible results is 0.9947 in our experiment, while F=1 means perfect\nmatch. And the fidelities of all states are above 0.99.\n\nput state (11) or (16). Once the desired entanglement transformation is realized deterministically, we just need to perform appropriate projection measurement on Alice's photon\nand the remote preparation is accomplished deterministically,\nas shown in our experiment.\nAlthough we discuss the qubits encoded in the polarization\nof photons in our scheme, the methods can be generalized to\nother situations. While photons are ideal carriers in transfer of qubits, the matter carrier (e.g., ions, atoms, quantum\ndots, or superconducting circuits) are especially suitable for\nstorage and processing of qubits. The operations on Alice's\nphoton can be utilized to remote control other matter systems\nprovided that the matter system is maximally entangled with\nAlice's photon [13], which is valuable for future applications\nsuch as quantum repeater and quantum networks.\nWe experimentally demonstrate the scheme by remotely\npreparing 12 pure states and 6 mixed states. The fidelities between the desired and achieved states are all higher than 0.99\nand have an average of 0.9947.\nIn conclusion, we propose a deterministic remote state\npreparation scheme for photon polarization qubit states, where\nentanglement, local operations and classical communication\nare used. An arbitrary qubit state can be prepared deterministically at a remote location by consuming one maximally\nentangled state and two classical bits. The fidelities between\nthe desired and prepared states are all higher than 0.99 and\nhave an average of 0.9947, which indicate the high reliability of our protocol. Moreover, the experiment arrangement is\nmore compact than before with only one interferometer used,\nwhich makes it more feasible and executable in further practical applications of quantum information science.\n\nAcknowledgments\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn our experiment, POVM are employed to achieve deterministic remote preparation of arbitrary photon polarization\nstates.
