INTRODUCTION\n\nThe behavior of cold dark matter (CDM) on galaxy\nscales has been discussed extensively in the literature, with particular attention given to constraints\nfrom rotation curves of low surface brightness (LSB)\ngalaxies.\nNumerical simulations of CDM predict\ncuspy halos with a density distribution showing\na \u03c1 \u223c r\u2212\u03b1 (\u03b1 & 1) behavior, regardless of mass\n(e.g., Cole & Lacey 1996; Navarro, Frenk, & White\n1996, 1997; Avila-Reese, Firmani, & Hernandez 1998;\nKlypin et al. 2001; Diemand et al. 2005).\nHowever,\nnumerous studies of the rotation curves of LSB and\ndwarf galaxies have found the data to be inconsistent\nwith a cuspy halo, and instead to be more consistent with a halo having a nearly constant density\ncore: \u03c1 \u223c r\u2212\u03b1 (\u03b1 \u2248 0) (e.g., Flores & Primack\n1994;\nde Blok, McGaugh, & van der Hulst\n1996;\nMcGaugh, Rubin, & de Blok 2001; Marchesini et al.\n2002; de Blok, Bosma, & McGaugh 2003; Gentile et al.\n2004, 2005; Simon et al. 2005; Kuzio de Naray et al.\n2006; Spano et al. 2007). This interpretation of the\nobservations has been met with skepticism, though,\nas cored halos lack theoretical and cosmological motiElectronic address: kuzio@uci.edu\nElectronic address: ssm@astro.umd.edu\nElectronic address: edeblok@circinus.ast.uct.ac.za\n1 NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow\n2 Visiting Astronomer, Kitt Peak National Observatory, National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by\nthe Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.\n(AURA) under cooperative agreement with the National Science\nFoundation.\n\nvation. Systematic effects in the data (most notably\nbeam smearing, slit misplacement, and noncircular\nmotions) have also been used to argue against the\npresence of cored halos (e.g., van den Bosch et al. 2000;\nSwaters et al. 2003a; Simon et al. 2003; Rhee et al.\n2004), although some authors find the magnitude of\nthese effects to be insufficient for masking the presence\nof a cusp (de Blok et al. 2003).\nTo address these concerns, the most recent observations have been made using integral field spectrographs (e.g., Chemin et al. 2004; Gentile et al. 2004,\n2005; Kuzio de Naray et al. 2006; Simon et al. 2005;\nSwaters et al. 2003b). By their nature, these highresolution two-dimensional velocity fields eliminate concerns about long-slit placement, and highlight the presence of noncircular motions. They also typically probe\nin detail the innermost regions of the galaxies where the\ncusp-core conflict is most severe. Even with these improved observations, the data remain more consistent\nwith cored halos and tend to have concentrations too\nlow for \u039bCDM (Kuzio de Naray et al. 2006; Gentile et\nal. 2007; but see Swaters et al. 2003b).\nIn a previous paper (Kuzio de Naray et al. 2006, hereafter K06) , we presented high-resolution optical velocity fields and derived rotation curves for 11 LSB galaxies, along with pseudoisothermal (core) and NFW (cusp)\nhalo fits in the limit of no baryons. LSB galaxies are\nthought to be dark matter-dominated down to small radii\n(de Blok & McGaugh 1996, 1997; Boriello & Salucci\n2001; but see Fuchs 2003) with the light simply providing a tracer for the dark matter, so neglecting the\nbaryons is not entirely unreasonable. The stellar mass\n\n\f2\n\nKuzio de Naray et al.\n\ncontribution in these systems is low, which reduces errors involving the uncertainty in the stellar mass-to-light\nratio, \u03a5\u2217 , and in turn, the isolation of the dark matter\ncomponent. While halo fits are often made under the\nassumption that all observed rotation is due to the dark\nmatter, it is not strictly true. In this paper, we present\nhalo fits for four assumptions about \u03a5\u2217 for the galaxies\nin K06 with available photometry. We also present observed DensePak velocity fields, rotation curves and halo\nfits for six new galaxies, along with additional DensePak\nobservations, updated rotation curves and halo fits for\nthree galaxies in K06.\nIn \u00a7 2 we describe our sample of galaxies and the\nDensePak observations; the data reduction is discussed\nin \u00a7 3. The observed velocity fields and derived rotation\ncurves are presented in \u00a7 4 and the zero disk halo fits\nare presented in \u00a7 5. Mass models for the galaxies with\nphotometry are presented in \u00a7 6 and \u00a7 7. A discussion of\nthe mass model results is given in \u00a7 8. Our conclusions\nare stated in \u00a7 9.\n\nbefore and after each pointing. We used the 860 line\nmm\u22121 grating in second order, centered near H\u03b1, giving\na 58 km s\u22121 velocity resolution. The DensePak fibers\nare 3\u2032\u2032 , however, we achieved \u223c2\u2032\u2032 resolution by shifting\nthe DensePak array by small amounts so that the spaces\nbetween the fibers were observed. The distances to the\ngalaxies in the sample are such that a 3\u2032\u2032 fiber provides\nsubkiloparsec resolution.\n3. DATA REDUCTION\n\nDuring the nights of 2006 March 28-29, April 6-8, August 28-30 and September 25-27 we observed 17 LSB\ngalaxies using the DensePak Integrated Field Unit (IFU)\non the 3.5 m WIYN3 telescope at the Kitt Peak National\nObservatory (KPNO). UGC 4325, DDO 64, and F583-1\nwere observed during March and April. These observations augment previous DensePak observations published\nin K06. The 14 targets that were observed in August\nand September were selected primarily from the Nearby\nGalaxies Catalogue (Tully 1988). Selection criteria for\nthese galaxies included positions satisfying 18h . \u03b1 .\n08h and 10\u25e6 . \u03b4 . 50\u25e6 , inclinations between 30\u25e6 and\n85\u25e6 , heliocentric velocities . 3000 km s\u22121 , and an estimated Vf lat (approximated by Vf lat \u223c 0.5W20 (sin i)\u22121 )\nbetween roughly 50 km s\u22121 and 100 km s\u22121 . Additionally, we selected those galaxies which appear to have diffuse H\u03b1 emission and lack indicators of significant noncircular motions (e.g., strong bars or gross asymmetries).\nWe also targeted galaxies with previous long-slit rotation\ncurves or H\u03b1 imaging.\nBecause of inclement weather and telescope scheduling,\nwe did not have H\u03b1 imaging or long-slit rotation curves\nfor most of the galaxies in the sample prior to making\nthe DensePak observations. Without these data, there\nis no way of knowing how much H\u03b1 emission will be\ndetected by the IFU until the observations are actually\nmade. Thus, our observed sample of galaxies is signallimited; the IFU fibers detected sufficient H\u03b1 emission to\ncreate a useable velocity field in just under 50% of our\ntarget galaxies.\nThe observing setup and procedure were identical to\nthat used in K06. The IFU orientation on the sky and\nthe total number of pointings per galaxy were tailored to\neach galaxy so that the critical central regions were covered by the DensePak fibers. Each exposure was 1800 s,\nand two exposures were taken at each pointing. To provide wavelength calibration, a CuAr lamp was observed\n\nThe data were reduced following the procedure described in K06. Briefly, the observations were reduced\nin IRAF4 using the HYDRA package. Night-sky emission\nlines (Osterbrock et al. 1996) were used for wavelength\ncalibration, and velocities were measured by fitting Gaussians to both the sky lines and the four galactic emission lines of interest: H\u03b1, [N ii]\u03bb6584, [S ii]\u03bb6717 and\n[S ii]\u03bb6731. The average error on individual emissionline velocities due to centroiding accuracies was roughly\n1.5 km s\u22121 . The velocity assigned to each fiber was the\narithmetic mean of the measured emission-line velocities\nin the fiber. The error on the fiber velocity was the maximum difference between the measured velocities and the\nmean. Many of these errors were less than 5 km s\u22121 ,\nalthough a few were as high as \u223c20 km s\u22121 . If only H\u03b1\nwas observed in a fiber, the observed H\u03b1 velocity was\ntaken as the fiber velocity. Without other lines to determine the maximum difference, we adopt 10 km s\u22121 as\na conservative error estimate based on experience with\nlong-slit data (e.g. McGaugh et al. 2001).\nUsing the input shifts at the telescope, individual\nDensePak pointings were combined to construct the observed velocity field. An H\u03b1 flux image of the galaxy\nconstructed from the DensePak observations was compared to an actual H\u03b1 image of the galaxy obtained at\nthe KPNO 2 m telescope to confirm the accuracy of the\noffsets. The fiber maps were registered to the galaxy image by the correspondence of flux maxima through the\nfibers to observed features like individual Hii regions. We\nfind the accuracy of the fiber positions (\u223c0\u2032\u2032 .6) to be consistent with our results in K06. Both large (1\u2032\u2032 \u22122\u2032\u2032 ) and\nsmall (\u223c0\u2032\u2032 .7) shifts can be made confidently.\nRotation curves were derived from the observed velocity fields using the tilted-ring fitting program ROTCUR\n(Begeman 1989) following the procedure outlined in K06.\nTo construct a rotation curve, ROTCUR requires the systemic velocity, inclination, kinematic center, and position\nangle of the galaxy in addition to the observed fiber velocities. For a more complete description of ROTCUR as\napplied here, the reader is referred to K06.\nBecause the DensePak data cover the centers of\nthe galaxies and probe the regime of solid-body rotation, neither the galaxy center nor the inclination\ncould be determined from the observations. The velocity field centers were therefore fixed to the optical centers of the galaxies, as determined by the centroid of ellipses fit in the surface photometry, and\nthe inclination was fixed to published values (Tully\n1988; de Blok & McGaugh 1996; McGaugh et al. 2001;\n\n3 Based on observations obtained at the WIYN Observatory.\nThe WIYN Observatory is a joint facility of the University of\nWisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, Yale University, and the\nNational Optical Astronomy Observatory.\n\n4 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for\nResearch in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under agreement with the\nNational Science Foundation.\n\n2.

We used ROTCUR to determine the position angle of the major axis, using published long-slit values as\nthe initial guess. If the position angle could not be wellconstrained by ROTCUR, then it was fixed to the longslit value. The position angles of UGC 4325, DDO 64,\nand F583-1 were not well-constrained by ROTCUR, and\nremained fixed at the values used in K06. The position angle of the major axis was well-constrained by\nROTCUR for all of the galaxies in the new sample except\nfor UGC 128. In the case of UGC 128, the position angle was set to the position angle of the Hi velocity field\nof van der Hulst et al. (1993). For reasons described in\nK06, we did not impose a minimum error on the rotation\ncurve points. However, we added in quadrature to the\nerror bars on the final ROTCUR rotation curve the velocity error from Gaussian centroiding accuracy, typically\n\u223c1.5 km s\u22121 , corrected for inclination. We have also not\ncorrected the rotation velocities for asymmetric drift, as\nthe corrections are typically only \u223c2 km s\u22121 (see also\nde Blok & Bosma 2002).\n4. OBSERVED VELOCITY FIELDS AND DERIVED\nROTATION CURVES\n\nIn this section, we present the DensePak fiber positions, observed velocity fields, and rotation curves in Figures 1-3. A description of each galaxy is given, and the\nproperties of the galaxies for which a rotation curve was\nderived are listed in Table 1.\n4.1. Extended Observations of Previously Observed\n\nGalaxies\nAdditional DensePak observations were made of three\ngalaxies published in K06. In this section, we describe\nthe positions of the new DensePak pointings, present\nthe augmented velocity fields, and discuss the resulting\nchanges in the rotation curves.\n\nUGC 4325 \u2212 There were four new DensePak pointings roughly through the galaxy center from SE to NW.\nAll eight pointings are shown on the H\u03b1 image (Figure 1)\nof the galaxy. The fiber velocities were the average of the\nH\u03b1 and [S ii]\u03bb6717 lines. The position angle of the major axis remained fixed at the average of the position angles of previous long-slit observations (de Blok & Bosma\n2002; Swaters et al. 2003a). With the addition of the\nnew DensePak pointings, the DensePak rotation curve\nextends to \u223c 60\u2032\u2032 and remains in excellent agreement\nwith the long-slit H\u03b1 rotation curve of de Blok & Bosma\n(2002).\nDDO 64 \u2212 There were two new DensePak pointings\nalong the SE end of DDO 64. All five pointings are shown\non the H\u03b1 image (Figure 1) of the galaxy. The fiber velocities were the average of the H\u03b1 and [S ii]\u03bb6717 lines.\nThe position angle remained fixed at the value determined in de Blok & Bosma (2002). With the addition of\nthe new DensePak pointings and an H\u03b1 image, the positions of the DensePak fibers on the galaxy have been\nupdated and the center of the velocity field has moved\n13\u2032\u2032 E and 2\u2032\u2032 .5 S. The new DensePak rotation curve is\nnow consistent with the long-slit H\u03b1 rotation curve of\nde Blok & Bosma (2002) in the inner 20\u2032\u2032 . Beyond 20\u2032\u2032 ,\nthe DensePak rotation curve shows a more linear rise\nwith less scatter than its previous version.\nF583-1 \u2212 There were two new DensePak pointings,\none to the north and one to the east, on this galaxy. All\nthree pointings are shown on the R-band image (Figure\n1) of the galaxy from de Blok et al. (1996). The fiber\nvelocities were the average of the H\u03b1, [S ii]\u03bb6717, and\n[S ii]\u03bb6731 lines. The receding side of the galaxy and\nmore of the minor axis are now covered with the additional pointings. The position angle remained fixed\nat the value listed in McGaugh et al. (2001). The new\nDensePak rotation curve shows less scatter than the\ncurve derived from a single DensePak pointing, and it displays a higher level of consistency with the long-slit H\u03b1\n\n\f4\n\nKuzio de Naray et al.\n\nrotation curve of de Blok, McGaugh, & Rubin (2001).\n4.2. New Observations\n\nOf the 14 galaxies observed, there were eight galaxies\nfor which meaningful velocity fields could not be constructed.5 The H\u03b1 emission in these galaxies was too\nfaint to be detected and/or not spread out enough across\nthe fiber array. Velocity fields and rotation curves were\nderived for the remaining six galaxies in the sample, and\neach is described below.\nNGC 7137 \u2212 There were three DensePak pointings\nfor this galaxy. The pointings are shown on the H\u03b1 image (Figure 2) of the galaxy. Spiral arms are clearly\nvisible in this galaxy. The fiber velocities were the average of the H\u03b1, [N ii]\u03bb6584, [S ii]\u03bb6717, and [S ii]\u03bb6731\nlines. H\u03b1 emission was abundant and the majority of\nfibers detected emission. The inclination was fixed to\nthe value in Tully (1988). The position angle of the major axis was well-constrained by ROTCUR. The rotation\ncurve rises steeply out to roughly 10\u2032\u2032 then dips slightly\nbefore rising again.\nUGC 11820 \u2212 This galaxy is both large and diffuse\non the sky. There is a central concentration of H\u03b1 emission, which is perhaps a bar, that runs roughly NE-SW\nand also two large, diffuse arms that extend from the end\nof the bar. There were three DensePak pointings along\nthe central feature. The pointings are shown on the H\u03b1\nimage (Figure 2) of the galaxy. The fiber velocities were\nthe average of the H\u03b1, [S ii]\u03bb6717, and [S ii]\u03bb6731 lines.\nThe H\u03b1 emission was sparse and only roughly half of the\nfibers detected emission. The inclination was fixed to\nthe value listed in McGaugh et al. (2001). The position\nangle of the major axis was well-constrained by ROTCUR.\nUGC 128 \u2212 There were three DensePak pointings\nacross this galaxy. The pointings are shown on the\nH\u03b1 image (Figure 2) of the galaxy. The fiber velocities\nwere the average of the H\u03b1, [N ii]\u03bb6584, and [S ii]\u03bb6717\nlines. The H\u03b1 emission in this galaxy was sparse, but the\nemission that was present was scattered across the three\nDensePak pointings such that both the approaching and\nreceding sides of the velocity field were mapped. The position angle was fixed to the position angle of the Hi velocity field of van der Hulst et al. (1993) and the inclination was fixed to the value listed in de Blok & McGaugh\n(1996). The DensePak rotation curve is plotted with the\nHi rotation curve of Verheijen & de Blok (1999). The\nDensePak rotation curve is largely consistent with if not\nslightly steeper than the Hi curve and does not go out\nfar enough to show a clear turn-over.\nUGC 191 \u2212 There were two DensePak pointings for\nthis galaxy and they are shown on the H\u03b1 image (Figure 3). The fiber velocities were the average of the H\u03b1,\n[S ii]\u03bb6717, and [S ii]\u03bb6731 lines. There is ample H\u03b1\nemission in the galaxy and almost every fiber had a detection. The inclination was fixed to the value in Tully\n(1988). The position angle of the major axis was wellconstrained by ROTCUR. The rotation curve rises linearly\nand has no clear turn-over.\nUGC 1551 \u2212 There were three DensePak pointings\nfor this galaxy. The pointings are shown on the H\u03b1 image\n(Figure 3) of the galaxy. The fiber velocities were the av5 F469-2, UGC 2034, UGC 2053, UGC 11944, UGC 12048/NGC\n7292, UGC 12082, UGC 12212, and UGC 12632.\n\nerage of the H\u03b1, [N ii]\u03bb6584, [S ii]\u03bb6717, and [S ii]\u03bb6731\nlines. H\u03b1 emission was detected in nearly all of the fibers.\nThe inclination was fixed to the value in Tully (1988).\nThe position angle of the major axis was well-constrained\nby ROTCUR. There is a twist in the velocity field that is\nsuggestive of the presence of a bar. Noncircular motions\nare probably important inside of 15\u2032\u2032 where the rotation\ncurve is mostly flat. Beyond 15\u2032\u2032 , there is a linear rise in\nthe rotation curve.\nNGC 959 \u2212 There were three DensePak pointings\nacross the length of this galaxy. The pointings are\nshown on the H\u03b1 image (Figure 3) of the galaxy. The\nfiber velocities were the average of the H\u03b1, [N ii]\u03bb6584,\n[S ii]\u03bb6717, and [S ii]\u03bb6731 lines. H\u03b1 emission was abundant and the majority of fibers detected emission. The\ninclination was fixed to the value listed in James et al.\n(2004). The position angle of the major axis was\nwell-constrained by ROTCUR. The rotation curve is wellbehaved with a steady rise and a turnover to Vf lat \u223c 80\nkm s\u22121 .\n5. ZERO DISK HALO FITS\n\nIn this section, we present the pseudoisothermal and\nNFW halo fits to the DensePak rotation curves in the\nzero disk case. By ignoring the velocity contribution from\nthe baryons and attributing all rotation to dark matter,\nwe are able to put an upper limit on the slope and/or concentration of the halo density profile. For those galaxies\nwith photometry, halo fits for three assumptions about\nthe stellar mass-to-light ratio are presented in \u00a7 6.\n5.1. Halo Models\nThe cuspy NFW halo and the cored pseudoisothermal\nhalo are two of the most well-known competing descriptions of dark matter halos. We provide a brief description\nof each below.\n5.1.1. NFW Profile\n\nNumerical simulations show that the density of CDM\nhalos rises steeply toward the halo center. The exact\nvalue of the inner slope of the CDM halo varies slightly\ndepending on the simulation (e.g. Navarro et al. 1996,\n1997; Moore et al. 1999; Reed et al. 2003; Navarro et al.\n2004; Diemand et al. 2005). From an observational perspective, there is very little to distinguish the various\nflavors of cuspy CDM halos, and we choose to fit the\ndata with the NFW halo.\nThe NFW mass-density distribution is described as\n\u03c1i\n,\n(1)\n\u03c1N F W (R) =\n(R/Rs )(1 + R/Rs )2\nin which \u03c1i is related to the density of the universe at the\ntime of halo collapse, and Rs is the characteristic radius\nof the halo. The NFW rotation curve is given by\ns\nln(1 + cx) \u2212 cx/(1 + cx)\nV (R) = V200\n,\n(2)\nx[ln(1 + c) \u2212 c/(1 + c)]\nwith x = R/R200 . The rotation curve is parameterized\nby a radius R200 and a concentration parameter c =\nR200 /Rs , both of which are directly related to Rs and\n\u03c1i . Here R200 is the radius at which the density contrast\nexceeds 200, roughly the virial radius; V200 is the circular\n\n\fMass Models of LSB Galaxies\n\n5\n\nFig. 1.- Additional observations of UGC 4325, DDO 64, and F583-1.

Because the\nNFW profile has a shallower slope than other cuspy halo\nmodels, it provides a lower limit on the slope of cuspy\ndensity profiles and, as such, gives the cuspy halo the\nbest possible chance to fit the data.\n5.1.2. Pseudoisothermal Halo\n\nThe pseudoisothermal halo describes a dark matter\nhalo that has a core of roughly constant density. By construction, it produces flat rotation curves at large radii.\nThe density profile of the pseudoisothermal halo is\n\u03c1iso (R) = \u03c10 [1 + (R/RC )2 ]\u22121 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03c10 being the central density of the halo and RC\nrepresenting the core radius of the halo.

Halo Fits to Previously Observed Galaxies\n\nWe find the best-fit zero disk case isothermal and NFW\nhalos to the new DensePak rotation curves of UGC 4325,\n\n\f6\n\nKuzio de Naray et al.\n\nFig. 2.- Results for NGC 7137, UGC 11820, & UGC 128.

The DensePak rotation curve of UGC 128 is\nplotted with the Hi rotation curve of Verheijen & de Blok (1999) (stars). [See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version of\nthis figure.]\n\nDDO 64, and F583-1. When available, the DensePak\nrotation curves have been supplemented with previous\nsmoothed long-slit H\u03b1 and Hi rotation curves. We use\nthe entire long-slit rotation curve, and include only those\nHi points that extend beyond the radial range of both the\nDensePak and long-slit data. Uncertainties from possible\nresolution effects are avoided by using only the outer Hi\npoints.\nFor these three galaxies, we also fit an NFW halo called\nNFWconstrained (hereafter NFWconstr ), as described in\ndetail in K06. This halo fit is motivated by NFW fits that\nhave parameters which are unrealistic or inconsistent\nwith \u039bCDM. Briefly, the constrained halo was required\nto match the velocities at the outer radii of each galaxy\nwhile constraining the concentration to agree with cosmology. The concentrations were calculated using Equation (7) of de Blok et al. (2003), which gives the concentration as a function of of V200 (Navarro et al. 1997), and\nthen adjusted to the cosmology of Tegmark et al. (2004)\nby subtracting 0.011 dex (McGaugh, Barker, & de Blok\n2003).\nThe halo fits are plotted over the data in Figure 4, and\n\nthe halo parameters are listed in Tables 2 and 3. For\ncomparison, the numbers mentioned in the text below\nare the fits from K06, unless specifically noted otherwise.\nUGC 4325 \u2212 The isothermal fit to UGC 4325 improves slightly with the addition of the four new\nDensePak pointings (Rc = 3.3 \u00b1 0.2; \u03c10 = 91 \u00b1 4; \u03c72\n= 3.8). An unconstrained NFW halo still could not be\nfitted to the data, and the poor quality of the NFWconstr\nfit remains virtually unimproved (c = 6.9; V200 = 249;\n\u03c72 = 40). This galaxy remains best-described by the\nisothermal halo.\nDDO 64 \u2212 The two new DensePak pointings on DDO\n64 help to improve the quality of both the isothermal and\nNFWconstr fits. The values of the isothermal halo parameters remain within the errors of the original values, but\nthe value of \u03c72r decreases (Rc = 4.4 \u00b1 0.9; \u03c10 = 38 \u00b1 3;\n\u03c72 = 5.5). While no unconstrained NFW halo fit could\nbe made, the quality of the NFWconstr halo significantly\nimproves (c = 9.2; V200 = 62; \u03c72 = 20). This does not\nmean, however, that the NFW halo is a good fit to the\ndata. The NFWconstr halo continues to overshoot the\ndata at radii interior to where it was forced to match the\n\n\fMass Models of LSB Galaxies\n\n7\n\nFig. 3.- Results for UGC 191, UGC 1551, & NGC 959.

[See the electronic edition of the Journal for\na color version of this figure.]\n\ndata. While it passes through the large errorbars on the\ninner rotation curve points, significant noncircular motions would need to be important all the way out to \u223c1\nkpc in order to boost the observed velocities up to the\nexpected NFW velocities.\nF583-1 \u2212 The isothermal and NFW fits are significantly better constrained by the addition of the two new\nDensePak pointings. F583-1 remains best-described by\nthe isothermal halo. The values of the halo parameters\nremain within the errors of the previous values, but the\nvalue of \u03c72r falls from 5.4 to 0.5 (Rc = 2.7 \u00b1 0.1; \u03c10 = 35\n\u00b1 2). The new values of the isothermal halo parameters\nare almost indistinguishable from the values determined\nby de Blok et al. (2001): Rc = 2.44 \u00b1 0.06, \u03c10 = 33.0 \u00b1\n1.1. The values of the parameters of the unconstrained\nNFW fit are also mostly unchanged, and \u03c72r decreases to\n1.7 from 8.7 (c = 4.7 \u00b1 0.7; V200 = 133 \u00b1 21). The value\nof the concentration, c = 4.5, is still too low to be consistent with \u039bCDM. The value of \u03c72r also drops for the\nNFWconstr fit (\u03c72 = 11 \u2192 6.5), but the NFW velocities\ncontinue to over-predict the observed velocities interior\nto where they were forced to match the data.\n\n5.3. Halo Fits to New Observations\n\nWe find the best-fit zero disk case isothermal and\nNFW halos to the DensePak rotation curves of NGC\n7137, UGC 11820, UGC 128, UGC 191, UGC 1551, and\nNGC 959. In the case of UGC 128, we combine the\nDensePak rotation curve with the Hi rotation curve of\nVerheijen & de Blok (1999), using only those Hi points\nbeyond the radial range of the DensePak data. We do\nnot make an NFWconstr fit to these six galaxies, as the\nradial range of the data does not extend beyond the rising part of the rotation curve. In Figure 4 we plot the\nhalo fits over the data, and list the halo parameters in\nTables 2 and 3.\nNGC 7137 \u2212 The isothermal halo is a slightly better\nfit to NGC 7137 than the NFW halo, but the difference\nis not particularly significant. There are \"bumps and\nwiggles\" in the rotation curve that simple, smooth halo\nmodels cannot fit. The value of the concentration, c =\n15, for the NFW fit is on the high side of values expected\nin a \u039bCDM cosmology.\nUGC 11820 \u2212 UGC 11820 is fit relatively well by the\nisothermal halo; no NFW halo could be fit to the rotation\n\n\f8\n\nKuzio de Naray et al.\n\nFig. 4.- Halo fits to the DensePak rotation curves. The red solid line is the best-fit isothermal halo, the green short-dashed line is the\nbest-fit unconstrained NFW halo, and the black long-dashed line is the best-fit NFWconstr halo. NFWconstr fits were only made to UGC\n4325, DDO 64, and F583-1. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version of this figure.]\n\ncurve.\nUGC 128 \u2212 UGC 128 is more consistent with the\nisothermal halo than the NFW halo, though the value\nof \u03c72r is high for both fits and both halo models overestimate the rotation velocities at small radii. The bestfitting concentration, c = 8.9, is reasonable for a galaxy of\nthis size in a \u039bCDM cosmology. The best-fitting isothermal halo parameters for the combined DensePak+Hi\nrotation curve are Rc = 2.3\u00b10.1 and \u03c10 = 66\u00b10.6.\nde Blok & McGaugh (1996) also fit an isothermal halo\nto the van der Hulst et al. (1993) Hi rotation curve and\nfind Rc = 4.0 and \u03c10 = 21.7. The differences in the halo\nparameters reflect the inclusion of the slightly steeper\nDensePak rotation curve.\nUGC 191 \u2212 We exclude the innermost point of the\nUGC 191 rotation curve due to its unrealistically small\nformal error bar and the steep jump in velocity between\nit and the next rotation curve point. Excluding this point\nfrom the halo fits does not significantly alter the values of\nthe halo parameters, but does improve the values of the\nreduced \u03c72 . No NFW fit could be made to the DensePak\n\nrotation curve. The data were fit with an isothermal\nhalo, albeit with a large \u03c72r . The UGC 191 DensePak\nrotation curve is linearly rising and shows no turn-over\nover in the radial range covered by the DensePak data.\nTo be useful for distinguishing between halo models, data\npoints at larger radii are needed to better constrain the\nhalo fits.\nUGC 1551 \u2212 We exclude the first five points of the\nUGC 1551 rotation curve because the twist in the velocity field suggests that a bar may be present in the\ngalaxy. An NFW fit could not be made to the data; an\nisothermal fit was made, but was not well-constrained.\nLike UGC 191, data at larger radii are necessary for obtaining useful constraints on the halo models.\nNGC 959 \u2212 NGC 959 is well described by the isothermal halo and is a slightly better fit than the NFW halo.\nThe value of the concentration, c = 23, of the best fit\nNFW halo is on the high side of expected values for\ngalaxies in a \u039bCDM cosmology.\n\n\fMass Models of LSB Galaxies\n\n9\n\nTABLE 2\nIsothermal Halo Parameters\n\nGalaxy\n\nRc\n\nUGC 4325\nF563-V2\nF563-1\nDDO 64\nF568-3\nUGC 5750\nNGC 4395\nF583-4\nF583-1\nNGC 7137\nUGC 11820\nUGC 128\nUGC 191\nUGC 1551\nNGC 959\n\n4.1\u00b10.3\n1.5\u00b10.1\n2.1\u00b10.1\n3.3\u00b10.5\n3.8\u00b10.2\n5.7\u00b10.4\n0.7\u00b10.1\n1.3\u00b10.1\n2.5\u00b10.1\n0.6\u00b10.1\n1.1\u00b10.1\n2.3\u00b10.1\n1.7\u00b10.1\n1.3\u00b10.2\n0.4\u00b10.1\n\nGalaxy\n\nRc\n\nUGC 4325a\nF563-V2\nF563-1b\n\n6.2\u00b13.3\n1.4\u00b10.2\n2.1\u00b10.2\n***\n5.9\u00b111.1\n4.7\u00b10.8\n7.5\u00b11.6\n0.50\u00b10.04\n1.2\u00b10.2\n2.5\u00b10.2\n***\n\nDDO 64a\nF568-3\nUGC 5750\nNGC 4395a\nF583-4a\nF583-1b\n\nZERO DISK\n\u03c10\n88\u00b13\n119\u00b16\n67\u00b12\n43\u00b13\n27\u00b11\n7.1\u00b10.3\n258\u00b19\n67\u00b12\n30\u00b12\n274\u00b117\n274\u00b121\n66\u00b10.6\n138\u00b110\n57\u00b15\n1117\u00b129\n\n\u03c72r\n\n\u03a5\u2217\n\nRc\n\n3.2\n0.71\n0.43\n3.2\n1.2\n0.83\n2.9\n0.67\n0.50\n3.1\n2.9\n8.5\n5.8\n5.5\n1.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n4.6\u00b11.5\n1.4\u00b10.2\n2.0\u00b10.2\n4.1\u00b13.8\n4.0\u00b10.5\n6.5\u00b11.1\n0.57\u00b10.05\n1.2\u00b10.2\n2.4\u00b10.2\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\n\u03a5\u2217\n\nRc\n\n1.14\n0.88\n1.36\n***\n1.24\n1.32\n1.24\n1.40\n1.06\n1.24\n***\n\n2.5\n4.7\u00b15.9\n4.2\u00b11.2\n12.5\u00b19.0\n1.5\n6.1\u00b11.8\n9.8\u00b13.2\n19\n8\n3.6\u00b10.5\n6.9\u00b11.7\n\nPOPSYNTH\n\u03c10\n\u03c72r\n66\u00b15\n102\u00b120\n54\u00b110\n***\n32\u00b15\n16\u00b13\n4.1\u00b10.5\n355\u00b150\n63\u00b116\n27\u00b13\n***\n\n3.2\n0.75\n0.50\n***\n3.5\n1.8\n0.95\n2.8\n0.62\n0.60\n***\n\nMINIMAL DISK\n\u03c10\n\u03c72r\n77\u00b15\n114\u00b120\n61\u00b110\n37\u00b16\n22\u00b13\n5.2\u00b10.6\n318\u00b142\n66\u00b116\n30\u00b13\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\n3.1\n0.68\n0.48\n3.3\n1.5\n0.84\n2.7\n0.62\n0.59\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\nMAXIMUM DISK\n\u03c10\n\u03c72r\n45\n7.1\u00b18.8\n13\u00b16\n2.7\u00b11.6\n24\n10\u00b13\n2.6\u00b10.5\n0.32\n1.4\n14\u00b12\n5.2\u00b10.9\n\n11\n1.4\n0.83\n1.3\n2.2\n2.5\n1.3\n4.1\n1.2\n0.83\n2.0\n\n\u03a5\u2217\n0.57\n0.44\n0.68\n0.62\n0.66\n0.62\n0.70\n0.53\n0.62\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\n\u03a5\u2217\n4.5\n4.0\n6.5\n10.0\n5.0\n2.3\n2.2\n9.0\n10.0\n5.0\n10.0\n\nNote. - Rc is in kpc; \u03c10 is in 10\u22123 M\u2299 pc\u22123 .

Summary of Zero Disk Halo Fits\n\nIn \u00a7 5.2 and \u00a7 5.3 we have presented updated zero disk\nhalo fits to three galaxies from K06 and six new galaxies\nobserved with DensePak. Overall, we find the isothermal\nhalo to be a better description of seven of these galaxies\nthan the NFW halo. Two of the new galaxies do not\nhave data at large enough radii to put useful constraints\non the halo models. When NFW fits could be made,\nthe concentrations were often beyond the range of values expected for \u039bCDM. We find that the parameters of\nthe halo fits to the three previously observed galaxies do\nnot significantly change, but are better constrained by\nthe additional DensePak coverage. The DensePak rotation curves of the six new galaxies could all be fit by the\nisothermal halo, and an NFW fit could be made to only\nthree. Only one of the three NFW fits had a concentration consistent with the range expected for galaxies in a\n\u039bCDM cosmology; the other two are on the high end of\nexpected values. We also find that the quality of both\nthe isothermal and NFW halo fits is greatly improved\nwhen the radial range of the data extends into the flat\npart of the rotation curve. Of the six new galaxies, only\nNGC 959 has a DensePak rotation curve which clearly\nturns over and flattens, and it is this galaxy that has the\nisothermal and NFW fits with the lowest \u03c72r .\n6. MASS MODELS\n\nLow surface brightness galaxies are dark matterdominated down to small radii. Because of this, the velocity contribution from the baryons is often disregarded\nwhen fitting dark matter halo models to the galaxy rotation curves. This type of fit which ignores the contribution of the stars and gas, such as in \u00a7 5, is usually called\nthe minimum-disk case. While the dark matter is the\ndominant mass component of LSB galaxies at all radii,\nbaryons are still important. To accurately determine the\ndistribution of the dark matter, it is necessary to properly account for the stars and gas in the galaxies and\ntheir contribution to the observed rotation. The velocity component coming from the stars is determined from\nthe surface photometry scaled by the stellar mass-to-light\nratio, \u03a5\u2217 . This is a straightforward computation of the\ngravitational potential of the observed stars. However,\nthe true value of \u03a5\u2217 is difficult to determine, and as discussed below, can be assigned a value following a number\nof techniques. Similarly, the velocity component from the\ngas is determined using Hi surface density profiles. The\nconversion from observed 21 cm luminosity to atomic gas\nmass is well understood from the physics of the spin-flip\ntransition. A scaling factor, the inverse of the hydrogen mass fraction, is usually included to account for the\nhelium and metals also present in the galaxies.\nIn \u00a7 5 of this paper and in K06, we have so far ignored\nthe baryons in the halo fits to LSB galaxies observed with\nDensePak.

In this\nsection, we describe each of these dynamical components.\n6.1.1. Stars\n\nGalaxy photometry in combination with a stellar massto-light ratio, \u03a5\u2217 , is used to determine the stellar contribution to the observed galaxy rotation. It is difficult\nto determine the true value of \u03a5\u2217 of a galaxy because it\ndepends on many factors ranging from the initial mass\nfunction to the extinction. To address this uncertainty,\nwe consider four different scenarios for the value of \u03a5\u2217 .\nWe assume that \u03a5\u2217 is constant with radius.\nZero disk \u2212 In this limiting case we ignore the contribution of the stars (\u03a5\u2217 = 0) and gas and attribute all\nrotation to dark matter. This case is typically called\n'minimum disk' in the literature; we have chosen to refer\nto this case as zero disk because it aptly describes the\nomission of the baryons. The zero disk case puts an upper limit on the slope and/or concentration of the halo\ndensity profile. The results for the zero disk case were\npresented in \u00a7 5 and also K06 (where they were referred\nto as minimum-disk) and are reproduced in Tables 2 and\n\n\fMass Models of LSB Galaxies\n\n11\n\nUGC 4325 ISO\n\n0\n\nUGC 4325 NFW\n\nzero\n\nzero\n\nmin\n\nmin\n\npopsynth\n\npopsynth\n\nmax\n\nmax\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nr(kpc)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nr(kpc)\n\nFig. 5.- Isothermal and NFW halo fits for UGC 4325.

The velocity contribution from both the stars and gas is ignored in the zero disk case. The minimal disk case\nconsiders the gas contribution and assumes a lightweight IMF for the stars. The popsynth case includes the gas contribution and uses\npopulation synthesis models to determine the stellar contribution. The maximum disk case includes the gas contribution and the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio is scaled up as far as the data will allow. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version of this figure.]\n\n3 for completeness. Two galaxies from K06, UGC 1281\nand UGC 477, are excluded from mass models beyond\nzero disk because of their high inclinations and possible\nassociated line-of-sight integration effects. Photometry\nis unavailable for the six new galaxies presented in \u00a7 5;\nmass models beyond zero disk will not be presented.\nMinimal disk \u2212 Though commonly employed, the\nzero disk case is unphysical. We next consider a more\nrealistic minimal contribution of the stars and the gas.\nThe \u03a5\u2217 is determined from population synthesis models\n(see below) and then scaled by 0.5 (see McGaugh 2005)\nto simulate a lightweight IMF.\nPopsynth\u2212 Here \u03a5\u2217 is determined using the population synthesis models of Bell et al. (2003). Specifically,\nwe use the relation between \u03a5\u2217 and color as defined in\n\ntheir Table 7. For a scaled Salpeter IMF, (B\u2013R) and\n(B \u2212V ) colors are related to \u03a5\u2217 . This is our best estimate of the baryonic mass from the perspective of stellar\npopulations. The popsynth model also includes the gas\ncontribution. Colors and corresponding \u03a5\u2217 are listed in\nTable 4.\nMaximum disk \u2212 We also consider the case where\nthe \u03a5\u2217 is scaled up as far as the data will allow. In high\nsurface brightness galaxies, this approach usually fits the\ninner rotation curve well. In LSB galaxies, the shape of\nthe stellar rotation curve is often not well-matched to the\nobserved rotation curve. We have chosen a \u03a5\u2217 that allows the stellar rotation curve to match the inner rotation\ncurve points as well as possible, sometimes overshooting\nthe innermost point in order to hit the next few.

F583-4) are\nsubstantially higher.\nTo model the stellar disk we have used the R-band photometry presented in de Blok et al. (1995), Stil (1999),\nSwaters (1999), and Swaters et al. (2002). The GIPSY\ntask ROTMOD was used to determine the rotation of\nthe disk assuming a vertical sech2 distribution with\na scale height z 0 =h/6 (van der Kruit & Searle 1981).\nThe stellar rotation curve computed from the photometry was resampled at the same radii as the combined\nDensePak+long-slit+Hi rotation curves.\nEach estimator of \u03a5\u2217 has its advantages and disadvantages. The zero disk \u03a5\u2217 is often adopted and is useful\nbecause it provides an upper limit on the dark matter.\nUnfortunately, it is an unphysical assumption. Population synthesis models best represent what we know\nabout stars, however, sometimes the data will allow a\n\nlarger \u03a5\u2217 . And although \u03a5\u2217MAX often seems too large\nwith respect to \u03a5\u2217P OP , disk features like bars and spiral arms require a large disk mass (McGaugh & de Blok\n1998; Fuchs 2003) and support high \u03a5\u2217MAX .\n6.1.2. Gas\n\nThe gas present in galaxies also contributes to the observed galaxy rotation. Hi is the dominant gas component, but to include helium and metals, the Hi data\nwere scaled by a factor of 1.4. Substantial amounts of\nmolecular gas are not obviously present in LSB galaxies\n(de Blok & van der Hulst 1998; Schombert et al. 1990).\nThe total mass of H2 is almost certainly much less than\nthat of Hi (Mihos, Spaans, & McGaugh 1999). Moreover, in brighter galaxies H2 is known to trace the stars\n(Regan et al. 2001), so at most represents a slight tweak\nto \u03a5\u2217 .

Dark Matter Halo\n\nIn LSB galaxies there is usually a considerable amount\nof observed rotation unaccounted for after subtracting\noff the velocity of the stellar and gas disks, even in the\nmaximum disk case. The remaining rotation is usually\nattributed to dark matter. While there have been a number of dark matter models proposed in the literature, we\nfit two of the most prominent competing profiles: the\npseudo-isothermal halo and the NFW profile. Both halo\n\nprofiles are described in \u00a7 5.1.\n7. MASS MODEL RESULTS FOR INDIVIDUAL GALAXIES\n\nIn this section, we present the isothermal and NFW\nhalo fits for the four scenarios of \u03a5\u2217 . The halo parameters are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Figures 5-13 plot the\nhalo fits over the data.\nAs \u03a5\u2217 increases and the baryons become responsible\nfor more of the observed velocity, less room is available\nfor dark matter and the NFW halo becomes increasingly\ndifficult to fit to the data. The best-fit concentrations\ndrop to very small, and sometimes negative, values. In\nthese cases, we forced an NFW fit with c = 1.0. The halo\nparameters of forced fits are italicised in the tables.\nUGC 4325 \u2212 UGC 4325 is clearly best described by\nan isothermal halo; an NFW halo could not be fit to the\ndata for any \u03a5\u2217 scenario. With \u03a5\u2217MAX = 4.5, the stellar rotation curve is able to describe the data well out\nto a radius of \u223c 1.3 kpc, as compared to . 0.4 kpc for\n\n\f14\n\nKuzio de Naray et al.\n\nDDO 64 ISO\n\n0\n\nDDO 64 NFW\n\nzero\n\nzero\n\nmin\n\nmin\n\npopsynth\n\npopsynth\n\nmax\n\nmax\n\n1\n\n2\nr(kpc)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nr(kpc)\n\nFig. 8.- Isothermal and NFW halo fits for DDO 64. Line types are described in Figure 5. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for\na color version of this figure.]\n\n\u03a5\u2217P OP = 1.14. Because the baryons are able to explain\nso much of the data in the maximum disk case, there is\nlittle room left for a dark matter isothermal halo. When\nthis happens, the cored halo becomes very nearly hollow\nwith \u03c10 decreasing to a very small value and Rc increasing to a large number. For the maximum disk case of\nUGC 4325, we forced an isothermal halo fit by fixing Vh\nto approximately the observed velocities of the outer rotation curve and then varying Rc such that VT OT follows\nthe data. In this fit, the resulting Rc is a lower limit and\n\u03c10 is an upper limit.\nF563-V2 \u2212 As discussed in K06 for the zero disk case,\nF563-V2 has too few data points to really distinguish between halo types. This remains true for the other \u03a5\u2217 scenarios as well. The value of \u03a5\u2217 can be turned up to 4.0\nin the maximum disk case, leaving essentially no room\nfor an NFW halo; a fit was forced with c = 1.0. NFW\nhalos could be fit to the zero, minimal, and popsynth\n\ncases, however, and the values of the best-fitting concentrations, c = 7.7, 8.4, and 7.8, respectively, are comparable to values expected from simulations. Because\nof the c-V200 degeneracy that allows halos of different\n(c, V200 ) to look the same over a finite range of radius\n(de Blok et al. 2001), these three NFW fits are essentially indistinguishable. This is an example of where the\nzero disk assumption is reasonable for LSB galaxies.\nF563-1 \u2212 The isothermal halo fits the F563-1 data\nbetter than the NFW halo, though the values of the bestfitting concentrations are consistent with values expected\nin \u039bCDM. The baryons can account for the majority of\nthe observed rotation in the maximum disk case and a\nforced NFW fit was made with the concentration fixed\nat 1.0. Stellar population models set \u03a5\u2217P OP = 1.36 for\nF563-1. With this value of the \u03a5\u2217 , the stellar rotation\ncurve just grazes the innermost observed rotation curve\npoint. The \u03a5\u2217MAX can be substantially turned up such\n\n\fMass Models of LSB Galaxies\n\n15\n\nF568-3 ISO\n\n0\n\nF568-3 NFW\n\nzero\n\nzero\n\nmin\n\nmin\n\npopsynth\n\npopsynth\n\nmax\n\nmax\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nr(kpc)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nr(kpc)\n\nFig. 9.- Isothermal and NFW halo fits for F568-3.

If \u03a5\u2217MAX = 6.5, V\u2217 overshoots the innermost\nrotation curve point, but matches the cluster of points\nat \u223c 1.5 kpc and even crosses the lower errorbars on\npoints between 5 kpc and 10 kpc. The shape of the observed rotation curve is well-matched when \u03a5\u2217MAX =\n10.0; V\u2217 goes through the upper errorbars on points . 2\nkpc and agrees well with the data between 5 kpc and 10\nkpc. Fitting the inner observed rotation curve points or\nthe overall rotation curve shape are both equally plausible approaches to defining \u03a5\u2217MAX (Palunas & Williams\n2000), so we use both values in our halo fits.\nF563-1 is a good example of how the choice of \u03a5\u2217 affects the mass models, and the degeneracy between the\nluminous and dark components. While \u03a5\u2217P OP is our\nbest estimate for the stars, the data will clearly allow\na higher \u03a5\u2217 . To constrain the degeneracy between the\nstars and dark matter in cases like this, we need more\n\ninformation. The stellar velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk, for instance, would help to put limits on\nthe disk mass (Verheijen et al. 2007).\nDDO 64 \u2212 As Hi surface density profiles were unavailable for this galaxy, the baryons in the mass models are\nrepresented by the stars only. Multicolor photometry\nwas also unavailable, so a (B\u2013R) = 0.9 color was assumed for this dwarf galaxy (de Blok et al. 1995). DDO\n64 is better described by the isothermal halo than the\nNFW halo; forced c = 1 NFW fits are made for each\nvalue of \u03a5\u2217 . The stellar rotation curve falls below the\nobserved rotation curve with the exception of two low\npoints in the popsynth case, \u03a5\u2217P OP = 1.24. In the maximum disk case with \u03a5\u2217MAX = 5.0, however, V\u2217 is able\nto follow the data very well out to just past 1 kpc, and\nis even consistent with a data point at \u223c 1.5 kpc. With\n\u03a5\u2217MAX = 5.0, the stars are able to account for most of\nthe observed rotation, and the displayed isothermal halo\n\n\f16\n\nKuzio de Naray et al.\n\nUGC 5750 ISO\n\n0\n\nUGC 5750 NFW\n\nzero\n\nzero\n\nmin\n\nmin\n\npopsynth\n\npopsynth\n\nmax\n\nmax\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nr(kpc)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nr(kpc)\n\nFig. 10.- Isothermal and NFW halo fits for UGC 5750.

The shape\nof the stellar rotation curve is not well-matched to the\nobserved rotation curve and is only able to describe the\ninner 2 kpc of data, even in the maximum disk case.\nUGC 5750 \u2212 Because multicolor photometry was unavailable, a (B\u2013R) = 0.9 color was assumed for this\ngalaxy (de Blok et al. 1995). Excellent isothermal fits\nwere made for UGC 5750; the NFW halo provides very\npoor fits. Like F568-3, there is not a substantial difference between \u03a5\u2217P OP and \u03a5\u2217MAX .\nNGC 4395 \u2212 Multicolor photometry was unavailable\nfor this galaxy and \u03a5\u2217P OP = 1.4 (de Blok & Bosma\n2002) was assumed for the popsynth model. The NFW\nhalo is a slightly better fit to NGC 4395 than the isothermal halo, and the best-fitting concentrations are consistent with expectations from \u039bCDM. There is a substan-\n\ntial difference between \u03a5\u2217P OP and \u03a5\u2217MAX . For \u03a5\u2217P OP\n= 1.4, V\u2217 is well below the observed rotation curve; however, for \u03a5\u2217MAX = 9.0, V\u2217 is able to trace the data out\nto 8 kpc, the entire length of the rotation curve. Because\nthe baryons can explain the observed rotation so well in\nthe maximum disk case, the data want an isothermal\nhalo with an almost hollow core. We force a fit with an\nupper limit on \u03c10 and a lower limit on Rc . The baryons\ndo such a good job of explaining the observed rotation in\nthe maximum disk case that there is not even room for\nan NFW halo with c = 1.0. In the NFW maximum disk\nplot in Figure 11, the magenta line represents the total\n2\n2\nbaryonic rotation curve, Vdisk\n= V\u22172 + Vgas\n. It should\nbe noted that the nucleus of NGC 4395 is the least luminous known Seyfert 1 (Filippenko & Sargent 1989) and\nmay influence the inner rotation curve that we derive.\nF583-4 \u2212 The isothermal halo is a good description of\nthe data.

The entire observed rotation curve can be\nwell described by the stellar rotation curve when \u03a5\u2217MAX\nis turned up to 10.0. In this case, there is very little\nroom left for a dark matter halo, and only a limiting\nisothermal halo fit is made. Like NGC 4395, there is\nnot enough velocity left for an NFW halo with c = 1.0,\nand the magenta line in the maximum disk NFW plot in\nFigure 12 represents the total baryonic rotation curve.\nF583-1 \u2212 F583-1 is better fit by the isothermal halo\nthan the NFW halo. Additionally, the best-fitting NFW\nconcentrations are on the low side of expected values\nfrom \u039bCDM. Like F563-1, we consider two values of\n\u03a5\u2217MAX . With \u03a5\u2217MAX = 5.0, V\u2217 goes through the data\nwithin \u223c 1.5 kpc. V\u2217 goes through the upper errorbars\non the inner rotation curve, through the data at \u223c 2 kpc,\n\nand then through the lower errorbars on the data out to\n\u223c 3.5 kpc when \u03a5\u2217MAX = 10.0.\n8. DISCUSSION\n\nWhile one would like to know the true \u03a5\u2217 for each\ngalaxy, our data do not indicate that a particular estimator of \u03a5\u2217 is any better than another. In Figure 14\nwe show that the parameters of both the isothermal and\nNFW halo fits do not change much as \u03a5\u2217 changes. This\nconfirms that the details about what is assumed for the\nstars in LSB galaxies do not really matter. Unfortunately, it also means that without additional information, we cannot constrain \u03a5\u2217 in galaxies like F563-1 and\nF583-1 where a wide range of \u03a5\u2217 are applicable.\nThough the exact assumption about the stars may be\nunimportant, the stars cannot be entirely ignored. In\nreality, stars do not have zero mass. In fact, as the velocity contribution from the stars becomes more impor-\n\n\f18\n\nKuzio de Naray et al.\n\nF583-4 ISO\n\n0\n\nF583-4 NFW\n\nzero\n\nzero\n\nmin\n\nmin\n\npopsynth\n\npopsynth\n\nmax\n\nmax\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nr(kpc)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nr(kpc)\n\nFig. 12.- Isothermal and NFW halo fits for F583-4.

The left panel of\nFigure 14 illustrates that the isothermal core radius is\noften larger than \u223c 1 kpc. There is also a trend towards\nlarger Rc with increasing \u03a5\u2217 . This is important to recognize, as it shows that the cusp-core problem is not\nrestricted to the innermost radii only, particularly when\nstars are allowed to have mass. Also plotted in this figure is the \u03c10 -Rc scaling relation of Kormendy & Freeman\n(2004) (their equation 20) and the \u03c10 -R0 relation determined by Spano et al. (2007) (their figure 2). The\nKormendy & Freeman (2004) relation follows the data\nmore closely than the Spano et al. (2007) relation, however the maximum disk case points tend to drift below\nthe Kormendy & Freeman (2004) relation.\nThe c-V200 plot in the right panel of Figure 14 similarly shows the difficulty of fitting the centrally concentrated NFW halo to the data as the velocity contribution\n\nfrom the baryons becomes larger: as \u03a5\u2217 increases, fewer\ngalaxies can be fitted with an NFW halo. In particular,\nthe velocity contribution from the baryons is significant\nenough in the maximum disk case that maximum disk\nand the NFW halo are mutually exclusive.\nFor comparison, we have also included the predicted\nc-V200 lines for the high \u03c38 cosmology of Tegmark et al.\n(2004, hereafter T04) and the low \u03c38 WMAP3 cosmology\n(Spergel et al. 2007). The width of the bands is \u00b11\u03c3,\nassuming a scatter of \u03c3c = 0.14 (Bullock et al. 2001).\nThe data appear to follow a steeper c-V200 relation than\nboth predictions (see also McGaugh et al. 2007), and the\nconcentrations of the DensePak galaxies with NFW fits\nprimarily cluster between the WMAP3 lines. The median concentration of all the zero disk DensePak galaxies is c=4.5. At the corresponding V200 , the median\nc expected from T04 is \u223c8.2, and the median c expected from WMAP3 is \u223c6.1.

The low concentrations/central densities\nobserved in the data are more consistent with a power\nspectrum having a lower amplitude on small (galaxy)\nscales (see also McGaugh et al. 2003).\n8.1. Cusp Mass Excess\n\nIn \u00a7 5.2 we defined a constrained NFW halo,\nN F Wconstr , which was constructed to have a\ncosmologically-consistent concentration by forcing\nthe halo to match the velocities at the outer radii of\neach galaxy. We can now find N F Wconstr halos for\nthe dark matter rotation curves for each determination\nof \u03a5\u2217 . The rotation curves of the N F Wconstr halos\n\nover-predict the observed velocities interior to where\nthey are forced to agree. We can evaluate the difference\nbetween this expected CDM rotation curve and the\nobserved dark matter rotation curve in terms of velocity\ndifference, or alternatively, as a cusp mass excess. We\ncan ask what the difference is between the expected\ncuspy NFW halo mass and the dark matter mass that\nis allowed by the data. In the left panel of Figure 15,\nwe show the observed dark matter rotation curves of\nF568-3 for the zero, minimal, popsynth, and maximum\ndisk models. We also show the constrained NFW halo\nfor each dark matter rotation curve. In the right panel\nof Figure 15, we plot the same data in terms of mass\nusing M = V 2 R/G. To prevent a cluttered plot, we\nshow only the results for the popsynth model. The solid\nline is the enclosed mass as a function of radius for the\nN F Wconstr halo.

For\nboth cosmologies, the width of the bands is \u00b11\u03c3, assuming a scatter of \u03c3c = 0.14 (Bullock et al. 2001).

The black (solid), green (dotted),\nblue (short dash), and red/magenta (long dash/dot-long dash) lines are the zero, minimal, popsynth, and maximum disk cases, respectively.\nNear the centers of the galaxies there is a substantial cusp mass excess with at least two times more mass expected in the cuspy halo than\nis allowed by the data. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version of this figure.]\n\nIn our analysis so far, we have assumed that the observed velocity is the circular velocity (Vcirc = Vobsv ). If\nnoncircular motions are present, the true circular velocity\nmay be underestimated. This is the argument commonly\ngiven to explain the discrepancy between the NFW halo\nand the observations at small radii (e.g. Swaters et al.\n2003a; van den Bosch & Swaters 2001). To determine\nthe true circular velocity, the noncircular motions are\n2\nadded in quadrature to the observed velocities, Vcirc\n=\n2\n2\nVrot + \u03b2\u03c3 , usually assuming an isotropic dispersion (\u03b2\n= 3).\nWe can invert Figure 16 and determine how large\nthe noncircular motions must be in order to bring the\nobserved dark matter velocity into agreement with the\nN F Wconstr velocity. In Figure 17 we plot the required\n\u03c3(r), assuming an isotropic dispersion, for each galaxy.\n\nIn general, most of the galaxies need about 20 km s\u22121\nnoncircular motions at inner radii for the data to be consistent with the expectations of CDM. This is roughly\ntwice as large as the velocity dispersion in the DensePak\ndata (K06). It is also important to recognize the effect\nof stars not having zero mass. Instead of just having to\nconvince ourselves that \u223c20 km s\u22121 noncircular motions\nshould be added to the data, we actually must be willing\nto consider noncircular motions an additional 5-10 km\ns\u22121 higher when \u03a5\u2217 6= 0. Because we have forced the\nhalo velocity to match the observed velocity at large radius, our derived \u03c3(r) often show a steep drop to 0 km\ns\u22121 from \u223c 20 km s\u22121 . Strictly speaking, this behavior is unphysical, and a more continuous model could be\nderived. If \u03c3 contributes at large radii, however, that\nimplies that the halo has even more dark matter and \u03c3\nat small radii would have to be even higher.

The black (solid), green (dotted), blue (short dash), and red/magenta (long dash/dot-long dash)\nlines are the zero, minimal, popsynth, and maximum disk cases, respectively. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version\nof this figure.]\n\ncoming paper, we model the NFW halo and noncircular\nmotions, and Figure 17 provides us with testable predictions. For instance, we can use the results to test whether\nthe observations are consistent with N F W +\u03c3(r).\n9. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented updated DensePak velocity fields,\nrotation curves and zero disk halo fits for three galaxies\nfrom K06. We have also presented the velocity fields,\nderived rotation curves and zero disk halo fits for six\ngalaxies previously unobserved with DensePak. Overall,\nwe find the isothermal halo to be a better description\nof both the shape of the rotation curves and the central\ndensities of these nine galaxies in the limit of zero disk\nthan the NFW halo. When NFW fits could be made,\nthe concentrations were often beyond the range of values\nexpected for \u039bCDM. We also find that the quality of both\n\nthe isothermal and NFW halo fits is greatly improved\nwhen the radial range of the data extends into the flat\npart of the rotation curve.\nFor those DensePak galaxies with photometry, we have\nalso presented isothermal and NFW halo fits for four assumptions of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, \u03a5\u2217 . We have\ntested the zero, minimal, popsynth, and maximum disk\ncases. We have found that the NFW halo is a poor description of the data, and that the NFW halo and maximum disk are mutually exclusive. There is a substantial\ncusp mass excess near the centers of the galaxies with at\nleast two times more mass expected in the cuspy CDM\nhalo than is allowed by the data. Most galaxies in the\nsample require \u223c20 km s\u22121 noncircular motions to reconcile the differences between observations and the NFW\nhalo. Even larger noncircular motions are required when\nstars are allowed to have mass. We have also found the\n\n\fMass Models of LSB Galaxies\ndata to favor a low \u03c38 cosmology.\n10.
