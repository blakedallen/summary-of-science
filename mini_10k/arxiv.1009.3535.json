The situation may be worse around\nrich galaxy clusters which are found at the intersections\nof filaments where the true background population may\nbe significantly larger than in nearby less dense regions\nof sky. The statistical method therefore not only introduces large uncertainties due to field-to-field variance, but\nmay suffer from significant systematic bias as well.

Only in the Local and other very nearby groups,\nsuch as M81, can membership be determined directly for\nall potential members. Few rich galaxy clusters are close\nenough for a complete census. Historically, astronomers\nhave assigned membership probability based on indirect\nmeans such as colors or morphology, or have resorted to\nstatistical methods for estimating membership. The latter method estimates the number of galaxies belonging to\na cluster by correcting the total galaxy counts in a cluster region for the expected background population based\non galaxy counts in nearby or blank regions of the sky.\nThis statistical method may be the least secure as it as1\n\nGemini Observatory, 670 N.

We can, however,\nobserve a subsample of spectra to test memberships determined from indirect methods such as surface brightness,\nmorphology, and color criteria.\nUsing morphological criteria to establish membership involves weeding out objects with structure resembling that\nof background late type galaxies, and using surface brightness, scale length, and morphological class to constrain\nthe remainder. It is expected that most cluster galaxies\nare quiescent early-type galaxies that have relatively lower\nsurface brightness as compared to background objects. In\nrich galaxy clusters, the dwarf ellipticals form the dominant population at low luminosities. These galaxies have\nsmooth low surface brightness profiles and relatively large\nsizes compared to background galaxies with similar apparent magnitudes (e.g. Caldwell & Bothun 1987; Impey\net al. 1988; Ferguson & Sandage 1988). Thus, at faint\nmagnitudes, it is expected that cluster dwarf galaxies can\nbe distinguished from background galaxies by such properties as surface brightness and size. However, there is\nalways the possibility that these criteria could fail if, for\nexample, there existed a large population of very compact objects (e.g. compact dEs and UCDs) which reside\nwithin the cluster but are indistinguishable, morphologically, from background spheroidals or foreground stars,\nor if there existed a large population of giant low surface\nbrightness galaxies in the cluster background. Such possibilities can be tested with spectroscopic samples.\nThis work is part of the HST/ACS Coma Cluster Treasury Survey (Carter et al. 2008), a two-passband imaging survey originally designed to cover 740 arcmin2 in the\nComa Cluster to a depth of IC \u223c 26.6 for point sources\nand \u03bce,I < 26.0 mag arcsec\u22122 for extended sources. Over\n200 arcmin2 have been completed. The Coma Cluster was\nchosen because it is the densest, richest cluster of galaxies at high galactic latitude within 100 Mpc and will provide the local and current analog of rich clusters seen at\nhigher redshift. In addition, much progress has already\nbeen made towards understanding the cluster dynamics\nand galaxy properties of this rich cluster. The HST/ACS\nsurvey provides a database of high spatial resolution images with the overall goals to study the structure, stellar\npopulations, and morphologies of, and environmental effects on, the cluster dwarf galaxy population to a regime\nfainter than could be explored before. Specifically, we are\nusing the ACS data to study e.g. the faint end of the cluster galaxy luminosity function (Trentham et al. in prep),\nstructural parameters of dwarf galaxies (Hoyos et al. in\nprep), stellar populations (Smith et al. 2008), the nature\nof compact and ultra compact dwarf galaxies (Price et al.\n2009, Chiboucas et al. in prep), and globular cluster systems (Puzia et al. in prep, Peng (2010)). This study will\nmoreover provide the local rich cluster benchmark for various scaling relations.\nThe high quality ACS data are used to study structural,\nphotometric, and morphological properties of the cluster\nmembers. However, cluster members must first be identified. Several members of the team have therefore made use\nof morphological, surface brightness, and size criteria to as-\n\nsign a membership probability to each object in our ACS\nimages. As a follow-up to this ACS imaging survey, we are\ntherefore establishing membership for faint dwarf galaxies\nthrough spectroscopy for a subset of objects suspected of\nbeing cluster members. A separate MMT/Hectospec campaign has measured redshifts for over 8700 galaxies down\nto R \u223c 20, where it is \u223c 80% complete for the ACS surveyed region. We are using Keck/LRIS to obtain spectra\nof even fainter galaxies (19 < R < 24, \u221216 < MR < \u221211),\ntargeting both the low and high surface brightness segments of the dwarf population.\nGalaxies at the faint end of the luminosity function tend\nto be low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf ellipticals (Trentham et al. 2001; Ferguson & Binggeli 1994). To test our\nmembership assignments which follow from that assumption, we have observed samples of both low surface brightness faint galaxies expected to be members and higher surface brightness galaxies expected to lie in the background.\nWe target the central core of the Coma Cluster where we\nhave obtained high resolution HST/ACS imaging and have\ncompleted morphological estimates for membership.\nAt the very high surface brightness end of the spectrum\nlie the ultra compact dwarfs (UCDs). First discovered\nin spectroscopic studies of the Fornax cluster, including\nan all-object spectroscopic survey by Drinkwater et al.\n(2000), significant UCD populations have now been established to exist in the Fornax, Virgo, and Centaurus\nclusters (Hilker et al. 1999; Drinkwater et al. 2004; Firth\net al. 2008; Jones et al. 2006; Ha\u015fegan et al. 2005; Mieske\net al. 2007a, 2009) while candidate UCDs have been identified in the Hydra, A1689, AS0740, and Coma Clusters\nand the NGC 1023 group (Wehner & Harris 2007; Mieske\net al. 2004b; Blakeslee & Barber DeGraaff 2008; Adami\net al. 2009; Mieske et al. 2007b).\nUCDs have magnitudes in the range \u221213.5 < MV <\n\u221210.5 and are extremely compact, with physical sizes\nranging from 7 < re < 100 pc (Mieske et al. 2007a; Jones\net al. 2006; Mieske et al. 2008). In the Coma Cluster, this\nrange corresponds to angular sizes of 0.01 \u2212 0.2 arcsec.\nComa UCDs are therefore unresolved in typical groundbased imaging, and only the largest can be resolved with\nHST/ACS. With high surface brightness and low luminosities, they are well distinguished from the magnitude - surface brightness relation of \"typical\" dwarf galaxies. UCDs\nalso tend to be redder than the dE red sequence by \u223c 0.2\nmagnitudes. This property is likely driven by high metallicities (Mieske et al. 2006; Chilingarian et al. 2008). The\norigin of these enigmatic objects is not clear. They may be\nthe visible nuclei of extremely low surface brightness dwarf\ngalaxies or they may constitute a population of remnant\nnuclei formed from \"threshing\" of nucleated dwarf ellipticals via tidal encounters with giant galaxies (Phillipps\net al. 2001; Bekki et al. 2003; Ha\u015fegan et al. 2005). Alternatively, they may make up a bright tail of the globular\ncluster luminosity function or they may have formed as\nmergers of young massive star clusters themselves formed\nduring galaxy mergers (Drinkwater et al. 2000; Fellhauer\n& Kroupa 2002; Chilingarian et al. 2008). The population\nsize, spatial distribution, and intrinsic properties of this\nobject class, should UCDs exist within the Coma Cluster,\nwill provide critical new clues for understanding the formation mechanisms of these unusual objects, and expand\n\n\f3\nour understanding of the full dwarf galaxy population.\nIn Section 2 we detail the target selection, observations,\nand data reduction. We provide results of the spectroscopic study in Section 3 including the success rates for\nusing indirect means to estimate cluster membership. In\nSection 4 we discuss these results and in Section 5 we provide a summary and conclusions. Throughout this paper,\nwe assume a distance to the Coma Cluster of 100 Mpc and\na distance modulus \u03bc = 35 (see Carter et al. 2008, Table\n1).\n2. observations and data reduction\n\n2.1. Target Selection\nOur survey of faint dwarf galaxies in the Coma Cluster\nwas divided into the two surface brightness samples each\nwith a slightly different science objective. For the LSB\nsample the goal is to use redshift measurements to test our\nability to correctly determine membership for Coma Cluster galaxies through indirect means. This test provides\nstatistical probabilities for dwarf galaxy cluster membership, which are needed to constrain the poorly known\nfaint-end slope of the LF and to enable dwarf population\nstudies at the very faint regime. The goal of the high surface brightness sample is to investigate whether the Coma\nCluster hosts a population of UCDs.\nPrior to our initial observing run, redshifts existed for\nall galaxies in the Coma region with R < 17.5 and for\nalmost all expected members to R < 18.5. An ongoing\nMMT/Hectospec campaign has been targeting all galaxies with R < 20.0. Our plan was to take spectroscopic\nobservations 2 \u2212 3 magnitudes deeper. Our low surface\nbrightness targets were therefore chosen within the magnitude range 19 < R < 22.5, and with central surface\nbrightnesses \u03bco < 24. R\u2212band photometry was taken\nfrom the catalog of Adami et al. (2006). At high surface\nbrightness, we targeted objects to R < 24.\n2.1.1. Morphological Membership Assessment\nIndirect means are required to establish membership at\nfaint magnitudes where galaxy counts become too large for\ncomprehensive spectroscopic coverage. We therefore use\nknown and expected morphological and structural properties of the cluster population in order to distinguish between background and cluster galaxies in our high resolution ACS imaging. This method has been used previously\nfor studies of other nearby galaxy groups and clusters.\nOne of the historically more prominent uses was the assembly of the Virgo Cluster Catalog using primarily morphological means (Binggeli et al. 1985). Morphological\nclassification of galaxies in this region was performed by\nSandage & Binggeli (1984) who define the classification\nscheme and supply a reference set of examples to serve as\ntemplates. Cluster membership was then determined primarily based on the morphological classification for each\ngalaxy. More recently, this method has been used to assign\nmembership to nearby group and cluster galaxies in order\nto construct the galaxy luminosity functions (Trentham\net al. 2001; Trentham & Tully 2002; Mahdavi et al. 2005).\nThese studies used a very similar method as this work to\nassign membership to groups \u223c 4 times closer with \u223c 4\ntimes lower spatial resolution from ground-based imaging.\n\nThe majority of faint galaxies imaged within a field\nof even a rich galaxy cluster will be background galaxies. Faint cluster members are the dwarf galaxies, and\nwithin a rich cluster, the great majority of these will be of\nthe early type dE class. Both dwarf elliptical and dwarf\nirregular galaxies follow a well defined magnitude - surface brightness relation where surface brightness decreases\nwith magnitude such that the physical radius of the galaxy\nremains nearly constant (e.g. Caldwell & Bothun 1987;\nBinggeli & Cameron 1991; Binggeli 1994; Mieske et al.\n2004a; Boselli et al. 2008). Thus, at a given apparent magnitude, dwarf cluster members are expected to be of lower\nsurface brightness and to have larger sizes than the majority of background galaxies. The dwarf members are also\nexpected to have roughly similar sizes. Furthermore, late\ntype field background galaxies can be distinguished based\non morphological and structural properties. The presence\nof features such as spiral arms, dust lanes, evidence for\ntidal disruption, flat edge-on disks, central bulges, major\nbars, etc. are all good indicators for late type morphology more likely to be associated with intrinsically high\nluminosity background galaxies than intrinsically low luminosity dwarf members.\nAll ACS images from our survey were visually inspected\nby two of the authors (NT and HF) who closely followed\nthe Sandage & Binggeli (1984) prescription for galaxy classification. Galaxies in the Coma Cluster fields were then\nplaced into 4 membership categories based on the following considerations. Objects at R > 19 that are compact\nand/or have spiral or other obvious structure indicative\nof intrinsically luminous galaxies were assumed to lie in\nthe background. From the magnitude - surface brightness\nrelation, faint members are expected to have low surface\nbrightness and relatively large sizes in comparison with the\nabundant background galaxies of similar apparent magnitude. These mostly featureless diffuse LSB galaxies are\nassigned to the dE class and are assumed to be members.\nLSB galaxies with small central nuclei are morphologically assigned to be of the dE,N class and can also be\nidentified as members with relative certainty. Besides the\nobvious members and background galaxies there will be\nsome cases where the membership cannot be unambiguously determined based on morphological grounds alone.\nThe following probability ranking scheme, described further in Trentham et al. (in prep), was then used to assign\na membership likelihood to each galaxy:\n1: Expected member\n2: Probable member\n3: Possible member\n4: Expected background\nExamples from each class are shown in Figures 1 - 3. We\ncannot provide a specific recipe for assigning memberships.\nThis rating scheme is subjective and therefore not perfectly reproducible. However, it is expected that a human\ncan be trained through experience looking at many images\nin different contexts to morphologically classify galaxies\nand reliably pick out members from qualitative determinations better than any devised algorithm. Both authors\nhere have significant experience with this technique. Given\n\n\f4\n\nChiboucas et al.\n\nprevious success using this method to determine membership for nearby group and cluster members, it is expected\nthat this method will have good success in assigning membership for the more distant Coma Cluster galaxies (100\nMpc) using high resolution HST/ACS images. We test\nthis hypothesis in this paper.\nTo test the reliability of these membership assignments,\nwe chose samples from each of the 4 membership classes for\nfollow-up spectroscopy. We weighted all possible targets\nbased on membership probability, giving higher weights\nto those galaxies considered likely and probable members\n(ranking 1-2), a lower weighting for those considered possible members (3), and the lowest weighting for those considered background (4). These weights were used strictly\nin the LRIS mask making software, Autoslit3, and were\nimplemented primarily to obtain roughly equal numbers\nof each category in the final masks, since total numbers\nof objects increased inversely with membership likelihood.\nIn the end, \u223c 20 \u2212 25 objects were chosen from each of the\nmembership classes. In order to ensure that the majority\nof spectra were of high enough S/N to measure redshifts,\nwe also gave slightly greater weight to those objects with\nhigher surface brightness. While this is a selection bias,\nthe main goal was to obtain high enough S/N for as many\ntargets as possible from which to extract secure redshift\nmeasurements. The sample for which we successfully measured redshifts has a large enough range to investigate any\npossible bias or trend as a function of surface brightness.\nWe discuss this further in Section 4.\n2.1.2. UCD Candidate Selection\nThe second goal of our spectroscopic survey was to\nsearch for the existence of a UCD population within the\ndynamically evolved Coma Cluster. UCDs are extremely\ncompact and faint objects having apparent magnitudes at\nthe distance of Coma in the range 21.5 < V < 24.5, colors up to 0.2 magnitudes redder than the red sequence,\nand half-light radii corresponding to 0.01 \u2212 0.2 arcsec. In\nground-based surveys, these objects are not resolved, but\nwith the resolution of ACS the larger ones are just resolved. It is therefore challenging, even with HST imaging,\nto distinguish these near point sources from foreground\nstars.\nTo choose a sample of UCD candidates, we first identified point sources in the catalog of Adami et al. (2006)\nbased on their large ground-based CFHT/CFH12K survey.\nWe then imposed the following criteria:\n1. R < 24 (300 aperture mags)\n2. 0.45 < (B \u2212 V ) < 1.1 (300 apertures)\n3. Higher priority to sources with 0.15 < R \u2212 I < 0.6\n4. Located in regions with processed ACS images\n(available before 2007 February)\n5. Gave highest weight to sources showing any sign\nof having profiles broader than stellar in our ACS\nimages.\nThis last point biases the sample to larger objects although\nunresolved sources were included in the target list as well.\nThe (B \u2212 V ) range includes the Fornax/Virgo UCDs at\n\nthe blue end and compact ellipticals (cEs) at the red end.\nIn part because of potentially large photometric errors at\nthese faint magnitudes, we refrained from making our color\ncut too restrictive. The final list contains 165 UCD candidates. The weights were implemented by the Autoslit3\nmask making software for choosing targets.\n2.2. Observations\nThe spectroscopic setup was intended to maximize light\nthroughput at the expense of resolution. As we only need\nto establish cluster membership for these galaxies, and the\nComa Cluster has a velocity dispersion of \u223c 1000 km/s, a\nresolution of 200 km/s is adequate. The spectral range was\nchosen to include the Ca H and K lines and Balmer break\nat the blue end (\u223c 4080\u00c5 at the redshift of Coma) and\nthe Ca triplet at the red end (around 8600\u00c5). Because the\nmost critical spectral features for redshift measurements\nof low redshift, faint galaxies are the Ca H & K lines and\nBalmer break, we require high sensitivity in the blue.\nIn order to attain these specifications, we use the Keck\nLRIS low resolution imaging spectrometer (Oke et al.\n1995) in multi-object spectroscopy mode. A dichroic was\nused to split light at 5600\u00c5 between red and blue detectors. On the blue-side, we used the 400 line mm\u22121 grism\nblazed at 3400\u00c5 providing a dispersion of 1.09\u00c5 pix\u22121 and\nwavelength coverage of 4384\u00c5. With 1.2 arcsec slitlets, we\nachieved a resolution of \u223c7.8\u00c5 FWHM. On the red-side\nwe chose the 400 line mm\u22121 grating blazed at 8500\u00c5 with\nwavelength coverage 3950\u00c5 and 1.92\u00c5 pix\u22121 dispersion.\nThese provide peak efficiencies of 50% at 3900\u00c5 and over\n40% at 7000\u00c5, along with the intended full wavelength\ncoverage.\nWe observed 4 masks over 2 nights 2-3 April 2008. Details of these observations are provided in Table 1. Each\nMOS mask covers a field of view of 50 \u00d7 80 . Total integrations for each mask were 8 \u00d7 1500s with the exception\nof the blue side of the 3rd mask for which we only obtained 6 \u00d7 1500s. The masks covered 4 separate fields with\nonly slight overlap (4 objects were observed in 2 masks\neach), and nearly cover the full core region with completed\nACS imaging. A total of 140 objects were targeted with\nthe 4 LRIS masks for an average of 35 slitlets per mask.\nThese included 20 expected background galaxies (membership probability 4), 73 low surface brightness probable/potential cluster members (membership probabilities\n1-3), and 47 UCD candidates. In Figure 4, we overlay the\nlocations of the 4 LRIS fields on an image of the central\nComa Cluster region. Red boxes designate the originally\nproposed locations for the ACS imaging; those highlighted\nin yellow have been completed. The locations of targets\nare also shown.\nA subsequent observing run in 2009 focused on the continuation of our UCD search. UCD discoveries will be\npresented in a future paper. However we did measure redshifts for two new LSB members. We include these measurements in Table 2, but as these two objects are not\nstatistically relevant to the discussion in this paper, we do\nnot discuss them further.\nCalibration arc lamps were observed each evening and\nsky lines were used to determine observational shifts.\nDome and halogen lamp flats were also observed daily.\nThe signal-to-noise per Angstrom for the galaxy spectra\n\n\f5\nranges from \u223c 60 to less than 1. The brightest high surface\nbrightness objects had S/N (around 5000\u00c5) > 20. Typical S/N for the low surface brightness dwarfs for which\nwe were able to measure redshifts ranged from \u223c 4 \u2212 15\naround 5000\u00c5. For the UCD sample, membership was established for targets having S/N > 4.5 while less secure\nredshifts were derived from spectra with 2.5 < S/N < 4.5.\n2.3. Data Reduction\nData were reduced using the standard procedures in\nIRAF. We first overscan/bias corrected the images using tasks lccdproc/lrisbias. For the blue-side data, 2 CCD\nchips read out with 4 amplifiers were corrected for different\ngains and tiled into a single image. Data on the red-side\nwere likewise corrected for 2-amp readout. Halogen flats\nfor each mask were combined and a normalized flat image was generated with apflatten. Science MOS images\nwere divided by this flat, and the 8 individual exposures\nfor each mask were subsequently median combined using\nsigma clipping after first fixing bad columns.\nSlit spectra were rectified by first tracing the slit gaps\nfor each mask and fitting these with 4th order legendre\npolynomials. geomap was run to compute the 2D surface\nfor the full set of slit gaps in a mask and geotran was then\nrun to generate images with straightened slits using that\ntransformation. Once this operation was completed, individual 2-D spectra were cut out. Arc spectra were rectified\nand extracted for each slitlet in the same manner.\nWe ran the IRAF tasks identify (reidentify) and fitcoord\nto wavelength calibrate the lamp spectra, and transform\nto calibrate the object spectra using these arc wavelength\nsolutions. Sky lines in the slitlet spectrum of each object\nwere used to correct for offsets from the lamp wavelength\ncalibrations. On the blue-side spectra, the shift was calculated primarily with the 5577\u00c5 emission line. However, in\nmany spectra this line was at the very edge of the spectrum\nor, for objects with slits at the edge of the mask, missing\nfrom the spectrum altogether. Because we were unable to\naccurately correct for the shift in many spectra, we believe\nwe may suffer from systematic errors as large as 100 km/s.\nTo extract 1-dimensional spectra, we used apall to identify\nthe spectrum center, width, and sky regions. The RVSAO\npackage was used, along with absorption and emission line\ntemplate spectra, to measure cross correlated redshifts.\nIn the red-side spectra we had to contend with bright\nskylines redward of 7000\u00c5. Sky regions within the slitlet\nwere used to subtract these out, but residual noise in most\ncases is brighter than the target galaxy signal. We therefore only used these spectra when the source signal was\nbright and to search for emission lines.\n3. results\n\nIn Fig. 5, we display 6 spectra for dE and dE,N galaxies\nfrom which we obtained redshift measurements, arranged\nin order of increasing R\u2212band magnitude. The majority\nof redshifts for Coma member galaxies were measured using prominent lines in the blue, in particular the Ca H&K,\nBalmer break, and H\u03b2 lines. High redshifts were more often measured from emission lines in the red-side spectra.\nSpectra from our faint and low surface brightness dwarfs\nwere most often too faint to extract redshift measurements\nfrom our red-side spectra due to bright sky emission.\n\nThe mean redshift of the Coma Cluster is cz \u223c 6925 km\ns\u22121 with \u03c3 \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 (Wegner et al. 1999; Gurzadyan\n& Mazure 2001; Shao et al. 1994; Edwards et al. 2002). We\ntake Coma members to be those galaxies within 3\u03c3 of the\ncluster mean velocity, or between 4000 \u2212 10000 km s\u22121 . In\ntotal we measured redshifts for 70 Coma Cluster members\nincluding 19 UCDs. Spectra for the 19 objects confirmed\nas UCDs are provided in Chiboucas et al. (in prep). Another 14 objects have less secure redshift measurements\nconsistent with Coma Cluster membership including 6 potential UCDs. Redshifts confirmed that another 24 objects\nare background galaxies while 6 UCD candidates proved\nto be foreground stars. For the remainder of the targets,\nthe S/N of the spectra was too low to extract redshifts. In\ntotal, we measured redshifts for over 80% of our targets.\nWe present the redshift measurements in Table 2 for the\nnon-UCD sample and display histograms of the radial velocities in Fig 6. Redshift measurements for the UCDs are\nprovided in Chiboucas et al. (in prep).\nIn Figure 7 we compare radial velocity measurements\nfor galaxies that overlapped in the Hectospec sample. The\naverage difference for all 10 galaxies in common is 32 km\ns\u22121 . Two objects differ by nearly 100 km s\u22121 . These\nare objects which were observed on the far edge of LRIS\nmasks cutting off much of the red portion of the spectra.\nFor these galaxies, and up to 11% of the sample, the blueside spectra cut off at the red end by \u223c 5300\u00c5. There are\nfew arc lines in this region, so the wavelength calibration is\nnot well constrained at the red end, and no sky lines from\nwhich to determine relative shifts from the arc calibration. We therefore expect larger uncertainties for galaxies\nlocated along one side of the masks. However, neither the\nsmall systematic offset from Hectospec velocities nor larger\nuncertainties for some galaxies are significant compared to\nthe Coma Cluster velocity dispersion, and so do not affect\nthe cluster membership determination.\nFor 51 non-UCD member galaxies, we find hvr i =\n6970 \u00b1 178 with \u03c3v = 1269 \u00b1 126. Excluding the one highest redshift object at 9870 km/s, we find hvr i = 6912 \u00b1 172\nwith \u03c3v = 1213 \u00b1 122. Edwards et al. (2002) found a mean\nradial velocity for the Coma Cluster of 6925 km s\u22121 with\nvelocity dispersions for the giant and dwarf galaxy populations of 979 \u00b1 30 and 1096 \u00b1 45 km s\u22121 respectively. The\nvelocity dispersion found for our faint, low surface brightness sample is 1\u03c3 larger than their dwarf galaxy measurement. This may be due in part to the smaller sample size\nor smaller field coverage of this study, and in particular\nwith the fact that our sample is confined to the cluster\ncore since velocity dispersion typically decreases with projected radius in clusters. However, it is also consistent\nwith the trend of increasing velocity dispersion with decreasing galaxy luminosity (or mass) previously found for\nthe Coma cluster and which may be due to dynamical\nfriction processes that lead to equipartition (Adami et al.\n1998).\nFrom the low S/N failures, we can determine our spectroscopic survey limits. We find that in our 3.3 hr integrated exposures, we are able to measure redshifts for\nall targets with central surface brightness higher than\n\u03bc\u25e6 (R) < 23 mag arcsec\u22122 . For well resolved galaxies,\nwe are able to measure redshifts down to \u03bc\u25e6 (R) = 23.6\nfor galaxies brighter than R < 22 (or to mean effective\n\n\f6\n\nChiboucas et al.\n\nsurface brightness h\u03bcie,F 814W < 23.8 for galaxies brighter\nthan F 814W < 22). For the quasi-point source UCD candidates, we reach a magnitude deeper, becoming incomplete at R \u223c 22.9 and F 814W \u223c 23.3 (see Fig. 13-14).\nFrom the redshift measurements of the sample selected\nto test membership probabilities we find a high success\nrate for establishing membership through indirect means.\nOf the 50 objects in our LSB sample that were confirmed\nto be members, 43 were expected to be members (probability classes 1-2) by one or both of NT and HF. Only 7 had\nbeen designated class 3-4 by both. We display thumbnails\nof these 7 morphologically ambiguous objects in Figure 8.\nAll 7 are classified as types other than dE. One is classified\nas an irregular, 4 as normal ellipticals, and 2 as S0 and dS0.\nThis last was given the membership probability 3 (uncertain) by both authors. Based on the spectroscopic redshifts, we see that two of the confirmed members classified\nas E types (91543, 122743) are in fact compact elliptical\n(cE) galaxies. The other two galaxies classified as Es are\neven more compact high surface brightness objects. One\n(151072) may be a member of the UCD class based on its\nsize and surface brightness. The other (242439) is larger\nand appears to have a low surface brightness envelope with\nsome additional structure. The objects correctly identified\nas members based on morphology and surface brightness\nare largely of the dE and dE,N classes with only a few\nexceptions. The failures are largely featureless, and often\nround, compact early types.\nOf the 20 confirmed background objects, 17 had been\ncorrectly assigned a 4 (definite background) by at least\none author. The remaining 3 had been classified as 3 (uncertain) by at least one author. We show these 3 objects\nin Figure 9. It is easy to understand the confusion of two\nof these objects with cE and dE,N type cluster galaxies.\nThese results indicate very good success for establishing\nmembership through indirect means, although failures are\nclearly due to morphological biases inherent in using this\nmethodology. We graphically display these results in Fig.\n10. The shaded histogram shows, as a function of the average membership probability, the number of objects confirmed to be members while the open hatched histogram\nshows counts for confirmed background galaxies. For objects designated as 1-2 by both authors, we find a 100%\nsuccess rate. For objects classified as 4 (background) by\nboth, we find a 91% success rate. We note that our small\nbackground sample does not reflect the full range of likely\nbackground galaxies. The great majority of background\ngalaxies have spiral arms and other tell-tale features and\ncan be confidently associated with the background. We\nexpect this 91% success rate to therefore be a lower limit.\nBetween the expected member and background galaxies, in\nthe range where at least one author designated the galaxy\nas an uncertain 3, we encounter the problem cases. Objects with an average probability of 2.5 turned out to be\nmembers 75% of the time, those with a probability of 3\nturned out to be members half of the time, and those with\na probability of 3.5 turned out to be members 42% of the\ntime. On average, for these 22 cases where at least one author chose the uncertain probability 3, 55% turned out to\nbe members while 45% turned out to be background. This\nis very close to a 50-50 split one might expect for such an\nuncertain category. For the full sample of morphologically\n\nclassified galaxies in our ACS fields, this would imply that\n\u223c 90% of 400 galaxies ranked 1 \u2212 2.5 may be expected to\nbe members and > 70% of 364 galaxies designated 3.5 \u2212 4\nmay be expected to lie in the background. Another \u223c 150\ngalaxies from the uncertain category 3.0 may also prove to\nbe members.\nIn summary, we find that if mistakes are made with\nmembership assignments based on morphology, it is often\nbecause a small fraction of textureless high surface brightness objects taken to be in the background are compact\ndwarfs in the cluster. Candidates expected to be members\nalmost always are. Candidates in the uncertain category\nsplit almost evenly between member and non-member.\nFor the UCD sample, our spectroscopy measurements\nbecome incomplete by R = 23.3. For targets brighter than\nthis, where we are able to measure secure redshifts, an astonishing 19, or 66%, have turned out to be members.\nOnly 4 targets were found to lie in the background while\n6 proved to be stars. We discuss these results in greater\ndetail in Chiboucas et al. (in prep).\nOne object (92663) targeted originally as a UCD candidate was confirmed to be a cluster member with vr = 7525\nkm s\u22121 through unusually strong emission lines. We show\nthe relative flux calibrated red and blue-side spectra in\nFig. 11. The spectrum exhibits strong emission lines along\nwith continuum. No absorption lines are apparent in this\nspectrum. Nebular He and a Wolf-Rayet bump centered\naround restframe 4660\u00c5 are also visible, indicative of a\nyoung starburst. Placing our line strength measurements\nof log [O III]5007/H\u03b2 (0.6) and log [N II]6583/H\u03b1 (-1.0) on\na BPT diagram (Baldwin et al. 1981), we find our object\nlies on the branch of objects that are strongly star forming/HII regions. Because these are line ratios of neighboring lines, effects of reddening and flux calibration uncertainties are minimized. From [NII]\u03bb6583/ H\u03b1 (the N2\nindex) we calculate the oxygen abundance 12 + log(O/H)\n= 8.3 using the relation found by Pettini & Pagel (2004),\nsomewhat lower than the solar value 8.66. We measure an\nequivalent width of 1008\u00c5 for H\u03b1 well above the threshold\nfor the definition of a starburst (Lee et al. 2009). Using\nSTARBURST99 models (Leitherer et al. 1999), we estimate an age of this starburst of 3.1 \u2212 4.1 Myr depending\non the model parameters used, consistent with the WolfRayet features observed in the spectrum. As might be\nexpected from the strong H\u03b1 emission line, this object has\nbeen detected in both NUV and FUV with GALEX along\nwith H\u03b1 imaging from the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope.\nThese data are discussed further in Smith et al. (2010).\nThis object, targeted as a UCD candidate, has a magnitude and size in the F 814W band expected for UCDs.\nJust to the west of this object, and just outside the slit,\nis another object visible in the F 814W image with a high\nsurface brightness core and distorted envelope (Fig. 12).\nHowever, from the F 475W band image, we find these two\nobjects are very blue and more extended than seen in the\nF 814W image. They are most likely associated, perhaps\nas an interacting pair or a single dwarf irregular galaxy\nhaving two separate star bursting regions. The targeted\nobject is most likely a large HII/OB complex. The magnitude of the targeted object is F 814W = 23.1, the one just\nabove is a half magnitude brighter. Both objects are quite\nblue: the targeted source has F 475W \u2212 F 814W = \u22120.93\n\n\f7\nwhile the second object has F 475W \u2212 F 814W = \u22120.37.\nThe double object spans \u223c 2.5 arcsec, or at the distance\nof Coma, 1.1 kpc.\nWe note that there is another unusual blue object in the\nimmediate vicinity which appears to be a tidal stream or\ntidally disturbed galaxy with brighter patches at one end\nhaving, presumably, high star formation rates. If this object is also a Coma Cluster member, these two star bursting objects would be separated by a projected distance of\n\u223c 4.4 kpc. It would seem unusual to find such strongly\nstar forming objects in an old, evolved cluster. However,\nsimilar objects have been found in the Coma core region.\nYoshida et al. (2008) find an unusual starbursting complex\nto the southwest of the core which they refer to as 'fireballs' due to the multiple blue blobs and streams associated with this object. The fireballs appear to be associated\nwith a nearby merger remnant galaxy. Near the 'fireballs',\nYagi et al. (2007) find a long H\u03b1 emitting stream associated with a post-starburst galaxy. In a study of Coma\nsupercluster galaxies, Mahajan et al. (2010) find that starforming dwarf galaxies on first infall through the dense intracluster medium undergo a burst of star formation and\nare subsequently quenched. This may be what we are seeing here, although tidal effects could also play a role. This\nemission line object is discussed further in Smith et al.\n(2010).\n4. discussion\n\nWe display membership results in magnitude - surface\nbrightness space in Figures 13 - 14. R-band photometry\ncomes from the ground-based Adami et al. (2006) catalog. F 814W photometry comes from SExtractor measurements from our ACS data (Hammer et al. 2010). Underlying symbols denote the original membership probability.\nThose highlighted in green circles were confirmed through\nredshifts to be members, while red squares highlight the\nbackground galaxies. Cyan circles represent confirmed\nUCDs. Two roughly parallel sequences of cluster members\nare visible in these figures. The normal dwarf population\nlies along the low surface brightness end of the range and\nfollows the well known magnitude - surface brightness relation for dwarf ellipticals. On the other side of the surface\nbrightness spectrum are the very high surface brightness\nand compact UCDs which appear to follow a sequence parallel to that of the dEs. This region is closely bounded by\nthe stellar sequence. Note that due to seeing limitations,\nthe ground based photometry generates narrow UCD and\nstellar sequences that merge and are bounded on the high\nsurface brightness side by the seeing disk. Although there\nis still some overlap, ACS measurements expand this surface brightness space and do a better job at separating\nUCDs and stars. In between the compact and LSB sequences, the great majority of objects are confirmed and\nexpected background galaxies.\nThese figures demonstrate that, at least in the case\nof normal dwarf galaxies, surface brightness is a good,\nand reliable, indicator of membership. In the lowest surface brightness regime, all objects with measured redshifts\nare members. This result is significant because our spectroscopic survey becomes incomplete due to low surface\nbrightness before becoming incomplete at faint magnitudes. From these diagrams, we may assume that lower\n\nsurface brightness galaxies without spectra, brightward of\nF 814W \u223c 21.5, are members as expected from their membership probability classes.\nHowever, these figures also illuminate several issues with\nthis indirect membership assignment technique. At intermediate surface brightnesses, member galaxies overlap\nin magnitude and surface brightness with the background\npopulation. In this region we will expect greater uncertainty with the membership assignments. Also evident\nis the surface brightness bimodality in the Coma Cluster\nmember population. At the highest surface brightnesses,\nthere is a second significant population of UCD cluster\nmembers which overlap, even in ACS images, with the stellar sequence. The UCD sequence may continue to brighter\nmagnitudes than we find here, but in our 2008 observing run we did not target any UCD candidates brighter\nthan R = 21.5. In addition there are a pair of cEs that\nfall within the surface brightness-magnitude region of the\nbackground population. It is strikingly apparent that if\nthese two classes of compact objects constitute significant\npopulations in the Coma Cluster, we may be seriously\nmis-representing the Coma Cluster galaxy population and\nassociated properties in our comprehensive cluster study\nwhen using surface brightness criteria to assign membership.\nA number of questions must be addressed. We need\nto determine if compact dwarf ellipticals compose a significant fraction of the cluster population, and how they\nmight be identified using other means than spectroscopy.\nThis is addressed in Price et al. (2009). With a total of\n7 confirmed members at present, it does not appear that\ncompact dwarf galaxies form a large Coma Cluster population. Similarly, we need to determine whether UCDs\ncontribute significantly to the overall cluster dwarf population, how they might be identified short of all-object\nspectroscopic surveys, and, most importantly, what type\nof object these are. We address these questions in detail in\nChiboucas et al. (in prep). A \u223c60% success rate with our\ninitial observations indicates a large population. However,\nwe do not yet know whether these objects are the stripped\nremains of nucleated dwarf ellipticals or simply giant star\nclusters, perhaps forming the bright tail of the globular\ncluster luminosity distribution.\nWe consider other means of identifying cluster members. In our original classification, color information was\nnot used. We display color-magnitude diagrams in Figure\n15. The red sequence of early type cluster members is immediately apparent (highlighted green circles). We include\nthe best fit to the red sequence of 120 14 < R < 19 galaxies extended to the faint magnitudes here and find that\nthe red sequence is continuous down to at least R < 22.\nBrightward of R or F 814W = 21.5(MR/F 814W = \u221213.5),\nwe expect that color can be used to distinguish members\nfrom background galaxies with high success. There are\nonly three discrepant points. One background galaxy, originally classified as an uncertain membership probability 3\nfalls right along the red sequence. Incorporating colors in\nthe membership determination would most likely have led\nto the mis-identification of this galaxy as a cluster member. Two members lie 0.2 magnitudes redward of the red\nsequence. These are the already mis-identified cE galaxies. Including color information for these may reinforce\n\n\f8\n\nChiboucas et al.\n\nthe mis-identification as background galaxies. This study\nsuggests that compact ellipticals with B \u2212 V colors \u223c 0.2\nmagnitudes redward of the red sequence warrant spectroscopic attention. We also find that the confirmed UCDs\nhave a large and unexpected color spread. There appears\nto be a subset that may follow the faint extension of the\nred sequence while the remainder of UCDs have extraordinarily red colors. Thus, although we would expect that\nincorporating color information will improve our overall\nmembership assignment success rate, especially for galaxies in the uncertain probability 3 category, and can certainly be used to reliably exclude very red high redshift\ngalaxies, it fails for some of the same objects as morphology and surface brightness criteria. Other means to differentiate between background and cluster members, such as\nthe use of structural parameters, are being investigated.\nThe observed bimodal distribution of member surface\nbrightnesses therefore complicates membership determinations. We find that our membership assignments are\nlargely successful to R = 21.5. We have not yet uncovered a UCD population brighter than this. Our largest\nsource of uncertainty in this range would appear to be\ndue to the cE class. If these objects do not comprise a\nlarge galaxy population, we may expect to have nearly\ncomplete and accurate membership information down to\nMR = \u221213.5. We are, however, continuing to investigate\nthis in future work, including new LRIS and Hectospec observations specifically designed to search for bright UCDs\nand faint cEs.\nMichard & Andreon (2008) establish membership for\nComa Cluster galaxies using a very similar method. Based\non morphology, surface brightness, and size criteria they\nidentify members in CFHT/CFH12K B and V imaging.\nThey found good agreement with literature redshift results down to a completeness limit of MB = \u221215 (B = 20),\nor, assuming B \u2212 R \u223c 1.2, to R \u223c 18.8 (MR = \u221216.2).\nAt the time, spectroscopic redshifts were nonexistent for\nmost galaxies fainter than this. We compare our results\nand find 19 objects in common. Of 2 spectroscopically\nconfirmed non-member galaxies, they correctly identified\nboth as background. Of 17 confirmed members, they correctly assign 9 as probable members, while incorrectly classifying 8 as distant spirals. Our membership probabilities\nfor these same objects based on ACS images correctly assigned 16 of the 17 members as definite to likely members\nalthough also incorrectly assign one of the two background\nobjects as a likely member. Overall, our membership assignments do a better job at these faint magnitudes and\nsurface brightnesses due to the much higher spatial resolution of the HST/ACS images. Since the success of\nmorphological memberships is directly related to the spatial resolution of the imaging this method can presently\nonly be used for very nearby groups and clusters; at the\ndistance of the Coma Cluster, spaced-based imaging becomes necessary. At greater distances, it becomes difficult\nto use this method to probe to the same limiting magnitudes (MR = \u221212) as this study. Galaxies become fainter\nand smaller, more cluster galaxies with brighter intrinsic\nmagnitudes will not have spectroscopic redshifts, and evolutionary effects may become a factor. We expect this\nmethod to be useful using HST/ACS images for clusters\nand groups within \u223c 100 Mpc.\n\n5. summary and conclusions\n\nIn summary, we have used spectroscopic redshifts to\ntest the success rate for establishing Coma Cluster membership through indirect means such as morphology, surface brightness, size, and color criteria. Using Keck/LRIS\nmulti-object spectroscopy, we targeted 93 galaxies to test\nmembership probability assignments using these indirect\nmeans, and another 47 compact objects to search for\nUCDs.\nThe results of the membership tests showed that we\ncan use surface brightness, size, and morphology criteria,\nwhen based on high resolution ACS images, with good success. We find a high success rate, with 100% of galaxies\nthat were expected to be members proving to be members, and over 90% of galaxies expected to lie in the background proving to be background objects. In practice,\nwe expect this latter percentage to be higher, since the\nvast majority of expected background galaxies are those\nwhich exhibit structural features like spiral arms and these\ncan be confidently associated with the background. Our\nsmall sample of expected background galaxies does not reflect the full background population. It is only between\nthese expected member and expected background categories, where galaxy memberships were assigned as 'uncertain' possible members, do we experience a breakdown\nwith this method. In these cases the failure rate for correctly assigning objects as (possible) members is about\n50%, as might be expected. These are primarily cases of\ngalaxies with surface brightness intermediate between low\nsurface brightness dEs and higher surface brightness background galaxies.\nIn addition to these normal dwarf galaxies, we confirm\n19 Coma Cluster UCDs with magnitudes in the range\n21.5 < R < 23.5 (\u221213.5 < R < \u221211.5) and having a large\nspread in color which ranges from the expected color at the\nfaint extension of the red sequence to 0.4 magnitudes redder than the red sequence. We discuss this sample further\nin Chiboucas et al. (in prep).\nThe main conclusions from this study are as follows.\nThe dominant cluster population, dwarf elliptical galaxies,\nfollow a magnitude - surface brightness relation (which exhibits some scatter in surface brightness) in which dwarfs\ndecrease in surface brightness at fainter magnitudes with\nlittle change in size. This property allows for the use of\nsurface brightness and size as cluster membership indicators for dwarf galaxies. From our spectroscopic results we\ndetermine that very low surface brightness galaxies can\nindeed be confidently associated with the cluster. It is\nonly at the higher surface brightness side of the magnitude - surface brightness relation that some ambiguity enters into the membership determination as members and\nbackground galaxies begin to merge and membership assignments become uncertain. For statistical purposes, we\nfind that objects with uncertain membership assignments\nmay be considered members with \u223c 50% probability. It\nis only near the intermediate surface brightness boundary between members and non-members where this will\nbe a problem; the majority of dwarf galaxies have lower\nsurface brightnesses and can safely be assigned as cluster\nmembers.\nThat said, we find that dwarf cluster members are\nclearly separated into LSB and the compact cE and UCD\n\n\f9\nfamilies. The Coma Cluster galaxy population consists of\nthe established low surface brightness dwarf galaxies and,\non the other side of the surface brightness spectrum falling\nfar off the magnitude - surface brightness relation of dE\ngalaxies, are the very high surface brightness UCDs. In\nbetween, largely within the range of the background population, are the cEs. It is possible that UCDs and cEs\nform a single family of objects; the two-magnitude gap\nbetween these two populations at \u221215 < MR < \u221213 must\nbe explored. Membership criteria which stipulate low surface brightness will fail entirely for these compact galaxy\ntypes.\nWe did not use colors in our initial membership probability assignments, but we investigate the membership\nresults in terms of galaxy color. For the most part, we\nfind colors do at least as well as surface brightness and\nsize criteria in distinguishing member from non-member\ngalaxies. Most cluster dwarfs follow an obvious red sequence. However, color criteria fail for many of the same\nobjects, namely the cE and UCD classes, where other indirect means fail. Thus, colors provide a good discriminant\nmost of the time but must be lenient on the red side to\ncatch the cE and UCD components of the cluster population. Spectroscopy is required to establish membership\nfor these object types.\nOverall, we find good success using morphology and\nstructural characteristics based on high resolution ACS\nimaging to establish membership, with shortfalls at the\nboundaries between member and non-member population\nproperties, and in the high surface brightness regime. Construction of a luminosity function may be problematic if\ncEs and UCDs comprise significant cluster populations.\nHowever, we do not believe cEs to be a dominant population and it is still unclear as to whether UCDs are, in\nfact, galaxies at all rather than giant star clusters. We\nare following up on these two populations in Price et al.\n(2009) and Chiboucas et al. (in prep).\nOur results show that indirect and direct (spectroscopic)\nmeans for determining cluster membership have orthogo-\n\nnal biases. Spectroscopy is most successful for high surface brightness objects, the exact region where the indirect\nmeans tend to fail. Observations for high surface brightness objects require much shorter exposure times so larger\nsamples of high surface brightness galaxies may be observed in order to establish membership, while indirect\nmeans are expected to successfully identify LSB members.\nThis finding is significant as it suggests ways to maximize\nthe efficiency of telescope time for future cluster membership studies. With high spatial resolution imaging, indirect means provide a nearly 100% success rate for identifying low surface brightness members; spectroscopic studies should concentrate on intermediate and high surface\nbrightness galaxies.\nWe would like to thank the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions that have improved this paper.

Images are 18 arcsec across. The top row displays 4 examples of\ngalaxies considered definite members (ranking 1) due to the smooth low surface brightness appearance of the dE and dE,Ns. In the bottom\nrow are 4 galaxies considered to be very likely members (ranking 2). Although very probable dE and dE,N cluster members, these have a\nslightly patchier appearance.\n\nFig. 2.- Examples of galaxies assigned membership probability 3. Images are 18 arcsec across. This is the most ambiguous rating, and\nincludes galaxies that are considered possible member or background. In each case it is apparent why the galaxy is not clearly a background\ngalaxy or a cluster member. In panel (1), the object has low surface brightness, but is small and elongated, panels (2) and (3) show possible\ndistant spirals, and panel (4) is a compact high surface brightness object, either a more distant elliptical or a compact dwarf galaxy. Galaxies\nsuch as this one require spectroscopic confirmation of membership. In the bottom row, all are similar to dE and dE,N types, but are smaller\nthan other class 1 objects and have a patchier appearance.\n\n\f15\n\nFig. 3.- Examples of galaxies assigned membership probability 4. Images are 18 arcsec across. These galaxies are expected to lie in\nthe background, due to features that suggest late type morphologies and intrinsically high luminosities. The top row displays 4 cases of\nlow surface brightness galaxies expected to be late types at large distance. Identifying features include highly elliptical edge-on disks, spiral\nstructure, asymmetric profiles, and lumpy appearance. In the bottom row, these high surface brightness objects are believed to be late type\nfield galaxies, most exhibiting clear spiral and tidal structures.\n\nFig. 4.- Central region of the Coma Cluster with overlay showing all originally proposed ACS fields (highlighted yellow regions are\ncompleted ACS imaging) and the 4 LRIS mask regions. Green and red points represent spectroscopically determined member and background\ngalaxies from our membership determination sample. Blue circles and triangles are confirmed and questionable UCDs, while red and black\nXs represent UCD candidates which proved to be background galaxies and stars respectively.\n\n\f16\n\nChiboucas et al.\n\nFig. 5.- Spectra for 6 dE and dE,N, smoothed 3 times. From top to bottom, R\u2212band magnitudes range from 19.3 to 21.8.\n\n\f17\n\nFig. 6.- Measured member and background redshifts. These do not include the UCD sample redshifts.\n\n\f18\n\nChiboucas et al.\n\nFig. 7.- Galaxy velocity measurements compared to those also measured with Hectospec. The average difference is 32 km/s.\n\n\f19\n\nFig. 8.- Galaxies spectroscopically determined to be members which had been assigned membership probabilities 3-4 (possible members\nor likely background). The two membership assignments for each object are labeled. For object ID 242439, only one author supplied a\nmembership assignment. Images are 20 arcsec on a side.\n\nFig. 9.- Three galaxies with redshifts placing them outside of the Coma Cluster. Membership classifications based on morphology from\n2 authors are listed under the galaxy ID. None of these 3 galaxies were considered a definite background galaxy. Images are 20 arcsec on a\nside.\n\n\f20\n\nChiboucas et al.\n\nFig. 10.- Histogram of membership probability results. The shaded and open hatched histograms display confirmed member and\nbackground galaxy counts respectively as a function of average membership probability designation.\n\n\f21\n\nFig. 11.- Relative flux calibrated blue and red-side spectra of an unusually strong emission line object.\n\n\f22\n\nChiboucas et al.\n\nFig. 12.- Candidate UCD emission line object. Images are 15.5 arcsec across. Top: The F814W image with the target object (indicated\nby an arrow) centered in the slit. Another object lies just outside the slit to the west. The other galaxy further along this slit is also observed.\nBottom: The same section of the F475W image.\n\n\f23\n\nFig. 13.- Central surface brightness (mag arcsec\u22122 ) vs. R\u2212band magnitude. Small symbols represent candidate targets and associated\nsubjective membership probabilities as described in the key in the lower right. Symbols enclosing these denote the object type and membership\ndetermination for spectroscopically targeted objects (upper left key). Photometry comes from the catalog of Adami et al. (2006). Triangles\nrefer to questionable cases where redshift measurements are uncertain due to lower S/N spectra.\n\n\f24\n\nChiboucas et al.\n\nFig. 14.- Effective surface brightness (mag arcsec\u22122 ) vs. F 814W \u2212band magnitude.

The \u00b11\u03c3 error curves for the fit to brighter\ngalaxies, including the contribution from photometric measurement errors, are also shown.\n\n\f"}
