The corresponding expression (e.g., Eq. 6 in [9]) differs from Eq. 9 of [1] in\nthat the different tunneling processes in the detector are\nadded coherently, implying that proper \"unravelling\" of\nthe qubit dynamics in conditional approach should be\ndone as in [10,3], according to values of the detector current, not energy. This effectively assumes that there is no\ncoherence between states with different number of electrons passed through the detector. For eV \u223c \u03a9, it is impossible to write down the current operator in the qubit\nspace alone, since the qubit and detector dynamics cannot be separated. Perturbative treatment of the coupled\nqubit-detector dynamics [5] shows that, as expected, the\noscillation peak in spectral density exists for sufficiently\nlarge bias voltages eV > \u03a9.\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0404549v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 22 Apr 2004\n\nComment on \"Continuous quantum measurement: inelastic tunneling and lack of current oscillations\"\nRecent Letter [1] revisits the problem of continuous\nweak measurement of quantum coherent oscillations of\na qubit with a linear detector, the role of which is\nplayed by the quantum point contact (QPC) in the lowtransparency regime. Previous studies of this problem\n[2\u20135] demonstrated that the qubit oscillations with the\nRabi frequency \u03a9 should be reflected in the spectral density S(\u03c9) of the detector output (electron current in the\ncase of QPC detector) as a peak at frequency \u03c9 = \u03a9. An\ninteresting feature of such a peak [2] is that its height provides the measure of detector \"ideality\", i.e. shows how\nclose the detector is to being quantum-limited. For the\nquantum-limited detector the maximum peak can reach\nfour times the noise pedestal: S(\u03a9) \u2212 S0 \u2264 4S0 , where\nS0 is the output noise of the detector (current shot noise\nfor the QPC detector). This conclusion of Ref. [2] has\nbeen confirmed in [3\u20135]. Similar results have been also\nobtained for continuous measurement of a single spin precession [6,7]. Analogous spectral peak associated with\nthe Rabi oscillations of the continuously-monitored qubit\nhas been observed experimentally in [8].\nIn spite of all these developments, Letter [1] claims\nto show that there is no peak in the spectral density of\ncurrent in continuous qubit measurement by the QPC\ndetector. The purpose of this Comment is to emphasize\nthat this claim is incorrect, and to point out the error\nin the arguments of [1]. The error is rather simple and\nstems from incorrect use of the \"conditional\" description of the measurement process. Conditional approach\nallows one to simulate individual random outcomes of a\nquantum measurement and has several important advantages, providing, e.g., a simple description of the feedback control of quantum systems. However, it uses an\nassumption that quantum interference between different\npossible outcomes of measurement is suppressed, and\nmay lead to incorrect conclusions if the basis for which\nthe interference can be neglected is chosen incorrectly.\nMistake of this type was made in Letter [1] which assumes that the qubit interaction with the QPC detector\nsuppresses quantum interference between qubit energy\neigenstates. While these states indeed decohere on the\nlong time scales of order \u0393\u22121 , where \u0393 is the qubit decoherence rate due to the back-action noise of the detector,\ntheir coherence is preserved on the short time scales of\norder \u03a9\u22121 in the relevant case of weak interaction with\nthe detector, \u0393 \u226a \u03a9. The short-time quantum coherence\nbetween energy eigenstates is constantly being created by\nthe qubit-detector coupling that does not commute with\nthe qubit Hamiltonian. The fact that it is incorrectly\nneglected by assumption in [1] leads to wrong results for\nthe spectral density S(\u03c9) at \u03c9 \u2243 \u03a9.\nQuantitatively, the assumption of suppressed quantum\n\nDmitri V.
