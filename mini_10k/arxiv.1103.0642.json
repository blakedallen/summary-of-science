Disposal of plastic wastes has grown rapidly to a world problem so that\nincreasing environmental concerns have prompted researchers to investigate plastics recycling by\ndegradation as an alternative [2]. On the other hand, degradation of polymers in different environment is a major limiting factor in their application. Recently, with the advent of exploiting\nbiopolymers as functional materials [3, 4], the stability of such materials has become an issue of\nprimary concern.\nMost theoretical investigations of polymer degradation have focused so far on determining the\nrate of change of average molecular weight [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The main assumptions\n1\n\nTo whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail: milchev@mail.uni-mainz.de\n\n\fof the theory are that each link in a long chain molecule has equal strength and equal accessibility,\nthat they are broken at random, and that the probability of rupture is proportional to the number of\nlinks present. Experimental studies of polystyrene, however, have revealed discrepancies [6] with the\ntheory [5] so, for example, the thermal degradation stops completely or slows down markedly when a\ncertain chain length is reached. Only few theoretic studies [15, 16] have recently explored how does\nthe single polymer chain dynamics affect the resulting bond rupture probability. In both studies,\nhowever, for the sake of theoretical tractability one has worked with a model of a Gaussian chain\nbonded by linear (harmonic) forces whereby the anharmonic (non-linear) nature of the bonding\ninteractions was not taken into account. One could claim that the process of thermal degradation\nstill remains insufficiently studied and understood.\nMeanwhile, recently it was found experimentally [17, 18, 19] that covalent bonds may spontaneously break upon adsorption of brush-like macromolecules onto a substrate. One studied brushes\nconsisting of a poly(2-hydroxyethyl metacrylate) backbone and a poly(N-butyl acrylate) (PAB)\nside chains with degrees of polymerization L = 2150 \u00b1 100 and N = 140 \u00b1 5, and found spontaneous\nrupture of covalent bonds (which are otherwise hard to break) upon adsorption of these molecules\non mica, graphite, or water-propanol interfaces [17]. As the densely grafted side chains adsorb, they\nexperience steric repulsion due to monomer crowding which creates tension in the backbone. This\ntension, which depends on the grafting density, the side chain length, and the extent of substrate\nattraction, effectively lowers the energy barrier for dissociation, decreasing the bond life time [20].\nThus, one may observe amplification of bond tension from the pico-newton to nano-newton range\nwhich facilitates thermal degradation considerably.\nAlso recently, in several works Panyukov and collaborators [21, 22] predicted and theoretically\ndescribed the effect of tension amplification in branched macromolecules. They argued that the\nbrush-like architecture allows focusing of the side chain tension to the backbone whereby at given\ntemperature T the tension in the backbone becomes proportional to the length of the side chain,\nf \u2248 f0 N [21, 22]. The maximum tension in the side chains is f0 \u2248 kB T /b with kB -being the\nBoltzmann constant, and b - the Kuhn length (or, the monomer diameter for absolutely flexible\nchains).\n\n\fThe effect of adsorption-induced bond scission might have important implication for surface\nchemistry, in general, and for specific applications of new macro- and supramolecular materials, in\nparticular, for example, by steering the course of chemical reactions. One may use adsorption as a\nconvenient way to exceed the strength of covalent bonds and invoke irreversible fracture of macromolecules, holding the key to making molecular (DNA) architectures that undergo well-defined\nfragmentation upon adsorption.\nIn the present investigation we explore the process of chain fragmentation in desorbed and adsorbed bottle-brush macromolecules by means of a coarse-grained bead-spring model and Langevin\ndynamics. In Section 2 we describe briefly our model and then present our simulation results in\nSection 3. A summary of our results and conclusions is presented in Section 4. Anticipating, one\nmight claim that the reported results appear in good agreement with observations and theoretical\npredictions.\n\n2\n\nThe Model\n\nWe consider a 3d coarse-grained model of a polymer chain which consists of L repeatable units\n(monomers) connected by bonds, whereby each bond of length b is described by a Morse potential,\nUM (r) = D{1 \u2212 exp[\u2212\u03b1(r \u2212 b)}2\n\n(1)\n\nwith a parameter \u03b1 \u2261 1. The dissociation energy of such bonds is D, measured in units of kB T ,\nwhere kB denotes the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. The maximum restoring\nforce of the Morse potential, fmax = \u2212dUM /dr = \u03b1D/2, is reached at the inflection point, r =\nb + \u03b1\u22121 ln(2). This force fmax determines the tensile strength of the chain. Since the bond extension\nr \u2212 b between nearest-neighbor monomers along the polymer backbone in our 3d-model is always\npositive, the Morse potential Eq. (1) is only weakly repulsive and segments could partially penetrate\none another at r < b. Therefore, in order to allow properly for the excluded volume interactions\nbetween bonded monomers, we take the bond potential as a sum of UM (r) and the so called WeeksChandler-Anderson (WCA) potential, UW CA (r), (i.e., the shifted and truncated repulsive branch of\n\n\fthe Lennard-Jones potential);\n\u0014\u0010 \u0011\n\u0015\n\u03c3 12 \u0010 \u03c3 \u00116 1\nUW CA (r) = 4\u01eb\n\u0398(21/6 \u03c3 \u2212 r))\n\u2212\n+\nr\nr\n4\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u0398(x) = 0 or 1 for x < 0 or x \u2265 0, and \u01eb = 1. The non-bonded interactions between monomers\nare also taken into account by means of the WCA potential, Eq. (2). Thus the interactions in\nour model correspond to good solvent conditions. The length scale is set by the parameter \u03c3 = 1\nwhereby the monomer diameter b = 21/6 \u03c3 \u2248 1.12\u03c3.\nIn our MD simulation we use a Langevin equation, which describes the Brownian motion of a\nset of interacting particles whereby the action of the solvent is split into slowly evolving viscous\nforce and a rapidly fluctuating stochastic force:\n\u2192\n\u2212\ni\ni\n~i\nm v\u0307 i (t) = \u2212\u03b6~vi + F~M\n(t) + F~W\nCA (t) + R (t).\n\n(3)\n\nThe random force which represents the incessant collisions of the monomers with the solvent\nmolecules satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation theorem hR\u03b1i (t)R\u03b2j (t\u2032 )i = 2\u03b6kB T \u03b4ij \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). The\nfriction coefficient \u03b6 of the Langevin thermostat, used for equilibration, has been set at 0.25. The\np\nintegration step is 0.002 time units (t.u.) and time is measured in units of m/\u03c3 2 D where m\n\ndenotes the mass of the beads, m = 1. We emphasize at this point that in our coarse-grained\nmodeling no explicit solvent particles are included.\n\nFigure 1: A snapshot of a bottle-brush molecule (a \"centipede\") with L = 20 backbone monomers\n(blue) and 122 side chains (red) of length N = 4. Here kB T = 1 and strength of adsorption \u01ebs = 9.5.\nSide chains which are too strongly squeezed by the neighbors are seen occasionally to get off the\nsubstrate in order to minimize free energy.\n\nTwo side chains of length N are tethered to each repeatable unit of the backbone except for the\nterminal beads of the polymer backbone where a single side chains is anchored only. Thus the total\n\n\fnumber of monomers in the bottle-brush macromolecule is M = L + 2N(L + 1). Because of the\nhigh grafting density, we use rather short side chains N = 1 \u00f7 5 in our simulations - Fig. 1.\nFor the bonded interaction in the side chains we take the frequently used Kremer-Grest potential,\nUKG (r) = UW CA (r) + UF EN E (r), with the so-called 'finitely-extensible non-linear elastic' (FENE)\npotential,\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132 #\n1 2\nr\nUF EN E (r) = \u2212 kr0 ln 1 \u2212\n.\n2\nr0\n\n(4)\n\nIn Eq. (4) k = 30, r0 = 1.5, so that the total potential UKG (r) has a minimum at bond length\nrbond \u2248 0.96. Thus, the bonded interaction, UKG (r), makes the bonds of the side chains in our\nmodel unbreakable whereas those of the backbone may and do undergo scission.\nThe substrate in the present study is considered simply as a structureless adsorbing plane,\nwith a Lennard-Jones potential acting with strength \u01ebs in the perpendicular z\u2212direction. In our\nsimulations we consider as a rule the case of strong adsorption, \u01ebs /kB T = 5.0 \u00f7 10.0.\nWe start the simulation with a well equilibrated conformation of the chain and examine the\nthermal scission of the bonds. We measure the mean life time \u03c4 until the first bond rupture occurs,\nand average these times over more than 2 \u00d7 104 events so as to determine the mean h\u03c4 i which\nis also referred to as Mean First Breakage Time (MFBT). In the course of the simulation we also\nsample the probability distribution of bond breaking regarding their position in the chain (a rupture\nprobability histogram), the probability distribution of the First Breakage Time, \u03c4 , as well as other\nquantities of interest. At periodic intervals we analyze the length distribution of backbone fragments\nand establish the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of fragment sizes, P (n, t), which also\nyields the time evolution of the mean fragment length L(t).\nSince in the problem of thermal degradation there is no external force acting on the chain ends,\na well defined activation barrier for a bond scission is actually missing, in contrast to the case\nof applied tensile force. Therefore, a definition of an unambiguous criterion for bond breakage\nis not self-evident. Moreover, depending on the degree of stretching, bonds may break and then\nrecombine again. Therefore, in our numeric experiments we use a sufficiently large expansion of the\nbond, rh = 2b, as a threshold to a broken state of the bond. This convention is based on our checks\nthat the probability for recombination of bonds, stretched beyond rh , is sufficiently small.\n\n\f3\n\nSimulation Results\n\n3.1\n\nEquilibrium Properties\n\nWe have checked typical properties of the strongly adsorbed brush molecules as the variation of\nthe mean radius of gyration Rg2 and the mean end-to-end distance between terminal points on the\npolymer backbone, Re2 , for several lengths of the side chains, N - see Fig. 2a. One can easily verify\nfrom Fig. 2a, that the structure of the bottle-brush indicates a typical quasi-2d behavior, as one\nwould expect for the case of strong adsorption.

The same applies for the mean bond length b2\nbetween segments along the backbone as function of N. Evidently, due to the high grafting density\nthe side chains repel and stretch each other into an extended conformation. The steric repulsion\nbetween side chains is strongly enhanced when the macromolecule is adsorbed and attains a quasitwodimensional conformation. As a result, both its contour and persistent lengths are increased.\n\n\f3.2\n\nScission Probability Histogram\n\nWe examine the distribution of scission probability (the probability of bond rupture) along the\npolymer backbone for the case of a strong adsorption, T = 0.10, \u01ebs = 0.5 in Fig. 3. One can readily\nverify from Fig. 3a that for a given contour length L the shape of the probability histogram changes\nqualitatively as the length of side chains N is increased beyond one, N > 1.

(b) Variation of the scission probability histogram with contour length\nL for brush molecules with fixed side chain length N = 2.\n\nthe scission probability is uniformly distributed along the backbone (being significantly diminished\nonly in the vicinity of both terminal bonds), for N > 1, in contrast, one observes a well expressed\nminimum in the probability in the middle of the chain in between the two pronounced maxima\n(\"horns\") close to the chain ends. This effect persists and is even enhanced as the contour length L\ngets larger - Fig. 3b. Occasionally, some additional maxima show up in longer molecules, L > 30,\nwhich are then found to disappear with improved statistics. We have tracked down these temporal\nmaxima in the scission probabilities as corresponding to local bends and kinks in the contour which,\nowing to mutual squeezing or rarefaction, strongly change the side chains mobility and, presumably,\nthe induced tension. Since conformations of adsorbed long molecules change rather slowly, a very\nlarge number of simulation runs is needed before such spurious maxima disappear.\nEvidently, with growing length N of the side chains the minimum gets deeper and broader,\n\n\findicating that breakage happens most frequently in bonds which are very close to the terminal\nbonds of the backbone. Given the high density of grafting, one may interpret this effect as a\nconsequence of the mutual immobilization and blocking of the side chains which are placed in the\nmiddle. In comparison, side chains that are closer to the ends of the polymer backbone still have\nsufficient freedom to move and, therefore, contribute locally to stronger tension in the vicinity of\nboth ends of the backbone. Side chains of length N = 1, on the other hand, are too short to block\none another. Therefore brush molecules with N = 1 behave similar to such with longer side chains\nbut at sufficiently lower grafting density.\n\n3.3\n\nDependence of h\u03c4 i on L\n\nIn Fig. 4a we show the dependence of the mean time before any of the backbone bonds breaks, i.e.,\nthe MFBT h\u03c4 i on the contour length L and on the total number of segments in the bottle-brush\nmolecule M = L + 2N(L + 1). Evidently, one observes a well expressed power law, h\u03c4 i \u221d L\u2212\u03b1 with\nexponent \u03b1 \u2248 0.17. Since for large L one has M \u221d L, the variation of h\u03c4 i with M is the same.

Here kB T = 0.10. (b) Mean\nlife time h\u03c4 i vs N for a desorbed (free) and adsorbed brush molecule with L = 30.\n\nfinding is important because it indicates that h\u03c4 i depends rather weakly on the total number of\nbonds that might break, in clear contrast to thermal degradation of polymers without side chains\n[23] where \u03b1 = 1. Indeed, when bonds break uncorrelated and entirely at random, the probability\nthat any of the L bonds may undergo scission within a certain time interval should be proportional\n\n\fto the total number of bonds, and therefore h\u03c4 i \u221d 1/L. In cases of chain scission when a constant\nexternal force pulls at the ends of the polymer, however, one finds typically \u03b1 < 1 [24] whereby\nthe value of \u03b1 steadily decreases as the force strength grows. This suggests a gradual crossover\nfrom a predominantly individual to a more concerted mechanism of bond scission. In adsorbed\nbottle-brush molecules it is the side chains that induce tension in the polymer backbone and thus\nlead to rupture behavior similar to that with external force.\nIn Fig. 4b we compare the dependence of h\u03c4 i on length N of the side chains, comparing nonadsorbed (free) and adsorbed brush molecules of length L = 30. As far as the side chains are rather\nshort, one should not overestimate the observed power-law dependence, with h\u03c4 i \u221d N \u22121.25 for free,\nand h\u03c4 i \u221d N \u22120.53 for strongly adsorbed molecules. Generally, adsorption is found to diminish the\nmean rupture time by more than an order of magnitude alone, at least for N > 1. As mentioned\nbefore, the case N = 1 where neighboring side chains almost do not overlap is qualitatively different\nso, upon adsorption, the MFBT shortens by a factor of three only.\n\n3.4\n\nFragment Size Distribution\n\nIn the present work we studied the fragmentation kinetics and the resulting molecular weight distribution, P (n, t), of strongly adsorbed bottle-brush molecules for the shortest side chains N = 1,\n- see Fig. 5 - since, as shown above, they do not mutually overlap very strongly and produce a\nscission probability distribution for the bonds along the polymer backbone that matches the one,\ninferred from experiment [17]. If one assumes that the scission kinetics is described by a first-order\nreaction, then one may describe the decrease in the average contour length of the fragments with\nelapsed time [18, 19] as\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\nL(t) L\u221e\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\nL0 L\u221e\n\n\u0013\n\ne\u2212kt ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere L0 is the initial contour length at t = 0 and L\u221e is the mean contour length of polymer\nchains at infinite time. The lower limit of the chain length of fractured molecules is ascribed to\nreduction of the backbone tension as molecular brushes with short backbones adopt a more relaxed\nconformation. In Fig. 6a we show the length distributions of the degradation products at different\ntimes after the onset of the scission process. The shapes of P (n, t) are found to agree well with\nthe experimentally observed ones [18] even though our species are about an order of magnitude\n\n\fFigure 5: Snapshots of an adsorbed bottle-brush macromolecule (a \"centipede\") with backbone\nlength L = 100 and side length N = 1 at T = 0.12 and \u01ebs = 0.50 before (above) and after (below)\nthe fragmentation process is completed at t = 600 t.u.\n\nsmaller than in the laboratory experiment, and the side chains - even more. In the beginning of the\ndegradation, t = 0.2\u00f70.4, one can still observe a \u03b4\u2212function-like peak at the initial length L0 = 100\nof the backbone. At later times t \u2265 0.4, the distribution goes over into a rather flat one with a\nmaximum around size n \u2248 10. Eventually, one ends up with a rather sharply peaked P (n, t = 29) at\nsizes n \u2248 1 \u00f7 4 which yields L\u221e (t \u226b 1) \u2248 7.5 at late times. Bonds in brush molecules of size n = 7\nand shorter remain resistant to cleavage over very long periods of time. Following the theoretical\nconsideration by Panyukov et al. [21], one would conclude that the maximum tension along the\nbrush backbone, f \u2248\n\nkB T\nb\n\nL\u221e has fallen below the threshold necessary for rupture.\n\nThe variation of the mean fragment size L(t) appears to be qualitatively well described by the\ntheoretical expression, Eq. (5), apart from some small deviations at the crossover between initial\nfast fragmentation and a very slow subsequent decline of L(t) - Fig. 6b. Our data suggest a value\nfor the rate constant k = 0.25.\nThus the simulation data, presented in Fig. 6, appear to support the basic assumption that\nleads to Eq. (5), namely that every bond scission results in a new molecule. One may therefore\nconclude that recombination of bonds during the degradation process plays a negligible role under\n\n\f100\n\n(b)\n80\n\nL(t)\nL(t)=L\u221e/[1+e\n\nL(t)\n\n60\n\n-0.25t\n\n(L\u221e/L0-1)]\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nTime t [x 20 t.u.]\n\nFigure 6: (a) Probability distribution of fragment sizes P (n, t) at different times t (in units of\n20 MD t.u.) after beginning of the fragmentation process for a brush molecule on a substrate\nwith L = 100, N = 1.

In this work we have used a MD simulation to model the process of thermal degradation in\nstrongly adsorbed bottle-brush molecules. Our results confirm the strong effect of adsorption on\nchain scission, owing to an enormous increase in backbone tension, predicted theoretically [21].\nThis has been indeed observed in recent experiments [17, 18, 19]. Since the chemical nature of the\nbonding interactions remains unchanged, the observed adsorption-induced bond cleavage is of purely\nmechanical origin and is due to the conformational changes which a branched molecule undergoes\nwhen the energy gain by contact with the surface confines the molecule in a quasi-2d shape.\nAmong the main results of our investigation one should note\n\u2022 static (Rg2 , Re2 ) and dynamics (diffusion coefficient D) properties of strongly adsorbed bottlebrush molecules on a substrate reveal a typical behavior of quasi-2d objects with scaling\nexponent \u03bd = 3/4.\n\u2022 The mean life time of a bond h\u03c4 i becomes more than an order of magnitude shorter upon\n\n\fadsorption of a free bottle brush molecules on adhesive surface\n\u2022 The mean life time h\u03c4 i decreases weakly with growing contour length L of the backbone,\nh\u03c4 i \u221d L\u22120.17 , and faster, h\u03c4 i \u221d N \u22120.53 with the length of the side chains, N.\n\u2022 The probability distribution for rupture is sensitive to the grafting density of the side chains\n- the shape of the scission probability distribution resembles the experimentally established\none only at lower grafting density when the side chains do not overlap strongly.\n\u2022 The length distribution P (n, t) and the average length of fragments, L(t), during the degradation process are found to agree well with the respective ones, observed in experiments. Our\ndata confirm the basic assumption for the scission kinetics as a first order chemical reaction.\nGenerally, one may therefore conclude that our model provides an adequate description of the\nbehavior of bottle-brush molecules during fragmentation. Of course, many aspects of the adsorptioninduced thermal degradation may and should be explored in much more detail than in the present\nstudy. We plan to report on such investigations in a future work.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nOne of us, A.
