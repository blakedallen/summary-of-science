Introduction\nIn recent years the extragalactic X\u2013ray background in the 0.1-10 keV band has almost completely been resolved into discrete sources with\nthe deepest ROSAT, Chandra and XMM-Newton\nobservations [1,2,3,4]. Optical identification programmes with Keck [5,6,7,8]) and VLT [9,10]\nfind predominantly unobscured AGN-1 at X-ray\nfluxes SX > 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, and a mixture of unobscured and obscured AGN-2 at fluxes\n10\u221214 > SX > 10\u221215.5 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 with ever\nfainter and redder optical counterparts, while at\neven lower X-ray fluxes a new population of star\nforming galaxies emerges [11,12]. At optical magnitudes R>24 all these surveys suffer, however,\nfrom spectroscopic incompleteness, so that photometric redshift techniques have to be applied\nhere [13].\nAfter having understood the basic contributions to the X-ray background, the interest is\nnow focusing on understanding the physical nature of these sources, the cosmological evolution\nof their properties, and their role in models of\ngalaxy evolution. The X-ray observations have\nbeen roughly consistent with X-ray background\n\npopulation synthesis assuming a mixture of absorbed and unabsorbed AGN, folded with the corresponding luminosity function and cosmological\nevolution, e.g.[14,15,16]. However, inputs to these\nmodels are still rather uncertain, like e.g. the cosmological evolution of low-luminosity AGN or the\nfraction of type-1 to type-2 AGN as a function\nof redshift and intrinsic luminosity, and a wide\nrange of different assumptions has been invoked\nfor these parameters [17,18], see also [19]. Finally,\nthe source statistics and optical incompleteness\nare rather poor at high redhifts.\nThe deep Chandra and XMM surveys, but also\nwider ASCA surveys have already provided important new constraints. Several examples of\nthe long-sought class of high redshift, radio quiet\ntype-2 QSO have been detected in deep fields\n[20,21,8,9]. These allow for the first time to constrain the fraction of type-2 AGN as a function\nof X\u2013ray luminosity. At low luminosities a type-2\nfraction of 75-80% is found, consistent with local optically selected Seyfert galaxies, while at\nhigh luminosities the type-2 fraction is significantly smaller [22,9]. The redshift distribution\nof Chandra deep survey sources peaks at z\u22480.7.\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 1. Color composite image of the \u223c800 ksec XMM-Newton image of the Lockman Hole. The image was\nobtained combining three energy bands: 0.5-2 keV, 2-4.5 keV, 4.5-10 keV (respectively red, green and blue),\nfollowing [3]. The image has a size of \u223c43\u00d730 arcmin2 .\n\nThis is related to the finding of a much slower\ncosmic evolution for Seyferts compared to QSOs\n[22,23,24,25,10]. And finally, significant spikes are\nfound in the redshift distributions [26,27], indicating that AGN prefer to live in sheets of large-scale\nstructure.\nIn this review I show preliminary results on an\nultradeep XMM-Newton observation in the Lockman Hole and compare the optical identification\nwork in the two deepest Chandra fields, the Chandra Deep Field South and the Hubble Deep Field\nNorth.\n\n2. XMM-Newton Ultradeep Survey of the\nLockman Hole\nThe Lockman Hole (LH) is the area with the\nabsolutely lowest column density of interstellar\nabsorption and was selected for the location of\nthe deepest ROSAT surveys [1], as well as the\nfirst XMM-Newton deep survey, observed in the\nperformance verification phase of the satellite [3].\nIn AO2 a 200 ksec observation of the LH was\nawarded to X. Barcons, but due to high background conditions, unfortunately only about 50\nksec of good exposure time could be secured. In\nAO3, our XMM LH team, including X. Barcons\nand A. Fabian, has been awarded an XMM exposure time of 665 ksec in the Lockman Hole. Due\n\n\f3\nto a scheduling error, the step width of the mini\nraster survey specified in order to reduce the imprint of the CCD chip gaps on the exposure map,\nhas been set erroneously to 15 arcminutes instead\nof 1 arcmin, so that a significant part of the exposure (> 300 ksec net) was spent in a wider raster\npattern. While unfortunate for the primary goal\nof our deep survey, this turned out to be very\nuseful, because it provided a wider area coverage\nwith an exposure time of almost 100 ksec. Finally, the XMM-Newton observatory reimbursed\nthe 300 ksec exposure lost for the central pointing,\nso that the total net integrated XMM-Newton exposure in the Lockman Hole is about 800 ksec (see\nFigure 1).\nFigure 1 shows the colour composite XMMNewton image of the Lockman Hole. North is\nup and East is to the left. This was constructed\nby combining images, smoothed with a Gaussian\nwith \u03c3=2\" in three bands (0.5-2 keV, 2-4.5 keV,\n4.5-10 keV). Blue sources are those undetected\nin the soft (0.5-2 keV) band, most likely due to\nintrinsic absorption from neutral hydrogen with\ncolumn densities NH > 1022 cm\u22122 . Very soft\nsources appear red.\n2.1. X-ray spectroscopy\nThe large throughput and the unprecedented\nhard X-ray sensitivity of the telescopes aboard\nthe XMM-Newton observatory allow for the first\ntime to determine X-ray spectra of the faintest\nX-ray source population and constrain the evolution of their physical properties, in particular\nthe X-ray absorption. In the first deep survey\ntaken with XMM-Newton in the Lockman Hole,\nit was possible to determine coarse X-ray spectra of about 50 X-ray sources with more than 100\nphotons detected in the XMM observation, representing a largely complete, optically identified\nsubsample [28]. While type-1 QSOs have the typical blue colours, type-2 sources follow much redder optical colour tracks expected for their host\ngalaxy because the optical nucleus is obscured.\nX-ray spectrophotometry with XMM finds the expected strong correlation between X-ray absorption and optical obscuration [28]. However, there\nare two high redshift type-1 QSOs which are optically unobscured and X-ray absorbed, indicating\n\npossible differences in the dust properties of these\nsources, e.g. [29]. However, the existing samples\nare too small to make population studies. A 400\nksec XMM-Newton observation of the Chandra\nDeep Field South (see below) is providing additional X-ray spectroscopy samples [30]. In the\nnew 800 ksec XMM observation 330 sources have\nmore than 200 counts and 104 have > 1000 counts\nallowing to study emission and absorption properties of rather distant sources in great detail. The\nspectral diagnostics of high-redshift is in particular helped by the extremely low neutral hydrogen\ncolumn density towards the LH.\nFigure 2 shows examples of unfolded X-ray\nspectra from three sources in the 800 ksec observation of the LH, combining the data from the\ntwo MOS CCD and the pn-CCD camera of XMMNewton. Panel 2a shows the spectrum of ROSAT\nDeep Survey (RDS) source #32A, a type-1 QSO\nat z=1.117, which can be fit to first order by a single power law model with photon index 2.18\u00b10.02\nand galactic absorption. A detailed look at the\nresiduals of this fit, however, reveals excesses at\nsoft energies (below 0.8 keV in the QSO restframe), which could be associated with a soft\nexcess. At high energies (above 8 keV in the\nQSO rest frame) there seems to be an excess,\nwhich is likely associated to Compton reflection.\nNo strong Fe line is apparent in this spectrum.\nPanel 2b shows the spectrum of ROSAT Ultradeep Survey (UDS) source #901A, a relatively\nnearby Seyfert-2 galaxy at z=0.204. Its X-ray\nspectrum can be fit with a heavily obscured power\nlaw with NH = 40 \u00b1 5 * 1022 cm\u22122 and photon\nindex \u223c 1.9 and a superposed, broad Fe emission\nline, plus an additional unabsorbed soft thermal\nspectrum with a temperature of 0.60 \u00b1 0.06 keV,\nwhich, however does not show any emission lines.\nThe spectrum of RDS source #12A, a Seyfert-2\ngalaxy at z=0.99, is shown in panels 2c and 2d. It\ncan be fit either with two heavily absorbed power\nlaw spectra with a 'standard' photon index \u223c 2\nand two absorber thicknesses of NH = 2.3 * 1022\nand 2.6*1023 cm\u22122 . This can be either interpreted\n(2c) as one AGN with partial covering absorption\nwith a covering factor of roughly 80%, or even as\na pair of AGN in the same galaxy, similar to the\ncase recently discoverd in NGC 6240 [31]. Alter-\n\n\f4\n# 32A\n\na\n\nc\n\n# 901A\n\nb\n\n#12 A\n\nd\n\n#12A\n\nFigure 2. Selected X-ray spectra from the XMM-Newton observation of the Lockman Hole. (a) ROSAT #32A\nfit by a single power law without intrinsic absorption; (b) ROSAT #901A fit by a soft thermal component plus a\nheavily absorbed power law with superposed, broad Fe emission line; (c) ROSAT #12A fit with a power law with\ntwo intrinsic absorber thicknesses; (d) ROSAT #12A fit with an intrinsically absorbed power law and a broad Fe\nemission line.\n\nnatively it can be interpreted (2d) as a single, intrinsically absorbed power law with a rather flat\nphoton index \u223c 1.3 and a superposed broad Fe\nemission line.\n2.2. Time variability\nOne possibility to distinguish between different spectral model interpretations is to study\nthe temporal variability of these very faint Xray sources. The Lockman Hole is ideally suited\nfor this purpose, because it has been a deep Survey reference field for every imaging X-ray satellite following ROSAT, i.e. ASCA, BeppoSAX,\nChandra, and finally XMM-Newton, covering a\n\ntime base of about 13 years [32,33,34,3]. Figure\n3 shows the light curves for two of the sources\nfor which spectra are presented in Figure 2, the\nSeyfert-2 galaxy ROSAT #12A and the QSO\n#32A. The black points with error bars (almost\ninvisible for #32A) give the 0.5-2 keV flux as\na function of time, based on ROSAT PSPC,\nROSAT HRI, Chandra HRC and XMM-Newton\nEPIC data. It is surprising to see, that both the\nabsorbed and the unabsorbed AGN show longterm time variations of up to a factor of five. The\nred data points connected with dashed lines show\nthe corresponding 2-10 keV flux (based only on\nXMM-Newton) for both sources, which varies sig-\n\n\f5\n\n3\n\nChandra\n\n1\nROSAT\n\nXMM-Newton\n\n49000\n\n50000\n\nChandra\n\nROSAT\n\nXMM-Newton\n\nROSAT #32 (z=1.17)\n\nROSAT #12 (z=0.99)\n\n48000\n\n10\n\n-14\n\ncgs)\n\n0.5-2 keV\n2-10 keV\n\n0.5-2 keV Flux (10\n\n0.5-2 keV Flux (10\n\n-14\n\ncgs)\n\n2-10 keV\n\n2\n\n51000\n\n52000\n\n53000\n\nMJD (day)\n\n1\n48000\n\n49000\n\n50000\n\n51000\n\n52000\n\n53000\n\nMJD (day)\n\nFigure 3. Long-term X-ray light curves of ROSAT #12A (a) and ROSAT #32A (b) measured with several\ndifferent satellites and instruments. The first eight data points are taken from the ROSAT deep PSPC and\nultradeep HRI observations of the Lockman Hole [1]. The next three data points are from the Chandra HRC\nobservations of the Lockman Hole (PI: S. Murray). The last four data points are from XMM-Newton ([3] and this\nwork). Count rates have been converted to 0.5-2 keV fluxes assuming the spectral models shown in Figure 2. The\nshort dashed line of data points with star symbols gives the corresponding 2-10 keV fluxes from XMM-Newton.\n\nnificantly hand in hand with the soft X-ray flux.\nThe second XMM-Newton data point of #12A,\nhowever, seems to deviate from this correspondence, which may indeed indicate that we are\nseeing two separate components varying independently. It would definitely be interesting to further monitor this source and to look for other,\nsimilar examples of spectral and timing complexity.\nThe Lockman Hole contains a double-lobed\nhigh-redshift cluster of galaxies (see Figure 1 in\nthe North-East of the image) which was expected\nto lie around a redshift of 1.26 [35]. The new\nXMM-Newton data now allowed for the first time\nto determine an X-ray redshift of z=1.13 from the\nFe K\u03b1 line of both lobes of the cluster. This is\nsignificantly different from the original redshift,\nwhich was based on a Keck NIR spectrum of a\nsingle central galaxy [36], but has later been confirmed by Keck spectroscopy of two fainter cluster galaxies. The XMM-Newton data can also\nconstrain the chemical abundances of the intergalactic medium of the cluster, for the first time\nat such a high redshift and rather low luminosity\n[37].\n\nWith the new XMM catalogue in the Lockman\nHole we already have been awarded one night of\nspectroscopy with the powerful DEIMOS widefield spectrograph, in cooperation with P. Henry\n(IfA). The observations were taken in March 2003\nand reduced by I. Lehmann (MPE). A total of\nmore than 100 spectra could be secured. However, due to the extremely faint optical counterparts only 25 new redshift identifications were obtained, raising the number of identified sources\nto about 135 in the LH. Further spectroscopy at\n4-10m class telescopes is necessary to complete\nthe optical spectroscopy in the Lockman Hole.\nHowever, for statistical studies a sample, which\nis rather complete for 0.5-2 keV fluxes down to\n10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 can be defined currently.\n3. The deepest Chandra Fields\nThe Chandra X-ray Observatory has performed\ndeep X-ray surveys in a number of fields with\never increasing exposure times [38,11,2,21] and\nhas completed a 1 Msec exposure in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) [12] and a 2 Msec\nexposure in the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-\n\n\f6\nN) [4].\nThe CDF-S was also observed with XMMNewton for a net exposure of 400 ksec in July\n2001 and January 2002 (PI: J. Bergeron, see\n[39]). The EPIC cameras have a larger field-ofview than ACIS, and a number of new diffuse\nsources are detected just outside the Chandra image. Similar to the LH, X-ray spectroscopy of a\nlarge number of sources will ultimately be very\npowerful with XMM-Newton [30].\n3.1. VLT optical spectroscopy\nOptical spectroscopy in the CDF-S has been\ncarried out in 11 nights with the ESO Very\nLarge Telescope (VLT) in the time frame April\n2000 - December 2001, using deep optical imaging\nand low resolution multiobject spectroscopy with\nthe FORS instruments with individual exposure\ntimes ranging from 1-5 hours. Some preliminary\nresults including the VLT optical spectroscopy\nhave already been presented [20,12]. The complete optical spectroscopy is published in [9].\nRedshifts could be obtained so far for 169 of the\n346 sources in the CDF-S, of which 144 are very\nreliable (high quality spectra with 2 or more spectral features), while the remaining optical spectra contain only a single emission line, or are of\nlower S/N. For objects fainter than R=24 reliable\nredshifts can be obtained if the spectra contain\nstrong emission lines. For the remaining optically\nfaint objects, and those not covered by the multiobject spectroscopy, we have to resort to photometric redshift techniques [40,41,13]. For a subsample at off-axis angles smaller than 10 arcmin\nwe obtain a spectroscopic completeness of about\n50%. Including photometric redshifts this completeness increases to \u2248 96%.\n3.2. X-ray/optical classification\nFollowing [12,39] we show in Figure 4 left the\nhardness ratio as a function of the luminosity in\nthe 0.5-10 keV band for 169 sources for which we\nhave optical spectra and rather secure classification in the CDF-S [9] (large symbols) and about\n170 objects with photometric redshifts [13] (small\nsymbols). The X-ray luminosities are not corrected for internal absorption and are computed\nin a 'consensus cosmology' with H0 = 70 km s\u22121\n\nMpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. Different source\ntypes are clearly segregated in this plane. Type-1\nAGNs (black diamonds) have luminosities typically above 1042 erg s\u22121 , with hardness ratios in a\nnarrow range around HR\u2248-0.5. Type-2 AGN are\nskewed towards significantly higher hardness ratios (HR>0), with (absorbed) luminosities in the\nrange 1041\u221244 erg s\u22121 . Direct spectral fits of the\nXMM-Newton and Chandra spectra clearly indicate that these harder spectra are due to neutral\ngas absorption and not due to a flatter intrinsic\nslope (see [28,42]). Therefore the unabsorbed, intrinsic luminosities of type-2 AGN would fall in\nthe same range as those of type-1's.\nIn Figure 4 we also indicate the type-2 QSOs\n(asterisks), the first one of which was discovered\nin the CDF-S [20]. In the meantime, more examples have been found in the CDF-S and elsewhere [21]. It is interesting to note that no highluminosity, very hard sources exist in this diagram. This is a selection effect of the pencil beam\nsurveys: due to the small solid angle, the rare\nhigh luminosity sources are only sampled at high\nredshifts, where the absorption cut-off of type-2\nAGN is redshifted to softer X-ray energies. Indeed, the type-2 QSOs in this sample are the objects at LX > 1044 erg s\u22121 and HR>-0.2. The\ntype-1 QSO in this region of the diagram is a\nBAL QSO with significant intrinsic absorption.\nAbout 10% of the objects have optical spectra of normal galaxies (marked with triangles),\nluminosities below 1042 erg s\u22121 and very soft Xray spectra (several with HR=-1), as expected in\nthe case of starbursts or thermal halos. In these\ngalaxies the X-ray emission is likely due to a mixture of hot, thermal gas and a population of low\nmass X-ray binaries [7], plus possibly some low\nlevel AGN activity [43]. Therefore the deep Chandra and XMM-Newton surveys detect for the first\ntime the population of normal starburst galaxies out to intermediate redshifts [38,2,34]. These\ngalaxies might become an important means to\nstudy the star formation history in the universe\ncompletely independently from optical/UV, submm or radio observations [43].\nFigure 4 (right) shows the same diagram for the\nspectroscopic and photometric identifications in\nthe 1Msec catalogue of the HDF-N [27,8]. While\n\n\f7\n\nCDF\u2212S\n\nHDF\u2212N\n\nFigure 4. Hardness ratio versus rest frame luminosity in the total (0.5-10 keV) band. Objects are coloured\naccording to their X-ray/optical classification: filled black diamonds correspond to low-luminosity type-1 AGN\n(log(LX ) < 44 erg s\u22121 ), filled black squares to type-1 QSOs (log(LX ) > 44 erg s\u22121 ), open red circles to lowluminosity type-2 AGN (log(LX ) < 44 erg s\u22121 ), large red asterisks indicate type-2 QSOs (log(LX ) > 44 erg\ns\u22121 ), green triangles galaxies and blue squares extended X-ray sources. A consensus cosmology with H0 = 70\nkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 has been adopted. Luminosities are not corrected for possible intrinsic\nabsorption.\n\nthe authors give only purely optical classification\ninformation for the X-ray counterparts (basically\n\"galaxy\" or \"broad line object\"), we have applied\nthe above X-ray/optical classification scheme also\nto their catalogue. The corresponding diagram\nshows basically the same features: the X-rays\nshow that type-1 (mainly broad-line) AGN cluster around HR\u2248-0.5 and break the degeneracy\nbetween type-2 Seyferts and normal galaxies.\nThe CDF-S identification catalogue [9] includes\n8 type-2 QSOs at redshifts above 2 (see figure\n3 left), which all are characterised by strong\nand narrow UV emission lines (Lyman-\u03b1, CIV\netc.) with almost absent continuum. Additionally, there are three objects with photometric redshifts, luminosities and hardness ratios consistent\nwith type-2 QSOs., The corresponding HDF-N\ncatalogue [27] lists only two possible type-2 QSOs\nat such high redshifts and one additional photometric candidate [8]. A closer look at Figure 5\nand the optical magnitudes of the CDF-S type-2\nQSO shows that these objects are predominantly\n\ndetected at optical magnitudes R> 24. One reason for the relative absence of this population in\nthe HDF-N could be that a smaller number of\nidentifications at R> 24 exist in this survey compared to the CDF-S. However, a true field to field\nvariation (cosmic variance) or statistical fluctuation cannot be ruled out.\n4. Redshift and luminosity distributions\nfor different AGN types\nThe current spectroscopic/photometric completeness of the CDF-S and HDF-N identifications allows to compare the observed redshift\ndistribution with predictions from X\u2013ray background population synthesis models, which, due\nto the saturation of the QSO evolution predict\na maximum at redshifts around z=1.5. Figure 6\nshows two predictions of the redshift distribution\nfrom the Gilli et al. model [16] for a flux limit of\n2.3 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 0.5-2 keV band\nwith different assumptions for the high-redshift\n\n\f8\n\nCDF\u2212S\n\nHDF\u2212N\n\nFigure 5. X-ray luminosity versus redshift magnitude for the CDF-S-sources (left) and the HDF-N sources (right).\nSymbols are the same as in Figure 4.\n\nevolution of the QSO space density. The model\ncurves have been normalized to fit the observed\ndistribution in the redshift range 2-2.4.\nThe actually observed redshift distribution of\nAGN selected from the HDF-N and CDF-S Chandra deep survey samples at off-axis angles below\n10 arcmin and in the 0.5-2 keV band is shown in\nFig. 5 (left) as histogram and data points (solid\ncircles). In the redshift range below 1.5 it is radically different from the prediction, with a peak\nat redshift z\u22480.7. This low redshift peak is dominated by Seyfert galaxies with X-ray luminosities\nin the range LX = 1042\u221244 erg s\u22121 . This figure\nalso shows, that the redshift distributions separated into type-1 AGN (crosses) and type-2 AGN\n(crosses with open circles) both peak significantly\nbelow z=1, which is not consistent with some recent population models, where the low redshift\npeak was assumed to be mainly in the type-2\nAGN population [17,18].\nSince the peak in the observed redshift distribution is expected at the redshift, where the\nstrong positive evolution of AGN terminates, we\ncan conclude that the evolution of Seyfert galaxies is significantly different from that of QSOs,\nwith their evolution saturating around a redshift\n\nof 0.7, compared to the much earlier evolution of\nQSOs which saturates at z\u22481.5 [46]. The statistics of the two samples is now sufficient to rule\nout the constant space density model at redshifts\nabove 3, clearly indicating a decline of the X-ray\nselected QSO population at high redshift consistent with the optical findings.\nFigure 6 (right) shows the ratio of type-2 AGN\nto all AGN selected in the 2-10 keV band for both\nthe CDF-S and HDF-N (spectroscopic as well as\nphotometric redshifts) as a function of the 2-10\nkeV luminosity. As already indicated by Ueda et\nal. [22] and confirmed by Szokoly et al. [9] there\nis a strong dependence of the fraction of type-2\nAGN, i.e. the ratio of type-2 over all AGN as a\nfunction of luminosity. While the type-2 fraction\nat low luminosities is consistent with the local\nratio of optically selected Seyfert galaxies [47] of\nabout 4:5, at high luminosities the ratio is 1:3.\nThis indicates a breakdown of the 'strong unification' model, where the covering factor is independent of luminosity and redshift. A possible\nexplanation of this trend may be, that high luminosity objects are able to 'clean out' their environment by ionizing the circumnuclear matter\nand/or producing strong outflows, while low lu-\n\n\f9\nChandra+XMM Deep Survey AGN (0.5-2 keV)\n100\n\n1.0\n\nCDFS+HDFN\n\n0.9\n\nUeda et al. 2003\n\n0.7\n\nType 2 fraction\n\nNumber of AGN\n\n0.8\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n42\n\nRedshift\n\n43\n\nL\nX\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n-1\n(erg s\n) 2-10 keV\n\nFigure 6.

The dashed line shows the prediction for a model, where the\ncomoving space density of high-redshift QSO follows the decline above z=2.7 observed in optical samples [44,45].\nThe dotted line shows a prediction with a constant space density for z > 1.5. The two model curves have been\nnormalized to fit the observed distribution in the redshift range z=2-2.4. Simple crosses and open circles give\nthe redshift distribution separately for 252 AGN-1 and 151 AGN-2, respectively. Right: fraction of type-2 AGN\namong all AGN for the CDF-S and HDF-N AGN selected in the 2-10 keV band (solid blue symbols) and those\ngiven in [22] (open red symbols).\n\nminosity objects are largely surrounded by the\ncircumnuclear starburst region they are feeding\nfrom (see e.g. [48]).\nThese, still preliminary, new results paint a\ndramatically different evolutionary picture for\nlow-luminosity AGN compared to the highluminosity QSOs.\nWhile the rare, highluminosity objects can form and feed very efficiently rather early in the universe, the bulk of\nthe AGN has to wait much longer to grow. This\ncould indicate two modes of accretion and black\nhole growth with different accretion efficiency, as\ne.g. proposed in [49]. The late evolution of the\nlow-luminosity Seyfert population is very similar\nto that which is required to fit the Mid-infrared\nsource counts and background (see e.g. [17]),\nhowever, contrary to what has been assumed by\nFranceschini et al., this evolution applies to all\nlow-luminosity AGN (type-1 and type-2).\nThese results, however, have still to be taken\nwith a grain of salt. First, the spectroscopic incompleteness in the Chandra samples is still substantial and before a formal publication of all\nspectroscopic and photometric redshifts is avail-\n\nable, it is too early to draw final conclusions.\nAcknowledgments\nI thank my colleagues in the the Chandra Deep\nField South team and the Lockman Hole team,\nbut in particular X.
