By constructing, in the relative case, objects analoguous to Rips and Sela's canonical\nrepresentatives, we prove that the set of conjugacy classes of images by morphisms without accidental parabolic,\nof a finitely presented group in a relatively hyperbolic group, is finite.\n\nAn important result of W.Thurston is :\nTheorem 0.1 ([T] 8.8.6)\nLet S be any hyperbolic surface of finite area, and N any geometrically finite hyperbolic 3manifold. There are only finitely many conjugacy classes of subgroups G \u2282 \u03c01 (N ) isomorphic\nto \u03c01 (S) by an isomorphism which preserves parabolicity (in both directions).\nIt is attractive to try to formulate a group-theoretic analogue of this statement : the problem\nis to find conditions such that the set of images of a group G in a group \u0393 is finite up to conjugacy.\nIf \u0393 is word-hyperbolic and G finitely presented, this has been the object of works by\nM.Gromov ([G] Theorem 5.3.C') and by T.Delzant [Del], who proves the finiteness (up to conjugacy) of the set of images by morphisms not factorizing through an amalgamation or an HNN\nextension over a finite group.\nAs a matter of fact, if a group G splits as A \u2217C B and maps to a group \u0393 such that the image\nof C in \u0393 has a large centralizer, then in general, there are infinitely many conjugacy classes of\nimages of G in \u0393. Technically speaking, if h is the considered map, one can conjugate h(A) by\nelements in the centralizer of h(C), without modifying h(B), hence producing new conjugacy\nclasses of images. A similar phenomenon happens with HNN extensions.\nWe are interested here in the images of a group in a relatively hyperbolic group (for example,\na geometrically finite Kleinian group). Our result, Theorem 0.2, gives a condition similar to\nthe one of Thurston, ruling out the bad situation depicted above, and ensuring the expected\nfiniteness.\nRelatively hyperbolic groups were introduced by M.Gromov in [G], and studied by B.Farb [F]\nand B.Bowditch [B2], who gave different, but equivalent, definitions (see Definition 1.2 below,\ntaken from [B2]). In Farb's terminology, we are interested in \"relatively hyperbolic groups with\nthe property BCP\". The main example is the class of fundamental groups of geometrically finite\nmanifolds (or orbifolds) with pinched negative curvature (see [B1], see also [F] for the case of\nfinite volume manifolds). Sela's limit groups are hyperbolic relative to their maximal abelian\nnon-cyclic subgroups, as shown in [D].\nDefinition : We say that a morphism from a group in a relatively hyperbolic group h : G \u2192\n\u0393 has an accidental parabolic either if h(G) is parabolic in \u0393, or if h can be factorized through a\n\u2217\n\nE-mail : dahmani@math.u-strasbg.fr\n\n1\n\n\fnon-trivial amalgamated free product G GG\nG\n\nh\n\n// \u0393\nOO\n\nGG\nGG\nf GG## ##\n\nh\n// \u0393\nOO\nDD\nDD\nD\nf DD!! !!\n\nor HNN extension G D\n\nA \u2217C B\nwhere f is surjective, and the image of C is either finite or parabolic in \u0393.\nWe prove the theorem :\n\nA\u2217C\n\nTheorem 0.2 Let G be a finitely presented group, and \u0393 a relatively hyperbolic group. There\nare finitely many subgroups of \u0393, up to conjugacy, that are images of G in \u0393 by a morphism\nwithout accidental parabolic.\nIt would have been tempting to apply this to the mapping class group M od(S) of a surface,\nwhich is known to be \"relatively hyperbolic\", after the study of H.Masur and Y.Minsky of the\ncomplex of curves [MM] (see also [B3]). If B is the base of a S-bundle, the study of homomorphisms \u03c01 (B) \u2192 M od(S) is important because it is directly related to the geometric Shafarevich\nconjecture (see the survey of C.McMullen [McM]). Unfortunately, the relative hyperbolicity of\nthe mapping class group is to be understood in a weak sense : the property BCP, or equivalently\nthe fineness (see Definition 1.2) is not fulfilled.\nAlso note that Theorem 0.2 generalises Theorem 0.1 in the case of closed surfaces: if a\nsurface group \u03c01 (S) acts on a tree, an element associated to a simple curve in S fixes an edge.\nTherefore, if a morphism from \u03c01 (S) to \u03c01 (N ) (with notations of Theorem 0.1) has an accidental\nparabolic, it sends a simple curve of the closed surface S in a parabolic subgroup of \u03c01 (N ).\nWe will begin by introducing the definitions and the objects of the theory of relatively\nhyperbolic groups. Then, in order to follow Delzant's idea in [Del], we will generalize, in section\n2, the construction of canonical cylinders of Rips and Sela [RS] (Theorems 2.9 and 2.22). The\nmain difficulty comes from the fact that the considered hyperbolic graph is no longer locally\nfinite. Finally, we prove Theorem 0.2 in section 3.\nI would like to thank Thomas Delzant for the interesting discussions we had. I am deeply\ngrateful to Brian Bowditch, for his useful comments on this work.\n\n1\n\nRelatively Hyperbolic Groups.\n\n1.1\n\nDefinitions\n\nA graph is a set of vertices with a set of edges, which are pairs of vertices. One can equip a graph\nwith a metric where edges have length 1. Thus this geometrical realization allows to consider\ngeodesic, quasi-geodesic and locally geodesic paths in a graph. A circuit in a graph is a simple\nsimplicial loop (without self intersection). In [B2], B. Bowditch introduces fine graphs :\nDefinition 1.1 (Fineness)[B2]\nA graph K is fine if for all L > 0, for all edge e, the set of the circuits of length less than L,\ncontaining e is finite. It is uniformly fine if this set has cardinality bounded above by a constant\ndepending only on L.\nWe will use this definition as a finiteness property of certain non-locally finite graphs.\nDefinition 1.2 (Relatively Hyperbolic Groups)[B2]\nA group \u0393 is hyperbolic relative to a family of subgroups G, if it acts on a hyperbolic and\nfine graph K, such that stabilizers of edges are finite, the quotient \u0393\\K is a finite graph, and\n2\n\n\fthe stabilizers of the vertices of infinite valence are exactly the elements of G, and are finitely\ngenerated.\nWe will say that such a graph is associated to the relatively hyperbolic group \u0393. A subgroup\nof an element of G is said to be parabolic.\nAs there are finitely many orbits of edges, a graph associated to a relatively hyperbolic group\nis uniformly fine.\n\n1.2\n\nAngles and Cones\n\nAs already explained in [DY], from which this section is partially borrowed, angles and cones\nare useful tools for the study of fine graphs.\nDefinition 1.3 (Angles)\nLet K be a graph, and let e1 = (v, v1 ) and e2 = (v, v2 ) be edges with one common vertex\nv. The angle Angv (e1 , e2 ), is the shortest length of the shortest of the paths from v1 to v2 , in\nK \\ {v}. It is +\u221e if there is no such path.\nThe angle Angv (p, p\u2032 ) between two simple simplicial (oriented) paths p and p\u2032 having a\ncommon vertex v is the angle between their first edges after this vertex.\nIf p is a simple simplicial path, and v one of its vertices, Angv (p) is the angle between the\nconsecutive edges of p at v, and its maximal angle MaxAng(p) is the maximal angle between\nconsecutive edges of p.\nIn the notation Angv (p, p\u2032 ), we will sometimes omit the subscript if there is no ambiguity.\nProposition 1.4 (Three useful remarks)\n1. When defined : Angv (e1 , e3 ) \u2264 Angv (e1 , e2 ) + Angv (e2 , e3 ).\n2. If \u03b3 is an isometry, Angv (e1 , e2 ) = Ang\u03b3v (\u03b3.e1 , \u03b3.e2 ).\n3. Any circuit (simple loop) of length L \u2265 2 has a maximal angle less than L \u2212 2.\nThe first statement follows from the triangular inequality for the length distance of K \\ {v}.\nThe second statement is obvious. Finally, if e1 = (v1 , v) and e2 = (v, v2 ) are two consecutive\nedges in the circuit, the circuit itself gives a path of length L \u2212 2 from v1 and v2 avoiding v. \u0003\nDefinition 1.5 (Cones)\nLet K be a graph, d > 0 and \u03b8 > 0. Let e be an edge, and v one of its vertices. The cone\ncentered at (e, v), of radius d and angle \u03b8 is the set of vertices w at distance less than d from v\nand such that there exists a geodesic [v, w] satisfying the property that its maximal angle and its\nangle with e are less than \u03b8 :\nConed,\u03b8 (e, v) = {w | |w \u2212 v| \u2264 d, MaxAng[v, w] \u2264 \u03b8, Angv (e, [v, w]) \u2264 \u03b8}\nProposition 1.6 (Bounded angles imply local finiteness)\nLet K be a fine graph. Given an edge e and a number \u03b8 > 0, there exists only finitely many\nedges e\u2032 adjacent to e such that Ang(e, e\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03b8.\nProof : There are only finitely many circuits shorter than \u03b8 containing e. \u0003\nCorollary 1.7 (Cones are finite)\nIn a fine graph, the cones are finite sets. If the graph is uniformly fine, the cardinality of\nConed,\u03b8 (e, v) can be bounded above by a function of d and \u03b8.\n3\n\n\fConsider a cone Coned,\u03b8 (e, v). We argue by induction on d. If d = 1, the result is given by\nthe previous proposition. If d > 1, we remark that Coned,\u03b8 (e, v) is contained in the union of\ncones of angle \u03b8 and radius 1, centered at edges whose vertices are both in Cone(d\u22121),\u03b8 (e, v). If\nthe latter is finite, the union is also finite. \u0003\nLemma 1.8 (Large angles in triangles)\nLet [x, y] and [x, z] be geodesic segments in a \u03b4-hyperbolic graph, and assume that Angx ([x, y], [x, z]) =\n\u03b8 \u2265 50\u03b4. Then the concatenation of the two segments is still a geodesic. Moreover x belongs to\nany geodesic segment [y, z] and Angx ([y, z]) \u2265 \u03b8 \u2212 50\u03b4.\nProof : Let [y, z] be a geodesic, defining a triangle (x, y, z), which is \u03b4-thin. If both segments\n[x, y] and [x, z] are shorter than 10\u03b4, then, |y \u2212 z| \u2264 20\u03b4, and the total length of the edges of\nthe triangle is less than 40\u03b4, The third part of Proposition 1.4 proves that x \u2208 [y \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ], and\nAngx ([y \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ]) \u2265 \u03b8 \u2212 50\u03b4.\nAssume that [x, y] is shorter than 10\u03b4, and that [x, z] is longer than 10\u03b4. Let z \u2032 be the point\non [x, z] at distance 13\u03b4 from x. By triangular inequality, |z \u2032 \u2212 y| \u2265 3\u03b4 and therefore, there\nexists a vertex z \u2032\u2032 on [y, z] at distance at most \u03b4 from z \u2032 . By triangular inequality, the segment\n[z \u2032\u2032 , y] has length at most 24\u03b4, and therefore, the loop [x, z \u2032 ][z \u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ][z \u2032\u2032 , y][y, x] has length at most\n48\u03b4. The segment [z \u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ] is at distance at least 12\u03b4 from x, and therefore, it does not contain it.\nAgain, the third part of Proposition 1.4 proves that x \u2208 [y \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ], and Angx ([y \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ]) \u2265 \u03b8 \u2212 50\u03b4.\nAssume now that both [x, y] and [x, z] are longer than 10\u03b4. We consider the vertices y \u2032 and z \u2032\non [x, y] and [x, z] located at distance 10\u03b4 from x. If there is a path of length less than 3\u03b4 between\ny \u2032 and z \u2032 , it cannot contain x, and therefore, it would contradict that the angle at x is greater\nthan 50\u03b4. Therefore y \u2032 and z \u2032 are not 3\u03b4-close to each other, thus, they are \u03b4-close to the segment\n[y, z], and we set y \u2032\u2032 , respectively z \u2032\u2032 , in [y, z] at distance less than \u03b4 from x\u2032 , respectively y \u2032 .\nConsider the loop [x, y \u2032 ][y \u2032 , y \u2032\u2032 ][y \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ][z \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032 ][z \u2032 , x]. Its length is less than (2 \u00d7 10\u03b4 + 2\u03b4) \u00d7 2 \u2264 50\u03b4,\nand it contains x. The segments [y \u2032 , y \u2032\u2032 ] and [z \u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ] are at distance at least 9\u03b4 from x, so that\nthey do not contain x. Here again, the third part of Proposition 1.4 proves that x \u2208 [y \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ],\nand Angx ([y \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ]) \u2265 \u03b8 \u2212 50\u03b4. \u0003\nLemma 1.9 (Cones and circuits)\nLet e be an edge of a graph, and w a vertex that lies in a circuit containing e and of length\nless than L. Then w \u2208 ConeL,L (e, v).\nProof : Let C be the considered circuit, and let g be a geodesic segment between v and w.\nThe concatenation of g and one of the two paths in C from w to v is a loop. Hence, one has\ntwo loops containing g, one of them containing e, one not, and both of length less than L. If\ng has an angle greater than L, then the corresponding vertex would not be in a sub-circuit of\neach of the two loops, and therefore, the circuit C would pass through this point twice, which\ncontradicts the definition of circuit. For the same reason the angle between e and g is less than\nL, and therefore, w \u2208 ConeL,L (e, v). \u0003\nDefinition 1.10 Let \u039b be a number. A \u039b-quasi-geodesic in a metric space X is a path q :\n[a, b] \u2192 X such that for all x and y, |x\u2212y|\n\u039b \u2264 dist(q(x), q(y)) \u2264 \u039b|x \u2212 y|.\nProposition 1.11 (Conical stability of quasi-geodesics)\nLet \u039b be a positive number. In a \u03b4-hyperbolic graph K, let g : [a, b] \u2192 K be a geodesic segment,\nand let q : [a, b] \u2192 K be a \u039b-quasi-geodesic with |q(a)\u2212g(a)| \u2264 r and |q(b)\u2212g(b)| \u2264 r, for r \u2264 10\u03b4.\nLet w be a vertex in q at distance at least 2r from the ends. Then there exists a constant N\u039b,\u03b4\ndepending only on \u039b, and \u03b4, and there exists an edge e in g, such that w \u2208 ConeN\u039b,\u03b4 ,N\u039b,\u03b4 (e, v).\n4\n\n\fw\nq\nv\ng\n\ne\n\nFigure 1: Quasi-geodesics stay in cones centered on the geodesic, Proposition 1.11\n\nProof : It is a classical fact ([G], 7.2 A, [CDP], [GH]) that there exists a number D(\u039b, \u03b4)\nsuch that q remains at a distance less than D(\u039b, \u03b4) from the segment, for a certain constant\nD(\u039b, \u03b4). We consider the loop starting at w, consisting of five part : a subsegment [w, w1 ] of q,\nof length less than 10.D(\u039b, \u03b4), and strictly less if and only if w1 = q(b), a segment [w1 , w2 ] of\nlength less than D(\u039b, \u03b4) and where w2 \u2208 g (we call it a transition), a subsegment [w2 , w3 ] of g of\nlength less than 20.D(\u039b, \u03b4) (strictly less if and only if w3 = g(a)), then again a transition from\nw3 to q shorter than D(\u039b, \u03b4), and then a subsegment of q to w. As, in any case w is sufficiently\nfar from the transitions, with respect to their length, it does not belong to them, and this loop\ncontains a sub-circuit shorter than 25\u039bD(\u039b, \u03b4), containing w and an edge of g. Lemma 1.9 gives\nthe result. \u0003\n\n2\n\nCanonical cylinders for a family of triangles\n\nIn the following, K is a graph associated to a relatively hyperbolic group \u0393, and is \u03b4-hyperbolic.\nWe choose a base point p in K. We assume, without loss of generality, that \u03b4 is an integer\ngreater than 1.\nThe aim of this section is, given a finite family F of elements of \u0393, to find a finite set (a\ncylinder ) around each segment [p, \u03b3p] with \u03b3 \u2208 F \u222a F \u22121 . This construction will be such that for\nall \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 in F \u222a F \u22121 that satisfy the equation (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = 1), the three cylinders around [p, \u03b1p],\n[\u03b1p, \u03b1\u03b2p] = \u03b1[p, \u03b2p] and [p, \u03b3 \u22121 p] = [\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3p, \u03b1\u03b2p], coincide pairwise on large subsets around the\nvertices p, \u03b1p and \u03b1\u03b2p (see Theorem 2.9).\nOur approach is similar to the original one in [RS]. However, let us emphasize that Rips and\nSela use the fact that the balls in Cayley graphs are finite. In the graph we are working on, it\nis not the case.\n\n2.1\n\nCoarse piecewise geodesics\n\nWe choose some constants : \u03bb = 1000\u03b4, \u01eb = N\u03bb,\u03b4 and \u03bc = (100\u01eb + \u03bb2 ) \u00d7 40\u03bb (N\u03bb,\u03b4 is as in\nProposition 1.11). These constants will be useful for defining coarse piecewise geodesics, in the\nsense of [RS]. Roughly speaking, \u03bb will serve as constant for quasi-geodesics, \u03bc will serve as\nconstant for local geodesics, and \u01eb will be the bound for lengths of bridges.\nA path p is a \u03bc-local-geodesic if any subpath of p of length \u03bc, is a geodesic. A path p is a\nL-local- \u03bb2 -quasi-geodesic if any subpath of length at most L is a \u03bb2 -quasi-geodesic.\nDefinition 2.1 (Coarse piecewise geodesics)([RS] 2.1)\nLet l be an integer greater than \u03bc. A l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic in K is a 40\u03bb(\u01eb + 100\u03bb\u03b4)local- \u03bb2 -quasi-geodesic f : [a, b] \u2192 K together with a subdivision of the segment [a, b], a = c1 \u2264\nd1 \u2264 c2 . . . \u2264 dn = b such that\n\n5\n\n\f\u2022 f ([ci , di ]) is a \u03bc-local geodesic,\n\u2022 \u2200i, 2 \u2264 i \u2264 (n \u2212 1), length(f ([ci , di ])) \u2265 l and \u2200i, length(f [di , ci+1 ]) \u2264 \u01eb,\n\u2022 f ([a, b]) is included in the 2\u01eb-neighborhood of a geodesic segment [f (a), f (b)].\nIn this case, we say that f |[ci ,di ] is a sub-local-geodesic, and f |[di ,ci+1] is a bridge.\nRemark 1 : Any l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic is a \u03bb-quasi-godesic. This follows from [G]\n7.2B, where it is stated that any 1000\u03b4 \u03bb2 -local- \u03bb2 -quasi-geodesic is a \u03bb-quasi-geodesic. We also\ngive, in appendix of this paper, a simple proof using the third point of the definition.\nRemark 2 : If f : [a, b] \u2192 K is a coarse-piecewise-geodesic, then for all a\u2032 and b\u2032 such that\na \u2264 a\u2032 < b\u2032 \u2264 b, the path f[a\u2032 ,b\u2032 ] is a coarse-piecewise-geodesic. Indeed the induced subdivision\nsatisfies the two first points of the definition (note that there is no length condition for the first\nand the last sub-local geodesic), and the third point is satisfied since f (and therefore f |[a\u2032 ,b\u2032 ] )\nis a \u03bb-quasi-geodesic, and Proposition 1.11 applies.\nLemma 2.2 (Re-routing coarse piecewise geodesics)\nLet l \u2265 \u03bc be a number, and f : [a, b] \u2192 K be a l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic. Consider a\nsub-local-geodesic f |[c,d], and s \u2208 f ([c, d]), with the additional requirement that the subpath of\nf ([c, d]) from f (c) to s has length more than l + 2\u01eb. Let g be a geodesic segment between f (a)\nand f (b). Let s\u2032\u2032 be a closest point to s on g. Let s\u2032 be a closest point to s\u2032\u2032 on f[c,d].\nWe choose [s\u2032 , s\u2032\u2032 ] a geodesic segment between s\u2032 and s\u2032\u2032 . We note [s\u2032\u2032 , f (b)] a subsegment of\ng between s\u2032\u2032 and f (b). We note (f (a), s\u2032 ) the image by f of the real segment [a, f \u22121 (s\u2032 )].\nThen the path f \u0303 = (f (a), s\u2032 )[s\u2032 , s\u2032\u2032 ][s\u2032\u2032 , f (b)] is a l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic. We say that f\nis re-routed into f \u0303.\nProof : We define the parameterisation of f \u0303 on the real segment [a, b\u2032 ], to coincide with the\none of f on [a, f \u22121 (s\u2032 )], and to be the arc length parametrisation on [f \u22121 (s\u2032 ), b\u2032 ]. Let a = c1 <\nd1 \u2264 c2 < . . . \u2264 cm < dm = b be the subdivision of [a, b] associated to f , and let us say that\nc = cn . We define the subdivision of [a, b\u2032 ], a = c\u20321 < d1 \u2264 c\u20322 \u2264 . . . \u2264 c\u2032n < d\u2032n \u2264 c\u2032n+1 < d\u2032n+1 = b\u2032\nas coinciding with the one of the coarse-piecewise-geodesic f until cn = c, and such that dn = s\u2032 ,\ncn+1 = s\u2032\u2032 , and dn+1 = b\u2032 . It is immediate from similar property for f , that any restriction\nf |[ci ,di ] is a \u03bc-local geodesic, that for all i \u2208 [2, n \u2212 1], length(f ([ci , di ])) \u2265 l. and that for all\ni \u2208 [1, n \u2212 1], length(f ([di , ci+1 ])) \u2264 \u01eb. We know that f is a \u03bb-quasi-geodesic, therefore by 1.11,\nit stays \u01eb-close to g, hence, by triangular inequality, f \u0303 also stays \u01eb-close to g.\nWe have to show that length(f ([dn , cn+1 ])) \u2264 \u01eb, that length(f ([cn , dn ])) \u2265 l and that f \u0303 is a\n40\u03bb(\u01eb + 100\u03bb\u03b4)-local- \u03bb2 -quasi-geodesic.\nAs |s \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | \u2264 \u01eb, the segment [s\u2032 , s\u2032\u2032 ] has length less than \u01eb, which was the first requirement.\nTherefore, |s \u2212 s\u2032 | \u2264 2\u01eb, and, as we assumed that the length of f from f (c) to s is greater\nthan l + 2\u01eb , the sub-local-geodesic of f \u0303 between f (c) and s\u2032 is longer than l in this case, which\nwas the second requirement.\nWe need to prove that f \u0303 is a 40\u03bb(\u01eb + 100\u03bb\u03b4)-local- \u03bb2 -quasi-geodesic. In other words, we have\nto show that any of its subpath of length less than 40\u03bb(\u01eb + 100\u03bb\u03b4) is a \u03bb2 -quasi-geodesic. Let p\nbe such a subpath. If it is contained in the subpath of f \u0303 coinciding with f ([a, b]), by assumption\non f it is a \u03bb2 -quasi-geodesic. If it is contained in the subpath of f \u0303 coinciding with g it is a\ngeodesic segment. If p fails to satisfy both conditions above, then it intersects \u03c1, and therefore\nis contained in a subpath of length at most 40\u03bb(\u01eb + 100\u03bb\u03b4) \u2212 +2\u01eb that contains \u03c1. We give some\nnotations : let x and y be the ends of this subpath. As \u03bc \u2265 40\u03bb(\u01eb + 100\u03bb\u03b4) + 4\u01eb, the subsegment\n6\n\n\f[x, s\u2032 ] of f is a geodesic. The segment [s\u2032\u2032 , f (b)] is included in g and therefore it is a geodesic\nsegment, and it contains y. If the length of p is less than \u03bb2 = 500\u03b4, there is nothing to prove.\nIt is now enough to prove that for all such subpath p containing \u03c1, of length more than 500\u03b4,\nthe distance |x \u2212 y| between the ends x and y of p, is superior to \u03bb1 \u00d7 (|x \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | + |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 y|).\nAs the point s\u2032 is the closest point to s\u2032\u2032 in [x, s], by hyperbolicity, we have |x\u2212s\u2032 |+|s\u2032 \u2212s\u2032\u2032 | \u2264\n|x \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | + 5\u03b4.\nConsider a point u of the sub-local-geodesic f ([c, d]) that is between f (c) and x, and at\ndistance \u03bc/2 from x. As l \u2265 \u03bc \u2265 40\u03bb(\u01eb + 100\u03bb\u03b4) + 2\u01eb \u2265 |x \u2212 s\u2032 |, it is possible to find such a point.\nNote that the subpath [u, s\u2032 ] of f is of length at most \u03bc and therefore is a geodesic segment.\nMoreover, by Proposition 1.11, there is a point v on g such that |u \u2212 v| \u2264 \u01eb. As the Gromov\nproduct (v * y)s\" is equal to zero, and as (v * u)s\" \u2265 \u03bc \u2212 2\u01eb \u2212 10\u03b4 \u2265 100\u03b4, by hyperbolicity, one\nhas (y * u)s\" \u2264 \u03b4.\nSimilarily, (u * s\")x \u2264 2\u03b4, that is (u * x)s\" \u2265 |s\" \u2212 x| \u2212 5\u03b4. There is the dichotomy : either\n|s\" \u2212 x| \u2264 20\u03b4, hence |s\" \u2212 y| \u2265 length(p) \u2212 25\u03b4 \u2265 |y \u2212 x| \u2212 25\u03b4, and (y * x)s\" \u2264 45\u03b4, or\n|s\" \u2212 x| \u2265 20\u03b4, and then (u * x)s\" \u2265 20\u03b4, which together with (y * u)s\" \u2264 \u03b4, yelds (y * x)s\" \u2264 2\u03b4.\nIn any case, one has (y * x)s\" \u2264 45\u03b4. Then |x \u2212 y| \u2265 |x \u2212 s\"| + |s\" \u2212 y| \u2212 45\u03b4. We already had\n|x \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | \u2264 |x \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | + 5\u03b4, which give : |x \u2212 y| \u2265 |x \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | + |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 y| \u2212 50\u03b4, and\nas |x \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | + |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 y| was assumed to be greater than 500\u03b4, this gives the expected\n|x \u2212 y| \u2265 \u03bb1 \u00d7 (|x \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | + |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 y|). This proves the proposition. \u0003\nWe will also need the following.\nLemma 2.3 Let [x, y] be a geodesic segment of K, of length L \u2265 2\u03bc. Let s be on [x, y] such\nthat |s \u2212 x| and |s \u2212 y| are both greater than \u03bc2 . Let s\u2032 \u2208 K be at distance at most \u03b4 from s and\ny \u2032 \u2208 K be at distance at most \u03b4 from y. Let s\" be on [x, y] such that |s\u2032 \u2212 s\"| is minimal. Then\nthe path [x, s\"][s\", s\u2032 ][s\u2032 , y \u2032 ] is a 40\u03bb(\u01eb + 100\u03bb\u03b4)-local- \u03bb2 -quasi-geodesic.\nProof : As in the previous lemma, it is enough to prove that for all subpath p containing\n[s\", s\u2032 ], of length more than 500\u03b4 = \u03bb2 , the distance |x \u2212 y| between the ends p1 and p2 of p, is\nsuperior to \u03bb1 \u00d7 (|p1 \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | + |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 |).\nLet us assume that |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 | \u2265 25\u03b4. By hyperbolicity, p2 is 5\u03b4-close to a point w of [s\u2032 , y],\nand |s\u2032 \u2212 w| \u2265 |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 | \u2212 |p2 \u2212 w| \u2212 |s\u2032 \u2212 s\"|. Now |p1 \u2212 w| = |p1 \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 w| \u2265 |p1 \u2212 s\u2032 | +\n|s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 | \u2212 |p2 \u2212 w| \u2212 |s\u2032 \u2212 s\"|. As |p1 \u2212 p2 | \u2265 |p1 \u2212 w| \u2212 |w \u2212 p2 | we deduce that |p1 \u2212 p2 | \u2265\n|p1 \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 | \u2212 2|p2 \u2212 w| \u2212 |s\u2032 \u2212 s\"| \u2265 |p1 \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 s\"| \u2212 12\u03b4, which is greater\n1\n\u00d7 (|p1 \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | + |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 |), since |p1 \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | + |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 | is assumed to\nthan 1000\u03b4\nbe greater than 500\u03b4.\nIf |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 | \u2264 25\u03b4, then |p1 \u2212 p2 | \u2265 |p1 \u2212 s\"| \u2212 |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 | \u2265 |p1 \u2212 s\u2032 | + |s\u2032 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 | + |s\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 | \u2212 51\u03b4,\nand the same conclusion holds. \u0003\nCorollary 2.4 (Re-routing to another point)\nLet l be a positive number. Let f : [a, b] \u2192 K be a coarse-piecewise-geodesic whose last\nsub-local-geodesic g is a geodesic segment of length at least l + 2\u03bc. Let [f (a), f (b)] be a geodesic\nsegment of K, and let z be a point such that a geodesic segment [f (a), z] passes at distance \u03b4\nfrom f (b). Then, there exists a l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic from f (b) to z coinciding with f until\nthe first point of g.\nProof : Let f : [c, b] \u2192 K be an arc-length parametrization of the sub-local-geodesic g. One\nhas (b \u2212 c) \u2265 l + 2\u03bc. Let x = f (c + l) and y = f (b). Let y \u2032 be a point of [f (a), z] at distance less\nthan \u03b4 from y.\n7\n\n\fBy the previous lemma, there exists points s\u2032\u2032 on g, s\u2032 on [f (a), y \u2032 ] such that the path\nf ([a, c])[x, s\"][s\", s\u2032 ][s\u2032 , y \u2032 ] is a 40\u03bb(\u01eb+100\u03bb\u03b4)-local- \u03bb2 -quasi-geodesic satisfying the two first points\nof the definition of l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic. As [s\u2032 , y \u2032 ] is a subsegment of the geodesic segment\n[s\u2032 , z], the same is true for f ([a, c])[x, s\"][s\", s\u2032 ][s\u2032 , y \u2032 ].\nIt remains to show that this paths stays 2\u01eb-close to a geodesic segment [f (a), z]. Its first part\nfrom f (a) to s\u2032\u2032 is a subpath of f , hence it is a \u03bb-quasi-geodesic, therefore \u01eb-close to [f (a), f (b)],\nand therefore, (\u01eb + \u03b4)-close to [f (a), z].

The l-cylinder of two points x and y in K, denoted by Cyll (x, y), is the set of\nthe vertices v lying on a l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic from x to y, with the additional requirement\nthat v is on a sub-local-geodesic f |[c,d] with distances |f (c) \u2212 v| \u2265 l if f (c) 6= x and |f (d) \u2212 v| \u2265 l\nif f (d) 6= y.\nNext lemma will assure that cylinders are finite sets, and stay close to geodesics.\nLemma 2.6 (Cylinders are finite)\nGiven two points x and y in K, and a constant l, any l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic from x to\ny remains in the union of the cones of radius and angle \u01eb centered in the edges of an arbitrary\ngeodesic segment [x, y] (we call this union the \u01eb-conical-neighborhood of the segment).\nThe l-cylinder Cyll (x, y) is contained in the union of the cones of radius and angle \u01eb-conicalneighborhood of an arbitrary geodesic segment [x, y].\nThe l-cylinder Cyll (x, y) contains every geodesic between x and y.\nProof : The second assertion is a consequence of the first one, itself being a consequence of\nProposition 1.11 for \u039b = \u03bb, and r = 0. To prove the third assertion it is sufficient to remark that\nevery geodesic is a l-coarse-piecewise geodesic with only one sublocal geodesic, and no bridge.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.7 (Equivariance)\nIf a vertex v is in Cyll (x, y), then for all \u03b3 in the group \u0393, we have \u03b3v \u2208 Cyll (\u03b3x, \u03b3y)\nProof : Multiplication on the left by \u03b3 is an isometry of K. \u0003\n\n2.3\n\nChoosing a good constant l for l-cylinders\n\nDefinition 2.8 (Channels)([RS] 4.1)\nLet g = [v1 , v2 ] be a geodesic segment in K. A geodesic not shorter than |v2 \u2212 v1 | that stays\nin the union of the cones of radius and angle \u01eb centered in the edges of g is a (|v2 \u2212 v1 |)-channel\nof g.\nAs cones are finite (Corollary 1.7), the number of different channels of a segment of length\nL is bounded above by a constant depending only on L. We note Capa(L) such a bound.\nLet us recall the constants we fixed, and that are involved in the definition of coarse piecewise\ngeodesics : \u03bc = 100N\u03bb,\u03b4 + \u03bb2 , with \u03bb = 1000\u03b4. For an integer n, we set \u03c6(n) = 24(n +\n8\n\n\f\u03b1.p\n\n\u03b1.Cyll (p, \u03b2.p)\n\nCyll (p, \u03b1.p)\n\u03b3 \u22121 .p\n\np\n\u22121\n\nCyll (p, \u03b3 .p)\n3(\u03bc + \u03bb(n, \u03b4))\nFigure 2: Cylinders for a triangle, Theorem 2.9\n\n1)Capa(\u03bc)(2\u01eb + 1)\u01eb. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03c6(n)\n2\u01eb , we set now li = 10\u03bc + 2i\u01eb. Each li is inferior to\n\u03c6(n) + 10\u03bc.\nWe denote by Br (x) the ball of K of center x and radius r.\nTheorem 2.9 Let F be a finite family of elements of \u0393 ; we set n = (2Card(F ))3 where Card(F )\nis the cardinality of F . Let p be a base point in K.\nThere exists a number l such that the l-cylinders satisfy : for all \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 in F \u222a F \u22121 with\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = 1, in the triangle (x, y, z) = (p, \u03b1p, \u03b3 \u22121 p) in K, one has\nCyll (x, y) \u2229 BRx,y,z (x) = Cyll (x, z) \u2229 BRx,y,z (x)\n(and analogues permuting x, y and z) where Rx,y,z = (y * z)x \u2212 4 \u00d7 (11\u03bc + \u03c6(n)), is the Gromov\nproduct in the triangle, minus a constant.\nWhat is important in the theorem is not so much the value of l, but that the numbers\n(y * z)x \u2212 Rx,y,z involved are bounded in terms of n and of K (namely, \u03b4 and the cardinality of\na cone of radius and angle \u01eb). This bound does not depend on the family F , although it does\ndepend on its cardinality.\nProof : We will find a correct constant l among the li previously defined. We have 12(n +\n1)Capa(\u03bc)(2\u01eb + 1) different candidates. There are at most n different triangles satisfying the\ncondition, hence, we have a system of at most 6n equations of the form Cyll (x, y) \u2229 BRx,y,z (x) \u2282\nCyll (x, z) \u2229 BRx,y,z (x). It is then enough to prove the next lemma.\nLemma 2.10 Let x, y, z be three points in K. There are at most 2Capa(\u03bc)(2\u01eb + 1) different\nconstants among the li , i = 1.. \u03c6(n)\n2\u01eb , such that Cyll (x, y) \u2229 BRx,y,z (x) 6 \u2282Cyll (x, z) \u2229 BRx,y,z (x).\nProof : We argue by contradiction, assuming that (2Capa(\u03bc)(2\u01eb + 1)+ 1) constants li do not\nsatisfy the equation Cyll (x, y) \u2229 BRx,y,z (x) \u2282 Cyll (x, z) \u2229 BRx,y,z (x). For each of them, there is a\nvertex vi in one cylinder and not in the other : there exists \u03b2i , a li -coarse-piecewise-geodesic from\n9\n\n\fx to y containing vi as indicated in Definition 2.5, but there is no such coarse-piecewise-geodesic\nfrom x to z.\nBy Lemma 2.6, each of the coarse-local-geodesics \u03b2i (i = 1.. \u03c6(n)\n2\u01eb ) is contained in the \u01ebconical-neighborhood (in the sense of Lemma 2.6) of [x, y].\nAs \u01eb \u2264 \u03bc/2, and li \u2265 10\u03bc, each of the \u03b2i has a sub-local-geodesic passing through a \u03bcchannel of a subsegment of [x, y] starting at distance Rx,y,z + (\u03c6(n) + 10\u03bc) from x or at distance\nRx,y,z +(\u03c6(n)+11\u03bc). There are less than 2Capa(\u03bc) such channels. Therefore, there is a channel,\ndenoted by Chan, in which a sub-local geodesic \u03b2i\u2032 = \u03b2i |[ci ,di ] passes for at least 2\u01eb + 2 different\nindexes i \u2208 [1, \u03c6(n)\n2\u01eb ]. Let us re-label 2\u01eb + 2 of these indexes : i1 < i2 < . . . < i2\u01eb+2 .\nFor each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2\u01eb + 2, let tj \u2208 [cij , dij ] be the instant where \u03b2i\u2032j (tj ) exits the channel Chan.\nLet us denote by r(\u03b2i\u2032j ) the length of the path \u03b2i\u2032j ([tj , dij ]), the part of \u03b2i\u2032j after it leaves the\nchannel Chan. The discussion will hold on the respective possible values of the numbers r(\u03b2i\u2032j ),\nfor 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2\u01eb + 2.\nWe now formulate and prove three claims.\nClaim 1 : For the any j \u2208 [1, 2\u01eb + 2], one has r(\u03b2i\u2032j ) \u2264 lij + 2\u01eb.\n+\n\u2032\nAssume the contrary. Let t+\nj > tj be real number such that the length of \u03b2ij ([tj , tj ]) equals\nlij . Then, by Lemma 2.2, \u03b2ij can be rerouted into a li -coarse-piecewise-geodesic coinciding with\n+\n\u03b2ij from x to \u03b2ij (t+\nj ), coinciding with [x, y] on a suffix starting at a point 3\u01eb-close to \u03b2ij (tj ),\nand ending at y. Recall that \u03b2ij (tj ) is the end point of the channel Chan. By triangular\ninequality, |x \u2212 \u03b2ij (tj )| \u2264 [Rx,y,z + (\u03c6(n) + 11\u03bc) + \u01eb + \u03bc]. Therefore, \u03b2ij (t+\nj ) is at distance at most\n[Rx,y,z + (\u03c6(n) + 11\u03bc) + \u01eb + \u03bc] + (\u03c6(n) + 10\u03bc) + \u01eb \u2264 (y * z)x \u2212 2\u03c6(n) \u2212 22\u03bc from x. Therefore, by\nCorollary 2.4, at distance lij \u2264 (\u03c6(n) + 10\u03bc) after the bridge of the re-routing, it can be rerouted\ninto a li -coarse-piecewise-geodesic coinciding with \u03b2ij from x to \u03b2ij (t+\nj ) that ends at z. This\nshows that vi1 is in the cylinders Cyli1 (x, z), which contradicts our assumption, and proves the\nclaim.\nClaim 2 : For any two indices ij < ik , one has r(\u03b2i\u2032k ) < r(\u03b2i\u2032j ).\nIf not, one could change \u03b2ij just after Chan, into \u03b2ik (it remains a lij -coarse-piecewisegeodesic). On \u03b2ik , let \u03b2i\u2032\u2032k be the sublocal geodesic following \u03b2i\u2032k . It is on length lik \u2265 lij + 2\u01eb.\n+\n\u2032\u2032\nLet t+\nk be real such that \u03b2ik (tk ) is the point located on \u03b2ik at distance lij + 2\u01eb from its beginning.\nRecall (see paragraph above) that |x \u2212 \u03b2ij (tj )| \u2264 [Rx,y,z + (\u03c6(n) + 11\u03bc) + \u01eb + \u03bc]. By Claim 1, we\ndeduce that \u03b2ik (t+\nk ) is at distance at most [Rx,y,z + (\u03c6(n) + 11\u03bc) + \u01eb + \u03bc] + 2 \u00d7 (\u03c6(n) + 10\u03bc) + 3\u01eb \u2264\n(y * z)x \u2212 2 \u00d7 (\u03c6(n) + 10\u03bc + 2\u01eb) from x, and therefore, by Lemma 2.2, it is possible to reroute the\ncoarse-piecewise-geodesic, into a lij -coarse-piecewise-geodesic coinciding with \u03b2ij until Chan,\nand coinciding with the suffix of [x, y] starting at (y * z)x \u2212 2 \u00d7 (\u03c6(n) + 10\u03bc from x, and ending at\ny. Then, by Corollary 2.4, it is possible to reroute it again on into a lij -coarse-piecewise-geodesic\nending at z, which is a contradiction, as in Claim 1.\nClaim 3 : For all ik \u2264 2\u01eb + 2, one has r(\u03b2i\u20321 ) \u2212 r(\u03b2i\u2032k ) < 2\u01eb.\nIf not, we could change \u03b2ik just after Chan, by passing by \u03b2i\u20321 , and reroute it on [x, y] before\nthe end of \u03b2i\u20321 (at distance 2\u01eb from the end). This again gives the same contradiction.\nNow that the three claims have been proved, we can end the proof of Lemma 2.10.\nWe see from the second claim that the 2\u01eb + 2 numbers r(\u03b2i\u2032j ), for j \u2264 2\u01eb + 2, are all different,\nand, from the third claim, that they are all in an interval of N of length 2\u01eb (hence containing\n2\u01eb + 1 elements). This is a contradiction. \u0003\n\n10\n\n\f2.4\n\nDecomposition of cylinders into slices\n\nIn this section we assume that the hypothesis of Theorem 2.9 are fulfilled, and we choose l a\nsuitable constant as in the statement of this theorem. All considered cylinders will implicitly be\nl-cylinders.\nRecall that there are only finitely many orbits of vertices of finite valence in K, therefore,\nthere exists a constant \u03c1 such that any pair of edges (e, e\u2032 ) containing a vertex of finite valence\nv makes an angle Angv (e, e\u2032 ) bounded above by \u03c1.\nLet \u0398 = max{10000(D + \u01eb + \u03b4), \u03c1}, where D is a constant such that a \u03bb-quasi-geodesic\nremains at distance D from a geodesic in a \u03b4-hyperbolic graph (here \u03bb = 1000\u03b4).\nThe decomposition into slices given by Rips and Sela in the hyperbolic case ([RS]) will not\nwork properly here, because of large angles. Thus, we choose a slightly different procedure.\nDefinition 2.11 (Parabolic slices in a cylinder)\nLet a and b two points in K. In the cylinder Cyl(a, b), a parabolic slice is a singleton {v} \u2282\nCyl(a, b) such that there exists vertices w and w\u2032 in Cyl(a, b), adjacent to v in K and such that\nAngv ((v, w), (v, w\u2032 )) \u2265 \u0398. The angle of a parabolic slice is M axw,w\u2032 \u2208Cyl (Angv ((v, w), (v, w\u2032 )).\nNote that, since \u0398 \u2265 \u03c1, any parabolic slice consists of a vertex of infinite valence. This\njustifies the name.\nLemma 2.12 (Parabolic slice implies large angle on a geodesic segment)\nLet a and b be two points in K, and let A be a number greater than \u0398. If w and w\u2032 are\nvertices in the cylinder Cyl(a, b), such that |w \u2212 w\u2032 | \u2264 50\u03b4, and if there exists v on some\ngeodesic [w, w\u2032 ] such that Angv ([v, w], [v, w\u2032 ]) = A, then any geodesic segment [a, b] contains v,\nand Angv ([a, b]) \u2265 A \u2212 20D \u2265 A \u2212 \u0398.\nIf {v} is a parabolic slice of a cylinder Cyl(a, b), of angle A, then, any geodesic segment [a, b]\ncontains v, and Angv ([a, b]) \u2265 A \u2212 20D \u2265 A \u2212 \u0398.\nProof : The second assertion is an immediate corollary of the first one, and of Definition\n2.11.\nLet w and w\u2032 be vertices in Cyl(a, b), and v be such that |w \u2212 v| + |v \u2212 w\u2032 | = |w \u2212 w\u2032 | \u2264 50\u03b4\nin K, and such that Angv ([v, w], [v, w\u2032 ]) = A \u2265 \u0398, for some geodesic segments [v, w] and [v, w\u2032 ].\nAs w is in the cylinder Cyl(a, b), there exists a l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic f : [0, T ] \u2192 K,\nwith f (0) = a and f (T ) = b, such that f (s) = w for some s \u2208 [0, T ], and such that w is on a\nsub-local geodesic f |[r,t] of f , |r \u2212 s| (resp. |s \u2212 t|) being larger than 10\u03bc, except if r = 0 (resp\n(t = T ).\nAs f is a quasi-geodesic, at least one of the segments f |[s,t], and f |[r,s] does not contain v.\nLet us assume that f |[r,s] does not contain v. We set s1 = max{0, s \u2212 3D}, and we choose x in\na geodesic segment [a, b] such that the distance |x \u2212 f (s1 )| is minimal (it is less than D, and it\nis equal to 0 if s1 = 0). Let [x, f (s1 )] be a geodesic segment. We claim that this segment does\nnot contain v. If s1 = 0 the segment is exactly one point equal to a, and it cannot be v since\na is never a parabolic slice. If s1 = s \u2212 3D, the subpath [f (s1 ), w] of f is included in a \u03bc-local\ngeodesic, and is of length 3D < \u03bc. Hence it is a geodesic, and therefore |f (s1 ) \u2212 w| = 3D. By\ntriangular inequality, |f (s1 ) \u2212 v| \u2265 3D \u2212 50\u03b4 > |f (s1 ) \u2212 x|, and therefore, [f (s1 ), x] does not\ncontain v, which is the claim.\nTherefore there is a path p from w to x of length at most 4D not containing v.\nWe do the same construction for w\u2032 : there exists x\u2032 on [a, b] and a path p\u2032 from w\u2032 to x\u2032 of\nlength at most 4D, not containing v. By triangular inequality, |x \u2212 x\u2032 | \u2264 8D + 50\u03b4 \u2264 9D.\n11\n\n\fWe now consider the path obtained by concatenation of p, [x, x\u2032 ], and p\u2032 (with reverse\norientation). Its length is at most 17D < A \u2212 50\u03b4. Therefore, the segment [x, x\u2032 ] must contain\nv, and the triangular inequality for angles shows that Angv ([x, x\u2032 ]) \u2265 A \u2212 17D. \u0003\nLemma 2.13 (Angles at the end of cylinders)\nLet x 6= b be in Cyl(a, b). Then for all geodesic segments [a, b] and [x, b], Angb ([x, b], [a, b]) \u2264\n14D.\nProof : We distinguish two cases. First assume that |x \u2212 b| \u2265 3D. We know that there is a\nvertex w on the segment [a, b] such that |w \u2212 x| \u2264 D. Therefore, in a geodesic triangle (b, w, x),\nthe segment [b, x] and [b, w] remain \u03b4-close for a length at least D \u2265 10\u03b4. Therefore, their angle\nat b is less than 21\u03b4, and it is less than 14D.\nSecondly, assume that |x \u2212 b| \u2264 3D. There is a coarse-piecewise-geodesic f : [0, T ] \u2192 K\nbetween a and b, containing x on one of its sub-local geodesic. Let t be such that f (t) = x.\nConsider t1 = max{0, t \u2212 3D}, and we choose w \u2208 [a, b] such that the distance |w \u2212 f (t1 )| is\nminimal (it is less than D in any case, and it is 0 if t1 = 0). Now we consider the path p\nobtained by the concatenation of a geodesic segment [w, f (t1 )] (of length at most D), of f |[t1 ,t]\n(of length at most 3D), of a geodesic segment [x, b] (of length at most 3D), and of a subsegment\n[b, w] \u2282 [b, a] (of length at most 7D by triangular inequality). As f is a quasi-geodesic, and\nf (T ) = b, we deduce that b is not on the path f |[t1 ,t] . It is not on the segment [w, f (t1 )] because\n|w \u2212 f (t1 )| \u2264 |f (t1 ) \u2212 b|. Therefore, the path p passes only once at the vertex b, and therefore,\nAngb ([x, b], [b, a]) \u2264 14D.\nWe see that in any case, Angb ([x, b], [b, a]) \u2264 14D. \u0003\nLemma 2.14 (Angles in a cylinder)\nLet [a, b] be a geodesic segment, such that for some vertex v in [a, b], Angv ([a, b]) > \u0398 \u2212 20D.\nThen, Cyl(a, b) = Cyl(a, v) \u222a Cyl(v, b).\nIn particular, if {v} is a parabolic slice of Cyl(a, b), then Cyl(a, b) = Cyl(a, v) \u222a Cyl(v, b).\nMoreover, in such a case, Cyl(a, v) \u2229 Cyl(v, b) = {v}.\nProof :\nLet w be a point of Cyl(a, b). There exists f : [0, T ] \u2192 K a l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic from\na to b that contains w = f (s) on one of its sub-local-geodesic, with the condition of Definition\n2.5. This coarse-piecewise-geodesic is a \u03bb-quasi-geodesics, hence stays D-close to the segment\n[a, b]. Hence, by an argument similar to Lemma 1.8, any such coarse-piecewise-geodesic passes\nat the vertex v. Let t be the real number such that f (t) = v. Then, by Remark 2, with the\ninduced subdivision, f |[0,t] is a l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic from a to v, and f |[t,T ] is a l-coarsepiecewise-geodesic from v to b. Therefore, if s \u2264 t, we have that w \u2208 Cyl(a, v), and if s \u2265 t,\nthen w \u2208 Cyl(v, b). This proves that Cyl(a, b) \u2282 Cyl(a, v) \u222a Cyl(v, b).\nLet us prove the other inclusion. Let w be a point of Cyl(a, v). There exists a l-coarsepiecewise-geodesic f : [0, T ] \u2192 K from a to v containing w on one of its sub-local-geodesic, with\nthe condition of Definition 2.5.\nLet T \u2032 = T + |v \u2212 b|, and let f \u0303 : [0, T \u2032 ] \u2192 K be as follows : f \u0303|[0,T ] \u2261 f , and f \u0303(T + t)\nis the point of the given geodesic [a, b] at distance T \u2032 \u2212 T \u2212 t from b. Let f |[c,T ] be the last\nsub-local geodesic of f , hence ending at v. Then f \u0303|[c,T \u2032 ] is still a \u03bc-local-geodesic, by Lemma\n1.8. Moreover, any subpath of length 1000\u03b4 \u03bb2 \u2264 \u03bc is a \u03bb/2-quasi-geodesic : either it is included\nin the path f , or in the geodesic segment [v, b], or it is the union of two geodesic segment that\nmeet at v with an angle greater than \u0398 \u2212 20D, and therefore is geodesic by Lemma 1.8. Finally,\n12\n\n\ff \u0303 stays at distance \u01eb from a geodesic segment [a, b]. Therefore, f \u0303 is a l-coarse-piecewise-geodesic\nfrom a to b, coincinding with f between a and v. This proves that the point w is in Cyl(a, b),\nand therefore, Cyl(a, v) \u2282 Cyl(a, b).\nSimilarly, by changing the role of a and b, one has Cyl(v, b) \u2282 Cyl(a, b) and therefore,\nCyl(a, b) = Cyl(a, v) \u222a Cyl(v, b).\nThe second assertion of the lemma is a consequence of Lemma 2.12.\nLet us prove now that the intersection Cyl(a, v)\u2229Cyl(v, b) is {v}. Let x be in the intersection\nCyl(a, v) \u2229 Cyl(v, b), and assume that x 6= v. By Lemma 2.13, Angv ([x, v], [v, a]) \u2264 14D.\nSimilarly, as x is also in Cyl(v, b), Angv ([x, v], [v, b]) \u2264 14D. The triangular inequality for angles\n(Proposition 1.4) proves that Angv ([a, v], [v, b]) is at most 28D, and contradicts the assumption\nthat it is greater than \u0398 \u2212 20D. This prove that Cyl(a, v) \u2229 Cyl(v, b) = {v}. \u0003\nThe lemma we just proved allows us to consider unions of cylinders without parabolic slice.\nThis enables the contruction of regular slices, as in Rips and Sela [RS].\nLet Cyl(a, b) be a cylinder without parabolic slice, and x \u2208 Cyl(a, b). Following [RS], we\n(a,b)\ndefine the set NR (x) as follows : it is the set of all the vertices v \u2208 Cyl(a, b) such that\n(a,b)\n|a \u2212 x| < |a \u2212 v|, and such that |x \u2212 v| > 100\u03b4. Here R stands for \"right\", and NL (x) is\nsimilarly defined changing the condition |a \u2212 x| < |a \u2212 v| into |a \u2212 x| > |a \u2212 v|. As cylinders are\nfinite, those sets are also finite.\nDefinition 2.15 (Difference in cylinders without parabolic slice)[RS]3.3\nLet Cyl(a, b) be a cylinder without parabolic slice, and x, y two points in it. We define\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\nDiff a,b (x, y) = Card(NL (x)\\NL (y))\u2212Card(NL (y)\\NL (x))+Card(NR (y)\\NR (x))\u2212\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\nCard(NR (x) \\ NR (y)), where Card(X) is the cardinality of the set X.\nLet us remark that this defines a cocycle (see [RS]).\nDefinition 2.16 (Regular slices in a cylinder without parabolic slice)\nLet Cyl(a, b) be a cylinder without parabolic slice. An equivalence class in (Cyl(a, b) \\ {a, b})\nfor the equivalence relation (Diff a,b (x, y) = 0) is called a regular slice of Cyl(a, b).\nOrdering of slices. We assign an index to each slice of Cyl(a, b) as follows. Let v1 , . . . , vk be\nthe consecutive parabolic slices, ordered by their position on a geodesic segment [a, b]. We set\nS0 to be {a}. We define then Sj+1 to be the unique regular slice of the cylinder Cyl(a, v1 ) such\nthat Diff(Sj , Sj+1 ) is minimal. If Sj is the last slice in Cyl(a, v1 ), then the parabolic slice {v1 }\nis labeled Sj+1 . Then among the regular slices of a cylinder Cyl(vi , vi+1 ), we define Sj+1 to be\nthe (unique) slice such that Diff(Sj , Sj+1 ) is minimal. If Sm is the last regular slice of a cylinder\nCyl(vi , vi+1 ) (for i < k), then the parabolic slice {vi+1 } is Sm+1 . Finally we order the slices of\nthe last cylinder Cyl(vk , b) in the same way, and {b} is the last slice (see Figure 3).\nLemma 2.17 Let a and b be two points in K, and let v be in Cyl(a, b). Let [a, b] be a geodesic\nsegment. Then there exists w \u2208 [a, b] such that |w \u2212 v| \u2264 2\u03b4.\nProof : The vertex v is on a sub-local-geodesic of some coarse-piecewise-geodesic f . By\ndefinition of the elements of cylinders, there is a geodesic segment [f (t1 ), f (t2 )] containing v,\nsuch that, for i = 1, 2, f (ti ) is at distance at most D of a point wi \u2208 [a, b], and such that either\n|v \u2212 f (ti )| \u2265 5D or f (ti ) equals to a or b (in this case, we choose wi to be f (ti )). The triangle\n(w1 , f (t1 ), f (t2 )) is is \u03b4-thin. If the segment [w1 , f (t1 )] is not reduced to a point, it remains at\n13\n\n\fdistance at least 4D from v, therefore v is at distance at most \u03b4 from a point v \u2032 of [w1 , f (t2 )].\nSimilarly, the triangle (w1 , w2 , f (t2 )) is \u03b4-thin, and therefore, v \u2032 is at distance at most \u03b4 from\n[w1 , w2 ]. Therefore, v is at distance at most 2\u03b4 from the segment [w1 , w2 ] included in [a, b]. \u0003\nLemma 2.18 Let Cyl(a, b) be a cylinder, and let x and y be two points in Cyl(a, b). Assume\nthat there is a vertex v in some geodesic segment [x, y] such that Angv ([x, y]) \u2265 2\u0398. Then, {v}\nis a parabolic slice of Cyl(a, b), and if x \u2208 Cyl(a, v) then y \u2208 Cyl(v, b).\nProof : If |x \u2212 y| \u2264 50\u03b4, the result is a consequence of Lemma 2.12.\nIf |x \u2212 y| \u2265 50\u03b4, let us parametrize the segment [x, y] by arc length: g : [0, L] \u2192 K, and let\ng(t) = v. By the previous lemma, x and y are 2\u03b4-close to a geodesic segment [a, b]. Let w and w\u2032\nbe points in [a, b] realizing this distance. By hyperbolicity the triangles (x, y, w) and (x, w, w\u2032 ) are\n\u03b4-thin. Therefore, g(t\u22125\u03b4) and g(t+5\u03b4) is 2\u03b4-close to the segment [w, w\u2032 ] \u2282 [a, b]. Let us consider\nthe path obtained by concatenation of geodesic segment :[g(t + 5\u03b4), y][y, w\u2032 ][w\u2032 , w][w, x][x, g(t \u2212\n5\u03b4)], where the first and the last segments are included in [x, y], and where [w\u2032 , w] \u2282 [b, a].\nBy triangular inequality, its total length is at most 18\u03b4. We assumed that Angv ([x, y]) \u2265 2\u0398,\ntherefore, it must contain v, and the only possibility is that v \u2208 [w\u2032 , w] \u2282 [b, a], moreover,\nAngv ([w\u2032 , w]) \u2265 2\u0398 \u2212 28\u03b4. By the third assertion of Lemma 2.6, every vertex of the segment\n[a, b] is in the cylinder Cyl([a, b]). Therefore, {v} is a parabolic slice of Cyl(a, b).\nThe second statement is a corollary of Lemma 2.13. \u0003\nLemma 2.19 (Slices are small)\nLet a and b be two points of K, and let S be a slice of Cyl(a, b). If v and v \u2032 are in S, then\n|v \u2212 v \u2032 | \u2264 200\u03b4 and for all geodesic segment [v, v \u2032 ], one has MaxAng([v, v \u2032 ]) \u2264 2\u0398.\nProof : If the slice S is parabolic, then v = v \u2032 , and there is nothing to prove. We can\nassume that the slice S is regular. We assume without loss of generality that |a \u2212 v| \u2264 |a \u2212 v \u2032 |.\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\nSuppose that |v \u2212 v \u2032 | \u2265 200\u03b4. Let us prove that NL (v) \u2282 NL (v \u2032 ).\nBy Lemma 2.17, there is a vertex w on a geodesic segment [a, b] such that |w \u2212 v| \u2264 2\u03b4, and\nsimilarily, there is w\u2032 on [a, b] such that |w\u2032 \u2212 v \u2032 | \u2264 2\u03b4. Note that, since |v \u2212 v \u2032 | \u2265 200\u03b4, the\ndistance |w\u2032 \u2212 w| is at least 196\u03b4. The points w and w\u2032 are both on the segment [a, b], therefore,\nif |a \u2212 w| > |a \u2212 w\u2032 |, then |a \u2212 w| \u2265 |a \u2212 w\u2032 | + 196\u03b4, and |a \u2212 v| > |a \u2212 v \u2032 |, contradicting our\nassumption. Therefore, |a \u2212 w| = |a \u2212 w| \u2212 |w \u2212 w\u2032 | \u2264 |a \u2212 w\u2032 | \u2212 196\u03b4.\n(a,b)\nLet z be in NL (v). As it is an element of the cylinder Cyl(a, b), by Lemma 2.17, there is\nan vertex wz of [a, b] such that |z \u2212 wz | \u2264 2\u03b4. By definition, the vertex z is at distance at least\n100\u03b4 from v, therefore |w \u2212 wz | \u2265 96\u03b4.\nMoreover, as |a \u2212 z| \u2264 |a \u2212 v| and |z \u2212 v| \u2265 100\u03b4, the vertex wz is on the subsegment [a, w]\nof [a, b]. Therefore, |wz \u2212 w\u2032 | = |wz \u2212 w| + |w \u2212 w\u2032 | \u2265 292\u03b4. This gives, by triangular inequality,\n(a,b)\n|z \u2212 v \u2032 | \u2265 290\u03b4. Therefore, z is in NL (v \u2032 ).\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\nHence, we have NL (v) \u2282 NL (v \u2032 ) and similarly NR (v \u2032 ) \u2282 NR (v). Moreover NL (v) 6=\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\nNL (v \u2032 ) (and similarly NR (v \u2032 ) 6= NR (v)), because v \u2032 is in NL (v) and not in NL (v \u2032 ).\n\u2032\nTherefore, Diff a,b (v, v ) 6= 0 which is a contradiction since they both are in the same regular\nslice.\nThe bound on the maximal angle of a geodesic segment [v, v \u2032 ] is a corollary of the Lemma\n2.18: if Angw ([v, v \u2032 ]) \u2265 2\u0398 for some w, Lemma 2.18 implies that v and w are not in the same\nslice (not even in consecutive slices). \u0003\n\n14\n\n\fv1\n\nv3\n\na\nb\n\nv2\nFigure 3: Regular and parabolic slices in a cylinder\n\nCorollary 2.20 (Consecutive slices are close)\nLet Cyl(a, b) be a cylinder, and let S and S \u2032 be two consecutive slices. Let v \u2208 S and v \u2032 \u2208 S \u2032 .\nThen |v \u2212 v \u2032 | \u2264 1000\u03b4 and MaxAng([v, v \u2032 ]) \u2264 2\u0398.\nProof : The bound of the maximal angle is a consequence of Lemma 2.18: if there was\nsuch an angle there would be a parabolic slice between S and S \u2032 , hence, they would not be\nconsecutive.\nAssume that |v \u2212 v \u2032 | \u2265 1000\u03b4, and without loss of generality, |a \u2212 v| \u2264 |a \u2212 v \u2032 | . By Lemma\n2.17, the points v and v \u2032 are 2\u03b4-close to a geodesic segment [a, b]. Let w be on [a, b], at distance\nat least 400\u03b4 from v and v \u2032 , and such that |a \u2212 v| \u2264 |a \u2212 w| \u2212 200\u03b4 \u2264 |a \u2212 w| + 200\u03b4 \u2264 |a \u2212 v \u2032 |.\nBy Lemma 2.19, w is not in S nor in S \u2032 , and as it is on a geodesic segment [a, b], it is in a slice.\nThis slice is not before S and not after S \u2032 , therefore, S and S \u2032 are not consecutive. \u0003\nLemma 2.21 (Locality of the regular slices)\nLet Cyl(a, b), and Cyl(a, c) be cylinders without parabolic slices, and let R be a number.\nAssume that Cyl(a, b) \u2229 BR (a) = Cyl(a, c) \u2229 BR (a), where BR (a) is the ball centered at a of\nradius R. Then, any slice of Cyl(a, b) included in BR\u2212200\u03b4 (a) is a slice of Cyl(a, c).\nProof : Let S be a slice of Cyl(a, b) and assume that S is included in BR\u2212200\u03b4 (a). Let v be\na point in S. There exists S \u2032 , a slice of Cyl(a, c) containing v. Let v \u2032 be an arbitrary element of\nS. We claim that v \u2032 is in S \u2032 .\n(a,c)\n(a,c)\n(a,c)\nLet us compute Diff a,c (v, v \u2032 ). It is equal to Card(NL (v) \\ NL (v \u2032 )) \u2212 Card(NL (v \u2032 ) \\\n(a,c)\n(a,c)\n(a,c)\n(a,c)\n(a,c)\nNL (v)) + Card(NR (v \u2032 ) \\ NR (v)) \u2212 Card(NR (v) \\ NR (v \u2032 )).\n(a,c)\n(a,c)\n(a,b)\n(a,c)\nNote that NL (v) = NL (v) and similarly for v \u2032 . If x is in NR (v \u2032 ) \\ NR (v), then it\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\nis 100\u03b4-close to v. Therefore, x is in Cyl(a, b), and it is in NR (v \u2032 ) \\ NR (v). Similarly the\n(a,b)\n(a,b)\n(a,c)\n(a,c)\nother inclusion holds, and one has NR (v \u2032 ) \\ NR (v) = NR (v \u2032 ) \\ NR (v).\nTherefore, Diff a,c (v, v \u2032 ) = Diff a,b (v, v \u2032 ), and it is equal to 0 since we assumed that v \u2032 \u2208 S.\nTherefore, v \u2032 \u2208 S \u2032 , and we deduce that S \u2032 \u2282 S. Similarly, one has the other inclusion, and\nS = S \u2032 . This proves the lemma. \u0003\nTheorem 2.22 (Coincidence of the decomposition in slices)\nWith the notations of Theorem 2.9, let (x, y, z) = (p, \u03b1p, \u03b3 \u22121 p) be a triangle in K, such that\n\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are in F \u222a F \u22121 , and \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = 1.\nThe ordered slice decomposition of the cylinders is as follows.\nCyl(x, y) = (S1 , S2 , . . . , Sk ,\nCyl(x, z) = (S1 , S2 , . . . , Sk ,\nCyl(y, z) = (T1 , T2 , . . . , Tm ,\n15\n\nHz ,\nHy ,\nHx ,\n\nTm , Tm\u22121 , . . . , T1 )\nVp , Vp\u22121 , . . . , V1 )\nVp , Vp\u22121 , . . . , V1 ),\n\n\fwhere S1 , . . . , Sk , T1 , . . . , Tm and V1 , . . . , Vp are slices and where each Hv , (v = x, y, z) is a\nset of at most 10\u03c6(n) consecutive slices, without parabolic slice of angle more than 3\u0398 + 100\u03b4.\nThe sets Hv are called the holes of the slice decomposition.\nProof : Consider the cylinders Cyl(x, y) and Cyl(x, z). By Theorem 2.9, they coincide in\nBRx,y,z (x). Therefore any parabolic slice of Cyl(x, y) that is located in BRx,y,z \u22122 (x) is also a\nparabolic slice of Cyl(x, z), and similarly, permuting x and y.\nLet {v} be the last common parabolic slice of these two cylinders, or v = x if they have no\ncommon parabolic slice: Cyl(x, y) = Cyl(x, v) \u222a Cyl(v, y) and Cyl(x, z) = Cyl(x, v) \u222a Cyl(v, z),\nby Lemma 2.14.\nThe ordered slices of the cylinders Cyl(x, y) and Cyl(x, z) obviously coincide at least until\nthe slice {v}.\nLet {w} be the first parabolic slice of Cyl(x, y) after {v}, or w = y if there is no such parabolic\nslice. Let {w\u2032 } be the first parabolic slice of Cyl(x, y) after {v}, or w\u2032 = z if there is none. By\nTheorem 2.9, Cyl(v, w) \u2229 BRx,y,z \u2212|x\u2212v| (v) = Cyl(v, w\u2032 ) \u2229 BRx,y,z \u2212|x\u2212v| (v). These cylinders are\nwithout parabolic slices. By Lemma 2.21, their regular slices lying in BRx,y,z \u2212|x\u2212v|\u2212200\u03b4 (v)\ncoincide.\nIn other words, the slice decomposition of Cyl(x, y) and Cyl(x, z) coincide at least until their\nlast common parabolic slice, and for all slices in B(Rx,y,z \u2212200\u03b4) (x). A similar statement holds for\nthe other pairs of cylinders.\nIt remains to prove that no hole contain a parabolic slice of angle greater than 3\u0398 + 100\u03b4.\nLet us consider such a parabolic slice S = {v} in Cyl(x, y). By Lemma 2.12, a segment [x, y]\nhas an angle greater than 2\u0398 + 100\u03b4 at the point v. Therefore, one of the two segments [x, z]\nand [z, y] (say [x, z]) has an angle greater than \u0398 at v, and we deduce that {v} is a parabolic\nslice of Cyl(x, z). As it is simultaneously a parabolic slice in Cyl(x, y) and in Cyl(x, z), it is not\nin a hole. \u0003\n\n3\n\nImage of a group in a relatively hyperbolic group\n\nIn this section we consider \u0393 a relatively hyperbolic group with associated graph K, and G a\nfinitely presented group with a morphism h : G \u2192 \u0393. We want to explain how to adapt Delzant's\nmethod, given for hyperbolic group in [Del], to the relative case, in order to obtain an analogue\nto Thurston's Theorem 0.1.\nFor conveniance, we choose the graph K with the four following properties\nIt has a base point p with trivial stabilizer. Its vertices are exactly the infinite valence\nvertices and the elements of the orbit of p. It has no pair of adjacent vertices of infinite valence.\nFinally, for a certain word metric on \u0393, one has, for all \u03b3 in \u0393, for all geodesic segment [p, \u03b3p] in\nK,\n|\u03b3p \u2212 p| \u00d7 (MaxAng([p, \u03b3p]) + 1) \u2265 |\u03b3|.\n\n(1)\n\nIt is possible to choose K satisfying these requirements : see for example the coned-off graph\nof the Cayley graph in [F], where the angles at the parabolic vertices are bounded by a word\nmetric of the parabolic subgroups, which are assumed to be finitely generated. To see that such\nthe majoration (1) is fulfilled, it suffices to see that the distance beetween two points in the\nCayley graph is bounded above by the length of a path of K between these two points plus the\nsum of the angles of this path at the vertices of infinite valence. The three other conditions are\nobvious.\n16\n\n\fRemark 3 : In such a graph, a cylinder cannot have two consecutive parabolic slices. Indeed,\na geodesic segment between two parabolic slices {v1 } and {v2 } must contain a vertex with trivial\nstabilizer, which would belong to some regular slice of Cyl(v1 , v2 ).\nDefinition 3.1 (Accidental parabolic)\nWe say that the morphism h : G \u2192 \u0393 has an accidental parabolic either if h(G) is parabolic\nin \u0393, or if there exists a non-trivial amalgamated free product A \u2217C B, or an HNN extension\nA\u2217C , and a factorization of h : G G\nGG\n\nh\n\nGG\nGG\nf GG## ##\n\nsurjective and the image of C by\n\nh\u2032\n\nor G D\nD\n\n// \u0393\nOO\n\nh\n\nDD\nDD\nf DD!! !!\n\nh\u2032\n\n// \u0393\nOO\n\nsuch that f is\n\nh\u2032\n\nA \u2217C B\nA\u2217C\nis a finite, or parabolic subgroup of \u0393.\n\nLemma 3.2 If a subgroup H of \u0393 has a finite orbit in the graph K, then either H is finite or\nit is parabolic.\nProof : The subgroup H has a subgroup of finite index P , fixing a point in K. Assume that\nH is infinite, and not equal to P . As P is also infinite, it is parabolic, and the intersection of\nall its conjugates in H is infinite. But it is easily seen from fineness that the intersection of two\ndistinct conjugates of a maximal parabolic subgroup is finite in a relatively hyperbolic group.\nHence, H is itself parabolic. \u0003\nIn the rest of this section, we prove the next theorem.\nTheorem 3.3 Let G be a finitely presented group, and \u0393 a relatively hyperbolic group. There is\na finite family of subgroups of \u0393 such that the image of G by any morphism h : G \u2192 \u0393 without\naccidental parabolic is conjugated to one of them.\nProof : Let h be a morphism h : G \u2192 \u0393. We will construct a factorisation of h through a\ncertain graph of groups, and then we will deduce that either h has an accidental parabolic, or\nh(G) is conjugated to a subgroup of \u0393 generated by small elements.\nWe choose a triangular presentation of G : G =< g1 , . . . , gk |T1 , . . . , Tn > with n relations\nwhich are words of three (or two) letters. This defines a Van Kampen polyhedron P for G,\nwhich consists of n triangles and digons.\nRecall that the base point p of the graph K associated to the relatively hyperbolic group\n\u0393, has trivial stabilizer. We consider the cylinders of the triangles, and their decomposition in\nslices obtained by the Theorems 2.9 and 2.22, for the family F = {h(g1 ), . . . , h(gk )} \u2282 \u0393 and\nthe base point p \u2208 K.\n\n3.1\n\nThe lamination \u039b on P .\n\nWe now define a lamination on P , in two steps : first by choosing markings on the edges of P ,\nand secondly by defining arcs in P between these markings.\n3.1.1\n\nMarkings on the edges of P\n\nFor a generator gi of G, let Lri be the number of regular slices of the cylinder of [p, h(gi )p] in\nK, and Lpi , the number of its parabolic slices. Let ci the loop of the polyhedron P canonically\nLr +2Lp\n\ni\nassociated to gi . Let m1i , . . . mi i\nbe (Lri + 2Lpi ) points on ci , such that, if ci (t) : [0, 1] \u2192 P\n1\n). We call them the markings\nis an arc-length parametrisation of ci , one has mki = ci (k Lr +2L\np\n+1\ni\n\n17\n\ni\n\n\fof the slice decomposition on ci . To each marking of ci we associate a slice in the cylinder of\nis\n[p, h(gi )p] in K : m1i is associated to the first slice ; if mki is associated to a regular slice, mk+1\ni\nassociated to the next slice in the ordering, if mki is associated to a parabolic slice, and if mik\u22121\nis associated to another slice (or do not exist), then mk+1\nis associated to the same slice than\ni\nis associated\nmki ; finally, if mki and mik\u22121 are associated to the same parabolic slice, then mk+1\ni\nto the next slice in the ordering. Note that every regular slice has one marking on ci associated\nto it, and every parabolic slice has two markings.\n3.1.2\n\nRegular arcs in a triangle (or a digon) of P\n\nThe lamination \u039b is defined on P by its intersection with each triangle or digon T in P .\nConsider a triangle T (with an euclidean metric) of P , whose edges ci , cj , ck correspond to\nthe relation gi gj gk = 1 of the presentation.\nConsider two markings mri of ci and msj of cj , that are associated to the same regular slice\nin the cylinders of the triangle (p, h(gi )p, h(gk\u22121 )p) in K. The segment [mri , msj ] in T is said to\nbe a regular arc.\nConsider two consecutive markings, mri and mr+1\n, of ci , associated to the same parabolic\ni\nslice of Cyl([p, h(gi )p]). There are three possibilities.\nFirst, if the slice is not equal to a slice of any of the two other cylinders (that is: if it is in a\nhole in the sense of Theorem 2.22), we do nothing.\nSecondly, if it is a slice of one, and only one, other cylinder, say Cyl([h(gi )p, h(gj )h(gi )p]),\nof cj associated to it. The segments\nthen there are two consecutive markings msj and ms+1\nj\ns+1\nr+1\nr\ns\n[mi , mj ] and [mi , mj ] are said to be also regular arcs. Note that these two segments do not\ncross.\nFinally, if the slice is a slice of Cyl([p, h(gj )p] and of Cyl([h(gj )p, h(gi )p]), there are two\nof cj , and two consecutive markings mtk and mt+1\nof ck ,\nconsecutive markings msj and ms+1\nj\nk\nr+1\ns+1\nt+1\ns\nt\nr\nassociated to it. The three segments [mi , mk ], [mi , mj ], and [mj , mk ] are regular arcs.\nThese three segments do not cross each other.\nWe do similarly after cyclic permutations of i, j and k. We denote by \u039br (T ) the union of all\nthe regular arcs in T .\n3.1.3\n\nSingular arcs in a triangle (or a digon) of P\n\nIf the slice decomposition of the triangle has a hole (in the sense of Theorem 2.22), there are\nmarkings that are not in regular arcs. In such a case, we add a singular point pT in the component\nof T \\ \u039br (T ) containing these markings. For all marking m not in \u039br (T ), the segment [m, pT ] is\nsaid to be a singular arc. Let \u039bs (T ) be the union of these singular arcs in T .\nThe lamination \u039b on P is defined by : for all triangle or digon T of P , \u039b\u2229 T = \u039br (T )\u222a \u039bs (T )\n(see figure 4).\n\n3.2\n\nGraph K on P .\n\nIn each triangle or digon T of P , we draw a (disconnected) graph KT satisfying : each connected\ncomponent of T \\KT contains one and only one leaf of \u039b\u2229T , and its intersection with the edges ci\nof T , KT \u2229 ci consists of the vertices of KT , moreover they are located on middles of consecutive\nmarkings of gi (see figure 4).\nS\nLet K be the union of all those graphs : K = ni=1 KTi . Some of the components of K have\nedges with one vertex in a hole of a slice decomposition.

Its vertices are of two kinds. First there are the\nconnected components of P \\K \u2032 , and the groups are the fundamental groups of those components.\nThere are also the components of K \u2032 of type II, and the groups are the fundamental groups of\na small tubular neighborhood. The edges of the graph of groups are the components Ki of K \u2032 ,\nand their groups are either \u03c01 (N Ki ), the fundamental group of a small tubular neighbourhood,\nin the case of a component of type I, or \u03c01 (N Ki \\ Ki ) otherwise, in type II. Note that in this\ncase, \u03c01 (N Ki \\ Ki ) is of index two in \u03c01 (N Ki ).\nLemma 3.4 ([Del] Lemma III.2.b)\nLet H be a subgroup of G stabilizing an edge of the graph of groups. Then h(H) is a subgroup\nof \u0393 that has an orbit in K which is contained in a slice. In particular, this orbit is finite.\nFor the proof, see [Del].\nIn the case of hyperbolic groups, one deduces that the subgroup is finite ; in our case, by\nLemma 3.2, it is either finite or parabolic.\nCorollary 3.5 If the map h has no accidental parabolic, then the graph of groups is a trivial\nsplitting, and h(G) is the image of a vertex group corresponding to a leaf \u03bb in P , containing\nsingular points of the lamination : h(G) is conjugated to the image of \u03c01 (\u03bb) (only defined up to\nconjugacy).\n\n3.4\n\nIf h has no accidental parabolic.\n\nIn all the following, we assume that h has no accidental parabolic: we can apply Corollary 3.5.\n\n19\n\n\fLet P\u0393 be a Van Kampen polyhedron for \u0393, for a presentation with a finite generating set :\nit is a cell complex of dimension 2, whose 1-skeleton consists of finitely many loops. The set of\nf\u0393 0 , and after the choice of a base point, we identify it with \u0393,\nvertices of its universal cover is P\nf\u0393 0 \u2248 \u0393 \u2248 (\u0393p).\nhence also with \u0393p = {\u03b3p, \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393} \u2282 K, the set of vertices of finite valence of K: P\n3.4.1\n\nLifting slices of K in \u0393\n\nf\u0393 0 in K. We want to define good preFrom the identification above, we have an inclusion of P\nf\u0393 0 \u2248 \u0393 of slices of cylinders in K. We define the pre-image S\u0393 of an arbitrary slice\nimages in P\nS as follows.\nIf S is a regular slice of a cylinder in K, which is not reduced to a vertex of infinite valence,\nthen we say that S\u0393 is S\u0393 = {\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 | \u2203s1 , s2 \u2208 S, |s1 \u2212 \u03b3p| + |\u03b3p \u2212 s2 | = |s1 \u2212 s2 |}, the set of\nelements of \u0393 that send the base point p of K on a geodesic segment with ends in S.\nIf S = {v} is a parabolic slice of a cylinder in K, or a regular slice reduced to a point of\ninfinite valence, then we define S\u0393 to be the set {\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 | |\u03b3p \u2212 v| = 1}. It is a coset of a parabolic\nsubgroup of \u0393.\n3.4.2\n\nf\u0393\nThe map h\u0303 : P\u0303 \u2192 P\n\nLet P\u0303 be the universal cover of the polyhedron P , and \u2217 a base point in it. For every i = 1 . . . k,\nfor every edge ci in the one skeleton of P , we denote by c\u0303i its image in P\u0303 starting at \u2217. We\ndefine markings on c\u0303i such that they map exactly on the ones of ci by the quotient map, and\nwe extend the construction by G-equivariance in P\u0303 . Every edge of the 1-skeleton of P\u0303 is hence\nmarked by consecutive markings.\nf\u0393 is the universal cover of P\u0393 . The morphism h can be realized as a continuous\nRecall that P\nf\u0393 such that for all i = 1 . . . k, h\u0303(c\u0303i ) is a path from h\u0303(\u2217) to h(gi )h\u0303(\u2217),\nG-equivariant map h\u0303 : P\u0303 \u2192 P\nwhere gi denotes the element of G associated to ci .\nThe map h\u0303 is completely defined on the vertices of P\u0303 . We now choose the images of the\nmarkings of each edge c \u0303i (i = 1 . . . k).\nFirst, if mji is any marking of ci associated to a slice S (without restriction), and if m\u0303ji is its\nf\u0393 , such that \u03b3 \u2208 S\u0393 .\nimage in c\u0303i then h\u0303(m\u0303ji ) is equal to a vertex \u03b3 h\u0303(\u2217) of P\nj\nSecond, if mi is a marking of ci associated to a parabolic slice S, there is an unique marking\nadjacent to mji in ci , which is associated to a slice S \u2032 6= S. Then we require that h\u0303(m\u0303ji ) = \u03b3 h\u0303(\u2217),\nwhere \u03b3 \u2208 S\u0393 is such that \u03b3p lies on some geodesic from v to a point of S \u2032 in Cyl(p, h(gi )p). We\ndenote by S\u0393 (i, j) the set of such elements \u03b3 \u2208 S\u0393 . Note that the images of the two markings of\na parabolic slice might be very far from each other in \u0393, in the same coset of parabolic subgroup.\nThird, if mji is a marking of ci associated to a regular slice S reduced to a vertex of infinite\nvalence S = {v}, then we require that h\u0303(m\u0303ji ) = \u03b3 h\u0303(\u2217), where \u03b3 \u2208 S\u0393 is such that \u03b3p lies on some\ngeodesic from v to a point of a slice adjacent to S in Cyl(p, h(gi )p). We denote by S\u0393 (i, j) the\nset of such elements \u03b3 \u2208 S\u0393 .\nWe can assume that h\u0303(c\u0303i ) is a geodesic between the images of consecutive markings, but this\nis not essential.\nLemma 3.6 Let v ba a vertex of K of infinite valence, such that {v} is a slice (either parabolic\nor regular) of the cylinder Cyl(p, h(gi )p). Let mji be the marking on ci , associated to the slice\nS = {v}. The diameter of S\u0393 (i, j) in \u0393 (for the word metric) is at most 2000\u03b4(2\u0398 + 1).\n\n20\n\n\fProof : Let \u03b31 and \u03b32 be in S\u0393 (i, j). There are points v1 and v2 in slices S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 adjacent\nto S in Cyl(p, h(gi )p). By Corollary 2.20, |v \u2212 vi | \u2264 1000\u03b4, and for some geodesic segments,\nMaxAng([v, vi ]) \u2264 2\u0398, for i = 1, 2.\nFirst assume that S is a parabolic slice. Then, by the definition of S\u0393 (i, j), S1\u2032 = S2\u2032 . By\nLemma 2.13, Angv ([v, v1 ], [v, v2]) \u2264 14D \u2264 \u0398. Therefore, by the majoration (1), we can deduce\nthat |\u03b31\u22121 \u03b32 | \u2264 2000\u03b4(2\u0398 + 1).\nSecondly assume that S is a regular slice. Then there is no parabolic slice between S1\u2032\nand S2\u2032 . By Lemma 2.18, Angv ([v, v1 ], [v, v2]) \u2264 2\u0398. Therefore, again by the majoration (1),\n|\u03b31\u22121 \u03b32 | \u2264 2000\u03b4(2\u0398 + 1). \u0003\n3.4.3\n\nBounding the lengths of the images of leaves of \u039b in P\u0393\n\nThe equivariant map h\u0303 induces a continuous map h : P \u2192 P\u0393 .\nThe next lemma is an analogue of Lemma II.1 in [Del], but cannot be deduced from it,\nbecause of the presence of parabolic slices.\nLemma 3.7 Let l1 , . . . , lm be a sequence of regular arcs of \u039b, where li links the marking \u03b9(li )\nto the marking \u03c4 (li ), and where \u03c4 (li ) = \u03b9(li+1 ). If the path l1 l2 ...lm has no loop, then the path\nh(l1 l2 ...lm ) in P\u0393 is homotopic, with fixed ends, to a path in the 1-skeleton of P\u0393 , of length less\nthan 20000\u03b4(\u0398 + 1) \u00d7 n (for the graph metric of the 1-skeleton).\nProof : As the arcs are all regular, all the markings involved are associated to the same\nslice of K, say S. Let us lift the path l1 l2 ...lk in a path l1^\nl2 ...lk of P\u0303 , starting at the marking\nj\nj\nf\nf\u0393 is\nm\u0303i , where mi = \u03b9(l1 ). Thus, this path is mapped in P\u0393 on a path that stays in S\u0393 . As P\nsimply connected, this path is homotopic to any path in the 1-skeleton that has the same ends.\nThere are two main cases to study, namely if the slice is regular not reduced to a single\npoint of infinite valence, or if it is reduced to a single point of infinite valence (including the\ncase of parabolic slices). If the second case, we will have to discuss whether an adjacent arc of\nthe lamination is regular or not.\nFirst, if the slice S is regular, not reduced to a parabolic point, then the end points v0\nand vm of h\u0303(l1^\nl2 ...lm ) are vertices of the form v0 = \u03b30 h\u0303(\u2217) for \u03b30 \u2208 S\u0393 , and vm = \u03b3m h\u0303(\u2217) for\n\u03b3m \u2208 S\u0393 . Therefore, there exist s0 and s\u20320 in S and a geodesic segment [s0 , s\u20320 ] in K containing\n\u03b30 p (and similarly for \u03b3m ). By Lemma 2.19, we have a path from \u03b30 p to \u03b3m p of length at most\n3 \u00d7 200\u03b4, and of maximal angle at most 2\u0398. Therefore, by the majoration (1), the distance in\nf\u0393 between v0 and vm is at most 600\u03b4(2\u0398 + 1).\nthe 1-skeleton of P\nSecondly, we assume that S is a parabolic slice or a regular slice reduced to a single vertex\nof infinite valence. Then in the edge containing the marking \u03b9(li ), there is one (and only one,\nif the slice is parabolic) marking m\u03b9,i adjacent to \u03b9(li ) that is not associated to S. In the\nedge containing the marking \u03c4 (li ), there is only one marking m\u03c4,i adjacent to \u03c4 (li ) that is not\nassociated to S, and that is linked to m\u03b9,i by an arc (regular or singular) of the lamination of\nthe triangle or digon. These markings are associated to regular slices (cf Remark 3).\nThere are two possibilities.\nIn the triangle containing li , it is possible that [m\u03b9,i , m\u03c4,i ] is a regular arc of \u039b. Let li0 . . . liq\na maximal subpath such that this property holds at each step. By Lemma 3.6, the end points\nf\u0393 are at distance at most 2000\u03b4(2\u0398 + 1) in the 1-skeleton of P\nf\u0393 .\nof the image of li0 . . . liq in P\nf\u0393 is homotopic with fixed ends, to a path in the 1-skeleton\nTherefore, the image of li0 . . . liq in P\nof length less than 2000\u03b4(2\u0398 + 1).\n\n21\n\n\fAssume now that [m\u03b9,i , m\u03c4,i ] is not a regular arc of \u039b. That is that li is one of the three\nregular leaf of a triangle that is adjacent to a singular leaf. Note that in a path l1 . . . lm without\nloop, this can only happen 3n times, where n is the number of triangles.\nLet S be the slice of the cylinders of the triangle containing li , associated to \u03b9(li ) and \u03c4 (li ).\nLet S\u03b9 be the slice associated to m\u03b9,i , and S\u03c4 be the slice associated to m\u03c4,i .\nIn order to bound the distance between the images of \u03b9(li ) and \u03c4 (li ), it is enough to bound\nthe maximal angle of geodesics between elements of S\u03b9 and S\u03c4 . Let v\u03b9 be in S\u03b9 , v\u03c4 be in S\u03c4 .\nWe claim that, given a geodesic segment [v\u03b9 , v\u03c4 ] in K, its maximal angle is at most 5\u0398.\nIf S is a regular slice, it is the triangular inequality for angles in the two edges of the triangle\nsharing S.\nIf S is parabolic, we consider a segment between v\u03b9 and v\u03c4 that passes through the vertex of\nthe slice S. By Lemma 2.19, it has no angle larger than 2\u0398 except possibly at S, and if its angle\nis larger than 5\u0398 at this point, S would be a parabolic slice of the third side of the triangle. By\nthe construction of the leaves in a triangle, the marking \u03c4 (li ) should be on this side, which is\nnot the case.\nf\u0393 is at\nTherefore, the distance between the images of \u03b9(li ) and \u03c4 (li ) in the 1-skeleton of P\nmost 5\u0398.\nFor a path l1 l2 ...lm without loop, such a situation can happen only 3n times, where n is the\nnumber of triangles. Therefore the distance between the endpoints of its image, in the 1-skeleton\nf\u0393 , is at most 3n \u00d7 (2000\u03b4(2\u0398 + 1) + 5\u0398) + 2000\u03b4(2\u0398 + 1). This is less than 20000\u03b4(\u0398 + 1) \u00d7 n.\nof P\n\u0003\nLemma 3.8 An arc of \u039b linking two markings corresponding to slices in a hole of a same\ntriangle, maps on a path which is homotopic, with fixed ends, to a path in the 1-skeleton of P\u0393 ,\nof length less than (\u03c6(n) + 1) \u00d7 (40000\u03b4(\u0398 + 1)).\nProof : Such an arc is homotopic with fixed ends in P to a path tracking back on the first\nside of the triangle, until the first regular arc to the other side, and then tracking on this side to\nthe suitable marking. By theorem 2.22, this path enters in at most 2 \u00d7 (10\u03c6(n) + 1) slices, none\nof them having an angle superior to 5\u0398. Therefore, by the majoration (1), the distance between\nthe end points of the image is inferior to 2 \u00d7 (10\u03c6(n) + 1) \u00d7 (1000\u03b4(2\u0398 + 1)) in the 1-skeleton\nof the universal cover of P\u0393 . \u0003\n3.4.4\n\nImage of the leaf \u03bb\n\nWe need a lemma from [Del].\nLemma 3.9 ([Del] Lemma III.4)\nLet L be a connected graph, L1 be its 1-skeleton, and E a metric space. Let h : L \u2192 E be a\ncontinuous map. Let E \u2032 be a subset of E. Assume that :\n1) For all edge l in L1 , h(l) is homotopic in E, with fixed ends, to a curve in E \u2032 of length\nless than the constant M .\n2) There exists a finite set of edges L\u20321 \u2282 L1 such that a path without loop, made of consecutive\nedges l1 , . . . , lk in L1 \\ L\u20321 , has its image by h homotopic in E (with fixed ends) to a curve in E \u2032\nof length less than M .\nThen, for all vertex s of L, h\u2217 (\u03c01 (\u039b, s)) is generated by curves in E \u2032 of length inferior to\n(4Card(L\u20321 ) + 3) \u00d7 M .\n\n22\n\n\fProof : Let T be a maximal tree in L. The group h\u2217 (\u03c01 (\u039b, s)) is generated by the images\nof the loops of the form [s, s\u2032 ]e[s\", s], where the segments [s, s\u2032 ] and [s\", s] are in T , and where e\nis an edge from s\u2032 to s\" in L. In particular, the paths [s, s\u2032 ] and [s\", s] do not contain any loop,\nand contain at most Card(L\u20321 ) edges of L\u20321 . Each of those two segments are the concatenation of\nat most Card(L\u20321 ) + 1 segment without loop made of consecutive edges in L1 \\ L\u20321 , with at most\nCard(L\u20321 ) edges of L\u20321 . Therefore the image of [s, s\u2032 ] by h is homotopic in E, with fixed ends, to\na curve in E \u2032 of length less than (2Card(L\u20321 ) + 1) \u00d7 M , and the same is true for the image of\n[s\", s]. Finally, the image of the edge e is homotopic with fixed ends to a curve of E \u2032 of length\nat most M , this gives the result. \u0003\nFinally, we can prove Theorem 3.3. Given a morphism h : G \u2192 \u0393 without accidental\nparabolics, we set E = P\u0393 , E \u2032 its 1-skeleton, and L = \u03bb, the singular leaf of \u039b given by\nCorollary 3.5. We choose L\u20321 to be the set of arcs joining two markings of a hole of a triangle,\nvia the singular point of this triangle, and M = 40000\u03b4(\u03c6(n) + 1)(\u0398 + 1)} (which is superior\nto 20000\u03b4(\u0398 + 1) \u00d7 n). By Lemma 3.7 and Lemma 3.8, the assumptions of the previous lemma\nare fulfilled. We get that h(G) is conjugated to a subgroup of \u0393 generated by curves in the\n1-skeleton of P\u0393 of length bounded by (4 \u00d7 n \u00d7 (30\u03c6(n))2 + 3) \u00d7 M . There are finitely many such\ncurves. Hence, there are finitely many such subgroups, therefore this implies Theorem 3.3. \u0003\n\n4\n\nAppendix : Coarse-piecewise-geodesics are \u03bb-quasi-geodesics.\n\nIn this appendix, we give a simple proof that coarse piecewise geodesics (Definition 2.1) are\n\u03bb-quasi-geodesics (Proposition 4.2). Let K be an hyperbolic graph, and l a constant greater\nthan \u03bc (see section 2 for the constants). Let f : [a, b] \u2192 K be a coarse piecewise geodesic, for\nthe subdivision of [a, b] : a = c1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 . . . \u2264 cn \u2264 dn = b.\nLemma 4.1 Let i be an integer in [1, n]. Let t \u2208 [ci , di ] \u2282 [a, b] be such that |t \u2212 ci | \u2265 4\u01eb and\n|t \u2212 di | \u2265 4\u01eb. Then f (t) is at distance at most 2\u03b4 from a geodesic segment [f (a), f (b)].\nLet us mention that the proof is similar to the one of Lemma 2.17.\nProof : As f |[ci ,di ] is a \u03bc-local geodesic, the restriction f |[(t\u22124\u01eb),(t+4\u01eb)] is a geodesic segment\nwhose ends are at distance at most 2\u01eb from a segment [f (a), f (b)]. Let w1 and w2 be points in this\nsegment realizing the minimal distance to f (t\u22124\u01eb), f (t+4\u01eb). The triangle (f (t\u22124\u01eb), w1 , f (t+4\u01eb))\nand (w1 , w2 , f (t + 4\u01eb)) are \u03b4-thin, therefore, v is at distance at most 2\u03b4 from [w1 , w2 ]. \u0003\nProposition 4.2 Let t1 and t2 be such that a \u2264 t1 < t2 \u2264 b. Then |f (t1 ) \u2212 f (t2 )| \u2265 \u03bb1 |t1 \u2212 t2 |.\nProof : Either there is a number u1 such that |u1 \u2212 t1 | \u2264 5\u01eb and such that u1 satisfies the\nhypothesis of Lemma 4.1, or |a \u2212 t1 | \u2264 5\u01eb (in this case we write u1 = a). In both cases, f (u1 )\nis at distance at most 2\u03b4 from a point v1 in [f (a), f (b)]. Let k be a positive integer such that\nt1 + 1000k\u03bb\u03b4 \u2264 t2 . Then, there exists uk+1 a number such that |t1 + 1000k\u03bb\u03b4 \u2212 uk+1 | \u2264 5\u01eb, and\nsatisfying the hypothesis of Lemma 4.1. Therefore there exists vk+1 on [f (a), f (b)] at distance\nat most 2\u03b4 from f (uk+1 ).\nLet m be the maximal number such that t1 + 1000m\u03bb\u03b4 \u2264 t2 .\nBy definition of coarse-piecewise-geodesics, for all k \u2208 [1, m + 1], f |[uk ,uk+1 ] is a \u03bb2 -quasigeodesic. Therefore, |f (uk ) \u2212 f (uk+1 )| \u2265 \u03bb2 |uk+1 \u2212 uk |. We deduce that |vk \u2212 vk+1 | \u2265 \u03bb2 |uk+1 \u2212\nuk | \u2212 4\u03b4. Therefore, by summing, |v1 \u2212 vm+1 | \u2265 \u03bb2 \u00d7 |um+1 \u2212 u1 | \u2212 4m\u03b4.\nMoreover, |vm+1 \u2212 f (t2 )| \u2264 5\u01eb + 1000\u03bb\u03b4 + 2\u03b4, and |v1 \u2212 f (t1 )| \u2264 5\u01eb + 2\u03b4.
