Both approaches are somewhat unfamiliar to most physicists. In this Letter we continue our investigations using more conventional\nmethods, close to the spirit of Ref. [6].\n\n2\n\nExotic particles with minimal electromagnetic interaction\n\nA curious fact known for thirty years but only investigated in more recent times is that the\nplanar Galilei group admits a two-fold \"exotic\" central extension, labeled with m (the mass) and\na second, \"exotic\" parameter \u03ba [7]. Physical realizations of this symmetry have been presented,\nindependently [8, 9]; both can be obtained from their relativistic anyons as \"Jackiw-Nair\" (JN)\nlimits [10, 11]. The first of these models, referred to as the \"extended exotic particle\", uses an\n\u2217\n\ne-mail: horvathy@univ-tours.fr\ne-mail: Luigi.Martina@le.infn.it\n\u2021\ne-mail: peter@Physik.Uni-Bielefeld.DE\n\u2020\n\n\facceleration dependent Lagrangian [8]. In terms of (external) momenta, Pi , and suitably defined\nexternal and internal coordinates Xi and Qi and (i = 1, 2), [11, 12], the model is conveniently\ndescribed by the first-order Lagrangian\nn\nP~ 2 o n 1\n1 ~ 2o\n\u03b8\n\u01ebij Qi Q\u0307j +\nQ ,\n+\nL0 = L0ext + L0int = Pi * \u1e8ai + \u01ebij Pi \u1e56j \u2212\n2\n2m\n2\u03b8\n2m\u03b8 2\n\n(2.1)\n\n~ 2 is a constant of the motion.\nwhere we introduced the non-commutative parameter \u03b8 = \u03ba/m2 . Q\n~ 2 = 0, the internal space reduces to a point, and we recover the \"minimal\" exotic particle\nWhen Q\nin [9]. We first consider the extended case. Qi = 0. The nontrivial Poisson-bracket relations are\n{Xi , Xj } = \u2212{Qi , Qj } = \u03b8\u01ebij ,\n\n{Xi , Pj } = \u03b4ij .\n\n(2.2)\n\nSuch a particle can be coupled minimally to an electromagnetic field in various ways.\n(i) One possibility [11, 12] is to couple to the external part only by adding the usual expression\n= e(Ai \u1e8ai + A0 ),\nLgauge\next\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich amounts to gauging the global symmetry associated with the electric charge. This amounts\nto modifying the symplectic structure which determines the non-commutative geometry of the\nphase space, cf. (3.5) below.\n(ii) In another scheme [12] the Hamiltonian is\nH0 =\n\n\u00112\n1 \u0010~\nP~ 2\n~ \u2212 eA0\n\u2192\nP \u2212 eA\n2m\n2m\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhile the non-commutative geometry is unchanged. In such a way the interaction changes\nAbelian gauge transformations [12] 1 . The two schemes are equivalent in the absence of the\nexotic structure, \u03b8 = 0, but not for \u03b8 6= 0.\nBoth schemes leave the internal motions uncoupled. They can be also coupled, however, by\ngauging the additional \"internal\" global SO(2) symmetry, \u03b4Qi = \u03c6 \u01ebij Qj \u03c6 \u2208 R [11]. In scheme\n(i) the interaction of an \"extended exotic particle\" with an electromagnetic field is described by\nthe Lagrangian\n+ Lgauge\nL = L0 + Lgauge\next\nint ,\n\nLgauge\n=\nint\n\n~2\nQ\n(Ai \u1e8ai + A0 ).\n2\u03b8\n\n(2.5)\n\nThen easy calculation shows that the Lagrangian (2.5) is quasi-invariant with respect to local\n~ t) \u01ebij Qj , \u03b4A\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6.\ninternal rotations supplemented by a gauge transformation, \u03b4Qi = \u03c6(X,\nThe coefficient\nin othe interaction term (2.5) is fixed by gauge invariance: it generates internal\nn\n2\n~\nrotations, Q , Qi = 2\u03b8\u01ebij Qj .

Equation (2.8) implies at once that\n~ 2 (and hence also the shifted charge) are constants\nthe [squared] length of the internal vector, Q\nof the motion.\n1\n\nYet another coupling scheme is put forward in [13].\n\n\fIn the general case, the \"internal\" variable is parallel transported, just like for a particle with\nnonabelian internal structure [14]. This motion is, however, a mere gauge artifact that could be\neliminated by a gauge transformation with \u03c6(t) = \u2212t/m\u03b8, which would also remove the (m\u03b8)\u22121\n~ 2 . Being unphysical, the motion of the internal variable\nin (2.8). The only physical quantity is Q\n~ will, therefore not be considered in what follows. We only consider the equations (2.6-2.7).\nQ\n~ = 0, we recover the \"minimal\" exotic particle of [9], coupled to an e.m. field.\nWhen Q\nIn the second scheme (ii), the electromagnetic interaction including the internal motion\ncan be obtained, as described in [12], from (2.4) by means of a noncanonical transformation\nof the phase space variables, supplemented with a classical Seiberg-Witten map between the\ncorresponding gauge potential.\nTherefore, in both cases, the additional coupling to internal motion amounts to replacing the\n~ 2 /2\u03b8, whose two parts can't be measured\noriginal, \"bare\" charge by the total charge, e \u2192 e + Q\nseparately.\n\n3\n\nAnomalous coupling\n\nAnomalous coupling to the electromagnetic field has been studied before [3, 6, 15, 16, 17, 18].\nThe traditional rule of nonrelativistic physics, translated into the plane, says that magnetic\nmoment interactions should be introduced by adding a term \u03bcB to the Hamiltonian, where\n\u03bc = egs0 /2m is the magnetic moment. Here g is the gyromagnetic ratio and we denoted nonrelativistic spin by s0 . Here we propose to generalise this rule by also including an electric term,\nnamely by adding to (2.5)\ng\nLanom = \u03bcB \u2212 e\u03b8\u01ebij Pi Ej ,\n2\n\n\u03bc=\n\nge\ns0 .\n2m\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe equations of motion look rather complicated,\n\u0010\n\ng\u0011\nemg\u03b8 2\n(Pi \u2202k Ek \u2212 Pk \u2202k Ei ) ,\nem\u03b8\u01ebij Ej \u2212 \u03bcm\u03b8\u01ebij \u2202j B +\n2\n2\neg\u03b8\n\u01ebkj Pk \u2202i Ej .\n= e(Ei + B\u01ebij \u1e8aj ) + \u03bc\u2202i B \u2212\n2\n\nm\u2217 \u1e8ai = Pi \u2212 1 \u2212\n\u1e56i\n\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n\n\u2022 for g = 0 we plainly recover the previous equations of motion (2.6-2.7-2.8).\n\u2022 By (3.2) the velocity and the momentum, \u1e8ai and Pi , respectively, are not parallel in\ngeneral, except for g = 2 and for constant magnetic and linear and central electric field.\n\u2022 When the fields are not only weak but also constant, eqns.

The generic solutions of the equations of motion (3.4) are of the\nfamiliar cycloidal form describing the Hall drift of the guiding center combined with uniform\nrotations with frequency\neB\n(3.7)\n\u03a9 = \u2217.\nm\nUnlike in [4], the \"corrected\" Larmor frequency only depends on the non-commutative parameter\n\u03b8 but is independent of the gyromagnetic ratio g.\nRemarkably, the same equations (3.4) can be derived also from another Hamiltonian structure, namely from\nnn\n\nXi , Xj\n\nnn\n\nXi , Pj\n\nnn\n\nPi , Pj\n\noo\n\noo\n\noo\n\n=\n\n1 \u2212 (g/2)\n\u03b8 \u01ebij ,\n1 \u2212 e\u03b8B\n\n(3.8)\n\n=\n\n1 \u2212 (g/2)e\u03b8B\n\u03b4ij ,\n1 \u2212 e\u03b8B\n\n(3.9)\n\n=\n\n1 \u2212 (g/2)e\u03b8B\neB \u01ebij\n1 \u2212 e\u03b8B\n\n(3.10)\n\nP~ 2\n+ A0 + \u03bcB.\n2m(1 \u2212 (g/2)e\u03b8B)\n\n(3.11)\n\nH =\n\nThese are indeed the usual \"exotic\" relations, but with redefined NC parameter and mass,\n\u03b8\u2192\n\n1 \u2212 (g/2)\n\u03b8\n1 \u2212 (g/2)e\u03b8B\n\nm \u2192 m(1 \u2212 (g/2)e\u03b8B),\n\n(3.12)\n\nrespectively. Thus, for constant external fields, the anomalous electric coupling term in (3.1)\n(or (3.6)) can be suppressed by redefining the parameters, yielding the same equations (2.6-2.7)\nas in the minimal model. The constant term \u03bcB can actually be dropped from both (3.6) and\n(3.11).\n\n4\n\nRelation to relativistic anyons\n\nThe anomalous theory of Ref. [3] was based on replacing the (relativistic) \"bare\" mass by a fielddependent expression, m \u2192 M = M (eF * S), where S\u03b1\u03b2 is the spin tensor, and F * S = \u2212S\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2\n[15, 16] 2 . Now in the plane the usual requirement S\u03b1\u03b2 P \u03b2 = 0 implies that spin is given by the\nmomentum,\ns\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 P \u03b3 .\n(4.1)\nS\u03b1\u03b2 =\nM\nIn [3] the choice was\nf2 = m2 + ge F * S.\n(4.2)\nM\n2c2\nIt should be stressed, however, that (4.2) is a mere Ansatz, and does not follow from any first\nprinciple. In fact, any function M = M (eF * S) would yield a consistent theory [6, 15, 16]. For\nexample,\nge\nF *S\n(4.3)\nM =m+\n4mc2\ncould be (and has been [17]) used. In the weak-field-limit, (4.3) yields the same equations as\nf \u2248 M if egF * S/m2 c2 << 1. In what follows, we shall use the simpler expression\n(4.2), since M\n(4.3). Then the procedure followed in [3] is readily seen to be equivalent, in the weak-field limit,\n2\n\nGreek indices refer to 2 + 1 dimensional Minkowski space.\n\n\fto adding to Cartan's variational 1-form (whose integral is the classical action [5]) the anomalous\nspin-field term\n\u0012\n\u0013\nP\u03c3 dX \u03c3\nges\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 P \u03b1 F\u03b2\u03b3\n.\n(4.4)\n\u2206\u03b1 = \u2212\n4mM\nM c2\n\nBut we can parametrize our curves with proper time, (P\u03b1 dX \u03b1 )/M c2 = d\u03c4 [3]. The extra term\nhas, therefore, the same effect as adding\nges \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n\u01eb P\u03b1 F\u03b2\u03b3\n4mM\n\n\u2206H =\nto the Hamiltonian, since\n\nZ\n\n\u2206\u03b1 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n(4.5)\n\n\u2206Hd\u03c4 .\n\nIn a local Lorentz frame, putting s = \u03b8m2 c2 + s0 allows us to infer that the extra piece added\nto the Lagrangian is\n+\n\nges0\ngem\u03b8B\nP0 +\nB\n2M\n2m\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nP0\nM c2\n\n\u2212\n\n1 ges0\ngm\ne\u03b8\u01ebij Pi Ej \u2212 2\n\u01ebij Pi Ej .\n2M\nc 2mM\n\nP0 \u2248 M c2 and m/M \u2248 1 in the NR limit. Removing the first, divergent term and dropping the\nlast one which goes to zero as c \u2192 \u221e. In the JN limit, neglecting higher-order terms, we end up\nwith Lanom with Q = 0 in (3.1) 3 . Alternatively, the spin-orbit term Hanom in (3.6) is the JN\nlimit of (4.5). The two possibilities i. e., either changing the kinetic term, or adding a spin-orbit\npiece to the Hamiltonian are the relativistic counterparts of the two Hamiltonian structures we\nfound in the non-relativistic context.\n\n5\n\nSemiclassical Dirac particle\n\nReturning to the non-relativistic setting, let us illustrate our theory on a related problem. In a\nrecent paper [20], B\u00e9rard and Mohrbach consider a 3D Dirac particle in a constant electric field\nand show that, semiclassically, the particle admits, to order c\u22122 , the anomalous velocity relation\nm\n\n1 e\ndXi\n\u2248 Pi \u2212\n\u01ebijk \u03c3j Ek\ndt\n2 mc2\n\n(5.1)\n\n[supplemented with the Lorentz force law \u1e56i = eEi ], where ~\u03c3 is the spin vector. Assuming\ncylindrical symmetry and spin-polarized electrons, \u03c3i = \u2212s\u03b4i3 , the JN limit s/m2 c2 \u2192 \u03b8 yields\nm\n\n1\ndXi\n\u2248 Pi \u2212 em\u03b8\u01ebij Ej ,\ndt\n2\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhich is the first equation in (3.4) with B = 0 and with anomalous gyromagnetic factor g =\n1. This value has already been found before [21]. To leading order in c\u22121 , the relativistic\nHamiltonian behaves as\ne \u2248 mc2 +\nH\n\n~2\nP~ 2\n~ *X\n~ + e ~\u03c3 * (E\n~ \u00d7 P~ ) \u2212\u2192 P \u2212 eE\n~ *X\n~ + 1 e\u03b8\u01ebij Pi Ej .\n\u2212 eE\n2\n2\n2m\n2m c\n2m\n2\n\n(5.3)\n\ne\ncf. (3.6). Note that the naive Hamilton equation, \u1e8ai = \u2202 H/\u2202P\ni , would contain a factor (+1/2)\ninstead of (\u22121/2) in front of the anomalous term in (5.2). The correct coefficient is recovered\nwhen the exotic part is taken into account. Either of the Hamiltonian structures\n\n{Xi , Xj }\u03b1 = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b8\u01ebij ,\n\n{Xi , Pj }\u03b1 = \u03b4ij ,\n\nH\u03b1 =\n3\n\n{Pi , Pj }\u03b1 = 0,\n\n(5.4)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP~ 2\n~ *X\n~ + 1 \u2212 \u03b1 e\u03b8\u01ebij Pi Ej ,\n\u2212 eE\n2m\n2\n\n(5.5)\n\nThe Q 6= 0 case could be studied starting with the \"particle with torsion\" [19].\n\n\fyields indeed the correct equations for any value of the real parameter \u03b1. (3.5)-(3.6) corresponds\nto \u03b1 = 0, and (3.8)-(3.9)-(3.10)-(3.11) corresponds to \u03b1 = 1/2, respectively.\n\n6\n\nFurther generalizations\n\nA slightly modified model is obtained replacing the momentum in (3.1), Pi , by the velocity, \u1e8ai :\ng\nL\u2032anom = \u03bcB \u2212 me\u03b8 \u01ebij \u1e8ai Ej ,\n2\n\n(6.1)\n\nMagnetic moment interaction of such kind has been considered before [18]. Eqn. (6.1) is also\nreminiscent of the interaction of a magnetic moment with an electric charge [22].\nAdding (6.1) to our Lagrangian (2.5) amounts indeed to changing the potentials in (2.6)(2.7)-(2.8) according to A0 \u2192 A\u20320 = A0 + (\u03bc/e)B, Ai \u2192 A\u2032i = Ai \u2212 (mg\u03b8/2)\u01ebij Ej , that yields\nB \u2192 B \u2032 = B + mg\u03b8/2\u2202k Ek , Ei \u2192 Ei\u2032 = Ei + \u03bc/e\u2202i B + mg\u03b8/2\u01ebij \u2202t Ej . Eliminating the momenta\nin the new equations of motion and dropping terms which contain second derivatives of the field,\nwe obtain\nemg\u03b8\ndEj\nd \u0010 \u2217\u2032 \u0011\n+\n\u01ebij (\u1e8aj \u2202k Ek + \u2202t Ej )\nm \u1e8ai = e(B\u01ebij \u1e8aj + Ei ) + \u03bc\u2202i B \u2212 me\u03b8\u01ebij\ndt\ndt\n2\n\n(6.2)\n\nwith the new magnetic field, B \u2032 , replacing B in the new effective mass, m \u2192 m\u2217\u2032 = m(1 \u2212 e\u03b8B \u2032 ).\nFor the sake of comparision, neglecting terms which are higher-order in the fields, from (3.2-3.3),\nwe would get instead\n\u0011\nemg\u03b8 \u0010\ndEj\nd\u0010 \u2217 \u0011\n+\nm \u1e8ai = e(B\u01ebij \u1e8aj + Ei ) + \u03bc\u2202i B \u2212 me\u03b8\u01ebij\n\u01ebij \u1e8ak \u2202k + \u2202t \u2212 \u01ebkj \u1e8ak \u2202i Ej .\ndt\ndt\n2\n\nThis is readily transformed into the form (6.2). In a weak and slowly varying field, the two\nmodels only differ in the form of the effective mass.\nIt is worth remembering that anomalous velocity relations of the type studied here have been\nconsidered in the context of the Anomalous Hall Effect [23] and in the semiclassical theory of\nthe Bloch electron [24]. Equations (2.6)-(2.7), or their \"anomalous\" generalization in constant\nexternal fields, (3.4), is indeed a special case of the more general system\n\u1e8ai + \u03b8(P~ )\u01ebij \u1e56j\n\n= \u2202Pi E,\n\neB\u01ebij \u1e8aj \u2212 \u1e56i = \u2212eEi ,\n\n(6.3)\n(6.4)\n\nwhere E = E0 (P~ ) \u2212 BM(P~ ) is the total energy with E0 and M denoting the Bloch band\nenergy and the magnetization, respectively. These equations can be derived, under quite general\nassumptions, by semiclassical calculations applied to the dynamics of wave packets in a twodimensional crystal [24]. Note that the non-commutative parameter has been promoted to a\nfunction of the momentum [25].\nThe system (6.3-6.4) can actually be reduced to first order equations for the Pi alone,\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n1 \u2212 eB\u03b8(P~ ) \u1e56i = eB\u01ebij \u2202Pj E + eEi ,\n\n(6.5)\n\nthat can be integrated by solving with respect to P1 , say, using the conserved quantity\nC=E\u2212\n\n\u01ebij Pi Ej\n.\nB\n\n(6.6)\n\n\fThus the problem is reduced to quadratures. Note that eqn. (6.5) is actually Hamilton's equation\nfor C as Hamiltonian and Poisson bracket (3.5c) in P -space alone.\nIn conclusion, we mention that another way of introducing anomalous coupling for constant\ne.m. fields has been advocated by us in [4]. There we introduced an \"enlarged\" planar Galilei\ngroup, which incorporates field variables besides space-time. Interestingly, the square of (6.6) is\nproportional to a Casimir of the enlarged symmetry algebra in [4], and anomalous coupling can\nthen be achieved by adding this Casimir to the Hamiltonian.\nAcknowledgement.
