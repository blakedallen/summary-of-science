Introduction\nRW Aur is a classical T Tauri star (CTTS) with an unusually strong and variable emission line spectrum and large\namplitude irregular variations in the brightness as well as\nin the veiling of the photospheric spectrum. The star is a\nresolved triple system (Ghez et al. 1993) with RW Aur A\ndominating the brightness in the optical spectrum. In a\nrecent detailed investigation of RW Aur A (Petrov et al.\n2001, hereafter referred to as Paper I) periodic variations\nin many spectral features were found, with a period within\n2.d 6\u20132.d9. The period was stable over several years of observation. A model of non-axisymmetric magnetically channeled accretion seems to explain most of the observed variations. The asymmetry of the accretion can be caused either by a close, low-mass, invisible companion (Gahm et\nal. 1999), or by a misalignment of the magnetic and rotational axes.\nThe presence of an asymmetric accretion shock at the\nstellar surface should modulate the strengths of the He i\nand He ii emission lines presumably formed in the postshock region (Calvet & Gullbring 1998), while the hot photospheric spot (104 K) below the shock should modulate\nthe brightness of the star. In case of RW Aur A, clear periodic modulations in He i, Fe ii and other emissions were\nobserved (Paper I) which gives a unique opportunity to\nstudy the expected periodic modulation of the brightness.\nIn this paper we search for periodicities in the variations of the brightness and the colours of RW Aur A, usSend offprint requests to: P.P. Petrov; Peter.Petrov@Oulu.Fi\n\u22c6\non leave from the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory\n\ning all the available photometric data collected over three\ndecades.\n\n2. Observational data\nThe data were taken from the catalogue of UBVRI photometry of TTS compiled by Herbst et al. (1994). For\nRW Aur A, the catalogue contains 575 observations in V\nand B\u2013V, and fewer in other colours. The major part of the\ndata are from the Majdanak Observatory (the ROTOR\nprogram by V.S.Shevchenko's group), and from Van Vleck\nObservatory (unpublished), other sources are Kardopolov\n& Filip'ev (1985), Rydgren et al. (1984) and Herbst et\nal. (1983). We also used the photometric data of 1996\u201399,\npresented in Paper I. Since the information about the observational errors is not available in all cases, we adopt\nequal weights for all data. The light curve is shown in\nFig. 1, and the colour-magnitude diagrams are shown in\nFig. 2\nThere is a good correlation between V and the colours\nB\u2013V, V\u2013R and R\u2013I, with the slopes roughly corresponding to the mean law of interstellar extinction. It looks very\nmuch like the result of variable circumstellar extinction.\nNote, however, that for the spectral type of RW Aur A\n(K1\u2013K4 V) the normal photospheric colour B\u2013V should be\n0.m 86\u20131.m05. With AV = 0.m 3 (Paper I) the observed photospheric colour B\u2013V is expected to be within 0.m 95\u20131.m14.\nMost of the observed B\u2013V colours are much bluer. This effect is also known for other CTTS: the stars typically have\nclosest to normal photospheric colours when they are at\nminimum brightness, while becoming overly blue at max-\n\n\f2\n\nP.P. Petrov et al.: Periodic variations in colours of RW Aur\n\nFig. 1. Light curve of RW Aur A from 1965 to 1999\n\nFig. 2. Colour\u2013magnitude diagrams. The direction of reddening is shown in the V versus B\u2013V diagram according to\nthe mean law of interstellar extinction. The UBVR bands\nare in the Johnson system, the I band is in the Cousins\nsystem\n\nimum light (Vrba et al. 1993). This is believed to be due\nto an additional, variable non-photospheric hot continuum\nwhich also accounts for the veiling of the photospheric line\nspectrum. The continuum may belong either to hot photospheric spots at the base of the accretion columns, or\nto plage-like regions of hot gas above the stellar surface.\nThe contribution of the emission lines to the photometric bands also accounts for a part of the excessively blue\ncolours.\n\n3. Time series analysis\n3.1. Feature at P = 2.d 641\nThe compiled data set of RW Aur A is very inhomogeneous. It contains large gaps and several dense subregions. To avoid any complication due to methodological\nartefacts, we selected for frequency analysis the simplest\nstatistic available: the variance of the least squares fit\nresiduals divided by the original variance of the data. As\nthe model to be fitted we used a single harmonic curve\n\u03bc + A cos(2\u03c0twk ) + B sin(2\u03c0twk ), where \u03bc is the mean\nlevel of the light curve and wk , (k = 1, 2, . . . , K) is one of\nthe trial frequencies. The computed row of K variance ratios forms the least squares (LS) frequency spectrum (see\nPelt 1992).\n\nThe overall picture of the time variability of the star in\nthe range of periods 0.8 \u2212 1000 days is presented in Fig. 3.\nFor the channels V, B and U, most of the variability is\nwell concentrated around the zero frequency (the bunch\nof peaks around frequency 1 cyc/day is a result of aliasing\nfrom zero frequency). The relatively small peak at 2.d 641\nin the U band is just the feature we are going to analyse in more detail. As it is well seen from the same figure,\nthe strength of the peak for B\u2013V is significantly amplified,\nand for the U\u2013V colour (computed as (U\u2013B)+(B\u2013V)) the\npeak becomes the strongest in the full range of frequencies. Its statistical significance can be demonstrated using\ndifferent methods. For instance, when we carried out 1000\nMonte-Carlo runs in the range of periods 2\u20133 days, the\nreshuffled data never showed peaks of this strength. For\nthe full displayed range this gives a false alarm probability\nwhich is less than 0.0075. Due to the bad spacing of the\ndata, any more detailed analysis can give only formally\nbetter levels of significance. This is why we tried to test\nthe 2.d 641 feature by using a careful analysis of separate\nsubsets of the full data. The peak at 1.d 609 in U\u2013V (see\n1\n1\n\u2248 1 \u2212 2.641\n), and we\nFig. 3) is a result of aliasing ( 1.609\ndo not consider it further.\n\n3.2. General and specific variability\nFrom the colour-magnitude diagrams (Fig. 2) we can conclude that the total variability of RW Aur A consists of at\nleast two components: general variability (GV), which is a\nlarge-scale variability in all the colours within about 0.m 5,\nand specific variability (SV), which can be best seen in\nthe colour-magnitude diagrams for U\u2013B and B\u2013V, as the\nscatter of the points around the linear trend. This scatter\nis very small in the red colours but steeply increasing towards the UV. Fig. 3 shows that the feature at P = 2.d 641\nbelongs to SV (it is totally absent from the V band). In\norder to investigate the SV more closely, we should eliminate the linear trend in the colour-magnitude diagrams\nand investigate the residual time variations in the colours,\nwhich can be defined as (B\u2013V)res =(B\u2013V)\u2013C*V+const for\nB\u2013V and in a similar way for other colours. Thus, we included an extra term into the LS fit of the harmonics:\n\u03bc + A cos(2\u03c0twk ) + B sin(2\u03c0twk ) + C * V(t), and allowed\ncoefficient C to vary together with the other model parameters \u03bc, A, B. As a result we obtained a new statistic\nfor the period search which allows to optimally separate\nSV from GV.\nThe results of such a procedure can be seen in Fig. 4,\nwhere short fragments of the LS spectra are depicted. One\ncan see that a strong improvement is obtained for the B\u2013V\ncolour. The improvement is even more dramatic in the red\ncolours, where the amplitude of the periodic signal is very\nsmall (SV\u226aGV). The phase diagrams with P = 2.d 641 for\nthe residual variations (U\u2013V)res and (B\u2013V)res are depicted\nin Fig. 5. The scatter is still quite significant so that we\nneed to look at the data in more detail.\n\n\fP.P. Petrov et al.: Periodic variations in colours of RW Aur\n\n3\n\nFig. 3. Least squares spectra for magnitudes and colours. Due to the long time base, the actual spectra contain more\nthan 300000 points each, so that the plot is somewhat schematic. For every pixel of the plot, the minimum and\nmaximum value of the spectra covered by that pixel was computed, and the spectral content for the corresponding\npixel was plotted as a vertical line from minimum to maximum.\n\nFig. 4. Details of the LS spectra around period P = 2.d 641.\nSpecific values of the test statistic (denoted here by D) are\nalso displayed. It is well seen that the peaks are amplified\nin the spectra of the residual variances.\n\n3.3. Stability of the period\nHere, we will focus on the analysis of the residual variation\n(U\u2013V)res . The largest number of observations are concentrated in the following four seasons: 1981\u201382, 1987\u201388,\n1988\u201389 and 1989\u201390. In Fig. 6 we plotted the results of\nthe LS fits of a single harmonic with the period P = 2.d 641\nfor each of the four seasons separately. The scatter for two\nseasons (1981\u201382 and 1988\u201389) is reasonably small, but for\nseason 1987\u201388 it is much larger, and for the last season\n\nFig. 5. The phase diagram for (U\u2013V)res and (B\u2013V)res with\nthe period 2.d 641. The best fit harmonic is also given as a\ncontinuous line.\n\nwith the small number of points it is very high. However,\nthe amplitudes (maximum\u2013minimum) are still significant\n(0.m 33, 0.m 20, 0.m 40, 0.m 15, respectively), especially if compared to the amplitude 0.m 21 of the full data fit (see Fig. 5).\nThere is also a reasonably good phase stability: the phase\nshifts around the full fit phase are 20%, 5.7%, 3.3%, 8.3%,\nrespectively.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 4 the feature around the\nperiod 2.d 641 consists of two main depressions in the LS\nfrequency spectra. The smaller peak right from the main\n\n\f4\n\nP.P. Petrov et al.: Periodic variations in colours of RW Aur\n\nFig. 6. Local fits for (U\u2013V)res with the period 2.641 days.\nThere are 59 points for the 1981\u201382 season, 54 points for\n1987\u201388, 54 points for 1988\u201389, and 27 points for 1989\u201390.\npeak (P = 2.d 639) is a result of a cycle count ambiguity between seasons 1981\u201382 and 1987\u201388. If we computed the LS spectrum for the three subsets from 1981\u2013\n1989 together, ignoring all other data points, the peaks\naround 2.d 641 and 2.d 639 occured to be comparably deep.\nConsequently, the last digit in the value of the accepted\nperiod depends on wildly scattered points outside the\nabove mentioned seasons and must be taken only as the\nbest approximation.\nIn conclusion, we can say that the most prominent\nfeature in the frequency spectrum of the U\u2013V colour is\ncertainly a real regularity which is more or less persistent\nat least during eight years (see Fig. 6).\n\n4. Discussion: Is there a hot spot?\nThe periodic variations of the blue colours are most probably related to the periodicities in the spectral lines discussed in Paper I. The spectroscopic data set used in\nPaper I covered only four years (1996\u20131999), which allowed to find a period within the range 2.d 6 \u2212 2.d 9. The\nperiod of 2.d 77 was selected as the best one for demonstration of the phase diagrams in Paper I, although with\na period of 2.d 64 the diagrams look similar. In this paper,\nusing the much larger time span of the photometric data\nwe confirm the period and prove that it was relatively stable over at least several years. The stability of the period\nprobably excludes the possibility that the periodicity is\ncaused by a local asymmetry in the magnetospheric structure, which is supposed to be a short-lived phenomenon.\nWe still cannot distinguish between the binary hypothesis\nand the hypothesis of the inclined magnetic rotator (misalignment of the magnetic and rotational axes), discussed\nin Paper I.\nThe amplitudes of the periodic colour variations rising steeply towards the UV indicate the presense of a hot\nsource of radiation (hot spot). When the whole data set\nis used, the full amplitudes of the sinusoidal oscillations\nare: 0.m 21 in U\u2013V, 0.m 07 in B\u2013V, and about 0.m 02 in V\u2013R\n\nFig. 7. Phase diagrams with the period 2.d 641. Upper: flux\n(in 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) in the narrow HeI emission. The\nerrors are due to uncertainties in the decomposition of\nthe He i emission profile into the narrow and broad components. Centre: equivalent width of the Na i D1 accretion component. Lower: the residual B\u2013V colour (filled circles: the photometry made simultaneously with the spectroscopy; open circles: the whole set of the photometric\ndata).\n\nand V\u2013I. Using black body approximations for the fluxes\nfrom the photosphere and the hot spot, one can estimate\nthe temperature of the hot spot and the fraction of the\nvisible stellar disc covered by the spot (Vrba et al. 1993).\nWith Tphot =4800 K, and the amplitudes given above, we\nget Tspot =15000 K and the covering fraction 0.1%. Such\na small spot gives only a 0.m 05 amplitude in the V magnitude.\nIn Paper I we presented strong arguments in favour\nof the magnetospheric accretion model. The accelerated\ngas stream(s) flowing toward the star is clearly seen in\nthe red-shifted components of many spectral lines. The\nstrengths of the red-shifted components vary periodically,\nbeing increased considerably at the phase when the accretion stream is in the line of sight. We found that the\nnarrow He i emission varies in correlation with the redshifted accretion components, and concluded that the narrow emission originates from the shock region(s) at the\nbottom of the accretion stream, near the stellar surface.\nThe broad emissions are believed to be formed in the\nglobal magnetosphere of the star. The two relevant phase\ndiagrams are reproduced here with the new period 2.d 641\nand compared to the colour phase diagram (Fig. 7).\nWe might now identify the small hot spot with the\naccretion shock at the stellar surface. Then we would expect the bluer colours when the narrow He i emission is\nstronger. However, from Fig. 7 one can notice that quite\nthe opposite is observed: when the colours are bluer, the\n\n\fP.P.

Fluxes in the narrow and broad components of the\nHe i emission vs. the residual B\u2013V colours.\nflux in the narrow He i emission is lower. This inverse correlation is better seen in the Fig. 8 with the logarithmic\nscale for the flux. The \"normal\" correlation exists between\nthe colour and the broad line flux: the larger the broad line\nflux, the bluer the colour (see also Paper I).\nHence, the colour varies in \"anti-phase\" to the strength\nof the accretion components and to the flux in the narrow\nHe i emission, in the sense that the star is redder when the\nshock region is facing the observer. There is no doubt that\nmagnetospheric accretion is going on in RW Aur A, and\nthat the accretion column(s) exists, but the expected hot\nspot at the base of the accretion column does not reveal\nitself in our series of data. The small hot spot, discussed\nabove, may belong to the non-uniformely distributed hot\ngas, which also radiates in the broad emission lines.\nThe apparent absence of the hot spot related to the\naccretion column is really puzzling. Either the accretion\nshock is absent indeed, or the complicated geometry of\nthe flows and possible extinction of light within the gas\nstreams makes the observed variations so complicated.\nSimultaneous spectroscopic, photometric and polarimetric monitoring of the star could clarify the situation.\nAcknowledgements.
