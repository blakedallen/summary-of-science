The origin of the anomalies is still an open issue. Along with electron-phonon\ncoupling effects, a mechanism involving the formation of an inhomogeneous charge state, also known as stripes 2,3,4,5,6\nhas been discussed7,8 . At the outset let us clarify the anomalies seen in this phonon mode. Earlier works1 focused\non the gradual softening of this mode with doping, a phenomenon seen quite universally in HTCS and now relatively\nwell understood, even theoretically9 on the basis of electron-phonon coupling and screening mechanisms which come\ninto play on doping. This softening can be well described by a cosine-like behaviour of the mode with its minimum\nat the zone boundary. Even in the earliest works, however, there were indications that the dispersion might be\nmore complicated, with deviations from the cosine-like shape7 . The possibility that these deviations are caused by\nstripes has been invoked and adopted in a recent paper10 in which previous data on HTCS, are compared to newer\nones, in particular for La2\u2212x Bax CuO4+\u03b4 with x=1/8. In this system, for x\u223c1/8, an anomalous suppression of the\nsuperconductivity reported in Ref. 11 was later shown to be associated with charge and spin stripe order12,13,14 .\nSignatures of stripes in superconducting samples remain elusive, though it was proposed that stripes are difficult\nto detect in these because they are no longer static15,16 . Using phonons to probe charge fluctuations can potentially lead to a reliable signature of static and dynamic stripes in HTCS. The authors of Ref. 10 in describing their\nhigh resolution inelastic neutron scattering data of the copper-oxygen bond stretching mode, show how one of its\ntwo normally degenerate components follows the expected cosine-like dispersion while the other deviates presenting a\nmuch sharper dip. They interpret this behaviour as a Kohn-like anomaly due to stripes which lift the degeneracy.32\nThis scenario is very intriguing, nevertheless, the dip is not directly visible in the data of Ref. 10, and the authors\ndeduce its existence from a broad shoulder on the low energy side of the Cu-O bond stretching phonon mode. Thus,\nas we show in a recent paper17 , it is desirable to have a direct measurement of the dip since without it, other reasons\ncould be invoked to explain the observed signal. To clarify this point we have carried out a high (Q, \u03c9)-resolution\nmeasurement in La2\u2212x Bax CuO4+\u03b4 using Inelastic X-ray Scattering (IXS), with a comparable energy resolution, but\nwith a higher resolution in reciprocal space compared to previous inelastic neutron scattering experiments.\nThis allowed us not only to confirm the presence of a dip around q= (0.3, 0, 0) in the dispersion of the copperoxygen bond stretching mode, but also to extend this observation to superconducting doping value (x = 0.14). This\ndoping level leads to a stripe-propagation-vector q\u2248 (0.3, 0, 0)6 , in striking agreement with our findings, and supports\na picture based on the interaction with stripes7,10 .\n\n\u2217 matteo.dastuto@impmc.jussieu.fr\n\u2020 Institut\n\nde Min\u00e9ralogie et de Physique des Milieux Condens\u00e9s (IMPMC), CNRS UMR 7590, Campus Boucicaut, 140 rue de Lourmel,\n75015 Paris, France\n\n\f2\n(counts / monitor) x 1000 (arb. un.)\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0.06\n\n2\n\n0.03\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n60\n40\nEnergy (meV)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFIG. 1: Inelastic x-ray scattering example spectrum of La1.86 Ba0.14 CuO4+\u03b4 , at Q= (3.11, 0.04, 0).

In the inset we\nzoom on to the high energy optical Cu-O bond stretching mode. Anti-Stokes modes are not visible because of the unfavorable\ndetailed balance at low temperature.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nWe studied a single crystal of La2\u2212x Bax CuO4+\u03b4 grown from the melt in an image furnace by the traveling solvent\nzone method, under a pressure of 3 bar oxygen. The measured Tc = 18.1 K with \u2206Tc = 7 K defined as the temperature\nrange from 90% to 10% of the maximum Meissner signal, is consistent with micro-probe results indicating a content\nof x = 0.14 \u00b1 0.0118 . The experiment was carried out at the IXS beamline II (ID28) at the European Synchrotron\nRadiation Facility in Grenoble. The sample was mounted in reflection geometry, on the cold finger of a closed-loop\nhelium cryostat, in order to kept it at constant temperature T = (17.8 \u00b1 0.5)K during the experiment. The low\ntemperature was chosen so as to optimize the signal of the high energy modes over the tails of low energy ones.\nThe sample c crystal axe was perpendicular to the scattering plane. We consider the tetragonal unit cell with \u03b1 =\n\u03b2 = \u03b3 = 90\u25e6 and the axes a and b along the Cu-O bond. The sample was aligned along (H,0,0), and we refined\nthe parameter a=3.792 \u00b1 0.001 \u00c5, according to the \u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b8 scan on the (4, 0, 0) reflection, and adopted the value\nof c = 13.235 \u00c5. The rocking curve at the (4,0,0) reflection had a FWHM \u223c 0.06\u25e6 , indicating a very low mosaic\nspread in the small volume probed. The IXS multi-analyzer spectrometer19,20 configurations chosen were of type\nQ = G + q= (3, 0, 0) + (qx , qy , 0), with simultaneous measurements from 7 analyzers. We collected data from the first\n5 analyzers closer to the beam direction, which are at fixed angular spacing of \u223c 0.75\u25e6 (qx \u223c \u00b1 0.07), with the third\none in longitudinal condition qy = 0 while for the others qy \u2264 \u00b1 0.045. This setup corresponds to the 3rd extended\nBrillouin Zone, where the zone center \u0393 is at (4,0,0) and the extended zone boundary at (3,0,0). The standard or\nfolded zone boundary is at the point M=(3.5, 0, 0). The scattering vector resolution was set using a slit opening in\nfront of the analyzers of h \u00d7 v = 20 \u00d7 60 mm corresponding to a solid angle of \u03b4\u03b8 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03be = 0.19\u25e6 \u00d7 0.57\u25e6. The resolution\nin the reciprocal space for 0.6968 \u00c5 wave-length was (\u00b1\u03b4qx , 0, 0) with \u03b4qx \u2248 0.009. The high energy resolution is\nobtained using the back-scattering silicon monochromator aligned along the (1 1 1) direction21,22 . In the present\nexperiment we choose to work with the Si (9 9 9) reflection order, with a wave-length of 0.6968 \u00c5(17794 eV) and an\nenergy resolution \u2206E = 3.0 \u00b1 0.2 meV. An example of a raw IXS spectrum is given in Fig. 1. The energy scans were\nfitted using a sum of pseudo-Voigt for elastic and resolution-limited inelastic contributions, with parameters fixed to\nmatch the instrumental function, while a Lorentzian line-shape was used to fit modes with an intrinsic width larger\nthan the instrumental resolution. In order to assign the measured phonon modes, we performed a lattice dynamical\ncalculation using a computer code23 based on a shell model24 . More details on analysis and simulation are described\nelsewhere17 .\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe high energy portion of some typical measurements is shown in Fig. 2. In this spectral window, at least two\nmodes could be identified: a mode at about 60 meV, corresponding to the 5th longitudinal optic mode (in order from\nthe lowest energy), and a second dispersing from about 90 meV down to about 70 meV, the highest (6th) energy\nlongitudinal Cu-O bond-stretching (or half breathing) optic mode. The fast downward dispersion is accompanied by\na rapid broadening from 5 meV to about 15 meV FWHM. This mode is doubly degenerate, and could eventually\n\n\f3\n\nqx=0.11\n\n3e-05\n\n3e-05\n\n2e-05\n\n2e-05\n\n1e-05\n\n1e-05\n\n0\n\n0\n\ncounts / monitor (arb. un.)\n\nqx=0.21\n\n2e-05\n1e-05\n0\n\nqx=0.32\n\n2e-05\n1e-05\n0\n\nqx=0.39\n\n2e-05\n\n2e-05\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n80\n\n60\n\n0\n10\n\n80\n\n0\n\n1e-05\n\n60\n\n1e-05\n\nE (meV)\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Inelastic X-ray scattering example spectra from La1.86 Ba0.14 CuO4+\u03b4 , at different wave-vectors\nQ= (3 + qx , qy , 0) (see text). In the left column the data are fitted using the degenerate Cu-O bond stretching mode hypothesis. In the right column the data are fitted supposing two Cu-O bond stretching mode.\n\nsplit if the local symmetry is lowered by some anisotropy. Such splitting has been suggested10 for a qx \u223c 0.2 - 0.3,\ncorresponding to the propagation vector of a charge modulation (\"stripe\"). Other possible origins of the double modes\nhave been previously reported7,25 always in connection with microscopic phase-separation. The doubling of the modes\ncan contribute to the observed broadening if the energy resolution is not enough to distinguish the two modes as in\nour case. In most of the measured spectra it is then not possible to have independent fitted parameters for frequency,\nintensity and width of each mode. We have used the error estimation of the fitted widths as a goodness of fit criterion\nand only in the case of qx = 0.32 (see Fig. 2), the two mode fit appears to be better than the single mode fit for our\ndata.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the results of our fitting for the frequencies (left panel) and width (right panel) for the single\nmode (blue circles). A minimum at qx = 0.32 \u00b1 0.04 is clearly observed. In the same figure, we also show the results\nfor the fit in a double mode hypothesis (red squares), for qx = 0.32.\nThe difficulty of the analysis (the impossibility of reliably fitting two closely placed peaks) is inherent to the\nexperimental strategy chosen: in order to follow in detail the dispersion we chose a higher Q-resolution with comparable\nenergy resolution to Ref. 10. This also results in a significantly different line-shape. In Ref. 10, using inelastic neutron\nscattering, the highest mode appears more intense because it is weakly dispersing, and thus benefits from a large Q\nintegration, while the low energy one appears broader because the supposed Kohn-like dip in the dispersion is only\nas large as the experimental Q-resolution. Assuming that the two-mode hypothesis is valid let us examine the\nconsequences for our data. A Q-resolution narrower than the dip width results in a sharper low energy mode. We\nhave already seen that the intensity of the high energy mode decreases due to the better Q-resolution.

Returning to the\nresults shown in Fig. 3, in a one mode hypothesis, we obtain a maximum of the width around qx \u223c 0.3, coinciding\nwith the dispersion minimum. Indeed, even a one peak fit gives a well pronounced anomalous dip that is inconsistent\nwith a cosine-like dispersion. The dip is observed even with a one peak fit because the dispersion of the concerned\nmode and its intensity are strong enough and dominate even after averaging with the less dispersing higher energy\nmode. The maximum in the width is, in fact, a measure of the energy distance between the modes which is associated\nwith the dip, as already pointed out (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 10). Note that we extended the observation of this anomaly\nto a doping range which is well beyond the singular 1/8th level and crucially in a superconducting range where the\nstripes should be dynamic. Consistent with this higher doping level we observe that the dip is more spread out over\nthe BZ, already starting at qx \u2248 0.1 with a FWHM of 4.7 \u00b1 0.3 meV and that the softening is reduced even in the\ntwo mode hypothesis. These observations are thus consistent with a persisting anomaly at the stripe propagation\nwave-vector in a more metallic system, where both the doubling and the shift of the low energy mode appear to be\nreduced. Previous results obtained by IXS26 on La2\u2212x Srx CuO4+\u03b4 for different doping level are interpreted in the\nstandard cosine-like dispersion picture, but corresponds to a set-up with only \u2248 6 meV resolution, about twice the\npresent one. A review of this anomaly in other HTCS is reported in Ref. 10. Finally, we note here that a possible\nlink has recently been suggested in single layer Bi2 Sr1.6 La0.4 Cu2 O6+\u03b4 27 between the maximum of the Cu-O bond\nstretching softening and width, and a Fermi surface nesting vector at qx \u22480.22, with a clear kink in the electron\ndispersion at the energy of the phonon mode. The vector is close to the stripe propagation vector in double layer\nBi2\u2212x Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 reported by STM in Ref. 28 and very recently in single layer Bi2\u2212y Pby Sr2\u2212z Laz Cu2 O6+x 29 .\nThis correlation suggests that stripes are closer to the classical charge-density-wave, which in fact fully develops in\nothers systems as bismuthates, with similar effects on the Bi-O bond stretching modes30 . In order to confirm this\nhypothesis, however, further investigations, similar to the one of Ref. 27, on others systems and dopings are required.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe directly observe a sharp dip in the dispersion of the Cu-O bond-stretching or half-breathing mode at the wavevector qx \u223c 0.3 associated with the stripe propagation-vector, as previously suggested in Ref. 10. Our data are\nconsistent with the two mode hypothesis, which would describe this softening as associated with a doubling of the\nmode, possibly due to a splitting of the doubly degenerate Cu-O bond-stretching mode10 . Our observation shows that\nthe effect persists in a superconducting system close to optimal doping.\n\n\f5\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge D. Gambetti for technical help.

The wave vector related to this effect is given by a nesting vector of the Fermi surface31 . In the case of a stripe related\nanomaly, the difference is that stripes are supposed to originate from strong on-site coulomb repulsion5 and are not linked\nto the Fermi surface topology.\n\n\f"}
