For velocity coupling and for local (position) coupling the reduced\ndynamics of the particle induces superselection rules for the momentum, if the Boson\nfield is infrared divergent. Thereby the Hamiltonian of the total system remains\nbounded from below.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDecoherence and superselection rules are the basis to understand how classical physics can\nemerge within quantum theory. The mathematical structure of quantum mechanics and of\nquantum field theory provides only a few superselection rules, the most important being\nthe charge superselection rule related to the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic field,\nsee e.g. [16] and the references therein. But there are definitively not enough of these\nsuperselection rules to understand the classical appearance of the world within quantum\ntheory. A possible solution of this problem is the emergence of superselection rules due to\ndecoherence caused by the interaction with the environment [9].\nWe investigate the dynamics of a particle which is linearly coupled to a Boson field.\nThe Hamiltonian of the total system is bounded from below. This talk concentrates on\na specific aspect of decoherence: decoherence due to infrared divergence of the Boson\nfield. In the case of velocity coupling the infrared divergence induces a superselection\nrule for the momentum with uniform estimates for the emergence of the superselection\nsectors [12]. For the model with local coupling the infrared divergence also causes a strong\ndecoherence between states of different momenta, but the superselection sectors are not\nuniformly induced. In this talk only some indications are given about how these results\ncan be derived. The detailed calculations will be published in [13].\nThe models considered here have quadratic Hamiltonians, and they can be solved\nin an explicit way. Despite of their unrealistic simplicity such Hamiltonians have been\nsuccessfully used to construct heat bath models [7] and for understanding the approach\nto thermal equilibrium [3] [4], or for calculating decoherence effects due to radiation [5].\nThe structure of quadratic Hamiltonians is therefore rich enough for obtaining interesting\nresults.\n\n2\n\nThe models\n\nWe consider a massive spinless particle coupled to a Boson field of mass zero. The method\npresented here can be applied to a particle in Rd with d \u2265 1. But to simplify the notations\nwe restrict ourselves to one dimension.

The Hamiltonian without interaction between the particle and the field,\nH(0) =\n\n\u0001\n1\nP 2 + \u03c9 2 Q 2 \u2297 IF + IS \u2297 H F\n2\n\n(1)\n\nis the sum of the Hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator or free particle (\u03c9 = 0) on the\nHilbert space L2 (R) and the Hamiltonian HF of a free field on the Fock space F(H0 ). As\ninteraction we take\n\u2013 a velocity coupling HP = P \u2297 \u03a6(h) without harmonic force (\u03c9 = 0),\n\u2013 a local interaction HQ = Q \u2297 \u03a6(h) together with a harmonic force (\u03c9 > 0),\nwhere \u03a6(h) is the Boson field operator smeared with a suitably chosen test function h.\nFor these quadratic Hamiltonians the field equations are linear and can be solved explicitly.\nTo investigate the reduced dynamics we use the Heisenberg picture and take the algebra\ngenerated by the Weyl operators as algebra of observables.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nWeyl operators and classical phase space\nQuantum mechanics of the particle\n\nAs Hilbert space of the particle we take HS = L2 (R). The Weyl operators are defined as\nexponentials of the canonical variables, the position operator Q and the momentum operator P , as WS (a, b) = exp i (aP + bQ) with the parameters (a, b) \u2208 R2 . In the momentum\nrepresentation on the Hilbert space L2 (R) the Weyl operators are given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni\nab + iak f (k \u2212 b).\n(2)\n(WS (a, b)f ) (k) = exp\n2\nFrom this identity follows that the arguments (a, b) \u2208 R2 can be interpreted as the position\nand the momentum variables of the classical phase space of the particle. The closure of the\nlinear span of Weyl operators with the operator norm is the Weyl algebra. This algebra is\nsmaller than the algebra of all bounded operators on L2 (R). But the closure of the Weyl\nalgebra with respect to the weak or the strong operator topology includes all bounded\noperators.\n\u0001\nFor a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian H = 12 P 2 + \u03c9 2 Q2 ,\n\u03c9 > 0, and unitary group U (t) = exp(\u2212iHt) the time dependence of the canonical variables\nis U + (t)P U (t) = P cos \u03c9t \u2212 Q\u03c9 sin \u03c9t and U + (t)QU (t) = P \u03c9 \u22121 sin \u03c9t + Q cos \u03c9t. The\ndynamics of the Weyl operators then follows as U + (t)WS (a, b)U (t) = WS (a(t), b(t)) with\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\na(t)\na\ncos \u03c9t\n\u03c9 \u22121 sin \u03c9t\n= R(t)\n, R(t) =\n(3)\nb(t)\nb\n\u2212\u03c9 sin \u03c9t\ncos \u03c9t\nwhere R(t) is a group of rotations on R2 . For \u03c9 \u2192 +0 the transformations R(t) have a well\ndefined limit, which corresponds to the dynamics P (t) = P (0) = P and Q(t) = Q(0) + P t\nor a(t) = a + bt and b(t) = b of a free particle.\n\n3.2\n\nField operators\n\nspace for the Boson\nfield is H0 = L2 (Rn ) with inner product hf | gi =\np\nRThe basic Hilbert\nf (k)g(k)dn k and norm kf k = hf | f i. The\nM is the one-particle Hamilton\n\u221a operator P\noperator (M f ) (k) = \u03c9(k) f (k) with \u03c9(k) = k2 , k2 = n\u03bc=1 k\u03bc2 , k = (k1 , ..., kn ) \u2208 Rn .\n2\n\n\fThe operator M and its inverse M \u22121 are unbounded operators. To define real vectors we\nintroduce the involution f \u2217 (k) := f (\u2212k). The operator M is a real operator (M f )\u2217 = M f \u2217\nwith respect to this involution.\nThe one-particle space H0 generates the Fock space F(H0 ). Let us denote with f \u25e6 g\nthe symmetric tensor product. Then the normalizations of the Fock space F(H0 ) are\nchosen such that the inner product of exponential vectors exp f = 1vac + f + 12 f \u25e6 f +\n... \u2208\u0010F(H0 ), f \u2208\n\u0011 H0 , is hexp f | exp gi = exp hf | gi. The normalized exponential vector\n2\n1\nexp f \u2212 2 kf k , f \u2208 H0 , is usually called a coherent state. We use the notation \u03c3(f )\nfor the projection operator onto that state.\nThe creation operators: a+ (h), h \u2208 H0 , are uniquely defined by a+ (h) exp f := h \u25e6 exp f ,\n+\nand the annihilation operators a(h), h \u2208 H0 are the adjoint operators a(h) = (a+ (h)) .\nThese operators are normalized to [a(f ), a+ (g)] = hf | gi.\nThe Hamilton operator HF of the free field is uniquely determined by HF exp f = M f \u25e6\nexp f . The Hilbert space of real vectors f = f \u2217 \u2208 H0 , is denoted by HR . It is convenient\nto introduce a test function space ER \u2282 HR on which arbitrary powers of M are defined,\nER = {f \u2208 HR | M n f \u2208 HR , n = \u22121, 0, 1, ...}. For real test functions f \u2208 ER we define the\nfield operator \u03a6(f ) and the conjugate momentum field \u03a0(f )\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n1\n\u03a6(f ) := \u221a12 a+ (M \u2212 2 f ) + a(M \u2212 2 f )\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(4)\n1\n1\n\u03a0(f ) := i [H, \u03a6(f )] = \u221ai2 a+ (M 2 f ) \u2212 a(M 2 f )\n\nsee e. g. [10]. These fields are self-adjoint and they satisfy the canonical commutations\nrelations [\u03a6(f ), \u03a6(g)] = [\u03a0(f ), \u03a0(g)] = 0 and [\u03a6(f ), \u03a0(g)] = i hf | gi . From these definitions follows that the arguments of the canonical fields \u03a0(u) and \u03a6(v) can be extended\nto vectors u \u2208 H\u22121R and v \u2208 H1R , where H\u00b11R are the real Hilbert spaces with the inner\nproducts hf | gi\u00b11 = f | M \u22131 g . The spaces H1R and H\u22121R are dual spaces with respect\nto the inner product hf | gi of HR .\nThe Hamiltonians M and HF generate the unitary groups U0 (t) = exp(\u2212iM t) on H0\nand UF (t) = exp(\u2212iHF t) on F(H0 ).

Moreover, in the van Hove model and\nin our model the mean Boson number diverges due to the soft Bosons. As a consequence\nof this infrared catastrophe the selection rule of the momentum of the particle becomes a\nsuperselection rule [12]. Here we want to understand this effect with the help of the flow\non the classical phase space.

But the identities\n(20) remain meaningful under the weaker condition M \u22121 h \u2264 1. If the low energy\n3\ncontributions in h are strong enough such that h \u2208\n/ D(M \u2212 2 ), there is a qualitative change\nin the time evolution: the Hamiltonian (18) is no longer unitarily equivalent to the free\nHamiltonian, and the norms\nku(t)k\u22121 = b2 (I \u2212 cos M t)M \u22122 h\nkv(t)k1 = b2 (sin M t)M \u22121 h\n\n3\n\n\u22121\n1\n\n= b2 (I \u2212 cos M t)M \u2212 2 h\n3\n\n= b2 (sin M t)M \u2212 2 h\n\n(21)\n\ndiverge for t \u2192 \u221e if b 6= 0. As a consequence the decoherence function decreases to zero\nin both the cases: an environment given by coherent states (15) and an environment given\nby a thermal state (16).

If b = 0 the\nrelations (14) and (20) imply \u03a6t [WS (a, b = 0)] = WS (a, b = 0).\nLet L2 (R) be the Hilbert space of the particle in the momentum representation. For\nany interval I \u2282 R of the real line we denote with P(I) the projection operator, which\nmaps L2 (R) into L2 (I), i.e. f (x) \u2208 L2 (R) is mapped onto (P(I)f ) (x) = f (x) if x \u2208 I, and\n(P(I)f ) (x) = 0 if x \u2208\n/ I.

Moreover any linear combination A = c\u0001j WS (aj , bj )\nof Weyl operators satisfies an estimate kP(I2 )\u03a6t [A] P(I1 )k \u2264 CA exp \u2212\u03b42 \u03c6(t) with some\nconstant CA .
