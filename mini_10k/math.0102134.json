Introduction.\nLet A denote a C*-algebra. In the C*-algebra literature a two-sided ideal, J, of A is called\nessential if aJ = {0} implies a = 0. Given a category and an object X contained in an\nobject Y, then Y is called an essential extension of X provided that every morphism of Y\nthat restricts to be an isomorphism of X must necessarily be an isomorphism of Y. In this\npaper we study the relationships between these two different approaches to essentiality as\nwe vary the category.\nEvery left ideal can be regarded as an object in the category of operator left A-modules,\nwith morphisms either the completely contractive or completely bounded left A-module\nmaps. Thus, it is interesting to know the relationships between an ideal J being essential\nin A, in the C*-algebraic sense, and A being an essential extension of J in these categories.\nFor two-sided ideals we show that all three concepts coincide. Moreover, these conditions\nare equivalent to the injective envelopes, I(J) and I(A), being completely isometrically\nisomorphic via a map that restricts to be the identity on J.\nHowever, for left ideals these concepts differ. It is still true that if I(J) and I(A) are\ncompletely isometrically isomorphic via a map that restricts to be the identity on J, then J\nis an essential left ideal in A. But the converse does not necessarily hold.\nIn this paper, we characterize the essential left ideals of A via their properties as modules\nin the above categories. We also give some characterizations of the left ideals for which A is\nan essential extension in some of these categories in C*-algebraic terms. But there are some\ncategories for which we are unable to give C*-algebraic characterizations of these families of\nleft ideals.\nAs in the earlier work of M. Frank and the second author [5], we find that when the\nmorphisms are the completely contractive maps, then our questions reduce to the case of\ncompletely positive maps and rely mostly on the earlier results of M. Hamana. However,\nwhen the morphisms are taken to be the completely bounded maps or in the case of onesided ideals, then we are dealing with a completely isomorphic situation which requires new\ntechniques or the recent results of [5] and [3].\nTwo of M. Hamana's original characterizations of the injective envelope I(A) of A were as\nthe minimal injective object containing A and as a maximal essential extension of A in the\ncategory of operator systems and completely positive maps. In the work of M. Frank and\nthe second author [5], it was shown that I(A) could also be characterized as the minimal\ninjective containing A in the category of operator left A-modules and completely bounded\nmaps. Completing this set of ideas we show that I(A) can also be characterized as the\nmaximal essential extension of A in this latter category.\nThroughout this paper, C*-algebras are not necessarily unital. In Section 3 we cite a result\nof [5] where 'unital' is assumed. But as is remarked there, many results, including this one,\nfollow in the case of a non-unital C*-algebra A, by taking its minimal unitization A1 and\nobserving that A-modules are naturally A1 -modules.\n2. Definitions.\nWe begin by recalling a remark from [5]. When dealing with a category whose morphisms\nare vector spaces of bounded linear maps, then requiring that an object is injective only\n\n\fCHARACTERIZATIONS OF ESSENTIAL IDEALS AS OPERATOR MODULES OVER C*-ALGEBRAS 3\n\nguarantees that every bounded linear map has a bounded extension, but not necessarily of\nthe same norm. When we want to insist that extensions also have the same norm, then we\nshall refer to the objects as tight injectives. It is easy to see that tight injectivity is equivalent,\nby scaling, to requiring that every contractive linear map has a contractive linear extension.\nThus tight injectivity is the same as saying that the object is injective in a category where\nthe morphisms are all contractive linear maps. Throughout this paper we shall refer to\nsituations as tight, or simply omit the word tight, instead of constantly referring to a change\nof categories. But of course, both viewpoints are useful.\nWe start with definitions of several notions many of which are already known, but perhaps\nnot in our particular setting.\nDefinition 2.1. Let A and B be operator algebras.\n(1) An operator A \u2212 B-bimodule X is an operator space which is also an A \u2212 B-bimodule\nwith k(alm )(xlm )k \u2264 k(alm )kk(xlm )k and k(xlm )(blm )k \u2264 k(xlm )kk(blm )k \u2200(xlm ) \u2208 Mn (X),\n\u2200(alm ) \u2208 Mn (A), \u2200(blm ) \u2208 Mn (B), \u2200n \u2208 N. If A (resp., B) contains identity 1A (resp., 1B ),\nwe always assume that \u2200x, 1A x = x (resp., \u2200x, x1B = x) We also say an operator left Amodule (resp., operator right A-module, operator A-bimodule) for an operator A\u2212C-bimodule\n(resp., operator C \u2212 A-bimodule, operator A \u2212 A-bimodule).\n(2) A (resp., tight) A \u2212 B-rigid extension of an operator A \u2212 B-bimodule X is a pair (Y, \u03b9)\nof an operator A\u2212B-bimodule Y and a completely bounded isomorphism1 (resp., a complete\nisometry) \u03b9 : X \u2212\u2192 Y which is also an A \u2212 B-bimodule map, such that the identity map on\nY is the only completely bounded (resp., completely contractive) A \u2212 B-bimodule map on\nY which fixes each element of \u03b9(X).\n(3) A (resp., tight) A \u2212 B-essential extension of an operator A \u2212 B-bimodule X is a\npair (Y, \u03b9) of an operator A \u2212 B-bimodule Y and a completely boundedly isomorphic (resp.,\ncompletely isometric) A \u2212 B-bimodule map \u03b9 : X \u2212\u2192 Y such that for any operator A \u2212\nB-bimodule W and for any completely bounded (resp., completely contractive) A \u2212 Bbimodule map \u03c6 : Y \u2212\u2192 W , \u03c6 is a completely bounded isomorphism (resp., a complete\nisometry) whenever \u03c6|\u03b9(X) is. If there is no proper embedding of Y by a completely boundedly\nisomorphic (resp., completely isometric) A \u2212 B-bimodule map into any (resp., tight) A \u2212 Bessential extension of X (or, equivalently, there is no proper (resp., tight) A \u2212 B-essential\nextension of Y ), then we say (Y, \u03b9) is a maximal (resp., tight) A \u2212 B-essential extension of\nX.\n(4) An operator A \u2212 B-bimodule W is (resp., tight) A \u2212 B-injective, if for any operator\nA \u2212 B-bimodules Y and Z with Y \u2282 Z (Y has a matrix norm and a module action inherited\nfrom Z) any completely bounded A \u2212 B-bimodule map Y \u2212\u2192 W extends to a completely\nbounded A \u2212 B-bimodule map Z \u2212\u2192 W (resp., preserving the completely bounded norm).\n(5) A (resp., tight) A \u2212 B-injective extension of an operator A \u2212 B-bimodule X is a\npair (Y, \u03b9) of an operator A \u2212 B-bimodule Y and a completely boundedly isomorphic (resp.,\ncompletely isometric) A\u2212B-bimodule map \u03b9 : X \u2212\u2192 Y with Y (resp., tight) A\u2212B-injective.\n(6) An A \u2212 B-injective envelope of an operator A \u2212 B-bimodule X is a pair (Y, \u03b9) of an\noperator A\u2212B-bimodule Y and a complete isometric A\u2212B-bimodule map \u03b9 : X \u2212\u2192 Y with\nY a minimal tight A \u2212 B-injective operator A \u2212 B-bimodule containing \u03b9(X) (i.e. for any\n1\n\nA one-to-one completely bounded linear map whose inverse \u03b9(X) \u2212\u2192 X is also completely bounded.\n\n\f4\n\nMASAYOSHI KANEDA* AND VERN IVAL PAULSEN*\n\ntight A \u2212 B-injective operator A \u2212 B-bimodule Z with \u03b9(X) \u2282 Z \u2282 Y , necessarily Y = Z\nholds, where Z has a matrix norm and a module action inherited from Y .). We denote this\nY by I(X). Frequently we identify X with \u03b9(X) and regard it as X \u2282 I(X).\nIn the above (2), (3), (5), and (6), often we simply write Y for (Y, \u03b9).\nRemark 2.2. (1) There are still some difficulties involved in trying to define injective\nenvelopes in the non-tight setting. In (6) above we really are defining injective envelopes\nonly in the tight setting.\n(2) The following is a well-known argument ([8]). Let A and B be C*-algebras. For any\noperator A \u2212 B-bimodule, take any tight A \u2212 B-injective extension (Y, \u03b9) of X 2 . Given a\nminimal \u03b9(X)-projection on Y 3 , then it follows that \"(Y, \u03b9) is an A \u2212 B-injective envelope\nof X \u21d0\u21d2 Y is the range of a minimal \u03b9(X)-projection on some A \u2212 B-injective operator\nA \u2212 B-bimodule containing \u03b9(X)\". In particular, for any operator A \u2212 B-bimodule X, its\ntight A \u2212 B-injective envelope exists.\n(3) When A and B are C*-algebras, as is proved in Corollary 2.6 in [3], an operator A \u2212 Bbimodule is tight A \u2212 B-injective if and only if it is C \u2212 C-injective, and also when X is\nan operator A \u2212 B-bimodule, Y is an A \u2212 B-injective envelope of X if and only if Y is a\nC \u2212 C-injective envelope of X. For this reason, when X is an operator A \u2212 B-bimodule we\nfrequently call I(X) just an injective envelope of X. Also this fact justifies that we use the\nsimple notation I(X) without mentioning A and B.\n3. Essential extensions with module actions.\nIn this section we obtain the necessary characterizations of injective envelopes as maximal essential extensions. In the tight situation, these are basically restatements of results\nof M. Hamana. However, in the non-tight situation, these characterizations rely on recent\nwork of M. Frank and the second author ([5]) which extends Hamana's rigidity results to\ncompletely bounded module maps. Analogous results to the known results in the category\nof modules over a ring (Theorem 2.10.20 in [14]) were obtained by M. Hamana in the cases\nof Banach modules, C*-algebras, operator systems and operator spaces ([6], [7], [8], [9]).\nWithout any intrinsic changes in his proofs, similar results hold for the case of operator\nmodules over C*-algebras. We summarize the key facts below.\nTheorem 3.1. Let A, B be C*-algebras, and X an operator A \u2212 B-bimodule. Then the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(i) (Y, \u03b9) is a maximal tight A \u2212 B-essential extension of X,\n(ii) (Y, \u03b9) is a tight A \u2212 B-injective and tight A \u2212 B-essential extension of X,\n(iii) (Y, \u03b9) is an A \u2212 B-injective envelope of X,\n(iv) (Y, \u03b9) is a tight A \u2212 B-injective and tight A \u2212 B-rigid extension of X.\nMoreover, such Y is complete.\n2\n\nSuch an extension exists even if X is an operator A\u2212B-bimodule, since X can be considered as X \u2282 B(H)\nfor some Hilbert space H by the representation theorem for operator modules ([4], [2], [3]) and B(H) is a\ntight A \u2212 B-injective by the bimodule version of G. Wittstock's extension theorem (Theorem 4.1 in [19]. See\nalso [15].).\n3\nThe existence of a minimal projection can be shown in the same way as [8].\n\n\fCHARACTERIZATIONS OF ESSENTIAL IDEALS AS OPERATOR MODULES OVER C*-ALGEBRAS 5\n\nProof. First, we suppose that X is an operator A \u2212 B-bimodule.\nThat (ii)\u21d0\u21d2(iii)\u21d0\u21d2(iv) immediately follows from the operator module over C*-algebra\nversion of Lemma 2.11 in [9], but this result relies on several earlier results. For the convenience of the reader, we also include an outline of the proof of this part.\n(ii) =\u21d2 (iii): We only need to show minimality of Y . Let Z be a tight A \u2212 B-injective\noperator A \u2212 B-bimodule such that \u03b9(X) \u2282 Z \u2282 Y . Then idZ extends to a completely\ncontractive A \u2212 B-bimodule map \u03c6 : Y \u2212\u2192 Z. By the assumption (ii), \u03c6 has to be a\ncomplete isometry, so that Y = Z.\n(iii) =\u21d2 (iv): The same as the proof of Lemma 3.6 in [8]. When applying this proof, note\nthat, if \u03c6 is an \u03b9(X)-projection on Y (i.e. a completely contractive A \u2212 B-bimodule map on\nY with \u03c62 = \u03c6 and \u03c6|\u03b9(X) = id\u03b9(X) ), then Im\u03c6 \u2282 Y is a tight A \u2212 B-injective operator A \u2212 Bbimodule, so that Im\u03c6=Y by minimality of Y . Hence \u03c6(= idY ) is a minimal \u03b9(X)-projection\non Y and Y is its range.\n(iv) =\u21d2 (ii): The same as the proof (Necessity) of Theorem 3.7. in [8].\n(i) =\u21d2 (ii): Let (I(Y ), \u03ba) be an A \u2212 B-injective envelope of Y . By (iii) =\u21d2 (ii), (I(Y ), \u03ba)\nis a tight A \u2212 B-essential extension of Y , so that (I(Y ), \u03ba \u25e6 \u03b9) is a tight A \u2212 B-essential\nextension of X, hence I(Y ) = \u03ba(Y ) by maximality. Thus Y is tight A \u2212 B-injective.\n(ii) =\u21d2 (i): Let (Z, \u03ba) be a tight A \u2212 B-essential extension of Y . By injectivity of Y ,\n\u03ba\u22121 : \u03ba(Y ) \u2212\u2192 Y extends to a completely contractive A \u2212 B-bimodule map \u03c6 : Z \u2212\u2192 Y .\nBut by essentiality of Z, \u03c6 has to be a complete isometry. Thus \u03ba(Y ) = Z.\nFinally, we show completeness. Let Y satisfy the equivalent conditions (i)-(iv) and let\n(Ye , \u03ba) be its completion. Then Ye is an A\u2212B-bimodule and obviously a tight A\u2212B-essential\nextension of Y . By injectivity of Y , \u03ba(Y ) \u2212\u2192 Y extends to a completely contractive A \u2212 Bbimodule map \u03c6 : Ye \u2212\u2192 Y with \u03c6|\u03ba(Y ) completely isometric. But by an essentiality of Ye , \u03c6\nhas to be a complete isometry, so that Ye = \u03ba(Y ).\n\nRemark 3.2. (1) From this theorem, in particular, for any operator A \u2212 B-bimodule X, a\nmaximal tight A\u2212B-essential extension exists, since A\u2212B-injective envelope exists (Remark\n2.2 (2)).\n(2) It immediately follows from rigidity in the above theorem that the A \u2212 B-injective\nenvelope is unique up to completely isometric A \u2212 B-bimodule isomorphisms.\n(3) In particular, if X = A with A a unital C*-algebra, I(A) is completely isometrically\nisomorphic to M. Hamana's injective envelope C*-algebra IC \u2217 (A) ([7]) of A. This is easily\nseen by observing unital completely positive maps are just the same as unital completely\ncontractive maps, and using rigidities of I(A) and IC \u2217 (A). If A is a non-unital C*-algebra,\nstill I(A) is completely isometrically isomorphic to IC \u2217 (A1 ), via a map that restricts to be the\nidentity on A, by Proposition 2.8 in [3], where A1 is the minimal unitization of A. Namely,\nI(A1 ) is completely isometrically isomorphic to I(A). Actually the above identification of\nI(A) with IC \u2217 (A) or IC \u2217 (A1 ) is also as A \u2212 A-, A \u2212 C- and C \u2212 A-bimodules by Remark 2.2\n(3).\nIn the non-tight case a similar result holds thanks to Corollary 2.2 in [5] which is the\ngeneralization of 'rigidity' to the non-tight case in the presence of a module action.\n\n\f6\n\nMASAYOSHI KANEDA* AND VERN IVAL PAULSEN*\n\nTheorem 3.3. Let A be a C*-algebra, I(A) its injective envelope and let E be an operator\nleft A-module with A \u2282 E. Then the following are equivalent:\nE is a maximal A \u2212 C-essential extension of A,\nE is an A \u2212 C-injective and A \u2212 C-essential extension of A,\nE is a minimal A \u2212 C-injective extension of A,\nE is completely boundedly isomorphic to I(A) as left A-modules,\nvia a map that restricts to the identity on A,\n(v) E is an A \u2212 C-injective and A \u2212 C-rigid extension of A.\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\nThe analogous result holds for the operator right A-module case and the operator A-bimodule\ncase.\nProof. Throughout the proof, without loss of generality, we may assume that I(A) =\nIC \u2217 (A) (Remark 3.2 (3)).\nThat (iii) =\u21d2 (iv) was proven in Theorem 3.3 in [5].\nThat (iv) =\u21d2 (iii) follows by noting that any A \u2212 C-injective extension of A which is\ncompletely boundedly isomorphic to a minimal A \u2212 C-injective extension as left A-modules\nis also minimal and that I(A) is a minimal A \u2212 C-injective extension by Theorem 3.1 in [5].\n(iv) =\u21d2 (i): Without loss of generality we may assume that E = I(A). Let W be any\noperator left A-module and \u03c6 : I(A) \u2212\u2192 W a completely bounded left A-module map\nwhich is a completely bounded isomorphism on A. Let \u03c8 : \u03c6(A) \u2212\u2192 A be the inverse\nof this map and extend \u03c8 to a completely bounded left A-module map \u03c8e : W \u2212\u2192 I(A).\nSince \u03c8e \u25e6 \u03c6 : I(A) \u2212\u2192 I(A) is the identity on A, it is the identity on I(A) by rigidity\n(Corollary 2.2 in [5]). This shows that \u03c6(I(A)) is completely boundedly isomorphic to I(A).\nMaximality: Suppose that (F, \u03b9) is an A \u2212 C-essential extension of I(A). A completely\nboundedly isomorphic left A-module map \u03b9\u22121 : \u03b9(I(A)) \u2212\u2192 I(A) extends to a completely\nbounded left A-module map \u03c1 : F \u2212\u2192 I(A). By essentiality of F , \u03c1 has to be a completely\nbounded isomorphism, so that F = \u03b9(I(A)).\n(i) =\u21d2 (iv): We may assume that A \u2282 E \u2282 B(H) for some Hilbert space H by the\nrepresentation theorem for operator modules ([4], [2], [3]). Extend the identity map on A\nto a completely bounded left A-module map \u03c8 : B(H) \u2212\u2192 I(A), then \u03c8(E) \u2282 I(A) is\ncompletely boundedly isomorphic to E. The map \u03c8 \u22121 : \u03c8(E) \u2212\u2192 E extends to a completely\nbounded left A-module map \u03c6 : I(A) \u2212\u2192 B(H). By rigidity (Corollary 2.2 in [5]), \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6 is\nthe identity on I(A). Hence we have A \u2282 E \u2282 \u03c6(I(A)) with \u03c6(I(A)) completely boundedly\nisomorphic to I(A). This makes \u03c6(I(A)) an operator A \u2212 C-essential extension of A by\napplying (iv) =\u21d2 (i) that we have already proved. Thus, by maximality of E, E = \u03c6(I(A))\nso that I(A) is completely boundedly isomorphic to E as left A-modules by \u03c6.\nNow we have that (i) =\u21d2 (ii), since clearly (i) and (iv) imply (ii).\nNext, we show that (ii) =\u21d2 (iv). By the assumption (ii), the identity map on A extends to\na completely bounded left A-module map \u03c6 : E \u2212\u2192 I(A) and the map \u03c6(E) \u2212\u2192 E extends\nto a completely bounded left A-module map \u03c8 : I(A) \u2212\u2192 E. Then \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6 is the identity on\nE. But by rigidity (Corollary 2.2 in [5]), \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8 is the identity on I(A).\n(iv) =\u21d2 (v): Without loss of generality, we may assume that E = I(A). Then (v)\nimmediately follows from Corollary 2.2 in [5].\n\n\fCHARACTERIZATIONS OF ESSENTIAL IDEALS AS OPERATOR MODULES OVER C*-ALGEBRAS 7\n\n(v) =\u21d2 (iv): By injectivity of E, the identity map on A extends to a completely bounded\nleft A-module map \u03c6 : I(A) \u2212\u2192 E. Similarly, by injectivity of I(A), the identity map on A\nextends to a completely contractive A \u2212 B-bimodule map \u03c8 : E \u2212\u2192 I(A). But \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6 = idI(A)\nand \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8 = idE by rigidity of I(A) (Corollary 2.2 in [5]) and E, respectively.\nAs is seen in the above proof, Corollary 2.2 in [5] played a crucial role.\nBefore moving on to the main results, let us introduce some definitions.\n4. Essential left ideals.\nRecall that a closed two-sided ideal K in a C*-algebra A is essential, if aK = {0} implies\na = 0, or, equivalently, Ka = {0} implies a = 0, or, equivalently, K \u2229 K \u2032 6= {0} for all\nnon-zero closed two-sided ideal K \u2032 in A, where a \u2208 A. We now generalize these ideas to the\none-sided case. Note that a subset J \u2282 A is a closed left ideal in A if and only if J \u2217 is a\nclosed right ideal in A. Let J be a closed left ideal in A. As is well known (say, [10], [12],\n[16]), J has a contractive right approximate identity {e\u03b1 }. Namely, {e\u03b1 } \u2282 (J \u2229 J \u2217 )+ is an\nincreasing net and lim\u03b1\u2192\u221e je\u03b1 = j \u2200j \u2208 J and ke\u03b1 k \u2264 1 \u2200\u03b1. Clearly, it is also a contractive\nleft approximate identity of J \u2217 .\nLemma 4.1. Let A be a C*-algebra, I a closed right ideal in A, and J a closed left ideal in\nA. Then\nI \u2229 J = IJ,\nwhere IJ := span{ij; i \u2208 I, j \u2208 J}, here the closure is taken in A.\nProof. I \u2229 J \u2283 IJ is clear. We show I \u2229 J \u2282 IJ. Let i \u2208 I \u2229 J and {e\u03b1 } a right\napproximate identity of J, then i = lim\u03b1\u2192\u221e ie\u03b1 \u2208 IJ.\nProposition 4.2. Let A be a C*-algebra and J a closed left ideal in A. Then the following\nare equivalent.\n(i) JJ* is an essential two-sided ideal in A,\n(ii) If a \u2208 A and aJ = {0}, then a=0,\n(iii) I \u2229 J 6= {0} for any non-zero closed right ideal I in A,\n(iv) K \u2229 J 6= {0} for any non-zero closed two-sided ideal K in A.\nProof. (i) =\u21d2 (ii): Suppose aJ = {0} for a \u2208 A, then aJJ \u2217 = {0}, so that a = 0.\n(ii) =\u21d2 (iii): Let I be a closed right ideal in A with I \u2229 J = {0}, then IJ = {0} by\nLemma 4.1, so that I = {0} by the assumption (ii).\n(iii) =\u21d2 (iv): Clear.\n(iv) =\u21d2 (i): Obviously JJ \u2217 is a closed two-sided ideal in A, so we only show essentiality.\nLet K := {a \u2208 A; aJJ \u2217 = {0}}, then K is a closed two-sided ideal in A. Suppose that\na \u2208 K and aJJ \u2217 = {0}, then 0 = ajj \u2217 a\u2217 = aj(aj)\u2217 for all j \u2208 J, so that aJ = {0}, hence\nK \u2229 J = KJ = {0}. The assumption (iv) yields K = {0}.\nRemark 4.3. Let A and J be the same as the assumptions of Proposition 4.2, and let {e\u03b1 }\nbe a right approximate identity of J.\n(1) JJ \u2217 is the two-sided ideal in A generated by J in A. Also JJ \u2217 = JA since, for any\na \u2208 A, ja = lim\u03b1\u2192\u221e (je\u03b1 )a = j * lim\u03b1\u2192\u221e e\u03b1 a.\n\n\f8\n\nMASAYOSHI KANEDA* AND VERN IVAL PAULSEN*\n\n(2) Any j \u2208 J is written as j = lim\u03b1\u2192\u221e je\u03b1 , hence J \u2282 JJ \u2217 even if A is non-unital.\nSimilarly, J \u2217 \u2282 JJ \u2217 .\n\nDefinition 4.4. Let A and J be the same as the assumptions in Proposition 4.2. When\nthe equivalent statements in Proposition 4.2 hold, we say J is an essential left ideal in A.\nEssential right ideals are defined similarly.\n\n5. Main results.\nIn this section we present our main results, showing the relationships between the various\nnotions of \"essential\" for left ideals. We apologize to the reader in advance for the rather\nlong list of conditions that are equivalent to a left ideal being essential in the C*-algebraic\nsense. However, it is convenient to know that all of these are equivalent. We have presented\nthe results in this particular fashion so that one can more easily contrast the non-tight and\ntwo-sided cases.\n\nTheorem 5.1. Let A be a C*-algebra, J a closed left ideal in A, and {e\u03b1 } a contractive\nright approximate identity of J. Then statements in (I) and (II) are equivalent respectively,\nand \"each statement in (I)\" =\u21d2 (4) =\u21d2 (5) =\u21d2 \"each statement in (II)\".\n\n\fCHARACTERIZATIONS OF ESSENTIAL IDEALS AS OPERATOR MODULES OVER C*-ALGEBRAS 9\n\n\uf8f1\n(1) I(J) is completely isometrically isomorphic to I(A),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nvia a map that restricts to the identity on J,\n(I)\n\uf8f4\n(2) A is a tight C \u2212 C-essential extension of J,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(3) A is a tight A \u2212 C-essential extension of J,\n(4) k(alm )k = sup\u03b1 k(alm e\u03b1 )k for all (alm ) \u2208 Mn (A) and for all n \u2208 N,\n(5) There exists n \u2208 N such that\nk(alm )k = sup\u03b1 k(alm e\u03b1 )k for all (alm ) \u2208 Mn (A),\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n(6) k(alm )k = sup{k(alm )(jlm )k; (jlm ) \u2208 Mn (J), k(jlm )k \u2264 1}\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nfor all (alm ) \u2208 Mn (A) and for all n \u2208 N,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(7) There exists n \u2208 N such that\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nk(alm )k = sup{k(alm )(jlm )k; (jlm ) \u2208 Mn (J), k(jlm )k \u2264 1}\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nfor all (alm ) \u2208 Mn (A),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(8) There exists c \u2265 1 such that\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nk(alm )k \u2264 c * sup{k(alm )(jlm )k; (jlm ) \u2208 Mn (J), k(jlm )k \u2264 1}\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nfor all (alm ) \u2208 Mn (A) and for all n \u2208 N,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(9) There exist c \u2265 1 and n \u2208 N such that\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nk(alm )k \u2264 c * sup{k(alm )(jlm )k; (jlm ) \u2208 Mn (J), k(jlm )k \u2264 1}\n\uf8f2\n(II)\nfor all (alm ) \u2208 Mn (A),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(10) A is a tight C \u2212 J-essential extension of J,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(11) A is a C \u2212 J-essential extension of J,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(12) A is a tight A \u2212 J-essential extension of J,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(13) A is an A \u2212 J-essential extension of J,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(14) Mn (J) is an essential left ideal in Mn (A) for all n \u2208 N,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(15) Mn (J) is an essential left ideal in Mn (A) for some n \u2208 N,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(16) Mn (A) is canonically *-isomorphically embedded in M(Mn (JJ \u2217 ))\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nfor all n \u2208 N,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(17) Mn (A) is canonically *-isomorphically embedded in M(Mn (JJ \u2217 ))\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nfor some n \u2208 N,\nwhere M(Mn (JJ \u2217 )) is the multiplier algebra of Mn (JJ \u2217 ).\nProof.

Let (alm ) \u2208 Mn (A) be the matrix such that\na11 = a and all other entries are 0. Then, by the assumption, (alm ) * Mn (J) = {0} which\nimplies (alm ) = (0) from (15), so that a = 0.

Namely, K(Mn (J)) :=\nspan{\u03b8j,j \u2032 ; j, j \u2032 \u2208 Mn (J)}, where \u03b8j,j \u2032 : Mn (J) \u2212\u2192 Mn (J) is defined by \u03b8j,j \u2032 (j \u2032\u2032 ) := jj \u2032 \u2217 j \u2032\u2032 for\n\u2200j, \u2200j \u2032 , \u2200j \u2032\u2032 \u2208 Mn (J), and the closure is taken in B(Mn (J)).\nThe map \u03c6 is the canonical embedding.\nP\n\u2032 \u2217\nThe\nmap \u03c1 : Mn (JJ \u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 K(Mn (J)) is defined in the following way: \u03c1( m (jm jm\n)) =\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032 , \u2200jm , \u2200j\nm \u2208 Mn (J) is a well-defined *-homomorphism and extends to an onto\nm \u03b8jm ,jm\n*-homomorphism Mn (JJ \u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 K(Mn (J)). By Proposition 4.2, Mn (J) is an essential left\nideal in Mn (JJ \u2217 ), thus \u03c1 is one-to-one and hence a *-isomorphism. Therefore, we obtain a\n*-isomorphism \u03c1\u0303 : M(Mn (JJ \u2217 )) \u2212\u2192 M(K(Mn (J))).\nThe map \u03c4 \u22121 : B(Mn (J)) \u2212\u2192 M(K(Mn (J))) is defined in the following way: \u03c4 \u22121 (T ) :=\n(T1 , T2 ), where T1 (\u03b8j,j \u2032 ) := T * \u03b8j,j \u2032 , T2 (\u03b8j,j \u2032 ) := \u03b8j,j \u2032 * T, \u2200T \u2208 B(Mn (J)). For a proof that \u03c4 \u22121\nis a *-isomorphism, see [11], [18].\nWe can easily see that \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03c1\u0303 \u25e6 \u03c6(a) = Ta , where Ta (j) := aj, \u2200a \u2208 Mn (A), \u2200j \u2208 Mn (J).\nHence (6) follows.\n(17) =\u21d2 (7): The same as that (16) =\u21d2 (6).\nRemark 5.2. (1) sup\u03b1 k(alm e\u03b1 )k does not depend on a choice of contractive right approximate identities. In fact, take another contractive right approximate identity f\u03b2 . Then, by\nnoting that {e\u03b1 } \u2282 J \u2229J \u2217 and f\u03b2 is also a contractive left approximate identity of J \u2217 (Remark\n4.3), lim\u03b2\u2192\u221e e\u03b1 f\u03b2 = e\u03b1 = lim\u03b2\u2192\u221e f\u03b2 e\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1.

The similar thing holds in Theorem 5.3, Corollary 5.4\nand Corollary 5.5.\n\n\f12\n\nMASAYOSHI KANEDA* AND VERN IVAL PAULSEN*\n\n(2) It is interesting to note that injective envelopes are related to tight \"C \u2212 C\"-, or,\n\"A \u2212 C\"-essential extensions, while essential left ideals are related to tight \"C \u2212 J\"-, or,\n\"A \u2212 J\"-essential extensions.\n(3) In (4) and (5) of Theorem 5.1, we can replace k(alm e\u03b1 )k by k(e\u03b1 alm )k. In fact, k(alm )k =\nk(alm )\u2217 k = sup\u03b1 k(a\u2217ml e\u03b1 )k = sup\u03b1 k(e\u03b1 alm )k. Similar considerations hold in Theorem 5.3,\nCorollary 5.4, and Corollary 5.5.\n(4) (5) of Theorem 5.1 is equivalent to saying that kak = sup\u03b1 kae\u03b1 k for all a \u2208 A. Similar\nconsiderations hold in Theorem 5.3, Corollary 5.4, and Corollary 5.5.\n(5) The statement (9) with n = 1 is equivalent to saying that the left A-module J is cfaithful in the terminology of [2]. Hence we saw that if we regard left ideals of A as operator\nleft A-modules, then J being faithful4 and J being c-faithful are equivalent for any c \u2265 1.\n(6) In the proof that (16) =\u21d2 (6) and that (17) =\u21d2 (7), we used the Hilbert C*-module\ntheory. We can give an alternative proof of these parts that looks easier but is less informative\n(The involution is not given explicitly.). First, note that, that (16) =\u21d2 (14) and that\n(17) =\u21d2 (15) easily follow. So it suffices to show that (14) =\u21d2 (6). We use an already\nknown principle ([17], [1]) : Any contractive homomorphism from C*-algebra to Banach\nalgebra is a *-homomorphism with a certain involution in the range. In fact, B(Mn (J))\nis a Banach algebra and the canonical embedding Mn (A) \u2212\u2192 B(Mn (J)) is a contractive\nhomomorphism. (14) implies that this embedding is one-to-one, hence a *-isomorphism, so\nthat (6) follows.\nFor the non-tight case, we could not connect essential extensions with injective envelopes.\nThis is mainly because we can not say I(J) is a (non-tight) A \u2212 C-rigid extension of J. But\nstill a similar result holds.\nTheorem 5.3. Let A, J and {e\u03b1 } be the same as the assumptions in Theorem 5.1. Then\n(2a) =\u21d2 (3a) =\u21d2 (4a) =\u21d2 (5a) =\u21d2 \"each statement of (II) in Theorem 5.1\".\n(2a) A is a C \u2212 C-essential extension of J,\n(3a) A is an A \u2212 C-essential extension of J,\n(4a) There exists c \u2265 1 such that\nk(alm )k \u2264 c * sup\u03b1 k(alm e\u03b1 )k for all (alm ) \u2208 Mn (A) and all n \u2208 N,\n(5a) There exist c \u2265 1 and n \u2208 N\nsuch that k(alm )k \u2264 c * sup\u03b1 k(alm e\u03b1 )k for all (alm ) \u2208 Mn (A).\nProof. (2a) =\u21d2 (3a): Clear.\n(3a) =\u21d2 (4a): Similar to that (3) =\u21d2 (4) in Theorem 5.1.\nThat (4a) =\u21d2 (5a) =\u21d2 \"(9) in Theorem 5.1\" is clear.\nNote that the statement (2a) says just that A = J. In fact, if J $ A, then we can take a\nJ-projection \u03c6 on A (i.e. a completely bounded linear map on A with \u03c62 = \u03c6 and \u03c6|J = idJ )\nsuch that J \u2282Im\u03c6 $ A with the codimension of Im\u03c6 in A is 1.\nTogether with the right ideal versions of Theorem 5.1 and Theorem 5.3, and by noting\nthat, when J is a two-sided ideal in A, C \u2212 J- or A \u2212 J- in (10)-(13) of Theorem 5.1 can\n4\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that J is an essential left ideal in A in our definition (Definition 4.4).\n\n\fCHARACTERIZATIONS OF ESSENTIAL IDEALS AS OPERATOR MODULES OVER C*-ALGEBRAS 13\n\nbe replaced by C \u2212 A- or A \u2212 A- with trivial modifications in the proof, the next corollary\nimmediately follows.\nCorollary 5.4.

Examples and applications.\n\nIt is easy to construct an example of a left but not two-sided ideal which satisfies all the\nstatements in Theorem 5.1.\nExample 6.1. Let A be any C*-algebra which properly contains an essential two-sided\nideal K. Set\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA K\nJ :=\n.\nA K\nThen J is a left but not two-sided ideal in M2 (A) and M2 (K) \u2282 J \u2282 M2 (A), hence we can\nmake I(M2 (K)) \u2282 I(J) \u2282 I(M2 (A)) with an injective envelope (I(Mn (K)), \u03b9) of Mn (K). The\nidentity map on I(M2 (K)) extends to a completely contractive linear map \u03c6 : I(M2 (A)) \u2212\u2192\nI(M2 (K)). M2 (A) is a tight A \u2212 C-essential extension of M2 (K) by Corollary 5.4, and\nI(M2 (A)) is a tight A \u2212 C-essential extension of M2 (A) by Theorem 3.1, so that I(M2 (A)) is\na tight A\u2212C-essential extension of M2 (K). Hence by rigidity (Theorem 3.1), \u03c6 is a complete\nisometry since it fixes each element of \u03b9(M2 (K)). Thus I(M2 (A)) = I(J) = I(M2 (K)).\nThe following example shows that each statement in (II) in Theorem 5.1 does not necessarily imply (5) in Theorem 5.1 or (5a) in Theorem 5.3. Especially, J is an essential left\nideal in A is equivalent to saying that A is a (tight) C \u2212 J-essential extension of J, but those\ndo not necessarily imply that A is a (tight) A \u2212 C-essential extension of J.\n\n\fCHARACTERIZATIONS OF ESSENTIAL IDEALS AS OPERATOR MODULES OVER C*-ALGEBRAS 15\n\nExample 6.2. Let A := M2 and\nJ :=\n\n\u0012\n\nC O\nC O\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nThen\u0012A is a \u0013\nC*-algebra and J is a closed left ideal in A with a contractive right identity.\n1 0\n. It is easy to see JJ \u2217 = A, so especially, JJ \u2217 is an essential two-sided ideal\ne :=\n0 0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 0\nin A, hence J is an essential left ideal in A by Definition 4.4. Let a :=\n, and let\n0 1\n(alm ) \u2208 Mn (A) be such that a11 = a, alm = 0 if l 6= 1 or m 6= 1. Then k(alm )k = 1, while\nk(alm e)k = 0.\nRemark 6.3. In general, if A is a C*-algebra and J is a closed left ideal in A, and if A\nis a (resp., tight) A \u2212 C-essential extension of J, and J is properly contained in A, then\nJ does not have a (resp., contractive) right identity. In fact, suppose that J has a (resp.,\ncontractive) right identity e. Then (alm ) 7\u2212\u2192 (alm e) \u2200(alm ) \u2208 Mn (A), \u2200n \u2208 N defines a\ncompletely bounded (resp., completely contractive) left A-module map \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 J which is\ncompletely isometric on J, so that \u03c6 is a completely bounded isomorphism (resp., a complete\nisometry). But 0 6= (a \u2212 ae) \u2208Ker\u03c6 for a \u2208 A \\ J, hence a contradiction. Especially, for any\nfinite dimensional left ideal J $ A, A can not be a (tight) A \u2212 C-essential extension of J.\nWe close this section with another application of a part of Theorem 5.1. As is defined in\n[13], for two C*-algebras A and B with A, B \u2282 B(H) for some Hilbert space H, we say that\nA norms B when the following equation holds for each n \u2265 1 and for each X \u2208 Mn (B).\nkXk = sup{kRXCk; R \u2208 Rown (A), C \u2208 Coln (A), kRk, kCk \u2264 1}\nWhere Rown (A) and Coln (A) are, respectively, row and column matrices over A. We show\nthat, if A is an essential two-sided ideal in B, then A norms B. By Lemma 2.4 in [13], it\nsuffices to show that, for each n \u2265 1 and for each X \u2208 Mn (B),\nkXk = sup{kXCk; C \u2208 Coln (A), kCk \u2264 1}.\nBut Coln (A) is an essential left ideal in Mn (B), so the equation follows from Theorem 5.1\n(14) =\u21d2 (6).\n7. Conclusions and questions.\n(1) Compared with the tight case, the non-tight case is generally unknown. The difficulty\nin the non-tight case mainly comes from the lack of a rigidity result that does not need some\nmodule actions. Even in the Banach space case, there are a few deep results, but the entire\npicture is unclear. We do not know the existence of a \"non-tight injective envelope\", namely\na minimal injective extension, for an arbitrary operator space. Also the lack of rigidity makes\nit difficult to connect essential extensions with even tight injective envelopes. As a result,\nwe do not know if either of the following implications is true: A is a tight A \u2212 C-essential\n?\nextension of J \u21d0\u21d2 A is an A \u2212 C-essential extension of J.\n?\n?\n?\n?\n(2) The implications (5) =\u21d2 (4) =\u21d2 (3) in Theorem 5.1 and (5a) =\u21d2 (4a) =\u21d2 (3a) in\nTheorem 5.3 are still unknown.\n\n\f16\n\nMASAYOSHI KANEDA* AND VERN IVAL PAULSEN*\n\n(3) As one possible generalization of the results in this paper, one can consider replacing\nC*-algebras by operator algebras. In such a case, the difficulty comes from the fact that we\nstill do not know whether or not the representation B(H) of an operator A\u2212B-bimodule ([4],\n[2], [3]) is A\u2212B-injective. Consequently, we do not know the existence of any A\u2212B-injective\noperator modules. Such modules play an important role in characterizing and constructing\nessential extensions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
