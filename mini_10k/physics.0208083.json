Introduction\nRecently, we have presented a wave equation which incorporates a natural frequency\n\u03c90 and the electric scalar potential and is proposed to govern the matter wave associated\nwith a charged particle [1]. For a harmonic-like wavefunction, the wave equation leads to\na first-order time evolution equation similar to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. Then it has been\nfound that the energies of quantum states in an atom decrease with the atom speed by the\nfamous Lorentz speed-dependent mass-variation factor. The propagation of matter wave as\nwell as electromagnetic wave is supposed to follow the local-ether model [2]. Accordingly,\nthe position vectors, time derivatives, and velocities in this wave equation are all referred\nspecifically to an ECI (earth-centered inertial) frame for earthbound phenomena. Thus\nthe atom speed incorporates the linear velocity due to earth's rotation. Consequently,\nthe quantum state energy and the transition frequency of an earthbound atom depend on\nearth's rotation, but are entirely independent of earth's orbital motion around the Sun\nor others. This effect of earth's rotation on atomic quantum properties has been used to\naccount for the east-west directional anisotropy in the atomic clock rate which in turn has\nbeen demonstrated in the Hafele-Keating experiment with circumnavigation clocks. It also\naccounts for the synchronism and the clock-rate adjustment in GPS (global positioning\nsystem) and the spatial isotropy in the Hughes-Drever experiment [1].\nFurthermore, from the local-ether evolution equation, the velocity and then the acceleration of a charged particle under the influence of the electric scalar potential have been\nderived. Thus the electrostatic force is derived in conjunction with the consequence that\nthe natural frequency \u03c90 is related to the rest mass m0 of the particle in the familiar form\nof m0 = h\u0304\u03c90 /c2 [1]. Further, the local-ether wave equation is extended in such a way that\nthe electric scalar potential is made to connect to the augmentation operator which in turn\nis associated with the momentum operator and the velocity of source practices. Then the\nelectromagnetic force law is derived. Under the low-speed condition, this law reduces to the\nmodified Lorentz force law [3].\n\n1\n\n\fIn this investigation, we derive the effect of the augmentation operator in the interaction\nof atoms with electromagnetic radiation. Then the relation between the local-ether evolution\nequation and Schr\u00f6dinger's equation incorporating the vector potential is explored.\n\n2. Schr\u00f6dinger's Equation with Vector Potential\nTo begin with, we review the famous Schr\u00f6dinger's equation and its consequences. It\nis well known that in the presence of the scalar potential \u03a6 and the vector potential A,\nSchr\u00f6dinger's equation reads\nih\u0304\n\n1\n\u2202\n[p \u2212 qA(r, t)]2 \u03c8(r, t) + q\u03a6(r, t)\u03c8(r, t),\n\u03c8(r, t) =\n\u2202t\n2m0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the operator p = \u2212ih\u0304\u2207. The incorporation of the vector potential corresponds to the\nunderstanding in classical mechanics that the mechanical momentum in the Hamiltonian is\ngiven by the canonical momentum p minus qA.\nIt is known that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an individual spectral line\nof atoms will split into a set of closely spaced lines, known as the Zeeman splitting. The\nZeeman effect has been accounted for by using quantum mechanics. For this familiar case\nof interaction of a hydrogen-like atom with the electromagnetic radiation from an external\nsource, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation becomes [4, 5]\nih\u0304\n\nq\n1\n1 2\n\u2202\np \u03c8 + q\u03a6a \u03c8 \u2212\nA * p\u03c8 +\n(qA)2 \u03c8,\n\u03c8=\n\u2202t\n2m0\nm0\n2m0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a6a is the electric scalar (Coulomb) potential due to the nucleus of the atom itself\nand A is the vector potential due to the external source. As in the literature, we have made\nuse of p * (A\u03c8) = A * p\u03c8 since p * A is taken to be zero. Physically, the Coulomb gauge\n\u2207 * A = 0 implies that the source generating the vector potential is electrically neutralized,\nas it is ordinarily. If the term p * A does not vanish, one has p * A/m0 = (ih\u0304/m0 c2 )\u2202\u03a6/\u2202t\nfrom the Lorenz gauge, where potential \u03a6 is due to the charge associated with the nonneutralized current generating potential A. The angular frequency of an ordinary timeharmonic potential is much lower than m0 c2 /h\u0304. Therefore, the term p*A/m0 is much weaker\nthan the corresponding potential \u03a6 and hence is not expected to have an appreciable physical\nconsequence even if it does exist. In our understanding, the reference frame of the position\nvector in wavefunction and potentials and that of the time derivative are not specified in\nSchr\u00f6dinger's equation.\nMoreover, from the generalized Ehrenfest's theorem, the electromagnetic force exerted\non an unbounded charged particle due to the scalar and vector potentials can be given in\nterms of the expectation values as [4]\n\u001d\n\u001c\nd2 hri\n1\n\u2202A\nF = m0\n+\n=\n\u2212q\nh\u2207\u03a6i\n\u2212\nq\nq {h(p \u2212 qA) \u00d7 Bi \u2212 hB \u00d7 (p \u2212 qA)i} , (3)\ndt2\n\u2202t\n2m0\nwhere the magnetic flux density B = \u2207 \u00d7 A. As noted in [4], in this formula the operator\np in (p \u2212 qA) does not commute with field B. Thus the preceding force formula does not\nagree exactly with the Lorentz force law. The discrepancy between these two force formulas\nis expected to be (ih\u0304q/2m0 )\u2207 \u00d7 B. Although this discrepancy may be small in magnitude,\nit has not yet solved to our knowledge.\n\n3. Local-Ether Wave Equation and its Consequences\nWe then go on to consider the local-ether wave equation. It is postulated that under\nthe influence of the electric scalar potential \u03a6, the matter wave \u03a8 of a charged particle is\ngoverned by the nonhomogeneous wave equation proposed to be [1]\n\u001b\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001a\n\u03c92\n2\n1 \u22022\nq\u03a6(r, t) \u03a8(r, t),\n(4)\n\u22072 \u2212 2 2 \u03a8(r, t) = 20 1 +\nc \u2202t\nc\nh\u0304\u03c90\n2\n\n\fwhere the natural frequency \u03c90 as well as the charge q is an inherent constant of the particle,\nand the position vector r and the time derivative are referred to the associated local-ether\nframe, which is an ECI frame for earthbound particles.\nIf the potential \u03a6 is weak, the wavefunction \u03a8 tends to be close to a space-time harmonic\neik*r e\u2212i\u03c9t , where \u03c9 2 = \u03c902 + c2 k 2 . Thus it has been shown that the velocity of the\np particle is\ngiven by v = kc2 /\u03c9 and hence the angular frequency can be given by \u03c9 = \u03c90 / 1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 ,\nwhere the velocity v is referred specifically to the local-ether frame. As the natural frequency\n\u03c90 is shown to be related to the rest mass m0 , the speed-dependent\nmass m related to the\np\nfrequency \u03c9 is then given by the familiar form of m = m0 / 1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 [1]. It is noted\nthat these relations of the speed-dependent angular frequency and wavelength of matter\nwave and of the speed-dependent mass of particle look like the postulates of de Broglie\nand the Lorentz mass-variation law, except that the particle speed v is referred specifically\nto the local-ether frame. Thereafter, by introducing the reduced wavefunction \u03c8 given by\n\u03a8(r, t) = \u03c8(r, t)eik*r e\u2212i\u03c9t and by expanding the Laplacian and the time derivative in the\nd'Alembertian operator, it has been shown that the preceding wave equation in \u03a8 reduces\nto the first-order time evolution equation in \u03c8 [1]. That is,\nih\u0304\n\n\u03c9 \u2202\nh\u03042\nh\u03042 2\n\u2207 \u03c8(r, t) + q\u03a6(r, t)\u03c8(r, t) \u2212 i\nk * \u2207\u03c8(r, t).\n\u03c8(r, t) = \u2212\n\u03c90 \u2202t\n2m0\nm0\n\n(5)\n\nAgain, the position vector r here is referred to the local-ether frame.\nConsider a hydrogen-like atom which is moving at a velocity va with respect to the\nlocal-ether frame. It is expected that the electric scalar potential \u03a6a due to the nucleus\nof the atom will move with this atom. Accordingly, this potential is stationary in the\natom frame with respect to which the atom is stationary, while it is moving in the localether frame. Under Galilean transformations, the potential comoving with the atom can\nbe written as \u03a6a (r) or as \u03a6a (r \u2212 va t), where the position vector r is referred to the atom\nor to the local-ether frame, respectively. The average value of the velocity of the electron\nbounded in the atom should be identical to the atom velocity va ; otherwise, the electron\ntends to escape from the atom. Thus the spatial and temporal variation of the wavefunction\nof the bounded electron can be expected to be close to the factored-out harmonic eik*r e\u2212i\u03c9t\nand then the reduced wavefunction is governed by the preceding evolution p\nequation, where\nthe propagation vector k = mva /h\u0304, the speed-dependent mass m = m0 / 1 \u2212 va2 /c2 , the\npotential is given by \u03a6a (r \u2212 va t), and the position vector r is referred to the local-ether\nframe.\nRemark the Galilean transformation\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n=\n+ va * \u2207f,\n(6)\n\u2202t a\n\u2202t\nwhere \u2202/\u2202t and (\u2202/\u2202t)a denote the time derivatives with respect to the local-ether and the\natom frames and are taken under constant r and (r \u2212 va t), respectively, as r is referred\nto the local-ether frame. Thereby, for the electron bounded in the moving atom, the time\nevolution equation observed in the atom frame becomes [1]\nih\u0304\n\n\u03c9 \u2202\nh\u03042 2\n\u2207 \u03c8(r, t) + q\u03a6a (r)\u03c8(r, t),\n\u03c8(r, t) = \u2212\n\u03c90 \u2202t\n2m0\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the position vector r and hence the time derivative are referred to the atom frame,\ninstead of the local-ether one. It is noted that the time derivative connects\nwith an extra\np\nmultiplying term of \u03c9/\u03c90 which is just the mass-variation factor 1/ 1 \u2212 va2 /c2 . However,\nexcept for this factor, the time evolution equation as well as the potential is independent of\nthe motion of atom if the atom frame is adopted as the reference frame. Consequently, the\nsolutions for the eigenfunction \u03c8 and the eigenvalue h\u0304\u03c9\u0303(\u03c9/\u03c90 ) of this equation in the atom\nframe will be independent of the atom speed va . Accordingly, as compared to that of a\nstationary atom, the energy h\u0304\u03c9\u0303 of each quantum state will decrease with the inverse of the\n3\n\n\fmass-variation factor when the atom is moving at speed va with respect to the local-ether\nframe.\nThe frequency of light emitted from or absorbed by an atom is known to be equal to the\ntransition frequency which in turn is proportional to the difference in energy between two\ninvolved quantum states. Thus the transition frequency f is determined by the energy h\u0304\u03c9\u0303\nand then decreases with increasing atom speed by the inverse of the mass-variation factor.\nThat is,\np\n(8)\nf = f0 1 \u2212 va2 /c2 ,\n\nwhere the atom speed va is referred specifically to the local-ether frame and f0 is the rest\ntransition frequency of the atom when it is stationary in this frame. Consequently, the transition frequency and hence the clock rate of earthbound atomic clocks depend on earth's\nrotation, but are entirely independent of earth's orbital motion. Thereby, the atomic clock\nflying westward tends to have a lower speed and tick at a faster rate than the one flying\neastward. Thus the preceding formula accounts for the east-west directional anisotropy in\natomic clock rate demonstrated in the Hafele-Keating experiment with circumnavigation\nclocks. On the other hand, for a geostationary atom or an atom onboard an earth's satellite moving in a circular orbit, the speed va and hence the transition frequency f remain\nunchanged with the passage of time. Thus the preceding formula also accounts for the\nhigh synchronism among the various GPS atomic clocks moving in nearly circular orbits\nand for the spatial isotropy in transition frequency in the Hughes-Drever experiment with\ngeostationary atoms [1].\nMoreover, in order to derive the whole electromagnetic force, it is proposed that the\nwave equation is modified by connecting the potential \u03a6 to a dimensionless operator U . For\nthe electric scalar potential \u03a6 due to source particles of a given velocity vs with respect to\nthe local-ether frame, it is postulated that the local-ether wave equation incorporates the\noperator U [3]. That is,\n\u001b\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001a\n\u03c902\n2\n1 \u22022\n2\nq\u03a6(r, t)(1 + U ) \u03a8(r, t),\n(9)\n\u2207 \u2212 2 2 \u03a8(r, t) = 2 1 +\nc \u2202t\nc\nh\u0304\u03c90\n\nwhere operator U is derived from the Laplacian operator and is given by\n1\nU= 2\n2c\n\n\u00132\n\u0012\nc2\n\u2212i \u2207 \u2212 vs .\n\u03c90\n\n(10)\n\nThe operator U tends to enhance the effect of the electric scalar potential and hence is called\nthe augmentation operator. Again, the local-ether wave equation can lead to a first-order\ntime evolution equation in terms of the reduced wavefunction \u03c8. When the particle speed\nis low and then the propagation vector k in the factored-out harmonic is taken to zero, the\nevolution equation reads\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\n1 2\np \u03c8(r, t) + q\u03a6(r, t)(1 + U )\u03c8(r, t),\n\u03c8(r, t) =\n\u2202t\n2m0\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the position vector r is referred to the local-ether frame. By evaluating the velocity\nand then the acceleration of the charged particle under the influence of the electric scalar\npotential connected to the augmentation operator in a quantum-mechanically approach, the\nelectromagnetic force exerted on the particle has been derived [3].\nConsider the force law for the ordinary case where the source particles are drifting in a\nmatrix and the ions which constitute the matrix tend to electrically neutralize the mobile\nparticles, such as electrons in a metal wire. Suppose the neutralizing matrix is of an arbitrary\ncharge density \u03c1m and moves as a whole at a velocity vm with respect to the local-ether\nframe, while the mobile source particles are of charge density \u03c1v and move at vs with respect\nto this frame. Under the ordinary low-speed condition where all the involved particles move\nslowly with respect to the local-ether frame and the sources drift very slowly with respect to\n4\n\n\fthe matrix frame, the electromagnetic force law for a particle of charge q and inertial mass\nm0 can be given in terms of the local-ether potentials \u03a6 and A [3]. That is,\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u2202\nF(r, t) = q \u2212\u2207\u03a6(r, t) \u2212\nA(r, t)\n+ vem \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 A(r, t) ,\n(12)\n\u2202t\nm\nwhere the time derivative (\u2202/\u2202t)m is referred to the matrix frame, the velocity difference\nvem = ve \u2212 vm , and ve is the velocity of the charged particle with respect to the local-ether\nframe. The electric scalar potential \u03a6 and the magnetic vector potential A in turn are given\nby\nZ\n\u03c1n (r\u2032 , t \u2212 R/c) \u2032\n1\ndv\n(13)\n\u03a6(r, t) =\n\u01eb0\n4\u03c0R\nand\nZ\n1\nJn (r\u2032 , t \u2212 R/c) \u2032\nA(r, t) =\ndv ,\n(14)\n2\n\u01eb0 c\n4\u03c0R\nwhere potential \u03a6 is due to the net charge density \u03c1n = \u03c1v + \u03c1m , potential A is due to the\nneutralized current density Jn = vsm \u03c1v , vsm (= vs \u2212 vm ) is the Newtonian relative velocity\nof the source particle with respect to the matrix, and R = |r \u2212 r\u2032 |. It has been pointed out\nthat the formula (12) is identical to the Lorentz force law, if the latter is observed in the\nmatrix frame, as done tacitly in common practice [3].\n\n4. Modifications of Schr\u00f6dinger's Equation\nIn what follows, we derive from the local-ether wave equation the evolution equation for\nthe interaction of atoms with electromagnetic radiation. Consider an atom which is moving\nat a velocity va with respect to the local-ether frame. Again, the spatial variation of the\nwavefunction \u03a8 of the bounded electron is expected to be close to the space harmonic eik*r ,\nwhere the position vector r is referred to the local-ether frame. Thus the Laplacian becomes\nn\no\n\u22072 \u03a8(r, t) = \u22072 \u03c8\u0303(r, t) + i2k * \u2207\u03c8\u0303(r, t) \u2212 k 2 \u03c8\u0303(r, t) eik*r ,\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03a8(r, t) = \u03c8\u0303(r, t)eik*r and \u03c8\u0303 is a weak function of space. The term associated with k 2\nis neglected hereafter, as the atom speed va is supposed to be much lower than c. Thereby,\nthe local-ether wave equation (9) becomes\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03c92\n2\u03c90\n1 \u22022\n2\n(16)\n\u2207 \u2212 2 2 \u03c8\u0303(r, t) = 20 \u03c8\u0303(r, t) + 2 q\u03a6(1 + Uk )\u03c8\u0303(r, t) \u2212 i2k * \u2207\u03c8\u0303(r, t),\nc \u2202t\nc\nh\u0304c\n\nwhere the augmentation operator Uk is defined as\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1\np\nh\u0304k\nUk = 2\n+\n\u2212 vs .\n2c\nm0\nm0\n\n(17)\n\nIt is seen that the incorporation of k is owing to the manipulation that the space harmonic\neik*r is factored out from \u03a8.\nConsider the ordinary case where the scalar potential \u03a6 as well as the spatial rate of\nvariation of \u03a8 is weak. Thus the temporal variation of \u03a8 or \u03c8\u0303 is close to that of the harmonic\ne\u2212i\u03c90 t and then the wavefunction can be given as \u03c8\u0303(r, t) = \u03c8(r, t)e\u2212i\u03c90 t , where \u03c8 is a weak\nfunction of space and time. Then its second time derivative becomes\n\u001a 2\n\u001b\n\u22022\n\u2202\n\u2202\n2\n\u03c8(r, t) \u2212 i2\u03c90 \u03c8(r, t) \u2212 \u03c90 \u03c8(r, t) e\u2212i\u03c90 t .\n\u03c8\u0303(r, t) =\n(18)\n\u2202t2\n\u2202t2\n\u2202t\nAs the temporal variation of \u03c8 is relatively weak, the second derivative \u2202 2 \u03c8/\u2202t2 can be\nneglected. Then we have the first-order time evolution equation in terms of the reduced\nwavefunction \u03c8\n1\nc2 2\nc2\n\u2202\n\u2207 \u03c8(r, t) \u2212 i q\u03a6(1 + Uk )\u03c8(r, t) \u2212\nk * \u2207\u03c8(r, t).\n\u03c8(r, t) = i\n\u2202t\n2\u03c90\nh\u0304\n\u03c90\n5\n\n(19)\n\n\fWe then go on to rearrange the evolution equation to express it in the atom frame, instead\nof the local-ether frame. The last term in the preceding equation can be written as \u2212va *\u2207\u03c8,\nsince the propagation vector can be given by k = m0 va /h\u0304. Thus, by using the Galilean\ntransformation (6) again, the time evolution equation for the electron bounded in a moving\natom becomes\nih\u0304\n\nh\u03042 2\n\u2202\n\u2207 \u03c8(r, t) + q\u03a6(r, t)(1 + Uk )\u03c8(r, t),\n\u03c8(r, t) = \u2212\n\u2202t\n2m0\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the position vector r and hence the time derivative are referred to the atom frame.\nAs the potential in the preceding equation is given simply by \u03a6(r, t) with r being referred\nto the atom frame, it has to be given by \u03a6(r \u2212 va t, t) in (19) with r being referred to the\nlocal-ether frame.\nOrdinarily, the electromagnetic radiation in the interaction of atoms comes from a\nneutralized source. The electric scalar potential is supposed to be composed as \u03a6 =\n\u03a6a + \u03a6s + \u03a6m , where \u03a6a is due to the nucleus of the atom, \u03a6s to the mobile charged\nparticles forming the current in an external source, and \u03a6m to the matrix in this neutralized source. Under complete neutralization, \u03a6s = \u2212\u03a6m . Further, suppose the source is\nstationary in the atom frame, that is, vm = va . Thus the Doppler frequency shift is not\ninvolved. Then it is easy to show that\n(\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132 )\n1\np\n1\np\n\u03a6s\n=\u2212\n\u2212 vsm \u2212\nA * p + A * vsm , (21)\n(\u03a6s + \u03a6m )(1 + Uk ) = 2\n2c\nm0\nm0\nm0\n2\nwhere the vector potential due to the neutralized source is given according to (14) as\nA=\n\n1\nvsm \u03a6s .\nc2\n\n(22)\n\nThus the atom-frame evolution equation becomes\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\nq\n1\n1 2\np \u03c8(r, t) + q\u03a6a (r)\u03c8(r, t) \u2212\nA * p\u03c8 + qA * vsm \u03c8,\n\u03c8(r, t) =\n\u2202t\n2m0\nm0\n2\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the augmentation operator connected to potential \u03a6a is neglected as the effect of\nits influence on the quantum states is small in the interaction. Again, the potential \u03a6a is\nsupposed to move with the atom and is stationary in the atom frame, while it is moving in\nthe local-ether frame. It is noted that the time evolution equation as well as the potential\nis independent of the motion of atom if the atom frame is adopted as the reference frame.\nThe preceding evolution equation then looks like Schr\u00f6dinger's equation (2), except\nthe last term and the reference frame. The last term in the preceding equation is of the\nsecond order of normalized speed vsm /c and is very weak as the drift speed vsm is very\nlow, while the corresponding one in Schr\u00f6dinger's equation is a quadratic term of qA. It\nis seen that the latter is smaller in magnitude than the former by a factor of |q\u03a6s |/m0 c2\nwhich in turn is much less than unity. Anyway, this second-order interaction is commonly\nignored in analysis [4, 5] and no quantitative measurements are reported, to our knowledge.\nHowever, one fundamental difference is that the position vector, the time derivative, and the\ndrift velocity are referred specifically to the atom frame. In the perturbational treatment\nof interaction, the quantum states of the unperturbed system are usually taken from the\nsolutions of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation with a stationary potential \u03a6a . By so doing, one has\nactually adopted the atom frame as the reference frame tacitly, although the result can\nbe frame-independent. Thereby, the preceding evolution equation is identical to\nSchr\u00f6dinger's equation, if the latter is observed in the atom frame as done tacitly\nin common practice. In other words, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation (2) with a stationary potential\n\u03a6a has some hidden restrictions. That is, the reference frame is actually the atom frame, the\natom speed is low in the local-ether frame, the source generating the interacting potential\n6\n\n\fis electrically neutralized and is stationary in the atom frame, and the drift speed in the\nsource is very low in this frame. However, these conditions are so common as to be ignored\neasily.\nThe evolution equation (11), (20), or (23) then presents modifications of Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation, referred specifically either to the local-ether or to the atom frame. It is noted\nthat the atom-frame evolution equation (23) is independent of the atom velocity itself.\nTherefore, its consequences comply with Galilean relativity and hence are independent of\nearth's motions. However, this is owing to the approximation that the k 2 term in (15) is\nomitted. When this second-order term is retained and hence the restriction of low atom\nspeed is removed, the effect of earth's rotation resumes as in the consequences of (7).\n\n5. Conclusion\nBased on the local-ether wave equation incorporating a nature frequency, the electric\nscalar potential, and the augmentation operator, the first-order time evolution equation is\nderived for a harmonic-like wavefunction. Then the effect of the augmentation operator\nin the interaction of atoms with electromagnetic radiation is discussed. Except a small\nsecond-order term, this evolution equation can be identical to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation with\nthe vector potential, if the latter is observed in the atom frame. In common practice, this\nframe has been adopted tacitly as the reference frame, as the scalar potential due to the\natom is taken to be stationary. The predicted second-order interaction is stronger than the\none in Schr\u00f6dinger's equation and might provide a means to test the modified equation.\nBesides, the local-ether wave equation leads to the speed-dependences in the angular\nfrequency and wavelength of matter wave, in the mass of particle, and in the energy of\nquantum states. Thus it provides the physical origin of the postulates of de Broglie and the\nLorentz mass-variation law. Moreover, it accounts for the east-west directional anisotropy\nin the Hafele-Keating experiment, the synchronism in GPS, and for the spatial isotropy in\nthe Hughes-Drever experiment. It also leads to the electromagnetic force law in conjunction\nwith the physical origin of the inertial mass. Thus the local-ether wave equation and the\nmodified Schr\u00f6dinger equation account for a variety of phenomena in a consistent way.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.C. Su, Eur. Phys. J.
