E. Avron and L. Sadun\u2217\nDepartment of Physics, Technion, 32000 Haifa, Israel\nOctober 22, 2018\nPACS: 73.40.Hm, also 71.10Hf, 03.65.Db\nAbstract\nThe quantized Hall conductance in a plateau is related to the index\nof a Fredholm operator. In this paper we describe the generic \"phase\ndiagram\" of Fredholm indices associated with bounded and Toeplitz\noperators. We discuss the possible relevance of our results to the phase\ndiagram of disordered integer quantum Hall systems.\n\nThe Hall conductance of Integer Quantum Hall systems is described\nmathematically by the index of Fredholm operators. (For precise definitions,\nsee below). In this paper we investigate the phase diagram of the Fredholm\nindex for a few classes of operators. For the algebra of bounded operators,\nlittle can be said beyond the fact that the phase diagrams can be arbitrarily\ncomplicated. But for the algebra of Toeplitz operators, and other related\nclasses of operators, we establish a kind of a Gibbs phase rule [1]. Typical of\nour results is the statement that if the system is governed by two parameters,\nthen one should expect jumps by one at phase boundaries and jumps by up\nto 2 at triple points, while jumps by more than two should never be observed.\nWe relate this behavior to experimental results, conjectures and open\nproblems that arise in the context of the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) [2].\nIn Section 1 we define Fredholm operators and their indices, and explore\nthe different sorts of phase diagrams that can arise. In Section 2 we recall how\nOn leave from the Department of Mathematics, University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712\nUSA\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fFredholm indices are related to the conductance of Quantum Hall systems.\nIn Section 3 we consider phase diagrams for general bounded operators. In\nSection 4 we describe the phase diagram for linear combination of shift operators, and in Section 5 we consider general Toeplitz operators. In Section\n6 we discuss the phase diagrams of soluble models related to the quantum\nHall effect, and how they might be modified by disorder. We also discuss\nthe relevance of Toeplitz operators to the Quantum Hall Effect and present\nsome open problems.\n\nI\nI.1\n\nFredholm indices\nBasic notions\n\nThe following is a brief description of Fredholm operators. For more details,\nsee [3, 4, 5].\nDefinition 1 A bounded operator F on a separable Hilbert space is Fredholm\nif there exists a bounded operator B such that 1\u2212F B and 1\u2212BF are compact.\nThe Fredholm index is defined by\nIndex(F ) = dim Ker(F ) \u2212 dim Ker(F \u2020 ).\n\n(1)\n\nThe simplest example of a Fredholm operator with nonzero index is the\nunilateral shift operator: Let e0 , e1 , e2 , . . . be the canonical basis for the\nHilbert space l2 (N), and let the operator a act by\n(\nen\u22121 if n > 0\n(2)\na(en ) =\n0\nif n = 0.\nThe reason for denoting the unilateral shift operator by a is its similarity to\nthe harmonic oscillator lowering operator. The adjoint of a acts by\na\u2020 (en ) = en+1\n\n(3)\n\nSince 1 = aa\u2020 = a\u2020 a+|e0 ihe0 |, a is Fredholm. The kernel of a is 1-dimensional\nand the kernel of a\u2020 is 0-dimensional. Thus Index (a) = 1 and Index (a\u2020 ) =\n\u22121.\n2\n\n\fAlthough neither the dimension of Ker F nor that of Ker F \u2020 is stable\nunder deformations of F , the index is stable. For any compact operator C,\nfor any bounded operator B, and for \u01eb sufficiently small, [4, 5]:\nIndex(F ) = Index(F + \u01ebB + C).\n\n(4)\n\nThe following theorem is standard:\nTheorem 1 If A1 , . . . An are Fredholm operators,\nthen the product A1 A2 * * * An\nPn\nis also Fredholm, and Index(A1 * * * An ) = i=1 Index(Ai ).\n\nIf F and F \u2032 are Fredholm operators on the same Hilbert space, then\nthere is a continuous path of Fredholm operators from F to F \u2032 if and only\nif Index(F ) = Index(F \u2032 ). (By continuous, we mean relative to the operator norm). Put another way, the path components of F red(H), the space\nof Fredholm operators on H, are indexed by the integers. The n-th path\ncomponent is precisely the set of Fredholm operators of index n [4].\n\nI.2\n\nPhase diagrams\n\nOur main concern in this paper is the following problem: Suppose one interpolates between Fredholm operators with different indices. What can one say\nabout the way the indices change? Another way of phrasing this is: What is\nthe phase diagram of Fredholm indices?\nThe answer to this question depends on the choice of the embedding\nspace. In the space of bounded operators, the \"phases\"-each labeled by its\nindex-are open sets. But the boundary between phases, as we shall explain,\nis rather wild: A point on the boundary of one phase is also on the boundary\nof every other phase. This behavior is difficult to visualize.\nAnother class of embedding spaces that we consider is associated with\nToeplitz operators with various regularity assumptions on a class of functions.\nHere, at least if the functions are sufficiently smooth, the boundaries between\nphases have a simple structure and the phase diagrams satisfy simple rules\nthat have the flavor of Gibbs' phase rule [1]. Typical of our results is the\nstatement that under appropriate conditions, phases whose indices differ by\none have a common boundary whose codimension is one, and phases whose\nindices differ by two meet on a set of codimension two etc. Fig. 1 is an\nexample of one of the phase diagrams we obtain.\n\n3\n\n\fII\n\nThe Hall conductance as a Fredholm Index\n\nTheories of the quantum Hall effect are roughly of two kinds: those that focus\non the bulk of the Hall and those that focus on the edge [2]. It was pointed\nout by [6] that the bulk-edge duality is an illustration of the holographic\nprinciple. In either approach, the quantized Hall conductance can be related\nto a Fredholm index.\n\nII.1\n\nTheories of the bulk\n\nIt is common knowledge that the Hall conductance can be identified with\na Chern number [7]. For non-interacting electrons in two dimensions, this\nresult is a special case of the fact that the Hall conductance is a Fredholm\nindex. Since this is not common knowledge, we recall how Chern numbers\nand Fredholm indices are related.\nFor non-interacting electrons in two dimensions with the Fermi energy\nin a gap, TKN2 , showed that the Hall conductance for Landau Hamiltonians\nwith periodic potential, is related to a Chern number [8]. The (magnetic)\nBrillouin zone associated with the periodicity plays an role in this theory.\nBecause of this, the interpretation of the Hall conductance as a Chern number does not carry over to random or even quasi-periodic potentials nor to\n\"irrational magnetic fields\", all of which have no (classical) Brillouin zone.\nAlthough the quantization of the Hall conductance can be established in\nthese cases by a limiting argument [9, 7], the interpretation as a Chern number does not survive.\nJ. Bellissard [10], in a work that had impact on non-commutative geometry [11, 12], showed that the Hall conductance with ergodic potential,\nbe it periodic, quasi-periodic or random, and real magnetic field, rational\nor not, is a Fredholm index. This result was derived in [13] without using\nnon-commutative geometry.\nMore precisely, consider the (infinite dimensional) spectral projection P\non the states below the Fermi energy EF for the one particle Hamiltonian in\nthe plane. Let U be the multiplication operator ei\u03b8 , where \u03b8 is the usual polar\nangle in the plane. U is a singular gauge transformation that introduces an\nAharonov-Bohm flux tube at the origin of the Euclidean plane. The Hall\nconductance is the Fredholm index of P UP thought of as an operator on the\nrange of P [14]. Since the Fredholm index does not need a Brillouin zone,\nthis approach offers a natural framework that accounts for the quantization\n4\n\n\fand stability of the Hall conductance.\n\nII.2\n\nTheories of the edge\n\nFinite quantum Hall systems have chiral edge currents [15, 16]. Consider\nthe case that the boundary is a circle of circumference L. The dispersion\nrelation of the edge states is approximately linear in a small neighborhood of\nthe Fermi energy and the Hamiltonian for a single edge channel, with velocity\nvF , is\nH = \u2212i\n\nvF\n\u2202\u03b8\nL\n\n(5)\n\nNow, the projection P is associated with the occupied edge states, e\u2212im\u03b8\nwith m \u2265 m0 . Introducing a flux tube into the system is associated with the\nunitary U = ei\u03b8 and sends H \u2192 UHU \u2020 . This leads to the spectral flow of\nthe edge states. P UP is the unilateral shift operator a and the number of\nedge states that cross the Fermi energy is Index P UP = 1. By an argument\nof Halperin [15] this is also the Hall conductance.\nAn extension of this idea to Harper models with an edge is described in\n[17].\n\nIII\n\nThe phase diagram for bounded operators\n\nWe begin with the space of bounded operators with the topology defined\nby the operator norm, and we wish to understand the phase diagram of a\ngeneric family of such operators. As we shall explain, the phase diagram in\nthe entire space is quite wild: Any point on the boundary of the \"index =\nk\" phase is also on the boundary of every other phase.\nTo understand this bizarre behavior, recall that the zero operator (which\nis not a Fredholm operator) is on the boundary of every phase: Zero is the\nlimit, as \u03b5 \u2192 0, of \u03b5an , with a of Eq. (2), for any n. The point of the theorem\nis that similar behavior occurs at all boundary points.\nTheorem 2 Let Un be the set of Fredholm operators of index n. Every point\non the boundary of Un is also on the boundary of Um , for every integer m.\n\n5\n\n\fProof: Let A be a (not Fredholm) operator on the boundary of Un . Given\n\u01eb > 0, we must find an operator in Um within a distance \u01eb of A.\nSuppose that the kernel and cokernel of A are infinite dimensional, and\nthat there is a gap in the spectrum of A\u2020 A at zero. (If this is not the case,\nwe may perturb A by an arbitrarily small amount to make it so). Now let B\nbe a unitary map from the kernel of A to the cokernel. Let P, (P \u2032 ) be the\northogonal projection onto ker(A), (coker(A)), and let a be a shift operator\non ker(A). For each m \u2265 0, A(\u01eb) = A + \u01ebBam P has a bounded right inverse\nA\u2020\n\n1\n1 \u2020 m \u2020 \u2032\n\u2032\nP\n+\n(a ) B P .\n\u22a5\nP \u2032 + AA\u2020\n\u01eb\n\n(6)\n\nIt follows that the cokernel of A(\u01eb) is empty. It is easy to see that the kernel\nof A(\u01eb) is m dimensional hence Index(A(\u01eb)) = m. Similarly, A + \u01ebB(a\u2020 )m P\nhas index \u2212m.\n\nIV\n\nLinear combinations of shifts\n\nIn this section and the next we show that there are interesting and simple \"generic\" phase diagrams of Fredholm indices in some finite dimensional\nspaces, and in some infinite-dimensional spaces with sufficiently fine topologies. We shall also see also how control is lost as the space is enlarged and\nthe topology is coarsened.\n\nIV.1\n\nShift by one\n\nWe begin by considering linear combinations of the shift operator a and the\nidentity operator 1. That is, we consider the operator\nA = c1 a + c0\nwhere c1 and c0 are constants.\nTheorem 3 If |c1 | =\n6 |c0 |, then A is Fredholm. The index of A is 1 if\n|c1 | > |c0 | and zero if |c1 | < |c0 |. If |c1 | = |c0 |, then A is not Fredholm.\nProof: First suppose |c0 | > |c1 |. Then A is invertible:\n\u22121\nA\u22121 = c\u22121\n=\n0 (1 + (c1 /c0 )a)\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u22121)n cn\n1\n\nn=0\n\n6\n\ncn+1\n0\n\nan ,\n\n\fas the sum converges absolutely. Thus A has neither kernel nor cokernel, and\nhas index zero.\nIf |c1 |P\n> |c0 |, then the kernel of A is 1-dimensional, namely all multiples\nn\nof |\u03c8i = \u221e\nn=0 z0 en , where z0 = \u2212c0 /c1 . Notice how the norm of |\u03c8i goes\nto infinity as |z0 | \u2192 1. However, A\u2020 has no kernel, since for any unit vector\n|\u03c6i, kA\u2020 |\u03c6ik = kc\u03041 a\u2020 |\u03c6i + c\u03040|\u03c6ik \u2265 kc\u03041 a\u2020 |\u03c6ik \u2212 kc\u03040|\u03c6ik = |c1 | \u2212 |c0 |. Thus the\nindex of A is 1.\nIf |c1 | = |c0 |, then A is at the boundary between index 1 and index 0,\nand so cannot be Fredholm.\n\nIV.2\n\nFinite linear combinations of shifts\n\nNext we consider linear combinations of 1, a, a2 , . . . up to some fixed an .\nThat is, we consider operators of the form\nA = cn an + cn\u22121 an\u22121 + * * * + c0 .\n\n(7)\n\nThis is closely related to the polynomial\np(z) = cn z n + * * * + c0 .\n\n(8)\n\nTheorem 4 If none of the roots of p lie on the unit circle, then A is Fredholm, and the index of A equals the number of roots of p inside the unit circle,\ncounted with multiplicity. If any of the roots of p lie on the unit circle, then\nA is not Fredholm.\nQ\nProof: The polynomial p(z) factorizes as p(z) = ck ki=1 (z \u2212 \u03b6i ), where k is\nthe degree\nQk of p (typically k = n, but it may happen that cn = 0). But then\nA = ck i=1 (a \u2212 \u03b6i ). If none of the roots \u03b6i lie on the unit circle, then each\nterm in the product is Fredholm, so the product is Fredholm, and the index\nof the product is the sum of the indices of the factors. By Theorem 3, this\nexactly equals the number of roots \u03b6i inside the unit circle.\nIf any of the roots lie on the unit circle, then a small perturbation can\npush those roots in or out, yielding Fredholm operators with different indices.\nThis borderline operator therefore cannot be Fredholm.\nThe last theorem easily generalizes to linear combination of left-shifts\nand right-shifts. The index of an operator\nA = cn an + * * * + c1 a + c0 + c\u22121 a\u2020 + * * * + c\u2212m (a\u2020 )m\n7\n\n(9)\n\n\fequals the number of roots of\np(z) =\n\nn\nX\n\nci z i\n\n(10)\n\ni=\u2212m\n\ninside the unit circle, minus the degree of the pole at z = 0 (that is m, unless\nc\u2212m = 0). This follow from the fact that\nA=(\n\nn\nX\n\nci ai+m )(a\u2020 )m .\n\n(11)\n\ni=\u2212m\n\nSince there is no qualitative difference between combinations of left-shifts\nand combinations of both left- and right-shifts, we restrict our attention to\nleft-shifts only, and consider families of operators of the form (7).\nTheorem 5 In the space of complex linear combinations of 1, a, . . . , an ,\nalmost every operator is Fredholm. For every k \u2264 n, the points where the\nindex can jump by k (by which we mean the common boundaries of regions\nof Fredholm operators whose indices differ by k) is a set of real codimension\nk.\nIn the space of real linear combinations of 1, a, . . . , an , almost every\noperator is Fredholm. For every k \u2264 n, the points where the index jumps\nby k is a stratified space, the largest stratum of which has real codimension\n\u230a(k + 1)/2\u230b, where \u230ax\u230b denotes the integer part of x.\nProof: Our parameter space is the space of coefficients ci , or equivalently the\n| n+1 , depending\nspace of polynomials of degree \u2264 n. This is either IRn+1 or C\non whether we allow real or complex coefficients. In either case, the set Uk\nof Fredholm operators of index k is identical to the set of polynomials with k\nroots inside the unit circle and the remaining n \u2212 k roots outside (if cn = 0,\nwe say there is a root at infinity; if cn = cn\u22121 = 0, there is a double root at\ninfinity, and so on. Counting these roots at infinity, there are always exactly\nn roots in all.) The boundary of Uk is the set of polynomials with at most k\nroots inside the unit circle, at most n \u2212 k outside the unit circle, and at least\none root on the unit circle. (Strictly speaking, the zero polynomial is also\non this boundary. This is of such high codimension that it has no effect on\nthe phase portrait we are developing.). We consider the common boundary\nof Uk and Uk\u2032 . If k < k \u2032 , a nonvanishing polynomial is on the boundary of\n8\n\n\f8\n\n6\n\n2\nc0=c1 /4\n\nIndex = 0\n4\n\n2\n\nIndex = 2\n\nc0=0\n\nIndex = 1\n\nIndex = 1\n\n-2\n\nIndex = 0\n\n-4\n\n-6\n-4\n\n-2\n\nc1=0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFigure 1: A phase diagram for the Fredholm index of F = a2 + c1 a + c0 .\nboth Uk and Uk\u2032 if it has at most k roots inside the unit circle and at most\nn \u2212 k \u2032 roots outside. It must therefore have at least k \u2032 \u2212 k roots on the unit\ncircle.\nIf we are working with complex coefficients, this is a set of codimension\nk \u2032 \u2212k. The roots themselves, together with an overall scale cn , can be used to\nparametrize the space of polynomials. For each root, being on the unit circle\nis codimension 1, while being inside or outside are open conditions. Since the\nroots are independent, placing k \u2032 \u2212 k roots on the unit circle is codimension\nk \u2032 \u2212 k.\nIf we are working with real coefficients, the roots are not independent, as\nnon-real roots come in complex conjugate pairs. Thus, the common boundary\nof Uk and Uk\u2032 breaks into several strata, depending on how many real roots\nand how many complex conjugate pairs lie on the unit circle. If k \u2032 \u2212k is even,\nthe biggest stratum consists of having (k \u2032 \u2212 k)/2 pairs, and has codimension\n(k \u2032 \u2212k)/2. If k \u2032 \u2212k is odd, the biggest stratum consists of having (k \u2032 \u2212k\u22121)/2\npairs and one real root on the unit circle, and has codimension (k \u2032 + 1 \u2212 k)/2.\n\n9\n\n\fTheorem 5 is illustrated in Figure 1, where the phase portrait is shown\nfor n = 2 with real coefficients, with c2 fixed to equal 1. The points above\nthe parabola c0 = c21 /4 have complex conjugate roots, while points below\nhave real roots. Notice that the transition from index 2 to index 0 occurs at\nan isolated point when the roots are real, but on an interval when the roots\ncome in complex-conjugate pairs.\nIt is clear that an almost identical theorem applies to linear combinations\nof left-shifts up to an and right-shifts up to (a\u2020 )m . The results are essentially\nindependent of n and m (their only effect being to limit the size of possible\njumps to n + m). We can therefore extend the results to the space of all\n(finite) linear combinations of left- and right-shifts, which is topologized as\nthe union over all n and m of the spaces considered above. Our result,\nrestated for that space, is\nTheorem 6 In the space of finite complex linear combinations of left- and\nright-shifts of arbitrary degree, almost every operator is Fredholm. For every\ninteger k \u2265 1, the points where the index can jump by k (by which we mean\nthe common boundaries of regions of Fredholm operators whose indices differ\nby k) is a set of real codimension k.\nIf we restrict the coefficients to be real, then, for every k \u2264 n, the points\nwhere the index jumps by k is a stratified space, the largest stratum of which\nhas real codimension \u230a(k + 1)/2\u230b.\n\nV\n\nToeplitz operators\n\nAlthough Theorem 6 refers to an infinite-dimensional space, this space is still\nextremely small \u2013 each point is a finite linear combination of shifts. In this\nsection we consider infinite linear combinations of shifts. This is equivalent\nto studying Toeplitz operators.\nDefinition 2 The Hardy space H is the subspace of L2 (S 1 ) consisting of\nfunctions whose Fourier transforms have no negative frequency terms. Equivalently, if we give L2 (S 1 ) a basis of Fourier modes en = ein\u03b8 , where the integer\nn ranges from \u2212\u221e to \u221e, then H is the closed linear span of e0 , e1 , e2 , . . . .\nWe think of S 1 as sitting in the complex plane, with z = ei\u03b8 . Now let\nf (z) be a bounded, measurable function on S 1 , and let P be the orthogonal\n10\n\n\fprojection from L2 (S 1 ) to H. If |\u03c8i \u2208 H, then |f \u03c8i (pointwise product) is\nin L2 (S 1 ), and P |f \u03c8i \u2208 H. We define the operator Tf by\nTf |\u03c8i = P |f \u03c8i.\n\n(12)\n\nDefinition 3 An operator of the form (12) is called a Toeplitz operator.\nWe call a Toeplitz operator Tf continuous if the underlying function f is\ncontinuous, and apply the terms \"differentiable\", \"smooth\" and \"analytic\"\nsimilarly.\nRemark: Toeplitz operators can be represented by semi-infinite matrices\nthat have constant entries on diagonals, and the various classes we have\ndefined correspond to the decay away from the main diagonal.\nNotice that\n(\nen+m if n + m \u2265 0\n(13)\nTem en =\n0\notherwise\nso Tem is simply a shift by m, a right shift if m > 0 and a left-shift if\nm < 0. All our results about shifts can therefore be understood in the\ncontext of Toeplitz operators. Theorem 5 refers to operators Tf , where f\nis a polynomial in z \u22121 of limited degree. Theorem 6 considers polynomials\nor arbitrary degree in z and z \u22121 . We will see that the results carry over to\nanalytic functions on an annulus around S 1 , and to a lesser extent to C k\nToeplitz operators, but with results that weaken as k is decreased.\nHere are some standard results about Toeplitz operators. For details, see\n[4].\nTheorem 7 A C 1 Toeplitz operator Tf is Fredholm if and only if f is everywhere nonzero on the unit circle. In that case the index of Tf is minus the\nwinding number of f around the origin, namely\nZ\n\u22121\ndf\nIndex(Tf ) = \u2212W inding(f ) =\n,\n(14)\n2\u03c0i S 1 f\nGiven the first half of the theorem, the equality of index and winding\nnumber is easy to understand. We simply deform f to a function of the form\nf (z) = z n , while keeping f nonzero on all of S 1 throughout the deformation\n(this is always possible, see e.g. [18]). In the process of deformation, neither\n11\n\n\fthe index of Tf nor the winding number of f can change, as they are topological invariants. Since the winding number of z n is n, and since Tz n = (a\u2020 )n\n(if n \u2265 0, a\u2212n otherwise), which has index \u2212n, the result follows.\nWe now consider functions f on S 1 that can be analytically continued\n(without singularities) to an annulus r0 \u2264 |z| \u2264 r1 , where the radii r0 < 1 and\nr1 > 1 are fixed. This is equivalent to requiring that the Fourier coefficients\nf\u02c6n decay exponentially fast, i.e. that the sum\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n|f\u02c6n |(r0n + r1n )\n\n(15)\n\nconverges. For now we do not impose any reality constraints or other symmetries on the coefficients f\u02c6n . This space of functions is a Banach space, with\nnorm given by the sup norm on the annulus. This norm is stronger than any\nSobolev norm on the circle itself.\nThe analysis of the corresponding Toeplitz operators is straightforward\nand similar to the proof of Theorem 5. Since f has no poles in the annulus,\nwe just have to keep track of the zeroes of f . For the index of Tf to change,\na zero of f must cross the unit circle. For the index to jump from k to k \u2032 ,\n|k \u2212 k \u2032 | zeroes must cross simultaneously. In the absence of symmetry, the\nlocations of the zeroes are independent and can be freely varied, so this is a\ncodimension-|k \u2212 k \u2032 | event.\nIf we impose a reality condition: f (z\u0304) = f (z), then zeroes appear only\non the real axis or in complex conjugate pairs. In that case, changing the\nindex by 2 is merely a codimension-1 event. Combining these observations\nwe obtain\nTheorem 8 In the space of Toeplitz operators that are analytic in a (fixed)\nannulus containing S 1 , almost every operator is Fredholm. For every integer\nk \u2265 1, the points where the index can jump by k is a set of real codimension\nk.\nIf we impose a reality condition f (z\u0304) = f (z) then, for every k \u2264 n, the\npoints where the index jumps by k is a stratified space, the largest stratum of\nwhich has real codimension \u230a(k + 1)/2\u230b.\nFinally we consider Toeplitz operators that are not necessarily analytic,\nbut are merely l times differentiable, and we use the C l norm. Our result is\n\n12\n\n\fTheorem 9 In the space of Toeplitz C l operators, almost every operator is\nFredholm. For every integer k with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2l+1, the points where the index\ncan jump by k is a set of real codimension k. For every integer k \u2265 2l + 1,\nthe points where the index can jump by k is a set of real codimension 2l + 1.\nIn other words, our familiar results hold up to codimension 2l + 1, at\nwhich point we lose all control of the change in index.\nProof: As long as f is everywhere nonzero, Tf is Fredholm. To get a change\nin index, therefore, we need one or more points where f , and possibly some\nderivatives of f with respect to \u03b8, vanish. Suppose then that for some angle\n\u03b80 , f (\u03b80 ) = f \u2032 (\u03b80 ) = * * * = f (n\u22121) (\u03b80 ) = 0 for some n \u2264 l, but that the n-th\nderivative f (n) (\u03b80 ) 6= 0. This is a codimension 2n \u2212 1 event, since we are\nsetting the real and imaginary parts of n variables to zero, but have a 1parameter choice of points where this can occur. Without loss of generality,\nwe suppose that this n-th derivative is real and positive. By making a C l small perturbation of f , we can make the value of f highly oscillatory near\n\u03b80 , thereby wrapping around the origin a number of times. However, since a\nC l -small perturbation does not change the n-th derivative by much, the sign\nof the real part of f can change at most n times near \u03b80 , so the argument of\nf can only increase or decrease by n\u03c0 or less. The difference between these\ntwo extremes is 2n\u03c0, or a change in winding number of n.\nTo change the index by an integer m, therefore, we must have the function\nvanish to various orders at several points, with the sum of the orders of\nvanishing adding to m. The generic event is for f (but not f \u2032 ) to vanish\nat m different points \u2013 this is a codimension m event, analogous to having\nm zeroes of a polynomial cross the unit circle simultaneously at m different\npoints. All other scenarios have higher codimension and are analogous to\nhaving 2 or more zeroes of the m zeroes crossing the unit circle at the same\npoint.\nThe situation is different, however, when the function f and the first l\nderivatives all vanish at a point \u03b80 . Then the higher-order derivatives are not\nprotected from C l -small perturbations and, by making such a perturbation,\nwe can change f into a function that is identically zero on a small neighborhood of \u03b8 = \u03b80 . By making a further small perturbation, we can make f wrap\naround the origin as many times as we like near \u03b8 = \u03b80 . More specifically, if\nf is zero on an interval of size \u03b4, then, for small \u01eb, f \u0303(\u03b8) = f (\u03b8) + \u01ebeiN \u03b8 will\nwrap around the origin approximately N\u03b4/2\u03c0 times near \u03b80 . By picking N as\nlarge (positive or negative) as we wish, we can obtain arbitrarily positive or\n13\n\n\fE\n-2\n\n-3 -4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nB\nFigure 2: The phase diagram for the Landau Hamiltonian in the Euclidean\nplane.

As long as we take \u01eb \u226a N \u2212l , this perturbation will remain\nsmall in the C l norm.\nThe results of this section can be extended, with minor modifications, to\nthe algebra of matrix valued Toeplitz operators [4] where the index is related\nto the winding of the determinant of a matrix.\n\nVI\nVI.1\n\nQuantum Hall systems\nPhase diagrams of soluble models\n\nPhase diagrams of quantum Hall system describe the dependence of the Hall\nconductance on parameters such as the magnetic field B and the Fermi energy E. There are three idealized models where the phase diagram can be\ncomputed explicitly: The Landau Hamiltonian in the Euclidean plane, whose\nphase diagram is shown in Fig. 2; The Landau Hamiltonian for the hyperbolic plane, whose phase diagram is shown in Fig. 3 and Harper models in\nthe plane [19, 8], whose phase diagram is associated with the Hofstadter\nbutterfly, shown in Fig. 4 for the case of a tight binding model on a square\nlattice.\nThese are not models of Toeplitz operators, and none of these models\n14\n\n\fE\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0\nB\n\nFigure 3: The phase diagram for the Landau Hamiltonian in the hyperbolic\nplane. In the shaded parabolic region the operator is not Fredholm and the\nindex is nor defined.\nis generic, especially insofar as all of them have symmetries. However, we\nconsider the extent to which they follow the generic phase rules of (smooth,\ncomplex) Toeplitz operators anyway. Where these rules are not followed, we\nconsider how a small generic perturbation might restore the rules.\nThe phase diagram for the Euclidean plane, Fig. 2 satisfies the generic\nphase rules away from the line B = 0. On the line B = 0, however, the index\ntakes an infinitely large jump, while at the origin infinitely many phases\nmeet. Both are forbidden by the phase rules.\nThe phase diagram in the hyperbolic plane, Fig. 3, satisfies the generic\nphase rules outside the shaded parabolic region. In the shaded region, the\noperator is not Fredholm and the index is not defined. This is contrary to\nthe phase rules since not being Fredholm is expected to be a codimension 1\nevent.\nThe phase diagram of the Harper model, Fig. 4, is in serious conflict\nwith the phase rule for (smooth, complex) Toeplitz operators: It is known\n[20], that for a full measure of values of the magnetic field (irrational, of\ncourse), the spectrum is a Cantor set. Since the boundary between phases\nis contained in the spectrum, this suggests that any point on the boundary\nbetween any two phases can also be on the boundary between infinitely many\nother phases. This is the sort of behavior we observed for bounded operators\nwith no restrictions. However, even in this wildness there is some regularity.\n15\n\n\f6\n\n-3\n\n3\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n5\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n1\n\nFlux\n\n4\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n-3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n-3\n\n1\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n3\n\n-3\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\nEnergy\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFigure 4: The phase diagram for the Harper model associated with tight\nbinding model on a square lattice the plane.

In the Harper model\nit is known [22] that all gaps except possibly for the central gap, are open.\nFinally, consider the phase diagram of the Harper model with a disordered potential. This is not soluble in the same sense that the previous\nmodels are, but there are numerical results for it. Fig. 5, which we borrowed\nfrom [23], shows the phase diagram for a split Landau level in the Harper\nmodel with disorder. More precisely, the diagram describes a Harper model\nwith fractional flux 85 through a unit cell.\nWithout disorder the conductance \u03c3 of each isolated band satisfies the\nDiophantine equation similar to Eq. 16, except that for a split Landau band\np and q are interchanged. For flux 85 the Diophantine equation fixes the\nconductances (2, \u22123, 2) of the bands at the flanks and \u22121 at the center. Zero\ndisorder is, of course, not generic, and, indeed, there are bands on the E axis\nwhere the index is not defined, something that the phase rules for Toeplitz\n17\n\n\fforbid. Under perturbation the diagram should might so that these bands\nwhere the index is not defined disappear. This is indeed the case. The\ndiagram in [23] is obtained by drawing n lines emanating from each band\nwhere n is its Hall conductance.\nIn summary, the wild character of the phase diagram of the Harper model\nis tamed by disorder and one finds, remarkably, a phase diagram compatible\nwith the phase rules for Toeplitz operators.\n\nVI.2\n\nPerturbations of Landau Hamiltonians\n\nMotivated by the effect of disorder on the Harper model phase portrait, we\nnext consider the effect of perturbations on the phase portraits of Landau\nHamiltonians. Such perturbations will modify the phase diagram near phase\nboundaries. As a consequence one expects a phase diagram to be qualitatively modified near points of accumulation of phases, even if the perturbation\nis small.\nFigures 2 and 3 satisfy the phase rules in the region of large magnetic\nfields, but fail to do so for small magnetic fields. We now examine how the\ntwo figures might be modified to satisfy the phase rules everywhere.\nThe phase diagram of the Landau Hamiltonian in the plane, Fig. 2 will\nbe significantly modified near the line B = 0 which, by symmetry, must lie in\na region with index 0. A schematic phase diagram that is generic and close\nto the Landau phase diagram is shown in Fig. 6.\nThe phase diagram in Fig. 3 has a region of full measure, the shaded\nparabola, where the operator is not Fredholm. This is non-generic, and\nunstable. A perturbation might produce a phase diagram like 7. Note that\nthe two perturbed diagrams, Fig. 6 and 7 are topologically identical.\nHow do the phase diagrams, Figs. 6 and 7, compare with what one finds\nin experiments on the quantum Hall effect? For large magnetic fields one finds\nphase diagrams that resemble both Figs. 2 and 6 and satisfy the phase rules.\nFor weak magnetic fields one observes a transition to an insulating phase. The\nemergence of an insulating phase (with index 0) for small magnetic fields is\nin agreement with the phase rule and Fig. 6. However, some experiments [24]\nand numerical simulations [25] have been interpreted as giving evidence to\ndirect transitions from a Hall conductance of 2 and 3 to the insulating phase.\nTaken literally, such transitions would violate the phase rule. However, these\nresults may merely indicate that, for B small, the phase boundaries of Fig.\n6 are too closely spaced to be distinguished numerically and experimentally.\n18\n\n\fE\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n0\nB\n\nFigure 6: A phase diagram that satisfies the phase rules of Toeplitz operators\nand is a perturbation of the phase diagram of Landau Hamiltonian in the\nplane.\n\nE\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n0\n\nB\n\nFigure 7: A phase diagram that satisfies the rules of Toeplitz operators and is\na perturbation of the phase diagram of Landau Hamiltonian in the hyperbolic\nplane.\n\n19\n\n\fVI.3\n\nToeplitz operators\n\nThe main gap in our analysis is that we have not established a direct relation\nbetween the algebra of Toeplitz operators, where our phase rules are proven,\nand the class of operators relevant to (disordered) quantum Hall systems.\nAt the minimum, Toeplitz operators serve as a natural mathematical laboratory. However, there is a more direct justification for considering Toeplitz\noperators. The most elementary paradigm for a quantum Hall system is the\nLandau Hamiltonian, in which case one has:\nTheorem 10 Let P be a projection on the lowest Landau level in IR2 , and let\nU be the gauge transformation associated with an Aharonov-Bohm flux tube\nat the origin. Then P UP , acting on the range of P , differs from a Toeplitz\noperator by a compact operator.\nProof: A basis for the lowest Landau level is\n|ni = \u221a\n\n1\n2\nz n e\u2212|z| /2 ,\n\u03c0 n!\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(17)\n\nAs a consequence\nhn|U|mi = \u03b4n,m+1\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(m + 1/2)!\n\u221a\n.\n\u2248 \u03b4n,m+1 1 \u2212\n8m\nm! m + 1\n\n(18)\n\nIn this case, a compact perturbation of P UP is not only a Toeplitz\noperator; it is a simple shift. However, if the flux tube is placed at a different\npoint, or if the magnetic field is spread out over a finite region, then we obtain\na more general Toeplitz operator. If P is a projection on a higher Landau\nlevel, the same results hold but the calculation is more involved. If P is a\nprojection onto multiple Landau levels, then P UP is a compact perturbation\nof a direct sum of Toeplitz operators, one for each Landau level.\nThis is not to say that Toeplitz operators apply directly to all systems,\nonly that they apply to many. There are basic models where P UP fails\nto be Toeplitz. Indeed, an elementary model for localization is a random\nmultiplication operator, i.e. H = V\u03c9 on l(Zd ). This is a caricature of strong\ndisorder. The eigenfunctions are now concentrated at lattice points. The\nprojection P (below a Fermi energy) is\nX\nP =\n|nihn|,\n(19)\n20\n\n\fwhere the sum is over a random set of lattice points with, V\u03c9 (n) < E, in Zd .\nP UP is now a multiplication by a phase. It is an invertible operator and has\nFredholm index zero. It is, however, not Toeplitz.\n\nVI.4\n\nOpen problems\n\nIt is tempting to directly study the index of P UP , for spectral projections P\nand unitary operators U, rather than rely on generic results based on Toeplitz\noperators. There are, however, several technical obstacles. The first is that\nP UP is thought of as acting on Range P , which is a Hilbert space in its\nown right. This means that a deformation of the parameters of the system\nleads to a deformation of the space Range P . In contrast, our strategy so\nfar is formulated on a fixed space. The second obstacle is that our results\ndepend on continuity properties while spectral projections tend to have bad\ncontinuity properties that come from a discontinuity at the Fermi energy.\nTo overcome the first problem one can replace P UP by an operator F\ndefined on the entire Hilbert space with coinciding index. There is large\narbitrariness in choosing F , but a natural choice is:\nF = P UP + P\u22a5 = P UP + P\u22a52 = 1 + P (U \u2212 1)P,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere P\u22a5 = 1 \u2212 P .\nTo overcome the second problem one may want to replace P by a Fermi\nfunction. That is, replace P by a smooth version\nP (\u03b2, B, EF ) =\n\n1\n.\nexp(\u03b2(H(B) \u2212 EF )) + 1\n\n(21)\n\nIn that case, however, P 2 is no longer equal to P , and the different expressions\nfor F in equation (20) are no longer equivalent. For each choice, it would be\ninteresting to derive a phase portrait for index(F ) as the temperature, Fermi\nenergy, magnetic field and degree of randomness are varied.\n\nVI.5\n\nConcluding remark\n\nIn this paper we explored what can be said about generic phase diagrams of\nindices of Fredholm operators. We did not use the fact that the Fredholm\noperators relevant to the quantum Hall effect are of the form P UP , with P a\nspectral projection of an ergodic Schr\u00f6dinger operator. Rather, we considered\n21\n\n\fthe index of several natural classes (and algebras) of operators. The weakness\nof this strategy is that we can not say much that is definitive about quantum\nHall systems. In its defense, we recall that replacing the particular by the\ngeneric proved to be useful in quantum physics in the hands of Wigner, von\nNeuman and Dyson [26, 27, 28]. Whether it will turn out to be useful for\nquantum Hall effect remains to be seen.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank A. Kamenev for drawing our attention to ref [29], and E. Park, M.\nReznikov, H.
