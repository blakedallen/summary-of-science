The value of the blue fraction is observed to\ndepend on the luminosity limit adopted, cluster-centric radius and, more generally,\nlocal galaxy density, but it does not depend on cluster properties. Changes in the blue\nfraction are due to variations in the relative proportions of red and blue galaxies but\nthe star formation rate for these two galaxy groups remains unchanged. Our results\nare most consistent with a model where the star formation rate declines rapidly and\nthe blue galaxies tend to be dwarfs and do not favour mechanisms where the ButcherOemler effect is caused by processes specific to the cluster environment.\nKey words:\ngalaxies:clusters - galaxies: formation and evolution\n\n1\n\n\u22c6\n\npropris@mso.anu.edu.au\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe observation by Butcher & Oemler (1984) that clusters\nof galaxies contain a larger fraction of blue galaxies at pro-\n\n\f2\n\nRoberto De Propris et al.\n\ngressively higher redshift (the Butcher-Oemler effect) contributed to the establishment of the current view of clusters\nas sites of active galaxy evolution, in which environmental\ninfluences dramatically alter the morphologies and star formation histories of their members.\nHowever, as the number of clusters observed has increased, it has become clear that the Butcher-Oemler effect\nis not solely or simply an evolutionary trend. The large scatter observed in the blue fractions for clusters in narrow redshift ranges (Smail et al. 1998; Margoniner & de Carvalho\n2000; Goto et al. 2003a) implies the existence of environmental effects, which may compete with, and possibly\nmimic, evolutionary trends, if the cluster samples evolve\nwith redshift.\nStudies of the original Butcher-Oemler sample lend support to this scenario: Newberry et al. (1988) measured the\nsurface densities and velocity dispersions of seven ButcherOemler clusters and found that the high and low redshift\nsample differ. Andreon & Ettori (1999) show that the Xray luminosity of high redshift Butcher-Oemler clusters is\nhigher than that of low redshift clusters, although the X-ray\nluminosity function of clusters does not evolve to z \u223c 0.8\n(Holden et al. 2002), arguing that the high redshift sample\ndoes not represent the progenitors of modern-day clusters.\nSimilarly, both Smail et al. (1998) and Fairley et al. (2002)\nfind a low blue fraction in their samples of X-ray selected\nclusters.\nThe blue fraction has also been observed to depend\non a number of other factors, such as: the luminosity limit\nused and the cluster centric distance (Ellingson et al. 2001;\nGoto et al. 2003a), richness (Margoniner et al. 2001), cluster concentration (Butcher & Oemler 1984) and, possibly,\nthe presence of substructure (Metevier et al. 2000). These\nfindings point to the necessity of understanding environmental effects on the blue fraction in order to disentangle\nevolutionary trends from selection biases in studies of clusters at high redshift.\nThe aim of the present paper is to study how the fraction of blue galaxies varies as a function of cluster properties\nand in the field at the same redshift in the local universe,\nin order to analyse the effects of environment in isolation\nfrom the evolutionary trends that give rise to the ButcherOemler effect. Lewis et al. (2002) and Balogh et al. (2003)\nhave recently discussed how the star formation rate, as measured from the H\u03b1 equivalent width, varies with environment within the 2dFGRS sample. However, colours provide\na measure of the average star formation histories over longer\ntimescales than H\u03b1 and may therefore better reflect the influence of environment on galaxy properties, especially if\nthe mechanisms responsible for the Butcher-Oemler effect\noperate on longer time frames, as is the case for harassment\n(Moore et al. 1996), for instance.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: in the next\nsection we present our analysis; selection of clusters, cluster members and a comparison field sample, definition of\nthe radial and luminosity limits used, k-corrections, colourmagnitude relations, density measurements and a discussion of how the blue fraction and its error are measured.\nThe main results are detailed in \u00a73. below and we discuss these in \u00a74. Throughout this paper we adopt a cosmology with \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. It is normal to define\nh \u2261 H0 /100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 : here we suppress the h scaling,\n\nso that the full explicit meaning of Mpc in length units is h\u22121\nMpc; for absolute magnitudes M stands for M + 5 log10 h.\n\n2\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIn this work, we analyse how the blue fraction of galaxies\nvaries as a function of cluster properties and field density\nat z < 0.11; our purpose is to provide a local reference for\nstudies of galaxy colour evolution in high redshift clusters\n(the Butcher-Oemler effect). It is therefore useful to reproduce, in our analysis, some of the features of the original\nButcher & Oemler (1984) study, as this is the basis for most\ncurrent work on the evolution of stellar populations of cluster galaxies.\nThe original analysis of Butcher & Oemler (1984) defined blue galaxies as being (i) within a radius containing 30% of the cluster population; (ii) brighter than a noevolution k\u2212corrected MV = \u221220 and (iii) bluer by 0.2 magnitudes in B \u2212 V (no-evolution and k\u2212corrected) than the\ncolour-magnitude relation defined by the cluster early-type\ngalaxies. Below we describe how we implemented these prescriptions for our dataset.\n2.1\n\nCluster and member selection\n\nThe clusters analyzed here are those studied by\nDe Propris et al. (2003a) in their paper on the composite galaxy luminosity function. This sample consists of\n60 clusters at z < 0.11 containing at least 40 spectroscopic\nmembers and with average 85% completeness. Although\nthese clusters share, to some extent, the biases of the\nAbell, APM and EDCC catalogues from which they were\noriginally drawn (see De Propris et al. 2002 for details),\nthese 60 objects provide an at least approximately complete\nand volume limited ensemble of nearby clusters, spanning a\nlarge range of properties (such as richness and velocity dispersion) determined from the same data (De Propris et al.\n2002).\nCluster membership was determined via a 'double gapping' method, as described in greater detail in\nDe Propris et al. (2002): for each putative cluster centre and\nredshift, we first required that the likely cluster members be\nsurrounded by 1000 km s\u22121 gaps on either side of the redshift distribution; we next computed a first estimate for the\nmean cz and velocity dispersion (\u03c3r ) and ranked all galaxies in order of distance from the mean cz. If galaxies had a\n'gap' in redshift space from their neighbour larger than our\nfirst estimate of \u03c3r all galaxies with a faster or slower velocity were excluded. This procedure yields a sample of cluster\nmembers which is likely to be relatively uncontaminated by\ninterlopers (i.e. field galaxies with appropriate redshift but\nnot dynamically bound to the cluster).\n2.2\n\nAperture and luminosity selection\n\nWe calculate r30 (the original aperture used by Butcher &\nOemler 1984) by using all cluster members within a 3 Mpc\nradius from the central galaxy. We then choose an aperture than includes 30% of these galaxies. It is observed that\nthe value of r30 varies depending on cluster dynamics and\ncentral concentration. For this reason it may be generally\n\n\f2dFGRS: Butcher-Oemler effect\nmore appropriate to use apertures based on cluster dynamical properties, in order to insure that all galaxies considered\nshare the same environment in all clusters. Ellingson et al.\n(2001) advocate using r200 , the radius at which the cluster\nis 200 times denser than the general field (Carlberg et al.\n1997), or its multiples. This is defined as:\n\nr200 =\n\n\u221a\n\n3\u03c3r\n10H(z)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H(z) represents the redshift-dependent Hubble constant. In the following, we will use both r200 and r200 /2 for\nour analysis.\nThe original limit by Butcher & Oemler (1984) corresponds to approximately 1.8 magnitudes below the M \u2217\npoint. Here, we use a magnitude limit 1.5 magnitudes\nfainter relative to our computed M \u2217 and we also analyse\nthe effects of using fainter limits. This allows us to study a\nmore consistent sample of galaxies in all clusters.\n\n2.3\n\nk-corrections\n\nBJ \u2212 RF colours for all 2dFGRS galaxies were derived using\ndata from the SuperCosmos survey (Hambly et al. 2001).\nGiven the colours and redshifts we derived a k-correction in\nthe following way.\nThe kcorrect package (Blanton et al. 2003a) fits a\ncombination of templates to galaxy colour data, and thus\nyields a consistent k-correction. Although only two bands\nare available for the 2dFGRS, this approach was validated\nby fitting the full DR1 ugriz data, then comparing with the\nresult of fitting gr only. The differences in K-correction are\ngenerally at the 0.01 mag. level.\nThe main problem with kcorrect is that the templates are unable to describe extremely red galaxies (BJ \u2212\nRF = 1.26 corresponding to g \u2212 r = 0.87), and so a\nconsistent k-correction cannot be obtained. In such cases,\nwe took an alternative approach, based on the models of\nBruzual & Charlot (2003). Each galaxy was modelled by a\nsingle burst, varying the age until the observed colour was\nmatched at the given redshift. This age is degenerate with\nmetallicity; in practice, we assumed 0.4 times Solar metallicity (Z = 0.008), except for very red galaxies where a current\nage of > 13 Gyr was required. In these cases, the current\nage was set at 13 Gyr and the metallicity increased until the\ncolour was matched. For red galaxies, k-corrections deduced\nin this way agree almost exactly with the results of kcorrect, and we were able to match smoothly from one to the\nother to deal with the very red galaxies that kcorrect cannot model. The results differ for extremely blue galaxies (at\nthe 0.1 mag. level), but a single burst is a rather unrealistic\nmodel in such cases and the results of kcorrect are to be\npreferred where they are consistent.\nThe fitting functions given below describe the kcorrection results for all colours of practical interest at\nz < 0.3, to within a maximum error of about 0.02 mag.\nGiven the intrinsic uncertainties in both photometric modelling and calibration, and in the interests of clarity, these\nresiduals were ignored and the fit was treated as exact.\n\n3\n\nk(BJ ) = (\u22121.63 + 4.53x)y \u2212 (4.03 + 2.01x)y 2\nz\n\u2212\n1 + (10z)4\n\n(2)\n\nk(RF ) = (\u22120.08 + 1.45x)y \u2212 (2.88 + 0.48x)y 2\n\n(3)\n\nx = BJ \u2212 RF\n\n(4)\n\ny = z/(1 + z)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\n2.4\n\nColour-magnitude relations\n\nFor all clusters, we determine the colour-magnitude relation\nby carrying out a least absolute deviation regression fit to\nthe observed colour distribution (Armstrong & Kung 1978).\nThe average observed slope is about \u22120.019 \u00b1 0.003, consistent with the relation observed in the Coma galaxies for\nV \u2212 R (Eisenhardt et al. 2004, in preparation). There appears to be some cluster-to-cluster variation in the slope, but\nthis may be due to small number statistics in some cases.\nWe carry out the same analysis for field galaxies, but we\ndivide the sample according to local density (see below for\ndetails). The slope for the field galaxies is \u223c \u22120.013 \u00b1 0.001.\nThese slopes were calculated robustly and jackknife resampling was then used to compute the errors on the values of\nthe slopes. The slopes of the relations for field and cluster\ngalaxies appear to be different at about the 2\u03c3 level, but we\ndo not regard this as compelling (cf., Hogg et al. 2004 for a\nsimilar study from Sloan colours).\nThe 2dFGRS SuperCosmos colours can be transformed\nto the SDSS g and r bands using the following equations:\nBJ = g + 0.15 + 0.13(g \u2212 r)\n\n(6)\n\nRF = r \u2212 0.13\n\n(7)\n\nA difference in B \u2212 V of 0.2 magnitudes from the ridge line\ndefined by early-type galaxies is equivalent to a 0.2 magnitude difference in g \u2212 r (Goto et al. 2003a). From the above\nequation we then derive that the corresponding difference\nin BJ \u2212 RF is 0.23 magnitudes. Fig. 1 shows the colourmagnitude relation and the colour distribution, marginalised\nover the derived colour magnitude relation, for a few representative clusters.\n2.5\n\nCalculation of local density\n\nFor field galaxies, the only relevant 'environmental' property is their local density. We calculate this by computing\nthe number of galaxies to MBJ = \u221219 in an 8 Mpc sphere\ncentred on each galaxy, with appropriate completeness corrections. A detailed description of this procedure is given\nin Croton et al. (2004). Unfortunately, this assumes that all\nradial velocities are due to the smooth Hubble flow and can\nbe used as proxies for distance. This is not applicable in the\n\n\fRoberto De Propris et al.\n\nBJ-RF\n\n2\n\nN (galaxies)\n\n4\n\nA 957 (z=0.045)\n\n1\n\nN (galaxies)\n\n0\n2\n\nBJ-RF\n\n0\n2\n\nA 3027 (z=0.077)\n\n1\n0\n2\n\nBJ-RF\n\nN (galaxies)\n\n1\n\nN (galaxies)\n\nBJ-RF\n\nA 3880 (z=0.058)\n\nA 2780 (z=0.100)\n\n1\n0\n-22\n\n-21\n\n-20\n\n-19\nMb\n\n-18\n\n-17\n\n60\n40\n20\n0\n60\n40\n20\n0\n40\n20\n0\n20\n10\n0\n-1\n\n-16\n\n0\n\u2206 (BJ-RF)\n\n-0.5\n\nJ\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFigure 1. Colour-magnitude relation (left) and histogram (right) of marginalised colour distribution (opposite each colour-magnitude\nrelation) for four representative clusters. The arrow in the histogram indicates the blue/red separation (see text)\n\ncluster environment, where the galaxies have turned around\nand no longer participate in the cosmological expansion (see,\ne.g., Cooperstock et al. 1998). For clusters, therefore, we assume that all members are effectively within r200 and calculate the density in an 8 Mpc sphere containing only cluster\nmembers. This places the density for cluster galaxies on the\nsame scale as that used for field galaxies. As we note below,\nthis is likely to be a slight underestimate of the actual density (as some members may exist beyond the virial radius).\n\n2.6\n\nCalculation of the blue fraction\n\nCalculation of the error in the derived blue fraction has been\ncarried out with a variety of recipes. Here we derive the appropriate formulation for our sample of cluster members.\nNote that if the numbers of red and blue galaxies are determined via background subtraction, extra contributions to\nthe error statistics due to clustering need to be included.\nThe blue fraction is defined as the ratio of m blue galaxies observed out of n total galaxies. Assuming that m and\nn obey Poisson statistics, the blue fraction is:\n\nL \u221d fbm (1 \u2212 fb )n\u2212m\n\nwhose maximum is, trivially, m/n. Therefore the variance\nof the blue fraction is:\n\n\u03c3 2 (fb ) =\n\n(8)\n\nand its likelihood has the same form independent of whether\nwe assume Poisson or binomial statistics (i.e. with n fixed\nin advance):\n\n\u0012\n\nd2 ln L\ndfb2\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n=\n\nm(n \u2212 m)\nn3\n\n(10)\n\nThis is incorrect for m = 0 because dL/df 6= 0 for m = 0.\nIn that case we ask what fb yields likelihood equal to\nexp(\u22121/2 fmax ). This is approximately 1/2n, which is a reasonable error bar to adopt for the m = 0 case.\nIn our analysis we only use spectroscopically confirmed\ncluster members. Since the redshift sample is BJ selected,\nwithout regard to colour, this should not bias the result,\nespecially given our high completeness (cf. Ellingson et al.\n2001 for a similar approach to data in the CNOC2 survey).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nfb = m/n\n\n(9)\n\nRESULTS\nLuminosity and radial dependence\n\nThe blue fraction depends on the luminosity limit\nand on the aperture used to include members\n(Margoniner & de Carvalho 2000; Ellingson et al. 2001).\nWe analyse these dependencies here, using our sample.\nFig. 2 shows the blue fraction, calculated to M \u2217 + 1.5, vs.\n\n\f5\n\n2dFGRS: Butcher-Oemler effect\n0.4\n\n1\nr30\n\n0.8\n\nr30\nr200/2\nr200\n\nfb\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0.3\n\n-0.2\n1\nr200/2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\nfb\n\nfb\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-0.2\n1\nr200\n\n0.8\n\nfb\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nFigure 2.

Mean values of the blue fraction as a function of\nluminosity and aperture\n\n3.2\nz for all three radii we consider: r30 , r200 and r200 /2 (where\nM \u2217 is taken from De Propris et al. 2003a). This plot shows\nthat there is no dependence of the blue fraction on redshift\nand that therefore our sample of objects is adequate to\nstudy environmental trends in isolation from the effects of\nevolution. Unless otherwise specified, we refer to this blue\nfraction as fb for the remainder of this paper.\nInspection of Fig. 2 shows that there is considerable scatter in the derived blue fraction. This is consistent with previous studies of local and X-ray selected samples (Smail et al. 1998; Margoniner et al. 2001; Goto et al.\n2003a). We compare the distribution of points with a Gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation derived\nfrom a weighted fit to the data. The distribution shows significant skewness and a \u03c72 test yields probabilities below\n10\u22123 that the data points are consistent with a single value\nof fb . This suggests that the scatter observed is a real property of the sample.\nWe plot the mean values of fb as a function of the\nmagnitude limit used for all three apertures in Fig. 3. A\nt\u2212test shows that the distributions have significantly different means: the blue fraction increases as a function of radius\nand as a function of luminosity. This is consistent with previous findings by Margoniner et al. (2001) and Ellingson et al.\n(2001) and implies that the the blue galaxies are intrinsically faint objects and reside preferentially in the cluster\noutskirts.\n\n1\n\nDependence on cluster properties\n\nWe will next consider how the blue fraction depends\non cluster properties derived from our original study\n(De Propris et al. 2002): Bautz-Morgan type, richness, presence of substructure, velocity dispersion and concentration.\nThe Bautz-Morgan type measures the dominance of the\nbrightest cluster galaxy relative to the rest of the cluster\npopulation. It is used as an indicator of dynamical evolution, where the brightest galaxy evolves via the merger of\nM \u2217 galaxies at the cluster center. Velocity dispersion provides a measure of the cluster mass (assuming the clusters\nto be virialized) and of the relative speed of galaxy encounters (which is important for some of the mechanisms for\nthe origin of the Butcher-Oemler effect). Richness, as measured from the number of galaxies brighter than MbJ = \u221219\n(De Propris et al. 2003a), is an indicator of cluster mass\nand mean density. We consider the probability that a cluster contains substructure, using the Lee-Fitchett statistics\n(Fitchett 1988). Although there is no metric to determine\nthe amount of substructure a cluster contains, the probability of its being significantly substructured provides a measure of the amount of recent merging a cluster has undergone and therefore may allow us to estimate how recently\nthe cluster has formed. Finally, we consider the dependence\non cluster concentration, defined as\n\nC = log(r60 /r20 )\n\n(11)\n\n\f6\n\nB-M Type\n\nRoberto De Propris et al.\n3\n\nField\nClusters (r200/2)\n\n0.5\n\n2\n1\n\n0.4\n\nfb\n\n-1\n\n\u03c3r (km s )\n\n1500\n0.3\n\n1000\n500\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n-3.5\n\n20\n\n0\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\nConcentration\n\nP (substructure)\n\nRichness\n\n0.1\n\n40\n-2.5\n\n-2\n-1.5\n-3\nlog \u03c1 (galaxies Mpc )\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\nFigure 5. The blue fraction in the general field as a function of\nlocal density (filled circles) and the mean for all clusters within\nr200 /2 (open square). Density is defined within 8 Mpc spheres as\nin Croton et al. (2004). For clusters we use the number of galaxies\nwithin r200 and assume that all cluster members are within this\nsphere in our calculation of density. Because this is likely to be a\nslight underestimate, we indicate in the figure that this density is\nonly a lower limit.\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nfb\n\nFigure 4. Dependence of the measured blue fraction on cluster\nproperties for the r200 /2 aperture\n\nwhere r20 and r60 are the radii containing 20% and 60% of\nthe cluster population, respectively.\nFig. 4 shows how the blue fraction (to M \u2217 +1.5) depends\non these five variables. We only plot the case corresponding\nto r200 /2 for economy of space, but the results are similar in\nall three apertures. In no case is there any clear evidence of\nany dependence of the blue fraction on Bautz-Morgan type,\nrichness, velocity dispersion, probability of substructure or\nconcentration. This is confirmed by a non-parametric Spearman test, which returns low correlation probabilities in all\ninstances.\n\n3.3\n\n-3\n\nDensity dependence in the field\n\nWe have selected a sample of field galaxies from the 2dFGRS\ngalaxy redshift survey with the same redshift distribution as\nthe clusters. For each galaxy we derived the local density in\nan 8 Mpc sphere (Croton et al. 2004). From this sample we\ndetermine the blue fraction as a function of local density in\nFig. 5.\nThe blue fraction follows a well defined linear trend,\nbecoming higher in low density regions. This trend can be\nextended to clusters, whose behaviour is then simply the\nmore extreme version of the relation between fb and local\ndensity as observed in the general field.\nGalaxies then display a bimodal distribution in colour\nspace, with well-defined red and blue wodges, whose relative\npopulations change with density. This represents a confirma-\n\ntion of the trends observed by the SDSS in their more extensive photometry (Hogg et al. 2003; Blanton et al. 2003b).\nIt is interesting to compare how the relative star formation rates, as measured from H\u03b1 equivalent widths, vary\nwith density or with the only properties that, in clusters,\nappear to affect the blue fraction, luminosity and radius\n(computing absolute star formation rates is difficult with\n2dF data, as the spectra are not easy to flux calibrate, but\nH\u03b1 equivalent widths can be used to provide an estimate of\nthe relative star formation rate within the sample). The H\u03b1\nequivalent widths were computed using Gaussian line fitting\nwith a small (2 \u00c5) correction for underlying line absorption.\nNo dust extinction correction was carried out. A full description of the procedures used can be found in Lewis et al.\n(2002), especially their section 2.4.\nThe variation of H\u03b1 equivalent width with density, luminosity and radius is shown in Fig. 6 and 7. for red and\nblue galaxies in both environments. We see that, while the\nblue fraction changes the mean relative star formation rate\ndoes not. The bimodal behaviour observed in the colours extends to the H\u03b1 equivalent width, as noticed by Balogh et al.\n(2003). The changes in blue fraction and H\u03b1 equivalent\nwidth as a function of density are due to changes in the\nrelative fractions of quiescent and star forming galaxies.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have determined the fraction of blue galaxies in a sample of nearby clusters and in the general field at the same\nredshift. Although the blue fraction varies considerably from\ncluster to cluster, we find that the variation is a real property\nof the sample and not due to statistical noise.\nThe mean value of the blue fraction is 0.11 \u00b1 0.01\nfor galaxies within r30 and 0.13 \u00b1 0.01 for galaxies\nwithin r200 /2. These are higher than the value of 0.03 \u00b1\n0.09 from Margoniner & de Carvalho (2000), \u223c 0.07 from\nMargoniner et al. (2001) and \u223c 0.07 from Pimbblet et al.\n\n\f7\n\n2dFGRS: Butcher-Oemler effect\nMedian H\u03b1 equivalent width (A)\n\n40\nBlue\nRed\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n-3.5\n\n-3\n\n-2.5\n\n-2\n-1.5\n-3\nlog \u03c1 (galaxies Mpc )\n\n-1\n\nblue\n30\n\n20\n\nFigure 6. Median H\u03b1 equivalent widths (in Angstroms) for blue\nand red galaxies in the field as a function of density. Errors are\ninterquartile means. The errors for the red galaxies are smaller\nthan the symbols.\n\n(2002) at z < 0.11, although they are within the errors. One\npossibility for this discrepancy lies in the possibility of blue\ninterlopers from the field population being included in our\nredshift sample (Diaferio et al. 2001). We have calculated\nthe level of contamination by integrating the field luminosity function of Madgwick et al. (2002) over the appropriate\nluminosity range and within the pseudo-volume defined by\nthe aperture used and the range in velocities spanned by\ncluster galaxies. The blue fraction for this sample was calculated from our density-dependent blue fraction. The average level of contamination is 0.08 \u00b1 0.06 but this depends\ncritically on assumptions concerning the mean density of\ngalaxies in cluster outskirts (which influence both the normalization and the fraction of blue interlopers as per Fig. 5).\nIn addition, there are contributions to the error from both\nPoisson and clustering statistics. The number of blue galaxies is, in any case, small and therefore the level of contamination is uncertain and the error in its estimate quite large.\nWe therefore ignore the issue of possible contamination of\nour spectroscopic sample of cluster members.\n\u2022 A first conclusion to be drawn from the derived blue\nfractions is that few clusters have fb > 40% and none has\nfb > 60% .\nSince this sample of clusters is, at least to first order,\ncomplete and volume limited, it represents a fair sampling\nof the range of blue fractions encountered in cluster environments. By contrast, samples of clusters at high redshift\ncontain at least a few objects with blue fractions in excess\nof 40% (Fairley et al. 2002, La Barbera et al. 2003 and\nreferences therein). This would suggest that the observed\nevolution is real: contamination in our sample (if real)\nshould only make the local blue fraction lower, while high\nredshift clusters are drawn from the high richness envelope\nthat contains few local clusters with high fb . However, it\nis possible that optically selected clusters at high redshift\ntend to contain higher fractions of blue galaxies because\nthese make them more conspicuous in blue plates.\n\u2022 The blue fraction appears to depend on the lumi-\n\nr30\nr200/2\nr200\n\n10\n\n-0.5\n\n0\nMedian H\u03b1 equivalent width (A)\n\nMedian H\u03b1 Equivalent Width (Angstrom)\n\n40\n\nred\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n*\nMlim - M\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 7.

(2001).\nThis behaviour is similar to that observed for dwarf\ngalaxies in Coma and Abell 2218: Pracy et al. (2003) have\nshown that dwarfs have a steeper luminosity function at\nlarger cluster centric radii and are preferentially found at\nlarge distances from the cluster core, with these trends\nbeing stronger for the faintest dwarfs. Similar trends\nmay have been observed for galaxies in the Coma cluster\n(Beijersbergen et al. 2002) and appear to persist in the\nz \u223c 0.4 CNOC sample. To the extent that present-day\nclusters and their populations represent proxies for high\nredshift objects, these observations imply that a proportion\nof the blue galaxies are intrinsically low luminosity objects.\n\u2022 There is no dependence of the blue fraction on cluster properties (Fig. 4). The lack of correlation of the blue\nfraction with cluster properties suggests that the star formation rate, or its decrease, is not related to the large scale\nstructure: therefore, mechanisms which involve cluster-wide\neffects, such as ram stripping by the cluster gas, tides, which\ndepend on the cluster mass, or harassment, whose efficiency\nis proportional to velocity dispersion, are disfavoured by the\npresent study, as well as other explanations that depend on\nprocesses specific to the cluster environment. However, as\nBalogh et al. (2003) show, the star formation rate is affected\n\n\f8\n\nRoberto De Propris et al.\n\nby local processes and close interactions are a viable mechanism for the origin of the blue fraction.\nThe above is apparently in contrast with some previous\nstudies: Metevier et al. (2000) claim that clusters containing\nlarge amounts of substructure have higher blue fractions\nand interpret this in terms of a shock model during collisions of subclusters. However, their result is based on three\nclusters and may not be valid for the general population.\nMargoniner et al. (2001) and Goto et al. (2003a) suggest\nthat the blue fraction depends on richness. One possibility\nis that, since they use a fixed 0.7 Mpc aperture, and given\nthe radial dependence observed in Fig. 3, that a spurious\nrichness dependence may be induced by aperture effects.\nWe have derived blue fractions for a 0.7 Mpc aperture in\nour clusters and tested for correlation with richness but\nfailed to detect a significant signal. Similarly, we failed to\ndetect any correlation with richness if we use the same\nluminosity range as Margoniner et al. (2001). However, we\nsee in Fig. 4 that rich clusters tend not to have large blue\nfractions and we also observe that the blue fraction in the\n0.7 Mpc aperture shows large scatter. If the sample used by\nMargoniner et al. (2001) and Goto et al. (2003a) is biased\ntowards richer clusters at high redshift, the combination of\nthese two effects may produce a spurious correlation.\n\u2022 We observe that the blue fraction exhibits a strong dependence with local density in the general field (Fig. 5) and\nthat the cluster value represents a continuation of this trend\nto higher density regimes.\nThis suggests that the same processes are responsible\nfor the Butcher-Oemler effect in all environments and that\nthese mechanisms vary smoothly as a function of density.\nAgain, this implies that cluster-specific processes are not\nlikely causes of changes in the blue fraction, but local\nmechanisms whose efficiency varies smoothly with density,\nsuch as interactions (Lavery & Henry 1988; Couch et al.\n1998), may be viable explanations.\n\u2022 The relative star formation rate for the blue galaxies\ndoes not appear to decrease as a function of density (Fig. 6)\nor as a function of luminosity or radius in clusters (Fig. 7).\nThis implies that changes in the blue fraction are solely\ndue to changes in the relative fractions of red (quiescent)\nand blue (star-forming) galaxies. The trends we observe\ncan be roughly reproduced by using the density-dependent\nluminosity functions of Croton et al. (2004) for early- and\nlate-type galaxies and the type-dependent cluster luminosity functions of De Propris et al. (2003a) and simply\nassuming that early-type galaxies are red and late types\nare blue. This suggests that the simple model presented\nin De Propris et al. (2003a), where galaxies simply moved\nbetween spectral types without number or luminosity\nevolution, provides, heuristically, a good representation of\ngalaxy evolution.\nOne possible caveat is that, by selecting blue galaxies,\nwe have automatically selected for galaxies with H\u03b1 emission, while morphologically selected samples show declining\nstar formation rates as a function of density (Gomez et al.\n2003; Goto et al. 2003b). However, the observation that blue\ncluster galaxies have the same H\u03b1 equivalent width as their\ncounterparts in the field is non-trivial, because lower (but\n\nnon-zero) star formation rates will lead to weaker H\u03b1 emission, while the colour would remain blue by our definition.\nThis is in contrast, for instance, with models where galaxies\nare 'choked' in clusters (Balogh et al. 2000).\nThe above argues for a model where star formation\ndeclines over relatively short timescales, leading to the bimodal distribution in H\u03b1 observed by Balogh et al. (2003),\nand galaxy colours evolve quickly to the red envelope,\nproducing the colour bimodality observed here and in\nthe SDSS (Hogg et al. 2003; Blanton et al. 2003b). As in\nDe Propris et al. (2003a) this is possible if the optical colour\nis dominated by the young population but the majority of\nlight is provided by the underlying old stars, so that once\nthe star formation is extinguished galaxy colours quickly\nevolve on to the passive locus. Shioya et al. (2002) have\nshown that truncating the star formation of spiral galaxies\nin the field leads them on to the colour-magnitude relation\ndefined by the Coma E/S0 galaxies, but that this process is\ninefficient for the more massive galaxies and is viable only\nfor low mass spirals. When we consider the radial and luminosity trends, one possible interpretation is that a large\nfraction of the blue galaxies are actually dwarfs undergoing\nepisodes of star formation, as also suggested by a number of\nother lines of evidence (Rakos et al. 1997; Couch et al. 1998;\nDe Propris et al. 2003b). However, we caution the reader\nthat since our sample of cluster and field galaxies is local,\nwe cannot properly discuss the origin of the blue fraction at\nhigher redshift.\nA complication in interpreting these data is that the\nobserved correlations of fb and H\u03b1 with density on large\nscales imply that the environment today is not affecting the\nproperties of the population and therefore we are unable\nto observe galaxy evolution in progress but just its end result. This implies that identifying the mechanisms responsible for the Butcher-Oemler effect in the local universe is\nproblematic. Surveys at intermediate redshifts (e.g. DEEP2,\nVIMOS) may be able to witness the main phases of galaxy\nevolution.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are indebted to the staff at the Anglo-Australian Observatory for their tireless effort and assistance in supporting\n2dF during the course of the survey.
