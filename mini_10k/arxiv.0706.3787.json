We find explicit conditions on the initial data,\nwith ADM mass M, such that the resulting spacetime has the following\nproperties: there is a family of radially outgoing null geodesics where\nthe area radius r along each geodesic is bounded by 2M, the timelike lines r = c \u2208 [0, 2M ] are incomplete, and for r > 2M the metric\nconverges asymptotically to the Schwarzschild metric with mass M .\nThe initial data that we construct guarantee the formation of a black\nhole in the evolution. We also give examples of such initial data with\nthe additional property that the solutions exist for all r \u2265 0 and all\nSchwarzschild time, i.e., we obtain global existence in Schwarzschild\ncoordinates in situations where the initial data are not small. Some\n\n1\n\n\fof our results are also established for the Einstein equations coupled\nto a general matter model characterized by conditions on the matter\nquantities.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the many striking predictions of General Relativity is the assertion\nthat under appropriate conditions astrophysical objects like stars or galaxies\nundergo a gravitational collapse resulting in a spacetime singularity. This\nwas first proven by Oppenheimer and Snyder [19] who constructed a semiexplicit example of a homogeneous spherically symmetric ball of dust, i.e.,\nof a pressure-less fluid, which under its self-consistent, general relativistic\ngravitational interaction collapses. During this collapse the scalar curvature\nof spacetime blows up at the centre of symmetry, and the geometry of spacetime breaks down there. This is referred to as the formation of a spacetime\nsingularity. An important feature of the Oppenheimer-Snyder solution is\nthat during the collapse a two-dimensional spacelike sphere evolves which\nencloses the singularity and through which no causal curve, i.e., no light\nray or particle trajectory, can pass outward. In this way the spacetime singularity is isolated from the outside part of spacetime by a so-called event\nhorizon, and the singularity cannot be seen or in any other way be experienced by observers outside the event horizon. This configuration was later\ntermed a black hole.\nIn the 1960s Penrose [20] proved that the formation of spacetime singularities from regular initial data is not restricted to spherically symmetric,\nespecially constructed or isolated examples but is a genuine, stable feature\nof spacetimes. However, this result gives little information about the geometric structure of a spacetime with such a singularity. In particular, it is\nin general not known if every spacetime singularity which arises from the\ngravitational collapse of regular initial data is covered by an event horizon.\nSince the existence of so-called naked singularities (for which, by definition,\nthe latter is not true) would violate predictability (it would not be possible\nto predict from the initial data what an observer would see if he could observe a singularity), the cosmic censorship conjecture was formulated which\ndemands that any singularity which arises from the gravitational collapse of\ngeneric regular initial data is indeed hidden behind an event horizon. The\nrestriction to generic data means that naked singularities are allowed to occur for a \"null set\" of the initial data. An important example where naked\nsingularities do form for a null set, but for which cosmic censorship holds\n\n2\n\n\ftrue, is the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field system, cf. [10, 11].\nActually the above is an informal statement of the so-called weak cosmic\ncensorship conjecture [34, 12.1]; we will not be concerned with the strong\nversion in the present paper. For a mathematical discussion and the definition of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture we refer to [12].\nTo deal with this conjecture in full generality is out of reach of the\npresent level of mathematics, but under the assumption of spherical symmetry progress has been made in recent years. One important outcome of\nthese investigations is that the answer is sensitive to which model is chosen\nto describe the matter. Christodoulou [7] showed that for dust, i.e., the\nmatter model used by Oppenheimer and Snyder, cosmic censorship is violated. On the other hand, in a series of papers Christodoulou investigated\na massless scalar field as matter model and showed in 1999 that weak and\nstrong cosmic censorship hold true for this matter model; see [11] and the\nreferences therein.\nIn the present investigation the main example considered as a matter\nmodel is the so-called collisionless gas as described by the Vlasov equation.\nIt is used extensively in astrophysics, cf. [6], to describe galaxies or globular\nclusters which are viewed as large ensembles of mass points which interact\nonly through the gravitational field that the ensemble creates collectively.\nIn a relativistic context this leads to the Einstein-Vlasov system. All results\navailable for this system support the following\nConjecture: Weak cosmic censorship holds for the Einstein-Vlasov system.\nWe mention explicitly that, in contrast to dust, small, spherically symmetric initial data launch global solutions, i.e., the solutions are geodesically\ncomplete and hence satisfy cosmic censorship, cf. [25]. Also, the numerical\nsimulations [5, 18, 29] which treat large initial data support the hypothesis\nthat naked singularities do not form in the evolution. We point out a further\ninteresting feature of Vlasov matter observed in these numerical studies: In\na one-parameter family of solutions which for large parameters, i.e., large\namplitudes of the initial data, collapse to a black hole the smallest black hole\nalways has a strictly positive ADM mass, i.e., there is a mass gap. For some\nother models, e.g. a scalar field, the mass of the black hole as a function of\nthe parameter is continuous and arbitrarily small black holes can form, cf.\n[15] for a review.\nThe aim of the present paper is to find explicit conditions on the initial\ndata which ensure the formation of black holes. This class of initial data\nhas the important property that, except for \"boundary cases\", properly restricted small perturbations of the data lead to solutions with the same\n3\n\n\fproperties. In this sense the established behaviour of the solutions is stable\nand not restricted to especially constructed solutions or initial data, respectively. It turns out that some of our results can be formulated for a general\nmatter model which satisfies certain specific assumptions, and in order to\ngive a broader impact to our results we shall do so. At the same time we\nemphasize that the Vlasov matter model is the only one which is presently\nknown to actually satisfy all the assumptions needed for our arguments to\ngo through.\nAs an interesting corallary to our main result we show that it is in fact\npossible to choose initial data for the Einstein-Vlasov system, which lead to\nformation of black holes, such that the solutions exist for all Schwarzschild\ntime and all r \u2265 0. We thus obtain global existence in Schwarzschild coordinates for initial data which are not small, and to the best of our knowledge\nthis is the first global existence result in Schwarzschild coordinates for initial\ndata which lead to gravitational collapse and formation of black holes.\nOne aspect of our result is that there is a set of initial data which leads\nto gravitational collapse such that weak cosmic censorship holds. This point\nshould be related to an earlier result by Rendall [32], where it is shown that\nthere exist initial data for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov system\nsuch that a trapped surface forms in the evolution. The occurrence of a\ntrapped surface signals the formation of an event horizon. Indeed, Dafermos\n[13] has proved that if a spherically symmetric spacetime contains a trapped\nsurface and the matter model satisfies certain hypotheses then weak cosmic\ncensorship holds true. In [14] it was then shown that Vlasov matter does\nsatisfy the required hypotheses. Hence, by combining these results it follows\nthat initial data exist which lead to gravitational collapse and for which weak\ncosmic censorship holds. However, the proof in [32] rests on a continuity\nargument, and it is not possible to tell whether or not a given initial data\nset will give rise to a black hole. This is in contrast to the explicit conditions\non the initial data, together with the detailed asymptotic structure, that we\nobtain in the present work. In this regard it is natural to relate our results\nto those of Christodoulou on the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field\nsystem [8] and [9]. In [8] it is shown that if the final Bondi mass M is\ndifferent from zero, the region exterior to the sphere r = 2M tends to the\nSchwarzschild metric with mass M . In Theorem 2.4 below we show that\nsolutions of the spherically Einstein-Vlasov system, under certain conditions\non the initial data, also converge to the Schwarzschild metric asymptotically.\nFurthermore, in [9] explicit conditions on the initial data are specified which\nguarantee the formation of trapped surfaces. This paper played a crucial\nrole in Christodoulou's proof [11] of the weak and strong cosmic censorship\n4\n\n\fconjectures mentioned above. The conditions on the initial data in [9] allow\nthe ratio of the Hawking mass and the area radius to cover the full range,\ni.e., 2m/r \u2208 (0, 1), whereas our conditions always require 2m/r to be quite\nclose to one. However, we believe that to understand gravitational collapse\nin the case of Vlasov matter the essential situation is when 2m/r is large.\nWe thus hope that the results in the present paper will lead to progress\non the general understanding of gravitational collapse and the weak cosmic\ncensorship conjecture in the case of Vlasov matter.\nThe Vlasov matter model has a further property to recommend it when\ncompared to other matter models. For the Vlasov-Poisson system, which\narises as the Newtonian limit of the Einstein-Vlasov system in a rigorous\nsense [26, 31], and which is used extensively in astrophysics, there is a global\nexistence and uniqueness result for general, smooth initial data [17, 21]. This\nmeans in particular that any breakdown of a solution of the Einstein-Vlasov\nsystem can be expected to be a genuine, general relativistic effect such as a\nspacetime singularity and not only remainder of some bad behaviour which\nthe matter model exhibits already on the Newtonian level.\nTo be more specific, consider now a smooth spacetime manifold M\nequipped with a spacetime metric g\u03b1\u03b2 ; Greek indices run from 0 to 3. Then\nthe Einstein equations read\nG\u03b1\u03b2 = 8\u03c0T\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere G\u03b1\u03b2 is the Einstein tensor, a non-linear second order differential expression in the metric g\u03b1\u03b2 , and T\u03b1\u03b2 is the energy-momentum tensor given\nby the matter content (or other fields) of the spacetime. To obtain a closed\nsystem, the field equations (1.1) have to be supplemented by\nevolution equation(s) for the matter\n\n(1.2)\n\nand\nthe definition of T\u03b1\u03b2 in terms of the matter and the metric.\n\n(1.3)\n\nIt is often possible to specify conditions on (1.2) and (1.3) under which one\ncan establish geometric properties of a spacetime described by the Einsteinmatter system (1.1), (1.2), (1.3). The Penrose singularity theorem mentioned above is of this nature, and part of our arguments will also be presented in this form.\nHowever, in order to verify such general conditions, in particular with\nrespect to the existence of local or global solutions to the corresponding\n5\n\n\finitial value problem, a specific matter model must be chosen, and in the\npresent paper this is a collisionless gas. All the particles in the gas are\nassumed to have the same rest mass, normalized to unity, and to move\nforward in time. Hence, their number density f is a non-negative function\nsupported on the mass shell\nn\no\nP M := g\u03b1\u03b2 p\u03b1 p\u03b2 = \u22121, p0 > 0 ,\n\na submanifold of the tangent bundle T M of the spacetime manifold M ; p\u03b1\nare the canonical momenta corresponding to general coordinates x\u03b1 = (t, xa )\non M . We use coordinates (t, xa ) with zero shift, and Latin indices run from\n1 to 3. On the mass shell P M the variable p0 becomes a function of the\nremaining variables (t, xa , pb ):\np\np\np0 = \u2212g 00 1 + gab pa pb .\nThe number density f = f (t, xa , pb ) satisfies a continuity equation, the socalled Vlasov equation, which says that f is constant along the geodesics of\nthe spacetime metric,\n\u2202t f +\n\n1\npa\n\u2202xa f \u2212 0 \u0393a\u03b2\u03b3 p\u03b2 p\u03b3 \u2202pa f = 0,\n0\np\np\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 are the Christoffel symbols induced by the metric g\u03b1\u03b2 . The\nenergy-momentum tensor is given by\nZ\ndp1 dp2 dp3\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = p\u03b1 p\u03b2 f |g|1/2\n,\n(1.5)\n\u2212p0\nwhere |g| denotes the modulus of the determinant of the metric. The system\n(1.1), (1.4), (1.5) is the Einstein-Vlasov system in general coordinates. For\nan introduction to relativistic kinetic theory and the Einstein-Vlasov system\nwe refer to [1] and [33].\nIf, for comparison, the matter is to be described as a perfect fluid with\ndensity R, four-velocity field U \u03b1 , and pressure P , then the matter evolution\nequations are the Euler equations\nU \u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 R + (R + P )\u2207\u03b1 U\u03b1 = 0,\n(R + P )U \u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 U\u03b2 + (g\u03b1\u03b2 + U\u03b1 U\u03b2 )\u2207\u03b1 P = 0,\nwhere \u2207\u03b1 is the covariant derivative corresponding to the metric g\u03b1\u03b2 . The\nenergy-momentum tensor in this case is\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = RU\u03b1 U\u03b2 + P (g\u03b1\u03b2 + U\u03b1 U\u03b2 ).\n6\n\n\fTo close the Einstein-Euler system it has to be supplemented by an equation\nof state P = P (R). The choice P = 0 yields the dust matter model referred\nto above.\nDue to the complexity of the field equations (1.1) very little can be\nsaid about the questions at hand for these equations in their general form.\nSince on the other hand these questions are of considerable interest also\nin spacetimes satisfying simplifying symmetry assumptions, we from now\non focus on asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric spacetimes and write\ndown the metric\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03bc(t,r) dt2 + e2\u03bb(t,r) dr 2 + r 2 (d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 )\nin Schwarzschild coordinates. Here t \u2208 R is the time coordinate, r \u2208 [0, \u221e[\nis the area radius, i.e., 4\u03c0r 2 is the area of the orbit of the symmetry group\nSO(3) labeled by r, and the angles \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] and \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] parameterize\nthese orbits. Asymptotic flatness means that the metric quantities \u03bb and \u03bc\nhave to satisfy the boundary conditions\nlim \u03bb(t, r) = lim \u03bc(t, r) = 0.\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n(1.6)\n\nFor a metric of this form the 00, 11, and 01 components of the Einstein\nequations are found to be\ne\u22122\u03bb (2r\u03bbr \u2212 1) + 1 = 8\u03c0r 2 e\u22122\u03bc T00 ,\n\n(1.7)\n\ne\u22122\u03bb (2r\u03bcr + 1) \u2212 1 = 8\u03c0r 2 e\u22122\u03bb T11 ,\n\n(1.8)\n\n\u03bbt = 4\u03c0rT01 ,\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhere subscripts indicate partial derivatives. The 22 and 33 components are\nalso nontrivial, but they are not needed for our analysis, and the remaining\ncomponents vanish identically due to the symmetry assumption.\nOur aim is to find explicit conditions on the initial data such that the\ncorresponding solutions of the spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat\nversion of the system (1.1), (1.2), (1.3) have the following property: There\nis an outgoing radial null geodesic \u03b3 + originating from r = r0 > 0, i.e.,\nd\u03b3 +\n+\n(s) = e(\u03bc\u2212\u03bb)(s,\u03b3 (s)) , \u03b3 + (0) = r0 ,\nds\n\n(1.10)\n\nsuch that the solution exists on the outer region\nD := {(t, r) \u2208 [0, \u221e[2 | r \u2265 \u03b3 + (t)},\n7\n\n(1.11)\n\n\fand \u03b3 + has the property that\nlim \u03b3 + (s) < \u221e.\n\ns\u2192\u221e\n\n(1.12)\n\nThis indicates that the matter distribution undergoes a gravitational collapse, and a black hole forms. In the case of Vlasov matter we obtain a\nmore detailed picture which supports this interpretation: There exists an\nextremal, radially outgoing null geodesic \u03b3 \u2217 in the outer domain D such\nthat lims\u2192\u221e \u03b3 \u2217 (s) = 2M where M is the ADM mass of the solution, and\nas t \u2192 \u221e the metric converges for r > 2M to the Schwarzschild metric\nrepresenting a black hole of mass M .\nIn the next section we state our main results for the Einstein-Vlasov\nsystem, where we specify classes of spherically symmetric initial data which\nlead to solutions showing the above behaviour. The Vlasov equation and the\ncorresponding energy-momentum tensor components in the case of spherical\nsymmetry are stated there. In Section 3 we give a general formulation of\none of our results where no particular matter model is considered. The\nreason for this is that most steps in the proof of Theorem 2.2 below are of a\ngeneral character and-besides the fact that for the Einstein-Vlasov system\nthere is an existence theory for the initial value problem which guarantees\nthe existence of solutions on D-the specific properties of Vlasov matter are\nused only in one key lemma. Hence it is natural to precisely single out the\nrequired conditions on the level of the macroscopic matter quantities. This\nclarifies the main mechanism in our method, and it may lead to applications\nof our method to other matter models. Using an additional feature of Vlasov\nmatter we construct an alternative, and in some respects larger, class of\ninitial data which ensure the formation of black holes, cf. Theorem 2.1.\nThe proofs of our results then proceed as follows. After stating some\ngeneral auxiliary results in Section 4 we prove Theorem 3.1, which is the\ngeneral-matter version of Theorem 2.2, in Section 5. The latter result is\nthen established in Section 6 by showing that Vlasov matter satisfies the\nrequired general conditions on the matter for a suitable class of initial data.\nTheorem 2.1 is established in Section 7 together with Corallary 2.3 on global\nexistence in Schwarzschild coordinates. For all these results it is essential to\nmake sure that in the outer region D all the matter moves inward. In the\ncase of general matter this is a condition which we have to impose on the\nsolution, whereas in the case of Vlasov matter we can specify conditions on\nthe initial data such that this is true. In Section 8 we prove the convergence\nof our solution to a Schwarzschild black hole of the corresponding ADM\nmass in the case of Vlasov matter.\n8\n\n\f2\n\nMain results for Vlasov matter\n\nIn this section Eqns. (1.6)\u2013(1.9) will be supplemented by the spherically\nsymmetric version of the Vlasov equation together with expressions for the\nrelevant components of the energy-momentum tensor so that a closed system is obtained, known as the spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat\nEinstein-Vlasov system.\nIn order to exploit the symmetry it is useful to introduce non-canonical\nvariables on momentum space and write f = f (t, r, w, L). For a detailed\nderivation of the corresponding equations we refer to [24]; here we just state\nthe result. The Vlasov equation is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc\u2212\u03bb w\n\u03bc\u2212\u03bb\n\u03bc\u2212\u03bb L\n\u2202t f + e\n\u2202r f \u2212 \u03bbt w + e\n\u03bcr E \u2212 e\n\u2202w f = 0,\n(2.1)\nE\nr3E\nwhere\nE = E(r, w, L) :=\n\np\n\n1 + w2 + L/r 2 = e\u03bc p0 .\n\nThe variables w \u2208] \u2212 \u221e, \u221e[ and L \u2208 [0, \u221e[ can be thought of as the radial\ncomponent of the momentum and the square of the angular momentum\nrespectively. Notice that the latter is conserved along characteristics of the\nVlasov equation. The matter quantities are given by\nZ\nZ\n\u03c0 \u221e \u221e\n\u22122\u03bc\nEf (t, r, w, L) dL dw,\n(2.2)\n\u03c1(t, r) = e\nT00 (t, r) = 2\nr \u2212\u221e 0\nZ\nZ\n\u03c0 \u221e \u221e w2\n\u22122\u03bb\nf (t, r, w, L) dL dw,\n(2.3)\np(t, r) = e T11 (t, r) = 2\nr \u2212\u221e 0 E\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\n\u03c0\nj(t, r) = \u2212e\u2212(\u03bb+\u03bc) T01 (t, r) = 2\nw f (t, r, w, L) dL dw. (2.4)\nr \u2212\u221e 0\nNotice that the quantities \u03c1, p, j appear on the right hand sides of the\nfield equations (1.7)\u2013(1.9), and they are given in terms of f alone, which\nis the main reason for using the non-canonical variables w and L. The\nsystem (1.6)\u2013(1.9), (2.1)\u2013(2.4) is the spherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov\nsystem in Schwarzschild coordinates.\nAs initial data we need to prescribe an\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\ninitial distribution function f = f(r, w, L) \u2265 0, which should be compactly\nsupported in ]0, \u221e[\u00d7] \u2212 \u221e, \u221e[\u00d7]0, \u221e[, and such that\nZ r\nZ rZ \u221e Z \u221e\n\u25e6\nr\n\u25e6\n(2.5)\n4\u03c0\u03b7 2 \u03c1(\u03b7) d\u03b7 = 4\u03c0 2\nE f(\u03b7, w, L) dL dw d\u03b7 < .\n2\n0\n0\n\u2212\u221e 0\nThe origin r = 0 is excluded from the support for technical reasons, but this\ncould be avoided by using Cartesian coordinates. The condition (2.5) implies\n9\n\n\fthat the equations (1.7) and (1.8) have solutions \u03bb and \u03bc, cf. Section 4, and\n\u25e6\nsince f has compact support, a property which is inherited by f (t), the\n\u25e6\nmatter terms are well defined. If in addition f is C 1 we say that the initial\ndata is regular. As is shown in [25] or [24], regular initial data launch a unique\nlocal solution for which all the derivatives which appear in the system exist\nclassically. In Section 6 we discuss in more detail that this local solution\nextends to the whole outer region D defined in (1.11).\nTo state our main results let 0 < r0 < r1 be given, put M = r1 /2 (this\nis going to be the ADM mass of the solution), and fix 0 < Mout < M such\nthat\n2(M \u2212 Mout )\n8\n< .\n(2.6)\nr0\n9\nRemark. The value 8/9 is chosen for definiteness, and any number less\nthan one would do, effecting the values of some of the constants below.\nTwo different theorems will be stated below, corresponding to the following two situations.\n(i) Let R1 > r1 be such that\nR1 \u2212 r 1 <\n\nr1 \u2212 r0\n,\n6\n\n(2.7)\n\nor\n(ii) let R1 > r1 be such that\nr\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\nr02\nr1 \u2212 r0\nR1 \u2212 r1\n< min\n,\n,\n,\nR1\n6 12\u03baR1 M 8\u03baR1\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere the (explicit) constant \u03ba > 0 will be specified in Theorems 2.2\nand 3.1 below.\nFinally, we define\n\n1\n(r1 + R1 ).\n2\n\u25e6\nDenote\nby \u03c1 the energy density induced by the initial distribution function\n\u25e6\nf. We require that all the matter in the outer region [r0 , \u221e[ is initially\nlocated in the strip [R0 , R1 ], with Mout being the corresponding fraction of\nthe ADM mass M , i.e.,\nZ \u221e\nZ R1\n\u25e6\n2\u25e6\n(2.9)\n4\u03c0r 2 \u03c1(r)dr = Mout .\n4\u03c0r \u03c1(r)dr =\nR0 :=\n\nr0\n\nR0\n\n10\n\n\fFurthermore, the remaining fraction M \u2212 Mout should be initially located\nwithin the ball of area radius r0 , i.e.,\nZ r0\n\u25e6\n4\u03c0r 2 \u03c1(r)dr = M \u2212 Mout .\n(2.10)\n0\n\nRemark. The set up described above is quite similar to the set up in [9]\nfor a scalar field. In [9] it is not required to have matter in an \"inner\" strip\n[0, r0 ], as is the case here in view of (2.10) and the condition Mout < M.\nThe reason why we need some matter in the region r \u2264 r0 is to ensure that\ninitially ingoing matter continues to be ingoing for all times, cf. Lemma 6.1\nbelow. If one only considers purely radially ingoing particles, i.e., with no\nangular momentum (which results in a non-smooth distribution function f ),\nthen we could allow for Mout = M. It is interesting to note that p = \u03c1 holds\nfor Vlasov matter, if the particles have no angular momentum and their rest\nmass is zero, which is the case for the scalar field considered in [9].\nNow we are in the position to formulate our main results for Vlasov\nmatter. Corresponding to Case (i) above, we prove\nTheorem 2.1 Let r0 , r1 , M , and Mout be given as above, and let R1 satisfy\n(2.7). Then there exists a set I1 of regular initial data for the spherically\n\u25e6\nsymmetric Einstein-Vlasov system such that if f \u2208 I1 , then (2.9) and (2.10)\nhold, the corresponding solution exists on D, and\nZ \u221e\n+\n4\u03c0r 2 \u03c1(s, r) dr > 0,\nlim \u03b3 (s) < \u221e, lim\ns\u2192\u221e\n\ns\u2192\u221e \u03b3 + (s)\n\nwhere \u03b3 + satisfies (1.10).\nBy abuse of notation we denote by D both the outer region in spacetime\ndefined by (1.11) and the part of the mass shell with (t, r) \u2208 D.\nThe next theorem addresses Case (ii) above, assuming the stronger condition (2.8). This allows for a more straightforward proof, and the constraints\n\u25e6\non the momentum variables of the initial distribution function f which are\nused to specify the set I1 will be slightly relaxed. Hence, the initial data set\nI1 does not contain I2 in Theorem 2.2 below, but it is larger in the sense\nthat data in I2 are quite close to containing a trapped surface, which is not\nnecessarily the case for data in I1 . The precise form of I1 and I2 is specified\nin the proofs.\nTheorem 2.2 Let r0 , r1 , M , and Mout be given as above and let R1 satisfy\n(2.8) with \u03ba = 6. Then there exists a set I2 of regular initial data for the\n11\n\n\f\u25e6\n\nspherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov system such that if f \u2208 I2 , then (2.9)\nand (2.10) hold, the corresponding solution exists on D, and\nZ \u221e\n+\n4\u03c0r 2 \u03c1(s, r) dr > 0,\nlim \u03b3 (s) < \u221e, lim\ns\u2192\u221e\n\ns\u2192\u221e \u03b3 + (s)\n\nwhere \u03b3 + satisfies (1.10).\nThe Einstein-Vlasov system has a wide variety of static, spherically symmetric solutions with finite ADM mass and finite radius, i.e., compact support\nof the matter, cf. [23, 27, 30]. Particularly interesting examples of initial\ndata for which our results apply are obtained if the matter for r \u2264 r0 is\nrepresented by such a static solution, more precisely:\nCorollary 2.3 Let fs be a static solution of the spherically symmetric\nEinstein-Vlasov system with finite ADM mass Ms > 0 and finite radius\nrs > 0. Define r0 = rs , let r1 > r0 be arbitrary, M = r1 /2, and\nMout = M \u2212 Ms ; the latter quantity\nis positive. Then the initial data sets\n\u25e6\nI1 and I2 both contain data f which coincide with the given static solution\nfor 0 \u2264 r \u2264 r0 . The corresponding solution f of the Einstein-Vlasov system\nexists for all r \u2265 0, t \u2265 0 and coincides with the static solution fs for all\nr \u2264 \u03b3 + (t) and t \u2265 0.\nWe prove this result at the end of Section 7. It represents a global\nexistence result for the Einstein-Vlasov system in Schwarzschild time for\ndata which are not small.\nIn the next section we formulate a version of Theorem 2.2 for quite general matter models. One reason for this is that the main mechanism behind\nour method becomes very transparent by posing sufficient conditions on the\nmacroscopic\nmatter terms rather than conditions on the initial distribution\n\u25e6\nfunction f as we did in the theorems above. Theorem 2.2 will then be a\nconsequence of this generalization, cf. Section 6, whereas Theorem 2.1 is\nestablished in Section 7.\nIn these proofs it turns out that for the classes of initial data that we\nspecify we can obtain somewhat sharper asymptotic information on \u03b3 + and\nthe mass in the outer region; see (5.8) below. More importantly, we can\nestablish the following additional information which shows that the solution\nevolves towards a Schwarzschild black hole of mass M .\nTheorem 2.4 In the situation of Theorem 2.1 or Theorem 2.2 the following\nholds:\n12\n\n\f(a) There exist constants \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0 depending only on the initial data set\nI1 or I2 respectively such that if\nt \u2265 0 and r \u2265 2M + \u03b1e\u2212\u03b2t\nthen f (t, r, *, *) = 0, i.e., we have vacuum, and the metric equals the\nSchwarzschild metric\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2M\n2M \u22121 2\n2\n2\nds = \u2212 1 \u2212\ndr + r 2 (d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ),\ndt + 1 \u2212\nr\nr\nrepresenting a black hole of mass M .\n(b) For all t \u2265 0 and \u03b3 + (t) \u2264 r \u2264 2M + \u03b1e\u2212\u03b2t ,\n\u03bc(t, r) \u2264 ln\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1e\u2212\u03b2t\n2M + \u03b1e\u2212\u03b2t\n\n\u00131/2\n\nso that in the outer region D,\nlim \u03bc(t, r) = \u2212\u221e for r \u2264 2M,\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nand the timelike lines r = c, where c \u2208 [0, 2M ], are incomplete and\ntheir proper lengths are uniformly bounded by a constant depending on\n\u03b1, \u03b2 and M.\n(c) Let\nr \u2217 := sup{r \u2265 r0 | the radially outgoing null geodesic \u03b3 with\n\u03b3(0) = r satisfies lim \u03b3(s) < \u221e},\ns\u2192\u221e\n\nand let \u03b3 \u2217 be the radially outgoing null geodesic with \u03b3 \u2217 (0) = r \u2217 . Then\nlim \u03b3 \u2217 (s) = 2M,\n\ns\u2192\u221e\n\nand every radially outgoing null geodesic \u03b3 with \u03b3(0) > r \u2217 is future\ncomplete with lims\u2192\u221e \u03b3(s) = \u221e.\n\n3\n\nThe result for general matter models\n\nIn this section we specify the general assumptions on a matter model sufficient for our method to be applied. In order to keep the discussion consistent\n13\n\n\fwith the Vlasov part of our arguments, and in view of the right hand sides\nof the field equations (1.7), (1.8), (1.9), it is convenient to use the notation\n\u03c1 := e\u22122\u03bc T00 , p := e\u22122\u03bb T11 , j := \u2212e\u2212\u03bc\u2212\u03bb T01 .\n\n(3.1)\n\nFirstly, we assume that the following two conditions are satisfied.\n\u2022 The dominant energy condition holds.\n\n(DEC)\n\n\u2022 The radial pressure p is non-negative.\n\n(NNP)\n\nThe dominant energy condition (DEC) plays a central role in general relativity and is the main criterion that a matter model should satisfy to be\nconsidered realistic. We refer to [16] for its definition. The non-negative\npressure condition (NNP) is restrictive in the sense that it rules out, for\nexample, a Maxwell field as matter model. However, for most astrophysical models it is a standard assumption, with e.g. fluid models satisfying\nthis condition. For the purpose of this paper we only need to focus on two\nconsequences of these two criteria, cf. [16] and [22]. The (DEC) condition\nimplies, together with the (NNP) condition, that\n0 \u2264 p \u2264 \u03c1 and |j| \u2264 \u03c1.\n\n(3.2)\n\nFurthermore, by (DEC) any geodesic (s, R(s)) of a material particle or a\nlight ray satisfies\ndR(s)\n\u2264 e(\u03bc\u2212\u03bb)(s,R(s)) .\n(3.3)\nds\nThe meaning of the latter condition is that locally the speed of energy flow\nis less than or equal to the speed of light.\nLet \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03c1, p, j correspond to a solution of the spherically symmetric\nEinstein-matter equations (1.6)\u2013(1.9), (1.2), (1.3) in Schwarzschild coordinates, launched by initial data from a class I. In order to investigate the\nglobal structure of the solutions it is necessary that they exist globally in\nan appropriate sense. In the situation at hand they need to exist on the\nouter region D defined in (1.11). In the spherical symmetric case the main\nobstruction for obtaining global solutions arises from the difficulties related\nto the centre of symmetry r = 0. For example, for a massless scalar field or\na collisionless gas as matter model it has been shown that solutions remain\nregular away from r = 0 for general initial data, cf. [12, 2, 28]. On the\nother hand, for dust a singularity of shell crossing type can also occur at\nsome r > 0. Although in that case there are no true geometric spacetime\nsingularities, such behaviour has to be ruled out in order not to interfere\n14\n\n\fwith the analysis of the solution on D. This can be achieved by proper assumptions on the initial data, cf. [7]. In view of (3.3) a possible break down\nof solutions at r = 0 will have no influence on the outer domain D. Hence\nwe formulate a third condition, concerning global existence of solutions in\nthe outer domain, as follows.\n\u2022 For solutions launched by data from the set I, \u03b3 + defined by (1.10)\nexists on [0, \u221e[, and \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03c1, p, j \u2208 C 1 (D).\n(GLO)\nThe three conditions above are of a quite general nature. The fourth and\nfinal condition however, is tightly connected to our method of proof.\n\u2022 There exists a constant c1 > 0 such that \u03c1 \u2264 \u2212c1 j in D.\n\n(GCC)\n\nThe acronym (GCC) stands for \"gravitational collapse condition\", and this\ncondition plays a crucial role for our method of proof. We emphasize that\nour main results show that for Vlasov matter there are initial data sets such\nthat (GCC) holds. As a first consequence of (GCC) and (3.2), note that\nj \u2264 0 in D, i.e., the matter is ingoing for all times. In this respect our\npresent results complement [4], where purely outgoing matter is considered.\nLet us now assume that our matter model satisfies (DEC) and (NNP),\nand that there exists an initial data set I such that (GLO) and (GCC) hold\nas well. Then we have the following result, which should be viewed as a\nversion of Theorem 2.2 for general matter.\nTheorem 3.1 Let r0 , r1 , M , and Mout be given as above and let R1 satisfy\n(2.8) with \u03ba = 2c1 . Assume that there exists an initial data set I3 \u2282 I such\nthat (2.9) and (2.10) hold for all initial data in I3 . Then for any solution\nlaunched by initial data in I3 ,\nZ \u221e\n4\u03c0r 2 \u03c1(s, r) dr > 0,\nlim \u03b3 + (s) < \u221e, lim\ns\u2192\u221e\n\ns\u2192\u221e \u03b3 + (s)\n\nwhere \u03b3 + satisfies (1.10).\nThe detailed information on the gravitational collapse which for Vlasov matter is provided in Theorem 2.4 is not available in the present situation, but\nthe following still holds.\nRemark. In the situation of Theorem 3.1,\nlim \u03bc(t, r) = \u2212\u221e for lim \u03b3 + (s) \u2264 r \u2264 r1\ns\u2192\u221e\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n15\n\n\ffor some r1 > lims\u2192\u221e \u03b3 + (s). If r \u2217 and \u03b3 \u2217 are defined as in Theorem 2.4\nthen\nlim \u03b3 \u2217 (s) < \u221e,\ns\u2192\u221e\n\nand every radially outgoing null geodesic \u03b3 with \u03b3(0) > r \u2217 is future complete\nwith lims\u2192\u221e \u03b3(s) = \u221e.\nThese assertions will be established in Section 8. Concerning the question which matter models besides Vlasov matter satisfy our conditions above\nwe note the following:\nRemark. For a spherically symmetric perfect fluid with density R, pressure\nP = P (R), and radial velocity field u, the (DEC) and (NNP) conditions and\nEqn. (3.2) respectively are satisfied provided that 0 \u2264 P (R) \u2264 R, which\nrestricts\nof state. The (GCC) condition holds for example with\n\u221a the equation\n\u03bb\nc1 = 2 if \u2212e u \u2265 1 on D. In the kinetic context of the Vlasov model\nwe derive analogous estimates on the particle level from conditions on the\ninitial data.\n\n4\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn this section we collect some general facts concerning the spherically symmetric Einstein-matter equations under the assumptions (DEC) and (NNP)\nthat have been specified in the previous section.\nA quantity which plays an important role is the quasi-local mass m(t, r).\nTypically, the spherically symmetric Einstein-matter system is supplemented by the requirement of a regular centre, i.e., \u03bb(t, 0) = 0. Using\nthis boundary condition the field equation (1.7) implies that\ne\u22122\u03bb = 1 \u2212\n\n2m\n,\nr\n\n(4.1)\n\nRr\nwhere the quasi-local mass would be given by m(t, r) := 0 4\u03c0\u03b7 2 \u03c1(t, \u03b7) d\u03b7.\nThen m(t, \u221e) is a conserved quantity, the ADM mass. However, in the\npresent context we want to investigate the system on the outer domain\nD, regardless of whether or not the solution remains regular in the region\nr < \u03b3 + (t). Hence we do not use the usual boundary condition at r = 0.\nInstead, we assume that the ADM mass M > 0 is given and redefine the\nquasi-local mass by\nZ \u221e\n4\u03c0\u03b7 2 \u03c1(t, \u03b7) d\u03b7.\n(4.2)\nm(t, r) = M \u2212\nr\n\n16\n\n\fThen limr\u2192\u221e m(t, r) = M , 0 \u2264 m \u2264 M , and mr = 4\u03c0r 2 \u03c1 holds. Defining\n\u03bb by (4.1), (3.1) shows that (1.7) and the boundary condition in (1.6) are\nsatisfied. In addition, we need to modify (2.5) to\nr\n\u25e6\nm(r) < , r \u2208]0, \u221e[,\n(4.3)\n2\na condition that once again will be included in the notion of regular initial\ndata.\nBy (1.7) and (1.8),\n\u0011\n\u0010m\n\u0010\nm\u0011\n(4.4)\n\u03bbr = 4\u03c0r\u03c1 \u2212 2 e2\u03bb , \u03bcr = 2 + 4\u03c0rp e2\u03bb .\nr\nr\nIn view of (1.6), \u03bc = \u03bc\u0302 + \u03bc\u030c, where we define\nZ \u221e\nm(t, \u03b7) 2\u03bb(t, \u03b7)\n\u03bc\u0302(t, r) := \u2212\ne\nd\u03b7,\n\u03b72\nZr \u221e\n4\u03c0\u03b7 p(t, \u03b7) e2\u03bb(t, \u03b7) d\u03b7.\n\u03bc\u030c(t, r) := \u2212\n\n(4.5)\n(4.6)\n\nr\n\nLemma 4.1 The following assertions hold.\n(a) 2\u03bc\u0302 \u2264 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bb \u2264 \u03bc\u0302 \u2264 \u03bc\u0302 + \u03bb.\n(b) \u03bc + \u03bb \u2264 \u03bc\u0302 + \u03bb.\n\nR\u221e\n(c) (\u03bc \u2212 \u03bb)(t, r) = 2\u03bc\u0302(t, r) + r 4\u03c0\u03b7 (\u03c1 \u2212 p)(t, \u03b7) e2\u03bb(t, \u03b7) d\u03b7.\nR\u221e\n(d) \u03bc\u0302t (t, r) = r 4\u03c0j(t, \u03b7) e(\u03bc+\u03bb)(t, \u03b7) e2\u03bb(t, \u03b7) d\u03b7.

The proof is short and emphasizes that the crucial mechanism is\ncaptured in the (GCC) condition. Our main results which show in particular that the (GCC) condition holds for Vlasov matter are established in the\nnext sections.\nConsider the out- and ingoing null geodesics \u03b3 + and \u03b3 \u2212 defined in\nLemma 4.3. The claims follow if we can show that these geodesics never\nintersect. By continuity and monotonicity there exists T \u2208]0, \u221e] such that\nr0 \u2264 \u03b3 + (t) < \u03b3 \u2212 (t) \u2264 r1 ,\n\nt \u2208 [0, T [;\n\n(5.1)\n\nit will be shown that actually T = \u221e holds. In view of (2.9) we have initially\nthat \u03c1 = p = j = 0 for r \u2265 R1 . The (GCC) condition implies that j \u2264 0 in\nD, meaning that the flow of matter is ingoing.

Then we show that there exists a class of initial data such that the\ncorresponding solutions satisfy the (GCC) condition with c1 = 3. Hence\nTheorem 2.2 will follow from Theorem 3.1.\nThe characteristic system associated to the Vlasov equation (2.1) is\nW\ndR\n= e(\u03bc\u2212\u03bb)(s, R)\n,\nds\nE\nL\ndW\n= \u2212\u03bbt (s, R)W \u2212 e(\u03bc\u2212\u03bb)(s, R) \u03bcr (s, R)E + e(\u03bc\u2212\u03bb)(s, R) 3 ,\nds\nR E\ndL\n= 0.\nds\n\n(6.1)\n(6.2)\n(6.3)\n\nIf s 7\u2192 (R, W, L)(s) is a solution with data (R, W, L)(0) = (r, w, L), then\n\u25e6\n\nf (s, R(s), W (s), L) = f(r, w, L)\n\u25e6\n\nis constant in s. Hence (R(s), W (s), L) \u2208 supp f (s) iff (r, w, L) \u2208 supp f.\nSuch characteristics will be addressed as characteristics in supp f .\nDirect inspection of the definition in (2.3) shows that (NNP) holds for\nVlasov matter. It is moreover well-known that the (DEC) condition is satisfied for Vlasov matter; see [1, Sec. 1.4]. Alternatively, we can check (3.2)\nand (3.3) directly. The latter follows from (6.1) above, whereas the former\nis a consequence of the expressions for the matter terms given in (2.2), (2.3),\nand (2.4).\nTo see that the (GLO) condition holds for any regular initial data set\nwe argue as follows. First of all, a regular initial data launches a local-intime solution on some time interval [0, T [, and the corresponding theorems\nin [25] or [24] also give a condition under which this local solution can be\nextended to a global one. In order to see that the local solution can always be\n22\n\n\fextended to the whole outer domain D we first observe that the spherically\nsymmetric Einstein-Vlasov system on D, with (4.1) and (4.2) replacing the\nusual boundary condition of a regular centre and with (1.10) included, has\nagain a well-posed initial value problem for regular data supported in ]r0 , \u221e[.\nThis can be shown in the same way as for the system on the whole space, the\nessential point being that no characteristic of the Vlasov equation can enter\nregion D at the boundary r = \u03b3 + (t). To the local solution on D we can now\napply the arguments from [28] and conclude that the solution exists on all\nof D. This is possible due to the fact that the estimates in [28] address a\nsituation where matter is bounded away from the centre or is controlled in a\nneighborhood of the centre so that these estimates can be applied on D. We\nemphasize that for our present analysis only the behaviour of the solution\non D plays a role. We have chosen to present our results in the form that\nwe have Vlasov matter also inside r < \u03b3 + (t), and this part of the solution\nmay or may not break down, but this is irrelevant for our arguments.\nHence it remains to show that the (GCC) condition holds. To this end\nwe let 0 < r0 < r1 < R1 , R0 = (r1 + R1 )/2, and M = r1 /2. For a parameter\n\u25e6\nW\u2212 < 0 to be specified below and regular data f with ADM mass M we\nformulate the following\n\u25e6\nGeneral support condition: For all (r, w, L) \u2208 supp f the following holds:\nr \u2208]0, r0 ] \u222a [R0 , R1 ],\nand if r \u2208 [R0 , R1 ] then\nand also\n0<L<\n\u25e6\n\nw \u2264 W\u2212\n3L \u25e6\n\u25e6\nm(\u03b7) + \u03b7 m(\u03b7), \u03b7 \u2208 [r0 , R1 ].\n\u03b7\n\n(6.4)\n\n\u25e6\n\nWe use the notation m when \u03c1 = \u03c1 in (4.2). Furthermore, we abbreviate\nr\nR1 \u2212 r1\n\u0393 = \u0393(r1 , R1 ) :=\n.\n(6.5)\nR1 + r1\nThe following lemma shows that if the support condition holds, then the\nparticles in the outer domain D keep moving inward in a controlled way.\n\u25e6\n\nLemma 6.1 Let f be regular and satisfy the general support condition for\nsome W\u2212 < 0. Then for all (r, w, L) \u2208 supp f (t) such that (t, r) \u2208 D,\nw \u2264 \u0393(r1 , R1 )W\u2212 .\nIn particular, j \u2264 0 on D.\n23\n\n\fProof : Let [0, T [ denote the maximal time interval such that for t < T\nw < 0 for (r, w, L) \u2208 supp f (t) with (t, r) \u2208 D.\n\n(6.6)\n\nSince W\u2212 < 0, T > 0 by continuity.

Therefore fix 0 < r0 <\nr1 < R0 < R1 , M = r1 /2, and 0 < Mout < M such that R0 = (r1 + R1 )/2,\n(2.6), and (2.8) are satisfied. Let 0 \u2264 f1 \u2208 C 1 have r-support in [r0 \u2212 \u03b4, r0 ]\nfor some 0 < \u03b4 < r0 /9, and let 0 \u2264 f2 \u2208 C 1 have r-support in [R0 , R1 ]. Fix\nthe compact w-support of f2 in ] \u2212 \u221e, W\u2212 ] with W\u2212 < 0 such that (6.8)\nholds, and fix its L-support in [0, L2 ] so that\n\u221a\nL2\n\u2264 \u0393(r1 , R1 ) |W\u2212 |\nr0\nand\n\n\u0011\n\u0010 3L\n+\u03b7 ,\nL < (M \u2212 Mout )\n\u03b7\n\nL \u2208 [0, L2 ],\n\n\u03b7 \u2208 [r0 , R1 ].\n\n\u25e6\n\nNow take f = Af1 + Bf2 , where A > 0 and B > 0 are chosen such that\n\u25e6\n(2.9) and (2.10) are satisfied. Note that m(\u03b7) \u2265 M \u2212 Mout for \u03b7 \u2208 [r0 , R1 ],\nwhence (6.4) holds as well; thus the general support condition if verified. It\n\u25e6\nremains to check (4.3). If r \u2208]0, r0 \u2212 \u03b4], then m(r) = 0. If r \u2208 [r0 \u2212 \u03b4, R0 ],\n\u25e6\nthen m(r) \u2264 M \u2212 Mout yields in view of (2.6),\n\u25e6\n\n2m 2(M \u2212 Mout )\n\u2264\n< 1.\nr\nr0 \u2212 \u03b4\nIf r \u2208 [R0 , \u221e[, then\n\n\u25e6\n\n2m 2M\n\u2264\n< 1,\nr\nR0\n\u25e6\n\nsince 2M = r1 < R0 . Hence f is regular and has all the properties that are\nrequired in the definition of I2 .\n\nRemark. The set I2 has \"non-empty interior\", in the sense that sufficiently\nsmall perturbations of initial data in the \"interior\" of this set belong to I2 as\nwell, provided that the support is changed very little and M is left invariant.\nThis is due to the fact that the various parameters entering into the definition\nof I2 are defined in terms of inequalities and hence can be varied.\n\n7\n\nProof of Theorem 2.1\n\nThe set up is closely related to the set up in the proof of Theorem 2.2. As\nwe saw above, the (DEC), (NNP), and (GLO) conditions are satisfied for\nVlasov matter, and we will again construct an initial data set such that the\n26\n\n\f(GCC) condition holds with c1 = 3. However, since this result relies on\ncondition (2.7) instead of (2.8), we cannot simply invoke Theorem 3.1 after\nthe (GCC) condition has been verified; instead an additional step needs to\nbe added to the proof. For this new argument a slightly stronger\ncondition\n\u25e6\non the momentum variable w needs to be imposed on supp f. We now require\nthat W\u2212 < 0 satisfies\n10\n,\n(7.1)\n\u0393(r1 , R1 )2 |W\u2212 |2 \u2265\nd\nwhere\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1 r0 r1 \u2212 r0\nd := min\n,\n,\n.\n2 12R1 300R1\nThen\nn\u25e6 \u25e6\nI1 := f | f is regular, satisfies (2.9), (2.10), the general support condition,\no\n\u221a\n\u25e6\nand for (r, w, L) \u2208 supp f with r \u2208 [R0 , R1 ], L/r0 \u2264 1.\n(7.2)\n\nThe same construction as at the end of the previous section shows that this\nset is not empty, and the same remark as at the end of the previous section\napplies.\nLet f be a solution launched by initial data from I1 . It is clear from\nthese conditions that Lemma 6.1 applies, and since 10/d \u2265 1, it follows that\n(6.10) holds as well. Thus the argument leading to \u03c1 \u2264 3|j| on D in the\nproof of Theorem 2.2 applies again. Hence, the (GCC) condition is satisfied\nwith c1 = 3.\nConsider the expression\nZ\nZ\nw2 \u0011\n\u03c0 \u221e \u221e\u0010\nf (s, r, w, L) dL dw.\nE\u2212\n\u03c1(s, r) \u2212 p(s, r) = 2\nr \u2212\u221e 0\nE\nSince \u221a\nE 2 \u2265 w2 \u2265 \u03932 (r1 , R1 ) W\u22122 by Lemma 6.1, we get for r \u2208 [\u03b3 + (s), R1 ]\nfrom L/r0 \u2264 1,\nE\u2212\n\nL\u0011\n1\n1 \u0010\n2\n2\nw2\n1+ 2 \u2264\n= (E 2 \u2212 w2 ) =\n\u2264 2 2 E =: c0 E,\nE\nE\nE\nr\nE\n\u0393 W\u2212\n\n(7.3)\n\n\u03c1(s, r) \u2212 p(s, r) \u2264 c0 \u03c1(s, r).\n\n(7.4)\n\nso that\nAfter this preparation, we again show that the out- and ingoing null\ngeodesics \u03b3 + and \u03b3 \u2212 do not intersect.

(a) The sharper estimates stated in (5.8) clearly hold also in\nthis case.\n(b) The solution must necessarily enter the regime of Step 2, more precisely,\nlim e(\u03bc\u0302+\u03bb)(s, \u03b3\n\ns\u2192\u221e\n\n\u00b1 (s))\n\n=0\n\nfor both null geodesics. Otherwise, the monotonicity implied by Eqn. (7.5)\n\u00b1\nyields a positive constant c > 0 such that e(\u03bc\u0302+\u03bb)(s, \u03b3 (s)) > c for all time,\nand hence,\n|\u03b3\u0307 \u00b1 | = e\u03bc\u2212\u03bb = e\u03bc\u0302+\u03bb e\u03bc\u030c\u22122\u03bb > ce\u03bc\u030c\u22122\u03bb .\nSince no matter can cross the two null geodesics,\nZ \u221e\n4\u03c0\u03b7(2\u03c1 \u2212 p)e2\u03bb d\u03b7 + 2\u03bc\u0302(s, r)\n(\u03bc\u030c \u2212 2\u03bb)(s, r) =\nr\nZ \u221e \u25e6\n1\nm(r0 )\nd\u03b7\n\u2265 2\u03bc\u0302(s, r) = \u22122\n\u25e6\n2 1 \u2212 2m(r\n\u03b7\n0 )/\u03b7\nr\n\u25e6\nr \u2212 2m(r0 )\n= ln\nr\nfor r = \u03b3 \u00b1 (s). If we insert this into the estimate for \u03b3\u0307 \u00b1 it follows that this\nquantity is bounded from below by a positive constant which contradicts\nthe finite limits of \u03b3 \u00b1 (s) as s \u2192 \u221e.\nIt remains to prove Cor. 2.3.\nProof of Corollary 2.3 : Let fs be a static solution. By [3], 2ms (r)/r <\n8/9 for r > 0 where ms is the local ADM mass induced by fs . In particular,\nMs < rs /2 < r1 /2 = M , and (2.6) holds. As described above we can now\n\u25e6\nspecify the matter distribution for r \u2265 r0 , and we obtain initial data f in I1\nor in I2 which coincide with the given static solution for 0 \u2264 r \u2264 r0 .\nSince no matter travels from the outer domain D to the inner one where\nr \u2264 \u03b3 + (t), the only way the matter in the outer domain can affect the static\nsolution is through the metric. Consider the time-independent version of the\nVlasov equation (2.1). Dropping all the time derivatives we see that in the\n30\n\n\fremaining equation the factor e\u03bb\u2212\u03bc can be canceled. Therefore, the static\nEinstein-Vlasov system is formulated in terms the quantities f, \u03bb, and \u03bcr ,\nbut not \u03bc itself. By (4.1) and (4.4), \u03bb and \u03bcr are on r \u2264 \u03b3 + (t) not affected\nby the matter in the outer domain D, and therefore f = fs , \u03bb, \u03bcr remain\ntime-independent for r \u2264 \u03b3 + (t).\n\u2737\nNotice that the metric coefficient \u03bc of course does change on the interior\nregion, cf. Thm 2.4 (b).\n\n8\n\nProof of Theorem 2.4\n\nAs a first step we estimate \u03bc\u2212\u03bb from below for r > 2M , using Lemma 4.1 (a):\nZ \u221e\nm(t, \u03b7) 2\u03bb(t,\u03b7)\ne\nd\u03b7\n(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bb)(t, r) \u2265 2\u03bc\u0302(t, r) = \u22122\n\u03b72\nr\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nM\nm(t, \u03b7)\n= \u22122\nd\u03b7 \u2265 \u22122\nd\u03b7\n\u03b7 (\u03b7 \u2212 2m(t, \u03b7))\n\u03b7 (\u03b7 \u2212 2M )\nr\nr\nr \u2212 2M\n= ln\n, r > 2M.\nr\nNow consider any characteristic in the matter support, and let R(t) denote\nits radial coordinate. Then by Lemma 6.1 and as long as R(t) > 2M ,\nW\nR \u2212 2M\ndR\n= e(\u03bc\u2212\u03bb)(s,R)\n\u2264 \u2212Ce(\u03bc\u2212\u03bb)(s,R) \u2264 \u2212C\n;\nds\nE\nR\nfor initial\nI2 one can take C :=\nq data from the set I1 respectively\n\u221a\n2\n2\n\u0393|W\u2212 |/ 2 + \u0393 W\u2212 respectively C := 1/ 3. Integrating this differential\ninequality we find that as long as R(t) > 2M the estimate\n\u2212Ct \u2265\n\nZ\n\nR(t)\n\nR(0)\n\nR(t) \u2212 2M\nr\ndr = R(t) \u2212 R(0) + 2M ln\nr \u2212 2M\nR(0) \u2212 2M\n\n\u2265 2M \u2212 R1 + 2M ln\n\nR(t) \u2212 2M\nR(0) \u2212 2M\n\nholds, and hence\n1\n\nR(t) \u2264 2M + (R1 \u2212 2M )e 2M (R1 \u22122M \u2212Ct) ,\nwhich proves the support estimate in part (a). Since all the matter, which\nhas ADM mass M , is contained in the region where r \u2264 2M + \u03b1e\u2212\u03b2t =:\n31\n\n\f\u03c3(t), the assertion on the metric follows. Moreover, for any r \u2264 \u03c3(t) the\nmonotonicity of \u03bc with respect to r implies that\n\u03bc(t, r) \u2264 \u03bc(t, \u03c3(t)) = \u03bc\u0302(t, \u03c3(t)) = ln\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3(t) \u2212 2M\n\u03c3(t)\n\n\u00131/2\n\n,\n\nwhich is the Rfirst assertion of part (b). The second follows immediately since\n\u221e\nthe integral 0 e\u03bc(t,r) dt is the proper length of a coordinate line of constant\nr, \u03b8, and \u03c6 in the outer region D. This completes the proof of part (b).\nAs to (c) we first observe that any radially outgoing null geodesic which\nenters the region r > 2M escapes to r = \u221e and is future complete, since by\npart (a) the metric on r > 2M + \u01eb where \u01eb > 0 is arbitrary eventually equals\nthe Schwarzschild one for which the asserted properties of the geodesics hold.\nNow consider the extremal geodesic \u03b3 \u2217 . If there existed some time t > 0\nsuch that \u03b3 \u2217 (t) > 2M , then by continuous dependence on the initial data\nthe same would be true for all radially outgoing null geodesics with \u03b3(0)\nsufficiently close to but less than r \u2217 . Hence such geodesics would escape to\nr = \u221e in contradiction to the definition of r \u2217 . This shows that the extremal,\nradially outgoing null geodesic \u03b3 \u2217 has the property that limt\u2192\u221e \u03b3 \u2217 (t) \u2264 2M .\nIt remains to show that the limit above cannot be strictly less than\n2M . To this end we consider a radially outgoing null geodesic as long as\n\u03b3(t) < \u03c3(t) = 2M + \u03b1e\u2212\u03b2t . Then\nd\u03b3\n= e(\u03bc\u2212\u03bb)(s,\u03b3(s)) \u2264 e\u03bc(s,\u03c3(s)) =\nds\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3(s) \u2212 2M\n\u03c3(s)\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u2264 Ce\u2212\u03b2s/2 ,\n\nand hence for any 0 \u2264 t0 \u2264 t and as long as \u03b3(t) < \u03c3(t),\n\u03b3(t) \u2264 \u03b3(t0 ) + Ce\u2212\u03b2t0 /2 ,\nwhere the constant C > 0 again depends only on the initial data set. Now\nassume that R\u2217 := limt\u2192\u221e \u03b3 \u2217 (t) < 2M , choose t0 > 0 such that R\u2217 +\nCe\u2212\u03b2t0 /2 < 2M , and consider the radially outgoing null geodesic \u03b3 \u2217\u2217 with\n\u03b3 \u2217\u2217 (t0 ) = R\u2217 . Then by construction, \u03b3 \u2217\u2217 (t) < 2M < \u03c3(t) for all t \u2265 t0 , and\nsince \u03b3 \u2217\u2217 (t0 ) = R\u2217 > \u03b3 \u2217 (t0 ) it follows that \u03b3 \u2217\u2217 (0) > \u03b3 \u2217 (0) = r \u2217 . Hence \u03b3 \u2217\u2217\nis a radially outgoing null geodesic which at time t = 0 starts to the right of\nr \u2217 and does not escape to r = \u221e. This is in contradiction to the definition\nof r \u2217 .\n\u2737\nWe conclude this section by proving the remark after Theorem 3.1. Under our general matter conditions the matter is ingoing in the region D, in\nparticular, the matter is for all time restricted to the region where r \u2264 R1 .\n32\n\n\fHence for r \u2265 R1 the metric is again equal to the Schwarzschild one with\nmass M , and if we replace 2M by R1 in the above argument for part (c)\nwe obtain the assertions on \u03b3 \u2217 in the general matter context. As to the\ndivergence of \u03bc we observe that\nd\nd\u03b3 \u2212\n\u03bc\u0302(s, \u03b3 \u2212 (s)) = \u03bc\u0302t (s, \u03b3 \u2212 (s)) + \u03bc\u0302r (s, \u03b3 \u2212 (s))\n(s) \u2264 0\nds\nds\nso that the limit \u03bc\u0302\u221e := lims\u2192\u221e \u03bc\u0302(s, \u03b3 \u2212 (s)) exists. The fact that \u03b3 \u2212 (s) > 0\nis decreasing with\nd\u03b3 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n(s) = e(\u03bc\u2212\u03bb)(s,\u03b3 (s)) \u2265 e2\u03bc\u0302(s,\u03b3 (s)) \u2265 e2\u03bc\u0302\u221e ,\nds\nimplies that \u03bc\u0302\u221e = \u2212\u221e. Since \u03bc \u2264 \u03bc\u0302 we conclude that\nlim \u03bc(s, \u03b3 \u2212 (s)) = \u2212\u221e,\n\ns\u2192\u221e\n\nfrom which the assertion follows by the monotonicity of \u03bc with respect to r.\nAcknowledgement : The authors are grateful for discussions with A.
