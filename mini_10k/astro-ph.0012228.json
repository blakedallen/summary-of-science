Parsec-scale VLBA imaging of five Seyfert galaxies with flatspectrum radio nuclei was conducted to determine whether the flat spectrum represents thermal emission from the accretion disk/obscuring torus\nor nonthermal, synchrotron self-absorbed emission. Four of the five show\nemission consistent with synchrotron self-absorption, with intrinsic sizes\n\u223c0.05\u22120.2 pc (or 104 gravitational radii for a 108 M\u2299 black hole for the\nsmallest). In contrast, NGC 4388, which was detected with MERLIN but\nnot the VLBA, shows thermal emission with similar properties to that\ndetected in NGC 1068. It is notable that the two Seyfert galaxies with\ndetected thermal nuclear radio emission both have large X-ray absorbing\ncolumns, suggesting that columns in excess of \u223c1024 cm\u22122 are needed for\nsuch disks to be detectable.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAGN are thought to be powered by accretion of material onto a central supermassive black hole via a disk that regulates the fueling rate. The extent\nof these disks is not well established but AGN unification schemes advocate\na geometrically thick or warped thin disk that hides the nucleus when viewed\nedge-on and accounts for the observed differences between broad (type 1) and\nnarrow-line (type 2) AGN. Theoretical work indicates that UV/X-ray radiation\nfrom the central engine can heat, ionize and evaporate gas on the inner edge\nof the torus1 and recent high angular resolution VLBA radio observations of\nthe archetypal Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC 1068, have shown that emission from the\nflat-spectrum radio component 'S1' may be associated with the thermal gas on\nthe inner, ionized edge of the torus2 . This discovery highlights the possibility\nof using the VLBA to image the pc-scale disks or tori in other Seyfert galaxies.\nFlat-spectrum nuclei in radio galaxies and quasars often represent non-thermal\nsynchrotron self-absorbed radio emission with a much higher brightness temperature (>108 K) than is characteristic of component S1 in NGC 1068, so\nhigh resolution radio observations are required to distinguish between the two\nemission processes.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMundell et al.\nT0109-383\n0\n\n5\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nVLA - 8.4 GHz\n\nVLBA - 8.4 GHz\n\n56.0\n56.5\n57.0\n\n00.474\n00.476\n00.478\n00.480\n\n01\n\n02\n\n4 mas\n0.91 pc\n\n00.486\n\n58.5\n01 09 09.95 09.90 09.85 09.80 09.75 09.70 09.65 09.60 09.55\nRIGHT ASCENSION (B1950)\n\n5\n\n01 11 27.642\n\nVLA - 1.4 GHz\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n05 52 11.376\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\n0\n\n6\n\n-08 57 19.0\n\nVLBA - 8.4 GHz\n\n50\n\n33.516\n33.514\n33.512\n33.510\n\n45\n\n33.504\n13 35 45.0\n\n44.5\n44.0\n43.5\nRIGHT ASCENSION (B1950)\n\n20.0\n\n20.5\n\n3\n\n4\n\nVLBA - 8.4 GHz\n\n4 mas\n1.8 pc\n13 38 15.870\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\n08.624\n08.626\n08.628\n08.630\n08.632\n08.634\n\n21.0\n\n33.508\n33.506\n\n2\n\n08.622\n19.5\n\n33.518\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n47 55\n\n1\n\n-08 41 08.620\n\nVLA - 8.4 GHz\nDECLINATION (B1950)\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\nDECLINATION (B1950)\n\n00\n\n4 mas\n0.59 pc\n\n22.522\n\n33.520\n\n05\n\n22.516\n\n05 49 46.55 46.50 46.45 46.40 46.35 46.30 46.25 46.20\nRIGHT ASCENSION (B1950)\n\n27.641\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\n04 32 33.522\n\n04 48 10\n\n22.514\n\nMkn 926\n0\n\n10\n\n22.512\n\n22.520\n\n04\n\nNGC 5252\n0\n\n22.510\n\n22.518\n\n00.484\n\n58.0\n\n22.508\n\n03\n\n00.482\n\n57.5\n\n15\n\n22.506\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n55.5\n\n10\n\nVLBA - 8.4 GHz\n\n-07 28 00\n\n00.472\n\nDECLINATION (B1950)\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n55.0\n\n5\n\nVLA - 8.4 GHz\n\n00.470\n\n54.5\n\n0\n\n60\n\n-07 27 22.504\n\n-38 05 00.468\n\n-38 20 54.0\n\nDECLINATION (B1950)\n\nNGC 2110\n0\n\n10\n\n08.636\n21.5\n23 02 07.25\n\n4 mas\n3.8 pc\n\n08.638\n07.20\n07.15\n07.10\nRIGHT ASCENSION (B1950)\n\n23 04 43.478\n\n43.477\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\nFigure 1.\n\n8.4-GHz continuum images (right-hand panel) of sources detected with VLBA: T0109-383, NGC 2110, NGC 5252 and Mkn 926; VLA\nimage of larger scale structure also shown (left-hand panel).\n\n2.\n\nThe Search for Thermally-Emitting Disks3\n\nFour of five sources imaged with the VLBA at 8.4 GHz were detected (Figure 1)\nand show compact, unresolved nuclei with brightness temperatures, TB > 108\nK, monochromatic luminosities \u223c1021 W Hz\u22121 and sizes less than \u223c1 pc. We\nconclude that the sub-pc scale radio emission in these sources is non-thermal and\nself absorbed, and hence dominated by the central engine. We find no significant\nevidence of thermal disk-like emission extended perpendicular to the collimation\naxis in these sources. In contrast, the nucleus of NGC 4388 is not detected with\nthe VLBA but is detected with MERLIN at 5 GHz. The inferred brightness\ntemperature of 2.4 \u00d7 104 K < TB < 2.2 \u00d7 106 K is too low for synchrotron\nself absorption to be important and we propose a model in which the emission\nis optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung from a gas with electron temperature\nof Te > 104.5 K and density ne > 1.6 \u00d7 104 f \u22120.5 cm\u22123 (f is the volume filling\nfactor). The larger inferred values of Te = 106.8 K and ne = 1.8 \u00d7 106 f \u22120.5 cm\u22123\nfor the smaller source size set by the VLBA limit, are similar to the values\nof \u223c106.8 K and \u223c106.8 cm\u22123 found for thermal emission in NGC 10682 , thus\nimplying that we may be seeing the same phenomenon in NGC 4388. It is notable\nthat these two Seyferts with detected thermal nuclear radio emission have large\nX-ray absorbing columns, suggesting that columns in excess of \u223c1024 cm\u22122 are\nneeded for such disks to be detectable.\nReferences\n1.
