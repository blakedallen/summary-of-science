We deem it necessary to clarify all the question on the\nbasis of a rigorous formalism, in part original, and of clear physical considerations. In\nparticular we clarify, by explicit calculations based on Maxwell equations only, that, at\nvariance with what assumed by some authors: (i) the \"X-waves\" exist in all space, and in\nparticular inside both the front and the rear part of their double cone (that has nothing to\ndo with Cherenkov's); (ii) they have not been found heuristically, via ad hoc assumptions,\nbut by use of strict mathematical (or experimental) procedures; (iii) the ideal X-waves\n(as well as plane waves) are actually endowed with infinite energy, but finite-energy Xwaves can be easily constructed (even without space-time truncations): And at the end\nof this work, by following an original technique, we construct exact finite-energy solutions\n(totally free from backward-traveling waves); (iv) the large majority of the researchers\nworking in this area do not aim at using the X-waves for \"superluminal transmission of information\", but are interested in the circumstance that they are localized waves, endowed\nwith a self-reconstruction property, and in their important practical applications (in part\nalready realized, since 1992); (v) an actual attempt at comparing Cherenkov radiation\nand X-waves would lead one to consider the very different situation of the (X-shaped, too)\nfield generated by a superluminal point-charge, a question actually exploited in previous\npapers, appeared e.g. in 2004 in Phys.Rev.E [3]: We show here explicitly that in this case\nthe point-charge would not lose energy in the vacuum, and that the field generated by it\nwould not need to be continuously feeded by incoming side-waves (as it is indeed the case\nfor an ideal, ordinary X-wave).\nAs already said, we wish to reply to attempts, like the one in Ref.[1], at setting forth\n\"Cherenkov-Vavilov formulations of the X-shaped Localized Waves\" (in the following we\nshall write only \"Cherenkov\" for brevity's sake). The classical problem of the Cherenkov\nradiation[4] from a point-charge traveling in a medium with speed v such that cn < v < c,\nwhere cn and c are the speed of light in the medium and in the vacuum, respectively, is\nnormally investigated in correct terms. Also in [1] it is presented in a mathematically\ncorrect way; sometimes, however, the language used in such a context is ambiguous: For\nexample, in [1] the speed cn in the medium is just called c; furthermore, the point-charge\nassociated with the Cherenkov radiation is called \"superluminal\", despite the fact that\nits speed is smaller than the light-speed in the vacuum. In the existing theoretical and\nexperimental literature on Localized Waves (see again, e.g., Ref.[2]) and in particular on\nX-shaped waves[5, 6], the word superluminal is reserved to group-speeds actually larger\nthan the speed of light in the vacuum. These ambiguities create difficulties, especially\n3\n\n\fwhenever a comparison is made of the Cherenkov radiation with X-shaped waves. Let\nus repeat that, in reality, the latter belong to a very different realm; and exist even in\nvacuum as localized non-diffracting pulses, propagating rigidly with superluminal (in our\nlanguage) peak-velocities, V > c, independently of any media. Let us try to clarify the\nwhole subject, and several unjustified implications in papers like [1], by using a rigorous\nformalism and clear physical considerations.\nOur specific considerations and comments are as follows:\n1) - As already mentioned, the papers addressing the Cherenkov effect do incorporate\nsometimes[1] an ambiguous terminology (see above), about which the readers must be\nwarned. Except for the ambiguous notation, the analysis of the ordinary scalar-valued\nCherenkov radiation in normally correct -cf., e.g., the first part of [1]- as it can be\nexplicitly checked; anyway, the relevant results are well-known[4]. Except for the ambiguous notation, the analysis of the ordinary scalar-valued Cherenkov radiation in the\nfirst part of [1] is correct, as it can be explicitly checked; however, the relevant results\nseem to be already known[4]. It can be pointed out, incidentally, that even the vectorvalued electromagnetic fields generated by a really superluminal point-charge, endowed\nwith speed V > c, have already been considered and published in [3] using a procedure\ntotally different, of course, from the one followed e.g. in [1].\n2) - The main equivocal aspect of works like [1] is that such authors attempt at\nusing the ordinary Cherenkov radiation to draw conclusions about superluminal Localized\nWaves (LW) known as X-shaped waves (or simply X-waves). The latter, as we said,\nare nondiffractive solutions to the homogeneous wave equations and propagate rigidly\nwith superluminal peak-velocities. They have been predicted long ago[7, 8], have been\nmathematically constructed[5], and finite-energy versions of these wave-packets have been\nexperimentally produced[6] in the vacuum, independently of any media. We are going to\nshow the drawbacks of the path followed in articles as [1] by using explicit calculations.\nTo be clear and self-contained, we initially address the (simpler) scalar case, in which\na field \u03c8 is governed by the inhomogeneous wave equation\n!\n\n1 \u22022\n4\u03c0\n\u2207 \u2212 2 2 \u03c8(r, t) = \u2212 j(r, t)\ncn \u2202t\ncn\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwith j = qv \u03b4(\u03c1) \u03b4(z \u2212 vt)/(2\u03c0\u03c1). Here cn is the speed of light in the considered medium\n4\n\n\fand j(r, t) is the generating source, assumed to be pointlike and moving along the positive\nz-axis with subluminal speed cn < v < c, while \u03c1 denotes the cylindrical radial coordinate.\nA Green's function for Eq.(1) is given explicitly as\nG(r, t, r \u2032 , t\u2032 ) = l G+ (r, t, r \u2032 , t\u2032 ) + (1 \u2212 l) G\u2212 (r, t, r \u2032 , t\u2032 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\u03b4 (t\u2032 \u2212 (t \u2213 R/cn ))\ncn R\n\nG\u00b1 (r, t, r \u2032 , t\u2032 ) =\nq\n\n(3)\n\nand R \u2261 (z \u2212 z \u2032 )2 + \u03c12 + \u03c1\u20322 \u2212 2\u03c1\u03c1\u2032 cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032 ).\nQuantities G+ and G\u2212 are the retarded and advanced Green's functions, respectively.\nWhen considering only the retarded Green's function (l = 1), the solution to the wave\nequation can be expressed as\n\u03c8(r, t) =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u20323\n\ndx\n\ndt\u2032 G+ (r, t, r \u2032 , t\u2032 ) j(r \u2032 , t\u2032 ) .\n\n(4)\n\nWe can use the expression for G+ given in Eq.(3) for a direct calculation of the wave\nfunction \u03c8(r, t). However, for reasons that will be made clear in the sequel, we shall\nfollow the procedure adopted in papers like [1]. Specifically, we shall determine the Fourier\ntransform of G+ in the variables z and t, and subsequently the transform of \u03c8 in the same\nvariables.

The radiation exists\nonly inside the rear part \u03b6 = \u2212\u03b3n\u22121 \u03c1 of the Cherenkov cone.\nAs to the vectorial case, physically more significant, let us only mention that is can\nbe constructed by adopting the Lorentz gauge, and by considering the vector potential\nA = Az \u00eaz , with Az \u2261 \u03c8 and the current density j = jz \u00eaz , with jz \u2261 j.\n2a) \u2013 Some authors, as the ones of Ref.[1], have been induced at looking for a\nconnection between the Cherenkov emission and X-shaped waves. The simple X-waves to\nwhich many authors refer to are solutions to the homogeneous scalar wave equation: They\nare wave functions of the type X(\u03c1, z, t) = X(\u03c1, \u03b6), with \u03b6 \u2261 z \u2212V t and cn < V < \u221e, and\ncan be obtained by suitable superpositions of axially symmetric Bessel beams, propagating\nin the positive z-direction with the same phase-velocity (cf., e.g., Refs.[5]); precisely,\nZ\n\n\u03c9q 2 2\nV /c \u2212 1)ei\u03c9/V \u03b6\n(7)\nV\n0\nwhere J0 (.) is an ordinary zero-order Bessel function and S(\u03c9) is the temporal frequency\nspectrum. Incidentally, let us stress that Eq.(7) represents a particular case of the\nsuperluminal waves, which in their turn are just a particular case of the (subluminal,\nluminal or superluminal) Localized Waves. For the specific spectrum S(\u03c9) = exp[\u2212a\u03c9],\nwith a a positive constant, one obtains the zero-order (classic) X-wave:\n\u03c8X (\u03c1, \u03b6) =\n\n\u221e\n\nd \u03c9S(\u03c9)J0(\u03c1\n\nV\nX \u2261 X(\u03c1, \u03b6) = q\n.\n(aV \u2212 i\u03b6)2 + (V 2 /c2 \u2212 1)\u03c12\n\n(8)\n\nAuthors like the ones in Ref.[1] are led to attempt a comparison between the Cherenkov\neffect and the zero-order X-wave by the apparent mathematical similarity of equations (5)\nand (7) [which correspond, for instance, to equations (7) and (13) of Ref.[1].] To be more\nspecific: (i) we have seen that for the inhomogeneous wave-equation (1), a Cherenkov\nsolution of the type given in Eq.(6) exists only inside the cone rear part \u03b6 = \u2212\u03b3 \u22121 \u03c1. To\nobtain a solution existing only inside the cone forward part \u03b6 = \u03b3 \u22121 \u03c1, one should make\nuse of the advanced Green's function G\u2212 : This -to go on with our example- induced\nthe authors in [1] to state that the forward part of the X-wave is non-causal; (ii) Another\npoint that misled Walker and Kuperman[1] is that, if one puts S(\u03c9) = i into the \u03c8X -wave\n(7), that is, if one sets a = 0 in Eq.(8) and multiplies it by i, one obtains\nV\nf\nX(\u03c1,\n\u03b6) = q\n,\n\u03b6 2 \u2212 (V 2 /c2 \u2212 1)\u03c12\n6\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhich is mathematically identical, apart from a constant, to the Cherenkov solution in\nEq.(6]), with a real part existing this time inside both the rear cone \u03b6 = \u2212\u03b3 \u22121 \u03c1 and\nthe forward cone \u03b6 = \u03b3 \u22121 \u03c1. The statement in papers like [1] that the advanced part of\nthe zero-order X-wave [cf. Eq.(8)] is non-causal is due to an illicit extrapolation. Being\na solutions to the homogeneous wave equation, the X-wave cannot admit singularities.\nIn contrast, the solution given in Eq.(9), which was obtained from the Bessel beam superposition (7) using a constant spectrum S(\u03c9), does have singularities and cannot be\nconsidered a solution to the homogeneous wave equation. Actually, the real part of the\nsolution (9) can be an acceptable solution for the inhomogeneous case only: Indeed, we\nshall show later on that it represents the field of a point-charge traveling with speed V > c\nwhen using as a Green's function the expression G = G+ /2 + G\u2212 /2, half retarded and\nhalf advanced (which means, again, that it refers to an inhomogeneous problem).\nIt should be pointed out that the Bessel beam synthesis in Eq.(7) is a particular case of\nmore general spectral representations leading not only to infinite but also to finite energy\nsuperluminal LWs[2, 5]. Not less important, even a finite-energy close replica of the the\nclassic X-wave (8) (endowed, incidentally, also with a finite field-depth) can be generated\nin a causal manner by means of a \"dynamic\" finite aperture (antennas, holographic or\noptical elements, etc.). For instance, it is enough an array of circular elements excited\naccording to the function X(\u03c1, z = 0, t), given by equations (7) or (8) on the aperture\nplane located at z = 0. The emitted finite-energy X-wave can be calculated by means of\nthe Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (II) formula [9]\n\u03c8RS(II) (\u03c1, z, t) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nD/2\n\n(\n\n1\n(z \u2212 z \u2032 )\n(z \u2212 z \u2032 )\n\u2032\nd\u03c1 \u03c1\n[X]\nX]\n+\n[\u2202\ncn t\n2\u03c0R\nR2\nR\n\u2032 \u2032\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\n\u2032\nThe quantities inside\nq the square brackets are evaluated at the retarded time cn t = cn t\u2212R.\nThe distance R = (z \u2212 z \u2032 )2 + \u03c12 + \u03c1\u20322 \u2212 2\u03c1\u03c1\u2032 cos (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 ) is now the separation between\nsource and observation points, and the aperture diameter is denoted by D. The depth\nof field of the particular solution given in Eq.(10) is known[10] to be Z = R\u03b3n .\nWhat stated above has been theoretically (even via numerical simulations...) and\nexperimentally verified, as published in a large number of well-known papers: see, for\nexample, Refs.[5, 6, 11, 10, 12, 13, 2].\n\n2b) \u2013 We agree with authors as Walker and Kuperman[1] that the superluminal\nspot of any X-wave is fed by the waves coming from the elements of the aperture, and\nthat these waves carry energy with at most luminal (V = cn ) speed. In such cases, the\n7\n\n\fX-wave intensity peaks at two different locations are not causally correlated. But such a\ncorrect claim, contained also in [1], is well known and firmly accepted since the nineties\nby practically all the scholars working in the area of LWs (cf., e.g., the references in\n[14] and [13], as well as Refs.[2, 5, 10, 11]): The claim in [1] that efforts in the area of\nX-waves are aimed at transmitting information superluminally is not correct. The large\nmajority of the experts in such a subject are interested in X-waves due to their spatiotemporal localization, unidirectionality, \"soliton-like\", and self-reconstruction properties\nin the near-to-far zone. Such properties bear interesting consequences, from theoretical\nand experimental points of view in all sectors of physics in which a role is played by\na wave equation (including -mutatis mutandis- elementary particle physics, and even\ngravitation).\n3) - The statement, contained in papers like [1], that the (ideal) zero-order X-wave in\nEq.(7) has infinite energy (as well as the plane-waves) does not convey new information.\nThe fact that such a solution needs to be fed for an infinite time has been known since the\nstart of LW theory. In any case, as mentioned earlier, such a problem can be overcome\neither by using (cf. Eq.(10)) apertures finite in space and time, i.e., by truncating the\nX-wave, or by constructing exact, analytical finite-energy solutions[12, 11]. For reasons\nof space, we shall show only briefly, but in an original rigorous way, how closed-form\nsolutions of the latter type can be actually constructed, without any recourse to the\nbackward-traveling waves that trouble the ordinary approaches: See point 5) below.\nHere, for the moment, let us recall that X-waves endowed by themselves with finite\nenergy even without truncation have been easily constructed in the past by use of diffraction integrals: See, for instance, the approximate solution in Eqs.(2.31),(2.32) of Ref.[15],\nthat is, the \"SMPS pulse\", which is depicted in Figs.1. A finite-energy X-wave gets deformed while propagating: and Fig.1(b) shows the pulse in Fig.1(a) after it has travelled\n50 km.\nLet us emphasize, as well, that the formulations leading to LWs, and to X-waves, are\nnot chosen ad hoc, as believed in papers as [1], but are to be based on proper choices\nof the spectra (which imply a specific space-time coupling[12, 11, 16]) and of the Bessel\nfunctions (in order to avoid singularities both at \u03c1 = 0 and at \u03c1 = \u221e): In contrast,\nthe choice suggested, e.g., in Eq.(15) of [1] presents singularities. To be clearer, let us\nobserve that a general solution to the scalar homogeneous wave-equation in free space can\nbe written [when eliminating evanescent waves] in the form\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 1: Example of an X-type LW endowed with finite energy (even without truncation),\nand that consequently gets deformed while propagating: (b) represents the pulse depicted\nin (a) after it has traveled 50 km. See Ref.[15], and the text.\n\n\u03c8(\u03c1, \u03c6, z, t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bd=\u2212\u221e\n\n\uf8ee\nZ\n\uf8f0\n\n\u221e\n0\n\nZ\n\n\uf8eb s\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u03c92\nd\u03c9\ndkz A\u03bd (kz , \u03c9)J\u03bd \uf8ed\u03c1 2 \u2212 kz2 \uf8f8 eikz z e\u2212i\u03c9t ei\u03bd\u03c6 \uf8fb\nc\n\u2212\u03c9/c\n\u03c9/c\n\n(11)\n\nby considering positive angular frequencies \u03c9 only. For obtaining ideal LWs propagating\nalong the positive z-direction with peak-velocity V (that can assume a priori any value\n0 \u2264 V \u2264 \u221e), the spectra A\u03bd must have the form:[12, 2, 16]\nA\u03bd (kz , \u03c9) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nS\u03bd\u03bc (\u03c9) \u03b4[\u03c9 \u2212 (V kz + b\u03bc )]\n\n(12)\n\n\u03bc=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere b\u03bc = 2\u03c0\u03bcV /\u2206z0 , and it can be easily shown[12, 16] that solution (11) possesses\nthe important property \u03c8(\u03c1, \u03c6, z, t) = \u03c8(\u03c1, \u03c6, z + \u2206z0 , t + \u2206z0 /V ), where \u2206z0 is a chosen\nspace-interval along z. The last two equations already show that LWs are not to be\nfound by \"ad hoc\" assumptions: Equation (12) does explicitly show that -as mentioned\nabove- the ideal LWs exist only in correspondence with linear relations between \u03c9 and\nkz , that is, with specific space-time couplings. By assuming in particular A0 (kz , \u03c9) \u2261\nA\u03bd (kz , \u03c9) = \u03b4\u03bd0 S(\u03c9) \u0398(kz ) \u03b4[\u03c9 \u2212 (V kz + \u03b10 )], where the Heaviside function \u0398 does\neliminate, as desired, any backward components, and \u03b10 is a constant, we can construct\nan infinite number of subluminal, luminal, or superluminal Localized Solutions, with axial\nsymmetry, and in closed form. For instance, the X-shaped waves represented in Eq.(7),\nand used for the sake of comparison also in Ref.[1], correspond to the particular value\n9\n\n\f\u03b10 = 0. [To get finite-energy solutions one has to abandon the strict request of a linear\nrelation between \u03c9 and kz , and impose instead that the spectral functions A(kz , \u03c9) possess\nnon negligible values only in the vicinity of a straight line of the mentioned type[12]: This\nis briefly exploited under point 5) below].\n4) - We have already established that the analogy attempted in works like [1] between\nthe Cherenkov radiation and the X-wave solution is not justified even in material media.\nIn the case of vacuum, the aforementioned analogy should have rather led one to consider\nthe field generated by a really superluminal point-charge: A problem that was investigated\nin [3], and refs. therein. In such a situation, the point-charge superluminally traveling in\nthe vacuum is not expected to radiate due to physical reasons published long ago[17, 8, 18].\nSuch a charge does not radiate in its rest-frame[8, 18] and, consequently, does not radiate\nalso according to observers for whom it is superluminal[17]. We shall establish this result\nbelow, by explicit calculations based on Maxwell equations only.\nLet us consider the wave equation (1) in vacuum (cn \u2192 c) with a superluminally\nmoving (v \u2192 V > c) point charge source. Use of the Green's function G = (G+ + G\u2212 )/2\n(cf., e.g., Refs.[19, 20]) yields the following integral representation for the solution:\nZ\n\nq \u221e\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03c8(\u03c1, \u03b6, t) =\n(13)\nd\u03c9 N0 (\u03c1 \u03b3 \u22121 ) cos( \u03b6) ,\nc 0\nV\nV\nwhere N0 is the zero-orderqNeumann function, and, now, \u03b2n and \u03b3n have been replaced\nwith \u03b2 \u2261 V /c and \u03b3 \u22121 \u2261 V 2 /c2 \u2212 1. The integration can be carried out explicitly, and\nyields, for the field generated by a point-charge traveling superluminally in the vacuum,\nthe expression\n\n\u03c8(\u03c1, z, t) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nh\n\nq\u03b2 \u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03c12 \u03b3 \u22122\n\ni\u22121/2\n\nwhen\n\n0 < \u03c1\u03b3 \u22121 < |\u03b6|\n(14)\n\n0\n\nelsewhere .\n\nThis solution is different from zero inside the rear and front parts of the unlimited double\ncone[3, 14] generated by the rotation around the z-axis of the straight lines \u03c1 = \u00b1\u03b3\u03b6, in\nagreement with the predictions of the \"extended\" (or, rather, \"non-restricted\") theory of\nSpecial Relativity[8, 18]. The expression in Eq.(14) is precisely equivalent to the solution\ngiven by Eq.(8) in our Ref.[3]; except for a constant that was wrong therein.\nGoing on to the (physically more suited) vectorial formalism, adopting the Lorentz\ngauge, and choosing a current density j = jz \u00eaz ; jz \u2261 j, a scalar electric potential\n\n10\n\n\f\u03c6 = c\u03c8/V and a vector magnetic potential A \u2261 \u03c8\u00eaz (cf. Fig.2 in Ref.[3], which refers to\na negative point-charge), one obtains, in analogy to [3], the electric and magnetic fields\nE(\u03c1, \u03b6) = \u2212q\u03b3 \u22122 Y (\u03c1 \u00ea\u03c1 + \u03b6 \u00eaz ) ;\n\nB = \u2212q\u03b2\u03b3 \u22122 Y \u03c1 \u00ea\u03b8 ,\n\n(15)\n\nin Gaussian units; where\nh\n\nY \u2261 \u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03c12 \u03b3 \u22122\n\ni\u22123/2\n\ninside the double cone (i.e., for 0 < \u03c1\u03b3 \u22121 < |\u03b6|), while Y = 0 outside it (that is, E and\nB are zero outside it). The corresponding Poynting vector is given by\nc 2 \u22124 2\nq \u03b2\u03b3 Y \u03c1 (\u03c1 \u00eaz \u2212 \u03b6 \u00ea\u03c1 ) .\n(16)\n4\u03c0\nThe total flux, through any closed surface containing the point-charge at the considered\ninstant of time, is equal to zero. Thus, a point-charge traveling at a constant superluminal\nspeed in vacuum does not radiate energy. This fact is depicted and explained in an\nintuitive way in Fig.4 of Ref.[3], which originally appeared in Refs.[7, 8] and, for clarity,\nis reproduced in this article as Fig.2.\nWe wish to emphasize that in the present case the field needs not be fed, at variance\nwith the case of the ordinary X-waves. Once more, one can see that the analogy exploited\nin papers like [1] between the Cherenkov effect and the X-waves completely breaks down\nin the case of the vacuum.\nEventually, most authors do not address many of the other interesting physical points.\nFor example, no mention appears in [1] of the fact that a superluminal charge is expected\nto behave as a magnetic pole, in the sense fully clarified in Refs.[21, 7, 8]. One can see\neven from Eqs.(15) that E \u2192 0, and one is left with a pure magnetic field, in the limit\nV \u2192 \u221e.\nS=\n\n5) - At last, as anticipated in point 3) above, finite-energy solutions can be obtained in\nclosed form without any recourse to the backward-traveling waves that trouble the usual\napproaches (even if the intervention of such components has been already minimized\nin Refs.[12, 11], at the cost -however- of going on to frequency spectra with a very\nlarge bandwidth). In fact, when confining ourselves to superluminal LWs with axial\nsymmetry, let us put in Eq.(11) A\u03bd (kz , \u03c9) = \u03b4\u03bd0 A(kz , \u03c9), and adopt the \"unidirectional\ndecomposition\"\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 2: This figure -appeared in Ref.[3], but taken from Ref.[8]- does intuitively show,\namong the others, that a Superluminal charge[17, 18, 7, 8, 13, 14] traveling at constant\nspeed in the vacuum, would not lose energy: see [3] and the text.\n\n\u03b6 \u2261 z \u2212 Vt;\n\n\u03b7 \u2261 z \u2212 ct .\n\nIn terms of the new variables\u2217 and confining ourselves now to V > c, equation (11) can\nbe rewritten as\n\n\u03c8(\u03c1, \u03b6, \u03b7) = (V \u2212 c)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\nd\u03c3\n\nZ\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0012 q\n\nd\u03b1J0 \u03c1\n\n\u03b3 \u22122 \u03c3 2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 2(\u03b2 \u2212 1)\u03c3\u03b1 exp[\u2212i\u03b1\u03b7] exp[i\u03c3\u03b6]A(\u03b1, \u03c3)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2261 (\u03c9 \u2212 V kz )/(V \u2212 c) and \u03c3 \u2261 (\u03c9 \u2212 ckz )/(V \u2212 c).\n\u2217\n\nThe same variables were adopted in Ref.[22] in the paraxial approximation context, while we are\naddressing the general exact case\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 3: Example of a finite-energy X-type LW, corresponding to an exact, analytic\nsolution of Eq.18, totally free from backward-components.

The value \u03c9min can be regarded as the pulse central frequency;\nsince \u2206\u03c9/\u03c9min << 1, it exists a well-defined carrier wave, which does clearly show up in\nthe plots. Any finite-energy LW gets deformed while propagating, and (b) represents the\npulse depicted in (a) after it has traveled 2.78 km.\nAs mentioned above, ideal (infinite energy) superluminal LWs are got by imposing\nthe linear constraint A(\u03b1, \u03c3) = B(\u03c3) \u03b4(\u03b1 + \u03b10 ). By contrast, finite-energy superluminal\nLWs are obtained by concentrating the spectrum A(\u03b1, \u03c3) in the vicinity of the straight\nline \u03b1 = \u2212\u03b10 .
