One of the easiest ways to determine the magnetic field direction is via\npolarization of radiation resulting from extinction on or/and emission by aligned\ndust grains. Reliability of interpretation of the polarization maps in terms of magnetic fields depends on how well we understand the grain-alignment theory. Explaining what makes grains aligned has been one of the big issues of the modern\nastronomy. Numerous exciting physical effects have been discovered in the course\nof research undertaken in this field. As both the theory and observations matured,\nit became clear that the grain-alignment phenomenon is inherent not only in diffuse interstellar medium or molecular clouds but also is a generic property of the\ndust in circumstellar regions, interplanetary space and cometary comae. Currently\nthe grain-alignment theory is a predictive one, and its results nicely match observations. Among its predictions is a subtle phenomenon of radiative torques. This\nphenomenon, after having stayed in oblivion for many years after its discovery, is\ncurrently viewed as the most powerful means of alignment. In this article, I shall\nreview the basic physical processes involved in grain alignment, and the currently\nknown mechanisms of alignment. I shall also discuss possible niches for different\nalignment mechanisms. I shall dwell on the importance of the concept of grain\nhelicity for understanding of many properties of grain alignment, and shall demonstrate that rather arbitrarily shaped grains exhibit helicity when they interact with\ngaseous and radiative flows.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMagnetic fields are of an utmost importance for most astrophysical systems.\nConducting matter is entrained on magnetic field lines, and magnetic pressure and tension are very important for its dynamics. For instance, galactic\nmagnetic fields play key role in many processes, including star formation,\nmediating shocks, influencing heat and mass transport, modifying turbulence\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n1 June 2018\n\n\fetc. Aligned dust grains trace the magnetic field and provide a unique source\nof information about magnetic field structure and topology. The new instruments, Sharc II (Novak et al. 2004), Scuba II (Bastien, Jenness & Molnar\n2005), and an intended polarimeter for SOFIA open new horizons for studies\nof astrophysical magnetic fields via polarimetry.\nThe enigma that has surrounded grain alignment since its discovery in 1949\n(Hall 1949; Hiltner 1949) makes one wonder how reliable is polarimetry as a\nway of magnetic field studies. In fact, for many years grain alignment theory\nused to have a very limited predictive power and was an issue of hot debates.\nWorks by great minds like Lyman Spitzer and Edward Purcell moved the\nfield forward, but the solution looked illusive. In fact, the reader can see from\nthe review, that a number of key physical processes have been discovered\nonly recently. Fig. 1a demonstrates the complexity of grain motion as we\nunderstand it now.\nThe weakness of the theory caused a somewhat cynical approach to it among\nsome of the polarimetry practitioners who preferred to be guided in their work\nby the following rule of thumb: All grains are always aligned and the alignment\nhappens with the longer grain axes perpendicular to magnetic field. This simple\nrecipe was shattered, however, by observational data which indicated that\nI. Grains of sizes smaller than a critical size are either not aligned or marginally\naligned (Mathis 1986, Kim & Martin 1995).\nII. Carbonaceous grains are not aligned, while silicate grains are aligned (see\nMathis 1986).\nIII. A substantial part of small grains grains deep within molecular clouds are\nnot aligned (Goodman et al. 1995, Lazarian, Goodman & Myers 1997, Cho &\nLazarian 2005 and references therein).\nVI. Grains might be aligned with longer axes parallel to magnetic fields (Rao\net al 1998).\nThese facts were eloquent enough to persuade even the most sceptical types\nthat the interpretation of interstellar polarimetric data does require an adequate theory. A further boost of the interest to grain alignment came from the\nsearch of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization (see Lazarian &\nFinkbeiner 2003, for a review). Aligned dust in this case acts as a source of\na ubiquitous foreground that is necessary to remove from the data. It is clear\nthat understanding of grain alignment is the key element for such a removal.\nWhile alignment of interstellar dust is a generally accepted fact, the alignment\nof dust in conditions other than interstellar has not been fully appreciated. A\ncommon explanation of light polarization from comets or circumstellar regions\nis based on light scattering by randomly oriented particles (see Bastien 1988\nfor a review). The low efficiency and slow rates of alignment were sometimes\nquoted to justify such an approach. However, it has been proved recently\n2\n\n\fthat grain alignment is an efficient and rapid process. Therefore, we do expect\nto have circumstellar, interplanetary, and cometary dust aligned. Particular\ninteresting in this respect are T-Tauri accretion disks (see Cho & Lazarian\n2006). Tracing magnetic fields in these environments with aligned grains opens\nnew exciting avenues for polarimetry.\nTaken a broader view, grain alignment is a part of a wider range of alignment\nastrophysical processes that can provide the information about magnetic fields.\nMolecules aligned in their excited states can trace magnetic field (Goldreich\n& Kylafis 1982), the effect that was first successfully used in Girart, Crutcher\n& Rao (1999) to map magnetic field in molecular clouds. Atoms and ions\nwith fine and hyperfine structure can be aligned by radiation in their ground\nor metastable states. The magnetic field then mixes up the states due to\nthe Larmor precession, which allows studies of interstellar and circumstellar\nmagnetic fields via absorption and emission lines (Yan & Lazarian 2006ab) 1 .\nMaking use of several alignment processes is another avenue for observational\nstudies of astrophysical magnetic fields (see Lazarian & Yan 2005).\nGetting back to dust, one should mention that in the past the linear starlight\npolarimetry was used. These days, far infrared polarimetry of dust emission\nhas become a major source of magnetic field structure data in molecular clouds\n(see Hildebrand 2000). It is likely that the circular polarimetry may become\nan important means of probing magnetic fields in circumstellar regions and\ncomets.\nIn this review I shall show that the modern grain alignment theory allows us\nfor the first time ever make quantitative predictions of the polarization degree\nfrom various astrophysical objects. A substantial part of the review is devoted\nto the physics of grain alignment, which is deep and exciting. Enough to say,\nits progress resulted in a discovery of a number of new solid state physics\neffects. The rich physics of grain alignment presents a problem, however, for\nits presentation. Therefore I shall describe first the genesis of ideas that form\nthe basis of the present-day grain alignment theory. The references to the\noriginal papers should help the interested reader to get the in-depth coverage\nof the topic. Earlier reviews on the subject include Lazarian (2003), Roberge\n(2004), Lazarian & Cho (2005) and Vaillancourt (2006). Progress in testing\ntheory is addressed in Hildebrand et al. (2000), while the exciting aspects of\ngrain dynamics are covered in Lazarian & Yan (2004).\nBelow, in \u00a72 I shall show how the properties of polarized radiation are related\nto the statistics of aligned grains. In \u00a73 I shall discuss the essential elements of\ngrain dynamics. In \u00a74 I shall analyze the main alignment mechanisms. In \u00a75 I\nshall compare the mechanisms and discuss new processes related to subsonic\n1\n\nThose studies potentially can restore 3D direction of magnetic fields, compared\nto the plane-of-sky projection of magnetic field available via dust polarimetry.\n\n3\n\n\fmechanical alignment of irregular grains. In \u00a76, I shall discuss the observational\ndata that put the grain-alignment theory to test. An outlook on the prospects\nof the polarimetric studies of magnetic fields will be presented in \u00a77.\n\n2\n\nAligned Grains & Polarized Radiation\n\nA practical interest in aligned grains arises from the fact that their alignment\nresults in polarization of the extinct starlight as well as in polarization in grain\nemission. Below we discuss why this happens.\n\n2.1 Linear Polarized Starlight from Aligned Grains\nFor an ensemble of aligned grains the degrees of extinction in the directions\nperpendicular and parallel to the direction of alignment are different 2 . Therefore initially unpolarized starlight acquires polarization while passing through\na volume with aligned grains (see Fig. 2a). If the extinction in the direction\nof alignment is \u03c4k and in the perpendicular direction is \u03c4\u22a5 one can write the\npolarization, Pabs , by selective extinction of grains as\nPabs =\n\ne\u2212\u03c4k \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4\u22a5\n\u2248 \u2212(\u03c4k \u2212 \u03c4\u22a5 )/2 ,\ne\u2212\u03c4k + e\u2212\u03c4\u22a5\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the latter approximation is valid for \u03c4k \u2212\u03c4\u22a5 \u226a 1. To relate the difference\nof extinctions to the properties of aligned grains one can take into account the\nfact that the extinction is proportional to the product of the grain density\nand their cross sections. If a cloud is composed of identical aligned grains \u03c4k\nand \u03c4\u22a5 are proportional to the number of grains along the light path times\nthe corresponding cross sections, which are, respectively, Ck and C\u22a5 .\nIn reality one has to consider additional complications (like, say, incomplete\ngrain alignment) and variations in the direction of the alignment axis relative to the line of sight. (In most cases the alignment axis coincides with\nthe direction of magnetic field.) To obtain an adequate description, one can\n(see Roberge & Lazarian 1999) consider an electromagnetic wave propagating\nalong the line of sight (the \u1e91o axis, as on Fig. 1b). The transfer equations\nfor the Stokes parameters depend on the cross sections Cxo and Cyo for linearly polarized waves with the electric vector, E, along the x\u0302o and \u0177o axes\nperpendicular to \u1e91o (Lee & Draine 1985).\n2\n\nAccording to Hildebrand & Dragovan (1995), the best fit of the grain properties\ncorresponds to oblate grains with the ratio of axis about 2/3.\n\n4\n\n\fB\ny^o\n\u03b6\n\nx^ o\n^\nzo\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\nFig. 1. (a)Left panel\u2013 Alignment of grains implies several alignment processes acting\nsimultaneously and covering various timescales. Internal alignment was introduced\nby Purcell (1979) and was assumed to be a slow process. Lazarian & Draine (1999a)\nshowed that the internal alignment is 106 times faster if nuclear spins are accounted\nfor. The time scale of J and B alignment is given for diffuse interstellar medium. It\nis faster in circumstellar regions and for cometary dust. (b) Right panel\u2013 Geometry\nof observations (after Roberge & Lazarian 1999).\n\nTo calculate Cxo and Cyo , one transforms the components of E to the principal axes of the grain, and takes the appropriately-weighted sum of the cross\nsections Ck and C\u22a5 for E polarized along the grain axes (Fig 1b illustrates\nthe geometry of observations). When the transformation is carried out and the\nresulting expressions are averaged over the precession angles, one finds (see\ntransformations in Lee & Draine 1985 for spheroidal grains, and in Efroimsky\n2002a for the general case) that the mean cross sections are\nCxo = Cavg +\n\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nR C\u22a5 \u2212 Ck 1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b6\n3\n\nCyo = Cavg +\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nR C\u22a5 \u2212 Ck\n3\n\n,\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b6 being\u0010the angle \u0011between the polarization axis and the x\u0302o \u0177o plane, and\nCavg \u2261 2C\u22a5 + Ck /3 being the effective cross section for randomly-oriented\ngrains. To characterize the alignment, we used in eq. (3) the Rayleigh reduction\nfactor (Greenberg 1968) defined as\nR \u2261 hG(cos2 \u03b8)G(cos2 \u03b2)i ,\n\n(4)\n5\n\n\fwhere angular brackets denote ensemble averaging, G(x) \u2261 3/2(x \u2212 1/3), \u03b8\nis the angle between the axis of the largest moment of inertia (henceforth\nthe axis of maximal inertia) and the magnetic field B, while \u03b2 is the angle\nbetween the angular momentum J and B. To characterize the alignment with\nrespect to the magnetic field, the measures QX \u2261 hG(\u03b8)i and QJ \u2261 hG(\u03b2)i are\nemployed. Unfortunately, these statistics are not independent and therefore R\nis not equal to QJ QX (see Lazarian 1998, Roberge & Lazarian 1999). This\nconsiderably complicates the description of the alignment process.\n2.2 Polarized Emission from Aligned Grains\nAligned grains emit polarized radiation (see Fig. 2b). The difference in \u03c4k and\n\u03c4\u22a5 for aligned dust results in the emission polarization:\nPem =\n\n\u03c4k \u2212 \u03c4\u22a5\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4k ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4\u22a5 )\n,\n\u2248\n\u2212\u03c4k\n\u2212\u03c4\n(1 \u2212 e ) + (1 \u2212 e \u22a5 )\n\u03c4k + \u03c4\u22a5\n\n(5)\n\nwhere both optical depths \u03c4 k are \u03c4\u22a5 were assumed to be small. Taking into account that both Pem and Pabs are functions of the wavelength \u03bb and combining\neqs.(1) and (6), one obtains for \u03c4 = (\u03c4k + \u03c4\u22a5 )/2\nPem (\u03bb) \u2248 \u2212Pabs (\u03bb)/\u03c4 (\u03bb) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhich establishes the relation between the polarizations in emission and absorption. The minus sign in eq (6) reflects the fact that emission and absorption polarizations are orthogonal. This relation enables one to predict the far\ninfrared polarization of emitted light if the starlight polarization is measured.\nThis opens interesting prospects of predicting the foreground polarization arising from emitting dust using the starlight polarization measurements (Cho &\nLazarian 2002, 2003). As Pabs depends on R, Pem also depends on the Rayleigh\nreduction factor.\n2.3 Circular Polarization from Aligned Grains\nOne way of obtaining circular polarization is to have a magnetic field that\nvaries along the line of sight (Martin 1972). Passing through one cloud with\naligned dust the light becomes partially linearly polarized. On passing the\nsecond cloud with dust gets aligned in a different direction. Hence, the light\ngets circular polarization. Literature study shows that this effect is well remembered (see Menard et al 1988), while another process entailing circular\npolarization is frequently forgotten. We mean the process of single scattering\n6\n\n\fFig. 2. (a)Left panel\u2013 Polarization of starlight passing through a cloud of aligned\ndust grains. The direction of polarization (E) is parallel to the plane of the sky\ndirection of magnetic field. (b) Right panel\u2013 Polarization of radiation from a optically\nthin cloud of aligned dust grains. The direction of polarization (E) is perpendicular\nto the plane of the sky direction of magnetic field.\n\nof light on aligned particles. An electromagnetic wave interacting with a single grain coherently excites dipoles parallel and perpendicular to the grain's\nlong axis. In the presence of adsorption, these dipoles get phase shift, thus\ngiving rise to circular polarization. This polarization can be observed from an\nensemble of grains if these are aligned. The intensity of circularly polarized\ncomponent of radiation emerging via scattering of radiation with k wavenumber on small (a \u226a \u03bb) spheroidal particles is (Schmidt 1972)\nV (e, e0 , e1 ) =\n\nI0 k 4\n\u2217\ni(\u03b1k \u03b1\u22a5\n\u2212 \u03b1k\u2217 \u03b1\u22a5 ) ([e0 \u00d7 e1 ]e) (e0 e) ,\n2r 2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere e0 and e1 are the unit vectors in the directions of incident and scattered\nradiation, e is the direction along the aligned axes of spheroids; \u03b1\u22a5 and \u03b1k are\nthe particle polarizabilities along e and perpendicular to it.\nThe intensity of the circularly polarized radiation scattered in the volume\n\u2206\u0393(d, r) at |d| from the star at a distance |r| from the observer is (Dolginov\n& Mytrophanov 1978)\n\u2206V (d, r) =\n\nL\u22c6 ndust \u03c3V\nR ([d \u00d7 r]h) (dr)\u2206\u0393(d, r) ,\n6\u03c0|d|4 |r||d \u2212 r|2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere L\u22c6 is the stellar luminosity, ndust is the number of dust grains per a\nunit volume, and \u03c3V is the cross section for producing circular polarization,\n\u2217\nwhich for small grains is \u03c3V = i/(2k 4 )(\u03b1k \u03b1\u22a5\n\u2212 \u03b1k\u2217 \u03b1\u22a5 ). According to Dolginov & Mytrophanov (1978) circular polarization arising from single scattering\non aligned grains can be as high as several percent for metallic or graphite\n7\n\n\fparticles, which is much more than one may expect from varying magnetic\nfield direction along the line of sight (Martin 1971). In the latter case, the\nlinear polarization produced by one layer of aligned grains passes through\nanother layer where alignment direction is different. If on passing through a\nsingle layer, the linear polarization degree is p, then passing through two layers\nproduces circular polarization that does not exceed p2 .\n\n3\n\nGrain Dynamics: Never Ending Story\n\nGrain dynamics is really rich, as it involves an abundant variety of effects. We\nprovide a brief over-review of this exciting field of research.\n\n3.1 Wobbling Grains\nTo produce the observed starlight polarization, grains must be aligned, with\ntheir long axes perpendicular to magnetic field. According to eq. (4) this involves alignment not only of the grains' angular momenta J with respect to the\nexternal magnetic field B, but also the alignment of the grains' long axes with\nrespect to J. Jones & Spitzer (1967) assumed a Maxwellian distribution of the\nangular momentum, distribution that favored the preferential alignment of J\nwith the axis of a maximal moment of inertia (henceforth, maximal inertia,\nusing Purcell's terminology). As we already mentioned in \u00a73.2, Purcell (1979,\nhenceforth P79) later considered grains rotating much faster than the thermal\nvelocities and showed that the internal dissipation of energy in a grain will\nmake grains spin about the axis of maximal inertia.\nIndeed, it is intuitively clear that a tumbling and precessing grain should, due\nto the internal dissipation, tend to get into the state of minimal energy, i.e., to\nspin about the axis of maximal inertia. P79 discussed two possible causes of\ninternal dissipation \u2013 one due to the well known inelastic relaxation (see also\nLazarian & Efroimsky 1999), another due to the mechanism that he discovered\nand termed \"Barnett relaxation\".\nWe would remind to the reader that the Barnett effect is inverse to the\nEinstein-de Haas effect. The essence of the Einstein-de Haas effect is that\na paramagnetic body acquires rotation during remagnetizations, when the\nflipping electrons transfer to the lattice their spin angular momentum. The\nessence of the Barnett effect is that the rotating body shares its angular\nmomentum with the electron subsystem, thus causing magnetization. The\nmagnetization is directed along the grain's angular velocity, and the value of\nthe Barnett-induced magnetic moment is \u03bc \u2248 10\u221219 \u03a9(5) erg gauss\u22121 (where\n8\n\n\fFig. 3.

Also shown the \"crossover time\" tc = J/J \u0307k , where\nthe torques are due to the H2 formation, with a density of active sites 1013 cm\u22122 .\nFrom Lazarian & Draine (1999a).\n\n\u03a9(5) \u2261 \u03a9(s\u22121 )/105 ) 3 .\nInto the grain-alignment theory, the Barnett effect was introduced by Dolginov\n& Mytrophanov (1976), who noticed that the magnetization of rotating grains\ndue to this effect far exceeds the one arising from their typical charge. By\nitself, this was a big advance in understanding the grain dynamics. Moreover,\nit induced Purcell to think about the relaxation that this magnetization could\ncause.\nThe Barnett relaxation process may be easily understood. We know that a\nfreely rotating grain preserves the direction of J, while the (body-axes-related)\nangular velocity precesses about J (see Fig. 3a). The \"Barnett equivalent magnetic field\", i.e. the equivalent external magnetic field that would cause the\nsame magnetization of the grain material, is HBE = 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03a9(5) G. Due\nto the precession of the angular velocity, the co-directed \"Barnett equivalent\nmagnetic field\" precesses in the grain axes. This causes remagnetization accompanied by the inevitable dissipation.\nThe Barnett relaxation takes place over the time scale of tBar \u2248 4\u00d7107 \u03a9\u22122\n(5) sec,\nwhich is very short compared to the time tgas over which randomization\nthrough gas-grain collisions takes place. As a result, models of interstellardust polarization developed since 1979 have often assumed that the Barnett\nTherefore the Larmor precession has a period \u03c4L \u223c 106 B5\u22121 s (where B5 \u2261\nB/(10\u22125 G)), and the magnetic field defines the axis of alignment (see also \u00a75.4)\n3\n\n9\n\n\fdissipation aligns J perfectly with the major axis of inertia. However, Lazarian\n(1994, henceforth L94) showed that this approximation is invalid if the grains\nrotate with thermal kinetic energies: thermal fluctuations in the Barnett magnetization will excite rotation about all 3 of the body axes, preventing perfect\nalignment unless either the rotation velocity is suprathermal (\u03a9 \u226b \u03a9thermal )\nor the grain's material temperature is zero.\nFollowing Lazarian & Roberge (1997, henceforth LR97), consider an oblate\ngrain (see Fig. 3a) with an angular momentum J. Its energy can be written\nas\n\u0011\nJ2 \u0010\nE(\u03b2) =\n1 + sin2 \u03b2(h \u2212 1)\nIk\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere h = Ik /I\u22a5 is the ratio of the maximal to minimal moments of grain inertia. Internal forces cannot change the angular momentum, but it is evident\nfrom eq.(9) that the energy can be decreased by aligning the axis of maximal\ninertia along J, i.e. by decreasing \u03b2. However, whatever the efficiency of internal relaxation, in the presence of thermal fluctuations the grain energy as a\nfunction of \u03b2 should have a Boltzmann distribution, i.e. exp(\u2212E(\u03b2)/kTgrain ),\nwhere Tgrain is the grain temperature, rather than the \u03b4-function distribution\nassumed in the literature thitherto. The quantitative analysis offered in LR97\nallowed many further theoretical advances.\nAs the numbers of parallel and antiparallel spins become different, the body\ndevelops magnetization, even if the unpaired spins are nuclear spins. The relation between \u03a9 and the strength of the \"Barnett-equivalent\" magnetic field\n(n)\nHBE (P79) that would cause the same nuclear magnetization (in a non-rotating\nbody) is given by\n(n)\n\nHBE =\n\n~ ~\n\u03a9 ,\ngn \u03bcN\n\n(10)\n\nwhere gn is the so-called nuclear g-factor (see Morrish 1980), and \u03bcN \u2261\ne~/2mp c is the nuclear magneton, which is equal to the Bohr magneton multiplied by the electron to proton mass ratio, me /mp .\nThe nuclear magnetization was mentioned in P79 as an subdominant effect\nthat can induce Larmor precession. The same paper discussed the Barnett\nrelaxation, but did not address a possible effect of the nuclear spins on the\ninternal relaxation. Presumably, this was due to the fact that the nuclear\nmoments induce the magnetization of grains that is me /mp smaller that the\nmagnetization by electrons.\nThe nuclear relaxation was considered by Lazarian & Draine (1999a, further on\n10\n\n\fLD99a). Surprisingly and rather counter-intuitively, the effect happened to be\nvery strong. Indeed, a striking feature of eq. (10) is that the Barnett-equivalent\nmagnetic field is inversely proportional to the species' magnetic moment. As\ngrain tumbles, the magnetization changes in the grain's body coordinates,\nand this causes paramagnetic relaxation. This relaxation is proportional to\n2\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032N (\u03a9)HBE\n(where \u03c7\u2032\u2032N is the imaginary part of the nuclear contribution to\nthe susceptibility) and is approximately 106 times faster for nuclear moments\nthan for their electron counterparts (see Fig. 3b).\nIn terms of parameters involved, our arguments may be summarized as follows.\nThe Barnett equivalent field HBE is \u223c 1/\u03bc, while the paramagnetic relaxation\n2\nis proportional (for sufficiently slow rotation) to HBE\n, which means that the\n2\nrelaxation rate is proportional to 1/\u03bc . As \u03bc \u223c 1/m, the heavier the species\n~ the higher the relaxation rate.\nto align along \u03a9\nCuriously enough, while the Barnett effect is reduced for nuclear spins by\na factor of \u223c me /mp , the relaxation increases by a factor of \u223c (mp /me )2 .\nTherefore it would be incorrect to identify this relaxation as a modification of\nthe Barnett relaxation for nuclear spins. This is a separate relaxation process.\nIn terms of its domain of applicability it is limited by the spin-spin relaxation\nrate. Indeed, the nuclear spins precess in the field of their neighbors, which is\napproximately \u223c 3.8nn \u03bcn (van Vleck 1937), where \u03bcn is the magnetic moment\nof the nuclei, nn is the density of the nuclei. For hydrogen nuclei \u03bcn \u2248 2.7\u03bcN ,\nfor 29 Si \u03bcn \u2248 0.5\u03bcN (see Robinson 1991). The rate of precession in such a\n\u22121\nfield is \u03c4nn\n\u223c ~/(3.8gnnn \u03bcn ), where gn is the nuclear g-factor, which is, for\ninstance, \u223c \u22120.6 for 29 Si. According to LD99a the interaction of nuclei in the\n\u22121\ninterstellar grains with electrons induce a nuclei-electron relaxation rate \u03c4ne\n\u22121\nwhich is comparable with \u03c4nn\nand the actual spin-spin relaxation rate \u03c4n\u22121 is\nthe sum of the two. If grain rotational frequency \u03c9 exceeds the rate of spinspin relaxation, the internal nuclear dissipation rate t\u22121\nnucl gets suppressed by a\n2\nfactor [1+(\u03c9\u03c4n ) ] (Draine & Lazarian 1998b). This explains why for small fast\nrotating grains the Barnett relaxation may be more efficient than the nuclear\none (see Fig. 3).\nHowever, the nuclear relaxation dominates the Barnett one for grains larger\nthan 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm, the range that includes most of the aligned interstellar\ngrains. In general, for several relaxation processes acting simultaneously, the\n\u22121\noverall internal relaxation rate is t\u22121\nrelax,tot = \u03a3trelax,i .\n\n3.2 Grains that are Swiftly Rotating, Flipping, and Thermally Trapped\n\nAll the studies undertaken prior to 1979, with a notable exception of Dolginov\n& Mytrophanov (1976) that we shall discuss separately, assumed the Brownian\n11\n\n\fJ\n\nJ\n\nSpin\u2212down\n\n\u03b2\n\nJ\n\nbefore\nflipover\nJ\n\nTorques decrease J\n\nPurcell thruster\nJ=Jmin\n\nMinimal J\n(flip)\n\nafter\nflipover\nJ\n\u03b2\n\nSpin\u2212up\nTorques\nincrease J\n\nFig. 4.

(b) Right panel\u2013 A regular crossover event as described by\nSpitzer & McGlynn (1979). The systematic torques nullify the amplitude of the\nJ component parallel to the axis of maximal inertia, while preserving the other\ncomponent, J\u22a5 . If J\u22a5 is small then the grain is susceptible to randomization during\ncrossovers. The direction of J is preserved in the absence of random bombardment.\n\ngrain rotation with the effective temperature equal to the mean of the grain\nand gas temperatures (see Jones & Spitzer 1967). The greater complexity of\ngrain rotation was appreciated only later. Purcell (1975; 1979) realized that\ngrains may rotate at a much faster rate resulting from systematic torques.\nP79 identified three separate systematic torque mechanisms: inelastic scattering of impinging atoms when gas and grain temperatures differ, photoelectric\nemission, and H2 formation on grain surfaces (see Fig. 4a). Below we shall\nrefer to the latter as \"Purcell's torques\". These were shown to dominate the\nother two for typical conditions in the diffuse ISM (P79). The existence of\nsystematic H2 torques is expected due to the random distribution over the\ngrain surface of catalytic sites of H2 formation, since each active site acts as a\nminute thruster emitting newly-formed H2 molecules. The arguments of P79\nin favor of suprathermal rotation were so clear and compelling that other researchers were immediately convinced that the interstellar granules in diffuse\nclouds must rotate suprathermally.\nP79 considered changes of the grain surface properties and noted that those\nshould stochastically change the direction (in body-coordinates) of the systematic torques. Spitzer & McGlynn (1979, henceforth SM79) developed a\ntheory of such crossovers. During a crossover, the grain slows down, flips, and\nthereafter is accelerated again (see Fig. 4b).\nFrom the viewpoint of the grain-alignment theory, the important question is\nwhether or not a grain gets randomized during a crossover. If the value of the\n12\n\n\fangular momentum is small during the crossover, the grains are susceptible to\nrandomization arising from atomic bombardment. The original calculations in\nSM79 obtained only marginal correlation between the values of the angular\nmomentum before and after a crossover, but their analysis disregarded thermal\nfluctuations within the grain material. Indeed, if the alignment of J with\nthe axis of maximal inertia is perfect, all the time through the crossover the\nabsolute value of |J| passes through zero during the crossover. Therefore gas\ncollisions and recoils from nascent H2 molecules would completely randomize\nthe final direction of J during the crossover. Thermal fluctuations partially\ndecouple J from the axis of maximal inertia (see \u00a73.1). As a result, the minimal\nvalue of |J| during a crossover is equal to the component of J perpendicular\nto the axis of maximal inertia. This value for moderately oblate grains is\napproximately Jd \u2248 (2kTdust Ik )1/2 , and the randomization during a crossover\ndecreases (Lazarian & Draine 1997, henceforth LD97). LD97 obtained a high\ndegree of correlation between the angular-momentum directions before and\nafter the crossover for grains larger than the critical radius ac,Bar \u2248 1.5 \u00d7\n10\u22125 cm. This is the radius for which the time for internal dissipation of the\nrotational kinetic energy is equal to the duration of a crossover.\nAs nuclear relaxation is faster than the Barnett one for grains larger than\n5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm (see Fig. 3), the actual grain critical size ac gets larger than\n10\u22124 cm. In view of this, the results of LD97 study are related only to very\nlarge grains, e.g. grains inside molecular clouds or accretion disks.\nWhat would happen for grains that are smaller than ac ? The SM79 theory\nprescribed that the granules should follow the phase-space trajectory along\nwhich J\u22a5 is approximately constant while the component of J parallel to the\naxis of maximal inertia Jk changes sign. Later, though, Lazarian & Draine\n(1999b, henceforth LD99b) demonstrated that in reality the grains undergo\nflipovers (see Fig. 5a) during which the absolute value J does not change. If\nthese flipovers repeat, the grains get \"thermally trapped\" (LD99b and Fig. 5b).\nThis process can be understood in the following way. For sufficiently small |J|,\nthe rate of flipping t\u22121\ntf becomes large. Purcell's torques change sign as grain\nflips, and they cannot efficiently spin the grain up. As a result, a substantial\npart of grains smaller than acr cannot rotate at high rates predicted by P79,\neven in spite of the presence of systematic torques that are fixed in the body\naxes (LD99a). A more elaborate study of the phenomenon in Roberge & Ford\n(preprint; see also Roberge 2004) supports this conclusion.\nWhile the thermal trapping limits the range of grain sizes which can be spun\nup by Purcell's torques, a natural question arises: do the astrophysical grains\nrotate suprathermally?\nEarlier than Purcell, Dolginov (1972) and Dolginov & Mytrophanov (1976)\nidentified radiative torques as the way of spinning up a subset of the inter13\n\n\frm\nthe\n\nal\n\nflip\n\ns\n\nJ\nspin-down\n\nJ\n\u03b2\n\nspin-up\n\nJ\n\nFig. 5.

Unlike Harwit (1971), who addressed the issue of interaction of\nsymmetric, e.g. spheroidal, grains with a radiative flow, Dolginov and Mytrophanov considered \"twisted grains\" that can be characterized by some helicity.\nThey noticed that \"helical\" grains would scatter differently the left- and rightpolarized light, for which reason an ordinary unpolarized light would spin them\nup. The subset of the \"helical\" grains was not properly identified, and the later\nresearchers could assume that it is limited to special shapes/materials. One\nway or another, this ground-breaking work did not make much impact to the\nfield until Draine & Weingartner (1996, henceforth DW96) numerically showed\nthat grains of rather arbitrary irregular shapes get spun up efficiently.\nDW96 and Draine & Weingartner (1997, henceforth DW97) demonstrated\nthat radiative torques can be separated into isotropic and anisotropic parts.\nWhile the isotropic torques that are fixed in body coordinates are averaged\nout similarly to the Purcell torques, the anisotropic torques do not change sign\nwhen the grain flips. If those spin-up grains are fast enough to avoid constant\nflipping, the Purcell torques can also act on a grain in a regular way. Do all\ngrains get spun up efficiently by anisotropic radiative torques? While DW97\nprovide arguments in favor of the positive answer, it should be mentioned\nthat they treated crossovers in a crude way, i.e., as singularities at which the\ngrain does not flip, while the direction of J changes to the opposite one. This\n14\n\n\fis different from the crossover prescriptions in SM79 and Lazarian & Draine\n(1997). On the contrary, the study in Weingartner & Draine (2003, henceforth\nWD03), that accounted for thermal wobbling of grains (LR97, LD99b), indicated that only a fraction of grains rotates suprathermally when acted upon\nby anisotropic radiative torques. Lazarian & Hoang (2006, henceforth LH07)\nshowed that the same effect is also present when thermal wobbling is absent,\nbut a more rigorous treatment of crossovers is applied. In fact, LH06 showed\nthat at Tgrain \u2192 0 and no gaseous bombardment most grains undergo multiple\ncrossovers and get settled with J \u2192 0. For finite Tgrain , the same subset of\ngrains settles with J \u223c Jd in accordance with the findings in WD03. The effective temperature of grain rotation increases to approximately Tgas > Tgrain\nwhen gaseous bombardment is present (Hoang & Lazarian 2007).\nThis presents an unexpected twist in the theory of radiative torques. Interestingly enough, for most grains their alignment by radiative torques is a way\nto minimize their rotational velocity. Therefore most grains in the diffuse interstellar gas, contrary to the common belief, do not rotate suprathermally. In\naddition, essentially none of the small grains (i.e. ones with a < 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm),\nrotate suprathermally as the radiative torques are too weak to spun up the\ngrains of size much less than the wavelength 4 . On the contrary, grains deep\nwithin starless molecular clouds were usually assumed to rotate thermally.\nHowever, Cho & Lazarian (2005) showed that the radiative torques efficiency\nincreases with the grain size. Therefore some fraction of large grains will rotate\nsuprathermally even in dark cores of molecular clouds. As we explain further,\nrapid rotation is not a necessary requirement for the efficient alignment, if\nradiative torques are concerned.\n3.3 Grains Zooming in Space\nGrains can stream through ambient gas. One of the processes to induce such\nstreaming was suggested by Gold (1952) who considered penetration of grains\nfrom one cloud to another as the clouds collide. Later, though, Davis (1955)\nshowed that the applicability realm of the process is quite limited.\nA more standard way of driving grain-gas motion is by radiation pressure (see\nPurcell 1969). Grains are exposed to various forces in anisotropic radiation\nfields. Apart from radiation pressure, grains are subjected to forces due to the\nasymmetric photon-stimulated ejection of electrons. A detailed discussion can\nbe found in Weingartner & Draine (2001). They demonstrated that the emission caused force is comparable to the one arising from the usual radiation\npressure, provided that the grain potential is low and the radiation spectrum\nis hard. Another photon-stimulated ejection process showing up in the picture\n4\n\nIn the vicinity of stars with UV excess smaller grains can be spun up as well.\n\n15\n\n\fis photodesorption of atoms absorbed on grain surface. The force due to photodesorption of atoms is comparable to the radiation and photoelectric ones\n(Draine 2003). However, none of these forces is expected to induce a supersonic\ngrain drift under the typical interstellar conditions.\nA residual imbalance arises from the difference of the number of catalytic\nactive sites for H2 formation on upper and lower grain surfaces (P79). The\nnascent H2 molecules leave the active sites with kinetic energy E, and the\ngrain experiences a push in the opposite direction. The uncompensated force\nis parallel to the spin direction as the other components of force are averaged out due to the grain's fast rotation. Applying the best-guess values 5 adopted in LD97, Lazarian & Yan (2002) got the \"optimistic\" velocity v \u2243 330(10\u22125cm/a)1/2 cm/s for the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and\nv \u2243 370(10\u22125cm/a)0.7 cm/s for the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM), provided\nthat grains do not flip (see \u00a73.2). In dark clouds, a similar effect arising from\nvariations of the accommodation coefficient can induce translational motion\nof grains.\nTurbulence is another driver for grain drift with respect to gas. It is generally\naccepted that the interstellar medium is turbulent (see Elmegreen & Scalo\n2002). Turbulence has been invoked by a number of authors (see Weidenschilling & Ruzmaikina 1994, Lazarian & Yan 2002 and references therein)\nto induce grain motion relative to the gas. In hydrodynamic turbulence, the\ngrain motions are caused by the frictional interaction with the gas. At large\nscales, grains are coupled with the ambient gas, and the fluctuating gas motions mostly cause an overall advection of the grains with the gas (Draine\n1985). At small scales, grains are decoupled. The largest velocity difference\noccurs on the largest scale at which the grains are still decoupled. Thus the\ncharacteristic velocity of a grain with respect to the gas corresponds to the velocity dispersion of the turbulence on the scales corresponding to eddies with\nturnover time equal to tdrag (Draine & Salpeter 1979). Using the Kolmogorov\nscaling relation vk \u221d k \u22121/3 , Draine (1985) obtained the largest velocity dispersion in hydrodynamic turbulence v \u2243 V (tdrag /\u03c4max )1/2 , where \u03c4max is the\neddy turnover time at the injection scale.\nA complication, though, comes from the fact that most astrophysical fluids\nare magnetized. Therefore magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence should\nbe used to characterize interstellar turbulence. This was attempted first in\nL94. A more quantitative approach was adopted in Lazarian & Yan (2002)\nand Yan & Lazarian (2003, henceforth YL03). There, in accordance with the\nsimulations in Cho & Lazarian (2002), the MHD turbulence was decomposed\n5\n\nThe number of H2 formation sites is highly uncertain.

Moreover, in YL03\nwe considered a gyro-resonance between the fluctuating magnetic field and\ncharged grains, and thus identified a new mechanism of grain acceleration.\nSpecifically, the resonance condition that the Doppler-shifted frequency of the\nwave in the grain's guiding center rest frame \u03c9gc = \u03c9\u2212kk v\u03bc is a multiple of the\nparticle gyrofrequency \u03a9g : \u03c9 \u2212 kk v\u03bc = n\u03a9g , (n = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12...). Basically, there\nare two main types of resonant interactions: gyroresonance acceleration and\nthe transit one. The transit acceleration (n = 0) requires longitudinal motions\nthat are present only for compressible modes. As the dispersion relation for\nfast waves is \u03c9 = kVf > kVA , it is clear that it is applicable only to the superAlfvenic (for a low \u03b2 medium, i.e. with magnetic pressure higher than the\nthermal one, as \u03b2 \u2261 Pgas /Pmag ) or supersonic (for a high \u03b2 medium) grains.\nFor low speed grains that we deal with, gyroresonance is the dominant MHD\ninteraction. The calculation by YL03 showed that grains gain the maximum\nvelocities perpendicular to the magnetic field, so the averaged \u03bc decreases. This\nis understandable since the electric field accelerating the grain is perpendicular\nto the magnetic field.\nThe results of the theory were applied to various idealized phases of the interstellar medium in Yan, Lazarian & Draine (2004). In Fig. 6, we show the\nvelocity of grain as a function of the grain size in CNM.\nThe acceleration by gyroresonance in both MC and DC are not so efficient\nas in other media. This happens in MC and DC because the time for the\ngyroresonant acceleration, tdrag , are much shorter that in the WNM. In MC\n17\n\n\fand DC, due to high density, the drag time is less than the gyro-period for\ngrains larger than 10\u22125 cm.\nFor molecular clouds Roberge & Hanany (1990) and Roberge, Hanany &\nMessinger (1995) considered ambipolar diffusion 6 . They demonstrated that\nthis diffusion entails supersonic relative drift. The action of the mechanism is\nexpected to be localized, however.\nTo finish our brief discussion of grain motion in magnetized medium consider\nmagnetized shocks. The basic idea is that the weakly charged grains are like\nions with high mass to charge ratio (Epstein 1980). Thus they can easily diffuse farther back upstream of the shock and be accelerated more efficiently\nto suprathermal energies. Nevertheless, the shock acceleration is inefficient for\nlow speed grains. The reason for this is that the efficiency of the shock acceleration depends on the scattering rate, which is determined by the stochastic\ninteraction with the turbulence. For low speed particles, the scattering rate\nis lower than the rate of momentum diffusion. In this case, the stochastic\nacceleration by turbulence happens faster than dust acceleration by shocks\n(YL03).\n\n4\n\nGrain Alignment Theory: Major Mechanisms\n\n4.1 Tough Problem\nWe have seen in the previous sections that both linear and circular polarizations depend on the degree of grain alignment given by the Rayleigh reduction\nfactor (see Eq. (4)). Therefore it is the goal of the grain alignment theory to\ndetermine this factor. Table 1 shows that the wide range of different time\nscales involved makes the brute force numerical approach doomed.\nA number of different mechanisms that produce grain alignment has been\ndeveloped by now. Dealing with a particular situation one has to identify the\ndominant alignment process. Therefore it is essential to understand different\nmechanisms.\nThe history of grain alignment is really exciting. A real constellation of illustrious scholars, e.g. L. Spitzer and E. Purcell contributed to the field. Our\nearlier discussion of the complex dynamics of a grain explains why the grain\nalignment theory still requires theoretical efforts. Note, that most of the effects\n6\n\nA similar process was considered by Roberge & Desch (1990) for molecular accretion disks.\n\n18\n\n\fwe discussed in the previous section were discovered in the process of work on\ngrain alignment.\nA drama of ideas in historic perspective is presented in Lazarian (2003). It\nwas shown there that the work on grain alignment can be subdivided into a\nnumber stages, such that at the end of each the researchers believed that the\ntheory was adequate. However, higher quality observational data made it clear\nthat more work was required.\n\n4.2 Paramagnetic Alignment\nThe Davis-Greenstein (1951) mechanism (henceforth D-G mechanism) is based\non the paramagnetic dissipation that is experienced by a rotating grain. Paramagnetic materials contain unpaired electrons that get oriented by the interstellar magnetic field B. The orientation of spins causes grain magnetization\nand the latter varies as the vector of magnetization rotates in the grain body\ncoordinates. This causes paramagnetic loses at the expense of the grain ro~ is parallel\ntation energy. Be mindful, that if the grain rotational velocity \u03a9\nto B, the grain magnetization does not change with time and therefore no\ndissipation takes place. Thus the paramagnetic dissipation acts to decrease\n~ perpendicular to B and one may expect that eventually\nthe component of \u03a9\n~\ngrains will tend to rotate with \u03a9kB\nprovided that the time of relaxation tD\u2212G\nis much shorter than the time of randomization through chaotic gaseous bombardment, tgas . In practice, the last condition is difficult to satisfy. It is clear\nfrom Table 1 that for 10\u22125 cm grains in the diffuse interstellar medium, tD\u2212G\n\u22121/2\n\u22122\nis of the order of 1013 a2(\u22125) s2 B(5)\ns , while tgas is 5 \u00d7 1012 n(20) T(2) a(\u22125) s if\nmagnetic field is 10\u22125 G and temperature and density of gas are 100 K and\n20 cm\u22123 , respectively.\nThe first detailed analytical treatment of the problem of D-G alignment was\ngiven by Jones & Spitzer (1967) who described the alignment of J using the\nFokker-Planck equation. This approach allowed them to account for magnetization fluctuations within the grain material, and thus provided a more\naccurate picture of the J alignment. The first numerical treatment of D-G\nalignment was presented by Purcell (1969). By that time, it became clear\nthat the original D-G mechanism is too weak to explain the observed grain\nalignment. However, Jones & Spitzer (1967) noticed that if interstellar grains\ncontain superparamagnetic, ferro- or ferrimagnetic inclusions 7 , the tD\u2212G may\nbe reduced by orders of magnitude. Since 10% of atoms in interstellar dust\nare iron, the formation of magnetic clusters in grains was not far fetched (see\n7\n\nThe evidence for such inclusions was found much later through the study of\ninterstellar dust particles captured in the atmosphere (Bradley 1994).\n\n19\n\n\fTable 1\nTime-scales relevant for grain alignment\n\nSymbol\n\nMeaning\n\nDefinition\n\ntrot\n\nthermal rotational period\n\ntBar\n\nBarnett relaxation time\n\n\u22121/2 5/2\n\n6 \u00d7 10\u22125 T\u0302rot a\u22125 s\u22122\n\n2\u03c0/\u03a9\n\u03b3e2 Ik3\nV Ke h2 (h\u22121)J 2\n\nKe\nnuclear relaxation time ( \u03b3\u03b3ne )2 ( K\n)tBar\nn\n\ntnucl\n\nValue (s)\n\n9.84 \u00d7 106 (\n\n\u03c1\u03022\n)f (s)a7\u22125 ( JJd )2 F (\u03c4el )\nK\u0302e T\u0302d 1\n\nJd 2\n21.35\u03c1\u03022 a7\u22125 f1 (s)\u011dn4 \u03bc\u0302\u22122\nn ( J ) F (\u03c4n )\n2\n\ntB,nucl exp(0.5[ JJ 2 \u2212 1])\n\nttf\n\nthermal flipping time\n\ntc\n\ncrossover time\n\ntL\n\nLarmor precession time\n\n2\u03c0\u03bcd Ik\n\u2032\n\u03c7 VB\n\n1/2\n\u03c1\u0302T\u02c6d \u03b1\u0302\n)1/2 f2 (s)a\u22125\n\u0174 \u03b6\u0302 2 n\u03022 T\u0302g\n\u02c6\n1.1 \u00d7 106 ( \u03c1\u0302Td )a2\u22125 s2\n\u03c7\u0302B\u0302\n\ntRT\n\nRadiative precession time\n\n2\u03c0\n|d\u03c6/dt|\n\n1/2\n3\u00d7107\n\u03c1\u0302b\u22125 ( 1 )\nQ\u0302e3\n\u03bb\u0302\u00fbrad\n\ntgas\n\ngas damping time\n\n4Ik\nnmvth b4\n\ntE\n\nelectric precession time\n\n2\u03c0\n\u03a9E\n\n0.2 \u00d7 1011 p\u22121 \u00ca \u22121 \u03c1\u0302\u03c9\u0302a\u22125\n\ntDG paramagnetic damping time\n\n2\u03c1a2\n5K(\u03c9)T2 B 2\n\n1013 B\u0302 \u22121 K\u0302 \u22121 a2\u22125 s2\n\nd\n\n2Jd,\u22a5\nLbz\n\nNotations:\na: minor axis\na\u22125 = a/10\u22125 cm\nh = Ik /I\u22a5 : ratio of moment inertia\n\n1.6 \u00d7 109 (\n\n4.6 \u00d7 1012 (\n\nb: major axis\ns = a/b < 1: ratio of axes\n\u03c1\u0302 = \u03c1/3gcm\u22123 : normalized grain density\n\nT\u0302g = Tg /85K: normalized gas temperature\nT\u0302d = Td /15K: normalized dust temperature\nTrot = (Tg + Td )/2: rotation temperature\n\u22123\nn\u0302 = n/20cm\n: normalized gas density\nB\u0302 = B/5\u03bcG: normalized magnetic field\n\u2032\n\u03c7 = 10\u22123 \u03c7\u0302/T\u02c6d : real part of magnetic susceptibility\nK\u0302e = Ke /10\u221213 F \u22121 (\u03c4e )\nKe,n \u03c9: imaginary part of magnetic susceptibility by electron and nuclear spin\ng \u03bc\n\u03bcd : grain magnetic moment\n\u03b3e = e~ B : magnetogyric ratio for electron\ngn \u03bcn\n\u03b3n =\n: magnetogyric ratio nuclei\n~\n\u03bcN = e~/2mp c = 5.05 \u00d7 10\u221224 ergs G\u22121\n\n\u03bc\u0302n = \u03bcn /\u03bcN : normalized magnetic moment of nucleus\nIk I\u22a5 kTd\n\n)\nJd = ( I \u2212I\n\u22a5\nk\nt\u22121\n\nB,nucl\n\n1/2\n\n: grain angular momentum at T = Td\n\nJtherm : grain angular momentum at T = Tgas\n\n= t\u22121 + t\u22121 : total nuclear relaxation time\nB\n\ncan also include inelastic relaxation\n\nnucl\n\n\u00fbrad = urad /uISRF : energy density of radiation field\nQ\u0302e3 = Q\u0393 .e3 /10\u22122 : third component of radiative torques\np = 10\u221215 \u00db a\u22125 \u03ba\u02c6e : electric dipole moment\n\u00db = U/0.3V : normalized voltage\nLb\nz : magnitude of H2 torque\n\u0174 = W/0.2: kinetic energy of H2\nF (\u03c4 ) \u2261 [1 + (\u03a9\u03c4 /2)2 ]2\n\u03c4el : electron spin-spin relaxation rate\nf1 (s) \u2261 s\u22126 (1 + s2 )2\n\n\u03bb\u0302 = \u03bb/1.2\u03bcm: wavelength of radiation field\nE = \u00ca/10\u22125 V cm\u22121 : electric field\n\u03ba\u02c6e = \u03bae /10\u22122 : electric constant\n\u03c9\u0302 = \u03c9/105 rad s\u22121 : angular velocity\n\u03b6\u0302 = \u03b6/0.2 fraction of absorbed atoms\n\u03b1\u0302 = \u03b1/1011 cm\u22122 : density of recombination sites\n\u03c4n : nuclear spin-spin relaxation rate\n\u03bce \u2248 \u03bcB ; \u03bcB \u2261 e~/2me c: Bohr magneton\n2\nf2 (s) \u2261 ( 1+s 2 )1/2\ns(1\u2212s )\n\nMartin 1995). However, detailed calculations in Roberge & Lazarian (1999)\nshowed that the degree of alignment achievable cannot account for the observed polarization coming from molecular clouds if grains rotate thermally.\nThis is the consequence of the thermal suppression of paramagnetic alignment\nfirst discussed by Jones & Spitzer (1967). These internal magnetic fluctua20\n\n\u03c1\u0302s\n1/2 )sb\u22125\nn\u0302T\u0302g\n\n\ftions randomize grain orientation with respect to the magnetic field if the\ngrain body temperature is close to the rotational one.\nP79 pointed out that fast rotating grains are immune to both gaseous and\ninternal magnetic randomization. Thermal trapping that we discussed in \u00a73.2\nlimits the range of grain sizes for which Purcell's torques can be efficient\n(LD99ab). For grains that are less than the critical size, which can be 10\u22124 cm\nand larger, rotation is essentially thermal (see section 3.2). The alignment of\nsuch grains is expected to be in accordance with the DG mechanism predictions (see Lazarian 1997, Roberge & Lazarian 1999), and seem to be sufficient\nto explain the residual alignment of small grains that is seen in the Kim &\nMartin (1995) inversion (see \u00a76.5).\nLazarian & Draine (2000) predicted that PAH-type particles can be aligned\nparamagnetically due to the relaxation that is faster than the DG predictions.\nIn fact, they showed that the DG alignment is not applicable to very swiftly\nrotating particles, for which the Barnett magnetic field gets comparable to\nmagnetic fields induced by uncompensated spins in the paramagnetic material. For such grains, this relaxation is more efficient than the one considered\nby Davis & Greenstein (1951). This effect, that is termed \"resonance relaxation\" in Lazarian & Draine (2000), allows the alignment of PAHs. These tiny\n\"spinning\" grains are responsible for the anomalous foreground microwave\nemission (Draine & Lazarian 1998, see also Lazarian & Finkbeiner 2003 for a\nreview).\n\n4.3 Mechanical Alignment\nThe Gold (1951) mechanism is a process of mechanical alignment of grains.\nConsider a needle-like grain interacting with a stream of atoms. Assuming\nthat collisions are inelastic, it is easy to see that every bombarding atom\ndeposits with the grain an angular momentum \u03b4J = matom r \u00d7 vatom , which\nis directed perpendicular to both the needle axis r and the velocity of atoms\nvatom . It is obvious that the resulting grain angular momenta will be in the\nplane perpendicular to the direction of the stream. It is also easy to see that\nthis type of alignment will be efficient only if the flow is supersonic 8 .\nSuprathermal rotation introduced in Purcell (1979) persuaded researchers that\nmechanical alignment is marginal. Indeed, it seems natural to accept that fast\nrotation makes it difficult for gaseous bombardment to align grains. However,\nthe actual story is more interesting. First of all, it was proven that mechanical\nalignment of suprathermally rotating grains is possible (Lazarian 1995). Two\n8\n\nOtherwise grains see atoms coming not from one direction, but from a wide cone\nof directions (see Lazarian 1997a) and the efficiency of alignment decreases.\n\n21\n\n\fmechanisms that were termed \"crossover\" and \"cross section\" alignment were\nintroduced there. The mechanisms were further elaborated and quantified in\nLazarian & Efroimsky (1996), Lazarian, Ozik & Efroimsky (1996), Efroimsky\n(2002b). Second, as we discussed in \u00a73.3, the supersonic velocities are available\nover substantial regions of interstellar medium, both due to MHD turbulence\nand ambipolar diffusion.\nIn fact, the discovery of thermal trapping (\u00a73.2) made the original Gold (1951)\nmechanism more relevant. Therefore when grains are not thermally trapped\nand rotate suprathermally the crossover and cross section alignments should\ntake place, while for thermally trapped grains the original Gold mechanism\nremains in force. The quantitative numerical study of the Gold alignment in\nRoberge et al. (1995) was done under the assumption of the perfect coupling\nof J with the axis of maximal inertia (cf \u00a73.1). This study shows a good correspondence with an analytical formulae for the alignment of J vector in L94\nwhen the gas-grain velocities are transsonic. An analytical study in Lazarian\n(1997) accounts for the incomplete internal alignment in a more sophisticated\nway, compared to L94, and predicts the Rayleigh reduction factors of 20% and\nmore for grains interacting with the Alfven waves. A detailed numerical study\nwould be in order to test the predictions.\n\n4.4 Radiative Torque Alignment\n\nAnisotropic starlight radiation can both spin the grains and align them. This\nwas first realized by Dolginov & Mytrophanov (1976), that radiative torques\nare bound to induce alignment. In their paper they considered a tilted oblate\ngrain with the helicity axes coinciding with the axis of maximal inertia, as\nwell as a tilted prolate grain for which the two axes were perpendicular. They\nconcluded, that subjected to a radiation flux, the tilted oblate grain will be\naligned with longer axes perpendicular to magnetic field, while the tilted prolate grain will be aligned with the longer axes parallel to magnetic field. At\nthat time the internal relaxation was not yet a part of accepted grain dynamics. The problem was revisited by Lazarian (1995), who took into account the\ninternal relaxation and concluded that both prolate and oblate grains will be\naligned with longer axes perpendicular to the magnetic field. However, Lazarian (1995) did not produce quantitative calculations and underestimated the\nrelative importance of radiative torque alignment compared to other mechanisms.\nIt happened that the Dolginov & Mytrophanov (1976) study came before\nits time. The researchers themselves did not have reliable tools to study the\ndynamics of irregular grains and the impact of their work was initially low.\nCuriously enough, Purcell studied the aforementioned work, appreciated the\n22\n\n\fFig. 7. (a) Left panel.\u2013 A model of a \"helical\" grain, that consists of a spheroidal\ngrain with an inclined mirror attached to it, reproduces well the radiative torques\n(from LH06). (b) Right panel.\u2013 The \"scattering coordinate system\" which illustrates\nthe definition of torque components: a1 is directed along the maximal inertia axis\nof the grain; k is the direction of radiation. The projections of normalized radiative\ntorques Qe1 , Qe2 and Qe3 are calculated in this reference frame for \u03a6 = 0.\n\nBarnett magnetization described there, but did not recognized the importance\nto the radiative torques. In fact, he had means to calculate them numerically\nusing the Discreet Dipole Approximation (DDA) code available to him.\nThe explosion of interest to the radiative torques we owe to Bruce Draine, who\nrealized that the torques can be treated with the DDA code by Draine & Flatau\n(1994) and modified the code correspondingly. The magnitude of torques were\nfound to be substantial and present for grains of all irregular shapes studied in\nDraine 1996, DW96 and DW97. After that it became impossible to ignore the\nradiative torque alignment. More recently, radiative torques have been studied\nin laboratory conditions (Abbas et al. 2004).\nPotentially, the isotropic radiative torques could ensure suprtathermal rotation\nand provide the alignment in the spirit of P79 mechanism. Indeed, radiative\ntorques are related to the volume of the grain. Therefore a deposition of a\nmonolayer of atoms over the grain surface, i.e. resurfacing, that can reverse\nthe direction of Purcell's torques, does not affect the radiative torques. Longlived suprathermal torques may ensure efficient paramagnetic alignment. In\nthis way the idea of radiative torques is presented in a number of research\npapers. This way of thinking about radiative torque alignment is erroneous,\nhowever.\nIn fact, isotropic torques are fixed in grain coordinates and in all respect are\nsimilar to the Purcell's torques. Therefore, typical interstellar grains driven\nonly by isotropic radiative torques cannot rotate suprathermally due to the\n23\n\n\fthermal trapping effect that we discussed in \u00a73.2.\nMoreover, in most cases the radiation field that we deal with has an appreciable\nanisotropic component. This component induces torques that can align grains.\nDW97 study confirmed that the torques tend to align grains with long axes\nperpendicular to magnetic field.\nObjectively, the DW96 and DW97 papers signified a qualitative change in\nthe landscape of grain alignment theory. These papers claimed that radiative\ntorques alignment may be the dominant alignment mechanism in the diffuse\ninterstellar medium. However, questions about the nature of the alignment\nmechanism, the particular choice of grains studied, as well as the efficiency of\nradiative torques in different environments remained. In addition, the DW97\ntreatment ignored the physics of crossovers (see \u00a73.2). In view of that, I recall\nmy conversations with Lyman Spitzer, who was excited about the efficiency of\nradiative torque, but complained that he was lacking a clear physical picture\nof the alignment mechanism.\n\nFig. 8. Examples of irregular shapes studied in LH07.\n\nFig. 9. (a) Left panel.\u2013 Two components of the radiative torques are shown for our\nanalytical model (solid lines) in Fig. 7a and for an irregular grain in Fig. 8 (dashed\nlines). (b) Right panel.\u2013 Radiative torques for different grain shapes. From Lazarian\n& Hoang (2006).\n\nTo address this concern LH07 proposed a simple model that reproduces well\nthe essential basic properties of radiative torques. The model consists of an\noblate grain with a mirror attached to its side (see Fig. 7a). This model allows an analytical treatment and provides an physical insight why irregular\n24\n\n\fgrains get aligned. In fact, it shows that for a range of angles between the radiation and the magnetic field the alignment gets \"wrong\", i.e. with the long\naxes parallel to magnetic field. However, this range is rather narrow (limited\nto radiation direction nearly perpendicular to magnetic field) and tends to\ndisappear in the presence of internal wobbling (see \u00a73.1).\nIn LH07 we concluded that the alignment of grains with longer axes perpendicular to magnetic field lines is a generic property of radiative torques that\nstems from the basic symmetry properties of the radiative torque components.\nOur work showed that the entire description of alignment may be obtained\nwith the two components of the radiative torques Qe1 and Qe2 as they are\ndefined in the caption of Fig. 7. The third component Qe3 is responsible for\ngrain precession only. The functional dependences of the torque components\nthat are experienced by our model grain are similar to those experienced by\nirregular grains shown in Fig. 8. It is really remarkable that our model and\ngrains of very different shapes have very similar functional dependences of\ntheir torque components (see Fig. 9)! Note that the particular set of grains is\n\"left-handed\". For \"right handed\" grains both Qe1 and Qe2 change simultaneously in a well defined manner. For our grain model to become \"right handed\"\nthe mirror should be turned by 90 degrees.\nThe phase trajectories in Fig. 10 show that only a small fraction of grains get\nto attractor points with high angular momentum. It is most probable for a\narbitrary chosen grain to end up at the attractor point that, in the absence\nof grain thermal wobbling and gaseous bombardment, corresponds to J \u2192 0.\nWithin this model it is only natural to get grain aligned with J \u223c Jd when\nthermal wobbling is included, as this is observed in WD03 (see \u00a73.2).\n\nFig. 10. (a) Left panel.\u2013 Phase trajectory map obtained for the model grain given\nshown in Fig. 7. (b) Right panel.\u2013 The same for an irregular grain in Fig. 8 (shape\n1). From Lazarian & Hoang (2006).\n\nWhat does make grains helical? Both rotation about a well defined axis and\ngrain irregularity do this. For instance, if we attach the weight-less mirror\nto a sphere rather than an oblate body, this would average out the radiative\n25\n\n\ftorques as the mirror will be constantly changing its orientation in respect to\nthe rotational axis.\n\n4.5 Sub-sonic Mechanical Alignment as Next Challenger\nAs we mentioned earlier, the requirement of the supersonic drift limits the\napplicability of mechanical alignment. Such drift is, however, not necessary\nfor helical grains. The model grain in Fig. 7a is helical not only in respect to\nradiation, but also to mechanical flows (see also LH07). In fact, the functional\ndependence of the torques that we obtain for our model grain does not depend\non whether photons or atoms are reflected from the mirror. Therefore we may\npredict that, if atoms bounce from the grain surface elastically, the helical\ngrains 9 will align with long grain axes perpendicular to the flow in the absence\nof magnetic field. If the dynamically important magnetic field is present, the\nalignment is expected with long axes perpendicular to B. If atoms stick to the\ngrain surface and then are ejected from the place of their impact, this changes\nthe values of torques by a factor of order unity.\nIt is easy to understand why supersonic drift is not required for helical grains.\nFor such grains the momentum deposited by regular torques scales in proportion to the number of collisions, while the randomization adds up only\nas a random walk. In fact, the difference between the mechanical alignment\nof spheroidal and helical grains is similar to the difference between the Harwit (1971) alignment by stochastic absorption of photons and the radiative\ntorque alignment. While the Harwit alignment requires very special conditions to overpower randomization, the radiative torques acting on a helical\ngrain easily beat randomization.\nSimilarly, as in the case of the radiative torques, it is possible to disregard the\nHarwit process, it may be possible to disregard the Gold-type processes (see\nTable 2 and \u00a74.3) for irregular grains. As the grain helicity does not change\nsign during grain flipping, the thermal trapping effects described in LD99a are\nabsent for the mechanical spin-up of helical grains.\nThe properties of helical grains require detailed studies. For instance, in the\npresence of Purcell's thrusters and no flipping (see Fig. 4a), the helical grain\nmay induce its own translational motion as it rotates.\nWhat would it take to make a grain helical for mechanical interactions? This\nis a question similar to one that worried researchers with the radiative torques\nbefore Bruce Draine made his simulations. We do not have the simulations\n9\n\nThe mechanical alignment of helical grains was briefly discussed in Lazarian\n(1995) and Lazarian, Goodman & Myers (1997), but was not elaborated there.\n\n26\n\n\fof mechanical torques on irregular grains, but in analogy with the radiative\ntorques, I would claim that such torques should be generic for an irregular\ngrain, provided that there is a correlation of the place where an atom hits\nthe grain and where it evaporates from the grain. It is intuitively clear that\nthe effects of helicity should be more important for larger grains. As the relative gas-grain drift induced by gyroresonance (Yan & Lazarian 2003) is faster\nfor larger grains this can be used as another argument for relatively better\nalignment of large helical grains.\nAs the physics of helical grain alignment and those previously known mechanical alignment mechanisms is different, we can talk of a completely new process\nof alignment that can be tentatively termed \"sub-sonic mechanical alignment\"\nto stress its independence of supersonic drift. The traditional supersonic mechanical alignment mechanisms we discussed in \u00a74.3 tend to minimize grain\ncross section. This means, for instance, that for grains streaming along magnetic fields, the stochastic torques tends to align grains with longer axes parallel to magnetic field. On the contrary, our study in LH07 showed that the\nmechanical torques on helical grains tend to align grains in the same way as\nthe radiative torques do, i.e., the helical grains will tend to be aligned perpendicular to magnetic field irrespectively of the direction of the drift. Further\nwork should show in what situations the \"sub-sonic mechanical alignment\"\ncan reveal magnetic fields when radiative torques fail to do this.\nAll in all, our considerations above suggest that the helicity is an intrinsic\nproperty of rotating irregular grains and therefore the mechanical alignment\nof helical grains should overwhelm any mechanical alignment process discussed\nin \u00a74.3 when the two mechanism tend to align grains in opposite directions.\nThis raises questions of whether we can ever expect to have alignment with\ngrain long axes parallel to magnetic field (cf. Rao et al. 1998, Cortes et al.\n2006). Can the alignment of helical grains fail? This can happen, for instance,\nin the absence of correlation of the impact and evaporation sites of impinging\natoms. This issue can be clarified by laboratory studies.\n\n5\n\nDominant Mechanism: Progress and Problems\n\n5.1 Niches for Mechanisms and Quantitative Theory\nIt is clear that the major alignment mechanisms discussed in \u00a74 have their\nown niches. For instance, Davis-Greenstein mechanism should be important\nfor small paramagnetic grains as the ratio of the paramagnetic alignment\nrate to the gaseous randomization rate scales inversely proportional to grain\nsize (see Lazarian & Draine 2000). At the same time, the most promising\n27\n\n\fmechanism, the radiative torque one, is not efficient for sufficiently small grains\n(i.e. \u03bb \u226b a). We summarize the current situation with the known alignment\nmechanisms by Table 2. Conservatively, we did not include in the table the\nmechanical alignment of helical grains, an interesting mechanism that have\nnot been properly studied yet.\nIf grains are superparamagnetic (Jones & Spitzer 1967, Mathis 1986), they\ncan be aligned, provided that their rotational temperature is larger than the\ngrain temperature. As the rate of paramagnetic relaxation for \"super\" grains\nis larger than the rate of collisional damping, it is this faster rate that should\nstrongly affect the phase trajectory of grains subjected to radiative torques.\nWe showed that the gyroresonance acceleration of grains discussed in \u00a73.3\nallowed an efficient acceleration of grains to supersonic velocities. Note, that\nthe processes enabling a supersonic drift have been the stumbling block for\nthe mechanism. In this sense the Gold-type mechanisms for thermally rotating\ngrains and crossover and cross section mechanisms for suprathermally rotating\ngrains might look currently promising. However, the competition with the\nmechanical alignment of helical grains and the radiative torque alignment\nlimits the range of circumstances where the process dominates.\nThe radiative torque alignment looks the most promising at the moment. As\nwe have discussed in \u00a74.3 it allows predictions that correspond well to observational data. Nevertheless, both the observational testing of the theory and\nthe improvement of the radiative torque \"cookbook\" are essential. Some of\nthe required improvements are obvious. For instance, the position of the lowJ attractor points (see Fig. 10), at which most of the aligned grains reside,\nshow variations with the grain shape. Therefore to predict the expected alignment measure, i.e., R (see eq. 4), more precisely, one may need to consider a\nvariety of grain shapes. The calculation of radiative torques for a given radiation spectrum, a given distribution of grain sizes and a variety of shapes is\na challenging computational task. Fortunately, LH07 showed that, with satisfactory accuracy the radiative torques demonstrate self-similarity, i.e. can be\npresented as a function of \u03bb/a only (see also Cho & Lazarian 2006).\nThe quantitative theory for different mechanisms is at different stages of development. For some mechanisms, e.g. for the Davis-Greenstein alignment,\nthe theory is detailed and well-developed for spheroidal grains (see Roberge &\nLazarian 1999 and references therein). There are reasons to believe that these\nresults should be applicable also to realisticly irregular grains. However, at the\nmoment the mechanism does not looks promising for alignment of grains larger\nthan 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm. The paramagnetic alignment theory for suprathermally rotating grains had been developed before the discovery of thermal flipping and\nthermal trapping effects (Lazarian & Draine 1999ab). Therefore the model of\nalignment in Lazarian & Draine (1997) is applicable to grains larger than a\n28\n\n\fcritical size ac which is approximately 10\u22124 cm. The relative role of the Purcell suprathermal torques and the radiative torques requires further studies for\nvarious astrophysical environments. Cho & Lazarian (2005) claimed that the\nradiative torques are dominant for the molecular cloud interiors where large\ngrains are present. Similarly, the domain of applicability of the suprathermal\nmechanical alignment (Lazarian 1995, Lazarian & Efroimsky 1996, Lazarian\net al. 1996, Efroimsky 2002a) is also limited by the grains larger than ac .\nThe radiative torque alignment mechanism has undergone dramatic changes\nin the last 10 years. From the mostly forgotten one it has risen to the dominant\none. The alignment has been studied for grains assuming perfect alignment\n(DW97, LH07), as well as taking into account thermal fluctuations (WD03,\nHoang & Lazarian 2007). Moreover, the process of alignment is not any more a\nresult of numerical experimentation. A simple analytical model in LH07 does\nreproduce the essential features of the alignment. However, a more rigorous\nstudies of the effects of the incomplete internal alignment on radiative torques\nare necessary. An approach based on the elimination of the fast variable presented in Roberge (1997) seems promising if we want to get precise measures\nfor the grain alignment (see eq. 4)).\nObtaining alignment measures when several alignment processes act simultaneously is another challenge for quantitative studies. It has been addressed in\nRoberge et al. (1995) numerically and in Lazarian (1997) analytically for the\nsituation when the mechanical and paramagnetic alignment mechanisms act\n29\n\n\fsimultaneously. In reality, a number of possible combinations is higher and\nthe interaction of different mechanisms may be very non-linear. For instance,\nradiative torques can prevent some grains from thermal flipping thus changing\nthe conditions for other mechanisms to act. The studies in WD03, LH07 and\nHoang & Lazarian (2007) show that the fraction of such suprathermal grains\nis not large, however.\n\n5.2 New Situations, New Challenges\nAs the grain alignment theory matures, it starts to deal with a wider variety\nof astrophysical situation, rather than just interstellar grains. This opens new\nopportunities for astrophysical magnetic fields studies, but also poses new\nchallenges.\nConsider, for instance, the alignment of grains in accretion disks. The grains\ntheir may be very large, up to \"pebble\" size. As grains get larger the physics\nof their alignment changes 10 . For instance, for grains larger than 10\u22123 cm the\nmechanical alignment arising from the difference in the positions of the center\nof pressure and the center of gravity, the so-called \"weathercock mechanism\"\n(Lazarian 1994b), gets important. In addition, for larger grains, the internal\nalignment through nuclear relaxation gets subdominant compared to inelastic\nrelaxation (P79, Lazarian & Efroimsky 1999). Eventually, all internal alignment mechanisms get inefficient. This is a regime that earlier researchers,\nwho were unaware of internal relaxation processes, dealt with (see Dolginov\n& Mytrophanov 1976).\nInterestingly enough, some earlier abandoned mechanisms may get important\nin new situations. Take, for instance, the \"iron fillings\" mechanism, that considers alignment of iron needles along magnetic fields. This mechanisms proposed by Spitzer & Tukey (1951) at the very beginning of the grain alignment\nstudies, may still be important if grains are sufficiently large and magnetic\nfields are strong.\nEnvironments for alignment may be quite exotic. For instance, it is a good\nbet to disregards electric fields in interstellar gas. However, it may not always\nbe true. According to private communication from Jim Hough electric fields\ncould align dust grains in the Earth atmosphere. Serezhkin (2000) estimated\n10\n\nThe observations of very large aligned grains is a separate issue that we do not\ndwell upon. If aligned grains are much larger than the wavelength of observations,\nthey do not produce polarized signal. This means that to study the alignment\nof large grains one should increase the wavelength of observations. The magnetic\nfield mapping with aligned large grains may require taking into account polarized\nsynchrotron foreground.\n\n30\n\n\felectric fields that may be present in comet comas. This opens a completely\nnew avenue for research. Indeed, first of all, electric fields can serve as the\n\"axis of alignment\" provided that grains have dipole moments 11 (see a discussion of the latter point in Draine & Lazarian 1998). Thus, the radiative\ntorque, subsonic and supersonic mechanical alignment processes can happen\nin respect to the electric field. Then, an analog of the \"iron fillings\" alignment is possible, especially, if grains have properties of electrets (Hilczer &\nMalecki 1986). Moreover, an electric analog of paramagnetic relaxation is possible as grains rotate in electric field. Some materials, e.g. segnetoelectrics (see\nMantese and Alphay 2005), are particularly dissipative and can act the same\nway as superparamagnetic inclusions act to enhance the efficiency of the D-G\nrelaxation.\nThe issue of the direction of alignment requires care when the parameters of\nthe environment changes. For instance, it was discussed in Lazarian (2003)\nthat the alignment in typical interstellar medium conditions would happen in\nrespect to magnetic field, irrespectively of the mechanism of alignment. This is\nthe consequence of the fast Larmor precession. Even if magnetic field changes\nits direction over the time scales longer compared to the Larmor period, the\nangle between J and local B is preserved as the consequence of the preservation\nof the adiabatic invariant. Note, that depending on the mechanism, the grains\nmay align with their longer axes either perpendicular or parallel to magnetic\nfield, however.\nOther situations when magnetic field is not the axis of alignment are also\npossible. Consider, for instance, radiative torques. Whether the radiation direction or magnetic field is the axis of alignment depends on the precession\nrate around these axes (see Table 1). For instance, in the vicinity of stars the\ngrains can to get aligned in respect to the radiation flux, however. For a star\nthe radius at which the light acts as the axis of alignment changes from of 1\nAU for magnetic field of 10\u22123 G to 103 AU for the field of 10\u22126 G (LH07).\nLight flashes from supernovae explosions may impose the direction of the photon flux as the alignment axis over larger scales. At the same time, one can\ncheck that for typical diffuse ISM (see Table 1) is tL /tRT \u223c 10\u22123 , i.e. the Larmor precession is much faster than precession induced by radiation. Therefore\nmagnetic field stays the alignment axis as it was assumed in the earlier work.\nSimilarly, gas streaming can induce its own alignment direction. Dolginov &\nMytrophanov (1976) assumed that whether magnetic field or a gaseous flow\ndefines the axis of alignment depended on the ratio of Larmor precession\ntime to that of mechanical alignment. LH07, however, concluded that the\nprecession time of a grain in a gaseous flow (an analog of tRT in Table 1)\n11\n\nEven in the absence of electric field grain dipole moments can affect grain dynamics (see Draine & Lazarian 1998b, Yan et al. 2004, Weingartner 2006).\n\n31\n\n\fshould be taken instead. The latter time is orders of magnitude less than the\ntime assumed in Dolginov & Mytrophanov (1976). As the result, high density\nmolecular outflows can overwhelm the magnetic field and impose its direction\nas the direction of alignment, provided that the directions of the outflow and\nmagnetic field do not coincide (LH07). Interestingly enough, the mechanical\nflows can define the axis of alignment even for subsonic flow velocities, i.e. at\nthose velocities for which the process considered by Dolginov & Mytrophanov\n(1976) is not efficient.\nOther processes may also be important in more restricted situations. Consider,\nfor instance, the grain spun-up by cosmic rays (Sorrell 1995ab). The calculations by Lazarian & Roberge (1997b) show, that for the cosmic-ray-induced\ntorques to be important, the enhancement of the low energy cosmic ray flux\nover its typical interstellar value by a factor of more than 103 (10\u22125 cm/a)\nis necessary. Therefore this process could only be important over localized\nregions near cosmic ray sources.\n\n5.3 Avenues for Theory Advancement\n\nIt is easy to notice that both studies of irregular grains and subtle physical\neffects have provided the major boost for the grain alignment theory. Indeed,\nthe theory started with the favorite with physicists \"spherical cow\" model,\nwhich literally corresponded to the assumption of spherical grains in D-G\nmodel. Later, the studies of the alignment of oblate and prolate grains have\nbeen undertaken. However, completely new effects were revealed when irregular grains were considered. Indeed, the helicity, which is the key ingredient\nfor both the operation of the radiative torques (see \u00a74.4) and the subsonic\nmechanical alignment (see \u00a74.5), is zero for spheroidal grains.\nSimilarly, an adequate treatment is necessary for grain properties. Originally\ngrains were considered as solid absolutely rigid passive bricks without internal structure. It is only later, that effects of elasticity as well as magnetomechanical effects were considered. The back-reaction of thermal fluctuations\non grain dynamics through these effects changed drasticly our understanding\nof both grain dynamics and alignment. Improvements in this direction can be\nobtained by accounting for the triaxial ellipsoids of inertia corresponding to\nirregular grains. Some work in this direction has been already done for the\ninelastic relaxation (see Efroimsky 2000).\nWe believe that more effects will be considered as grain alignment theory matures and is being applied to new astrophysical environments. For instance, we\nhave discussed above, that potentially grain surface physics may be essential\nfor the mechanical alignment of helical grains. Plasma-grain interactions seem\n32\n\n\fto be another promising direction, which has been marginally developed so\nfar (see Draine & Lazarian 1998b, Yan et al. 2004, Shukla & Stenflo 2005).\n\n6\n\nPolarimetry and Grain alignment\n\n6.1 Grain Alignment in Molecular Clouds\nPolarization arising from aligned grains provides a unique source of information about magnetic fields in molecular clouds. For many years this has been\nthe most important practical motivation for developing the grain alignment\ntheory.\nThe data on grain alignment in molecular clouds looked at some point very\nconfusing. On one hand, optical and near-infrared polarimetry of background\nstars did not show an increase of polarization degree with the optical depth\nstarting with a threshold of the order of a few (Goodman et al. 1995, Arce\net al. 1998). This increase would be expected if absorbing grains were aligned\nby magnetic field within molecular clouds. On the other hand, far-infrared\nmeasurements (see Hildebrand 2000, henceforth H00) showed strong polarization that was consistent with emission from aligned grains. A quite general\nexplanation to those facts was given in Lazarian, Goodman & Myers (1997,\nhenceforth LGM97), where it was argued that all the suspected alignment\nmechanisms are based on non-equilibrium processes that require free energy\nto operate. Within the bulk of molecular clouds the conditions are close to\nequilibrium, e.g. the temperature difference of dust and gas drops, the content\nof atomic hydrogen is substantially reduced, and the starlight is substantially\nattenuated. As the result the major mechanisms fail in the bulk part of molecular clouds apart from regions close to the newly formed stars as well as the\ncloud exteriors that can be revealed by far-infrared polarimetry.\nThe alternative explanations look less appealing. For instance, Wiebe & Watson (2001) noted that small scale turbulence in molecular clouds can reduce\nconsiderably the polarization degree even if grain alignment stays efficient.\nThis, however, is inconsistent with the results of the far-infrared polarimetry\nthat revealed quite regular pattern of magnetic field in molecular clouds (see\nH00).\nAn extremely important study of alignment efficiency has been undertaken\nby Hildebrand and his coworkers (Hildebrand et al. 1999, Hildebrand 2000,\n2002). They pointed out that for a uniform sample of aligned grains, made of\ndielectric material consistent with the rest of observational data, polarization\ndegree, P (\u03bb), should stay constant for \u03bb within the far-infrared range. The\n33\n\n\fdata at 60 \u03bcm, 100 \u03bcm from Stockes on the Kuiper Airborne Observatory,\n350 \u03bcm from Hertz on Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, and 850 \u03bcm from\nSCUBA on the JCMT revealed a very different picture. This was explained\n(see Hildebrand 2002) as the evidence for the existence of the populations of\ndust grains with different temperature and different degree of alignment. The\ndata is consistent with cold (T=10 K) and hot (T=40 K) dust being aligned,\nwhile warm (T=20 K) grains being randomly oriented (H00). If cold grains are\nidentified with the outer regions of molecular clouds, hot grains with regions\nnear the stars and warm with the grains in the bulk of molecular clouds the\npicture gets similar to that in LGM97.\n\nFig. 11. (a) Left Panel: Aligned grain size vs. visual extinction AV . For the threshold\nsuprathermal angular velocity 5 times larger than the thermal angular velocity was\nchosen. It is clear that increase of grain size can compensate for the extinction of\nlight in cloud cores. Solid line: nH = 104 cm\u22123 ; Dotted line: nH = 105 cm\u22123 in the\ncloud. (from Cho & Lazarian 2005) (b) Right Panel: The 850 \u03bcm emission map of\nthe model cloud. Superimposed are the projected polarization vectors (from Bethell\net al. 2006).\n\nHowever, the data obtained for pre-stellar cores in Ward-Thompson et al.\n(2000) seem to be at odds with the LGM97 predictions. Indeed, the properties\nof these cores summarized in Ward-Thompson et al. (2002) and Crutcher et\nal. (2004) fit into the category of zones that, according to LGM97, should not\ncontain aligned grains.\nWhat could be wrong with the LGM97 arguments? The latter paper treats\ngrains of 10\u22125 cm size. The grains in prestellar cores can be substantially larger.\nGrain alignment efficiency depends on grain size. Therefore the estimates in\nLGM97 had to be reevaluated.\nCho & Lazarian (2005, henceforth CL05) revealed a steep dependence of radiative torque efficiency on grain size. While an earlier study by Draine &\nWeingartner (1996) was limited by grains with size a \u2264 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm, CL05\nstudied grains up to 3\u00d710\u22124 cm size subjected to the attenuated radiative field\n34\n\n\fcalculated in accordance with the prescriptions in Mathis, Mezger & Panagia\n(1983). Fig. 11a shows that large grains can be efficiently span up by radiative\ntorques even at the extinction of Av of 10 and higher. A numerical treatment\nof the radiative transfer was used in the papers that followed, e.g. Pelkonen\net al. (2006), Bethell et al. (2006) (see Fig. 11b and 12).\n\nFig. 12. (a) Left Panel.\u2013 The polarization degree for 850 \u03bcm emission from a cloud\nas a function of normalized emission intensity for the actual calculated degrees of\nalignment (real alignment) and assuming that all grains are perfectly aligned. (b)\nRight Panel.\u2013 The polarization spectra of a model core and a \"starless\" molecular\ncloud. The projected Hale polarimeter wave-band coverage is also shown. From\nBethell et al. (2006).\n\nFig. 12a illustrates that a naive assumption of the perfect alignment results in\na substantial overestimation of the polarization degree. While the polarization\nspectra in Fig. 12b is obtained for a starless core/cloud, a more non-trivial\nbehavior is expected for a cloud with active star formation. This calls for\nmulti-frequency observations (see also H00).\nWe note, that in CL05 and the subsequent papers the efficiencies of radiative torques in terms of alignment were parameterized in terms of maximal\nrotational velocities \u03a9max achievable by the torques. As we discussed in \u00a74.4,\nmost of the interstellar grains do rotate thermally in the presence of radiative torques. Nevertheless, the above parameterization does characterize the\nrelative role of the randomizing atomic collisions and aligning effects of the\nradiative torques. Our tests that include simulated gaseous bombardment in\nHoang & Lazarian (2007) show that grains are being aligned by radiative\ntorques when \u03a9max > 3\u03a9thermal,gas .\n6.2 Testing Alignment at the Diffuse/Dense Cloud Interface\nThe grain alignment theory can be directly tested at the cloud interface.\nMathis (1986) explained the dependence of the polarization degree versus\nwavelength , namely the Serkowski law (Serkowski 1973) (see also Fig. 13a)\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nP (\u03bb)/Pmax = exp \u2212Kln2 (\u03bbmax /\u03bb) ,\n35\n\n(11)\n\n\f(where \u03bbmax corresponds to the peak percentage polarization Pmax and K is\na free parameter), assuming that it is only the grains larger than the critical size that are aligned. Those grains were identified in Mathis (1986) as\nhaving superparamagnetic inclusions and therefore subjected to more efficient\nparamagnetic dissipation.\nThe ratio of the total to selective extinction Rv \u2261 Av /EB\u2212V reflects the mean\nsize of grains present in the studied volume. It spans from \u223c 3.0 in diffuse\nISM to \u223c 5.5 in dark clouds (see Whittet 1992 and references therein) as the\nmean size of grain increases due to coagulation or/and mantle growth. The\nearlier studies were consistent with the assumption that the growth of Rv was\naccompanied by the corresponding growth of \u03bbmax (see Whittet & van Brenda\n1978). The standard interpretation for this fact was that as grains get bigger,\nthe larger is the critical size starting with which grains get aligned. This interpretation was in good agreement with Mathis' (1986) hypothesis of larger\ngrains having superparamagnetic inclusions. However, a more recent study by\nWhittet et al. (2001) showed that grains at the interface of the Taurus dark\ncloud do not exhibit the correlation of Rv and \u03bbmax . This surprising behavior was interpreted in Whittet et al (2001) as the result of size-dependent\nvariations in grain alignment with small grains losing their alignment first as\ndeeper layers of the cloud are sampled. Whittet et al (2001) did not specify the\nalignment mechanism, but their results posed big problems to the superparamagnetic mechanism (see \u00a74.2). Indeed, the data is suggestive that Rv and\ntherefore the mean grain size may not grow with extinction while the critical\nsize for grain alignment grows.\n\nFig. 13. (a) Left Panel: Serkowski curves and fits by radiative torque models. (b)\nRight Panel: pmax /AV as function of AV from our calculations with radiative torques\n(solid line) and the observation data by Whittet et al. (2001). The interface is simulated as a homogeneous slab. The MRN distribution of dust with amax = 0.35\u03bcm\nwas used. From Hoang & Lazarian (in preparation).\n\nLazarian (2003) noticed that the Whittet data agrees well with the expectations of the radiative torque mechanism. We present in Fig. 13b our recent\nfit for the data using the radiative torques that arise from the attenuated\ninterstellar radiation field.\n36\n\n\f6.3 Alignment in Magnetized Disks around stars\nMagnetic field plays important roles in the evolution of protostellar disks.\nMagnetic pressure can provide extra support to the disks and magnetic field\ncan promote removal of angular momentum from disks (see Velikov 1959;\nChandrasekhar 1961; Balbus & Hawley 1991). However, there are many uncertainties in the structure and the effects of the magnetic field in protostellar\ndisks. Quantitative studies of magnetic fields in the disks are essential therefore.\nConsider T Tauri stars first. Tamura et al. (1999) detected polarized emission\nfrom T Tauri stars, which are low mass protostars. Aitken et al. (2002) studied\npolarization that can arise from magnetized accretion disks. They considered\na single grain component consisting of the 0.6\u03bcm silicate and used an ad hoc\nassumption that all grains at all optical depths are aligned with R = 0.25.\nCho & Lazarian (2006) used a more sophisticated model for grain alignment.\nThey calculated the radiative torques acting on grains, assuming the model of\nthe disk in Fig. 14a. The results of their calculations are shown in Fig. 14b.\nIt is clear that with multiwavelengths observations it should be possible to\nseparate the contributions arising from the disk surface and interior.\n\nTds\nsurface layer\nH=4h\ndisk interior\n\ninner part\n\nTi\n\nouter part of disk\n\nFig. 14. (a) Left panel.\u2013 A schematic view of the disk model. The surface layer is\nhotter and heated by the star light. The disk interior is heated by re-processed light\nfrom the surface layers. We assume that the disk height, H, is 4 time the disk scale\nheight, h. (b) Right panel.\u2013 Spectral energy distribution. The vertical axis (i.e. \u03bbF\u03bb )\nis in arbitrary unit. Results are for oblate spheroid grains with axis ratio of 1.5:1.\nFrom Cho & Lazarian 2006.\n\nThis is the first attempt to simulate polarization from a disk on the basis\nof grain alignment theory. More attempts should follow. In fact, it has been\nknown for decades that various stars, both young and evolved, exhibit linear\npolarization (see a list of polarization maps in Bastien & Menard 1988). While\nmultiple scattering has been usually quoted as the cause of the polarization,\nrecent observations indicate the existence of aligned dust around eta Carinae\n37\n\n\f(Aitken et al. 1995) and evolved stars (Kahane et al. 1997). This suggests\nthat for other stars the dust should be also aligned (Chrisostomou et al 2000).\nIn fact, some of the arguments that were used against aligned grains are, in\nfact, favor them. For instance, Bastien & Menard (1988) point out that if\npolarization measurements of young stellar object were interpreted in terms\nof grain alignment with longer grain axes perpendicular to magnetic field, the\nmagnetic field of accretion disks were in the disk plane. This is exactly what\nthe present day models of accretion disks envisage.\nInterestingly enough, alignment of dust in environments different of diffuse\nISM and molecular clouds was professed by a number of pioneers of the grain\nalignment research. For instance, Greenberg (1970) claimed that interplanetary dust should be mechanically aligned. Dolginov & Mytrophanov (1976)\nconjectured that comet dust and dust in circumstellar regions was aligned.\nHowever, both the problems in understanding of grain alignment and the inadequacy of polarimetric data did not allow those views to become prevalent\n(although see Wolstencroft 1985, Briggs & Aitken 1986 where alignment was\nsupported). I feel that now we have a much better case to include alignment\nwhile dealing with polarization from dust in various environments. Quantitative modeling should both test grain alignment theory and environments\nunder study.\n\n6.4 Grain Alignment in Comets\nThe \"anomalies\" of polarization from comets 12 (see Martel 1960, Beskrovnaja\net al 1987, Ganesh et al 1998) as well as circular polarization from comets (\nMetz & Haefner 1987, Dollfus & Suchail 1987, Morozhenko et al 1987) are\nindicative of grain alignment.\nHowever, conclusive arguments in favor of grain alignment were produced for\nthe Levi (1990 20) comet through direct measurements of starlight polarization, as the starlight was passing through comet coma (Rosenbush et al 1994).\nThe data conclusively proved the existence of aligned grains in comets.\nNote, that the issue of circular polarization was controversial for a while. When\nboth left and right handed polarization is present in different parts of coma\nthe average over entire coma may get the polarization degree close to zero.\nThis probably explains why earlier researchers were unsuccessful attempting\n12\n\nWhen light is scattered by the randomly oriented particles with sizes much less\nthan the wavelength, the scattered light is polarized perpendicular to the scattering\nplane, which is the plane passing through the Sun, the comet and the observer.\nLinear polarization from comets has been long known to exhibit polarization that\nis not perpendicular to the scattering plane.\n\n38\n\n\fto measure circular polarization while using large apertures. Recent measurements by Rosenbush et al. (1999), Manset et al. (2000) of circular polarization\nfrom Hale-Bopp Comet support the notion that circular polarization is a rule\nrather than an exception.\n\nFig. 15. Zones of grain alignment in respect to magnetic field and in respect to radiation/electric field for a comet at 1AU from the Sun. Radiative torque alignment.\nFrom Hoang & Lazarian (2007).\n\nA more recent paper by Rosenbush et al. (2006) reports circular polarization\nfrom a comet C/1999 S4(LINEAR). The data indicates that the polarization\narises from aligned grains. The mechanism of alignment requires further studies, however. If magnetic fields do not penetrate into coma, the alignment\nhappens in respect to direction of radiation (see \u00a75.2) no circular polarization\nis possible (see Eq. (8)). Outflow velocities are not vividly supersonic to allow\nefficient Gold alignment. What is the mechanism that produces the circular\npolarization? Several explanations are possible on the basis of our earlier discussion. First of all, the alignment observed may be the sub-sonic mechanical\nalignment of irregular grains (see \u00a74.5). Second, the alignment may be due to\nradiative torques, but the outflow could alter the direction of the axis of alignment. The structure of the \"precessing\" radiative torque component is such\nthat the precession rate goes to zero as the grain gets aligned in respect to\nthe radiation. Therefore it is easy to perturb the alignment axis for radiative\ntorques. Third, as we discussed in \u00a75.3 electric field could cause grain precession and even grain alignment. The choice between these possibilities should\nbe made on the basis of comparing the results of modeling with observations.\n39\n\n\fWe illustrate the model of alignment in a comet in Fig. 15.\n6.5 Alignment of Small Grains\nFor particles much less than the wavelength the efficiency of radiative torques\ndrops as (a/\u03bb)4 (see L95). Within circumstellar regions, where UV flux is\nenhanced smaller grains can be aligned by radiative torques. This could present\na possible solution for the reported anomalies of polarization in the 2175 \u00c5\nextinction feature (see Anderson et al 1996) which have been interpreted as\nevidence of graphite grain alignment (Wolff et al 1997). If this alignment\nhappens in the vicinity of particular stars with enhanced UV flux and having\ngraphite grains in their circumstellar regions, this may explain why no similar\neffect is observed along other lines of sight.\nThe maximum entropy inversion technique in Kim & Martin (1995) indicates\nthat grains larger than a particular critical size are aligned. This is consistent\nwith our earlier discussion of radiative torques and the Serkowski law (see\n\u00a76.2). However, an interesting feature of the inversion is that it is suggestive\nof smaller grains being partially aligned. Initially, this effect was attributed to\nthe problems with the assumed dielectric constants employed in the inversion,\nbut a further analysis that we undertook with Peter Martin indicated that\nthe alignment of small grains is real. Indeed, paramagnetic (DG) alignment\nmust act on the small grains 13 . An important feature of this weak alignment\nis that it is proportional to the energy density of magnetic field. This opens\na way for a new type of magnetic field diagnostics. As very small grains may\nemit polarized radiation as they rotate (see \u00a74.2) both UV and microwave\npolarimetry may be used to estimate the intensities of magnetic field.\n\n7\n\nConcluding remarks\n\n7.1 Present situation\nHistorically the goal of the grain alignment theory was to account for puzzling\npolarimetric observations. The situation has changed, however, as grain alignment became a predictive theory. This calls for more quantitative modeling\nand for more further polarimetry data acquisition, to test the models.\n13\n\nTo avoid a confusion we should specify that we are talking about grains of\n10\u22126 cm. For those grains the results of DG relaxation coincide with those through\nresonance relation in Lazarian & Draine (2000). It is for grains of the size less than\n10\u22127 cm that the resonance relaxation is dominant.\n\n40\n\n\fIt was not possible in the present review to discuss all the interesting cases\nwhere grain alignment may be important. Theoretical considerations suggest\nthat grain alignment should take place within various astrophysical environments. Polarized radiation from neighboring galaxies (Jones 2000), galactic\nnuclei (see Tadhunter et al 2000), AGNs, Seyfet galaxies (see Lumsden et\nal 2001) can be partially due to aligned particles. Revealing this contribution\nwould allow us to study magnetic fields in those and other interesting settings.\nPolarization from aligned grains can benchmark other techniques for magnetic field studies. For instance, anisotropies of the magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) turbulence reveal the local direction of the magnetic fields; those can\nbe measured with observations of the Doppler-shifted spectral lines (Lazarian\net al. 2001, Esquivel & Lazarian 2005 and references therein). Polarimetry of\naligned grains provides a way of testing the accuracy of this new technique.\nSimilarly, aligned grains can remove the 90 degrees uncertainty arising in the\nmagnetic field studies based upon the Goldreich-Kylafis effect or alignment of\natoms/ion with fine or hyperfine structure 14 , as proposed by Yan & Lazarian\n(2006, 2007).\nRecently, promising attempts have been made to test the predictions of the\ngrain alignment theory (see Hildebrand 2003, Andersson & Potter 2005, 2006,\n2007), or to use the grain alignment theory to explain observations (see Frisch\n2006, Cortes & Crutcher 2006). It is significant that the numerical simulations\nthat include theory-motivated prescriptions for grain alignment (see \u00a76) allow\neasy comparisons with observations. If combined with new polarimetric instruments, that have been built recently or are to be built in the near future,\nthis ensures progress in reliable tracing of magnetic fields using aligned grains.\n\n7.2 Important questions\n\nIn regards to practical studies of magnetic fields a few questions will be in\norder.\n\u2022 What is the advantage of the far-infrared polarimetry for studies of magnetic\nfields in molecular clouds compared to the optical and near-infrared observations? An immediate answer would be that the far infrared polarimetry reveals\naligned grains near newly born stars, unaccessible to optical or near-infrared\nphotons. An additional advantage of the far infrared spectropolarimetry stems\nfrom the fact that it allows us to separate contributions from different parts of\n14\n\nFor the Goldreich-Kylafis (1982) effect this uncertainty is intrinsic, while for the\ntechnique proposed in Yan & Lazarian (2006, 2007) the uncertainty can be removed\nby using several aligned species.\n\n41\n\n\fthe cloud (see Hildebrand 2000). This will enable us to carry out tomography\nof the magnetic field structure.\n\u2022 What is the future of the optical and near-infrared polarimetry? It would\nbe wrong to think that with the advent of the far-infrared polarimetry there\nis a bleak future for extinction polarimetry at shorter wavelengths. In fact, its\npotential for studies of magnetic fields in the Galaxy is enormous (see Fosalba\net al. 2002, Cho & Lazarian 2002a). The possibility of using stars at different\ndistances from the observer allows to get an insight into the 3D distribution of magnetic fields. In general, however, it is extremely advantageous to\ncombine polarimetric measurements in optical/near-infrared and far-infrared\nwavelengths. For instance, it may be pretty challenging to trace the connection of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) with the ambient interstellar medium\nusing just far-infrared measurement. However, if extinction polarimetry of the\nnearby stars is included, the task gets feasible (see Poidevin & Bastien 2006).\nSimilarly, testing modern concepts of MHD turbulence (see Goldreich & Shridhar 1995) and turbulent cloud support (see McKee 1999) would require data\nfrom both diffuse and dense media.\n\u2022 Is it possible to study magnetic fields using radiation scattered by aligned\ngrains? The studies of molecular cloud column densities with the near infrared\nscattered light were presented in Padoan et al (2006) and Juvela et al. (2006).\nThose have shown that large scale mapping of scattered intensity is possible\nup to Av \u223c 10 even for clouds illuminated by the average interstellar radiation\nfield. The polarization of scattered light should be affected by grain alignment.\nThis opens interesting prospects of detailed mapping of magnetic fields at subarcsecond resolution, which for the closest star forming regions corresponds\nto the scale of \u223c 100 AU. This can bring to a new level both the studies of\nmagnetic fields in star forming regions and observational studies of magnetic\nturbulence.\n\u2022 What is the advantage of doing polarimetry for different wavelengths? The\nlist of advantages is rather long. It is clear that aligned grains can be successfully used as pick up devices for various physical and chemical processes,\nprovided that we understand the causes of alignment. Differences in alignment\nof grains of different chemical composition (see Smith et al. 2000) provides a\nunique source of the valuable information. Comets present another case in\nsupport of simultaneous multifrequency studies. There the properties of dust\nevolve in a poorly understood fashion and this makes an interpretation of\noptical polarimetry rather difficult. Degrees and directions of dust alignment,\nthat can be obtained that can be obtained via far infrared polarimetry, can be\nused to get a self-consistent picture of the dust evolution and grain alignment.\n\u2022 Do we need the grain alignment theory to deal with polarized CMB foregrounds? Polarized emission spectra arising from aligned dust may be very\n42\n\n\fcomplex if grains of different temperatures exhibit different degrees of alignment. In this situation, the use of the naive power-law templates may result\nin huge errors unless we understand grain alignment properly. Needless to say,\na well developed grain alignment theory is required to predict the spectra of\npolarized emission from PAHs in the range of 10-100 GHz.\n\u2022 What is the optical depth Av at which aligned grains fail to trace magnetic\nfields? The answer depends on the grain size and the grain environments. If we\nconsider a starless cloud/core illuminated by the interstellar radiation field,\nfor grains of 10\u22125 cm the radiative alignment fails at Av \u223c 1.4 (see Arce et al.\n1998). However, larger grains in cloud cores can be aligned at Av > 20 as was\nshown by Cho & Lazarian (2005, 2006), which is a great news for polarimetric\nstudies of star formation. In the vicinity of stars and in the presence of graingas drift smaller grains can also be aligned.\n\u2022 What is the niche for the magnetic field studies with aligned grains? If we\ntry to answer this question briefly, we can point out that the aligned grains\ntrace magnetic fields in molecular clouds and cold diffuse gas, where so far\nthey have little competition from other techniques. Both observations and\ntheory show that grain alignment is a robust process that can operate in\nthe presence of very weak magnetic fields. I would like to stress the synergy\nof the starlight/dust emission polarimetry and other techniques of magnetic\nfield studies. Indeed, the different techniques provide us with the data on\nmagnetic fields in different environments, e.g. different phases of the interstellar medium. We can obtain an adequate picture of magnetized astrophysical\nsettings by combining the techniques, e.g. dust polarimetry, synchrotron polarimetry, polarimetry of aligned atoms/ions and molecules.\n\n7.3 Brief Summary\n\nThe principal points discussed above are as follows:\n\u2022 Grain alignment results in linear and circular polarization. The degree of\npolarization depends on the degree of grain alignment, the latter being the\nsubject of the grain alignment theory.\n\u2022 Substantial advances in understanding grain dynamics, subtle magnetomechanical effects, as well as the back-reaction of thermal fluctuations on\ngrain rotation have paved the way for the advances in understanding of\ngrain alignment.\n\u2022 The grain helicity has been established as an essential property of irregular\ngrains rotating about their axis of the maximal inertia. This allowed for a\nbetter physical understanding of the radiative torque's role, and allowed to\nintroduce new alignment mechanisms, e.g. the sub-sonic mechanical align43\n\n\f\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nment.\nThe grain alignment theory has, at last, reached its mature state when\npredictions are possible. In most cases grain alignment takes place with\nrespect to magnetic field, thereby revealing the magnetic field direction,\neven if the alignment mechanism is not magnetic.\nThe radiative torque alignment, after having been ignored for many years,\nhas become the most promising mechanism which predictions agree well\nwith interstellar observations. To create alignment, this mechanism does\nnot rely on paramagnetic relaxation.\nIt is clear that the importance of grain alignment is not limited to interstellar\nmedium and molecular clouds. Polarimetry can be used to study magnetic\nfields in accretion disks, AGN, circumstellar regions, comets etc.\nAs astrophysical environments exhibit a wide variety of conditions, various\nalignment mechanisms have their own niches. The importance of studying the alternative mechanisms increases as attempts are made to trace\nmagnetic fields with aligned grains in the environments other than the interstellar one.\n\nAcknowledgments.
