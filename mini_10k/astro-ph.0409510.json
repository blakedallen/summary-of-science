We present the results of a narrow-band infrared imaging survey of a narrow strip (12\u2032 wide) around the\ngalactic equator between 6\u25e6 and 21\u25e6 of galactic longitude aimed at detecting field stars with strong CO absorption,\nmainly late-type giants and supergiants. Our observations include follow-up low resolution spectroscopy (R = 980)\nof 191 selected candidates in the H and K bands. Most of these objects have photometric and spectroscopic\ncharacteristics consistent with them being red giants, and some display broad, strong absorption wings due to\nwater vapor absorption between the H and K bands. We also identify in our sample 18 good supergiant candidates\ncharacterized by their lack of noticeable water absorption, strong CO bands in the H and K windows, and HKS\nphotometry suggestive of high intrinsic luminosity and extinctions reaching up to AV \u2243 40 mag. Another 9\nadditional candidates share the same features except for weak H2 O absorption, which is also observed among\nsome M supergiants in the solar neighbourhood. Interesting differences are noticed when comparing our stars\nto a local sample of late-type giants and supergiants, as well as to a sample of red giants in globular clusters\nof moderately subsolar metallicity and to a sample of bulge stars. A large fraction of the stars in our sample\nhave CaI and NaI features markedly stronger than those typical in the local reference sample (both giants and\nsupergiants), whereas the equivalent widths of the CO bands are similar or weaker. In this regard, our stars in\nthe inner Milky Way disk display differences very similar to those identified by other authors between cool giants\nand supergiants near the galactic center and their counterparts in the solar neighbourhood. We propose that\nthe systematic spectroscopic differences of our inner Galaxy stars are due to their higher metallicities that cause\ndeeper mixing in their mantles, resulting in lower surface abundances of C and O and higher abundances of CN,\nwhich contribute to the strength of the CaI and NaI features at low resolution.

Introduction\nAs compared to the large amount of information available nowadays on the inner regions of nearby galaxies,\nthe Population I component of the central kiloparsecs\nof the Milky Way is still relatively unknown.

Comer\u00f3n et al.: A search for late-type supergiants in the inner regions of the Milky Way\n\ntinuum and recombination line emission have supplied\nmuch of our present knowledge on the gas photoionized\nby massive stars (Lockman 1989, Helfand et al. 1992,\nWhiteoak 1992, Becker et al. 1989, Kuchar & Bania 1992,\nMcClure-Griffiths 2001, Kolpak et al. 2003), and on the\nnonthermal emission due to recent supernovae in the inner\nGalaxy (Leahy & Wu 1989, Green 1991, 2001). Molecular\nline emission surveys have provided an overall picture of\nthe distribution and physical conditions of giant molecular clouds (Dame et al. 1987, 2001, Chiar et al. 1994,\nBronfman et al. 1996, 2000, McQuinn et al. 2002), while\nmid-infrared surveys such as that carried out by IRAS\nhave revealed a wealth of star forming sites (Wood &\nChurchwell 1989, Hughes & MacLeod 1989, Codella et\nal. 1995, Comer\u00f3n & Torra 1996, Egan et al. 1998). Recent\nnear-infrared surveys like DENIS (Ruphy et al. 1997,\nL\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2001, Van Loon et al. 2003),\n2MASS (Alard 2001, Ojha 2001, L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et\nal. 2002) or TMGS (L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 1999, 2001,\nPicaud et al. 2003) are yielding extensive lists of stellar\nobjects suitable for studies of galactic structure. Valuable\nas all those observational approaches are, each one has\nits own limitations and needs to be complemented by the\nothers in order to provide a global picture of the young\ncomponent of the inner parts of our Galaxy. On the other\nhand, this young component is an excellent tracer of processes of primary importance concerning the structure and\nthe composition of our Galaxy, such as the dynamical response of the disk to the central bar, the location of the\nspiral arms, the current star forming activity, or the radial\ndependency of the chemical composition, thus justifying\nthe efforts leading to the characterization of its properties.\nIn this paper we present a study on a particularly\npromising, yet relatively unexploited, Population I tracer\nin the inner Galaxy. Late-type supergiant stars have interesting properties that make them particularly suitable\nfor the study of aspects of the extreme Population I component that are either inaccessible or very elusive in other\nobjects of similar age, such as the structure, kinematics, and chemistry of the young galactic disk, while their\nnumerical abundance can provide a measurement of its\npresent-day massive star formation rate. They have extremely bright magnitudes at infrared wavelengths, where\nthe dust in the galactic disk is far less opaque than in\nthe visible. As it turns out, a nearly complete census of\nlate-type supergiants in our Galaxy is in principle a feasible task for a moderately large telescope equipped with\na near-infrared camera, even if some of the targets may\nbe as far as 25 kpc away and obscured by as much as\n50 mag at V . While the bright magnitudes of supergiants\nfacilitate detection, the infrared spectral properties of cool\nphotospheres facilitate their identification in conveniently\ndesigned infrared surveys. The K-band spectra of objects\nwith temperatures below \u223c 3500 K are characterized by\nprominent CO bands appearing longwards of 2.29 \u03bcm,\nthus allowing the selection of candidate late-type stars\n(red giant branch (RGB) stars, long period variables in the\nassymptotic giant branch (AGB), and red supergiants) by\n\ncomparing narrow band images centered respectively on\nand off the CO band region. At low- and medium- resolution spectroscopy, many narrow atomic features in the\nH and K bands allow further investigation of their intrinsic properties via their different sensitivities to temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and surface abundances.\nMoreover, infrared observations of cool, luminous stars in\nthe inner galactic disk provide actual, individual stellar\ntemplates suitable for the interpretation of the integrated\nspectrum of systems undergoing massive star formation,\nsuch as central starbursts and the environments of AGNs\n(e.g. Origlia et al. 1993, Kotilainen et al. 1996, Origlia &\nOliva 2000, F\u00f6rster-Schreiber et al. 2001, Alonso-Herrero\net al. 2001), and are an important component in the modeling of the integrated light of entire systems (e.g. Fioc &\nRocca-Volmerange 1997, Bruzual & Charlot 2003).\nThis paper describes a search for late-type luminous,\nobscured cool field stars in a 15\u25e6 -long strip of the galactic plane of approximately 12' width in galactic latitude,\nconsisting of narrow-band imaging and low resolution\nfollow-up spectroscopy of the best candidates identified.\nAlthough our focus is on the identification criteria of cool\nsupergiants we also have obtained as a byproduct a large\nnumber of spectra of cool RGB and AGB stars in the same\ngeneral direction, which can be a useful resource for studies of metallicity patterns across the inner galactic disk\nand for the construction of templates in integrated stellar\npopulations spectra.\nThe observations and data reduction process are described in Section 2. The results are presented in Section 3,\nwhere we discuss the properties of our sample and its comparison to those of reference samples containing objects in\nthe solar neighbourhood, in the galactic bulge, and in relatively metal-rich globular clusters. We discuss criteria that\nallow the definition of a sample of red supergiant candidates and present a list of the best ones identified among\nour observed objects. Section 4 discusses one of the main\nresults of our work, concerning systematic spectral differences that we find between our objects and those in the\ntwo reference samples. Section 5 summarizes our results.\n\n2. Observations\n2.1. Near-infrared imaging\n2.1.1. Observing strategy and filter choice\nThe basis for our preliminary identification of possible\ncool supergiants consists of multiband images of narrow\nstrips parallel to the galactic plane obtained with MAGIC,\nthe near-infrared camera and spectrograph at the 1.23 m\ntelescope at the German-Spanish Astronomical Center in\nCalar Alto. In imaging mode, MAGIC yields a pixel scale\nof 1\"15 per pixel resulting in a field of view of 4\u2032 9 \u00d7 4\u2032 9\nover the 256 \u00d7 256 pixel2 array. Our imaging observations\nwere obtained on two separate observing runs, carried out\nrespectively on 3-13 July 1998 and 19-21 June 2001.\nThe observations consisted of obtaining sequences of\nshort exposures at positions separated by 1' intervals along\n\n\fF. Comer\u00f3n et al.: A search for late-type supergiants in the inner regions of the Milky Way\n\nthe galactic plane. Since the edges of the detector were\naligned along the North-South and East-West directions\nand the series of images were obtained by moving the telescope along the galactic equator, stars lying at galactic latitudes near the edge of the coverage of the sequences were\nobserved in fewer telescope pointings. At the beginning of\neach sequence the filter and the detector integration parameters were set, and then the sequence was started to\nobtain a total of 180 overlapping fields covering an arc\nof 3\u25e6 in galactic longitude. The starting positions corresponded to galactic longitudes of l = 6\u25e6 , 9\u25e6 , 12\u25e6 , 15\u25e6 , and\n18\u25e6 , and galactic latitudes of b = 0\u2032 , +4\u2032 , and \u22124\u2032 , thus allowing in principle overlap between contiguous sequences\neither in galactic longitude or latitude. Unfortunately, a\nmajor mechanical intervention on the mount of the 1.23m\ntelescope between our two runs produced a slight misalignment of its polar axis and an inaccurate pointing model\nin our run of 2001. As a result, the sequences starting at\nb = \u22124\u2032 and the one at l = 15\u25e6 , b = +4\u2032 are not exactly\nparallel to the galactic equator and do not overlap over\ntheir entire lengths with contiguous sequences starting at\nthe same galactic longitude.\nFour filters were used: a CO filter centered at 2.295 \u03bcm\nwith a relative width \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb = 1%, a K-continuum narrowband filter centered at 2.260 \u03bcm with \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb = 2.6%, and\nthe broad-band filters J (1.25 \u03bcm, \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb = 24%) and H\n(1.65 \u03bcm, \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb = 18%). The choice of narrow-band filters aims at allowing the detection of stars with large flux\ndrops due to CO absorption, which is a characteristic feature of late-type photospheres, by comparing the images\ntaken through the narrow-band CO and K-continuum filters (see below), while the broad-band filters were initially intended to locate objects in color-color and colormagnitude diagrams. Exposure times per telescope position were 9 seconds in the CO filter; 6 in the K-continuum\nfilter; 4 in the H filter; and 8 in the J filter. These exposure times were obtained by stacking together as many\nindividual exposures of 1 second each as needed. The exposure time per sky position is variable, as it depends on\nthe number of telescope pointings containing that position as described above. It ranges from one to six times\nthe exposure time per field, the latter value corresponding to stars lying close to the central galactic latitude of\nthe sequence. Each frame was combined with the overlapping portion of the images taken before and after in the\nsequence in order to filter out remaining unmasked bad\npixels or cosmic ray hits.\nIn general preference was given to completing one sequence in all filters before proceeding to the next one, in\norder to have observations as closely spaced as possible.\nHowever this had to be often overridden due to visibility\nconstraints as the regions imaged, lying at declinations\nbetween \u221224\u25e6 and \u221210\u25e6, are visible few hours per night\nfrom a mid-Northern site like Calar Alto. A consequence\nof this is that observations through the different filters are\nnot consecutive in some cases, but separated by an interval\nof two days at most. Such time differences are nevertheless\nnegligible by comparison to typical variability periods of\n\n3\n\nevolved red stars, and we thus considered them entirely\nacceptable for the goals of our project.\n\n2.1.2. Data reduction and calibration\nThe reduction of our imaging data, as well as of our spectra as described in Section 2.2, was carried out using\nIRAF1 tasks and dedicated scripts. The images were reduced using dome flat fields in each filter that were used\nalso to construct bad pixel masks. Dark-subtracted, flatfielded and masked images were sky-subtracted by constructing a sky frame made out of the 20 frames taken\nclosest in time, conveniently median-averaged and with\nthe stellar images removed by sigma clipping. Next, the\nimages obtained within each of the b = 0\u25e6 sequences in\nthe CO on-band filter, which we took as a reference, were\nmosaicked into a single large image. To this end, accurate\noffsets between consecutive pointings in a sequence were\ndetermined by automatically finding stars in the common\narea of overlapping images and using them as a reference.\nIn case that a contiguous sequence (i.e., one starting at the\nsame galactic longitude but a different latitude) was obtained during the same run, a similar procedure was used\nto align its component images with the reference b = 0\u25e6\nsequence: the position of each individual image along the\nparallel sequence with respect to the reference one was determined by using stars in the overlapping areas. This was\nnot possible when sequences starting at the same galactic longitude were obtained on different runs, due to the\npointing model inaccuracy outlined above. In such cases\nthe sequence obtained on the second run was combined\nseparately. The combined image in the CO filter was used\nas the reference for the alignment of each frame in the\nother filters, thus avoiding large misalignments between\nimages in different filters due to accumulated small errors\nin the registering of consecutive images in each of them.\nDue to the crowdedness of the fields in the galactic\nplane and the undersampling of the point-spread function, digital photometry with an undersized aperture of 2\npixel (2\"3) radius was found to provide the best results.\nTo compensate for the variability of the sky transparency\nconditions and for the variable image quality during the\nexecution of any given sequence, instrumental zeropoint\nvariations along the sequence were determined by comparing the digital photometry on the brightest nonsaturated stars in the area common to each pair of overlapping frames. Zeropoints for each sequence in the J, H,\nand K-continuum bands were estimated by comparing our\ninstrumental photometry of bright nonsaturated stars to\nthe 2MASS catalog, assuming that the narrow-band Kcontinuum magnitude can be approximated by the broadband 2MASS KS magnitude.\nThe outlined procedure for photometric calibration is\nappropriate to yield moderate accuracies in the J, H, and\n1\n\nIRAF is distributed by NOAO, which is operated by the\nAssociation of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.,\nunder contract to the National Science Foundation\n\n\f4\n\nF. Comer\u00f3n et al.: A search for late-type supergiants in the inner regions of the Milky Way\n\nK-continuum bands that are sufficient for our purposes: a\ncomparison of the instrumental and 2MASS magnitudes\nshow typical scatters of \u223c 0.1 mag around the average\nzeropoints, and a drift of the zeropoint of the same order at most along a given sequence. However, scatters\nof that order are too large for an appropriate measurement of the flux drop due to CO absorption, that we use\nas the primary criterion to select candidate cool stars in\nour sample. We thus used instead a self-calibrated method\nbased on the fact that, in any random stellar field, most\nof the stars are expected to have a negligible drop in\nthe flux at the position of the CO bands. We calculated\nlocal zeropoints of the photometric CO index (defined\nas [CO]phot = m(2.295) \u2212 m(2.26), where m(2.295) and\nm(2.26) are the magnitudes in the CO and K-continuum\nfilters respectively) at each longitude by assuming that\nits value averaged over a large number of randomly selected stars must be very close to zero. This average was\ncalculated considering the stars located within |\u2206l| = 10\u2032\nof each longitude point and on the same galactic longitude band, and with weights inversely proportional to the\nsquare of the probable error in magnitude of each contributing star. The calculation was done in two steps, the\nfirst one including all the stars in the average and the second removing stars with a highly deviant [CO]phot . In this\nway, cool stars that could skew the distribution of [CO]phot\nvalues could be selected as those stars standing out due to\na value of that index greater than a given threshold above\nthe average value of the surrounding stars.\nA master list of detected stars was obtained by\ncoadding the images taken in all the filters and running\nDAOFIND (Stetson 1987) on the combined image. With\nthis master list of stellar positions, we performed digital\nphotometry with DAOPHOT on the images in each filter\nto obtain the multiband photometry of each star detected\nin the combined image. Many stars were not detected in\nsome bands, either because they fell just outside the edges\nof the image due to small differences between the starting position of the sequence in each filter, because they\nwere too faint in that filter to be detected, or because of\nconfusion with a nearby source in the case of the images\nobtained under poorer seeing conditions. Finally, approximate stellar positions in J2000 coordinates were determined by using as a reference the positions of unobscured\nstars in our images that could be identified in Digitized\nSky Survey, and whose equatorial coordinates were available from the USNO astrometric catalog.\nWe must remark at this point that the conditions under which our observations were made resulted in an uneven depth of the catalog and other factors affecting its\ncompleteness. Seeing conditions during the execution of\nthe observations ranged from \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 to over 3\u2032\u2032 , thus resulting in a regional dependence of the source confusion\nlimits. Likewise, part of our sequences was affected by the\npresence of high altitude dust combined with the need for\nobserving often at high airmasses, producing regional dependencies of the depth of the frames. The net effects of\nall these circumstances are rather uncertain and difficult\n\nFig. 1. Distribution of the magnitudes of the stars in our\nsample in the J, H, and K-continuum filters.

The shallower limit at K is due to the use of\na narrow-band filter to estimate the K magnitude. On\nthe other hand, deeper limits in J and H are needed\nto estimate the reddening towards the heavily obscured\nstars that are the object of our program. Figure 1 gives\nthe histogram of source counts as a function of magnitude, excluding stars with \u03c3 > 0.3 mag in each band. The\n[CO]phot can be usually measured down to an accuracy\nbetter than 0.1 mag for stars down to K \u2243 10.0, as estimated from the scatter of the measured [CO]phot values\nas a function of K. Although this is a rather modest limit\nin terms of depth, as we will see it is sufficient for our primary purpose of detecting late-type, distant supergiants.\nOur catalog contains 23,388 stars with their [CO]phot indices determined to that level of accuracy. These stars are\nplotted in Figure 2 to illustrate the changing behavior of\n[CO]phot with the (H \u2212 K) color index. The top panel\nshows a sample with relatively blue (H \u2212 K), which can\nbe expected to be dominated by nearby stars with low\nreddening. The distribution of [CO]phot is approximately\nsymmetric around a central value of 0 with a very minor\nfraction of the stars having an index significantly different from that value, in most cases due to measurement\nerrors caused by field crowding or the presence of nearby\ncompanions. Such measurement errors can be reasonably\nexpected to affect stars regardless of their (H \u2212 K). The\nsecond panel, with moderately reddened stars, has a very\nsimilar appearance but shows hints of skewness towards\nhigh values of [CO]phot . The skewness is more clear when\nwe consider the reddest stars in our sample, where we expect an increased contribution of luminous late-type stars\nthat can be detected even at large distances and hence\nlarge amounts of foreground reddening.\n\n2.1.4. Sample selection for spectroscopic follow-up\n\nFig. 2.

Note the use\nof a logarithmic scale in the vertical axis to enhance the\nwings of the distribution of indices, which is strongly\npeaked at [CO]phot = 0.\n\n2.1.3.

This sample was composed of stars having [CO]phot > 0.15 and a K-continuum\nmagnitude brighter than 10. Our selection was further refined by visually inspecting the images in which the stars\nselected according to these criteria appear, and discarding\nstars whose photometry was uncertain due to proximity to\nthe edge of the image (where contamination by unfiltered\nbad pixels or cosmic rays was more frequent) or confused\nby the proximity to nearby bright sources. Such selection\nproduced a list of 204 targets to be spectroscopically observed, out of which three were discarded because of the\npresence of a close companion that was not resolved in\nthe images from Calar Alto. The star numbers given in\nTables 1, 3, and 4 refer to the entry number in this list,\nwhich is sorted by increasing right ascension. The positions and broad-band photometry of the selected sources\nwere obtained from the 2MASS Point Source Catalog, as\n\n\f6\n\nF.

Near-infrared spectroscopy\nThe follow-up spectroscopy of the best candidate cool\nstars selected as described above was obtained using the\nSOFI near-infrared camera and spectrograph at the ESO\nNew Technology Telescope on La Silla, Chile, on the nights\nof 11, 12, and 13 July 2003. The setup and exposure parameters used were identical for all the stars. We used the\nlow-resolution red grism, which covers most of the H and\nK bands from 1.53 \u03bcm to 2.52 \u03bcm at a resolution R = 980\nwith the 0\"6-wide slit that we used. Four spectra were obtained for each star following an AB/BA pattern, with\neach spectrum being the on-detector stack of three exposures of 10 seconds each. The B5V star HD 169033, which\nlies near the arc of the galactic plane where our targets\nare located, was observed at periodic intervals of approximately one hour to sample the evolution of the telluric\nabsorption in the proximities of our field. On the second\nnight of our run we observed both HD 169033 and the solar analog HD 172411 (spectral type G3V) consecutively\nand near their culmination, in order to minimize effects in\nthe telluric features affecting both.\nFor the reduction of the spectra, we started by canceling out the sky emission lines and the detector background by subtracting from each spectrum taken on the A\nposition another taken on the B position, and viceversa.\nTo correct for pixel-to-pixel variations we used a flat field\nobtained with the telescope enclosure closed, subtracting\nexposures taken with a continuum-emitting lamp respectively on and off.\nThe wavelength calibration was carried out in two\nsteps. We first obtained an exposure of a Xenon arc lamp,\nwhich produces a line spectrum conveniently sampling the\nwavelength interval covered by our observations, immediately after observing one of our targets and keeping the\ninstrument in the same position and setup, thus eliminating any possible flexure effects or inaccuracies in repositioning the slit. The arc lamp spectrum was wavelengthcalibrated and the dispersion solution was applied to the\nsky spectrum of the object. In this way precise wavelenghts\nof the sky lines and line blends at the resolution of our\nobservations were determined. The master calibrated sky\nspectrum was then used to wavelength-calibrate the rest\nof the observations. Each individual object spectrum was\nextracted, and the same aperture trace was used to extract\nthe corresponding sky spectrum from an opposite frame\nin the AB/BA cycle. The lines identified in the master sky\nspectrum were then reidentified in the extracted sky spectrum at the position of the object and used to determine a\nnew dispersion solution, which was then applied to the object spectrum. Finally, the four individual sky-subtracted,\nflat-fielded, wavelength-calibrated spectra of each object\nwere combined into a single spectrum. An identical pro-\n\ncedure was used for the telluric calibration star and the\nsolar analog observations.\nTo remove telluric features, the spectrum of each program star was ratioed by the spectra of each of the telluric\ncalibration stars observed on the same night. The residual\nleft after ratioing at the position of the strong CO2 features in the 2.00-2.05 \u03bcm interval was used as a quality\ncriterion to decide on the most suitable telluric calibration star to correct for the telluric features in each program star. Since telluric features generally depend on both\ntime and airmass the selected telluric calibration observation was often, but not always, the one obtained closest\nin time to the observation of the program star.\nThe last step was relative flux calibration and removal\nof photospheric features in the spectrum of the star used\nfor telluric correction. This was carried out by ratioing the\nconsecutive observations of the telluric calibrator and the\nsolar analog described earlier in this Section, and multiplying this ratio by the flux-calibrated solar spectrum. The\nsolar spectrum of Livingston & Wallace (1991) was used\nfor this purpose, with its resolution degraded to match\nthat of our observations, following the procedure described\nby Maiolino et al. (1996). The product of the telluric-oversolar analog ratio and the solar spectrum thus produced\na multiplicative factor as a function of wavelength to be\napplied to our telluric-calibrated program objects in order\nto obtain their flux-calibrated spectrum in arbitrary units.\nOf the 201 stars observed, 194 turned out to display obvious CO absorption bands characteristic of spectral types\nK or M. We discarded the 7 spectra of stars photometrically misclassified as cool stars, as well as 3 additional\nspectra of faint stars showing hints of CO absorption but\nhaving an insufficient signal-to-noise ratio, which either\nprevented the determination of the equivalent widths discussed in this paper or produced measurement errors not\ncomparable to those of the other stars in the sample.\nTable 1 (available in full electronically only 2 ) contains the\nentire sample of 191 stars presented in this paper listing\ntheir positions, 2MASS photometry, and measured equivalent widths of selected features (see Section 3.1). The\nnumbering of the objects discussed in this paper refers to\nthe entry number in that Table. The complete collection\nof reduced spectra used in the forthcoming discussions is\nalso available electronically.\nAs an additional step, we computed radial velocities\nfor all our program stars by cross-correlating their K-band\nspectrum to a zero-velocity cool star template spectrum\nobtained by combining the spectra of M-type giant and\nsupergiant stars in the atlas of Wallace & Hinkle (1997).\nDoppler-corrected spectra were produced in this way for\nall our program stars, as well as for the stars in the Lan\u00e7on\n& Woods (2000) atlas that we use extensively as a reference in the present work (see Section 3.2). The Dopplercorrected spectra were the ones used for the derivation of\nthe equivalent widths discussed in this paper.

Results\n3.1. Equivalent widths and spectrophotometric indices\nAt the relatively low resolution available, the main features that are visible in our K-band spectra are the CO\nbandheads redwards of 2.293 \u03bcm, as well as the NaI feature at 2.208 \u03bcm and the CaI feature at 2.264 \u03bcm3 . Other\natomic lines such as those of FeI and MgI are also easily visible, as well as weaker features due to CN. More\nfeatures appear in the H band. The reader is referred to\nKleinmann & Hall (1986), Wallace & Hinkle (1997) and\nHinkle et al. (1995) for detailed line identifications in these\ntwo bands. The overall shape of the continuum is strongly\naffected by the presence or absence of the broad wings of\nthe water absorption band centered around 1.9 \u03bcm, where\nthe separation between the H and K bands lies. Figure 3\nshows some selected spectra representative of the variety\nfound in our sample.\nA considerable number of slightly different definitions\nof spectral passbands useful for the quantification of different features can be found in the literature (e.g. Lan\u00e7on\n& Rocca-Volmerange 1992; Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. 1997; Lan\u00e7on\n& Wood 2000; F\u00f6rster-Schreiber 2000; Frogel et al. 2001),\nwhich are normally defined in the most convenient way\ngiven the spectral resolution available. Our choice has\nbeen to adopt the K-band indices defined by Frogel et\nal. (2001) for the CaI, NaI, and CO(2,0) features, which\nare also directly comparable to those used by Ram\u0131\u0301rez et\n3\n\nThese features receive their names from the atomic species\nthat normally dominate the absorption at those wavelengths in\nspectra with resolutions R \u223c 1000 or lower. However, higher\nresolution observations reveal contributions also by CN and\natomic species that can become important below 4,000 K\n(Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. 1997), as discussed in Section 4. Although in\nthis paper we refer to these features by their usual denomination in the literature (NaI, CaI), the reader should be aware\nthat these species may not be the only ones contributing to\ntheir strength.\n\nal. (1997, 2000b). They thus allow a straightforward comparison between the spectral characteristics of our objects\nand those of the extensive samples of RGB stars observed\nby those authors in the solar neighbourhood (Ram\u0131\u0301rez et\nal. 1997), the galactic bulge (Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. 2000b), and\nglobular clusters (Frogel et al. 2001) (see Section 3.2).\nMoreover, we have defined additional passbands to measure SiI and CO(6,3) features in the H band, and FeI,\nMgI in the K band. In all cases except for the K-band\nCO features the equivalent widths are measured with respect to the local continuum level interpolated between\ntwo featureless points on both sides of the feature. The\nlack of a continuum longwards of 2.29 \u03bcm in our spectra\nforces us to use an extrapolation instead using two continuum points at shorter wavelengths. The definition of the\non- and off-feature bands used in this paper is given in\nTable 2. Note that the interpolation or extrapolation using two continuum bands makes the measured equivalent\nwidths virtually insensitive to reddening, which is not the\ncase for the [CO]phot defined earlier. Typical uncertainties\nin the equivalent widths that we measure in our spectra\nare \u00b10.5 \u00c5, except for the CO(2,0) band where we estimate \u00b11.0 \u00c5 due to the need to extrapolate from the bluer\ncontinuum.\nThe width of the wings of the H2 O feature separating\nthe H and K bands requires a definition different from\nthe equivalent widths discussed above to quantify their\nstrength. We have thus defined a reddening-free water index, I(H2 O), based on the comparison of the fluxes in two\nbands located on the blue and red wing of the feature and\nthe approximate continuum level measured on unaffected\nparts of the H and K bands. The locations and widths\nL\nL\nof these bands are also listed in Table 2, where fH\n, fK\ndenote the fluxes on the H-band (blue) and K-band (red)\nC\nC\nwing of the feature, and fH\n, fK\nare the respective continuum fluxes.

Their sample\nprovides a wide variety of spectra corresponding to different classes of luminous cool stars in different environments\nsuch as the solar neighbourhood, the galactic bulge, and\nthe Magellanic Clouds, and includes multiepoch observations for a large number of variable stars. Its resolution,\nR = 1100, closely matches that of the spectra presented\nin this paper, thus facilitating a direct comparison (see\nFigure 5). Classes represented in LW2000 include supergiants, thermally pulsating AGB stars of high and low\namplitudes, non-pulsating RGB stars, and carbon stars.\nWe have used the spectra from LW2000 for which\nthose authors present observations in the H and K-band\nand belonging to the samples of supergiants, oxygenrich variables, bulge giants, and non-pulsating RGB stars.\nUnfortunately, few spectra in the H and K bands are\navailable for the latter class of objects in the LW2000\nsample. This shortcoming can be largely circumvented\nby adding the collection of equivalent widths of the NaI,\nCaI, and CO(2,0) features in the K-band spectrum of\nbright giants measured by Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (1997) on spectra having a resolution similar to ours. We have also\nused the lists of equivalent widths of the same features\nin Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (2000b) for as sample of over 100\nbulge RGB stars, and of RGB stars in the most metalrich globular clusters observed by Frogel et al. (2001),\nnamely NGC 5927 ([Fe/H] = \u22120.37), NGC 6440 ([Fe/H] =\n\u22120.34), NGC 6528 ([Fe/H] = \u22120.17), and NGC 6553\n([Fe/H] = \u22120.25). Low-metallicity objects such as those\nin the Magellanic Clouds sample of LW2000 are not expected to be significantly represented among our inner\ngalactic disk objects, and have not been considered here.\nLikewise, there are clearly no carbon-rich stars in our sample (which would be easily distinguishable thanks to the\nstrong C2 feature at 1.77 \u03bcm) and we have thus excluded\nthe objects of that class in LW2000 atlas from the comparison with our results.\n\n3.3.

A comparison between the H and K spectra of one\nsupergiant from the LW2000 library of spectra (above)\nand one supergiant candidate from our sample (below),\nshowing their similar resolution and quality. The comparison also shows the reality of most of the features that\ncan be seen in our spectra. The difference in continuum\nslopes, especially in the H band, is due to the higher extinction towards the star of our sample. The features listed\nin Table 2 are noted.\nthe most prominent molecular features in the H and K\nbands due to water steam and carbon monoxide. CO is\nto a first approximation a temperature indicator with the\ndepth of the bands increasing as temperature decreases.\nHowever, the depth of the CO bandhead at 2.293 \u03bcm\nis also sensitive to the surface gravity and is often used\nas a discriminator between giants and supergiants at a\ngiven temperature (e.g. Kleinmann & Hall 1986, F\u00f6rsterSchreiber 2000, Ivanov et al. 2004). The CO band intensity is also sensitive to the carbon abundance in the atmospheres of oxygen-rich stars and is thus an indicator\nof the importance of the dredge-up processes in the postmain sequence evolution of the star (Carr et al. 2000).\nOn the other hand, strong H2 O absorption is formed in\nthe cool, dense outer layers of large amplitude Mira-type\nand semiregular variables possessing very extended atmospheres with a complicated structure determined by\n\nshocks propagating through them (Bessell et al. 1989 and\nreferences therein), and can be used as a discriminator\nbetween pulsating AGB stars and supergiants (Lan\u00e7on &\nRocca-Volmerange 1992), both of which have overlapping\nluminosity ranges.\nFigure 6 shows the distributions of our sample and the\nLW2000 one in the CO(2,0)-H2 O diagram. The apparent\noverabundance of objects with strong water absorption in\nLW2000 is largely due to the fact that we have plotted\nin the diagram every single observation of each object in\nLW2000 as a separate point; therefore, any given star observed at different phases by LW2000 appears multiple\ntimes in the diagram. Figure 6 shows that our sample is\nstrongly dominated by objects with the spectral characteristics of non-pulsating stars that occupy the locus of red\ngiants and supergiants. The small scatter of I(H2 O) for\nobjects spanning a wide range of extinctions confirms that\nthe extinction law chosen to derive Eq. (1) yields indeed a\nreddening-free index, whereas its steady decline between\nEW [CO(2, 0)] = 10 \u00c5 and 20 \u00c5 is due to the progressive\ndeparture of the H and K band spectrum from a RayleighJeans shape as the temperature decreases and the depth\nof the CO bands increases. Most of our objects have moderate values of EW [CO(2, 0)] that are generally well below those of the sample of LW2000 supergiants, a feature\nthat we will consider in the coming Sections. Finally, the\nobjects with strong water absorption have a preference\ntowards high EW [CO(2, 0)], unlike in the LW2000 sample where large positive I(H2 O) indices are present over\nthe whole range of EW [CO(2, 0)] considered. The trend\nin our sample is qualitatively similar to that observed in\n\n\f10\n\nF. Comer\u00f3n et al.: A search for late-type supergiants in the inner regions of the Milky Way\n\nFig. 7.

Symbols are as\nin Figure 6.\nFigure 13 of Lan\u00e7on & Rocca-Volmerange (1992) where\ntheir objects split along two branches (corresponding to\nRGB stars and supergiants) at the highest EW [CO(2, 0)],\nalthough we do not find the gap between both branches\nsuggested by the results of those authors. Unfortunately,\nno information on the H2 O depression is available in the\ndata published by Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (1997) given their wavelength coverage restricted to the red part of the K band.\nFigure 7 is the analogous of Figure 6, now replacing\nthe CO(2,0) band by the CO(6,3) band at 1.62 \u03bcm. Again\ncool supergiants of the LW2000 sample occupy the region\nof highest CO absorption, now with a larger overlap with\nour sample. A difference with Figure 6 is that objects\nwith I(H2 O) > 0 now populate a broad but clearly defined band so that the objects with the stronger water absorption tend to have the lowest EW [CO(6, 3)]. The same\nbehaviour in this respect can be seen in the LW2000 sample and ours. A closer examination shows that not only\nthe CO(6,3) band, but all the features in the H band are\nweaker among the stars with strong water band wings, indicating the existence of significant veiling correlated with\nthe strength of the water feature. Some degree of veiling\nin the K band as well may be responsible for the relatively\nweak CaI and NaI features of stars with I(H2 O) > 0 in\nFigures 8 and 9.\n\n3.4. The NaI and CaI features\nDiagrams combining absorption in atomic lines and molecular bands having different dependencies on temperature,\nsurface gravity, and metallicity offer in principle important diagnostics on the intrinsic properties of samples of\nindividual cool stars and of composite populations, and\nhave been discussed in a number of studies (see Ivanov et\nal. 2004 for a recent, comprehensive review). A compari-\n\nFig. 8. EW [CaI] vs. EW [CO(2, 0)] diagram comparing\nthe stars in our sample with those of LW2000.

Note\nthe offset between the mean distribution of stars of our\nsample and other reference samples.\n\nson between our sample in the inner Galaxy, the sample of\nLW2000, and the samples of RGB stars in the solar neighbourhood, the bulge, and globular clusters described in\nSection 3.2 can provide insight on possible intrinsic differences of both populations and the way they reflect themselves on measurable spectral features.\nWe have plotted in Figures 8 and 9 the relationship\nbetween the NaI and CaI features and the CO(2,0) bandhead. In particular, the combination of the strength of\na feature essentially dependent on the temperature such\nas CaI and one that combines dependence on both temperature and surface gravity such as CO(2,0) has been\nproposed as a luminosity class discriminator (F\u00f6rsterSchreiber 2000, Ivanov et al. 2004).\nFigures 8 and 9 do not show tight overall correlations\nfor the LW2000 sample, mainly due to the abundance in\nit of AGB stars whose complex, time-dependent atmospheric structure is expected to blur them. However, local\nsupergiants dominate in a well defined region of the diagram characterized by the strongest absorptions in both\nthe CaI and NaI features and CO(2,0).\nThe loose correlation between the CaI or NaI features\nand CO(2,0) is much more apparent when only RGB stars\nand supergiants are considered, as shown in Figures 10 to\n13, where our sample is compared to the local supergiants\nof LW2000 and the RGB stars in the solar neighbourhood (Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. 1997), the galactic bulge (Ram\u0131\u0301rez\net al. 2000b), and the relatively metal-rich globular clusters of Frogel et al.

The strengths of the\nCO(2,0) bandhead in our stars are otherwise similar to,\nor only slightly exceeding, the ones of the coolest RGB\nstars in the local and globular cluster samples. On the\nother hand, the galactic bulge sample has overall characteristics much closer to those of our objects, as shown\nin Figures 12 and 13. The largest measured equivalent\nwidths of the CO(2,0) feature are similar to those of the\nlocal RGB star sample, which may be explained by their\nproximity to saturation and subsequent insensitivity to\nmetallicity differences. However, RGB stars in the bulge\ndo reach the high CaI and NaI equivalent widths that we\nmeasure in our sample and their loci in those diagrams has\na much broader, although not complete, overlap with the\none of our sample. The overlap with this sample is nevertheless poorer at low equivalent widths, where the local\nRGB stars from Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (1997) rather than bulge\nones tend to populate the region occupied by the stars of\nour sample. This is to be expected since stars with lower\nequivalent widths are hotter, and therefore intrinsically\nfainter and more nearby on the average as indicated by\nthe lower reddening of their colors, and can thus be considered as an extension of the local sample.\nMetallicity differences between RGB stars in the solar neighbourhood and in the bulge are the most obvious candidate to produce the systematic shifts between\nsamples in the equivalent width diagrams. The quantification of these differences from low resolution spectra is\nhowever difficult, as the use of relationships calibrated on\nglobular clusters implies their extrapolation outside their\nstrict range of applicability (temperatures, luminosities,\nmetallicities, feature strengths, star formation and chemi-\n\nThe obvious differences in the intrinsic properties of the local sample of giants and the ones in the inner galactic disk,\nrepresented by both our objects and the bulge sample of\nRam\u0131\u0301rez et al. (2000b), leads us to be cautious about possible differences also existing between local supergiants and\nthose in the inner Galaxy that may render inapplicable the\nspectroscopic criteria allowing a separation between giants\nand supergiants in the solar neighbourhood. Indeed, such\ncriteria do not seem to apply at least to giants and supergiants at the galactic center, as concluded by Schultheis\net al. (2003) from their near-infrared study of a sample\nof cool, luminous stars detected in the ISOGAL survey\n(Omont 1996) with spectra obtained with the same instrumentation as ours. Schultheis et al.'s identification of\nfour very likely cool supergiants rests on their derived luminosities, which they estimate based on the assumption\nthat all the sources in their sample lie at the distance\nof the galactic center. This is a reasonable working hypothesis in their case, given the high density of sources\ndetected within a radius of less than 1\u25e6 5 from the galactic center in which foreground contamination is expected\nto be negligible. Unfortunately we cannot make a similar\nassumption on the distance, and are thus forced to examine more indirect means of estimating the luminosity of\nour stars in order to assess the possible presence of supergiants among them, without relying on spectroscopic\ncriteria derived from the solar neighbourhood.\nFigure 14 suggests that it is possible to make a rough\nluminosity estimate based on the 2MASS photometry\nalone. The figure plots the position of all objects in our\nsample in a (H \u2212 KS , KS ) color-magnitude diagram, including AGB stars characterized by their prominent steam\nbands (see Section 3.3), which are marked as full circles. These stars are expected to be long-period variables\nroughly following the period-luminosity relationship for\nMiras and semiregular variables, which has been recently\nreexamined by Knapp et al. (2003) using Hipparcos parallaxes. Their absolute magnitudes range from MK \u2243 \u22126.4\nfor the shortest periods to MK \u2243 \u22128.2 at the tip of\nthe AGB, and thus overlap with the absolute magnitude\nrange of cool supergiants, from which they can be otherwise easily separated spectroscopically. Concerning the\nbrightest AGB stars, their absolute MK magnitudes are\nexpected to depend on the metallicity, primarily due to\nthe cooler temperatures reached at the tip of the RGB\nby the most metal-rich populations as compared to others of lower metallicity, which result on a greater K-band\nbolometric correction (Houdashelt et al. 2000) combined\n\n\fF. Comer\u00f3n et al.: A search for late-type supergiants in the inner regions of the Milky Way\n\nFig. 14. Color-magnitude diagram for the stars in our\nsample. Filled circles represent stars with I(H2 O) > 0\n(large-amplitude variables), expected to be intrinsically\nvery luminous. Magnitudes are from 2MASS. The straight\nline represents the displacement due to an extinction of\nAV = 10, using the Rieke & Lebofsky (1985) extinction\nlaw.\nwith an essentially metallicity-independent bolometric luminosity (Sweigart et al. 1990). A moderate extrapolation\nof the metallicity-MK relationship established by Ferraro\net al. (2000) from a sample of globular clusters to the solar metallicities indicates an expected MK = \u22127 for the\nbrightest RGB stars, thus overlapping with the absolute\nmagnitudes of the AGB stars with the shortest periods.\nThe positions of AGB stars, whose absolute magnitudes are confined to a range of \u223c 2 mag, lie in a relatively well defined band of the (H \u2212 KS , KS ) diagram\nwhose slope results from the combined effect of extinction\nand distance on the apparent KS magnitude. The fact that\nthe scatter within this band is of the order of the scatter\nin the absolute magnitudes of Miras and semiregular variables suggests that the amount of reddening in the H \u2212KS\ncolor can be used as a rough distance indicator. The intrinsic colors of Mira variables are somewhat uncertain: Glass\net al. (1995) finds noticeable differences in intrinsic colors\nwhen comparing Miras in the Large Magellanic Cloud, the\nsolar neighbourhood, and the galactic bulge. They find\nintrinsic H \u2212 K colors of bulge Miras (in the SAAO system) that range between 0.32 and 0.61, which is redder\nthan the reddest RGB stars (Houdashelt et al. 2000) and\nsupergiants (Ducati et al. 2001). Therefore, assuming the\nreddening in H \u2212KS as a proxy for the distance, RGB and\nsupergiants having the same position in the KS , H \u2212 KS\ndiagram as a given AGB star should be more distant, and\ntherefore more luminous.\nThe lower edge of the locus of our large-amplitude\nvariables can be approximated by the straight line KS =\n5.87 + 2.20(H \u2212 KS ), which allows us to define a reference\nmagnitude K0 as\n\n13\n\nFig. 15. Color-color diagram for the stars in our sample, based on 2MASS magnitudes. Filled circles represent\nstars with I(H2 O) > 0 (large-amplitude variables). Fivepointed stars represent our best supergiant candidates (see\nSection 3.7). Note that the J magnitudes of stars with very\nred (H \u2212 KS ) colors are often unreliable due to the likelihood of contamination by nearby stars that are brighter in\nJ. The straight line represents the displacement due to an\nextinction of AV = 10, using the Rieke & Lebofsky (1985)\nextinction law.\n\nK0 = KS \u2212 5.87 \u2212 2.20(H \u2212 KS )\n\n(2)\n\nwhose positive or negative value indicates that the star is\neither below or above the lower edge of the AGB band,\nrespectively. Although it may be tempting to directly relate K0 to MK , it must be noted that the straight line\nis just a convenient approximation to describe the locus\nof AGB stars in our sample and does not have a sound\nphysical foundation. Indeed, it is easy to show that the\nassumption that K0 is simply the absolute magnitude offset by a constant requires the distance modulus to be\nDM = 12.93 + 0.42E(H \u2212 KS ) (where E(H \u2212 KS ) is the\namount of reddening, the coefficient 0.42 preceding it is\nderived from the Rieke & Lebofsky (1985) extinction law,\nand the constant after the equal sign follows from the assumption that the lower edge of the AGB band is defined\nby stars having MK = \u22126.4), which does not allow for\ndistances smaller than 3.8 kpc. Still, the use of Eq. (2) allows the split of our sample between \"bright\" and \"faint\"\nstars taking AGB stars as an appropriate dividing line.\nThe fact that the bulk of stars in our sample falls below\nthe K0 = 0 line in Figure 14 confirms that our sample\nis dominated by giants. However, there are some bright\nstars with different amounts of reddening occupying the\nAGB locus but with no or weak steam absorption; note in\nparticular the group of faint, very red stars at (H \u2212 KS ) >\n2.0. These are some of the most promising M supergiant\ncandidates in our sample.\n\n\f14\n\nF. Comer\u00f3n et al.: A search for late-type supergiants in the inner regions of the Milky Way\n\nThe vast majority of the stars in our sample cluster\nalong the narrow strip of the (H \u2212Ks ), (J \u2212H) color-color\ndiagram that traces the reddening vector (see Figure 15).\nSome stars deviate from this strip apparently occupying\nthe region of bluer-than-normal (J \u2212 H) colors at a given\n(H\u2212KS ) that would indicate the existence of near infrared\nexcess. These are however stars with very red colors whose\nfaint J magnitudes are near or below the confusion limit\nfor 2MASS in the galactic plane, for which the 2MASS\nJ-band measurement is likely to be significantly contaminated by nearby stars. We thus consider the J magnitudes\nas generally unreliable for very red objects, thus precluding a discussion on the infrared excesses of different classes\nof objects.\n\n3.6. Equivalent widths and luminosities\nThe use of K0 as defined in Eq. (2) allows us to study\npossible correlations between this quantity, purely derived\nfrom broad-band photometry, and the equivalent widths\nmeasured on the spectra. The most obvious correlations\namong both types of quantities are shown in Figures 16\nand 17. While both figures are qualitatively similar in\nshowing the increase of average luminosity with increasing CO band depth, there are some interesting differences\nbetween both. The CO(2,0) band depth vs. K0 diagram\nshows an approximately constant slope, with considerable\nscatter, over the whole range of equivalent widths covered by our spectra. Fig. 17 shows however a break in the\ntrend around EW [CO(6, 3)] \u2243 7 \u00c5 with the distribution\nof points flaring up to brighter values of K0 . The clear displacement of the average distribution of stars with strong\nsteam absorption towards lower EW [CO(6, 3)] is a direct\nconsequence of the fact, already mentioned earlier (see also\nFigure 7) that strong steam absorption is correlated with\nweak CO(6,3) absorption, unlike what is observed in the\ncase of the CO(2,0) bandheads.\nLess pronounced, but still obvious correlations with\nK0 are found for the NaI and CaI bands. We have also\nlooked for possible systematic effects of ratios of equivalent widths with K0 that may provide spectroscopic discriminators, in particular the EW (CO(2, 0))/(EW (CaI)+\nEW (NaI)) ratio that Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (1997) proposed to\ndiscern between dwarfs and giants. The usefulness of that\nratio in discriminating also between giants and supergiants\nis suggested by the results of F\u00f6rster Schreiber (2000), and\nhas been investigated by Schultheis et al. (2003) for their\ngalactic center sample. Unfortunately we can only confirm\nthe negative results of Schultheis et al. (2003), at least at\nthe resolution common to our spectra, in which no hints\nof a systematic trend with the luminosity indicator K0 is\nseen.\nOther absorption features appearing in our spectra\nsuch as the MgI (2.281 \u03bcm) or FeI (2.228 \u03bcm) lines may\nalso be useful indicators of temperature, metallicity, or\nsurface gravity. In particular we have attempted to use\nEW [CO(2, 0)]/EW [MgI] as a possible surface gravity in-\n\nFig. 16. EW [CO(2, 0)] vs. the K0 quantity defined in\nEq. (2) for the stars in our sample.

Again we find no systematic trend in our results,\nalthough its possible existence may be hidden due to the\nweakness of the MgI feature that becomes close to the\ntypical \u00b10.5 \u00c5 uncertainty in our equivalent width measurements, thus introducing a large random scatter in the\nratios that we can determine. Similar uncertainties due to\nthe measurement errors relative to the small equivalent\nwidth affect measurements involving the other lines, such\nas FeI (2.228 \u03bcm) or SiI (1.590 \u03bcm)\n\n\fF. Comer\u00f3n et al.: A search for late-type supergiants in the inner regions of the Milky Way\n\n15\n\nLW2000 have noted that the strong CN features appearing shortwards of 1.1 \u03bcm are characteristic of the supergiants of their sample. Unfortunately that spectral region is too heavily obscured in the majority of our sources,\nthus preventing measurements of the strongest CN bands.\nHowever, there are multiple CN features appearing on the\nbluer side of the K band that may provide a useful alternative in heavily reddened objects. We find hints of a\nsurface gravity dependence in the blend of CN lines near\n2.134 \u03bcm, as shown in Figure 18. Again, the weakness of\nthe feature prevents its accurate measurement in many of\nour spectra, but higher resolution and S/N spectra might\nprove this to be an efficient way of producing clean samples of giants or supergiants. We note that the comparison of CN and CO absorption bands provide measurements of surface abundances of CNO-processed elements\nbearing important implications on the internal structure\nand dredge-up history of the objects under study (Carr et\nal. 2000; see also Section 4).\n\n3.7.

(2)), with the most negative values (implying on\nthe average more luminous stars) at the top. The CN\nfeature, marked by the dashed line, has a trend to be\nstronger in the most luminous spectra. The stars plotted here are the ones in our sample for which we measure\n24 < EW [CO(2, 0)] < 25, to remove possible temperature\neffects on the CN bands. However, such trend is not confirmed for the general sample. The bottom panel shows\nthe equivalent width vs. K0 , quantifying the effect hinted\nat by the top panel.\n\nAs discussed in the previous Sections, we have failed to\nfind in our spectra a discontinuity between the properties\nof giants and supergiants allowing a clear discrimination\nbetween both groups. Moreover, very few objects in our\nsample display simultaneously weak or absent H2 O absorption wings and very strong CO(2,0) absorption in the\nrange covered by the supergiants of LW2000, thus suggesting that supergiants with spectroscopic characteristics closely matching those of the local sample are not\nrepresented in large numbers among the stars that we\nobserved. Nevertheless, we do find many stars with NaI\nabsorption similar or greater than those of local supergiants, no signs of H2 O absorption wings, moderate but\nnot extreme CO(6,3) and CO(2,0) absorption, and photometric characteristics that suggest an intrinsic luminosity\nexceeding that of the brightest giants. These properties\nlead us to suspect that our sample does contain a number\nof cool supergiants in the inner Galaxy whose spectroscopic characteristics present systematic differences with\nrespect to local supergiants, being in fact closer to those of\nthe galactic center supergiants, as noted in Section 3.5; see\nalso Section 4.1. Taking together the indicators referred to\nabove, we have produced a list of candidate supergiants\nin the inner Galaxy composed by the stars in our sample\nthat fulfill the following criteria:\n\u2013 I(H2 O) < \u22120.1, denoting the absence of significant H2 O absorption wings. The negative threshold\nis quite restrictive, as weak steam absorption is common among the coolest supergiants (Lan\u00e7on & RoccaVolmerange 1992) and the I(H2 O) values of the typical Mira-like spectra in our sample reach several tenths\nabove zero. As a matter of fact, as many as seven of\nthe LW2000 supergiant spectra would not be considered as supergiant candidates on the grounds of this\ncriterion (see Figure 6).\n\n\f16\n\nF. Comer\u00f3n et al.: A search for late-type supergiants in the inner regions of the Milky Way\n\n\u2013 EW [NaI] > 4 \u00c5, thus selecting as supergiant candidates objects with a NaI feature stronger than that of\nthe coolest giants in metal-rich globular clusters and\nin the solar neighbourhood.\n\u2013 EW [CO(2, 0)] > 19 \u00c5 and EW [CO(6, 3)] > 7 \u00c5. We\nhave already pointed out that these thresholds are well\nbelow the typical strengths of the CO features in the\nlocal supergiants, but they correspond to the values for\nwhich stars with K0 < 0 appear in Figures 16 and 17.\nAs we will discuss in Section 4, the possibility that the\nCO features are systematically weaker among bright\ncool stars in the inner Galaxy makes it advisable to\nuse not-too-restrictive criteria on the CO features.\n\u2013 K0 < \u22120.1, to select stars whose broad-band photometry suggests high luminosity. The usefulness and limitations of K0 as a luminosity indicator have been discussed in Section 3.5, and we stress again here that K0\nis expected to be only loosely correlated with the absolute magnitude. We consider it however as a useful\nadditional indicator of the possible supergiant nature\nof our candidates when used in combination with the\nother criteria described in this Section. The threshold chosen is intended to exclude stars that may have\nbeen placed above the K0 = 0 line by inaccuracies in\nthe photometry.\nThe selection of the best cool supergiant candidates\nobtained through the application of these criteria thus\ncontains 18 objects, listed in Table 3. We have excluded\none object, Star 191, due to its relatively blue (H \u2212 KS ) =\n0.40; as indicated in Section 14 the rough correlation between broad-band colors and luminosity given by Eq. (2)\nmust break down for blue colors indicative of low extinction, and the characteristics of Star 191 are well compatible with those of a lightly reddened, nearby RGB star.\nIt is interesting to note as a validation of these criteria\nthat 7 out of the 8 reddest stars in our sample, which are\nheavily obscured stars but still bright enough to be in our\nsample and are thus good supergiant candidates based on\ntheir photometric properties alone, do fulfill all the spectroscopic criteria as well. Likewise, Star 011, which is the\none that best matches the spectral characteristics of the\nLW2000 sample of M supergiants, is also included in our\nselection as a moderately reddened star and thus probably not very distant, as may be expected from an object\nwhose properties are similar to those of the local sample.\nAs noted above, the criterion based on the almost complete absence of H2 O absorption wings is deliberately conservative, as the coolest local supergiants do show moderate absorption. We thus provide in Table 4 an additional\nlist of M supergiant candidates, with a lower level of confidence than those provided in Table 3, with weak H2 O absorption. Such a table would contain most LW2000 local\nsupergiants as well, although their EW [CO(2, 0)] would\nbe greater on average.\nThe KS magnitudes of most objects in Tables 3 and 4\nand the reddenings implied by their H \u2212 KS are consistent with distances to the Sun placing them well within\n\nthe solar circle given the expected absolute K magnitudes of cool supergiants. However this may not be true\nfor the faintest, most reddened sources in those tables.\nFor instance, assuming MK = \u221211 (which is very bright,\nalthough not unrealistic for a M supergiant; Elias et\nal. 1985) and (H \u2212 KS )0 = 0.3 for Star 072 would place it\nat 17.1 kpc from the galactic center on the opposite side of\nthe solar circle, assuming a galactocentric distance of the\nSun of 8 kpc, and obscured by AV \u2243 35 mag. Nevertheless,\nmost of the other candidate supergiants are both brighter\nat K and less reddened, and the assumption that they\nare indeed located in the inner galactic disk can be expected to be generally valid. This is even more so for the\nRGB stars of our sample, whose absolute magnitudes are\nfainter.\n\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Cool giants and supergiants in the galactic center\nDifferences similar to those that we have discussed in the\nprevious Sections between our sample of cool luminous\nstars and local samples have been already noted in previous works on the galactic bulge, as already discussed in\nSection 3.4, as well as on the galactic center. The latter are\nof particular interest, since they include supergiants in addition to RGB stars. Early infrared investigations of the\nstellar population at the galactic center revealed a high\ndensity of cool, luminous stars including supergiants and\ngiants (Lebofsky et al. 1982; Sellgren et al. 1987). Similar\nto their hotter counterparts, the comparison of properties\nof cool massive stars in the galactic center with similar\nstars in the solar neighbourhood has been the subject of\nintense study to investigate how the widely different environment influences their formation and evolution.\nSellgren et al. (1987; see also Blum et al. 1996) already\nnoted that a number of galactic center giants and supergiants display unusually strong CaI and NaI features when\nobserved at low spectral resolution. Although differences\nbetween galactic center and solar neighbourhood luminous\nstars have been often interpreted as due to the effects of\nmetallicity on stellar evolution, detailed abundance analyses have recently called this into question by showing that\ngalactic center stars have metallicities very close to solar\nvalues (Carr et al. 2000 and references therein; Ram\u0131\u0301rez\net al. 2000a; Blum et al. 2003).\nMost interestingly in the context of our results is\nthe detailed abundance analysis performed by Carr et\nal. (2000) on IRS 7, the brightest M supergiant in the\ngalactic center. While spectroscopy at resolution similar\nto ours also shows strong CaI, NaI features for this star, its\nCO band at 2.293 \u03bcm is found to be significantly weaker\nthan those of the local M supergiants \u03b1 Ori and VV Cep,\nwhose temperatures are very similar to that of IRS 7 as\nshown by model atmosphere fits. The study of Carr et\nal. (2000) reveals a strong surface depletion of C and O and\na corresponding enhancement of N with respect to local\nsupergiants, while the combined abundance of C, N, and\n\n\fF.

Such altered abundances\nnot only explain the weaker CO features (whose strength\nis essentially determined by the C abundance in O-rich atmospheres), but also the unusual strength of the NaI and\nCaI features in low resolution (R \u2243 1000) spectra. Indeed,\nhigh resolution spectroscopy reveals that these atomic features are strongly contaminated by a large number of CN\nbands, which can even dominate the contribution to the\nfeature in the coolest stars (Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. 1997). The enhancement in the surface abundances of CNO-processed\nelements has the net effect of increasing the contribution\nof CN to the observed NaI and CaI features.\nThe interpretation given by Carr et al.

They also suggest that higher rotation\nvelocities on the average, caused by the extreme prevailing\nconditions for star formation, could also explain the differences observed in other classes of high mass stars at the\ngalactic center without requiring metallicities higher than\nsolar. A similar explanation may also apply to the galactic\ncenter giants whose low-resolution spectral properties are\nalso comparable.\nAs noted in Section 3.5, four more bona fide supergiant\ncandidates have been recently identified among ISOGAL\nsources near the galactic center by Schultheis et al. (2003).\nTheir classification as supergiants is based on the estimated absolute magnitude and the absence of water steam\nabsorption. Three of these stars have EW [CO(2, 0)] in the\n20-24 \u00c5 interval, well within the range covered by the su-\n\n\f18\n\nF. Comer\u00f3n et al.: A search for late-type supergiants in the inner regions of the Milky Way\n\npergiant candidates in our sample and also by local RGB\nstars. The fourth one has EW [CO(2, 0)] < 28 \u00c5, which is\nalso well below those of most local supergiants in LW2000\nsample. These results thus support the trend of galactic\ncenter supergiants to have CO bands weaker than those\nof local supergiants.\n\n4.2. Metallicity and systematic differences in feature\nstrengths\nIt is extremely unlikely that an explanation based on rotation such as the one proposed by Carr et al. (2000) can\naccount also for the properties of our inner Galaxy sample, since the formation conditions at distances of a few\nkiloparsecs from the galactic center should be much closer\nto those in the solar neighbourhood and no reason why\nour stars should be faster rotators is apparent. However,\nwe note that the constraint of explaining the peculiar features of galactic center stars while not invoking supersolar\nmetallicity most probably does not apply to our sample,\nwhich populates a region of the galactic disk where the existence of a higher average metallicity is well established\nby a wide variety of tracers; see Chiappini et al. (2001)\nfor an exhaustive summary of galactic abundance gradient determinations for different elements. It is in fact very\ndifficult to disentangle the effects of high metallicity from\nthose of fast rotation on stellar evolution, and in particular\non mixing in the interior of the star, as has been discussed\nby Schaerer (2000).\nThe resemblance between the distinctive properties of\ngalactic center stars and those of our sample (greater\nstrength of the CaI and NaI features, comparative weakness of the K-band CO absorption relative to similar stars\nin the solar neighbourhood) leads us to consider it very\nplausible that the spectroscopic features of many of our\nstars can be explained also by the enhanced abundance\nof CNO-processed material in the stellar surface resulting\nfrom deep mixing, as suggested by Carr et al. (2000) for\nIRS 7 and possibly other galactic center objects. However,\nthe fact that our stars most likely have a higher average\nmetallicity than those of the solar neighbourhood and also\nthose of the galactic center leads us to consider metallicity, rather than rotation, as the reason for the enhanced\nsurface CNO element abundance. Higher metallicity implies higher opacity in the interior of the star, leading to\na deeper penetration of the outer convective zone during\nthe first dredge-up (Vandenberg & Smith 1988, Gratton et\nal. 2000). In turn higher mass loss rates, enhanced by the\nhigher metallicity, may also play a role by efficiently removing the outer envelope and rapidly make visible at the\nsurface deep layers whose composition has been altered by\nCNO reactions (G. Meynet, priv. comm.)\nIn view of our results and the above discussion, we\nrefrain from deriving quantitative properties of our stars\nfrom the available spectroscopic material using extrapolations of relationships calibrated on populations considerably different from ours, such as the metallicity calibration\n\nof Frogel et al. (2001) or the EW [CO(2, 0)]-based temperature scale proposed by Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (1997). We find it\nnecessary to defer a tentative determination of the intrinsic properties of our sample (temperatures, metallicities,\nsurface gravities, absolute luminosities...) to future work\nbased on high resolution spectroscopy, which should allow\nquantitative analyses based on detailed atmosphere and\nstellar evolution models.\n\n5. Summary and conclusions\nIn this paper we have presented the results of a search for\ncool, luminous stars in the inner region of the Milky Way\n(6\u25e6 < l < 21\u25e6 ), selected by the signature of their strong\nCO bandheads longward of \u03bb = 2.293 \u03bcm in narrowband imaging. Low resolution spectroscopy has been presented for 191 stars confirmed to have moderate or strong\nCO bands and other signatures of cool spectra. Some of\nthese stars are readily classified as large-amplitude variable candidates from the appearance of broad H2 O absorption wings. Our spectra also allow the measurement\nof a number of atomic and molecular features in the H\nand K bands. The addition of near-infrared photometry\nfrom 2MASS, which is available for all the stars in our\nsample, allows us to estimate rough luminosities. We find\nthat our sample is dominated by red giant branch stars,\nbut the photometric characteristics of some stars suggests\nluminosities in the range covered by the intrinsically more\nluminous large-amplitude variables, suggesting that they\nare red supergiants. The spectroscopic characteristics are\nconsistent with such classification.\nWe have compared the spectroscopic results obtained\nfor our sample to those derived from the atlas of nearinfrared spectra of cool luminous stars of Lan\u00e7on &\nWood (2000), which is mostly composed of stars in the\nsolar neighbourhood and bulge red giants, as well as to\nthe samples of nearby red giants of Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (1997)\nand bulge giants of Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (2000b). We have also\nmade a comparison to a sample of red giants in globular\nclusters with metallicities in the \u22120.37 < [Fe/H] < \u22120.17\nfrom Frogel et al. (2001). The results of this comparison\nmay be summarized as follows:\n\u2013 The local sample of red supergiants displays spectra\nwith CO bands significantly stronger than those of\nthe stars in the inner Galaxy sample, especially the\nCO(2,0) band. The difference is less pronounced concerning the CO(6,3) band, where there is significant\noverlap between our sample and the local one. We find\nonly one star in our sample whose EW [CO(2, 0)] is\nwell in the range of those of local supergiants.\n\u2013 The CaI and NaI features in the K band are on\nthe average as strong, or even stronger, than those\nof local supergiants. As compared to local and globular cluster RGB stars, most stars in our sample\nhave EW [CaI] and, especially, EW [NaI] well exceeding\nthose of the coolest stars in those samples. However,\nsimilarly strong CaI and NaI features are observed\n\n\fF. Comer\u00f3n et al.: A search for late-type supergiants in the inner regions of the Milky Way\n\namong bulge giants. The net result of this effect and\nthe one described in the previous item is a well defined\nshift of the band defined by our sample in the EW [CaI]\nvs. EW [CO(2, 0)] or the EW [NaI] vs. EW [CO(2, 0)]\nwith respect to the average loci of the reference samples of the solar neighbourhood.\n\u2013 An application of combined photometric and spectroscopic criteria allows us to define a sample of 18\ngood M supergiant candidates having no noticeable\nH2 O absorption, strong CO absorption both in the\nH and K bands, and H, KS photometry similar to\nthat of large amplitude variables, suggesting that they\nare also intrinsically very luminous. Most of them\nare considerably reddened by extinctions reaching up\nAV \u2243 40 mag. Nine additional candidates with weak\nH2 O absorption wings are also identified.\n\u2013 A comparison between the spectroscopic characteristics at low resolution of our best supergiant candidates\nand of the rest of stars in our sample confirms results\nof other authors about the unsuitability of spectra at\nR \u2243 1000 or lower to clearly discern between red giants\nand supergiants, complicated with the interpretation\nof the measurements of the CO and atomic features,\nand in particular the actual species that contribute to\nthe latter.\nThe discussion of our results (Section 4) is centered\non the fact that the low-resolution characteristics noted\nin our sample and summarized above (strong NaI and\nCaI features, probably due to their contamination by CN\nlines, and comparatively weak CO absorption) are shared\nby giants and supergiants in the vicinity of the galactic\ncenter. We have referred to detailed abundance analyses\nby other authors of the galactic center stars, which indicate solar metallicities but altered surface abundances\nof CNO-processed elements with respect to local supergiants, resulting in depleted C and O and enhanced N.\nSystematic differences in rotational velocities, implying\ndeeper mixing in galactic center stars, are invoked to account for the different surface abundances while keeping\na solar metallicity. While we find the ultimate reason of\nsystematic differences in rotation velocities highly implausible to explain the characteristics of our sample, we still\nconsider that deeper mixing and the resulting patterns in\nsurface abundances are an attractive explanation. We propose that higher metallicities in the inner regions of the\nGalaxy are responsible for the deep mixing, probably as a\nconsequence of the increased interior opacity.\nHigher resolution spectroscopy in the infrared (the\nonly spectral region accessible for the study of the photospheres of such heavily reddened objects) will be needed\nto perform detailed abundance analyses as well as to possibly separate giants and supergiants in a more reliable\nway than was possible with the material currently available. Nevertheless, interesting conclusions may already be\ndrawn for the application of the results of our work. On\nthe one hand, we confirm the feature, already suspected\nfrom studies of galactic center stars, that very strong CO\n\n19\n\nabsorption longwards of 2.293 \u03bcm is a distinctive property\nof local supergiants but may not apply to supergiants in\nother environments. On the other hand, the usefulness of\nlocal giants and supergiants as templates for population\nsynthesis studies must be regarded with some caution taking into account our results and the ones referred to on the\ngalactic center. Indeed, common domains of application of\npopulation synthesis are central starbursts and the stellar\nenvironments of AGNs, where the conditions for star formation and evolution may be better represented by those\nin the inner regions or the center of the Milky Way. The\nidentification of a large sample of cool, luminous field stars\nsuch as the one presented in this paper is a necessary first\nstep for the understanding of their physical and chemical\nproperties that may emerge from the combination of future high resolution observations and detailed modelling.\nSuch work will provide a database useful to improve our\nknowledge on the star forming history and chemical evolution of the inner galactic disk in the proximity of the\ngalactic plane, as well as of a variety of extragalactic environments where large scale massive star formation is taking place.\nAcknowledgements.

Representative examples of cool stellar spectra found in our sample. The interval between 1.80 \u03bcm and 2.05 \u03bcm\nis contaminated by strong telluric absorption bands and has been clipped off. The spectra in the top left panel show\nrelatively strong CO absorption bands, but no signs of depression due to the wings of the broad water steam feature\ncentered near 1.9 \u03bcm. The top right panel shows a sample of stars with similarly strong CO, but now also with a\nconspicuous H2 O feature that we classify as large amplitude variables following LW2000. The stars in the bottom set\nof spectra are drawn from the sample of candidate supergiant stars (see Section 3.7). The spectra are normalized to\nthe flux between 2.20 and 2.25 \u03bcm, and the offsets between consecutive spectra are of 0.5 in these normalized flux\nunits.The number accompanying each spectrum refers to the entry number in Table 1.\n\n\f"}
