Thus the small amount of d electron gained by the vacancy formation does\nnot show inter-site correlation, contrary to a recent report [M. Venkatesan et al., Nature 430, 630\n(2004)].\nPACS numbers: 78.70.Dm, 73.20.Hb, 73.61.Ng, 75.70.-i\n\nOxygen vacancy in a large-bandgap oxide changes the\nelectrical characteristics by forming defect states inside\nthe bandgap. Depending on the position and density of\nthe defect energy levels, the chemical potential of the\noxide - frequently identified with the Fermi level (EF )\n- changes as in the case of doping with other atomic\nspecies. Hence, the characterization of the defect level\nis a prerequisite for understanding the electron transfer\nacross the oxide-semiconductor interface, because the energy barrier height at the interface depends on EF of\nthe oxide1,2 . With regard to hafnium oxide, the energy position of this defect level has been estimated\ntheoretically3,4,5 and experimentally6,7 to be above the\nmiddle of the bandgap, so EF is shifted upward in the\npresence of oxygen vacancies. Since EF is determined\nfrom the charge neutrality condition, it is largely influenced by the detailed density of states (DOS) near the\nbandgap1 ; in this case, the intensity of the features near\nthe conduction band (CB) is expected to be higher than\nthose near the valence band (VB).\nRecent density functional theoretical (DFT)\nstudies3,4,5,8,9,10 have revealed that the defect state\nis the localized Hf d state. The nonzero occupation in\nHf d shell is very natural, because Hf atom no longer\ndonates electron to the adjacent vacant sites. If an intersite correlation existed between the d-electrons, even a\nlong-range correlation in the electronic configuration of\neach site might emerge. Surprisingly, room-temperature\nlong range ferromagnetism (FM) was recently reported\nin an oxygen-deficient Hf oxide film11,12,13 , although\nan experimental counter-evidence shows the absence of\nFM14 . Since the measured magnetization is the macroscopic quantity, it might significantly depend on the\npurity of the sample. Furthermore, recent DFT studies\nhave revealed that FM can be induced by a hafnium\nvacancy rather than an oxygen vacancy, while the oxygen\nvacancy can at the most yield paramagnetism15,16,17 .\nThus, it is important to investigate the possible longrange spin order in the oxygen-deficient HfOx<2 from\na microscopic point of view, in that the microscopic\n\nquantities such as the spin or angular momentum drive\nthe macroscopic properties, i.e., the magnetization.\nSince these microscopic values are determined from the\nelectronic structure, the study on the local electron\nconfigurations of each atomic species will provide the\ninformation that is not influenced by a macroscopic\ndeformation (domain interaction, dislocation, etc.) or\nan intervention of impurities.\nTherefore, in this paper, we focus on electron redistribution and the possible long-range spin order in the\npresence of an oxygen vacancy in Hf-oxide by studying\nits electronic structure. To investigate the unoccupied\nelectronic structure of Hf d states, we performed x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study on the HfOx<2 film.\nSince XAS reflects a transition probability from a spatially localized core-level to the unoccupied levels, it is\nsensitive to the unoccupied states originating from the\natoms near the photon-absorbing atom. Further, owing\nto the \"locality\" that allows transitions irrespective of\nmomentum transfer, it reflects the momentum-averaged\nelectronic structure that would be equivalent to the partial density of states (PDOS) in the absence of an electron correlation. We can choose the photon absorber by\ntuning the photon energy range to any of the core-level\nenergies of each atomic species. Using the photon energy\nrange h\u03bd \u223c 530 eV, we can measure O K-edge (1s \u2192 2p)\nabsorption to investigate the O 2p PDOS. Since parts of\nO 2p wavefunctions are hybridized with Hf 5d wavefunctions, O K-edge XAS also shows the unoccupied Hf 5d energy levels that are hybridized with the O wavefunctions.\nThis implies that an Hf d-electron state that stays near\nthe vacant site is hardly observed in O K-edge XAS. The\nsituation is described in Fig. 1. The dashed circle near\nan oxygen atom roughly indicates the probing area of O\nK-edge XAS. However, at Hf N3 -edge (4p3/2 , h\u03bd \u223c 380\neV), we can detect all of the Hf 5d wavefunctions whether\nthe d-electron state is localized near the vacancy or hybridized with the surrounding oxygen atoms (see Figure\n1). Although the obtained spectra become complex due\nto the on-site core-hole effect, this measurement directly\n\n\f2\n\nO\n\nHf\n\nHf\n\nHf\n\nHf\n\nO\n\nHf\n\nHf\n\nHf\n\nHf\n\nHf\n\nHf N3-edge\nO K-edge\nO\n\nO\nHf\n\nHf\nO\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic diagram of the atomic distribution of\nHfOx<2 /Si.

The dashed circles indicate the spatial extent to\nwhich each XAS spectrum could detect the electronic structure. In O K-edge XAS, it is impossible to observe the localized Hf d-electron state near the oxygen vacancy (denoted as\n\"V\"), if it were not for the delocalization of the wavefunctions,\nin contrast to the Hf N3 -edge XAS.\n\nO K-edge XAS\nHfO1.8\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nHf 5d\n2\n\nP\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nP, D, S\n\nS\n\nD, P\n\n2\n\n2\n\nshows the d-occupation at the Hf site.\nThe O K-edge and Hf N3 -edge XASs of the oxygendeficient Hf oxide were performed at the 2A EPU6 beamline of the Pohang Light Source (PLS). In order to determine the existence of a long-range FM spin order, we\nalso performed magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) measurements. The MCD spectrum is the difference between\ntwo XAS spectra measured using external magnetic fields\nof mutually opposite directions. Here, a circularly polarized photon should be used, since the relative orientation of its chirality with respect to the direction of the\nspin moment determines the preference of pumped spins.\nTo align the spin direction, the magnetic field exceeding the coercivity field of the system should be applied.\nThe oxygen-deficient film of \u223c20 \u00c5 was fabricated onto a\nHF-etched Si(100) substrate with a 3 Hz pulsed Nd:YAG\nlaser at a substrate temperature of 700 \u25e6 C. The base\npressure of the growth chamber was 1\u00d710\u22128 Torr and no\noxygen flow was supplied during the film growth. The\noxygen concentration deduced from the intensity ratio of\nO 1s/Hf 4f core-levels in the in situ x-ray photoemission\nspectroscopy (XPS) spectra was approximately 1.8 (i.e.\n10% oxygen deficiency). An approximate estimation of\nthe Hf valence leads to \u223cHf3.6+ , i.e., a composite of 60%\nof Hf4+ and 40% Hf3+ .\nFigure 2 shows the O K-edge XAS spectrum with circularly polarized photons for HfO\u223c1.8 . The overall features of the spectrum are similar to those of the previous experiments for HfO2 18,19,20 as well as the theoretical band calculations for the unoccupied states10,21,22,23 .\nThe spectrum was analyzed using a model cluster calculation with full atomic multiplets24 , assuming the composite [d0 (60%)\u2295d1 (40%)] in a perfect monoclinic crystal\nstructure. As already noted, XAS is relevant to the interactions between the near atoms only; therefore, the\nsingle cluster model with an Hf atom and its nearest\noxygen atoms is sufficient to simulate the XAS spectra.\nThough the Hf oxide film is in an amorphous phase, the\nlocal bonds can be assumed to be similar to those of the\nbulk monoclinic structure25 . The crystal field (CF) split\nenergy ratios were calculated based on the bulk crystal\nstructure, and the overall CF splitting energy was used as\na variable scaling parameter to fit the experimental XAS\nspectra. The one-electron energy level for Hf 5d0 \u2192 5d1\n(empty bars in Fig. 2) is analyzed to be composed of five\nnon-degenerate states: 2 D(xy/x2 \u2212 y 2 ), 2 S(3z 2 \u2212 r2 ),\n2\nP (xz/yz), and two mixed states in the increasing order\nof energy. (Here the coordinate is taken as in Fig. 2.)\nThe intensities of the five d levels are multiplied by the\nHf 5d\u2212O 2p hybridization strength using the Harrison's\nrule (exponent -7 for different interatomic distances)26\nfor the local structure as shown in the figure. The hybridization strength was found to exhibit an anisotropy;\nthe in-planar 2 D state has much weaker hybridization\nstrength than the other levels (\u223c 20% of 2 S and 2 P 's).\nThe 5d1 \u2192 5d2 simulation (filled bars) shows the similar\nresults, except an overall broadening of features due to\nthe atomic multiplets in the d2 final state27 .

The difference spectrum or MCD has no feature,\nindicating no long-range FM spin-order. The results of\nthe atomic cluster model calculations for the composite of\nd0 (60%)\u2295d1 (40%) are also shown in (b).\n\nstoichiometric HfO2 film measured under the same conditions. Both spectra were normalized approximately preserving the total absorption intensity. The spectrum of\noxygen-deficient film appears broader than that of the\nstoichiometric one. We checked the broadness for many\nmeasurement points on each sample and found the consistency for each sample. Thus, the broadness can be\n\nregarded as an intrinsic property of the oxygen-deficient\nfilm. Though no prominent gap state is observed in the\nXAS spectrum of the oxygen-deficient film, the CB edge\nextends toward the bandgap as compared to the stoichiometric one. This can be interpreted as the partial\ndelocalization of the defect state; that is, the defect state\nmight be rather dispersed so that it can also be detected\nat the oxygen site. Thus, the role of the oxygen vacancy\ncan be regarded as donating electron back to the Hf site\nand consequently to the O site through the Hf\u2212O hybridization. In particular, when the vacancy is at the\nHfO2 /Si interface, it is easily substituted by the Si atom\nto form an O\u2212Hf\u2212Si bonding. This could also slightly\nenhance the Hf d occupation, although its amount is reduced due to the electron transfer to the Si site28 . However, the CB tail cannot be attributed to the formation\nof a direct O\u2212Si bonding. This is because the bandgap\nof SiO2 (\u223c9 eV) is much larger than of HfO2 (\u223c5.7 eV);\ntherefore, no structure can exist near the bandgap. We\ncan expect that the bandgaps of any types of the their\nintermediate state, i.e. the silicate (Hfx Siy O4 ) will be\nbetween these two values29,30 , resulting in the absence of\nstates inside the HfO2 bandgap. Therefore, it is evident\nthat the lack of oxygen atom in the oxide or at the interface is responsible for the occurrence of the CB tail\nstate23 .\nIf degree of amorphousness in the Hf-oxide is somehow\nenhanced, this could also extend the CB edge due to the\nbroadening of the features31 . In this case, the tailing\nshould occur in both the VB and CB edges. In the following paragraph, however, we will show that the tailing\ndoes not occur in the VB edge; this manifest that the CB\ntail is truly caused by the physics of defects, not by the\nuncertainty in the lattice dynamics31 .\nTo verify the existence of the band-tails in the occupied\nDOS, we also performed ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) using He\u2212I (h\u03bd = 21.2eV) light source\nfor both the films. (The UPS spectrum for HfO\u223c1.8 is\ntaken from Ref.32 .) The UPS spectra are also normalized with respect to the total intensity. Here, the energy\nzero is arbitrarily chosen to approximately sustain the\nenergy difference between the lowest XAS edge (\u223c+2.5\neV) and the highest UPS main feature (.-3 eV) to be\nthe known bandgap of HfO2 (\u223c5.7 eV; Ref.33 ). The UPS\nspectrum of HfO\u223c1.8 film is shifted by +0.3 eV in order\nto compensate for the EF shift in the oxide, which was\nobtained from the cutoff kinetic energies of the secondary\nelectrons in the spectra (not shown here)32 ; this EF shift\ninduces the higher binding energy (BE) shift in the photoemission spectra, because the BE is, by definition, the\nenergy difference between the Fermi level and the core\nlevel, while XAS is independent of the EF position because the energy difference between the initial core level\nand the final conduction level is independent of the Fermi\nlevel. The large and broad features around the relative\nenergy of -8 \u223c -4 eV correspond to the main O 2p occupied state, while the tail toward the bandgap (shaded\narea at around -3 eV in Fig. 3) probably originates from\n\n\f4\nthe underlying Si wafer34 , because this VB tail is absent\nin the UPS spectra of thicker (> 100 \u00c5) HfO2 film (not\nshown here). A slight increase in the tail in the oxygen\ndeficient film might be a signature of the metallic Hf silicide (Hf\u2212Si bond) at the interface35 . However, the VB\nedge of the oxygen-deficient film does not extend inside\nthe bandgap as compared with that of the stoichiometric\nsample. Though it is difficult to unambiguously analyze\nthese band-tail states in both the occupied and unoccupied DOSs, we can observe that only the unoccupied DOS\nnear the bandgap tends to extend inside the bandgap in\nthe presence of oxygen vacancy10,21 . This result should\nbe correlated with the lifting of Fermi level because the\nvirtual transition to CB becomes easier.\nUp to this point, we have shown experimental evidence\nthat the oxygen vacancy lowers the CB edge and increases\nthe effective Fermi level. The detailed mechanism explaining how the vacancy formation lowers the CB edge\ncould be revealed by a further consideration of the atomic\nrearrangements or the relaxation following the vacancy\nformation. For example, the disorder in the positions of\nthe vacant sites can play a role in broadening the CB DOS\nand consequently in reducing the bandgap. Further, the\nenergy position of the defect level is found to depend on\nthe atomic arrangements after the vacancy formation3 .\nThe reduction in the mean Hf\u2212O bond length (\u223c-0.1\n\u00c5) and in the number of bonds, in the presence of oxygen vacancy32 , will influence the detailed balance in the\ncharge dynamics between the two atomic species. The\nCB lowering can also be correlated with the broadening\nof features influenced by the valence configurations (the\nnumber of electrons) of the remaining atoms, as shown\nin the simulation results in Fig. 2. Further investigation\nis required to completely understand the mechanism.\nNow we check if there be a long-range FM spin order.\nThe Hf N3 -edge XAS spectra obtained with circularly\npolarized photons are shown in Fig. 4(a). The external\nmagnetic field was maintained perpendicular to the sample plane with H = \u00b12500 Oe, which is much larger than\nthe reported ferromagnetic coercivity field of the HfO2\nfilm11 . The difference spectrum, i.e., the MCD spectrum\nexhibits no clear feature and remains zero within the experimental uncertainty. This indicates that there is no Hf\nd-electron-related FM spin order. One would argue that\nthe density of the oxygen vacancy is too small to detect\nFM; however, the value of 10% is larger than the dopant\ndensity in conventional diluted magnetic semiconductors\n(DMS)36 .\nTo analyze the spectral features, we appended in Fig.\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nElectronic address: sjoh@plaza.snu.ac.kr\nP. W. Peacock and J. Robertson, J. Appl. Phys. 92, 4712\n(2002).\nY.-C. Yeo, T.-J. King, and C. Hu, J. Appl. Phys. 92, 7266\n(2002).\nK. Xiong, J. Robertson, M. C. Gibson, and S. J. Clark,\n\n4(b) the simulation result obtained by the full atomic\nmultiplet calculation for Hf N3 -edge XAS (4p3/2 \u2192 5d)\nwith the parameters similar to that of O K-edge XAS,\nexcept the 4p\u2212 5d Coulomb interactions37 . As was in the\nO K-edge XAS simulation, the simulated spectra are obtained by the sum of two transitions: 5d0 \u2192 4p5 5d1 and\n5d1 \u2192 4p5 5d2 . The features of the latter are shifted by\n0\nU \u2212 Fpd\n= \u22122 eV37 with respect to those of the former.\nThe result of the calculation is in an excellent agreement\nwith the experimental spectra; therefore, it provides definite peak assignments; the Hf 4p3/2 \u21925d transition is\nthe largest feature, while the other features in the higher\nphoton energies are attributed to the Hf 4p3/2 \u21926sp transition. Contrary to 2p \u2192 3d transition (as in the case of\ntransition metal ions), the feature of Hf 4p \u2192 5d transition is not much stronger than 4p \u2192 6sp, because of\nits lower photo-absorption cross-sections. The features\nof Hf 6sp for both the edges are denoted by H in Figs.\n2 and 4. The peak positions almost coincide, confirming\nour peak assignments. The simulated MCD signal for Hf\n5d [Fig. 4(b)] is small due to the small anisotropy in the\nunoccupied electron states (d8\u22129 ). Although the sensitivity of the MCD measurement on magnetism is low, no\ncorrelation was observed between the experimental and\nsimulated MCD spectra. This confirms that the small\nmodulation in the experimental spectrum is caused by\nthe noise, not the possible long-range magnetism.\nTherefore, we can conclude that there is no preference\nin spin selection in the electron occupation to either Hf\n5d or 6sp; this evidently proves \"no ferromagnetic spinorder\" in the case of oxygen vacancy. However, the electron occupation number at an Hf site should be nonzero;\notherwise, the electronic configurations of the next nearest O sites, which was shown in O K-edge XAS spectra\n(Fig. 3), should never be influenced by the presence of\noxygen vacancy. Thus, the absence of FM spin-order can\nbe explained by the absence of long-range correlation between the d-electrons in the neighboring Hf sites, rather\nthan the absence of d-electron itself.\nWe conclude our arguments with two remarks: the\noxygen vacancy in Hf oxide slightly enhances the CB\nDOS. However, it does not involve the long-range ferromagnetic spin order in the oxide because of the absence\nof inter-site electron correlation.\nThis study is supported by the Korean Science and\nEngineering Foundation through the Center for Strongly\nCorrelated Materials Research at the Seoul National University, and the experiments at PLS were supported in\npart by MOST and POSTECH.\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nAppl.
