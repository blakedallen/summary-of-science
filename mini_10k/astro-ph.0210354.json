We pay particular attention to the influence of the reionization of the Universe on the number of\nfaint galaxies and to the effects of dynamical friction and tidal limitation of satellites\non the number of bright galaxies. We find substantial differences in the shapes of the\ngalaxy luminosity functions in halos of different mass which reflect generic features of\nthe cold dark matter model of galaxy formation and thus offer the opportunity to test\nit. We then consider how the individual halo luminosity functions combine together to\nproduce the global luminosity function. Surprisingly, the global function ends up having a shallower faint end slope than those of the constituent halo luminosity functions.\nWe compare our model predictions with the limited datasets compiled by Trentham\n& Hodgkin (2002). We find good agreement with the luminosity functions measured\nin the Virgo and Coma clusters but significant disagreement with the luminosity functions measured in the Local Group and Ursa Minor cluster. We speculate on possible\ninadequacies in our modeling and in the existing observational samples. The luminosity functions of galaxies in groups and clusters identified in the 2dF and SDSS galaxy\nredshift surveys offer the prospect of testing galaxy formation models in detail.\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nUnderstanding the galaxy luminosity function has been a\ngoal of galaxy formation theory for several decades (e.g.\nWhite & Rees 1978; Cole 1991; White & Frenk 1991).\nA particularly interesting question is whether the luminosity function is universal or whether it depends on environmental factors such as the mass of the dark halo that hosts\na particular galaxy population. Considerable attention has\nbeen paid to the faint end of the luminosity function which\nhas a much flatter slope than the low mass end of the halo\nmass function predicted in cold dark matter (CDM) models\nof galaxy formation (e.g. Norberg et al. 2002).\nThe early work of White & Rees (1978) showed that\nthe number of faint galaxies must have been strongly affected by feedback processes that prevented most of the gas\nfrom cooling in small halos at early times. Some likely feedback mechanisms, such as the injection of energy into the\ninterstellar medium in the course of stellar evolution, depend on the internal properties of the galaxy and so their\neffects may be expected to be independent of the large-scale\nenvironment. A number of observational studies, such as a\nrecent analysis of the 2dF galaxy redshift survey (De Propris\net al. 2002), indeed find no significant difference between the\nluminosity functions of galaxies in rich clusters and in the\nc 0000 RAS\n\nfield. Other studies, however, have found the opposite. For\nexample, Phillipps & Shanks (1987) concluded that galaxies\nin rich clusters have luminosity functions with considerably\nsteeper faint ends than galaxies in the field. More recently,\nTrentham & Hodgkin (2002) have claimed that the faint\nend of the galaxy luminosity function varies systematically\nwith environment, increasing in slope from small, diffuse systems like the Local Group, to massive, dense systems like the\nComa cluster.\nIn the cold dark matter model of galaxy formation, dark\nmatter halos retain considerable substructure after they collapse and virialize (e.g. Klypin et al. 1999; Moore et al.\n1999) and some of these subhalos are associated with sites\nof galaxy formation. The mass function of subhalos appears\nto be relatively independent of the mass of the parent halo.\nThus, trends such as those inferred by Trentham & Hodgkin\n(2002) would require processes that either preferentially suppress the formation of dwarf galaxies in low mass systems,\nor destroy them after they form. An effective mechanism\nfor suppressing the formation of small galaxies is the reheating of the intergalactic medium (IGM) caused by the\nreionization of the Universe at a redshift z \u2243 6. Tully et al.\n(2002) have argued that this process could introduce an environmental dependence in the galaxy luminosity function\non the grounds that a higher fraction of the low-mass halos\n\n\f2\n\nA. J. Benson, C. S. Frenk, C. M. Baugh, S. Cole & C. G. Lacey\n\nthat formed before reionization (when dwarf galaxy formation proceeded unimpeded by photoionization suppression)\nended up in clusters today than in less massive systems.\nThe effect of reionization on the formation of galaxies has been the subject of several recent studies (Bullock,\nKravtsov & Weinberg 2000; Benson et al. 2002a; Somerville\n2002), aimed mostly at investigating the discrepancy between the large number of subhalos found in N-body simulations of galactic CDM halos and the small number of satellite galaxies observed in the Local Group. In this paper, we\nemploy the CDM model of Benson et al. (2002a) to calculate the luminosity function of galaxy populations residing\nin dark matter halos of different mass. We find that there\nare significant differences in these luminosity functions and\nwe then explore how they combine together to build up the\nglobal luminosity function, with particular emphasis on the\nfaint end slope. A partial study of luminosity functions in\nhalos of different mass using a semi-analytic model of galaxy\nformation was carried out by Diaferio et al. (1999).\nTo calculate galaxy luminosity functions in halos of different mass correctly, it is important to include tidal effects\non satellite galaxies, a potential galaxy destruction mechanism. Our model treats these effects in considerably more\ndetail than previous models of galaxy formation. We find\nthat tidal effects are important in limiting the formation of\nmassive galaxies at the centre of rich clusters.\nIn this paper, we compare the results of our calculations to the data of Trentham & Hodgkin (2002) and assess\nwhether feedback from reionization is a viable explanation\nof the trend claimed by these authors. The existing dataset\nis small, but forthcoming results from the 2dF and Sloan\ngalaxy surveys will enable much more extensive comparisons\nwith the theory.\nThe remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. In\n\u00a72 we briefly outline our model of galaxy formation, in \u00a73\nwe present results for the environmental dependence of the\nluminosity function and in \u00a74 we compare our model with\nthe available observational data. Finally, in \u00a75 we present\nour conclusions. We present, in an Appendix, several simple\nmodels of photoionization suppression to elucidate how this\nmechanism works.\n\n2\n\nMODEL\n\nWe employ the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation\ndescribed in detail by Cole et al. (2000) and Benson et\nal. (2002a; hereafter Paper I) to compute the properties of\ngalaxies in a range of environments at z = 0. The reader\nis referred to those papers for a complete and detailed description of the model. Briefly, the hierarchical formation of\ndark matter halos is calculated using the extended PressSchechter formalism (Press & Schechter 1974; Bower 1991;\nBond et al. 1991). The formation of galaxies in the resulting\ndark matter halo merger trees is followed by means of simple,\nphysically motivated models of gas cooling, star formation\nand galaxy merging. Recent work has demonstrated that at\nleast in so far as gas cooling is concerned these simplified\ncalculations are in excellent agreement with the results of\nN-body/hydrodynamical simulations (Benson et al. 2001;\n\nYoshida et al. 2002; Helly et al. 2002). Applying a stellar population synthesis model gives galaxy luminosities in\ndifferent passbands. The model includes a prescription for\nsupernovae feedback which drives gas out of galaxies at a\nrate proportional to the current star formation rate, with\na constant of proportionality that is larger for less strongly\nbound systems. This negative feedback flattens the faint end\nslope of the luminosity function but, on its own, its effect\nis not strong enough to account for the measured function\n(Paper I). Benson et al. (2002a) developed, and incorporated into this model, a detailed, self-consistent treatment\nof photoionization suppression of galaxy formation (hereafter abbreviated as PhS). By causing further suppression\nof faint galaxy formation, this mechanism brought the model\nluminosity function into excellent agreement with observations. In Paper I, we also included a much more detailed\ntreatment than was previously possible of the evolution of\nsatellite galaxies as they orbit within larger halos experiencing tidal forces and gravitational shock heating. (Hereafter,\nwe abbreviate \"tidal limitation as TiL.) The associated mass\nloss also affects the shape of the luminosity function, and so\nwe will explore this process in this paper.\nWe adopt essentially the same model parameters as in\nPaper I, with the following differences. While the models of\nPaper I used the Press-Schechter halo mass function, we\nchoose to adopt the function proposed by Jenkins et al.\n(2001) which gives a better match to the results of N-body\nsimulations. Consequently, to produce a reasonable galaxy\nluminosity function, we find it necessary to adjust the parameters \u03a9b from 0.020 to 0.024, \u01eb\u22c6 (which determines the\nstar formation rate) from 0.0050 to 0.0067, and \u03a5 (which\naffects mass-to-light ratios) from 1.38 to 1.03 (since \u03a5 affects the fraction of mass recycled in star formation, we adjust that fraction accordingly). Even with these changes, the\nJenkins et al. (2001) mass function results in a somewhat\nworse fit to the bright end of the luminosity function than\nwas obtained in Paper I. We defer further study of this aspect of the model to future work. We adopt an escaping\nfraction of ionizing photons from galaxies, fesc , of 12%. This\nproduces a neutral hydrogen fraction for gas at zero overdensity in the IGM at z = 6 of 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 , in agreement with the\nlower limit of 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 derived by Lidz et al. (2002), while\ncausing reionization to occur at as high a redshift as possible. This maximizes the associated suppression of galaxy\nformation\u22c6 . The resulting model is essentially the same as\nthe fesc = 10% model presented in Paper I.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nTHE GALAXY LUMINOSITY FUNCTION\nLuminosity functions in halos of different mass\n\nWe begin by studying the luminosity functions of galaxies in individual dark matter halos of different mass, and\nthen proceed to consider how these combine together to\n\u22c6 We could increase fesc slightly further without violating the\nlimit of Lidz et al. (2002) but, since the neutral hydrogen fraction\ndrops very rapidly in our model at these redshifts (Paper I), it\nmakes almost no difference to the suppression of galaxy formation.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fEnvironmental Dependence in the Luminosity Function\nform the global galaxy luminosity function. Using the model\ndescribed in \u00a72, we simulate galaxy formation in a large\nnumber of halos of masses 1011 , 1012 , 1013 , 1014 and\n1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 \u2020 . This spans halo masses appropriate to systems ranging from the Local Group to rich galaxy clusters. (The 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 bin corresponds to halos less massive than that of the Local Group but we include it since\nit shows the most dramatic effects.) Merger trees are constructed with a resolution of 10\u22125 of the final halo mass or\n108 h\u22121 M\u2299 , whichever is smaller. This is sufficient to follow\naccurately the formation and evolution of galaxies brighter\nthan MB \u2212 5 log h = \u221210 except in the most massive clusters (1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) for which resolution begins to affect our\nresults faintwards of MB \u2212 5 log h = \u221212; for these clusters, we show results only down to MB \u2212 5 log h = \u221213.\nWe perform calculations for our \"standard model\" (i.e. including the effects of PhS and TiL of satellite galaxies), and\nrepeat them switching off PhS and/or TiL (resulting in a\ntotal of four different sets of results), in order to assess the\neffects of each physical mechanism separately. We simulate\na sufficiently large number of halos of each mass so that the\naverage luminosity functions are reasonably smooth.\nThe solid lines in Figure 1 show the luminosity functions of galaxies in our simulated halos. The basic form of\nthe standard model luminosity function is similar in all mass\nhalos. It has two components: a near power-law distribution\nat faint magnitudes which is made up of satellite galaxies\n(i.e. those galaxies that do not reside at the centre of the final halo), and a strongly peaked distribution at bright magnitudes beyond which no more galaxies are found and which\nis made up of the central galaxy in each final halo. As we\nconsider halos of increasing mass, both components shift to\never brighter luminosities, but the peaked component decreases in amplitude relative to the power-law component,\nindicating that, in low mass halos, a single galaxy tends to\ndominate, while in clusters the light is more equally shared\namong many galaxies.\nObserved luminosity functions, \u03c6(L) = dn/dL (where\nn is the number of galaxies per unit volume and L is luminosity), are typically described by the Schechter function,\n\u03c6(L)dL = \u03c6\u2217\n\n\u0010 L \u0011\u03b1\nL\u2217\n\n\u0010\n\nexp \u2212\n\nL\nL\u2217\n\n\u0011 dL\nL\u2217\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2217 , L\u2217 and \u03b1 are parameters. At magnitudes faint\ncompared to the characteristic luminosity, L\u2217 , has the simple form \u03c6(L) \u221d L\u03b1 . Following normal practice, we will refer to \u03b1 as \"the faint end slope.\" Although the luminosity\nfunctions in Fig. 1 are not well fit by the Schechter form,\nwe can still obtain a formal value of \u03b1 by fitting to the\ndata in the first few bins plotted. We find slopes in the\nrange \u22121.57 < \u03b1 < \u22121.48, except in the lowest mass halos (1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) for which a much flatter slope, \u03b1 = \u22121.06,\nis found (although it is possible that a steeper slope would\nbe obtained also in this case if we probed to even fainter\nluminosities). There is little evidence for a strong variation\nof slope with halo mass, except perhaps for a weak (and\n\u2020 Throughout this paper we write Hubble's constant as H0 =\n100hkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nrather insignificant) trend for flatter slopes in higher mass\nclusters. However, it is important to note that the slope is\nnot constant with galaxy magnitude. This is clearly seen, for\nexample, in the 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 halos for which, in the region\n\u221218 < MB \u2212 5 log h < \u221215, the slope is close to \u03b1 = \u22121.\nSwitching off TiL in our model, and reverting to the simpler calculation of dynamical friction of Cole et al. (2000),\nresults in the dotted curves of Fig. 1. Clearly, TiL has little influence on the faint end of the luminosity function,\nalthough it does slightly reduce the luminosities of already\nfaint galaxies (as is particularly noticeable for 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299\nhalos). A more interesting effect of TiL is apparent in the\nmassive clusters (1014 and 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 halos). Here, switching off TiL results in a new population of very luminous\ngalaxies, visible as a \"bump\" in the luminosity function\nat bright magnitudes. These highly luminous objects form\nthrough multiple mergers at the centres of cluster halos.\nWhen TiL is included, the merger rate of massive galaxies in clusters is significantly reduced, and none of these\nhighly luminous objects form. As shown in the left-hand\npanel of Fig. 2, cluster central galaxies are about an order\nof magnitude less massive when our accurate calculation of\ndynamical friction is used. Note that the inclusion of TiL\nmakes much less difference in 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 halos, due to the\nvery different shape of the luminosity function in these systems (i.e. there is relatively little mass in satellites to merge\ninto the central object). This difference between the merger\nrates in our model and that of Cole et al. (2000) cannot\nbe fully reproduced by simply lengthening the dynamical\nfriction timescale in the Cole et al. (2000) prescription by\nsome factor (even if this factor is a function of halo mass).\nThe shape of the distribution of merger times is significantly\ndifferent between the models and, in our calculation, varies\nwith halo mass.\nAn effect similar to that shown by the comparison of\nthe solid and dotted lines in Fig. 1 was noticed by Springel\net al. (2001) in cluster luminosity functions calculated using\na different semi-analytic model. Springel et al. (2001) computed luminosity functions adopting both simple estimates\nof galaxy merger rates (similar to those assumed in computing the dotted curves in Fig. 1) and merger rates taken\ndirectly from a high resolution simulation of dark matter.\nThey found that the simple scheme produced highly luminous galaxies through merging that were not present in the\nN-body calculation. Based on the number of massive mergers quoted by Springel et al. (2001), we can conclude that a\nsimilar reduction in central galaxy mass occurred when our\nrealistic merger rate calculation was employed. As suggested\nby Springel et al. (2001), the cause of this difference is that\nthe simple scheme underestimates the merging timescale of\nrather massive subhalos in clusters, leading to many massive\ngalaxies merging with the central object in the final halo. In\nour more detailed calculation, as in the N-body simulation,\nthese large subhalos loose a significant amount of their mass\nas they orbit within the cluster, leading to a reduced dynamical friction force and hence to a reduced merger rate.\nThe right-hand panel of Fig. 2 shows the mass functions of surviving substructure halos in clusters at z = 0.\nThe dotted histogram shows the model with no TiL, while\n\n\f4\n\nA.

Each panel shows the mean predicted model luminosity function\nin an ensemble of dark matter halos of mass as given in each panel (ranging from small galaxies to clusters). Specifically, we show the\nmean number of galaxies per magnitude, per halo. Solid lines include photoionization suppression (PhS) and tidal limitation (TiL),\ndotted lines have PhS only, short-dashed lines have TiL only, and long-dashed lines have neither. Open circles show observed luminosity\nfunctions from the compilation of Trentham & Hodgkin (2002), as indicated in the legend of each panel. These have been normalized\narbitrarily to permit easier comparison of their shapes with the models. Filled squares in the 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 panel show the luminosity\nfunction compiled by Benson et al. (2002b), which includes only galaxies classed as lying within the virial radii of the Milky Way's or\nM31's dark halos. The comparison between the model and the observational data is discussed in \u00a74\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fEnvironmental Dependence in the Luminosity Function\nthe dashed histogram corresponds to the model with TiL\nincluded, but the mass of each substructure is plotted as it\nwas before it experienced any tidal mass loss. Clearly, inclusion of TiL has resulted in fewer mergers since there are\nmore surviving substructures of a given initial mass. The\nsolid histogram gives the distribution of substructure masses\nafter tidal mass loss. Comparing the dashed and solid histograms indicates that halos typically lose between 50% to\n70% of their mass (with higher mass halos losing less than\nlower mass halos). The dynamical friction time scales as the\nmass of the satellite halo and is therefore increased by factors of 2 to 3 when TiL is included, greatly reducing the\ngalaxy merger rates.\nSwitching off PhS (short-dashed lines in Fig. 1) has\na more dramatic effect on the luminosity functions than\nswitching off TiL. Firstly, the faint end slope steepens in\nalmost all systems to values in the small range \u22121.71 < \u03b1 <\n\u22121.64. (The exception are the lowest mass halos which have\n\u03b1 = \u22121.38 because of the particularly strong effects of supernovae feedback in these halos.) The increase in the number\nof faint galaxies is more pronounced in lower mass systems.\nIn high-mass systems there is a weak trend for the bright\nend of the luminosity function to be shifted slightly faintwards when PhS is ignored. In this case, more gas is locked\nup in the fainter galaxies, leaving less gas to form massive,\nbright galaxies. In the lowest mass systems the opposite effect occurs and the central galaxies become brighter when\nPhS is ignored. In these 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 halos, PhS suppresses\nthe amount of gas that is able to accrete into the halo, thus\nreducing the luminosity of the associated galaxy. The way\nin which various processes associated with photoionisation\nshape the luminosity function in halos of different mass, particularly its faint end, is discussed in detail in the Appendix.\nThere we also discuss the effect of various approximations\nin the treatment of photoionisation.\nLong-dashed lines show results when both TiL and PhS\nare left out of our calculations. These are essentially accumulations of the effects seen when each process was switched off\nindividually, and result in a further steepening of the faint\nend slopes. In these models, only feedback from supernovae\naffects the faint end of the luminosity function in a manner\nwhich is essentially independent of halo mass.\n\n3.2\n\nThe global luminosity function\n\nWe now explore how the individual halo luminosity functions presented in Section 3.1 combine to produce the global\nluminosity function. An initially surprising aspect of the individual halo luminosity functions is that their faint end\nslopes are, in all cases, steeper than that of the global luminosity function. This, as we showed in Paper I, has a slope\nof around \u22121.2 both in our models and in the real universe.\nHow does PhS contrive to produce a flatter faint end slope\nfor the total population than for any of the constituent individual halos? To understand this behaviour, we must consider the contribution of different mass halos to the global\nluminosity function.\nThe upper panels of Fig. 3 show the contributions to the\nglobal luminosity function from satellite and central galaxc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\nies (left and right-hand panels respectively) residing in halos of different mass. The slope of the combined satellite\nluminosity function reflects the power-law slope of the individual halo luminosity functions and is dominated over a\nwide range of luminosities by halos of 1013 \u20131014 h\u22121 M\u2299 . The\nluminosity function of central galaxies, on the other hand,\nhas a much flatter faint end slope, which is determined by\nthe way in which central galaxy luminosity scales with halo\nmass. In our models, this scaling depends primarily on the\ncombined effects of supernovae and PhS feedback. Since the\ncentral galaxy luminosity functions of individual halos are\nstrongly peaked around a particular luminosity, the global\ncentral galaxy luminosity function is dominated by halos in\na narrow range of mass at each luminosity. (The peak for\ngalaxies in 1010.5 to 1011.5 h\u22121 M\u2299 is much broader, since\nthese mass scales are affected by PhS, causing strong suppression of galaxy formation in the lower mass halos in the\nrange. Figure 1 shows much more clearly the sharply peaked\nluminosity distribution of central galaxies in halos of fixed\nmass.)\nThe lower left-hand panel of Fig. 3 shows how the satellite and central galaxy luminosity functions combine to produce the global luminosity function (which is compared to\nthe recent observational determination from the 2dF galaxy\nredshift survey of Norberg et al. 2002). Brightwards of\nMB \u2212 5 log h \u2248 \u221217, central galaxies dominate, while faintwards of this, the satellite contribution gradually takes over.\nThe faint end slope of the global luminosity function ends up\nbeing intermediate between that of the satellite and central\ngalaxy luminosity functions.\nFinally, in the lower right-hand panel of Fig. 3 we show\nthe contribution to the global luminosity function from halos\nof different mass. Clearly, the faint end slope of the global\nluminosity function is determined in part by the relation\nbetween central galaxy luminosity and halo mass, not just\nby the faint end slopes of the individual halo luminosity\nfunctions. This explains why the global galaxy luminosity\nfunction ends up having a flatter faint end than the individual halo luminosity functions. It is interesting to note that\nboth the total and cluster (i.e. 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 halo) luminosity functions are reasonably well fit by Schechter functions,\nalbeit with slightly different parameters (\u03b1 = \u22121.31/ \u2212 1.45\nand M\u2217 \u2212 5 log h = \u221220.12/ \u2212 19.60 for the total/cluster\nluminosity function; note that the correlation between the\nparameters \u03b1 and M\u2217 should be borne in mind when comparing these values).\n\n4\n\nCOMPARISON WITH OBSERVATIONS\n\nOur model predicts marked differences in the luminosity\nfunctions of galaxy populations residing in halos of different mass. Although the detailed form of these predictions\ndepends on the details of our galaxy formation model, the\ngross differences seen in Fig. 1 are generic predictions that\nbear directly on basic features of the model such as hierarchical clustering from CDM initial conditions, gas cooling, photoionization, feedback, etc. Thus, in principle, individual halo luminosity functions provide a strong test of\n\n\f6\n\nA.

Unfortunately, implementing such a test in practice is difficult because of the observational complications inherent in identifying galaxies attached to a particular dark matter halo. Gravitational lensing is a powerful and promising tool for detecting dark matter halos directly, but this technique is still in early stages\nof development (e.g. Mellier 2002). A less direct, but still\nuseful approach, consists of finding groups and clusters in\nlarge redshift catalogues such as the 2dF and SDSS surveys.\nWhen interpreted with the aid of cosmological simulations,\nit is possible to go some way towards identifying galaxy populations likely to be associated with single halos (and their\nsubhalos) of a given mass (Eke et al. 2002). This approach\nwill yield interesting data for comparison with our model\npredictions in the near future.\nIn the interim, Trentham & Hodgkin (2002) have provided a limited compilation of observational data. They give\nestimates of the B-band luminosity functions of galaxies in\nthe Local Group and in the Ursa Major, Virgo and Coma\nclusters. In our model, these systems are expected to reside in halos of mass similar to those we have simulated,\ni.e. 1012 , 1013 , 1014 and 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 respectively (Benson et\nal. 2002a; Trentham & Hodgkin 2002; Schindler, Binggeli\n& B\u00f6hringer 1999; Geller, Diaferio & Kurtz 1999). We\nshow Trentham & Hodgkin's (2002) compilation in Fig. 1\nas open circles. The vertical normalization of the datasets\nhave been adjusted arbitrarily to permit an easier comparison of the shapes and faint end slopes of the model and\nobserved luminosity functions. For the two most massive\nsystems in the figure, our standard model is in reasonably\ngood agreement with the observed luminosity function, in-\n\ncluding the faint end slope, but for Ursa Major and the Local Group, the observations indicate a much shallower slope\nthan is produced by our model. The same discrepancy was\nnoted by Benson et al. (2002b) for the Local Group, and\nis also apparent in the predicted Local Group luminosity\nfunction of Somerville (2002) (which has \u03b1 \u2248 \u22121.5 over the\nrange \u221220 < MV \u2212 5 log h70 < \u221210, where h70 is the Hubble\nconstant in units of 70km/s/Mpc, for the case of reionization at z = 8 which is the closest to our own calculations),\nsuggesting that this is a rather robust prediction of PhS.\nIn making the comparison between theory and observations in Fig. 1, one should keep in mind the possibility that\nthe two may not correspond to quite the same quantity.\nThe theoretical predictions pertain to luminosity functions\nof galaxy populations residing in individual dark matter halos of a given mass. However, there is no guarantee that\nthe samples selected by Trentham & Hodgkin (2002) do indeed come from individual dark matter halos. For example,\nthese samples might be contaminated by contributions from\nsecondary halos which happen to be nearby the dominant\nhalo. This could be particularly important for the Ursa Major cluster which is a rather diffuse object and is too large,\ngiven its mass, to be associated with a single, virialized halo\n(according to the standard theoretical definitions). There\nare ambiguities regarding the Local Group data as well. As\nargued by Benson et al. (2002b), many dwarfs nominally associated with the Local Group lie beyond the region which,\naccording to our model, contains the (distinct, but similar\nmass) halos of the Milky Way and M31. In Fig. 1, we show\nas filled squares the luminosity function of the galaxies that\nBenson et al.

Nevertheless, selection effects such as these must be accounted for in a more thorough\ncomparison of theory and observations.\nThe results of Fig. 1 are shown in a different way\nin Fig. 4 which more clearly shows the variation in the\nshapes of the luminosity functions at different luminosities. Here, we plot the effective luminosity function slope,\n\u03b1eff = L(d2 N/dL2 )/(dN/dL), as a function of absolute\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nmagnitude for all the systems we have simulated. (For clarity, we show results only for our standard model and for a\nmodel with both PhS and TiL switched off.) The luminosity\nfunctions with no PhS or TiL in 1013 and 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 halos show an extended region where \u03b1eff is almost constant,\nindicating a power-law luminosity function. With PhS and\nTiL switched on, the slope is shallower, but the luminosity\nfunction is no longer a power-law over an appreciable range\nof magnitudes. For the other mass systems, the luminosity\n\n\f8\n\nA. J. Benson, C. S. Frenk, C. M. Baugh, S. Cole & C. G. Lacey\n\nfunction is nowhere well described by a power-law and, in\nevery case, the inclusion of PhS makes the slope shallower,\nthe effect being larger in the lower mass systems.\nTrentham & Hodgkin (2002) characterized variations in\nluminosity function shapes using the \"dwarf-to-giant ratio\"\n(i.e. the number of galaxies in some range of faint magnitudes relative to the number at brighter magnitudes). We\ncompute a similar ratio for our model with PhS and TiL\nand present the results in Table 1. (We use a slightly different magnitude range for the dwarfs because, for our most\nmassive halos, our model is not complete over the range of\nmagnitudes used by Trentham & Hodgkin.)\nFor the two most massive systems, our model results are\nin reasonably good accord with the observational determinations, but for the lower mass systems there are significant\ndiscrepancies. This analysis verifies and quantifies the comparison between the shapes of the predicted and observed\nluminosity functions made in Fig. 1.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nUsing a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, we have\ncalculated the luminosity function of galaxy populations\ncontained in halos of different mass. We find large differences in the shapes of these luminosity functions. In smaller\nmass halos (M \u223c\n<1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 ), the luminosity function has\na \"hump\" at bright magnitudes and a roughly power-law\nshape at fainter magnitudes. In more massive systems, the\nshape approaches the familiar Schechter form. These differences reflect the relative contributions of \"central\" and\n\"satellite\" galaxies. In the smaller mass halos, the bright\nend of the luminosity function is dominated by a single or\nat most a few bright galaxies and the rest of the population consists predominantly of much fainter satellites. In\nthe more massive halos, the light is more evenly distributed\namongst a large number of galaxies. These differences reflect\nthe complex interplay between the processes that establish\nthe number of halos and subhalos of different mass (i.e. hierarchical clustering from CDM initial conditions) and the\nprocesses that light them up (i.e. gas cooling, stellar evolution, feedback, etc).\nThe global luminosity function is the weighted sum of\nthe luminosity functions of individual halos. Interestingly,\nthe faint end slopes of the individual luminosity functions\nare always steeper than the faint end slope of the global luminosity function. This can be understood in terms of the\nrelative contributions to the global luminosity function of\nsatellite and central galaxies from individual halos, whose\nluminosity functions have steep and shallow slopes respectively. The slope of the global function is intermediate between these two.\nOur model of galaxy formation represents an advance\nover previous models because of its detailed treatment of two\nprocesses that are important in establishing the luminosity\nfunction: the suppression of galaxy formation in small halos at high redshift (PhS), as a result of the photoionization\nof the IGM by early generations of galaxies and quasars,\nand tidal mass loss from satellite galaxies (TiL). PhS is\n\nparticularly relevant at the faint end and has the net effect of reducing the number of faint galaxies, giving rise to\na flatter luminosity function than would otherwise be the\ncase. This outcome is far from obvious. For example, a simplistic model of PhS in which galaxy formation is assumed\nnot to occur in low mass halos below the reionization redshift results, in fact, in a steeper luminosity function (see\nAppendix A). In reality, the effects of PhS depend on the\nmass of the halo relative to the time-dependent \"filtering\nmass\" (defined as the halo mass which accretes only half\nthe mass that it would have accreted in the absence of photoionization; Gnedin 2000). Galaxies can form even if their\nhalos have mass smaller than the filtering mass, but with\nreduced luminosity. The lower the mass of the halo relative\nto the filtering mass, the fainter is the galaxy that forms.\nThe filtering mass is an increasing function of time. Thus,\nalthough lower mass halos form at higher redshift, the redshift where the filtering mass becomes comparable to their\nmass is also higher, increasing the fraction of them which\nexperience strong suppression. These two effects combined\ndo tend to produce a flatter luminosity function but the degree of flattening depends on their detailed balance\u2021 . As we\nhave shown previously (Benson et al. 2002a; see also Benson et al. 2002b), PhS on its own cannot account for the\nshallow faint end slope of the global luminosity function.\nOther processes, such as feedback from energy released by\nstellar winds and supernovae, need to be included in order\nto reduce the number of faint galaxies to the observed level.\nThe other process that we have treated in detail, TiL,\nis relevant at the bright end of the luminosity function, particularly in massive halos harbouring rich clusters. Mass loss\nfrom satellite galaxies, as they spiral into the centre of their\nhalo, increases the dynamical friction time, so reducing the\nmerger rate. This prevents the formation of some of the\nhighly luminous and unobserved cluster galaxies that tend\nto appear in models of galaxy formation that do not take\nthis process into account.\nKeeping in mind the provisos of \u00a74, we find that our\nmodel fails to reproduce the steepening of the faint end\nslope of the luminosity function with system richness found\nby (Trentham & Hodgkin 2002). The model agrees quite\nwell with the data for the Virgo and Coma clusters, but it\npredicts a steeper faint end than is inferred for the Local\nGroup and Ursa Minor. Photoionization is an effective (and\nunavoidable) mechanism for suppressing galaxy formation in\nlow mass halos, but it does not produce the kind of \"environmental\" variation seen by Trentham & Hodgkin (2002).\nAt the low mass end, this failure of the model is related\nto the discrepancy that we (Benson et al. 2002b, see also\nSomerville 2002), found previously in our CDM models of\nthe Local Group. Photoionization has a dramatic effect on\nthe overall number of satellites that survive in galactic halos and can reduce it to the levels seen in the Local Group.\nHowever, the satellite luminosity function in the models is\n\n\u2021 A model in which a cut-off in circular velocity rather than mass\nis assumed gives results in quite good agreement with our detailed\ncalculations (Benson et al. 2002a).\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fEnvironmental Dependence in the Luminosity Function\n\n9\n\nFigure 4.

This discrepancy contrasts with the success of CDM models in reproducing the\nstructural properties of the satellites (Stoehr et al. 2002).\nTaking at the face value the discrepancy between our\nmodels and the data of Trentham & Hodgkin (2002), it is interesting to speculate about the possible root causes of the\nproblem. Leaving aside alternative theories for the nature\nof the dark matter or drastic changes to the initial power\nspectrum of density perturbations specifically designed to\nreduce the amount of small-scale power (e.g. Col\u0131\u0301n, AvilaReese & Valenzuela 2000; Kamionkowski & Liddle 2000),\nwe focus on our modeling of baryonic processes within the\ncontext of the CDM cosmogony. This is undoubtedly simplified. For example, the effects of PhS depend upon both\nthe time variation of the filtering mass and on the assumed\nfunctional form of the suppression, both of which are uncertain. As discussed in the Appendix, reasonable variations\nin our assumed mass dependence of PhS do not seem capable of producing a sufficiently flat faint end slope in our\nmodels of the Local Group. However, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that the simplifications made in our model are\ninappropriate. For example, we neglect the patchy nature of\nreionization, but if low density regions became ionized first,\ngalaxy formation would be suppressed more effectively in\nthese regions, altering the temporal evolution of the filtering mass. Localized PhS triggered, for example, by a nearby\ngalaxy or quasar could also change our model predictions.\nThese processes are poorly understood theoretically, but observational evidence (e.g. Adelberger et al. 2002) suggests\nthat they could be important in determining the thermodynamic state of the IGM at high redshift.\nAt a more basic level, there are approximations in\nour model which might be inappropriate in the regime\nof low mass halos. Thus, although comparisons with Nbody/hydrodynamical simulations indicate that our estimates of gas cooling rates are accurate for relatively massive\ngalaxies (Benson et al. 2001; Yoshida et al. 2002; Helly et\nal. 2002), it has not been shown that the same is also true\nfor the low mass galaxies of interest here. Cooling times in\nthese objects can become very short and this might conceivably render incorrect the assumption of cooling from an\ninitial, spherically symmetric quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium.\nFurther study of gas cooling in low mass systems is necessary to address this issue. Similarly, it is far from clear that\nthe simple rules for star formation in our model, which are\nempirical parameterizations tuned to match observational\nconstraints for relatively bright galaxies at low redshifts, re-\n\nmain valid when extrapolated to low mass galaxies and/or\nhigh redshifts. Other physical constraints on star formation\nnot currently included in our models may also be important for these low mass galaxies (e.g. Verde, Oh & Jimenez\n2002). Finally, our modeling of feedback is also simplified\nand, again, its extrapolation to low masses may be unrealistic. Possible sources of feedback such as strong outflows\nor heating by AGN which are currently neglected may be\nimportant on these scales.\nIn conclusion, we have found substantial differences in\nthe luminosity functions of galaxies residing in dark matter\nhalos of different mass. These result from the interplay of a\nvariety of processes that affect the formation of galaxies of\ndifferent luminosity. Although the exact predictions of our\nmodel no doubt depend on its details, the gross differences\nbetween the predicted luminosity functions are likely to be\ngeneric and to be present in a broad class of cold dark matter models of galaxy formation. Comparison with existing\ndata gives mixed results: fair agreement with the luminosity\nfunctions in Virgo and Coma but substantial disagreement\nwith the luminosity functions in the Local Group and Ursa\nMinor cluster. The much larger and better controlled samples that will be forthcoming from cluster analyses of the\n2dF and SDSS galaxy redshift surveys will allow a more\ncomprehensive test of the general class of cold dark matter\nmodels of galaxy formation.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nREFERENCES\nAdelberger K.

The two sources of feedback in\nour model, supernova-driven winds and photoionization, are\nboth important in determining the number of faint galaxies. As we discussed in Paper I, photoionization inhibits the\nformation of faint galaxies for two reasons: it raises the temperature and pressure of the IGM, curtailing the ability of\ngas to accrete into halos, and it reduces the rate at which\ngas in halos can cool, inhibiting star formation. The first\nof these processes is the dominant effect. It can be conveniently described in terms of a \"filtering mass,\" MF , defined\nas the mass of a halo which accretes only half the baryonic\nmass that it would have accreted in the absence of photoionization. The mass of gas accreted by a halo of mass Mh\nis approximated by the following formula (Gnedin 2000),\nbased on the results of gas-dynamical simulations:\nMgas =\n\nfb Mh\n,\n[1 + (21/3 \u2212 1)MF /Mh ]3\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n(A1)\n\n11\n\nwhere fb is the universal baryon fraction and MF is the\nfiltering mass.\nThere are three different aspects to consider when evaluating the effect of the filtering mass on the faint end slope\nof the luminosity function:\n(i) Galaxy formation is significantly suppressed in halos\nless massive than the filtering mass.\n(ii) The filtering mass is an increasing function of time\n(at least over the range of redshifts of interest here).\n(iii) For halos formed at a given redshift, the suppression\nof galaxy formation is greater the smaller the halo mass is\nrelative to the filtering mass.\nThe impact of these three factors will depend on the\ndistribution of formation redshifts of dark matter halos of\ndifferent mass in different environments\u00a7 . According to the\nextended Press-Schechter formalism, it is always true (for a\nCDM power spectrum) that the typical formation redshift of\na halo increases as the mass of the halo decreases, and also as\nthe mass of the final host in which the halo resides increases.\nFurther understanding of halo formation redshift distributions may be gained by considering eqn. 2.15 of Lacey &\nCole (1993) that gives the mass function of progenitor halos\nat any redshift and which we reproduce in slightly different\nform below:\ndN\n(z)\ndM\n\n(z)\n\n=\n\n(0)\n\n(\u03b4c \u2212 \u03b4c )\n1 Mhost\n\u221a\n2 (M ) \u2212 \u03c3 2 (M\n3/2\nM\n[\u03c3\n2\u03c0\nhost )]\n\n\u0012\n\n(z)\n\n(0)\n\n(\u03b4c \u2212 \u03b4c )2\nexp \u2212\n2\n2[\u03c3 (M ) \u2212 \u03c3 2 (Mhost )]\n\n\u0013\n\nd\u03c3 2\n,\ndM\n\n(A2)\n\n(z)\n\nwhere \u03b4c is the critical value of the linear theory fractional\noverdensity for collapse at redshift z, M is the mass of the\nprogenitor halo at that redshift, \u03c3 2 (M ) is the variance of\nthe linear fractional overdensity in a sphere of mass M , and\nMhost is the mass of the halo into which that progenitor has\nbeen incorporated by the present day.\nConsider galaxies living in relatively low mass halos at\nthe present day (in which most of the galaxies that make\nup the faint end of the luminosity function reside). The relative numbers of halos of masses M1 and M2 (< M1 ) at\nsome particular redshift depends upon \u03c3 2 (M1 ) \u2212 \u03c3 2 (Mhost )\nand \u03c3 2 (M2 ) \u2212 \u03c3 2 (Mhost ). As Mhost increases, \u03c3 2 (Mhost ) decreases for a CDM power spectrum. Thus, for sufficiently\nlarge Mhost , the relative numbers of halos of masses M1 and\nM2 tends to a fixed value. For Mhost comparable to M1 ,\nthe relative numbers of these halos become a very strong\nfunction of Mhost , and the number of mass M1 halos is exponentially suppressed, as indicated by eqn. (A2).\nThese theoretical expectations are clearly manifest in\nFig. A1, where we plot the positions of galaxies in the\nhalo-mass vs. formation-redshift plane. All of the galaxies\nwe consider at z = 0 are satellites in a larger host halo\n(of mass Mhost ) due to the ranges of luminosity and Mhost\nwe have chosen to consider. Therefore, we plot the formation redshift and mass for the halo in which the satellite\n\u00a7 By \"environment\" we mean the mass of the halos into which\nthat earlier halo has been incorporated by the present day.\n\n\f12\n\nA. J. Benson, C. S. Frenk, C. M. Baugh, S. Cole & C. G. Lacey\n\nformed. We adopt the definition of formation redshift of\nCole et al. (2000), namely a halo is assumed to be newly\nformed if its mass exceeds twice the mass of each of its\nprogenitors at their own formation time, and plot the halo\nmass at the formation redshift (it may have increased afterwards due to continued accretion and merging). (The formation redshifts appear quantized in this figure because of\nthe finite timesteps in our calculations which, however, are\nsufficiently fine so as not to affect the results.) The halo\nmass of the satellite is then set equal to the mass of the\nhalo in which it lived at redshift zform ). The position of a\nhalo in this plane, relative to the redshift-dependent filtering mass (shown as a solid curve), determines the degree\nof PhS it experiences. We examine faint galaxies in two luminosity ranges, \u221213 < MB \u2212 5 log h < \u221212 (dots) and\n\u221215 < MB \u2212 5 log h < \u221214 (small squares).\nConsider first a model with no PhS (left-hand panels).\nIn this case, faint galaxies currently hosted in a 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299\ncluster halo (lower panel) have a much more extended range\nof formation redshifts than galaxies in a 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 Milky\nWay-type halo (upper panel). The fainter galaxies located\nin lower mass halos have a more extended range of formation redshifts than their brighter counterparts, although this\ndifference is rather small. The values of \u03b1 for the two populations, given in each panel, indicate steep slopes in both\nenvironments. The filtering mass has no influence on these\nresults, of course, but is shown to indicate which of halos might be expected to still form a galaxy when PhS is\nswitched on.\nIn the right-hand panels we plot results for a model with\nPhS. The effect of the filtering mass can now be clearly seen:\nhalos below the solid line form galaxies much less efficiently\nthan before (although there are certainly still some halos\nthat managed to make galaxies below this line). The values\nof \u03b1 given in the panels indicate that some flattening of the\nluminosity function has occurred, but this effect is small.\nLet us now examine the importance of these various\nprocesses using simplified models of PhS. Figure A2 shows\nluminosity functions in different mass halos constructed using the simplified models described below, together with our\nstandard model of PhS (heavy solid line) and a model with\nno PhS (thin solid line).\nModel A In the simplest scenario, suppose the filtering\nmass jumps abruptly from zero to MF at redshift zreion ,\nand that any halo of smaller mass forming at lower redshift\nmakes no galaxy at all, while galaxy formation in other halos proceeds unchanged. In this case, the luminosity function should be unaffected at bright magnitudes (since these\ngalaxies form in halos which are more massive than MF ),\nshould plummet sharply at a magnitude corresponding to\nhalo mass equal to MF , and should rise again to fainter\nmagnitudes (since these galaxies inhabit lower mass halos\nwhich typically form at redshifts greater than zreion ). On\nthe basis of eqn. (A2), the slope of this rise should be large\nfor low Mhost halos since these have the greatest variation in\nprogenitor number with mass at zreion , and should approach\nsome fixed value for large Mhost . This behaviour is borne out\nwhen we apply this simple prescription to our semi-analytic\nmodels, using values of MF = 3 \u00d7 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 (compara-\n\nble to the value of MF at the redshifts where the majority of the faint galaxies are formed in our standard model)\nand zreion = 6.5 (the redshift of reionization in our standard model; dot-long-dashed lines in Fig. A2)-suppression\nis greatest for small Mhost , tends to steepen the faint end\nof the luminosity function, and causes the most steepening\nfor the lowest Mhost . This model produces a discontinuity in\nthe luminosity function and is a poor approximation to the\nfull treatment.\nModel B At the next level of sophistication, we take into\naccount the variation of the filtering mass with redshift as\npredicted by our model, but retain the simple prescription\nwherein any halo forming with mass below the filtering mass\nforms no galaxy at all. Since MF increases with time, galaxy\nformation in lower mass halos is suppressed earlier, an effect which should tend to flatten luminosity function slopes.\nSince halos of a given mass form earlier in larger Mhost ,\nwe still expect the effects of filtering to be weaker for clusters than for the Local Group. At a given magnitude, this\nprocess would simply reduce the number of galaxies. However, the detailed consequences for the faint end slope are\nnow harder to anticipate since they depend on just how MF\nvaries with redshift. Applying this prescription to our model\n(long-dashed lines in Fig. A2), we still find a discontinuity in\nthe luminosity function (although this is much weaker than\nin model (i) since MF varies smoothly with time) which is\nflattened relative to that without any PhS. Furthermore, the\nslopes are significantly flatter than in case (i), indicating that\nthe time variation of MF largely counteracts the steepening\nof the luminosity function produced by the variation in halo\nformation distributions. No environmental variation is introduced by these processes. The resulting luminosity functions\nare quite similar to those from our full PhS calculations, although the level of suppression is somewhat greater. Again,\nthe effects are largest for the lowest Mhost .\nModel C Alternatively, we can consider a prescription\nwhich has no time variation in MF , but in which, instead,\nthe degree of suppression varies smoothly with halo mass (as\nprescribed by Gnedin 2000)\u00b6 . We find that this model also\nproduces luminosity functions similar to those from our full\nPhS calculations (dot-short-dashed lines), and with about\nthe right degree of suppression for suitable choices of MF\nand zreion .\nModel D We next consider a model in which MF varies\nwith time and in which the degree of suppression varies\nsmoothly with halo mass. This then differs from our full\nPhS calculations only in neglecting suppression due to photoheating by the ionizing background. In this model, photoionization redistributes galaxies which previously had a\ngiven magnitude over a range of fainter magnitudes. At a\ngiven magnitude, some galaxies are lost due to suppression,\nbut also new ones appear as brighter galaxies are partially\n\u00b6 Somerville (2002) considered a similar model, but kept the\ncircular velocity corresponding to MF constant, resulting in a\nfiltering mass that increased with time. This prescription, also\nadopted by Bullock, Kravtsov & Weinberg (2000) provides a\nbetter match to the results of our standard model. Here, however,\nwe are intersted only in exploring simplified models.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fEnvironmental Dependence in the Luminosity Function\n\n13\n\nFigure A1.

The net effect is therefore difficult to judge since it depends on the time variation\nof the filtering mass and on the previous shape of the luminosity function. We can, however, safely say that the effect\nis still expected to be larger for lower Mhost . Applying this\nprescription we reproduce the results of our full PhS calculation rather well (dotted lines in Fig. A2), finding slightly\nless suppression overall than in case (ii), but still with no\nenvironmental variation.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nModel E A smoother variation of suppression with halo\nmass would result in less flattening of the faint end slope.\nFor example, the short-dashed lines in Fig. A2 show results\nfor a suppression of the form\nMgas =\n\nfb Mh\n,\n1 + MF /Mh\n\n(A3)\n\nwith the same variation of filtering mass with redshift as in\nour standard model.\n\n\f14\n\nA.

Each panel shows the mean predicted model luminosity\nfunction in an ensemble of dark matter halos of mass given in each panel (ranging from halos containing small galaxies to rich clusters).\nAll models include the effects of tidal limitation. The heavy solid lines show results from our complete model of PhS, while thin solid\nlines show a model with no PhS. Dot-long dashed lines have a filtering mass which jumps abruptly from zero to 3 \u00d7 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 at\nz = 6.5 and a sharp suppression at that mass at lower redshifts (Model A). Long-dashed lines have time varying filtering mass, but a\nsharp suppression at that mass (Model B). The dot-short dashed line shows a model with a fixed filtering mass but a smooth variation\nof suppression with halo mass (Model C). Dotted lines are a simplified model with time-varying filtering mass and a smooth variation\nof suppression with halo mass (Model D). Short-dashed lines are the same, but with an extra-smooth variation of suppression with halo\nmass (Model E).\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fEnvironmental Dependence in the Luminosity Function\nIn conclusion, a simple model in which galaxy formation\nat z < zreion is entirely suppressed below some fixed mass\nscale grossly overestimates the effects of PhS, and produces\nvery different luminosity functions from those predicted by\nour full calculation. Including either a smoothly varying degree of suppression or a time-varying filtering mass produces\nbetter agreement with our full calculations, indicating that\nthese two ingredients are of comparable importance. The\ndegree of suppression (as characterised by the reduction in\namplitude of the LF) for a given time dependence in MF depends on the functional form used to characterize the variation of suppression with halo mass. The sharper the transition from weak to strong suppression, the greater the net\neffect on the luminosity function. Smoother transitions tend\nto produce steeper faint end slopes, but even the sharpest\ntransition possible does not produce slopes as flat as are\nobserved and we never find any significant environmental\nvariation.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n15\n\n\f"}
