Their\napplication to the study of young massive clusters is of more recent origin, having begun in earnest with the classic study of ten rich, 8 \u2013 300 Myr old clusters\nin the LMC by Elson, Fall, & Freeman (1987, hereafter EFF87). As this study\ndemonstrated, the luminosity profiles of YMCs differ significantly and systematically from those of old globulars. The observed differences contain important\nclues concerning the formation and dynamical evolution of massive star clusters.\nAmong the various motivations for studying luminosity profiles (hereafter\nLPs) of YMCs is our desire to understand the effects of mass segregation as\na function of time and to separate any possible primordial mass segregation\nfrom the longer-term segregation caused by energy equipartition. Young massive\nclusters offer two main advantages: They still contain stars over most of the mass\nrange of \u223c0.1 \u2013 120 M\u2299 , and they allow us to trace evolutionary effects directly\nas a function of cluster age.\nLuminosity profiles can also yield information on core collapse, both slow\nand fast (\"equipartition instability,\" Spitzer 1969), and on the possible formation\nof central black holes in clusters. Finally, such profiles can help us evaluate the\nimpact of mass loss on cluster formation and disruption, yielding estimates of\nthe fraction of field stars that may have originated in clusters.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSchweizer\n\nFigure 1.\n(a) (left) Family of King profiles (solid lines, c = 1 \u2013 2.95)\ncompared with Gaussian (dotted line) and modified Hubble profile (dashed,\nfrom Carlson & Holtzman 2001). King profiles fit old globular clusters well.\n(b) (right) Surface-brightness measurements for 130 Myr-old LMC cluster\nNGC 1866 (data points) compared with King profiles (solid curves) and bestfit EFF profile (dashed). The EFF profile fits the young-cluster profile with\nits power-law envelope best (from Lupton et al. 1989).\n\n2.\n\nLuminosity Profiles: Basics\n\nWe are all familiar with King (1966) model profiles, shown in Fig. 1a, which fit\nthe LPs of old globular clusters better than Gaussian or modified Hubble profiles\ndo. King profiles are derived from model clusters with equal-mass stars and\ntruncated Maxwellian velocity distributions (\"lowered isothermal models\"), and\nare characterized by three parameters: I0 , rc , and rt (central surface brightness,\ncore radius, and tidal radius). The concentration index, c \u2261 log rc /rt , is a\nmeasure of how strongly tidal truncation has affected the cluster.\nAs EFF87 first showed and Elson (1991) further demonstrated, young massive clusters in the LMC feature power-law envelopes and are well fit by model\nprofiles of the form I(r) = I0 (1 + r 2 /a2 )\u2212\u03b3/2 , much better so than by King\nprofiles. At radii r \u226b a, these EFF profiles take the simple power-law form\nI(r) \u223c r \u2212\u03b3 . Like the King profiles, they are characterized by three parameters:\nI0 , a, and \u03b3 (central surface brightness, characteristic radius, and power-law\nslope). The characteristic radius a is related to the core (= half-central-surfacebrightness) radius rc through rc = a(22/\u03b3 \u2212 1)1/2 . Figure 1b illustrates that\nthe 130 Myr-old LMC cluster NGC 1866 is, indeed, better fit by an EFF model\nprofile than by King profiles (EFF87; Lupton et al. 1989).\nIn trying to understand cluster dynamics, three characteristic time scales\nare important (e.g., Spitzer 1987; Meylan 2003): (1) the crossing time tcr during\nwhich a star typically crosses the system; (2) the half-mass relaxation time trh\nduring which stellar encounters redistribute energies to the point of setting up\na near-Maxwellian velocity distribution within the half-mass radius; and (3) the\nevolution time tev , which is the time it takes for slow dynamical processes like\nthe evaporation of stars from the cluster to significantly change the cluster size\nand profile. It has long been known that for globular clusters tcr \u226a trh \u226a tev ,\n\n\fLuminosity Profiles of Resolved YMCs\n\n3\n\nFigure 2.\nApparent radii of a typical Milky-Way globular cluster at different hypothetical distances. Sloping lines mark the radii rc , reff (dashed), and\nrt .\n\nwith typical values of tcr \u2248 106 yr, trh \u2248 108 yr, and tev \u2248 1010 yr. Thus, the LPs\nof young massive clusters should yield valuable information about equipartition\nand relaxation processes in the inner parts of these clusters.\nHow far can we hope to study LPs of clusters in sufficient detail to learn\nabout the structural details that interest us? Figure 2 shows the apparent sizes\nof the core, half-light, and tidal radius of a typical Milky-Way globular cluster\nas a function of its hypothetical distance in Mpc. This typical globular, with\nradii taken as the median values of 143 globulars listed by Djorgovski (1993),\nhas rc = 1.0 pc, reff = 2.8 pc, and rt = 33 pc, and a concentration index of\nc = 1.53. As the three sloping lines of Fig. 2 indicate, this cluster-if placed at\nthe distance of the LMC-would show a fully resolved core even from the ground\n(assumed seeing of 0.\u2032\u2032 5 FWHM). At the distance of M31 the same cluster would\nstill appear well resolved with HST, while at the 3.5 Mpc distance of M82 its\ncore would be only marginally resolved. Beyond the latter distance this typical\ncluster becomes unresolved at its center even when observed with HST. At the\n20 Mpc distance of The Antennae galaxies, even the half-light radius of such a\ncluster can no longer be resolved with HST and has to be estimated by placing\nan upper limit on it. Because of these resolution limits, we first review the fully\nresolved LPs of young massive clusters within the Local Group and then the\nonly partially resolved LPs of clusters beyond.\n3.\n3.1.\n\nYoung Massive Clusters in the Local Group\nMagellanic Cloud Clusters\n\nMuch new information on LPs of YMCs in the Local Group has been published\nduring the past five years, most of it for clusters in the Magellanic Clouds.\nTogether the LMC and SMC host an estimated \u223c6,000 clusters, most of which\n6\n9\nare <3\n\u223c Gyr old, offering us a rich sample of YMCs in the 10 \u2013 10 yr age range.\nMackey & Gilmore (2003a,b; hereafter MG03a,b) have just published the first\nsystematic HST/WFPC2 study of LPs of 53 rich clusters in the LMC and 10\n\n\f4\n\nSchweizer\n\nFigure 3.\nThe 32 Myr-old LMC cluster NGC 1850 (5\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032 field, NED/DSS)\nand its V -luminosity profile showing dips and bumps indicative of clumpy\nstructure (from Mackey & Gilmore 2003a).\n\nin the SMC, yielding profiles of sub-arcsecond resolution well into the cores\n(1\u2032\u2032 = 0.24 pc at LMC distance). Some of their main results are as follows.\nIn general, virtually all observed profiles of clusters younger than 1 Gyr are\nwell fit by EFF profiles, thus confirming the findings by EFF87. The slopes of\nthe power-law envelopes lie in the range \u03b3 = 2.0 \u2013 3.8, with a median \u03b3 \u2248 2.6.\nMany profiles show bumps, steps, and/or wiggles, indicating the presence of\nsignificant substructure. As an example, Fig. 3 shows the 32 Myr old cluster\nNGC 1850 and its profile. Notice the inner dip at r \u2248 8\u2032\u2032 and the outer bump\nnear r = 60\u2032\u2032 (log r = 1.78), which is created mainly by the distinct subclump of\nstars to the West, sometimes called NGC 1850 B. (The slope of the best-fit EFF\nprofile shown in the figure is likely too shallow because of the limited extent\nof the WFPC2 data, and the fitted profile should probably go through the last\ngroup of data points.) Subclumps are seen in the envelopes of most very young\nclusters and can still be traced in some clusters several 100 Myr old, suggesting\nthat cluster formation itself may be hierarchical (Kroupa 1998). Presumably,\nthis clumpiness accelerates the initial relaxation of newborn clusters.\nInterestingly, none of the observed 41 LMC clusters younger than 3 Gyr\nshows evidence of having undergone core collapse, as would be indicated by\na profile with power-law shape at the very center (MG03a). However, such\npost-core-collapse (PCC) structure is found in 3 \u00b1 1 of the 12 observed old\n(>10\n\u223c Gyr) LMC globulars. These and a few other known PCC clusters have\ncentral power-law profiles of slope \u2248 \u22120.7 and represent about 20% \u00b1 7% of the\nold cluster population in the LMC, a similar PCC fraction as is observed among\nthe globulars of the Milky Way. These observations support the theoretical result\nthat-at least for single-stellar-mass systems-core collapse takes 12 \u2013 19 trh to\noccur, or about 300 central relaxation times (e.g., Binney & Tremaine 1987).\nCorrelations between the core radius and various other cluster parameters\nhave been searched for, yet few have been found. Specifically, the core radius\ndoes not seem to correlate with cluster mass. The one significant correlation\n\n\fLuminosity Profiles of Resolved YMCs\n\nFigure 4.\n\n5\n\nCore radii plotted vs. age for LMC and SMC clusters (MG03a,b).\n\nfound is between the core radius and cluster age, as first shown by Elson, Freeman, & Lauer (1989).\nTrends of Core Radius with Age. Figure 4 shows the core radii of the 53 LMC\nand 10 SMC clusters observed by Mackey and Gilmore (MG03a,b) plotted versus\ncluster age \u03c4 . The new HST data confirm Elson et al's (1989) finding that the\ncore radii of the youngest clusters are <1\n\u223c pc and show little scatter, while those\nof clusters older than 20 Myr tend to increase with age at least until \u03c4 \u2248 1 Gyr\nand show large scatter at \u03c4 >\n\u223c 10 Gyr (0.8 <\n\u223c rc <\n\u223c 8 pc). However, the relation\nnow appears to have two branches: a lower branch containing about 3/4 of the\ntotal cluster population and reaching a maximum mean core radius of \u223c2.5 pc\nat \u03c4 \u2248 1 \u2013 2 Gyr before trending toward smaller rc again, and an upper branch\ncontaining about 1/4 of the clusters and showing core radii that increase in\nproportion to the logarithmic age. As MG03a,b demonstrate, for clusters older\nthan 10 Gyr as well as for all those older than 1 Gyr the bimodality in the coreradius distribution is highly significant (>99%, >99.5%), whence the bifurcation\nof the rc \u2013 log \u03c4 relation into two branches appears real.\nThe time evolution of core radii traced by the lower branch is about as\nexpected: The initial rapid core expansion is likely due to mass loss from massive\nstars (\u03c4 < 1 Gyr), and is followed by slow core contraction due to continued\nenergy equipartition and evaporation of stars, eventually leading to gravothermal\ninstability and core collapse (Elson et al. 1989; see also Binney & Tremaine 1987).\nThe time evolution of core radii traced by the upper branch, however, remains unexplained. Clusters of similar age and metallicity on the upper and\nlower branches appear to have had very similar Initial Mass Functions (IMF)\ndown to \u223c0.8 M\u2299 , whence IMF variations can be ruled out as an explanation for\nthe existence of two branches (de Grijs et al. 2002b). N -body simulations seem\nto also rule out as viable explanations any possible tidal-field variations due to\ndifferent cluster orbits and hypothetical large variations in the primordial binary\nfraction (Wilkinson et al. 2003). Perhaps most promising is the very recent suggestion that core formation and expansion may be driven dynamically by the\ncentral accumulation of massive stars and their black-hole remnants (Merritt et\n\n\f6\n\nSchweizer\n\nFigure 5.\nNewborn cluster R136/NGC 2070 (115\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 115\u2032\u2032 field, NASA)\nand V -luminosity profile with two-component fits superposed (from MG03a).\n\nal. 2004). The observed strong segregation of massive stars toward the cluster\ncenters (e.g., de Grijs et al. 2002a) and simple model simulations that reproduce\nthe approximately linear increase of rc with logarithmic age both seem to support this hypothesis. Yet, the hypothesis does not explain why the scatter in\ncore radii increases dramatically with age and why there should be two branches.\nNewborn Cluster R136/NGC 2070. R136 is the high-surface-brightness core\nof the 3 \u2013 4 Myr old cluster NGC 2070 located at the center of the 30 Doradus\nnebula, the most luminous H II region in the Local Group. Figure 5 shows\nthe cluster and its luminosity profile. This profile is the only one among the\n63 cluster profiles measured by MG03a,b that clearly shows a two-component\nstructure. It is well fitted by a central EFF model profile with rc <\n\u223c 0.32 pc\n\u2032\u2032 ), and by a second EFF (or King) profile with\n(1.\u2032\u2032 3) within the core (r <\n10\n\u223c\nrc \u2248 3.7 \u2013 8 pc (15\u2032\u2032 \u2013 33\u2032\u2032 ) beyond the core (Meylan 1993; MG03a).\nBecause R136/NGC 2070 is by far the youngest massive Magellanic Cloud\ncluster and possibly a globular cluster in formation (e.g., Kennicutt & Chu 1988),\nits study is of great interest and promises insights into the earliest dynamical\nevolution of YMCs. The evidence for mass segregation in it is strong: While\nthe core radius is rc = 0.32 pc for light from all stars, it drops to rc = 0.09 pc\nfor massive stars of >20 M\u2299 and \u223c0.03 pc for those of >40 M\u2299 (Brandl et al.\n1996). It is this strong central concentration of the most massive and luminous\nstars that led, during the 1980s, to the mistaken belief that a supermassive star\n(\"R136a\") of \u223c2500 M\u2299 might sit at the center of the cluster.\nAs we now know, there is a strong concentration of O3, O4, and WN stars\nat and near the center, some with masses thought to be as high as 130 \u2013 150\nM\u2299 (Massey & Hunter 1998). Spectroscopy and IR observations of these and\nother, pre-main-sequence stars suggest that lower-mass stars began forming in\nNGC 2070 about 4 \u2013 5 Myr ago, while the most massive stars formed a mere\n1 \u2013 2 Myr ago and quenched further star formation via their strong winds. Yet,\ndespite this sequential formation the overall IMF of NGC 2070 appears to be\nessentially normal and Salpeter-like. Specifically, searches for low-mass stars\n\n\fLuminosity Profiles of Resolved YMCs\n\n7\n\nshow evidence of rising numbers right into the core down to \u223c2.8 M\u2299 (Hunter\net al. 1995) and even 0.6 M\u2299 (Sirianni et al. 2000). Although because of the\nmass segregation the IMF does seem to flatten below \u223c2 M\u2299 within R136 itself,\noverall it appears very similar to the Kroupa (2001) or Chabrier (2003) IMFs\nnow generally thought to be characteristic of star formation in the Milky-Way\ndisk and in loose young clusters. Hence, the observations of this newborn cluster\nclearly contradict some theoretical predictions that the IMF of stars formed in\nhigh-density regions should be very top heavy. They also raise doubts about the\nimportance of occasionally-claimed primordial mass segregation.\nAn interesting question is whether the unusual core-within-a-core structure of R136/NGC 2070 may have led to early core collapse. Spitzer (1969)\nshowed that under certain circumstances clusters with a wide range of stellar\nmasses may experience an equipartition instability, in which the most massive\nstars form a dense subsystem at the core of the lighter stars. While exchanging\nenergy with the lighter stars, this subsystem can evolve away, rather than toward, equipartition, contracting rapidly and leading to accelerated core collapse.\nWhether this did or did not happen in R136 depends critically on the core radius\nmeasured as a function of mass and on the estimated central relaxation time.\nMG03a find marginal evidence for a central power-law cusp of slope \u22121.17, but\nconclude-like Brandl et al. (1996) before-that the evidence favors strong and\nrapid dynamical mass segregation over any post-core-collapse state.\nIn short, the two-component profile of this \u223c3 \u2013 4 Myr old cluster suggests\nthat (i) strong dynamical evolution and mass segregation occur very early on\nand (ii) core growth during the first \u223c10 Myr may be complex.\n3.2.\n\nClusters in Other Local Group Galaxies\n\nSurprisingly little information exists on the luminosity profiles of YMCs in Local\nGroup galaxies other than the Magellanic Clouds. For the Milky Way, M31, and\nM33 the situation is as follows.\nMilky-Way Clusters. The Milky Way seems to harbor few YMCs comparable\nto those in the LMC and SMC. Attempts to measure their LPs suffer from\nsevere disk-star contamination and extinction. Perhaps the best studied is the\n1 \u2013 2 Myr old cluster NGC 3603, whose AV = 4.5 mag is relatively benign. It is\none of the most massive young clusters known in the Milky Way, yet it has only\nabout 1/40th the mass of R136/NGC 2070. Like the latter, it features low-mass\nstars of 0.1 \u2013 1 M\u2299 right into its center and has a normal IMF (e.g., Brandl et\nal. 1999). Infrared observations yield a LP with a core radius of rc = 0.78 pc\n(23\u2032\u2032 ) and extending out to at least 5 pc, where it becomes lost in the light of\nforeground stars (N\u00fcrnberger & Petr-Gotzens 2002). The situation is even more\nchallenging for the Milky Way's central YMCs, with the Arches cluster showing\nextinction variations of \u2206AV \u2248 10 mag over 15\u2032\u2032 (Stolte et al. 2002) and, thus,\noffering little hope for any luminosity profiles in the near future.\nM31 Clusters. Although some YMCs resembling young globulars have long\nbeen known to exist in M31 (e.g., van den Bergh 1969), none have had their\nLPs measured. Yet, at least for the four 60 \u2013 160 Myr old YMCs observed by\nWilliams & Hodge (2001) with HST/WFPC2, LPs would be easy to derive from\nthe archival images. Luminosity profiles have, however, been measured for old\n\n\f8\n\nSchweizer\n\nFigure 6.\nThe Antennae galaxies (NGC 4038/39), and luminosity profiles\nof three young massive clusters in them (from Whitmore et al. 1999).\n\nmassive clusters and show evidence for PCC structure and extended envelopes\n(Grillmair et al. 1996) and, in the still controversial case of Cluster G1, for a\n4\ncentral black hole of mass 2.0+1.4\n\u22120.8 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 (Gebhardt, Rich, & Ho 2002).\nM33 Clusters. M33 hosts a rich system of 106 \u2013 1010 yr old clusters similar to\nthose in the Magellanic Clouds. For \u223c60 of these clusters, LPs have been derived\nfrom HST/WFPC2 images and fitted with King profiles (Chandar, Bianchi, &\nFord 1999). The measured core radii are rc \u2248 0.2 \u2013 2 pc, and there is evidence\nfor extended envelopes. At least for clusters younger than \u223c3 Gyr, the analysis\nneeds to be repeated with the more appropriate EFF profiles.\n4.\n\nYoung Massive Clusters Beyond the Local Group\n\nEven with HST, the cores of YMCs become marginally resolved around 2 \u2013 4 Mpc\nand unresolved beyond (Fig. 2). Special software has been developed to analyze\nobservations of partially resolved clusters by fitting King or EFF model light\ndistributions (Larsen 1999; Carlson & Holtzman 2001). Therefore, we can still\nextract some size and shape parameters from YMCs out to at least 20 Mpc.\nAmong relatively nearby (2 \u2013 6 Mpc) galaxies, luminosity profiles have been\nmeasured for YMCs in NGC 1569 (Hunter et al. 2000), M82 (de Grijs et al.\n2001), and NGC 6946 (Larsen et al. 2001). In general, the core radii of these\nYMCs are similar to those measured in LMC clusters. Also, all YMCs younger\nthan \u223c108 yr show power-law envelopes, and many show clumpy substructure.\nAn especially interesting case are the 43 globular clusters profiled in NGC\n5128 (4 Mpc, Harris et al. 2002), where six of the most luminous clusters\n(\u221210 <\n\u223c \u221211.3) show envelopes extending beyond the best-fit King mod\u223c MV <\nels. Although Harris et al. interpret these envelopes as being either due to\nevaporative mass loss or the remains of stripped former dwarf galaxies, a third\npossibility needs to be considered: The presence of intermediate-age globular\nclusters in NGC 5128 (Peng, Ford, & Freeman 2004) and the high luminosity\n\n\fLuminosity Profiles of Resolved YMCs\n\n9\n\nof the six globulars may indicate that these are relatively young clusters with\nincompletely stripped remains of their initial power-law envelopes.\nEven for galaxies more distant than 10 Mpc, there is still much to learn from\nluminosity profiles of YMCs. Especially intriguing are the hints of dynamical\nevolution seen among clusters of different ages in The Antennae (Whitmore et\nal. 1999). Figure 6 shows the LPs of three massive clusters there: Knot S and\n#430 are both very young (7 and 11 Myr), have unresolved cores, and display\npure power-law envelopes like young LMC clusters. In contrast, the 500 Myr-old\nCluster #225 shows both a larger, partially resolved core (rc = 5.6 pc) and an\nenvelope with a distinct tidal cutoff. This suggests that, like elsewhere, young\nclusters in The Antennae form with power-law envelopes, but then get truncated\nover the next several 100 Myr by external tidal forces.\nFinally, even at the 66 Mpc distance of the merger remnant NGC 7252\nevidence for extended envelopes of YMCs can be found. Among the \u223c300 young\nhalo globulars of solar metallicity and ages 300 \u2013 600 Myr (Miller et al. 1997;\nSchweizer & Seitzer 1998), the five most luminous clusters feature extended\nenvelopes reaching well past 100 pc radius. The most luminous, NGC 7252: W3\n(MV = \u221216.2), is a true supercluster with reff = 17 \u00b1 2 pc and a record-beating\nmass of M = (8 \u00b1 2) \u00d7 107 M\u2299 , corresponding to 15 \u2013 20\u00d7 the mass of \u03c9 Cen\n(Maraston et al. 2004). Apparently, while orbiting in the halo of NGC 7252 this\nheavy-weight young globular of age 300 \u2013 500 Myr may have managed to hang\non-so far-to most of its original power-law envelope.\nAcknowledgments.
