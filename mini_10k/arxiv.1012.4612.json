Formally, it is the\ndispersion relation of a massless relativistic fermion. Furthermore, the description of the low energy electronic\nexcitations can be accommodated in a Dirac-type equation. Indeed, starting from a tight-binding Hamiltonian,\nwith a hopping parameter independent of the lattice site,\none can compute exactly the dispersion relation, expand\naround the two inequivalent Dirac points to rewrite the\ndynamical equations of motion for electrons and holes as\na Dirac equation in two dimensions with the four component spinor given by\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\nb\n\u03c8+\n\uf8ec \u03c8a \uf8f7\n+ \uf8f7.\n\u03a8 = \uf8ec\na \uf8f8\n\uf8ed \u03c8\u2212\nb\n\u03c8\u2212\n\n(1)\n\nThe indices a and b refer to the two triangular sublattices, while the + and \u2212 indices to the two Dirac K\nand K \u2032 points. For a perfect graphene crystal structure\nthe fermions behave as massless relativistic particles8 ,\nwhich translates into the well known ballistic behavior\nof the electrons9\u201311 , and there is no gap between valence and conduction bands. However, if the two dimensional honeycomb array of carbon atoms is distorted due\nto the presence of impurities or to the distortion of the\ncrystal structure, for example, the fermions acquire an\neffective gap given by half of the mass gap. Besides\nfermion mass generation, quantum Hall effect8,12\u201317 ,\nfractionalization18\u201320 and Berry phases12 have been observed in two dimensional graphenelike structures.\nFractionalization in one dimensional models was investigated more than three decades ago21\u201323 within polyacetylene. A similar phenomena like fractional quantum\nhall effect due to quasiparticle fractional charge and/or\n\nfractional statistics can take place in two dimensional\nsystems12,16,17 .\nA dynamical theory for two dimensional graphene\nshould describe, of course, its phenomenology and should\nbe able to accommodate for the possibility of gap generation and fractionalization. In18 the authors presented\na mechanism for electron fractionalization in graphenelike systems keeping time reversal symmetry. Invoking a\nKekul\u00e9 texture, a complex order parameter \u22060 was introduced. \u22060 couples the two Dirac pointsq\nand changes\nthe electron dispersion relation to \u01eb(~k) = ~k 2 + |\u22060 |2 .\n\nAssuming a vortex-like profile \u2206(~r) = \u2206(r) ein\u03b8 , where\nn is an integer, with \u2206(r) vanishing as r|n| for small r\nand approaching \u22060 at large r, fractionalization was associated with the presence of a zero mode of the Dirac\nkernel. Although fractionalization was connected with\nthe vortex shape of \u2206(~r), in18 the authors do not specify\nthe dynamics for the complex vortex profile.\nIn19 a dynamical content to the vortices was introduced through a chiral gauge theory which is compatible with electron fractionalization, extending the work of\nHou et al 18 . In the language of19 , vortices are associated\nwith a complex scalar field \u03c6 which couples linearly to the\nfermions. Although, a dynamical equation was written,\nsee equations (13) and (14) in19 , the potential V (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6)\nwas left unspecified. From the point of view of Quantum\nField Theory (QFT), there is no reason to exclude other\ntypes of symmetries and couplings, not present in the\nmodel discussed by Jackiw and Pi, without destroying\nfractionalization.\nIndeed, field theoretical models have been applied\nto describe nanotubes and graphene physics with some\nsuccess in reproducing their quantum properties (see\ne.g.24,25 ). In this work, we elaborate on derivative free\nfermion-boson and boson self interactions allowed by\nQFT principles and discuss possible gauge interactions.\nThe models considered here are a generalization of the\nresults of19 and, besides the fermionic field, they consider a complex scalar field \u03c6 and a single gauge vector\n\n\f2\nA\u03bc field. Moreover, possible ways to distinguish between\nthe different gauge symmetries are discussed.\nOur interpretation for the complex scalar field and\ngauge field being that \u03c6 and A\u03bc resume all the dynamics\nof the self-interaction of the carbon background and the\nmean fermionic self interaction.\nThe usage of scalar and vector potentials to describe\nsome of the graphene properties is not new. Indeed,\nscalar and vector potentials, including gauge fields, have\nbeen used in the literature to describe disorder phenomena, including distortions of the lattice honeycomb, structural defects, point defects and self-doping effects associated with the breaking of electron-hole symmetry near\nthe Dirac points among other properties. A detailed discussion can be found in6,26 and references there in.\nGraphene is an electrical neutral system. On the other\nhand graphene has charge carriers. Therefore, it seems\nnatural to associate a charged field with the carbon background. Furthermore, if \u03c6 resumes the carbon background self-interactions it should be able to accommodate for the propagation of phonons in the carbon lattice. Phonons feel the density of states of the fermionic\ndegrees of freedom and one expects \u03c6 to couple to the\n\u0001\nb \u2020 a\n\u03c8\u2212 \u2212\ndensity of electron/holes, i.e. to \u03c8 \u03c8 = \u2212 \u03c8+\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nb \u2020 a\na \u2020 b\na \u2020 b\n\u03c8+ \u03c8\u2212 \u2212 \u03c8\u2212 \u03c8+ \u2212 \u03c8\u2212 \u03c8+ . Throughout this paper, we will use the chiral representation for the Dirac\nmatrices, where\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n0 ~\u03c3\n0 \u22121\n,\n(2)\n,\n~\u03b3 =\n\u03b30 =\n\u2212~\u03c3 0\n\u22121 0\nand\n\u03b35 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n;\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c3 j stand for the Pauli matrices. Besides the coupling to\nthe density of electron/holes, QFT allows also for a pseudoscalar like interaction, described by a coupling of \u03c6 to\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nb \u2020 a\na \u2020 b\na \u2020 b\nb \u2020 a\n\u03c8+ .\n\u03c8+ \u2212 \u03c8\u2212\n\u03c8\u2212 \u2212 \u03c8\u2212\n\u03c8\u2212 + \u03c8+\n\u03c8 \u03b35 \u03c8 = \u03c8+\nThe scalar and pseudoscalar interactions couple the two\ntriangular sublattices and the two Dirac points K and K \u2032\nin different ways. The models discussed in the present\nwork explore contributions coming from both type of interactions (i.e., \u03c8 \u03c8 and \u03c8\u03b35 \u03c8).\nThe potential energy for the complex scalar field \u03c6 can\naccommodate a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value\nh\u03c6i. If h\u03c6i =\n6 0, then the model generates a fermion mass\nvia spontaneous symmetry breaking. On the other hand,\nif h\u03c6i = 0, the electrons in graphene remain gapless.\nTherefore, we identify pure graphene with the vacuum\nstate where h\u03c6i = 0, with all other graphene distorted\nand/or doped states begin described by different vacuum\nand for these h\u03c6i =\n6 0.\nIn what concerns the bosonic fields, the model can accommodate mass gaps both for the scalar and vector excitations. In general, for the gauge theories considered\nhere, a fermion mass gap implies also a vector mass gap.\n\nThis comes directly from the Higgs mechanism for mass\ngeneration. The gap for the scalar excitations is linked\nwith the details of the potential V (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) and is not directly coupled with the fermion and vector gaps. Indeed,\nwe found that the scalar gap can vanish independently\nof the fermion and vector gaps.\nIn this paper we also discuss a number of different gauge models which, in principle could be suitable to describe graphene properties. The relation between the spectrum of the scalar and vector excitations\nwith the fermionic spectra depends on which symmetry\nis gauged. Further, the different connections between\nfermion, scalar and vector gaps opens for the possibility\nto check experimentally which of the gauge symmetries, if\nany, is realized in graphene. Changing the fermion mass\ngap, for example modifying the concentration of impurities and or the distortion of the lattice, and looking\non how the scalar/vector mass excitations adjust themselves, one can distinguish between the different gauge\nmodels. Besides the pattern of the mass gaps, in general,\nthe models allow also for vortex like solutions and are\ncompatible with fractional statistics.\nThese gauge models have finite energy vortex solutions. For one example, we show that the vortex solution implies in the quantization of the \"magnetic field\"\nflux. In this case, the abelian gauge field is connected\nwith the angular momenta of \u03c6 along an axis perpendicular to the graphene sheet and, in this sense, the flux\nof the \"magnetic field\" is a measure of the angular momenta of \u03c6. This particular solution can be interpreted\nas consequence of topological defects in the graphene\nstructure and, in principle, phenomena like the BohmAharonov27\u201329 effect can occur even when external electric and magnetic fields are absent.\nWe show that the vortex solutions of non-chiral gauge\nmodels presented here, have normalizable zero modes of\nthe Dirac equation. The presence of the normalizable\nzero modes implies fractionalization for graphene and\nthe quantum Hall effect in graphene sheets could become\npossible even without chiral gauge symmetry and without external electric and magnetic fields. The observation of the quantum Hall effect in two dimensional materials without external electromagnetic fields was also\ndiscussed, within the framework of tight binding models, in the work of Haldane30 and Hill et al 31 . According to the later work, the observation of the quantum\nHall effect without an electromagnetic field requires the\nbreaking of the sublattice symmetry, where the two sublattices a and b are interchanged, and the opening of a\nmass gap at one of the Dirac points, let us say K, while\nthe other Dirac point K \u2032 remains gapless. In the class\nof models discussed here, the mass gap is open, or not,\nsimultaneously at K and K \u2032 . Then, according to31 quantum Hall effect without an external magnetic field is not\nmeasurable as the contributions from K and K \u2032 to the\nHall conductivity cancel exactly. The models considered\nin the present work, although reproduce the tight binding model in the appropriate limit (see, for example, the\n\n\f3\npaper6 ) they give dynamics to all the fields that represent the carbon graphene background and the excitations\n\u03c6 and the gauge field. Recall that \u03c6 is charged and can\ngive rise to an electric current. In this sense, the models\ngo beyond the tight binding model, opening the possibility of having a dynamical situation where the conditions\nexplored in31 do no apply, and, perhaps, may allow the\nmeasurement of the quantum Hall effect in graphene. We\nplan to address this question in a future publication.\nWe would like to call the reader attention that, within\nthe class of gauge models discussed in the present work,\nfractionalization is allowed without breaking any of the\nusual discrete symmetries like, for example, time reversal.\nWe do not compute the rich set of zero modes of the\nDirac equation but those ones obtained here are, again,\nconnected with the angular momentum of the complex\nscalar field \u03c6.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section II the\neffective QFT for graphene are discussed, including its\nglobal symmetries. In section III, the different global\nsymmetries are gauged and we discuss how this change\nthe spectra of the scalar, vector and fermion excitations.\nFurthermore, combining the information on the different\ntypes of gaps, we are able to suggest an experimental\ntest to disentangle which of the gauge symmetries apply to graphene. In section IV the equations of motion\nare derived and the vortex solutions for the gauge models are discussed. The short distance and long distance\nproperties of the vortex are computed explicitly. The\ngauge models predict the flux quantization of the \"magnetic field\" associated with the gauge field. Further, the\nflux quantization is connected with the angular momenta\nof \u03c6. In section V the zero mode solutions of the Dirac\nequation for a vortex configuration are investigated. Finally, in section VI we resume and conclude.\nII.\n\nTHE EFFECTIVE MODEL\n\nLet us assume that the charge carries, i.e. electrons\nand holes, are relativistic fermions described by a four\ncomponent spinor \u03c8. The Lagrangian density describing\nthe interaction between fermions \u03c8 and \u03c6 can be written\nas\nL = \u03c8i \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 + \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u2020 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\n\n\u2212 P (\u03c6) \u03c8\u03c8 \u2212 P5 (\u03c6) \u03c8\u03b35 \u03c8 \u2212 V (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) , (4)\n\nwhere the polynomial P (\u03c6) and P5 (\u03c6) define the type\nof interaction between fermions and the carbon crystal\n\nstructure and V (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) the self interactions of the background structure.\nThe reader should note the linear combination of P \u03c8\u03c8\nand P5 \u03c8\u03b35 \u03c8 couplings. Such a freedom would allows to\nset different couplings to each of the possible fermion chiralities and, in this way, build a chiral theory. Moreover,\nother Dirac \u03b3-matrices are allowed. However, to keep it\nas simple as possible and to avoid derivative couplings,\nin the following we will consider only scalar and pseudoscalar types of interactions.\nIn a system of units where the action is dimensionless,\nspace and time have dimensions of an inverse mass, and\nfor two spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension,\n\u03c8 has dimension of mass, [\u03c8] \u223c M , and \u03c6 of square root\nof mass, [\u03c6] \u223c M 1/2 . Requiring that the theory described\nby L is perturbatively renormalizable, then for polynomial interactions, naive power counting forbids coupling\nconstants [g] \u223c M \u03b1 with \u03b1 < 0. This fixes unambiguously the interaction terms to\nP (\u03c6) = g1 \u03c6 + \u03c6\u2020\n\nP5 (\u03c6) = h1 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2020\nand\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n+ g2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 ,\n\n(5)\n\n+ i h2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u0001\n\u03bb6 \u2020 \u00013\n\u03bb4 \u2020 \u00012\n\u03c6 \u03c6 +\n\u03c6 \u03c6\n(7)\nV (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) = \u03bc2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 +\n2\n3\n\nup to a constant V0 .\nIf in P (\u03c6) and P5 (\u03c6) one takes h1 = \u2212g1 and g2 =\nh2 = 0 one recovers the Jackiw-Pi theory with their \u03c6r =\n2 Re(\u03c6) and \u03c6i = 2 Im(\u03c6) \u2013 see equation (8) in19 . In this\nsense L generalizes the results of19 .\nLet us discuss now the global symmetries of the model\ndescribed by the Lagrangian density (4).\n\nA.\n\nGlobal UA (1) Symmetry\n\nOne of the motivations of19 was to build a chiral gauge\ntheory. So let us consider the same type of chiral transformation, i.e.\n\u03c8 \u2212\u2192 ei\u03c9\u03b35 \u03c8 ,\n\n\u03c6 \u2212\u2192 ei\u03b7 \u03c6 .\n\n(8)\n\nTo first order in \u03c9 and \u03b7, the corresponding variation of\nthe Lagrangian density reads\n\nn\nn\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0001o\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0001o\n2i\u03c9 h1 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2020 + ih2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 + i\u03b7g1 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2020\n\u03c8\u03c8 + 2i\u03c9 g1 \u03c6 + \u03c6\u2020 + g2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 + i\u03b7h1 \u03c6 + \u03c6\u2020\n\u03c8\u03b35 \u03c8 . (9)\nRequiring invariance of L under the transformation (8), it\nfollows that g2 = h2 = 0, as in the Jackiw-Pi theory, and\n\ng1 = \u00b1h1 and \u03b7 = \u00b12\u03c9, with the minus sign recovering\n\n\f4\nthe original Jackiw-Pi theory. Note that, from the point\nof view of the (8), invariance of the theory means that\nthe chiral charge associated with \u03c6 is, up to a sign, twice\nthe fermionic charge.\nThe set of transformations (8) with \u03b7 = \u00b12\u03c9 form a\ngroup which will be called from now on UA (1). Recall\nthat the Lagrangian density is invariant under UA (1) if\nand only if g2 = h2 = 0 and g1 = \u00b1h1 .\nB.\n\nGlobal U (1) Symmetries\n\nBesides the chiral transformation just discussed, the\nLagrangian density (4) has further non-chiral U (1) global\nsymmetries. The set of transformations\n\u03c8 \u2212\u2192 ei\u03c9 \u03c8\n\n(10)\n\ndefines the Uf (1) global symmetry of L and the set\n\u03c6 \u2212\u2192 ei\u03c9 \u03c6 ,\n\n(11)\n\ndefines the Ub (1) global symmetry of L if g1 = h1 = 0.\nFurther, if g1 = h1 = 0 in (5) and (6), then the set of\ntransformations\n\u03c8 \u2212\u2192 ei\u03c9 \u03c8 ,\n\n\u03c6 \u2212\u2192 ei\u03b7 \u03c6 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c9 and \u03b7 are independent parameters defines another global symmetry of L, called below Uf (1) \u2297 Ub (1).\nGauging this symmetry requires the introduction of two\ngauge fields unless one imposes an additional discrete\nsymmetry with respect to the interchange of the gauge\nfields. Note that the discrete symmetry gives no constraint on the coupling constants for the fermionic, g,\nand bosonic, g\u03c6 , fields. Indeed, the fermionic covariant\nderivative reads D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + igA\u03bc , while the bosonic covariant derivative is D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + ig\u03c6 A\u03bc , where A\u03bc is the\ngauge field. For the sake of simplicity, i.e. to avoid considering more than one gauge field, we will analyze only\nthe Uf (1) \u2297 Ub (1) symmetry supplement with the discrete symmetry. Anyway, we will keep using the name\nUf (1) \u2297 Ub (1) for the symmetry.\nC.\n\nOn The Various Global Symmetries\n\nThe various global symmetries are distinguished by the\nnature of the \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c8 interaction and by the number of independent coupling constants associated with the gauge\nfield required to define the model.\nThe UA (1) symmetry\nis not \u0001compatible with the in\u0001\nteractions \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 \u03c8 \u03c8 and \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 \u03c8 \u03b35 \u03c8 and only linear\nin \u03c6 terms are allowed in the interaction with fermions.\nFurther, the model defines a unique coupling constant.\nThe Uf (1) allows linear and quadratic \u03c6 couplings to\nthe fermionic field and requires a unique gauge coupling\nconstant.\nThe local symmetries Ub (1) and Uf (1)\u2297Ub (1) are compatible only with a quadratic \u03c6 coupling to the fermion\n\nSymmetry\nUA (1)\nUf (1)\nUb (1)\nUf (1) \u2297 Ub (1)\n\nConstraints\ng2 = h2 = 0, g1 = \u00b1h1\nnone\ng1 = h1 = 0\ng1 = h1 = 0\n\nTABLE I: Global symmetries of the Lagrangian density (4).\nRecall that for Uf (1)\u2297Ub (1) we impose an additional discrete\nsymmetry \u2013 see text for discussions.\n\nfields. If Ub (1) requires a unique gauge coupling constant,\nthe gauge model with Uf (1)\u2297Ub (1) as a symmetry group\nincludes two independent gauge couplings.\nTable I resumes the global symmetries of Lagrangian\ndensity (4) and the corresponding constraints on the \u03c6\u2212\u03c8\ncoupling constants.\n\nIII.\n\nGAUGE MODELS AND MASS GAP\n\nThe various U (1) symmetries of L, see table I, can\nbe made local. Different symmetries will lead to different gauge theories for graphene, after replacing the\nderivatives by covariant derivatives and adding the corresponding kinetic term for the gauge field. Naturally,\nthe different symmetries will introduce different dynamics which can be seen, for example, at the level of the\ntheory spectra, i.e. at the various mass gaps.\nRecall that we are excluding derivative type couplings.\nIn what concerns the gauge field, not including derivative\ncouplings means that a priori we are excluding a ChernSimons term32\u201334\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 A\u03b1 (\u2202\u03b2 A\u03b3 )\n\n(13)\n\nin L. This type of interaction is allowed by gauge invariance and, in 2+1 dimensions, is not excluded by the\nrenormalizability requirement.\n\nA.\n\nScalar Mass Gap\n\nWe start our discussion looking at the scalar excitations in graphene, i.e. looking at the mass spectra for\nthe complex scalar field \u03c6.\nThe self interactions of \u03c6 are described by the potential\nenergy V (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) \u2013 see equation (7). Depending on the values for \u03bc2 , \u03bb3 and \u03bb6 , V can have either one, two or three\nminima. The discussion of the V (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) extrema is relatively straightforward and will not be reproduced here.\nThe relation between potential parameters and number\nof extrema is summarized in table II.\nThe mass gap for the scalar excitations, i.e. the mass\nassociated with the complex scalar field, can be computed\nfrom (7) writing \u03c6 = v + \u03a6, where v = h\u03c6i is the vacuum\nexpectation value of \u03c6 assumed to be real. If \u03c6 can be\nrotated in such a way that it becomes a real field, then\n\n\f5\n\n\u03bc2\n<0\n>0\n>0\n>0\n<0\n\nItem\n\u03bb4\n>0\n<0\n>0\n<0\nany\n\n\u03bb6\n<0\n>0\n>0\n>0\n>0\n\n\u03b4\n0\n0\n>0\n>0\n>0\n\n# extrema\n1 maximum\n1 minimum\n1 minimum\n5 extrema\n3 extrema\n\nTABLE II: The number of extrema of V (\u03a6) as a function of\nthe potential parameters. Our definition for \u03b4 is \u03b4 = \u03bb24 \u2212\n4 \u03bc2 \u03bb6 .\n\nit follows that the quadratic term in V (\u03a62 ) is given by\n\u0001\n1 2 2\nM\u03a6 \u03a6 = 2v 2 \u03bb4 + 2v 2 \u03bb6 \u03a62\n2\n\n(14)\n\nand one can define the mass gap for scalar excitations as\np\n(15)\n\u2206\u03a6 = M\u03a6 = 2 |v| \u03bb4 + 2v 2 \u03bb6 .\n\nThe scalar mass gap is, then, independent of the gauged\nsymmetry.\nA non-vanishing M\u03a6 requires either a non-vanishing\nexpectation value for h\u03c6i or a h\u03c6i = 0 and a \u03bc2 > 0. Furthermore, a non-vanishing scalar gap requires also that\n\u03bb4 + 2v 2 \u03bb6 > 0, if h\u03c6i =\n6 0.\nFrom equations (14) and (15) it follows that the model\nis compatible with a non-vanishing \u03c6 vacuum expectation\nvalue, i.e. a h\u03c6i 6= 0, in combination with a vanishing\nscalar gap if and only if \u03bb4 = \u22122v 2 \u03bb6 . In this case, the\ntheory predicts a fermionic mass gap proportional to h\u03c6i,\nwith no gap formation for the scalar excitations, i.e the\ndispersion relation for the scalar excitations is linear in\n|~k|.\nB.\n\nFermionic Mass Gap\n\nFor the fermions fields, if \u03c6 and/or \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 acquire a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value, then L acquires a\nmass term and a chiral mass term \u2013 see equations (4),\n(5) and (6).\nLet us assume that h\u03c6i = v 6= 0, with v being a real\nnumber. From the point of view of the fermions themselves, the interaction with the carbon structure shows\nup as\nm\ne \u03c8 \u03c8 + i h 2 v 2 \u03c8 \u03b35 \u03c8\n\n(16)\n\nwhere m\ne = 2 g1 v + g2 v 2 . There is no reason a priori to\nrequire the positivity of m\ne or h2 . Indeed, solving the free\nDirac equation, with a mass term given by (16), gives the\nfollowing dispersion relation\nq\n\u01eb(~\np 2 ) = p~ 2 + m\ne 2 + h22 v 4 ,\n(17)\np\ni.e. the effective fermion mass is given by m\ne 2 + h22 v 4\nand the corresponding mass gap between valence and\n\np\nconducting bands is 2 m\ne 2 + h22 v 4 . The above reasoning is valid even when h\u03c6i = 0 and h\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6i 6= 0. In this\ncase m\ne = g2 h\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6i and h2 h\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6i replaces h2 v 2 .\nThe coupling of the complex scalar field \u03c6 to the\nfermion degrees of freedom is given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\ng1 \u03c6 + \u03c6\u2020 + g2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 \u03c8 \u03c8\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\n+ h1 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2020 + i h2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 \u03c8 \u03b35 \u03c8 , (18)\n\nwhich has exactly the same structure as the mass term\ngiven by equation (16). Therefore, the status of the field\n\u03c6 can be translated into a dynamical fermion mass, i.e.\na dynamical mass gap, which is both time and spatial\ndependent. The model accommodates graphene states\nwhere for certain space-time regions the system is gapless, i.e \u03c6 6= 0, and for others where \u03c6 = 0 and there is no\ngap. We are currently exploring the implications of this\ndynamical gap to graphene properties and will report the\nresults elsewhere.\nIn graphene the fermionic mass gap \u2206 is a function of\ngauged symmetry. It follows that for\nUA (1)\nUf (1)\nUb (1), Uf (1) \u2297 Ub (1)\n\n\u2206 = 4 |g1 v| ,\n(19)\nq\ne 2 + h22 v 4 , (20)\n\u2206=2 m\nq\n\u2206 = 2 g22 + h22 v 2 (21)\n\nwhere \u2206 is twice the fermion mass.\nC.\n\nVector Mass Gap\n\nIt remains to discuss the mass gap for the vector excitations in graphene. The mass term for A\u03bc is generated by the scalar kinetic part of L, i.e. by (D\u03bc \u03c6)\u2020 D\u03bc \u03c6.\nTherefore, unless the gauge transformation changes \u03c6,\nthe gauge field remains massless. It follows that for\n\u221a\nUA (1)\n\u2206A = 2 |g1 v| , (22)\nUf (1)\n\u2206A = 0 ,\n(23)\n\u221a\nUb (1), Uf (1) \u2297 Ub (1)\n\u2206A = 2 |g\u03c6 v|\n(24)\nwhere \u2206A is the vector mass, i.e. the vector mass gap.\nD.\n\nGauge Symmetries and Gap Relations\n\nThe mass, i.e. the gaps, for each of the fields in the\nmodel are generated via Higgs mechanism. Besides the\nmass, the Higgs mechanism also provides a relation, dependent on the symmetry group, between the different\ngaps - see Table III for a summary of the results discussed in the previous sections.\nA UA (1) chiral gauge theory implies a linear relation\n\u221a\nbetween the vector and fermion mass gaps \u2206A = \u2206/ 8,\nwhile Ub (1) or Uf (1) \u2297 Ub (1) relate the two mass gaps\n\n\f6\nSymmetry\nUA (1)\nUf (1)\nUb (1)\nUf (1) \u2297 Ub (1)\n\n\u2206\n4p\n|g1 v|\n2pm\ne + h22 v 4\n2pg22 + h22 v 2\n2 g22 + h22 v 2\n\n\u2206A\n\u221a\n2 |g1 v|\n0\n\u221a\n2 |g\u03c6 v|\n\u221a\n2 |g\u03c6 v|\n\nTABLE III: Mass gaps as a function of the gauge symmetry \u2013\nsee text for discussions.

However, if Ub (1) does not couples directly the fermions to the vector excitations, the\nUf (1) \u2297 Ub (1) gauge symmetry has such a direct coupling between electrons and gauge field. Of course, if\nthe strength of this coupling is extremely small, then the\ntwo theories will give exactly the same predictions for\ngraphene. However, if the coupling \u03c8\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8 A\u03bc is sizable\nenough, then the fermionic interaction with the vector excitations will give relevant contributions to the dynamics\nof graphene and the two symmetries will provide different\nphysics for vector and fermion excitations.\nIn the models discussed above, the gap in graphene is\ngenerated via spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is\nnot the only way of having massive particles in a theory.\nFor example, as discussed in25 , a fermionic gap can also\nbe generated via dynamical symmetry breaking.\n\nIV.\n\n3\n\nFIG. 1: \u2206A and \u2206\u03a6 as function of the fermionic mass gap \u2206.\nThe curves where computed setting all the coupling constants\nand the potential parameters to one and using arbitrary units.\n\np\nby a quadratic equation \u22062A = \u2206 g\u03c62 / g22 + h22 . For\nthe gauge theory associated with the Uf (1) symmetry,\nthere is a mass gap for the fermionic and scalar degrees\nof freedom, but no gap for the vector excitations.\nA non-vanishing fermionic mass gap requires a h\u03c6i =\n6 0\nor h\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6i 6= 0, which by itself implies a scalar mass gap in\ngraphene. The connection between the scalar mass gap\n\u2206\u03c6 and the remaining gaps is slightly more complicated\nthan the relation between \u2206 and \u2206A .\nThe scalar, fermion and vector mass gaps are functions of the coupling constants and of the \u03c6 vacuum expectation value. The connection between the mass gaps\nand the fundamental parameters of the theory depend\non which global symmetry is gauged, as summarized in\ntable III. Moreover, all the mass gaps can be written in\nterms of the fermionic gap \u2206. Therefore, if one is able\nto build graphene with different mass gaps, for example\nchanging its doping and/or distortion, one can test which\nof the symmetries discussed before applies to graphene,\nif any, simply looking at how \u2206A and \u2206\u03a6 change with\n\u2206. As an illustration, in figure 1 we show \u2206A and \u2206\u03a6\nas a function of \u2206 when all the coupling constants are\nset to unit. The figure uses arbitrary units. Clearly, the\nfunctional behaviour distinguish between a chiral gauge\ntheory and a Ub (1) or a Uf (1) \u2297 Ub (1) gauge symmetry.\nA \u2206A = 0 for all values of \u2206 clearly points towards a\n\nEQUATIONS OF MOTION, VORTICES AND\nFLUX QUANTIZATION\n\nThe equations of motion associated with the various\nfields are derived from L in the usual way.

(27)\nEquations (25), (26) and (27) are the equations of motion derived from L taking into account all the possible\ncoupling constants. In order to study each of the gauge\ntheories considered previously, one has to take into account the corresponding constraints associated with the\ngauge group and summarized in table I.\n\nA.\n\nVortex Solutions\n\nLet us now discuss vortex like solutions for the bosonic\nsector of the theory, disregarding the coupling to the\nfermionic degrees of freedom.

In this section we will consider only the Ub (1)\nand Uf (1) \u2297 Ub (1) symmetries.\nLet us first discuss the solutions of equations (31) and\n(32) at small distances. For r \u226a 1, the gauge field equation becomes\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 d\ndb\nb\nr\n\u2212 2 = 0,\n(33)\nr dr\ndr\nr\n\nand b(r) is also a solution of equation (32). Note that this\nsolution can be extended to full range of r values, with\nthe exception of the origin, where a delta function sets\nin coming from the laplacian of b. On the other hand, if\n\u03c60 = 0, i.e. for pure graphene, one still has a solution for\nb as in (34). However, the requirement of finite energy\ndemands b1 = 0.\nThe vortex solutions include, as a particular case, the\ntype of configurations considered in19 , where b(r) is regular and \u03c60 (r) \u223c r|n| , for r \u226a 1, and, for large r, \u03c60\nbecomes constant and b(r) \u223c 1/r. A class of vortices\nwhose short distance behavior is given by (37) was found.\nFurthermore, the zero modes of the Dirac equation computed in the next section require a vortex solution with\n\u03c60 constant and non-vanishing and b(r) = a\u2032 (r) given\nby (38) over all space, with the exception of the origin as\ndiscussed previously. From the point of view of the gauge\nmodels, the singular behavior at r = 0 does not raise any\nconceptual problems. Indeed, we are using a continuous\nmodel to describe graphene and the dimensions of the\nunit cell provide a natural short-distance cut-off below\nwhich the model is no longer valid or, at best, should be\ncorrected to take into account the crystal structure of the\ncarbons and lattice defects.\nIf one takes the usual definition for the \"magnetic\n~ = \u2207 \u00d7 A,\n~ it follows that B\n~ vanishes at large\nfield\", B\n~\nr. Close to the origin, B approaches a constant for type\n(36) solution and vanishes for (37) configurations. For\nboth type of configurations, the vortex energy\nZ\n\nprovided that \u03c60 (r) is regular at the origin, whose solution is\nb(r) = b1 r +\n\nb\u22121\n,\nr\n\n(34)\n\nwhere b1 and b\u22121 are constant of integration.

Flux quantization opens the possibility of having Bohm-Aharonov\ntype effects in graphene without external electromagnetic fields, where electrons are scattered by a vector\npotential, which can be associated with a \"topological\ndefect\" on the carbon structure, and acquire an extra\nphase. We call the reader attention that Bohm-Aharonov\nphases have been observed in suspended graphene, in association with mesoscopic deformations, where the measured charge carriers mobility is substantial larger than\nin graphene on a substrate - see26 and references therein.\n\n\f8\nV.\n\nFRACTIONALIZATION, DIRAC EQUATION\nAND ZERO MODES\n\nAs discussed at the beginning of the present work, electron fractionalization is related to the normalizable zero\nmodes of the Dirac kernel. The presence of these zero\nmodes opens the possibility of observation of fractional\nquantum Hall effect in graphene. A nice discussion connecting the Dirac equation zero modes with electron fractionalization can be found, for example, in18 .\nFor the UA (1) gauge theory, the proof of the presence of normalizable zero modes can be found in19 . The\nUf (1) gauge theory includes, as a particular case, the\nDirac equation discussed by Hou, Chamon and Mudry\nin18 . Therefore, for Uf (1) gauge theory fractionalization is possible. It remains to discuss the Ub (1) and\nUf (1) \u2297 Ub (1) gauge theories.

This symmetry generalizes the\nsublattice symmetry of the Dirac equation already discussed in18 . We proceed assuming that \u03a8b\u00b1 = 0. Note\nthat, for zero modes, given a solution of the Dirac equation in sublattice a, the generalized sublattice symmetry\ngenerates another zero mode but leaving in sublattice b,\nor vice-versa.

Let us look for config-\n\n\f9\nurations where \u03c60 (r) is a non vanishing constant, i.e. a\nminimum of V (\u03c620 ). Then, \u2206\u20320 = 0 and \u22060 = z \u03c620 is also\na non vanishing constant. The equation of motion of the\nscalar field (31) gives\nb(r) = a\u2032 (r) = \u2212\n\nn\n.\ng\u03c6 r\n\n(53)\n\nThis particular gauge configuration solves the equation of\nmotion for the gauge field (32), except at the origin where\na Dirac delta function sets is due to the laplacian operator. Our vortex solution requires a short-distance cut-off,\nwhich is provided by the dimensions of the graphene unit\ncell or the length scale associated with a defect. Indeed,\nfor distances smaller than the unit cell dimensions, the\ncontinuum description of graphene should breakdown.\nFor this vortex solutions, the gauge field is linked with\nthe angular momenta, relative to an axis perpendicular to\nthe graphene sheet, of \u03c6. Further, recall that the \"magnetic field\" associated with this type of vortex solution\nvanishes and, therefore, the energy associated with the\nvortex also vanishes.\nFor a vortex with a constant \u03c60 , equation (52) simplifies to\n\"\n#\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1\ng\n1\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032+ + \u03c6\u2032+ + \u2212 2 m \u2212\nn \u2212 \u220620 \u03c6+ = 0. (54)\nr\nr\ng\u03c6\nThe solutions of this equation are the modified Bessel\nfunctions I and K of argument \u22060 r for particular combinations of the angular momenta associated with \u03c6, \u03c6+\nand \u03c6\u2212 \u2013 see appendix A for details.\nThe gauge model has, at least, one normalizable zero\nmode state of the Dirac equation. Therefore, the Ub (1)\nand Uf (1) \u2297 Ub (1) gauge models can accommodate electron fractionalization without the presence of external\nelectromagnetic fields. More, given the vortex solution\nand relation (53), besides fractionalization, the gauge\nmodels also incorporates flux quantization associated\nwith the \"magnetic field\". The phase-shifts coming from\nthe Bohm-Aharonov effect associated with the vortex are\nconnected with the component of the angular momenta\nof \u03c6 along an axis perpendicular to the graphene layer.\nA.\n\nZero modes and Conformal Invariance\nBreakdown\n\nThe Sturm-Liouville form\n\u221a of the zero mode equation is\nfound by setting \u03c6+ = F/ z, with z = \u22060 r, in equation\n(54), which becomes\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 1\n(55)\n\u2212 \u03bd2 F = F ,\nF \u2032\u2032 + 2\nz 4\n\u0010\n\u00112\nwhere \u03bd 2 = m \u2212 gg\u03c6 n . This equation is equivalent to a one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger eigenvalue problem with a potential 1/z 2 which expresses invariance under scale change. The conformal symmetry is broken\n\nby the ultraviolet physics associated with defects/unity\ncell scales. Given that \u03bd 2 \u2265 0, the potential strength\nfor the Schr\u00f6dinger problem is above the BreitenlohnerFreedman bound35 and the corresponding quantum mechanical model is free from instabilities, i.e. the zero\nmode state does not collapse. In other contexts, for example in ultracold atomic physics, the violation of this\nbound gives rise to the Efimov effect36 .\nWe observe the connection between the fermionic\nSturm-Liouville equation and the dynamics of fermion\nfields in a supergravity Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) background\n\u2013 see, for example,37 . In this description, the metric embodies conformal invariance leading to a 1/r2 potential\nassociated, in our case, with the vortex solutions. The\nmass term of the fermionic field in the corresponding\nsupergravity action contains the factor \u03bd 2 (see e.g.38 ).\nWithin this framework, the required short-range regularization (see the appendix) could be performed at the\nexpense of introducing a dilaton field coupled to gravity, deforming the AdS metric39,40 . This suggests that\nthe Maldacena conjecture of the AdS/CFT (conformal\nfield theory) duality41,42 , may well provide fresh insights\nto graphene physics. For example, the vector mass gap\ncould be a consequence of breaking exact symmetries in\nholographic 10-dimensional backgrounds, encoding mass\ngaps for the fermionic field and vector fluctuations43 .\n\nVI.\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we discuss gauge theories for graphene.\nThe building of the gauge models starts assuming that\ngraphene dynamics can be described by fermion fields\ntogether with a complex scalar field \u03c6. The field \u03c6 resumes the self-interaction of the carbon background and\nthe mean fermionic self interaction. After exploring the\nglobal symmetry of the most general lagrangian, excluding derivative-like couplings, the corresponding gauge\nmodels are investigated.\nThe gauge models are compatible with a gap for\nfermion, vector and scalar fields. The mass gaps are\ngenerated via an Higgs mechanism. Further, the mass\ngaps associated with each gauge model are connected\nin different ways, which opens for the possibility of experimentally distinguish between the models. Indeed, as\nclaimed in section III D, for example, changing the concentration of impurities in graphene, one can change the\nfermionic gap and check how the scalar and vector gaps\nadjust and, in this way, check which of the gauge models, if any, reproduce the graphene results. Furthermore,\nin what concerns the fermionic gap, within the models\nconsidered here, the mass gap is a dynamical quantity\nassociated with the field \u03c6.\nThe gauge models have finite energy vortex solutions.\nTherefore, phenomena like the flux quantization of the\n\"magnetic field\", in association with topological defects\nof the carbon structure, and/or Bohm\u2013Aharonov type effects become possible within the description of graphene\n\n\f10\nby gauge models. Several types of vortex solutions where\ndiscussed and, in general, the gauge field is linked with\ncomponent of the angular momenta, along an axis perpendicular to the graphene plan, of \u03c6. For this type\nof solution the phases associated with Bohm\u2013Aharonov\ntype effects are a measure of the \u03c6 angular momenta.\nFinally, we have investigated the two dimensional\nDirac equation for the vortex solutions. A generalization\nof the sublattice symmetry was discussed and we showed\nthat all gauge models have normalizable zero modes together with a non-vanishing fermionc gap. Fractionalization is then possible in all the gauge models considered here. Within this theoretical background one expects that fractional quantum Hall effect can take place\nin graphene in connection with the zero mode solutions,\neven when there are no external electromagnetic fields.\nSee also the discussion at the end of section I.\nThe models investigated are potentially useful to describe graphene. Indeed, they unify, under the same dynamical principle, several features of the graphene and\npredict others. The models have multiple parameters\nwhose values should be found by reproducing experimentally known graphene properties. We are currently engaged in performing such an investigation and will report\nthe results elsewhere.\nAppendix A: Zero Modes of the Dirac Equation\n\nLet us discuss the solutions of equation (54),\n\"\n#\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1 \u2032\ng\n1\n\u2032\u2032\n2\n\u03c6+ + \u03c6+ + \u2212 2 m \u2212\nn \u2212 \u22060 \u03c6+ = 0 .

A\nshort distance cut-off r0 is introduced and the \"potential\" is replaced by its value at r0 . However, if \u03c6+ can\nbe made regular at the origin, \u03c6\u2212 being given by (51)\nwill diverge near the origin. Due to this short distance\ndivergence, \u03c6\u2212 is not normalizable unless the model has\na minimal distance beyond which the continuum description of graphene no longer makes sense. The dimensions\nof the unit cell provide such an infrared cut-off. Remember that, in graphene, the carbon atoms are separated by\na \u2248 1.42 \u00c5 and for r < a one can set \u03c6\u00b1 (r) \u2248 \u03c6\u00b1 (a) and\nhave a continuous and normalizable spinor.\nWe call the reader attention that the introduction of\na short distance, i.e. ultraviolet, cut-off for the fermions\nfields does not change the results of section IV A. Indeed, the Dirac zero modes give no contribution to the\nequations of motion associated with the vortex solution\nof section IV A. In this sense, the flux quantization of\nthe gauge field and the Bohm-Aharonov effect discussed\nthere, i.e. the topological properties of the vortex solution, are independent of the Dirac spinors. On the other\nhand, the requirement that the Dirac spinors are normalizable is a necessary condition to have electron fractionalization; see, for example, the discussion in the work of\nHou et al 18 .\nThe singular behavior at r = 0 seem to be an indication of a \"hole\" at the center of the unit cell. This\n\"hole\" is a topological obstruction and is at the origin of\nthe topological properties of the model analyzed in the\npresent work.\n\n(A3)\n\nNote that \u03bd can be a real number. Of I\u00b1\u03bd (z) and K\u03bd (z)\nfunctions, only the last one tends to zero as r \u2192 +\u221e.\nIndeed, in this limit\nr\n\u03c0 \u2212z\nK\u03bd (z) =\ne ,\n(A4)\n2z\n\n1\n\nwith its first derivative having a similar functional behavior. Therefore, modulo the behavior for small r, in\nprinciple, setting \u03c6+ proportional to K\u03bd the differential\nequation (54) is solved and the spinor is normalizable.\nFor small r\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors acknowledge financial support from the\nBrazilian agencies FAPESP (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0\nPesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo) and CNPq (Conselho\nNacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u0301fico e Tecnol\u00f3gico).\n\n2\n\nK.
