INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently a great deal of theoretical progress has been made in the construction of lattice\nregularizations of fermions with good chiral properties [1\u20133]. For use in practical numerical\nsimulations, though, approximations to these formulations are necessary. In the formulation\nusing domain wall fermions (DWF) [1,4], the extent of an auxiliary fifth dimension has to\nbe kept finite in numerical simulations while chiral symmetry holds strictly only in the limit\nof infinite fifth dimension. The violations of chiral symmetry are expected to be suppressed\nexponentially in the extent of the fifth dimension [4,5], but in practice the coefficient in the\nexponent can be quite small [6,7] and the suppression correspondingly slow.\nIn the case of overlap fermions there is no such problem in principle.\nHowever, there is\n\u221a\n2\na problem of practicality: how to deal efficiently with \u01eb(H) = H/ H , where H is some\nauxiliary Hermitian lattice Dirac operator for large negative mass, but free of doublers. Most\ncommonly, the Hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator Hw is used. So far, the best methods use\nrational polynomial approximations of \u01eb(H) rewritten as a sum over poles\n!\nn\nX\nHP (H 2)\nck\n\u01eb(H) =\n.\n(1)\n= H c0 +\nQ(H 2 )\nH 2 + bk\nk=1\nVariants of this are Neuberger's polar decomposition [8] and the optimal rational polynomial\napproximation of Ref. [9,10]. In the application of \u01eb(H) on a vector \u03c8 the shifted inversions\n(H 2 + bk )\u22121 \u03c8 are done simultaneously with a multi-shift CG inverter [11]. This is referred\nto as the \"inner CG\", since typically another, \"outer\", CG method is used to compute\npropagators or eigenvalues of the overlap Dirac operator containing \u01eb(H).\nIn these methods, the main problem is the difficulty of getting an accurate approximation\nto \u01eb(x) for small x1 . As emphasized in Ref. [12,10] accuracy for the lower range of the\nspectrum of H can always be enforced by calculating a sufficient number of eigenvectors of\nH with small eigenvalues and computing \u01eb(H) in the space spanned by these eigenvectors\nexactly. The approximation is then only used after projecting out these eigenvectors. This\nis referred to as \"projection\".\nSmall eigenvalues of Hw occur quite frequently on (quenched) lattices used in current\nsimulations. Indeed, a non-zero density of eigenvalues near zero has been found [13]. Projection is thus essential in efficient implementations of the overlap Dirac operator. It is\nknown that the zero eigenvalues of Hw correspond to unit eigenvalues of the transfer matrix\nT that describes propagation along the fifth direction for domain wall fermions [2]. The\nleft and right handed physical fermions in the domain wall formulation occur along the two\nboundaries in the fifth direction. A unit eigenvalue of the transfer matrix then allows for\nunsuppressed interaction between left and right handed fermions and thus to a breaking\n\n1 Using\n\nthe scaling invariance \u01eb(sH) = \u01eb(H) for any positive scale factor s the upper range of the\nspectrum of H can always be scaled to be in the range of good accuracy of the approximation to\n\u01eb(x).\n\n2\n\n\fof chiral symmetry. Therefore the same modes that make the approximation of \u01eb(H) difficult to achieve in overlap fermions, and need to be projected, are responsible for the chiral\nsymmetry breaking for domain wall fermions at finite Ls .\nIf we could project out the modes with near unit eigenvalue of the transfer matrix and\ntake their contribution with effectively infinite Ls we could obtain a domain wall fermion\naction with no chiral symmetry breaking even at finite Ls . This would make domain wall\nfermions with finite Ls equivalent to overlap fermions. It would then become a matter of\ncomputational efficiency as to which form is to be preferred for numerical simulations. Based\non ideas of Bori\u00e7i [14] we show in section II how projection for domain wall fermions can be\nachieved. In section III we illustrate how projection works, first on smooth instanton configurations and then on a configuration from a quenched simulation. We discuss the degree\nof chiral symmetry conservation that can be achieved and compare the performance (cost)\nof domain wall fermion implementations with and without projection to overlap fermions.\nWe conclude the paper with a brief summary and some discussions in section IV.\nII. PROJECTED DOMAIN WALL FERMION ACTIONS\n\nKaplan's method [1] realizes a single massless fermion field through an infinite tower (or\ninfinite number of flavors) of massive fermion fields with a particular flavor structure. The\nflavor index can be interpreted as an extra (here fifth) dimension, and the flavor structure\nas a defect along the fifth dimension to which the massless fermions are bound. Lattice\ncalculations necessarily require a finite fifth dimensional extent and lattice spacing, as well\nas regularizations for the derivatives in the four dimensional space and in the fifth direction.\nThese regularizations are not unique. In particular, higher order terms in the fifth dimensional lattice spacing can be added to the action, as long as they do not change the \"defect\nstructure\". Such changes can affect the effective four dimensional theory by altering the\ndiscretization effects in the four dimensional lattice spacing, but not the continuum limit.\nThe finite fifth dimensional extent induces some chiral symmetry violation. This can be\neliminated by \"projecting\" an appropriate number of violation inducing states. We show\nhow the projection method can be implemented for two different five dimensional domain\nwall actions. The Wilson fermion action is used for the four dimensional part of the action,\nbut it should be understood that other actions realizing a single massive fermion field could\nbe considered, and much of the following derivations do not depend on the specific form\nchosen.\nA. Form of the actions\n\nTo fix our notation/conventions, we write the usual, 4-d, Wilson-Dirac operator as\n4\n\ni\n1 Xh\nDw (M) = (4 + M)\u03b4x,y \u2212\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3\u03bc )U\u03bc (x)\u03b4x+\u03bc,y + (1 + \u03b3\u03bc )U\u03bc\u2020 (y)\u03b4x,y+\u03bc\n2 \u03bc=1\n\u0012\n\u0013\nB+M\nC\n=\n.\n\u2212C \u2020 B + M\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fHere, with \u03c3\u03bc = (\u03c3k , i1),\n4\n\ni\n1X h\nC=\n\u03c3\u03bc U\u03bc (x)\u03b4x+\u03bc,y \u2212 U\u03bc\u2020 (y)\u03b4x,y+\u03bc ,\n2 \u03bc=1\n4\n\nB=\n\ni\n1 Xh\n2\u03b4x,y \u2212 U\u03bc (x)\u03b4x+\u03bc,y \u2212 U\u03bc\u2020 (y)\u03b4x,y+\u03bc .\n2 \u03bc=1\n\nWe are using a chiral basis: \u03b3\u03bc =\nWilson-Dirac operator\n\n\u0012\n\n(3)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 \u03c3\u03bc\n1 0\n, \u03b35 =\n.

Let's call the entries in\nthe first column Y1 , Y2, . . . , YLs . Since these 5-d matrices are the inverse of each other, their\nproduct is the 5-d unit matrix, i.e.\nY1 X1 = 1 \u21d2 Y1 = (X1 )\u22121\nY2 X1 + X2 = 0 \u21d2 Y2 = \u2212X2 (X1 )\u22121\n..\n..\n.\n.\nYj X1 + Xj = 0 \u21d2 Yj = \u2212Xj (X1 )\u22121 for j = 1, . . . , Ls .\nThe first equation, Y1 = (X1 )\u22121 establishes the relation we are looking for\nn\no\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121 (5)\nDov (m) = P \u22121 D (5) (1)\nD (m)P\n.\n11\n\n(49)\n(50)\n\n(51)\n\nNote that the components of the 5-d propagator used for the inverse of the overlap Dirac\noperator in eq. (41) do not correspond to the physical quark propagator hq q\u0304i as obtained from\ndomain wall fermions. The reason is that the overlap propagator still needs a subtraction\nof a contact term and a multiplicative normalization [12]. We consider here the standard\ndomain wall action without projection, and denote the corresponding 4-d Dirac operator\nDtov (m; HT ). To make the connection between the subtracted 4-d propagator and hq q\u0304i\nexplicit, we write the 1 for the subtraction as\n\u001a\n\u001b\nh\ni\u22121\n(5)\n(5)\n\u22121\n1= P\nDDW (m)\nDDW (m)P\n(52)\n11\n\n10\n\n\fand thus\n\u22121\nDtov\n(m; HT )\n\n\u22121=\n\n\u001a\n\nP\n\n\u22121\n\nh\ni\u22121 h\ni \u001b\n(5)\n(5)\n(5)\nDDW (m)\nDDW (1) \u2212 DDW (m) P\n.\n\n(53)\n\n11\n\n(5)\n\nFrom the matrix for DDW , eq.

Eigenvalues of the pseudo-fermion operators\n\nHere, we want to investigate a little more the properties of the pseudo-fermions, needed\nto cancel the bulk contributions in the 5-d domain wall fermion approaches.\nFor both the standard domain wall fermion action (5) and for Bori\u00e7i's variant (9) we\nfind for the pseudo-fermion matrix, including the boundary conditions and recalling that\nthe projection operator \u00c2(1) vanishes,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX Y 0 0 * * * 0 0 \u2212Y\n\uf8ec Y X Y 0 *** 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 Y X Y *** 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nD (5) (1)D (5)\u2020 (1) = \uf8ec .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. \uf8f7\n(60)\n\uf8ec . . . . . . . . \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0 0 0 0 *** Y X Y \uf8f8\n\u2212Y 0 0 0 * * * 0 Y X\n\nwith X and Y 4-d hermitian matrices,\n\n\u0001\n1\na5 Dw + a5 Dw\u2020 + 2\n2\n\u2020\n2\n\u2020\nX = D+ D+ + 1 = a5 Dw Dw \u2212 2Y\n\u2020\nY = \u2212P+ D+ \u2212 D+\nP\u2212 = \u2212\n\n(61)\n\nfor the standard domain wall action, and\n\u2020\n\u2020\nY = D+ P + D\u2212\n+ D\u2212 P \u2212 D+\n= a25 Dw Dw\u2020 \u2212 1\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\nX = D+ D+\n+ D\u2212 D \u2212\n= 2a25 Dw Dw\u2020 + 2 = 4a25 Dw Dw\u2020 \u2212 2Y\n\n(62)\n\nfor Bori\u00e7i's variant. Similar relations can be found in Ref. [17].\nNow, let S be the shift (or translation) operator in the 5-th direction with anti-periodic\nboundary condition:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 1 0 ... 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 0 1 . . . 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec .. .. .. .. .. .. \uf8f7\n(63)\nS = \uf8ec . . . . . .\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0 0 0 . . . 0 1\uf8f8\n\u22121 0 0 . . . 0 0\n\nIt is easy to see that [S, D (5) (1)D (5)\u2020 (1)] = 0, and so S and D (5) (1)D (5)\u2020 (1) can be diagonalized simultaneously. The eigenvalues of S are exp{i\u03c0(2k + 1)/Ls } for k = 0, . . . , Ls \u2212 1,\nbecause of the anti-periodic boundary conditions. The corresponding eigenvectors are\nw(k)T =\n(64)\n(v4 , v4 exp{i\u03c0(2k + 1)/Ls }, v4 exp{i\u03c02(2k + 1)/Ls }, . . . , v4 exp{i\u03c0(Ls \u2212 1)(2k + 1)/Ls })T\nwith v4 some 4-d vector. This also has to be an eigenvector of D (5) (1)D (5)\u2020 (1).

Since the left-hand-side\nof (65) remains unchanged under k \u2192 Ls \u2212 k \u2212 1 we conclude that \u03bb(Ls \u2212 k \u2212 1) = \u03bb(k).\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of D (5) (1)D (5)\u2020 (1) are all (at least) doubly degenerate.\nFurthermore, for large Ls and small k the pseudo-fermion domain wall eigen\u2020\nvalues\nh closely\n\u0010 track the\n\u0011i Wilson eigenvalues, the eigenvalues of Dw Dw , since then\n2Y 1 \u2212 cos L\u03c0s (2k + 1)\n\u2248 Y \u03c0 2 (2k + 1)2 /L2s in (65) is only a small perturbation. In\nparticular, at zero crossings of the Wilson Dirac operator, a pair of pseudo-fermion domain\nwall eigenvalues will go to zero for Ls \u2192 \u221e.\n(5)\nFrom the domain wall Dirac operator DDW (m) without the projection matrix \u00c2(m), we\n(5)\n(5)\ncan make a hermitian version, HDW (m) = DDW (m)J \u03b35 , with Jij = \u03b4i,Ls +1\u2212j the inversion\noperator of the fifth direction.

To get the eigenvalues of HDW (1) we need to compute\n(5)\nthe 2 \u00d7 2 matrix hw(k1)|HDW (1)|w(k2)i with k1 , k2 = k, Ls \u2212 k \u2212 1.

Preconditioning\n\nEven-odd preconditioning is a common technique to reduce the condition number of a\nmatrix [18] and can be implemented in both versions of the domain wall actions discussed\n13\n\n\fabove.

In Bori\u00e7i's variant the nearest neighbor coupling in the fifth direction contains also\nhoppings in the spatial directions leading to a complicated even-odd structure. This case\nwill not be discussed further here. For preconditioning of the standard domain wall action\n(5)\nwith projection, after a rescaling of the fermion fields to bring DDW into the \"kappa\"-form,\ni.e., having 1 in the diagonal except for the projection matrix \u00c2, we have\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 \u2212 \u00c2ee P\u2212 0 * * * 0 \u2212\u00c2eo P+\n\uf8ec\n0\n1 *** 0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n..\n.. .. ..\n..\n(71)\nAEE = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 .\n.\n. . .\n.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0\n0 *** 1\n0 \uf8f8\n0\n0 *** 0\n1\nHere \u00c2 is rescaled by 2\u03ba, with \u03ba = 1/(2(a5 (4 + M) + 1)), and e and o refer to the even and\nodd sub-lattice in the 4-d checker-boarding.\nFor even-odd preconditioning, we need\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n(1 \u2212 \u00c2ee P\u2212 )\u22121 0 * * * 0 (1 \u2212 \u00c2ee P\u2212 )\u22121 \u00c2eo P+\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n1 *** 0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n.. .. ..\n..\nA\u22121\n=\n(72)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 .\n.\n. . .\n.\nEE\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0\n0 *** 1\n0\n0\n0 *** 0\n1\nTherefore, for every application of the projected domain wall Dirac operator, the inversion\n(1 \u2212 \u00c2ee P\u2212 )\u22121 \u03c6 for some 4-d even sub-lattice fermion \u03c6 has to be performed once - the\n14\n\n\ftwo occurrences in A\u22121\nEE can be combined into the application on one 4-d even sub-lattice\nfermion field. In the limit of the fermion mass m \u2192 1, the matrices A\u22121\nEE and AOO become\nthe unit matrix. For small m, the matrix (1 \u2212 \u00c2ee P\u2212 ) should be well conditioned, and the\ncost of inversion is the number of iterations involving applications of Dw on half of the four\nvolume. This \"inner\" iteration cost is a multiplicative overhead on the cost of inverting D\u0303 (5) .\nF. Dynamical fermions\n\nImplementing an HMC algorithm for dynamical domain wall fermion simulations is a\nstraightforward modification of dynamical Wilson fermion simulation code. Implementing\nprojection does not cause any fundamental difficulties. What is needed, in addition to the\nusual case, for the computation of the fermion contribution to the force is \u2202 \u00c2(m; H(U))/\u2202U,\nwhere we indicated the implicit dependence on U of the projection operator \u00c2. Using the\nchain rule, what we need is\n\u2202\u03bbi\n\u2202U\n\nand\n\n\u2202 P\u0302i\n\u2202vi \u2020\n\u2202vi\u2020\n=\nv + vi\n,\n\u2202U\n\u2202U i\n\u2202U\n\n(73)\n\nfor H(U)vi = \u03bbi vi with vi\u2020 vi = 1.

For the\nstandard domain wall fermion action, where H = HT , additional 4-d inversions are needed\nT (U )\nto compute \u2202H\u2202U\n.\nWe note that the modifications involving projection for the force term may not be necessary in practice. The unprojected action can be used to construct the guiding Hamiltonian\nfor HMC with the projected action used for the computation of the initial and final energies\nin the Metropolis accept/reject step. A critical factor in the choice will be the acceptance\nrate which will suffer if the guiding Hamiltonian is not accurate enough without projection.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Smooth gauge field\n\nWe start our analysis by first considering the case of spectral flow on a smooth SU(2)\ninstanton configuration. We use the instanton construction from ref. [19], namely a single\n84 instanton with \u03c1 = 1.5 and anti-periodic boundary conditions. In this section we will\nmainly focus on the standard domain wall operator. Similar results are found for the Bori\u00e7i\nvariant.\n15\n\n\fWhat we are interested in is first determining how various domain-wall like actions\nreproduce topology on the lattice. Without projection, we note that the index of the massless\nfour dimensional (4-d) operator is\n\u0001\n1\nQ = Tr(\u03b35 Dtov ) = Tr \u03b5Ls /2 (a5 H(\u2212M))\n2\n\n(76)\n\nwith the auxiliary Hamiltonian H given by either HT or Hw - the two cases under consideration. For infinite Ls , \u03b5Ls /2 becomes \u01eb and Q is a measure of the discrepancy of positive and\nnegative states of H. A simple way to determine Q is to start from some M where we know\nthat Q = 0 and increase it to the desired value while counting the change of the number\nof positive states. We emphasize that this procedure works as long as the spectral flow is\nsmooth - namely, as long as the eigenvalues of H are well behaved. While Hw is always\nwell behaved, we note that this is not the case for the domain wall HT (\u2212M) for M > 2. In\nparticular, the spectral flow method will fail for M in the \"doubler\" region where there are\nmultiple species of chiral fermions. We will address this point in more detail later.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the spectral flow of the lowest 10 eigenvalues of the hermitian WilsonDirac operator Hw (\u2212M), the lowest 10 eigenvalues of the hermitian domain wall Dirac\n(5)\noperator J \u03b35 DDW (0) with a5 = 1 for various fifth dimensional extent values Ls , and the 10\nlowest eigenvalues of the hermitian overlap-Dirac operator (with projection, i.e. with chiral\nsymmetry), all as function of the \"domain wall height M\". We recall from eq. (51)\nn\no\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121 (5)\nDov (0) = P \u22121 D (5) (1)\nD (0)P\n(77)\n11\n\nthat when Dov (0) has zero-eigenvalues we can expect D (5) (0) to have zero-eigenvalues as\nlong as D (5) (1) is not singular. We see in Fig. 1 that there are exact zeros of Dov (0) for\nM beyond the crossing, and the spectrum changes discontinuously at the crossing [9]. For\n(5)\nfinite Ls , the DDW (0) eigenvalues decrease quickly in Ls . For M beyond the crossing they\nquickly go to zero and in fact appear exponential in Ls , but near the crossing, when the\neigenvalues of Hw are small, the decrease is slowed.\nThis slow rate of convergence in Ls , when the eigenvalues of Hw are small, is a prime\nsource of difficulty in recent numerical calculations involving domain wall fermions. The\nreason for the slow rate of convergence is clear when the form of the 4-d operator is examined,\ni\n1h\n(78)\nDtov (m) = 1 + m + (1 \u2212 m)\u03b35 \u03b5Ls /2 (a5 H) .\n2\nWhen \u03b5Ls/2 (a5 H) deviates from one, for example for the smallest and largest eigenvalues\nof H, there is violation of chiral symmetry. Fig. 2 shows the domain wall spectral flow\nwhen the 5 smallest (closest to zero) eigenvectors of HT are projected out as prescribed by\n(5)\neqs. (32),(33) and (34). With projection\nq turned on, DDW (0) no longer has (generalized) \u03b35\n(5)\n\n(5)\n\nhermiticity, so the eigenvalues of + (DDW (0))\u2020 DDW (0) are determined. We see that just\nbeyond the crossing there is a discontinuous drop of the eigenvalues to zero. In fact fairly\nsmall eigenvalues are seen even for Ls = 4. Also shown are the lowest eigenvalues of HT .\nWe see they agree quite well with the eigenvalues of Hw up to a factor of two as predicted\nby eq. (20).\n16\n\n\fAll computations of eigenvalues and eigenvectors where done with the Ritz method [20].\nFor computing eigenvectors of HT (\u2212M), in each Ritz iteration, the application of\nHT (\u2212M)\u2020 HT (\u2212M) on a vector is needed. From eq. (20) for HT , the expression for HT\u2020 HT\ncan be combined into\nHT\u2020 HT = \u03b35 Dw\n\n1\n(2 +\n\na5 Dw\u2020 )(2\n\n+ a5 Dw )\n\n\u03b3 5 Dw ,\n\n(79)\n\nso a single inversion of a hermitian positive definite operator is needed for each Ritz iteration and Conjugate Gradient for Normal Equations (CGNE) was used. Typically 30 to 60\niterations of CGNE were needed for each inversion to achieve an accuracy of 10\u22127 .\nIt should come as no surprise that zero eigenvalues of the domain wall operator can be\nobtained when projection is turned on since this is the same mechanism by which they are\nobtained for the overlap-Dirac operator [9]. What was key to the latter case was enough\nprojection coupled with a judicious choice of the fifth dimension spacing a5 . Since a5 only\nserves as a multiplicative scaling of Hw , a5 can be chosen so that the lowest unprojected\nand highest eigenvalues of Hw lie within the range of approximation of \u01eb. For the overlapDirac operator in Ref. [9], an optimal rational approximation was chosen; however, this\nmerely increased the useful range of the approximation. When the condition is met for a\nvalid approximation of \u01eb, there are no other cutoff effects associated with having a finite\na5 . For example, observables of the effective 4-d theory will not have slightly different 4-d\nlattice spacing dependencies for slightly different choices of a5 . However, for the conventional\ndomain wall action, HT intrinsically depends on a5 as seen in eq. (20). Therefore, even for\ninfinite extent in the fifth direction, where \u03b5(a5 HT ) converges to \u01eb(a5 HT ) = \u01eb(HT ), choosing\ndifferent a5 results in different 4-d lattice spacing dependence for physical observables. This\nfact limits the usefulness of adjusting a5 with the goal of imposing arbitrarily precise chiral\nsymmetry for (small) finite fifth dimension as will be shown later.\nIn Fig. 3 we examine more closely the smallest eigenvalue of the domain wall operator\nand the deviation of \u03b5(a5 HT ) from one for a5 = 1. We see that without projection the\neigenvalues decrease approximately exponentially in Ls with a slow rate varying with M,\nwhile with projection they drop to about 10\u22124 after the crossing. This is the accuracy to\nwhich the eigenvalues were computed in single precision and is \"zero\" here. For increasing\nM, the zero eigenvalues slowly increase.\nSome clue to the slow increase can be seen from the right panel in Fig. 3 which shows\nthe deviation from unity of \u03b5(\u03bbi ) where \u03bbi is the first, fifth and largest eigenvalue of HT .\nThe deviation for the fifth and the largest eigenvalue gives a measure of the accuracy of\nthe approximation since the first five eigenvalues are projected out of HT . The deviation of\nthe first eigenvalue indicates how much the standard unprojected case deviates. For Ls = 4\nthe deviation of the largest eigenvalue is clearly visible, and for Ls \u2265 8 the deviation is\noff the bottom of the graph until M approaches 2. For Ls = 8 a typical deviation of the\nfifth eigenvalue is about 1% while nonetheless a domain wall eigenvalue of 10\u22124 is obtained.\nHowever, as M is increased, the largest eigenvalue is not well approximated and the domain\nwall eigenvalue deviates away from zero due to the resulting chiral symmetry breaking.\nWe will conclude this portion of the analysis with a final look at the role of the pseudofermion term in eq. (51) (repeated again in eq. (77)). It was stated that zero eigenvalues\nof the 5-d D (5) (0) are seen when the 4-d Dov (0) has zero eigenvalues. However, as shown\n17\n\n\fin Sec. II D, the pseudo-fermion term has a zero eigenvalue in the infinite fifth dimensional\nextent limit at the zero crossings of Hw . We show in Fig. 4 the lowest eigenvalue of the hermitian version of the unprojected D (5) (0) and the pseudo-fermion operator D (5) (1) (recall\nthat the pseudo-fermion operator is unaffected by projection). The pseudo-fermion eigenvalues track the regular eigenvalues up to the crossing, then move away from zero again.\nAs Ls increases, the pseudo-fermion eigenvalues appear to go exponentially to zero. We\nsee then by studying eq. (77) that the pseudo-fermions cancel to some extent in the ratio\n(D (5) (1))\u22121 D (5) (0).\nFor the resultant unprojected 4-d operator Dtov (0) (finite Ls ), the eigenvalues are larger\nthan the corresponding 5-d ones and the 4-d eigenvalues decrease across a broad region in\nthe mass M. These eigenvalues are the actual ones occurring in 4-d observables like the pion\npropagator and the chiral condensate. More to the point, the eigenvalues of the 5-d operator\nD (5) (m) are in general not directly physically relevant to 4-d observables. Stated differently,\nthe eigenvectors or some piece of the eigenvectors of the D (5) (m) are not eigenvectors of\nDtov (m) because of the basis changing matrices P and the projection onto the first 5-d\nslice. However, eq. (77) gives us the connection between the 5-d and 4-d matrices and in\nfact provides a new algorithm to compute the relevant 4-d eigenvalues from only the 5-d\noperators. It has some attractive features for practical use because of its simplicity and\ndirect connection, but it is not really efficient for the reason that D (5) (1) has near zero\neigenvalues at Hw zero crossings and hence has bad condition numbers, at least in the large\nLs limit.\nWe proceed to another test of chiral symmetry given by the generalized Gellmann-OakesRenner relation (called GMOR by many authors). In the form used here and with our\nnormalization conventions [9], it states that\n\u22121\n\u22121\nm hb|(\u03b35 D\u0303ov\n(m))2 |bi = hb|D\u0303ov\n(m)|bi\n\n\u2200 \u03b35 |bi = \u00b1|bi ,\n\n(80)\n\nwith the physical (subtracted, see eq. (45)) fermion propagator\n\u22121\nD\u0303tov\n(m) =\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002 \u22121\nDtov (m) \u2212 1\n1\u2212m\n\n(81)\n\nand Ls taken to the infinite fifth dimensional limit. Averaging over several (chiral) Gaussian\nrandom vectors |bi, eq. (80) becomes a stochastic estimate for m\u03c7\u03c0 = h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i, which is the\nfamiliar Gellmann-Oakes-Renner relation. Eq. (80) holds configuration by configuration for\nany chiral state |bi. For finite fifth dimensional extent Ls , the relation is broken and a useful\nmeasure is the ratio\nR=m\n\n\u22121\nhb|(\u03b35 D\u0303tov\n(m))2 |bi\n.\n\u22121\nhb|D\u0303tov\n(m)|bi\n\n(82)\n\nThis ratio has been studied for domain wall fermions [21] where in quenched SU(3) configurations at \u03b2 = 5.85 and 5.7 significant deviations of the ratio from one are seen for fermion\nmasses on the order m = 0.01 and smaller. We argue that the larger violations seen at\n\u03b2 = 5.7 are due to the larger ensemble averaged density of zero eigenvalues of Hw (\u2212M) at\n\u03b2 = 5.7 compared to \u03b2 = 5.85 [13].\n18\n\n\fWe show in Fig. 5 a plot of the ratio R for the domain wall operator as a function of the\nfermion mass at a fixed M = 0.5 and a5 = 1 with the instanton background used in Fig. 1.\nThe mass M = 0.5 is just before the zero crossing of Hw (\u2212M). Without projection, the\ndeviation is large even for Ls = 32. With 5 eigenvalues projected, the deviation from unity\nis negligible for Ls = 16. For Ls = 8, the violation is large with 5 eigenvectors projected\nout and is not noticeably changed with 20 eigenvectors projected out. This is explained by\nnoticing in the right panel of Fig. 3 that for Ls = 8 the fifth eigenvalue shows a deviation of\n1\u2212|\u03b54 (\u03bb5 )| \u2248 0.01. What is not shown is that this value changes little at the 20th eigenvalue.\nWhat we are seeing is that by the 20th eigenvalue we are entering into a relatively dense band\nof eigenvalues of HT and they change slowly with increasing eigenvalue. Therefore, little is\ngained by projecting out more eigenvectors. By going to Ls = 16, 1 \u2212 |\u03b58 (\u03bb5 )| \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 is\nmuch reduced compared to Ls = 8, and hence all the volume modes contributing to R have\ndeviation less (or much less) than the worst case resulting in a small overall deviation of\nR from unity. Therefore, projection is quite effective at restoring chiral symmetry, and we\nsee that the GMOR test given by eq. (82) is a quite sensitive measure of chiral symmetry\nbreaking since it detected a deviation in the \u01eb approximation on order of 1%.\nWe finish up the discussion of the smooth field case by considering the case of M > 2\n(the doubler region). We continue the discussion initiated in Ref. [17] on the difference of\nthe overlap Dirac operator Dov (m; Hw ) and the 4-d version of the standard domain wall\noperator Dov (m; HT ).\nWe consider the free propagator with momentum near one of the corners\nP of the2 Brillouin\nzone, i.e., with p\u03bc = sin(p\u03bc ) \u226a 1 for all \u03bc. Set M(p) = M \u2212 B(p) = M \u2212 \u03bc 2 sin (p\u03bc /2) =\nMP\u22122n+O(p\u03bc 2 ), where n is the number of momentum components near \u03c0. Then Dw (\u2212M) =\ni \u03bc \u03b3\u03bc p\u03bc \u2212 M(p) and we find for the inverse free overlap propagator, up to terms of higher\norder in p\u03bc and m,\n\uf8f1\nP\n\u03b3\u03bc p +2mM (p)\n\uf8f22M(p) \u00d7 \u2212i\nP \u03bc2 \u03bc\nfor M(p) > 0\np\n+(2mM (p))2\n\u22121\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n(83)\nD\u0303ov (p, m) = \u2212i P \u03b3\u03bc p\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\uf8f3\nfor M(p) < 0 .\n2|M (p)|\n\nThis corresponds to a light free fermion propagator only for M(p) \u2248 M \u2212 2n > 0. For\n2 < M < 4, for example, the origin and the corners of the Brillouin zone with one momentum\ncomponent close to \u03c0 give light fermions, while for 0 < M < 2 only the origin gives a light\nfermion.\nFor free domain wall fermions, recalling the form of HT from eq. (20),\nHT (\u2212M) = \u03b35 Dw (\u2212M)\n\n1\n1\n.\n= \u03b35 Dw (\u2212M)\n2 + a5 Dw (\u2212M)\na5 Dw ( a25 \u2212 M)\n\n(84)\n\nwe find\n\"\n\nDT (\u2212M) = \u03b35 HT (\u2212M) = C(p) i\n\nX\n\u03bc\n\n1\n\u03b3\u03bc p\u03bc \u2212 M(p) (2 \u2212 a5 M(p))\n2\n\n#\n\n(85)\n\nwith C(p) positive, and hence unimportant in \u01eb(HT ). We see that for free domain wall\nfermions 12 M(p) (2 \u2212 a5 M(p)) plays the role of M(p) for overlap fermions. Hence, from\n19\n\n\feq. (83) we see that we need M(p) (2 \u2212 a5 M(p)) > 0 to have a light domain wall fermion.\nThese are exactly the conditions for a normalizable domain wall zero mode [17], \u22121 <\n1 \u2212 a5 M(p) < 1. The first inequality here is an additional condition for domain wall\nfermions, not present for overlap fermions. For 2 < M < 4 it excludes the origin of the\nBrillouin zone from giving a light fermion, as it did for overlap fermions.\nNow consider the interacting case. We know that zero crossings of Hw (\u2212M) = 0 also\ncorrespond to zero crossings of the domain wall HT (\u2212M) for all a5 . However, eq. (84)\nsuggests that HT (\u2212M) can have poles. Zero eigenvalues of Hw (\u2212M) at some M0 are also zero\neigenvalues of Dw (\u2212M0 ). From (84) we see that to each such zero eigenvalue is associated a\npole of HT (\u2212M) at M = M0 + 2/a5 . In other words, all zeros below M = 2 are replicated\nas poles at M + 2/a5 .\nFor the single instanton background shown in Fig. 1, there is one downward crossing in\nthe Wilson spectral flow at about M = 0.55. After M = 0.55, the domain wall and overlap\nDirac operators have index \u22121 and hence a single zero mode. For this one downward\ncrossing, there are 4 corresponding upward crossings at M = 2.17 and M = 2.30. After this\nlast crossing, the index of the Dirac operator is +3 and hence there are 3 zero modes. There\nare no other zeros of Hw (\u2212M) and hence HT (\u2212M) until M \u2248 4. The largest eigenvalue of\nHT (\u2212M) has a behavior as follows: Starting at M = 0, there is a near pairing of positive and\nnegative eigenvalues of the largest eigenvalue \u03bbmax ; however, a negative eigenvalue is slightly\nlargest in magnitude. As M increases, so does |\u03bbmax |. At M = 1.249 \u03bbmax reaches \u22121, giving\na zero eigenvalue for T \u22121 . This corresponds to B\u0303 in the transfer matrix T , eqs. (17) and\n(18), having a zero eigenvalue. In the free field case the domain wall mass at which T \u22121 has\na zero eigenvalue (namely M = 1) is identified as the mass where the domain walls (each end\nof the fifth dimension) have the least coupling for fixed Ls , i.e. this is the optimal domain\nwall mass. As M increases to the pole position of M = 2.55, the eigenvalue \u2212\u03bbmax diverges.\nThe pole is the mechanism by which the topology changes for as M increases beyond the\npole mass the largest eigenvalue flips sign and decreases from positive infinity. There is a\nnet increase in the number of positive states of HT (\u2212M) occurring in \u01eb(HT (\u2212M)) for the\n4-d domain wall Dirac operator Dov (0; HT (\u2212M)) and the index becomes +4 with four zero\nmodes.\nIn general then for the standard domain wall action in the smooth field case with a5 = 1,\nfor every crossing of Hw (\u2212M0 ) for M0 < 2, there are four opposite crossings around M \u2265 2\nand a pole of HT (\u2212M) at M = 2 + M0 . If at some mass M < 2 there is an index Q(M)\nthen Q(2 + M) = \u22124Q(M). For the overlap Dirac operator Dov (0; Hw (\u2212M)), however,\nQ(2 + M) = \u22123Q(M).\nVarying the fifth dimension lattice spacing a5 gives some freedom in improving the chiral\nsymmetry properties for the induced 4-d Dirac operators at finite Ls given in eq. (78). If at\nsome positive \u03bb\u2217 < 1 we have 1 \u2212 \u03b5Ls /2 (a5 \u03bb\u2217 ) < \u03b4 where \u03b4 is some prescribed accuracy, then\nthe range of accuracy is |\u03bb| in [\u03bb\u2217 , 1/(a25 \u03bb\u2217 )]. For the overlap Dirac operator with Hw (\u2212M),\nthe flexibility of rescaling by a gauge field dependent a5 coupled with projection helped\ninsure that all unprojected eigenvalues of Hw (\u2212M) where within some prescribed range of\naccuracy of |\u03b5Ls/2 (a5 \u03bbi )| approximating 1.\nFor the standard domain wall operator, HT (\u2212M) depends implicitly on a5 , and choosing\ndifferent values for a5 leads to different cut-off effects, just as choosing different values for M\ndoes. Therefore, both M and a5 need to be kept fixed in a given simulation. We saw in Fig. 3\n20\n\n\fthat even for moderate Ls the largest eigenvalue \u03bbmax of HT (\u2212M) was usually well within\nthe good approximation region of \u01eb(a5 \u03bb). Thus we would like to use an a5 > 1 to fully use\nthe region of good approximation to \u01eb. However, this can mix in doubler contributions, since\nfor each crossing at M0 < 2 there is the doubler pole of HT (\u2212M) at M = 2/a5 + M0 , and as\na5 increases the pole moves down to lower domain wall mass M. However, as can be seen\nin the right panel of Fig. 3 the deviation for the largest eigenvalue of HT becomes sizeable\nwell before the pole at M = 2/a5 + M0 is reached. This region of large deviation moves\ndown with increasing a5 and begins to conflict with our goal of increasing a5 to fully utilize\nthe region of good approximation to \u01eb. Since one needs to choose M sufficiently larger than\nthe Mc around which the physically important crossings, due to large instantons, occur, the\nchoice of a5 is quite limited. This is a fundamental limitation of the standard domain wall\noperator.\nB. Quenched gauge field\n\nWe now move on to the interesting case of a thermalized quenched SU(3) gauge field\nconfiguration. Fig. 6 shows the spectral flow of the hermitian domain wall and Wilson\noperators for a quenched SU(3) \u03b2 = 5.85, 83 \u00d7 32 configuration. Near M = 1.0, the Wilson\nflow has two crossings down and two crossings up that result in a zero index for M > 1.017.\nThere is a fifth crossing at about M0 = 1.86 resulting in an index of \u22121 for M greater\nthan this crossing mass. In the region around M = 1.0 where there is a non-zero index,\nthe domain wall eigenvalues do not go close to zero. Well into the region M > 1.017 where\nthe index is zero there are fairly small domain wall eigenvalues, but no dramatic drop of\nthe lowest eigenvalue is observed for M > M0 . The overlap Dirac operator, on the other\nhand, has zero modes whenever the index is non-zero. Fig. 7 shows the spectral flow of\nthe projected domain wall operator on the same configuration as in the Fig. 6, together\nwith the Wilson flow and the low-lying eigenvalues of 2HT . Near M = 1.0 and after the\nWilson crossing around 1.85 there are small (zero) eigenvalues of the projected domain wall\noperator.\nIn the left panel of Fig. 8 is shown the spectral flow of the lowest eigenvalue of the\nstandard domain wall operator for Ls = 10 and 30 and the Bori\u00e7i variant for Ls = 10 all for\na5 = 1. We see in Fig. 8 that a small (near) zero eigenvalue is obtained for Ls = 30 with\n(5)\nthe standard domain wall DDW (0). For Ls = 10, a drop is seen in the lowest eigenvalue for\n(5)\nM > M0 , down to the level of the Ls = 30 eigenvalue. For the Bori\u00e7i variant DDW \u2032 (0), a\nrelatively small eigenvalue is seen even for Ls = 10.\nThe explanation for the small eigenvalues of the Bori\u00e7i variant even at Ls = 10 can be seen\nin the right panel of Fig. 8 which shows the accuracy of the |\u03b5Ls/2 (\u03bbi )| approximating 1. The\nlowest eigenvalues of HT (\u2212M) are about half those of Hw (\u2212M). Hence for the domain wall\nfermion action with Ls = 10 and M = 1.65 we find 1 \u2212 |\u03b55 (\u03bb20 )| \u2248 0.25 while for the Bori\u00e7i\nvariant using Hw (\u2212M) the deviation is about 0.3%. The largest eigenvalue of HT (\u22121.65) is\nabout 1.13 hence the deviation is below the range in the graph even for Ls = 10. For the\nBori\u00e7i variant, the largest eigenvalue of Hw (\u22121.65) is 5.82 and there is about 6% deviation.\nWhile the condition number is smaller for HT (\u22121.65) than Hw (\u22121.65), the eigenvalues are\nplaced more optimally around one for Hw which results in overall smaller deviations of\n21\n\n\f|\u03b5Ls /2 (\u03bbi )| from 1. For this configuration, there is not much need for rescaling the Wilson\nHw eigenvalues by a5 since a5 = 1 is close to optimal. For the standard domain wall action,\na larger a5 would lower the deviations of |\u03b5Ls/2 (a5 \u03bbi )| from 1 for this configuration. However,\nas explained in the previous sub-section, choosing an a5 > 1 might not be desirable, since\nit could lead to large deviations (due to the proximity of poles) for other configurations in\na simulation.\n(5)\n(5)\nFig. 8 shows that small eigenvalues of the domain wall fermion actions DDW and DDW \u2032\ncan be easily achieved using projection and the cost of the projection is justified. To achieve\nthe same small eigenvalue without projection would require Ls \u226b 30.\nIn Fig. 9 is shown the ratio R defined from the generalized Gellmann-Oakes-Renner\nrelation (GMOR) in (82) using M = 1.65, a5 = 1 and the same configuration as in Fig. 8.\nFor the standard domain wall action, not much is gained from projection for Ls = 10 and\nviolations of the relation are large. For Ls = 30, projection significantly improves chiral\nsymmetry resulting in small violations of the relation while there are large deviations for\neven this large Ls without projection. The Bori\u00e7i variant also shows similar improvement\nwith increasing Ls .\nThe condition number of a fermionic operator is a useful measure of its convergence\nproperties in solving linear systems of equations, and can be used to construct a bound on\nthe number of iterations for convergence in some iterative methods. The condition number\ndefined here is \u03bbmax /\u03bbmin where \u03bbi \u2265 0 is defined from D \u2020 Dvi = \u03bb2i vi . The condition numbers\nof the various fermion operators are shown in Fig. 10. The parameters are chosen the same\nas for the GMOR test in Fig. 9. The condition number of the overlap Dirac operator\nDov (m; Hw ) is much smaller than the 5-d methods. The condition number of the standard\n(5)\ndomain wall operator DDW is larger for Ls = 30 compared to Ls = 10 while the Bori\u00e7i\n(5)\nvariant is roughly the same for both Ls values, but higher than that of DDW . Projection\nalso does not affect the condition numbers much basically because for this configuration at\nmass M = 1.65, there should be no zero modes and the smallest eigenvalue of D (5) is not\nstrongly affected by projection as can be seen in Fig. 8. The reason the 4-d operator has\nmuch smaller condition number is due to the largest eigenvalue which for Dov (m) is very\nclose to 1, while for D (5) it is roughly 10.\nPerformance tests and comparisons of the various fermion actions are shown in Fig. 11.\nThe left panel shows the iteration count for the benchmark Conjugate-Gradient for Normal\nEquations (CGNE) algorithm to achieve a residual accuracy of 10\u22125 normalized by the\nsource norm for the linear system D \u2020 D\u03c6 = D \u2020 b. The configuration parameters are those of\nthe GMOR test in Fig. 9. The average and the standard error of the data (not the mean)\nis derived from the 12 source color and spin inversions necessary to compute a fermion\npropagator. For the 4-d case (exact chiral symmetry not necessary), we note that a single\ninversion could be used for all the fermion masses m used in Fig. 11 with the convergence\ngoverned by the time required for the smallest fermion mass. The 4-d overlap Dirac operator\nDov (m) has a low iteration count requiring about 320 CG iterations for convergence at m = 0.\n(5)\nWithout preconditioning, the standard domain wall operator DDW (m) requires roughly 1000\niterations for convergence at Ls = 10 and there is a strong Ls dependence as expected from\nthe condition number. Preconditioning reduces the condition numbers by about a factor\nof three. The Bori\u00e7i variant requires correspondingly more iterations for convergence. All\n22\n\n\fthese results are consistent with a linear scaling in the condition number.\nIt has been pointed out [14,22] that both CGNE and Conjugate-Residual are optimal\nalgorithms for the overlap-Dirac operator with exact chiral symmetry. In principle the\nConjugate-Residual method would be more desirable since only one Dov (m) application is\nneeded per iteration. For CGNE one expects two applications of Dov (m), but this can be\nrewritten as only one application of \u01eb(Hw ) on a vector [12], so the work is the same per\niteration for both methods. However, it was found that Conjugate-Residual had clearly\nworse convergence in practice compared to CGNE and was not used.\nThe right panel of Fig. 11 shows the actual cost for convergence measured in total number\nof Dw applications for each linear system solution. This includes the \"inner\" CG portion\nfor the 4-d overlap Dirac operator. For each \"outer\" CG iteration, a single application of\n\u01eb(Hw ) is needed on a vector [9]. This inner CG iteration in turn involves multiplications of\na vector with Hw2 . For the standard domain wall operator, there are 2Ls applications of Dw\nneeded per iteration. For the Bori\u00e7i variant, there are 3Ls applications of Dw needed as can\n(5)\n(5)\nbe seen from the form of DDW \u2032 (m) and (DDW \u2032 (m))\u2020 in eqs. (10) and (58).\nThe cost of the methods can be roughly characterized as follows: the Bori\u00e7i variant\nrequires about twice as many Dw applications for a given Ls compared to the standard\ndomain wall operator with and without projection. This can be expected from the slightly\nlarger condition number (mainly from the largest eigenvalue) and the 50% overhead in Dw\napplications. Preconditioning saves the domain wall operator roughly a factor of two to\nthree for both Ls values with and without projection. This decrease is mainly due to the\nreduction of the largest eigenvalue. The Ls = 30 calculations require about three to four\ntimes as many Dw applications as the Ls = 10 calculations with and without projection.\nHowever, Ls = 30 and projection is needed to pass the GMOR test successfully.\nThe inversion of (1 \u2212 \u00c2ee P\u2212 ) in eq. (72) requires only about three iterations of a Minimal Residual algorithm to reach an accuracy of 10\u22127. This multiplicative overhead in the\nnumber of \"outer\" CG iterations, but not proportional to Ls , is included in the total cost of\nthe preconditioned domain wall operator and results in about an 18% overhead for Ls = 10\nand a 5% overhead for Ls = 30 - there is little Ls dependence in the \"inner\" CG. However,\nfor these parameters and configuration (topological index is zero) the projected preconditioned domain wall requires fewer CGNE iterations for convergence, and is less costly in Dw\napplications for Ls = 30 than the unprojected version.\nFor Ls = 30 with preconditioning and projection, the standard domain wall operator\nis about three times less costly in Dw applications than the 4-d overlap Dirac operator.\nHowever, given that with the 4-d overlap Dirac operator all the masses for this spectroscopic\ncalculation can be computed simultaneously for a given color and spin source, the cost benefit\nof the two approaches is comparable.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe five dimensional domain wall fermion action provides a means whereby an effective\nchiral theory may be obtained. Upon integrating out extra modes (which may be interpreted\nas flavors) from this extra fifth dimension, a chiral theory is obtained in four dimensions.\nFor finite fifth dimensional extent Ls , the form of this action in four dimensions is\n23\n\n\fDtov (m; HT ) =\n\ni\n1h\n1 + m + (1 \u2212 m)\u03b35 \u03b5Ls /2 (a5 HT )\n2\n\n(86)\n\nwith the auxiliary Hamiltonian HT . When Ls \u2192 \u221e, \u03b5Ls /2 (a5 HT ) \u2192 \u01eb(HT ) for a5 > 0\nand there is a chiral symmetry in the action. For finite Ls , chiral symmetry breaking is\ninduced because \u03b5Ls/2 (a5 HT ) deviates from one. These deviations occur whenever the range\nof eigenvalues of HT are outside the range of approximation of \u03b5Ls/2 (x) to \u01eb(x). Deviations\ncan occur for both large and small eigenvalues of HT .\nSection II shows how the domain wall operator and a variant can be straightforwardly\nmodified to allow arbitrarily precise chiral symmetry at finite values of Ls . The domain\nwall operator as shown in eq. (10) has only two new entries corresponding to projection of\neigenvalues of HT or Hw . When the \u03c7 basis is chosen for the fermions fields in the action,\neq. (21), the projection term occurs only in the origin along the fifth dimensional line (the\nflavor index). With this special position, the projection term is unmodified by the successive\nintegrations of the extra flavor fermion fields. After extraction of the pseudo-fermion term,\nthe expected form of the 4-d fermion action is obtained with the projection term acting as\n(part) of the spectral decomposition of \u01eb(a5 H). In principle then one can see that once in\nthe \u03c7 basis the projection term could account for the entire spectrum of H and the fifth\ndimensional extent could be set to one!\nAll the normal relations involving the fermion propagator go through with projection,\nand we have the relation connecting the 5-d and 4-d operators in eq. (51) and the propagator\nin eq. (45) valid with and without projection.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to show how projection can be used to achieve exact\nchiral symmetry at finite fifth dimensional extent. The method is not limited to quenched\ncalculations and methods were outlined in Section II F for use in dynamical fermion calculations. Even-odd preconditioning is practical and for moderate Ls is a small overhead. Tests\nof chiral symmetry were made for a smooth gauged field background composed of a single\ninstanton, and for a quenched SU(3) gauge field background. Small (zero) eigenvalues of the\nDirac operator can be achieved given careful control of the range of the approximation of\nthe eigenvalues of the auxiliary Hamiltonian and choice of Ls . A stringent simple test is the\ngeneralized Gellmann-Oakes-Renner relation (GMOR) from eq. (80) and projection appears\nessential to pass this test.\nHowever, for practical simulations the requirement of no induced chiral symmetry breaking may not be necessary or easy to achieve. In this case, the amount of projection and the\nfifth dimensional length can be tuned. This may well be necessary anyway since as shown\nfor quenched backgrounds, there is evidence [13] for a non-zero density of zero eigenvalues\n\u03c1(0; H) of the auxiliary Hamiltonian Hw (and hence HT ) for a large range of \u03b2. If one wants\nto go to very large lattice volume, the number of eigenvalues for projection to achieve some\ngiven accuracy for \u03b5Ls/2 (a5 H) grows like the 4-d lattice volume. For example, this cost is\nan additional overhead for a spectroscopy calculation which also grows like the 4-d lattice\nvolume. One way to lessen the overhead is to use a weaker coupling since \u03c1(0; H) decreases\nvery rapidly with the coupling which of course may require a larger lattice volume to hold\nthe physical volume fixed. To keep calculation costs down, Ls can be chosen suitably small\nand measures of induced chiral symmetry breaking like PCAC [7] can be used. No effort\nwas made to quantify this for given parameters like \u03b2, however, some projection is expected\n24\n\n\fto reduce the induced chiral symmetry breaking from finite Ls .\nFor a given calculation, one would like to know what ultimately is the most efficient\nmethod to use. Namely, is the 5-d or the direct 4-d method the most efficient? From the\npresent work, when one enforces chiral symmetry there is not really a huge difference in the\ncost of any of the methods tested. Quite likely then the answer depends on what one wants to\ndo and on ones taste. For eigenvalue calculations of spectral quantities, the 4-d eigenvalues\nare needed. For spectroscopy or dynamical fermion calculations, either 5-d or 4-d methods\ncan be used. For fixed cutoff dependence, the 5-d domain wall operator is preferable to\nthe 4-d methods using \u01eb(a5 HT ) \u2013 the nontrivial cost of applying HT within an inner CG\niteration inside of another inner CG iteration is prohibitive. For 4-d eigenvalue calculations\n(5)\nthe application of Dov (m; HT ) from DDW (m) in eq. (51) is probably most efficient. For\n(5)\nthe overlap Dirac case using Dov (m; Hw ), the Bori\u00e7i variant of DDW \u2032 (m) does not appear\ncompetitive for spectroscopy calculations. A multi-grid implementation in the fifth direction\nmight help [14], but has not been tested here. Other 5-d methods should be tried and\ntested [23].\n(5)\nFor a direct comparison of the standard domain wall action DDW (m) and the overlap\noperator Dov (m), one first must answer just how important is chiral symmetry? Projection\nis essential for realizing good chiral symmetry properties for small quark masses and moderate Ls . Clearly computing eigenvectors using Hw is much more efficient than computing\neigenvectors of HT . If one enforces chiral symmetry the un-preconditioned domain wall operators is about the same cost in the number of Dw applications as the overlap operator.\nPreconditioning saves about a factor of three in cost, however the methods are comparable\nin cost for a spectroscopy calculation when multiple fermion masses are needed. A benefit\nof the 5-d method is that it gives a simple handle Ls in which to reduce the overall cost\nwhile incurring some acceptably small amount of induced chiral symmetry breaking.\nRGE was supported by DOE contract DE-AC05-84ER40150 under which the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) operates the Thomas Jefferson National\nAccelerator Facility (TJNAF).
