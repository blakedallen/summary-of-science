Within this hypothesis one can\nnaturally explain the main anomalous features of\nMCP stars: first of all, an existence of the short-lived\nradioactive isotopes detected in some stars (like\nPrzybylski's star and HR465), and some others peculiarities (e.g. the behavior of CU Vir in radio range,\nthe phenomenon of the roAp stars).\n\n2. MCP stars: the main features\nThe main characteristics of MCP stars are the following:\n1. MCP stars show periodic variations of the light,\nspectrum and magnetic field. It is believed that these\nvariations are due to the rotation of the star. MCP\nstars has been regarded as rigid magnetic dipoles with\nrespect to the rotation axis (Babcock, 1949; Stibss,\n1950). In the later works it was obtained that MCP\nstars can be stars with a multi-pole magnetic field\n(Landstreet, 1990; Mathys, 1991).\n2. Some MCP stars are the source of radio emission\n(Drake et al., 1987). The flat spectra and variability of\nradio emission on time scales as short as a few hours,\nas well as the well known strong magnetic field indicate\na nontermnal gyrosynchrotron emission process (Lynsky et al., 1989). Later Lynsky (Lynsky et al., 1992)\nremarked, that all observed properties of radio emission from these stars may be understood as optically\nthick gyrosynchrotron emission from a nonthermal distribution of electron emitters. The radio luminosities\nof MCP stars are correlated with effective temperature\nand magnetic field strength (Drake et al., 1994).\n3. Some MCP stars are detected as X-ray sources\n(Drake et al., 1994). They have been investigated during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. Drake (1998) emphasized that only 10 X-ray sources detected at the positions of 100 magnetic Bp-Ap stars.\n4. Shore & Brown (1990) showed that MCP are characterized by an anisotropic stellar wind. MCP stars\nhave been known to have moderate circular polarization (Drake et al., 2002). Trigilio et al. (2000) showed\nthat only CU Vir (Si-star) have a strong 1.4 GHz flux\nenhancement around phases 0.4 and 0.8, with a right\ncircular polarization of almost 100%. Leto et al., (2007)\nremarked that only MCP star with a high photospheric\n\nKey words: Przybylski's star, HR465, close binary\nsystem, roAp star, neutron star, pulsar, magnetar.\n1. Introduction\nIt is known that about 10-15% of upper main sequence stars have atmospheres with anomalies in elemental abundance (Bagnulo, 2002). These stars are\noften classified as magnetic chemically peculiar stars\n(MCP, or Bp-Ap stars) and nonmagnetic (Hg-Mn and\nAm-Fm) stars. Hg-Mn stars have a higher temperature than MCP stars and overlap with MCP stars in\nthe region of the higher temperatures, while Am-Fm\nstars have the lower temperatures than MCP stars.\nAmong the MCP stars one can select the following\nsubclasses (Kurtz & Martinez, 2000):\n1. SrCrEu stars (spectral classes A3-F0).\n2. Si stars(B8-A2).\n3. He-weak, Si, SrTi stars (B3-B7).\n4. He-strong stars (B1-B2).\nSome of the peculiarities seen in the chemically\npeculiar stars can be explained by considering different non-nuclear processes first proposed by Michaud\n(1970) and then elaborated in a series of the subse1\n\n\f2\ntemperature develop a radiative-driven stellar wind,\nwhich is the cause of the radio emission.\n5. Among MCP stars there is known the phenomenon of roAp-stars. roAp stars are the main sequence SrCrEu chemically peculiar stars from mid-A\nto early-F, which pulsate with periods in the range\nof 5-16 min and amplitudes > 0.016 mag (Kurtz &\nMartinez, 2000). The mechanisms responsible for an\nexistent of the roAp star pulsations remain unknown.\nHD101065 is the first Ap star where pulsations were\ndetected. Kurtz & Wegner (1979) detected the welldefined pulsations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of\n0.012 mag and a period of 12.14 min (Kurtz & Wegner, 1979).\n6.\nThe most unusual feature is the chemical\ncomposition of MCP stars. The first studies of the\nabundance anomalies in magnetic stars \u03b12 CVn,\nHD133029, HD151199 showed that there can be the\ncertain nuclear reactions in the star (Burbidge et\nal., 1958). Now it is accepted that detected overand/or under-abundance of some elements do not\nreflect the chemical composition of the entire star, but\nonly its photosphere. There are the most extremal\ncases among the MCP stars. For example HD101065\nwith its chemical composition is the most unusual\nroAp star. The star HD101065 in fact is the unique\nastrophysical laboratory for understanding and exploring the extreme phenomena of the stellar evolution.\nThis stars shows the high lithium abundance, as well\nas unusual isotopic lithium ratio (Shavrina et all.,\n2000). The presence of the short-lived lanthanide\npromethium Z = 61 was noted by Wagner & Petford\n(1973), Cowley et al. (2004), Fivet et al. (2007). The\nlines of some short-lived transbismuth isotopes were\ndetected by Gopka et al. (2004), Gopka et al. (2005),\nBidelman (2005), Quinet et al. (2007). Cowley &\nHubrig (2002), Cowley et al. (2007) found anomalous\nisotopic ratio of Ca in the HD101065 atmosphere.\n3.\nAbout nucleosynthesis on the stellar\natmosphere\nThe idea about the possibility of the nucleosynthesis\nin the stellar atmosphere is not new. In the mid of\npast century the first papers concerning the chemical\ncomposition of Ap stars showed that overabundance\nof heavy elements really exist. In some cases overabundance of some elements can reach 6 dex and more\ncomparing to the solar abundance. E.M. Burbidge and\nG.R. Burbidge wrote: \"The list of elements with the\nincreased content led us to the thought, that in this\ncase we deal with the nuclear, not with atomic processes and that somewhere and somehow the neutrons\ntake part in them.\" (Burbidge & Burbidge, 1996).\nNevertheless, the mechanism responsible for such uncommon processes was not identified at that time. Re-\n\nOdessa Astronomical Publications, vol. 20 (2007)\ncently, Goriely (2007) showed that nucleosynthesis of\nheavy (including radioactive) elements can occur in the\nstar's atmosphere due to the high-energy particles entering the atmosphere of the star. At the same time,\nthe origin of such particles was not clearly specified.\nThis idea was also discussed in Arnold et al. (2007).\nThe r-process has been frequently mentioned in\nrelation to the abundance anomalies observed in Ap\nstars (Cowley et al., 1973). In particular, Burbidge\n(1965) indicates the fact that the explosion remnants\nof a more massive star can be possible explanation of\nthe origin of the peculiarity. For instance, a supernova\nexplosion in the binary system and following contamination of its companion star with freshly synthesized\nmaterial could, in principle, explain the peculiarity,\nobserved in HD101065. The only problem is that\nin this case one has to suppose that such an event\nshould have happened not very long ago, since we are\nobserving now the signs of the short-lived isotopes in\natmosphere of this star.\n4. Possible origin of roAp stars HD101065\nand HR465\nIn order to explain several anomalous features of\nsome MCP stars, and especially their extremely peculiar chemical composition (an existence in atmosphere\nthe short-lived radioactive elements) we propose the\nfollowing hypothesis. Let us consider an example of\nHD101065 (Przybylski's star, PS), and assume that PS\nis a close binary system with a non-seen companion being the neutron star (NS). For this system an orbital\nplane is near perpendicular to the line of sight (Fig.\n1). The rapid wind, generated by NS, which consists\nof the electron-positron plasma, is accelerated almost\nto the speed of light and hit the PS atmosphere. The\nelectron-positron plasma falling on the PS must be ultrarelativistic, so that their kinetic energy E > me c2 .\nThe estimations show that the gamma-factor of the\n\"fast\" electrons/positrons, which is necessary for starting the photonuclear reactions, must exceed 20. This\nestimation is completely realistic, since gamma-factors\nof the electron-positron plasma in the upper magnetosphere of a radio pulsar can be within 10-10000 (Ruderman & Sutherland, 1975). In the spectrum of one of\nthe most studied pulsar PSR B0531+21 (Crab Nebula\npulsar) there really exist the gamma quanta within the\nrequired range of energies (Fig. 2).\nThe high-energy electrons from electron-positron\nplasma can also generate free neutrons via the direct\ninteraction with hydrogen nuclei in the PS atmosphere\n(p + e\u2212 \u2192 n + \u03bd). Such free neutrons are necessary for\nthe r-process to occur in the considered medium.\nThus, the nuclei of heavy elements (including the\nradioactive isotopes) in the PS atmosphere can be synthesized as a result of two processes: the photonuclear\n\n\fOdessa Astronomical Publications, vol. 20 (2007)\n\n3\n\nreaction and neutron capture by the seed nuclei of the\nlighter element. In both cases the source of the energetic particles, that trigger the nuclear reactions in\nthe PS atmosphere, is associated with the NS magnetosphere.\nLet us show why the binary system PS-NS must be\nthe close one. At present there exist a large uncertainty\nin the mass estimations of the PS. Thus, if we take\none extreme estimate of its effective temperature as\n6600\u25e6 K, and consider another one (spectral class B5, Figure 1: Geometry of the binary system containing\nPerryman et al., 1997), then from the spectral class- Przybylsky's star and neutron star.\nluminosity relation we obtain that mass of this star\nfalls in the range MP S \u2248 1.5 \u2212 8 * M\u2299 . For the further\nestimates we assume that masses of the PS and NS\nare MP S = (1.5 \u2212 8)M\u2299 and MN S = (0.7 \u2212 1.4)M\u2299\nrespectively.\nIt is possible to estimate the parabolic velocity for\nthis\nq system from the main integral of energy: VP AR =\n2G(MP S +MN S )\nR\n\n(were R is the distance from the center of mass to the NS). Taking into account that\nthe range of characteristic tangential velocities for the\nknown radio-pulsars is VP SRs \u2208 {100 \u2212 500} km/s,\nand the fact that these velocities must not exceed the\nparabolic velocity of the considered system, we obtain\nthe range of the most probable parameters (distance,\nthe center of mass of the PS-NS system, the orbital period, the corresponding masses of components). This\nrange is show in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the distances, estimated in that way, ranges from 0.035 AU\nfor a minimum mass MP S to 1.0 AU (for maximum\nmass). Knowing the parallax of PS \u03c0 \u2248 7.95 \u00b1 1.07\nmas (Perryman et al., 1997), one can estimate its distance (D = 125.8 \u00b1 15.7) pc and angular size (0.17 mas\nfor minimum mass and 14 mas for maximum mass).\nWith parameters listed above, the orbital period of\nPS ranges from 261 days up to 0.7 days. Note that\nHR465, which has invisible companion (but orbital\nplane is parallel to the line of sight) has rotation period of 273 days (Scholz, 1978; Fig. 4). At the same\ntime, the spectroscopic, photometrical data and magnetic field measurements could be well represented with\na period of 22-23 years (Fuhrhmann, 1989).\nSuch a long-term variation can be caused by some\nactive region on the stellar surface that changes its\nposition because of the weak precession. In 1996 the\nmagnetic field of this star was 5000 Gs, and the lines\nof CrII were extremely strong. In 2004 the strong\nlines of lanthanides and actinides (ThIII, UIII) were\nseen in the visible part of spectra (Gopka et al.,\n2007). Magnetic field at that time was 1300-1500 Gs\n(the estimate of Shavrina). Chromium abundance\nchanged by about 0.7 dex during the period of 8 years.\nWithin our model (MCP star + NS) active region (i.e.\nlocal increase of the temperature, in particular) can\nbe formed on the surface of MCP stars as a result\nof a localized interaction of atmosphere gas with\n\nFigure 2: Spectrum of the Crab pulsar.\nrelativistic plasma ejected by NS. To estimate the\nlocal temperature increase one can use the value of\nkinematic losses for known pulsars (Fig. 5) Resulting\nvalue is close to 3000\u25e6- 6000\u25e6 K. The short-term light\nvariation (roAp phenomenon) can be also explained\nby such kind of interactions.\n5. Conclusions\nThe proposed hypothesis, which consists in the\nsupposition that some MCP stars can be the binary\nstellar systems containing as a secondary component\nneutron star, can be capable in natural explaining of\nsome peculiarities associated with these stars. Among\nthem: anomalous chemical composition, an existence\nof the short-lived radioactive isotopes, short-time and\nlong-period variations of the light and magnetic field,\nX-ray and radio-emission detected for some MCP stars.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank V.V.
