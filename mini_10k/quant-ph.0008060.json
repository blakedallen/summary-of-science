What's good and bad about consistent histories\nThe basic problem faced by any extension of quantum theory outside the laboratory realm of Bohr's interpretation can be expressed by the slogan (Giulini et al., 1996) \"how does the classical world emerge?\"\nUnpacking the meaning of \"classical world\" we can extract several interlinked problems:\n1. How is it that the logic of propositions about macroscopic objects is classical (that is, a Boolean\nlattice) whereas the logic of quantum propositions is an orthocomplemented lattice (Beltrametti &\nCassinelli, 1981)?\n2. Where the classical behaviour is, as a consequence of underlying quantum processes, indeterministic,\nthen\n(a) what determines the particular Boolean sub-lattice of quantum states that can be expressed as corresponding classical states (why does the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat Gedankenexperiment have the result that we believe it would have)?\n(b) how is the statistical mechanics of these probabilistically chosen classical states derived\nfrom the dynamics of quantum theory?\n(c) on each individual occurrence, what determines which one of the classically allowed states\nis in fact actualised?\n3. When the classical behaviour is (at least to a high accuracy) deterministic, how is the classical\ndynamics derived from the quantum dynamics?\nI would claim that, apart from Bohm's interpretation, which relies on intrinsically unobservable hidden\nvariables, and interpretations involving essentially new and untested physics, existing interpretations can\n1\n\n\fsolve 2b and 3 in many situations, but can only partially solve the others. The consistent histories approach\n(Omn\u00e8s, 1999a; Giulini et al., 1996) has proceeded futhest with resolving these problems, and has done so in\na way that introduces the minimum of controversional ontological scafolding (many worlds etc). I want to\npropose a modification of the histories approach that solves 1 and 2a more satisfactorily. 2c remains a problem\nfor me, and for versions of the histories approach other than that of (Omn\u00e8s, 1999b), who deconstructs the\nquestion on metaphysical grounds.\nAttempts to solve 1 and 2a rest (as does 2b) on the phenomenon of decoherence which ensures that a\nstatistical ensemble of macroscopic systems linked to microscopic states, all initially prepared in the same\nstate, will as a result of environmental influences, evolve to an ensemble described by a density matrix that\nis almost exactly diagonal in a basis (the pointer basis, Zurek, 1981; Giulini et al., 1996) adapted to the\ndistinct classical states of the macroscopic system. This leaves two unresolved difficulties, however, which I\nwill justify shortly:\nA. The consistency condition used by the histories programme (see (2) below) in fact implies, tautologously without any physics, that the histories obey classical logic (in the sense of satisfying\nprobability sum rules: see Dowker and Kent (1996) eqn (2.5)). Thus 1 is not being solved by a\nphysical explanation, but is in effect just being put in \"by hand.\"\nB. Even if we accept the consistency condition, which forces a Boolean lattice, how do we know that\nthere is not some other Boolean lattice, in addition to that defined by macroscopically distinguishable states, which still satisfies the consistency condition? If that were the case, then the consistency\ncondition would not determine the lattice of classical states and 2a would not be solved.\nBoth these problems are of physical interest; for, if we could clearly articulate physical conditions under which\na unique Boolean lattice emerged in the quantum limit, then it would become of great interest, and would\nbe theoretically grounded, to look for areas where there were slight departures from a Boolean lattice. Some\naspects of biology might provide evidence of such areas (Ho, 1998). Point B rests (i) on the circumstances\nthat no rigorous mathematical proof exists of the uniqueness of the pointer basis in generating a classical\nlogic, and (ii) on the demonstration by Dowker and Kent (1996) that, both in specific examples and in\ngeneral on dimension-counting grounds, this basis is not unique. The latter argument is not cast-iron, since\nit could be that special symmetries invalidate the general dimension-counting arguments; but the onus is\nnow on those who claim uniqueness of the pointer basis to demonstrate it rigorously. Point A, however,\nprovides the main focus of this paper\n2. Consistent histories and the stability condition\nThe consistent histories formalism\nI assume here that we are dealing with conventional quantum mechanics over a given Hilbert space H. The\nversion of the histories formalism that I am using here is taken from Dowker and Kent (1996) except that\nmy notation interchanges their sub- and superscripts. This version is not explicitly relativistic, but I do not\nregard this as essential for the point being made here.\nA history set is a pair H = (\u03c1, (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3n )) for some n where\n\u03c1 is a density matrix (unit trace non-negative Hermitean operator on H)\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nfor each i, \u03c3i = (P1 , . . . , Pki ) with the Pj\noperators) satisfying\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nPj Pk = \u03b4jk Pj\n\n2\n\nbeing projections (interpreted as Heisenberg picture\n\n\fPki\n\nj=1\n\n(i)\n\nPj\n\n=1\n\nNote that through these conditions we are putting in by hand the classicality of the propositions for any one\ninstant, but we are not demanding it overall in the way that the different \u03c3i relate to each other.\nA history belonging to H is a sequence H = (P1 , . . . , Pn ) with Pi \u2208 \u03c3i for all i and the probability of H in\nthe initial state \u03c1 is given by\nP(\u03c1; H) := Tr(Pn . . . P1 \u03c1P1 . . . Pn ).\n(1)\nThe consistency condition on H in its strongest form (the arguments given above also apply to many of the\nweaker forms) is that\n(n)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(n)\n\n(1)\n\n(n)\n\nTr(Pin . . . Pi1 \u03c1Pj1 . . . Pjn ) = \u03b4i1 j1 . . . \u03b4in jn P(\u03c1; (Pi1 , . . . Pjn )).\n\n(2)\n\nThe stability condition\nThis condition is based on the well known distinction (see, for example, the survey in Tegmark, 2000)\nbetween the dynamical timescale td and the decoherence timescale tdc for a system. The dynamical time\nscale is determined by the system Hamiltonian, independently of the environment; whereas both are involved\nin decoherence. Dynamical timescales can vary widely: for human experience, based on neuronal firing rates,\nthis might be 10\u22123 s, for cosmology in the present era 1015 s and for electon-positron pair production (where the\nlogic would be highly non-classical) 10\u221220 s. The principle of the stability condition is that the probabilities\nfor histories should not vary (as a function of the timing of their propositions) on a timescale (the stability\ntimescale) that is very much less than the dynamical timescale td . We cannot, for instance, claim to be\ntalking about human experience and then introduce a proposition whose probability changes on a timescale\nof 10\u221210 s. It is straight forward (see \u00a73 below) to see that the probabilities for \"unphysical\" propositions\n(referring, for example, to superposed states of the human brain) vary on the decoherence timescale, and so\nthis condition does precisely what is required.\nThis proposal still has an air of the ad hoc about it, and needs to be related to a more fundamental theory. But\nit is, unlike the consistency condition, non-trivial (in the sense of point A, that it does not beg the question\nit is trying to solve) and is sufficiently grounded physically to point the way to a correct fundamental theory.\nThe rest of the paper is devoted to spelling out in more detail how this operates in practice.\nWe consider a situation where we are examining the effect of a proposition P posed after a subhistory\nH (i) = (P1 , . . . , Pi ) with an initial state of \u03c1. Thus we are concerned with P(\u03c1; H (i) , P ). Now let Pt denote\nthe proposition obtained by evolving P for time t, namely\nPt := exp(iHt/h\u0304)P exp(\u2212iHt/h\u0304).\n\n(3)\n\nThen we define the repetition probability by\np(t) := P(\u03c1; H (i) , P, Pt ).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that p(0) > p(t) for t > 0.\nWe can now define the (repetition) stability timescale ts for P in this context. The idea is elementary but\nits formulation rather tedious; again, an indication that the theory cannot be in any sense fundamental. We\nwant to define the stability timescale as the inverse of the gradient of p(t) near t = 0 (more precisely: the\nslope of the chord from t = 0 to a suitable point). Unfortunately, p(t) may be subject to small fluctuations\ndue to perturbations from background noise (of a normal physical kind unconnected with decoherence)\n3\n\n\fwhich could give rise to large gradients on a very small timescale. We define the magnitude of these possible\nfluctuations away from t = 0 by setting\nV (t, c) :=\n\nsup\nt\u2264t1 <t2 \u2264td\nt2 \u2212t1 \u2265c\n\n|p(t2 ) \u2212 p(t1 )|\nt2 \u2212 t1\n\nThen let F be the ratio of the slope of the chord from t = 0 to the slope of the following fluctuations:\np(0) \u2212 p(t) .\nV (t, t)\nF (t) :=\nt\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nhaving a supremum of F \u2217 , and let t\u2217 be the smallest point (it exists!) for which\nlim sup F (t) = F \u2217 .\n\n(7)\n\nt\u2192t\u2217\n\nThe stability timescale is then the inverse slope of the chord to t\u2217 :\nts :=\n\nt\u2217\n.\np(0) \u2212 p(t\u2217 )\n\n(8)\n\nThe stability condition is then the requirement on each \u03c3i that ts > \u03bbtd where \u03bb is some chosen small\nparameter.\n3. Stability and decoherence\nThis section fills in the obvious connection between stability and decoherence, showing that as a result of the\nlatter, the stabiity condition rules out superpositions of macroscopically distinct states, and thus gives rise to\na Boolean lattice. Decoherence involves the setting where H = HE \u2297 HS where S refers to the system and E\nto the environment. It is hard to give a completely general formulation of the results concerning decoherence\nand the pointer basis (see Giulini et al., 1996); but a model of the idea sufficient for our purposes might be\nthe proposition that each \u03c3i can be chosen so that\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(a) For all k, RangePk = HE \u2297 Vk\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nfor a subspace Vk\n\nof HS\n\n(i)\n\n(b) If |ei \u2208 Vk and |f i \u2208 Vl for k 6= l, then he|\u03c1S |f i \u2192 0 in the decoherence timescale, where \u03c1S is\nthe density matrix projected to HS by tracing over environment variables.\nConsider, then, the possibility of measuring a projection on a superposition |ki = a|ei + b|f i (i.e. a \"live\ncat + dead cat\" situation) with |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. Thus let P = |kihk|. Let \u03c1\u2032 = H (i)T \u03c1H (i) where T denotes\ntranspose. Then from (4)\np(t) = TrPt P \u03c1\u2032 P Pt .\n(9)\nThe effective density matrix following P , projected onto the system variables, is\n\u0012 \u2032 \u0013\nP\u03c1 P\n\u2217\n.\n\u03c1 :=\np(0) S\n\n(10)\n\nThis is a unit trace matrix proportional to |kihk|, and hence is equal to |kihk| ( = P ), the non-zero terms,\nin a basis containing |ei and |f i being\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\n|a|\nab\u0304\n\u03c1\u2217 \u223c\n.\n(11)\n\u0101b |b|2\nThe off-diagonal terms decay with the decoherence time tdc , while the diagonal terms are stable and so from\n(9) and (10), noting that tracing over the environment commutes with P (but not with H)\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\u0014 \u0015\n|a|\n\u01eb\n\u0101\np(t) = p(0)[ a b ]\n(12)\n\u01eb\n|b|2\nb\u0304\n4\n\n\fwhere |\u01eb| \u223c e\u2212t/tdc . Thus\np(t) \u2192 p(0)(|a|4 + |b|4 ) = p(0)(1 \u2212 2|a|2 |b|2 ).\nThis will violate the stability condition unless either |a| or |b| is very small, that is, unless the superposition\nis very close to a pure macroscopic state, as required.\n4. Conclusion\nI have stressed that this is a provisional theory with ad hoc elements. There seems to be a growing feeling\namong some workers (e.g. Zeh, 2000) that the inadequacies of the current situation can only be overcome by a\ntheory of mind; a view that I would endorse, though without thereby endorsing a many-minds metaphysics.\nThere remains, however, a considerable gap between approaches to a theory of mind starting from the\nrequirements of quantum theory (e.g. Donald, 1995) and those starting from psychology (e.g. Velmans,\n2000). Work under way to bridge this gap (e.g. Clarke, 2000) still needs to develop an adequate dynamics;\nbut the requirement of a stability condition can now be used to provide a clear goal in this work.\nReferences\nBeltrametti, Enrico G & Cassinelli, Gianni (1981) The Logic of Quantum Mechanics, Addison Wesley,\nReading, Mass.\nClarke, C J S (2000) \"Consciousness and non-hierarchical physics\" in The physical nature of consciousness,\nEd.
