However, simple population oscillations, induced by a resonant driving\npulse have received negligible attention as a prospective population manipulation method. This might be attributed\nto two reasons. The first is that Rabi theory is based on the rotating wave approximation (RWA), and all attempts\nto generalize it without RWA (e.g. [6, 7, 8]) are mathematically very involved. The second is that no attempt has\nbeen made to analytically generalize the original Rabi theory beyond the two-level systems.\nIn this paper an analytic extension of Rabi theory to transitions in many-level systems is presented. The aim is to\n'design' a driving pulse of the form:\nF (t) = F0 m(t) cos (\u03c9(t) t)\n\n(1)\n\nby establishing analytical optimization relations between its parameters: maximum pulse amplitude F0 , pulse envelope\nshape m(t), and time dependent carrier frequency \u03c9(t). The goal of this enterprize is twofold: the first is to achieve\nas complete as possible transfer of population between two selected states of the system; the second is to make this\ntransfer as rapid as possible. These two requirements, however, are conflicting: population transfer can be accelerated\nby using a more intense drive, but at the same time a stronger drive increases involvement of remaining system levels\nin population dynamics hence deteriorating population transfer between a selected pair of levels.\nIn the previous paper on this topic [9] it was shown how, for a pulse of arbitrary shape and duration, the drive\nfrequency can be analytically optimized to maximize the amplitude of the population oscillations between the selected\ntwo levels in a general many level quantum system. It was shown how the standard Rabi theory can be extended\nbeyond the simple two-level systems. Now, in order to achieve the quickest and as complete as possible population\ntransfer between two pre-selected levels, driving pulse should be tailored so that it produces only a single halfoscillation of the population. In this paper, this second (and final) step towards the controlled population transfer\nusing modified (i.e. many level system) Rabi oscillations is discussed. The results presented herein can be regarded\nas an extension of the standard \u03c0-pulse theory (see e.g. [10]) - also strictly valid only in the two level systems - to the\ncoherently driven population oscillations in general many level systems.\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL ANALYSIS\n\nAll the calculations in this section are done in a system of units in which ~ = 1.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: duje@znanost.org\n\n\f2\nA.\n\nCalculation setup\n\nA quantum system with N discrete stationary levels with energies Ei (i = 1, ..., N ) is considered. The system is\ndriven by a time dependent perturbation given in Eq. (1). In the interaction picture, the dynamics of the system\nobeys the Schroedinger equation:\nd\na(t) = \u2212iV\u0302(t)a(t),\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a(t) is a vector of time-dependent expansion coefficients a1 (t), ..., aN (t). The N\u00d7N Matrix V\u0302(t) describes\ninteraction between the system and perturbation. Explicitly, its elements are given by:\nVij (t) \u2261\n\nF0 \u03bcij\nm(t)(eisij (\u03c9(t)\u2212\u03c9ij )t + e\u2212isij (\u03c9(t)+\u03c9ij ) t ).\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\u03bcij is transition moment between the i-th and the j-th levels induced by the perturbation. sij \u2261 sign(Ei \u2212 Ej ) and\n\u03c9ij \u2261 |Ei \u2212 Ej | are respectively the sign and the magnitude of the resonant frequency for the transition between the\ni-th and the j-th level.\nThe aim is to induce population transfer between two arbitrarily selected levels, designated by \u03b1 and \u03b2, directly\ncoupled by the perturbation (i.e. such that \u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 6= 0). To simplify equations, the time variable t is re-scaled to \u03c4 , with\ntransformation between the two given by:\nd\u03c4 \u2261\n\nF0 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\nm(t)dt.\n2\n\n(4)\n\nThen with following substitutions:\n2\n(\u03c9(t) \u2212 \u03c9ij )\nF0 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\n2\n(\u03c9(t) + \u03c9ij )\ngij (\u03c4 ) \u2261 sij\nF0 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\nF0 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\nx(\u03c4 ) \u2261\nt(\u03c4 )\n2\n\u03bcij\nRij \u2261\n\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\n\nfij (\u03c4 ) \u2261 sij\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nEq.

The other selected level, as well as all the remaining\nN-2 'perturbing' levels of the system are unpopulated at this time.\nPopulation evolution \u03a0i (t) of the i-th level is determined from \u03a0i (t) = |ai (t)|2 .\nB.\n\nRabi-like population transfer in a three level system\n\nIt was demonstrated in the previous paper on this topic [9] that the analytical extension of the Rabi oscillations\ntheory beyond two-level systems is anchored in the analysis of the simplest of the 'many-level' systems - a three level\none. Hence, in this section the impact of the single additional level on the population transfer period is discussed:\nbeyond the 'selected' levels \u03b1 and \u03b2, the system now contains one additional 'perturbing' level, designated with index\np. The only requirements on the system internal structure are that \u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 , \u03bc\u03b2p 6= 0 and \u03bc\u03b1p = 0. While the first two\nrequirements are necessary, the last one does not reduce the generality of the final results to any significant extent\nand is introduced for calculational convenience exclusively.\n\n\f3\nFor the observed three-level system, the dynamical equation (9) reduces to:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nd \uf8f0a\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\uf8fb\na\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) =\nd\u03c4 a (\u03c4 )\np\n\n(11)\n\n\uf8f9\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0\neif\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c4 )x(\u03c4 ) + e\u2212ig\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c4 )x(\u03c4 )\n0\na\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\n\u2212 i \uf8f0e\u2212if\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c4 )x(\u03c4 ) + eig\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c4 )x(\u03c4 )\n0\nR\u03b2p (e\u2212if\u03b2p (\u03c4 )x(\u03c4 ) + eig\u03b2p (\u03c4 )x(\u03c4 ))\uf8fb \uf8f0a\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\uf8fb\nif\u03b2p (\u03c4 )x(\u03c4 )\n\u2212ig\u03b2p (\u03c4 )x(\u03c4 )\nap (\u03c4 )\n0\nR\u03b2p (e\n+e\n)\n0\n\uf8ee\n\n1.\n\nRecapitulation: minimizing the impact of the perturbing level\n\nAs it was shown in [9], Eq. (11), when the driving frequency is near the resonant value for the transition \u03b1 \u2194 \u03b2,\nthe following expression can be obtained for the population dynamics of level p:\n\u0010\nm(t(\u03c4 )) \u0011 if\u03b2p (\u03c4 )x(\u03c4 )\nap (\u03c4 ) \u2248 \u2212a\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) \u03c3\u03b2p\ne\n1 \u2212 \u2206\u03b2p (\u03c4 )\n\n(12)\n\nwhere\nF0 \u03bc\u03b2p\n2(\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b2p )\n\u03c9(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2\n.\n\u2206\u03b2p (\u03c4 ) \u2261\n\u03c9\u03b2p \u2212 \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03c3\u03b2p \u2261\n\n(13)\n\nPut in words, with the conditions mentioned, the dynamics of the level p parametrically depends on the dynamics\nof the level \u03b2 to which it is coupled. The relation between the amplitudes of the population oscillations for levels p\nand \u03b2 follows directly from the above expression:\n\u03a0p \u2248 \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 )\u03a0\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\n\n(14)\n\n\u0010\nm(t(\u03c4 )) \u00112\n\u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 ) \u2261 \u03c3\u03b2p\n.\n1 \u2212 \u2206\u03b2p (\u03c4 )\n\n(15)\n\nwhere:\n\nNote that, as \u2206\u03b2p (\u03c4 ) is generally very small and |m(\u03c4 )| \u2264 1, that parameter \u03c3\u03b2p actually determines the effective\n2\nstrength of applied perturbation: if \u03c3\u03b2p\n<< 1, then dynamical impact of level p is negligible and perturbation may\n2\nbe considered weak; if \u03c3\u03b2p \u223c 1, perturbation is very strong.\nFurther, the requirement of the minimization of the dynamical impact of the perturbing level p on the transition\n\u03b1 \u2194 \u03b2 leads to the following equation for the optimized dynamics of the (\u03b1,\u03b2) subsystem:\n\u0015\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\nd b\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\n0 1 b\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\n(16)\n= \u2212i\n1 0 b\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\nd\u03c4 b\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\n\u0001\nwhere the two-level state vector b\u03b1 (\u03c4 ), b\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) is merely the unitary transformed vector of the subsystem (\u03b1,\u03b2):\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\na (\u03c4 )\nb\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\n= e\u2212i\u039b\u0302(\u03c4 ) \u03b1\na\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\nb\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\n\n(17)\n\nNote that the precise form of the real transformation matrix \u039b\u0302(\u03c4 ) is irrelevant here as it has no impact on the\npopulation dynamics.\n\n\f4\nThe optimization procedure produces the analytic expression for the chirp of the driving frequency, which in the\nlowest order of approximation (suitable for all but the most intensive perturbations) amounts:\n\n\u03c9(t) = \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 + (s\u03b2\u03b1 s\u03b2p )(\u03c9\u03b2p \u2212 \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 )\n\n1\n2\u03c9\u03b2p\n\u03c32\n\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03c9\u03b2p \u03b2p t\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u00012\nm(t\u2032 ) dt\u2032\n\n(18)\n\nand from the Eq (16) it is found that the time \u0398 required for a single population transfer between levels \u03b1 and \u03b2,\ndetermined from the fundamental relation of the \u03c0-pulse theory:\nZ\n\n\u0398\n\nd\u03c4 =\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n(19)\n\nequals (in units of \u03c4 ):\n\u0398=\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n(20)\n\nAs was shown in [9], the 'exact' numerical solution to the Eq. (11) indeed maximizes the population oscillations\nin the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 subsystem. However, as will be discussed below, the predicted value for the period of the population\noscillations (Eq. (20)) is somewhat smaller than the correct one, with the discrepancy increasing with the increasing\npopulation leak to the level p. In the following section this issue is resolved and the corrected analytical expression\nfor determination of the population transfer (or oscillation) period is obtained.\n2.\n\nPatching the population conservation of the total system\n\nTo start the following discussion, notice that the optimized solution for the population transfer between levels \u03b1\nand \u03b2 (described by the Eq. (16)) is unfortunately too good to be true. Namely, its serious drawback lays in the fact\nthat the leak of the population from the (\u03b1,\u03b2) subsystem into the perturbing level p goes by completely unnoticed!\nFormally, the root of the problem hides in the fact that the mathematical trick which enabled decoupling of the\nlevel p dynamics from the rest of the system (i.e. the step between Eq.(18) and Eq.(19) in [9]) destroys the unitarity\nof the full dynamical equation for the three level system, Eq.(11). The consequence is that the dynamical equation\nfor the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 subsystem, Eq.(16) itself claims to be unitary, keeping the population of that subsystem fully conserved.\nThis is clearly impossible, as level p does indeed capture some population - the exact amount given by Eq.(14).\nThis malfunction caused by the decoupling procedure unfortunately cannot be remedied within the decoupling\nprocedure itself - the patch has to be provided by an independent approach. To do this, the following argument is\nused: since it is the equation for the dynamics of level \u03b2 that changes due to the decoupling procedure and consequently\ncauses the breakdown of the population conservation, it is only the dynamical equation for the level \u03b2 that has to be\nmodified; then, as the dynamics of the level \u03b2 is governed by the elements in the lower row of the dynamical matrix\nin Eq.(16), a particular ansatz intervention precisely into these elements might help rectify the overall population\ndynamics of the whole three level system. Hence, the correction is sought in the following form:\n\u0015\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\nd b\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\nb\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\n0\n1\n= \u2212i\n\u03b6(\u03c4 ) i\u03be(\u03c4 ) b\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\nd\u03c4 b\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03b6[\u03c4 ] and \u03be[\u03c4 ] are real non-negative functions. Such an ansatz does not interfere with the phase-fitting\neffect of the driving frequency optimization and Eq. (18) - forged by the decoupling procedure - which maximizes\nthe population oscillations in the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 subsystem, is left unharmed. Instead, it merely enables phase-independent\nmodification of the amplitudes of \u03b1 and \u03b2 populations.\nExpressing requirement of population conservation in the total three-level system as:\nd|b\u03b1 (\u03c4 )|2 + d|b\u03b2 (\u03c4 )|2 + d|bp (\u03c4 )|2 = 0 ,\n\n(22)\n\nsplitting the phase and amplitude contributions of the three wave function projections on the three stationary\nstates:\n\n\f5\n\nb\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) \u2261 B\u03b1 (\u03c4 )ei\u03c6\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) ,\nb\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) \u2261 B\u03b2 (\u03c4 )ei\u03c6\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) ,\nbp (\u03c4 ) \u2261 Bp (\u03c4 )e\n\ni\u03c6p (\u03c4 )\n\n(23)\n\n,\n\nand using the known relation between the populations of levels \u03b2 and p, Eq.(14), the following result is obtained:\n1\nB\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) dB\u03b1 + (1 + \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 ))B\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) dB\u03b2 + B\u03b2 (\u03c4 )2 d\u01eb\u03b2p = 0 .\n2\n\n(24)\n\nNow the corrected equation for the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 subsystem, Eq.(21), can be used to eliminate dB\u03b1 and dB\u03b2 and introduce\n\u03b6[\u03c4 ] and \u03be[\u03c4 ] in their stead:\n\u0001\ndB\u03b1 = \u2212iB\u03b2 Im ei(\u03c6\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\u2212\u03c6\u03b1 (\u03c4 )) d\u03c4 ,\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0011\ndB\u03b2 = \u2212i \u03b6(\u03c4 ) B\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) Im e\u2212i(\u03c6\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\u2212\u03c6\u03b1 (\u03c4 )) + \u03be(\u03c4 ) B\u03b2 (\u03c4 )Im e\u2212i\u03c6\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 .\n\n(25)\n\nFinally, taking together Eq.(24) and Eq.(25) it is found that:\n\u0010\nB\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) \u03b6(\u03c4 ) \u2212\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u00011\u0011\n\u0001\nd\n1\nsin \u03c6\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c6\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) + B\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) \u03be(\u03c4 ) +\nln 1 + \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 ) 2 sin \u03c6\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) = 0.\n1 + \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 )\nd\u03c4\n\n(26)\n\nSince for population oscillations B\u03b2 and B\u03b1 are 180o out of phase, this condition can be satisfied only if:\n1\n,\n1 + \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 )\n\u00011\nd\n\u03be(\u03c4 ) = \u2212 ln 1 + \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 ) 2 .\nd\u03c4\n\n\u03b6(\u03c4 ) =\n\n3.\n\n(27)\n\nPopulation oscillation period modified\n\nHence, the correct dynamical equation for the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 subsystem which both maximizes the population oscillation\namplitudes of these two levels as well as properly conserves the overall population of the three-level (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 p) system\nis:\n\"\n#\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0\n1\nd b\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\nb\n(\u03c4\n)\n\u03b1\n1\n\u00012\n= \u2212i\n.\n1\nd\nb\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\nd\u03c4 b\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\n1+\u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 ) \u2212i d\u03c4 ln 1 + \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 )\n\n(28)\n\nA simple extension of this result to the general many-level system (in which level \u03b1 also has some perturbing levels\n- jointly designated by q - attached to it) yields the total corrected dynamical equation for such a system:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u00011\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nd\nln 1 + \u01eb\u03b1q (\u03c4 ) 2\n\u2212i d\u03c4\nd b\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\nb\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\n1+\u01eb\u03b1q (\u03c4 )\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n.\n= \u2212i\n\u00011\n1\nb\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\nd\nd\u03c4 b\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\n\u2212i d\u03c4\nln 1 + \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 ) 2\n1+\u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 )\n\n(29)\n\nNow to finalize the calculation of the corrected population transfer period the following procedure is administered.\nFirst, the time variable is transformed \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c6 according to:\nd\u03c4 = \u03ba(\u03c6)d\u03c6\n\n(30)\n\nThe goal of this variable transformation is to produce, in the new time variable \u03c6, the closed dynamical equations\nfor b\u03b1 (\u03c6) and b\u03b2 (\u03c6) describing the dynamics which is as close as possible to the simple harmonic oscillation. Second,\n\n\f6\nand to that end, the transformation Eq.(30) is introduced into Eq.(29), the resulting relation is differentiated with\nrespect to \u03c6 and all but the lowest order terms in the small parameters \u01eb\u03b1q (\u03c4 ) and \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 ) are kept.

For negligible damping (\u01eb\u03b1q (\u03c6), \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c6) << 1),\nthey reduce to the harmonic oscillator equations, in which case the population transfer time of \u03c0/2 is obtained in\nthe variable \u03c6. In the the original time coordinate, \u03c4 , the corrected time \u0398 required for a single population transfer\nbetween the levels \u03b1 and \u03b2 is then obtained from:\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u0398\n\n\u03c0\nd\u03c4\np\n=\n2\n(1 + \u01eb\u03b1q (\u03c4 ))(1 + \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 ))\n\n(34)\n\nNote the difference between this result, and the result in Eq. (19) obtained from the standard \u03c0-pulse theory: in\nthe lowest order approximation, the corrected population transfer time is shorter then the one obtained from Eq. (19)\nby an order of 12 (\u01eb\u03b1q (\u03c4 ) + \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 )).\nOn the other hand, taking into consideration the damping factor in the Eq.(33), approximating:\nd\nd\nln(1 + \u01eb\u03b1q,\u03b2p (\u03c6)) \u2248\n\u01eb\u03b1q,\u03b2p (\u03c6)\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c6\n\n(35)\n\nand using the damped oscillator theory [11](p.246), an increase in the damping (expressed as an increase in \u01eb\u03b1q (\u03c4 )\nd 2\nand \u01eb\u03b2p (\u03c4 )) leads to the an increase in the population time transfer by an order of 12 d\u03c4\n\u01eb\u03b1q,\u03b2p (\u03c4 ). As this correction\nis an order of magnitude smaller than the correction obtained from Eq.(34), it can be neglected for all practical\npurposes. Furthermore, the additional corrections to the transfer period due to the neglected higher order elements in\nthe Eq.(31) are of the same order of magnitude as this correction due to the first derivative component, and as they are\nimpossible to obtain analytically, the value of this whole second order correction for the case of strong perturbations\nis somewhat shaky. However, this is not an issue, as the whole optimization theory developed in [9] - and on whose\napplicability the results of the above analysis hinge - assumes rather modest perturbations, and is not even expected\nto work properly for the extreme values.\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\n\nIn this section, numerical simulations of system dynamics for unoptimized and fully optimized driving pulse of the\nform of Eq. (1) are presented and compared. Here, unoptimized driving pulse is the one with driving frequency equal\nto the pure resonant frequency between the two levels selected for population transfer (\u03c9(t) = \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 ) and with pulse\nduration T determined according to the standard \u03c0-pulse theory relation, Eq.(19). On the other hand, the parameters\nof the fully optimized pulse are determined from Eq.(18) and Eq.(34).\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 1: In all of the numerical examples the same pulse form was used - m(t) = sin(\u03a9t)2 , but with different values of maximum\nintensity parameter (F0 ) and different total pulse duration, T . The respective values are quoted in each particular example.\n\nIn all cases, a three-level system is considered, with the following\n\u03c9\u03b2\u03b1 = 0.017671 a.u., s\u03b2\u03b1 = 1, \u03bc\u03b2\u03b1 = 0.073 a.u.; \u03c9\u03b2p = 0.017611\nsystem parameters correspond to the three ro-vibrational levels of the\n\u03b1 \u2261 (v = 0, j = 2, m = 0), \u03b2 \u2261 (v = 1, j = 1, m = 0), p \u2261 (v = 2, j\nexamples is m(t) = sin(\u03a9t)2 as shown in Fig 1.\nA.\n\nsystem parameters (a.u. \u2261 atomic units):\na.u., s\u03b2p = \u22121, \u03bc\u03b2p = 0.098 a.u.. These\nHF molecule in the ground electronic state:\n= 2, m = 0). The pulse shape in all of the\n\nPopulation oscillations\n\nAs was demonstrated in [9], frequency optimization minimizes the impact of the perturbing levels on the amplitude\nof the population oscillations. In this subsection, the necessity of the inclusion of additional correction Eq.(34) for the\npopulation transfer time - alongside the correction for the driving frequency - will be demonstrated. Also, the validity\nand the limitations of the analytically obtained expression for this correction will be discussed.\n1.\n\nLegitimate perturbation\n\n2\nFig.2 presents the dynamics of the system subjected to the external drive of limiting intensity, \u03c3\u03b2p\n= 0.05, corre\u22124\nsponding to the F0 = 2.80534 \u2217 10 a.u.. It is just strong enough to noticeably (albeit not significantly) distort the\npure resonant oscillations, but at the same time weak enough so that the theory developed in [9] and further in this\npaper provides the full and precise quantitative corrections.\nPulse duration determined according to the standard \u03c0-pulse theory expression, Eq.(19) is T\u03c0 = 3077832a.u.,\nwhereas the optimized one, obtained from Eq.(34) is Topt = 3126029a.u.. The pulse is aimed at producing five\ncomplete population oscillations.\nThree cases of dynamics are presented: Fig. 2.a shows the unoptimized dynamics; Fig 2.b shows the 'semi-optimized'\ndynamics, with optimized driving frequency, but unoptimized population transfer period; finally, Fig. 2.c shows the\nfully optimized dynamics. Observe that in the unoptimized case, the population oscillations end somewhat short of the\ncomplete cycle, and the initially populated level never achieves complete depopulation. Optimizing only the driving\nfrequency does indeed maximize the population oscillations by inducing the complete depopulation of the initially\npopulated level during oscillations, but at the same time the final population oscillation stops even further from the\nfull cycle than in the unoptimized case. Finally, introducing the population transfer period correction alongside the\ndriving frequency correction yields the required result: complete cycle of maximized population oscillations.\n\n2.\n\nStrong perturbation\n\n2\nIncreasing the driving perturbation intensity to somewhat greater value, \u03c3\u03b2p\n= 0.25 (F0 = 6.11409 \u2217 10\u22124 a.u..),\nthe limitations of the analytical theory clearly emerge. This is shown in Fig. 3: Fig. 3.a - Fig. 3.c respectively show\nthe unoptimized, analytically optimized (according to Eq.(18) and Eq.(34)) and 'manually optimized' dynamics. The\ncorresponding pulse duration times, aimed at producing three complete population oscillations, are T\u03c0 = 847324 a.u.,\nTopt = 901075 a.u. and Tman = 884300 a.u..\nNotice that in the analytically optimized case, Fig. 3.b, the initially populated level still fully depopulates, which\nindicates that even for this rather strong perturbation, the frequency correction Eq.(18) still stands strong. However,\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 2: Significance of the total analytical correction (in driving frequency and total pulse duration) for the dynamics of a\nmildly disturbed system. In all plots, major oscillations are the populations of the two targeted levels (\u03b1 and \u03b2) whereas the\n2\nminor oscillations are the population of the perturbing level (p). For the value of perturbation strength parameter \u03c3\u03b2p\n= 0.05,\nthe loss of the final unoptimized population transfer amplitude amounts about 2%. Optimization reduces this loss to below\n0.05%. The difference between the pulse duration obtained from standard \u03c0-pulse theory and the optimized value is 1.6%.\nRight hand-side plots present the details from the left hand-side plots.\n\nthe corrected period, although closer to the correct value than in the unoptimized case, is still somewhat removed\nfrom the correct value. Unfortunately, this 'optimization error' cannot be remedied analytically. Remember that the\nanalytical result Eq.(34) is obtained using only the first order approximation (Eq.(31)) to the full dynamical equations\nEq.(29). With perturbation as strong as in this case, the dynamical impact of the neglected elements of that equation\nbegin to show. However, as shown in Fig. 3.c, the full cycle of oscillations can still be produced, but this additional\ncorrection to the pulse duration had to be found by hand, using the trial and error method.\nB.\n\nPopulation transfer\n\nThe two final examples demonstrate the application of the developed optimization theory to the most interesting\ndynamical case regarding the coherent control: that of the single population transfer between the two targeted levels\n\u03b1 and \u03b2. As the validity and the limitations of the whole theory were already explored in the previous two examples,\nthe following examples will only demonstrate the improvements to the population transfer that can be produced using\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 3: Limitations of the analytical optimization theory. Again, major oscillations are the population of the two targeted levels\nwhereas the minor oscillations are the population of the perturbing level. For the value of perturbation strength parameter\n2\nis now \u03c3\u03b2p\n= 0.25, which is just beyond the limiting value for the full applicability of the presented optimization procedure.\nAlthough the analytical correction improves the final population transfer from 92% to 97% (with pulse duration correction of\n6%), the theory presented in this paper cannot account for an additional 1.6% correction in the duration of the pulse that\nfurther increases the final population transfer to over 99.99%.\n\nthe above results.\n1.\n\nLegitimate perturbation\n\nAgain as in the previous section, the first example (Fig. 4) presents the dynamics of the system subjected to the\n2\nexternal drive of limiting intensity. In this case, the perturbation strength parameter amounts \u03c3\u03b2p\n= 0.1, corresponding\n\u22124\nto the F0 = 4.07606 \u2217 10 a.u.. Calculated population transfer times are T\u03c0 = 211831 a.u. and Topt = 218483 a.u..\nThe unoptimized (dotted line) and the optimized dynamics (solid line) are plotted on the same graph to facilitate\nthe comparison between the two. Only the dynamics of the two target levels is shown - the plot of the perturbing\nlevel's (p) dynamics is omitted for the sake of clarity of the overall graph. Although the loss of the population transfer\nin the unoptimized case is not great, it nevertheless is noticeable. On the other hand, introducing the corrections for\npulse frequency and pulse duration clearly improves the population transfer bringing it very close to 100%.\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 4: Applicability of the analytical optimization procedure to the maximization of the population transfer. Yet again, major\noscillations are the population of the two targeted levels whereas the minor oscillations are the population of the perturbing\n2\nlevel. For this limiting value of perturbation strength parameter of \u03c3\u03b2p\n= 0.10, the optimization almost completely eradicates\nthe loss of the population transfer due to the dynamical impact of the perturbing level, increasing the population transfer from\n96% to 99.7%. Optimized pulse lasts 3% longer than the one obtained from the standard \u03c0-pulse theory.\n\n2.\n\nExtreme perturbation\n\nThe final example - presented in Fig. 5. - is qualitative, rather than quantitative, but even as such it is quite\nindicative of the overall usefulness of the whole optimization theory. The perturbation is now extreme, with strength\n2\nparameter \u03c3\u03b2p\n= 1 corresponding to the F0 = 1.22282 \u2217 10\u22123 a.u.. Calculated population transfer times are T\u03c0 =\n70610 a.u. and Topt = 82816 a.u..\nAgain, the unoptimized and the optimized dynamics are plotted on the same graph. Although optimization now\nclearly does not lead to the complete population transfer, the improvement from the unoptimized dynamics is significant demonstrating that even for this perturbation intensity the developed optimization theory qualitatively works\nquite nicely.\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 5: Breakdown of the quantitative optimization, but qualitatively the theory is still applicable. Half way through the pulse,\nin the unoptimized case now the population of the perturbing level surpasses the population of the initially unpopulated level.\nIntroduction of the optimized driving frequency and pulse duration significantly - although not fully - rectifies the population\ntransfer from below 40% to almost 90%. Optimized pulse is now almost 20% longer then the one obtained from the ordinary\n\u03c0-pulse theory.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe aim of research that led to this paper was to explore the possibility of using 'old fashioned' and rather simple\nphenomenon of Rabi oscillations for the controlled manipulation of the population in general many level system. This\npaper rounds up the topic of analytical optimization of pulse parameters (frequency chirp and pulse duration), opened\nin the author's previous work ([9]) that would lead to maximizing the population transfer between two targeted levels\nof the system. The theory developed provides the exact quantitative predictions of to what extent the dynamical\nimpact of the remainder of the many level system (beyond the two levels selected for the population transfer) begins\nto interfere with the targeted population transfer. It also provides the closed (albeit recursive) analytical expressions\nfor the optimization of pulse parameters.\nAlthough the major correction to the population transfer is achieved by optimizing the driving pulse's frequency\nchirp (given in [9]), this paper provides the additional fine tuning by establishing similarly simple analytical expression\nfor the determination of the optimal pulse duration. It demonstrates that the standard formula of the \u03c0-pulse theory,\nEq. (19) begins to fail as the perturbation increases to and beyond the well defined limiting value. It also provides\nsome remedy to this failure.\n\n\f12\nThe whole theory presented in [9] and this paper deals with only single laser pulse driving one particular transition\nin the many level system. The further research currently under way considers the possibility of applying a number of\ndistinct but simultaneous optimized pulses to drive the population through the chain of transitions through the system,\nhence producing as clean as possible transfer between the two levels not coupled by the single photon transition. The\npreliminary results indicate that an analytical optimization formula can be developed even for such a case.\n\n[1] G.K.Paramonov, V.A.Savva, Resonance effects in molecule vibrational excitation by picosecond laser pulses, Phys.
