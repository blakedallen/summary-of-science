The column height displays a complex behavior: for a large\namplitude of the temperature cycles, the granular column settles continuously, experiencing a small\nsettling at each cycle; By contrast, for small-enough amplitude, the column exhibits a discontinuous\nand intermittent activity: successive collapses are separated by quiescent periods whose duration is\nexponentially distributed. We then discuss potential mechanisms which would account for both the\ncompaction and the transition at finite amplitude.\n\nLiterature canonically presents granular materials as a\nbunch of athermal particles [1, 2, 3]. Indeed, the energy\nnecessary for the grains to hop one over another (a few\ntenths of millimeter, for instance) is roughly 10 orders\nof magnitude higher than the ambient thermal agitation\nkB T . This is probably one of the reasons why the behavior of a granular assembly submitted to temperature fluctuations has received so few attentions. Nonetheless, uncontrolled thermal dilations of a granular pile have been\nreported to generate stress fluctuations large enough to\nhinder reproducible measurements of the stress field inside the pile [4, 5], and even suspected to be the driving\nfactor leading to large-scale \"static avalanches\" [6]. Indeed, the slow relaxation and compaction of a granular\nmaterial, which has been hitherto produced by the input\nof mechanical energy [7], can be induced by periodically\nraising and then lowering the temperature of the granular assembly, as recently brought to the fore by Chen\nand co-workers [8]. However, the compaction dynamics\nas well as the basic mechanisms at stake remain unknown.\nIn this letter, we address the following questions: What\nis the dynamic of the top of a granular column submitted to thermal cycling? Does this compaction process\nexhibit features analogous to aging, as other compaction\nprocesses (tapping, cyclic shear...) do? And finally, what\nis the behaviour of the grain assembly in the limit of low\namplitude temperature-cycles, i.e. well below a cycling\namplitude of 40\u25e6 C [8]?\n\nsuch as glasses. First, the spectrum of density fluctuations was found to be strongly non-Lorentzian [10], which\nis a signature of multiple timescales in the system. Also,\nthe response of the column to an abrupt change in shaking intensity is analogous to aging in glasses [11, 12]. Finally, in the limit of small-intensity vibrations, the relaxation rate becomes so slow that the system cannot reach\nthe steady-state density within the experiment timescale.\nAt the microscopic scale, a grain exhibits random motion\nwithin confined volumes or cages, occasionally a longer\nexploration corresponding to a change of cage, and rarely\njumps, during which it moves \"significantly\" [13]. Cyclic\nshear deformations of a granular assembly also lead to\ncompaction and present the transient cage effects reminding one of colloidal glasses [3, 14]. Those experimental\nresults have motivated numerous theoretical and numerical works, a review of which can be found in [7].\n\nVideo camera\n\n1 mm\n\nHeating cables\n\nCompaction of granular materials has been thoroughly\nstudied over the past 20 years both experimentally and\ntheoretically [7]. It has been achieved by direct input of\nmechanical energy. By far, the most-used device consists\nof a vertical column which is periodically shaken with a\ncontrolled vibration intensity. Under vibration, a lowdensity granular-pile compacts towards a steady state\nwith a final density that depends on the intensity of the\nvibrations [1, 2]. Nonetheless, those final states have been\nshown not to depend on the initial conditions (packing\nfraction) and even to be genuine thermodynamic states\n[9]. In addition to their general interest [7], vibrated\ngranular materials have been found to exhibit deep common physical features with out-of-equilibrium systems,\n\nMultimeter\n\nPt 100 sensor\n\nH\n\nPC\n\nGranular matter\nNitrogen flow\n\nFIG. 1: Sketch of the experimental setup. Inset: picture of the upper part of the column. The granular level is\nindicated by the white dotted-line.\n\nUp to now, the heating of a granular pile has only been\nused to develop dynamic light-scattering experiments [15]\nor to probe numerically its impact on the force network\n[16]. Here, we report the time-resolved compaction dynamics of a granular column submitted to a large number\nof temperature cycles and shed new lights on the key ingredients governing this process.\n\n\f2\n0\n-2\n\n10 \u03bcm\n\n-4\nhn (mm)\n\nExperimental set-up - The experimental set-up (Fig. 1)\nconsists in a vertical glass tube (height 1.7 m, inner diameter 13 mm) firmly fastened to a wall into the basement\nof the physics department, in order to flee mechanical vibrations. The sample consists of a column (height H) of\nspherical glass beads (diameter d) poured into the tube.\nAn additional gas-input, at the bottom of the column,\nmakes it possible to loosen the pile thanks to an upward\nflow of dry nitrogen. The temperature cycles are imposed by means of a heating cable (Prolabo, 40 W/m)\ndirectly taped on the outer surface of the tube wall. The\nresulting temperature is measured by means of a sensor (Pt100, located close to the free surface of the granular material) and a multimeter (Keithley Intruments,\nModel 196). The free surface of the material, which is\nilluminated by a red LED (Kingbright, L-793SRC-E, located inside the tube, above the granular material) is\nimaged from the side with a video camera (Panasonic,\nWV-BP500) connected to a frame grabber board (Data\nTranslation, DT2255). A macro, running under a dataprocessing software (WaveMetrics, IGOR Pro 4.0), makes\nit possible to drive the heating power, to record the resulting variations of the temperature and to measure accurately the height H from the images: A subpixel resolution (namely, less than a tenth of a pixel which typically\nstands for 5 \u03bcm) is achieved by considering the average\nposition of the free surface, assumed to correspond to the\ninflection point in the vertical intensity-profile averaged\nover the whole diameter of the tube. Measurements are\nperformed 20 times per temperature cycle.\nDue to long experimental times, we limit our report to\na given diameter d = 510\u00b190 \u03bcm of the grains (Matrasur\nCorp.) and to a given period 2\u03c0/\u03c9 = 600 s of the cycles. The cycling period, 10 minutes, is arbitrarily chosen\nto be small enough to avoid excessively-long experimental times but large enough to insure\np that the associated\nthermal penetration-length lp \u2261 2\u03bb/(\u03c1 C\u03c9) \u2243 6 mm\nis about the tube radius (\u03bb \u2243 0.2 W m\u22121 K\u22121 and\nC \u2243 106 J m\u22123 K\u22121 respectively denote the thermal\nconductivity and heat capacity of a typical glass-grains\npile [17].) It is here crucial to note that the column is\nheated homogeneously along its whole length but that\nthe temperature is likely to vary in the radial direction.\nPrior to each experiment, the granular column is prepared in a low-density state thanks to the dry-nitrogen\nupward flow. The top of the column is then higher than\nthe field imaged by the camera (typically 1 cm above)\nand we set the amplitude of the cycles, \u2206T , to the largest\naccessible value, \u2206T = 27.1\u25e6 C. The preparation of the\nsample ends when the top of the column enters the observation field. At this point, the granular column is\n\"quenched\": The amplitude of the cycles is set to the\nchosen value \u2206T lying bewteen 0 and 27.1\u25e6 C, which defines the origin of time t = 0. The granular column is\nsubsequently submitted to at least 1000 cycles (7 days).\nFirst experimental observations - Under the action of\n\nAn\n\n-6\n\u03b4n\n\n-8\n-10\n-12\n-14\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nn\nFIG. 2: Height variation hn vs. number of cycles n.\nOne observes first an exponential behavior at short time followed by a subsequent logarithmic creep at long time (The\nblack curve corresponds to the test function htn defined in the\ntext.) Inset: Oscillations of the column height associated with\nthe temperature cycles (An and \u03b4n are respectively defined to\nbe the amplitude of the increase and the drift of hn at the\ncycle n.) For the chosen \u2206T , the column settles slightly at\neach cycle (H = 140 cm, 2\u03c0/\u03c9 = 600 s and \u2206T = 10.8\u25e6 C.)\n\nthe temperature cycles the column height decreases: we\nreport the variation hn \u2261 H(2\u03c0n/\u03c9) \u2212 H(0), where n denotes the time in units of the cycle period or, equivalently\nwhen integer, the number of imposed cycles (Fig. 2). We\nobserve that the thermal-induced compaction is a very\nslow phenomenon: after 7 days (1000 cycles), the decrease of the height is of about 1.5 cm (about 1% of the\nheight H), which indicates that the system remains very\nfar from the maximum compaction (roughly a decrease\nof about 10% of the column height, i.e. hn \u223c 10 cm)\nwithin the experimental time. Accordingly, after the experiment, we checked that a single finger tap produces\na collapse of the granular height of one centimeter at a\nrough estimate. We also checked during 3 days that the\nheight H of the column stays constant when no temperature cycles are imposed, which proves that ambient mechanical vibrations and changes in the room temperature\nhave no (or little) effect in our experimental conditions.\nBefore we discuss the compaction dynamics, it is relevant to determine which part of the column is involved\nin the phenomenon. Our measurements are accurate\nenough for observing oscillations of H associated with\nthe temperature variations (Fig. 2, inset). We observe\non the raw data that the amplitude An , which is proportional to \u2206T , increases logarithmically with n (Fig. 3).\nThe oscillations of H are due to the thermal dilation of\nboth the tube and the granular material. In order to\nassess the contribution of the granular material, we first\ndetermine the amplitude, \u03b4ht (z), of the tube displacement in the laboratory frame as a function of the height\nz (origin at the bottom of the column) by marking its\n\n\f3\n1600\n\n70\n\n0.0\n\n60\nhn (mm)\n\n40\nnc\n\nAn (\u03bcm)\n\n-0.5\n\n1200\n\n50\n\n30\n\n800\n\n-1.0\n-1.5\n-2.0\n\n20\n400\n\n10\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nn\nFIG. 3: Amplitude An vs. number of cycles n. The data\nare successfully accounted for by An = \u2206T [a0 +b0 ln(n)] with\na0 \u2243 13.8 nm/K and b0 \u2243 2.5 nm/K (H = 140 cm, 2\u03c0/\u03c9 =\n600 s and, from bottom to top, \u2206T = 10.8, 16.2 and 27.1\u25e6 C.)\n\nouter wall. The amplitude \u03b4ht (z) is found to be linear in\nz and the slope provides us with an estimate of the linear\nthermal-expansion coefficient, \u03ba = (3.6\u00b10.4) \u00d710\u22126 K\u22121 ,\nof the tube material. Then, considering the relative variation of the inner volume, we write the relation between\nthe amplitude An and the relative variation, \u03b4Vg /Vg , of\nthe volume Vg of the granular material: An \u2212 \u03b4ht (0) =\nH(\u03b4Vg /Vg \u22122\u03ba\u2206T ). Experiments performed for different\nheight H demonstrate that An \u2212 \u03b4ht (0) is proportional\nto H, which shows that \u03b4Vg /Vg is independent of H. We\nthus infer that the whole height H of the granular column\nis involved in the observed oscillations of the free surface.\nCompaction dynamics - For a large \u2206T (typically more\nthan 3\u25e6 C), the column systematically compacts during\nthe decrease of the temperature, at each cycle, and the\namplitude \u03b4n of the collapses (defined in Fig. 2, inset)\ndecreases when n increases, which accounts for the overall behavior of H as a function of n. We show here\nthat the results obtained by Chen and co-workers for\n\u2206T > 40\u25e6 C [8] hold true at much smaller \u2206T . Besides,\nwe resolve the column dynamics and, this, over a significant longer duration. Here, the column height first\ndecreases exponentially to reach, after the characteristic number nc of cycles, a logarithmic behavior at long\ntime (Fig. 2). This response to the thermal quenching\nis very similar to the one the system exhibits to step\nstrain solicitation [18]. We estimated nc from the experimental data by interpolating hn with the test function\nhtn \u2261 h0 + he exp (\u2212n/nc ) + hl ln(n). In addition, we\nchecked that the shortest characteristic time obtained\nfrom the interpolation by a double exponential [19] is\nconsistent with nc and presents the same behavior as a\nfunction of \u2206T . We observe that nc drastically increases\nwhen \u2206T is decreased. Moreover, nc even seems to diverge at \u2206Tc (We get 2.8 < \u2206Tc < 4.0 \u25e6 C, Fig. 4), which\nprefigures a qualitatively-different dynamics of the col-\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n200 400 600 800 1000\nn\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n\u2206T (\u00b0C)\n\nFIG. 4: Characteristic number nc vs.\namplitude\n\u2206T . The characteristic number of cycles nc increases drastically when \u2206T is decreased and even seems to diverge for\n\u2206Tc \u2243 3\u25e6 C. Inset: For \u2206T < \u2206Tc , the column settles,\nby jumps, linearly with time. For readibility, we only display\ndata obtained during the first half of the experiment duration\n(14 days, H = 140 cm, 2\u03c0/\u03c9 = 600 s and \u2206T = 2.8\u25e6 C.)\n\numn compaction at a lower amplitude.\nFor \u2206T < \u2206Tc , one indeed observes that the column is\nnot flowing regularly anymore, but evolves by successive\ncollapses separated by rest periods (Fig. 4, inset). The\noverall compaction velocity is constant (steady regime)\nand it is therefore relevant to consider the probability\ndistribution P (\u2206n) of the number of cycles \u2206n between\ntwo successive collapses (Fig. 5). However, due to the\nsmall number of collapses, N = 175, within the experimental time (14 days), the behavior of P (\u2206n) is difficult\nto assess directly Rand we consider the cumulated prob\u221e\nability, F (\u2206n) \u2261 \u2206n P (x) dx, instead [20]. We obtain\nF (\u2206n) \u2243 exp (\u2212\u2206n/\u2206n\u2217 ) with \u2206n\u2217 \u2243 12 for \u2206T =\n2.8\u25e6 C (Fig. 5a). The delay \u2206n between two successive\ncollapses is thus observed to be exponentially distributed.\nBy contrast, the amplitude of the corresponding collapses, \u03b4n , exhibits a Gaussian probability-distribution\nQ(\u03b4) whose width is estimated to be \u03b4 \u2217 = 63 \u00b1 4 \u03bcm\n(Fig. 5b), roughly a tenth of the grain diameter. The\ncompaction of the material is thus shown to result from\ncollapses that are randomly distributed in time.\nDiscussion and conclusion - The mechanisms leading\nto the compaction could be either extrinsic (the dilation\nof the container at stake) or intrinsic (only due to the\ndilation of the grains.) Chen et al. suggested that the\ncompaction could be due to \"the difference between the\nthermal expansion of the container and of the grains\" [8],\nthus to an extrinsic mechanism. In our case, the beads\n(\u03bab = 9 \u00d7 10\u22126 K\u22121 ) and the container (\u03ba = 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22126\nK\u22121 ) are made of glass and present roughly the same\nthermal expansion coefficient [21]. Thus, we do not think\nthat the thermal dilation of the container is the primary\ncause of the compaction. This conclusion is supported\n\n\f4\n\nF (\u2206n)\n\n-1\n\n(a)\n\nQ (\u03b4) (\u03bcm )\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n(b)\n\n0.01\n6\n4\n2\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\u2206n\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150\n\u03b4 (\u03bcm)\n\nFIG. 5: Statistics below the transition. (a) : The cumulated probability F (\u2206n) \u2243 exp (\u2212\u2206n/\u2206n\u2217 ) is an exponential function of \u2206n and the characteristic number \u2206n\u2217 \u2243 12.\n(b) : The probability distribution Q(\u03b4) \u2243 exp [\u2212(\u03b4/\u03b4 \u2217 )2 ] is\na Gaussian function whose width \u03b4 \u2217 = 63 \u00b1 4 \u03bcm. The statistical data reported herein correspond to the 175 collapses\nobserved within the experimental time (14 days, H = 140 cm,\n2\u03c0/\u03c9 = 600 s and \u2206T = 2.8\u25e6 C).\n\nby preliminary results obtained by heating periodically\nthe granular column along its axis [22] and the recent\nsimulations by Vargas and McCarthy [16]. Dealing with\nan intrinsic mechanism, we guess that an overall temperature change would only produce a homogeneous dilation of the pile and no spatial reorganisation of the\ngrains. We thus propose the following scenario, compatible with previous results [8]: due to the radial thermalgradient of amplitude \u2206T /lp , the grains are subjected to\na periodic shear, \u03b3, along the vertical which induces local rearrangments and, accidentally, internal avalanches.\nThis mechanism is supported by the estimate of the shear\n\u03b3 = \u03bab (\u2206T /lp )L, where L is a characteristic size which\nranges from the grain- to the tube-diameter. We obtain,\nfor L \u2208 [0.510, 13] mm, that the relative displacement\nof two neighbor grains \u0393 \u2261 \u03b3d/\u2206T \u2208 [0.4, 10] nm/\u25e6 C\nwhereas, using an AFM, we estimated the maximum size\nof the asperities associated with the surface roughness\nof the beads, s \u2243 100 nm (Invoking the surface roughness is supported by numerical simulations: for perfectly\nsmooth grains the maximum compacity is reached after\na few cycles [16], which contrasts with our observations.)\nIn this framework, the continuous compaction would thus\ncorrespond to amplitudes \u2206T such as \u0393\u2206T > s, whereas\njumps would be observed for \u2206T < \u2206Tc \u2243 s/\u0393. From\nthe experimental \u2206Tc \u2243 3\u25e6 C, we could infer that the\ntypical length at stake, L, is about the tube radius and,\nthus, the transition a finite-size effect. Due to long experimental times, we limited our report to results which\nclearly demonstrate the efficiency of the techniques. The\ndependance of the critical amplitude \u2206Tc on the column\n\nheight and diameter as well as on the cycling frequency\nand grain roughness is necessary to corroborate or discard the proposed mechanism. In particular, the sensitivity to the frequency \u03c9 will indicate the role played by\nthe temperature gradient. We also plan to locate the origin of the collapses by listening to the associated noise\nand to observe the local displacement by optical means.\nThis way, we hope to correlate the macroscopic behavior\nto the local dynamics as already done for tapping [13, 23]\nand cycling shear experiments [3, 24].\nAcknowledgments We thank \u00c9ric Bertin, Sergio\nCiliberto, and Jorge Kurchan for fruitful discussions.\n\n[1] J.B.
