[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]). The situation is complicated\nin type-II superconductors because magnetic fields penetrate the sample in the form of Abrikosov vortices8,9\nwhose collective behavior determines the macroscopic\nelectromagnetic response. The interaction between vortices and local modulations of the superconducting properties leads to pinning, which together with thermal fluctuations results in spatio-temporal variations of the vortices (magnetic induction) and therefore the irreversible\nmagnetic properties. Strong thermal fluctuations and\nweak pinning lead to complex H \u2212 T diagrams with various crossovers in the static and dynamic electromagnetic\nresponse of vortex matter.\nIn the case of layered superconductors, such as the\nhigh-Tc cuprates and ET organics, a non-monotonic dependence in the field dependent magnetization is observed (see Refs. [10,11,12,13]). This is called the \"fishtail\" or peak-effect. The latter term is ambiguous since\na different nonmonotonic behavior, usually closer to the\nsecond critical field, is observed in low-Tc superconducting alloys1,14 . Examples of this can be found in materials such as NbSe2 15 and neutron-irradiated V3 Si16 and\nMgB2 .17 Another prominent feature of high-Tc superconductors is a very large rate of magnetic relaxation (giant\nflux creep, reported by Yeshurun and Malozemoff18 ) and\nits complicated time, magnetic field, and temperature\ndependence.5,6,7 While the mechanisms of the magnetic\nrelaxation and fishtail feature in the cuprates are still\nbeing discussed, several self-consistent microscopic numerical simulations and phenomenological models have\nbeen proposed. Some of these have been able to explain\nthe observed effects in many classes of unconventional\n\nsuperconductors. Magnetic relaxation with an emphasis on high-Tc superconductors is reviewed by Yeshurun,\nMalozemoff, and Shaulov.7 A detailed analysis of the pinning strength and the barriers for magnetic relaxation in\nthe case of weak collective pinning and creep is given by\nBlatter et al.5 and also by Brandt.6\nIn disordered granular and polycrystalline materials\nmuch of the response comes from extrinsic factors, such\nas granularity and significant disruption of supercurrent\nflow between the grains. To study intrinsic magnetic\nproperties that can be related to the mechanism of superconductivity, such as anisotropy and basic length scales\n(coherence length, \u03be, and London penetration depth, \u03bb),\none must turn to single crystals. A vast amount of literature on this subject clearly shows that different classes of\nsuperconductors exhibit unique static and dynamic magnetic responses. This allows us to discuss the similarities\nand differences in vortex behavior and to look for the\nconnections between different classes of materials. Vortex phase diagrams that show various transitions, such\nas changes in vortex lattice symmetry, dimensionality or\nmobility. Pinning strength and magnetic dynamics are\nparticularly useful for such comparisons and determining applications. Recent examples are CeCoIn5 19 and\nMgB2 .20\nSo far, only a limited amount of information regarding the vortex behavior in single crystals of Fe-based\npnictide superconductors is available. In polycrystalline\nsamples, the magnetic behavior is significantly affected\nby extrinsic factors, such as grain morphology, surface\nroughness, and inter-grain voids and interfaces. In these\nmaterials, it has been found that some of the grains are\nnot even superconducting21 . Although the superconducting granularity can be estimated from magneto optical\nimaging, and some important parameters can still be extracted22,23 , the polycrystalline structure does complicate the analysis. For example, a signature of nonmonotonic M (H) has been reported in polycrystalline wires of\nSmFeAsO0.8 F0.2 24 and could be related to the fishtail fea-\n\n\f2\nture of this work, but it could also be due to the physics\nof inhomogeneous multi-phase materials. Furthermore,\nsevere effects of inter-grain weak-links did not allow for\nquantitative analysis of the intrinsic properties.\nThe first measurements of magnetization and relaxation in individual single crystals of the oxypnictide superconductor NdFeAsO1\u2212x Fx have revealed the vortex\nphysics to be surprisingly reminiscent of cuprate superconductors, in particular the existence of a large magnetic relaxation rate and relatively weak pinning.21 Later\ntorque measurements on the similar Sm-based system\nhave lead to the conclusion that the electromagnetic\nanisotropy is large and quite temperature dependent.25\nMore recent high-field torque measurements on similar\ncrystals have shown a much smaller anisotropy.26 The superconducting crystals based on the parent RFeAsO compound (1111 system, where R is a rare earth element), are\nsmall and difficult to obtain (via high-pressure synthesis)\nand study. On the other hand, large crystals based on the\nrelated oxygen-free parent compound AFe2 As2 (122 system, where A is an alkaline element), can be grown in flux\nat ambient pressure (see, e.g., A=Ba27 , Sr28 and Ca29 ).\nBoth A and Fe sites can be doped to achieve superconductivity with holes or electrons as carriers, respectively.\nFor example, among other results, detailed thermodynamic measurements of the Ba1\u2212x Kx Fe2 As2 compound\nhave shown a very low anisotropy of the second critical\nfield, \u223c 327,30 . The work performed on superconducting\nBa(Fe1\u2212x Cox )As2 has shown that Co doping does not\nintroduce significant additional scattering31 . The fishtail\nmagnetization and weak anisotropy has also been studied.32 High-field properties33 as well as penetration depth\nstudies34 of single crystals of this compound will be reported elsewhere. It is this system that we chose for the\npresent study for its superior superconducting properties.\nIn this paper we use global and local magnetic properties as well as direct electro-transport measurements\nto study the details of vortex pinning and magnetic relaxation, evaluate supercurrent density, and finally construct the vortex phase diagram in single crystals of\nthe recently discovered Fe-based pnictide superconductor, Ba(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 .\nWe distinguish between the true critical current density, jc , which marks the crossover between flux flow\nand flux creep regimes, and the general supercurrent\ndensity, j \u2264 jc , which is observed in the experiment.\nBy definition of the critical current, at j = jc the\ncurrent-dependent barrier for vortex escape from the pinning potential U (j/jc ) = 0. The supercurrent is determined by the time-window of the experiment, \u2206t, and\ncan be estimated from the logarithmic solution35 of the\nflux creep equation, U (j/jc ) = T ln (1 + \u2206t/t0 ), where\nt0 \u223c 10\u22125 \u221210\u22127 s, is the macroscopic characteristic time\nthat depends on the sample size and shape as well as on\nthe microscopic attempt time, \u03c40 \u223c 10\u221210 \u221210\u221213 s.5,36,37\n(We use units where the energy barrier is measured in\nkelvin, so kB = 1.) It is actually the supercurrent that\ndetermines the usefulness of a particular superconductor\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Schematics used in calculations and\ndefinitions of the sample dimensions and flows of the supercurrents. (a) the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to\nthe ab\u2212 plane (parallel to the crystallographic c\u2212 axis and d\u2212\nedge). (b) the magnetic field is applied along the ab\u2212 plane\n(shown along the a\u2212 edge).\n\nfor current-carrying applications and therefore the magnetic irreversibility should be analyzed both in terms of\nmagnetic hysteresis and the rate of magnetic relaxation.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nSingle crystals of Ba(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 were grown out\nof FeAs flux using high temperature solution growth techniques. More specifically, the powders of FeAs and CoAs\nwere mixed with Ba in the ratio Ba:FeAs:CoAs=1:3.6:0.4.\nThe mixture was placed into an alumina crucible and a\nsecond catch crucible containing quartz wool was placed\non top of the growth crucible. Both were sealed in a\nquartz tube under argon and slowly heated to 1180 \u25e6 C,\nheld for 2 hours, and slowly cooled to 1000 \u25e6 C over a\nperiod of 36 hours. Once the furnace has reached 1000\n\u25e6\nC the FeAs is decanted from the single crystals using a\ncentrifuge. The size of the resulting crystals can be as\nlarge as 12 x 8 x 1 mm3 . Elemental analysis was performed using wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\nin the electron probe microanalyzer of a JEOL JXA8200 Superprobe. It showed the actual Co concentration\nis Co/(Co+Fe)=7.4%, so the more accurate formula is\nBa(Fe0.926 Co0.074 )2 As2 , but we round it to the second\ndigit in the text. During the course of this study several\nsamples from the same batch were measured. As shown\nbelow, they all have a transition temperature off Tc = 22\nK, as determined from dc magnetization (inset of Fig. 2)\nand from transport measurements, Fig. 7.\nFor the measurements of total magnetic moment\n(global magnetic measurement), a cuboid-shaped sample (see Fig. 3) of dimensions, 0.28 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 1.26 mm3 ,\nwas fixed in a gelatine capsule with a small amount of\n\n\f3\n0.10\n\nH || d-edge\n\nH || a-edge\n\n5 K\n\n5 K\n\n10 K\n\n10 K\n\n15 K\n\n0.02\n\n18 K\n\n0.05\n\n15 K\n\n0.00\n\n-0.05\n16 K\n15 K\n\n100\n\n-5\n\n-1x10\n\n22 K\n\n-5\n\n2a\n\nalong a\n\n0\n\nj\n\n-2x10\n\nalong d\n\n50\n\np\n\n0.00\n\n2b\n\n15 K\n\n-0.02\n\nH = 10 Oe\nM (emu)\n\nM (emu)\n\n-0.10\n\n17 K\n\n0\n\n0.00\n\n(kA/cm2)\n\n18 K\n\n0.02\n\nM (emu)\n\nM( emu)\n\n18 K\n\n-50\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.04\n\n19 K\n-5\n\n-3x10\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n5\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2d\n\n6\n\nH (T)\n\nT (K)\n\nH (T)\n\n-0.15\n\n-100\n\n6\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\nH (T)\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Magnetization loops measured in a\n0.28 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 1.26 mm3 single crystal of Ba(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2\nalong the crystallographic c\u2212 axis (along the d\u2212 edge) at\nT = 5, 10, 15 and 18 K.

To check for possible errors due to mechanical misalignment of the sample assembly, several\nkey measurements (such as M (H) loops) were repeated\nthree times each time after the sample was removed and\nre-assembled. No noticeable variation in the results was\nfound. The magnetization measurements were conducted\nin a Quantum Design MPMS magnetometer. The second\ncritical field, Hc2 (T ), estimated from the onset of superconductivity, was measured by using a tunnel-diode\nresonator technique.38\nSamples for transport measurements were cut with a\nrazor blade into long thin bars having typical dimensions\nof (2 \u2212 3) \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.02 mm3 . Contacts were made to the\nsamples by soldering silver wires with a silver-based alloy and had negligible resistance (less than 0.1% of the\nsample resistance). This allowed for both two and four\nprobe measurements to be taken. To sustain a high current density without thermal shock, samples were glued\nwith GE-varnish onto an insulating heat sink substrate\n(LakeShore Cryotronics Inc.). Current wires were thermally anchored to two silver foil heat sinks (see inset in\nFig. 5). Current-voltage characteristics, V(I), were measured in a Quantum Design PPMS in constant current\nmode.

In all images, the intensity is proportional to\nthe local value of the magnetic induction perpendicular\nto the sample surface.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA.\n\nSupercurrent density\n1.\n\nMagnetization\n\nLet us first define the geometry of the experiment.\nWe consider a cuboid-shaped crystal with dimensions\n2d < 2a < 2b, as shown schematically in Fig.1 and one\nof the actual samples, 0.28 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 1.26 mm3 , is shown in\nthe inset of Fig.3. In Ba(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 , the crystallographic ab\u2212 plane has the largest area and is parallel\nto the geometric ab\u2212 plane of a cuboid. The smallest\ndimension 2d is the sample thickness. When a magnetic\nfield is oriented along the crystallographic c\u2212 axis (along\nthe d\u2212 edge), the measured magnetic moment per unit\nvolume (volume magnetization) is denoted as Md . Similarly, magnetic moments measured along the b\u2212 edge and\nalong the a\u2212 edge are Mb and Ma , respectively. Due to\ntetragonal symmetry, the induced supercurrents can be\nconsidered isotropic in the ab\u2212 plane (we use the designation j for the in-plane supercurrent density), but may\nbe different for the magnetic field oriented perpendicular\nto the c\u2212axis.

(Magnetic field was applied along the\nc\u2212axis (perpendicular to the page) above Tc and removed\nafter cooling to 5 K). Frames (a), (b) and (c) show images\nfor T = 10, 13 and 15 K, respectively. Frame (d) shows a\nthree-dimensional Bean oblique wedge where the z\u2212 axis is\nintensity corresponding to the frame (a).\n\nplanes, the shielding current density is j\u22a5 and for vortices moving parallel to these planes we use jk . Details\nof the anisotropic response will be published elsewhere.40\nFigure 2 shows M (H) loops measured at several temperatures. A noticeable nonmonotonic \"fishtail\" magnetization develops at elevated temperatures. (It presumably exists also at the lower temperatures, but is shifted\nto higher magnetic fields beyond the capabilities of our\nsetup). The left inset in Fig.2 zooms into this temperature interval to show the details of the fishtail evolution with temperature. This behavior is quite similar to\nYBCO single crystals.41,42\nThe situation is quite different when magnetization is\nmeasured with a magnetic field applied along the crystallographic ab\u2212 plane. Figure 3 shows measurements\nperformed with H along the a\u2212 edge of the crystal. No\nnoticeable fishtail behavior is observed. The inset compares M (H) loops at T = 15 K for the two orientations\nwhere the difference is clearly seen. When a magnetic\nfield was applied along the longer b\u2212 edge, the result\nwas the same as in the measurement along the a\u2212 edge\nbut with a different magnitude due to the difference in\nthe cross-section perpendicular to the field. Similar behavior of M (H) in two orientations has been observed\nin several crystals with different aspect ratios varying by\norders of magnitude, which excludes possible geometric\neffects.\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Profiles of the magnetic induction measured in a single crystal Ba(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 at different temperatures along the line shown in Fig. 4(b). Definition of the\nmaximum variation of the magnetic induction, \u2206B is shown\nfor profile obtained at T = 8.5 K.\n\n2.\n\nMagneto-optical imaging\n\nIn order to evaluate the supercurrent density we need\nto examine the structure of the critical state by observing\nthe distribution of the magnetic induction in the sample.\nThe magneto-optical images of a sample from the same\nbatch used in M (H) measurements are shown in Fig.4.\nThe sample dimensions were 0.053 \u00d7 0.24 \u00d7 0.55 mm3 .\nFrames (a), (b), and (c) show the remanent state obtained at T = 10, 13, and 15 K, respectively. Figure 4\n(d) shows a 3D plot where the z\u2212 axis is the magnetic\ninduction. This oblique wedge shape is what is expected\nfrom the Bean critical state model43,44 . We can therefore\nuse this well-known approach to calculate the supercurrent density from the measured magnetization and the\nprofiles of magnetic induction across the sample.\nWe can also examine the profiles of magnetic induction,\nB(r), across the sample obtained along the line shown in\nFig. 4(b). Figure 5 shows such profiles obtained from the\nmeasurements at different temperatures. The shape of\nthe profile is typical for a thin slab-like sample. There is\na clear neutral line due to self-fields that are generated\nby the Bean supercurrents. A graphical definition of the\nmaximum variation of Bz (r), used later for the evaluation of the supercurrent density, is shown for the T = 8.5\nK profile, as an example.\n\n3.\n\nEvaluation of the supercurrent density from various\nmeasurements\n\nWe now extract the supercurrent density from global\nand local magnetic measurements and compare it to di-\n\n\f5\n\nH = 0\n\n40\n\n22.5 K\n\n20.5 K\n\n0\n\n150\n\ndV/dj ( Vcm /A)\n\nV (mV)\n\n20\n\n100\n\n2\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n50\n22.5 K\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n2\n\nj (kA/cm )\n\n-60\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n2\n\nj (kA/cm )\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Voltage as a function of current density\nmeasured at different temperatures in a bar-shaped, 3 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7\n0.02 mm3 , single crystal of Ba(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 with current\napplied along the ab\u2212 plane.

In a single crystal\nthat was still quite thick for transport measurements,\nwe could only induce the transition to the normal state\nin a very limited temperature interval. This was sufficient to overlap with the magnetization data to check\nwhether our indirect calculations of j result in a comparable magnitude of the supercurrent. Sample dimensions\nwere determined in a calibrated optical microscope and\nwe estimate the (systematic) errors on the order of 10%\nfor the evaluated supercurrent density. Random errors\nwere negligible.\nFigure 6 shows current - voltage, V (j), characteristics\nmeasured at different temperatures. The Inset of Fig. 6\nshows a photograph of the sample with the contacts. The\ntemperature dependence of the resistance measured at\ndifferent excitation currents is shown in Fig. 7. The resistance, normalized by the room-temperature value, measured by a two-probe technique between current leads\nand in the conventional four-probe configuration in the\nfull temperature range, is shown in the inset of Fig. 7.\nThe data scales perfectly with the sample geometry, as\nthe distance between contacts for the voltage readings\nare different.\nIn the normal state the V (j) curves remain linear up\nto j \u2248 10 kA/cm2 .

The onset\nof non-zero resistance was used to determine the supercurrent\ndensity. Inset: normalized resistance in a full-temperature\nrange measured by two- and four- probe methods.\n\nof the current density, the voltage crosses over to a linear\ndependence as it should be in the normal state. From\nthese measurements we have determined the value of the\ncritical current density as the point at which the derivative, dV /dj, is maximal as shown in Fig. 6. Though this\ndefinition does not represent the true zero resistivity state\nin the vicinity of Tc , from below the transition this corresponds closely to a point of sharp increase in the measured voltage and is easy to determine. In order to avoid\ndynamic effect related to sweeping the current, we also\nestimated the current density from R(T ) curves measured\nat different values of the bias current. The R(T ) measurements are shown in Fig. 7 and the extracted current\ndensities are compared to those obtained from V (I) and\nmagnetic measurements in the inset Fig. 8. The overall\ntemperature dependence of the supercurrent density obtained at different temperatures by different techniques\nare summarized in Fig. 8.\nTo determine the supercurrent from magnetic measurements, we use the Bean model in which there is a fieldindependent j.43,44 Assuming that j is isotropic in the\ncrystallographic ab\u2212 plane, there are three different current densities depending on the orientation of an external\nmagnetic field with respect to the crystal faces. When\nthe magnetic field is oriented along the d\u2212 edge (crystallographic c\u2212axis), Abrikosov vortices move in the ab\u2212\nplane and gradients in their density induce the supercurrent, j, given by\ncMd \u0010\na \u0011\u22121\n1\u2212\n(1)\na\n3b\nThe other two measured component of volume magnetijab =\n\n\f6\n0.4\n\nH || d-edge\n\n0.03\n\nfrom R(T)\nfrom V(I)\n2\n\nj (MA/cm )\n\nn=1, p=1/4\n2\n\n=1 10\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n2\n\nj (MA/cm )\n\n0.3\n\n-6\n\n0.2\n\nn=3/2, p=1\n2\n\n=5 10\n\n0.1\n\n0.00\n0.90\n\n-5\n\n0.95\n\nT/T\n\n1.00\n\nc\n\nremanent\nfrom M(H)\nMO profiles\ntransport\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nT/T\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nc\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Supercurrent density in same-batch\nsingle crystals Ba(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 . \"Magnetic\" current\ndensity estimated from Eq. 1 at zero applied field by annealing of the remanent magnetization (filled circles), from\nM (H) loops measured at different temperatures (squares),\nfrom magneto-optical profiles using Eq. 2 (stars), and from\ndirect transport measurements (open circles).

It is worth\nnoting that the total magnetization and magneto-optics\nare two very different measurements performed under different experimental conditions. The only common part\nof the analysis is the Bean model used for data analysis.\nIf this assumption is invalid, the resulting supercurrent\ndensities will be very different. The variation of magnetic\ninduction, \u2206B = |Bz (0) \u2212 Bz (edge)| in the full critical\nstate is given by45\n\u00012\n1 + 4\u03b7 2\nc\u2206B\np\n+ 2 arctan (2\u03b7) \u2212 arctan (\u03b7)\n= \u03b7 ln\n4ja\n16\u03b7 3 1 + \u03b7 2\n(2)\nwhere \u03b7 = d/a. In the sample used for MO study,\n\u03b7 \u2248 0.22 and Eq. 2 yields j \u2248 194\u2206B. Note that if\ninstead of using Eq. 2 one would use the straightforward Bean model for a semi-infinite slab (we still measure the z\u2212 component of B on the surface), then the\nestimated current density would be significantly lower,\nj = c/(2\u03c0a)\u2206B \u2248 133\u2206B.\n\nWe first analyze the supercurrent density for zero applied field. Figure 8 shows the supercurrent density estimated from magnetization, magneto-optical, and direct\ntransport measurements. From magnetization, the current was obtained from two types of measurements. First,\na full remanent state was induced at 5 K by cooling in a 5\nT magnetic field and then turning the field off. Then, this\nremanent state was slowly warmed up, allowing the temperature to stabilize before the measurement was taken.\nThis convenient method is relatively quick and produces\na curve with many data points. However, it is unclear\nwhether we probe the original critical state relaxed only\nduring the time window \u2206t, characteristic of our magnetometer, or the supercurrent has relaxed more and we are\nprobing a deeply relaxed state. Therefore, we have used\nM (H = 0) values directly from the magnetization loops\nmeasured at different temperatures and plot the resulting j as open squares in Fig.8. The data simply falls on\ntop of the curve obtained from the annealing of the remanent state (filled circles). The explanation is that the\nchange of temperature occurs during a relatively short\nperiod of time, comparable to the time of setting and stabilizing the magnetic field in the superconducting magnet of the MPMS magnetometer during the field ramp.\nThe supercurrent density evaluated from Eq.2 (shown by\nstars in Fig. 8) compares well with the magnetization\ndata. Finally, the inset in Fig. 8 compares the supercurrent obtained from magnetic measurements with direct\ntransport measurements. There is good agreement between all datasets. We therefore conclude that, similar\nto NdFeAsO1\u2212x Fx 21 , the supercurrent density in single\ncrystals Ba(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 is relatively low even at\nlow temperatures, j (T = 5K, H = 0) \u2243 2.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 105\nA/cm2 , which is comparable to Y-Ba-Cu-O single crystals. As for the functional form of jc (T ), we can use\nthe generalized power law that is usually used for sup n\nperconductors, j(T ) = j(0) (1 \u2212 (T /Tc ) ) , which gives\nthe best fit to the experimental data (most data points\n- solid symbols) with j(0) \u2248 0.88 MA/cm2 , p = 1/4 and\np = 1. An attempt to fit with p = 1 and n = 3/2 is also\nshown in Fig. 8 and is inferior to the former fit, which\nis reflected in an order of magnitude larger adjusted \u03c72\nvalue. Next we present unexpected results obtained in\na magnetic field. Using the annealing method described\nabove for the remanent state, but this time annealing the\ninduced critical state in finite fields, we have obtained a\nset of j (H = const, T ) curves for different values of H.\nThe result is shown in Fig. 9. There is an apparent pronounced decrease in the current density marked by open\ncircles. Similarly, the temperature at which jab \u2192 0 is\nalso marked. While the meaning of the former signature\nwill become clear below when we discuss the H \u2212 T diagram, the latter feature is obviously the experimental\nirreversibility line above which pinning is negligible and\nthe vortex liquid sets in.\n\n\f7\n1.30x10\n\nH || d-edge\n\n-2\n\nalong d - edge\n\n0.00\n\n0\n\nln(M/M )\n\nT = 15 K\n\n0.10\n\n-0.05\n\n1 T\n-0.10\n\n0.05\n\n3 T\n\nH = 1 T\n-0.15\n4\n0.013\n\n1.20x10\n\n-2\n\n5\n\nM (emu)\n\nM (emu)\n\n2\n\nj (MA/cm )\n\n1.25x10\n\n0.1 h\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n,\n\nU\n\n0\n\n564 K,\n\nt\n\n6\n\n8\n\nln(t)\n0\n\n2\n\ns\n\n22 h\n\n0.012\n\n0.5 T\n5 T\n\n1.15x10\n0.00\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 9: (Color online) j (T ) measured in a single crystal\nBa(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 upon warming up at different values of\nthe magnetic applied field as explained in the text. Open circles mark the temperature of the vanishing current as well as\nthe temperatures at which j (T ) curves exhibit an apparent\nchange of behavior.\n\nB.\n\nMagnetic relaxation\n\nWhen the fishtail effect is observed, one must examine\nthe magnetic relaxation of the critical state as a function\nof temperature and magnetic field. While some theories\nsuggest a static explanation for the fishtail effect, which\nmost likely works in alloys, ceramics, and materials with\nsecondary phases, in single crystals it seems that a dynamic scenario is more plausible, at least in the high-Tc\ncuprates.7,37 Within collective pinning and creep models,\nthe magnetic relaxation rate decreases with the increase\nof a magnetic field. Since the true critical current density, jc (H), also decreases with the increase of a magnetic field, an apparent fishtail develops in the measured\nmagnetization.37 Therefore, the fishtail phenomenon is\na direct consequence of the collective pining and creep\ntheory. However, more detailed measurements above the\npeak position have forced us to revisit this picture and\nuse a refined model that involves both field-dependent\nrelaxation rates and a transition from a collective flux\ncreep mechanism at the lower fields to a plastic creep\n(mediated by dislocations in the vortex lattice).42 The\nlatter predicts an increasing relaxation rate with the increase of the magnetic field, whereas the former predicts\na monotonic decrease of the relaxation rate.\nBased on the various models of magnetic relaxation,\nGriessen et al. has suggested a very useful generic form\nof the barrier for flux creep.46\n\u0014\u0012 \u0013\u03b1\n\u0015\njc\nU0\n\u22121\n(3)\nU (j) =\n\u03b1\nj\nThis formula describes all the widely-accepted func-\n\n-2\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\ntime (h)\n\n0.1\n\n15\n\n1\n\n10\n\ntime (hours)\n\nFIG. 10: (Color online)Time - dependent magnetization measured for 22 hours at T = 15 K at H = 1 T after ramping\nfield from 5 T.

For \u03b1 = \u22121, Eq.\n3 describes the classical Anderson-Kim barrier, which is\nsimply linear in j/jc 47,48 . For \u03b1 = \u22121/2 the barrier\nfor plastic creep42 is obtained. Positive \u03b1 describes collective creep barriers5. In the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0, this formula reproduces exactly the logarithmic barrier.49 An\nactivation energy, written in the form of Eq. 3, results\nin a so-called interpolation formula for flux creep5 obtained when the logarithmic solution of the creep equation U (j/jc ) = T ln(1 + t/t0 )35 is applied (for \u03b1 6= 0),\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013\u2212 \u03b11\n\u03b1T\nt\nln\nM (t) = Mc 1 +\nU0\nt0\n\n(4)\n\nFor \u03b1 = 0, a power-law decay is obtained: M (t) =\nn\nMc (t0 /t) , where n = T /U0 . A generalization of the\nflux creep theory beyond the logarithmic solution with\napplications to collective creep and the fishtail effect are\ngiven by Burlachkov, Giller, and Prozorov.37\nIndeed, no single equation for relaxation is applicable for all values of j/jc . Within the collective creep\ntheory, the magnetic relaxation has different functional\nforms (roughly described by using different U0 and \u03b1 in\nEq.3) depending on whether one considers the regime of a\nsingle-vortex, small vortex bundles, or large ones5 . Trying to find the best fit to Eq. 4 in the widest time-interval,\nwe have determined that the small-bundle regime describes the data shown in Fig. 10 quite well. The fit\nis shown in the lower inset. The fit parameters are reasonable within the collective creep model, as \u03b1 = 5/2\n(fixed during fitting), U0 = 564 K, and t0 = 2 \u03bcs.\nWe now examine relaxation magnetic fields above and\nbelow the peak position, Hp (T ).

Its functional form is also quite different. The magnetic field dependence on the relaxation rate is presented in Fig. 11.\nHere, each M (H = const, t) trace is plotted along with\nthe regular magnetization loop.\nA useful characteristic of the flux creep is the logarithmic relaxation rate, R = \u2212 |d ln M/d ln t|. From Eq.4 we\nobtain,\n\ntrend when a magnetic field is applied along the ab\u2212\nplane. We therefore conclude that the collective creep\nmodel fails above Hp .\nAnother difference between the relaxation rates comes\nfrom examining the temperature dependence of R. Figure 13 compares R (T ) measured in zero field (self-field of\nthe remanent state) for three different orientations (along\nthree of the edges of the crystal). When vortices are parallel to the ab\u2212 plane, the relaxation rates are practically\n\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013\u22121\n\u03b1T\nt\n1+\nln\nU0\nt0\n\n0.030\n\n(5)\n\nEven at the longest time that we have probed (22\nhours), the logarithmic term is equal to 1.6, so the relaxation rate only decreases by a factor of about 2.6 compared to the initial (but not too close to t = 0) rate,\nR \u2243 T /U0 , which at 15 K and 1 T is about R = 0.027.\nThis value is much larger than the rate for conventional\nsuperconductors, but is quite similar to high-Tc compounds.7 Thus, single crystals of Ba(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2\nexhibit \"giant flux creep\". The magnetic field dependence of R is summarized in Fig. 11 (right axis). At\nfirst, it decreases with the increase of H, up to the field,\nHp , corresponding to the maximum in the fishtail M (H)\ncurve. Above Hp the relaxation rate increases with the\nincrease of H, which contradicts the collective creep theory. To clarify whether this behavior is related to the\nfishtail phenomenon, we have measured the magnetic relaxation rate with the magnetic field applied along the a\u2212\nedge and we did not observe a fishtail feature (Fig. 3).\nFigure 12 compares the relaxation rates in the two orientations.

These and later works showed\nthat in superconducting crystals with relatively weak pinning, the crossover from elastic to plastic creep always\naccompanies fishtail magnetization. However, it should\nbe noted that the fishtail feature itself is still due to peculiarities of the collective creep when the relaxation rate is\nfaster for lower fields, H < Hp . Within the plastic creep\nscenario, thermally activated vortex motion is not due\nto jumps of vortex bundles, but due to sliding of dislocations in the vortex lattice (even in a very disordered state,\none can consider a local ordered arrangement of vortices\nand dislocations as primary defects). The main result\nof this approach is that the barrier for magnetic relaxation in the plastic creep\nremains\nfinite as j \u2192 0,\n\u0010 regime\n\u0011\np\nUpl (B, j/jc ) = Upl (B) 1 \u2212 j/jc and decreases with\n\u221a\nincreasing magnetic field as Upl (B) \u223c 1/ B, because\nthe elementary movement of a dislocation\nis proportional\n\u221a\nto the intervortex distance, a \u223c 1/ B. Collective creep\nbarriers, on the other hand, increase with increasing magnetic field as Uc (B) \u223c B \u03bd , where \u03bd is positive and depends on the particular pinning regime. The j dependence is given by Eq.3 with a positive \u03b1 that results in a\n\u03b1\ndiverging barrier, Uc (j/jc ) \u223c (j/jc ) . At low fields, the\n\nH\n\n5\nc\n\nthe same. For magnetic relaxation in the remanent state\nobtained along the c\u2212 axis, R (T ) shows a similar functional dependence and is shifted slightly to lower temperatures. In contrast, the relaxation rate obtained above\nHp shows a very different behavior - increasing with the\nincrease of temperature. The bell-shaped R (T ) are observed in many superconductors with weak pinning. No\nstraightforward explanation exists, but it seems plausible\nthat while the bare barrier for the magnetic relaxation,\nUT,j=0 , decreases with the increase of temperature, the\nratio j/jc at which the relaxation takes place in the experiment with the fixed time window \u2206t decreases with\nthe increase of temperature. Therefore, the actual barrier experienced by the vortex bundles, Eq. 5, may become non-monotonic with temperature. In other words,\nthe exponent \u03b1 is temperature dependent and from the\ncollective creep theory it follows that it is nonmonotonic with the bundle size, peaking at \u03b1 = 5/2 for small\nbundles5 . By substituting this into Eq. 5 with the appropriate UT,j=0 (T ), the nonmonotonic R (T ) can be reproduced. This provides additional indirect evidence for the\napplicability of the collective creep approach to vortex\nrelaxation in single crystalline Ba(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 at\nfields below Hp . Using the same arguments, one can show\nthat plastic creep, which corresponds to \u03b1 = \u22121/2 cannot lead to such behavior and the relaxation rate should\njust increase with temperature, which is what we observe\nin Fig. 13.\n\nfrom j(T)\n\nalong d-edge (c-axis)\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 14: (Color online) Vortex H \u2212T phase diagram obtained\nfrom various features in the described measurements and the\nsolid lines are the fits as discussed in the text.\n\ncollective barrier is always smaller than the plastic barrier\nand this channel dominates the vortex dynamics. However, as the magnetic field is increased, a crossover from a\ncollective to a plastic channel of vortex relaxation occurs\nwhen Upl (B, j/jc ) becomes smaller than Ucol (B, j/jc ).\nFinally, Fig. 14 presents the vortex phase diagram of\nBa(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 single crystals compiled from our\nresults. It closely resembles diagrams for the cuprate superconductors, in particular YBCO single crystals. The\nprominent features are the irreversibility line that is quite\ndistant from the Hc2 (T ) line and a clear crossover line\nbetween collective and plastic creep regimes. As is usually the case, the data can be described by the general\np n\npower law, Hxx (T ) = Hxx (0) (1 \u2212 (T /Tc) ) , shown in\nFig. 14 by solid lines. We obtained for the fishtail peak\nposition, Hp (T ), Hp (0) \u2248 13.6 T, n = 3/2, and p = 1.\nFor the irreversibility line, Hirr (T ), Hirr (0) \u2248 15.2 T,\nn = 3/2, and p = 2. For the second critical field, Hc2 (T ),\nHc2 (0) \u2248 66.7 T, n = 4/3, and p = 1.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, detailed measurements of global and\nlocal electromagnetic properties clearly show that the\nvortex behavior in single crystalline superconducting\nBa(Fe0.93 Co0.07 )2 As2 is similar to that found in the high\nTc cuprates. In particular, we report the presence of\na fishtail feature in M (H, T = const) loops and find its\nsignature in M (H = const, T ) measurements. Furthermore, magnetic relaxation measurements are consistent\nwith the collective pinning and creep models (weak pinning and fast creep) and suggest a crossover into the plastic creep regime in fields exceeding the value correspond-\n\n\f10\ning to the maximum in fishtail magnetization.\nAcknowledgments\n\nat the Ames Laboratory was supported by the Department of Energy-Basic Energy Sciences under Contract\nNo.DE-AC02-07CH11358.
