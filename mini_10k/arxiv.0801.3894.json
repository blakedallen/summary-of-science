It is of the form\n\u2202t u + \u2202x3 u + \u2202x (u2 ) = 0\n\n1\n\n(1.1)\n\n\fwhere the space variable x is in R. The results of this paper could easily be\nextended to generalized subcritical KdV equations for which the nonlinearity\nis \u2202x (up ) for p < 5, but we consider throughout this article the p = 2 case for\nsimplicity. The KdV equation is famous for its soliton solutions confirming the\nobservation of the solitary wave propagating on a channel by Russell in 1844.\nThese solitons are traveling waves of the form uc,x0 (t, x) = \u03c6c (x \u2212 ct + x0 ) where\nc is the constant velocity, x0 \u2208 R is the initial phase and\n\u03c6c (x) =\n\n3c\n\u221a\n2 cosh2 ( cx/2)\n\n(1.2)\n\nThese waves are localized, i.e. they decay exponentially to zero as x goes to\ninfinity. Their shape is stable against perturbations of the initial state. A first\nnotion of stability, for initial data close to \u03c6c , which takes into account the\nsymmetries of the evolution equation, is that of orbital stability. This notion\nof stability was first considered, for the solution \u03c6c (x \u2212 ct + x0 ) of the KdV\nequation, by Benjamin [1]. The set {\u03c6c (* \u2212 s), s \u2208 R} is the orbit of \u03c6c . The\nfunctional Qc (u) = H(u)+ cM(u) is used as a Lyapunov functional in the proof.\nIt involves two important invariant quantities of the evolution equation (1.1):\nthe Hamiltonian, defined for u in H1 (R), the space of square integrable functions\nwith square integrable first order derivatives, by\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n2\nH (u) =\n(\u2202x u(x)) dx \u2212\nu3 (x)dx\n(1.3)\n2 R\n3 R\nand the mass defined by\nM (u) =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nu2 (x)dx.\n\n(1.4)\n\nR\n\nThe space H1 (R) is the energy space, and it is a natural space for the solutions of (1.1) : indeed, if u \u2208 C([0, T ]; H1 (R)) is a solution of (1.1), then\nH(u(t)) = H(u0 ) and M(u(t)) = M(u0 ) for any t \u2208 [0, T ], where u0 is the\ninitial datum in H1 . The shape of the soliton \u03c6c is a solution of the constrained\nvariational problem which consists in minimizing the Hamiltonian for a constant\nmass. Orbital stability means that when the initial datum is close to \u03c6c in H1\nthen the solution remains close to the orbit of \u03c6c . The second stronger notion\nof stability is that of asymptotic stability. It states that, for initial datum close\nin H1 to \u03c6c , the solution converges in some sense as time goes to infinity to\na soliton where the velocity and phase have been shifted. Convergence may\ncorrespond to weak convergence in H1 , see [15] or [16], or strong convergence\nin some weighted Sobolev space, see [17], for less general perturbations of the\ninitial datum, when the solution is written in the soliton reference frame. Note\nthat strong convergence in H1 is not expected due to the possibility of a dispersive tail moving away from the soliton as time goes to infinity.\nIt is often physically relevant to consider random perturbations of equation\n(1.1), see [19]. It is also interesting from a theoretical perspective to study the\n2\n\n\fstability of the soliton shape under these random perturbations. We consider as\nin [19] the case of an additive noise which could model a random pressure at the\nsurface of the water. The corresponding stochastic partial differential equation\n(SPDE for short) written in It\u00f4 form is the following\n\u0001\ndu + \u2202x3 u + \u2202x (u2 ) dt = \u01ebdW\n(1.5)\n\nwhere (W (t))t\u22650 is a Wiener process and \u01eb is the small noise amplitude. As we\nwork in infinite dimensions, and in the absence of global smoothing property of\nthe group S(t) on H1 associated to the unbounded operator \u2212\u2202x3 , W needs to\nbe a proper Wiener process on H1 . Thus, the components of W (1) need to be\ncorrelated for the law of W (1) to be a bona-fide Gaussian measure. It can then\nalways be seen as the direct image via a Hilbert-Schmidt self-adjoint mapping\n\u03a6 of a cylindrical measure and we assume that \u03a6 is a mapping from L2 into\nH1 . Recall that \u03a6 is Hilbert-Schmidt from L2 into H1 if it is a bounded\nlinear\nP\n2\noperator and for a complete orthonormal system (ei )i\u2208N of L2 , i\u2208N k\u03a6ei kH1\nis finite. The sum does not depend on the complete orthonormal system and,\nendowed with its square root as a norm, the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators\nL2 (L2 , H1 ) = L0,1\nis a Hilbert space. As a consequence, the Wiener process\n2\ncould be written as\nX\nW (t, x) =\n\u03b2i (t)\u03a6ei (x), t \u2265 0, x \u2208 R\n(1.6)\ni\u2208N\n\nwhere (\u03b2i )i\u2208N is a collection of independent standard real valued Brownian motions and (ei )i\u2208N a complete orthonormal system of L2 . Existence of path-wise\nmild solutions, almost surely continuous in time for all t positive with values\nin H1 , of the SPDE supplemented with the initial datum u(0) = u0 \u2208 H1\nand uniqueness among\nthose having almost surely paths in some subspace\n\u0001\nXT \u2282 C [0, T ]; H1 has been obtained in [3]. In [6, 7] global well posedness\nis obtained for rougher noises and less regular solutions. It should be noticed\nthat in the physics literature the space-time white noise, corresponding to \u03a6 = I\nis often considered, which we are not able to treat mathematically. For simplicity, we consider the sequence of operators\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121/2\n1 2\nk\n\u03a6n = I \u2212 \u2206 + (x I \u2212 \u2206)\n,\nn\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhich are Hilbert-Schmidt from L2 into H1 for k large enough, in order to prove\nlower bounds on exit times. As n goes to infinity the Hilbert-Schmidt assumption tends to be relaxed and the noise mimics a spatially homogeneous noise\nwith covariance (I \u2212 \u2206)\u22121 , which is a white noise in the Hilbert space H1 . It\nshould also be noted that these operators are uniformly bounded in the space\nL0,1 of bounded operators from L2 into H1 ; indeed we have for every integer\nn, k\u03a6n kL0,1 \u2264 1. It is possible to work with a more general approximating\nsequence, see for example the kind of assumptions made in [8].\n\n3\n\n\fThe linearized operator around the soliton is particularly interesting to study\nthe stability. It has a general null-space spanned by the two secular modes \u2202x \u03c6c\nand \u2202c \u03c6c . These modes are associated with infinitesimal changes in the velocity\nand location of the solitary wave. In Remark 2.3 in [5], the following heuristic\nargument then implies that the random solution should at most remain close\nto the deterministic solution up to times of the order \u01eb\u22122/3 . It is based on an\nanalogy with the behavior of a linear system of SDEs such that 0 is a degenerate\nsimple eigenvalue corresponding to a Jordan block\n\u001a\ndX1 = X2 dt + \u01ebdW1 (t)\ndX2 = \u01ebdW2 (t)\nwith Brownian motions W1 and W2 . In such a case,\nZ T\nX1 (T ) = \u01eb\nW2 (s)ds + \u01ebW1 (T )\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\nhas variance of the order of \u01eb T for large T . Thus, for a first approximation of\nthe solution u\u01eb,\u03c6c0 of (1.5) with initial datum \u03c6c0 , of the form\nu\u01eb,\u03c6c0 (t, x) = \u03c6c0 (x \u2212 c0 t) + \u01eb\u03b7\u0303 \u01eb (t, x \u2212 c0 t),\n\n(1.8)\n\nand with an exit time defined for a neighborhood of the soliton in H1\n\b\nB (\u03c6c0 , \u03b1) = f \u2208 H1 : kf \u2212 \u03c6c0 kH1 < \u03b1\n\nby\n\nc\n\n\u03c4\u0303\u03b1\u01eb = inf {t \u2208 [0, \u221e) : u\u01eb,\u03c6c0 (t, * + c0 t) \u2208 B (\u03c6c0 , \u03b1) } ,\n\nexit is expected to occur on a time scale of the order of \u01eb\u22122/3 . However, it is\nbelieved that the soliton shape is preserved over a longer time scale. A general\napproach which works for the deterministic equation, see [15, 17], is to introduce\na description by a soliton ansatz where the parameters of the soliton fluctuate\nwith time. In the case of an additive noise physicists use an approximation of the\nsolution by a soliton ansatz of the form \u03c6c\u01eb (t) (x \u2212 x\u01eb (t)) where c\u01eb (t) and x\u01eb (t)\nare random scalar processes evolving according to a system of coupled SDEs.\nIn the case where the noise is the time derivative of a one dimensional standard\nBrownian motion, it is easily seen (see [20]) that the solution can be written as\na modulated soliton plus a Brownian motion. However, proving such a result\nis more involved when the noise is a function of space as well. A mathematical\njustification is given in [5] where the following result is proved.\nTheorem 1.1 For \u01eb > 0 and c0 > 0, there exists \u03b10 > 0 such that for every\n\u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03b10 ] there exists a stopping time \u03c4\u03b1\u01eb > 0 a.s. and semi-martingales c\u01eb (t)\nand x\u01eb (t) defined a.s. for t \u2264 \u03c4\u03b1\u01eb with values in (0, \u221e) and R respectively such\nthat if we set\n\u01eb\u03b7 \u01eb (t) = u\u01eb,\u03c6c0 (t, * + x\u01eb (t)) \u2212 \u03c6c\u01eb (t)\n\nthen\n\nZ\n\n\u03b7 \u01eb (t, x)\u03c6c0 (x)dx = (\u03b7 \u01eb , \u03c6c0 ) = 0,\n\nR\n\n4\n\n\u2200t \u2264 \u03c4\u03b1\u01eb\n\na.s.,\n\n(1.9)\n\n\fZ\n\n\u2200t \u2264 \u03c4\u03b1\u01eb\n\n\u03b7 \u01eb (t, x)\u2202x \u03c6c0 (x)dx = (\u03b7 \u01eb , \u2202x \u03c6c0 ) = 0,\n\nR\n\nand for all t \u2264 \u03c4\u03b1\u01eb ,\n\na.s.\n\n(1.10)\n\nk\u01eb\u03b7 \u01eb (t)kH1 \u2264 \u03b1\n\n(1.11)\n\n|c\u01eb (t) \u2212 c0 | \u2264 \u03b1.\n\n(1.12)\n\nand\nMoreover, there exists C > 0 such that for all T > 0 and \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b10 there exists\n\u01eb0 > 0 such that for all \u01eb < \u01eb0 ,\nP (\u03c4\u03b1\u01eb \u2264 T ) \u2264\n\nC\u01eb2 T k\u03a6kL0,1\n2\n\n\u03b14\n\n.\n\n(1.13)\n\nThe proof uses the Lyapunov functional Qc as a central tool. The equations (1.9)\nand (1.10) are such that restricted to this subspace, the Lyapunov functional\nis coercive, i.e. the operator Q\u2032\u2032c0 is positive. It allows to keep |c\u01eb (t) \u2212 c0 | and\nk\u01eb\u03b7 \u01eb (t)kH1 small on a longer time interval. Also, these two conditions together\nwith the implicit function theorem allow to obtain c\u01eb and x\u01eb . Other results in\n[5] give the asymptotic distribution of \u03b7 \u01eb as \u01eb goes to zero as well as coupled\nequations for the evolution of the random scalar parameters. The parameters\nand remainder do not depend on \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b10 . In the upper bound (1.13) the product \u01eb2 T appears. The theorem says that the solution stays in a neighborhood\nof the randomly modulated soliton \u03c6c\u01eb (t) (x \u2212 x\u01eb (t)) with high probability at\nleast for times small compared to \u01eb\u22122 . The time spent in a neighborhood of\na soliton-like wave, when the initial datum gives rise to a soliton for \u01eb = 0, is\ncalled the persistence time, see [9] for numerical confirmations that the above\norder is the right order.\nIn this paper we first study the exit time \u03c4\u0303\u03b1\u01eb and obtain that the time scale\non which the solution stays close to the deterministic soliton is indeed at most\nof the order of \u01eb\u22122/3 . We then revisit the upper bound (1.13) and prove a\nsharper exponential bound. This bound is supplemented with an exponential\nlower bound of the same order in the parameters T and \u01eb. We thus obtain the\nright order of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exit time off\nneighborhoods of the randomly modulated soliton. This gives a confirmation\nthat the time scale on which the approximation of the solution by a randomly\nmodulated soliton is valid is of the order \u01eb\u22122 . Our main tools are large deviations along with a study of the associated variational problems. Similarly,\nfactors T and T 3 have also been obtained in the study of the tails of the mass\nand arrival time for stochastic nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations (NLS) in [8, 13]\nwith the same techniques. These quantities are the main processes impairing\nsoliton transmission in optical fibers. In that setting, physicists again use the\napproximation by a randomly modulated soliton. An analogue of Theorem 1.1\nfor stochastic NLS equations would allow to tell up to what length of the fiber\nline the approximation is licit. Large deviations are also known to be a useful\n5\n\n\ftool to study the exit problem from an asymptotic equilibrium point or noised\ninduced transition between several equilibrium points in the small noise limit\n(see [12], and [14] for an exit problem for stochastic weakly damped nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation). Here we however study a simpler problem than the\nescape from the asymptotically stable central manifold for the KdV equation\nwhich we hope to study in future works.\n\n2\n\nLarge deviations and escape from a neighborhood of the soliton\n\nWe use sample path large deviations in this article in order to obtain lower\nbounds of the asymptotic as n goes to infinity and \u01eb goes to zero of probabilities P (\u03c4 n,\u01eb \u2264 T ) where \u03c4 n,\u01eb is the exit time of a neighborhood of either the\ndeterministic soliton or the randomly modulated soliton. The n recalls that we\nconsider a sequence of operators \u03a6n , see (1.7). Large deviation techniques, see\nfor example [10, 11], allow to quantify convergence to zero of rare events. For\nexample, it is easy to check that on a finite time interval [0, T ], the paths of\nthe solution of 1.5 starting form \u03c6c0 converge in probability to the paths of the\ndeterministic soliton solution. The probability that exit from a neighborhood\nof the soliton occurs before T goes to zero as \u01eb goes to zero. Large deviations\nquantify the convergence to zero of such probabilities. Following Varadhan's\nformalism, large deviations could be stated as a sequence of inequalities called a\nlarge deviation principle (LDP for short). The convergence to zero of the logarithm of the probabilities of rare events is characterized by a speed, here \u01eb2 , and\na deterministic functional I n depending on the operator \u03a6n considered, called\nrate function, to be minimized on the closure and interior of the set defining\nthe rare event in the state space. In the small noise asymptotics and for sample\npath large deviations, the rate function could be expressed in terms of the mild\nsolution of the control problem\n\u001a\n\u2202t u + \u2202x3 u + \u2202x (u2 ) = \u03a6n h,\n\u0001\n(2.1)\nu(0) = \u03c6c0 and h \u2208 L2 0, T ; L2 .\n\nWe denote the solution by Sn,\u03c6c0 (h). The mapping h \u2192 Sn,\u03c6c0 (h) is called the\ncontrol map and (2.1) the control equation. We recall that a rate function I on\nthe sample space (here the paths space C([0, T ]; H1 )) is lower semicontinuous\nand that a good rate function is such that I \u22121 ([0, R]) is compact for every R\npositive.\nn,\u01eb,\u03c6c0 \u0001\nof the paths of the solutions of (1.5) for\nTheorem 2.1 The laws \u03bcu\n\u01eb>0\nthe operator \u03a6 = \u03a6n on C([0, T ]; H1 ) with initial datum \u03c6c0 satisfy a LDP of\nspeed \u01eb2 and good rate function\nI n (w) =\n\n1\ninf\nkhk2L2 (0,T ;L2 ) .\n2 h\u2208L2 (0,T ;L2 ): w=Sn,\u03c6c0 (h)\n\n6\n\n\f\u0001\nIt means that for every Borel set B of C [0, T ]; H1 , we have the lower bound\n\u2212\n\ninf\n\n\u25e6\nw \u2208 B\n\nI n (w) \u2264 lim\u01eb\u21920 \u01eb2 log P (un,\u01eb,\u03c6c0 \u2208 B)\n\nand the upper bound\nlim\u01eb\u21920 \u01eb2 log P (un,\u01eb,\u03c6c0 \u2208 B) \u2264 \u2212 inf I n (w).\nw\u2208B\n\nThe proof\nuses the LDP for the laws of the stochastic convolution \u01ebZ where\nRt\nZ(t) = 0 S(t\n\u0001 \u2212 s)dW (s) on the Banach path space XT ; it is a subspace of\nC [0, T ]; H1 where the fixed point argument proving the local well-posedness\nis used, see [3]. The stochastic convolution appears when we write the equation\nsatisfied by the mild solution of (1.5). These laws are Gaussian measures and\nthe LDP is a consequence of the general result on LDP for centered Gaussian\nmeasures on real Banach spaces, see [11]. The second step is to prove the continuity of the mapping which, to\u0001 the perturbation Z in XT assigns the solution\nun,1,\u03c6c0 := G(Z) in C [0, T ]; H1 . It is obtained noting that G(Z) = v(Z) + Z\nwhere v(x) denotes the solution of\n\u0001\n\u001a\n\u2202t v + \u2202x3 v + \u2202x (v + Z)2 = 0\nv(0) = \u03c6c0 .\nThen the continuity of G is a consequence of the continuity of v with respect\nto the perturbation Z. It could be proved as in [4] where the stochastic NLS\nequation is considered. LDP for the paths of the mild solution of the SPDE is\nthen obtained by a direct application of the contraction principle which states\nthat we can push forward LDP for measures on a Hausdorff topological space to\na LDP for direct image measures on another Hausdorff topological space when\nthe mapping is continuous. More details on the proof of such LDP are given in\n[13] where the stochastic NLS equation with additive noise is considered. The\ncontrol map SH,\u03c6c0 (h) for the theoretical stochastic equation with spatially\nhomogeneous noise is defined as the mild solution of\n\u001a\n\u2202t u + \u2202x3 u + \u2202x (u2 ) = \u03a6H h,\n\u0001\n(2.2)\nu(0) = \u03c6c0 and h \u2208 L2 0, T ; L2 ,\n\nwhere \u03a6H = (I \u2212 \u2206)\u22121/2 . Note that though we cannot give a mathematical\nmeaning to the stochastic equation with such homogeneous noise, the corresponding control map is well defined.\n\nLet us now consider the exit times \u03c4\u0303\u03b1n,\u01eb . Note that we only consider here\na lower bound of the probability since it is enough to prove the heuristic of\nRemark 2.3 in [5]. Recall that we want to check that the time scale on which\nthe approximation by the deterministic soliton is licit is at most of the order\nof \u01eb\u22122/3 . When studying the exit times \u03c4\u03b1n,\u01eb , however, we give both upper and\nlower bounds of the tail probabilities of the same order in the parameters \u01eb and\nT.\n7\n\n\fProposition 2.2 Take T , c0 positive; then for \u03b10 small enough, for every \u03b1 <\n\u03b10 , there exists a constant C(\u03b1, c0 ) which depends on \u03b1 and c0 but not on T\nsuch that\nC(\u03b1, c0 )\nlimn\u2192\u221e lim\u01eb\u21920 \u01eb2 log P (\u03c4\u0303\u03b1n,\u01eb \u2264 T ) \u2265 \u2212\n.\nT3\nProof. For fixed n, using Theorem 2.1, lim\u01eb\u21920 \u01eb log P (\u03c4\u0303\u03b1n,\u01eb \u2264 T ) is larger than\no\nn\n1\n\u2212 inf khk2L2 (0,T ;L2 ) , h : kSn,\u03c6c0 (h)(T ) \u2212 \u03c6c0 (* \u2212 c0 T )kH1 > \u03b1 .\n2\nIn a first step, we consider the preceding variational problem in which the operator \u03a6n is replaced by the operator \u03a6H = (I \u2212 \u2206)\u22121/2 and \u03b1 is replaced by 2\u03b1.\nWe give upper bounds on the infimum by minimizing on smaller and smaller\nsets of controls, until we are able to handle the variational problem. Note that\nup to now, the problem is a control problem for the KdV equation that we\ncannot handle. We will show that we can work on more restrictive classes of\ncontrols and still obtain a nice qualitative order. Using the Sobolev embedding\nof H1 into L\u221e , with norm C\u221e , the infimum is found to be less than\nn\no\ninf khk2L2 (0,T ;L2 ) , h : SH,\u03c6c0 (h)(T ) \u2212 \u03c6c0 (* \u2212 c0 T ) L\u221e > 2C\u221e \u03b1\nsince we then minimize on a smaller set.

In the next section we prove that the time\nscale on which the solution remains close to the randomly modulated soliton is\nexactly of the much longer order \u01eb\u22122 . We provide upper and lower bounds for\nthis result.\n\n3\n\nEscape from a neighborhood of the randomly\nmodulated soliton\n\nIn the proof of Theorem 2.1 in [5] a local parametrization u 7\u2192 (C(u), X (u))\nis used, in order to obtain parameters of the soliton wave form such that u =\n\u03c6C(u) (*\u2212X (u))+R(u) with R satisfying some adequate orthogonality conditions.\nThis parametrization is obtained using the implicit function theorem, imposing\nthat the constraints (1.9) and (1.10) hold. Such a parametrization holds as long\nas u remains in a proper neighborhood of the spatial translates of \u03c6c0 ; thus,\nsetting c\u01eb (t) = C(u\u01eb,\u03c6c0 (t)) and x\u01eb (t) = X (u\u01eb,\u03c6c0 (t)), with u\u01eb,\u03c6c0 a solution of\n(1.5) with paths a.s. in C1 (R+ ; H1 ) and initial datum \u03c6c0 , the processes c\u01eb (t)\nand x\u01eb (t) are well defined adapted processes, up to a stopping time of the form\n\u03c4 \u01eb\u03b1 = inf {t \u2265 0, |c\u01eb (t) \u2212 c0 | \u2265 \u03b1 or ku\u01eb,\u03c6c0 (t, * + x\u01eb (t)) \u2212 \u03c6c0 kH1 \u2265 \u03b1} .\nWe can indeed always replace a function u by the function u(*+ X (u)) and come\nback to the case where x\u01eb (t) is close to 0, and it is not necessary to include a\ncondition of the form |x\u01eb (t)| \u2265 \u03b1. It is also shown that this stopping time could\nbe bounded above and below by\n\b\n\u01eb\n\u03c4C\u03b1\n= inf t \u2265 0, |c\u01eb (t) \u2212 c0 | \u2265 \u03b1 or ku\u01eb,\u03c6c0 (t, * + x\u01eb (t)) \u2212 \u03c6c\u01eb (t) kH1 \u2265 \u03b1\n\nfor some constants C depending solely on c0 and \u03b10 , with 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b10 . Hence,\nthe two stopping times are equivalent and the qualitative behavior of P(\u03c4\u03b1\u01eb \u2264 T )\nwith respect to \u01eb and T should be the same as the original P(\u03c4 \u01eb\u03b1 \u2264 T ). These\nnew stopping times \u03c4\u03b1\u01eb prove to be more convenient to work with. Note that\nthe implicit function theorem says that each function in H1 sufficiently close to\n10\n\n\fa translate of the soliton could be written as a translated soliton with slightly\ndifferent parameters plus a remainder in the subspace of H1 orthogonal in L2\nto \u03c6c0 and \u2202x \u03c6c0 . Therefore the exit in terms of the H1 norm is the exit of a\nproper open subset.\nLet us first revisit the upper bound given in [5] and prove that the upper\nbound is indeed exponential. The proof relies on exponential tail estimates.\nWe denote by L\u22121,0 and L0,1 the spaces of bounded operators from H\u22121 to L2\n(respectively from L2 to H1 ).\nProposition 3.1 For T > 0 and 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b10 fixed, there exists a constant\nC(\u03b1, c0 ), depending on \u03b1 and c0 but not on T , and \u01eb0 > 0 with \u01eb20 T sufficiently\nsmall depending on k\u03a6kL0,1 and \u03b1, such that for every positive \u01eb < \u01eb0 ,\n2\n\nP (\u03c4\u03b1\u01eb\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nC(\u03b1, c0 )\n\u2264 T ) \u2264 exp \u2212 2\n.\n\u01eb T k\u03a6k2L0,1\n\n(3.1)\n\nProof.

Let us denote by U\u03b10 the open set\n\b\nU\u03b10 = \u03c6c (* \u2212 y) + g, g \u2208 H1 : kgkH1 < \u03b10 , y \u2208 R, |c \u2212 c0 | < \u03b10 .\n\nWe know from [5] that the velocity is obtained via a continuous mapping C from\nU\u03b10 to R such that\nc\u01eb (t) = C (un,\u01eb,\u03c6c0 (t)) .\n\nAlso for fixed n, we write that for 0 < 2\u03b1 < \u03b10 ,\n\nP (\u03c4\u03b1n,\u01eb \u2264 T ) \u2265 P (un,\u01eb,\u03c6c0 \u2208 B)\nwhere\n\b\nB = u \u2208 C([0, T ]; H1 ) : \u2200t \u2208 [0, T ], u(t) \u2208 U\u03b10 , |C (u(T )) \u2212 c0 | > \u03b1 .\n\nTheorem 2.1 then leads to the following lower bound for lim\u01eb\u21920 \u01eb log P (\u03c4\u03b1n,\u01eb \u2264 T ):\no\nn\n1\n\u2212 inf khk2L2 (0,T ;L2 ) , h : \u2200t \u2208 [0, T ], Sn,\u03c6c0 (h)(t) \u2208 U\u03b10 , |C (Sn,\u03c6c0 (h)(T )) \u2212 c0 | > \u03b1 .\n2\n(3.5)\n14\n\n\fLet us, as in the proof of Proposition 2.2, replace in a first step the above\nvariational problem by a variational problem for \u03a6 = \u03a6H = (I \u2212 \u2206)\u22121/2 and \u03b1\nby 2\u03b1. Minimizing on a smaller set, we obtain\no\nn\n\u0001\n1\n\u2212 inf khk2L2 (0,T ;L2 ) , h : \u2200t \u2208 [0, T ], SH,\u03c6c0 (h)(t) \u2208 U\u03b10 , C SH,\u03c6c0 (h)(T ) \u2212 c0 = 3\u03b1 .\n2\nWe minimize on an even smaller set, considering solutions of the controlled\nequation which are modulated solitons of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ t\n\u03c6c(t) x \u2212\nc(s)\n0\n\nwhere the one dimensional paths c are assumed to belong to C1 ([0, T ]; (0, +\u221e)).\nThe boundary conditions are thus that c(0) = c0 and c(T ) = c0 + 2\u03b1. A control\nhc associated to such a solution is given by\n\u0001\u0001\nH,\u03c6c0\nhc (t, x) = \u03a6\u22121\n(hc ) + \u2202x3 SH,\u03c6c0 (hc ) + \u2202x SH,\u03c6c0 (hc )2 (t, x)\nH \u2202t S\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ t\nx\n\u2212\nc(s)ds\n.\n= c\u2032 (t) \u03a6\u22121\n\u2202\n\u03c6\nH c c c=c(t)\n0\n\nNote that this control is the same as in Proposition 2.2, only the terminal\nboundary condition changes.

Our aim is to\nfind the optimal paths c among the set of constrained paths minimizing the\npath integral. The integral may be written, with the same function g as in\nProposition 2.2, as\nZ T\n2\n(c\u2032 (t)) g (c(t)) dt.\n0\n\nUsing successively the change of variables t = T u and the change of unknown\nfunction v(u) = c(T u), we obtain an upper bound of the form\n1\nT\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(v \u2032 (u)) g(v(u))du\n\n0\n\nfor functions v which are C1 ([0, T ]; (0, +\u221e)) and satisfy the two boundary conditions v(0) = c0 and v(1) = c0 + 2\u03b1 independent of T . We recall that\ng(c) = k(I \u2212 \u2206)1/2 \u2202c \u03c6c k2L2 so that s 7\u2192 g(v(s)) is bounded on [0, 1] for any\nv \u2208 C1 ([0, T ]; (0, +\u221e)). Hence we deduce that the infimum in (3.6) is bounded\n0)\nabove by C(\u03b1,c\n. Now, coming back to the case where \u03a6n is the square root\nT\nof the covariance operator of the noise, we start from a path c obtained from v\n15\n\n\fwhich say minimizes the objective function in the above problem of the calculus\nof variations, though following the above argument it does not really matter.\nThen, the control hc is such that\n\u0001\nC SH,\u03c6c0 (hc )(T ) = c0 + 2\u03b1.\n\nFrom the continuity of the mild-solution of the control map with respect to the\nconvolution of the semi-group with the control, used to prove the LDP, and the\ncontinuity of this last quantity with respect to the control, and using also the\ncontinuity of C with respect to u \u2208 U\u03b10 , we know that for sufficiently large n\nC (Sn,\u03c6c0 (hc )(T ))\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\n= C SH,\u03c6c0 (I \u2212 \u2206)1/2 (I \u2212 \u2206 + (x2 I \u2212 \u2206)k )\u22121/2 hc (T )\nn\n> \u03b1.\n\nWe deduce that the inf-limit as n goes to infinity of the infimum in (3.5) is again\n0)\nand this ends the proof of Proposition 3.4.\n\u0003\nbounded above by C(\u03b1,c\nT\nAs a consequence of our two bounds, the typical time scale on which the\nsolution remains in the neighborhood of the modulated soliton is indeed 1/\u01eb2.\nAcknowledgments.
