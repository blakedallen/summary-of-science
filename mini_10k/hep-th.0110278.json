Introduction\nThe use of path integrals for the analysis of the bound-state and scattering sectors\nin quantum mechanics has significantly advanced in the past three decades.1,2,3\nHowever, much work remains to be done, a situation that is particularly evident for\nthe case of singular potentials.4 Among these, the contact interactions5,6,7 and the\ninverse square potential8,9 stand out; these problems have been the subject of active research in the past few years, mainly through the direct use of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation combined with appropriate regularization and renormalization analyses \u00e0\nla field theory.10,11,12,13,14,15,16 Recently we have started a program centered on the\nuse of path integrals for a systematic study of bound states and of the connection\nbetween field theory and quantum mechanics.17,18 We expect that our approach\nmay shed light on the formidable problem posed by bound states in quantum field\ntheory.19 In addition to introducing a technique of infinite summations of perturbation theory, we have specifically found analytic solutions for the two most outstanding singular interactions: the inverse square potential17 and the two-dimensional\ndelta-function interaction.18\nIn this paper we now investigate the quantum-mechanical properties of the inverse square potential from a complementary viewpoint, using an intrinsically non\u2217E-mail:\n\u2020 E-mail:\n\ncamblong@usfca.edu\nordonez@uh.edu\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nRegularized Green's Function/Inverse Square Potential\n\nperturbative operator approach. This is accomplished by directly considering the\nproblem associated with the energy Green's function G(E), defined as the Fourier\ntransform of the path-integral propagator K(T ) [multiplied by the Heaviside function \u03b8(T )]. The Green's function is then computed by solving a Sturm-Liouville\nproblem in real space.20,21,22 Our final results are in complete agreement with\nthe ones we obtained earlier by means of a path-integral perturbative approach.17\nMore precisely, we explicitly show that both approaches reproduce identical energy\nGreen's functions.\nThe relevance of this computation is highlighted by its recent application to a\nsimple realization of a quantum anomaly in Nature: the interaction of an electron\nwith a polar molecule.23 As shown in Ref. 23, the scale symmetry properties of the\ninverse square potential are inherited by the full-fledged dipole potential describing\nthe physics of this system-electron binding occurs for a sufficiently strong coupling\n(dipole moment) and this amounts to quantum mechanical symmetry breaking. Our\ncalculations in this paper provide additional support for this remarkable and unusual\nresult. This mechanism is further analyzed in Sec. 4.\n2. General Framework\nThe path-integral treatment for a D-dimensional nonrelativistic particle is based on\nthe quantum-mechanical propagator\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nKD (r , r ; t , t ) = lim\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n\u0012\n\nM\n2\u03c0i\u01eb~\n\n\u0013DN/2 \"NY\n\u22121 Z\nk=1\n\nD\n\nd rk\n\nRD\n\n#\n\neiS\n\n(N )\n\n/~\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nEquation (1) has been explicitly formulated in Cartesian coordinates by means\nof a time lattice tj = t\u2032 + j\u01eb [where \u01eb = (t\u2032\u2032 \u2212 t\u2032 )/N , with j = 0, * * * , N , while\nt0 \u2261 t\u2032 and tN \u2261 t\u2032\u2032 ], such that rj = r(tj ), with the end points being r0 \u2261 r\u2032 and\nP \u22121 (N )\n, with\nrN \u2261 r\u2032\u2032 .

For this all-important case,\nthe energy Green's function is then defined as a Fourier transform of the Green's\nfunction obtained from (1)-(2) by multiplication with the Heaviside function \u03b8(T ),\ni.e.,\nZ\n1 \u221e\ndT eiET /~ KD (r\u2032\u2032 , r\u2032 ; t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) .\n(3)\nGD (r\u2032\u2032 , r\u2032 ; E) =\ni~ 0\n\n\fRegularized Green's Function/Inverse Square Potential\n\n3\n\nEquations (2) and (3) establish the operator form of the energy Green's function in\nits configuration-space representation, which explicitly becomes\n\u001c \u0010\n\u0011\u22121 \u001d\nGD (r\u2032\u2032 , r\u2032 ; E) = r\u2032\u2032 E \u2212 \u0124 + i\u01eb\n(4)\nr\u2032 ,\nwhere i\u01eb = i0+ is a small imaginary part.

Likewise we define a rescaled radial Green's\nfunction Gl+\u03bd (r\u2032\u2032 , r\u2032 ; E) from the expansion of GD (r\u2032\u2032 , r\u2032 ; E), just as in (7)-or alternatively, by directly enforcing the analogue of Eq.

(8) requires specific knowledge of the potential and has to be dealt\nwith on a case-by-case basis. We now turn our attention to the advertised problem:\nthe inverse square potential.\n3. Green's Function for the Inverse Square Potential\nFor the case of an inverse square potential, we conveniently write\nV (r) = \u2212\n\n~2 \u03bb\n,\n2M r2\n\n(12)\n\nso that\n\"\n\n#\n2\n(l + \u03bd) \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1/4\nd2\nGl+\u03bd (r\u2032\u2032 , r\u2032 ; E) = \u03b4(r\u2032\u2032 \u2212 r\u2032 ) .\n+\u03b7\u2212\ndr\u20322\nr\u20322\n\n(13)\n\nAs a particular case of the Sturm-Liouville problem (9), Eq.

Equation (14) is immediately\nrecognized to have solutions of the generic form28\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(15)\nul,\u03bd (r) = r Zsl ( \u03b7 r) ,\nwhere Zsl (z) represents an appropriate linear combination of Bessel functions of\norder\nq\n(\u2217)\nsl = \u03bbl \u2212 \u03bb ,\n(16)\n\n\fRegularized Green's Function/Inverse Square Potential\n\n5\n\nwith\n(\u2217)\n\n\u03bbl\n\n2\n\n= (l + \u03bd) .\n\n(17)\n\nSimple inspection of Eqs. (13) and (14) shows that the only effect of adding an\ninverse square potential V (r) = \u2212~2 \u03bb/2M r2 to a free particle is a shift in the\nangular momentum quantum number,\np\nl + \u03bd \u2192 sl = (l + \u03bd)2 \u2212 \u03bb .\n(18)\n(\u2217)\n\nThis analysis shows that \u03bbl in Eq. (17) plays the role of a critical coupling, i.e.,\n(\u2217)\nthe nature of the solutions changes abruptly around the value \u03bb = \u03bbl , for any\n(\u2217)\nstate with angular momentum l.15 Thus, \u03bbl represents the threshold separating\nthe two coupling-strength regimes:\n(\u2217)\n\n\u2022 subcritical or weak coupling, \u03bb < \u03bbl (i.e., real sl );\n(\u2217)\n\u2022 supercritical or strong coupling, \u03bb > \u03bbl (i.e., imaginary sl ).\nIn the latter case the order can be rewritten as sl = i\u0398l , with a real parameter\nq\n(\u2217)\n\u0398l = \u03bb \u2212 \u03bbl .\n(19)\n\nClassification of the nature of the solutions can be fully accomplished by also considering the values of the energy E = ~2 \u03b7/2M :\n(i) scattering states amount to \u03b7 = k 2 > 0, for which the Bessel functions in\nEq. (15) have real argument kr;\n(ii) bound states amount to \u03b7 = \u2212\u03ba2 < 0, for which the Bessel functions have\nimaginary argument kr = i\u03bar.\nAs a result, the solutions (15) fall into one of the following four families:\n(i) subcritical bound-state sector:\n\u221a\nul,\u03bd (r)/ r = {Isl (\u03bar), Ksl (\u03bar) } ;\n(ii) subcritical scattering sector\n\u221a\nul,\u03bd (r)/ r = {Hs(1)\n(kr), Hs(2)\n(kr) } ;\nl\nl\n(iii) supercritical bound-state sector:\n\u221a\nul,\u03bd (r)/ r = {Ii\u0398l (\u03bar), Ki\u0398l (\u03bar) } ;\n(iv) supercritical scattering sector:\n\u221a\n(1)\n(2)\nul,\u03bd (r)/ r = {Hi\u0398l (kr), Hi\u0398l (kr) } .\n\n\f6\n\nRegularized Green's Function/Inverse Square Potential\n(1,2)\n\nHere the symbol {,} represents a linear combination and Hsl (z) stand for the\nHankel functions of the first and second kinds, whereas Isl (z) and Ksl (z) stand for\nthe modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds, respectively.28\nThe analysis of Ref. 15 applies almost verbatim to the Green's function formulation, with the result that regularization is only needed in the supercritical coupling\nregime. However, in this paper-just as in Refs. 12 and 13-we regularize the inverse square potential by introducing a real-space regulator a, a procedure that\nis different from the dimensional regularization of Ref. 15. The introduction of a\nregulator is necessary for strong coupling because the inverse square potential fails\nto provide a discriminating boundary condition at the origin.15 Thus, this singular behavior leads to the emergence of a scale-a behavior known as dimensional\ntransmutation.29 In some sense, the key to a successful regularization procedure is\nthe restoration of a sensible boundary condition at the origin. In particular, a realspace regulator allows one to restore the usual homogeneous boundary condition,\nbut now displaced away from the origin to a radial position r = a. In short, the\nboundary conditions satisfied by the Green's function are:\n\u2022 boundary condition at infinity,\n(r\u2192\u221e)\n\n(>)\n\nul,\u03bd (r) \u2212\u2192 0 ;\n\n(20)\n\n\u2022 boundary condition at r = a,\n(<)\n\nul,\u03bd (a) = 0 .\n\n(21)\n\nIn what follows and as anticipated for the supercritical regime, sl = i\u0398l , with \u0398l real\nand given by Eq. (19). From the behavior of Bessel functions30 and the boundary\nconditions, one concludes that, for the bound-state sector of the theory,\n(<)\n\nul,\u03bd (r) \u221d\n\n\u221a\nr [Ksl (\u03baa)Isl (\u03bar) \u2212 Isl (\u03baa)Ksl (\u03bar)]\n\n(22)\n\n[which satisfies condition (21)] and\n(>)\n\nul,\u03bd (r) \u221d\n\n\u221a\nr Ksl (\u03bar)\n\n(23)\n\n[which satisfies condition (20)]. In addition, from the well-known properties of\nthe Sturm-Liouville equation, the Wronskian of any two Bessel functions Z(z) is\nproportional to 1/z; for the problem at hand, it suffices to know (for example, from\nthe small-argument behavior of the Bessel functions) that W {Ks (z), Is (z)} = 1/z.28\nThen, Eq. (8) yields straightforwardly the desired regularized radial energy Green's\nfunction\nGl+\u03bd ( r\u2032\u2032 , r\u2032 ; E| \u03bb; a) =\n\u00d7\n\n2M \u221a \u2032 \u2032\u2032 Ki\u0398l (\u03bar> )\nrr\n~2\nKi\u0398l (\u03baa)\n[Ki\u0398l (\u03baa)Ii\u0398l (\u03bar< ) \u2212 Ii\u0398l (\u03baa)Ki\u0398l (\u03bar< )] ,\n\n\u2212\n\n(24)\n\n\fRegularized Green's Function/Inverse Square Potential\n\n7\n\n\u221a\nwith \u03ba = \u22122M E/~.\nAnalysis of the scattering sector requires an analytic continuation to positive\nenergies, with a replacement of the Bessel functions in Eq.

Indeed, Eq. (24) is identical to the corresponding formula recently found\nin Ref. 17. This completes the proof of the equivalence between the perturbative\nmethod of Ref. 17 and the nonperturbative approach of this paper.\n4. Renormalization, Anomalies, and Conclusions\nThe analysis that follows from Eq. (24) is identical to that of Ref. 17, which we\nsummarize here for completeness. The bound-state sector of the theory is determined by the poles of Eq. (24), which provide the implicit solutions of the equation\nKsl (\u03baa) = 0. This equation provides no bound states in the subcritical regime,\nbut the imaginary index sl = i\u0398l changes the nature of the Bessel function and\nleads to bound states in the supercritical regime. Then, as a is just a real-space\nregulator, attention needs to be focused only upon the limiting behavior for small a;\n2\nconsequently, the energy levels become Enr l = \u2212 (2 e\u2212\u03b3 /a) exp (\u22122\u03c0nr /\u0398l ) (with\nn = nr being the radial quantum number). This result, properly renormalized [with\n\u0398l = \u0398l (a) in the limit a \u2192 0], reproduces the known solution of the path-integral\napproach17 and of the Hamiltonian operator approach.12,13,15\nA remarkable property of this solution is the emergence of an arbitrary dimensional scale, within a theory that is devoid of dimensional scales at the level of the\nLagrangian-the phenomenon of dimensional transmutation.29\nAn even more illuminating approach to this scale problem is provided by a general analysis of symmetry of the action (but not necessarily the Lagrangian) under\ntime reparametrizations.32,33,34,35 Invariance of the action leads to the selection of\nthe SO(2,1) conformal group, as for the inverse square potential,33 the magnetic\nmonopole,34 and the magnetic vortex.35 The corresponding generators are:\n(i) the Hamiltonian H, associated with time translations t \u2192 t \u2212 \u03b1;\n(ii) the dilation generator\nD = tH \u2212\n\n1\n(r * p + p * r) ,\n4\n\n(26)\n\n\f8\n\nRegularized Green's Function/Inverse Square Potential\n\nassociated with a scale transformation t \u2192 \u03c4 t; r \u2192 \u03c4 1/2 r;\n(iii) the special conformal generator\n1\n1\nK = Ht2 \u2212 (p * r + r * p) t + mr2 ,\n2\n2\n\n(27)\n\nassociated with the special conformal transformation with respect to time\n1/t \u2192 1/t + \u03b1.\nThese three generators satisfy the commutator relations: [D, H] = \u2212i~H, [D, K] =\ni~K, and [H, K] = 2i~D, which show that they form an SO(2,1) algebra. The\nsame algebra is displayed by the two-dimensional delta-function interaction.10,18\nThe anomalous version of this algebra as a consequence of the breakdown of the\nclassical SO(2,1) symmetry is currently being investigated and will be reported\nelsewhere.\nThis quantum symmetry breaking of SO(2,1) invariance is exhibited in Nature at the level of molecular physics, where it is realized in the point-dipole\napproximation.23 In particular, the interaction between an electron and a polar\nmolecule can be reduced to a radial problem with an inverse square potential, for\nwhich the analysis of this paper applies. This information is then transferred to the\nangular part of the problem, which provides a critical dipole moment for electron\ncapture and formation of anions-a result of unusual relevance and which is confirmed by a large body of existing experimental and numerical evidence.36,37 This\nis indeed the most remarkable example of a quantum anomaly.23\nIn summary, we have completed a derivation of the energy Green's function for\nthe regularized inverse square potential (using a regularization \u00e0 la field theory)\nin the (strong) supercritical regime. This problem provides an example illustrating\nthat the use of intrinsically nonperturbative techniques (operator Green's function\napproach) yields results identical to the corresponding ones derived from the infinite\nsummation of perturbation theory to all orders.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Profs.
