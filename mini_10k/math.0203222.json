A peak at height k on a Dyck path is a point on\nthe path with coordinate y = k that is immediately preceded by a (1, 1) step and immediately\nfollowed by a (1, \u22121) step. In this paper we find an explicit expression for the generating\nfunction for the number of Dyck paths starting at (0, 0) and ending at (2n, 0) with exactly r\npeaks at height k. This allows us to express this function via Chebyshev polynomials of the\nsecond kind and the generating function for the Catalan numbers.\nKeywords: Dyck paths, Catalan numbers, Chebyshev polynomials.\n1. Introduction and main results\nThe Catalan sequence is the sequence\n\nwhere Cn =\n\n1\nn+1\n\n\u0001\n2n\nn\n\n{Cn }n\u22650 = {1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 132, 429, 1430, . . . },\nis called the nth Catalan number. The generating function for the\n\u221a\n\nCatalan numbers is denoted by C(x) = 1\u2212 2x1\u22124x . The Catalan numbers provide a complete\nanswer to the problem of counting certain properties of more than 66 different combinatorial\nstructures (see Stanley [S, Page 219 and Exercise 6.19]). The structure of use to us in the\npresent paper is Dyck paths.\n\nFigure 1. Two Dyck paths.\n\n1\n\n\fToufik Mansour\n\n2\n\nChebyshev polynomials of the second kind are defined by\nsin(r + 1)\u03b8\nsin \u03b8\nfor r \u2265 0. Evidently, Ur (x) is a polynomial of degree r in x with integer coefficients. Chebyshev polynomials were invented for the needs of approximation theory, but are also widely\nused in various other branches of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, number\ntheory, and lattice paths (see [K, Ri]). For k \u2265 0 we define Rk (x) by\n\u0011\n\u0010\nUk\u22121 2\u221a1 x\n\u0010\n\u0011.\nRk (x) = \u221a\nxUk 2\u221a1 x\nUr (cos \u03b8) =\n\nFor example, R0 (x) = 0, R1 (x) = 1, and R2 (x) = 1/(1 \u2212 x). It is easy to see that for any k,\nRk (x) is a rational function in x.\nA Dyck path is a lattice path in the plane integer lattice Z \u00d7 Z consisting of up-steps (1, 1)\nand down-steps (1, \u22121), which never passes below the x-axis (see Figure 1). Let P be a Dyck\npath; we define the weight of P to be the product\n\u221a of the weights of all its steps, where the\nweight of every step (up-step or down-step) is x. For example, Figure 1 presents two Dyck\npaths, each of length 12 and weight x6 .\nA point on the Dyck path is called a peak at height k if it is a point with coordinate y = k\nthat is immediately preceded by a up-step and immediately followed by a down-step. For\nexample, Figure 1 presents two Dyck paths; the path on the left has two peaks at height 2\nand two peaks at height 3; and the path on the right has one peak at height 1, one peak at\nheight 2, and one peak at height 3. A point on the Dyck path is called a valley at height k if it\nis a point with coordinate y = k that is immediately preceded by down-step and immediately\nfollowed by up-step. For example, in Figure 1, the path on the left has two valleys at height\n1 and one valley at height 2, and the path on the right has only two valleys at height 0. The\nnumber of all Dyck paths starting at (0, 0) and ending at (2n, 0) with exactly r peaks (resp.\nvalleys) at height k we denote by peakrk (n) (resp. valleyrk (n)). The corresponding generating\nfunction is denoted by Peakrk (x) (resp. Valley rk (x)).\nDeutsch [D] found the number of Dyck paths of length 2n starting and ending on the xaxis with no peaks at height 1 is given by the nth Fine number: 1, 0, 1, 2, 6, 18, 57, . . .\n(see [D, DS, F] and [SP, Sequence M1624]). Recently, Peart and Woan [PW] gave a complete\nanswer for the number of Dyck paths of length 2n starting and ending on the x-axis with no\npeaks at height k. This result can be formulated as follows.\nTheorem 1.1. (see [PW, Section 2]) The generating function for the number of Dyck paths\nof length 2n starting and ending on the x-axis with no peaks at height k is given by\n1\n1\u2212\n\n,\n\nx\nx\n\n1\u2212\n\n..\n1\u2212\n\n1\u2212\n\n.\nx\n\n1\u2212\n\nx2 C 2 (x)\n\nwhere the continued fraction contains exactly k levels.\n\n\fCounting peaks at height k in a Dyck path\n\n3\n\nTheorem 1.1 is in fact a simple consequence of Theorem 1.2 (as we are going to show in\nSection 3).\nTheorem 1.2. (see [RV, Proposition 1]) For given a Dyck path P we give every up-step the\nweight 1, every down-step from height k to height k \u2212 1 not following a peak the weight \u03bbk ,\nand every down-step following a peak of height k the weight \u03bck . The weight of w(P\nP ) of the\npath P is the product of the weights of its steps. Then the generating function P w(P ),\nwhere the sum over all the Dyck paths, is given by\n1\n1 \u2212 (\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bb1 ) \u2212\n\n\u03bb1\n1 \u2212 (\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03bb2 ) \u2212\n\n\u03bb2\n.\n1 \u2212 (\u03bc3 \u2212 \u03bb3 ) \u2212 . .\n\nIn this paper we find an explicit formulas for the generating functions Peakrk (x) and Valley rk (x)\nfor any k, r \u2265 0. This allows us to express these functions via Chebyshev polynomials of the\nsecond kind Uk (x) and generating function for the Catalan numbers C(x). The main result\nof this paper can be formulated as follows:\nMain Theorem 1.1.\n(i) For all k \u2265 2,\n\nPeakrk (x) = Valley rk\u22122 (x);\n\n(ii) For all k, r \u2265 0,\nValley rk (x) = \u03b4r,0 Rk+1 (x) +\n\nxr C r+1 (x)\n\n2\nUk+1\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n\u221a\n2 x\n\n(iii) For all r \u2265 0,\nPeakr1 (x) = \u03b4r,0 +\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n\u0011r+1 ;\n1 \u2212 x(Rk+1 (x) \u2212 1)C(x)\n\nx3r+2 C 2r+2 (x)\n.\n(1 \u2212 x2 C 2 (x))r+1\n\nWe give two proofs of this result. The first proof, given in Section 2, uses a decomposition of\nthe paths under consideration, while the second proof, given in Section 3, uses the continued\nfraction theorem due to Roblet and Viennot (see Theorem 1.2) as the starting point.\nRemark 1.3. By the first part and the second part of the Main Theorem, we obtain an\nexplicit expression for the generating function for the number of Dyck paths starting at (0, 0)\nand ending on the x-axis with no peaks at height k \u2265 2, namely\nPeak0k (x) = Rk\u22121 (x) +\n\nxr C r+1 (x)\n\n2\nUk\u22121\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n\u221a\n2 x\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n\u0011r+1 .\n1 \u2212 x(Rk\u22121 (x) \u2212 1)C(x)\n\nWe also provide a combinatorial explanation for certain facts in Main Theorem. For example,\nwe provide a combinatorial proof for the fact (ii) in the Main Theorem for r = k = 0.\nAcknowledgments. The author expresses his appreciation to the referees for their careful\nreading of the manuscript and helpful suggestions.\n\n\f4\n\nToufik Mansour\n2. Proofs: directly from definitions\n\nIn this section we present a proof for the Main Theorem which is based on the definitions of\nthe Dyck paths.\nProof of the Main Theorem(i). We start by proving the first part of the Main Theorem\nby introducing a bijection \u03a8 between the set of Dyck paths of length 2n with r peaks at\nheight k and the set of Dyck paths of length 2n with r valleys at height k \u2212 2.\n\nTheorem 2.1. Peakrk (x) = Valley rk\u22122 (x) for all k \u2265 2.\n\nProof. Let P = P1 , P2 , . . . , P2n be a Dyck path of length 2n with exactly r peaks at height\nk \u2265 2 where Pj are the points of the path P . For any point Pj we define another point\n\u03a8(Pj ) = Qj as follows. If Pj appears as a point of a valley at height k \u2212 2 then we define\nQj = Pj + (0, 2). If Pj appear as a point of a peak at height k then we define Qj = Pj \u2212 (0, 2)\n(this is possible since k \u2265 2). Otherwise, we define Qj = Pj . Therefore, we obtain a new\npath Q = Q1 , Q2 , . . . , Q2n , and by definition of Q it is easy to see that Q is a Dyck path of\nlength 2n with exactly r valleys at height k \u2212 2 (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Bijection \u03a8.\n\nIn fact, it is easily verified that the map which maps P to Q is a bijection. This establishes\nthe theorem.\nFormula for Valley 00 (x). Let P be a Dyck path with no valleys at height 0. It is easy to see\nthat P has no valleys at height 0 if and only if there exists a Dyck path P \u2032 of length 2n \u2212 2\nsuch that\nP = up-step, P \u2032 , down-step.\nLet P \u2032\u2032 be the path that results by shifting P \u2032 by (\u22121, \u22121). Then the map \u0398 which sends\nP \u2192 P \u2032\u2032 is a bijection between the set of all Dyck paths starting at (0, 0) and ending at\n(2n, 0) with no valleys, and the set of all Dyck paths starting at point (0, 0) and ending at\n(2n \u2212 2, 0). Hence\nValley 00 (x) = 1 + xC(x),\nwhere we count 1 for the empty path, x for the up-step and the down-step, and C(x) for all\nDyck paths P \u2032\u2032 .\n\n\fCounting peaks at height k in a Dyck path\n\n5\n\nProof of the Main Theorem(ii). First of all, let us present two facts. The first fact\nconcerns the generating function for the number of Dyck paths from the southwest corner of\na rectangle to the northeast corner.\nFact 2.2. (see [K, Theorem A2 with Fact A3]) Let k \u2265 0. The generating function for the\nnumber of Dyck paths which lie between the lines y = k and y = 0, starting at (0, 0) and\nending at (n, k) is given by\n1\n\u0010\n\u0011.\nFk (x) := \u221a\nxUk+1 2\u221a1 x\nThe second fact concerns the generating function for the number of Dyck paths starting at\n(a, k + 1) and ending at (a + n, k + 1) with no valleys at height k.\nFact 2.3. The generating function for the number of Dyck paths starting at (a, k + 1) and\nending at (a + n, k + 1) with no valleys at height k is given by\nC(x)\n.\n1 \u2212 x(Rk+1 (x) \u2212 1)C(x)\nProof. Let P be a Dyck path starting at (k + 1, 0) and ending at (k + 1, n) with no valleys\nat height k. It is easy to see that P has a unique decomposition of the form\nP = W1 , down-step, V1 , up-step, W2 , down-step, V2 , . . . , up-step, Wm ,\nwhere the following conditions holds for all j:\n(i) Wj is a path consisting of up-steps and down-steps starting and ending at height k + 1\nand never passes below the height k + 1;\n(ii) Vj is a path consisting of up-step and down-steps starting and ending at height k and\nnever passes over the height k (see Figure 3).\n\nDyck path\n\nDyck path\n\nDyck path\n\nend\n\nstart\n\nHeight k+1\nHeight k\n\nDyck path\n\nX-axis\n\nDyck path\n\nHeight 0\n\nFigure 3. A decomposition of a Dyck path starting at (a, k + 1) and ending\nat (a + n, k + 1) with no valleys at height k.\n\n\fToufik Mansour\n\n6\n\nUsing [K, Theorem 2] we get that the generating function for the number of paths of type Vj\n(shift for a Dyck path) is given by Rk+1 (x) \u2212 1. Using the fact that Wj is a shift for a Dyck\npaths starting and ending on the x-axis we obtain the generating function for the number of\nDyck paths of type Wj is given by C(x). If we sum over all the possibilities of m then we\nhave\nX\n\u0001m\nC(x)\n.\nxC(x)(Rk+1 (x) \u2212 1) =\nC(x)\n1 \u2212 x(Rk+1 (x) \u2212 1)C(x)\nm\u22650\n\nNow we are ready to prove the second part of the Main Theorem.\nTheorem 2.4. The generating function Valley rk (x) is given by\n\u03b4r,0 Rk+1 (x) +\n2\nUk+1\n\n\u0010\n\nxr C r+1 (x)\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011r+1 .\n1\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212\nx(R\n(x)\n\u2212\n1)C(x)\nk+1\n2 x\n\nProof. Let P be a Dyck path starting (0, 0) and ending at (2n, 0) with exactly r valleys at\nheight k. It is easy to see that P has a unique decomposition of the form\nP = E1 , up-step, D0 , down-step, up-step, D1 , down-step, up-step, . . . , Dr , down-step, E2 ,\nwhere the following conditions holds:\n(i) E1 is a Dyck path that lies between the lines y = k and y = 0, starting at (0, 0), and\nending at point on height k;\n(ii) Dj is a Dyck path starting and ending at points on height k + 1 without valleys at\nheight k, for all j;\n(iii) E2 is a Dyck path that lies between the lines y = k and y = 0, starting at point on\nheight k, and ending at (2n, 0).\nUsing Fact 2.2 and Fact 2.3 we get the the desired result for all r \u2265 1. Now, if we assume\nthat r = 0, then we must consider another possibility which is that all the Dyck paths lie\nbetween the lines y = k and y = 0, starting at (0, 0), and ending on the x-axis. Hence, using\n[K, Theorem 2] we get that the generating function for the number of these paths is given by\nRk+1 (x).\nAs a corollary of the Main Theorem(ii) for k = 0 (using [M, Example 1.18]) we get\nTheorem 2.5. For all r \u2265 0,\n\nValley r0 (x) = \u03b4r,0 + xr+1 C r+1 (x).\n\nIn other words, the number of Dyck paths starting at (0, 0) and ending at (2n, 0) with exactly\nr valleys at height 0 is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr + 1 2n \u2212 r \u2212 1\n.\nn\nn+1\nProof of the Main Theorem(iii). If we merge the first two parts of Main Theorem, then\nwe get an explicit formula for Peakrk (x) for all r \u2265 0 and k \u2265 2. Besides, by definition there\nare no peaks at height 0. Thus, it is left to find Peakr1 (x) for all r \u2265 0.\n\n\fCounting peaks at height k in a Dyck path\nTheorem 2.6. For all r \u2265 0,\nPeakr1 (x) = \u03b4r,0 +\n\n7\n\nx3r+2 C 2r+2 (x)\n.\n(1 \u2212 x2 C 2 (x))r+1\n\nProof. Let P be a Dyck path starting at (0, 0) and ending at (2n, 0) with exactly r peaks at\nheight 1. It is easy to see that P has a unique decomposition of the form\nP = D0 , up-step, down-step, D1 , up-step, down-step, . . . , up-step, down-step, Dr ,\nwhere Dj is a nonempty Dyck path starting and ending at point on the x-axis with no peaks\nat height 1. Hence, the rest is easy to obtain by using [D].\nFor example, for r = 0 the above theorem yields the main result of [D].\n3. Proofs: Directly from Theorem 1.2\nIn this section we present another proof for the Main Theorem which is based on Roblet and\nViennot [RV, Proposition 1] (see Theorem 1.2).\nLet \u03bbj = x for all j, \u03bcj = x for all j 6= k, and \u03bck = z. Theorem 1.2 yields\nX\n1\nPeakrk (x)z r =\n,\n(1)\nx\n1\u2212\nr\u22650\nx\n1\u2212\n..\n.\n1\u2212\nx\n1\u2212\nx\n1\u2212\nx\n1 \u2212 (z \u2212 x) \u2212\nx\n1\u2212\nx\n1\u2212\n.\n1 \u2212 ..\nwhere z appears in the kth level. On the other hand, xC 2 (x) = C(x) \u2212 1, we have that\n1\n.\n(2)\nC(x) =\nx\n1\u2212\nx\n1\u2212\n.\n1 \u2212 ..\nUsing the identities (1) and (2) with xC 2 (x) = C(x) \u2212 1 we get\nP\nTheorem 3.1. The generating function r\u22650 Peakrk (x)z r is given by\n1\n\n1\u2212\n\n,\n\nx\nx\n\n1\u2212\n\n..\n1\u2212\n\n1\u2212\n\n.\nx\n\n1\u2212\n\nx\n1 \u2212 z \u2212 x2 C 2 (x)\n\nwhere the continued fraction contains exactly k levels.\n\n\fToufik Mansour\n\n8\n\nFor example, Theorem 3.1 yields for z = 0 the generating function Peak0k (x) as in the statement of Theorem 1.1. More generally, Theorem 3.1 yields an explicit expression for Peakrk (x)\nfor any r \u2265 1 by using the following lemma.\nLemma 3.2. For all k \u2265 1,\n1\nx\n1\u2212\nx\n1\u2212\n1\u2212\n\n= Rk (x) *\n..\n\n1 \u2212 zRk\u22121 (x) \u2212 xARk\u22121 (x)\n.\n1 \u2212 zRk (x) \u2212 xARk (x)\n\n.\n\nx\n1 \u2212 z \u2212 xA\nwhere the continued fraction contains exactly k levels.\n1\u2212\n\nProof. Immediately, by using the identity Rm+1 (x) = 1/(1\u2212xRm (x)) and induction on k.\nTherefore, using Theorem 3.1, the above lemma, and the identity Rm+1 (x) = 1/(1\u2212xRm (x)),\ntogether with definitions of Rk (x), we get the explicit expression for the generating function\nPeakrk (x) for any r \u2265 1 (see the Main Theorem).\nReferences\n[D]\n[DS]\n[F]\n[K]\n[M]\n[PW]\n[RV]\n[Ri]\n[SP]\n[S]\n\nE.
