We mainly focus on (nonstandard) triplet-state pairing of neutrons with the |mJ | = 2\nprojection of the total angular momentum of Cooper pairs onto quantization axis. The specific\nfeature of this pairing is that it leads to a power-law (nonexponential) reduction of the emissivity\nof the main neutrino processes by neutron superfluidity. For a wide range of neutron critical\ntemperatures Tcn , the cooling of NSs with the |mJ | = 2 superfluidity is either the same as the\ncooling with the mJ = 0 superfluidity, considered in the majority of papers, or much faster. The\ncooling of NSs with density dependent critical temperatures Tcn (\u03c1) and Tcp (\u03c1) can be imitated\nby the cooling of the NSs with some effective critical temperatures Tcn and Tcp constant over NS\ncores. The hypothesis of strong neutron superfluidity with |mJ | = 2 is inconsistent with current\nobservations of thermal emission from NSs, but the hypothesis of weak neutron superfluidity of\nany type does not contradict to observations.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe cooling of neutron stars (NSs) strongly depends on the properties of the matter in their cores,\nprimarily on the equation of state for the matter (Lattimer and Prakash 2001) and on the critical\ntemperatures of NS nucleon superfluidity (Lombardo and Schulze 2001). At present, both are known\nincompletely, because there is no reliable microscopic theory. The available knowledge about the\nproperties of the matter in NS cores can be improved by comparing observational data with NS\ncooling models.\nHere, we consider some cooling models. For definiteness, we assume the standard composition\nof NS cores: neutrons (n), protons (p), and electrons (e).\nIt is well known that the neutrons and protons in NS cores can be in a superfluid state (Yakovlev\net al. 1999; Lombardo and Schulze 2001). Model calculations of superfluid gaps show that proton\npairing takes place in the singlet 1 S0 state of the proton pair. Neutron pairing can take place in\nthe singlet and triplet (3 P2 ) states; singlet pairing generally arises in matter of moderate density\n\u2217\n\ne-mail: gusakov@astro.ioffe.rssi.ru\n\n1\n\n\f2\n14\n\u22123\n(\u03c1<\n\u223c \u03c10 , where \u03c10 = 2.8 \u00d7 10 g cm is the nuclear density) and triplet pairing arises in denser\nmatter. The triplet pairing, in turn, can be of several types that differ by the component of the\ntotal moment of the nucleon pair along the quantization axis (|mJ | = 0, 1, 2). Following the review\narticles by Yakovlev et al. (1999, 2001), we call the singlet pairing case A, the triplet pairing with\n|mJ | = 0 case B, and the triplet pairing with |mJ | = 2 case C. Case C stands out among the\nremaining cases in that the superfluid gap in the dispersion relation for neutrons becomes zero at\nsome points of the Fermi surface (at its poles). This leads to a fundamentally different (powerlaw rather than exponential) dependence of the NS neutrino energy losses on the gap amplitude\n(Yakovlev et al. 1999). The type of superfluidity with a minimum free energy occurs in nature.\nThe A-type proton pairing in the NS core, the A-type neutron pairing in the crust and in the outer\ncore, and the B-type pairing in the inner core are commonly considered in cooling calculations.\nThe C-type neutron pairing in the NS core seems less realistic, but it is not ruled out by current\nmicroscopic theories.\nUp until now, virtually nobody has modeled the NS cooling with the C-type neutron superfluidity. We know only the recent paper by Schaab et al. (1998), who attempted to take into\naccount the effect of such pairing on the main processes of neutrino energy release in NS cores\nand on the NS cooling. Unfortunately, the authors failed to completely consider all of the factors\nthat determine the thermal evolution of NSs. Thus, for example, when considering one of the most\nimportant neutrino processes, the neutrino emission during Cooper neutron pairing, the authors\nused an exponential dependence instead of the correct power-law dependence of the rate of energy\nrelease on T /Tcn (Tcn is the critical neutron temperature).\nHere, we analyze the NS cooling for the C-type neutron pairing more rigorously. We compare\nthe coolings for the B- and C-type superfluidities. Our results are compared with observations.\n\n2\n\nNS cooling for the C-type neutron pairing\n\nFor the cooling to be adequately modeled, we must know the rate of neutrino energy release in\nsuperfluid NS interiors and the heat capacity of the NS matter. Recall that the main neutrino\nprocesses in NS cores are the direct Urca process, the modified Urca process, the nucleon-nucleon\nscattering reactions, and the Cooper pairing of nucleons. The first process, the most powerful\nmechanism of neutrino energy release, is a threshold process. The direct Urca process is open if\npFn \u2264 2pFp , where pFn and pFp are the neutron and proton Fermi momenta, respectively.\nThe neutrino processes and heat capacity for cases A, B, and C have been studied extensively.\nThe results can be found in the review article by Yakovlev et al. (2001) and in Gusakov (2002).\nYakovlev et al. (2001) considered the neutrino processes with the A- or B-type neutron and A-type\nproton superfluidities; they took into account the effect of the C-type superfluidity on the direct\nUrca process, the neutrino energy release during Cooper neutron pairing, and the neutron heat\ncapacity. Gusakov (2002) investigated the modified Urca process during the C-type pairing and\nthe nn- and np-scattering reactions. He also rigorously took into account the effect of the combined\nA- or B-type nucleon superfluidity on the modified Urca process.\nHere, we use the relativistic nonisothermal NS cooling code (see Yakovlev et al. 2001) adapted\nfor the model with the C-type neutron superfluidity. This code allows us to construct the cooling\ncurves, i.e., to determine the dependence of the surface temperature of a star, Te\u221e , (recorded\nby a remote observer with allowance made for the gravitational redshift) on its age, t. Following\nKaminker et al. (2002), we use the equation of state by Negele and Vautherin (1973) in the NS crust\nand the equation of state by Prakash et al. (1988) in the NS core with the compression modulus\nK = 240 MeV for symmetric nuclear matter at \u03c1 = \u03c10 (model I from their paper for the symmetry\nenergy). For this equation of state, the direct Urca process opens at \u03c1 \u2265 \u03c1D = 7.851 \u00d7 1014\n\n\f3\ng cm\u22123 , i.e., at M \u2265 1.358M\u2299 . In this case, the maximum NS mass is M = 1.977M\u2299 . In the\ncooling code used, the effective proton and neutron masses in the inner NS layers renormalized with\nallowance made for multiparticle effects were assumed to be 0.7 of the mass of the free particles.\nThe relationship between the NS surface and internal temperatures was taken from Potekhin et\nal. (1997).\nTo better understand at which critical nucleon temperatures the C-type neutron superfluidity\nin NS cores differs from case B, we mentally replace the NS under consideration by a sphere with\na radially constant density characteristic of this star. In that case, after the completion of thermal\nrelaxation and before the beginning of the photon NS cooling stage, the time derivative of the\ninternal NS temperature can be estimated as dT /dt \u223c \u2212Q/C, where Q is the energy released in\nthe form of neutrinos per unit volume per unit time and C is the heat capacity per unit volume.\nThis formula holds for both B- and C-type neutron superfluidities. Since the C-type superfluidity\nsuppresses the NS energy release more weakly and since the energy released via Cooper pairing is\nhigher than that in case B, we may say that QC > QB always. Similarly, CC > CB , therefore, it\nis not clear in advance which stars cool down faster: with the C- or B-type neutron superfluidity\nin the NS core. If we introduce the critical nucleon temperatures Tcn and Tcp for the characteristic\ndensity under consideration, then, depending on Tcn and Tcp , the function log[QC CB /(QB CC )] will\nbe convenient for understanding when the cooling for cases C and B proceeds almost identically\nand when the differences are at a maximum.\nLet us examine Fig. 1. It consists of six pictures, each corresponding to a certain temperature\n(T = 108 , 3 \u00d7 108 , or 109 K) and density (\u03c1 = 2\u03c10 , or 5\u03c10 ). The direct Urca process is forbidden\nat \u03c1 = 2\u03c10 and permitted at \u03c1 = 5\u03c10 . Our calculations show that when the temperatures and\ndensities are varied, the pictures do not change fundamentally until the threshold density \u03c1D at\nwhich the direct Urca process switches on (or off) is crossed. The logarithms of the critical proton\nand neutron temperatures at a fixed density are plotted along the vertical and horizontal axes of\neach picture, respectively. The critical nucleon temperatures lower than 107 K (weak superfluidity)\nhave virtually no effect on the NS cooling and, hence, are not considered. In the figure, the function\nlog[QC CB /(QB CC )] is indicated by different shades of gray. The shade of gray for the region of\ncritical temperatures to the left from the vertical dashed line (nonsuperfluid neutrons) corresponds\nto zero of this function. The darker is the shade of gray, the larger is log[QC CB /(QB CC )]. For\nexample, for T = 108 K, the maximum of this function reaches (6 \u2013 7) for critical proton and\nneutron temperatures Tcp,cn \u223c (109 \u2212 1010 ) K at \u03c1 = 2\u03c10 and (8 \u2013 9) for Tcp \u223c (107 \u2212 108 ) K,\nTcn \u223c 3 \u00d7 (109 \u2212 1010 ) K at \u03c1 = 5\u03c10 . Conversely, the lighter is the shade of gray relative to the\n'zero' shade, the smaller is the function. The region with the shade of gray lighter than the 'zero'\nshade is narrow and lies near Tcn \u223c 3T . In this region, the minimum value of the function is of\nthe order of \u20131 for both densities. A further increase in the internal NS temperature causes the\ndifferences between the B- and C-type neutron superfluidities to be smoothed out; the smoothing\noccurs faster for the densities at which the direct Urca process is open. Thus, for T = 109 K,\nthe maximum of log[QC CB /(QB CC )] is (3 \u2013 3.5) for \u03c1 = 2\u03c10 and (1 \u2013 1.2) for \u03c1 = 5\u03c10 , while its\nminimum is nearly zero for both densities. Summing up our results, we may say that the inequality\n(dT /dt)C \u2265 (dT /dt)B holds for any T , Tcn , Tcp , and \u03c1. Therefore, one can hardly expect the\nNS cooling curve for case C to pass well above the cooling curve for case B (at fixed Tcn and\nTcp ). Clearly, the reverse can be easily realized by an appropriate (see above) choice of critical\ntemperatures.\nLet us now turn directly to an examination of the NS cooling curves. For simplicity, the neutrons\nin the stellar crust are assumed to be nonsuperfluid. This assumption has no effect on the difference\nbetween the cooling curves for the B- and C-type neutron superfluidities in the NS core. Although\nthe critical nucleon temperatures Tcn (\u03c1) and Tcp (\u03c1) are actually functions of the density and vary\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 1: The function log[QC CB /(QB CC )] over a wide range of Tcn and Tcp is indicated by different\nshades of gray.

In this case, the cooling curves remain\nthe same as if we took into account the exact dependence Tcn (\u03c1) and Tcp (\u03c1) (e.g., for protons,\na constant effective temperature Tcp close to Tcp (\u03c1c ), where \u03c1c is the central density of the star,\nalways corresponds to the temperature profile Tcp (\u03c1)). Therefore, for simplicity, we assume the\ncritical nucleon temperatures to be density-independent.\nFigures 2 \u2013 5 show the cooling curves constructed for two NS masses: M = 1.35M\u2299 (Figs. 2 and\n3) and M = 1.44M\u2299 (Figs. 4 and 5). The direct Urca process is forbidden for M = 1.35M\u2299 and\npermitted for M = 1.44M\u2299 . In Table 1 we give the various critical nucleon temperatures Tcn and\nTcp for which the cooling curves were constructed. Each pair of critical temperatures in the table\nhas its own number. In Figs. 2 \u2013 6, the cooling curves are marked by these numbers. The letter B\nor C near the number specifies the type of neutron superfluidity. For example, 3C means that the\ncooling curve was constructed for the C-type neutron superfluidity for the critical temperatures\nTcn and Tcp under number 3. We see from analysis of Figs. 2 \u2013 5 that all our main conclusions\ndrawn from an examination of Fig. 1 are confirmed. For M = 1.35M\u2299 , the largest differences\nare observed for the 3B and 3C curves in Fig. 2 (high critical temperatures). At critical proton\ntemperatures Tcp \u223c 5 \u00d7 108 K, the neutrino emission during Cooper proton pairing is the most\n\n\f6\n\nFigure 3: Same as Fig. 2 but for another superfluidity models\n\npowerful process in the NS core. Accordingly, the differences between the cooling curves for cases B\nand C decrease. This can be verified by comparing the 4B and 4C curves in Fig. 3. As the critical\n8\n9\n10\nproton temperatures decrease to Tcp <\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10 K and for Tcn >\n\u223c 10 K (but Tcn <\n\u223c 10 K), the\n10\ndifferences again increase (the 2B and 2C curves in Fig. 2). When Tcn >\n\u223c 10 K and increases, the\ndifferences gradually decrease and the cooling curves for the B- and C-type neutron paring coincide\nfor Tcn \u223c 1011 K. At moderately high critical temperatures Tcn < 109 K, the curves for case B\nalmost coincide with those for case C (see, e.g., Fig. 3: 5B and 5C or 6B and 6C). The kink in\nthe 5B and 5C curves occurs at T = Tcn and stems from the fact that the neutrino emission due to\nCooper neutron pairing switches on. Note that the critical temperatures of the 6B and 6C curves\nexactly fall within the region where the temperature for the B-type neutron superfluidity decreases\nfaster than that for case C (log[QC CB /(QB CC )] < 0). This actually leads to the fact that the\n6B curve initially passes slightly below the 6C curve. Subsequently, as the internal temperature T\ndecreases, the situation is reversed, because we reach the regions with faster cooling for the C-type\nsuperfluidity (see Fig. 1).\nFor M = 1.44M\u2299 , the differences are largest for the 7B and 7C curves in Fig. 4, i.e., at\nhigh critical neutron temperatures and at low critical proton temperatures. As Tcn decreases, the\ndifferences between the cooling curves for the B- and C-type superfluidities gradually disappear\n(see Fig. 4: 8B and 8C; Fig. 5: 10B and 10C). The remaining remarks almost completely repeat\nthose for M = 1.35M\u2299 .\nOur results can be of use in explaining observational data. The NS cooling with weak Btype neutron superfluidity was considered by Kaminker et al. (2002). The authors showed that the\navailable observational data on the thermal radiation from eight isolated NSs could be explained by\n9\n8\nassuming strong proton (Tcp,max >\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 K) and weak neutron (Tcn,max <\n\u223c 10 K) superfluidities.\nIn this case, the critical temperatures Tcp and Tcn must depend on density \u03c1 [have a maximum\nat \u03c1 \u223c (2 \u2212 3)\u03c10 , as predicted by microscopic theories of superfluidity; see, e.g., Lombardo and\nSchulze (2001)]. The mechanisms of strong proton and weak neutron superfluidities are primarily\n\n\f7\n\nFigure 4: Same as Figs. 2 and 3 for M = 1.44M\u2299\n\nneeded to interpret the observations of two sources, RX J0822\u201343 (Zavlin et al. 1999) and PSR\n1055\u201352 (\u00d6gelman 1995), the hottest ones for their age. The observational data on these sources\nare shown in Fig. 6 [we took the same Te\u221e and t as those used by Kaminker et al. (2002)]. Until\nrecently, in addition to these two sources, yet another source, RX J185635\u20133754, must have been\nconsidered (Pons et al. 2002; Burwitz et al. 2001; G\u00e4nsicke et al. 2001; Kaplan et al. 2001).\nHowever, in the just published paper by Walter and Lattimer (2002), the age of RX J185635\u20133754\nwas revised (reduced by almost half) and is now estimated to be t \u2248 5\u00d7105 yr, which is attributable\nto a decrease in the distance to this source.\nWhen comparing observations with cooling models, we should take into account the fact that\nthe surface temperatures and ages of isolated cooling NSs are determined with a low accuracy [for\nthe reasons discussed, e.g., by Pavlov and Zavlin (1998) and Yakovlev et al. (1999)]. The NS age\nt is probably known to within a factor \u223c 2.\nSince the determination of Te\u221e and t is ambiguous, we can offer an interpretation of the observations alternative to that offered by Kaminker et al. (2002). More specifically, if we take the lowest\npossible values of Te\u221e and t for PSR 1055\u201352, then the observations of the eight NSs considered\nby Kaminker et al. (2002) can be interpreted by assuming strong neutron superfluidity and weak\nproton superfluidity in the stellar cores. Although this interpretation is less plausible than that\noffered by Kaminker et al. (2002) (according to microscopic calculations of Tcn (\u03c1) and Tcp (\u03c1), the\ntriplet neutron pairing is generally weaker than the single proton pairing), it cannot be ruled out in\nadvance and should be studied. It actually requires lower values of Te\u221e and t of the fairly old and\nhot source PSR 1055\u201352, because strong neutron superfluidity significantly reduces the NS heat\ncapacity and speeds up the NS cooling at the late photon cooling stage [implying that the models\nby Kaminker et al. (2002) can describe older and hotter sources].\nA detailed discussion of the hypothesis of strong neutron superfluidity and weak proton superfluidity in NS cores is beyond the scope of this paper and will be given in our subsequent publication.\nHere, we only illustrate the possibility of this interpretation of observations for the two hottest\n\n\f8\n\n9B\n\nFigure 5: Same as Figs. 2 and 3 for M = 1.44M\u2299\n\nsources (RX J0822\u201343 and PSR 1055-52) by using simplified models of cooling NSs with critical\ntemperatures Tcn (\u03c1) and Tcp (\u03c1) constant over the stellar core. The dotted lines in Fig. 6 represent\nthe cooling curves for Tcn = 5 \u00d7 109 K and Tcp = 107 K. For comparison, the dashed line was drawn\nfor strong proton superfluidity and weak neutron superfluidity (Tcp = 5 \u00d7 109 K, Tcn = 108 K). It\nvirtually coincides with the cooling curve obtained by Kaminker et al. (2002) to interpret the above\ntwo sources. We see that the upper dotted line (B-type neutron superfluidity) almost coincide with\n5\n5\nthe dashed line for t <\n\u223c 10 yr and passes slightly below the dashed line for t >\n\u223c 10 yr (because\nof the above suppression of the neutron heat capacity by strong neutron superfluidity). Nevertheless, given the inaccurate determination of Te\u221e and t, the upper dotted line could be assumed to\nsatisfactorily explain these two sources. At the same time, the lower dotted line for strong C-type\nneutron superfluidity passes well below (because of the weaker suppression of neutrino emission by\nthe C-type superfluidity) and cannot be considered to be acceptable. Therefore, the observations\ncan (with the above reservations) be explained by strong B-type neutron superfluidity but cannot\nbe explained by the C-type neutron superfluidity with the same Tcn = 5 \u00d7 109 K. With a further\nincrease in Tcn , the upper dotted line would not change at all (strong B-type neutron superfluidity\nwith Tcn \u223c 5 \u00d7 109 K almost completely switched off the neutrino reactions involving neutrons and\nmade the neutron heat capacity equal to zero), while the lower dotted line would slowly approach\nthe upper curve (the C-type neutron superfluidity increasingly suppresses the neutrino luminosity\nand heat capacity), reaching it at Tcn \u223c 1011 K. Thus, the interpretation of the observations in the\nmodel of strong C-type neutron superfluidity is possible in principle but is implausible, because it\nrequires unrealistically high values of Tcn \u223c 1011 K.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nThe cooling of NSs with C-type neutron superfluidity in their cores has been consistently studied\nfor the first time. The critical nucleon temperatures were assumed to be constant over the stellar\n\n\f9\n\n12B\n\nFigure 6: The cooling curves for the models with the B- and C-type neutron superfluidities in\nthe core of a NS with M = 1.35M\u2299 and observational data on the surface temperatures of two\nsources. The dashed curves are for Tcn = 108 K and Tcp = 5 \u00d7 109 K; the dotted curves are for\nTcn = 5 \u00d7 109 K and Tcp = 107 K.\n\ncore. A comparison with B-type neutron superfluidity was made. We found that the cooling curves\nfor case C can pass well below the cooling curves for case B (faster cooling). Otherwise, the curves\ndiffer only slightly. The cooling with variable (over the core) critical temperatures Tcn (\u03c1) and Tcp (\u03c1)\ncan generally be described by the cooling with some effective constant temperatures Tcn and Tcp .\nThe model with C-type neutron superfluidity can account for the observational data on the\n9\nthermal radiation from isolated NSs by assuming strong proton superfluidity (Tcp >\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 K)\n8\nand weak neutron superfluidity (Tcn <\n\u223c 10 K). The interpretation of the observations in terms of\n8\nthe model with strong neutron superfluidity and with weak proton superfluidity (Tcp <\n\u223c 10 K) is\nunlikely (in contrast to the same model for case B), because it requires too high critical neutron\ntemperatures, Tcn \u223c 1011 K. Our results can be useful in understanding which type of superfluidity\n(B or C) occurs in nature.\n\n4\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nOne of the authors (MEG) is grateful to D.G. Yakovlev and A.D.
