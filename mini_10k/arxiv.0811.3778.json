This paper reviews some of the ongoing studies by\nthese collaborations and, when possible, highlights the differences between equivalent channels in both experiments.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Higgs mechanism [1] is central to the Standard Model of particle physics (SM). The existence of the Higgs\nfield maintains the theory weakly interacting up to high energy scales and prevents some processes from violating\nunitarity. In the process of spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry, the weak bosons W \u00b1 and Z 0 , as well\nas leptons and quarks, acquire mass through interactions with the Higgs field. In the SM, the simplest form of the\nHiggs mechanism is assumed, which predicts the existence of a single scalar particle, the Higgs boson and a single\nfree parameter, its mass (mH ). The discovery of this particle would provide experimental evidence for the Higgs\nmechanism. The discovery and study of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking is one of the main goals\nof the ATLAS [2] and CMS [3] experiments, operating at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Many models of physics\nbeyond the SM predict a more complex Higgs sector, covered elsewhere [4].\nDirect searches for the Higgs boson produced in association with a Z 0 were performed in the Large Electron\nPositron collider (LEP). These resulted in the exclusion of the Higgs boson in the mass range up to 114.4 GeV at\n95% confidence level [5]. On the other hand, precision fits [6] of electroweak observables, including data from the LEP\nand Tevatron colliders, provide an indirect estimate of the Higgs boson mass, assuming the SM scenario. The latest\n2\nfit results give mH = 84+34\n\u221226 GeV/c , or the one-sided 95% confidence-level limit mH < 154 GeV. Including the LEP\ndirect search results, this limit increases to 185 GeV/c2 . Recent combined results from the Tevatron experiments\nhave, for the first time, excluded the hypothesis of a Higgs boson mass around 170 GeV [7] at 95% confidence level.\nAlthough the expected sensitivity of Tevatron experiments is not enough to make a 5\u03c3 discovery of the SM Higgs\nboson [8], it is enough to exclude it out up to mH \u223c 200 GeV/c2 at 95% confidence level, or to make a 3\u03c3 observation.\n\n2. Higgs boson searches in ATLAS and CMS\nThe Higgs boson production at the LHC is dominated by the gluon-gluon fusion process, described at leading order\nthrough a heavy-quark loop. The next-to-leading order cross section for this process is 37.6 pb, for mH = 120 GeV/c2 .\nThe Higgs boson can also be produced by Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) with a cross section of 4.25 pb, or by associated\nproduction with a W \u00b1 , a Z 0 , or a tt\u0304 quark pair, with 3.19 pb for the three processes and mH = 120 GeV/c2 (cross\nsections calculated at next-to-leading order using parton density function sets CTEQ6M and CTEQ6L1 [9]).\n2\nThe Higgs boson branching ratio is strongly dependent on its mass. At mH <\n\u223c 135 GeV/c , the main decay mode\n+ \u2212\nis to a bb\u0304 pair (BR = 81%), followed by the decay to a \u03c4 \u03c4 pair (BR \u223c 8%). For a small but important interval\nof mH , the Higgs boson decays to a pair of photons with a small branching ratio. At higher masses, the decay to a\npair of (possibly off-shell) W \u00b1 or Z 0 bosons becomes dominant.\nThe most abundant signal topologies, containing bb\u0304 pairs are unfortunately hard to separate from the large QCD\nbackground. The following gives a summary of the discovery channels being investigated at the LHC. In all cases,\nfull detector simulation was used, which included realistic descriptions of the material budget and detector geometry.\nThe trigger response was also realistically simulated, and systematic uncertainties were estimated. Next-to-leading\norder cross sections were used whenever available, and used to normalise simulated event samples.\n1\n\n\f34th International Conference on High Energy Physics, Philadelphia, 2008\n\nFigure 1: Left: ATLAS sensitivity in the H \u2192 4l channel for 30 f b\u22121 [9] (background estimation systematic uncertainties\nare included); centre: four-lepton invariant mass distribution in the H \u2192 ZZ (\u2217) \u2192 2e2\u03bc channel in CMS [10]; right: CMS\nsensitivity in H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel for 30 f b\u22121 [10].\n\n2.1. Higgs boson decay to four leptons: H \u2192 ZZ (\u2217) \u2192 4l (4e, 4\u03bc or 2e2\u03bc)\nThis channel provides excellent sensitivity for a wide range of mH above 130 GeV/c2 , except for the interval between\n2mW and 2mZ , where the Higgs boson branching ratio is dominated by H \u2192 W + W \u2212 . The main background is\npp \u2192 ZZ (\u2217) \u2192 4l\u00b1 . Other backgrounds, such as Zbb\u0304, ZW , tt\u0304, and Z + X are effectively suppressed by the analysis\nevent selection. Both CMS and ATLAS rely on selecting events which contain pairs of electrons or muons with\nopposite charge. At least one Z 0 is expected to be on mass shell, and the two-lepton invariant mass is used to\nreject fake and misidentified leptons. A clear four-lepton mass peak above a flat background is expected in this\nchannel (see figure 1, left), thus allowing a good background estimation from the peak sidebands. Two factors\nare especially significant for analyses of this channel: the lepton reconstruction efficiency and the invariant-mass\nresolution. Both experiments show similar experimental sensitivities in this channel, with the total signal significance\nfor each experiment expected to be in excess of 10 for an integrated luminosity of 30 f b\u22121 (see figure 1, centre).\n\n2.2. Higgs boson decay to two photons: H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\nIn spite of the low Higgs boson branching ratio to two photons (around 0.2% for mH = 120 GeV/c2 ), this channel\nshows very good sensitivity in a range of mH between the LEP limit and mH \u223c 140 GeV/c2 . The main irreducible\nbackground is the direct \u03b3\u03b3 production. Signal appears as a sharp peak over a smoothly falling di-photon invariant\nmass distribution. Reducible instrumental backgrounds such as \u03b3 + jet and multijet production, where one or more\nparticles are misidentified as photons, are important due to the large QCD cross sections. Both experiments need to\ntake photon conversions into account, since \u223c 60% of Higgs events contain at least one converted photon.\nBoth collaborations classify the selected events into several categories, according to the event kinematics or topology. In this way, the event selection can be optimized, in order to maximize the background discrimination without\ndegrading the efficiency for selecting signal events. In ATLAS, a significance of about 3.5\u03c3 is expected for 10 f b\u22121 ,\nassuming mH = 120 GeV/c2 . With an optimized analysis employing a neural network, CMS expects up to 10\u03c3 after\ncollecting 30 f b\u22121 and a 5\u03c3 after accumulating 8 f b\u22121 (see figure 1, right). Analyses are also being developed to\ntarget the associated production channels ZH, W H and tt\u0304H.\n\n2.3. Higgs boson decay to a tau pair: H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212\nThis channel currently provides one of the best sensitivities at low mH . Analyses rely on the topology of VBF\nevents to provide additional rejection against SM backgrounds. In this process, the Higgs boson is radiated by W \u00b1\nor Z 0 bosons exchanged between the interacting partons. Due to the lack of colour flow between the two interacting\npartons, the characteristic event topology consists of two relatively forward jets with a rapidity gap in between,\ncontaining little hadronic activity. Both ATLAS and CMS investigate this channel for all final states, in which at\n2\n\n\f34th International Conference on High Energy Physics, Philadelphia, 2008\n\nFigure 2: Left: \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 invariant mass distribution in the H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel in ATLAS with one \u03c4 decaying hadronically and\nmH = 120 GeV/c2 [9]; centre: expected sensitivity for the H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel in ATLAS (systematic uncertainties due to the\nbackground estimation are included) [10]; right: transverse mass in the H \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd in the CMS analysis [10].\n\nleast one tau decays to an electron or muon plus neutrinos. The final state where both taus decay hadronically\nwas also investigated by ATLAS and proved to be feasible, but there is as yet no detailed sensitivity estimates. The\ndominant background in all cases is Z + jets with the Z boson decaying to \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 . Both collaborations have developed\ndata-driven methods to estimate these backgrounds. Other backgrounds are W + N jets, tt\u0304, and di-jet events.\nThe \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 invariant mass reconstruction requires an approximation, in which the \u03c4 \u00b1 is assumed to be collinear\nwith the visible lepton (in \u03c4 \u2192 e or \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc decays). The resulting Higgs mass resolution can be observed in figure 2\n(left). The expected sensitivity for this channel, currently reaches up to 5\u03c3 for 30 f b\u22121.\n\n2.4. Higgs boson decay to a W boson pair: H \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd (l = e\u00b1 or \u03bc\u00b1 )\nThe Higgs boson decay to a W + W \u2212 pair provides the most sensitive search channel in the mass range 2mW <\nmH < 2mZ , where this decay mode has a branching ratio above 95%. Analyses have concentrated on final states\ncontaining electrons or muons from the W \u00b1 decay. Contrary to the remaining channels, though, the presence of high\ntransverse momentum neutrinos makes it unfeasible to obtain a Higgs mass peak. The transverse mass [10] can still\nbe calculated and used in the event selection (see figure 2, right). Analyses in this channel then need to rely on a\nvery good knowledge of the background shape and normalisation.\nThe dominant backgrounds come from events containing a W-boson pair, most importantly W + W \u2212 and tt\u0304 production. The H \u2192 W + W \u2212 decay creates a correlation between the W spins in the Higgs reference frame which\ntranslates into an angular correlation between the leptons emitted in the W-bosons decay. This is exploited to\nsuppress the W + W \u2212 background. The tt\u0304 background can be effectively suppressed by a veto on central jets (jets\nwith a small pseudorapidity value). Separate analyses are performed for the cases where there are no high transverse\nmomentum jets present in the event and where there are two additional jets, directed at the gluon fusion and the\nVBF production modes, respectively. For a Higgs boson mass close 160 GeV/c2 a sensitivity in excess of 10\u03c3 is\nexpected for each experiment for 30 f b\u22121 of integrated luminosity. Additional channels being explored are the VBF\nH \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 l\u03bd + 2jets and the associated production channels W \u00b1 H and tt\u0304H.\n\n3. Summary and Outlook\nThe expected sensitivity of ATLAS and CMS to a SM Higgs boson was evaluated by both collaborations. Analyses\nin both experiments show similar sensitivity in most channels. The sensitivity for SM Higgs discovery in the various\nchannels is illustrated by figure 3 for the CMS case. An integrated luminosity of less than 10 f b\u22121 should be enough to\nmake a 5\u03c3 discovery in the mass range above the LEP limit. Preliminary ATLAS studies indicate that an integrated\n3\n\n\f34th International Conference on High Energy Physics, Philadelphia, 2008\n\nFigure 3: SM Higgs discovery potential for CMS assuming an integrated luminosty of 30 f b\u22121 (left) and integrated luminosity\nneeded for a 5\u03c3 Higgs discovery, versus Higgs boson mass [10]).\n2\n<\nluminosity of 2 f b\u22121 would be enough to exclude the Higgs boson in the range 121GeV/c2 <\n\u223c mH \u223c 460GeV/c at\n95% confidence level. Other analyses, not described here, may contribute to further enhancements of the sensitivity.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to express his thanks to ATLAS and CMS colleagues.
