INTRODUCTION\n\nThe measurement of the azimuthal distributions of outgoing particles with respect to the reaction plane in noncentral\nheavy ion collisions-the flow analysis-is an important probe of the interaction region of the collision [1]. In particular,\nit has raised much interest at ultrarelativistic energies [2] where it may signal the formation of a quark-gluon plasma\n[3]. In addition, combining flow and two-particle interferometry results yields a three-dimensional picture of the\nemitting source [4,5]. Therefore, accurate flow measurements are highly needed.\nAzimuthal distributions are characterized by the Fourier coefficients [6]\nE\nD\n(1)\nvn \u2261 ein(\u03c6\u2212\u03a6R ) = hcos n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a6R )i ,\nwhere \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of an emitted particle in the laboratory frame, \u03a6R is the azimuth of the reaction plane,\nand angular brackets denote a statistical average over many particles and events. Ideally, vn should be measured for\nvarious particles as a function of their transverse momentum pT and rapidity y (\"differential\" flow). The first two\nharmonics v1 and v2 are the so-called directed and elliptic flows, respectively.\nSince the azimuth \u03a6R in a given event is unknown, the coefficients vn are extracted from the azimuthal correlations\nbetween outgoing particles. The underlying idea is that the correlation of every particle with the reaction plane\ninduces correlations between the particles. Standard methods extract flow from two-particle azimuthal correlations,\neither directly [7], or through the correlation between two \"subevents\" [8,9]. However, the correlation between\ntwo given particles is not only due to flow, and the other sources of correlation-as, e.g., quantum Bose-Einstein\neffects, momentum conservation, resonance decays, jets-may dominate the measured signal, especially for peripheral\ncollisions, thereby spoiling the validity of the analysis [10,11]. The impact of \"nonflow\" correlations on the flow\nanalysis might tentatively be minimized: cuts in phase space can be used to avoid the influence of quantum effects and\nresonance decays, while the contribution of momentum conservation to the measured correlation can be calculated and\nsubtracted [11,12]. However, the various recipes require some a priori knowledge of nonflow correlations; furthermore\nit is necessary to assume that all sources of such correlations are known and accounted for, which may not be true.\nTo remedy the contamination from nonflow correlations, which amounts to systematic uncertainties on the flow\nvalues, we have introduced new methods of flow analysis, based on a cumulant expansion of multiparticle azimuthal\ncorrelations [13,14]. The principle of the methods is that when cumulants of higher order are considered, the relative\ncontribution of nonflow effects, and thus the corresponding systematic error, decreases. Recently, this cumulant\nexpansion has been successfully applied by the STAR Collaboration at RHIC [2,15].\nMore precisely, the cumulant of 2k-particle azimuthal correlations, which we denote cn {2k} (where n is the Fourier\nharmonic and 2k is an even integer, in practice 2, 4 or 6), is a quantity built with all the measured azimuthal\ncorrelations up to order 2k, i.e., the hexp[in(\u03c61 + \u03c62 + * * * + \u03c6k\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6k\u2032 +1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 \u03c6k\u2032 +k\u2032\u2032 )]i, with k \u2032 + k \u2032\u2032 \u2264 2k. The\nkey feature of the cumulant is that it eliminates the contribution of lower order correlations, so that only the genuine\n2k-particle correlation remains. Flow, which is essentially a collective effect, gives a contribution to the cumulant\nproportional to vn2k . The remaining contribution, from 2k-particle nonflow correlations, scales as N 1\u22122k , where N is\nthe total multiplicity of particles emitted in an event [13]. Therefore, the flow dominates if\nvn2k \u226b\n\n1\nN 2k\u22121\n\n\u21d4\n\nvn \u226b\n\n1\n.\nN 1\u22121/2k\n\n(2)\n\nStated differently, if the cumulant cn {2k} is much larger than N 1\u22122k , it is dominated by flow, and therefore yields\nan estimate of vn , which we denote vn {2k}, with a systematic error (due to unknown nonflow correlations) of order\nO((N vn )1\u22122k ). When k increases, the systematic error decreases: this is why the estimate vn {4} derived from the\nfourth cumulant is a priori more accurate than vn {2}, which is in fact the value given by two-particle methods.\n1\n\n\fIn the following, we describe the practical implementation of the method, referring the reader to Refs. [13,14]\nfor further theoretical justifications. The first step consists in deriving a global measurement of vn , integrated over\nsome phase-space region, typically a detector acceptance, for a given centrality class (Sec. II): this is equivalent\nto reconstructing the reaction plane and obtaining the \"event plane resolution\" in the subevent method [8]. This\n\"integrated\" flow serves as reference for the differential flow analysis discussed in Sec. III. An important feature of\nour method is that it automatically takes into account azimuthal inhomogeneities in the acceptance of the detector.\nIn the case of a detector with only partial azimuthal coverage, minor modifications occur, which are given in Sec. IV.\nII. INTEGRATED FLOW\n\nConsider a data set of Nevts events of approximately the same centrality, recorded in a run with a constant detector\nacceptance. In this section, we explain how estimates of the flow, integrated over the detector acceptance, can be\nobtained from cumulants of 2-, 4-, and 6-particle correlations.\nWe denote by \u03c6j the azimuths of the outgoing particles with respect to a fixed direction in the laboratory. The\nvarious quantities of interest are constructed from the real-valued generating function [14]\nGn (z) =\n\nM h\nM h\ni\nY\n\u0001i Y\nwj \u2217 in\u03c6j\nwj\n1+\n1+\n+ ze\u2212in\u03c6j =\nz e\n(2x cos(n\u03c6j ) + 2y sin(n\u03c6j )) ,\nM\nM\nj=1\nj=1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the product runs over M particles detected in a single event and z = x + iy is an arbitrary complex number.\nThis generating function has no physical meaning in itself, but after averaging over events, the coefficients of its\nexpansion in powers of z and z \u2217 \u2261 x \u2212 iy yield multiparticle azimuthal correlations of arbitrary orders. In practice,\nthe variable z corresponds to interpolation points used to estimate the various quantities encountered in the analysis,\nas will be explained shortly.\nAs in the standard flow analysis, a weight wj is attributed to particle j, which is a function of particle type, transverse\nmomentum, and rapidity. Naturally, the integrated flow obtained from this generating function will be weighted by\nw, i.e. Vn \u2261 w ein(\u03c6\u2212\u03a6R ) . The weight must be chosen so as to maximize the effects of flow relative to statistical\np\nfluctuations. As we shall see below, this is achieved by maximizing the dimensionless quantity \u03c7n \u2261 Vn M/ hw2 i\n(this quantity also characterizes the event plane resolution in the standard flow analysis [9]). As a consequence, the\noptimal weight for a given particle is its flow vn (pT , y) itself [13]. Thus, a thorough flow analysis should go twice\nthrough Secs. II and III. The first time, integrated flow can be extracted using some reasonable guess for the weights,\nthereby obtaining values for vn (pT , y); in turn, these values will serve as weights in the second, final analysis [16].\nIn Eq. (3), the number M of particles should be the same for all events: in each event, a set of M particles must\nbe randomly chosen out of the Mtot detected particles.\nIn order to obtain the cumulants, one first averages Gn (z) over events, which yields an average generating function\nhGn (z)i. We then define [14]\nh\ni\n1/M\nCn (z) \u2261 M hGn (z)i\n\u22121 .\n(4)\nThe cumulant of 2k-particle correlations cn {2k} is the coefficient of z k z \u2217k /(k!)2 in the power-series expansion of Cn (z).\nTo construct the first three cumulants, one may truncate the series to order |z|6 and compute Cn (z) at the following\ninterpolation points:\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2q\u03c0\n2q\u03c0\n,\nyp,q \u2261 r0 p sin\n,\n(5)\nzp,q = xp,q + iyp,q ,\nxp,q \u2261 r0 p cos\nqmax\nqmax\nfor p = 1, 2, 3 and q = 0, . . . , qmax \u2212 1, where qmax \u2265 8. The parameter r0 must be chosen as a compromise between\nerrors due to higher order terms in the power-series expansion, which rapidly increase with r0 , and numerical errors.\nAssuming that the numerical error is proportional to the total number of elementary operations performed (of order\np\n3/2\nM Nevts ), we obtain the estimate r0 \u2243 (\u01ebNevts M )1/8 M/ hw2 i where \u01eb is the accuracy of elementary operations,\ntypically 10\u221216 in double precision. This gives r0 \u223c 2 with weights of order unity and standard values of the\nmultiplicity (M \u223c 300) and number of events (Nevts \u223c 20000).\nOnce the values Cn (zp,q ) have been computed, they must be averaged over the phase of z:\nCp \u2261\n\n1\nqmax\n\nqmax\nX\u22121\nq=0\n\nCn (zp,q ),\n2\n\np = 1, 2, 3.\n\n(6)\n\n\fThe cumulants of 2-, 4- and 6-particle correlations are then given respectively by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n3\n6\n1\n1\ncn {4} = 4 (\u22125 C1 + 4 C2 \u2212 C3 ) ,\ncn {6} = 6 (3 C1 \u2212 3 C2 + C3 ) .\ncn {2} = 2 3 C1 \u2212 C2 + C3 ,\nr0\n2\n3\nr0\nr0\n\n(7)\n\nThese cumulants are related to the weighted integrated flow Vn \u2261 wein(\u03c6\u2212\u03a6R ) . This is the point where acceptance\nconsiderations come into play. If the detector has full azimuthal coverage, each cumulant cn {2k} gives an estimate of\nthe corresponding Vn , which we denote by Vn {2k}:\nVn {2}2 = cn {2},\n\nVn {4}4 = \u2212cn {4},\n\nVn {6}6 = cn {6}/4.\n\n(8)\n\nGeneralized relations valid for detectors with partial azimuthal coverage or efficiency are given in Sec. IV.\nIn practice, the use of higher order cumulants is often limited by statistics. The order of magnitude of statistical\nerrors can easily be estimated. The computation of the cumulant cn {2k} relies on the choice of 2k particles among M\nin each of the Nevts available events, i.e., it involves roughly M 2k Nevts (2k)-uplets of particles. Taking into account\nk p\nthe weights w, the resulting statistical uncertainty on cn {2k} is of order O( w2 / M 2k Nevts ). The relative error\non Vn {2k} is thus of order\n\u03b4Vn {2k}\n1\n.\n\u223c 2k \u221a\nVn {2k}\n\u03c7n Nevts\n\n(9)\n\np\nwith \u03c7n \u2261 Vn M/ hw2 i. A thorough calculation, performed in Ref. [14], Appendix D, shows that this order of magnitude is indeed correct as long as \u03c7n is not larger than unity, which is the case for most experiments at ultrarelativistic\nenergies.\nIn order to increase the statistics, it is possible to combine different runs performed in a given experiment, each of\nwhich has its own characteristics (different orientation of the magnetic field, etc.). For each of these runs, following the\nprocedure described above leads to cumulants cn,\u03b1 {2k} (where \u03b1 labels the run) and finally, accounting for the specific\nacceptance corrections, to flow estimates Vn,\u03b1 {2k}2k . The proper way to combine the runs consists in averaging the\nVn,\u03b1 {2k}2k (not the Vn,\u03b1 {2k}) of the various runs, weighted by the number of events in each run. Note that if\nstatistical fluctuations are large, it may happen that a run yield a negative value of Vn,\u03b1 {2k}2k . Such a run must\nnevertheless be included in the averaging procedure.\nIII. DIFFERENTIAL FLOW\n\nLet us turn to differential flow, i.e., to the flow of an identified particle in a restricted portion of phase space\n(typically a narrow pT or y interval). We call such a particle a \"proton\", and denote its azimuth by \u03c8; thus, the\ndifferential flow is vn\u2032 \u2261 ein(\u03c8\u2212\u03a6R ) , where the average value is taken over all protons.\nExperimentally, the differential flow is obtained from the azimuthal correlations between the proton and the particles\npreviously used to determine the integrated flow, which we call \"pions\". It is well known in the standard flow analysis\nthat from the reaction plane reconstructed in harmonic n, one may reconstruct not only the corresponding vn\u2032 , but\n\u2032\nalso higher harmonics vmn\n, where m is an integer (in practice, m = 1 or 2). Here, this is done by correlating the\nproton with m pions, i.e., by measuring hexp[in(m\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c61 \u2212 * * * \u2212 \u03c6m )]i. As in the case of integrated flow, nonflow\ncontributions to this correlation can be eliminated by going to higher orders, i.e., by correlating the proton with\n2k + m pions with k \u2265 0 (in practice k = 0 or 1), and constructing a cumulant dmn/n {2k + m + 1}. The subscript\n\u2032\nrefers to the fact that vmn\nis measured by using pions in harmonic n, while the number in curly brackets is the order\nof the correlation: 2k + m pions and 1 proton.\n\u2032\nThis cumulant retains only the contributions from flow, proportional to vmn\nVn2k+m , and from (2k + m + 1)-particle\n2k+m\nnonflow correlations, which scale like O(1/N\n): all lower order nonflow correlations have been removed. If the\n\u2032\ncontribution of flow dominates, the cumulant dmn/n {2k + m + 1} yields an estimate of vmn\n, which we naturally denote\n\u2032\nvmn/n {2k + m + 1}.\nAs in the case of integrated flow, we derive the cumulants dmn/n {2k + m + 1} using a generating function, namely\nDmn/n (z) \u2261\n\neimn\u03c8 Gn (z)\n.\nhGn (z)i\n\n(10)\n\nThe cumulant dmn/n {2k+m+1} is the real part of the coefficient of z \u2217k z k+m /[k!(k+m)!] in the power-series expansion\nof Dmn/n (z). In the numerator of Eq. (10), the average is performed over all protons (i.e., an event with 2 protons is\n3\n\n\fcounted twice; this was not stated correctly in [14]). On the other hand, the denominator is averaged over all events.\nIf the proton is one of the \"pions\", i.e., if it was used in the calculation of the generating function Eq. (3), one should\ndivide Gn (z) by 1 + wj (z \u2217 ein\u03c8 + ze\u2212in\u03c8 )/M , where \u03c8 is the proton azimuth, to avoid autocorrelations. Note that\nwhile the number of pions in Eq. (3) was fixed, the number of protons must be allowed to fluctuate from event to\nevent: to increase statistics, one should use all available protons.\nTo extract the cumulants, one computes the product z \u2217m Dmn/n (z) at the points zp,q , Eq. (5); one then takes the\nreal part, and averages over angles:\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a \u0001m qmax\nX\u22121 \u0014\nr0 p\n2q\u03c0\n2q\u03c0\ncos m\nXp,q + sin m\nYp,q ,\nDp \u2261\nqmax\nqmax\nqmax\nq=0\n\n(11)\n\nwith p = 1, 2, 3 and Xp,q + iYp,q \u2261 Dmn/n (zp,q ). Note that although we present the integrated and differential flow\nanalyses as two successive steps, they are in fact simultaneous: while the generating function Gn (z) is calculated for\na given event, one can at the same time compute its product by eimn\u03c8 for the numerator of Eq. (10).\n\u2032\n\u2032\nFor m = 1 (useful for v1/1\nor v2/2\n), the lowest order cumulants are given by\ndn/n {2} =\n\n1\nr02\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2 D1 \u2212 D2 ,\n2\n\ndn/n {4} =\n\n1\n(\u22122 D1 + D2 ) ,\nr04\n\n(12)\n\n\u2032\nwhile for m = 2, which can be used to derive v2/1\n,\n\n1\nd2n/n {3} = 4\nr0\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n4 D1 \u2212 D2 ,\n2\n\n1\nd2n/n {5} = 6\nr0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n3\n\u22126 D1 + D2 .\n2\n\n(13)\n\nThese cumulants must then be related to the differential flow. For a perfect detector:\n\u2032\nvn/n\n{4} = \u2212dn/n {4}/Vn3 ,\n\u2032\nv2n/n\n{5} = \u2212d2n/n {5}/(2Vn4 ).\n\n\u2032\nvn/n\n{2} = dn/n {2}/Vn ,\n\u2032\nv2n/n {3} = d2n/n {3}/Vn2 ,\n\n(14)\n\nNote that these relations involve the integrated flow Vn obtained in the previous section. Relations for a nonisotropic\nacceptance are given in next Section. The order of magnitude of the statistical uncertainty can be estimated using\nthe same arguments as for integrated flow. One obtains\n\u2032\n{2k + m + 1} \u223c\n\u03b4vmn/n\n\n1\n\u221a ,\n\u03c72k+m\nN\u2032\nn\n\n(15)\n\nwhere N \u2032 is the number of protons used in the analysis. It may be worth noticing that the statistical error does not\nonly depends on the available event statistics and multiplicity. It also strongly depends on the flow itself through the\nparameter \u03c7n .\nIV. ACCEPTANCE CORRECTIONS\n\nOur method can be used even when the detector used to measure the particle azimuths has only partial azimuthal\ncoverage, provided that the event centralities be determined with an independent detector, as, e.g., a ZDC, with an\napproximately isotropic coverage. This is to make sure that the apparent multiplicity/centrality is not biased by the\norientation of the reaction plane with respect to the detector.\nA specific detector is characterized by its acceptance/efficiency function A(j, \u03c6, pT , y), which represents the probability that a particle of type j (pion, proton, etc.) with azimuth \u03c6, transverse momentum pT , and rapidity y, be\ndetected. In practice, A(j, \u03c6, pT , y) is proportional to the number of hits in a (\u03c6, pT , y) bin, and thus can be obtained\nin a straightforward way while scanning through the data. The Fourier coefficients of the acceptance function are\nAn (j, pT , y) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nA(j, \u03c6, pT , y) e\u2212in\u03c6 d\u03c6.\n\n(16a)\n\n0\n\nThese differential coefficients can be integrated, with appropriate weighting and a sum over the various types of\nparticles used for the flow analysis, so as to describe the \"integrated\" acceptance of the detector:\n\n4\n\n\fXZ\n\nw(j, pT , y) An (j, pT , y) dpT dy\n\nj\n\nan = X Z\n\n.\n\n(16b)\n\nw(j, pT , y) A0 (j, pT, y) dpT dy\n\nj\n\nNote our introducing the weights w(j, pT , y), which are of course the same as in Eq. (3).\nWhen the acceptance of a detector is not perfectly isotropic in \u03c6, the cumulants Eq. (7) will mix different flow\nharmonics: cn {2k} does not depend only on Vn , but also on other Vp with p 6= n. For instance,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nc1 {4} = \u2212 (1 \u2212 |a1 |2 )4 + 4 (1 \u2212 |a1 |2 )2 |a2 \u2212 a21 |2 + |a2 \u2212 a21 |4 V14\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(17a)\n\u2212 |a1 \u2212 a2 a\u22171 |4 + 4 |a1 \u2212 a2 a\u22171 |2 |a3 \u2212 a1 a2 |2 + |a3 \u2212 a1 a2 |4 V24 ,\nand\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nc2 {4} = \u2212 |a1 \u2212 a2 a\u22171 |4 + 4 |a1 \u2212 a2 a\u22171 |2 |a3 \u2212 a1 a2 |2 + |a3 \u2212 a1 a2 |4 V14\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 |a2 |2 )4 + 4 (1 \u2212 |a2 |2 )2 |a4 \u2212 a22 |2 + |a4 \u2212 a22 |4 V24 ,\n\n(17b)\n\nwhere we have assumed that all other flow harmonics Vn\u22653 are negligible. The corresponding relations for the\ncumulants c1 {2} and c2 {2} can be found in Ref. [14], Appendix C1. If the detector acceptance is not too bad, the\ncoefficients ak6=0 will be small, and these expressions are close to Eqs. (8), valid for perfect detector.\nEquations (17) form a linear system which can easily be inverted to express V14 and V24 (or, more precisely, the\nestimates V1 {4}4 and V2 {4}4) as functions of c1 {4} and c2 {4}.\nLet us now consider differential flow. Integrated and differential flows may be measured using two different detectors: for instance, a large acceptance detector for integrated flow, and a smaller one, but with better particle\nidentification or pT determination, for differential flow. For sake of generality, we thus denote by A\u2032 (j, \u03c8, pT , y) the\ncorresponding acceptance function and by A\u2032k (j, pT , y) its Fourier coefficients defined as in (16a). The differential\nacceptance coefficients a\u2032k are then defined as in Eq. (16b), without the weights and the summation over j (since one\nusually measures the differential flow of identified particles) and with the integration over pT and y restricted to the\nphase-space region under interest (typically, one integrates over pT or y, so as to obtain vn as a function of y or pT ,\nrespectively).\nOnce again, anisotropies in the detector acceptance lead to some interference between the flow harmonics in the\nexpressions of the cumulants dmn/n {2k + m + 1}. Here are, for example, the relations between the lowest order\ncumulants and flow which allow one to extract the differential directed flow v1\u2032 and the differential elliptic flow v2\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nobtained either with respect to V1 or V2 , i.e., what we denote v2/1\nand v2/2\n(relations for other cumulants can be\nfound in Ref.

Of course, they reduce to Eqs. (14) when the acceptance is isotropic.\nAny two of Eqs. (18) constitute a linear system which can be inverted to obtain v1\u2032 and v2\u2032 once V1 and V2 have\nbeen extracted.\n\n5\n\n\fV. ADDITIONAL REMARKS AND COMMENTS\n\nThe cumulant method not only eliminates nonflow correlations, it also provides several independent estimates of\nthe flow from cumulants of various orders. Since nonflow correlations between 4 or more particles are expected to\nbe negligible, Vn {4} and Vn {6} should be consistent with each other within statistical error bars. With the high\nmultiplicity produced at ultrarelativistic energies and the large acceptance detectors available, estimates show that\none could even construct cumulants of 8-, 10-particle correlations. Since the generating function formalism yields all\ncumulant orders at once, one would simply need to increase the number of interpolation points zp,q , which would\nresult in a moderate increase in computer time. Checking that all higher order cumulants yield compatible values of\nVn would give the first direct evidence that azimuthal correlations are of collective origin. Similarly, in the case of\ndifferential flow, various cumulants orders yield independent estimates which can be compared to one another.\nOther consistency checks can be proposed to test the reliability of the results. First, one should perform the analysis\nwith at least two values of the parameter r0 entering Eq. (5), in order to check the stability against numerical errors.\nThen, one can try different values of M in Eq. (3), as, for instance, M = 0.8 hMtot i and M = 0.6 hMtot i. That may\nalso be a way to increase the statistics. In the same spirit, it is still possible to let M vary from event to event in\nEq. (3), taking M = Mtot , especially if the acceptance is reasonably good. In that case, M must be replaced by the\naverage hMtot i in Eq. (4), and one should check that the results are consistent with what would be obtained with a\nfixed M .\nThe last consistency check regards differential flow. We have seen that the integrated flow Vn can be calculated\nusing different weights wj ; the resulting weighted averages Vn 's differ. However, the values of the differential flow\n\u2032\nvmn/n\n{2k + m + 1} obtained with different weights should be consistent within error bars if they are not contaminated\nby nonflow effects.\nThe recent STAR analysis [15] illustrates quite well the relevance of cumulants to the flow analysis: for integrated\nflow, the lowest order Vn {2} reproduces the results of the standard two-particle methods, as it should. On the other\nhand, the higher order estimate Vn {4} is lower than Vn {2} beyond statistical error bars, especially for peripheral\ncollisions, thereby suggesting that nonflow correlations are important. Although statistical uncertainties on higher\norder cumulants are larger, this loss is therefore compensated by the gain on errors from nonflow effects.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank N. N.
