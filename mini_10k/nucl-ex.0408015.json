These\nmeasurements were performed at fixed transferred momentum and energy, q = 1502 MeV/c and\n\u03c9 = 840 MeV, respectively, for missing momenta pm up to 1 GeV/c and missing energies in the\ncontinuum region, up to pion threshold; this kinematic coverage is much more extensive than that of\nany previous experiment. The cross section data are presented along with the effective momentum\ndensity distribution and compared to theoretical models.\nPACS numbers: 25.30.Fj, 21.45+v, 24.85.+p, 27.10.+h\n\nThe role of correlations in nuclear structure remains a\ntopic of primary importance. On the theoretical side, it\nis clear that correlations in the nuclear wave function\nmust exist. The question is whether correlations can\nbe understood as arising from the N N force and threebody forces, or whether it will be necessary to invoke\nquark degrees of freedom. However, the role of correlations in the available experimental data is often obscure. Attempts to make more definitive measurements\nwith exclusive (e, e\u2032 p) or (e, e\u2032 N N ) measurements suffer\n\nfrom reaction mechanism ambiguities; physics such as\nmeson-exchange currents (MEC), isobar configurations\n(IC), and final-state interactions (FSI) mask the effects\nof correlations. Better experimental data are needed for\na definitive conclusion.\nIn this letter, we present an attempt to improve the\nstudy of correlations, using the 3 He(e, e\u2032 p)pn reaction.\nThe measurements are in kinematics designed to suppress\nthe effects of some of the complicating underlying physics\nand enhance correlations. In particular, we choose high\n\n\f2\nfour-momentum transfer Q2 to suppress MEC and to\nget a resolution smaller than the nucleon size, quasifree\nkinematics x \u2248 1 to suppress IC, and the continuum\nthree-body breakup (3bbu) channel. A recent study [1]\nof 16 O(e, e\u2032 p)X demonstrates the greater kinematic coverage and statistical precision achievable with the current\ngeneration of accelerator facilities; the results presented\nhere for the 3 He(e, e\u2032 p)pn reaction are by a large margin\nthe most comprehensive, high resolution, experimental\ninvestigation of the continuum region.\nTo further motivate the studies presented, in particular the choice of the 3bbu channel, we present two signatures of N N correlations in 3 He that one might expect to observe in the (e, e\u2032 p) reaction, in the absence of\ncomplicating reaction mechanisms. Consider two correlated nucleons, which in their center of mass system have\nequal and opposite momenta, \u00b1~\npc , with higher momenta\nreflecting smaller separations. An electron scattering on\na proton belonging to such a correlated pair inside 3 He\n[2, 3] transfers energy \u03c9 and momentum ~\nq . If the spectator nucleon is at rest, the struck proton is ejected with\nmomentum ~q \u2212 ~pc , while the other nucleon of the pair\nmoves off with the recoil momentum of the reaction, ~pc .\nThe spectator nucleon and the undetected nucleon of the\npair constitute a recoil system of mass:\n\u0014\n\u00152\nq\n2 + p2\nMr2 = Mspec + MN\n\u2212 p2c .\n(1)\nc\nHere MN is the nucleon mass and Mspec is the mass\nof the spectator nucleon. Thus, in this simple reaction mechanism picture, a signature of correlations is a\npeak in the 3bbu cross section as a function of missing energy, Em , with the position depending on pc :\nEm = Mr + Mp \u2212 M3 He . The peak width reflects the\nmotion of the center of mass with respect to the spectator nucleon.\nThe total strength of the correlation peak as a function\nof momentum yields a second signature of N N correlations. While we expect N N correlations to generally be\nmore important at missing momenta greater than the\nFermi momentum, the 3bbu strength will be enhanced\nrelative to that for 2bbu as missing momentum increases\ndue to a reduced probability for the two undetected nucleons to form a bound deuteron at high pc .\nAn apparent correlation peak in the continuum was observed with limited statistics and limited kinematic range\nfor the first time at Saclay [4], on 3 He, and subsequently\non 4 He [5]. Simply interpreting the data as evidence for\ncorrelations, as suggested by the simple reaction mechanism picture of Fig. 1a, neglects the complications of\nMEC, IC, and FSI. In particular, the derivation of the\npeak position is purely kinematic, and the peak can appear as long as the electrodisintegration involves two active nucleons plus spectator nucleons. Thus, when the\ntwo nucleons in the active pair rescatter, Fig. 1b, the\nposition and width of the peak do not change, and the\n\nFIG. 1: Feynman diagrams for a) direct disintegration, b)\nrescattering, and c) rescattering with the spectator nucleon.\n\nsimple picture remains valid, but one measures the transition between a correlated pair in the ground state and\na correlated pair in the continuum. But when one of the\nnucleons of the active pair re-interacts with the spectator\nthird nucleon, Fig. 1c, the position, shape, and amplitude\nof the peak might all be affected. Rescattering also makes\nthe measured missing momentum pm different from the\ncorrelation momentum pc , so it is clear then that the\nobserved momentum distribution does not simply reflect\nthe nuclear wave function \u2013 it is not an actual density.\nThe lack of an apparent correlation peak in continuum\n(e, e\u2032 p) on heavier nuclei, e.g., 16 O [1], is believed to result from the small probability of having only two active\nnucleons when the number of spectators gets large.\n\nIn Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility\n(JLab) Hall A experiment E89-044 [6], we studied the\n3\nHe(e, e\u2032 p) reaction in the quasi-elastic region at transferred 3-momentum |~q | = 1502 MeV/c and energy \u03c9 =\n840 MeV, so Q2 = 1.55 GeV2 . This paper reports the results of measurements in perpendicular kinematics with\nBjorken x = 0.98, near the top of the quasifree peak. Protons were detected at several angles relative to ~q, corresponding to missing momenta pm of 0 - 1 GeV/c. Results\nof the 3 He(e, e\u2032 p)d reaction channel from this experiment\nwere reported in [7]; here we focus on the continuum\n3\nHe(e, e\u2032 p)pn channel, Em > 7.72 MeV.\nA continuous, \u2248120 \u03bcA, electron beam was scattered\nfrom 3 He in a 10 cm diameter cylindrical cell, mounted\nwith the beam passing through the center of the target perpendicular to the symmetry axis. The 3 He target\ndensity was \u2248 0.072 g/cm3 [7]. The scattered electrons\nand knocked-out protons were detected in the two HighResolution Spectrometers (HRSe and HRSh ). Details of\nthe Hall A experimental setup are given in [8]; see [9] for\nfurther details of this experiment.\nThroughout the experiment, singles 3 He(e, e\u2032 ) quasielastic scattering data, measured simultaneously with coincidence 3 He(e, e\u2032 p), provided a continuous monitor of\nboth luminosity and beam energy. The absolute normalization of our data was determined by comparing\nmeasurements of elastic scattering data to world data\n[10]. We measured the 3 He(e, e\u2032 p)X cross section at three\n\n\f3\nbeam energies, keeping |~\nq | and \u03c9 fixed in order to separate response functions and understand systematic uncertainties. The data reported in this paper were all obtained at a beam energy of 4806 MeV.\nThe missing energy resolution, about 1 MeV (\u03c3), is less\nthan the 2.23 MeV separation between the 3 He(e, e\u2032 p)d\npeak and the threshold for the 3 He(e, e\u2032 p)pn breakup\nchannels. The radiative corrections to the measured cross\nsections were performed by using the code MCEEP [11].\nThe radiative tail is simulated and folded into the (Em ,\npm ) space based on the prescription of Borie and Drechsel [12]. The radiative corrections in the continuum\namount to 10 \u2212 20% of the cross section. In particular, the radiative corrections remove the tail of the 2bbu\nprocess from the 3bbu data, allowing a clear separation\nof the channels. An exception is for low missing momentum, below 100 MeV/c, where the 3bbu strength is\nless than the strength of the radiative tail of the much\nstronger 2bbu peak.\nTable I shows the central proton spectrometer settings\nfor the experimental kinematics presented in this paper.\nThe data taken at these settings are grouped into numerous (Em , pm ) bins for presentation; Fig. 2 shows the cross\nsections corrected for radiative processes as a function of\nmissing energy for several selected bins. The energy scale\nin the horizontal axis has been shifted in these plots so\nthat the 3bbu channel starts at 0. As pm increases, we\ncan see that the broad peak in the cross section moves to\nhigher missing energies. The arrow in the figure indicates\nwhere one would expect the peak in the cross section due\nto disintegration processes involving two active nucleons\nplus a spectator; the expected peak position for pm =\n820 MeV/c is just off scale, at Em \u2248 145 MeV. The large\npeak in the data roughly aligned with the arrow suggests\nthat two-nucleon disintegration processes are dominant.\nSeveral calculations are presented in Fig. 2. The simplest calculation is a plane-wave impulse approximation\n(PWIA) calculation using Salme's spectral function [13]\nand the \u03c3cc1 electron-proton off-shell cross section [14].\nAlso shown in Fig. 2 are the results of microscopic calculations of the continuum cross section by J. M. Laget\n[15], including a PWIA calculation with correlations but\n\nTABLE I: Proton spectrometer kinematic settings.\npm\n(MeV/c)\n150\n300\n425\n550\n750\n1000\n\nPp\n(MeV/c)\n1493\n1472\n1444\n1406\n1327\n1171\n\n\u03b8p\n(\u25e6 )\n54.04\n59.83\n64.76\n69.80\n78.28\n89.95\n\nFIG. 2: (color online).\nCross-section results for the\n3\nHe(e, e\u2032 p)pn reaction versus missing energy Em .

Laget [19] from the PWIA (dash dot) to\nPWIA + FSI (long dash) to full calculation (solid), including\nmeson exchange current and final state interactions. In the\n620 MeV/c panel, the additional short dash curve is a calculation with PWIA + FSI only within the correlated pair.\n\n\f4\nno FSI, and successive implementation of various interaction effects. The calculation is based on a diagrammatic\nexpansion of the reaction amplitude, up to and including\ntwo loops [16]. Both single and double NN scattering, as\nwell as meson exchange (\u03c0 and \u03c1) and \u2206 formation are\nincluded. The bound-state wave function is a solution of\nthe Faddeev equation used by the Hannover group [17] for\nthe Paris potential [18]. Nucleon and meson propagators\nare relativistic and no angular approximations (Glauber)\nhave been made in the various loop integrals. The FSI\nin these calculations use a global parameterization of the\nN N scattering amplitude, obtained from experiments at\nLANL, SATURNE and COSY [19]. Further details of\nthe model can be found in [20].\nFigure 2 shows that the calculated cross sections exhibit a correlation peak that is dominant at low pm , but\nthat FSI strongly enhance the cross section at large pm .\nThe calculations indicate the FSI are mainly between the\ntwo active nucleons \u2013 Fig. 1b. The additional calculation\nincluded in the 620 MeV/c panel of Fig. 2 has FSI with\nthe spectator nucleon \u2013 Fig. 1c \u2013 turned off. Neither\nthe shape nor magnitude of the peak is much affected.\nThis result indicates that triple rescattering is negligible.\nMEC effects are also small.\n\nTo obtain the total 3bbu strength, and to facilitate\ncomparison to the 2bbu, we divided the cross section by\nthe elementary off-shell electron-proton cross section \u03c3ep\n[14], multiplied by a kinematic factor K, and integrated\n\nFIG. 3: (color online).

Uncertainties\nfrom missing tails of the 3bbu peak, within this integration range, due to limited experimental acceptance\nare negligible on the scale of Fig. 3. The 3bbu distribution tends to have a much larger relative strength for\nhigh missing momentum than does the 2bbu distribution\n- the ratio of 3bbu to 2bbu strength increases with pm\nby about three orders of magnitude, from about 100 to\n800 MeV/c. An increase of the relative strength with pm\nis consistent with what is expected from correlations, as\ndescribed in the simple picture in the introduction, but\nwe already know from the discussion of Fig. 2 that FSI\nare important.\nThe PWIA curves in Fig. 3 show an order of magnitude\nenhancement of the 3bbu over the 2bbu at high missing\nmomentum. The two-body correlations are more clearly\nseen in 3bbu than in the 2bbu since the available phase\nspace is reduced when two nucleons are forced to form\nthe deuteron. The differences between the PWIA calculations and full calculations further indicate the greater\nimportance of final-state interactions in the 3bbu. Thus,\nthe larger FSI in the 3bbu mask the larger role of correlations. The generally good agreement of the full calculations and the data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 relies mainly on\nthe interplay of correlations and final-state interactions,\nand indicates no need for physics beyond that already\npresent in a modern conventional nuclear physics model.\nThe conclusions presented here have been confirmed by\nsubsequent, independent calculations [21].\nThe conclusions described above might appear to be no\nlonger valid for pm \u2248 1 GeV/c as the magnitude of the\n3bbu appears to fall towards that of the 2bbu. However,\nthe center of the 3bbu correlation peak moves outside of\nthe integration range at pm \u2248 800 MeV/c, as shown in\nFig. 2. Thus, the experimental integration only includes\na fraction of the 3bbu strength at large pm . A crude\ncorrection to account for the missing strength, using the\nfraction of strength of the full calculation of Laget in the\nregion Em < 140 MeV, causes the 3bbu distribution to\nroughly flatten out, starting near 750 MeV/c, at a level\nnearly two orders of magnitude greater than that of the\n2bbu. The large correction also leads to our stopping the\ncalculation at 1 GeV/c; the comparison between data and\ntheory is no longer meaningful when only a small fraction of the tail of the distribution is considered. Given\nthese data along with the theoretical calculations, it remains fair to conclude that the correlations in the wave\nfunction preferentially lead to the 3bbu channel, and that\nthe reaction mechanism is reasonably well understood in\na modern, conventional nuclear physics model.\n\n\f5\nThe comparison of the data of this experiment with\nthe existing calculation suggests that the region near 300\nMeV/c might prove to be the most enlightening with respect to the role of correlations. Here the full and PWIA\ncurves are very similar to each other and to the data,\nand in the theory the correlation peak dominates the\ncross section. Separated response functions, which are\npossible with data from the other kinematics of this experiment, can provide us with more complete tests of the\ntheory.\nIn summary, results for the cross section at constant ~q\nand \u03c9 have been presented for the 3 He(e, e\u2032 p)pn reaction\nchannel. The experimental data are both much higher\nin statistics and more extensive in kinematic coverage\nthan any previous measurement. Model calculations are\nin good agreement with the data. We believe these are\nbenchmark data which will serve to stimulate additional\nindependent calculations, and help to define the role of\ncorrelations in nuclear structure.\nWe acknowledge the outstanding support of the staff\nof the Accelerator and Physics Divisions at JLab that\nmade this experiment successful.
