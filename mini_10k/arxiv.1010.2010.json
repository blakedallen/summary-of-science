In this second case it has been pointed out that they can\ncontribute to the vacuum energy, a possibility that remains realistic if their mass ma - which in this case\nshould be \u223c 10\u221233 eV and smaller - is of electroweak [11] and not of QCD origin. In this case they differ\nsignificantly from the standard (Peccei-Quinn, PQ) invisible axion.\nAccording to this scenario, the vacuum misalignment (see [12, 13] for a discussion in the PQ case)\ninduced at the electroweak scale would guarantee that the degree of freedom associated with the axion\nfield remains frozen, rolling down very slowly towards the minimum of the non-perturbative instanton\npotential, with ma much smaller than the current Hubble rate. Given the rather tight experimental\nconstraints which have significantly affected the parameter space (axion mass and gauge couplings) for\nPQ axions [14, 15, 16], the study of these types of fields has also taken into account the possibility to\nevade the current bounds [17, 18]. These are summarized both into an upper and a lower bound on the\nsize of fa , the axion decay constant, which sets the scale of the misalignment angle \u03b8, defined as the ratio\nof the axion field (a) over the PQ scale vP Q (vP Q \u223c fa ).\nAxion-like particles can be reasonably described by pseudoscalar fields characterized by an enlarged\nparameter space for mass and couplings, with a direct coupling to the gauge fields (of the form aF F\u0303 )\nwhose strength remains unrelated to their mass. They have been at the center of several recent and less\nrecent studies (see for instance [19, 20] [21, 22, 23, 18, 24, 25]). They are supposed to inherit most of the\nproperties of a typical invisible axion - a PQ axion - while acquiring some others which are not allowed\nto it.\nWe recall that the axion mass (which in the PQ case is O(\u039b2QCD /fa ) and the axion coupling to the\ngauge fields are indeed related by the same constant fa . In the PQ case fa (\u223c 1010 \u2212 1012 GeV) makes\nthe axion rather light (\u223c 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22125 eV) and also very weakly coupled. The same (large) scale plays\na significant role in establishing the axion as a possible dark matter candidate, contributing significantly\nto the relic densities of cold dark matter. A much smaller value of fa , for instance, would diminish\nsignificantly the axion contribution to cold dark matter due to the suppression of its abundance (Y\u03c7 )\nwhich depends quadratically on fa .\nIt is quite immediate to realize that the gauging of the axionic symmetries by introducing a local\nanomalous U (1) - inherited from an underlying anomalous structure, i.e. a gauge anomaly - allows to\nleave the mass and the coupling of the axion to the gauge fields unrelated [26, 27], offering a natural\ntheoretical justification for the origin of axion-like particles. We just recall that effective low energy\nmodels incorporating gauged PQ interactions emerge in several string and supergravity constructions, for\ninstance in orientifold vacua of string theory and in gauged supergravities (see for instance [28, 29]).\nThe analysis that we perform in this work has the goal to capture the relevant phenomenological\nfeatures of the axions present in this class of models, extending a previous study presented in a nonsupersymmetric context [30]. We will be following, as in previous studies, a bottom-up approach. This\n2\n\n\fallows to identify the low energy effective action on the basis of a rather simple operatorial structure\ntypical of anomalous abelian models. The theory is then fixed by the condition of gauge invariance of the\nanomalous effective action, amended by operators of dimension-5 (Wess-Zumino or PQ-like terms) which\nappear in the action suppressed by a suitable scale, the St\u00fcckelberg mass (MSt ).\nThe introduction of the St\u00fcckelberg multiplet (or axion multiplet), while necessary for the restoration\nof gauge invariance, is in general expected to raise some concerns at cosmological level because of the\npresence, among its components, of a scalar modulus, the saxion. In supersymmetric (ordinary) PQ\nformulations this has a mass of the order of the weak scale or smaller and poses severe problems to the\nstandard cosmological scenario. A late time decay of this particle, for instance, could cause an entropy\nrelease with a low reheating temperature (TRH < 5 MeV) which is unacceptable for nucleosynthesis. Just\nfor comparison, we mention that in the case of string moduli, for instance, the interaction of these states\nwith the rest of the fields of the low energy spectrum is suppressed by the Planck scale. In turn, this\nforces the mass of these states to be quite large (100 TeV or so) [31, 32] in order to enhance the phase\nspace for their decay, for a similar reason.\nIn our construction the scalar modulus of the axion multiplet acquires a mass of the order of the\nSt\u00fcckelberg scale and has sizeable interactions with the other fields of the model, thereby decaying pretty\nfast (\u223c 10\u221223 s). Therefore, smaller values of its mass - in the TeV range - turn out to be compatible with\nthe standard scenario for nucleosynthesis.\n\n1.1\n\nThe USSM-A\n\nNon-supersymmetric versions of the class of models that we are going to analyze have been discussed in\ndetails in [33, 26, 27]. Recently [34, 35], an extension of a specific supersymmetric model, the USSM (the\nU (1)-extended Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model of [36]) has been presented, in which\nthe U (1) symmetry is anomalous. This model supports an axion-like particle in its spectrum. It has been\nnamed the \"USSM-A\", to recall both its supersymmetric origin and its anomalous abelian gauge structure.\nIt is also close to a similar U (1)\u2032 extension of the MSSM (the U (1)\u2032 Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel) [37], which supports an axino component among the interaction eigenstates of the neutralino\nsector, but not a gauged axion, due to the structure of the MSSM superpotential. The study of relic\ndensities in this model have been performed in [38, 39]. In the non-supersymmetric case the identification\nof a physical axion in the spectra of these models has been discussed in detail in [33], a realization called\n\"the Minimal Low Scale Orientifold Model\" or MLSOM for short.\nBoth in the USSM-A and in the model of [37], the extra U (1) symmetry takes an anomalous form and\nthe violation of gauge invariance requires supersymmetric PQ interactions, with a St\u00fcckelberg supermultiplet for the restoration of the gauge symmetry. The extra gauge boson of the anomalous U (1) symmetry\nis massive and in the St\u00fcckelberg phase, as in previous non-supersymmetric constructions [33, 26, 27]. As\nshown in the case of the MLSOM, axion-like particles appear in the CP-odd spectrum of these theories\nwhenever Higgs-axion mixing [33] occurs. For this reason in this work we will be using the term \"gauged\nsupersymmetric axion\" (or axi-Higgs, denoted equivalently as \u03c7 or H05 ) to refer to this state.\nAs we have mentioned in the introduction, we will follow a minimal approach. This approach allows\n3\n\n\fto define an effective theory on the basis of 1) an assigned gauge structure (the number of anomalous\nabelian interactions); 2) some conditions of anomaly cancellation and gauge invariance of the effective\nLagrangian; 3) the choice of a suitable value of the St\u00fcckelberg mass scale characterizing the range in\nwhich the description of these effective models is compatible with unitarity [40]. As in a previous analysis\nfor the LHC in the MLSOM [41], we will first stress on the general features of these models, deriving\nthe defining conditions for the counterterms which appear in the structure of the effective action, before\nmoving to a specific realization with a selected charge assignment. In our simulations we have found that\nthe dependence of the results on the choices of the independent charges is, however, extremely mild. In\nthis respect the properties that we are able to extrapolate from this class of models - even with a single\ncharge assignment - are pretty general and depend quite sensitively only on the choice of the St\u00fcckelberg\nmass MSt and the MSSM Higgs vev ratio tan \u03b2.\nIn this section we will focus on the axion/saxion Lagrangian, leaving a general discussion of the various\ncontributions to an appendix. It is given by\nLaxion/saxion = LSt + LW Z\n\n(1)\n\nwhere LSt is the supersymmetric version of the St\u00fcckelberg mass term [42], while LW Z denotes the WZ\ncounterterms responsible for the axion-like nature of the pseudoscalar b. Specifically\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nLSt =\nd4 \u03b8(b\u0302 + b\u0302\u2020 + 2MSt B\u0302)2\n2\n\u001a\u0014\nZ\n1\ncG\ncW\nLW Z = \u2212\nTr(GG)b\u0302 +\nTr(W W )b\u0302\nd4 \u03b8\n2\nMSt\nMSt\n\u0015\n\u001b\ncY\ncB\ncY B\nY\nY,\u03b1\nB\nB,\u03b1\nY\nB,\u03b1\n2\n+\nb\u0302W\u03b1 W\n+\nb\u0302W\u03b1 W\n+\nb\u0302W\u03b1 W\n\u03b4(\u03b8\u0304 ) + h.c. ,\n(2)\nMSt\nMSt\nMSt\nwhere we have denoted with G the supersymmetric field-strength of SU (3)c , with W the supersymmetric\nfield-strength of SU (2), with W Y and with W B the supersymmetric field-strength of U (1)Y and U (1)B\nrespectively. The Lagrangian LSt is invariant under the U (1)B gauge transformations\n\u03b4B B\u0302 =\u039b\u0302 + \u039b\u0302\u2020\n\u03b4B b\u0302 = \u2212 2MSt \u039b\u0302\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u039b\u0302 is an arbitrary chiral superfield. So the scalar component of b\u0302, that consists of the saxion and\nthe axion field, shifts under a U (1)B gauge transformation.\nThe coefficients cI \u2261 (cG , cW , cY , cB , cY B ) are dimensionless, fixed by the conditions of gauge invariance,\nand are functions of the free charges Bi of the model (as shown below in Eq.

Notice that these charges can be taken as fundamental\nparameters of the model. Their independent variation allows to scan the entire spectra of these models\nwith no reference to any specific construction. These relations appear in the anomalous variation (\u03b4B ) of\nthe supersymmetric 1-loop effective action of the model, which forces the introduction of supersymmetric\nPQ-like interactions (WZ terms) for its overall vanishing. Formally we have the relation\n\n\u03b4B (Bi )S1loop + \u03b4B (cI (Bi ))SW Z = 0,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the anomalous variation can be parameterized by the 4 charges Bi together with the coefficients\ncJ (Bi ) in front of the WZ counter-terms. In these notations, the uppercase index J runs over all the 5\nmixed-anomaly conditions B 3 , BY 2 , B 2 Y, BW 2 , BG2 , ordered from 1 to 5 (left to right).\nBefore coming to the definition of the charge assignments we pause for a remark. As we are going to show\nin the next sections, the scalar potential takes a nonlocal form unless all the anomaly coefficients in Eq. 5\nare zero. Such potential can however be expanded in powers of Reb/MSt , and as such these contributions\nturn out to be irrelevant if MSt is a very large scale. The situation is rather different if MSt is bound to\nlay around the 1 TeV region, where the potential could actually develope a singularity. In fact, in this\ncase, it is in general expected that a singular potential will soon dominate the dynamics of the model.\nWe will give the explicit expression of the D-terms for a general choice of the counterterms. The\nfunction (f ) which allows to identify all the charges in terms of the free ones is formally given by\nf (BQ , BL , BH1 , BS ) = (BQ , BUR , BDR , BL , BR , BH1 , BH2 , BS ).\n\n(7)\n\nThese depend only upon the 4 free parameters BQ , BL , BH1 and BS . In our analysis, the charges of\nEq. (7) have been assigned as\nf (2, 1, \u22121, 3) = (2, 0, \u22121, 1, 0, \u22121, \u22122, 3).\n\n(8)\n\nAs we have already mentioned, the dependence of our results on this choice of thi parametric charges\nis very small. Instead, as we will see, the relevant parameters of our analysis turn out to be: 1) the\nanomalous coupling of the gauge boson gB , which controls the decay rate of the saxion and of the axion\nand 2) the St\u00fcckelberg mass.\n5\n\n\f2\n\nAxions, saxions and all orders interactions\n\nThe contributions of the axion and saxion to the total Lagrangian are derived from the combination of\nthe St\u00fcckelberg and Wess-Zumino terms. The complete axion/saxion Lagrangian expressed in terms of\ncomponent fields is given by\nLaxion/saxion \u2261 LSt + LW Z\n\n(9)\n\nand contains a mixing among the D-terms which is rather peculiar, as we are going to show. The off-shell\nexpression of this Lagrangian is given by\nLaxion/saxion =\n\n1\n1\ni\ni\n(\u2202\u03bc Im b + Mst B\u03bc )2 + \u2202\u03bc Reb \u2202 \u03bc Reb + \u03c8b \u03c3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u0304b + \u03c8 \u0304b \u03c3\u0304 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8b + Fb\u2020 Fb + Laxion,i\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(10)\n\nwhere the expression of Laxion,i is quite lengthy and can be found in the appendix (Eq. (82)).\nThe equation of motion for the auxiliary field Fb can be derived quite immediately and give for the\nF \u2212term of the St\u00fcckelberg field the expression\nFb = \u2212\n\n1 cG a a\n1 cW i i\n1 cY\n1 cB\n1 cY B\n\u03bb\u0304 \u03bb\u0304 \u2212\n\u03bb\u0304 \u03bb\u0304 \u2212\n\u03bb\u0304Y \u03bb\u0304Y \u2212\n\u03bb\u0304B \u03bb\u0304B +\n\u03bb\u0304Y \u03bb\u0304B .\n16 MSt G G 16 MSt W W 2 MSt\n2 MSt\n2 MSt\n\n(11)\n\nOne important feature of the supersymmetric model is that b is a complex field with its real and imaginary\nparts. While Im b may appear in the CP-odd part of the scalar sector and undergoes mixing with the\nHiggs sector, its real part, Re b, the saxion (or scalar axion) before the EW symmetry breaking, has a\nmass exactly equal to the St\u00fcckelberg mass, as expected from supersymmetry. We just recall that in\nthe absence of SUSY breaking parameters, the components of the St\u00fcckelberg multiplet form, together\nwith the vector multiplet of the anomalous gauge boson, a massive vector multiplet of mass MSt . This\nis composed of the massive anomalous gauge boson, whose mass is given by the St\u00fcckelberg term, the\nmassive saxion and a massive Dirac fermion of mass MSt . The fermion is obtained by diagonalizing the\n2-dimensional mass matrix constructed in the basis of \u03bbB - the gaugino from the vector multiplet B\u0302 - and\n\u03c8b , which is the axino of the St\u00fcckelberg multiplet. The diagonalization of this matrix trivially gives two\nWeyl eigenstates of the same mass MSt , which can be assembled into a single massive Dirac fermion of\nthe same mass. Notice that in this re-identification of the degrees of freedom contained in b\u0302 and in the\nvector multiplet B\u0302, Im b takes the role of a Nambu-Goldstone mode and can be gauged away.\nThe saxion has typical interactions of the form Re b Fi Fj , with the gauge fields which have mixedanomalies with U (1)B , beside non-polynomial interactions with the remaining fields of the theory. As we\nare going to elaborate, this features shows up because of the presence of terms consisting of the product\nof two D fields and the saxion. To clarify this point, we recall that the general Lagrangian contains a\nsupersymmetric Wess-Zumino term of the form\nZ\n1\ncY\nLW Z,Y = \u2212\nb\u0302W Y\u03b1 W Y \u03b1 \u03b4(\u03b8\u0304 2 ) + h.c.\n(12)\nd4 \u03b8\n2\nMSt\nwhich gives, after the expansion in components, a term proportional to\ncY\nReb DY DY .\nMSt\n6\n\n(13)\n\n\fThis kind of terms, once that the equations of motion (EOM) of the auxiliary fields D are calculated and\nsubstituted back into the lagrangian, give the non-polynomial form of the potential. Furthermore, from\nthe WZ term corresponding to the anomaly BBY (which is the term proportional to cY B ), we get a term\nproportional to Reb DY DB so that the EOM for the abelian D fields are coupled.\nThe derivation of such equations involves all the terms of the Lagrangian discussed in appendix A.

An infinite number of additional higher order interactions\n(in powers of 1/MSt ) are generated by the insertion on these vertices of n powers of saxion lines. We use the double\nline notation for Majorana particles.\n\nthe problem of a possible late entropy release at that time. In this case one can essentially neglect the\nsaxion from the low energy spectrum. For moduli of string origin the required mass value (\u223c 100 TeV),\nmuch larger than in our case, is justified by the suppressed gravitational interaction of the modulus with\nthe rest of the matter fields and works as an enhancing factor for its decay. In our case, instead, such a\nsuppression is absent and a fast decay of the saxion is guaranteed already by a St\u00fcckelberg mass around\nthe TeV scale.\n\n8\n\n\f3\n\nThe scalar potential and the saxion\n\nAs we have mentioned, in this model there are three scalar fields which take a vev, H1 , H2 and S, the\nscalar components of the scalar superfield \u015c.

A numerical analysis of the Hessian at this point, for the selected parameters of the\nmodel used in our simulations, shows that indeed this extremal point indeed corresponds to a minimum.\nWe will try to highlight the most interesting features of these types of models and the implications\nfor the axion, which are all connected to the properties of the vacuum of these theories below the scale of\nSUSY breaking and at the scales of the electroweak and QCD phase transitions.\n9\n\n\f4\n\nSaxion decay modes\n\nHaving summarized the basic structure of the model, we now turn to describe the leading contributions\nto the 2-body decays of the saxion . The goal of this analysis is to ensure that the decay rate of the saxion\nis such that it occurs fast enough in order not to interfere with the nucleosynthesys.\nWe will compute its decay rate by considering the worst possible scenario, i.e. by assuming that this\ndecay occurs around the SUSY breaking scale, or temperature T around 1 TeV. At this temperature, the\ndecays of the saxion are parameterized by the typical SUSY breaking scales such as Mb and MY , both\nof O(Msusy ). The model is in a symmetric electroweak phase (Msusy > v), which justifies the use of the\ninteraction eigenstates (rather than the mass eigenstates) for the description of the final decay products.\nThe relevant interactions for the saxion decay are described by the general Lagrangian\nh\nLsaxiondec. =Re b gB MSt BH1 H1\u2020 H1 + gB MSt BH2 H2\u2020 H2 + gB MSt BS S \u2020 S+\ngB MSt BQ\n\n3\nX\n\nQ\u0303\u2020j Q\u0303j + gB MSt BDR\n\nj=1\n\ngB MSt BL\n\nX\n\n3\nX\n\n\u2020\nD\u0303R,j\nD\u0303R,j + gB MSt BUR\n\nj=1\n\nL\u0303\u2020l L\u0303l + gB MSt BR\n\nl=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\nX\n\n3\nX\n\n\u2020\n\u0168R,j\n\u0168R,j +\n\nj=1\n\nR\u0303l\u2020 R\u0303l\n\nl=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\n\u0015\n\u0001\n\u0001\ncY B\ncB\n\u2212i \u221a \u03bbB \u03c8b + \u03bb\u0304B \u03c8\u0304b \u2212 i \u221a \u03c8b \u03bbY + \u03c8\u0304b \u03bb\u0304Y .\n2 2\n2 2\n\n(19)\n\nThey involve CP-even and CP-odd massless scalars, the extra singlet scalar S, the squarks, the sleptons\nand the gauginos \u03c8b , \u03bbY .

For instance, for\ngB = 0.1 it decreases to \u223c 10\u221224 sec, since the phase space for the decay is considerably enhanced.\nWe conclude that the saxion decays sufficiently fast and does not generate any late entropy release at\nthe time of nucleosynthesis. Obviously, this scenario remains valid for all values of the St\u00fcckelberg mass\nabove the 1 TeV value. Therefore, in the analysis of the evolution of the contributions to the total energy\ndensity (\u03c1) of the universe, either due to matter (\u03c1m ) or to radiation (\u03c1R ), at temperatures T \u2264 2 TeV,\nthe contribution coming from the saxion is entirely accounted for by \u03c1R .\nAt this point, having cleared the way of any possible obstruction due to the presence of moduli at the\nlow energy stage (T \u2264 2 TeV) of the evolution of our model, we are ready to discuss the relevant features\nof the St\u00fcckelberg field. In particular, we will discuss the appearance of a physical axion, the physical\ncomponent of the St\u00fcckelberg, at the electroweak scale. This is extracted from the CP-odd sector and\ngenerated by the mechanism of vacuum misalignment taking place at the same scale. In particular, the\ndiscussion serves to illustrate how a flat - but physical - direction might be singled out from the vacuum\nmanifold, acquiring a small curvature at the electroweak phase transition.\n\n5\n\nThe flat direction of the physical axion from Higgs-axion mixing\n\nIn [34],[35] we have presented in some detail an approximate procedure in order to identify in the CP-odd\nsector one state that inherits axion-like interactions. The approach did not require the explicit expressions\nof the curvature terms in the CP-odd part of the supersymmetric potential, which are instead needed\nin the discussion of the angle of misalignment. Here we are going to extend this analysis by giving the\nexplicit parameterization of these additional terms. The determination of the angle of misalignment and\nits parameterization in terms of the physical axion is based on an extension of the method presented in\n[30]. We are going to illustrate this point starting, for simplicity, from the non-supersymmetric case and\nthen moving to the supersymmetric one.\n\n12\n\n\f5.1\n\nThe non-supersymmetric case\n\nIn the non-supersymmetric case the scalar sector contains two Higgs doublets VP Q (Hu , Hd ) plus one extra\ncontribution (a PQ breaking potential), denoted as VP/Q/ (Hu , Hd , b), which mixes the Higgs sector with\nthe St\u00fcckelberg axion b,\nV = VP Q (Hu , Hd ) + VP/Q/ (Hu , Hd , b).\n(28)\nThe mixing induced in the CP-odd sector determines the presence of a linear combination of the St\u00fcckelberg field b and of the Goldstones of the CP-odd sector, called \u03c7, which is characterized by an almost\nflat direction, whose curvature is controlled by the strength of the extra potential VP/Q/ . VP Q (Hu , Hd ) is\nthe ordinary potential of 2 Higgs doublets,\nVP Q = \u03bc2u Hu\u2020 Hu + \u03bc2d Hd\u2020 Hd + \u03bbuu (Hu\u2020 Hu )2 + \u03bbdd (Hd\u2020 Hd )2 \u2212 2\u03bbud (Hu\u2020 Hu )(Hd\u2020 Hd ) + 2\u03bb\u2032ud |HuT \u03c42 Hd |2\n(29)\nConcerning the VP/Q/ contribution to the total potential, its structure is inferred just on the basis of gauge\ninvariance and given by\n\u2212igB (BH2 \u2212BH1 ) 2Mb\n\nVP/Q/ =\u03bb0 (H2\u2020 H1 e\n\nSt\n\n\u2212igB (BH2 \u2212BH1 ) 2Mb\n\n) + \u03bb1 (H2\u2020 H1 e\n\n\u2212igB (BH2 \u2212BH1 ) 2Mb\n\n\u03bb2 (H2\u2020 H2 )(H2\u2020 H1 e\n\nSt\n\nSt\n\n)2 +\n\n\u2212igB (BH2 \u2212BH1 ) 2Mb\n\n) + \u03bb3 (H1\u2020 H1 )(H2\u2020 H1 e\n\nSt\n\n) + h.c.\n\n(30)\n\nThese terms are the only ones allowed by the symmetry of the model and are parameterized by one\ndimensionful (\u03bb0 \u2261 \u03bb\u03040 v) and three dimensionless constants (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 ).\nThe CP-odd sector is then spanned by the three fields (ImH1 , ImH2 , b), with the potential VP Q a\nfunction only of H1 and H2 . After electroweak symmetry breaking, due to Higgs-axion mixing, b can be\nwritten as a linear combination of a physical axion and of an extra component. The latter is a linear\ncombination of the two Goldstone modes of the total potential (VP Q + VP/Q/ ), denoted as G10 , G20 . The\nphysical axion, \u03c7, i.e. the component of b which is not proportional to the two Goldstones, can be identified\nusing the rotation matrix O \u03c7 which relates interaction and mass eigenstates in the CP-odd sector\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\nImH10\nG10\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 2\uf8f7\n\u03c7\uf8ec\n(31)\n\uf8edG0 \uf8f8 = O \uf8edImH20 \uf8f8 .\nb\n\n\u03c7\n\nwhich takes the form\n\n\u03c7\n\u03c7 1\n\u03c7 2\n\u03c7.\nb = O13\nG0 + O23\nG0 + O33\n\n(32)\n\n\u03c7 inherits WZ interactions from b via Eq. (32), once this is introduced into the WZ counterterms.\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\nFrom an explicit computation one finds that O13\n= 0, O23\n\u223c O(1) and O33\n\u223c v/MSt . The Goldstones\n1\nof the two neutral gauge bosons, GZ , GZ \u2032 are linear combinations of G0 and G20 and can be extracted\nfrom the bilinear mixings after an expansion around the broken electroweak vacuum. Then, the entire\nCP-odd sector can be spanned by the basis (GZ , GZ \u2032 , \u03c7). The presence of an extra degree of freedom in\nthis sector has been established in [33] using a simple counting of the degrees of freedom. We review this\npoint for clarity.\n13\n\n\fThere are 9 degrees of freedom in the set (AY , W3 , B, ImH1 , ImH2 ), where B is the massive St\u00fcckelberg\ngauge vector field, before electroweak symmetry breaking, as well as 9 in the set (A\u03b3 , Z, Z \u2032 , \u03c7), which is\ngenerated after the breaking. The direction determining the gauged axion \u03c7 is then physical but flat,\nin the absence of an extra potential which may depend explicitly on b. The potential V \u2032 is responsible\nfor giving a small mass for \u03c7 and can be used to parameterize the mechanism of vacuum misalignment\noriginated at the electroweak scale.\nOne can explore the structure of this potential and, in particular, investigate its periodicity. The\nphase of the potential is indeed parameterized by the ratio \u03c7/\u03c3\u03c7 [30]\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n2\n2\n2 2\nVP/Q/ =4v1 v2 \u03bb2 v1 + \u03bb3 v2 + \u03bb0 cos\n+ 2\u03bb1 v1 v2 cos 2\n(33)\n\u03c3\u03c7\n\u03c3\u03c7\n\nwith a mass for the physical axion \u03c7 given by\nm2\u03c7 =\n\n\u0001\n2v1 v2\n\u03bb\u03040 v 2 + \u03bb2 v12 + \u03bb3 v22 + 4\u03bb1 v1 v2 \u2248 \u03bbef f v 2 ,\n2\n\u03c3\u03c7\n\n(34)\n\nwith \u03c3\u03c7 \u223c O(v). The size of this expression is the result of two factors which appear in Eq. (34): the\nsize of the potential, parameterized by (\u03bb\u03040 , \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 ), and the electroweak vevs of the two Higgses. The\nappearance of \u03c7 in Eq. (33) - in the phase of the extra potential - shows explicitly that the angle of\nmisalignment is entirely described by this field. The angle is defined as\n\u03b8(x) \u2261\nwhere\n\u03c3\u03c7 \u2261 q\n\n\u03c7(x)\n,\n\u03c3\u03c7\n\n2v1 v2 MSt\n2 (B\n2\n2\n2\n2 2 2\ngB\nH2 \u2212 BH1 ) v1 v2 + 2MSt (v1 + v2 )\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\nis the new dimensionful constant which takes the same role of the scale fa of the PQ case (\u03b8(x) = a/fa ).\nThe potential is characterized by a small strength \u223c \u03bbef f v 4 , and for this reason one can think of \u03c7 as a\npseudo Nambu-Goldstone mode of the theory.\nAt this stage, it is important to realize that the size of the extra potential is significant in order\nto establish whether the degree of freedom associated to the axion field remains frozen or not at the\nelectroweak scale. For instance, if \u03bbef f is associated to electroweak instantons (\u03bbef f \u223c \u03bbinst ), then m\u03c7\nis very suppressed (see the discussion in Sec. 5.3) and far smaller than the corresponding Hubble rate at\nthe electroweak scale\nr\n1 4 3\nT2\nH(T ) =\n\u03c0 g\u2217,T\n(37)\n3 5\nMP\nwhich is about 10\u22125 eV. In the expression above g\u2217,Ti is the number of effective massless degrees of freedom\nof the model at a given temperature (T ), while MP denotes the Planck mass. We recall that the condition\nm\u03c7 (T ) \u223c 3H(T )\n\n(38)\n\nwhich ensures the presence of oscillations and determines implicitly the oscillation temperature Ti , is\nindeed impossible to satisfy if the misalignment that generates the value of m\u03c7 at the electroweak scale\n14\n\n\fis assumed of being of instanton origin (see the discussion in Appendix C). This implies that the degree\nof freedom associated to this physical axion would be essentially frozen at the electroweak scale, and\nthe oscillations could take place at a later stage in the early universe, only around the QCD hadron\ntransition. Instead, a more sizeable potential, providing an axion mass larger than 10\u22125 eV, would allow\nsuch oscillations. For an axion mass around 1 MeV oscillations indeed occur, but are damped by the\nparticle decay, given that its lifetime (\u03c4l \u223c 10\u22124 sec) is much larger than period of their oscillation (\n\u03c4osc \u223c 10\u221213 sec). This discussion is going to be expanded to the supersymmetric case.\n\n5.2\n\nSupersymmetry and the angle of misalignment\n\nIn the supersymmetric case the situation is analogous, in the sense that the physical direction \u03c7 can be\nidentified by the same criteria. The superpotential that we are considering allows the presence of one extra\ndegree of freedom, given by Im S, to appear in the CP-odd sector besides the states (Im H1 , Im H2 , Im b),\nalready present in the non-supersymmetric case.\nFrom the supersymmetric potential V in (16), we identify two massless states, that we call G01 and\nG02 , and a massive eigenstate, called H40 . G01 and G02 do not coincide with the true Goldstones of the\nmodel, as in the previous case, since the V potential does not include any contribution involving Im b.\nThe correct neutral Goldstone modes are extracted from the derivative couplings between the CP-odd\nscalar fields and the neutral gauge bosons present in the Lagrangian. The physical axion is then identified\nas the massless direction which is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by (GZ , GZ \u2032 , H40 ). This state is\ncalled H05 \u2261 \u03c7 and is given by the linear combination\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nMst v1 v22 ImH10 + MSt v12 v2 ImH20 \u2212 Mst v 2 vS Im S \u2212 BS gB (v 2 vS2 + v12 v22 )Im b\nN\u03c7\nq\n2 v 2 (v 2 v 2 + v 2 v 2 ) + B 2 g 2 (v 2 v 2 + v 2 v 2 )2 .\nN\u03c7 = MSt\n1 2\n1 2\nS\nS B\nS\n\n\u03c7=\n\n(39)\n\nIt is important to remark that this state is not constructed, at least at this stage, from the matrix O \u03c7 ,\nsince the projection of Im b on \u03c7 would be zero, if the matrix O\u03c7 were derived just from the potential V\nsince it does not depend on Im b.\nAlso in this case, the identification of the Goldstones of the two neutral massive gauge bosons (Z and Z \u2032 )\nis obtained by looking at the bilinear mixing terms; these appear in the Lagrangian once this is rewritten\nin the physical basis (in the form MZ Z\u2202GZ , and MZ \u2032 Z \u2032 \u2202GZ \u2032 ). Then one can immediately figure out\nthat the linear basis spanning the entire CP-odd sector can be completed by the addition of an extra,\northogonal state \u03c7 (GZ , GZ \u2032 , H40 , \u03c7). The new entry parameterizes a massless but physical direction in\nthis sector. Once Im b is re-expressed in terms of the physical axion \u03c7 and of the Goldstone modes GZ , GZ \u2032\nof the massive gauge bosons, \u03c7 will inherit from Im b axion-like interactions and will be promoted to a\ngeneralized PQ axion.\nAt this point, having identified this flat but physical direction of the potential in the CP-odd sector,\none can ask the obvious question whether the same potential can acquire a curvature. These effects are\nindeed parameterized by the strength (\u03bbef f ) of the potential V \u2032 (the \"extra potential\") that we are going\nto identify below, and which remains a free parameter in the theory.\n15\n\n\fOne special comment is deserved by vS , the vev of the scalar singlet, which is new compared to\nthe standard MSSM scenario and which is part of the scalar potential. We recall that this new scale\nis essentially bound by the condition \u03bbvS \u223c \u03bc \u223c 102 \u2212 103 GeV (see Eq. 78). This defines the typical\nrange for the \u03bc term, which sets the scale of the interaction for the two Higgs doublets in supersymmetric\ntheories.\nIn our case we are allowed to parameterize this new non-perturbative contribution (V \u2032 ) to the potential,\nas discussed in the previous section, in a rather straightforward way, by classifying all the phase-dependent\noperators which can be constructed using the fundamental fields of the model. In analogy to the nonsupersymmetric case (the MLSOM) [33] we rely only on gauge invariance as a guiding principle to identify\nthem. These include, in particular, a dependence of V \u2032 , again in the form of a phase factor, from the\nSt\u00fcckelberg field Im b.\nThe contributions appearing in V \u2032 don't need to be given necessarily in a supersymmetric form, since\nwe are assuming that supersymmetry is already broken at the scale at which they appear (v < Msusy ).\nThey are parameterized in the form\n6\nX\nVi\n(40)\nV\u2032 =\ni=1\n\nwhere\n\nImb\n\u2212i4gB BS 2M\n\nV1 = a1 S 4 e\n\nSt + h.c.\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212ig B Imb\nV2 = e B S 2MSt a2 H1 * H2 S 2 + b2 H1\u2020 H1 S + b3 H2\u2020 H2 S + b4 S \u2020 S 2 + d1 S + h.c.\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2212ig 2B Imb\nV3 = e B S 2MSt a3 H1\u2020 H1 S 2 + a4 H2\u2020 H2 S 2 + a5 S \u2020 S 3 + c1 S 2 + h.c.\nImb\nigB 2BS 2M\n\nV4 = a6 (H1 * H2 )2 e\n\nImb\n\u2212igB 3BS 2M\nSt\n\nV5 = b1 S 3 e\n\nSt\n\n+ h.c.\n\nImb\nigB BS 2M\n\nV6 = c2 H1 * H2 e\n\n+ h.c.\n\nSt\n\n+ h.c..\n\n(41)\n\nIn the expressions above we have grouped together terms that share the same phase factor.

(41), and recompute the CP-odd mass matrix using the new\npotential (V + V \u2032 ), this gets modified, but we still find two massless eigenstates corresponding to the\nneutral Goldstone modes, which also in this case we call G10 and G20 . They can be expressed as linear\ncombinations of the neutral Goldstone states coming from the derivative couplings between the gauge\nbosons and the CP-odd Higgs fields. An important point to remark is that these states (Goldstone\nmodes) do not depend on the parameters of the Peccei-Quinn breaking potential, as we expect, since the\npresence of this extra potential doesn't affect the bilinear derivative couplings through which they are\nidentified.\n16\n\n\fIn the basis (ImH11 , ImH22 , ImS, Imb) they are given by\n\u001a\n\u001b\nv1 \u2212v2\n1\nG0 =\n,\n, 0, 0\nv v\n\u001a\n\u001b\nv12 v2\nv1 v22\n1\n2\ngB BS 2 , gB BS 2 , \u2212gB BS vS , MSt .\nG0 = q\nv\nv\n2 + g 2 (B 2 v 2 + B 2 v 2 + B 2 v 2 )\nMSt\n1\n2\nB\nH1\nH2\nS S\n\n5.3\n\n(43)\n\nThe strength of the potential and \u03bbef f\n\nOne important comment concerns the possible size of the axion mass m\u03c7 induced by V \u2032 at the electroweak\nscale. In this respect we will take into account two basic possibilities. A first possibility that we will explore\nis to assume that the axion mass is PQ-like, in the milli-eV region; as a second possibility we will select an\naxion mass around the MeV region. These choices cover a region of parameter space that has never been\nanalyzed in these types of models, while a study of the GeV region for the axion mass has been addressed\nbefore in [41]. These choices have to be confronted with constraints coming from a) direct axion searches,\nb) nucleosynthesys constraints and c) constraints on the relic densities from WMAP data.\nA PQ-like axion is bound to emerge in the spectrum of the theory if the potential V \u2032 is strongly\nsuppressed and the real mechanism of misalignment which determines its mass is the one taking place\nat the QCD transition. The value of \u03bbef f , under these assumptions, should be truly small and one\nway to achieve this would be to attribute its origin to electroweak instantons. Using the numerical\nrelations for the electromagnetic (\u03b1) and weak couplings (\u03b1W ), 1/\u03b1(MZ ) = 128 and \u03b1W = \u03b1/ sin2 \u03b8W\nwith sin2 \u03b8W (MZ ) = 0.23 on the Z mass (\u03b1W (MZ ) = 0.034), the exponential suppression of the extra\npotential is controlled by \u03bbef f \u223c e\u2212185 \u2261 \u03bbinst = 4.5 \u00d7 10\u221281 . This corresponds to a mass for the axion\np\ngiven by m\u03c7 \u223c \u03bbef f v \u223c 10\u221229 eV. This mass would be obviously redefined at the QCD epoch.\nAs we have briefly mentioned in the introduction, mass values of the axion field around 10\u221233 eV (for\nglobal U (1)'s or of PQ type) and with a spontaneous breaking scale fa \u223c 1018 eV have been considered\n\u00014\nas a possible origin of a cosmological constant \u039b4 \u223c 10\u22123 eV [11]. In such models the misalignment is\npurely of electroweak origin and connected to electroweak instantons. Oscillations of fields of such a mass\nwould not take place even at the current cosmological time.\nInstead, for an axion of a mass in the MeV region, the value of \u03bbef f is larger (\u223c 10\u221212 ) and will\nbe estimated below. In this case the effect of vacuum misalignment at the QCD scale is irrelevant in\ndetermining the mass of this particle. A more massive axion, in fact, decays at a much faster rate than\na very light one and the usual picture typical of a long-lived PQ-like axion, in this specific case, simply\ndoes not apply.\nIn order to characterize in more detail the potential in Eq. (40), we proceed with a careful analysis\nof the field dependence of the phase factors in the exponentials, that we expect to be written exclusively\nin terms of the physical fields of the CP odd sector, H04 , and the axion \u03c7 (\u03c7 \u2261 H05 ). In fact, this is the\nanalogous (and a generalization) of what found in the previous section (see Eq. (33)), where the periodicity\nhas been shown to depend only on the axion \u03c7. For this purpose we use the following parameterization\n\n17\n\n\fof the fields\n\u0001 1\n1\n1\n2\nH11 (x) = \u221a \u03c111 (x) + v1 ei\u03a61 (x) H12 (x) = \u221a \u03c121 (x)ei\u03a61 (x)\n2\n2\n\u0001 2\n1\n1\n1\nH21 (x) = \u221a \u03c112 (x)ei\u03a62 (x) H22 (x) = \u221a \u03c122 (x) + v2 ei\u03a62 (x)\n2\n2\n1\nS(x) = \u221a (\u03c1S (x) + vS ) ei\u03a6S (x)\n2\n\n(44)\n\nand select just some of the Vi in Eq. (41) in order to illustrate the general behaviour.\nFor instance, if we consider only the V1 term we get the corresponding symmetric mass matrix for the\ntotal potential V + V1 , with V defined in Eq.

(35), with \u03c3H04 and \u03c3H05 defining, separately, the scales of the two angular contributions to the total\nphase. It is not difficult to show that the periodicity of the potential depends predominantly on H04 . This\ncan be easily seen by analyzing the size of \u03c3H04 and \u03c3H05 .

Clearly,\n\u03c3H05 \u226b \u03c3H04 , but the dependence of the extra potential on \u03c7 is clearly affected by the different possible\nsizes of \u03bbef f . For an instanton generated potential (\u03bbef f \u223c \u03bbinst ) the direction of \u03c7 is essentially flat\nand \u03c3H05 turns out to be very large. In turn, this implies that the dependence of the potential V1 on H05 ,\nwhich takes place exclusively through the exponential, is negligible, being essentially controlled by H04\n(\u03b81 \u223c H04 /v) with\nV1 \u223c \u03bbef f v 4 cos(\u03b81 ).\n\n(51)\n\nWe may conclude, indeed, that in this case the effect of misalignment on \u03c7, generated at the electroweak\nscale, can be neglected. This feature is shown on the left panel of Fig. 4, where we plot V \u2032 (H04 , \u03c7). It is\nimmediately clear from these plots that for \u03bbef f \u223c \u03bbinst the only periodicity of the extra potential is in\nthe variable H04 (left panel), due to the flatness of the H05 direction. For a more sizeable potential, with\n\u03bbef f \u223c 10\u221212 , the curvature generated in \u03c7 is responsible for giving a mass to the axion in the MeV range\n(Fig. 4, right panel).

In the non-supersymmetric case the periodicity of the potential is controlled by the weak scale (v),\nand is expressed directly in terms of the physical component of b (which is a real field).

In the\nsupersymmetric case we can think of the periodicity in Eq. (53) as essentially controlled by the massive CPodd Higgs H04 , with a period which is O(\u03c0vS ), with superimposed a second periodicity of O(\u03c0Msusy /\u03bbef f )\n(with Msusy /\u03bbef f \u226b vS ) in the perpendicular direction (\u03c7). We conclude that the actual structure of\nthe complete (V + V \u2032 ) potential indeed guarantees the presence in the spectrum of a physical and light\npseudoscalar field. This analysis holds, in principle, for an axion of any mass, although we do not explicitly\nstudy an axion whose mass goes beyond the MeV region. To have an axion which is long-lived, the true\ndiscriminant of our study is the axion mass, and for this reason we are going to present a study of the\ndecay rates of this particle keeping the mass as a free parameter varying in the milli-eV - MeV interval.\n\n6\n\nDecay of a gauged supersymmetric axion\n\nIn this section we compute the decay rate of the axion of the supersymmetric model into two-photons,\nmediated both by the direct PQ interaction and by the fermion loop, which are shown in Fig. 5, keeping\nthe axion mass as a free parameter.

In order to\nhave an acceptable Higgs spectrum, the Yukawa couplings have been set to give the right fermion masses\nof the Standard Model, while for gB and BS we have chosen gB = 0.1 and BS = 4.\nWe show in Figs. 6 and 7 results obtained from the numerical evaluation of the decay amplitude as\na function of the mass of the axion m\u03c7 , which clearly indicates that the decay rates are very small for\na milli-eV particle, although larger than those of the PQ case [30]. We conclude that a PQ-like axion is\nindeed long-lived also in these models and as such could, in principle, contribute to the relic densities of\ndark matter. For an axion with a mass in the MeV region, instead, the particle is not stable and as such\nwould decay rather quickly. The decay, in this case, is fast enough (\u03c4 . 10\u22123 sec) and does not interfere\nwith the nucleosynthesis.\n\n7\n\nCold dark matter by misalignment of the axion field\n\nIn the case of a long-lived axion, the generation of relic densities of axion dark matter, in this model,\ninvolves two (sequential) misalignments, generated, as we have already discussed, the first at the electroweak scale, and the second at the QCD phase transition. The presence of two misalignments at two\nseparate scales, as discussed in [30], is typical of axions which show interactions both with the weak and\nwith the strong sectors, due to the presence of mixed anomalies. This point has been addressed in detail\nwithin a non-supersymmetric model, but in a supersymmetric scenario the physical picture remains the\nsame.\n22\n\n\fMSt = 1 TeV\n\ntan\u03b2 = 35\n\nvS = .5 TeV\n1e+35\n\n1e-35\n\n1e+30\n\n1e-40\n\n1e+25\n\u03c4\u03c7\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 (s)\n\n\u0393\u03c7\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 (GeV)\n\nvS = .5 TeV\n1e-30\n\n1e-45\n\ntan\u03b2 = 35\n\n1e+20\n\n1e-50\n\n1e+15\n\n1e-55\n\n1e+10\n\n1e-60\n1e-12 1e-11 1e-10 1e-09 1e-08 1e-07 1e-06 1e-05 1e-04 0.001\nm\u03c7(MeV)\n\nMSt = 1 TeV\n\n100000\n1e-12 1e-11 1e-10 1e-09 1e-08 1e-07 1e-06 1e-05 1e-04 0.001\nm\u03c7(MeV)\n\nFigure 6: Decay amplitude (left panel) and mean lifetime (right panel) for \u03c7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 as a function of the axi-Higgs\nmass.\n\nIn the PQ-like case, at the first misalignment, taking place at the electroweak scale, the physical axion\nis singled out as a component of Im b, with a mass which is practically zero, due to the small value of the\ncurvature induced by the potential generated by electroweak instantons (Fig. 3, top) given in Eq. (40). In\nthe case of a very small extra potential (\u03bbef f \u223c \u03bbinst ) it is the second misalignment to be responsible for\ngenerating an axion mass. At the second misalignment, taking place at the QCD phase transition, the\nmass of this pseudo Nambu-Goldstone mode is redefined from zero to a small but more significant value\n(\u223c 10\u22123 eV) induced by the QCD instantons ((Fig. 3, bottom). The final value of the mass is determined\n2 /v, which replaces f in all\nin terms of the hadronic scale \u039bQCD and of a second intermediate scale, MSt\na\nof the expressions usually quoted in the literature and held valid for PQ axions, as we are now going to\nclarify.\n\u2022 MeV axion\nAn MeV axion is allowed only if the extra potential (the misalignment) is assumed to be generated at a\nscale different from the electroweak phase transition, say at an earlier time. This misalignment, in fact,\nshould be unrelated to the (quasi-periodic) corrections induced at the electroweak time, as shown in Fig.\n4, being the latter of very small size. However, such an axion would not be long lived. One can easily\nrealize that in this scenario, due to the sizeable value of m\u03c7 , there is an overlap between the period of\ncoherent oscillations at the QCD hadron transition and the typical lifetime at which the axion decays.\nThis can be trivially checked by comparing the QCD time, defined as the inverse Hubble rate at the\ntemperature of confinement (H(TQCD ) \u223c 10\u221211 eV, TQCD \u223c 200 MeV) tQCD \u223c 10\u22124 sec with the axion\nlifetime in this typical mass range.\n\u2022 PQ-like axion\n2 /v) is the result of the product of two factors: a first factor\nFor a PQ-like axion the effective scale (MSt\ndue to the rotation matrix of the St\u00fcckelberg field Im b onto \u03c7 - which is proportional to v/M - times a\n\n23\n\n\fsecond factor (1/MSt ) which is inherited from the original Im b/MSt F F\u0303 (WZ) counterterm.

(39), the size of the projection of Im b into \u03c7 is given by\n1\nBS gB (v 2 vS2 + v12 v22 ) \u223c v/MSt\nN\u03c7\n\n(63)\n\nand hence a typical PQ interaction term involving the St\u00fcckelberg field b becomes\n\u03c7\nIm b\nF F \u2032 \u2192 2 F F \u2032.\nMSt\nMSt /v\n\n(64)\n\nThe physical state with a b component (i.e. \u03c7) acquires an interaction to F F\u0303 which is suppressed by the\n2 /v.\nscale MSt\nHaving identified this scale, if we neglect the axion mass generated by V \u2032 (Eq. 40) at the electroweak\nscale, the final mass of the physical axion induced at the QCD scale is controlled by the ratio m\u03c7 \u223c\n2 , where the angle of misalignment is given by \u03b8 \u2032 = \u03c7v/M 2 .\n\u039b2QCD v/MSt\nSt\nComing to the value of the abundances for a PQ-like axion - defined as the number density to entropy\nratio Y = n\u03c7 /s - these can be computed in terms of the relevant suppression scale appearing in the \u03c7F F\u0303\ninteraction. We have expanded on the structure of the computation in Appendix C. If we indicate with\n\u03b8 \u2032 (Ti ) the angle of misalignment at the QCD hadron transition and with Ti the initial temperature at the\nbeginning of the oscillations, the expression of the abundances takes the form\nY\u03c7 (Ti ) =\n\n\u0012\n\nv\nMSt\n\n\u0013\n\n2 (\u03b8 \u2032 (T ))2\n45MSt\ni\np\n,\n2 5\u03c0g\u2217,T Ti MP\n\n(65)\n\nwhich depends linearly on MSt . As we have already mentioned, the computation of the relic densities for\na non-thermal population follows rather closely the approach outlined in the non-supersymmetric case.\nFor instance, a rather large value of MSt , of the order of 107 GeV [30], determines a sizeable contribution\nof the gauged axion to the relic densities of cold dark matter. These, in turn, follow rather closely the\nbehaviour expected in the case of the PQ axion. In practice, to obtain a sizeable non-thermal populations\n2 /v \u223c f , with f the usual estimated size of the PQ\nof gauged axions, MSt should be such that MSt\na\na\naxion decay constant. This allows a sizeable contribution of \u03c7 to the relic density of cold dark matter,\nwith a partial contribution to \u03a9 (\u03a9\u03c7 h2 \u223c 0.1) in close analogy to what expected in the case of the PQ\naxion. These considerations, which are in close relations with what found in the non-supersymmetric\nconstruction [30], in this case will be subject to the constraints coming from the neutralino sector and\nits abundances derived from WMAP. We will come back to this point after presenting the results of our\nsimulations in the next sections.\n\n8\n\nThe neutralino sector\n\nThe neutralino sector is constructed from the eigenstates of the space spanned by the neutral fields (i\u03bbW 3 ,\ni\u03bbY , i\u03bbB , H \u030311 , H \u030322 , S\u0303, \u03c8b ), which involve the three neutral gauginos, the two Higgsinos, the singlino (the\nfermion component of the singlet superfield) and the axino component of the St\u00fcckelberg supermultiplet.\n24\n\n\fMSt = 1 TeV\n\ntan\u03b2 = 35\n\nvS = .5 TeV\n10\n\n1e-21\n\n1\n\n1e-22\n\n0.1\n\n\u03c4\u03c7\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 (s)\n\n\u0393\u03c7\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 (GeV)\n\nvS = .5 TeV\n1e-20\n\n1e-23\n\n1e-24\n\nMSt = 1 TeV\n\ntan\u03b2 = 35\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n1e-25\n\n1e-04\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n1.2\nm\u03c7(MeV)\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n1.2\nm\u03c7(MeV)\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\nFigure 7: Decay amplitude and mean lifetime for \u03c7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 as a function of the axi-Higgs mass for an axion whose\nmass in the MeV range.\n\nWe denote with M\u03c70 the corresponding mass matrix and we list its components in the appendix. The\nneutralino eigenstates of this mass matrix are labelled as \u03c7\u03030i (i = 0, . . . , 6) and can be expressed in the\nbasis {i\u03bbW3 , i\u03bbY , i\u03bbB , H\u030311 , H\u030322 , S\u0303, \u03c8b }\n\u03c7\u03030i = ai1 i\u03bbW3 + ai2 i\u03bbY + ai3 i\u03bbB + ai4 H\u030311 + ai5 H\u030322 + ai6 S\u0303 + ai7 \u03c8b .\n\n(66)\n\nThe neutralino mass eigenstates are ordered in mass and the lightest eigenstate corresponds to i = 0. We\n0\nindicate with O \u03c7 the rotation matrix that diagonalizes the neutralino mass matrix. In order to perform\na numerical analysis of the model we need to fix some of the parameters, first of all requiring consistency\nof their choice with the masses of the Standard Model particles. For this purpose, the Higgs vev's v1\nand v2 have been constrained in order to generate the correct mass values of the W \u00b1 , which depends on\nv 2 = v12 + v22 , and of the Z gauge boson.\nThe Yukawa couplings have been fixed in order to give the correct masses of the SM fermions. The\nchoice of vS and of the parameter \u03bb in the trilinear term \u03bbSH1 * H2 in the scalar potential has been made\nin order to obtain mass values in the Higgs sector in agreement with the limits from direct searches (with\n\u03bb \u223c O(1)). For this reason we have selected the value \u03bb = 0.5 and the assignment BH1 = \u22121, BS = 3 for\nthe U (1)B charges of the Higgs and the singlet; BQ = 2 for the quark doublet, and BL = 1 for the lepton\ndoublet. The gauge mass terms parameters have been selected according to the relation\nMY : MW : MG = 1 : 2 : 6,\n\n(67)\n\ncoming from the unification condition for the gaugino masses. As a further simplification, the sfermion\nmass parameters ML , MQ , mR , mD and mU have been set to a unique value M0 . We have also chosen\na common value a0 for the trilinear couplings ae ,ad and au . With these choices, besides tan \u03b2, the only\nother free parameters left are the St\u00fcckelberg mass MSt , the gaugino mass term for \u03bbB , denoted by MB ,\n\n25\n\n\fand the axino mass term, Mb . Our choices are the following\nMY = 500GeV\n\nMY B = 1 TeV\n\nMW = 1 TeV\n\nMG = 3 TeV\n\nML = MQ = mR = mD = mU = M0 = 1 TeV\nae = ad = au = a0 = 1 TeV\na\u03bb = \u2212100 GeV,\n\n(68)\n\nwhere with ML and MQ we have denoted the scalar mass terms for the sleptons and the squarks, assumed\nto be equal for all the 3 generations. We have also chosen\nMB = Mb = 1 TeV\n\n(69)\n\nwith a coupling constant gB of the anomalous U (1) of 0.4. From previous investigations such values of the\nanomalous coupling are known to be compatible with LEP data at the Z resonance [43, 44]. In particular,\nthe mass of the extra Z \u2032 (MZ \u2032 ), which in our case is of the order of the St\u00fcckelberg mass, MZ \u2032 \u223c MSt\n[43], due to the region of variability of MSt that we investigate in our simulations, obviously satisfies the\ncurrent LHC constraints at 95% CL ( > 1140 GeV) from CMS [45] and from ATLAS (> 1.83 TeV) [46]\non the absence of a resonance in the dilepton channel at 7 TeV for an extra Z prime with Standard-Model\nlike couplings. This parameter choice is our benchmark, which is compatible with all the SM requirements\non the spectrum of the known particles. It involves SUSY breaking scales in a kinematical range which is\nunder investigation at the LHC. We also assume a value vb = 20 GeV for the vev of the saxion field Reb.\nThe most significant parameters in the relic density calculation are MSt and the Higgs vev ratio tan \u03b2.\nConcerning the St\u00fcckelberg mass, its value has been chosen to be varied in two different regions, 2 \u2212 10\nTeV and 11 \u2212 25 TeV. In both regions we will consider different values of tan \u03b2.\n\n9\n\nNeutralino relic densities and cosmological bounds\n\nAs it is well known, the evaluation of the relic densities requires the calculation of a great number of\nthermally averaged cross sections, given the number of particles which are present. Before coming to the\ndiscussion of the results of this very involved analysis, which is summarized just in some simple plots of\nthe relic densities of the lightest neutralino - as a function both of MSt and tan \u03b2, - we present a general\ndescription of the structure of the interactions in the model. We also list the 2-to-2 processes that have\nbeen considered in the coupled Boltzmann equations.\nWe start from the action involving the physical axion (H05 ) and its interactions with the various sectors.\n5\nThese involve, typically, interactions with the Higgs sector via bilinear vertices (proportional to RH0 HH ),\n5\nand trilinear ones (proportional to RH0 HHH ) in H, with H denoting generically CP-even and CP-odd\nHiggs eigenstates. Other interactions in the same component of the Lagrangian involve axion-neutralino\n5 0 0\n5 \u00b1 \u2213\nterms (RH0 \u03c7i \u03c7j ) plus axion-charginos (RH0 \u03c7i \u03c7j ). Other terms are those involving interactions of the\n5 \u2020\n5 \u2020\naxion with the sleptons (RH0 l\u0303i l\u0303j ) and the squarks (RH0 q\u0303i q\u0303j ); vertices involving gauge bosons (for instance\n\u00b1 \u2213\n5\nRH0 A\u03c7i \u03c7j , with a photon A and two charginos) and quartic contributions with 2, 3 and 4 axion lines.\n26\n\n\fH05\n\nH05\n\nH05\n\ng\n\nH\u2213\n\nH05\n\nH05 , H04\n\n\u03c7\u00b1\ni\n\n\u03c70i\n\n\u03b3, Z, Z \u2032 /W \u00b1\nH0i\n\nH05\n\n\u03c7\u2213\nj\n\n\u03c70j\n\n\u03b3, Z, Z \u2032 /W \u2213\n\ng\n\nW\u00b1\n\nq\u0303i\n\nA, Z, Z \u2032\n\n\u03c7\u2213\nj\n\nW+\n\n\u03c7\u2212\nj\n\nq\u0303j\n\nH05\n\n\u03c7\u00b1\ni\n\nH05\n\n\u03c7i\n\nH05\n\nH05 , H04\nH05\n\n\u03c7\u00b1\n\nH05 , H04\n\nH0i\n\nH05 , H04\n\nH05 , H04\n\nH04\n\n\u03c70i\n\n\u03c70i\n\nH\u2213\n\nH05\n\nH0j\n\nH05\n\nH05 , H04\n\nH05\n\n\u03c70j\n\nFigure 8: Axi-Higgs (H05 ) interactions.

The same package allows to generate the CalcHEP[48] model files which are\nneeded by micrOMEGAs[49] for the calculation of the scattering cross section that are required in the\nrelic density calculation.\nWith our choice for the parameters the lightest neutralino is the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle\n(LSP) and so it is the dark matter component in our simulations. The value of the neutralino mass in this\ncase turns out to be around 23 GeV with a rather mild dependence on tan \u03b2. For tan \u03b2 varying between\n5 and 25 the neutralino mass varies from 22.4 to 23.8 GeV.\nWe show in Tab. 1 a list of the most relevant 2-to-2 processes which are generated in the s, t and\nu channels having neutralinos in the initial state (in), while the possible final states are shown on the\nright-hand side of the same table (out).\nIn Fig. 10 we show the results obtained for the lightest neutralino relic density with MSt in the range\n5\u22128 TeV, vS = 600 GeV and a varying tan \u03b2. The values of vS , tan \u03b2 and MSt for which we plot the result\ncoming from the relic density calculation are those that give also acceptable mass values for the whole\nspectrum, in particular for the neutral Higgs (\u223c 124 \u2212 126 GeV) [50, 51].

Once again these values are such that we obtain acceptable values for the masses of all the particles\nin the model. One can immediately notice that for a fixed value of tan \u03b2 as we increase MSt , the relic\ndensities grow and tend to violate the WMAP bound. This trend has been found over a sizable range of\nvariability of tan \u03b2 and is a central feature of the model. It is then obvious, from the same figures, that\nit is possible to raise the Stuckelberg mass and stay below the bound if, at the same time, we increase\ntan \u03b2.\n\n10\n\nSummary: windows on the axion mass\n\nAt this point, before coming to our conclusions, we can try to gather all the information that we have\nobtained so far in the previous sections, summarizing the basic properties of axions in these types of\nmodels.\n\u2022 The milli-eV (PQ-like) axion\nOne possibility that we have explored in this work is that V \u2032 , the extra potential which is periodic in the\naxion field, may be generated around the TeV scale or at the electroweak phase transition. The actual\nstrength of the potential, remains, in our construction, undetermined and the physical features of the axion\n(primarily its mass), depend upon this parameter. We have tried to describe the various possibilities, in\n29\n\n\f0.130\n\ntan\u03b2 \u03a95\ntan\u03b2 \u03a910\ntan\u03b2 \u03a915\ntan\u03b2 \u03a920\ntan\u03b2 \u03a925\ntan\u03b2 \u03a930\ntan\u03b2 \u03a935\n\n0.125\n0.120\n\n\u03a9 h2\n\n0.115\n0.110\n0.105\n0.100\n0.095\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nMSt(TeV)\n\n20\n\n22\n\nFigure 11: Relic density of the lightest neutralino as a function of the St\u00fcckelberg mass in the region 2 \u2212 24 TeV\nfor different values of the Higgs vev ratio tan \u03b2\n\nthis respect, and the essential features for each choice for the value of the mass. In particular, if the extra\npotential is generated by non-perturbative effects at the electroweak phase transition, then the mass of\nthe axion is tiny and the true mechanism of misalignment which determines its mass takes place at a\nsecond stage, at the QCD phase transition. In this case the physical axion of the model would be no much\ndifferent from an ordinary PQ axion and would be rather long-lived. At the same time, its abundances\n2 /v, which should be rather large (\u223c 1010 \u2212 1012 GeV),\nare fixed by the possible value of the scale MSt\nof the same order of fa in typical axion models, to be a significant component of cold dark matter. In\nthe region that we have analyzed numerically, with MSt around the 2-20 TeV's, the contribution to dark\nmatter from misalignment of the axion field, in this case, should be small.\nA second important constraint on this particle, in this mass range, comes from direct axion searches,\nwhich also requires the interaction of the axions with the gauge fields (in particular the photon) to be\nsuppressed by a large fa . For this reason, with MSt in the TeV region, these simulations indicate that an\naxion of this mass, in fact, can be excluded by typical searches with detectors of Sikivie type. The reason\nis rather obvious, since axions in the milli-eV mass range could be copiously produced at the center of the\nsun and probably should have been seen by now in ground based detectors (helioscopes), such as CAST\n[53]. We recall that one of the goals of searches with helioscopes is to set a lower bound on the suppression\nscale fa of the axion-photon vertex, which is currently experimentally constrained, as we have already\nmentioned, to be rather large.\n\u2022 The meV axion\n30\n\n\fA second possibility that we have investigated is that the extra potential appearing in the CP-odd sector is\nunrelated to instanton corrections in the electroweak vacuum. In this case the mass of the axion remains\na free parameter. The range that we have explored in this second case involves an axion mass in the\nMeV region, discussing the several constraints that emerge from the model. In this case the axion is, in\ngeneral, not long-lived and as such is not a component of dark matter. On the other hand, the constraints\nfrom CAST can be avoided, since the particle would not be produced by ordinary thermal mechanisms\nat the center of the sun, where the temperature is about 1.7 keV, being its mass above the keV range.\nObviously, in this case other constraints emerge from nucleosynthesis requirements, since a particle in this\nmass range has to decay fast enough in order not to generate a late entropy release at nucleosynthesis\ntime. We have seen that an axion in the MeV range is consistent with these two requirements. An axion\nof this type could be searched for at colliders, and in this respect the analysis of its possible detection\nat the LHC would follow quite closely the patterns described by two of us in [41]. As in this previous\n(non-supersymmetric) study, where the axion is Higgs-like (of a mass in the GeV region) typical channels\nwhere to look for this particle would be a) the associated production of an axion and a direct photon;\nb) the multi-axion production channel, and c) the associated production of one axion and other Higgses\nof the CP-even sector. The modifications, compared to that previous study, would now involve 1) the\nlower value of the mass of the axion (MeV rather than GeV); 2) the presence of extra supersymmetric\ninteractions.\n\n10.1\n\nComments\n\nOne important comment concerns the connection between these class of models and their completion\ntheories such as string theory, which lay at their foundation. In our study we have selected a scenario\ncharacterized by low energy supersymmetry, with a phenomenological analysis that is essentially connected\nwith the TeV scale and above. This is the scale which is likely to be scanned in the near future by several\nexperiments, including the LHC, and for this reason we have directed out numerical studies in this\ndirection. There is, however, a second it involves a value of MSt which is very large and close to the\nPlanck scale. In this second case the model predicts, obviously, a decoupling of the anomalous symmetry,\nleaving at low energy a scenario which is essentially the same of the MSSM, since the extra Z prime,\nwhich is part of the spectrum, is extremely heavy. This would obviously imply a decoupling both of\nthe anomalous gauge boson and of the anomalous trilinear interactions which are associated with it. A\nphysical axion could, however, survive this limit, if the scale of the extra potential is also of the order of\nMSt , but its interaction with ordinary matter would be extremely suppressed by the same scale.\n\n11\n\nConclusions\n\nThe investigation of the phenomenological role played by models containing anomalous gauge interactions\nfrom abelian extensions of the Standard Model, we believe that will receive further attention in the\nfuture. These studies can be motivated within several scenarios, including string and supergravity theories,\nin which gauged axionic symmetries are introduced for anomaly cancellation. In turn, these modified\n31\n\n\fmechanisms of cancellation of the anomalies, which involve an anomalous fermion spectrum and an axion,\nare essentially connected with the UV completion of these field theories, which in a string framework is\nrealized by the Green-Schwarz mechanism.\nThe model that we have investigated (the USSM-A) summarizes the most salient physical features of\nthese types of constructions, where a St\u00fcckelberg supermultiplet is associated to an anomalous abelian\nstructure in order to restore the gauge invariance of the anomalous effective action. In this work we\nhave tried to characterize in detail some among the main phenomenological implications of these models,\nwhich are particularly interesting for cosmology. The physical axion of this construction, or gauged axion,\nemerges as a component of the St\u00fcckelberg field Im b. We have pointed out that the mechanism of sequential misalignment, formerly discussed in the non-supersymmetric case [30], finds a natural application also\nin the presence of supersymmetry, with minor modifications.\nOne relevant feature of these models, already noticed in [30], is that their axions do not contribute\nto the isocurvature perturbations of the early universe, being gauge degrees of freedom at the scale of\ninflation.\nWe have followed a specific pattern in order to come out with specific results in these types of models,\nusing for this purpose a particular superpotential (the USSM superpotential), whose essential features,\nhowever, may well be generic.\nWe have presented an accurate study of the neutralino relic densities, showing that the St\u00fcckelberg\nmass value is constrained by the requirement of a consistent mass spectrum, with values for the lightest\nCP-even Higgs larger than the current LHC limits ( > 120 GeV)\nand by the experimental value for the dark matter abundance from WMAP [52]. Thus, in these\nmodels, the allowed value of the St\u00fcckelberg scale is positively correlated with the value of tan \u03b2. As\nit grows, tan \u03b2 has also to grow (for a fixed value of the vev of the singlet vS ) in order to preserve the\nWMAP bound. In particular MSt and vS are positively correlated. This correlation is necessary in order\nto obtain values of the neutralino mass which allow to satisfy the same bounds, which in our case is\naround 20 GeV.\nWe have seen that with a St\u00fcckelberg mass in the TeV range the non-thermal population of axions does\nnot contribute significantly to the dark matter densities if these axions are PQ-like. These types of constraints, obviously, are typical of supersymmetric constructions and are avoided in a non-supersymmetric\ncontext. In this second case, as discussed in [30], a St\u00fcckelberg scale around 107 GeV is sufficient to revert\nthis trend.\nWe have also pointed out that gauged axions in the milli-eV mass range are probably difficult to\nreconcile with current bounds from direct searches, while the case for detecting MeV or heavier axions, in\nthese types of models, remains a wide open possibility. In this second case, cascade decays of these light\nparticles and their associated production with photons should be seen as their possible event signatures\nat the LHC.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Nikos Irges, George Lazarides and Antonio Racioppi for discussions.

The gauge structure of the\nmodel is of the form SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)Y \u00d7 U (1)B , where B is the anomalous gauge boson, and with a\nmatter content given by the usual generations of the Standard Model (SM). In all the Lagrangians below\nwe implicitly sum over the three fermion generations. A list of the fundamental superfields and charge\nassignments is summarized in Tab. 2. The Lagrangian can be expressed as\nLU SSM \u2212A = LU SSM + LKM + LF I + Laxion\n\n(73)\n\nwhere the Lagrangian of the USSM (LU SSM ) has been modified by the addition of Laxion to compensate\nfor the anomalous variation of the corresponding effective action due to the anomalous charge assignments.\nThe former is given by\nLU SSM = Llep + Lquark + LHiggs + Lgauge + LSM T + LGM T\n\n(74)\n\nwith contributions from the leptons, quarks and Higgs plus gauge kinetic terms.

We\nrecall that St\u00fcckelberg fields appear both in anomalous and in non-anomalous contexts.

Relic densities at the second misalignment\n\nIn this appendix we fill in the gaps in the derivation of the expression of the abundances generated by\nthe mechanism of vacuum misalignment. We start from the Lagrangian\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1 2 1 2\n4 \u221a\nS= d x g\n\u03c7\u0307 \u2212 m\u03c7 \u0393\u03c7 \u03c7\u0307 ,\n(95)\n2\n2\nwhere \u0393\u03c7 is the decay rate of the axion and we have expanded the potential around its minimum up to\nquadratic terms. The same action is derived from the quadratic approximation to the general expression\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1 2\n2\n4\n4\n3\n(96)\n\u03c3 (\u2202\u03b1 \u03b8) \u2212 \u03bc (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) \u2212 V0\nS = d xR (t)\n2 \u03c7\nwhich, in our case, is constructed from the expression of V \u2032 given in Eq. (33), with \u03bc \u223c v, the electroweak\nscale. We also set other contributions to the vacuum potential to vanish (V0 = 0). In a FriedmannRobertson-Walker spacetime metric with a scaling factor R(t), this action gives the equation of motion\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\nd\n3\n(97)\nR (t)(\u03c7\u0307 + \u0393\u03c7 + R3 m2\u03c7 (T ) = 0.\ndt\n\nWe will neglect the decay rate of the axion in this case and set \u0393\u03c7 \u2248 0. At this point, since the potential\nV \u2032 is of non-perturbative origin, we can assume that it vanishes far above the electroweak scale (or\ntemperature Tew ). For this reason m\u03c7 = mb = 0 for T \u226b Tew , which is essentially equivalent to assume\nthat the St\u00fcckelberg axion is not subject to any mixing far above the weak scale. The general equation\nof motion derived from Eq. (97), introducing a temperature dependent mass, can be written as\n\u03c7\u0308 + 3H \u03c7\u0307 + m2\u03c7 (T )\u03c7 = 0,\n\n(98)\n\nwhich clearly allows as a solution a constant value of the misalignment angle \u03b8 = \u03b8i . The T-dependence of\nthe mass term should be generated, for consistency, from a generalization to finite temperature of V \u2032 . In\npractice this is not necessary in our case, being the role of the first misalignment negligible in determining\nthe final mass of the axion.\nThe axion energy density is given by\n\u03c1=\n\n1 2 1 2 2\n\u03c7\u0307 + m\u03c7 \u03c7 ,\n2\n2\n\n(99)\n\nwhich after a harmonic averaging gives\nh\u03c1i = m2\u03c7 h\u03c72 i.\n\n(100)\n\nNotice that after differentiating Eq. (99) and using the equation of motion in (98), followed by the\naveraging Eq. (100) one obtains the relation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u1e41\nh\u03c1\u0307i = h\u03c1i \u22123H +\n,\n(101)\nm\n38\n\n\fwhere the time dependence of the mass is through its temperature T (t), while H(t) = \u1e58(t)/R(t) is the\nHubble parameter. By inspection one easily finds that the solution of this equation is of the form\nm\u03c7 (T )\nR3 (t)\n\nh\u03c1i =\n\n(102)\n\nshowing a dilution of the energy density with an increasing space volume, valid even for a T -dependent\nmass. At this point, the universe must be (at least) as old as the required period of oscillation in order\nfor the axion field to start oscillating and to appear as dark matter, otherwise \u03b8 is misaligned but frozen;\nthis is the content of the condition\nm\u03c7 (Ti ) = 3H(Ti ),\n\n(103)\n\nwhich allows to identify the initial temperature of the coherent oscillation of the axion field \u03c7, Ti , by\nequating m\u03c7 (T ) to the Hubble rate, taken as a function of temperature.\nTo quantify the relic densities at the current temperature T0 (T0 \u2261 T (t0 ), at current time t0 ) we define\npreliminarily the two standard effective couplings\nX \u0012 Ti \u00133 7 X \u0012 Ti \u00133\ng\u2217,S,T =\ngi\ngi\n+\nT\n8\nT\nB\nF\nX \u0012 Ti \u00134 7 X \u0012 Ti \u00134\ngi\n+\n,\n(104)\ng\u2217,T =\ngi\nT\n8\nT\nF\n\nB\n\nfunctions of the massless relativistic degrees of freedom of the primordial state, with T \u226b Tew . The\ncounting of the degrees of freedom is: 2 for a Majorana fermion and for a massless gauge boson, 3 for\na massive gauge boson and 1 for a real scalar. In the radiation era, the thermodynamics of all the\ncomponents of the primordial state is entirely determined by the temperature T , being the system at\nequilibrium. We exclude for simplicity all sorts of possible source of entropy due to any inhomogeneity\n(see, for instance, [55]). Pressure and entropy are then just given as a function of the temperature\n\u03c1 = 3p =\ns=\n\n\u03c02\ng\u2217,T T 4\n30\n\n2\u03c0 2\ng\u2217,S,T T 3 ,\n45\n\nwhile the Friedmann equation allows to relate the Hubble parameter and the energy density\nr\n8\nH=\n\u03c0GN \u03c1,\n3\n\n(105)\n\n(106)\n\nwith GN = 1/MP2 being the Newton constant and MP the Planck mass. The number density of axions\nn\u03c7 decreases as 1/R3 with the expansion, as does the entropy density s \u2261 S/R3 , where S indicates\nthe comoving entropy density - which remains constant in time (\u1e60 = 0) - leaving the ratio Ya \u2261 n\u03c7 /s\nconserved. We define, as usual, the abundance variable of \u03c7\nY\u03c7 (Ti ) =\n39\n\nn\u03c7\ns\n\n(107)\nTi\n\n\fat the temperature of oscillation Ti , and observe that at the beginning of the oscillations the total energy\ndensity is just the potential one\n\u03c1\u03c7 = n\u03c7 (Ti )m\u03c7 (Ti ) = 1/2m2\u03c7 (Ti )\u03c72i .\n\n(108)\n\nWe then obtain for the initial abundance at T = Ti\nY\u03c7 (Ti ) =\n\n45m\u03c7 (Ti )\u03c72i\n1 m\u03c7 (Ti )\u03c72i\n=\n2\ns\n4\u03c0 2 g\u2217,S,T Ti3\n\n(109)\n\nwhere we have inserted at the last stage the expression of the entropy of the system at the temperature\nTi given by Eq. (105). At this point, plugging the expression of \u03c1 given in Eq. (105) into the expression of\nthe Hubble rate as a function of density given n Eq. (106), the condition for oscillation Eq. (103) allows\nto express the axion mass at T = Ti in terms of the effective massless degrees of freedom evaluated at the\nsame temperature, that is\nr\nT2\n4 3\nm\u03c7 (Ti ) =\n\u03c0 g\u2217,Ti i .\n(110)\n5\nMP\nThis gives for Eq. (109) the expression\n45\u03c3\u03c72 \u03b8i2\nY\u03c7 (Ti ) = p\n,\n2 5\u03c0g\u2217,Ti Ti MP\n\n(111)\n\nwhere we have expressed \u03c7 in terms of the angle of misalignment \u03b8i at the temperature when oscillations\nstart. We assume that \u03b8i = h\u03b8i is the zero mode of the initial misalignment angle after an averaging. As\nwe have already mentioned, Ti should be determined consistently by Eq. (103). However, the presence of\ntwo significant and unknown variables in the expression of m\u03c7 , which are the coupling of the anomalous\nU (1), gB , and the St\u00fcckelberg mass M , forces us to consider the analysis of the T-dependence of \u03c7\nphenomenologically less relevant. It is more so if the St\u00fcckelberg mass is somehow close to the TeV\nregion, in which case the zero temperature axion mass m\u03c7 acquires corrections proportional to the bare\ncoupling (m\u03c7 \u223c \u03bbv(1 + O(gB )).\nFor this reason, assuming that the oscillation temperature Ti is close to the electroweak temperature\nTew , Eq. (110) provides an upper bound for the mass of the axion at which the oscillations occur, assuming\nthat they start around the electroweak phase transition. Stated differently, mass values of \u03c7 such that\nm(Ti ) \u226a 3H(Ti ) correspond to frozen degrees of freedom of the axion at the electroweak scale. This is\nclearly an approximation, but it allows to define the oscillation mass in terms of the Hubble parameter\nfor each given temperature.\nWe recall that the relic density due to misalignment can be extracted from the relations\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1mis\nn \u03c7 0 m\u03c7 s 0\n(n\u03c70 m\u03c7 )\n\u03c70\nmis\n=\n=\n(112)\n\u03a9\u03c7 \u2261\n\u03c1c\n\u03c1c\ns0\n\u03c1c\nwhere we have denoted with n\u03c70 the current number density of axions and with \u03c1mis\n\u03c70 their current energy\ndensity due to vacuum misalignment. This expression can be rewritten as\n\u03a9mis\n=\n\u03c7\n\nn\u03c7\ns\n40\n\nm\u03c7\nTi\n\ns0\n\u03c1c\n\n(113)\n\n\fusing the conservation of the abundance Ya0 = Ya (Ti ). Notice that in Eq. (113) we have neglected a\npossible dilution factor \u03b3 = sosc /s0 which may be present due to entropy release. We have introduced the\nvariable\n3H02\n(114)\n\u03c1c =\n8\u03c0GN\nwhich is the critical density and\n2\u03c0 2\ng\u2217S,T0 T03\n(115)\ns0 =\n45\nwhich is the current entropy density. To fix g\u2217S,T0 we just recall that at the current temperature T0 the\nrelativistic species contributing to the entropy density s0 are the photons and three families of neutrinos\nwith\n\u0012 \u00133\n7\nT\u03bd\ng\u2217S,T0 = 2 + \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2\n(116)\n8\nT0\nwhere, from entropy considerations, T\u03bd /T0 = (4/11)1/3 .\nTo proceed with the computation of the massless degrees of freedom above the electroweak phase\ntransition we just recall the structure of the model. We have 13 gauge bosons corresponding to the gauge\ngroup SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 UY (1) \u00d7 UB (1), 2 Higgs doublets, 3 generations of leptons and 3 families of quarks.\nAbove the energy of the electroweak transition we have only massless fields with the exception of the\nUB (1) gauge boson, since this symmetry takes the St\u00fcckelberg form above the electroweak scale, giving\ng\u2217,T = 110.75. Below the same scale this number is similarly computed with g\u2217,T = 91.25. Other useful\nparameters are the critical density and the current entropy\n\u03c1c = 5.2 * 10\u22126 GeV/cm3\n\ns0 = 2970 cm\u22123 ,\n\n(117)\n\nwith \u03b8i \u2243 1. It is clear, by inserting these numbers into Eq. (112) that \u03a9mis\n\u03c7\n45\u03c3\u03c72 \u03b8i2\nm\u03c7 s 0\np\n2 5\u03c0g\u2217,Ti Ti MP \u03c1c\n\n(118)\n\n2 /v is of the same order of f \u223c 1012 GeV, the standard PQ constant. This\nis negligible unless \u03c3\u03c7 \u223c MSt\na\nchoice would correspond to \u03a9\u03c7 \u223c 0.1, but the value of MSt should be of O(107 ) GeV .\n\nReferences\n[1] R. D. Peccei and H. R.
