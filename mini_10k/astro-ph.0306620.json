This made inflationary predictions insensitive to what was going on between horizon\ncrossing and horizon reentry and thus could lead to very robust predictions. However, it was realised [1] that in the\npresence of more degrees of freedom \u03b6 can vary on superhorizon scales due to the presence of a non-adiabatic pressure\nperturbation. This fact was shown in a very simple manner in [1] using only energy momentum conservation. The\nrule for a varying or non-varying \u03b6 was derived using linear perturbation theory. The extent to which the rule is\ntrue when nonlinearities are taken into account remained largely unanswered, although one would expect intuitively\nthat it would still hold. As far as we are aware, there are three references where nonlinear conservation of a variable\nconnected to the linear \u03b6 has been mentioned [2, 3, 4] and, in all cases, their results refer to single field inflationary\nmodels.\nDealing with nonlinearities in general relativity is in general a very difficult issue. Yet there exists an approximation which makes the problem tractable and which is particularly relevant during inflation. The quasi-exponential\nexpansion stretches modes to vast superhorizon scales. Hence, a long wavelength approximation for the study of\ninhomogeneous spacetimes smoothed on scales larger than the horizon becomes particularly relevant. The resulting\npicture of the inhomogeneous universe is quite simple. Each point evolves like a separate homogeneous universe with\nslightly different values for the Hubble rate, scalefactor, scalar field etc. One can find nonlinear variables describing\nthe inhomogeneity which do not depend on the choice of time hypersurfaces and which are exactly gauge-invariant in\nthe perturbation theory sense. They are combinations of spatial gradients and are immediately connected with the\nlinear gauge invariant variables R and \u03b6 (see, for example, [5] and references therein). In this letter we would like to\nderive such variables describing the long wavelength curvature perturbation and find their evolution equations. The\nlatter are essentially the same as those of linear perturbation theory. In the process we also elaborate on the separate\nuniverse picture which, so far, has only been used heuristically.\nII.\n\nTHE LONG WAVELENGTH APPROXIMATION AND THE SEPARATE UNIVERSE PICTURE\n\nWe start by assuming that we can smooth out all relevant quantities on scales much larger than the instantaneous\ncomoving hubble radius \u223c (aH)\u22121 . That is, for any quantity Q we will consider the quantity\nZ\n\u22123\nQ\u0304(x) \u2261 R\nd3 x\u2032 Q(x\u2032 )W (|x \u2212 x\u2032 |/R).\n(1)\nW is a window function rapidly decreasing for |x \u2212 x\u2032 | > R and R is a smoothing scale larger than (aH)\u22121 . We\nassume that the Einstein equations act on the Q\u0304's. Of course this is not exact. Smoothing the full equations, i.e\nconvolving the equations with the window function, is not obviously equivalent to the original equations acting on\nsmoothed fields in the case of nonlinear operators. For example, if Q satisfies\nD(Q) = 0\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nthen, in general,\nZ\n\nd3 x\u2032 D(Q(x\u2032 ))W (|x \u2212 x\u2032 |/R) 6= D(Q\u0304)\n\n(3)\n\nif D is a nonlinear operator. Here we assume that D(Q\u0304) = 0 is an adequate description of the physics at long\nwavelengths. Then it is a reasonable approximation to say that we can drop those terms in the equations which\ncontain more than one spatial gradient [2]. They are expected to be small compared with time derivatives. This will\nbe the main approximation and will lead to a picture where different points of the universe evolve independently 1 .\nAn interesting picture emerges when one also considers the quantum fluctuations of the various physical fields during\nan inflationary era. In such an era the comoving horizon decreases rapidly and the various modes that are exposed as\nthey exit the horizon can be treated as classical stochastic fields [23]. Assuming that the equations hold when acting\non the Q\u0304's and writing the relevant Einstein equations as first order in time one sees that a time dependent window\nfunction results in extra terms in the equations. Indeed the time derivative of Q\u0304 now has two terms,\nZ\n\u2202\n\u2202 Q\u0304\n\u2202Q\n=\n+ d3 x\u2032 Q(x\u2032 ) W (|x \u2212 x\u2032 |/R)\n(4)\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nThe integration in (4) is restricted over modes close to horizon exit so Q(x\u2032 ) can be taken to be the quantum short\nwavlength field which has turned classical. Hence all evolution equations get augmented by a stochastic term. This\nis what has been used in the past to derive an effective langevin equation for the evolution of the inflaton field. In\nthis letter we are concerned with the evolution of the spacetime after the inhomogeneity has been set up by quntum\nfluctuations. We develop a stochastic framework that takes into account gravitational perturbations and is gauge\ninvariant in the long wavelength limit in [24].\nNow, consider the ADM parametrisation of the metric [6, 8]. One imagines spacetime to be foliated by spacelike\nhypersurfaces with a normal vector\nn0 = \u2212N, ni = 0, n0 = N \u22121 , ni = N \u22121 N i .\n\n(5)\n\nHere, N is called the lapse function and N i the shift vector. The latter measures the deviation of the timelike lines\nwhich define the spatial coordinates from the integral curves of the normal to the time hypersurfaces. The metric\ntakes the form\ng00 = \u2212N 2 + \u03b3 ij Ni Nj , g0i = \u2212Ni , gij = \u03b3ij ,\n\n(6)\n\ng 00 = \u2212N \u22122 , g 0i = \u2212N \u22122 N i , g ij = \u03b3 ij \u2212 N \u22122 N i N j ,\n\n(7)\n\nwith the inverse\n\nwhere \u03b3ij is the metric on the spatial hypersurfaces. The four functions N and N i parametrize the gauge freedom\nof general relativity and are arbitrary. The choice of gauge in the conventional language of perturbation theory is\nessentially the choice of N and N i for linearized perturbations. The way the spatial hypersurfaces are embedded in\nthe 4D geometry is parametrised by the extrinsic curvature tensor\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2202\nKij = \u2212\nNi|j + Nj|i + \u03b3ij .\n(8)\n2N\n\u2202t\nHere a vertical bar denotes a covariant derivative w.r.t \u03b3ij . From now on we will use coordinate systems with shift\nvector N i = 0. For matter described by the energy momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd we have the energy density\nE \u2261 n\u03bc n\u03bd T\u03bc\u03bd = N \u22122 T00 ,\n\n(9)\n\nJi \u2261 \u2212n\u03bc T\u03bc i = \u2212N \u22121 T0i ,\n\n(10)\n\nthe momentum density\n\n1\n\nParticular solutions for long wavelength equations as well as an iteration scheme based on a gradient expansion has been considered by\nvarious authors in the past, see eg. [9]. A separate universe picture has also been discussed in [10] in the context of perturbing solutions\nof the homogeneous equations w.r.t the constants that appear in them. Here, we are interested not in particular solutions but general\nproperties of the nonlinear evolution of the long wavelength inhomogeneity codified by variables like (52).\n\n\f3\nand the stress tensor\nSij \u2261 Tij .\n\n(11)\n\nA bar above a tensor will denote its traceless part\n1\nK\u0304ij = Kij \u2212 K\u03b3ij ,\nK = K ii = \u03b3 ij Kij .\n(12)\n3\nWe can now write the Einstein equations for the above variables, dropping all terms which explicitely contain second\norder spatial derivatives and setting N i =0.

Now since T r(\u03b3\u0303 \u0307 ij ) = 0, we have\nK\u0304ij = \u2212\n\n1 1/3  \u0307\n\u03b3 \u03b3\u0303 ij\n2N\n\n(31)\n\n1 \u03b3\u0307\n.\n2N \u03b3\n\n(32)\n\nand\nK =\u2212\n\nThe determinant \u03b3(x, t) contains what in linear theory is usually called a scalar perturbation mode of the metric.\n\u03b3\u0303ij (x, t) contains another scalar, the vector and tensor perturbations. From (32) we see that K(x, t) can be interpreted\nas a locally-defined Hubble parameter since \u03b3 1/3 (x, t) \u2261 a(x, t) is a locally defined scalefactor. It can be explicitly\nshown that the system (24-29), a truncated form of Einstein's equations, forms a consistent set of equations, by which\nwe mean that the evolution preserves the constraints. So an initial inhomogeneous configuration which respects the\nconstraint (29), can be evolved with the evolution equations and the constraint always will be satisfied. Now observe\nthat the only equation where spatial derivatives appear is the constraint (29) (and eqn (27) but this turns out to be\nirrelevant). Hence, after initial data which respect it have been specified, each point can be evolved individually. The\nrelevant equations are essentially those of the homogeneous FRW cosmology, valid locally, modulo the K\u0304 i j terms.\nThis is exactly what has been termed in the past as the 'separate universe approach' (see, for example, [1]). It was\nexplicitly stated in [2] in the context of general relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi theory. We see that such an approach is\nequivalent to the first order of a spatial gradient expansion.\nAlthough we can solve the equations numerically retaining the K\u0304 i j terms, we can readily see that they are not\nexpected to be important dynamically [2]. Using (32) we can solve (25) to get\nK\u0304 i j = C i j (x)\u03b3 \u22121/2 .\n\n(33)\n\nSo, in the absence of sources, in an expanding universe (particularly for quasi-exponential expansion), the traceless\npart of the extrinsic curvature K\u0304 i j decays rapidly. In most cases, therefore, it will be safe to ignore the K\u0304 terms.\nOf course, in the presence of quantum fluctuations K\u0304 is sourced mostly by the fluctuating \u03b3 (see (31)). Ignoring K\u0304,\nequations (24-29) become\n\u0001\ndK\n12\u03c0\n=\nN GAB \u03a0A \u03a0B\n2\ndt\nmpl\n\n(34)\n\nd A\nB C\nAB \u2202V\n\u03a0 = N K\u03a0A \u2212 N \u0393A\nBC \u03a0 \u03a0 \u2212 N G\ndt\n\u2202\u03c6B\n\u0012\n\u0013\n24\u03c0 1\nK2 =\nGAB \u03a0A \u03a0B + V\nm2pl 2\n12\u03c0\n\u2202i K =\nGAB \u03a0A \u2202i \u03c6B ,\nm2pl\n\n(36)\n\n\u03c6\u0307A\n= \u03a0A ,\nN\n\n(38)\n\n(35)\n\n(37)\n\nwhere\n\nand \u0393A\nBC is the Connection formed from GAB . Eqns (34-37) are exactly the same as those of a homogeneous cosmology\napart from the momentum constraint (37). Hence, the long wavelength universe looks like a collection of homogeneous\n\n\f5\nuniverses, each evolving according to the equations of FRW cosmology. The only information about inhomogeneity\nis contained in the momentum constraint (37) [2].\nIn single field homogeneous cosmology, it is very convenient to parametrize the Hubble rate H in terms of the\nvalue of the scalar field leading to what is called the Hamilton Jacobi formulation. A similar thing can be done here.\nObserve that (37) is satisfied if K = K(\u03c6A ) and\n\u03a0A =\n\nm2pl\n12\u03c0\n\nGAB\n\n\u2202K\n.\n\u2202\u03c6B\n\n(39)\n\nSubstituting this into the Friedmann equation (36) gives the Hamilton Jacobi equation for a system of scalar fields\n[2]\nK2 \u2212\n\nm2pl AB \u2202K \u2202K\n24\u03c0\n= 2 V.\nG\n12\u03c0\n\u2202\u03c6A \u2202\u03c6B\nmpl\n\n(40)\n\nSo, K is a function of the scalar fields only. Note that this is consistent with equation (34) which can now be written\nK\u0307 =\n\n\u2202K  \u0307C\n\u03c6 .\n\u2202\u03c6C\n\n(41)\n\nHence, given appropriate boundary conditions, a solution to equation (40) determines the state of the system completely in terms of its position in the configuration space of the scalar fields. This result now holds for an inhomogeneous\nuniverse smoothed on superhorizon scales.\nSolving (40) analytically is not straightforward for a general potential. Explicit solutions for the case of an exponential potential have been given in [2]. During inflation, it is usually a very good approximation to consider a\nslow-roll behaviour where the derivative terms can be neglected. Then (40) becomes the usual slow-roll relation\nK2 =\n\n24\u03c0\nV.\nm2pl\n\n(42)\n\nIn this case the momentum constraint is equivalent to (36). Another case where an approximate solution can be found\nis the study of deviations of the scalar field about some stable point which are small compared to mpl [7]. In any\ncase, a solution to equation (40) describes the long wavelength system completely. An interesting point noted in [2],\nis the attractor property of solutions of (40). The latter contain a number of arbitrary parameters C A , reflecting the\nfreedom to choose initial conditions of the field momenta (to specify the motion one must assign not only an initial\nvalue for \u03c6 but also \u03c6\u0307 at each point). Neglecting the K\u0304 terms means that these parameters are spatially independent.\nOf course, when assigning initial conditions the momenta need not be strictly determined by the field values. So, in\nprinciple these constant parameters should be spatially dependent too. So suppose one considers a function K(\u03c6A , C),\nthen\nm2pl AB \u2202K \u2202 \u2202K\n\u2202K\n2K\n=\nG\n\u2202C\n6\u03c0\n\u2202\u03c6A \u2202\u03c6B \u2202C\nm2pl AB \u2202K \u2202\n\u2202K\n\u21d2K =\nln\nG\n12\u03c0\n\u2202\u03c6A \u2202\u03c6B\n\u2202C\n\u2202K\n1 \u2202\nln\n(43)\n=\nN \u2202t\n\u2202C\nwhere we have used (38) and (39). From (43) and (32) we see that\n\u2202K\n\u221d a\u22123 .\n\u2202C\n\n(44)\n\nThus the freedom to choose the momentum independently at each point, reflected in the freedom to choose constants\nin the solution of (40), becomes irrelevant very quickly2 .\nFrom now on we will also be using the more familiar notation\nK(t, x) = \u22123H(t, x) ,\n\u03b3(t, x) = a6 (t, x),\nwhere a and H are the locally defined values of the scale factor and the Hubble rate.\n\n2\n\nThis is intimately connected to the fact that perturbation modes freeze when they exit the horizon\n\n(45)\n\n\f6\nIII.\n\nTHE LONG WAVELENGTH CURVATURE PETURBATION\n\nIn linear perturbation theory, a common variable used to characterize the perturbations is \u03b4\u03b6 defined as\n\u0011\n\u03b4H\nH\u0010\n\u03b4E\n\u03c8\u0307 + H\u03c8 = \u03c8 \u2212 H\n=\u03c8\u2212\n\u03b4\u03b6 = \u03c8 \u2212 H\n \u0307\nE\n\u1e22\n\u1e22\n\n(46)\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the scalar perturbation of the spatial part of the metric, \u03c8 = \u03b4a(t, x)/a(t). The quantity \u03b4\u03b6 is gauge\ninvariant and corresponds to the curvature perturbation in a time slicing that sets \u03b4E = 0. In the case of single\nfield inflation, where there is one degree of freedom, on long wavelengths, \u03b4 \u03b6\u0307 = 0. When there are many scalar fields\npresent [1]\n\u03b4 \u03b6\u0307 = \u2212\n\nH\n\u03b4pnad ,\n(E + p)\n\n(47)\n\nwhere \u03b4pnad is the non-adiabatic pressure perturbation. In general, when there is a well defined equation of state\np = p(E), \u03b4pnad =0. We will now derive a nonlinear generalisation of \u03b4\u03b6 and eqn (47) for the nonlinear long wavelength\ncase.\nConsider a generic time slicing and some initial time tI . We can integrate the local metric determinant up to a\nsurface of constant energy density using (32)\nln a(tI , x) = ln a(t, x) \u2212\n\nZT\n\nN (t\u2032 , x)H(t\u2032 , x)dt\u2032 ,\n\n(48)\n\ntI\n\nwhere T (E(x)) is the value of t at the point x for E(x) = const. Taking the spatial derivative and using (32) once\nmore we see that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZT\n\u2202T\n\u2202i [ln a(tI , x)] = \u2202i \u2212 i \u2202t ln a(t, x) \u2212 \u2202i [N (t\u2032 , x)H(t\u2032 , x)] dt\u2032\n\u2202x\ntI\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZT\n\u2202T\n= \u2202i \u2212 i \u2202t ln \u03b3(t, x) \u2212 \u2202i \u2202t [ln a(t\u2032 , x)] dt\u2032\n\u2202x\n\n(49)\n\ntI\n\nwhich can be written\n\u2202i [ln a(T, x)] = \u2202i [ln a(t, x)] \u2212\n\n\u2202T\nN (t, x)H(t, x),\n\u2202xi\n\n(50)\n\nor\n(E)\n\nXi\n\n= Xi \u2212\n\nNH\n\u2202i E,\ndE/dT\n\n(51)\n\nwhere we have defined Xi \u2261 \u2202i ln a and T = T (E). Note that the gradient of the l.h.s of (50) is evaluated along the\nhypersurface E = const. We see that with any choice of N , the particular combination of gradients appearing on the\nr.h.s of (51) always equals the gradient of ln a on a surface where E = const. So we are led to examine the variable\n\u03b6i = Xi \u2212\n\nNH\n\u2202i E,\n\u0116\n\n(52)\n\nas a coordinate independent measure of the nonlinear curvature perturbation. Let us first see how this variable evolves\nwith time. Taking the time derivative of (52) and using (26) we arrive at\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1\n\u0116\u2202\nS\n\u2212\n\u1e60\u2202\nE\n,\n(53)\n\u03b6\u0307i =\n\u0001\ni\ni\n3 E + 1S 2\n3\nor, by using (26) once more\n\n1 NH\n\u0001\n\u03b6\u0307i = \u2212\n3 E + 13 S\n\n\u1e60\n\u2202i S \u2212 \u2202i E\n\u0116\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(54)\n\n\f7\nThis should be compared with (47). It is easy to see that if there is a well defined equation of state S = S(E), then\nthe r.h.s of (53) is zero. Therefore, the long wavelength curvature perturbation, described by the vector \u03b6i , can evolve\non superhorizon scales if and only if there exists a non-adiabatic pressure perturbation. This was proved in [1] for the\ncase of linear perturbation theory by making use only of energy conservation. The same applied here. Hence equation\n(28) shows that this result extends to the nonlinear case if we use the vector \u03b6i to describe the perturbation.\nThe connection with the usual linearized gauge invariant variable \u03b6 is obvious from (52). Writing X = ln(\u03b3),\nE = E(t) + \u03b4E, \u03b3 = \u03b3(t) + \u03b4\u03b3 and dropping terms quadratic in the perturbations, we see that\n\u03b6i \u2243 \u2202i \u03b4\u03b6 ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nNH\n\u03b4a\n\u2212\n\u03b4\u03b6 \u2243\n(t, x0 ) \u03b4E + C(t),\na\nE \u0307\n\n(55)\n\nwith C(t) the background number of e-folds.\nThe quantity \u03b6i was defined with respect to the energy density. Also the way we arrived at it was at best heuristic.\nWe will now show that for any inhomogeneous spacetime scalar \u03c6(t, x), the variable\nRi = Xi \u2212\n\nNH\n\u2202i \u03c6\n\u03c6\u0307\n\n(56)\n\nis gauge invariant in the long wavelength approximation under mild conditions regarding the allowed coordinate\ntransformations. Consider the transformation\n(t, x) \u2192 (T (t, x), X(t, x)) .\n\n(57)\n\nT ,j\ndT,\nT ,0 T,0\n\n(58)\n\nThen, it can be shown that [2]\nX j = f j (xi ) +\n\nZ\n\nwhere f j is an arbitrary function independent of time. One can choose it for convenience to be \u03b4ji xj [2] but one\ncan also attach a physical meaning to such a choice as can be seen in figure 1. Related considerations in matching\nperturbed and homogeneous spacetimes are discussed in [11]. We note that the transformation (58) holds between\ngauges with the shift Ni = 0. Assuming that the new time coordinate T is non-singular, that is, that the new time\nhypersurfaces do not get too 'wrinkly', we can discard the gradient of the integral as second order in spatial gradients.\nWe then have\n\u2202X j\n\u2243 \u03b4j i .\n\u2202xi\n\n(59)\n\nConsider now a gauge with coordinates x\u03bc where \u2202i \u03c6 = 0 and a transformation to a different gauge with coordinates\nX \u03bc\u0303 .

A particular patch of spacetime during inflation starts its life inside the horizon\nwhere it can be considered as homogeneous. Classical perturbations are generated when modes cross the horizon and freeze in.\nWhile subhorizon and homogeneous, there is a preferred time slicing in the patch to which all slicings and spatial coordinate\nchoices should match. This fixes f j (xi ) = \u03b4ij xi . This choice separates changes in the time slicing \u2013 which we want to consider\nas a gauge choice \u2013 from possible coordinate transformations of the homogeneous spacetime.\n\nTherefore\n\u2202i ln \u03b3 =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202T ln \u03b3\u0303 \u2202\nln \u03b3\u0303 \u2212\n\u03c6.\ni\n\u2202X\n\u2202T \u03c6 \u2202X i\n\n(64)\n\nNow, since the transformation we used was arbitrary (up to considerations for the smooth behaviour of the new time\nT ), and noting that\nH =\u2212\n\n1\n\u2202T ln \u03b3\u0303\n6NT\n\n(65)\n\nNH\n\u2202i \u03c6,\n\u03c6\u0307\n\n(66)\n\nand Xi = \u2202i ln a, we conclude that the variable\nRi = Xi \u2212\n\nequals the gradient of the spatial metric determinant in a gauge where the scalar \u03c6 is homogeneous; it is, therefore,\na nonlinear gauge invariant measure of the perturbations. When the scalar is taken to be the energy density E we\nrecover \u03b6i of eqn (52).\nWe would like to remark here that the use of spatial gradients to describe perturbations in a gauge invariant\nmanner was first advocated in [12]. There, the use of the word 'gauge' refers to a choice of a correspondence between\na fictitious background homogeneous spacetime and the real perturbed universe. So a gauge invariant quantity is one\nthat does not change when this correspondence is altered, which is achieved when the quantity either vanishes or is\na trivial tensor in the background [13, 14]. In this sense, any gradient is gauge invariant since it must vanish on the\nhomogeneous background. Here, however, by a choice of gauge we mean a choice of the lapse function N and the\nshift vector Ni [5], so we look for quantities such as (66) that are invariant under a change of time slicing as well.\nExamples\nWhen the scalar \u03c6 in (56) is taken to be the inflaton it can be easily verifield that Ri is also conserved. Using eqns\n(34\u201337) one can show that\n\u1e58i = 0 .\n\n(67)\n\nWhen there is more than one scalar field present, however, the situation is different. It is well known in linear\nperturbation theory [1, 15, 16] that perturbations in multi-scalar field models can source the curvature perturbation\n\u03b4\u03b6 on long wavelengths, making the time evolution of the latter possible. Let us see how this effect is very easily seen\nin the formalism developed in the previous section without the need to resort to linear perturbation theory. Consider\nhypersurfaces with \u2202i E = 0. From (28) with the K\u0304 terms omitted we see that\nE,i = 0 \u21d2 H,i = 0 \u21d2 Ji = 0 \u21d2 GAB \u03a0A \u2202i \u03c6B = 0.\n\n(68)\n\nThe fact that E,i = 0 also means that\nS,i = 2GAB \u03a0A \u2202i \u03a0B .\n\n(69)\n\n\f9\nSo, if there is a single field,\nE,i = 0 \u21d2 H,i = 0 \u21d2 \u2202i \u03c6 = 0 \u21d2 S,i = 0 ,\n\n(70)\n\nsince \u2202i \u03a0 = 0. Hence \u03b6i remains constant. On the other hand, for many fields, we have\nE,i = 0 \u21d2 H,i = 0 \u21d2 GAB \u03a0A \u2202i \u03c6B = 0.\n\n(71)\n\nSo, generally in this case, we may have \u2202i \u03c6A 6= 0. Therefore, from (69) \u2202i S 6= 0 in general and \u03b6i can evolve on\nsuperhorizon scales, \u03b6\u0307i 6= 0.\nIn general, for a system of scalar fields governed by the Lagrangian\nL=\n\n1\nGAB \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6A \u2202\u03bc \u03c6B \u2212 V,\n2\n\nthe variation of \u03b6i from (54) is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n1\n1\nd\nA\nA\n\u2202i \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u0307 \u2202i\n.\n\u03b6\u0307i = VA\ndt GBC \u03a0B \u03a0C\nGBC \u03a0B \u03a0C\n\n(72)\n\n(73)\n\nIn the multi field case it is convenient to consider the variables\nA\nA\nQA\ni = \u03a0 Xi \u2212 H\u2202i \u03c6 ,\n\n(74)\n\nwhich are also invariant under changes of time hypersurfaces in the long wavelength limit.

Initially\nthe first field \u03c3 is stuck slightly displaced from the bottom of a valley while the other field \u03c6 evolves and drives inflation.\nIn this case, we have essentially a single field model and \u03b6i is conserved.

For the period of rolling in the \u03c3-direction we have an extra contribution to \u03b6i\n\u0012\n\u0013\nG\u03c6\u03c3\nH\n(II)\n\u2202i \u03c6 .\n(78)\n= Xi \u2212 \u03c3 \u2202i \u03c3 +\n\u03b6i\n\u03a0\nG\u03c3\u03c3\nNote that for a non-diagonal metric GAB the isocurvature \u03c3-field can contribute to the curvature perturbation even\nfor a straight trajectory [16, 17], in contrast to what happens when GAB = \u03b4AB [15]. Also, if during the rolling along\nthe \u03c3 direction we have a second period of inflation, the \u03c3 field can contribute to the curvature perturbation since\n(I)\n\n\u03b6i = \u03b6i\n\n(II)\n\n+ \u03b6i\n\n.\n\n(79)\n\nIn the case with GAB = \u03b4AB , we can easily find the following evolution equations for the Ri 's in the case of two fields\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\u03c0\n\u03a0\u03c3\n\u1e58\u03c6i = 2 N \u03a0\u03c3 \u2202i \u03c3 \u2212\n\u2202i \u03c6\n(80)\nmpl\n\u03a0\u03c6\nand\n\u1e58\u03c3i =\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a0\u03c6\n4\u03c0\n\u2202\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u2202\n\u03c3\n.\nN\n\u03a0\ni\ni\n\u03c6\nm2pl\n\u03a0\u03c3\n\n(81)\n\n\f10\nFor many general fluids one can write the curvature perturbation as a weighted sum over components [25]\nP  \u0307 A\nEA \u03b6\n\u03b6i = P i .\n\u0116A\n\n(82)\n\nIf the components are non interacting, each will obey an evolution equation like (26), so each \u03b6iA is separately\nconserved. Hence one can see that the time evolution of the total curvature perturbation is determined by the ratio\nof the energy densities of the various components. For example, starting with \u03b6iA = 0 we get\n\u03b6i =\n\n\u0116B\n\u03b6iB\n \u0307\nEA + \u0116B\n\n(83)\n\nThis evolution of the long wavelength curvature perturbation in multifield models is one of the possible mechanisms\nthat could potentially produce significant non gaussianity. Perturbations from the \u03c3 direction can be significantly\nnon-gaussian and now there is the possibility that these fluctuations can contribute to the curvature perturbation\nat later times [18, 19, 20]. This can be seen for example from equations (80) and (82). Other mechanisms relating\nnon-gaussianity with a second scalar field have been proposed [21]. We will return on the issue with more details in\n[24].\nOne can also easily see that there is a particular form of a multi-scalar field potential which will conserve \u03b6i . With\nH,i = 0 we have GAB \u03a0A \u2202i \u03c6B = 0, so to get S,i = 0 we need (see (69) and (39))\nA\n\nB\n\nGAB \u03a0 \u2202i \u03a0 =\n\nm2pl\n12\u03c0\n\nA\n\n\u0012\n\nBC\n\nGAB \u03a0 \u2202i G\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202\u03c6C\n\n\u0013\n\n= 0.\n\n(84)\n\nThus, if\nGAC\n\n\u2202H\n\u03bb A\n\u2202H\n\u03bb\n=\n\u03c6 \u21d2\n=\nGAB \u03c6B ,\nC\nA\n\u2202\u03c6\nmpl\n\u2202\u03c6\nmpl\n\n(85)\n\nwith \u03bb some dimensionless number, then S,i = 0.

So, for a general potential containing both\nquartic and quadratic terms with the various constants related as in (76), the long wavelength curvature perturbation\ndoes not evolve in time. One should keep in mind that the above results only apply when anisotropic stresses are\nnegligible on superhorizon scales and therefore one can safely neglect the K\u0304ji terms.\nWe emphasise again that for the derivation of all of the above no linear approximation has been made. The\nequations are exact and hold at every point of the inhomogeneous spacetime in the long wavelength limit. For more\nuses of this formalism we refer the reader to [24].\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have shown that particular combinations of spatial gradients are good variables to describe the curvature\nperturbation in a long wavelength limit. We also elaborated on the intuitive picture of the 'separate universe approach'\nwhere, given initial data which respect the energy and momentum constraints, one can view the long wavelength\nuniverse as a collection of universes each evolving independently. Such a picture is a simple way to understand\n\n\f11\nnonlinear evolution on large scales and, in particular, to determine the conditions under which the long wavelength\ncurvature perturbation can vary. We believe this is a remarkably straightforward and physically intuitive approach\nwhich should find much wider application.\nNote added: While this paper was undergoing final revision, independent work by Lyth and Wands appeared on the\narchive [25]. This addresses some related issues on \u03b6-conservation using linear perturbation methods.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\nD.Wands, K.A.
