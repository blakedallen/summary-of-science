After briefly reviewing various hadronic neutrino\nsource models, we show how to construct generic upper flux\nbounds. We then turn to the problem of neutrino propagation through the inner Earth and neutrino detection in waterbased \u010cerenkov detectors. Applying the formalism thus developed to the Mannheim-Protheroe-Rachen (MPR) and the\nWaxman & Bahcall flux bounds, we find that event rates of\nseveral hundred to thousand events per year might be possible in next-generation neutrino telescopes. However, a tomography of the inner Earth will face severe constraints due\nto the statistical error of the event rates to be expected.\n\ntrino spectrum is also a power law, Qp\u03b3\n\u03bd (E\u03bd ) \u221d E\u03bd\n(Learned and Mannheim, 2000).\nIn the following, we mention several examples of source\nmodels which have been proposed for ultrahigh energy neutrino production:\n\n1\n\nNeutrinos produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the terrestrial atmosphere can be detected with present-day waterbased \u010cerenkov telescopes and thus serve as an important\nbenchmark (Domogatsky, 2001; Andres et al., 2001).\n\nHadronic neutrino source models\n\nModels for sources producing ultrahigh energy neutrinos can\nbe divided into hadronic and non-hadronic ones, depending\non whether protons play a key part in the neutrino production. In this work we shall limit ourselves to the former class\nof models, referring the reader to Learned and Mannheim\n(2000) for a discussion of non-hadronic source models such\nas the decay of relic particles.\nIndependent of the specific source under consideration,\nthe main idea behind hadronic neutrino production is that a\nbeam of accelerated protons (taken to be of power-law form,\nnp (Ep ) \u221d Ep\u2212s ) hitting a target produces pions, which subsequently decay and thus yield neutrinos. Here, the target\nmay consist of either protons or photons.\nIn case of a target made of protons, if the pions decay prior\nto any interaction with the surrounding medium, the resulting\nneutrino production spectrum is of the same form as the orig\u2212s\ninal spectrum of accelerated protons, i.e. Qpp\n\u03bd (E\u03bd ) \u221d E\u03bd .\nOtherwise, the neutrino spectrum is steepened (Rachen and\nM\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, 1998).\nAn important example of a photon target is given by the\ncosmic background radiation, which leads to the GreisenZatsepin-Kuzm\u0131\u0301n cutoff. In neutrino sources, target photons\nCorrespondence to: C. Hettlage (hettlage@uni-sw.gwdg.de)\n\nmay be produced by means of synchrotron radiation. Assuming that the synchrotron photon spectrum is of the form\nN\u03b3 (E\u03b3 ) \u221d E\u03b3\u2212\u03b1 , one may show that the corresponding neu\u2212(s\u2212\u03b1)\n\nTerrestrial atmosphere:\n\nSun:\nThe same processes responsible for neutrino production in\nthe terrestrial atmosphere can also take place in the Sun.\nHowever, the neutrino flux thus to be expected is so low that\nit will only be discernible with next-generation neutrino detectors (Moskalenko et al., 1991; Hettlage et al., 2000).\nCrab nebula:\nNeutrons resulting from the photodisintegration of iron nuclei may be accelerated in the outer gap of the Crab pulsar\nand may subsequently decay into protons. If these interact\nwith matter in the nebula, pions and thus neutrinos can be\nproduced (Bednarek and Protheroe, 1997).\nSupernova remnants:\nProtons may be shock accelerated and by means of collisions in the remnant may produce pions and thus neutrinos\n(Gaisser et al., 1998).\n\n\f2\nAGNs:\n-6\n\nIn active galactic nuclei (AGNs), protons may be shock accelerated either in the accretion disk of the central black hole\nor in the jets. Depending on the site of acceleration, either\nthe thermal photons of the accretion disk or the synchrotron\nradiation in the jet may serve as the target needed for pion\nproduction (e.g. Nellen et al. (1993); Stecker and Salamon\n(1996)).\nIt should be noted that the detection of neutrinos emitted\nby AGNs would be a smoking gun for hadron acceleration.\n\n3C 273 (core)\n\n-8\n\nCrab Nebula\n\nComa Cluster\n\nGalaxy clusters:\n\n-10\n\nThe ionized gas in a galaxy cluster might act as the target for\ncosmic rays escaping from cluster galaxies (Colafrancesco\nand Blasi, 1998).\nGRBs:\nProtons might be accelerated in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\n(e.g. Waxman and Bahcall (1997, 2000); De Paolis et al.\n(2001)). The main advantage of gamma-ray bursts is that\nthey allow a precise timing, which reduces the background\nconsiderably. In addition, assuming that two neutrinos emitted at the same moment in a GRB located at a distance d\narrive at different times t and t + \u2206t, one may compute the\nspeed difference \u2206v\u03bd of the two neutrinos by means of\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206t\nd\n\u2206v\u03bd\n\u221218\n.\n\u2248 10\nc\n10Gpc\n1s\n\nSNR IC 443\n\n-12\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFig. 1.

No neutrino flavor\noscillations are assumed.\n\n-5\n\nHence GRBs could offer a possibility for checking neutrino\ndispersion.\n-6\n\nFig. 1 shows the muon neutrino fluxes predicted for various source models, if no neutrino flavor oscillations are assumed.\n-7\nWB\n\n2\n\nNeutrino flux bounds\n\nThe multitude (and uncertainty) of neutrino source models\nsuggests the question whether one can obtain a generic upper neutrino flux bound, thus constraining the number of\nevents to be expected from future neutrino telescopes. In\norder to construct such a bound, we start by assuming that in\na neutrino source all protons are confined within the acceleration region (while neutrons and neutrinos may escape),\nthat there is a power law target photon spectrum with index \u03b1, n\u03b3 (E\u03b3 ) \u221d E\u03b3\u2212\u03b1 , and that the upper limit on the\ncosmic ray proton spectrum as observed on Earth has the\nform np,obs (Ep ) \u221d Ep\u22122.75 between 3 \u00d7 106 and 1012 GeV\n(Mannheim et al., 2001).\nParticle physics considerations then show that the neutrino\nproduction rate Q\u03bd\u03bc within the source is given by\n\u001a\n(if \u03b1 = 1)\n83.3Qn (25E\u03bd\u03bc )\nQ\u03bd\u03bc (E\u03bd\u03bc ) \u2248\n,\n(1)\n(if \u03b1 = 0)\n416Qn(25E\u03bd\u03bc )\n\n-8\n\nquasar\n\nGRB\n\n-9\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFig. 2. Generic muon neutrino and antineutrino flux bound for\nsources with low (\u03c4n\u03b3 < 1) and high neutron opacity (\u03c4n\u03b3 \u226b 1)\n(MPR flux bounds), and generic bound for neutrinos emitted by\nquasars (quasar), as obtained by Mannheim et al. (2001). The\nshaded region is the allowed range for the MPR flux bounds. Also\nshown are the generic GRB flux bound given by Mannheim (2001)\n(GRB) and the flux bound obtained by Waxman and Bahcall (1999)\n(WB). No neutrino flavor oscillations are assumed.\n\n\f3\nwhere Qn denotes the neutron production rate (Mannheim et\nal., 2001). The source contributes to the cosmic ray proton\nflux, if the neutron escape probability Pesc,n does not vanish.\nIndeed, the cosmic ray production rate can be estimated as\n(Mannheim et al., 2001)\nQcr (Ep ) \u2248\n\u2248\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4\nQn (Ep )\nQn (Ep ) \u00d7 Pesc,n (Ep ) \u2248\n\u03c4\n\u001a\n1\n(\u03c4 < 1)\nQn (Ep ) \u00d7\n.\n(2)\n\u03c4 \u22121\n(\u03c4 > 1)\n\nHere \u03c4 constitutes the neutron optical depth for the source\nradius. Finally, we note that the bolometric photon and neutrino luminosities are related by L\u03b3 = 2L\u03bd for \u03b1 = 1 and\nL\u03b3 \u2248 L\u03bd for \u03b1 = 0 (Rachen and M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, 1998).\nWe can now give a formal recipe for constructing generic\nupper flux bounds (Mannheim et al., 2001):\n1. Get the neutron production rate Qn . Note that due to the\nrescaling in step 4, Qn need to be known up to a factor\nof proportionality only.\n2. By means of Eqs. 1 and 2 compute the corresponding\nneutrino and cosmic ray proton production rates (i.e.\nQ\u03bd\u03bc and Qcr ).\n3. Integrate the neutrino and cosmic ray proton production\nrates over all sources in the universe to obtain the neutrino and cosmic ray proton intensities I at the Earth.\nFormally, this may be done using the formula\nI(E) \u221d\n\n1\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nzmax\n\nzmin\n\nM (E, z)\n\n(1 + z)2 dVc dPsource\n*\n4\u03c0d2L dz dVc\n* Q((1 + z)E, z)dz,\n\nwhere z denotes the redshift, dL the luminosity distance, Vc the comoving volume, and dPsource /dVc the\nsource density, which analogously to Qn in step 1 needs\nto be known only up to a factor of proportionality. The\nmodification factor M takes into account the attenuation processes along the line of flight. For neutrinos,\nM (E, z) = 1. The factor 1 + z in the argument of Q\ndescribes the energy degradation due to the expansion\nof the universe.\n4. Normalize Icr and thus I\u03bd\u03bc so that Icr is tangent to the\nobservational upper limit of the cosmic ray proton intensity or so that \u03b3-rays aren't overproduced (whichever is\nthe more stringent condition).\nIt should be noted that the bounds thus computed pertain to\nhadronic source models only, so that there might be an additional contribution from non-hadronic sources. One may\nnow use this recipe for computing various bounds:\nGeneric bounds (Mannheim et al., 2001) are obtained, if\none assumes that the neutron production spectrum is given\nby Qn (En ) \u221d En\u22121 exp(\u2212En /Emax ) with a cutoff energy\nEmax and that the source distribution follows that of galaxies and AGNs. The corresponding cosmic ray proton flux\n\nas a function of Emax is fitted to the observational bound.\nWe shall refer to these bounds as the Mannheim-ProtheroeRachen (MPR) flux bounds.\nIn order to get a bound for EGRET blazars (Mannheim et\nal., 2001), we assume that the production rate of accelerated\nprotons is of the form Qp (Ep ) \u221d Ep\u22122 exp(\u2212Ep /Emax ),\ncorresponding to non-relativistic Fermi acceleration, and that\nthe spectral index of the target photon spectrum has the value\n\u03b1 = 1. From Qp and the proton loss time scale one may compute the proton spectrum Np in the source, and from Np and\nthe timescale of p\u03b3 \u2212\u2192 n the neutron production rate Qn ,\nwhich may serve as the starting point for the general recipe\noutlined above. Here, as the production rates depend on the\nluminosity, the average over the luminosity function dN/dL\nis used:\nR\nQ\u03bd\u03bc ,cr (E, L) dN\ndL dL\nR dN\n.\nhQ\u03bd\u03bc ,cr (E)i =\ndL dL\n\nFor GRBs (Mannheim, 2001) one takes the spectrum of\naccelerated protons to be of the form Qp (Ep ) \u221d Ep\u22122 , but\nassumes that the photon target spectral index is given by \u03b1 =\n0. The calculation can then be carried out analogously to that\nfor the blazar bound.\nFinally, if it is assumed that the proton input spectrum is of\nthe form Qp (Ep ) \u221d Ep\u22122 and that the sources are optically\nthin for neutrons, one obtains the Waxman & Bahcall bound\n(Waxman and Bahcall, 1999).\nIn Fig. 2 various upper flux bounds for the muon neutrino\nflux from hadronic sources are shown.\n3 Event rates in neutrino telescopes\n\nThe decay of a charged pion leads to the production of one\nelectron and two muon neutrinos, where here and in the following no distinction between particles and antiparticles is\nmade. This implies that initially the ratio of the various neutrinos should be given by Q\u03bde : Q\u03bd\u03bc : Q\u03bd\u03c4 = 1 : 2 : 0.\nHowever, during the flight to Earth neutrino flavor oscillations should occur, leading to an equipartition among the\nvarious flavors (Learned and Pakvasa, 1995; Husain, 2000).\nHence the flux ratio as measured on Earth should have the\nvalue\nI\u03bde : I\u03bd\u03bc : I\u03bd\u03c4 = 1 : 1 : 1,\nso that a considerable amount of tauon neutrinos is to be expected, although virtually no tauon neutrinos are produced\nwithin neutrino sources. Neutrinos reaching a detector from\nbelow have to cross the inner Earth first. This propagation\ncan formally be described by means of the set (Hettlage and\nMannheim, 2001)\nX Z \u221e d\u03c3k\u2192i (E \u2032 , E)\ndI\u03bdi\n= \u2212\u03c3i,tot I\u03bdi +\nI\u03bdk (E \u2032 ), (3)\ndt\ndE\nE\nk\n\nof cascade equations, where \u03c3i denotes the total neutrino\ncross section of flavor i, the sum runs over all flavors, and\n\n\f4\n500\n\n15\n\n400\n\n10\n300\nWB\n\n200\n5\n\n100\nWB\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\ncos(nadir angle) bins\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\ncos(nadir angle) bins\n\nFig. 3. Event rates of muon (solid) and tauon neutrinos (dashed lines) for bins of the cosine of the nadir angle. Left: Event rates for the MPR\nflux bounds with high (\u03c4n\u03b3 \u226b 1) and low neutron source opacity (\u03c4n\u03b3 < 1). Right: Event rates for the Waxman & Bahcall flux bound.\n\nd\u03c3k\u2192i /dE covers both neutrino-nucleon and leptonic neutrino interactions, and the decay of tauons. For the parton\ndistributions we use the CTEQ5DIS functions (Lai, 2000),\nand we discretize the transport equations. The resulting set\nof equations can then be solved semi-analytically.\nAs a rough approximation to the event rate \u1e44 due to neutrino detection in water-based \u010cerenkov telescopes, we employ the formula\n\u0012Z \u221e\nd\u03c3 CC\n\u03c1Aeff\ndE \u2032 i \u2032 Ii (E \u2032 )Ldet\n\u1e44i (E) \u2248\nmp\ndE\nE\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nZ\nCC\nd\u03c3\n(i)\n(i)\ndE \u2032 i \u2032 (E0 (E \u2032 , x))Ii (E0 (E \u2032 , x)) . (4)\ndx\n+\ndE\nE\nL\nHere again i denotes the flavor. Aeff constitutes the effective\ndetector area, L the detector height, \u03c1 the matter density, and\n(i)\nmp the proton mass. E0 (E \u2032 , x) is the energy (of the lepton\ni) which is degraded to E \u2032 along a path of length x. In the\nfollowing, we shall assume Aeff = 1 km2 , L = 1 km, and\n\u03c1 = 1 g/cm3 .\nWhereas the first term on the right hand side of Eq. 4 describes fully contained events, the second term covers leptons originating outside the detector. It may be neglected for\nelectrons and tauons.\nFinally, it ought to be noted that the decay of tauons results\nin the production of both electrons and muons and hence contributes to the respective event rates.\n4\n\nResults\n\nThe formalism outlined in the previous section can be used\nto obtain the event rates corresponding to various of the flux\n\nbounds discussed in Sect. 2. This has been carried out for the\nWaxman & Bahcall and the MPR flux bounds. The results\n(for a lower energy cutoff of 100 GeV) are given in Fig. 3.\nAs in Fig. 3 different bins correspond to the same solid\nangle, the form of the curves is a direct measure of attenuation effects due to crossing the Earth. This suggests that one\nmight use the event rate as a function of the nadir angle in\norder to perform a tomography of the inner Earth (Jain et al.,\n1999).\nTo this end, we start by noting that the column density X\nmay be considered as the one-dimensional Radon transform\nof the number density \u03c1:\nZ\nX(p, \u03be) = \u03c1(r)\u03b4(p \u2212 \u03ber)d2 r.\n(5)\nHere, p and \u03be are the distance from the middle of the Earth\nand the normal vector of the line of integration, respectively.\nNow, using the inversion formula for two-dimensional Radon\ntransforms (Deans, 1993) one can show that X(p, \u03be) \u2261 X(p)\nand that one may thus invert Eq. 5 by means of\nZ +\u221aR2 \u2212r2\np\n1 d\nX( r2 + q 2 )dq,\n(6)\n\u03c1(r) = \u2212\n\u221a\n2\u03c0r dr \u2212 R2 \u2212r2\nwhere \u03c1(r) \u2261 0 for r > R. However, if the initial neutrino spectrum (before crossing the Earth) is assumed to be\nknown, one may deduce the column density directly from the\nobserved event rate. Then Eq. 6 yields the density, so that a\ntomography is indeed possible.\nUnfortunately, there is an important caveat: Due to the\nstatistical error \u03c3 in the detection rates, the column densities\ncan be known only with a rather limited precision. We take\nthis into account by either adding or subtracting \u03c3 throughout\nand comparing the results thus obtained with that for \u03c3 = 0.\n\n\f5\n15\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\nWB\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\nFig. 4. Left: Earth density \u03c1 as a function of the radius r obtained by performing a tomography on the event rates\np \u1e44 of Fig. 3 for the\nMPR p\nflux bound with high neutron source opacity. Shown are the results for no statistical error (solid), for \u1e44\u03bc \u00b1 \u1e44\u03bc (dashed), and for\n\u1e44\u03c4 \u00b1 \u1e44\u03c4 (dot-dashed lines). A lower energy cutoff of 100 GeV is assumed. For comparison the \"correct\" density according to Dziewonski\nand Anderson (1981) is included (dotted line). Right: Same as left figure, but for the Waxman & Bahcall flux bound.\n\nThe results of this analysis for a one-year run are shown in\nFig. 4 for an MPR and for the Waxman & Bahcall flux bound.\nOne can see that the maximum event rates to be expected for\nnext-generation neutrino telescopes put severe constraints on\na tomography of the inner Earth.\nAcknowledgements.
