The mentioned phenomena exhibit a variety of self-organized processes and\npatterns which are characterized by their time scales\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. A large number of in-vitro experiments have revealed that the motion of Kinesin is processive i.e., it performs stroke-type steps on its track\nbefore detachment [10, 11, 12]. It is now well established that the Kinesins motion is derived by the free energy released in the chemical hydrolysis reaction of ATP\n(adenosine-triphosphate). The fuel of the motion that\nis the ATP molecules arrive randomly in the vicinity of\nKinesins. Consequently, the directed motion takes place\non a stochastic grounds. During each step in which one\nperiod of the microtubule, hereafter referred to as MT,\nis covered, one ATP molecule is hydrolysed. The underlying mechanism responsible for this forward motion is\npartially understood. Two basic mechanisms have been\nproposed. In the first one the so-called inchworm mechanism, one head of Kinesin drag the other one which\nis always at the rear [13]. In this mechanism, there is\nan asymmetry between the lagging. The second mechanism which is called hand-over-hand has much resemblance to human walking. This mechanism involves repeated docking and undocking of both heads upon breaking of the chemical bond with the MT in the course of\nATP hydrolysis [14, 15]. At each stepping event, the rear\nhead executes a forward motion of 16 nm and attaches\nto the tubulin binding site ahead of the front head. Recent empirical evidences overwhelmingly have established\nthat hand-over-hand mechanism is the true mechanism\n[14]. In recent years various approaches have been proposed to model the directed motion of nano-sized bio motors. Simple random walk was used as a simple though\nefficient framework for modelling such kind of motion\n[16, 17, 18, 19]. In this framework, Kinesins are assumed\nto be point particles which execute a directed random\nwalk on a discrete one dimensional filament, as a model\n\nfor microtubular track, with lattice spacing equal to Kinesin walking distance i.e. 8 nm. Due to stochasticity in\nthe Kinesin motion, it would be reasonable to incorporate degrees of randomness in the modelling approach. In\nthis spirit, a new approach namely asymmetric particle\nhopping models in continuous time which are based on\nmaster equation approach came into play [17, 20, 21, 22].\nAnother theoretical approach for the modelling of bio motors motion is the so-called ratchet mechanism [4]. In this\nmechanism, the directed motion is generated by a timedependent periodic potential which is switched between\ntwo states [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. The stochasticity comes in the manner in which the potential switches\nfrom one state to the other one and reflects the random\narrival of ATP molecules and conformational transitions\nwhich changes the interacting potential between Kinesin\nand MT. In principle, more than one Kinesins can simultaneously move on a single MT. Kinesins do certainly\ninteract with each other. While the true interaction potential between adjacent Kinesins has not yet empirically\nexplored, in-vitro observations have revealed the collective motion of Kinesins which arises from the interaction\nbetween these motors [31]. In order to find some insight\ninto the nature of the Kinesins motion, we have developed a Langevin-type model which incorporates interaction among Kinesins. Our aim is to improve our understanding on the spatio-temporal organisations of intra\ncellular transport phenomena and find the mechanism\nresponsible for formation of molecular traffic jams.\nII.\n\nMODELLING OF KINESINS MOVEMENT\n\nThe model we have considered is a generalisation of the\nmodel proposed in [30] for the motion of a single Kinesin.\nWe shall now explain our stochastic ratchet model in\nsome details. The force acting on each Kinesin head consists of four terms as follows:\n~ ratchet \u2212 \u2207H\n~ bistable \u2212 \u2207H\n~ rep (\u2206r) + \u0393.\nF = \u2212\u2207H\n\n(1)\n\nHratchet is the stochastic ratchet potential which models the interaction between Kinesin and microtubule.\nHbistable is a bistable potential that models the elastic\n\n\f2\ncoupling between two heads of Kinesin, Hrep is the repulsive potential between adjacent Kinesins and finally\n\u0393 represents both the stochastic Brownian and the frictional forces experienced by Kinesin heads due to thermal\nnoise in the intra cellular environment. Let us explain\nthese four terms in more details.\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nRatchet potential\n\nHx\n\nA.\n\n0.4\n\nThe ratchet potential H(x, y, t) should involve an\nasymmetry along the MT. More precisely, we have taken\nthe form of ratchet potential as follows [30]:\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nH(x, y, t) = CHx (x)Hy (y)A(t)S(t)\n\n(2)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nx (nm)\n\nWith periodicity in x direction i.e., H(x + L, y, t) =\nH(x, y, t) where L is the microtubule period which is\nabout 8 nm. For Hx (x) we have used the first eleven\nterms of a Fourier series of an asymmetric function W (x)\nas follows:\n\nFIG. 1: Periodic dependence of Hx on x.\n\n0\n\n5\nX\n\n-2\n\n2\u03c0mx\n2\u03c0mx\n) + bm sin(\n) (3)\nHx (x) = a0 +\nam cos(\nL\nL\nm=1\n\n-4\n\nHy\n\nThe coefficients a0 , am and bm m = 1, * * * , 5 are\nFourier coefficients. For the asymmetric function W (x)\nwe chose the saw-tooth function:\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\nW (x) =\n\nx\n10 x\n( \u2212 [ ])\n9 L\nL\n\nx\nx\n\u2212 [ ] < 0.9\nL\nL\n\n-12\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nY (nm)\n\nW (x) = 10(\n\nx\nx\n\u2212 [ ]) \u2212 10\nL\nL\n\nx\nx\n\u2212 [ ] > 0.9\nL\nL\n\n(4)\n\nWhere [ ] denotes the integer part. The summation\nform of Hx (x) has been used for computational convenience. Figure (1) shows Hx (x) versus x .\nEach peak of Hx (x) is located at a distance 0.1L from\nthe position of the next minimum. For more details\nsee Ref. [30]. Concerning the part of potential Hy (y)\nresponsible for the perpendicular direction to the MT\nwe have used the following potential :\n\nHy (y) = \u2212\n\ny2\n\n1\n+ y02\n\n(5)\n\n\u221a\nwhere y0 = 0.1 L. It is assumed that the above form\nof Hy (y) can model the interaction between the molecules\nmaking up the Kinesin head and the MT. The symmetry of the function allows for detaching both in upward\nand downward directions perpendicular to the MT. This\nfunction is smoother than the Morse potential therefore\n\nFIG. 2: Dependence of Hy on the perpendicular direction y.\n\nwe can choose larger time steps which can speed up the\nsimulation. Figure (2) shows Hy .\nNow we shall discuss the time dependent terms i.e.,\nA(t) and S(t) of the Ratchet potential. The stochastic variable A(t) specifies the biochemical affinity of each\nKinesin head. It is a flashing potential which can switch\nbetween two discrete values A(t) = 0, 1. The value of\nA(t) depends on the biochemical status of the ATPase\nbinding site of the head. The biochemical cycle is divided\ninto four status.[14, 32, 33] In the first status, denoted by\nK, the ATPase binding site contains no ATP molecule.\nWhen an ATP molecules arrives at the binding site, the\nhead is said to be in its second status which is denoted by\nK.ATP. The third status is associated with the hydrolysis\nof the absorbed ATP into ADP plus an inorganic phosphate molecule Pi. This status is denoted by K.ADP.Pi.\nEventually after releasing the Pi molecule, the head is\ncharacterized by its fourth status K.ADP. The biochemi-\n\n\f3\n\n[H(x, y, t)]A(t)=1 \u2212 [H(x, y, t)]A(t)=0 \u2264 EAT P \u2192ADP +P i\n(6)\nB.\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\nH Bistable (eV)\n\ncal cycle is accomplished by releasing the ADP molecule.\nIn the status 1-3 the head has a high affinity (A = 1)\nto attach, or to keep its attached condition to the MT.\nOn the other hand, in the fourth status i.e., K.ADP the\naffinity will considerably reduced (A = 0) due to some\nconformational changes. The second term S(t) is related\nto the interaction between Kinesins. Besides biochemical\nstatus, each head can be either attached to the MT or\ndetached from it. Each head can attach only to particular sites on the MT. Since only one head can attach to\neach MT binding site, the potential seen by each head\ndepends on the occupancy of its adjacent MT binding\nsite. For adjacent Kinesins to MT, the stochastic variable S(t) describes the occupancy of the corresponding\nnearest binding site on the MT. It is zero if this site is\nalready occupied by another head and one otherwise (see\nFig.4 ). Parameter C is set at C = 0.01 eV . The value of\nconstant C determines the depth of the potential well. Its\nsize must be such that the energy difference between the\non-state (A=1) and the off-state (A=0) under the equilibrium condition is comparable with the energy released\nfrom the hydrolysis of the ATP i.e.,\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nr (nm)\n\nFIG. 3: Bistable potential between two heads vs distance. It\nmodels the elastic interaction between Kinesin heads.\n\nIn which \u2206r is the distance between the two heads,\nC1 = 0.12 eV is the amplitude of the potential and represents the coupling strength between heads, and l = 0.7L\nis the distance between the two potential minima. In the\nfollowing figure, we have sketched the dependence of the\nbistable potential versus distance.\n\nViscous and stochastic thermal noise terms\nD.\n\nThe force \u0393, which for simplicity acts in two dimension,\nhas the following structure:\n\u0393x = \u2212\u03b7 \u1e8b(t) + \u03bex (t).\n\n(7)\n\n\u0393y = \u2212\u03b7 \u1e8f(t) + \u03bey (t).\n\n(8)\n\nThe first term corresponds to energy dissipation due\nto viscosity of the surrounding fluid. \u03bex and \u03bey are stationary random Gaussian white noises with zero mean.\nMore precisely we have:\nh\u03bei (t)\u03bej (t\u2032 )i = 2\u03b7kB T \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03b4ij\n\nThe bistable potential\n\nThe bistable potential is responsible for the elastic coupling of the two Kinesin heads. This potential is expressed by the following form [29, 30]:\nHbistable (\u2206r) = C1 [1 + (\n\n\u2206r 4\n\u2206r 2\n) \u2212 2(\n) ]\nl\nl\n\nIn order to model the interaction between adjacent Kinesins, we introduce a short-ranged repulsive potential\nbetween heads of different Kinesins. More concisely, we\nhave used the shifted-force repulsive part of the LennardJones potential as follows:\nHrep (\u2206r) = U (\u2206r) \u2212 U (\u2206rc )\n\n(11)\n\nIn which U (\u2206r) = \u01eb( \u03c3r )6 with \u01eb = 0.2 eV, \u03c3 = 70 A0\nand the cut off length rc = 80 A0 . This repulsive potential prevents the heads of adjacent Kinesins from getting\ntoo close to each other.\n\n(9)\n\nThe drag coefficient \u03b7 for a Kinesin in an aqueous environment is reported at \u03b7 \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u22128 pN s/nm [24]. We\nhave taken this value for \u03b7 in this paper.\nC.\n\nThe potential between different Kinesins heads\n\n(10)\n\nE.\n\nsimulation details\n\nWe have not yet discussed in details how quantities A\nan S vary with time. To this end, we introduce a quantity\na(t) for each Kinesin's head which specifies whether at\ntime t the head is attached to the MT or not. a(t) is\none if the head is attached to a binding site and zero\notherwise. Before proceeding further let us specify when\nwe consider a head attached to a MT binding site. If at\nany time step, a head has a high affinity (A(t) = 1) and\nis located within a rectangular box with size \u03b4x = 3.8 nm\nand \u03b4y = 0.8 nm centred at a binding site of the MT then\nwe consider this head as an attached one.\n\n\f4\n\n300\n\nFIG. 4: For adjacent heads to MT, The ratchet potential is\nzero if the nearest binding site on the MT is already occupied\nby another head. A head is considered attached to a binding\nsite if it is in a small vicinity of that site.\n\nY(nm)\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n-100\n\nIII.\n\nSIMULATION RESULTS\n\nGenerically the Kinesin movement can be classified\ninto 3 states: resting, forward proccesive movement and\ndetachent/atachement to the MT. Once a Kinesin leaves\nL\nthe box from the vertical boundaries at y = \u00b1 2y its corresponding image re enters from the opposite side. Those\nKinesins which leave the last site in the x\u2212 direction at\ni = Lx re enter into the MT from the left site i = 1.\n\n-200\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nX(nm)\n\nFIG. 5: 2D trajectory of a typical Kinesin at \u03c1g = 0.4. Its\ncorresponding space-time plot is sketched in Fig.7.\n\n1000\n\nAvarage\n\n800\n\n600\n\nX (nm)\n\nNot we turn into A(t). Apparently the biochemical\ncycles of each head can be described by transition rates\nfrom one state to the other one. We assume that the average time that each head spends in the states K, K.ATP\nor K.ADP.Pi is in the order of ms when the head is attached to the MT [34, 35]. We note that this average time\ndepend on the attachment of the head and the position of\nits partner head. The average time a head spends in the\nfourth state K.ADP is much shorter and is in the order\nof \u03bcs [34, 36]. Since the rate of ATP consumption is considerably reduced when a head is detached [37, 38, 39],\nin our model we have assumed that only an attached\nhead received an ATP molecule. Moreover, we experimentally know the rate at which an attached head makes\na transition from the state K \u2192 K.ATP strongly depends\non the attaching state and position of its partner head\n[39, 40]. In case the partner head is attached and rear,\nthe above rate is lowered about two orders of magnitude.\nWe have tuned the corresponding rates in our code such\nthat the processivity and the average velocity of a single Kinesin coincides with the known empirical findings.\nConsequently, we used these adjusted rates in the collective motion of Kinesins. Periodic boundary condition\nhave been imposed and the Kinesins motion are assumed,\nfor simplicity, to be restricted to two dimension along x\nand y axes. The size of the simulation box was taken as\nfollows: Lx = 50 L, Ly = 40 L. The MT is located along\n\u2212L\nL\nthe x\u2212 axis at y = 0 and y \u2208 [ 2 y , 2y ]. Time step \u03b4t\n\u221210\nwas set to 5 \u00d7 10 s. The system has been simulated for\n3\u00d71010 timesteps in each run. The first 5\u00d7109 timesteps\nare discarded for reaching to equilibrium. Kinesin global\ndensity \u03c1g is defined as the number of Kinesins per binding site of the MT. Certainly \u03c1g can exceed one.\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n0\n\n200000\n\n400000\n\n600000\n\nt(\u03bcs)\n\nFIG. 6: Space-time plots of some Kinesins and the time dependence of their centre of mass at \u03c1g = 0.4.

We have found the CM velocity by fitting a linear\nline to the the curve as vcm = 0.5 \u03bcm/s.As can be seen,\nwhen a Kinesin is attached to the MT, its x component\nundergoes small fluctuations and is frequently increasing\nwith time. It rarely undergoes backward motion which\nis consistent with in-vitro experiments [8, 41, 42].\nOn the occasion of detachment from the MT, the Ki-\n\n\f5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n320\n\nCenter of mass\nHead 2\nHead 1\n\n300\n\n\u03c1g=0.02\n\u03c1g=0.2\n\u03c1g=0.4\n\u03c1g=0.6\n\u03c1g=0.8\n\u03c1g=1.0\n\n\u2217\n\nX(nm)\n\n2\n\nMSD (nm )\n\n280\n260\n240\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n220\n200\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n180\n600000\n\n650000\n\n700000\n\n750000\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n\nnesin performs a stochastic random motion, in the cytoplasmic environment, which is characterized by large\nfluctuations. It is a well-known fact that Kinesins are\nprocessive motors i.e., they can move directedly along\nthe filament for relatively large distances before detaching from it. Our model can successfully reproduce this\nbehaviour in the collective motion of Kinesins. To illustrate this behaviour, we have explicitly shown x component time dependence of the two heads as well as the\ncentre of mass for a typical Kinesin in the following figure.\nAs can be seen from Figure (7), the hand-over-hand\nmechanism of the directed motion is evident. In order to\nfind a better insight, we have evaluated the dependence\nof a single Kinesisn mean squared displacement (MSD)\non time. The MSD has been obtained by averaging over\nthe trajectories of all the Kinesins. Figure (8) depicts\nthe time behaviour of a single Kinesin' MSD for various\nglobal Kinesin concentration \u03c1g in a log-log plot.\nWe have evaluated the slopes by linear curve fitting.\nTo a very good approximation the diffusion is normal\nfor densities larger than \u03c1g \u223c 0.2 i.e., the MSD grows\nlinearly in time. It would be more appropriate to define\na line density \u03c1. This quantity is defined as the time\naverage number of bound Kinesins to the MT. Note that\na bound Kinesin can occupy two or one site of the MT\ndepending on whether one or two heads are attached. We\nhave sketched the dependence of \u03c1 on \u03c1g in Figure (9).\nWe observe a linear increase of \u03c1 up to \u03c1g = 0.4. Afterwards the rate of increase is lowered. This is due strong\nrepulsion between bound Kinesins. We stress that in order to have values of \u03c1 larger than 0.6 we have to significantly increase \u03c1g . This enormously rises the computational costs. We extrapolated the behaviour of the\ncurve for larger \u03c1. It turns out that \u03c1 tends to an asymptotic value near 0.7. More specifically, let us denote the\nnumber of those bound Kinesins attached via one head\nto MT by N1 and those attached via two heads by N2 so\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFIG. 8: Single Kinesin mean squared displacement versus\ntime for various densities.

The diffusion constant D turns out to be an increasing\nfunction of \u03c1. It grows slowly for small densities but shows a\nrapid increment for \u03c1 > 0.3. The reason is due to increase of\nunbound Kinesins when the density is enhanced.\n\nFIG. 11: Averaged CM velocity versus density \u03c1. hVx i is\na decreasing function of \u03c1.

In Figure (10) we\nexhibit the dependence of a single Kinesin diffusion coefficient D versus \u03c1. It grows slowly for small densities\nbut shows a rapid increment for \u03c1 > 0.3. The reason is\ndue to increase of unbound Kinesins when the density\nis enhanced. Obviously, an unbound Kinesin performs a\ndiffusive motion therefore increasing the number of unbound Kinesins gives rise to enhancement of the overall\ndiffusion which in turn leads to a larger D. Note that D\nhas been obtained by averaging over the trajectories of\nall the Kinesins.\nWe next turn into the issue of directed motion of\nKinesins. First, we have computed the dependence of\nthe averaged velocity of the CM versus \u03c1. Figure (11)\nsketches this behaviour.\nTo obtain the above graph, we plotted Xcm versus time\nand fitted a linear curve to it. The slope of the fitted\nline corresponds to the averaged velocity. As expected,\nhVx i is a decreasing function of \u03c1. For small densities\nit decreases smoothly. However, when the density goes\nbeyond \u03c1 = 0.2, hVx i shows a rapid decrease. In figure\n(12) we have exhibited the mean directed passage length\n(processive run length), the mean processive time and the\nvelocity of this directed motion on the MT as a function\nof \u03c1.\nThe average processive run length Lprs defined as the\naverage distance a Kinesin can move proccesively on the\nMT before detachment exhibits a rapidly decreasing behaviour up to \u03c1 = 0.4. After this value it shows a weak\ndependence on \u03c1. We speculate that at this density large\ntraffic jams are formed which do not allow Kinesins to\nmove directedly. The analogous behaviour is observed\nfor the mean temporal processivity T prs .

The analogous\nbehaviour is observed for the mean temporal processivity.\n\nsive motion. The average velocity has a more smooth decreasing behaviour. Having obtained the velocity of the\ndirected motion, we are able to find the dependence of the\ncurrent of Kinesins along the microtubule. The current\nJ is defined by the fluid mechanics relation J = \u03c1g V prs .\nFigure (13) sketches the dependence of J versus \u03c1.\nJ exhibits a maximum at \u03c1 \u223c 0.34. The interesting\npoint is the existence of an asymmetry in the J \u2212 \u03c1 diagram. Normally in lattice driven gas models such as\nasymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) J appears\nas a symmetric function of \u03c1 [43]. The current J is related to the rate of cargo transport by Kinesin motor proteins. In order to find a deeper understanding, we have\n\n\f7\nevaluated the steady state percentage of the bound and\nunbound Kinesins as a function of \u03c1. Bound Kinesins are\ndivided into two groups: one-head attached and two-head\nattached to the MT. Figure (14) exhibits this behaviour.\nPercentage of unbound Kinesins increases with density.\nIn the same manner, percentage of one-head attached Kinesins increases with \u03c1 but it seems to become saturated\nat large densities. Interestingly, percentage of two-head\nattached Kinesins shows a decreasing behaviour. The\nrate of decrease is small at low densities but becomes\nlarger for higher densities.\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\nJ\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\nIV.\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c1\n\n0.4\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUDING\nREMARKS\n\n0.6\n\nFIG. 13: Average Kinesins current versus density.

The model is capable of reproducing the hand-over-hand mechanism of the directed\nmotion along the microtubule. Various quantities such\nas diffusion constant, average velocity and the number\ncurrent of Kinesins have been obtained by performing\nextensive molecular dynamics simulations. Dependence\nof the above quantities on the the overall density of Kinesins have been obtained. It is shown that beyond a\ncertain density, the average velocity and the current undergo notable decrease which is due to formation of traffic\njams in the system.
