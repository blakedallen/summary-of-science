While the magnetic moments near\nthe stability line in the nuclear chart are well known, we\nhave only limited information on the magnetic moments\nfar from the stability line. Some of the challenges facing ground state nuclear moment measurements include\nthe small spin polarization and low cross sections encountered in the production mechanism for nuclei far removed\nfrom the stability line. It is important, however, to go far\nfrom the stability line in order to test predictive powers\nof theoretical models and to find possible variations of\nnuclear structure from the stability line.\nIn this Letter, we report the first measurement of the\nmagnetic moment of 57 Cu. Since 57 Cu has one proton\noutside of the 56 Ni core and the magnetic moment of T\n= 1/2 mirror partner 57 Ni is known, the current result\ncompletes the mirror pair and contributes important information for this shell region. The difficulties in the\nsmall polarization and low cross section were overcome by\nusing a proton pick up reaction of an intermediate-energy\nprimary beam. The small value for the 57 Cu magnetic\nmoment, discussed later in this paper, implies possible\nshell breaking at the neutron number N = 28.\nThe magnetic moment can be expressed as the sum of\nisoscalar h\u03a3\u03bc0 i and isovector h\u03a3\u03bcz i components as\n\u03bc = h\u03a3\u03bc0 i + h\u03a3\u03bcz i\n(1)\nlz + (\u03bcp + \u03bcn )\u03c3z\n\u03c4z {lz + (\u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn )\u03c3z }\n= \u03a3\n+ \u03a3\n,\n2\n2\nwhere l and \u03c3 are the orbital and spin angularmomentum operators of the nucleon, respectively, \u03c4 is the\nisospin operator, \u03bcp and \u03bcn are the magnetic moments of\nfree proton and neutron, respectively, and the sum is over\nall nucleons. The isovector h\u03a3\u03bcz i part is proportional to\n\nthe isospin, Tz , and changes its sign for T = \u00b1Tz . Provided that isospin is a good quantum number, the spin\nexpectation value h\u03a3\u03c3z i, which is a contribution from\nnucleon spins to the magnetic moment, can be extracted\n[1] from the sum of mirror pair magnetic moments as\nh\u03a3\u03c3z i =\n\n\u03bc(+Tz ) + \u03bc(\u2212Tz ) \u2212 I\n,\n\u03bcp + \u03bcn \u2212 1/2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the total spin is I = h\u03a3lz i + h\u03a3\u03c3z i/2. In the sd\nshell, all of the ground state magnetic moments of T =\n1/2 mirror nuclei have been measured and there remain\nseveral T = 1 and 3/2 isospin multiplets to be measured.\nThere exists, however, virtually no information regarding similar T = 1/2 pairs in the f p shell. A systematic\ntrend of the spin expectation value depending on the shell\nstructure has been observed [1, 2], which gave firm understanding of the shell structure for T = 1/2 mirror\npairs. On the other hand, in the f p shell only few mirror\nmagnetic moments are known (41 Ca-41 Sc and 43 Sc-43 Ti\npairs [3]) and therefore it is essential to measure more\nmagnetic moments in this region in order to explore the\nevolution of nuclear structure in the f p shell and above.\nBecause 57 Cu consists of the closed-shell 56 Ni core plus\none proton, \u03bc(57 Cu) is one of the most important among\nmirror nuclei in the f p shell.\nThe long chain of magnetic moments of odd-mass Cu\nisotopes has been measured over 2p3/2 , 1f5/2 and 2p1/2\nneutron shells (from the mass A = 59 through 69). It\nwas reported [4] that a shell model calculation systematically overshoots the experimental data. The \u03bc(59 Cu)\nwas measured [4] to be even smaller than that of the shell\nmodel calculation and that of the prediction based on the\nsystematics of local mirror pairs [5]. It is predicted that\nthe 56 Ni core is soft [6] and that any deviation from the\nshell model is a direct proof of a higher order configuration mixing and/or a shell breaking at 56 Ni. In this\nregard, the measurement of \u03bc(57 Cu) is essential because\n\n\f2\nonly one proton is outside the 56 Ni closed core and the\nsingle particle contribution is expected to be strong.\nThe experiment was performed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University. The 57 Cu ions were produced\nfrom a primary beam of 58 Ni accelerated up to 140\nMeV/nucleon by the coupled cyclotrons and impinging\non a 423 mg/cm2 9 Be target. A charge pick up reaction\n(58 Ni + p \u2192 57 Cu + 2n) was employed to produce 57 Cu\nbecause a large nuclear polarization can be expected at\nthe central momentum of the fragment [8], where the production rate is higher, although the two-neutron evaporation may reduce the final nuclear polarization. The\nprimary beam was set at an angle of +2\u25e6 relative to the\nnormal beam axis at the production target in order to\nproduce a polarized beam. The 57 Cu ions were separated\nfrom other reaction products by the A1900 fragment separator [7]. The full angular acceptance (\u00b12.5\u25e6 ) was used.\nAn achromatic wedge (300 mg/cm2 Al) was placed at the\nsecond intermediate dispersive image for a separation of\n57\nCu based on relative energy loss in the wedge. The\ncentral momentum of the 57 Cu beam was chosen with a\n1% momentum acceptance to optimize the polarization.\nThe magnetic rigidity of the dipole magnets were B\u03c1 =\n3.0372 and 2.6477 Tm for the first and second segments of\nthe A1900, respectively. A typical counting rate of 57 Cu\nat the experimental port was about 350 particles/s/pnA\nand 5 pnA primary beam was available. The major contaminations were 55 Co and 56 Ni. However, because of\ntheir longer lifetimes and lower \u03b2-ray end-point energies,\nthey did not impact the \u03b2-NMR measurement.\nThe polarized 57 Cu ions were delivered to the \u03b2-NMR\napparatus [9], first passed in air and implanted into a\nsingle-crystal NaCl, which was 2 mm in thickness and\ntilted by 45\u25e6 relative to the \u03b2-detector surface. An external magnetic field of H0 = 0.2 T was applied parallel to\nthe direction of polarization to maintain the polarization\nin the crystal. 57 Cu decays to the levels of 57 Ni emitting \u03b2 + rays with a half life of 196.3 ms. The branching\nratio to the ground state (I \u03c0 = 3/2\u2212) is 89.9% and the\nmaximum \u03b2-ray energy is 7.75 MeV with an asymmetry\nparameter of A = +0.75 [11] and 8.6% of 57 Cu decays\nto the 1112.6 keV excited state (I \u03c0 = 1/2\u2212). The \u03b2\nrays from stopped 57 Cu were detected by a set of plasticcounter telescopes (double coincidence) placed 0\u25e6 (u) and\n180\u25e6 (d) relative to the holding field direction. Because\nof the asymmetric \u03b2-ray angular distribution from the\npolarized nuclei, W (\u03b8) \u223c 1 + AP cos \u03b8, the counting rate\nbetween u and d counters is asymmetric depending on the\npolarization P , A and the angle \u03b8 between the direction\nof \u03b2 ray and the polarization axis.\nPrior to the NMR scan, an H0 on and off technique\n[12] was applied in order to deduce the polarization\nof 57 Cu in NaCl. The double ratio between up and\ndown counters with (on) and without (off) H0 , R =\n(Nu /Nd )on /(Nu /Nd )off \u223c 1 + 2AP , gives the asymmetry\nchange, assuming that the polarization is not maintained\nin the NaCl without H0 . However, an uncertainty in R\n\ncaused by the switching on and off of H0 is introduced\ndue to the effect of H0 on the photomultipliers. Therefore, the double ratio was normalized by the null polarization measurement, R\u03b8=2\u25e6 /R\u03b8=0\u25e6 , where the primary\nbeam angle was set at 0\u25e6 . Typically, R\u03b8=0\u25e6 = 0.96(1)\nand 0.936(9) for H0 = 0.1 and 0.2 T, respectively, were\nobtained. As a result shown in Fig. 1 (a), an asymmetry\nchange of about 0.95 was observed at H0 = 0.2 T and\nno polarization at 0.1 T. Considering the positive A and\nassuming the near-side dominant reaction, the sign of\nthe polarization is negative, where the direction defined\nby the momenta of the primary beam and the fragment,\nki \u00d7 kf , is taken to be positive.\nIn the NMR measurement, a radio-frequency (rf) on\nand off technique [9] with continuous 57 Cu implantation\ninto the NaCl was employed. The frequency-modulated\n(FM) rf was applied to the 57 Cu in NaCl every 60s\nthrough an rf coil, which made up an LCR circuit. Typical FM, rf time to sweep the FM and the amplitude were\n\u00b1 50 kHz, 20 ms and 0.3 mT, respectively. The asymmetry change extracted from the ratio between rf off and\non, R = (Nu /Nd )off /(Nu /Nd )on , was measured as a function of the applied frequency, \u03bd. The \u03bc is deduced from\nthe relation h\u03bd = \u03bcH0 /I. All the measurements were\nperformed at room temperature and in the air.\nSeveral sets of NMR measurements were performed\nwith different settings of H0 and FM. The NMR spectrum measured at H0 = 0.2020 \u00b1 0.0003 T with FM =\n\u00b150 kHz is shown in Fig. 1 (b), where the asymmetry\nchange is plotted as a function of the magnetic moment.\nThe applied frequency is also shown on the top axis. A\nresonance was observed around \u03bc = 2\u03bcN . The amplitude\nand sign of the resonance are consistent with the result\nof the H0 on/off measurement shown in Fig. 1 (a) within\nstatistical error. The hatched area is a base line obtained\nfrom weighted sum of all the data except the resonance\npoint. A positive peak around \u03bc = 2.5\u03bcN was not considered a resonance because the sign of the asymmetry\nis different from the H0 on/off. Unfortunately the measurement at H0 = 0.15 T with narrower FM = \u00b125 kHz\nwas not conclusive as shown in Fig. 1 (c), which is due\nto the smaller polarization at 0.15 T expected from the\nresult of the H0 on/off shown in Fig. 1 (a) and the poorer\nstatistics. Thus only the results taken at H0 = 0.2 T will\nbe used in the analysis hereafter. The observed asymmetry change at the resonance point was 0.929 \u00b1 0.018,\nwhich is 3.9\u03c3 number (99.99% confidence level). From\nthe applied frequency of 2050 \u00b1 50 kHz to the resonance\npoint, the magnetic moment is obtained as\n|\u03bc(57 Cu)| = (2.00 \u00b1 0.05)\u03bcN ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the error is from the FM only and the value is\nnot corrected for the chemical shift, which is not known.\nHowever, the chemical shifts of Cu in cuprous halides\nare known and they are about -1500 ppm [10], where a\ndiamagnetic direction is taken to be positive (\u03bc(57 Cu)\nwould shift by \u22120.003\u03bcN).\nThe present result is shown in Fig. 2 in solid circle\n\n\f3\nFrequency (kHz)\n1400\n\n(a)\n\nFreq.

The dotted line and open squares are the results from\nshell-model calculation in Ref. [4], where the 56 Ni core\nis assumed to be principally a closed-shell nucleus and\nthe authors include the effects of core polarization, meson exchange current, isobars, and relativistic corrections\nin perturbation theory. For the residual interaction, the\none-boson exchange potential with a short-range cut-off\nwas used. From the systematic deviation of \u03bc(Cu) from\nthe calculation, a massive shell-breaking at 56 Ni has been\nsuggested [4]. The open circle is a theoretical calculation\n[11], where 3p-2h excitation was allowed in the f p shells\nand FPD6 effective interaction was used. These calculations give values around \u03bc(57 Cu) = 2.45\u03bcN and do not\nreproduce the present result. In a calculation [6] using an\neffective interaction GXPF1 in the full f p shell, the result is \u03bc(57 Cu) = +2.5345\u03bcN with free nucleon g factors,\nwhich is shown as open-inverse triangle in the Fig. 2. If\nthe effective g factors are used, gseff = 0.9gsfree , gleff = 1.1\nand \u22120.1 for protons and neutrons, respectively, which\nimproves the agreement between experimental data of\nNi and Zn magnetic moments in Ref. [6], the result is\n\u03bc(57 Cu) = +2.4897\u03bcN. Again the calculation gives a\nlarger magnetic moment. The open triangles in Fig. 2 are\npredictions [5] based on systematics of known magnetic\nmoment and of the f t-value of their mirror partners for\nthe mass A = 57 and 59 systems, respectively. The experimental data are smaller but follow the trend of systematic values. The experimental and theoretical magnetic\nmoments of 57 Cu and 57 Ni are summarized in TABLE I.\nThe agreement between experiment and theory for 57 Cu\nis not good, whereas the agreement is good for the magnetic moment of mirror partner 57 Ni.

The open triangles are\npredictions based on the systematics [5].\n\neffective g factor, for example gseff = 0.75gsfree used in the\nanalysis of the g factors of the first 2+ excited state in\nZn isotopes [13], gives closer value \u03bc(57 Cu) = +2.27\u03bcN\nto the experiment, although the agreement for \u03bc(57 Ni)\nbecomes worse. The considerably smaller \u03bc(57 Cu) would\nimply significant shell breaking at 56 Ni with N = 28.\nTogether with the known magnetic moment of the mirror partner \u03bc(57 Ni) = (\u22120.7975\u00b10.0014)\u03bcN [14], the spin\nexpectation value is extracted as\nh\u03a3\u03c3z i = \u22120.78 \u00b1 0.13,\n\n(4)\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: Magnetic moments of 57 Cu-57 Ni and the spin expectation value of the mass A = 57 system.\na\n\nexp\nexpc\ntheord\ntheore\ntheorf\nsystg\nSchmidt\n\n\u03bc(57 Cu)\u03bcN\n2.00 \u00b1 0.05\n2.48\n2.40\n2.49\n2.49 \u00b1 0.03\n3.79\n\n\u03bc(57 Ni)\u03bcN\n-0.7975 \u00b1 0.0014\n-0.71\n-0.79\n-1.91\n\nh\u03a3\u03c3z i\n-0.78 \u00b1 0.13b\n0.71\n0.51\n0.51 \u00b1 0.08\n1\n\na Present\n\nwork.\npresent work and Ref.

The smaller \u03bc(57 Cu) results in a\nlarge deviation and opposite sign in h\u03a3\u03c3z i from the shell\nmodel calculations. Considering the systematic behavior\nof the h\u03a3\u03c3z i of T = 1/2 nuclei in the sd shell, where the\nvalues of h\u03a3\u03c3z i are restored close to the single-particle\nvalues around the shell closures, the present result indicates that 57 Cu is at the middle of the shell evolution\ntowards the shell closure and that there is a significant\nshell breaking at 56 Ni with N = 28. Systematic studies\nof the spin expectation value towards the N = 50 shell\nclosure (1g9/2 ) are of great interest.\n\nFIG. 3: Spin expectation value of known T = 1/2 pair in the\nf pg shell. The solid circles are the experimental data, open\nsquare is from [11] and the open circle from [6]. The Schmidt\nvalues are indicated by the solid lines.\n\nIn summary, the magnetic moment of ground state\nCu was measured for the first time by the \u03b2-NMR\ntechnique. The 57 Cu ions were produced from a 140\nMeV/nucleon 58 Ni beam at the NSCL/MSU impinging\non a Be target and purified by the A1900 fragment separator. A charge pick up reaction followed by two neutron\nevaporation was employed. A large nuclear polarization,\nP \u223c \u22123%, at the central momentum of the fragment was\nobtained, where the 57 Cu was implanted into a singlecrystal NaCl. In the NMR measurement, a resonance\nat an applied frequency of 2050 \u00b1 50 kHz was observed,\nwhere the external magnetic field was 0.2020 \u00b1 0.0003\nT. The obtained magnetic moment is |\u03bc(57 Cu)| = 2.00 \u00b1\n0.05 \u03bcN , for which the chemical shift is not considered.\nThe shell model calculations available for 57 Cu generally\ngive \u03bc(57 Cu) = 2.45 \u03bcN and the agreement with the experiment is not good, whereas the experimental \u03bc(57 Ni)\nis well reproduced. The use of the effective g eff factor\nmakes the agreement better for 57 Cu but not for 57 Cu\nand 57 Ni simultaneously. The spin expectation value was\nextracted together with the known \u03bc(57 Ni) as h\u03a3\u03c3z i =\n\u22120.78 \u00b1 0.13. Again, the agreement with the theoretical\nvalue, h\u03a3\u03c3z i \u223c0.5, is not good. The present results imply\na significant shell breaking at 56 Ni with N = 28.\n\nwhere the sign of \u03bc(57 Cu) is assumed to be positive. In\nTABLE I the spin expectation values for the mass A = 57\nsystem are summarized and plotted in Fig. 3, where the\nexperimental data are shown by the solid circles. There\nare only three T = 1/2 mirror pairs known in the f p\nshell, namely 41 Ca-41 Sc, 43 Sc-43 Ti, and 57 Ni-57 Cu pairs.\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation Grant PHY 01-10253 and PHY 9983810.
