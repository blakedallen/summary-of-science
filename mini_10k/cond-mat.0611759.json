Our results\nhave relevance both to experiments in circuit cavity QED, as well as to nano-electromechanical\nsystems.\nPACS numbers:\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThere has been a recent explosion of interest in the\nproperties of quantum oscillators. On one hand, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) (systems comprising\nof a micron scale oscillator coupled to an electronic conductor) have been used for near quantum-limited position\ndetection, and are thought to be good candidates for the\npreparation of exotic quantum states and for use in quantum control experiments [3]. On the other hand, there\nhas been considerable success in studying circuit QED\nsystems, in which a superconducting qubit is strongly\ncoupled to a single mode in an electromagnetic resonator\n[4, 5, 6]. Experiments in these systems have been able to\nenter the strong coupling regime of cavity QED, achieving such milestones as the resolution of the vacuum Rabi\nsplitting [5].\nA clear goal in both these classes of systems is to reach\na regime where the quantum nature of the resonator is\nunambiguously manifest in measured experimental quantities. An example of this would be the observation of\nfeatures associated with the discrete energy states of the\noscillator. This was recently achieved in spectacular fashion in the circuit QED system with a so-called \"number\nsplitting\" experiment [7]. It was experimentally shown\nthat for a strong dispersive coupling between the qubit\nand the mode, the qubit dephasing spectrum (i.e. the\ntime-dependence of the qubit's off-diagonal density matrix element) could be used to probe the photon number\ndistribution in the cavity mode. Theoretically, this effect\nwas first described by Dykman for the case of a undriven,\nthermal mode [1]. More recently, Gambetta et al. [2]\ndescribed the effect for the case of a zero-temperature\ndriven mode, a case more relevant to the experiment of\nRef. 7.\nIn the case of NEMS systems, there have been several theoretical proposals for measuring discrete number\nstates, but to date these have been difficult to implement\nexperimentally [8, 9, 10]. Given the success of the circuit\nQED number splitting experiment [7], it is natural to ask\nwhether a similar approach could be taken with NEMS\nsystems. In principle, the answer is yes. The coupling\n\nof nanomechanical oscillators to superconducting qubits\nhas been discussed extensively [11, 12, 13] and is being\nactively pursued experimentally. One could thus easily\nenvisage a setup where a superconducting qubit is coupled to both a electromagnetic cavity and a nanomechanical oscillator [9, 14]. The mechanical oscillator would\nbe strongly coupled to the qubit and would generate the\nnumber splitting effect, while the electromagnetic cavity would be weakly coupled and would be used simply\nto read out the qubit dephasing spectrum. The idea of\nusing the approach of Ref. 7 to detect number states in\na nano-mechanical oscillator is highly attractive. From\nan experimental perspective, it is not as demanding as\nprevious proposals (e.g. strong non-linearities in the oscillator are not required). In addition, we will see that\nsuch an experiment offers the possibility of providing an\nunambiguous signature of the discrete number states of\nthe oscillator; no extensive post-experiment interpretation is required.\nThe above discussion notwithstanding, there remain\nunresolved theoretical issues with the number splitting\neffect that should be addressed before contemplating a\nNEMS version of the experiment. These issues are also\nrelevant to the circuit-QED experiment of Ref. 7. First,\nas NEMS oscillators do not typically have frequencies\nmuch larger than temperature, one should now consider\nboth the effect of finite temperature and a driving force;\nthis regime is not addressed by existing theory [1, 2]. In\nthis paper, we calculate analytically the qubit dephasing\nspectrum for a qubit dispersively coupled to a driven, finite temperature oscillator, using a conceptually simple\nWigner function approach. We recover the previous results in the appropriate limits. Our results also provide\nanalytic expression for the long-time oscillator-induced\ndephasing rate of the qubit in the driven, thermal case\n(c.f Eqs. (44) and (69)). Note that the dephasing rate in\nthe absence of a drive was considered recently by Serban\net al. in Ref. 15.\nA second important issue we address here is the question of measurement fidelity: to what extent is the qubit\ndephasing spectrum a faithful measurement of the mode's\nnumber statistics? It was already pointed out in Refs. 2, 7\n\n\f2\nthat for a generic driving force, there was not a simple\nconnection between the observed peaks in the qubit dephasing spectrum and the photon number distribution in\nthe mode. We demonstrate that in general, back-action\neffects arise from the finite damping of the oscillator;\nthese imply that the dephasing spectrum of the qubit\nwill fail to perfectly reflect the initial photon distribution of the oscillator. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that\nfor a sufficiently strong oscillator-qubit coupling, one can\nreliably extract the initial photon distribution of the oscillator.\nII.\n\nWe consider a qubit which is dispersively coupled to a\nharmonic oscillator. Ignoring for the moment the damping and driving of the oscillator, the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem is given by:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\nHere, ~\u03a9qb is the energy splitting of the qubit, \u03a9 is the\noscillator frequency, and \u03bb is a dimensionless measure of\nthe interaction strength. As discussed, e.g. in Ref. 4, an\ninteraction of this type can arise from a Jaynes-Cumming\ntype coupling in the limit where the frequency difference |\u03a9qb \u2212 \u03a9| is large (i.e. one transforms the starting\nHamiltonian to eliminate the first-order qubit-mode interaction; the dispersive interaction above then results\nat second order in the original coupling strength). It has\nrecently been suggested [15] that it is important to keep\nnon-rotating terms in the interaction Hamiltonian Hint\n(i.e. terms proportional to a2 and (a\u2020 )2 ). We find that\nsuch terms play no role in the weak damping, weak coupling limit of interest (i.e. \u03bb \u226a 1, \u03b3/\u03a9 \u226a 1); we discuss\nthis further in what follows. Note that in this limit, the\neffects of the qubit-oscillator interaction may still be significant, as \u03bb\u03a9/\u03b3 can be large.\nThe quantity we wish to study is the qubit's offdiagonal density matrix element. Letting | \u2191i, | \u2193i denote\n\u03c3z eigenstates and \u03c1\u0302 the density matrix of the oscillatorqubit system, we define:\n\u03c1\u0302\u2191\u2193 (t) = \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) \u2261 h\u2191 |\u03c1\u0302(t)| \u2193i\n\u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) = Trosc \u03c1\u0302\u2191\u2193 (t)\n\n\u0393abs (\u03c9rf ) = |A|2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndte+i\u03c9rf t h\u03c3\u2212 (t)\u03c3+ (0)i\n\u0014Z \u221e\n\u0015\n2\n+i\u03c9rf t\n= 2|A| Re\ndte\n\u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nHere, the second line assumes the quantum regression\ntheorem, and A is a matrix element proportional to the\nstrength of the driving field.\n\nHEURISTIC DISCUSSION OF THE\nNUMBER SPLITTING EFFECT\n\nH = H0 + Hint\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~\u03a9qb\n1\nH0 =\n\u03c3z + ~\u03a9 a\u2020 a +\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nHint = \u03bb~\u03a9 a\u2020 a +\n\u03c3z\n2\n\na scheme, one attempts to excite the qubit from its\nground state via a time-dependent field at frequency \u03c9rf\nwhich couples to \u03c3x . Within Fermi's golden rule and\nthe quantum regression theorem [17], the absorption rate\n\u0393abs (\u03c9rf ) is given by:\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nNote that \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) is indeed a measurable quantity; one\ncould imagine extracting it using state tomography,\nas has recently been demonstrated for superconducting qubits [16]. An alternate method, as discussed in\nRefs. [1, 2] and used in the experiment of Ref. 7, is to\nmeasure \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) via an absorption experiment. In such\n\nA.\n\nNumber splitting interpretation of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t)\n\nThe simplest expectation for the behaviour of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t)\nfollows from the observation that a) this quantity should\noscillate at the qubit splitting frequency, and b) the dispersive coupling in Eq. (3) implies qubit splitting frequency depends on the number of quanta in the mode.\nThis leads to the expected form:\n\u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) = e\u2212i\u03a9qb t\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nP (n)e\u22122i\u03bb\u03a9(n+ 2 )t \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (0)\n1\n\n(7)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere P (n) is the number distribution of the harmonic\nmode. Eq. (7) would of course be exact in the absence of\ndamping or forcing of the oscillator. It tells us that the\ntime-dependence of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 at a fixed coupling strength contains information about the oscillator photon number distribution at t = 0: if one Fourier-transforms \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t), one\nexpects a set of discrete peaks with a spacing \u2206\u03c9 = 2\u03bb\u03a9,\nwith the weight of each peak yielding the probability\nP (n) of the corresponding number state.\nIn the more general case where we have to contend\nwith damping and forcing of the oscillator, Eq. (7) is\nno longer a priori valid. The interaction Hint now fails\nto commute with the total oscillator Hamiltonian, and\nthus there will be a back-action associated with the measurement. Heuristically, turning on the coupling to the\nqubit can now itself cause a change in the number statistics of the oscillator. For example, the coupling to the\nqubit causes the oscillator's frequency to change; at nonzero damping, this will cause it to re-equilibrate with the\nbath and thus change its number distribution. We can\nnonetheless attempt to use Eq. (7) to extract the number\nstatistics of the oscillator (i.e. use the weights of peaks in\nthe spectrum of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 to extract the distribution of number\nstates in the oscillator). We will thus refer to Eq. (7) as\nthe \"number splitting\" interpretation of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 ; in what follows, we will assess the validity of such an interpretation.\n\n\f3\nB.\n\nFull counting statistics interpretation of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (\u03bb)\n\nA second, somewhat different way to connect \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) to\nnumber statistics is to use the coupling dependence of this\nquantity (as opposed to its time dependence) to extract\nthe oscillator number statistics. This is the procedure\nused in defining the full counting statistics of transmitted charge in mesoscopic electron conductors [18].

In this limit, one can start with an\nexact path-integral description and then rigorously derive a local-in-time equation of motion for \u03c1\u2191\u2193 ; this is\nin complete analogy to the derivation of the usual weakcoupling Caledeira-Leggett master equation [19]. This\nequation can also be rigorously justified in the high temperature kB T \u226b ~\u03a9 limit.

As the additional quantum\nterms are at most quadratic in x, p and their derivatives,\n\nwe may solve this equation in the same way one would\nsolve the classical Fokker-Planck equation: one makes a\nGaussian ansatz. Note that a similar approach was used\nrecently by Serban et al. [15] to study the dephasing of\na qubit by a thermal, damped mode.\n\n\f4\nThus, we write:\nW (x, p) =\n\nZ\n\ndk\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\ndq ikx iqp f\ne e W (k, q)\n2\u03c0\n\n(13)\n\nand make the Gaussian ansatz:\n\nf (k, q; t)\nW\n= ei\u03bd eik\u2206x0 *x\u0304+iq\u2206p0 *p\u0304 \u00d7\n(14)\nf (0, 0; 0)\nW\nh 1\nexp \u2212 k 2 (\u2206x0 )2 \u03c3x + q 2 (\u2206p0 )2 \u03c3p\n2\n\u0001i\n+2kq(\u2206x0 )(\u2206p0 )\u03c3xp .\n\nThe Gaussian is parameterized by six time-dependent\nparameters: the means x\u0304(t), p\u0304(t), the variances \u03c3x (t)\nand \u03c3p (t), the cross-correlation \u03c3xp (t) and the overall\nphase \u03bd(t); note that we have scaled all quantities by\nthe zero-point variances of the oscillator. Substituting\nthe above ansatz into the appropriately transformed version of Eq.

The \u03bbindependent terms describe the usual dynamics of a\ndriven dissipative oscillator, and have a completely classical form. The \u03bb-dependent terms act as quantum source\nterms, and cause the means and variances of the Gaussian to acquire imaginary parts. From Eq. (20), we find\nthat the decay of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 is determined from these quantities:\nf (k = 0, q = 0; t)\nW\n\u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t)\n=\nf (k = 0, q = 0; 0)\n\u03c1\u2191\u2193 (0)\nW\n= \u039b1 (t) * \u039b2 (t)\n\n(22)\n\nwith\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u03bb t \u2032\n\u039b1 (t) = exp \u2212i\ndt (\u03c3x (t\u2032 ) + \u03c3p (t\u2032 ))\n2 0\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03bb t \u2032 2 \u2032\n2 \u2032\n\u039b2 (t) = exp \u2212i\ndt x\u0304 (t ) + p\u0304 (t )\n2 0\n\nDEPHASING SPECTRUM IN THE PURELY\nTHERMAL CASE\n\n(20)\n\n(15)\n\n= \u03c3p \u2212 \u03c3x \u2212 \u03b3\u03c3xp \u2212 i\u03bb\u03c3xp (\u03c3x + \u03c3p )\n\nIV.\n\nWe first consider the case of zero drive (i.e. F (t) = 0),\nand take the oscillator to initially be in a thermal state:\nx\u0304 = p\u0304 = 0, \u03c3x = \u03c3p = T\u0303 , and \u03c3xp = 0. Note that this\ncorresponds to an oscillator in equilibrium with frequency\n\u03a9; one might argue that for the absorption experiment,\nthe initial condition should correspond to an equilibrium\noscillator with frequency \u03a9 \u2212 \u03bb. This difference is easy\nto include; in the weak coupling limit of interest (\u03bb \u226a\n1), the corrections are lower-order in \u03bb and hence notsignificant.\nAs there is no drive, Eqs. (15) and (16) imply x\u0304 = 0,\np\u0304 = 0 for all time, and thus the factor \u039b2 (t) = 1. The\nevolution of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 is the completely determined by the factor \u039b1 (t). To proceed with the analysis, it is convenient\nto write:\n\n= p\u0304 \u2212 i\u03bb (\u03c3x x\u0304 + \u03c3xp p\u0304)\n\u0001\n\nThe two factors above correspond to two distinct contributions to the decay of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 , and hence to the number splitting effect. The factor \u039b1 (t) describes a purely\nthermal effect: from Eqs. (17) and (18), we see that\n\u03c3x and \u03c3p acquire negative imaginary parts, causing\n\u039b1 (t) to decay from its initial value of 1. This effect\nonly occurs at finite temperature, as at zero temperature\n\u03c3x (0) = \u03c3y (0) = T\u0303 = 1 and are hence time independent.\nNote that \u039b1 (t) is completely independent of the means\nof the Gaussian (i.e. x\u0304 and p\u0304) and hence of the driving\nforce F (t).\nIn contrast, the factor \u039b2 (t) in Eq. (22) describes the\neffect of a finite drive on \u03c1\u2191\u2193 : if the means x\u0304 and p\u0304 are\nnon-zero, Eq. (15)-(16) indicate that they will acquire an\nimaginary part and cause this factor to decay.\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nThe equations for the Gaussian parameters thus become:\nd\u03bd\n= \u03bb(1 + s\u0304)\ndt\n\u0003\n\u0002\nds\u0304\n2\n= \u2212i\u03bb 2s\u0304 + s\u03042 + (\u2206s)2 + \u03c3xp\ndt\n\u2212\u03b3(s\u0304 \u2212 \u2206s) + 2\u03b3 n\u0304eq\nd\u2206s\n= \u22122i\u03bb(1 + s\u0304)(\u2206s)\ndt\n+\u03b3(s\u0304 \u2212 \u2206s) \u2212 2\u03b3 n\u0304eq + 2\u03c3xp\nd\u03c3xp\n= \u2212\u03b3\u03c3xp \u2212 2\u2206s \u2212 2i\u03bb\u03c3xp [1 + s\u0304]\ndt\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n(30)\n\nAs we start in a thermal state, both \u2206s(0) = 0 and\n\u03c3xp (0) = 0; further, if we took the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0, these\nquantities would remain zero for all time. Thus, in the\nweak damping (\u03b3 \u226a 1) limit of interest, it will be an\nexcellent approximation to set \u2206s = \u03c3xp = 0 in Eq. (28);\n\n\f5\nthis results in the approximate equation:\n\u0003\n\u0002\nds\u0304\n= \u2212i\u03bb 2s\u0304 + s\u03042 \u2212 \u03b3 (s\u0304 \u2212 2n\u0304eq )\ndt\n\n(31)\n\nWithin this approximation, \u039b1 (t) is completely determined by Eq. (31) and Eq. (27). Note crucially that our\napproximation does not amount to doing perturbation\ntheory in \u03bb or \u03b3, as terms to all orders in the ratio \u03bb/\u03b3\nare retained. Also note that if one had started by using\nthe quantum optics version of Eq. (9) (i.e. drop all a2 and\n(a\u2020 )2 terms), one would immediately find Eq. (31) without any additional approximation. We thus see that the\ndifferences between the Linblad and non-Linblad forms\nof the master equation play no role in the weak coupling,\nsmall damping limit of interest. In what follows, we will\nexplicitly discuss the correction terms that arise when\none uses the full equation Eq. (28) versus the approximate version Eq. (31).\nA.\n\nResults for dephasing spectrum\n\nWe can now solve directly Eq. (31) for s\u0304.

(23) and (32) we find:\n\u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t)\n= \u039b1 (t)\n\u03c1\u2191\u2193 (0)\n1\u2212M\n(35)\n1 \u2212 M e\u22122i\u03bb\u03b1t\n\u221e\nX\n= e\u03b3t/2 (1 \u2212 M )\nM n e\u2212i(2n+1)\u03bb\u03b1t (36)\n\n= e\u03b3t/2 e\u2212i\u03bb\u03b1t\n\nn=0\n\nNote that the result above coincides exactly with Eq. (11)\nin Ref. 1. Unlike that work, we did not start by making\na rotating-wave approximation in the bath-oscillator interaction, but instead took a weak-damping limit.\nConsider first the \u03b3 \u2192 0 limit. In this limit, one finds\nM = e\u2212\u03b2\u03a9 and \u03b1 = 1. Eq. (36) thus yields \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) in\nthe form of Eq. (7) with a thermal number distribution.\nAs expected, \u03c1\u2191\u2193 is a completely faithful measure of the\noscillator number statistics in this limit, as there is no\nback-action: at zero damping, the mode has no way to\nre-equilibrate its number distribution in response to a\nchange in its frequency.\n\nIn the case of small but finite \u03b3, we see that |M | will\nplay the role of the Boltzman weight e\u2212\u03b2\u03c9 , and that \u03b1\nacts to renormalize the coupling \u03bb. For small damping,\nthe Fourier spectrum of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) will again consist of a set\nof equally-spaced discrete peaks occurring at frequencies\n\u03c9n . The peaks will now have a Lorentzian form, each\nhaving a non-zero width \u03b3n . To leading order in \u03b3 we\nhave:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u0010 \u03b3 \u00112\n\u03c9n = (2n + 1)\u03bb 1 +\nn\u0304eq (1 + n\u0304eq ) (37)\n2 \u03bb\n\u03b3n = \u03b3 [n\u0304eq + n(1 + 2n\u0304eq )]\n(38)\nFurther, to order \u03b3 2 , the weighting factor |M | is given\nby:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b32\n(39)\n|M | \u2243 e\u2212\u03b2\u03a9 1 \u2212 2 (1 + 2n\u0304eq )\n4\u03bb\nWe can use |M | to define an effective temperature Tef f\nvia |M | \u2261 e\u2212~\u03a9/(kb Tef f ) . This is the temperature one\nwould associate with the oscillator based on using Eq. (7)\nto interpret the peaks in the spectrum of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t). To leading order in \u03b3/\u03bb, we have:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b3 2 kB T\nTef f = T \u00d7 1 \u2212 2\n(1 + 2n\u0304eq )\n(40)\n4\u03bb ~\u03a9\nThus, in the weak-but finite damping limit, the probability distribution extracted from the time dependence of\n\u03c1\u2191\u2193 at fixed coupling strength \u03bb \u226b \u03b3 (i.e. using Eq. (7))\nis very close to the initial, equilibrium photon number\ndistribution of the oscillator. Note that there is a one-toone correspondence between the peaks in the spectrum\nand the peaks expected from Eq. (7). The main effect\nof the damping is to give the peaks associated with each\nnumber state a finite width in frequency. There is also\ndeviation between the weight of each peak and a pure\nthermal weight; the finite damping makes the oscillator\nappear somewhat colder than it should. On a heuristic\nlevel, it is not difficult to understand why we have a correspondence. The time-scale for back-action effects to\nset in is \u223c 1/\u03b3\u2013 this is how long the oscillator takes to\nre-equilibrate its number distribution given the change\nin frequency brought on by the coupling to the qubit.\nFor \u03bb \u226b \u03b3, the qubit effectively \"measures\" the number\nstatistics well before they have a chance to be changed\nby the back-action.\nB.\n\nResults for oscillator-induced dephasing rate\n\nIt is also interesting to consider the limiting behaviour\nof \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) in the long-time limit, t \u226b 1/\u03b3. We can define\nthe long-time dephasing rate \u0393\u03c6,th and frequency shift\n\u2206th of the qubit via:\nlog \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t)\nt\nlog \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t)\n\u2261 \u2212Re lim\nt\u2192\u221e\nt\n\n\u2206th \u2261 \u2212Im lim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0393\u03c6,th\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\n\f6\nThis yields:\n\u2206th = Re\u03bb\u03b1\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ees\n\u00132\n\u0012\n8i\u03bb\n2i\u03bb\n\u03b3\n+\nn\u0304eq \uf8fb\n1+\n= Im \uf8f0\n2\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\n\u2212 Im\u03bb\u03b1\n2 \uf8ee\n\uf8f9\ns\u0012\n\u00132\n8i\u03bb\n\u03b3\n2i\u03bb\n+\n= Re \uf8f0\nn\u0304eq \u2212 1\uf8fb\n1+\n2\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\n(43)\n\n\u0393\u03c6,th = \u2212\n\nHint,2 =\n\n(44)\n\nWe find that the thermal oscillator-induced dephasing\nrate may be written as \u03b3 times a function which depends\nonly on the ratio \u03bb/\u03b3 and the temperature; in typical\nexperimental situations, one has both \u03b3 \u226a 1 and \u03bb \u226a\n1, but the ratio \u03bb/\u03b3 can be arbitrary. Note also that\nthe thermal dephasing rate of the qubit vanishes at zero\ntemperature.

This can be understood\nfrom the fact that higher order terms in \u03bb become increasingly important at higher temperatures; the Golden\nrule result is only valid if \u03bbn\u0304eq /\u03b3 \u226a 1 is satisfied.\nEqs. (44)-(47) for the thermal dephasing rate are\nvalid within the small-damping approximation made in\nEq. (31), or equivalently, within a rotating-wave description of the bath-oscillator coupling. One can also find\n\u0393\u03c6,th without making these approximations by solving\nthe full Eqs. (27)-(30) for a stationary s\u0304. Results are\ngiven in the Appendix. One again finds that the thermal\ndephasing rate vanishes at zero temperature, and has the\nsame high-temperature limit as Eq. (47). One also finds\nthat corrections to the result Eq. (44) are higher-order\nin \u03b3. If we keep the ratio \u03b3/\u03bb fixed and expand in \u03b3, we\nfind:\n[\u0393\u03c6,th ]f ull = \u0393\u03c6,th + O(\u03b3 3 )\n\nThis confirms our prior claim that the error introduced\nby the approximation of Eq. (31) is small in the weak\ndamping \u03b3 \u226a 1 limit.\nFinally, we have also calculated the thermal dephasing\nrate for a qubit-oscillator interaction Hamiltonian which\ncontains counter-rotating wave terms, i.e. :\n\n(49)\n\n\u00012\n\u03bb~\u03a9\na + a\u2020\n2\n\n(50)\n\nThe thermal dephasing rate of the qubit for the interaction Hamiltonian Hint,2 was previously considered by\nSerban et al. [15]. Using a completely analogous procedure as the above, we can find the oscillator induced\ndephasing rate of the qubit with this modified interaction; results are provided in the appendix. As expected,\nwe find that corrections to the result of Eq. (44) are negligible in the \u03b3, \u03bb \u226a 1 limit of interest.\nV. DEPHASING SPECTRUM IN THE\nPRESENCE OF AN OSCILLATOR DRIVE\n\nWe now consider the additional effect of a driving force\nF (t) on the oscillator. The thermal factor \u039b1 (t) considered in the previous section will be unchanged by the\npresence of the force, assuming the initial state of the\noscillator has variances consistent with being in equilibrium. However, because of the drive, the means of the\nGaussian (i.e. x\u0304 and p\u0304) will be time-dependent; as a result, the factor \u039b2 (t) (c.f. Eqn. (24)) will also contribute\nto the suppression of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) and to the number splitting\neffect. To characterize this, we must calculate x\u0304(t) and\np\u0304(t).\nWe begin by writing:\n1\n(x\u0304(t) + ip\u0304(t))\n2\n1\na2 (t) = (x\u0304(t) \u2212 ip\u0304(t))\n2\n\na1 (t) =\n\n(51)\n(52)\n\nNote that in general, a1 (t) 6= [a2 (t)]\u2217 as x\u0304 and p\u0304 have\ncomplex parts; we only have a1 (t) = [a2 (t)]\u2217 at t = 0,\nwhen both x\u0304 and p\u0304 are real. Also note that with our\nrescaling, a1 and a2 correspond to the usual a for a harmonic oscillator. As x\u03042 + p\u03042 = 4a2 a1 , we have:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ t\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndt a2 (t )a1 (t )\n(53)\n\u039b2 (t) = exp \u22122i\u03bb\n0\n\nNote the similarity to Eq. (5.16) in Ref. 2. In the positive\nP-function approach used in that work, it was important\nto have a different coherent states associated with the\ntwo states of the qubit (| \u2191i, | \u2193i). In our approach, this\n\"doubling\" of degrees of freedom manifests itself in the\nfact that x\u0304 and p\u0304 have both real and imaginary parts\n(i.e. a2 6= (a1 )\u2217 ).\nWe use Eqs. (15) and (16) to obtain equations for a1\nand a2 . Assuming the drive is near the oscillator frequency \u03a9, and that \u03bb \u226a 1, it is safe to make a rotating wave approximation to these equations. Writing\n\n\f7\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF (t) = Re F e\u2212i\u03c9d t , we thus find (recall we have set\n\u03a9 = 1):\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\ni\n\u03b3\n\u03c3x + \u03c3p\nd\na1 + F+ (t) (54)\na1 = \u2212i \u2212 \u2212 i\u03bb\ndt\n2\n2\n2\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nd\ni\n\u03b3\n\u03c3x + \u03c3p\n\u2217\na2 \u2212 [F+ (t)] (55)\na2 = i \u2212 \u2212 i\u03bb\ndt\n2\n2\n2\nwhere F+ (t) = F e\u2212i(\u03c9d \u22121)t . We see that due to the coupling \u03bb, the average variance \u03c3x (t) + \u03c3p (t) acts as a timedependent modulation of the oscillator frequency. This\naverage variance is again completely determined from\nEq. (28) of the previous section, and is completely independent of the force F (t) or the initial value of a(t).\nIn addition, as we have seen, it will have an imaginary\npart.\nThe above equations are easily solved to yield:\nZ\ni t \u2032\na1 (t) = g1 (t, 0)a1 (0) +\ndt g1 (t, t\u2032 )F+ (t\u2032 ) (56)\n2 0\nZ\ni t \u2032\n\u2217\ndt g2 (t, t\u2032 ) [F+ (t\u2032 )] (57)\na2 (t) = g2 (t, 0)a2 (0) \u2212\n2 0\nwith\n\nThe parameters M and \u03b1 are temperature dependent,\nand are given by Eqs. (33) and (34) respectively. Note\nthat g1 and g2 are not time-translational invariant, as\nthey are sensitive to the initial time t = 0 at which the\ncoupling was turned on. Also note that in the zero temperature limit, we have M \u2192 0 and \u03bb\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bb \u2212 i\u03b3/2.\nThe propagators g1 and g2 then reduce to the expected\npropagators for a damped oscillator having a frequency\nof \u03a9 \u00b1 \u03bb. The propagators also have this form at long\ntimes (t1 \u03b3, t2 \u03b3 \u226b 1) in the finite-temperature case.\nWe can now write a1 (t) and a2 (t) as:\na1 (t) = a1,s * e\u2212i\u03c9d t + \u00e31 (t)\n\na2 (t) = a2,s * ei\u03c9d t + \u00e32 (t)\n\nHere, \u00e31 (t) and \u00e32 (t) describe the transient behaviour of\na1 and a2 . This decomposition then allows us to write\nthe drive-dependent contribution to \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t), \u039b2 (t), as:\n\u039b2 (t) \u2261 exp [\u2212i\u2206dr t \u2212 \u0393\u03c6,dr t] \u00d7 exp [Qtrans (t)]\nwhere\n\u2212 i\u2206dr \u2212 \u0393\u03c6,dr \u2261 \u22122i\u03bba1,s a2,s\nZ t h\nQtrans (t) \u2261 \u22122i\u03bb\ndt\u2032 \u00e31 (t\u2032 )\u00e32 (t\u2032 )\n0\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ng1 (t, t\u2032 ) = e\u2212i(t\u2212t ) e\u2212\u03b3(t\u2212t )/2 \u00d7\n(58)\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\nZ t\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03c3x (t ) + \u03c3p (t )\ndt\u2032\u2032\nexp \u2212i\u03bb\n2\nt\u2032\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ng2 (t, t\u2032 ) = ei(t\u2212t ) e\u2212\u03b3(t\u2212t )/2 \u00d7\n(59)\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\nZ t\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03c3\n(t\n)\n+\n\u03c3\n(t\n)\nx\np\nexp \u2212i\u03bb\ndt\u2032\u2032\n2\nt\u2032\n\nEqs. (53), (56) -(59) are enough to completely determine the drive contribution \u039b2 (t) to the decay of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t).\nIn the limit of zero temperature, there is no thermal\ncontribution to the decay of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (i.e. there is no zerotemperature dephasing), and \u03c3x = \u03c3p = 1 for all times.\nThis corresponds to the limit considered in Ref. 2; as\nwe will see, the current approach yields the same answer\nfound in that work. In the more general case of a nonzero temperature, the thermal number splitting will also\ninfluence the \"drive\" contribution to the number splitting, through the dynamics of \u03c3x (t) + \u03c3p (t).\nTo proceed, we make use of the small-\u03b3 solution for\ns\u0304(t) obtained in the previous section (c.f. Eq. (32)). We\nstress again that this result would be exact if one started\nby making a rotating wave approximation in Eq. (9),\nas is commonly done in the quantum optics community. We also stress that corrections to this approximation are negligible in the weak-damping, weak coupling\n(\u03bb \u226a 1, \u03b3 \u226a \u03a9) limit of interest. We thus find:\n\u22122i\u03bb\u03b1t2\n\n1 \u2212 Me\n1 \u2212 M e\u22122i\u03bb\u03b1t1\n1 \u2212 M e\u22122i\u03bb\u03b1t2\ng2 (t1 , t2 ) = ei(1\u2212\u03bb\u03b1)(t1 \u2212t2 )\n1 \u2212 M e\u22122i\u03bb\u03b1t1\n\ng1 (t1 , t2 ) = e\u2212i(1+\u03bb\u03b1)(t1 \u2212t2 )\n\n(60)\n(61)\n\n(62)\n(63)\n\n\u2032\n\n(64)\n(65)\ni\n\u2032\n\n+a1,s \u00e32 (t\u2032 )e\u2212i\u03c9d t + a2,s \u00e31 (t\u2032 )e+i\u03c9d t\n\nWe thus see that the long time behaviour of a1 , a2 will set\nthe drive contribution \u0393\u03c6,dr to the dephasing rate of the\nqubit (i.e. the exponential decay of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 at long times),\nwhile the transient behaviour of these two functions will\nbe (presumably) responsible for the number splitting effect.\nA.\n\nResults for the drive contribution to the\ndephasing rate\n\nIn the presence of a drive, the total dephasing rate of\nthe qubit (i.e. the exponential decay rate of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) at long\ntimes) will be given by:\n\u0393\u03c6 = \u0393\u03c6,th + \u0393\u03c6,dr\n\n(66)\n\nThe purely thermal contribution \u0393\u03c6,th is given in\nEq. (44). Using the results of this section, we can calculate the drive contribution to the dephasing rate. One\nfirst finds the stationary amplitudes a1,s and a2,s .

(43)); to lowest order in \u03b3, \u2206th = \u03bb. Note that the\nstationary amplitudes are temperature-dependent!\n\n\f8\nUsing these expressions, and letting \u03b3th \u2261 (\u03b3 +2\u0393\u03c6,th),\nwe find that the drive-dependent contribution to the\nqubit dephasing rate takes the form:\n\n\u0393\u03c6,dr =\n\n|F |2\nh\n2 (\u03b4 + \u2206th )2 +\n\n\u03bb\u2206th \u03b3th\nih\n(\u03b4 \u2212 \u2206th )2 +\n\n\u0001\n\u03b3th 2\n2\n\n\u0001\n\u03b3th 2\n2\n\n1.\n\nIn the zero temperature limit, we have B1 = B2 = 0,\nand:\ni\n\n(69)\n\nNote that at zero temperature, \u2206th = \u03bb and \u0393\u03c6,th = 0.\nIn this limit, Eq.

We have thus shown\nthat at zero temperature, one can reliably extract the\ninitial number distribution of the driven oscillator (arbitrary detuning \u03b4) from the time-dependence of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 using the \"number splitting\" interpretation of Eq.

Note that one may still have\n\u03bb \u226a 1. It is worth emphasizing that the initial condition\nwe consider here (i.e. Hint = 0 before t = 0) is not appropriate for the absorption experiment of Ref. 7.

We have thus shown that in the \"strong measurement limit\" \u03bb \u226b \u03b3, \u03b4, the spectrum of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) accurately reflects the number statistics of the mode: in this\nlimit, each peak in the spectrum of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 corresponds to a\nnumber state in the mode, and the corresponding peak\nweight to P (n).

One also expects from\nEq. (7) that the weights of the different peaks peaks in\nthe spectrum should correspond to the oscillator number distribution. These weights may be approximately\nobtained from S(\u03c9) via:\nZ (2m+1)\u03bb\n1\nd\u03c9S(\u03c9)\n(87)\nP (m)approx = \u221a\n\u03c0 hm (2m\u22121)\u03bb\nwhere hm is the maximum of S(\u03c9) in the interval\n[(2m \u2212 1)\u03bb, (2m + 1)\u03bb)]. Number distributions obtained\nfrom S(\u03c9) using this procedure are shown in Fig. 2.\nNote that one could be more sophisticated in extracting\nthe weights of peaks from S(\u03c9); we use Eq. (87) only for\nsimplicity.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have used a conceptually simple\nWigner function approach to study the physics of a qubit\ndispersively coupled to a driven, thermal harmonic mode.\nIn general, back-action effects prevent the qubit's dephasing spectrum (i.e. the Fourier spectrum of \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t)) from\n\n\f10\n0.08\n\n4000\na. \u03bb=0.003\n\nS(\u03c9)\n\n3000\n\ntrue\n\n0.07\n\n2000\n\n\u03bb=0.1\n\n0.06\n\n\u03bb=0.01\n\n1000\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nP(m)\n\n0.05\n0\n\u22121\n\n0.04\n0.03\n\nS(\u03c9)\n\n0.02\n\nb. \u03bb=0.01\n\n1500\n1000\n\n0.01\n\n500\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nm\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nS(\u03c9)\n\n1500\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2: Number distributions derived from the dephasing\nspectrum, using the same oscillator parameters as in Fig. 1.\nThe black bars correspond to the actual photon number distribution associated with the initial oscillator state.

Eq. (86)) for different values of \u03bb. For each plot, we\nhave taken the oscillator damping \u03b3 = 10\u22124 , a driving force\nof magnitude |F | = 3\u03b3 and detuning \u03b4 = 0, a temperature\nwhich corresponds to n\u0304eq = 1, and an initial condition which\ncorresponds to the driven thermal oscillator at zero qubitoscillator coupling. Based on the number splitting interpretation of Eq. (7), one expects to see peaks in S(\u03c9) whenever\n\u03c9 = 2\u03bb. For small values of \u03bb, S(\u03c9) is in poor correspondence to the number distribution; note that there are additional peaks occurring roughly at \u03c9 equal to odd multiples of\n\u03bb. These unwanted peaks become increasingly insignificant\nas \u03bb is increased. The weights of the peaks in plot c) are in\ngood agreement with the expected number state distribution\nfor the initial oscillator state (see Fig. 2).\n\nbeing a perfect mirror of the number statistics of the initial oscillator state. We have shown however that for\na sufficiently strong qubit-oscillator coupling, one can\nindeed reliably extract the photon distribution of the\ndriven, thermal mode from the dephasing spectrum. We\nhave also calculated the oscillator-induced dephasing of\nthe qubit in the case of a thermal, driven mode.\nWe thank Alexandre Blais and Mark Dykman for useful conversations.

(9), using\na weak-damping approximation. As discussed, this approximation is equivalent to having dropped terms proportional to a2 and (a\u2020 )2 in Eq. (9), as is often done in\nthe quantum optics literature; this approximation was\nalso used in Refs. 1, 2. In this section, we discuss corrections arising when one goes beyond this approximation.\n\n1.\n\nResults from the full, non-Linblad master\nequation\n\nIf one retains the counter-rotating terms in Eq. (9),\none finds corrections to the result Eq. (44). These corrections are irrelevant in the small damping, small coupling\n(\u03b3, \u03bb \u226a 1) limit of interest. Explicitly, expanding \u0393\u03c6,th\nin \u03b3 for a fixed \u03bb, one finds that corrections to Eq. (44)\nonly arise at order \u03b3 3 :\n[\u0393\u03c6,th ]f ull = \u03b3 n\u0304eq \u2212\n3\n\n(A1)\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03b3 1 \u2212 3\u03bb + 4\u03bb\nn\u0304eq (1 + n\u0304eq )(1 + 2n\u0304eq )\n4\u03bb2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )2\n\n+O(\u03b3 5 )\n\n\f11\nComparing against the corresponding expansion of the\napproximate answer, Eq. (46), we see that the correction\nterms arising from using the full equation are suppressed\nby a factor \u03bb2 compared to the order-\u03b3 3 terms in approximate answer..\nSimilarly, if we expand the full answer to lowest order\n\u03bb, we find that corrections to Eq. (48) are suppressed by\n\u03b32:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b32\n2 4n\u0304eq (1 + n\u0304eq )\n1+\n+ O(\u03bb4 )\n[\u0393\u03c6,th ]f ull = \u03bb\n\u03b3\n4\n(A2)\n2.\n\nResults for a counter-rotating qubit-oscillator\ninteraction\n\nOne can also calculate the thermal dephasing rate of\nthe qubit using an qubit-oscillator interaction Hamiltonian which retains counter-rotating terms, c.f. Eq. (50).\nIt was recently suggested that such terms could play a\nsignificant role [15]. Repeating the treatment which led\nto the full dephasing rate above (i.e. no small damping\napproximation), we obtain:\n\nwhere\n\n[\u0393\u03c6,th ]Hint,2 =\n\uf8ee s\n\uf8f9\n\u00132\n\u0012\n2\n\u03b3\n8i\u03bb\n\u03b3\n2i\u03bb\n+\nRe \uf8f0A\nn\u0304eq \u2212\n\u2212 1\uf8fb(A3)\n1+\n2\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n4\n\n2\n(A4)\nA = q\np\n2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 + 2 1 + 4i\u03b3\u03bb(2n\u0304eq + 1) \u2212 4\u03bb2\n\nAPPENDIX B: NUMBER STATISTICS FOR A\nDRIVEN THERMAL MODE\n\nIn this appendix, we calculate the generating function\nfor the number distribution for a driven harmonic oscillator which is also coupled to an equilibrium dissipative\nbath. The Wigner function for such a state will be a\nGaussian, with the variances determined by equipartition. The means of the Gaussian will follow the equations\nof motion for a damped, driven oscillator. In general, we\ncan represent this state in the form:\n\u03c1driven = D\u0302\u03c10 D\u0302\u22121\n\nwhere \u03c10 is the equilibrium density matrix of the oscillator, and D\u0302 is the displacement operator:\n\u0001\nD\u0302 = exp \u03b10 \u00e2\u2020 \u2212 \u03b1\u22170 \u00e2\n(B2)\nFinally, \u03b10 is the coherent state amplitude corresponding\nto the driven, damped motion of the oscillator; only its\nmagnitude will be important for the number statistics.\nWe have:\n|\u03b10 |2 =\n\n|F |2 /4\n(\u03c9d \u2212 \u03a9)2 + \u03b3 2 /4\n\n(B3)\n\nTo proceed, it is useful to represent \u03c10 using a P function:\nZ\n\u03c10 =\nd\u03b1P0 (\u03b1)|\u03b1ih\u03b1|\n(B4)\nP0 (\u03b1) =\n\n\u0001\n1 \u03b2~\u03a9\n(e\n\u2212 1) exp \u2212|\u03b1|2 (e\u03b2\u03a9 \u2212 1) (B5)\n\u03c0\n(B6)\n\nNote that this expression is identical to the previous\nEq. (44) except for terms which are small as \u03b3 or \u03bb. To\nsee this explicitly, we can expand this result for small \u03bb\nto obtain:\n\nIt thus follows:\nZ\n\u03c1 =\nd\u03b1P0 (\u03b1)|\u03b1 + \u03b10 ih\u03b1 + \u03b10 |\n\n[\u0393\u03c6,th ]Hint,2 =\ni\n\u03bb2 h\n2\n4n\u0304eq (1 + n\u0304eq ) + \u03b3 2 (1 + 2n\u0304eq ) + O(\u03bb4 )(A5)\n\u03b3\n\nThe number distribution is then given by:\n\nThe second term above corresponds to the correction\ncoming from using the non-rotating wave interaction\nHamiltonian; it is suppressed by a factor \u03b3 2 . Thus, as\nclaimed, the non-rotating terms in the qubit-oscillator\ninteraction Hamiltonian Hint play no role in the weak\ndamping, weak coupling (\u03bb \u226a 1, \u03b3 \u226a \u03a9) limit of interest.

The\nsecond term corresponds to the effect of a non-zero temperature. In the absence of the Bessel-function factor, it\nwould yield the generating function for a thermal distribution. In the presence of a drive, the Bessel-function\nfactors modifies the form of this term. Thus, not surprisingly, the number statistics of a driven thermal oscillator\nis not simply a convolution of a Bose-Einstein distribution with a Poisson distribution.\nWe can evaluate the expression for P (k) further by\nmaking use of:\nI0 (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nz 2l\n4l (l!)2\n\n(B12)\n\nl=0\n\nand\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\ndrr1+2m e\u2212Ar =\n\nm! \u2212m\u22121\nA\n2\n\nSome algebra thus yields:\n\nP (k) = Ptherm (k) \u00d7 Pdrive (k) \u00d7 Pcorr (k) (B14)\nwith\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2\u03a9\n(B15)\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2\u03a9 eik\n\u0002\n\u0003\nPdrive (k) = exp \u2212|\u03b10 |2 (1 \u2212 eik )\n(B16)\n\u221e\nX |\u03b10 |2l e\u2212l\u03b2\u03a9\n\u00012l\n1 \u2212 eik\nPcorr (k) =\nl\n\u2212\u03b2\u03a9 eik )\nl=0 l!
