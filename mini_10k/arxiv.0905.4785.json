INTRODUCTION\n\nThe overall origin of cosmic rays (CR), in particular at\nultra high energies, above 1018 eV, is still an unresolved\nproblem in astrophysics (e.g. Nagano & Watson 2000;\nStanev 2004; Cronin 2005; Inoue 2008). Understanding\nthis origin requires the determination of the astrophysical objects, that are the CR sources, and of the appropriate acceleration processes, that form the CR spectrum\nin these objects. During the last several years considerable progress has been achieved in this field, both experimentally and theoretically. Recently the sharp steepening of the CR spectrum above 3 \u00d7 1019 eV was established in the HiRes (Bergman et al. 2007) and Auger\n(Yamamoto et al. 2007) experiments. It presumably\ncorresponds to the so-called Greizen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin\n(GZK) cutoff, caused by energy losses of the CRs in\ntheir interactions with the microwave background radiation. This is evidence that the highest energy part of\nthe CR spectrum is of extragalactic origin. It was also\nrecently demonstrated (Berezhko & V\u00f6lk 2007) that the\nCRs with energies up to \u01eb \u223c 1017 eV can be produced in\nsupernova remnants (SNRs) as a result of diffusive shock\nacceleration (Krymsky 1977; Bell 1978), and that the\nobserved CR energy spectrum can be well represented\nby two components: the first, dominant up to 1017 eV,\nconsists of CRs produced in Galactic SNRs; the second,\ndominant at energies above 1018 eV, is of extragalactic\norigin. The latter component can be produced at the\nshock that is formed by the expanding cocoon around\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs): above the energy 1018 eV\nthe overall energy spectrum of CRs, produced during\nthe AGN evolution and released into intergalactic space,\nhas an appropriate power law form, which extends at\nleast up to the energy \u01ebmax \u223c 1020 eV, well above the\nGZK cutoff (Berezhko 2008). This is the \"dip scenario\"\nElectronic address: berezhko@ikfia.ysn.ru\n1 Yu.G. Shafer Institute of Cosmophysical Research and Aeronomy, 31 Lenin Ave., 677980 Yakutsk, Russia\n\nof the overall CR spectrum formation (Berezinsky et al.\n2006). Within the alternative \"ankle scenario\", extragalactic CRs are expected to dominate only above the\nenergy 1019 eV (Berezinsky et al. 2006). It was noted\n(Berezhko & V\u00f6lk 2007; Berezhko 2008), that the composition of CRs at \u01eb > 1017 eV is expected to be very\ndifferent in these two scenarios. Therefore the study of\nCR composition can in principle provide the signature of\nthe acceleration mechanism which creates the spectrum\nof extragalactic CR component.\nHere we present the calculations of the expected composition of CRs, accelerated by cocoon shocks and\ndemonstrate that it has well pronounced peculiarities,\nwhich can be considered as a signature of ultra high energy CR production by nonrelativistic shocks. The calculated composition is compared with the composition\nexpected within the alternative scenario and with the\nexisting data. The alternative scenario, which suggests\nreacceleration increasing the energy of CRs produced in\nSNRs by a factor of 30, is also examined.\n2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe composition of CRs is determined if we know not\nonly their all-particle spectrum,\nX\nJ(\u01eb) =\nJA (\u01eb),\n(1)\nA\n\nthat is the differential intensity J(\u01eb) with respect to particle energy \u01eb, but also the spectra JA (\u01eb) of all relevant elements with atomic number A. Since the shockaccelerated CRs come originally from the thermal background plasma, one has to expect that the flux of each\nCR element in/near the source, is proportional to the\nnumber density of this element NA in the background\nplasma: JAs (\u01eb) \u221d NA . Therefore it is useful to represent\nthe spectrum of each CR element in the form\nJAs (\u01eb) = eA (\u01eb)aA JHs (\u01eb),\n(2)\nwhere aA = NA /NH is the abundance of element A relative to the hydrogen abundance and eA (\u01eb) is an en-\n\n\f2\n\nE.G. Berezhko\n\nrichment factor which describes the preferential production of element A relative to the production of protons\n(marked by the subscript H).\nDirect measurements of CR fluxes at energies \u01eb <\n1014 eV show that the factor eA > 1 considerably exceeds unity and that it progressively increases with the\nincrease of A (e.g. Berezhko & Ksenofontov 1999). This\nmeans a considerable enrichment of CRs in heavy elements compared with the interstellar abundance. Note\nthat at these relatively low energies, where direct determination of CR particle parameters is possible, the fluxes\nJA and JH are usually compared at the same energy per\nnucleon, that is for \u01ebA = A\u01ebH . Since it is impossible to\ndetermine the mass of individual CR particles at ultra\nhigh energies, the particle energy instead of the energy\nper nucleon is the most appropriate variable for the analysis of CR spectrum and composition in this case.\nThe observed CR composition at \u01eb < 1017 eV\nis well consistent with the scenario in which Galactic CR component is produced by supernova shocks\n(Berezhko & V\u00f6lk 2007). The enrichment of shockaccelerated CRs by heavy elements is due to a more effective injection and subsequent acceleration of heavy ions\n(see Berezhko & Ksenofontov 1999, for the details).\nThe spectra of ultrahigh energy CRs produced by nonrelativistic cocoon shocks can be represented in the form\n(Berezhko 2008)\nJAs (\u01eb)\n\n= CA \u01eb\n\n\u2212\u03b3\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u2248 2.6 and the values of parameters CA \u221d eA NA\nare determined by the background medium's composition\nNA and by the enrichment factors eA . Since the injection/acceleration of CRs at cocoon and supernova shocks\nare expected to be very similar, the values of the enrichment factors eA in the former case can be extracted from\nthe experimentally measured fluxes of the Galactic CR\ncomponent JA (\u01eb) at some fixed energy, say \u01eb = 1 TeV (see\ne.g. Berezhko & V\u00f6lk 2007), according to the expression\neA = JA (1 TeV)/JH (1 TeV)(NH /NA )\u2299 .\n\n(4)\n\nHere (NA /NH )\u2299 is the solar system relative abundance\nof elements with atomic number A.\nIn order to calculate the spectra of extragalactic CRs\ninside the Galaxy one needs to take into account the\nmodification of the CR spectra due to their interaction\nwith the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and due\nto their modulation in the Galactic wind. This can be\ndone by representing the observed extragalactic CR spectrum in the form\nJA (\u01eb) = Pl Ph JAs (\u01eb),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere factors Pl and Ph describe CR flux modification\ndue to Galactic wind and CMB respectively. Since the\ndiffusive mobility of the CRs is inversely proportional\nto the particle charge number Z, the first factor can be\nrepresented in the form\nPl = exp(\u2212Z\u01ebl /\u01eb),\n17\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u01ebl \u223c 10 eV (Berezhko & V\u00f6lk 2007). This expression shows that at a given energy the lighter CR\nspecies can more easily penetrate the inner Galaxy from\noutside. Due to this factor the observed extragalactic\nCR component becomes progressively heavier with increasing energy.\n\nFig. 1.- Overall CR intensity as a function of energy (thick solid\nline), Galactic CR component produced in SNRs (thick dashed\nline) and extragalactic component produced in the IGM (thick\ndash-dotted line). The spectra of different extragalactic components are shown by thin lines. Experimental data obtained in the\nATIC-2 (Panov et al. 2006), JACEE(Asakimori et al. 2003), KASCADE (Antoni et al. 2005), Akeno (Takeda et al. 2003), and HiRes\n(Bergman et al. 2007) experiments are shown as well.\n\nTo describe the effects of CRs interacting with the\nCMB radiation during their propagation from extragalactic sources to the observer \u2013 pion and pair production, CR nuclei photodesintegration and adiabatic cooling \u2013 we use a simple analytical form of the factor Ph\nPh = exp[\u2212(A\u01eb/\u01ebh )2 ].\n18\n\n(7)\n\nAt \u01ebh = 1.3 \u00d7 10 eV for the case of helium and iron\nnuclei it satisfactorily fits the results of detailed calculations which consistently describes all these effects\n(Berezinsky et al. 2006). In the case of protons, instead\nof the modification factor Ph we directly use their modified spectrum calculated by Berezinsky et al. (2006).\nAs is clear from expression (7), the interaction of CR\nnuclei with the CMB radiation produces a sharp cutoff\nin their spectra at the energy, which is proportional to\nthe nuclear mass. Due to this fact CRs are expected to\nbecome progressively heavier at energies above 1018 eV.\nThe cocoon shock propagates initially through the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy and later\nthrough the intergalactic medium (IGM). The IGM\nis less abundant in heavy elements than the ISM:\nthe median metallicity of the IGM is (NA /NH ) =\n0.2(NA /NH )\u2299 for all relevant elements heavier than helium (e.g. Cen & Ostriker 2006). Since the maximal\nCR energy produced by the expanding cocoon shock\ndecreases with time (Berezhko 2008), the local metallicity at the shock front changes from the ISM value\n(NA /NH ) \u2248 (NA /NH )\u2299 at early phases, when the shock\nproduces CRs up to \u01ebmax \u223c Z \u00d7 1020 eV, to the IGM\nvalue at late phases, when \u01ebmax \u223c Z \u00d7 1018 eV. To\ndescribe this effect we uses a metallicity (NA /NH ) =\n0.2[\u01eb/(Z\u00d71018 eV)]0.35 (NA /NH )\u2299 . For helium we use the\ncosmological value NHe = 0.08NH (e.g. Berezinsky et al.\n2006). Using these number densities one can calculate\nthe relative values of the coefficients CA /CH for all elements except protons. The proton coefficient CH depends on a number of physical factors such as the IGM\nhydrogen number density NH and the power and spatial\ndistribution of nearby AGNs. Its value is determined by\nthe fit of the expected all-particle CR flux J(\u01eb) to the\nexisting measurements of the CR intensity at energies\n\u01eb > 1018 eV.\n\n\fComposition of CRs from AGNs\n\n3\n\nH\nthe shower maximum for protons, Xmax\n, and for iron nuFe\nclei, Xmax\n, from simulations, the mean logarithmic mass\ncan be estimated from the measured Xmax according to\nthe relation (e.g. H\u00f6randel 2005)\n\nFig. 2.- Mean logarithm of the CR nucleus atomic number as a\nfunction of energy. Solid and dashed lines correspond to the dip and\nankle scenarios respectively. Experimental data obtained in the\nATIC-2, JACEE, KASCADE (QGSJET and SYBYLL; H\u00f6randel\n2005), and HiRes (QGSJET and SYBYLL; Abbasi et al. 2005)\nexperiments are shown.\n\nSecondary protons appearing as a result of photodesintegration of helium nuclei are also included in an approximate way: it is assumed that the secondary protons\n(whose total number equals four times the number of\nhelium nuclei in the source spectrum with energy above\n2 \u00d7 1018 eV) have the normal energy distribution around\n\u01eb0 = 5 \u00d7 1017 eV within the interval \u2206\u01eb = \u01eb0 .\nIn Fig.1 we present the all-particle spectrum which\nincludes two components: CRs produced in SNRs\n(Berezhko & V\u00f6lk 2007) and extragalactic CRs, which\nconsist of protons (H), helium (He) and three groups of\nheavier nuclei, produced in AGNs. Note, that the dip at\nenergy \u01eb \u2248 1019 eV is still clearly seen even though it is\nless pronounced compared with the case of pure proton\ncomposition. The calculated overall CR spectrum is in a\nsatisfactory way consistent with the experimental data,\nexcept in the energy interval 1017 < \u01eb < 1018 eV in the\ntransition region, where, contrary to the experiment, the\ncalculated spectrum has a small dip. Taking into account\nthe existing experimental uncertainties at these energies\nit is not clear whether this discrepancy is a serious problem for the model or not. Note, that the size and the\nshape of this peculiarity is very sensitive to the details\nof the galactic CR high energy cutoff and to the extragalactic low energy spectrum part. Therefore it is hard\nto predict it quantitatively. At the same time the overall\nspectrum, which is a mixture of two independent components, should have such peculiarity within the transition\nregion. If the actual CR spectrum is indeed so uniform\nwithin the energy range 1017 < \u01eb < 1018 eV, as it looks\naccording to the Akeno data, then it should be considered as a serious problem for the dip scenario.\nThe mean logarithm of CR atomic number is represented in Fig.2 as a function of energy. As already qualitatively predicted (Berezhko 2008), the CR mass energy\ndependence < ln A(\u01eb) > has two peaks. The first one\nat the energy \u01eb \u2248 1017 eV corresponds to the very end\nof the galactic CR component (Berezhko & V\u00f6lk 2007),\nwhereas the second, at the energy \u01eb \u2248 1019 eV, is at the\nbeginning of the GZK cutoff. Note that at high energies \u01eb > 1015 eV information about CR composition is\nobtained from the mean values of the shower maxima\nXmax (usually measured in g/cm2 ), determined by the\nground based detectors. Knowing the average depth of\n\nH\nFe\nH\n< ln A >= (Xmax \u2212 Xmax\n)/(Xmax\n\u2212 Xmax\n) < ln 56 > .\n(8)\nThis conversion requires the choice of a particle interaction model. Here we use the values of Xmax , measured\nin the HiRes experiment (Abbasi et al. 2005), and the\nQGSJET and SYBYLL models to determine < ln A >.\nIt is seen from Fig.2 that the HiRes data are very well\nconsistent with the expected sharp decrease of < ln A >\nwithin the energy interval 1017 \u22121018 eV. At higher energies, between 1018 and 1019 eV, the experimental values\nof < ln A(\u01eb) > have a quite irregular behavior. Nevertheless, the experiment reveals a trend of progressive\nincrease of the mean CR mass so that the expected peak\nvalue < ln A >\u2248 1.7 at the energy \u01eb \u223c 1019 eV is consistent with the existing HiRes data. It is also clear from\nFig.2, that a more precise experimental determination of\nthe CR mass composition for \u01eb > 1015 eV is required for\na more complete conclusion about the CR origin.\n\n3. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative scenario for the overall CR spectrum\nis the \"ankle scenario\" (Berezinsky et al. 2006). In this\ncase the extragalactic source spectrum, as compared\nwith the dip-scenario, is assumed to be much harder\nJAs \u221d \u01eb\u22122 so that it becomes dominant above an energy of \u01eb = 1019 eV (e.g. Berezinsky et al. 2006). Therefore, to fit the observed overall CR spectrum one needs a\nthird component to fill the gap between the Galactic CR\nspectrum, produced by SNRs, and the hard extragalactic spectrum. It is hard to believe that this third CR\ncomponent could be completely independent of the CR\ncomponent produced in SNRs, since in such a case one\nshould expect some peculiarity in the spectral shape at\nenergy \u01eb \u2248 1017 eV, where these two components are expected to match. The appropriate solution of this problem is the existence of some kind of reacceleration process\nwhich picks up the most energetic CRs from SNRs and\nsubstantially increases their energy, resulting in a smooth\nextension of the first CR component towards the higher\nenergies.\nWe model the spectra of reaccelerated CRs in the following way, without specifying the reacceleration mechanism. For every element with the nuclear charge number\nZ, as in the dip scenario, we use the spectrum, which\ncoincides with JA (\u01eb) for \u01eb < \u01ebZmax1 and has a form\nJA (\u01eb) = JA (\u01ebZmax1 )(\u01eb/\u01ebZmax1 )\u2212\u03b3 exp(\u2212\u01eb/\u01ebZmax2)\n\u01ebZmax1 .\n\n\u01ebZmax1\n\n(9)\n\nat \u01eb >\nHere\nis the minimum energy of particles involved in reacceleration, and \u01ebZmax2 is the maximum\nparticle energy achieved during reacceleration. It is natural to assume that these energies scale proportional to\nthe rigidity \u01ebZmax = Z\u01ebpmax . Here the superscript p denotes protons. The quantities \u01ebpmax1 , \u01ebpmax2 and \u03b3 are\ntreated as free parameters whose values are determined\nas a result of the best fit. CR acceleration by spiral density shocks in the Galactic Wind (V\u00f6lk & Zirakashvili\n2004), or acceleration in the vicinity of pulsars (Bell\n1992; Berezhko 1994) could play the role of the reacceleration mechanism.\n\n\f4\n\nE.G. Berezhko\nmeans that HiRes CR composition is against GRBs as\na source of ultra high energy CRs. In addition, as\nBerezinsky et al. (2006) argued, the energy output of\nGRBs has a serious problem if they are considered as\nthe main source of the extragalactic CRs. Note also,\nthat based on the data collected at the Auger experiment, correlation between the arrival directions of CRs\nwith energy above 6 \u00d7 1019 eV and the position of nearby\nAGNs has been find (Abraham et al. 2007), that strongly\nsupports AGNs as a prime candidate for the source of ultra high energy CRs.\n4. SUMMARY\n\nFig. 3.- The same as in Fig.1, but for the ankle scenario.\nThe dashed line represents the Galactic component, which includes\nCRs produced in SNRs and reaccelerated CRs. The dash-dotted\nline represents the extragalactic component; it corresponds to the\ns \u221d \u01eb\u22122 (Berezinsky et al. 2006).\nsource spectrum JA\n\nWe present in Fig.3 the CR spectrum calculated within\nthe ankle scenario, with the adopted values \u01ebpmax1 =\n5 \u00d7 1015 eV, \u01ebpmax2 = 1.5 \u00d7 1017 eV and \u03b3 = 3, which\nprovide the best fit to the observed CR spectrum. Following Berezinsky et al. (2006) we use the extragalactic\nCR source spectrum in the form JAs \u221d \u01eb\u22122 and assume\nthe composition of these CRs with < A(\u01eb) >= 1.\nIt is seen that at \u01eb > 1017 eV it is well consistent with\nthe data. However, such a well-known peculiarity in CR\nspectrum as the knee at \u01eb \u2248 3 \u00d7 1015 eV is much less\npronounced in the theoretical CR spectrum than in the\nexperiment. This may be considered as an indication\nagainst the ankle scenario.\nAs it is seen in Fig.2, the CR composition corresponding to the ankle scenario is considerably heavier at energies 1017 \u01eb < 1019 eV than in the dip scenario and is\ninconsistent with the HiRes measurements. Note, that\nCR composition of the reaccelerated CRs is a direct consequence of the heavy CR composition at the energy\n\u01eb > \u01ebZmax1 , where the reacceleration is assumed to start,\nand it is not sensitive to the details of reacceleration process.\nSince the expected spectrum of CRs produced in\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has a form J s \u221d \u01eb\u2212\u03b3 with\n\u03b3 = 2 \u2212 2.2 only ankle scenario is possible if GRBs\nare the the source of extragalactic CR component\n(see Berezinsky et al. 2006, and references therein). It\n\nThe composition of ultra high energy CRs produced\nby nonrelativistic cocoon shocks around AGNs is characterised by well pronounced peculiarities which are two\npeaks in the energy dependence of the mean CR atomic\nnumber < A(\u01eb) >. The first peak at the energy \u01eb \u2248\n1017 eV corresponds to the very end of the Galactic CR\ncomponent, produced in SNRs (Berezhko & V\u00f6lk 2007),\nwhereas the second, at the energy \u01eb \u2248 1019 eV, is expected at the beginning of the GZK cutoff. The strong\nenergy dependence of the CR composition within the\nenergy interval from 1017 to 1018 eV is expected as a\nsignature of the transition from heavy Galactic to light\nextragalactic CRs, whereas the detection of a heavy CR\ncomposition at \u01eb \u2248 1019 eV has to be considered as the\nsignature of CR production by the nonrelativistic cocoon\nshocks.\nThe existing measurements of CR composition are consistent with the dip scenario with a formation of the CR\nspectrum in SNRs and AGNs and are inconsistent with\nthe ankle scenario, which includes reacceleration of CR\nproduced in SNRs as a third CR component. Additional\npeculiarity in the overall CR spectrum \u2013 the dip in the\ntransition region 1017 < \u01eb < 1018 eV \u2013 is expected within\nthe dip scenario. Since it is not seen in the existing data\nit is a real difficulty for the dip scenario. It is therefore\nclear that a more precise measurements of CR spectrum\nand composition at energies above 1017 eV are needed\nfor a strict determination of CR origin.\nI thank H.J.
