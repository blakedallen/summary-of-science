INTRODUCTION\n\nNumerical simulations of stellar evolution are generally based upon restrictive assumptions regarding dynamics (e.g., hydrostatic balance and mixing-length convection), because the dynamic timescales are so much\nshorter than the nuclear burning timescale. Neutrino\ncooling accelerates the last burning stages so that direct\ndynamic simulation is feasible (Bazan & Arnett 1998;\nAsida & Arnett 2000), at least for the oxygen burning\nshell. We are extending this work to longer evolutionary\ntimes, larger computational domains, and three dimensional flow (3D). In this letter, we summarize new results with a discussion of the hydrodynamics underlying\nimportant symmetry breaking and compositional mixing\nprocesses which may significantly affect progenitor and\ncore-collapse supernova models. A detailed discussion\nof these results will appear separately; we indicate the\nwider implications here.\n2. A DOUBLE SHELL MODEL: ACTIVE OXYGEN AND\nCARBON BURNING\n\nPreviously we have evolved a 23M\u2299 model with the\none-dimensional TYCHO code to a point where oxygen and carbon are burning in concentric convective\nshells which overlay a silicon-rich core; details may be\nfound in (Young & Arnett 2005). The resultant stellar structure is presented in Figure 1. For subsequent hydrodynamic evolution we use PROMPI, a version of the PROMETHEUS direct Eulerian PPM code\n(Fryxell, M\u00fcller, & Arnett 1989) that has been ported\nto multi-processor computing systems via domain decomposition. Our multi-dimensional calculations use the\nsame physics as the one-dimensional TYCHO code, including nuclear reaction rates, equation of state, and radiative opacities. We use a 25 nucleus reaction network\nin these models, tuned to capture the oxygen and carbon burning energy generation rates to within 1% of the\n1 Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721\nElectronic address: cmeakin@as.arizona.edu, darnett@as.arizona.edu\n\n177 species version used to evolve the 1D model. The 25\nnucleus network contains electrons, neutrons, protons,\n4\nHe, 12 C, 16 O, 20 Ne, 23 Na, 24 Mg, 28 Si, 31 P, 32 S, 34 S,\n35\nCl, 36 Ar, 38 Ar, 39 K, 40 Ca, 42 Ca, 44 Ti, 46 Ti, 48 Cr, 50 Cr,\n52\nFe, 54 Fe, 56 Ni, and all significant strong and weak interaction links. The reaction rates, including 12 C(\u03b1, \u03b3),\nare from Rauscher & Thielemann (2000).\nA two dimensional model has been calculated on a 90\u25e6\nwedge which is embedded in the equatorial plane of a\nspherical coordinate system and has radial limits which\nencompass both the oxygen and carbon burning convective shells. Table 1 lists some additional details of the\nsimulated model. A three dimensional model including\njust the oxygen shell and bounding stable layers is partially evolved at present (300 seconds).\n3. RESULTS\n\nFlow Topology with Two Burning Shells. Following the\nreadjustment of the outer boundary due to small inconsistencies in the initial 1D model, a quasi-steady state\nflow develops, shown in Fig.2. The top half of the figure\nshows the velocity magnitude; the lower shows energy\ngeneration. Velocities are significant even in the nonconvective regions, but have different morphology. The\nconvective regions have round patterns (vortices) with\noccasional plumes, while the nonconvective regions have\nflattened patterns (mostly g-modes). The flow fluctuates\nstrongly. New fuel is ingested from above; the oxygen\nflame shows \"feathery\" features corresponding to such\nfuel-rich matter flashing as it descends. This was previously seen (Bazan & Arnett 1998; Asida & Arnett 2000).\nA new feature appears in the movie version of Fig. 2,\nwhich shows a pronounced, low order distortion of the\ncomoving coordinate, squashing and expanding the apparent circles on which carbon burning proceeds. This\nis due to the coupling of the two shells by waves in the\nnonconvective region between them. This behavior seems\nrobust; we expect it to persist, so that at core collapse\nthis part of the star (at least) will have significant nonspherical distortion.\n\n\f2\n\nFig. 1.- The 23M\u2299 TYCHO model used as initial conditions\nfor the hydrodynamic simulation is shown here. (top) Density and\ntemperature profiles are shown illustrating the large number of\nscale heights simulated as well as the complex entropy structure\ndue to the burning shells. (middle) The mixing length velocities are\nshown and delineate the extents of the carbon and oxygen burning\nconvection zones. The dashed vertical lines mark the boundaries\nof the simulation domain. (bottom) The onion skin compositional\nlayering of the model is shown here for the four most abundant\nspecies.\n\nFig. 2.- The magnitude of the flow velocity (top) and the net\nenergy generation rate, \u01ebnet = \u01ebnuc + \u01eb\u03bd (bottom), is shown for a\nsnapshot of the simulation which includes both an oxygen and carbon burning convection zone. The carbon burning convective shell\nextends to a radius of \u223c4.5\u00d7109 cm while the figure is truncated\nat a radius of \u223c2.9\u00d7109 cm for clarity. A weak silicon-burning\nconvection zone develops at the inner edge of the grid due to a\nsmall boundary-zone entropy error which accumulates during the\ncourse of the calculation.\n\nd ln \u03c1 \u0011\n,\n(1)\n\u2202r s\ndr\nwhere g is the gravity, and the term in parentheses is the\ndifference between the fractional density gradient of the\nstellar structure and the fractional density change due to\na radial (adiabatic) Lagrangian displacement. Regions\nwhere \u03bdB is zero are unstable to convective motions. The\nspikes in \u03bdB in our model are due to steep, stabilizing\ncomposition gradients which separate fuel from ash and\nlead to sharp gradients in density. Convection excites\nwave motions in the adjacent stable layers which give\nrise to the density perturbations. Similar internal wave\nphenomena can be observed in laboratory ice-water convection experiments where the largest temperature fluctuations are measured immediately above the convecting\nlayer where the buoyancy frequency is large (Townsend\n1966), highlighting the generality of this phenomenon.\nResonant Modes. The underlying stellar structure determines the set of discrete resonant modes that can be\nexcited. The narrow stable layers which bound the convective shells in our simulation, including the (truncated)\ncore layer, are isolated enough from other wave propagation regions to act as resonating cavities. These modes\nare the deeper, interior counterparts to the modes observed in helio and asteroseismology studies of milder\nevolutionary stages.\nEach mode can be uniquely identified by its horizontal\nwavenumber index, l, and its oscillation frequency, \u03c9. We\nidentify excited modes in our simulation by isolating spatial and time components of the motion through Fourier\ntransforms. In Figure 4 we present a power spectrum at\neach radius in the simulation for motions with l = 4, the\nlargest horizontal scale that can fit into the 90\u25e6 wedge\nsimulated.

Another asymmetry, nonspherical density perturbations,\nwas found by Bazan & Arnett (1998); Asida & Arnett\n(2000). The fluctuations in density and temperature,\npresented in the top panel of Figure 3 as root mean\nsquare deviations from an angular mean, reach values\nas large as \u223c10% and are localized at the nonconvective\nregion just beyond the convective boundary (top panel).\nThe fluctuations are coincident with regions where the\nbuoyancy frequency, \u03bdB , is large, which can be seen in\n2\nthe bottom panel of Figure 3. Here, \u03bdB\nis a measure\nof the \"stiffness\" of the stratification (Turner 1973), and\nis proportional to the restoring buoyancy force on perturbed stellar matter,\n\n\u0010 \u2202 ln \u03c1\n\n\u2212\n\n\f3\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.1\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\nFig. 3.- (top) Nonspherical density and temperature perturbations (root mean square fluctuation about the angular mean\ndivided by the angular mean) are shown for the inner 1.2\u00d7109 cm\nof the simulation domain. (bottom) In this propagation diagram\n(showing oscillation frequency versus stellar radius) the gravity\nwave and (l=4) acoustic wave propagation zones are indicated by\nthe horizontal and cross-hatched shading, respectively. The gravity wave cavity is bounded above by the buoyancy frequency (solid\nline), while the acoustic cavity is bounded below by the Lamb frequency (dashed line).\n\nfied in the simulation and those calculated from the linearized (non-radial) wave equation of stellar oscillations\n(Unno et al. 1989) is presented in the right hand panel\nfor two modes with significant power. Although the simulation data has additional features, including \"noise\"\nin the convection zones, the mode shapes in both velocity components are strikingly similar between simulation\nand the wave equation; the identification is unambiguous. Gravity waves evanesce (exponentially attenuate)\nbeyond the boundaries of the stable layers but still contain significant power in the convection zones. Acoustic\nwaves are free to propagate in the acoustic cavity which\noverlaps the carbon burning convection zone.\nDuring the late evolutionary epoch simulated here, the\ng-mode and p-mode propagation zones are not widely\nseparated in radius, allowing wave modes of mixed character to couple (Unno et al. 1989). The modes in the\nacoustic cavity are trapped by the boundary conditions\nof the calculation but would otherwise propagate into\nthe stellar envelope where they would deposit their energy through radiative damping, providing an additional\nchannel for energy transport out of the burning region.\nThe good agreement of the numerical modes with the\nanalytic modes indicates that our numerical procedures\ngive an excellent representation of the hydrodynamics\nof waves, even of very low mach number. We note that\nanelastic codes will not reproduce the p-mode and mixed\nmode waves properly, as we have ascertained by direct\nintegration of the anelastic wave equation.\nKinetic Energies and Wave Induced Mixing. During\nthe simulations, convective motions excite waves and\nbuild up significant kinetic energy in nonconvective regions. The integrated kinetic energies are 2.1 \u00d7 1045 ergs\nin the inner nonconvective region, 5.2 \u00d7 1047 ergs in the\noxygen burning convective shell, 9.7 \u00d7 1045 ergs in the in-\n\ntermediate nonconvective region, and 6.9 \u00d7 1046 ergs in\nthe carbon burning shell. The kinetic energy is small in\nthe outer stable region, but is still increasing by the end\nof the simulation.\nIn our simulations, the importance of the excited gmodes in the stable layers lies primarily in the role they\nplay in mediating mixing at the convective boundaries\nand in the stably stratified layers. We identify a cycle in\nwhich kinetic energy builds up in the stable layer until\nthe underlying wave modes reach non-linear amplitudes,\nbreakdown and drive mixing. This process is analogous\nto the physical picture which underlies semiconvective\nmixing (Stevenson 1979; Langer et al. 1983; Spruit 1992)\nbut is driven on a hydrodynamic rather than a thermal timescale. The growth time for the fastest growing\nmodes in our simulation is \u223c200 seconds and leads to\nan average migration speed of outer oxygen shell boundary of \u223c4\u00d7104 cm s\u22121 , entraining mass into the convection zone at a rate of \u223c10\u22124 M\u2299 s\u22121 , significantly\naffecting the evolution. Identifying the spectrum of excited modes in numerical simulations, including amplitudes and waveforms, provides guidance for developing\nand testing a quantitative model of this mixing mechanism. An important parameter controlling the boundary\nentrainment rate is the gradient Richardson number such\nthat steeper density (and composition gradients) will\nlead to lower mixing rates so that sharp gradients are expected to form and persist (Peltier 2003; Alexakis et al.\n2004). In addition to the mixing associated with wavebreaking, enhanced compositional diffusion can be driven\nby the presence of the oscillatory flow setup by g-modes\n(Press & Rybicki 1981; Knobloch & Merryfield 1992). It\nhas been demonstrated that the structure of presupernova iron cores is very sensitive to how mixing is handled at convective boundaries with significant implications for both the explosion mechanism and nucleosynthetic yields (e.g. Woosley & Weaver 1988). If the amplitudes of the wave motions identified in our simulations\nremain robust to the numerical limitations (e.g., resolution, domain size) then neglecting the mixing processes\nassociated with these waves constitutes a large source of\nerror in progenitor models.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nDifferences in 2D and 3D. While these 2D simulations\nallow us to see the interaction of carbon and oxygen\nshells, and show wave generation at convective boundaries, they impose an unphysical symmetry on the problem. Our 3D simulations have only been carried to 300\nseconds of stellar time, but show that the wave generation is a robust result. The flow in the convection zones,\nhowever, are qualitatively different between the 2D and\n3D models: the 2D flow is dominated by vortices which\nspan the convection zone, while the 3D flow is characterized by smaller scale plumes. Quantitatively, the amplitude of the 2D convective motions are larger than the\n3D by a factor of 8, while the 3D motions are larger than\nmixing length values by a factor of 1.5. Two-dimensional\nsimulations of gravitational collapse will be misleading at\nleast to the extent that convective motions are important.\nPresupernova Models. Perhaps the most important\nimpact that internal waves have on stellar structure in\nthe late stages of massive star evolution is the degree to\nwhich they drive compositional mixing. In our simula-\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 4.- (left) The frequency power spectrum of the l=4 component of the radial velocity (vx ) is shown as a function of radius. The\ndashed horizontal lines indicate the frequencies of two waves with significant power that are compared to linear theory in the adjacent\npanel. (right) Two l=4 wave forms are shown. The wave forms extracted from the simulation data (dotted line) and calculated with linear\ntheory (solid line) are shown for comparison. For each mode the horizontal (vy ) and radial velocity (vx ) components are presented in units\nof cm s\u22121 . The shaded areas correspond to stably stratified regions. Both of these modes have some p- and g-mode character. The mode\nin the bottom panel is predominately of g-mode character, while the mode in the top panel is more clearly of mixed type.\n\ntions internal wave modes grow to non-linear amplitudes\nand mix material at convective boundaries on a hydrodynamical timescale. Given the strong dependence of\npresupernova structure on the rate at which mixing occurs at convective boundaries we see the incorporation\nof internal wave physics into stellar evolution codes as a\nneccesary refinement.\nSymmetry Breaking. Spherical symmetry in presupernova models is broken by (1) the density perturbations\ninduced by turbulence within the convection zone, (2)\nthe wave interactions between burning shells, and (3)\nrotationally induced distortions. The perturbations by\nwaves which are trapped between the oxygen and carbon\nburning shells are correlated on large angular scales, as\nis rotation, while the turbulent perturbations have both\na smaller scale and amplitude. Our restricted simulation\ndomain filters out wave modes with l < 4, so it is likely\nthat even larger scale perturbations exist in real stars.\nSymmetry breaking will seed instabilities in an outward\npropagating supernova shock (Kuranz et al. 2005), and\nin the collapsing core. The converging case has been intensely studied for inertial confinement fusion (Lindl, J.\n1998). The diverging case has implications for the problem of 56 Ni and56 Co decay in SN1987A (Herant & Benz\n1991; Kifonidis et al. 2003).\n\nThe conclusion that internal wave modes do not grow\nto large amplitudes during core collapse through nuclear\ndriven overstability (Murphy et al. 2004), is based upon\nan analysis that ignores (1) the dynamics of convective\nmotion and (2) the shell-shell interactions, both of which\nare expected to become more violent as collapse is approached. Asymmetries in core collapse have implications for pulsar birth kicks, explosion mechanisms, and\nfor gravitational wave generation. Talon & Charbonnel\n(2005) have shown that internal gravity waves can transport angular momentum at a rate sufficient to be important in the evolution of solar mass stars; we suggest that\nthey are important for evolution of more massive stars to\ncore collapse, and for plausible prediction of the angular\nmomentum distribution in that collapse.\nThe authors would like to thank Jeremiah Murphy,\nChristian Ott, Patrick Young, Adam Burrows, Ed Olszewski, Luc Dessart and Philip Pinto for useful discussions and comments.
