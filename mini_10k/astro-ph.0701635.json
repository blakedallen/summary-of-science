Within the\ncontext of field theory and particle physics it is appealing to interpret the dark energy as some kind of particles\nthat interact with the particles of the standard model\nvery weakly. The weakness of the interaction is required\nsince dark energy particles have not been produced in the\naccelerator and because the dark energy has not decayed\ninto lighter (e.g. massless) fields such as the photon.\nPerhaps the most appealing candidate for dark energy is\nthat of a scalar field, quintessence [3], which can be either a fundamental particle or a composite particle [4]. It\nwas common to assume the interaction between the dark\nenergy and all other particles to be via gravity only, however recently interacting dark energy models have been\nproposed [5]-[9]. The interesting effect of this interaction\nis two fold. On the one hand, the interaction between\ndark energy and matter, which can be for example dark\nmatter or neutrinos [7], is to give an apparent equation of\nstate of dark energy smaller (more negative) than without the interaction and can be even smaller than -1 [9],\nas suggested by the cosmological observations. On the\nother hand it is also possible to have dark energy interacting with neutrinos and it is tempting to relate both\nenergies since they are of the same order of magnitude\n[7] and a mass of neutrinos larger than 0.8eV imply that\nthe dark energy cannot be a cosmological constant [8].\nIn general fluids with w < \u22121 give many theoretically\nproblems such as stability issues or wrong kinetic terms\nas phantom fields [10]. However, interacting dark energy\nis a very simple and attractive option which we will use\nin this letter.\nSince the dark energy dilutes slower than matter we expect it to dominate the universe at late times. So, once\nthe universe begins to accelerate due to dark energy we\nexpect it to maintain this state of acceleration in the future and the universe will end up completely dominated\nby dark energy. In this letter we would like to study if\nthis fate of the universe is unavoidable or we could have\n\na transition from an accelerating universe to a non accelerating one in which the dark energy decays into another\nfluid. We will show that the fact that the cosmological\ndata [1], specially the SN1a data [2], prefer an equation\nof state w of dark energy smaller than minus one can be\na signal that dark energy will decay in the future and the\nuniverse will stop accelerating. This conclusion is based\nin interpreting a w < \u22121 as a signal of dark energy interaction with another fluid. We determine the interaction\nthrough the cosmological observations and extrapolating\nit into the future.\nThis letter is organized as follows. In section II we\npresent the generic evolution of two interacting fluids.\nIn section III we introduce the effective and apparent\nequations of state and in section IV we give the evidence\na dark energy decay. Finally we present our conclusions.\nII.\n\nINTERACTING DARK ENERGY\nA.\n\nFluid Evolution\n\nThe evolution of two interacting fluids \u03c1\u03c6 and \u03c1b , which\ncan be quintessence scalar field \u03c6 for dark energy \"DE\"\nand another fluid (\u03c1b ), as for example matter or radiation, is given by\n\u03c1\u0307\u03c6 = \u22123H\u03c1\u03c6(1 + w\u03c6 ) \u2212 \u03b4(t)\n\u03c1\u0307b = \u22123H\u03c1b (1 + wb ) + \u03b4(t)\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwith H = \u0227/a the Hubble parameter and \u03b4(t) the interaction coupling. This \u03b4 is a dissipative term, it depends\non the interaction term between the particles of \u03c1\u03c6 and\n\u03c1b and is in general a function of time. The equation\nof state parameters w\u03c6 \u2261 p\u03c6 /\u03c1\u03c6 and wb \u2261 pb /\u03c1b may\nbe functions of time. Without lack of generality we will\ntake wb > w\u03c6 , which is consistent with assuming \u03c1\u03c6 as\nthe dark energy in the absence of an interaction term.\nA simple general solution for \u03c1b can be obtained by\ntaking wb constant and \u03b4 = A(t)\u03c1b . Eq.(2) becomes \u03c1\u0307b =\n\u2212[3H(1 + w\u03c6 ) \u2212 A]\u03c1b and it has a solution\nRt\nRt\ndtA\ndtA\n(3)\n= \u03c1eb e to\n\u03c1b = \u03c1bo a\u22123(1+wb ) e to\n\n\f2\nwith \u03c1eb \u2261 \u03c1bo a\u22123(1+wb ) , the evolution of \u03c1b without an\ninteracting term, i.e. \u03b4 = 0. We take a(to ) \u2261 ao = 1\nat present time. A similar solution can be obtained for\ne \u03c6 the solution to\n\u03c1\u03c6 with w\u03c6 constant and setting \u03b4 = A\u03c1\neq.(1) gives\n\u03c1\u03c6 = \u03c1\u03c6o a\u22123(1+w\u03c6 ) e\n\n\u2212\n\nRt\n\nto\n\ne\ndtA\n\n= \u03c1e\u03c6 e\n\n\u2212\n\nRt\n\nto\n\ne\ndtA\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03c1e\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c1\u03c6o a\u22123(1+w\u03c6 ) the evolution for \u03b4 = 0. Of\ne are related by \u03b4 = A\u03c1\ne \u03c6 = A\u03c1b . Clearly the\ncourse A, A\nsign of A, i.e. \u03b4, determines whether \u03c1\u03c6 and \u03c1b will evolve\nfaster or slower with the interaction term than without\nit. So, for A positive \u03c1b will dilute slower while for A\nnegative it will dilute faster.\nIf we take the ratio y \u2261 \u03c1\u03c6 /\u03c1b = \u03a9\u03c6 /\u03a9b from eqs.(3)\nand (4) we have\ny=\n\n\u03c1\u03c6\n\u2212\n= yo a3(wb \u2212w\u03c6 ) e\n\u03c1b\n\nRt\n\nto\n\ndtA(1+1/y)\n\n(5)\n\nwith yo = \u03c1\u03c6o /\u03c1bo , and taking the derivative of y w.r.t.\ntime we find\n\u1e8f = 3Hy [\u2206w \u2212 \u03a5]\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u2206w \u2261 wb \u2212 w\u03c6 and\n\u03b4\n\u03a5\u2261\n3H\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1\u03c6 + \u03c1b\n\u03c1\u03c6 \u03c1b\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\nA(1 + y)\n.\n3Hy\n\n(7)\n\nThe value for y is constraint to 0 \u2264 y \u2264 \u221e with y = 0 for\n\u03c1\u03c6 = 0 and y = \u221e for \u03c1b = 0. Clearly from eq.(6) we see\nthat the evolution of y depends on the sign of \u2206w \u2212 \u03a5.\n\n1.\n\n3.\n\nFinite solution: \u2206w = \u03a5\n\nA solution to eq.(6) with y constant and \u03c1b 6= 0, \u03c1\u03c6 6= 0\ne\nis only possible if A/H (or A/H)\nis positive and constant\ne + y)/3H = \u2206w must be\nsince \u03a5 = A(1 + y)/3Hy = A(1\nconstant and positive, taking wb \u2212 w\u03c6 > 0 constant. Let\ne\ne \u03c6 =\nus take A/H\n= C > 0 constant, i.e. with \u03b4 = A\u03c1\ne\nCH\u03c1\u03c6 , and from \u1e8f = 0, i.e. \u03a5 = A(1 + y)/3H = \u2206w, we\nget a stable value of y given by\nys =\n\nH\n\u03a9\u03c6\n3(wb \u2212 w\u03c6 )\n=\n\u2212 1.

Furthermore, since A\ne = [3(wb \u2212w\u03c6 )/(1+\nthen we can integrate eq.(4) with Adt\nys )]Hdt = CHdt = Cda/a to give\n\u03c1\u03c6 = \u03c1\u03c6i\n\n\u0012\n\na\nai\n\n\u0013\u22123(1+w\u03c6 )\u2212C\n\n= \u03c1\u03c6i\n\n\u0012\n\na\nai\n\n+ys w\u03c6\n\u0013\u22123(1+ wb1+y\n)\ns\n\n(10)\nwhere we have used that C = 3(wb \u2212 w\u03c6 )/(1 + ys ). Since\nC is positive the solution in eq.(10) dilutes faster than\nthe non interacting solution \u03c1\u03c6 \u221d a\u22123(1+w\u03c6 ) and with an\neffective equation of state wef f = w\u03c6 + C/3 = (wb +\nys w\u03c6 )/(1 + ys ) > w\u03c6 .\nIII.\n\nEFFECTIVE AND APPARENT EQUATION\nOF STATE\n\nWe will now introduce the effective eq. of state wef f\nand the apparent eq. of state wapp .\n\nNon Interaction solution: \u2206w > \u03a5\nA.\n\nIf (wb \u2212 w\u03c6 ) > \u03a5 then \u1e8f is positive and y will increase,\ni.e. \u03c1b will dilute faster than \u03c1\u03c6 , and we will end up with\n\u03c1\u03c6 dominating the universe. In this case the interaction\nterm \u03b4 is subdominant and the evolution of \u03c1\u03c6 and \u03c1b is\nthe usual one, i.e. \u03c1\u03c6 \u221d a\u22123(1+w\u03c6 ) and \u03c1b \u221d a\u22123(1+wb ) .\n\n2.\n\nFor \u03c1b to dominate the universe we need y \u226a 1 at\nlate time and the (interaction) term \u03a5 should dominate\ne is constant and\nover \u2206w.

In this case eq.(5) is\ny = yi\n\na\nai\n\n\u00133(wb \u2212w\u03c6 )\n\ne \u21920\ne\u2212At\n\nat late times for any value of wb \u2212 w\u03c6 .\n\nTo obtain an effective equation of state we simply\nrewrite eqs.(1) and (2) as\n\u03c1\u0307\u03c6 = \u22123H\u03c1\u03c6 (1 + wef f )\n\u03c1\u0307b = \u22123H\u03c1b (1 + wbef f )\n\n(11)\n\nwith the effective equation of state defined by\n\nInteracting solution: \u2206w < \u03a5\n\n\u0012\n\nEffective Equation of State\n\n(8)\n\nwef f = w\u03c6 +\n\n\u03b4\n,\n3H\u03c1\u03c6\n\nwbef f = wb \u2212\n\n\u03b4\n. (12)\n3H\u03c1b\n\nThe solution to eq.(11) is\nRt \u03b4\nRt\ndt\n\u2212\n\u22123\n(1+wef f )da/a\nto\n\u03c1\u03c6 = e\n= a\u22123(1+w\u03c6 ) e to \u03c1\u03c6\nRt\nRt \u03b4\ndt\n\u22123\n(1+wbef f )da/a\nto\n(13)\n\u03c1b = e\n= a\u22123(1+wb ) e to \u03c1b\nwhere we have assumed in the second equality of eqs.(13)\nthat w\u03c6 , wb are constant. We see from eqs.(13) that\n\n\f3\nwef f , wbef f give the complete evolution of \u03c1\u03c6 and \u03c1b .\nFor \u03b4 > 0 we have wef f > w\u03c6 and the fluid \u03c1\u03c6 will dilute faster then without the interaction term (i.e. \u03b4 = 0)\nwhile \u03c1b will dilute slower since wbef f < wb . Which fluid\ndominates at late time will depend on which effective\nequation of state is smaller. The difference in eqs.(12) is\n\u2206wef f \u2261 wbef f \u2212 wef f = \u2206w \u2212 \u03a5\n\n(14)\n\nwith \u03a5 defined in eq.(7) while the sum gives\n\u03a9b wbef f + \u03a9\u03c6 wef f = \u03a9b wb + \u03a9\u03c6 w\u03c6 .\n\n(15)\n\nClearly the relevant quantity to determine the relative\ngrowth is given by \u03a5 and if \u03a5 > \u2206w we have \u2206wef f < 0\nand \u03c1b will dominate the universe at late times while for\n\u03a5 < \u2206w we have \u2206wef f > 0 and \u03c1\u03c6 will prevail. For no\ninteraction \u03b4 = 0 and \u03a5 = 0 giving \u2206wef f = \u2206w > 0\nand \u03c1\u03c6 dominates at late times. If \u03a5 = \u2206w then wbef f =\nwef f and the ratio of both fluids \u03c1b /\u03c1\u03c6 will approach\na constant value, and if the universe is dominated by\n\u03c1\u03c6 + \u03c1b , i.e. \u03a9\u03c6 + \u03a9b = 1, then eq.(15) gives\nw\u03c6 \u2264 wef f = wb \u03a9b + w\u03c6 (1 \u2212 \u03a9b ) \u2264 wb ,\n\n(16)\n\ni.e. the effective equation of state is constraint between\nw\u03c6 and wb . Of course eqs.(14) and (7) are consistent with\nthe analysis of eq.(6).\nB.\n\nApparent Equation of State\n\nAn interesting result of the interaction between dark\nenergy with other particles is to change the apparent\nequation of state of dark energy [5]-[9]. An observer that\nsupposes that DE has no interaction sees a different evolution of DE as an observer that takes into account for\nthe interaction between DE and another fluid. This effect allows to have an apparent equation of state w < \u22121\nfor the \"non-interaction\" DE [9] even though the true\nequation of state of DE is larger than -1.\nLet as take the energy density \u03c1 = \u03c1\u03c6 + \u03c1b = \u03c1DE + \u03c1eb .\nThe energy densities \u03c1\u03c6 , \u03c1b are given by eqs.(1) and (2)\nand these two fluid interact via the \u03b4 term. On the other\nhand the energy densities \u03c1DE and \u03c1eb do not interact\nwith each other by hypothesis and therefore we have \u03c1\u0117b =\n\u22123H(1 + wb ) and \u03c1\u0307DE = \u22123H\u03c1DE (1 + wap ), i.e.\n\u03c1eb = \u03c1bo a\u22123(1+wb )\n\u03c1DE = \u03c1DEo a\u22123(1+wap )\n\n(17)\n\nif wb , wapp are constant. It was pointed out that the\napparent equation of state wapp can take values smaller\nthan -1 and it is given by [9]\nw\u03c6\nwap =\n(18)\n1\u2212x\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\nR\nt\n\u03c1eb \u03c1b\n\u03c1bo a\u22123\ndtA\nx\u2261\u2212\n\u22121 = \u2212\ne to\n\u22121\n\u03c1\u03c6 \u03c1eb\n\u03c1\u03c6\n\n\u03b4(t) wef f , \u2200a wapp (a < ao ) wapp (a > ao )\n\u03b4 > 0 wef f > w\u03c6 wapp < w\u03c6\nwapp > w\u03c6\n\u03b4 < 0 wef f < w\u03c6 wapp > w\u03c6\nwapp < w\u03c6\nTABLE I: We show the different relative sizes of wapp and\nwef f with respect to w\u03c6 as a function of the sign of the interaction term \u03b4(t).\n\nvalid if wb = 0 and we have used eq.(3). We see from\neq.(18) that for \u03c1b < \u03c1eb , i.e. A > 0 (or \u03b4 > 0), we have\nx > 0 and wap < w\u03c6 for t < to which allows to have a\nwap smaller than -1.\nThe result in eq.(18) can be generalized to the interaction between two arbitrary fluids. Taking the time\nderivative of \u03c1 = \u03c1\u03c6 + \u03c1b and using eqs.(1) and (2), for an\narbitrary interacting term \u03b4, we get \u03c1\u0307DE = \u22123H\u03c1DE (1 +\nwap ) with\nwap =\n\nw\u03c6 \u2212 wb x\n1\u2212x\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c1bo a\u22123(1+wb )\n\u03c1\u03c6\n\n(19)\n\nwith\nx\u2261\u2212\n\n\u03c1eb\n\u03c1\u03c6\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1b\n\u22121\n\u03c1eb\n\n=\u2212\n\n\u0012 Rt\n\u0013\ndtA\ne to\n\u22121\n\n(20)\nwhere we have used eq.(3). Of course wap , x in eq.(19)\nreduce for wb = 0 to wap , x as given in eq.(18). For t = to\nwe have x = 0 and if there is no interaction \u03b4 = A = 0 we\nhave \u03c1b = \u03c1eb , x = 0 and wap = w\u03c6 . An apparent equation\nof state wap < w\u03c6 is given for 0 < x\u2206w = x(wb \u2212 w\u03c6 ),\ni.e. x > 0. A positive x needs \u03c1eb < \u03c1b which from eq.(3)\nimplies a positive interaction term \u03b4 = A\u03c1b . We also see\nthat a positive wb gives a more negative wap than for\nwb = 0.\nIt is interesting to note, see table I that the apparent\nequation of state wapp is smaller than w\u03c6 for a positive \u03b4\nwhile the effective equation of state wef f is in this case\nlarger than w\u03c6 . This clearly shows that the apparent\nequation of state is an \"optical\" effect not a true evolution.\nIV.\n\nEVIDENCE FOR DARK ENERGY DECAY\n\nThe SN1a observations prefer an equation of state\nw < \u22121 for dark energy. In principal a w < \u22121 for a\nfluid is troublesome since it has instabilities and causality problems. However, as seen in section III this can\nbe an optical effect due to the interaction between dark\nenergy with other particles as for example dark matter\nor neutrinos.\nHere, we will assume that w < \u22121 due to this interaction and we will show that this can be interpreted as\na signal for a dark energy decay in the future with the\nuniverse no longer accelerating.\nThe complete evolution of dark energy is given by the\neffective equation of state wef f given by eq.(12) while the\n\n\f4\n\n(21)\n\nwith \u03b2 a constant to be determined by observations and\n\u03b4a \u2261 a\u2212ao. A positive x in the past (i.e. a < ao ) requires\n\u03b2 > 0. Eq.(21) satisfies the requirements x(ao ) = 0 and\nwe have for wapp > w\u03c6 , x < 0 for a > ao .\nThe SN1a data are in the range 1 > a > 2/5, i.e. for\na redshift 0 < z < 1.5, and the best fit solution has an\naverage equation of state < w >\u2248 \u22121.1 [1]. Taking the\naverage of wapp = w\u03c6 /(1 \u2212 x) we have\nR ao\nwapp da\nw\u03c6 Log [1 \u2212 \u03b2(1 \u2212 a1 )]\n< wapp >\u2261 a1R ao\n=\n(22)\n\u03b2(a1 \u2212 1)\nda\na\n1\n\nwhere we have used eq.(21) and ao = 1. As an example\nlet as take < wapp >= \u22121.1, as suggested by the observations [2],[8], and w\u03c6 = \u22120.9, wb = 0, a1 = 2/5. In\nthis case we obtained from eq.(22) the value \u03b2 = 0.56.\nIf instead of taking the average as in eq.(22) we simple\ntake the wapp evaluated at the extreme points we have\n< wapp >= 21 (wapp (ao ) + wapp (a1 )) giving the simple\n2<wapp >\u22122w\u03c6\nanalytic expression \u03b2 = (1\u2212a1 )(2<w\nand for our\napp >\u2212w\u03c6 )\nprevious example we find \u03b2 = 0.51. The difference in\ndetermining \u03b2 is small and the expression for \u03b2 becomes\nanalytic as a function of < wapp >.\nNow, we would like to determine the effective (true)\neq. of state for dark energy. From eq.(18) we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\nRt\n\u03c1b\n\u03c1b\n\u2212\ndtA\nto\n\u2243 \u2212 A\u03b4t\n1\u2212e\nx=\u2212\n(23)\n\u03c1\u03c6\n\u03c1\u03c6\nRt\ndtA\nwhere we have approximated e to\n\u2243 1 \u2212 A\u03b4t and \u03b4t \u2261\nt \u2212 to . Taking \u03b4 = A\u03c1b and eq.(23) we have \u03b4 = \u2212x\u03c1\u03c6 /\u03b4t\nand using \u03b4t = \u03b4a/aH and eq.(21) we get an interaction\nterm\n\u03b4 = a\u03b2H\u03c1\u03c6 .\n\n(24)\n\nEq.(12) becomes then\nwef f = w\u03c6 +\n\n\u03b4\na\u03b2\n\u2243 w\u03c6 +\n3H\u03c1\u03c6\n3\n\na\u03b2 \u03a9\u03c6\n\u03b4\n\u2243 wb \u2212\n.\n3H\u03c1b\n3 \u03a9b\n\n(26)\n\nUsing eq.(4) or equivalently eq.(13) with the interaction\nterm given in eq.(24) we get an energy density\n\u03c1\u03c6 = a\u22123(1+w\u03c6 ) e\u2212\u03b2(a\u22121)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n7.5\n\n10\n\n12.5\n\n15\n\na\n\nFIG. 1: We show the energy densities \u03a9\u03c6 , \u03a9b (red (dotted)\nand blue (solid) respectively) as a function of the scale factor\na. The b-fluid dominates at late time.

Furthermore wef f = 0 at\na = \u22123w\u03c6 /\u03b2 = 4.8, i.e. due to the interaction wef f grows\nfrom wef f = \u22120.9 to wef f = 0. In this case the universe\ngoes from a decelerating to an accelerating epoch and\nback to a decelerating one at a scale factor ad = 5.1.\nFrom eq.(26) with wb = 0 we have wbef f \u2264 0. Since\nwbef f < wef f for \u03a9\u03c6 6= 0 and a > a\u2217 then we will have\nat late times \u03a9\u03c6 \u2192 0 and wbef f \u2192 0 with a universe\ncompletely dominated by the fluid \u03c1b , matter in this case,\nand decelerating.\nWe show in fig.1 the evolution of \u03a9\u03c6 , \u03a9b in the example\nwith an interaction term \u03b4 = \u2212x\u03c1\u03c6 /\u03b4t = \u2212a\u03b2H\u03c1\u03c6 with\nx given by eq.(21) and w\u03c6 = \u22120.9 and \u03b2 = 0.56, such\nthat the average < wapp >= \u22121.1. Notice that for a < 1\nthe dark energy grows relative to the b-fluid while for\na > 1 (i.e. in the future) the b-fluid dominates. In fig.2\nwe show the effective equations of state given by eqs.(25)\nand (26) and both are larger than -1 at all times. In fig.3\nwe show the apparent eq. of state (c.f. eq.(18)) where\nwapp is smaller than w\u03c6 for a < 1 as suggested by the\nSN1a data but it becomes larger than w\u03c6 for a > 1.\n\nWb ,\n\nobserved equation of state, if we assume no interaction,\nis given by eq.(18), i.e. wapp = w\u03c6 /(1 \u2212 x).\nFor values of the scale factor a close to present day\nao = 1 we propose to approximate x linearly by\n\n(27)\n\nwhich shows that \u03c1\u03c6 dilutes as a\u22123(1+w\u03c6 ) for a \u226a ao = 1\nand \u03c1\u03c6 is exponentially suppressed for a \u226b 1. From\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe cosmological observations prefer an equation of\nstate w < \u22121 for dark energy. We obtain an apparent equation of state for dark energy smaller than minus one due to the interaction between dark energy and\nanother fluid (b-fluid). Form the observational data we\ndetermine the interaction term, close to present day,\nand we show that this interaction imply that dark energy will dilute faster than the b-fluid. The interaction term is \u03b4 = a\u03b2H\u03c1\u03c6 which gives an energy density\n\n\f5\n\u03c1\u03c6 = a\u22123(1+w\u03c6 ) e\u2212\u03b2(a\u22121) , it has an exponential suppression for a \u226b ao . The resulting universe is a decelerating\nuniverse dominated by the b-fluid, which could be dark\nmatter.\n\nwb eff\n\n0\n-0.2\n\nweff ,\n\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\na\n\nFIG. 2: We show the effective eqs. of state wef f , wbef f (red\n(dotted) and blue (solid) respectively) as a function of the\nscale factor a.
