Introduction\nOne of the most important factors determining properties of the transition metal (TM)\noxides is the splitting of d-levels when the TM ions are put in a crystal. This crystalfield (CF) splitting largely determines magnetic and orbital state of respective ions, and\nthus their properties. In general there are two mechanisms, which have to be taken into\naccount in the calculation of the CF splitting.\nOne is the Coulomb interaction of d-electrons with charges of surrounding ions\n- mainly nearest-neighbor anions like O2\u2212 in oxides or F\u2212 and Cl\u2212 in fluorides and\nchlorides. Since the Coulomb repulsion with anions depends on the shape of the electron\ndensity, the resulting corrections to the energy spectrum will be different for different\nd\u2212orbitals.\nThe second mechanism which also leads to the CF splitting is the covalency,\nthe hybridization between d\u2212states of the TM ions and ligand p\u2212states. The p \u2212 d\nhybridization (hopping integrals tpd in Eq. (1)) strongly depends on the symmetry of\nthe local environment and will be very different for d\u2212orbitals pointing to the ligands\n(eg orbitals in the case of a octahedral surrounding) or looking in between of them (t2g\norbitals in the octahedra), which would lead to their splitting. Here and below we will\ndiscuss the octahedral symmetry.\nWe show below that the role of these two mechanisms may strongly differ in\nconventional TM compounds and in the materials with the negative charge-transfer\n(CT) gaps [1, 2], with a (e.g. oxygen) holes in the ground state.\n2. The basic model\nThe standard model describing transition metal (TM) ions in a crystal is\nH = \u01ebd0\n+\n\nX\nj\n\n+\n\nX\n\nd\u2020i\u03b1\u03c3 di\u03b1\u03c3 + \u01ebp\n\ni\u03b1\n\np\u2020j\u03b2\u03c3 pj\u03b2\u03c3\n\nj\u03b2\n\n\u2020\ntpd\nij\u03b1\u03b2 (d\u03b1\u03c3 pj\u03b2\u03c3\n\nX\n\nX\n\n+ h.c.)\n\ndd\nU\u03b1\u03b2\nni\u03b1\u03c3 ni\u03b2\u03c3\u2032 .\n\n(1)\n\n(\u03b1\u03c3)6=(\u03b2\u03c3\u2032 )\n\nHere di\u2020\ni\u03b1\u03c3 , di\u03b1\u03c3 are the creation and annihilation operators of d\u2212electrons at a site\ni in the orbital state \u03b1 with spin \u03c3, p\u2020j\u03b2\u03c3 , pj\u03b2\u03c3 describe different p\u2212electrons at the\nj\u2212th ligand surrounding given TM site. The system is also characterized by the onsite Coulomb (Hubbard) interaction U dd = U, and by the charge-transfer energy \u2206CT ,\ndefined as the energy of the transition\ndn p6 \u2192 dn+1 p5 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich in the electron representation used in the Hamiltonian (1) is\n\u2206CT = \u01ebd0 + nU \u2212 \u01ebp = \u01ebd \u2212 \u01ebp .\n\n(3)\n\n\fCrystal field splitting in correlated systems with the negative charge transfer gap\n\n3\n\nHere we introduced the renormalized energy of d\u2212levels\n\u01ebd = \u01ebd0 + nU\n\n(4)\n\n- the effective d\u2212energy levels to which an electron is transferred from p\u2212states of a\nligand in the \"reaction\" (2). [3] Further on in this paper by d\u2212levels shown e.g. in\nFigs. 1 and 3 we have in mind these renormalized d\u2212levels (4).\nIn principle one should include in this Hamiltonian some other terms, such as the\nintra-atomic Hund's rule exchange JH , Coulomb repulsion for ligand p\u2212electrons Upp ,\netc. For our purposes, however, the simplified model (1) is sufficient.\n3. Positive charge-transfer energy, \u2206CT > 0\nIn a most typical situation for the TM compounds, when the ligand p\u2212levels lie deep\nbelow d\u2212levels of the TM ions, both the Coulomb and the hybridization contributions\nto the CF splitting lead to the same sequence of d\u2212levels. This case is characterized by\na large positive CT gap \u2206CT , defined in Eq. (3). As explained above and as is clearly\nseen in Fig. 1(a), the Coulomb repulsion of d-electrons with negatively-charged ligands\nis stronger for eg \u2212electrons with the lobes of the electron density directed towards\nthe ligands than for t2g \u2212orbitals pointing in between the anions. This leads to the CF\nsplitting shown in Fig. 1(c) such that eg \u2212orbitals lie above t2g . This sequence of d\u2212levels\nis referred as \"normal\".\nThe same \"normal\" sequence of d\u2212levels is also caused by the p \u2212 d hybridization,\ni.e. by covalent contribution. Since the hopping matrix elements eg \u2212 p (tpd\u03c3 ) are larger\nthan hoppings between t2g \u2212orbitals and p\u2212orbitals of ligands (tpd\u03c0 ), the eg \u2212levels are\npushed up stronger than t2g , see Figs. 1(b), (c). [4]\nRelative importance of these two contributions to the total value of the CF splitting\ndepends on the compound, but in the usual situation of \u2206CT > 0 they at least work in\nthe same direction.\nIn the early stage of the development of the CF theory it was argued that an\naccount of the real shape of ligand orbitals may change the sign of the Coulomb\ncontribution, obtained in the point-charge model. [5] However, it was shown later that\nin order to consider ionic term in a correct way the d\u2212electron wave functions must be\northogonalized to the ligands. [6] As a result, the total ionic contribution to the CF\nsplitting has the same sign as the covalent term in the case of \u2206CT > 0. [7]\nNote that for the bonding levels (the lower levels in Fig. 1(c)) the covalency\ncontribution gives the sequence of levels opposite to the \"normal\": the levels with the\neg \u2212symmetry have stronger bonding-antibonding splitting and lie below those with the\nt2g \u2212symmetry. But for large positive CT gap these states are predominantly made of the\ncombination of p\u2212states of ligands with a proper symmetry, with only a small admixture\nof d\u2212states, and one rarely discuss these states, which lie deep below the Fermi energy.\nAll interesting phenomena take place in the partially-filled antibonding states, which\nhave predominantly d\u2212character and which are responsible e.g. for magnetism, orbital\n\n\fCrystal field splitting in correlated systems with the negative charge transfer gap\n\n4\n\nFigure 1. (color online) Charge-transfer gap \u2206CT > 0. There are two contributions\nto the resulting CF splitting caused by (a) the Coulomb interaction and (b) the p \u2212 d\nhybridization (or covalency). The eg \u2212orbitals (the x2 \u2212 y 2 is shown as an example)\npointing to the ligands have larger hybridization and stronger repulsion from them\nand as a result lie above the t2g \u2212levels (the yx\u2212orbital is sketched) . The ligands\nforming octahedra are shown as open circles, d\u2212orbitals are painted in blue and ligand\np\u2212orbitals in green. For the Coulomb contribution the charges (not the signs of the\nwave-functions) are indicated. The levels with predominantly d\u2212character are marked\nby the dashed \"box\".\n\nordering etc. But this changes drastically in case of the negative CT gap \u2206CT < 0,\nwhich we now consider.\n4. Negative charge-transfer energy, \u2206CT < 0\nThe situation is quite different for the systems with small and especially negative CT\ngaps. In this case the Coulomb and covalent contributions to the splitting of d\u2212levels\nhave different signs. The negative CT gap is met in the compounds based on the late\nTM ions with unusually high valence, or high oxidation state [2], like Fe4+ or Cu3+ , see\nFig. 2, compiled by Mizokawa on the basis of the data of [8, 9].\nThe negative CT energy means that it is favorable to transfer an electron from the\nligand p-shell to a d-level, i.e. to perform the \"reaction\" (2) already in the ground state.\nSuch a process is sometimes called self-doping. [11, 10] On the language of energy levels\na regime with the negative CT energy corresponds to the situation when the initial\nrenormalized d\u2212levels \u01ebd in (4) lie below the ligand p\u2212levels.\nWe start with an analysis of the covalent contribution to the CF splitting, Fig. 3(c).\nIn contrast to the case of \u2206CT > 0 it is now the lower bonding orbitals that have\npredominantly d\u2212character with a small admixture of p\u2212states\n\u03a8B = \u03b1|di + \u03b2|pi,\n\n\u03b12 + \u03b2 2 = 1,\n\n\u03b1 \u226b \u03b2.\n\n(5)\n\nFor these bonding states the covalency leads to the splitting such that the t2g \u2212levels\nlie above eg \u2212ones, i.e. this covalency contribution leads to an \"inverted\" CF splitting\nfor d\u2212electrons.\n\n\fCrystal field splitting in correlated systems with the negative charge transfer gap\n10\n\n\u2206(2+)\n\n8\nEnergy (eV)\n\n5\n\nU\n\u2206(3+)\n\n6\n4\n\n\u2206(4+)\n2\n0\nTi\n\nV\n\nCr\n\nMn\n\nFe\n\nCo\n\nNi\n\nCu\n\nFigure 2.

Ligands\nforming octahedra are shown as open circles, d\u2212orbitals are painted in blue and ligand\np\u2212orbitals in green. For the Coulomb contribution the charges (not the signs of the\nwave-functions) are indicated. The levels with predominantly d\u2212character are marked\nby the dashed \"box\".\n\nThese bonding states are actually completely filled. The electrons of partiallyfilled levels will actually be in the antibonding orbitals t\u22172g , e\u2217g . Due to a stronger pd\u03c3\nhybridization of orbitals having eg \u2212symmetry with the ligand p\u2212shell, the bondingantibonding splitting of eg \u2212orbitals is larger than that of t2g \u2212orbitals. As a result\nthe order of antibonding levels is \"normal\", the same as in Fig. 1 (t\u22172g \u2212levels are below\nethe\u2217\n\u2212subshell). But, in contrast to the case of a positive CT gap, here the wave function\ng\nof the antibonding states will be\n\u03a8AB = \u03b1\u2217 |di + \u03b2 \u2217 |pi,\n\n(\u03b1\u2217 )2 + (\u03b2 \u2217 )2 = 1,\n\n\u03b1\u2217 \u226a \u03b2 \u2217 ,\n\n(6)\n\ni.e. these states have predominantly p\u2212character. In effect the resulting state would be\nthe state with the self-doping described above, i.e. with a large fraction of oxygen holes.\n\n\fCrystal field splitting in correlated systems with the negative charge transfer gap\n\n6\n\nThe Coulomb contribution, however, would lead to the opposite sequence of\nd\u2212levels, compared to the covalent term. For the d\u2212levels themselves it would have\nthe same sign as for the case of \u2206CT > 0, and due to a stronger repulsion from ligands\nthe eg \u2212levels (bonding) would be pushed above t2g , opposite to the influence of the\nhybridization.\nOne has to somewhat specify these arguments. In the case of \u2206CT < 0 the ground\nstate should be better taken not as dn p6 , but rather as dn+1 p5 , according to (2). This\nwill change the magnitude of the Coulomb terms, the ting effect: still eg \u2212electrons\nwould repel stronger from the ligands (with smaller charge, e.g. O1.5\u2212 instead of O2\u2212 ).\nThus in the case of the negative CT gap the contributions of the Coulomb interaction\nand of the p \u2212 d covalency to the CF splitting of d\u2212states is opposite.\nThe same can be said about the antibonding levels. As follows from Eq. (6),\nthe antibonding levels have predominantly p\u2212character, but the combinations of\nligand p\u2212electrons with eg -symmetry shown in Fig. 3(a), (e.g. the \u03c3 combination\np\u03c3 = \u221a14 [p1x \u2212 p2y \u2212 p3x + p4y ], which hybridizes with dx2 \u2212y2 -orbital) would have\nstronger attraction to a positively-charged d\u2212ion than the t\u22172g \u2212orbitals, made out of\nthe \u03c0\u2212combination of ligand orbitals. As a result the antibonding t\u22172g \u2212levels due to this\nfactor would lie higher than e\u2217g (Fig. 3(b)).\nThus we see that, in contrast to the \"normal\" case of positive CT gap, where both\ncontributions to the CF splitting, the Coulomb contribution and the covalency, lead\nto qualitatively the same order of levels (antibonding eg -levels are above t2g , and vice\nversa for bonding states), for negative CT gaps the situation is different: these two\ncontributions lead to the opposite level order. Therefore by studying the actual order of\nthese levels, experimentally or theoretically, one can get some information about which\nof these contributions is in fact stronger. We undertook such a study on the example of\na system with the negative CT gap - Cs2 Au2 Cl6 .\n5. Crystal field in Cs2 Au2 Cl6\nCs2 Au2 Cl6 should formally contain the Au2+ (d9 ) ions. However, it is well-known in\nchemistry that this valence state of gold is unstable and is practically never observed\nexperimentally: Au is known to exist in a valence Au1+ or Au3+ . This also happens\nin this material: there occurs a spontaneous charge disproportionation (CD) into Au1+\n(Au2) and Au3+ (Au1), so that there appears in this compound two inequivalent Au\npositions, with checkerboard ordering in a cubic perovskite lattice. [12, 13] , see Fig. 4.\nIn effect even the formula of this material is usually written not as CsAuCl3 , as for usual\nperovskites, but as Cs2 Au2 Cl6 = Cs2 Au1+ Au3+ Cl6 .\nWe carried out the ab-initio band structure calculations of this material, have shown\nthat it has negative CT gap, and analyzed the CF splitting.\nThe ab-initio band-structure calculations of Cs2 Au2 Cl6 were performed within the\nframeworks of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the Generalized Gradient\nApproximation (GGA). We used the PW-SCF code with the ultrasoft version of\n\n\fCrystal field splitting in correlated systems with the negative charge transfer gap\n\n7\n\nFigure 4.

Partial density of states for Cs2 Au2 Cl6 at ambient pressure. Au1 represent\natom, which should have oxidation state 3+, while Au2 - 1+ (according to valence\nbond sum analysis of the crystal structure). The Cl\u2212p partial density of states is the\nnormalized per one Cl for two classes of \"apical\" Cl1 and \"plane\" Cl2 in the octahedra.\nThe Fermi level is taken as zero.\n\nThe partial densities of states (PDOS) are presented in Fig. 5. One may clearly see\n\n\fCrystal field splitting in correlated systems with the negative charge transfer gap\n\n8\n\nFigure 6. The charge-density corresponding to the antibonding orbital of x2 \u2212\ny 2 \u2212symmetry centered on Au1 site, nominally Au3+ . The central part corresponds to\nthe contribution of the real Au\u22125d x2 \u2212 y 2 orbital, while the rest is a \u03c3 combination\nof the Cl\u2212p orbitals.\n\nthat indeed the lowest states in the valence band have largest contributions from the\nAu \u2212 d, not Cl \u2212 p states, so that the CT energy is indeed negative in this compound.\nThe states closest to the top of the valence band, as well as the states in the conduction\nband, are mainly of p-character.\nThe total occupation of Au2 5d\u2212shell is 9.6, which is close to the d10 configuration,\nexpected for Au1+ . However the number of d-electrons for Au1 is 9.3, much larger than\n8 electrons expected from the naive ionic picture for the 3+ oxidation state of Au. Thus\none should represent this states not as Au3+ (d8 ), but rather as d9 L or even d10 L2 , where\nL denotes ligand hole. This is due to the self-doping effect described above. Au3+ ions\nturned out to be Jahn-Teller active, but non-magnetic, with the configuration t62g e1g\u2191 e1g\u2193\n(or rather d10 L \u2191 L \u2193).\nAs it was shown in previous two sections, a larger hybridization leads to a larger\nbonding-antibonding splitting, independent on the sign of the \u2206CT . The Cl octahedron\nsurrounding Au1 is elongated along z\u2212axis. Then the bonding-antibonding splitting for\nthe orbital of x2 \u2212 y 2 -symmetry should be the largest among all of Au 5d\u2212orbitals. This\nis exactly what we see in the upper panel of Fig. 5. The Coulomb contribution to the\ncrystal-field splitting would stabilize just the opposite sequence of levels, see Fig. 3(b).\nThis means that at least in this system the Coulomb contribution to the total value of\nthe CF splitting is much less than the covalent term.\nIt is important to mention that the conduction band is basically formed by the \u03c3\ncombination of Cl\u2212p states with x2 \u2212 y 2 symmetry. These are actually the antibonding\ne\u2217g orbitals of the type (6), shown in Fig. 3(a). The charge density for this orbital,\nobtained using the Wannier function projection technique, is shown in Fig. 6. The\ndetailed calculations show that about \u223c20 % of the charge-density corresponding to\nthis orbital has a 5d\u2212character, while the main part \u223c 80 % comes from the Cl\u2212p\norbitals.\nA similar analysis can be performed for the compressed along the z-axis Au2O6\n\n\fCrystal field splitting in correlated systems with the negative charge transfer gap\n\n9\n\noctahedra. Here again the covalent contribution dominates and pushes down the\nbonding orbital of 3z 2 \u2212 r 2 -symmetry, which has the largest hybridization with the\nCl\u2212p states.\nThe question which naturally arises is how general is the conclusion reached above,\nthat the covalency contribution to the CF splitting is (much) larger than the Coulomb\ncontribution. Generally speaking, one could think that the covalency contribution to\nthe t2g \u2212 eg splitting, which is\nt2pd\u03c3 \u2212 t2pd\u03c0\n,\n(7)\n\u223c\n\u2206CT\ncould become small for very large |\u2206CT |. It is not surprising that this contribution\ndominates for systems with small or slightly negative CT gap (apparently Cs2 Au2 Cl6\nbelongs to this class). Different approaches [7, 18], however, demonstrate that it is\nalso the case for the values of parameters typical for \"normal\" TM compounds, such as\nKNiF3 [7] or NiO. [18] Nevertheless, one can not exclude that in some cases (e.g. for the\nearly 3d metals) the situation could be different and the Coulomb contribution would\nbecome comparable or larger than the covalency one.\n\u2206cov.\nCF\n\n6. Summary\nIn this paper we analyzed possible features of the crystal field splitting in different\nsituations, and argued that for the negative charge-transfer gaps, in contrast to the\n\"normal\" situation with \u2206CT > 0, different contributions to the crystal field splitting,\nthe Coulomb contribution and that of the covalency with the ligands, act in opposite\ndirection: the Coulomb contribution always pushes the t2g levels below the eg ones,\nwhereas the p \u2212 d hybridization would lead to the opposite order of the bonding levels\n(which for negative charge transfer gap have predominantly d\u2212character). The study\nof a concrete example of Cs2 Au2 Cl6 demonstrates that this system indeed has negative\ncharge-transfer gap, so that the states in the conduction band are largely made of\np\u2212states of Cl. The bonding states of d\u2212character lie \u223c2-6 eV below the Fermi energy,\nand in this region the eg levels lie below t2g ones. Thus in this particular system the\np \u2212 d hybridization dominates and determines the sequence of levels. We discuss in\nconclusion whether the opposite situation could be possible, in which case the sequence\nof d\u2212levels would be determined by the Coulomb contribution and might be different\nfrom the usual one.\n7.
