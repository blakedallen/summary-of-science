We find there are at least two different steady states for transport across\nnoncollinear magnetic multilayers. In the conventional one there is a discontinuity in\nthe spin current across the interfaces which has been identified as the source of current\ninduced magnetic reversal; in the one advocated herein the spin torque arises from\nthe spin accumulation transverse to the magnetization of a magnetic layer. These two\nstates have quite different attributes which should be discerned by current experiments.\n\n\fDifferent steady states for spin currents in noncollinear multilayers\n\n2\n\nRecent interest has focused on electron transport across metallic multilayers which\ncontain the 3d transition metals, especially the spin torque acting on a magnetic layer as\ncurrent is driven across noncollinear magnetic multilayers.[1] To calculate the transport\nproperties of multilayered structures one would ideally calculate the wavefunctions for\nthe entire structure and then evaluate the conductivity in the presence of impurities; [2]\nin this approach one retains the long range nature of the conductivity, which is important\neven for diffusive metals.[3] However what is usually done is to adopt a layer-by-layer\napproach in which one solves for the transport within homogeneous layers and connects\nthe out of equilibrium distribution functions with transmission and reflection coefficients\nat the interfaces. These functions are statistical density matrices and contain less\ninformation than wavefunctions, therefore one should anticipate some loss of information\nthat may alter the conductivity one calculates for the entire layered structure. Indeed\nthis has been found when discussing giant magnetoresistance, and it was shown that\nit necessary to include either spin dependent electrochemical potentials or equivalently\nspin accumulation in the layer-by-layer approach which one would not explicitly do if\none determined the wavefunctions for the entire approach.[4] Most of the analyses of\ntransport in multilayers has been done on collinear structures and as far as one can\ntell the use of spin dependent electric fields or accumulation has been able to make\nup for the putative shortcomings of the layer-by layer approach for the conductivity of\nthe whole structure. However when one studies noncollinear magnetic multilayers the\nprevious constructs used to shore up the layer-by-layer approach may well be insufficient\nand, unless augmented by additional artifices, can lead to erroneous predictions, e.g., as\nto the microscopic origin of spin torque. Here we present the case for adding such a new\nconstruct: current induced contributions to the transmission coefficients which connect\nthe out of equilibrium distribution functions between layers.\nWhen current is driven across a magnetically multilayered structure the first\nresponse of the itinerant carriers is a rapid accumulation of charge around the interfaces\nto establish a steady state charge current, i.e., one that does not vary with time; in\nmetallic structures this accumulation is confined to a screening length of the order of\nangstr\u00f6ms. The difference in the density of states at the Fermi level and scattering rates\nfor spin up/down electrons leads to a current which is spin polarized, i.e., j\u2191 \u2212 j\u2193 6= 0\nin the magnetic layers, while the current in the normal layers is not polarized. This\ndiscontinuity in the polarized current at interfaces between ferromagnetic and normal\nmetal layers (N/F) is the source of spin accumulation about the interface; its length\n\u22121\nscale, known as the spin diffusion length, is controlled by the rate of spin flip \u03c4sf\nin\nthe layers; it is only after one has established this spin accumulation that the spin\npolarized current from one magnetic layer can be transmitted to another provided that\nthe normal (non magnetic) spacer layer is less than the spin diffusion length.[5] It is\nalso true that one achieves a steady state spin current after t & \u03c4sf which is of the\norder of a picosecond, say in Cu; conversely if one does not consider the source term\nat interfaces there is no accumulation and no steady state in the thermodynamic sense,\ni.e., one cannot achieve a state of maximum entropy production.[6]\n\n\fDifferent steady states for spin currents in noncollinear multilayers\n\n3\n\nFor collinear structures when the spin accumulation created at one N/F interface\narrives at the other interface of the normal layer it is superimposed on the polarization\nthat exists in equilibrium; while it alters the interface scattering potential at the second\ninterface it does not contribute in linear response, rather it is a nonlinear effect. It is\nfor this reason that one uses the transmission coefficients found from equilibrium band\nstructure calculations. However for noncollinear structures the spin polarization that\nis superimposed has a component that is transverse to the polarization of the second\ninterface. This does not lead to a current driven repopulation of equilibrium states\n,i.e., additional (nonlinear) accumulation, but to a \"current induced spin flip\" between\nstates of opposite spin; this has been recently shown to lead to a new contribution\nto the transmission coefficient that enters in linear response.[7] We have found that\nthis additional term makes the difference in the predictions based on models which\nuse realistic band structures for the individual layers and equilibrium transmission\ncoefficients to connect the nonequilibrium distribution functions across interfaces,[8]\nand those which use free electron bands which maintain spin coherence across the layers\nand mimic the scattering at interfaces by phenomenological interface resistances,[9] i.e.,\nwhen one includes the additional interface scattering in the former models one retrieves\nthe features found in the latter.\nThe rationale behind the conventional treatment of current induced spin\ntorque is the following. The transmission of the spin current across the normal\nmetal/ferromagnetic (N/F) interfaces is described by spin dependent reflection and\ntransmission scattering amplitudes, and the Stoner model of spin split bands for the\nmagnetic layers has provided a good description of electron transport in collinear\nmagnetic multilayers and provides an explanation for one of the origins of giant\nmagnetoresistance, spin dependent interface scattering due to differences in band\nstructure at the N/F interfaces; the model does not involve spin flips and indeed provides\na basis for understanding why spin-flips, which are high energy excitations, are rare (\nimpurity induced). This same model has been applied to noncollinear structures in\nwhich the angle between the magnetic layers is different from 00 and 1800. One again\nwith no spin flip scattering at the interfaces and by using the same parameters for the\nspin dependent interface scattering one finds the spin currents that were continuous in\nthe collinear case now have discontinuities at the interfaces.[8] Indeed in this description\nthese discontinuities represent the transfer of spin angular momentum from the current\nto the magnetic layer and thereby create a \"spin torque\" which eventually leads to\ncurrent induced magnetization reversal.[1] The origin of the discontinuity in the spin\ncurrent can be traced back to the transmission and reflection coefficients at N/F\ninterfaces. In this view the spin angular momentum lost by the spin current goes to the\nbackground magnetization which implies that a steady state for the spin current is not\nachieved before the background moves in such a manner as to remove the discontinuity\nin the spin current, which is of the order of a nanosecond.\nAn alternate view has been proposed in which a steady state spin current is\nachieved on the time scale of the longitudinal spin flip time, which is of the order\n\n\fDifferent steady states for spin currents in noncollinear multilayers\n\n4\n\nof a picosecond.[9, 10] The salient difference in the two views is that we find that the\ndiscontinuity in the spin current at the interfaces drives a transverse spin accumulation\nwhich in turn achieves a steady state distribution for the spin current; in this manner\nthe discontinuity is counterbalanced by accumulation so that \u2202t f (k, r, t) = 0. In the\nconventional treatments one has not considered this transverse accumulation, rather one\nsolved the transport equations of motion by setting \u2202t f = 0, and thereby assumed steady\nstate; if one inquires about the time to achieve this solution one would come up with\na nanosecond. We have solved the time dependent equations of motion for transport\nacross a noncollinear F/N/F structure using the same method we used for collinear\nstructures;[5] the new ingredient is the transverse components of the discontinuity in\nthe spin current. For thin normal layers,\u223c 10nm , it takes of the order of several\nfemtoseconds for the spin accumulation created at one N/F interface to reach the other\ninterface. When the layers are noncollinear the longitudinal accumulation created by the\nfirst interface has a component transverse to the magnetization of the second magnetic\nlayer. We find this drives a transverse accumulation of spin in the second magnetic layer\nwhich leads to a steady state solution in which the spin current is continuous across the\ninterfaces.[11] In the presence of differences in band structure across interfaces it is\nnecessary to include the current driven spin flip scattering at interfaces to inject a spin\ncurrent with a component transverse to the magnetization of a ferromagnetic layer; if\none limits oneself to the equilibrium transmission coefficients there is no excitation of\nthe transverse spin current across an interface and thereby no transverse accumulation,\ni.e., the steady state solutions with and without the interface spin flip scattering are\nindeed different. For example we have found the resistivity for noncollinear structures\nis always lower when we consider this additional scattering.[12]\nTo exhibit the main differences in our approach compared to the conventional one we\nhave solved for electron transport in a noncollinear magnetic trilayer F/N/F by using the\nsemiclassical Boltzmann equation of motion; we assumed that the nonmagnetic spacer\nis thin compared to the spin diffusion length so that one can effectively reduce the\ntransport calculation that of two noncollinear ferromagnetic layers with transmission\ncoefficients given in terms of the N/F transmission amplitudes of the trilayer.[13] We\ntake spin split but otherwise free electron bands; this is sufficient to model the band\nmismatch in the 3d transition-metal ferromagnets. Parenthetically, we have derived the\nequations for a Fermi sea of electrons; when we neglect the current driven corrections\nto the Fermi sea and focus only on the Fermi surface (see below) our equations are the\nsame as those we find by using the s \u2212 d model.[10] In each layer the energy and density\nvary slowly on the length scale of the Fermi wavelength so that we can limit ourselves\nto the first term in the gradient expansion of the equation of motion.[14] When we limit\nourselves to linear response in the external electric field we find the equations of motion\nfor the elements of the spinor density matrix for each momentum state on the Fermi\nsurface kp are,[15]\n\u2202t fp + vpx \u2202x fp \u2212 eEvp \u03b4(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5F ) = \u2212\n\nfp \u2212 hfp i fp \u2212 hfp\u2032 i\n\u2212\n,\n\u03c4p\n\u03c4sf\n\n(1)\n\n\fDifferent steady states for spin currents in noncollinear multilayers\n\n5\n\nand\nfp\u00b1 \u2212 fp\u00b1\nJp \u00b1\n,\n(2)\nfp = \u2212\n~\n\u03c4p\nwhere we have used a simplified index p to denote the momentum kp of a state on the\nnth sheet of the Fermi surface(we suppress this index), p\u2032 are states of opposite spin to\np, the average hfp i represents elastic scattering to all states on the Fermi surface, vpx is\nthe component of the Fermi velocity along the electric field E, J is the magnetic part\nof the energy and we have limited the current induced variations of the distribution\nfunction to those along the growth direction of a multilayered structure x (also the field\ndirection). The diagonal elements fp = f\u03b1\u03b1 (kp , x) represents the occupancy of the state\nkp ; in equilibrium it is given by the Fermi function so that only the spin state \u03b1 that\ncrosses the Fermi level is occupied while the other is zero and we do not consider it\nfurther. The off diagonal elements fp\u00b1 \u223c f\u2191\u2193 (kp , x), which we call a current induced spin\ncoherence,[16] represent coherences between the state kp on the Fermi surface and the\nstates with opposite spin; these coherences occur when we drive a spin current across a\nN/F interface.[7] The scattering terms include those for states of the same spin on the\n\u22121\n\u22121\nFermi surface \u03c4p\u22121 as well as those between sheets of opposite spin \u03c4sf\n; as \u03c4sf\n\u226a \u03c4p\u22121\nwe include the latter only to have well defined boundary conditions on our distribution\nfunctions.\nThe steady state (\u2202t fp = 0) solutions for the longitudinal components fp are\nwell know.[17] From Eqs.(1) and (2) we see that the electric field only creates out\nof equilibrium longitudinal components of the distribution functions; in a homogeneous\nmagnetic layer there is no coupling to the transverse components fp\u00b1 . However when\nthe spin current from one layer is injected into another noncollinear magnetic layer the\ntransverse components can be excited provided one includes the current induced spin flip\nscattering at the interface; their inclusion removes the discontinuity in the spin current\nat the interfaces. When we neglect collisions (the rhs of Eq.(2)) the transverse solutions\nin steady state are fp\u00b1 (x) \u223c exp \u00b1i(Jp /~vpx )x; when we average this over the Fermi\nsurface we find an interference between individual p or k states so that the transverse\nR\ncomponents of the spin currents in the magnetic layers, jx\u00b1 (x) \u223c vx (k)f \u00b1 (k, x)dk ,\ncan be fit to a form approximating an exponential decay \u223c exp \u2212x/\u03bbtr . In the ballistic\nregime \u03bbtr = dJ \u2261 hvF /J where the bar denotes an average over states on the nth\nsheet of the Fermi surface under consideration; [15] while for diffusive systems where\np\nwe consider the collision terms we find \u03bbtr = \u03bbJ \u2261 dJ \u03bbmf p /3\u03c0 when using the spin\ndiffusion equation.[10] Therefore when components of the spin current are injected into\na magnetic layer that are transverse to its magnetization, we find they propagate a\ndistance \u03bbtr before decaying; as this distance is an order of magnitude greater than\nthe Fermi wavelength one can describe the transverse spin currents in the semiclassical\nBoltzmann approach. As \u03bbtr is comparable to the thickness of the magnetic layers\nundergoing switching one cannot assume the transverse components of spin currents are\nentirely absorbed in such thin layers.\nThe salient results we find from the steady state solutions of the above equations\n\u2202t fp\u00b1 + vpx \u2202x fp\u00b1 \u2213 i\n\n\f6\n\n(a)\n\nd =12nm\n\n(nm)\n\nJ\n\n(b)\n\ntr\n\n\u03bb\n\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nd =6.28nm\nJ\n\nd =1nm\nJ\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\n\u03bb\n\nmfp\n\n(nm)\n\n\u03bb\n\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\ntr\n\n(nm)\n\nDifferent steady states for spin currents in noncollinear multilayers\n\n\u03bb\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nd\n\nJ\n\n15\n\n=6nm\n\nmfp\n\n20\n\n25\n\n(nm)\n\nFigure 1.

In fig(a) we show the variation as a\nfunction of mean free path for different dJ ; in (b) the variation with dJ for a mean free\npath equal to 6nm.\n\nare: transverse spin current and accumulation exist in the magnetic layers up to \u03bbtr \u223c3\nnm from the interface in the ballistic regime, there is no discontinuity in the spin current\nprovided one has included the spin flip at the interface, and when we include diffuse\nscattering in the layers \u03bbtr is by and large different from the \u03bbJ found from the spin\ndiffusion equation.[9] In Fig.1 we show the variation of the transverse decay length\n\u03bbtr as a function of the exchange splitting J and the mean free path \u03bbmf p ; for the\nparameters that describe Co we find the solutions found from the Boltzmann equation\nare reasonably well described by the spin diffusion equation in which one has neglected\nthe spin splitting of the bands but included diffuse interface scattering as a resistance.[9]\nIn these calculations the coherence between states of opposite spin are kept intact,\nbecause we have not used a spin polarized effective one electron description of the\nbands in the ferromagnetic layers. When we use the spin split band description we are\nable to retrieve the hallmark of the coherence, i.e., continuity of spin current across the\ninterface, if we include the spin flip scattering coefficients at the interfaces; by using\nonly the equilibrium transmission coefficients we find the spin current is discontinuous.\nWe conclude that for spin transport in noncollinear multilayers it is more important to\nkeep track of the spin coherence between states of opposite spin in ferromagnetic layers\nthan the precise details of the spin split band structure.\nWe have also started to determine the time dependent solutions for the transport\nequations in noncollinear structures.[11] Initially there is a discontinuity in the spin\ncurrent at the interfaces; the longitudinal component of this discontinuity is relaxed by\nthe random spin flip scattering in the bulk of the layers.[5] The transverse components\nare relaxed by the third term on the left hand side of Eq.(2); however if one does\nnot include the spin flip scattering at the interfaces the transverse components of the\ndistribution function are not excited and there is no relaxation, i.e., one does not have\n\n\fDifferent steady states for spin currents in noncollinear multilayers\n\n7\n\na steady state solution, rather the discontinuity in the transverse component of the\nspin current remains until the free magnetic layer switches. We have also calculated\nthe resistance of noncollinear trilayers (modelled as bilayers), and always find their\nresistance is lower when we include the interface spin flip scattering.[12]\nIn conclusion the steady state arrived at by using only the equilibrium transmission\ncoefficients for noncollinear magnetic multilayers has different attributes from the one\nreached when either one uses the current induced interface scattering, or neglects the\nspin splitting of the band structure. They differ in their resistances, length scales of\nspin transfer, magnitudes of spin torque created, and the time to reach steady state.\nSpecifically, providing all other things are equal, the spin torque in our model is less\nthan that found in the conventional ones when the thickness of the layer to be switched\nis less than the transverse decay length which is of the order of 2-3 nm. These differences\nshould be within the reach of current experimental conditions to ascertain which picture\nbetter fits the data.\nWe would like to thank Professor Shufeng Zhang for very helpful discussions.\nResearch supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant DMR 0131883.\n[1] J.C.
