C OLLMAR 3\n\nABSTRACT\nTriggered by the earlier surprising detection of pulsed hard X-ray emission from 1E 1841-045, we investigated\nthe time-averaged high-energy spectral characteristics of the established Anomalous X-ray Pulsars, 1RXS J1708 4009, 4U 0142 + 61, 1E 2259 + 586 and 1E 1048.1 - 5937, all with persistent X-ray emission. We report on\nthe discovery of hard spectral tails for energies above 10 keV in the total and pulsed spectra of AXPs 1RXS\nJ1708 - 4009, 4U 0142 + 61 and 1E 2259 + 586 using RXTE PCA (2-60 keV) / HEXTE (15-250 keV) data and\nINTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI (20-300 keV) data. 1E 1048.1 - 5937 appeared to be too weak to be detected with the\npresently available exposure. Furthermore, improved spectral information for 1E 1841-045 is presented. The\npulsed and total spectra measured above 10 keV have power-law shapes and there is so far no significant evidence\nfor spectral breaks or bends up to \u223c 150 keV. The pulsed spectra above 10 keV are exceptionally hard with indices\nmeasured for four AXPs approximately in the range -1.0 \u2013 1.0. The indices measured for these pulsed spectra\nbelow 10 keV were in the range 2.0 \u2013 4.3, indicating the very drastic spectral changes in a narrow energy interval\naround 10 keV, where clear minima are found in luminosity. The best fit power-law models to the total spectra\nbetween \u223c 10 and 150 keV are significantly softer, with indices measured for three AXPs, 1E 1841-045, 1RXS\nJ1708 - 4009 and 4U 0142 + 61 in the range 1.0 \u2013 1.4. For the latter AXPs the pulsed fractions are consistent with\n100% around 100 keV, but are different at 10 keV: 4U 0142 + 61 \u223c 10%, 1E 1841-045 \u223c25%, and 1RXS J1708 4009 consistent with 100%. The luminosities of these total and pulsed spectral tails (10- 150 keV) largely exceed\nthe total available spin-down powers by factors ranging from \u223c 100 to \u223c 600. This shows that also these new\nhard-X-ray components cannot be powered by rotational energy loss. We reanalyzed archival CGRO COMPTEL\n(0.75-30 MeV) data to search for signatures from our set of AXPs. No detections can be claimed, but the obtained\nupper-limits to soft gamma-ray emission in this MeV range indicates for 1RXS J1708 - 4009, 4U 0142 + 61 and\n1E 1841-045 that strong breaks or bends must occur somewhere between \u223c 150 keV and 750 keV. We discuss\npredictions from first attempts to model our hard X-ray / soft gamma-ray spectra in the context of the magnetar\nmodel. Our spectral results cannot yet discriminate between the different proposed scenarios. Particularly, more\nconstraining information is required on the detailed shape of the spectra between \u223c 150 keV (our highest data\npoints from INTEGRAL) and 750 keV, from where we report the COMPTEL upper limits.\nSubject headings: pulsars: individual (1RXS J1708 - 4009; 4U 0142 + 61; 1E 2259 + 586;1E 1048.1 - 5937;1E\n1841-045), X-rays: stars\nal. 2005). These properties provide strong evidence that both\nAXPs and SGRs are members of the same source class.\nThe X-ray spectra of AXPs in the 0.5-10 keV band are very\nsoft and can best be described by a black body plus a power-law\nmodel. The softness of the spectra below 10 keV (power-law\nindices 2 < \u0393 < 4, with F\u03b3 \u221d E \u2212\u0393 ) predicts non-detections for\nenergies above 10 keV and thus explains the initial ignorance\nfor studying the spectral properties of AXPs at energies above\n10 keV.\nIt was a great surprise that the high-resolution imaging instrument IBIS/ISGRI aboard ESA's INTEGRAL satellite measured hard X-rays from the direction of three AXPs. Firstly,\nMolkov et al. (2004) reported the discovery of an INTEGRAL\nsource at the position of AXP 1E 1841-045 in SNR Kes 73\nfor energies up to 120 keV (60\u2013120 keV: 7.5 \u03c3). This was followed up by Kuiper et al. (2004), who analysed archival RXTE\nPCA and HEXTE data from monitoring observations spread\nover four years, to prove that the hard X-ray emission comes\nfrom the AXP and not from the SNR. They discovered nonthermal pulsed hard X-ray / soft \u03b3-ray emission up to \u223c 150\nkeV with a spectrum with power-law photon index of \u223c 0.94.\nSecondly, Revnivtsev et al. (2004) published the INTEGRAL\ndetection (18\u201360 keV: 6.5 \u03c3) of AXP 1RXS J170849.0 - 400910\n(we use throughout this paper: 1RXS J1708 - 4009), also in\na spatial analysis of ISGRI data. Similarly, den Hartog et al.\n(2004) reported the detection of AXP 4U 0142 + 61 (50\u2013100\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nAnomalous X-ray pulsars (AXP) belong to a class of rare\nobjects closely concentrated along the Galactic plane, known\nto emit pulsed X-rays for energies below 10 keV with pulse periods in the range \u223c 6 - 12 s and characteristic spin-down time\nscales of \u223c 103 - 105 year. Two, probably three, members of this\nclass are embedded in a shell-like supernova remnant (SNR;\nsee e.g. Gregory & Fahlman 1980; Kriss et al. 1985). The fact\nthat the observed X-ray luminosity is much larger than the spindown power excludes an interpretation in which the (pulsed) Xray emission originates from a spin-down powered pulsar. On\nthe other hand, the steady spin-down without a doppler modulated signature and the lack of bright optical counterparts make\nan X-ray binary interpretation, in which mass transfer (accretion) powers the high-energy emission of the system, very unlikely (see Mereghetti et al. 2002, for a review on AXPs). Currently, models based on the decay of very strong magnetic fields\n(1014 -1015 Gauss) - so called \"magnetar\" models (Thompson &\nDuncan 1996) - seem to explain the observed high-energy characteristics of AXPs at a satisfactory level. For instance, the recently detected bursts from the AXPs 1E 1048.1 - 5937 (Gavriil\net al. 2002b) and 1E 2259 + 586 (Kaspi et al. 2003) mimic the\nbursting behaviour of Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGR) for\nwhich the magnetar model was initially developed. Also, the\n\"glitch\" phenomenon detected in the spin-down of some AXP\nmembers fits in this model (Kaspi et al. 2000, 2003; Morii et\n1\n\n\f2\n\nKuiper et al.\n\nkeV: 6.1 \u03c3) which exhibited a very hard total spectrum above 20\nkeV. These three AXPs reach about the same flux level around\n100 keV.\nIn this paper we present the results from follow-up studies\nusing archival RXTE PCA and HEXTE data of 1RXS J1708 4009, 4U 0142 + 61, 1E 2259 + 586 and 1E 1048.1 - 5937 aimed\nat studying their timing and spectral characteristics above 10\nkeV. We also revisit the pulsed high-energy emission properties\nof 1E 1841-045 above 10 keV using more RXTE PCA data and\napplying now more-optimized event selection criteria. Furthermore, we explored the INTEGRAL database using both public,\nprivate and core program data to derive the total X-ray emission spectra of the five AXPs mentioned above, and reanalyze\narchival data from COMPTEL (Sch\u00f6nfelder et al. 1993), delivering constraining upper limits in the soft gamma-ray band\n0.75-30 MeV. Finally, initial results will be shown from IBIS\nISGRI timing analysis studies of 1RXS J1708 - 4009 and 1E\n1841-045.\n2. INSTRUMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS\n\n2.1. Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer\nIn this study extensive use is made of data from monitoring\nobservations of AXPs with the two non-imaging X-ray instruments aboard RXTE, the Proportional Counter Array (PCA; 260 keV) and the High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE;\n15-250 keV). The PCA (Jahoda et al. 1996) consists of five collimated xenon proportional counter units (PCUs) with a total\neffective area of \u223c 6500 cm2 over a \u223c 1\u25e6 (FWHM) field of\nview. Each PCU has a front Propane anti-coincidence layer and\nthree Xenon layers which provide the basic scientific data, and\nis sensitive to photons with energies in the range 2-60 keV. The\nenergy resolution is about 18% at 6 keV.\nThe HEXTE instrument (Rothschild et al. 1998) consists of\ntwo independent detector clusters, each containing four Na(Tl)/\nCsI(Na) scintillation detectors. The HEXTE detectors are mechanically collimated to a \u223c 1\u25e6 (FWHM) field of view and\ncover the 15-250 keV energy range with an energy resolution\nof \u223c 15% at 60 keV. The collecting area is 1400 cm2 taking\ninto account the loss of the spectral capabilities of one of the\ndetectors. The maximum time resolution of the tagged events\nis 7.6\u03bcs. In its default operation mode the field of view of each\ncluster is switched on and off source to provide instantaneous\nbackground measurements. Due to the co-alignment of HEXTE\nand the PCA, they simultaneously observe the sources. Table\n1 lists the publicly available RXTE observations used in this\nstudy. In the fourth column the PCU unit-2 screened (see Sect\n3.1) exposure is given. A typical observation consists of several sub-observations spaced more or less uniformly between\nthe start and end date of the observation.\n2.2. INTEGRAL\nThe INTEGRAL spacecraft (Winkler et al. 2003), launched\n17 October 2002, carries two main \u03b3-ray instruments: a highangular-resolution imager IBIS (Ubertini et al. 2003) and a highenergy-resolution spectrometer SPI (Vedrenne et al. 2003). These\ninstruments make use of coded aperture masks enabling image\nreconstruction in the hard X-ray/soft \u03b3-ray band.\nIn our study, guided by sensitivity considerations, we only\nused data recorded by the INTEGRAL Soft Gamma-Ray Imager ISGRI (Lebrun et al. 2003), the upper detector system of\nIBIS, sensitive to photons with energies in the range \u223c20 keV\n\u2013 1 MeV.

Because we are mainly interested in the medium/hard\n(> 2 keV) X-ray timing properties of the selected sample of\nAXPs, we ignored the events triggered in the Propane layers\nof each PCU. Furthermore, contrary to the work presented in\nKuiper et al. (2004), we now used data from all three xenon\nlayers of each PCU, namely, employing data from the (deeper)\nmiddle and lower xenon layers considerably improves the signalto-noise ratio for energies above \u223c 10 keV. This allows us to\nbetter characterize the hard (> 10 keV) X-ray properties of\nAXPs.\nThe number of active PCUs at any time was changing, therefore, we treated the five PCUs constituting the PCA separately.\nGood time intervals have been determined for each PCU by\nincluding only time periods when the PCU in question is on,\nand during which the pointing direction is within 0.\u25e6 05 from\nthe target, the elevation angle above Earth's horizon is greater\nthan 5\u25e6 , a time delay of 30 minutes since the peak of a SouthAtlantic-Anomaly passage holds, and a low background level\ndue to contaminating electrons is observed. These good time\nintervals have subsequently been applied in the screening process to the data streams from each of the PCUs (e.g. see Table\n1 for the resulting screened exposure of PCU-2 per observation\nthat the clock behaviour is stable, making deep timing studies\nrun).\nof weak pulsars possible.\nNext, for each sub-observation the arrival times of the seIn its default operation mode INTEGRAL observes the sky in\nlected events (for each PCU unit) have been converted to arrival\n\u25e6\na dither pattern with 2 steps, which could be rectangular e.g.\ntimes at the solar system barycenter (in TDB (=barycentric dya 5 \u00d7 5 dither pattern with 25 grid points, or hexagonal with\nnamical time) time scale; DE200 solar system ephemeris) using\n7 grid points (target in the middle). Typical integration times\nthe instantaneous spacecraft position and the celestial positions\nfor each grid point (pointing/sub-observation) are in the range\nof the selected sample of AXPs. In this work we used for the\n1800 - 3600 seconds. This strategy drives the structure of the\nAXP positions those obtained by the Chandra X-ray observaINTEGRAL data archive which is organised in so-called scitory with a typical position accuracy of about 0.\u2032\u2032 5 (for 1RXS\nence windows (Scw) per INTEGRAL orbital revolution (lastJ1708 - 4009, see Israel et al.

For the calculation of these significances we applied\n\u03b3-ray band adjacent to the INTEGRAL one. The very hard\nin this work the bin-free Zn2 statistic (Buccheri et al. 1983),\nspectra that we measured with IBIS ISGRI for some AXPs warwhich behaves as a \u03c72 distribution for 2n degrees of freedom\nranted us to revisit the COMPTEL data archive to search for\n(n=number of harmonics). However, phase shifts between the\nsignals from AXPs.

Therefore we correlated the pulse phase distribucovering \u223c1 steradian. Imaging in its large field of view is postion of each sub-observation with a chosen initial template and\n\n\f4\n\nKuiper et al.\n\napplied the measured phase shifts to obtain an aligned combination with much higher statistics. The correlation is then\nonce repeated with, instead of the initially chosen template, the\naligned combination from the first correlation to obtain the final summed profile (see e.g. de Plaa et al. 2003, for a similar\niterative method applied for PSR B0540-69).\nThe net result is a set of aligned high-statistics pulse profiles\nin 256 energy channels for each of the AXPs in our sample. It\nshould be noted that these profiles are time-averaged profiles\nignoring possible temporal variations in shape and/or pulsed\nfraction (see e.g. Rea et al. (2005) for 1RXS J1708 - 4009; Rea\net al. (2006) for 4U 0142 + 61; and Gavriil & Kaspi (2004);\nTiengo et al. (2005) for 1E 1048.1 - 5937).\nHEXTE operated in its default rocking mode during the observations listed in Table 1, allowing the collection of real-time\nbackground data from two independent positions \u00b11.\u25e6 5 to either side of the on-source position. For the timing analysis\nwe selected only the on-source data. Good time intervals have\nbeen determined using similar screening filters as used in the\ncase of the PCA. The selected on-source HEXTE event times\nhave subsequently been barycentered and folded according to\nthe available ephemerides (see PCA part at the beginning of\nthis section) using again only the first three frequency coefficients. Applying, for each AXP in our sample, the phase shifts\nas derived from the contemporaneous PCA measurements to\nthe HEXTE phase distributions of each sub-observation we obtained the time averaged HEXTE pulse phase distributions in\n256 spectral channels (15 - 250 keV) for the combination of\nobservations listed in Table 1.\n3.2. RXTE PCA/HEXTE spectral analysis\nBecause of the non-imaging nature of the two main RXTE\ninstruments the (total) source-flux estimation relies on accurate\ntime-dependent instrumental and celestial background measurements. Although such models exist for the PCA, the complexity of the near environment of the AXPs in our sample makes\nit very difficult to derive reliable unbiased total flux estimates\nwith the PCA in the 2-30 keV range. Specifically, all AXPs\nare located in a narrow strip along the Galactic plane where\n(large) gradients in the Galactic ridge emission exist (Valinia\net al. 1998); 1E 1841-045 and 1E 2259 + 586 are located in\nsupernova remnants; time-variable strong sources are present\nnear to 4U 0142 + 61 (Be X-ray binary RX J0146.9+6121), 1E\n1048.1 - 5937 (the enigmatic \u03b7 Carina) and 1RXS J1708 - 4009\n(e.g. the strong and highly variable X-ray binaries OAO 1657415 and 4U 1700-377).\nThe rocking strategy applied during HEXTE operations in\nprinciple provides instantaneous background measurements, but\nalso in this case the gradient in the Galactic ridge emission and\nthe possible presence of other (strong) sources in both the on\nand off-source pointings (very serious for e.g. 1RXS J1708 4009 and 4U 0142 + 61) can result in unreliable (background\nsubtracted) total-source-flux measurements. Therefore we abandoned, in contrast to the work presented in Kuiper et al. (2004)\nfor 1E 1841-045 in Kes 73, the derivation of the total-source\nflux with the non-imaging PCA and HEXTE instruments.\nIn this work we concentrate on the derivation of the timeaveraged pulsed PCA/HEXTE spectra of the AXPs in our sample. This can be done by determining the number of pulsed\ncounts in differential PCA/HEXTE energy bands by fitting a\n\ntruncated Fourier series\nN\nX\nN(\u03c6) = a0 +\nak cos(2\u03c0k\u03c6) + bk sin(2\u03c0k\u03c6)\n\n(1)\n\nk=1\n\nwith \u03c6 the pulse phase, to the measured pulse phase distributions N(\u03c6). It turned out that 3 to 5 harmonics (N = 3/5) were\nsufficient to describe the measured distributions accurately for\nall energy intervals and AXPs in our sample. In the case of\nthe PCA we derived for each PCU the energy response matrix (energy redistribution including the sensitive area) for the\ncombination of observations listed in Table 1 and subsequently\ntook the different PCU (screened) exposure times into account\nin the construction of the weighted PCU-combined energy response. The pulsed (excess) counts per energy band are fitted\nin a procedure assuming either an absorbed power-law (F\u03b3 =\nK * e\u2212NH *\u03c3 * E\u03b3\u2212\u0393 ), or an absorbed double power-law (F\u03b3 = e\u2212NH *\u03c3 *\n(K1 * E\u03b3\u2212\u03931 + K2 * E\u03b3\u2212\u03932 )) or an absorbed black body plus powerlaw (F\u03b3 = e\u2212NH *\u03c3 * (K * E\u03b3\u2212\u0393 + Kbb * E\u03b32 /(exp(E\u03b3 /kT ) \u2212 1))) photon\nspectrum folded through the PCU-combined energy response.\nIn the spectral \"deconvolution\" process of the HEXTE total pulsed counts in almost all cases4 the on-axis cluster A and\nB energy response matrices have been employed taking into account the (slightly) different screened on-source exposure times\nfor each cluster. The exposure times have been corrected for the\nconsiderable deadtime effects.\n3.3. INTEGRAL timing analysis\nThe first step in an INTEGRAL timing analysis is to obtain\na set of science windows for which the angular distance between instrument pointing direction and target is within 14.\u25e6 5\nto ensure that (a part of) the detector plane is illuminated by the\ntarget. The resulting list is further screened on erratic (ISGRI)\ncount rate variations, indicative for particle effects due to Earth\nradiation belt passages or solar flare activities. These science\nwindows are excluded for further analysis. Next, only events\nwith rise times between 7 and 90 (see Lebrun et al. 2003, for\ndefinition), detected in non-noisy ISGRI detector pixels which\nhave an illumination factor of more than 25% (i.e. at least 25%\nof a detector pixel must have been illuminated by the target) are\npassed for further analysis. The on-board event time stamps are\ncorrected for known instrumental (fixed), ground station and\ngeneral time delays in the on-board time vs. TT (Terrestrial\nTime) correlation (see e.g. Walter et al. 2003). The resulting\nevent times in TT of the selected events are barycentered (using\nthe JPL DE200 solar system ephemeris) adopting the Chandra\nX-ray positions of the AXPs and the instantaneous INTEGRAL\norbit information. These barycentered events are finally folded\nusing an appropriate timing model (\u03bd, \u03bd\u0307, \u03bd\u0308 and the epoch) to\nyield pulse phase distributions for different energy bands between 20 and 300 keV. The timing models (phase connecting\nephemerides) are based on publicly available RXTE monitoring\ndata of AXPs. Ephemerides have been generated for two AXPs\nin our sample, 1RXS J1708 - 4009 and 1E 1841-045, because\nat the INTEGRAL epoch (MJD > 52668 and MJD > 52698\nfor 1RXS J1708 - 4009 and 1E 1841-045, respectively) these\nwere not available from existing literature (see Table 3; all with\nvery small RMS values, required for extracting the weak pulsed\nsignals).\nFor HEXTE pointings with the target (AXP) far off-axis e.g. 4U 0142 + 61\nduring an observation of HMXB RX J0146.9+6121, we took the reduction in\nthe effective sensitive area due to the collimator response into account\n\n4\n\n\fDetection of hard soft \u03b3-ray emission from AXPs\n\n5\n\nTABLE 3\nP HASE COHERENT EPHEMERIDES FOR 1RXS J1708 - 4009\n\nAND 1E 1841-045, DERIVED FROM\nVALID FOR THE ANALYZED INTEGRAL OBSERVATIONS .\n\nAXP\n1RXS J1708 - 4009\n1E 1841-045\n\nStart\n[MJD]\n52590\n52726\n\nEnd\n[MJD]\n52939\n52982\n\nEpoch\n[MJD,TDB]\n52590.0\n52726.0\n\n3.4. INTEGRAL spectral analysis\nThe INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI spectral analysis applied in our\nstudy is based on OSA 4.1 programs producing sky mosaics\nfor the combination of many science windows in different energy bands (Goldwurm et al. 2003). The resulting dead-time\ncorrected ISGRI source-count rates per energy band are referenced to count rates measured from the Crab in similar energy\nbands (Crab calibration observations during INTEGRAL Revs.\n102/103 were used).\nWe used for the total Crab photon emission spectrum the following spectrum derived by Willingale et al. (2001) based on\nXMM-Newton observations of the Crab at energies between 0.3\nand 10 keV: photon index \u0393 = 2.108(6) with a normalization at\n1 keV of 9.59(5) ph/(cm2s keV).\nWe verified the validity of the extrapolation of this spectrum to energies between 15 and 250 keV using RXTE HEXTE\nCrab data. The HEXTE data utilized is from a long dedicated\nRXTE Crab observation (obs. id. 40805), performed between\n17-31 March 1999 and 18-19 Dec. 1999, yielding dead time\ncorrected cluster 0 and 1 exposures of 22.7 and 23.8 ks, respectively. Applying an overall (energy independent) normalization factor of 1.087 to be consistent with the BeppoSAX\nLECS/MECS/PDS spectrum (Kuiper et al. 2001) the derived\n15-250 keV HEXTE Crab total spectrum connects smoothly to\nthe 0.3-10 keV Crab total spectrum derived by Willingale et al.\n(2001). The HEXTE Crab total spectrum can best be described\nby a power-law model with an energy dependent photon index\nas given below:\nF\u03b3 = 1.5703(14) \u00d7 (E\u03b3/0.06355)\u22122.097(2)\u22120.0082(16)*ln(E\u03b3 /0.06355)\n(2)\nIn Eq.2, F\u03b3 is expressed in ph/(cm2 s MeV) and E\u03b3 in MeV. Up\nto \u223c 180 \u2212 200 keV the extrapolation of the spectrum given by\nWillingale et al. (2001) overlaps the HEXTE spectrum, and thus\nprovides a proper representation for the ISGRI energy range we\nare effectively dealing with.\nTherefore, our method for deriving ISGRI spectra enables\nus to determine the 20-300 keV AXP spectra without detailed\nknowledge of the instrument energy response, which at the time\nof our analysis still contained significant uncertainties. Thus,\nwe derive from these spatial analyses total source spectra (sum\nof pulsed and unpulsed components).\nFor the construction of spectra for the pulsed components\nwe extracted count rates from the phase distributions similarly\nas was done for the RXTE light curves. For the conversion\nto pulsed fluxes, also in this case, the Crab pulsed signal in\nthe HEXTE 15 - 250 keV range (obs. id. 40805) was used as\na reference source. This pulsed HEXTE spectrum is properly\ndescribed by:\nF\u03b3 = 0.4693(21) \u00d7 (E\u03b3/0.04844)\u22121.955(7)\u22120.0710(78)*ln(E\u03b3 /0.04844)\n(3)\n\n\u03bd\n[Hz]\n0.09089812328(36)\n0.0848972590(50)\n\nRXTE PCA MONITORING DATA AND\n\n\u03bd\u0307\n\u00d710\u221213 Hz/s\n-1.59836(30)\n-3.2217(85)\n\n\u03bd\u0308\n\u00d710\u221222 Hz/s2\n0.00(Fixed)\n4.22(83)\n\nRMS\n0.012\n0.015\n\nover the entire 15-250 keV energy range.

COMPTEL spatial analysis\nDuring the long mission lifetime of CGRO (April, 1991 \u2013\nMay, 2000), most of the sky, particularly the Galactic Plane,\nhas been viewed with long exposures. We used the exposure\naccumulated for each source over the total mission duration,\namounting for 1RXS J1708 - 4009 5.3 Ms, 4U 0142 + 61 4.2\nMs, 1E 2259 + 586 4.9 Ms, 1E 1048.1 - 5937 4.8 Ms, and for\n1E 1841-045 4.2 Ms. Skymaps and source parameters can be\nderived with the maximum likelihood method, which is implemented in the standard COMPTEL data analysis package. See\nfor the implementation of the maximum likelihood method for\ndata from a Compton telescope (de Boer et al. 1992), and for the\nspecific treatment of the instrumental background structure in\nthe COMPTEL data space (Bloemen et al. 1994). For the analysis and data selections we followed the approach described by\nZhang et al. (2004). Standard energy intervals were selected for\nthe analysis: 0.75 \u2013 3 MeV, 3 \u2013 10 MeV and 10 \u2013 30 MeV. For\neach of these energy intervals and for each AXP the source flux\n(or upper limit) was measured at the known source position in\nthe maximum likelihood skymaps.\n4. 1RXS J1708 - 4009\n\n1RXS J1708 - 4009 was discovered in 1996 during the ROSAT\n(0.1-2.4 keV) all sky survey. X-ray pulsations at a 11-s period\nwere subsequently detected with ASCA (Sugizaki et al. 1997).\nIts 0.8-10 keV spectrum turned out to be very soft and its general X-ray properties pointed to an AXP membership (see e.g.\nIsrael et al. 1999a; Kaspi et al. 1999). From regular RXTE\nPCA monitoring observations performed between Jan. 1998\nand June 1999 a phase-coherent timing solution was obtained\nby Kaspi et al. (1999). This demonstrated a high level of rotation stability. Since these early monitoring observations, however, the source experienced two glitches - one in Sept./Oct.\n1999 and a second in April 2001 - each with different recovery\nbehaviour (Kaspi et al. 2000; Kaspi & Gavriil 2003; Dall'Osso\net al. 2003). For the period between the two glitches Gavriil &\nKaspi (2002) presented a phase-coherent timing solution with a\npositive \u03bd\u0308 indicative for a long-term glitch recovery.\nThe morphology of the X-ray pulse profile of 1RXS J1708 4009 is changing as a function of energy (e.g. Sugizaki et al.\n1997; Israel et al. 2001; Gavriil & Kaspi 2002). Phase-resolved\nspectral analyses indeed showed significant spectral variations\nwith pulse-phase, most pronounced in the photon power-law\nindex (e.g. Israel et al. 2001; Rea et al. 2003, 2005). Furthermore, the total phase-averaged unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray\nflux and photon spectral index appear to be time variable in a\ncorrelated way, with maximal fluxes and hardest spectra near\n\n\f6\n\nKuiper et al.\n\nF IG . 2.- Phase angles as a function of energy for the first 3 harmonics used\nin the truncated Fourier series fit (see Eq. 1) of the RXTE PCA pulse profiles\nof 1RXS J1708 - 4009.

Two cycles are shown for clarity. The\nvertical dotted lines at phases 0.25 and 0.55 serve as a guide to the eye for\nalignment comparisons. Note the drastic morphology changes with energy.\n\nthe two glitch epochs (Rea et al. 2005).\nAt optical/IR wavelengths 2 potential counterparts were identified within the Chandra 0.\u2032\u2032 7 HRC-I error circle (see e.g. Israel\net al. 2003; Safi-Harb & West 2005, for more details). A search\nfor radio emission at 1.4 GHz from 1RXS J1708 - 4009 only\nyielded a 5\u03c3 upper limit of 3 mJy at the position of the AXP\n(Gaensler et al. 2001).\nGiven the softness of the 0.5-10 keV X-ray spectra, the INTEGRAL detection reported by Revnivtsev et al. (2004) of a\npoint source at the position of 1RXS J1708 - 4009 between 18\nand 60 keV was a big surprise. Below we will present in detail\nthe new high-energy characteristics of this AXP derived in this\nwork: a) the discovery of the pulsed emission above \u223c 10 keV\n(profiles, spectra) using RXTE PCA/HEXTE and IBIS ISGRI\ndata; b) ISGRI and COMPTEL results on the total emission.\n4.1. 1RXS J1708 - 4009 timing characteristics\n4.1.1. RXTE PCA/HEXTE pulse profiles\nApplying the timing analysis procedures outlined in Sect. 3.1\nto the full set of RXTE observations of 1RXS J1708 - 4009\nlisted in Table 1, resulted in a compilation of high-statistics\ntime-averaged PCA/HEXTE pulse profiles for energies between\n\u223c 2 \u2212 220 keV (see Fig. 1). The ephemerides used in the folding/correlation process (see Sect. 3.1) are given in Kaspi et al.\n(2000); Gavriil & Kaspi (2002); Kaspi & Gavriil (2003). For\n\nthe first time pulsed emission is detected above \u223c 10 keV: the\nnon-uniformity significance of the 16.1-32.0 keV PCA pulse\nphase distribution (see Fig.1d) is 14.2\u03c3 applying a Z22 -test and\nthe HEXTE 35.2-222.9 keV profile (see Fig.1f) deviates from\nuniformity at a 5.2\u03c3 level. Above 35.2 keV the significances\nin the HEXTE 35.2-64.1 and 74.3- 222.9 keV bands (the intermediate energy window with a large instrumental background\nfeature has been omitted) are both 3.75\u03c3. Drastic morphology changes with energy are visible. The decomposition of the\npulse profiles in terms of a finite number of harmonics (see Eq.\n1) provides a means to visualize a change in morphology with\nenergy. The power (a2k + b2k , see Eq.1), derived from the timeaveraged PCA pulse profiles of 1RXS J1708 - 4009, in the first\nharmonic is dominant over the power in the second and third\nharmonics, and the power in harmonics with k \u2265 4 can be neglected (see also Gavriil & Kaspi 2002). From Eq. 1 one can\ndefine a phase angle \u03a6k\u03b1 = arctan(ak /bk ) for each harmonic k.\nThe energy dependence of \u03a6k\u03b1 for the first three harmonics is\nshown in Fig. 2. For each harmonic it reveals a very smooth\nvariation of the phase angle with energy. The shape of the profile is changing drastically between 2 and 10 keV. For energies\nabove \u223c 15 keV the phase angles for the 3 considered harmonics seem to converge to constant values, a necessary condition\nfor stable pulse shapes.\n4.1.2. INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI pulse profiles\nWe also performed a timing analysis for 1RXS J1708 - 4009\nusing IBIS ISGRI data. Data from science windows taken during INTEGRAL Revs. 36-120 satisfying our 14.\u25e6 5 off-axis constraint were included (effective on-axis exposure after screening \u223c 1,360 ks). The processing followed the guidelines presented in Sect. 3.3 using the 1RXS J1708 - 4009 ephemeris\ngenerated from RXTE monitoring observations, given in Table 3. In the integral 20-300 keV ISGRI band we obtained a\nnon-uniformity significance of 5.9\u03c3 applying a Z22 test, which\nis comparable to the HEXTE result. In differential energy bands\nwe found: 20-75 keV, 4.3\u03c3, and 75-300 keV 3.6\u03c3 (see Fig. 3\n\n\fDetection of hard soft \u03b3-ray emission from AXPs\n\nF IG . 3.- INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI pulse profiles of 1RXS J1708 - 4009 for\ntwo energy ranges. The non-uniformity significances are 4.3\u03c3 and 3.6\u03c3 for\n20-75 keV and 75-300 keV, respectively. Pulse maxima are found near phase\n\u223c 0.2, corresponding to phase 0.55 in Fig. 1.\n\nfor the corresponding pulse profiles). The HEXTE and the ISGRI profiles above 75 keV are very similar, and suggest that\nthe hard-X-ray 1RXS J1708 - 4009 profile exhibits less structure than found below 10 keV. From these initial ISGRI timing\nresults it is clear that highly significant profiles can be expected\nin the near future when significantly more IBIS ISGRI data on\nthis source become available.\n4.2. 1RXS J1708 - 4009 spectral characteristics\nIn this section we present new high-energy spectral information above 2.5 keV up to 30 MeV for 1RXS J1708 - 4009: (a)\n(time-averaged) pulsed emission from RXTE PCA and HEXTE;\n(b) pulsed emission from INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI; (c) total\n(pulsed and unpulsed) emission from ISGRI and upper limits to the total emission from CGRO COMPTEL. Finally, the\nnew spectra are compared with spectra reported earlier for energies below 10 keV (Rea et al. 2003, 2005, for BeppoSAX\nLECS/MECS 0.4-10.8 keV and XMM Newton MOS/PN 0.510 keV, respectively).\n4.2.1. RXTE PCA/HEXTE pulsed spectrum\nThe spectral procedures employed for the RXTE PCA and\nHEXTE data (see Sect. 3.2) resulted in a high-statistics determination of the spectrum of the time-averaged pulsed emission\nof 1RXS J1708 - 4009 in the \u223c 2.5 \u2212 220 keV energy range.\nThe PCA (aqua) flux values are derived assuming an absorbed\ndouble power-law spectral model, and are shown in a \u03bdF\u03bd representation in Fig. 4. Also drawn is the best fitting spectral model\nto the PCA data points (2.5-36.9 keV; \u03c72r = 1.11 for 12 degrees of freedom; dashed line). The assumed absorbing Hydrogen column density NH in the spectral fit was 1.36 \u00d7 1022cm\u22122\n(Rea et al. 2003). The two power-law components become\nequally strong at Ecross = 21.7 \u00b1 2.4 keV: below this energy\nthe power-law component with index \u03931 = 2.60 \u00b1 0.01 dominates and above a component with very hard spectrum, index\n\u03932 = \u22120.12 \u00b1 0.07. It is clear that the pulsed spectrum hardens\n\n7\n\nF IG . 4.- A \u03bdF\u03bd spectral representation of the total and pulsed high-energy\nemission from 1RXS J1708 - 4009. The aqua (PCA), blue (HEXTE) and magenta (IBIS ISGRI) data points show the time-averaged 2.5-300 keV pulsed\nspectrum. The black dashed line shows the best power-law model fit to the\ncombination of PCA, HEXTE and ISGRI pulsed flux values for energies above\n\u223c 15 keV. The other measurements refer to the total emission spectrum: 0.5-10\nkeV, BeppoSAX LECS/MECS and XMM Newton spectral models at different\nepochs (Rea et al. 2003,2005); 20-300 keV time-averaged (Revs. 36-106)\nIBIS ISGRI spectrum; and 0.75-30 MeV, time-averaged CGRO COMPTEL\n2\u03c3 upper-limits. Note the drastic hardening of the pulsed spectrum near 20\nkeV. The COMPTEL upper limits require another spectral break somewhere\nbetween 300 and 750 keV.\n\ndramatically above 20 keV, however, the spectrum has to soften\nconsiderably to be consistent with the index of 1.01(12) derived\nfrom a combination of PCA, HEXTE and IBIS ISGRI pulsed\nflux measurements for energies & 15 keV (see Sect.4.2.2). The\nHEXTE flux values (simultaneously derived) are fully consistent with the upturn found in the PCA spectrum (see Fig.4, blue\ndatapoints).\n4.2.2. INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI pulsed spectrum\nPulse profiles for 1RXS J1708 - 4009 have been generated in\nthree energy intervals from 20 to 300 keV using IBIS ISGRI\ndata from Revs 36-120. The pulsed (excess) count rates were\ndetermined and transformed to pulsed flux values, calibrated\non the pulsed Crab spectrum. The three flux values are also\nincluded in Fig. 4. They are consistent with the data points\nderived from RXTE HEXTE for the same energy window, but\nmeasured at different epochs. Within the present statistical accuracies there is no indication for long-term flux variability\nabove 20 keV, contrary to the reported strong flux variability\nfor energies below 10 keV, clearly visible in Fig. 4. A powerlaw fit through the PCA, HEXTE and IBIS ISGRI pulsed flux\nmeasurements for energies above 15 keV yielded a photon index of 1.01 \u00b1 0.12. This model is shown in Fig. 4 as a dashed\nblack line for the 15-300 keV energy range. There is no indication yet for a second spectral break up to 300 keV.\n4.2.3. INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI and COMPTEL total spectrum\n1RXS J1708 - 4009 was detected at a 6.5\u03c3 level in the 18-60\nkeV energy band by Revnivtsev et al. (2004) using IBIS ISGRI\ndata from a 2 Ms ultra deep INTEGRAL survey of the Galactic center region performed in Aug. - Sept. 2003 (INTEGRAL\n\n\f8\n\nKuiper et al.\n\nRevs. 104-107 & 111-113). Its 18-60 keV flux was 2.2 \u00b1 0.3\nmCrab. In this work we analyzed (almost independent) IBIS ISGRI data from all publicly available INTEGRAL observations\nperformed between revolutions 36 and 106 in which the angular distance between 1RXS J1708 - 4009 and the science window pointing was \u2264 14.\u25e65. The effective on-axis exposure after\nscreening is about 974 ks. Mosaic images have been made using OSA 4.1 procedures for 5 broad differential energy bands,\n20-35, 35-60, 60-100, 100-175 and 175-300 keV, in order to\ndetermine the total hard X-ray/soft \u03b3-ray spectrum of this AXP.\n1RXS J1708 - 4009 was detected significantly only in the 2035 and 35-60 keV energy bands with flux levels consistent with\nthe 18-60 keV flux measurement by Revnivtsev et al. (2004).\nThe resulting IBIS ISGRI spectral measurements are shown as\npurple data points in Fig. 4. Unfortunately, the statistics in\nthese IBIS ISGRI data points are still too poor to constrain the\nunderlying emission model in the 20-300 keV range: the fit\nquality specified by a reduced \u03c72r of 1.77 for 3 d.o.f. assuming a simple power-law model is still acceptable; the resulting\nphoton index is 1.44 \u00b1 0.45, slightly softer than, but consistent\nwith, the pulsed flux spectrum derived from the combined fit to\nthe PCA, HEXTE and IBIS ISGRI pulsed flux measurements\nat & 15 keV.\nFinally, at energies above 750 keV till 30 MeV we generated\nskymaps using all CGRO COMPTEL observations with 1RXS\nJ1708 - 4009 in its field of view, spread over its full 9 year mission lifetime. The source was not seen for any of the standard\nenergy intervals, and we derived (2\u03c3) flux upper limits, also\nshown in Fig. 4.\n4.2.4. Discussion of spectra and pulsed fraction of 1RXS\nJ1708 - 4009\nComparing the total IBIS ISGRI spectrum derived in the spatial analysis with the pulsed time-averaged spectra from RXTE\nPCA/HEXTE and ISGRI, we see that the 1RXS J1708 - 4009\nemission is consistent with about 100% pulsation for energies\nin excess of 20 keV. For energies below 20 keV, the situation is\nvery different. To highlight this, we included in Fig.4 the emission models (best spectral fits) for the total 0.5-10 keV X-ray\nspectra measured at two different epochs (Rea et al. 2003, 2005,\nfor BeppoSAX LECS/MECS 0.4-10.8 keV and XMM Newton\nMOS/PN 0.5-10 keV, respectively). Given the apparent drastic\nspectral change in both shape and normalization for energies\nbelow 10 keV we cannot uniquely quantify the pulsed fraction\nas a function of energy comparing with the time-averaged highstatistics PCA pulsed flux measurements. Obviously, the BeppoSAX measurement during August 2001 does not connect to\nthe RXTE/INTEGRAL spectra. 1RXS J1708 - 4009 was apparently in a (very) different high state during the BeppoSAX\nobservation, which took place in the recovering phase from the\nsecondly reported glitch (see Rea et al. 2005). The XMM Newton spectrum connects very smoothly to the total spectrum measured by INTEGRAL, and suggests a variation in pulsed fraction from \u223c 25% at 2 keV to 100% at 20 keV. Our time averaged results for the total and pulsed emission above 20 keV\nsuggest a very stable behaviour of this AXP at these higher energies. It seems that a stable and very hard pulsed component\nis dominating the emission at these energies. Interestingly, the\nCOMPTEL MeV upper limits then require a spectral break in\nthis hard spectrum of 1RXS J1708 - 4009 somewhere between\n300 and 750 keV.\n\n5. 4U 0142 + 61\n\n4U 0142 + 61 was discovered in the early seventies by the\nscanning Uhuru X-ray observatory (see e.g. Forman et al. 1978).\nThe X-ray sky survey performed by the SSI (1.5-20 keV) on\nAriel V (Warwick et al. 1981) and X-ray observations by SAS-3\nand HEAO-1 confirmed the source and refined its position considerably (see e.g. Reid et al. 1980, for an X-ray position with\n23\u2032\u2032 accuracy). Data from the non-imaging ME collimator (45\u2032\nFWHM) aboard EXOSAT revealed a coherent 25 minute signal,\nwhich was later absent in two shorter EXOSAT observations\n(White et al. 1987). These authors also presented more accurate (3.\u2032\u2032 2) positional information for 4U 0142 + 61 using both\nEXOSAT LEIT and Einstein (HEAO-2) HRI data and demonstrated the lack of a bright optical counterpart, ruling out the\npresence of a massive companion.\nThe discovery in ROSAT all-sky survey data of a Be/X-ray\nbinary, RX J0146.9+6121, by Motch et al. (1991) at only 24\u2032\nfrom 4U 0142 + 61 showed that there had been source confusion. Revisiting the EXOSAT 1985 data, Israel et al. (1994)\ndiscovered a 8.7 s periodicity, only detectable in the 1-3 keV energy band. Finally, using ROSAT PSPC data, Hellier (1994) unambiguously demonstrated that the 8.7 s periodicity originated\nfrom 4U 0142 + 61 and the 25 min signal from the Be/X-ray binary RX J0146.9+6121, which moreover showed transient activity.\nA good quality phase-averaged 0.5-10 keV X-ray spectrum\nof 4U 0142 + 61 was derived by White et al. (1996) analyzing ASCA SIS/GIS data. The physically most pausible model\nconsists of an absorbed black-body plus power-law component\nwith best-fit model parameters: black-body temperature 0.386(5)\nkeV; photon-index 3.67(9) and NH 9.5(4) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . These\nauthors, using data covering a much wider time baseline, also\nconfirmed the spin-down timescale of \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 105 year, reported earlier by Hellier (1994). The spin-down energy release\nis much lower than the observed X-ray luminosity, thereby excluding 4U 0142 + 61 to be a spin-down powered pulsar.\nRXTE monitoring observations since November 1996 (Gavriil\n& Kaspi 2002) proved that 4U 0142 + 61 is a very stable rotator, like spin-down powered pulsars, and ASCA data taken\nin a 2 year gap of RXTE observations seemed to indicate a\npulsar-like glitch in its rotation behaviour (Morii et al. 2005).\nTime-averaged RXTE PCA pulse profiles in two different energy bands showed significant morphology changes with energy, consistent with earlier results of much lower significance\n(Israel et al. 1994; White et al. 1996; Israel et al. 1999b).\nRecent X-ray observations of 4U 0142 + 61 by Chandra (Juett\net al. 2002; Patel et al. 2003) and XMM (G\u00f6hler et al. 2005) improved not only the positional accuracy down to 0.\u2032\u2032 5, but also\nprovided high-quality (phase-resolved) spectra which are mutually consistent and appeared featureless. The phase-resolved\nspectra showed significant changes in photon-index and black\nbody temperature as a function of pulse phase.\nAt lower energies, Hulleman et al. (2000) discovered a faint\noptical counterpart within the 4U 0142 + 61 Einstein X-ray error circle, followed by the detection of optical pulsations with\na high pulsed fraction from this counterpart (Kern & Martin\n2002). No radio counterpart has been found yet (Gaensler et al.\n2001).\nAt higher energies the discovery was reported by den Hartog et al. (2004) of hard X-rays/soft \u03b3-rays (20 \u2013 150 keV) in\nINTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI data of a deep 1.6 Ms observation of\nthe Cassiopeia region.

Two cycles are shown for\nclarity. The RXTE profiles shown in panels d\u2013i are time-averaged and based on\nobservations performed between March 1996 and September 2003. The GIS\nprofiles (panels a\u2013c) are from ASCA observations performed in July/August\n1999 totaling \u223c 120 ks of exposure. For the first time significant deviations\nfrom uniformity are visible at energies > 8 keV: Z22 is 16.6\u03c3 and 5.9\u03c3 for\nthe PCA 8.0-16.3 and 16.3-31.8 keV bands, respectively; the significances for\nthe HEXTE profiles are 3.4\u03c3 and 2.0\u03c3 for the 21.2-50.3 and 50.3-156.6 keV\nbands. Note the drastic morphology changes with energy.\n\nvation (den Hartog et al. 2006), proved that the spectrum in\nthis energy range is very hard with power-law photon index\n\u0393 = 0.73 \u00b1 0.17. The X-ray luminosity between 20 and 100\nkeV was found to be 5.9 \u00d7 1034 erg s\u22121 , a factor 440 higher than\nthe rotational energy loss. They also reported flux upper limits\nfrom COMPTEL between 0.75 and 30 MeV, which indicated\nthat the hard spectrum has to break/bend between \u223c 100 keV\nand 0.75 MeV.\nIn this work we will present for 4U 0142 + 61: a) for the first\ntime the PCA/ HEXTE timing and spectral results for energies\nabove \u223c 8 keV using all publicly available RXTE data, b) timing and spectral results from analysis of ASCA GIS 0.5 - 10\nkeV data, and c) a spectrum with higher statistical accuracy of\nthe total emission as seen by IBIS ISGRI over the 20-300 keV\nenergy range using all available public, Core Program (Galactic plane scans; 4U 0115+63 Target of Oppotunity Observation)\nand Open Time (Cassiopeia region; IGR J00291+5934 TOO)\nINTEGRAL data.\n5.1. 4U 0142 + 61 timing characteristics\nTime-averaged RXTE pulse profiles of 4U 0142 + 61 are shown\nin Fig. 5 for energies between 2.2 and 156.6 keV (PCA/HEXTE).\nWe used in the folding/correlation process (see Sect. 3.1) the\nephemerides given by Gavriil & Kaspi (2002). The 2.2-4.0 keV\nPCA profile (panel d) shows two distinct pulses near phases 0.2\nand 0.55. Moving up in energy the pulse near 0.2 loses significance and is gone for energies above \u223c 8 keV (panels e\u2013f).\n\nInstead above \u223c 8 keV a feature near phase 0.9 pops up, which\nis visible up to \u223c 50 keV (panels f\u2013h). Above 50 keV (panel i)\nthe phase region between the two pulses at 0.55 and 0.9 seems\nto be filled in by a new component, but the statistics is too poor\nto make stringent conclusions.\nMost importantly, we detect for the first time significant pulsed\nemission from 4U 0142 + 61 at energies above \u223c 8 keV: 16.6\u03c3\nand 5.9\u03c3 for the PCA 8.0-16.3 and 16.3-31.8 keV bands, respectively. To investigate further the increase in strength of\nthe pulse near phase 0.2 towards lower energies, we extended\nthe energy baseline by including also our results from a timing\nanalysis of ASCA GIS (0.5-10 keV) data from observations performed in July/August 1999 (\u223c 120 ks exposure). Three profiles (energy bands 0.5-1.7, 1.7-3.0 and 3.0-10 keV) are shown\nin panels a\u2013c of Fig.5. Indeed, for the pulse near phase 0.2 the\ntrend of increasing strength towards lower energies is continued\nin the ASCA GIS 0.5-1.7 and 1.7-3.0 keV energy ranges.\nA decomposition of the PCA pulse profiles in terms of 5\nFourier harmonics shows that above 2 keV most of the signal\npower is embedded in the first harmonic which becomes more\nand more dominant over the power in the second harmonic, the\nnext powerful harmonic, with increasing energy. Below \u223c 2\nkeV the power in the second harmonic is dominant over that in\nthe first. The behaviour of the phase angles \u03a6k\u03b1 as a function of\nenergy for the first three harmonics is shown in Fig. 6. Similar to 1RXS J1708 - 4009 but with different trends, also now a\nsmooth energy dependency of \u03a6k\u03b1 is shown for each harmonic\nwith significant power. The exception is the derivative of \u03a62\u03b1 to\nenergy which flips sign near 5 keV. For 4U 0142 + 61 it is less\nobvious that the pulse profile remains stable above 20 keV, than\nseems to be the case for 1RXS J1708 - 4009.\n5.2. 4U 0142 + 61 spectral characteristics\nIn this section we present: a) the time-averaged pulsed spectrum (2.2-102 keV) of 4U 0142 + 61 based on RXTE PCA and\nHEXTE measurements. The pulsed spectrum is extended down\nto 0.8 keV by including our spectral results from the ASCA\n\n\f10\n\nKuiper et al.\nden Hartog et al. (2006) report the detection and total spectrum of 4U 0142 + 61 in the 20-100 keV energy range analyzing IBIS ISGRI data from INTEGRAL observations of the Cassiopeia region performed in Dec. 2003 (Revs. 142 - 148). In\nthis work all available INTEGRAL data (open time/core program) have been used from observations made between 3 March\n2003 (Rev. 47) and 28 December 2004 (Rev. 269) in which\nthe source was within 14.\u25e6 5 from the pointing axis. The total\nscreened exposure time for the set of accumulated science windows is about 2 Ms, which corresponds to an effective on-axis\nexposure of about 858 ks. Image mosaics have been generated using OSA 4.1 software in 7 differential energy bands, 2030, 30-45, 45-65, 65-95, 95-140, 140-205 and 205-300 keV. In\nthese (time-averaged) maps5 4U 0142 + 61 is clearly detected\nup to and including the 95-140 keV energy range (7.8 \u00b1 1.0\nmCrab). The 20-300 keV flux measurements are shown as purple data points in Fig. 7. A simple power-law fit to these flux\npoints yielded a hard photon index of 1.05 \u00b1 0.11 (\u03c72r = 0.86\nfor d.o.f. 6 - 2; the purple dashed line in Fig. 7). The difference with the value (0.73 \u00b1 0.17) reported for the index by den\nHartog et al. (2006) is 1.6\u03c3.\n\nF IG . 7.- A \u03bdF\u03bd spectral representation of the total and pulsed high-energy\nemission from 4U 0142 + 61.

The COMPTEL 2\u03c3\nupper limits require a spectral break somewhere between 140 and 750 keV.\n\nGIS observations (\u223c120 ks); b) the time-averaged total (pulsed\nand unpulsed) spectrum from our analysis of INTEGRAL IBIS\nISGRI skymaps (20-300 keV), in comparison with that from\nChandra ACIS-S CC-mode data (0.5-7 keV; Patel et al. 2003)\nand the CGRO COMPTEL (0.75-30 MeV) upper limits (den\nHartog et al. 2006).\n5.2.1. RXTE PCA/HEXTE and ASCA GIS pulsed spectrum\nAssuming an underlying absorbed (NH = 9.3 \u00d7 1021cm\u22122 ; Patel et al. 2003) double power-law photon model we fitted the\npulsed PCA excess counts (2.2-31.5 keV) in a forward folding\nprocedure (see Sect. 3.2), resulting in a high-statistics timeaveraged pulsed spectrum. The best model fit (\u03c72r = 0.7; d.o.f.\n15 - 4) yielded for the soft and hard photon indices \u03931 = 4.09 \u00b1\n0.04 and \u03932 = \u22120.8+0.10\n\u22120.07 , respectively. This is shown as a dashed\naqua curve in Fig. 7, together with the \"deconvolved\" unabsorbed flux values (aqua colored open circles). The power-law\nmodel components become equally strong at 11.46 \u00b1 0.64 keV.\nThe striking spectral hardening of the pulsed emission of 4U\n0142 + 61 around 10 keV is dramatic, much more pronounced\nthan the hardening observed for 1RXS J1708 - 4009.\nThe HEXTE pulsed flux values (Fig. 7; dark-blue open squares)\nare in line with the extrapolation of the PCA hard-power-law\nmodel component.\nThe ASCA GIS 0.8-10 keV pulsed flux values which we derived from the July/August 1999 observations are also shown in\nFig. 7 (filled squares) and are within the systematic/statistical\nuncertainties consistent with the time-averaged PCA fluxes in\nthe overlapping energy range. This suggests a rather stable\npulsed spectrum both in shape and normalization.\n5.2.2. INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI total spectrum\n\n5.2.3. Discussion of spectra and pulsed fractions of 4U\n0142 + 61\nThe INTEGRAL spectrum of the total emission above 20\nkeV can be compared with the same Chandra spectrum for energies below 10 keV (see Fig. 7 the dark orange solid line;\nPatel et al. 2003). As is the case for the pulsed spectra above\nand below \u223c 10 keV, these two spectra are drastically different, and together reveal a sharp minimum in luminosity of 4U\n0142 + 61 around 10 keV.\nIncluding now in this high-energy spectral picture the timeaveraged CGRO COMPTEL 2\u03c3 flux upper limits (red triangles in Fig. 7) from den Hartog et al. (2006) confirms that the\npower-law model statisfactorily describing the 20-300 keV total spectrum will not extend into the MeV range, but must break\nsomewhere between 140 and 750 keV. To investigate this further, we also fitted a spectral model with an energy-dependent\n\u2212(\u0393+\u03b1 ln(E\u03b3 ))\nphoton index, F\u03b3 = K * E\u03b3\n, to the 20-300 keV IBIS ISGRI measurements (see Fig. 7 dashed dotted purple line). The\nmodel extrapolation towards the MeV energy range is consistent with the COMPTEL upper limits, but the improvement of\nthe fit is insufficient to claim a change in spectral shape in the\n20-300 keV window.\nComparing now the total and pulsed high-energy spectra of\n4U 0142 + 61, the Chandra total flux values below 10 keV are\nabout 10 times higher than the time-averaged RXTE PCA and\nASCA GIS pulsed flux measurements. This is consistent with\npulsed fraction estimates of \u223c 10% reported by Patel et al.\n(2003) and G\u00f6hler et al. (2005) using solely Chandra and XMM\nNewton data, respectively. The total spectrum measured by INTEGRAL above 20 keV with slope 1.05 \u00b1 0.11 is significantly\nsofter than the pulsed spectrum measured by RXTE above \u223c\n+0.10\n10 keV with slope \u22120.8\u22120.07\n. As a result, the pulsed fraction\nappears to vary with energy from \u223c 10% at 20 keV to \u223c 100%\nbetween 80 and 100 keV.\n6. 1E 2259 + 586\n\nNear the center of SNR CTB 109 (G 109.1-1.0) a strong compact X-ray source was found by Gregory & Fahlman (1980),\nBe X-ray binary RX J0146.9+6121 at only 24\u2032 from 4U 0142 + 61 was detected, fully resolved, only in the first three energy bands.\n\n5\n\n\fDetection of hard soft \u03b3-ray emission from AXPs\nlater dubbed 1E 2259 + 586, which appeared to be an X-ray\npulsar with a period of 3.489(2) s (Fahlman & Gregory 1981).\nAnalyzing more IPC data, this period turned out to coincide\nwith the first harmonic of a fundamental 6.978 s period (Fahlman\n& Gregory 1983).\nNo radio enhancement at the position of the X-ray pulsar\ncould be identified down to a level of 0.5 mJy (WSRT, 21 cm;\nHughes et al. 1984), 0.2 mJy (VLA, 20 cm; Gregory et al. 1983)\nand even 50\u03bcJy (VLA, 20cm; Coe et al. 1994; Kaspi et al.\n2003). On the other hand, the lack of a bright visual counterpart\n(V \u2265 21) ruled out a supergiant or massive main-sequence star\nassociation (Fahlman & Gregory 1981).\nFurther X-ray observations of 1E 2259 + 586 in the eighties\nwith Tenma (Astro-B), EXOSAT and Ginga (Astro-C) (see e.g.\nKoyama et al. 1987; Morini et al. 1988; Hanson et al. 1988;\nKoyama et al. 1989; Iwasawa et al. 1992) revealed a steady\nspin-down, too slow to power the observed X-ray luminosity,\nand a very soft spectrum. X-ray flux measurements from two\ndifferent Ginga observations spread \u223c 8 months apart indicated\nconsiderable flux variations, accompanied with clear pulse morphology changes and probably a decrease in spin-down rate\n(Iwasawa et al. 1992). The X-ray picture was refined considerably in the nineties using data from BBXRT, ASCA (Astro-D),\nROSAT, BeppoSAX and RXTE. Corbet et al. (1995) showed\nfor the first time that a two-component spectral model - blackbody plus power-law - could fit the ASCA and BBXRT spectral data satisfactorily without invoking spectral (line) features.\nThis finding was confirmed by Rho & Petre (1997) analyzing\nROSAT PSPC, ASCA and BBXRT data simultaneously, and by\nParmar et al. (1998) analyzing BeppoSAX LECS and MECS\ndata. RXTE timing measurements (Mereghetti et al. 1998) further tied down earlier limits on the projected semi-axis to 0.03\nlts, leaving room only for a white dwarf companion, heliumburning star with mass smaller than 0.8 M\u2299 or a main-sequence\nstar viewed under very small inclination angles.\nKaspi et al. (1999) obtained for the first time a phase coherent timing solution for 1E 2259 + 586, indicating great stability (rms 0.01 cycles) over the 2.6 year timespan (29-Sept1996 \u2013 12-May-1999) of their RXTE monitoring observations.\nThis stability makes binary accretion scenarios very unlikely\nand favours a magnetar interpretation. Additional RXTE monitoring data showed that this rotational stability was maintained\nthroughout an extended 4.5 yr period, although the inclusion of\n\u03bd\u0308 was required in the timing model (Gavriil & Kaspi 2002).\nThese authors also found that the pulse morphology did not\nchange significantly with time (cf. Iwasawa et al. 1992, who\nclaimed changes in morphology with time). Moreover, there\nwas no evidence for large variability in the pulsed flux in line\nwith earlier work by Baykal et al. (2000) using RXTE data, but\nin contrast with the Ginga findings (Iwasawa et al. 1992). Furthermore, Gavriil & Kaspi (2002) showed, convincingly for the\nfirst time, that the pulse profile morphology of 1E 2259 + 586\nchanges with energy (cf. Hanson et al. 1988, for earlier indications).\nObservations with the Chandra X-ray observatory in January\n2000 provided an X-ray position with subarcsecond accuracy\n(Hulleman et al. 2001; Patel et al. 2001). In the 0.\u2032\u2032 6 error circle\n(99%) a very faint (Ks = 21.7 \u00b1 0.2 mag) near-infrared counterpart was identified (Hulleman et al. 2001), excluding models in\nwhich the source is powered by disk accretion. The total X-ray\n(0.5-7.0 keV) spectrum of 1E 2259 + 586 appeared featureless\nand could best be described by a combination of a black body\n\n11\n\nkT = 0.412(6) keV plus power-law \u0393 = 3.6(1) absorbed by a Hydrogen column NH = (9.3 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (Patel et al. 2001).\nIn June 2002 RXTE observed an outburst of 1E 2259 + 586\nduring which both the pulsed and persistent X-ray emission increased by more than an order of magnitude relative to their\nquiescent levels (Kaspi et al. 2003). During the course of the\nobservation a spectral softening occured, and a significant pulse\nprofile change was observed. In the meantime the pulsar underwent a sudden spin-up (glitch) followed by a large increase in\nspin-down rate lasting for more than 18 days. Furthermore, 80\nX-ray bursts were detected during the 14.4 ks RXTE observation with durations ranging from 2 ms to 3 s. The outburst properties of 1E 2259 + 586 share strong similarities with SGR outburst characteristics unifying thereby conclusively AXPs and\nSGRs and supporting strongly a magnetar interpretation. More\ndetailed information on the burst characteristics can be found\nin Gavriil et al. (2004). Woods et al. (2004) presented a comparison of the X-ray emission characteristics of 1E 2259 + 586\nbefore, during and after the June 2002 outburst using data from\nXMM-Newton and RXTE. They quantified the changes of the\ntemporal and spectral properties and derived recovery timescales.\nThe X-ray flux increase and subsequent decay can be described\nby two distinct components: one component linked to the burst\nactivity with a timescale of \u223c 2 days and a second component\nwhich decays over the course of the year according to a powerlaw in time (F \u221d t \u03b1 ) with index \u03b1 = \u22120.22 \u00b1 0.01. The latter component behaves similarly in time as the observed nearinfrared flux decay (Tam et al. 2004) and thus these seem to\nbe linked to a common physical mechanism likely acting in the\npulsar's magnetosphere.\nIn this work we derived for the first time the time-averaged\ntiming/spectral properties of 1E 2259 + 586 for energies above\n\u223c 8 keV using archival RXTE PCA/HEXTE data and we compared the pulsed spectrum with the upper limits from IBIS ISGRI and COMPTEL (den Hartog et al. 2006).\n6.1. 1E 2259 + 586 timing characteristics\nThe time-averaged RXTE PCA/HEXTE pulse profiles combining all observations of 1E 2259 + 586 listed in Table 1, except the 14.4 ks period of outburst in 2002, are shown in Fig. 8\nfor energies between 2.2 and 27 keV. In the folding/correlation\nprocess (see Sect. 3.1) we used the ephemeris given by Gavriil\n& Kaspi (2002). The screened PCU-2 exposure amounts \u223c\n747 ks, while the corresponding dead-time corrected on-source\nHEXTE exposures are 256.4 and 267.7 ks for cluster-0 and 1,\nrespectively. For the first time significant deviations from uni2\nformity are visible at energies >\n\u223c 8 keV: Z2 is 10.6\u03c3, 5.2\u03c3 and\n3.1\u03c3 for the PCA 8.3-11.9, 11.9-16.3 and 16.3-24 keV bands,\nrespectively (Fig. 8 panels c-e). The HEXTE sensitivity is still\ntoo low to detect the underlying pulsed emission above \u223c 15\nkeV (Fig. 8 panel f).\nThe morphology of the double-peaked pulse profile changes\ngradually moving up in energy from 2.2 to 24 keV: the dominant pulse near phase 0.7 in Fig. 8 at energies below \u223c 4 keV\nloses significance with respect to the second pulse near phase\n0.25. The latter dominates at energies above \u223c 8 keV. Also note\nthe existence of a narrow pulse-like feature in the deepest minimum near phase 0.45, most striking in panel b (4-8.3 keV) of\nFig. 8. The latter feature is also clearly visible in Fig. 7c of\nGavriil & Kaspi (2002).\nMore quantitative information on the energy dependency of\nthe pulse morphology can be obtained through a decomposition of the pulse profiles in Fourier components.

The black-body plus power-law model fit\nto this spectrum (Patel et al. 2001) is shown in Fig. 10 (darkorange solid line). The double-power-law spectral fit suggests\nthat again a minimum in luminosity is reached around 20 keV,\nwhere the extrapolation of the Chandra model fit crosses the\npulsed PCA spectrum. Given the hard pulsed component suggested in these PCA data up to \u223c 24 keV, we estimate that the\nsource will show up at higher energies in an IBIS ISGRI mosaic totalling >\n\u223c 4 Ms in effective on-axis exposure, what will\nbe reached when adding in follow-up work already performed\nand/or scheduled observations. To complete the high-energy\npicture, the COMPTEL 0.75-30 MeV upper limits to the total\nemission (den Hartog et al. 2006) are also included in Fig. 10.\nComparing in the overlapping energy range below 10 keV the\nPCA time-averaged pulsed fluxes with the Chandra total emission model, and assuming no time variability, indicates a rather\nhigh value of >\n\u223c 43% for the pulsed fraction (pulsed/total emission), in agreement with earlier estimates (Patel et al. 2001).\n\n13\n\n(Mereghetti 1995; Corbet & Mihara 1997) indicated that the\nspin-down rate almost doubled after 1988, likely anticorrelated\nwith the X-ray flux.\nBeppoSAX LECS / MECS data from long exposures in May\n1997 indicated the necessity of a two component spectral model,\na power-law plus black body, to describe properly the measured\nX-ray (0.5-10 keV) spectrum (Oosterbroek et al. 1998). This\nwas confirmed by Paul et al. (2000) using ASCA data. In the\nmeantime, detailed timing studies using RXTE monitoring observations performed in 1997-2000 (Kaspi et al. 2001) showed\nthat significant deviations from simple spin-down exist, making\nphase-coherent timing impossible over time stretches longer\nthan a few months. Inspite of these rotational irregularities, neither pulse profile changes nor large pulsed flux variations were\nfound. 1E 1048.1 - 5937 exhibited three X-ray bursts, on 2001\nOct. 29, 2001 Nov. 14, and 2004 June 29, all caught during\nRXTE monitoring observations (Gavriil et al. 2002b, 2006).\nPrecise X-ray imaging of 1E 1048.1 - 5937 with Chandra\n(Wang & Chakrabarty 2002; Israel et al. 2002) provided a source\nposition with sub-arcsecond accuracy. Within the 0.\u2032\u2032 7 error\ncircle only one faint near-IR source was found which clearly\nshowed variability. A detailed variability study in the infrared\nand optical was undertaken by Durant & van Kerkwijk (2005).\nThey established the variable nature in the infrared and optical\nand found a possible anticorrelation with the X-ray pulsed flux\n(see Gavriil & Kaspi 2004, for an extensive study of the X-ray\npulsed flux variability and spin-down rate variations).

Phase-resolved spectroscopy\nclearly indicated that the spectrum is softer at pulse minimum\nand harder at pulse maximum with respect to the phase averaged spectrum.\nIn the next section we present for the first time the hard Xray/soft \u03b3-ray timing and spectral characteristics of 1E 1048.1 5937 above \u223c 8 keV using a) all available public RXTE PCA\nand HEXTE data (see Table 1), b) INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI\ndata (see Table 2) and c) CGRO COMPTEL 0.75-30 MeV data.\n7.1. 1E 1048.1 - 5937 timing characteristics\nIn the timing analysis of the full set of PCA observations of\n1E 1048.1 - 5937 listed in Table 1 according to the guidelines\ngiven in Sect. 3.1, we produced time-averaged pulse-phase distributions for energies between \u223c 2 and 35 keV. In the folding/correlation process (see Sect. 3.1) we used the ephemerides\ngiven by Kaspi et al. (2001). Significant pulsed emission has\nbeen detected up to \u223c 12 keV. The PCA pulse profiles of 1E\n1048.1 - 5937 are shown in Fig. 11 for the three following\ndifferential energy bands, 2.2-4.0, 4.0-7.9 and 7.9-11.9 keV.\nThe detection of pulsed emission, with a non-uniformity significance of 6.8\u03c3, between \u223c 7.9 and 11.9 keV is reported for\nthe first time. The single peaked pulse profiles, with a slightly\nsteeper rise than fall, do not show morphology changes as a\nfunction of energy. HEXTE data do not show pulsed emission\nat energies above \u223c 15 keV.\n7.2. 1E 1048.1 - 5937 spectral characteristics\n7.2.1. RXTE PCA/HEXTE pulsed spectrum\nThe derived pulsed excess counts have been converted to flux\nvalues assuming an absorbing column density of NH = 1.0 \u00d7\n1022 cm\u22122 (see Tiengo et al. 2005). It turned out that a single\npower-law model for the PCA band did not give an acceptable\nfit. Therefore we used for this AXP a black body plus powerlaw input spectrum. The optimized model (\u03c72r = 0.55 for 16 - 4\nd.o.f.; kT = 0.717(4) keV and \u0393 = 2.93(7)) is shown in Fig. 12\ntogether with the flux measurements, both aqua colored. It is interesting to note, that, while the photon index is in the expected\nrange (Tiengo et al. 2005), the (time-averaged) black body temperature of the pulsed component is slightly higher than the values obtained from the other X-ray instruments. This is very\nlikely caused by the lack of sensitivity of the PCA for energies\nless than \u223c 2.5 keV, thus poorly constraining the black body\nmodel at energies below its maximum. For HEXTE we could\nonly derive upper limits for the pulsed emission, also shown in\nFig. 12 as blue symbols.\n\nF IG . 12.- A \u03bdF\u03bd representation of the spectrum of 1E 1048.1 - 5937.\nAbove \u223c 12 keV the source is too weak to be detected so far. The IBIS ISGRI\n(purple) and CGRO COMPTEL (red) 2\u03c3 upper-limits are for the total emission. Below 10 keV we also added spectral information for the pulsed (dotted)\nand total (solid) emission from two XMM Newton observations performed at\ndifferent epochs (Tiengo et al. 2005), illustrating the variable nature both in\nnormalization and shape of both components.\n\n7.2.2. INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI and CGRO COMPTEL total\nspectrum\nIBIS ISGRI data (Core program \u2013 GPS or public) from observations executed between revolution 30 and 217, satisfying\nour off-source pointing constraint of 14.\u25e6 5 have been used to obtain spectral information on the total emission from 1E 1048.1 5937 in the 20 \u2013 300 keV energy range. The effective on-axis\nexposure time is, however, small \u223c 250.8 ks, resulting in rather\nhigh upper-limits given the non-detections in any of the chosen\nbroad energy bands. These 2\u03c3 upper-limits have been included\nin Fig.12 as purple symbols. Also, the analysis of full mission COMPTEL data (4.8 Ms exposure in total) did not result\nin significant detections of 1E 1048.1 - 5937. The 2\u03c3 COMPTEL upper-limits are shown as red symbols in Fig.12. It is clear\nfrom the full high-energy spectral picture presented in Fig. 12\nthat current spectral information above \u223c 10 keV does not exclude the presence of a hard spectral component. Additional\nIBIS ISGRI data e.g. from a deep 2 Ms observation of the Carina region, performed between INTEGRAL revolutions 192\nand 203, with 1E 1048.1 - 5937 always in the FCFOV, will be\nvery usefull to constrain the spectral properties of 1E 1048.1 5937 further in a future study.\n8. 1E 1841-045\n\n1E 1841-045 is the first AXP for which surprisingly nonthermal pulsed X-ray/soft \u03b3-ray emission was discovered (Kuiper\net al. 2004); see this paper also for a summary of earlier observational results on 1E 1841-045). The pulsed spectrum above\n10 keV could be described, fitting RXTE PCA and HEXTE\ndata, by a power-law model with photon index 0.94 \u00b1 0.16 up\nto \u223c 150 keV. The total spectrum of 1E 1841-045 presented\nin Kuiper et al. (2004) was derived from HEXTE data using\nsource ON/OFF rocking-mode observations. We realized later\n\n\fDetection of hard soft \u03b3-ray emission from AXPs\n\nF IG . 13.- RXTE PCA pulse profiles of 1E 1841-045 for the 2.1-10.3 and\n10.3-20.1 keV energy ranges (panels a and b, respectively), compared with the\nIBIS ISGRI 20-100 keV pulse profile (panel c). The dotted lines at phases 0.7\nand 1.05 serve as a guide to the eye for alignment comparison purposes.

Better spectral information can be obtained with\nan imaging instrument like INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI. Preliminary total flux measurements with ISGRI were so far only reported by Molkov et al. (2004). For the present work significantly more ISGRI data are available. Therefore, we present\nin this section a) a new spectrum of the total emission and b)\nperformed now also a timing analysis for 1E 1841-045 using\nISGRI data. Furthermore, c) we repeated the timing/spectral\nRXTE PCA analysis using additional data compared to Kuiper\net al. (2004) as well as improved event selection criteria (see\nSect. 3.1). Finally, d) also for this source we analyzed COMPTEL skymaps.\n8.1. 1E 1841-045 pulse profiles for RXTE PCA and\nINTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI\nIn our RXTE reanalysis for 1E 1841-045, data from observation 80098 (spread over 28-3-2003 \u2013 17-2-2004; screened PCU2 exposure \u223c 69.1 ks) were added to the set used in Kuiper et\nal. (2004) (now, total screened PCU-2 exposure: \u223c 340.2 ks).\nWe used in the folding/correlation process (see Sect. 3.1) the\nephemerides given by Gotthelf et al. (2002) and derived in this\nwork (see Table 3). The results are pulse profiles with improved\nstatistics, confirming the variation of pulse shape with energy\nas presented by (Kuiper et al. 2004).

The total screened effective on-axis exposure was \u223c 808.8 ks. We\nderived a very accurate (RMS residual is 0.015 in phase; see\nTable 3 for the details) phase coherent ephemeris using RXTE\nPCA monitoring observations performed during March - December 2003. This has been applied in the folding process of\nthe selected barycentered ISGRI events. For the 20-100 keV\nenergy range we obtained a Z22 of 3.6\u03c3. This ISGRI pulse profile is also shown in Fig. 13 (panel c). Its shape mimics that of\nthe PCA 10.3-20.1 keV profile suggesting a stable pulse shape\nin the hard X-ray window. The statistics are still low, however,\nbut additional ISGRI data from already performed and future\nscheduled observations will allow more detailed studies of the\npulse shape in this energy range.\n8.2. 1E 1841-045 spectral characteristics\n8.2.1. RXTE and INTEGRAL pulsed emission\nStarting with the new RXTE PCA phase distributions, introduced above, the updated 1E 1841-045 pulsed spectrum, now\nwith significant flux values up to \u223c 28 keV, is shown in Fig. 14\nusing aqua colored symbols. Also given are the earlier-reported\npulsed-flux values from HEXTE (dark blue data points; see\nKuiper et al. 2004), which clearly revealed the hard pulsed component up to \u223c 150 keV.\n\n\f16\n\nKuiper et al.\n\nNow we can also derive information on the pulsed spectrum\nfrom IBIS ISGRI. Phase distributions have been generated, followed by extraction of pulsed counts, for three logarithmically\nspaced energy bands (20-50, 50-120 and 120-300 keV), yielding only for the 50-120 keV band a significant pulsed-flux measurement. This ISGRI pulsed-flux value and two upper limits,\nshown in Fig. 14 as magenta symbols, are fully consistent with\nthe hard spectrum measured by HEXTE. We fitted the new PCA\npulsed spectrum for energies above \u223c 15 keV together with the\nHEXTE and INTEGRAL pulsed flux data points with a simple power-law model, yielding as best fit a photon index \u0393 of\n0.72 \u00b1 0.15, slightly harder than derived by Kuiper et al. (2004).\nThis best fit model is indicated as a dashed black line in Fig. 14.\n8.2.2. INTEGRAL total emission\nIn this work we derived the total emission spectrum of 1E\n1841-045 in the 20-300 keV energy range from IBIS ISGRI\nmosaic maps generated for 7 differential energy bands over\nthe 20 - 300 keV band, thus significantly improving upon the\nspectral information given by Molkov et al. (2004). We used a\ncombination of public and Core program observations, all with\nsource off-pointing angles less than 14.\u25e65, and for which the details6 are listed in Table 2. The total screened effective on-axis\nexposure on 1E 1841-045 in this combination was \u223c 1, 111 Ms.\nSignificant emission has been detected up to \u223c 140 keV (95140 keV; 5.7 \u00b1 0.9 mCrab). The derived flux values are shown\nin Fig. 14 as purple colored symbols. Over this 20-300 keV\nband we can not discriminate between a power-law or powerlaw model with energy dependent index to be the best model describing the measurements. However, including in Fig. 14 the\nCGRO COMPTEL flux upper limits (red symbols) derived in\nthis work, we notice that the best fitting power-law model with\nphoton index \u0393 = 1.32 \u00b1 0.11 does not extend into the MeV domain. The spectrum must break somewhere between 140 and\n750 keV. The curved power-law model is consistent with the\nCOMPTEL 2\u03c3 upper limits. Both models are shown in Fig. 14\nas purple dashed (power-law) and purple dashed-dotted (curved\npower-law) lines with the latter model extrapolated up to 750\nkeV.\n8.2.3. Discussion of spectra and pulsed fractions of 1E\n1841-045\nThe new and better total spectrum of 1E 1841-045, now derived using ISGRI data, is indeed lower, \u223c 40 % between 20\nand 100 keV, than published earlier using HEXTE data (Kuiper\net al. 2004), and is also slightly harder. It connects better to\nthe total spectra measured at different epochs by XMM Newton and Chandra ACIS below 10 keV, shown in Fig. 14 and\nadopted from Kuiper et al. (2004, and citations therein).\nFor the pulsed spectrum, the power-law fit to the new PCA\nspectrum above \u223c 15 keV combined with the new ISGRI measurements and the earlier published HEXTE flux values, confirms the drastic up turn/hardening of the pulsed spectrum. Also,\nthe extrapolation of this very hard spectrum has to remain under our COMPTEL upper limits, requiring an even more drastic\nbend/break compared to what is required for the total spectrum.\nThe compilation of Chandra, XMM-Newton, RXTE and INTEGRAL spectra in Fig. 14, taken at very different epochs\nover many years, suggests that the hard X-ray emission of 1E\n6 Data from Revs. 131,133-134 were ignored because these have been taken\nin a staring mode configuration giving rise to substantial systematical effects in\nthe image deconvolution procedures.\n\n1841-045 is stable, i.e. this magnetar is most of the time in the\nsame state of activity for energies above \u223c 10 keV. The pulsed\nfraction is confirmed to be \u223c 25% at 20 keV and \u223c 100% for\nenergies beyond \u223c 100 keV.\n9. SUMMARY\n\nExploiting the availability of archival data from RXTE monitoring observations and new, deep INTEGRAL exposures of\nAXPs, we were able to show that AXPs exhibit exceptionally\nhard spectra for energies above 10 keV. Of the sample of five\nAXPs studied in this work, three (the brightest at energies below 10 keV: 1E 1841-045, 1RXS J1708 - 4009, 4U 0142 + 61)\nare shown to emit up to energies of \u223c 150 keV. Of the two\nweaker sources, for one (1E 2259 + 586) an upturn of pulsed\nemission is suggested up to \u223c 25 keV, and the other (1E 1048.1 5937) is too weak to detect a possible similar upturn in the hardX-ray range with presently available exposures. We regard this\nsufficient evidence to conclude that a persistent non-thermal\ncomponent at energies above 10 keV is a common property of\nAXPs.\nIn Table 4 we summarize for the five AXPs the spectral parameters presented in this work, together with estimates for\ntheir distances and pulsar characteristics (period, period derivative, deduced surface magnetic field strength at the pole and\nspin-down power). Most interesting and new are the results on\nthe total and pulsed spectra, and luminosities above 10 keV. As\nnoted above, the exceptionally hard pulsed spectra seem to extend up to at least 150 keV, therefore we have given for all four\nAXPs for which the spectral up turn around 10 keV has been\nmeasured, the luminosity of the pulsed component integrating\nthe best-fit power-law model over the full decade in energy from\n10 to 100 keV. For the luminosity of the pulsed component between 1 and 10 keV, we list the power in the power-law component fitted to the pulsed spectra before the break, except for\n1E 1048.1 - 5937, where the power has been derived from a\nblack body plus power-law model. Thus for 4 AXPs we ignore the presence of a black-body component which is known\nto be present at lower energies as well. However, for 1RXS\nJ1708 - 4009, 4U 0142 + 61, 1E 2259 + 586 and 1E 1841-045\nwe could fit the pulsed PCA spectra down to about 2 keV well\nwith a single power-law model.\nThe total spectra above 20 keV appear also to be hard, but\nsomewhat softer than the pulsed spectra.\nFor 1E 1841-045 and 4U 0142 + 61 the total emission becomes consistent with 100% pulsed around \u223c 100 keV, starting\nfrom a pulsed fraction at 10 keV of \u223c 25% and \u223c 10% for\n1E 1841-045 and 4U 0142 + 61, respectively. The exception is\n1RXS J1708 - 4009, for which the hard X-ray emission above\n10 keV is consistent with being 100% pulsed. Note in this context, however, the strong intensity variability reported for this\nAXP for energies below 10 keV, which might be coupled to\nvariations in pulsed fraction.\nTable 4 immediately shows that the luminosities of the hard\nX-ray components (pulsed and total) exceed the available total\nspin-down powers by a few orders of magnitude, a conclusion\ndrawn earlier for the total luminosities (black body plus powerlaw components) in the 1 \u2013 10 keV band.\nOur compilations of total and pulsed flux values for energies\nabove 10 keV for the three strongest AXPs, using data from\ndifferent instruments and collected at different epochs, suggest\nthat the high-energy component is stable, contrary to reports for\nthe emissions below 10 keV.

Phase-resolved spectroscopy on time-averaged profiles will be performed when more INTEGRAL data can be\nadded.\n10. DISCUSSION\n\nThe discussion of AXPs in the context of magnetically powered rotating neutron stars, was till recently focussed on understanding the observational characteristics of the soft-spectrum\ncomponent for energies below 10 keV. Indeed, evidence for\nhard X-ray or soft gamma-ray emission from AXPs was lacking, in contrast to the very luminous outbursts at soft gammaray energies characterizing SGRs. Our discovery of pulsed\nemission from AXPs up to at least \u223c 150 keV adds a completely\nnew non-thermal component requiring a steady mechanism for\naccelerating particles in magnetospheres of magnetars. Also\nthis new quiescent emission component is far too luminous to\nbe powered by rotational energy loss, as is evident in Table 4.\nRecently, INTEGRAL also found for the first time quiescent\nhard X-ray emission from a SGR (SGR 1806-20; Molkov et al.\n2005; Mereghetti et al. 2005). As for AXPs, its spectrum above\n10 keV could be fitted with a hard power-law model, photon\nindex 1.6 \u00b1 0.1, an index comparable to, but somewhat softer\nthan that measured for the total AXP spectra in that energy window, but significantly softer than the hard spectra reported in\nthis work for the quiescent pulsed spectra of AXPs. In addition, the quiescent SGR spectrum does not exhibit a black body\ncomponent at energies below 10 keV. This underlines again,\nthat AXPs and SGRs are (very) different manifestations of the\nmagnetar scenario.\nIn Table 4, we listed the high-energy characteristics for five\nAXPs studied in this work, out of a total of six persistent AXPs\nknown to date. Although this sample is still very small, we\nverified whether there are already any apparent correlations between the measured parameters. There is a hint for a correlation between the magnetic field strength Bs and the luminosity\np\nL10\u2212100\nof the pulsed emission of the hard tail (10-100 keV) for\nfour AXPs, as well as the total emission of the hard tail (now\nfor three AXPs). However, 1E 1048.1 - 5937 has a Bs three\ntimes higher than 4U 0142 + 61, and is located at a similar distance, but no hard X-ray emission has been detected, and its\nluminosity at \u223c 10 keV is about three times lower than that of\n4U 0142 + 61. It is interesting to note that the spin down lumi-\n\nF IG . 15.- A \u03bdF\u03bd spectral representation of the pulsed emission for the 4\nAXPs showing hard spectral tails. For comparison purposes, also the pulsed\nhigh-energy (\u223c 1 keV - 10 GeV) spectra of the young Crab (PSR B0531+21)\nand PSR B1509-58 pulsars, and the middle-aged Vela pulsar (PSR B0833045) are shown. Furthermore, the 3\u03c3 GLAST sensitivity (green dashed-dotted\nline) assuming an E \u22122 source for an all-sky survey duration of one year (> 100\nMeV) is shown.\n\nnosity of 1E 1048.1 - 5937 is the highest of this sample, mainly\ndue to its large \u1e56, and reaches almost 50% of the luminosity of\nthe pulsed emission between 1 and 10 keV, a factor 10 - 100\nhigher than for the other four AXPs.\nSurprisingly, the high-energy AXP spectra are very similar\nto those of \"middle-aged\" radio pulsars in the \u223c 10\u2013300 keV\nenergy band. This can be seen in Fig. 15 in which the AXP\nspectra are shown together with the spectra of two young radio pulsars, PSR B0531+21 (Crab) and PSR B1509-58, and the\nmiddle-aged Vela pulsar (PSR B0833-45). These are the only\nradio pulsars which have been detected from soft X-rays up to\nthe gamma-ray domain. The other middle-aged high-energy\ngamma-ray pulsars detected by CGRO EGRET (see e.g. the\nreview by Thompson et al. 1997) are detected at high-energy\ngamma-rays (>100 MeV), and soft X-rays, but not in the intermediate hard X-ray range, in which they are weaker than the\nVela pulsar. The overall high-energy spectral shape of these\nmiddle-aged pulsars is expected to be similar to that of Vela.\nLike the AXPs, the Vela pulsar has a (pulsed) thermal blackbody component (only visible below 2 keV, and not shown in\n\n\f18\n\nKuiper et al.\n\nFig.15), and an extrapolation of its power-law shape spectrum\nabove 10 keV to the IR, optical and radio domains is approximately in agreement with the measured flux values at these\nlonger wavelengths. This is rather similar to the case of e.g.\nAXP 4U 0142 + 61, with the difference that none of the AXPs\nhave so far been seen in the radio, and the X-ray and IR emissions exhibit a time variable behaviour, not seen for Vela. This\nsimilarity of the multiwavelengths spectra could suggest some\nsimilarity in production processes in the two different scenarios\nof rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars starting from very\ndifferent sources of power.\nA first attempt, before our discovery of hard X-ray emission\nfrom AXPs, to model possible production of high-energy (Xray and gamma-ray) emission in the magnetospheres of AXPs,\napplying a scenario proposed for high-energy production in the\nmagnetospheres of radio pulsars, was made by Cheng & Zhang\n(2001). They modeled the production of high-energy (above\n100 MeV) gamma-radiation in outer magnetospheric gaps of\nAXPs. They argued that due to the strong field of a magnetar, the gamma-ray emission rooted at the polar caps will be\nquenched. However, far away from the pulsar surface, i.e. in\nouter vacuum gaps, gamma radiation could be emitted because\nthe local field will drop below the critical quantum limit. They\npredict that the NASA Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope\nGLAST, due for launch in 2007, might be able to detect this\nvery-high-energy emission from AXPs (see Fig. 15 for the 3\u03c3\nGLAST sensitivity assuming an E \u22122 source spectrum for an allsky survey duration of one year). However, their model calculations do not reproduce the hard spectra and high X-ray luminosities now discovered above 10 keV.\nThe publication of the discovery of a hard spectral tail of\n1E 1841-045 by Kuiper et al. (2004) stimulated Thompson &\nBeloborodov (2005) to reconsider high-energy emission from\nmagnetars due to an ultra strong magnetic field. A gradual release of energy in the stellar magnetosphere is expected if it is\ntwisted and a strong electric current is induced on the closed\nfield lines. They considered two mechanisms of gamma-ray\nemission:\n(1) A thin surface layer of the star is heated by the downward beam of current carrying charges, which excite Langmuir turbulance in the layer. Thus, a temperature kT of \u223c\n100 keV can be reached, emitting bremsstrahlung photons up\nto this characteristic temperature. Interestingly, three of the\nAXPs, 1RXS J1708 - 4009, 4U 0142 + 61 and 1E 1841-045,\nwere detected up to these energies of \u223c 150 keV, the shapes\nof their total and/or pulsed spectra being consistent with this\nmechanism with peak luminosities around the predicted energy.\nHowever, the 100% pulsed fraction around 20 keV for 1RXS\nJ1708 - 4009 is difficult to reconcile with the surface emission,\ngiven the effects of general relativistic light bending. Future\nobservations have to reveal whether the cut off in the spectra is\nalso consistent with this interpretation.\n(2) Soft \u03b3-rays are produced at a distance of \u223c 100 km from\nthe star surface in the magnetosphere, where the electron cyclotron energy is in the keV range. A large electric field develops in this region in response to the outward drag force felt\nby the current-carrying electrons from the flux of keV photons\nleaving the star. Thompson & Beloborodov show that a seed\nphoton injected in this region undergoes a runaway acceleration and upscatters keV photons above the threshold for pair\ncreation. The resulting synchrotron spectrum can reach a peak\nat \u223c 1 MeV. Our hard-X-ray spectra together with the upper\n\nlimits from COMPTEL in the MeV domain, allow spectra with\nmaximum luminosities close to the MeV range. But we should\nnote that the flux values reported around \u223c 100 keV are already\nat about the same level as the 2-\u03c3 upper limits for the 0.75\u2013\n3 MeV interval, suggesting a different shape, thus challenging\nthis interpretation.\nAn alternative quantum-electrodynamics model for the bursts\nand the quiescent non-thermal emission from AXPs as well as\nSGRs was proposed by Heyl & Hernquist (2005a,b). Their\nmodel is based on fast-mode breakdown, in which wave energy\nis dissipated into electron-positron pairs when the scale of these\ndiscontinuities becomes comparable to an electron Compton\nwavelength. They showed that under appropriate conditions,\nan electron-positron fireball would result, producing primarily\nthe X-ray and soft-gamma-ray bursts. They also investigated\n(Heyl & Hernquist 2005b) the properties of non-thermal emission in the absence of a fire ball. This quiescent, non-thermal\nemission associated with fast-mode breakdown may account\nfor the observed non-thermal emission presented in this work\nfor AXPs, as well as for the quiescent emission reported for\nSGR 1806-20 (Molkov et al. 2005; Mereghetti et al. 2005). Indeed, they succeeded in fitting ISGRI AXP spectra as well as\nunabsorbed optical data for 4U 0142 + 61 from Hulleman et al.\n(2000), and the SGR 1806-20 non-thermal spectrum above 10\nkeV. Interestingly, they predict that the emission should extend\nbeyond the observed INTEGRAL spectra without a break below 1 MeV. However, the combination of ISGRI spectra and\nCOMPTEL upper limits presented in this work, seem to contradict this claim. They further state, that if the magnetars have\nsignificant optical excesses, such as 4U 0142 + 61, then the quiescent emission from most of the AXPs discussed in this work\nand of SGR 1806-20 should be detectable with GLAST (see\nagain Fig. 15 for the GLAST sensitivity). Further INTEGRAL\nobservations, and ultimately GLAST observations can support\nor reject these claims.\nOver the last few years, two radio pulsars with periods and\nperiod time derivatives similar to those found for AXPs, thus\nalso with high-magnetic-field strengths, are found: PSR J18470130, which has the highest by far inferred surface dipolar magnetic field (B = 9.4 \u00d7 1013 G) among all known radio pulsars\n(McLaughlin et al. 2003) and PSR J1718-3718 (Hobbs et al.\n2004; Kaspi & McLaughlin 2005). The X-ray luminosities (or\nupper-limits to these) in the 2-10 keV range derived for these\ntwo radio pulsars are much lower than those of the standard\nAXP group. Above 10 keV, detection of hard X-rays could\nconnect these two different types of neutron stars. PSR J18470130 and PSR J1718-3718 both happened to be located near\nthe centers of our deep IBIS ISGRI exposures on 1E 1841-045\nand 1RXS J1708 - 4009, respectively. Therefore, we searched\nabove 20 keV for hard X-ray signatures from these pulsars, but\nnothing was detected in any of the energy bands we have investigated. The 2\u03c3 upper limit on the flux in the 20-30 keV band\nfor PSR J1847-0130 is 0.4 mCrab7 and that for PSR J17183718 is also 0.4 mCrab, but now in the 20-35 keV band.\nTherefore, why solitary rotating neutron stars with AXP-like\ntiming parameters in some cases behave as ''dull\" radio pulsars\nand in other cases as ''enigmatic\" magnetars is still unclear.\nDifferent suggestions have been made (see e.g. McLaughlin et\nal. 2003), one of the possibilities being that high-field pulsars\nand AXPs have similar dipole magnetic fields, but AXPs have\nalso quadrupole (or higher) components. Kaspi & McLaughlin\n7\n\n1E 1841-045 is detected in the same image with a flux of \u223c 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 mCrab\n\n\fDetection of hard soft \u03b3-ray emission from AXPs\n(2005) suggest a.o. the interesting possibility that the high-field\nradio pulsars, may one day emit transient magnetar-like emission, and conversely that the transient AXPs might be more\nlikely to exhibit radio pulsations. More theoretical work is required, but certainly also more detailed observational results at\nall wavelengths to verify the model predictions. Ongoing observations of AXPs with the wide-field-of-view INTEGRAL IBIS\nimager will allow us to contribute with deeper studies in the\nhard X-ray/soft \u03b3-ray range.\n\n19\n\nIsrael, G.L., Mereghetti, S. and Stella, L. 1994, ApJ, 433, L25\nIsrael, G.L., Covino, S., Stella, L., et al. 1999, ApJ, 518, L107\nIsrael, G.L., Oosterbroek, T., Angelini, L. 1999, A&A, 346, 929\nIsrael, G.L., Oosterbroek, T., Stella, L. 2001, ApJ, 560, L65\nIsrael, G.L., Covino, S., Stella, L. 2002, ApJ, 580, L143\nIsrael, G.L., Covino, S., Perna, R. 2003, ApJ, 589, L93\nIwasawa, K, Koyama, K., and Halpern, J.P. 1992, PASJ, 44, 9\nJahoda, K., Swank, J.H., Giles, A.B., et al. 1996, Proc.
