Kartashov and Lluis Torner\nICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Mediterranean Technology Park, and Universitat\nPolitecnica de Catalunya, 08860 Castelldefels (Barcelona), Spain\nWe study gray solitons in nonlocal nonlinear media and show that they are stable and\ncan form bound states. We reveal that gray soliton velocity depends on the nonlocality\ndegree, and that it can be drastically reduced in highly nonlocal media. This is in\ncontrast to the case of local media, where the maximal velocity is dictated solely by the\nasymptotic soliton amplitude.\nOCIS codes: 190.5530, 190.4360, 060.1810\nNonlocality is ubiquitous in several nonlinear optical materials, such as nematic\nliquid crystals, thermo-optical materials, plasmas, and photorefractive crystals. It has\nbeen shown to profoundly affect beam interactions [1]. Thus, interaction between onedimensional bright solitons in nonlocal media depends on spatial separation [2,3] so that\nbound states of bright solitons may form [4-6]. Nonlocal materials sustain complex twodimensional solitons [7-16], while dark solitons may exist in defocusing nonlocal media.\nStrongly nonlocal response can cause attraction between two dark solitons [17,18] which\nalways repel each other in local medium. A characteristic signature of dark solitons in\nnonlocal media is the presence of non-monotonic tails affording the formation of bound\nstates [17].\nDark solitons, however, are a particular type of gray solitons having antisymmetric\nphase profiles, but with a smaller and more gradual phase shift [19]. Gray solitons move\nin the transverse plane upon propagation, with a grayness that depends on the soliton\nvelocity. In this Letter we introduce properties of gray solitons in nonlocal nonlinear\nmedia. We show that nonlocal gray solitons are stable and can form bound states. We\ndiscover that nonlocality imposes drastic restrictions on gray soliton velocity.\n\n1\n\n\fOur theoretical model is based on two coupled equations for the light field\namplitude q and nonlinear contribution to refractive index n describing the propagation\nof laser beam along the \u03be axis of a nonlocal defocusing medium:\n\ni\n\n\u2202q\n1 \u22022q\n=\u2212\n\u2212 qn,\n\u2202\u03be\n2 \u2202\u03b7 2\n\n\u22022n\nd 2 \u2212n = q 2,\n\u2202\u03b7\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b7 and \u03be stand for the transverse and longitudinal coordinates scaled to the\ncharacteristic width of the dark notch of the soliton profile and to the diffraction length,\nrespectively. When nonlocality parameter d \u2192 0 one recovers the local case, while\nd \u2192 \u221e corresponds to a strong nonlocality. The nonlinear contribution to refractive\nindex is given by n = \u2212\u222b\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nG (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03bb) q(\u03bb, \u03be ) 2 d\u03bb , where G (\u03b7) = (1/ 2d 1/ 2 )exp(\u2212 \u03b7 / d 1/ 2 )\n\nis the response function of the nonlocal medium. Defocusing nonlocal nonlinearities that\nallow formation of dark and gray solitons are encountered in various physical systems,\nincluding atomic vapors, weakly absorbing liquids [18], and liquid crystals featuring a\nthermal response [20]. While the details of the response function may be different in each\ncase, the model (1) is expected to capture the general physics of nonlocal gray solitons.\nNote that Eq. (1) can be simplified in the limiting cases of strong and weak nonlocality.\nThus, at d \u2192 0 the equation for n can be solved at the first order of perturbation\ntheory to give n = \u2212(1 + d \u22022 / \u2202\u03b7 2 ) q 2 , a result that allows obtaining corrections to the\nparameters of local gray solitons in analytic form [19]. At d \u2192 \u221e one can use the fact\nthat the response function width is much larger than the dark soliton notch width to\nsimplify the expression for n and to obtain a simple equation for q by using expansions\nfor G (\u03b7) function.\nWe searched for gray solitons of Eqs. (1) numerically in the moving coordinate\nframe \u03b6 = \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b1\u03be , with the form q(\u03b6 , \u03be ) = [u(\u03b6 ) + iv(\u03b6 )]exp(ib\u03be ) , where u and v are the\nreal and imaginary field amplitudes, and b is the propagation constant. In the case of\nsingle solitons we assume that u(\u2212\u03b6 ) = \u2212u(\u03b6 ) and v(\u2212\u03b6 ) = v(\u03b6 ) . At d = 0 Eqs. (1) have\nthe analytical solution u = (\u2212b \u2212 \u03b12 )1/ 2 tanh[(\u2212b \u2212 \u03b12 )1/ 2 \u03b6 ] , and v = \u03b1 , that describes a\ngray soliton moving with velocity \u03b1 , with \u03b12 < \u2212b . The propagation constant b\n\n2\n\n\fdictates the asymptotic values of soliton intensity q(\u03b7 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, \u03be ) 2 = \u2212b and refractive\nindex n(\u03b7 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e) = b , while the velocity \u03b1 sets the soliton grayness, defined as\ng = min q\n\n2\n\n= \u03b12 . We analyze the impact of soliton velocity \u03b1 and nonlocality degree\n\nd on the properties of solitons with equal asymptotic intensities at \u03b7 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and\ninitially set b = \u22121 (see below for other values). It is useful to introduce the rescaled\nenergy flow U r and momentum Pr :\nUr =\n\n\u221e\n\n\u222b\u2212\u221e \u2212b \u2212 q\n\n2\n\nd \u03b7,\n(2)\n\n\u2202q \u239f\u239e\ni \u221e \u239b \u2202q \u2217\nb\n1 + 2 d \u03b7.\n\u2212 q\u2217\nPr = \u222b \u239c\u239cq\n\u239f\n\u239f\n\u2202\u03b7 \u23a0\n2 \u2212\u221e \u239d \u2202\u03b7\nq\n\nThe nonlocality drastically affects gray soliton properties. Representative examples of\nintensity profiles w = u 2 + v 2 of single gray solitons are depicted in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b).\nThe asymptotic intensity and refractive indices for nonlocal gray solitons at \u03b7 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e\ncoincide with those in local media. The soliton grayness g = min q\n\n2\n\n(minimal intensity\n\nvalue) monotonically increases with \u03b1 , but in contrast to gray solitons in local media\nthat feature smooth shapes, rapidly moving nonlocal gray solitons develop multiple\nintensity oscillations around the main intensity deep (Fig. 1(b)). These oscillations\nbecome more pronounced for high nonlocality degrees. They exist even at \u03b1 \u2192 0 , though\nthe number of oscillations increases while their amplitude decreases with \u03b1 . The\ntransverse phase distributions (Fig. 2) confirm that solitons from Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)\ncorrespond to single gray solitons. The development of shape oscillations is accompanied\nby divergence of U r which turns out to be a nonmonotonic function of \u03b1 (Fig. 3(a)), in\ncontrast to the case of local media where energy U r = 2(\u2212b \u2212 \u03b12 )1/ 2 monotonically\ndecreases with \u03b1 and vanishes at \u03b1 \u2192 \u2212b = 1 . At \u03b1 = 0 and d > 0 the rescaled\nenergy U r exceeds the value 2(\u2212b)1/ 2 of energy in local media because nonlocality\ngenerates oscillations even on dark solitons.\nThere is a maximal soliton velocity, \u03b1m , at which the gray soliton vanishes\ncompletely, since g(\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1m ) = 1 . The maximal soliton velocity in nonlocal media is\nlower than that in local media (Fig. 3(b)). Therefore, nonlocality of nonlinear response\nstrongly affects the mobility of gray solitons. Figure 4(a) show how the maximal soliton\nvelocity decreases with d . The soliton grayness is a monotonically increasing function of\n\n3\n\n\fthe nonlocality degree for a fixed velocity \u03b1 , and it tends to unity when d approaches a\ncertain limiting value (Fig. 4(b)). Notice that in contrast to U r , the rescaled momentum\nPr is a monotonically increasing function of \u03b1 , which in accordance with stability\ntheory for gray solitons [19] might be considered as an indication of soliton stability.\nWe found that solitons exhibit qualitatively similar properties for all values of b ,\ni.e. for each b there exist maximal velocity that monotonically decreases with d .\nIncreasing b results in a monotonic increase of the maximal possible soliton velocity at\nfixed d . Thus, at d = 5 the maximal velocity is \u03b1m = 0.631 for b = \u22121 , while one gets\n\n\u03b1m = 0.758 for b = \u22122 , and \u03b1m = 0.913 for b = \u22124 . Therefore, in nonlocal media the\nmaximal velocity increases with b slower than in local media, where \u03b1m = (\u2212b)1/ 2 .\nTo study gray soliton stability we performed simulations of Eqs. (1) with input\nconditions q\n\n\u03be =0\n\n= (u + iv )(1 + \u03c1), where \u03c1(\u03b7) \u0013 1 is a broadband noise. Since we used a\n\nsplit-step Fourier method in simulations, we employed combinations of two identical\nsolitons with opposite signs of u separated by a huge distance. We found that single\ngray solitons are stable, including slowly moving almost dark solitons and solitons\nmoving with velocities close to \u03b1m and featuring multiple oscillations (Figs. 5(a) and\n5(b)). We studied the propagation of gray solitons nested on a wide Gaussian envelope,\nwhich does not qualitatively affect soliton dynamics. Only when, after a long-distance\npropagation, the moving gray soliton reaches the region where the background intensity\nof the host beam starts to decrease slowly, the soliton slightly accelerates, similarly to\ngray soliton propagating on finite background in local nonlinear media [19,21,22].\nThe presence of nonmonotonic tails in single gray solitons suggest the possibility\nto form bound states of several gray solitons moving with the same velocity. The\nsimplest bound state of two gray solitons is shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). Its intensity\ndistribution possesses local maximum in between two gray solitons forming the bound\nstate, while the refractive index profile has a shape of a waveguide which is capable to\nkeep the complex gray solitons together. A multiple intensity oscillations develop in the\nprofile of the bound states when their velocity approaches the maximal value \u03b1m , which\nis almost equal to that for single solitons; it also rapidly decreases with d . In contrast to\nsingle solitons, for bound states the rescaled energy U r is a monotonically increasing\nfunction of \u03b1 . When \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1m the energy flow U r diverges. Calculations suggest that\nstable extended trains of gray solitons are possible. Numerical simulations for bound\n\n4\n\n\fstates of two and three gray solitons showed that such states are completely stable at\nsmall and moderate velocities \u03b1 (Figs. 5(c) and 5(d)), but may exhibit weak instabilities\nwhen \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1m .\nWe thus conclude by stressing that a nonlocal nonlinearity drastically affect the\nprofiles, velocities, and interactions between gray solitons. Particularly important is the\nfinding of a maximum possible soliton velocity in nonlocal media that decreases fast with\nhigh nonlocality. Our findings suggest a feasible way to steer gray soliton light beams,\nby tuning the strength of nonlocality in different nonlinear media.\n\n5\n\n\fReferences with titles\n1.\n\nW. Krolikowski, O.
