We show that the moduli space of SUX (r, L) of rank r bundles of fixed\ndeterminant L on a smooth projective curve X is separably unirational.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn a discussion V. B. Mehta pointed out to me that for certain applications about the\ncohomology of moduli of vector bundles on smooth projective curves over algebraically\nclosed fields in characteristic p it is necessary to have that SUX (r, L) is separably unirational. This short note provides us with a proof of this statement.\nTheorem 1. Let X be a projective curve of genus g \u2265 2 over an algebraically closed field\nk of arbitrary characteristic. We fix a line bundle L on X. The moduli space SUX (r, L) of\nS-equivalence classes of semistable vector bundles of rank r with determinant isomorphic\n2\nto L is separably unirational, that means there exists an open subset U \u2282 P(r \u22121)(g\u22121) , and\nan \u00e9tale morphism U \u2192 SUX (r, L).\nFor a discussion of the notion separable unirationality and typical applications see the\nlecture notes [2, 1.10 and 1.11]. If the characteristic of k is zero, then separably unirational\nand unirational coincide. Thus, in this case the result is well known (see for example page\n53 in Seshadri's lecture notes [1]).\n2. Proof of theorem 1\nLet d = deg(L) be the degree of L. Fix a line bundle M such that deg(M) < dr \u2212 2g.\nLet E be any semistable vector bundle on X with rk(E) = r, and det(E) \u223c\n= L. Set\nM0 := M \u2295(r+1) , and M1 := M \u2297(r+1) \u2297 L\u22121 .\nIf Ext1 (M, E) 6= 0, then by Serre duality Hom(E, M \u2297 \u03c9X ) 6= 0. M \u2297 \u03c9X is a stable\nbundle of slope \u03bc(M \u2297 \u03c9X ) = deg(M) + 2g \u2212 2 < \u03bc(E). Thus, there can be only the zero\nmorphism in Hom(E, M \u2297 \u03c9X )0. So we have Ext1 (M, E) = 0.\nBy the same argument we conclude that Ext1 (M, E(\u2212P )) = 0 for every point P \u2208\nX(k). Therefore Hom(M, E) \u2192 Hom(M, E \u2297 k(P )) is a surjection. We conclude that\nHom(M, E) \u2297 M \u2192 E is surjective. Since X is of dimension one, for a general subspace\nV \u2282 Hom(M, E) of dimension r + 1 the restriction V \u2297 M \u2192 E is surjective. We\n\u03c0\nobtain a surjection M0 \u2212\u2192 E.

HEIN\n\nis det(ker(\u03c0)) \u223c\n= M0 \u2297 det(E)\u22121 = M \u2297(r+1) \u2297 L\u22121 = M1 . Taking one isomorphism\n\u223c\nM1 \u2212\u2192 ker(\u03c0) we obtain for any E as before the existence of a short exact sequence\n\u03b9\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c0\n\n0 \u2192 M1 \u2212\u2192 M0 \u2212\u2192 E \u2192 0 .\n\nWe use this to parameterize all bundles in SUX (r, L) as cokernels of morphisms M1 \u2192 M0 .\np\n\nTo do so, we define V := Hom(M1 , M0 )\u2228 , consider P(V ) o\n\nq\n\nX , and\nthe natural morphism p OP(V ) (\u22121) \u2297 q M1 \u2212\u2192 q M0 . We denote the cokernel of \u03b1 by E.\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03b1\n\nP(V ) \u00d7 X\n\n/\n\n\u2217\n\nLet U1 be the open subset of points u \u2208 P(V ) such that Eu := q\u2217 (E \u2297p\u2217 k(u)) is a semistable\n\u03c1\nbundle on X. We see that the resulting morphism gives a surjection U1 \u2212\u2192 SUX (r, L).\nNext we show that \u03c1 is infinitesimal surjective. We take a point [\u03b9] \u2208 P(V ) corresponding\nto a short exact sequence (1). Let D = k[\u03b5]/\u03b52 be the ring of dual numbers. To give an\ninfinitesimal deformation of E corresponds to give a flat family ED on XD = Spec(D) \u00d7X\nwhich specializes to E when restricting to the reduced fiber X0 \u223c\n= X. Since we want to\n\u2217\nconsider deformations with fixed determinant we have an isomorphism det(ED ) \u223c\nL\n= qD\nwhere qD is the projection XD \u2192 X. The flat deformation ED yields a short exact\nsequence 0 \u2192 E \u2192 ED \u2192 E \u2192 0 on Spec(D) \u00d7k X which gives the exact sequence\n\u2217\nHomXD (qD\nM0 , ED )\n\n/\n\n\u2217\nHomXD (qD\nM0 , E)\n\n/\n\n\u2217\nExt1XD (qD\nM0 , E)\n\n\u03c0 \u2208 HomX (M0 , E)\n\nExt1X (M0 , E)\n\nSince M0 = M \u2295(r+1) we conclude from Ext1 (M, E) = 0 that Ext1 (M0 , E) = 0. So \u03c0 is\n\u2217\nthe restriction of some \u03c0D \u2208 HomXD (qD\nM0 , ED ) to the reduced fiber. The morphism \u03c0D :\n\u2217\n\u2217\nqD M0 \u2192 ED is surjective. Again ker(\u03c0D ) is isomorphic to the line bundle det(qD\nM0 ) \u2297\n\u22121\n\u2217\n\u22121\n\u2217\ndet(ED ) = qD (det(M0 ) \u2297 L ) = qD M1 . Fixing such an isomorphism we obtain a short\nexact sequence of OXD bundles\n\u03b9\n\n\u03c0\n\nD\nD\n\u2217\n\u2217\nqD\nM0 \u2212\u2192\nED \u2192 0 .\n0 \u2192 qD\nM1 \u2212\u2192\n\nWe conclude that any deformation ED of E is induced by a deformation \u03b9D of \u03b9. Now for\na general linear subspace L \u2282 P(V ) of dimension dim SUX (r, L) = (r 2 \u2212 1)(g \u2212 1) passing\nthrough a stable [E] \u2208 P(V ) the composition of tangent maps is an isomorphism to\nTSUX (r,L),E . Thus, on some Zariski open subset U \u2282 (L \u2229 U1 ) containing [E] the morphism\nU \u2192 SUX (r, L) is \u00e9tale.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] C. S.
