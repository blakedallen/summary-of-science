Rhythmic behaviors in neural systems often combine features of limit cycle dynamics (stability and periodicity) with features of near heteroclinic or near homoclinic cycle dynamics\n(extended dwell times in localized regions of phase space).

Introduction. Animals often generate specific sequences of behavior, for example the movements of the limbs during walking, the feeding apparatus while chewing and swallowing, or body undulations in swimming. When a repeated sequence of\nmotions can be produced reliably, the pattern generator circuit controlling the behavior is typically modeled as an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations\nadmitting a stable isolated periodic orbit, i.e. a limit-cycle oscillator [30, 57]. Limit\ncycle oscillators have played a fundamental role in understanding the generation and\ncontrol of repetitive motions underlying swimming in the lamprey [12, 15], neural activity and bursting [17, 31], the gaits of quadrupeds [13, 27] bipeds [35] and monopeds\n[9, 14], as well as cardiac and respiratory activity [19, 42, 43], inter alia.\nAnother class of systems generating reproducible sequences of activity has been\n1\n\n\fproposed under the rubric of stable heteroclinic sequences [5] or stable heteroclinic\nchannels [37]. A dynamical system possesses a heteroclinic sequence if there exists\na chain of hyperbolic saddle fixed points for which the unstable manifold of each\nsaddle intersects the stable manifold of the next [2]; they generalize the notion of a\nstable heteroclinic cycle, an attractor comprising a finite collection of saddle points\nwith heteroclinic connections linking them in a repeating chain [7, 28, 48, 49]. A\nheteroclinic cycle is stable or attracting when the product around the cycle of the\nsaddle values is strictly greater than unity; the saddle value for a hyperbolic saddle\npoint with eigenvalues \u03bbu > 0 > \u03bb1s \u2265 \u03bb2s \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbn\u22121\nis the ratio \u2212\u03bb1s /\u03bbu . Stable\ns\nheteroclinic sequences and cycles have been proposed to provide a framework within\nnonlinear dynamics for understanding a range of phenomena, including olfactory processing in insects [36], search behavior in the marine mollusk Clione limacina [56],\n\"winnerless competition\" in neural circuits [1, 4] and ecological models [2], genesis of\nnetwork-dependent bursting activity [34], and the balance of emotion and cognition\nin behavioral control [3] as well as other areas [38].\nBecause they require the intersection of one dimensional unstable and codimension one stable manifolds, the saddle connections comprising a heteroclinic cycle are\nstructurally unstable [6]. For planar systems, Reyn showed that a phase portrait\ncontaining a separatrix polygon generically forms a limit cycle when subject to a perturbation satisfying a net inflow condition [41], provided the unperturbed heteroclinic\ncycle is attracting. Trajectories near an unperturbed attracting heteroclinic cycle\ntraverse the cycle with longer and longer return times; the trajectory along the cycle\nitself has \"infinite period\".\nAs an example, consider the system defined on the 2-torus 0 \u2264 yi \u2264 2\u03c0, i \u2208 {1, 2}.\ndy1\n= f (y1 , y2 ) = cos(y1 ) sin(y2 ) + \u03b1 sin(2y1 )\ndt\ndy2\n= g(y1 , y2 ) = \u2212 sin(y1 ) cos(y2 ) + \u03b1 sin(2y2 )\ndt\n\n(1.1a)\n(1.1b)\n\nAs shown in Figure 1.1a, this system has four saddle points connected by heteroclinic\nconnections. The saddles have identical eigenvalues \u03bbu = 1 \u2212 2\u03b1, \u03bbs = \u22121 \u2212 2\u03b1 for\n(\ufe01\n)\ufe014\n1+2\u03b1\na saddle value of V = 1\u22122\u03b1\n. If \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/2) then V > 1, indicating that the\nheteroclinic 4-cycle is attracting.\nAlthough the heteroclinic cycle connecting the four saddle points is structurally\nunstable, any perturbation of the vector field that pushes the unstable manifold of\neach saddle towards the interior of the cycle relative to the stable manifold of the\nnext saddle will generically lead to the formation of a stable limit cycle. For example,\nconsider the effects of \"rotation\" of the flow of Equations 1.1 parametrized by 1 >\n\u03bc > 0.\ndy1\n= f (y1 , y2 ) + \u03bcg(y1 , y2 )\ndt\ndy2\n= g(y1 , y2 ) \u2212 \u03bcf (y1 , y2 )\ndt\n\n(1.2a)\n(1.2b)\n\nWe will refer to this system as the smooth system, in contrast to the piecewise linear\nsystem to be introduced subsequently. As shown in Figure 1.1b, for \u03bc > 0 the\nheteroclinic connections are broken, but a limit cycle has been created inside of the\nsaddles that passes near each of the saddle points.\n2\n\n\f\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212 \u03c02\n\n\u2212 \u03c02\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n\u2212 \u03c02\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n(a)\n\n\u2212 \u03c02\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u03c0\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1.1: Parametric perturbation of an attracting heteroclinic cycle to a stable limit\ncycle. Note solid line is x-nullcline and dashed is y-nullcline. (a) A trajectory of the\nsmooth toroidal system given by Equations 1.1, passing near four distinct saddles each\nwith eigenvalues \u03bbs = \u22121\u22122\u03b1 and \u03bbu = 1\u22122\u03b1. The trajectory shown begins near the\nunstable spiral point at location (\u03c0, \u03c0) near the center of the plot. The trajectory was\nintegrated for a total time of 200 units using \u03b1 = 7/30 and \u03bc = 0 . It passes closer to\neach successive saddle, slowing progressively. (b) The perturbed system, Equations\n1.2, when \u03b1 = 7/30 and \u03bc = 0.01, forms a stable limit cycle passing close to the\nfour saddle points. Please see corresponding movie (file smooth.mpg); this animation\ncycles through phase portraits for the smooth system for values of \u03bc varying from 0\nto 1/2 and back again. At \u03bc = 2\u03b1 the limit cycle collapses via a Hopf bifurcation to\na single stable fixed point located between the four surrounding saddles.\n\nFor any small positive value of \u03bc, the system 1.2 will have a stable limit cycle,\n\u03b3(t) = \u03b3(t + T ), with period T (\u03bc) \u2192 \u221e as \u03bc \u2192 0+ . For \u03bc > 0 we may identify a\nphase \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03b8max ) with each point on the limit cycle by chosing an arbitrary point\n\u03b30 to have phase \u03b8(\u03b30 ) = 0 and requiring d\u03b8/dt = 2\u03c0/T (\u03bc). Typically one chooses\n\u03b8max to equal either 2\u03c0 or unity. Because of the fourfold symmetry of the systems\nconsidered here it will be convenient to set \u03b8max = 4 throughout, so that traversal of\neach quarter of the limit cycle will correspond to a unit increment in phase. Figure\n1.2 illustrates the time course of trajectories of Equations 1.2 for \u03b1 = 7/30 and\n\u03bc \u2208 {10\u22123 , 0.1, 0.3, 0.45}.\nTo each point \u03be0 = (x0 , y0 ) in the basin of attraction of the limit cycle we may\nassign an asymptotic phase \u03c6(\u03be0 ) \u2208 [0, 4) satisfying ||\u03be(t) \u2212 \u03b3(t \u2212 \u03b8(\u03be0 )T /4)|| \u2192 0 as\nt \u2192 \u221e, where \u03be(t) and \u03b3(t) are solutions of 1.2 satisfying initial conditions \u03be(0) = \u03be0\nand \u03b3(0) = \u03b30 respectively, and ||(x, y)|| = |x| + |y|. The level curves of \u03c6, called\nisochrons, foliate the basin of attraction; see [31] for examples.\nAn important question for understanding the dynamics of control in central pattern generators is how such systems combine robustness to perturbation with flexibility to adapt behavior to variable environmental or physiological conditions.1 Many\n1 Whether\n\noriginating endogenously (neural noise, internal control mechanisms), or exogenously\n3\n\n\f1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.5\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n80\n\n100\n\n30\n\n120\n\n40\n\n15\n\n20\n\n10\n\n140\n\n50\n\n25\n\n15\n\nFig. 1.2: Time plots of limit cycle trajectories of the smooth system with various\nvalues of \u03bc. When \u03bc \u226a 1 the time plots exhibit prolonged dwell times due to slow\ntransits past the saddle points and relatively rapid transits between them. As \u03bc increases, the limit cycle moves away from the saddle points and the speed becomes\nmore uniform (note the change in horizontal scale). As a result, the time plots become more sinusoidal resembling an Andronov\u2013Hopf oscillator. The first and second\nordinates are shown in black and gray, respectively, with \u03b1 = 7/30. From top to\nbottom \u03bc = 10\u22123 , 0.1, 0.3, 0.45. Compare Figure 2.3.\n\nbiological systems combining repetitive behavior and behavioral or metabolic control\nexhibit limit cycle behavior that is strongly influenced by passage of trajectories near\n(environmental fluctuations), perturbations of the system's dynamics occur on a variety of time scales.\nFor clarity we will limit discussion to two extremes of fast and slow perturbations. Perturbations\noccurring on slow time scales relative to other system dynamics will be referred to below as static\nor parametric perturbations, for example fixing a value \u03bc > 0 in Equations 1.2. Fast perturbations\nwill be approximated as instantaneous trajectory dislocations.\n4\n\n\fone or more unstable fixed points or quasiequilibria. A recent model for the generation of multiple rhythmic states in a respiratory CPG featured slow excursions along\nequilibrium surfaces of model neurons voltage dynamics interspersed with fast jumps\nbetween these surfaces [42]. In this model, control of the rhythm through changes in\nthe period as well as the duration of different functional phases (inspiratory phase,\nexpiratory phase) could be effected by modulatory signals making small changes to\nthe dynamics of escape and release from inhibition, thereby changing the paths of\ntrajectories in the vicinity of quasiequilibria. Similarly, control of the net speed of\nmotion produced by a model locomotory CPG coupled to an explicit musculoskeletal\nsystem resulted from the adjustment of CPG trajectories in proximity to unstable\nfixed points of the model [45]. Patterns of biting, swallowing and rejection in Aplysia\nmay be understood in terms of sequential traversals between neuromechanical equilibrium points [50, 51]. During normal cell growth and proliferation a living cell passes\nrepeatedly through several phases (including cell division), yet the cell \"cycle\" is typically described not as a standard limit cycle but as a sequence of traversals between\nquasiequilibria that act as checkpoints [54].2 In the vicinity of each quasiequilibrium,\nthe cell cycle dynamics slows for an indefinite period of time, until a regulating condition is met [33]. In each of these examples, although the flow strictly speaking\nforms a deterministic limit cycle, the behavior may be actively managed through the\nintroduction of variable dwell times that function as control points along trajectories.\nFamilies of limit cycles verging on a heteroclinic (or homoclinic) cycle such as the\nlimit cycles of the one parameter family of systems given by Equations 1.2 provide an\nopportunity for studying the role of saddle points in the control of timing of rhythmic\nbehaviors. As a first step, it is natural to consider the structure of the infinitesimal\nphase resetting curves which reflect the sensitivity of the return time along the limit\ncycle to small instantaneous perturbations. When \u03bc = 0 the flow of Equations 1.2\ndoes not admit a periodic solution with finite period; consequently the asymptotic\nphase and hence the phase response is not well defined. However, for any \u03bc > 0 we\ncan defined the phase response, and we can study its behavior as the family of limit\ncycles approaches the heteroclinic cycle.\nTo fix terminology, for 1 \u226b \u03bc > 0, consider a trajectory \u03be(t) following a stable\nlimit cycle \u03b3 : t \u2208 [0, T ) \u2192 \u03b3(t) \u2208 Rn . Suppose the trajectory is perturbed by a\nsmall instantaneous displacement, taking x(t\u2212 ) = \u03b3(t + \u03b80 T /4) to x(t+ ) = \u03b3(t +\n\u03b80 T /4) + \u20d7r. Provided the new initial condition x(t+ ) remains within the basin of\nattraction of the limit cycle, the orbit will approach the limit cycle with ||x(t) \u2212\n\u03b3((t + \u03b81 T /4) mod T )|| \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e, for some new phase \u03b81 \u2208 [0, 4), resulting in\na shift in asymptotic phase equal to (\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b80 ) mod 4. The limit cycle's sensitivity\nto weak instantaneous perturbations typically varies both with the phase at which\nthe perturbation occurs, \u03b80 (t) = 4((t/T ) mod 1), and with the direction in which\nit occurs, \u03b7 = \u20d7r/||\u20d7r|| \u2208 Rn . Differences in sensitivity at different phases, which\nare important for understanding possible control mechanisms, are captured by the\ninfinitesimal Phase Response Curve or iPRC, defined as\n(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c6(\u03b3(\u03b8T /4) + \u03b5\u03b7)) mod 4\n.\n(1.3)\n\u03b5\nAs above, \u03c6(\u03be) is the asymptotic phase associated with a point \u03be in the basin of\nZ(\u03b8, \u03bc, \u03b7) = lim\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\n2 Strictly speaking, the system may be viewed as a limit cycle if the dynamics are embedded\nin a larger space encompassing the control variables as well; the point remains that the periodic\nbehavior is strongly influenced by passage near unstable equilibria or near-equilibria, which function\nto regulate the timing of the system.\n\n5\n\n\fattraction for the limit cycle, \u03b8 is the phase at which the instantaneous perturbation is\napplied, \u03bc is the parameter controlling proximity to the heteroclinic, \u03b7 is the direction\nof the fast perturbation, \u03b3 is the limit cycle trajectory and T is its period; the latter\ntwo entities are functions of \u03bc. In order to study the behavior of the phase response as\nthe system approaches the heteroclinic configuration, it is important to emphasize the\nlimit defining the iPRC in Equation 1.3 is taken before the subsequent limit \u03bc \u2192 0.\nAnalytic calculation of the iPRC is typically accomplished via an adjoint equation\nmethod, and exact solutions are known in very few cases [23]. In order to perform the\nanalysis required to gain qualitative insight into the behavior of the phase response\nunder the sequential limits \u03b5 \u2192 0, \u03bc \u2192 0, we construct a piecewise linear approximation to the smooth system. The iris system, described below, is topologically\nequivalent on an open set including the family of limit cycles and the saddle points,\nand qualitatively captures the behavior of the smooth system. For the iris system\nwe obtain exact results including the form of the limit cycle for positive \u03bc and an\nexplicit formula for the infinitesimal phase response curve. Our main result, stated in\nTheorem 1 below, shows that for the iris system the sensitivity to small displacements\nparallel to the direction of the stable manifold has two regions with distinct sensitivity behavior. In the limit, as the family of orbits approaches the SHC, there is an\ninterval of phases \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c6c ] for which the infinitesimal phase response goes to zero.\nThis interval is separated by a critical phase \u03c6c from a second interval \u03c6 \u2208 (\u03c6c , 1]\nfor which the iPRC diverges to +\u221e. The junction \u03c6 = 0 mod 1 corresponds to the\nboundary between regions on which we define a piecewise linear dynamics. We show\nnumerically that qualitatively similar results hold for the smooth system.\nLimit cycles in piecewise linear (PWL) dynamical system have been studied previously in several contexts. For instance, in the context of Glass networks [20, 25, 26]\nPWL systems have been used to represent the dynamics of idealized genetic regulatory systems. In this case, the structure is somewhat different from that considered\nhere, in that the fixed point driving the flow in each piecewise linear region is strictly\nattracting and lies outside the region, rather than having one unstable eigendirection\nand lying inside the corresponding flow region. Consequently, families of limit cycles verging on a heteroclinic cycle do not appear in Glass networks. PWL planar\ndynamical systems in which a fixed point and a limit cycle coexist do occur in models approximating the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations; such systems were used to study\ntraveling wave phenomena [32] and period adding bifurcations under periodic forcing\n[18]. Neither homoclinic nor heteroclinic cycles appear in these systems, however.\nRecently, Coombes investigated phase response curves for limit cycles in both the\nPWL McKean-Nagumo model and a new model related to the Morris-Lecar system\n[16]; this paper exploited the existence of exact solutions for the PRC to study synchronization in gap-junction coupled networks, in both the strong and weak coupling\nlimits. The PWL Morris-Lecar system does contain a homoclinic bifurcation; to the\nbest of our knowledge, however, the analysis presented here is the first to obtain exact\nresults for the scaling of the infinitesimal phase response curve, as a system of limit\ncycles approaches a heteroclinic or homoclinic orbit.\n2. The piecewise linear iris system. As \u03bc \u2192 0+ , the period of the limit\ncycle in system 1.2 diverges and the asymptotic phase may no longer be defined.\nNevertheless, the response of the system to small, transient perturbations remains of\ninterest. To explore behavior analogous to phase resetting in the \u03bc \u2192 0+ limit, we\nintroduce a piecewise linear planar dynamical system analogous to the smooth system\nin Equations 1.1. Figure 2.1a illustrates the construction: we tile the plane with large\n6\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 2.1: Construction of the iris system from the smooth system. (a) The flow near\neach saddle point of the smooth system (1.2) is approximately linear in a square region\naligned with the (orthogonal) eigenvectors. By virtue of the fourfold symmetry of the\nsystem we can extend each square until it has a side of length 2b, remaining centered\non the saddle. Depending on the extent of the rotational (parametric) perturbation of\nthe vector field, there will be square of side a forming a gap around the unstable spiral\npoint. (b) We extend the linearized flow for each saddle throughout the corresponding\nsquare of side 2b, creating a piecewise linear vector field defined on the plane with\nthe squares of side a removed. The ith square is centered on the ith saddle, xi\ns\n(i = 1, 2, 3, 4). In each square the inward arrows indicate Wloc\nand the outward arrows\nu\nindicate Wloc , parallel to the stable and unstable eigenvector directions, respectively.\n\nsquares of size 2b centered on each saddle and smaller squares of size a between them.\nWhen the rotation parameter \u03bc is zero, the large squares align and the square of side a\nvanishes. As the vector field \"rotates\" in the vicinity of each saddle, the squares rotate\nand a increases from zero. Within each square, we introduce coordinates \u03be = (s, u)\nwith respect to which the local flow obeys ds/dt = \u2212\u03bbs and du/dt = u. Here \u03bb > 0 is\nthe eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector (1, 0) tangent to the stable manifold\ns\nWloc\n= {(s, 0)| \u2212 b < s < b}. The unstable manifold W u = {(0, u)| \u2212 b < u < b}\nis tangent to the eigenvector (0, 1) corresponding to the unstable eigenvalue, which\nwithout loss of generality is set to one. The stable and unstable eigenvectors are\narranged so that when a > 0 the flow on the inner quadrants of each square moves\nclockwise; the flow leaving the square around the ith saddle enters the square around\nthe i + 1st saddle (mod 4), as shown in Figure 2.1.\nFormally, for k \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4} let the center of the\u221ak th square, (xk , yk ), be given\nby the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of zk = 2(\u2212i)k (be\u2212i\u03c0/4 + (a/2)ei\u03c0/4 ),\nwhere 0 \u2264 a < b. Define the k th square to be Sk = {(x, y) : |x \u2212 xk | \u2264 b & |y \u2212 yk | \u2264\nb}. In the interior of the first square, the flow satisfies x \u0307 = \u2212\u03bb(x \u2212 x1 ) and y \u0307 = y \u2212 y1 .\nThe flow in the interior of squares two through four is defined so that the vector field is\nequivariant with respect to fourfold rotation about the origin. Adjacent squares form\na boundary of length (2b\u2212a). At the boundary between Sk and Sk+1 (mod k), the flow\nleaves Sk and enters Sk+1 , by construction. The vector field is discontinuous across\nthese boundaries. For definiteness, we take the flow at points on the mutual boundary\n7\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFig. 2.2: The behavior of the iris system depends on the offset a. The system is\nshown rotated through an angle of \u2212 tan\u22121 (a/b) for easier visual comparison with the\nsmooth system. (a) [a = 0] When the offset a is 0, the unstable manifold of each\nsaddle connects to the stable manifold of the next, forming a stable heteroclinic orbit.\n(Thin blue line: sample trajectory.) (b) [a = 0.05] When 0 < a \u226a 1, a stable limit\ncycle exists that passes close to the saddles. Its basin of attraction extends inward\nto a small, unstable limit cycle around the center (dotted black line). (c) [a = 0.2]\nAs a increases, the limit cycle becomes more rounded and the flow along the limit\ncycle more regular. (d) [a = 0.255] If a continues to grow, the stable limit cycle\nis destroyed in a fold bifurcation with the inner unstable limit cycle. Please see\ncorresponding movie (file: iris.mpg); this animation cycles through phase portraits\nof the iris system for values of a ranging from 0 to 0.255 and back again.\n\nSk \u2229 Sk+1 of adjacent squares to be defined so that the vector field is continuous when\napproached from square Sk+1 , the square into which the trajectories enter.\nThe four offset squares may be repeated to form a partial tiling of the plane,\nleaving a complementary set composed of smaller squares of size a. We will view the\nentire system as confined to the 2-torus, however. We leave the flow unspecified in the\n8\n\n\finteriors of the small squares, and we take any egress points from a large square into\na small square to be absorbing, i.e. the flow is set to zero at the boundary of the small\nsquares. Since we are interested in the phase response of limit cycles whose basins\nof attraction are entirely contained within the larger squares, the flow in the smaller\nsquares is of no consequence. Figure 2.2 illustrates the system, and shows sample\ntrajectories for different values of a. We will refer to the piecewise linear system as\nthe iris system because it resembles the iris of a camera, opening and closing as a\nincreases or decreases.\nIt is clear that the iris system will form a stable heteroclinic orbit when a =\n0 (corresponding to \u03bc = 0 in the smooth system); we will show in S 3.2 that it\nalso exhibits stable limit cycles passing near the saddles for small values of a > 0\n(corresponding to \u03bc > 0) as shown in Figure 2.2. When the limit cycle exists, as\nabove, we assign a phase \u03b8 to each point \u03b3 in the cycle as the fraction of the cycle's\nperiod (scaled by \u03b8max = 4) required to reach that point from a defined starting\npoint \u03b3(0) = \u03b30 on the cycle, i.e.\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00\n4\nmin {t > 0 | \u03b3(t) = \u03bd}\n(2.1)\nT\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00\nwhere T is the period, i.e. T = min {t > 0 | \u03b3(t) = \u03b30 } . It is clear that with this\ntransformation d\u03b8/dt is constant and equal to 4/T . We define the point where the\nlimit cycle first enters the bottom left square (surrounding saddle S1 ) as \u03b30 .\nBecause the flow is piecewise linear, we may derive analytically the form of the\nphase response curve for any values of \u03bb > 1 > a > 0 for which a stable limit cycle\nexists.\nTheorem 1. Let \u03bb > 1 > a > 0, let the iris system be defined as in S2, and\ndefine the function\n\u03b8(\u03bd) =\n\n\u03c1(u) = u\u03bb \u2212 u + a.\n\n(2.2)\n\n1. If the function \u03c1 has two isolated positive real roots then the iris system has\na stable limit cycle. Let u denote the smallest positive real root of 2.2. The\nlimit cycle trajectory enters each square at local coordinates (1, u) and exits\neach square at local coordinates (s, 1) where s = u\u03bb . The period of the limit\ncycle is T = 4 log(1/u).\n2. Let \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 4) be the phase of an instantaneous perturbation in direction \u03b7\nand let \u03b8 = k + \u03c6 where \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1) and k \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}. If k = 0 then the\ninfinitesimal phase response of the limit cycle is\nZ(\u03b7, \u03c6, a) =\n\n\u03b7 * \u03b2(\u03c6)\nlog(1/u)(u \u2212 \u03bbs)\n\n(2.3)\n\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00\nwhere \u03b2(\u03c6) = s(1\u2212\u03c6) , u\u03c6 and \u03b7 = (\u03b7s , \u03b7u ) is a unit vector in the L1 norm. If\n\u2032\nk \u2208 {1, 2, 3} then the(\ufe02infinitesimal\n)\ufe02 phase response is given by Z(\u03b7 , \u03c6, a) where\n0 \u22121\n\u03b7 \u2032 = Rk \u03b7 and R =\n. The magnitudes of the phase responses to\n1\n0\nperturbations parallel to the stable and unstable eigenvector directions is greatest at phases corresponding to boundaries between piecewise linear regions.\n3. As a \u2192 0 for fixed \u03bb, the entry coordinate scales as u = a+o(a), the infinitesimal phase response to perturbations parallel to the unstable eigendirection in\na given square diverges, and the response to perturbations parallel to the stable\neigendirection diverges when \u03c6 \u2208 (1 \u2212 1/\u03bb, 1); otherwise, it converges to zero.\n9\n\n\fFigure 2.3 illustrates the time course of trajectories of the iris system for \u03bb = 2\nand a \u2208 {10\u22123 , 0.1, 0.2, 0.24}.\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121.0\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121.0\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121.0\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121.0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n5\n\n2\n\n30\n\n50\n\n10\n\n4\n\n2\n\n40\n\n6\n\n4\n\n60\n\n15\n\n8\n\n70\n\n80\n\n20\n\n10\n\n6\n\n12\n\n8\n\n25\n\n14\n\n10\n\nFig. 2.3: Time plots of limit cycle trajectories of the iris system with various values of\na. When a \u226a 1 the trajectories slow dramatically when passing near the saddles and\ntravel more quickly between them, resulting in time plots with prolonged dwell times.\nAs a increases, the limit cycle moves away from the saddle points and the limit cycle\ntrajectory becomes faster and more uniform in speed, resulting in time plots with a\nmore sinusoidal character. Note the change in horizontal scale. The horizontal and\nvertical ordinates are shown in black and gray, respectively, with \u03bb = 2. From top to\nbottom a = 10\u22123 , 0.1, 0.2, 0.24. Compare Figure 1.2.\n\nWhile a general consideration of phase resetting in the vicinity of a heteroclinic\nbifurcation on an invariant circle (or, similarly, near a homoclinic bifurcation) is beyond the scope of this paper, it is natural to conjecture that the limiting behavior of\nphase response curves near such bifurcations may be similar to that observed here.\nLemmas 3 and 4 in S3 provide necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee\n10\n\n\fthe existence of a stable limit cycle. Lemmas 6, 7 and 8 in S4 develop the response of\na limit cycle trajectory to a small transient perturbation, leading to direct calculation\nof the infinitesimal phase response curve. Lemmas 10 and 11 in S5 describe the\nasymptotic behavior of the iris system in the heteroclinic limit, i.e. as a \u2192 0. In S5\nwe also compare analytic and numerical results for the phase response curves of the\niris system. In S6 we numerically explore the isochrons of the iris system. Finally\nin S7 we numerically obtain phase response curves for the smooth system given by\nEquations 1.1 and compare their structure with those of the iris system.\nIn [11] Brown et al. studied phase response curves for limit cycles near the four\ncodimension one bifurcations leading to periodic firing in standard neuronal models\n(saddle-node bifurcation of fixed points on a periodic orbit; supercritical Hopf bifurcation; saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles; homoclinic bifurcation). Their analysis\nof the homoclinic bifurcation corresponds to our analysis of the iris system in a certain\nlimit; for a detailed comparison see S8.2.\n3. Limit Cycles in the Iris System. We now prove several results about the\niris system that we will need to prove Theorem 1. We start by studying the trajectory\nwithin one of the square regions to construct a map from the time and position of entry\ninto the region to the time and position of egress out of the region. Next, we connect\nfour of the linearized regions together. We then prove the existence of a limit cycle\nfor sufficiently small values of a > 0. We also examine the effects of a perturbation of\nthe trajectory within the neighborhood on the exit time and exit position. We use the\nmaps thus derived to show that a stable limit cycle exists, and use the perturbation\nresults to determine the asymptotic effect of a small perturbation on the phase of the\noscillator (i.e. the phase response curve). First, we will examine the dynamics within\na single linear region around a saddle of the iris system.\nRemark 2 (Nondimensionalization). Assume each saddle of the iris system has\ntwo real orthogonal eigenvectors, one stable and one unstable. Assume the region\naround each saddle is a square aligned with these vectors and centered on the saddle\nwith a length of 2L along each side (so that the saddle is a distance of L away from\neach edge). We will refer to the unstable eigenvalue of the saddle as \u03bbu > 0 and the\nstable eigenvalue as \u03bbs < 0. The trajectories within the region have the dynamics\ndu\n= \u03bbu u.\ndt\n\nds\n= \u03bbs s,\ndt\n\n(3.1)\n\nAssume that when a trajectory leaves the edge of one region at position xf = (sf , uf ) =\n(sf , L), it enters the next region with an offset of a, i.e. xi = (si , ui ) = (L, sf + a).\nWe assume that there is a cycle of four regions the trajectory may traverse this way.\nWe can nondimensionalize the system by defining the new state variables s* = s/L\nand u* = u/L, by rescaling time as t* = \u03bbu t and the offset as a* = a/L. We may\ndefine \u03bb = \u2212\u03bbs /\u03bbu as the saddle ratio, which will play a critical role in stability (S3.2).\nUsing these definitions, the governing equations become\nds*\n= \u2212\u03bbs* ,\ndt*\n\ndu*\n= u* .\ndt*\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe will use the non-dimensionalized version of the system for the remainder of the\npaper. For simplicity of notation, we will omit the asterisks in the sequel.\n3.1. Dynamics Within A Linear Region. Within a single square region surrounding a given saddle point, we will use the local coordinates (s, u) to represent\n11\n\n\fthe displacement parallel to the stable and unstable eigenvectors, respectively. The\nline segments {(s, 0) \u2208 R2 |0 \u2264 s \u2264 1} and {(0, u) \u2208 R2 |0 \u2264 u \u2264 1} are part of\nthe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle, respectively, forming separatrices of\nthe flow in the square. We will restrict attention to flow entering the square along\nthe edge {(1, u) \u2208 R2 |0 < u < 1}. It is easy to see that a trajectory entering at\nan initial point xi \u2261 (si , ui ) = (1, ui ) at time ti with ui > 0 will exit at point\n(sf , uf ) = (sf , 1) = (u\u03bbi , 1) at time log(1/ui ). We define the map fl : R \u2192 R from\nan entry position along the s = 1 edge to an exit position along the u = 1 edge of\nthe region of linear flow, and a function T1 (ui ) representing the transit time from an\nentry position (1, ui ):\nfl (ui ) = u\u03bbi ,\n\nT1 (ui ) = log(1/ui ).\n\n(3.3)\n\nNote that fl is a monotonically increasing function of ui and that T1 is a monotonically\ndecreasing function of ui .\nThe closest approach of a trajectory to the saddle point occurs when the position\nx = (s, u) is perpendicular to the velocity v = (\u2212\u03bbs, u), or 0 = \u2212\u03bb exp[\u22122\u03bbt] +\nu2i exp[2t]. Similarly, one may calculate the time at which the speed of the trajectory\nis minimal. These times are\ntclosest =\n\nlog \u03bb \u2212 2 log ui\n,\n2(\u03bb + 1)\n\ntslowest =\n\n3 log \u03bb \u2212 2 log ui\n.\n2(\u03bb + 1)\n\n(3.4)\n\nWe can examine the position of closest approach by integrating the system from the\nentry position for a time tclosest , which gives the location\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe001/(2\u03bb+2)\nuclosest = ui etclosest = ui \u03bb/u2i\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00\u03bb/(2\u03bb+2)\nsclosest = e\u2212\u03bbtclosest = u2i /\u03bb\nTaking the ratio of the two coordinates we find\nuclosest = \u03bb1/2 sclosest ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nand thus the point of closest approach of each trajectory in this quadrant lies along\na line passing through the saddle. A similar calculation using tslowest shows that the\nslowest points lie along the line\nuslowest = \u03bb3/2 sslowest\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhich also passes through the saddle point at the origin of the local coordinate system.\n3.2. Dynamics Across Regions. We will next explore the conditions under\nwhich the iris system contains a limit cycle.\nLemma 3. The iris system described in S2 contains a limit cycle iff the function\n\u03c1(u) = u\u03bb \u2212 u + a\nhas isolated real roots u\u2020 , u\u2021 \u2208 (0, 1), with u\u2020 \u2264 u\u2021 . These roots exist iff \u03bb > 1 and\n\u03bb\u03bb/(1\u2212\u03bb) \u2212 \u03bb1/(1\u2212\u03bb) + a \u2264 0.\nProof. To track crossings between regions, we will add a subscript to the variable\nnames indicating how many region crossings have occurred since time t = 0, so that\nui,3 is the ingress location (ui ) immediately after the third crossing.\n12\n\n\fWhen a > 0, trajectories leaving one region enter the next with an offset a,\ni.e. (si,n+1 , ui,n+1 ) = (1, sf,n + a). We therefore have a second monotonically increasing map from the point of egress along the edge of one square to the entry point along\nthe edge of the next square, fe : sf,n \u2192 ui,n+1 = sf,n + a.\nWe can now form a map from the entry position along the edge of one linear\nregion to the entry position along the edge of the next region via the composition\nh(ui ) = (fe \u2218 fl )(ui ) = (ui )\u03bb + a.\n\n(3.7)\n\nAs the composition of two monotonically increasing maps, h is also monotonically\nincreasing. Noting that the entry edges form a transversal section of the flow, it is clear\nthat h4 , the fourfold composition of h, forms a Poincar\u00e9 map for any cycles crossing\nthis edge. Limit cycles will form isolated fixed points in this map, so to find potential\nlimit cycles we look for points where ui = h4 (ui ). Because h is composed of four\nidentical monotonic maps, the limit cycles will also be fixed points in these component\nmaps and thus we have a fixed point at ui = u if and only if u = h(u) = u\u03bb + a, or\nequivalently \u03c1(u) \u2261 u\u03bb \u2212 u + a = 0, (cf. Equation 2.2).\nWe now consider the potential values of \u03bb, which by definition must be positive.\nFirst, consider 0 < \u03bb < 1. Rewriting \u03c1(u) as u\u03bb (1 \u2212 u1\u2212\u03bb ) + a and remembering\nthat u \u2208 (0, 1), we can see that \u03c1(u) is now the sum of a positive product and a\nnon-negative parameter, and thus cannot be zero. Next, consider \u03bb = 1. In this case\n\u03c1(u) becomes just a, and thus \u03c1 = 0 implies a = 0. Note that \u03c1 is independent of u\nand thus every u \u2208 (0, 1) is a solution, corresponding to a one parameter family of\nneutrally stable, non-isolated orbits. Therefore \u03bb must be greater than one if a limit\ncycle exists.\nDifferentiating \u03c1 twice with respect to u, we find that \u03c1 is convex for all u > 0\nwhen \u03bb > 1, and differentiating it once we find that \u03c1 has a minimum at\n(ui )min = \u03bb1/(1\u2212\u03bb) .\n\n(3.8)\n\nBecause \u03c1(u) is continuous, and equal to a when u = 0 or u = 1, by the midpoint\ntheorem it will have a root between 0 and (ui )min and a root between (ui )min and 1\niff\n0 \u2265 r((ui )min ) = (ui )\u03bbmin \u2212 (ui )min + a = \u03bb\u03bb/(1\u2212\u03bb) \u2212 \u03bb1/(1\u2212\u03bb) + a.\n\n(3.9)\n\nWe will call the smaller root u\u2020 and the larger (possibly identical) root u\u2021 .\nFigure 3.1 illustrates the map h = fe \u2218 fl when \u03bb = 2 and a = 0.2.\nWe now examine the stability of the roots u\u2020 and u\u2021 .\nLemma 4. If the roots u\u2020 and u\u2021 of Equation 2.2 exist and are distinct, u\u2020 gives\nthe entry position of a stable limit cycle along the s = 1 edge of a region and u\u2021 gives\nthe entry position of an unstable limit cycle along the same edge.\nProof. We can determine the stability of the two points by examining the derivative of h at these points; if |dh/dui | > 1 the fixed point will be unstable, and if\n|dh/dui | < 1 the point will be stable. Because the existence of the roots implies\n\u03bb > 1, we know dh/dui = (ui )\u03bb\u22121 \u03bb will be positive. Differentiating h a second time\nwe see that d2 h/du2i = (ui )\u03bb\u22121 (\u03bb \u2212 1)\u03bb is always greater than zero, and thus dh/dui\nis monotonically increasing. Since a fixed point in a map is stable iff the magnitude\nof the derivative at that point is greater than one, we find the point where dh/dui\npasses through 1:\n1 = dh/dui = \u03bb(ui )\u03bb\u22121\n13\n\n\f1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFig. 3.1: The map h = fe \u2218 fl from the entry position of a trajectory along the edge\na square to its entry position along the edge the next square forms a map analogous\nto a return map (blue curve). This map is continuous and monotonically increasing,\nso a limit cycle can only exist where a trajectory enters the next square at the same\nposition it entered the current square (green line indicates the identity map). In this\nexample there are two intersections corresponding to the stable and unstable limit\ncycles. Here a = 0.2 and \u03bb = 2. The blue curve meets the vertical axis at the offset\nbetween squares a, and changing the offset raises or lowers the blue curve without\nchanging its shape. Varying a allows for 0, 2, or 1 limit cycles (corresponding to\nFigure 2.2d, Figure 2.2c, and the fold bifurcation that occurs between them).\n\nor\nui = \u03bb1/(1\u2212\u03bb) .\nThis, however, is just (ui )min from Equation 3.8. Because this lies between the two\nroots, dh/dui |u\u2020 < dh/dui |(ui )min = 1, and thus u\u2020 is a stable fixed point of h, and\n1 = dh/dui |(ui )min < dh/dui |u\u2021 and thus u\u2021 is an unstable fixed point of h. Because\nh is a Poincar\u00e9 map at the entry plane of the region, these fixed points correspond to\nthe entry points of a stable and unstable limit cycle respectively.\nRemark 5. Lemmas 3 and 4 together establish Theorem 1, Part 1.\nAs just shown, for small positive a two limit cycles exist - one stable and one\nunstable. As a \u2192 0, the stable limit cycle is destroyed in a heteroclinic bifucation\nand the unstable limit cycle collapses to a point at the center of the system. As a\nincreases, the two limit cycles collide in a cycle-cycle fold bifurcation. The collision\noccurs when the inequality (3.9) becomes an equality.

When the stableto-unstable eigenvalue ratio \u03bb is sufficiently large relative to a, a stable and an unstable limit cycle coexist (region labeled 'stable limit cycle'). As a increases the two\nlimit cycles are destroyed in a fold bifurcation (line labeled 'fold bifurcation'). As a\napproaches 0, the system approaches a heteroclinic orbit (line labeled 'heteroclinic\norbit'). When a is sufficiently large or \u03bb < 1, trajectories spiral into the center as\nshown in Figure 2.2d (area labeled 'trajectories spirals into center'). When \u03bb = 1 and\na = 0, the system becomes a square filled with neutrally stable orbits (point labeled\n'neutrally stable orbits').\n\n(ui )min as the two limit cycles that cross the section at the two roots merge. Figure\n3.2 shows the bifurcation diagram.\n4. Effects of a small instantaneous perturbation. We now examine the\neffects of a small perturbation of a trajectory starting on the limit cycle. We will\nfirst explore the effects on the exit time and exit position from the square, and then\nextend our analysis to the asymptotic effect of the perturbation on phase over many\ncycles (the phase response curve or PRC).\n4.1. Initial effects of a small perturbation. Assume a trajectory begins on\nthe stable limit cycle at position x0 = (1, u\u2020 ) at time t = 0, and receives a small\nperturbation of size r in the direction of a unit vector \u03b7 = (\u03b7u , \u03b7s ) at time t\u2032 . We\nwill consider only perturbations that occur before the trajectory leaves the square\n(i.e. 0 \u2264 t\u2032 < T1 (u\u2020 ) = T1\u2020 ); earlier or later perturbations can be reduced to this\ncase by an appropriate time shift and discrete rotation. We will also require that\nthe perturbation not push the trajectory out of the basin of attraction of the limit\ncycle. The infinitesimal PRC we calculate below is obtained in the limit of small\n15\n\n\fperturbations; for finite a > 0, the basin of attraction has finite width, and trajectories\nthat escape the limit cycle's attracting set are not assigned an asymptotic phase.\nIt is straightforward to calculate the effects of the perturbation on the time and\nposition at which the trajectory leaves the square. We first consider the typical case\nwhere the perturbation does not push the trajectory across the border of the square.\nLemma 6. Consider a trajectory initially on the stable limit cycle \u03b3 of the iris\nsystem such that \u03b3(0) = (1, u\u2020 ), and a perturbation \u2206x of size ||\u2206x|| = r in the\ndirection of unit vector \u03b7 = (\u03b7s , \u03b7u ) = \u2206x/r at time 0 < t\u2032 < T1\u2020 . Assume the\nperturbation does not push the trajectory out of the basin of attraction or into another\nsquare. Then the perturbation will result in a change in the position of entry to the\nnext square\n(\ufe00\n\u2032\n\u2032 )\ufe00\n\u2206u\u20321 = \u03b7s (u\u2020 et )\u03bb + \u03b7u \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121 e\u2212t r + o(r)\n(4.1)\nand a change in transit time of the square\n\u2032\n\n\u2206T1\u2032 = \u2212(\u03b7u e\u2212t /u\u2020 )r + o(r),\n\n(4.2)\n\nas r \u2192 0.\nProof. Immediately before the perturbation occurs, the trajectory will be at the\npoint\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nlim\u2032 x(t) = (e\u2212\u03bbt , u\u2020 et ).\n\nt\u2192t \u2212\n\nThe perturbation shifts the position to\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nlim x(t) = (e\u2212\u03bbt + r\u03b7s , u\u2020 et + r\u03b7u ).\n\nt\u2192t\u2032 +\n\nThe trajectory will exit the square once xu grows to 1 at time\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00\n\u2032\nT1\u2032 = t\u2032 + \u2212 log(u\u2020 et + r\u03b7u )\nand enter the next square along the s = 1 edge at position\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nu\u20321 = a + (e\u2212\u03bbt + r\u03b7s )e\u2212\u03bb(T1 \u2212t ) = a + (e\u2212\u03bbt + r\u03b7s )(u\u2020 et + r\u03b7u )\u03bb\nFor r \u226a 1, we may write\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nT1\u2032 = t\u2032 \u2212 log(u\u2020 et ) \u2212 (\u03b7u e\u2212t /u\u2020 )r + o(r),\n(\ufe00\n\u2032\n\u2032 )\ufe00\nu\u20321 = a + (u\u2020 )\u03bb + \u03b7s (u\u2020 et )\u03bb + \u03b7u \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121 e\u2212t r + o(r)\n\u2032\n\nas r \u2192 0. Noting that t\u2032 \u2212 log(u\u2020 et ) = \u2212 log(ui ) = T1\u2020 and a + (u\u2020 )\u03bb = u\u2020 , these\nexpressions may be viewed as the exit time and position for the limit cycle with a\nlinear correction and additional higher order terms in r. That is,\n\u2032\n\nT1\u2032 = T1\u2020 \u2212 (\u03b7u e\u2212t /u\u2020 )r + o(r),\n(\ufe00\n\u2032\n\u2032 )\ufe00\nu\u20321 = u\u2020 + \u03b7s (u\u2020 et )\u03bb + \u03b7u \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121 e\u2212t r + o(r).\nSubtacting T1\u2020 and u\u2020 respectively then gives our result.\nPerturbations that push the trajectory across the boundary between two squares\ncan be handled without much additional difficulty. For example, we can treat a\n16\n\n\fperturbation that crosses into the next square as an advancement of the trajectory\nto the point that it enters the next square followed by a perturbation to the new\nlocation in the new square. Perturbations to the previous square can be handled in a\nsimilar fashion, as can perturbations to the diagonal square. However, for any finite\na > 0 and any perturbation time other than t\u2032 = 0 or t\u2032 = T1\u2020 , the perturbed point\nwill remain in the same square as the unperturbed point for sufficiently small r > 0.\nTherefore the additional cases do not alter the calculation of the PRC except possibly\nat a set of finite points, and they will be omitted.\n4.2. Subsequent effects of a perturbation. In the absence of perturbation,\nthe limit cycle passing through \u03b3(0) = (1, u\u2020 ) will exhibit a (constant) sequence of\nedge crossing locations ui,n = u\u2020 , n = {0, 1, 2, * * * } at a sequence of crossing times\nTn\u2020 = nT1\u2020 at constant intervals \u2206Tn\u2020 \u2261 T1\u2020 . A single perturbation \u2206x = r(\u03b7s , \u03b7u ) at\ntime t\u2032 will lead to a new sequence of edge crossings {u\u2032i,n } and crossing times {Tn\u2032 }.\nFollowing the perturbation, the time spent between the nth and n + 1st crossings is\n\u2032\n\u2032\noffset from the unperturbed dwell time: Tn+1\n\u2212 Tn\u2032 = T1\u2020 + \u2206Tn+1\n. Next we calculate\nthe change in entry position for subsequent edge crossings (\u2206u\u2032n = u\u2032i,n \u2212 u\u2020 ) and the\n\u2032\ndwell time offsets for subsequent squares (\u2206Tn+1\n).\nLemma 7. Under the conditions of Lemma 6, the entry position after the nth\ncrossing (n \u2265 1) will be offset by\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00n\u22121 (\ufe00\n\u2032\n\u2032 )\ufe00\n\u2206u\u2032n = \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121\n\u03b7s (u\u2020 et )\u03bb + \u03b7u \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121 e\u2212t r + o(r),\n\n(4.3)\n\nand the time spent in that square will be offset by\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00n\u22121 (\ufe00\n\u2032\n\u2032 )\ufe00\n\u2032\n\u2206Tn+1\n= (u\u2020 )\u22121 \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121\n\u03b7s (u\u2020 et )\u03bb + \u03b7u \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121 e\u2212t r + o(r),\n\n(4.4)\n\nas r \u2192 0.\nProof. A perturbed trajectory will enter the nth edge with an offset \u2206u\u2032n . This\nsituation is equivalent to a trajectory entering along the limit cycle that experiences\na perturbation in the u direction (\u03b7 = (0, 1)) of magnitude r = \u2206u\u2032n immediately\nupon entering the square. We can thus use Equation 4.1 with t\u2032 = 0 to find the entry\nposition along the next (n + 1st ) edge:\n\u2206u\u2032n+1 = \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121 \u2206u\u2032n + o(\u2206u\u2032n ).\nTherefore to leading order the sequence of offsets follows a geometric series, with\nclosed form\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00n\u22121\n\u2206u\u2032n = \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121\n\u2206u\u20321 + o(\u2206u\u20321 )\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00n\u22121 (\ufe00\n\u2032\n\u2032 )\ufe00\n= \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121\n\u03b7s (u\u2020 et )\u03bb + \u03b7u \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121 e\u2212t r + o(r),\nas r \u2192 0. Substitution into Equation 4.2 provides the deviation in the time of passage\nthrough each square, compared with that for the limit cycle trajectory. Again setting\n\u03b7 = (0, 1), r = \u2206u\u2032n , and t\u2032 = 0 gives\n\u2032\n\u2206Tn+1\n= \u2212(u\u2020 )\u22121 \u2206u\u2032n + o(u\u2032n )\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00n\u22121 (\ufe00\n\u2032\n\u2032 )\ufe00\n= \u2212(u\u2020 )\u22121 \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121\n\u03b7s (u\u2020 et )\u03bb + \u03b7u \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121 e\u2212t r + o(r).\n\n17\n\n\fWe now examine the asymptotic effect of the perturbation at long times. Because\nu\u2020 is less than one, both \u2206u and \u2206t will approach zero for large n. This is equivalent\nto saying that the orbit will asymptotically return the stable limit cycle, as expected.\nIt may, however, return with a different phase than the unperturbed trajectory.\nLemma 8. Under the conditions of Lemma 6, the cumulative change in crossing\ntimes after n crossings is\n(\ufe01\n(\ufe01\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00n+1 )\ufe01\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00n+2 )\ufe01\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b7s (u\u2020 et )\u03bb 1 \u2212 \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121\n+ \u03b7u e\u2212t 1 \u2212 \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\u22121\nr + o(r)\n\u2206Cn\u2032 = \u2212\nu\u2020 \u2212 \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\n(4.5)\nwhich converges to\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\u2206C\u221e\n=\u2212\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b7s (u\u2020 et )\u03bb + \u03b7u e\u2212t\nr + o(r).\nu\u2020 \u2212 \u03bb(u\u2020 )\u03bb\n\n(4.6)\n\nas n \u2192 \u221e.\nProof.

Infinitesimal phase response curve. We now derive the infinitesimal\nphase response curve. Initially, we restrict attention to perturbations occurring within\nthe first quarter cycle, i.e. within the first square. The PRC for perturbations occurring after k additional border crossings is obtained via a discrete rotation operation.\nWe define the phase of a point on the limit cycle as in Equation 2.1, i.e. as\nthe smallest amount of time required to reach that point from the point where the\nlimit cycle enters the first square. Therefore the asymptotic shift in crossing times\ntranslates into an asymptotic shift in phase as\n\u2206\u03c6 =\n\n\u2032\n\u2206C\u221e\n4\n\u2032\n\u2206C\u221e\n=\n,\nT\nlog(1/u\u2020 )\n\nrecalling that T = 4T1\u2020 = 4 log(1/u\u2020 ). Since e\u2212t = (u\u2020 )\u03c6 we may write \u03b2 in the form\n(\ufe01\n)\ufe01 (\ufe01\n)\ufe01\n\u03b2(\u03c6) = (\u03b2s (\u03c6), \u03b2u (\u03c6)) = (u\u2020 )\u03bb(1\u2212\u03c6) , (u\u2020 )\u03c6 = (s\u2020 )(1\u2212\u03c6) , (u\u2020 )\u03c6 ,\n(4.8)\nsimplifying the subsequent analysis. Thus the asymptotic change in phase for a perturbation at phase \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1) is\n\u2206\u03c6 =\n\n\u03b7 * \u03b2(\u03c6)\nr + o(r).\nlog(1/u\u2020 )(u\u2020 \u2212 \u03bbs\u2020 )\n\nThe infinitesimal phase response curve, obtained by taking the limit of \u2206\u03c6/r as r \u2192 0,\nis therefore\nZ(\u03b7, \u03c6, a) =\n\n\u03b7 * \u03b2(\u03c6)\n,\nlog(1/u\u2020 )(u\u2020 \u2212 \u03bbs\u2020 )\n\nwhich is Equation 2.3.\nFor a perturbation at phase \u03c6 \u2265 1, let k be the number of boundary crossings\npreceding the perturbation, i.e. the positive integer satisfying \u03c6 \u2208 [k, k + 1). Define\na k-fold quarter rotation operation on the phase variable and the direction of the\nperturbation by\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6\u2032 = \u03c6 \u2212 k\n\u2032\n\nk\n\n\u03b7\u2192\u03b7 =R \u03b7\n\n(\ufe02\n\n(4.9)\n(4.10)\n\n)\ufe02\n0 \u22121\nwhere R =\n. Then the infinitesimal phase response due to a perturbation\n1\n0\nin direction \u03b7 at phase \u03b8 > 0 is given by Z(\u03b7 \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 , a).\nThe dependence of the PRC on the phase is entirely contained in the term \u03b7 * \u03b2.\nConsider the components of the response to perturbation in the horizontal and vertical\ndirections. When \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1) the component \u03b2s along the direction of the stable\neigenvector corresponds to \u03b2x , the component in the horizontal direction. Similarly\n19\n\n\fthe components along the unstable direction \u03b2u and the vertical component \u03b2y are\nidentical. Moving clockwise around one full orbit we observe that:\nwhen\nwhen\nwhen\nand when\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1), \u03b2x = \u03b2s\n\u03c6 \u2208 [1, 2), \u03b2x = \u03b2u\n\u03c6 \u2208 [2, 3), \u03b2x = \u2212\u03b2s\n\u03c6 \u2208 [3, 4), \u03b2x = \u2212\u03b2u\n\nand\nand\nand\nand\n\n\u03b2y\n\u03b2y\n\u03b2y\n\u03b2y\n\n= \u03b2u ;\n= \u2212\u03b2s ;\n= \u2212\u03b2u ;\n= \u03b2s .\n\nFor each component the resulting phase response curve consists of two continuous\nsegments separated by a jump of size (u\u2020 + s\u2020 ), with antisymmetry \u03b2(\u03c6 + 2) = \u2212\u03b2(\u03c6).\nThe horizontal response component, \u03b2x , peaks at \u03b2x (1) = 1 and is strictly positive for\n\u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2). Similarly, \u03b2y peaks at \u03b2y (0) = 1 and is strictly positive for \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1)\u222a[3, 4).\nHence the extrema of both components occur at phase values corresponding to the\nboundaries between adjacent squares.\nRemark 9. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1, Part 2.\nFigure 4.1 shows examples of the full iPRCs as a function of \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 4) for \u03bb = 2\nand a \u2208 {10\u22123 , 0.1, 0.2, 0.24}.\n5. Asymptotic phase resetting behavior as a \u2192 0. We wish to study the\nasymptotic behavior of the phase resetting curve at the heteroclinic limit, that is,\nas the parameter a \u2192 0. This limit corresponds, at least by analogy, with the limit\n\u03bc \u2192 0 in the smooth vector field system of Equations 1.2.\nLemma 10. Under the conditions of Lemma 6, the limit cycle entry value scales\nas u\u2020 = a + o(a), as a \u2192 0.\nProof. Recall that u\u2020 is the smaller root of \u03c1(u), so u\u2020 = a + (u\u2020 )\u03bb . Since \u03bb > 1,\nclearly u\u2020 = a + o(u\u2020 ), as u\u2020 \u2192 0, and u\u2020 > a whenever u\u2020 > 0. For sufficiently\nsmall a > 0 we have u\u2020 as an implicitly defined function of a. It is straightforward\nto see that du\u2020 /da = 1 when u\u2020 = 0. We wish to show that u\u2020 = a + o(a) as well,\ni.e. that lima\u21920 (u\u2020 \u2212 a)/a = 0. Since u\u2020 = a + o(a), for any \u03b5 > 0 we can find\na \u03b4 > 0 such that 1 \u2212 a/u\u2020 < min[\u03b5/2, 1/2] whenever 0 < u\u2020 < \u03b4. If a < \u03b4 then\n(u\u2020 \u2212 a)/a = 1/(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 a/u\u2020 )) \u2212 1 = 1/(1 \u2212 x) \u2212 1 = x/(1 \u2212 x) where x = 1 \u2212 a/u\u2020 .\nSince x < min[\u03b5/2, 1/2], we are guaranteed that x/(1 \u2212 x) < \u03b5, as required.\nAs a decreases, the peaks of the iPRC grow, while their width shrinks. The\nintegral under each strictly positive region is\n\u222b\ufe01\nV =\n\n2\n\n\u03b2x (\u03c6) d\u03c6 =\n0\n\n1 + \u03bb \u2212 \u03bbu\u2020 \u2212 (u\u2020 )\u03bb\n\u03bb log(1/u\u2020 )\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhich goes to zero as u\u2020 \u2192 0 or equivalently as a \u2192 0. Lemma 11 characterizes the\nbehavior of the \"normalized\" iPRC \u03b1(\u03c6) = \u03b2(\u03c6)/V as a \u2192 0.\nLemma 11. For the iris system the vector \u03b1(\u03c6) = \u03b2(\u03c6)/V has the following\nproperties as a \u2192 0:\n1. For \u03c6 = 1 or 3, \u03b1x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, respectively. For \u03c6 \u0338\u2208 {1, 3}, \u03b1x \u2192 0.\n2. For \u03c6 = 0 or 2, \u03b1y \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, respectively. For \u03c6 \u0338\u2208 {0, 2}, \u03b1y \u2192 0.\n\u222b\ufe00 4\n3. 0 ||\u03b1(\u03c6)|| d\u03c6 = 4 (in the L1 norm).\nProof. As a \u2192 0 both V \u2192 0 and u\u2020 \u2192 0. At \u03c6 = 1, \u03b2x \u2261 1 for all a > 0,\nso as a \u2192 0 the ratio \u03b2x (1)/V \u2192 +\u221e. On the other hand, for fixed \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2)\u2216{1},\n(u\u2020 )\u03bb(1\u2212\u03c6) \u2192 0 as u\u2020 \u2192 0. The behavior of \u03b1x or \u03b1y within the other intervals follows\nfrom the symmetry relations discussed in the preceding paragraph. Thus 1 and 2 are\nestablished.

As a becomes small and the limit cycle approaches the heteroclinic\norbit, the phase response curve becomes dominated by peaks at the edges between\nsquares where flow changes from compressing trajectories outward to expanding them\ninward. As a grows and the flow along the limit cycle becomes more uniform, the\niPRC becomes less sharply peaked.

The asymptotic behavior of the phase\nresponse in the heteroclinic limit for each component is distinct. We rewrite the PRC\nto emphasize these contributions thus (restricted, for convenience, to the SW square,\nor \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1)):\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00\n(\ufe00\n)\ufe00\n\u03b7s (s\u2020 )(1\u2212\u03c6) + \u03b7u (u\u2020 )\u03c6\nZ(\u03b7, \u03c6, a) =\n.\n(5.5)\nlog(1/u\u2020 )(u\u2020 \u2212 \u03bbs\u2020 )\nFirst consider the response to perturbation along the unstable direction. Recall\nthat for any p > 0, up log u \u2192 0 as u \u2192 0+ . It follows after a brief calculation that\nfor any \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1)\n\u20d2\n\u20d2\n\u20d2\n\u20d2\nu\u03c6\n\u20d2\n\u20d2 = +\u221e.\nlim \u20d2\n\u20d2\nu\u21920+ log(1/u)(u \u2212 \u03bbu\u03bb )\nThis result means that regardless of the phase of the perturbation, the sensitivity\nof the asymptotic phase to small displacements parallel to the unstable eigenvector\ndiverges as the system approaches the heteroclinic bifurcation. The result is intuitively\nappealing because when the system is close to the heteroclinic bifurcation the long\nperiod leads to a larger \"compounding\" effect enhancing the cumulative result of a\nsmall perturbation within a given square. However, as is often the case when dealing\nwith nested limits, intuition can be misleading. In contrast to the preceding situation,\nconsider the response to perturbation along the stable direction. The behavior of the\nlimit now depends on the parameter \u03bb:\n\u20d2 {\ufe02\n\u20d2\n\u20d2\n\u20d2\nu\u03bb(1\u2212\u03c6)\n0,\n\u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1 \u2212 1/\u03bb]\n\u20d2=\nlim \u20d2\u20d2\n.\n\u03bb\n+\n+\u221e, \u03c6 \u2208 (1 \u2212 1/\u03bb, 1)\nlog(1/u)(u \u2212 \u03bbu ) \u20d2\nu\u21920\nThus, in the heteroclinic limit, small perturbations parallel to the stable eigenvector\nbecome inconsequential if they occur at an early enough phase. At a particular phase,\n\u03c6* = 1 \u2212\n\n1\n,\n\u03bb\n\nthe response becomes highly sensitive to arbitrarily small perturbation.\nRemark 13. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1, Part 3.\n22\n\n(5.6)\n\n\fFor comparison we can obtain from Equations 3.4 the fractional phases at which\nthe trajectory is closest to the saddle point (in the first square) or moving at the\nslowest speed:\n\u03c6closest =\n\n1 \u2212 log \u03bb/(2 log u\u2020 )\n,\n\u03bb+1\n\n\u03c6slowest =\n\n1 \u2212 3 log \u03bb/(2 log u\u2020 )\n.\n\u03bb+1\n\nAs u\u2020 \u2192 0 both phases converge to \u03c60 = 1/(\u03bb + 1), which is distinct from the phase\nat which the PRC's asymptotic sensitivity to perturbations in the stable direction\nchanges. Curiously, the asymptotic value \u03c60 of the phases of the slowest and closest\npoint along the trajectory coincides with \u03c6* ,\u221a\nthe critical phase for sensitivity, precisely\nwhen \u03bb is equal to the golden ratio, (1 + 5)/2 \u2248 1.618 * * * , because under those\nconditions 1 \u2212 1/\u03bb = 1/(\u03bb + 1).\n6. Isochrons. Provided a > 0 in the iris system, we may define isochrons as\nthe level sets of the asymptotic phase function \u03b8(x), for any point x in the basin of\nattraction of the limit cycle. As described in [11, 28, 31] and elsewhere, the points\non a given isochron will converge over time to a single point on the limit cycle with\na particular phase. Thus, in a sense, they represent points with the same asymptotic\na\n\"time\". As discussed above, given a limit cycle {\u03b3(t)}Tt=0\nthe asymptotic phase of a\npoint x0 is defined as the unique value in \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03b8max ) such that the limit\nlim |x(t) \u2212 \u03b3(t + \u03b8(x0 ))| = 0,\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere x(0) = x0 is the initial condition for the trajectory. The usual approach for\nfinding isochrons is based on an adjoint equation method, cf. ([11], Appendix A; see\nalso [23], Chapter 11). From the chain rule, the phase field must satisfy\n[\ufe01(\ufe01 )\ufe01\n]\ufe01 dx\n\u03b8max\nd\n\u20d7\n\u03b8(x(t)) = \u2207\u03b8\n(x(t)) *\n=\ndt\ndt\nT (a)\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhere T (a) is the period of the limit cycle for a given value of a > 0. Let (0 \u2264 s \u2264\n1, 0 \u2264 u \u2264 1) be local coordinates relative to any saddle of the iris system, i.e. such\nthat the flow satisfies s \u0307 = \u2212\u03bbs, u \u0307 = u. Writing \u03b8v for \u2202\u03b8/\u2202v, Equation 6.2 reads\n\u2212 \u03bbs\u03b8s + u\u03b8u = \u03b8max /T (a).\n\n(6.3)\n\nBy virtue of the fourfold rotational symmetry of the iris system, the following boundary conditions are required in addition to the PDE 6.2: for 0 < s < 1 \u2212 a,\n\u03b8(s, 1) = \u03b8(1, s + a) + 1\n\n(6.4)\n\nThe boundary condition renders the PDE nonlinear, and a simple closed form solution\nis not available. Solving the PDE numerically, however, is equivalent to finding the\nisochrons via direct simulation of trajectories for a suitable grid of initial conditions.\nWe used a 400\u00d7400 square mesh of initial conditions within each square, tracking\nsolutions until either they left the system of large squares (initial conditions on the\ninterior of the unstable limit cycle) or converged with a suitable tolerance to a small\nneighborhood of the limit cycle, at which point the asymptotic phase could be assigned. Figure 6.1 shows an example of the isochrons generated with this technique.\n23\n\n\fFig. 6.1: Isochrons for the iris system obtained via numerical iteration of the map\nfrom initial conditions to a sequence of boundary crossing. The iris system on the\ntorus has two distinct stable limit cycles for a > 0, illustrated here in two color\nschemes (green-blue and fuschia-violet). The tiling of the plane by periodic extension\nof the basic torus system is shown. Solid lines indicate the stable limit cycles, dashed\nlines indicate the unstable limit cycles. All limit cycles rotate clockwise. The flow\ninside the small squares is not defined, and points inside the unstable limit cycles are\nnot part of the basin of attraction of the stable limit cycles. The stable manifolds\nof each saddle comprise the separatrices between the basins of attraction of distinct\nstable limit cycles. The system shown has a = .2 and \u03bb = 2. Colors (online) indicate\nthe phase. Note the compression of the level curves near the boundaries between\nadjacent squares, which correspond to peaks in the phase response curve. Note also\nthat the isochrons are not strictly parallel to the stable eigenvalue direction (c.f. the\ndiscussion in S8.2). Please see corresponding movie (file: iris isochrons.mpg); this\nanimation illustrates the flow together with the isochron structure, by evolving points\nof equal phase forward together in time. After five seconds the animation changes to\nshowing isochron structures for different values of the unstable/stable manifold offset\nparameter a, from a = 0 to a = 0.247 and back again.\n\n24\n\n\f7. Smooth System. In order to compare the family of infinitesimal phase response curves obtained for the iris system with that of a family of continuous vector\nfields experiencing a similar heteroclinic bifurcation with fourfold symmetry, we numerically evaluated the phase response for small instantaneous perturbations in the\nhorizontal and vertical directions for limit cycles given by the system 1.1 for positive\nvalues of the twist parameter \u03bc. Figure 7.1 shows good qualitative agreement with\nthe concentration of phase response sensitivity at points along the trajectory near\ninteger values of the phase \u03c6, cf. Figure 4.1.\n8. Discussion. The iris system introduced here is one of only a handful of nonlinear dynamical systems for which an explicit form for the limit cycle or the phase\nresponse curve is known. For this system we show analytically that the sensitivity of\nthe response to small instantaneous perturbations depends (as one would expect) on\nthe distance to the heteroclinic bifurcation, on the phase at which the perturbation\noccurs, and the direction of the perturbation in the phase plane. In addition, we find\nthe intuitively appealing result that regardless of phase, as the static perturbation\naway from the heteroclinic vector field diminishes, the phase response as measured by\nthe iPRC becomes hypersensitive to any small perturbation parallel to the unstable\neigenvector direction, in that the iPRC diverges as the bifurcation parameter of the\niris system a \u2192 0. Unexpectedly, however, we also find that for perturbations along\nthe stable eigenvector direction, the response to some will diverge while the response\nto others will have no effect in the limit as a \u2192 0. The system appears ultrasensitive\nin this case to the phase at which the perturbation occurs, with perturbations sufficiently far in advance of the approach towards the saddle point effectively absorbed\nby the flow, in contrast to perturbations beyond a critical phase, \u03c6* = 1 \u2212 1/\u03bb, which\ndiverge as a \u2192 0. From a biological point of view, this dual sensitivity to the timing\nand direction of the transient perturbation is significant if flows structured by fixed\npoints are to be exploited in nature as control points for rhythmic behaviors. In neural\nsystems, for instance, it is commonplace to consider perturbations restricted to a single dimension in a multidimensional flow, namely perturbations along the dimension\nof membrane potential [11]. When a neuron's membrane potential lies in the linear\nregime, its dynamics is typically dissipative due to membrane conductances, tending\nto align the voltage direction with the stable direction for a subthreshold fixed point,\nat least for some portion of the flow. In general, if slowly adaptive modulatory processes within an organism's control circuitry can impose quasistatic perturbations of\nan existing vector field to move trajectories closer to or farther away from a homoor heteroclinic bifurcation point, the modulatory processes can filter which perturbations the system becomes sensitive to at different phases of the ongoing oscillation.\nInvestigating these possibilities in specific systems such as the feeding central pattern\ngenerator of the marine mollusk Aplysia will make it possible to test this prediction\nempirically.\n8.1. Sensitivity and control. Our results suggests that for systems in which a\ncontrol parameter can change the approach of trajectories towards a hyperbolic saddle\nfixed point with a one dimensional unstable manifold, the sensitivity to specific kinds\nof perturbations could be actively managed by manipulating the critical phase \u03c6* .\nThis is a novel kind of control for rhythmic behaviors; additional mechanisms for\ncontrol include manipulating the period of a typical trajectory by controlling the\ntime spent near a saddle point, and regulating the variable dwell time in different\nstates for a limit cycle trajectory passing near multiple unstable fixed points.\nOscillations arising from co-dimension one bifurcations other than a saddle node25\n\n\f150\n100\n50\n0\n\u221250\n\u2212100\n\u2212150\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0/2\n\n2\u03c0\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\u22124\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0/2\n\n2\u03c0\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\u22124\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0/2\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u221220\n\u221222\n\u221224\n\u221226\n\u221228\n\u221230\n\u221232\n\u221234\n\u221236\n\u221238\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0/2\n\n2\u03c0\n\nFig. 7.1: Infinitesimal phase response curves for the smooth system with various values\nof \u03bc. As \u03bc becomes small and the limit cycle approaches the heteroclinic orbit, the\nphase response curve becomes dominated by peaks much like the iris system shown in\nFigure 4.1. As \u03bc grows, the phase response curve becomes a sinusoidal as the system\napproaches an Andronov\u2013Hopf bifurcation.

From top to bottom,\n\u03bc = 10\u22123 , 0.1, 0.3, 0.45.\n\nhomoclinic have phase response curves near the bifurcation point that are smooth\nand sinusoidal. By contrast, many phase response curves observed in real systems\nshow sharp transitions between small and large responses, even in systems generating\nhighly regular behaviors such as swimming in the lamprey. Lamprey motor units\nparticipating in the CPG underlying smooth swimming showed broad regions of near\n26\n\n\fzero phase response combined with steep changes in sensitivity in other regions, going\nfrom zero to peak phase response in an interval corresponding to about 10% of the\nlimit cycle duration (c.f. Figure 6 of [55]). Preliminary data obtained from the marine\nmollusk Aplysia californica during feeding behavior show extended, variable dwell\ntimes in preferred regions of phase space separated by rapid transitions from region to\nregion [44], suggesting the possibility that this central pattern generator's dynamics\nmay resemble that of a limit cycle making close encounters with multiple unstable\nfixed points.\nThe infinitesimal PRC is equal to the gradient of the asymptotic phase function\nevaluated at the limit cycle. For the iris system, the level curves appear to pinch\ntogether at the boundaries where they abruptly change direction, and this pinching means the density of the level curves is highest at the square boundaries. One\nmight naively expect that the phase response should be most sensitive to perturbations immediately adjacent to the saddle points; instead the peak sensitivity occurs\nat boundaries between regions dominated by one or another saddle. This effect is\nqualitatively present both in the piecewise linear iris system and in the smooth system considered here. Within the piecewise linear regions of the iris system the flow is\nhomogeneous; it is the boundaries that make the system nonlinear and it should not\nbe surprising that that is where the greatest sensitivity occurs. In the sine system,\nit appears that near the saddles the flow is governed by the local linear approximation, while in the region between saddles the flow is \"more nonlinear\" coinciding with\ngreater sensitivity to perturbation.\n8.2. Comparison to the PRC near a homoclinic bifurcation. While the\nstructure and asymptotic behavior of the phase response curve described in Theorem\n1 were derived specifically for the iris system, we expect the qualitative picture to\nhold for generic one-parameter families of limit cycles verging on a heteroclinic or\na homoclinic bifurcation of C 1 vector fields as well. Treating the general case lies\nbeyond the scope of this paper; however, it will be useful to compare our results with\nthe analysis of phase resetting near a homoclinic bifurcation given in ([11], S3.1.3).\nIn [11] the authors consider a vector field on Rn with a hyperbolic saddle fixed\npoint at the origin with a single unstable eigenvalue \u03bbu and unstable eigenvalues \u03bbs,j\nwith \u03bbu < \u03bbs = minj [\u03bbs,j ]. For positive values of a bifurcation parameter \u03bc, the\nsystem is assumed to have a limit cycle that spends the overwhelming majority of its\ntime in a box B = [0, \u2206]n . Trajectories exit the box when the coordinate along the\nunstable eigendirection x = \u2206 and are instantaneously reinjected with x = \u03b5. When\nn = 2 the geometry is similar to that of the iris system (compare Figure 3 of [11] with\nour Figure 2.1b). The main difference is that in the homoclinic system, the value of\nthe injection point along the unstable limit coordinate is assumed to be independent\nof the egress point, whereas in the iris system its dependence is specified by the map\nh = fe \u2218 fl (Figure 3.1). Equivalently, it is as if the derivative of the function h were\nzero at the fixed point u\u2020 rather than having finite slope. This situation would occur\nfor the homoclinic system if the compression of the flow taking trajectories from the\negress boundary to the ingress boundary were sufficiently great. However, in analyzing\nthe homoclinic system, one must also assume that the time spent along the portion of\nthe limit cycle outside the box B is vanishingly small. Reconciling these two limiting\nprocesses for the general homoclinic case remains an interesting problem.\nFor purposes of comparison, note that \u03b5/\u2206 in [11] corresponds to u\u2020 for the iris\nsystem, and the phase \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) in [11] corresponds to 2\u03c0\u03c6 in the iris system. Table\n8.1 compares the infinitesimal PRCs for the two systems.

For clarity, we write u, 0 < u < 1, for u\u2020 = \u03b5/\u2206, and the phase 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1 for\nboth systems. Here s = u\u03bb ; in the \u03bb \u2192 \u221e limit s \u2192 0, and the systems coincide (up\nto a scaling factor \u03bdx /\u2206 related to the choice of perturbation direction). The iPRC\nfor perturbations parallel to the unstable (resp. stable) eigenvector direction is given\nby Zu (resp. Zs ).\n\nis assumed to be in a particular direction corresponding to a voltage deflection in\na neural model; the factor \u03bdx arises in the change of coordinates from the direction\nof voltage peturbations relative to the unstable eigenvector direction. The flow is\nassumed to be infinitely compressive during the time between egress and reinjection,\nand consequently it is assumed that only components of the perturbation along the\nunstable eigendirection contribute to the iPRC. This assumption holds for the iris\nsystem in the limit as the unstable-to-stable eigenvalue ratio \u03bbu /\u03bbs = \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, but\nnot for finite values of \u03bb. The \u03bb < \u221e case includes additional corrections; see Table\n8.1.\nFinally, assuming that the phase response is independent of displacement along\nthe stable eigenvector direction is equivalent to assuming that the isochrons run parallel to the stable eigenvector throughout the box B. For the iris system the slopes\nof the isochrons do approach zero as \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, becoming more and more parallel to\nthe stable eigenvector, but for \u03bb = \u221e the asymptotic phase and the isochrons are no\nlonger well defined. For finite values of \u03bb the isochrons are well defined, but are not\nparallel to the stable eigenvector. Compare the isochrons in the SW quadrant of the\niris system shown in Figure 6.1.\n8.3. Phase resetting in the absence of an asymptotic phase. Deterministic limit cycles are not the only way to represent (approximately) periodic biological\nrhythms. Alternatives include heteroclinic or homoclinic attractors perturbed by\nsmall amplitude noise [8, 49] as well as fixed points of spiral sink type subject to\nsmall noisy perturbations [10, 31]. A system comprising a determinstic flow with a\nstable spiral fixed point, when perturbed by small to modest amounts of noise, will\nshow noisy oscillatory trajectories that can be difficult to distinguish from a small\namplitude limit cycle [10]. For example, the small oscillations in membrane potential\nof a nerve cell brought near to firing by a steady depolarizing current of modest size\nmay be due either to \"noisy spiral sink\" dynamics or to \"noisy small limit cycle\"\ndynamics [46]. The classical definition of asymptotic phase breaks down for noisy systems, for spiral sinks, and for heteroclinic or homoclinic orbits. Nevertheless \"phase\nresetting\" is actively studied in such systems both experimentally [21, 22, 46, 47] and\ntheoretically [29, 40, 39]. For the Bonhoeffer\u2013van der Pol equations, for example,\nRabinovitch and colleagues showed how to define an analog of the classical isochron,\nfor point converging to a spiral sink along a distinguished trajectory (a \"T-attractor\")\n[40]. Generally speaking, noise effects can expose the structure of bifurcations in neu28\n\n\fral systems through stochastic resonance [24] or spike time bifurcations [52, 53], and\nit would be useful to have a broader theory of \"phase response\" going beyond the\ncase of deterministic limit cycles.\n9.
