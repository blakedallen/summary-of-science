Kreimera\u2217\na\n\nCNRS-IHES\n35 rte. de Chartres, F-91440 Bures-sur-Yvette, France\nWe discuss factorization of the Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations using the Lie- and Hopf algebra of graphs. The\nstructure of those equations allows to introduce a commutative associative product on 1PI graphs. In scalar\nfield theories, this product vanishes if and only if one of the factors vanishes. Gauge theories are more subtle:\nintegrality relates to gauge symmetries.\n\n1. The Lie and Hopf algebra of graphs\nOver recent years, the Lie and Hopf algebra\nstructures of Feynman graphs have been firmly\nestablished in collaboration with Alain Connes\nand David Broadhurst [1\u201311]. Hopefully, they\nfind their way now into the algorithmic toolkit\nof the practitioner of QFT. They directly address\nthe computational practice of momentum space\nFeynman integrals, but can be equivalently formulated in coordinate space. They take into account faithfully the self-similarity of physics at\ndifferent scales and the iteration of Green functions in terms of itself by their quantum equations\nof motions, the Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations. We\nwill review quickly these Lie and Hopf algebra\nstructures and then report in the next section on\nfactorization properties which exist in the formal\nseries over graphs contributing to a given Green\nfunction. We motivate this factorization in comparison with the factorization of integers leading\nto an Euler product for \u03b6-functions, and comment\non the fate of such factorizations in gauge theories. Results reported here can also be found in\n[12], which in particular contains a more extended\ndiscussion of factorization properties and their\nimplications on perturbative expansions with regard to the question if the factorization commutes\nwith the application of the Feynman rules. We\nstart our summary with the pre-Lie structure.\n\n\u2217 supported\n\nin parts by NSF grant 0205977; Ctr. Math.\nPhys. at Boston U., BUCMP/02-06\n\n1.1. The Pre-Lie Structure\nA 1PI Feynman graph \u03931 provides internal\nedges and vertices. Each internal vertex v has\na set of edges fv attached to it. A vertex correc[1]\ntion graph \u03932 has a set of external edges \u03932,ext\nattached to it. If those two sets agree, we can\nglue \u03932 into \u03931 at v, where we sum over all these\npossible bijections between fv and \u039312,ext , and normalize such that topologically different graphs are\ngenerated precisely once. Furthermore, we formally define this insertion to vanish when the two\nsets do not agree. Summing over all places v in\n\u03931 gives a bilinear map \u2217 from 1PI graphs to 1PI\ngraphs. It can be extended to insertions of selfenergies into edges in the obvious manner [5,7].\nOne then has:\nTheorem 1 [5,1,7] The operation \u2217 is pre-Lie:\n[\u03931 \u2217 \u03932 ] \u2217 \u03933\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03931 \u2217 [\u03932 \u2217 \u03933 ]\n\n= [\u03931 \u2217 \u03933 ] \u2217 \u03932\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03931 \u2217 [\u03933 \u2217 \u03932 ].\n\n(1)\n\nThe theorem says that the lack of associativity in\nthe bilinear operation \u2217 is invariant under permutation of the elements indexed 2, 3. This suffices\nto show that the antisymmetrization of this map\nfulfils a Jacobi identity. Hence we get a Lie algebra L by antisymmetrizing this operation:\n[\u03931 , \u03932 ] = \u03931 \u2217 \u03932 \u2212 \u03932 \u2217 \u03931 ,\n\n(2)\n\nand a Hopf algebra H as the dual of the universal enveloping algebra of this Lie algebra [5,4].\nWe restrict attention to graphs which are superficially divergent, while superficially convergent\ngraphs can be incorporated in a trivial manner\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 2. Examples for coproducts \u2206(\u0393) in various theories: i) \u03c636 , ii) \u03c644 , iii) QED.\nFigure 1. Examples of Lie brackets in various\ntheories: i) \u03c636 graphs, ii) \u03c644 graphs, iii) QED\ngraphs.\n\n[5]. Fig.(1) gives Lie brackets for various different theories.\n1.2. The principle of multiplicative subtraction\nThe beauty of the existence of these graded\ncombinatorial Lie algebras is that they make the\nrole of locality manifest. We dualize the universal enveloping algebra U(L) of L and obtain a\ncommutative, non-cocommutative Hopf algebra\nH [5]. To find this dual, one uses a Kronecker\npairing and constructs it in accordance with the\nMilnor-Moore theorem [5,7,4].\n1PI graphs are the linear generators of the\nHopf algebra, with their disjoint union furnishing a commutative product in the algebra. We\nthen identify the Hopf algebra by a coproduct\n\u2206 : H \u2192 H \u2297 H:\nX\n\u2206(\u0393) = \u0393 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 \u0393 +\n\u03b3 \u2297 \u0393/\u03b3,\n(3)\n\u03b3\u2282\u0393\n\nthe sum is over all unions of one-particle irreducible (1PI) superficially divergent proper subgraphs. We extend this definition to products of\ngraphs so that we get a bialgebra. The above\nsum should, when needed, also run over appropriate projections to formfactors, to specify the\nappropriate type of local insertion [5] which appear in local counterterms, which we omitted in\nthe above sum for simplicity. Fig.(2) gives exam-\n\nples.\nWe still need a counit and antipode (coinverse):\nthe counit \u0113 vanishes on any non-trivial Hopf algebra element, \u0113(1) = 1, \u0113(X) = 0. At this stage\nwe have a commutative, but typically not cocommutative bialgebra. It actually is a Hopf algebra\nas the antipode (coinverse) in such circumstances\ncomes for free as\nX\nS(\u0393) = \u2212\u0393 \u2212\nS(\u03b3)\u0393/\u03b3.\n(4)\n\u03b3\u2282\u0393\n\nThose ingredients give us a group structure on\nany multiplicative map from the Hopf algebra to\nsome ring or algebra V : the co-unit, -product,\n-inverse give us a unit, product and inverse on\nsuch maps.\nAs physicists, we have a distinguished such\nmap, (momentum-space) Feynman rules \u03c6 : H \u2192\nV from the Hopf algebra of graphs H into an appropriate space V , of, say, Laurent polynomials\nin the dimensional regularization parameter \u03b5.\nWe will have to make one further choice: a\nrenormalization scheme. For us, this is a map\nR : V \u2192 V faithful on short distance singularities, which furthermore obeys\nR(xy) + R(x)R(y) = R(R(x)y) + R(xR(y)), (5)\nan equation which guarantees the multiplicativity of renormalization and is at the heart of the\nBirkhoff decomposition of [5,6].\nRenormalization theory emerges as a principle\nof multiplicative subtraction: we define a further\n\u03c6\nwhich deforms \u03c6 \u25e6 S slightly and\ncharacter SR\n\n\f3\ndelivers the counterterm for \u0393 in the renormalization scheme R:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX\nS \u03c6 (\u0393) = \u2212R[\u03c6(\u0393)] \u2212 R \uf8f0\nS \u03c6 (\u03b3)\u03c6(\u0393/\u03b3)\uf8fb (6)\nR\n\nR\n\n\u03b3\u2282\u0393\n\nwhich should be compared with the undeformed\nX\n\u03c6 \u25e6 S = \u2212\u03c6(\u0393) \u2212\n\u03c6 \u25e6 S(\u03b3)\u03c6(\u0393/\u03b3).\n(7)\n\u03b3\u2282\u0393\n\nWe obtain the renormalization of \u0393 by the application of a renormalized character\n\u03c6\n\u0393 \u2192 SR\n\u22c6 \u03c6(\u0393)\n\nand Bogoliubov's R\u0304 operation as\nX \u03c6\nR\u0304(\u0393) = \u03c6(\u0393) +\nSR (\u03b3)\u03c6(\u0393/\u03b3),\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nSR\n\u22c6 \u03c6(\u0393) = R\u0304(\u0393) + SR\n(\u0393).\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b3\u2282\u0393\n\n2.1.

Factorization\nThere is a connection between Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations and Euler products [12]. To motivate it let us start with the Riemann \u03b6 function, and obtain it as a solution to a Dyson\u2013\nSchwinger equation, as in [12]. This is only meant\nas a sufficient stimulus to invert the reasoning\nand look for Euler products in quantum field theory. This whole section is meant to inspire an\ninvestigation of the question how such factorizations of Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations actually fare\nwhen we apply Feynman rules or related characters to Euler products, a question addressing\nthe transition from the perturbative to the nonperturbative [12]. It will be discussed in detail in\nupcoming work of the author.\n\n(11)\n\nwith \u2206(1) = 1 \u2297 1 and we identify 1 with the\nempty sequence. Define the value w(J) to be the\nproduct of the entries of J, and let the symmetry\nfactor S(J) be the number of sequences which\nhave the same value, which simply is k! if the\nsequence has length l(J) = k.

This allows to write the unknown Green\nfunction as a sum over all possible images over\nall closed Hochschild one-cocycles in the theory\n[12,13], precisely provided by the primitive bidegree one graphs \u03b3, which play the role of primes.\n2.2. Factorizing graphs\nCan a factorization into Euler products be\nfound in quantum field theory? And if it can be\nfound at the combinatorial level, will the evaluation, by the Feynman rules, equal the product of\nthe evaluations, and, if not, how will it deviate?\nA typical Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation is of the\nform [12]\nX \u03b3\nX =1+\nB+ (g k [\u222ak X]),\n(20)\n\u03b3\n\nwhere the infinite sum in the Hopf algebra is over\nprimitive graphs \u03b3, k = k(\u03b3) is the loop-degree\n\nFigure 3. Examples of \u2228-products in various theories: i) \u03c636 , ii) \u03c644 , iii) QED. In these simple examples, they correspond just to a symmetrization\ninstead of an antisymmetrization of the pre-Lie\ninsertion. The general definition is given in [12].\n\n\u03b3\nof \u03b3, and as the notation indicates, the maps B+\nare closed Hochschild one-cocycles, and the sum\nis over all of those [12,4]. X is an infinite sum of\ngraphs contributing to a chosen Green function,\nand evaluation by the Feunman rules delivers the\nusual Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations given as an integral equation over the kernels provided by the\nprimitive graphs \u03b3. Note that, as insertion into\na primitive graph commutes with the coproduct\nin the desired way, we can directly read-off the\nrenormalized Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation as\nX \u03b3\nXR = Z X +\nB+ (g k [\u222ak XR ]),\n(21)\n\u03b3\n\nwhere the Z-factor ZX is the negative part in the\nBirkhoff decomposition with respect to a renormalization scheme R, as usual.\nThe first question to ask is: is there a combinatorial Euler product for the formal sum over\ngraphs generated by such an equation? The answer is indeed affirmative.\nThe crucial step lies in the definition of an associative product \u2228 which generalizes the shuffle product \u2294 appropriate for totally ordered sequences to the partial order given by being a subgraph [12]. We simply describe it in Fig.(3).\nThen, we have\nQ\u2228\n1\n,\nTheorem 2 X(g) = \u03b3 1\u2212gk(\u03b3)\n\u03b3\n\n\f5\nthe proof of which is to be given elsewhere.\nHere is not the space to discuss the fascinating\nquestion of how much we can say about\n!\n\u2228\nY\nY\n1\n1\nvs\n= \u03b6G (\u03c6) ?\n\u03c6\n1\u2212\u03b3\n1 \u2212 \u03c6(\u03b3)\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nA discussion of this question was started in [12],\nand answers are in preparation. Note that such\nfactorization suggest pseudo-exponentiations of\ntranscendentals in the Taylor expansion of skeleton graphs in the dimensional regularization parameter, as reported by David Broadhurst at this\nconference [14].\n2.3. Gauge symmetries\nFinally, let us mention a first simple example\nas to how basic algebraic structures relating to\nsuch factorizations in Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations\nrelate to physical properties of a theory. Let \u03b3vp\ndenote the one-loop vacuum-polarization in QED,\nand more generally let {\u0393N\u2212A } be the set of 1PI\ngraphs in a non-abelian gauge theory which have\nas external lines two or more gauge bosons and\nsuch that the three-valent fermion-boson vertex\nis the only type of vertex which appears in them.\nThey hence all have at least one fermion loop.\nProposition 3 i) The product \u03931 \u2228 \u03932 is integral\nfor 1PI graphs in \u03c636 and \u03c644 .\nii) It is non-integral for gauge theories:\n\u03931 \u2228\u03932 = 0 \u21d2 \u03931 = 0 or \u03932 = 0 or \u03931 = \u03932 = \u03b3vp\n(QED);\n\u03931 \u2228 \u03932 = 0 \u21d2 \u03931 = 0 or \u03932 = 0 or \u03931 , \u03932 \u2208\n{\u0393N\u2212A } (non-abelian case).\nProof: i) Each 1PI graph with one or more loops\ncontains internal edges and vertices. As these\ntheories are renormalizable and we restrict the\nHopf algebra to superficially divergent graphs,\nthe product \u2228, symmetrizing over insertions of superficially divergent graphs into each other, will\nnot vanish. ii) QED: the one-loop vacuum polarization has two internal fermion propagators and\ntwo internal vertices, but no internal photon line.\nBut it is itself a self-energy graph for the photon.\nIts \u2228-product with itself hence vanishes. Each\nother QED graph \u0393 has internal vertices, fermion\nlines and photon lines, so that \u0393 \u2228 \u03b3 = 0 implies\n\n\u03b3 = 0. For the non-abelian case, this argument\nhas a natural generalization to the indicated set\nof graphs, and relates to questions of uniqueness\nof factorization [13].\nThis relates integrality of the \u2228-product to\ngauge/BRST symmetries. For example, the Hopf\nalgebra of QED graphs can be divided by an appropriate ideal of graphs such that the quotient\nconsists of graphs free of one-loop vacuumpolarization subgraphs, and this quotient turns out to\nbe equivalent to the ideal generated by the Ward\nidentities. This deserves a much more detailed\ndiscussion again to be given elsewhere.\nREFERENCES\n1. D. Kreimer, Adv. Theor. Math. Phys. 2\n(1998) 303[q-alg/9707029].\n2. D. Kreimer, Adv. Theor. Math.
