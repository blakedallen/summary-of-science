A liquid crystal is a phase of a material between the solid and liquid\nphases. The solid phase has strong intermolecular forces that keep the molecular position\nand orientation fixed, while in the liquid phase, the molecules neither occupy a specific\naverage position nor do they remain in any particular orientation; the liquid crystal phase\ndoes not have any positional order, but does possess a certain amount of orientational order.\nThis phase is described by a velocity field, as well as a director field that describes locally\nthe averaged direction or orientation of the constituent molecules. In this paper, we shall\nDate: Oct. 1, 2000; current version October 23, 2018.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35Q30, 35Q72, 58J35.\nKey words and phrases. Navier-Stokes, Ginzburg-Landau, Liquid Crystals, Global Attractors.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSTEVE SHKOLLER\n\nanalyze the behavior of a certain model of nematic liquid crystals on compact Riemannian\nmanifolds.\nWe let (M, g) denote a smooth, compact, connected, n-dimensional Riemannian manifold\nwith smooth (possibly empty) boundary \u2202M . If \u2202M = \u2205, then we assume that the Euler\ncharacteristic \u03c7(M ) does not vanish. We study the following system of nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations:\nut + \u2207u u = \u2212 grad p + \u03bd Div Def u \u2212 \u03bb Div(\u2207dT * \u2207d) ,\n\n(1.1a)\n\ndiv u(t, x) = 0 ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\n\u02c6 \u2212 (|d| \u2212 1)d ,\ndt + \u2207u d = \u03b3 \u2206d\n\u01eb2\nu = 0 on \u2202M, d = h on \u2202M g(h, h) = 1 or \u2202M = \u2205 ,\n\n(1.1b)\n\nu(0, x) = u0 , d(0, x) = d0 and d0 |\u2202M = h if \u2202M 6= \u2205.\n\n(1.1e)\n\n(1.1c)\n(1.1d)\n\nHere u(t, x) and d(t, x) are time-dependent vector fields on M , \u2207 denotes the Levi-Civita\ncovariant derivative associated to the Riemannian metric g, Def u = 12 (\u2207u + \u2207uT ) denotes\n\u02c6 denotes the\nthe (rate of) deformation tensor, the superscript (*)T denotes the transpose, \u2206\nrough Laplacian of g defined in (2.4), and \u03bd, \u03bb, \u03b3 are positive constants. In the case that M is\nflat, an open subset of Euclidean space for instance, then \u2207 is the componentwise gradient,\n\u22022\n\u02c6 is the componentwise Laplacian given in coordinates xi by \u2206\n\u02c6 = Pn\nand \u2206\ni=1 \u2202xi \u2202xi . The\nsystem of equations (1.1) is the simplified Ericksen-Leslie model [6, 7, 9] of nematic liquid\ncrystals first introduced by F.H. Lin in [10] and later analyzed by F.H. Lin and C. Liu in\n[11, 12]. Beautiful numerical simulations can be found in [16].\nThis system couples the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with the Ginzburg-Landau (GL)\npenalization of the harmonic map heat flow. The vector field u(t, x) is the velocity field of\nthe fluid, while d(t, x) is the penalized (Ginzburg-Landau) approximation to the unit-length\ndirector field, representing the orientation parameter of the nematic liquid-crystal.\nThe parameter \u01eb > 0 is the penalization parameter, \u03bd denotes the kinematic viscosity of\nthe fluid, \u03bb is an elastic constant, and \u03b3 is the relaxation-time parameter.\nThe coupling term Div(\u2207dT *\u2207d) preserves the regularity of the Navier-Stokes equations:\nwhen velocity u = 0, (1.1a) becomes Div(\u2207dT * \u2207d) = \u2212 grad p, so that when dt = 0, d\nis a solution of the static portion of (1.1c) together with the constraint Div(\u2207dT * \u2207d) =\n\u2212 grad p. This constraint pushes the gradient flow towards a \"regular\" (H s , s sufficiently\nlarge) stationary solution. Even though the coupling term has two derivatives, analytically,\nit is essentially identical to the advection term \u2207u u.\nResults. We begin by extending the simplified Ericksen-Leslie model of F.H. Lin to a\ncompact Riemannian manifold with boundary. This extension introduces a new curvature\nterm in the basic energy laws, and provides a covariant (coordinate-independent) description\nof the liquid crystal dynamics. Motion on the sphere is an important application.\nIn Section 2, we prove that the system of equations (1.1) actually arises from a simple\nvariational principle (the system was originally derived using balance laws). The variational\nprinciple is the key to our analysis, for it gives the correct scaling; namely, it shows that when\nd is taken to have one derivative greater regularity than u, the liquid crystal system behaves\nas if it were parabolic, a fact which was not previously known (see [11]). In fact, according\nto [14], because the interaction term Div(\u2207dT * \u2207d) formally has as many derivatives as the\n\n\fLIQUID CRYSTALS ON RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS\n\n3\n\ndiffusion term, the standard Galerkin procedure for obtaining local solutions had failed in\nprior attempts.\nIn Section 3, we give a very simple proof of local well-posedness of the system (1.1) on\n(M, g) (in Theorems 1 and 2) using the contraction mapping theorem; this significantly\nsimplifies the clever, but lengthy, modified Galerkin procedure employed by Lin and Liu in\n[11]. Moreover, the proof does not require use of either the maximum principle or higherorder energy laws.\nIn Section 4, we show (in Propositions 1, 2, and 3) that on two-dimensional Riemannian\nmanifolds with smooth boundary (possibly empty), there exists an absorbing set for u in\nH 1 and d in H 2 .\nIn Section 5, we prove the global well-posedness of the system (1.1), as well as the\nexistence of absorbing sets for u in H s and d in H s+1 , and hence of a compact global\nattractor when the dimension is n = 2 (see Theorems 3 and 4). When \u2202M = \u2205 brute-force\nenergy estimates may be computed, but when \u2202M is not empty, we use the Ladyzhenskaya\nmethod to obtain the uniform bounds. We remark that the existence of global attractors\nfor this system was not previously known. We also remark that since the Navier-Stokes\nequations are a subsystem of (1.1), one does not expect to be able to prove results in\ndimension three which do not already exist for the Navier-Stokes equations; namely, the\nproblem of unique classical solutions remains open, while weak solutions exist [11].\nFinally, in Section 6, we introduce the Lagrangian averaged liquid crystal equations (6.6).\nThis system is based on the Lagrangian averaged Navier-Stokes equations (see [17] and references therein), and is derived by averaging the Navier-Stokes flow over small spatial scales\nwhich are smaller than some positive small number \u03b1. We show that this averaged system\nretains the structure of the original system derived by Lin in the form of averaged energy\nlaws, but has the advantage of being globally well-posed on three-dimensional domains (see\nTheorem 5). The averaged energy law shows that when both the fluid flow is averaged\ntogether with the director field, both u and d scale similarly, and d is not required to have\none-derivative greater regularity. Of course, physically, it seems much more natural to us\nto average the fluid flow, since the molecular orientation is already an averaged quantity.\nWe believe that the averaged liquid crystal system will be the ideal model for numerical\ncomputation.\nSome Notation and Interpolation Inequalities. We shall use the notation H s (T M ) to\ndenote the H s -class vector fields on the manifold M . The H s (T M ) inner-product is given,\nin any local chart, by\ns\nX\nhD \u03b1 u, D \u03b1 vi,\nhu, vis =\n|\u03b1|=0\n\nwhere\n\nhu, vi =\n\nZ\n\ng(x) (u(x), v(x)) \u03bc(x)\nM\n\ndenotes the L2 inner-product, \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n ) is a multi-index, and\n|\u03b1| = \u03b11 + * * * + \u03b1n ,\n\nD \u03b1 = \u22021\u03b11 * * * \u2202n\u03b1n .\n\nWe shall denote the H s (T M ) norm by\n|u|s = hu, uis ,\n\n\f4\n\nSTEVE SHKOLLER\n\nh*, *i = h*, *i0 , and | * | = | * |0 . We set H01 (T M ) to consist of those vector fields in H 1 (T M )\nwhich have zero trace on \u2202M . Similarly, vectors in Hh1 (T M ) have trace h on \u2202M .

The Variational Principle\nIn this section, we shall explain how the system of equations (1.1) arise from a simple\nvariational principle, (1.1a) being the first variation of the action with respect to the Lagrangian flow variable, and (1.1c) being the L2 gradient flow of the first variation of the\naction with respect to the director field. It was not previously known that (1.1) can be\nobtained from a variational principle; rather, balance arguments were invoked to derive the\nmodel.\nWe let \u03b7(t, x) denote the Lagrangian flow variable, a solution of the differential equation\n\u2202t \u03b7(t, x) = u(t, \u03b7(t, x),\n\n\u03b7(0, x) = x.\n\nC 0 (I, W s ),\n\nFor I = [0, T ], and each t \u2208 I, u \u2208\ns > (n/2) + 2, the map \u03b7(t, *) : M \u2192 M\ns\nis an H volume-preserving diffeomorphism with H s inverse, and restricts to the identity\ns .

As a consequence of the\ns , we may compute the kinetic\nright-invariance of S with respect to the lifted action of D\u03bc,D\nenergy of the fluid as well as the elastic energy along the particle trajectory \u03b7(t, x).

The\npenalization was motivated by the study of harmonic maps of simply-connected domains \u03a9\ninto spheres (see [2]); in particular, the space Hh1 (\u03a9, S1 ) = \u2205 when | degree(h)| \u2265 1 so that\nonly infinite energy minimizers exist. As a fix for this problem, the penalization method is\ninvoked, which enlarges the space of potential minimizers to Hh1 (\u03a9, R2 ) (which is obviously\nnot empty) and simultaneously imposes the unit-length constraint.\nTo compute the first variation of S with respect to \u03b7, we let \u03b5 7\u2192 \u03c6\u03b5 be a smooth curve\ns\nin D\u03bc,D\nsuch that \u03c60 = e, and (d/d\u03b5)|\u03b5=0 \u03c6\u03b5 = w \u2208 W s .

We use D1 and D2 to\ndenote the Frech\u00e9t derivatives of S with respect to \u03b7 and d, respectively. Integrating by\nparts, and using the fact that \u2202t \u03b7 = u \u25e6 \u03b7 and that \u03b7 has Jacobian determinant equal to\none, we see that\nZ Z\ng(\u03b7(t, x)) (\u2212((D/dt)\u2202t \u03b7(t, x), w(t, \u03b7(t, x)) dx dt\nhD1 S(\u03b7, d), \u03b4\u03b7i =\nI M\nZ Z\ng(y) ((D/d\u03b5)|\u03b5=0 \u2207d \u25e6 \u03c6\u03b5 (y) * T \u03c6\u03b5 (y), \u2207d(t, y)) dy dt\n+\nZI ZM\ng(y) ((\u2212ut (t, y) \u2212 \u2207u u(t, y) \u2212 grad p(t, y), w(t, y)) dy dt\n=\nI M\nZ Z\n{g(y) (\u2207w (\u2207d), \u2207d) + g(y) (\u2207d(t, y) * \u2207w, \u2207d)} dy dt\n+\nI M\nZ Z\ng(y) ((\u2212ut (t, y) \u2212 \u2207u u(t, y) \u2212 grad p(t, y), w(t, y)) dy dt\n=\nI M\nZ Z\n\u0001\ng(y) \u2212 Div(\u2207dT * \u2207d), w dy dt,\n+\nI\n\nM\n\nwhere the last equality follows from the fact that h\u2207w (\u2207d), \u2207di = 0, since div w = 0.

Thus (1.1a) follows as the first variation of the action\nfunction S with respect to \u03b7. Equation (1.1b) follows immediately from the fact that \u03b7 is\nvolume-preserving.\nLetting d\u03b5 = d + \u03b5\u03b4d, a much simpler computation verifies that\nZ Z\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\n\u03b5\n\u02c6 \u2212 f (d), \u03b4d dy dt,\ng(y) \u2206d\nS(\u03b7, d ) =\nhD2 S(\u03b7, d), \u03b4di =\nd\u03b5 \u03b5=0\nI M\nwhere\n\n\u02c6 = \u2207\u2217 \u2207\n\u2206d\n\n(2.4)\n\nis the rough Laplacian and \u2207\u2217 is the L2 formal adjoint of the covariant derivative \u2207.

We keep the same notation as in the proof of Theorem 1.

The fact that d 7\u2192 f (d) : H s+1 \u2192 H 1 follows because\nH s+1 forms a Schauder ring. Hence, \u03a6 is indeed locally Lipschitz, and the remainder of the\nproof is identical to the one for Theorem 1.\n4.

Lagrangian averaged liquid crystals\nAs we described in the introduction, the director field d describes locally the averaged\ndirection of the constituent molecules; it is thus reasonable, and of practical and computational importance, to locally average the Navier-Stokes fluid motion as well. Recently, the\nLagrangian averaged Navier-Stokes (LANS) equations were introduced as a model for the\nlarge scale Navier-Stokes fluid motion which averages or filters over the small, computationally unresolvable spatial scales (see [17] and the references therein). The LANS equations\nare parameterized by a small spatial scale \u03b1 > 0 \u2013 fluid motion at spatial scales smaller than\n\u03b1 is averaged or filtered-out. There are two types of Lagrangian averaged Navier-Stokes\nequations: the isotropic and the anisotropic versions. We shall begin with the isotropic\ntheory, and for simplicity of presentation, we shall assume that M is flat.\nThe isotropic LANS equations for the mean velocity u(t, x) are given by\n\u2202t (1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2206)u + \u2207u (1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2206)u \u2212 \u03b12 \u2207uT * \u25b3u = \u2212 grad p + \u03bd(1 \u2212 \u03b12\u2206)\u2206u\n\n(6.1a)\n\ndiv u(t, x) = 0 ,\n\n(6.1b)\n\nu = 0 on \u2202M ,\n\n(6.1c)\n\nu(0, x) = u0 .\n\n(6.1d)\n\nEquation (6.1a) has an equivalent representation as\n\u2202t u + \u2207u u + U \u03b1 (u) = \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2206)\u22121 grad p + \u03bd\u2206u\n\u0002\n\u0003\nU \u03b1 (u) = \u03b12 (1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2206)\u22121 Div \u2207u * \u2207uT + \u2207u * \u2207u \u2212 \u2207uT * \u2207u .\n\n(6.2a)\n(6.2b)\n\n\fLIQUID CRYSTALS ON RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS\n\n19\n\nWhen \u2202M = \u2205 the LANS equations take on a particularly familiar \"sub-grid-stress\" form\nwith (6.2) becoming\n\u2202t u + \u2207u u + Div \u03c4 \u03b1 (u) = \u2212 grad p + \u03bd\u2206u\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c4 \u03b1 (u) = \u03b12 (1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2206)\u22121 \u2207u * \u2207uT + \u2207u * \u2207u \u2212 \u2207uT * \u2207u ,\n\n(6.3a)\n(6.3b)\n\nwhere \u03c4 \u03b1 representing the sub-grid or \"Reynolds stress.\"\nThe remarkable feature of the LANS equations is that, unlike the Reynolds averaged\nNavier-Stokes (RANS) equations or Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models of turbulence,\nno additional dissipation is put into the system. In fact, when \u03bd = 0, the LANS equations\nconserve the Hamiltonian structure of the Euler equations with both a modified kinetic\nenergy\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b1\n|u|2 + 2\u03b12 | Def u|2 \u03bc\n(6.4)\nE =\n2 M\nand helicity\n\n\u03b1\n\nH =\n\nZ\n\nw \u2227 dw,\n\nw = (1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2206)u\u266d , u\u266d = g(u, *),\n\n(6.5)\n\nM\n\nbeing conserved.\nThis is easiest to see from equation (6.3), where the only term that is added (to the\nNS equations) is Div \u03c4 \u03b1 (u); it is precisely this term which averages the small scales, and\nthis is accomplished by the use of nonlinear dispersion as opposed to dissipation. A simple\ncomputation, which requires taking the L2 inner-product of the LANS equations with u\nwhen \u03bd is set to zero, shows that (6.4) is conserved. Why is it so important not to overdissipate the NS equations? The answer is twofold: first, the addition of artificial dissipation\nobviously and spuriously removes crucial small-scale features, and second, artificial viscosity,\nwhich is present in RANS or LES models, suppresses intermittency, a fundamental feature\nof fluid turbulence.\nMathematically, for all \u03b1 > 0, the three-dimensional LANS equations are globally wellposed (see [18]), yet when the averaging parameter \u03b1 is taken sufficiently small, computational simulations of LANS are statistically indistinguishable from the simulations of the\nNS equations. Furthermore, the LANS equations provide a tremendous computational savings as shown in simulations of both forced and decaying turbulence ([3], [19]). Finally, the\nLANS equations arise from a variational principle in the same fashion as the NS equations.\nWe shall therefore base our development of the averaged liquid crystal equations on the\nLANS model, and introduce the following system of equations:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nut \u2212 \u03bd\u2206u + \u2207u u \u2212 U \u03b1 (u) = \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2206)\u22121 grad p + Div(\u2207dT * \u2207d) ,\n(6.6a)\ndiv u(t, x) = 0 ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\ndt + \u2207u d = \u03b3 \u2206d \u2212 2 (|d|2 \u2212 1)d ,\n\u01eb\nu = 0 on \u2202M, d = h on \u2202M g(h, h) = 1 or \u2202M = \u2205 ,\n\n(6.6b)\n\nu(0, x) = u0 , d(0, x) = d0 and d0 |\u2202M = h if \u2202M 6= \u2205 ,\n\n(6.6e)\n\nwhere \u2206 denotes the componentwise Laplacian.\n\n(6.6c)\n(6.6d)\n\n\f20\n\nSTEVE SHKOLLER\n\nAveraged Variational Principle.

Note,\nhowever, that now u is the mean velocity, and it is the mean flow \u03b7 which is transporting\nthe director field d.\nAveraged Energy Law. For simplicity, we shall present the formulation in the case that\n\u2202M = \u2205, although the more general case follows in the same fashion as we presented above.\nFollowing the notation of Section 2, we have the following basic averaged energy law:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1 d\n2\n2\n2\n2\nF (d)\u03bc\n|u| + \u03b1 |\u2207u| + \u03bb|\u2207d| + 2\n2 dt\nM\n\u0001\n\u2264 \u2212\u03bd |\u2207u|2 + \u03b12 |\u2206u|2 \u2212 \u03b3\u03bb|\u2206d \u2212 f (d)|2 .\n(6.8)\n\nFrom Lemma 3 and (6.8), it follows that there exists t\u0304 > 0 and some \u03c1\u03040 > 0 which are\nindependent of the initial data such that\n|u(t, *)|21 + |d|21 \u2264 \u03c1\u03040\n\n\u2200t > t\u0304.\n\nWe see that the averaged energy law is, in some sense, more natural than the standard basic\nenergy law (4.1) since the director field d is no longer constrained to have one derivative\ngreater regularity than the velocity of the fluid u: both u and d now scale similarly.\nBecause of the a priori uniform bound of u(t, *) in W 1 , it is very easy to obtain an a priori\nbound for u(t, *) in W 2 and d \u2208 H 2 (T M ) when the dim(M ) = 3. We simply compute the\nsum\n0 = h(1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2206)(6.6a), (1 \u2212 \u03b12 )ui + h\u2206(6.6c), \u2206di,\nand use Lemma 3. Using similar estimates as above, we obtain an a priori energy estimate,\nin fact an absorbing set, in W 2 \u00d7 H 2 (T M ), and by bootstrapping, we may easily obtain\nhigher-order a priori estimates. Local well-posedness follows again from the contraction\nmapping argument that we gave in Theorem 1, so we have the following\nTheorem 5. For n = 2, 3, s > 1, \u2202M = \u2205, R = 0 and u0 \u2208 W s , d0 \u2208 H s+1 (T M ),\nu \u2208 C 0 ([0, \u221e], W s ),\n\nd \u2208 C 0 ([0, \u221e], H s+1 (T M )\n\nare solutions to the system of equations (1.1). Moreover, there exists a compact global\nattractor for the system (1.1) in W s\u22121 \u00d7 H s (T M ).\nIt is not difficult to generalize this Theorem to manifolds with boundary following the\nmethod in [18].\n\n\fLIQUID CRYSTALS ON RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS\n\n21\n\n7. Concluding remarks\nGradient flow versus damping. We considered the L2 gradient flow of the variation\nof the action function S(\u03b7, d) with respect to d in the director field equation (1.1c). In\nthe liquid crystal literature, however, it is common to see a damped second-order equation\nfor the director field (see [4] and references therein), which in the context of our simplified\nsystem would mean replacing dt with \u03b21 dtt + \u03b22 dt for some constants \u03b21 and \u03b22 . Of course,\nboth types of equations have the identical stationary solutions, but in terms of stability,\nL. Simon's result [22] guarantees that the damping term takes over. As far as parabolic\nestimates are concerned, it is easy to treat either type of equation, but we feel it is more\nnatural to take the path of steepest descent in relaxing the orientation towards its preferred\nconfiguration.\nLie advection versus parallel transport. This remark concerns the coupling term \u2207u d\nin equation (1.1c). This term arises by considering the time derivative of (d \u25e6 \u03b7)(t, x) :=\nd(t, \u03b7(t, x)), where for each t, \u03b7(t, *) is a volume-preserving diffeomorphism in the topological\ns . In group-theoretic language, this suggests that the action of D s\ngroup D\u03bc,D\n\u03bc,D on the vector\ns\nspace of director fields is on the right. The natural action of D\u03bc,D\non the vector space of\ndirector fields, however, is on the left, or by push-forward: instead of d \u25e6 \u03b7, the natural\naction is \u03b7\u2217 d := D\u03b7 * d \u25e6 \u03b7 \u22121 . Taking the time derivative of [\u03b7\u2217 d](t, x) gives Lu d, the Lie\nderivative of d in the direction u. The Lie derivative Lu d = \u2207u d \u2212 \u2207d u, and this is the\nactual term which is present in the Ericksen-Leslie model. A nontrivial extension of our\nanalysis is required to analyze the system (1.1) with \u2207u d replaced by Lu d, and this shall\nbe the focus of a future article.\nOther fluids models. Using our methodology, it is quite easy to study a number of other\nfluids models. For\nR example, by replacing the Oseen-Frank energy with the Landau-Lifshitz\nfree energy 1/2 M Ag(\u2207M, \u2207M )\u03bc, where M is the direction of magnetization in a cubic\nferromagnet, we can obtain an almost identical system of PDEs. Similarly, if we replace\nthe vector d in our action function S with a scalar field \u03c6, and replace the L2 gradient\nflow in equation (1.1c) with H \u22121 gradient flow, we obtain a model of two-phase flow whose\ninterface moves via motion by mean curvature (see [15]). This model consists of a coupled\nNavier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard system, where the interface is governed by surface tension.\nThe defect law in the limit as \u01eb \u2192 0. We considered the GL penalization of the OseenFrank energy law so as to obtain finite-energy minimizers, but we have yet to consider the\nlimit of our solutions as \u01eb \u2192 0. It remains an open problem to characterize the dynamical\nlaw of the GL vortices when coupled to the Navier-Stokes motion. Following the pioneering\nwork in [2] and [13] on the dynamical law of the GL vortices, we expect that the location\nof the jth vortex, aj , will solve the distributional equation\n\u2202t aj + div(aj u) =\n\n\u03b4W\n,\n\u03b4aj\n\nP\nwhere u simultaneously solves the Navier-Stokes equations, and W = i6=j log |xi \u2212 xj | is\nthe renormalized energy. We expect that a rigorous defect law will be much easier to obtain\nwhen u is instead a solution of the LANS equations, because in that case, u is uniformly in\nH 1 with respect to the penalization parameter \u01eb > 0.\n\n\f22\n\nSTEVE SHKOLLER\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to Chun Liu for introducing me to the beautiful theory of liquid crystals.
