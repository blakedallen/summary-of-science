Q. Chen and Hai-Tao Zhang\u2217\nThis paper uncovers a pitfall in the phase transition mechanism of Vicsek et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n75, 1226 (1995)] which occurs with fairly high probability and leads to complete breakdown of the\nmodel dynamics.\nPACS numbers: 87.19.St, 89.75.Hc, 02.50.Le, 87.10.+e\n\nIn [1], a phase transition model was given in a system\nof self-driven particles. Due to the dramatic advances in\nthe emerging and active research of natural and artificial\ncomplex networks, the Vicsek model has been drawing\nmore and more attention recently and gaining ascending\npopularity in the field [2]\u2013[6]. The velocities {vi } of the\nparticles were constructed to have an absolute value v\nand a direction given by the angle \u03b8(t + 1). This angle\nwas obtained from the expression \u03b8(t+1) = h\u03b8 (t)ir +\u2206\u03b8,\nwhere h\u03b8 (t)ir := arctan [hsin (\u03b8 (t))ir / hcos (\u03b8 (t))ir ] denotes the average direction of the velocities of particles\n(including particle i) within radius r surrounding the\ngiven particle (hsin (\u03b8 (t))ir and hcos (\u03b8 (t))ir being the\naverage sine and cosine values of the velocities respectively), and \u2206\u03b8 represents a random noise with a uniform\nprobability from the interval [\u2212\u03b7/2, \u03b7/2].\nHowever, in bacterial colony, flocks of birds, schools of\nfish and multi-particle systems, it is fairly possible that\nthe effects of all particles counteract completely within a\nradius of r. We define such a phenomenon as direction\nannihilation. Some simple examples are given in Fig. 1.\nIt can be easily shown that the possibility of such cases\noccurring descends with increasing number of particles.\nSince 0/0 is not properly defined, the phase transition mechanism in [1] breaks down when hsin (\u03b8 (t))ir =\nhcos (\u03b8 (t))ir = 0 (i.e. direction annihilation) within a radius of r around a particular particle. The probability of\ndirection annihilation occurring is statistically simulated\nover 1000 runs for each \u03b7 and L and shown in Fig. 2 with\nL being the linear size of a square cell. It can be observed\nthat the lower the density, the more likely that direction annihilation can occur, which agrees with the fact\nthat the possibility of direction annihilation occurring\ndescends with increasing number of particles. Moreover,\nthe probability of direction annihilation increases with\nthe intensity enhancement of the noise as the noise tends\nto break the synchronised direction of particles therefore\nincrease the possibility of direction annihilation. As di\u2217 Electronic\n\nrection annihilation occurs with a fairly high probability\nand it potentially jeopardises all the processes and research works employing the Vicsek Model ([2]\u2013[6]), it is\nnecessary to overcome this problem in [1].\nWe propose three possible transition rules governing\nthe self-driven particle system: keep the original direction, add one most adjacent particle outside the radius r\nor drop one farthest particle within the radius. The latter\ntwo are equivalent to slightly increasing and decreasing\nthe radius respectively. Any of the above three rules is\nsufficient to overcome the problem in Vicsek's Model.\n\nFIG. 1: Cases of direction annihilation.\n\nDirection Annihilation Probability (%)\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0703532v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 20 Mar 2007\n\nDepartment of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, U.K.\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n2\n25\n\n1.5\n\n\u03b7\n\n20\n\n1\n\n15\n\n0.5\n\n10\n0\n\nL\n\n5\n\nFIG. 2: Direction annihilation probability.\n\naddress: hz254@cam.ac.uk\n\n[1] T.
