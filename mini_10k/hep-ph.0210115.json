In the improved ladder approximation, the tree-level one-gluon-exchange diagram, with its QCD coupling strength being replaced by the running MS one, is assumed to give\na dominant contribution in the attractive force\nbetween quark and anti-quark (q q\u0304).\nThe method actually succeeded in explaining many quantitative relations among the low\nenergy hadronic data in QCD [3, 4, 5, 6, 9]\nand established its qualitative validity. Recently,\nit has also been adopted to predict properties\nof QCD under extreme conditions (hot and/or\ndense QCD) [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\nIt is known, however, that a naive use of\nthis approximation, combined with the high energy QCD coupling such as \u03b1MS\ns (MZ ), predicts\nthe pion decay constant f\u03c0 significantly smaller\nthan its experimentally observed value f\u03c0 =\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\u2020 E-mail:\n\nmichioh@post.kek.jp\ntanabash@tuhep.phys.tohoku.ac.jp\n\n92.4MeV. [3, 4] (See, for example, our Figure 4,\nwhere we obtained f\u03c0 of order 30MeV for the oneloop running of the MS coupling.) Note that the\ndecay constant f\u03c0 determines the scale of chiral\nphase transition in QCD. Does this discrepancy\nindicate the existence of substantial non-ladder\ncontribution in the driving force of the dynamical\nchiral symmetry breaking? If this is so, the success of the improved ladder approximation should\nbe regarded as an accidental coincidence, without\nunderstanding deeply the nature of the driving\nforce of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.\nFailing to explain the experimental value of f\u03c0\nfrom the high energy QCD coupling strength, the\nimproved ladder SD equation is often regarded as\na viable phenomenological model of low energy\nQCD, in which we can freely tune its coupling\nstrength so as to make f\u03c0 consistent with the\nexperimental value. We emphasize, however, in\norder to perform trustful analysis of QCD under\nextreme conditions, the low energy models need\nto be connected smoothly with the high energy\nQCD. The discrepancy of f\u03c0 thus causes a serious trouble in the analysis of the critical behavior\nof hot and/or dense QCD.\nIn this paper, we point out that the previous calculations so far made for f\u03c0 overlooked\nthe existence of scale ambiguity [15] in the improved ladder SD equation. In order to settle\nthe ambiguity, we introduce a concept of effec-\n\n\f2\ntive coupling [16, 17] in the analysis of the improved ladder SD equation of QCD. (The idea\nsimilar to our effective coupling was proposed in\nthe analysis of SD equation by Ref.[17] for different purpose to ours. It was also adopted by\nRef.[18, 19] for the analysis of SD equation in\ngauge theories with extra dimensions.) The effective coupling is calculated using the background\nfield method [20] in this paper. We next calculate numerically the improved ladder SD equation and obtain the value of the pion decay constant f\u03c0 using the high energy QCD coupling\n\u03b1MS\ns (MZ ) as an input parameter of the analysis.\nWithin Higashijima-Miransky approximation [1],\nwe obtain f\u03c0 = 85\u2013106MeV depending on the\nvalue of \u03b1MS\ns (MZ ) = 0.1172 \u00b1 0.0020 [21]. The\nagreement of the calculated f\u03c0 with the experimentally observed value f\u03c0 = 92.4MeV (or the\nvalue in the chiral limit mu = md = ms = 0,\nf\u03c0 = 86MeV [22]) is rather impressing. The discrepancy of f\u03c0 is resolved in our analysis. We\nthus ascertained the validity of the improved ladder SD equation more firmly than considered before.\nWe organize the present paper as follows: In\nSection II we give a brief derivation of the SD\nequation and point out the problem of the scale\nambiguity. In Section III the concept of effective\ncoupling is introduced. The behavior of QCD\ncoupling and its regularization are discussed in\nSection IV. In Section V we give our results\nof numerical analysis within the HigashijimaMiransky approximation to the angular integral\nof the SD equation. A numerical analysis without\nthe Higashijima-Miransky approximation is performed in Section VI using the non-local gauge\nfixing parameter method. Section VII is devoted\nfor summary and discussions.\n\nII.\n\nLADDER SCHWINGER-DYSON\nEQUATION\n\nWe outline here a derivation of the ladder SD\nequation based on Ref.[23, 24, 25]. We first integrate out the gluon field from the QCD Lagrangian at the tree level. We then obtain a bilocal interaction model,\n\nwith gluon propagator D\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (x) being given by\nD\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (x) \u2261\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 4\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\nd k \u2212ik*x gs2\ng\n\u2212\n(1\n\u2212\n\u03be)\n.(2)\ne\n\u03bc\u03bd\n(2\u03c0)4\nk2\nk2\nHere gs and \u03be are the QCD coupling constant\nand the gauge parameter, respectively. In Eq.(1)\nwe have neglected six or higher quark interaction terms. The ladder SD equation for the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking can be derived\nfrom Eq.(1) (bi-local four fermion interaction) in\na similar manner to the gap equation in the NJL\nmodel (local four fermion interaction). We obtain\nZ\nCF\nd4 q\n2\nA(\u2212p ) = 1 +\n\u00d7\n\u2212p2 (2\u03c0)4 i\n\u0014\np*q\nA(\u2212q 2 )\n2\n\u00d7\ng (1 + \u03be)\n\u2212A2 (\u2212q 2 )q 2 + B 2 (\u2212q 2 ) s\n(p \u2212 q)2\n\u0015\np * (p \u2212 q)q * (p \u2212 q)\n+2(1 \u2212 \u03be)\n,\n(3a)\n(p \u2212 q)4\nZ\nd4 q\n\u00d7\nB(\u2212p2 ) = CF\n(2\u03c0)4 i\n3+\u03be\nB(\u2212q 2 )\n, (3b)\n\u00d7\ng2\n\u2212A2 (\u2212q 2 )q 2 + B 2 (\u2212q 2 ) s \u2212(p \u2212 q)2\nwith CF \u2261 Ta Ta = (Nc2 \u2212 1)/(2Nc ) = 4/3 being the Casimir of the fundamental representation of SU (Nc = 3). The functions A(\u2212p2 ) and\nB(\u2212p2 ) in Eq.(3) are quark wave-function and\nmass-function, respectively. The quark propagator S is given in terms of these functions,\niS \u22121 (p) = /pA(\u2212p2 ) \u2212 B(\u2212p2 ).\n\nNonvanishing mass-function B 6= 0 implies the\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. It\nis therefore regarded as an order parameter of\nthis system.\nPerforming the Wick rotation and the angular\nintegrals, we obtain\nCF\nA(x) = 1 +\nx\n\nB(x) = CF\n1\nd4 x1 d4 x2 \u00d7\n2\n\u00d7(\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc T a \u03c8)x1 (\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bd T a \u03c8)x2 D\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (x1 \u2212 x2 ),(1)\n\nSBL =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x \u03c8\u0304i/\n\u2202\u03c8 +\n\nZ\n\n(4)\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u039b2\n\ndy\n\n0\n\n\u039b2\n\ndy\n\nyA(y)\nKA (x, y),\nyA2 (y) + B 2 (y)\n(5a)\nyB(y)\nKB (x, y). (5b)\n+ B 2 (y)\n\nyA2 (y)\n\nHere we have introduced the ultraviolet (UV)\ncutoff \u039b in the SD equation. It is known that\n\n\f3\nthe result of the SD equation is insensitive to the\ncutoff \u039b if we take sufficiently large \u039b in QCD.\nThe integral kernels KA and KB of the SD equation Eq.(5) are given by\n1\n2\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8 sin2 \u03b8 \u00d7\n0\n\u221a\nh\nxy cos \u03b8\n\u00d7\u03b1s (3 \u2212 \u03be)\nz i\nxy\n\u22122(1 \u2212 \u03be) 2 sin2 \u03b8 ,\n(6a)\nz\nZ \u03c0\n1\n(3 + \u03be)\u03b1s\nKB (x, y) \u2261\n,(6b)\nd\u03b8 sin2 \u03b8\n2\n2\u03c0 0\nz\nKA (x, y) \u2261\n\nwith z and \u03b1s being the square of the gluon momentum,\n\u221a\nz \u2261 x + y \u2212 2 xy cos \u03b8\n\n(7)\n\nand the QCD coupling\n\u03b1s \u2261\n\ngs2\n,\n4\u03c0\n\n(8)\n\nrespectively.\nThe ladder SD equation Eq.(5) combined with\nthe kernel Eq.(6) does not take account of the\nrunning of QCD coupling strength, however. In\norder to make the ladder SD equation consistent with the renormalization group (RG) consideration, the bi-local four-fermion interaction in\nEq.(1) needs to be modified to include its running\neffects. A widely adopted prescription for such a\npurpose is to replace the QCD coupling gs with\nthe MS renormalized one gs (\u03bc) \u221a\nwhere \u03bc is identified with the gluon momentum z. [1, 26, 27, 28]\nThe prescription is not unique,\nhowever. Ac\u221a\ntually, we can use gs2 (\u03bc = c z) (c 6= 1, c >\u221a0)\ninstead of the conventional choice gs2 (\u03bc = z)\n(scale ambiguity [15]). Even if we adopt c 6= 1,\nthe solution of the SD equation is shown to\nbe consistent with the RG. Moreover, as we\nstated previously, naive analysis based on the improved ladder SD equation with c = 1 predicts\nf\u03c0 much lower than its experimentally observed\nvalue f\u03c0 = 92.4MeV. [3, 4]\nIn order to calculate the pion decay constant\nf\u03c0 from the high energy QCD coupling \u03b1s (MZ ),\nwe thus need to resolve the scale ambiguity in\nthe context of the improved ladder SD equation.\nWe consider this problem in the next section by\nintroducing the concept of effective coupling.\n\nIII.\n\nEFFECTIVE COUPLING IN QCD\n\nBefore investigating the scale ambiguity of the\nimproved ladder SD equation of QCD, we first\nconsider simpler model, the strongly coupled\nQED with N flavor of massless fermions [29, 30].\nIn this model, ladder SD equation can be derived from a bi-local four-fermion interaction\nQED\n(x1 \u2212 x2 ),\n(\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8)x1 (\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8)x2 D\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(9)\n\nwhich is induced by the photon propagator\nQED\nD\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n(x) \u2261\nZ 4\nd k \u2212ik*x ge2\ne\n(g\u03bc\u03bd + (gauge fixing)) ,\n(2\u03c0)4\nk2\n(10)\n\nwith ge being the QED coupling constant.\nThanks to the Ward-Takahashi (WT) identities of QED, it is enough to calculate vacuum\npolarization function (loop correction to the photon propagator) for the evaluation of the bi-local\nfour-fermion interaction Eq.(9). At the one-loop\nlevel, the ge2 /k 2 part of Eq.(10) is then replaced\nas\nge2\nge2\n\u2192\n2\n2\nQED\nk\n(1 \u2212 ge \u03a0\n(k 2 )) k 2\n1\n! , (11)\n=\n1\nQED 2\n\u2212 \u03a0MS (k , \u03bc) k 2\n2\ngeMS\n(\u03bc)\nwith geMS being the MS renormalized QED coupling. The MS renormalization is performed in\nthe second line of Eq.(11).

The ladder type diagrams are resummed\nto all orders in the ladder SD equation. So, some\nportion of the ladder contribution will be doubly\ncounted if we simply adopt the PT effective coupling in the analysis of the improved ladder SD\nequation with \u03be 6= 1.\n\neliminates the finite part\n\u03a0QED\n(k 2 , \u03bc =\nMS\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\np\n5\n|k 2 | exp \u2212 ) = 0.\n6\n\n(16)\n\nThe other method is to use the effective coupling in the improved ladder SD equation. The\neffective coupling is defined by\n1\n1\nQED 2\n\u2212 \u03a0MS\n(k , \u03bc).\n2 (\u2212k 2 , \u03bc) \u2261 g 2\n(\u03bc)\ngeff\neMS\n\n(17)\n\nThe \u03bc-dependence in the RHS of Eq.(17) cancels at the leading-order. This method has an\nadvantage compared with the former one that\nit can easily deal with massive particles in loop.\nWe therefore adopt the effective coupling method\nhereafter.\nWe now turn to the problem of the scale ambiguity of the improved ladder SD equation of\nQCD. As we have done in the case of QED, we\nneed to calculate loop corrections to the bi-local\nfour-fermion interaction Eq.(1) in QCD. A difficulty arises, however, in the case of QCD, where\nSlavnov-Taylor (ST) identities hold instead of the\nQED-like WT identities. Due to the lack of the\nQED-like WT identities, evaluation of the vacuum polarization function is not enough to renormalize the QCD coupling constant.\nPinch technique (PT) method developed by\nCornwall and Papavassiliou [31, 32] may be a\nhopeful candidate to resolve the scale ambiguity in the improved ladder SD equation of QCD.\nThe effective coupling in the (S-matrix) PT is\nextracted from the on-shell q q\u0304 scattering amplitude. Since the renormalization scale dependence\nshould cancel in the on-shell amplitude, the scale\nambiguity in the q q\u0304 scattering amplitude is automatically resolved in the PT. In addition, it does\nnot depend on the choice of the gauge parameter.\nWe note, however, that these great features of the\nPT effective coupling is assured only when contributions of the pinch part of the ladder type\ndiagram Figure 1 is included in the amplitude.\nThe pinch part of Figure 1 gives non-zero amplitude in gauges other than the Feynman gauge\n\nFIG. 1: Ladder-like diagram which is included in the\ndefinition of the PT effective coupling.\n\nWe therefore adopt here a slightly different\nchoice, the background gauge fixing method [20],\nwhere the QED-like WT identities hold even in\nthe case of QCD. Thanks to the naive QED-like\nWT identities, the QCD coupling can be easily\nrenormalized by the calculation of the vacuum\npolarization function in this method\n1\n1\nQCD 2\n\u2212 \u03a0MS\n(k , \u03bc),\n2 (\u2212k 2 , \u03bc) \u2261 g 2\n(\u03bc)\ngeff\nsMS\n\n(18)\n\nwith \u03a0QCD\n(k 2 , \u03bc) being the MS regularized vacMS\nuum polarization function. The MS renormalized\nQCD coupling is denoted by gsMS . Using the oneloop finite part of \u03a0QCD\n(k 2 , \u03bc), it is easy to show\nMS\nthat the \u03bc-dependence cancels in the Eq.(18) at\nthe leading-order. We note that the coupling\nEq.(18) can be free from the double counting\nproblem in the ladder SD equation, since it does\nnot include contributions from the ladder type\ndiagrams.\nAfter a straightforward calculation, we obtain\n\u0014\nQCD 2\n\u03a0MS\n(k , \u03bc) = CG 4I0R (k 2 , \u03bc) \u2212 I1R (k 2 , \u03bc)\n\u0015\n(1 \u2212 \u03bebg ) 1 (1 \u2212 \u03bebg )2\n\u22122\n+\n(4\u03c0)2\n4 (4\u03c0)2\n\u22128TR\n\nNF\nX\n\nf =1\n\nI2R (k 2 , m2f , \u03bc).

Since we are interested in the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, we consider the running below the scale of\nb-quark mass mb = 4.3GeV.\nIn our analysis, we use the PDG average [21]\nof the high energy QCD coupling \u03b1MS\ns (\u03bc = MZ ),\n\u03b1MS\ns (MZ ) = 0.1172 \u00b1 0.0020,\n\nNF = 5, (24)\n\nwhere the MS coupling is defined in QCD with\nNF = 5 flavor of quarks. Eq.(24) corresponds to\n\nwith\nXf \u2261\n\ns\n\n\u2212k 2\n.\n4m2f \u2212 k 2\n\n(22)\n\nFor a massless quark mf = 0, the expression\nEq.(21) reads\n2\n\n1 \u2212k\n5\n(4\u03c0)2 I2R (k 2 , m2f = 0) = \u2212 ln 2 + . (23)\n6\n\u03bc\n18\nNote here that the Eq.(18) depends on the choice\nof the gauge fixing parameter \u03bebg . It is also\nknown that the effective coupling Eq.(18) with\n\u03bebg = 1 coincides with the PT effective coupling. [33, 34]\nSuch a \u03bebg -dependence cancels with the laddertype contributions and other vertex corrections\nin the one-loop amplitude. The ladder-type diagrams are resummed in the analysis of the ladder\nSD equation with a particular gauge parameter\n\u03be. It is therefore plausible to take \u03bebg = \u03be. As\nwe will show in section V, the most convenient\ngauge parameter is \u03be = 0 in the analysis of the\nladder SD equation with Higashijima-Miransky\napproximation. We will therefore take \u03bebg = 0\nin the analysis of following sections. We will also\nuse \u03bebg = 1 (the PT effective coupling) in order\nto make a comparison between them.\nWe comment on the choice of the renormalization scale \u03bc which minimizes the finite correction Eq.(19). It is easy to find, for NF = 0, the\n\n\u03b1MS\ns (mb ) = 0.2197 \u00b1 0.0075,\n\nNF = 4,\n\n(25)\n\nat the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO),\nand\n\u03b1MS\ns (mb ) = 0.2188 \u00b1 0.0074,\n\nNF = 4,\n\n(26)\n\nat the next-to-leading-order (NLO) approximation. We note that the difference between NLO\nand NNLO is of negligible order at \u03bc = mb .\nThe renormalization group equation (RGE)\nof MS coupling is solved numerically below the\nscale of mb using Eq.(25) as its boundary condition. As we noted before, the difference between Eq.(25) and Eq.(26) is insignificant. We\nassume mu = md = ms = 0 for three light\nquarks. The NF = 4 MS RGE is adopted for\n\u03bc \u2265 mc = 1.3GeV, while NF = 3 is used for\n\u03bc \u2264 mc . Figure 2 shows the running behavior\nof one- and two-loop MS couplings. Note here\nthat the two-loop effects become important for\n\u03bc<\n\u223c 1GeV.\nWe emphasize here that we do not use Eq.(24)\ndirectly as a boundary condition of the one-loop\nRGE. Actually, the two-loop RGE effect between\nMZ and mb is of non-negligible order. If we adopt\ndirectly Eq.(24) as the RGE boundary condition,\nthe one-loop RGE leads to the value of \u03b1MS\ns (mb )\nsizably smaller than the values of Eq.(25) and\nEq.(26).

[6]\nWe also emphasize that the mass function at\nthe zero momentum B(0) depends significantly\non the choice of the IR parameters \u03b10 and \u03b11 .\nWe find, however, that the \"constituent quark\nmass\" defined as [3]\nmconst = B(4m2const ),\n\n(39)\n\nis rather insensitive to \u03b10 and \u03b11 . (See Figure 4b.) Our result on mconst is also consistent\nwith the previous analysis.\nWe next consider the improved ladder SD\nequation combined with the effective coupling\nEq.(27) and Eq.(30). We adopt two-loop MS\ncoupling as \u03b1MS\ns (\u03bc) in Eq.(27) and Eq.(30). The\nleading-log dependence on \u03bc cancels in the definition of \u03b1eff\nas \u221a\nwe noted before. We take\ns\n2\n\u03b1eff\nz) in order to take account\ns (\u2212k = z, \u03bc =\nof the next-to-leading-log effects.\nWe show our results on f\u03c0 and mconst in Figure 5. Again, the results are quite insensitive to\nthe variation of IR regularization parameters \u03b10\nand \u03b11 . We also note that the calculated f\u03c0 from\n\u03b1eff\ns with \u03bebg = 0 agrees very well with its experimentally observed value f\u03c0 = 92.4MeV. The\nresult suggests the validity of our method to set-\n\ntle the scale ambiguity in the improved ladder\nSD equation. It may also imply importance of\nthe ladder diagrams in the mechanism of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking of QCD.\nIf we adopt \u03bebg = 1 in the effective coupling,\non the other hand, the calculated f\u03c0 becomes\nsizably larger than 92.4MeV (of order 120MeV).\nThis deviation of f\u03c0 in \u03bebg = 1 may be understood as an indication of the double counting of\nthe ladder diagrams as we described before. This\npoint should be investigated further in future.\nIn order to figure out the effects of the two-loop\nRGE in the effective coupling, we next perform\nanalyses using one-loop \u03b1MS\ns (\u03bc) in Eq.(27) and\nEq.(30). In this case, the \u03bc-dependence is completely canceled in the effective coupling. Our\nresults are shown in Figure 6. These results are\nsizably smaller than the results of Figure 5. The\neffect of two-loop RGE is therefore sizable in the\neffective coupling. Although the f\u03c0 at \u03bebg = 1\nagrees well with its experimental value 92.4MeV,\nthe agreement should be regarded as an accidental coincidence. Actually, the results shown in\nFigure 6 sizably decrease if we adopt Eq.(24) directly, instead of Eq.(25), as the boundary condition of the one-loop RGE.\nWe have so far used the central value of\nEq.(25), \u03b1MS\ns (mb ) = 0.2197 as an input parameter of the QCD coupling. Larger the \u03b1MS\ns (mb ),\nlarger f\u03c0 is obtained in our framework, however.\nThe uncertainty of the high energy QCD coupling thus leads to an uncertainty of our results\non f\u03c0 . There also exists uncertainty coming from\nthe choice of the IR regularization parameters \u03b10\n\n\fPSfrag replacements\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n=5\n=6\n=7\n=8\n\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n700\n\n(a)\n\n\u03bebg = 1\n\u03bebg = 0\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b10 /\u03c0 = 2\u03b10 /\u03c0\n=3\n= 4\u03b10 /\u03c0\n/\u03c0\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 \u03b100.9\n\u03b1\n0 /\u03c0\n\u03b11/\u03b10\n\n=5\n=6\n=7\n=8\n\nmconst [MeV]\n\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n\nf\u03c0 [MeV]\n\n9\n\n600\n\n\u03b10 /\u03c0 = 2\n=3\n=4\n\u03bebg = 1\n\n(b)\n\n500\n400\n300\n\n\u03bebg = 0\n\n200\n100\n0\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n\u03b11/\u03b10\n\n=5\n=6\n=7\n=8\n\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n(a)\n\n700\n\n\u03b10 /\u03c0 = 2\n=3\n=4\n\u03bebg = 1\n\u03bebg = 0\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n\u03b11/\u03b10\n\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n/\u03c0\n0.8 \u03b100.9\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n\n=5\n=6\n=7\n=8\n\nmconst [MeV]\n\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n\u03b10 /\u03c0\n\nf\u03c0 [MeV]\n\nFIG. 5: Results of (a) the pion decay constant f\u03c0 and (b) the \"constituent quark mass\" mconst with use\nof the effective couplings (two-loop RGE + finite part).

Since we use\nthe non-local gauge parameter \u03be(z) Eq.(40) in\nour analysis of the SD equation, there does not\nexist a priori choice of the gauge parameter \u03bebg\nin the effective coupling. We thus adopt both\n\u03bebg = 0 (Figure 9) and \u03bebg = 1 (Figure 10) and\ncompare the results. Again, the \u03b10 -dependence\nof the results is of non-negligible order. The calculated f\u03c0 is relatively close to the observed value\nf\u03c0 = 92.4MeV for \u03b10 = 2\u20134\u03c0 with \u03bebg = 0, while\n\u03bebg = 1 leads to a little bit larger predictions\nfor the same range of \u03b10 . Considering that the\nnon-local gauge \u03be(z) Eq.(40) approaches \u03be = 0 in\nthe asymptotic region, \u03bebg = 0 might be slightly\nbetter choice than \u03bebg = 1.\n\nVII.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have calculated the pion decay constant f\u03c0 from the high energy QCD coupling strength \u03b1MS\ns (MZ ) by using the improved\nladder Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation. The SD\nequation was analyzed both with and without\nthe Higashijima-Miransky approximation for its\nangular integral. The non-local gauge parameter method was adopted in the analysis without the Higashijima-Miransky approximation in\norder to keep the wave-function factor trivial\nA \u2261 1. The effective coupling was calculated\nin the background gauge fixing method with arbitrary covariant gauge parameter \u03bebg . Analyzing the Landau gauge improved ladder SD equation combined with the \u03bebg = 0 next-to-leadingorder effective coupling, we obtained f\u03c0 = 85\u2013\n106MeV depending on the value of \u03b1MS\ns (MZ ) =\n0.1172 \u00b1 0.0020 within the Higashijima-Miransky\napproximation. Our result impressively agrees\nwith its experimental value f\u03c0 = 92.4MeV and\nsuggests quantitative validity of the improved\nladder SD equation. It is interesting to compare\nour result on f\u03c0 with the previous analyses [3, 4]\nwhere the value of the calculated f\u03c0 is less than a\nhalf of its experimental value f\u03c0 = 92.4MeV. In\nthe previous analyses, the renormalization scale\n\u03bc waspnaively identified with the gluon momentum |k 2 | in the ladder SD equation. Such an\nidentification has the problem of the scale ambiguity, however, as we pointed out in this paper. The improvement achieved in our analysis\ncomes mainly from our use of the effective cou-\n\npling, instead of the naive use of the one-loop\nMS coupling. The leading-order ln \u03bc dependence\nof \u03b1MS\ns (\u03bc) cancels with the \u03bc-dependence of the\nfinite correction in our effective coupling.\nWe found that the effective coupling with\n\u03bebg = 1 (the effective coupling derived in the\npinch technique (PT)) leads to a larger value of\nf\u03c0 . This deviation of f\u03c0 in \u03bebg = 1 may be understood as an indication of the double counting\nof the ladder diagrams in the analysis of the ladder SD equation in \u03be = 0 combined with the PT\neffective coupling (\u03bebg = 1). In the analysis of\nthe non-local gauge parameter method, we were\nnot able to obtain stable results. The results,\nhowever, were shown to be consistent with the\nresults of the Higashijima-Miransky approximation in order of magnitude.\nWe next comment on a different approach to\nthe scale ambiguity, in which \u03b1MS\ns (\u03bc) is used with\n\u03bc tuned so as to minimize the finite correction.\nIn the case of QED (or QCD in p\nNF \u2192 \u221e limit),\nsuch a scale is given by \u03bc =\n|k 2 | exp(\u22125/6)\nwith k being the momentum\nof\nphoton\n(gluon)\np\n2\npropagator, while it is \u03bc = |k | exp(\u2212205/264)\nin the case of the gluon propagator (\u03bebg = 0) of\nNF = 0 QCD. Since these scales are close to\neach other, it p\nmay be possible to use universally\nthe scale \u03bc = |k 2 | exp(\u22125/6) in the analysis of\nthe improved ladder SD equation. It is straightforward to evaluate the f\u03c0 in such a simple prescription. Thanks to the scale invariant property\nof the SD equation, we just need to multiply the\nfactor exp(5/6) to the result of f\u03c0 in the naive\nladder SD equation with the MS coupling. Figure 7 thus reads f\u03c0 = 64\u201382MeV for the one-loop\nMS and f\u03c0 = 122\u2013155MeV for the two-loop MS\nwith this prescription. The difference between\nthis method and the effective coupling method\ncomes from the rest of the finite corrections and\nthe treatment of the two-loop RGE.\nMany issues remain unsolved and need further\ninvestigation. In order to calculate the value of\nf\u03c0 more precisely with the non-local gauge parameter method, we need to evaluate the ladderexact f\u03c0 by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nof the pion. The problem of the \u03bebg dependence\nof the effective coupling should also be studied.\nIt is rather non-trivial task to find adequate relation between \u03be (the gauge parameter in the\nSD equation) and \u03bebg (the gauge parameter in\nthe effective coupling), especially in the non-local\ngauge parameter method. It is also interesting\nto investigate the critical behavior of the dense\n\n\f13\nper therefore provides deeper understanding of\nthe low energy QCD dynamics.\n\nand/or hot QCD using the effective coupling described in this paper. Since the method of the\nladder SD equation is now smoothly connected\nwith the high energy QCD, the high-density and\nhigh-temperature behaviors of the chiral phase\ntransition can now be studied in a more trustful\nmanner than before.\nFinally, the success of the ladder QCD implies\nthat a bulk of driving force of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking comes from the laddertype diagrams. The result presented in this pa-\n\nWe thank K.Yamawaki for his useful and helpful comments on an early draft of this paper. We\nwould also like to thank K.Hikasa and Y.Sumino\nfor stimulating discussions.\n\n[1] V. A. Miransky, Sov. J. Nucl. Phys. 38, 280\n(1983) [Yad. Fiz. 38, 468 (1983)]; K. Higashijima, Phys. Rev.
