Generically this limit is reached at low electron densities, when the Coulomb interaction suppresses\nspin-exchange between electrons. It appears at temperatures higher than the spin-exchange energy J, when the\nspin configuration of the wire becomes effectively static.\nMany of its properties [1, 2, 3] differ qualitatively from\nthose of the asymptotic low-energy limit described by\nthe Luttinger liquid [4]. It has been shown by Fogler\nthat spin-incoherent physics can also be observed at high\nelectron densities, when the Coulomb interaction induces\nthe Coulomb Tonks gas of impenetrable, but otherwise\nfree, electrons in ultra-thin quantum wires [5].\nIn this Letter we show that, rather than being just\none of many realizations of the spin-incoherent electron\ngas, the Coulomb Tonks gas exhibits its own and qualitatively different low-energy physics. Like most manybody effects observed in quantum wires without spinincoherence [6, 7, 8, 9] this shows in experiments where\nelectrons tunnel from an external probe, such as a scanning tunneling microscope tip, into the wire. We consider\nthe situation depicted in Fig. 1, panel a, where electrons\ntunnel into the wire near a static impurity. For a generic\nrepulsively interacting electron gas, such an impurity cuts\nthe wire into two at low energies [10]. Electrons then effectively tunnel into the end of a half-infinite conductor\nwithout any signatures of spin-incoherence [1]. In the\nCoulomb Tonks gas, in contrast, interactions are weak\nexcept for a \"hard core\" that renders the electrons impenetrable. Electron transmission through the impurity\nhere remains possible at low energies, ideally with an\nenergy-independent amplitude t. As a consequence, a\nmany-body resonance develops that can be anticipated\nalready from a perturbative analysis at weak transmission t \u226a 1. One finds that a perturbative calculation is\ninvalidated at low voltages V by contributions that diverge as ln(eV /\u039b), where \u039b is the bandwidth of the wire\n(we take the zero temperature limit at even smaller |J|).\nThe physics of these divergencies is analogous to that of\nsimilar divergencies in the Kondo model [11], and it is\nillustrated in panels b and c of Fig. 1: Two processes\n\na)\nv\nt\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\n=\nFIG. 1: Tunneling (amplitude v) into a conductor of impenetrable electrons near a scatterer (amplitude t). Panels b and\nc depict processes where charge (the red balls) scatters within\nthe wire after (b) or before (c) a tunneling event occurs. The\ntwo processes differ in the final spin orderings.\n\ncontribute to the correction of the tunneling current at\nlowest order in t. In the first, electron-like one an electron\ntunnels into the wire and subsequently transmits through\nthe impurity (Fig. 1 b). In the second, hole-like process\nan electron first scatters across the impurity and leaves a\nhole that then is filled by an electron tunneling in (Fig. 1\nc). The static spins of the Coulomb Tonks gas follow the\nmotion of charge, and thus, electrons scattering within\nthe wire shift the spatial spin ordering. In general, the\nabove two processes, where this shift of the spin state\noccurs either before or after the addition of a spin by the\ntunneling electron, therefore result in different final spin\nstates as illustrated in Fig 1. This prevents cancellations\nbetween the corrections to the tunneling amplitude due\nto these two processes that occur in the absence of spin.\nAfter a summation over intermediate electron and hole\nenergies, the mentioned divergencies result.\nBelow we resum these divergencies in the perturbation\nseries and find that they result in a power law divergency\nof the conductance Gtun for tunneling into the wire,\n\u0013\u03b1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\narcsin |t|\n2 arcsin |t|\n\u039b\n1\u2212\n,\n; \u03b1=\nGtun \u221d\neV\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n(1)\nwhere arcsin is the inverse of the sin-function. The resonance described here has the peculiar effect of induc-\n\n\f2\ning tunneling power laws with exponents that depend\non the scattering properties of and thus on the conductance through the wire. While tunneling exponents that\ndepend on the strength of electron-electron interactions\n[10] or the magnetic field [12] had been found before for\none-dimensional quantum wires, this effect is, to the best\nof our knowledge, characteristic of the Coulomb Tonks\ngas. Eq. (1) reproduces the exponent \u03b1 = 1/2 of the\nimpurity-free case at t = 1 [2, 3].\nIdeal Tonks Gas: A wire in the ideal (fermionic) Tonks\ngas limit is described by a one-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel with an infinite onsite repulsion U . This model is\nsolved exactly in terms of a static spin background and\nspinless fermions c, describing holes in the charge configuration [13, 14]. The electron annihilation operator \u03c8\u03c3\nin this solution is decomposed into the fermions c(x) and\noperators S\u03c3 (x) that add a spin \u03c3 to the spin background\nat position x as \u03c8\u03c3 (x) = c\u2020 (x)S\u03c3 (x). We study such a\nwire with an impurity at x = 0 at zero temperature and\neV \u226a \u039b, such that the spectrum may be linearlized,\nZ\n\u0011\ndq \u0010 \u2020\nq cLq cLq + c\u2020Rq cRq + HS ,\nH = vF\n2\u03c0\nHS =\n\n\u03bbS c\u2020L cR\n\n+ h.c.\n\n(2)\n\nHere, cLq , cRq create electrons with momentum\nq to\nR\nthe left and right of the impurity, c\u03bc = (dq/2\u03c0)c\u03bcq\n(\u03bc \u2208 {L, R}), \u03bbS is the amplitude for scattering across\nthe impurity, and vF the Fermi velocity.\nWe study the current Itun from a noninteracting tunnel\nprobe into the interacting wire at x = 0+ (we set h\u0304 = 1),\nh\nXZ\n>\n(\u2212\u03c4 ) (3)\nItun = 2|v|2\nd\u03c4 e\u2212ieV \u03c4 G\u03c3< (\u03c4 )Gprobe,\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\ni\n<\n(\u2212\u03c4 ) ,\n\u2212 G\u03c3> (\u03c4 )Gprobe,\u03c3\nwhere v is the amplitude for tunneling between wire and\nprobe, and G\u03c3 , Gprobe,\u03c3 are the Green functions of the\ninteracting wire and the tunnel probe, respectively. We\ntake v \u2192 0 to be arbitrarily small. The Green function\nG\u03c3> (\u03c4 ) = \u2212ih\u03c8\u03c3 (0+ , \u03c4 )\u03c8\u03c3\u2020 (0+ , 0)i at the point of tunneling in terms of hole and spin operators takes the form\nG\u03c3> (\u03c4 ) = \u2212ihS\u03c3 (0+ , \u03c4 )c\u2020R (\u03c4 )cR (0)S\u03c3\u2020 (0+ , 0)i.\n\n(4)\n\nThe spin expectation value in Eq. (4) is non-vanishing\nonly if all spins between the one at x = 0+ at time \u03c4 and\nthe spin that is at x = 0+ at time 0 have orientation \u03c3.\n|N (\u03c4 )\u2212NR (0)|\nThis\noccurs with probability p\u03c3 R\n, where NR =\nR\n\u2020\n(dq/2\u03c0)cRq cRq is the number of electrons to the right of\nthe impurity and p\u2191 = 1 \u2212 p\u2193 = [exp(\u2212\u03b2EZ ) + 1]\u22121 is the\nprobability for a spin at inverse temperature \u03b2 to point\nalong the magnetic field with Zeeman energy EZ \u226a eV .\nConsequently the spin and the charge expectation values\nin Eq.

We thus\nstart with a perturbative renormalization group (RG) approach valid at weak \u03bbS \u226a vF , summing all contributions\nto the perturbation series of leading order in the diverging logarithms at a given order in \u03bbS . To compute G\u03be\u03c3 ,\nEq. (6), and thus Itun via Eq. (3), we add the vertices\nX\nv\u03bck c\u03bc ei\u03be(NR \u2212k)\n(7)\nHv =\nk,\u03bc\u2208{L,R}\n\nto H. While not directly needed for G\u03be\u03c3 , the vertices\nwith \u03bc = L or k 6= 0 are included as they are generated\nby the RG flow. In terms of the logarithm l = ln(\u03c9/\u039b) of\nthe running cut-off \u03c9 we then find the scaling equations\ndvRk /dl = (2\u03c0vF )\u22121 \u03bbS (vLk \u2212 vLk+1 ),\n\ndvLk /dl = (2\u03c0vF )\u22121 \u03bb\u2217S (vRk \u2212 vRk\u22121 ).\n\n(8)\n\nHere, the first terms on the right hand sides of Eqs. (8)\nderive from electron-like processes (HS acting to the left\nof Hv - see Fig. 1 b), and the second terms are due to holelike events (Fig. 1 c). At low energies the eigenvector \u1e7d of\nthe right hand sides of Eqs. (8) with the smallest eigenvalue dominates their solution for generic initial conditions. We find \u1e7dLk = \u1e7d0 (\u22121)k , \u1e7dRk = \u1e7d0 (\u22121)k+1 \u03bbS /|\u03bbS |\nand the corresponding eigenvalue yields\nd\u1e7d0 /dl = \u2212(\u03c0vF )\u22121 |\u03bbS |\u1e7d0 .\n\n(9)\n\nThe Green function G\u03be\u03c3 , Eq. (6), averages a product of\ntwo of the vertices contained in Hv . Using the solution of\nEq. (9) in Eqs. (6) and (3) we arrive, up to prefactors, at\nthe scaling of the tunneling conductance Gtun = Itun /V ,\nGtun \u223c\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039b\neV\n\n\u00132|t|/\u03c0\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nHere, |t| = |\u03bbS |/vF + O(|\u03bbS |/vF )2 is the transmission\namplitude through the impurity introduced before. For\nsmall t the logarithmic divergencies encountered in a perturbation series in t thus indeed lead to the t-dependent\ntunneling exponent advertised in the introduction.\nGood Transmission: Eq. (10) is valid only at small\nt \u226a 1 and thus its scaling exponent is small and hard to\nmeasure. To access also the nonperturbative regime of\ngood transmission t \u2243 1 we employ a method that was\nintroduced by Abanin and Levitov in Ref. [15].

The dynamics of the\ncharge carrying holes in the interacting wire may then be\ndescribed by a Luttinger liquid with interaction parameter g. The ideal Tonks gas considered above is recovered\nat g = 1. At sufficiently high energies the forward scattering interactions are weak also on the Coulomb Tonks\ngas, |1 \u2212 g| \u226a 1. Hence we may include these interactions in our earlier perturbative RG approach valid at\nt \u226a 1. We first take g to be energy-independent. The\nflow equations (8) in that case have to be complemented\nby an additive contribution (g \u22121 \u2212 1)v\u03bck /2 to dv\u03bck /dl\n\n\f4\nand an additional equation dt/dl = (g \u22121 \u2212 1)t, yielding\n\u00131\u2212g\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n2|t| 1 \u2212 (eV /\u039b)1\u2212g\neV\n(21)\nexp\nGtun \u223c\n\u039b\n\u03c0\n1\u2212g\nat |1 \u2212 g| \u226a 1 (up to a prefactor). Expanding the power\nlaw inside the exponential of Eq. (21), we find that the\n\u22121\nscaling of Eq. (10) is still observable over <\n\u223c |1 \u2212 g|\ndecades, with a renormalized transmission tV and an additional renormalization of the tunneling amplitude v,\n\u00131\u2212g\n\u0012 \u00131\u2212g\u22122|tV |/\u03c0\n\u0012\nGtun (V )\nV\neV\nt, (22)\n\u223c\n, tV =\nGtun (V0 )\nV0\n\u039b\nfor | ln(V /V0 )| \u226a |1 \u2212 g|\u22121 . We expect that similarly also\nEq. (1) at strong transmission is robust against the weak\nforward scattering interactions in the Coulomb Tonks gas\nwith a restricted scaling range of voltages. At V = 0,\nGtun /Gtun |t=0 has an essential singularity at g = 1 [see\nEq. (21)]. This formally supports our earlier statement\nthat the ideal Tonks gas limit qualitatively differs from\nthe general spin-incoherent electron gas with g 6= 1. The\nabove nonanalyticity at V = 0 is an indication of possible nonanalyticities in ground state properties and thus\nof a quantum phase transition in our model at g = 1.\nThis conjecture finds further support in the scaling behavior of Gtun . Perfect scaling has been found only at the\n(possibly critical) point g = 1. But for sufficiently high\nenergies, eV \u226b eVg = \u039b exp(\u22121/|1 \u2212 g|), scaling persists\nto g 6= 1, the typical behavior around a quantum critical\npoint [16]. One may thus speculate that there is a phase\ntransition in our model between two qualitatively different ground states, where i) all spins in the interacting\nwire are entangled with the noninteracting probe (g > 1)\nand ii) this holds only for one half of the wire that is cut\ninto two by the impurity (g < 1). Definite statements\nabout the ground state, however, are not possible on the\nbasis of the above calculation, because it is perturbative\nin the amplitude v that grows large in the limit V \u2192 0.\nThe Coulomb Tonks gas is realized in wires whose radius R is much smaller than their effective Bohr radius\naB = h\u03042 \u03ba/m\u2217 e2 , such that the parameter L = ln(aB /R)\ngrows large [5]. Here, m\u2217 is the effective mass of the conduction electrons, and \u03ba is the dielectric constant of the\nsubstrate that supports the wire. The regime appears\nat high electron density n, when rs = 1/2naB is small,\nL\u22121 \u226a rs \u226a 1. The electrons in such a wire are impenetrable, with J \u2248 \u039b[rs (L + ln rs )]\u22121 , but otherwise\nfree at energies \u03c9 \u226b \u03c9 \u2217 exceeding an exponentially small\nscale \u03c9\u2217 = (\u039b/rs ) exp(\u2212\u03c0 2 /2rs ). The forward scattering\npart of the Coulomb potential is indeed a small perturbation described by an interaction parameter 1 \u2212 gC (\u03c9) \u2248\n(2rs /\u03c0 2 ) ln(\u039b/\u03c9) \u226a 1 [5]. Repeating our above RGanalysis for this energy-dependent\ninteraction,\np\n\u0001 we find\n\u221a\nv\u03bck \u223c exp[\u2212rs l2 /2\u03c0 2 \u2212 |t| \u03c0/4rs erf l rs /\u03c0 ]. For fre\u221a\nquency ratios ln(\u03c9/\u03c90 ) \u226a min{[1 \u2212 gC (\u03c9)]\u22121 , \u03c0/ rs } we\nmay expand the error function erf around l = ln(\u03c90 /\u039b) to\n\nfind for Gtun an expression like Eq. (22) with g = gC (eV )\nand tV = (eV /\u039b)(1\u2212g)/2 t. At t \u226a 1 the predicted scaling\n\u221a\n2\nis thus observable over <\n\u223c min{\u03c0 /2rs ln(\u039b/eV ), \u03c0/ rs }\ndecades with eV \u226b \u03b2 \u22121 . For the above effects to be observable the spin-incoherent condition \u03b2 \u22121 \u226b J has to be\nsatisfied. If tunneling takes place remote from the scatterer, at x = x0 6= 0, eV \u226a vF /x0 is required additionally. Our calculation further assumes eV \u226a \u039b0 , where \u039b0\nis the width of the energy window around the Fermi level\nin which the energy-dependence of the scattering amplitude \u03bbS may be neglected. The above scaling thus occurs at \u039b/rs (L + ln rs ) \u226a \u03b2 \u22121 \u226a eV \u226a min{vF /x0 , \u039b0 }.\nAlternatively, the Coulomb Tonks gas is found in gated\n\u22121\n2\nwires at R <\n\u223c aB and low densities, n \u226a aB /D \u226a aB ,\nwhere D is the distance between wire and gate [5, 17].\nThe physics described above is relevant also for ultracold clouds of fermionic atoms. There the Tonks gas\nregime g \u2248 1 is naturally realized since atoms are charge\nneutral and interact only via a local, \"hardcore\" potential. The bosonic Tonks gas [18, 19] as well as onedimensional Fermi gases [20] have already been demonstrated experimentally. Progress is being made in cooling Fermi gases substantially below the Fermi temperature [21, 22], as required to observe the scaling predicted\nabove. Also the experimental techniques for transport\nmeasurements with local probes as described above have\nbeen proposed [23, 24] and are expected to be experimentally implemented in the near future.\nConclusions: We have predicted a many-body scattering resonance for the strongly correlated Tonks gas\nregime of quantum wires. It is reminiscent of the Kondo\nresonance and possibly marks the critical point of a quantum phase transition. The effect occurs in the presence of\nstatic impurities and it has a clear and intriguing experimental signature: The tunneling current into the wire\nobeys a power law with an exponent that depends on the\nconductance through the wire. This anomalous scaling is\nobservable in ultra-thin wires at high electron density, in\ngated conductors at low density, and in ultracold gases\nof fermionic atoms.\nThe author thanks M. M.
