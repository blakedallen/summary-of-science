In Fig. 1 we show the number counts determined with different\nselection criteria. We find that the Log N \u2013Log S is yet undetermined within\na factor of \u223c 3, the reason for this is still under investigation.\nThe X-ray Log N \u2013Log S of galaxies at fainter fluxes can be constrained\nmaking use of the linear correlations between X-ray (0.5\u201310 keV), Far Infrared (FIR) and radio (1.4 GHz) luminosities discussed by Ranalli, Comastri & Setti (2003, A&A 399, 39). The radio counts for the sub-mJy\npopulation of faint, z \u223c 1 galaxies were converted into an X-ray Log N \u2013\nLog S; it is shown in Fig. 1 together with the total observed X-ray counts.\nThe FIR and radio luminosity functions (LFs) for normal galaxies\nmay also be converted to X-ray LFs. The LFs from different surveys\n(IRAS/PSCz, Takeuchi et al. 2003, ApJ 587, L89; ISO/ELAIS, Serjeant\net al. 2004, MNRAS submitted; radio 1.4GHz, Machalski & Godlowski\n2000, A&A 360, 463) were converted to the X-rays and integrated. We\nshow the integrated counts in Fig. 2.\nThe most important results are:\n\u2022 the X-ray Log N \u2013Log S may be expressed as N (> S) \u221d S \u223c(\u22121.3)\nin the flux interval 3 * 10\u221218 \u20133 * 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ;\n\u2022 the fraction of bona fide star forming galaxies among X-ray sources\nin current deep surveys (at a flux limit of 5 * 10\u221217 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 )\nis about 20%;\n\u2022 star forming galaxies are expected to become the dominant population among X-ray sources at fluxes fainter than 1\u20132*10\u221217 erg\ns\u22121 cm\u22122 .\n\n1\n\n\fNovember 7, 2018\n\n14:56\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nmessico\n\n2\n\nFigure 1.

Thick curve and horn-shaped\nsymbol: total X-ray number counts and results from fluctuation analysis, respectively.\nVertical dotted lines: limiting sensitivities for the radio surveys. The histograms show the\nobserved Log N \u2013Log S from normal galaxies. Short-dashed (lower) histogram: sources\nwith Log (X-ray/optical flux ratio) < \u22121. Dotted (middle) histogram: X-ray sources\nwith a radio detection and an Hii region-like optical spectrum (Bauer et al. 2002). Longdashed (upper) histogram: sources from the Bayesian sample of Norman et al.

Solid curves: X-ray counts derived from integration of the ELAIS 90\u03bc and\nIRAS 60\u03bc luminosity functions (lower triplet: Serjeant et al. 2004; upper triplet: Saunders et al. 1990, MNRAS 242, 318), converted to the X-rays. The main difference between\nthe two LFs is the evolution ((1 + z)3 for Serjeant's and (1 + z)6.7 for Saunders'). The\nlower and upper curves of each triplet show the integration to zmax = 1.1 and 2 respectively, with evolution (1 + z)3 . Middle curve: zmax = 2 but evolution stopped at\nz = 1. Other symbols as in Fig. 1. Similar results might be obtained from integration of\nthe radio (1.4GHz) luminosity function of star forming galaxies (Machalski & Godlowski\n2000). The stronger evolution found by Saunders et al. is not consistent with both the\nobserved counts and the limits from fluctuation analysis.\n\n\f"}
