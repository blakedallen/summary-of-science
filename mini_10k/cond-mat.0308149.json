INTRODUCTION\n\nA fundamental question on the high-Tc cuprates remains after more than fifteen years of the discovery of\nthe material. It is still not clear whether the cuprates\nare systems of Fermi liquid (FL), non-FL with exotic orders such as the stripes [1], or systems with more intricate co-existence of different states of matter [2]. In\nfact, this question arises in both their superconducting\nand normal states. Besides, it is not unusual that different experimental probes give different implications \u2013 the\nexperimental findings are not yet converged.\nA substantial progress in the STM measurement has\nmade it another route to this problem. Not only\nSTM looks directly into the real space, but also it can\nbe readily connected to the reciprocal space, so-called\nthe Fourier transformed STM (FT-STM). Data of the\nlow (and fixed) temperature STM on Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8\n(BSCCO) was claimed to be an excellent manifestation\nof the FL behavior [3,4]. But, since the cuprates are such\ninvolved systems, one should be more careful to nail down\nthe conclusion. Whether the observed STM modulation\n[5] is solely the Friedel stripe arising from the quasiparticle (QP) interference, or the Zaanen-Kivelson stripe [1]\ncoexisting with the Friedel stripe, is actually an issue\nstill in debate (see the contradictory data of Refs. [6] and\n[7]) [8]. Even if the stripes can be attributed to the QP\ninterference alone, it is still crucial to ask how well do\nthe quasiparticles behave? How is the extension of the\n\"Fermi-arc\", and up to what temperatures they survive\n[9]? So far there has been few finite-temperature and\nnormal-state STM studies on the cuprates [10]. These\nare the major concerns of the present paper.\nBased on the FL scenario, an abstract model named\n\nthe \"octet\" scattering model [5] has successfully ascribed the experimentally observed FT-STM peaks of the\nLDOS modulation to the quantum interference of the\nQPs. Later concrete single-impurity scattering calculations [11,3,4] also supported that. The occurrence of FTSTM peaks and their evolution with the bias change give\ninformation of the Fermi surface (FS) of the measured\nsystem which are consistent with previous results from\nthe angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. This provides a strong identification of a Friedel stripe out of\nthe Zaanen-Kivelson stripe. But nevertheless, some weak\nnon-dispersive peaks, which could be due to a coexisting\nZaanen-Kivelson stripe, may also exist [6\u20138].\nIt is important to investigate how far the FL picture\ncan be pushed, especially when the temperature is raised\nand the system enters the normal state. We thus have\nperformed similar FL-based calculations at different temperatures to study the Friedel stripes, for the reference\nof future experiments in checking the validity of the FL\npicture. It is found that stripe-like structure exists even\nin the normal state. This may be counterintuitive to\nthe octet model, since the octets should vanish in the\nnormal state. We argue that apart from the octets, a\nlocal-nesting property of the FS (especially important in\nthe normal state) can also give rise to sizable joint-DOS,\nand hence sizable QP scattering.\nIn Sec. II, we formulate the problem as the scattering\nfrom a single impurity. In Sec. III, we present the calculated spectra at different temperatures and the essential\nfeatures are remarked. In Sec. IV, the physical origin\nof the normal-state spectra are illucidated. It is noted\nthat in the normal state, the information of the entire\nFS can be revealed from the data of a single measuring\nbias. This is in contrast to the point-wise tracing out in\nthe dSC state. Sec. V is a closing section. In Appendix,\n\n\fwe make a comment to the present FT-STM data, pointing out that some additional peaks should exist in the\nmeasurement.\nII. FORMALISM\n\nSince the single-impurity scattering model was proved\nto be an excellent start for understanding the STM features in the dSC state, we proceed to study the finitetemperature phenomena based on it. We will be interested in those regions away from the impurity neighborhood. We consider the following Hamiltonian\nH = H0 + HI ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H0 is the usual BCS mean-field Hamiltonian\ni\nX\nXh\nH0 =\n\u03bek c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 +\n\u2206k c\u2020k\u2191 c\u2020\u2212k\u2193 + H.c.\n(2)\nk,\u03c3\n\nk\n\nwith \u03bek and \u2206k the band dispersion relative to chemical\npotential and the superconducting gap function respectively, and HI is the part associated with an impurity at\nsite 0,\ni\nXh\nX\n\u03b4tij c\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 +\n\u03b4\u2206ij c\u2020i\u2191 c\u2020j\u2193 + H.c.\nHI =\nhi,ji\n\nhi,ji,\u03c3\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n+ V0 c\u20200\u2191 c0\u2191 + c\u20200\u2193 c0\u2193 .\n\n(3)\n\nParameter \u03b4t is the deviation of local hopping, \u03b4\u2206 is the\ndeviation of local pairing potential, and V0 is the onsite impurity potential. This is a simplified model but\nnevertheless should be enough to bring out the essential\nfeatures of interest.\nIt is convenient to apply the Nambu representation for\nthe reciprocal and real-space operators:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\ncj\u2191\nck\u2191\n(4)\nand\n\u0108j \u2261 \u2020 ,\n\u0108k \u2261 \u2020\ncj\u2193\nc\u2212k\u2193\nwhich are related to each other via the Fourier transformation\n1 X \u2212ik*rj\n\u0108k = \u221a\n\u0108j .\n(5)\ne\nN j\nHere the sum is over all the lattice sites rj .

Define a single-particle Green's function matrix\n\u011c(ri , rj , \u03c4 ) = \u2212hT\u03c4 \u0108i (\u03c4 )\u0108j\u2020 (0)i,\n\n(9)\n\nthe LDOS is then given by\n1\nIm[G11 (r, r, i\u03c9n \u2192 \u03c9 + i0+ )\n2\u03c0\n\u2212 G22 (r, r, \u2212i\u03c9n \u2192 \u2212\u03c9 \u2212 i0+ )],\n\nD(r, \u03c9) = \u2212\n\n(10)\n\nwhere G\u03b1\u03b2 is an element of the 2\u00d72 Green's function matrix in (9), being Fourier-transformed to the Matsubarafrequency space\nZ \u03b2\n\u011c(ri , rj , i\u03c9n ) =\nd\u03c4 ei\u03c9n \u03c4 \u011c(ri , rj , \u03c4 ).\n(11)\n0\n\nFollowing the standard technique, the full \u011c in (9) can\nbe expanded in terms of HI given by (8),\n\u011c(ri , rj , \u03c4 ) = \u011c0 (ri , rj , \u03c4 )\nZ \u03b2\nX \u2020\nd\u03c41 hT\u03c4 \u0108i (\u03c4 )\n+\n\u0108k (\u03c41 )\u00fbkl \u0108l (\u03c41 )\u0108j\u2020 (0)i\n0\n\nk,l\n\n2\n\n+O(\u00fb ) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere, \u011c0 (ri , rj , \u03c4 ) \u2261 \u011c0 (ri \u2212 rj , \u03c4 ) is the mean-field\n\"non-interacting\" \u011c when HI = 0.\nThe terms included in HI in (3) are given explicitly\nhere. For BSCCO, we consider a square lattice of lattice\nconstant a. In the case of a single, extended and weak\nimpurity, we consider local deviations \u03b4t1 and \u03b4\u22061 which\ncouple the impurity site and its nearest neighbors, and\n\u03b4t2 and \u03b4\u22062 which couple the impurity's nearest neighbors and its next nearest neighbors.

Since we consider the weak impurity scattering\nlimit, \u011c in (12) is only calculated up to the first order\nof \u00fb (the Born limit). The first order term has already\nincluded the essential interference effect of the QPs. A\nstrong impurity is expected to give new features (such as\na bound state) only at the immediate neighborhood of\nthe impurity. Eq. (12) is then reduced to\n\u011c(ri , rj , i\u03c9n ) = \u011c0 (ri \u2212 rj , i\u03c9n )\nX\n+\n\u011c0 (ri \u2212 rk , i\u03c9n )\u00fbkl \u011c0 (rl \u2212 rj , i\u03c9n ).\n\n(14)\n\nk,l\n\nThe first term on the right is translationally invariant.\nSpatial variation of the LDOS at a fixed energy comes\nonly from the second term. It is related to the STM\nspectrum discussed in Ref. [5] via ri = rj = r and i\u03c9n \u2192\neV + i0+ , where e = |e| is the electron charge and V is\nthe bias voltage. Its Fourier transform is the FT-STM\nspectrum. We will be discussing the second term on the\nright throughout this paper.\nNote that the thermal Fermi distribution function\nnever appears in the full Green's function \u011c here. It\narises only when the Matsubara-frequency sum is involved, i.e., when the impurity is dynamic and inelastic\nscattering occurs. Since we have assumed an elastic impurity, our Green's function depends on temperature only\nthrough the gap magnitude \u2206(T ) which should change\nwith temperature.\nIn our calculation, we have used a 800\u00d7800 square lattice with the impurity at the center. We have chosen a\nsimple but reasonable impurity potential, 2\u03b4t1 = 4\u03b4t2 =\n\u22122\u03b4\u22061 = \u22124\u03b4\u22062 = V0 and have assumed that these\nscales are small and in the perturbative limit. For \u03bek ,\nwe use a tight-binding band, \u03bek = t1 (coskx + cosky )/2 +\nt2 coskx cosky + t3 (cos2kx + cos2ky )/2 + t4 (cos2kx cosky +\ncoskx cos2ky )/2 + t5 cos2kx cos2ky \u2212 \u03bc (lattice constant\na \u2261 1), with t1\u22125 = \u22120.60, 0.16, \u22120.05, \u22120.11, 0.05 eV\nand chemical potential \u03bc = \u22120.12 eV, appropriate for an\noptimally-doped BSCCO [12]. In addition, the superconducting gap is taken to be \u2206k = \u2206(T )(cos kx \u2212 cos ky )/2\nwith \u2206(T ) the temperature-dependent gap magnitude.\nBesides, we have introduced a finite broadening \u03b3 = 2\nmeV to the Green's function, such that eV + i0+ is replaced by eV + i\u03b3.\n\nto the normal state. At a distance of several lattice constants away from the impurity, oscillating Friedel stripes\nare seen in all panels, even in the case of normal states\n[\u2206(T ) = 0]. Spectra with a similar ratio of e|V |/\u2206(T )\nshare a similar behavior, such as those in Fig. 1(b), (c)\nwith e|V |/\u2206(T ) = 25/44, 15/26 \u223c 0.57. On the other\nhand, spectra at zero \u2206(T ) is robust at the change of\nV [see Fig. 1(g) and (h)]. Comparing the relative intensities of the modulations, we see that the strongest\nmodulations (at a fixed bias voltage) appear at temperatures near Tc . One more important feature to note is\nthat the different ripples live in well-separated patches of\nspace. The ripples do not have large-area overlaps.\nThe Fourier-transforms of the above spectra are given\nin Fig. 2. Roughly speaking, there are two regimes for\nthe spectra in the \u2206(T ) 6= 0 superconducting state, as\nclassified by the ratio e|V |/\u2206(T ). When e|V |/\u2206(T ) < 1,\nthere are local peaky structures that have their locations\ndescribable by the octet model [see Figs. 2(a)\u2013(c)], in\nagreement with previous studies [3,4]. Previous studies discussed the cases with different eV and a fixed\n\u2206(T ) \u2248 \u2206(0), while in our case \u2206(T ) is varied (by changing the temperature). In comparison of Fig. 2(b) and (c)\nthat have a similar ratio e|V |/\u2206(T ) \u223c 0.57, one again\nsees that the essential features of the spectra depend\nmainly on the ratio e|V |/\u2206(T ), as noted before in the discussion of the real-space spectra. In Fig. 3, a closer look\nof the locations of the interference peaks in Figs. 2(a)(c) is given. When e|V |/\u2206(T ) > 1 [see Figs. 2(d)-(f)],\nsome extra peaky structures beyond the description of\nthe octet model appear near q = 0. These new structures are not expected to be observable in real BSCCO\ncompound because they are related to the maximum gap\npart of the STM spectra (see discussion in Sec. IV), which\nin turn are highly inhomogeneous in space. As \u2206(T ) is\nfurther decreased, the strong peak at q = 0 is suppressed\nand vanishes at entering the normal state.\nIn the normal state, the FT-STM spectra are reduced\nto some neat ridges instead of peaks [see Figs. 2(g) and\n(h)], and they are rather robust against the change of\nbias. They should be readily observable in practice.\nAs the interference peaks in the dSC states (in the\nregime of e|V |/\u2206(T ) < 1) were well documented in the\nliterature [3,4], we will only give a supplementary comment on it in Appendix. In Sec. IV we pay special attention to the normal-state spectra.\n\nIII. STM AND FT-STM SPECTRA\n\nIV. ORIGIN OF THE NORMAL-STATE\nSPECTRA\n\nIn Fig. 1, we present the temperature evolution of the\nreal-space STM spectra at two different negative bias\nvoltages. The case of positive bias voltage will not be\ndiscussed as they are qualitatively the same. The gap\nmagnitudes are taken from \u2206(T = 0) = 44 to \u2206(Tc ) = 0\nmeV to simulate the transition from the superconducting\n\nIn this section, we show that the normal-state FT-STM\nspectra have an intimate relationship with the underlying\nFS.\nThe pronounced feature of the FT-STM in the dSC\nstate is that the peaks have locations depending on the\nbias. As long as the ratio e|V |/\u2206(T ) is small enough\n\n\fto stay away from the maximum gap region, locations\nof the peaks are more or less as described by the octet\nmodel [3] \u2013 a model that assumes the dominant QP scattering comes between regions of high DOS on the FS\n(the octets). These are regions with the smallest velocity,\nwhich appear at the tips of the banana-shape constant\nenergy contour (|\u03bek |2 +|\u2206k (T )|2 = constant). The agreement of the low-temperature experimental observation\nwith the picture was claimed to be good [5]. Later specific single-impurity scattering calculations [3,4] (similar\nto the one done in Sec. II) also supported this picture. In\nthe normal state, such large DOS octets no longer exist.\nHowever, we point out that there exists a different mechanism which can also cause a substantial joint-DOS, and\nleads to distinguished structures in the q space.\nThe upper panel of Fig. 4 shows a typical normal-state\nFT-STM spectrum in an extended Brillouin zone (BZ).\nThe underlying FS is also shown in the lower panel. Comparing the two panels, it is readily seen that the \"ridges\"\nin the spectrum are of the same shape as the FS, but\nhaving twice the size, and differently oriented branches\noverlap together. The occurrence of the ridges can be understood from the scattering wave vectors drawn in the\nlower panel. Those wave vectors, which are pivoted at\nq = (m\u03c0/a,n\u03c0/a), n, m \u2208 integer, are special in the sense\nthat they joint locally parallel segments of the FS, i.e.,\nthey possess a weak \"local-nesting\" [13] (such nesting is\nthe weakest possible type of nesting, or it is \"marginal\").\nAs a result, stripes in the real-space are still understood\nas due to the scattering on the FS.\nIn the normal state, there is no small and wellseparated large DOS regions, therefore the stripes in realspace are smoothly deformed unlike those in the dSC\nstate. An implication from the above understanding to\nthe dSC state is, the new structures at higher eV /\u2206(T )\nin Fig.2 (which were not seen by the experiment) come\nactually from the maximum gap regions. In either state,\nquasiparticles come from different directions vF to hit the\nimpurity, get bounced back, and get interfered with some\ntransition wave vector q. Since vF and q are not simply\nrelated, the orientations of the interference ripples in the\npatches of space are also not simply related to their orientations from the impurity. It is also obvious that within\nthe same patch of space there will be no two crossing ripples. Therefore, to explain the \"checkerboard\" pattern\n(overlapping ripples) seen in the experiments using this\npicture, one needs to consider the existence of a dilute\nconcentration of impurities in the system [14,15].\n\nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nOur perturbative approach should not be a concern regarding the validity of our discussion. In this paper, it\nis not our purpose to investigate the local bound states\nat the vicinity of the impurity. We are interested only\nin those regions remote from the impurity, where the in-\n\nterference between scattered quasiparticles is expected to\nbe the dominant process. The approach has included the\ninterference effect lucidly.\nIn the literature, it was proposed that temperature\ncould be a detrimental factor to the quasiparticles [9].\nIf this is true, the normal-state stripe described in this\npaper is expected to vanish. Stripes of a different origin\nmay exist [1], but they are likely to differ in many aspects,\nsuch as the orientation or temperature dependence of the\nstripes. In our case, the real-space normal-state stripes\n[14] and the corresponding ridges in the FT-STM spectra reflect the information of the entire Fermi surface.\nIf there are destructions of quasiparticle states at some\nFermi surface segments, the corresponding segments of\nthe ridges in the FT-STM spectrum should also be destroyed. The presence of a pseudogap in the normal state\nshould also be signified as some missing segments of the\nridges. Our study interpolates the dSC and normal-state\nSTM, using an approach supported by the experiment in\nthe dSC state. The \"fingerprints\" of the Fermi liquid under the STM probe, in the course of the superconductingto-normal transition, are enumerated for future experiments.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan under the Grant Nos. 92-2112-M-003-009\n(WCW) and 92-2811-M-007-027 (KKV and CYM).

[5]. If one considers the octet\nmodel in the dSC state more carefully, it will be interesting to note the existence of additional peaks, which are\nnot yet realized in current experimental data.\nIn Fig. 5, for a certain bias voltage, we have illustratively shown a few direct and Umklapp scattering\nwavevectors in the octet model [16]. In addition to the\nscattering vectors within the first Brillouin zone (direct),\nthere are also vectors connecting octets in different Brillouin zones (Umklapp). When all these vectors are taken\ninto account, there should exist FT-STM peaks as shown\nin the lower panel of the figure. Take an example, a new\npeak at the vector q5\u2032 is seen along the qy axis (when\nthe bias voltage exceeds some value). Peak at q5 was\nreported by Ref. [5], but the corresponding q5\u2032 peak was\nnot. The more disturbing matter is, there also exists a q4\u2032\npeak which may come close to q2,6 peaks (or vice versa\nspeaking).\nIt may seem at odds that a mathematical Fourier transform of experimental data on a discrete lattice does not\n\n\fautomatically possess the Umklapp symmetry. The reason may be due to the fact that practical STM actually\nprobes a space more continuous than the underlying lattice. It scans in steps smaller than the lattice constants,\nand identifies the locations of individual atoms only later,\nby looking at the modulation profile. The probe tip does\nnot jump from one atom to another right on-top!\n\n[1] S.A. Kivelson et al., cond-mat/0210683.\n[2] S. Sachdev, Rev. Mod. Phys. 75, 913 (2003).\n[3] Q.-H. Wang and D.H. Lee, Phys.

[7] might be due to the bilayer splitting\nof the electronic bands in the BSCCO compounds. The\nbilayer splitting [\u223c (coskx \u2212 cosky )2 ] is more prominent\nat near the antinodes, and may give rise to splitted FTSTM peaks, while some of them could be less dispersive\nat higher biases.\n[9] J.

Ding, and J.C.Campuzano, Phys. Rev. B\n52, 615 (1994).\n[13] Such local-nesting effect is similar to the mechanism leads\nto the incommensurate peaks observed by the inelastic\nneutron scattering (INS) in LSCO or YBCO (see e.g.,\nK.-K. Voo et al., Physica C 382, 323 (2002); condmat/0006312 and references therein). However, in the\ndSC state, local-nesting effect in the INS is energy dependent and gives rise to energy-dependent peak locations.\n[14] In a real material, the real-space spectra may be seen as\nsome crossing superpositions of stripes due to individual\nimpurities, showing some \"checkerboard\" pattern. It was\nfirst pointed out by us in cond-mat/0302473 [published\nin Phys. Rev. B 68, 012505 (2003)] that the existence of\ndilute impurities is crucial in relating this kind of calculation to the experimentally observed checkerboard pattern.\n[15] L. Zhu, W.A. Atkinson, and P.J. Hirschfeld, condmat/0307228.\n[16] For easy comparison, our notations are chosen in a way\ncorresponding to those in Ref. [5].\n\nFIG. 1.

The values of xl and xu are specified at the bottom of\neach panel, and the color scales are shown at the bottom of\nthe figure.\n\nFIG. 3.

It is seen that\nFigs. 2(b) and (c), which have a similar e|V |/\u2206(T ) ratio, have\nsimilar peak positions and intensities. For easier comparison,\nthe intensity of the spectrum in Fig. 2(a) is enlarged by a\nfactor of 2.\n\nFIG. 4. (Upper panel) The FT-STM spectrum of a normal-state system at a bias of -23 mV.
