Furthermore, renewed interest to particle momentum\nevaluation on the basis of precise measurements of multiple scattering effect\n(utilising the scales and coordinate accuracies of novel muon and neutrino\ndetectors) calls for adequate accuracies in the theoretical description of the\nphenomenon.\nSeveral multiple scattering theories have been published (see review [1])\nwhich are concerned with angular distribution of particles passing without\nsubstantial loss of energy \u2206E \u226a E using the small-angle approximation of\nscattering angle \u03c7. This approximation assumes that \u03c7 is small and consists\nin replacing sin(\u03c7) \u2248 tan(\u03c7) \u2248 \u03c7 and the upper limit \u03c0 for \u03c7 by infinity.\nGaussian distribution function is widely used for various estimations, however\nit can hardly serve as a satisfactory tool for consideration of low probability region (large deflection angles), especially at moderate absorber thickness.\nOn the other hand, Moliere theory [2],[3] of multiple scattering, the results\nof which are employed nowadays in most of the transport codes, cannot be\nused for description of high-energy muon scattering either. The reason is that,\ndue to its lagre mass, muon is capable of passing large thicknesses of material,\nand hence the probability of scatters with impact parameters comparable with\nnuclear size is not small. Moliere theory (as well as other approaches developed within the point-like nucleus approximation) heavily overestimates the\nprobability of large angle deflections.\nSeveral calculations have been carried out to take into account the charge\ndistribution in nucleus. Two methods [4] for evaluating multiple scattering on\nextended nuclei were given, one of which is of interest as a general method for\nany charge distribution. The expression for angular distribution was obtained\nin Ref.[5] under the assumption that the charge distribution in nuclei and proton is Gaussian. Unfortunately, there are several misprints in the work [5].\nMoliere theory regarded elastic collisions against the screened Coulomb\nfield of atomic nuclei only. Collisions with Z atomic electrons also contribute\nto multiple scattering, especially in light elements. This effect is often introduced by replacing Z 2 with Z(Z + 1), which serves only to estimate the order\nof magnitude of the effect of inelastic scattering. The account of inelastic collisions in the Moliere theory has been done in Ref.[6] for electrons and heavy\nparticles.\nIn this paper, we present two methods for calculation of the muon angular\n2\n\n\fdistribution function due to multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) in matter.\nThe procedures take into account the nuclear size effect and contribution of\nincoherent scattering on atomic electrons.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.2, we give the general relations and definitions used for description of multiple scattering of muons in\nthe field of atoms. A mixed Monte Carlo approach to the MCS consideration is described in Sec.3. In Sec.4, contribution of incoherent scattering on\natomic electrons and the multiple scattering in mixtures and compounds are\ndiscussed. Basic expressions of Moliere multiple scattering theory are given in\nSec.5, whereas the equations of modified Moliere theory taking into account\nnuclear size effect are described in Sec.6. At the end of this section, we compare the angular distributions of muons obtained by Monte Carlo method and\nanalytically. In the conclusion, the main results of the paper are summarized.\n\n2\n\nGeneral relations and definitions\n\nDifferential cross section (per gram of matter) for scattering in Coulomb\nfield of nuclei in the small angle approximation can be written as follows [7]:\nZ2\nd\u03c30 (\u03c7) = 8\u03c0NAv\nA\n\ne2\npv\n\n!2\n\nZ2\nd\u03c7\n= 8\u03c0NAv\n\u03c73\nA\n\nre me\np\u03b2\n\n!2\n\nd\u03c7\n,\n\u03c73\n\n(1)\n\nwhere NAv is the Avogadro number, A is the atomic weight, p and v are\nmomentum and velocity of the particle, respectively. In the second relation,\nclassical electron radius re and electron mass me are utilised as natural units of\ndistance and energy. Hereafter, whenever it does not cause misunderstanding,\nwe assume h\u0304 = c = 1. For high-energy (E \u223c p, \u03b2 \u223c 1) muon scattering on\nheavy target through small angles, the transverse momentum transferred to\nthe particle q = E\u03c7, and practically coincides with the total 3-dimensional\nmomentum transfer. The cross section may be re-written as:\nd\u03c30 (q) = 8\u03c0NAv\n\nZ2\ndq\n(re me )2 3 .\nA\nq\n\n(2)\n\nNoteworthy, in this ultrarelativistic regime the cross section depends only\non transverse momentum and not on the particle energy. The integral cross\nsection for scattering with transverse momenta greater than q is:\nZ2\n\u03c30int (q) = 4\u03c0NAv\nA\n\nre me\nq\n\n!2\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\n3\n\n\fDifferential cross section for extended nuclei (taking into account also atomic\nscreening) in the Born approximation may be described by means of formfactors:\n\u001b\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n2\n2\n1 \u2212 FN Fp ,\nd\u03c3(q) = d\u03c30 (q) (FN \u2212 Fa ) +\nZ\n\u001a\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Fa (q), FN (q), and Fp (q) are elastic atomic, nuclear, and proton formfactors, respectively. The second term in braces represents the (order-of-magnitude)\ncorrection for quasi-elastic processes (with excitation or disintegration of the\nnucleus), if incoherent scattering of the projectile on individual protons inside\nnucleus occurs. For hydrogen (Z =1) this term should be omitted.\nFormfactors are normalised in such a way that F (0) = 1 and F (\u221e) = 0. A\nbig difference between the sizes of atom and nucleus allows, as a rule, to consider the influence of atomic and nuclear formfactor separately: in the region\nwhere Fa is essential, FN = 1; on the contrary, when FN appreciably deviates\nfrom the unit, Fa is negligibly small. Hence, in a wide range of momentum\ntransfers (two - three orders of magnitude, depending on the substance), and,\nas a consequence, over 4 - 5 decades in interaction frequency determined by\nEq.(3), individual scatters obey a simple Rutherford law.\nThe functional dependence of the formfactors is determined by the charge\ndensity distribution inside the object. For light and medium nuclei, a sufficiently good description may be reached on the basis of two-parameter distribution function suggested by Fermi. However, the use of accurate charge\ndistributions entails serious computational difficulties and cannot be done in\nanalytical form. Therefore, reasonable approximations are often used (for example, Gaussian or exponential distribution of charge density). For consideration of multiple scattering process, such approximations are justified by the\nfact that at moderate transferred momenta the same expansion can be written\nfor all formfactors\nFN (q) \u2243 1 \u2212 (qRN )2 /6,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere RN is rms radius of charge distribution. An appreciable difference between different formfactors appears only in rare collisions with large q. Analytically, within the framework of Born approximation [8]\n(qRN )2\nFN (q) = exp \u2212\n6\n\"\n\n#\n\n(qRN )2\nand FN (q) = 1 +\n12\n\"\n\n#\u22122\n\n(6)\n\nfor Gaussian and exponential charge distributions, respectively. Rms-radii for\npractically all elements (and, moreover, for numerous isotopes) can be found\nelsewhere (e.g., see the compillation in Ref.[9]). For light and medium nuclei,\n4\n\n\fthe A-dependence of RN may be parameterized as\nRN = 1.27A0.27 fm or qN = 1/RN = 155A\u22120.27 MeV.\n\n(7)\n\nFor proton, Rp = 0.85 fm, and qp = 232 MeV.\nThe important parameter in consideration of multiple scattering phenomenon is a so-called characteristic value qc of transverse momentum, which\ndetermines on the average one scatter with q > qc at a given layer thickness\nX(g/cm2 ):\nqc2 = 4\u03c0NAv\n\nZ2\n(re me )2 X.\nA\n\n(8)\n\nSometimes, the following regions are distinguished in the scattering process:\nmultiple scattering (q \u226a qc , numerous scatters), plural scattering (several,\nbut few, scatters with q \u223c qc ), and single scattering (low probability scatters\nwith q \u226b qc ); in the latter domain, scattering angle distribution function approaches the behaviour of the differential cross section.\nStatistical consideration of multiple scattering is appropriate when qc \u226b\n1/Ra , where Ra is the effective radius of the atomic electron charge distribution:\n183Z \u22121/3\n.\nRa = 1/qa =\n2.718me\n\n(9)\n\nHence, the applicability of theory is usually limited to thickness of layers:\nX \u226b 4 * 10\u22124 A/Z 4/3 g/cm2 .\n\n3\n\n(10)\n\nMonte Carlo approach\n\nThe idea of MCS consideration by means of a mixed Monte Carlo technique\n(see, e.g., Ref.[10]) consists in the separation of multiple scattering through\nsmall angles, or with small transferred momenta (which are treated in Gaussian approximation), and of scatters in the region of large q, which are simulated explicitely. This approach can be conveniently used for calculations\nwith accurate cross section in high q region (in particular, including nuclear\nformfactors). The boundary qb between these two domains has to satisfy the\nfollowing inequalities:\nqa \u226a qb \u226a qN ;\n\nqb \u2264 qc .\n\n(11)\n5\n\n\fThe first of these two conditions ensures Rutherford behaviour of the cross\nsection around qb , while the second one provides the regime of plural or multiple interactions for scatters that are simulated individually.\nIn order to calculate the rms-deviation for small angle scatters with q < qb ,\nwhich are treated in a \"continuous\" way, the following integral has to be evaluated:\nZqb\n0\n\n[1 \u2212 Fa (q)]2\n\ndq\n.\nq\n\n(12)\n\nA similar integral comes into cross section formulae for many electromagnetic\ninteraction processes (for example, radiation logarithm in the bremsstrahlung),\nand a ready result of work [11] can be used. In the frame of the Thomas-Fermi\nmodel, one can find for the \"restricted\" value of squared transverse momentum\naccumulated in the layer X of matter:\n2\n\nhQ irstr = 8\u03c0NAv (re me )\n\n2Z\n\n2\n\nA\n\n\u0014\n\nX ln KZ\n\n\u22121/3\n\nqb\n+ ln\n\u22121 ,\nme\n\u0015\n\n(13)\n\nwhere K=183. Using Eq.(8) and Eq.(9), we can re-write the latter relation as\nhQ2 irstr = 2qc2 ln\n\nqb\n.\nqa\n\n(14)\n\nFor light and medium elements, Thomas-Fermi model of the atom does not\nprovide high accuracy. For example, for hydrogen it is necessary to take\nK =202.4; the values of K for various elements calculated with Hartree-Fock\nmodel may be found elsewhere [12].\nRandom scatters with q > qb are simulated by means of a usual technique,\nwith the mean free path defined by the integral cross section (3). Random q\u03c2\nare sampled as\n\u221a\nq\u03c2 = qb / \u03c2,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c2 is a random number with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1; q\u03c2\nis accepted with a probability equal to the combined nuclear formfactor FN2\n(including elastic and quasielastic terms):\nP (q\u03c2 ) = FN2 = FN2 +\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n1 \u2212 FN2 Fp2 .\nZ\n\n(16)\n\nAgain, similar to Eq.(4), only the first term remains for hydrogen (with nuclear formfactor equal to that of proton).\n6\n\n\fAlthough the consistency of the approach based on the partition of individual scatters into \"continuous\" (q < qb ) and \"discrete\" (q > qb ) parts\nis almost obvious, we have performed comparative calculations for different\nthicknesses of absorber (1 cm and 100 cm iron), each with two substantially\ndifferent values of qb (0.1 and 1 MeV for thin absorber, 1 and 10 MeV for\nthick layer); 106 muons for the lower value of qb and 108 for the higher one\nhave been traced. Noteworthy, the number of simulated individually scatters\n(per muon) varies as 1/qb2 (see Eq.(3)), and hence it was 100 times different\n(about 15 per layer for the higher value of the threshold and \u223c 1500 for the\nlower one).\nDifferential distributions of events in the value of accumulated transverse\nmomentum Q are shown in Figs.1 and 2 for 1 cm and 100 cm iron targets,\nrespectively. A big difference between calculation results for point-like and\nfinite-size nucleus is obvious already for 1 cm layer. One the other hand, the\nresults obtained with different boundary values qb agree within the statistical\naccuracy in the whole range of angular deviations.\nMonte Carlo approach allows to easily probe different models of the nuclear\nformfactor. In Fig.3, comparison of calculation results obtained for several versions of the formfactor is given. Integral distributions in Q (i.e. probabilities\nof the deflection at angles greater than Q/E) after passing 100 cm iron layer\nare presented. Solid curves (bottom to top) in the figure correspond to: Gaussian charge distribution in nucleus, incoherent scattering on protons being\nneglected (i.e., the second term in Eq.(16) is omitted); Gaussian charge distribution both in nucleus and in proton; exponential distribution for nucleus and\nproton; exponential model for nucleus with proton taken as a point-like object\n(Fp =1). With the exception of unrealistic extreme cases, calculation results\nare not very sensitive to the choice of a specific formfactor model. At the same\ntime, the difference with the calculations performed for a point-like nucleus\n(dashed curve in the figure) is very big, and reaches the orders of magnitude\nin the probability of large deflections.\nThe total average value of squared transverse momentum accumulated\nin the layer can be obtained, if we add the contribution of large deflections\n(q > qb ) to the restricted value given by Eq.(14). For Gaussian charge distribution, such evaluation can be easily performed analytically:\n2\n\nhQ i =\n\n2qc2\n\n\"\n\nqp2\n1.2978qN\n1\nln\n+\nln 1 + 2\nqa\n2Z\nqN\n\n!#\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere qN , qp , qc , and qa are defined by Eqs.(7)-(9). The average contribution\nof quasielastic processes (the second term in brackets) is small even for light\nelements; for example, in carbon the rms-deviation increases by only 1%. However, these interactions have to be taken into account for adequate description\nof the distribution function in the tail region (see Fig.3).\nFor three-dimensional calculations, when both angular deviation and lat7\n\n\feral displacement of muon are of interest, the restricted contribution (of q < qb )\ncan also be calculated in a Gaussian approximation, but taking into account\nthe well-known correlation between the angle and the displacement [13].\n\n4\n\nAtomic electron contribution; mixtures and compounds\n\nContribution of incoherent scattering on atomic electrons is often taken\ninto account by means of a substitution of Z 2 by Z(Z + 1) in basic relations\n(for differential cross section, some parameters of the theory, etc.). However,\nthis substitution is rather inaccurate, since, firstly, the cross section at small\nangles (and low momenta) is determined in this case by the inelastic atomic\nformfactor (with different q-dependence and different characteristic radius of\nthe atom). Secondly, due to light electron mass, kinematics of the process (in\nlaboratory frame) appreciably changes. That leads to the appearance of the\nupper limit on transverse momentum and on deflection angle, and to an appreciable probability to loose large fraction of muon energy in a single collision.\nOf course, target size corrections for scattering on electrons are irrelevant.\nConsideration of kinematics of muon scattering on a free electron gives\nthe following expression for the transverse momentum q\nq=\n\nq\n\n2me T (1 \u2212 T /Tm ),\n\n(18)\n\nwhere T and Tm are kinetic energy transferred to the electron (initially at\nrest) in the collision and the maximal value of this energy:\nTm = 2me p2 /(m2e + m2\u03bc + 2me E).\n\n(19)\n\nThe accumulated squared transverse momentum in the layer X may be evaluated similar to Eq.(13), combining the contribution of low-q region (where\nthe inelastic atomic formfactor is important) and of high-q domain. In the latter case, hQ2 i is easily calculated by means of the convolution of the squared\nvalue of q ( Eq.(18)) and the differential cross section of knock-on electron\nproduction. In this way, we obtain the following relation:\ns\n\n\"\n\nZ\n2Tm\nhQ i = 8\u03c0NAv X(re me )2 ln K \u2032 Z \u22122/3\nA\nme\n2\n\n!\n\n#\n\n7\n\u2212\n.\n4\n\n(20)\n\nWithin the Thomas-Fermi model, K \u2032 =1429; an accurate value for hydrogen is\nK \u2032 =446. Small corrections which correspond to spin terms in the cross section\nof muon-electron scattering are omitted for simplicity.\nRare catastrophic collisions with large energy transfers are also included in\n8\n\n\fhQ2 i calculations (Eq.(20)) on the average. For simulation of muon transport\nin thick layers, such collisions are usually treated separately (with explicit\nsimulation of kinematic variables). The average accumulated Q2 in collisions\nwith energy transfers less than a certain cut Tc (Tc \u2264 Tm ) is given by\n2\n\nhQ irstr\n\ns\n\n\"\n\n2Tc\nZ\n= 8\u03c0NAv X(re me )2 ln K \u2032 Z \u22122/3\nA\nme\n\n!\n\nTc\nT2\n\u22121\u2212\n+ c2 .(21)\nTm 4Tm\n#\n\nMultiple scattering on the electrons represents only a correction to the scattering on nuclei, and maximal transverse momenta and deflection angles are\nsmall. Therefore it seems justified to introduce this correction on the basis of\na Gaussian approximation (for example, as an addition of contribution given\nby Eq.(21) to the restricted value of accumulated Q2 on nuclei defined by\nEq.(13)). Such procedure allows to avoid double counting of the collisions\nwith energy transfers T > Tc , which will appear if multiple scattering process\nand knock-on electron production are simulated incoherently.\nAs a general prescription, for calculation of multiple scattering in mixtures or compounds, the differential cross sections Eq.(4) for elements have\nto be averaged with weights Wi corresponding to relative mass abundance of\nindividual entries.\nWithin the framework of a mixed Monte Carlo approach described above,\nthis leads to: (i) summation of restricted accumulated Q2 -values with weights\nWi ; (ii) description of the cross section in the intermediate region (qa \u226a q \u226a\nqN ) with the average parameter hZ 2 /Ai (and, hence, of the integral cross section for q > qb with the same factor); (iii) averaging of the acceptance function\nEq.(16) for sampling of random momenta q\u03c2 > qb :\nn\nX\n\nZ2\n1\nWi i FN2 i + (1 \u2212 FN2 i )Fp2\nP (q\u03c2 ) =\nAi\nZi\ni=1\n\u001a\n\n\u001b, X\nn\ni=1\n\nWi\n\nZi2\n.\nAi\n\n(22)\n\nHere, FN i (q\u03c2 ) denotes the elastic nuclear formfactor for the i-th element of\nthe mixture. For hydrogen, the expression in braces reduces to the first term\n(see also comments after Eqs.(4) and (16)). Similarly, the contribution of the\nscattering on atomic electrons is determined by the weighted sum of partial\ncontributions defined by Eqs.(20) or (21), for total or restricted (with T < Tc )\naccumulated Q2 values, respectively.\n\n5\n\nMoliere's equations\n\nIn this section, we give the main equations of the Moliere's multiple scattering theory where the nucleus is treated as a point-like charge.\n9\n\n\fLet f (\u03b8, t) be spatial-angle distribution function, i.e. for small-angle approximation f (\u03b8, t) it is the number of charged particles in the angular interval\nof polar angle \u03b8 \u00f7 \u03b8 + d\u03b8 after traversing a thickness of t.

For thick layer of matter (\u03c4A2 and \u03c4p2 \u226a 1), the assymptotic of\nEq.(42) is Gaussian [5]:\n\nf \u0303M (\u03b8, \u03c4 ) \u2243\n\nZ\u221e\n\nJ0 (\u03b7\u03b8) e\u2212\u03bc\u03b7\n\n2 /4\n\n\u03b7 d\u03b7 =\n\n0\n\n2 \u2212\u03b82 /\u03bc\ne\n,\n\u03bc\n\n(49)\n\nwhere\n\u03c42\n1\n2 \u2212 C \u2212 ln \u03c4A2 \u2212 Z \u22121 ln p2 .\n\u03bc=1\u2212\nB\n\u03c4A\n#\n\n\"\n\n(50)\n\nIf the mixture of n different scatterers is present, the characteristic angle\n\u03c7c is given by\n\u03c72c\n\nn\nX\n4\u03c0e4\nwi Zi2\n= 2 NAv \u03c1t\np\ni=1\n\n,\n\nn\nX\n\nwi Ai ,\n\n(51)\n\ni=1\n\nand the integral angular distribution function P (\u03b8, t) is defined by\nP (\u03b8, t) =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nwi Zi2 Pi (\u03b8, t)\n\n,\n\nn\nX\n\nwi Zi2 ,\n\n(52)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the subscript i denotes the atomic species and weight wi is proportional\nto the number of atoms of the i-th element in the mixture.\nThe integral angular distributions on nuclei as a function of the transverse\nmomentum Q calculated by the mixed Monte Carlo tecnhique and analytically\nEq.(46) are shown in Fig.4 (iron targets of 1 cm and 100 cm) and in Fig.5 (water thickness of 1000 cm). The results are in good agreement. Moliere angular\ndistributions are shown also for comparison. A minor difference between analytical and Monte Carlo calculations in the tails of the curves is conditioned by\na different choice of the proton formfactor (Gaussian charge distribution with\nRp = 0.80 fm in analytical evaluation and exponential one with Rp = 0.85 fm\nin Monte Carlo simulation.\n14\n\n\f7\n\nConclusions\n\nA high-energy muon is capable to cross very thick layers of material and its\nde Broglie wave is comparable with nuclear dimensions. Hence, the probability\nof scatters with impact parameter of the order of nuclear radius ( scatters with\nlarge angles) is not small. For such interactions, the law of single scattering\nhas to be modifed significantly to take into account the finite size of charge\ndistribution in the nuclei. Nuclear size effects can be desribed by multiplying\nthe Rutherford cross section by a nuclear formfactor FN2 , which goes to 1 for\nlarge impact parameters and vanished at very large transverse momenta.\nWe have presented two methods for calculating the multiple scattering\ndistribution for muons traversing a thick scatterer. The mixed Monte Carlo\ntechnique and modified Moliere's theory of MCS take into account the nuclear\nsize effect. Parametrisation of A-dependence of rms-radii for light and medium\nnuclei is given. The results of two methods are in good agreement, and show\nthat the muon angular distribution is similar to Moliere distribution after\npassing through small thickness of material and moderate deflection angles.\nHowever at large thickness of scatterer, the angular distribution is drastically\nchanged by the influence of the nuclear formfactor. So, in this case the Moliere\ntheory heavily overestimates the probability of large angle deflections. Contribution of incoherent scattering on atomic electrons is also correctly taken\ninto account.\nA necessity of taking into account nucleus size effect as well as incoherent\nscattering on atomic electrons when describing the muon scattering at large\nangles in thick matter layers is shown. Neither Gaussian approximation of\nmultiple scattering distribution nor Moliere theory can be used for accurate\ndescription of high-energy muon transport in a wide range of the thicknesses\nof material.\n\nAcknowledgements\nAuthors are indebted to A.A.
