Curved A\u221e -algebras appear in nature as deformations of dg algebras. We develop the basic theory of curved A\u221e -algebras and, in particular,\ncurved dg algebras. We investigate their link with a suitable class of dg coalgebras via the bar construction and produce Quillen model structures on their\nmodule categories. We define the analogue of the relative derived category for\na curved dg algebra.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Motivation: deformations of dg categories. The infinitesimal deformation theory of abelian categories and their Hochschild cohomology have recently\nbeen established by Wendy T. Lowen and Michel Van den Bergh [33, 32]. This\ntheory is motivated by non commutative algebraic geometry and in particular the\nneed to give a theoretical framework for the ad hoc arguments used in the construction of important classes of non commutative projective varieties. The further\ndevelopment of this theory requires a good understanding of the deformation theory\nof 'non commutative schemes'. These can be modeled by differential graded (=dg)\ncategories [7, 43, 28, 29], and this is the motivation for this paper. The initial observation is that the full Hochschild complex of a dg algebra does not parametrize\nthe deformations in the category of dg algebras but rather in the category of curved\nA\u221e -algebras, which we also call A[0,\u221e[ -algebras. Key examples of these are curved\ndg algebras, i.e. graded algebras endowed with a degree one derivation whose square\nis not necessarily zero but equals the commutator with a given element of degree\n2. These algebras were introduced by L. E. Positsel'ski\u0131\u0306 [37], who showed that they\noccur in nature when one generalizes Koszul duality to non homogeneous quadratic\nalgebras.\nA[0,\u221e[ -algebras appear in the work of Ezra Getzler and John D. S. Jones [11]\nand the work of Ezra Getzler, John D. S. Jones and Scott Petrack [12] on S 1 equivariant differential forms on the free loop space of a smooth manifold, in the\nwork of Gunnar Fl\u00f8ystad [8] on Koszul duality and in the work of Alberto S.\nCattaneo and Giovanni Felder [3] on the relative version of Kontsevich's formality\ntheorem. In Physics, curved dg algebras appear in the work of Albert Schwarz\n[40, 41] as noncommutative generalizations of Q-manifolds, in the work of Anton\nKapustin and Yi Li [19, 20] on topological D-branes in Landau-Ginzburg models,\nin the work of Hiroshige Kajiura [18] on deformation of holomorphic line bundles\nDate: February 7, 2008.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 18E30, 18G25, 18E35, 18E10, 55U35, 18G10,\n16W30, 16W50, 16S80, 16E40.\nKey words and phrases. curved A-infinity structure, derived category, Frobenius category,\nQuillen model category, relative derived category, weak A-infinity structure.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPEDRO NICOL\u00c1S\n\nover higher dimensional complex tori, in the work of Xiang Tang [42] on strict\nquantization . . .\n1.2. Contents. The aim of this paper is to develop the basic theory of curved A\u221e algebras and curved dg algebras, their module categories, their link with a suitable\nclass of dg coalgebras via the bar construction, and to investigate the analogue of\nthe relative derived category for a curved dg algebra.\nMore precisely, we extend certain results on A\u221e -algebras and their modules\nobtained in [31] in two directions:\n- instead of working over a field we work over an arbitrary commutative\nground ring;\n- instead of considering A\u221e -algebras and dg algebras we more generally consider A[0,\u221e[ -algebras and curved dg algebras.\nOur results concern the bar/cobar adjunction for algebras and modules and the\nexistence of Quillen model structures on suitable categories of modules.\nIn section 3, we study how to construct certain Quillen model structures (cf.\n[17, 16]) in Frobenius categories (cf. [23]) inspired by the techniques of [17, Section\n2.3]. In particular, let\nOC\nL\n\nR\n\nD\n\n\u000f\n\nbe an adjoint pair of functors and let \u03b7 : 1 \u2192 RL and \u03b4 : LR \u2192 1 be the adjunction\nmorphisms. Assume that C and D are Frobenius categories and L and R are exact\nfunctors (and so they preserve injectives). Put WC (resp. WD ) for the class of\nmorphisms of C (resp. D) mapped to a stable isomorphism by R (resp. L). We\nprove that if R(\u03b4M ) and L(\u03b7N ) are stable isomorphisms, then\na) There is a model structure in C (resp. in D) having WC (resp. WD ) as the class\nof weak equivalences. In some sense, these are the minimal model structures\nsuch that the morphism \u03b4M : LRM \u2192 M is a cofibrant approximation and\n\u03b7N : N \u2192 RLN is a fibrant approximation.\n\u22121\nb) The localizations C[WC\u22121 ] and D[WD\n] exist and they are triangulated quotients\nof the corresponding stable categories. The pair of adjoint functors (L, R) induces mutually quasi-inverse triangulated equivalences\nC[WC\u22121 ]\nO\n\u000f\n\u22121\nD[WD\n]\nc) If both C and D have finite direct limits and colimits, then they are model\ncategories endowed with those model structures, and the pair of adjoint functors\n(L, R) is a Quillen equivalence.\nd) If C has kernels and D has cokernels, then they are relevant derivable categories\n(cf. [6]) and the pair of adjoint functors (L, R) induces mutually quasi-inverse\nequivalences between the corresponding derivators (cf. [34, 35]).\n\n\fTHE BAR DERIVED CATEGORY OF A CURVED DG ALGEBRA\n\n3\n\nIn sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 we extend the bar/cobar formalism (cf. [31] for this\nformalism in the absence of the curvature, and [37, 11, 3] for some of this formalism in the presence of a non vanishing curvature) to A[0,\u221e[ -algebras and their\nmodules, stressing the importance of Maurer-Cartan equations. It turns out that\nthese constructions somehow behave more naturally when applied to a dg algebra\nnot regarded as without curvature but rather as a curved dg algebra with zero\ncurvature. In section 4, we give the basic definitions concerning A[0,\u221e[ -algebras,\nintroduce the cocomplete graded-augmented counital dg coalgebras and present the\nbar construction of an A[0,\u221e[ -algebra A as a representative of the functor which\ntakes such a coalgebra C to the set of 'twisting cochains' Tw(C, A). In section 5, we\ndefine the cobar construction of a cocomplete graded-augmented counital dg coalgebra C as a corepresentative of the functor which takes a curved dg algebra A to the\nset of 'twisting cochains' Tw(C, A). It is a left adjoint to the restriction of the bar\nconstruction to the category of curved dg algebras. In particular, for each A[0,\u221e[ algebra A, we have a canonical curved dg algebra \u03a9BA and a natural morphism of\nA[0,\u221e[ -algebras A \u2192 \u03a9BA universal among the morphisms of A[0,\u221e[ -algebras from\nA to a curved dg algebra. In section 6, we present the basic definitions concerning\nA[0,\u221e[ -modules, define the 'linearized' Maurer-Cartan equation of an A[0,\u221e[ -module\nand construct (in great generality) the bar construction of an A[0,\u221e[ -module M as\na representative of a functor which takes certain comodules N to the 'linearized'\nMaurer-Cartan equation of an A[0,\u221e[ -module defined from M and N . In section\n7, we define the cobar construction of a counital dg comodule N as a corepresentative of the functor which takes a unital curved dg module M to the 'linearized'\nMaurer-Cartan equation of a curved dg module defined from M and N . This is\na left adjoint of the restriction of the bar construction to the category of unital\ncurved dg modules. From this adjunction we introduce in section 8 the bar derived\ncategory of a unital curved dg algebra as a certain homotopy category, by using\nsome results of section 3. In section 9, we prove that the bar derived category of a\ncurved dg algebra with zero curvature is the relative derived category (cf. [24]) of\nthe underlying dg algebra. In particular, this gives a model structure for the relative\nderived category, proves that the bar derived category of a dg algebra over a field\ncoincides with the classical derived category and allows us a better comprehension\nof Kenji Lef\u00e8vre-Hasegawa's theorem [31, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 2.2.2.2]. Some results of [31]\nsuggest that the spirit of A\u221e -theory is to replace quasi-isomorphisms by homotopy\nequivalences, up to increasing the amount of morphisms and/or objects. In section\n10, we show that the A\u221e -theory over an arbitrary commutative ring still allows\nus to describe the relative derived category of an augmented dg algebra A as the\ncategory of unital dg A-modules, with (strictly unital) morphisms of A\u221e -modules,\nup to (strictly unital) homotopy equivalences of A\u221e -modules.\n\n1.3.

Notation\nUnless otherwise stated, k will be a commutative (associative, unital) ring. Also,\n'graded' will always mean 'Z-graded'. If V is a graded k-module, i.e.\nM\nV =\nVp,\np\u2208Z\n\nwe denote by SV or V [1] the graded k-module with (SV )p = V p+1 for all p \u2208 Z.\nWe call SV the suspension or the shift of V . The shift extends to an automorphism\nof the category of graded k-modules, with inverse denoted by S \u22121 . Notice that,\ngiven a graded k-module V , we have two homogeneous morphisms s : V \u2192 SV and\nw : V \u2192 S \u22121 V , of degree \u22121 and 1 respectively.\nIf f : U \u2192 U \u2032 and g : V \u2192 V \u2032 are homogeneous morphisms between graded\nk-modules, their tensor product\nf \u2297 g : U \u2297 V \u2192 U\u2032 \u2297 V \u2032\nis defined using the Koszul sign rule: We have\n(f \u2297 g)(u \u2297 v) = (\u22121)|g|*|u| f (u) \u2297 g(v)\n\nfor all homogeneous elements v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W , where |g| and |v| are the degrees\nof g and v, respectively.\nAn exact category in the sense of Quillen [39] is an additive category C endowed\nwith a distinguished class E of sequences\ni\n\np\n\nX \u2192 Y \u2192 Z,\nclosed under isomorphisms such that (i, p) is an exact pair, i.e. i is the kernel of\np and p is the cokernel of i. Following [9], the morphisms p are called deflations,\nthe morphisms i inflations and the pairs (i, p) conflations. The class of conflations\nhave to satisfy the following axioms:\nEx0 ) The identity morphism of the zero object is a deflation.\nEx1 ) The composition of two deflations is a deflation.\nEx1') The composition of two inflations is an inflation.\nEx2 ) Deflations admit and are stable under base change.\nEx2') Inflations admit and are stable under cobase change.\nAs shown by B. Keller [22], these axioms are equivalent to Quillen's and they imply\nthat if C is small, then there is a fully faithful functor from C into an ambient\nabelian category C \u2032 whose image is an additive subcategory closed under extensions\nand such that a sequence of C is a conflation if and only if its image is a short exact\nsequence of C \u2032 . Conversely, one easily checks that an extension closed full additive\nsubcategory C of an abelian category C \u2032 endowed with all exact pairs which induce\nshort exact sequences in C \u2032 is always exact.\nA Frobenius category is an exact category C with enough E-injectives and enough\nE-projectives and where the class of E-projectives coincides with the class of Einjectives. In this case, the stable category C obtained by dividing C by the ideal of\nmorphisms factoring through an E-projective-injective carries a canonical structure\nof triangulated category, cf. [15, 14, 21, 10]. We write f for the image in C of a\nmorphism f of C. The suspension or shift functor S of C is obtained by choosing a\nconflation\npX\niX\nIX \u2192 SX\nX\u2192\n\n\fTHE BAR DERIVED CATEGORY OF A CURVED DG ALGEBRA\n\n5\n\nfor each object X, where IX is required to be E-injective.

However,\nour notion of model structure is weaker than that of [17] since we do not impose\nfunctorial factorizations. We will say that a model structure on a category C is\nthe data of three classes of morphisms, W , Cof and F ib, the weak equivalences,\ncofibrations and fibrations respectively, satisfying the following axioms:\n1) (2-out-of-3) If f and g are morphisms of C such that gf is defined and two of\nf, g and gf are weak equivalences, then so is the third.\n2) (Retracts) The three classes of morphisms are closed under retracts (in the\ncategory of morphisms of C).\n3) (Lifting) Define a map to be a trivial cofibration if it is both a cofibration and a\nweak equivalence. Similarly, define a map to be a trivial fibration if it is both a\nfibration and a weak equivalence. Then trivial cofibrations have the left lifting\nproperty with respect to fibrations, and cofibrations have the left lifting property\nwith repect to trivial fibrations.\n4) (Factorization) For any morphism f of C there exist factorizations\nXA\nAA\nAA\n\u03b1 AAA\n\nf\n\nY\u2032\n\n/Y , X\nBB\n}>\nBB\n}\n}\nBB\n}\n}\nBB\n\u03b3\n}} \u03b2\n\nf\n\nX\u2032\n\n/Y\n}>\n}\n}}\n}} \u03b4\n}\n}\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a cofibration, \u03b2 is a trivial fibration, \u03b3 is a trivial cofibration and \u03b4\nis a fibration.\nWe will say that a model category is a category with finite direct and inverse limits\nendowed with a model structure.\nA category has a model structure if and only if it satisfies axioms M2), M5) and\nM6) of [38]. Hence, if a category has a model structure and finite direct and inverse\nlimits, it is what D. Quillen called a closed model category in [38].\nFor the more general notion of derivable category we refer to [6]. In short, a\nderivable category is a category C endowed with three classes of morphisms W , Cof\nand F ib satisfying some familiar axioms which ensure that its homotopy category\nHo C := C[W \u22121 ], i.e. the localization of C with respect to the class W, is still\nunderstandable, that is to say, it is a category whose morphisms can be calculated\nby homotopy relations and calculus of fractions. A relevant derivable category (cf.\nsubsection 5.1. of [6]) is a derivable category satisfying a certain 'lifting property'.\nOne of the good properties of relevant derivable categories is that the morphisms\nin the homotopy categories can be calculated just by using homotopy relations [6,\nProposition 5.11], and so the homotopy categories have small Hom-sets.\nNotice also that if a category has a model structure, an initial object, a final\nobject, pullbacks and pushouts, then it is a relevant derivable category.\n\n\f6\n\nPEDRO NICOL\u00c1S\n\n3. Model structures on Frobenius categories\n3.1. A recognition criterion in Frobenius categories. Recall that if X is a\nclass of morphisms of a category C, then X -inj is the class formed by those morphisms of C having the right lifting property with respect to every morphism in X ,\nX -proj is the class formed by those morphisms of C having the left lifting property\nwith respect to every morphism in X and X -cof= (X -inj)-proj.\nThe proof of [17, Theorem 2.1.19] gives us a kind of 'recognition criterion' to\ndetect model structures. Indeed, consider three classes of morphisms, W , I and\nJ in a category C. Then, there is a model structure on C with I-cof as the class of\ncofibrations, J -cof as the class of trivial cofibrations, and W as the class of weak\nequivalences if\n1) W has the 2-out-of-3 property and is closed under retracts.\n2) Any morphism of C factors as a morphism in I-cof followed by a morphism in\nI-inj.\n3) Any morphism of C factors as a morphism in J -cof followed by a morphism in\nJ -inj.\n4) J -cof \u2286 W \u2229 I-cof.\n5) I-inj \u2286 W \u2229 J -inj.\n6) Either W \u2229 I-cof \u2286 J -cof or W \u2229 J -inj \u2286 I-inj.\nThe following result is a generalization of the techniques of [17, Section 2.3].\nThanks to the recognition criterion, it tells us that if in a Frobenius category we\nfind a class Q of objects (closed under shifts) such that the class I of morphisms\niQ : Q \u2192 IQ with Q in Q, and the class J of morphisms 0 \u2192 IQ with Q in Q,\nsatisfy the conditions 2) and 3) above, then we have a model structure.\nTheorem. Let C be a k-linear Frobenius category and let Q be a class of objects\nof C closed under shifts. Consider the classes I formed by the morphisms iQ :\nQ \u2192 IQ where Q runs through the class Q, J formed by the morphisms 0 \u2192 IQ\nwhere Q runs through the class Q and W of morphisms f such that C(Q, f ) is\nan isomorphism of k-modules for all the objects Q in Q. If I (resp. J ) allows\nfactorizations of any morphism as a map in I-cof (resp. J -cof ) followed by a map\nin I-inj (resp. J -inj), then there is a model structure on C with I-cof as the class\nof cofibrations, J -cof as the class of trivial cofibrations and W as the class of weak\nequivalences. Moreover, with respect to this model structure we have that\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n\nevery object is fibrant,\nevery cofibration is an inflation,\nevery inflation with cokernel in Q is a cofibration,\ntwo morphisms are left homotopic if and only if their difference factors through\nan injective.\n\nProof.

Assume that C is endowed\nwith a model structure (W, F ib, Cof ) such that the class of cofibrations admit cobase\nchanges. If C has pullbacks, then it is a relevant derivable category.\nProof. By using the retract argument and [16, Lemma 7.2.11], one shows easily\nthat a category with a final object and pullbacks endowed with a model structure\nis a left derivable category. Let us see that C is also a right derivable category.\nIndeed, the only axioms which are not trivially satisfied are D2op ) and D3op ), but\n\u221a\nthey hold since cofibrations admit cobase changes.\nCorollary.

If C has kernels, then it is a relevant derivable category. In\nparticular, its homotopy category Ho C := C[W \u22121 ] has small Hom-sets.\nProof. Since C has finite products and kernels, then it has pullbacks. On the other\nhand, inflations admit cobase changes and cofibrations are inflations. Therefore,\n\u221a\nwe can apply the lemma above.\nIn what follows, we present two situations in which a class Q of objects allows\ngood factorizations.\n3.2. Small object argument in Frobenius categories. If Q is a set (resp. a\nclass) such that I (resp. and J ) allows the (generalized) small object argument\n[16] [5], then we easily get a model structure.\nThe following result is a generalization of [17, Theorem 2.3.11].\nCorollary. Let C be a k-linear Frobenius category with small colimits. Let Q be\na set of objects of C closed under shifts. Define I to be the class of morphisms\niQ : Q \u2192 IQ where Q runs through the set Q, J the class of morphisms 0 \u2192 IQ\nwhere Q runs through Q and W the class of morphisms f such that C(Q, f ) is an\nisomorphism for all Q in Q. Assume that the objects of Q are small relative to I-cell\n( cf. [16, Definition 10.4.1.]). Then the classes above define a model structure on C,\nand so, if C has kernels, it is a relevant derivable category. Moreover, its homotopy\ncategory Ho C is the triangle quotient of C by the full triangulated subcategory whose\nobjects are the M such that C(Q, M ) = 0 for all Q in Q, and is triangle equivalent\nto Tria(Q), the smallest full triangulated subcategory of C containing Q and closed\nunder coproducts.\n\n\fTHE BAR DERIVED CATEGORY OF A CURVED DG ALGEBRA\n\n11\n\nProof. The hypotheses 2) and 3) of the recognition criterion are satisfied thanks to\nthe small object argument [16, Proposition 10.5.16, Proposition 10.5.10]. Hence, C\nhas a model structure. To prove the last statement, consider the full triangulated\nsubcategory N of C whose objects are the M such that C(Q, M ) = 0 for all Q in\nQ. Let us show that (Tria(Q), N ) is a t-structure on C. For this, it is enough to\nsee that for each object M , there exists a triangle\nM \u2192 M \u2032 \u2192 M \u2032\u2032 \u2192 SM\n\nin C with M \u2032 \u2208 N and M \u2032\u2032 \u2208 Tria(Q). Now, given M , thanks to the factorization\nassociated to I, we have a relative I-cell complex f : M \u2192 M \u2032 such that M \u2032 \u2192 0\nis in I-inj, i.e. M \u2032 \u2208 N . Since every relative I-cell complex is a cofibration [16,\nf\n\nProposition 10.5.10] and cofibrations are inflations, we have a triangle M \u2192 M \u2032 \u2192\nf\n\nM \u2032\u2032 \u2192 SM coming from a conflation M \u2192 M \u2032 \u2192 M \u2032\u2032 . Since f is a relative I-cell\ncomplex, its cokernel M \u2032\u2032 is an I-cell complex and, by the lemma below, it belongs\nto Tria(Q).\nTherefore, (Tria(Q), N ) is a t-structure and we have a series of equivalences\nTria(Q) \u2243 C/N \u2243 C[W \u22121 ] = Ho C.\n\n\u221a\n\nLemma. Under the hypotheses of the corollary, each I-cell complex belongs to\nTria(Q).\nProof. First step: Let \u03bb be an ordinal. If we have a direct system of conflations\n\u03b5\u03b1 : 0 \u2192 X\u03b1 \u2192 Y\u03b1 \u2192 Z\u03b1 \u2192 0 , \u03b1 < \u03bb ,\nsuch that the structure morphisms Z\u03b1 \u2192 Z\u03b2 are inflations for all \u03b1 < \u03b2 < \u03bb, then\nthe colimit of the system is a conflation. Indeed, it suffices to check that for each\ninjective I, the sequence of abelian groups\n0 \u2192 C(lim Z\u03b1 , I) \u2192 C(lim Y\u03b1 , I) \u2192 C(lim X\u03b1 , I) \u2192 0\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nis exact. This follows from the Mittag-Leffler criterion [13, 0III , 13.1] since the maps\nC(Z\u03b2 , I) \u2192 C(Z\u03b1 , I)\nare surjective for all \u03b1 < \u03b2 < \u03bb.\nSecond step: If we have an acyclic complex of C\n\n. . . \u2192 X p \u2192 X p+1 \u2192 . . . \u2192 X 0 \u2192 Y \u2192 0 ,\n\nthen Y belongs to the smallest triangulated subcategory of C containing the X p and\nstable under countable coproducts. Indeed, by lemma 6.1 of [22], for each complex\nK over C, there is a triangle\naK \u2192 K \u2192 iK \u2192 SaK\nof H(C) such that iK has injective components and aK is the colimit (in the\ncategory of complexes) of a countable sequence of componentwise split monomorphisms of acyclic complexes. The functor iK is the left adjoint of the inclusion\ninto H(C) of the full subcategory of complexes with injective components. Thus, it\ncommutes with coproducts. The composed functor\nF : H(C) \u2192 C , K 7\u2192 Z 0 (aK)\n\n\f12\n\nPEDRO NICOL\u00c1S\n\nis a triangle functor which commutes with coproducts and extends the projection\nC \u2192 C from C to H(C).

Since F commutes with coproducts, it suffices\nto show that the complex X \u2032 is in the smallest triangulated subcategory of H(C)\ncontaining the X p and stable under countable coproducts.

Let X be an I-cell complex. Then there is an ordinal \u03bb\nand a direct system X\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2264 \u03bb, such that we have X = X\u03bb and\n- X0 = 0,\n- for all \u03b1 < \u03bb, the morphism X\u03b1 \u2192 X\u03b1+1 is an inflation with cokernel in Q,\n- for all limit ordinals \u03b2 \u2264 \u03bb, we have X\u03b2 = lim\u03b1<\u03b2 X\u03b1 .\n\u2212\u2192\nWe will show by induction on \u03b2 \u2264 \u03bb that X\u03b2 belongs to Tria(Q). This is clear\nfor X0 . Moreover, if X\u03b1 is in Tria(Q), so is X\u03b1+1 . So let us assume that \u03b2 is a\nlimit ordinal and X\u03b1 belongs to Tria(Q) for each \u03b1 < \u03b2. We wish to show that X\u03b2\nbelongs to Tria(Q). Let C \u03b2 be the category of functors \u03b2 \u2192 C. The evaluation\nC \u03b2 \u2192 C , Y \u2192 Y\u03b1\n\nadmits a left adjoint denoted by Z 7\u2192 Z \u2297 \u03b1.

By splicing exact sequences of the form\na\n0 \u2192Y\u2032 \u2192\nY\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b1 \u2192 Y \u2192 0\n\u03b1<\u03b2\n\nwe construct a complex\n\n. . . \u2192 X p \u2192 X p+1 \u2192 . . . \u2192 X 0 \u2192 X \u2192 0\n\nwhich is ayclic for the pointwise split exact structure on C \u03b2 and such that each\nX p is a coproduct of objects Y \u2297 \u03b1, Y \u2208 Tria(Q), \u03b1 < \u03b2. By the first step, the\ncolimit C of the above complex is still acyclic. Moreover, the components of C are\ncoproducts of objects\nlim(Y \u2297 \u03b1)(\u03b3) = Y\n\u2212\u2192\n\u03b3\n\nbelonging to Tria(Q). Thus, each component of C belongs to Tria(Q). Now, the\n\u221a\nclaim follows from the second step.\n\n\fTHE BAR DERIVED CATEGORY OF A CURVED DG ALGEBRA\n\n13\n\nNotice that if in the corollary above, C has finite inverse (resp. small) limits,\nthen it is a (resp. cofibrantly generated) model category.\nThe fact that the pair (Tria(Q), N ) in the proof of Corollary 3.2 is a t-structure\nin C is a generalization of [1, Proposition 4.5]. With the same techniques, we can\nalso show that if Q is a set of objects closed under non-negative shifts in a klinear Frobenius category C such that the associated set I, formed by the maps\niQ : Q \u2192 IQ where Q runs through Q, is small relative to I-cell, then the smallest\nfull suspended subcategory of C containing Q and closed under arbitrary coproducts\nis an aisle in C. This is a generalization of [2, Proposition 3.2].\nExample. Let A be a unital dg k-algebra. The category of unital dg right Amodules, CA, has a structure of k-linear Frobenius category since it is the category\nof 0-cocycles of a certain exact dg category, cf. [26, 28]. The conflations are those\nshort exact sequences which split in the category of graded A-modules, and an\nobject M of CA is injective-projective if and only if its identity morphism 1M is\nnull-homotopic, i.e. 1M = dM h + hdM for some morphism h of graded A-modules\nhomogeneous of degree \u22121. The corresponding stable category is the category of\nunital dg A-modules up to homotopy, HA. If we take Q to be the set formed by\nall the modules of the form A[n] , n \u2208 Z, then the smallness condition is satisfied\n(cf. [17, Example 2.1.6]) and the model structure leads to the derived category\nHo CA \u223c\n= DA.\nExample. Let A be a unital curved dg k-algebra with curvature c \u2208 A2 (cf. section\n4). Let CA be the category of unital curved dg k-modules (cf. section 7). One could\ndefine the graded k-module\n\u2022\nH \u2022 (M ) := ker d\u2022M /(im d\u2022\u22121\nM \u2229 ker dM )\n\nto be the naive cohomology of a curved dg module M . Notice that A is not a curved\ndg module with its regular structure, but\ne := A/cA\nA\n\nis a curved dg right A-module with the natural multiplication by scalars. If we\ne , n \u2208 Z, then CA\napply Corollary 3.2 to the class Q formed by the objects A[n]\nbecomes a model category whose weak equivalences are those morphisms inducing\nisomorphisms in naive cohomology. Its homotopy category would be a naive derived\ncategory. Ezra Getzler and John D. S. Jones define in [11] a unital curved dg algebra\nto be standard if the curvature is in the center of the algebra. For these standard\nalgebras they define a cohomology in the usual way. It is straightforward to prove\nthat a morphism between standard unital curved dg algebras which induces an\nisomorphism at the level of that cohomology induces a triangle equivalence between\nthe corresponding naive derived categories.\nRemark. If the curvature of a unital curved dg algebra vanishes, then its naive\nderived category is precisely the classical derived category of the underlying dg\nalgebra, and its bar derived category (cf. subsection 8.2) is precisely the relative\nderived category of the underlying dg algebra. This seems to suggest that for an\narbitrary unital curved dg algebra there would exist a fully faithful triangulated\nfunctor from its naive derived category to its bar derived category. However, the\npresence of a non-vanishing curvature makes things considerably less clear.\n\n\f14\n\nPEDRO NICOL\u00c1S\n\n3.3. Factorizations provided by adjunctions.

The objects of this subcategory are precisely the direct summands, in C,\nof the images LN of objects N of D under L.\nProof. We apply Theorem 3.1 to the class Q formed by the objects LN , where N\nbelongs to D.

Let ND be the full subcategory of D formed by the\nobjects N such that D(N, RM ) = 0 for all M in C. We know that NC is an aisle\nin C and that C[WC\u22121 ] is the triangle quotient C/NC . Dually, we have that ND is\n\u22121\na coaisle in D and that D[WD\n] is the triangle quotient D/ND . Notice that NC is\nformed by all the objects M such that RM = 0 in D, and that ND is formed by all\nthe objects N such that LN = 0 in C. Then, we have well defined adjoint triangle\nfunctors\nC/NC\nO\nL\n\nR\n\n\u000f\nD/ND\n\nSince the unit of the adjuntion \u03b7N : N \u2192 RLN becomes an isomorphism in D/ND\nand the counit of the adjuntion \u03b4M : LRM \u2192 M becomes an isomorphism in C/NC ,\nwe have that these functors are mutually quasi-inverse.\n2) Let us show that (L, R) is a Quillen adjunction. To see that L preserves cofibrations, thanks to the retract\ni\u0011applied to the appropriate factorization for\n\u0010hargument\n\u03b7IX \u03b9X\nis a cofibration.

Since f\ni\u0011\n\u0010h\n\u03b7IX\n0\nis a section with projective\nunder L is a cofibration. Now, since L\n0\n1\n\n\f18\n\nPEDRO NICOL\u00c1S\n\ncokernel direct summand of LRLIX, by Lemma 3.3 it is cofibration. Dually, R\npreserves fibrations.\nLet us show that (L, R) is a Quillen equivalence. Let f : LN \u2192 M be a weak\nequivalence, where N is an object of D (and so cofibrant) and M is an object of\nC (and so fibrant). Since R is a right Quillen adjoint functor, it preserves weak\nequivalences between fibrant objects. Therefore, \u03c4N,M (f ) = (Rf )\u03b7N is a weak\nequivalence.\n3) We use Corollary 3.1 to see that C and D are relevant derivable categories.\nNow, since C and D are derivable categories, then the associated prederivators are\nin fact derivators (cf. Corollaire 2.28 of [6]). It is easy to prove that R is left exact\nin the sense of subsection 1.9 of [6]. For instance, since R has a left adjoint, then\nit preserves pullbacks. On the other hand, it is easy to prove that R satisfies the\n\"approximation property\" of subsection 3.6 of [6]. Therefore, by Theorem 3.12 of [6]\nwe know that the corresponding derived functor RR : DC \u2192 DD is an equivalence\n\u221a\nof derivators. Dually, LL : DD \u2192 DC is an equivalence of derivators.\nLemma. a) If a morphism f of D is an inflation, then L(f ) \u2208 I-cof.\nb) If f is an inflation of C with cok(f ) a direct summand of some LRM, then\nf \u2208 I-cof.\nProof. (a) We do the factorization associated to I for L(g). By the retract argument, it suffices to have that L(g) has the left lifting property with respect to the\ncomposition [ 0 1 ]\u03b1. But it is clear that L(g) has the left lifting property with\nrespect to [ 0 1 ] and with respect to \u03b1 (since R(\u03b1) is a retraction with injective\nkernel).\nf\n\n(b) Consider the conflation X \u2192 Y \u2192 cok(f ) with cok(f ) \u2295 Q = LRM .

Let A be a unital dg algebra over k, and let CA be the category of\nunital right dg A-modules. As we will see in subsection 9.2, Theorem 3.3 provides\na model structure on CA whose associated homotopy category Ho CA is the relative\nderived category Drel A (cf. [24]).\nExample.

Hence, from the viewpoint of Homotopy Theory, things\nwork nicely in Frobenius categories because they have model structures according\nto which every object is fibrant and cofibrant.

Thus, the morphisms of Alg[0,2] are instances of the\nmorphisms between cdg algebras of [37]. One can easily construct cdg algebras.\nIndeed, if A is a graded algebra and x is a homogeneous element of degree 1, then\nwe may set m0 (1) = x2 , m1 (a) = xa \u2212 (\u22121)|a| ax for a homogeneous and m2 equal\nto the product on A.\nThe bar construction of an A\u221e -algebra over k yields a cocomplete augmented dg\nk-coalgebra [31]. In the presence of a non-zero curvature, the corresponding coalgebra is still a counital dg k-coalgebra, but the coaugmentation \u03b5 is not compatible\nwith the codifferential d anymore, since one has d\u03b5 6= 0. However, the coalgebra\nobtained is cocomplete augmented as a graded coalgebra. It means that it is an\naugmented graded coalgebra whose associated reduced coalgebra is cocomplete, i.e.\nit is the colimit of the primitive filtration formed by the kernels of the successive comultiplications. This leads to the category of cocomplete graded-augmented counital\ndg k-coalgebras, CgaCdg, whose objects are (C, d, \u2206, \u03b5, \u03b7), such that (C, d, \u2206, \u03b7) is a\ncounital dg coalgebra and (C, \u2206, \u03b5, \u03b7) is a cocomplete augmented graded coalgebra,\nand the morphisms are morphisms of coalgebras compatible with the augmentations, the counits and the codifferentials.\nLet A be an A[0,\u221e[ -algebra over k and let C be a cocomplete graded-augmented\ncounital dg k-coalgebra.

Notice that in general it is not true that\nbi (\u03c4 \u2297i ) = 0 for i \u226b 0 and that for each f in Hom\u2022 k (N, M ) there exists a natural\nnumber i0 \u2265 1 such that \u03bci (f \u2297 \u03c4 (i\u22121) ) = 0 for i \u2265 i0 . However, for each c \u2208 C\nwe do have bi (\u03c4 \u2297 )(c) = 0 for i \u226b 0, and for each f \u2208 Hom\u2022 k (N, M ) and n \u2208 N we\ndo have \u03bci (f \u2297 \u03c4 (i\u22121) )(n) = 0 for i \u226b 0. Therefore, in practice it still makes sense\nto speak of the tangent space in \u03c4 to the Maurer-Cartan equation of the A[0,\u221e[ module S \u22121 Hom\u2022 k (N, M ), denoted by T\u03c4 MC(S \u22121 Hom\u2022 k (N, M )). By using the\ntechniques of Proposition 6.2 we can check that this tangent space identifies with\nthe space of 0-cocycles of the cochain complex F\u03c4 (Hom\u2022 k (N, M )), consisting of the\ngraded module Hom\u2022 k (N, M ) together with the differential given by\nX\nd\u03c4 (f ) :=\n(\u22121)(i\u22121)(|f |+1) \u03bci (f \u2297 \u03c4 \u2297(i\u22121) ).\ni\u22651\n\nTo find the bar construction over C of M , we need to consider the category of\ncounital dg right C-comodules, Com C. It is a Frobenius category since it is the\ncategory of 0-cocycles of a certain exact dg category Comdg C, cf. [26, 28]. The\nconflations are the short exact sequences which split in the category of graded\nC-comodules, and an object N of Com C is injective-projective if and only if its\nidentity morphism 1N is null-homotopic, i.e. 1N = dN h + hdN for some morphism\nh of graded C-comodules homogeneous of degree \u22121. The corresponding stable\ncategory, denoted by HC and called the category of counital C-comodules up to\nhomotopy, is the quotient of Com C by the ideal of the null-homotopic morphisms.\nWe also need the category of counital graded right C-comodules, Grmod C, with\nhomogeneous morphisms of degree 0.\n\n\f28\n\nPEDRO NICOL\u00c1S\n\nNotice that the counital graded right C-comodule, (M \u2297k C, 1M \u2297 \u2206C ), becomes\na counital dg right C-comodule, M \u2297\u03c4 C, with the codifferential induced [31, Lemme\n2.1.2.1] by the map of the Lemma 6.2. Now, the isomorphisms of k-modules\n\u223c\n\n(Grmod C)(N [\u2212p], M \u2297k C) \u2192 Hompk (N, M ) , f 7\u2192 (1M \u2297 \u03b7)f,\ninduce an isomorphism of complexes over k\n\u223c\n\n(Comdg C)(N, M \u2297\u03c4 C) \u2192 F\u03c4 (Hom\u2022 k (N, M )),\nand the isomorphism between the 0-cocycles gives us\n\u223c\n\n(Com C)(N, M \u2297\u03c4 C) \u2192 T\u03c4 MC(S \u22121 Hom\u2022 k (N, M )).\nTherefore, we have\nProposition. Let A be an A[0,\u221e[ -algebra, M an A[0,\u221e[ -module over A, C a cocomplete graded-augmented counital dg coalgebra and \u03c4 a twisting cochain from C\nto A.

By using\nthe Lemma 6.2 one can prove that the structures of A[0,\u221e[ -module over A of a\ngraded k-module M are in bijection with the codifferentials making the counital\ngraded comodule M \u2297k BA into a counital dg comodule. Similarly, the morphisms\nof A[0,\u221e[ -modules from M to N are in bijection with the morphisms of dg BAcomodules from M \u2297\u03c4 BA to N \u2297\u03c4 BA, and the homotopies of A[0,\u221e[ -modules\nfrom f to g are in bijection with the homotopies of dg BA-comodules from the\nmorphism induced by f to the morphism induced by g.\n\n7. Bar/cobar adjunction for cdg modules\nGiven an A[0,n] -algebra, A, the category of A[0,n] -modules over A is the subcategory Nod[0,n] A of Nod[0,\u221e[ formed by the A[0,\u221e[ -modules M with multiplications\nmM\ni = 0 for i > n and morphisms fi = 0 for i > n \u2212 1. For n = 2 we get the\nso-called curved dg(=cdg) modules over a cdg algebra.\nLet us consider a fixed (strictly) unital cdg algebra A and denote by CA the\ncategory of unital cdg A-modules. CA is the category of 0-cocycles of the exact dg\ncategory (cf. [26, 28]) Cdg A whose objects are the unital cdg A-modules and whose\nmorphisms are given by complexes of k-modules Cdg (A)(L, M ) with nth component\nformed by the morphisms of graded k-modules homogeneous of degree n and with\ndifferential given by the commutator d(f ) = dM f \u2212(\u22121)|f |f dL . Thus, as in the case\nof a dg algebra, CA has a structure of a k-linear Frobenius category whose stable\ncategory is the category of unital cdg A-modules up to homotopy, HA, defined\n\n\fTHE BAR DERIVED CATEGORY OF A CURVED DG ALGEBRA\n\n29\n\nprecisely as in the case of unital dg algebras (cf. the first example of subsecction\n3.2).\nGiven a counital dg coalgebra C we still have a cdg algebra Hom\u2022 k (C, A) as\nbefore (cf. section 4). A solution \u03c4 of the Maurer-Cartan equation of this cdg\nalgebra will suffice to 'twist the cochain' since almost all the multiplications of A\nare zero, and so we do not need any extra assumption on \u03c4 .\n7.1. Bar construction for unital cdg modules. For a unital cdg A-module\nM , the counital graded C-comodule (M \u2297k C, 1M \u2297 \u2206C ) becomes a counital dg\nC-comodule, M \u2297\u03c4 C, with the codifferential\ndM\u2297\u03c4 C := dM \u2297 1C + 1M \u2297 dC \u2212 (mM\n2 \u2297 1)(1 \u2297 \u03c4 \u2297 1)(1 \u2297 \u2206).\n\nAs in subsection 6.3, the isomorphism of complexes over k\n\u223c\n\n(Comdg C)(N, M \u2297\u03c4 C) \u2192 F\u03c4 (Hom\u2022 k (N, M ))\ninduces an isomorphism between the 0-cocycles which gives us\n\u223c\n\n(Com C)(N, M \u2297\u03c4 C) \u2192 T\u03c4 MC(S \u22121 Hom\u2022 k (N, M )).\nProposition.

Cobar construction for counital dg comodules. For a counital dg Cmodule N , the unital graded A-module (N \u2297k A, 1M \u2297 mA\n2 ) becomes a unital cdg\nA-module, N \u2297\u03c4 A, with the differential\nA\ndN \u2297\u03c4 A := dN \u2297 1A + 1N \u2297 mA\n1 + (1 \u2297 m2 )(1 \u2297 \u03c4 \u2297 1)(\u2206N \u2297 1).\n\nNow, the isomorphisms of k-modules\n\u223c\n\n(Grmod A)(N \u2297k A, M [p]) \u2192 Hompk (N, M ) , f 7\u2192 f (1N \u2297 \u03b7A )\nwhere Grmod A is the category of graded unital A-modules and \u03b7A is the unit of A,\ninduce an isomorphism of complexes over k\n\u223c\n\n(Cdg A)(N \u2297\u03c4 A, M ) \u2192 F\u03c4 (Hom\u2022 k (N, M ))\nwhich yields an isomorphism between the 0-cocycles\n\u223c\n\n(CA)(N \u2297\u03c4 A, M ) \u2192 T\u03c4 MC(S \u22121 Hom\u2022 k (N, M )).\nProposition.

The adjunction between Frobenius categories. Let A be a unital cdg\nalgebra, and C a counital dg coalgebra. Let us consider the category CA of unital\ncdg right A-modules, which is a Frobenius category as explained at the beginning\nof section 7. Also, let us consider the category Com C of counital dg right Ccomodules, which is a Frobenius category as explained in subsection 6.3.\nCorollary. Let \u03c4 be a solution of the Maurer-Cartan equation in Hom\u2022 k (C, A).\nThen the bar and cobar constructions yield a pair of adjoint exact functors\nCA\nO\nL:=?\u2297\u03c4 A\n\n?\u2297\u03c4 C=:R\n\n\u000f\nCom C\nIn particular, we have isomorphisms\n(HA)(LN, M ) \u223c\n= (HC)(N, RM )\n= H 0 F\u03c4 (Hom\u2022 k (N, M )) \u223c\nnatural in N and M .\n\n8. The bar derived category\nLet A be a unital cdg algebra. When C is the bar construction BA of A, and\nthe twisting cochain is the composition of the projection with the shift to the right,\np1\nw\n\u03c4A : BA \u2192 SA \u2192 A, we will show that the conditions of the Corollary 3.3 are\nsatisfied.\n8.1. The bar resolution of a cdg module. In [31, Lemme 2.2.1.9] it is essentially\nproved that given a unital dg module M over a unital dg algebra A, the adjunction\nmorphism\n\u03b4M : LRM \u2192 M\nis a homotopy equivalence of complexes over k. This morphism is usually called\nthe bar resolution of M . We claim that in the presence of curvature, the morphism\nR(\u03b4M ) is still a homotopy equivalence. Indeed, if sx and sy are homogeneous\nelements of BA, the morphism of graded k-modules\ng : (RLR)(M ) \u2192 (LR)(M ) , m \u2297 sx \u2297 a \u2297 sy 7\u2192 (\u22121)|m|+1 m \u2297 (sx, sa, sy) \u2297 1A\n\ninduces a contracting homotopy for 1 \u2212 \u03b7RM R(\u03b4M ). That is to say, R(\u03b4M ) has\ninjective kernel. We could say that R(\u03b4M ) hides a bar resolution of M . The precise\nstatement is that \u03b4M : LRM \u2192 M is a cofibrant approximation in the model\ncategory CA, endowed with the model structure described in Theorem 3.3.\nNow, from the identity \u03b4LN L(\u03b7N ) = 1LN we get R(\u03b4LN )RL(\u03b7N ) = 1RLN , and\nsince R(\u03b4LN ) is a stable isomorphism, the same holds for RL(\u03b7N ). Therefore, L(\u03b7N )\nis a weak equivalence in CA. But it is a morphism between fibrant-cofibrant objects,\nwhich implies that it is a homotopy equivalence. Since left homotopy agrees with\n\n\fTHE BAR DERIVED CATEGORY OF A CURVED DG ALGEBRA\n\n31\n\nhomotopy in the sense of Frobenius categories (cf. Theorem 3.1), we have that\nL(\u03b7N ) is a stable isomorphism, i.e. has injective cokernel.\nTherefore, subsection 3.3 tells us that CA and Com BA admit certain model\nstructures making the bar/cobar adjunction into a Quillen equivalence. We have\nproved the\nTheorem. Let A be a unital cdg algebra. Consider the bar/cobar adjunction\nCA\nO\nL\n\nR\n\n\u000f\nCom BA\nby using the twisting cochain \u03c4A . Then\n1) There is a model structure in CA such that all the objects are fibrant, an object\nM is cofibrant if and only if it is a direct summand of a module of the form LN\nfor some comodule N , and a morphism f is a weak equivalence if and only if\nRf is a stable isomorphism.\n2) There is a model structure in Com BA such that all the objects are cofibrant, an\nobject N is fibrant if and only if it is a direct summand of a comodule of the\nform RM for some module M , and a morphism f is a weak equivalence if and\nonly if Lf is a stable isomorphism.\n3) The bar/cobar adjunction is a Quillen equivalence for these model structures.\n8.2. The bar derived category. The homotopy category of CA regarded with\nthe model structure of Theorem 8.1 is the bar derived category of A, denoted by\nDbar A. It is the localization of CA with respect to the class of morphisms f such\nthat R(f ) is a stable isomorphism in Com BA, i.e. such that Cone(Rf ) = R Cone(f )\nis injective. Put differently, Dbar A is the localization of CA with respect to the class\nof morphisms f such that Cone(f ) is contractible as an A[0,\u221e[ -module over A.\nMoreover, as we know from Theorem 3.3, the 'acyclic modules' for the bar derived\ncategory, called bar acyclic modules, are those M such that\n(HA)(LN, M ) = 0\nfor every counital dg BA-comodule N . Hence, they are indeed those modules contractible as A[0,\u221e[ -modules over A, but they admit (cf. Corollary 7.3) an alternative\ndescription in terms of true acyclicity of certain complexes forming a class: the bar\nacyclic modules are those M such that\nH 0 F\u03c4 (Hom\u2022 k (N, M )) = 0\nfor every counital dg BA-comodule N . Accordingly, we use the term bar quasiisomorphisms for the weak equivalences of CA, i.e. those morphisms f such that\nCone(f ) is bar acyclic, and the bar closed modules are those M such that\n(HA)(M, M \u2032 ) = 0\nfor every bar acyclic M \u2032 . Theorem 3.3 states that Dbar A is triangle equivalent to\nthe full subcategory Hp,bar A of HA formed by the bar closed modules.\n\n\f32\n\nPEDRO NICOL\u00c1S\n\n9. The various derived categories of a dg algebra\nLet A be a unital dg k-algebra (regarded as a cdg algebra with vanishing curvature). A priori, we have three derived categories associated to it, each of them\nmade from its own notion of acyclicity: the classical, the relative and the bar derived\ncategory. But it turns out that these last two categories agree.\n9.1. The classical derived category. A unital dg A-module M is acyclic if\n(when k is trivially made into a counital dg BA-comodule) we have\n(HA)((Lk)[n], M ) \u223c\n= (HA)(A[n], M ) \u223c\n= H \u2212n M = 0\n\nfor each n \u2208 Z, i.e. if the complex F\u03c4 (Hom\u2022 k (k, M )) \u223c\n= M is acyclic. A morphism\nf is a quasi-isomorphism if its cone is acyclic, and a module M is closed if\n(HA)(M, M \u2032 ) = 0\nfor every acyclic M \u2032 . As we know (cf. Example 3.2), the derived category of A,\ndenoted by DA, is the localization of CA with respect to the quasi-isomorphisms,\nand it is triangle equivalent to the full triangulated subcategory Hp A of HA formed\nby the closed modules.\n9.2. The relative derived category. A unital dg A-module M is relatively acyclic\nif\n(HA)((LK)[n], M ) \u223c\n= (HA)((K \u2297\u03c4 A)[n], M ) \u223c\n= H \u2212n F\u03c4 (Hom\u2022 k (K, M )) = 0\n\nfor each n \u2208 Z and each k-module K (trivially made into a counital dg BAcomodule). But F\u03c4 (Hom\u2022 k (K, M )) is the complex Hom\u2022 k (K, M ) with the differential induced by that of M . Hence, to be relatively acyclic amounts to being contractible as a complex over k. A morphism f is a relative quasi-isomorphism if its\ncone is relatively acyclic, and a module M is relatively closed if\n(HA)(M \u2032 , M ) = 0\n\nfor every relatively acyclic M \u2032 . As we know [24, Proposition 7.4], the relative\nderived category of A, denoted by Drel A, is the localization of CA with respect to\nthe relative quasi-isomorphisms, and it is triangle equivalent to the full triangulated\nsubcategory Hp,rel A of HA formed by the relatively closed modules.\nBut, in fact, the relative derived category of A is its bar derived category. Indeed,\nany bar acyclic dg module is certainly relatively acyclic. On the other hand, let\nM be a (unital) dg A-module which is contractible as a complex over k, and let\nh1 : M \u2192 M be the contracting homotopy of that complex. By using Obstruction\nTheory (cf. [31, Chapitre B]), we can extend h1 to a contracting homotopy for M\nregarded as an A\u221e -module over A, which proves that M is bar acyclic. Then,\nDrel A is the homotopy category of a certain model category, and Theorem 3.3\nproves the analogue of [24, Proposition 7.4] and tells us that Hp,rel A is the smallest\nfull triangulated subcategory of HA containing all the modules of the form N \u2297\u03c4 A,\nfor any counital dg BA-comodule N , and closed under arbitrary coproducts.\n9.3. Links between the derived categories. From the inclusion\n{(Lk)[n]}n\u2208Z \u2286 {LN }n\u2208Z , N \u2208Com BA\nwe have that\n{relatively acyclic} \u2286 {acyclic},\n\n\fTHE BAR DERIVED CATEGORY OF A CURVED DG ALGEBRA\n\n33\n\nand thus Hp A is a full triangulated subcategory of Hp,bar A. Therefore, we have a\nfully faithful triangulated functor\nDA \u2192 Drel A , M 7\u2192 pM\nwhere pM is the closed resolution of M . It is well known that, if k is a field,\nthen the relatively acyclic unital dg A-modules are precisely the acyclic unital dg\nA-modules, and so we have DA = Drel A. Then the following result should be\nviewed as an analogue of Kenji Lef\u00e8vre-Hasegawa's theorem [31, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 2.2.2.2]\nfor unital dg algebras over an arbitrary commutative ring:\nTheorem. Let A be a unital dg k-algebra. Endow the category CA of unital dg Amodules with its structure of model category whose homotopy category is the relative\nderived category Drel A ( cf. subsection 9.2). Then there exists a model structure in\nCom BA such that the bar/cobar constructions\nCA\nO\nL\n\nR\n\n\u000f\nCom BA\nyield a Quillen equivalence.\nOur proof of this theorem, being more conceptual than that of [31], suggests that\nthe classical derived category appears in the statement of Kenji Lef\u00e8vre-Hasegawa's\ntheorem 'incidentally', due to the fact that he is working over a semisimple base.\nIn fact, the category that appears in its own right is the relative derived category.\n\n10. The relative derived category regarded from the A\u221e -theory\nThe spirit of A\u221e -theory (at least over a field) is to replace quasi-isomorphisms\nby homotopy equivalences, up to increasing the amount of morphisms and/or the\namount of objects. Key examples of that are:\n1) The 'Th\u00e9or\u00e8me des A\u221e -quasi-isomorphismes' [31, Corollaire 1.3.1.3], which states\nthat if k is a field, the category of dg k-algebras up to quasi-isomorphisms is\nequivalent to the category of dg k-algebras (with A\u221e -morphisms) up to homotopy equivalences of A\u221e -algebras.\n2) The corresponding result for modules [31, Proposition 2.4.1.1], which states that\nif k is a field and A is an augmented dg k-algebra, then the derived category\nof A is equivalent to the category of unital dg A-modules (with strictly unital\nmorphisms of A\u221e -modules) up to strictly unital homotopy equivalences of A\u221e modules.\nIn the proofs of these results the presence of a base field has been crucial. The aim of\nthis section is to present an analog of the second one for an arbitrary commutative\nring.\n\n\f34\n\nPEDRO NICOL\u00c1S\n\n10.1. Using arbitrary A\u221e -modules.

Thus, we can consider the projective model\nstructure on Nod\u221e A (cf. subsection 3.3) such that its associated homotopy category\nis the stable category Nod\u221e A of Nod\u221e A up to homotopy equivalences of A\u221e modules.

Since A is\naugmented, we have that (\u03b7M )1 : M \u2192 M \u2297\u03c4 BA\u2297\u03c4 A is an inflation in the category\nCk of complexes over k (with the Frobenius structure given by the degreewise split\nshort exact sequences). We can see that its cokernel is contractible in Ck with the\ncontracting homotopy induced by the map\n(\n(\u22121)|m|+|sx|m \u2297 (sx, sa) \u2297 1A if a 6= 1A ,\nH(m \u2297 sx \u2297 a) =\n0\nif a = 1A .\nwhere sx is a homogeneous element of BA. Therefore (see e.g. [6, Lemme 4.18])\n(\u03b7M )1 is a homotopy equivalence of complexes over k, that is to say, its cone\nCone((\u03b7M )1 ) is a contractible complex. But this is the underlying complex of the\ncone Cone \u03b7M of \u03b7M , and by Obstruction Theory we conclude that Cone \u03b7M is \u221aa\ncontractible A\u221e -module. In other words, \u03b7M is a weak equivalence in Nod\u221e A.\nNotice that the passage from CA to Nod\u221e A increases both the number of objects\nand of morphisms. However, it is not necessary to increase the number of objects,\nas shown in the following result:\n\n\fTHE BAR DERIVED CATEGORY OF A CURVED DG ALGEBRA\n\n35\n\nCorollary. Drel A is triangle equivalent to the category of unital dg A-modules (with\nmorphisms of A\u221e -modules) up to homotopy equivalences of A\u221e -modules.\nProof. Let C be the full subcategory of Nod\u221e A formed by the unital dg A-modules.\nIt is an exact subcategory of Nod\u221e A which inherits a structure of Frobenius category. Then, the inclusion C \u0592\u2192 Nod\u221e A induces a fully faithful functor C \u0592\u2192\nNod\u221e A which is essentially surjective. Indeed, given an A\u221e -module M over A, we\nknow from the proof of the theorem above that the unit of the adjunction (LR\u221e , V ),\n\u03b7M : M \u2192 M \u2297\u03c4 BA \u2297\u03c4 A,\n\nis a homotopy equivalence of A\u221e -modules, and so M \u223c\n= M \u2297\u03c4 BA \u2297\u03c4 A in Nod\u221e A.\nTherefore,\nDrel A \u2243 Nod\u221e A \u2243 C.\n\n\u221a\n\n10.2. Using strictly unital A\u221e -modules. Let A be an augmented dg k-algebra.\nIf we want strictly unital morphisms and homotopies of A\u221e -modules to appear in\nthe description of Drel A from the viewpoint of A\u221e -theory, then we have to use a\ndifferent coalgebra. Namely, if A is the reduction of A, then we have to consider the\nbar construction BA of A instead of the bar construction BA of A. The coalgebra\nBA is a counital dg coalgebra and the composition\np1\n\nw\n\n\u03c4 : BA \u2192 SA \u2192 A \u0592\u2192 A\nis a solution of the Maurer-Cartan equation of the dg algebra Hom\u2022 k (BA, A).\nHence, we have an adjunction\nCA\nO\nL\n\nR\n\n\u000f\nCom BA\nWe can complete the picture with the functor U : CA \u2192 Mod\u221e A which takes a\nunital dg A-module M to M itself regarded as a strictly unital A\u221e -module over A,\n\u223c\nthe equivalence ? : Mod\u221e A \u2192 Nod\u221e A which takes a strictly unital A\u221e -module\nM over A to the A\u221e -module M over A with restricted multiplications, and the bar\nconstruction R\u221e : Nod\u221e A \u2192 Com BA. Then we have\nU (not full)\n\nCA\nO\nL\n\nR\n\n\u000f\nCom BA\n\n/ Mod\u221e A ? / Nod A\n\u221e\nggg\ng\u223c\nggggg\ng\ng\ng\ng\ngg\ngggggR\u221e (fully faithful)\ns gggg\ng\n\nIf \u03b4M : LRM \u2192 M is the counit of the adjunction (L, R), we can prove that R(\u03b4M )\nis a homotopy equivalence of comodules by using almost the same contracting\nhomotopy as the one used in subsection 8.1 (from which one can easily deduce\nthe contracting homotopy -in the category of complexes over k- of [31, Lemme\n2.2.1.9]). Therefore, Theorem 3.3 tells us that there exist certain model structures\non CA and Com BA making (L, R) into a Quillen equivalence. It is easy to check\nthat the homotopy category Ho CA is again the relative derive category Drel A.
