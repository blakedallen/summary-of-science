At a distance of 145+39\n\u221225 pc (Bertout, Robichon,\n& Arenou 1999), it might be an outlying member of the Upper Scorpio subgroup of the Sco-Cen\nassociation (Andersen et al. 1989).\nAK Sco is estimated to be 6 \u00d7 106 yr old (Andersen et al. 1989) and has strong Li absorption\nlines (Herbig & Rao 1972). However, its classification is unclear. The NIR excess and large irregular\nlight variations are more typical of a classical T Tauri star (CTTS), but the weak emission lines\nmake it a weak-line T Tauri star (WTTS) (Andersen et al. 1989). The spectral type is F5 V\n(Herbig & Rao 1972, Hamann & Persson 1992) which puts it in a group intermediate between\nT Tauris stars and F-type stars according to Th\u00e9, de Winter, & P\u00e9rez (1994).\nAK Sco has been known for decades to be highly variable at optical and IR wavelengths.\nPeriods of roughly constant optical brightness at an average level are interrupted at irregular\nintervals by rapid variations (Bibo & Th\u00e9 1991), with no correlation (at least permanent) with\norbital period (see Jensen & Mathieu 1997). The large photometric variations are attributed to\nvariable obscuration by circumstellar (CS) dust condensations (Andersen et al. 1989, Hutchinson\net al. 1994).\nThe submm continuum emission must arise outside the binary orbit, in a circumbinary (CB)\ndisk (Jensen & Mathieu 1997) with a predicted dynamically-cleared gap between 0.032 and 0.48 AU.\nThis gap can reproduce the observations if it is filled with optically thin material to reproduce a\nstrong 10 \u03bcm silicate feature. However, since there is no evidence for a NIR deficit of emission, this\ngap is not absolutely necessary (Jensen & Mathieu 1997).\nNumerical simulations of the evolution of circumbinary disks by G\u00fcnther & Kley (2002) show\nthat in the dynamically-cleared gap in the CB disk, spiral arms bring CS matter from the CB disk\nto the CS disks around each star, in agreement with Jensen & Mathieu's (1997) interpretation of\nthe SED with a gap filled with optically thin material. Accretion is predicted to be synchronized\nwith apastron, but AK Sco does not exhibit clear periodic excesses of luminosity at those phases.\nA model matching spectroscopic and photometric observations includes two identical stars\n(M = 1.5M\u2299 , R = 2.2R\u2299 , L = 0.9L\u2299 ) with an orbital inclination of \u223c63\u25e6 , embedded in a dense\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ncloud with fine structure near the stars and grains larger than those of standard interstellar clouds.\nNo uncertainty is given for the orbital inclination, but eclipses, which have not been observed so\nfar, would be expected if i & 70\u25e6 . The cloud has a dimension similar to the size of the orbit and\nwas determined to be the cause of the irregular variations. A cooler dust component also exists at\na larger distance at \u2248 10 AU (Andersen et al. 1989).\nAK Sco's SED was also fit by Gregorio-Hetem & Hetem (2002) to give stellar radii of 1.69R\u2299 ,\na disk radius of 10 AU and an envelope radius of 1600 AU. The optical depth was \u03c4 = 0.38 and the\ninclination 61\u25e6 . The authors also classify AK Sco as a young main sequence star.\nAlencar et al. (2003) have also used photometric and spectroscopic observations to find the\nphysical parameters for the two near-identical stars: M = 1.35 \u00b1 0.07M\u2299 , R = 1.59 \u00b1 0.35R\u2299 ,\nwith an orbital inclination 65\u25e6 < i < 70\u25e6 . The dust obscuration was also computed and reveals the\nexistence of substructure at a scale of a stellar diameter. One side of the orbit would also be more\nobscured than the other.\nPolarimetry of binaries, spectroscopic or visual, can be very useful to learn about the geometry\nof their systems (see the recent review by Manset 2004, in preparation). In a recent series of\npapers (Manset & Bastien 2000, 2001; hereafter Papers I and II), we have studied numerically the\npolarization variations produced by electrons and dusty envelopes surrounding binary stars, and\nwe have also developed tools to compare observations of pre-main sequence (PMS) binaries with\nanalytical and numerical models and applied them to about two dozens PMS binaries (Manset &\nBastien 2001b, 2002, 2003; hereafter Papers III, IV, and V).\nIn this paper, we present simultaneous polarimetric and photometric observations of AK Sco\n(Sec. 2), use the tools developed earlier to analyze these data (Sec. 3), and compare with the\nphotometric data (Sec. 4). Finally, we compare our results with those of other PMS binaries (Sec.\n5) and with numerical simulations (Sec. 6).\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe photometric and polarimetric observations were carried out between 1982 February 12\u221224\nwith the European Southern Observatory (ESO) photometer and polarimeter mounted respectively\non the 50-cm and 1.0-m telescopes at La Silla, Chile. Standard U BV bandpasses were used for the\nphotometric observations. The polarimetric bandpasses approximate the usual U BV bands, and\nare defined by the following central wavelengths and bandwidths: 3550 (700), 4300 (1000), and\n5250 (500) \u00c5. For the polarimetry, a 14\u2032\u2032 aperture hole was used. Data were reduced using the ESO\ndata reduction programs.\nPrimary photometric standard stars and two comparison stars within 1\u25e6 from AK Sco, HR 8331\n(SAO 208130, K0) and HR 8351 (SAO 208088, G5), were observed on every night during the\nobserving period, except on 1982 February 14-15 (UT). Table 1 gives the average values, standard\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ndeviations, and the number of observations for the two comparison stars. These standard deviations\nare somewhat larger than expected for a good photometric site such as La Silla, because the stars\n(comparison stars and AK Sco) have purposely been observed starting at large air masses in order to\nincrease the time coverage as much as possible. This has no significant effect on the results because\nthe observed variations are much larger than the errors. The standard deviations are larger in the V\nband (and also B and U, although not given) than in the colors because the atmospheric fluctuations\nare larger in the total extinction (e.g., kV for V ) than they are in the colors (a differential effect,\ne.g., kB\u2212V for B \u2212 V ). Nevertheless, the two comparison stars clearly show a stable non-variable\nbehavior, which demonstrates the photometric variability of AK Sco. The photometric data are\nlisted in Table 2.\nStandard polarized and unpolarized stars have been observed throughout the observing run.\nThe instrumental polarization was found to be < 0.05% and was therefore neglected. The polarization data are given in Tables 3 to 5.\nLarge amplitude variations in both photometric and polarimetric data are readily noticed.\nThese amplitudes are typically 0.5 mag in V , 0.12 mag in B \u2212 V , and 0.20 mag in U \u2212 B, and\n0.9%, 47\u25e6 at 3550\u00c5, 1.0%, 30\u25e6 at 4300\u00c5, and 0.8%, 22\u25e6 at 5250\u00c5. The most striking feature is that\nusually when the star is bright, the polarization is small and when the polarization is large, the\nstar is fainter and also redder.\nIn the next section, we first estimate the contribution of interstellar polarization to the observed\npolarization, then discuss the variability and periodicity of the polarization.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nPolarimetry\n\nEstimate of the interstellar and intrinsic polarization\n\nThe Heiles (2000) polarization catalog, which contains polarimetric observations for more than\n9000 stars, was used to estimate the interstellar (IS) polarization in the vicinity of AK Sco by\nselecting 23 stars located within 80 pc and 15\u25e6 of it. The map of IS polarization is presented in\nFigure 1. The IS distance-weighted polarization calculated by averaging the polarization of the\n23 stars is 0.70% \u00b1 0.16% in the V band. The IS grains alignment is relatively good because the\nnon-weighted average position angle is 19 \u00b1 9\u25e6 , whereas the distance-weighted value is 165 \u00b1 5\u25e6 .\nSee Paper V for more details about our averaging procedure.\nAK Sco's average polarization (N =27) is 0.70% at 132\u25e6 at 3550\u00c5, 0.84% at 132\u25e6 at 4300\u00c5, and\n1.0% at 133\u25e6 at 5250\u00c5 (see Tables 3 to 5 for the detailed observations). These levels of polarization\nare comparable to the IS polarization and indicate the presence of IS polarization in AK Sco's\nmeasurements. However, the weighted and non-weighted IS position angles are different than\nAK Sco's position angle values, and indicate the presence of intrinsic polarization. We therefore\nconclude that AK Sco's observed polarization is a sum of IS and intrinsic polarization. Bastien\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n(1985) had also found that AK Sco's polarization is in part intrinsic and in part interstellar.\nUsing our estimate of the IS polarization, 0.70% at 165\u25e6 in the V band, and Serkowski's\nlaw for IS polarization (Serkowski, Mathewson, & Ford 1975), we have found the IS polarization\nvalue for the 3 observed wavelengths. We have assumed that \u03bbmax = 5500 \u00c5 for Serkowski's law\n(a typical value) and that the position angle of the IS polarization is constant as a function of\nwavelength. After subtracting this estimated IS polarization from the observed one, we get the\nestimated intrinsic polarization for AK Sco: 0.70% at 108\u25e6 at 3550\u00c5, 0.83% at 109\u25e6 at 4300\u00c5,\nand 0.94% at 112\u25e6 at 5250\u00c5. AK Sco's intrinsic polarization is high. Data taken for other PMS\nbinaries (but at a redder wavelength, 7660\u00c5, see Papers III \u2212 V) indicate that AK Sco has one of\nthe highest intrinsic polarization.\nThe significant intrinsic polarization indicates that the circumstellar or circumbinary material\naround this binary has an asymmetric configuration, for example, a disk rather than a spherical\nshell.\nTwo other facts point to an intrinsic polarization component in the observed polarization for\nAK Sco. First, AK Sco shows clear periodic variations (see below) that cannot be of IS origin.\nSecond, the position angle of the polarization varies as a function of wavelength (see below). Observations of polarized standard stars (whose polarization is of IS origin) by Schmidt, Elston, &\nLupie (1992) show that the maximum observed rotation of the position angle between 4350 and\n8580\u00c5 is \u2248 0.25\u25e6 , much less than the \u223c 10\u25e6 rotation seen for AK Sco.\nAs discussed by Dolan & Tapia (Dolan & Tapia 1986 and references cited), a wavelengthdependent position angle could in theory be attributed to multiple IS clouds containing different\ngrain sizes magnetically aligned in different directions, or to an IS cloud where there is a continuous\nrotation of the grains' orientation, but, once again, the variability argument points to the presence\nof intrinsic polarization.\n\n3.2.\n\nVariability analysis and comparison with previous data\n\nAlready from the data presented in the tables and figures, it is obvious that AK Sco's polarization is variable, as had been found by Serkowski (1969), Bastien (1985), and Drissen et al.\n(1989). Nonetheless, we applied various tests to check the polarimetric variability or stability of\nAK Sco: minimum and maximum values, variance test, Z test, and finally, a \u03c72 test. It should be\nnoted that these tests usually assume that the parent distribution of the quantity measured (here,\nP , \u03b8, or the Stokes parameters Q and U ) is Normal. Since P and \u03b8 are not distributed Normally\n(Serkowski 1958), these tests should in general be applied only to the Stokes parameters Q and U .\nWe have calculated the variance of the sample \u03c3sample and compared it to the standard deviation\nof the mean \u03c3mean . For a set of observations of a non-variable quantity, the sample variance will\nbe small and similar to the standard deviation of the mean. But if there is variability, the \"width\"\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nof the observations, or variance, will be greater than the standard deviation of the mean.\nFor the Z test, if the data are \"well behaved\", or \"consistent\", Z \u2248 1 within its standard error.\nIf Z differs significantly from 1, then there may be variability. Lastly, \u03c72 values are calculated for Q\nand U separately, using 1\u03c3i and 1.5\u03c3i . The probability to obtain a given value of \u03c72 in a Gaussian\ndistribution is found for each of the four \u03c72 values. The star is variable if at least 2 of the four \u03c72\nvalues are over 0.95; the star is suspected to be variable if one out of four \u03c72 values is over 0.95.\nDetails and formulas for these tests were presented in a previous paper (Paper IV). Results of\nthe tests are presented in Table 6 and clearly indicate that AK Sco's polarization was variable for\nall 3 filters, over a 12-day period in February 1982. Variations are observed from night to night\nand also within the same night, and this variability is more pronounced at 4300\u00c5.\nAK Sco presents one atypical observation, taken on February 13 in the U filter, where the\nposition angle measured departs markedly from the other values (see Table 3 and Figure 2). Atypical\nobservations such as this one were also found in many of the PMS binaries studied previously\n(Papers III, IV, and V) and are not related to the orbital motion but probably to eruptive-like\nevents. Since the data for AK Sco was obtained with an instrument different than the one used for\nPapers III\u2212V, this confirms that it is not an instrumental effect.\nSince the position angle varies, it implies that if the polarization is due to a cloud in orbit\naround the stars, the line of sight is not in the orbital plane, in agreement with the orbital inclination\nfound by others.\nSerkowski (1969) observed AK Sco with U , B, and V filters and a 25\u2032\u2032 aperture hole over a\n454 day period. Although the uncertainties are rather high (mean error 0.11% in the V and B\nfilters, higher in the U filter), the data indicate variability on time scales of days in all three filters.\nThe polarization changes from 0.3 to 0.8%, and the position angle, from 60\u25e6 to 145\u25e6 . Interestingly,\nthe polarization variations sometimes go in opposite directions in the V and B filters; when the\npolarization in the V filter increases, the polarization in the B filter decreases. The variations in\nposition angle usually, but not always, increase or decrease at the same time in both filters. There\nare no long-term trends (the mean polarization does not change much from month to month or\nover a few months). The mean position angle is the same in the B and V filters.\nBastien (1985) has observed AK Sco in various filters. As with the Serkowski (1969) data,\nthese observations show variability on time scales of a day, with variations in all filters, and up to\n1% and up to 45\u25e6 . The amplitude of the polarimetric variations is greater in the U band than in the\nvisual bands. On one occasion, the polarization decreased in the U and V filters while increasing in\nthe B filter. The average polarization in all wavelengths was significantly higher during Bastien's\nobservations (in 1981) that during Serkowski's (from 1967 to 1969).\nDrissen et al. (1989) have observed AK Sco at 7500\u00c5 in 1986. The data indicate once again\nvariability on a nightly basis. The average polarization seems to be at the same level as that of\n1981.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nHutchinson et al. (1994) observed AK Sco in B and Ic in 1986. The level of polarization\nand the position angle are similar to the 1980's data. They noted that the flux in the infrared N\nband rises as the visual flux declines, which means the V band variations seen during their run are\nunlikely to be caused by the binarity. They also concluded that the occultation model is consistent\nwith the data in some cases but does not always work with the simultaneous observations in the\noptical and IR.\nAll these data indicate that polarimetric variability is mostly present on time scales of hours\nand days, and decades (when comparing Serkowski's data to all the other sets of data). Variations\nare observed at all wavelengths. The variations for different filters usually go in the same direction;\n2 different sets of data have shown variations in opposite direction for the V and B filters. The\namplitude of the variations is higher in the blue than in the yellow. No variation that could mimic\nthe behavior of the polarization during an eclipse was observed.\n\n3.3.\n\nPeriodic polarimetric variations\n\nFigures 2 to 4 present the polarimetric observations P and \u03b8, and the Stokes parameters\nQ = P cos(2\u03b8) and U = P sin(2\u03b8) as a function of the orbital phase, calculated with the ephemeris\n49000.0 + 13.6093E, with the period from Mathieu (1994) and an arbitrary starting point. Alencar\net al. (2003) have found a periastron time of passage of 46654.3634\u00b10.0086, which puts the periastron at around phase 0.64 in our data. Observations are represented as first and second harmonics\nof \u03bb = 2\u03c0\u03c6, where \u03c6 is the orbital phase, 0 < \u03c6 < 1 and the solid lines are fits made to the following\nequations:\nQ = q0 + q1 cos \u03bb + q2 sin \u03bb + q3 cos 2\u03bb + q4 sin 2\u03bb,\n\n(1)\n\nU\n\n(2)\n\n= u0 + u1 cos \u03bb + u2 sin \u03bb + u3 cos 2\u03bb + u4 sin 2\u03bb.\n\nThe coefficients of this fit are then used to find the orbital inclination according to the BME formalism (Brown, McLean & Emslie 1978):\n\u0014\n\n1 \u2212 cos i\n1 + cos i\n\n\u00152\n\n=\n\n(u1 + q2 )2 + (u2 \u2212 q1 )2\n,\n(u2 + q1 )2 + (u1 \u2212 q2 )2\n\n(3)\n\n\u0014\n\n1 \u2212 cos i\n1 + cos i\n\n\u00154\n\n=\n\n(u3 + q4 )2 + (u4 \u2212 q3 )2\n.\n(u4 + q3 )2 + (u3 \u2212 q4 )2\n\n(4)\n\nThe polarization P varies by 0.9% in U , 1.0% in B, and 0.8% in V . The position angle \u03b8\nvariations decrease from 47\u25e6 in U , to 30\u25e6 in B, and to 22\u25e6 in V . Variations are then more apparent\nin the blue (3550\u00c5 \u2212 4300\u00c5) than in the yellow (5250\u00c5) part of the spectrum.\nData taken during 12 consecutive nights show clear and regular variations, with some scatter\nbut less than for many of the other binaries that were observed over longer periods of time (Pa-\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\npers IV and V). This might be an indication that observations gathered over a small interval of\ntime will show less scatter and clearer periodic variations. Data taken by Serkowski (1969) over 450\ndays, or even by Drissen et al. (1989) over 40 days do not show the regular variations presented\nhere.\nThere is a strong peak (or dip) seen in P and U between phases 0.4 and 0.5, just before\nperiastron, seen in all 3 filters. This peak is not clearly present in the Serkowski data, but might be\npresent in the Drissen et al. (1989) data, only defined by one observation. The Bastien (1985) data\ndo not cover the appropriate orbital phases. In addition to these single-periodic variations (seen\nonce per orbit), the fit indicates the presence of a smaller secondary peak. Numerical simulations\nhave shown that for circular orbits, only double-periodic variations are seen; as the eccentricity\nincreases, single-periodic variations become predominant (see Papers I and II). The presence of\nthe single-periodic variations is qualitatively compatible with the high eccentricity, e = 0.47. The\nratio of the amplitude in 1\u03bb over the amplitude in 2\u03bb is 7.34 for Q, 1.14 for U , 1.09 for P , and\n4.15 for \u03b8, at 5250\u00c5. However, the single-periodic variations for Q and \u03b8 clearly dominate over the\ndouble-periodic ones, and this is not seen in our simulations for e = 0.5 and a CB disk unless the\ninclination is much lower (i \u2248 20\u25e6 ). AK Sco and NTTS 162814-2427 (Paper V) are the only two\nexamples so far of very strong single-periodic variations. Theses two binaries also have a very high\neccentricity (0.47 and 0.48 respectively).\nOther explanations exist for the predominance of the single-periodic variations: stars of different masses and luminosities, an asymmetric configuration (with respect to the orbital plane) of the\nCB disk, or the presence of a CS disk. We know that the luminosity ratio of the two components\nis 4 (Andersen et al. 1989) but this is not enough to explain the morphology of the variations. CS\ndisks (although small) are possible, along with a CB disk.\nThe strong amplitude of the P variations, of over 0.5%, is compatible with the fact that\na cleared central region is not necessarily indicated by the spectral energy distribution; we have\nshown in Paper I that when scatterers are located close to the stars, they produce more pronounced\nvariations.\n\n3.4.\n\nPolarization as a function of wavelength\n\nPolarization is almost always lower in the blue and higher in the yellow part of the spectrum.\nThe position angle also varies as a function of the wavelength, with different dependencies on the\nwavelength. Bastien (1985) noted the highly variable wavelength dependence. Hutchinson et al.\n(1994) also present a P (\u03bb) curve.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n4.\n\nSimultaneous photometry and polarimetry\n\nThe photometric data are presented in Table 2 and Figure 5. Variations are clearly present,\nand follow the same time-dependence for the 3 wavelengths. As can be seen in Figure 6, AK Sco\nis bluer when bright, and redder when faint, with no color reversal (when a further decrease in\nbrightness is followed by bluer colors again), a behavior that had already been found by Bibo &\nTh\u00e9 (1991) using over 100 observations spread over more than 3 years, and by Hutchinson et al.\n(1994). A coarse study of the photometric data presented by Bibo & Th\u00e9 (1991), especially in their\nfigure 29, shows that the photometric behavior of AK Sco is not clearly periodic but shows rapid\nvariations.\nHutchinson et al. (1994) also noted that the 10\u03bcm flux increases when the star gets fainter, an\nobservation that is attributed to a major change in the outer dust distribution (\u223c 1 AU), indicating\nthat a simple occultation model is inadequate.\nThe color-magnitude diagram B \u2212 V , V exhibits a ratio of total to selective absorption of\nR = 4.3, higher than in normal interstellar clouds where R = 3.1. This had already been noted\nby Andersen et al. (1989) and would be characteristic of circumstellar (as opposed to IS) matter\n(Strom et al. 1972).\nThere is also a correlation between the photometry and the polarimetry: the polarization is\nlow when the star is blue, and higher when the star is redder (see Figure 7). Photometry and\npolarimetry in the B band is presented in Figure 8. The behavior is that when the star gets fainter,\nit also gets redder and its polarization increases.\nThere is no evidence in our data for eclipses of one component of the binary by the other, as\nwas suspected by Andersen et al. (1989). An inclination higher than 63\u25e6 would however make an\nexplanation of the correlated photometric and polarimetric variations easier.\nThe simultaneous photometric and polarimetric observations increase the diagnostic value of\nthe data. The interpretation is that a cloud of circumstellar matter passes in front of the star,\ndecreasing the amount of direct, unpolarized light, and increasing the contribution of scattered\nand polarized light. This explains the decrease in brightness, the reddening, and the increase in\npolarization.\n\n5.\n\nOrbital inclination and other parameters\n\nAs shown in previous papers, the results of the BME formalism will only give reasonable results\nif the stochastic noise present in the data does not exceed some limit. Since AK Sco's data was\ntaken over a short period of time (within one orbit), the data suffer from less noise than for our\nother binaries (see Papers IV and V). Even with data with less scatter, the noise (square root of the\nvariance of the fit over the amplitude of the variations; the amplitude comes from the maximum\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nvalues of the data and not of the fit) is still above the 10% limit.\nTherefore, we cannot confirm or infirm the 63\u25e6 inclination found by Andersen et al. (1989).\nEven though the results of the BME formalism might not be significant, at least for the\norbital inclination, they are presented in Table 7 for the 3 wavelengths, where O1 and O2 refer\nto the coefficients of single- and double-periodic variations. The inclination found increases with\nwavelength, but this might not be significant considering the uncertainties on the results.\nAK Sco has relatively high values of \u03c40 G and \u03c40 H (1-2 \u00d710\u22123 ), a factor of \u223c 10 higher than the\nvalues for other binaries (of all types), and the highest values for our sample of PMS binaries. The\nratios \u03c40 G/\u03c40 H = 1.4\u22121.6 are typical values. It is interesting to note that AK Sco has clear evidence\nfor a CB disk whose central region is not necessarily totally empty. GW Ori, NTTS 162814-2427\nand NTTS 162819-2423S, which also have massive CB disks but with central holes, have \u03c40 G and\n\u03c40 H values typical of the other PMS binaries. The values of \u03c40 G, \u03c40 H, and the ratio are similar\nfor the B and V bands, but are different in the U band.\n\n6.\n\nComparison with numerical simulations\n\nSince the orbital inclination and eccentricity are known, we tried to reproduce the observed\npolarimetric variations with various geometries. Even with these two parameters set, it is difficult\nto reproduce the data, in particular the large observed polarization amplitude.\nFigure 9 presents the results of a simulation with a CB disk surrounding the binary, which is\nat the center of an evacuated cavity (see Figure 1 in Paper II for a sketch of that geometry). The\ndisk's radius is set to 1.0 and has a flatness of 25% (the third axis equals 0.25 the disk radius);\nthe central spherical cavity has a radius of 0.20; the orbital parameters are i = 63\u25e6 , e = 0.47,\nand orbital radius 0.1; astronomical silicate grains of radii 0.1\u03bcm were used, with an optical depth\n\u03c4 = 0.1 in the equatorial plane (\u03c4 = 0.037 in the line of sight). The stars have equal masses (and\nluminosities). Variations are double-periodic but do not have the strong single-periodic variations\nseen in the observations, and the amplitude is smaller (0.02% compared to the observed 0.8%).\nIf the inclination is not as low as i = 63\u25e6 (Andersen et al. 1989), our simulations still can not\nreproduce the amplitude or morphology of the observed variations.\nSince we had found earlier that CS disk geometries are more favorable to high amplitude\nvariations, we did a simulation with only a CS disk around the primary (see Figure 5 in Paper II\nfor a sketch of the geometry). Figure 10 presents the polarimetric variations resulting from such\na geometry. The CS disk has axes of radii 0.2, 0.2, and 0.1, and a spherical cavity of radius 0.05.\nThe same grains and orbital characteristics were used, except that the orbital radius was set to\n0.5. The optical depth in the line of sight is now 0.07. The primary illuminating its disk from\nthe inside only introduces noise in the polarization with amplitude 0.02%. The figure shows only\nthe polarization caused by the secondary illuminating the disk externally. The variations show two\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nstrong peaks close to each other that do not really reproduce the observations; the amplitude is\nalso too small (0.1%) although the variations produced are more important than for the CB disk\ncase. The polarization is highest around phase zero, when the primary and its disk are closest to\nthe observer and the secondary is behind.\nSince it is known that electrons usually produce more polarization and higher amplitude variations, we tried the CS disk geometry with electrons. There were no change in the shape of the\nvariations nor their amplitude. If the optical depth is increased from 0.1 to 0.3, the amplitude of\nthe variations goes from 0.09% to almost 0.12%. If the periastron angle is changed from 0\u25e6 to 90\u25e6 ,\nvariations go from 0.09% to 0.17%.\nThe maximum amplitude that we can get with our single scattering code, with electrons to\nmaximize \u2206P , but still retaining axial symmetry for the distribution of scatterers around the\nprimary (the only asymmetry is that of the binary) is \u2248 0.2%. There are two other options that\nwould probably increase the amplitude of the polarization variations, a larger optical depth, and\nalso having a non-axisymmetric density distribution around one (or both) stars. For example, a\nstream of material falling onto the star along a magnetic flux tube as in some recent observations\nfor AA Tau (Bouvier et al. 2003) or in the high-resolution numerical simulations of G\u00fcnther &\nKley (2002), would have scatterers close to the star, where the polarization per scatterer is larger.\nWe leave these two possibilities to future modelling efforts.\n\n7.\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe have presented simultaneous photometric and polarimetric observations of a PMS spectroscopic binary, AK Sco. The mean observed polarization (N =27) is 0.70% at 132\u25e6 at 3550\u00c5,\n0.84% at 132\u25e6 at 4300\u00c5, and 1.0% at 133\u25e6 at 5250\u00c5. If an estimate of the interstellar polarization\nis removed, the intrinsic polarization for AK Sco is still significant, 0.70% at 108\u25e6 at 3550\u00c5, 0.83%\nat 109\u25e6 at 4300\u00c5, and 0.94% at 112\u25e6 at 5250\u00c5. This indicates the presence of circumstellar matter\ndistributed in an asymmetric geometry (like a flattened envelope or disk).\nAK Sco's polarization cannot be of interstellar origin only because (1) the position angles for\nthe interstellar and observed polarizations are different, (2) AK Sco's polarization P is variable,\n(3) its position angle also varies, as a function of time and wavelength.\nThe polarization is clearly variable at all wavelengths, on time scales of hours, days, months,\nand years, which is a typical behavior for PMS stars. The data were obtained on 12 consecutive\nnights, almost covering the 13.6 day period. Regular variations are seen and have amplitudes of\n\u2206P \u2248 1.0%, \u2206\u03b8 \u2248 30\u25e6 , the highest seen so far for PMS binaries. Those variations are more apparent\nin the blue (3550\u22124300\u00c5) than in the yellow part of the spectrum (5250\u00c5) and are compatible with\nthe presence of circumstellar matter located close to the stars.\nThe variations are not simply double-periodic (as produced by a simple model of 2 equal mass\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nstars in a circular orbit, at the center of an axisymmetric circumbinary envelope made of electrons),\nbut include single-periodic variations. The presence of single-periodic variations could be due to\nnon equal mass stars, the presence of dust grains, an asymmetric configuration of the circumstellar\nor circumbinary material, or the eccentricity of the orbit (e = 0.469).\nThe polarimetric data show some scatter but less than for many of the other PMS binaries\nthat were observed over longer periods of time (Papers IV and V). We believe this indicates that\nobservations of binaries gathered over a small interval of time compared to the time scale characteristic of modifications in the CS environment will suffer less from epoch-to-epoch variations in\nthe average polarization, and therefore show less scatter and clearer periodic variations.\nThe polarization varies as a function of wavelength, and is almost always lower in the blue\nand higher in the red. The position angle also varies as a function of the wavelength, with different\ndependencies on the wavelength. Both AK Sco's polarization level and position angle vary as a\nfunction of time and wavelength.\nLarge amplitude variations are also seen in photometry, with typical amplitudes of 0.5 mag in\nV , 0.12 mag in B \u2212 V and 0.20 mag in U \u2212 B. These photometric variations are also correlated\nto the polarimetric ones: usually, when the star is bright, its polarization is small, and when the\npolarization is large, the star is fainter and redder. These photometric and polarimetric variations\nare compatible with occultation by a CS dust cloud in orbit in a dusty circumbinary envelope. The\ncolor-magnitude diagram B \u2212 V , V exhibits a ratio of total to selective absorption of R = 4.3,\nhigher than in normal interstellar clouds where R = 3.1, and characteristic of circumstellar (as\nopposed to interstellar) matter. There is no evidence for eclipses of one component of the binary\nby the other, in both the photometric and the polarimetric data.\nSince numerical simulations produce high-amplitude variations for circumstellar disks rather\nthan for circumbinary disks, this suggests the presence of CS (and maybe also CB) disks, although\nthe short period does not allow large CS disks. Alternatively, this indicates that there is matter\nclose to the stars, for example in a CB disk whose central cavity is not completely evacuated, or in\na stream from the CB disk to the star.\nA detailed analysis of the polarimetric data shows that the BME formalism, which could\nbe used to find the orbital inclination, is not able to recover that information. Even though an\ninclination higher than 63\u25e6 would help explain the anticorrelation between the star's brightness and\nits polarization if a cloud of dust passes in the line of sight, the BME inclination between 80 and\n90\u25e6 cannot be regarded as a meaningful result. Therefore, we cannot confirm the orbital inclinations\nfound by Andersen et al. (1989) or Alencar et al. (2003), 63\u25e6 , and 65\u25e6 < i < 70\u25e6 respectively.\nThe BME results concerning the moments of the distribution are interesting. AK Sco has\nvalues of \u03c40 G and \u03c40 H a factor 10 higher than for other binaries.\nThere are many free parameters, and even with the known inclination and eccentricity, our\nnumerical simulations could not reproduce the observations. The maximum polarization amplitude\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nwe can obtain with a single scattering model assuming an axially symmetric density distribution of\nscatterers around the center of mass (CB envelope) or around a single star (CS disk), is 0.20%. Two\navenues to explore further are: take into account multiple scattering, and include non-axisymmetric\ndensity distributions such as a stream of material falling onto a component of the binary (or both).\nWe thank the Conseil de Recherche en Sciences Naturelles et G\u00e9nie of Canada for supporting\nthis research.

Polarization data are from\nthe Heiles (2000) catalog. The computed average interstellar polarization for AK Sco is shown at\nthe position of the hexagon. See text for details.\nFig. 2.- Polarimetric observations of AK Sco in the 3550\u00c5 filter. The ephemeris used for the\norbital phase is 49000.0 + 13.6093E, with the period from Mathieu (1994). Periastron occurs at\n46654.3634\u00b10.0086 (Alencar et al. 2003) which corresponds to a phase of 0.64 in this figure and\nthe following ones. The open circles are duplicates of filled circles and were added for clarity. A\nfew observations are clearly away from the average curve, in both polarization and position angle,\nand are due to intrinsic variations. The solid line is the Fourier fit made according to Equations 1\nand 2.\nFig. 3.- Same as Figure 2, for the wavelength 4300\u00c5.\nFig. 4.- Same as Figure 2, for the wavelength 5250\u00c5.\nFig. 5.- Photometric observations of AK Sco from 1982 February.\nFig. 6.- Color-magnitude plot of AK Sco in V and B. The solid line is the fit to the data and\nindicates a ratio of total to selective absorption of R = 4.3, lower than in IS clouds (dashed line).\nFig. 7.- Polarization in the V band as a function of the B \u2212 V color: the polarization is generally\nlower when the star is bluer.\nFig. 8.- Photometry and polarimetry of AK Sco in the B band.\nFig. 9.- Numerical simulation for AK Sco surrounded by a circumbinary disk.
