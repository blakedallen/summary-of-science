Massive protostars form in complex clusters and predominately at distances greater than a kiloparsec making them challenging to study (Zinnecker and Yorke\n2007). Unfortunately, the tools used to study low mass YSOs (primarily near-IR imaging)\nare largely inapplicable due to extreme dust obscuration even into the mid-IR. Radio and millimeter wavelengths penetrate the dust, and have revealed a wide variety of phenomena associated with MYSOs: CH3 OH, H2 O, and OH masers, hyper-compact (HC) and ultra-compact\n(UC) H ii regions, recombination lines, infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), warm (> 30 K) dust\ncores, massive outflows, extended 4.5 \u03bcm emission from shocks, and hot core line emission.\nHowever, these signposts have been compiled from a heterogeneous set of observations with\nvarying angular resolution and sensitivity, making correlation analyses difficult.\nIn order to advance our understanding of MYSOs, we are using the EVLA to observe\n24 MYSOs with \u223c 10, 000 AU resolution in 1.3 cm continuum and a comprehensive set of\ndiagnostic lines simultaneously. This resident shared risk observing project is among the\nfirst to utilize 16 spectral windows with high spectral resolution including: the NH3 ladder\nfrom (1,1) to (6,6) (El =23 - 540 K); four CH3 OH transitions that can show maser emission;\ntwo H recombination lines; and other potential hot core species; plus reasonable continuum\nsensitivity. The majority (22/24) of our sample originates from the Cyganowski et al. (2008)\ncatalog of MYSO outflow candidates (extended green objects, EGOs, selected based on\nextended 4.5\u03bcm emission). Many EGOs are located in IRDCs (for an overview of IRDCs\nsee Rathborne et al. 2006), with a smaller subset associated with HC or UCHII regions.\nTo explore the range in the properties of MYSOs associated with extended 4.5\u03bcm shock\nemission, the sample includes five EGOs with compact HII regions, as well as two nonEGOs for comparison (an IRDC and a UCHII region). In this paper, we present the first\nresults from the survey by describing the observations of one source in detail: G35.03+0.35\n(hereafter, G35.03). To show the location of dust emission with respect to the centimeter\nemission, we include complementary 1.3 mm Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1.1.\n\nBackground on G35.03+0.35\n\nG35.03 is an EGO at a distance of \u223c 3.4 kpc with a bipolar 4.5 \u03bcm morphology oriented NE-SW at a systemic velocity of \u223c 53.1 km s\u22121 based on H13 CO+ (3-2) single dish\ndata (Cyganowski et al. 2009). A saturated Spitzer MIPSGAL 24 \u03bcm source is located\nnear the center of the two lobes and is coincident with five compact centimeter continuum\nsources called CM1...CM5 in order of decreasing flux (Cyganowski et al. 2011). CM1 has a\nflat centimeter spectral index (\u03b1 \u223c \u22120.1, S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ) consistent with optically thin free-free\nemission from an UC H ii region (also see Kurtz et al. 1994; Argon et al. 2000). In contrast\nCM2 has a rising spectrum (\u03b1 \u223c +0.7), suggesting it may be a HC H ii region or wind/jet\nsource (Cyganowski et al. 2011). Coincident with CM2 are blueshifted Class-II 6.7 GHz\nCH3 OH masers (\u2206V \u223c 6 \u2212 12 km s\u22121 ; Cyganowski et al. 2009), blueshifted OH masers\n(\u2206V \u223c 3 \u221214 km s\u22121 ; Argon et al. 2000), and redshifted H2 O masers (\u2206V \u223c 13 \u221217 km s\u22121 ;\nForster and Caswell 1999). Additionally, an arc-like structure of outflow-tracing Class-I 44\nGHz CH3 OH masers are located toward the Eastern side of the EGO (Cyganowski et al.\n2009).\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe NRAO1 Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) observations are summarized in Table 1; see Perley et al. (2011) for additional details on the EVLA system. The EVLA data\nwere calibrated and imaged in CASA2 . All images were restored with a synthesized beam of\n3.\u2032\u2032 7 \u00d7 3.\u2032\u2032 0 (P.A.=\u221250\u25e6 ), corresponding to \u223c 12, 600 \u00d7 10, 000 AU at 3.4 kpc.\nThe SMA3 observations are also summarized in Table 1. The sidebands were centered\nat 220.1 and 230.1 GHz. The data were calibrated in MIRIAD, then exported to CASA\nfor self-calibration and imaging. In this paper we only consider the 1.3 mm continuum\ndata estimated from line-free channels in the uv-plane. The SMA spectral line data will be\ndescribed in a future publication.\n1\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated\nunder agreement by the Associated Universities, Inc.\n2\n3\n\nhttp://casa.nrao.edu/\n\nThe Submillimeter Array (SMA) is a collaborative project between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics of Taiwan.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n3.\n\nResults\n\nAs shown in Figure 1a, we detect three major regions of NH3 (1,1) emission: (i) the\nstrongest emission is coincident with the central region of the bipolar 4.5 \u03bcm nebulosity,\nthe five centimeter continuum sources described in \u00a71.1, and 6.7 GHz CH3 OH masers; (ii) a\nslightly weaker and more compact core coincident with the SW lobe of the bipolar 4.5 \u03bcm\nnebulosity; and (iii) a weak but extended core coincident with the IRDC \u223c 30\u2032\u2032 SW of the\nEGO. Figures 1b and c show the intensity weighted velocity field and velocity dispersion of\nthe NH3 (1,1) emission, respectively. The emission spans a velocity range of about 4 km s\u22121 ,\nwith a distinct NE-SW blue-red velocity gradient across the EGO. This velocity gradient is\nnot clearly associated with an outflow, but instead seems to trace a shift in systemic velocity\nacross the region. The mean systemic velocity toward the EGO and the \"Dark\" core to\nthe SW is \u223c 54 km s\u22121 . In the vicinity of the \"NE\" core (and the centimeter sources), the\nvelocity dispersion shows a marked increase from \u223c 0.6 km s\u22121 to values as high as \u223c 1.9\nkm s\u22121 . There are also \"fingers\" of weak NH3 emission evident around the periphery of the\nEGO \u2013 these fingers are not apparent in the integrated intensity map (Fig. 1a) because as\ndemonstrated in Fig. 1c they have extremely narrow velocity dispersion (\u223c 0.25 km s\u22121 ).\nFigure 2a shows a detailed comparison of the EVLA NH3 (1,1) integrated intensity, SMA\n1.3 mm continuum, and the VLA 3.6 cm continuum (Cyganowski et al. 2011, CM1 and CM2\nare also detected in the line free channels of the current EVLA data; albeit at lower angular\nresolution and sensitivity). Overall, there is strong agreement between the NH3 and 1.3 mm\ncontinuum emission. The strongest 1.3 mm emission arises from the NE core, coincident\nwith CM1 and CM2. Though it is difficult to quantify the free-free vs. dust contributions\nat 1.3 mm due to the mismatch in the continuum resolution (and uv\u2212coverage) between\nthe SMA, VLA, and EVLA (not shown), it is clear that a significant fraction must be due\nto dust. The morphology of the NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) emission (see Fig. 2b), along with the\n1.3 mm emission to the NW of CM2, suggests the presence of a third compact source in the\nNE core lacking in free-free emission. Millimeter continuum emission is also visible to the\nEast-SE of the NE-core that partially coincides with the arc of 44 GHz CH3 OH masers, and\nmimics the morphology of the NH3 (1,1) integrated intensity. The SW NH3 core also has\na 1.3 mm counterpart. The \"Dark\" ammonia core was not detected by the SMA, probably\ndue to the smaller primary beam of these data.\nFigure 2c gives a detailed comparison of the NH3 (1,1), (3,3), and (6,6) integrated intensities. Significant (3,3) emission is detected toward both the NE and SW core regions,\nthough the strongest emission is compact and located East of the EGO, toward the SE terminus of the 44 GHz maser arc. Interestingly, this region shows only weak para-NH3 emission\nsuggesting a non-thermal origin for the (3,3) emission, though it appears to be connected\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nto CM2 through a weaker ridge of warm thermal NH3 emission. The (6,6) transition is also\ndetected at the (3,3) peak, as well as toward the candidate HC H ii region CM2.\nWe also detect strong, spatially-unresolved emission in the CH3 OH 52 \u2212 51 and 82 \u2212 81\nlines at two distinct positions (Fig. 3). Using an upper limit to the fitted size of the emission\n(1.\u2032\u2032 5\u00d70.\u2032\u2032 6), their peak flux densities (187\u00b12 mJy beam\u22121 and 39\u00b12 mJy beam\u22121 ) correspond\nto brightness temperatures (Tb ) exceeding 400 and 85 K for the stronger and weaker source,\nrespectively. These high Tb compared to the energy levels above ground (57 and 105 K)\nstrongly suggest that these transitions are masing (25 GHz CH3 OH masers have also been\nobserved for example in IRAS16547-4247, Voronkov et al. 2006). Interestingly, the transition\nof peak maser intensity switches from 52 \u2212 51 for the stronger maser spot, to 82 \u2212 81 for the\nweaker maser spot. The positions and peak velocities are (J2000) 18h54m 01.043s (\u00b10.002s),\n+02\u25e6 01\u2032 16.\u2032\u2032 86 (\u00b10.\u2032\u2032 02) at 52.8 km s\u22121 , and 18h54m 00.562s (\u00b10.002s), +02\u25e6 01\u203217.\u2032\u2032 67 (\u00b10.\u2032\u2032 02)\nat 55.2 km s\u22121 for the strong and weak masers, respectively (see Fig. 2a,b,c).\nNo emission greater than 5\u03c3 was detected for the SO2 , DC3 N, HC5 N, and HC9 N transitions. The H63\u03b1 and H64\u03b1 recombination lines were detected toward the CM1 UC H ii\nregion at a peak velocity of 55.9 km s\u22121 . Following the method of Garay et al. (1986), we\nuse the line-to-continuum intensity ratio of 0.46, the fitted FWHM linewidth of 17.6 km s\u22121 ,\nand the diameter of CM1 determined from the EVLA 1.3 cm continuum (1.\u2032\u2032 3) to derive an\nelectron temperature of 7900 K and density of 1.3 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 .\n\n3.1.\n\nNH3 Temperatures\n\nOver the last few decades considerable progress has been made in understanding the\nexcitation of the NH3 molecule under astrophysical conditions (see e.g. Maret et al. 2009).\nFor example in cold regions, analysis of the (1,1) and (2,2) transitions has evolved toward\nsimultaneous least squares-fitting of the line profiles \u2013 freeing the analysis from previous\nfailures wherever the intensity of (2,2) rivals (1,1) (e.g. Rosolowsky et al. 2008). However,\nthis type of analysis typically assumes that the kinetic temperature is much less than the\nenergy gap between levels (41.5 K) such that only the (1,1) and (2,2) rotational levels are\npopulated. Due to these assumptions, this technique becomes less accurate above temperatures of about 30 K. Generic molecular modeling packages exist that can be used to model\nNH3 emission from higher lying transitions using either radiative transfer with collisional\nexcitation, or assuming LTE. However, no package currently combines separate ortho and\npara collision rates (with realistic collision partners) with the detailed hyperfine structure of\nNH3 and a partition function that includes all relevant states that may be excited in warm\ngas (though we can expect this situation to improve in the near future).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nFor the current preliminary analysis we have pursued the following course: (1) in\nthe colder regions of G35.03 we have fit simultaneously the full hyperfine structure of the\n(1,1) and (2,2) lines using a non-linear, least squares Gaussian fitting routine given a single common line-of sight-velocity, line width, excitation, and kinetic temperatures in IDL\n(Friesen et al. 2009); (2) In the warmer, and coincidentally more kinematically complex regions we have used the LTE method in the CASSIS4 package to model all six observed NH3\ntransitions, including multiple velocity components where necessary. To compare methods,\nwe also fit the cooler regions with CASSIS. Figure 3a shows the results from technique\n(1), with grey areas indicating where this method's assumptions are invalid. The fitted parameters for both techniques toward several representative positions are given in Table 2.\nThe corresponding spectral line fits for these positions using technique (2) are shown in\nFigure 3d-h.\nAs shown in Table 2, the temperatures in the kinematically-simple Dark and SW core\nregions are in the 20-30 K range, with the latter being somewhat warmer on average. Both\nmethods do a reasonable job here, with method (2) predicting about twice the total column\ndensity of (1), likely due to its more complete partition function. Toward the center of the\nNE core and along the 44 GHz maser arc, technique (1) breaks down for two reasons: (i)\nthe gas is warm (& 30 K) throughout this region (or even non-thermal; Fig. 3b) and (ii)\nthe lines become more kinematically complex with at least two distinct velocity components\nseparated by about 1.7 km s\u22121 , or in the case of CM2 what appears to be a significantly\nblueshifted hot (220 K) outflow component. Towards CM1, the redder velocity component\nshows temperatures as high as \u223c 70 K.\n\n3.2.\n\nDust Mass\n\nThe average column densities and masses of the NE and SW cores based on the methodology described in Brogan et al. (2009, in Eqs. 4 and 5) using the 1.3 mm SMA data are\nshown in Table 2. The integrated 1.3 mm flux densities of the NE and SW cores are 831\nand 170 mJy with estimated sizes of 11.0\u2032\u2032 and 6.8\u2032\u2032 , respectively. For the NE core, we have\nsubtracted 25 mJy to account for the 3.6 cm flux of CM1 and CM2 (see Fig.2) assuming\nthey are due entirely to free-free emission and using the 1.3 cm to 3.6 cm spectral indices\nderived by Cyganowski et al. (2011). For the range of temperatures derived from the NH3\nfits described in \u00a73.1, the NE and SW cores have dust-based gas masses in the 50 - 132 M\u2299\nand 22 - 45 M\u2299 range, respectively, and average column densities of (3 \u2212 7) \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 .\n4\n\nCASSIS has been developed by CESR-UPS/CNRS (http://cassis.cesr.fr).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nFor comparison, Hill et al. (2005) report a SEST SIMBA 1.2 mm based mass for the whole\nG35.03 region of 390 M\u2299 assuming a dust temperature of 20 K and a total size of 55\u2032\u2032 (includes the \"Dark core\" in addition to the NE and SW cores). The Bolocam Galactic Plane\nSurvey (BGPS) catalog5 reports a 1.1 mm flux of 1380 and 3030 mJy for G35.03 within 40\u2032\u2032\nand 80\u2032\u2032 apertures, respectively (Rosolowsky et al. 2010). Assuming Tdust = 30 K for r < 20\u2032\u2032\nand Tdust = 20 K for 20\u2032\u2032 < r < 40\u2032\u2032 , we find a total mass for the region of 350 M\u2299 (550\nM\u2299 if we multiply by the BGPS \"correction factor\" of 1.5), in reasonable agreement with\nHill et al. (2005) and our SMA results, accounting for both the smaller primary beam and\nspatial filtering of the interferometer.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nProtocluster Nature of G35.03+0.35\n\nOur high angular resolution observations reveal the presence of at least three MYSOs\n(possibly four if CM3 is included) within 20,000 AU of one another in the NE core (CM1,\nCM2, and NWCM2). This configuration suggests a Trapezium-like protocluster of massive\nstars like those identified in other similar regions (e.g. Hunter et al. 2006; Rod\u00f3n et al. 2008).\nComponent CM1 is a modest UC H ii region associated with warm NH3 and hosts two velocity components which may indicate further unresolved structure. CM2 appears to be a\nHCH ii region or wind/jet source exciting OH, H2 O, and Class II CH3 OH masers, and a hot\n(220 K) blueshifted outflow. The millimeter continuum source NW of CM2 exhibits the peak\ndust emission, no centimeter continuum emission, but the broadest Gaussian (non-outflow)\nNH3 profiles. Such diversity among the continuum properties and in the molecular gas\ntemperatures toward these different objects is an increasingly familiar pattern seen in protoclusters (Zhang et al. 2007; Brogan et al. 2007). Similar to NGC6334I(N) (Brogan et al.\n2009), the systemic velocities of these objects differ by up to 1.7 km s\u22121 , providing a measure\nof the cluster dynamics. However, detailed study of the kinematics requires higher angular resolution followup observations, in particular to spatially resolve the multiple velocity\ncomponents toward the NE core objects.\n5\n\nBGPS: http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/BOLOCAM GPS/\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n4.2.\n\nNew Masers in G35.03+0.35\n\nAs Figs. 2c, and 3b demonstrate, the (3,3) and (6,6) NH3 emission toward the terminus\nof the 44 GHz CH3 OH maser arc shows significant departure from LTE. Unfortunately, our\ncurrent angular resolution precludes the measurement of the high brightness temperatures\nrequired for absolute confirmation of maser emission. Walmsley and Ungerechts (1983) first\npredicted that the (3,3) transition could undergo weak population inversion for densities\nof n \u223c 104\u22125 cm\u22123 and temperatures of \u223c 50 K \u2013 physical conditions common in massive\nmolecular outflows and similar to the conditions required to excite 44 GHz CH3 OH masers\n(Voronkov et al. 2005). We speculate that the non-thermal NH3 emission traces a bow\nshock from an outflow originating from CM2. Indeed, (3,3) maser emission has been detected\npreviously in several regions of massive star formation mostly associated with strong outflows\n(e.g. DR 21(OH), NGC 6334I, IRAS20126+4104, G5.89-0.39 Mangum and Wootten 1994;\nKraemer and Jackson 1995; Zhang et al. 1999; Hunter et al. 2008).\nThe stronger 25 GHz CH3 OH maser spot (Fig. 3c) is coincident in position and velocity\nwith one of the weaker 44 GHz Class I masers from Cyganowski et al. (2009), and is within\n1.3\u2032\u2032 of the strongest 44 GHz maser. The weaker 25 GHz maser spot is located towards the\nSE edge of the CM1 UCHII region. Class I CH3 OH masers are thought to be excited by\ncollisions in shocks, with the shock liberating methanol from dust grains and thus providing\nthe necessary high column density. Sobolev et al. (2005) suggest that 25 GHz Class I masers\nrequire densities of \u223c 105\u22127 cm\u22123 and temperatures of 75-100 K, hotter and denser than\nthat required for 44 GHz class I masers. As demonstrated by Voronkov et al. (2006) detailed\nmodeling of the ratio of brightness temperatures among the 25 GHz masing transitions can\nhelp to pinpoint the physical conditions. We hope to carry out such analysis for the ensemble\nof 25 GHz masers observed across our survey in the future.\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nWe present the first results from a 1.3 cm survey of MYSOs using the EVLA, focusing\non the EGO source G35.03+0.35. The new EVLA correlator allows us to simultaneously\nobserve the NH3 (1,1) to (6,6) transitions, four CH3 OH transions, two H recombination\nlines, and continuum. We find three major regions of dense NH3 gas, two (the NE and SW\ncores) being coincident with the EGO, and the third located in the adjacent IRDC. Using\ncomplementary SMA 1.3 mm and VLA 3.6 cm continuum data, along with temperatures\nderived from the NH3 emission, we find warm gas temperatures in the range 20-220 K,\ncore masses in the 20-130 M\u2299 range, and average H2 column densities of several \u00d71022\ncm\u22122 . Together these data reveal a massive protocluster in an early stage of formation with\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nmembers representing different phases of MYSO evolution concurrently. This work highlights\nthe potential diagnostic power that the full survey will provide toward understanding the\nformation of massive stars and protoclusters.\n\nBased on analysis using the CDMS, JPL, and Splatalogue spectroscopic databases,\nNASA's Astrophysics Data System Bibliographic Services, and the SIMBAD database.\n\nREFERENCES\nArgon, A.
