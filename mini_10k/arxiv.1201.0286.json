In particular, we discuss the couplings to Dirac fields and spin fluids: in\nthe case of Dirac fields, we discuss how in our approach, the Dirac self-interactions\ndepend on the coupling constant as a parameter that may even make these nonlinearities manifest at subatomic scales, showing different applications according to\nthe value of the parameter we have assigned; in the case of spin fluids, we discuss\nFLRW cosmological models arising from the proposed theory.\nKeywords: Einstein-Cartan Theory, Torsion Tensor, Dirac Field, Spin\nFluid\nPACS: 04.20.Gz, 04.20.-q, 04.50.Kd, 04.40.Nr\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe issue about the torsional completion of gravity has already covered several decades,\nand still it is not fully resolved: although torsion is a natural part of the most complete\nmetric-compatible connection, nevertheless there are also reasons against torsion that are\nadmittedly justified. In this paper, we are going to bring new insights in this topic.\nAs we have just mentioned, once the covariant derivative is written in the most general\nway, it is defined upon a connection that in general is not symmetric in the two lower\nindices, and therefore torsion does not generally vanish; although the implementation\nof the principle of equivalence and causality may seem to impose the symmetry of the\nconnection, and thus restricting torsion to be equal to zero [1, 2], nevertheless a deeper\nanalysis has shown that even in the case in which these principles hold then torsion is\nonly restricted to be completely antisymmetric [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]: the inclusion of torsion\nbeside the curvature makes it possible to introduce a torsion-spin coupling beside the\ncurvature-energy coupling, fully realizing the geometry-matter coupling prescription. It is\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\nvignolo@diptem.unige.it\nfabbri@diptem.unige.it\n\u2021 E-mail: cosmo@na.infn.it\n\u2020 E-mail:\n\n1\n\n\factually quite intriguing that if torsion is completely antisymmetric this complete coupling\nprescription could only be realized by the one fermion field that we have ever been able\nto observe at the moment [8, 9]; and if we now focus on this single fermion field, namely\nthe Dirac spinor, the torsional effects manifest themselves as self-interactions, capable of\ngiving a dynamical explanation of the exclusion principle [10].\nHowever, there are also problems that seem to push against the acceptation of torsion:\nthe most important of which is the fact that the torsional effects influence the dynamics\nonly at the Planck scale and not much beyond, making torsion negligible in almost every\nsituation; this is due to the fact that torsion has a coupling constant that is the gravitational constant. The fact that torsion and curvature share the coupling constant might\nhave been thought to have something to do with the fact that both fields are geometrical\nfields and therefore with the same strength; on the other hand however, despite torsion\nand curvature come in fact from a common geometrical background, nevertheless they\nare independent fields, and consequently endowing them with an identical strength is not\njustifiable a priori, and they should in general have different coupling constants. In the\npresent paper, we shall propound what we believe to be one of the simplest theories of\ngravity where torsion is present with its own coupling constant, showing that the presence\nof torsion with a properly tuned coupling gives consequences already at subatomic scales.\nThis theory of gravity is simply based on the idea that, as for a complete description\nof the underlying geometrical properties not only curvature but also torsion is to be considered, then in order to study the dynamical properties the Lagrangian should not only\nbe written in terms of the curvature but also torsional terms: this extension is natural and\nin literature it has already been put forward [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]; in those papers, when all\nresults are accounted, one may see that there are several terms that need be added to the\nLagrangian, but if one assumes the least-order derivative hypothesis, then there can only\nbe terms that in the curvature are linear and in torsion are quadratic, so that if one additionally wants to neglect parity-violating terms then one is left with the usual torsionless\nLagrangian plus three torsion-squared contributions [16]. Here however we would like to\nconsider only one of these contributions, since we are not interested in developing the most\nmathematically comprehensive of the models but its physical consequences; thus instead\nof dwelling in all mathematical details of the most general theory, we shall focus on a\nspecific model so to have a clearer look at the modifications that such a generalization will\nbring into the phenomenological aspects. As we will see, the presence of this additional\nquadratic-torsion term will have the effect of producing a shift in the value of the constant\nwith which torsion couples to matter fields, so that the torsional coupling constant is not\nnecessarily the Newton gravitational constant, and its value still to be determined may\nbe large indeed, and in particular one may employ this modification to see that torsional\neffects may be present in particle physics and amplified in cosmology.\nIn particular, for particle physics like in [16] we are here going to study the seminal case\nof Dirac fields, while for the cosmological applications differently from [16] where ELKO\nhave been consider here we are going to employ the spin fluid; in addition we will employ\na different formalism [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] to write the structure of the theory.\nThe layout of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we recall the main features of the\nJ -bundles geometry, in which we develop our physical theory; in section 3 we formulate\nthe square-torsion modification of the original Einstein-Cartan theory, showing that in\nthis way curvature and torsion appear in the dynamical field equations each with its own\ncoupling constant; in section 4 we apply this model to two of the most relevant matter\nfields with spin, the Dirac spinor and the spin fluid: for the Dirac field we discuss how, by\nchoosing a suitable value for the coupling constant of torsion, it is possible to show that,\nin the case of two leptons, the Dirac equation has self-interactions that can be written\n2\n\n\fin the form of weak forces, while in the case of two neutrinos, those self-interactions can\nbe used to model neutrino oscillation; in the case of the spin fluid, we study cosmological\napplications, showing how the already known cosmological effects of torsion (absence of\ninitial singularity, initial accelerated expansion, horizon problem) may be affected by the\nchoice of the torsional coupling constant.\n\n2\n\nThe Geometrical Framework\n\nTo begin with, we shall recall the notation and convention we will employ in the following\nof the paper: readers that are familiar with the formalism of the J -bundles may skip\nthis sections and pass directly to the following one; those who are not, may also refer to\n[17, 18, 19, 20, 21] for further details.\nLet us consider a 4-dimensional manifold with a metric tensor g of signature \u03b7 =\n(1, 3) = (1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121). Let E be the co-frame bundle of M and P \u2192 M be a principal\nfiber bundle over M . We denote by C := J1 (P )/SO(1, 3) the space of principal connections\nover P , referring E and C to local coordinates xi , e\u03bci (i, \u03bc = 1, . . . , 4) and xi , \u03c9i \u03bc\u03bd (\u03bc < \u03bd).\nThe configuration space of our theory is the fibered product E \u00d7M C (E \u00d7C for short) over\nM . The dynamical fields are (local) sections of E \u00d7 C, namely pairs formed by a tetrad\nfield e(x) = e\u03bci (x) dxi and a spin connection 1-form \u03c9(x) = \u03c9i \u03bc\u03bd (x) dxi , automatically\nmetric-compatible with the metric g(x) = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd e\u03bc (x) \u2297 e\u03bd (x).\nWe consider the first J -bundle J (E \u00d7 C) associated with the fibration E \u00d7 C \u2192 M ;\nit is a fiber bundle built similarly to an ordinary jet-bundle, but the first order contact\nbetween sections is considered with respect to exterior differential.\nThe starting point is be the first jet-bundle J1 (E \u00d7 C) associated with the fibration\nE \u00d7 C \u2192 M , referred to local jet-coordinates xi , e\u03bci , \u03c9i \u03bc\u03bd , e\u03bcij , \u03c9ij \u03bc\u03bd . Then, we introduce\non J1 (E \u00d7 C) the following equivalence relation: let z = (xi , e\u03bci , \u03c9i \u03bc\u03bd , e\u03bcij , \u03c9ij \u03bc\u03bd ) and \u1e91 =\n(xi , \u00ea\u03bci , \u03c9\u0302i \u03bc\u03bd , \u00ea\u03bcij , \u03c9\u0302ij \u03bc\u03bd ) be two elements of J1 (E \u00d7 C), having the same projection x over\nM ; denoting by (e\u03bc (x), \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd (x)) and (\u00ea\u03bc (x), \u03c9\u0302 \u03bc\u03bd (x)) two different sections of the bundle\nE \u00d7 C \u2192 M , respectively chosen among the representatives of the equivalence classes z\nand \u1e91, we say that z is equivalent to \u1e91 if and only if\ne\u03bc (x) = \u00ea\u03bc (x),\n\n\u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd (x) = \u03c9\u0302 \u03bc\u03bd (x)\n\n(2.1a)\n\nand\nde\u03bc (x) = d\u00ea\u03bc (x),\n\nD\u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd (x) = D\u03c9\u0302 \u03bc\u03bd (x)\n\n(2.1b)\n\nwhere D denotes the covariant differential induced by the connection. In local coordinates,\nit is easily seen that z \u223c \u1e91 if and only if the following identities hold\ne\u03bci = \u00ea\u03bci ,\n(e\u03bcij \u2212 e\u03bcji ) = (\u00ea\u03bcij \u2212 \u00ea\u03bcji ),\n\n\u03c9i \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c9\u0302i \u03bc\u03bd\n(\u03c9ij \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03c9ji \u03bc\u03bd ) = (\u03c9\u0302ij \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03c9\u0302ji \u03bc\u03bd ).\n\n(2.2a)\n(2.2b)\n\nThe quotient space J1 (E \u00d7 C)/ \u223c is denoted by J (E \u00d7 C) and the corresponding canonical\nprojection is indicated by \u03c1 : J1 (E \u00d7 C) \u2192 J (E \u00d7 C). A system of local fibered coor\u03bc\ndinates on the bundle J (E \u00d7 C) is provided by the set of functions xi , e\u03bci , \u03c9i \u03bc\u03bd , Eij\n:=\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n1\n1\ne\n\u2212\ne\n\u03c9\n\u2212\n\u03c9\n,\n\u03a9\n:=\n(i\n<\nj).\nThe\nquotient\nprojection\n\u03c1\nendows\nthe\nij\nji\nij\nji\nij\n2\n2\nbundle J (E \u00d7C) with most of the standard features of jet-bundles geometry (J -extension of\nsections, contact forms, J -prolongation of morphisms and vector fields), which are needed\nto implement variational calculus on J (E \u00d7C). Referring the reader to [17, 18, 19, 20] for a\ndetailed discussion on J -bundles geometry, the relevant fact we need to recall here is that\n3\n\n\fthe components of the torsion and curvature tensors can be chosen as fiber J -coordinates\non J (E \u00d7 C).

This is however not the case in general: for instance,\nthe Einstein-Cartan theory, that is the simplest\np that can be derived within this formalism,\ncomes from a Lagrangian of the form LG = |g|R which clearly favours curvature tensor\nover torsion, despite the fact that both curvature and torsion are taken as dynamical\nvariables in deriving the field equations. So the Einstein-Cartan theory seems too simple.\nInasmuch as both curvature and torsion are taken as independent degrees of freedom,\na more general treatment allowing torsion not only implicitly within the curvature but\nalso explicitly on its own appears to be more elegant: an example of theories in which\ntorsion must be considered explicitly and not only implicitly through the curvature so\nthat the Lagrangian is constructed on an intertwined mix between torsion and curvature\ntensors are the conformal theories of gravity [22]. However, these theories have higherorder derivative Lagrangians, and consequently their torsion can propagate in regions in\nwhich the effects of torsion are expected to be vanishingly small [23]; even in the case in\nwhich torsion does vanish so that the field equations of Weyl gravity are recovered [24],\nthere are nevertheless solutions that do not reduce to those of the known Einstein limit\n[25, 26] and so it is not surprising that discrepancies with observations arise [27]. This is\nnot a peculiarity of conformal gravity but of all higher-order theories of gravitation, and\na wise choice might consequently be to look for theories that have least-order derivative\nLagrangians so to have chances to recover the proper limit.\nThe resulting situation is thus a balance between the issues of mathematical coherence\nand experimental consistency, the first pushing toward a generalization in which torsion\n5\n\n\fis included beside curvature while the second pulling to remain within the observational\nconstraints, a tension resolved by a gravitational Lagrangian of the least-order derivative\nin curvature and torsion. A gravitational Lagrangian of this kind, linear in curvature and\nquadratic in torsion is\nLG = eR + ekT\n(3.1)\nwhere e = det(e\u03bci ), R = Rij \u03bc\u03bd ei\u03bc ej\u03bd and T = Tpq \u03c3 T pq\u03c3 . In the Lagrangian (3.1), the\nfundamental constant for R is the Newton constant normalized to the unity while the\nfundamental constant for T is k yet to be determined. This gravitational Lagrangian is\nsupplemented by the matter Lagrangian LM in the full Lagrangian LG \u2212 LM as usual.\n\u2202ej\u03bd\n\u2202e\ni\nTaking the identities \u2202e\n= \u2212ei\u03bd ej\u03bc into account, we have\n\u03bc = ee\u03bc and\n\u2202e\u03bc\ni\n\ni\n\n\u0001\n\u2202LG\ni\n\u03bb\u03c3 i\n\u03c3 pq i\ni \u03c3 p\nk\n\u03bc = ee\u03bc R \u2212 2eR\u03bc\u03c3 e\u03bb + ek Tpq T \u03c3 e\u03bc + 4T p T k\u03c3 e\u03bc\n\u2202ei\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u2202LG\n= 2e ek\u03bc ei\u03bd \u2212 ei\u03bc ek\u03bd\n\u2202Rki \u03bc\u03bd\n\n(3.2a)\n(3.2b)\n\n\u2202LG\n= 4ek\u03b7\u03bc\u03c3 Tst \u03c3 g js g it\n\u2202Tji\u03bc\n\n(3.2c)\n\nIn view of this and supposing LM independent of torsion and curvature, eqs.

Eq.

We stress that in the previous discussion we\nhave supposed k 6= {1, 41 , \u2212 12 }; such values of parameter k are pathological for the present\ntheory and they should be avoided. Indeed, it is easily seen that for k = {1, 41 , \u2212 21 }, eqs.\n(3.5) are unable to uniquely determine the whole torsion tensor.

When in gravity torsion is not neglected, nonlinearities as those given in [31] appear within the Dirac matter field equations, but when\nthe present modification of the torsional action is accounted, those non-linearities get a\ncoupling constant that is not necessarily the Newton constant: so it may seem that our\nmodification has the only effect of rescaling the torsional coupling constant and nothing\nmore. However, in a situation in which one of the most important effects of torsion is its\ninduced spin-contact coupling in the matter field equations and in a moment in which torsion tends to be neglected because such interactions are allegedly small, our modification,\nfar from being a mere rescaling of the torsion coupling constant, is what renders those\ninteractions relevant at scales in which torsion has always been assumed to be negligible,\nsolving the last impeachment torsion would have to face. The possibility to control the\ntorsional coupling constant gives one the opportunity to change its sign as well, making the\ntorsionally-induced interactions not only important at larger scales, but also attractive.\nIn fact, in the present theory as in the Einstein-Cartan theory, the Dirac field equations\nare of the Nambu-Jona\u2013Lasinio type [10]; however, in this model the Dirac field has\nself-interactions whose coupling constant can be taken with opposite sign, giving rise to\nNambu-Jona\u2013Lasinio attractive potentials [33]: in the low-energy limit, this gives the\npossibility to describe superconductivity, therefore providing a geometric interpretation.\nSince our modification affects only the value of the coupling constant, but not the\nstructure of the non-linearities, then our model has all advantages but also all disadvantages of the usual model of Dirac theory with torsion: for instance, the issue of chiral\nanomalies [34] and the fact that the non-linearities are perturbatively non-renormalizable\n[35]; for these, and maybe others, among all the problems the theory may have we furnish\nno solution more than those discussed in [34, 35], or in other works, and therefore our\nmodification is neither better, nor worse, than the usual theory discussed in the abovementioned references. By this we do not mean that these problems are not important,\nand on the contrary they ought be analyzed; what we only mean is that these issues are\nuntouched by the modification propounded by our work, and so we are not obliged to\ndiscuss them more than any other paper on torsion for Dirac fields. Our paper is focused\non the scaling of their coupling constant, and this is the key point we want to deepen next.\nIt is important to notice that no matter what this value is, it would at first be thinkable\nto normalize it to the usual value of the Newton constant through the normalization of\nthe Dirac field, but a deeper analysis shows that this process would also have the effect\nof changing the scale of the energy density within the gravitational field equations and it\nis therefore unacceptable: so far as our knowledge is concerned, the theory we have here\nconstructed is the only one in which the Einstein-Cartan-Dirac theory can be generalized in\norder for the system of field equations, once decomposed in terms of torsionless quantities\nplus torsional contributions written as Dirac field self-interactions, to provide a coupling\nconstant for self-interactions of matter leaving gravity unmodified.\n1. Neutrino oscillation in absence of mass states. The first example we will\nconsider in the case of a coupled system of fermions is given by the simplest couple of\nspinors, that is the pair of semispinors both massless; these semispinors without mass will\npossess spin-torsion coupling providing some sort of mixing between them despite the fact\nthat in the accepted model neutrinos only have massive oscillations: the aim is therefore\n\n11\n\n\fto compare this case with the accepted model to appreciate their discrepancies.\nConsidering the field equation for two semispinors without mass \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 we have\nthat their field equations are given by the usual field equations for semispinors taken to\nbe left-handed and so in the purely massless configuration\ni\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc \u03bd1 = 0\n\n(4.19)\n\ni\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc \u03bd2 = 0\n\n(4.20)\n\nin terms of the most general covariant derivatives D\u03bc that can be decomposed into the\nsimplest covariant derivatives D\u0303\u03bc as in the torsionless case plus torsional contributions as\ni\u03b3 \u03bc D\u0303\u03bc \u03bd1 + \u03bb\u03bd\u03042 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd2 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bd1 = 0\n\u03bc\n\n(4.21)\n\n\u03bc\n\ni\u03b3 D\u0303\u03bc \u03bd2 + \u03bb\u03bd\u03041 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd1 \u03b3 \u03bd2 = 0\n\n(4.22)\n\nwith spinorial interactions of each semispinor with the other; these have now to be written\nin an alternative form by employing Fierz identities \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c7 = \u2212\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c7\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8 valid for any\ncouple of left-handed semispinors \u03c8 and \u03c7 identically: after this Fierz rearrangement we\nget the previous field equations transcribed as\ni\u03b3 \u03bc D\u0303\u03bc \u03bd1 \u2212\ni\u03b3 \u03bc D\u0303\u03bc \u03bd2 \u2212\n\n2\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n3 (\u03bd\u03041 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd1 \u2212 \u03bd\u03042 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd2 ) \u03b3 \u03bd1 \u2212 3 (\u03bd\u03042 \u03b3 \u03bd1 ) \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd2\n2\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n3 (\u03bd\u03041 \u03b3 \u03bd2 ) \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd1 + 3 (\u03bd\u03041 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd1 \u2212 \u03bd\u03042 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd2 ) \u03b3 \u03bd2\n\n=0\n\n(4.23)\n\n=0\n\n(4.24)\n\nin which the interactions of each semispinor with the other has been written in a form\nthat is particularly interesting; in fact, such a coupled system of field equations is formally\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012 \u0013\n(\u03bd\u03041 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd1 \u2212 \u03bd\u03042 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd2 )\n2(\u03bd\u03041 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd2 )\u2217\n\u03bd1\n\u03bd\n=0\n(4.25)\ni\u03b3 \u03bc D\u0303\u03bc 1 + i\u03bb\n3\n2(\u03bd\u03041 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd2 )\n\u2212(\u03bd\u03041 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd1 \u2212 \u03bd\u03042 \u03b3\u03bc \u03bd2 ) \u03bd2\n\u03bd2\nin which we achieve a considerable compactification.

This is\na remarkable discrepancy between the present theory, in which it is precisely because\nneutrinos are massless that they may oscillate, and the commonly accepted theory, in\nwhich only massive neutrinos can possibly oscillate.\n2. Leptons with weak interactions and Higgs field. Our next example will be\nthe immediately more complex one, that is the coupled system of fermions, one of which\nis a spinor with mass while the other is a semispinor thus massless; these spinors with\nmassive states will possess spin-torsion coupling resulting in interactions between the two\nfundamental fields while from the point of view of the standard model the couple of electron\nand neutrino only has the weak interactions: the aim is therefore to compare this case\nwith that of the weak forces and see whether or not similarities may arise.\nIn this case the field equations for the electron and neutrino fields e and \u03bd are given\nby the previous field equations, but because now the system is constituted by a couple of\nspinors then the spin will be the sum of the two spins and the spinorial field equations are\ni\u03b3 \u03bc D\u0303\u03bc e \u2212 \u03bb (e\u03b3\u03bc e\u03b3 \u03bc e + \u03bd\u03b3\u03bc \u03bd\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 e) \u2212 me = 0\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\ni\u03b3 D\u0303\u03bc \u03bd \u2212 \u03bbe\u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 e\u03b3 \u03bd = 0\n\n(4.34)\n(4.35)\n\nin which the fact that the electron is massive while the neutrino is massless is the reason\nthat prevents these two fields to mix into a doublet; after by employing a Fierz rearrangement as we have done before, they can be cast into the form\ni\u03b3 \u03bc D\u0303\u03bc e + 2\u03bb(cos \u03b8)2 e\u03b35 e\u03b35 e +\n+q tan \u03b8Z\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc e \u2212\n\ng\n\u03bc\n2 cos \u03b8 Z\u03bc \u03b3 eL\n\ni\u03b3 \u03bc D\u0303\u03bc \u03bd +\n\n\u221ag W \u2217 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bd \u2212 He \u2212\n\u03bc\n2\ng\n+ \u221a2 W\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc eL = 0\n\n+\n\ng\n\u03bc\n2 cos \u03b8 Z\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd\n\nme = 0\n\n(4.36)\n(4.37)\n\nonce we define\n\u0011\n\u0003\u0010\n\u0002\nZ \u03bc = \u2212\u03bb 2(sin \u03b8)2 e\u03b3 \u03bc e \u2212 eL \u03b3 \u03bc eL + \u03bd\u03b3 \u03bc \u03bd cotq \u03b8\ni\nh\n\u03b8)2 \u22121\n\u221a\nW \u03bc = \u2212\u03bb (eL \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bd) 4(sin\nq 2 sin \u03b8\n13\n\n(4.38)\n(4.39)\n\n\fand\nH = \u03bbee2(cos \u03b8)2\n\n(4.40)\n\nshowing that field equations (4.36) and (4.37) are formally identical to the system of\nfield equations for the lepton fields after the symmetry breaking in the standard model,\nalthough both weak and Higgs boson fields are here composite [37].

Notice that with this fine-tuning\nfor the constant, the weak interactions are reproduced not only in structure but also in\nstrength while the masses of the composite mediators have not only the proper ratio but\nalso the correct value. This would imply that among theories coming from torsion and the\nstandard model, so long as we take into account leptonic weak scattering and the weak\nmediators masses it is not possible to appreciate any discrepancies, and we have to go\nto higher energies to see that in our model the weak mediators must display an internal\nstructure that can never be present for the standard model weak bosons [39].\nSimilar results have also been obtained both for leptons and hadrons in circumstances\nin which the underlying symmetry was still unbroken [40, 41].\n\n3. Dirac field as a Van der Waals gas. We will now leave the treatment of the\ncoupled system of Dirac fields to focus on the single Dirac field; writing the Dirac field\nequation in the standard representation allows us to obtain the slow-speed weak-field\napproximation\n\u0001\n1\nk\na\n\u2020\ni \u2202\u03c6\n(4.43)\n\u2202t + 2m \u03c3 D\u0303 k \u03c3 D\u0303 a \u03c6 \u2212 \u03bb \u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 \u2212 m\u03c6 = 0\n\nrepresenting cold-matter fields with self-interactions with the structure of an energy term.\nThus in the present theory we have that the Dirac field equations have the form of the\nNambu-Jona\u2013Lasinio field equation further approximated to the Pauli-Schr\u00f6dinger field\nequation of the Ginzburg-Landau type [10]. In it the coupling constant \u03bb is to be set on\nthe value of the specific condensed state system we would eventually like to study [33].\nThese field equations have energy levels that can easily be computed to be\nE =m+\n\np2\n2m\n\n+ \u03bbu2\n\n(4.44)\n\nwhere u2 is the square of the field, representing the density of the field itself, or equivalently\nin the quantum-mechanical interpretation the probability to find a give particle or again\nfor collective states the number of particles per unit volume u2 = N\nV ; on the other hand,\nthe usual thermodynamic interpretation of the kinetic energy is the temperature T of the\ngas under consideration: considering both these interpretations, the energy levels (4.44)\nreceive the quantum-mechanical thermodynamic interpretation of\nE = T + \u03bbN\nV\n14\n\n(4.45)\n\n\fwhich is the well known expression for the energy\u0001 level of the\n\u0001 Van der Waals gas.\n\u2202P\n\u2202E\n=\nBy employing the equation of the energy \u2202V\n\u2202T V T \u2212 P it is easy to see that\nT\nthe equation of state gives the pressure P as a function of volume and temperature as\n\u0001\nP \u2212 \u03bb VN2 F (V ) = T\n(4.46)\n\nas the Van der Waals equation of state with generalized volume factor F (V ) and with\ncoupling constant \u03bb determining the type of interaction of the gas: for the commonly\naccepted positive values the Van der Waals pressure is positive resulting into a repulsion,\nwhile for negative values the Van der Waals pressure is negative resulting into an attraction.\nThe interpretation of a Dirac field or a collective state of Dirac particles as a Van der\nWaals gas can be read by interpreting the torsionally-induced self-interactions as the Van\nder Waals interactions among different particles of the gas, as it might have been expected\nfrom the fact that both type of interactions drop with a r16 dependence [42].\n\n4.2\n\nThe Coupling to the Fluid with Spin\n\nThe importance of the Dirac field is mainly due to the fact that it is the simplest quantum\nfield that can be used in the description of natural phenomena, including even cosmological\napplications (see for instance [43]); other spin- 12 spinor fields like ELKO may also be used\nin cosmology such as those tackling the problem of Dark Matter [16]. In the present paper\nhowever, we wish to employ yet another matter field to describe large-scale structures: the\nfluid with spin, that is the Weyssenhoff fluid [44, 45].\nThe spin fluid is defined by its energy-momentum tensor, of the form\n\u0001\n(4.47a)\n\u03a3ij = U i P j + p U i U j \u2212 g ij\n\nand its spin density tensor given by\n\nSij h = Sij U h\n\n(4.47b)\n\nwhere U i (U i Ui = 1) and P i denote respectively the 4-velocity and the 4-vector density\nof energy-momentum, while Sij = \u2212Sji is the spin density of the fluid: the 4-velocity and\nthe spin satisfy the convective condition\nSij U j = 0.\n\n(4.48)\n\nMaking use of eqs. (3.15), (4.47b) and (4.48), we obtain the expression of the contorsion\nKtsi =\n\n1\n[\u2212A(k) (Ssti + Stis + Sist ) + B(k) (\u2212Stsi + Ssit \u2212 Sits )]\n2\n\nwhere\nA(k) =\n\n\u22122k\n(1 \u2212 4k)(1 + 2k)\n\nand\n\nB(k) =\n\n1\n(1 + 2k)\n\n(4.49)\n\n(4.50)\n\nand due to the convective condition (4.48), it is seen that torsion and contorsion tensors\nare both traceless. From this, we can write the Einstein-like equations in the form\n1\n \u0303 h Kji h \u2212 K p Kjph + 1 K ip Kip h gij +\nR\u0303ij \u2212 R\u0303gij \u2212 \u2207\nhi\n2\n2 h\n\u0001\nk\n \u0303 h T hij + 2kK p T hip = \u03a3ij\n\u2212 Tpqh T pqh gij + 4Tipq T pj q + 2k \u2207\nhj\n2\n15\n\n(4.51)\n\n\fIt is easy to verify that the antisymmetric part of (4.51)\n \u0303 h T h = \u03a3[ij]\n \u0303 h K h + 2k \u2207\n\u2212\u2207\n[ij]\n[ji]\n\n(4.52)\n\namounts to the conservation laws for the spin (3.19).

(3.5) into (4.53) and taking the identity Tij h = Kji h \u2212 Kij h into account,\nwe end up with eqs. (4.52).\nSaturating eqs.

Being the spin\nrandomly oriented, we can assume that the average of the spin and its gradient vanish,\nbut the same is not true for the spin-squared terms < S pq Spq >:= 21 S 2 . The conclusion\nfollows that, after averaging, eqs.

Under the stated conditions, it is easily seen\nthat the conservation laws (3.18) and (3.19) give rise respectively to the equations\n\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3 (\u03c1 + p)\n\n\u0227\n=0\na\n\n(4.61a)\n\n\u0227\n=0\n(4.61b)\na\nSupposing again a state equation of the kind p = \u03bb\u03c1 (0 \u2264 \u03bb < 1), eqs. (4.61) admit general\nsolutions\nS0\n(4.62)\n\u03c1 = \u03c10 a\u22123(1+\u03bb) ,\nS= 3\na\n\u03c10 and S0 being suitable integration constants. Eqs. (4.61) ensure that the quadridivergence (with respect to the Levi\u2013Civita covariant derivative) of the Einstein-like equations\n(4.58) vanishes, while eqs. (4.62) yield the relation\n\u1e60 + 3S\n\n2\n\nS =\n\nS02\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c10\n\n2\n\u0013 1+\u03bb\n\n(4.63)\n\nWe can see from the previous equations that the spin contributions introduce two important modifications in cosmology. The first one is that torsion may open closed universes,\nas a matter of fact from equation (4.60b) it follows that the critical density is defined by\n\u03c1c = H 2 + C(k)S 2\n\n(4.64)\n\naccordingly, those cosmological models with density \u03c1 such that\nH 2 < \u03c1 < H 2 + C(k)S 2\n\n(4.65)\n\nare closed in general relativity, but open in our theory.\nThe second important modification is that from eq. (4.60b) is easily seen that the spin\ncontributions can avoid the initial singularity. Indeed, supposing for simplicity the metric\n(4.57) spatially flat (K = 0) as well as C(k) > 0, from eqs. (4.60b), (4.62) and (4.63) we\nderive the existence of a minimum value ai for the scale factor\nC(k)S02\nai =\n\u03c10\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u0015 3(1\u2212\u03bb)\n\n(4.66)\n\ncorresponding to a maximum value \u03c1i of the energy density\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03c1i = \uf8f0\n\n2\n1+\u03bb\n\n1+\u03bb\n\uf8f9 1\u2212\u03bb\n\n\u03c10\n\uf8fb\nC(k)S02\n\n(4.67)\n\nMoreover, from eq. (4.60a) it is seen that we can have an initial accelerated expansion\n(\u00e4 > 0) for values of energy density\n\u0014\n\n2\n(1 + 3\u03bb) 1+\u03bb\n\u03c1 > \u03c1f =\n\u03c1\n0\n4C(k)S02\n\n17\n\n1+\u03bb\n\u0015 1\u2212\u03bb\n\n(4.68)\n\n\fThe value of the scale factor af associated with \u03c1f is\naf =\n\n\u0014\n\n4C(k)S02\n(1 + 3\u03bb)\u03c10\n\n1\n\u0015 3(1\u2212\u03bb)\n\n(4.69)\n\nSince \u03c1i > \u03c1f , the accelerated expansion stops when density \u03c1f and factor scale af are\nreached. It is worth noticing that, while the values of ai and af (as well as of \u03c1i and \u03c1f )\ndepend on the parameter k, their ratio af /ai does not and it is identical to the result\nalready obtained in the standard Einstein\u2013Cartan framework [46].\nIn view of this, the cases K 6= 0 seem then more interesting. To discuss this point, we\nlimit to consider a fluid with an equation of state of radiation kind \u03bb = 1/3. Accordingly,\nfrom eq. (4.60b) we find the minimal value ai by solving the equation (\u0227 = 0)\nC(k)S02\n\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u03c10 2 + 3K = 0\n4\na\na\n\n(4.70)\n\nThe solutions are\n\u03c10 \u00b1\n1\n=\na2\n\np\n\u03c120 \u2212 12KC(k)S02\nor\n2C(k)S02\n\na=\n\ns\n\nWhen K = 1, these solutions make sense only if\nC(k) \u2264\n\n2C(k)S02\np\n\u03c10 \u00b1 \u03c120 \u2212 12KC(k)S02\n\n\u03c120\n12S02\n\n(4.71)\n\n(4.72)\n\nrepresenting a further restriction on the parameter k (together with the requirement\nC(k) > 0). The two solutions (4.71) coincide with the minimum and the maximum\nreachable values of the scale factor of the universe.\nFor K = \u22121 the imaginary solution\ns\n2C(k)S02\np\n(4.73)\na=\n\u03c10 \u2212 \u03c120 + 12C(k)S02\n\nhas no physical meaning. So there is only a minimum\ns\n2C(k)S02\np\nai =\n\u03c10 + \u03c120 + 12C(k)S02\n\n(4.74)\n\nAnyway, in both cases K = \u00b11, from eq. (4.60a) it is seen that the universe can undergo\nan accelerated expansion for ai \u2264 a \u2264 af , where\ns\n2C(k)S02\n(4.75)\naf =\n\u03c10\n\nIn the case of a closed universe the final expansion is limited by the condition (4.72). In\nthe case of an open universe the ratio\ns\np\naf\n\u03c10 + \u03c120 + 12C(k)S02\n=\n(4.76)\nai\n\u03c10\n18\n\n\f+\n\ndepends actually on the parameter k. Note that C(k) \u2192 +\u221e for k \u2192 \u2212 21 . We conclude\nthat in this case the parameter k may be chosen in such a way that the accelerated\nexpansion is sufficiently long to predict a flat observed universe.\nAt the end of this section with add some final remarks about the horizon problem, one\nof the classical problems of cosmology.\nIt is well-known that in the general relativistic cosmological models the horizon problem\nis a consequence of the initial singularity. In fact, in general relativity, from the Friedmann\nequation\n\u0014\n\u0015\na2\n3K\n2\n\u0227 =\n\u2212 2 +\u03c1\n(4.77)\n3\na\nit follows that \u0227 \u2192 \u221e when a \u2192 0. This velocity must be compared with\ndr\nc\n=\u00b1\ndt\na\n\n(4.78)\n\nwhich has been obtained by imposing the condition ds2 = 0; this means that the signals\nexchanged in a fluid with equation of state p = \u03bb\u03c1 by different parts of the universe cannot\ngo faster than c/a , while the various regions of the universe move away more rapidly, when\na is very small. It follows that the particle horizon\nZ t0\ncdt\nl(t0 ) = a(t0 )\n(4.79)\na(t)\n0\nis finite, while H \u223c 1/t is not an integrable function in the same interval. The consequence\nis that there are regions of the universe which are not connected causally. In General\nRelativity this problem has been solved, together with the flatness problem and other\nclassical problems by introducing the inflationary scenario.\nBut comparing equations (4.77) and (4.78) we see that as the universe expands, there\nis an epoch when\n\u0227\nc\n>v= d\n(4.80)\na\na\nwhere v is the recession velocity related to the distance d by the Hubble law. So assuming\nin our theory a similar expansion law, but without the initial singularity and assuming\nthat C(k) is large enough, we can show that horizon defined by equation (4.79) can cover\na region large enough such that all the observed parts of the universe are in mutual causal\nconnection. This explains why all the regions of the universe show the same temperature\nand the same physical properties.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have constructed a generalization of the Einstein-Cartan gravity in which\nboth curvature and torsion are considered each with its own coupling constant, the one\nrelated to the curvature being the gravitational constant while the one related to torsion\nstill undetermined; we have applied this geometrical background to the case of Dirac fields\nand spin fluids, showing that the corresponding equations have torsional contributions\nwhose coupling constant can be suitably chosen: in the case of the coupling to Dirac\nspinors, we have shown, through two examples, that the torsional contributions with a\nproperly tuned coupling constant make the non-linearities of the Dirac equation relevant\nalready at subatomic scales; in the case of the spin fluid, where in cosmological models the\ntorsional contributions were already present, the tuning of the coupling constant amplifies\n19\n\n\fthem even more: in particular, in the case of spatially hyperbolic FLRW model, the\naccelerated expansion lasts longer, solving the horizon problem in a natural way.\nA problem this approach may not be able to address is the fact that there does not\nseem to be a unique value of the constant for which all of the applications we mentioned\nfit into the presented frame, and so only an even more general theory of gravity may be\nable to provide a running coupling constant, possibly scaling with the energy, such that\nall applications above, and maybe more, can fit into a single scheme [30].\nIf this approach of ours, as well as any of its generalizations, really works, then torsion\nwould not only be observable, but it might have already been observed, although we have\nnot been able to recognize it for what it is.\nWe are aware of the fact that torsion may not be the answer to all, and maybe not\neven to most, of the problems of physics, but it may possibly be for some of them, and\nour theory can allow us to see how.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
