Do local gravitational system, i.e., stars,\ngalaxies, galaxy clusters, or even black holes, expand with\nthe cosmic expansion? This issue has received much attention over the years [1\u201321], however, these discussions\noften produced contradictory results leaving the issue\nrather ambiguous (see [23\u201325] for reviews). It is generally believed that these contradictions are due to the use\nof different or unphysical coordinates, or of unphysical\nsolutions [9].\nIn order to address this issue, McVittie introduced\nhis renowned solution [26] in 1933; this was intended\nas describing a point mass embedded in a FriedmannRobertson-Walker (FRW) universe, but modern studies\nrevealed that the McVittie metric cannot describe a point\nmass [2, 6, 11, 27], but is rather interpreted as describing a black hole in a cosmological background [46, 47].\nEinstein and Strauss [28] introduced the Swiss-cheese\nmodel which is, however, unable to describe the Solar\nSystem and suffers from other limitations [1, 23]. Next,\nthe Vaidya [29], Thakurta, Sultana-Dyer [15, 30], and\nFaraoni-Jacques [31] solutions were found, and these solutions also describe black holes embedded in FRW universes, each with some restrictions. Either the cosmic\nfluid is restricted to be a cosmological constant (yielding\nthe Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution, a very special case,\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\ngaocj@bao.ac.cn\nxuelei@cosmology.bao.ac.cn\nygshen@center.shao.ac.cn\nvfaraoni@ubishops.ca\n\nindeed), or it must be a mixture of two perfect fluids, one\nof which is a null dust (for the Sultana-Dyer solution), or\nit is an imperfect fluid with heat flow instead of a simple\nperfect fluid (for the Faraoni-Jacques solution) [21, 27].\nIt is of interest to look for simpler exact solutions with a\nsingle perfect fluid as a source to address the issue of cosmic expansion versus local physics. The purpose of the\npresent paper is to derive such new solutions representing\na black hole in a FRW universe with a cosmic fluid consisting of dark matter, or of dark matter plus dark energy\n(possibly a cosmological constant), or of quintom matter\n[32]. These types of solution are also useful, if nothing\nelse as toy models, in the study of dynamical horizons\nand their thermodynamics [22, 42\u201345] and of primordial\nblack holes [33] as probes of the early universe [34, 35].\nRegarding the relation between cosmic expansion and\nlocal physics, Noerdlinger and Petrosian conclude their\nwork [4] by stating: \"Consider the possible expansion of\nclusters or superclusters of galaxies, of mean rest-mass\ndensity \u03c1c , immersed in a universe containing a gas of\nparticles having energy density \u03c1. It is shown that when\n\u03c1 > \u03c1c , the clusters or superclusters expand with the universe, but if \u03c1c \u226b \u03c1, the expansion is reduced in the ratio\n\u03c1/\u03c1c \". Unfortunately, this conclusion is drawn from the\nMcVittie solution, which can not describe realistically a\npoint mass, a star, or a cluster of galaxies in a FRW\nbackground. A similar conclusion was reached by Price\n[18] who discovered the \"all or nothing\" behavior (i.e.,\nweakly coupled systems are comoving while strongly coupled ones resist the cosmic expansion). However, Price's\nresult applies only to a de Sitter background, not to a\ngeneral FRW universe. As is well-known, de Sitter space\nis very special: the de Sitter metric can be put in static\nform in the spacetime region between the black hole and\nthe cosmological horizons, which explains why strongly\n\n\f2\nbound systems in this background do not expand [31].\nIn this paper, we present new solutions which we propose to interpret as describing cosmological black holes\nembedded in FRW backgrounds, with the advantage over\nprevious solutions [15, 26, 29\u201331] that they are sourced by\na single perfect fluid, without heat flux. These solutions\nlead to surprising results: the black hole AH decreases\nwith the expansion of the universe when the latter is\nDM- or (DM+DE)-dominated. Since the Misner-Sharp\nmass is a half of the radius of the AH, also the black hole\nmass decreases with the cosmic expansion. As the most\nstrongly bound gravitational system, it is intuitive that\nthe size of a black hole should increase with the expansion of the universe due to the swallowing of surrounding cosmic matter. However, this picture is incorrect in\ngeneral as the cosmic expansion \"wins\" over the local\ngravitational attraction of the black hole. The universe\nis always expanding after the Big Bang and the energy\ndensity of the cosmic fluid decreases with cosmic time.\nThe seemingly bizarre behavior of the Misner-Sharp mass\nderives from the fact that it is really a mass sum (i.e.,\nthe mass of the background fluid is included), and coincides with the Hawking-Hayward quasi-local mass [21].\nWe note that this is a purely classical effect which makes\nthe black hole mass decrease and has nothing to do with\nHawking radiation [36].\nIn a quintom-dominated universe, during the matter era the black hole mass decreases, while during the\nphantom-dominated epoch it increases. The physical reason is that the cosmic density first decreases and then\nincreases. Since the Misner-Sharp (MS) mass is the sum\nof the black hole mass and of the background mass, the\nblack hole mass first decreases and then increases. One\ninteresting result is that the black hole singularity will\nbecome naked before the Big Rip occurs, which violates\nthe Cosmic Censorship Conjecture [37]. So if the latter\nis correct, phantom matter may not exist in nature.\nIn this paper, we use units in which the speed of light\nc and Newton's constant G assume the value unity, and\nthe signature +2 for the metric. The paper is organized\nas follows: first we show that several known solutions\ncan not describe a black hole embedded in a matterdominated universe. Second, we present new solutions\ndescribing a black hole in a matter-dominated universe,\na dark matter plus cosmological constant-dominated universe, and a quintom-dominated universe. The last section contains the conclusions.\n\nII.\n\ncoordinates as\nh\n1\u2212\nds2 = \u2212 h\n1+\n\nM0\n2a(t)r\nM0\n2a(t)r\n\ni2\n\n2\n\ni2 dt + a (t)\n\n\u0001\n* dr2 + r2 d\u03a92 ,\n\n2\n\n\u0014\n\nM0\n1+\n2a (t) r\n\n\u00154\n(1)\n\nwhere the constant M0 reduces to the physical black hole\nmass when a(t) =const. (this can be seen by rescaling\nthe radial coordinate r \u2192 r\u0303 \u2261 ar), and the scale factor a(t) is an arbitrary function of the cosmic time t.\nWhen M0 = 0, the solution reduces to the spatially flat\nFRW metric, and at a first glance, it can be understood\nas representing a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in\na spatially flat FRW universe [4]. However, it is now\nknown that, with the exception of the Schwarzschild-de\nSitter solution, matters are more complicated because\nthe McVittie metric is singular on the 2-sphere r = 2M0 a\n(which reduces to the Schwarzschild horizon if a =const.)\n[6] and this singularity is spacelike [11]. It was claimed\nin the past that the McVittie metric describes a point\nmass located at r = 0 and embedded in a FRW universe.\nHowever, this point mass is, in general, surrounded by\nthe singularity at r = M0 /(2a). This singularity was\nstudied in Ref. [6]. Nolan [2] showed that it is a weak\nsingularity in the sense that an object falling onto the\nr = M0 /(2a) surface is not shrunk to zero volume, and\ntherefore the energy density of the surrounding fluid is\nfinite. However, the pressure diverges at r = M0 /(2a) together with the Ricci scalar R [6, 27]. While there is little\ndoubt that the McVittie metric represents some kind of\nstrongly gravitating central object, its physical interpretation is not completely clear and is still a subject of\ndebate [6, 11, 46, 47].\nIn view of this situation we show that, with the exception of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution, the McVittie solution is unable to describe a black hole or a point\nmass in a FRW universe when the equation of state of\nthe cosmic perfect fluid is p = w(t)\u03c1. The proof of this\nstatement proceeds as follows. The McVittie solution\nwas obtained by forbidding explicitly the accretion of\ncosmic fluid onto the central object. This requirement\ncorresponds to G10 = 0, which in turn implies that the\nstress-energy tensor component T01 = 0 and there is no\nradial flow of energy. Let us assume that the energymomentum tensor that sources the McVittie metric is\nthat of a perfect fluid, T\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c1 + p) U\u03bc U\u03bd + pg\u03bc\u03bd , where\nU\u03bc is the 4-velocity of the comoving observer, and \u03c1 and\np are the density and pressure of the fluid, respectively.\nBy substituting the metric and the energy-momentum\ntensor into the Einstein equations G\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0T\u03bc\u03bd , the resulting Einstein equations can be arranged as\n\nTHE MCVITTIE SOLUTION\n\n3H 2 = 8\u03c0\u03c1 ,\nA natural starting point to investigate the relation between cosmic expansion and local physics is the 1933\nMcVittie solution [26], which can be written in isotropic\n\n2\u00e4\nM0\n+ H 2 = \u22128\u03c0p \u2212\na\nar\n\n(2)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3 2\n\u1e22 \u2212 H \u2212 4\u03c0p , (3)\n2\n\n\f3\nwhere H = \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter and an overdot\ndenotes differentiation with respect to the cosmic time t.\nWe recognize eqs. (2) and (3) as the Friedmann and the\nacceleration equations, respectively.\nWe have p = 0 and p = \u03c1/3 for the matter-dominated\nand the radiation-dominated eras, respectively, while\np = w(t)\u03c1 with w < \u22121/3 for a dark energy-dominated\nuniverse. For all these cases, the equation of state assumes the form p = w(t)\u03c1. Eq. (2) tells us that \u03c1 depends\nonly on t and, since p = w(t)\u03c1, the same is true for p. In\n2\u00e4\n2\neq. (3), the expressions\na + H and\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u22128\u03c0p depend only\n\n0\non t, while \u2212 M\n\u1e22 \u2212 23 H 2 \u2212 4\u03c0p depends on both t\nar\nand r, therefore eq. (3) is satisfied if and only if\n\n3H 2 = 8\u03c0\u03c1 ,\n\u1e22 \u2212\n\n2\u00e4\n+ H 2 + 8\u03c0p = 0 ,\na\n\n3 2\nH \u2212 4\u03c0p = 0 .\n2\n\np = \u2212\u03c1 = const. ,\n\n\u0001\n* dr2 + r2 d\u03a92 ,\n\n(4)\n\n2\n\n= \u2212\n\n1\u2212\n1+\n\n\u0001\nM0 2\n2\n2r\n\u0001 dt\nM0 2\n2r\n\n+ a (t)\n\n2\n\n\u00134\n\u0012\nM0\n1+\n2r\n\n\u0001\n* dr2 + r2 d\u03a92 ,\n\na(t) = e\n\nHt\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. Therefore, the McVittie solution can not describe a black hole\nembedded in a matter-dominated, radiation-dominated,\nor dark energy-dominated universe with perfect fluid\nequation of state p = w(t)\u03c1. In one word, given the equation of state p = w(t)\u03c1, the McVittie solution is nothing\nbut the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution.\nActually, Kaloper et al. [46] have argued that in the\npresence of a cosmological constant, McVittie's solution\ndoes in fact represent a black hole in an expanding universe. Here we provide independent support for this\nstatement.\nRecently, assuming a specific function H(t) in the\nMcVittie solution, Lake and Abdelqader [47] performed\na detailed study of the particular McVittie solution and\ncorroborated the conclusion of Kaloper et al. Moreover,\nusing a tetrad-based method for solving Einstein's field\nequations, Nandra et al. [48] obtained solutions describing objects embedded in FRW universes which provide\na new perspective on the McVittie metric. The study\nof the global structure of the McVittie solution in [47]\nrevealed unexpected features which make this solution\nmuch more complicated than it would seem at a first\nsight. Something similar probably happens for the new\nsolutions presented here, although we will leave the detailed investigation of radial null geodesics and of the\nglobal structure to future work.\n\n(6)\n\nin which the function M (t) replaces the constant M0\nof the McVittie metric. This corresponds to lifting the\nMcVittie non-accretion restriction G10 = 0. This solution\nseems to describe a cosmological black hole embedded\nin a FRW background and presents advantages over the\nprevious Thakurta and Sultana-Dyer solutions [15, 30],\nds\n\nThese admit the unique solution\nH = const. ,\n\nof the McVittie solution\nh\ni2\nM(t)\n\u00154\n\u0014\n1 \u2212 2a(t)r\nM (t)\n2\n2\n2\nds = \u2212 h\ni2 dt + a (t) 1 +\n2a (t) r\nM(t)\n1 + 2a(t)r\n\n(7)\n\nin the sense that both the energy density and the pressure\nare finite near the black hole horizon, and the energy density is positive-definite [31]. Now let us examine whether\nit can describe a black hole embedded in FRW universe\nsourced by a perfect fluid.\nWe assume that the cosmological matter is described\nby the single perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor\nT\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c1 + p) U\u03bc U\u03bd + pg\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere U \u03bc is the 4-velocity of the fluid. The only nonvanishing components of the Einstein tensor are\nG00 =\n6 0 , G10 6= 0 ,\nG11 = G22 = G33 6= 0 .\n\n(9)\n\nIf a radial energy flow is allowed, the fluid four-velocity\nis\n\u0001\nU \u03bc = U 0 , U 1 , 0, 0 ,\n(10)\nand the normalization U\u03bc U \u03bc = \u22121 gives\n\uf8ees\n\uf8f9\n\u0012\n\u00134\nM (t)\nU \u03bc = \uf8f0 \u2212g 00 \u2212 a2 v 2 g 00 1 +\n, v, 0, 0\uf8fb ,(11)\n2a (t) r\n\nwhere v is the proper 3-velocity of the fluid. From G11 =\nG22 we conclude that\n\u00134\n\u0012\nM (t)\n2 2\n=0.\n(12)\n(\u03c1 + p) a v 1 +\n2a (t) r\nWe have two types of solutions characterized by\n\nIII.\n\nTHE FARAONI-JACQUES SOLUTION\n\nBecause the McVittie solution can not describe a black\nhole in a FRW universe, we turn our attention to the\nFaraoni-Jacques solution [31], which is a generalization\n\nv=0,\n\nM = M0\n\n(13)\n\n(which is the McVittie solution), or\np = \u2212\u03c1 ,\n\n(14)\n\n\f4\nwhich gives the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution. Therefore, the Faraoni-Jacques solution (and also the Thakurta\nand Sultana-Dyer solutions) can not describe a black hole\nembedded in a matter-dominated universe. In general,\nthey can not describe a black hole embedded in a single\nperfect fluid-dominated universe. However, the FaraoniJacques solution can describe a black hole embedded in\nFRW Universe provided that the source is given by an\nimperfect fluid with a heat flux:\nT\u03bc\u03bd = (p + \u03c1) U\u03bc U\u03bd + pg\u03bc\u03bd + q\u03bc U\u03bd + q\u03bd U\u03bc ,\n(15)\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n\u2212g 00 , 0, 0, 0 and q \u03bc = (0, q, 0, 0), where\nwhere U \u03bc =\nq is the heat flux density. This has been shown by us in\n[21].\nIV.\n\nTHE VAIDYA SOLUTION\n\nThe Vaidya metric is obtained by conformally transforming the Minkowski one:\n\u0001\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7) \u2212d\u03b7 2 + dr2 + r2 d\u03b82 + r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62\n2M0\n2\n(d\u03b7 + dr) ,\n(16)\n+\nr\nwhere M0 is the black hole mass and \u03b7 is the conformal\ntime. When M0 = 0 and a = \u03b7 2 , this metric reduces\nto that for a matter-dominated universe. On the other\nhand, when a =const., it reduces to the Schwarzschild\nmetric. At a first glance, one is tricked again into believing that this metric may describe a black hole in a\nmatter-dominated universe but this is incorrect, as shown\nbelow.\nThe energy-momentum tensor of dust or dark matter\nis\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1d U\u03bc U\u03bd .\n\n(17)\n\nDue to spherical symmetry, the four-velocity U \u03bc is written as eq. (10). We have two vanishing components of\nT\u03bc\u03bd , i.e., T22 and T33 , hence G22 = G33 = 0. Given the\nmetric (16), G22 = G33 is calculated as [27],\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n2\u00e4 \u02272\n2m\u00e4 4m\u02272\n= 0.\n(18)\n\u2212 4 +\n\u2212\na3\na\nra5\nra6\nThe terms in the first bracket depend only on time, while\nthose in the second bracket are r-dependent, so eq. (18)\nis satisfied if and only if\n2\u00e4 \u02272\n\u2212 4 =0,\na3\na\n\n\u00e4\n2\u02272\n\u2212\n=0.\na5\na6\n\n(19)\n\nThen we necessarily have the trivial solution a =const.,\nwhich is just the Schwarzschild metric. This shows that\nthe Vaidya solution can not describe a black hole embedded in a matter-dominated universe, either.\nThus far, we have shown that several known exact solutions can not describe a black hole in a matter-dominated\nuniverse. In the next section, we look for such a solution.\n\nV.\n\nBLACK HOLE IN A MATTER UNIVERSE\n\nA spherically symmetric inhomogeneous gravitational field produced by dark matter with energymomentum (17) is described by the Lema\u0131\u0302tre-TolmanBondi (LTB) metric [38] which, in the notation of [39],\nis given by\nds2 = \u2212dt2 +\n\nR\u20322\ndr2 + R2 d\u03a92 .\n1+f\n\n(20)\n\nHere f is an arbitrary function of the comoving coordinate r satisfying f > 1, R(t, r) is the physical radius at\ntime t and coordinate radius r, while a prime represents\ndifferentiation with respect to r.\nWith the energy momentum tensor (17) and the metric (20), the Einstein equations read\n\u0011\n\u0010\n3 \u1e582 \u2212 f\n8\u03c0F\n= 3 ,\n(21)\n2\nR\nR\nF\u2032\n= 3\u03c1d ,\nR2 R\u2032\n\n(22)\n\nwhere an overdot and a prime represent partial differentiation with respect to t and r, respectively, and F (r) is\nan arbitrary function of r. If we substitute\nf = \u2212f0 r2 ,\n\nF = \u03c10 r 3 ,\n\nR = a (t) r ,\n\ninto eqs. (21) and (22), the latter become\n\u0001\n3 \u02272 + f0\n8\u03c0\u03c10\n\u03c10\n= 3 , \u03c1d = 3 ,\na2\na\na\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nwith f0 and \u03c10 constants. We recognize eq. (24) as the\nFriedmann equation with a dust source, hence f0 represents the spatial curvature and \u03c10 the density of the\nuniverse at time a0 = 1. The observed universe is spatially flat with good accuracy (probably due to inflation)\nand we can neglect the curvature term in what follows\nby setting f = 0.\nFor an arbitrary function F (r) and f = 0, the solution\nof eq. (21) was given by Tolman [40] and Oppenheimer\nand Snyder [41] in their pioneering investigations of the\ngravitational collapse of dust as\n\"\n#2/3\nr\n3 8\u03c0\nR = h (r) +\nFt\n,\n(25)\n2\n3\nwhere the integration \"constant\" h is an arbitrary function of r. Substitution of eq. (25) into (20) yields\n\u0010\u221a \u0011\u00112\n\u221a\n1 \u0010\n+ R2 d\u03a92 . (26)\ndh + 6\u03c0 td\nds2 = \u2212dt2 +\nF\nR\n\nThere is actually less freedom in eq. (25) than is apparent\nfrom the two arbitrary functions F and h since F can be\ntaken as a new radial variable. It is convenient to choose\nh = r3/2 ,\n\n(27)\n\n\f5\nand\n\"\n\nR= r\n\n3\n+\n2\n\n3/2\n\nr\n\n8\u03c0\nFt\n3\n\n#2/3\n\n.\n\n(28)\n\nEq. (28) is the general solution representing a spherically\nsymmetric gravitational field with dust as a source. As\nshown above, this can describe a dust-dominated universe. On the other hand, if the dust disappears, it describes a vacuum, spherically symmetric, gravitational\nfield and reduces to the Schwarzschild metric due to\nthe Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem. By combining these considerations, one guesses that eq. (28) may describe a\nSchwarzschild black hole immersed in a dust-dominated\nuniverse. In the following, this claim is examined.\nA.\n\nMinkowski space\n\nBy solving the Einstein equations with \u03c1d = 0, one\nfinds the vacuum solution\nF = F0 ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere F0 is an integration constant. If F0 = 0, we obtain\nR = r and we recover the Minkowski solution.\nB.\n\ni.e., the Schwarzschild solution.\nThe physical meaning\n\u221a\nof F0 is derived from F0 = 2m and the Schwarzschild\nsolution is given by\n\u0014\n\u00152/3\n3\u221a\nR = r3/2 +\n2m t\n.\n(35)\n2\nC.\n\nDust-dominated universe\n\nEqs. (22) and (28) show that the homogeneous and\nisotropic, spatially flat, dust-dominated FRW solution is\nrecovered if and only if F = \u03c10 r3 . The dust universe\nsolution is then given by\n#2/3\n\"\nr\n3 8\u03c0\u03c10 3/2\n3/2\nr t\n.\n(36)\nR= r\n+\n2\n3\nThe scale factor and the density are\ni2/3\nhp\na=\n6\u03c0\u03c10 t + 1\n\n(37)\n\nand\n\n\u03c1d =\n\n\u03c10\n,\na3\n\n(38)\n\n1\n,\nrespectively, and it must be t \u2265 t0 , with t0 = \u2212 \u221a6\u03c0\u03c1\n0\nrepresenting the Big Bang.\n\nThe Schwarzschild solution\nD.\n\nIf F0 6= 0, we recover the Schwarzschild solution. It is\n3F 2\nconvenient to set F = 8\u03c00 with F0 a positive constant.\nThen, the Schwarzschild solution is given by\n\u0014\n\u00152/3\n3\nR = r3/2 + F0 t\n,\n2\n\n(30)\n\nF0 is determined by the mass m of the black hole.\nIn order to show this, let us rewrite the metric in\nSchwarzschild coordinates, setting\n\u0014\n\nx(t, r) = r\n\n3/2\n\n3\n+ F0 t\n2\n\n\u00152/3\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\nThen, eq.

It is clear, by comparison of eqs. (39) and (25),\nthat this is a solution of the full Einstein equations. The\nsubstitution of eq. (39) into eqs.

Then, the density\nis always positive. If m = 0, we have \u03c1d = \u03c10 /R3 , i.e.,\ndust or dark matter. Since R = 0 represents the Big\nBang, the latter occurs at the time\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\np\n3\u221a\n,\n(41)\n2m r\u22123/2 + 6\u03c0\u03c10\nt=\u2212\n2\nand the energy density is positive everywhere on the\nspacetime manifold.\n\n\f6\nVI.\n\nEVOLUTION OF THE APPARENT\nHORIZONS\n\nIn the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, there exist\na black hole apparent horizon (AH) and a cosmic AH.\nThe metric (20) describes a spherically symmetric and\ndynamical black hole in a FRW background more general than de Sitter. In this case, the event horizon may\nnot be well-defined, but the AH always exists. The AH\nis a marginally trapped surface with vanishing expansion\nand has been argued to be a causal horizon for a dynamical spacetime. The AH is associated with the Hawking\ntemperature, gravitational entropy and other thermodynamical aspects [42\u201345]. The first law of thermodynamics\nfor the AH has been derived not only in general relativity\nbut also in several other theories of gravity including the\nLovelock, nonlinear, scalar-tensor, and braneworld theories [49\u201355]. In view of this point, in order to investigate\nthe evolution of the black hole mass, we calculate the\nenergy contained inside the AH which has been used in\nblack hole thermodynamics in relation with energy flows\nthrough the AH [49, 56]. Let us proceed to calculate the\nradius of the black hole AH.\nFor a spherically symmetric spacetime with line element ds2 = h\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + x2 d\u03a92 , the generalized MisnerSharp mass is MMS = x (1 \u2212 h\u03bc\u03bd x,\u03bc x,\u03bd ) /2 [57]. At the\nAH, it is h\u03bc\u03bd x,\u03bc x,\u03bd = 0 and the generalized Misner-Sharp\nmass inside the AH is simply\nMMS = xAH /2 ,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere xAH is the radius of the AH. In order to know the\nevolution of the black hole MS mass, we need to know\nthe AH radius.\nWe rewrite eq.

As is\nclear from this figure, the radius of the black hole AH\ndecreases while that of the cosmic AH increases as the\nuniverse evolves. There was an early time at which the\ntwo horizons coincided, and before which both horizons\nwere absent and the singularity was naked. Since the MS\nmass is proportional to the radius of the black hole AH,\nthe MS mass of a black hole decreases with the evolution\nof the universe. The reason for this behavior can be understood as follows: with the expansion of the universe,\nthe cosmic density is decreasing, which is equivalent to a\ndecreasing of black hole AH, so the black hole MS mass\ndecreases.\n\n\f7\nVII.\n\nBLACK HOLE IN A \u039bCDM UNIVERSE\n\nAstronomical observations show that the present-day\nuniverse is dominated by dark energy [58, 59], hence we\nseek exact solutions describing a black hole immersed in\na mixture of dark matter and dark energy.

The size of the cosmic\nAH, instead, first increases and then decreases. There\nexists an instant of time in the past at which the two\nhorizons coincided. Both horizons disappear before the\nBig Rip, leaving behind a naked singularity and violating\nCosmic Censorship [37]. This result is consistent with our\nprevious discussion in [21]. The naked singularity does\nnot arise from regular Cauchy data, in fact it was already present before the appearance of the two apparent\nhorizons.\nThe reason for the increase of the black hole mass in the\nphantom-dominated epoch can be understood as follows:\nthe density of the universe is increasing, which makes the\nblack hole AH also increase. Hence, the black hole mass\n(one half of the AH radius) increases.

This includes the\nMcVittie, Thakurta, Sultana-Dyer, Vaidya, and FaraoniJacques solutions. Motivated by this fact, we have constructed exact solutions of the Einstein equations purporting to represent a black hole embedded in a background universe which are as simple as possible, beginning with solutions with a single perfect fluid. These new\nsolutions generalize the Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Tolman-Bondi metrics\n(which are restricted to dust universes) and do not exhibit accretion of the surrounding cosmic fluid onto the\ncentral black hole. We have found metrics which presumably describe a black hole immersed in a matterdominated, a matter plus dark energy-dominated universe, and a quintom-dominated universe, respectively.\nThe AH and the Misner-Sharp mass are related to the\nthermodynamics of dynamical black holes and FRW universes [42\u201345, 49\u201356], and, therefore, we investigate the\nevolution of the black hole and cosmic AHs, as well as the\nMisner-Sharp mass. We find that the black hole mass decreases in a matter- or matter plus cosmological constantdominated universe. In a quintom-dominated universe,\nthe black hole mass decreases in the matter era, while it\nincreases in the phantom-dominated epoch. The physical reason is that the cosmic density first decreases and\n\nthen increases, which makes the radius of the black hole\nAH first decreasing and then increasing. Then, also the\nblack hole mass (one half of the AH radius) first decreases\nand then increases. An interesting result is that the AHs\nwill disappear and the singularity will become naked before the Big Rip is reached, in violation of the Cosmic\nCensorship Conjecture [37]. If the latter is correct, then\nphantom matter may not be allowed to exist in nature.\nThis statement, however, must be taken with a grain of\nsalt: in fact, it is based on a particular solution of the field\nequations which may be very special. While the result\nis still interesting because very few exact solutions are\nknown to represent the physical situation under study,\nthe solution proposed may still be too special, or finetuned, to draw general conclusions. The phenomenology\nreported here, however, matches that obtained with very\ndifferent classes of solutions (which are indeed accreting\ncosmic fluid) in [21].\n\nAnother rather surprising result is that the black hole\nmass decreases in a matter-dominated universe. As the\nmost strongly bound gravitational system, it seems intuitive that a black hole will have its mass increasing\nbecause of the swallowing of surrounding cosmic matter.\nOur solution represents cases in which there is no accretion onto the central black hole (as described by G01 = 0)\nand in which the cosmic expansion \"wins\" over the local\ngravitational attraction. The universe is always expanding and the density of the cosmic fluid always decreases\nwith the cosmic time. The seemingly bizarre behavior of\nthe MS mass derives from the fact that it is really a mass\nsum (i.e., the mass of the background fluid is included),\nand it coincides with the Hawking-Hayward quasi-local\nmass [21]. In the absence of accretion of cosmic fluid\nonto the black hole, this mass sum decreases in any universe in which the cosmological fluid satisfies the weak\nenergy condition and its energy density decreases with\nthe cosmic expansion. In the presence of phantom matter\n(such as in the late epoch of a quintom-dominated universe), the weak energy condition is violated, the phantom energy becomes more concentrated, instead of being\ndiluted, with the cosmic expansion, and the mass sum\nincreases.\n\nFuture work will concentrate on studying the generality of the solutions presented here, and of previous solutions interpreted as black holes embedded in a cosmological space. To fully support the interpretation of these\nsolutions as black holes in a cosmological background, it\nis important that a detailed investigation on the global\nstructure of these spacetimes be provided. Until this\nglobal analysis is available, we cannot yet claim that our\nsolutions do represent black holes embedded in expanding universes, although there is circumstantial evidence.\nThis analysis will be carried out in future publications.\n\n\f12\n\nWe thank J.

This work\nis supported by the National Science Foundation of\nChina under the Key Project Grant 10533010, Grant\n10575004, Grant 10973014, and the 973 Project (No.\n\n2010CB833004). V.F. acknowledges the Natural Sciences\nand Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).\nAfter completion of this work, we learned that the solutions of Secs. V and VI can also be obtained as special cases of solutions studied by Krasinski, Hellaby, and\nJacewicz (see Ref. [3]). The solution of Secs. IX and\nX was already contained in Ref. [64] and is analogous\nto class-II Szekeres models. We thank A. Krasinski for\npointing this out.\n\n[1] W.B. Bonnor, Class. Quantum Grav. 16, 1313 (1999).\n[2] B.C. Nolan, Phys. Rev.
