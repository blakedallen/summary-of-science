Introduction\nJaime Keller [1] (cf. also the detailed analysis by da Rocha [2]) expressed\nconformal transformations via the adjoint representation of Spin(4, 2) acting\non paravectors of the Clifford algebra Cl4,1 and twistors as elements of a left\nminimal ideal of the Dirac-Clifford algebra C \u2297 Cl1,3 . This observation possibly contributed to his interest in a five\u2013dimensional formulation of physics,\nwhere, following Yu. B. Rumer (cf. [3, 4] and references therein), he gave the\ninterpretation of the fifth coordinate as related to action . He has elaborated\nthis idea in a sequence of papers using the name START (Space-Time-Action\nRelativity Theory) - cf. e.g. [5\u20137].\nIn the present paper we study some geometrical properties of two five\u2013\ndimensional homogeneous domains for the conformal group SO(4, 2)1 , with\nThis paper is dedicated to the memory of Jaime Keller .\n1 In the mathematical literature one can find several slightly different definitions of the\n\"conformal group\" of a pseudo\u2013Euclidean space Rr,s . Some authors define it as SO(r +\n1, s + 1), some other as P O(r + 1, s + 1). We choose simply O(r + 1, s + 1) because in our\n\n\f2\n\nArkadiusz Jadczyk\n\nthe hope that these properties may prove to be relevant for further extension\nof the ideas developed in Keller's START theory. We will also discuss some\nof the ideas of Keller's predecessor, Yu. B. Rumer, whose works have been\npublished only in Russian, and therefore are largely unknown for the rest of\nthe world.\n\n2. Conformally compactified Minkowski space as a boundary\nof five\u2013dimensional domains\nConformally compactified Minkowski space is the Shilov's boundary of an\neight\u2013dimensional complex domain\nSO(4, 2)/S(O(4) \u00d7 O(2)) \u2248 SU (2, 2)/S(U (2) \u00d7 U (2))\n- cf. [9] and references therein. But it can also be considered as a boundary\nof a five\u2013dimensional homogeneous space for the conformal group. We will\nnow study this latter case in some detail.\nWe denote by Rr,s the space vector space Rn , n = r + s endowed with\nthe quadratic form\nq(x) = (x1 )2 + ... + (xr )2 \u2212 (xr+1 )2 \u2212 ... \u2212 (xr+s )2 .\n\n(1)\nr,s\n\nWhen s = 0 (or when r = 0) the natural compactification of R = Rn\nis the Alexandroff's one-point compactification, that is the n-sphere S n . In\nother cases the natural compactification is the so-called conformal compactification . For the Minkowski space, r = 3, s = 1 (or r = 1, s = 3) the resulting\ncompactified space consists of the Minkowski space with added conformal\ninfinity - a three\u2013dimensional variety of a generalized Dupin cyclide, sometimes misleadingly called \"the light cone at infinity\" - cf. [9,10] and references\ntherein.\n2.1. Compactified Minkowski space\nAs we will see, compactified Minkowski space can be viewed as a four\u2013\ndimensional boundary between two five\u2013dimensional domains. Boundaries\nand regions close to boundaries are interesting. We can easily imagine that\nthe physical Reality is five\u2013dimensional and that, for reasons yet to be understood, our perception is restricted to a thin four\u2013dimensional boundary.\nWhile physics2 of such an approach may be still in a development (as in\nKaluza-Klein type theories or in Jaime Keller's unfinished START program),\nmathematics is not that difficult and we will describe it briefly in the following. Consider R4,2 endowed with coordinates X 1 , ..., X 6 , scalar product\n(X, Y ) = X 1 Y 1 + ... + X 4 Y 4 \u2212 X 5 Y 5 \u2212 X 6 Y 6 , and the quadratic form\nQ(X) = (X, X). There we have a null cone consisting of those X for which\n \u0303 inversions play a\nconstruction of the double cover of the compactified Minkowski space M\u0303\nnontrivial role.\n2 In fact, since we are dealing here with human perception, an interdisciplinary approach\nis needed, including the theory of information, biology, and even some philosophy.\n\n\fSTART in a five\u2013dimensional conformal domain\n\n3\n\n(X, X) = 0. This null cone is singular - it has an apex at X = 0 and it is\nuseful to remove this apex. Let us denote the remaining set by C :\nC = {X \u2208 R4,2 : (X, X) = 0, X 6= 0}.\n\n(2)\n\nThe standard way is to consider the set of all generator line of the cone\nQ(X) = (X, X) = 0 or, what is the same, to divide C by the equivalence\nrelation X \u223c Y if and only if X = cY for some c \u2208 R - then necessarily c 6= 0.\nThe resulting set (a projective quadric ) denoted M\u0303 , M\u0303 = C/ \u223c, happens to\nbe a four\u2013dimensional compact manifold, diffeomorphic to (S 3 \u00d7 S 1 )/Z2 - the\ncompactified Minkowski space. But there is another option: instead of taking\nthe quotient by real numbers, we can divide C by a stronger equivalence\nrelation, namely X \u2248 Y if and only if X = cY, c > 0. The resulting manifold\n \u0303 = C/ \u2248 is a double covering of M\u0303 . 3\nM\u0303\nWe can now embed Minkowski space M = R3,1 , with coordinates (x\u03bc ) =\n(x , ..., x4 ), and with the quadratic form\n1\n\nq(x) = (x1 )2 + ... + (x3 )2 \u2212 (x4 )2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nusing a variation of the standard formula (cf. [8, p. 80, (B)] and [9, Eq. (9)]):\n1\n1\n(4)\n\u03c4 (x) = (x, (1 \u2212 q(x)), \u2212 (1 + q(x)).\n2\n2\nIt can be easily verified that Q(\u03c4 (x)) = 0, thus \u03c4 (x) \u2208 C, and that X \u2208 C is in\n\u03c4 (M ) if and only if X 5 \u2212 X 6 = 1. The remaining part of C, namely the part\ncharacterized by the condition X 5 = X 6 , when divided by the equivalence\nrelation \u223c, projects onto conformal infinity.\nWith the stronger equivalence relation \u2248 we have two non intersecting em \u0303 described by:\nbeddings of M into M\u0303\n1\n1\n(5)\n\u03c4+ (x) = (x, (1 \u2212 q(x)), \u2212 (1 + q(x))).\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\u03c4\u2212 (x) = (x, \u2212 (1 \u2212 q(x)), (1 + q(x))).\n(6)\n2\n2\nCompactified Minkowski space, being a projection of the null cone C does not\ninherit from the quadratic form Q of R4,2 any natural pseudo-Riemannian\nstructure. It inherits only a conformal structure (of signature (3, 1)) - cf. [9].\n2.2. Compactified Minkowski space as a boundary\nThe null cone C of R4,2 separates two domains D\u00b1 characterized by the\ncondition\nD+ = {X \u2208 R4,2 : Q(X) > 0}, D\u2212 = {X \u2208 R4,2 : Q(X) < 0}.\n\n(7)\n\nLet us consider their projections D+ (resp. D\u2212 ) obtained by taking the quotient by the equivalence relation \u2248 . For every point of D+ (resp. D\u2212 ) there\n3 While\n\nphysics of such a construction is speculative, mathematically this second construction is not less natural than the standard one.\n\n\f4\n\nArkadiusz Jadczyk\n\nis a unique point X in D+ (resp. D\u2212 for which Q(X) = 1 (resp. Q(X) = \u22121).\nTherefore D\u00b1 can be identified with the hyperboloid \u03a3\u00b1 defined by\n\u03a3\u00b1 = {X \u2208 R4,2 : Q(X) = \u00b11}.\n\n(8)\n\nNow the quadratic form Q defines a pseudo-Riemannian metric on \u03a3\u00b1 . In\nfact we have the following theorem [12, p. 66]4\nTheorem 2.1. \u03a3+ (resp. \u03a3\u2212 ) is a complete pseudo\u2013Riemannian manifold of\nconstant curvature, of signature (3, 2) (resp. (4, 1)). The geodesics of \u03a3\u00b1 are\nintersections P \u2229 \u03a3\u00b1 of \u03a3\u00b1 with planes P through 0 in R4,2 . The group of all\nisometries of \u03a3\u00b1 is O(4, 2).\nSo, in the projective space P(R4,2 ) we have two five\u2013dimensional pseudoRiemannian manifolds of signatures (3, 2) and (4, 1) respectively, separated\nby a compact four\u2013dimensional manifold endowed with a conformal structure\nonly, of signature (3, 1) - the compactified Minkowski space.\nLet us look now at the topology of the two five\u2013dimensional domains \u03a3\u00b1 .\nFor the domain \u03a3+ we have the defining equation\n(X 1 )2 + ... + (X 3 )2 \u2212 (X 4 )2 + (X 5 )2 \u2212 (X 6 )2 = 1.\n\n(9)\n\nWe can write it as\n(X 1 )2 + ... + (X 3 )2 + (X 5 )2 = (X 4 )2 + (X 6 )2 + 1.\nIt is then clear that X 4 and X 6 can be arbitrary real numbers, and that\nintroducing Y i = X i /((X 4 )2 + (X 6 )2 + 1), (i = 1, 2, 3, 5) we have (Y 1 )2 +\n...(Y 3 )2 + (Y 5 )2 = 1. Therefore \u03a3+ has the topology of S 3 \u00d7 R2 . Using a\nsimilar reasoning we easily deduce that \u03a3\u2212 , defined by the condition\n(X 1 )2 + ... + (X 3 )2 \u2212 (X 4 )2 + (X 5 )2 \u2212 (X 6 )2 = \u22121\n\n(10)\n\nhas the topology of S 1 \u00d7 R4 .\n\n3. An explicit description of the domain \u03a3\u2212\nIn this section we will introduce a particular set of local coordinates in \u03a3\u2212\nand calculate an explicit expression for the induced metric. To this end will\nadapt the method discussed by Cannon et al. [13, Chapter 7] who, discussing\nthe \"Five Models of Hyperbolic Space\", similarly to Wolf [12, p. 70], considers\nonly the hyperbolic case of Rn\u22121,1 . Our case of R4,2 is somewhat more singular, thus some care needs to be taken, but otherwise the formal reasoning\nis similar.\n4 Thanks\n\nare due to Pierre Angl\u00e8s for bringing this reference to author's attention.\n\n\fSTART in a five\u2013dimensional conformal domain\n\n5\n\n3.1. Local coordinates and the metric\nIn \u03a3\u2212 we choose an open set defined by the condition X 5 \u2212 X 6 > 0. On this\nset we introduce five coordinates (x\u03bc , \u03bb) \u2208 R5 defined by\nx\u03bc =\n\n1\nX\u03bc\n,\u03bb = 5\n> 0.\nX5 \u2212 X6\nX \u2212 X6\n\n(11)\n\nOn the other hand, given a point in R5 with coordinates (x\u03bc , \u03bb > 0) we can\nembed it in \u03a3\u2212 as follows:\n(X \u03bc ) =\n\nx\u03bc\n1 \u2212 q(x) \u2212 \u03bb2\n1 + q(x) + \u03bb2\n, X5 =\n, X6 = \u2212\n.\n\u03bb\n2\u03bb\n2\u03bb\n\n(12)\n\nThe Reader is encouraged to verify by a straightforward calculation that,\nwith the above definition, Q(X(x\u03bc , \u03bb)) = \u22121, and that applying the formula\n(11) to X(x\u03bc , \u03bb) we indeed recover (x\u03bc , \u03bb). We can now calculate the metric.\nIn general, when we are dealing with an embedded manifold parameterized\nby coordinates x\u03b1 , the metric g\u03b1,\u03b2 induced from the metric GAB in which\nour manifold is embedded of is given by the expression\ng\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n\u2202X A \u2202X B\nGAB .\n\u2202x\u03b1 \u2202x\u03b2\n\n(13)\n\nIn our case (GAB ) = diag (1, 1, 1, \u22121, 1, \u22121) and it is easy to calculate\ng\u03b1\u03b2 using the formula (12). The result of a straightforward calculation is:\n(g\u03b1\u03b2 ) =\n\n1\ndiag (1, 1, 1, \u22121, 1).\n\u03bb2\n\n(14)\n\nExactly the same method applies to the region X 5 \u2212 X 6 < 0. We get a\nfive\u2013dimensional pseudo\u2013Riemannian, conformally flat, manifold of constant\ncurvature and signature (4, 1). We have covered by coordinates two regions\ncorresponding to different signs of the fifth coordinate. Physicists, when discussing representations of the conformal group with applications to elementary particle physics,often restrict their attention to these regions - cf. for\ninstance [14\u201316]. Yet evidently the group O(4, 2) acts on this part with singularities. Like in the case of Minkowski space in order to avoid singularities\none has to add \"conformal infinity\". In our case this is the region where\nX 5 = X 6 . This conformal infinity of the five\u2013dimensional domain has a simpler structure than the one for Minkowski space. In fact, setting X 5 = X 6 in\n(10) we get\n(X 1 )2 + ... + (X 3 )2 \u2212 (X 4 )2 = \u22121\nwith no scaling freedom.\nTherefore the conformal infinity of our five\u2013dimensional domain \u03a3\u2212 is the\nCartesian product of R (X 5 \u2212 X 6 \u2208 R) and the standard two-sheeted hyperboloid of Minkowski's space.\n\n\f6\n\nArkadiusz Jadczyk\n\n3.2. Christoffel symbols and geodesics\nGiven the metric (14) it is easy (in our coordinate patch) to calculate the\nChristoffel symbols \u0393\u03bc \u03bd\u03c3 and geodesic equations - cf. e.g. [18, Mathematica Programs: Christoffel Symbols and Geodesic Equations]. The metric is\nconformally flat and the only non\u2013vanishing Christoffel symbols are:\n1\n(15)\n\u0393\u03bc 5\u03c3 = \u2212 \u03b4\u03c3\u03bc\n\u03bb\n1\n(16)\n\u03935 \u03bd\u03c3 = \u03b7\u03bd\u03c3\n\u03bb\n1\n\u03935 55 = \u2212 .\n(17)\n\u03bb\nThe corresponding geodesic equations, when parametrized by an affine parameter s, are:\n2 dx\u03bc d\u03bb\nd2 x\u03bc\n=\nds2\n\u03bb ds\u0012 ds\n\u0013\ndx1 2\n1\ndx2 2\ndx3 2\ndx4 2\nd\u03bb 2\nd2 \u03bb\n(\n=\u2212\n) +(\n) +(\n) \u2212(\n) \u2212( ) ,\nds2\n\u03bb\nds\nds\nds\nds\nds\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03c3 = 1, .., 4, and \u03b7\u03bd\u03c3 is the flat Minkowski metric diag(1, 1, 1, \u22121).\nIt is interesting to notice that, for \u03bb = const., Minkowski's space null lines\nx\u03bc (s) = su\u03bc , where u\u03bc , \u03bc = (1, ..., 4) is a fixed null vector, are geodesics of\nthe five\u2013dimensional space.\nWhen \u03bb is non\u2013constant, it is convenient to choose \u03bb as a (non\u2013affine) parameter. The geodesic equations will read in such a case (adapted from [11, Appendix B, (B7)]):\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndx\u03bd\ndx\u03bc\ndx\u03bd dx\u03c3\nd2 x\u03bc\n\u03935 55 + 2\u03935 5\u03bd\n+ \u03935 \u03bd\u03c3\n0= 2 \u2212\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb d\u03bb\n\u03bd\n\u03c3\n\u03bd\ndx\ndx\ndx\n+ \u0393\u03bc 55 + 2\u0393\u03bc 5\u03bd\n+ \u0393\u03bc \u03bd\u03c3\n,\n(20)\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb d\u03bb\nwhich, in our case, reduce to:\n1 + x\u20322 (\u03bb)\n,\n(21)\n\u03bb\nwhere we denoted by a prime the derivative with respect to \u03bb, and used\n\u03bd\ndx\u03c3\n\u2032\u03bc\nthe notation x\u20322 (\u03bb) = \u03b7\u03bd\u03c3 dx\nis kept\nd\u03bb d\u03bb . The direction of the vector x\nconstant along the geodesics. Thus we need to consider three cases: x\u20322 =\n0, x\u20322 < 0, x\u20322 > 0. If x\u20322 = 0, we can use a Lorentz rotation (in the variables\nx\u03bc ) to set the direction of x\u2032\u03bc along the vector (1, 0, 0, 1). The differential\nequations reduce in this case to the following ones:\nx\u2032\u2032\u03bc (\u03bb) = x\u2032\u03bc (\u03bb)\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nx1 (\u03bb) = x1 (\u03bb)/\u03bb, x4 (\u03bb) = x4 (\u03bb)/\u03bb,\n\u20322\n\nwhich, taking into account the constraint x\n1\n\n2\n\nx (\u03bb) = a\u03bb +\n\nx10 ,\n\n4\n\n(22)\n\n= 0, solve to\n\nx (\u03bb) = a\u03bb2 + x40 ,\n\n(23)\n\n\fSTART in a five\u2013dimensional conformal domain\n\n7\n\nwith x2 and x3 constant.\nWhen x\u20322 < 0, we can use a Lorentz rotation to rotate the geodesic into\n(x4 , \u03bb) plane. The relevant differential equation:\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nx4 (\u03bb) = (1 \u2212 x4 (\u03bb)2 )/\u03bb\n4\n\nx40 )2\n\n2\n\n(24)\n\n2\n\nsolves to (x (\u03bb) \u2212\n\u2212 \u03bb = a - a hyperbola.\n\u20322\nWhen x > 0, we can Lorentz rotate the geodesic into (x1 , \u03bb) plane, and the\ndifferential equation\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nx1 (\u03bb) = (1 + x1 (\u03bb)2 )/\u03bb\n(25)\nsolves to (x1 (\u03bb) \u2212 x10 )2 + \u03bb2 = a2 - a semi\u2013circle.\n\u039b\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nx1 = x4\n\nFigure 1.

Let Y be in R4,2 with\nY 5 \u2212 Y 6 > 0 and Q(Y ) < 0. Consider the set of all x \u2208 M for which\n(\u03c4+ (x), Y ) = 0. Normalizing Y so that Y 5 \u2212 Y 6 = 1 we can write it in the\n\n\f8\n\nArkadiusz Jadczyk\n\u039b\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nx4\n\nFigure 3.

A simple calculations shows that the\n,\n\u2212\nform Y = y \u03bc , 1\u2212q(y)\u2212\u03bb\n2\n2\n\ncondition (\u03c4+ (x), Y ) = 0 translates then to q(x \u2212 y) = \u2212\u03bb2 . For y = 0 this is\na double-sheeted hyperboloid with apex at x1 = x2 = x3 = 0, x4 = \u00b1\u03bb. Each\ngeodesic line in \u03a3\u2212 can thus be interpreted as a particular one\u2013parameter\nfamily of hyperboloids in Minkowski space.\n3.4. The case of \u03a3+\nThe same method applies as above applies in this case, except that there is\na change of signs in front of \u03bb2 in (12). The resulting metric is then\n1\ndiag (1, 1, 1, \u22121, \u22121),\n(26)\n\u03bb2\nwith signature (3, 2). As in the case of \u03a3\u2212 the conformal infinity is the Cartesian product of R and, this time, the one-sheeted hyperboloid\n(g\u03b1\u03b2 ) =\n\n(X 1 )2 + ... + (X 3 )2 \u2212 (X 4 )2 = 1\nMinkowski space can be embedded in our five\u2013dimensional manifold simply\nby putting \u03bb = 1. It follows that the direction of the vector x\u2032 is constant\nalong geodesics.\nRemark 3.1. Following Wolf [12] we have considered in details only the case\nof the equivalence relation \u2248 . In projective geometry one is using the weaker\nrelation \u223c . The standard projection can be discussed along the same lines as\nabove. In that case the regions X 5 \u2212X 6 > 0 and X 5 \u2212X 6 < 0 are identified, so\n\n\fSTART in a five\u2013dimensional conformal domain\n\n9\n\nwe can restrict our attention to \u03bb > 0.5 On the other hand, when discussing\nthe topology - we have to additionally take the quotient by Z2 .\n3.5. Compactification of the five\u2013dimensional space\nThe manifolds \u03a3\u00b1 , having the topology of S 2 \u00d7 R3 and S 1 \u00d7 R4 , are non\u2013\ncompact. They relate to M\u00f6bius geometry of hyperboloids in Minkowski\nspace. Yet there is an extension of M\u00f6bius geometry - the geometry of Lie\nSpheres, initiated by Sophus Lie [20] and developed by Wilhelm Blaschke\n[21] and Thomas E. Cecil [19]. Using Lie spheres approach we would end up\nwith a projective null cone in a seven\u2013dimensional space that would lead to a\ncompactified version of \u03a3\u00b1 . These compact versions would be equipped with\nO(4, 3) (resp. O(5, 2)) invariant conformal structures. When restricting the\nsymmetry group to O(4, 2) we would then obtain the compactified versions\nof our pseudo\u2013Riemannian five\u2013dimensional manifolds \u03a3\u00b1 . Yet, as of today,\nthis line of research seems to be unfinished.6\n\n4. Predecessor: 5-optics of Yu. B. Rumer\nIn his 2002 paper [6] Jaime Keller gives references to five papers of Albert\nEinstein, seven papers of his own, and two references to Yu. B. Rumer [3,\n4]. In a long series of papers (years 1949\u20131959) Yu. B. Rumer developed a\nfive\u2013dimensional formulation of physics, extending the early ideas of Kaluza,\nKlein, Einstein, Bergmann and Bargmann. Jaime Keller makes in [6] the\nfollowing remarks:\nBesides the many papers which have been written about\nthe Kaluza-Klein proposition and their extension to the idea\nof hyper-space with one additional dimension (at least) for\neach additional interaction included, the direct inclusion of\naction as a fifth dimension was proposed as early as the 19491956 by the Russian physicist Y.B. Rumer [13, 14] under the\nname of \"Action as a spatial coordinate. I\u2013X\". In the work of\nRumer the main foreseen application is to the case of optics\nin what he called 5-optics. We should remember that in this\ncase the action dA = 0 and then the fifth coordinate turns\nout to be identically null.\nWhile the meaning of last part (\"the fifth coordinate turns out to be identically null\") is unclear to the present author, it should be stressed that Rumer\napplied his methods to more than the case of optics - although geometrical\noptics was his starting point. It may be instructive to recall Rumer's own\ncomments on his theory - these comments, from the afterword to his 1956\nmonograph [3] give a historical overview of the involved ideas. Rumer mentions that the formal apparatus of his \"5-optics\" was essentially built in the\n5 That\n\nis why a similar coordinatization is often referred to as \"half\u2013space model\" in the\nliterature on hyperbolic geometry - see e.g. [17].\n6 For a rough justification of such an approach cf. e.g. [22, 23].\n\n\f10\n\nArkadiusz Jadczyk\n\nworks of Theodor Kaluza, Oskar Klein, Vladimir Fock, Albert Einstein and\nPeter Bergmann. Then he gives an historical overview of five\u2013dimensional\ntheories with these remarks:\nI Kaluza (1921) [24]\n1 The extra fifth dimension of the four\u2013dimensional physical space\nof the theory of gravity is introduced. Physical meaning of extra\ndimension remains open.\n2 It is realized that the metric potentials of the 5-space should not\ndepend on the extra fifth coordinate. A physical meaning of this\ncondition remains open.\n3 In order to have a possibility of a one-to-one correspondence between 10+4=14 potentials of the theory of gravity and electrodynamics with 15 metric potentials of the 5\u2013space, an additional condition is being introduced, namely that G55 = 1. Physical meaning\nof this requirement remains open.\nII O. Klein [25] and V. A. Fock (1926) [26]\n1 The relation between 14 potentials of the theory of gravity and\nelectrodynamics, and 15 metric potentials of the 5-space is made\nmore precise. A trajectory of a charged particle is described as a\nnull geodesic line (geometrical ray) in 5-space. In fact one gets an\nequivalence of the problem of relativistic classical mechanics of a\nmotion of a material point with the problem of geometrical optics\nof the ray propagation in 5-space.\n2 It is found that there is a possibility of a formulation of the quantum mechanical problem of the motion of a charged particle as a\nproblem of the wave optics of scalar waves propagation in 5-space,\nnamely if one imposes periodicity condition:\n\u0010 mc\n\u0011\nW (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) = U (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) exp i(\n)x5 ,\n~\nwhile keeping the cylindricity condition for the metric potentials.\n3 The problems of a physical meaning of the fifth coordinate, the\ncylindricity condition for the metric potentials, and periodicity\ncondition for the wave function remain open. The question about\na physical meaning of the condition G55 = 1 remains open\nIII A. Einstein and P. Bergmann (1938) [27] The condition of cylindricity is\nreplaced by a weaker condition of periodicity of metric potentials in the\nfifth coordinate. The period is assumed to be of a microscopic dimension,\nwhich, in a first approximation, can be put equal to zero. In such a case\nthe periodicity condition degenerates into that of cylindricity.\nAs there is no equivalence condition for the electromagnetic field,\nin all these papers the metric tensor of the 5\u2013space depends on the ratio\ne\nm for the particle of which motion is being considered, while the metric\ntensor for the 4\u2013space is a universal one.\nFrom this fact one has to deduce that the 5\u2013space of five\u2013dimensional generalizations of the theory of gravity cannot be (extended by one\n\n\fSTART in a five\u2013dimensional conformal domain\n\n11\n\nextra dimension) a universal physical space of general relativity, but it\nshould have some different physical meaning.\nIV 5-optics\n1 The 5\u2013space of 5\u2013optics is a (extended by one extra dimension)\nconfiguration space for the test particle under consideration. Metric and topological structure of this space reflects the character of\naction of all external matter on the particle.\n2 The fifth coordinate of the configuration space has a clear physical\ncharacter of action. The 5-space is closed in the fifth coordinate.\n3 Instead of the condition of cylindricity for metric potentials and\ncyclicity for the wave function all physical quantities are subjected\nto just one condition of periodicity in the 5-th coordinate.\n4 One finds that the period of the fifth coordinate has a universal\nvalue of Planck's constant, what has a clear physical meaning.\n5 Quantization of action of a material point is an effect of a periodical\ndependence of physical quantities on the action coordinate.\n6 The possibility of assuming G55 = 1 in the previous theories is\nconditioned by the fact that the 5-eiconal equation\n\u2202\u03a3 \u2202\u03a3\n= 0,\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202x\u03bd\nwhich formulates the classical mechanical problem of motion of a\ncharged material point, is homogeneous in metric potentials G\u03bc\u03bd .\nTherefore, in this problem, only fourteen relations between metric\npotentials have a physical meaning, and the condition G55 = 1\ndoes not lead to a contradiction.\n7 A different situation arises in the problem of defining metric potentials from given external sources of the field, which is formulated\nthrough Einstein's equations for 5\u2013space:\n1\nP\u03bb\u03bc \u2212 G\u03bb\u03bc P = \u03ba Q\u03bb\u03bc .\n2\nwhich are inhomogeneous in metric potentials.\ne\n, that enters the expression\nWhen solving this problem the ratio m\nfor the metric\ntensor\nfor\n5-space,\nshould\nbe replaced by a universal\np\u03ba\n. The value of the potential G55 should then be\nquantity c2 2\u03c0\nderived from field equations. One should not put G55 = 1 from\nthe beginning, as this leads, for instance, to wrong results in the\nproblem of a charged point mass.\n8 Taking into account the periodical dependence of the electromagnetic field from the fifth coordinate leads automatically not only\nto long range Coulomb\u2013type forces, but also to short\u2013range forces\nof Yukawa's type.\n9 In all resulting classical theory we are obliged to take ~ \u2192 0, i.e.\nwe should neglect the periodical dependence of physical quantities on the action coordinate. In all resulting quantum theory we\nare obliged to take into account periodical dependence of physical\nG\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\f12\n\nArkadiusz Jadczyk\n\nquantities on the action coordinate. Therefore, from the point of\nview 5\u2013optics, it is inappropriate to neglect, as it is in classical\nmechanics, the periodical dependence of the components of the\nexternal field on the action coordinate.\nTaking into account this dependence should lead to a prediction\nand discovery of a number of 5-optics effects, which could be then\nused for an experimental verification of the theory.\nIn Rumer's autobiographical notes [28] he mentions that his theory of\n1956 was predicting spin 3/2 for the electron - three times too much. This fact\nhas discouraged Freeman Dyson who, for some time, was following all developments of Rumer's theory. It is only in 1959, with the help of V. Pokrovsky,\nRumer was able to find a solution to this puzzle [4].\n\nAcknowledgment\nThanks are due to Pierre Angl\u00e8s for his interest, comments and encouragement, and to Rafal Ablamowicz for his supervision and help in the editorial\nissues.
