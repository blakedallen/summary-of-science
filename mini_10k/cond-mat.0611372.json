In mesoscopic transport experiments, decoherence (also called dephasing) is responsible for\nthe nontrivial temperature- and voltage-dependence of the electrical conductance in disordered samples\n(displaying weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations) and solid-state electron interferometers.\nThe most important paradigmatic quantum-dissipative models (\"Caldeira-Leggett\" [1, 2] and \"spinboson\" [3, 4]) and many well-known techniques used for describing decoherence assume the environment\nto be a bath of harmonic oscillators, where the fluctuations obey Gaussian statistics. This assumption is\ncorrect for some cases (e.g. photons and phonons), and generally represents a very good approximation for\nthe combined contribution of many weakly coupled fluctuators, due to the central limit theorem. However,\nultrasmall structures may couple only to a few fluctuators (spins, charged defects etc.), thus requiring models\nof dephasing by non-Gaussian noise. Such models are becoming very important right now in the context of\nquantum information processing [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\nMoreover, the quantum measurement process itself is accompanied by unavoidable fluctuations which\ndephase the quantum system [15, 16, 17], while dephasing itself can conversely be viewed as a kind of detection\nprocess [18, 19]. Therefore, \"controlled dephasing\" experiments can be used to study the transition from\nquantum to classical behavior, e.g. by coupling an electron interferometer to a tunable \"which path detector\"\n[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], which produces shot noise by partitioning an electron stream [26, 27, 28, 29, 30].\nIn previous mesoscopic controlled dephasing experiments the coupling between detector and interferometer\n1\n\n\fT\n\nh\u03c3\u0302x(t)i\n\n1\n\neV\ndetector channel\n\n0.5\n\nv(t)\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n(b)\n\ncharge qubit\n\n-1\n\n(d)\n\ndetector channel\n\nvdett\n\nw(x)\nMach\u2212Zehnder\ninterferometer\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\nt\n\ng\n\nu(x)\n\n\u03c3\n\nFigure 1: Schematic drawing of the models considered in the text: A detector channel with shot noise coupled\nto (a) an interferometer channel or (b) a charge qubit.

In this schematic example, the visibility itself oscillates - this is impossible in models of Gaussian\nnoise but a direct feature of the non-Gaussian nature of the shot noise, in the strong coupling regime g > \u03c0\n(see text and following figures).\nwas weak, requiring the passage of many detector electrons in order to determine the path. Under these\nconditions, the phase of the interfering electron fluctuates according to a Gaussian random process.\nRecently, a controlled dephasing experiment was performed [31, 32] using an electronic Mach-Zehnder\nInterferometer (MZI) [33, 34] coupled to a nearby partitioned edge-channel serving as a detector. Its results\ndiffered substantially from those of earlier controlled-dephasing experiments. The interference contrast of\nthe Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, quantified by the visibility v = (Imax \u2212 Imin )/(Imax + Imin ), revealed two\nunexpected effects:\n(a) The visibility as a function of the detector transmission probability T changes from the expected\nsmooth parabolic suppression \u221d T (1 \u2212 T ) at low detector voltages to a sharp \"V-shape\" behaviour at some\nlarger voltages.\n(b) The visibility drops to zero at intermediate voltages, then reappears again as V increases, and vanishes\nat even larger voltages, thus displaying oscillations.\nAs estimated in [31], three (or even fewer) detecting electrons suffice to quench the visibility. For this\nreason, one suspects that these effects may be a signature of the strong coupling between interferometer\nand detector. Indeed, that coupling has already been exploited to entangle the interfering electrons with the\ndetector electrons, and afterwards recover the phase information by cross-correlating the current fluctuations\nof the MZI and the detector [31], even after it has completely vanished in conductance measurements. The\ndephasing in the MZI system is caused by the detector's shot noise, which is known to obey binomial,\ni.e. non-Gaussian, statistics. Thus, earlier theoretical discussions of dephasing in the electronic MachZehnder interferometer, based on a Gaussian environment [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], are no longer sufficient\n(see [41, 42] for a discussion of Luttinger liquid physics in an MZI). At the same time, a nonperturbative\ntreatment is required, to capture the non-Gaussian effects. Higher moments of the noise become important,\nand dephasing starts to depend on the full counting statistics, which itself represents a topic attracting\nconsiderable attention nowadays [43, 39, 44]. The relation between full counting statistics, detection and\ndephasing has been explored recently by Averin and Sukhorukov [44]. There, the dephasing rate and the\nmeasurement rate were considered, i.e. the focus was placed on the long-time limit, similarly to other\ncalculations of dephasing by non-Gaussian noise [5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14]. In contrast, we will emphasize the\n2\n\n\fsurprising evolution of the visibility at short to intermediate times.\nThe main purpose of this paper then is to present a nonperturbative treatment of a theoretical model\nthat explains the new experimental results, and provides quantitative predictions for the behavior of the\nvisibility as a function of detector bias and partitioning. Furthermore, we will show how the approximate\nsolution for the MZI is directly related to an exact solution for the pure dephasing of a charge qubit by shot\nnoise, where the time evolution of the visibility parallels the evolution with detector voltage. In conclusion,\nit will emerge that the novel features observed in [32], and the results derived here, are in fact fundamental\nand generic consequences of dephasing by the non-Gaussian shot noise of a strongly coupled electron system.\nAs a side effect, this may indicate a solution to the puzzling observation of visibility oscillations in a MZI\nwithout adjacent detector channel [34].\nThe paper is organized as follows: We first describe dephasing of a charge qubit, being the simpler\nmodel that can be solved exactly. After introducing the model in section 2.1, we derive the exact solution\n(2.2). We briefly discuss the relation to full counting statistics (2.3), and provide formulas obtained in the\nwell-known Gaussian approximation (2.4, 2.5) for comparison, before presenting and discussing the results\nobtained from a numerical evaluation of the exact expression (section 2.6). In section 3, we then go on\nto introduce a certain approximation that keeps only the nonequilibrium part of the noise and allows an\nanalytical discussion of many features, some of which become particularly transparent in the wave packet\npicture of shot noise (3.2). In section 4 we briefly contrast the features of our solution with those of the wellknown model describing dephasing by classical random telegraph noise. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer\nis then described in section 5, by first solving exactly the problem of a single electron interacting with the\ndetector (5.1), and then introducing the Pauli principle (5.2). The results are discussed (5.3) and compared\nagainst the experimental data (5.4). Finally, we briefly indicate (5.5) a possible solution to the puzzling\nvisibility oscillations observed in the MZI without detector channel.\nOur main results are: the exact formula for the time-evolution of the visibility of the charge qubit given\nin equation (19), and the formula for the effect of the nonequilibrium part of the noise on the visibility\nof qubit (37) or interferometer (65). Their most important general analytical consequences are derived in\nsection 3.1, including a detailed discussion of the visibility oscillations.\n\n2\n\nCharge qubit subject to non-Gaussian shot noise\n\nInterferometers may be used as highly sensitive detectors, by coupling them to a quantum system and reading\nout the induced phase shift. Here we focus on a setup like the one that has been realized in [23], where\na double dot (\"charge qubit\") has been subject to the shot noise of a partitioned one-dimensional electron\nchannel. However, we note that the strong-coupling regime to be discussed below yet remains to be achieved\nin such an experiment.\n\n2.1\n\nModel\n\nWe consider a charge qubit with two charge states \u03c3\u0302z = \u00b11. It is coupled to the density fluctuations of\nnon-interacting \"detector\" fermions\n\u0124 = \u0124qb + \u0124int + \u0124det ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u0124qb = 2\u01eb \u03c3\u0302z ,\n\u0124det =\n\nX\n\n\u01ebk d\u02c6\u2020k d\u02c6k ,\n\n(2)\n\nk\n\nand\n\n\u03c3\u0302z + 1\nV\u0302 .\n2\nThis coupling is of the diagonal form, i.e. it commutes with the qubit Hamiltonian, thereby leading\nto pure dephasing and not to energy relaxation (the populations of the qubit levels are preserved).\nderivation of the exact expressions to be analyzed below depends crucially on this type of coupling.\n\u0124int =\n\n3\n\n(3)\nonly\nThe\nThe\n\n\ffluctuating quantum noise potential V\u0302 introduced in (3) is related to the density of detector particles in the\nvicinity of the qubit, see figure 1:\nZ\nX\nV\u0302 = dx u(x)\u03c1\u0302det (x) =\n(4)\nuk\u2032 k d\u02c6\u2020k\u2032 d\u02c6k\nk\u2032 ,k\n\nHere u(x) is the arbitrary interaction potential (whose details in a realistic situation will be determined\nby the screening properties of the environment), \u03c1\u0302det (x) = \u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x)\u03c8\u0302(x) is the detector density, and \u03c8\u0302(x) =\nP\n\u02c6\nk \u03c6k (x)dk is the expansion in terms of the single-particle eigenstates of the detector. At this point we\ndo not yet specify the nature of the detector, as some of the following formulas are valid in general for any\nnon-interacting fermion system. However, ultimately the evaluations will be performed for a one-dimensional\nchannel of fermions moving chirally at constant speed, representing our model of a \"detector edge channel\".\nThis was implemented in the integer Quantum Hall Effect two-dimensional electron gas [23, 31, 32] and can\npresumably be realized in other one-dimensional electron systems as well (e.g. electrons moving inside a\ncarbon nanotube).\nWe are interested in describing the outcome of the following standard type of experiment in quantum\ncoherent dynamics: Suppose we prepare the qubit in a superposition state of |\u2191i and |\u2193i at time t = 0, and\nthen switch on the interaction with the detector electrons. In effect this can be realized by applying a Rabi\n\u03c0/2 pulse to the qubit that is initially in the state |\u2193i. During the following time-evolution, the off-diagonal\nelement \u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t) will be affected by the coupling to the bath, experiencing decoherence. Its original oscillatory\ntime-evolution is multiplied by a factor, that can be written as the overlap D(t) = h\u03c7\u2193 (t)|\u03c7\u2191 (t)i of the two\ndetector states \u03c7\u2193 (t) and \u03c7\u2191 (t) that evolve under the action of \u0124det and \u0124det + V\u0302 , respectively. In this way,\nthe relation between decoherence and measurement becomes evident [18]:\nE\nD\n(5)\nD(t) = e+i\u0124det t e\u2212i(\u0124det +V\u0302 )t .\nNote that we have set ~ \u2261 1. This can also be written as\nD(t) =\n\n\u001c\n\u001d\nZ t\ndt\u2032 V\u0302 (t\u2032 )) ,\nT\u0302 exp(\u2212i\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nwhere V\u0302 (t\u2032 ) is the fluctuating quantum noise operator in the Heisenberg picture with respect to \u0124det , and\nT\u0302 is the time-ordering symbol. The magnitude of this time-dependent \"coherence factor\" defines what we\nwill call the \"visibility\"\nv = |D(t)|.\n\n(7)\n\nThe visibility (with 0 \u2264 v \u2264 1) determines the suppression of the oscillations in any observable that is\nsensitive to the coherence between the two levels, e.g. h\u03c3\u0302x (t)i = Re\u03c1\u2191\u2193 (t). This is depicted in figure 1 (d).\n\n2.2\n\nTime-evolution of the visibility: General expressions\n\nThe average in the coherence factor D(t) displayed in equation (5) is taken with respect to the unperturbed\nstate of the detector electrons, which may refer to a nonequilibrium situation. We will assume that this\ninitial state can be described by independently fluctuating occupations d\u02c6\u2020k d\u02c6k of the single-particle states k.\nThis assumption covers all the cases of interest to us, namely the equilibrium noise at arbitrary temperature,\nas well as shot noise produced by transmission of particles through a partially reflecting barrier, leading to\na nonequilibrium Fermi distribution.\nThe average (5) can be evaluated in a variety of ways, e.g. using the linked cluster expansion applied to\na time-ordered exponential. However, here we make use of a convenient formula derived by Klich [45] in the\nP\ncontext of full counting statistics. Denoting as \u0393(A) \u2261 k\u2032 ,k Ak\u2032 k d\u02c6\u2020k\u2032 d\u02c6k the second-quantized single-particle\noperator built from the transition matrix elements Ak\u2032 k , we have [45] (for fermions)\ntr[e\u0393(A) e\u0393(B) ] = det[1 + e\u00c2 eB\u0302 ],\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere \u00c2 is the operator acting in the single-particle Hilbert space. In general, this formula allows us to\nobtain the average of the exponential of any single-electron operator with respect to a many-particle density\nmatrix that does not contain correlations. Indeed, for a state with independently fluctuating occupations, we\ncan write the many-body density matrix in an exponential form that is suitable for application of equation\n(8):\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n=\n\n\u03a0k [nk d\u02c6\u2020k d\u02c6k + (1 \u2212 nk )(1 \u2212 d\u02c6\u2020k d\u02c6k )]\n\u03a0k (1 \u2212 nk )e\n\nP\n\nnk\n\u02c6\u2020 \u02c6\nk dk dk ln 1\u2212n\n\nk\n\n(9)\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 nk \u2264 1 is the probability of state k being occupied (formally it is necessary to consider the limits\nnk \u2192 0 and nk \u2192 1 if needed). Inserting this expression into (8), and defining the occupation number matrix\nnk\u2032 k = \u03b4k\u2032 k nk , we are now able to evaluate averages of the form\ntr[ei\n\nP\n\nk\u2032 ,k\n\nAk\u2032 k d\u0302\u2020k\u2032 d\u0302k\n\n\u03c1\u0302] = (\u03a0k (1 \u2212 nk )) det[1 + ei\u00c2\n= det[1 + (ei\u00c2 \u2212 1)n\u0302].\n\nn\u0302\n]\n1 \u2212 n\u0302\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nThe average (5) then can be performed by identifying the product of time-evolution operators as a single\nunitary operator, of the form given here. Thus, we find\nD(t) = det[1 + (\u015c(t) \u2212 1)n\u0302],\n\n(13)\n\n\u015c(t) = ei\u0125det t e\u2212i(\u0125det +\u00fb)t .\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the finite-time scattering matrix (interaction picture evolution operator) is\n\nHere \u00fb is the interaction from (4), and \u0125det is the single-particle Hamiltonian of the detector electrons\nthat is diagonal in the k-basis: [hdet ]k\u2032 k = \u01ebk \u03b4k\u2032 k . In principle, equation (13) allows us to evaluate the\ntime-evolution of the coherence factor for coupling to an arbitrary noninteracting fermion system.\nIn practice, this involves calculating the time-dependent scattering of arbitrary incoming k-states from\nthe coupling potential u(x), i.e. determining the action of the scattering matrix. Note that in the case of\nfully occupied states (nk \u2261 1 for all k), the operator n\u0302 becomes the identity and the determinant reduces to\nthe product of scattering phase factors that can be obtained by diagonalizing the scattering matrix. More\ngenerally, the contributions to D(t) from states deep inside the Fermi sea always only amount to a phase\nfactor, which will drop out when considering the visibility v = |D(t)|.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we will focus on the specific, and experimentally relevant, case of a onedimensional channel of fermions moving at constant speed vdet (i.e. using a linearized dispersion relation).\nWe will employ plane wave states inside a normalization volume L and first assume a finite bandwidth\nk \u2208 [\u2212kc , +kc ]. At the end of the calculation, we will send L and kc to infinity (see below).\nThe equation of motion for a detector single-particle wave function \u03c8(x, t) in the presence of the potential\nu(x) is\ni(\u2202t + vdet \u2202x )\u03c8(x, t) = u(x)\u03c8(x, t),\n\n(15)\n\nwhich is solved by\n\u03c8(x, t) = exp[\u2212i\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032 u(x \u2212 vdet t\u2032 )]\u03c8(x \u2212 vdet t, 0).\n\n(16)\n\nThis corresponds to the action of exp(\u2212i(\u0125det + \u00fb)t) on the initial wave function. Applying exp(i\u0125det t)\nafterwards, we end up with the same expression, but with \u03c8(x, 0) on the right-hand-side (rhs). In other\nwords, the action of the scattering matrix is to multiply the wave function by a position-dependent phase\nfactor:\ni\nh\n\u015c(t)\u03c8 (x) = e\u2212iw(x) \u03c8(x),\n(17)\n5\n\n\fwhere the phase function w(x) is related to the interaction potential, as seen above:\nZ t\nw(x) =\ndt\u2032 u(x \u2212 vdet t\u2032 ).\n\n(18)\n\n0\n\nThe phase function is depicted in figure 1 (c). Two remarks regarding the finite band-cutoff kc are in order\nat this point: As argued above, states deep inside the Fermi sea only contribute a phase factor to D(t). This\nis the reason we obtain a converging result for the visibility v = |D(t)| when taking the limit kc \u2192 \u221e in\nthe end, whereas D(t) itself acquires a phase that grows linearly with kc . Moreover, strictly speaking the\nrelation (17) only holds for states \u03c8(x) that are not composed of k-states at the boundaries of the interval\nk \u2208 [\u2212kc , +kc ], since otherwise the multiplication by e\u2212iw(x) will yield contributions that are cut off as they\nfall outside the range of allowed wavenumbers. Nevertheless, for the purpose of calculating the visibility, this\ndiscrepancy between the operators \u015c(t) and eiw(x) will not matter, as those states only contribute phases to\nD(t) anyway. Thus, we are indeed allowed to write the visibility as\nv(t) = det[1 + (\u015c(t) \u2212 1)n\u0302] = det[1 + (e\u2212i\u0175(t) \u2212 1)n\u0302] .\n\n(19)\n\nThis is the central formula that will be the basis for all our discussions below.\nWe briefly discuss some general properties of the phase function w(x) and its Fourier transform. The\nmatrix elements of \u0175 are given by the Fourier transform wk\u2032 k = L1 w\u0303(q = k \u2032 \u2212 k) of w(x). Thus, they are\nconnected to those of the interaction potential u(x) via\nZ\neiqvdet t \u2212 1\nw\u0303(q) = dx e\u2212iqx w(x) =\n\u0169(q),\n(20)\niqvdet\nR\nwhere \u0169(q) = dxe\u2212iqx u(x).\nAt times vdet t \u226b \u03c3, the phase function w(x) has the generic form of a box with corners rounded on the\nscale \u03c3 of the interaction potential, see figure 1 (c). The phase fluctuations are then due to the fluctuations\nof the number of electrons inside the interval of length vdet t. The most important parameter in this regard\nis the height of w(x) inside the interval. This defines the dimensionless coupling strength g, given by\nZ +\u221e\nw\u0303(q = 0)\n1\ng\u2261\n=\ndy u(y).\n(21)\nvdet t\nvdet \u2212\u221e\nThe coupling strength determines the contribution of a single electron to the phase (in a regime where we are\nallowed to treat that single electron simply as a delta peak in the density). We will see that all the results\ncan be expressed in terms of the dimensionless quantities g, eV t, V \u03c3/vdet , and the occupation probability T\nof states inside the voltage window (as well as the temperature, T \u03c3/vdet , for finite temperature situations).\n\n2.3\n\nRelation to full counting statistics\n\nIn the context of full counting statistics (FCS) [43], one is interested in obtaining the entire probability\ndistribution of a fluctuating number N of particles, e.g. the number of electrons transmitted through a\ncertain wire cross section during a given time interval, or the number of particles contained within a certain\nvolume. Usually, it is most convenient to deal with the generating function\nX\n\u03c7(\u03bb) =\nPN ei\u03bbN .\n(22)\nN\n\nThe decoherence function D(t), and thus the visibility v = |D(t)|, are directly related to a suitably defined\ngenerating function.R In the limit \u03c3 \u2192 0, the phase function w(x) becomes a box of height g on the interval\nx \u2208 [0, vdet t]. Then dx w(x)\u03c1\u0302(x) is g N\u0302 , where N\u0302 is the number of electrons within the box. Thus we find\nfor the visibility\nv = |\u03c7(g)|,\n\n(23)\n\nin terms of the generating function \u03c7 for the probability distribution of particles N . For a finite range \u03c3 of\nthe interaction potential, we are dealing with a fluctuating quantity that no longer just takes discrete values.\n6\n\n\fWe emphasize, however, that our main focus is different from the typical applications of FCS, where one\nis usually interested in the long-time limit and consequently discusses the remaining small deviations from\npurely Gaussian statistics. The long-time behaviour of decoherence by a detecting quantum point contact\nhas been discussed in [44], where formulas similar to (19) appeared. In contrast, we are interested in the\nvisibility oscillations as a most remarkable feature of the behaviour at short to intermediate times. In other\nwords, the kinds of setups discussed here in principle offer an experimental way of accessing such short-time\nfeatures of FCS, which are otherwise not detectable.\n\n2.4\n\nGaussian approximation\n\nBefore going on to discuss the visibility arising from the exact expression (19), we derive the Gaussian\napproximation to the visibility. We will first do so in a general way and later point out that the same\nresult could be obtained starting from equation (19). If V\u0302 were a linear superposition of harmonic oscillator\ncoordinates, and these oscillators were in thermal equilibrium, then its noise would be Gaussian (i.e. it would\ncorrespond to a Gaussian random process in the classical limit). This kind of quantum noise, arising from\na harmonic oscillator bath, is the one studied most of the time in the field of quantum dissipative systems\n(e.g. in the context of the Caldeira-Leggett model or the spin-boson model). In that case, the following\nexpression would be exact. In contrast, our present model in general displays non-Gaussian noise, being due\nto the density fluctuations of a system of discrete charges. Thus, the following formula constitutes what we\nwill call the \"Gaussian approximation\", against which we will compare the results of our model:\n\u0014 D E\nZ\nZ t\nD\nE\u0015\n1 t\ndt1\n(24)\nDGauss (t) = exp \u2212i V\u0302 t \u2212\ndt2 T\u0302 \u03b4 V\u0302 (t1 )\u03b4 V\u0302 (t2 ) .\n2 0\n0\nD E\nHere \u03b4 V\u0302 \u2261 V\u0302 \u2212 V\u0302 . If we are only interested in the decay of the visibility, we obtain\n\u0014\nZ\nZ t\noE\u0015\n1 t\n1 Dn\n\u03b4 V\u0302 (t1 ), \u03b4 V\u0302 (t2 )\n,\n(25)\ndt1\nvGauss (t) = |DGauss (t)| = exp \u2212\ndt2\n2 0\n2\n0\ni.e. the decay only depends on the symmetrized quantum correlator. Introducing the quantum noise spectrum\nZ\nD\nE\nD\nE\n= dt ei\u03c9t \u03b4 V\u0302 (t)\u03b4 V\u0302 (0) ,\n(26)\n\u03b4 V\u0302 \u03b4 V\u0302\n\u03c9\n\nwe find the well-known expression\n\nln vGauss (t) = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nE 2 sin2 ( \u03c9t )\nd\u03c9 D\n2\n\u03b4 V\u0302 \u03b4 V\u0302\n.\n2\u03c0\n\u03c92\n\u03c9\n\n(27)\n\nThis result is valid for an arbitrary noise correlator. Inserting the relation between V\u0302 and the density\nfluctuations (4), we have\nD\nE\nX\n\u03b4 V\u0302 \u03b4 V\u0302\n= 2\u03c0\n(28)\n|uk\u2032 k |2 nk (1 \u2212 nk\u2032 )\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 (\u01ebk\u2032 \u2212 \u01ebk ))\n\u03c9\n\nk\u2032 ,k\n\nfor the spectrum. In the following, we specialize to the case of one-dimensional fermions moving at constant\nspeed (\u01ebk = vdet k). Then we find:\nlnvGauss (t) = \u2212\n\n1X\n|wk\u2032 k (t)|2 nk (1 \u2212 nk\u2032 ),\n2 \u2032\n\n(29)\n\nk ,k\n\nwhere the matrix \u0175 corresponds to the potential u(x \u2212 vdet t\u2032 ) integrated over the interaction time, see\nequations (18) and (20). We could have arrived at this formula equally well by using (19) to write\nv = exp[Re tr ln(1 + (e\u2212i\u0175 \u2212 1)n\u0302)],\n\n(30)\n\nand expanding the exponent to second order in \u0175. Equation (29) will be used for comparison against the\nfull results obtained from (19) numerically below.\n7\n\n\f2.5\n\nResults for the visibility according to the Gaussian approximation\n\nWe now discuss the results of the Gaussian approximation for certain special cases. For definiteness, here\nand in the following, we will assume an interaction potential u(x) of width \u03c3, which we will take to be of\nGaussian form wherever the precise shape is needed:\n2\n2\nu0\nu(x) = \u221a e\u2212(x/\u03c3) , \u0169(q) = u0 e\u2212(q\u03c3/2) .\n\u03c0\u03c3\n\n(31)\n\nOther smoothly decaying functions do not yield results that deviate appreciably in any qualitatively important way. The coupling strength (21) then becomes\ng=\n\nu0\n.\nvdet\n\n(32)\n\nAt zero temperature, in equilibrium, the evolution of the visibility is determined by the well-known physics of\nthe orthogonality catastrophe, which underlies many important phenomena such as the X-ray edge singularity\nor the Kondo effect [46]: After coupling the two-level system to the fermionic bath, the two states |\u03c7\u2191 i and\n|\u03c7\u2193 i evolve such that their overlap decays as a power-law. The long-time limit of a vanishing overlap is\nproduced by the fact that the ground states of a fermion system with and without an arbitrarily weak\nscattering potential are orthogonal. The exponent can be obtained from the coupling strength g. We find,\nfrom (29) and (20),\nT =V =0\nvGauss\n(t)\n\n= const *\n\n\u0012\n\nvdet t\n\u03c3\n\ng 2\n\u0013\u2212( 2\u03c0\n)\n\n(33)\n\nin the long-time limit. Only the prefactor depends on the precise shape of the interaction u(x). We note that\nthe result diverges for \u03c3 \u2192 0. The reason is that a finite 1/\u03c3 is needed as an effective momentum cutoff up\nto which fluctuations of the density in the Fermi sea are taken into account. In any physical realization the\nfluctuations will be finite, since then the density of electrons is finite and there is a physical cutoff besides\n1/\u03c3.\nAfter applying a finite bias voltage, the occupation inside the voltage window is determined by the\ntransmission probability T of a barrier (quantum point contact) through which the stream of electrons has\nbeen sent: nk = T for vdet k \u2208 [0, eV ]. Then, equation (29) yields two contributions, one of which is the\nequilibrium contribution we have just calculated. As a result, the visibility factorizes into the zero voltage\ncontribution and the extra suppression resulting from the second moment of the shot noise:\nT =0,V 6=0\nvGauss\n(t)\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0010 g \u00112\nF\n(eV\nt)\n=\nexp\n\u2212T\n(1\n\u2212\nT\n)\nT =0,V =0\n2\u03c0\nvGauss\n(t)\n\n(34)\n\nThe function F (eV t) is given by\nF (eV t) =\n\n(\n\n(eV t)2\n2\n\n(eV t \u226a 1 and eV \u03c3/vdet \u226a 1)\n\u03c0eV t (eV t \u226b 1, \u03c3 = 0)\n\n(35)\n\nHere the low-voltage (short-time) quadratic rise is independent of the shape of the interaction potential u:\nOnly low frequency (long wavelength) fluctuations of the density are important, and thus only the coupling\nconstant g enters, being an integral over u(x), see (21). At large voltages there is, in general, an extra constant\nprefactor in front of F that depends on \u03c3 and the shape of u. However, in contrast to the equilibrium part\nof the visibility (33), the limit \u03c3 \u2192 0 is finite, and we have evaluated this limit in the second line of (35).\nFinally, it is interesting to note that for the present model the fermionic density can be expressed as\na sum over normal mode oscillators (plasmons) after bosonization. Thus, in equilibrium, the Gaussian\napproximation is actually exact. However, once the system is driven out of equilibrium by a finite bias voltage\nand displays shot noise, the many-body state is a highly correlated non-Gaussian state, when expressed in\nterms of the plasmons, even though it looks simple with respect to the fermion basis, where the occupations\nof different k-states fluctuate independently.\n8\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n0.1\n\nVisibility v\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\n10\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\ng=0.5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n0.6\n\nVisibility v\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nTime vdett/\u03c3\n\n15\n\n0\n\n20\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nTime vdett/\u03c3\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 2: Time-evolution of the visibility (coherence) v = |D(t)| of a qubit coupled to quantum noise from\na non-interacting 1D electron channel, at zero temperature, after switching on the interaction at t = 0. The\ncurves have been obtained by direct numerical evaluation of (19). Left : Decoherence by equilibrium noise,\nfor increasing coupling strength g (top to bottom curve), displaying the power-law decay (33) expected from\nthe physics of the orthogonality catastrophe (inset: log-log plot, with dashed lines indicating the expected\nexponents (g/2\u03c0)2 ). Right : Decoherence by shot-noise (at a finite voltage eV \u03c3/vdet = 1). Beyond g = \u03c0,\nthe visibility displays a periodic pattern, with zeroes and coherence revivals, as a result of the non-Gaussian\nnature of the noise. Dashed lines indicate the Gaussian approximation. The transmission probability of the\nbarrier generating the shot noise equals T = 1/2.\n\n2.6\n\nExact numerical results for the visibility and discussion\n\nIn the following, we plot and discuss the results of a direct numerical evaluation of the determinant (19)\nthat yields the exact time-evolution of the visibility of a charge qubit subject to shot noise. We focus on the\nzero temperature case, although the formula also allows us to treat thermal fluctuations which lead to an\nadditional suppression of visibility. The most important parameters are the dimensionless coupling constant\ng (21), the transmission probability T , and the voltage V applied to the detector channel. We will also note\nwhenever the results depend on the width \u03c3 or shape of the interaction potential u(x).\nIn figure 2, we have displayed the time-evolution of the visibility v = |D(t)| as a function of vdet t/\u03c3, for\ndifferent couplings. In equilibrium, the curves derived from the full expression (19) coincide exactly with\nthose obtained from the Gaussian theory (29), as expected. The long-time behaviour is given by the powerlaw decay (33) arising from the orthogonality catastrophe. However, at finite voltages, with extra dephasing\ndue to shot noise, the Gaussian approximation fails: In general, it tends to overestimate the visibility at\nlonger times and larger couplings (dashed lines in figure 2, right). The most prominent non-Gaussian feature\nsets in after the coupling g crosses a threshold that is equal to g = \u03c0, as will be explained below: For larger\ng, the visibility displays oscillations, vanishing at certain times (for a barrier with T = 1/2) and showing\n\"coherence revivals\" in-between these zeroes. The zeroes coincide with phase jumps of \u03c0 in D(t) (see figure\n4). We will discuss the locations of these zeroes in more detail below.\nSuch a behaviour of the visibility can only be explained by invoking non-Gaussian noise. In every Gaussian\n2\ntheory, we can employ ei\u03c6 = e\u2212h\u03c6 i/2 \u2265 0, which directly excludes the behaviour found here (regardless of\nnoise spectrum and coupling strength), even though it is still compatible with a non-monotonous evolution\nof the visibility. The simplest available model of dephasing by non-Gaussian noise will compared with the\npresent results in section 4.\nIn order to obtain insight into the general structure of the solution, we first of all note that the qualitative\n9\n\n\f10\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n\n0.6\n5\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\nVisibility v\n\nCoupling g\n\n0.7\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nTime eVt\nFigure 3: Evolution of the visibility (density plot) as a function of coupling constant g (vertical) and time\neV t (horizontal).

This is the reason why,\nin the following, we will plot the time-evolution as a function of eV t (instead of vdet t/\u03c3), which is the relevant\nvariable.\nIn figure 3, we display the time-evolution versus the coupling g. The threshold at g = \u03c0 is clearly noted.\nFurthermore, the first zero occurs at a time t1 = 2\u03c0 2 /(eV g) which shrinks with increasing coupling (provided\ng \u226b 1, see discussion in the next section and equation (42)). In contrast, subsequent zeroes have a periodic\nspacing that appears to be roughly independent of g, given approximately by \u03b4(eV t) = 2\u03c0 for the small\nvalues of g plotted here.\nFinally, in figure 4, the effects of the transmission probability T on the evolution of the visibility and\nthe full coherence factor D(t) have been plotted, indicating the phase jumps obtained at T = 1/2 whenever\nv = |D(t)| vanishes.\nAll of these features will now be analyzed further by restricting the discussion to the effects of the\nnonequilibrium part of the noise.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nNonequilibrium part of the noise\nGeneral properties\n\nWithin the Gaussian approximation, we noted that the visibility at finite voltages factorized into one factor\ndescribing the decay due to equilibrium noise and another part describing the effect of nonequilibrium shot\nnoise (34). More precisely, the nonequilibrium part of the visibility can be calculated from (29) by simply\nrestricting the matrix elements of wk\u2032 k to transitions within the voltage window: k, k \u2032 \u2208 [0, eV /vdet ]. This\nhas\nD theEphysical interpretation that only these transitions contibute to the excess noise in the spectrum\n\u03b4 V\u0302 \u03b4 V\u0302\nof the fluctuating potential. In addition, since the equilibrium noise comes out exact in the\n\u03c9\nGaussian theory, we can state that all the non-Gaussian features are due to the nonequilibrium part.\n11\n\n\fBased on these observations, we now introduce a heuristic approximation to the full non-Gaussian theory,\nwhich works surprisingly well. We will factorize\n\n\u2032\n\nv T =0,V 6=0 (t) \u2248 v T =V =0 (t) * v \u2032 (t),\n\n(36)\n\nwhere v is the visibility obtained from the full expression (19) after restricting the matrix elements of \u0175 in\nthe fashion described above. We will denote the restricted matrix as \u0175\u2032 . Note that the restricted matrix\ndepends on the voltage, in contrast to \u0175 itself.\nSince the occupation probability is constant within the voltage window, nk = T , the matrices n\u0302 and \u0175\u2032\nnow commute. This allows a considerable simplification, yielding a visibility that can be written in terms of\nthe eigenvalues \u03c6j of the matrix \u0175\u2032 :\nv \u2032 (t) = \u03a0j |R + T e\u2212i\u03c6j |.\n\n(37)\n\nThus, the dependence on the transmission probability has been separated from the dependence on interaction\npotential, time, and voltage, contained within \u03c6j . The results obtained from the exact formula are compared\nagainst this approximation in figure 5 (a). We observe that all the important qualitative features are retained\nin the approximation. Furthermore, the locations of the zeroes come out quite well, while the amplitude of\nthe oscillations is underestimated.\nWe will now list some general properties of the matrix \u0175\u2032 that determines the visibility according to (37):\n(i) The sum of eigenvalues is\nX\ng\n\u03c6j = tr\u0175\u2032 =\neV t.\n(38)\n2\u03c0\nj\n(ii) For a non-negative (non-positive) phase function w(x), the matrix \u0175\u2032 is positive (negative) semidefinite:\nWe can map any wavefunction |\u03c8i to another state |\u03c8 \u2032 i by setting \u03c8k\u2032 = \u03c8k only inside the voltage window,\nand \u03c8k\u2032 = 0 otherwise. Then\nZ\nh\u03c8 |\u0175\u2032 | \u03c8i = h\u03c8 \u2032 |\u0175| \u03c8 \u2032 i = dx |\u03c8 \u2032 (x)|2 w(x) \u2265 0,\n(39)\nfor a non-negative function w(x), and analogously for a non-positive function w(x).\n(iii) Following the same argument, we can prove that the largest eigenvalue of \u0175\u2032 is bounded by the maximum\nof w(x), if maxw(x) \u2265 0:\nZ\nh\u03c8 |\u0175\u2032 | \u03c8i = dx |\u03c8 \u2032 (x)|2 w(x) \u2264 h\u03c8 \u2032 |\u03c8 \u2032 i maxw(x) \u2264 maxw(x).\n(40)\n\nAnalogously the smallest eigenvalue is bounded from below by the minimum (if maxw(x) \u2264 0).\nAt small voltages (short times) (where eV t \u226a 1 and eV \u03c3/vdet \u226a 1), the matrix elements are constant\ninside the voltage window, wk\u2032 \u2032 k = L1 w\u0303(q = 0), yielding only one nonvanishing eigenvalue, given by (38):\n\ng\neV t .\n(41)\n2\u03c0\nAs a consequence, at sufficiently large g \u226b 1, the first zero in the visibility v \u2032 (t) will occur when \u03c61 = \u03c0,\nimplying\n\u03c61 =\n\nt1 =\n\n2\u03c0 2\n.\ngeV\n\n(42)\n\nAssuming now that w(x) is non-negative (as is the case in our example, if g > 0), we can immediately deduce\nthe following general consequences from properties (i) to (iii): All of them taken together imply that the rise\nof the first eigenvalue must saturate below maxw(x) (which approaches g for times vdet t \u226b \u03c3). Thus, other\neigenvalues must start to grow, in order to obey the sum-rule. If (and only if) the coupling constant is large\nenough, this may lead to an infinite series of zeroes in the visibility (see below). Therefore, we are dealing\nwith a true strong coupling effect.\nWe have not found an analytical way of obtaining \u03c6j at arbitrary parameters. However, all relevant features follow from the foregoing discussion and may be illustrated by numerical evaluation of the eigenvalues.\n12\n\n\f30\n\nTransmission\nprobability\n\n1\n25\n\neigenvalue \u03c6j/g\n\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\nVisibility v'\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nj=1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0.4\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n0\n\ncoupling g\n\n1\n\n5\n\n\u03c0\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nTime eVt\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nTime eVt\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nTime eVt\n\nFigure 5: Left : Contribution v \u2032 of the nonequilibrium part of the noise (i.e. the shot noise) to the suppression\nof the visibility. The full lines have been obtained from the exact result (19) by dividing by the result at zero\nvoltage, v V 6=0 (t)/v V =0 (t). The dashed lines represent the approximation of restricting matrix elements of \u0175\nto the voltage window, see (37). We have set eV \u03c3/vdet = 1 in this panel. Middle: Universal curves for the\neigenvalues \u03c6j of the restricted matrix \u0175\u2032 entering the visibility v \u2032 (t) in equation (37), plotted as a function\nof eV t in the limit \u03c3 \u2192 0. Right : Locations of the zeroes in the visibility v \u2032 (t) as a function of coupling g\n(compare figures 3 and 6). These curves can be obtained from those on the left by taking (2n + 1)\u03c0/(\u03c6j /g),\nwith n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (from bottom to top). The blue dotted line corresponds to the first curve displaced\nby 2\u03c0, indicating the periodicity observed for small couplings g. In both panels, the green dashed line shows\nthe short-time behaviour \u03c61 = geV t/2\u03c0.\nWe note that the limit \u03c3 \u2192 0 is well-defined, and we will assume this limit in the following, in which results\nbecome independent of the shape of the interaction potential. This limit represents a good approximation as\nsoon as the time is sufficiently large: vdet t \u226b \u03c3. In that limit, the eigenvalues have the following functional\ndependence:\n(g=1)\n\n\u03c6j = g * \u03c6j\n\n(eV t).\n\n(43)\n\nThus the complete behaviour at all coupling strengths can be inferred by numerically evaluating the eigenvalues once as a function of eV t. This has been done in figure 6.\nAt T = 1/2, the visibility v \u2032 (t) will vanish whenever one of these eigenvalues is equal to (2n + 1)\u03c0, where\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Thus, the locations of the zeroes can be obtained from the equation (2n + 1)\u03c0 = \u03c6j , or\n(g=1)\n. The latter equation has the advantage that the rhs is independent of\nequivalently g = (2n + 1)\u03c0/\u03c6j\ng. It has been used in the right panel of figure 6. These curves have also been inserted into figure 3, for\ncomparison against the results from the full theory. In particular, the first zero is reproduced very accurately,\nwhile there are some quantitative deviations at subsequent zeroes.\nThe full pattern of the visibility, as a function of interaction time and coupling strength, can become\nvery complex due to the large number of lines of vanishing visibility v \u2032 . This is depicted in figure 6.\nThe analysis in the next section indicates (and the numerical results displayed in figure 6 confirm) that\nthe spacing between the subsequent zeroes in the visibility is no longer determined by g, but rather given\nby 2\u03c0/eV (with deviations at higher g). As we will explain in the next section, this corresponds to one\nadditional detector electron passing by the qubit during the interaction time.\n\n3.2\n\nWave packet picture\n\nFollowing Martin and Landauer [47], we introduce a new basis of states inside the voltage window, whose\nwidth in k-space is set by \u2206k \u2261 eV /vdet :\n|\u03c8n i =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206k\n2\u03c0/L\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\nX\n\nk\u2208[0,\u2206k]\n\n13\n\ne\u2212ikn\u2206x |ki .\n\n(44)\n\n\f30\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n\nCoupling g\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n10\n\nVisibility v'\n\n0.7\n\n20\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nTime or voltage, eVt\nFigure 6: Nonequilibrium part of the visibility, v \u2032 , as a function of coupling strength g and time (or voltage)\neV t. The lines of vanishing v \u2032 are those plotted in figure 5. The structure will be distorted for \u03c3 > 0, and\nthe full visibility v will be further suppressed at higher couplings by the dephasing due to equilibrium noise,\nsee (36).\n\n14\n\n\fIn real space, these states represent a train of wavepackets, spaced apart by \u2206x = 2\u03c0/\u2206k = vdet \u2206t,\ncorresponding to time bins of duration \u2206t = h/eV = 2\u03c0/eV .

In general, for large |n| and |n\u2032 | the corresponding\nwave packets lie outside the range of w(x) and therefore the corresponding matrix elements are small and\ncan be neglected. In the limit of small voltages, the matrix \u0175\u2032 is already diagonal in this basis (compare\n(41)):\n\u0015\n\u0014\ngeV t\n\u03b4n\u2032 0 \u03b4n0 .\n(49)\nh\u03c8n\u2032 |\u0175| \u03c8n i \u2248\n2\u03c0\nMoreover, the wave packet basis permits a very intuitive interpretation of the results in the Gaussian approximation: First, let us assume that the number of contributing wave packets is large, N \u2261 eV t/2\u03c0 \u226b 1.\nThe wave packets are orthonormalized, and the phase function w(x) is smooth on the scale \u2206x = vdet \u2206t =\nv2\u03c0/eV of these packets (for sufficiently large voltages). As a result, we find that the matrix \u0175 is diagonal\nin this basis, up to terms of order 1/N :\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\nh\u03c8n\u2032 |\u0175| \u03c8n i \u2248 \u03b4n\u2032 n w(x = n\u2206x) + O\n.\n(50)\nN\nTherefore, in any sum over the eigenvalues \u03c6j , these can be approximated by the values of w taken at the\ncenters of the wave packets. Assuming further that the coupling g \u226a 1 is weak, each of the \u03c6j is small. This\nallows us to expand the visibility reduction due to nonequilibrium noise:\nX\n1\nv \u2032 (t) = \u03a0j |R + T e\u2212i\u03c6j | \u2248 1 \u2212 RT\n\u03c62j + . . .\n2\nj\n\n(51)\n\nThat is the expected result, which has the form of \"phase diffusion\", with a contribution from the variance of\nthe phase shift exerted by each detector electron. In the limit of \u03c3 \u226a eV t, we get \u03c6j = g for approximately\nN wave packets, and zero otherwise.

Defining the average phase shift induced\nby a single detector electron as \u03c6\u0304 = dx w(x)/(N \u2206x) = (geV t/2\u03c0)/N , we can write\nX\nj\n\n\u03c62j \u2248 N \u03c6\u03042 .\n\n(55)\n\nNote that in the case of a constant w(x), we have leff = vdet t, and therefore N = eV t and \u03c6\u0304 = g, so we are\nback to (52).\n\n4\n\nComparison with dephasing by classical telegraph noise\n\nIn this section, we compare and contrast the results we have obtained in the rest of this paper against the\nsimplest possible model displaying non-Gaussian features in dephasing: pure dephasing of a qubit by classical\nrandom telegraph noise. There, visibility oscillations are observed once the coupling strength becomes large\nas compared to the switching rate of the two-state fluctuator producing the telegraph noise. In the limit of a\nvanishing switching rate, the visibility in that model is the average of two oscillatory phase factors evolving\nat different frequencies, corresponding to the two different energy shifts imparted by the two-state fluctuator:\nv tel.noise (t) = |(1 \u2212 p) + pe\u2212i\u03b4\u03c9t |.\n\n(56)\n\nIf the occupation probability of the two fluctuator states is p = 1/2, this leads to visibility oscillations\nv tel.noise (t) = |cos(\u03b4\u03c9t)|, roughly similar to those found in our full quantum theory of dephasing by shot\nnoise. The decaying envelope of these oscillations is then produced by a finite switching probability.\nIt is instructive to set up a rough correspondence between that simple model and the one considered\nhere, and see how far it takes us (and where it fails): According to the well-known semiclassical picture of\nbinomial shot noise [30], during the time-interval \u2206t = h/eV = 2\u03c0/eV a single detector electron arrives\nwith a probability T . It imparts a phase shift g within our model. Thus, the fluctuator probability p would\nequal T , the mean time between telegraph noise switching events would be taken as \u2206t, and the frequency\ndifference \u03b4\u03c9 would have to be set equal to g/\u2206t. This analogy partly suggests the right qualitative behaviour,\nnamely a threshold in g that is independent of voltage (independent of \u2206t). This threshold turns\npout to be\ng = 1 in the telegraph noise model, and for larger g the visibility oscillates with a period 4\u03c0\u2206t/ g 2 \u2212 1 (if\np = T = 1/2). Although this correctly suggests that the first zero occurs at a position t \u221d 1/(eV g), it predicts\nall subsequent zeroes to occur at the same period, which is not compatible with the actual behaviour (see\nfigure 3). These discrepancies are not too surprising, since the two models certainly differ even qualitatively\nin the following sense: In random telegraph noise, the switching occurs in a Markoff process, i.e. without\nmemory. In contrast, in the semiclassical model of binomial shot noise the electrons arrive in a stream of\nregularly spaced time-bins of size \u2206t = h/eV . We have not found any reasonable way of incorporating this\nfact into a simplified semiclassical model, since it is unclear how to treat 'fractional time-bins' within such\na model.\n\n5\n\nElectronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer coupled to a detector\nedge channel\n\nIn this section we will show how to explain the surprising experimental results that have been obtained\nrecently in a strongly coupled \"which-path detector system\" involving a Mach-Zehnder interferometer coupled\nto a \"detector\" edge channel. We will present a nonperturbative treatment that captures all the essential\nfeatures due to the non-Gaussian nature of the detector shot noise. Our approximate solution for this model\nis directly related to the exact solution of the simpler charge qubit system discussed above.\n16\n\n\fA simplified scheme of the experimental setup is presented in figure 1 (see [31, 32] for a detailed explanation). Both the MZI and the detector were realized utilizing chiral one-dimensional edge-channels in the\ninteger Quantum Hall effect regime. The MZI phase was controlled by a modulation gate via the AharonovBohm (AB) effect. The additional edge channel was partitioned by a quantum point contact, before traveling\nin close proximity to the upper path of the MZI, serving as a \"which path\" phase-sensitive detector [23]. For\na finite bias applied to the detector channel, the Coulomb interaction between both channels caused orbital\nentanglement between the interfering electron and the detecting electrons, thereby decreasing the contrast of\nthe AB oscillations. This contrast, quantified in terms of the visibility v = (Imax \u2212 Imin )/(Imax + Imin ), was\nmeasured as a function of the DC bias V applied at the detector channel, and of the partitioning probability\nT of the detector channel.\nAs noted already in the introduction, two new and peculiar effects, which will be explained here, were\nobserved in these experiments:\n\u2022 Unexpected dependence on partitioning: The visibility as a function of T changes from the expected\nsmooth parabolic suppression \u221d T (1 \u2212 T ) at low detector voltages to a sharp \"V-shape\" behaviour at\nsome larger voltages, with almost zero visibility at T = 1/2 (see Fig. 3 in [32]).\n\u2022 Visibility oscillations: For some values of the detector QPC gate voltage (yielding T \u2248 1/2), the\nvisibility drops to zero at intermediate voltages, then reappears again as V increases, in order to vanish\nat even larger voltages (see Fig. 4 in [32]). For some other gate voltages it decreases monotonically\n(see Fig. 2 in [31]).\nIn [32] we showed that a simplified model involving a single detector electron can provide a qualitative\nexplanation for the experimental results listed above. However, it has clear shortcomings, both quantitative\nand in terms of the physical interpretation. The natural reason for these shortcomings is that detection in\nthe experiment is due to a varying number of electrons, not just a single one. Then two questions arise: (i)\nHow many electrons dephase the MZI as the detector voltage increases, and (ii) how much does each electron\ncontribute to dephasing. These questions will be answered by the following model.\n\n5.1\n\nSolution of the single-particle problem\n\nThe main simplifying assumption in our approach will be that it is possible to treat each given electron\nin the Mach-Zehnder interferometer on its own, as a single particle interacting with the fluctuations of the\ndensity in the detector channel. Making this assumption is far from being a trivial step, as it effectively\nneglects Pauli blocking, and we will have to comment on it in the next section. For now, however, let us\ndefine the following model as our starting point:\nZ\n\u0124 = vMZ p\u0302 + dx\u2032 u(x\u2032 \u2212 x\u0302)\u03c1\u0302det (x\u2032 ) + \u0124det .\n(57)\n\nHere x\u0302 and p\u0302 = \u2212i\u2202x are the position and the momentum operator, respectively, of the single interfering\nelectron under consideration (traveling in the upper, interacting path of the interferometer). We have\nlinearized the dispersion relation, keeping in mind that the interferometer's visibility will be determined\nby the electrons near the MZ Fermi energy, traveling at a speed vMZ . The Fermi energy itself has been\nsubtracted as an irrelevant energy offset, and likewise the momentum is measured with respect to the Fermi\nmomentum. The Aharonov-Bohm phase between the interfering paths would have to be added by hand.\nWe thus realize that the situation is analogous to the model treated above, involving pure dephasing of\na charge qubit. The two states of the qubit correspond to the two paths which the interfering electron can\ntake. The following analysis explicitly demonstrates this equivalence and arrives at an expression for the\nvisibility which is the analogue of equation (6). The only difference will be the replacement of vdet by the\nrelative velocity vdet \u2212 vMZ , which can be understood by going into the frame of reference of the MZ electron.\nLet us now consider the full wave function |\u03a8total (t)i = e+i\u0124det t e\u2212i\u0124t |\u03a8total (0)i of MZI and detector,\nexpressed in the interaction\nR picture with respect to \u0124det . One can always decompose the full wave function\nin the form |\u03a8total (t)i = dx |xi \u2297 |\u03c8(x, t)i. Here, we focus on the projection |\u03c8(x, t)i \u2261 hx |\u03a8total (t) i onto\nthe MZI single-particle position basis. This is a state in the detector Hilbert space, with h \u03c8(x, t)| \u03c8(x, t)i\ngiving the probability of the MZI electron to be found at position x. It obeys the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n17\n\n\f\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202\n\u2202\n|\u03c8(x, t)i = \u2212ivMZ\n+ V\u0302 (x, t) |\u03c8(x, t)i ,\n(58)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\nR\nwhere the fluctuating potential V\u0302 (x, t) \u2261 dx\u2032 u(x\u2032 \u2212 x)\u03c1\u0302det (x\u2032 , t) is in the interaction picture with respect\nto \u0124det . The exact solution of equation (58) that follows from the Hamiltonian (57) reads:\ni\n\n\u0014\n\n|\u03c8(x, t)i = T\u0302 exp \u2212i\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u0015\ndt V\u0302 (x \u2212 vMZ t , t \u2212 t ) |\u03c8(x \u2212 vMZ t, 0)i .\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(59)\n\nThus, at a given space-time point (x, t), the \"quantum phase\" in the exponent is an integral over the values\nof the fluctuating potential at all points on the \"line of influence\" (x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) with x \u2212 x\u2032 = vMZ (t \u2212 t\u2032 ). If the\npotential were classical, the exponential would represent a simple phase factor. Here, however, the interfering\nelectron is not only acted upon by the fluctuations but also changes the state of the detector. The state\n|\u03c8(x, t)i contains all the information about the entanglement between the MZI electron and the detector\nelectrons.\nWe will now determine the visibility resulting from the interaction between interferometer and detector\nchannel. At the first beam splitter, the electron's wave packet is decomposed into two parts, one of them\ntraveling along the lower (l) arm of the interferometer, the other one traveling along the upper (u) arm.\nThese are described by states |\u03c8l (x, t)i and |\u03c8u (x, t)i, respectively, which obey the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\ngiven above, albeit in general with a different noise potential for each of them. The visibility is determined\nby the overlap between those two states, taken at the position x = vMZ t of the second beam splitter (where\nt is the time-of-flight through the interferometer):\nv = |h\u03c8l (x, t)|\u03c8u (x, t)i| .\n\n(60)\n\nTaking into account that |\u03c8l,u (0, 0)i = |\u03a8det i is the detector's initial unperturbed state, and realizing that\nthe interaction takes place only in the upper arm, we find that the visibility is determined by the probability\namplitude for the electron to exit the MZI without having changed the state of the detector [18]:\nv=\n\n\u001c\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03a8det T\u0302 exp \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\u001d\n\u0015\ndt V\u0302 (x \u2212 vMZ t , t \u2212 t ) \u03a8det .\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(61)\n\nThe initial detector state |\u03a8det i itself is produced by partitioning a stream of electrons.\nThe last step consists in representing equation (61) as an expectation value of a unitary operator:\nv=\n\nE\nD\n\u03a8det e\u2212i\u03a6\u0302 \u03a8det ,\n\n(62)\n\nwhere \u03a6\u0302 is defined as the operator in the exponent of (61). We have been allowed to drop the time ordering\nsymbol because the density fluctuations in the one-dimensional detector channel are described by free bosons:\n[\u03c1\u0302(x, t), \u03c1\u0302(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )] is a purely imaginary c-number. The time-ordered exponential is by definition a product\nof many small unitary evolutions sorted by time. Hence, using repeatedly the Baker-Hausdorff formula\ne\u00c2 eB\u0302 = e\u00c2+B\u0302 e[\u00c2,B\u0302]/2 , which holds since [\u00c2, B\u0302] commutes with \u00c2 and B\u0302 in this case, we can collect the\noperators at different times into the same exponent. The remaining c-number exponent only contributes a\nphase, so it does not lead to a reduction in the visibility and we can disregard it.\nThe phase operator \u03a6\u0302 in (62) is therefore a weighted integral over the density operator:\n\u03a6\u0302 =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndt V\u0302 (x \u2212 vMZ t , t \u2212 t ) =\n\nZ\n\ndx\u2032 w(x\u2032 )\u03c1\u0302det (x\u2032 )dx\u2032 =\n\nX\n\nwk\u2032 k d\u02c6\u2020k\u2032 d\u02c6k .\n\n(63)\n\nk,k\u2032\n\nThe phase function w(x) is the one that has been introduced before, in equation (18), with the exception\nthat the detector velocity has to be replaced by the relative velocity: vdet 7\u2192 vdet \u2212 vMZ . It can be viewed as\na convolution of the interaction potential u(x) with the \"window of influence\" of length l = |(vdet \u2212 vMZ )t|\ndefined by the traversal time t and the velocities.\n18\n\n\f5.2\n\nApproximate treatment of Pauli blocking\n\nThe loss of visibility is due to the trace a particle leaves in the detector [18]. If the detector (or, in general,\nthe environment) is in its ground state initially, this means that the detector has to be left in an excited state\nafterwards. Energy conservation implies that the energy has to be supplied by the particle itself. This is no\nproblem if the particle starts out in an excited state. An example is provided by a qubit in a superposition\nof ground and excited state, which can decay to its ground state by spontaneous emission of radiation into\na zero-temperature environment.\nHowever, in electronic interference experiments such as the one considered here, we are interested in\nthe loss of visibility with regard to the interference pattern observed in the linear conductance. At zero\ntemperature, this implies we are dealing with electrons right at the Fermi surface which have no phase space\navailable for decay into lower-energy states, due to Pauli blocking. Only an environment that is itself in a\nnonequilibrium state (e.g. the voltage-biased detector channel) can then lead to dephasing. This very basic\nphysical picture has been confirmed by many different calculations. While it is, in principle, conceivable that\nsubtle non-perturbative effects might eventually lead to a break-down of this picture, we are not aware of\nany unambiguous and uncontroversial theoretical derivation of a suppression of linear conductance visibility\nat zero temperature, for an interferometer coupled to an equilibrium quantum bath.\nThe main difficulty in dealing with an electronic interferometer coupled to a quantum bath thus lies in\nthe necessity of treating the full many-body problem. Any model that considers only a single interfering\nparticle subject to the environment will miss the effects of Pauli blocking, and thereby permit unphysical,\nartificial dephasing by spontaneous emission events that would be absent in a full treatment. In [38, 40],\nit was shown how to properly incorporate these effects into an equations-of-motion approach similar to the\none described above (with the fermion field \u03c8\u0302(x, t) taking the role of the single-particle state |\u03c8(x, t)i). The\nmain idea was that the state of the detector, and therefore the noise potential V\u0302 , will itself be influenced\nby the density in the interferometer, leading to \"backaction terms\" (known from the quantum Langevin\nequation for quantum dissipative systems) that ultimately ensure Pauli blocking. However, in order to be\nable to solve the equations of motion of the environment, it was crucial to assume Gaussian quantum noise,\nand even then the solution for the visibility was carried out only to lowest order in the coupling. Thus,\nthis approach is not feasible for the present problem, where we want to keep non-Gaussian effects in a\nfully nonperturbative way. Nevertheless, the underlying intuitive physical picture remains valid: If both the\ninterferometer and the detector are near their ground states, the interfering electron will get \"dressed\" by\ndistorting the detector electron density in its vicinity, but this perturbation is undone when it leaves the\ninteraction region. Therefore no trace is left and there is no contribution to the dephasing rate.\nWe therefore resort to an approximate treatment (applicable to the zero-temperature situation), suggested\nby the general physical picture described above. We will continue to use the single-particle picture for\nthe interferometer, but keep only the nonequilibrium part of the noise, thus eliminating the possibility of\nartificial dephasing for the case when the detector is not biased. In fact, within a lowest-order perturbative\ncalculation, this scheme gives exactly the right answers: Firstly, dephasing by the quantum equilibrium noise\nof the detector channel is completely eliminated by Pauli blocking, as follows from the analysis of [38, 40]\n(at T = 0, for the linear conductance). Secondly, the remaining nonequilibrium part of the noise spectrum,\ncorresponding to the shot noise, is symmetric in frequency, and thus equivalent to purely classical noise\nwhose effects are not diminished by Pauli blocking (see discussions in [40, 48]).\nThe analysis in section 3.1 has demonstrated that all the non-Gaussian features are due to the nonequilibrium part which we retain. Therefore, we expect that the present approximation should be able to reproduce\nthe novel features observed in the experiment, which is confirmed by comparison with the experimental data.\nWe emphasize once more that it is crucial to supplement the single-particle picture by taking care of the\nPauli principle afterwards.\nThus, we shall restrict the matrix elements in equation (63) to the voltage window, replacing wk\u2032 k by the\nrestricted wk\u2032 \u2032 k , according to the notation introduced in section 3.1. All that remains to be done to calculate\nthe visibility is diagonalizing the operator \u03a6\u0302, which is achieved by switching to the basis of eigenstates of w\u2032 ,\n\u03a6\u0302 =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6j \u0109\u2020j \u0109j ,\n\n(64)\n\nj\n\nwhere \u03c6j are the eigenvalues and \u0109j is the annihilation operator for eigenstate j of w\u2032 .

The \"V-shape\" is clearly observed. Inset : Visibility at T = 1/2 as a\nfunction of eV t. The locations corresponding to the curves in the main plot are indicated. Other parameters:\ng = 5 and temperature T = 0.\noperators \u0109\u2020j \u0109j fluctuate independently, and all states j have the same occupation probability T , just like\nthe states in the original basis. This is a consequence of the occupation matrix being proportional to the\nidentity matrix, as pointed out near equation (37). Therefore, equation (63) reduces to\nD\nE\nE\nD\n\u2020\nv \u2032 = e\u2212i\u03a6\u0302 = \u03a8det \u03a0j e\u2212i\u03c6j \u0109j \u0109j \u03a8det = \u03a0j R + T e\u2212i\u03c6j .\n(65)\n\nThis formula is our main result for the visibility of the MZI, valid at zero temperature. It gives a closed\nexpression for the reduction of the interference contrast in the AB oscillations of the MZI, as a function of\ndetector bias and partitioning probability T . It has been calculated nonperturbatively within the approximation discussed above, i.e. employing a single-particle picture for the interfering electron and simultaneously\nretaining only the nonequilibrium part of the detector noise. At any given detector voltage V , there exists a\nbasis of states in the detector, which, when occupied, contribute to the MZI phase by different amounts \u03c6j .\nThese occupations fluctuate due to the partitioning at the detector beam splitter. The visibility then is the\nproduct of all those influences.\n\n5.3\n\nDependence of visibility on detector voltage and detector partitioning\n\nThe visibility for the Mach-Zehnder interferometer subject to the shot noise in the detector channel may\nthus be calculated in the same manner as the visibility for the charge qubit treated above, if the restriction\nto the nonequilibrium part of the noise is taken into account. The main difference is that in the MZI the\ninteraction time t is dictated by the setup. However, in the limit \u03c3 \u2192 0, the visibility v \u2032 only depends on the\nproduct eV t. Thus the plots above (figures 5 (b,c) and 6) also depict the dependence of v \u2032 on the voltage at\nfixed time t.\n20\n\n\fAt small bias voltages, only one eigenvalue is nonzero and grows linearly with detector voltage, according\nto equation (41): \u03c61 = geV t/2\u03c0 \u2261 \u03b3V . Thus, the visibility is\nv \u2032 = |R + T e\u2212i\u03b3V |,\n\n(66)\n\nwhere the proportionality constant \u03b3 may be measured from the voltage-dependent phase shift obtained for\nthe non-partitioned case, T = 1. Equation (66) represents the influence of \"exactly one detecting electron\".\nOne can obtain (66) as an ansatz, by postulating that exactly one detector electron interacts with the\ninterfering electron [32]. Here we obtained it naturally as a limiting case of our full expression. It has to\nbe emphasized that this result is highly counterintuitive: Naively, one would assume that each detector\nelectron induces a constant phase shift that is set by the coupling strength and does not depend on the\ndetector voltage. The voltage V should only control the frequency at which detector electrons are injected.\nHowever, to the extent that we identify each eigenvalue \u03c6j with one detector electron, we have to conclude\nthat this naive picture is wrong. Formally, only a single, very extended detector wavepacket of size \u221d V \u22121\ninteracts with the quantum system, i.e. the charge qubit or the interfering electron (see section 3.2). As\nthe interaction range is fixed and limited, this means that the phase shift (basically the expectation value of\nw(x) in terms of this wave packet) then shrinks with V . The linear dependence of the phase shift on voltage\nthus may be rationalized by taking into account energy conservation: At lower detector voltages V the phase\nspace for scattering of detector electrons gets restricted severely, and thus the effective interaction strength\nis diminished. Likewise, the spatial resolution of this which-path detector becomes very poor, as is apparent\nfrom the large extent of the wave packet: Detection at a high spatial resolution would prepare a localized\nstate that contains a lot of energy, more than is available in the detector-interferometer system.\nRegarding the dependence on the transmission probability of the detector channel (figure 7), we note\nthat there are strong deviations from the smooth dependence exp[\u2212CT (1 \u2212 T )] expected for any Gaussian\nnoise model (where C would depend on V, t, g, . . . but not on T ). These deviations are particularly strong\nnear the voltages for which the visibility becomes zero at T = 1/2. Indeed, if only one eigenvalue contributes\nand is equal to \u03c0, equation (66) yields a \"V-shape\" of the visibility, v \u2032 = |1 \u2212 2T |, as indicated by the dashed\nline in figure 7.\n\n5.4\n\nComparison with experiment\n\nIn this section we briefly discuss the results obtained by fitting the present model to the experimental data.\nThis follows our discussion in [32], where the reader may find the relevant figures.\nAt the outset, we note that the visibility in the real experiment is also suppressed by external lowfrequency fluctuations, beyond the detector-induced dephasing discussed here. They contribute an overall\nvoltage-independent factor that has to be introduced as a fitting parameter when comparing against theory.\nFirst, we consider the approximation (66) obtained for low voltages, involving only one detector electron.\nSince the constant \u03b3 was measured, this formula does not contain any free parameters, and can be compared\ndirectly with the experimental data. As shown in Fig. 3 of [32], it fits very well to the data at low V and\nqualitatively reproduces the novel effects mentioned at the beginning of section 5. In particular, it predicts\nthe change from a smooth shape to a V-shape in the dependence of visibility on partitioning probability, as\nwell as the non-monotonous behaviour with increasing V . However, according to (66) these effects should\noccur when \u03b3V = \u03c0, which does not agree with the experimental observations, where the zero in the visibility\nis shifted to a detector bias that is larger than this estimate by about 40%. Hence at this detector bias (66)\nfails to quantitatively reproduce the experimental results. The reason of this discrepancy must be the onset\nof the contributions from other detecting electrons. Once other eigenvalues become slightly non-zero, the\nfirst one is smaller than \u03b3V , because of the sum rule (38) and the non-negativity of the eigenvalues, (39).\nThis is clearly apparent in figure 6. The visibility then vanishes at larger values of the detector voltage\nV , in agreement with experiment. At even larger voltages, near \u03c61 \u2248 2\u03c0, the visibility will have again a\nmaximum (coherence revival). However, it will be smaller due to the dephasing by the other detecting states\n(other \u03c6j ), again in contrast to the simplified formula (66). These two effects have both been seen in the\nexperiment (Fig. 4 in [32]).\nFinally, in [32], we fitted the experimental data by using, for simplicity, a Lorentzian shape as an ansatz\nfor the Fourier transform of the phase function:\n21\n\n\fw\u0303(q) =\n\nw\u0303(q = 0)\n\u00112\n\u0010\ndet\n1 + qv\neV\u2217\n\n(67)\n\nHere V\u2217 has the dimensions of a voltage and turns out to be V\u2217 \u2248 6.2 \u03bcV . Within this fit, the first eigenvalue\nis \u03c61 \u2248 0.8\u03c0 at V = 9.5\u03bcV , where \u03b3V = \u03c0. This implies that almost the full phase shift of \u03c0 is contributed\nby a single electron, indicating very strong interchannel interaction.\n\n5.5\n\nRelation to intrinsic visibility oscillations\n\nWhile the earliest implementation of the electronic MZI [22] displayed a rather smooth monotonous decay\nof the visibility with rising MZI bias voltage, this is no longer true in a more recent version [34]. There,\nthe visibility displayed oscillations, much like the ones observed here, except they occured as a function\nof MZI bias voltage, in the absence of any detector channel. The present analysis may lead to a possible\nexplanation for these initially puzzling observations: The intrinsic intra-channel interaction may cause the\ninterfering electrons to be dephased by their own (non-Gaussian) shot noise, if the bias is large enough. We\nnote that a similar explanation was put forward in a recent preprint of Sukhorukov and Cheianov [42], who\nconsidered a model where two counterpropagating edge channels interacted with each other. Though their\nmodel is therefore different from ours, we have seen that the visibility oscillations are a generic consequence\nof dephasing by non-Gaussian shot noise, and therefore it is hard to distinguish experimentally (at this point)\nbetween the different models.\n\n6\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe presented a nonperturbative approach to the dephasing of a quantum system by an adjacent partitioned\none-dimensional electron channel, serving as a detector. Our treatment gave an exact expression for the\ntime-evolution of the visibility of a charge qubit coupled to such a detector. Moreover, within a certain\nsimplifying approximation, it can be used to describe a \"controlled dephasing\" (or \"which path\") setup\nwhere a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is coupled to a detector channel.\nThe main features of our results are the following: The visibility may display oscillations as a function\nof time or detector voltage, vanishing exactly at certain points and yielding \"coherence revivals\" in-between\nthose points. This behaviour is only observed if the coupling strength crosses a certain voltage-independent\nthreshold, corresponding to a phase-shift of g = \u03c0 contributed by a single electron. It is impossible to obtain\nthat behaviour in any model of dephasing by Gaussian noise, regardless of the assumed noise spectrum. The\nlocation of the first zero of the visibility (in detector voltage or interaction time) is proportional to 1/g for\nlarge couplings g, while the spacing of subsequent zeroes is approximately independent of g and corresponds\nto injecting one additional detector electron during the interaction time. When plotted as a function of\ndetector transmission probability, the visibility differs from the smooth dependence on T (1 \u2212 T ) expected\nfor any Gaussian model, rather displaying a \"V-shape\" at certain voltages.\nAll of these features have been observed in the recent Mach-Zehnder experiment [32]. Challenges for\nfuture experiments include more quantitative comparisons against the theory presented here, as well as\nfinding ways of tuning the interaction strength g, to switch between the strong and weak coupling regimes.\nIn addition, we hope that the strong coupling physics of dephasing by non-Gaussian shot noise will be seen\nin future experiments involving various other kinds of quantum systems as well.\nAcknowledgements. - We thank B.
