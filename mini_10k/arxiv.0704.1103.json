A distinctive feature of this study is that the spin-rich\nqqq force is generated by a ggg vertex ( a genuine part of the QCD\nLagrangian ) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on as many quark\nlines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) Y -shaped diagram. The\ndynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation ( 3D support for the kernel) formulated covariantly on the light front, a la Markov-Yukawa\nTransversality Principle (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2\nas well as 3 fermion quarks.

Indeed a 3-body qqq force of this type, albeit for 'scalar' gluons,\nwas first suggested by Ernest Ma [1], when QCD was still in its infancy. [ A\nsimilar representation is also possible for NNN interaction via \u03c1\u03c1\u03c1 or \u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\nvertices, but was never in fashion in the literature [2]]. We note in passing\nthat a Y -shaped (Mercedes-Benz type) picture [3] was once considered in the\ncontext of a preon model for quarks and leptons.\nIn the context of QCD as a Yang-Mills field, a ggg vertex has a momentum\nrepresentation of the form [4]\nWggg = \u2212igs fabc [(k1 \u2212 k2 )\u03bb \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd + (k2 \u2212 k3 )\u03bc \u03b4\u03bd\u03bb + (k3 \u2212 k1 )\u03bd \u03b4\u03bb\u03bc ]\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere the 4-momenta emanating from the ggg vertex satisfy k1 + k2 + k3 = 0,\nand fabc is the color factor. When this vertex is folded into 3 q\u0304gq vertices\nof the respective forms gs \u016b(p\u20321 )i\u03b3\u03bc {\u03bba1 /2}u(p1), and two similar terms, the\nresultant qqq interaction matrix (suppressing the Dirac spinors for the 3\nquarks) becomes\nVqqq =\n\ngs4 (1)\n[i\u03b3 .(k2 \u2212 k3 )\u03b3 (2) .\u03b3 (3) + {2} + {3}]{\u03bb1\u03bb2 \u03bb3 }/{k12 k22 k32 }\n3\n2\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere ki = pi \u2212 p\u2032i ; \u03bbi are the color matrices which get contracted into the\ncorresponding scalar triple products in an obvious notation. [Note that the\nflavour indices are absent here since the quark gluon interaction is flavour\nblind].\nThis interaction will be considered in conjunction with 3 pairs of qq forces\nwithin the framework of a Bethe-Salpeter type dynamics to be specified below. Before proceeding in this direction, it is in order to explain a possible motivation behind the use of a direct qqq force with such a rich spin\ndependence. Apart from the intrinsic beauty of this term, the immediate\nprovocation for its use comes from the issue of \"proton spin\" which, after\nmaking headlines about two decades ago, has come to the fore once again,\n2\n\n\fthanks to the progress of experimental techniques in polarized deep inelastic\nscattering off polarized protons, and their variations thereof, which allow for\nan experimental determination of certain key QCD parameters by relating\nthem to certain observable quantities emanating from external probes ; ( see\na recent review [5] for references and other details). On the other hand it\nis also of considerable theoretical interest to determine these very quantities\ndirectly from the intrinsic premises of QCD provided one has a \" good \"\nqqq wave function to play with. Such a plea would have sounded rather\nutopian in the early days of QCD when phenomenology was the order of\nthe day. Today however many aspects of QCD are understood well enough\nto make such studies worthwhile by hindsight, with possible ramifications\nbeyond their educational value. The role of the direct 3-body force may be\nseen in this light, while working for simplicity in the experimentally accessible regime of valence quarks. To that end this paper is specifically concerned\nwith the effect of the 3-body force (1.2) on the analytical structure of the\nqqq wave function, while the formalism dealing with the contributions of the\nvarious operators ( i\u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 , 2-gluon effects, etc) to the proton spin is reserved\nfor a subsequent paper.\n\n1.1\n\nTheoretical Ingredients\n\nIn the valence quark regime, we need to consider a qqq system governed by\npairwise qq forces as well as a direct 3-quark force of the type (1.2). A further\nsimplification occurs in the high momentum regime where the effect of confining forces may be neglected, so that only coulombic forces need be kept track\nof. We shall take the dynamics of a qqq hadron in the high \u2212 momentum\nregime to be governed by a Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) whose kernel\nis a sum of three pairs of (coulombic) qq forces plus a single 3-body term\n(1.2). Unfortunately the 4D form of the BSE is too general to be of practical value for qqq dynamics, so a better option is the Salpeter Equation [6]\nrepresenting its instantaneous form. And, except for its lack of covariance,\nthe Salpeter equation has the remarkable property of 3D-4D interlinkage, a\nfeature that had been present all along in the original formulation itself [6],\nbut had somehow remained hidden from view in the literature, until clarified\n[7] in the context of a comprehensive two \u2212 tier BSE formalism developed\nindependently in a covariant manner [8]. (A practical significance of the\n'two-tier' formalism is that the reduced 3D form is ideal for the determination of hadron mass spectra of both q q\u0304 and qqq types [9, 10], while the\n3\n\n\freconstructed 4D form is convenient for the evaluation of transition amplitudes [9] via Feynman techniques for loop diagrams; see also Munz et al\nref.(9) ). A covariant formulation of the BSE is centered around the hadron\n4-momentum P\u03bc in accordance with the Markov-Yukawa Transversality Principle (MYTP) [11, 12], which was shown to be a 'gauge principle' in disguise\n[13]. It ensures that the interactions among the constituents be transverse\nto the direction of P\u03bc . In the high momentum regime to be considered here,\nthe confining interaction has been ignored for simplicity, which leaves the\n3D form of the BS dynamics inadequate for mass spectral determination, yet\nits dynamical on the spin-structure of the wave function should be realistic\nenough for dealing with the hadron spin in the high momentum limit.\nNow to another vital element of the theory: Although the Salpeter Equation, as the instant form of BSE, admits of a covariant formulation in the\nrest frame of the total hadron 4-momentum P\u03bc , it suffers from certain illdefined 4D loop integrals due to a 'Lorentz-mismatch' among the rest-frames\nof the participating hadronic composites, resulting in time-like momentum\ncomponents in the exponential/gaussian factors associated with their vertex\nfunctions. This is especially true of triangle loops, such as applicable to the\npion form factor and \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c0\u03c0 coupling [14] where this disease causes unwarranted \"complexities\" in the amplitudes, while two-quark loops just escape\nthis pathology. For a possible remedy against this disease, without losing the\nbenefit of an MYTP - based 3D-4D interconnection, a promising candidate\nis the light-front approach of Dirac [15] by virtue of its bigger (7) stability group compared with 6 for the instant form theory. Its basic simplicity\nwas first noticed by Weinberg [16] who formulated the infinite momentum\nframe towards the same end. A covariant generalization of MYTP on the\nlight front, requiring the use of two null 4-vectors n\u03bc and \u00f1\u03bc that satisfy\nn2 = \u00f12 = 0 and n.\u00f1 = 1, cures the 'Lorentz mismatch' disease noted above\n[17]. The remaining problem of n- dependence of transition amplitudes is\nsolved through a simple ansatz of 'Lorentz completion' [17, 18], so as to yield\na Lorentz-invariant pion e.m. form factor in accord with experiment . A similar approach had been considered by Carbonell et al [19] in the context of\nthe Kadychevsky-Karmanov formalism [20, 21], except for their missing out\non the second (dual) null-vector \u00f1 which happens to be crucial for recovering\na Lorentz - invariant structure in a more natural way.\n\n4\n\n\f1.2\n\nPlan of the Paper\n\nThe plan of the paper is based on an interlinked 3D-4D BSE formalism characterized by a Lorentz-covariant 3D support for its kernel a la MYTP [11, 12],\nadapted to the light front (LF) [17]. The full structure of the kernel is a sum\nof 3 pairs of coulombic qq forces plus a qqq force, Eq.(1.2), whose 3D support\nis implied by the fact that all internal momenta q be transverse to P\u03bc ,\nviz., q\u0302\u03bc = q\u03bc \u2212 q.P P\u03bc /P 2 . However the propagators are left untouched in\ntheir standard 4D forms. [The light front formulation requires a collinear\nframe [17] which is further specified in Section 2 ]. The strategy now lies\nin a step-wise reduction of the (Salpeter-like) 4D Master Equation involving\nthe actual (4D) fermionic wave function \u03a8. Step A consists in expressing\n\u03a8 in terms of an auxiliary (bosonic) 4D quantity \u03a6 satisfying an equivalent\n(bosonic) 4D (Salpeter-like) equation. Step B involves a \" Gordon reduction\n\" to eliminate the \u03b3\u03bc matrices in favour of \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd matrices. Finally Step C consists in a 3D reduction of this 'bosonized' Master Equation, and a subsequent\nreconstruction of the original \u03a8 in 4D form by a suitable reversal of steps.\nIn the process a 3D scalar wave function \u03c6 is introduced which not only facilitates an explicit solution of the 3D (albeit fully covariant) Salpeter-like\nequation but is also a key component of the (reconstructed) 4D fermionic\nwave function \u03a8. To facilitate the process of 3D-4D interlinkage, a Green's\nfunction approach is employed a la [22], from which it is straightforward to\nderive the corresponding wave functions via the appropriate 'pole' limits.\nThe entire exercise involves a close correspondence between the (earlier) instantaneous form [22] and the (later) LF form [17], so as to project only the\nlatter by making free use of the results of the former. A new element will be\na generalization of the earlier formalism [22] so as to include the effect of the\n3-body force, Eq (1.2), on the structure of the qqq Green's function which\nwill require a more elaborate strategy, keeping in view the relative strengths\nof qq and qqq forces.\nAfter a short account of the correspondence between the instant and LF\nforms of the dynamics, Section 2 is devoted to Steps A and B for converting\nthe Master Equation for the actual 4D qqq wave function \u03a8 (fermionic) to\nan equivalent 4D (bosonic) form involving \u03a6, with all \u03b3-matrices eliminated\nin favour of Pauli matrices, by exploiting the effective 3D support for the\nqq and qqq kernels on the light-front, as described above. Section 3 describes the first part of Step C, viz., the use of Green\u2032 s- function method\nfor the 3D reduction of the Master Equation for the 4D Green's function\n5\n\n\fG corresponding to \u03a6, resulting in an integral equation for the 3D Green's\nfunction \u011c corresponding to phi, specialized to the large momentum regime\non the light-front. The second part of Step C, namely its reconstruction\nback to the 4D quantity G a la [22], leading to a formal connection between\n\u03a6 and \u03c6, is the subject of Section 4, now with the added complexity behind\nthe inclusion of the 3-body qqq force along with the (dominant) pairwise qq\nforces. [ The subsequent reconstruction of the 4D fermionic form \u03a8, follows\nfrom the results of Section 2]. As a further aid to the understanding of the\n3D-4D interconnection, Appendix A describes the complete procedure for a\nprototype qq subsystem, whose results are freely used for justifying several\nsteps in Sections 3 and 4. In Section 5, the full 3D BSE for \u03c6 is set up in\na simplified form designed to check for the dynamical effect of spin present\nin both the qq and qqq forces. on the structure of the differential equation\nfor \u03c6 (the dominant effect being of the latter ! ). Section 6 is devoted to\na short critique of the role of the Vqqq term on the analytic srtucture of the\nqqq wave function, while the derivation of the requisite QCD parameters for\nthe baryon from the f orward scattering amplitude off the i\u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 operator,\nvia the quark constituents, as well as a more elaborate 2-gluon contribution\nto the proton spin, is reserved for a subsequent paper.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSalpeter Eq on LF : From \u03a8 To \u03a6\nMaster Eq : Instant Vs LF Forms of Dynamics\n\nSince the first step in the formulation of a covariant Salpeter-like equation\non the light front (LF) is to establish a correspondence between the instant\nand LF forms of the dynamics, we first recall some definitions\n[17] for the\u221aLF\n\u221a\nquantities p\u00b1 = p0 \u00b1p3 defined covariantly as p+ = n.p 2 and p\u2212 = \u2212\u00f1.p 2.\nwhile the perpendicular components continue to be denoted by p\u22a5 in both\nnotations. Now for a typical internal momentum q\u03bc , the parallel component\nP.qP\u03bc /P 2 of the instant form translates in the LF form as q3\u03bc = zPn n\u03bc ,\n2\nwhere Pn = P.\u00f1, and z = n.q/n.P . As a check, q\u0302 2 = q\u22a5\n+ z 2 M 2 which shows\nthat zM plays the role of the third component of q\u0302 on LF. Next, we collect\nsome of the more important definitions / results of the LF formalism [17]\nq\u22a5 = q \u2212 qn n; q\u0302 = q\u22a5 + zPn n; z = q.n/P.n; qn = q.\u00f1;\nPn = P.\u00f1; P.q = Pn q.n + P.nqn ; q\u0302.\u00f1 = P\u22a5 .q\u22a5 = 0;\n6\n\n(2.1)\n\n\f2\nP.q\u0302 = Pn q.n; q\u0302 2 = q\u22a5\n+ M 2 z 2 ; P 2 = \u2212M 2\n\nFor a qqq baryon, there are two internal momenta, each separately satisfying\nthe relations\n(2.1). Note that for any 4-vector A, A.n and \u2212An correspond\n\u221a\nto 1/ 2 times the usual light front quantities A\u00b1 = A0 \u00b1 Az respectively.\nBut since a physical amplitude must not depend on the orientation n, a\nsimple device termed Lorentz \u2212 completion via the collinear trick [17] yields\na Lorentz-invariant amplitude for a transition process with three external\nlines P, P \u2032, P \u2032\u2032(= P +P \u2032) as follows. Since collinearity implies P\u22a5 .P\u22a5\u2032 = 0, the\n4-scalar product P.P \u2032 = P.nPn\u2032 +Pn P \u2032 .n+P\u22a5 .P\u22a5\u2032 simplifies to P.nPn\u2032 +Pn P \u2032.n.\nThen ' Lorentz completion ' simply amounts to reversing the last step via the\n'zero' quantity P\u22a5 .P\u22a5\u2032 , so as to recover the Lorentz invariant quantity P.P \u2032 at\nthe end ! And as a practical simplification, one does not even have to use the\nn, \u00f1 symbols; it suffices to use\n\u221a the more familiar light-front components A\u00b1\nfor the covariant quantities 2[A.n, \u2212An ] respectively. For ready reference,\nthe precise correspondence between the instant and LF definitions of the\n'parallel (z)' and 'time-like (0) ' components of the various 4- momenta for\na qqq baryon ( i = 1,2,3) [22, 23] :\npiz ; pi0 =\n\nMpi+ Mpi\u2212\n;\n;\nP+\n2P\u2212\n\np\u0302i \u2261 {pi\u22a5 , piz }\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe last part of Eq.(2.2) defines a covariant 3-vector on the LF that will\nfrequently appear in the reduced 3D BSE for the qqq proton. Our goal is\nto write down ( and solve) the Master equation for three fermion quarks\ncomplete with all internal d.o.f.'s, in the presence of both qq and direct qqq\nforces which reads [8] :\n\u03a8(p1 p2 p3 ) =\n\n3\nX\n1\n\nSF (p1 )SF (p2 )gs2\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\nd4 q12\n\u03b3 (1) \u03b3 (2) D\u03bc\u03bd (k12 )\u03a8(p\u20321 , p\u20322 , p3 )\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03bc \u03bd\n\n+SF (p1 )SF (p2 )SF (p3 )\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\nd4 q12\nd4 p\u20323\nVqqq \u03a8(p\u20321 p\u20322 p\u20323 )\n8\n(2\u03c0)\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the definitions for the various momenta, and the phase conventions for\nthe quark propagators are those of [8], while the direct 3-quark interaction\nVqqq in the last term is new, and given by (1.2). The central problem is now\nthe reduction of this Master equation (2.3) through the three steps (A, B,\nC) vide Sect (1.2), as outlined below.\n7\n\n\f2.2\n\nReduction of Master Eq from \u03a8 to \u03a6\n\nSince permutation symmetry plays a crucial role for a qqq hadron for fermion\nquarks, we define at the outset a pair of internal variables (\u03be; \u03b7) with, say,\nthe index #3 as basis, as [22]\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\u03be3 = p1 \u2212 p2 ;\n6\u03b73 = \u22122p3 + p1 + p2 ; P = p1 + p2 + p3\n(2.4)\nwhere the time-like and space- like parts of each are given by (2.2), and\nthe corresponding 3-vector defined as p\u0302i \u2261 {pi\u22a5 , piz }. Two identical sets of\nmomentum pairs \u03be1 , \u03b71 and \u03be2 , \u03b72 are similarly defined, but can be expressed\nin terms of the set (2.4) via permutation symmetry. Now Step A, which is\ndesigned to dispose of the fermion d.o.f.'s for a qqq system, consists in defining\nan auxiliary scalar function \u03a6 related to the actual BS wave function \u03a8 by\n[8]\n\u03a8 = \u03a0123 SF\u22121i (\u2212pi )\u03a6(pi p2 p3 )W (P )\n(2.5)\nHere the quantity W (P ) is independent of the internal momenta but includes\nthe spin-cum-flavour wave functions \u03c7, \u03c6 of the 3 quarks involved (see [?] :\n\u221a\n(2.6)\nW (P ) = [\u03c7\u2032 \u03c6\u2032 + \u03c7\u2032\u2032 \u03c6\u2032\u2032 ]/ 2\nwhere \u03c6\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 are the standard flavour functions of mixed symmetry [25] [not to\nbe confused with the 3D wave function \u03c6 !], and \u03c7\u2032 ,\u03c7\u2032\u2032 are the corresponding\nrelativistic spin functions. The latter may be defined either in terms of the\nquark # indices as in Eqs (1.2) or (2.3), or sometimes more conveniently in\na common Dirac matrix space as [24, 26]\n\u221a\n\u221a\nM \u2212 i\u03b3.P\n[i\u03b35 ; i\u03b3\u0302\u03bc / 3]C/ 2]\u03b2\u03b3 \u2297 [[1; \u03b35 \u03b3\u0302\u03bc ]u(P )]\u03b1\n(2.7)\n2M\nwhere the first factor is the \u03b2\u03b3-element of a 4 x 4 matrix in the joint spin\nspace of the quark #s 1, 2 [26], and the second factor the \u03b1 element of a 4\nx 1 spinor in the spin space of quark # 3; C is a charge conjugation matrix\nwith the properties [27]\n|\u03c7\u2032 >; |\u03c7\u2032\u2032 >= [\n\n\u2212\u03b3\u0303\u03bc = C \u22121 \u03b3\u03bc C; \u03b3\u03035 = C \u22121 \u03b35 C;\nand \u03b3\u0302\u03bc is the component of \u03b3\u03bc orthogonal to P\u03bc . Finally, the representations\nof the flavour functions \u03c6\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 satisfy the following relations in the \"3\" basis\n[28]\n1\n< \u03c6\u2032\u2032 |1; ~\u03c4 (3) |\u03c6\u2032\u2032 >=< \u03c6\u2032 |1; \u2212 ~\u03c4 (3) |\u03c6\u2032 >\n3\n8\n\n\f2.3\n\nGordon Reduction on Vqq3 & Vqqq\n\nAt this stage we indicate the effect of Gordon reduction on the pairwise\nkernels V (\u03be\u02c6i \u03b7\u0302i ) and the 3-body kernel Vqqq , following the original treatment of\n[29], (also quoted in [8] ). The strategy lies in a close scrutiny of Eqs.(2.3-2.5)\nwith a view to eliminate the Dirac matrices in favour of the Pauli matrices\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd . To that end, we express the Dirac propagators SF (pi ) as\niSF (pi ) = (mq \u2212 i\u03b3 (i) .pi )/\u2206i ;\n\n\u2206i = m2q + p2i\n\nNow employing the notation\n\nV\u03bc(i) = (mq \u2212 i\u03b3 (i) .pi )i\u03b3\u03bc(i)\n\n(2.8)\n\nthe result of Gordon reduction is expressed by the formula [29, 8]\n(1) (2)\n\n2\nV (1) .V (2) = \u2212M12\n\u2212(q\u0302+q\u0302 \u2032 )2 +i(q\u0302+q\u0302 \u2032 ).(\u03c3\u03021 +\u03c3\u03022 )\u00d7(q\u0302\u2212q\u0302 \u2032 )\u2212\u03c3ij \u03c3ik (q\u2212q \u2032 )j (q\u2212q \u2032 )k\n(2.9)\nwhere we have used a mixed vector-tensor notation for the various 3-vectors\non the light-front in the sense of (2.2) and a short-hand notation q for q12 . It\nis now possible to identify the pairwise kernel arising from the first group of\nterms on the rhs of Eq.(2. 3) after expressing it in LF notation of Eq.(2.2)\nas follows:\n\u22124\n1\nVqq3 \u2261 V (\u03be\u02c63 , \u03be\u02c63\u2032\u2032 ) = gs2 V (1) .V (2) \u00d7\n\u00d7\n(2.10)\n\u2032\u2032 2\n3\n(q\u030212 \u2212 q\u030212\n)\n\nwhere we have included a net color factor of (\u22124/3) arising from a folding\nof the factor F12 for each qq pair in a 3\u2217 state, into \u03bb3 /2 for the spectator\nquark # 3 in a 3 state; the corresponding gluon propagator has been taken\non the light-front, in the notation of (2.2). Similarly the 3-body kernel Vqqq\nin Eq.(2.3) may be identified as a sum of 3 terms arising from a folding of\n(1.2) with the 3 Dirac factors (mq \u2212 i\u03b3 (i) .pi ) in the second term of (2.3).\nVqqq =\n\n(\u22124/3)gs4 [V (1) .(k\u03022 \u2212 k\u03023 ) \u00d7 V (2) .V (3) + {2} + {3}]/{k\u030212 k\u030222 k\u030232 } (2.11)\n\nX\n123\n\nusing the notation V\u03bc(i) of (2.8). The net effect of the (antisymmetric) combination of the color matrices \u03bb is represented by the factor (\u22124/3) sitting\nin front; and ki = pi \u2212 p\u2032i . The 'bosonized' form of Eq.

And the Gordon reduction formula (2.9 ) may be repeatedly\nused to used to further simplify the structures of Vqq [Eq (2.10)] and Vqqq [ Eq.\n(2.12)], which are collected as follows.\n2.3.1\n\nFurther Reduction of Vqq3 & Vqqq\n\nThe 2-body and 3-body interactions are pictorially represented by fig 1(a)\nwhere the vertices of the triangle ABC stand for the position vectors (r1 , r2 , r3 )\nof the 3 quarks in configuration space, while the centroid O has the position\nvector R = ((r1 + r2 + r3 )/3. The corresponding momenta of the gluon\nlines connecting them for pairwise qq interactions are precisely the quantities qij \u2212 qij\u2032 that appear as arguments in Eq. (2.10), while the momenta\nassociated with the gluon lines connecting all the 3 quarks together, a la the\nY -shaped fig.(1b), are the quantities k\u0302i corresponding to the vectors (ri \u2212 R).\nIn the notation of Eq.(2.4), the former momenta are precisely \u03be\u02c6i , while the\nlatter are the dual variables \u03b7\u0302i . [This interpretation will prove useful in the\nsubsequent analysis].\nThe pairwise terms Vqqi were earlier considered in detail [8]. The 'con2\nvective' terms are of the form (p1 + p2 ).(p\u20321 + p\u20322 ) which simplifies to \u2212M12\n\u2248\n2\n\u22124M /9, plus smaller terms. The spin-orbit terms are unimportant for the\nground state of the qqq proton, but the spin-spin terms survive for its ground\nstate S = 1/2; their angular average works out as :\n2X\n1\n\u03c3\u0302i .\u03c3\u0302j = [\u03a32 \u2212 9]\n3 ij\n3\n10\n\n\fwhere we have introduced the total spin operator \u03a3 for the proton state, with\n\u03a32 = 3. Collecting these results the sum of the 3 pairwise interactions (2.10)\nwork out as\nX 4M 2 p3z\n8\nVqq3 = gs2 \u00d7 [\n\u2212 3p3z (\u03a32 \u2212 9)]\n(2.13)\n\u2032\u2032 2\n27\n(q\u030212 \u2212 q\u030212\n)\nWe now consider the more interesting term Vqqq , Eq.(2.12). The numerator\ncan be broken up into 3 distinct groups : a) convective; b) spin-orbit; c) spinsp[in-spin. Using the notation 2p\u0304i = pi +p\u2032i , the convective part vanishes (due\nto antisymmetry with too few d.o.f.'s) :\nX\n\n4[p\u03041 .p\u03042 ][2p\u03043 .(k1 \u2212 k2 )] \u21d2 0\n\nThe spin-orbit part comes from two groups of terms, one of which vanishes:\nX\n2p\u03041 .(k1 \u2212 k2 )[\u03c3\u03023 .( \u0304p\u03023 \u00d7 k\u03023 ) \u21d2 0\n\nwhere a mixed notation is used for the Pauli matrices, light-faced tensor for\nthe 4D and hatted vector for the 3D forms. The other group gives rise to a\nnon-zero contribution as\nX\nX\n4p\u03041 .p\u03042 [i\u03c3 (3) k3\u03bd (k1\u03bc \u2212 k2\u03bc )] \u2248 (\u22124iM 2 /9)\n\u03c3\u0302i .\u03be\u02c63 \u00d7 \u03b7\u03023\n(2.14)\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\ni\n\nin the notation of Eq.(2.4). Note the overall antisymmetry of the last factor\n(independent of the index 3).\nFinally the (totally antisymmetric) spin-spin-spin contribution SSS is\ndefined as :\nSSS =\n\nX\n123\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(1)\n[i\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\nk\u03021\u03bd (k\u03022\u03bc \u2212 k\u03023\u03bc )i\u03c3\u03bb\u03c1 k\u03022\u03c1 i\u03c3\u03bb\u03c3 k\u03023\u03c3\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe simplification of this expression (which is elementary) is helped by the\n(i)\nidentity \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u01eb\u03bc\u03bda \u03c3\u0302a(i) . The next step is angular averaging over each of the\nindependent 3-vectors involved in each of the three terms above, namely,\n< k\u0302i k\u0302j >= k\u0302 2 \u03b4ij /3. The resulting expression for SSS is\nSSS =\n\nX 1\n2i 2 2 2\n{k\u03021 k\u03022 k\u03023 }\u03c3\u03021 .\u03c3\u03022 \u00d7 \u03c3\u03023\n2\n9\ni k\u0302i\n\nSubstituting for SSS in Eq (2.11) and ignoring the spin-orbit terms (for the\nground state of the proton) the net 3-body force is\nVqqq =\n\nX 1\n\u22128igs4\n(\u03c3\u03021 .\u03c3\u03022 \u00d7 \u03c3\u03023 )\n2\n27\ni k\u0302i\n\n11\n\n(2.16)\n\n\f3\n\n3D Reduction By Green's Function Method\n\nWe are now in a position to implement Step C of our program ( establishing a\n3D-4D interconnection between the corresponding wave functions) , for which\nit is convenient to employ the Green's function approach [22]. Calling the\n4D Green's functions associated with \u03a8 and \u03a6 by GF and GS respectively,\nthe connection between them analogously to Eq.(2.5) may be written as\nGF (\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 ) = W (P ) \u2297 \u03a0123 SF\u22121i (\u2212pi )GS (\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 )\u03a0123 SF\u22121i (\u2212p\u2032i )W\u0304 (P \u2032) (3.1)\nwhere we have indicated the 4-momentum arguments of the Green's functions\ninvolved, in a common S3 basis (\u03be, \u03b7), and expressed the spin-flavour dependence of GF as a matrix product implied by the notation W (P ) \u2297 W\u0304 (P \u2032).\nNow to show the 3D-4D interconnection it is enough to work at the level\nof the 'scalar' Green's function GS ( relabelled as G for simplicity), since it is\ntrivial to include the spin-flavour d.o.f.'s in a matrix notation via (2.5) later.\nThe main steps for the scalar qqq Green's function are shown next, while\nAppendix A sketches the corresponding process for a typical qq subsystem,\nfrom 3D reduction to 4D reconstruction, so as to serve as a simpler prototype\nfor the actual qqq case.\n\n3.1\n\nReduction from 4D G(\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 ) to 3D \u011c(\u03be\u02c6\u03b7\u0302; \u03be\u0302 \u2032\u03b7\u0302 \u2032 )\n\nWe shall now outline a Green's function method to establish a 3D-4D interlinkage between the 4D \u03a6 and the 3D \u03c6, following a generalization of the\nprocedure developed some time ago [22], so as to include the effect of the\ndirect 3-body force Vqqq . To that end we shall rederive the qq denominator\nfunctions Dij of [22] arising from single integrations over d\u03bei0 , to show that\nthey are exactly proportional to the 3D denominator function D123 arising\nfrom a double integration over d\u03be0 d\u03b70 in the direct 3-body term to be considered here. [This is a big improvement over the earlier derivation [22] where\nthis property was missing, and helps pave the way for putting together the\neffects of both 2- and 3-body forces within a common dynamical framework\n].\nThe full 4D Green's function for 'scalar' quarks is G(\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 ) (taking out\nthe c.m \u03b4-fn), while its 3D counterpart \u011c is [22]\n\u011c(\u03be\u02c6\u03b7\u0302; \u03be\u02c6\u2032\u03b7\u0302 \u2032 ) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03be0 d\u03b70 d\u03be0\u2032 d\u03b70\u2032 G(\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 )\n12\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fwhere the time-like subscript '0' should be read as the corresponding LF\ncomponent in the sense of Eq.(2.2). Note that both G and \u011c are S3 symmetric, since the combination d\u03be0 d\u03b70 has this property. But the two hybrid\nGreen's functions defined as [22]\nG\u03033\u03be (\u03be\u02c63 \u03b73 ; \u03be\u02c63\u2032 \u03b73\u2032 ) =\nG\u03033\u03b7 (\u03be3 \u03b7\u03023 ; \u03be3\u2032 \u03b7\u03023\u2032 )\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\nd\u03be30 d\u03be30\nG(\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 );\n\u2032\nd\u03b730 d\u03b730\nG(\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 )\n\n(3.3)\n\nare not S3 symmetric (hence they are indexed), since the integration now\ninvolves only one of the two \u03be,\u03b7 variables.

(2.12) for the corresponding wave functions, except\nfor a change of variables wherein the factors 1/4 and 1/9 in the first and\nsecond groups of terms stem from the relations (2.4) among the corresponding\nvariables. It is understood that both these types of interaction have covariant\n3D support, and they incorporate the effect of 'Gordon reduction' as outlined\nin Sect 2.3 above. The 3D reduction of (3.4) is now achieved by integrating\nit a la (3.2), leading to a structure of the form :\n1\nd3 \u03be\u02c63\u2032\u2032 V (\u03be\u02c63 , \u03be\u02c63\u2032\u2032 )\u011c(\u03be\u02c63\u2032\u2032 \u03b7\u03023\u2032\u2032 ; \u03be\u02c63\u2032 \u03b7\u03023\u2032 )\n123 2 2D12\nZ\n1\nd3 \u03be \u2032\u2032 d3 \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 Vqqq \u011c(\u03be3\u2032\u2032\u03b73\u2032\u2032 ; \u03be3\u2032 \u03b73\u2032 ) (3.5)\n+ \u221a\n3\n3 3(2\u03c0) D123\n\n(2\u03c0)3 \u011c(\u03be\u02c6\u03b7\u0302; \u03be\u02c6\u2032\u03b7\u0302 \u2032 ) =\n\nX\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\nTo explain the structure of certain factors, Eq (3.5) shows that we have two\ntypes of 3D denominator functions Dij and D123 , associated with pairwise\n2-body and direct 3-body forces respectively. It is easily shown that they are\nsimply related to each other. To that end, Appendix A already shows the\nstructure of Dij :\nD12 =\n\nMD12+\n;\nP+\n\n2\n2\nD12+ = 2M[\u03c91\u22a5\np2+ + \u03c92\u22a5\np1+ \u2212 P12\u2212 p1+ p2+ ]\n\n13\n\n(3.6)\n\n\f2\nwhere \u03c9i\u22a5\nequals m2q + p2i\u22a5 . Using the on-shellness (\u22063 = 0) of the spectator\n2\n(#3) then gives P12\u2212 = P\u2212 \u2212 p3\u2212 which reduces further to P\u2212 \u2212 \u03c93\u22a5\n/p3+ . Its\nsubstitution back in (3.6) leads to the S3 symmetric result:\n\np3+ D12+\n\nX\nP+2\n2\n\u2261\n{p2+ p3+ \u03c91\u22a5\n} \u2212 2p1+ p2+ p3+ P\u2212\nD\n=\n2\n123\n2\n2M\n123\n\n(3.7)\n\nHere we have anticipated the structure of D123 associated with the Vqqq term\nwhose formal definition is\n1\n=\nD123\n\nZ\n\nP+2 dq12\u2212 dp3\u2212\n4M 2 (2i\u03c0)2 \u22061 \u22062 \u22063\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere the (double) contour integrations in the indicated variables leads to\nthe desired result.

Namely, in\nthe first group of terms the \u03b7 variable is the spectator since the integration is\nonly over the \u03be variable, while in the second group of terms, their relative roles\nare interchanged with the \u03be variable effectively a spectator ! This fact is not\nimmediately apparent because of the double integration involved, but a little\nreflection shows that the absence of the \u03be variable in (2.16) effectively ensures\nits spectator status in the argument of the corresponding Green's function.\nWe shall see this feature more clearly in the coordinate space representation\nof the \u03c6 equation (corresponding to Eq (3.9) for \u011c, to be considered in Section\n5. But first we turn our attention to the reconstruction of the 4D Green's\nfunction from the 3D form \u011c satisfying (3.9). To that end we note that\nthe qq and qqq group of terms in (3.9) need different strategies and are best\nhandled separately, one at a time, (temporarily) ignoring the presence of the\nother.\n\n14\n\n\f4\n\nReconstruction of 4D Wave Function\n\n4.1\n\nReconstruction of G with qq Forces Only\n\nConsidering first the qq group, we proceed exactly as in (A.10) of Appendix\nA for the qq system. Namely, first express G\u03033\u03b7 , eq.(3.3), in terms of the 3D\n\u011c, using the notation of (2.2) and the result of (3.7):\nG\u03033\u03b7 (\u03be3 \u03b7\u03023 ; \u03be3\u2032 \u03b7\u03023\u2032 ) =\n\n\u2032\nD123\nD123\n\u011c(\u03be\u02c6\u03b7\u0302; \u03be\u02c6\u2032 \u03b7\u0302 \u2032 )\n2i\u03c0p3z \u22061 \u22062\n2i\u03c0p\u20323z \u2206\u20321 \u2206\u20322\n\n(4.1)\n\nIn a similar way the fully 4D G function is expressible in terms of the hybrid\nfunction G\u03033\u03be as\nG(\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 ) =\n\nX\n123\n\n\u2032\nD123\nD123\nG\u03033\u03be (\u03be\u02c63 \u03b73 ; \u03be\u02c63\u2032 \u03b73\u2032 )\n2i\u03c0p3z \u22061 \u22062\n2i\u03c0p\u20323z \u2206\u20321 \u2206\u20322\n\n(4.2)\n\nNow since the G\u03033\u03be function is not determined from qqq dynamics alone, we\ninvoke an ansatz similar to, but more symmetrical than, [22] :\nG\u03033\u03be (\u03be\u02c63\u03b73 ; \u03be\u02c63\u2032 \u03b73\u2032 ) = \u011c(\u03be\u02c6\u03b7\u0302; \u03be\u0302 \u2032\u03b7\u0302 \u2032 )F (p3 , p\u20323 )\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere the balance of the p3 (spectator) dependence is in the (as yet unknown)\nF function, subject to an explicit self-consistency check. To that end, try\nthe ( symmetrical) Lorentz-invariant form\nF (p3 , p\u20323 ) =\n\nA3\n\u03b4(\u22063 \u2212 \u2206\u20323 )\n\u22063\n\n(4.4)\n\nand integrate both sides of (4.4) w.r.t. dp30 dp\u203230 , in the notation of (2.2),\nto show that the consistency check is met with the mass shell value of the\nspectator momentum :\n4p3z p\u20323z\nA3 =\n2i\u03c0\nSubstitution from A3 in (4.4) then gives the symmetrical form\nF (p3 , p\u20323 ) = 4p3z p\u20323z\n\n\u03b4(\u22063 \u2212 \u2206\u20323 )\n2\u03c0i\u22063\n\nwhence the 4D G-fn in terms of \u011c via the sequence (4.3) and (4.2), works\nout as\nX D123\nD\u2032\n\u03b4(\u22063 \u2212 \u2206\u20323 )\nq\nG(\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 ) =\n\u011c(\u03be\u02c6\u03b7\u0302; \u03be\u02c6\u2032 \u03b7\u0302 \u2032 ) \u2032 123\u2032 \u00d7\n(4.5)\n\u22061 \u22062 (2\u03c0i)5 \u22063 \u2206\u20323\n123 \u22061 \u22062\n15\n\n\f4.2\n\nReconstruction of G with qqq Forces Only\n\nNext we consider only the qqq group of terms for a reconstruction from \u011c (\nEq (3.5)) to G (Eq (3.4)). This case is more akin to the qq case of Appendix\nA in the sense that if we use the collective indices (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2261 \u03c1 and (\u03be \u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032) \u2261 \u03c1\u2032\nfor the initial and final state arguments of the G-function we can define two\nkinds of G\u0303 as follows.\nG\u0303(\u03c1\u0302; \u03c1\u2032 ) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c10 G(\u03c1; \u03c1\u2032 );\n\nG\u0303(\u03c1; \u03c1\u0302\u2032 ) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c1\u20320 G(\u03c1; \u03c1\u2032 )\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere the integrals on the RHS are each of the double integral type, so that\nthe definitions of the denominator functions involved are given by Eq.(3.8).\nThus, following (A. 9), G\u0303 and \u011c are connected as follows\nG\u0303(\u03c1, \u03c1\u0302\u2032 ) =\n\nD123 (\u03c1\u0302)\n\u011c(\u03c1\u0302; \u03c1\u0302\u2032 )\n(2i\u03c0)2 \u22061 \u22062 \u22063\n\n(4.7)\n\ntogether with a second one with the roles of \u03c1, \u03c1\u2032 interchanged. Continuing\nexactly as in Appendix A, G of Eq (3.4) gets expressed in terms of G\u0303 on\nthe RHS, since the interaction Vqqq does not involve the variables \u03c1\u20320 . Thence\nanother application of Eq.(4.7) for expressing G\u0303(\u03c1; \u03c1\u0302\u2032 ) in terms of \u011c finally\nyields the desired connection:\nG(\u03c1; \u03c1\u2032 ) =\n\nD123 (\u03c1\u0302\u2032 )\nD123 (\u03c1\u0302)\n\u2032\n\u011c(\u03c1\u0302;\n\u03c1\u0302\n)\n(2i\u03c0)2 \u22061 \u22062 \u22063\n(2i\u03c0)2 \u2206\u20321 \u2206\u20322 \u2206\u20323\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere the symbol \u03c1 stands collectively for (\u03be, \u03b7), as does \u03c1\u2032 . Note that in this\ncase the reconstruction of G in terms of of (the fully reduced) \u011c is unique,\nand does not require any extra ansatz like (4.4).\n\n4.3\n\nPutting Both Vqq & Vqqq Together\n\nWe have now two distinct types of 3D-4D interconnections valid for pure qq\nand pure qqq forces respectively. But when both types of forces are present,\nan exact interconnection is very difficult to derive. We shall therefore strive\nfor an approximate but sufficiently realistic solution based on the relative\nstrengths of the two forces, namely, an overwhelming preponderance of qq\nover qqq forces. To give effect to this strategy, we first note that the 3D\nlevel does not involve any approximation since Eq. (3.9) treats both types\nof interaction on par. It is only at the 4D level of reconstruction that an\n16\n\n\fapproximation is necessary for putting the two forces together. Now taking\naccount of the dominance of qq over qqq forces, the simplest choice is to\nprefer the structure of Eq (4.5) over that of Eq. (4.8). And although the\nratio of the two 3D-4D interconversion jackets in (4.5) over (4.8) is a singular\nquantity\nq\n\u2032\n\u03b4(\u22063 \u2212 \u22063 ) \u00d7 (2\u03c0i) \u22063 \u2206\u20323\n\nit causes no harm for physical amplitudes since such singular quantities get\nironed out on integration over the various momenta [23]. With this understanding, Eq.(4.5) represents the reconstruction of the full 4D Green's\nfunction G(\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 ) in terms of the 3D quantity \u011c(\u03be\u02c6\u03b7\u0302; \u03be\u02c6\u2032\u03b7\u0302 \u2032 ) where the latter\nnow satisfies Eq (3.9) which includes the effect of both qq and qqq forces.\n\n4.4\n\n3D-4D Interconnection for Wave Functions\n\nFinally the spectral representations of G(\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 ) and \u011c(\u03be\u02c6\u03b7\u0302; \u03be\u02c6\u2032 \u03b7\u0302 \u2032 ) for the qqq\nsystem, exactly on the lines of (A.12-A.13) for a qq subsystem near a bound\nstate pole P 2 = \u2212M 2 , are\nG(\u03be\u03b7; \u03be \u2032\u03b7 \u2032 ) =\n\nX\nn\n\n\u03a6n (\u03be, \u03b7)\u03a6\u2217n (\u03be \u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032)/(P 2 + M 2 );\n\n(4.9)\n\nand a similar equation for \u011c vis-a-vis \u03c6. These give the connection between\nthe 4D wave function \u03a6 which satisfies Eq (2.12), and the 3D wave function\n\u03c6 corresponding to the Green's function \u011c which satisfies (3.9). For purposes\nof evaluating transition amplitudes via Feynman diagrams, it is convenient\nto index \u03a6 as \u03a61 + \u03a62 + \u03a63 , and a corresponding indexing for the associated\nvertices as V = V1 + V2 + V3 , as in ref [22], so as to keep track of which\nquark is involved in which vertex.\n\u03a63 (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2261\n\nq\n\n\u03b4(\u22063 )\nD123 \u02c6\nV3\n\u221a\n=\n\u03c6(\u03be, \u03b7\u0302)\n\u22061 \u22062 \u22063\n\u22061 \u22062\n(2\u03c0i)5/2 \u22063\n\n(4.10)\n\nThe \u03b4-function in eq.(4.7) has nothing to do with any connectedness problem;\nsee ref.[22] for detailed reasons.

Further information on the singularity of the differential equation (at points other than R = 0) hinges on the nature of the eigenvalues of\nthe spin operator A which appears in above multiplying factor. Now these\neigenvalues are given by (5.8), two of which are complex for the state of the\nproton (\u03a32 = 3), but the other two are real. Of the real solutions the positive\neigenvalue does not yield a zero in this multiplying factor but the negative\neigenvalue (\u2248 \u22124) does give a zero for a real value of R at a point X02 between\nX 2 = 0 and X 2 = \u221e :\ns\n\u221a\n\u221a\nA\u03b12\n\u03b1s 2\nA\u03b1s2\n\u03b1s 2\n2\n(5.15)\nX0 \u2212\nX0 + \u221a = 0; X0 = +\n\u00b1 [\u03b1s2 /32 \u2212 \u221a s ]\n4\n8\n3\n3\nwhere the value of \u03a32 = 3 for the proton state has been substituted. Indeed\nthis zero ( for A \u2248 \u22124) is a key element of the dynamical effect of the spin\n- rich 3-body force term, although the spin effect of the 2-body Vqq term is\nmarginal.\nTo study this effect more quantitatively, we seek an approximate solution\nof Eq. (5.14) in the neighbourhood of the zero at (5.15) for which a crude numerical estimate suggests the following location. Taking a 3-flavour structure\n\u03b1s = 2\u03c0/[9 ln M/\u039b], with \u039b \u2248 150MeV , one finds \u03b1s \u2248 0.39, whence\nX0 \u2248 0.0689 \u00b1 X1 ;\n21\n\nX1 \u2261 0.5841\n\n\fThis shows that the qq term gives \u223c 10% shift around the central value of\nX1 , which corresponds to R \u2248 0.12f m, and is almost entirely due to the spin\neffect of the Vqqq term. Therefore in the spirit of this qualitative investigation,\nit makes sense to drop this 10% effect, in which case Eq (5.14) simplifies to\n\u221a\nX12 2\n5\n2\u03b1s 2\n[1 \u2212 2 ](\u2202X + \u2202X )\u03c6 +\n\u03c6 = 0; X1 = 0.584\n(5.16)\nX\nX\n3X\nTo bring it nearer to a standard form, transform to the independent variable\nz according to zX02 = X02 \u2212 X 2 , which yields\n\u221a\n\u03b1s\nz(1 \u2212 z)\u2202z2 \u03c6 \u2212 3z\u2202z \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b2 1 \u2212 z\u03c6 = 0; \u03b2 \u2261 \u221a X1 \u2248 0.058\n(5.17)\n3 2\nThis equation is almost (not quite) of the hypergeometric form but it can be\nreduced to a standard one (with singularities located at z = 0, 1, \u221e) [32] by\nexploiting the smallness ( \u03b2 = 0.058 ) of the last term to replace it with a\nconstant ( with value corresponding to z = 1/2) :\n\u03b2\n(5.18)\nz(1 \u2212 z)\u2202z2 \u03c6 \u2212 3z\u2202z \u03c6 \u2212 \u221a \u03c6 = 0\n2\nAn equivalent equation may be obtained with the transformation z = 1 \u2212 x :\n\n\u03b2\nx(1 \u2212 x)\u2202x2 \u03c6 + 3(1 \u2212 x)\u2202x \u03c6 \u2212 \u221a \u03c6 = 0\n(5.19)\n2\nwhere x = 1 corresponds to the location X = X1 of the singularity, as\nindicated in Eq. (5.16). [ Note that this singularity corresponds to the\nnegative eigenvalue of A, thus reflecting the dynamical effect of the spin-rich\nVqqq term, while a positive or complex eigenvalue of A would result in the\ndisappearance of this singularity ]. The solution of Eq.(5.19) is then given\nby [32]\n\u03b2\n(5.20)\n\u03c6 = F (a, b|3|x); a + b = 2; ab = \u221a\n2\nwith the entire machinery of hypergeometric functions available [32] for exploring its properties according to need. The scaled variable x is related to\nthe 6D distance R by MR = X1 x where X1 \u2248 1.5\u03b1s is directly related to\nthe location of the singularity induced by the spin structure of the Y-shaped\n3-body force . And the reconstruction of the full Bethe Salpeter wave function \u03a8 as a sum of 3 pieces \u03a8i is now only a matter of substituting (5.20) in\n(4.11), whence the corresponding vertex functions Vi are immediately identified [22, 23] for specific transition amplitudes a la Feynman diagrams.\n22\n\n\f6\n\nRetrospect : Critique Of The 3-Body Force\n\nIn retrospect, we have considered, in conjunction with pairwise qq forces, the\neffect of a new type of 3-body force Vqqq , rich in spin content, on the analytical structure of the qqq wave function in the high momentum regime of\nQCD where the confining interaction is unimportant, rendering the dominant\nforce Coulombic. As to the anatomy of this (spin-rich) Vqqq , we have taken\nit to be generated by a ggg vertex ( a genuine part of the QCD Lagrangian\n) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on as many quark lines, giving rise\nto a (Mercedes-Benz type) Y -shaped diagram, a la fig 1. From a physical\npoint of view it is natural to expect that such a spin-rich structure should\nplay a potentially crucial role in the so-called 'spin anomaly' of the proton,\na subject that seems once again to have raised its head in the context of new\npolarized beam techniques now available [5] for resolving the issue experimentally. With that end in view, our strategy has been to determine the\ndynamical effect of the spin dependence of Vqq and Vqqq forces on the analytical structure of the internal 3D wave function \u03c6. [It is emphasized that\nthis effect must be carefully distinguished from the \" kinematical \" effect of\nspin, which manifests in several other ways, namely through the presence of\nvarious \u03b3 matrices that appear in equations like (4.11) connecting \u03c6 to the\nfull 4D wave function \u03a8]. Indeed we found in Section 5 that while the spindynamical effect of 2-body forces is marginal, that of the spin-rich 3-body\nforce is quite pronounced, and shows up through the possible \" eigenvalues\n\", Eq (5.7), of the spin operator (i\u03c31 .\u03c32 \u00d7 \u03c33 ) which is a part of Vqqq : only\na negative eigenvalue (there is only one !), induces a singularity in the differential equation for \u03c6, but not others. The resulting dynamical effect is\nexpressed by a hypergeometric function, Eq.(5.20), which gets folded into\nthe 4D BS amplitude \u03a8 via Eq.(4.11), thus fulfilling the original (limited)\nmotivation behind this study.\nUnfortunately, the dynamical framework underlying the contents of this\npaper has had a long history born out of the author's long involvement with\nthe so-called Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE), often with extended periods of\nstalemate (and frustration !), but mostly centred around the quest for a satisfactory definition of probability within the BSE framework. Eventually it\nbecame possible to settle for a toned down version of BSE, that of a Salpeterlike equation ( 3D support for the kernel), which is amenable to a probability\ninterpretation at the 3D level. And its 4D features, although present in the\noriginal formulation itself [6], had for decades remained hidden from view, but\n23\n\n\fwere finally dug out [7] in the context of an independent approach designed to\nexplore a 3D-4D interconnection between the corresponding BS amplitudes\nwhen the kernel has a 3D support [8]. Further, the lack of covariance in the\noriginal formulation [6] was subsequently remedied via a special (instantaneous) frame of reference in which the composite hadron of 4-momentum P\u03bc\nis at rest [33]. This result turned out to be in conformity with the MarkovYukawa Transversality Principle (MYTP) [11, 12], which happens to be a\n'gauge principle' in disguise [13] : It ensures that the interactions among the\nconstituents be transverse to the direction of P\u03bc . Subsequent refinements\nhave been mostly technical , especially the use of Dirac's light-front formulation so as to extend the dynamical range of validity of the BS framework by\novercoming certain practical problems like 'Lorentz mismatch disease' [17]\nassociated with different vertices of a given Feynman diagram.\nIt therefore looked worthwhile to employ this old-fashioned formalism\nin the present context of a new kind of 3-body force Vqqq , with enough details put in for a reasonably self-contained description without having to dig\nfrequently into the original sources. This has also given an opportunity to\nmake several refinements, especially the derivation of a common denominator function associated with both the qq and qqq forces and extending the\nearlier formalism to accommodate the Vqqq force, for which this theoretical\nframework seems to be well suited.\nThe next part of this programme involves the derivation of the requisite QCD parameters for the baryon spin, for which some key ingredients\nare i) the f orward scattering amplitude off the i\u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 operator, inserted at\nthe individual quark lines, and ii) a more elaborate 2-gluon contribution to\nthe proton spin, which is reserved for a subsequent paper within the same\nformalism.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSeveral colleagues have contributed to the evolution of the BS formalism,\nwith and without active authorships, and the present paper also shares the\ngeneral acknowledgement.

Now define the hybrid\nGreen's functions [22]:\nG\u0303(q\u0302, q \u2032 ) =\n\nZ\n\ndq0 G(q, q \u2032 ; P );\n\nG\u0303(q, q\u0302 \u2032) =\n25\n\nZ\n\ndq0\u2032 G(q, q \u2032; P )\n\n(A.6)\n\n\fUsing (A.6) on the RHS of (A.1) gives\n1\n(2\u03c0) iG(q, q ; P ) =\n\u22061 \u22062\n4\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nd3 q\u0302 \u2032\u2032 V (q\u0302, q\u0302 \u2032\u2032 )G\u0303(q\u0302 \u2032\u2032 , q \u2032 )\n\n(A.7)\n\nIntegrating (A.1) w.r.t. dq0\u2032 only, and using (2.7) again, gives\n1 Z 3 \u2032\u2032\n(2\u03c0) iG\u0303(q, q\u0302 ) =\nd q\u0302 V (q\u0302, q\u0302 \u2032\u2032 )\u011c(q\u0302 \u2032\u2032 , q\u0302 \u2032 )\n\u22061 \u22062\n4\n\n\u2032\n\n(A.8)\n\nFrom (A.8) and (A.3), G\u0303 and \u011c are connected as:\nG\u0303(q, q\u0302 \u2032 ) =\n\nD(q\u0302)\n\u011c(q\u0302, q\u0302 \u2032 )\n2i\u03c0\u22061 \u22062\n\n(A.9)\n\nInterchanging q and q \u2032 in (A.9) gives the dual result\nG\u0303(q\u0302, q \u2032 ) =\n\nD(q\u0302 \u2032 )\n\u011c(q\u0302, q\u0302 \u2032 )\n2i\u03c0\u2206\u20321 \u2206\u20322\n\n(A.10)\n\nSubstitution in (A.7) gives the desired 3D-4D interconnection\nG(q, q \u2032 ; P ) =\n\nD(q\u0302 \u2032 )\nD(q\u0302)\n\u011c(q\u0302, q\u0302 \u2032 ; P )\n2i\u03c0\u22061 \u22062\n2i\u03c0\u2206\u20321 \u2206\u20322\n\n(A.11)\n\nNext, spectral representations for the 4D and 3D G-fns in (A.11) give [22]\nG(q, q \u2032; P ) =\n\nX\n\n\u03a6n (q; P )\u03a6\u2217n (q \u2032 ; P )/(P 2 + M 2 );\n\n(A.12)\n\nn\n\n\u011c(q\u0302, q\u0302 \u2032 ) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6n (q\u0302)\u03c6\u2217n (q\u0302 \u2032 )/(P 2 + M 2 )\n\n(A.13)\n\nn\n\nwhere \u03a6n and \u03c6n are 4D and 3D wave functions, so that their interconnection\n(valid for any bound state n), is expressed by:\n\u0393(q\u0302) \u2261 \u22061 \u22062 \u03a6(q; P ) =\n\nD(q\u0302)\u03c6(q\u0302)\n2i\u03c0\n\n(A.14)\n\nwhich tells us that the covariant vertex function \u0393 on the light-front is a\nfunction of q\u0302 only [22] via its definition (2.2). This derivation is a prototype\nfor the qqq case of text.\n\n26\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Ernest Ma, Phys. Rev.D12, 2105 (1975).\n[2] B. McKellar, private communication ; 1994.\n[3] A. N. Mitra, Phys Rev.
