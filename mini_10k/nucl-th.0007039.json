In the\nnuclear structure jargon one calls realistic those interactions whose parameters have been\nfixed to reproduce the properties of two, and eventually three, nucleon systems.\nA large number of theories has been developed to tackle the problem of solving the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation with realistic interactions. Three or four nucleon systems are described\nwith Faddeev [1, 2], Correlated Hyperspherical Harmonics Expansion [3, 4] and Green Function Monte Carlo [5] techniques which solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation without approximations. The Green Function Monte Carlo technique has also been applied, with great success,\nto nuclei up to A=7 [5].\nMainly for computational reasons, the straightforward applications of the above theories\nto heavier nuclear systems is not affordable, therefore different approaches such as Cluster\nMonte Carlo [6], Brueckner theory [7], Exponential S [8], Correlated Basis Function (CBF)\n[9], have been developed with the aim of obtaining approximate, but still accurate, solutions\nof the many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nAmong these theories the CBF [10] has been well tested and widely applied in infinite\nnuclear systems like nuclear and neutron matter [11]-[13]. These studies have shown that,\nin the framework of the CBF theory, the Fermi Hypernetted Chain (FHNC) resummation\ntechnique with the Single Operator Chain (SOC) approximation provides solutions of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation having an accuracy of about 1 MeV per nucleon on the binding energy.\nIn this computational scheme the use of Argonne nucleon-nucleon potentials [14, 15], together\nwith Urbana three-body forces [16], provides equations of state whose minima are rather close\n\n1\n\n\fto the empirical one. In the same framework also the nuclear matter responses to external\nprobes have been calculated obtaining satisfactory agreement with experimental inelastic\nelectron scattering data [17, 18].\nThe success of the infinite nuclear matter results has lead one to apply the CBF theory to\nthe description of the ground state of finite nuclear systems. Recently, 16 O and 40 Ca ground\nstates have been described within the FHNC-SOC computational scheme with interactions\nincluding tensor, spin-orbit terms and three-body forces [9].\nIn this paper we deal with the problem of describing excited states of finite nuclei within\nthe CBF computational scheme. The model we present is inspired by the nuclear matter\nworks of Refs. [17, 18]. While in these works the CBF cluster expansion has been fully\nconsidered, in our model we retain only those terms containing a single correlation function.\nThe validity of this truncation has been tested, for the nuclear matter charge response, in\nRef. [19]. Because of the excellent agreement between the full calculation and our truncated\nmodel we felt confident enough to extend our model to include the current operators.\nOur model treats the short-range correlations but does not consider collective nuclear\nexcitations. For this reason we have applied it to the description of the nuclear responses in\nthe quasi-elastic region where the collective effects are negligible [20, 21].\nIn this paper we shall deal only with inclusive electron scattering data, and we consider\nexcited states with both one and two particles in the continuum. The two nucleon emission\nis treated as a genuine short-range correlation effect, and we neglect the contribution of the\ntwo-body currents.\nAfter briefly reviewing in section 2 the approach of Ref. [17], we present in section 3 our\nmodel, and we apply it in section 4 to inclusive electron scattering. The results obtained in\nthe calculations of the 16 O and 40 Ca quasi-elastic responses are presented in section 5. In\nsection 6 we summarize our work and we draw our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nResponses in a correlated theory\n\nThe linear response of a many-body system to the perturbations induced by an external\noperator O(q) is given by:\n1\n(1)\nS(q, \u03c9) = \u2212 Im D(q, \u03c9) ,\n\u03c0\nwith\n\u223c\n\u223c\nD(q, \u03c9) = h\u03a80 | O + (q) (H \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03c9 + i\u03b7)\u22121 O(q) | \u03a80 i ,\n(2)\n\u223c\n\nwhere we have indicated with | \u03a8n i the normalized eigenstates of the nuclear hamiltonian H:\n|\u03a8n i\n\n\u223c\n\n| \u03a8n i =\n\n1\n\nh\u03a8n |\u03a8n i 2\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\n\fIn the previous equations q and \u03c9 represent the momentum and energy transferred to the\nnucleus.\nInserting in Eq. (2) a complete set of eigenvectors of H we obtain:\n\u223c\n\nD(q, \u03c9) =\n\n\u223c\n\nX |h\u03a8n | O(q) | \u03a80 i|2\nn\n\nEn \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03c9 + i\u03b7\n\nwhere we have defined:\n\u03ben (q) =\n\nX\n\n=\n\nn\n\n\u03ben+ (q) (En \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03c9 + i\u03b7)\u22121 \u03ben (q) ,\n\nh\u03a8n | O(q) |\u03a80 i\n1\n\n1\n\nh\u03a8n |\u03a8n i 2 h\u03a80 |\u03a80 i 2\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nLike in CBF theory we assume that the nuclear many-body ground state is described as\na product of a correlation function G and a Slater determinant |\u03a60 i of a set of single particle\nwave functions occupying all, and only, the states below the Fermi surface:\n|\u03a80 i = G |\u03a60 i .\n\n(6)\n\nSince the Slater determinant is already antisymmetrized with respect to the exchange of two\nnucleons, the correlation operator is given by a symmetrized product of two-body correlation\noperators:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nG(1, 2...A) = S \uf8f0\n\nY\n\ni<j\n\nFij \uf8fb ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we have indicated with S the symmetrizer operator.\nIn modern nuclear structure calculations with realistic microscopic interactions, the twobody correlation operator is taken as a sum of operator dependent correlation functions\nFij =\n\nX\n\np\nf p (rij ) Oij\n,\n\n(8)\n\np=1,8\n\nwhere the involved operators are:\np=1,8\nOij\n= [1, \u03c3 i * \u03c3 j , Sij , (L * S)ij ] \u2297 [1, \u03c4 i * \u03c4 j ] ,\n\n(9)\n\nwith Sij = (3 r\u0302ij * \u03c3 i r\u0302ij * \u03c3 j \u2212 \u03c3 i * \u03c3 j ) indicating the tensor operator, and rij = |ri \u2212 rj | the\ndistance between the positions of the particles i and j.\nThe ground state wave function is obtained by minimizing the ground state energy with\nrespect to variations of the correlation function and of the single particle basis. In the theory\ndeveloped in Ref. [17], the correlation operator G whose parameters have been fixed by the\nground state minimization is used to generate the excited states of the system:\n|\u03a8n i = G |\u03a6n i .\n\n3\n\n(10)\n\n\fThe mean-field excited states |\u03a6n i are obtained by making particle-hole excitations on |\u03a60 i.\nIn order to use the cluster expansion techniques it is useful to rewrite the function \u03ben (q)\nas:\n\"\n#1\nh\u03a6n | G+ O(q) G|\u03a60 i h\u03a60 | G+ G |\u03a60 i 2\n.\n(11)\n\u03ben (q) =\nh\u03a60 | G+ G |\u03a60 i\nh\u03a6n | G+ G |\u03a6n i\nThe two factors in Eq. (11) are evaluated separately by expanding the numerator and the\ndenominator in powers of the short-range function Fij \u2212 1 (see Ref. [17] for a detailed\npresentation of the cluster expansion of \u03ben (q)). In both factors the denominators cancel the\nunlinked diagrams.\n\n3\n\nThe model\n\nOur model simplifies the calculation of the cluster expansion of Eq. (11) by retaining only\nthose terms involving a single correlation line. This model has been inspired by the results of\nRefs. [27, 28] where the density and momentum distributions of doubly closed shell nuclei,\ncalculated with a single correlation line model, have been shown to be rather similar to those\nobtained with complete CBF/FHNC calculations.\nIn the present article we consider that the external operator O(q) is a one-body operator\np\nand we use only scalar correlations. Considering Oij\n= 0 for p > 1 in Eq. (9), we can express\nthe function \u03ben (q) as:\n\u03ben (q) =\n=\n\nh\u03a6n |\n\nQ\n\ni<j\n\nh\u03a60 |\n\nQ\n\nfij+ O(q)\n\n+\ni<j fij\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\ni<j\n\ni<j\n\nfij |\u03a60 i\n\nfij |\u03a60 i\n\nh\u03a6n | O(q) i<j (1 + hij ) |\u03a60 i\nQ\nh\u03a60 | i<j (1 + hij ) |\u03a60 i\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\nh\u03a60 |\n\nh\u03a6n |\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\ni<j\n\nfij+\n\n+\ni<j fij\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\ni<j\ni<j\n\nfij |\u03a60 i\n\nfij |\u03a6n i\n\nh\u03a60 | i<j (1 + hij ) |\u03a60 i\nQ\nh\u03a6n | i<j (1 + hij ) |\u03a6n i\n\n#1\n\n#1\n2\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we have considered that fij is a real scalar function, therefore commuting with the\noperator O(q), and we have defined hij = fij2 \u2212 1.\nThe approximation of our model consists in retaining in Eq.(12) only those diagrams\nhaving a single h function:\n\u03ben (q) \u2192 \u03ben1 (q) = h\u03a6n | O(q)\n\nX\ni<j\n\n(1 + hij ) |\u03a60 iL ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the subindex L indicates that only the linked diagrams are considered. This result has\nbeen obtained using the same procedure used in Ref. [27] for the density distribution.

The\nsymbols have the same meaning as in Fig. 1.\n\n6\n\n\fthis allows the elimination of the unlinked diagrams. Only at this point do we truncate the\nobtained result by considering only the first order terms in hij .\nThe terms contributing to \u03ben1 (q) are presented as Mayer-like diagrams in Figs. 1 and\n2 for 1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations respectively. In each diagram, the black square indicates\nthe coordinate where the excitation one-body operator O(q) is acting, while the black dots\nindicate the other coordinates. The dashed line indicates the correlation function h, which\noperates on two-coordinates only, and the continuous oriented lines indicate the single particle\nwave functions \u03c6. We have used the convention of considering entering into a point the wave\nfunctions of the state |\u03a6i, while the wave functions of the state h\u03a6| are exiting from the point.\nThe letters i, j, k indicate single particle wave functions below the Fermi surface and imply a\nsummation over them. With p and h we have labelled those particle and hole states whose\nquantum numbers characterize the full many-body excited state.\nLet us first consider the case when the nuclear final states have only one particle in the\ncontinuum. If we label with 1 the coordinate where the external operator O(q) is acting, we\ncan specify the \u03be 1 in Eq. (13) as:\n1\n(q)\n\u03be1p1h\n\n=\n\nh\u03a61p1h | O(q) |\u03a60 i + h\u03a61p1h | O(q)\n+ h\u03a61p1h | O(q)\n\nA\nX\n\n1<i<j\n\nA\nX\n\nj>1\n\nh1j |\u03a60 i\n\nhij |\u03a60 i .\n\n(14)\n\nThe above expression shows that our model, in addition to the uncorrelated transitions\nrepresented by the the one-point diagram (1.1) in Fig. 1, generates also two- and three-point\ndiagrams. The presence of both two- and three-point diagrams is necessary to have a correct\nnormalization of the many body wave function. This can be seen by considering that, if O(q)\nis the density operator, in the limit for q \u2192 0, when p = h, the sum on all the hole single\nparticle wave functions should provide the proper number of nucleons A, as happens in Refs.\n[27, 28]. In this limit, the diagrams containing a correlation line should not contribute. This\ncan be seen in Fig. 1, by joining the p and h lines and considering that in the three-point\ndiagrams the q \u2192 0 limit implies that the wave functions linked to the black square should\nbe equal because of the orthonormality of the set of single particle wave functions. One can\nthen observe that the contribution of the (2.1) and (2.3) diagrams is exactly canceled by that\nof the (3.2), (3.4) and (3.6) diagrams, and the contribution of the (2.2) and (2.4) diagrams\nis canceled by that of the (3.1), (3.3) and (3.5) diagrams.\nWhen the nuclear final state is characterized by two-particle two-hole excitations, the\nfunction \u03ben1 (q) is given by:\n1\n\u03be2p2h\n(q) = h\u03a62p2h | O(q)\n\nA\nX\n\n1<j\n\nh1j |\u03a60 i + h\u03a62p2h |O( q)\n\n7\n\nA\nX\n\n1<i<j\n\nhij |\u03a60 i .\n\n(15)\n\n\fAs expected, the uncorrelated term does not appear, since a one-body operator cannot\nlead to a 2p-2h final state. The 4 two-point diagrams and the 12 three-point diagrams we\nconsider are shown in Fig. 2. Also in this case the set of diagrams conserves the proper\nnormalization. In analogy with the discussion done for the 1p-1h case one can see that, in\nthe limit q \u2192 0 and setting p1 = h1 and p2 = h2 the contribution of the diagrams of Fig. 2\nis zero, as expected.\n\n4\n\nElectromagnetic excitations\n\nThe response model presented in the previous sections has been applied to the description of\ninclusive electron scattering processes considering both one- and two- nucleon emission.\nIn Plane Wave Born Approximation, the inclusive electron scattering cross section can\nbe written as:\nd2 \u03c3\nd\u03a9\u2032 d\u01eb\u2032\n\n= \u03c3M\n\n(\n\ni\nq\u03bc4 h 1p1h\n2p2h\nR\n(q,\n\u03c9)\n+\nR\n(q,\n\u03c9)\nL\nL\nq4\n\nq\u03bc2\n\u03b8\n\u2212 2\n+ tan\n2 2q\n2\n\n!\n\nh\n\nRT1p1h (q, \u03c9)\n\n+\n\ni\n\nRT2p2h (q, \u03c9)\n\n)\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the scattering angle, q \u03bc the four-momentum transfer satisfying the relation q\u03bc2 =\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 q2 , and \u03c3M is the Mott cross section:\n\u03c3M =\n\n\u03b1 cos(\u03b8/2)\n2\u01ebi sin2 (\u03b8/2)\n\n!2\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nIn the last equation \u03b1 is the fine structure constant and \u01ebi is the initial energy of the electron.\nThe electromagnetic responses RL and RT , depending on q \u2261 |q| and \u03c9, are obtained\nby evaluating the responses S(q, \u03c9) in Eq. (1) for charge and current operators respectively,\nand multiplying them by the electromagnetic nucleon form factors. In Eq. (16) the 1p-1h\nand 2p-2h responses do not interfere with each other because they produce two different final\nstates.\nWe have calculated the longitudinal responses using the charge operator:\nO(q) \u2192 \u03c1(q) =\nwith\n\u03c1(r) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 r eiq*r \u03c1(r) ,\n\nA\nX\n1 + \u03c43 (k)\n\nk=1\n\n2\n\n8\n\n\u03b4(r \u2212 rk ) ,\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\n\fwhere \u03c43 (k) is the third component of the isospin of the k-th nucleon.\nThe transverse responses have been calculated considering convection and magnetization\ncurrents:\nZ\nc\nm\nO(q) \u2192 J(q) = j (q) + j (q) =\nd3 r eiq*r [ jc (r) + jm (r) ],\n(20)\n\nwith\n\njc (r) =\n\nA\nX\n\nk=1\n\nand\nm\n\nj (r) =\n\nA\nX\n\nk=1\n\n1\nMk\n\n1 1 + \u03c43 (k)\n[\u03b4(r \u2212 rk ) \u2207k + \u2207k \u03b4(r \u2212 rk )]\ni2Mk\n2\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c43 (k)\n1 + \u03c43 (k)\n+ \u03bcN\n\u03bcP\n2\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2207k \u00d7 \u03b4(r \u2212 rk ) \u03c3(k) .\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nIn the above equation we have indicated with Mk and \u03c3(k) the mass and Pauli spin matrices corresponding to the k-th nucleon, and with \u03bcP (\u03bcN ) the proton (neutron) anomalous\nmagnetic moment.\nSince in the quasi-elastic peak the contribution of jc is small compared to that of jm (see\nthe discussion of Fig. 5 in the next section) we have considered the convection current only\nin the uncorrelated one-body term (1.1) of Fig. 1.\nWe restrict our study to the investigation of doubly closed shell nuclei and we suppose that\nthe target nucleus makes a transition from its ground state to an excited state characterized\nby the total angular momentum J, its projection M on the quantization axis, and the parity\n\u03a0 = \u00b11. The responses can be written as:\nRL (q, \u03c9) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nJ,M\n\n1\n2\n|h\u03a8\u03a0\nJM | MJM (q) |\u03a800 i| \u03b4(EJ \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03c9)\n\n(23)\n\nand\nRT (q, \u03c9) =\n\n\u221e n\nX\n\nJ,M\n\no\n\nE\n1\n2\n\u03a0\nM\n1\n2\n|h\u03a8\u03a0\n\u03b4(EJ \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03c9) , (24)\nJM | TJM (q) |\u03a800 i| + |h\u03a8JM | TJM (q) |\u03a800 i|\n\nwhere we have not indicated the parity of the ground state which is always positive in our\ncase. The MJM and TJM operators used in the previous equations are obtained by making\na multipole expansion of Eqs. (18) and (20).

(28) and (29) show that the final state quantum numbers are determined by the\nquantum numbers of the uncorrelated many body state |\u03a6\u03a0\nJM i which is built as a Slater\ndeterminant of single particle wave functions of the form:\nt\n\u03c6k (r) \u2261 Rnlj\n(r)\n\nX\n\u03bcs\n\n1\nhl\u03bc s|jmi Yl\u03bc (r\u0302) \u03c7s \u03c7t ,\n2\n\n10\n\n(32)\n\n\fwhere \u03c7s and \u03c7t are the spin and isospin wave functions respectively and hl\u03bc 12 s|jmi a ClebschGordan coefficient.\nWe treat now separately the one and two nucleon emission cases. In the first one, once the\nhole is fixed, energy conservation defines the value of the emitted particle energy: \u01ebp = \u03c9 + \u01ebh.\nThe angular momentum coupled Slater determinant is related to the uncoupled one by the\nrelation:\nX\n|\u03a6\u03a0\n(\u22121)jh \u2212mh hjp mp jh \u2212 mh |JM i |\u03a6\u03a0\n(33)\nJM (1p1h)i =\n1p1h i ,\nmp mh\n\nwhere jp and jh are the particle and hole angular momenta and mp and mh their third\ncomponents. We insert the expression (33) into Eq. (14) and apply the Wigner-Eckart\ntheorem. Using the orthornormality of the single particle wave functions we obtain the\nfollowing expression:\n1,J\n(q)\n\u03be1p1h\n\n= hpk OJ (q) khi +\n\nA\nX\nj\n\nhpjk OJ (q) h12 khji +\n\nA\nX\nj,k\n\nhpjkk OJ (q) h23 khjki .\n\n(34)\n\nIn this equation we have labelled with 1 the coordinate where the electromagnetic one-body\noperator is acting. The second and the third terms of Eq. (34) produce the two- and threepoint diagrams of Fig. 1 respectively.\nThe multipole expanded expression of a generic one-body operator is formed by the\nproduct of a term depending on q and r1 multiplied by a term depending only on the angular\ncoordinates:\nOJM (q) = FJ (qr1 )OJM (r\u03021 ).\n(35)\nIn the case we are interested this is obtained by inserting the expressions (19), (21) and\n(22) into Eqs.

We have chosen to couple the angular\nmomenta of the two hole states and of the two particle states first, and then, with another\n\n13\n\n\frecoupling, to obtain the total angular momentum of the 2p-2h excited state:\n|\u03a6\u03a0\nJM (2p2h)i =\n\nX\n\nMp ,Mh\n\nX\n\njh1 mh1 jh2 mh2\n\nhJp Mp Jh \u2212 Mh |JM i\n\nX\n\njp1 mp1 jp2 mp2\n\nhjp1 mp1 jp2 mp2 |Jp Mp i\n\n(\u22121)jh1 +jh2 \u2212mh1 \u2212mh2 hjh1 \u2212 mh1 jh2 \u2212 mh2 |Jh Mh i |\u03a6\u03a0\n2p2h i . (55)\n\nInserting Eq. (55) into Eq. (15) and applying the Wigner-Eckart theorem we obtain the\nfollowing expression:\n1,J\n(q) = hp1 p2 k OJ (q) h12 kh1 h2 i +\n\u03be2p2h\n\nA\nX\nk\n\nhp1 p2 kk OJ (q) h23 |h1 h2 ki ,\n\n(56)\n\nwhere the coordinate labels have the same meaning as in Eq. (34). In the 2p-2h excitation\nthe energy conservation does not uniquely define the energies of the emitted particles since\n\u03c9 = \u01ebp 1 + \u01ebp 2 \u2212 \u01ebh 1 \u2212 \u01ebh 2 ,\n\n(57)\n\nfor this reason in Eq. (55) an integration on the energy of the particle p2 is implied.\nIt is evident from Fig. 2 that the various diagrams can be related one to the other by\nchanging the labels of the hole and of the particle states involved.

(25)-(27) in the\nabove equations. The explicit expressions we have obtained are given in Appendix B.\n\n15\n\n\f5\n\nSpecific applications\n\nThe model described above has been applied to evaluate electromagnetic responses and cross\nsections in the quasi-elastic region for the doubly magic nuclei 16 O and 40 Ca.\nThe two-body correlation function and the single particle basis are the two inputs necessary to build the many-body wavefunctions used in the calculation of the responses. In\nour calculations the set of single particle wave functions have been generated by a spherical\nWoods-Saxon potential of the form:\nV (r) = V0 F (r) +\n\n\u0012\n\nh\u0304c\nm\u03c0\n\n\u00132\n\nVLS d\nF (r) l * \u03c3 + VC (r) ,\nr dr\n\n(65)\n\nwhere m\u03c0 is the pion mass, VC (r) the Coulomb potential produced by a homogeneously\ncharged sphere of radius R, and\nF (r) =\n\n1\n.\n1 + e(r\u2212R)/a\n\n(66)\n\nThe same parameterization of the potential has been used for both bound and continuum\nwaves.\nAs we have already anticipated, the other input of our approach, the two-body correlation\nfunction, is a purely scalar function. Single particle waves and correlation functions are not\nindependent quantities. In the theoretical framework of the CBF theory they are fixed by the\nminimization of the ground state energy functional. In our calculations we use wave functions\nand correlations taken from CBF-FHNC calculations of 16 O and 40 Ca ground states done with\ndifferent hamiltonians.\nA first set of many-body wavefunctions has obtained in Ref. [23] with the semi-realistic\nS3 interaction of Afnan and Tang. Specifically, we used the Woods-Saxon parameters of Tab.\n5 of that reference together with the correlations labelled Euler in Tab. 6. We should recall\nthat in that calculation the Woods-Saxon parameterizations was taken from the literature\nand the energy minimum was obtained by changing only the correlation function.\nThe second set of wave functions has been taken from Ref.[9] where a hamiltonian containing a V8' Argonne potential, which is a truncated version of the V18 interaction, together\nwith the Urbana IX three-body interaction has been used. Our calculations have been done\nwith the wavefunctions of Tab. V of that reference. Also in this case the Woods-Saxon\nparameters have been kept fixed and the energy minimum was found by changing only the\ncorrelation function. We should remark however that the energy minima found in these restricted calculations are only 7% larger than the those found by the full minimization. In\nour calculations we used only the scalar terms of the correlation functions of Ref. [9] which\nconsider the channels of Eq. (9) up to p = 6.\nHenceforth we shall label S3 and V8 all the quantities related to the wavefunctions of\nRef.[23] and [9] respectively.

The label S3 refer to the FHNC\ncalculations of Ref. [23] while V8 to those of Ref. [9].\n\n19\n\n\fTab. 1 the values of the parameters of the Woods-Saxon well. To complete the information\non the input, we present in Tab. 2 and 3 the values of the single particle energies and we\ncompare in Fig. 4 the MF and the correlated charge density distributions with the empirical\ndensities of Ref. [24]. The charge densities have been obtained by folding the pointlike proton\ndensities with the electromagnetic nucleon form factor of Ref. [25]. The same nucleon form\nfactor has been used in the calculation of the responses.\nSince the convection current contribution is already small at the MF level, as we show in\nFig. 5, we did not consider the correlated terms produced by this current. In any case the\nconvection current is included in the mean-field (MF) term.\n\n5.1\n\nOne-nucleon emission\n\nIn Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9 we present the electromagnetic 1p-1h responses calculated for the two\nnuclei considered for three different values of the the momentum transfer.\nIn these figures the full lines indicate the MF results. The dotted lines have been obtained\nby adding to the MF responses the contribution of two-point diagrams of Fig. 1, while the\ndashed lines show the results of the calculations when all the diagrams have been considered.\nIt is evident that the short-range correlations produce small effects on the inclusive responses. In the peak positions we found maximum relative variations with respect to the\nMF responses of 1.7% in the longitudinal and of 2.2% in the transverse responses. These\nvalues are within the range of the uncertainty produced by the different choices of nucleon\nform factors [26]. In spite of this we made a detailed investigation of the correlation effects\nbecause they can be relevant in the study of exclusive experiments.\nIn order to have a better view of the correlation effects we show in Figs. 10 and 11 the\ndifference between the correlated and MF responses:\nMF\n\u2206RL,T (q, \u03c9) = RL,T (q, \u03c9) \u2212 RL,T\n(q, \u03c9) .\n\n(67)\n\nIn these figures we have used the convention of indicating with the dotted lines the results\nobtained with the two-point diagrams only, and with the dashed line those obtained with all\nthe diagrams.\nThe inclusion of the three-point diagrams reduces the effects produced by the two-point\ndiagrams alone. This fact is more evident in the longitudinal responses and it is consistent\nwith the findings of Refs. [27, 28] where ground state charge and momentum distributions\nhave been studied. As discussed in sect. 3, the proper normalization of the many-body wave\nfunctions is obtained because in the limit for q \u2192 0 the three-point diagrams cancel exactly\nthe contribution of the two-point diagrams. This cancellation is present also for large values\nof the momentum transfer, but it is not exact any more. It is interesting to notice that the\nfinal correlated longitudinal responses are always smaller than the MF responses with the\nonly exception of the S3 result in 40 Ca at 300 MeV/c.\n\n20\n\n\fMF\n\n\u03c1 [fm-3]\n\nMF\n0.06\n\n0.06\n\ncorr\n\ncorr\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n16\n\n16\n\nO\n\n0.02\n\nO\n\n0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nr [fm]\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nr [fm]\n\n0.10\n\n0.14\n0.12\n\nS3\n\nV8\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n\u03c1 [fm-3]\n\nMF\n0.06\n\nMF\n\n0.08\n\ncorr\n\ncorr\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n40\n\nCa\n\n0.02\n\n40\n\nCa\n\n0.02\n0.00\n\n0.00\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\nr [fm]\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\nr [fm]\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n21\n\nS3\n\n0.08\n\nMF (dotted lines) and correlated (dashed lines) charge densities distributions\ncompared with the empirical densities (full lines) taken from the compilation of Ref.

The reason of this behavior has to be\nascribed to the diagram (2.3) of Fig. 1 which does not contributes in the transverse response\nas indicated in Appendix A. In this diagram the exchanged virtual photon strikes a nucleon\nwhich remains bound but through the correlation it excites a p-h pair producing the nucleon\nemission. Since in our calculations the correlation is a scalar function, only longitudinally\npolarized virtual photons can induce this type of excitation.\nTo study the effect of this diagram we set it artificially to zero also in the longitudinal\nchannel. The comparison with the correctly calculated longitudinal response is shown in Fig.\n12 for the 16 O response at q = 400 MeV/c calculated with the S3 wavefunctions. In the\nupper panel we show the responses, and in the lower one the \u2206Rl of Eq. (67). The (2.3)\ndiagram lowers the response and produces the discussed difference between longitudinal and\ntransverse responses. The curves without the contribution of the (2.3) diagram in the lower\npanel are very similar to the analogous ones of Fig. 10 for the transverse responses.\nAnother interesting feature observed in Figs. 10 and 11 is the different behavior shown\nby the S3 and V8 correlations. The two-point contributions of the S3 correlation are always\npositive, and the S3 total contributions are always larger than those of the V8.\nThe different features characterizing the two correlation functions are shown in Fig. 3.\nA first difference concerns the behavior at r = 0 where the S3 correlations assume larger\nvalues than the V8 ones. The second difference is related to the behavior at r values around\n1-1.5 fm, where the S3 correlation functions show a sizable overshooting with respect to the\nasymptotic value of 1. In order to study the effects of these two features on the response\nfunctions, we performed calculations using correlation functions of the form:\nf (r) = 1 \u2212 A exp[\u2212Br 2 ] + C exp[\u2212D(r \u2212 r0 )2 ] .\n\n(68)\n\nThis expression allowed us to disentangle and magnify the characteristics of the correlation\nfunction under investigation by changing the values of the parameters. The values used in our\ncalculations are given in Table 4. The correlations g1, g2 and g3, shown in the upper panel\nof Fig. 13, are composed only by a single gaussian and have been constructed to change only\nthe behavior at r = 0. The other correlations, shown in the lower panel of Fig. 13, have the\nsame behavior at r = 0 but have different overshooting properties at intermediate distances.\nWith these correlations we calculated the 16 O responses at q=400 MeV/c using the S3 set of\nsingle particle wave functions. The results of these calculations are summarized in Fig. 14\nwhere the \u2206RL,T defined in Eq. (67) are shown as functions of the excitation energy.\nThe two upper panels of the figure show the effect produced by changing the correlation\ndepth at r = 0. The global effect is a reduction of the MF responses, more evident in the\nlongitudinal one. The reduction is larger for deeper correlations. The other two panels of the\nfigure show the effects of the overshooting. There is a slight depletion of the longitudinal MF\nresponses and an enhancement of the transverse ones. The effects are magnified by shifting\n\n29\n\n\f-1\n\nR L(q) [MeV ]\n\n0.04\nNO (2.3)\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0.00\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nNO (2.3)\n\n1.00\n\n\u2206RL(q) [MeV\n\n-1\n\n] x 1000\n\n2.00\n\n0.00\n\n-1.00\n\n-2.00\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n\u03c9 [MeV]\n\nFigure 12: Upper panel:\n\n16 O\n\nlongitudinal responses calculated with the S3 input.

This figure clearly shows the role of the three-point\ndiagrams which always reduce the effects of the correlations.\nTo compare of our results with experimental data it is necessary to consider the effects of\nthe rescattering of the emitted nucleon with the residual nucleus [29]. We describe these Final\nState Interactions (FSI) effects with the method developed in Refs. [20, 21]. The method\nshows that, under certain approximations, it is possible to consider the FSI by folding the\nbare responses with a smoothing function:\nRFSI (q, \u03c9) =\n\nM\u2217\nM\n\nZ\n\n\u0014 \u0012\n\n\u221e\n\ndE R(q, E) \u03c1 E,\n\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nM\u2217\nM\u2217\n\u03c9 + \u03c1 E, \u2212\n\u03c9\nM\nM\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(69)\n\nwhere we have indicated with M and M \u2217 the free and effective nucleon masses respectively,\nand where the function \u03c1(E, \u03c9) describing the effects of FSI is:\n\u03c1(E, \u03c9) =\n\n\u0393(\u03c9)\n1\n.\n2\u03c0 [E \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 \u2206(\u03c9)]2 + [\u0393(\u03c9)/2]2\n\n(70)\n\nThe \u2206(\u03c9) and \u0393(\u03c9) functions of the above equation are connected by a dispersion relation:\n1\n\u2206(\u03c9) =\nP\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c9 \u2032\n\n\u0393(\u03c9 \u2032 )\n,\n\u03c9\u2032 \u2212 \u03c9\n\n(71)\n\nwhere P indicates the principal value of the integral. The function \u0393(\u03c9) is related to the\nimaginary part of the single particle self-energy. We have obtained \u0393(\u03c9) as average of the\nsingle particle energy width \u03b3(\u03c9):\n\u0393(\u03c9) =\n\n1\n\u03c9\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u01eb [\u03b3(\u01eb + \u03c9) + \u03b3(\u01eb \u2212 \u03c9)] .\n\n(72)\n\nThe single particle energy has not been calculated with a microscopic model, but, following\nRef.[30], has been parametrized as follows to reproduce empirical values:\n\u03b3(\u01eb) = a *\n\n\u01eb2\nh(\u01eb) ,\n\u01eb 2 + b2\n\n33\n\n(73)\n\n\fwith a = 11.5 and b = 18.\nThe effective nucleon mass takes into account non-locality effects of the mean-field which\ncannot be neglected. We determined the value of the effective nucleon mass by using the\nexpressions proposed in the polarization potential model of Ref. [31]:\n1\nM\u2217\n=\n,\nM\n1 + 2M \u2206U/(q 2 + q02 )\nwith\nq02 =\n\n2M \u2206U\n,\nM/M0\u2217 \u2212 1\n\n(74)\n\n(75)\n\n\u2206U =50 MeV and M0\u2217 = 0.8M .\nIn Fig. 15 we compare our 40 Ca longitudinal and transverse responses with the data\nof Refs. [32] and [33]. Dashed (full) lines show the results of the S3 (V8) calculations.\nBoth results are in a reasonable agreement with the data. The differences between the two\ncalculations are mainly produced by the differences in the mean-field basis rather than in the\ncorrelation functions.\nFor the nucleus 16 O, Rosenbluth separated data for longitudinal and transverse responses\nare not available. In Fig. 16 we compare our results with the cross section data taken at\nFrascati [34]. These data have been measured for fixed values of the incident electron energy\nand of the scattering angle and, therefore, the value of the momentum transfer changes at\nevery excitation energy. Since the data have been taken at the scattering angle of 32o , the\naverage momentum value for the cross section at \u01eb=700 MeV is about 400 MeV/c and that\nat \u01eb=1200 MeV is about 650 MeV/c.\nThe folding method used to consider FSI is thought for fixed values of the momentum\ntransfer. Every cross section point has been calculated by fixing the value of q, calculating\nthe response on a wide energy range (up to 400 MeV), folding the response with Ed.

(16).\nAlso in Fig. 16 the full (dashed) lines show the results obtained with the V8 (S3) input.\nThe agreement with the data is satisfactory, especially for the cross sections measured at\nhigher energies. The differences between the S3 and V8 results are even smaller than in the\ncase of 40 Ca and the data cannot discriminate between them.\n\n5.2\n\nTwo-nucleon emission\n\nThe study of the two-nucleon emission responses is limited by the heavy computational load.\nFor this reason we have restricted our investigation to the 16 O nucleus only.\nFor these calculations we used the same configuration space considered in the one-nucleon\nemission calculations.

(55)).\nWe found that the contribution of the various partial waves becomes smaller the higher\nis the angular momentum value. Specifically, we have seen that for q \u223c 600 MeV/c the\ncontribution of partial waves with l > 4 is about the 2% of the total value at an excitation\nenergy of 100 MeV and becomes about the 40% at the excitation energy of 300 MeV. These\npercentiles remain roughly constant in the momentum transfer range between 400 and 600\nMeV/c. In order to reduce the computational time we performed a complete calculation for\nthe partial waves with l \u2264 4 while we made a statistical evaluation of the contribution of\nthe higher partial waves. This statistical evaluation consist in calculating a randomly chosen\n10% of the 2p-2h matrix elements, and in rescaling the obtained results proportionally to\nthe total number of the matrix elements to be calculated. This simplification reduced by\n2/3 the computational time. We have tested the reliability of this simplifying technique by\ncalculating all the 2p-2h matrix elements at the excitation energies of 100, 200 and 300 MeV.\nIn all the cases investigated we found differences with respect to the simplified calculations\nsmaller than 1%.\nThe calculations of the two-nucleon emission responses have been done for both correlation functions at excitation energies of 100, 140, 200, 240 and 300 MeV for the kinematical\nconditions used to evaluate the inclusive cross sections of Fig. 16 at \u01eb = 700 and 1080 MeV.\nThe values of the responses obtained in these calculations are shown in Fig. 17 by the squares\n(S3) and by the circles (V8).\nA direct comparison with the results of Ref. [35] is not straightforward, since the calculations of that reference have been done on the 12 C nucleus, and obviously, with different inputs.\nConsidering these differences we can say that the order of magnitude of the two calculations\nis the same. In the two calculations it is however remarkably different the contribution of\nthe three-point diagrams. We found a maximum contribution to RL of about 8% and even\nsmaller, 1%, for the transverse response. In the longitudinal response the interference between two- and three-point diagrams is always destructive, therefore the final response is\nalways smaller than that of the two-point diagrams alone. The contradiction with the findings of Ref. [35], where the three-point diagrams were giving an important contribution to\nthe response, was produced by a computer error we found in our previous calculations.\nThe results of Fig. 17 show a large sensitivity to the choice of the correlation. This\nis not surprising since in these calculations the two-nucleon emission is produced only by\nmeans of the short range correlation. We have also verified the sensitivity to the choice of the\nmean-field by calculating responses with V8 correlation and S3 mean-field for \u01eb=1080 MeV.\nThe results obtained in this way are shown in Fig. 17 by the triangles. The changes of the\nmean-field wave functions affect considerably the final result.\nThe two-nucleon emission responses have been used to calculate the inclusive cross section.\nThe total responses have been obtained by adding one- and two-nucleon emission responses.\n\n37\n\n\fR T [MeV\n\n]x1000\n\n-1\n\nR L [MeV -1]x1000\n0.50\n\n0.40\n\n\u03b5 = 700 MeV\n\n0\n\n0.16\n\n0\n50\n\n50\n100\n\n100\n\n0.08\n\n0.30\n\nS3\n0.06\n\n0.20\n\nV8\n0.04\n\n0.10\n\n0.00\n150\n\n150\n200\n\n200\n\n\u03c9 [MeV]\n250\n\n250\n300\n\n300\n\n350\n\n0.20\n\n\u03b5 = 700 MeV\n\n0.12\n0.12\n\n0.08\n0.08\n\n0.04\n0.04\n\n0.00\n350\n\n\u03b5 = 1080 MeV\n\n0.02\n\n0.00\n0\n\n0.16\n\n0\n\n50\n\n50\n\n100\n\n0.20\n\n\u03b5 = 1080 MeV\n\n0.00\n100\n\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n\n\u03c9 [MeV]\n\n38\n\nFigure 17: The symbols show the calculated values of the longitudinal and transverse twonucleon emission responses in 16 O. Squares and circles show the results obtained with the V8\nand S3 input respectively. The triangles have been calculated using the V8 correlation and\nthe S3 mean-field wave functions. The various lines have been obtained by linear (dashed\nlines) and quadratic (full lines) interpolation of the points.\n\n0.10\n\n\fTo make this sum we have interpolated the results of Fig. 17 in order to obtain the values\nof the 2p-2h responses at the desired excitation energies. We have used linear and quadratic\ninterpolations and their results are shown in Fig. 17 by the dashed and full lines respectively.\nThese interpolations as well as more sophisticated interpolation techniques we have also used\nproduce results which are the same within the accuracy of the calculations. For the evaluation\nof the cross section we used the results of the quadratic interpolation.\nThe comparison of the results of Fig. 17 with those of Figs. 6 and 7 shows that the\n2p-2h responses at the peak energy are two orders of magnitude smaller than the 1p-1h ones.\nThe contribution of two-nucleon emission becomes relevant only at higher energies, in the\ndip region. As example, we show in Fig. 18 the contribution of the various V8 responses in\nthe dip region for the two kinematical cases we have considered. The dashed lines represent\nthe tail of the 1p-1h responses while the dashed-dotted lines the contribution of the 2p-2h\nresponses. The full lines are the sum of the two. It is interesting to notice the different\nbehavior of the responses for the cases at 700 and 1080 MeV. In the first case, for excitation\nenergies above 220 MeV the 2p-2h responses become larger than the 1p-1h ones. For \u01eb=1080\nMeV the 1p-1h responses remain always larger than the 2p-2h ones. This different behavior\nis produced by the larger value of the momentum transverse in this last case which shifts the\n1p-1h responses to higher energies. For this reason the tail of this response has not yet died\nout as in the 700 MeV case.\nThe calculation of the cross section requires the inclusion of the FSI effects. We have\ntreated them with the folding model previously described. There are ambiguities in our\nprocedure of including the FSI interaction. We could apply the folding procedure to the\ntotal responses or separately to the 1p-1h and 2p-2h responses and then sum the two folded\nresponses. The two procedures gave results differing only by few percent. We show in Fig. 19\nthe tail of the calculated cross sections. The dashed lines present the pure 1p-1h results while\nthe full lines have been obtained by including also the 2p-2h contribution. The effects of the\n2p-2h responses which appeared in Fig.18 are washed out by the inclusion of the FSI, whose\neffects are much larger than those produced by the short range correlations. The inclusion of\ntwo-nucleon emission responses does not modify the comparison with the experimental data\nshown in Fig. 16.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have presented a model to evaluate the effects of the short-range correlations\nin the excitation of the one-body nuclear responses. Our model takes into account both twoand three-body diagrams where the short-range correlations appear at the first order. We\nhave shown that both kinds of diagrams are necessary to have properly normalized wave\nfunctions.\n\n39\n\n\fFigure 18: Longitudinal and transverse responses of\n\n16 O\n\nin the dip region calculated with\nV8 input.

[23] and [9] by a minimization of the nuclear ground\nstate energy.\nThe model has been applied to evaluate the inclusive electromagnetic longitudinal and\ntransverse responses in the quasi-elastic region for the 16 O and 40 Ca nuclei. We have considered both one- and two-nucleon emission channels. The longitudinal response has been\ncalculated using the charge operator. In the transverse response we have considered the\nmagnetization current and we have included the convection current only in the uncorrelated\ndiagram.\nOur results show that the effect of the correlations on the one-particle emission responses\nis small, certainly within the range of uncertainty related to the different choices of the\nelectromagnetic nucleon form factors. In spite of this, we made a detailed investigation\nof short-range correlations effects in our model because they can be relevant in exclusive\nprocesses.\nThe three-point diagrams, usually neglected in the literature, interfere destructively with\nthe two-point diagrams. For this reason any effect produced by the two-point diagrams is\nalways reduced when the three-point ones are included. In certain situations this reduction\nis of the order of 80%.\nOur calculations show that the correlations act differently on longitudinal and transverse\nresponses. Specifically, we found that the longitudinal responses are lowered while the transverse ones are enhanced. This happens because some of the three-point diagrams do not\ncontribute in the longitudinal response.\nWe have calculated the inclusive cross sections in 16 O to compare our results with the\ndata of Ref. [34]. In 40 Ca the comparison has been done directly with the empirical responses\nof Ref. [33]. In both cases the agreement with the data is quite satisfactory independently\nof the inclusion of the short-range correlations.\nThe two-nucleon emission responses have been calculated only for the 16 O nucleus. Because of the heavy computational load we have simplified the calculation by evaluating the\nmost important matrix elements and providing a statistical estimation of the others.\nAs in the one-nucleon emission case, also in the two-nucleon emission responses, the twoand three-point diagrams produce effects with opposite sign. However, in this case we found\nthat the contribution of the three-point diagrams is at most of the order of a few percent of\nthat of the two-point diagrams.\nIn the quasi-elastic region, our calculations show that the 2p-2h responses are two order\nof magnitude smaller than the 1p-1h ones.\nSummarizing our results, we should say that a proper normalization of the many body\nwave function in a first order expansion model for the correlations, requires the inclusion of\nthe three-body terms. The contribution of these terms always reduces the effect produced by\nthe two-point diagrams. This effect is not negligible in the one-nucleon emission responses,\n\n42\n\n\fbut it becomes rather small in the two-nucleon emission.\nThe use of different correlations, together with different set of single particle wave functions, has clearly shown the sensitivity of the results to both parts of the input of the calculations. This is true not only in the 1p-1h responses, where the result was expected since they\nare dominated by the uncorrelated terms, but also in the 2p-2h responses, where the uncorrelated term is not present. Physically meaningful results can be obtained only if single particle\nwave functions and short range correlations are linked through the nuclear hamiltonian.\nIn our calculations the presence of short-range correlations does not produce remarkable\neffects. There are other effects beyond the pure mean-field model, such as final state interactions and meson exchange currents [37], which are more important. We should, however,\npoint out that we have used only scalar correlation functions. There are indications that\nstate dependent correlations together with MEC [36] could produce sizable effects.\nThe next step of our work will be to apply the model to the description of exclusive\nelectron scattering experiments, (e,e'N) and (e,e'2N), where one expects that the effects of\nthe short-range correlations could be disentangled.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank M.

One-particle emission matrix elements\nIn this appendix we give the expressions of the matrix elements involved in the one-nucleon\nemission part of the longitudinal and transverse responses.
