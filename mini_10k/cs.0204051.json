For instance, the Swedish\nSecurities Dealers Association finds that it has no objections to program trading, and already in 1992 declared that only the means to exploiting unlawful\nquotes manipulation, resulting from program trading, should be controlled19 .\nNasdaq, in a communication to their members write17 :\nRecent events show that the way some stocks are traded is changing\ndramatically, and the change in trading methods may affect price\nvolatility and cause increased trading volume. This price volatility\nand increased volume present new hazards to investors, regardless of\nwhether trading occurs on-line or otherwise.\n\nBomJohLybCR: submitted to World Scientific on October 24, 2018\n\n1\n\n\fIn general, stock markets do not apply restrictive policies to program trading.\nA primary objective of the market place operator is to promote a high liquidity\nin the traded instruments. This can be done through reducing the transaction\ncosts: one typical implicit cost is lack of orders, leading to wide spreads, or\nnon-existing quotes. The operators thus have reasons to encourage inbound\norders. As long as these are authenticated, and the network can keep up\ndisseminating the market info in a proper fashion so that the situation stays in\nline with the overall aim of up-keeping a fair and orderly market, the operator\nshould have nothing against a large number of valid orders per second being\nplaced by artificial agents.\nHence, we feel motivated to relate certain theoretical results from physics\nto artificial traders of the future. We do not assume markets populated\nsolely by artificial traders, however. If we did, we could move on to claim\nthat the Efficient Market Hypothesis and rational choice theory yield efficient equilibria14 , since the vast empirical evidence against such assumptions\nare directed almost exclusively towards human traders13 . We instead believe\nthat artificial traders have gradually and almost unnoticeably slipped onto\nthe same markets as human traders, and we will treat them as speculating noise traders (traders with non-rational expectations and potentially zero\nintelligence)6 . Artificial stock markets possibly exhibit volatility (i.e., standard deviation) of a different kind than ordinary excess volatility markets2,\nas argued, e.g., in the ban of crawlers from the Internet auction site eBay20 .\nIn practice, Internet marketplaces supply information on their acceptance of\nartificial traders and other softbots in a file named robots.txt, and on Internet markets that do allow for softbots, their behavior is usually monitored in\nsome way, in order to mitigate the effects of speculation through unconventional methods such as denial-of-service attacks. Program trading has also in\ngeneral reached a level where flocking behavior worry policy makers7 . On an\nartificial stock market, in contrast to an ordinary market16 , active portfolio\nmanagement should also incorporate the price dynamics, because of the intense trading. This factor has also led to transaction fee policies being radical\non some artificial trader markets. Since significant transaction fees can render\nthe Parrondo strategies described in sections 2 and 3 below useless, the existence of markets with low or no transaction fees is important to our object.\nWe will consider portfolios on markets with receding prices. We will represent\nartificial traders as agents in a multi-agent system (MAS), in which agents\naffect each other's behavior through trusted message passing, as explained in\nsection 3. In the MAS setting, variations of Parrondo strategies are then subject to experiments on a simulation testbed, the results of which are reported\nin section 4. In the last section, we present directions for future research.\n\nBomJohLybCR: submitted to World Scientific on October 24, 2018\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe Parrondo Strategy in Games\n\nThe flashing ratchet (or Brownian motor)1 is a molecular motor system consisting of Brownian particles moving in asymmetric potentials, subject to a\nsource of non-equilibrium18 . In its game-theoretical formulation9 , the flashing\nratchet can be described in terms of two games (A and B) in which biased\ncoins are tossed.\n\u2022 Game A is a single coin game in which the coin comes up heads (=win)\n50 \u2212 \u01eb per cent of the time (for some small \u01eb > 0) and results in tails the\nrest of the times (Parrondo himself18 used \u01eb = 0.005, and the constraints\nare described, e.g., at seneca.fis.ucm.es/parr/GAMES/discussion.\nhtml).\n\u2022 Game B involves two coins. The first coin comes up heads 10 \u2212 \u01eb per\ncent of the time, and the second coin 75 \u2212 \u01eb per cent of the time. What\ncoin to flip is decided through looking at the capital of the player. If it\nis divisible by 3, the first coin is flipped, while the second coin is used in\nthe rest of the cases.\nClearly, game A is a losing game, but the same holds for game B. This is\nbecause the player is only allowed to flip the second coin if her capital is not\na multiple of 3. The latter situation comes up more often than every third\ntime: The player will start with the unfavorable coin, which will very likely\nplace her in loss -1. She will then typically revert to 0, and then back again to\n-1, and so on. Whenever the unfavorable coin lands tails twice in succession,\nhowever, she will end up with capital -3, and then the pattern will repeat,\nleading to -6, etc. Hence, game B is a losing game, just like game A.\nThe Parrondo strategy for playing games A and B repeatedly is to choose\nrandomly which game to play next. Somewhat counter-intuitively, this discrete representation of a ratchet yields a winning game.\n3\n\nThe Parrondo Strategy in Artificial Trading\n\nArtificial trading and herd behavior have often been studied through bottomup simulations, as in Sugarscape8 or the Santa Fe artificial stock market2 .\nWe have concentrated on speculating investors that use variations of the Parrondo strategy. Table 1 briefly describes these strategies, as well as some\ncontrol strategies. Value investors (exemplified by BLSH in Table 1) seek\nprofits, while trend investors (exemplified by BHSL in Table 1) try to identify\nupward and downward movers and adjust their portfolios accordingly10 . In\n\nBomJohLybCR: submitted to World Scientific on October 24, 2018\n\n3\n\n\fStrategy\nBuy-and-hold\n(BaH)\nRandom\nInsider\nBuy low, sell high\n(BLSH)\n\nBuy low, sell random (BLSR)\nBuy random, sell\nhigh (BRSH)\nBuy high, sell low\n(BHSL)\n\nDescription\nThe buy-and-hold strategy here acts as a control\nstrategy that trades no stocks.\nThis strategy trades stocks randomly.\nThe insider gets quality ex ante information about\nsome stocks on which it may react before the market.\nThis Markovian value investor strategy monitors if\nthe stock increased or decreased in value during the\nlatest time interval. If the value increased, it sells the\nstock, and if the value dropped, it buys the stock.\nLike BLSH, except BLSR randomly chooses what\nstock to sell.\nLike BLSH, except BRSH randomly chooses what\nstock to buy.\nThis Markovian trend investor strategy is the opposite of BLSH.\nTable 1. The artificial trading strategies.\n\nour simulations, the value investor proportion is larger, but this significant\nfact notwithstanding, our object is not the study of how it affects the market\ndynamics. Instead, we augment the Parrondo variations by market information, in the form of agent messages. The agents may thus influence each other\nby passing hints on what to buy, or what to sell. A message is treated by\nthe receiver as trusted information, and the receiving agent will act upon the\ncontent of the message, interpreting it as normative advice. A message can be\ninterpreted as perfect (or even insider) information, randomized for the sake\nof our experiment.\nWe considered a portfolio of ten stocks with receding prices, assumed to be\nunaffected by agent trading. The data used is real daily data from the Swedish\nstock market, from the one-year period starting March 1, 2000. The stocks\nare listed in Table 2, and in Figure 1 their development is shown. Values have\nbeen normalized to 100 for the start of the period. The strategies initially\nheld $10000 value of each stock. One trade was done per day, in which the\nstrategy decided what to sell and what to reinvest in. Three different levels\nof hint probabilities were used: 1%, 5%, and 10% chance of receiving a hint.\nA 1% level means that the strategy will on average receive a hint for one of\nthe ten stocks every tenth day of trading. When choosing randomly what to\nbuy and what to sell, 10 integers were randomized and taken modulo 10 in\n\nBomJohLybCR: submitted to World Scientific on October 24, 2018\n\n4\n\n\fStock\nABB\nAllgon\nBoliden\nEnea Data\nHennes&Mauritz\nEricsson\nOM\nScania\nSecuritas\nSkandia\n\nBusiness area\nIndustrial\nTelecom\nMining\nIT\nClothes\nTelecom\nFinancial\nIndustrial\nSecurity\nInsurance\n\nValue\n83.33\n24.55\n37.19\n20.09\n60.40\n36.36\n48.67\n77.80\n80.35\n53.22\n\nTable 2.

For each of the stocks\nsold, a percentage of the possession p \u2208 [0.2, 0.8] was sold. The values of all\nsales were then reinvested according to their relative part in a similar selection\nprocess. If the strategy did not get at least one stock to buy and one to sell, it\nheld its possessions until the next day. Each strategy was evaluated towards\nthe same set of stocks and the same set of hints (if used). In order to even\nout differences due to the randomness of the trading, the simulations were\nrepeated 1000 times. Alignment and docking experiments are encouraged,\nand specifics are available upon request.\n4\n\nExperiment Results\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 2, most of the strategies over the 252 trading days\nfollowed the major trends of the market and none of them managed to maintain the initial portfolio value. There was considerable movement, as shown\nin the blowup of the last days of trading in Figure 3, but also significant\ndifferences between outcomes (Table 3). Buy-low-sell-random was the only\nstrategy that outperformed Random. Strategies also differed with respect to\nvolatility. For instance, BLSH was inferior to all strategies for most of the\nyear. However, around day 100 through day 120, it outperformed all other\nstrategies. As expected, BHSL amplified the receding trend.\nIn spite of its poor performance, there are still many reasons for policy makers and speculators to use buy-and-hold even on supposedly receding\nmarkets. One reason is to declare and uphold a clear company investment\n\nBomJohLybCR: submitted to World Scientific on October 24, 2018\n\n5\n\n\f120\n\n100\n\nValue\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\nABB\nAllgon\nBoliden\nEnea\nH&M\nEricsson\nOMG\nScania\nSecuritas\nSkandia\n\n0\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nTime\n\nFigure 1.

Our model is simplistic, in the\nfollowing respects. The messages sent must be allowed to have richer content,\nand may be indicators or signals, rather than simple instructions. Instead\nof interpreting received messages as normative advice, trust could somehow\nbe represented. For instance, a probability distribution may be associated\nwith messages, and trust assignments can then be represented as secondorder probabilities. Market norms should be modeled and adhered to by the\ntraders3 . Message content can then depend on market dynamics. Artificial\ntraders have two ways of communicating such dynamics. Firstly, they may\nobserve and recognize other traders and try to model them with the intent\nof communication and possibly co-operation5. Secondly, they may monitor\nprices, as in the Trading Agent Competition4 (see tac.eecs.umich.edu/) or\nartificial stock market approaches11. Naturally, each trader itself also observes\nthe market dynamics. We have placed no reasoning facilities in the trader at\nthis stage, and so the trader cannot act on sense data.

In rare circumstances, such as during the period of almost universally\nreceding prices of IT stocks in the autumn of 2000, ex ante portfolios could\nrelatively easily be assembled, and then Parrondo variations would indeed be\nan interesting alternative to buy-and-hold. For our experiment, the real data\nwas chosen ex post from a large sample space with the criterion that each\nstock should have a saw-tooth receding price curve.\nWhile the above shortcomings together render our results useless for practical purposes, they should be seen as directions for future research. We intend to pursue the important question of strategy programming for artificial\ntraders, as we feel that such programming will be of increasing importance\nin the future. By replacing our unrealistic assumptions one by one, we hope\nto achieve our ultimate goal of reasonably efficient strategies on real-time\nmarkets with non-linear dynamics.\n\nBomJohLybCR: submitted to World Scientific on October 24, 2018\n\n8\n\n\f12000\nBaH\nInsider 1%\nInsider 5%\nInsider 10%\n\n11000\n\n10000\n\nValue\n\n9000\n\n8000\n\n7000\n\n6000\n\n5000\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nTime\n\nFigure 4.
