Due to\nthis, a gain from a positive-temperature (inversion-free) two-level system is shown to be possible.\nPACS: 03.65.Ta, 03.65.Yz, 05.30\n\nAfter E.L. Hahn discovered the spin-echo in NMR\nphysics [1], it was soon suspected to violate the second\nlaw [1,2]; for a recent discussion discussion see e.g. [2,3].\nAs a precursor to this question, we shall investigate in\nthis Letter whether single or double pulses on single spins\ncoupled to a bath already mark a violation of this law.\n\nHB =\n\nX\n\nh\u0304\u03c9k \u00e2\u2020k \u00e2k ,\n\nk\n\nHI =\n\nThe cause of the breakdown the universal thermodynamic picture is the occurrence of a cloud of interaction\nmodes (photons or phonons) around the central system.\nSuch a cloud is already familiar from the dressed electron\npicture in quantum electrodynamics. For systems of our\ninterest, the cloud is not present at high temperatures,\nbut, due to the non-vanishing coupling to the bath, it\nbuilds up at low T , inducing non-thermodynamic physics.\n\nJ(\u03c9) =\n\nX g2\ngh\u0304 \u2212\u03c9/\u0393\nk\n\u03b4(\u03c9k \u2212 \u03c9) =\ne\n,\nh\u0304\u03c9k\n\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nk\n\nwhere g is the dimensionless damping constant and the\nexponential cuts off the coupling at \u03c9 \u226b \u0393, the maximal frequency of the bath. As usual, the thermodynamic\nlimit for the bath has been taken here.\nSince \u2206 = 0, one has conservation of \u03c3\u0302z (t) = \u03c3\u0302z (0) (in\nthe Heisenberg picture). The dynamics of the annihilation operator of the k'th bath mode reads\n\nTwo level systems [7,8], like electrons or two-state\natoms in a field, or a two level Josephson junction, display relaxational behavior due to coupling to a bath.\nTransversal and longitudinal correlations relax on timescales T2 and T1 , respectively, with typically T2 \u226a T1 [8],\nsince energy transfer is not involved in the T2 - process.\nThe Hamiltonian of the problem reads:\n\n\u00e2k (t) = e\u2212i\u03c9k t \u00e2k (0) +\nH = HS + HB + HI ,\n\nk\n\nThis is a spin 21 interacting with a bath of harmonic oscillators (spin-boson model [7,9]); HS , HB and HI stand\nfor the Hamiltonians of the spin, the bath and their interaction, respectively. \u03c3\u0302x , \u03c3\u0302y and \u03c3\u0302z = \u2212i\u03c3\u0302x \u03c3\u0302y are Pauli\nmatrices, and \u00e2\u2020k and \u00e2k are the creation and annihilation\noperators of the bath oscillator with the index k, while\nthe gk are the coupling constants. For an electron in a\nmagnetic field B, \u03b5 = \u1e21\u03bcB B is the energy, with \u1e21 the\ngyro-magnetic factor and \u03bcB the Bohr magneton. We\nshall restrict ourselves to the model with \u2206 = 0, which\nis a prototype of a variety of physical systems [7], and\nknown to be exactly solvable [7,9], since z-component of\nthe spin is conserved, and with it the spin energy. Physically it means that we restrict ourselves to times much\nless than T1 . In NMR (ESR) physics [8] the model represents a spin (electron) interacting with a bath of phonons.\nIn quantum optics it is suitable for describing a two-level\natom interacting with a photonic bath.\nStarting from general physical arguments [7], one typically takes the quasi-Ohmic spectral density of the bath\n\nRecently we analyzed the thermodynamics of the\nCaldeira-Leggett model for a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a quantum harmonic bath [4,5]. At low\ntemperatures various formulations of the second law are\nviolated: the Clausius inequality d\u0304Q \u2264 T dS is broken,\nthe rates of energy dispersion and entropy production\ncan be negative, and certain cycles are possible where\nheat extracted from the bath is fully converted into work\n(\"perpetuum mobile\"). These findings are nevertheless\nin agreement with the Thomson formulation of the second law (cycles cost work) applied to an equilibrium initial distribution, for which an exact proof exists [6].\n\n\u2206\n\u03b5\nHS = \u03c3\u0302z + \u03c3\u0302x ,\n2\n2\n\n1X\ngk (\u00e2\u2020k + \u00e2k )\u03c3\u0302z .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nThis implies\n1\n\n\u0001\ngk \u03c3\u0302z\ne\u2212i\u03c9k t \u2212 1 .\n2h\u0304\u03c9k\n\n(3)\n\n\fX\nk\n\ngk [ \u00e2\u2020k (t) + \u00e2k (t) ] = \u03b7\u0302(t) \u2212 \u03c3\u0302z G(t),\n\nwhere we denoted the quantum noise operator\nX\n\u03b7\u0302(t) =\ngk [\u00e2\u2020k (0)ei\u03c9k t + \u00e2k (0)e\u2212i\u03c9k t ],\n\nThe result is stationary, as it should.

In the course\nof time |h~\u03c3 (t)i| decays to |h\u03c3\u0302z (0)i|, which makes the von\nNeumann entropy increase. Since there is no heat flow\n- the energy is conserved - this is in agreement with a\nformulation of the second law: the entropy of closed system, or of an open system without energy transfer (the\nspin in contact with the bath), cannot decrease.\nA sudden pulse. We mostly consider the Hamiltonian (1) with \u2206 = 0. A fast rotation around the xaxis is described by taking \u2206 6= 0 during a short time\n\u03b41 ; this is called a fast pulse [8]. If \u2206 \u223c 1/\u03b41 is\nlarge, the evolution operator describing the pulse becomes U1 = exp(\u2212i\u03b41 H(\u2206)/h\u0304) \u2248 exp( 21 i \u03b8\u03c3\u0302x ) + O(\u03b41 ),\nwhere \u03b8=\u2212\u03b41 \u2206/h\u0304 is the rotation angle,\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nThe spin operators \u03c3\u0302\u00b1 = \u03c3\u0302x \u00b1 i \u03c3\u0302y satisfy\ni\n\u03c3\u0302 \u0307 \u00b1 = [ \u00b1\u03b5 + \u03b7\u0302(t) \u2212 G(t) ] \u03c3\u0302\u00b1\nh\u0304\n\n(16)\n\nT2 can thus be identified with the transversal decay time.\nFor small g this is a strong enhancement of the quantumtimescale h\u0304/T . The most optimistic case, T2 \u223c 100 s at\nroom temperature, involves g \u223c 10\u221216 , truly small.\nThe density matrix of the spin reads\n\nshowing that 1/\u0393 is the relaxation time of the bath.\nSeparated initial state. To describe situations, where\nthe spin was suddenly brought into the contact with\nthe bath, e.g. an electron injected into semiconductor, atom injected into a cavity, or exciton created by\nexternal radiation, we make the assumption that initially, at t = 0, the spin and the bath are in a separated state, the latter being Gibbsian at temperature\nT = 1/\u03b2: \u03c1(0) = \u03c1S (0) \u2297 exp(\u2212\u03b2HB )/ZB , where \u03c1S (0)\nis the initial density matrix of the spin.

In\norder to ensure that the pulse does not change the energy\nof the spin, we first consider the case \u03b5 = 0, where the\n2\n\n\fspin has no energy. For small g, \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0/2 and t \u226b 1/\u0393\none gets\nW1 =\n\ngh\u0304\u0393 gT\n+\nh\u03c3\u0302x (0)i e\u2212t/T2\n2\u03c0\n2\n\n(\u2206Q > 0, \u2206U = 0). This process, possible by choosing\nt \u2248 2\u03c0n/\u03c90 with integer n, can be considered as a cycle\nof a perpetuum mobile, forbidden by folklore minded formulations of the second law. Indeed, under a rotation the\nlength |h~\u03c3 i|, and with it the von Neumann entropy, is left\ninvariant, so one has a process with \u2206Q > 0 , \u2206SvN = 0,\nwhich violates the Clausius inequality \u2206Q \u2264 T \u2206SvN .\nThe work needed at time zero to rotate the spin is\n\n(23)\n\nIf for a fixed t, temperature is neither too large nor\ntoo small, T e\u2212t/T2 > h\u0304\u0393/\u03c0, work can be extracted\n(W1 < 0), provided the spin started in a coherent state\nh\u03c3\u0302x (0)i = \u22121. This possibility to extract work from the\nbath disappears on the timescale T2 , because then the spin\nlooses its coherence, h\u03c3\u0302x,y (t)i \u2192 0. Without a pulse the\nspin energy is conserved, however. Notice that any combination of \u00b1\u03c0 pulses (this is a classical variation, since\nthe coherence is not involved) can extract work only from\na non-thermalized bath, i.e. for times \u223c 1/\u0393.\nInitial preparation via a rotation. Our approach\nalso allows to consider a specific, well controllable nonequilibrium initial state: a Gibbsian of the total system,\n\u03c1G = exp(\u2212\u03b2H)/Z, in which at t = 0 the spin is rotated\nover an angle \u2212 21 \u03c0 around the y-axis, \u03c1(0) = U0 \u03c1G U0\u22121 ,\nwith U0 = exp(\u2212i\u03c0\u03c3\u0302y /4).

It can be verified that the total work\nW0 +W1 is always positive, so Thomson's formulation for\na cyclic change [6] (here: the combination of the pulses\nat time t = 0 and t) starting from equilibrium is obeyed.\nTwo pulses in a rotated initial Gibbsian state. If\nthere are many spins, each in a slightly different external\nfield, there appears an inhomogeneous broadening of the\n\u03c90 = \u03b5/h\u0304 line, for which we assume the distribution\n\nwhere \u03b3(t) of Eq. (9) arises from friction, with \u03b3(\u221e) =\n1\n2 g, and where \u03c90 = \u03b5/h\u0304. Typically g is small, so work is\nextracted (W1 < 0) when the sinus is positive.

It is common\nknowledge that a two-level system with population inversion, i.e. with a negative temperature, is capable to\namplify light, and it represents the basic working mechanism of lasers and masers (see [10] for more non-standard\nmechanisms of lasing). In this context a bath is typically\nconsidered to be a drawback for the amplification, as being a source of undesirable noises and relaxation towards\n\n(27)\n\nNotice its similarity with \u2212W1 of Eq. (23). An interesting case is where work is performed by the total system (W1 < 0) solely due to heat taken from the bath\n3\n\n\fequilibrium [10]. Our present aim is to show that the\nbath can nevertheless play a totally different role, namely\nin assisting work extraction (gain) by means of an positive\ntemperature state in the two-level system. This effect is\nstrictly prohibited by the second law applied to a positive\ntemperature spin state if there were no coupling to the\nbath [6]. We consider separated initial conditions with\nh\u03c3\u0302x (t)i = h\u03c3\u0302y (t)i = 0, and apply a \u2212 21 \u03c0 pulse at time\nt1 = 0+ , and a 12 \u03c0 pulse at t2 . For t2 \u226b 1/\u0393 the work is:\n\nconductor T2 \u223c 1 \u03bcs [15]; (iii) for an exciton created in\na quantum dot T2 \u223c 10\u22129 s [16] (in cases (ii) and (iii)\n1/\u0393 \u223c 10\u221213 s and femtosecond (10\u221215 s) laser pulses are\navailable); (iv) in NMR physics T2 \u223c 1 \u2212 10s and the\nduration of pulses can be comparable with 1/\u0393 \u223c 1 \u03bcs.\nConclusion. Like in the oscillator model [4], the Clausius inequality can be violated in the spin-boson model,\nnamely by a single pulse. For many spins this typically\ndoes not happen in the first pulse; it may occur in the\nsecond pulse, while it is absent for the two pulses taken\ntogether, because of intermediate entropy increase. Work\ncan be extracted from the equilibrated bath, for the single spin case by one pulse, and for the many spin case by\ntwo pulses. This contradicts Thomson's formulation of\nthe second law: no gain from cycles. Gain is also possible\nfrom a positive temperature (inversion-free) initial state,\nwhich may serve as a principle for bath generated lasing\nand masing. These effects are not in a conflict with the\nequilibrium Thomson formulation of the second law, and\nare fully quantum: they disappear at high temperatures\nand they do not occur for classical pulses.\n\nW = \u2206U \u2212 \u2206Q,\n(32)\n\u03b5\ng\u03b5 \u2212\u03be(t2 )\n\u2212\u03be(t2 )\n\u2206U = \u2212 [1 \u2212 e\ncos \u03c90 t2 ]h\u03c3\u0302z i +\ne\nsin \u03c90 t2\n2\n4\ngh\u0304\u0393 1\n+ gT e\u2212\u03be(t2 ) sin \u03c90 t2 h\u03c3\u0302z i\n(33)\n\u2206Q = \u2212\n\u03c0\n2\nwhere \u03be was defined in (17). In the inversion-free case,\nthe initial state of the spin is a Gibbsian connected to\na positive temperature T0 = 1/\u03b20 , for which h\u03c3\u0302z i =\n\u2212 tanh 12 \u03b20 \u03b5 \u2264 0. Let us first investigate the case T0 = \u221e\n(completely random state, h\u03c3\u0302x,y,z i = 0). The work W\ncan be negative (gain) provided \u03b5 > 4h\u0304\u0393/\u03c0. This situation can be met in quantum optical two-level systems\n[10,11] and in NMR [12]. This mechanism concerns work\nextraction with help of the bath (it disappears for g \u2192 0),\nbut not from the bath, since now \u2206Q < 0. The origin of\nthe effect is that although the state of the spin was completely disordered initially, the first pulse does generate\nsome coherence. Due to back-reaction of the bath one has\nafter the pulses h\u03c3\u0302y (t2 )i = sin \u03b3(t2 ) exp(\u2212\u03be(t2 )) sin \u03c90 t2 ,\nwhere \u03b3(t2 ) of Eq. (9) goes from 0 to 21 g on the timescale\n1/\u0393, the reaction time of the bath.\nAt finite T0 the term \u2206U can still be negative when\nT0 >\n\u223c \u03b5/g, which can be met for not-too-small g, a condition anyhow needed for having a sizeable effect. \u00bfFrom a\nthermodynamic point of view the gain can be seen as a\nflow of energy from a high temperature (of the spin) to\na lower one (of the bath), and the outside world (gain).\nFeasibility. Let us present several reasons favoring the\nfeasibility of the proposed setups: 1) Two-level systems\nare widespread, not the least because many quantum system act as two-level under proper conditions; 2) Detection in these systems is relatively easy, since already onetime quantities h~\u03c3 (t)i completely determine the state; 3)\nThe harmonic oscillator bath is universal [13]; 4) Work\nand heat were measured in NMR experiments more than\n35 years ago [14]; 5) Our main effects do survive the averaging over disordered ensembles of spins, thus allowing\nmany-spin measurements. 6) The ongoing activity for\nimplementation of quantum computers provides experimentally realized examples of two-level systems, which\nhave sufficiently long T2 times, and admit external variations on times smaller than T2 : (i) for atoms in optical traps T2 \u223c 1s, 1/\u0393 \u223c 10\u22128 s, and there are efficient\nmethods for creating non-equilibrium initial states and\nmanipulating atoms by external laser pulses [11]; (ii) for\nan electronic spin injected or optically excited in a semi-\n\n[1] E.L.
