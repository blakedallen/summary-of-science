The quasar\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nSDSSp J104433.04-012502.2 at z \u2248 5.8 (hereafter SDSS 1044-0125), discovered by Fan et al. (2000)\nusing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, is among the highest redshift objects known. Recent observations of this quasar with SCUBA on the JCMT at 850 \u03bcm detect thermal continuum emission\n(reported by Iwata et al. 2001), which suggests a large reservoir of dust and therefore also molecular\ngas. The presence of a substantial gas mass gains support from the apparent X-ray weakness of\nthe quasar, which likely results from heavy intrinsic absorption (Brandt et al. 2001, Mathur 2001).\nMolecular gas has been detected from at least a dozen z > 2 objects through CO lines at millimeter\nwavelengths, and these observations provide important clues to the formation history of galaxies\nand their relationship to supermassive black holes.\nA recent search for CO J=6\u20135 emission from SDSS 1044-0125 by Iwata et al. (2001) reported\nan upper limit on the inferred molecular gas mass comparable to the detections for some high\nredshift quasars. Unfortunately, the search was centered at z = 5.80, the initial redshift estimated\nby Fan et al. (2000). Recent spectroscopic studies of SDSS 1044-0125 give a more accurate value\nof z = 5.73 \u00b1 0.01 (Djorgovski et al. 2001, see also Goodrich et al. 2001), about 1% off from the\ninitial estimate. Because of the narrow instantaneous bandwidth available to current millimeter\ninterferometers, the revised redshift falls outside window that was searched for CO J=6\u20135 emission,\nand the observations likely missed the relevant redshifts for molecular gas in the quasar host. Since\nSDSS 1044-0125 has several properties in common with high redshift quasars where CO emission has\nbeen detected, (enumerated by Iwata et al. 2001), the revision of the optical redshift determination\ngives impetus to a new search for molecular gas.\nA potentially important limitation of searching for emission from CO lines with high rotational quantum numbers, like the J=6\u20135 transition, is that prevailing physical conditions may be\ninsufficiently extreme to excite these lines. The surprising detection of extended emission in the\nlow excitation CO J=2\u20131 line towards the quasar APM 08279+5255 at z = 3.91 (Papadopoulos et\nal. 2001) suggests that low excitation CO lines can reveal molecular mass reservoirs that are one\nor two orders of magnitude larger than suggested by observations of high excitation CO lines.\nIn this short paper, we present results of searches for CO J=2\u20131 and J=5\u20134 emission from\nSDSS 1044-0125 using the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array (BIMA)1 (Welch et al. 1996) that\nprovide new limits on the amount of molecular gas associated with this luminous high redshift\nquasar. The BIMA 1 cm band receiver system, which was developed primarily for observations of\nthe Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (Carlstrom, Joy & Grego 1996, Grego et al. 2000), provides a unique\nfacility to search for highly redshifted low lying CO lines. For SDSS 1044-0125, the CO J=2\u20131 line\nis redshifted to 34 GHz, within the accessible tuning range. The standard digital correlator allows\nfor several times larger velocity coverage than generally available at shorter wavelengths, sufficient\nto span the uncertainty in the quasar redshift determined from optical lines, as well as the typical\nkinematic offsets of molecular gas from the redshift derived optically. In addition, the small BIMA\n1\n\nThe BIMA array is operated by the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association under funding from the National\nScience Foundation.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\narray antennas provide a large field of view, which enables imaging the quasar environs over Mpc\nscales at 34 GHz in a single pointing.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nObservations\nCO J=2\u20131 Line\n\nObservations of the CO J=2\u20131 line (redshifted frequency 230.5380/(1 + 5.73) = 34.255 GHz)\nwere conducted in two parts, in September 2000 and September 2001. Both sets of observations\nused the 9 antennas of the BIMA array equipped with 1 cm band receivers. The pointing center\nwas \u03b1(J2000) = 10h 44m 33.s 04, \u03b4(J2000) = \u221201\u25e6 25.\u2032 02.\u2032\u2032 2. The 2000 observations, made with the\ncorrelator centered at the nominal redshift 5.80 estimated by Fan et al. (2000), were obtained on\n14 days, generally in short tracks of less than a few hours near source transit. The array antennas\nwere in C configuration, giving \u223c 25\u2032\u2032 resolution. The 2001 observations, made with the correlator\ncentered at the revised redshift 5.73 determined by Djorgovski et al. (2001), were obtained on 2\ndays in longer tracks. The array antennas were in B configuration, giving \u223c 8\u2032\u2032 resolution. For\nboth sets of observations, the hybrid correlator was configured with 8 individual windows, each\nwith 32 channels spanning 100 MHz, in some cases overlapped to avoid gaps at the window edges.\nThe system temperatures ranged from about 50 to 100 K (SSB). Short observations of the nearby\ncalibrator J1058+015 were made every half hour to track the interferometer phase and also for\nbandpass calibration. The flux scale was determined through observations of Mars that were used\nto set (constant) a priori gains for the individual array antennas; the minimal amplitude drifts of\nthe system at this low frequency suggest better than 10% accuracy.\nAll data calibration and imaging were performed using standard routines in the Miriad software\npackage. The visibility data were imaged with both natural and system temperature weighting for\nmaximum sensitivity. Since some frequencies were observed in both sets of observations, and some\nwere observed in only one or the other, there are three regimes for the synthesized beam sizes and\nrms noise levels. The frequency coverage and parameters of the resulting images are as follows,\nwhere the rms is quoted for a 200 km s\u22121 velocity bin (\u223c 8 channels), a resolution appropriate for\nthe linewidths of galactic potentials: (1) 33.82 to 34.23 GHz observed in both 2000 and 2001, beam\n24\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 15\u2032\u2032 p.a. 3\u25e6 , rms 0.86 mJy, (2) 33.48 to 33.82 GHz observed in 2000 only, beam 35\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 18\u2032\u2032\np.a. 7\u25e6 , rms 1.00 mJy, and (3) 34.23 to 34.55 GHz observed in 2001 only, beam 11\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 8\u2032\u2032 p.a.\n-15\u25e6 , rms 1.67 mJy. Note that the best sensitivity was achieved for the velocity range redshifted\nby up to a few thousand km s\u22121 from the (accurate) optical redshift\u2013 the range most likely to\ncontain CO emission. The typical kinematic offset of molecular emission in high redshift quasar\nhosts from optical lines is \u223c 500 km s\u22121 , with the largest known offset about 2500 km s\u22121 (in\nAPM 08279+5255, Downes et al. 1999).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.2.\n\nCO J=5\u20134 Line\n\nObservations of the CO J=5\u20134 line (redshifted frequency 576.2679220/(1+5.73) = 85.627 GHz)\nwere conducted on two days in October 2001. These observations used 10 antennas in D configuration, giving \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 resolution. As for the September 2001 observations with the 1 cm receiver\nsystem, the correlator was configured to span nearly 800 MHz centered near the revised redshift\nof z = 5.73. The system temperatures ranged from 150 to 600 K (SSB). Frequent observations of\nthe nearby calibrator J1058+015 were used to track amplitude and phase, and bandpass calibration was checked with short observations of the strong source 3C273. The flux density scale was\nderived from observations of Mars and should be accurate to 20%. The frequency coverage and\nparameters of the resulting images are: 85.22 to 85.92 GHz, beam 26\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032\u2032 p.a. 20\u25e6 , rms 3.0 mJy,\nfor 200 km s\u22121 resolution.\n\n3.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nFigure 1 shows the CO J=2\u20131 and CO J=5\u20134 spectra obtained at quasar position. The velocity\nbinnings for the two lines are 200 and 162 km s\u22121 , respectively. The noise in the CO J=2\u20131 spectrum\nis not uniform, and empirical \u00b11\u03c3 error bars derived from the rms noise measured from the images\nare shown for each velocity bin. There are some tantalizing hints of signal in adjacent channels\nclose to the expected velocities, but features with similar (low) significance are present elsewhere\nin the data, and we do not consider any of these features to be reliable line detections. Figure 2\nshows a series of maps with 200 km s\u22121 width that span the full half power field of view (6.\u2032 6) for\nthe J=2\u20131 line. Various attempts at smoothing in both space and frequency did not uncover any\nsignificant CO emission in either of the observed transitions.\nTwo mechanisms have been suggested for heating large masses of dust and gas in high redshift\nquasar systems: (1) high energy photons emitted from gases accreted onto a massive black hole\nand (2) bursts of star formation. If the dust is heated by the activity of a massive black hole, then\nbright emission may be expected from high excitation CO lines in a compact region close to the\nexciting source, from large amounts of warm, dense gas involved in fueling and accretion. The CO\nJ=5\u20134 line, whose upper energy level lies 88 K above the ground state, requires warm gas (> 30 K)\nat high densities (> 103 cm\u22123 ) to be populated significantly by H2 collisions. Consequently, the\nupper limits on CO emission from the J=5\u20134 line constrains primarily the amount of molecular gas\nwith these conditions close to the massive black hole or other powerful heating sources. On the\nother hand, such extreme physical conditions are not necessarily appropriate for starbursts, which\nare likely to be distributed over larger spatial scales and involve cooler, more diffuse molecular gas.\nIf the dust is heated by primarily by star formation, then emission in CO J=2\u20131 line may be a\nmore appropriate tracer of molecular gas content, given that the upper energy level lies just 16 K\nabove ground and the excitation requirements are significantly less stringent.\nFollowing Solomon, Downes & Radford (1992), we calculate upper limits to CO line luminosities\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nwith the expression\n\u2032\n\n\u22122 2\nLCO = 3.25 \u00d7 107 SCO \u2206v\u03bdobs\nDL (1 + z)\u22123\n\nK km s\u22121 pc2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere SCO \u2206v is the limit on the velocity integrated line flux in Jy km s\u22121 , \u03bdobs is the observing\nfrequency in GHz, and DL is the luminosity distance in Mpc. The choice of cosmological parameters\nenters in DL , and we adopt H0 = 75 km s\u22121 , \u03a9 = 1 and \u03a9\u039b = 0 for consistency with most work\nin this field. (An alternative cosmology with H0 = 75 km s\u22121 , \u03a9 = 1 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 results in DL\nlarger by a factor of 1.54 for this redshift.) The effective linewidth is not known, but it likely falls in\nthe range 150 to 550 km s\u22121 found for a large sample of ultraluminous galaxies in the local universe\n(Solomon et al. 1997). For the 3\u03c3 flux limit obtained in the more sensitive part of the CO J=2\u20131\n\u2032\nspectrum, assuming a linewidth of 200 km s\u22121 , LCO (2 \u2212 1) < 5.1 \u00d7 1010 K km s\u22121 pc2 . For the 3\u03c3\n\u2032\nflux limit obtained for CO J=5\u20134, again assuming a linewidth of 200 km s\u22121 , LCO (5\u22124) < 3.0\u00d71010\nK km s\u22121 pc2 . If the assumed linewidth were two times larger, then these luminosity limits would\n\u221a\nbe 2 times higher.\nConversion of these CO luminosity limits to molecular gas mass limits is fraught with uncertainties. But a simple conversion factor from CO luminosity to H2 mass is commonly taken to be\n4.5 M\u2299 (K km s\u22121 pc2 )\u22121 , the value determined for Milky Way molecular clouds (Sanders, Scoville\n& Soifer 1991). There is evidence from comparisons of luminosity based mass estimates with dynamical mass estimates that the conversion factor may be perhaps five times lower in ultraluminous\nobjects (Downes & Solomon 1998). Additional corrections of order unity are also needed to account\nproperly for excitation from the elevated cosmic background radiation at high redshift. Adopting\nthe Galactic conversion factor for CO J=2\u20131 line luminosity gives a limit on the cold or diffuse\nmolecular gas mass of \u223c 2.3 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 in the SDSS 1044-0125 system. Using the same conversion\nfactor for the CO J=5\u20134 line luminosity gives a limit on the warm and dense molecular gas mass\nof of \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 in the SDSS 1044-0125 system.\nThese mass limits are comparable to the mass indicated from the detection of CO J=5\u20134 emission from some z > 4 quasars, including at least two thought not to be amplified by gravitational\nlensing. In particular, observations of CO J=5\u20134 emission from BR1202-0725 at z = 4.7 (Omont\nal. 1996, Ohta et al. 1996) and BRI1335-0417 at z = 4.4 (Guilloteau et al. 1997) indicate molecular gas masses in excess of 1011 M\u2299 (adjusted for the cosmology and CO to H2 conversion factor\nadopted here). There is no clear physical argument to explain why some quasar environments show\nCO emission at this sensitivity level while others do not (Guilloteau et al. 1999). In any case, the\nCO J=2\u20131 and J=5\u20134 luminosity limits suggest that the environment of SDSS 1044-0125 does not\npossess an enormous mass reservoir of either low excitation or high excitation molecular gas.\nThe CO J=2\u20131 limit is comparable to the amount of molecular gas detected toward the lensed\nquasar APM 08279+5255, where Papadopoulos et al. (2001) found several CO J=2\u20131 emission\nfeatures with total luminosity 6.6 \u00b1 3.1 \u00d7 1011 K km s\u22121 pc2 attributed to (unlensed) molecular gas\nrich companion galaxies to the quasar host. For the SDSS 1044-0125 observations, such features\nwould have been contained within one synthesized beam (together with any nuclear emission). The\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nluminosity limit suggests that no comparable population of nearby massive companions is present.\nMoreover, no significant CO J=2\u20131 emission features are found within the entire field of view that\nspans \u223c 1.4 Mpc, which suggests that such massive cold molecular gas concentrations are rare.\nObservations of SDSS 1044-0125 with better sensitivity are needed to explore whether smaller but\nstill significant concentrations of low excitation molecular gas are present in the environment of\nthis high redshift quasar.\nThe work was supported in part by NSF grant AST-21795 to the University of California.
