It is approximately chirally\nsymmetric.\n\n1. Introduction\nRob Pisarski and I recently proposed the existence of Quarkyonic Matter [1]. These arguments were originally in the context of the large number of colors approximation, Nc \u2192 \u221e with\nthe number of quark flavors held fixed, N f finite. The arguments were then generalized to the\nlarge Nc limit, with N f /Nc fixed [2]. Computations based on he PNJL model,[3],[4],[5] were subsequently performed that argued that such a phase of matter may occur in systems with Nc = 3,\nand that the quarkyonic transition might be associated with chiral symmetry restoration[6]-[7].\nIn the paper with Redlich and Sasaki, a model was proposed that could continuously vary Nc ,\nand the behaviour of the phase transition boundaries could be studied as a function of Nc .[7] A\npicture of the revised phase diagram of QCD is shown in Fig. 1 The purpose of this talk is to\nprovide a brief explanation of these developments.\n\nT\u2191\nTc\n\nQuark-Gluon Plasma\nTriple Point\n\nDeconfinement\n\n\u2190Chiral?\nHadronic\n\nQuarkyonic\n\nLiquid-Gas X\n\nMN\n\nPairing\n\n\u03bcB\u2192\n\nFigure 1: The revised phase diagram of QCD\nPreprint submitted to Nuclear Physics A\n\nNovember 5, 2018\n\n\fThe work on Quarkyonic matter provides perhaps the most recent study of new phases of\nmatter at high baryon number density. There have been numerous speculations concerning high\nbaryon number density matter, the most recent being work on color superconductivity [8],[9].\nThe properties of matter at finite baryon number density were in fact the first studies done in\nQCD concerning the properties of matter at very high energy density [10], and a history of the\nearly developments in this area are reviewed in Ref. [11]. An issue that the work on Quarkyonic\nmatter seeks to clarify is the relationship between confinement and high energy density matter.\nOur conclusion is somewhat surprising: Quarkyonic matter can have densities parametrically\nlarge compared to the QCD scale and still be confined. The experimental study of such matter\nmotivated early discussion of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions [12], [13], and will be the\nsubject of future studies at RHIC, FAIR and NICA.\n2. The Large N c Approximation\nThe large Nc approximation is the limit where the number of colors of QCD is taken to be\nvery large, but the coupling strength \u03bb = g2 Nc /4\u03c0 is fixed. This theory is asymptotically free,\nand confining in vacuum. There is a Hagedorn spectrum of mesons, and mesons made of quarks\ninteract with strength 1/Nc and glueballs with strength 1/Nc2 . Baryons are made of Nc quarks,\nhave a mass of order Nc \u039bQCD and interact strongly with strength Nc .\nAt finite temperature and zero baryon number density, the low temperature phase is composed\nof light mass mesons. The number of degrees of freedom are of order one in the number of colors.\nAt very low temperature, the Goldstone degrees of freedom are important, and there are N 2f \u2212 1\ndegrees of freedom. Baryon degrees of freedom vanish in the confined phase since e\u2212MB /T \u223c e\u2212Nc\nAt very high temperatures, the degrees of freedom are 2(Nc2 \u2212 1) + 4Nc N f arising from the gluons\nand quarks. Baryon degrees of freedom are unsuppressed in the Quark Gluon Plasma.\nSince the number of degrees of freedom is of order one in the hadron phase and is of order\nNc2 in the Quark Gluon Plasma, there must be a jump in the energy density at a de-confinement\ntemperature. Viewed from the perspective of the hadron phase, thee is a limiting temperature\nwhere the energy density diverges. For finite but large Nc , at the Hagedron limiting temperature,\nthe density of mesons becomes enormous, and at some point they must interact with one another.\nAs this occurs, one makes a transition to a Quark Gluon Plasma, that has a large but finite number\nof degrees of freedom. The rapid cross over for QCD at Nc = 3 is a remnant of this Hagedorn\ntransition of large Nc QCD [14].\nAt finite baryon density, we see that e(\u03bcB \u2212MB )/T will be of order e\u2212Nc for \u03bcB much less than\nMb . In fact unless (\u03bcB \u2212 MN )/MN \u223c 1/Nc , the baryon number density is exponentially small.\nTherefore when \u03bcB is MN , there is a baryon number generating transition. Of course, due to\nthe very strong interactions of baryons in the large Nc limit, the threshold for baryon number\ngeneration is not the free nucleon mass, but is the mass of a nucleon in bound nuclear matter.\nHigh density baryonic matter however remains confined. The contribution of fermion loops\nis suppressed by \u03bb\u03bc2Q /Nc , where \u03bcQ = \u03bcB /Nc is a quark chemical potential. Such loops cannot\n\u221a\nDebye screen the confining potential until \u03bcQ \u223c Nc \u039bQCD This means that the de-confinement\nphase transition is independent of baryon density In spite of the fact that the baryonic matter is\nconfined, at high density the typical bulk quantities such as pressure and energy density should\nbe described by a weakly coupled gas of quarks. This is because for particles inside a Fermi sea,\ninteractions are not infrared sensitive, and bulk quantities should be dominated by quark kinetic\nenergies.\n2\n\n\fThis matter that is simultaneously confined and yet has its energy density and pressure well\napproximated by a quasi-free gas of quarks, Rob Pisarski and I have named as Quarkyonic.\nFor Nc = 3, the phase transitions of the large Nc world can become cross overs. The Quarkyonic transition remains at \u03bcB = MN for T = 0, since this is the physical threshold for producing\nbaryon number. As T is increased, presumably the transition is at small \u03bcB . At high density, the\nconfinement transition should become weaker since the effect of quarks will begin to reduce the\neffect of the confinement temperature at higher density. It also should move to lower values of T\nas \u03bcB increases. The width of the Quarkyonic transition is estimated from the baryon chemical\npotential which for Fermi momenta kF << MN , \u03bcB = MN + k2F /2MN = MN (1 + O(1/Nc2 ), since\nthe transition should be completed when kF \u223c \u039bQCD .\n3. Physical Picture of Quarkyonic Matter\nThe Hadron Phase is composed of mesons and glueballs. In the large Nc limit, there are no\nbaryons. The number of Goldstone degrees of freedom are N 2f \u2212 1 The Quark Gluon Plasma is\ncomposed of quarks and gluons with 2(Nc2 \u2212 1) + 4N f Nc degrees of freedom.\nThe Quarkyonic phase is composed of quarks, mesons and glueballs. The number of quark\ndegrees of freedom are 2Nc N f and in addition there are N 2f \u2212 1 Goldstone boson degrees of\nfreedom. The transition between these various phases should be thought of as a change in the\nnumber of degrees of freedom in a narrow range of temperature and baryon chemical potential. A\nphenomenological parameterization that embodies these constraints should be straightforward.\nThe quarkyonic phase can be thought of as a Fermi gas composed of quasi-free quarks. Near\nthe Fermi surface the degrees of freedom are confined baryons. The thermal excitations are\nmesons and glueballs. Color superconductivity in the quarkyonic phase would not be allowed in\nthe large Nc limit, but surely for finite Nc such phenomena are possible.\nOne can understand the Quarkyonic transition in large Nc with fixed Nc /N f in a simple way:\nFor large N f there are exponentially large numbers of degenerate lowest mass baryon states,\nN \u223c eNc F(Nc /N f ) . Near the Quarkyoninc transitions, these states become important, since the\nprobability that they contribution can be of order e(Nc F(Nc /N f )\u03bcB /T \u2212MN /T ) The accumulating density\nis however rapidly cutoff by the strong interactions of the baryons.\nThe nature of chiral symmetry breaking is not so simple to understand. In the high density\nphase, one expects that the effects of high density matter may lower or perhaps reduce to zero\nthe chiral quark condensate [15],[16],[17],[18],[19]. Intuitively, this is because a high baryon\ndensity will exclude quarks unless they have energy near the Fermi surface. This means that\nif pairs form, they arise from particle hole pairs near the Fermi surface . It is indeed possible\nthat pairing phenomena near the Fermi surface might generate chiral symmetry breaking through\nchiral density waves [20]-[21]. These pairs would break the translational invariance and a crystal\nwould result [22]. (In previous considerations of chiral density waves, it was assumed that the\npotential between quarks was Coulombic. In Quarkyonic matter, the potential should be linear,\nand the possibility of condensation may be easier to realize.)\nOne can question whether or not the large Nc limit is applicable for Nc = 3. On the plus side\nof the equation is the fact that quarks seem to little influence the confining potential in vacuum\nout to a distance of about 2 f m, as seen from lattice Monte-Carlo computations. The linear\npotential begins at a distance of about 0.2 f m. One may expect that there is some finite range\nof density before media quarks may short out the potential, so there is room for a Quarkyonic\nphase. There have also been model computations that argue for a Quarkyonic phase [6],[7].\n3\n\n\fThese computations also argue that the chiral transition is approximately coincident with the\nQuarkyonic transition.\nThe negative side follows from some generic features of the large Nc limit that are not observed in baryons. The large Nc limit predicts that pion exchange has an intrinsic strength of\norder Nc at large distances. This requires that the ground state of large Nc baryonic matter is a\nSkyrme crystal [22]. On the other hand nuclear matter for Nc = 3 is a liquid, not a solid, and the\nbiding energy is of order 15 MeV, not of order the nucleon mass. Moreover, lattice gauge theory\ncomputations argue that at long and intermediate distance, the nuclear force is not of strength\nof order Nc . How these facts become consistent with the large Nc approximation is a mystery.\nPerhaps the small binding energy of nuclear matter is an accident peculiar to Nc = 3. If not, then\nwe do not understand something fundamental about the nature of QCD.\nAcknowledgments\nI thank my colleague Rob Pisarski, Yoshimasa Hidaka, Krzysztof Redlich, Chhiro Sasaki and\nToru Kojo with whom I have collaborated in the development of these ideas.
