The most common\ndescription for a BEC is through a macroscopic wave function \u03c8 : Rd 7\u2192 C which modulus squared will\ngive the matter density profile. Here d = 2, 3 and in this paper we will focus on a situation where it is\nphysically justified to consider a two-dimensional BEC. For a condensate at equilibrium in the rotating\nframe, this wave function should minimize the following Gross-Pitaevskii functional\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n\u03a92 2\nG 4\n1\n2\n\u22a5\n2\nGP\n\u2207\u03c8 \u2212 i\u03a9x \u03c8 + V (x) \u2212\n|x| |\u03c8| + |\u03c8| dx,\n(1.1)\nE [\u03c8] =\n2\n2\n2\nR2\nunder the mass constraint\n\nZ\n\n|\u03c8|2 = 1.\n\n(1.2)\n\nR2\n\nHere x = (x1 , x2 ) \u2208 R2 , x\u22a5 = (\u2212x2 , x1 ), \u03a9 is the angular velocity at which the condensate is rotated\naround the axis perpendicular to the plane x1 , x2 and G is a dimensionless coefficient characterizing the\nstrength of atomic interactions. An essential feature of the experimental set-ups is the trapping potential,\ndenoted by V in (1.1). It is this potential that confines the atoms in a bounded region and prevents them\nfrom flying apart under the action of the centrifugal forces. For most experiments it takes the form (in\nthe appropriate units that we have implicitly chosen in (1.1))\nV (x) =\n\n1 2\n|x| .\n2\n\n(1.3)\n\nSuch a potential sets a limit to the rotational speed \u03a9 that one can impose to the condensate. Indeed, one\ncan see that with V chosen as above the second term in (1.1) is not bounded below if \u03a9 > 1. Consequently\nthe minimization problem makes no sense. Physically this corresponds to the fact that the centrifugal\nforce overcomes the trapping force and drives the condensate out of the trap.\nTo prevent such a singular behavior in the limit \u03a9 \u2192 1, Fetter [Fe2] proposed to use instead a potential\nof the form\n1\nk\nV (x) = |x|2 + |x|4\n(1.4)\n2\n4\nwhich, at least theoretically, allows for arbitrarily large rotation speeds \u03a9. Such a potential is a good\napproximation for those that have been used in the experiments ([BSS, SBC]) and this is the one we\nshall consider in this paper.\nAn important experimental test for the superfluidity of a BEC is the observation of quantized\nvortices, which are described in Gross-Pitaevskii theory as zeros of the wave function carrying a positive\ntopological degree or winding number (corresponding to the quantized phase circulation around the\nvortex). When a BEC is rotated, it will contain more and more vortices as the rotation speed is\nincreased, until they become densely packed in the condensate when \u03a9 approaches 1. Vortices repel each\nother, and to minimize this effect they will arrange on regular hexagonal lattices when \u03a9 \u2192 1, for both\nthe harmonic trap (1.3) and the 'anharmonic' one (1.4). These Abrikosov lattices (named by analogy\nwith the physics of type II superconductors, [Abr]) have been observed experimentally, see e.g. [ARV]\nfor experiments with the trap (1.3) and [BSS] for experiments with the trap (1.4). It should be noted\nthat all vortices in these lattices are simply quantized, i.e. they have degree 1.\nA striking new feature of the trap (1.4) is the possibility to create annular condensates by increasing\nthe rotation speed beyond the barrier that would be imposed by a weaker confinement. Indeed, for\n\n\f3\n\nsufficiently large rotation speeds, the centrifugal forces will dip a hole in the center of the condensate.\nInteresting questions then arise about the vortex structure of the condensate. For example : does\nthe hexagonal vortex lattice survive the formation of the hole ? When the hole has just formed the\nanswer is yes, see [FJS, FB, KB] for references in the physics literature and [CY] for a mathematically\nrigorous treatment. At very large rotation speeds however, the vortices disappear from the bulk of the\ncondensate, resulting in a so-called giant vortex phase, a situation that we do not address here and for\nwhich we refer to [FJS, FB, KB, KF] for physical references and [CRY, Rou] for a mathematical analysis.\nThe locations of vortices in the central hole of low matter density can also be investigated. It is\ncommonly known (see e.g. [FJS, KB, KTU]) that there should be a phase circulation around this hole,\nindicating that vortices lie within it. In regions of high matter density, it is most favorable for the\nvortices to have degree 1, but it is far from obvious that it should also be the case in regions of low\nmatter density. In particular, a question arising naturally [ABD, FJS] is wether the vortices in the\ncentral hole of an annular Bose-Einstein condensate gather in a single multiply quantized vortex or form\na pattern of simply quantized ones.\nIn this paper we address the case of a two-dimensional annular Bose-Einstein condensate rotating\nin a potential of the form (1.4). We will study the formation of the annular condensate by taking the\nlimit k \u2192 0 of the problem, with the rotation speed \u03a9 properly scaled so as to capture the regime where\nthe central hole is created under the influence of the centrifugal force. In such a parameter regime it\nis physically justified to consider a simplified variational problem that we describe in the next section.\nThe very particular structure of the variational space considered allows to obtain interesting theoretical\nresults. It also suggests a very natural numerical minimization method that we have used to confirm and\nextend our analytical results. The results we are going to present first appeared in a note intended for\nphysicists [BR] to which we refer for further physical discussion (see also [AM]).\n\n1.1\n\nThe GP energy and the LLL reduction\n\nWe consider the GP energy functional\nZ \u0012\n1\nGP\n\u2207\u03c8 \u2212 i\u03a9x\u22a5 \u03c8\nE [\u03c8] =\n2\n2\nR\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1 \u2212 \u03a92 2 k 4\nG 4\n2\n|x| + |x| |\u03c8| + |\u03c8| dx,\n2\n4\n2\n\n(1.5)\n\nto be minimized under the mass constraint\nZ\n\n|\u03c8|2 = 1.\n\n(1.6)\n\nR2\n\nThe main idea of our analysis is to restrict the minimization of E GP to the first eigenspace of the Ginzburg\u00012\nLandau operator \u2212 \u2207 \u2212 i\u03a9x\u22a5 , corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03a9. This is the Lowest Landau Level\n(LLL), introduced in the context of Bose-Einstein condensation by Ho [Ho].\nThe use of such a simplification has originally been introduced for condensates rotating in traps of the\nform (1.3), i.e. for the functional\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n1\n1 \u2212 \u03a92 2 2 G 4\n2\nE GP [\u03c8] =\n\u2207\u03c8 \u2212 i\u03a9x\u22a5 \u03c8 +\n|x| |\u03c8| + |\u03c8| dx.\n(1.7)\n2\n2\n2\nR2\nRestricting the minimization to the LLL is then justified in the limit \u03a9 \u2192 1. Indeed, the first term in the\n\u00012\nenergy is at least equal to \u03a9 \u223c 1 since \u03a9 is the first eigenvalue of \u2212 \u2207 \u2212 i\u03a9x\u22a5 . On the other hand,\nthe second term will obviously be small in the same limit. Thus, minimizing the sum of the second and\nthe third term one also obtains something much smaller than \u03a9.\nThis indicates that the energy must stay close to \u03a9 when \u03a9 \u2192 1. But the spectral gap between the first\n\n\f4\n\nand the second eigenvalue of the Ginzburg-Landau operator is equal to \u03a9. To obtain an energy of order\n\u00012\n\u03a9 the projection of a minimizer of the functional (1.7) on the excited energy levels of \u2212 \u2207 \u2212 i\u03a9x\u22a5\nmust then be negligible.\nThis formal justification has been the basis of several works on harmonically trapped BECs in the regime\n\u03a9 \u2192 1, e.g. [ABD, CKR, WBP]. A rigorous justification has been given in [AB2]. For other mathematical developments on the functional (1.7) in the regime \u03a9 \u2192 1 (Landau regime), we refer to [AB1, ABN2].\n2\n\nThe LLL consists (see e.g [LP]) of functions of the form \u03c8(z) = f (z)e\u2212\u03a9|z| /2 where z is the complex\nvariable x1 + ix2 and f is a holomorphic function. For an LLL function \u03c8, the Gross-Pitaevskii energy\n(1.5) reduces to (we denote dz = dx1 dx2 )\n\u0013\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\u0012\nG 4\n1 \u2212 \u03a92 2 k 4\nGP\n2\nE [\u03c8] = \u03a9 +\n|z| + |z| |\u03c8| + |\u03c8| dz.\n2\n4\n2\nC\n2\n\nIn this paper we will rather consider functions of the form \u03c8(z) = f (z)e\u2212|z| /2 (thus we effectively restrict\n\u00012\nthe minimization to the first eigenspace of \u2212 \u2207 \u2212 ix\u22a5 ) to have a functional space independent of \u03a9.\nThis approximation is harmless because, as we will see, our analysis is concerned with rotation speeds \u03a9\nclose to 1. As for the energy, the difference is very small as showed by [AB2, Lemma 3.1] : with \u03c8 of the\n2\nform \u03c8(z) = f (z)e\u2212|z| /2 with f holomorphic we have\nE GP [\u03c8]\n\n=\n\nE LLL [\u03c8]\n\n=\n\n\u03a9 + E LLL [\u03c8]\n\u0013\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\u0012\nG 4\nk 4\n2\n2\n(1 \u2212 \u03a9) |z| + |z| |\u03c8| + |\u03c8| dz,\n4\n2\nC\n\n(1.8)\n(1.9)\n2\n\nso that we will minimize the energy E LLLR amongst functions of the form \u03c8(z) = f (z)e\u2212|z| /2 with f\nholomorphic, under the mass constraint |\u03c8|2 = 1. For this purpose we will use the mathematical\nframework introduced in [ABN1, ABN2] for the study of the functional (1.7). See also [Nie2] for the\ncorresponding dynamical model.\nNote that the validity of such a reduction could be investigated with the tools of [AB2] (as well as the\nvalidity of the reduction to a two-dimensional model), but in this paper we shall be concerned only\nwith the study of the reduced energy functional E LLL . We will provide in Subsection 1.3 an a posteriori\ncriterion for the validity of the reduction.\nWe now describe the parameter regime that we shall consider. Let us define a small parameter\n\u03b5 = k 1/3\n\n(1.10)\n\ncorresponding to a small anharmonicity regime and study the asymptotics of the problem as \u03b5 \u2192 0.

We are able, using the Szeg\u00f6 projector (1.16) to derive the Euler-Lagrange equation satisfied\nby any solution of the minimization problem. Using this equation and the very particular structure of the\nFock-Bargmann space (in particular the constraint that f has to be analytic) we are able to derive that\nany minimizer must have an infinite number of zeros (vortices) if \u03b5 is small enough. We also construct\nalmost critical points, functions that are solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation up to a small remainder\nterm. Evaluating the energy of these almost critical points yields an upper bound to the energy that we\nbelieve is optimal although we are not able to prove it. This upper bound will be useful to discuss the\nvalidity of the LLL reduction in Subsection 1.3 below.\n\n\f6\n\n1.2\n\nMain Analytical Results\n\nLet us start by showing that the problem we want to consider is actually well-posed :\nTheorem 1.1 (Well-posedness and Euler-Lagrange equation).\nFor any \u03b5 > 0 fixed, the problem (1.22) admits a solution in F2\u03b5 . Any minimizer is a solution to\n\u2212\u03b2M\u03b5 f +\n\n\u0001\n2\n1\nM\u03b52 f + \u03b5M\u03b5 f + G\u03a0\u03b5 (e\u2212|z| /\u03b5 |f |2 f ) = \u03bcf\n4\n\n(1.23)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the Lagrange multiplier coming from the mass constraint and M\u03b5 is the operator defined by\nM\u03b5 f = \u03b5\u2202z (zf ) .\n\n(1.24)\n\nAlternatively, the Euler-Lagrange equation (1.23) may be written\n\u0001\n2\n1\n1\n(\u2212\u03b2 + \u03b5)\u03a0\u03b5 (|z|2 f ) + \u03a0\u03b5 |z|2 \u03a0\u03b5 (|z|2 f ) + G\u03a0\u03b5 (\u2212|z| /\u03b5 |f |2 f ) = \u03bcf\n4\n4\nor\n\u2212\u03b2M\u03b5 f +\n\n\u0001 G\n1\nM\u03b52 f + \u03b5M\u03b5 f + f \u0304(\u03b5\u2202z )[f 2 (z/2)] = \u03bcf,\n4\n2\n\n(1.25)\n\n(1.26)\n\nwhere the operator f \u0304(\u03b5\u2202z ) is defined as\nf \u0304(\u03b5\u2202z )[g] :=\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nak (\u03b5\u2202z )k g\n\nk=0\n\nif f (z) =\n\nP+\u221e\n\nk=0\n\nak z k .\n\nNext we show that a minimizer of (1.22) cannot have a finite number of zeros if \u03b5 is small enough. In\nparticular, the minimum cannot be achieved by a polynomial.\nTheorem 1.2 (Infinite number of zeros).\nIf \u03b5 is sufficiently small, any solution to the minimization problem (1.22) has an infinite number of zeros.\nWe will discuss this result in further details in Subsection 1.3 and now describe the procedure we\nfollow to construct approximate solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation (1.25).\nAs is the case for harmonically trapped condensates in fast rotation, we expect that in the range of\nparameters we explore the scales of the problem will decouple. Namely we expect any minimizer of (1.20)\nto be of the form \u03b1u where u varies on the scale of the vortex pattern (which is small compared to the\nsize of the condensate) and \u03b1 is a slow varying profile giving the general shape of the condensate. The\nkind of profile \u03b1 we have in mind is a Thomas-Fermi distribution. More precisely, \u03b1 should look like a\nminimizer of the energy (1.20) without the holomorphy constraint. Such a function has compact support\nand can thus not be in the LLL, but one can approach it by an LLL function which is an almost critical\npoint for the energy (1.20). We proceed as follow. Let us introduce\n\u0013\n\u0012r\n\u03c4I\n\u2212|z|2 /2\u03b5\nz 2 /2\u03b5\nz, \u03c4\n(1.27)\nu\u03c4 (z) = e\nf\u03c4 (z), f\u03c4 (z) = e\n\u0398\n\u03c0\u03b5\nwhere \u03c4 = \u03c4R + i\u03c4I is any complex number and\n\u0398(v, \u03c4 ) =\n\n+\u221e\n2\n1 X\n(\u22121)n ei\u03c0\u03c4 (n+1/2) e(2n+1)\u03c0iv\ni n=\u2212\u221e\n\n(1.28)\n\n\f7\n\nis the Jacobi \u0398 function (more precisely the \u03980 function according to the classification of [Nie1]). It has\nthe property (see [Cha] for more details)\n\u0398(v + k + l\u03c4, \u03c4 ) = (\u22121)k+l e\u22122i\u03c0lv e\u2212i\u03c0l\u03c4 \u0398(v, \u03c4 ).\n\n(1.29)\n\nThe interest of introducing such functions\nis twofold.\nFirstly it is known [Cha] that any function v whose\nq\nq\n\u03c0\u03b5\n\u03c0\u03b5\nmodulus is periodic over the lattice\n\u03c4I Z \u2295\n\u03c4I Z\u03c4 , vanishes exactly on the points of the lattice with\n2\n\nsimple zeros and such that g = ve|z| /2\u03b5 is holomorphic must be proportional to u\u03c4 . Secondly, the function\nf\u03c4 is a solution to the Abrikosov problem (see e.g. [Abr] and [ABN2, Section 4] for a detailed discussion)\nZ\n2 \u2212|z|2 /\u03b5\n\u03a0\u03b5 (|f\u03c4 | e\nf\u03c4 ) = \u03bb\u03c4 f\u03c4 , with \u03bb\u03c4 = \u2212 |u\u03c4 |2 b(\u03c4 ),\n(1.30)\nand\n\n\u2212 |u\u03c4 |4\n\nR\nb(\u03c4 ) = R\n\n\u2212 |u\u03c4 |2\n\n2\n\nX\n\n\u00012 =\n\ne\u2212\u03c0|k\u03c4 \u2212l|\n\n/\u03c4I\n\n.\n\n(1.31)\n\nk,l\u2208Z\n\nR\nHere we denote \u2212 v the average of a periodic function v. Equation (1.30) is similar to (1.25) without\nthe potential term and with \u03bc = \u03bb\u03c4 so that one can expect to obtain a solution of (1.25) by a slight\nmodification of f\u03c4 . We refer to [ABN1, ABN2] and references therein for details on the quantity b(\u03c4 ).\nLet us just mention that it is minimum (b(\u03c4 ) \u223c 1.16) for \u03c4 = e2i\u03c0/3 , which corresponds to a hexagonal\nlattice. From now on we take\n\u03c4 = e2i\u03c0/3\nand denote b = b(e2i\u03c0/3 ).\nTo obtain\nour approximate solutions we first multiply f\u03c4 by a slow varying profile \u03b1 with compact support\nR\nand R2 |\u03b1|2 = 1. This trial state would correspond to having a regular hexagonal lattice of vortices in the\nbulk of the condensate (that is, the support of \u03b1). To obtain an admissible test function for the problem\n(1.22) we project \u03b1f\u03c4 onto the Fock-Bargmann space and normalize it :\nf\u03b1,\u03c4 =\n\n\u03a0\u03b5 (\u03b1f\u03c4 )\n.\nk\u03a0\u03b5 (\u03b1f\u03c4 )kF\u03b5\n\n(1.32)\n\nAccordingly\n2\n\nu\u03b1,\u03c4 = f\u03b1,\u03c4 e\u2212|z|\n\n/2\u03b5\n\n.\n\n(1.33)\n\nAs for the choice of the appropriate \u03b1, it turns out to be related to the following Thomas-Fermi energy\nfunctional :\n\u0013\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\u0012\n1 4\nbG 2\nTF\n2\nEb [\u03c1] =\n\u2212\u03b2|z| + |z| \u03c1 +\n\u03c1 dz.\n(1.34)\n4\n2\nC\nThe associated minimization problem is\n\u001a\nZ\nEbTF := inf EbTF [\u03c1] , \u03c1 \u2265 0,\n\n|z|2 \u03c1 < +\u221e,\n\nZ\n\nR2\n\n\u001b\n\u03c1=1 .\n\n(1.35)\n\nR2\n\nIts solution is unique and given as\n\u03c1TF\nb\n\n\u0012\n:= max\n\n1\n4\n2\n\u03bcTF\nb + \u03b2|z| \u2212 4 |z|\n,0\nbG\n\n\u0013\n(1.36)\n\nwhere the chemical potential \u03bcTF\nappears as a Lagrange\nb\nR multiplier in the equation associated to the\nminimization (1.35) ans is thus fixed by the constraint R2 \u03c1TF\n= 1. Note that there exists a critical\nb\nvalue \u03b2c such that the support of such a function becomes an annulus when \u03b2 > \u03b2c (see the discussion\n\n\f8\n\nin Section 1.3). This is in contrast with the situation where k = 0 (purely quadratic trap) where the\nsupport of the TF minimizer is always a disc.\nWe have the following result :\nTheorem 1.3 (Almost critical points).\nLet \u03b1 be a profile satisfying\n2\n\n|\u03b1(z)| = \u03c1TF\nb\n\n(1.37)\n\nand f\u03b1,\u03c4 be the associated function via formula (1.32).

It\nis known from the experiments that in the regime we consider, the condensate should contain a very\nlarge number of vortices. Theorem 1.2 also suggests to use a trial function containing as many vortices\nas possible, although it does not give information on their locations. On the other hand the trapping\npotential will force the condensate to live essentially in a bounded region, the complement of which will\nbe a region of very low matter density. It is natural to think that, at least in the bulk, the vortices will\nform a regular hexagonal lattice. This is widely observed in experiments and numerical simulations.\nCombining these two requirements, we arrive at a trial function of the form c\u03b1f\u03c4 where f\u03c4 is defined in\n(1.27), \u03b1 is a function with compact support and c a normalization factor. Such a function is of course\nnot in the Fock-Bargmann space : it has compact support and thus cannot be holomorphic. To obtain\nan admissible trial state we project it onto F\u03b5 using the Szeg\u00f6 projector. Computing the energy of such\na trial function consists of essentially two steps (see Subsection 2.3 for the detailed proof). First, using\na remarkable result from [ABN2] we have (see Lemma 2.1 below for a precise statement)\n\u03a0\u03b5 (\u03b1f\u03c4 ) \u223c \u03b1f\u03c4\nwhen \u03b5 \u2192 0. Thus the projection onto the Fock-Bargmann space has no effect on the energy to leading\norder and we obtain\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n2\n1 4\n2\nF LLL [f\u03b1,\u03c4 ] \u223c k\u03a0\u03b5 (\u03b1f\u03c4 )k\u22122\n\u2212\u03b2|z|\n+\n|z|\n|\u03b1|2 |f\u03c4 |2 e\u2212|z| /\u03b5 dz\nF\u03b5\n4\nC\nZ\n2\nG\n+ k\u03a0\u03b5 (\u03b1f\u03c4 )k\u22124\n|\u03b1|4 |f\u03c4 |4 e\u22122|z| /\u03b5 dz.\nF\u03b5\n2 C\n\n\f9\n2\n\nNow, |f\u03c4 |e\u2212|z| /2\u03b5 = |u\u03c4 | is periodic over a lattice whose period is very small (\u221d \u03b51/2 ), whereas \u03b1 is chosen\nwith a support of fixed size.

One should note that\nthe only contribution of the vortex structure to the leading order of the energy is through the coefficient\nb, which depends on the type of lattice we choose and is minimum for the hexagonal lattice.\nWe do believe that this construction is optimal, but a proof of a lower bound matching (1.40) would\nprobably require to show that the vortices of a true minimizer of the energy are located close to the\nsites of a regular lattice. This is a difficult question, linked to the crystallization problem, and remains a\nchallenging open problem in more than one context, see [ABN2, SS] and references therein.\nWe have however the easy but non-optimal lower bound\nE1TF \u2264 F LLL\n\n(1.41)\n\nwhere E1TF is defined by taking b = 1 in (1.35). This follows by minimizing F LLL [f ] with respect to\n2\nf e\u2212|z| /2\u03b5 , dropping the constraint that this function should be in the LLL. As b is a constant, this lower\nbound confirms that EbTF gives at least the order of magnitude of the energy. The gap between the\nupper and the lower bound lies in the coefficient b that takes into account the density modification due\nto the presence of a large number of vortices. Filling this gap would be a first step towards a rigorous\nproof of the onset of the Abrikosov lattice in this regime.\nAlthough we have no rigorous proof that the trial state (1.32) accurately describes the true state of\naffairs, it is useful for a physical discussion to give some details on this function. The analysis of a profile\nsuch as (1.36) has already been carried out in [FJS, ABD], so we only adapt and summarize their results.\nThe critical rotation speed for the condensate to develop a central hole is\n\u0012\n\u03a9c = 1 +\n\n3k 2 bG\n8\u03c0\n\n\u00131/3\n.\n\n(1.42)\n\nFor subcritical velocities, the behavior of the condensate is not qualitatively different from that of a\nharmonically trapped condensate, so we focus on velocities \u03a9 \u2265 \u03a9c . In our scaling (see (1.11)) this is\nequivalent to the requirement \u03b2 \u2265 (3bG)1/3 (8\u03c0)\u22121/3 . Then the inner and outer radii of the condensate\nR\u00b1 are given by the relations\n1/3\n\n2\n2\nR+\n+ R\u2212\n= 4\u03b2,\n\n2\n2\nR+\n\u2212 R\u2212\n= (24bG)\n\n,\n\n(1.43)\n\nthe chemical potential is\n\u03bcTF\nb\n\n\u0012\n=\n\n3bG\n8\u03c0\n\n\u00132/3\n\n\u2212 \u03b22\n\n(1.44)\n\n\f10\n\nand the energy is\nEbTF =\n\n3\n5\n\n\u0012\n\n3bG\n8\u03c0\n\n\u00132/3\n\n\u2212 \u03b22.\n\n(1.45)\n\nIn the case of a disc-shaped condensate, the order of magnitudes of the corresponding quantities is the\nsame as above.\nThis information allows to check a posteriori the validity of our analysis. First, the LLL reduction should\nbe valid if the energy F LLL is much smaller than the spectral gap between the Lowest Landau Level and\nthe first excited level. In our scaling, this gap is \u221d \u03b5\u22121 = k \u22121/3 , and thus from (1.40) and (1.45) we\ndeduce that the reduction is valid if\nG \u001c k \u22121/2 , \u03b2 \u001c k \u22121/6 .\n\n(1.46)\n\nOne could probably show rigorously that the LLL reduction is valid under these conditions, working in\nthe spirit of [AB2]. Note that we have considered \u03b2 and G as fixed in this paper so a rigorous proof\nwould require to track the dependence on this parameters of our remainder terms. At least one condition\nwill appear for sure if one wants to use our upper bound : we have used a (elementary) homogenization\nargument which requires the number of vortices in the support of \u03c1TF\nto be large compared to 1. Given\nb\nthat the vortices lie on a lattice of period \u221d \u03b51/2 = k 1/6 and using (1.43) we arrive at the condition\nk \u001c G.\n\n(1.47)\n\nIt is interesting to remark (tracking the dependence on \u03b2 and G in the proof of Theorem 1.2) that\nunder the above condition the number of vortices for the true minimizer should be infinite. We also note\nthat, as we require both k \u001c G and G \u001c \u221a1k , necessarily k \u001c 1, which justifies our study of a small\nanharmonicity regime.\nFinally, interesting questions arise about the vortex pattern displayed by a minimizer of the energy.\nIf one believes that a minimizer is close to our trial state (1.32), then the property\n\u03a0\u03b5 (\u03b1f\u03c4 ) \u223c \u03b1f\u03c4\nthat holds true in L\u221e (amongst other topologies, see Lemma 2.1 below) indicates that the vortices\nshould lie close to the sites of an hexagonal lattice in the region of significant matter density, that is the\nsupport of \u03c1TF\nb . Very little information however can be obtained about vortices lying in the region of\nlow density.\nThese 'invisible vortices' have nevertheless a contribution : as shown in [AB1, ABD], they help create the\naverage Thomas-Fermi density profile. Indeed, if the vortex pattern was regular in the whole complex\nplane, one would obtain a Gaussian density profile. More precisely it is to be expected that the regular\nvortex lattice will be distorted close to the edge of the condensate, resulting in invisible vortices that\nwill help shape the condensate. An interesting question (see e.g. [ABD, FJS, KTU]) is then, when \u03a9 is\nabove \u03a9c and the condensate has an annular shape, what is the vortex distribution inside the hole ? In\nparticular : do vortices gather in a central multi-quantized vortex ?\nA nice feature of the LLL regime is that the condensate is completely determined by the location of\nits vortices, and one can thus minimize the energy numerically by varying the locations of the zeros of\nthe wave-function. This gives a direct access to the optimal vortex pattern and allows to spot precisely\nthe 'invisible vortices'. A direct minimization of the Gross-Pitaevskii energy would not give such an\ninformation because one should a posteriori look for density dips in a region where the density is already\nvery small.\nWe have adapted the numerical method of [ABD] to the present setting and focused on the case where\nthe condensate is annular. We refer to Section 3 for details. In particular we find invisible vortices both\n\n\f11\n\noutside the outer edge of the condensate and in the central hole of low density, with multiply quantized\nvortices appearing at the center of the trap. We also find a good agreement between the optimal value\nof the energy numerically computed and the upper bound (1.40), thus giving another argument for the\noptimality of our construction.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows : in Section 2 we prove our analytical results, the proof\nof each theorem occupying a subsection. In Section 3 we describe our numerical method and present our\nresults.\n\n2\n\nProofs\n\n2.1\n\nThe Minimization Problem\n\nWe prove Theorem 1.1. In this subsection, all parameters are considered as fixed.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. We first note (see (1.41)) that the energy functional F LLL is indeed bounded below\nin the minimization domain we have chosen (1.22).\nOur energy is defined only for f \u2208 F2\u03b5 , so we take the convention that F LLL [f ] = +\u221e if f \u2208\n/ F\u03b52 . Let\n2\n(fn )n\u2208N be a minimizing sequence for (1.22) and un = fn e\u2212|z| /\u03b5 . We note that\nZ\n\n|z|2 |un |2 \u2264\n\nC\n\n\u0012Z\n\n|un |2\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012Z\n\nC\n\n|z|4 |un |2\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u0012Z\n=\n\nC\n\n|z|4 |un |2\n\n\u00131/2\n\nC\n\nbecause of the mass constraint.

This implies that (fn )n is\nbounded in F2\u03b5 . In [ABN2] it is proved by using the Bargmann transform that F1\u03b5 is compactly embedded\nin F\u03b5 . Similarly F2\u03b5 is compactly embedded 1 in F1\u03b5 . We thus have (possibly after extraction of a\nsubsequence) the convergence of fn to some limit analytic function f , strongly in F1\u03b5 , strongly in F\u03b5 and\nweakly in F2\u03b5 .

To get (1.25) we use an integration by parts to show that M\u03b5 f = \u03a0\u03b5 (|z|2 f ). Then\nM\u03b52 f = \u03a0\u03b5 (|z|2 \u03a0\u03b5 (|z|2 f )) and we get the result.\n\n2.2\n\nInfinite Number of Zeros\n\nWe now prove that any minimizer of (1.22) has an infinite number of zeros. The argument is by contradiction and in two steps, using the two equivalent forms of the Euler-Lagrange equation (1.23) and\n(1.26).\nProof of Theorem 1.2.\nStep 1. Suppose f has a finite number of zeros. Then one may write f (z) = P (z)e\u03c6(z) where P is\nR\n2\na polynomial and \u03c6 is a holomorphic function. Now f \u2208 F\u03b5 and the condition C |f |2 e\u2212|z| /\u03b5 dz < \u221e\nimplies that Re(\u03c6(z)) \u2264 |z|2 /(2\u03b5). It is well-known (see [Boa] for example) that a holomorphic function\ncan satisfy this condition only if it is a polynomial of degree less than 2. Therefore we know that\nf (z) = P (z)e\u03b11 z+\u03b12 z\n\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nand the integrability condition on f implies \u03b12 \u2264 1/(2\u03b5). Injecting (2.3) in (1.23) and comparing the\nexponential growth of the different terms of (1.23) as in [ABN2] yields \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 0. So, if f has a finite\nnumber of zeros, it is a polynomial.\nStep 2. Now, suppose f is a polynomial of degree n\nf (z) =\n\nn\nX\nk=0\n\nak z k\n\n\f13\n\nand inject this in (1.26). The term\n\u2212\u03b2M\u03b5 f +\n\n\u0001\n1\nM\u03b52 f + \u03b5M\u03b5 f\n4\n\nis a polynomial of degree n, by the very definition (1.24) of M\u03b5 . Therefore (1.26) implies that the term\nn\n\nX\nG \u0304\nf (\u03b5\u2202z )[f 2 (z/2)] =\n(\u03b5\u2202z )k [f 2 (z/2)]\n2\nk=0\n\nis also of degree n. But (\u03b5\u2202z )k [f 2 (z/2)] is of degree 2n \u2212 k, so that it must be that ak = 0 for any k < n.\nThen f is of the form\nf (z) = an z n ,\nwith\n\n\u0001\u22121\n|an |2 = \u03c0\u03b5n+1 n!\n\nbecause of the normalization of f in F\u03b5 .

We write\n2\n\n\u03c6(z) = P (z)e\u2212\u03a9|z|\n\n/2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwith P a holomorphic function. Since polynomials are dense in F\u03b5 , it is reasonable to fix an integer n\nand to restrict the analysis to functions \u03c6 where P is a polynomial of degree less than n (see [ABN2,\nSection 6] for mathematical results on the validity of this approximation). We write our trial functions\nas in [ABD]:\nn\nY\n2\n\u03c6(z) = A\n(z \u2212 zj )e\u2212\u03a9|z| /2 ,\n(3.2)\nj=1\n\nwhere\n\n\u22121/2\n\nA = k\u03c6kL2\n\nis the normalization factor. We will numerically vary the locations zj of the vortices. An alternative\nmethod (used for example in [CKR] for a harmonically trapped condensate) would be to take\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nn\nX\n2\n\u03c6(z) = A \uf8ed\nbj z j \uf8f8 e\u2212\u03a9|z| /2\nj=0\n\nand vary the coefficients bj . The interest of our approach is to give a direct access to the exact repartition\nof vortices, whereas the alternative method would require to compute the roots of a polynomial of degree\nn, which is a delicate task for large n. In particular, varying the coefficients could probably not give the\nprecise locations of invisible vortices located in regions of low matter density. Note also that there exist\nsome good methods to directly minimize the GP energy (see [DH, DK] for recent developments), but\n\n\f17\n\nthey probably could not give access to the locations of invisible vortices neither. Indeed, one would have\nto spot zeros or phase singularities in a region where the density is very small.\nThe point here is that these vortices, although invisible, have a crucial influence on both the energy and\nthe density profile of the condensate. One can be skeptical about the existence of density dips in a region\nwhere there is so to say no matter at all. But a vortex is also carrying a phase circulation (or superfluid\ncurrent) and thus one can interpret the presence of invisible vortices as the existence of currents in the\ncondensate that are equivalent to those generated by vortices in the low density region. Taking invisible\nvortex into account with a trial function of the form (3.2) is thus a way to evaluate more precisely the\neffect of superfluid currents in the condensate.\nWe used a conjugate gradient method with a Goldstein and Price line-search. All the functions whose\nintegrals have to be computed are of the form Polynomial \u00d7 Gaussian. We thus used the Gauss-Hermite\nmethod, and we took enough Gauss points for the computations to be exact. This results in quite\nexpensive calculations, but we have been able to numerically construct condensates with up to \u223c 120\nvortices.\n\n3.2\n\nResults\n\nFigure 1: Vortex structure and atomic density for G = 3, k = 10\u22124 , \u03b2 = 1 (\u03a9 \u2212 1 = 2.2 10\u22123 ). There are\n67 vortices in total, the central vortex is constituted of 11 single vortices.\nWe show in Fig.1 and Fig.2 typical examples of configurations we numerically computed. The\nqualitative features of the vortex patterns and atomic densities confirm our theoretical results and are\nin good agreement with existing theoretical and numerical studies [FJS, KB]. Note however that the\nnumerics become quite intricate for large number of vortices, which accounts for the relative lack of\nsymmetry of Fig.2.\nAs was expected, the condensate develops a central hole and visible vortices are regularly distributed\nand densely packed in the annular region of significant atomic density. The hexagonal lattice is not\nclearly observed however, which seems to be due to the competition between the annular geometry of\nthe condensate and the repulsion between vortices. The former tends to force vortices to form concentric\ncircles while the latter favors the hexagonal lattice. This effect is apparent in several other simulations\nof rotating annular BECs, see [AM, FJS] for 2D simulations and [AD, Dan] for 3D ones. To observe\nclearly the hexagonal lattice one would need the annulus to be thicker so that it could contain more\nvortices. This would make the numerics all the more challenging.\nOur computations also show a distortion of the vortex pattern near the external radius of the\ncondensate, resulting in invisible vortices in the exterior region of low atomic density as is the case for\n\n\f18\n\nFigure 2: Vortex structure and atomic density for G = 3, k = 10\u22125 , \u03b2 = 1 (\u03a9 \u2212 1 = 4.6 10\u22124 ). There are\n119 vortices in total, the central vortex is constituted of 20 single vortices.\n\nFigure 3: Two example of vortex configurations for G = 3, k = 10\u22124 , \u03b2 = 1(\u03a9\u22121 = 2.2 10\u22123 ), respectively\nwith n = 60 and n = 67 vortices.\nharmonically trapped condensates [ABD]. Some vortices also lie in the central hole as theoretically\npredicted and we can get information on their precise locations: we observe a distortion of the regular\nlattice near the inner radius of the condensate, resulting in isolated singly-quantized vortices encircling\na central multiply quantized vortex. We computed configurations for which this central vortex has up\nto 20 units of circulation while there is a total of 32 units of circulation in the entire hole and 83 visible\nvortices. The number of vortices (both visible and invisible) increases with increasing \u03a9 or \u03b2, but since\nour scaling does not allow to explore a large domain of \u03a9 when G is fixed, we mainly varied k. The total\nvorticity of the system increases with decreasing k.\nAll vortices do not have the same contribution to the energy: as n increases, the vortex pattern\nin the annular region of significant atomic density remains the same up to possible rotations, with the\nadditional vortices first gathering in the central vortex, then constituting the distorted lattice near the\ninner boundary of the condensate and finally occupying the distorted sites beyond the external radius.\nWith increasing n (see Fig.4), the energy reaches a first plateau when the central figure is formed,\nconstituted of the visible vortices and the vortices in the central hole. A second plateau is reached\nwhen enough distorted sites beyond the external radius are occupied. For example, for the parameters\ncorresponding to Fig.1 and Fig.4 (k = 10\u22124 , G = 3, \u03b2 = 1), the energy varies by \u223c \u00b110\u22126 in relative value\nwhen n is increased from 60 to 67 (Fig.3) and the atomic density does not vary significantly. We find a\n\n\f19\n\ngood agreement between our numerical results and the upper bound to the energy computed in Theorem\n1.3. The energy of our analytical trial function typically differs by \u223c 10\u22123 to \u223c 10\u22122 in relative value from\nthe energy numerically computed. The agreement between the radii theoretically predicted (1.43) and\nextracted from the numerical simulations is typically a little worse but still satisfactory (relative errors\nranging from 10\u22122 to 10\u22121 ). Again, obtaining a better agreement would probably require to consider a\nthicker annulus containing more vortices. This would result in more difficult simulations.\n\nFigure 4: Minimum energy as a function of the number of vortices in the trial wave function (G = 3, k =\n10\u22124 , \u03b2 = 1).\n\nReferences\n[ARV] J.R.
