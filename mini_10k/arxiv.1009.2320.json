On the base of the LEP2\nexperiments the low bounds on parameters of various models extending the\nSM have been estimated and the scale of new physics was obtained [1, 2, 3,\n4, 5]. Although no new particles were discovered, a general believe is that the\nenergy scale of new physics to be of order 1 TeV, that may serve as a guide for\nexperiments at the Tevatron and LHC. In this situation, any information about\nnew heavy particles obtained on the base of the present day data is desirable\nand important.\nNumerous extended models include the Z \u2032 gauge boson \u2013 massive neutral\nvector particle associated with the extra U (1) subgroup of an underlying group.\nSearching for this particle as a virtual state is widely discussed in the literature\n(see Ref. [6, 7] for review). In the content of searching for Z \u2032 at the LHC and the\n\u2217 gulov@dsu.dp.ua\n\u2020 skalozubv@daad-alumni.de\n\n1\n\n\fILC an essential information and prospects for future investigations are given\nin lectures [8]. Such aspects as the mass of Z \u2032 , couplings to the SM particles,\nZ\u2013Z \u2032 mixing and its influence in various processes and particles parameters,\ndistinctions between different models are discussed in details. We shall turn\nto these papers in what follows. As concerned a searching for Z \u2032 in the LEP\nexperiments and the experiments at Tevatron [9], it was carried out mainly in\na model-dependent way. Some popular models has been investigated and low\nbounds on the mass mZ \u2032 were estimated (see Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the recent\nresults in Refs. [10, 11]). As it is occurred, the low masses are varying in a wide\nenergy interval 400-1800 GeV dependently on a specific model. These bounds\nare a little bit different in the LEP and Tevatron experiments. In this situation\na model-independent analysis is of interest.\nIn the papers [12, 13, 15, 16] of the present authors a new approach for\nthe model-independent search for Z \u2032 -boson was proposed. In contrast to other\nmodel-independent searches, it gives a possibility to pick out uniquely Z \u2032 virtual\nstate proper for a wide class of models (listed below) beyond the SM. Our consideration is based on two constituents: 1) The relations between Z \u2032 couplings\nmotivated by renormalizability of an unknown theory beyond the SM. Due to\nthese relations, a number of unknown Z \u2032 parameters entering the amplitudes\nof different scattering processes considerably decreases. 2) When these relations are accounted for, some kinematics properties of the amplitude become\nuniquely correlated with this virtual state and the Z \u2032 signals exhibit themselves.\nThe corresponding observables have also been introduced and applied to analyze the LEP2 experiment data. Comparing the mean values of the observables\nwith the necessary specific values, one could arrive at a conclusion about the\nZ \u2032 existence. The confidence level (CL) of these values has been estimated and\nadduced in addition. Without taking into consideration the relations between\ncoupling the determination of Z \u2032 -boson requires a supplementary specification\ndue to a larger number of different couplings contributing to the observables.\nIn Refs. [12, 15, 16] the one-parametric observables were introduced and\nthe signals (hints in fact) of the Z \u2032 have been determined at the 1\u03c3 CL in the\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 process, and at the 2\u03c3 CL in the Bhabha process. The Z \u2032 mass\nwas estimated to be 1\u20131.2 TeV. An increase in statistics could make these signals\nmore pronounced. In Ref. [17] the updated results of the one-parameter fit and\nthe complete many-parametric fit of the LEP2 data were performed with the\ngoal to estimate a possible signal of the Z \u2032 -boson with accounting for the final\ndata of the LEP collaborations DELPHI and OPAL [2, 3, 4, 5]. Usually, in a\nmany-parametric fit the uncertainty of the result increases drastically because of\nextra parameters. On the contrary, in our approach due to the relations between\nZ \u2032 couplings there are only 2-3 independent parameters for the investigated\nleptonic scattering processes. As it was showed in Ref. [17], an inevitable\nincrease of confidence areas in the many-parametric space was compensated\ndue to accounting for all accessible experimental information. Therefore, the\nuncertainty of the many-parametric fit was estimated as the comparable with\nprevious one-parametric fits in Refs. [15, 16]. In this approach the combined\ndata fit for all lepton processes is also possible. Note that the hints for the Z \u2032\n2\n\n\fhave been determined in all the processes considered that increases the reliability\nof the signal. These results may serve as a good input into the LHC and future\nILC experiments and used in various aspects. To underline the importance of\nthem we mention that there are many tools at the LHC for the identification\nof Z \u2032 . But many of them are only applicable if Z \u2032 is relatively light. The\nknowledge of the Z \u2032 couplings to SM fermions also have important consequences.\nAs concerns the notion \"model-independent search\" used below, it refers to a\nclass of models containing Z \u2032 and inspired by the grand-unified field theories. It\ndoes not mean all possible ones. But if one determines the signal of this state,\nfurther specification of the underlying theory could follow.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In sect. 2 we give a necessary information\nabout the description of Z \u2032 at low energies and introduce the relations between\nthe Z \u2032 couplings. In sect. 3 the cross sections and the observables to pick out\nuniquely the virtual Z \u2032 in the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 processes are given. The\nfits of data are described and discussed. Then in sect. 4 the same is present for\nthe Bhabha process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 . The one parametric and two parametric fits\nare discussed. In sect. 5 we discuss the role of the present model-independent\nanalysis for the LHC experiments. The discussion and comparison with results\nof other approaches are given in sect. 6.\n\n2\n\nThe Abelian Z \u2032 boson at low energies\n\nLet us adduce a necessary information about the Abelian Z \u2032 -boson. This particle\nis predicted by a number of grand unification models. Among them the E6 and\nSO(10) based models [18] (for instance, LR, \u03c7\u2212\u03c8 and so on) are often discussed\nin the literature. In all the models, the Abelian Z \u2032 -boson is described by a lowenergy \u0168 (1) gauge subgroup originated in some symmetry breaking pattern.\nAt low energies, the Z \u2032 -boson can manifest itself by means of the couplings\nto the SM fermions and scalars as a virtual intermediate state. Moreover, the Zboson couplings are also modified due to a Z\u2013Z \u2032 mixing. In principle, arbitrary\neffective Z \u2032 interactions to the SM fields could be considered at low energies.\nHowever, the couplings of non-renormalizable types have to be suppressed by\nheavy mass scales because of decoupling. Therefore, significant signals beyond\nthe SM can be inspired by the couplings of renormalizable types. Such couplings can be derived by adding new \u0168 (1)-terms to the electroweak covariant\nderivatives Dew in the Lagrangian [19, 20] (review, Ref. [6, 7])\n\u0013 2\n\u0012\nig \u2032\nig\u0303\nig\na\n(1)\nB\u03bc Y\u03c6 \u2212 B\u0303\u03bc \u1ef8\u03c6 \u03c6 ,\nL\u03c6 = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 \u03c3a W\u03bc \u2212\n2\n2\n2\n\nLf\n\n=\n+\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nig\nig\u0303\nig \u2032\nf \u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 \u03c3a W\u03bca \u2212\nB\u03bc YfL \u2212 B\u0303\u03bc \u1ef8fL fL\n2\n2\n2\nfL\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX\nig\u0303\ni\nf \u0304R \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 ig \u2032 B\u03bc Qf \u2212 B\u0303\u03bc \u1ef8fR fR ,\n2\ni\n\nX\n\nfR\n\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere summation over all the SM left-handed fermion doublets, leptons and\nquarks, fL = (fu )L , (fd )L , and the right-handed singlets, fR = (fu )R , (fd )R ,\nis understood.

The Z\u2013Z \u2032 mixing angle \u03b80 is\ndetermined by the coupling \u1ef8\u03c6 as follows\n\u0012 4 \u0013\ng\u0303 sin \u03b8W cos \u03b8W m2Z\nmZ\n\u221a\n\u03b80 =\n,\n(3)\n\u1ef8\u03c6 + O\nm2Z \u2032\nm4Z \u2032\n4\u03c0\u03b1em\nwhere \u03b8W is the SM Weinberg angle, and \u03b1em is the electromagnetic fine structure constant. Although the mixing angle is a small quantity of order m\u22122\nZ \u2032 , it\ncontributes to the Z-boson exchange amplitude and cannot be neglected at the\nLEP energies.\nIn what follows we will also use the Z \u2032 couplings to the vector and axialvector fermion currents defined as\nvf = g\u0303\n\n\u1ef8L,f + \u1ef8R,f\n,\n2\n\naf = g\u0303\n\n\u1ef8R,f \u2212 \u1ef8L,f\n.\n2\n\n(4)\n\nThe Lagrangian (2) leads to the following interactions between the fermions and\nthe Z and Z \u2032 mass eigenstates:\nLZ f \u0304f\n\n=\n\nLZ \u2032 f \u0304f\n\n=\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n5 SM\n5\nZ\u03bc f \u0304\u03b3 \u03bc (vfSM\nZ + \u03b3 af Z ) cos \u03b80 + (vf + \u03b3 af ) sin \u03b80 f,\n2\n\u0003\n1 \u2032  \u0304 \u03bc\u0002\n5 SM\nZ\u03bc f \u03b3 (vf + \u03b3 5 af ) cos \u03b80 \u2212 (vfSM\nZ + \u03b3 af Z ) sin \u03b80 f,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nSM\nwhere f is an arbitrary SM fermion state; vfSM\nZ , af Z are the SM couplings of\nthe Z-boson.\nAt low energies the Z \u2032 couplings enter the cross-section together with the\ninverse Z \u2032 mass, so it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless couplings\n\n\u0101f = \u221a\n\nmZ\nv\u0304f = \u221a\nvf ,\n4\u03c0mZ \u2032\n\nmZ\naf ,\n4\u03c0mZ \u2032\n\n(6)\n\nwhich can be constrained by experiments.\nThe low energy parameters \u1ef8\u03c6 , \u1ef8L,f , \u1ef8R,f must be fitted in experiments. In\nmost investigations they were considered as independent ones. In a particular\nmodel, the couplings \u1ef8\u03c6 , \u1ef8L,f , \u1ef8R,f take some specific values. In case when\nthe model is unknown, these parameters remain potentially arbitrary numbers.\nHowever, this is not the case if one assumes that the underlying extended model\nis a renormalizable one.\n4\n\n\fIn Refs. [12, 13] it was shown that these parameters are correlated. This correlations follows if the underlying unknown theory is a renormalizable one. The\nfollowing conditions were assumed to derive the relations between Z \u2032 couplings:\n1. only one neutral vector boson exists at energy scale about 1-10 TeV,\n2. the Z \u2032 boson can be phenomenologically described by the effective Lagrangian (2), (1) at low energies,\n3. the Z \u2032 boson and other possible heavy particles are decoupled at considered energies, and the theory beyond the Z \u2032 decoupling scale is either oneor two-Higgs-doublet standard model,\n4. the SM gauge group is a subgroup of possible extended gauge group of the\nunderlying theory. So, the only origin of possible tree-level Z \u2032 interactions\nto the SM vector bosons is the Z\u2013Z \u2032 mixing.\nUnder these conditions, we have obtained the relations between phenomenological parameters of the effective Lagrangian (2), (1):\n\u1ef8\u03c6,1 = \u1ef8\u03c6,2 \u2261 \u1ef8\u03c6 ,\n\n\u1ef8L,f = \u1ef8L,f \u2217 ,\n\n\u1ef8R,f = \u1ef8L,f + 2T3f \u1ef8\u03c6 .\n\n(7)\n\nHere f and f \u2217 are the partners of the SU (2)L fermion doublet (l\u2217 = \u03bdl , \u03bd \u2217 =\nl, qu\u2217 = qd and qd\u2217 = qu ), T3f is the third component of weak isospin. They are\nkey point for investigations reported below.\nIntroducing the Z \u2032 couplings to the vector and axial-vector fermion currents\n(4), the last formula in Eq. (7) yields\nvf \u2212 af = vf \u2217 \u2212 af \u2217 ,\n\naf = T3f g\u0303 \u1ef8\u03c6 .\n\n(8)\n\nThe couplings of the Abelian Z \u2032 to the axial-vector fermion current have a\nuniversal absolute value proportional to the Z \u2032 coupling to the scalar doublet.\nThen, the Z\u2013Z \u2032 mixing angle (3) can be determined by the axial-vector coupling.\nAs a result, the number of independent couplings is significantly reduced.\nWe assume no new light particles. The relations could change essentially if\nthe SM has to be modified at energies below the Z \u2032 mass.\nThe derived relations are necessary but not exhaustive constraints on the\nZ \u2032 couplings. To derive exhaustive constraints one need to fix the complete\nparticle content at high energies in order to ensure the cancelation of ultraviolet\ndivergencies in arbitrary scattering process.\nThe relations (8) were derived for effective low-energy parameters accounting\nfor radiation corections. Nevertheless, they also hold at tree-level in a wide class\nof known models containing the Abelian Z \u2032 . In this case, it is possible to derive\nthem by imposing the requirement that the SM Lagrangian (including Yukawa\nterm) has to be invariant with respect to the extra \u0168 (1) group associated with\nthe Z \u2032 [14].\nA lot widely discussed models are derived from the E6 group (the so called\nLR, \u03c7-\u03c8 models). The tree-level Z \u2032 couplings to the SM fermions in the models\nare shown in Table 1.\n5\n\n\fThe E6 -symmetry breaking scheme\nE6 \u2192 SO(10) \u00d7 U(1)\u03c8 ,\n\nSO(10) \u2192 SU(3)c \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L .\n\nleads to the so called left-right (LR) model. Another scheme,\nE6 \u2192 SO(10) \u00d7 U(1)\u03c8 \u2192 SU(5) \u00d7 U(1)\u03c7 \u00d7 U(1)\u03c8 ,\npredicts the Abelian Z \u2032 which is a linear combination of the neutral vector\nbosons \u03c8 and \u03c7,\nZ \u2032 = \u03c7 cos \u03b2 + \u03c8 sin \u03b2\nwith the mixing angle \u03b2. If we suppose only one Z \u2032 boson at low energies, the\n\u03c8 boson should be much heavier than the \u03c7 field. In this case the field \u03c8 is\ndecoupled and \u03b2 \u2192 0. As it is seen, both the LR and the \u03c7-\u03c8 models (with\n\u03b2 = 0 to avoid two Z \u2032 bosons with the same scale of masses) satisfy the relations\n(7) except for neutrinos. This fact is a consequence of the zero neutrino mass\nassumed already. Neutrinos are not detected in the discussed experiments, so\nthe question about Z \u2032 interactions to neutrinos is inessential.\nThe relations (7) are valid not only for the E6 based models in Table 1. For\nexample, the relations also cover the Sequential SM (SSM) mentioned in reports\nof LEP Collaborations. Thus, they describe correlations between Z \u2032 couplings\nfor a wide set of models beyond the SM. That is the reason to call the relations\nmodel-independent ones.\nLEP collaborations have applied model dependent search for Z \u2032 and obtained\nthe low bounds on the mass mZ \u2032 \u2265 400 \u2212 800 GeV dependently on a specific\nmodel [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In our analysis, the relations (7) give a possibility to reduce\nthe number of fitted parameters, to determine kinematics of the processes, and\nto introduce observables which uniquely pick out the Z \u2032 signals. Therefore we\nare able to distinguish the particle instead of constraining its mass.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nZ \u2032 search in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 processes\nThe differential cross section\n\nLet us consider the processes e+ e\u2212 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 (l = \u03bc, \u03c4 ) with the non-polarized\ninitial and final state fermions. In order to introduce the observable which\nselects the signal of the Abelian Z \u2032 boson we need to compute the differential\ncross-sections of the processes up to the one-loop level. Two classes of Feynman\ndiagrams are taken into account. The first one includes the pure SM graphs. The\nset of SM diagrams give the SM prediction for the process which is a background\nfor observation of possible deviations due to Z \u2032 boson. Obviously, the SM has\nto be estimated as accurate as possible. So, the full set of radiative corrections\nmust be taken into account. They are the mass operators, the vertex corrections,\nthe boxes, and the effects of initial and final state radiation of soft photons. The\nkinematic region allowed by the detectors is also important. Fine cancelations\nof ultraviolet and infrared divergencies occur due to renormalizability of the SM\n6\n\n\fgiving the finite result. The resulting SM value is published by the Collaboration\nand have been checked.\nThe second class of diagrams includes heavy Z \u2032 boson as a virtual state.\nSuch graphs lead to small corrections of order s/m2Z \u2032 to cross section. Since\nthe effective low energy Lagrangian is used to describe Z \u2032 interactions to SM\nparticles and the particle content of the underlying theory remains hidden, one\nhas to consider the Z \u2032 contribution in the decoupling limit. Namely, we assume\nthat Z \u2032 is not excited inside loops. The tree-level diagram e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2032 \u2192\nl+ l\u2212 defines a leading contribution to the cross-section. It is enough to take\ninto account this diagram to estimate possible Z \u2032 signals. The cross-section\nincludes the interference of the Z \u2032 -exchange amplitude with the SM amplitudes.\nRadiative corrections were incorporated with the Z \u2032 -exchange diagram in the\nimproved Born approximation.\nIn actual calculations and experimental data treating, the SM values of cross\nsections coincide with the results of the LEP Collaborations and the deviations\ndue to the Z \u2032 boson have been computed in the improved Born approximation\nat one-loop level. The same approach is used for the Bhabha process which\nwill be analyzed in next section. This is sufficient to analyze the present day\nexperimental data.\n\u2032\nIn the lower order in m\u22122\nZ \u2032 the Z contributions to the differential cross-section\n+ \u2212\n+ \u2212\nof the process e e \u2192 l l are expressed in terms of four-fermion contact couplings, only. If one takes into consideration the higher-order corrections in m\u22122\nZ\u2032 ,\nit becomes possible to estimate separately the Z \u2032 -induced contact couplings and\nthe Z \u2032 mass [21]. In the present analysis we keep the terms of order O(m\u22124\nZ \u2032 ) to\nfit both of these parameters.\nExpanding the differential cross-section in the inverse Z \u2032 mass and neglecting\nthe terms of order O(m\u22126\nZ \u2032 ), we have\nd\u03c3l (s)\ndz\n\n7\n\n=\n\ni\n\n\u0003\nd\u03c3lSM (s) X X \u0002 l\nl\nAij (s, z) + Bij\n(s, z)\u03b6 xi xj\n+\ndz\ni=1 j=1\n+\n\nj X\nk\n7 X\ni X\nX\n\nl\nCijkn\n(s, z)xi xj xk xn ,\n\n(9)\n\ni=1 j=1 k=1 n=1\n\nwhere the dimensionless quantities\n\u03b6=\n\nm2Z\n,\nm2Z \u2032\n\n(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , x6 , x7 ) = (\u0101, v\u0304e , v\u0304\u03bc , v\u0304\u03c4 , v\u0304d , v\u0304s , v\u0304b )\n\n(10)\n\nare introduced. Since the axial-vector couplings of the Abelian Z \u2032 boson are\nuniversal, we use the shorthand notation \u0101 = \u0101e . In what follows the index\nl = \u03bc, \u03c4 denotes the final-state lepton.\nThe coefficients A, B, C are determined by the SM couplings and masses.\nEach factor may include the tree-level contribution, the one-loop correction\nand the term describing the soft-photon emission. The factors A describe the\nleading-order contribution, whereas others correspond to the higher order corrections in m\u22122\nZ\u2032 .\n7\n\n\f3.2\n\nThe observable\n\nTo take into consideration the correlations (3) we introduce the observable \u03c3l (z)\ndefined as the difference of cross sections integrated in some ranges of the scattering angle \u03b8 [13, 15]:\n\u03c3l (z) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nz\n\n1\n\nd\u03c3l\nd cos \u03b8 \u2212\nd cos \u03b8\n\nZ\n\nz\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u03c3l\nd cos \u03b8,\nd cos \u03b8\n\n(11)\n\nwhere z stands for the cosine of the boundary angle. The idea of introducing the\nz-dependent observable (11) is to choose the value of the kinematic parameter\nz in such a way that to pick up the characteristic features of the Abelian Z \u2032\nsignals.\nThe deviation of the observable from its SM value can be derived by the\nangular integration of the differential cross-section and has the form:\n\u2206\u03c3l (z) = \u03c3l (z) \u2212 \u03c3lSM (z) =\n+\n\nj X\nk\n7 X\ni X\nX\n\n7 X\ni h\ni\nX\nl\n\u00c3lij (s, z) + B\u0303ij\n(s, z)\u03b6 xi xj\ni=1 j=1\n\nl\n(s, z)xi xj xk xn .\nC\u0303ijkn\n\n(12)\n\ni=1 j=1 k=1 n=1\n\nThen let us introduce the quantity \u2206\u03c3 (z) \u2261 \u03c3 (z) \u2212 \u03c3SM (z) which owing to\nthe relations (7) can be written in the form\n\u2206\u03c3f (z) =\n\n2 h\n\u03b1Nf gZ\n\u2032\nF0f (z, s)\u1ef8\u03c62 + 2F1f (z, s)T3f \u1ef8L,f \u1ef8L,e\n8 m2Z \u2032\ni\n+ 2F2f (z, s)T3f \u1ef8L,f \u1ef8\u03c6 + F3f (z, s)\u1ef8L,e \u1ef8\u03c6 .\n\n(13)\n\nThe factor functions Fif (z, s) depend on the fermion type\n\u221a through the |Qf |,\nonly.

(14) one can see that the leading contributions to the leptonic\nfactors F1l , F2l , F3l are found to be proportional to the same polynomial in z.\nThis is the characteristic feature of the leptonic functions Fil originating due\nto the kinematic properties of fermionic currents and the specific values of the\nSM leptonic charges. Therefore, it is possible to choose the value of z = z \u2217\nwhich switches off three leptonic factors F1l , F2l , F3l simultaneously. Moreover,\nthe quark function F3q in the lower order is proportional to the leptonic one and\ntherefore is switched off, too. As is seen from Fig. 1, the appropriate value of\nz \u2217 is about \u223c 0.3. By choosing this value of z \u2217 one can simplify Eq. (13). It\nis also follows from Eq. (13) that neglecting the factors F1l , F2l , F3l one obtains\nthe sign definite quantity \u2206\u03c3l (z \u2217 ) \u223c \u1ef8\u03c62 \u223c \u01012 .\nl\nThere is the interval of boundary angle values at which the factors \u00c3l11 , B\u030311\n,\nl\n2\n2\n4\nand C\u03031111 at the sign-definite parameters \u0101 , \u0101 \u03b6, and \u0101 contribute more than\n95% of the observable value. It gives a possibility to construct the sign-definite\nobservable \u2206\u03c3l (z \u2217 ) < 0 by specifying the proper value of z \u2217 .\nIn general, one could choose the boundary angle z \u2217 in different schemes. If\njust a few number of tree-level four-fermion contact couplings are considered,\none can specify z \u2217 in order to cancel the factor at the vector-vector coupling.\nHowever, if one-loop corrections are taken into account there is a large amount of\nadditional contact couplings. So, we have to define some quantitative criterion\nF (z) to estimate the contributions from sign-definite factors at a given value of\nthe boundary angle z. Maximizing the criterion, one could derive the value z \u2217\ncorresponding to the sign-definite observable \u2206\u03c3l (z \u2217 ). Since the observable is\nlinear in the coefficients A, B, and C, we introduce the following criterion,\nF = P\n\nall \u00c3\n\n|\u00c311 | + \u03c9B |B\u030311 | + \u03c9C |C\u03031111 |\n,\nP\nP\n\u00c3ij + \u03c9B\nB\u0303ij + \u03c9C\nC\u0303ijkn\nall B\u0303\n\n(15)\n\nall C\u0303\n\nwhere the positive 'weights' \u03c9B \u223c \u03b6 and \u03c9C \u223c \u01eb take into account the order of\neach term in the inverse Z \u2032 mass.\nThe numeric values of the 'weights' \u03c9B and \u03c9C can be taken from the present\nday bounds on the contact couplings [1]. As the computation shows, the value\nof z \u2217 with the accuracy 10\u22123 depends on the order of the 'weight' magnitudes,\nonly. So, in what follows we take \u03c9B \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 and \u03c9C \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nThe function z \u2217 (s) is the decreasing function of the center-of-mass energy.\nIt is tabulated for the LEP2 energies in Table 2. The corresponding values of\nthe maximized function F are within the interval 0.95 < F < 0.96.\nl\nl\nSince \u00c3l11 (s, z \u2217 ) < 0, B\u030311\n(s, z \u2217 ) < 0 and C\u03031111\n(s, z \u2217 ) < 0, the observable\nh\ni\nl\nl\n\u2206\u03c3l (z \u2217 ) = \u00c3l11 (s, z \u2217 ) + \u03b6 B\u030311\n(s, z \u2217 ) \u01012 + C\u03031111\n(s, z \u2217 )\u01014\n(16)\nis negative with the accuracy 4\u20135%. Since this property follows from the relations (8) for the Abelian Z \u2032 boson, the observable \u2206\u03c3l (z \u2217 ) selects the modelindependent signal of this particle in the processes e+ e\u2212 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 . It allows to\nuse the data on scattering into \u03bc\u03bc and \u03c4 \u03c4 pairs in order to estimate the Abelian\nZ \u2032 coupling to the axial-vector lepton currents.\n10\n\n\fAlthough the observable can be computed from the differential cross-sections\ndirectly, it is also possible to recalculate it from the total cross-sections and the\nforward-backward asymmetries. The recalculation procedure has the proper\ntheoretical accuracy. Nevertheless, it allows to reduce the experimental errors\non the observable, since the published data on the total cross-sections and the\nforward-backward asymmetries are more precise than the data on the differential\ncross-sections.\nThe recalculation is based on the fact that the differential cross-section can\nbe approximated with a good accuracy by the two-parametric polynomial in the\ncosine of the scattering angle z:\nd\u03c3l (s)\nd\u03c3 SM (s)\n= l\n+ (1 + z 2 )\u03b2l + z\u03b7l + \u03b4l (z),\ndz\ndz\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03b4l (z) measures the difference between the exact and the approximated\ncross-sections. The approximated cross-section reproduces the exact one in the\nlimit of the massless initial- and final-state leptons and if one neglects the contributions of the box diagrams. Detailed analysis of this point is given in [15]\nwhere it was showed that the the theoretical error is one order less than the\ncorresponding statistical uncertainty for the observable. Thus, the proposed\napproximation is quite good and can be successfully used to obtain more accurate experimental values of the observable.\n\n3.3\n\nData fit\n\nTo search for the model-independent signals of the Abelian Z \u2032 -boson we will\nanalyze the introduced observable \u2206\u03c3l (z \u2217 ) (16) on the base of the LEP2 data\nset. In the lower order in m\u22122\nZ \u2032 it depends on one flavor-independent parameter\n\u01012 ,\nl\n(s, z \u2217 )\u01014 ,\n(18)\n\u2206\u03c3lth (z \u2217 ) = \u00c3l11 (s, z \u2217 )\u01012 + C\u03031111\nwhich can be fitted from the experimental values of \u2206\u03c3\u03bc (z \u2217 ) and \u2206\u03c3\u03c4 (z \u2217 ). As\nwe axplained above, the sign of the fitted parameter (\u01012 > 0) is the characteristic\nfeature of the Abelian Z \u2032 signal.\nIn what follows we will apply the usual fit method based on the likelihood\nfunction. The central value of \u01012 is obtained by the minimization of the \u03c72 function:\n\u0002 ex \u2217\n\u00032\nX \u2206\u03c3\u03bc,n\n(z ) \u2212 \u2206\u03c3\u03bcth (z \u2217 )\n2 2\n,\n(19)\n\u03c7 (\u0101 ) =\nex (z \u2217 )2\n\u03b4\u03c3\u03bc,n\nn\nwhere the sum runs over the experimental points entering a data set chosen.\nThe 1\u03c3 CL interval (b1 , b2 ) for the fitted parameter is derived by means of the\nlikelihood function L(\u01012 ) \u221d exp[\u2212\u03c72 (\u01012 )/2].

[1] we introduce the contact interaction scale\n\u039b2 = 4m2Z \u0101\u22122 .\n(21)\nThis normalization of contact couplings is admitted in Refs. [1]. We use again\nthe likelihood method to determine a one-sided lower limit on the scale \u039b at\nthe 95% CL. It is derived by the integration of the likelihood function over the\nphysically allowed region \u01012 > 0.

As it is reported by the DELPHI Collaboration, there is\na theoretical error of the SM values of about 2%. In our analysis this error is\nadded to the statistical and systematic ones for all the Collaborations. As it was\nchecked, the fit results are practically insensitive to accounting for this error.\nThe deviation from the SM is computed in the improved Born approximation. This approximation is sufficient for our analysis leading to the systematic\nerror of the fit results less than 5-10 per cents.\nThe deviation from the SM of the differential cross-section for the process\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 can be expressed through various quadratic combinations of couplings a = ae , ve , v\u03bc , v\u03c4 .

However, in our\nanalysis when we are interested in searching for signals of the Z \u2032 -boson on the\nbase of the effective low-energy Lagrangian (2)\u2013(1), these contributions to the\ncross-section are essential.\n\n4.2\n\nOne-parameter fit\n\nThe factor f2ee (z)\u221ais positive monotonic function of z (see Fig. 2 for the centerof-mass energies s = 200 GeV.

Now these factors are finite at z \u2192 1. Each of them in a special\nway influences the differential cross-section.\n1. The factor at v\u0304 2 is just the unity. Hence, the four-fermion contact coupling\nbetween vector currents, v\u0304 2 , determines the level of the deviation from the\nSM value.\n2. The factor at \u01012 depends on the scattering angle in a non-trivial way. It\nallows to recognize the Abelian Z \u2032 boson, if the experimental accuracy is\nsufficient.\n3. The factor at \u0101v\u0304 results in small corrections.\nThus, effectively, the obtained normalized differential cross-section is a twoparametric function. In the next sections we introduce the observables to fit\nseparately each of these parameters.\n\n4.3\n\nObservables to pick out v\u0304 2\n\nThe normalized deviation of the differential cross-section (28) is (effectively)\nthe function of two parameters, \u01012 and v\u0304 2 . We are going to introduce the\nintegrated observables which determine separately the four-fermion couplings\n\u01012 and v\u0304 2 [16].\nLet us first proceed with the observable for v\u0304 2 . After normalization the\nfactor at the vector-vector four-fermion coupling becomes the unity. Whereas\nthe factor at \u01012 is a sign-varying function of the cosine of the scattering angle.\nAs it follows from Fig. 3, for the center-of-mass energy 200 GeV it is small over\nthe backward scattering angles. So, to measure the value of v\u0304 2 the normalized\ndeviation of the differential cross-section has to be integrated over the backward\nangles. For the center-of-mass energy 500 GeV the factor at \u01012 is already a nonvanishing quantity for the backward scattering angles. The curves corresponding\nto intermediate energies are distributed in between two these curves. Since they\nare sign-varying ones at each energy point some interval of z can be chosen to\nmake the integral to be zero. Thus, to measure the Z \u2032 coupling to the electron\nvector current v\u0304 2 we introduce the integrated cross-section (28)\n\u03c3V =\n\nZ\n\nz0 +\u2206z\n\n(d\u03c3\u0303/dz)dz,\n\n(29)\n\nz0\n\nwhere at each energy the most effective interval [z0 , z0 + \u2206z] is determined by\nthe following requirements:\n1. The relative contribution of the coupling v\u0304 2 is maximal. Equivalently, the\ncontribution of the factor at \u01012 is suppressed.\n2. The length \u2206z of the interval is maximal. This condition ensures that the\nlargest number of bins is taken into consideration.\n16\n\n\f200 GeV\n\n\u2206z\n\n500 GeV\n\n\u2206z\n\n1.2\n0.8\n0.8\n\n>90%\n<90%\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n<90%\n\n0\n\n0\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\nz0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\nz0\n\nFigure 4: Relative contribution of the factor at v\u0304 2 to the observable \u03c3V as the\nfunction of the left boundary of the angle interval, z0 , and the interval length,\n\u2206z, at the center-of-mass energy 200 and 500 GeV.

In each plot the dark area corresponds\nto the observables which values are determined by the vector-vector coupling\nv\u0304 2 with the accuracy > 95%. The area reflects the correlation of the width\nof the integration interval \u2206z with the choice of the initial z0 following from\nthe mentioned requirements. Within this area we choose the observable which\nincludes the largest number of bins (largest \u2206z). The corresponding values of\nz0 and \u2206z are marked by the white dot on the plots in Fig. 4. As the carried\nout analysis showed, the point z0 is shifted to the right with increase in energy\nwhereas \u2206z remains approximately the same.\nFrom the plots it follows that the most efficient intervals are\n\u221a\ns = 200 GeV,\n\u22120.6 < z < 0.2,\n\u221a\n\u22120.3 < z < 0.7,\ns = 500 GeV.\n(31)\nTherefore the observable (29) allows to measure the Z \u2032 coupling to the electron\nvector current v\u0304 2 with the efficiency > 95%.\nFitting the LEP2 final data with the one-parameter observable, we find the\nvalues of the Z \u2032 coupling to the electron vector current together with their 1\u03c3\n\n17\n\n\funcertainties:\nALEPH : v\u0304e2 =\nDELPHI :\nL3 :\nOPAL :\nCombined :\n\nv\u0304e2\nv\u0304e2\nv\u0304e2\nv\u0304e2\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u22120.11 \u00b1 6.53 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n1.60 \u00b1 1.46 \u00d7 10\u22124\n5.42 \u00b1 3.72 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n2.42 \u00b1 1.27 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n2.24 \u00b1 0.92 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\nAs one can see, the most precise data of DELPHI and OPAL collaborations\nare resulted in the Abelian Z \u2032 hints at one and two standard deviation level,\ncorrespondingly.

Since the factor at v\u0304 2 in the d\u03c3\u0303/dz equals\nunity, this can be done by summing up equal number of bins with positive and\nnegative weights. In particular, the forward-backward normalized deviation of\nthe differential cross-section appears to be sensitive mainly to \u01012 ,\nZ zmax\nZ 0\nd\u03c3\u0303\nd\u03c3\u0303\ndz\n\u03c3\u0303FB =\ndz\nF\u0303a,FB \u01012 + F\u0303av,FB \u0101v\u0304.\n(32)\n\u2212\ndz\ndz\n0\n\u2212zmax\nThe value zmax is determined by the number of bins included and, in fact,\ndepends on the data set considered. The LEP2 experiment accepted e+ e\u2212\nevents with |z| < 0.72. In what follows we take the angular cut zmax = 0.7 for\ndefiniteness.\nThe efficiency of the observable is determined as:\n\u03ba=\n\n|F\u0303a,FB |\n.\n|F\u0303a,FB | + |F\u0303av,FB |\n\n(33)\n\nIt can be estimated as \u03ba = 0.9028 for the center-of-mass energy 200 GeV and\n\u03ba = 0.9587 for 500 GeV.

Nevertheless, a unique\nsignal of the Abelian Z \u2032 boson can be determined. For this purpose the observR z +\u2206z\nables z00\n(d\u03c3\u0303/dz)dz and \u03c3\u0303FB must be measured. Actually, they are derived\nfrom the normalized deviation of the differential cross-section. If the deviation\n18\n\n\fis inspired by the Abelian Z \u2032 boson both the observables are to be positive\nquantities simultaneously. This feature serves as the distinguishable signal of\nthe Abelian Z \u2032 virtual state in the Bhabha process for the LEP2 energies as well\nas for the energies of future electron-positron collider ILC (\u2265 500 GeV). The\nobservables fix the unknown low energy vector and axial-vector Z \u2032 couplings to\nthe electron current. Their values have to be correlated with the bounds on \u01012\nand v\u0304 2 derived by means of independent fits for other scattering processes.\nWe estimated the observable (34) related to the value of \u01012 . Since in the\nBhabha process the effects of the axial-vector coupling are suppressed with\nrespect to those of the vector coupling, we expect much larger experimental\nuncertainties for \u01012 . Indeed, the LEP2 data lead to the huge errors for \u01012 of\norder 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22124 . The mean values are negative numbers which are too large\nto be interpreted as a manifestation of some heavy virtual state beyond the\nenergy scale of the SM.\nThus, the LEP2 data constrain the value of v\u0304 2 at the 2\u03c3 CL which could correspond to the Abelian Z \u2032 boson with the mass of the order 1 TeV. In contrast,\nthe value of \u01012 is a large negative number with a significant experimental uncertainty. This can not be interpreted as a manifestation of some heavy virtual\nstate beyond the energy scale of the SM.\n\n4.5\n\nMany-parameter fits\n\nTo account for all the accessible data of LEP experiments, we address to many\nparameter fits [17]. As the basic observable to fit the LEP2 experiment data on\nthe Bhabha process we propose the differential cross-section\nd\u03c3 Bhabha\nd\u03c3 Bhabha,SM\n\u2212\ndz\ndz\n\n\u221a \u221a\nz=zi , s= si\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\n\u221a\nwhere i runs over the bins at various center-of-mass energies s.

We\nconsider the combined LEP2 data [1] for these observables (24 data entries\nfor each process). These data are more precise as the corresponding differential cross-sections. Our analysis is based on the fact that the kinematics of\ns-channel processes is rather simple and the differential cross-section is effectively a two-parametric function of the scattering angle. The total cross-section\nand the forward-backward asymmetry incorporate complete information about\n\n19\n\n\fthe kinematics of the process and therefore are an adequate alternative for the\ndifferential cross-sections.\nThe data are analysed by means of the \u03c72 fit [17]. Denoting the observables\n(35)\u2013(36) by \u03c3i , one can construct the \u03c72 -function,\n2\n\n\u03c7 (\u0101, v\u0304e , v\u0304\u03bc , v\u0304\u03c4 ) =\n\nX \u0014 \u03c3 ex \u2212 \u03c3 th (\u0101, v\u0304e , v\u0304\u03bc , v\u0304\u03c4 ) \u00152\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03b4\u03c3i\n\ni\n\n,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u03c3 ex and \u03b4\u03c3 are the experimental values and the uncertainties of the observables, and \u03c3 th are their theoretical expressions presented in Eqs. (26)\u2013(27).\nThe sum in Eq. (37) refers to either the data for one specific process or the combined data for several processes. By minimizing the \u03c72 -function, the maximallikelihood estimate for the Z \u2032 couplings can be derived. The \u03c72 -function is also\nused to plot the confidence area in the space of parameters \u0101, v\u0304e , v\u0304\u03bc , and v\u0304\u03c4 .\nNote that in this way of experimental data treating all the possible correlations are neglected. We believe that at the present stage of investigation this is\nreasonable, because the Collaborations have never reported on this possibility.\nFor all the considered processes, the theoretic predictions \u03c3ith are linear combinations of products of two Z \u2032 couplings\n\u03c3ith =\n\n7\nX\nj=1\n\nCij Aj ,\n\nAj = {\u01012 , v\u0304e2 , \u0101v\u0304e , v\u0304e v\u0304\u03bc , v\u0304e v\u0304\u03c4 , \u0101v\u0304\u03bc , \u0101v\u0304\u03c4 },\n\n(38)\n\nwhere Cij are known numbers.\nIn the Bhabha process, the Z \u2032 effects are determined by three linear-independent\ncontributions coming from \u01012 , v\u0304e2 , and \u0101v\u0304e and the number degrees of freedom\n(d.o.f) M = 3. As for the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 processes, the observables depend on four linear-independent terms for each process: \u01012 , v\u0304e v\u0304\u03bc , v\u0304e \u0101, \u0101v\u0304\u03bc for\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ; and \u01012 , v\u0304e v\u0304\u03c4 , v\u0304e \u0101, \u0101v\u0304\u03c4 for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 (M = 4). Note that\nsome terms in the observables for different processes are the same. Therefore,\nthe number of \u03c72 d.o.f. in the combined fits is less than the sum of d.o.f. for\nseparate processes. Hence, the predictive power of the larger set of data is not\ndrastically spoiled by the increased number of d.o.f. In fact, combining the data\nof the Bhabha and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 (\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) processes together we have to treat\nfive linear-independent terms. The complete data set for all the lepton processes\nis ruled by seven d.o.f. As a consequence, the combination of the data for all\nthe lepton processes is possible.\nThe parametric space of couplings (\u0101, v\u0304e , v\u0304\u03bc , v\u0304\u03c4 ) is four-dimensional. However, for the Bhabha process it is reduced to the plane (\u0101, v\u0304e ), and to the\nthree-dimensional volumes (\u0101, v\u0304e , v\u0304\u03bc ), (\u0101, v\u0304e , v\u0304\u03c4 ) for the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 processes, correspondingly. The predictive power of data is\ndistributed not uniformly over the parameters. The parameters \u0101 and v\u0304e are\npresent in all the considered processes and appear to be significantly constrained. The couplings v\u0304\u03bc or v\u0304\u03c4 enter when the processes e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\nor e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 are accounted for. So, in these processes, we also study the\nprojection of the confidence area onto the plane (\u0101, v\u0304e ).\n20\n\n\fv-e\nv-e\n\n0.01\n\nLEP II\n\n0.01\n\n\u03bc+\u03bce+e-\n\n0\n\n0\n-0.01\n\n-0.01\n\n\u03c4 +\u03c4 -0.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\na-\n\nFigure 5: The 95% CL areas in\nthe (\u0101, v\u0304e ) plane for the Bhabha,\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212\nprocesses.\n\n- +\u03bc,\u03c4\n- +\u03c4 e+e,\u03bc\n\n95% CL\n-0.02\n-0.02\n\n-0.01\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\na-\n\nFigure 6: The projection of the\n95% CL area onto the (\u0101, v\u0304e ) plane\nfor the combination of the Bhabha,\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212\nprocesses.\n\nThe origin of the parametric space, \u0101 = v\u0304e = 0, corresponds to the absence\nof the Z \u2032 signal. This is the SM value of the observables. This point could\noccur inside or outside of the confidence area at a fixed CL. When it lays out\nof the confidence area, this means the distinct signal of the Abelian Z \u2032 . Then\nthe signal probability can be defined as the probability that the data agree with\nthe Abelian Z \u2032 boson existence and exclude the SM value. This probability\ncorresponds to the most stringent CL (the largest \u03c72CL ) at which the point\n\u0101 = v\u0304e = 0 is excluded. If the SM value is inside the confidence area, the Z \u2032\nboson is indistinguishable from the SM. In this case, upper bounds on the Z \u2032\ncouplings can be determined.\nThe 95% CL areas in the (\u0101, v\u0304e ) plane for the separate processes are plotted\nin Fig. 5. As it is seen, the Bhabha process constrains both the axial-vector\nand vector couplings. As for the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 processes,\nthe axial-vector coupling is significantly constrained, only. The confidence areas\ninclude the SM point at the meaningful CLs, so the experiment could not pick\nout clearly the Abelian Z \u2032 signal from the SM. An important conclusion from\nthese plots is that the experiment significantly constrains only the couplings\nentering sign-definite terms in the cross-sections.\nThe combination of all the lepton processes is presented in Fig. 6. There is\nno visible signal beyond the SM. The couplings to the vector and axial-vector\nelectron currents are constrained by the many-parameter fit as |v\u0304e | < 0.013,\n|\u0101| < 0.019 at the 95% CL. If the charge corresponding to the Z \u2032 interactions\nis assumed to be of order of the electromagnetic one, then the Z \u2032 mass should\nbe greater than 0.67 TeV. For the charge of order of the SM SU (2)L coupling\nconstant mZ \u2032 \u2265 1.4 TeV.

The hatched area\nis the 68% CL area from the LEP 1 data on the Bhabha process.\nexclude the Z \u2032 searches at the LHC.\nLet us compare the obtained results with the one-parameter fits. As one can\nsee, the most precise data of DELPHI and OPAL collaborations are resulted in\nthe Abelian Z \u2032 hints at one and two standard deviation level, correspondingly.\nThe combined value shows the 2\u03c3 hint, which corresponds to 0.006 \u2264 |v\u0304e | \u2264\n0.020. On the other hand, our many-parameter fit constrains the Z \u2032 coupling\nto the electron vector current as |v\u0304e | \u2264 0.013 with no evident signal. Why does\nthe one-parameter fit of the Bhabha process show the 2\u03c3 CL hint whereas there\nis no signal in the two-parameter one? Our one-parameter observable accounts\nmainly for the backward bins. This is in accordance with the kinematic features\nof the process: the backward bins depend mainly on the vector coupling v\u0304e2 ,\nwhereas the contributions of other couplings are kinematically suppressed (see\nFig. 2). Therefore, the difference of the results can be inspired by the data sets\nused. To clarify this point, we perform the many-parameter fit with the 113\nbackward bins (z \u2264 0), only. The \u03c72 minimum, \u03c72min = 93.0, is found in the\nnon-zero point |\u0101| = 0.0005, v\u0304e = 0.015. This value of the Z \u2032 coupling v\u0304e is in\nan excellent agreement with the mean value obtained in the one-parameter fit.\nThe 68% confidence area in the (\u0101, v\u0304e ) plane is plotted in Fig. 7. There is a\nvisible hint of the Abelian Z \u2032 boson. The zero point \u0101 = v\u0304e = 0 (the absence\nof the Z \u2032 boson) corresponds to \u03c72 = 97.7. It is covered by the confidence area\nwith 1.3\u03c3 CL. Thus, the backward bins show the 1.3\u03c3 hint of the Abelian Z \u2032\nboson in the many-parameter fit. So, the many-parameter fit is less precise than\nthe analysis of the one-parameter observables.\nAt LEP1 experiments [26] the Z-boson couplings to the vector and axialvector lepton currents (gV , gA ) were precisely measured. The Bhabha process\nshows the 1\u03c3 deviation from the SM values for Higgs boson masses mH \u2265 114\nGeV (see Fig. 7.3 of Ref. [26]). This deviation could be considered as the effect\nof the Z\u2013Z \u2032 mixing. It is interesting to estimate the bounds on the Z \u2032 couplings\nfollowing from these experiments.\nDue to relations (8), the Z\u2013Z \u2032 mixing angle is completely determined by the\n22\n\n\fTable 4: The summary of the fits of the LEP data for the dimensionless contact\ncouplings (6).\nData\nv\u0304e2 , \u00d710\u22124\n\u01012 , \u00d710\u22125\nLEP1\ne\u2212 e+ , 68% CL\n1.25 \u00b1 1.25\nLEP2, one-parameter fits\ne\u2212 e+ , 68% CL\n2.24 \u00b1 0.92\n\u03bc\u03bc, 68% CL\n3.66+4.89\n\u22124.86\n\u03bc\u03bc,\u03c4 \u03c4 , 68% CL\n1.33+3.89\n\u22123.87\nLEP2, many-parameter fits\ne\u2212 e+ , \u03bc\u03bc, \u03c4 \u03c4 , 95% CL\n\u2264 1.69\n\u2264 36.1\n\u2212 +\ne e backward, 68% CL\n2.25+1.79\n\u2264 94.9\n\u22122.07\naxial-vector coupling \u0101.

This gives an upper bound on the Z \u2032 couplings. In this\nway one can estimate whether the Z \u2032 boson is excluded by the experiments or\nnot.\nThe 1\u03c3 CL area for the Bhabha process from Ref. [26] is converted into the\n(\u0101, v\u0304e ) plane in Fig. 7. The SM values of the couplings correspond to the top\nquark mass mt = 178 GeV and the Higgs scalar mass mH = 114 GeV. As it is\nseen, the LEP1 data on the Bhabha process is compatible with the Abelian Z \u2032\nexistence at the 1\u03c3 CL. The axial-vector coupling is constrained as |\u0101| \u2264 0.005.\nThis bound corresponds to \u01012 \u2264 2.5\u00d710\u22125, which agrees with the one-parameter\nfits of the LEP2 data for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 processes (\u01012 = 1.3 \u00b1 3.89 \u00d7 10\u22125\nat 68% CL). On the other hand, the vector coupling constant v\u0304e is practically\nunconstrained by the LEP1 experiments.\nFor the convenience, in Table 4 we collect the summary of the fits of the\nLEP data in terms of dimensionless contact couplings (6). From the analysis\ncarried out we come to conclusion that, in principle, the LEP experiments were\nable to detect the Z \u2032 -boson signals if the statistics had been sufficient.\n\n5\n\nModel independent results and search for Z \u2032\nat the LHC\n\nIn this section we discuss all the assumptions giving a possibility to pick out the\nZ \u2032 signal and determine its characteristics in a model independent way. We also\nnote the role of the present results for the LHC and future ILC experiments.\nAs it was already noted, in searching for this particle at the LEP and Tevatron a model dependent analysis was applied. As the main motivation for this\n23\n\n\fapproach it was the different number of chiral fermions involved in different\nmodels (see, for example, Ref. [7]). In this way the low bounds on mZ \u2032 have\nbeen estimated and the smallness of the Z\u2013Z \u2032 mixing was also observed.\nOn the contrary, in our approach the relations (7) between the parameters of\nthe effective low energy Lagrangians have been accounted for that gave a possibility to determine not only the bounds but also the mass and other parameters\nof the Z \u2032 .\nTo be precise, let us note all the assumptions used in our investigations. We\nanalyzed the four-fermion scattering amplitudes of order \u223c m\u22122\nZ \u2032 generated by\nthe Z \u2032 virtual states. The vertices linear in Z \u2032 were included into the effective\nlow-energy Lagrangian. We also impose a number of natural conditions. The\ninteractions of a renormalizable type are dominant at low energies \u223c mW . The\nnon-renormalizable interactions generated at high energies due to radiation corrections are suppressed by the inverse heavy mass \u223c 1/mZ \u2032 and neglected. We\nalso assumed that the SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y gauge group of the SM is a subgroup\nof the GUT group. As a consequence, all the structure constants connecting\ntwo SM gauge bosons with Z \u2032 have to be zero. Hence, the interactions of gauge\nfields of the types Z \u2032 W + W \u2212 , Z \u2032 ZZ, and other are absent at a tree level. Our\neffective Lagrangian is also consistent with the absence of the tree-level flavorchanging neutral currents (FCNCs) in the fermion sector. The renormalizable\ninteractions of fermions and scalars are described by the Yukawa Lagrangian\nthat accounts for different possibilities of the Yukawa sector without the treelevel FCNCs. These assumptions are quite general and satisfied in a wide class\nof E6 inspired models.\nWithin these constraints for the low energy effective Lagrangian the relations\n(7),(8) have been derived. Correspondingly, the model independent estimates\nof the mass mZ \u2032 and other parameters are regulated by the noted requirements.\nTherefore, the extended underlying model has also to accept them.\nIn this regard, let us discuss the role of the obtained estimates for the LHC.\nAs it is well known (see, for example, [7, 8]), there are many tools at the LHC\nfor Z \u2032 identification. But many of them are only applicable if this particle is\nrelatively light. Our results are in favor to this case.\nNext important point is the determination of Z \u2032 couplings to the various\nSM fermions. As we have shown, the axial-vector couplings of the Z \u2032 to the\nSM fermions are universal and proportional to its coupling to the Higgs field.\nHence we have obtained an estimate of the a = af couplings for both leptons\nand quarks. This is an essential input because experimental analysis for the\nLHC have mainly concentrated on being able to distinguish models and not on\nactual couplings.1 The vector coupling ve was also estimated that, in particular,\nmay help to distinguish the decay of the Z \u2032 resonance state to e+ e\u2212 pairs. Since\nthe couplings ae and ve were estimated there is a possibility to distinguish this\nprocess from the decay of the KK system. In the literature on searching for\nthe Z \u2032 it is also mentioned [8, 27] that the determination of the Z \u2032 couplings\nto fermions could be fulfilled channel by channel, ae , ve , ve,b , ae,b , . . . . In that\n1 Discussion\n\nof the determination of couplings can be found in Ref. [29].\n\n24\n\n\fconsiderations the relations between the parameters have not been taken into\naccount. But this is very essential for treating of experimental data and introducing the relevant observables to measure. Our consideration could be useful\nin this problem.\nOther parameter is the Z\u2013Z \u2032 mixing which is responsible for the different\ndecay processes and the effective interaction vertices generated at the LHC\n[7, 8]. It is also determined by the axial-vector coupling (see Eq. (8)) and\nestimated in a model independent way. Remind that in our analysis the mixing\nwas systematically accounted for. Its value is of the same order of magnitude as\nthe parameters that were fitted in experiments. It worth to note also that the\nexistence of other heavy particles with masses mX \u2265 mZ \u2032 does not influence\nthe RG relations.\nAn important role of the model independent results for searching for Z \u2032 at\nthe Tevatron, LHC and ILC consists, in particular, in a possibility to determine\nthe particle as a virtual state due to a large amount of relevant events. We\nmentioned already that, in principle, LEP2 experiments were able to determine\nit if the statistics was sufficiently large. Experiments at the ILC will increase in\nmany times the data set of interest. In fact, the observables, introduced in sects.\n6 and 7 for picking out uniquely a2f and ve2 couplings in the leptonic scattering\n\u221a\nprocess, are also effective at energies s \u2265 500 GeV and could be applied in\nfuture experiments at ILC.\nOther model independent methods of searching for the Z \u2032 as a resonance\nstate are proposed in the literature (see Refs. [27, 28, 29]). We do not discuss\nthem here because they take into consideration no relations between the parameters. As we mentioned already, the main goal of the present paper is to adduce\nmodel independent information about the Z \u2032 followed from experiments at low\nenergies. Different aspects of Z \u2032 physics at the LHC are out of the scope of it.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this section we collect in a convenient form all the results obtained and make\na comparison with other investigations on searching for Z \u2032 at low energies. In\nfact, this is a large area to discuss. References to numerous results obtained\nin either model dependent or model independent approaches can be found in\nRefs. [7, 8]. Further subdivision can be done into the considerations accounting\nfor any type correlations between the parameters of the low energy effective\ninteractions and that of assuming complete independence of them.

Remind that due to\nthe universality of the axial-vector coupling af the same estimates also hold for\nquarks. First of all, one parameter fits of LEP experiments as well as the manyparameter fit for the e+ e\u2212 backward bins show the hints of the Z \u2032 boson at the\n1-2\u03c3 CL. Due to this fact, the fits allow to determine the maximum likelihood\nvalues of Z \u2032 parameters. In spite of uncertainties, these values can be used as a\nguiding line for the estimation of possible Z \u2032 effects in the Tevatron and LHC\nexperiments. The maximum likelihood values are given in Table 5.

The maximum likelihood value are plotted as\nthe dashed lines. The dotted lines correspond to the maximum likelihood values\nobtained from the LEP1 data.\ndifferent fits obtained for different processes lead to the comparable values of\nthe Z \u2032 parameters.\nIn Table 6 we present the confidence intervals for the fitted parameters. It\ngives a possibility to estimate the uncertainty of the Z \u2032 couplings as well as\nthe lower bounds on the parameters. The results of fits are also shown in Figs.\n8-9. To summarize them we note that the data of the LEP2 experiments are\ncompatible at 1-2 \u03c3 level with the existence of the not heavy Z \u2032 boson.\nNow we compare the above results with the ones of other fits accounting for\nthe Z \u2032 presence. As it was mentioned in Introduction, LEP collaborations have\ndetermined the model dependent low bounds on the Z \u2032 mass which vary in a\nwide energy interval dependently on a model. The same has also been done for\nTevatron experiments. The modern low bound is mZ \u2032 \u2265 850 GeV. It is also\nwell known that though almost all the present day data are described by the\nSM [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 26], the overall fit to the standard model is not very good. In\nlept\nRef.

The values excluded\nat 95% CL by the many-parameter fit of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 are shown in dark\ngray. The left panel represents the results of fits based on the one-parameter\nobservable for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 .

The maximum likelihood\nvalue are plotted as the dashed lines.\nbackward asymmetry Abf b of the bottom quarks and the measurements from\nthe SLAC SLD experiment can be explained for physically reasonable Higgs\nboson mass if one allows for one or more extra U (1) fields, that is Z \u2032 . A specific\nmodel to describe Z \u2032 physics of interest was proposed which introduces two type\ncouplings to the hyper charge Y and to the baryon-minus-lepton number B \u2212 L.\nWithin this model by using a number of precision measurements from LEP1,\nLEP2, SLD and Tevatron experiments the parameters aY and aB\u2212L of the\nmodel were fitted. The presence of Z \u2032 was not excluded at 68% CL. The value\nof aY was estimated to be of the same order of magnitude as in our analysis and\nis comparable with values of other parameters detected in the LEP experiments.\nThe erroneous claim that aY is two order less then the value derived from our\nTable 4 is, probably, a consequence of some missed factors. The upper limit on\nthe mass was also obtained mZ \u2032 \u2264 2.6 TeV .\nThese two analyzes are different but complementary. A common feature of\nthem is an accounting for the Z \u2032 gauge boson as a necessary element of the data\nfits. The results are in accordance at 68-95% CL with the existence of the Z \u2032\nwhich has a good chance to be discovered at Tevatron and/or LHC.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
